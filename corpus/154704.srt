1
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,800
You have anything to drink?

2
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,900
Are you drinking there?

3
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,600
Doctor!

4
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,000
-Cover his head anyway.
-Do as he says.

5
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,900
And what is this?
Get back down there.

6
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,200
We knew him.

7
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,900
-Get back... inside, both of you.
-I'd like to stay.

8
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,000
If they notice we're up here, you'll
wish you were him if you don't already.

9
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,600
We don't need the doctor.

10
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,600
Go! We don't need you.
He's dead.

11
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,200
I said he's dead.

12
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,100
He's alive.

13
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,800
If he's alive,
I'm treating him.

14
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,500
Did anybody tell you
to get him?

15
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,000
I didn't need to be told.

16
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,100
Did anyone say
"Go for the doctor"?

17
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,700
There's no point in arguing.

18
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,300
You see.

19
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,700
Done.

20
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,200
What?

21
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,200
Do it.

22
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,200
No! Please, no!

23
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,200
Easy, now. Easy.

24
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,500
What he wanted, that's all.

25
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:35,300
Don't come for me anymore.
Ask me for nothing.

26
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,300
That's easy.

27
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,800
Make sure
they get his number.

28
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,400
Thank you.

29
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,200
Take the pack.
They're Hungarian.

30
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,600
I like our cigarettes.

31
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,100
It's shit tobacco.

32
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,500
I like ours.

33
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,700
What they need to do is invade Turkey
and then you'll taste a cigarette.

34
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,100
Get going.

35
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,400
You trust the Poles?

36
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,700
What do I care?
The Poles.

37
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,400
They don't trust the Poles.
They don't trust anyone in Number3.

38
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,100
Me?

39
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,500
I can't say.

40
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,900
I'm Hungarian.

41
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,200
But you're here.

42
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,000
So because I'm
with the Poles?

43
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,800
Rosenthal's worried. He's gonna say
that we don't have the time.

44
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,100
I know, we don't have time.
They wait for lulls.

45
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,300
-If the front...
-That's not gonna happen for us.

46
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,000
-No one really knows that...
-Never.

47
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,600
There's planes almost
every day now.

48
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,100
Not for us.

49
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,500
The Russians get 10 km from here we're
the first to go right out to the pyres.

50
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,000
Everyone keeps saying that.

51
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,900
Believe it.
You're dead already, either way.

52
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,600
It's just a matter
of deciding how.

53
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,200
You have gold?

54
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,500
Of course. So I say?

55
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,900
Tell him it's not happening
is what you say.

56
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,400
Get back and tell them.
Go!

57
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,500
Move it out!

58
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,800
It's all a way of putting it off.
Do you need to be here?

59
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,000
Every day counts.

60
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,500
They've been on just as long
as we have. They could go before us.

61
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,300
-I don't understand him.
-He doesn't decide.

62
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,500
He goes along. As far as
I'm concerned... he's no different.

63
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,300
They'd heard
about the old man.

64
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,500
-Who?
-Abramowics.

65
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,600
-What'd he say?
-That... he'd heard.

66
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,300
-Have you told anyone?
-Everyone knows.

67
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,600
The Doctor had no business
there. A man takes pills.

68
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,300
Why are you two in here?

69
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,100
We're nearly finished.

70
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,000
Nearly?

71
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,200
Inside. Yes, nearly.

72
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,400
-But not completely.
-I suppose not.

73
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,200
So I ask the question again.

74
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,500
Three of our men
were shot this morning.

75
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,400
What business is it
of yours?

76
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,800
We're gonna need replacements
and Hungarians.

77
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,400
That's not your problem.

78
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,400
You say we're lazy or disrespectful, but
don't leave us the manpower for the work.

79
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,300
Moll shot Lowenthal,
one of our strongest men.

80
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,200
-You want things to go fast?
-If it's my neck.

81
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,900
We're going to be moving...

82
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,300
Why do you want to do that?

83
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,400
We're thinking of a reprieve.

84
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,300
Our group is happy
to remain here.

85
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,300
Happy?

86
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Why kill us now? We're
the best kommando you've had.

87
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,000
Did I say kill?

88
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,100
We both know
what we're saying.

89
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,700
So I'm a liar.

90
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,200
You're what you are.

91
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,400
It's not my decision.

92
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,600
Of course it's your decision.

93
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,100
No one is
to leave their areas.

94
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,000
You're telling me it's not
you're decision?

95
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,700
No one is to leave
their areas.

96
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,300
-The Doctor leaves.
-The Doctor is different.

97
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,200
There've been people
in the zones.

98
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,500
We haven't been.

99
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,100
We know what we see.

100
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:31,100
You're to keep with your units.
Each to each building.

101
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,500
-The bribes are taken.
-Nevertheless.

102
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,700
But we're going
to need replacements.

103
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Get back inside!

104
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,600
Or I'll be replacing you.

105
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,000
We missed you this morning.

106
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
Missed me?

107
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,400
-The data are on your desk.
-Good.

108
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,100
We've arranged for more forms.
You should have said.

109
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,700
-I'm sorry we had to ask.
-Please.

110
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,000
-What about the lenses?
-They're on the way.

111
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,700
You are an astonishing
pathologist.

112
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,300
Thank you.

113
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,900
-That's not easy for you to hear.
-It isn't.

114
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:58,600
Something in you knows that our
situation is unique.

115
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,100
And as a scientist, you are
as true a one as I've known.

116
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,200
You understand

117
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,000
that when I'm sure every cell in your
body tells you to do otherwise.

118
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,100
They do.

119
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,500
This isn't our war.

120
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,100
Not mine.

121
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,100
Nor mine, I can assure you.

122
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,100
But to allow this all
to go to waist.

123
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,200
I understand your position.

124
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,900
Clearly, you do more than that.

125
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,400
As you wish.

126
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,800
Meaning?

127
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,500
There is no meaning.

128
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,100
We're going to be increasing
the volume of our research.

129
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,800
I shall need more staff.

130
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,600
Then you shall have more staff.

131
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,300
Yes?

132
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,000
-Pardon?
-You want to say...

133
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,300
-It's...
-Yes?

134
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,500
We had discussed last time.

135
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,800
Of course.

136
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,000
This gets you anywhere
in the camp.

137
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,600
-You wait until now?
-Me?

138
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,300
-This is too wrapped up.
-I got it that way.

139
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,400
-From whom?
-I never saw her face.

140
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,600
Where's Tsipora?

141
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,200
Where is she?

142
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,600
And?

143
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,100
And that's all I know.
I'd never seen her before.

144
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,700
-But they have her.
-I said that's all I know.

145
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,600
There's no way they don't.

146
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,300
I know Tsipora. They won't get
a thing out of her.

147
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,800
It doesn't matter.
The point is keep going.

148
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,300
They'll find us like they found her
and until then we get in.

149
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,600
It's hard to guarantee
how much we'll get anymore.

150
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,900
This is a chain.
You find another link.

151
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,400
I just said we did.
We found a stupid link.

152
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,800
So what's the trouble?

153
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,600
You don't walk out
of there everyday.

154
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,000
I do plenty more than that.

155
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,100
This isn't a contest.

156
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:21,000
Then don't make it one.
I'm prepared for anything, Dina.

157
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,600
-And so am l.
-You should be.

158
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,900
So, is there a problem?

159
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,900
If they find us, what do they
do with the rest of our group?

160
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,800
You're risking your own life.

161
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,900
Why should we risk theirs?

162
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,100
You both act
like we put everyone in here.

163
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,600
I don't make you do anything.
Be like them, both of you.

164
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,600
That isn't
what she's saying.

165
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,300
The whole barracks will be punished.
They'll be before they're killed.

166
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,700
Just like us.

167
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,600
What's the fucking difference
when you're dead anyway?

168
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,800
We made the choice,
they haven't.

169
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,400
I'm not listening
to this anymore.

170
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,000
Make sure these get into the cart.
How many bodies are there?

171
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,200
Eight.

172
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,000
You see, that's good.

173
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,200
The more bodies the better.
Get it?

174
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,300
I'll just take these two.

175
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,400
Idiots.

176
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,300
Is she right?

177
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,900
Of course she's right.

178
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,000
What have you been thinking
for the past two months?

179
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,300
I just wish I could slap the shit
out of her is all.

180
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,700
Ist ein problem?

181
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,200
Ist ein problem?

182
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,500
Keine Problem.

183
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,700
I feel sorry for the world
if we don't win the war.

184
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,800
It's your position.

185
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,900
Men are tribal.
We'll end that.

186
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,100
There'll be one tribe.
No war.

187
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,300
There've been wars
within your tribe.

188
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,600
Yes?

189
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,800
Rhoem? The Night
of the Long Knives.

190
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,700
You know a good deal
about Germany.

191
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,700
That, of course,
was a putsch.

192
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,900
What's the difference?

193
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,300
A putsch is not a war.

194
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,800
It's a kind of war.

195
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,800
It's a putsch. If it meant war,
the word would be unnecessary.

196
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,800
Why have two words
for the same thing?

197
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,200
I'm German, you're Hungarian.

198
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,500
I should think I'd be the authority
in this room on the German language.

199
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,800
Of course.

200
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,400
In spite of your obvious
intelligence.

201
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,000
Of course.

202
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:37,100
There's a rumour around the Number3
Crematorium there'll be a rebellion.

203
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,300
The Number 3?

204
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,900
That would involve the First.

205
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,400
That would involve all 4, originating
with the Poles in Number 3.

206
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,300
What would I know?

207
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,500
They think we're going
to kill them.

208
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,000
Don't you always?

209
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,000
This is the best kommando
we've had.

210
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,300
Alright.

211
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,600
You let them know that.

212
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,800
They don't trust me.

213
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,400
You're their doctor.

214
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,300
I'm their doctor
but they know what I do.

215
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,700
What do they do?

216
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,600
They work under gunpoint.

217
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,900
I won't tell them
what I don't believe.

218
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,100
That we'll let them live?

219
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,000
That you'll let any
of us live.

220
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,900
What happens to you has little
to do with me.

221
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,600
You're treated well.
Better than anyone.

222
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,200
You should let us know.

223
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,400
-They're not going to...
-If you hear anything.

224
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,800
That's all.

225
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:39,000
Did you ever consider, Herr
Oberschaarfuhere, that these

226
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,800
headaches might be related...

227
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,100
Yes?

228
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,300
...to the increase, lately,
in the level of cargo.

229
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,400
Go on.

230
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:01,700
What I see in the courtyard, if
I just crack the window for some air.

231
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,800
Anyone would have difficulty.

232
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,500
You shouldn't be looking
out of windows.

233
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,800
-I'm only suggesting...
-Your job is to diagnose.

234
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,800
Alright.

235
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:19,000
If I get upset, if my head aches,
it's because I drink too much.

236
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,100
Then don't drink so much.

237
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,800
That's right,
I won't drink so much.

238
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,400
But that too should stay
between you and me.

239
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,000
-I would never...
-That's right, you would never.

240
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,700
Because you're just
as disposable as I am.

241
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,300
-Herr...
-I don't care! Shut up!

242
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,300
I don't care.

243
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,200
We're each of us a part of it.

244
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,000
Once any of you decide
to live this way.

245
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,400
And you especially.

246
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,500
Yes, Herr Oberschaarfuhrer.

247
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,500
Once you make that choice.

248
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,000
About half are in.

249
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,100
Yes?

250
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,900
Max, you'll botch this.
We don't have any choice.

251
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,400
It started with them.

252
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,600
So a bunch of Poles
from Number 3 get to decide.

253
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,400
They get to stall it until it's right
for them, and it's our people.

254
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,900
Who is our people?

255
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,300
On the fucking trains.

256
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,800
-Because they're Hungarian?
-Yes.

257
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,500
That's because Hungary's the only
country with any Jews left.

258
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,100
But that's your reason?

259
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,600
If we were burning Polish
Jews you wouldn't care?

260
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,900
If we were burning Polish Jews
we wouldn't be waiting.

261
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,000
What's another week
to these guys?

262
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,000
Another ten thousand Hungarians?

263
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,300
They don't care about us.

264
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,100
We're all after
the same thing, Max.

265
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,700
It doesn't seem like it.

266
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,200
Here he is.

267
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,100
Sorry.
It was hell getting over.

268
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,100
How is it over there?

269
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,400
They're locking us all in.

270
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,600
-Who said?
-Lopkowitz.

271
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,200
They're getting ready
to liquidate another section.

272
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,500
Which one?

273
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,800
I'd guess one of the Czechs. Better for
them, anyway. They're all starving.

274
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,300
Give me some vodka.

275
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,200
What's this?

276
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,800
Hungarian wine.
We got it in today.

277
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,300
Any gold?

278
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,300
They haven't come back yet.

279
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,400
Look here.

280
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,100
Check out the diamonds.

281
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Lovely.

282
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,100
-I was gonna get it smelted, but...
-But what?

283
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,300
Smelt it.

284
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,400
Fine.

285
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,500
Looks like we got some god food in.
Smoked oysters, meats, a few cakes.

286
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,100
We should do alright tonight.

287
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,100
We hear you got
more machine guns.

288
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,300
-Who told you?
-Hoffman found out.

289
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,600
-Were you gonna tell us?
-Of course.

290
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,700
Doesn't seem like it.
He just said explosives.

291
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,600
No.

292
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,800
Why do you think I came?

293
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Because Hoffman told you
to come.

294
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,800
No. I told Hoffman.

295
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,300
They were left inside the fence by
the partisans. And twenty grenades.

296
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,900
Who has them now?

297
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:26,900
We do.

298
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,200
So we don't give any more of ours,
you guys are better off now.

299
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,500
When did we ever need
from you?

300
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,800
So what's this business
about waiting?

301
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,000
-We have to re-coordinate.
-Why?

302
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,900
I don't like the way
you talk with me.

303
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,000
You don't like
the way I talk?

304
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,000
I don't like
the way he talks.

305
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,400
Wait, you don't like the way I talk?
It's difficult to understand?

306
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,800
Why are we re-coordinating?

307
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,100
Again.

308
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,300
-We have more guns.
-We had guns.

309
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,300
You think the partisans aren't
wondering why we've done nothing?

310
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,700
You think the women aren't wondering
with the powder they've got in?

311
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,600
-The machine guns.
-So?

312
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,500
What?

313
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,200
Escape.

314
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,900
Wait. Who? Us?

315
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:13,400
You think you think
we'll escape?

316
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,800
With guns.

317
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,300
So we kill more of them.
Destroy three of the crematorium.

318
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,300
And get out.

319
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,800
Is that what you're after?

320
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,300
If I get the chance,
fuck yes.

321
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,500
You tell them, if this is
about escape, we're out.

322
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,100
How can you speak
for all of us?

323
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,700
You gonna speak for yourself?

324
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,600
Are you serious?

325
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,400
What, you're gonna go back
to your normal life?

326
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,700
Forget that. The point
is it doesn't make any sense.

327
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,400
You live to tell.

328
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,100
You're not going to live.
You won't make it to the Vistula.

329
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,700
Others have made it.

330
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,000
Others from the camp,
not from the kommandos.

331
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,200
They'll give up on someone
from Buna, or the camp,

332
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,100
but not anyone who's been
inside the crematorium.

333
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,000
What we could tell they'll
turn Poland upside down.

334
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,300
If we want to accomplish anything,
it has to be one thing.

335
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,600
One end.

336
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,500
And that's the machinery.

337
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,300
You've got to tell them this.

338
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,600
And there's no time left.
Do they know that?

339
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,900
Kommando 8 lasted
three months and a week.

340
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,200
Not with this kind of cargo.
Even Moll admits...

341
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,100
Moll's not going to tell you.
And with them locking us in,...

342
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,300
Do you hear this?
You don't even speak German.

343
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,600
What the fuck does
that matter?

344
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,700
I speak enough.
And I speak Yiddish.

345
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,300
-You speak Yiddish?
-From the Poles.

346
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,100
You heard from the Poles!

347
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,100
Shut up!

348
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,300
Mussfeld told me they
are getting ready to move us.

349
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,400
No group has lasted more
than four months.

350
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,400
-All he's saying is...
-I know what he's saying.

351
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,100
We could be massacred waiting,

352
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,700
like every other group,
thinking we're different.

353
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,200
Which'll be worse even
than ting to escape.

354
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,300
We can tell them
we can work this out.

355
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,400
But it has
to be the crematorium.

356
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,800
Then they can do whatever they want.
You can run to high heaven.

357
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,100
But after we've done
the buildings.

358
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,500
I'd like a bottle
of that wine.

359
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,600
Give us the necklace.

360
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,600
Oh, c'mon.

361
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,400
It's good wine,
you fucking Yid.

362
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:09,000
You won't get that smelted and it'll be of
no use. We can get something for it.

363
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,000
-Two bottles.
-Fuck you.

364
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,400
Hoffman, give him two bottles.

365
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,300
Be careful.

366
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,300
They're liars.

367
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,100
What are they gonna lie about?

368
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,000
He wanted to keep the necklace.

369
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:43,100
He thinks he's going to live.
We're a fucking diversion.

370
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,300
These are Jews.

371
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,400
You keep saying that, Simon.

372
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,400
You trust Jews anymore?

373
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,500
No one would make it?

374
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,700
Suppose even you do.

375
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:06,700
Do you want to look anyone in the face
if any of your family's even alive?

376
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,700
What you've done
For a little more life.

377
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,100
For vodka and bed linens.

378
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,700
Anja, listen to me,

379
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,900
you're gonna die anyway.
We're dead.

380
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,400
They'll find the powder.

381
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,900
Don't say anything.

382
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,900
No matter what they do.

383
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,500
Don't say anything.

384
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,100
I love you.

385
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:24,000
This process of disinfecting is of
vital importance to your health.

386
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,000
One louse can kill you.

387
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,000
Cleanliness brings freedom.

388
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,600
You're all fine.

389
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:34,000
The quicker you get undressed, the
quicker you'll be cleaned, settled,

390
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,100
and reunited
with your families.

391
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,700
Filthy liar.

392
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,100
Remember the number of the hook
you hang your clothes on.

393
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,400
He's a liar.

394
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,400
I can't believe it's
Jews doing this.

395
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,400
He's lying everyone.
He's a liar.

396
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,600
Stop it.

397
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,300
You should listen
to your wife.

398
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,800
Think what you want to think,
but don't cause trouble.

399
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,200
-I'm causing trouble?
-Please.

400
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,400
Look me in the eye and tell me
I'm not gonna be killed.

401
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,900
Hang your clothes on the hooks and keep
them separate from your neighbours.

402
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,200
I'm gonna die, but I'll have lived
longer than you ever will.

403
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,500
You're dead already.

404
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,400
Be quiet. You think you're
gonna change something?

405
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,800
-That's right, what does it matter?
-At least I'll die with my dignity.

406
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,100
-Morris.
-Stop it!

407
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,000
At least I'll die
with my dignity.

408
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,000
How'd you get through
with herewith that?

409
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,100
What?

410
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,200
The watch, is what.

411
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,400
They'd have killed your whole car.

412
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
What does it matter?

413
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,700
See what you've done for yourself
now? Give me the watch.

414
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:34,800
Why?

415
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,300
Give it to me.
You're bathing.

416
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,100
Why do you need the watch
in there?

417
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,200
Get it from me after
of the Nazis will.

418
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,600
-Do as he says, Morris.
-We always do what everyone says.

419
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,900
I'm not giving you anything.

420
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,200
You're attracting
more attention.

421
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,900
Tell me, tell me I'm gonna live,
you fucking Nazi.

422
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,700
Tell me I'm gonna live.

423
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,600
Morris, give him the watch.

424
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,600
He's a liar, everyone.

425
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,000
These Jews are all Nazi liars.

426
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,000
And now he wants
to steal my watch.

427
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,700
-Give me the watch!
-No.

428
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,400
All I want is the fucking watch!

429
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:03,600
No!

430
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,400
No! Give him the watch!

431
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,100
Alright, let's keep it moving.

432
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,000
Remember what hooks you hang
your clothes on.

433
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,400
The hooks are numbered. You'll need
to return once you've showered.

434
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,800
Keep your shoes tied together by
their laces so you don't lose them.

435
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,400
The sooner you shower, the sooner
you'll be fed and reunited.

436
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,800
Move it, move it!

437
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,300
Keep moving inside.

438
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,100
Move it!

439
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,400
Move it! Move it!

440
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,200
David.

441
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,500
Stay.

442
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,700
David?

443
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,700
Do you want a drink?

444
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:10,800
No, thank you.

445
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,600
-You have work.
-Yes.

446
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,300
Always so young.

447
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,900
Adult siblings move away
from one another.

448
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,500
-How's it going?
-Alright.

449
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:56,000
He'll make twins?
With German women?

450
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,500
That's the goal.

451
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,100
What's this?

452
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,400
A gall stone.

453
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,500
What are you keeping it for?

454
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,300
He takes an interest
in such things.

455
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,900
-He collects them?
-I suppose.

456
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,400
In jars?

457
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:20,700
That's how I'm giving it to him. What
he does with it after is his business.

458
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,500
So, have you heard anything?

459
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,400
Heard anything?

460
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,000
-I mentioned last time.
-I told you...

461
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,200
Yes?

462
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,800
They don't speak to me.

463
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,500
You found your wife and daughter.

464
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,400
Who told you?

465
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,100
Does it matter?

466
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,900
I don't suppose.

467
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:53,300
You've been several times.
Brought blankets, medicine.

468
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,300
Yes.

469
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,200
In C-camp, is it?

470
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,000
-He gave you a pass.
-Yes.

471
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:02,800
What did you think
of it over there?

472
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,100
Think?

473
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,700
Did you tell them
what goes on here?

474
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,500
Of course not.

475
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,300
Do they have any idea?

476
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,100
How couldn't they?
Everyone talks.

477
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,700
-You denied it.
-I did.

478
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,000
It's best.

479
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,400
They're going
to be liquidating C-camp.

480
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,000
Who said?

481
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,600
Cuts in administration.

482
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,800
There's not enough food.

483
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,300
In the next two weeks.

484
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,000
We dispose of food.

485
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,500
The order is the order.

486
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,100
The entire section.

487
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,600
Two weeks?

488
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:44,600
That's what I said.

489
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,700
I'll speak with...

490
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,600
What does he have to do
with who stays and who goes?

491
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,800
What does he have to do...?

492
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,500
Because he gave you a pass?

493
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,800
I can assure you it
won't be allowed.

494
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,000
It will be easy to save them.

495
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,200
If there is an uprising
in this camp there will be a massacre

496
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,400
that will far outweigh
anything done to us.

497
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,600
These men will suffer.

498
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,900
That's a strange remark.

499
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,500
We let them live.

500
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,800
For a time.

501
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,100
Even if I...
they don't.

502
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,800
Someone will speak.

503
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,100
I want to know you'll help me.

504
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,400
If I'm spoken to.

505
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,500
Whatever you hear.

506
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:34,500
Yes.

507
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,200
Good.

508
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,900
As for your wife and daughter,

509
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,600
we must go to KZ Administration
and get them transferred.

510
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:45,800
How?

511
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:48,300
Find out which are
the safe convoys out.

512
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,700
They're sending some west
to the munitions factory.

513
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,200
Have them volunteer.
They will be chosen.

514
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:56,700
It's safe?

515
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:00,000
I'm telling you I will make it safe.

516
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,300
That's what I'll do for you.

517
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:05,000
They must keep it a secret,
though.

518
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,100
-If everyone volunteers...
-I know.

519
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,600
They save themselves,
that's all.

520
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:13,600
Just like you.

521
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,200
You and your gall stone.

522
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,900
Your gall stone of a Jew.

523
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,600
How did you get the powder
from the plant?

524
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,600
How did you get the powder
from the plant?

525
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:11,100
It doesn't matter how they
got the fucking powder.

526
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,900
What we need to know
is where it's headed.

527
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,700
I'm asking her that.

528
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,900
You think I don't have ears?

529
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:23,800
You're asking her where it came
from. It came from the plant.

530
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,800
The plant wants to know.

531
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,500
Of course the plant wants
to know.

532
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,200
They should have wondered
that before it happened.

533
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:35,200
You'll kill this one, too before
she tells us who has it now.

534
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:46,900
Where was the powder headed?

535
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,300
Where was the powder headed?

536
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:02,500
This is what you want?

537
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,600
You're going to kill me anyway.

538
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,600
You won't be so lucky.

539
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,900
We will do worse to your entire
block, after we're done with you.

540
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,500
Why don't you just gas them?

541
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:32,700
Revive her.

542
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:48,800
I got the girl.

543
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:50,400
You two got a date?

544
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,100
I said take the fucking body.

545
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:21,600
Why are you up here?

546
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,500
There's a girl...

547
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,400
I said what are you doing
up here?

548
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:28,300
There's a young girl on that cart
who survived the gas.

549
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,300
She's still breathing.
She'll be burned alive.

550
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:43,700
We're taking this one.

551
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:44,900
What do you mean, taking?

552
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:46,100
I mean taking the body.

553
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,000
Let me get the hair.

554
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,500
I said we're taking her,
hair and all.

555
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:52,000
If she leaves with hair,
I need to know why.

556
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,200
She's a twin.

557
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:53,900
What's the trouble?

558
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,000
I need this body
for the Doctor.

559
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:57,300
So let him get the hair.

560
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:00,300
What is it with you people?
We're taking now, with the hair.

561
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:01,800
If she's a twin,
where's the other one?

562
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,300
The other one was caught
before she got on the lift.

563
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:07,900
And why was she killed?
I thought they were taken alive.

564
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,200
Are you saying I'm lying?

565
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,800
I've kept this unit alive
nine months.

566
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:13,700
What do I care?

567
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,400
So you're alive.
We're all alive.

568
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:17,600
We're all shitting gold.
Make your fucking point.

569
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:18,800
I don't want trouble.

570
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:22,300
If you want trouble, send me down
to the Doctor with her head shaved.

571
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:30,400
Take her. What do I care.

572
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,200
Help them.

573
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,300
No, we've got her.
I said we fucking have her.

574
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,400
This will foul everything.

575
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:42,600
It's blood on our hands.

576
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,500
It's a goddam distraction.
And what do we do with her?

577
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:45,800
We figure that out.

578
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:46,700
We'll have to hide her.

579
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:48,800
And not just from them,
but from some of us, too.

580
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:50,800
We do not have time
to be dealing with this.

581
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,100
She was inside.

582
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,600
It'll be and she'll never make it.
What are you thinking?

583
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:00,300
I'm not going to kill her,
alright?

584
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:04,200
Just think if they found her
in the barracks, which they will,

585
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:06,000
because you'll never keep her
without it'll be worse.

586
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,300
How can that be worse?

587
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,200
Worse for her.

588
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:09,700
Forgetting
what they'll do to us.

589
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,100
She's not even conscious. She goes
the way she would have gone.

590
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,900
Meet us at the store room.

591
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,500
I can stop you, Max.

592
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,000
Stop me, then. Do it!

593
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,900
You know we're not killing her.

594
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:29,400
Where's Schlermer?

595
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:30,300
Down the corridor.

596
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:31,000
Where's she?

597
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,000
He won't bring her in until
he talks with the Doctor.

598
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,500
Why? Get him.

599
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:35,800
Who's gonna watch?

600
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,700
What's to watch?
There's no one in the hall.

601
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:38,900
He won't let anyone near her.

602
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:39,900
You'd better get her in here.

603
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:40,700
Go.

604
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,500
I know what you think.
It's not the same.

605
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:48,700
He's scared.

606
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,200
We'll put her on this table.

607
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,700
If anyone were to find out...

608
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:52,600
I know.

609
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,000
We're not murderers.

610
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:55,100
I know that.

611
00:52:58,500 --> 00:52:59,300
We're sorry.

612
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,400
I hadn't been here long enough.

613
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:04,800
-I'm talking about...
-I know what you're talking about.

614
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:07,000
-Of course.
-It doesn't mean I'd act differently.

615
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,600
I've aborted suicides before
and would again.

616
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,200
-I understand.
-Anywhere.

617
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:14,200
I didn't.

618
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,200
I was summoned.

619
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,200
Not by me.

620
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:20,300
After midnight like this, to watch
what amounted to a murder.

621
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,600
Something I hardly need
to be woken for in this place.

622
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:26,000
I'm sorry.

623
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,100
-It's not how we...
-Then don't call for me.

624
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:30,700
I'm sorry.

625
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:33,600
-And you exclude me.
-Exclude you?

626
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,600
I don't know why you do that.

627
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:39,900
He told you?

628
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,100
Yes.

629
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,700
That there's no point.

630
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,400
I can't know
until you bring her in.

631
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:47,000
If there's no hope,
if she's dead already...

632
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,800
I'm at risk here, too.

633
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:51,000
I don't give a shit about you.

634
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:54,500
Bring her in.

635
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:00,700
Hoffman.

636
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,300
Get some blankets,
some tea, some warm broth.

637
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:08,700
Here.

638
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,400
Well put it over her.

639
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:12,600
Not there.

640
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:48,600
How many of those
will you give her?

641
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,200
She's had twenty minutes of gas.

642
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:33,400
Put it there.

643
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,300
It's alright.

644
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:46,800
Some tea.

645
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:02,800
Stop that! Let me do it.

646
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:08,600
Spoon.

647
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:13,400
This is just some tea.

648
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:15,300
Tea.

649
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,000
Good. Good.

650
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,600
-What was this convoy?
-Hungarian.

651
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,300
-Who found her?
-He did.

652
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:35,200
Where?

653
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:37,100
On the bottom.

654
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,100
The young are always
on the bottom.

655
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:41,500
How was she lying?

656
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:43,000
Lying?

657
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,900
It's a simple question.
On her side, what?

658
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:48,100
On her belly.

659
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:53,900
Can you hear me?

660
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:56,700
Hello?

661
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,800
You must speak with me.

662
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,800
Hello.

663
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:08,700
What's your name?

664
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:12,300
Hello.

665
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,100
Hello.

666
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,500
This is gonna take time.

667
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,300
It'll take time.

668
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,500
So simple,

669
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,700
and whom does it harm?

670
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:37,300
It harms only you.

671
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:41,700
If you refuse to tell us
what we're going to know anyway,

672
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:44,900
which is where was
the powder going?

673
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:51,800
Where was the powder going?

674
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:58,800
Is this what you want happening
to the people who have the powder,

675
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:02,300
or to the rest of your block
until we find them?

676
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:10,200
Where was the powder going?

677
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,100
Don't tell them.

678
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:14,500
Don't tell them. Don't tell them.

679
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:18,400
Don't tell them.
Don't tell them.

680
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,800
Don't tell them.
Don't tell them.

681
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:24,800
Don't tell them.
Don't tell them.

682
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,200
You're not supposed
to be in the zones.

683
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:37,500
I'm aware of that.

684
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:41,100
There were two girls caught with
explosives in the Polish section.

685
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,700
You think we're suddenly chummy
with the rest of the camp?

686
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,400
You have another piece
for the way back?

687
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,000
I'll get it there.

688
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,200
You're not supposed
to be in the zones.

689
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:56,400
You said that.

690
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:01,700
Give me the other piece.

691
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,800
And have two for the way back.

692
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,300
Or you won't be slapped,
you'll be shot.

693
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:16,800
No one's gonna harm you here.

694
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:18,400
We're Jews.

695
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,500
Are you Hungarian?

696
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,100
Yes, she's Hungarian.

697
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:24,000
The point is simple questions.

698
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,800
Give us some more
of that soup.

699
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,600
We're going to be found here.

700
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,100
He's right.

701
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,400
We're not moving her.

702
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:42,900
It's been over 2 hours since we started
the lifts. Someone will come right past.

703
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,600
And do we cart her down the hall
without getting through the unit?

704
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:47,300
The unit doesn't know?

705
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:48,600
What would that do?

706
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:50,900
At least get her
off the corridor.

707
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:53,700
Fine. The changing room.

708
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:54,800
The changing room?

709
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:57,100
I said.
Go see if it's clear.

710
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:03,400
We're gonna move you. Into another
room, you'll be more comfortable.

711
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,000
She's alive, you know.

712
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,000
Where can you keep her?

713
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:21,400
We can't.

714
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:23,100
This is a problem.

715
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:24,400
Yeah, it's problem.

716
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:27,000
Because we've revived her.
You understand that.

717
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,900
This wasn't my idea.

718
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:30,200
But she's been revived.

719
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,000
We have a responsibility.

720
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,100
Otherwise...

721
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:33,900
Otherwise?

722
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:35,600
Why did we revive her?

723
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:37,900
-If you tell Mussfeld.
-No.

724
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:40,100
-If you speak with him.
-Me?

725
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:41,900
The two of you.

726
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,000
What? Are friends?

727
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:46,700
None of us is going
to talk with Mussfeld.

728
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:50,500
He will not allow this girl
to live.

729
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,800
He doesn't save people.

730
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,500
Your family?

731
01:00:58,100 --> 01:00:59,300
Who told you?

732
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,500
We heard.

733
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,800
You got the run of C-camp...

734
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,400
and found your wife and kid.

735
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:07,200
You wouldn't do the same?

736
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,500
-And got them out.
-You wouldn't do the same?

737
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,200
-I wouldn't have the chance.
-That's not what I asked you.

738
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,900
I didn't have the chance.

739
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:24,700
If we tell Mussfeld,
she's finished.

740
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:26,300
You hide her.

741
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:27,500
One of the doctors.

742
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:28,500
Impossible.

743
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:30,200
They walk in at all hours.
It has to be...

744
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,000
No. I said no.

745
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:33,200
For a few days.

746
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:34,500
What few days?

747
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,300
We're almost sixteen weeks.

748
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:39,000
Plus with men who've been
who've hardly seen a...

749
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,100
and she's what, fifteen?

750
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:42,700
Put her in your bed.

751
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:45,000
She's not staying with us,
alright? I want her out.

752
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:46,900
Forgetting for a minute
she's a girl,

753
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,900
what do you gain by putting her
with us when we're about to be...

754
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:51,700
Until what?

755
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:53,300
A suitable time.

756
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,100
There isn't going
to be a suitable time.

757
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:56,600
A day or two.

758
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:58,900
We don't have a day or two.

759
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,200
Nonsense.

760
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:05,600
What?

761
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:10,200
There's going to be an uprising.

762
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,000
When?

763
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:16,900
Alright, who?

764
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,600
Numbers 1 and 3.

765
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:19,900
How?

766
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,100
Out of Number 3.

767
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,000
An escape?

768
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:25,500
We're going to destroy
the crematorium.

769
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,700
You'll all be killed.

770
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,200
The things that come out
of your mouth.

771
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,400
We're to be killed
within the week.

772
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:34,800
How do you know?

773
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,500
Like I said, we're almost
four months.

774
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:40,600
We're dead.
Our time's up.

775
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,800
Were you going to ask
for our help?

776
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:47,000
Ask for your help?

777
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:47,900
The doctors.

778
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,600
Were you going to ask
for our help?

779
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,400
Even tell us?

780
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:58,000
I never asked to be doing
what I do.

781
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:00,100
You volunteered.

782
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:02,900
They wanted doctors
for a hospital.

783
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:06,400
You knew the sort of work you'd be
doing, and you continue to do it.

784
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:08,200
I don't kill.

785
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:09,500
And we do?

786
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:11,600
I didn't say that.

787
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,700
You give killing purpose.

788
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,700
We're all just trying
to make it to the next day.

789
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,000
That's all any
of us is doing.

790
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,400
You have no idea, do you?

791
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,300
I don't know
what you're talking about.

792
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,700
I do not wish to be alive
when all of this is over.

793
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:29,500
I don't believe that.

794
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,100
I know you don't.

795
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:34,300
I can help you.

796
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,100
You want to
help?

797
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:39,000
Get rid of this fucking girl.

798
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:09,400
Where have you been?

799
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:10,300
What do we got?

800
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,100
Plenty, but very little gold.

801
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,400
You're gonna have to divvy up.

802
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:14,600
They've got three of the women.

803
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:15,600
Where?

804
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:18,100
Block eleven. Someone says we're
hiding a girl still alive?

805
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:19,700
Keep everyone away
from this area.

806
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,300
-Is it true?
-We'll be up.

807
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:24,700
We heard. We got problems
of our own.

808
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,600
-What's he doing?
-I told him.

809
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:27,600
You told him?

810
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,300
I just told him. Come on.

811
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:45,800
-Why are you here?
-What's this about?

812
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,400
She survived the gas.

813
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:49,900
What're you gonna do with her?

814
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:52,600
What're you gonna do with her?

815
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:54,000
Why is he here?

816
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,700
They caught three of the women
for the Unio, found powder.

817
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:57,800
Here?

818
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,500
In the camp.

819
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:00,700
How do you know?

820
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,400
They didn't come with the powder
and we found out. As far as we know...

821
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:08,100
They've been stealing and they aren't
going to find out where it was going?

822
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:09,500
I didn't say that.

823
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:12,000
-They are being tortured right now?
-Of course they are.

824
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:16,500
How long did you expect this
to go on, before they were caught?

825
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,200
-We couldn't have...
-We couldn't have what?

826
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:22,800
We couldn't mustered together at any
time once we decided it was time...

827
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,800
-No, we couldn't...
-Oh, God dam, no we couldn't have.

828
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,100
That's a lie.

829
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:26,900
It was...

830
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:30,000
-It was who? The Poles?
-No, it was the whole group.

831
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:34,100
So we waited for this to be killed
without the chance.

832
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,800
There are two women
being tortured right now.

833
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:37,000
Why are they being tortured?

834
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,900
Why are we still burning day
after day?

835
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:42,300
Because we've waited. Because
suddenly this became about escape.

836
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,100
And let's get it straight,
Hesh.

837
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:48,300
You were gonna deal us out.
We were just a fucking diversion.

838
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:50,100
How many times does this have to be gone over?

839
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:54,400
Every gun you guys have got you've
kept and we find out about it later.

840
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,300
Not shit from you guys.

841
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:58,700
Only plans and delays.
Your plans.

842
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
We changed our plans.

843
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:03,200
Changed your plans, but only
after we decided we'd be out.

844
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:05,400
Had to make a deal,
re-coordinate.

845
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:09,300
But were you gonna stay wait
until two crematoria were done,

846
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:11,100
or let us do that and run run,

847
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,400
like you always wanted to,
while we stayed and fought?

848
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:14,400
I don't know.

849
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:17,600
But when we're through
with the machinery, I can't run?

850
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:21,200
I have to stay here and be shot
because that's what you want to do?

851
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:23,200
Because you can't live
with it, I can't?

852
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:24,300
Fuck you, Max.

853
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:27,200
It's my fucking life.
I hope I live till I'm ninety.

854
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:30,300
Now we're ready to go today.

855
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:31,300
-What?
-Today?

856
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:32,700
Between the shifts.

857
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:34,800
Why else am I here?
To argue with this idiot?

858
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:37,300
-Who starts the fire?
-Us.

859
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:40,400
You see how easy it is once
the decision is made.

860
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
We have to tell the unit.

861
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:45,500
An hour. Everyone knows
what to do. It's a matter of when.

862
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:47,300
What about the girl?

863
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:48,700
What about her?

864
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
What do we do with her?

865
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:51,200
What do we do with her?

866
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:54,000
-It's got to be now, Max.
-We get her in the fence.

867
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:55,400
Out?

868
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:57,600
-The fence into the camp.
-You'll never.

869
01:06:57,900 --> 01:06:59,700
-In a group we could.
-A group is worse.

870
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:01,100
-It doesn't have to be.
-We're locked in.

871
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:02,200
Don't do this.

872
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:03,400
An excuse could be found.

873
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:04,400
The Doctor's right.

874
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:07,000
We shave her head, dress her
she looks like a boy.

875
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:08,400
What happens on the other side
of the fence?

876
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:09,600
She gets taken in.

877
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:10,800
-Which camp?
-Does it matter?

878
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:12,900
Yes, it matters.
What do they do with her?

879
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,500
How do they account
for the extra...?

880
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:18,100
This is Germans we're talking about.
They stand corpses up in the snow...

881
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:20,400
They're going to suspect
someone of breaking in?

882
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:21,600
Breaking in from here.

883
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:22,900
She's not even numbered.

884
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:26,500
Don't fuck this up for one life!
You'll be shot and so will she.

885
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,500
Then there's alert
and today's impossible.

886
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:29,600
He's right, Max.

887
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:32,300
It'll drag us down.
No single person is worth that.

888
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:35,400
Look at her.

889
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,200
Does she even have a mind left?
Can she speak?

890
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:39,800
We don't know.

891
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:42,000
Can you speak?

892
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:47,500
The gas got to her.

893
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:49,200
Why are you even considering?

894
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:50,600
-We don't kill people.
-We don't?

895
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:53,700
We put them in the rooms,
walk them in and strip,

896
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,300
them look them in the face
and say it's safe.

897
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:56,400
What the hell is that?

898
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:57,200
-It's not...
-It's not what?

899
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:58,600
It's not pulling the trigger.

900
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:00,300
You leave the room.

901
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:03,900
Bring them in and leave say it's safe,
you'll see them when it's over.

902
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:07,400
Who put her inside? Now you
think she made it through.

903
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:09,100
God knows how you're a hero.

904
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:10,200
Not a hero.

905
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,100
Not a hero, not a killer.
What are you, Max?

906
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:15,200
Better we do it than them.
I'll make it easy for you.

907
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:16,900
We can solve this another way.

908
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:18,000
I'll fucking kill you!

909
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:19,100
You won't do shit.

910
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:21,300
We're not going to kill her,
alright?

911
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:24,500
I'm not saying we shouldn't have,
but we're not gonna do it now.

912
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:52,700
On the bench here.

913
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:54,700
What about me?

914
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:55,900
What about you?

915
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,500
If he sees me we're fucked
if he sees me.

916
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,100
There's hundreds of He's not
gonna know you. Just keep still.

917
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:01,700
He wanders around half drunk.

918
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:03,800
It's a fucking check.

919
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:12,900
Why is this door shut?

920
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,500
We were organizing
the morning muster.

921
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:17,000
Organizing?

922
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:18,500
With Lowenthal... gone.

923
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:19,900
We settled that.

924
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:22,400
Yes, Herr Oberschaarfuhrer,
but now with one short...

925
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:24,400
Who's going to replace him?

926
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:25,900
He is.

927
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:29,800
He's not capable.

928
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:32,800
You!

929
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,100
Yes, Herr Oberschaarfuhrer.

930
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:36,500
And who replaces him
is your business.

931
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,000
That's just the thing.

932
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:41,100
-What happens with...
-The duties in the room stay the same.

933
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:42,200
Yes, sir.

934
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,100
It's miserable outside.

935
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:55,400
I've grown to hate Poland.

936
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,400
How are you, Doctor?

937
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:06,600
I'm well.

938
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:11,100
Do you want to come over
for a drink?

939
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:14,700
I have some Hungarian wine
some brandy.

940
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:16,900
Later.

941
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:19,500
-If you've got a chill...
-I said no.

942
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,300
There's a convoy arriving,

943
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:27,000
and your group haven't finished
with the cargo from this morning.

944
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:30,000
-We just have to...
-You have to clear the elevators.

945
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:31,300
Yes, sir.

946
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:33,800
And it's filthy down there.

947
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:20,300
Yes?

948
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:23,000
What?

949
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:25,200
Why are you here?

950
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,000
Here?

951
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:31,700
This isn't your unit.
This isn't your building.

952
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:33,900
To help.

953
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:35,800
How did you get over?

954
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:37,200
I was moved.

955
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:39,500
-By whom?
-Almaier.

956
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:42,400
That's not true, is it?

957
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:44,600
Of course it's true.

958
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:04,300
That's how it'll go
for all of us.

959
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:08,100
First you, then us.

960
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:12,600
The last thing to do
is smile.

961
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,400
Your bombers only speed it all up.

962
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:23,000
We'll dispose of as many of you
as we can before they do it to us.

963
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:27,100
Why was he here?

964
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:28,200
He was moved.

965
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:29,600
He was not moved!

966
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:31,500
You were to stay
with your groups.

967
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:35,900
Why were the women
from the Unio hoarding powder?

968
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:41,500
Why were the women
from the Unio hoarding powder?

969
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:46,400
We let you live.

970
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:48,300
You're not gonna let us live.

971
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:51,700
If something is attempted,
that's certain.

972
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:54,700
If you think we have powder,
tear apart the crematorium.

973
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,100
Move away from the bench.

974
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:09,900
Where did she come from?

975
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:14,200
Doctor?

976
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:16,700
Everybody out.

977
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:18,500
You give orders now?

978
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,700
It won't help anyone
if there's a row.

979
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:23,200
How will the work get finished?

980
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:26,600
Everyone out.
I'll take care of this.

981
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:28,200
What do you mean,
take care of this?

982
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:29,500
I want what you want.

983
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:30,900
Don't speak Hungarian!

984
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,500
What are you saying?

985
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,500
Leave quietly. Leave.

986
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:39,600
Let's go.

987
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:41,800
Save her. You've got
to fucking save her.

988
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:45,800
Shut him up. Take this with you.
And burn it with the others.

989
01:13:57,200 --> 01:14:01,100
I've seen them strike the ones
that are slow getting in.

990
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,400
Hey steal, lie to each other.

991
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:09,000
I never fully despised
the Jews

992
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:13,600
until I experienced how easily they
could be persuaded to do the work.

993
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,200
To do it so well.

994
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,600
And to their own people.

995
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:21,500
They'll be dead
by week's end eve soul

996
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:25,200
and we'll replace them
with others' no different.

997
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:28,900
Do you know how easy that'll be?

998
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:38,900
Who are you?

999
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:42,300
She doesn't speak German.
I don't even think she speaks.

1000
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:46,300
-You don't understand me?
-She's from a convoy.

1001
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:49,900
I didn't imagine she's
from Osweicum.

1002
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:52,900
-This morning's convoy?
-Of course.

1003
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:55,500
So you're Hungarian.

1004
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,700
They took her out
from the undressing room?

1005
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:07,600
Why her?

1006
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:09,900
She's related to someone?

1007
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:11,300
She survived.

1008
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:13,300
Survived what?

1009
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:14,900
The gas.

1010
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:19,900
All I can think is that,
with the wet floor...

1011
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:21,400
It kills everyone.

1012
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:27,400
If there was a pocket of wet air...
Should we speak in private?

1013
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:32,500
If she doesn't speak German,
what's the problem?

1014
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,900
I find it difficult to stand here
and discuss while...

1015
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:37,800
What's to discuss?

1016
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:48,000
I have the information
you requested.

1017
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:50,100
The information?

1018
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:51,900
At the time you saved my wife
and child.

1019
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:53,300
Tell me here.

1020
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:56,300
I don't want to tell you here.

1021
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:02,800
You.

1022
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,700
Stay here with her.

1023
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:12,100
If you take her out from here,
both of you will be killed.

1024
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:15,700
Stay here.

1025
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,800
I used to think so much
of myself.

1026
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,700
What I've made of my life.

1027
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:10,600
We can't know what
we're capable of, any of us.

1028
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:17,100
How can you know what you'd do to
stay alive until you're really asked?

1029
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:21,000
I know this now.

1030
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:24,000
For most of us,

1031
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:28,400
the answer is anything.

1032
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:34,600
It's so easy to forget
who we were before.

1033
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:40,100
Who we'll never be again.

1034
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:43,500
There was this old man.

1035
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,500
He pushed the carts.

1036
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:49,400
And on our first day,

1037
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:53,100
when we had to burn
our own convoy,

1038
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:56,600
his wife was brought up
on the elevator.

1039
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:59,200
Then his daughter.

1040
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:02,300
And then both his grandchildren.

1041
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:06,900
I knew him.

1042
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:08,900
We were neighbours.

1043
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:13,000
And in twenty minutes,

1044
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:18,400
his whole family and all its future
was gone from this earth.

1045
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:25,600
Two weeks later he took pills
and was revived.

1046
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:30,200
We smothered him
with his own pillow.

1047
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:33,000
And now I know why.

1048
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:37,300
You can kill yourself.
That's the only choice.

1049
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:44,000
I want them to save you.

1050
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:47,900
I want them to save you more
than I want anything.

1051
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,900
I pray to God we save you.

1052
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,100
You can hear me, can't you?

1053
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:02,600
I thought so.

1054
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:09,700
Yes. I thought so.

1055
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
I don't understand, Doctor.

1056
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,600
I don't know
how I can make it clearer.

1057
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:21,000
Dr. Mengele says you're
the best surgeon he's seen ever.

1058
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:23,400
I Jew, even, and he admits it.

1059
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:25,200
Which is astonishing.

1060
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,800
He says you do the work
of five men.

1061
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:30,300
That without you his research
would be impossible.

1062
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:31,800
Where is this leading?

1063
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,200
Your expertise
has quintupled the torture.

1064
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:35,200
I haven't...

1065
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:37,800
Has quintupled the torture
of children in this camp,

1066
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:39,300
and that is fact!

1067
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:43,300
So that you can live here as you do,
which is better than any other Jew.

1068
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:46,000
And better than all
but a handful of Germans.

1069
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:47,500
Including me.

1070
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:50,400
I haven't seen you once protest

1071
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:53,300
and as the workload has increased.

1072
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:55,300
And you've saved your family.

1073
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:57,100
We do what we do.

1074
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:00,100
You make up for that
with the life of this one girl?

1075
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:01,600
I don't pretend.

1076
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:02,800
Good.

1077
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:04,200
Don't.

1078
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,600
And who is to die in her place?

1079
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:09,000
No one lives here
without someone else dying.

1080
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:10,000
I don't believe that.

1081
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:11,000
It's a fact of the camp.

1082
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:12,300
It's numbers.

1083
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,200
There's only so much food,
so much room.

1084
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:15,700
This is one child.

1085
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,400
Which you could say about anyone.

1086
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:19,200
Your wife and daughter.

1087
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:21,900
You save one, you take the life
of another.

1088
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:25,100
Put her in a bed, give her food
someone else doesn't get,

1089
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:27,200
dies or is removed.

1090
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:30,700
To save her
is a meaningless lie.

1091
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:33,100
It's your lie,
Herr Oberschaarfuhrer.

1092
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:35,400
We want the girl to live.

1093
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:41,500
If you tell me this information,
I will spare the girl.

1094
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,400
There's going to be an uprising.

1095
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:46,600
When?

1096
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:49,100
I don't know. They don't want me
to be a part of it.

1097
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:51,300
And they have powder.
The women got them powder?

1098
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:54,100
-I said I don't know.
-Why did they tell you?

1099
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:56,100
Because of the girl.
Because they wouldn't hide her.

1100
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:58,500
-Who told you?
-The one you killed.

1101
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:00,000
How did you speak with him?

1102
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:02,300
He was here, wasn't he?
That's why you shot him.

1103
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:04,200
No one else here speaks with me.

1104
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:08,000
-But they have powder?
-I don't know.

1105
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:10,400
-Weapons?
-I don't...

1106
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,000
But powder from the women.
That's where the powder went.

1107
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:14,600
I've heard nothing else.

1108
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:18,700
-This information is useless to me.
-It's all I was told.

1109
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
It's not worth the life
of the girl.

1110
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:23,900
You agreed.

1111
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:28,700
Wrong, Doctor. I agreed to save your
wife and daughter, which I have done.

1112
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:32,400
Herr Oberschaarfuhrer...

1113
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:34,400
There's nothing more to discuss.

1114
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,800
What about your headaches
and your drinking?

1115
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:45,200
Excuse me?

1116
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,200
I'll tell him you're unfit.

1117
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:55,100
And they won't move you
somewhere else.

1118
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:58,100
I'll want to see her.

1119
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:01,400
Not a hair on her head,
and on the other side.

1120
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Through the fence,
if you'd like,

1121
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:07,600
but numbered, shaved and alive.

1122
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:12,700
And to live isn't to kill,
Herr Oberschaarfuhrer.

1123
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,700
Because we are not doing
the killing.

1124
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:20,100
No. Please, no!

1125
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:25,800
Because she knew.
Because all of you know.

1126
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:30,200
And these two know.

1127
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:36,300
I could say I don't want to be doing
this but that wouldn't be true.

1128
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:41,600
It's less bodies for us
to worry about.

1129
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:43,700
Keep track of.

1130
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:44,900
Feed.

1131
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:49,100
So, do us a favour
and remain silent.

1132
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:54,000
But you don't seem
to be enjoying it,

1133
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:57,600
murdering your friends
to protect,

1134
01:22:58,300 --> 01:22:59,300
who?

1135
01:22:59,900 --> 01:23:02,500
Polish partisans who hate you?

1136
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:04,300
Sold Jews,

1137
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,100
and stole from Jews early
in the war.

1138
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:17,600
One by one...

1139
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:19,800
We can do this until we're done
with your whole group,

1140
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,600
and then we'll move
to the next block.

1141
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:25,700
Or one of you any of you

1142
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:31,400
tell us where the powder is,
where it was headed.

1143
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:34,200
They don't know.
None of them know.

1144
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:36,800
Tell them, please.
Tell them.

1145
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:38,900
They don't know.
Don't you think they would say?

1146
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:41,100
You know, and you're silent.

1147
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:42,300
Stop the killing.

1148
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:46,000
You know, because you had
to have been approached.

1149
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:50,200
And you are getting it
for somewhere.

1150
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:53,100
Stop the killing.

1151
01:23:56,900 --> 01:23:58,300
Please. Please.

1152
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,100
No! No!

1153
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:02,800
Don't shoot her!

1154
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:27,500
Get a proper count.

1155
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:51,300
It's all sentimental.

1156
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:55,400
Do you understand sentimental?

1157
01:24:57,900 --> 01:25:00,100
Because they look you
in the eye twice.

1158
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:03,100
Once before and once after.

1159
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:06,300
Suddenly they believe
in heroics.

1160
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:11,400
You wait here.

1161
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:18,000
Hold her in here
until I get back.

1162
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:19,600
Don't leave her.

1163
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:28,300
They're saving her.

1164
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:30,100
No, Max, the Doctor
will make certain.

1165
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:31,700
You saw, or they told you?

1166
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,100
The Doctor told me.

1167
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:34,200
We did this.

1168
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:35,400
Listen to me, listen.

1169
01:25:35,700 --> 01:25:38,700
What's going to happen to her will happen,
no matter what you do or see.

1170
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:40,600
You're right, we did it.
We saved her.

1171
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,700
The best thing you can do is to finish
the day quietly and wait for later.

1172
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,200
That's it.

1173
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:47,900
That's it for you.

1174
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:49,700
The goddam end.

1175
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:53,500
Hoffman, you have to get over to the
Third, tell them about Abramowics.

1176
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:55,100
How am I to get through?

1177
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:56,300
We'll load you up.

1178
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:57,200
Here.

1179
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:00,500
Exactly what happened.

1180
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:01,800
I don't speak Yiddish.

1181
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:03,800
Well, you can fucking convey
somebody getting shot.

1182
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:07,200
And don't try to come back.
We're not waiting for you.

1183
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:09,500
-I talked to her.
-Yes?

1184
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:11,200
I talked, she understood.

1185
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:12,600
What are you saying?

1186
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:15,800
-We were alone while...
-Did she talk?

1187
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:17,400
I said I talked.

1188
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:18,700
What did you say?

1189
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:20,900
-Everything.
-Everything?

1190
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:24,900
You told her?

1191
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:26,700
You would have, too.

1192
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,100
What do you know
what I would do.

1193
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:29,200
You would have.

1194
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:30,600
What does that do for her?

1195
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:31,600
Maybe it did something for me.

1196
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:34,100
Fuck what it did for you!

1197
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:35,700
What do you need?

1198
01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:37,000
She'll know who we were.

1199
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:38,800
And why does she need
to know that?

1200
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:40,300
I don't know.

1201
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:42,000
That's right. You don't know.

1202
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:43,100
Do you?

1203
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:46,100
-Get going.
-Fuck off! I'm going.

1204
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:49,900
Do you?

1205
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,100
Fire! There's fire!

1206
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:55,700
He said between the shifts.

1207
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:07,600
Cohen, Lowy, we won't have time
to organize the groups.

1208
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:11,900
Get the guns and down into the
corridors and barricade the doors.

1209
01:27:12,700 --> 01:27:13,600
Let's go!

1210
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:15,700
Let's go, let's go!

1211
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:33,000
Go see what's happening.

1212
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:55,500
Get the fuel drums.

1213
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:35,300
Have you seen the Oberschaarfuhrer?

1214
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:38,700
Have you seen the Oberschaarfuhrer
or any SS men with a young girl.

1215
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:39,500
No!

1216
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:42,100
Please, have you seen
a young girl? She was alive.

1217
01:29:12,900 --> 01:29:14,400
We've only got two drums up there.

1218
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,200
We're nearly out of explosives.

1219
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:17,900
They're only the machine guns.

1220
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:20,700
I don't need to know.
Go tell Schlermer.

1221
01:29:36,100 --> 01:29:38,100
We're dead up here.
Move down, move down!

1222
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,200
Kaminski needs bodies
in the furnace room.

1223
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:00,700
We're setting the explosives.

1224
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:02,800
Have you seen Mussfeld
with a girl?

1225
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:04,900
We need you in the furnace room.

1226
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Come on!

1227
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:10,200
Get out! Get out!

1228
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,800
Get out! Get out!

1229
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:37,900
Get out!

1230
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:42,600
Surrender if you want to live.

1231
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:45,300
It's over.
We're gonna blow the room!

1232
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:54,700
Do it!

1233
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:45,000
Why don't they kill us.

1234
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:48,300
Did you ever see her?

1235
01:32:49,700 --> 01:32:50,800
No. Did you?

1236
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:53,800
Why am I asking?

1237
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:56,400
Why aren't they killing us?

1238
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:58,700
The Russians will be here
before the year's out.

1239
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:04,000
If it weren't that, we would
never have pulled this off.

1240
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:07,200
You hid.

1241
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:12,000
Will I be killed?

1242
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:14,800
Do you want to be killed?

1243
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:18,900
You would have fought.

1244
01:34:20,900 --> 01:34:22,100
Wouldn't you have?

1245
01:34:28,700 --> 01:34:30,400
I've spoken with Dr. Mengele,

1246
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:35,000
and assured him that you had
nothing to do with any of this.

1247
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:39,000
That you knew and did nothing.

1248
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:44,900
You will continue
with your work.

1249
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:53,800
That's right, Doctor.

1250
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,400
We will both continue
with our work.

1251
01:34:59,700 --> 01:35:01,400
Because that's
what the living do.

1252
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
We will have saved each other,
then.

1253
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:09,700
We needn't save anyone else.

1254
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:27,800
In Budapest, mostly.

1255
01:35:28,700 --> 01:35:30,000
My wife was from the city.

1256
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:33,200
But we stayed north.

1257
01:35:34,900 --> 01:35:36,300
I still don't know why.

1258
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:38,100
It's beautiful there.

1259
01:35:38,300 --> 01:35:39,200
Yes, it is.

1260
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:42,900
But we were finally gonna move
near her family.

1261
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,100
-Where did they live?
-Near the markets.

1262
01:35:47,900 --> 01:35:49,400
We would be neighbours.

1263
01:35:57,700 --> 01:35:58,900
Will they kill her?

1264
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:01,600
They're gonna show her this
then let her live.

1265
01:36:02,700 --> 01:36:04,600
But why wouldn't
they have done it already.

1266
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:07,700
You're asking for reasons.

1267
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:09,500
I guess I was.

1268
01:36:23,700 --> 01:36:25,100
We did something.

1269
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:28,400
Yes.

1270
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:30,600
We did.

1271
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:35,000
Yes. Bye.

1272
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:41,800
Neighbours.

1273
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:35,800
After there vo It,
half the ovens remain

1274
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:39,200
and we are carried
to them together.

1275
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:47,300
I catch fire quickly.

1276
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:57,400
The first part of me rises
in dense smoke

1277
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:01,600
that mingles
with the smoke of others.

1278
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:07,500
Then, there are the bones,

1279
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:10,500
which settle in ash.

1280
01:39:11,300 --> 01:39:15,600
And these are swept up
to be carried to the river.

1281
01:39:18,100 --> 01:39:19,300
And last,

1282
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:25,100
bits of our dust
simply float there,

1283
01:39:25,700 --> 01:39:29,500
in air, around the working
of the new group.

1284
01:39:31,700 --> 01:39:34,500
These bits of dust are grey.

1285
01:39:35,900 --> 01:39:39,300
We settle on their shoes
and on their faces

1286
01:39:40,300 --> 01:39:42,100
and in their lungs.

1287
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:46,100
And they become so used to us,

1288
01:39:46,900 --> 01:39:52,400
that's on they don't cough
and they don't brush us away.

1289
01:39:54,900 --> 01:39:57,900
At this point, they're just moving,

1290
01:39:58,600 --> 01:40:00,800
breathing and moving.

1291
01:40:01,700 --> 01:40:05,000
Like any one else, still alive
in that place.

1292
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:11,400
And this is how
the work

1293
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:15,700
continues.
