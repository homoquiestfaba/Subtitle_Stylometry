They're everywhere. It seems as if

The school is paralyzed. There's no

It's like Baghdad around here!

By revealing his misuse
of Adams College funds.

1201
01:17:37,417 --> 01:17:40,181
Lewis has been misusing
Adams funds?

1202

Remember those papers

1203

- Yeah.
- Well, Lewis doesn't know it...

of his monthly appropriation...

the college needs.

1206

Like what?

1207
01:17:53,667 --> 01:17:58,195
Like procuring women for the football players,
new yacht, Lear jet-

things the school needs.

1209

- Not necessary?
