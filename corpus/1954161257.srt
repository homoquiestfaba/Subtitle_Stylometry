1
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,418
Pasadena, home to little old ladies,
noble laureates...

2
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:55,188
high tech science,
beautiful museums...

3
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:58,257
and a Pulitzer
Prize winner or two.

4
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:03,295
Welcome to a city
where people still read.

5
00:01:31,354 --> 00:01:34,224
Are you looking
for anything special?

6
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:39,395
-Do you like thrillers?
-Not particularly.

7
00:01:39,796 --> 00:01:41,631
It's a pretty good one.

8
00:01:43,199 --> 00:01:46,001
-I didn't think Hitler had children.
-Well...

9
00:01:46,302 --> 00:01:51,440
none that we know of, but what
if Hitler had a child with...

10
00:01:51,673 --> 00:01:54,543
Eva Braun...

11
00:01:54,743 --> 00:01:58,914
then raised in Argentina by the Nazis
to follow in his father's steps.

12
00:02:01,716 --> 00:02:04,018
That's so ridiculous!

13
00:02:04,218 --> 00:02:07,087
Well, it's a premise, and
they're allowed to be ridiculous.

14
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:09,790
Thanks, but I'm gonna
keep looking.

15
00:02:10,024 --> 00:02:14,562
-A 25-dollar-book for 3,99.
-Not, if I don't buy it.

16
00:02:14,795 --> 00:02:16,296
Right.

17
00:02:18,398 --> 00:02:20,367
Is this you?

18
00:02:22,202 --> 00:02:27,106
-Did you write this book?
-It took 7 years out of my life...

19
00:02:27,307 --> 00:02:29,275
but don't let that influence you.

20
00:02:29,475 --> 00:02:31,343
Would you sign this for me?

21
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,681
-Are you sure?
-Sure!

22
00:02:37,382 --> 00:02:39,518
-What would you like me to say?
-You're the author.

23
00:02:48,025 --> 00:02:49,594
Thanks.

24
00:02:51,395 --> 00:02:54,565
-"Enjoy". I definitely will.
-Please, do.

25
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,901
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

26
00:02:57,301 --> 00:02:59,069
-Bye.
-Bye.

27
00:03:09,979 --> 00:03:12,115
This is the story of Byron Tiller...

28
00:03:13,149 --> 00:03:16,952
a modest man living in a modest
Pasadena neighborhood.

29
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:20,188
A neighborhood built for
middle income families...

30
00:03:20,389 --> 00:03:23,358
when the middle was still closer
to the top than the bottom.

31
00:03:23,558 --> 00:03:25,527
-Say "hi" to mom!
-Hi.

32
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,996
-Hi, how are you? You know?
-No.

33
00:03:29,397 --> 00:03:32,166
-I sold a book today.
-Hey, that's good!

34
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,337
I haven't done the math, but I think
it'll bring us another 3 cents.

35
00:03:36,571 --> 00:03:40,441
-Course the taxes will kill us.
-The important thing is, honey...

36
00:03:40,641 --> 00:03:44,344
...people are reading your work.
-I went to Rizzoli's.

37
00:03:45,011 --> 00:03:48,649
Couldn't find it but I turned around
and there it was: 7 years of my life.

38
00:03:48,882 --> 00:03:54,053
In the remainder bin, along with
cookbooks, self-help...

39
00:03:54,287 --> 00:03:58,224
...and achieving orgasms.
-If orgasms don't get full price...

40
00:03:58,424 --> 00:04:00,626
...you have nothing to be ashamed of.
-What is this?

41
00:04:00,859 --> 00:04:01,960
What?

42
00:04:02,194 --> 00:04:03,696
Did Heinz die or something?

43
00:04:03,929 --> 00:04:07,366
The man makes 57 varieties
and we can't afford any of them?

44
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,668
Why pay extra for a label?

45
00:04:10,135 --> 00:04:14,205
How many diapers is Nathaniel still
going through? In one week?

46
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:19,076
That depends on if he decides to spit
his food up instead of swallow it.

47
00:04:19,377 --> 00:04:22,746
And when does he decide to take
muscle control seriously?

48
00:04:23,281 --> 00:04:25,149
Three, I think.

49
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:28,451
Then my new book
better get published...

50
00:04:30,453 --> 00:04:31,989
quick.

51
00:04:34,424 --> 00:04:37,760
I don't want you to have a worry,
champ. Dad's gonna take care of you.

52
00:04:38,628 --> 00:04:42,331
You go to sleep now,
Mr. Nathaniel Hawthorne Tiller.

53
00:04:43,098 --> 00:04:44,734
I love you.

54
00:04:48,036 --> 00:04:49,738
What are you doing in there?

55
00:04:49,972 --> 00:04:54,443
I'm moving his head. Making sure
it doesn't flatten out on one side.

56
00:04:54,676 --> 00:04:57,645
It hardened two years ago.
Come to bed.

57
00:04:57,913 --> 00:04:59,781
Come to bed?

58
00:05:00,715 --> 00:05:04,552
-What were my two men talking about?
-Mostly we talked about law schools.

59
00:05:04,752 --> 00:05:07,254
-I think he's leaning towards Duke.
-That's a good school.

60
00:05:07,488 --> 00:05:08,822
He thinks so.

61
00:05:09,022 --> 00:05:11,625
-Maybe he doesn't wanna be a lawyer.
-Nobody wants to be a lawyer.

62
00:05:11,859 --> 00:05:14,394
That's why you have to shove
that seed in early.

63
00:05:15,362 --> 00:05:19,266
-Maybe he wants to write, like dad.
-If his head doesn't flatten out...

64
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:21,334
that won't happen.

65
00:05:21,534 --> 00:05:25,037
-You don't have a flat head.
-Maybe not on the outside.

66
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:27,306
-Honey...
-What?

67
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:31,276
God gave you a gift.

68
00:05:31,877 --> 00:05:34,480
Remember what "Newsweek" said?

69
00:05:34,713 --> 00:05:38,016
"Byron Tiller's sentences
have bounce and color.

70
00:05:38,383 --> 00:05:41,085
'Hilter's Child' shows sparks
of originality...

71
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:46,524
...not often seen in thrillers."
-"In the thriller mode", he said.

72
00:05:46,758 --> 00:05:50,694
-And what about the "Times"?
-Refresh me.

73
00:05:53,898 --> 00:05:56,333
I believe he said something about
me and that Hemingway guy.

74
00:05:56,533 --> 00:05:57,534
-Yeah?
-Yes.

75
00:05:57,768 --> 00:06:00,870
-I think it slipped my mind.
-Really, it slipped your mind?

76
00:06:01,338 --> 00:06:04,307
Maybe I should refresh
your memory.

77
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:11,314
Refreshing, here I go.

78
00:06:12,815 --> 00:06:15,184
0h, my God!

79
00:06:22,057 --> 00:06:27,729
"Like Hemingway,
he carves his sentences...

80
00:06:30,131 --> 00:06:32,166
with a...

81
00:06:32,867 --> 00:06:35,502
with a diamond cutter's eye...

82
00:06:36,203 --> 00:06:39,306
Leaving the best and the brightest."

83
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,377
-God, you're good!
-I can't hear you!

84
00:06:46,346 --> 00:06:48,915
I said you're good!

85
00:06:51,217 --> 00:06:54,654
Whether his wife was talking
to Byron or God isn't certain.

86
00:06:55,154 --> 00:06:58,124
But there seemed to be more than
enough credit to go around.

87
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,759
And that's what got my attention.

88
00:07:01,593 --> 00:07:05,731
Tucked neatly between the Hollywood
porn shops, novelty shops...

89
00:07:05,964 --> 00:07:07,832
and Scientology shops...

90
00:07:08,032 --> 00:07:12,470
crammed in amongst the recording
studios whose heyday had long past...

91
00:07:12,703 --> 00:07:16,774
the unproduced screenwriters
whose deals had long lapsed...

92
00:07:17,008 --> 00:07:20,611
the bad actors teaching methods
on emoting to other bad actors...

93
00:07:20,845 --> 00:07:23,680
who dream of one day
passing an audition...

94
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,318
sat Byron Tiller, who until recently
believed writing novels...

95
00:07:28,552 --> 00:07:32,388
no one wanted to read
was a real job.

96
00:07:32,655 --> 00:07:34,891
Sell, baby, sell.

97
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:39,629
Goals have a way of becoming less
high-minded when you need money.

98
00:07:39,862 --> 00:07:42,598
-Priority.
-Yes, sir.

99
00:07:42,832 --> 00:07:44,200
Thank you.

100
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,470
The type of man perfect
for Elysian Fields.

101
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,186
-Come in.
-Thanks.

102
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:19,565
I sent it to you because
Little Brown published the last one.

103
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:25,504
So I figured: why break up
a winning combination?

104
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,774
-Biscotti?
-No, I'm okay, thanks.

105
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,977
Well, I'm sure it could use
a trim here and there...

106
00:08:32,277 --> 00:08:34,412
...but that's why you're the editor.
-All I can say is that...

107
00:08:34,646 --> 00:08:39,518
Excalibur must be great. Everyone
wanna kill each other just to get it.

108
00:08:39,718 --> 00:08:43,421
It's the sword that King Arthur
himself pulled out of the rock.

109
00:08:44,221 --> 00:08:46,190
-I know the back story.
-0f course.

110
00:08:46,424 --> 00:08:49,860
It just seems a little out of place
in a novel about migrant workers.

111
00:08:50,627 --> 00:08:54,565
Well, Excalibur
represents a symbol.

112
00:08:55,865 --> 00:08:58,034
-A symbol?
-It represents to me...

113
00:08:58,268 --> 00:09:02,438
the downtrodden's
hopes and dreams for the future.

114
00:09:02,672 --> 00:09:04,641
And the migrant workers
are simply a microcosm.

115
00:09:04,974 --> 00:09:07,410
Aren't they always?

116
00:09:07,643 --> 00:09:09,378
See...

117
00:09:09,612 --> 00:09:11,914
...that's where we have a problem.
-What is that?

118
00:09:12,114 --> 00:09:14,583
Tell you a little secret
about microcosms.

119
00:09:15,017 --> 00:09:17,719
-People hate them.
-I wasn't aware.

120
00:09:17,953 --> 00:09:20,455
Think about it.
Who'd sit on a bus...

121
00:09:20,689 --> 00:09:23,558
to read a book saying
you're part of a microcosm?

122
00:09:24,626 --> 00:09:27,928
Already knows it.
He looks around and he knows.

123
00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:33,000
Symbolism's worse. Poor bastard picks
up a book, he wants it spelled out.

124
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,270
No one wants to waste their time
looking for deeper meaning.

125
00:09:37,571 --> 00:09:40,307
My wife thinks it's
the best thing I ever wrote.

126
00:09:42,675 --> 00:09:45,212
She must love you very much.

127
00:09:49,549 --> 00:09:54,920
Look, I've always been open to
any kind of suggestions, changes...

128
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:58,157
-That wouldn't be fair to you.
-Anything.

129
00:10:00,325 --> 00:10:02,661
Maybe next time.

130
00:10:06,464 --> 00:10:08,967
-Could I get an advance?
-0n what?

131
00:10:09,434 --> 00:10:12,136
-0n the next one.
-You know I'd like to, but...

132
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:17,675
Virgil, I know that my problems
are not your problems...

133
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,380
but I got nothing left to live on.

134
00:10:24,314 --> 00:10:27,250
-Are you really that desperate?
-Yes.

135
00:10:28,484 --> 00:10:31,421
Then use that emotion.

136
00:10:32,321 --> 00:10:36,259
All of the best novels
are written in desperation.

137
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:43,298
So are the best suicide notes.

138
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,437
Why'd I think a guy in a US$ 1,400
suit'd care about migrant workers?

139
00:10:49,671 --> 00:10:54,108
So what if your editor hated your
book? You know my advice to you?

140
00:10:54,342 --> 00:10:56,177
Fuck him.

141
00:10:57,011 --> 00:11:01,415
Thanks, Harry.
That's one swell pep talk.

142
00:11:04,118 --> 00:11:05,853
Hello.

143
00:11:07,121 --> 00:11:10,190
-How are you doing?
-We haven't been introduced.

144
00:11:10,457 --> 00:11:11,624
No.

145
00:11:11,858 --> 00:11:15,128
-The name's Luther Fox.
-Byron Tiller.

146
00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:17,930
So you're a writer?

147
00:11:19,532 --> 00:11:20,699
Right.

148
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:24,670
-Anything I'd know?
-I sincerely doubt it.

149
00:11:25,204 --> 00:11:29,141
I did manage to publish a little
piece of shit called Hitler's Child.

150
00:11:29,841 --> 00:11:31,776
I liked it.

151
00:11:32,877 --> 00:11:35,246
-You read it?
-You sound surprised.

152
00:11:35,546 --> 00:11:37,715
I never actually met my public.

153
00:11:38,283 --> 00:11:41,152
Well... here I am.

154
00:11:44,088 --> 00:11:49,426
-What are you doing next?
-I'm toying with a few ideas.

155
00:11:50,427 --> 00:11:53,863
I think I'd make a very good
key punch operator.

156
00:11:54,564 --> 00:11:58,334
-Things a bit tough at the moment?
-Hemingway killed himself.

157
00:11:58,535 --> 00:12:02,972
And people actually bought his books.
Me? I'm in the fucking remainder bin.

158
00:12:03,372 --> 00:12:08,110
It's easy to think of the remainder
bin as doom on some cosmic level.

159
00:12:08,344 --> 00:12:10,713
Don't you think you're making
a mountain out of a mole hill?

160
00:12:11,146 --> 00:12:15,184
The problem is that my mountain
has shrunk into a mole hill.

161
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,452
And unless you have family...

162
00:12:19,754 --> 00:12:21,756
of moles...

163
00:12:22,456 --> 00:12:24,225
how do you live?

164
00:12:24,459 --> 00:12:28,329
A man can always support his family
if he's willing to do the necessary.

165
00:12:29,931 --> 00:12:31,398
I've got to go.

166
00:12:33,067 --> 00:12:37,470
Listen, I appreciate the drinks
and the ear.

167
00:12:37,671 --> 00:12:38,571
Thank you.

168
00:12:38,771 --> 00:12:42,942
If a key punch operator doesn't
happen for you, why don't you...

169
00:12:43,176 --> 00:12:46,579
drop by the office? Maybe we can
work something out.

170
00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:50,349
Nothing like a little life experience.

171
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,136
-Hey. What did your editor say?
-Why aren't you asleep?

172
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,905
I couldn't wait.
I had to hear what he said.

173
00:13:15,139 --> 00:13:19,276
-He saw room for changes.
-But he loved it, right?

174
00:13:20,844 --> 00:13:24,848
-Love, I don't know. It's relative.
-Relative to what?

175
00:13:25,882 --> 00:13:28,218
To whether you're
a John Grisham or not.

176
00:13:28,818 --> 00:13:31,554
Somebody like me,
they don't get too effusive.

177
00:13:34,456 --> 00:13:37,359
They are going to publish it, right?

178
00:13:40,462 --> 00:13:42,064
Yes.

179
00:13:42,297 --> 00:13:46,734
-Did he say when?
-No, that's scheduling.

180
00:13:47,502 --> 00:13:50,939
The other side of the building.
I'll find out.

181
00:13:55,176 --> 00:13:58,079
I told you it would
all work out, didn't l?

182
00:14:05,552 --> 00:14:07,420
Paul Pearson!

183
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,222
Paul Pearson!

184
00:14:09,856 --> 00:14:11,491
-I thought it was you.
-Good to see you.

185
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:14,194
-Good to see you.
-Things going well since you left us?

186
00:14:14,394 --> 00:14:17,363
Yes, great. I've just had
my first novel published.

187
00:14:17,563 --> 00:14:20,032
So I hear. Been meaning
to read it, but...

188
00:14:20,232 --> 00:14:23,335
...couldn't find it anywhere.
-Right.

189
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:26,738
-So, how's the office?
-You know advertising.

190
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:30,074
-Killing ourselves a little very day.
-I miss it.

191
00:14:30,275 --> 00:14:34,112
The action, the deadlines. There's
a hell of an adrenaline rush there.

192
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:37,882
I'd even consider getting back in
under the right circumstances.

193
00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:43,020
-You told me to go fuck myself.
-That was the adrenaline talking.

194
00:14:43,587 --> 00:14:45,622
You'd really be willing
to come back?

195
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:49,459
Salary'd be smaller,
accounts would be shit.

196
00:14:49,693 --> 00:14:53,096
-Whatever you decide.
-Well, that's a good attitude.

197
00:14:53,296 --> 00:14:57,366
-Why didn't you have it before?
-Well, I've grown up a little.

198
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,169
I'm very glad to hear it.

199
00:15:00,403 --> 00:15:02,405
Thank you.
I'll see you in the morning?

200
00:15:02,638 --> 00:15:04,473
Actually, I think it'd be better
if you just...

201
00:15:04,674 --> 00:15:06,642
go fuck yourself.

202
00:15:08,243 --> 00:15:11,313
Congratulations, Byron.
So you've come here to celebrate?

203
00:15:11,546 --> 00:15:14,015
-Where else?
-My two favorite people.

204
00:15:14,215 --> 00:15:16,384
Tell you what. I'm gonna send over
my very best bottle of wine.

205
00:15:16,618 --> 00:15:19,153
-No, Dom, that's not necessary.
-It's my gift to the author.

206
00:15:19,453 --> 00:15:21,222
That's very generous.

207
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,861
Now don't get mad, but...

208
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:30,464
I think maybe we should borrow
some money from my parents.

209
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:35,302
-Your father hates me.
-The reason he'll loan us the money.

210
00:15:35,536 --> 00:15:37,304
It'll make him feel superior.

211
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:41,908
-I won't give him the satisfaction.
-Honey, he's never satisfied.

212
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:43,375
You know that.

213
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:47,746
And once your novel gets published,
we'll pay him back. With interest.

214
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:55,553
Did you ever think that
your father was right?

215
00:15:55,787 --> 00:15:59,190
-About what?
-Maybe I am a failure.

216
00:16:04,729 --> 00:16:07,365
You just love me and figure
that everything is gonna work out.

217
00:16:07,965 --> 00:16:09,767
0f course.

218
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:17,674
Unconditional love can be
a real pain in the ass.

219
00:16:17,907 --> 00:16:20,777
Bye. Bye.

220
00:16:22,478 --> 00:16:25,348
-Love you.
-See you after work.

221
00:16:26,783 --> 00:16:29,152
What do you want
to do now, champ?

222
00:16:29,485 --> 00:16:31,954
Want to go to the park for a while?

223
00:16:34,656 --> 00:16:36,625
It's a tough fucking business.

224
00:16:36,859 --> 00:16:39,895
If you write the Goddamned Iliad who
knows if anyone's going to buy it.

225
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:44,666
Take your last book.
Nice little review on the "Times"...

226
00:16:45,533 --> 00:16:49,470
...meant nothing, right?
-In that neighborhood.

227
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:54,208
-What kind of business is that?
-Ask what Gutenberg was thinking?

228
00:16:54,876 --> 00:16:59,146
I don't give a damn what Gutenberg
was thinking. Let's cut the bullshit.

229
00:16:59,546 --> 00:17:02,148
You need money, right?

230
00:17:02,883 --> 00:17:07,153
-Just a loan.
-I've given the matter a thought...

231
00:17:08,388 --> 00:17:11,357
...and I won't lend you the money.
-Why?

232
00:17:11,557 --> 00:17:16,495
What was it Shakespeare said?
"Neither a borrower nor a lender be".

233
00:17:16,729 --> 00:17:20,432
I'm only here because I promised
your daughter I would meet you...

234
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,069
and stick my tongue up your ass.

235
00:17:24,402 --> 00:17:26,304
I guess my work here is done.

236
00:17:27,606 --> 00:17:31,509
We both know you'll never
be able to support your family.

237
00:17:31,709 --> 00:17:33,678
Think about it!

238
00:18:04,272 --> 00:18:06,842
Hi, how're you doing?

239
00:18:20,721 --> 00:18:21,989
Yeah?

240
00:18:22,223 --> 00:18:23,557
Hi.

241
00:18:24,158 --> 00:18:29,163
-Is Mr. Luther Fox around?
-This is "around". See him anywhere?

242
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:34,634
No. Will you tell him that
Byron Tiller came by to see him?

243
00:18:35,034 --> 00:18:37,303
Byron Tiller, the writer?

244
00:18:38,771 --> 00:18:41,474
-You heard of me?
-Sure.

245
00:18:41,707 --> 00:18:44,110
The other day, from Luther.

246
00:18:46,245 --> 00:18:47,979
Right.

247
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,316
My fame is spreading.

248
00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:07,965
I assumed you'd be here.

249
00:19:08,365 --> 00:19:13,270
-My receptionist told me you came by.
-She doesn't like people very much.

250
00:19:13,537 --> 00:19:15,805
I've known her for 6 years.

251
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:18,708
And the only things
I'm sure she likes...

252
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:21,444
are romance novels and raisinettes.

253
00:19:21,678 --> 00:19:27,249
-Not much of an office, is it?
-Not much an office, it's a place...

254
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,618
to pick up your messages.

255
00:19:29,852 --> 00:19:32,354
Right. Just I was thinking...

256
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:37,092
the other day you mentioned you might
have something for me, so I came by.

257
00:19:37,326 --> 00:19:41,763
-Come over and we'll talk about it.
-Sure.

258
00:19:43,565 --> 00:19:47,068
You know, the only other job
I've ever had is with an ad agency.

259
00:19:47,335 --> 00:19:52,773
They wouldn't let me back in. I've
been to many employment agencies...

260
00:19:52,973 --> 00:19:56,910
and they just keep telling me "I'm
not equipped to do anything else".

261
00:19:58,478 --> 00:20:01,314
So, what is it? What kind of
business is it that you're in?

262
00:20:02,382 --> 00:20:05,285
Elysian Fields is an escort service.

263
00:20:12,058 --> 00:20:14,193
An escort service.

264
00:20:15,794 --> 00:20:17,796
Escort service.

265
00:20:18,029 --> 00:20:19,698
So what you're
saying is you sort of...

266
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,868
you know, stand on a street corner
and put on a cowboy hat?

267
00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:26,671
No. We're not hustlers.

268
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:29,106
We tend to the wounds
of lonely women...

269
00:20:29,307 --> 00:20:32,410
in need of emotional
as well as spiritual solace.

270
00:20:33,511 --> 00:20:35,713
-Women.
-0ften is only friendship.

271
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,583
-0nly women?
-Call me old-fashioned.

272
00:20:41,551 --> 00:20:45,855
And this is the job that you
thought I would be right for?

273
00:20:46,222 --> 00:20:49,159
Well, you're handsome,
well-educated, and compassionate.

274
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:52,361
-How do you know I'm compassionate?
-I'm the one who read your novel.

275
00:20:52,728 --> 00:20:55,431
-Compassion was its best strength.
-Thank you.

276
00:20:55,998 --> 00:20:58,567
Even if the premise was shit.

277
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:06,175
If you would've read the fly leaf,
you'd have noticed I'm married...

278
00:21:06,408 --> 00:21:08,576
...and have a kid.
-All the better.

279
00:21:09,244 --> 00:21:11,846
-How is that better?
-Well, we're professionals.

280
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,451
A family at home prevents any
unnecessary entanglements...

281
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:19,120
...with the clientele.
-You have a family at home?

282
00:21:20,221 --> 00:21:22,990
I'm not that fortunate, but many
of our employees do.

283
00:21:23,223 --> 00:21:26,693
Look, I'm not trying to sit on top
of any moral high ground...

284
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:30,697
but this business you're in, doesn't
it make you a little bit ashamed?

285
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,499
No. Poverty does that.

286
00:21:34,868 --> 00:21:38,437
What I'm suggesting here, it can be
as short term as you want it to be...

287
00:21:38,671 --> 00:21:41,507
just to get you out of this
little dry patch in your life.

288
00:21:42,141 --> 00:21:44,409
Temporary.

289
00:22:15,438 --> 00:22:16,573
Hello.

290
00:22:17,607 --> 00:22:19,642
How are you?

291
00:22:20,043 --> 00:22:23,179
I was passing by.
I wanted to thank you for the...

292
00:22:23,412 --> 00:22:25,347
You thanked me last night.

293
00:22:25,781 --> 00:22:28,116
-Well, I don't remember.
-I do.

294
00:22:28,317 --> 00:22:32,788
It's not easy to be polite when
you're suicidal. I was impressed.

295
00:22:33,021 --> 00:22:34,556
I've just gotta get that...

296
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:39,361
-Again...
-No, come on in. Come in.

297
00:22:39,694 --> 00:22:42,296
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, absolutely.

298
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:50,570
I didn't know you were already
back in the country, Mrs. Hardwick.

299
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:56,677
My book says that you're gonna be
in India for another month.

300
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:01,514
Well, I know curry can do that.

301
00:23:02,782 --> 00:23:05,251
But you always look
wonderful, my dear.

302
00:23:05,852 --> 00:23:07,720
Naturally.

303
00:23:09,355 --> 00:23:12,591
I'm not sure if I can do something
on such short notice.

304
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:18,263
How much body hair do you have?

305
00:23:18,496 --> 00:23:20,699
-What?
-How much body hair do you have?

306
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:22,801
Body hair? Why?

307
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,136
The amount they pay,
they can afford to be particular.

308
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:29,307
Let me call you back
about five o'clock, okay?

309
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:33,444
I'm sure I can find you someone
by then. Bye, bye, Mrs. Hardwick.

310
00:23:34,011 --> 00:23:37,180
-She's not right for you, anyway.
-Right. Look, Luther...

311
00:23:37,414 --> 00:23:41,084
I confess I've been thinking about
what you proposed to me last night.

312
00:23:41,317 --> 00:23:43,753
-Do you play tennis?
-Badly.

313
00:23:43,954 --> 00:23:46,156
-Good, she hates to lose.
-Who's that?

314
00:23:46,389 --> 00:23:49,659
-Mrs. Franklin Buckner.
-Look...

315
00:23:49,892 --> 00:23:52,762
I was up all last night...

316
00:23:52,962 --> 00:23:57,499
Mrs. Loretta Forbes, of Encino, 46,
likes opera, the ballet...

317
00:23:57,733 --> 00:24:02,637
That's kind of what I was thinking.
Maybe like on an interim basis.

318
00:24:02,838 --> 00:24:05,373
Something like opera, tennis, ballet...

319
00:24:05,607 --> 00:24:08,376
but just no, you know?

320
00:24:11,579 --> 00:24:14,048
I just don't want the...

321
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,418
well, you know...

322
00:24:17,651 --> 00:24:20,420
the thing over there.

323
00:24:26,593 --> 00:24:28,328
Maybe this is a...

324
00:24:28,561 --> 00:24:31,864
...a very bad idea.
-An idea's only bad if doesn't work.

325
00:24:32,965 --> 00:24:37,236
Right, maybe somewhere down the line
you can find me a nice old gal...

326
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:40,205
that's looking for like
a bridge partner.

327
00:24:40,906 --> 00:24:42,708
-Byron...
-What?

328
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:45,143
I was nervous my first time too.

329
00:24:45,443 --> 00:24:49,380
That's why it's so important we find
someone you can respond to in kind.

330
00:24:49,814 --> 00:24:51,883
I mean, if we can't
provide true love...

331
00:24:52,517 --> 00:24:54,485
at least we can find symmetry.

332
00:24:55,386 --> 00:24:57,788
And your wedding ring and
your specs, they'll have to go.

333
00:24:58,256 --> 00:24:59,757
Luther...

334
00:25:01,758 --> 00:25:05,996
...I appreciate what you've done.
-Well, I haven't done anything yet.

335
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:11,267
-Maybe that's for the best.
-Andrea Allcott, 35 years old.

336
00:25:11,601 --> 00:25:15,838
Charismatic. Face of an angel.
You should have a lot in common.

337
00:25:16,305 --> 00:25:19,742
Her husband's a novelist, too.
Just like you.

338
00:25:20,376 --> 00:25:22,278
-Great.
-You may have heard of him.

339
00:25:22,478 --> 00:25:24,713
Tobias Allcott.

340
00:25:25,781 --> 00:25:28,750
Tobias Allcott,
the Pulitzer Prize winner?

341
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:31,086
Yeah, well, actually,
I think he's won three.

342
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:35,023
But Pulitzers Prizes' winner
sounds almost gluttonous.

343
00:25:36,825 --> 00:25:39,560
In college I took an entire course...

344
00:25:40,561 --> 00:25:44,265
...just specifically on his writing.
-Really? How did you do?

345
00:25:45,699 --> 00:25:47,567
B plus.

346
00:25:48,969 --> 00:25:51,205
Maybe you should bone up.

347
00:26:13,391 --> 00:26:15,560
Baby, have you seen my earrings?

348
00:26:18,463 --> 00:26:20,765
What did you do, swallow it?

349
00:26:22,433 --> 00:26:24,836
I've got a really good feeling
about this guy.

350
00:26:25,036 --> 00:26:27,972
You always had a good instinct
for this kind of thing.

351
00:26:28,639 --> 00:26:30,908
I do, don't l?

352
00:26:31,542 --> 00:26:34,211
He must be quite a prospect.

353
00:26:35,045 --> 00:26:38,314
Well, when Picasso's art teacher
saw his first doodles...

354
00:26:38,815 --> 00:26:41,384
he must've sensed
something special.

355
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:45,388
That's just how I felt
when I first met you.

356
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:49,792
Darling,
you're hopelessly romantic.

357
00:26:49,992 --> 00:26:51,560
Hopeful.

358
00:26:51,794 --> 00:26:54,029
It's a lot worse.

359
00:26:55,598 --> 00:26:57,399
It's late.

360
00:26:59,068 --> 00:27:04,105
-Let's go and do something there.
-No, George expects me.

361
00:27:04,772 --> 00:27:07,475
Let's go and celebrate.

362
00:27:08,142 --> 00:27:11,112
Don't you think
it's a trifle premature?

363
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:15,383
The best time to celebrate:
before everything turns sour.

364
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:18,018
Don't worry.

365
00:27:18,218 --> 00:27:20,187
It won't.

366
00:27:26,025 --> 00:27:28,928
-Here.
-What's this?

367
00:27:29,629 --> 00:27:31,430
It's last month's check.

368
00:27:31,664 --> 00:27:33,366
I forgot.

369
00:27:34,633 --> 00:27:36,836
So did I.

370
00:27:47,112 --> 00:27:50,381
-Are you going out?
-Didn't I tell you?

371
00:27:51,315 --> 00:27:53,785
I have a meeting with
the Little Brown publishers.

372
00:27:54,018 --> 00:27:56,154
-This late?
-Drinks and dinner.

373
00:27:56,387 --> 00:27:59,323
-Why?
-It's a bit early to talk about it.

374
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:03,393
-Not to me.
-You know I'm a little superstitious.

375
00:28:04,161 --> 00:28:05,962
No, you're not.

376
00:28:08,464 --> 00:28:10,333
About the good things I am.

377
00:28:11,734 --> 00:28:15,605
You haven't noticed because good
things haven't been coming up lately.

378
00:28:27,649 --> 00:28:30,285
They want me to meet some people
from the Book of the Month Club.

379
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:33,721
-My God, really?
-There's no guarantees.

380
00:28:33,955 --> 00:28:38,893
-No, honey, but that's great!
-They'll squeeze me to a short one.

381
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:40,661
February.

382
00:28:43,363 --> 00:28:45,832
I wish you had
something nicer to wear.

383
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:50,203
It's just dinner.
Table's gonna hide most of me.

384
00:28:50,871 --> 00:28:54,374
If they have lobster, order it. Cause
then you're covered by the bib.

385
00:29:07,719 --> 00:29:09,688
I gotta go.

386
00:29:09,921 --> 00:29:11,924
I'm gonna wanna hear everything
when you get home.

387
00:30:05,072 --> 00:30:06,807
You must be the new man.

388
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,978
Nigel Halsey.

389
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,946
Byron Tiller.

390
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,849
Yes, the writer.

391
00:30:16,082 --> 00:30:18,551
Well, the master must be impressed.

392
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:21,321
I see he took you to Dunhill.

393
00:30:22,422 --> 00:30:23,923
Let's see.

394
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:28,294
Not her again. Never tell a client
she has a nice ass. It'll never end.

395
00:30:30,563 --> 00:30:34,366
Would you like a Bulgari tonight?

396
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:37,135
No, no, you take it.

397
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:38,904
Thanks.

398
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:42,741
You ever done this kind
of work before?

399
00:30:46,111 --> 00:30:49,747
It's like rolling off a log. Just
don't roll off until they finish.

400
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:56,187
Well, Luther actually said that they
don't all necessarily want to.

401
00:30:58,422 --> 00:31:01,658
Right. Right.
You'll get used to it.

402
00:31:02,092 --> 00:31:05,061
It's when they want you to hold them
afterwards, as if it meant something.

403
00:31:05,295 --> 00:31:08,898
That's when you realize it's all
bullshit. But what business isn't?

404
00:31:09,132 --> 00:31:12,368
Could be selling used cars. At least
we give them their money's worth.

405
00:31:12,602 --> 00:31:15,938
But don't worry, Byron.
You'll be fine.

406
00:31:16,172 --> 00:31:19,408
All these rich bitches want
is some companionship...

407
00:31:20,108 --> 00:31:22,344
and sex.

408
00:31:22,611 --> 00:31:25,380
We're like cocker spaniels
with hard-ons.

409
00:31:27,949 --> 00:31:31,619
-I'll keep that image in mind.
-Good.

410
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:51,938
Hello?

411
00:31:52,171 --> 00:31:54,374
Hi. It's me.

412
00:31:54,674 --> 00:31:56,175
Is anything wrong?

413
00:31:56,909 --> 00:31:59,011
No. I just...

414
00:32:00,579 --> 00:32:03,582
got one of those urges to tell you
that I love you.

415
00:32:03,915 --> 00:32:06,118
And I love you.

416
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:09,888
-Why?
-You know why.

417
00:32:13,524 --> 00:32:15,760
I need to hear it.

418
00:32:16,227 --> 00:32:18,062
Because...

419
00:32:18,296 --> 00:32:20,731
you're smart and funny...

420
00:32:21,098 --> 00:32:23,901
...and thoughtful.
-Dena...

421
00:32:25,803 --> 00:32:27,738
I don't...

422
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:33,176
...I don't feel any of those things.
-Byron, you're just nervous.

423
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:36,479
But it's okay, you know why?

424
00:32:37,046 --> 00:32:38,114
Why?

425
00:32:38,514 --> 00:32:43,185
'Cause I'll be right here,
believing in you. 0kay?

426
00:32:46,655 --> 00:32:48,423
0kay.

427
00:32:57,532 --> 00:33:00,101
Everyone is nervous the first time.

428
00:33:00,334 --> 00:33:03,504
It was important for Byron
to meet someone beautiful.

429
00:33:03,738 --> 00:33:07,274
Someone like Andrea Allcott,
who, indeed...

430
00:33:07,508 --> 00:33:11,812
had the face of an angel.
And it wasn't just her face.

431
00:33:12,046 --> 00:33:15,916
Plastic surgeons make money to buy
yachts for rearranging nature...

432
00:33:16,116 --> 00:33:20,520
in a more pleasing way. No, this
wasn't just a run-of-the-mill angel.

433
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,555
This one, I'm sure...

434
00:33:22,789 --> 00:33:25,358
God handled himself.

435
00:33:31,363 --> 00:33:33,432
You must be the man
from Elysian Fields.

436
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:40,505
Yes.

437
00:34:00,256 --> 00:34:04,661
I hate to go to these alone. I'd have
got out of it, but it's for charity.

438
00:34:06,796 --> 00:34:10,632
Let's hope they find a cure for
whatever it is... quick.

439
00:34:32,186 --> 00:34:34,588
So, what would you like to do now?

440
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:38,492
-Are you hungry?
-Not really.

441
00:34:39,426 --> 00:34:43,930
-Actually, a biscotti would be nice.
-A biscotti. 0f course.

442
00:34:44,164 --> 00:34:46,233
-0ne biscotti, please.
-Sure.

443
00:34:47,733 --> 00:34:49,735
-How much?
-Two dollars.

444
00:34:50,803 --> 00:34:53,105
Listen, may I get a receipt?

445
00:34:55,908 --> 00:34:57,977
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

446
00:34:59,578 --> 00:35:02,681
You don't have to thank me.
It's a business expense.

447
00:35:05,183 --> 00:35:09,120
Which brings up a question
I'm not sure I should ask.

448
00:35:10,121 --> 00:35:14,425
Asking is your prerogative.
Not answering is mine.

449
00:35:16,861 --> 00:35:21,065
Why didn't you consider bringing
a friend this evening?

450
00:35:24,768 --> 00:35:26,703
Right.

451
00:35:26,937 --> 00:35:30,640
Why would someone like you
need someone like me?

452
00:35:30,873 --> 00:35:33,943
There are some occasions to which
a woman should have an escort.

453
00:35:34,177 --> 00:35:36,111
Yes, but...

454
00:35:36,445 --> 00:35:40,249
I would figure that it would be very
easy for you to find a real one.

455
00:35:40,482 --> 00:35:42,551
Aren't you a real one?

456
00:35:42,818 --> 00:35:46,988
I mean someone you wouldn't
have to arrange.

457
00:35:50,158 --> 00:35:52,160
I'm married.

458
00:35:53,295 --> 00:35:55,530
That's not always
a stumbling block.

459
00:35:56,765 --> 00:35:59,366
I love my husband dearly.

460
00:36:00,601 --> 00:36:03,104
That's very nice.

461
00:36:03,904 --> 00:36:06,373
We think so.

462
00:36:07,274 --> 00:36:09,910
Will you be all right in a taxi?

463
00:36:14,081 --> 00:36:16,349
Good night, Mr. Tiller.

464
00:36:22,355 --> 00:36:24,924
Good night.

465
00:36:44,942 --> 00:36:47,644
If you could mail the check
immediately, Mrs. Randolph...

466
00:36:47,912 --> 00:36:49,847
I'd really appreciate it.

467
00:36:51,615 --> 00:36:53,417
Thank you, good bye.

468
00:36:54,584 --> 00:36:56,520
I don't know why they call them
outstanding checks.

469
00:36:56,753 --> 00:37:00,223
-As if not being paid is a good thing.
-I saw you last night.

470
00:37:00,457 --> 00:37:02,258
-Where?
-At the concert.

471
00:37:05,261 --> 00:37:07,229
She's very attractive.

472
00:37:07,463 --> 00:37:09,932
You mean Jennifer Adler,
she's been a client for years.

473
00:37:10,198 --> 00:37:13,536
In fact, she's the only client
I still handle personally.

474
00:37:14,002 --> 00:37:17,072
If it hadn't been for her, I probably
would've retired years ago.

475
00:37:17,306 --> 00:37:21,309
Well, I think I'll be retiring now.

476
00:37:22,043 --> 00:37:23,277
What, already?

477
00:37:23,711 --> 00:37:27,815
Yeah, I'm not sure that I'm really
cut out for this sort of thing.

478
00:37:28,315 --> 00:37:31,052
Byron, are you doubting
my instincts?

479
00:37:32,786 --> 00:37:35,822
Well, then I hope you like
experimental theatre.

480
00:37:55,307 --> 00:37:58,110
I hate coming to these things alone.

481
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:03,582
-I'd have gotten out of it...
-Let me guess...

482
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:06,017
it's for charity.

483
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:15,526
I used to have one of those
on my dashboard.

484
00:38:20,764 --> 00:38:22,532
So...

485
00:38:27,337 --> 00:38:30,206
how about a biscotti?

486
00:38:42,384 --> 00:38:44,853
You want me to get in this time?

487
00:38:45,054 --> 00:38:47,322
If you like.

488
00:38:47,989 --> 00:38:49,691
If I don't, will the check bounce?

489
00:38:51,793 --> 00:38:53,027
It might.

490
00:38:53,261 --> 00:38:55,496
-Where to then, ma'am?
-Pasadena.

491
00:39:13,779 --> 00:39:17,016
-Would you like one?
-No, thank you.

492
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,791
-So, do you go out often?
-Not often.

493
00:39:26,358 --> 00:39:30,295
Most of my friends are my husband's,
and most of his friends are dead.

494
00:39:48,412 --> 00:39:50,414
Would you like me
to see you to the door?

495
00:39:51,515 --> 00:39:53,483
That'd be polite.

496
00:40:00,756 --> 00:40:02,758
-Thank you, Phillip.
-Good night, ma'am.

497
00:40:02,992 --> 00:40:04,994
Thank you.

498
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:07,930
Do you like hot cocoa?

499
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:13,435
-Do you make it with milk or water?
-Milk, of course.

500
00:40:15,503 --> 00:40:18,473
What would you have done
if I'd said water?

501
00:40:18,907 --> 00:40:21,542
Prayed for marshmallows.

502
00:40:27,448 --> 00:40:28,882
It's delicious.

503
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:33,153
I wasn't sure how much milk.
I usually don't make any one.

504
00:40:33,587 --> 00:40:36,089
Doesn't your husband
like hot cocoa?

505
00:40:38,191 --> 00:40:40,860
He has diabetes.

506
00:40:41,795 --> 00:40:46,165
You seem so very young
to be married to someone like him.

507
00:40:49,935 --> 00:40:52,404
It didn't matter at first...

508
00:40:53,439 --> 00:40:56,208
but in the last couple of years,
you know...

509
00:40:56,775 --> 00:40:59,944
I'm sure it's very tough on him,
being a writer.

510
00:41:00,645 --> 00:41:04,950
-What would you know about that?
-I'm sort of a writer myself.

511
00:41:07,251 --> 00:41:08,719
Really?

512
00:41:08,986 --> 00:41:10,321
Yes, really.

513
00:41:10,921 --> 00:41:12,990
Are you surprised?

514
00:41:13,224 --> 00:41:14,958
Actually, no.

515
00:41:16,493 --> 00:41:20,530
You're not the sort of man who'd be
satisfied taking lonely women around.

516
00:41:21,297 --> 00:41:22,999
0h, so you are lonely.

517
00:41:23,433 --> 00:41:28,004
There's nothing lonelier than
watching the man you love slowly die.

518
00:41:32,208 --> 00:41:34,843
"Death. The only immortal...

519
00:41:35,778 --> 00:41:40,682
who treats us all alike, whose pity
and whose peace and whose refuge...

520
00:41:41,216 --> 00:41:43,651
are for all."

521
00:41:45,187 --> 00:41:48,289
-Very beautiful.
-Mark Twain.

522
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,327
The reality is less poetic.

523
00:41:59,733 --> 00:42:02,169
Sorry.

524
00:42:45,475 --> 00:42:48,478
Hello, darling. What are you
doing up so late?

525
00:42:48,879 --> 00:42:51,448
I forgot to take my insulin shot.
I just went down to get it.

526
00:42:51,681 --> 00:42:53,583
But you feel okay?

527
00:42:54,551 --> 00:42:56,452
Yeah, I'm all right.

528
00:42:59,755 --> 00:43:02,925
0h, darling, I'd like you
to meet Byron Tiller.

529
00:43:05,394 --> 00:43:07,362
Byron?

530
00:43:16,004 --> 00:43:17,772
0h, hello.

531
00:43:19,674 --> 00:43:21,408
Hello, sir.

532
00:43:21,642 --> 00:43:23,945
-Byron's a writer, too.
-Is that a fact?

533
00:43:26,546 --> 00:43:29,916
Yes, I write a little bit.
Certainly not in your league.

534
00:43:30,317 --> 00:43:33,453
Well, at least that's comforting.

535
00:43:34,254 --> 00:43:37,090
-Would you like some food?
-No, thanks, darling.

536
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:39,559
You just continue on
with what you're doing.

537
00:43:42,862 --> 00:43:48,434
-It's an honor to meet you, sir.
-I'd say "the pleasure's all mine"...

538
00:43:49,134 --> 00:43:52,170
but that would be foolish,
wouldn't it?

539
00:43:54,939 --> 00:43:57,008
Good night.

540
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,248
Shit!

541
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:57,731
Byron Tiller...

542
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,768
you're simply inspiring.

543
00:45:18,017 --> 00:45:20,552
-Morning.
-Good morning.

544
00:45:21,854 --> 00:45:24,222
Did you sleep well?

545
00:45:24,556 --> 00:45:26,257
Not a wink.

546
00:45:26,491 --> 00:45:29,694
Neither did I. Seems we're
a couple of insomniacs.

547
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:33,297
Well, Lottie got me going
with some strong coffee.

548
00:45:33,531 --> 00:45:36,601
Lottie, you shouldn't give him
a mug! He's not a tradesman.

549
00:45:38,102 --> 00:45:40,571
0h, thank you, no.
I'm not hungry. Thank you.

550
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:42,740
It's not for you!

551
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:50,113
Mr. Allcott wants you to bring
him his breakfast.

552
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:52,782
Me? Why?

553
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:57,053
Well, it'll come up
in conversation.

554
00:46:20,408 --> 00:46:21,475
Come in.

555
00:46:21,709 --> 00:46:24,945
-Come in!
-I heard you typing, but...

556
00:46:25,179 --> 00:46:29,750
I didn't want to disturb you at work.
Your breakfast is getting cold.

557
00:46:30,217 --> 00:46:33,720
Well, it doesn't make any difference,
anyway. I'm not allowed to eat it.

558
00:46:35,521 --> 00:46:38,424
A soft-boiled egg is all I get.

559
00:46:38,624 --> 00:46:42,195
And the rest of it's just for show
so I don't feel deprived.

560
00:46:42,862 --> 00:46:47,333
-It ends up in the dog's tray later.
-Yes, sir. Enjoy.

561
00:46:47,566 --> 00:46:49,167
Did you have a good time last night?

562
00:46:51,203 --> 00:46:55,640
It's quite all right.
She has my blessing.

563
00:46:56,474 --> 00:47:00,144
A man should make sure
his wife is taken care of.

564
00:47:01,379 --> 00:47:03,681
Any way he can.
Don't you agree?

565
00:47:03,914 --> 00:47:06,884
-Yes, very much, sir.
-Perhaps it was a mistake...

566
00:47:07,118 --> 00:47:09,386
marrying a woman
much younger than me, but...

567
00:47:09,887 --> 00:47:13,156
I was very robust until
just a few years ago.

568
00:47:13,623 --> 00:47:17,860
-I've heard all the stories, sir.
-0nly believe the outrageous ones.

569
00:47:18,228 --> 00:47:23,366
I was blessed to live a life
without boundaries.

570
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,468
In the end...

571
00:47:27,936 --> 00:47:30,038
only God gets to do that.

572
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:34,910
Genius should be afforded privileges
not handed out to ordinary men.

573
00:47:36,077 --> 00:47:38,847
-You think I'm a genius?
-Yes, sir, I do.

574
00:47:40,882 --> 00:47:43,117
Well, you're probably right.

575
00:47:44,552 --> 00:47:46,721
But even that...

576
00:47:46,954 --> 00:47:51,792
becomes more difficult with time.
You know, when I was your age...

577
00:47:52,026 --> 00:47:54,728
ideas used to flow out of me.

578
00:47:56,396 --> 00:48:02,636
Now I have to squeeze them like farts
before I can string them together.

579
00:48:03,603 --> 00:48:06,172
-You're probably just in a slump.
-Slump?

580
00:48:06,406 --> 00:48:11,710
A slump happens in the middle
of your life, not at the end of it.

581
00:48:12,277 --> 00:48:17,149
-But you're working now.
-It took me 12 years to write that.

582
00:48:17,515 --> 00:48:19,818
I was just going through,
tidying it up a bit...

583
00:48:20,052 --> 00:48:22,754
killing all the
unnecessary adjectives.

584
00:48:23,221 --> 00:48:27,191
-I can't wait for it to be published.
-Yes, I...

585
00:48:28,226 --> 00:48:30,961
don't think I'll be able
to wait either.

586
00:48:32,196 --> 00:48:36,467
All my organs turned against me.
These little bastards!

587
00:48:41,872 --> 00:48:44,040
Would you like to read it?

588
00:48:47,043 --> 00:48:50,246
-Really?
-You're a writer.

589
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,050
I'd like another
professional's opinion.

590
00:49:03,058 --> 00:49:05,693
-My wife thinks it's wonderful.
-Yes.

591
00:49:05,927 --> 00:49:11,032
But she is my wife, and you can
never trust a value system...

592
00:49:12,066 --> 00:49:14,769
where true love is involved.

593
00:49:20,408 --> 00:49:22,877
-What are you doing?
-Reading.

594
00:49:23,744 --> 00:49:27,881
My editor gave me the latest
manuscript from Tobias Allcott.

595
00:49:28,115 --> 00:49:30,784
-Is it any good?
-None of it is any good.

596
00:49:31,017 --> 00:49:33,253
Then put it down
and pay attention to me!

597
00:49:33,486 --> 00:49:36,122
It's about time a man spent time
with his wife instead of his editor.

598
00:49:37,957 --> 00:49:39,725
You ready?

599
00:49:39,959 --> 00:49:41,226
Yeah...

600
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:53,971
-What do you think?
-Very nice.

601
00:49:55,206 --> 00:49:59,510
I spent a lot, but you need a suit
now that you're an important author.

602
00:49:59,744 --> 00:50:02,012
-Where did you get the money?
-Daddy sent us US$ 1,000.

603
00:50:02,246 --> 00:50:04,815
-Won't give more until you apologize.
-I'm not gonna apologize.

604
00:50:05,048 --> 00:50:09,086
I told him it'd be a cold day in hell
until you did. Give him some time.

605
00:50:09,486 --> 00:50:13,323
Now it says right...

606
00:50:14,491 --> 00:50:19,262
here that it's made out
of 80% of the good stuff.

607
00:50:19,529 --> 00:50:22,131
-Right.
-And only 20% of the cheaper fabric.

608
00:50:22,364 --> 00:50:24,600
So you don't even notice.
And...

609
00:50:25,568 --> 00:50:27,502
I had them put extra room
on the crotch.

610
00:50:32,073 --> 00:50:34,009
Do you like it?

611
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:36,578
0h, yes. I love it.

612
00:50:37,712 --> 00:50:41,983
I told the salesman that it was for
a very important novelist...

613
00:50:42,449 --> 00:50:44,552
that the Book of the Month Club
was after.

614
00:50:44,786 --> 00:50:46,854
Dena, I told you...

615
00:50:47,855 --> 00:50:51,825
that...
it's still in the talking stages.

616
00:50:53,126 --> 00:50:56,563
-I'm sending out positive vibrations.
-I can see that.

617
00:51:04,437 --> 00:51:06,639
Make love to me.

618
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:28,859
Tobias brought me here
on our first date.

619
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,095
How did you meet him?

620
00:51:31,328 --> 00:51:34,765
I went to interview him at the
house, and I never left.

621
00:51:35,165 --> 00:51:37,567
Must've been one
hell of an interview.

622
00:51:38,635 --> 00:51:41,772
Tobias likes to have youth around
him. Says it keeps him young.

623
00:51:43,773 --> 00:51:45,608
What were you gonna say?

624
00:51:47,243 --> 00:51:49,979
It doesn't seem
to be working anymore.

625
00:51:54,517 --> 00:51:58,520
His eyes are still young
when he looks at me.

626
00:52:02,724 --> 00:52:05,760
I guess that's all that matters.

627
00:52:15,403 --> 00:52:17,938
My husband says he's given you
a copy of the novel to read.

628
00:52:19,506 --> 00:52:22,743
He doesn't usually do that.
He must think very highly of you.

629
00:52:23,843 --> 00:52:25,412
He doesn't even know me.

630
00:52:26,012 --> 00:52:28,081
What did you think?

631
00:52:29,749 --> 00:52:33,953
-It's wonderful, right?
-The best thing he's ever written.

632
00:52:35,721 --> 00:52:37,957
-Piece of shit, isn't it?
-Yes.

633
00:52:39,625 --> 00:52:41,293
Will you do something for me?

634
00:52:42,394 --> 00:52:44,262
Tell him.

635
00:52:45,263 --> 00:52:47,966
-Tell him what?
-Tell him that it's no good.

636
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:51,302
-I can't do that.
-Well, then the critics will.

637
00:52:51,803 --> 00:52:56,307
And it'll kill him. The only thing
he has left is his reputation.

638
00:52:57,107 --> 00:52:59,443
And when he dies,
I want him holding onto it.

639
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:02,780
-I don't know.
-Please, Byron.

640
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:16,091
Mind if I sit down?

641
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,763
Mind if I don't stand up?

642
00:53:22,064 --> 00:53:23,999
Nice ducks.

643
00:53:29,337 --> 00:53:31,473
I think we're just...

644
00:53:31,739 --> 00:53:33,608
contributing to...

645
00:53:34,375 --> 00:53:37,111
their lackadaisical attitude.

646
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:41,449
Most people would like to come
back as a bird in their next life.

647
00:53:41,649 --> 00:53:45,419
They don't know what they're talking
about. It's a miserable existence.

648
00:53:45,653 --> 00:53:48,388
I mean, living on handouts...

649
00:53:48,889 --> 00:53:51,624
and leftovers, for God's sake.

650
00:53:52,259 --> 00:53:57,830
-I guess flying represents freedom.
-Birds don't know that.

651
00:53:58,198 --> 00:54:00,566
Flying to them is work.

652
00:54:01,901 --> 00:54:06,038
Unless, of course,
you're an eagle or a hawk.

653
00:54:07,339 --> 00:54:10,342
Soaring. Soaring, though.
Soaring could be pleasurable.

654
00:54:15,947 --> 00:54:19,084
-What would you like to come back as?
-I wouldn't.

655
00:54:19,384 --> 00:54:23,087
I'll never have it better
than I did in this lifetime.

656
00:54:23,888 --> 00:54:25,556
Never.

657
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:28,892
-Most people can't say that.
-Yeah, well...

658
00:54:29,226 --> 00:54:32,095
doesn't make it
any easier leaving it.

659
00:54:34,931 --> 00:54:36,533
We'll feed the ducks.

660
00:54:38,201 --> 00:54:44,039
When I was working, I could still
feel that calling, you know?

661
00:54:45,441 --> 00:54:48,110
And now that the book is finished...

662
00:54:49,478 --> 00:54:53,682
I just can't find a reason
for me any longer.

663
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:01,556
Did you read it?

664
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:04,693
Yes, I did.

665
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,129
And?

666
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:12,132
It's wonderful.

667
00:55:17,804 --> 00:55:20,507
For a first draft.

668
00:55:22,842 --> 00:55:27,680
0h, Goddamned! Jesus Christ!

669
00:55:28,915 --> 00:55:32,952
-Can't you take a little criticism?
-What do you mean, "a first draft"?

670
00:55:33,286 --> 00:55:37,055
-What didn't you like about it?
-Can we just talk about this later?

671
00:55:38,324 --> 00:55:40,125
It stinks, okay?

672
00:55:40,358 --> 00:55:42,827
It stinks? It stinks?

673
00:55:44,563 --> 00:55:45,830
The whole thing?

674
00:55:46,064 --> 00:55:50,434
I can't get too specific at the moment.
I've got other things on my mind.

675
00:55:50,935 --> 00:55:54,271
Jesus Christ.
Might have broken my nose.

676
00:55:54,505 --> 00:55:56,073
Well, show me.

677
00:55:58,475 --> 00:56:00,243
Show me!

678
00:56:02,346 --> 00:56:04,815
Not your nose!

679
00:56:05,448 --> 00:56:07,017
Come on!

680
00:56:07,384 --> 00:56:11,054
All right, you just show me what's
wrong with what I've written.

681
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:14,323
-I don't want to bleed on it.
-My blood is on every page.

682
00:56:14,557 --> 00:56:16,726
Now goddamn it, you tell me
what's wrong with it.

683
00:56:16,959 --> 00:56:19,928
-You know why you're a great writer?
-I thought we agreed it was genius.

684
00:56:20,129 --> 00:56:23,632
That helps. But it's the characters
that you actually write about.

685
00:56:23,865 --> 00:56:27,002
They are so real that the reader
actually feels their flesh.

686
00:56:27,235 --> 00:56:29,637
-Thank you.
-Yes, but this is 800 pages...

687
00:56:29,871 --> 00:56:32,440
on the fall of the Roman Empire,
for God's sakes!

688
00:56:32,673 --> 00:56:34,209
-It's well researched.
-Who cares?

689
00:56:34,942 --> 00:56:37,945
Goddamned! Who the fuck are you
to criticize my work?

690
00:56:38,179 --> 00:56:39,647
-I am nobody.
-Yes. Exactly.

691
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,849
But a nobody can still be right.

692
00:56:50,924 --> 00:56:53,626
Wait a second.
Are you supposed to be drinking?

693
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:58,931
No, I'm not. My doctor says it'll
kill me. Let's hope he's right.

694
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:02,101
Look, I'm not saying that what
you have here is not great.

695
00:57:02,802 --> 00:57:06,839
-What are you saying it, then?
-You might've taken a wrong approach.

696
00:57:07,339 --> 00:57:10,275
What is the main theme you actually
wanted to write the book about?

697
00:57:10,475 --> 00:57:14,679
That every social structure makes
slaves out of one group or another.

698
00:57:14,912 --> 00:57:17,449
-That's terrific!
-Thank you for your approval.

699
00:57:17,681 --> 00:57:20,351
So what do you need
Roman slaves for?

700
00:57:20,584 --> 00:57:24,421
-What's wrong with them?
-Nobody can identify with them.

701
00:57:24,655 --> 00:57:28,858
0h, are you telling me that I've
just wasted 12 years of my life?

702
00:57:29,092 --> 00:57:30,127
-No!
-What, then?

703
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:34,997
Prove that with another oppressed
group. There's enough to pick from.

704
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:38,501
This could be the greatest novel
that you ever wrote.

705
00:57:38,835 --> 00:57:40,503
I already thought it was.

706
00:57:40,736 --> 00:57:45,741
You just gotta get rid of the Roman
slaves and find yourself another...

707
00:57:45,974 --> 00:57:47,643
microcosm.

708
00:57:50,145 --> 00:57:51,413
Blacks?

709
00:57:53,315 --> 00:57:54,782
Jews?

710
00:57:56,918 --> 00:57:58,453
Homosexuals?

711
00:57:59,954 --> 00:58:01,822
Who, then?

712
00:58:04,592 --> 00:58:06,960
Migrant workers.

713
00:58:09,063 --> 00:58:11,565
Migrant workers.

714
00:58:33,852 --> 00:58:35,954
Migrant workers?

715
00:58:36,989 --> 00:58:39,324
Son of a bitch!

716
00:58:50,668 --> 00:58:52,703
When did you get contacts?

717
00:58:54,037 --> 00:58:56,306
The editor said that...

718
00:58:56,874 --> 00:59:02,145
the glasses, they're probably what
hurt the sales of Hitler's Child.

719
00:59:02,545 --> 00:59:05,148
I thought he said that
about the goatee.

720
00:59:06,115 --> 00:59:11,787
He sprung for the contacts because
glasses make me look intellectual...

721
00:59:11,988 --> 00:59:15,424
and scare people off. Nobody wants
to read a book and look up a word...

722
00:59:15,624 --> 00:59:18,060
Why don't you just take a picture
without the glasses on?

723
00:59:21,997 --> 00:59:25,667
I guess maybe the public appearances.
I know you like them. If you want...

724
00:59:25,867 --> 00:59:29,670
Not really. I just liked you
with all your defects.

725
01:00:12,277 --> 01:00:14,212
You wanted to see me?

726
01:00:17,081 --> 01:00:19,250
You know when I was here last?

727
01:00:20,417 --> 01:00:21,718
No.

728
01:00:21,919 --> 01:00:24,521
Neither do I.
Beautiful, isn't it?

729
01:00:28,658 --> 01:00:31,694
Makes you feel
as if anything's possible.

730
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:35,865
You know,
I was a bit of a child prodigy.

731
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:40,136
-Played Mozart by the time I was 7.
-Really?

732
01:00:40,703 --> 01:00:46,141
Not the same as being Mozart, but
it's not bad for a start, isn't so?

733
01:00:47,309 --> 01:00:49,244
What happened?

734
01:00:50,045 --> 01:00:51,880
I grew up.

735
01:00:52,981 --> 01:00:55,383
Wolfgang never stood a chance.

736
01:00:56,217 --> 01:00:59,420
I'm finding that regrets
don't do a person much good.

737
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:02,423
You know, Byron,
this is a tricky business.

738
01:01:03,624 --> 01:01:06,660
You're very lucky to have
a wife and family.

739
01:01:07,894 --> 01:01:10,731
Don't let their love slip
through your fingers.

740
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:18,971
Do you know why
I brought you here?

741
01:01:20,072 --> 01:01:21,674
No, my darling, why?

742
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:26,712
This is where I took you
on our first date.

743
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:31,683
-No, it isn't.
-Well, the location is the same.

744
01:01:31,884 --> 01:01:34,486
They tore the restaurant down.

745
01:01:34,686 --> 01:01:38,256
LA is a tough place
to be romantic in.

746
01:01:38,456 --> 01:01:40,692
You do all right.

747
01:01:42,827 --> 01:01:47,164
You remember that new guy
I was telling you about?

748
01:01:48,665 --> 01:01:53,103
I cut a deal for him that'll bring in
more money than I've seen in years.

749
01:01:53,637 --> 01:01:55,372
That's wonderful, darling!

750
01:01:57,474 --> 01:02:01,878
-And I've been thinking...
-I love when you think. It's so sexy.

751
01:02:04,347 --> 01:02:10,119
Not using success to enrich your life
is to put failure into Gucci shoes.

752
01:02:12,821 --> 01:02:16,458
-I don't know what you mean. Thanks.
-No, let me get this one.

753
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:22,397
Thank you.

754
01:02:25,766 --> 01:02:26,968
Here.

755
01:02:29,036 --> 01:02:30,772
What's this?

756
01:02:42,716 --> 01:02:44,918
It's the check I made out
to you last month.

757
01:02:46,519 --> 01:02:47,920
I don't want it.

758
01:02:49,422 --> 01:02:53,092
You're the only woman, in 30 years,
I felt I could be myself with.

759
01:02:54,293 --> 01:02:56,862
I don't want your money anymore.

760
01:02:57,797 --> 01:02:59,231
I just want you.

761
01:03:00,166 --> 01:03:02,367
I don't understand.

762
01:03:03,168 --> 01:03:04,970
I want you to leave your husband.

763
01:03:07,873 --> 01:03:09,641
I want to marry you.

764
01:03:18,916 --> 01:03:21,551
You must be out of your mind.

765
01:03:21,751 --> 01:03:24,388
Why the hell would I do that?

766
01:03:26,823 --> 01:03:28,759
Here, take this back!

767
01:03:33,696 --> 01:03:37,700
What the hell are you thinking
about? Come on, let's go.

768
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,036
You're silly.

769
01:03:41,770 --> 01:03:43,906
That was a good one!

770
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:49,611
Very nice. This is wonderful.
You eat like this every night?

771
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,314
Thank you.

772
01:03:54,315 --> 01:03:57,318
Not every night.
Tonight's a celebration.

773
01:03:58,752 --> 01:04:00,688
Welcome to the family.

774
01:04:07,761 --> 01:04:13,233
And I must say, it was a most
generous offer. I thank you.

775
01:04:14,067 --> 01:04:17,003
Well, I don't know
how much time I have left.

776
01:04:18,004 --> 01:04:22,641
But I wanna spend it seeing
my beautiful wife happy.

777
01:04:26,778 --> 01:04:30,582
-I'll certainly do whatever I can.
-No. You'll do whatever she wants.

778
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:33,718
Right.

779
01:04:40,491 --> 01:04:43,127
-Darling, you should tell him.
-Yes, darling.

780
01:04:44,895 --> 01:04:46,630
So Byron...

781
01:04:47,364 --> 01:04:49,399
I'm going to need
your help, too.

782
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,268
-0kay.
-With my book.

783
01:04:51,735 --> 01:04:54,971
-Any suggestions I can offer...
-No, I don't want any suggestions.

784
01:04:55,171 --> 01:04:58,441
They'll only annoy me.
I want you to help me to rewrite it.

785
01:05:04,314 --> 01:05:06,148
Yeah, okay.

786
01:05:11,286 --> 01:05:15,791
-You mean, like... together?
-You won't be sitting on my lap.

787
01:05:16,324 --> 01:05:19,694
No. I like your ideas.
Andrea seems to...

788
01:05:20,595 --> 01:05:24,199
trust you. And Luther says
that you're a Yale man.

789
01:05:24,565 --> 01:05:27,034
Well, you can't be all bad.

790
01:05:28,069 --> 01:05:30,070
30 percent of the royalties.

791
01:05:30,270 --> 01:05:32,773
-Co-authorship.
-Co-authorship?

792
01:05:34,808 --> 01:05:37,678
My name next to...

793
01:05:39,713 --> 01:05:43,816
...next to your name?
-Possibly in the same letter case.

794
01:05:50,456 --> 01:05:53,793
-Byron, what are we doing here?
-Acclimating.

795
01:05:54,193 --> 01:05:58,630
Acclimating. We're even gonna have
your father over for dinner.

796
01:05:58,831 --> 01:06:01,032
-Follow me.
-This is crazy.

797
01:06:03,401 --> 01:06:04,702
How can we afford this?

798
01:06:05,603 --> 01:06:09,640
Tobias Allcott wants
to write with me.

799
01:06:10,374 --> 01:06:12,176
With me.

800
01:06:12,743 --> 01:06:14,545
Dance with me.

801
01:06:57,451 --> 01:07:01,555
Let's put him in a zoot suit.

802
01:08:03,212 --> 01:08:04,613
Hello, Byron.

803
01:08:04,813 --> 01:08:07,950
I was out last night with a woman
who had me sucking on her toes.

804
01:08:08,684 --> 01:08:12,053
-Does this look normal to you?
-Cold sore.

805
01:08:13,221 --> 01:08:17,525
There should be places on a person
where they don't want company.

806
01:08:32,172 --> 01:08:33,974
Guess what new words Nathaniel
learned today?

807
01:08:34,841 --> 01:08:38,311
-What?
-What the hell happened to my daddy?

808
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:43,582
-That's not funny.
-It wasn't meant to be.

809
01:08:44,783 --> 01:08:47,720
-I just need to finish this chapter.
-You can do it tomorrow.

810
01:08:48,354 --> 01:08:52,258
-You gotta spend some time with us.
-Dena, I need a few minutes.

811
01:08:52,458 --> 01:08:55,460
-Byron, please.
-Don't you understand what I'm doing?

812
01:08:56,194 --> 01:08:58,297
-Believe me, I've been trying.
-I just need some time.

813
01:08:58,497 --> 01:09:02,100
-This is our big break!
-We were fine with the little breaks!

814
01:09:07,538 --> 01:09:09,807
Do you think that I enjoy
having to do it this way?

815
01:09:12,343 --> 01:09:17,147
How many chances happen in
a lifetime? lf there is one, grab it.

816
01:09:17,347 --> 01:09:20,984
Even if you hate
everything that comes with it!

817
01:09:21,184 --> 01:09:24,053
And I hate this! I hate it!

818
01:09:24,554 --> 01:09:28,291
But I'm doing it for you!
I'm doing it for Nathaniel!

819
01:09:51,412 --> 01:09:52,846
Who is it?

820
01:09:53,047 --> 01:09:55,082
0nly me.

821
01:09:55,849 --> 01:10:00,453
-Thanks, darling. They're beautiful.
-Are you feeling okay?

822
01:10:00,854 --> 01:10:02,822
Tired.

823
01:10:03,190 --> 01:10:05,759
You need to get some sleep.

824
01:10:05,959 --> 01:10:10,597
I'm only tired when my eyes are open.
When they're closed, I just feel...

825
01:10:10,797 --> 01:10:12,599
scared.

826
01:10:13,933 --> 01:10:15,468
Where are you going?

827
01:10:15,668 --> 01:10:20,138
-I'm going to the office to see...
-No, you can work later.

828
01:10:20,873 --> 01:10:24,008
That's the problem.
I can't work.

829
01:10:26,277 --> 01:10:32,516
When I think, it's like walking
into an empty room.

830
01:10:34,018 --> 01:10:36,754
If there's anything good
filling the pages...

831
01:10:38,222 --> 01:10:41,124
...it's because of him.
-Don't talk like that.

832
01:10:42,259 --> 01:10:47,931
They say the saddest thing
is to outlive your children.

833
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:52,535
My talent was my child.

834
01:10:54,970 --> 01:10:57,407
You're weary.

835
01:10:58,574 --> 01:11:02,645
You have no respect
for the truth. None.

836
01:11:06,882 --> 01:11:10,485
It's what I love most about you.

837
01:11:52,190 --> 01:11:54,459
Well done. Well done.

838
01:11:57,995 --> 01:12:00,432
I haven't heard any laughing.

839
01:12:00,965 --> 01:12:04,202
What's wrong with her? There's
some funny stuff in there.

840
01:12:05,436 --> 01:12:07,504
Yeah, well...

841
01:12:07,938 --> 01:12:11,775
she seldom laughs out loud
when she's reading.

842
01:12:14,110 --> 01:12:18,448
It's her only imperfection.

843
01:12:21,184 --> 01:12:25,054
You know, Andrea is
the only one of them...

844
01:12:25,688 --> 01:12:30,126
who I believe
ever loved me completely.

845
01:12:30,593 --> 01:12:32,995
She overlooked my faults...

846
01:12:33,629 --> 01:12:37,098
and I'm sorry she did.

847
01:12:37,966 --> 01:12:41,736
If she hadn't, I probably would have
done something about them.

848
01:12:42,537 --> 01:12:46,341
Be careful of women who love you
just the way you are.

849
01:12:46,574 --> 01:12:50,478
It's a sure sign they
settle too easily.

850
01:12:59,219 --> 01:13:01,388
It's...

851
01:13:02,088 --> 01:13:04,090
wonderful.

852
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:10,296
Thank you, darling.

853
01:13:44,127 --> 01:13:46,329
Did you really like it?

854
01:13:47,497 --> 01:13:49,266
I loved it.

855
01:13:50,633 --> 01:13:52,602
But do you think it's commercial?

856
01:13:53,236 --> 01:13:57,073
People always buy Tobias's novels
whether or not they read them.

857
01:13:57,974 --> 01:14:01,176
It's the nice thing
about being an icon.

858
01:14:07,315 --> 01:14:09,351
-Excuse me?
-Are you all right?

859
01:14:09,684 --> 01:14:12,987
-Couldn't sleep.
-Are you feeling unwell?

860
01:14:13,554 --> 01:14:16,023
I feel wonderful.

861
01:14:16,223 --> 01:14:18,959
That's why I couldn't sleep.
I didn't want to sleep through it.

862
01:14:20,294 --> 01:14:22,229
What are you drinking?

863
01:14:22,763 --> 01:14:24,365
Water...

864
01:14:24,898 --> 01:14:29,636
with just enough malt in it to take
the metallic taste away from it.

865
01:14:36,375 --> 01:14:38,010
I...

866
01:14:39,712 --> 01:14:42,181
just wanted to...

867
01:14:43,048 --> 01:14:46,952
tell you how grateful
I am to both of you.

868
01:14:48,887 --> 01:14:53,158
And good night.

869
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:58,329
Sleep well, my darling.

870
01:15:03,468 --> 01:15:06,103
You need something.

871
01:15:14,411 --> 01:15:17,380
I don't want to be alone tonight.

872
01:15:18,882 --> 01:15:20,684
Not tonight.

873
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:50,544
-Come and lie down, please.
-Thank you, darling.

874
01:16:38,688 --> 01:16:40,156
Hi.

875
01:16:42,258 --> 01:16:44,227
Are you going out?

876
01:16:46,229 --> 01:16:49,999
I wanted to pick up Nathaniel
and go get something to eat.

877
01:16:50,199 --> 01:16:52,869
-Give us a chance to talk.
-What would we talk about, Byron?

878
01:16:57,673 --> 01:16:59,441
Where are you going?

879
01:17:00,642 --> 01:17:04,046
Why don't you tell me where
you've been going every night?

880
01:17:05,847 --> 01:17:08,483
Look at me and you tell me!

881
01:17:11,286 --> 01:17:15,656
You are such a fucking asshole!
And I'm an asshole!

882
01:17:15,856 --> 01:17:18,492
I was so fucking blind to it!

883
01:17:19,393 --> 01:17:22,629
It's none of your business
where I'm going!

884
01:17:38,243 --> 01:17:40,145
How are you?

885
01:17:40,346 --> 01:17:42,548
Pretty good.

886
01:17:43,349 --> 01:17:45,818
-Mind if I sit down?
-Go ahead.

887
01:17:50,221 --> 01:17:52,790
You haven't been around much.

888
01:17:53,658 --> 01:17:57,962
-I've left you messages.
-I took a bit of time off myself.

889
01:17:59,396 --> 01:18:02,099
So what's on your mind?

890
01:18:03,601 --> 01:18:05,903
You said to me once
that you were married.

891
01:18:09,039 --> 01:18:12,342
-While you were in the business?
-Well, there was some overlapping.

892
01:18:13,643 --> 01:18:15,611
-And?
-And what?

893
01:18:18,614 --> 01:18:21,350
Is that what wrecked your marriage?

894
01:18:22,618 --> 01:18:24,787
Relationships are complicated.

895
01:18:24,987 --> 01:18:27,656
It's never just
one thing that ends them.

896
01:18:27,856 --> 01:18:31,026
You had told me that most of your
employees were married.

897
01:18:31,226 --> 01:18:36,331
I didn't say happily. You've got
to learn to listen for adjectives.

898
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:05,858
Now that I finished the book, I have
a little bit more time on my hands .

899
01:19:06,559 --> 01:19:09,495
I'd like to come by.
Maybe have some lunch.

900
01:19:10,729 --> 01:19:14,666
I won't be there. I think it's time
I was leaving the business.

901
01:19:16,301 --> 01:19:18,169
Maybe you should think
of doing the same.

902
01:19:18,536 --> 01:19:22,006
-I'm a writer now.
-They're still paying you as a whore.

903
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:24,308
Don't forget that.
They never do.

904
01:19:25,676 --> 01:19:27,578
Bye-bye.

905
01:19:30,547 --> 01:19:32,449
What are you gonna do?

906
01:19:36,286 --> 01:19:38,755
Best I can, I imagine.

907
01:19:48,831 --> 01:19:53,202
"That's another important object to
accomplish 10,000 years to come."

908
01:19:53,736 --> 01:19:55,637
Come in.

909
01:19:58,173 --> 01:20:01,309
-I thought you might like some tea.
-Thank you. That's very kind.

910
01:20:01,509 --> 01:20:03,077
Thank you, Byron.
That's...

911
01:20:04,379 --> 01:20:06,781
very nice of you.
Thank you.

912
01:20:11,285 --> 01:20:13,854
-Listen, I was wondering.
-Yes?

913
01:20:16,957 --> 01:20:21,528
-When will the book be published?
-We were talking about that, right?

914
01:20:22,029 --> 01:20:23,997
Yes, well, we...

915
01:20:24,964 --> 01:20:30,269
we thought it might be a good idea
if we waited until I died.

916
01:20:35,407 --> 01:20:37,476
Excuse me, but what for?

917
01:20:38,010 --> 01:20:40,979
Well, if you publish posthumously,
I'm a red hot ticket.

918
01:20:41,313 --> 01:20:46,084
Critics will be afraid to shit on me,
and sales will go through the roof.

919
01:20:49,821 --> 01:20:53,992
0h, no, now don't be upset.
I mean, my doctor says I have...

920
01:20:54,325 --> 01:20:58,029
a few weeks left. A month.
At most.

921
01:20:59,496 --> 01:21:03,200
Now it'll mean that you're
well taken care of.

922
01:21:03,834 --> 01:21:07,237
And that will make me happy.

923
01:21:10,139 --> 01:21:12,608
Thank you for the tea.

924
01:21:18,481 --> 01:21:20,483
Byron. Wait a minute.

925
01:21:31,193 --> 01:21:33,895
If it would make you
feel any better...

926
01:21:34,796 --> 01:21:39,400
I've already begun
to have chest pains.

927
01:21:52,112 --> 01:21:55,848
Mark Twain, huh? I like him.

928
01:21:56,382 --> 01:22:01,286
He always has a way of turning
a phrase that makes me feel good.

929
01:22:01,487 --> 01:22:05,457
"Let this drop fall patiently
during 5,000 years.

930
01:22:05,691 --> 01:22:07,593
It's falling now...

931
01:22:08,126 --> 01:22:11,730
it'll still be falling when all
these things shall be sunk down.

932
01:22:11,930 --> 01:22:16,234
The afternoon of history and
the twilight of tradition will be..."

933
01:22:43,926 --> 01:22:46,262
I feel so foolish.

934
01:22:47,864 --> 01:22:50,565
Couldn't think of a word to say.

935
01:22:57,205 --> 01:23:01,843
-It was a beautiful service.
-I was fortunate.

936
01:23:02,977 --> 01:23:06,748
I said everything I wanted
to say to him before he died.

937
01:23:12,386 --> 01:23:17,457
I'd like to write a foreword to the
book. To thank him. Do you like that?

938
01:23:18,792 --> 01:23:21,094
Very much.

939
01:23:23,463 --> 01:23:26,899
-But it won't be necessary.
-No, it's no trouble. I wanna do it.

940
01:23:27,133 --> 01:23:29,302
I'm very proud of our work.

941
01:23:30,736 --> 01:23:34,573
-Your work.
-The novel is very special to me.

942
01:23:35,741 --> 01:23:39,111
Byron, I know this is going
to disappoint you, but...

943
01:23:39,344 --> 01:23:43,148
I wasn't privy to any deal you made
with my husband. And...

944
01:23:43,348 --> 01:23:48,086
as far as I can tell,
you never had a contract.

945
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:52,790
-What are you saying?
-0r any proof of a verbal agreement.

946
01:23:52,990 --> 01:23:56,427
Well, excuse me a second.
I wrote that book.

947
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:01,665
-You understand.
-Understand what? I wrote that book!

948
01:24:01,898 --> 01:24:04,534
I can't have any name beside his.

949
01:24:05,535 --> 01:24:08,204
Then everyone will know he needed
help, and I can't have that.

950
01:24:08,404 --> 01:24:13,009
You were the one who wanted to hold
off the publishing until he died.

951
01:24:13,209 --> 01:24:15,812
I had to protect his reputation.

952
01:24:17,312 --> 01:24:19,314
And you made that possible.

953
01:24:19,548 --> 01:24:21,550
0h, yes, I did!

954
01:24:24,052 --> 01:24:26,321
I gave up my life for this.

955
01:24:26,588 --> 01:24:29,590
I gave up my life for this book!

956
01:24:30,358 --> 01:24:32,627
And that's all you can say to me?

957
01:24:35,029 --> 01:24:38,032
Thank you for a wonderful time.

958
01:24:45,372 --> 01:24:48,808
There is no fucking way
you're gonna get away with this!

959
01:24:49,976 --> 01:24:52,112
-You don't have a choice.
-No?

960
01:24:52,445 --> 01:24:54,247
Unless you want
to humiliate yourself.

961
01:24:55,448 --> 01:24:58,584
Remember... you've been
handsomely paid for your services.

962
01:25:05,257 --> 01:25:07,692
Please, don't hate me.

963
01:25:10,361 --> 01:25:13,030
If you'd ever been in love,
you'd understand.

964
01:25:16,634 --> 01:25:18,803
Fuck you.

965
01:25:40,456 --> 01:25:43,692
The number you have reached
is not accessible anymore.

966
01:25:43,926 --> 01:25:48,430
And there's no new number. Be sure
you have checked the directory...

967
01:26:45,650 --> 01:26:48,853
You must be the man
from Elysian Fields.

968
01:26:50,421 --> 01:26:53,257
Is it that obvious?

969
01:26:55,559 --> 01:26:59,763
-I made a reservation at Huntington.
-My husband eats there.

970
01:27:00,263 --> 01:27:05,435
-Well, we can go someplace else.
-It's 0K. He looks right through me.

971
01:27:07,036 --> 01:27:10,306
-That's impossible.
-Thank you.

972
01:27:10,773 --> 01:27:14,810
-He's probably very busy at work.
-So he tells me.

973
01:27:15,945 --> 01:27:18,213
You know, when a man
is concerned...

974
01:27:19,581 --> 01:27:24,786
with taking care of his family, his
priorities can get all scrambled.

975
01:27:24,986 --> 01:27:29,224
But it has nothing to do with love.

976
01:27:29,857 --> 01:27:34,528
For what I'm paying you, I expect
you to be on my side in everything.

977
01:27:36,063 --> 01:27:38,532
-Yes, ma'am.
-Now...

978
01:27:38,966 --> 01:27:41,668
I'm just going to powder my nose.

979
01:27:53,813 --> 01:27:56,248
I thought I'd bump into you here.

980
01:27:56,448 --> 01:27:59,151
-Having drinks?
-No, just leaving.

981
01:27:59,351 --> 01:28:01,086
Who are you with?

982
01:28:03,088 --> 01:28:05,690
Norma Van Reuten, of San Marino.

983
01:28:06,491 --> 01:28:08,426
-Christ!
-What?

984
01:28:08,626 --> 01:28:12,997
She's the one who likes having her
toes sucked. Just some advice...

985
01:28:13,431 --> 01:28:17,368
make it easy on yourself. Do not
take her dancing first, okay?

986
01:28:20,504 --> 01:28:23,874
-Thanks.
-We got to watch each other's backs.

987
01:28:24,808 --> 01:28:27,043
Who are you dragging
around tonight?

988
01:28:27,411 --> 01:28:29,145
Her.

989
01:29:00,708 --> 01:29:03,343
What, we're not getting a room?

990
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:08,749
What makes a man do what you do?

991
01:29:08,949 --> 01:29:12,886
I think of our mission as a way of
giving joy to others, my darling.

992
01:29:13,153 --> 01:29:17,523
Actually, I really need
to know the truth.

993
01:29:20,927 --> 01:29:22,895
Well, that's simple...

994
01:29:24,330 --> 01:29:28,467
fucking is the last resort
for a man who feels impotent.

995
01:29:32,304 --> 01:29:34,339
Thank you.

996
01:29:35,140 --> 01:29:37,175
Good night.

997
01:29:39,243 --> 01:29:41,445
Good night.

998
01:29:46,884 --> 01:29:50,287
This business has a way
of making you look a little older.

999
01:29:50,821 --> 01:29:55,191
And perhaps
even a notch or two wiser.

1000
01:30:41,968 --> 01:30:45,538
-Any thoughts?
-I'll have the linguini with clams.

1001
01:30:46,673 --> 01:30:48,341
Good choice. And you, sir?

1002
01:30:48,841 --> 01:30:52,077
-What would you suggest?
-Try the pasta primavera.

1003
01:30:53,745 --> 01:30:55,914
Not very convincing.

1004
01:30:57,115 --> 01:30:59,051
What is "primavera"?

1005
01:30:59,351 --> 01:31:01,953
Spring.
Vegetables with pasta.

1006
01:31:02,421 --> 01:31:05,590
-What, like squash?
-Like squash.

1007
01:31:05,857 --> 01:31:08,726
-Are those fresh?
-Like spring.

1008
01:31:09,393 --> 01:31:11,295
Fine.

1009
01:31:24,641 --> 01:31:27,277
Take ten.
I'll cover for you.

1010
01:31:40,723 --> 01:31:42,291
-Hi.
-Hi.

1011
01:31:47,896 --> 01:31:51,032
Sorry.
They're my set to the house.

1012
01:31:56,704 --> 01:31:59,006
I heard Dom gave you a job.

1013
01:32:00,608 --> 01:32:03,910
I figure that the only thing I have
a chance of getting back...

1014
01:32:04,711 --> 01:32:07,581
is my self-respect.

1015
01:32:09,182 --> 01:32:11,051
Did it work?

1016
01:32:11,251 --> 01:32:13,786
It'd be a lot easier without
my clip-on bow tie.

1017
01:32:26,164 --> 01:32:29,468
-How's my boy?
-0h, he's fine. Good.

1018
01:32:31,036 --> 01:32:34,772
-He's talking a lot?
-He asks about you.

1019
01:32:40,445 --> 01:32:44,215
-Are you writing?
-If I'm writing?

1020
01:32:46,984 --> 01:32:51,955
I'm having a little trouble.
Coming up with inspiration.

1021
01:33:04,801 --> 01:33:09,438
Have you eaten? I have
a dinner break in twenty minutes.

1022
01:33:10,105 --> 01:33:13,341
I don't think so.
I have to get back.

1023
01:33:15,644 --> 01:33:18,947
-I understand.
-I just...

1024
01:33:19,214 --> 01:33:21,849
came to tell you that Nathaniel and I
moved back to the old neighborhood.

1025
01:33:22,049 --> 01:33:24,285
I heard.
I've been trying to reach you.

1026
01:33:25,286 --> 01:33:28,256
Your phone is unlisted.

1027
01:33:32,092 --> 01:33:35,228
I guess I've just been
in that kind of a mood.

1028
01:33:38,564 --> 01:33:41,267
I'm so sorry.

1029
01:33:44,703 --> 01:33:46,605
-Believe me...
-Good night, Byron.

1030
01:33:58,550 --> 01:34:01,519
This is Nathaniel's direct line.

1031
01:34:11,295 --> 01:34:14,097
Wow, such a beauty! You know
how you two look together?

1032
01:34:14,298 --> 01:34:16,767
-How?
-Natural.

1033
01:34:18,769 --> 01:34:24,040
I gotta see my wife, you know how
she gets if nobody orders her specials.

1034
01:34:24,241 --> 01:34:26,976
-It's not her fault.
-I tell her: "It's not your fault".

1035
01:34:27,176 --> 01:34:30,179
-But she's so sensitive!
-It's the menu.

1036
01:34:30,412 --> 01:34:33,782
-What's wrong with the menu?
-You want me to be honest?

1037
01:34:33,982 --> 01:34:37,586
-Just a little.
-Everything sounds exactly the same.

1038
01:34:37,786 --> 01:34:42,324
Manicotti sounds like 0ssobuco. You
use "succulent" to describe 3 dishes!

1039
01:34:43,625 --> 01:34:47,362
-Want me to look? I'll rewrite it.
-You'll do that for me?

1040
01:34:52,333 --> 01:34:54,635
I'm feeling inspired.

1041
01:34:56,336 --> 01:34:59,940
I did see him one more time.
It was about a year later.

1042
01:35:00,140 --> 01:35:05,078
He'd written a novel titled "Eclipse"
about a marriage falling apart.

1043
01:35:05,312 --> 01:35:08,715
I took a certain pride in knowing
I'd helped ruin his life enough...

1044
01:35:08,915 --> 01:35:12,218
to give him something
substantial to write about.

1045
01:35:13,586 --> 01:35:18,324
"In a moment, she would turn
and he'd never see her again.

1046
01:35:19,791 --> 01:35:22,761
There were things that he knew
that he should have said.

1047
01:35:23,095 --> 01:35:25,297
That he wanted to say.

1048
01:35:26,631 --> 01:35:29,601
But when he looked
into his wife's face...

1049
01:35:29,935 --> 01:35:33,204
all he could remember is what
the old man had said.

1050
01:35:36,441 --> 01:35:40,411
'Be careful of women who are content
to love you just as you are.

1051
01:35:41,144 --> 01:35:44,582
It's a sure sign
they settle too easily'.

1052
01:35:44,815 --> 01:35:47,784
His wife loved him too much
to be willing to settle.

1053
01:35:47,984 --> 01:35:51,754
But he no longer had
the conscience to change.

1054
01:35:52,555 --> 01:35:55,859
He had convinced himself that
everything he was doing...

1055
01:35:57,026 --> 01:35:59,461
he was doing for her.

1056
01:36:00,362 --> 01:36:03,966
He had mastered the fatal technique
of believing his own lies.

1057
01:36:05,468 --> 01:36:09,637
Then one day,
his wife and child were gone.

1058
01:36:12,674 --> 01:36:17,812
He had everything a man could ever
need except a reason to wake up.

1059
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:22,816
That single split second
after you open your eyes...

1060
01:36:23,117 --> 01:36:25,285
and there's that someone
to turn to...

1061
01:36:27,488 --> 01:36:28,889
who loves you...

1062
01:36:29,490 --> 01:36:34,661
who loves you more and holds you
tighter through defeat and victory.

1063
01:36:49,908 --> 01:36:52,911
He poured himself another scotch...

1064
01:36:53,912 --> 01:36:57,315
knowing then that he would
spend the rest of his life...

1065
01:37:03,854 --> 01:37:08,726
trying to gain
that split second back."

1066
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:12,029
Thanks for coming.

1067
01:37:21,438 --> 01:37:22,806
Thank you.

1068
01:37:23,339 --> 01:37:26,142
-What's your name?
-Yasmim, with a "Y".

1069
01:37:29,545 --> 01:37:32,181
-I really loved your book.
-Thank you.

1070
01:37:35,050 --> 01:37:36,085
There you go.

1071
01:37:36,318 --> 01:37:37,686
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1072
01:37:37,886 --> 01:37:39,221
-Hi.
-Hi.

1073
01:37:39,421 --> 01:37:40,722
-What's your name?
-Georgette.

1074
01:37:41,924 --> 01:37:44,225
-It was very touching.
-Thank you.

1075
01:37:44,425 --> 01:37:46,894
I just wish she'd taken him
back in the end.

1076
01:37:49,597 --> 01:37:51,399
So do I.

1077
01:37:52,833 --> 01:37:56,370
I've been married 3 times, and I all
know is when it's over, it's over.

1078
01:37:56,637 --> 01:37:59,272
You gotta know
when it's time to move on.

1079
01:38:04,478 --> 01:38:06,779
It's time.

1080
01:38:14,453 --> 01:38:15,855
The name?

1081
01:38:18,757 --> 01:38:20,625
Make it out to Nathaniel.

1082
01:38:35,572 --> 01:38:37,408
Did you read it?

1083
01:38:39,810 --> 01:38:43,247
Why couldn't you say
those things to me before?

1084
01:38:49,719 --> 01:38:52,522
I'm a writer.

1085
01:39:31,157 --> 01:39:33,827
I'd spent years trying
to pleasure women.

1086
01:39:34,127 --> 01:39:38,798
He learned that what's important
is knowing how to please...

1087
01:39:38,998 --> 01:39:40,866
only one.

1088
01:39:41,300 --> 01:39:44,470
Now there's
something to write about.
