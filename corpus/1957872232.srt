1
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:41,917
[Chad] So you've seen it?

2
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:43,418
[Dean] Only in pictures.

3
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,754
I helped Julie out
with a lot of research.

4
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,716
[female voice whispers] Welcome.

5
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:51,510
[Chad] All right, let's go!

6
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,303
We've got a long drive
ahead of us.

7
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,766
[Mike] We're headed to famous
Goldfield Hotel.

8
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,601
We're hoping to see
some real ghosts.

9
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,270
[Julie] No.
Don't film me, please!

10
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:03,188
[Dean] Can't believe
your parents spend

11
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:05,691
twenty grand a year on you
with a ghost major.

12
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:07,568
-Psychology major.
-[Dean] I'm sorry.

13
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:09,069
[Julie] There's a difference.

14
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,237
[whispers] My Baby.

15
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:12,197
[Julie] The hotel
is said to be haunted

16
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:13,866
by various people
who died there.

17
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,659
[Julie] Most notably, Elizabeth.

18
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,369
[Julie] Who's searching
her child.

19
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,163
[Julie] People say
they can hear baby cries

20
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:21,582
in the halls late at night.

21
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,670
[female whispers]
Are you ready to die...

22
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,505
for love?

23
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,592
[Julie] This is going
to be awesome!

24
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,260
-[Dean] I bet.
-[Julie] How often

25
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,511
you see a haunted hotel?

26
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:35,637
[Julie giggles]

27
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,808
[Mike] if you start kissing
and making out and shit...

28
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:42,227
[Chad] If that happens
give me the camera!

29
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:44,980
-[Julie] Why do guys love that?
-[Chad] Girls gone wild!

30
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,315
[Julie] It's so stupid!

31
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:48,734
[Keri] Guys love girls on girls.
Why is that hot?

32
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,360
[Mike] Girls on girls
is cheaper.

33
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,112
[Chad] What happens here
stays here.

34
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:53,947
-[Keri] So lame.
-[Julie] Do you know

35
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:56,200
psychics believe
the hotel itself

36
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:57,868
may be a portal
to the other side?

37
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,494
[Dean] The hotel's
closed, right?

38
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:01,496
[Julie] Yeah. It's more of a
museum, now.

39
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,749
The town is abandoned
since the mine closed,

40
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,125
over thirty years ago.

41
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:06,585
[Mike] Okay, I got it!

42
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:07,878
I know what we should do!

43
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,380
We should run
haunted tours of the place!

44
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:11,798
T-shirts, coffee mugs...

45
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:14,301
[Chad] Dean, the most
intelligent guy in the world

46
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:15,594
filling up the vehicle.

47
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,930
Beautiful Julie,
working on her thesis.

48
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,139
How's it going?

49
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,724
[Julie] Very exciting stuff.

50
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,103
[Julie] First, we'll visit

51
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:26,647
the caretaker of the Hotel.

52
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:27,981
He runs this bar in town.

53
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,775
He'll give us the keys
and he said

54
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,360
we can film as much as we want.

55
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,153
Wow. How'd you swing that?

56
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,864
I said we were filming
for the Discovery Channel.

57
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,158
[chuckles]

58
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,161
[soft music playing]

59
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:57,511
[Chad] It says we turn off here.

60
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,179
That will lead us
right into town.

61
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,848
Should save us an hour or two.

62
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,432
I don't know.

63
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,434
Sometimes shortcuts
don't work out.

64
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:07,271
What do you say Miss Producer?

65
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:08,897
Do it!

66
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,816
[eerie music]

67
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,257
[female whispers] Come to me.

68
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,759
Come back to me.

69
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,522
[Mike] What's that?

70
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,107
[Dean] That didn't sound good.

71
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:54,276
[Mike] What's wrong
with this piece of shit?

72
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,944
[Dean] I don't know.
It just died.

73
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,117
[Chad] Dean, what's going on?

74
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,119
[Dean] Uh, nothing.
It just died.

75
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:06,038
[Mike] I knew this was
a piece of shit.

76
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,664
[Dean] My cousin
had it tuned up.

77
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:08,957
Nothing's wrong with it.

78
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,626
"Nothing wrong
with the car Mike"

79
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,920
Is that why it stopped
and the engine's dead?

80
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,339
-To check out the scenery?
-Okay, Mike... shut up.

81
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,674
[Dean sighs] Let me check
the engine.

82
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,136
You better check the engine.

83
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,437
[Chad] What's wrong?

84
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,064
[Dean] I have no idea.

85
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:33,232
[Mike] Oh, come on!

86
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:35,025
You're supposed to be
the smart one.

87
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,528
[Dean] I don't know why
but the engine's dead.

88
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:39,947
[Chad] Looks like we're walking.

89
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,990
[Keri grunts] I'm not walking!

90
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:43,909
[Julie] I don't think
we have a choice.

91
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,869
What are we going to do?
Stand here?

92
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,955
-[Julie] Come on.
-[Keri] No, you guys!

93
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,457
[Mike] Get your camera!

94
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,678
[Julie] We've been walking
so long it's dark already.

95
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,096
[Chad] We'll get there soon.

96
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:05,848
[Chad] Hey,
let me film a little.

97
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,601
[Chad] We're on route
to Goldfield Hotel...

98
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:10,686
Minus a car.

99
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,229
[Chad] How's Julie doing?

100
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:15,732
[Julie] Not having much fun
but forging along.

101
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,276
[Chad] Want to add anything?

102
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,777
[Mike] Yeah. This happens

103
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:20,070
when you drive a

104
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,572
15 year old piece of shit!

105
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:22,739
[Dean] Up yours Mike!

106
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,408
[Mike] Relax, bro.
I was kidding!

107
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:25,742
[Dean] Whatever.

108
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:28,745
[Mike] You are so uptight
when you're on a screen all day.

109
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,789
[Dean] But I'm not
chasing ass all day.

110
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,375
[Mike] Dude, are you accusing
me of something?

111
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,003
[Dean] Forget about it.
I'm just pissed about the car.

112
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:37,754
[Mike] Just watch it.

113
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,173
[Chad] Anyone's had signal?

114
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:40,257
[Julie and Dean] No.

115
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:42,968
[Mike] Hey, look.
An old cemetery. Cool!

116
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,100
[chuckles]

117
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:55,147
[Mike] Hey guys, start shooting.

118
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,149
[Julie] Yeah.
I think this is good stuff!

119
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,525
[Chad] Yeah.

120
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:00,903
Grab a stick mic
in case we want to hear.

121
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,070
[Dean] All right.

122
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,864
[Keri] I think I'll stay here.

123
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:06,992
Dean?

124
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,118
What?

125
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,412
[Keri] You're just going to
leave me here?

126
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:12,789
[Dean] Well,
we're not going to be that far

127
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,209
Besides, I got to do the audio.

128
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:22,508
[female whispering]

129
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:25,511
[whispering] Where is my...

130
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,846
[whispering] my... baby?

131
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,933
[Chad] We're in a cemetery a few
miles outside of Goldfield.

132
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,976
We're searching for the
tombstones of

133
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,353
either George Winfield...

134
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,813
Or the woman he
supposedly killed... Elizabeth.

135
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,827
[whispering] Closer my darlings.

136
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:52,538
[whispering] Closer.

137
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:54,414
[Julie] Guys, that looks cool.

138
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:55,499
Go from over there.

139
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:56,667
[Chad] All right.

140
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:05,717
[whispering] There's my tomb...

141
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,149
[whispering] Do you remember?

142
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,861
[whispering]
How could you forget?

143
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,398
[whispering angrily]
How could you forget?

144
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,952
[whispering] Where's my baby?

145
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,056
[Julie] Mike?

146
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:37,726
[Dean chuckles] Now's our chance
to ditch him.

147
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:39,228
[Chad laughs]

148
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:41,647
[whispering] Where is my baby?

149
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:43,815
[Julie] Okay, where did Mike go?

150
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:45,817
-[Chad] I don't know.
-[Julie] Mike?

151
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:48,487
[Julie] Mike! We're going!

152
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,865
[whispering] Come home my dear.

153
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,451
[screaming]

154
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:55,577
I'm so sorry!

155
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:57,746
[Julie] Keri!
You scared the shit out of me!

156
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,289
I started hearing things and--

157
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:00,791
-Where's Mike?
-I don't know.

158
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,376
-[Chad chuckles]
-[Julie] Mike?

159
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,253
Mike... Come on! Where are you?

160
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,255
-[Keri] Oh God!
-[Julie] Mike?

161
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:09,466
[Keri] It's his backpack!

162
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,884
[Chad] Where? Oh.

163
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,263
-[Julie] Mike!
-[Keri] Mike?

164
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:16,849
-[Julie] Mike!
-[Keri] Mike?

165
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,101
[Julie] Mike! Come on!

166
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,354
-[Julie screams]
-[Mike laughs]

167
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:23,897
[Julie] You asshole!

168
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:25,357
[Mike] Come on! I got you.

169
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,441
And I got you too!

170
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:28,110
[Mike] I did! What?

171
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:29,403
[Chad] Fuck you Mike.

172
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:30,696
Come on! That was funny.

173
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:32,739
[Julie] Come on, you guys.
Let's go.

174
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:35,492
[Mike laughs]

175
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:36,743
[Julie] You're horrible!

176
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:39,413
[Mike] You're mad 'cause I got
you. Yeah, that's right!

177
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,624
You guys have no sense of humor!

178
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:52,509
I'm hungry!

179
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:54,469
Of course you are.

180
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,804
Don't be an asshole!

181
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,056
If you're hungry
then eat something.

182
00:09:58,223 --> 00:09:59,474
I don't want chips.

183
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,226
Then I can't help you.

184
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,270
I figured that out
when you left me alone.

185
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,606
You wanted to stay.

186
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:07,441
You left me!

187
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:11,028
If that's your attitude
you shouldn't have come.

188
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:12,821
I wouldn't have if I had known

189
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:14,823
I'd be walking up a dirt road
all day!

190
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,834
[Chad] So this is like a ghost
town, huh?

191
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:27,628
[Julie] This is a ghost town.

192
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:30,255
The only people who come
through here are tourists.

193
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,758
[Mike laughs] Like what?
Two or three a year?

194
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:34,551
[Chad] Hey, how many people

195
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:36,470
get to spend a weekend
in a ghost town?

196
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,098
[Mike] Hey!

197
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:41,558
[Keri giggles] No!

198
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:43,393
I need a shower!

199
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:45,395
Yeah? I could help you wash
your back.

200
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:46,980
And your front.
[laughs]

201
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:48,190
[Keri] I bet you would.

202
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:50,192
-Mike!
-What? I'm just joking. Relax.

203
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,277
[Dean] Dude! What the fuck?
Inappropriate!

204
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:53,487
[Julie] Seriously.

205
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:55,322
Settle down! It was a joke!

206
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,741
Yeah, right.

207
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:03,163
Yeah. Hey, Mom?

208
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,748
Dad? Are we there yet?

209
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,334
[Julie] Okay. Tell me again
why I'm dating you?

210
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:10,003
I'll show you.

211
00:11:10,254 --> 00:11:12,130
Because you like sleeping
in these arms.

212
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:14,550
[Mike chuckles]

213
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:17,052
Oh, my God! There it is!

214
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:22,474
[Keri] Oh my God.

215
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:43,912
[Mike] Energy!

216
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:46,456
[Julie] Hi!

217
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:49,543
-I'm--
-Julie. From Discovery Channel.

218
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:52,212
Yeah. This is
my production team.

219
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:54,089
-This is Dean.
-Hey.

220
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:55,382
-[Julie] Mike.
-[Mike] Yo!

221
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:56,592
[Julie] Chad and Keri.

222
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:59,178
So, you broke down, huh?

223
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,513
Yeah. How'd you know?

224
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:06,143
I didn't hear no car
before you come in.

225
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:08,937
We actually broke down
just before the cemetery.

226
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:12,024
Actually, there's nothing
wrong with our car.

227
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,651
[bartender] There's no
tow truck until tomorrow.

228
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:18,530
Where you gonna stay?

229
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,282
At the Haven Motel.

230
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:21,909
Really?

231
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:24,453
[Julie] About twenty minutes
outside of town.

232
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:30,250
There ain't no hotel within
a hundred miles of this place.

233
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:32,961
It can't be.
I spoke with someone.

234
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:35,172
I've lived here my whole life.

235
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:39,134
Little lady, I'm telling you.
There ain't no hotel.

236
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,969
Don't worry guys... I'll call.

237
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:44,515
Hi.

238
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:52,564
[Operator] The number you
reached is not in service.

239
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:54,024
Disconnected.

240
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:58,028
I spoke with someone,
you guys. I swear I did!

241
00:12:58,403 --> 00:12:59,613
We believe you.

242
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:02,824
Okay, great. How about I order
a round of tequila, huh?

243
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,451
Ugh! Not for me.

244
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,828
Could I please get a Cosmo?

245
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:09,164
And, do you have
anything to eat?

246
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:12,125
We don't got no Cosmos here.

247
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,586
We don't got no food here.

248
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,840
Maybe tomorrow
I could get you some.

249
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,883
Well, what about
a Black Russian?

250
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,093
Could you make that?

251
00:13:21,677 --> 00:13:24,221
[yelling] We don't got
no fancy kind of drinks here!

252
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:25,889
You want a shot?

253
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,059
[quietly] I can give you a shot.

254
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,521
I don't know how this
happened, you guys.

255
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:34,356
[Chad] It's okay.
Let's figure out

256
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,024
where we're going
to stay tonight.

257
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:37,526
Hey, how about you?

258
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,194
Do you know where we could stay?

259
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:40,696
Huh?

260
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,656
Hey, I asked you a question!

261
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:45,492
[scoffs] you fucking deaf?

262
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:46,994
As a matter of fact he is.

263
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,830
And he's meaner than
a junkyard dog. So...

264
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,207
if I were you, I'd just
leave him alone, huh?

265
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:53,709
Sorry.

266
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:55,627
Yeah.

267
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:59,089
There'll be a tow
in the morning.

268
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:01,049
[Mike] That's perfect.

269
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:02,634
Do you think we can get

270
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:04,803
into the hotel tonight
and start filming?

271
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,722
Maybe even stay there?

272
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:08,182
Are you crazy?

273
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:10,767
You want to go into
a haunted hotel, at night?

274
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,604
Besides, I thought we were
supposed to start tomorrow?

275
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,314
That was the plan
but it's perfect.

276
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:16,690
And this is why we're here.

277
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:19,276
Oh, I don't-- I don't know.

278
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:20,569
[yelling] Hey Clancy!

279
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:22,654
What do you think?
Should we let them

280
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:24,031
stay in the hotel tonight?

281
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:27,284
[laughs]

282
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,496
See, I don't like to do that.

283
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:34,041
See, everything in there?

284
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:36,251
It's authentic.

285
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:37,711
Turn of the century.

286
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,005
You mean the hotel's
still furnished?

287
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:41,757
You're damn right.

288
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:43,717
Well, I'm not staying there.

289
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:47,971
Well, you could stay here
on the floor

290
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:50,516
but I gotta warn you, got rats.

291
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:51,892
Oh, my God!

292
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:53,644
-I'm not staying here!
-Okay, okay.

293
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,230
Well, can we just
stay at the hotel?

294
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:00,192
Beds are made. You'd...

295
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,694
Have to sleep
on top of the sheets I think.

296
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:03,820
You know?

297
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:09,993
And you'd have to promise
that nothing got moved or taken.

298
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:12,037
We promise.

299
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:15,457
Well, in that case...

300
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,460
since you're from
the Discovery Channel and all,

301
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:19,586
you know?

302
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,596
That's the key
to the front door.

303
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:35,853
Thanks.

304
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:37,646
You're welcome.

305
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,731
Now, the lights are off

306
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:42,359
but the fuse box
is just down the basement.

307
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,528
That's great.
We'll take care of everything.

308
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,905
I'm sure you will, little angel.

309
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:50,117
You hear any noise...
that's just ghosts.

310
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:52,327
I'd advise you...

311
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:55,789
don't go in room 109.

312
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:57,624
[Chad] Really? Why?

313
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:03,422
[Chad] So, what can you
tell us about room 109?

314
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,800
[yelling] I can tell you to get
that camera out of my face, now!

315
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,178
Sorry.

316
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:11,555
Can I interview you now?

317
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:15,225
If you stay there, I guess so.

318
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,897
So, what can you tell us
about room 109?

319
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:29,031
You see, that's...

320
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:30,449
where it all happened.

321
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:34,077
[bartender] She died
in room 109.

322
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:36,914
George Winfield, he's...

323
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:38,916
a tough guy.

324
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:40,876
Stern boss.

325
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:43,420
No good son of a bitch!

326
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,507
Didn't deserve to be
in the same room with Elizabeth!

327
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:47,841
[female whimpering]

328
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,345
See, Elizabeth, she--

329
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:55,015
she was an angel.

330
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:56,850
Did you know her?

331
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:59,853
Oh, no. It was way
before my time but...

332
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:02,189
I saw paintings of her.

333
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:06,777
Oh, and she was an angel.

334
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:11,240
Just like you.

335
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:13,367
[bartender] An angel.

336
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:15,577
[Mike] Yeah?
I thought she was a whore.

337
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:16,787
She ain't no whore!

338
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:20,582
I'm sorry, sir.
Please, excuse him.

339
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:21,667
I'm sure your right.

340
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,001
Damn right I'm right!

341
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:27,214
You'll have to excuse me now,
little lady, but...

342
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:29,925
This interview is over.

343
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:32,010
We understand.

344
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:34,555
Thank you. Really.
You've been a big help.

345
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:35,973
Yeah. Thanks, sir and...

346
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,975
thanks for that tip with
room 109.

347
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:40,853
You guys have a nice sleep.

348
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:49,319
No hard feelings?

349
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:57,244
I'll be watching you!

350
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:06,879
[Julie] It's kind of freaky
how that guy

351
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:08,297
kept calling me his angel.

352
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,215
[Mike] Yeah, he's a freak!

353
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:13,218
[Julie] Yeah? well, you ruined
our interview with that freak.

354
00:18:13,302 --> 00:18:15,596
We're lucky he gave in
and gave us a place to stay.

355
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:17,472
[Chad] He said it's furnished.

356
00:18:17,556 --> 00:18:18,765
It shouldn't be too bad.

357
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:20,976
[Mike] Yeah. Not too bad
with an inch of dust

358
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,060
on everything.

359
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:24,938
[whispering] It's time now.

360
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:37,659
[whispering] Time to come.

361
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:06,605
[pst]

362
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:09,733
Jackson!
What are you doing here?

363
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:12,611
I love you too much.

364
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:15,113
I can't resist.

365
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:16,573
[baby sounds]

366
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:18,200
I think about you all the time.

367
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:20,953
[baby sounds]

368
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:24,665
Oh, she's so pretty.

369
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,835
She's just like her mom.

370
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:31,463
I have something

371
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,134
for the little one.

372
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:39,555
Turn around.

373
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,204
A keepsake.

374
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:06,206
Someday we'll be together.

375
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:08,667
I love you so much.

376
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:22,472
[whispering]
What would you risk for love?

377
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:33,734
-[Dean] It's so cold out here.
-[Mike] Oh, man!

378
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:35,694
[Keri] Why did we even stop?

379
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:37,070
[Chad] Hey, Dean. Get the mic.

380
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:38,363
[Dean] All right.

381
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:44,036
[Keri] Oh, my God!

382
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,956
[Mike grunts]

383
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:50,042
[Chad] Hey,
make sure you shut that door.

384
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:52,377
[Mike chuckles]

385
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:54,379
[Keri] Guys, this place
is creepy.

386
00:20:54,463 --> 00:20:55,506
[Chad] Check it out!

387
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:56,798
[Mike] What?

388
00:20:57,549 --> 00:20:58,592
[Mike chuckles]

389
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:02,346
[Keri] So should we just...
find a place to sleep?

390
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:05,057
[Julie] We need the fuse box
to turn the lights on.

391
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,475
[Chad] No, no, no. Not yet.

392
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:08,644
Let's unpack the gear
and I'll go find it.

393
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:11,063
-[Julie] Yeah.
-[Mike] Let's find some ghosts!

394
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,190
[Julie] I'm going to get
an EMS scanner.

395
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:14,816
Keri, will you help me
with this?

396
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:16,485
[Keri] Sure.

397
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:18,904
[Chad] Let me film you
unpacking the gear.

398
00:21:21,365 --> 00:21:22,533
[Julie] All right.

399
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:24,952
Okay. I got it.

400
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,956
All right... let's go.

401
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:31,667
[Chad] Let's do it.

402
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:48,725
We could probably sell this
on eBay and make a killing.

403
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:50,853
[Dean] Guess what Keri?

404
00:21:50,978 --> 00:21:52,563
We're not stealing anything.

405
00:21:53,564 --> 00:21:56,525
I didn't say I was going
to steal anything!

406
00:21:57,651 --> 00:21:58,735
[Dean] Put it back!

407
00:21:58,861 --> 00:22:00,028
I didn't take anything!

408
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:01,780
Keri!

409
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,031
Put it back!

410
00:22:05,242 --> 00:22:06,535
[Keri sighs]

411
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:10,581
You're no fun!

412
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:15,377
Come here Keri.

413
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:17,963
I'm sorry, okay?

414
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:22,968
[loud scream]

415
00:22:23,177 --> 00:22:24,344
[Mike laughing]

416
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:25,804
Oh, I got you guys so good!

417
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:27,055
Damn it Mike!

418
00:22:27,181 --> 00:22:28,307
Real immature.

419
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:30,225
Man, I gotta be me!

420
00:22:32,186 --> 00:22:33,729
I'm going to go look around.

421
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:35,564
This place is too cold.

422
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:36,815
Oh! Come on girl!

423
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:38,525
We got to get the party...
all right!

424
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,661
[laughs]

425
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:53,373
I know you want some of that.

426
00:22:53,624 --> 00:22:54,666
Give me that!

427
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:56,126
At a girl!

428
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:00,380
[Mike] Save some for me!

429
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:01,965
I drooled on myself!

430
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:04,092
[Mike] It's a good look for you.

431
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:05,427
[laughs]

432
00:23:12,768 --> 00:23:14,520
[Mike] Let's stay here
and get drunk.

433
00:23:14,603 --> 00:23:15,854
[both laughing]

434
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,621
[Dean] Hello?

435
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,541
[Dean] Mike?

436
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:37,793
[Dean] Is that you?
I'm gonna kill you.

437
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:43,549
Great, Dean.

438
00:23:44,383 --> 00:23:46,927
You walk into a haunted hotel,
the first thing you do?

439
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:48,762
Wonder off by yourself.

440
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,516
Looks like I just failed
haunted house 101.

441
00:23:53,851 --> 00:23:54,852
Okay.

442
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:56,478
So I'm a goner.

443
00:23:56,645 --> 00:23:57,729
[chuckles]

444
00:24:06,989 --> 00:24:09,324
[Chad] The bartender said
the breaker is this way.

445
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:12,661
[Julie] There's nothing here.
Just keep going.

446
00:24:13,704 --> 00:24:14,705
[electronic beeping]

447
00:24:15,247 --> 00:24:16,373
Wait!

448
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:18,250
I'm picking up something.

449
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:20,794
It's over there.

450
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:55,078
[strange noises]

451
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:14,640
[beeping]

452
00:25:16,058 --> 00:25:18,435
[Julie] I'm getting some
crazy readings here.

453
00:25:24,024 --> 00:25:25,734
[creepy noise]

454
00:25:33,242 --> 00:25:35,661
Wait!
It's coming from over there.

455
00:25:39,957 --> 00:25:42,960
[female whispers] What have you
done with my baby?

456
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:51,009
[Chad] I don't see anything.

457
00:25:52,511 --> 00:25:54,429
[Julie] I'm not getting
anything anymore.

458
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:59,351
This is where he said
the breaker wall should be.

459
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:04,439
Found it!

460
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,403
Yeah!

461
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:12,114
[loud female scream]

462
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,868
That sounds like Keri.

463
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:18,161
We should probably
get back to the lobby.

464
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:22,374
[whispers] Please.

465
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:26,378
[whispers]
Please help me find my child.

466
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:28,714
There's nothing wrong.

467
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:31,133
-There's no ghost
-[Chad] What the hell happened?

468
00:26:31,216 --> 00:26:32,926
-Is everything all right?
-Yes.

469
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:35,929
[Mike] Actually what happened is
the lobby door slammed shut.

470
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:37,306
Must have been the wind

471
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:39,474
but it scared the crap
out of our girl here.

472
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:42,144
I'm sorry, guys.
It was really stupid.

473
00:26:42,394 --> 00:26:44,062
But it did scare
the crap out of me.

474
00:26:44,188 --> 00:26:46,023
Hey, we're in
a haunted hotel, right?

475
00:26:47,816 --> 00:26:49,651
God damn it!

476
00:26:49,735 --> 00:26:51,528
-What?
-It's like the third

477
00:26:52,154 --> 00:26:53,530
-What?
-[Julie] Okay, guys.

478
00:26:53,614 --> 00:26:55,574
Stop messing around.
I gotta do my thesis.

479
00:26:55,657 --> 00:26:57,284
Let's go. Let's go film.

480
00:26:57,534 --> 00:26:59,453
[Dean] Cool. I gotta get
my sound system.

481
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:02,164
Come on.

482
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:15,302
[Mike] So, did you guys see
any freaky shit downstairs?

483
00:27:15,928 --> 00:27:17,179
[Julie] Not really.

484
00:27:17,638 --> 00:27:18,680
[Julie] To be honest,

485
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:21,016
we got some crazy readings
in the basement.

486
00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:24,394
[Mike] Do you think there are
some capers down there or what?

487
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:26,813
[Julie] I hope so.
That's what we're here for.

488
00:27:26,897 --> 00:27:29,358
[Mike] Damn straight!
Damn straight.

489
00:27:29,566 --> 00:27:32,361
[Dean] And then there was light.

490
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,112
[Mike laughs]

491
00:27:34,238 --> 00:27:35,572
-[Chad] Dang.
-[Mike] Oh man.

492
00:27:35,697 --> 00:27:37,324
-You want to start shooting?
-Yeah.

493
00:28:03,684 --> 00:28:05,853
[Chad] Did you get anything yet?

494
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:07,646
No. It's really faint.

495
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:10,315
My God. If we really see
a ghost we'll freak!

496
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:13,443
[Chad chuckling] Come on,
ghosts can't hurt you.

497
00:28:13,527 --> 00:28:14,653
[Keri] How do you know?

498
00:28:14,987 --> 00:28:16,905
-[Chad] I don't.
-[Keri] great!

499
00:28:17,906 --> 00:28:19,741
[Mike] I ain't afraid
of no ghosts!

500
00:28:19,992 --> 00:28:21,827
Maybe we should try
the basement again.

501
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,954
Isn't that where you said
you saw something

502
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:26,206
when you and Chad
went to flip the breaker?

503
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:28,125
[Keri] Look guys, I'm
like starving!

504
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:29,626
[Keri] Can we just eat first?

505
00:28:29,835 --> 00:28:31,837
[Mike] Seriously.
I could use some chow.

506
00:28:32,004 --> 00:28:33,338
Hey, Jules. What do you say?

507
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:35,299
[Julie] Yeah. Sure. I guess so.

508
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:38,260
[Julie] Come on, over here.

509
00:28:52,316 --> 00:28:55,110
[Mike] She's been obsessing
about this for over a year now.

510
00:28:55,235 --> 00:28:57,988
[Julie] I wasn't obsessing.
It's just a fascinating story.

511
00:28:58,197 --> 00:28:59,364
[Chad] It's pretty cool!

512
00:28:59,448 --> 00:29:00,741
[Keri] Well, let's hear it.

513
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:02,117
[Julie] Okay.

514
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:03,869
Well, it was about this woman.

515
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:05,913
She was very beautiful.

516
00:29:05,996 --> 00:29:08,916
She caught the eye of the owner
of the hotel, George Winfield.

517
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:11,627
She became, sort of,
like a kept woman.

518
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,295
[Keri] So why didn't he
marry her?

519
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:15,130
[Julie] He was already married.

520
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:17,508
[Mike] Damn!
A pervert and a player!

521
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:19,760
[Keri] Oh, my God. Man suck!

522
00:29:19,885 --> 00:29:21,303
-[Mike laughs]
-[Dean] What?

523
00:29:21,512 --> 00:29:23,013
[Julie] So it's about this time

524
00:29:23,096 --> 00:29:24,806
that she became pregnant

525
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:28,769
and George pressured
her to get what was then

526
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:30,437
an illegal abortion.

527
00:29:30,771 --> 00:29:33,440
Elizabeth... refused.

528
00:29:33,732 --> 00:29:36,360
And even though they
no longer shared intimacies

529
00:29:36,527 --> 00:29:39,029
George didn't want her
to be anyone else's.

530
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,698
He wanted her to be
his own kept woman.

531
00:29:42,574 --> 00:29:45,202
Well, that was until
he found out the truth.

532
00:29:45,744 --> 00:29:46,745
What was the truth?

533
00:29:47,371 --> 00:29:49,289
She betrayed him.

534
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:52,501
Elizabeth had fallen in love
with another man

535
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:54,294
by the name of
Jackson Smith.

536
00:29:54,962 --> 00:29:56,922
He was a bartender
who worked in the hotel

537
00:29:57,214 --> 00:29:59,049
and the baby was actually his.

538
00:30:00,092 --> 00:30:03,053
[Julie] So George was outraged.

539
00:30:03,345 --> 00:30:06,265
[Julie] He was not going to let
some servant girl

540
00:30:06,974 --> 00:30:08,350
make a fool of him.

541
00:30:08,475 --> 00:30:09,768
[Keri] So what did he do?

542
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:11,144
Well...

543
00:30:11,228 --> 00:30:13,480
when Jackson Smith
was out of town

544
00:30:13,564 --> 00:30:16,775
and he was trying to figure out
an escape for her,

545
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,193
Elizabeth and himself,

546
00:30:18,652 --> 00:30:19,653
George...

547
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:22,614
took Elizabeth into room 109,

548
00:30:23,073 --> 00:30:26,827
tied her up... shackled her...
and tortured her.

549
00:30:27,452 --> 00:30:29,580
The more she begged and pleaded

550
00:30:29,955 --> 00:30:32,291
the more outraged and cruel
he became.

551
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:34,168
And then he took the baby,

552
00:30:34,918 --> 00:30:36,086
murdered it...

553
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:39,840
and threw the corpse down
the mine shaft under the hotel.

554
00:30:40,632 --> 00:30:42,009
[whispering] Please, don't!

555
00:30:42,092 --> 00:30:44,261
[Julie] So Elizabeth is said
to roam the halls

556
00:30:44,344 --> 00:30:46,805
and has to relive her death

557
00:30:46,889 --> 00:30:50,851
by the hands of George Winfield
every night for all eternity.

558
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:52,519
-[Mike scoffs]
-[Keri] Oh, my God.

559
00:30:52,644 --> 00:30:55,189
She's said to roam the halls
in search of her baby,

560
00:30:55,272 --> 00:30:56,356
crying

561
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,192
"where's my baby?

562
00:30:59,318 --> 00:31:00,569
Where's my baby?"

563
00:31:00,652 --> 00:31:02,154
[Mike chuckling] Elizabeth!

564
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:05,032
[Elizabeth whispers]
Now you can't leave either!

565
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,534
[Dean] Now that is a good story!

566
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,161
Yeah.

567
00:31:09,661 --> 00:31:11,413
Well, that's why
we're here. Right?

568
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:14,833
So... should we go
find some ghosts?

569
00:31:15,334 --> 00:31:16,919
[Dean] Hey, let's do it!

570
00:31:17,002 --> 00:31:18,295
To ghost hunting!

571
00:31:20,881 --> 00:31:24,051
[panting]

572
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:06,718
[Julie] Oh...

573
00:32:06,802 --> 00:32:08,011
[Dean] What?

574
00:32:08,804 --> 00:32:10,055
[Julie] I don't know.

575
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:12,224
The readings are going crazy!

576
00:32:12,516 --> 00:32:13,767
[Mike] What do you mean?

577
00:32:13,892 --> 00:32:16,395
[Julie] Well, one second
there's nothing and then

578
00:32:17,354 --> 00:32:18,605
and then the next

579
00:32:18,689 --> 00:32:20,232
needle hits the top.

580
00:32:20,315 --> 00:32:21,483
[Dean] What's that mean?

581
00:32:23,777 --> 00:32:24,862
[Julie] I'm not sure.

582
00:34:07,589 --> 00:34:08,799
Yeah!

583
00:34:37,536 --> 00:34:40,038
[Julie] It's like there's a door
opening and closing.

584
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:46,003
[Chad] Hey, remember what we
read about seven portals.

585
00:34:46,295 --> 00:34:47,296
[Julie] Yeah.

586
00:34:47,504 --> 00:34:50,799
Weren't the readings consistent
with portals opening or closing?

587
00:34:51,717 --> 00:34:52,759
What?

588
00:34:52,885 --> 00:34:54,970
What's a portal?
What are you talking about?

589
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:58,098
[Julie] There's supposedly
seven portals to the other side.

590
00:34:58,182 --> 00:35:00,684
I'm doing my thesis on
Goldfield Hotel because it's--

591
00:35:00,893 --> 00:35:02,060
it's one of the portals.

592
00:35:02,436 --> 00:35:05,022
That's why there's so much
supernatural activity here.

593
00:35:06,315 --> 00:35:07,316
Wait a minute.

594
00:35:07,733 --> 00:35:09,401
So we may have found a doorway

595
00:35:09,484 --> 00:35:11,653
where the dead can come
and go into our world?

596
00:35:12,279 --> 00:35:13,447
[Julie] Possibly.

597
00:35:13,655 --> 00:35:16,158
[laughs] Get the fuck
out of here!

598
00:35:16,241 --> 00:35:17,451
[Dean] Hang on, hang on!

599
00:35:17,534 --> 00:35:19,494
If there's some a doorway
to the afterlife

600
00:35:19,703 --> 00:35:21,872
why doesn't Elizabeth
just go back through?

601
00:35:22,456 --> 00:35:24,249
I don't know. Maybe she can't.

602
00:35:25,417 --> 00:35:27,878
[Chad] Maybe she's stuck here
looking for her baby.

603
00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:31,256
Being killed over and over
again. Night after night.

604
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,469
Hey! Where were you?

605
00:35:35,594 --> 00:35:36,887
Nowhere.

606
00:35:37,346 --> 00:35:38,472
What did you take?

607
00:35:38,972 --> 00:35:41,308
Nothing. Come on.

608
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:46,480
[Chad] Hey, you guys think we
should check out the mine shaft?

609
00:35:46,605 --> 00:35:47,981
[Keri] Are you crazy?

610
00:35:48,065 --> 00:35:49,316
[Julie] No. Let's just...

611
00:35:49,816 --> 00:35:51,818
Let's just check
out the rest of the hotel.

612
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:55,239
[Julie] Come on. Mike,
stop goofing off.

613
00:35:55,322 --> 00:35:56,657
[Mike chuckling] What?

614
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,659
[Mike] Come on,
let's take the portal.

615
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:18,804
Anything?

616
00:36:18,929 --> 00:36:20,264
[Julie] I don't know yet.

617
00:36:21,807 --> 00:36:23,600
[Dean] I felt
something here earlier.

618
00:36:23,892 --> 00:36:24,893
[Julie] Really?

619
00:36:25,018 --> 00:36:26,311
[Dean] Yeah.

620
00:36:26,395 --> 00:36:28,981
[Dean] It was like
I wasn't alone. You know?

621
00:36:29,106 --> 00:36:31,817
Baby! Stop it!
You're freaking me out.

622
00:36:32,526 --> 00:36:34,820
[Mike] You guys think
this bar has a happy hour?

623
00:36:35,112 --> 00:36:38,407
You know? Quarter beers?
Jello shots?

624
00:36:39,241 --> 00:36:40,534
N- no?

625
00:36:41,285 --> 00:36:43,036
Yeah. Probably not.

626
00:36:43,328 --> 00:36:44,329
Hey guys!

627
00:36:44,913 --> 00:36:46,623
I think I'm getting
something. Chad!

628
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:04,183
[loud strange noises]

629
00:37:04,558 --> 00:37:05,934
It's coming from over there.

630
00:37:08,687 --> 00:37:12,691
This is our first glimpse of the
Goldfield Hotel.

631
00:37:13,483 --> 00:37:16,820
Originally built by George
Winfield in 1903,

632
00:37:19,198 --> 00:37:21,158
it was one of the most
luxurious hotels

633
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:23,785
between Chicago
and San Francisco.

634
00:37:24,786 --> 00:37:28,207
Now, it's just another abandoned
property off the I-ninety-five.

635
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:31,793
The only residents here...

636
00:37:33,378 --> 00:37:36,590
are the abandoned souls of
guests who used to stay here.

637
00:37:38,675 --> 00:37:40,469
This is the Jack Dempsey
dinning room.

638
00:37:40,552 --> 00:37:42,262
-[whispers] Closer.
-[Chad] Ghost!

639
00:37:42,346 --> 00:37:44,223
[whispers] You're not
alone anymore!

640
00:37:46,683 --> 00:37:47,893
[Sara] Mister Winfield.

641
00:37:47,976 --> 00:37:50,229
I am writing to tell you
about an illicit affair

642
00:37:50,312 --> 00:37:52,356
between Elizabeth
and Jackson Smith.

643
00:37:52,481 --> 00:37:54,900
The baby is not yours.

644
00:38:02,157 --> 00:38:04,243
[Elizabeth whispers]
Where is my baby?

645
00:38:10,457 --> 00:38:11,542
[Chad] Julie?

646
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,421
[Chad] Julie!

647
00:38:18,006 --> 00:38:19,550
Keep filming.

648
00:38:20,092 --> 00:38:21,343
[Keri] Well, what is it?

649
00:38:23,178 --> 00:38:25,097
-She's here.
-[Mike] Who?

650
00:38:25,931 --> 00:38:27,850
[Mike] Who? I don't see anyone.

651
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:29,351
Elizabeth.

652
00:38:30,894 --> 00:38:32,396
She's here.

653
00:38:32,938 --> 00:38:34,439
She passed right through me.

654
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:41,613
[Mike] I don't know.
I didn't see anything.

655
00:38:42,948 --> 00:38:44,324
[Chad] I saw her in the lens

656
00:38:44,449 --> 00:38:46,201
but when I looked she was gone.

657
00:38:46,285 --> 00:38:47,578
She was there.

658
00:38:48,328 --> 00:38:49,538
[Chad] Right there! See?

659
00:38:49,955 --> 00:38:52,082
-[Mike] W- where?
-[Keri] Don't see anything.

660
00:38:52,165 --> 00:38:54,001
[Chad] Right there!
That's her head!

661
00:38:54,084 --> 00:38:55,335
[Chad] Those are arms!

662
00:38:55,419 --> 00:38:56,962
[Dean] I don't know.
It could be.

663
00:38:57,045 --> 00:38:58,255
[Mike] Could be anything.

664
00:38:58,338 --> 00:38:59,506
[Chad] I swear!

665
00:38:59,715 --> 00:39:01,675
I saw her as clear
as I'm seeing you, man!

666
00:39:01,758 --> 00:39:03,218
[Keri] It's so blurry.

667
00:39:03,552 --> 00:39:05,095
Chad?

668
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,556
Scared the shit out of me!
How can you not see it?

669
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:09,308
-[Mike] It could be whatever.
-Chad!

670
00:39:10,767 --> 00:39:12,269
Let's check everything we shot.

671
00:39:22,196 --> 00:39:23,197
[Mike] Here you go.

672
00:39:24,031 --> 00:39:25,073
I'm sorry.

673
00:39:25,157 --> 00:39:26,200
[Chad] What the fuck?

674
00:39:26,742 --> 00:39:27,743
[Mike] What?

675
00:39:28,535 --> 00:39:29,870
[Chad] Shit. Hold on.

676
00:39:33,165 --> 00:39:34,374
Shit! There's--

677
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:36,293
I don't-- I don't get this!

678
00:39:36,835 --> 00:39:37,878
[Mike] What is it?

679
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,714
[Chad] There's nothing--
we have nothing!

680
00:39:40,797 --> 00:39:42,257
-Are you sure?
-What?

681
00:39:42,341 --> 00:39:44,218
Everything we've shot is static

682
00:39:44,343 --> 00:39:45,844
except what you just saw!

683
00:39:48,347 --> 00:39:50,557
-It's bullshit.
-It's all snow.

684
00:39:50,641 --> 00:39:51,642
What'd you do?

685
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,060
Well... how can that be?

686
00:39:53,227 --> 00:39:54,520
I don't know.

687
00:39:54,686 --> 00:39:57,397
Julie, I was rolling
on everything.

688
00:39:58,148 --> 00:39:59,775
-Well...
-Then what happened?

689
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,401
-[Chad scoffs]
-What is it?

690
00:40:01,485 --> 00:40:03,237
Hang on. I'm hearing something.

691
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:05,113
[Chad] This doesn't make sense.

692
00:40:06,448 --> 00:40:07,950
-Wait, this--
-Hold on. Hold on.

693
00:40:08,116 --> 00:40:09,535
I definitely hear something.

694
00:40:10,327 --> 00:40:12,621
Is it possible to get audio
with no video?

695
00:40:13,372 --> 00:40:15,749
It could. It wasn't
programmed to do that.

696
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:18,877
We all saw
what we were just looking at.

697
00:40:18,961 --> 00:40:20,087
[Dean] Whoa!

698
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:22,047
-[Mike] What do you hear?
-[Keri] Dean?

699
00:40:22,631 --> 00:40:24,967
If there's an image I thought
there would be audio

700
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,510
even with no video. Okay?

701
00:40:26,593 --> 00:40:28,345
I boosted the bass,
cut the treble.

702
00:40:28,512 --> 00:40:30,013
I definitely heard something.

703
00:40:30,305 --> 00:40:32,099
I then put
a low pass filter on it.

704
00:40:33,725 --> 00:40:35,185
This is what I heard.

705
00:40:35,727 --> 00:40:37,729
[female whisper]
"Where is my baby?"

706
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,314
[Keri gasps] Oh my God!

707
00:40:39,648 --> 00:40:41,400
[female whisper]
"Where is my baby?"

708
00:40:51,326 --> 00:40:52,828
[Dean] Chad!

709
00:40:52,995 --> 00:40:54,371
[Dean] I know what I heard!

710
00:40:54,454 --> 00:40:56,957
I don't know. Maybe it's one of
Mike's stupid pranks.

711
00:40:57,124 --> 00:40:59,084
[Mike] No. No. No.
That one was not mine!

712
00:40:59,585 --> 00:41:01,962
And I don't know what I'm doing
with that high end

713
00:41:02,087 --> 00:41:04,214
low frequency and stuff.
I don't know.

714
00:41:05,215 --> 00:41:06,592
-He's right.
-[Mike] Besides,

715
00:41:06,675 --> 00:41:08,552
this ghost stuff
is a bunch of bullshit.

716
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:10,179
-No!
[Mike] You guys are really--

717
00:41:10,262 --> 00:41:11,722
It was her. I felt her!

718
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,140
Okay? Chad heard her!

719
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,641
We all heard her!

720
00:41:14,808 --> 00:41:16,101
It was Elizabeth.

721
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,190
And I've heard it before.

722
00:41:21,273 --> 00:41:22,941
Those words. Those same words.

723
00:41:24,776 --> 00:41:25,819
[Chad] When?

724
00:41:27,196 --> 00:41:28,822
In the cemetery.

725
00:41:29,364 --> 00:41:30,741
I-- I...

726
00:41:33,827 --> 00:41:35,579
I thought it wasn't
really happening.

727
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:37,664
Thought it wasn't real
but it was.

728
00:41:38,498 --> 00:41:39,708
[Julie] It's Elizabeth.

729
00:41:40,501 --> 00:41:41,543
[Chad] Okay.

730
00:41:42,628 --> 00:41:43,795
[Chad] It's Elizabeth.

731
00:41:45,088 --> 00:41:46,882
[Chad] That's why we
came here, right?

732
00:41:47,466 --> 00:41:49,051
[Dean] Yeah. I guess.

733
00:41:49,551 --> 00:41:50,928
We should be happy, right?

734
00:41:51,011 --> 00:41:52,346
-Yeah.
-[Chad] And we

735
00:41:53,055 --> 00:41:55,974
got ourselves
a real ghost on film.

736
00:41:56,892 --> 00:41:58,519
God damn it!
That's-- that's crazy!

737
00:41:58,685 --> 00:42:00,979
Here's to us, for getting
the ghost on film, huh?

738
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,316
Okay guys. Let's just take
a look at everything we shot.

739
00:42:04,942 --> 00:42:06,485
Maybe we got more weird stuff...

740
00:42:06,652 --> 00:42:08,403
[loud supernatural noises]

741
00:42:08,612 --> 00:42:11,490
maybe entice it to
make another appearance?

742
00:42:12,366 --> 00:42:13,367
[Chad] All right.

743
00:42:13,534 --> 00:42:15,160
Well, if you guys don't need me

744
00:42:15,244 --> 00:42:17,079
I think I'm going to
go down to the bar

745
00:42:17,204 --> 00:42:20,040
and just pretend that I'm not
in a ghost hotel.

746
00:42:20,165 --> 00:42:22,459
-[Chad] Sounds good to me!
-[Dean] Are you in?

747
00:42:22,584 --> 00:42:23,669
Oh! I am in!

748
00:42:23,752 --> 00:42:24,753
[Dean] Keri?

749
00:42:25,587 --> 00:42:26,964
[Keri scoffs] Fine.

750
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,841
[Dean] All right.

751
00:42:29,132 --> 00:42:30,551
[Dean] See you guys in a bit.

752
00:42:35,764 --> 00:42:38,851
[Keri] Where are we going now
with an angry ghost-- Stop it!

753
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:41,311
-[Mike chuckles]
-[Keri] It's not funny anymore.

754
00:42:42,145 --> 00:42:43,897
[Mike] Sorry, ghosts
only tickle you.

755
00:42:44,022 --> 00:42:45,274
[Keri gasps] Oh my God!

756
00:42:45,357 --> 00:42:46,358
Guys!

757
00:42:46,483 --> 00:42:47,609
[Mike laughs]

758
00:42:47,693 --> 00:42:49,111
[Keri] You know I'm ticklish!

759
00:42:58,453 --> 00:42:59,663
That's a nice necklace.

760
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:01,790
Thanks.

761
00:43:02,457 --> 00:43:03,709
What's inside the locket?

762
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:06,670
Uhm, it's just an old picture.

763
00:43:09,339 --> 00:43:10,591
Of? [chuckles]

764
00:43:16,388 --> 00:43:18,223
I always thought
it was my grandmother.

765
00:43:19,391 --> 00:43:20,809
You don't think that anymore?

766
00:43:22,477 --> 00:43:23,645
I don't know.

767
00:43:27,816 --> 00:43:29,151
Okay. Explain the whole

768
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:32,112
"I felt Elizabeth as she passed
right through me" bit.

769
00:43:32,446 --> 00:43:33,947
I know it sounds crazy.

770
00:43:35,115 --> 00:43:37,743
Not as crazy as anything
else we are doing here, right?

771
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:46,001
I just-- I feel
everything in this place.

772
00:43:46,877 --> 00:43:49,338
I see things. I see--

773
00:43:50,047 --> 00:43:53,050
I see Elizabeth
and I see George, and

774
00:43:53,133 --> 00:43:54,676
Jackson Smith.

775
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:58,096
It's like they were-- it's like
I'm right there with them.

776
00:44:00,474 --> 00:44:01,725
I can't really explain it.

777
00:44:05,771 --> 00:44:07,147
Okay.

778
00:44:07,773 --> 00:44:09,983
Well your grandma
worked here, right?

779
00:44:10,817 --> 00:44:13,737
So that's a distant connection.

780
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:17,574
So at least there's a connection
there somewhere.

781
00:44:21,828 --> 00:44:23,872
So you're especially attuned
to this place.

782
00:44:24,706 --> 00:44:25,832
That's it.

783
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:28,377
I mean if I can
believe in ghosts

784
00:44:29,127 --> 00:44:31,088
I sure as hell can
believe in all of that.

785
00:44:33,882 --> 00:44:35,092
Thanks.

786
00:44:35,926 --> 00:44:37,469
You always know what to say.

787
00:44:37,845 --> 00:44:39,179
Yeah. I'm great like that.

788
00:44:39,429 --> 00:44:40,848
[Julie giggles]

789
00:44:42,891 --> 00:44:45,352
So, what do you say we scare up
some more ghosts?

790
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:47,354
Are you sure?

791
00:44:47,479 --> 00:44:49,356
Yeah. We can always
look at this footage

792
00:44:49,439 --> 00:44:51,191
but we'll only be here
a couple days.

793
00:44:51,275 --> 00:44:53,569
We might as well
get some stuff on film.

794
00:44:54,611 --> 00:44:56,780
You're the boss. Let's do it.

795
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:07,124
[Dean laughing]

796
00:45:07,207 --> 00:45:08,959
Chad said
something different but

797
00:45:09,042 --> 00:45:10,627
I don't know. It went too fast.

798
00:45:11,044 --> 00:45:13,172
-[Chad] Not that funny, Mike
-[Keri laughing]

799
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:16,884
-Yo! Lady Producer!
-[Julie] Hi honey.

800
00:45:16,967 --> 00:45:18,844
-Ready to find Elizabeth?
-Sounds good!

801
00:45:19,011 --> 00:45:20,596
[Keri] Okay but I'm telling you

802
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:22,431
I don't want to go back
in that room.

803
00:45:22,598 --> 00:45:24,057
It's like totally scary.

804
00:45:24,141 --> 00:45:25,601
Well, you don't have to then.

805
00:45:25,684 --> 00:45:28,061
You can hang out here or
hang out in the room.

806
00:45:28,228 --> 00:45:29,605
Uhm... no!

807
00:45:29,688 --> 00:45:31,148
I'm not gonna be by myself.

808
00:45:31,315 --> 00:45:33,233
Okay. You're being
a little difficult.

809
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:35,152
-[Chad chuckles]
-[Keri] I don't care!

810
00:45:35,319 --> 00:45:37,279
This place is
totally freaking me out!

811
00:45:37,362 --> 00:45:38,530
You don't need to be.

812
00:45:38,614 --> 00:45:40,657
[Mike] You need me
chasing ghosts with you?

813
00:45:40,741 --> 00:45:42,201
No. I mean, we're okay.

814
00:45:42,618 --> 00:45:43,827
All right. So we're cool.

815
00:45:43,911 --> 00:45:45,621
I'm going to stay here with Keri

816
00:45:45,704 --> 00:45:46,955
you go get your work done.

817
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:48,040
Everybody happy?

818
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:49,958
Sounds good to me.

819
00:45:50,542 --> 00:45:51,793
So, we're cool?

820
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,337
Sweetie?

821
00:45:53,587 --> 00:45:56,965
Okay. I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be such a pain.

822
00:45:57,132 --> 00:45:58,133
It's okay.

823
00:45:58,342 --> 00:45:59,551
Everybody's used to it.

824
00:45:59,676 --> 00:46:00,928
[chuckles]

825
00:46:01,762 --> 00:46:03,764
Come on Chad.
Let's go grab some stuff.

826
00:46:06,058 --> 00:46:07,309
Catch some ghosts.

827
00:46:07,392 --> 00:46:08,602
See you soon!

828
00:46:10,103 --> 00:46:11,355
All right Keri dog!

829
00:46:11,438 --> 00:46:13,815
In order to keep
this party moving

830
00:46:13,899 --> 00:46:15,275
we're going to...

831
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:16,860
Ah!

832
00:46:16,944 --> 00:46:19,446
have to head upstairs
and make a little excursion to

833
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:22,032
continue on with our libation.

834
00:46:22,115 --> 00:46:23,325
Lead on!

835
00:46:25,035 --> 00:46:26,036
[giggles]

836
00:46:35,879 --> 00:46:38,006
What kind of hotel
doesn't have cable T.V.?

837
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:39,466
[Mike] I know. Seriously.

838
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:41,927
We could be watching
pay per view porno right now.

839
00:46:42,094 --> 00:46:43,303
[Keri chuckles]
Oh my God!

840
00:46:43,387 --> 00:46:45,138
-You're so gross!
-[Mike chuckles]

841
00:46:54,982 --> 00:46:56,942
[Julie] A little while ago
in this room

842
00:46:57,025 --> 00:46:58,193
we had a first encounter

843
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,153
with resident ghost
Elizabeth Walker.

844
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,907
We don't know the significance
of this room.

845
00:47:04,074 --> 00:47:05,367
Maybe this is where

846
00:47:05,492 --> 00:47:08,161
George Winfield first learned
of her unfaithfulness?

847
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:11,957
Or maybe just a room that
Elizabeth particularly liked.

848
00:47:13,125 --> 00:47:15,002
But last time we were here

849
00:47:15,544 --> 00:47:17,713
temperature dropped
considerably.

850
00:47:19,381 --> 00:47:20,507
Now there's--

851
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:24,011
there's nothing on
the EMF scanner.

852
00:47:24,219 --> 00:47:25,637
No ghostly activity.

853
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,934
I'm not getting anything.

854
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:35,105
I know. Last time
we could feel her presence.

855
00:47:36,064 --> 00:47:37,232
So, where to next?

856
00:47:38,275 --> 00:47:39,651
Just cut to the chase.

857
00:47:40,235 --> 00:47:41,653
Let's go to room 109.

858
00:47:48,952 --> 00:47:50,120
[Keri] Whoa! Whoa!

859
00:47:50,621 --> 00:47:52,039
[Keri] Slow down!

860
00:47:52,331 --> 00:47:53,790
I can handle it.

861
00:47:53,957 --> 00:47:55,792
I can handle it just fine.
Thank you.

862
00:47:56,126 --> 00:47:58,253
That is true!

863
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:00,297
[giggles] Hey!

864
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:02,090
[Keri] Can't you share? Come on!

865
00:48:04,134 --> 00:48:05,636
-[Mike chuckles]
-[Keri squeals]

866
00:48:05,719 --> 00:48:07,221
I keep doing that!

867
00:48:07,304 --> 00:48:10,015
[Mike laughing] Yeah, that's
a really good look for you.

868
00:48:26,657 --> 00:48:28,575
[Dean] It's so dark down here.

869
00:48:30,369 --> 00:48:32,329
[Dean] Here, let's go
down this hallway.

870
00:48:32,996 --> 00:48:34,414
[beeping]

871
00:48:35,666 --> 00:48:36,750
[Julie] It's her!

872
00:48:36,917 --> 00:48:38,794
[Julie] Oh, my God!
Oh my God! It's her!

873
00:48:39,753 --> 00:48:41,296
[Chad] Where's she taking us?

874
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:44,967
[whispering]
Come to me if you dare!

875
00:48:45,801 --> 00:48:46,927
[Julie] Follow her!

876
00:48:47,886 --> 00:48:49,763
[Dean] Chad, get out the camera.

877
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:53,642
[Chad] What the heck is that?

878
00:48:54,184 --> 00:48:55,769
[Julie] It's a real ghost.

879
00:48:56,144 --> 00:48:57,771
[Julie] Where's she going?

880
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,568
[Julie] I think
that's Elizabeth.

881
00:49:04,653 --> 00:49:06,613
[Julie] Chad,
are you getting this?

882
00:49:07,781 --> 00:49:10,117
[whispering] Come to me.

883
00:49:11,076 --> 00:49:13,704
[Julie] Hey guys, where
do you think she's leading us?

884
00:49:14,454 --> 00:49:16,915
-[Mike chuckles]
-[Keri] You're such a spazz!

885
00:49:17,082 --> 00:49:18,834
[Mike] You know...
you're really hot!

886
00:49:19,418 --> 00:49:22,129
[Keri giggles] Well, duh!

887
00:49:22,212 --> 00:49:23,505
I'm serious.

888
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:25,090
-[Keri] Really?
-Yeah.

889
00:49:26,925 --> 00:49:28,260
[giggles]

890
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:36,685
[Dean] Did you guys see the same
thing that I saw down there?

891
00:49:37,895 --> 00:49:39,188
[Chad] Holy shit, guys!

892
00:49:39,271 --> 00:49:41,523
[Dean] Wait until Keri and Mike
hear about this.

893
00:49:43,734 --> 00:49:45,777
Whoa! It's cold.

894
00:49:46,236 --> 00:49:48,238
Whoa! It's freezing.

895
00:49:49,656 --> 00:49:51,909
I think something's happening.
You should film.

896
00:49:52,034 --> 00:49:53,535
You got it, boss!

897
00:49:54,703 --> 00:49:55,746
[Julie] Hey.

898
00:49:56,288 --> 00:49:57,748
What you think happened there?

899
00:49:57,831 --> 00:49:59,208
Did we do that?

900
00:49:59,541 --> 00:50:02,044
[beeping]

901
00:50:06,798 --> 00:50:08,759
[Chad] That door ain't
always been opened.

902
00:50:19,811 --> 00:50:21,647
Jesus. It's freezing in here.

903
00:50:26,443 --> 00:50:29,154
[Keri giggles]
You're such a spazz!

904
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:34,076
[Keri moans]

905
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,919
[Keri moans louder]
[Mike] Are you all right?

906
00:50:44,294 --> 00:50:45,963
How hot am I?

907
00:50:46,046 --> 00:50:47,840
[Mike chuckles]
You're really hot!

908
00:50:48,048 --> 00:50:51,009
[Mike] Very hot!
Everyone knows that Keri!

909
00:50:51,635 --> 00:50:53,762
Show me.

910
00:50:56,139 --> 00:50:58,392
[beeping]

911
00:51:08,151 --> 00:51:10,112
Should have been mine.

912
00:51:23,041 --> 00:51:25,335
Why'd you do it, Sara?
Why'd you do it?

913
00:51:25,794 --> 00:51:26,837
Jackson.

914
00:51:27,337 --> 00:51:29,423
[Sara] Don't know
what you're talking about.

915
00:51:32,926 --> 00:51:34,428
Why did you do it?

916
00:51:37,681 --> 00:51:38,724
I didn't do anything.

917
00:51:38,849 --> 00:51:40,142
I don't know what
you mean.

918
00:51:40,267 --> 00:51:41,268
Don't lie!

919
00:51:41,393 --> 00:51:42,853
Not here in her room!

920
00:51:48,317 --> 00:51:49,318
Why?

921
00:51:51,778 --> 00:51:53,197
You're drunk.

922
00:51:53,405 --> 00:51:54,740
Yes. I am drunk.

923
00:51:57,618 --> 00:51:58,994
[Jackson] And you know why?

924
00:51:59,328 --> 00:52:04,333
Because that bastard, Winfield,
killed my beautiful Elizabeth.

925
00:52:05,584 --> 00:52:10,589
And he killed my
two week old baby.

926
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:17,179
How could you kill something
so innocent?

927
00:52:17,804 --> 00:52:19,264
[Jackson] So perfect?

928
00:52:21,767 --> 00:52:24,603
Were you jealous that I wouldn't
come to your bed?

929
00:52:25,979 --> 00:52:28,106
Is that why you want
to hurt me so much?

930
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,608
Get out!

931
00:52:37,366 --> 00:52:38,784
A curse on you!

932
00:52:39,743 --> 00:52:41,662
A curse on you
and your whole family!

933
00:52:41,745 --> 00:52:43,247
From this time onward

934
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:45,791
May God forgive you
because I never will!

935
00:52:46,834 --> 00:52:48,043
A curse on you!

936
00:52:49,211 --> 00:52:51,046
A curse on you
and your whole family!

937
00:52:51,171 --> 00:52:52,381
[Chad] Julie?

938
00:52:52,881 --> 00:52:54,007
[Chad] Julie?

939
00:52:55,008 --> 00:52:56,468
It's my fault.

940
00:52:57,427 --> 00:53:00,305
It's my fault that Elizabeth
and that baby died.

941
00:53:00,389 --> 00:53:02,349
[Dean] What?
What are you talking about?

942
00:53:04,309 --> 00:53:07,020
I saw something that I
never should have seen.

943
00:53:08,438 --> 00:53:10,107
Help me get her
back to the room.

944
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:11,233
[Dean] Okay.

945
00:53:11,692 --> 00:53:15,654
-[Keri breathing heavily]
-[Mike moans]

946
00:53:21,243 --> 00:53:24,830
[moaning]

947
00:53:34,923 --> 00:53:37,676
[moaning intensifies]

948
00:53:58,363 --> 00:53:59,364
[Julie gasps]

949
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:01,116
Jesus Christ!

950
00:54:03,493 --> 00:54:05,495
[moaning]

951
00:54:08,081 --> 00:54:09,875
What the hell, Keri?

952
00:54:12,753 --> 00:54:14,171
Oh!

953
00:54:14,505 --> 00:54:16,256
I don't know! Wait!

954
00:54:16,715 --> 00:54:18,550
-[Keri cries]
-Keri!

955
00:54:19,801 --> 00:54:21,595
-I don't even know--
-Shut up!

956
00:54:22,054 --> 00:54:23,639
Know what?
You're always flirting!

957
00:54:23,722 --> 00:54:25,474
Always saying stuff.
I always thought

958
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:27,184
You know what? That's just Mike!

959
00:54:27,267 --> 00:54:28,644
I didn't-- Oh, fuck!

960
00:54:28,727 --> 00:54:30,270
We really know how to pick them!

961
00:54:30,354 --> 00:54:32,272
-[Chad] Let's call it--
-I don't even--

962
00:54:32,356 --> 00:54:34,233
Why the hell would you
do that to me?

963
00:54:34,316 --> 00:54:35,734
You don't understand!

964
00:54:35,901 --> 00:54:37,319
I don't know what happened!

965
00:54:37,402 --> 00:54:39,279
We were sitting here
talking, drinking--

966
00:54:39,404 --> 00:54:41,698
And you just accidentally
slipped inside of her?

967
00:54:43,283 --> 00:54:44,952
You're such an asshole!

968
00:54:46,453 --> 00:54:47,871
Dude! You got to believe me!

969
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,749
I swear we were just talking
and I- I-

970
00:54:50,874 --> 00:54:52,835
It was the weirdest thing ever!

971
00:54:53,836 --> 00:54:54,878
Yeah. Sure.

972
00:54:55,295 --> 00:54:57,965
Okay. I know it sounds weird
and I'm kind of drunk

973
00:54:58,048 --> 00:55:00,509
but it was not her!
It was like it was someone else!

974
00:55:00,634 --> 00:55:01,635
[Mike] Okay?

975
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:02,928
Mike!

976
00:55:03,011 --> 00:55:04,304
Stop drinking! Okay?

977
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:05,722
Do that. Please?

978
00:55:05,806 --> 00:55:07,516
Chad! Come on!
You gotta believe me!

979
00:55:07,641 --> 00:55:10,018
Make sure Jules is okay!

980
00:55:11,144 --> 00:55:12,980
Oh, fuck.

981
00:55:13,313 --> 00:55:14,773
[sighs]

982
00:55:17,067 --> 00:55:20,445
[Keri panting]

983
00:55:32,082 --> 00:55:34,626
Oh, my God!

984
00:55:37,254 --> 00:55:38,463
Keri!

985
00:55:41,925 --> 00:55:45,637
[Keri panting]

986
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:59,401
[Keri crying]

987
00:56:11,747 --> 00:56:13,916
[busy dial tone]

988
00:56:14,791 --> 00:56:16,710
Oh, my god!

989
00:56:28,514 --> 00:56:29,765
[Chad] Julie?

990
00:56:32,726 --> 00:56:34,895
Please just don't try
to defend him.

991
00:56:36,396 --> 00:56:37,689
I'm not trying to.

992
00:56:38,148 --> 00:56:39,691
He's such an asshole.

993
00:56:41,109 --> 00:56:42,694
Yeah. He is an asshole

994
00:56:44,821 --> 00:56:47,491
but I don't think he's
this big of an asshole, do you?

995
00:56:48,575 --> 00:56:52,120
I didn't think so.
And with Keri?

996
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:55,290
I mean how could this happen?

997
00:56:56,416 --> 00:56:57,751
It's this place.

998
00:56:58,502 --> 00:57:01,046
The hotel is doing things to us.

999
00:57:03,882 --> 00:57:06,760
I saw Elizabeth.

1000
00:57:10,222 --> 00:57:12,975
I saw my grandmother
betray Elizabeth.

1001
00:57:14,351 --> 00:57:15,686
But it wasn't her.

1002
00:57:16,728 --> 00:57:18,272
It was me.

1003
00:57:19,398 --> 00:57:20,899
What else did you see?

1004
00:57:25,112 --> 00:57:26,655
I saw

1005
00:57:27,489 --> 00:57:29,533
my grandmother flirting with

1006
00:57:29,616 --> 00:57:32,369
[sniffs] with Jackson Smith and

1007
00:57:34,454 --> 00:57:36,874
I saw her spying on Elizabeth.

1008
00:57:40,669 --> 00:57:42,671
Spying on them being intimate.

1009
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:44,631
[sniffs]

1010
00:57:48,385 --> 00:57:52,181
But it wasn't-- it wasn't
them. It was me!

1011
00:57:58,478 --> 00:58:00,189
Fuck you guys.

1012
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:05,277
This is bullshit!

1013
00:58:07,529 --> 00:58:08,739
Fucking whore!

1014
00:58:08,906 --> 00:58:09,948
[whispering] Michael?

1015
00:58:10,199 --> 00:58:12,075
[Mike] Come out
you fucking ghosts!

1016
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:14,828
[whispering] Come to me Michael.

1017
00:58:17,372 --> 00:58:19,041
[whispering] Michael?

1018
00:58:24,087 --> 00:58:26,131
[Keri] Oh, God.

1019
00:58:32,596 --> 00:58:35,307
[Keri squealing scared]

1020
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,900
[whispering] You're first.

1021
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:48,362
[Keri] Dean?

1022
00:58:52,282 --> 00:58:53,951
[Keri screaming] Dean!

1023
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:57,162
It was me. It was me who...

1024
00:58:59,248 --> 00:59:01,041
betrayed them.

1025
00:59:02,501 --> 00:59:04,503
It was me who killed them.

1026
00:59:04,586 --> 00:59:07,840
Julie. Julie, you've gotta
stop this! It wasn't you!

1027
00:59:08,924 --> 00:59:10,467
All right? It was
your grandmother.

1028
00:59:12,094 --> 00:59:15,180
You're connected to this place
but it's not your fault.

1029
00:59:16,014 --> 00:59:18,016
You didn't kill them.

1030
00:59:21,895 --> 00:59:23,939
This locket is Elizabeth's.

1031
00:59:25,065 --> 00:59:27,401
Jackson Smith gave it to her.

1032
00:59:29,319 --> 00:59:31,029
This is their baby.

1033
00:59:35,617 --> 00:59:38,495
My grandmother stole it
after she was dead.

1034
00:59:39,371 --> 00:59:41,456
That's why she doesn't
want us in Goldfield.

1035
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:42,708
She's ashamed.

1036
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:44,960
I'm ashamed.

1037
00:59:49,047 --> 00:59:51,633
I'm ashamed to be a part
of this whole thing.

1038
00:59:58,307 --> 01:00:01,018
Whoa! Whoa! Wait! Wait! Wait!

1039
01:00:01,101 --> 01:00:02,477
Don't you see?

1040
01:00:03,562 --> 01:00:06,106
You have a chance to make things
right with Elizabeth.

1041
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:13,697
We can give her her locket
and the picture of her baby.

1042
01:00:14,281 --> 01:00:15,949
I mean I don't know.

1043
01:00:16,742 --> 01:00:20,454
Maybe-- maybe I'm way off base
here but...

1044
01:00:23,624 --> 01:00:25,167
we can give Elizabeth

1045
01:00:26,752 --> 01:00:28,712
the peace she deserves.

1046
01:00:30,839 --> 01:00:32,799
Chad, how are you so smart?

1047
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:38,722
It's a curse I guess.

1048
01:00:38,805 --> 01:00:43,352
Instead of the looks
and the charm I got brains.

1049
01:00:44,937 --> 01:00:46,647
I can live with it, right?

1050
01:00:47,397 --> 01:00:50,359
Yeah. You're the whole package.

1051
01:00:51,944 --> 01:00:53,278
I always knew that.

1052
01:00:53,362 --> 01:00:56,281
I was just too stupid
to do anything about it.

1053
01:00:57,783 --> 01:00:59,910
Julie?

1054
01:01:01,203 --> 01:01:03,330
I've cared about--

1055
01:01:19,888 --> 01:01:20,889
[Dean] Keri!

1056
01:01:23,016 --> 01:01:24,226
[Keri] Dean!

1057
01:01:36,405 --> 01:01:37,531
[Keri gasps]

1058
01:01:38,198 --> 01:01:39,616
[Keri] Dean!

1059
01:01:40,701 --> 01:01:42,536
[Keri] Please find me!

1060
01:01:43,495 --> 01:01:44,913
[Keri] Dean?

1061
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:51,295
[Dean] Keri!

1062
01:01:51,461 --> 01:01:53,547
[Keri] I'm here! Come get me!

1063
01:01:55,257 --> 01:01:56,300
[Dean] Keri?

1064
01:01:57,342 --> 01:01:58,969
Where the hell are you?

1065
01:02:03,432 --> 01:02:04,516
[Keri] Dean?

1066
01:02:12,316 --> 01:02:13,650
[Keri] Dean?

1067
01:02:30,125 --> 01:02:31,793
[Keri panting]

1068
01:02:35,756 --> 01:02:38,217
Dean!

1069
01:02:38,592 --> 01:02:40,260
[crying]

1070
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:42,221
[Keri screams]

1071
01:02:42,471 --> 01:02:43,764
Keri! I'm coming!

1072
01:02:46,141 --> 01:02:48,477
[whispering] You're first.

1073
01:02:48,727 --> 01:02:50,354
[Keri screams]

1074
01:03:18,757 --> 01:03:20,551
[whispering] Do you like me?

1075
01:03:25,889 --> 01:03:28,225
You're not George!

1076
01:03:40,237 --> 01:03:43,240
[Elizabeth] How do you
like this, Michael?

1077
01:03:43,323 --> 01:03:44,533
Oh, God.

1078
01:03:44,992 --> 01:03:47,244
[coughs]

1079
01:03:51,331 --> 01:03:52,541
You're not Jules.

1080
01:03:53,542 --> 01:03:54,668
Where is everyone?

1081
01:03:54,751 --> 01:03:56,295
-[Elizabeth] Michael.
-Hey, guys!

1082
01:03:56,461 --> 01:03:58,547
[Elizabeth] Come to me, Michael.

1083
01:03:58,755 --> 01:03:59,756
Oh shit!

1084
01:03:59,882 --> 01:04:01,049
[Elizabeth] Michael.

1085
01:04:02,217 --> 01:04:03,385
You want a drink?

1086
01:04:04,386 --> 01:04:05,387
No?

1087
01:04:05,596 --> 01:04:06,638
Whoa!

1088
01:04:06,722 --> 01:04:07,890
Whoa! Hey!

1089
01:04:08,015 --> 01:04:09,892
I don't fuck
dead chicks, all right?

1090
01:04:11,185 --> 01:04:13,061
No, seriously. I mean it.

1091
01:04:13,228 --> 01:04:15,606
Just go on. Go find
your dead baby or some shit.

1092
01:04:15,689 --> 01:04:16,815
Scram!

1093
01:04:17,858 --> 01:04:19,443
[groaning]

1094
01:04:45,761 --> 01:04:47,387
[Dean] Keri?

1095
01:05:23,966 --> 01:05:25,384
Was that the hotel too?

1096
01:05:25,884 --> 01:05:27,636
That was-- that was all me.

1097
01:05:28,637 --> 01:05:31,431
I've been wanting to do that
for as long as I've known you.

1098
01:05:35,561 --> 01:05:37,229
[Dean] Chad! Julie!

1099
01:05:41,066 --> 01:05:42,067
[Julie screeches]

1100
01:05:42,234 --> 01:05:44,111
-I found her backpack.
-[Julie] My God!

1101
01:05:44,194 --> 01:05:46,154
We were yelling at each other

1102
01:05:46,238 --> 01:05:48,198
and now she's gone.
I don't know where.

1103
01:05:48,365 --> 01:05:50,075
Let's check on Mike!

1104
01:06:02,212 --> 01:06:03,589
[Julie screams]

1105
01:06:08,051 --> 01:06:09,553
[Dean] All right.

1106
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:15,642
[Chad] Dean! No!
We need to stick together!

1107
01:06:15,726 --> 01:06:16,852
Wait!

1108
01:06:16,935 --> 01:06:17,936
Damn it! Dean!

1109
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:19,479
[Chad] We need to go get him!

1110
01:06:19,563 --> 01:06:20,689
[Julie] No! Wait!

1111
01:06:20,772 --> 01:06:22,649
Julie! We have to go
help him find Keri!

1112
01:06:22,733 --> 01:06:23,901
Wait!

1113
01:06:24,067 --> 01:06:26,778
Okay, maybe we need
to do something else right now!

1114
01:06:26,862 --> 01:06:27,988
What?

1115
01:06:28,071 --> 01:06:29,907
If it's Elizabeth,
we need to stop her.

1116
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:31,742
How are we going to do that?

1117
01:06:32,284 --> 01:06:33,493
Maybe it's like you said?

1118
01:06:35,037 --> 01:06:36,413
Maybe if we give her...

1119
01:06:37,372 --> 01:06:38,874
the locket she will be at peace?

1120
01:06:38,957 --> 01:06:40,167
Maybe it's not!

1121
01:06:41,835 --> 01:06:43,545
We have to try.

1122
01:06:43,921 --> 01:06:45,589
Maybe this is all
part of my family.

1123
01:06:45,672 --> 01:06:47,049
I have to do this.

1124
01:06:50,052 --> 01:06:51,053
Okay.

1125
01:06:51,595 --> 01:06:52,638
What do we do?

1126
01:06:54,139 --> 01:06:55,557
[Julie] Room 109.

1127
01:06:57,267 --> 01:06:58,519
Come on.

1128
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:20,916
Sure you want to do this?

1129
01:07:20,999 --> 01:07:22,292
I have to.

1130
01:07:31,051 --> 01:07:32,678
What did you do to her,
you bitch!

1131
01:07:33,595 --> 01:07:34,930
Show yourself!

1132
01:07:39,101 --> 01:07:41,603
[Elizabeth] Yes.

1133
01:07:41,728 --> 01:07:44,022
[Elizabeth] Yes.

1134
01:07:47,609 --> 01:07:49,361
[Elizabeth] Yes.

1135
01:07:55,993 --> 01:07:59,037
[Elizabeth] Dean. You're next!

1136
01:08:03,083 --> 01:08:04,251
[Dean yelling] Chad?

1137
01:08:06,003 --> 01:08:07,671
Julie! Chad! Let me in!

1138
01:08:07,796 --> 01:08:09,006
Hurry!

1139
01:08:09,214 --> 01:08:10,424
Let me in!

1140
01:08:10,632 --> 01:08:11,925
Ah! It's locked!

1141
01:08:12,134 --> 01:08:13,719
Let me in!

1142
01:08:13,802 --> 01:08:14,928
Julie!

1143
01:08:15,012 --> 01:08:16,054
Chad!

1144
01:08:16,972 --> 01:08:19,224
Let me in! Open the door!

1145
01:08:21,643 --> 01:08:22,728
It's locked!

1146
01:08:23,812 --> 01:08:24,813
[snarls]

1147
01:08:25,147 --> 01:08:27,149
[screams]

1148
01:08:29,610 --> 01:08:31,528
[Elizabeth] Come back!

1149
01:08:39,745 --> 01:08:41,079
[Julie] This is the room.

1150
01:08:41,163 --> 01:08:42,581
[Chad] Where she died.

1151
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,588
[Julie] Elizabeth?

1152
01:08:52,716 --> 01:08:54,718
Elizabeth,
I have something for you.

1153
01:09:01,225 --> 01:09:02,684
It's rightfully yours.

1154
01:09:03,852 --> 01:09:06,021
Please take it
and just leave us alone?

1155
01:09:15,155 --> 01:09:17,449
[gasps in dismay]

1156
01:09:59,783 --> 01:10:01,285
Here's your baby, bitch!

1157
01:10:01,410 --> 01:10:02,911
[Elizabeth gasps]

1158
01:10:12,629 --> 01:10:14,756
You cheap Bitch! Come here!

1159
01:10:16,383 --> 01:10:17,801
Cheap Bitch!

1160
01:10:20,846 --> 01:10:22,723
What have I done Elizabeth?

1161
01:10:23,849 --> 01:10:25,184
I love you.

1162
01:10:26,018 --> 01:10:27,769
I've always loved you!

1163
01:10:29,938 --> 01:10:31,523
But that wasn't good enough!

1164
01:10:34,902 --> 01:10:37,863
You made me, George Winfield,
look like a dope!

1165
01:10:40,199 --> 01:10:41,783
[Windfield] You're going to die.

1166
01:10:41,909 --> 01:10:43,493
[Elizabeth crying loudly]

1167
01:10:45,037 --> 01:10:46,997
You're going to die.

1168
01:10:52,002 --> 01:10:56,673
[grunting]

1169
01:10:57,424 --> 01:10:58,926
[Windfield]
You're gonna die.

1170
01:10:59,426 --> 01:11:02,346
[Elizabeth screams] No! George!

1171
01:11:07,976 --> 01:11:10,062
I never want to be
in that room again.

1172
01:11:12,606 --> 01:11:13,774
What should we do?

1173
01:11:15,275 --> 01:11:16,610
I don't know.

1174
01:11:17,528 --> 01:11:19,196
Elizabeth can't be freed.

1175
01:11:19,279 --> 01:11:20,531
What do you mean?

1176
01:11:22,115 --> 01:11:23,659
I can't imagine the--

1177
01:11:24,368 --> 01:11:26,328
the cruelty she
went through. The--

1178
01:11:26,578 --> 01:11:29,122
that night at the hands
of George Winfield.

1179
01:11:29,456 --> 01:11:31,542
All I saw was revenge.

1180
01:11:35,546 --> 01:11:36,755
What do we do now then?

1181
01:11:41,134 --> 01:11:42,636
Keri!

1182
01:11:43,387 --> 01:11:46,515
[Elizabeth] Who are you
looking for?

1183
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:47,766
[Elizabeth] Keri?

1184
01:11:54,523 --> 01:11:56,692
[Elizabeth] Want some head Dean?

1185
01:11:56,775 --> 01:11:58,485
[screams]

1186
01:12:04,074 --> 01:12:06,660
[grunts]

1187
01:12:16,712 --> 01:12:17,921
[screams]

1188
01:12:19,923 --> 01:12:21,425
[Julie] Let's find them and go.

1189
01:12:21,550 --> 01:12:23,760
-What if we don't find them?
-Then we get help!

1190
01:12:24,052 --> 01:12:25,596
-Dean!
-[Julie screams]

1191
01:12:25,804 --> 01:12:26,805
[Chad] Dean!

1192
01:12:26,930 --> 01:12:27,931
[Chad] Dean!

1193
01:12:30,017 --> 01:12:31,268
[Chad] Come on!

1194
01:12:31,351 --> 01:12:33,353
[Julie continues screaming]
Oh my God!

1195
01:12:34,938 --> 01:12:35,939
[Chad] Keri!

1196
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:38,317
Come on!

1197
01:12:38,817 --> 01:12:40,235
[Julie] Please, help us!

1198
01:12:43,030 --> 01:12:45,199
[Julie] Please!

1199
01:12:45,824 --> 01:12:48,076
[Chad panting]
Let's find another way.

1200
01:12:53,498 --> 01:12:54,833
[Julie screams]

1201
01:12:55,375 --> 01:12:58,462
[Elizabeth growling]

1202
01:13:04,968 --> 01:13:07,012
[Elizabeth] Where's my baby?

1203
01:13:32,412 --> 01:13:35,123
I can do this.

1204
01:13:36,124 --> 01:13:37,709
It's my fault.

1205
01:13:42,714 --> 01:13:44,633
This is all my fault.

1206
01:13:50,305 --> 01:13:52,808
I don't know what to do.

1207
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:54,268
I don't know what to do.

1208
01:13:55,352 --> 01:13:56,353
I don't know.

1209
01:15:20,854 --> 01:15:21,980
Elizabeth?

1210
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:24,441
[Julie] I'm here.

1211
01:15:24,691 --> 01:15:26,109
[Julie] Come out.

1212
01:15:34,409 --> 01:15:36,245
[Elizabeth whispering]
Where's my baby?

1213
01:15:36,662 --> 01:15:39,081
[Elizabeth whispers]
Where's my baby?

1214
01:15:39,873 --> 01:15:41,416
I'm who you want, aren't I?

1215
01:15:41,625 --> 01:15:43,126
[whispering] Where's my baby?

1216
01:15:43,252 --> 01:15:45,170
[Julie] I'm the one
who betrayed you.

1217
01:15:47,464 --> 01:15:49,800
Well I have something
that you want.

1218
01:15:50,008 --> 01:15:52,761
[Elizabeth whispers repeatedly]
Where's my baby?

1219
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:01,603
[Elizabeth] My baby!

1220
01:16:01,854 --> 01:16:04,314
This is what you've been
searching for isn't it?

1221
01:16:06,316 --> 01:16:07,860
Well, I have it.

1222
01:16:08,652 --> 01:16:11,321
and as long as I have it,
you can't touch me, can you?

1223
01:16:13,198 --> 01:16:18,412
[Julie] So you killed the others
because you couldn't get to me.

1224
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:26,128
I know that you're trapped here
where you relive your death.

1225
01:16:28,839 --> 01:16:32,384
I know that this will free you.

1226
01:16:35,721 --> 01:16:37,055
Just go!

1227
01:16:37,973 --> 01:16:39,725
Don't hurt anyone else.

1228
01:16:40,976 --> 01:16:41,977
[gasps]

1229
01:16:52,154 --> 01:16:53,363
[Julie screams]

1230
01:17:02,998 --> 01:17:05,334
[Elizabeth] Where's my baby?

1231
01:17:05,584 --> 01:17:07,794
[Elizabeth] Where's my baby?

1232
01:17:18,639 --> 01:17:22,726
[Julie] No! No! Get away!
Get away from me!

1233
01:17:26,939 --> 01:17:29,191
Why won't you get away?

1234
01:17:31,693 --> 01:17:33,529
[Elizabeth] He will come
for you now.

1235
01:17:39,284 --> 01:17:43,121
[Julie] Stay away!
Stay away from me!

1236
01:17:44,581 --> 01:17:46,166
[Julie] Let me go!

1237
01:17:46,458 --> 01:17:48,460
[Julie] Please stay away!

1238
01:17:49,002 --> 01:17:50,879
[Julie] Stay away from me!

1239
01:17:51,171 --> 01:17:54,466
[Julie] Help me! Help me!
Help me!

1240
01:17:56,718 --> 01:17:59,763
[Sophie] Chad! Chad!
My hands. Hurry!

1241
01:18:00,347 --> 01:18:02,641
She'll be back in a minute.
Please, Chad!

1242
01:18:18,073 --> 01:18:19,283
I loved you.

1243
01:18:19,366 --> 01:18:20,742
That wasn't good enough!

1244
01:18:21,785 --> 01:18:22,911
[Julie] Please!

1245
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:24,496
Shut up.

1246
01:18:29,084 --> 01:18:30,961
Do you think you
and that bartender

1247
01:18:31,044 --> 01:18:33,297
are going to make a fool
of George Winfield?

1248
01:18:34,798 --> 01:18:36,758
I own this hotel!

1249
01:18:37,634 --> 01:18:39,469
That bastard worked for me!

1250
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:42,723
You betrayed me Elizabeth.

1251
01:18:44,057 --> 01:18:48,395
[Julie gagged and screaming]

1252
01:18:52,774 --> 01:18:55,277
I'm going to make sure
you never see him again.

1253
01:18:55,527 --> 01:18:57,654
[Elizabeth screaming]

1254
01:18:58,447 --> 01:19:00,490
[gagged screaming]

1255
01:20:03,470 --> 01:20:09,476
[Julie laughing hysterical]

1256
01:20:27,911 --> 01:20:29,329
[Narrator] By the 1908

1257
01:20:29,746 --> 01:20:31,707
mining companies were
making billions

1258
01:20:31,790 --> 01:20:33,750
and the city flourished.

1259
01:20:44,261 --> 01:20:48,098
George Winfield, the largest of
the mining owners.

1260
01:20:48,182 --> 01:20:51,894
One of the most politically
influential men of his day

1261
01:20:52,686 --> 01:20:56,398
decided to build
the Goldfield Hotel.

1262
01:21:05,532 --> 01:21:09,161
Considered the most spectacular
of its kind in Nevada,

1263
01:21:09,703 --> 01:21:14,583
it boasted an elevator and
running hot water in every room.

1264
01:21:23,842 --> 01:21:25,427
Over time,

1265
01:21:25,511 --> 01:21:30,265
gold declined and people began
to leave Goldfield.

1266
01:21:39,858 --> 01:21:41,902
By the time the depression hit

1267
01:21:41,985 --> 01:21:44,821
the hotel had fallen
on hard times

1268
01:21:44,905 --> 01:21:47,366
and was little more
than a flop house

1269
01:21:47,449 --> 01:21:51,787
for cowboys and
the indiscriminate traveller.

1270
01:22:04,633 --> 01:22:08,720
It was one stormy night in 1935

1271
01:22:09,179 --> 01:22:12,599
that truly changed
its history forever.

1272
01:22:20,732 --> 01:22:22,276
Legend has it

1273
01:22:22,359 --> 01:22:26,572
that night put a curse
on the hotel.

1274
01:22:41,712 --> 01:22:44,006
One thing is known for sure.

1275
01:22:44,798 --> 01:22:47,092
The Goldfield Hotel

1276
01:22:47,342 --> 01:22:51,180
has been closed ever since.

1277
01:27:14,401 --> 01:27:15,569
[grunts]
