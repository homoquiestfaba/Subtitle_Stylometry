1
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:26,333
<i>* I can see wrong and right
But I never choose a side *</i>

2
00:00:27,042 --> 00:00:29,375
<i>* Runnin' on red, not black or white *</i>

3
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:30,833
<i>* Grey is where I hide *</i>

4
00:00:30,917 --> 00:00:32,417
<i>* I'm always busy *</i>

5
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:34,917
<i>* When they all need me *</i>

6
00:00:36,167 --> 00:00:37,208
<i>* I wanna do it *</i>

7
00:00:38,292 --> 00:00:39,833
<i>* But I'm always gone *</i>

8
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:42,375
<i>* I wanna fight it *</i>

9
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:44,792
<i>* Instead, I listen *</i>

10
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:46,875
<i>* But now I'm different *</i>

11
00:00:47,792 --> 00:00:49,125
<i>* Found room to grow *</i>

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,292
<i>* Gonna kick the pieces of my shell now *</i>

13
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:55,583
<i>* Start a brand new journey *</i>

14
00:00:55,667 --> 00:00:58,458
<i>* Open up my heart again *</i>

15
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:02,625
<i>* Gonna let that little bird out *</i>

16
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:04,833
<i>* See the song unfolding *</i>

17
00:01:04,917 --> 00:01:07,708
<i>* Listen, everybody *</i>

18
00:01:07,792 --> 00:01:09,875
<i>* This is what I'm all about *</i>

19
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:11,958
<i>* I don't know where we're goin'd</i>

20
00:01:12,042 --> 00:01:14,625
<i>* But I know what's drivin' me *</i>

21
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:17,292
<i>* I know there's something in my mind *</i>

22
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:19,375
<i>* The better part of me *</i>

23
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:24,083
<i>* I know that someone else
Will see the funny side of me *</i>

24
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:27,042
<i>* I know that
Once you've learned to care *</i>

25
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:28,958
<i>* You'll see the little things *</i>

26
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:34,250
<i>* You'll see the little things *</i>

27
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:38,500
<i>* You'll see the little things *</i>

28
00:01:40,042 --> 00:01:41,042
Aaron.

29
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:43,417
Aaron!

30
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:45,875
Where have you been, man?

31
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:55,542
Can you stay by yourself for a moment?

32
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:57,125
- Be right back.
- Yeah.

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,417
Aaron! Aaron!

34
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,792
Not again, man.
Look what you did to the wall.

35
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,292
I did all that?

36
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,083
Look at your hands.

37
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,667
Forget about it. Time to go now.

38
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,167
What about my gloves?

39
00:03:32,292 --> 00:03:33,417
What was that?

40
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,500
What am I gonna fight with?

41
00:03:36,542 --> 00:03:37,542
Aaron.

42
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,625
Just take your guitar and follow me, okay?

43
00:03:42,792 --> 00:03:43,792
My guitar.

44
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,500
- Okay.
- Let's go.

45
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:56,375
The good thing about being crazy
is the fact that you don't realise it.

46
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,792
Well, that's not my case.

47
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,917
It all started when I first became champ.

48
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:08,458
I'd prepared for this
ever since I was a little kid.

49
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,625
The thing was,
that I was getting into the ring

50
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:14,792
thinking that the guy in front of me
stood between me and my dream.

51
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:33,292
<i>After each fight,</i>

52
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,167
<i>I felt sorry for what I had done...</i>

53
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,625
<i>but only for a while.</i>

54
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,333
<i>I became
the middleweight champion...</i>

55
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,375
<i>and it all changed.</i>

56
00:05:25,417 --> 00:05:28,250
<i>And, of course, there was Evelyn.</i>

57
00:05:36,292 --> 00:05:39,167
<i>My brain was definitely starting
to be affected because...</i>

58
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,208
Whoo!

59
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,333
The carpet there, please.

60
00:05:53,292 --> 00:05:54,292
Yes, there.

61
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,750
Uh, take the <i>Scarface</i> off.

62
00:05:58,458 --> 00:05:59,542
And the belt.

63
00:06:00,292 --> 00:06:02,625
We gotta change everything!

64
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:10,500
<i>To be honest, I wasn't preparing
for the fights like I used to.</i>

65
00:06:26,792 --> 00:06:27,833
Come on, Aaron.

66
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,458
<i>If we accept that
my marriage was the first sign</i>

67
00:06:53,542 --> 00:06:57,000
<i>that there was something wrong with me,
this was the second.</i>

68
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,042
<i>Very concerned for my health,</i>

69
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:09,083
<i>Michael and Evelyn wanted me to do just
one more fight before I took a break.</i>

70
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,792
<i>I hope you've caught
the irony in my words.</i>

71
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:47,250
- What's that mean?
- You cannot fight anymore.

72
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,277
- What?
- What?

73
00:07:48,292 --> 00:07:49,708
You should start treatment.

74
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:51,833
- How much is that gonna cost?
- Shut up, Evelyn.

75
00:07:51,917 --> 00:07:54,042
- I cannot talk about that?
- Shut your mouth, Evelyn.

76
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,667
He cannot fight anymore and
the lawsuits are coming, do you get it?

77
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,042
- I get it. I got it!
- Do you get it?

78
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,417
You're not!

79
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,125
I can't fight anymore?

80
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,500
<i>Yeah. The lawsuits came.</i>

81
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:05,708
<i>I lost.</i>

82
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:09,542
<i>I started getting lost almost every day.</i>

83
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:12,000
<i>Missing for hours.</i>

84
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:13,917
<i>Maybe days.</i>

85
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:18,250
Look at me, Aaron.

86
00:08:18,792 --> 00:08:20,667
Aaron, look at me!

87
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,208
Look at me!

88
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:26,625
I'm doing everything I can for you,
God is my witness.

89
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:30,708
I gave you all my support,
but you have to give something back!

90
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:32,542
Are you listening to me?

91
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,250
You don't care!

92
00:08:36,792 --> 00:08:38,417
You don't care about anything!

93
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,985
About nothing...

94
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,458
<i>Of course, Evelyn's reaction
was not surprising.</i>

95
00:08:50,917 --> 00:08:52,708
Aren't you gonna even try to stop me?

96
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,042
<i>My mind was blocked.</i>

97
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,542
<i>And that's how I ended up here.</i>

98
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:13,667
<i>Trying to make a living
through one of my old hobbies.</i>

99
00:09:54,917 --> 00:09:55,958
Bo... Bobby?

100
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,167
You're late for work.

101
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Shit.

102
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,667
You said you were gonna submit him
in the first round.

103
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,693
I tried.

104
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,458
You don't shut up,
he'll be disqualified.

105
00:10:12,542 --> 00:10:14,500
Hey, don't look at her in the eyes,
alright?

106
00:10:22,417 --> 00:10:23,708
Hurry up.

107
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,083
I'll be right there.

108
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:02,333
- I can't.
- You said you'd try.

109
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,958
I changed my mind.

110
00:11:05,042 --> 00:11:06,750
The doctor recommended this, remember?

111
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,375
Sorry, guys. Sorry.

112
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,083
He didn't recommend this place.

113
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,667
Shit. They've started without me.

114
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,667
Whoo!

115
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,542
Uh, maybe some
of you know this song.

116
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,708
<i>* Don't leave me this way *</i>

117
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,292
<i>* I can't survive *</i>

118
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,500
<i>* Can't stay alive *</i>

119
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:04,125
<i>* Don't leave me this way *</i>

120
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:08,875
<i>* I can't exist without your tender kiss *</i>

121
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:12,250
<i>* Don't leave me this way *</i>

122
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,583
<i>* Baby *</i>

123
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:19,000
<i>* My heart is full of love
And it's all for you *</i>

124
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:22,167
<i>* So come on down
And do what you gotta do *</i>

125
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,667
<i>* You started this fire down in my soul *</i>

126
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,458
<i>* Now, can't you see?
It's burning out of control *</i>

127
00:12:29,542 --> 00:12:32,208
<i>* Come on down
And satisfy the need in me *</i>

128
00:12:32,292 --> 00:12:35,417
<i>* 'Cause only your good loving
Can set me free *</i>

129
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,000
<i>* 'Cause only your good loving
Can set me free *</i>

130
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:48,083
<i>* Don't leave me this way *</i>

131
00:12:49,792 --> 00:12:51,792
<i>* I can't survive *</i>

132
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,708
<i>* I can't stay alive *</i>

133
00:12:57,417 --> 00:13:01,833
<i>* Don't leave me this way *</i>

134
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:09,083
<i>* I can't exist without your tender kiss *</i>

135
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:12,375
<i>* Don't leave me this way *</i>

136
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,583
<i>* Baby *</i>

137
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:17,750
<i>* My heart is full of love
And it's all for you *</i>

138
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:20,833
<i>* So come on down
And do what you gotta do *</i>

139
00:13:20,917 --> 00:13:24,167
<i>* You started this fire down in my soul *</i>

140
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,917
<i>* Only you can love me *</i>

141
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,708
<i>* And be out of control *</i>

142
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:30,208
<i>* Satisfy the need in me *</i>

143
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:33,458
<i>* Only your good loving can set me free *</i>

144
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:36,250
<i>* Only your good loving can set me free *</i>

145
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,625
<i>* Only your good loving *</i>

146
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:42,375
<i>* Can set me free *</i>

147
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:04,833
Where are you going?

148
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,000
One song? You can't do this again.

149
00:14:08,792 --> 00:14:10,542
I gave it all I got.

150
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,167
If I go on, then it won't be real.

151
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,417
Who gives a shit?
People are here to see you.

152
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:17,875
- Michael, please.
- Aaron.

153
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,083
We can't afford it, okay?

154
00:14:22,792 --> 00:14:25,208
It's clear for everyone now
that Aaron is kind of crazy.

155
00:14:25,292 --> 00:14:28,000
So, I'm taking over the story from now on.

156
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:31,708
Don't worry, you're in better hands.
And here comes the question.

157
00:14:31,792 --> 00:14:34,042
Who am I and what am I doing here? Right?

158
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:38,583
Well, it all started with her.

159
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,958
<i>We were born
and raised in Bulgaria.</i>

160
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:46,625
<i>Ever since I was little,
people were finding me too weird.</i>

161
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:49,917
<i>The thing was that,
up until my eighth year,</i>

162
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,875
<i>I simply refused
to communicate with anybody.</i>

163
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,125
<i>So, what?</i>

164
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,792
<i>So, what?</i>

165
00:14:56,875 --> 00:15:00,125
<i>Because of her,
my parents made me learn sign language.</i>

166
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,208
<i>Come on. It's not that easy.</i>

167
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,083
<i>I spent almost a year studying.</i>

168
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:15,833
<i>I could at least have had
a few deaf friends.</i>

169
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,750
<i>My parents decided I was retarded.</i>

170
00:15:20,792 --> 00:15:24,292
<i>They sent me to a school
for mentally challenged children.</i>

171
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:28,917
<i>There were only gypsies there,
who weren't retarded.</i>

172
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,458
<i>They were there
because of the free textbooks and food.</i>

173
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,917
<i>I don't know what made me leave
my usual apathetic state.</i>

174
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:43,083
<i>Spitting competition?</i>

175
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:47,375
<i>I don't know, but that was the start
of a very unusual friendship.</i>

176
00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:53,375
<i>Actually,
it was the start of a new family.</i>

177
00:15:57,917 --> 00:16:01,875
<i>They taught me everything they knew,
and I quickly became one of the them.</i>

178
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:08,417
<i>You know that sexual maturation
usually does not come with a mental one.</i>

179
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,000
<i>With Jana, it was even more...</i>

180
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:14,167
<i>Actually, you better see it for yourself.</i>

181
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,458
Here comes the crazy Jana.

182
00:16:26,042 --> 00:16:27,417
Beware not to let her catch you.

183
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,458
Bobby?

184
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,458
Shut up, you morons.

185
00:16:38,542 --> 00:16:39,750
<i>That was it.</i>

186
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:43,667
<i>The only people Jana wanted to have
something to do with were the gypsies...</i>

187
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:46,625
<i>and me.</i>

188
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:04,917
What's up, babe?

189
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,125
Hey, Mr. Hunter.

190
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,083
- Hi.
- Did you see that girl who...

191
00:17:28,167 --> 00:17:30,542
- who was walking around all the people?
- I didn't see her.

192
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:33,708
Uh, well... well, that's my sister. Yeah.

193
00:17:33,792 --> 00:17:36,333
- It's your sister?
- Yeah, and her name is, uh, Jana.

194
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:39,500
- Jana, come back!
- I won't do it.

195
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,375
We need the money.

196
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,042
- And you have to talk to other people.
- Don't make me, Bobby!

197
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:49,292
- There is a guy who...
- Please, don't make me go back.

198
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,542
His bed is
right next to the door.

199
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:10,750
Okay.

200
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:16,083
Jana, don't you think it's time
you found someone?

201
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:19,167
I don't know.

202
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,000
I have you, don't I?

203
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,000
You know what I mean.

204
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,542
You want to get rid of me!

205
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:29,667
No, I don't.
It's a normal thing for every woman.

206
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,250
Now you think I'm normal.

207
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:37,458
What about Aaron? The singer.

208
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:41,125
But... he's crazy.

209
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,125
At least he likes you.

210
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,792
You don't know.

211
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,542
I'm not making this up.
I spoke to him.

212
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:56,208
You can go on a date, hang out.
We'll see how it turns out.

213
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,250
Look, this might be good for both of us.

214
00:19:00,292 --> 00:19:03,167
He used to be a fighter.

215
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,208
Jana?

216
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,125
Hey, Bobby.

217
00:19:23,417 --> 00:19:25,292
Bobby, I know you're in there.

218
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:28,500
I saw you come back
with that crazy wacko sister of yours.

219
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,750
Hey, calm down, John.
I'll give you the money, okay?

220
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,750
- When?
- Soon, man. Soon.

221
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:35,208
It's just, my sister's medication
is very expensive, okay?

222
00:19:35,292 --> 00:19:38,083
I understand, Bobby.
But don't bullshit me.

223
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:41,125
'Cause I'll send you back to Bolivia
or wherever the hell you came from!

224
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,333
- It's not Bolivia. It's Bulgaria.
- Whatever!

225
00:19:43,417 --> 00:19:45,583
Freaking Bulgaria, Bolivia. Who cares?

226
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,167
Ain't gonna give his money back.
Of course not.

227
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:53,500
But in order to fully understand
what I'm about to do now,

228
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,708
I should tell you more about me.

229
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:01,000
Now is the time for the camera
to zoom towards my face.

230
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:04,875
Yeah, that's better.

231
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:13,292
When I was 20,
I became a national kickboxing champion.

232
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,375
Yeah.

233
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,667
And also won a few MMA tournaments.

234
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,500
Whoo!

235
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:43,583
Since I was a child,
I was hooked on American movies,

236
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,833
but I wasn't prepared
for the Bulgarian reality yet.

237
00:20:46,917 --> 00:20:48,958
Mmm.

238
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:52,292
Come on.

239
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:57,167
<i>I always dreamed of living in Manhattan.</i>

240
00:21:04,417 --> 00:21:06,375
<i>I was surprised how cheap the rent was.</i>

241
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,125
<i>The path to my dream
was going to be a long one.</i>

242
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,917
<i>So, I had to find a job.</i>

243
00:21:16,167 --> 00:21:19,208
<i>I decided to ask
for help from my coach, Teddy.</i>

244
00:21:19,292 --> 00:21:22,125
<i>And he asked me,
"What could you do except fighting?"</i>

245
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,000
<i>Finally, my sister was useful.</i>

246
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:29,917
<i>I came up with the brilliant idea
of starting a company called.</i>

247
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,417
<i>Music for the Deaf.</i>

248
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,958
Freaking Bulgaria, Bolivia. Who cares?

249
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:38,167
Well, that's not alright.

250
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:40,333
We should rewind a bit.

251
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,958
It's just my sister's medication
is very expensive.

252
00:21:46,042 --> 00:21:48,333
I understand, Bobby.
But don't bullshit me.

253
00:21:48,417 --> 00:21:51,500
'Cause I'll send you back to Bolivia,
or wherever the hell you came from!

254
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:53,292
- It's Bulgaria. Not Bolivia.
- Whatever!

255
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,542
Freaking Bulgaria, Bolivia. Who cares?

256
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:02,875
Bobby!

257
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:08,667
Bobby, it's been a few months
since I've seen money.

258
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,750
I swear I'll come back with immigration.

259
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:14,417
- What are you doing?
- I want you to listen.

260
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:18,167
You can go back
on your banana boat, back to Bolivia!

261
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:23,250
You and your sister can say goodbye
to your dreams of getting green cards.

262
00:22:25,042 --> 00:22:26,042
Bobby!

263
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,458
I'm coming back with immigration!
I swear to God!

264
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:52,792
You look really nice!

265
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:15,458
It's okay. Um...

266
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:17,875
We're safe now.

267
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:20,375
Calm down. Everything's fine.

268
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:22,125
I... I don't feel good.

269
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:28,125
I spent all day preparing,
and maybe I overdid it with...

270
00:23:28,917 --> 00:23:30,000
my make-up.

271
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:33,375
Yeah, it's too much, but you look fine.

272
00:23:34,417 --> 00:23:35,917
Look...

273
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:37,833
You have problems.

274
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:44,042
Everyone can see that,
but I can read your vibrations,

275
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:47,250
and they are telling me
you're not a bad person.

276
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,167
Don't you think we're like two parents

277
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,750
who have left their children
at preschool for the first time?

278
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,667
I can't believe you're using
your sister like that.

279
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,500
I'm sure you guys are making tons
of cash from his concerts.

280
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:09,750
Aaron can't make a comeback.
He's banned for life.

281
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:11,458
Not in Bulgaria.

282
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:13,667
He hasn't.

283
00:24:14,917 --> 00:24:18,167
But anyway,
I don't feel a connection between us.

284
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:22,000
So, let's not waste our time, please.

285
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:28,625
What?

286
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,708
I'm sorry, um...

287
00:24:31,792 --> 00:24:33,375
You know I have, uh...

288
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:34,833
Oh, don't take it personally.

289
00:24:34,917 --> 00:24:38,042
I just don't like people in general.

290
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:43,833
No, it's, it's hard for me to follow
when someone is talking for a long time.

291
00:24:44,542 --> 00:24:46,167
I got the first part.

292
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:51,625
But, judging from your expression,
the rest wasn't so positive.

293
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:56,375
Wow, it's not possible
to have a conversation with you.

294
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:57,458
I...

295
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,625
I better go now.

296
00:25:05,208 --> 00:25:06,417
<i>How'd the date go?</i>

297
00:25:09,667 --> 00:25:11,458
Aaron, I asked you a question.

298
00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:17,417
I have to remind you
that if you don't want to speak with me,

299
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:20,708
you will become
a permanent resident of my clinic,

300
00:25:21,542 --> 00:25:23,000
and you will be given sedatives

301
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:26,458
that will keep you very calm
and cooperative at all times.

302
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:33,542
She's just a lot crazier than me.
That's all.

303
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:42,375
You know that I get along
better with wackos, but this was too much.

304
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,292
Excuse me.
Are you talking to me?

305
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:47,042
No, I'm talking to my brother.

306
00:25:47,917 --> 00:25:49,208
Forty dollars, please.

307
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:53,000
Now, I'm talking to you.

308
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:54,583
<i>Crazier than you.</i>

309
00:25:55,667 --> 00:25:56,667
Could you explain?

310
00:25:58,083 --> 00:25:59,833
I took her to a nice place.

311
00:25:59,917 --> 00:26:02,500
He took me
to a crowded diner.

312
00:26:02,583 --> 00:26:04,917
It's the first place
that came into my mind.

313
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,875
I always choose the first because...

314
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,250
I'm afraid if...

315
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:12,875
if I choose the second,

316
00:26:12,958 --> 00:26:15,958
then I'll forget
what I'm thinking about in general.

317
00:26:16,042 --> 00:26:19,417
I decided to be
completely honest with him but he just...

318
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,292
This woman...

319
00:26:22,292 --> 00:26:24,083
talks so much.

320
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:27,625
And she expects me
to listen to everything she has to say.

321
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:30,000
What happened after the date?

322
00:26:37,792 --> 00:26:38,792
Hey!

323
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:43,125
Come back.

324
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:46,625
What are you doing in there?

325
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:50,375
So the guys from the restaurant
don't catch me.

326
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:56,375
Oh, I... I gave them some money.
I already paid for everything.

327
00:26:57,042 --> 00:26:59,250
I-I'm not gonna pay you back.

328
00:27:00,292 --> 00:27:01,667
Well, okay.

329
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:05,583
Bye.

330
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,125
Wait.

331
00:27:10,458 --> 00:27:13,875
After the date, she wanted me to,
um... walk her home

332
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,875
'cause she can't walk on the street
because of all the people.

333
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:21,625
Yeah, she sure chose
the right person to ask, right?

334
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:24,167
He didn't even want
to get a cab for me.

335
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:26,208
If you call it,
I'll pay for it.

336
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,458
Are you crazy?

337
00:27:28,542 --> 00:27:31,000
You probably want me
to talk to him as well.

338
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:33,500
No, no. I can talk to him.

339
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:36,583
I-I just can't... I just can't stop it.

340
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:43,083
I stopped it!
Can you imagine?

341
00:27:43,167 --> 00:27:44,833
No.

342
00:27:44,917 --> 00:27:47,417
- Hold up?
- Yeah.

343
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,208
Hey, were you waving at me?

344
00:27:51,792 --> 00:27:53,875
Yeah! Uh, could you take us to...

345
00:27:53,958 --> 00:27:55,667
Canal and West Broadway.

346
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,292
Canal and West Broadway?

347
00:27:58,458 --> 00:27:59,708
Are you guys insane?

348
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,792
We're perfectly normal.

349
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:06,250
The world is insane.

350
00:28:06,833 --> 00:28:10,875
He said he wasn't
completely alright in the head, but...

351
00:28:12,167 --> 00:28:16,042
I tell you,
after that date that I had with her,

352
00:28:18,458 --> 00:28:20,458
I haven't felt that sane in years.

353
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:24,375
This is where
the craziest part happened.

354
00:28:26,708 --> 00:28:28,458
And then
she keeps whining about...

355
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:30,583
...how dangerous it is.

356
00:28:32,708 --> 00:28:34,542
Do you come home like this every night?

357
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:38,167
Me and my brother owe the neighbour money.

358
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,750
<i>And you just left him there?</i>

359
00:28:56,625 --> 00:28:58,792
That's crazy... Uh, I'm sorry.

360
00:28:58,875 --> 00:29:01,458
No, I understand you entirely.

361
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:04,958
But I just realised something else.

362
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,000
This is the first time
you've managed to tell

363
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:10,708
the entire story in the right order.

364
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:12,792
I want you to think about that.

365
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:14,125
You know it won't last long.

366
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:15,583
Yes, I know.

367
00:29:16,292 --> 00:29:17,292
That is why...

368
00:29:17,833 --> 00:29:21,542
Please forget everything I said
at the start of the conversation.

369
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:24,125
With any luck, you probably already have.

370
00:29:26,708 --> 00:29:28,583
Take these twice a day. They'll help.

371
00:29:31,792 --> 00:29:32,833
Michael!

372
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:38,458
- I saw you, Michael.
- I told you already.

373
00:29:38,542 --> 00:29:39,625
You want too much.

374
00:29:39,708 --> 00:29:43,125
I want a normal alimony
without taking it to court.

375
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:45,167
The tour is off. He ran off stage again.

376
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,042
Why do you expect him to do normal things?

377
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:49,542
- You should know better.
- You'll just leave him on the street!

378
00:29:49,625 --> 00:29:51,542
- What does he need you for?
- Aaron is out of control.

379
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:53,667
- It's like dealing with a child.
- I'm a woman.

380
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,917
Do you expect me to feel sorry
about my ex...

381
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,583
Exactly, you are a woman.
You're supposed to be sorry for him.

382
00:29:58,667 --> 00:30:00,833
I want my alimony. Then I will be sorry.

383
00:30:00,917 --> 00:30:02,375
Well, that's not happening now!

384
00:30:02,458 --> 00:30:04,625
Well, you're not leaving me any choice.

385
00:30:04,708 --> 00:30:07,292
- Well, fuck you, Evelyn!
- Fuck you, Michael!

386
00:30:14,042 --> 00:30:16,875
Okay. Well, there is one weird option.

387
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:22,792
- No way! Never again!
- We both need it.

388
00:30:23,708 --> 00:30:25,958
- I don't feel it.
- I don't care.

389
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:30,750
Why are you still driving?
You don't have a license!

390
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:35,833
I might have to take you back to Bulgaria.

391
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:48,833
- And you'll stay here?
- But you like it there.

392
00:31:11,458 --> 00:31:13,000
And you won't say anything?

393
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:34,958
Come with me.

394
00:31:37,292 --> 00:31:38,292
What are you doing?

395
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,167
- I didn't pay for these, did I?
- No.

396
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:46,083
Oh, God.

397
00:31:46,917 --> 00:31:48,375
We gotta take these back.

398
00:31:48,917 --> 00:31:50,667
- Hey!
- It's too late. Come!

399
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:56,083
<i>* And by the time you feel this, baby
You'll be wet and more *</i>

400
00:31:56,167 --> 00:31:58,875
<i>* Shivering and shaking
Like some freaky baby *</i>

401
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,083
Hey, where's your car?

402
00:32:00,833 --> 00:32:02,000
Oh, cool.

403
00:32:03,292 --> 00:32:06,000
Hey, there. Unlock the door.

404
00:32:06,083 --> 00:32:07,708
Unlock...

405
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:19,458
And?

406
00:32:23,625 --> 00:32:25,500
I have to borrow your bike.

407
00:32:25,583 --> 00:32:27,583
- What?
- I'll... I'll bring it right back.

408
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:34,042
Uh, dude?

409
00:32:35,208 --> 00:32:36,958
I think Aaron Hunter just stole my bike.

410
00:32:42,583 --> 00:32:44,042
- You left me.
- I know.

411
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:46,125
Why?

412
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:48,458
Nobody else gets into the car,
only my brother.

413
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,958
Well, I had to steal a bike
because of you.

414
00:32:51,792 --> 00:32:53,083
It will help you get home.

415
00:33:06,667 --> 00:33:09,458
<i>* And by the time you feel this, baby
You'll be wet and more *</i>

416
00:33:09,542 --> 00:33:10,750
<i>* Shivering and shaking *</i>

417
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:13,458
<i>* Like some freaky baby girl
On the dance floor *</i>

418
00:33:13,542 --> 00:33:16,167
<i>* So drip it from your lips
I got your jazz all wet *</i>

419
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,583
<i>* Your keys are screamin' in high C *</i>

420
00:33:18,667 --> 00:33:20,458
<i>* Your chord, your dripping sweat *</i>

421
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:23,417
<i>* Now I'm turnin' my dolls up
To my frequency *</i>

422
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:27,458
<i>* Baby, the coalition of your atoms
Is freaking me *</i>

423
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,958
<i>* I see you spillin' whole notes
Out your mouth with no rest *</i>

424
00:33:34,167 --> 00:33:37,667
<i>* You spillin' majors and minors
And sharps and clefts *</i>

425
00:33:38,792 --> 00:33:39,875
<i>* And you rockin'd</i>

426
00:33:39,958 --> 00:33:41,708
<i>* And you rockin' and rollin'd</i>

427
00:33:41,792 --> 00:33:43,417
<i>* Soul drippin' off the ceiling *</i>

428
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,083
<i>* Give me love with feeling *</i>

429
00:33:45,167 --> 00:33:47,125
<i>* Give me love with feeling *</i>

430
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:48,208
Aaron.

431
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Aaron.

432
00:33:55,792 --> 00:33:57,292
I, um...

433
00:33:58,917 --> 00:34:01,208
I didn't remember...
I didn't know how I got here.

434
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:03,375
I, uh...

435
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,875
- It's all right.
- I think I remember now.

436
00:34:06,875 --> 00:34:07,958
I will take you back.

437
00:34:09,167 --> 00:34:11,500
Okay, okay.

438
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:13,458
- Okay?
- Okay.

439
00:34:22,958 --> 00:34:25,125
Hey, Doc.
Are you noticing what I think you should...

440
00:34:25,208 --> 00:34:26,667
<i>Aaron, I'm with a patient.</i>

441
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:29,917
She must be boring you to death
because you answered the phone.

442
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,917
<i>Let me guess.
You haven't been taking your meds.</i>

443
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,250
No, and I'm lookin' you
in your eyes, you see?

444
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:35,750
<i>Alcohol works as well.</i>

445
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:38,458
- Now, you know I don't drink.
<i>- It must be a woman, then.</i>

446
00:34:38,542 --> 00:34:41,792
<i>Knowing how antisocial you are,
it should be the one from the last time.</i>

447
00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:43,667
<i>So, she's not crazy anymore?</i>

448
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:46,542
No, she's still crazy. But in a good way.

449
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:47,625
<i>There's a good way?</i>

450
00:34:48,208 --> 00:34:50,875
Listen, I don't know if it's
because of her. I just wanted you to see...

451
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:53,083
...I'm doing well, lookin' you in the eyes.

452
00:34:53,167 --> 00:34:54,792
- Aaron!
- And my memory's stable.

453
00:34:57,042 --> 00:34:58,417
- Aaron Hunter?
- Yeah.

454
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,667
You are under arrest...

455
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,167
- Let go of me. I haven't done anything.
- Sir, let him go.

456
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:05,333
- I was just walking down the street.
- Let him go right now.

457
00:35:05,417 --> 00:35:08,167
- Look, you're makin' a mistake.
- Let go of him right now.

458
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,417
But I haven't done anything!

459
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,833
You have stolen a bike!

460
00:35:10,917 --> 00:35:12,792
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did!

461
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:16,167
Oh, yes. I did. Alright. Yeah.

462
00:35:20,667 --> 00:35:22,000
I'll start taking my pills.

463
00:35:43,792 --> 00:35:48,625
<i>* I can see wrong and right
But I never choose a side *</i>

464
00:35:49,292 --> 00:35:51,500
<i>* Runnin' on red, not black or white *</i>

465
00:35:52,208 --> 00:35:54,958
<i>* Open up my heart again *</i>

466
00:35:56,583 --> 00:35:59,000
<i>* Gonna let that little bird out *</i>

467
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:01,333
<i>* See the song unfolding *</i>

468
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,292
<i>* Listen, everybody *</i>

469
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,917
- Nice day.
- Yeah, hot.

470
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:16,250
Thanks.

471
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,250
I've parked further down.

472
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:20,833
It's 25 bucks per hour.

473
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:27,083
- Yo, Bobby!
- Hi, Tony. I'm in a hurry, man.

474
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:29,708
I got that job you asked for.

475
00:36:31,792 --> 00:36:32,792
You can serve here.

476
00:36:35,708 --> 00:36:38,333
- So, do I look like a waiter?
- No, but the other day, you...

477
00:36:38,417 --> 00:36:39,667
Do I look like a waiter to you?

478
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:41,833
Hold on, Bobby.
You're the one who was asking for a job.

479
00:36:41,917 --> 00:36:44,208
- I'm offering you a job.
- Go inside or I'll kick your ass.

480
00:36:44,292 --> 00:36:46,833
- What the hell's wrong with you?
- You want me to serve tables?

481
00:36:47,458 --> 00:36:48,958
I was a champion, alright? Fuck off!

482
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:50,042
- No, fuck you.
- Fuck off!

483
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:52,583
- Fuck you, Bobby.
- I'm sorry, man.

484
00:36:53,667 --> 00:36:56,167
- You guys are lovers or something?
- No.

485
00:36:56,833 --> 00:36:59,500
- You a champion of what?
- Yeah, I was a champion like you.

486
00:37:00,167 --> 00:37:01,542
Oh, yeah. Michael said that.

487
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:03,083
Yeah, I was a state champion.

488
00:37:04,042 --> 00:37:05,917
I shook the hand of the prime minister.

489
00:37:07,333 --> 00:37:09,250
You know what they call that in Bulgaria?

490
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:11,500
- What?
- They call it success.

491
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,625
Big success.

492
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:17,708
How did you get me out?

493
00:37:17,792 --> 00:37:19,167
I bailed you out.

494
00:37:20,625 --> 00:37:22,208
Where did you get all that money?

495
00:37:22,292 --> 00:37:23,375
I got money.

496
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:25,917
Is this is your car?

497
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:28,083
Uh, no.

498
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:30,583
But you got money?

499
00:37:30,667 --> 00:37:31,708
Yeah, I got money.

500
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:33,625
Okay.

501
00:37:34,167 --> 00:37:35,500
So, whose car is this?

502
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,917
Alright, Jana sold the car.
Are you happy now?

503
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,708
- Sold your car?
- Yeah.

504
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:42,208
No, I'm not happy.

505
00:37:42,292 --> 00:37:44,125
You could've asked Michael for the money.

506
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:45,833
You got in jail
'cause of me and my sister.

507
00:37:45,917 --> 00:37:47,917
Michael has nothing to do with it, okay?

508
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,375
What? Now, how does Jana get around, then?

509
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:54,125
She walks, she uses the subway,
she meets people, that's good for her.

510
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:55,500
- Oh, man.
- Let's go.

511
00:37:56,042 --> 00:37:57,833
- Come on.
- That's so not cool.

512
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,417
So not cool.

513
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:03,833
- Come on.
- I'm sorry, man.

514
00:38:03,917 --> 00:38:05,708
I didn't mean to cause all this trouble.

515
00:38:08,792 --> 00:38:10,042
Do you remember this song?

516
00:38:10,958 --> 00:38:13,583
Uh, yeah, you sang it in the club.

517
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:15,542
- Yeah, I sang it in the club.
- Okay.

518
00:38:15,625 --> 00:38:18,542
"Don't Leave Me This Way",
Harold Melvin and The Blue Notes.

519
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:20,458
- So?
- That's a sign.

520
00:38:20,542 --> 00:38:21,583
Sign for what?

521
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
<i>* Don't leave me this way *</i>

522
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:34,375
- Sing this song with me, man.
- You're busted completely.

523
00:38:34,458 --> 00:38:36,083
Come on.

524
00:38:36,167 --> 00:38:40,500
You sing this song with me,
and I will do this fight against you.

525
00:38:40,583 --> 00:38:42,542
- You don't joke about it.
- I'm not joking.

526
00:38:42,625 --> 00:38:46,750
If you sing this song with me,
then I will make my comeback against you.

527
00:38:46,833 --> 00:38:49,042
- Can I make you do that?
- Yes, you can make me do this.

528
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:52,250
Listen, you just lost your job
as a waiter,

529
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:55,792
and it's because of me
that you sold your sister's car.

530
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:58,500
So, it's the least I can do for you guys.
Sing this song for me.

531
00:39:00,458 --> 00:39:02,333
<i>* Aah *</i>

532
00:39:02,417 --> 00:39:03,958
<i>* Baby *</i>

533
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:07,000
<i>* My heart is full of love
And it's all for you *</i>

534
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,583
<i>* Now come on down, now *</i>

535
00:39:09,667 --> 00:39:11,958
<i>- d What you gotta do? d</i>
- Yeah.

536
00:39:12,042 --> 00:39:14,958
<i>* You started this fire down in my soul *</i>

537
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:19,875
<i>* Can't you see it's burning
Out of control</i> *

538
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:23,583
<i>* So come down
And satisfy the need in me *</i>

539
00:39:23,667 --> 00:39:27,250
<i>* 'Cause only your good loving
Can set me free *</i>

540
00:39:28,542 --> 00:39:30,083
<i>* Free, free *</i>

541
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:34,750
<i>* Don't leave me this way *</i>

542
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:36,833
<i>* 'Cause it would be wrong *</i>

543
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:40,250
We're thrilled to inform you that
the event is gonna take place

544
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:42,292
here on the 27th,

545
00:39:42,375 --> 00:39:46,375
which will be Aaron "Lionheart" Hunter's
official return on the ring

546
00:39:46,458 --> 00:39:49,750
against the young fighter Boris Goo...

547
00:39:49,833 --> 00:39:53,458
- Borislav.
- Borislav "Good Night" Tyumbev.

548
00:39:53,542 --> 00:39:55,000
- Tumbev.
- Whatever, man.

549
00:39:55,083 --> 00:39:56,333
Yes?

550
00:39:56,417 --> 00:40:00,292
Mr. Tumbev, or should I say Mr. Good Night,

551
00:40:00,375 --> 00:40:03,625
please accept my apologies,
but you're not a well-known name

552
00:40:03,708 --> 00:40:04,917
in the MMA world.

553
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,583
How did you get to such a big fight
against Aaron Hunter?

554
00:40:08,833 --> 00:40:10,458
You may joke around with my nickname,

555
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:13,708
but when the fight is done,
you'll lose the irony, so...

556
00:40:13,792 --> 00:40:16,083
Mr. Tumbev,
you're not very humble, are you?

557
00:40:16,167 --> 00:40:18,167
It's hard to be humble
when you are the best!

558
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:20,125
Mr. Hunter?

559
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:23,292
Because of your mental condition,
you've been banned from fighting.

560
00:40:23,375 --> 00:40:25,792
- Only in the States.
- And even so.

561
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:29,542
Mr. Hunter, do you think it's a good idea
to return to the ring for this fight?

562
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:33,458
- Mr. Hunter?
- Mr. Hunter?

563
00:40:35,792 --> 00:40:37,167
Sorry. Which fight?

564
00:40:40,667 --> 00:40:41,792
Come on, come on.

565
00:40:50,875 --> 00:40:52,333
We arrived in Bulgaria thinking...

566
00:40:55,583 --> 00:40:58,542
...or at least I thought,
we were gonna receive a warmer welcome.

567
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:02,667
Famous sponsors were not crazy
about us, either.

568
00:41:03,625 --> 00:41:06,167
So that made us cut the budget
for lodging, training,

569
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:08,875
and go to the only place
I didn't want to return to.

570
00:41:08,958 --> 00:41:11,583
Or at least not in this way.

571
00:41:36,167 --> 00:41:38,042
Hi, Mum.

572
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,750
- Oh, Bobby.
- Hi, Mum.

573
00:41:44,167 --> 00:41:45,917
Jana?

574
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:50,875
- Where's dad?
- Jana...

575
00:41:54,875 --> 00:41:56,750
Leave your brother alone!

576
00:41:56,833 --> 00:41:59,333
That's your brother, Bobby. Remember?
You should not hit him.

577
00:42:04,292 --> 00:42:07,458
- Hey! Hey, hey!
- Daddy!

578
00:42:11,417 --> 00:42:14,167
Well, this is my father.
Uh, this is Michael.

579
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:16,333
- Hey, I'm Michael.
- Hi.

580
00:42:16,417 --> 00:42:18,375
- Pleasure meeting you.
- This is Aaron.

581
00:42:18,458 --> 00:42:20,667
- Ah, you're American?
- Aaron?

582
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:22,167
- Hey.
- Nice to meet you.

583
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:23,458
And this is Teddy.

584
00:42:26,125 --> 00:42:27,125
Uh...

585
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:38,542
Bobby, could you tell your father
he's really bad at raising children?

586
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:39,875
Dad, Mum said that...

587
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:42,292
Tell your mother that
since I've had the first pair of twins,

588
00:42:42,375 --> 00:42:43,792
I can handle the second one, too.

589
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:47,792
Tell him he had very little to do with the
handling of the first ones, you know that.

590
00:42:47,875 --> 00:42:48,958
Mum said...

591
00:42:49,042 --> 00:42:51,583
Tell your mother this isn't
the way to greet guests.

592
00:42:51,667 --> 00:42:55,833
- Okay, that's enough. Come on in!
- Welcome, guys.

593
00:42:55,917 --> 00:42:59,625
Uh, Bobby,
do you remember Silvia?

594
00:42:59,708 --> 00:43:00,750
Of course.

595
00:43:00,833 --> 00:43:03,167
We sat next to each other at school.

596
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:09,458
Your laundry is above my roses, again!

597
00:43:09,542 --> 00:43:11,583
I'm just watering them.
What are you complaining about?

598
00:43:11,667 --> 00:43:16,500
You'll see when I cut it off!

599
00:43:16,583 --> 00:43:18,167
- Please, come inside.
- Let's go, guys.

600
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,417
Are you sure
we can practice here?

601
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,125
This is where I started my career.

602
00:43:53,167 --> 00:43:54,167
What career?

603
00:43:57,083 --> 00:44:00,167
What is that?

604
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,417
Alright, guys. I spoke to the guard.

605
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,458
It's okay.
It's just a traditional dance class.

606
00:44:16,542 --> 00:44:18,667
So, we can use the other side of the gym.

607
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:20,917
It's okay? What about all this noise?

608
00:45:20,208 --> 00:45:21,417
Whoo!

609
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:24,167
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye!

610
00:45:27,083 --> 00:45:29,042
You just scared me.

611
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:34,083
At first I thought...
You might think I was crazy...

612
00:45:34,917 --> 00:45:35,958
but then I remembered.

613
00:45:38,625 --> 00:45:41,500
This is beautiful, here.

614
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:52,958
Whoo!

615
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,917
<i>* Put a little bit of soul into everyday *</i>

616
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,833
<i>* Add a little bit of joy
It will never fade *</i>

617
00:46:11,917 --> 00:46:13,500
<i>* Let's have a good time *</i>

618
00:46:15,042 --> 00:46:17,500
<i>* A good, good time *</i>

619
00:46:18,042 --> 00:46:21,000
<i>* Put a little bit of soul into everyday *</i>

620
00:46:21,083 --> 00:46:23,833
<i>* Add a little bit of joy
It will never fade *</i>

621
00:46:23,917 --> 00:46:25,708
<i>* Let's have a good time *</i>

622
00:46:26,958 --> 00:46:29,542
<i>* We're making good, good times *</i>

623
00:46:30,167 --> 00:46:31,500
<i>* Oh, yeah *</i>

624
00:46:36,833 --> 00:46:39,000
<i>* Oh, yeah, yeah *</i>

625
00:46:42,917 --> 00:46:45,750
Thank you all so very much!

626
00:46:45,833 --> 00:46:46,958
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

627
00:46:47,042 --> 00:46:49,417
I see we have
a special guest here tonight,

628
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,208
someone we all admire,

629
00:46:51,292 --> 00:46:53,875
and we'd love it if he would come up
on stage and sing us a song!

630
00:46:53,958 --> 00:46:56,958
Please give him a big hand of applause,
Mr. Aaron Hunter!

631
00:46:58,458 --> 00:47:00,333
They want you to play something. Come on.

632
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:01,458
Now?

633
00:47:01,542 --> 00:47:03,708
You don't have to do it
if you don't want to.

634
00:47:03,792 --> 00:47:05,292
It's a good opportunity.

635
00:47:31,875 --> 00:47:34,708
I was just writing this song
when I was chasing you

636
00:47:34,792 --> 00:47:36,333
with the bike that I stole.

637
00:47:36,417 --> 00:47:37,958
You're on a mic, Aaron.

638
00:47:40,333 --> 00:47:41,708
Uh...

639
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:43,542
Hi, I'm Aaron.

640
00:47:44,333 --> 00:47:48,750
And, um,
I recently just started doing music,

641
00:47:48,833 --> 00:47:51,750
so I apologise
for what I'm about to do to you.

642
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,542
Oh, yeah, and I make my comeback
in the ring on the 27th

643
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:03,250
with your fellow countryman, Bobby Tumbev.

644
00:48:03,333 --> 00:48:04,583
Yeah, Tumbev.

645
00:48:04,667 --> 00:48:06,042
Tumbev. Tumbev.

646
00:48:07,792 --> 00:48:11,250
Um, I know I should've told you at the end
of the song for a better effect,

647
00:48:11,333 --> 00:48:13,875
but I doubt I would have remembered
because you know I had this...

648
00:48:16,625 --> 00:48:19,583
Um, but at least I took my meds today,

649
00:48:19,667 --> 00:48:22,417
so I may manage to get through
the whole song.

650
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,583
Okay, I'm ready.

651
00:48:46,917 --> 00:48:51,667
<i>* I can see wrong and right
But I never choose a side *</i>

652
00:48:52,333 --> 00:48:54,708
<i>* Runnin' on red, not black or white *</i>

653
00:48:54,792 --> 00:48:56,167
<i>* Grey is where I hide *</i>

654
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:57,917
<i>* I'm always busy *</i>

655
00:48:58,875 --> 00:49:00,458
<i>* When they all need me *</i>

656
00:49:01,042 --> 00:49:03,500
<i>* I want to do it *</i>

657
00:49:03,583 --> 00:49:05,167
<i>* But I'm always gone *</i>

658
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:07,375
<i>* I wanna fight it *</i>

659
00:49:08,083 --> 00:49:09,833
<i>* Instead, I listen *</i>

660
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,292
<i>* But now I'm different *</i>

661
00:49:12,958 --> 00:49:14,292
<i>* Got room to grow *</i>

662
00:49:15,375 --> 00:49:18,500
<i>* Gonna kick the pieces of my shell now *</i>

663
00:49:18,583 --> 00:49:21,042
<i>* Start a brand new story *</i>

664
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:23,792
<i>* Open up my heart again *</i>

665
00:49:25,583 --> 00:49:27,958
<i>* Gonna let that little bird out *</i>

666
00:49:28,042 --> 00:49:30,667
<i>* See the song unfolding *</i>

667
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:33,167
<i>* Listen, everybody *</i>

668
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:35,792
<i>* This is what I'm all about *</i>

669
00:49:35,875 --> 00:49:37,917
<i>* I don't know where we're goin'd</i>

670
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,708
<i>* But I know what's drivin' me *</i>

671
00:49:40,792 --> 00:49:43,333
<i>* I know there's something in my mind *</i>

672
00:49:43,417 --> 00:49:45,583
<i>* The better part of me *</i>

673
00:49:45,667 --> 00:49:50,417
<i>* I know that someone else
Will see the funny side of me *</i>

674
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:53,375
<i>* I know that
Once you've learned to care *</i>

675
00:49:53,458 --> 00:49:55,792
<i>* You'll see the simple things *</i>

676
00:49:58,292 --> 00:50:01,333
<i>* You'll see the simple things *</i>

677
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:06,708
<i>* See the simple things *</i>

678
00:50:08,167 --> 00:50:09,833
<i>* Oh, yeah, yeah *</i>

679
00:50:14,417 --> 00:50:17,083
<i>* By the time you feel this, baby
You'll be wanting more *</i>

680
00:50:19,333 --> 00:50:22,167
<i>* Shivering and shaking
Up on the dance floor *</i>

681
00:50:23,833 --> 00:50:27,125
<i>* So drip it from your lips
I got your jazz all wet *</i>

682
00:50:28,583 --> 00:50:30,542
<i>* Your keys are screamin' in high C *</i>

683
00:50:30,625 --> 00:50:32,417
<i>* Your chord, you're dripping sweat *</i>

684
00:50:33,708 --> 00:50:36,875
<i>* Now I'm runnin' up to your frequency *</i>

685
00:50:38,417 --> 00:50:41,958
<i>* The coalition of your atoms
Is freaking me *</i>

686
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:47,375
<i>* And you spillin' whole notes
Out your mouth with no rest *</i>

687
00:50:48,042 --> 00:50:51,042
<i>* You spillin' majors and minors
And sharps and clefts *</i>

688
00:50:52,792 --> 00:50:55,958
<i>* Soul drippin' off the ceiling *</i>

689
00:50:57,917 --> 00:51:00,833
<i>* Give me love with feeling *</i>

690
00:51:25,667 --> 00:51:27,125
Do you really want to find her?

691
00:52:02,292 --> 00:52:03,292
Jana?

692
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:11,125
The Americano came
to steal Jana to marry her.

693
00:52:14,542 --> 00:52:16,375
Where are you going, Rambo?

694
00:52:16,958 --> 00:52:18,083
Rasho...

695
00:52:18,167 --> 00:52:21,167
do you really think
Jana doesn't want to be stolen?

696
00:52:22,917 --> 00:52:25,375
We can hear best from the kitchen.

697
00:52:34,292 --> 00:52:36,125
What are you doing here?

698
00:52:36,708 --> 00:52:38,500
I thought you had been kidnapped.

699
00:52:38,583 --> 00:52:40,458
Kidnapped? By who?

700
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:44,458
By them? They are my friends.

701
00:52:44,542 --> 00:52:46,250
Even the family... Why do you come?

702
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:52,625
Uh, a minute ago, I, I knew but...

703
00:52:54,667 --> 00:52:56,500
the climb up here made me forget.

704
00:52:57,167 --> 00:53:00,167
Uh, oh, yeah! I remember.

705
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:02,417
- What?
- They're talking English.

706
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,625
- I don't unders...
- Ah...

707
00:53:04,708 --> 00:53:07,667
Wait. I got an app for that.

708
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:08,693
- Where?
- Come on.

709
00:53:08,708 --> 00:53:11,125
Give me the phone! Give me the phone!

710
00:53:11,208 --> 00:53:14,500
- Come on. Give him the phone.
- Eh!

711
00:53:14,583 --> 00:53:16,458
You will suffocate
with these earplugs.

712
00:53:18,458 --> 00:53:19,542
Check. Check.

713
00:53:20,458 --> 00:53:24,000
You don't have to humiliate
yourself for people to like you.

714
00:53:25,125 --> 00:53:27,792
It's called self-irony.

715
00:53:27,875 --> 00:53:33,625
You know, you make fun of your problem
and then it becomes smaller.

716
00:53:34,375 --> 00:53:35,833
But you don't have a problem.

717
00:53:36,958 --> 00:53:40,583
Excuse me, but the fact that
you are saying that, means I do.

718
00:53:40,667 --> 00:53:43,167
I'm begging you, don't become like them.

719
00:53:44,125 --> 00:53:46,500
It's from those pills they're giving you.

720
00:53:47,583 --> 00:53:48,583
Don't you get it?

721
00:53:55,375 --> 00:53:56,375
Maybe you're right.

722
00:54:00,125 --> 00:54:02,167
But I've noticed something with you, too.

723
00:54:03,042 --> 00:54:05,167
When we had our first dates...

724
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:06,958
...you were going out with me

725
00:54:07,042 --> 00:54:08,583
'cause you were getting
material gains later.

726
00:54:08,667 --> 00:54:11,833
Is that true?

727
00:54:12,417 --> 00:54:13,583
Yes, it is.

728
00:54:15,667 --> 00:54:18,042
...but that was just
the beginning.

729
00:54:18,125 --> 00:54:21,167
Then I started fighting with myself.

730
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:23,000
Something was happening inside me.

731
00:54:23,083 --> 00:54:27,792
A woman's feelings, new to me.
I wanted to stop them.

732
00:54:28,708 --> 00:54:30,667
Who said that?

733
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:33,625
Rasho, stop eating.

734
00:54:33,708 --> 00:54:34,708
Translate.

735
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:36,750
Quiet.

736
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:42,250
So then
I started getting scared.

737
00:54:44,917 --> 00:54:46,167
Scared of what?

738
00:54:48,125 --> 00:54:49,708
Scared of my feelings for you.

739
00:54:49,792 --> 00:54:51,125
Who is saying that?

740
00:54:51,208 --> 00:54:54,792
I don't understand.

741
00:55:07,625 --> 00:55:09,083
Rasho, what's going on?

742
00:55:09,167 --> 00:55:10,375
It's over.

743
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:17,792
They are not talking anymore.

744
00:55:29,083 --> 00:55:30,500
- What's wrong?
- Um...

745
00:55:31,167 --> 00:55:32,458
Nothing.

746
00:55:32,542 --> 00:55:35,542
Could you wait for me downstairs, please?

747
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:40,792
Downstairs? Alone? With those people?

748
00:55:42,208 --> 00:55:43,667
Please, Aaron, I...

749
00:55:44,417 --> 00:55:45,833
It's time for my ritual.

750
00:55:45,917 --> 00:55:47,708
I can't miss it.

751
00:55:50,417 --> 00:55:51,625
I'm sorry.

752
00:55:52,417 --> 00:55:53,402
Okay.

753
00:55:53,417 --> 00:55:54,917
- Okay?
- Yeah.

754
00:55:55,708 --> 00:55:59,333
Wait. Hurry! He's coming.

755
00:55:59,417 --> 00:56:00,708
He's coming.

756
00:56:08,458 --> 00:56:09,458
Hurry up!

757
00:56:10,458 --> 00:56:11,500
Get aside!

758
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:24,208
Any ideas?

759
00:56:25,875 --> 00:56:27,333
Only the one I was worried about.

760
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,500
- Maybe we should...
- I'm going.

761
00:56:43,083 --> 00:56:45,292
I'll open his back pocket
and you get whatever is in it.

762
00:56:45,375 --> 00:56:46,375
Hey!

763
00:56:47,958 --> 00:56:50,667
Hey!
Get away from him.

764
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:06,458
Aaron?
Aaron, are you alright?

765
00:57:08,208 --> 00:57:09,208
Oh.

766
00:57:13,333 --> 00:57:14,417
What's up, man?

767
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,250
Hey, what's up, man?

768
00:57:29,833 --> 00:57:32,000
My sister dragged you into this,
didn't she?

769
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:36,792
Oh, man.

770
00:57:38,792 --> 00:57:40,083
Hey, Doc.

771
00:57:40,167 --> 00:57:41,958
Aaron! Jesus!

772
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:44,208
No, no, no. It's not what it looks like.

773
00:57:44,292 --> 00:57:47,292
I, uh... I, um... I'm completely sane.

774
00:57:47,375 --> 00:57:50,000
I don't know what happened.
I think I lost consciousness.

775
00:57:50,083 --> 00:57:52,000
Maybe someone tried
to rob me or something.

776
00:57:52,667 --> 00:57:55,167
<i>- It's okay.</i>
- Let me refresh your memory.

777
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:57,625
I received all of these saying,
"What's up, Doc?"

778
00:58:01,167 --> 00:58:03,000
Shit!

779
00:58:03,083 --> 00:58:04,667
Exactly.

780
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:06,792
<i>Who takes a selfie with a tiger rug?</i>

781
00:58:07,958 --> 00:58:11,125
<i>And to answer your question,
"How did I lose consciousness?"</i>

782
00:58:11,208 --> 00:58:15,250
Aaron, you know we have to report
to your parole officer every month.

783
00:58:15,333 --> 00:58:16,500
What do I say to him now?

784
00:58:16,583 --> 00:58:18,042
There she is.

785
00:58:18,125 --> 00:58:21,083
Uh, Doc, I gotta go.

786
00:58:21,167 --> 00:58:22,792
No, no, Aaron, don't hang up, okay?

787
00:58:22,875 --> 00:58:24,917
This shit is serious. More than you think.

788
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,750
Rasho, is there
something you're not telling me?

789
00:58:28,833 --> 00:58:32,542
I gave him something to drink.

790
00:58:32,625 --> 00:58:34,333
From your poison?

791
00:58:34,417 --> 00:58:36,500
My whiskey is better than Johnny.

792
00:58:36,583 --> 00:58:38,917
We've poisoned him!

793
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:41,833
You ditched him with the gypsies?
Are you insane?

794
00:58:41,917 --> 00:58:44,625
- Bobby.
- He's a fighter, what could have...

795
00:58:44,708 --> 00:58:47,417
They got him drunk
with bootlegged whiskey.

796
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,917
I can't believe he's still alive.

797
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,542
Aaron, I'm sorry.

798
00:58:50,625 --> 00:58:52,167
- I shouldn't have...
- It's okay!

799
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:55,083
Actually, I was, I was having fun
until I passed out in the mud.

800
00:58:55,167 --> 00:58:57,292
Aaron, please, I wanna talk to my sister.

801
00:59:00,958 --> 00:59:02,583
You don't realise how...

802
00:59:03,708 --> 00:59:05,917
You don't realise
how important is this fight for us.

803
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,250
I want you to call it off.

804
00:59:07,333 --> 00:59:10,458
What?

805
00:59:10,542 --> 00:59:12,625
For you it might be good,
but it's not for Aaron.

806
00:59:13,208 --> 00:59:15,375
So you care more about him now?

807
00:59:15,458 --> 00:59:18,417
He's doing it for us!
I've never met anyone like him.

808
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,875
Go to a mental institution, there's sure
to be a lot of people like him.

809
00:59:20,958 --> 00:59:23,375
Don't you dare say that!

810
00:59:23,458 --> 00:59:25,792
I won't allow you to call him crazy.
He's not. I'm not.

811
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:29,917
- Jana...
- Bobby!

812
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,708
Now is not the right time.

813
00:59:31,792 --> 00:59:33,500
- Bobby!
- Michael, please shut up.

814
00:59:33,583 --> 00:59:34,583
Bobby.

815
00:59:35,042 --> 00:59:38,667
I sold the TV rights for the fight,
pay-per-view, motherfucker!

816
00:59:42,625 --> 00:59:45,125
- Wait. Wait.
- Yes.

817
01:00:05,292 --> 01:00:07,583
Hey!

818
01:00:24,042 --> 01:00:26,375
The news with the bike
was all over the net.

819
01:00:26,458 --> 01:00:31,042
Then the Bulgarian MMA federation
wanted Aaron to go to psychiatric test

820
01:00:31,125 --> 01:00:33,500
just to determine
whether he's sane or not.

821
01:00:34,042 --> 01:00:35,375
They could've just asked me.

822
01:00:36,125 --> 01:00:37,417
Anyway, there's no such test,

823
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,750
they just wanted to make sure
I was gonna play by their rules.

824
01:00:39,833 --> 01:00:40,833
Aaron, please.

825
01:00:41,333 --> 01:00:44,500
Act like you're not crazy. Okay?

826
01:00:46,625 --> 01:00:47,750
Mr. Hunter,

827
01:00:47,833 --> 01:00:50,208
my apologies, I heard you have
had issues with your memory.

828
01:00:50,292 --> 01:00:53,208
I have a few questions
regarding the MMA rules

829
01:00:53,292 --> 01:00:55,292
and your motivation
to take part in this fight.

830
01:00:56,042 --> 01:01:00,083
Mr. Hunter, my apologies,
but I heard there's some memory issues.

831
01:01:00,167 --> 01:01:02,792
And I wanna ask about MMA fight rules.

832
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:07,083
What are the forbidden
actions and hits during a fight?

833
01:01:07,167 --> 01:01:10,000
Alright, the forbidden hits and punches?

834
01:01:11,083 --> 01:01:13,500
The fighter isn't allowed
to pull the opponent's hair,

835
01:01:13,583 --> 01:01:15,125
no pokes in the eyes.

836
01:01:15,208 --> 01:01:18,917
No hits below the belt,
no kicking when the opponent is down.

837
01:01:19,458 --> 01:01:22,583
No punching in the back of the head,
no short rabbit punches.

838
01:01:36,458 --> 01:01:39,167
How many rounds are there
in the fight and how long do they last?

839
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:41,583
How many rounds
and how many minutes?

840
01:01:41,667 --> 01:01:43,000
Three rounds, five minutes each.

841
01:01:45,542 --> 01:01:47,792
In which cases
does the fight finish?

842
01:01:47,875 --> 01:01:49,667
What are the cases?

843
01:01:50,875 --> 01:01:52,375
When the fighter taps out,

844
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:54,917
or when the referee decides
he has to stop the fight.

845
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,333
Why did you decide to make
your comeback here in Bulgaria?

846
01:01:59,417 --> 01:02:03,750
Why did you decide
to make your comeback here in Bulgaria?

847
01:02:05,542 --> 01:02:07,333
I was, uh...

848
01:02:07,417 --> 01:02:10,333
I was in the car with... with Bobby.

849
01:02:10,417 --> 01:02:14,000
And, uh... a song came on the radio.

850
01:02:14,667 --> 01:02:15,667
And, uh...

851
01:02:17,375 --> 01:02:18,792
Uh, Harold Melvin.

852
01:02:19,833 --> 01:02:23,333
I told Bobby that if he would sing
the song with me,

853
01:02:23,417 --> 01:02:25,000
then I will do the fight.

854
01:02:25,583 --> 01:02:26,917
Um...

855
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,958
Oh, sorry, that's all I remember.

856
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:37,375
Uh, I noticed that
the sport is progressing quickly here.

857
01:02:37,458 --> 01:02:41,167
And that Bobby has great potential.

858
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:46,708
I told Harold Melvin,
my former coach and ex-MMA fighter,

859
01:02:46,792 --> 01:02:52,042
that he would be the best opponent.

860
01:02:52,125 --> 01:02:53,958
- Exactly.
- Yes.

861
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:57,458
I've never heard of
a fighter named Harold Melvin.

862
01:02:57,542 --> 01:03:00,667
I hadn't either,
but I didn't want to insult him.

863
01:03:12,292 --> 01:03:15,833
* <i>So come down and satisfy
The need in me</i> *

864
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:18,583
* <i>'Cause only your good loving
Can set me free</i> *

865
01:03:21,208 --> 01:03:23,042
Why the hell did you have to be so honest?

866
01:03:23,125 --> 01:03:24,708
You wanted me to lie?

867
01:03:24,792 --> 01:03:26,833
Yes, that's what normal people do.

868
01:03:26,917 --> 01:03:28,167
I'm not normal.

869
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:30,875
Shit.

870
01:03:30,958 --> 01:03:31,958
Now we're screwed.

871
01:03:35,417 --> 01:03:38,500
<i>* I can see wrong and right
Never choose a side *</i>

872
01:03:39,042 --> 01:03:41,417
<i>* Runnin' on red, not black and white *</i>

873
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:42,958
<i>* Grey is where I hide *</i>

874
01:03:43,042 --> 01:03:45,375
<i>* I'm always busy *</i>

875
01:03:45,458 --> 01:03:47,208
<i>* When they all need me *</i>

876
01:03:47,833 --> 01:03:50,042
<i>* I wanna do it *</i>

877
01:03:50,125 --> 01:03:51,833
<i>* But I'm always gone *</i>

878
01:03:52,667 --> 01:03:54,625
<i>* I wanna fight it *</i>

879
01:03:56,792 --> 01:03:58,792
- Aaron!
- He's busy.

880
01:03:58,875 --> 01:04:02,167
- I'll talk to you, too. Aaron!
- What you've come for won't happen.

881
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:05,542
You really think I came all this way
to this shithole for you to tell me.

882
01:04:05,625 --> 01:04:07,250
You're from fucking Albania!

883
01:04:07,333 --> 01:04:08,417
If we reach an agreement,

884
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:10,792
I'll sign the papers
and forget about the lawsuit.

885
01:04:10,875 --> 01:04:14,292
Why? You're still his wife.
You'll take half of his earnings, anyway.

886
01:04:14,375 --> 01:04:16,042
- Don't waste my time.
- What do you want?

887
01:04:16,125 --> 01:04:17,417
I know you'll twist things around,

888
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:20,375
- so everything ends up in your account.
- What do you want? What do you want?

889
01:04:20,458 --> 01:04:22,750
I know everything is possible
in this country.

890
01:04:25,167 --> 01:04:28,250
I want an equal partner's share.

891
01:04:28,333 --> 01:04:29,625
Equal? Partner share?

892
01:04:30,208 --> 01:04:31,458
No way, that's not happening.

893
01:04:31,542 --> 01:04:32,792
- No way?
- Yes. No way.

894
01:04:33,917 --> 01:04:35,458
- I can go lower.
- How lower?

895
01:04:36,375 --> 01:04:39,333
I can go lower if you tell me
you made him sign the insurance.

896
01:04:40,542 --> 01:04:43,042
I cannot promise you
he's gonna sign the insurance.

897
01:04:43,125 --> 01:04:45,833
And regarding the cut,
you need to talk to my other partner.

898
01:04:50,583 --> 01:04:53,333
Aaron's opponent is your business partner?

899
01:04:54,083 --> 01:04:55,083
Yes.

900
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,750
- Aaron.
- Oh, God!

901
01:05:04,875 --> 01:05:07,833
She's got what he has.
Not the same thing, Michael,

902
01:05:07,917 --> 01:05:10,458
- but it looks like that.
- It's not the same. Similar.

903
01:05:10,542 --> 01:05:12,917
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to just...

904
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,833
- Hi, Aaron.
- Evelyn?

905
01:05:16,208 --> 01:05:20,667
I was wondering why here
or why this place, but, uh...

906
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:24,500
Now I know,
and I'm happy for you, honestly.

907
01:05:25,917 --> 01:05:27,125
What are you doing here?

908
01:05:27,792 --> 01:05:29,000
Uh, I mean...

909
01:05:29,083 --> 01:05:31,542
I'm trying to help, I guess.

910
01:05:31,625 --> 01:05:35,667
And I, I see that you're in love
and the two of you have this thing...

911
01:05:36,333 --> 01:05:38,333
Excuse me, how did she get it?

912
01:05:38,417 --> 01:05:40,583
She doesn't look like
an ex-fighter.

913
01:05:41,917 --> 01:05:43,917
Oh, sorry. I'm sorry, dear.

914
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,708
How rude of me
to not even introduced myself.

915
01:05:46,792 --> 01:05:47,917
I'm Evelyn, his wife...

916
01:05:49,042 --> 01:05:50,292
Oh, fuck.

917
01:05:50,375 --> 01:05:52,667
I, I'm sorry. I didn't... I forgot!

918
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:54,833
- Evelyn, stop. Stop.
- The touching and...

919
01:05:54,917 --> 01:05:56,875
Listen. What...

920
01:05:56,958 --> 01:06:00,917
We could fix this, whatever you want.
I mean, um... You want me to sign something?

921
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,667
- Okay...
- No, no. Easy, easy.

922
01:06:03,792 --> 01:06:08,375
The important thing is that
we get the best out of this fight.

923
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:10,250
- Yeah.
- Right?

924
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:12,167
Wow.

925
01:06:13,583 --> 01:06:18,500
I don't know what to say.
You haven't sounded like this in years.

926
01:06:20,417 --> 01:06:21,417
Right.

927
01:06:22,333 --> 01:06:25,375
I guess, I'm, uh... I'm almost normal.

928
01:06:26,917 --> 01:06:27,917
Yeah.

929
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,792
Well, that's the other problem you have.

930
01:06:46,833 --> 01:06:48,625
That was his sister.

931
01:06:50,583 --> 01:06:51,583
Hey.

932
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:55,500
I came to apologise,
but the timing was bad.

933
01:06:55,583 --> 01:06:56,958
Oh. It's all right.

934
01:06:58,292 --> 01:07:01,125
Yesterday,
I looked a guy right in the eyes.

935
01:07:01,208 --> 01:07:03,417
When he walked past me,
we almost touched shoulders.

936
01:07:04,125 --> 01:07:05,667
You're still taking your pills?

937
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:07,417
Yeah, I think that's the reason.

938
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,167
You won't quit the fight, right?

939
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:10,193
No.

940
01:07:10,208 --> 01:07:12,458
It's a win-win for all of us,
you know that.

941
01:07:12,542 --> 01:07:15,042
That's the only reason
I had to act like that with Evelyn...

942
01:07:15,125 --> 01:07:17,375
And become like them.

943
01:07:17,458 --> 01:07:18,667
No, I'm getting better.

944
01:07:19,708 --> 01:07:21,750
- You're just losing yourself.
- No.

945
01:07:22,333 --> 01:07:24,542
Oh! Gosh.

946
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:26,333
Are you okay?

947
01:07:27,167 --> 01:07:29,083
Jana, what happened?

948
01:07:29,167 --> 01:07:33,042
I hit the lamppost, Dad.
Nothing new.

949
01:07:40,208 --> 01:07:42,125
I'll drive you
to the pharmacy.

950
01:07:42,208 --> 01:07:43,792
We got
to get her checked out.

951
01:07:43,875 --> 01:07:45,667
Just me. Aaron stays.

952
01:07:57,875 --> 01:07:58,875
Hey.

953
01:08:00,792 --> 01:08:03,875
Don't follow.
We are different now.

954
01:08:21,417 --> 01:08:26,667
<i>* Another world is an open door
And I feel no love *</i>

955
01:08:29,708 --> 01:08:35,042
<i>* Another world is a lonely road
And I feel no love *</i>

956
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:44,292
<i>* The mistakes that I've made
Have gone back to blame my soul *</i>

957
01:08:47,375 --> 01:08:53,500
<i>* All the chances I'll never take
They're here to come and go *</i>

958
01:08:56,083 --> 01:08:59,792
<i>* I feel mistaken *</i>

959
01:09:00,417 --> 01:09:03,458
<i>* And I was faking *</i>

960
01:09:03,542 --> 01:09:05,958
<i>* But I need your hand *</i>

961
01:09:08,167 --> 01:09:11,833
<i>* To get me through this life *</i>

962
01:09:11,917 --> 01:09:13,000
Mr. Hunter?

963
01:09:15,333 --> 01:09:16,667
I asked you a question.

964
01:09:20,708 --> 01:09:23,208
I'm sorry, I...
I was thinking about something else.

965
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:27,167
Why did you accept this fight?

966
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:30,708
Well, I said I'd do the fight
to help out Bobby and his family.

967
01:09:33,208 --> 01:09:35,292
You agreed to do this fight

968
01:09:35,375 --> 01:09:37,583
in order to help your opponent
and his family?

969
01:09:37,667 --> 01:09:40,583
I'm sorry, man. I know...
I... I shouldn't have said...

970
01:09:40,667 --> 01:09:42,250
- Aaron...
- Mr. Hunter.

971
01:09:42,333 --> 01:09:44,833
No, it's just that we didn't rehearse
this part... the question.

972
01:09:44,917 --> 01:09:46,875
The conversation
is only between the two of us.

973
01:09:46,958 --> 01:09:48,167
- Take it easy.
- It's okay.

974
01:09:49,625 --> 01:09:51,833
Hey, just answer
the question, Aaron.

975
01:09:51,917 --> 01:09:53,833
Can you please answer my question?

976
01:09:54,917 --> 01:09:56,833
You agreed to do this fight

977
01:09:56,917 --> 01:10:00,125
in order to help
your opponent and his family?

978
01:10:08,375 --> 01:10:10,125
I didn't want to do it for myself.

979
01:10:16,625 --> 01:10:18,208
Me and Bobby, we're a lot alike,

980
01:10:19,708 --> 01:10:24,542
only I've been able to achieve
almost everything he's always wanted.

981
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,625
And it came easy for me.

982
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:33,500
I didn't even enjoy my success.

983
01:10:36,458 --> 01:10:37,583
I keep thinking that...

984
01:10:39,208 --> 01:10:41,083
I've gotten way too much out of life.

985
01:10:42,375 --> 01:10:44,500
That's why I keep living with this...

986
01:10:45,917 --> 01:10:47,458
sense of guilt.

987
01:10:50,875 --> 01:10:55,000
So I figured, uh... in order to feel good,

988
01:10:55,583 --> 01:10:58,417
I should not do it for myself.

989
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:03,417
I need to do something for someone else.

990
01:11:08,958 --> 01:11:10,708
And I've achieved a lot.

991
01:11:10,792 --> 01:11:13,958
But, hey, listen,
I never really had a family.

992
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,333
And since I've been...

993
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:20,542
Since I've come here...

994
01:11:25,125 --> 01:11:27,542
I started feeling something
very close to that.

995
01:11:31,833 --> 01:11:34,083
I guess you know I forget stuff.

996
01:11:36,417 --> 01:11:38,750
Big chunks of my life are...

997
01:11:40,667 --> 01:11:41,708
missing.

998
01:11:43,208 --> 01:11:46,625
People say your memory is what makes you...

999
01:11:48,917 --> 01:11:49,917
what you are.

1000
01:11:51,208 --> 01:11:52,417
That, uh...

1001
01:11:53,417 --> 01:11:55,625
That's the reason to keep living.

1002
01:12:00,417 --> 01:12:03,583
If I can't remember, at least...

1003
01:12:04,667 --> 01:12:08,625
at least I have people around
that remember me.

1004
01:12:35,625 --> 01:12:37,750
Life. Nothing else.

1005
01:12:37,833 --> 01:12:39,917
Work accident, injury, life.

1006
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,292
Michael, tell me what I don't know,
or I swear...

1007
01:12:42,375 --> 01:12:43,833
Aaron has punch-drunk syndrome.

1008
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,125
He takes pills for Alzheimer's,
but it's damaging his brain...

1009
01:12:48,208 --> 01:12:50,625
- I know what it is, Michael.
- What do you want from me?

1010
01:12:52,917 --> 01:12:54,708
For 15 years, I've been his nanny.

1011
01:12:55,292 --> 01:12:58,042
I have no life. I have nobody.

1012
01:12:58,125 --> 01:13:01,792
He couldn't do anything without me.
Then he blows it all to shit.

1013
01:13:02,583 --> 01:13:04,917
I lost everything I got.

1014
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:08,958
No one wanted to hire me
after what happened to Aaron.

1015
01:13:09,792 --> 01:13:13,208
And right now, I'm just a babysitter
to a retarded kid.

1016
01:13:13,292 --> 01:13:14,292
Don't say that.

1017
01:13:14,375 --> 01:13:16,167
- You don't know what it's like.
- I don't?

1018
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:17,833
- You don't.
- I don't know what it's like?

1019
01:13:17,917 --> 01:13:18,917
Bobby, stop it.

1020
01:13:20,625 --> 01:13:22,708
The chances of that happening are minimal.

1021
01:13:24,292 --> 01:13:27,833
Look, me and Michael,
we gave our lives to Aaron.

1022
01:13:28,875 --> 01:13:30,917
Don't you think
if something happened to him,

1023
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,833
we don't deserve to get any recognition
for our efforts?

1024
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:35,708
Recognition?

1025
01:13:35,792 --> 01:13:39,083
You could always end the fight
by submitting him or something.

1026
01:13:39,167 --> 01:13:40,750
He would remember to tap out?

1027
01:13:42,125 --> 01:13:43,542
You think he's that rational?

1028
01:14:04,125 --> 01:14:05,792
I came from the hall.

1029
01:14:06,917 --> 01:14:10,417
Aaron is... I don't know how to...

1030
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:14,458
I want to have nothing
to do with this anymore.

1031
01:14:15,667 --> 01:14:16,667
Uh-huh.

1032
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,375
Remember what your grandma
used to tell me when you were little?

1033
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:25,750
She used to say,

1034
01:14:26,625 --> 01:14:31,083
"Why do you want to punish her?
She is in her own world."

1035
01:14:32,958 --> 01:14:34,583
How do you know that's wrong there?

1036
01:14:37,292 --> 01:14:42,417
How do you know about his? Or ours?

1037
01:14:53,792 --> 01:14:55,625
What's wrong? Why are you sitting?

1038
01:14:55,708 --> 01:14:57,542
- Don't know. It's all good.
- Ah.

1039
01:14:58,750 --> 01:15:00,208
Why are you so stiff?
Do I have to deal with you too now?

1040
01:15:00,292 --> 01:15:01,417
What do you mean?

1041
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:04,042
Doesn't matter. Come on!

1042
01:15:11,917 --> 01:15:15,417
- Faster! What are you?
- What am I?

1043
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:17,458
- What?
- What am I?

1044
01:15:17,542 --> 01:15:20,208
You are a state champion! Say it!

1045
01:15:20,292 --> 01:15:22,333
- I'm a champion.
- Louder!

1046
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:25,750
- I'm a champion.
- Louder!

1047
01:15:26,875 --> 01:15:29,833
- I'm a champion.
- Louder!

1048
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:36,042
- I'm a mean motherfucker!
- I'm a mean motherfucker!

1049
01:15:45,167 --> 01:15:47,833
- I'll destroy anyone who comes in my way!
- I will destroy anyone...

1050
01:15:53,917 --> 01:15:57,125
- I'm a terminator!
- I'm a terminator!

1051
01:17:04,333 --> 01:17:08,750
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the main event of the evening.

1052
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:14,042
In the red corner, we have
a fighter with a professional record

1053
01:17:14,125 --> 01:17:19,875
of seven wins, two losses
and one no contest.

1054
01:17:19,958 --> 01:17:22,708
Fighting out of Bansko, Bulgaria,

1055
01:17:22,792 --> 01:17:25,458
Borislav "Good Night" Tumbev!

1056
01:17:27,542 --> 01:17:28,792
In the blue corner,

1057
01:17:28,875 --> 01:17:33,042
please, give it up for the fighter
with the professional record

1058
01:17:33,125 --> 01:17:36,208
of 52 wins and only eight defeats.

1059
01:17:36,292 --> 01:17:40,542
The MMA legend,
fighting out of Brooklyn, New York,

1060
01:17:40,625 --> 01:17:44,250
Aaron "Lionheart" Hunter!

1061
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:51,250
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Our tale of the tape is here.

1062
01:17:51,958 --> 01:17:56,042
As you can see, Hunter is taller
and has a slight reach advantage.

1063
01:17:56,125 --> 01:17:57,917
Tumbev is ten years younger, though.

1064
01:17:58,542 --> 01:18:01,250
Yes,
but that doesn't help his Efbet odds.

1065
01:18:01,333 --> 01:18:04,375
Six to one for him being the underdog
and Hunter the favourite.

1066
01:18:06,167 --> 01:18:07,875
Fighters, please come up.

1067
01:18:07,958 --> 01:18:11,083
The referee looks like
he's ready to start, but...

1068
01:18:11,167 --> 01:18:14,542
Aaron Hunter seems
a little distracted, don't you think?

1069
01:18:15,167 --> 01:18:17,583
Could he be in love?

1070
01:18:18,958 --> 01:18:21,625
Okay. Protect yourself at all times.

1071
01:18:22,958 --> 01:18:24,500
Follow my instructions.

1072
01:18:26,458 --> 01:18:30,042
If you don't have any questions,
touch gloves,

1073
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:32,417
and let's go.

1074
01:18:38,542 --> 01:18:40,292
- Fighter, are you ready?
- Yes.

1075
01:18:41,458 --> 01:18:43,000
Fighter, are you ready?

1076
01:18:45,375 --> 01:18:47,458
Fight!

1077
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,125
And the fight is underway!

1078
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,833
Tumbev attacks.

1079
01:18:58,917 --> 01:19:02,250
But Hunter is really acting weird.

1080
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:08,667
Don't hold back.

1081
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:10,583
Fight!

1082
01:19:19,375 --> 01:19:20,375
Fight!

1083
01:19:21,542 --> 01:19:25,333
Tumbev! Tumbev! Tumbev!

1084
01:19:55,917 --> 01:19:56,917
Come on!

1085
01:20:12,875 --> 01:20:15,208
Come on, Aaron! Defend yourself!

1086
01:20:15,292 --> 01:20:18,125
Come on, listen to me! Defend yourself.

1087
01:20:31,667 --> 01:20:32,667
Stop.

1088
01:20:33,208 --> 01:20:36,750
And that is the end
of the most devastating round to watch

1089
01:20:36,833 --> 01:20:38,500
in the history of this sport.

1090
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:40,500
Well, if you're calling this a sport,

1091
01:20:40,583 --> 01:20:42,417
I think you might've been watching
something else.

1092
01:20:45,667 --> 01:20:47,042
Come on, man, fight!

1093
01:20:50,625 --> 01:20:53,125
Hunter is going
to his opponent's corner.

1094
01:20:54,667 --> 01:20:56,667
- Tell me something...
- Aaron, what are you doing?

1095
01:20:56,750 --> 01:20:57,792
Go back.

1096
01:20:57,875 --> 01:20:59,583
It looks like
he's talking to him.

1097
01:20:59,667 --> 01:21:01,458
We have to fight.
We're gonna lose everything.

1098
01:21:01,542 --> 01:21:03,208
- You don't understand...
- Go back! Go back!

1099
01:21:12,208 --> 01:21:15,250
If you don't start
fighting, the people will...

1100
01:21:15,333 --> 01:21:17,417
Want their money back. I know.

1101
01:21:21,250 --> 01:21:23,708
I have never seen
anything like this before.

1102
01:21:23,792 --> 01:21:25,958
I think we'll be seeing that
more than once tonight.

1103
01:21:46,917 --> 01:21:48,667
Aaron?

1104
01:22:14,667 --> 01:22:15,667
Aaron?

1105
01:22:40,542 --> 01:22:42,125
Fight!

1106
01:22:53,250 --> 01:22:56,417
If you don't attack,
this fight will be a no contest.

1107
01:22:57,083 --> 01:22:58,083
Fight.

1108
01:23:20,458 --> 01:23:22,083
Nobody wants to hear you sing, Aaron.

1109
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,667
Evelyn's going to take your money.

1110
01:23:26,875 --> 01:23:28,583
Michael is going to disappear.

1111
01:23:28,667 --> 01:23:31,000
My sister doesn't care about you either!

1112
01:23:32,208 --> 01:23:34,542
So start fighting, you idiot!

1113
01:23:37,292 --> 01:23:40,125
<i>* Don't leave me this way *</i>

1114
01:23:42,417 --> 01:23:46,875
<i>* I can't survive, I can't stay alive *</i>

1115
01:23:46,958 --> 01:23:49,333
<i>* Without your love *</i>

1116
01:23:51,625 --> 01:23:55,542
<i>* Don't leave me this way, no *</i>

1117
01:23:56,625 --> 01:23:58,500
<i>* I can't exist *</i>

1118
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:03,375
<i>* I'll surely miss your tender kiss *</i>

1119
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:09,167
<i>* Don't leave me this way, no *</i>

1120
01:24:09,958 --> 01:24:14,333
<i>* Don't leave me this way *</i>

1121
01:24:15,083 --> 01:24:19,750
<i>* I'm a broken man with empty hands *</i>

1122
01:24:20,542 --> 01:24:22,708
<i>* Oh, baby, please, please *</i>

1123
01:24:22,792 --> 01:24:25,875
<i>* Don't leave me this way *</i>

1124
01:24:28,250 --> 01:24:33,375
<i>* Baby, my heart is full of love
And desire for you *</i>

1125
01:24:33,958 --> 01:24:37,417
<i>* Now come on down
And do what you've got to do *</i>

1126
01:24:38,208 --> 01:24:41,875
<i>* You started this fire down in my soul *</i>

1127
01:24:41,958 --> 01:24:45,625
<i>* Now can't you see it's burning
Out of control *</i>

1128
01:24:45,708 --> 01:24:49,000
<i>* Just come down
And satisfy the need in me *</i>

1129
01:24:49,958 --> 01:24:53,333
<i>* 'Cause only your good loving
Can set me free *</i>

1130
01:24:54,333 --> 01:24:55,500
<i>* Free, free *</i>

1131
01:24:56,375 --> 01:24:59,875
<i>* Don't leave me this way *</i>

1132
01:25:01,125 --> 01:25:03,000
<i>* 'Cause it would be wrong *</i>

1133
01:25:04,208 --> 01:25:08,292
<i>* To string along with love so true *</i>

1134
01:25:09,333 --> 01:25:13,333
Ladies and gentlemen,
due to illegal actions,

1135
01:25:13,417 --> 01:25:16,375
Aaron Hunter is disqualified,

1136
01:25:16,458 --> 01:25:20,875
and the winner
is Borislav "Good Night" Tumbev.

1137
01:25:29,542 --> 01:25:32,583
<i>And as they say,
that's all she wrote.</i>

1138
01:25:32,667 --> 01:25:33,667
<i>Good night.</i>

1139
01:25:35,375 --> 01:25:36,750
<i>That's all she wrote.</i>

1140
01:25:38,792 --> 01:25:40,750
<i>Where did that saying come from, anyway?</i>

1141
01:25:41,708 --> 01:25:43,167
<i>Let tell you the story I heard.</i>

1142
01:25:44,125 --> 01:25:45,375
<i>During the Second World War,</i>

1143
01:25:45,458 --> 01:25:48,375
<i>it wasn't uncommon
for an overseas service man</i>

1144
01:25:48,458 --> 01:25:52,833
<i>to receive a brief, cutting letter
from a girlfriend</i>

1145
01:25:52,917 --> 01:25:55,583
<i>telling him that their romance was over,</i>

1146
01:25:55,667 --> 01:25:58,667
<i>and that she'd found someone else
in his absence.</i>

1147
01:25:59,542 --> 01:26:01,958
<i>When questioned by his buddies,</i>

1148
01:26:02,042 --> 01:26:04,958
<i>the anguished soldier
would give a response</i>

1149
01:26:05,042 --> 01:26:09,417
<i>that became so common
it entered our language</i>

1150
01:26:10,125 --> 01:26:11,833
<i>as meaning "It's over."</i>

1151
01:26:26,375 --> 01:26:30,125
<i>Nowadays, fight commentators
use this in cases just like this.</i>

1152
01:26:31,083 --> 01:26:33,167
<i>I mean, not just like this,</i>

1153
01:26:33,250 --> 01:26:36,333
<i>a freaked out fighter who beats the shit
out of everyone in the ring,</i>

1154
01:26:36,417 --> 01:26:38,875
<i>but a regular knockout.</i>

1155
01:26:39,750 --> 01:26:41,417
<i>Anyway, I think you got the point.</i>

1156
01:27:06,792 --> 01:27:12,583
Yes, mother. No, she's...

1157
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:19,542
Okay, just calm down. We'll find her.

1158
01:27:19,625 --> 01:27:23,333
I'll bring her back. I promise.

1159
01:27:37,042 --> 01:27:38,875
I really thought he was getting better.

1160
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:43,083
The strange thing is that
the meds don't work anymore.

1161
01:27:48,167 --> 01:27:50,042
Sorry you had to come all this way, but...

1162
01:27:52,792 --> 01:27:55,583
If it wasn't for me,
Aaron wouldn't be here.

1163
01:28:03,458 --> 01:28:06,125
I'll admit, he doesn't show
any signs of aggression,

1164
01:28:08,542 --> 01:28:11,625
but we need a relative
or a close friend to vouch for him.

1165
01:28:12,208 --> 01:28:14,625
His wife and his manager think
it will be good idea

1166
01:28:14,708 --> 01:28:18,750
for him to stay here a while,
and, quite frankly, I agree with them.

1167
01:28:19,708 --> 01:28:22,833
So I just can't release him to you
because you want me to.

1168
01:28:29,875 --> 01:28:32,208
Are there any cameras here in the office?

1169
01:28:33,708 --> 01:28:35,333
Uh, no.

1170
01:28:42,958 --> 01:28:45,542
Wait, wait! I'm not crazy! Wait.

1171
01:28:48,583 --> 01:28:49,583
Or maybe I am.

1172
01:28:52,667 --> 01:28:53,667
So...

1173
01:28:55,375 --> 01:28:57,417
It's all I won from the fight.
It's in US dollars.

1174
01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:59,333
And it's all I've got, Doc.

1175
01:29:15,833 --> 01:29:17,875
I've been working here 17 years.

1176
01:29:18,542 --> 01:29:21,750
I make sure the "strange" people
don't bother the normal ones.

1177
01:29:22,917 --> 01:29:25,792
The longer I spend with my patients, the...

1178
01:29:25,875 --> 01:29:26,958
the worse I feel.

1179
01:29:30,875 --> 01:29:33,333
Are we normal? Who are we to judge?

1180
01:29:35,292 --> 01:29:39,708
After all, I deeply doubt that any of them
would do what I'm about to do.

1181
01:29:41,792 --> 01:29:44,833
You've been here all morning.
I heard your whole wacked-out story.

1182
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,667
Could you tell me, please,

1183
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:51,583
why would you waste my time instead
of starting straight off with this?

1184
01:29:54,167 --> 01:29:56,250
<i>* Someone once told me that *</i>

1185
01:29:58,917 --> 01:30:01,792
<i>* Love is often blind *</i>

1186
01:30:02,792 --> 01:30:06,458
<i>* And as I wait for life to pass *</i>

1187
01:30:08,750 --> 01:30:11,458
<i>* I should just take my time *</i>

1188
01:30:12,125 --> 01:30:16,375
<i>* To know that I, I'm just a servant *</i>

1189
01:30:18,750 --> 01:30:21,833
<i>* And I'm listening for my cue *</i>

1190
01:30:22,875 --> 01:30:26,583
<i>* If I'm faithful and I'm certain *</i>

1191
01:30:27,417 --> 01:30:31,042
<i>* I'd be blessed
To sing this song with you *</i>

1192
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:45,667
<i>* Someone told me about our love *</i>

1193
01:30:48,458 --> 01:30:51,333
<i>* Could chase away the fear *</i>

1194
01:30:52,292 --> 01:30:55,917
<i>* Something from the light above *</i>

1195
01:30:58,292 --> 01:31:01,208
<i>* Whisper like an angel in my ear *</i>

1196
01:31:02,208 --> 01:31:07,292
<i>* That I, I'm just a soul child *</i>

1197
01:31:08,750 --> 01:31:11,542
<i>* Trying to find my way *</i>

1198
01:31:13,708 --> 01:31:16,500
<i>* Searching for a little joy *</i>

1199
01:31:17,458 --> 01:31:21,333
<i>* To spread throughout my day *</i>

1200
01:31:21,417 --> 01:31:27,500
<i>* Ooh, ooh, ooh, *</i>

1201
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:34,417
<i>* Hey, hey *</i>

1202
01:31:35,458 --> 01:31:38,125
<i>* Alright, yeah *</i>

1203
01:31:46,708 --> 01:31:50,167
<i>* Someone told me have some faith *</i>

1204
01:31:52,125 --> 01:31:55,000
<i>* The creator has a master plan *</i>

1205
01:31:56,250 --> 01:31:59,375
<i>* The truest love should never wait *</i>

1206
01:32:01,708 --> 01:32:04,792
<i>* Let our spirit shine and take a stand *</i>

1207
01:32:06,417 --> 01:32:09,625
<i>* Keep your head up strong *</i>

1208
01:32:11,750 --> 01:32:14,667
<i>* Just stay open to the solitude *</i>

1209
01:32:15,333 --> 01:32:20,000
<i>* And if I'm faithful and I'm certain *</i>

1210
01:32:20,083 --> 01:32:23,583
<i>* I'll be blessed
To sing this song with you *</i>

1211
01:32:23,667 --> 01:32:26,083
<i>* With you *</i>

1212
01:32:26,167 --> 01:32:29,583
<i>* Sun is so golden I'm gonna try
And meet with madness *</i>

1213
01:32:30,625 --> 01:32:32,792
<i>* Always in my reverie without one tune *</i>

1214
01:32:32,875 --> 01:32:35,875
<i>* Complacency, I'm gonna chime in
And strike up a tune *</i>

1215
01:32:36,458 --> 01:32:39,167
<i>* Not one, like I would cling on
But sing *</i>

1216
01:32:39,958 --> 01:32:43,000
<i>* Floaty and well hung
I'll stop for one song *</i>

1217
01:32:43,583 --> 01:32:47,750
<i>* With that said, gotta stay down
And I'll commit murderous mistakes *</i>

1218
01:32:48,333 --> 01:32:51,917
<i>* And forgive myself if I fail
You will be embarrassed for me *</i>

1219
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,458
<i>* For I simply do not have the time *</i>

1220
01:32:54,542 --> 01:32:56,708
<i>* You will make a prodigious effort
To stop me *</i>

1221
01:32:56,792 --> 01:32:59,333
<i>* But I will become stuck on your arm
Like a fox, baby *</i>

1222
01:32:59,417 --> 01:33:01,792
<i>* Hard to shake and easy to lose *</i>

1223
01:33:01,875 --> 01:33:04,792
<i>* Eventually, sealing up
The memories of the blues *</i>

1224
01:33:04,875 --> 01:33:07,417
<i>* Eventually, sealing up
The memories of the blues *</i>

1225
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:10,292
<i>* Eventually, sealing up
The memories of the blues *</i>

1226
01:33:12,042 --> 01:33:14,250
<i>* 'Cause I can see the duplicity *</i>

1227
01:33:14,792 --> 01:33:16,750
<i>* If your one half wants to judge *</i>

1228
01:33:16,833 --> 01:33:19,208
<i>* While the other just wants to be free *</i>

1229
01:33:19,292 --> 01:33:21,625
<i>* To be free, to be free *</i>

1230
01:33:21,708 --> 01:33:22,708
<i>* To be free *</i>

1231
01:33:24,167 --> 01:33:26,125
<i>* Shoot me with a shot of love *</i>

1232
01:33:26,708 --> 01:33:29,000
<i>* Shoot me with a shot of love *</i>

1233
01:33:29,083 --> 01:33:31,375
<i>* Shoot me with a shot of love *</i>

1234
01:33:31,458 --> 01:33:33,875
<i>* Shoot me with a shot of love *</i>

1235
01:33:33,958 --> 01:33:36,333
<i>* Shoot me with a shot of love *</i>

1236
01:33:36,417 --> 01:33:38,708
<i>* Shoot me with a shot of love *</i>

1237
01:33:38,792 --> 01:33:41,208
<i>* Shoot me with a shot of love *</i>

1238
01:33:41,292 --> 01:33:43,708
<i>* Shoot me with a shot of love *</i>

1239
01:33:45,833 --> 01:33:48,417
<i>I thought Aaron
and Jana were going to change.</i>

1240
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:49,500
<i>I was wrong.</i>

1241
01:33:49,583 --> 01:33:51,167
<i>The old problems came back.</i>

1242
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:52,833
But that's nothing new.

1243
01:33:54,375 --> 01:33:56,125
<i>* Can you hear me? *</i>

1244
01:33:57,125 --> 01:33:58,792
<i>* Can you hear me? *</i>

1245
01:33:59,458 --> 01:34:01,083
<i>* Can you hear me? *</i>

1246
01:34:02,042 --> 01:34:03,958
<i>* Can you hear me singing? *</i>

1247
01:34:04,583 --> 01:34:06,083
<i>* Whoa, yeah *</i>

1248
01:34:09,625 --> 01:34:11,500
<i>* Whoa, yeah *</i>

1249
01:34:21,125 --> 01:34:24,583
<i>* And if I'm patient and I'm thankful *</i>

1250
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:36,083
<i>* I'll be blessed
To sing this song for you *</i>

1251
01:34:56,583 --> 01:34:59,042
<i>* I see the wrong and right *</i>

1252
01:34:59,125 --> 01:35:00,833
<i>* Never choose a side *</i>

1253
01:35:01,458 --> 01:35:03,833
<i>* Runnin' on red, not black and white *</i>

1254
01:35:03,917 --> 01:35:05,375
<i>* Grey is where I hide *</i>

1255
01:35:05,458 --> 01:35:07,750
<i>* I'm always busy *</i>

1256
01:35:07,833 --> 01:35:09,458
<i>* When they all need me *</i>

1257
01:35:10,250 --> 01:35:12,417
<i>* I wanna do it *</i>

1258
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:14,292
<i>* But I'm always gone *</i>

1259
01:35:15,042 --> 01:35:17,375
<i>* I wanna fight it *</i>

1260
01:35:17,458 --> 01:35:19,750
<i>* Instead, I listen *</i>

1261
01:35:19,833 --> 01:35:21,542
<i>* But now I'm different *</i>

1262
01:35:21,625 --> 01:35:24,583
<i>* Found room to grow *</i>

1263
01:35:24,667 --> 01:35:27,625
<i>* Gonna kick the pieces of my shell now *</i>

1264
01:35:27,708 --> 01:35:30,125
<i>* Start a brand new story *</i>

1265
01:35:30,208 --> 01:35:33,583
<i>* Open up my heart again *</i>

1266
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:37,208
<i>* Gonna let that little bird out *</i>

1267
01:35:37,292 --> 01:35:39,875
<i>* See the song unfolding *</i>

1268
01:35:39,958 --> 01:35:42,250
<i>* Listen, everybody *</i>

1269
01:35:42,333 --> 01:35:45,917
<i>* This is what I'm all about *</i>

1270
01:35:47,333 --> 01:35:49,458
<i>* I don't know where we're goin'd</i>

1271
01:35:49,542 --> 01:35:52,042
<i>* But I know what's drivin' me *</i>

1272
01:35:52,125 --> 01:35:54,875
<i>* I know there's something in my mind *</i>

1273
01:35:54,958 --> 01:35:56,917
<i>* The better part of me *</i>

1274
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:01,583
<i>* I know that someone else
Will see the funny side of me *</i>

1275
01:36:01,667 --> 01:36:04,292
<i>* I know that
Once you've learned to care *</i>

1276
01:36:04,375 --> 01:36:08,167
<i>* You'll see the little things *</i>

1277
01:36:08,750 --> 01:36:12,917
<i>* I can see wrong and right
Never choose a side *</i>

1278
01:36:13,458 --> 01:36:15,833
