- It means having fun.

10
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,917
- Just like we were
having outside?

Come on.

33
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:14,833

34
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:15,667
Let me go!

35
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:18,375
Sarah!
- Don't worry.

36
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:19,708
I gotta go, bye.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,833
Laurie.

38
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:25,417
Laurie!

00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:28,292
Laurie!

00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,083
Laurie!

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,833
Laurie!

42
00:02:38,542 --> 00:02:39,375
Laurie!

43
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:44,458
Laurie.

44
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:46,667
Laurie.

45
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:49,708
Are you ready?

46
00:02:51,917 --> 00:02:53,042
We need to go.

47
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,125
Hey, you okay?

48
00:03:03,042 --> 00:03:03,875
- Yeah.

49
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,542
(crying)

50
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,583
It's all my fault.

51
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,042
- What are you talking about?

52
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:20,250
- Mom and Dad were driving down
to see me, Sarah, in my car.

53
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,292
- No, Laurie, it
was an accident.

54
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:27,500
- They were only on
that road because of me.

55
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,625
- And that is what
they would have wanted.

56
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,208
They were doing
what they loved most

57
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:35,500
and what they've done from
the minute we both were born.

58
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,833
They were looking after us.

59
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:38,542
- Sarah.

60
00:03:40,167 --> 00:03:41,000
Sarah.

61
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,083
- They died happy.

62
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,875
Oh, as happy as the day
that you came home to us.

63
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,167
And they went together.

64
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:56,000
Like two people who really
love each other should.

65
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:00,083
Come on.

66
00:04:01,417 --> 00:04:03,500
We've got a church
full of people waiting.

67
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,542
- John and Marie Kinmount
exemplified the values

68
00:04:13,542 --> 00:04:15,042
of home and family.

69
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,833
They understood that a strong
family could only take root

70
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:21,542
in a community that looked
after everyone's needs.

71
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,667
They left this
world a better place

72
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,875
and they leave behind
two fine young women

73
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,917
who embody their values.

74
00:04:30,917 --> 00:04:32,625
One a county prosecutor,

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,125
the other an honor student
with a bright future.

76
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,833
John and Marie never asked
anything for their good works.

77
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:46,667
They conquered great adversity
with an amazing grace.

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,458
In their memory,

79
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,875
please join me in singing
their favorite hymn.

80
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:58,083
♪ Amazing grace, how
sweet the sound ♪

81
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,583
♪ That saved a wretch like me ♪

82
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:20,333
(Laurie screams)

83
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,417
- Laurie.

84
00:05:21,417 --> 00:05:23,833
(crowd murmuring)

85
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,458
- Is she all right?

86
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,458
- Come on, I'm a doctor.

87
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:30,500
Come on here, come on.

88
00:05:31,917 --> 00:05:34,667
You're all right, you're
all right, yes, you're okay.

89
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:36,542
Huh?

90
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:38,292
You're okay.

91
00:05:39,292 --> 00:05:40,833
Huh?

92
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:41,667
That's good.

93
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,458
Just a little overwhelmed.

94
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,000
Would be best if she went home.

95
00:05:50,542 --> 00:05:53,833
(church bell ringing)

96
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,750
- I don't know
what came over me.

97
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,583
It was so weird, I've
never fainted before.

98
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,292
- Well, you've
been through a lot.

99
00:06:01,292 --> 00:06:02,625
Let me get this.

100
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,625
- And don't be too hard
on yourself, my dear.

101
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,167
These things happen.

102
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:11,125
- Do I know you?

103
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,750
- No, we just came
to pay our respects.

104
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,333
Now forget me and let your
big sister take care of you.

105
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:22,375
- You both have been so kind.

106
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,042
I haven't even asked
you your names.

107
00:06:24,042 --> 00:06:27,208
- Hawkins, Billy
Hawkins, my wife Carla.

108
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:28,667
- Our condolences.

109
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:29,500
- Allan Grant.

110
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,625
What kind of doctor are you?

111
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,000
- Pardon me?

112
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,667
- What kind of doctor are you?

113
00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:37,833
- Oh, philosophy actually.

114
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,333
It looked like you
needed somebody

115
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,167
to take control of
the situation, so.

116
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,708
- [Carla] And Billy's a
good judge of human nature.

117
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,000
He just understands.

118
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,375
- Television.

119
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:49,708
You're that Random
Acts of Generosity guy.

120
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,000
- Actually, he's
the competition.

121
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,833
My message is more
about helping others

122
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,625
in order to help yourself.

123
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,000
- [Allan] Good work feels great.

124
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,875
- Pays well too.

125
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,667
Your parents were
wonderful people, Sarah.

126
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:04,292
I want you to know their
lives were much appreciated.

127
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,333
- Thank you.

128
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,208
- And now go.

129
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:10,625
Take care.

130
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,500
You and Laurie make
a lovely couple.

131
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,167
- Oh, we're not.

132
00:07:17,167 --> 00:07:18,875
I'm her English professor.

133
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,167
- Oh.

134
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:23,000
Forgive me, you seemed so close.

135
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,875
- (laughs) Billy.

136
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,208
Did you really have to do that?

137
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,167
- I needed to be certain.

138
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:34,000
- And are you?

139
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:36,542
- I'm not sure.

140
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:42,167
(dramatic music)

141
00:07:45,417 --> 00:07:48,333
(Laurie screaming)

142
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:53,500
- Laurie, Laurie, it's okay.

143
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,583
It's okay.

144
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,333
Honey, it's a nightmare.

145
00:07:59,917 --> 00:08:02,667
(Laurie gasping)

146
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,667
- The knife, Sarah.

147
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:12,042
The knife's back.

148
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,458
- When Laurie was four
years old, she was abducted.

149
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,667
And she was gone for two years.

150
00:08:23,667 --> 00:08:25,333
It was hell for my parents.

151
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,542
Me too.

152
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:28,625
I was babysitting
her when it happened.

153
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:31,917
She was eventually found alone
and lost near Pittsburgh.

154
00:08:31,917 --> 00:08:33,542
- What was she like
when she came home?

155
00:08:33,542 --> 00:08:34,375
- Different.

156
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:36,833
Afraid to go to bed.

157
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,708
She refused my
father's attention

158
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,583
and even then I was
sure she'd been abused

159
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,333
but she didn't
remember anything.

160
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:44,792
- Did she have a thorough
medical examination

161
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:46,250
after she was found?

162
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,042
- Mm-hmm, she had a few
sessions with a psychiatrist

163
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:50,500
but my parents never
said what went on.

164
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,958
- Yes, pretend it
didn't happen was

165
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,208
the prevailing
attitude of the time.

166
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,167
Most people felt that
if you ignored abuse,

167
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:56,875
it would just be forgotten.

168
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,917
- And I guess I did the same.

169
00:08:58,917 --> 00:09:00,458
Laurie seemed to get better.

170
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,083
She even dated in high school.

171
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,750
She was never really
interested in men

172
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,000
until Gregg Bennett
came along last year.

173
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And then she ended that.

174
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,833
- How's she been since
your parents' deaths?

175
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,500
- She's been having nightmares.

176
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:15,875
The same one she had as a child.

177
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,667
And I feel so responsible.

178
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:19,042
- What kind of nightmares?

179
00:09:19,042 --> 00:09:20,500
- There's just one.

180
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,625
She calls it the knife dream.

181
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,292
In it, someone cuts her throat.

182
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,333
Dr. Donnelly, I feel
uncomfortable talking

183
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,833
about Laurie like this but--

184
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,542
- But I've consulted on
half a dozen of your cases

185
00:09:31,542 --> 00:09:33,667
and you didn't know
who else to approach.

186
00:09:33,667 --> 00:09:35,833
- Thank you for agreeing
to meet with me.

187
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,583
Can you recommend
anyone who can help?

188
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:38,417
- No.

189
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,042
I have an open
appointment tomorrow.

190
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,292
You don't think I'm qualified.

191
00:09:46,292 --> 00:09:47,708
- No, you're one

192
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,667
of the most respected
psychiatrists in the state.

193
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:51,375
I can't ask you to treat Laurie.

194
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,000
- Well, all you'll do is
convince her to see me.

195
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,417
She'll decide who treats her.

196
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,250
- Well, that may be
the hardest part.

197
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,167
He's a wonderful doctor, Laur.

198
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,667
- I don't need to see a shrink,

199
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:06,333
I need to get on with my life
and go back to my classes.

200
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,292
- Okay, but wouldn't
it be easier

201
00:10:07,292 --> 00:10:08,667
if you got a good night's sleep?

202
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:10,958
- The dream doesn't
happen every night.

203
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,042
- Do you remember the
sleepwalking case I prosecuted?

204
00:10:13,042 --> 00:10:14,208
The guy who killed his wife

205
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,000
while fighting monsters
in his nightmares?

206
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,167
- Yeah, I remember.

207
00:10:17,167 --> 00:10:18,708
- Well, the defense
had three psychiatrists

208
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,500
who all claimed it was possible.

209
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,958
In 10 minutes,

210
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,333
Dr. Donnelly completed
destroyed their argument.

211
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,167
And he's an expert.

212
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:26,167
- Sarah.

213
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,667
- One appointment.

214
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:30,167
And if you don't like him,
I won't mention it again.

215
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:31,917
- I'll think about it.

216
00:10:31,917 --> 00:10:34,417
Now I've got to get back
to this English paper.

217
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:36,125
I'm gonna be up
all night as it is.

218
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,333
- Okay.

219
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,167
Just, I need an
answer by the morning.

220
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:40,833
- I promise.

221
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:41,667
Bye.

222
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:42,458
- Bye.

223
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,000
- The message of the
universe is clear.

224
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,167
Good work feels great.

225
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:53,333
Give up your life and you
receive a hundredfold.

226
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,333
You've all felt it.

227
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,667
Buy a bum a cup of coffee.

228
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:58,958
Toss a street kid a quarter.

229
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,208
You feel good, you feel great.

230
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:06,333
But I know you're asking
"Where's my cup of coffee?

231
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,833
"Who's got a quarter for me?"

232
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,042
Right?

233
00:11:10,042 --> 00:11:14,542
Remember, good work feels great

234
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:17,417
and being rich feels
a whole lot better.

235
00:11:17,417 --> 00:11:19,708
Let me show you how.

236
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,208
- [Man] And cut.

237
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,167
- Bravo, Billy.

238
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:23,750
That was your best show ever.

239
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:28,500
The warehouse won't be able to
keep up with all the orders.

240
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,583
Do you think maybe we could
get away for a few weeks,

241
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:31,417
somewhere warm?

242
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:34,833
- I've been thinking
about the girl.

243
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:38,167
She was so childlike, lost,

244
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:39,708
and in need of compassion.

245
00:11:40,792 --> 00:11:42,458
We should get in touch.

246
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:43,958
- [Carla] Billy.

247
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,375
- I don't like the way that
professor looked at her.

248
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:48,958
She's vulnerable right now.

249
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,542
He might take advantage.

250
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:52,625
- Billy, now's not the time.

251
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:53,833
Money's rolling in,

252
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,000
your engagements are
booked weeks in advance,

253
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,500
Seen and Seen Magazine is
at work on a cover story.

254
00:12:00,167 --> 00:12:03,333
- The universe took her
parents to make room for us

255
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:06,792
and you know we always must
do what the universe asks.

256
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,167
We need to find a
reason to see her

257
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:12,292
and make sure she
doesn't remember.

258
00:12:12,292 --> 00:12:13,208
- Billy, I just--

259
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,667
- She'll be quiet, Carla.

260
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:19,167
All we need to do is
remind her of her promise.

261
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,500
(phone ringing)

262
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:28,792
- Hello?

263
00:12:28,792 --> 00:12:31,833
Laurie's room, a
sleepy Sharon speaking.

264
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:32,750
- Hey, Sharon?

265
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,000
Is Laurie there?

266
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,667
- I picked up because
her machine conked out

267
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:36,500
on her the other day.

268
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,333
Sarah?

269
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,750
- Yeah.

270
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,000
Do you know where she is?

271
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,792
She told me she'd be
working all night.

272
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:43,167
- No, she went out.

273
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:46,333
And by the look of her,
she had a really hot date.

274
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,375
You wanna leave a message?

275
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,708
- No.

276
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,833
I'll call in the morning.

277
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:52,625
- Cool.

278
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,208
(phone beeps)

279
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,375
(ominous music)

280
00:13:25,292 --> 00:13:27,958
(phone ringing)

281
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:39,500
- Hello?

282
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,708
- Laur, I'm sorry it's so early

283
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,417
but you were out when
I called last night.

284
00:13:42,417 --> 00:13:43,250
- [Laurie] Out?

285
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,500
Who told you I was out?

286
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,375
I was up until four
with that damn paper.

287
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:48,875
- Whatever.

288
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,500
Did you make a decision
about Dr. Donnelly?

289
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,333
- You're not letting
this go, are you?

290
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,833
- [Sarah] Can you
be there at 10?

291
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:57,292
- Okay.

292
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,000
Bye.

293
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,083
(sighs)

294
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,667
- Sarah tells me that
you feel responsible

295
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:10,875
for your parents' accident.

296
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,167
Is that a fair statement?

297
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,667
- I broke an appointment
for a DMV inspection.

298
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:20,375
My dad took the car in for me.

299
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:24,375
He and my mom were driving
into Colbert when...

300
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,875
- Why'd you break
the appointment?

301
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,833
- The mechanic was a creep.

302
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,458
He kept leering at me.

303
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:34,333
- Do men often make
you feel uncomfortable?

304
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,583
- Some.

305
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,958
Look, two things have
gone wrong in my life

306
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:40,375
and they're both my
fault, I admit it.

307
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,000
- Two things, your
parents' deaths and?

308
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,917
- And somebody grabbed me off
the street when I was four.

309
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,250
I was away two years.

310
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,833
- Why would that be your fault?

311
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:51,792
- I was forbidden to go in the
front yard alone but I did.

312
00:14:51,792 --> 00:14:52,583
- I see.

313
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:59,167
Well, what do you remember
from the times you were away?

314
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,833
(gentle music)

315
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,333
- Nothing.

316
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06,875
- But you remember
things from before.

317
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:10,042
You must remember something.

318
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,958
Most people remember a great
deal of their formative years.

319
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:18,167
The first day of school,
(mumbles) their pets.

320
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,500
You must remember something.

321
00:15:22,792 --> 00:15:26,042
Find it a little
hard to believe.

322
00:15:26,042 --> 00:15:28,333
It's okay, you can tell me.

323
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,167
- Leave the kid alone!

324
00:15:30,167 --> 00:15:31,833
She's been through enough.

325
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:38,792
- Who are you?

326
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:42,667
- Kate.

327
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,500
- How long have you
been with Laurie?

328
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,000
- Since she was four.

329
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,000
- And what can you tell
me about the knife dream?

330
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,083
- If you make her talk about
that, the dream will come true

331
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,917
and I will not stand by
and let you kill her!

332
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,958
(dramatic music)

333
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:11,667
(cars honking)

334
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:13,208
- Have you ever noticed
any significant moments

335
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:15,083
where Laurie can't
remember where she's been

336
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,500
or what she's done?

337
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,333
- Lots, there was
one last night.

338
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,958
She said that she was
staying in to work on a paper

339
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,500
and her roommate
said she went out.

340
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,875
And this morning, she
claimed that she was home.

341
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,917
- And that happens often?

342
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:28,292
- She's very protective
about her privacy.

343
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:29,833
- More than you might imagine.

344
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,333
Your sister's
manifesting a condition

345
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:34,292
called Dissociative Identity
Disorder, DID for short.

346
00:16:34,292 --> 00:16:36,500
It means she has
multiple personalities.

347
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:38,667
- What?

348
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:39,625
- There's nothing
to be afraid of.

349
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,042
In fact, it's quite remarkable.

350
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:43,000
A child powerless against
abuse often creates

351
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,417
other personalities or alters
to help survive the trauma.

352
00:16:46,417 --> 00:16:47,625
- As a defense mechanism?

353
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,125
- Exactly.

354
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,792
The alters help the child say
this isn't happening to me,

355
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:52,625
it's happening to someone else.

356
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,708
- And this has happened
since she was abducted?

357
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,458
- More or less.

358
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:59,167
I've only met one so far
but there may be others.

359
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:00,417
They're her way of
dealing with pain

360
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:01,792
and the pain of
your parents' deaths

361
00:17:01,792 --> 00:17:03,542
most likely brought them back.

362
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:04,833
- Will she need clinical help?

363
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:05,792
- Maybe.

364
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:08,708
But right now, I need your help.

365
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:09,542
- Anything.

366
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,500
- The greatest danger
in treating DID will
be Laurie's fear

367
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,333
of losing the protective
wall she's built.

368
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:18,167
You need to watch for any signs
that she might harm herself.

369
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:19,667
- Oh my god.

370
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:21,958
- I'll be there for both
of you every step, Sarah.

371
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,458
But this has to be done,

372
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,250
otherwise Laurie
won't ever be well.

373
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:30,917
(singing in foreign language)

374
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,333
- Hi.

375
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,167
- Hello, stranger.

376
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,125
How's life in the big city?

377
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,833
- Normal.

378
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:48,417
Traffic from
Manhattan was murder.

379
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:50,625
Why can't you get
tenure at Columbia?

380
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,833
- Well, I keep hearing that
they have travel agencies

381
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,625
in New Jersey too.

382
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:57,375
- Not ones with Anne Webster's
millionaire client list.

383
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,208
- That's true.

384
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,375
How is the old broad?

385
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,167
- More maddening by the day.

386
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:09,792
But in one month, business
gets transferred to me

387
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:11,833
and you can get a
job in the city.

388
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,042
- Okay.

389
00:18:14,917 --> 00:18:15,750
- Thanks.

390
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,500
Here, you have a
letter from Leona.

391
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,667
What is it now, another
oath of her undying love

392
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:34,167
or (mumbles) remembrance
of your last tryst?

393
00:18:34,167 --> 00:18:35,875
- Pretty remembrance.

394
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,167
Oh, it's kinda juicy.

395
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,583
You should try this.

396
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:42,417
Look at that.

397
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,167
(mumbling)

398
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,208
- Pain in my heart?

399
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,875
Why aren't you taking
this seriously?

400
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,625
- Because they're
obviously just fantasies.

401
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,958
- Why haven't you been
to the dean about it?

402
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,417
- Because they're
from some student

403
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:03,000
who has some personal issues.

404
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
- That can ruin your career.

405
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,458
- And her life.

406
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,833
- What about our love song?

407
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,542
- Karen, I'm not gonna turn
some poor misguided girl

408
00:19:13,542 --> 00:19:16,958
who writes bad porn
over to administration.

409
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:19,208
They'll have her
tarred and feathered.

410
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,875
As soon as I find out
who this Leona is,

411
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,208
I'll do what I can to
get her some help, okay?

412
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:27,833
- All right, well, you know
you'll only make matters worse.

413
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,500
Sometimes I think you like
this kind of attention.

414
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,333
- What?

415
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:35,792
- I heard this campus gossip.

416
00:19:35,792 --> 00:19:39,292
Female students calling you
Sexy Allan, flirting with you.

417
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,583
- Oh, Karen.

418
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:45,500
- Sometimes I think
this secret admirer

419
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,375
is only a secret from me.

420
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,333
- Don't be ridiculous.

421
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:54,333
- No, I'm not, listen, we
can't leave it like this.

422
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,542
If you don't wanna do it for
your career, do it for us.

423
00:19:57,917 --> 00:19:59,958
I mean it, Allan, I'm not
gonna put up with this anymore.

424
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,000
- Okay, okay.

425
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:06,500
(kisses)

426
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:13,292
- That's not it.

427
00:20:13,292 --> 00:20:14,625
Why can't I get this right?

428
00:20:23,917 --> 00:20:25,875
- [Woman] Maybe you're
not smart enough.

429
00:20:29,417 --> 00:20:32,250
- [Woman] That
shrink's confusing you.

430
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,958
You shouldn't see him anymore.

431
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,333
- [Woman] You're
trying too hard, honey.

432
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:42,708
Sexy Allan already likes you.

433
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,167
You don't need to impress him.

434
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:46,500
- God!

435
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:58,708
(phone ringing)

436
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:02,500
- Hey, Mark.

437
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,000
How's my miserable
heartless senior prosecutor?

438
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,042
- Still miserable and heartless.

439
00:21:06,042 --> 00:21:08,083
So how's the Mays'
case shaping up?

440
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,250
- Slow but sure.

441
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,875
Did we set a trial date?

442
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,417
- A week from Thursday.

443
00:21:12,417 --> 00:21:13,667
- What?

444
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:14,917
- [Mark] Wanna hand
it off to Durant?

445
00:21:14,917 --> 00:21:17,250
- No, I'll be ready.

446
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,708
- Sarah, you've got
a lot on your plate.

447
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,208
- I can handle it, Mark.

448
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,667
Nobody else knows
this case like I do.

449
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:24,000
I'll convict this guy.

450
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,958
- Okay.

451
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:27,167
If you need anything, just ask.

452
00:21:35,917 --> 00:21:37,583
- Hi.
- Laurie.

453
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,458
- Have you had a chance
to read over my paper

454
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:40,833
on Emily Dickinson yet?

455
00:21:42,417 --> 00:21:44,125
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

456
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,333
- Not at all.

457
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:47,708
Professor West and I
were just finishing up.

458
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:48,958
Could you bring those back

459
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:49,750
when you finish those
assessments, Vera?

460
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,417
- Of course.

461
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:54,458
- Have a seat, have a seat.

462
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:56,167
- I'm sorry it was so late.

463
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:58,500
- Nonsense, it was
very well written.

464
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,167
Although you've
changed your mind

465
00:22:00,167 --> 00:22:01,792
about Old Em since last term.

466
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,208
- I have?

467
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:05,583
- Before, you used to
feel her genius came

468
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,083
from her being a recluse.

469
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:09,208
Now apparently you feel she
should have had an affair

470
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,000
with her mentor.

471
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:13,375
- (laughs) Her mentor?

472
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:14,750
- Charles Wadsworth.

473
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,750
- Oh, I guess I just thought

474
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,583
she should have a physical
outlet for her emotions

475
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:22,167
instead of being afraid of them.

476
00:22:22,167 --> 00:22:23,667
- Very astute.

477
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:25,375
Always amazed at
your ability to think

478
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:27,292
in several directions at once.

479
00:22:29,792 --> 00:22:32,833
Laurie, did you write
this margin note?

480
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:36,750
- Yeah, um, I can print
you up a clean copy.

481
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,667
- No, no, no, no.

482
00:22:39,417 --> 00:22:41,333
Laurie, we need to talk.

483
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:43,250
(knocking)

484
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,083
Karen.

485
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,667
- I took the afternoon off,
I wanted to surprise you.

486
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,250
Looks like I did.

487
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:55,417
- No, no, no, Laurie
Kinmount, my wife Karen.

488
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:57,000
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

489
00:22:58,667 --> 00:22:59,667
- [Allan] Laurie
and I were just--

490
00:22:59,667 --> 00:23:02,083
- No, it's all right.

491
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:03,167
I should get going.

492
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:06,708
- Thanks, Laurie.

493
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:10,875
- She the one?

494
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:14,042
- Karen.

495
00:23:14,042 --> 00:23:16,083
- You weren't home when
I called you last night.

496
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:17,792
You weren't home when I
called you this morning.

497
00:23:17,792 --> 00:23:22,208
- I had a faculty dinner
and a early class.

498
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:24,167
Do you need to
check my calendar?

499
00:23:24,167 --> 00:23:25,667
- No.

500
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:28,000
Look, I want to know what's
going on between you and Leona.

501
00:23:30,417 --> 00:23:32,792
- Can we talk about this later?

502
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:35,875
- Okay.

503
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:36,708
- Karen.

504
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:45,167
- I just love this staircase.

505
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:49,375
And here we are, back
where we started.

506
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:53,500
Is there anything else that
you'd like to look at again?

507
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,667
- All of it.

508
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:56,583
No, no, it's perfect.

509
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:59,708
I have a million ideas
about redecorating.

510
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:02,500
- And isn't that just
how you always know

511
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,042
that something's perfect?

512
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:04,875
(phone ringing)

513
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,000
Oh, shoot.

514
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:08,042
I have to take this.

515
00:24:08,042 --> 00:24:09,625
Would you just excuse
me for a minute?

516
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:10,958
Thanks.

517
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:11,917
Betsy Lincoln.

518
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:14,583
(phone ringing)

519
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:20,333
- [Justin] Sarah,
it's Justin Donnelly.

520
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:23,750
I have to shift Laurie's
next appointment (mumbles).

521
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,667
Could you have her call me?

522
00:24:24,667 --> 00:24:25,500
Thanks.

523
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:32,583
- So are we thinking
of making an offer?

524
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:34,583
I'm sure that I
could persuade Sarah

525
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:36,833
to consider lowering the price.

526
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:38,583
- Oh, we're not
haggling over the cost.

527
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:39,833
- We're not?

528
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:42,042
- Mm-mm, the girls have
been through the mill.

529
00:24:42,042 --> 00:24:44,250
Billy is willing to pay
them what they want.

530
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,917
- (laughs) Well, what part
of heaven did you fall from?

531
00:24:48,917 --> 00:24:50,333
Let's go back to the office.

532
00:24:57,833 --> 00:25:00,208
(dog barking)

533
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:01,500
- Don't know what to say to her.

534
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:04,667
- You'll have to let
the dean see this.

535
00:25:04,667 --> 00:25:07,458
- Karen, even if he believes
I haven't encouraged this,

536
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:09,833
it'll change the way
the faculty looks at me.

537
00:25:09,833 --> 00:25:12,250
Either way, it'll be
devastating to her.

538
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,250
- [Karen] That's
not your problem.

539
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,333
- Yes, it is.

540
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:15,167
- [Karen] Why?

541
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:16,125
- She's very sensitive.

542
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:17,542
She just lost her parents

543
00:25:17,542 --> 00:25:19,333
and I promised her sister
I'd look after her.

544
00:25:20,917 --> 00:25:22,500
- What about me, what about us?

545
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:27,292
(ominous music)

546
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:54,583
(phone ringing)

547
00:25:57,125 --> 00:25:57,958
- Hello?

548
00:25:57,958 --> 00:25:59,250
- Laurie, it's me.

549
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,208
I got a call today
from Gregg Bennett.

550
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:03,667
He called to offer
you his condolences.

551
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:05,042
He wants to see you.

552
00:26:05,042 --> 00:26:06,000
- Well, I don't want to see him.

553
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,167
Don't give him my number.

554
00:26:07,167 --> 00:26:08,083
- He just wants--

555
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:09,208
- No.

556
00:26:09,208 --> 00:26:10,458
Look, don't let him fool you.

557
00:26:10,458 --> 00:26:12,875
He's not the nice guy
everybody thinks he is.

558
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:15,083
- Okay, I'm sorry.

559
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:17,000
I didn't mean to upset you.

560
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,500
Oh, I know this is odd,

561
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,750
but you know where the carving
knife in Mom's kitchen went?

562
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,708
- No, you know I never
go near those things.

563
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:23,875
I hate knives.

564
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:25,500
- Okay.

565
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,667
It's just weird.

566
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:28,042
I can't find it anywhere.

567
00:26:28,042 --> 00:26:29,958
- Look, I've got more
important things to think about

568
00:26:29,958 --> 00:26:32,000
than some stupid knife, okay?

569
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,208
- Are you okay?

570
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:36,000
- I'm just busy.

571
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,792
Anything else?

572
00:26:37,792 --> 00:26:38,917
- Yeah, actually there is.

573
00:26:38,917 --> 00:26:40,458
Dr. Donnelly needs you to call,

574
00:26:40,458 --> 00:26:41,833
we're shifting an appointment.

575
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,917
- Sarah, do I have
to keep seeing him?

576
00:26:45,917 --> 00:26:47,625
Why can't you all
just leave me alone?

577
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:50,500
- Laurie, he's helping
you, I know he is.

578
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,667
Please stick with it?

579
00:26:52,667 --> 00:26:54,000
For me.

580
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,833
- All right.

581
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,292
Look, sorry to blow up
about that stupid knife.

582
00:26:58,292 --> 00:26:59,792
I'm just tired, okay?

583
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:02,208
- Okay.

584
00:27:02,208 --> 00:27:03,375
Sleep tight.

585
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:04,208
- Yeah.

586
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:10,375
(sighs)

587
00:27:11,958 --> 00:27:14,667
- Billy, are you sure
this is a good idea?

588
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:17,417
I don't want people to
suspect I took that knife.

589
00:27:17,417 --> 00:27:19,125
- That's the least
of our problems.

590
00:27:20,542 --> 00:27:23,583
Leigh may have given herself
to another man, Opal.

591
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:27,083
- Billy, you're not Bic
anymore and I'm not Opal

592
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:28,958
and Laurie is not Leigh.

593
00:27:28,958 --> 00:27:30,333
Put her out of your mind.

594
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:32,958
Seen and Seen
Magazine called today.

595
00:27:32,958 --> 00:27:35,500
Hiding the scams we
pulled before this one

596
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,708
will be hard enough.

597
00:27:36,708 --> 00:27:38,375
We don't need any more problems.

598
00:27:39,542 --> 00:27:42,292
- [Billy] We don't
have problems, Opal.

599
00:27:42,292 --> 00:27:46,000
All we have now
are opportunities.

600
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,417
- Did you get a chance to
read the data I gave you

601
00:27:54,417 --> 00:27:55,708
on dissociative disorders?

602
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:56,917
- Mm-hmm.

603
00:27:56,917 --> 00:27:58,167
- Anything you
didn't understand?

604
00:27:58,167 --> 00:28:01,292
- Uh, no, but it's
kind of creepy.

605
00:28:01,292 --> 00:28:02,542
- Oh, don't think
of it that way.

606
00:28:02,542 --> 00:28:03,500
We've all gone for a
drive, drifted off,

607
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,500
missed some of the journey.

608
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,792
That's all
dissociation really is.

609
00:28:06,792 --> 00:28:08,958
- Only I have people
fill in for me.

610
00:28:08,958 --> 00:28:09,792
- Exactly.

611
00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:11,667
Why don't we talk about
some of the things

612
00:28:11,667 --> 00:28:13,250
that came up last time?

613
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:15,750
Do you know anyone named Kate?

614
00:28:17,167 --> 00:28:19,375
- Katherine's my middle name.

615
00:28:19,375 --> 00:28:21,333
When I was a little kid and
I wanted to be grown up,

616
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:22,583
I called myself Kate.

617
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,167
- And what else stands
out from your childhood?

618
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:29,542
- Um, I loved to read.

619
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:31,750
Summer at the beach.

620
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,333
Cheerleading in high school.

621
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,208
- [Justin] Did you
have a boyfriend?

622
00:28:36,208 --> 00:28:37,417
- Nobody serious.

623
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:41,125
(laughs) Well, one.

624
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:42,167
Gregg Bennett.

625
00:28:42,167 --> 00:28:43,000
- When was this?

626
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,208
- Last year.

627
00:28:44,208 --> 00:28:46,167
We're not together anymore.

628
00:28:46,167 --> 00:28:47,500
He was too demanding.

629
00:28:48,833 --> 00:28:50,333
Look, I don't want to
talk about him, okay?

630
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:51,500
It was unpleasant.

631
00:28:53,167 --> 00:28:54,625
- Would unpleasant
be a word you'd use

632
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:56,000
to describe the knife dream?

633
00:28:57,625 --> 00:29:00,333
- I should've known
we'd get back to that.

634
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:02,542
Did Sarah call you
about the missing knife?

635
00:29:02,542 --> 00:29:03,750
- No.

636
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,792
Is there a reason
you relate your dream

637
00:29:04,792 --> 00:29:06,167
to this missing knife?

638
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,625
- Well, they're
both carving knives.

639
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:12,458
Sarah probably thinks I'm
planning to kill myself.

640
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:14,250
- Why would she think that?

641
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,208
- I don't know, she's
always watching me,

642
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:18,792
trying to see if I'm about
to flip out or something.

643
00:29:18,792 --> 00:29:19,625
- Why would she think that?

644
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:20,625
- How do I know?

645
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:22,542
Look.

646
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:26,792
Why do I have to answer
all of these questions?

647
00:29:26,792 --> 00:29:28,083
- Because we're
trying to find out

648
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:30,042
why you have these nightmares.

649
00:29:30,042 --> 00:29:31,833
- [Laurie] I told you
everything I know.

650
00:29:31,833 --> 00:29:33,083
- I don't think you have.

651
00:29:35,333 --> 00:29:37,375
- You're doing it
again, aren't you?

652
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,167
- Kate, thank you for
looking after Laurie,

653
00:29:39,167 --> 00:29:40,500
but I'm not gonna harm her.

654
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,625
- Oh, aren't you sweet?

655
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,833
- Laurie?

656
00:29:56,375 --> 00:29:57,917
You okay?

657
00:29:57,917 --> 00:29:59,833
- I've got a headache.

658
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:01,458
- Okay.

659
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:03,000
Well, that's all for today.

660
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,375
We don't need to do any more.

661
00:30:18,875 --> 00:30:21,208
(screaming)

662
00:30:33,292 --> 00:30:35,667
- He's wearing me out!

663
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,417
Sometimes I think he's
making me lose my mind.

664
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:42,375
(phone ringing)

665
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:49,208
(screams)

666
00:30:54,375 --> 00:30:55,333
- Hello?

667
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:56,500
- Sarah, it's me.

668
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,875
How is she?

669
00:30:57,875 --> 00:30:58,708
- Pretty upset.

670
00:30:58,708 --> 00:31:00,333
What happened?

671
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:02,167
How can a severed chicken
head end up in your office?

672
00:31:02,167 --> 00:31:03,667
- I'm not certain.

673
00:31:03,667 --> 00:31:06,375
I have a difficult patient
who's part of a cult.

674
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:07,875
This is the sort
of thing he'd do.

675
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:09,875
- Well, I hope you convince
Laurie it won't happen again.

676
00:31:09,875 --> 00:31:12,083
She's insisting
she's not going back.

677
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:13,625
- I understand.

678
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:16,667
But the fear she's describing
means we're getting somewhere.

679
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:17,875
Now we just have to find out

680
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:20,167
why this event had
so much meaning.

681
00:31:20,167 --> 00:31:21,417
- I hate to push her.

682
00:31:21,417 --> 00:31:22,583
- Look, I know how
hard this is for you

683
00:31:22,583 --> 00:31:24,542
but she's not gonna
get any better

684
00:31:24,542 --> 00:31:26,292
unless she deals with
her problems herself.

685
00:31:26,292 --> 00:31:27,917
- Well, what am
I supposed to do?

686
00:31:27,917 --> 00:31:29,000
- Just be supportive.

687
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,958
That's what you've been doing.

688
00:31:29,958 --> 00:31:31,500
That's what she needs right now.

689
00:31:34,667 --> 00:31:37,167
(Sarah sighs)

690
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:42,958
(ominous music)

691
00:31:42,958 --> 00:31:44,333
- Hi.

692
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:45,875
- Hi.

693
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:47,417
My name's Gregg Bennett, I'm
looking for Laurie Kinmount.

694
00:31:47,417 --> 00:31:49,458
- I'm sorry, she got
called in for a meeting

695
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:51,667
with Professor Grant.

696
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:54,000
- I'll come back later, thanks.

697
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,792
- Anytime.

698
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:01,000
(knocking)

699
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,042
- Professor Grant?

700
00:32:02,042 --> 00:32:02,875
- [Allan] Laurie.

701
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:04,958
Thank you for coming.

702
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:06,250
Please have a seat.

703
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,583
- I hope nothing's wrong.

704
00:32:07,583 --> 00:32:09,208
- No, please leave
the door open.

705
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:17,083
Thank you.

706
00:32:24,792 --> 00:32:27,125
Laurie, it's not uncommon

707
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:31,583
for a student to develop an
attraction to a faculty member,

708
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:35,500
especially if she's in need
of compassion, kindness.

709
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,458
And it's not unusual

710
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:40,500
that that relationship
can be misinterpreted.

711
00:32:41,792 --> 00:32:43,208
- What are you talking about?

712
00:32:50,292 --> 00:32:53,292
- Laurie, I understand
the need for fantasy.

713
00:32:53,292 --> 00:32:55,792
I couldn't teach
literature if I didn't.

714
00:32:55,792 --> 00:32:57,417
And I also understand

715
00:32:57,417 --> 00:33:00,625
how a fantasy can
become real to someone--

716
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:02,167
- You think I wrote these?

717
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:12,875
- They're in your handwriting.

718
00:33:15,292 --> 00:33:18,250
Laurie, I know you've
just lost your parents

719
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:19,458
and you've been lonely--

720
00:33:19,458 --> 00:33:21,875
- I did not write these papers.

721
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:25,125
They're sick and disgusting,
I'd never write this!

722
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:27,083
- Laurie, I had no intention
of making these public.

723
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:28,292
That's why I wanted to--

724
00:33:28,292 --> 00:33:29,875
- Wanted what?

725
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:31,500
To humiliate me?

726
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,833
Maybe you're the sick one.

727
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:34,500
Get the pretty girl
alone in your office

728
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,042
and see if she gets hot
reading filth like this?

729
00:33:37,042 --> 00:33:38,125
- Please keep your voice down.

730
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:38,958
- Why?

731
00:33:38,958 --> 00:33:40,167
Do you like it better

732
00:33:40,167 --> 00:33:41,417
when people whisper
this kind of garbage?

733
00:33:41,417 --> 00:33:42,542
Is that what turns you on?

734
00:33:42,542 --> 00:33:44,042
You sick!

735
00:33:44,042 --> 00:33:45,458
- That's it, stop right there.

736
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:47,833
- How could you
think for one minute

737
00:33:47,833 --> 00:33:50,042
that I would find
you attractive,

738
00:33:50,042 --> 00:33:52,667
that I would want
to sleep with you?

739
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:54,833
(screams)

740
00:33:57,167 --> 00:33:59,750
You're pigs, every one of you!

741
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:02,333
You've only got one
thing on your mind!

742
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:04,208
- Hell is wrong with you?

743
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,542
That's it, I'm dropping
you from my classes

744
00:34:06,542 --> 00:34:07,583
until you get some help.

745
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:08,833
- You do what you like.

746
00:34:08,833 --> 00:34:11,792
I never want to see you
again, you disgusting!

747
00:34:13,542 --> 00:34:15,458
You'll regret this.

748
00:34:15,458 --> 00:34:19,500
As God is my witness,
you'll regret this.

749
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,333
- [Allan] Laurie!

750
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,292
- All right, let's
move along here.

751
00:34:28,292 --> 00:34:29,667
There's nothing more to see.

752
00:34:38,375 --> 00:34:41,000
(upbeat music)

753
00:34:51,917 --> 00:34:53,958
- He is so sweet.

754
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:54,833
- Professor Grant?

755
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:58,667
- Nobody nicknamed him
Sexy Allan, he earned it.

756
00:34:58,667 --> 00:35:00,208
I can tell.

757
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:02,000
- [Woman] Did you hear about
him and Laurie Kinmount?

758
00:35:02,958 --> 00:35:03,875
- No.

759
00:35:03,875 --> 00:35:05,542
- They had a big lovers' quarrel

760
00:35:05,542 --> 00:35:07,167
over in the English department.

761
00:35:07,167 --> 00:35:08,458
- No way.

762
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:11,333
- It's true, she wrote a
bunch of steamy letters.

763
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:13,583
I'll bet he had to make
a preemptive strike

764
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:16,000
to make sure his wife
didn't get upset.

765
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,875
- Well, if he wants
to give me a try,

766
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:22,125
I will certainly, certainly
give his wife something

767
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:23,875
to be upset about.

768
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:26,167
(clatters)

769
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:31,208
- I was trying to handle it
as discreetly as I could.

770
00:35:31,208 --> 00:35:32,667
- No, it's not
your fault, Allan.

771
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:34,750
I should have told you
what she was dealing with.

772
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:37,375
I guess I was trying
to be discreet too.

773
00:35:37,375 --> 00:35:40,000
Could you send those
letters to Dr. Donnelly?

774
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
- I'll mail them in the morning.

775
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,125
Does he know about
this Leona character?

776
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:47,708
- I'm not sure but anything
you could send him would help.

777
00:35:47,708 --> 00:35:49,333
- Never seen her so angry.

778
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,958
When you see her,

779
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:53,708
can you tell her I didn't
mean to embarrass her?

780
00:35:53,708 --> 00:35:56,917
- Oh, don't worry, I'm
sure she'll understand.

781
00:35:56,917 --> 00:35:58,083
Anything else?

782
00:35:58,083 --> 00:35:59,583
- No.

783
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:02,125
Now I have to call my wife
and tell her she was right.

784
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:03,375
This isn't my day, is it?

785
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:05,583
- Good luck.

786
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:06,417
- Thanks.

787
00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:19,333
(phone ringing)

788
00:36:22,167 --> 00:36:23,625
- Hey!
- Where is she?

789
00:36:23,625 --> 00:36:26,208
- Whoa, I don't think she
feels like speaking to anybody.

790
00:36:26,208 --> 00:36:27,333
- Well, I'm not anybody!

791
00:36:27,333 --> 00:36:28,667
Laurie!

792
00:36:28,667 --> 00:36:30,167
Laurie?

793
00:36:30,167 --> 00:36:32,000
- Gregg, get out of here.

794
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I told you I never
want to see you again.

795
00:36:35,625 --> 00:36:37,292
- Why, because of
your other boyfriend?

796
00:36:37,292 --> 00:36:40,208
- You are not my boyfriend.

797
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:41,667
- Then what's going
on with the professor?

798
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:42,500
- Nothing!

799
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,167
No, stop it.

800
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:45,583
Get out of my room.

801
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:47,208
- No, this has gone
on long enough.

802
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:49,333
You're gonna tell
me what's going on.

803
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:50,833
And if he touched you, I swear--

804
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,875
- Get out of my room!

805
00:36:52,875 --> 00:36:54,333
Get out of my life!

806
00:36:54,333 --> 00:36:55,750
Get out, get out!

807
00:36:56,917 --> 00:36:58,375
- You better leave or
I'm calling the police.

808
00:36:58,375 --> 00:36:59,208
- Get out.

809
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:02,458
Get out.

810
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:08,500
(screams)

811
00:37:14,167 --> 00:37:16,833
(ominous music)

812
00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:25,417
(knife clatters)

813
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,000
- There you are.

814
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,833
Ha.

815
00:37:40,833 --> 00:37:42,208
We should get going.

816
00:37:42,208 --> 00:37:44,875
Mrs. Germaine's
flight arrives soon.

817
00:37:44,875 --> 00:37:46,042
- Doesn't take more
than 40 minutes

818
00:37:46,042 --> 00:37:47,583
to go to Kennedy at this hour.

819
00:37:47,583 --> 00:37:50,292
- Well, we may need to
arrange a wheelchair.

820
00:37:50,292 --> 00:37:51,500
She's not well, you know.

821
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,792
- [Karen] And I thought of it.

822
00:37:52,792 --> 00:37:54,375
- Well, I don't see the booking.

823
00:37:56,667 --> 00:37:57,500
- Here it is.

824
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:00,833
Right there.

825
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:01,792
- Oh.

826
00:38:01,792 --> 00:38:02,583
Well, what about a red cab?

827
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:03,833
You know how she shops.

828
00:38:03,833 --> 00:38:04,875
(phone ringing)

829
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:06,667
- Anne Webster Travel.

830
00:38:06,667 --> 00:38:08,833
- [Allan] Karen, it's me.

831
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:10,333
- Hi.

832
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:12,000
You settle the letter business?

833
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,750
- Not really.

834
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,167
- Now are you gonna
go to the dean?

835
00:38:16,042 --> 00:38:17,500
- Karen, we need to talk.

836
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,500
- You need to go
to the dean, Allan.

837
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,417
- [Allan] We need to talk.

838
00:38:21,417 --> 00:38:22,667
- I can't right now.

839
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:23,833
Anne and I have
to go to Kennedy,

840
00:38:23,833 --> 00:38:25,542
we have to pick somebody
up, I can't do it.

841
00:38:25,542 --> 00:38:27,000
- Please, this is important.

842
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,458
- So is my job.

843
00:38:28,458 --> 00:38:29,958
You know, just because you're
ready to deal with things,

844
00:38:29,958 --> 00:38:32,333
it doesn't mean I can
drop everything here.

845
00:38:32,333 --> 00:38:33,583
- Call me later?

846
00:38:33,583 --> 00:38:35,667
- [Karen] I'll call
you from the airport.

847
00:38:46,833 --> 00:38:49,500
(ominous music)

848
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:39,917
(screaming)

849
00:39:45,375 --> 00:39:49,792
- [Woman] Miss Kinmount,
your sister's on line three.

850
00:39:52,542 --> 00:39:53,375
- Laurie?

851
00:39:53,375 --> 00:39:54,708
- Sarah.

852
00:39:54,708 --> 00:39:57,500
Sarah, Professor
Grant's been murdered

853
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,375
and the police think I did it.

854
00:39:59,375 --> 00:40:00,208
- What?

855
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:01,458
Where are you?

856
00:40:01,458 --> 00:40:03,375
- I'm at the state
police station.

857
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:05,375
Sarah, please come and get me.

858
00:40:06,667 --> 00:40:07,917
- Sarah.

859
00:40:07,917 --> 00:40:10,125
- Don't say anything
until I get there.

860
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:11,667
- I just got a call
from the state police.

861
00:40:11,667 --> 00:40:12,625
They've arrested Laurie.

862
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:13,625
- I know.

863
00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:15,125
I'm on my way.

864
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:17,208
- The only one they'll allow
her to see is her lawyer.

865
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:19,250
- Well, then I guess
that makes me her lawyer.

866
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,167
- You can't.

867
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:21,167
You're a county prosecutor.

868
00:40:21,167 --> 00:40:23,167
- Not anymore, I'm on leave.

869
00:40:27,042 --> 00:40:29,708
(phone ringing)

870
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,750
- Anne Webster Travel.

871
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:40,042
No, she's away from
her desk at the moment.

872
00:40:40,042 --> 00:40:40,833
May I help?

873
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,833
Oh my god.

874
00:40:47,542 --> 00:40:49,792
Yes, I'll get her right away.

875
00:40:54,292 --> 00:40:55,083
- What's wrong?

876
00:40:56,708 --> 00:40:59,458
(crowd mumbling)

877
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,000
- It's just a formality.

878
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,292
- The judge said $150,000.

879
00:41:05,292 --> 00:41:06,667
We don't have that
kind of money.

880
00:41:06,667 --> 00:41:07,583
- Don't worry about it.

881
00:41:07,583 --> 00:41:09,042
I'll get you out in a few hours.

882
00:41:17,833 --> 00:41:20,500
(ominous music)

883
00:41:28,167 --> 00:41:30,667
- [Woman] I loved him, I
didn't want him to die!

884
00:41:30,667 --> 00:41:31,667
I loved him!

885
00:41:32,833 --> 00:41:36,000
- [Woman] I told
you to stay home.

886
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,333
Look what you've done to her!

887
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:41,250
- [Woman] Karen didn't
want Allan, he wanted me.

888
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:43,583
I wish she was dead instead.

889
00:41:45,083 --> 00:41:46,750
- Miss Kinmount, bail's posted.

890
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:48,042
Your sister's waiting.

891
00:41:55,625 --> 00:41:59,125
- Oh, it'll be okay,
Laur, it'll be okay.

892
00:42:07,167 --> 00:42:08,125
- Where's Laurie?

893
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:10,125
- Upstairs, she's resting.

894
00:42:10,125 --> 00:42:12,667
Dr. Justin Donnelly,
this is Brendan Moody.

895
00:42:12,667 --> 00:42:14,333
I don't know if the two
of you have crossed paths

896
00:42:14,333 --> 00:42:16,000
at the prosecutor's office.

897
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,250
- Never had the pleasure.

898
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:19,167
Heard a lot about
you though, Doc.

899
00:42:19,167 --> 00:42:21,125
- Brendan's in our
investigations office.

900
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:22,333
He's gonna help us.

901
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:24,667
- Well, I've never
seen Sarah lose,

902
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:27,333
so I didn't want to
be on the wrong side.

903
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:28,583
- Well, that's great

904
00:42:28,583 --> 00:42:29,833
because we're gonna need
all the help we can get.

905
00:42:29,833 --> 00:42:31,458
Have you read the
police reports?

906
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:32,708
- I watched them type it up.

907
00:42:32,708 --> 00:42:34,417
Sure doesn't look good.

908
00:42:34,417 --> 00:42:35,667
Laurie's threatened the victim,

909
00:42:35,667 --> 00:42:37,125
time of death was
around midnight,

910
00:42:37,125 --> 00:42:39,083
nobody can account for her
whereabouts during that time.

911
00:42:39,083 --> 00:42:41,458
Knife's the one gone
missing from the kitchen.

912
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:42,875
Allan's blood was on it

913
00:42:42,875 --> 00:42:45,125
and it was on her clothing
and on her bracelet.

914
00:42:45,125 --> 00:42:47,500
- Now I don't remember Laurie
owning a bracelet like that.

915
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,083
- Well, she probably
won't recognize it either.

916
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:51,375
Neither it nor the
dress she was wearing

917
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:52,625
match her belongings.

918
00:42:52,625 --> 00:42:54,833
It was probably
purchased by Leona.

919
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:57,208
- Her other personalities
have that much control?

920
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:59,167
- Laurie's only hope
may be convincing a jury

921
00:42:59,167 --> 00:43:01,333
that an alter
committed the crime.

922
00:43:01,333 --> 00:43:03,083
- And that's a
dangerous argument.

923
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:04,458
Even if she's found innocent,

924
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:06,500
she still might end
up in an institution.

925
00:43:07,917 --> 00:43:10,583
- Then we're gonna have to
dig up some other evidence.

926
00:43:10,583 --> 00:43:13,625
The papers are full of that
fatal attraction angle,

927
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:16,042
painting Laurie as
the jilted lover.

928
00:43:16,042 --> 00:43:18,667
But they're ignoring our
professor's situation.

929
00:43:18,667 --> 00:43:20,208
- Which is?

930
00:43:20,208 --> 00:43:22,542
- His wife was never home
and I'll wager Sexy Allan

931
00:43:22,542 --> 00:43:24,333
came by his moniker
fair and square.

932
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:25,333
Laurie may not have
been the only one

933
00:43:25,333 --> 00:43:27,000
who was involved
with this Romeo.

934
00:43:28,125 --> 00:43:30,125
Wanna spend a couple
days around the college.

935
00:43:30,125 --> 00:43:32,042
They're burying Allan tomorrow.

936
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:33,500
I'll be there.

937
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,667
In my experience, the
killer usually drops by

938
00:43:36,667 --> 00:43:38,917
to make sure the
victim is really dead.

939
00:43:40,125 --> 00:43:41,083
I'll see you later.

940
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:43,833
- Thanks.

941
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:52,167
Laurie?

942
00:43:53,583 --> 00:43:55,083
- [Laurie] Come in.

943
00:43:55,083 --> 00:43:55,917
Don't.

944
00:43:59,417 --> 00:44:00,375
- Are you sleeping?

945
00:44:01,458 --> 00:44:03,500
- I was just thinking
about things.

946
00:44:05,167 --> 00:44:07,000
I always like this time of day.

947
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,375
It's always quiet, not
filled with all those things

948
00:44:11,375 --> 00:44:13,000
you think about in the daylight.

949
00:44:14,917 --> 00:44:16,375
- What were you thinking?

950
00:44:16,375 --> 00:44:17,208
- Allan.

951
00:44:18,667 --> 00:44:22,333
How he came to Mom and Dad's
funeral but I can't go to his.

952
00:44:23,375 --> 00:44:25,167
I feel so sorry for him.

953
00:44:25,167 --> 00:44:27,958
He was really good to me.

954
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:31,083
I can't believe I did this.

955
00:44:34,625 --> 00:44:35,875
- It wasn't you, Laur.

956
00:44:35,875 --> 00:44:37,333
- It was some part of me.

957
00:44:38,292 --> 00:44:39,542
Dr. Donnelly says

958
00:44:39,542 --> 00:44:41,625
that I'm not supposed
to be afraid of them,

959
00:44:41,625 --> 00:44:43,583
that they're just
other versions of me,

960
00:44:43,583 --> 00:44:48,000
but I don't know how I
could be so evil and angry

961
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,042
and not know it.

962
00:44:50,167 --> 00:44:52,875
He was so kind, Sarah.

963
00:44:52,875 --> 00:44:56,292
He made me feel really
smart and special.

964
00:44:58,333 --> 00:44:59,792
I didn't mean to hurt him.

965
00:45:02,667 --> 00:45:03,500
I didn't.

966
00:45:06,167 --> 00:45:08,292
(kisses)

967
00:45:19,125 --> 00:45:20,792
- Which one's the widow?

968
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:38,083
What does a college
professor make these days?

969
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:46,292
- Hour's half gone, Laurie.

970
00:45:46,292 --> 00:45:47,292
You've hardly said a word yet.

971
00:45:47,292 --> 00:45:48,750
Anything you want to tell me?

972
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:53,917
Okay.

973
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:58,000
There's something else I'd
like to try if you're willing.

974
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,458
Hypnosis.

975
00:45:59,458 --> 00:46:00,958
You see, right now the
alters decide who will visit

976
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:03,417
and when and I'd like
that to be my call.

977
00:46:03,417 --> 00:46:05,875
And having you hypnotized
would let us go deeper.

978
00:46:07,292 --> 00:46:08,667
You willing to give it a try?

979
00:46:09,542 --> 00:46:11,667
- Is it gonna feel weird?

980
00:46:11,667 --> 00:46:13,458
- All you have to
do is fall asleep.

981
00:46:21,167 --> 00:46:23,583
(slow music)

982
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:33,833
Okay.

983
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:38,125
Just relax, Laurie.

984
00:46:38,125 --> 00:46:39,833
Do you feel comfortable?

985
00:46:39,833 --> 00:46:40,667
- I guess.

986
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:45,333
- I haven't met you yet, have I?

987
00:46:46,583 --> 00:46:47,417
- No.

988
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,917
- You wanna tell me your name?

989
00:46:54,958 --> 00:46:55,792
- Debbie.

990
00:46:57,333 --> 00:46:58,167
I'm four.

991
00:47:00,833 --> 00:47:02,583
- How are you feeling
today, Debbie?

992
00:47:04,292 --> 00:47:05,292
- Sad.

993
00:47:07,042 --> 00:47:09,333
I'm always sad.

994
00:47:09,333 --> 00:47:10,500
- You're always sad?

995
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:11,333
Why?

996
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:16,167
- 'Cause I'm always
doing bad things.

997
00:47:17,375 --> 00:47:19,500
- What sort of bad
things do you do?

998
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,792
- Not supposed to tell.

999
00:47:22,375 --> 00:47:24,625
- You talk to your
friends about it?

1000
00:47:24,625 --> 00:47:28,250
- I only have one friend
and she can't talk.

1001
00:47:30,208 --> 00:47:31,042
- She can't talk?

1002
00:47:31,042 --> 00:47:31,875
Why can't she talk?

1003
00:47:34,667 --> 00:47:36,167
- She's a chicken.

1004
00:47:36,167 --> 00:47:37,708
- [Justin] She's a chicken?

1005
00:47:37,708 --> 00:47:40,375
(Laurie laughs)

1006
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,958
- Yeah.

1007
00:47:42,958 --> 00:47:45,958
- Well, tell me about
your yard and your house.

1008
00:47:45,958 --> 00:47:46,875
- It's a farmhouse.

1009
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:51,583
- Well, who lives
there with you?

1010
00:47:52,542 --> 00:47:54,167
- I can't tell.

1011
00:47:54,167 --> 00:47:55,417
- Yes, you can.

1012
00:47:55,417 --> 00:47:56,333
You trust me?

1013
00:47:58,167 --> 00:47:59,417
Look at me, you trust me?

1014
00:48:01,042 --> 00:48:02,667
Then you can tell me.

1015
00:48:02,667 --> 00:48:04,542
Who lives in the house with you?

1016
00:48:04,542 --> 00:48:05,625
- Can't tell.

1017
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,958
(screaming)

1018
00:48:08,958 --> 00:48:10,333
- Debbie, what is
it, what do you see?

1019
00:48:10,333 --> 00:48:11,333
- The knife.

1020
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,292
- [Justin] What is
the knife doing?

1021
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:18,125
- Doesn't like me
having a friend.

1022
00:48:19,292 --> 00:48:21,125
- Is someone holding
the knife, Debbie?

1023
00:48:21,125 --> 00:48:22,333
- I can't tell.

1024
00:48:24,625 --> 00:48:25,458
No, no!

1025
00:48:27,542 --> 00:48:30,083
He killed my chicken.

1026
00:48:30,083 --> 00:48:31,750
He killed my friend.

1027
00:48:32,625 --> 00:48:34,667
(crying)

1028
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,125
- Mrs. Grant?

1029
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,875
My name is Brendan Moody.

1030
00:48:45,875 --> 00:48:48,167
I just wanted to offer
my condolences to you.

1031
00:48:48,167 --> 00:48:49,708
I'm working your husband's case

1032
00:48:49,708 --> 00:48:52,167
and I know that this is
not the time or place

1033
00:48:52,167 --> 00:48:54,875
but I'd like to talk to
you about what happened.

1034
00:48:54,875 --> 00:48:56,375
- I told the police
everything I know.

1035
00:48:56,375 --> 00:48:59,125
- Yeah, I know, I
read the reports.

1036
00:48:59,125 --> 00:49:02,500
I'm investigating on
behalf of the defendant.

1037
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,500
I know, I know,
this is difficult.

1038
00:49:06,125 --> 00:49:09,083
- She took my husband's life,
Mr. Moody, I don't think--

1039
00:49:09,083 --> 00:49:10,875
- Yeah, I know, she just
doesn't remember a thing

1040
00:49:10,875 --> 00:49:12,542
about what happened.

1041
00:49:12,542 --> 00:49:13,792
I mean, she's sick

1042
00:49:13,792 --> 00:49:15,750
and I'm trying to help
a jury understand that.

1043
00:49:16,667 --> 00:49:18,333
- So she can get off scot-free?

1044
00:49:18,333 --> 00:49:19,250
Is that it?

1045
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:20,458
- So we can prevent this tragedy

1046
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:22,667
from hurting more people
than it already has.

1047
00:49:23,958 --> 00:49:25,458
A lot of people said
a lot of nice things

1048
00:49:25,458 --> 00:49:27,083
about your husband
this afternoon

1049
00:49:28,292 --> 00:49:30,417
and I know that he was
trying to help Laurie.

1050
00:49:31,667 --> 00:49:32,750
And...

1051
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:34,167
- Out of respect for his memory,

1052
00:49:34,167 --> 00:49:35,500
you want me to do the same.

1053
00:49:37,667 --> 00:49:38,500
- Yeah.

1054
00:49:40,417 --> 00:49:41,625
- You can come to the house.

1055
00:49:41,625 --> 00:49:42,458
- Thank you.

1056
00:49:46,667 --> 00:49:47,583
- [Justin] You
sure you feel okay?

1057
00:49:47,583 --> 00:49:49,375
- Yeah, I feel a little weak.

1058
00:49:52,833 --> 00:49:53,667
What's this?

1059
00:49:53,667 --> 00:49:55,167
- That's a journal.

1060
00:49:55,167 --> 00:49:56,375
I want you to start
writing down your thoughts,

1061
00:49:56,375 --> 00:49:58,833
no matter how trivial
they might seem.

1062
00:49:58,833 --> 00:50:00,167
- And what about the others?

1063
00:50:00,167 --> 00:50:01,333
- Well, if they've
got something to say,

1064
00:50:01,333 --> 00:50:02,833
they'll make entries too.

1065
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,125
Just relax, see what ideas
or memories come to you.

1066
00:50:05,125 --> 00:50:07,542
There's no right or wrong to
this and I think it'll help.

1067
00:50:07,542 --> 00:50:08,375
Okay?

1068
00:50:09,417 --> 00:50:10,250
- Okay.

1069
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:11,292
- I'll see you tomorrow.

1070
00:50:12,375 --> 00:50:13,208
- Bye.

1071
00:50:17,125 --> 00:50:19,792
(ominous music)

1072
00:50:25,625 --> 00:50:27,542
- Billy, aren't you
supposed to be looking

1073
00:50:27,542 --> 00:50:29,333
at pictures of us
from our early days

1074
00:50:29,333 --> 00:50:31,167
for Seen and Seen Magazine?

1075
00:50:31,167 --> 00:50:32,958
- She was such a lovely child.

1076
00:50:35,083 --> 00:50:37,500
- Billy, they should have
been burned like the others.

1077
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,667
- No, no, no,
these are precious.

1078
00:50:41,167 --> 00:50:43,500
This one was taken when she
made the cheerleader squad.

1079
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:47,167
And here is the
graduation photo.

1080
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:49,125
- They need to be burned.

1081
00:50:49,125 --> 00:50:51,917
That doctor's digging
around in her head.

1082
00:50:51,917 --> 00:50:53,750
No one should find them.

1083
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:54,667
- You worry too much.

1084
00:50:54,667 --> 00:50:56,500
Leigh won't betray us.

1085
00:50:58,333 --> 00:51:00,667
She knows we're watching.

1086
00:51:00,667 --> 00:51:02,292
She got our message.

1087
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:05,375
- [Carla] Maybe we need to
send her another message.

1088
00:51:06,833 --> 00:51:08,250
- [Brendan] How long had Allan
been receiving these letters

1089
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:09,667
from Leona?

1090
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:12,583
- A few months.

1091
00:51:13,667 --> 00:51:16,167
And they were
patently ridiculous.

1092
00:51:16,167 --> 00:51:17,458
She was talking about nights

1093
00:51:17,458 --> 00:51:19,167
where Allan and I
had been together,

1094
00:51:20,333 --> 00:51:23,625
describing things that I
knew just weren't Allan.

1095
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:27,167
- Did you think there was any
truth in what she was writing?

1096
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,000
- No.

1097
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:30,750
No, I didn't.

1098
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:33,000
I just wished he would have
turned them over to the dean.

1099
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,167
- Why didn't he?

1100
00:51:34,167 --> 00:51:35,125
- I don't know, I told him.

1101
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:36,792
He was just too good-hearted.

1102
00:51:36,792 --> 00:51:38,500
He was a friend of their family

1103
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,542
and he just couldn't
bear to hurt her.

1104
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,958
- [Anne] Brought you some tea
before I go back to the city.

1105
00:51:46,208 --> 00:51:48,333
And the mail came.

1106
00:51:48,333 --> 00:51:49,125
Lots of cards.

1107
00:51:50,083 --> 00:51:51,667
- Thank you, Anne.

1108
00:51:51,667 --> 00:51:53,667
- Now you sure I can't do
anything else before I go?

1109
00:51:53,667 --> 00:51:54,500
- No, it's all right.

1110
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:55,333
- No?

1111
00:51:56,292 --> 00:51:57,250
I'll get going then.

1112
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:58,417
Nice to meet you, Mr. Moody.

1113
00:51:58,417 --> 00:51:59,208
- Likewise.

1114
00:52:00,167 --> 00:52:02,500
- And Karen, we'll cover for you

1115
00:52:03,417 --> 00:52:04,500
until you feel up to coming--

1116
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:05,708
- I'll come in tomorrow.

1117
00:52:06,833 --> 00:52:08,625
Thanks.
- Okay, sweetie.

1118
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,333
- I can't stay here.

1119
00:52:10,333 --> 00:52:11,167
Thank you.

1120
00:52:18,333 --> 00:52:23,042
- It must have been tough.

1121
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:25,750
Being away so much.

1122
00:52:29,167 --> 00:52:33,208
Why didn't you find
a job closer to home?

1123
00:52:33,208 --> 00:52:34,750
- Mrs. Webster was retiring.

1124
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:36,917
I was taking over the business

1125
00:52:36,917 --> 00:52:41,375
and Allan and I would have
finally been financially set.

1126
00:52:43,833 --> 00:52:46,167
- When did you last talk to him?

1127
00:52:46,167 --> 00:52:47,083
- At 10:30.

1128
00:52:47,083 --> 00:52:49,125
He was upset about Laurie.

1129
00:52:49,125 --> 00:52:50,500
- Did he call you
at your apartment?

1130
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,042
- No.

1131
00:52:52,042 --> 00:52:53,333
We were at the airport and,

1132
00:52:54,792 --> 00:52:56,833
because Anne and I went to
Kennedy to pick up a client

1133
00:52:56,833 --> 00:52:59,042
and the plane was late.

1134
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:01,375
We only came home
after midnight.

1135
00:53:01,375 --> 00:53:03,792
And I wanted to
call, but I didn't.

1136
00:53:08,583 --> 00:53:09,708
- Something wrong?

1137
00:53:09,708 --> 00:53:11,083
- It's a letter from Leona.

1138
00:53:12,792 --> 00:53:14,250
She's threatening to kill me.

1139
00:53:23,792 --> 00:53:27,333
- Now Sarah, I need you to
sign these on every page

1140
00:53:27,333 --> 00:53:30,375
and then I want you to
initial where you see an X.

1141
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:32,167
Good.

1142
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:34,667
- And thank you for agreeing
not to take possession

1143
00:53:34,667 --> 00:53:36,417
until the trial's over.

1144
00:53:36,417 --> 00:53:39,083
- Is it okay for us to drop by?

1145
00:53:39,083 --> 00:53:41,333
I want to give the decorators
what they need but--

1146
00:53:41,333 --> 00:53:43,333
- [Sarah] No, no,
no, not a problem.

1147
00:53:43,333 --> 00:53:44,333
- What about Laurie?

1148
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:47,417
- Oh, we'll manage, thank you.

1149
00:53:48,833 --> 00:53:49,792
- And there we are.

1150
00:53:51,208 --> 00:53:54,792
Mr. and Mrs. Hawkins,
welcome to your new home.

1151
00:53:54,792 --> 00:53:58,917
And Sarah, you have found
yourself some fine new owners.

1152
00:53:58,917 --> 00:54:00,917
Now I always bring along
a bottle of champagne,

1153
00:54:00,917 --> 00:54:02,125
I've got it chilling in the car.

1154
00:54:02,125 --> 00:54:03,333
I can go get it.

1155
00:54:03,333 --> 00:54:05,125
- Well, we really
should be going now.

1156
00:54:06,875 --> 00:54:08,750
- Yes, we've imposed enough.

1157
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:10,208
Save the champagne

1158
00:54:10,208 --> 00:54:11,708
for the day we finally
throw these squatters out.

1159
00:54:15,333 --> 00:54:17,375
(laughs)

1160
00:54:27,833 --> 00:54:30,292
(slow music)

1161
00:54:45,667 --> 00:54:48,958
(phone ringing)

1162
00:54:48,958 --> 00:54:49,875
- Hello?

1163
00:54:49,875 --> 00:54:51,583
- Sarah, it's Mark Levine.

1164
00:54:51,583 --> 00:54:53,000
- Hey, Mark, what's up?

1165
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,667
- Karen Grant just got a
threatening letter from Leona.

1166
00:54:56,667 --> 00:54:59,000
The handwriting is
identical to the others.

1167
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,500
- Oh no.

1168
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,292
- It's a clear violation
of Laurie's bail

1169
00:55:03,292 --> 00:55:04,792
and Mrs. Grant is
on the warpath.

1170
00:55:04,792 --> 00:55:08,792
I have no choice but to
return Laurie to custody.

1171
00:55:08,792 --> 00:55:11,708
(Laurie screaming)

1172
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:19,917
- Please believe me,
he'll never stop.

1173
00:55:21,333 --> 00:55:22,750
He'll never stop.

1174
00:55:24,125 --> 00:55:26,292
(screams)

1175
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:48,167
(clears throat)

1176
00:55:48,167 --> 00:55:50,625
- Laurie, I need to
speak with Debbie.

1177
00:55:54,667 --> 00:55:56,375
Why'd the picture
scare you, Debbie?

1178
00:55:57,583 --> 00:55:59,833
- I can't tell you.

1179
00:55:59,833 --> 00:56:01,458
- Debbie, why can't you tell me?

1180
00:56:03,458 --> 00:56:04,375
Why not, Debbie?

1181
00:56:06,167 --> 00:56:08,125
No, no, no more secrets, Debbie.

1182
00:56:08,125 --> 00:56:09,375
No more secrets.

1183
00:56:09,375 --> 00:56:10,958
We need to know and
we need to know now.

1184
00:56:10,958 --> 00:56:15,083
- Well, just burn the damn
photograph, it's dangerous!

1185
00:56:15,083 --> 00:56:16,417
- Why's it dangerous, Kate?

1186
00:56:16,417 --> 00:56:17,667
You know where it was taken?

1187
00:56:17,667 --> 00:56:19,958
- We all know and
we're not talking.

1188
00:56:19,958 --> 00:56:22,333
Every word brings the
knife a little closer.

1189
00:56:27,667 --> 00:56:30,583
- Debbie's exactly like
she was at four years old.

1190
00:56:30,583 --> 00:56:31,667
And the other one, Kate,

1191
00:56:31,667 --> 00:56:33,708
is a close impersonation
of my mother.

1192
00:56:33,708 --> 00:56:34,667
- Kate's the protector.

1193
00:56:34,667 --> 00:56:35,917
She's based on the adult

1194
00:56:35,917 --> 00:56:37,667
who protected Laurie
most at that age.

1195
00:56:37,667 --> 00:56:39,875
- Justin, I need to
know more about this.

1196
00:56:39,875 --> 00:56:41,500
The trial date gets
closer every day

1197
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,667
and we still haven't found
anything that might cast a doubt

1198
00:56:43,667 --> 00:56:45,625
on the police version
of what happened.

1199
00:56:47,625 --> 00:56:48,833
- Have you heard
anything from Moody?

1200
00:56:48,833 --> 00:56:51,000
- He's still nosing
around the campus

1201
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,625
but believe me, if
he found anything,

1202
00:56:52,625 --> 00:56:54,625
he'd be shouting it
from the rooftops.

1203
00:56:54,625 --> 00:56:56,000
I need to be in on the sessions.

1204
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
- Sarah.

1205
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,250
- If I'm gonna save her,

1206
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:00,667
I need to know exactly
how her alters operate.

1207
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:02,292
I want to be in on the sessions.

1208
00:57:03,208 --> 00:57:04,042
- Okay.

1209
00:57:05,292 --> 00:57:06,750
But you may not
like what you see.

1210
00:57:09,542 --> 00:57:12,708
- Everybody knew Sexy Allan
had to be seeing someone.

1211
00:57:14,125 --> 00:57:17,000
Always saw him sneaking around
the campus late at night.

1212
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,333
He was seeing someone.

1213
00:57:18,333 --> 00:57:20,083
- You think it
could've been Laurie?

1214
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,292
- Well, one time
I was teasing her

1215
00:57:23,292 --> 00:57:26,500
about not having a boyfriend,
she said there was someone.

1216
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:27,917
- Who?

1217
00:57:27,917 --> 00:57:28,917
- She wouldn't tell.

1218
00:57:29,833 --> 00:57:32,000
Then I asked when she dated him

1219
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,542
because she never
went out on weekends.

1220
00:57:33,542 --> 00:57:35,417
She said "What's the point?

1221
00:57:35,417 --> 00:57:37,333
"He's busy on weekends."

1222
00:57:40,875 --> 00:57:43,125
(knocking)

1223
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,000
- [Gregg] Hi.

1224
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:48,917
- Hi.

1225
00:57:48,917 --> 00:57:50,167
- I heard Laurie was in jail.

1226
00:57:50,167 --> 00:57:52,292
I just figured it'd
be safe to come over.

1227
00:57:53,833 --> 00:57:55,083
- Gregg.

1228
00:57:55,083 --> 00:57:57,125
- Nobody's telling
me anything, Sarah.

1229
00:57:57,125 --> 00:57:59,333
And I'm so worried about her.

1230
00:57:59,333 --> 00:58:00,792
I want to help.

1231
00:58:00,792 --> 00:58:02,708
I can't stand by and
watch this happen.

1232
00:58:04,333 --> 00:58:05,333
- Come on in.

1233
00:58:05,333 --> 00:58:06,167
- Thanks.

1234
00:58:11,083 --> 00:58:12,583
I never felt closer to anyone.

1235
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,958
You know, I could've sworn
she felt the same way.

1236
00:58:15,958 --> 00:58:17,625
- You guys made a great couple.

1237
00:58:17,625 --> 00:58:19,875
Our parents were hoping
to be grandparents.

1238
00:58:19,875 --> 00:58:21,292
- Yeah.

1239
00:58:21,292 --> 00:58:23,250
We're a ways from
being that close.

1240
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,292
- What happened between you two?

1241
00:58:25,292 --> 00:58:28,583
- One morning, she just came
over and she started screaming

1242
00:58:28,583 --> 00:58:30,500
that she never wanted
to see me again.

1243
00:58:32,583 --> 00:58:35,000
- Do you want me to see if
she'll let you visit her?

1244
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,208
- I'd love that.

1245
00:58:36,208 --> 00:58:38,208
But I don't want to
cause her any more pain.

1246
00:58:38,208 --> 00:58:39,375
- Oh, no, I understand.

1247
00:58:39,375 --> 00:58:41,750
But let me run it by Justin.

1248
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:44,250
He's convinced if she discovers
what triggers her anger

1249
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:46,625
and fear, it'll cure her.

1250
00:58:46,625 --> 00:58:49,000
Maybe that's the way
you can help her most.

1251
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:49,833
- Yeah.

1252
00:58:53,542 --> 00:58:55,500
- [Justin] I see Kate
and Leona have seen fit

1253
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:56,750
to write me some notes.

1254
00:58:56,750 --> 00:58:59,500
- Yeah, I don't think
they like you very much.

1255
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:00,375
I'm sorry.

1256
00:59:00,375 --> 00:59:01,667
- Don't apologize.

1257
00:59:01,667 --> 00:59:03,167
The better we both
get to know them,

1258
00:59:03,167 --> 00:59:05,458
the easier it'll be to find
out everything they know.

1259
00:59:09,208 --> 00:59:11,375
- I don't know what that is.

1260
00:59:11,375 --> 00:59:12,750
I must have been doodling.

1261
00:59:15,083 --> 00:59:16,583
- [Justin] They're from Debbie.

1262
00:59:16,583 --> 00:59:19,250
She can't read or write yet,
so she's drawing us pictures.

1263
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:20,250
- What do they mean?

1264
00:59:21,583 --> 00:59:22,417
- Let's ask her.

1265
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,583
(gentle music)

1266
00:59:39,792 --> 00:59:41,792
Can you hear me, Laurie?

1267
00:59:43,125 --> 00:59:44,708
I want to talk with Leona first.

1268
00:59:57,125 --> 00:59:59,708
- I was wondering when you'd
finally want to see me.

1269
01:00:01,208 --> 01:00:02,500
Worth the wait?

1270
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:03,417
- Oh, yes.

1271
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:05,917
- Got a cigarette?

1272
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,667
- No, no, I'm sorry,
I don't smoke.

1273
01:00:10,667 --> 01:00:12,875
- I hope that's the
only thing you don't do.

1274
01:00:16,167 --> 01:00:18,792
- Um, tell me
about Allan, Leona.

1275
01:00:18,792 --> 01:00:22,167
What kind of relationship
did you two have?

1276
01:00:23,375 --> 01:00:25,167
- He was the kiss
and tell, not me.

1277
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,667
- But you'd been to his house.

1278
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:30,042
- Uh huh.

1279
01:00:30,042 --> 01:00:32,375
I went over any time I wanted.

1280
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,167
There was a terrace door
he always left unlocked.

1281
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:41,875
He was so lonely.

1282
01:00:44,792 --> 01:00:48,000
He didn't deserve the
way Karen treated him.

1283
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,333
I would have been so
much better for him.

1284
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:52,208
- Would have been?

1285
01:00:52,208 --> 01:00:53,875
You weren't sleeping with him?

1286
01:00:53,875 --> 01:00:57,333
- I told you, I
don't kiss and tell.

1287
01:00:57,333 --> 01:00:58,167
- Right.

1288
01:00:59,833 --> 01:01:01,542
Tell me about the
night Allan died.

1289
01:01:02,667 --> 01:01:04,500
- I don't want to talk
about that either.

1290
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:05,708
- Okay.

1291
01:01:05,708 --> 01:01:07,417
Then can you tell
me how you felt

1292
01:01:07,417 --> 01:01:08,750
when you knew he was dead?

1293
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:13,167
- Look, I'm sorry
I had the knife.

1294
01:01:13,167 --> 01:01:15,000
I was so angry at him.

1295
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,750
I shouldn't have brought
it along but I did,

1296
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:19,917
but I won't talk about it.

1297
01:01:21,208 --> 01:01:22,542
- I wanna talk with Debbie.

1298
01:01:24,625 --> 01:01:27,333
(Laurie giggles)

1299
01:01:29,917 --> 01:01:32,667
I got your pictures, Debbie.

1300
01:01:32,667 --> 01:01:33,875
Wanna tell me what they are?

1301
01:01:40,583 --> 01:01:43,167
- Um, that one is a little girl

1302
01:01:44,542 --> 01:01:49,000
and a man singing and
rocking in a rocking chair.

1303
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,167
- Rocking in a rocking chair.

1304
01:01:50,167 --> 01:01:51,000
That sounds like fun.

1305
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,625
What are they singing?

1306
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:53,667
- They're singing.

1307
01:01:53,667 --> 01:01:57,375
♪ East Side, West Side ♪

1308
01:01:57,375 --> 01:02:01,208
♪ All around the town ♪

1309
01:02:01,208 --> 01:02:04,333
(screaming)

1310
01:02:04,333 --> 01:02:05,167
- Debbie?

1311
01:02:06,833 --> 01:02:08,500
Debbie, Debbie, Debbie?

1312
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:09,333
It's all right.

1313
01:02:09,333 --> 01:02:11,125
(crying)

1314
01:02:11,125 --> 01:02:12,917
What's wrong, what's wrong?

1315
01:02:12,917 --> 01:02:16,000
- It's time to go upstairs.

1316
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,417
I don't wanna go!

1317
01:02:19,167 --> 01:02:21,167
I don't wanna go!

1318
01:02:21,167 --> 01:02:23,083
- [Justin] You don't
have to go today,

1319
01:02:23,083 --> 01:02:24,667
you don't have to go today.

1320
01:02:24,667 --> 01:02:27,583
You don't have to
go today, Debbie.

1321
01:02:29,333 --> 01:02:31,958
- Hope you got enough room
for another patient, Doc,

1322
01:02:31,958 --> 01:02:34,292
because this case is
starting to drive me nuts.

1323
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:35,333
- You haven't found anything?

1324
01:02:35,333 --> 01:02:36,333
- No.

1325
01:02:36,333 --> 01:02:37,625
There's enough smoke to suggest

1326
01:02:37,625 --> 01:02:40,375
that Grant was lighting
somebody's fire,

1327
01:02:40,375 --> 01:02:42,500
but I can't figure out who.

1328
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,208
- Well, it may have been Laurie.

1329
01:02:44,208 --> 01:02:47,542
Leona's a very sensual woman,
she was obsessed with him.

1330
01:02:48,958 --> 01:02:51,875
And having that knife is
definitely not a good sign.

1331
01:02:51,875 --> 01:02:53,667
- Well, maybe I should
take another run

1332
01:02:53,667 --> 01:02:55,708
at the professor's wife.

1333
01:02:55,708 --> 01:02:57,208
She's got an airtight alibi

1334
01:02:57,208 --> 01:02:59,417
but I still feel that I
can get something from her.

1335
01:02:59,417 --> 01:03:02,125
- I spoke with Laurie about
Gregg earlier this afternoon.

1336
01:03:02,125 --> 01:03:03,167
She's agreed to see him.

1337
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:04,583
- That's good.

1338
01:03:04,583 --> 01:03:05,833
I'm convinced that whatever
happened between them

1339
01:03:05,833 --> 01:03:07,667
is somehow related to
whoever abused her.

1340
01:03:07,667 --> 01:03:11,458
If she can trust him
again, she may open up.

1341
01:03:11,458 --> 01:03:12,708
- One problem solves the other.

1342
01:03:12,708 --> 01:03:13,875
- Exactly.

1343
01:03:13,875 --> 01:03:15,000
- Tell me something.

1344
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:18,792
You think any of this
other stuff is related?

1345
01:03:18,792 --> 01:03:19,583
- What do you mean?

1346
01:03:19,583 --> 01:03:21,000
- I don't know.

1347
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,750
Chicken head seems a
long way out of its turf.

1348
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:25,667
Knife goes missing
well before Laurie

1349
01:03:25,667 --> 01:03:27,417
and lover boy have
their blow up.

1350
01:03:27,417 --> 01:03:28,292
Chicken, picture.

1351
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:30,667
I don't know, it all seems to me

1352
01:03:30,667 --> 01:03:32,417
like somebody's trying
to shake her up.

1353
01:03:32,417 --> 01:03:33,833
- Who?

1354
01:03:33,833 --> 01:03:34,667
Why?

1355
01:03:34,667 --> 01:03:36,833
- Hey, I'm just a cop.

1356
01:03:36,833 --> 01:03:38,000
You're the college boy.

1357
01:03:39,417 --> 01:03:42,792
Look, all I'm saying is it's
a little out of the ordinary.

1358
01:03:42,792 --> 01:03:45,042
- Yeah, well, we better
come up with something fast.

1359
01:03:45,042 --> 01:03:47,625
Right now, the only
responsible option I have

1360
01:03:47,625 --> 01:03:49,000
is pleading her guilty.

1361
01:03:51,042 --> 01:03:52,167
By reason of insanity.

1362
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:58,833
- Okay, Laurie, I
just want you to relax

1363
01:03:58,833 --> 01:04:00,083
and go with whatever you feel.

1364
01:04:00,083 --> 01:04:01,667
Sarah and I are
right here with you.

1365
01:04:02,667 --> 01:04:04,542
It's early on a Saturday morning

1366
01:04:04,542 --> 01:04:06,458
and you've just gone
to Gregg's house.

1367
01:04:08,417 --> 01:04:10,250
- I'm wearing a dress.

1368
01:04:12,333 --> 01:04:13,917
Hey, sleepyhead.

1369
01:04:13,917 --> 01:04:15,750
Brought you some muffins.

1370
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:17,208
- What are you
doing here so early?

1371
01:04:17,208 --> 01:04:19,000
- I'm going home
for the weekend.

1372
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,083
Look, offer to tag
along is still open.

1373
01:04:21,083 --> 01:04:23,875
- I can't, this term
paper's due tomorrow.

1374
01:04:25,583 --> 01:04:27,000
Blueberry, all right!

1375
01:04:28,083 --> 01:04:29,333
- Once they were open,

1376
01:04:29,333 --> 01:04:31,167
I got them to make
you an extra batch.

1377
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:32,125
- [Gregg] You're amazing.

1378
01:04:32,125 --> 01:04:33,250
- Sure, look, I gotta go, okay?

1379
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:34,500
Call me?

1380
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:35,333
- [Gregg] You bet.

1381
01:04:35,333 --> 01:04:36,583
- Okay.

1382
01:04:36,583 --> 01:04:39,917
- Hey, thanks for
being so thoughtful.

1383
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:43,167
(Laurie screams)

1384
01:04:43,167 --> 01:04:44,625
- Debbie?

1385
01:04:44,625 --> 01:04:46,000
Is that you?

1386
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,042
What did Gregg do
that upset you?

1387
01:04:48,042 --> 01:04:49,500
- He grabbed me.

1388
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:50,750
- Grabbed you.

1389
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:51,625
What happened when
he grabbed you?

1390
01:04:54,792 --> 01:04:57,208
Debbie, what happened
when you were grabbed?

1391
01:04:58,792 --> 01:05:00,083
- I don't know.

1392
01:05:01,417 --> 01:05:04,792
Whenever he grabbed
me, I floated away.

1393
01:05:13,042 --> 01:05:14,167
- [Billy] 48.

1394
01:05:14,167 --> 01:05:15,000
- All right, 48.

1395
01:05:16,708 --> 01:05:19,500
You know, we can't tell you
how much we appreciate this.

1396
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:21,583
Our architect is finalizing

1397
01:05:21,583 --> 01:05:24,292
the renovation
drawings right now.

1398
01:05:24,292 --> 01:05:25,542
- Yes, he would
have come himself

1399
01:05:25,542 --> 01:05:28,500
but we didn't want to
disturb by strangers.

1400
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:29,792
33.

1401
01:05:29,792 --> 01:05:31,250
- 33.

1402
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:33,333
Oh, we're not keeping you
from anything, are we?

1403
01:05:33,333 --> 01:05:35,125
- No, I'm expecting
a phone call.

1404
01:05:36,333 --> 01:05:38,292
Laurie's being examined
by a court psychiatrist

1405
01:05:38,292 --> 01:05:40,667
and if he approves, her
bail will be reinstated.

1406
01:05:42,417 --> 01:05:43,667
- Wouldn't that be wonderful?

1407
01:05:43,667 --> 01:05:45,208
Carla, that's wonderful.

1408
01:05:47,958 --> 01:05:49,667
- Good news, they released
Laurie into my custody.

1409
01:05:49,667 --> 01:05:52,000
- Oh, thank God.

1410
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,375
- There is nothing
we've wanted more

1411
01:05:53,375 --> 01:05:56,083
than to see dear
little Leigh come home.

1412
01:05:56,083 --> 01:05:58,250
- Laurie, dear, not Leigh.

1413
01:05:59,125 --> 01:06:00,417
- Oh.

1414
01:06:00,417 --> 01:06:02,833
Now I know I've been
working too hard.

1415
01:06:02,833 --> 01:06:05,625
Some days, I don't
remember my own name.

1416
01:06:05,625 --> 01:06:08,417
(laughs)

1417
01:06:08,417 --> 01:06:10,833
- [Vera] I already told the
police everything I know.

1418
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:13,625
- Well, I'm just trying
to get some background.

1419
01:06:13,625 --> 01:06:17,000
Find out what kind of
man Professor Grant was.

1420
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:17,917
- He was wonderful.

1421
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:22,208
- Did you work together?

1422
01:06:22,208 --> 01:06:23,458
- Yes.

1423
01:06:23,458 --> 01:06:24,667
Allan nominated
me for the faculty

1424
01:06:24,667 --> 01:06:26,542
and helped me get the job.

1425
01:06:26,542 --> 01:06:27,708
We became good friends.

1426
01:06:29,042 --> 01:06:30,208
Professional friends.

1427
01:06:32,417 --> 01:06:33,250
- How much,

1428
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,500
(laughs) how much did you
know about his home life?

1429
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:39,792
- Only that he didn't have one.

1430
01:06:39,792 --> 01:06:41,375
Karen came home most weekends

1431
01:06:41,375 --> 01:06:44,375
but she didn't get
involved in his life here.

1432
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:47,375
- Well, she indicated they had
an understanding on all that.

1433
01:06:48,833 --> 01:06:52,167
- All I know is that
he was very lonely.

1434
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:03,167
- How close was your friendship?

1435
01:07:03,167 --> 01:07:07,167
- He used to come by my
place quite often to talk

1436
01:07:07,167 --> 01:07:09,125
or simply to be with someone.

1437
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:12,083
- You know, I've been
hearing a lot of rumors.

1438
01:07:12,083 --> 01:07:13,500
You think he could
have been involved

1439
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:15,625
with one of his students?

1440
01:07:15,625 --> 01:07:17,500
Perhaps Laurie Kinmount?

1441
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:19,542
- Allan would never do that,
he had too much integrity.

1442
01:07:19,542 --> 01:07:22,375
- Miss West, there
had to be something

1443
01:07:22,375 --> 01:07:23,875
to the Sexy Allan reputation.

1444
01:07:23,875 --> 01:07:25,875
A guy doesn't have half the
student body drooling over him

1445
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,083
for no reason.

1446
01:07:27,083 --> 01:07:28,542
I mean, he had to be
involved with somebody.

1447
01:07:28,542 --> 01:07:29,667
- You didn't know him.

1448
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:31,792
He wasn't like that.

1449
01:07:31,792 --> 01:07:33,167
- How can you be sure

1450
01:07:33,167 --> 01:07:35,500
that he wasn't sleeping
with Laurie Kinmount?

1451
01:07:38,750 --> 01:07:40,458
- Because he was
sleeping with me.

1452
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:46,583
(crying)

1453
01:07:50,083 --> 01:07:51,708
- According to Miss West,

1454
01:07:51,708 --> 01:07:55,125
Allan's call to Karen
wasn't to talk about Laurie.

1455
01:07:55,125 --> 01:07:57,167
It was to ask for divorce.

1456
01:07:57,167 --> 01:07:58,750
- I don't know if that
will make much difference.

1457
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:00,875
The Leona alter admits
she was in Allan's den

1458
01:08:00,875 --> 01:08:02,208
with the knife.

1459
01:08:02,208 --> 01:08:03,667
- I don't know, Sarah.

1460
01:08:03,667 --> 01:08:05,667
Maybe it's this crappy
cafeteria food I'm eating,

1461
01:08:05,667 --> 01:08:07,500
but my gut's telling me
there's something more to this.

1462
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,583
- Yeah, well, where
do we go from here?

1463
01:08:09,583 --> 01:08:12,667
- Well, I'm looking over
the campus police records

1464
01:08:12,667 --> 01:08:14,500
for the night of the murder.

1465
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:18,042
Calls on prowlers, break-ins,
anything suspicious.

1466
01:08:18,042 --> 01:08:19,667
Hopefully something
will turn up.

1467
01:08:20,833 --> 01:08:22,333
Get yourself some
rest, all right?

1468
01:08:26,333 --> 01:08:29,417
(Sarah sighs)

1469
01:08:29,417 --> 01:08:30,250
- Leona.

1470
01:08:32,375 --> 01:08:35,667
I want to know what
happened in Allan's den.

1471
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,875
(laughs)

1472
01:08:39,875 --> 01:08:42,667
- I've already told
you, I was there.

1473
01:08:42,667 --> 01:08:47,500
- No, I need to know
exactly what happened

1474
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:50,125
from the moment you walked
through the terrace door.

1475
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,458
- He'd fallen asleep
on the couch, as usual.

1476
01:08:59,375 --> 01:09:00,667
And the door was open.

1477
01:09:11,458 --> 01:09:12,875
I set my bag down.

1478
01:09:16,458 --> 01:09:18,500
- What were you thinking?

1479
01:09:27,708 --> 01:09:29,667
What were you thinking?

1480
01:09:35,583 --> 01:09:39,250
- I was thinking about
how lonely he looked.

1481
01:09:42,917 --> 01:09:46,000
I know what it's
like to feel lonely.

1482
01:09:51,333 --> 01:09:52,833
- What else?

1483
01:09:52,833 --> 01:09:57,542
- I thought of all the times
I wouldn't let Daddy hold me

1484
01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:00,375
after I came home.

1485
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:11,500
We were so much the same.

1486
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:15,500
I just, I...

1487
01:10:16,833 --> 01:10:18,875
I sat down and I cried.

1488
01:10:22,125 --> 01:10:23,583
- [Sarah] What happened next?

1489
01:10:24,792 --> 01:10:25,625
- I...

1490
01:10:28,042 --> 01:10:29,042
I left.

1491
01:10:30,667 --> 01:10:32,708
I heard someone coming.

1492
01:10:32,708 --> 01:10:33,917
- [Sarah] You just left?

1493
01:10:33,917 --> 01:10:38,583
- I heard someone
coming and I got scared.

1494
01:10:40,042 --> 01:10:43,083
- Leona, tell me about the
picture that scared Debbie.

1495
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:46,500
Where'd it come from?

1496
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,667
- It was in our room.

1497
01:10:53,542 --> 01:10:55,417
- You'd seen it before?

1498
01:10:56,833 --> 01:10:57,625
- Yeah.

1499
01:10:58,792 --> 01:11:00,250
Yeah, when she was away.

1500
01:11:01,417 --> 01:11:03,000
- It was taken after
she was abducted?

1501
01:11:03,958 --> 01:11:05,125
Leona, who took it?

1502
01:11:07,708 --> 01:11:08,542
Leona.

1503
01:11:09,625 --> 01:11:12,333
Who took it?

1504
01:11:12,333 --> 01:11:14,250
- The one who took her.

1505
01:11:17,917 --> 01:11:20,000
(crying)

1506
01:11:29,375 --> 01:11:30,250
- She's sleeping.

1507
01:11:32,292 --> 01:11:34,000
- There is no way that
photograph would have been

1508
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:34,917
in her room all these years.

1509
01:11:34,917 --> 01:11:37,250
I mean, if it scared her,

1510
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:39,958
Kate would have gotten
rid of it a long time ago.

1511
01:11:39,958 --> 01:11:41,292
- After the accident,
we searched all over

1512
01:11:41,292 --> 01:11:43,542
for documents the
insurance people needed.

1513
01:11:43,542 --> 01:11:45,167
Could have fallen
from one of the boxes.

1514
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:46,917
- Has anyone been
in the house since?

1515
01:11:46,917 --> 01:11:48,333
- Dozens of people.

1516
01:11:48,333 --> 01:11:50,500
The house has been up
for sale for weeks.

1517
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:53,500
Can you get her to remember
who took that picture?

1518
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:56,125
- That face is locked deeper
than what happened to her.

1519
01:11:59,708 --> 01:12:01,667
- [Brendan] Campus police
picked you up for prowling?

1520
01:12:01,667 --> 01:12:02,708
- I'm no prowler.

1521
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:06,625
I'd been out with some friends

1522
01:12:06,625 --> 01:12:08,500
and it was way past team curfew.

1523
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:11,083
I was just trying to get home
without anybody seeing me.

1524
01:12:12,333 --> 01:12:14,333
That Kinmount girl
was gonna be my alibi

1525
01:12:14,333 --> 01:12:16,292
until I saw the morning papers.

1526
01:12:16,292 --> 01:12:17,500
- Laurie Kinmount.

1527
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:18,667
- Yeah.

1528
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:20,542
- She's not mentioned
in this report.

1529
01:12:22,167 --> 01:12:23,000
- I know.

1530
01:12:24,375 --> 01:12:26,375
I didn't want to get involved,
I was in enough trouble.

1531
01:12:28,542 --> 01:12:30,583
- What time did you see her?

1532
01:12:30,583 --> 01:12:31,833
- After last call.

1533
01:12:31,833 --> 01:12:33,000
One thirty.

1534
01:12:44,333 --> 01:12:45,167
- Hey.

1535
01:12:48,958 --> 01:12:49,792
Got a cigarette?

1536
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:53,125
- Yeah, what's it worth to you?

1537
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,500
- Did you notice any
blood on her clothing?

1538
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:03,000
- No.

1539
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,125
And I was looking real close,
if you know what I mean.

1540
01:13:06,125 --> 01:13:08,208
- [Brendan] Did you
offer her a cigarette?

1541
01:13:09,458 --> 01:13:11,708
- Offered to sell her one.

1542
01:13:11,708 --> 01:13:14,083
Babes like it when I tease them.

1543
01:13:14,083 --> 01:13:15,292
- And did she pay you?

1544
01:13:15,292 --> 01:13:17,292
- She didn't, she wasn't
carrying her purse.

1545
01:13:21,167 --> 01:13:24,667
- Wait here.

1546
01:13:24,667 --> 01:13:26,500
- So I waited, who wouldn't?

1547
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:28,167
She was looking hot.

1548
01:13:30,833 --> 01:13:32,333
- Waited how long?

1549
01:13:32,333 --> 01:13:33,750
- A while.

1550
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:35,875
Was just about to give
up when she came out,

1551
01:13:35,875 --> 01:13:37,833
running full tilt,
hugging her purse.

1552
01:13:39,875 --> 01:13:41,167
She had blood on her bag.

1553
01:13:44,667 --> 01:13:46,750
- She left the knife behind.

1554
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:49,667
- With enough time for
somebody else to use it.

1555
01:13:49,667 --> 01:13:52,667
- Yeah, but she was still
there, Sarah, blood or no blood.

1556
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,625
- But the dots
aren't connecting.

1557
01:13:56,792 --> 01:13:58,500
There is something
else going on here.

1558
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:07,792
(knocking)

1559
01:14:07,792 --> 01:14:09,375
- Oh, hello.

1560
01:14:09,375 --> 01:14:11,583
I'm afraid Karen isn't here.

1561
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:13,000
- It's you I want.

1562
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
- (laughs) Oh, well.

1563
01:14:16,292 --> 01:14:17,125
Have a seat.

1564
01:14:19,583 --> 01:14:20,833
- [Brendan] Tell me what you

1565
01:14:20,833 --> 01:14:22,667
and Karen did the
night Allan died.

1566
01:14:22,667 --> 01:14:26,833
- Well, we went to Kennedy
to pick up an elderly client.

1567
01:14:26,833 --> 01:14:29,542
She called from London
asking for our help.

1568
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:34,042
Poor dear, wasn't
feeling very well.

1569
01:14:34,042 --> 01:14:35,167
- What time was that?

1570
01:14:35,167 --> 01:14:37,625
- That would be before nine.

1571
01:14:37,625 --> 01:14:39,167
Her plane was due in at 9:30

1572
01:14:39,167 --> 01:14:41,250
but it was delayed
until midnight.

1573
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:44,000
- Karen talk to her
husband during that time?

1574
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:49,000
- Yes, he called on her
cell phone about 10:30

1575
01:14:50,167 --> 01:14:51,667
and they talked
for quite a while.

1576
01:14:51,667 --> 01:14:54,167
- And how did she seem
after she hung up?

1577
01:14:56,250 --> 01:14:59,375
- She was angry, you know,
distracted, but we both were.

1578
01:14:59,375 --> 01:15:01,208
Our whole evening was shot.

1579
01:15:01,208 --> 01:15:05,542
So we watched a movie in the
VIP lounge while we waited.

1580
01:15:05,542 --> 01:15:06,833
"Spartacus."

1581
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Oh, and Karen left
to make some calls.

1582
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,167
- You really sat there for
three hours and watched a movie?

1583
01:15:14,167 --> 01:15:17,083
- Well, I may have
dozed off a little.

1584
01:15:17,083 --> 01:15:20,458
I mean, I love "Spartacus"
but I have seen it 50 times.

1585
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:25,792
- Did anything seem
out of the ordinary?

1586
01:15:25,792 --> 01:15:28,167
- Well, when I woke
up, Karen wasn't there

1587
01:15:28,167 --> 01:15:31,083
but a clasp on her
bracelet had come loose

1588
01:15:31,083 --> 01:15:34,000
and she'd been all over
the airport looking for it.

1589
01:15:35,167 --> 01:15:36,000
- Anything else?

1590
01:15:37,375 --> 01:15:39,708
- Well, yes.

1591
01:15:39,708 --> 01:15:43,542
When she drove to the airport,
her fuel light was on.

1592
01:15:43,542 --> 01:15:45,625
I thought we were
gonna run out of gas.

1593
01:15:46,917 --> 01:15:48,333
But when we went home,

1594
01:15:48,333 --> 01:15:50,625
I noticed that the
tank was almost full.

1595
01:16:00,917 --> 01:16:02,625
- Okay, just relax, Laurie.

1596
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:04,667
Going to look in your journal.

1597
01:16:05,667 --> 01:16:07,333
- There's not much new.

1598
01:16:07,333 --> 01:16:09,208
Kate says she hopes
Laurie goes to prison

1599
01:16:09,208 --> 01:16:10,667
so she'll be safe there.

1600
01:16:10,667 --> 01:16:12,333
No one can get to her.

1601
01:16:12,333 --> 01:16:15,500
- So she thinks her job as
protector is almost done.

1602
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:16,792
Anything else?

1603
01:16:16,792 --> 01:16:18,583
- There's a new
drawing from Debbie.

1604
01:16:18,583 --> 01:16:21,500
My dad gave my mom that
necklace when we were teenagers.

1605
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:24,042
It was a kind of an iridescent
stone, a birthstone.

1606
01:16:26,667 --> 01:16:28,458
- Laurie, I wanna
talk with Debbie.

1607
01:16:34,375 --> 01:16:37,125
It's a pretty picture, Debbie.

1608
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:37,958
- No, it's not.

1609
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,125
- [Sarah] Wait.

1610
01:16:42,125 --> 01:16:44,500
- Don't, don't.

1611
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:45,750
- She hated that necklace.

1612
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:47,542
- Don't, don't say that word.

1613
01:16:47,542 --> 01:16:49,875
Don't say that word,
it's a forbidden word.

1614
01:16:49,875 --> 01:16:52,250
- What was the
name of that stone?

1615
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:53,750
- Describe the stone.

1616
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:57,583
- It's a milky white with
bright greens and blues.

1617
01:16:57,583 --> 01:16:58,417
- An opal?

1618
01:16:58,417 --> 01:16:59,250
- No, no, no.

1619
01:17:00,458 --> 01:17:02,917
- Debbie, why is Opal
a forbidden word?

1620
01:17:02,917 --> 01:17:04,750
- No, no, I'm not
supposed to say it.

1621
01:17:05,708 --> 01:17:07,375
I'm not supposed to say it.

1622
01:17:07,375 --> 01:17:09,208
- Do you have any
other forbidden words?

1623
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:10,125
- One, one.

1624
01:17:11,292 --> 01:17:12,208
- Well, we already
know about Opal,

1625
01:17:12,208 --> 01:17:13,625
so you can tell us, okay?

1626
01:17:13,625 --> 01:17:14,458
It's all right.

1627
01:17:18,833 --> 01:17:19,667
- Bic.

1628
01:17:20,833 --> 01:17:23,167
(screaming)

1629
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:35,042
- Debbie, why are the words
Bic and Opal forbidden?

1630
01:17:35,042 --> 01:17:36,542
Who told you that?

1631
01:17:55,667 --> 01:17:58,875
- She learned those words
from the people who took her.

1632
01:18:02,667 --> 01:18:03,667
- Well, you're new.

1633
01:18:05,417 --> 01:18:06,500
What's your name?

1634
01:18:09,083 --> 01:18:10,833
- I don't know you
well enough yet.

1635
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:12,833
- Okay.

1636
01:18:15,167 --> 01:18:16,708
You know who killed Allan Grant?

1637
01:18:22,458 --> 01:18:23,875
- None of us did.

1638
01:18:25,583 --> 01:18:28,500
He was dead when we came
back for Laurie's bag.

1639
01:18:36,917 --> 01:18:38,625
- Tell me what happened.

1640
01:18:41,708 --> 01:18:45,708
- [Woman] Take the knife,
Leona, take the knife.

1641
01:18:49,667 --> 01:18:51,667
(gasps)

1642
01:19:04,667 --> 01:19:06,125
- [Justin] What did you
pick up from the floor?

1643
01:19:06,125 --> 01:19:07,208
- [Laurie] A bracelet.

1644
01:19:08,708 --> 01:19:10,375
I thought it was Leona's.

1645
01:19:12,167 --> 01:19:15,333
- All right, you've
been very helpful.

1646
01:19:15,333 --> 01:19:17,917
We know Laurie didn't
try and hurt Allan.

1647
01:19:19,333 --> 01:19:20,167
Thank you.

1648
01:19:22,333 --> 01:19:23,792
Can you tell us your name now?

1649
01:19:23,792 --> 01:19:25,167
- My name is Leigh.

1650
01:19:32,417 --> 01:19:35,167
(sirens wailing)

1651
01:19:39,625 --> 01:19:40,833
- Thank you.

1652
01:19:40,833 --> 01:19:42,500
- Mrs. Grant, thank
you for coming.

1653
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:44,042
You've met Brendan Moody.

1654
01:19:45,417 --> 01:19:46,917
- Yes.

1655
01:19:46,917 --> 01:19:48,875
I thought we'd already
gone over my testimony.

1656
01:19:48,875 --> 01:19:51,125
- Yeah, we just need to ask
you a few more questions.

1657
01:19:51,125 --> 01:19:52,458
Please, sit down.

1658
01:19:53,708 --> 01:19:54,542
- Sure.

1659
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
- Mrs. Grant, you have
the right to remain silent

1660
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,333
and refuse to answer
any questions.

1661
01:20:04,333 --> 01:20:08,208
Anything you say may be used
against you in a court of law.

1662
01:20:08,208 --> 01:20:10,000
You have the right
to an attorney.

1663
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:10,833
You have the right--
- What are you talking about?

1664
01:20:10,833 --> 01:20:12,375
What's going on here?

1665
01:20:12,375 --> 01:20:15,583
- Is this your signature?

1666
01:20:19,583 --> 01:20:21,333
- Yes, from the gas station.

1667
01:20:21,333 --> 01:20:24,667
We go there all the time, it's
a block away from our house.

1668
01:20:24,667 --> 01:20:27,000
Is this supposed
to be significant?

1669
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,250
- It's dated around the
time that Allan died.

1670
01:20:31,417 --> 01:20:32,417
- That's impossible.

1671
01:20:33,667 --> 01:20:36,667
- Professor Vera West
is willing to testify

1672
01:20:36,667 --> 01:20:39,125
that Allan asked
you for a divorce

1673
01:20:39,125 --> 01:20:40,792
on the night that he died.

1674
01:20:40,792 --> 01:20:42,000
- That's ridiculous.

1675
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,833
- His voice is on her
answering machine,

1676
01:20:45,833 --> 01:20:46,875
saying just that.

1677
01:20:54,333 --> 01:20:57,792
We found this bracelet in
Laurie Kinmount's bedroom.

1678
01:20:59,417 --> 01:21:00,500
Ever see it before?

1679
01:21:03,292 --> 01:21:04,667
- No.

1680
01:21:04,667 --> 01:21:06,333
I hardly know the woman.

1681
01:21:06,333 --> 01:21:07,583
- Are you sure?

1682
01:21:09,458 --> 01:21:13,833
- This appraisal from
the jewelry store
next to your office

1683
01:21:13,833 --> 01:21:15,833
indicates that it
was sold to you.

1684
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:23,000
- I don't, I may
have one like it.

1685
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:23,833
- No.

1686
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:25,792
It's yours.

1687
01:21:27,833 --> 01:21:29,875
You see, the clasp here slips.

1688
01:21:29,875 --> 01:21:31,417
The store offered to change it.

1689
01:21:31,417 --> 01:21:34,667
You were supposed to take it
in the day after Allan died.

1690
01:21:36,583 --> 01:21:38,458
But you didn't keep
the appointment.

1691
01:21:48,208 --> 01:21:50,458
- He said there
was someone else.

1692
01:21:50,458 --> 01:21:53,083
(ominous music)

1693
01:22:15,167 --> 01:22:16,708
You creep!

1694
01:22:16,708 --> 01:22:18,000
You've been sleeping with her,

1695
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,500
you've been sleeping with her!

1696
01:22:21,542 --> 01:22:23,625
(crying)

1697
01:22:37,250 --> 01:22:38,625
I really loved him.

1698
01:22:42,083 --> 01:22:43,083
I loved him.

1699
01:22:44,208 --> 01:22:46,417
- Opal, this is such good news.

1700
01:22:46,417 --> 01:22:48,625
Our Leigh is finally free.

1701
01:22:48,625 --> 01:22:51,458
Opal, we must go
and embrace her.

1702
01:22:51,458 --> 01:22:54,292
- Billy, please try to
understand that you--

1703
01:22:54,292 --> 01:22:55,500
- Look at that face.

1704
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:58,083
She still looks
like a little girl.

1705
01:22:58,083 --> 01:22:59,333
Look at her face.

1706
01:22:59,333 --> 01:23:01,750
- Stop it, Billy, stop
saying things like that!

1707
01:23:02,917 --> 01:23:05,750
(smacks)

1708
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:07,917
- The universe tells
me what I need to do.

1709
01:23:07,917 --> 01:23:09,417
- Really?

1710
01:23:09,417 --> 01:23:12,583
Then what does the universe
tell you to do about this?

1711
01:23:12,583 --> 01:23:14,167
They lied to us.

1712
01:23:14,167 --> 01:23:15,000
It's an expose.

1713
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,167
- Leigh can't see
this photograph.

1714
01:23:21,167 --> 01:23:22,000
She can't.

1715
01:23:29,833 --> 01:23:30,667
- No, no!

1716
01:23:35,708 --> 01:23:36,792
Please don't!

1717
01:23:40,625 --> 01:23:42,625
(gasps)

1718
01:23:44,667 --> 01:23:45,583
- The knife dream?

1719
01:23:47,792 --> 01:23:49,125
- It's all right.

1720
01:23:49,125 --> 01:23:50,625
I told you it would intensify

1721
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:52,167
before it disappears, remember?

1722
01:23:53,208 --> 01:23:55,125
Old fears kinda die hard.

1723
01:24:04,417 --> 01:24:05,917
- The sun's come out.

1724
01:24:05,917 --> 01:24:07,875
- What do you say
we go for a walk?

1725
01:24:07,875 --> 01:24:09,083
We'll work up an appetite

1726
01:24:09,083 --> 01:24:10,833
before our last
dinner at the house.

1727
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:12,833
- Okay.

1728
01:24:12,833 --> 01:24:13,792
- You guys go ahead.

1729
01:24:13,792 --> 01:24:15,333
I got a couple calls to make.

1730
01:24:15,333 --> 01:24:17,333
- [Sarah] Okay, come on.

1731
01:24:33,542 --> 01:24:36,292
- [Laurie] It was a day just
like this when I left you.

1732
01:24:37,708 --> 01:24:39,667
- [Sarah] You didn't leave,
somebody took you from me.

1733
01:24:39,667 --> 01:24:43,500
- No, I wasn't supposed
to be out front.

1734
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:46,500
You know, no matter
what you or Justin say,

1735
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:49,208
if I'd have listened to you,
it wouldn't have happened.

1736
01:24:50,625 --> 01:24:52,500
- If somebody grabbed
one of those little girls

1737
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:55,167
and they wanted to hurt her,
would that be her fault?

1738
01:25:02,083 --> 01:25:02,917
- No.

1739
01:25:03,833 --> 01:25:05,167
No, it wouldn't.

1740
01:25:06,333 --> 01:25:09,833
- Then forgive yourself
like you forgive her.

1741
01:25:12,667 --> 01:25:14,625
- I didn't know
what to do, Sarah.

1742
01:25:16,333 --> 01:25:18,000
He put me in his car.

1743
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:22,625
I was crying and the
lady with him slapped me.

1744
01:25:24,375 --> 01:25:27,833
Then he grabbed
me and he hurt me.

1745
01:25:31,042 --> 01:25:34,458
We'd sing, we'd sing
all around the town.

1746
01:25:37,833 --> 01:25:40,000
He's in the rocking chair.

1747
01:25:41,667 --> 01:25:42,792
- Who, who, Laurie?

1748
01:25:42,792 --> 01:25:43,667
Who was he?

1749
01:25:45,667 --> 01:25:47,292
- His name was Bic.

1750
01:25:49,333 --> 01:25:52,792
And Opal, and she'd
slap me when I cried.

1751
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:59,000
Don't make any noise,
Leigh, he'll use the knife.

1752
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,500
- Leigh?

1753
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:01,750
- Their names were Bic and
Opal and they called you Leigh?

1754
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:02,875
- There is nothing
we've wanted more

1755
01:26:02,875 --> 01:26:05,458
than to see dear
little Leigh come home.

1756
01:26:05,458 --> 01:26:06,708
- Oh my god.

1757
01:26:06,708 --> 01:26:08,875
- Bic, he killed my chicken.

1758
01:26:10,708 --> 01:26:14,875
And Opal said he'd do
the same if I told.

1759
01:26:14,875 --> 01:26:17,667
I couldn't tell,
I couldn't tell.

1760
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:20,042
- It's okay.

1761
01:26:20,042 --> 01:26:24,208
- No one is going to
hurt you again, Laurie.

1762
01:26:24,208 --> 01:26:25,792
- Let's get her inside.

1763
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:26,708
- [Sarah] Yeah.

1764
01:26:26,708 --> 01:26:28,583
- [Justin] We'll call Moody.

1765
01:26:28,583 --> 01:26:30,833
- It's gonna be okay, hon.

1766
01:26:30,833 --> 01:26:31,667
It's okay.

1767
01:26:34,167 --> 01:26:38,042
- Did my alters know all
this and keep it from me?

1768
01:26:38,042 --> 01:26:38,875
- Yes.

1769
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:40,917
And now that you've remembered,

1770
01:26:40,917 --> 01:26:43,042
they'll begin to blend into you.

1771
01:26:43,042 --> 01:26:46,375
- Because they've been parts
of who I really am all along.

1772
01:26:46,375 --> 01:26:47,583
- Yes.

1773
01:26:47,583 --> 01:26:50,000
Debbie is the child
you used to be.

1774
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,458
Kate is your sense
of self-preservation.

1775
01:26:52,458 --> 01:26:56,167
Leona is the self you suppressed
because of what happened.

1776
01:26:59,000 --> 01:26:59,958
- I'm a sex kitten?

1777
01:27:01,542 --> 01:27:03,417
What about Leigh?

1778
01:27:03,417 --> 01:27:04,917
- Leigh was the key.

1779
01:27:04,917 --> 01:27:07,333
He was the imaginary friend

1780
01:27:07,333 --> 01:27:09,625
who floated you
away from the pain.

1781
01:27:09,625 --> 01:27:10,833
He helped you endure

1782
01:27:10,833 --> 01:27:12,583
until the others could
assume their roles.

1783
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:16,750
What did Moody have to say?

1784
01:27:16,750 --> 01:27:19,000
- He's got every cop in
the area on the case.

1785
01:27:20,458 --> 01:27:22,833
Moody wants Justin and I to
go to the command center now.

1786
01:27:22,833 --> 01:27:25,292
Are you sure you'll be okay?

1787
01:27:25,292 --> 01:27:28,167
- I'm okay with this,
Sarah, don't worry.

1788
01:27:36,083 --> 01:27:38,583
(dog barking)

1789
01:28:08,667 --> 01:28:11,333
(ominous music)

1790
01:28:47,625 --> 01:28:49,333
What are you doing here?

1791
01:28:49,333 --> 01:28:51,250
- You forgot your
promise, didn't you?

1792
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:55,167
Make sure we are not disturbed.

1793
01:28:57,833 --> 01:29:00,333
(slow music)

1794
01:29:05,583 --> 01:29:06,667
Time to go upstairs.

1795
01:29:09,875 --> 01:29:11,125
I'm sorry, Leigh,

1796
01:29:11,125 --> 01:29:13,125
but you knew this would
happen if you talked.

1797
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:17,875
You thought I'd left
you behind, huh?

1798
01:29:17,875 --> 01:29:20,667
No, I never forgot you.

1799
01:29:22,083 --> 01:29:24,333
You were such a
dear, sweet girl.

1800
01:29:27,708 --> 01:29:29,125
I touched you at the funeral,

1801
01:29:30,292 --> 01:29:32,458
I had to get close to you again.

1802
01:29:32,458 --> 01:29:35,083
- I felt your evil
presence in the church.

1803
01:29:37,167 --> 01:29:40,792
That's why I fainted, but I
am not afraid of you anymore!

1804
01:29:42,292 --> 01:29:44,167
Now it's your turn
to feel trapped.

1805
01:29:45,792 --> 01:29:46,625
- Drop it!

1806
01:29:48,958 --> 01:29:49,792
- Freeze!

1807
01:29:51,667 --> 01:29:53,708
(smacks)

1808
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,500
- I'm okay, Sarah.

1809
01:30:00,667 --> 01:30:01,500
It's over.

1810
01:30:03,750 --> 01:30:05,500
This time, it's over.

1811
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:14,000
- Yep, Moody's quite a guy.

1812
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,750
Stops for coffee, he sees
the picture of Bic and Opal,

1813
01:30:16,750 --> 01:30:18,833
and puts two and two together.

1814
01:30:19,958 --> 01:30:21,333
- Well, you're quite
a guy yourself.

1815
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:22,833
Wasn't for you, we
wouldn't know their names.

1816
01:30:22,833 --> 01:30:25,000
- Well, I think we
owe it all to her.

1817
01:30:26,417 --> 01:30:29,500
Took a lot of courage for
her to agree to be bait.

1818
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:32,500
- I can't remember the last
time she was this happy.

1819
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:33,833
- Well, she's with
someone she loves.

1820
01:30:33,833 --> 01:30:36,167
I hear it does that to you.

1821
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:40,333
- So will her alters come back?

1822
01:30:40,333 --> 01:30:41,667
- Not likely.

1823
01:30:41,667 --> 01:30:44,333
She doesn't need their
protection anymore.

1824
01:30:44,333 --> 01:30:45,917
- Any signs I should look for?

1825
01:30:45,917 --> 01:30:47,667
- You know, I think you should
stop worrying about Laurie

1826
01:30:47,667 --> 01:30:49,792
and try and get on
with your own life.

1827
01:30:51,333 --> 01:30:52,792
Let's leave the kids to play.

1828
01:30:53,833 --> 01:30:56,250
(calm music)

1829
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:04,292
(dramatic music)
