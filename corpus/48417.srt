You know your problem? You're always
talking about X but thinking about Y.

3
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,997
You've gotta learn to talk about Y.
Forget about X. X is gonna take care of itself.

4
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,953
- What are you talking about?
- Just hear yourself.

5
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,830
Listen to what you're saying under what you
think you're saying: control, control, control.

6
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,390
When are you gonna realise nothing
can be controlled? We live in chaos.

7
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,711
lt's the central issue in everyone's life.

8
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,271
Mack, look around you. Everyone in
this parking lot is struggling for control.

9
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,672
And you know what it is they're trying
to control, each and every one of 'em?

10
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,558
Fear. They're trying to control their fear.

11
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,758
- Thanks for the game, Davis.
- You're my best friend. Let's talk tomorrow.

12
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,229
- Good night, Mack.
- Good night, Vanessa.

13
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,070
l have more to say about this.

14
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,913
Why is it, when someone's
successful in one field,...

15
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,039
- ..they think they know about everything?
- Drive carefully.

Now, this truck is my responsibility.

120
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,318
Now the car's hooked up to it,
l'm responsible for that, too.

Any shit comes down now, it's my ass.
You follow me?

122
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,669
Do you think l'm stupid? Just answer me
that first and then we can talk.

123
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,070
l don't know nothin' about you,
you don't know nothin' about me.

124

l don't know if you're stupid
or some kinda genius.

So l'm askin' you a favour
for the second time.

127

Let me go my way here.

128
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,995
l'm gonna grant you that favour.

129
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,073
And l'm gonna expect you
to remember this if we ever meet again.

130
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,196
- Yeah.
- But first...

131
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,955
..you gotta answer one more thing for me,
and you gotta tell me the truth.

132
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,952
Are you askin' me a favour
as a sign of respect,...

133
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,635
..or are you askin' me a favour
cos l got the gun?

134
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,519
Man, the world ain't supposed
to work like this.

135
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,912
l mean, maybe you don't know that,
but this ain't the way it's supposed to be.

without asking you if l can.

137

That dude is supposed to be able to wait
with his car without you rippin' him off.

138

Everything's supposed to be
different than what it is.

139
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,034
So what's your answer?

140
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,159
You don't have the gun,
we ain't havin' this conversation.

141
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,119
That's what l thought. No gun, no respect.

142
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,589
That's why l always got the gun.

00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,517
The Lakers were simply out of sync,

168
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,478
But a stifling defence
and the return of the running game,,,

169
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,314
,,has catapulted LA back into
serious contention now in the West,

170
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,836
They're now just a game and a haIf
back from the Blazers,

171
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,755
The Magic came out hot, as they were putting
up everything, Dennis Scott hit six straight,

172
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,559
Dunleavy wanted a time-out,
His team was down by ten,

173
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,077
Here's Earvin Johnson missing the lay-up,
Divac can't jam it back, Magic breaking out,

174
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,152
This is Sam Vincent of Orlando,
Three on one, The lceman,

175
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,119
Jerry Reynolds stuffiing over Teagle,
Matt Guokas has done a great job,

176
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,555
(phone rings)

177
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,676
- Hello?
- Hello?

178
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,274
- Hi, guys,
- Mack. What's wrong?

179
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,158
- Nothing, l'm fiine, The car died on me,
- (son) Where?

180
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,992
- Down near the Forum,
- Oh, shit,

181
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,071
- Roberto.
- On Manchester?

182
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,675
No, no. Like an idiot, l took a short cut
and got all turned around.

183
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:13,595
- You've never been where l broke down.
- (Roberto) Shit! Are you outta there now?

184
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,750
- Yeah, l'm at a gas station.
- (wife) Good,

185
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,274
You're lucky you got out with your life.

186
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,397
- Roberto, could l talk?
- See you tomorrow, Dad.

187
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,516
Good night, pal,

188
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,479
- Do you want me to come and get you?
- No, If they don't fiinish it, l'll take a cab,

189
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,313
l'll tell you all about my adventure
in the morning.

190
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,915
Adventure? Mack, what happened?
Are you all right?

191
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,673
l'm fine. Go to bed, honey.

192
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,035
- l love you.
- Love you, too,

193
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,633
Bye.

194
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,431
(sighs)

195
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:54,475
You can go swimmin' in the ocean every day
and be perfectly cool, you know.

196
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:59,509
Then one day, just one particular day,
you bump into the big shark.

197
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,751
The big shark don't hate you.
He's got no feelin' for you at all.

198
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:07,038
You look like food to him.
You don't hate a hamburger, do you?

199
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,031
Yeah.

200
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,315
Those boys back there,
they got nothin' to lose.

201
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,598
lf you just happen to be swimmin' along
and bump into 'em, well...

202
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,676
lt might not be worth worryin' about.
lt's like bein' in a plane crash.

203
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,197
Well, that's comforting.
l'm glad you brought that up.

204
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,750
There just seems to be
so many ways to buy it.

205
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,229
Particularly in this city.

206
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,915
l'm amazed at the end of each day
that anybody's alive.

207
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,072
Then other days l think
maybe people aren't so fragile.

208
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:56,553
Things have always been kind of brutal,
and people just keep on going.

209
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,153
You ever been to the Grand Canyon?

210
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,879
- l always meant to go.
- l was there.

211
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,158
- Only takes about nine hours from here.
- l know. We were planning to take my boy.

212
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,356
- How old is he?
- 15.

213
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,671
15? Probably won't wanna go with you now.

214
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,878
Probably go with his friends and
his chick now. You've missed that boat.

215
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,110
- What's his name?
- Roberto.

216
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,397
- Roberto.
- After Roberto Clemente.

217
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,869
No shit?

218
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,394
Man, get yourself to the Grand Canyon.

219
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,837
- Beautiful, huh?
- lt's pretty, all right.

220
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:35,277
But that's not the thing of it.
You can sit right on the edge of it. l did that.

221
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,353
l did everything. l went down in it,
l stayed overnight there.

222
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,274
But the thing that got me was sitting
on the edge of that big old thing.

223
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,990
Those rocks. Man,
those cliffs and rocks, they're so old.

224
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,437
lt took so long for that thing to get
to look like that. And it ain't done, either.

225
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,432
lt happens right while
you're sitting there watchin' it.

226
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,911
lt's happenin' right now while
we're sitting here in this ugly town.

227
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:12,109
When you sit on the edge of that thing,
you just realise what ajoke we people are.

228
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,478
What big heads we got, thinkin' that
what we do is gonna matter all that much.

229
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,438
Thinkin' our time here
means diddly to those rocks.

230
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,035
lt's a split second we've been here,
the whole lot of us.

231
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,159
And one of us? That's a piece of time
too small to get a name.

232
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,676
- You trying to cheer me up?
- Yeah.

233
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,797
Those rocks were laughing at me, l could tell.

234
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:39,113
Me and my worries. lt was
real humorous to that Grand Canyon.

235
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,955
You know what l felt like? l felt like
a gnat that lands on the ass of a cow...

236
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:49,239
..that's chewing its cud next to the road
that you ride by on at 70 miles an hour.

237
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,757
- That's small.
- Yeah. lt's small.

238
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,991
My name is Mack.

239
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,031
Simon.

240
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,433
l said left! l told you left!

241
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,671
- You scum-sucking pig!
- Sorry, mister. l must've heard you wrong.

242
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,309
Get outta there, you piece of shit!

243
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,509
l told you not to move!

244
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,476
- Where's the shot?
- What shot?

245
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,315
- You took out the shot.
- Which shot is that?

246
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,834
The money shot. The bus driver's head.

247
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,196
The brains-on-the-window shot.
The viscera-on-the-visor shot.

248
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:05,354
- We thought we'd show it to you without...
- Put it back. Don't show me anything.

249
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,159
You don't need it.
You're not even giving it a chance.

250
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,552
How's the rear-view-mirror gag
supposed to work without it?

251
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,748
Am l the only one here
who respects the writing?

252
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,108
l gotta help these kids on the bus.

253
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,589
Right, the counsellor in training.

254
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,479
When l get back from camp, l'm gonna
practise driving every time we get in the car.

255
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,949
That gives me a month to relax.

256
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,309
- Have a great time, pal.
- You, too.

257
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,591
- l'll write a lot.
- Yeah.

258
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,598
15 seconds to tell me
all the mother stuff one more time.

259
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,638
Sunscreen, hat, allergy pills,
summer reading, floss.

260
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,314
Watch out for poison oak, Lyme ticks,...

261
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,392
..bears, dragons... pestilence.

262
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,914
Just be careful, OK?
Write if you need anything.

263
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,512
Mom, l'm going to camp, not the army.

264
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,594
- l love you, sweetheart.
- Me, too.

265
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,911
Be happy.

266
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,315
 He's leaving home, bye-bye

267
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,071
- l gotta go. You OK?
- Mm-hm.

268
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,031
- OK. Call you later.
- OK.

269
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,597
- OK, Robby. You ready for an adventure?
- Mm-hm.

270
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,275
We're gonna figure this town out,
you and me. Here we go.

271
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,829
- You ride shotgun.
- OK, Mommy.

272
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,638
- Hey.
- Fuck! You scared the shit out of me.

273
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,392
- The Rolex.
- What? The car? You want it? You got it.

274
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,198
(car alarm)

275
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,192
Asshole. l told you l wanted the watch.

276
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,309
- The bleeding's under control.
- Just barely.

277
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,077
- What have we got here?
- Gunshot wound to the thigh.

278
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,799
Bone, muscle and arterial damage.

279
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,429
- ls he conscious?
- ln and out. Looks like he's coming out now.

280
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:48,548
Severed the sartorius muscle, the anterior
gracilis and partial trauma to the rectus.

281
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,631
Femoral artery?

282
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,311
Jesus, what a mess.
Did the femurjust shatter?

283
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,198
See if it's even possible to save the leg here.

284
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,511
(baby crying)

285
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,911
(baby crying)

286
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,949
You have a soapy head. You do.

287
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,153
What's that?

288
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,550
Yes, l know, l know. OK.

289
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,868
There we go. Right here
where you can see everything.

290
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,994
Yum, yum, yum, yum.

291
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,631
(humming)

292
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,271
Where's that toe?

293
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,999
Here it is. Look at this.

294
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,674
This is gonna look
very good on you, l can tell.

295
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,511
l know. Come here.

296
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,398
Upsy-daisy-doo. OK.

297
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:40,033
- Who's up?
- Mrs Flores and her three sons.

298
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,831
- Then what?
- At 4.30, Mr Duk.

299
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,989
- Mr Duck?
- Mr Duk.

300
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,831
Mr Daffy Duk?

301
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,916
You're awful.

302
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,594
That's why l can't stand you.

303
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,751
(phone rings)

304
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,517
- (whispers) Hello?
- (Mack) Honey?

305
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,431
- Hi, Mack.
- How you doin'?

306
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,956
- (whispers) Good. l'm having a good day.
- Why are you whispering?

307
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,919
Am l whispering? l guess l'm feeling quiet.
l'm sitting out back.

308
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,434
- l talked to Davis,
- How is he doing?

309
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:48,877
Terrible. Apparently the bullet
just tore the shit out of everything.

310
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,669
lt's gonna take a long time to recover,
and then he may have a limp.

311
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,115
- That's awful.
- l can barely hear you, honey,

312
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,191
- l said that's awful.
- Yeah,

313
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:01,876
- Listen, do you still wanna go out tonight?
- No, we can't. l don't feel like it.

314
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,839
- l'll make something here.
- l like the sound of that. l gotta go.

315
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,798
- Mack, don't work late,
- l won't.

316
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,871
Bye, baby.

317
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,431
Surprise, surprise.

318
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,111
Yes, yes.

319
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,990
How's my girl doing today?

320
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,637
Why aren't you...

321
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,195
..out on a date, beauty?

322
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,435
What's with school?

323
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,471
- So?
- Mm?

324
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,352
- Come on, don't give me a hard time.
- Dee, no one knows less about men than me.

325
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,431
You do all right.

326
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:03,715
OK, let me ask you one question first.
Do you like yourjob?

327
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,712
- l know what you're gonna say.
- You can kiss it goodbye.

328
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,635
lt never fails. l absolutely guarantee you
the thing ends with you losing yourjob.

329
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,996
And not because you're the missis now,
livin' in the big house.

330
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:19,392
l don't think that. l wouldn't even want that.
Give me a little credit, will you?

331
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:23,314
One thing l think is so great about him
is how devoted he is to his wife and kid.

332
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,153
You are so full of shit, you know that?

333
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,879
You may not even know, but you really are.

334
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,633
You're sayin' what they all say at first.

335
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,188
l've seen it many times, honey.

336
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:39,149
lf he is so devoted to his wife,
what's he doin' messin' around with you?

337
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:43,438
- He hasn't done anything.
- You told me you were holding hands today.

338
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,478
Big deal. l shouldn't even have told you.

339
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,155
You gotta tell somebody that shit.
That's how you know it's happening.

340
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,549
Otherwise it's too goddamn lonely.

341
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,997
We must be going about
this whole thing wrong or something.

342
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,992
- What thing?
- The love thing.

343
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,310
The touch thing.

344
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,315
Where there's somebody to touch you,
real nice and gentle.

345
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:11,555
- lt doesn't have to be that gentle.
- Whatever.

346
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:16,669
Jane, do you ever feel
like you're just this far...

347
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:21,197
..from being completely
hysterical 24 hours a day?

348
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,189
Half the people l know feel that way.

349
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,475
The lucky ones feel that way.

350
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,633
The rest of the people
are hysterical 24 hours a day.

351
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,474
- Claire, l'm here.
- Hi, Mack.

352
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,711
You forgot to bring in the mail.
There's something here from Carol.

353
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,190
Mack, come on up here.
l wanna show you something.

354
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,711
ls something wrong?

355
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,997
- Whose is it?
- She's beautiful, isn't she?

356
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,229
ls that the Wilson kid?

357
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,113
- Who?
- l don't know.

358
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,795
- What do you mean?
- l don't know who the parents are.

359
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,668
Come on, Claire. Don't make me guess.
Where did it come from?

360
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,273
So? What's the story?

361
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:21,036
l found her. l was jogging, and l heard this
crying, and l looked under these bushes...

362
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:24,317
- Wait. Where was this?
- On Carmelina, just around the corner.

363
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,233
l looked under the bushes and there she was.

364
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,880
- When was this?
- This morning.

365
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:34,112
- This morning? What time?
- Around 9.30, l guess.

366
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,113
- What did the police say?
- Mm?

367
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,949
My guess is the police did not say ''Mm?''

368
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:48,113
So l guess my next guess is
you haven't called the police.

369
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,597
Claire, it's possible this baby was kidnapped
and someone's been looking for it all day.

370
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:00,674
l don't think so. l could tell. But l listened
to the news. There wasn't a thing about it.

371
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,639
They may not have announced it, or
they're waiting to hear from the kidnappers.

372
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,917
This baby wasn't kidnapped,
l can tell you that, Mack.

373
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,993
This baby was deserted by its mother
and it's going to need a new one.

374
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,595
Claire...

375
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,069
- Are you OK?
- l'm fine.

376
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,433
You do know that we have
to call the police right now?

377
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:28,195
Of course, Mack. l haven't
taken leave of my senses.

378
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,829
l just wanted you to see her,
so l waited till you got home, that's all.

379
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,956
She's so beautiful.

380
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,429
l just wanted you to see her.

381
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,472
l told you that baby wasn't kidnapped.

382
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,478
l said ''Mister, there's no way this vehicle
is worth as much as you gonna pay to tow it.''

383
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,314
But he didn't care. He tells me
''lt got sentimental value!''

384
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,278
What's so funny about that? Maybe it did.

385
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:44,638
- Yeah, maybe he got his first piece in there.
- Otis, watch your mouth.

386
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,679
- What did he say, Mama?
- Nothin', baby. Just bring me that meat loaf.

387
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:52,673
Also, this was the car he was sittin' in
the first time he was ever shot.

388
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,957
Man! He had some good times in there!

389
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:02,038
Are we gonna play Roundy-Roundy,
Uncle Simon?

390
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,669
- Uh-uh. Time for bed, little girl.
- One game. Come on, Mama.

391
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,354
You said we could play one game.

392
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,908
(Simon) One game, Mama, please.

393
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,992
ln your pyjamas, teeth brushed. Go on.

394
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,709
Get ready to get whipped, home.

395
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,354
Don't you wanna stay home
and be with your uncle?

396
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:32,228
l gotta go out. l gotta meet some people.
Take it slow, Simon.

397
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,391
- From the shoulders! You still got it!
- l ain't over yet, baby.

398
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,471
Be back soon, Ma.

399
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,278
OK.

400
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:04,596
Anybody come from the shoulders any more,
huh? Anybody got the hands, huh?

401
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:10,196
Man, l wish. Seem like
every time you turn around,...

402
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:14,273
..some sucker's comin' from the pocket...
and he's strapped.

403
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,472
You know, l never laid any shit on you, did l?

404
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,076
l love you, Otis. And l love my sister.

405
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,994
l don't want her to have any more pain
than she's already had.

406
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:35,595
You know, she's suffering here
every night till you come home.

407
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:40,071
We don't even get into that no more. When
we're together, we try and have it be good.

408
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:45,439
lf we ain't talkin' about it, why you gotta
talk about it? lt ain't gonna change nothin'.

409
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:50,230
You sure? Maybe we can figure out...
something together.

410
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:55,713
What, man? You gonna figure out somethin'
that nobody else around here thought of?

411
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,357
- Later, Simon.
- Hey. Hey.

412
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,670
Plenty have gotten out, Otis.

413
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,354
- l don't want out.
- Bullshit.

414
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:15,830
Without my set, l'm nothin'.
They care about me, man.

415
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,593
Hey, you wanna be
gangbanging when you're 25?

416
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,636
Shit.

417
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,109
l'll never live to be 25.

418
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,191
l gotta roll.

419
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,750
l'll call you Friday.

420
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,831
Drive safely.

421
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,158
Kelley!

422
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,318
Kelley!

423
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,155
Mama!

424
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:44,678
Well, look who's up and at 'em. Somebody
leave your curtains open last night?

425
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:48,389
l asked them to. l wanted to see this.

426
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,629
City of the angels.

427
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,109
l have seen the light.

428
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,797
Mazel tov.

429
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,311
l'll be right back.

430
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,271
Hi, Jackson.

431
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:41,469
Let me see that elbow. Go on, just one look.

432
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,119
l wanna see if it's as good as my knee.

433
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:55,673
This is just a scrape, man. Shit, my knee
was a real mess. This thing is just half-bad.

434
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,710
Did Adam push you?

435
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,109
Should we talk to him?

436
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:05,192
- How come?
- He's an asshole.

437
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:10,152
Maybe, but... we could discuss it.

438
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,309
You havin' a bad day?

439
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,672
Did you get a letter from your mom today?

440
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,869
Did she say she missed you?

441
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,918
Oh, man. My mom used to do that.
Made me nuts.

442
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:36,074
They love you so much, they don't even know
it's gonna make you feel terrible.

443
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,232
l missed my mom so much
the first year l came here.

444
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:43,711
And then when she wrote me and said
she missed me... l felt so lonely.

445
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,195
ls that how you feel?

446
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,277
Well, you got me.

447
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:05,269
(Mack) ''Just don't tell him.'' So Harlan
told him anyway. What else would Harlan do?

448
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:08,830
The only way he wouldn't have told him
is if l had told him to tell him.

449
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,753
l don't think l can talk
about Harlan again tonight.

450
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,912
l've been begging you to get away
from him for eight years.

451
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,549
What, so l can go start
a new immigration practice on my own?

452
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,916
The night when l thought those boys
were gonna kill me, l realised...

453
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,356
..l hate fucking immigration law.

454
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,079
No, you don't. You like it
and you're good at it.

455
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:31,675
What you hate is being partners
with an asshole like Harlan.

456
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,639
- We don't have to talk about this.
- Maybe you hate some other part of your life.

457
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:38,871
What? What did you say?

458
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:44,398
When a person thinks they're about to die,
nothing looks like it was worth their time.

459
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:49,474
- That's not what you were gonna say.
- Then l guess l don't have to say anything.

460
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,118
Look, Mack, l don't even know what
l'm gonna say from one second to the next.

461
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:57,795
The world doesn't make any sense to me
any more. What's going on?

462
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:02,954
There are babies lying around in the streets.
There are people living in boxes.

463
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:06,715
There are people ready to shoot you
if you look at them.

464
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,360
And we're getting used to it.

465
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:15,072
The world is so nuts, it makes me wonder
about all the choices that we've made.

466
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:17,151
- Jesus Christ.
- What?

467
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,111
Oh, shit!

468
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,590
Let's see what you... Wow.

469
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,910
Agh! Damn! That smarts!

470
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:31,877
- Hold it up. Apply pressure.
- Pressure, pressure.

471
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:36,431
- The hospital are gonna have to sew that up.
- No. Really? l don't think it's that bad.

472
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,511
Here. Let's see. Take it off.

473
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,397
Oh, God.

474
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,596
- Look at this.
- Under the water.

475
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,876
- See what happens when you yell at me?
- Never again, baby.

476
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:51,590
Maybe next time you'll be a little more
understanding when l bitch about my life.

477
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,114
Ow, ow, ow! Here. Let me, let me.

478
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:57,715
l'm gonna get my purse.
l'm gonna take you to St John's.

479
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:01,634
- You better sit down for a second.
- l don't think l need to get this sewn up.

480
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:04,917
Mack, are you afraid of a few stitches?

481
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,117
l'm not afraid of anything.
l just think we oughta discuss this.

482
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,191
You're kidding, right?

483
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,470
What, are you going into shock?

484
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:19,156
l just hate seeing my blood spill
out of me like that. Does everybody...

485
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,918
Earthquake!

486
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,912
Big one. Let's get outta here. Run!

487
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,560
(Claire) Aren't we supposed to...?

488
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,751
(Mack) l don't care!

489
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,999
- l'm sorry. l'm never complaining again.
- Bullshit.

490
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:39,868
- No, no. l swear.
- You'll forget about all this tomorrow.

491
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,997
Did you feel that? l think
there's an aftershock coming.

492
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:47,311
Sally! Did your chandelier fall down again?

493
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,118
- No.
- Oh, good!

494
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,430
(woman) Claire! Claire!

495
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:54,637
- What's the matter?
- Claire!

496
00:54:54,720 --> 00:55:00,511
lt's Byron. l don't know what's wrong
with him. l dialled 911. The line's busy.

497
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:04,912
- l don't know what's happening.
- lt's gonna be OK. We'll be right there.

498
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,272
- He's bleeding!
- No, he's not. That's Mack.

499
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:24,509
(Claire) Come on, come on, come on.

500
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:29,189
Yes. l need an ambulance right way.
222 Avondale.

501
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:31,717
What?

502
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,310
Yes. Yes.

503
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,798
Male. 79.

504
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:43,149
Heart attack maybe.

505
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,311
(Simon) Hey, Mack!

506
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,358
Mack!

507
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:53,238
Over here! Come on!

508
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,269
Give me a flyby!

509
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:00,071
Yeah!

510
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:58,911
(baby crying)

511
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,195
(distant voice)

512
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:29,791
(baby screaming)

513
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,671
(baby gurgling)

514
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:33,031
(baby crying)

515
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,151
(flies buzzing)

516
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,358
Mack.

517
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:02,431
Mack, wake up.

518
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:10,356
So, now, tell me that again.
You have the baby at home now?

519
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:13,477
- Mack, that's wonderful.
- No, that's not what l said.

520
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:16,597
- l said Claire wants to adopt the baby.
- Claire is so great.

521
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:21,310
So what's the problem? You're not allowed
to just keep every baby you find.

522
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:25,552
- Aren't there laws about that kind of thing?
- There is a process you can go through.

523
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:28,598
And Claire has already
started collecting the forms.

524
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:32,036
She is the most self-actualised
person l ever met.

525
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:33,997
She is this week.

526
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:36,036
- Home sweet home.
- Mr Davis.

527
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:40,238
Hiya, Leonard. Good to see ya.
All right, just toss me in.

528
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:45,314
- Just roll me back and just flip me in.
- l'm gonna go check the car, OK, sweetie?

529
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:52,191
See you back at the house, OK, Tony?

530
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,594
Mabel, l am never gonna
forget the times we had.

531
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:58,877
- As you know, my name is Esther.
- My mother's name was Esther...

532
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:03,351
..and since you have been kinder than my
mother was, l have given you a better name.

533
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:09,310
When l think of the experience that changed
my life, l will think appreciatively of you.

534
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:13,871
You are very kind. Remember,
if you start to feel some pressure in there,...

535
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:15,951
..it's time to get the pus drained.

536
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:18,679
l love it when you talk that way
about the pus!

537
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:22,230
Don't you have a favourite charity
to give this to? A favourite child?

538
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:25,198
A favourite horse?
This is very unusual for me.

539
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:28,556
- l'm notoriously cheap. Ask anyone.
- (Mack) lt's true.

540
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:31,518
- Goodbye, Davis.
- OK, a hug. Come on, a hug, a hug.

541
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:34,319
- OK.
- There we go. OK.

542
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,391
- So long. Bye.
- Take it easy.

543
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,389
(Davis) Leonard, get me outta here.

544
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,110
So, tell me about this life change.

545
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,998
lt's not a life change.
l had some kind of vision,...

546
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:59,152
..some insight,
but l don't wanna talk about it.

547
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:02,835
- Tell him. He's your best friend.
- We're talking about his new baby.

548
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:06,549
Besides, if you talk about stuff,
maybe that takes the place of doing it.

549
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:09,438
- That's never been one of your big problems.
- No kidding.

550
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:13,911
So... Claire wants this baby,
but you're not too high on the idea.

551
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,230
And it's not that you don't like kids.

552
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:20,677
Roberto's maybe the best thing that ever
happened in your life. But he's 15 now.

553
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:23,274
He's pretty much done with you.
He'll be moving out.

554
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:28,388
You thought you'd get back to the freedom
you had back when you were first married.

555
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:31,040
Fact is, you feel
you're getting old way too fast.

556
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:33,714
The last thing you had in mind
was a new family,...
