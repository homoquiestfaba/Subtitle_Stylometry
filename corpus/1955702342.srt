00:00:59,817 --> 00:01:00,785
Hey!

3
00:01:03,387 --> 00:01:05,253
I'm like the anti-Gandhi.

4
00:01:05,255 --> 00:01:07,458
Yeah.

5
00:01:12,996 --> 00:01:16,866
So, what are we gonna do with
ourselves this summer, Madam Iris?

6
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,601
Write a musical. Take it on the road.

7
00:01:19,603 --> 00:01:23,238
- Run for mayor. My platform is "child labor."
- Oh.

8
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,507
- Why not?
- You're so refreshingly candid.

9
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:28,810
We have an entire summer.
We can do whatever.

10
00:01:28,812 --> 00:01:30,646
Quality time.

11
00:01:30,648 --> 00:01:32,150
My goal is to heal.

12
00:01:36,553 --> 00:01:38,823
Mmm, wait, wait. I want
to light my cigarette.

13
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:42,961
Mmm.

14
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,829
To our health.

15
00:01:51,101 --> 00:01:52,202
To our health.

16
00:01:55,271 --> 00:01:56,907
Uh... Swiss.

17
00:01:57,907 --> 00:01:58,876
Okay.

18
00:02:00,077 --> 00:02:01,709
So, you work here?

19
00:02:01,711 --> 00:02:03,446
I'm an unpaid intern.

20
00:02:05,148 --> 00:02:06,650
Uh, you were in my Af-Am Poets, right?

21
00:02:07,216 --> 00:02:09,150
Yeah.

22
00:02:09,152 --> 00:02:11,287
What are you doing on campus?

23
00:02:11,289 --> 00:02:13,322
- I live here.
- Ansbury?

24
00:02:13,324 --> 00:02:14,990
- No way.
- Yeah.

25
00:02:14,992 --> 00:02:17,025
I'm a townie.

26
00:02:17,027 --> 00:02:19,394
I'm at Admissions. We should hang out.

27
00:02:19,396 --> 00:02:20,365
Iris, right?

28
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,201
Sweet.

29
00:02:23,901 --> 00:02:24,903
Jason?

30
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:26,704
Cody?

31
00:02:28,272 --> 00:02:29,905
Wyatt?

32
00:02:29,907 --> 00:02:31,105
Alex.

33
00:02:31,107 --> 00:02:32,873
- Alex.
- Alex.

34
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,842
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

35
00:02:34,844 --> 00:02:35,879
Mmm.

36
00:02:36,914 --> 00:02:38,049
- Hi.
- Hi.

37
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,518
Uh...

38
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,456
Do you have any pimento loaf?

39
00:02:46,223 --> 00:02:47,225
No.

40
00:03:56,826 --> 00:03:58,525
Is it icy?

41
00:03:58,527 --> 00:04:01,229
It looks nippily.

42
00:04:01,231 --> 00:04:03,865
I don't know, Catherine,
I haven't been in yet.

43
00:04:03,867 --> 00:04:07,203
Iris, there comes a time
in every young woman's life

44
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:11,806
where she retires her disposable
razor, and starts to wax.

45
00:04:11,808 --> 00:04:13,775
I'll give you my lady, her number.

46
00:04:13,777 --> 00:04:14,979
I'm on a budget.

47
00:04:27,358 --> 00:04:28,860
It's amazing!

48
00:04:36,267 --> 00:04:38,165
Caramel-flavored liquor.

49
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:41,068
I feel like this changes a person, forever.

50
00:04:46,243 --> 00:04:47,277
Yeah.

51
00:06:04,722 --> 00:06:08,957
Mmm. I feel like Brixner is
absolutely a great school,

52
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:11,325
but I could never stay here for college.

53
00:06:11,327 --> 00:06:14,528
Well, Iris is still functioning at a
high level and she lives here year-round.

54
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:17,131
Yeah, but Iris is of hearty stock, though.

55
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:18,599
I'm more neurotic.

56
00:06:18,601 --> 00:06:20,801
I need New York.

57
00:06:20,803 --> 00:06:22,604
Suburbs do rot your brain.

58
00:06:22,606 --> 00:06:24,806
That's kind of what my thesis is about.

59
00:06:24,808 --> 00:06:26,941
Cultural values in the suburbs.

60
00:06:26,943 --> 00:06:29,878
Basically, I contend that with the
absence of community institutions,

61
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,647
like Little League and church,

62
00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:34,917
children are allowed to
develop their own morality.

63
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:38,052
Like, for instance, let's
say, grow up in a family...

64
00:06:38,054 --> 00:06:39,456
- Ready?
- Mmm?

65
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:43,659
- Okay, hello.
- Oh.

66
00:06:43,661 --> 00:06:46,962
All right, hey, you there?

67
00:06:46,964 --> 00:06:49,063
- All right, let's go.
- Oh, shit.

68
00:06:49,065 --> 00:06:51,532
Hold... Guys?

69
00:06:51,534 --> 00:06:53,234
Wait. Uh, I'll drive?

70
00:06:53,236 --> 00:06:55,106
- Let's walk.
- Okay.

71
00:07:01,811 --> 00:07:03,410
You know what would be truly amazing,

72
00:07:03,412 --> 00:07:06,414
is if it would just be 1% more humid,

73
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,386
and then we would all drown!

74
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,421
This is exactly like high school.

75
00:07:12,423 --> 00:07:16,458
It's fucking, creepy, time-warp shit.

76
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,695
Only you would be wearing a fleece.

77
00:07:19,697 --> 00:07:23,131
And Mae would be talking
about how she hates everyone.

78
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:25,333
Oh, and she'd be asking, "Where's the keg?"

79
00:07:25,335 --> 00:07:27,602
What would Catherine be doing?

80
00:07:27,604 --> 00:07:30,741
This. This is Catherine right here.

81
00:07:31,775 --> 00:07:33,508
Different hair.

82
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,544
I know.

83
00:07:35,546 --> 00:07:39,047
- Man, this is devil shit. It's crazy.
- Mmm.

84
00:07:39,049 --> 00:07:41,852
I steeped the vodka in weed.

85
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:44,854
- Keg ahoy!
- Oh, shit.

86
00:07:44,856 --> 00:07:46,690
Fuck you.

87
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,094
Yeah, it's good.

88
00:07:53,096 --> 00:07:55,229
So... Oh, shit.

89
00:07:55,231 --> 00:07:57,368
Okay, let's do it. Do it.

90
00:08:01,972 --> 00:08:04,008
Sorry. I'm sorry.

91
00:08:07,344 --> 00:08:08,379
Hey.

92
00:08:11,382 --> 00:08:12,981
Thanks.

93
00:08:12,983 --> 00:08:14,414
I wanna go home.

94
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,551
- What?
- Really?

95
00:08:16,553 --> 00:08:21,256
But why? You're completely,
inappropriately sober.

96
00:08:21,258 --> 00:08:24,059
Have a beer at least. It'll be fun.

97
00:08:24,061 --> 00:08:26,664
I can't get Billy out of my head. I...

98
00:08:28,397 --> 00:08:29,833
He hates us.

99
00:08:31,734 --> 00:08:35,670
He will, he truly will,
for the rest of his life,

100
00:08:35,672 --> 00:08:40,341
so either you obsess over
something you can't change

101
00:08:40,343 --> 00:08:43,979
or you just accept it and move on.

102
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,583
It's only been four months, Catherine.

103
00:08:48,518 --> 00:08:51,921
I still wake up thinking she's here.

104
00:08:51,923 --> 00:08:53,758
Then you have a serious problem.

105
00:08:58,928 --> 00:09:00,427
- Hey, Jack.
- Yo.

106
00:09:00,429 --> 00:09:03,398
Can you drive Catherine home later?

107
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,569
Yeah, with aplomb, sure.

108
00:09:06,602 --> 00:09:07,704
Thanks.

109
00:09:09,005 --> 00:09:10,006
Later.

110
00:09:10,707 --> 00:09:11,708
Okay.

111
00:09:44,808 --> 00:09:46,807
Yeah, no shit.

112
00:10:20,443 --> 00:10:22,013
You're the worst.

113
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:57,512
Teaching American literature is not fucked.

114
00:10:57,514 --> 00:10:59,413
When are you coming up?

115
00:10:59,415 --> 00:11:01,983
You want to teach poetry,
not a requirement class.

116
00:11:01,985 --> 00:11:06,321
You've been there for
three years. It's your time.

117
00:11:06,323 --> 00:11:08,726
I just don't know why you're not furious.

118
00:11:11,562 --> 00:11:13,795
When are you coming up?

119
00:11:13,797 --> 00:11:17,599
I found a place in Woodstock that
does wood-fired pizzas in an orchard.

120
00:11:17,601 --> 00:11:19,066
<i>We have Jerry's
opening this weekend.</i>

121
00:11:19,068 --> 00:11:21,936
Oh, no, I can't.

122
00:11:21,938 --> 00:11:26,276
I'm on a new health kick where I'm
cutting back on suicidal feelings.

123
00:11:28,411 --> 00:11:32,980
All right, I'll tell him you're
upstate on a writing retreat.

124
00:11:32,982 --> 00:11:34,584
Which I am.

125
00:11:37,788 --> 00:11:40,157
Oh. My drinks are here.

126
00:11:40,957 --> 00:11:43,191
Get up here, lady.

127
00:11:43,193 --> 00:11:44,227
Okay, bye.

128
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,893
Bye.

129
00:11:49,533 --> 00:11:50,534
Yeah?

130
00:11:54,504 --> 00:11:57,104
- Hi.
- Hi.

131
00:11:57,106 --> 00:12:00,274
Here, contraband. Don't tell.

132
00:12:00,276 --> 00:12:02,677
It was thusly their relationship began

133
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:04,914
with a seemingly harmless secret.

134
00:12:06,616 --> 00:12:09,082
So, you're ahead of the game.

135
00:12:09,084 --> 00:12:11,518
- What game is that?
- Thesis.

136
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,689
Most of my students
don't start till the fall.

137
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,757
Well, I'm here and I'm working at Neon,

138
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:18,325
so it'd be nice to be thinking
about something whilst I'm...

139
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,864
Robotically pushing a child on a swing?

140
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:24,398
Using the meat slicer.

141
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,402
Oh, those things are scary.

142
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,537
So, what are you thinking?

143
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:30,640
Right now?

144
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,676
Yeah, with regard to your thesis.

145
00:12:34,678 --> 00:12:37,313
I want to write a series
of poems about grief.

146
00:12:43,654 --> 00:12:44,822
That's great.

147
00:12:47,723 --> 00:12:50,827
Um, I should tell you that

148
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:54,229
the creative thesis is a beast.

149
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:57,431
Have you considered researching
the history of grief poetry?

150
00:12:57,433 --> 00:12:59,667
I think that you should do that,

151
00:12:59,669 --> 00:13:02,903
not only for your own
edification, but also because

152
00:13:02,905 --> 00:13:06,242
the review committee really eats
it up with a fork and a spoon.

153
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:14,715
"Who is the third who
walks always beside you?

154
00:13:14,717 --> 00:13:18,186
"When I count, there are
always you and I together

155
00:13:18,188 --> 00:13:20,857
"But when I look ahead up the white road

156
00:13:22,558 --> 00:13:27,061
"There is always another
one walking beside you

157
00:13:27,063 --> 00:13:33,869
"Gliding wrapt in a brown mantle, hooded

158
00:13:33,871 --> 00:13:37,271
"I do not know whether a man or a woman

159
00:13:37,273 --> 00:13:41,810
"But who is that on the other side of you?

160
00:13:41,812 --> 00:13:44,448
"What is that sound high in the air?"

161
00:13:46,683 --> 00:13:49,385
T.S. Eliot's <i>The Waste Land.</i>

162
00:13:53,155 --> 00:13:56,327
He loses his goddamn mind in that poem.

163
00:13:59,663 --> 00:14:02,933
Yeah, I should go forth
and learn about all of that.

164
00:14:05,669 --> 00:14:07,969
Yeah, I think if you do that,

165
00:14:07,971 --> 00:14:11,840
that this could be a
really important project,

166
00:14:11,842 --> 00:14:14,609
and I sure as hell would
like to help you out.

167
00:14:14,611 --> 00:14:16,945
- Okay.
- Cool.

168
00:14:16,947 --> 00:14:21,181
So... Yeah, so whenever you want to start.

169
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,118
I'll email you.

170
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,358
- Thank you, Professor McCann.
- Yeah, no problem, anytime.

171
00:14:33,429 --> 00:14:37,130
So, Iris, drinking alone?

172
00:14:37,132 --> 00:14:38,868
You could've called a brother.

173
00:14:42,105 --> 00:14:44,504
Oh, this is stupid.

174
00:14:44,506 --> 00:14:47,141
If I had a brain, I know
this would be ill-advised.

175
00:14:47,143 --> 00:14:50,314
It's the only cure. I've got
four older brothers, trust me.

176
00:14:54,016 --> 00:14:55,419
I'm an asshole.

177
00:15:04,961 --> 00:15:06,130
Ugh!

178
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,303
Oh, yeah!

179
00:15:13,903 --> 00:15:15,402
We're high!

180
00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:20,307
It's coming up!

181
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:23,311
You guys want tomatoes or lettuce?

182
00:15:27,283 --> 00:15:29,550
You guys notice this guy over
here just having a snack...

183
00:15:49,038 --> 00:15:51,008
Whoa!

184
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:57,445
You should come back for dinner!

185
00:16:06,856 --> 00:16:09,590
Hello! Does anybody even work here?

186
00:16:09,592 --> 00:16:11,057
Oh, we've gotta go.

187
00:16:11,059 --> 00:16:13,393
Oh, fuck!

188
00:16:13,395 --> 00:16:16,332
Fuck! Let's go! Shit.

189
00:16:17,534 --> 00:16:19,803
That's for you, sir.

190
00:16:23,874 --> 00:16:25,540
Hi, Iris.

191
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:27,575
Professor McCann, hi.

192
00:16:27,577 --> 00:16:31,211
Um, how's the Forest?

193
00:16:31,213 --> 00:16:33,915
Uh, the Forest is better
than you would think.

194
00:16:33,917 --> 00:16:35,749
Um, I mean, it doesn't look great,

195
00:16:35,751 --> 00:16:38,518
but it's what is inside that makes it hot.

196
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,522
What, it's spicy?

197
00:16:40,222 --> 00:16:41,391
What? No.

198
00:16:43,525 --> 00:16:44,794
Um...

199
00:16:48,231 --> 00:16:49,633
Hey, Iris.

200
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,169
You remember that thing that
we were just talking about?

201
00:16:54,404 --> 00:16:56,870
Yeah. Yes, I, um... Mmm-hmm.

202
00:16:56,872 --> 00:16:58,973
- Yeah. What do you think about that?
- I...

203
00:16:58,975 --> 00:17:01,909
I... You know, um...

204
00:17:01,911 --> 00:17:03,913
Yeah, 'cause that's not
what you just said before.

205
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:06,813
What?

206
00:17:11,821 --> 00:17:13,921
I'm sorry. I'm embarrassed.

207
00:17:13,923 --> 00:17:16,457
Hey, what are you making me?

208
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:18,326
I don't know. What do you want?

209
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,127
First, turkey.

210
00:17:20,129 --> 00:17:21,963
Oh, yeah. Um...

211
00:17:21,965 --> 00:17:24,197
Wait, wait. I take that back.

212
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:26,400
I don't want you anywhere near
that industrial slicing machine.

213
00:17:28,205 --> 00:17:29,773
Oh, shit.

214
00:18:39,242 --> 00:18:41,141
<i>Yes!</i>

215
00:18:41,143 --> 00:18:42,142
Are you sure we're
going to the right place?

216
00:18:42,144 --> 00:18:43,610
Yes, it's this way.

217
00:18:43,612 --> 00:18:45,513
No, I'm serious, Mae. Look at me. Come on.

218
00:18:45,515 --> 00:18:46,982
Look at this!

219
00:18:46,984 --> 00:18:48,683
Whoo!

220
00:18:48,685 --> 00:18:50,320
Come on, Catherine!

221
00:19:23,085 --> 00:19:24,487
Isn't it beautiful?

222
00:19:32,661 --> 00:19:33,697
Iris.

223
00:19:40,102 --> 00:19:42,270
It is I.

224
00:19:42,272 --> 00:19:44,207
Adviser of the thesis.

225
00:19:54,784 --> 00:19:57,118
Does this happen to you frequently?

226
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,521
It's happened before, yeah.

227
00:19:59,523 --> 00:20:01,225
You should see a doctor.

228
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,462
Um...

229
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,265
You can sleep here on the couch.

230
00:20:11,301 --> 00:20:13,270
Or I can drive you home.

231
00:20:19,109 --> 00:20:23,080
Or I can call you a cab.
I'm upstairs. So you can...

232
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,383
You know, whatever, whatever you decide.

233
00:20:29,986 --> 00:20:31,121
Um...

234
00:20:34,457 --> 00:20:35,659
I'll be right back.

235
00:20:52,609 --> 00:20:54,611
Okay, just a little bit.

236
00:21:02,185 --> 00:21:03,186
Okay.

237
00:21:17,266 --> 00:21:19,333
So, why are you home for the summer

238
00:21:19,335 --> 00:21:23,603
instead of doing one of those
feed-the-homeless internships?

239
00:21:23,605 --> 00:21:25,107
I don't wanna talk.

240
00:21:51,199 --> 00:21:52,367
What's wrong? Are you okay?

241
00:21:52,369 --> 00:21:54,371
Sorry, it's a loud door.

242
00:22:14,189 --> 00:22:20,328
I'm here this summer because I
was in a car accident in March.

243
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:23,900
I'm here to be with my friend,
Catherine. She was the one driving.

244
00:22:25,066 --> 00:22:27,436
Our best friend Mae, she was

245
00:22:29,773 --> 00:22:31,408
killed in the crash.

246
00:22:33,109 --> 00:22:35,145
She was in the passenger seat.

247
00:22:38,014 --> 00:22:40,583
I don't know how to live like this.

248
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:43,818
I don't know...

249
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,556
I can't get my head around it,

250
00:22:47,622 --> 00:22:49,124
and I can't accept it.

251
00:22:49,126 --> 00:22:51,324
It just makes no sense.

252
00:22:51,326 --> 00:22:52,428
Mmm.

253
00:22:53,829 --> 00:22:54,931
It doesn't.

254
00:23:12,948 --> 00:23:16,119
I'm here because I
thought I could tell you.

255
00:23:25,227 --> 00:23:26,462
You can.

256
00:25:19,775 --> 00:25:21,175
Hey!

257
00:25:21,177 --> 00:25:24,177
- Can I just get some cheese?
- What?

258
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:25,779
You want bread with that?

259
00:25:25,781 --> 00:25:27,747
Yeah, only if I can get
it in between the cheese.

260
00:25:27,749 --> 00:25:30,216
I'd like to invert the typical
roles of sandwich ingredients,

261
00:25:30,218 --> 00:25:32,820
thereby casting a
spotlight on the stagnancy

262
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:35,789
which has come to characterize
the American lunch.

263
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:38,125
Yeah, we have that. It's called the Tool.

264
00:25:38,127 --> 00:25:40,060
Sweet. Awesome.

265
00:25:40,062 --> 00:25:42,295
Hey, so guess what?

266
00:25:42,297 --> 00:25:44,764
This evening, I'm gonna
have a special screening

267
00:25:44,766 --> 00:25:46,233
of <i>Silent Night, Deadly Night.</i>

268
00:25:46,235 --> 00:25:47,568
Oh.

269
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:50,103
Hey, Santa's a psychosexual killer.

270
00:25:50,105 --> 00:25:51,638
- Tuna on white.
- Huh?

271
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,775
Thank you.

272
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,644
That guy your boyfriend?

273
00:25:56,646 --> 00:25:58,114
No, he's my roommate.

274
00:25:59,215 --> 00:26:01,115
- Hi.
- Hey.

275
00:26:01,117 --> 00:26:03,954
Uh, I'd like a roast beef on
white with tomato and mayo.

276
00:26:06,322 --> 00:26:07,290
Hi, Iris.

277
00:26:09,225 --> 00:26:10,293
Hi, Gerald.

278
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,563
Here you go, lover.

279
00:26:14,463 --> 00:26:15,498
Enjoy.

280
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,801
<i>I can't come up.</i>

281
00:26:20,803 --> 00:26:24,571
What? Why? No, no, no.

282
00:26:24,573 --> 00:26:27,340
I told you about that memoir
I bought, from the Navajo girl?

283
00:26:27,342 --> 00:26:31,579
Remember, the pageant on the reservation?

284
00:26:31,581 --> 00:26:34,747
Yeah, I was literally one hour
away from the first pre-release,

285
00:26:34,749 --> 00:26:38,218
and I find out she's
an Orange County Korean,

286
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,954
headed to Penn.

287
00:26:39,956 --> 00:26:42,022
Wow.

288
00:26:42,024 --> 00:26:45,560
<i>Teenage girls are fucking batshit.</i>

289
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:48,098
Well, can't you just make it fiction?

290
00:26:49,165 --> 00:26:51,465
That's so disgusting.

291
00:26:51,467 --> 00:26:53,065
That's what I'm doing tonight,

292
00:26:53,067 --> 00:26:55,202
rewriting all the press
releases, blah, blah, blah.

293
00:26:55,204 --> 00:26:56,469
How's your writing going?

294
00:26:56,471 --> 00:26:59,372
What, you want a word count?

295
00:26:59,374 --> 00:27:01,844
I should go. I have a
long night ahead of me.

296
00:27:02,512 --> 00:27:03,513
Bye.

297
00:27:04,013 --> 00:27:05,015
Bye.

298
00:27:11,086 --> 00:27:12,421
Don't.

299
00:27:20,329 --> 00:27:21,995
I'll call you tomorrow morning.

300
00:27:21,997 --> 00:27:24,263
Don't stay out too late.

301
00:27:24,265 --> 00:27:26,466
And if their lawyer calls,
you do not talk to him, okay?

302
00:27:26,468 --> 00:27:29,168
I mean it. Catherine, this is serious.

303
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,237
You know what? Maybe we shouldn't go.

304
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:33,706
What? No. Oh, my God, Dad, go.

305
00:27:33,708 --> 00:27:36,543
It's... I won't talk to anyone.

306
00:27:36,545 --> 00:27:37,980
I'll be with Mae.

307
00:27:39,982 --> 00:27:41,581
Iris.

308
00:27:41,583 --> 00:27:42,619
I'll be fine.

309
00:28:55,457 --> 00:28:56,790
Jesus.

310
00:28:56,792 --> 00:28:58,695
- Hi.
- Hi, Jack.

311
00:29:00,396 --> 00:29:01,696
How are you?

312
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:04,467
Uh, good. Good, good. Good.

313
00:29:05,633 --> 00:29:06,867
Have you seen Iris?

314
00:29:06,869 --> 00:29:08,534
Uh, Iris? Yeah, she just left.

315
00:29:08,536 --> 00:29:11,138
She went to have dinner
at her thesis advisor's.

316
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,738
Dinner? Oh.

317
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,741
Well, you know, she was
wearing a very small skirt,

318
00:29:14,743 --> 00:29:17,444
and she took a really long shower.

319
00:29:17,446 --> 00:29:20,247
Oh? Was it a suede skirt?

320
00:29:20,249 --> 00:29:21,581
Uh-huh.

321
00:29:21,583 --> 00:29:23,650
You know that's her "fuck me" skirt?

322
00:29:23,652 --> 00:29:25,418
Interesting.

323
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,989
Yeah.

324
00:29:28,957 --> 00:29:30,159
Um...

325
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:34,061
Is that your boyfriend?

326
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:37,230
Well, that's Che Guevara. And I'm not gay.

327
00:29:37,232 --> 00:29:40,837
And if I were, it wouldn't
be with a man in a beret.

328
00:29:41,503 --> 00:29:42,539
Nice.

329
00:29:44,006 --> 00:29:45,305
Uh...

330
00:29:45,307 --> 00:29:47,342
Sorry, uh, what are you doing now?

331
00:29:48,444 --> 00:29:50,977
I don't know.

332
00:29:50,979 --> 00:29:53,515
Um, it's nice seeing you.

333
00:29:55,918 --> 00:29:57,152
See you.

334
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,700
Hang on!

335
00:30:13,969 --> 00:30:15,369
- Hey.
- Hi.

336
00:30:15,371 --> 00:30:17,271
- How you doing?
- Good.

337
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:18,738
- Come on in.
- How are you?

338
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,008
- I'm good.
- Yeah?

339
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:23,580
Sorry it's so hot in here.

340
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,316
I'm sweating like a pig.

341
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:32,686
Um, ice cream.

342
00:30:32,688 --> 00:30:34,420
You're a gentleman.

343
00:30:34,422 --> 00:30:36,991
I mean, I get it for free,

344
00:30:36,993 --> 00:30:39,792
in the sense I just steal it from work.

345
00:30:39,794 --> 00:30:43,164
I hope you believe as I do that, as
Americans, we're obliged to consume

346
00:30:43,166 --> 00:30:47,600
mass amounts of unusable
carbohydrates that numb our brains

347
00:30:47,602 --> 00:30:51,105
and make us better television
watchers, 'cause I'm making pasta.

348
00:30:51,107 --> 00:30:52,539
Mmm.

349
00:30:52,541 --> 00:30:53,710
Food of my people.

350
00:30:55,076 --> 00:30:56,909
You look Irish.

351
00:30:56,911 --> 00:30:58,581
I also look innocent.

352
00:31:19,067 --> 00:31:20,300
What can I get you?

353
00:31:20,302 --> 00:31:22,034
- Can I have a vodka soda?
- Sure.

354
00:31:22,036 --> 00:31:24,705
And can I order something,
a drink for someone?

355
00:31:24,707 --> 00:31:26,173
Absolutely.

356
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,077
The guy with the blue hat.

357
00:31:29,244 --> 00:31:31,778
- Whatever he drinks.
- Okay.

358
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,782
Thanks.

359
00:31:35,484 --> 00:31:37,352
- Yo, Billy.
- Yeah?

360
00:31:52,334 --> 00:31:54,001
Just take it.

361
00:31:54,003 --> 00:31:56,936
All right, look, you need to leave.

362
00:31:56,938 --> 00:31:58,640
Can I just talk to you?

363
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:21,528
I don't even want to publish
another book, you know.

364
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:23,731
I mean, nobody needs some
white guy with poor vision

365
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,433
and an Ivy League degree
getting all the luck.

366
00:32:25,435 --> 00:32:27,868
Some kid in a rundown mobile
home might not have a chance.

367
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:30,003
I can't let that happen.

368
00:32:30,005 --> 00:32:32,775
So I'm just gonna stagnate.

369
00:32:36,111 --> 00:32:37,580
I loved your books.

370
00:32:38,714 --> 00:32:39,916
Yeah, thanks.

371
00:33:01,035 --> 00:33:03,305
No, no, no, I'm okay.

372
00:33:16,618 --> 00:33:18,717
So, you like the Polish poets?

373
00:33:18,719 --> 00:33:21,388
- Is that what your work is like?
- Yes.

374
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:26,760
The intersection of poetic
lyricism and existential darkness?

375
00:33:26,762 --> 00:33:27,730
Yes.

376
00:33:39,507 --> 00:33:41,009
What are you doing?

377
00:34:18,213 --> 00:34:19,512
Mmm, no.

378
00:34:19,514 --> 00:34:21,383
Yeah, good idea. Good idea.

379
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:25,921
Good idea.

380
00:34:32,227 --> 00:34:33,529
How old are you?

381
00:34:35,898 --> 00:34:36,932
Forty.

382
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,961
I'll be right back.

383
00:35:42,963 --> 00:35:45,164
- Okay.
- Okay?

384
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:46,802
Okay, just a sec.

385
00:36:03,718 --> 00:36:04,854
A-ha!

386
00:36:05,653 --> 00:36:06,688
Found you.

387
00:36:48,296 --> 00:36:49,265
Hi.

388
00:36:52,467 --> 00:36:53,436
Hi.

389
00:37:23,831 --> 00:37:24,799
Hey.

390
00:37:26,769 --> 00:37:28,070
Beauty.

391
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,923
Can I just say this? I don't...

392
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:25,694
I wish it were me instead of Mae. I...

393
00:38:27,329 --> 00:38:30,700
I can't sleep without dreaming of her.

394
00:38:32,534 --> 00:38:35,803
I don't deserve to be here. I wish I...

395
00:38:35,805 --> 00:38:42,408
I wish I could've swung the car
around so it were me instead of her.

396
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:45,345
You know I wasn't drunk. I
wasn't high. It just happened.

397
00:38:45,347 --> 00:38:46,912
It was just a bad turn.

398
00:38:46,914 --> 00:38:49,485
Hey, you know, my parents...

399
00:38:52,753 --> 00:38:56,057
My sister is gone.

400
00:38:57,325 --> 00:38:58,725
- I know.
- All right?

401
00:38:58,727 --> 00:39:02,495
There's no fucking changing it for them.

402
00:39:02,497 --> 00:39:07,133
You have your whole life to get over this.

403
00:39:07,135 --> 00:39:10,372
- I swear to God I won't...
- Now get fuck away from me, Catherine.

404
00:39:27,155 --> 00:39:29,624
Get the fuck away from me!

405
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:51,347
Stop. Stop. Stop.

406
00:40:15,671 --> 00:40:16,806
Come on.

407
00:42:35,142 --> 00:42:36,110
Hey.

408
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:53,962
Hello.

409
00:42:56,497 --> 00:42:57,532
Hi.

410
00:43:06,974 --> 00:43:08,776
- Iris.
- What?

411
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:23,459
I just like you.

412
00:43:25,693 --> 00:43:29,028
I like you, too. Okay?

413
00:43:35,936 --> 00:43:37,772
It feels good.

414
00:43:42,977 --> 00:43:45,648
You have to be quiet.

415
00:44:13,874 --> 00:44:14,909
Hey.

416
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:19,314
I have to tell you something, I...

417
00:44:20,881 --> 00:44:22,217
I just...

418
00:44:24,218 --> 00:44:25,653
I can't keep it from you.

419
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:32,091
You can tell me.

420
00:44:32,093 --> 00:44:35,063
I mean, you've been MIA,
so I know something's up.

421
00:44:39,034 --> 00:44:41,403
I'm seeing my thesis advisor.

422
00:44:43,303 --> 00:44:45,240
Seeing him?

423
00:44:46,907 --> 00:44:49,510
I slept with him. I'm sleeping with him.

424
00:44:50,579 --> 00:44:51,580
He's married.

425
00:44:53,648 --> 00:44:54,950
He's married?

426
00:44:56,351 --> 00:44:58,318
I mean, I know it's wrong.

427
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,923
It's wrong and it's bad, and
it's all of those things but...

428
00:45:08,162 --> 00:45:09,995
It doesn't seem it.

429
00:45:09,997 --> 00:45:15,267
It's shocking because
it's just not you at all.

430
00:45:15,269 --> 00:45:16,271
I know.

431
00:45:21,943 --> 00:45:23,144
How was it?

432
00:45:25,512 --> 00:45:29,183
It was unbelievable. I
mean, it is unbelievable.

433
00:45:29,885 --> 00:45:31,216
It's amazing.

434
00:45:33,555 --> 00:45:35,524
Maybe his wife's a bitch.

435
00:45:50,204 --> 00:45:52,473
I just want the best for you.

436
00:45:53,474 --> 00:45:55,475
You know?

437
00:45:55,477 --> 00:45:59,381
I know, inevitably, you're
going to get hurt here.

438
00:46:06,019 --> 00:46:07,588
I'm already hurt.

439
00:46:08,689 --> 00:46:10,224
It can't get worse.

440
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,928
I gotta shower.

441
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:17,099
I'm going over to his place later.

442
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,298
What's your plan?

443
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:22,401
I thought we were hanging out.

444
00:46:22,403 --> 00:46:24,836
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.

445
00:46:24,838 --> 00:46:28,508
It's gonna be our summer?

446
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:31,412
You and Professor Feely McGrabby?

447
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:33,879
And me and me?

448
00:46:33,881 --> 00:46:35,684
No. No.

449
00:47:05,747 --> 00:47:08,648
- So, were you in the hospital?
- What?

450
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:10,651
After the accident. Sorry, that was abrupt.

451
00:47:11,318 --> 00:47:12,852
Oh. Uh...

452
00:47:12,854 --> 00:47:14,056
It's okay.

453
00:47:16,189 --> 00:47:18,559
Uh, I had to have stitches, yeah.

454
00:47:19,561 --> 00:47:21,530
And, um, Catherine...

455
00:47:24,233 --> 00:47:27,901
They had her on suicide
watch for, like, a week.

456
00:47:27,903 --> 00:47:29,238
She tried to slit her wrists.

457
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:34,874
She was just, like, clawing at herself.

458
00:47:34,876 --> 00:47:37,178
So they had her sedated
through the funeral.

459
00:47:40,046 --> 00:47:44,418
And she, uh, severed a tendon
in her calf in the accident.

460
00:47:46,021 --> 00:47:47,522
So, how's she doing now?

461
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:51,093
I don't know.

462
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:53,361
She in therapy?

463
00:47:56,097 --> 00:47:58,366
No, she says she doesn't need it.

464
00:47:59,601 --> 00:48:01,035
How about you?

465
00:48:04,305 --> 00:48:06,240
I've been feeling better lately.

466
00:48:22,389 --> 00:48:23,391
Hi.

467
00:48:43,577 --> 00:48:45,980
Oh, you're so hard.

468
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:53,653
You know, that's just
like a throwaway line,

469
00:48:53,655 --> 00:48:55,921
but when you say it, I
know why it's a classic.

470
00:48:57,390 --> 00:48:58,693
Oh, my God.

471
00:49:00,327 --> 00:49:01,760
Oh. Oh!

472
00:49:01,762 --> 00:49:04,430
Babe, wait! You're
gonna make me come. Fuck!

473
00:49:04,432 --> 00:49:06,800
Jesus.

474
00:49:06,802 --> 00:49:08,637
That's another classic.

475
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:19,514
- Shh, shh.
- I won't shh.

476
00:49:25,352 --> 00:49:26,785
Are you like this with all the boys?

477
00:49:26,787 --> 00:49:28,086
I was a virgin.

478
00:49:28,088 --> 00:49:29,856
Yeah, I can tell.

479
00:49:29,858 --> 00:49:31,791
I'm actually not like this at all.

480
00:50:02,222 --> 00:50:03,655
- This way.
- Wait.

481
00:50:03,657 --> 00:50:05,725
- What?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop.

482
00:50:05,727 --> 00:50:07,392
What? What is that?

483
00:50:07,394 --> 00:50:08,995
Oh, please with the grabbing.

484
00:50:08,997 --> 00:50:11,263
I thought you said you're
not doing it anymore.

485
00:50:11,265 --> 00:50:13,099
I'm not.

486
00:50:15,336 --> 00:50:16,905
- No, I'm not.
- Guys!

487
00:50:17,838 --> 00:50:19,137
- To the pond.
- Yes.

488
00:50:19,139 --> 00:50:20,408
- It's gonna be beautiful!
- I know...

489
00:50:40,896 --> 00:50:42,930
Mmm, you have man hands.

490
00:50:44,131 --> 00:50:46,101
- That's what I ordered.
- Hmm.

491
00:50:49,970 --> 00:50:52,370
Hey, you want to meet my dad?

492
00:50:52,372 --> 00:50:54,307
I'm having lunch with
him on campus tomorrow.

493
00:50:54,309 --> 00:50:56,408
I thought I could bring him by.

494
00:50:56,410 --> 00:50:59,778
"Father, you remember how I told you

495
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:02,613
"that I'm not a little girl anymore?"

496
00:51:02,615 --> 00:51:04,452
He's a nice guy.

497
00:51:10,691 --> 00:51:12,793
I'm not your boyfriend.

498
00:51:15,664 --> 00:51:18,900
A, it's been two weeks.

499
00:51:20,034 --> 00:51:22,403
B, I'm not your boyfriend.

500
00:51:23,704 --> 00:51:26,140
C, I'm a dirty, old man.

501
00:51:26,974 --> 00:51:28,075
And,

502
00:51:29,077 --> 00:51:31,079
D, my wife's coming up.

503
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:44,923
She's gonna be here all weekend.
She comes up every weekend.

504
00:51:44,925 --> 00:51:47,461
Except the last three because of work.

505
00:51:48,695 --> 00:51:50,729
Fun.

506
00:51:50,731 --> 00:51:52,731
It's gonna be fun for all of us.

507
00:51:54,802 --> 00:51:56,170
Just a minute!

508
00:51:57,137 --> 00:51:58,172
Iris.

509
00:52:00,775 --> 00:52:02,941
I'm so fucked!

510
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:05,477
There's this tool from Brown who's
had my book from interlibrary loan

511
00:52:05,479 --> 00:52:06,912
for three weeks.

512
00:52:06,914 --> 00:52:08,914
I think he's dead in his thesis carrel,

513
00:52:08,916 --> 00:52:10,485
the book under his decaying
ass, and I'll never get it back.

514
00:52:15,756 --> 00:52:17,359
Glad to see you.

515
00:52:18,925 --> 00:52:20,727
As heard.

516
00:52:20,729 --> 00:52:23,365
Gerald's wife is coming up this weekend.

517
00:52:26,133 --> 00:52:27,636
I'm an asshole.

518
00:52:29,702 --> 00:52:31,172
You're an asshole.

519
00:52:37,878 --> 00:52:40,481
It's only been, like, two weeks, but still.

520
00:52:41,883 --> 00:52:43,585
How long has he been married?

521
00:52:45,586 --> 00:52:47,621
We don't talk about it.

522
00:52:48,923 --> 00:52:50,823
It's not funny, Catherine.

523
00:52:50,825 --> 00:52:53,291
Let's just smoke weed all weekend.

524
00:52:53,293 --> 00:52:54,760
Okay. Do you have any?

525
00:52:54,762 --> 00:52:58,430
No, but I'm sure Jack does.

526
00:52:58,432 --> 00:53:00,899
I haven't spoken to him in, like, a week.

527
00:53:00,901 --> 00:53:04,202
Been staying at Professor FuckBuddy's.

528
00:53:04,204 --> 00:53:05,905
You look really skinny.

529
00:53:05,907 --> 00:53:08,874
Like, coke-skinny or meth?

530
00:53:08,876 --> 00:53:11,242
Those are my two choices?

531
00:53:11,244 --> 00:53:12,845
Boo!

532
00:53:12,847 --> 00:53:15,381
Just get me some weed.
I need to get my grub on.

533
00:53:15,383 --> 00:53:18,816
Why don't you just come in? It's gorgeous!

534
00:53:18,818 --> 00:53:20,952
No, I can't swim in this.

535
00:53:20,954 --> 00:53:22,489
Fuck if I care. Take it off.

536
00:53:24,791 --> 00:53:27,792
Do you care what I've been up to at all

537
00:53:27,794 --> 00:53:31,930
while you've been sleeping
with Professor Von Slurpy?

538
00:53:31,932 --> 00:53:34,101
Yeah. What?

539
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:38,607
Professional escort work.

540
00:53:41,041 --> 00:53:43,978
I had a G-spot orgasm from being on top.

541
00:53:45,111 --> 00:53:46,345
Nice.

542
00:53:46,347 --> 00:53:47,847
Did you pee?

543
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:49,048
Just now?

544
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:51,850
No. When you came, hello?

545
00:53:51,852 --> 00:53:55,354
You know, sometimes
women, when they ejaculate,

546
00:53:55,356 --> 00:53:57,388
they think it's urine, but it's really not.

547
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:58,658
It's just love potion.

548
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:01,093
I don't know.

549
00:54:01,095 --> 00:54:03,863
I mean, I get, like, really wet,

550
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:06,298
but it's not like a burst or anything.

551
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,800
Oh, my God, you're, like, all sexed up.

552
00:54:08,802 --> 00:54:11,272
- It's insane. It's like you're possessed.
- Hmm.

553
00:54:12,139 --> 00:54:14,539
Possessed by Mae.

554
00:54:14,541 --> 00:54:16,975
One of us has gotta be the slut, right?

555
00:54:16,977 --> 00:54:19,914
Well, you're in lurve, so
it's not actually slutty.

556
00:54:25,352 --> 00:54:29,323
Is it good with Professor Von Slurpy?

557
00:54:30,356 --> 00:54:31,325
Yeah.

558
00:54:32,392 --> 00:54:33,360
Good.

559
00:54:35,729 --> 00:54:36,963
Come on, get in.

560
00:54:36,965 --> 00:54:39,934
No, I'm just gonna warm my soul.

561
00:54:41,936 --> 00:54:43,704
Ah, you're never coming in.

562
00:55:44,865 --> 00:55:46,601
- Yo!
- Hey.

563
00:55:47,468 --> 00:55:49,135
How was your sleep?

564
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:50,702
- Fine.
- Yeah?

565
00:55:50,704 --> 00:55:52,706
- Yeah.
- I have the paper.

566
00:55:53,541 --> 00:55:55,006
Oh!

567
00:55:55,008 --> 00:55:56,910
Look at all these tag sales.

568
00:55:57,611 --> 00:55:58,644
Let's go.

569
00:55:58,646 --> 00:56:00,414
Look what I've got.

570
00:56:02,784 --> 00:56:04,651
Really? Like, right here, right now?

571
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,986
Car pass. I don't want...

572
00:56:07,988 --> 00:56:10,756
Come on, Iris.

573
00:56:10,758 --> 00:56:12,925
'Cause I'm missing

574
00:56:12,927 --> 00:56:15,130
more than just your body.

575
00:56:17,932 --> 00:56:19,999
They eat the whole thing.

576
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:22,300
Shit.

577
00:56:22,302 --> 00:56:24,303
Henry? Wait, who'd you kiss?

578
00:56:24,305 --> 00:56:26,338
Yeah, that was, like, my
first spot for make-out.

579
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:28,340
Well, my first kiss.

580
00:56:28,342 --> 00:56:29,642
Oh, my God, so you're talking,
like, peck on the cheek.

581
00:56:34,916 --> 00:56:36,618
I'm getting so high.

582
00:56:39,787 --> 00:56:41,289
Perfect.

583
00:56:49,028 --> 00:56:50,629
God, Iris, come here.

584
00:56:50,631 --> 00:56:52,296
No.

585
00:56:52,298 --> 00:56:53,698
Oh, my God.

586
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:56,334
I'm so sexually confused.

587
00:56:56,336 --> 00:57:00,071
- How much for this record?
- 20.

588
00:57:00,073 --> 00:57:01,840
- Too much, it's like...
- 15?

589
00:57:01,842 --> 00:57:03,508
Deal.

590
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:05,376
This belongs to us now.

591
00:57:05,378 --> 00:57:08,079
This would make me throb.

592
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:13,586
20th century Psoriasis...

593
00:57:13,588 --> 00:57:15,657
Sounds like something my dad would say.

594
00:57:17,992 --> 00:57:19,260
It's got a distinct aroma.

595
00:57:24,064 --> 00:57:26,398
Iris, this is my grandma, 1970s.

596
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,867
It's fucking freaky.

597
00:57:28,869 --> 00:57:31,769
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

598
00:57:31,771 --> 00:57:32,907
That's Von Slurpy.

599
00:57:33,706 --> 00:57:35,207
What?

600
00:57:35,209 --> 00:57:36,511
Yeah, and missus.

601
00:57:41,081 --> 00:57:43,684
- Oh, my God. He's old.
- Let's go.

602
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:54,593
Hey.

603
00:57:54,595 --> 00:57:55,660
Iris, hey.

604
00:57:55,662 --> 00:57:56,729
- Hi.
- Hey.

605
00:57:56,731 --> 00:57:58,564
- Hi. Good.
- How are you?

606
00:57:58,566 --> 00:57:59,965
Uh, Lisette, this is Iris.

607
00:57:59,967 --> 00:58:02,233
She's one of my students.

608
00:58:02,235 --> 00:58:04,505
I'm advising her on her thesis.

609
00:58:06,474 --> 00:58:08,907
- Catherine. Hi.
- Hi.

610
00:58:08,909 --> 00:58:10,778
Hey, nice to meet you.

611
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:15,881
They, uh, grew up in
Ansbury, just right near here.

612
00:58:15,883 --> 00:58:18,316
Oh! Just such a wonderful place
to grow up. It's so beautiful.

613
00:58:18,318 --> 00:58:20,151
Yeah, it is.

614
00:58:20,153 --> 00:58:21,620
Gerald's a really great professor.

615
00:58:23,956 --> 00:58:25,957
You know, he's also a really good bowler.

616
00:58:25,959 --> 00:58:28,093
Uh... Stop.

617
00:58:28,095 --> 00:58:30,128
Where...

618
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:32,497
I was looking for one of those
toasters that pop up, you know.

619
00:58:32,499 --> 00:58:34,432
Really?

620
00:58:34,434 --> 00:58:37,769
Yeah, you know, the timer things.

621
00:58:37,771 --> 00:58:39,838
I just gonna go look over
here and see if one's there.

622
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:42,140
- Good to see you guys.
- Bye.

623
00:58:42,142 --> 00:58:44,242
Wow. I'm, like, really thirsty right now.

624
00:58:44,244 --> 00:58:45,410
Yeah, me, too.

625
00:58:45,412 --> 00:58:47,546
I know, it's hot as balls.

626
00:58:47,548 --> 00:58:49,213
Gerald was saying something
about the smog layer

627
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:51,582
preventing the heat from escaping.

628
00:58:51,584 --> 00:58:54,084
That's fucked up.

629
00:58:54,086 --> 00:58:56,090
I'm dying to check out her linens.

630
00:58:57,825 --> 00:58:59,358
A box over there. It's
nice to meet you guys.

631
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:00,894
Nice to meet you.

632
00:59:03,131 --> 00:59:04,365
I have to go over there.

633
00:59:20,113 --> 00:59:23,115
This is a hideously small town.

634
00:59:23,117 --> 00:59:24,218
Mmm.

635
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:30,390
- You want a blowjob in the barn?
- That's not funny.

636
00:59:31,559 --> 00:59:32,727
It's a little funny.

637
00:59:35,329 --> 00:59:36,698
Hey, Gerald!

638
00:59:42,736 --> 00:59:45,970
- Hey, Catherine, we should go!
- Otherwise, we're gonna be...

639
00:59:45,972 --> 00:59:48,874
- Yeah, we're gonna be late for church!
- Yeah.

640
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:50,041
Bye. Nice to meet you.

641
00:59:50,043 --> 00:59:51,245
- Bye.
- See you.

642
00:59:52,579 --> 00:59:55,148
- That was insane.
- I'm insane.

643
00:59:57,651 --> 00:59:59,316
Fuck, our record.

644
00:59:59,318 --> 01:00:00,554
Come on. Let's go.

645
01:01:09,189 --> 01:01:11,224
I feel dirty and naughty.

646
01:01:12,492 --> 01:01:14,161
In a bad way.

647
01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:18,562
Our relationship lives in a dark closet.

648
01:01:18,564 --> 01:01:20,568
It's like a poison mushroom.

649
01:01:23,503 --> 01:01:24,572
I'm sorry.

650
01:01:27,008 --> 01:01:29,110
Why can't we go out around here?

651
01:01:33,414 --> 01:01:35,082
In a non-touchy way?

652
01:01:42,289 --> 01:01:44,155
Are you 21?

653
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,292
Yeah.

654
01:01:56,436 --> 01:01:57,572
Shit!

655
01:01:59,606 --> 01:02:02,207
Hey, are you in line?

656
01:02:21,561 --> 01:02:22,630
Excuse me.

657
01:02:48,689 --> 01:02:51,055
Excuse me. I'm going.

658
01:02:51,057 --> 01:02:52,126
What?

659
01:02:55,494 --> 01:02:56,662
Wait! Iris!

660
01:02:56,664 --> 01:03:00,097
- No. No.
- Stop. Stop.

661
01:03:00,099 --> 01:03:03,901
- What are you doing with him?
- I don't know.

662
01:03:03,903 --> 01:03:06,171
Why would you be with
someone that hates you?

663
01:03:06,173 --> 01:03:07,773
It's fucked up!

664
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:09,443
And you're so happy with me?

665
01:03:11,544 --> 01:03:13,812
You make it worse!

666
01:03:13,814 --> 01:03:16,948
- Why would you say that?
- Hey, what are you doing?

667
01:03:16,950 --> 01:03:19,416
I'm doing exactly what you're doing, Iris.

668
01:03:19,418 --> 01:03:21,820
Not knowing what the fuck I'm doing!

669
01:03:21,822 --> 01:03:23,858
- Okay.
- Mmm-hmm.

670
01:03:26,193 --> 01:03:28,496
At least I know it's not love.

671
01:03:40,073 --> 01:03:41,673
Are you all right?

672
01:03:41,675 --> 01:03:43,010
What's going on?

673
01:03:48,816 --> 01:03:49,851
Let's just go.

674
01:04:39,265 --> 01:04:41,066
<i>I told him I love him.</i>

675
01:04:41,068 --> 01:04:42,466
- What? What?
- What?

676
01:04:42,468 --> 01:04:43,736
What did he say?

677
01:04:43,738 --> 01:04:46,470
It was so fucking beautiful.

678
01:04:46,472 --> 01:04:50,140
He said, "I love you"
back and it's so insane.

679
01:04:50,142 --> 01:04:53,113
Don't worry. I love you, too.

680
01:05:02,356 --> 01:05:04,792
Hey, we need to get out of the car, guys.

681
01:05:06,892 --> 01:05:08,228
Where's Mae?

682
01:05:09,463 --> 01:05:10,898
We got blood everywhere.

683
01:05:29,650 --> 01:05:32,651
Come on. We have to go. Come on.

684
01:05:32,653 --> 01:05:34,486
- No.
- Come on, come on.

685
01:05:34,488 --> 01:05:36,421
We have to go, come on.

686
01:05:36,423 --> 01:05:37,490
Come on.

687
01:05:42,262 --> 01:05:43,963
Come on.

688
01:05:43,965 --> 01:05:47,131
I thought you were...

689
01:05:47,133 --> 01:05:50,671
I got you. I've got you, I've
got you. Come on. Come on.

690
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:57,709
Stop.

691
01:05:57,711 --> 01:05:59,843
Stop! Stop! Stop!

692
01:05:59,845 --> 01:06:01,178
Stop!

693
01:06:06,186 --> 01:06:08,019
Oh, my God.

694
01:06:08,021 --> 01:06:09,222
Oh, my God.

695
01:06:10,356 --> 01:06:11,856
Oh, my God.

696
01:06:11,858 --> 01:06:13,561
I was just driving.

697
01:06:15,729 --> 01:06:17,098
It was nothing.

698
01:06:21,434 --> 01:06:26,040
I just flicked the cigarette out my
window, and it just got away from me.

699
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:28,441
I'm sorry.

700
01:06:32,211 --> 01:06:33,514
I'm sorry.

701
01:06:36,715 --> 01:06:37,717
Mmm.

702
01:06:39,986 --> 01:06:41,385
I'm sorry.

703
01:06:41,387 --> 01:06:42,523
Hey, hey.

704
01:07:19,825 --> 01:07:22,228
It's Sunday, we don't have
to be talking on the phone.

705
01:07:24,197 --> 01:07:25,198
Hello.

706
01:07:26,967 --> 01:07:28,535
It's the lawyer, Dan.

707
01:07:33,374 --> 01:07:35,006
Are you cold?

708
01:07:35,008 --> 01:07:36,274
What?

709
01:07:36,276 --> 01:07:37,278
Are you cold?

710
01:07:37,945 --> 01:07:38,946
No.

711
01:07:42,715 --> 01:07:44,115
Iris!

712
01:07:44,117 --> 01:07:45,119
Shit!

713
01:07:45,952 --> 01:07:47,720
Shit. Shit.

714
01:07:48,988 --> 01:07:49,956
Iris?

715
01:07:51,390 --> 01:07:53,325
Jesus, Catherine!

716
01:07:53,327 --> 01:07:58,329
They're filing a civil suit. Mae's parents.

717
01:07:58,331 --> 01:08:00,367
They're suing me for wrongful death.

718
01:08:03,470 --> 01:08:05,238
Can they do that?

719
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,141
Yeah.

720
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:17,181
Hey, Lon, do you have
Harvey Faulkner's cell phone?

721
01:08:17,183 --> 01:08:18,882
One of my students is in legal trouble and

722
01:08:18,884 --> 01:08:20,552
I wanted her to talk to
him as soon as possible.

723
01:08:20,554 --> 01:08:22,119
Can you give me a call?

724
01:08:22,121 --> 01:08:23,124
All right.

725
01:08:24,022 --> 01:08:25,659
My lawyer is fine.

726
01:08:32,866 --> 01:08:35,100
He has a certain...

727
01:08:35,102 --> 01:08:37,836
They can't prove you did anything wrong.

728
01:08:37,838 --> 01:08:40,441
- I didn't.
- No, you didn't.

729
01:08:49,448 --> 01:08:51,349
They say Catherine recently confessed

730
01:08:51,351 --> 01:08:53,351
to averting her eyes from the road

731
01:08:53,353 --> 01:08:55,285
to toss a cigarette out the window,

732
01:08:55,287 --> 01:08:58,122
and that after that she
lost control of the car.

733
01:08:58,124 --> 01:09:01,493
That moment, hands leaving the wheel,

734
01:09:01,495 --> 01:09:04,694
that constitutes a failure
to pay attention to the road.

735
01:09:04,696 --> 01:09:06,263
That's negligence.

736
01:09:06,265 --> 01:09:08,399
Jesus, Catherine!

737
01:09:08,401 --> 01:09:10,037
You told someone that?

738
01:09:24,349 --> 01:09:25,385
Billy!

739
01:09:30,490 --> 01:09:32,358
Billy, please open up.

740
01:09:50,576 --> 01:09:52,743
You wanna talk about it?

741
01:09:52,745 --> 01:09:55,680
There's nothing to talk
about. What do you mean?

742
01:09:55,682 --> 01:09:57,582
Isn't this why we're here?

743
01:09:57,584 --> 01:09:59,253
So you can be out of the city,

744
01:10:00,853 --> 01:10:03,521
and watch the bra-less
coeds skip across the lawn

745
01:10:03,523 --> 01:10:07,792
and feel the stirrings of youth again.

746
01:10:07,794 --> 01:10:12,329
And if it isn't working, I just wonder
if there's something else going on.

747
01:10:12,331 --> 01:10:15,867
There's nothing going on. I am writing.

748
01:10:15,869 --> 01:10:18,035
How's the Navajo project?

749
01:10:18,037 --> 01:10:21,038
What was the upshot with Cy?

750
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:24,307
He said it needed revisions. It
wasn't extreme enough for fiction.

751
01:10:24,309 --> 01:10:26,578
- Oh, no.
- No, he was right.

752
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:28,712
That's insane.

753
01:10:28,714 --> 01:10:32,550
I really thought that the pivot
that you made was totally brilliant.

754
01:10:32,552 --> 01:10:34,455
So, wait, you are writing?

755
01:10:35,522 --> 01:10:36,590
Yeah.

756
01:10:37,756 --> 01:10:38,925
- So...
- Wow.

757
01:10:39,893 --> 01:10:40,928
Can I read it?

758
01:10:42,295 --> 01:10:43,430
No.

759
01:10:48,902 --> 01:10:50,671
Why do you need to read it?

760
01:10:51,737 --> 01:10:53,538
Because I like your work?

761
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:54,808
No, you don't.

762
01:10:57,544 --> 01:11:01,645
I don't like your work? I love your work.

763
01:11:01,647 --> 01:11:04,815
No, you don't. You don't
believe I have anything to say.

764
01:11:04,817 --> 01:11:06,751
Anyway, that's not the
reason why you can't read it.

765
01:11:06,753 --> 01:11:10,157
You can't read it 'cause it's
too new. It's too fragile.

766
01:11:12,192 --> 01:11:13,260
"Fragile."

767
01:11:15,461 --> 01:11:17,863
Like a Faberge egg fragile?

768
01:11:17,865 --> 01:11:19,465
Yeah.

769
01:11:22,869 --> 01:11:25,072
There's ice cream places open.

770
01:11:26,272 --> 01:11:28,773
I can't.

771
01:11:28,775 --> 01:11:31,411
You want me to go out?
I'll get some and come back.

772
01:11:31,945 --> 01:11:32,979
Okay.

773
01:11:33,946 --> 01:11:35,315
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

774
01:12:37,678 --> 01:12:40,345
Just stay. You just got here.
You can't even stay the night?

775
01:12:40,347 --> 01:12:42,279
Since we're starting at 9:00,

776
01:12:42,281 --> 01:12:44,416
I don't want to get up at
6:00 and drive for three hours.

777
01:12:44,418 --> 01:12:46,516
What, you can't say,
"I'd give you Saturday,

778
01:12:46,518 --> 01:12:48,921
"but you'll never take my Sundays"?

779
01:12:50,689 --> 01:12:52,759
The summer isn't really going as planned.

780
01:12:54,827 --> 01:12:55,862
No.

781
01:12:59,765 --> 01:13:01,599
I gotta go.

782
01:13:01,601 --> 01:13:02,603
Hey.

783
01:13:06,705 --> 01:13:08,275
Drive carefully.

784
01:13:40,339 --> 01:13:42,340
Billy! Hey.

785
01:13:42,342 --> 01:13:45,609
- One second.
- What are you doing?

786
01:13:45,611 --> 01:13:48,712
Why would you make it seem like
she confessed something to you?

787
01:13:48,714 --> 01:13:50,148
She didn't. You took it out of context.

788
01:13:50,150 --> 01:13:51,949
- Iris.
- No, it's not fair.

789
01:13:51,951 --> 01:13:54,318
You know...

790
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:58,989
Taking money from her parents is
not going to make this hurt less.

791
01:13:58,991 --> 01:14:00,624
It's not going to make it any better.

792
01:14:00,626 --> 01:14:03,227
- Yeah, it will. Yeah, it will.
- No, it won't!

793
01:14:03,229 --> 01:14:04,964
- It won't.
- Hey. One sec, Pa.

794
01:14:06,665 --> 01:14:09,566
Hey, you know, we still have
to, like, wake up every day

795
01:14:09,568 --> 01:14:12,236
and go to work like we're normal.

796
01:14:12,238 --> 01:14:13,971
No one expects you to be normal.

797
01:14:13,973 --> 01:14:16,507
You think I can just, like,
sit at home and cry all day?

798
01:14:16,509 --> 01:14:19,543
Iris, wake up.

799
01:14:19,545 --> 01:14:22,950
- It won't make it right.
- Oh, it's never going to be right, Iris.

800
01:14:24,817 --> 01:14:26,320
I'm not an idiot.

801
01:14:39,732 --> 01:14:42,234
I need to talk to her.

802
01:14:42,236 --> 01:14:45,235
Don't you think she
needs to talk to someone?

803
01:14:45,237 --> 01:14:49,640
<i>You girls should not be talking
until after the trial. Goodbye.</i>

804
01:15:26,112 --> 01:15:27,581
You're incredible.

805
01:15:30,482 --> 01:15:32,151
These are wonderful.

806
01:16:11,957 --> 01:16:13,059
I think...

807
01:16:16,228 --> 01:16:19,297
I'm not what you need.

808
01:16:19,299 --> 01:16:22,302
I think I know more about
what I need than you do.

809
01:16:32,344 --> 01:16:33,479
I love you.

810
01:16:44,389 --> 01:16:46,425
Do you know what this is?

811
01:16:49,528 --> 01:16:51,596
I don't.

812
01:16:51,598 --> 01:16:55,102
This is the moment right
before everything falls apart.

813
01:16:56,602 --> 01:16:58,802
I love you, but that doesn't matter.

814
01:16:58,804 --> 01:17:01,472
It's not Catherine's fault that
Mae died, but that doesn't matter.

815
01:17:01,474 --> 01:17:04,475
This is how it works.
Everything falls apart.

816
01:17:04,477 --> 01:17:07,177
And you just have to keep
walking and try not to fall down.

817
01:17:07,179 --> 01:17:09,883
- For as long as possible.
- Mmm-hmm. Don't say that.

818
01:17:12,184 --> 01:17:13,352
That's not it.

819
01:17:23,295 --> 01:17:24,664
I should go.

820
01:17:26,799 --> 01:17:29,635
You should be inside me and never leave.

821
01:17:31,970 --> 01:17:33,139
Whatever.

822
01:17:38,443 --> 01:17:41,279
I have hash and it's the
Little League final of Newburgh!

823
01:17:41,281 --> 01:17:42,480
Are you ready to weep...

824
01:17:42,482 --> 01:17:44,448
Sorry.

825
01:17:44,450 --> 01:17:45,452
Professor McCann?

826
01:17:46,986 --> 01:17:48,388
- Hi.
- Hi.

827
01:17:49,622 --> 01:17:50,857
Um, I should get going.

828
01:17:52,525 --> 01:17:54,193
Thank you.

829
01:18:14,513 --> 01:18:16,615
What are you doing?

830
01:18:18,084 --> 01:18:19,251
I have

831
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:21,788
brown nipples.

832
01:18:26,093 --> 01:18:30,597
You left that poem about
that stoned toddler...

833
01:18:32,165 --> 01:18:33,900
You left it in a drawer.

834
01:18:36,201 --> 01:18:37,603
What are you doing?

835
01:18:40,071 --> 01:18:41,540
How do you mean?

836
01:18:55,588 --> 01:18:56,790
I don't know.

837
01:18:59,959 --> 01:19:02,129
What I'm doing.

838
01:19:04,363 --> 01:19:06,332
You know it's not about you.

839
01:19:09,634 --> 01:19:13,537
I hope you understand it's
not about you, Gerald McCann.

840
01:19:13,539 --> 01:19:17,874
For her. Tell me you
understand that on some level.

841
01:19:17,876 --> 01:19:21,145
She's experiencing a crisis
based on actual life and death,

842
01:19:21,147 --> 01:19:24,648
and you give her your dick as a present?

843
01:19:24,650 --> 01:19:27,754
Did you think it had
magical healing powers?

844
01:19:30,522 --> 01:19:31,724
It doesn't.

845
01:19:39,031 --> 01:19:40,564
Shit.

846
01:19:40,566 --> 01:19:41,601
Shit.

847
01:19:42,468 --> 01:19:43,470
Shit.

848
01:20:12,531 --> 01:20:14,567
You used to be original.

849
01:20:28,682 --> 01:20:29,715
I know.

850
01:20:35,655 --> 01:20:37,122
I fucking know.

851
01:21:29,842 --> 01:21:32,612
Uh, she found a poem
that I wrote about you.

852
01:21:33,545 --> 01:21:35,178
Oh...

853
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:37,314
And she came up last night.

854
01:21:37,316 --> 01:21:39,885
- What did she...
- She went back to the city.

855
01:21:45,657 --> 01:21:47,059
Can I read it?

856
01:21:48,561 --> 01:21:49,795
Yeah.

857
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:59,102
So, I'm going to take this
next semester to go up to Maine.

858
01:21:59,104 --> 01:22:03,309
My parents are moving out of our old
house and they wanted my help, so...

859
01:22:05,745 --> 01:22:09,782
And I need to regroup.

860
01:22:12,151 --> 01:22:13,586
'Cause of me?

861
01:22:17,255 --> 01:22:18,657
Because of me.

862
01:22:24,496 --> 01:22:26,765
I'd do it again in a second.

863
01:22:29,835 --> 01:22:32,336
I mean, not if it made it worse for you.

864
01:22:32,338 --> 01:22:35,275
I really hope I didn't
make it worse for you.

865
01:22:39,245 --> 01:22:43,547
Look, it's preposterous
for me to be offering you

866
01:22:43,549 --> 01:22:46,149
any kind of life advice, clearly.

867
01:22:46,151 --> 01:22:47,320
Clearly.

868
01:22:49,088 --> 01:22:50,189
But

869
01:22:51,456 --> 01:22:53,224
I know this.

870
01:22:53,226 --> 01:22:57,160
And this is a kind of prescription.

871
01:22:57,162 --> 01:22:59,931
Okay, and it works.

872
01:22:59,933 --> 01:23:04,168
Um, these people wrote their
way out of where you are now.

873
01:23:04,170 --> 01:23:05,672
They came here first.

874
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:09,175
They figured it out.

875
01:23:10,442 --> 01:23:11,643
Um...

876
01:23:13,478 --> 01:23:17,082
So, Frost, Yeats, Dylan Thomas. Everything.

877
01:23:18,884 --> 01:23:22,886
Adam Zagajewski, "Praise
the mutilated world."

878
01:23:22,888 --> 01:23:29,060
Dickinson, "I measure every grief
I meet with narrow, probing eyes.

879
01:23:29,062 --> 01:23:33,233
"I wonder if it weighs like
mine, or has an easier size."

880
01:23:36,669 --> 01:23:39,005
Anyway, there's lots of others.

881
01:23:40,505 --> 01:23:42,541
You can hang onto that.

882
01:23:45,477 --> 01:23:46,912
And then, um...

883
01:23:48,281 --> 01:23:50,250
Send me what you write.

884
01:23:52,284 --> 01:23:54,219
And I'll do the same.

885
01:23:57,857 --> 01:23:58,925
Okay?

886
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:03,429
Okay.

887
01:24:49,674 --> 01:24:54,677
They waited on the side of the
road for emergency services.

888
01:24:54,679 --> 01:24:56,747
They did not have phones,

889
01:24:56,749 --> 01:25:00,987
and they couldn't walk due to
their injuries, so they just waited.

890
01:25:02,522 --> 01:25:05,457
We know they waited for over an hour.

891
01:25:32,619 --> 01:25:35,188
Catherine, could you hand me the eggs?

892
01:25:41,494 --> 01:25:44,764
Catherine, will you hand
me some eggs, please?

893
01:26:07,286 --> 01:26:09,289
Jesus!

894
01:26:09,955 --> 01:26:11,087
Fuck!

895
01:26:11,089 --> 01:26:12,057
Jesus.

896
01:26:17,229 --> 01:26:19,963
What the fuck?

897
01:26:19,965 --> 01:26:22,032
I don't even know my own strength.

898
01:26:22,034 --> 01:26:23,467
Ha!

899
01:26:23,469 --> 01:26:25,772
Yeah, it's fucking hilarious.

900
01:26:26,406 --> 01:26:27,573
Stay there.

901
01:26:45,290 --> 01:26:48,359
Why do you look like misery?

902
01:26:48,361 --> 01:26:50,727
When there's so much to be happy about?

903
01:26:54,532 --> 01:26:56,535
It's over with Gerald.

904
01:26:58,170 --> 01:26:59,939
His wife found out.

905
01:27:02,008 --> 01:27:04,041
Did she walk in on you?

906
01:27:04,043 --> 01:27:06,946
No. But she knows it's me.

907
01:27:15,487 --> 01:27:17,423
Are you in love with him?

908
01:27:41,045 --> 01:27:42,514
I don't know.

909
01:27:53,259 --> 01:27:54,827
I couldn't...

910
01:27:56,528 --> 01:27:58,497
I couldn't even touch her.

911
01:28:01,433 --> 01:28:03,835
She was already gone, Catherine.

912
01:28:08,372 --> 01:28:10,576
I should have been with her.

913
01:28:13,045 --> 01:28:14,347
I should have...

914
01:28:15,714 --> 01:28:17,617
I should have stayed.

915
01:28:36,034 --> 01:28:39,203
I'm so sorry about your love.

916
01:28:39,205 --> 01:28:40,770
Where are you going?

917
01:28:40,772 --> 01:28:44,940
Just wanted to say that
we should go out tomorrow.

918
01:28:44,942 --> 01:28:46,044
Don't leave.

919
01:28:48,213 --> 01:28:51,351
It's the night before my Judgment Day.

920
01:28:53,085 --> 01:28:55,288
Let's live while we can.

921
01:28:56,254 --> 01:28:57,356
Catherine.

922
01:29:17,142 --> 01:29:18,641
Fuck off!

923
01:29:18,643 --> 01:29:20,443
What the fuck?

924
01:29:20,445 --> 01:29:23,180
The only true compass to
the morass of American life

925
01:29:23,182 --> 01:29:26,385
is to trust your own
personal set of ethics.

926
01:29:28,086 --> 01:29:29,688
He doesn't want to see you.

927
01:29:34,259 --> 01:29:36,693
- Hey.
- What?

928
01:29:36,695 --> 01:29:38,296
Bartender wants you.

929
01:29:44,902 --> 01:29:45,972
Stop!

930
01:29:49,442 --> 01:29:50,907
Yeah?

931
01:29:50,909 --> 01:29:52,810
We need for you and your friend to leave.

932
01:29:52,812 --> 01:29:54,477
Why? We didn't do anything wrong.

933
01:29:54,479 --> 01:29:56,012
Why? Because I have obligations

934
01:29:56,014 --> 01:29:58,418
to certain customers here, that's why.

935
01:29:59,985 --> 01:30:01,353
Oh, obligations?

936
01:30:02,821 --> 01:30:04,154
Okay.

937
01:30:04,156 --> 01:30:05,792
Nope. No.

938
01:30:06,991 --> 01:30:08,093
Billy?

939
01:30:09,228 --> 01:30:10,726
Listen, man. Uh-uh.

940
01:30:10,728 --> 01:30:12,662
Let me just speak to Billy for a second!

941
01:30:12,664 --> 01:30:14,663
Hey, what's going on?

942
01:30:14,665 --> 01:30:17,667
They want us to leave. Billy
has told them to make us leave.

943
01:30:17,669 --> 01:30:19,270
- And that's not okay.
- No.

944
01:30:19,272 --> 01:30:21,070
- Let's just leave, that's fine.
- No.

945
01:30:21,072 --> 01:30:22,238
- Whoa, Iris, come on.
- No.

946
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:23,640
Iris, get down!

947
01:30:23,642 --> 01:30:25,042
- No, come on! Iris! Iris!
- Get off my bar.

948
01:30:25,044 --> 01:30:26,642
Billy, look at me!

949
01:30:26,644 --> 01:30:27,977
Iris, get down!

950
01:30:27,979 --> 01:30:29,879
Fucking look at me!

951
01:30:29,881 --> 01:30:31,815
- Fuck you!
- Iris, hey, stop!

952
01:30:31,817 --> 01:30:35,718
Why aren't we just allowed to be here?

953
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:39,221
Everyone else is allowed to be here!

954
01:30:39,223 --> 01:30:40,992
Explain it to me!

955
01:30:41,594 --> 01:30:43,060
Please!

956
01:30:43,062 --> 01:30:45,494
Please tell me why!

957
01:30:45,496 --> 01:30:47,329
I...

958
01:30:47,331 --> 01:30:49,535
It's not fucking fair!

959
01:30:51,336 --> 01:30:53,604
Let go of her!

960
01:30:53,606 --> 01:30:54,971
- Get off!
- Off my bar!

961
01:30:58,477 --> 01:30:59,943
You're hurting me!

962
01:30:59,945 --> 01:31:02,378
Fucking hurt... Ow!

963
01:32:01,673 --> 01:32:03,175
Are you okay, Iris?

964
01:32:03,942 --> 01:32:05,175
Yeah.

965
01:32:05,177 --> 01:32:06,843
We can take it slowly.

966
01:32:06,845 --> 01:32:10,182
- I'm okay.
- We're almost there.

967
01:33:12,544 --> 01:33:14,479
Wow, it's really warm.

968
01:33:17,182 --> 01:33:18,150
Hey.

969
01:33:20,619 --> 01:33:21,653
Hey.

970
01:33:25,223 --> 01:33:26,659
I just...

971
01:33:28,093 --> 01:33:29,161
Um...

972
01:33:32,930 --> 01:33:34,165
I...

973
01:33:41,406 --> 01:33:43,342
I miss you, Mae.

974
01:33:51,650 --> 01:33:54,320
The world isn't the same without you.

975
01:34:07,299 --> 01:34:11,068
You'll be happy to know that

976
01:34:11,070 --> 01:34:14,303
my parents said that if we lose,

977
01:34:14,305 --> 01:34:17,740
they'll have to pay the settlement

978
01:34:17,742 --> 01:34:19,210
and I'll have to get a job.

979
01:34:22,580 --> 01:34:26,184
Hopefully it involves some
polyester brand uniform.

980
01:34:36,393 --> 01:34:39,896
If you have any say in it,

981
01:34:39,898 --> 01:34:44,400
it'll involve horizontal stripes

982
01:34:44,402 --> 01:34:47,736
and the previous employee's body odor.

983
01:34:50,575 --> 01:34:51,911
Amen.

984
01:35:05,957 --> 01:35:07,526
I'm so sorry.

985
01:35:13,398 --> 01:35:15,534
I love you so much.

986
01:35:20,839 --> 01:35:23,109
We love you so much.

987
01:36:10,217 --> 01:36:15,217
