[engine stops]

4
00:01:51,227 --> 00:01:52,462
Fuck.

5
00:02:00,236 --> 00:02:01,571
Where are you?

00:02:05,307 --> 00:02:08,644
[opera music playing]

7
00:02:55,857 --> 00:02:57,527
Where's my dad?

[grunting]

11
00:03:34,563 --> 00:03:36,298
I have what you want.

12
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:38,668
Now let him go.

13
00:03:39,934 --> 00:03:42,037
Hey. Give it to me.

14
00:03:56,652 --> 00:03:59,355

15
00:04:00,422 --> 00:04:01,824
[man] <i>It's Martin, right?</i>

16
00:04:02,658 --> 00:04:03,893
[Martin] <i>Yes, sir.</i>

17
00:04:05,059 --> 00:04:06,461
You seem a little uncomfortable
sitting here with us.

18
00:04:06,729 --> 00:04:08,498
I am, a little.

19
00:04:10,031 --> 00:04:12,368
What can you tell us
about EquivoCorp?

20
00:04:12,868 --> 00:04:13,903
The abstract.

21
00:04:16,071 --> 00:04:17,971
The abstract of it...

22
00:04:17,973 --> 00:04:21,444
EquivoCorp is an MNE whose
primary assets range across

23
00:04:21,876 --> 00:04:24,614
real estate, hotel groups,
and logistics.

24
00:04:25,381 --> 00:04:26,616
And?

25
00:04:26,848 --> 00:04:28,814
And they recently acquired
the start-up Crash,

26
00:04:28,816 --> 00:04:32,519
which developed an algorithm to
optimize short-term rental software.

27
00:04:32,521 --> 00:04:34,090
You think it was a wise choice?

28
00:04:36,023 --> 00:04:39,028
Hedging their bets, while keeping
their competition off scent...

29
00:04:39,795 --> 00:04:41,963
- seems smart to me.
- To me, as well.

30
00:04:42,564 --> 00:04:43,732
- Yes, sir, and...
- For me...

31
00:04:44,432 --> 00:04:46,899
as well, Mr. Duran.

32
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:47,836
It's Duran.

33
00:04:50,138 --> 00:04:52,441
Which is why
I was so surprised

34
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,379
when this poorly written novel
filtered across my desk yesterday.

35
00:04:58,013 --> 00:05:01,047
I'm sorry. Now, my job is
BSA compliance.

36
00:05:01,049 --> 00:05:02,682
I did an exhaustive
risk analysis...

37
00:05:02,684 --> 00:05:04,951
Hide all you want
behind your compliance shield

38
00:05:04,953 --> 00:05:07,821
and your patriotic
anti-money laundering jargon.

39
00:05:07,823 --> 00:05:11,690
What I want to know is what
exactly was going through your head

40
00:05:11,692 --> 00:05:13,894
when you filed this report
and made it impossible

41
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:18,701
for a company with revenue exceeding
7 billion to do business with us.

42
00:05:19,535 --> 00:05:20,937
No jargon!

43
00:05:22,437 --> 00:05:23,872
Too many blind alleys.

44
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,743
I was seeing payments coming from
and going into encrypted accounts.

45
00:05:27,942 --> 00:05:30,009
- I mean, I could show you in the report.
- Bernard.

46
00:05:30,011 --> 00:05:32,612
This is as much my fault
as it is Martin's.

47
00:05:32,614 --> 00:05:35,551
I demand a culture of complete
compliance in my department.

48
00:05:35,817 --> 00:05:39,185
Martin was doing the job that you hired
him to do and the one I expect him to do.

49
00:05:39,187 --> 00:05:41,454
Let me make myself clear
to the two of you.

50
00:05:41,456 --> 00:05:43,923
You weren't hired because
I want you here.

51
00:05:43,925 --> 00:05:47,961
You were hired because we had to,
we were forced to, to remain in business.

52
00:05:47,963 --> 00:05:51,400
You're a necessary evil at best.
You're radiation therapy.

53
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,570
- That's better than being cancer.
- [woman] Martin.

54
00:05:58,172 --> 00:05:59,775
We're done.

55
00:06:02,044 --> 00:06:03,412
Ms. Whiting, please stay.

56
00:06:07,482 --> 00:06:08,850
Thank you, Mr. Duran.

00:06:15,657 --> 00:06:17,223
[Bernard]
<i>Where did you find this kid?</i>

58
00:06:17,225 --> 00:06:19,559
<i>I can't decide whether he's
a complete idiot</i>

59
00:06:19,561 --> 00:06:21,694
- <i>or some kind of savant.</i>
- Fuck you.

Kappa at Williams College, 2010.</i>

<i>Turned down a lot of money
to work here in AML.</i>

65
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:36,711
[Bernard]
<i>So you've weaponized autism?</i>

66
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:38,513
[Robin] <i>You could say that.</i>

67
00:06:38,814 --> 00:06:40,482
<i>But he's our weapon.</i>

68
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:42,951
[Bernard] <i>And you have him aimed
directly at our balance sheet.</i>

69
00:06:44,186 --> 00:06:46,656
<i>This is serious, and we need
to do something about it.</i>

70
00:06:47,222 --> 00:06:49,656
<i>He's got to go, Robin.
He's got to go.</i>

71
00:06:49,658 --> 00:06:52,562
[Robin] <i>Bernard, I hear you.
But there's another option.</i>

72
00:06:53,127 --> 00:06:54,793
Hey, Martin.

73
00:06:54,795 --> 00:06:56,932
Sorry. Robin needs to see you
in her office.

74
00:07:00,102 --> 00:07:01,768
Shit.

75
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,105
[Robin] Leverage? What,
are you kidding me?

76
00:07:04,372 --> 00:07:06,074
No, we're not calling the FBI.
We're paying them to go away.

77
00:07:07,475 --> 00:07:10,846
Oh, come on. Remember, these are
kids in their parents' basements.

78
00:07:12,948 --> 00:07:15,952
No, it's in everybody's best interest
to avoid federal involvement.

79
00:07:17,052 --> 00:07:18,087
Okay.

80
00:07:18,886 --> 00:07:20,189
What did he say?

81
00:07:21,989 --> 00:07:24,192
- What you drawing?
- A unicorn.

82
00:07:25,227 --> 00:07:27,726
It's good. I like it.

83
00:07:27,728 --> 00:07:30,230
Okay, well, you know what? Just tell him
I have to call him back 'cause... No!

84
00:07:30,232 --> 00:07:32,598
No, absolutely not.

85
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,802
Tell him not to pay a single dime
until I'm in the room negotiating.

86
00:07:35,804 --> 00:07:37,670
Your mom's gonna yell at me.

87
00:07:37,672 --> 00:07:38,874
Fine.

88
00:07:39,641 --> 00:07:41,677
Hey, Cindy.
Could you come in here, please?

89
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,711
Hey, could please take Molly
to the kitchen for a snack?

90
00:07:44,713 --> 00:07:46,082
Of course. Come on, Molly.

91
00:07:47,816 --> 00:07:50,152
Hey, fist bump.
I'll see you later.

92
00:07:51,086 --> 00:07:52,952
Hey, no sugar.

93
00:07:52,954 --> 00:07:54,689
[Cindy]
Let's go get you a snack.

94
00:07:59,627 --> 00:08:02,130
$10,000 a year
for art lessons.

95
00:08:03,631 --> 00:08:04,934
You know what this is?

96
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:07,269
It's a unicorn.

97
00:08:11,105 --> 00:08:12,307
Like you.

98
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,610
You did the right thing,
Martin.

99
00:08:15,076 --> 00:08:16,745
It took real guts
to do what you did.

100
00:08:17,345 --> 00:08:18,881
Then what's the catch?

101
00:08:19,948 --> 00:08:23,016
They're reassigning you
to a local branch...

102
00:08:23,018 --> 00:08:25,121
- temporarily.
- Well, that's subtle.

103
00:08:27,088 --> 00:08:28,324
Where are they sending me?

104
00:08:30,191 --> 00:08:31,626
Elba, New York.

105
00:08:33,828 --> 00:08:35,762
You know that's where I grew up.

106
00:08:35,764 --> 00:08:37,600
Two birds with one stone,
Martin.

107
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:40,866
The AML officer there is taking
early retirement, health reasons.

108
00:08:40,868 --> 00:08:43,802
You know the area. You'll have an
easier time orienting yourself.

109
00:08:43,804 --> 00:08:45,337
This is political exile.

110
00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:47,307
Oh, come on,
it can't be that bad.

111
00:08:47,309 --> 00:08:50,246
It's so bad they sent Napoleon
to the other Elba.

112
00:08:52,179 --> 00:08:53,583
You still have family there?

113
00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:54,983
Yeah.

114
00:09:00,921 --> 00:09:03,423
Well, I'm sure they'll be thrilled
to hear about your return.

115
00:09:03,425 --> 00:09:06,728
Oh, yeah. Just thrilled.

116
00:09:07,762 --> 00:09:09,696
<i>When do I have to be there?</i>

117
00:09:09,698 --> 00:09:11,601
[Robin] <i>About five minutes
after that meeting ended.</i>

118
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,035
<i>Little advice from a friend?</i>

119
00:09:14,902 --> 00:09:16,104
Less is more.

120
00:09:16,838 --> 00:09:18,040
Got it?

121
00:09:18,305 --> 00:09:19,742
Yeah.

122
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,112
[Robin] <i>Good.</i>

123
00:09:25,447 --> 00:09:27,183
Don't go around me again.

124
00:09:30,251 --> 00:09:32,988
[man on radio] <i>...sold
our children into slavery.</i>

125
00:09:33,387 --> 00:09:34,790
- <i>For what?</i>
- [turns radio off]

126
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:48,804
[country music playing
on radio]

127
00:10:00,281 --> 00:10:03,819
[receptionist] Okay, I just need
you to sign right here for this.

128
00:10:34,281 --> 00:10:35,850
[dings]

129
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,517
[man] All right,
see you next time, bro.

130
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,988
Great. See you.

131
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,124
Why is this thing asking me
for Bitcoin?

132
00:10:45,126 --> 00:10:47,025
You actually take
Bitcoin here?

133
00:10:47,027 --> 00:10:49,798
Absolutely.
I prefer it over cash.

134
00:10:50,397 --> 00:10:51,831
[woman] Why?

135
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:54,433
[man] Because it's fast,
cheap to use,

136
00:10:54,435 --> 00:10:57,372
it's private, and central
governments can't take it away.

137
00:10:58,173 --> 00:11:00,443
Look, I just want to convert
plastic to paper.

138
00:11:00,876 --> 00:11:03,942
Paper gets me alcohol,
and the alcohol gives me a nice buzz.

139
00:11:03,944 --> 00:11:07,116
Be honest. How many people in this
town even know what Bitcoin is?

140
00:11:07,348 --> 00:11:09,017
Good things take time.

141
00:11:09,483 --> 00:11:10,819
[Martin] Earl.

142
00:11:13,221 --> 00:11:14,453
[Earl] Holy...

143
00:11:14,455 --> 00:11:16,057
Marty Duran?

144
00:11:16,525 --> 00:11:19,194
What's up, man?
What are you doing here?

145
00:11:20,227 --> 00:11:22,061
No, I mean what the fuck
are you doing back here?

146
00:11:22,063 --> 00:11:24,433
I thought you were some kind
of big-shot banker in the city.

147
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:26,901
It's a long story.

148
00:11:27,301 --> 00:11:29,137
- [Martin] What are you doing here?
- Forget it.

149
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,173
Oh, hey, sorry
for the inconvenience.

150
00:11:34,309 --> 00:11:35,477
It's...

151
00:11:36,343 --> 00:11:39,314
It's mine.
My dad left it to me.

152
00:11:40,048 --> 00:11:41,917
He died a couple years
after high school.

153
00:11:42,383 --> 00:11:45,019
- I had no idea.
- Why would you?

154
00:11:45,319 --> 00:11:47,055
Hated this place growing up.

155
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,092
Remember when we used
to steal beer?

156
00:11:50,858 --> 00:11:53,094
No, man. I remember when
we stole a bottle of whiskey.

157
00:11:53,862 --> 00:11:55,427
You remember which kind?

158
00:11:55,429 --> 00:11:57,165
Oh, I'll never forget.

159
00:11:58,065 --> 00:11:59,398
[together] Flamethrower.

160
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,033
[both laughing]

161
00:12:01,035 --> 00:12:03,235
We still carry that shit.
People drink it.

162
00:12:03,237 --> 00:12:04,939
- No.
- Yeah, man.

163
00:12:06,174 --> 00:12:07,242
How's business?

164
00:12:08,444 --> 00:12:11,179
Fucking terrible.
Have you been to the west side yet?

165
00:12:13,113 --> 00:12:15,550
- There ain't a west side.
- Dude, you've been living under a rock?

166
00:12:17,049 --> 00:12:20,189
The town's gentrifying.
Manscaped beards and feathered fedoras.

167
00:12:20,421 --> 00:12:22,457
There's even some
swanky art gallery.

168
00:12:22,924 --> 00:12:26,395
What business used to trickle
its way here is all dried up.

169
00:12:27,194 --> 00:12:30,031
Your brother's the only person
keeping this place in business.

170
00:12:31,065 --> 00:12:32,164
- Yeah.
- [beeping]

171
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,569
Shit. Hang on.

172
00:12:51,118 --> 00:12:52,588
Holy shit, Earl.

173
00:12:53,021 --> 00:12:54,519
What the hell is all this?

174
00:12:54,521 --> 00:12:56,889
Hang on,
time is of the essence.

175
00:12:56,891 --> 00:12:58,393
I'm getting in on this ICO.

176
00:12:58,993 --> 00:13:00,393
Is that Bitcoin?

177
00:13:00,395 --> 00:13:02,995
No, man. It's for this new token
called Delta Coin.

178
00:13:02,997 --> 00:13:04,529
It's a new app they're building
on the US blockchain.

179
00:13:04,531 --> 00:13:06,666
The white paper's the shit,
really cutting-edge.

180
00:13:06,668 --> 00:13:07,602
You want to get in on it?

181
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,538
No, I'm good.

182
00:13:10,604 --> 00:13:12,437
Your electric bill's got
to be insane.

183
00:13:12,439 --> 00:13:15,977
No, man, it's all good.
Only 10% of whatever I'm mining.

184
00:13:16,176 --> 00:13:19,144
Plus the crypto day-trading,
I average like 500 a day.

185
00:13:19,146 --> 00:13:21,346
You heard about the TRAC coin?

186
00:13:21,348 --> 00:13:24,619
To be honest, I only understand about
5% of what you're talking about.

187
00:13:25,252 --> 00:13:26,421
Seriously?

188
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:30,226
Dang, man. You better brush up.
This shit is the future of money.

189
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,491
[coin-dropping noise]

190
00:13:32,493 --> 00:13:34,396
So you're back to help out
your dad and bro?

191
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:37,299
- Looks like they could use it.
- No, I...

192
00:13:38,132 --> 00:13:41,634
I'm just dealing with some compliance
issues at the Omni branch here.

193
00:13:41,636 --> 00:13:43,171
Just being modest.

194
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,506
What do I owe you
for the beer?

195
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,174
Get the fuck out of here.
Your money's no good to me.

196
00:13:49,176 --> 00:13:50,311
Oh, come on.

197
00:13:51,578 --> 00:13:54,149
Old times, dude.
Just steal it.

198
00:13:59,087 --> 00:14:01,086
Hey, don't be a stranger.

199
00:14:01,088 --> 00:14:02,324
Wouldn't think of it.

200
00:14:25,213 --> 00:14:26,412
[man] Hey!

201
00:14:26,414 --> 00:14:28,384
[in Russian]

202
00:14:31,486 --> 00:14:33,554
[opera music playing]

203
00:14:43,064 --> 00:14:45,668
[opera music continues]

204
00:14:51,106 --> 00:14:52,374
[man] That's him.

205
00:14:53,675 --> 00:14:56,142
- Hey, you must be Marty.
- Yes.

206
00:14:56,144 --> 00:14:58,647
You are right on time, just as Ms.
Whiting said you would be.

207
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,279
Would you like a slice of cake?

208
00:15:01,281 --> 00:15:02,417
No, thank you.

209
00:15:03,318 --> 00:15:05,083
Oh. Of course.

210
00:15:05,085 --> 00:15:07,255
Uh, let me introduce
you to everyone.

211
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:09,489
- Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen...
- Actually...

212
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:13,493
I prefer to keep my presence here
discrete during my initial audit.

213
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:18,167
These types of things, they work a little
better if there's some... separation.

214
00:15:20,401 --> 00:15:21,734
Okay.

215
00:15:21,736 --> 00:15:23,304
[man] We like to think
of ourselves as a family.

216
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:26,642
And... here we are.

217
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:31,576
You got your coffee station
over here, nice little setup.

218
00:15:31,578 --> 00:15:34,650
Files are all organized.
You can find what you need over here.

219
00:15:35,282 --> 00:15:37,218
Got your computer, your desk.

220
00:15:38,218 --> 00:15:39,121
Chair.

221
00:15:39,788 --> 00:15:41,223
Make yourself at home.

222
00:15:41,488 --> 00:15:43,056
Um... [scoffs]

223
00:15:43,058 --> 00:15:45,158
Eric is supposed to take care
of this,

224
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,594
but I don't know when he's
gonna get around to it, so...

225
00:15:48,596 --> 00:15:50,299
Let me know
if you need anything.

226
00:15:50,497 --> 00:15:52,300
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

227
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:55,471
[imitating man] Chair.

228
00:15:58,705 --> 00:16:00,141
I got a few more for you.

229
00:16:00,474 --> 00:16:01,642
You can just put them...

230
00:16:03,477 --> 00:16:05,144
Just put them wherever.

231
00:16:05,146 --> 00:16:06,745
You got all your existing
LEC files in there,

232
00:16:06,747 --> 00:16:09,617
transaction reports
and any SAR paperwork.

233
00:16:09,851 --> 00:16:12,721
And then all your due diligence
reports with the new LEC are up there.

234
00:16:14,088 --> 00:16:17,025
Yeah, that Janice.
She definitely fell a little behind.

235
00:16:17,224 --> 00:16:19,258
I'm sorry to hear she's sick.

236
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,396
Is there any chance I could
speak with her before she leaves?

237
00:16:21,596 --> 00:16:24,596
No, she's already gone,
but I can get you her number.

238
00:16:24,598 --> 00:16:25,599
Thanks.

239
00:16:26,534 --> 00:16:29,104
I'd like to preserve
any continuity if possible,

240
00:16:29,838 --> 00:16:31,640
given the circumstances.

241
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,044
You don't recognize me,
do you?

242
00:16:37,344 --> 00:16:38,546
I'm sorry.

243
00:16:38,746 --> 00:16:40,616
We went to high school
together.

244
00:16:41,815 --> 00:16:44,452
- Auto shop.
- Man, it's...

245
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,423
- It's been such a long time...
- It's fine.

246
00:16:48,323 --> 00:16:49,525
Drew.

247
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:51,559
Smith.

248
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,226
Oh, yeah, yeah.

249
00:16:54,228 --> 00:16:55,296
Of course.

250
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:59,264
- I'm sorry, man. I'm an idiot.
- Don't worry, man.

251
00:16:59,266 --> 00:17:02,703
This whole town's forgettable,
so just kill me.

252
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,276
If you need anything else,
let me know.

253
00:17:10,177 --> 00:17:11,746
[door closes]

254
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:52,588
- Hey, what's your name?
- I'm Bill.

255
00:17:53,187 --> 00:17:54,519
Have you seen Drew?

256
00:17:54,521 --> 00:17:56,290
I think he's at lunch.

257
00:17:57,825 --> 00:17:59,692
I'm trying to figure out why Endelman
Gallery didn't file CTR exemptions.

258
00:17:59,694 --> 00:18:01,129
- Don't know.
- [man] Marty.

259
00:18:06,867 --> 00:18:08,302
So it's true.

260
00:18:10,972 --> 00:18:12,574
Hi, Caleb.

261
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,344
That's it, huh?

262
00:18:17,511 --> 00:18:19,481
We haven't seen each other
since Mom died.

263
00:18:20,581 --> 00:18:22,216
Ten years.

264
00:18:22,716 --> 00:18:23,784
"Hi, Caleb"?

265
00:18:26,887 --> 00:18:28,322
Well, you look good.

266
00:18:28,889 --> 00:18:30,291
Doing real well.

267
00:18:31,225 --> 00:18:32,727
Yeah, well, it's been a while.

268
00:18:35,829 --> 00:18:37,198
Cool mug.

269
00:18:43,338 --> 00:18:44,836
How's Dad?

270
00:18:44,838 --> 00:18:46,474
What do you fucking care?

271
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:51,445
[cell phone ringtone playing]

272
00:18:56,483 --> 00:18:57,685
Later.

273
00:18:58,586 --> 00:18:59,755
Hello?

274
00:19:03,023 --> 00:19:04,760
[muffled] No. Yeah, I found him.

275
00:19:07,528 --> 00:19:09,865
- [phone ringing]
- [truck engine starts]

276
00:19:15,936 --> 00:19:19,038
Can you find me the CIP file
for Endelman Gallery?

277
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,907
I need their physical address,
and also I need Janice's number.

278
00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:24,312
Sure.

279
00:19:50,538 --> 00:19:51,673
Hello?

280
00:20:17,865 --> 00:20:19,367
[woman] Can I help you?

281
00:20:19,867 --> 00:20:21,002
Hi.

282
00:20:21,536 --> 00:20:24,373
- Did I...
- Yes, you did.

283
00:20:24,672 --> 00:20:26,775
- The other day.
- Okay.

284
00:20:27,107 --> 00:20:29,107
- Wow.
- Wow?

285
00:20:29,109 --> 00:20:30,411
No, sorry.

286
00:20:30,978 --> 00:20:32,681
No, I just mean it's...

287
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,450
You were at the liquor store,
and now you're here.

288
00:20:35,716 --> 00:20:38,853
Well, art dealers moonlight
as normal people, too, you know?

289
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:41,355
We have livers,
just like everyone else.

290
00:20:41,989 --> 00:20:44,559
I'm going to start over.
I'm Martin.

291
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:47,058
I distinctly heard your friend
call you Marty,

292
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,763
so I think I'm going
to call you Marty.

293
00:20:49,097 --> 00:20:51,465
- I'm Katie.
- Katie, hi.

294
00:20:51,933 --> 00:20:54,499
- What brings you in today?
- Actually, I...

295
00:20:54,501 --> 00:20:56,102
I need to talk to the owner.

296
00:20:56,104 --> 00:20:57,905
Just some routine bank stuff.

297
00:20:58,138 --> 00:21:01,842
I'm an AML officer.
It's anti-money laundering.

298
00:21:02,876 --> 00:21:05,813
That sounds very official.
Which hand do I salute with?

299
00:21:06,513 --> 00:21:08,015
Well, you need Penelope.

300
00:21:08,915 --> 00:21:11,116
Yes. Yeah.

301
00:21:11,118 --> 00:21:13,818
She's not the actual owner,
which you wouldn't know by talking to her.

302
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,324
But she's kind of like
a franchisee.

303
00:21:16,624 --> 00:21:18,923
- Cool.
- Okay, Marty. What's your last name?

304
00:21:18,925 --> 00:21:20,662
Duran. Martin Duran.

305
00:21:21,128 --> 00:21:22,795
All right. I'll go get her.

306
00:21:22,797 --> 00:21:25,733
Sit tight. And... buckle up.

307
00:21:27,001 --> 00:21:28,403
Okay.

308
00:21:38,011 --> 00:21:43,018
You... are far too gorgeous
to be a banker.

309
00:21:43,518 --> 00:21:45,520
Look at that bone structure.

310
00:21:45,886 --> 00:21:47,987
Hi, I'm... I'm Martin.

311
00:21:47,989 --> 00:21:50,792
Yes, yes, of course you are.
Blah, blah, blah.

312
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:53,495
What is this?

313
00:21:55,797 --> 00:21:56,798
Macy's?

314
00:21:58,465 --> 00:21:59,934
Oh, God, here it comes.

315
00:22:01,336 --> 00:22:03,972
A beautiful boy from New York City
has arrived to see me and I...

316
00:22:04,438 --> 00:22:05,940
I think to myself,
"Oh, thank God."

317
00:22:06,441 --> 00:22:07,705
But then...

318
00:22:07,707 --> 00:22:09,944
this, a piece
of country candy.

319
00:22:10,677 --> 00:22:12,845
The kind you have to suck on
for a little bit,

320
00:22:12,847 --> 00:22:15,684
where it gets stuck between your teeth.
Do you know what I mean?

321
00:22:17,652 --> 00:22:18,953
No, I...

322
00:22:20,155 --> 00:22:22,991
I'm sorry, I just need to ask
you about your financials.

323
00:22:23,723 --> 00:22:27,928
I noticed the bank might have
filed inappropriate CTR exemptions.

324
00:22:28,963 --> 00:22:30,632
If I could just verify
your books.

325
00:22:31,598 --> 00:22:34,034
Do I look like the kind
of person who keeps books?

326
00:22:36,203 --> 00:22:37,973
We have an accountant.

327
00:22:38,673 --> 00:22:40,138
You'll need to speak to him.

328
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:43,010
That's fine.
I just need his information.

329
00:22:44,244 --> 00:22:46,814
Kat, get him
David's information.

330
00:22:47,581 --> 00:22:49,582
- You mean Ted?
- Yes, yes.

331
00:22:49,584 --> 00:22:51,787
Whatever the fuck his name is.

332
00:22:59,092 --> 00:23:00,461
I'll be right back.

333
00:23:01,596 --> 00:23:04,195
- You have some beautiful art in here.
- Yes, I do.

334
00:23:04,197 --> 00:23:05,964
Do you appreciate art?

335
00:23:05,966 --> 00:23:07,134
I try to.

336
00:23:07,768 --> 00:23:08,804
Try...

337
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:12,007
One doesn't try
to appreciate art.

338
00:23:13,007 --> 00:23:16,945
An alpinist doesn't try to summit.
That's all there is.

339
00:23:17,712 --> 00:23:22,017
The climax is in realization.
You either reach the climax,

340
00:23:22,782 --> 00:23:23,851
or you don't.

341
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:25,886
Wouldn't you say?

342
00:23:27,187 --> 00:23:28,823
I guess so.

343
00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:36,030
I don't buy it.

344
00:23:37,231 --> 00:23:39,901
All this trying and...

345
00:23:40,233 --> 00:23:42,670
guessing that you talk about.

346
00:23:45,973 --> 00:23:48,909
Kat, see Mr. Duran out.

347
00:23:49,242 --> 00:23:51,143
- Wow.
- I warned you.

I have no fucking idea what
you're talking about right now.

to see me today at the gallery.

360
00:24:40,595 --> 00:24:41,963
Or was that yesterday?

361
00:24:42,996 --> 00:24:45,099
Either way,
he was asking questions.

362
00:24:48,101 --> 00:24:49,703
[Ted] What kind of questions?

363
00:24:53,974 --> 00:24:55,010
Hey.

365
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,016
I don't know.

Banks, hedge funds,
they're buying up crypto.

Maybe for investment purposes,
but I think they're trying to sabotage it.

Why would they do that?

453
00:33:44,504 --> 00:33:46,337
They can't control it.

454
00:33:46,339 --> 00:33:48,373
No centralized regulation.
It cuts them out of the action.

455

But I thought it was
all dark-web shit.

It is to some degree,

458
00:33:54,714 --> 00:33:57,452
but the banks use all that shit to inject
a moral element that doesn't exist.

459
00:33:57,684 --> 00:34:00,585
Trust me. The central banks are
going to try and destroy it.

- How?

- No, I...
- I know you did.

And don't say it's your job.
You had no good reason.

I'm just honest enough to admit it.

521
00:37:48,082 --> 00:37:52,620
A couple of years. And I've worked
at the gallery like six months or so.

522
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:55,655
It feels like
a fucking eternity.

523
00:37:58,624 --> 00:38:00,927
What's up with you
and your brother?

524
00:38:02,828 --> 00:38:04,497
I don't know.

525
00:38:05,131 --> 00:38:07,001
He's not a bad guy.

526
00:38:08,602 --> 00:38:11,839
In another life he could
have been a gentleman.

527
00:38:13,006 --> 00:38:16,410
There's two words that don't belong
together when I think of my brother.

528
00:38:16,843 --> 00:38:18,713
[woman] Anything else
for the two of you?

529
00:38:20,546 --> 00:38:22,749
We're okay, Marcy. Thanks.

530
00:38:27,787 --> 00:38:31,189
You know, Marcy refinanced her
house to keep this place going.

531
00:38:31,191 --> 00:38:32,893
She's so deep in the hole...

532
00:38:33,459 --> 00:38:34,861
she'll never make it out.

533
00:38:35,961 --> 00:38:37,397
Seriously?

534
00:38:38,664 --> 00:38:39,800
Yeah.

535
00:38:42,435 --> 00:38:46,406
You must know all kinds of things,
back there behind the curtain.

536
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:49,542
Yeah, but it's all depressing.

537
00:38:50,577 --> 00:38:52,513
I never wanted
to come back here.

538
00:38:53,946 --> 00:38:56,450
You know, everyone is
so fucking predictable.

539
00:38:58,818 --> 00:39:00,553
And full of surprises.

540
00:39:12,031 --> 00:39:13,834
[Martin]
Thanks for seeing me, Janice.

541
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,972
I was going through Endelman
Gallery's customer ID file.

542
00:39:19,071 --> 00:39:22,675
I'm not entirely satisfied with
the way due diligence was handled.

543
00:39:23,243 --> 00:39:26,547
Did you run them
against OFAC or FinCEN?

544
00:39:28,948 --> 00:39:30,117
Okay.

545
00:39:31,383 --> 00:39:34,218
Were you responsible for filing
the suspicious activity reports?

546
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,087
Look, don't be naive.

547
00:39:36,089 --> 00:39:38,089
Most of the business
in a town like this

548
00:39:38,091 --> 00:39:40,991
is underwritten by handshakes
and mutual respect.

549
00:39:40,993 --> 00:39:42,727
No, I understand that.

550
00:39:42,729 --> 00:39:45,098
I'm just trying to establish
some continuity here.

551
00:39:45,832 --> 00:39:47,902
Well, I think that's going
to be hard for you to do.

552
00:39:48,502 --> 00:39:49,901
Excuse me?

553
00:39:49,903 --> 00:39:53,774
I'm afraid I left things
in quite a mess.

554
00:39:55,008 --> 00:39:59,944
I just got so sick
and I waited too long to retire.

555
00:39:59,946 --> 00:40:03,717
Afraid I'd lose my job
and my health insurance.

556
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,888
I should get out
of your hair now.

557
00:40:12,124 --> 00:40:14,027
I'm sorry, I...

558
00:40:14,227 --> 00:40:15,529
That's okay.

559
00:40:16,062 --> 00:40:18,095
Is that all you need?

560
00:40:18,097 --> 00:40:20,066
I just need to know if there's anything
you can tell me about Endelman.

561
00:40:20,734 --> 00:40:22,102
Endelman...

562
00:40:22,968 --> 00:40:24,070
Um...

563
00:40:25,238 --> 00:40:27,004
Carcass... No.

564
00:40:27,006 --> 00:40:28,508
Carcasse.

565
00:40:29,008 --> 00:40:30,975
- Carcasse?
- Mm-hmm.

566
00:40:30,977 --> 00:40:35,712
I asked the accountant who owned
the business and he said "Carcasse."

567
00:40:35,714 --> 00:40:38,049
But then I asked him
to clarify,

568
00:40:38,051 --> 00:40:40,521
and he corrected himself
and said, "Never mind."

569
00:40:40,854 --> 00:40:43,557
I don't even know why
I remember that. I'm sorry.

570
00:40:45,057 --> 00:40:47,694
- Well, thank you so much for your help.
- Thank you.

571
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,660
Yeah.

572
00:40:49,662 --> 00:40:52,098
Can I confess something
to you?

573
00:40:53,966 --> 00:40:55,602
Sure.

574
00:40:57,071 --> 00:40:59,673
Meeting you has given me great faith
that you'll sort everything out.

575
00:41:04,077 --> 00:41:04,979
Yeah.

576
00:41:23,062 --> 00:41:24,664
[knocking on door]

577
00:41:25,164 --> 00:41:26,533
[sighing]

578
00:41:29,935 --> 00:41:31,035
[knocking continues]

579
00:41:31,037 --> 00:41:32,740
Did you forget something?

580
00:41:37,877 --> 00:41:38,545
Who are you?

581
00:41:39,111 --> 00:41:41,180
- Didn't Marcos call you?
- No.

582
00:41:42,147 --> 00:41:44,919
Yeah, his son injured his ankle
playing soccer today.

583
00:41:45,352 --> 00:41:48,122
He's been dealing with that all
day, and he asked me to fill in.

584
00:41:50,723 --> 00:41:52,660
Okay, come on in.

585
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,294
I really don't like surprises.

586
00:41:56,296 --> 00:41:58,895
[man] Don't worry,
Marcos gave me your protocol.

587
00:41:58,897 --> 00:42:00,133
We'll fix you right up.

588
00:42:08,675 --> 00:42:10,611
So Marcos has a son, huh?

589
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:13,146
I didn't even know that.

590
00:42:14,981 --> 00:42:16,316
The things you don't know.

591
00:42:18,885 --> 00:42:21,386
This may pinch just a bit.

592
00:42:21,388 --> 00:42:22,823
I know.

593
00:42:24,823 --> 00:42:25,892
Ow!

594
00:42:26,158 --> 00:42:27,327
You okay?

595
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,095
Yeah.

596
00:42:29,995 --> 00:42:31,365
Yeah, I'm fine.

597
00:42:32,832 --> 00:42:34,799
- [sighing]
- All set.

598
00:42:34,801 --> 00:42:36,036
Okay.

599
00:42:52,151 --> 00:42:56,055
[man on TV] <i>Aye. And I wager it's
on account of them two strangers.</i>

600
00:42:57,823 --> 00:42:58,858
No...

601
00:42:59,191 --> 00:43:00,660
That burns.

602
00:43:01,026 --> 00:43:02,929
- What are you...
- No, just give it a second.

603
00:43:03,396 --> 00:43:04,765
That can happen sometimes.

604
00:43:06,031 --> 00:43:08,366
[breathing heavily]

605
00:43:08,368 --> 00:43:10,067
There we go.

606
00:43:10,069 --> 00:43:11,838
[man on TV]
<i>To all my friends in Nevada...</i>

607
00:43:12,939 --> 00:43:14,738
[Janice groaning]

608
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:16,175
<i>...my deepest appreciation</i>

609
00:43:17,109 --> 00:43:20,111
<i>for the way you've honored me.</i>

610
00:43:20,113 --> 00:43:21,214
[man] It's okay.

611
00:43:21,814 --> 00:43:24,816

612
00:43:24,818 --> 00:43:26,319
[man on TV]
<i>But for personal reasons,</i>

613
00:43:26,986 --> 00:43:29,656
<i>I hereby withdraw my name</i>

614
00:43:32,124 --> 00:43:33,893
<i>for consideration</i>

615
00:43:35,227 --> 00:43:37,097
<i>as a possible candidate</i>

616

<i>for governor of the state
of Nevada.</i>

617
00:43:44,104 --> 00:43:46,774
Mr. Patterson,
this is Martin Duran again.

618
00:43:47,372 --> 00:43:49,443
I'd really appreciate
if you'd call me back.

619
00:43:49,876 --> 00:43:52,245
I just have a few questions
about the Endelman Gallery.

620
00:43:52,444 --> 00:43:54,881
It shouldn't take any time.
Thanks.

621
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:18,805
Carcasse.

622
00:44:22,908 --> 00:44:23,975
[beeps]

623
00:44:23,977 --> 00:44:25,179
So much for that.

624
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,348
[cell phone dings]

625
00:44:35,053 --> 00:44:36,423
What the hell is this?

626
00:44:59,144 --> 00:45:00,213
[dings]

627
00:45:04,984 --> 00:45:07,317
<i>Martin, hey. Just checking in.</i>

628
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:10,124
- <i>How are things going?</i>
- I'm all right. It's...

629
00:45:11,089 --> 00:45:13,359
It's a little bit
of a mess, but...

630
00:45:13,892 --> 00:45:16,095
<i>Wow. Well, you are
the right man for the job.</i>

631
00:45:17,263 --> 00:45:21,499
<i>Hey, look, the reason I'm calling
is we've got a bit of a situation.</i>

632
00:45:21,501 --> 00:45:24,134
What does that mean?

633
00:45:24,136 --> 00:45:26,904
<i>Apparently Omni's been experiencing
an unusual amount of cyber intrusion.</i>

634
00:45:26,906 --> 00:45:28,339
- Really?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

635
00:45:28,341 --> 00:45:30,473
<i>And the bank is running
an internal audit</i>

636
00:45:30,475 --> 00:45:33,180
<i>and they just released a list of
personnel they'd like to question.</i>

637
00:45:33,546 --> 00:45:35,345
<i>And you and I are on it.</i>

638
00:45:35,347 --> 00:45:37,982
Sorry, but why the hell
are we on the list?

639
00:45:37,984 --> 00:45:40,250
<i>It doesn't mean we're suspects.
It might just as soon mean</i>

640
00:45:40,252 --> 00:45:43,154
<i>that we're people they can rely
upon for an honest testimonial.</i>

641
00:45:43,156 --> 00:45:46,360
<i>So they've set up a time for you
to do an interview next week.</i>

642
00:45:47,593 --> 00:45:49,128
<i>Hey, look. I got to jump.</i>

643
00:45:49,495 --> 00:45:51,127
<i>I just wanted to give you
a heads-up.</i>

644
00:45:51,129 --> 00:45:53,163
<i>And please don't mention
this to anybody.</i>

645
00:45:53,165 --> 00:45:55,035
<i>You and I have nothing to hide.</i>

646
00:45:56,002 --> 00:45:57,905
- <i>I'll talk to you soon.</i>
- Okay.

647
00:46:02,575 --> 00:46:04,011
Shit.

648
00:46:05,178 --> 00:46:06,180
[cell phone dings]

649
00:46:12,084 --> 00:46:13,386
[Katie] <i>What's wrong?</i>

650
00:46:13,919 --> 00:46:15,321
<i>You look worried.</i>

651
00:46:16,756 --> 00:46:20,057
Somehow the bank thinks I'm involved
with some hacking thing, which is...

652
00:46:20,059 --> 00:46:23,030
insane because I don't know
the first thing about the stuff.

653
00:46:24,564 --> 00:46:25,999
Is that all?

654
00:46:26,399 --> 00:46:28,101
It's kind of a big deal.

655
00:46:30,002 --> 00:46:35,105
Well, not necessarily.
It could be a routine or random.

656
00:46:35,107 --> 00:46:37,241
I mean, if you were running
an investigation,

657
00:46:37,243 --> 00:46:40,047
would you want your subjects to
know you were investigating them?

658
00:46:40,245 --> 00:46:41,414
That's a good point.

659
00:46:42,147 --> 00:46:43,416
What's really bothering you?

660
00:46:45,017 --> 00:46:47,417
I met with the lady
I replaced at the bank.

661
00:46:47,419 --> 00:46:49,088
- Janice.
- Oh, yeah?

662
00:46:49,488 --> 00:46:52,525
I feel really bad for her.
She's a sweetheart.

663
00:46:53,225 --> 00:46:55,261
I mean, she just made
a ton of mistakes.

664
00:46:56,662 --> 00:46:59,398
And there was one thing she said
that stuck with me, though.

665
00:47:00,232 --> 00:47:02,033
Well, about Endelman Gallery,
actually.

666
00:47:02,035 --> 00:47:03,433
- Really?
- Yeah.

667
00:47:03,435 --> 00:47:05,569
What?

668
00:47:05,571 --> 00:47:10,444
She said that when Ted Patterson came in
to do the initial compliance paperwork

669
00:47:11,176 --> 00:47:13,711
there was some confusion about
who the owner was.

670
00:47:13,713 --> 00:47:17,551
Then he said he was mistaken
and listed Penelope, rushing.

671
00:47:18,718 --> 00:47:22,122
I mean, you said yourself Penelope's
not technically the owner.

672
00:47:23,055 --> 00:47:25,455
I'll be honest.
I said that because I hate my boss

673
00:47:25,457 --> 00:47:27,360
and my only power's
insubordination.

674
00:47:28,593 --> 00:47:30,463
So she does own the gallery?

675
00:47:31,397 --> 00:47:33,296
[Earl] Dude, what the fuck?

676
00:47:33,298 --> 00:47:34,467
- Hi.
- Sorry.

677
00:47:34,667 --> 00:47:36,002
Did you get my text?

678
00:47:36,301 --> 00:47:37,604
Is this about Bitcoin again?

679
00:47:38,136 --> 00:47:39,504
Yeah, a new ICO.

680
00:47:40,305 --> 00:47:44,243
Hey, man. Sorry, I feel like I'm
always yelling when you're around.

681
00:47:45,544 --> 00:47:47,444
I'm going to get back
to the gallery.

682
00:47:47,446 --> 00:47:48,515
I'll text you later.

683
00:47:51,417 --> 00:47:53,921
Dude, you got to see this.
Now.

684
00:47:55,988 --> 00:47:58,723
- [Martin] I can't be doing this.
- No, you can't not be doing this.

685
00:47:58,725 --> 00:48:02,258
If you care about what you do as a whistle-blower,
you can't afford not to see this.

686
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:03,660
[Martin]
There's too much gray area.

687
00:48:03,662 --> 00:48:05,196
Isn't that your job?

688
00:48:05,198 --> 00:48:07,464
Why do you suddenly care
so much about this?

689
00:48:07,466 --> 00:48:10,066
When I see things like this,
I get pretty worried.

690
00:48:10,068 --> 00:48:13,139
Fine, man. Just show me.
Let's get this over with.

691
00:48:16,542 --> 00:48:19,542
[Earl] See what I did there with the
clues I sent you? Pretty clever, huh?

692
00:48:19,544 --> 00:48:21,544
[Martin] Super clever.

693
00:48:21,546 --> 00:48:23,513
I love those clues.
<i>Blue's Clues,</i> Jacques Clue-steau,

694
00:48:23,515 --> 00:48:25,618
- <i>Clues Encounters of the Third Kind.</i>
- I get it.

695
00:48:27,586 --> 00:48:31,190
There. This is Omni's last quarter's
investment in cryptocurrencies.

696
00:48:31,691 --> 00:48:35,026
- [Martin] Holy shit.
- Holy shit is right.

697
00:48:35,028 --> 00:48:37,230
Ten mil isn't
a casual investment.

698
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:39,732
They used something called Merkel
Trading as an intermediary.

699
00:48:40,533 --> 00:48:44,234
No phone number, no email.
Just query fields.

700
00:48:44,236 --> 00:48:45,671
Click the "about" page.

701
00:48:47,472 --> 00:48:49,740
They're an OTC front.

702
00:48:49,742 --> 00:48:52,776
My guess is they're buying Bitcoin
over-the-counter to avoid market slippage.

703
00:48:52,778 --> 00:48:54,712
What's that?

704
00:48:54,714 --> 00:48:55,716
They don't want to rock the
boat they're climbing into.

705
00:49:03,656 --> 00:49:05,225
What else?

706
00:49:05,557 --> 00:49:07,725
Well, I'm not exactly sure.

707
00:49:07,727 --> 00:49:10,330
Merkel was a brick wall, so naturally
I figured out a way to scale it.

708
00:49:12,631 --> 00:49:15,068
Transactions, shitloads of them.

709
00:49:15,401 --> 00:49:16,834
This is Omni.

710
00:49:16,836 --> 00:49:18,769
And these are the entities
they're buying from.

711
00:49:18,771 --> 00:49:21,337
They bought a lot of Bitcoin
from a lot of different people.

712
00:49:21,339 --> 00:49:23,174
- Okay.
- Now these folks are smart.

713
00:49:23,176 --> 00:49:24,841
They're using Tor networks
to keep their shit hush-hush,

714
00:49:24,843 --> 00:49:25,878
so I used a bad apple attack.

715
00:49:26,812 --> 00:49:29,412
Earl, you're very smart,
but why does this matter?

716
00:49:29,414 --> 00:49:31,381
Only a tinfoil hat.

717
00:49:31,383 --> 00:49:35,388
None of it mattered until I saw it
was all coming from one IP address.

718
00:49:35,787 --> 00:49:37,757
And that IP is located...

719
00:49:39,825 --> 00:49:41,327
- [Martin] Canada?
- Yep.

720
00:49:41,526 --> 00:49:43,828
Carcasse Bait and Tackle,
to be precise.

721
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:45,699
What did you say?

722
00:49:46,164 --> 00:49:47,798
[Earl] Bait and Tackle? Yeah, I
know, the possibilities are endless.

723
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,767
Something fishy going on,
classic bait-and-switch...

724
00:49:49,769 --> 00:49:51,604
No, no. The...

725
00:49:52,205 --> 00:49:54,471
- The first word.
- Carcasse?

726
00:49:54,473 --> 00:49:55,508
[entry chime rings]

727
00:50:01,613 --> 00:50:02,846
This is insane.

728
00:50:02,848 --> 00:50:04,350
What?

729
00:50:08,354 --> 00:50:10,187
You've got to figure out
what's going on in this place.

730
00:50:10,189 --> 00:50:11,754
Well, I'm not going up there.

731
00:50:11,756 --> 00:50:13,756
There's a healthy possibility
they're just a mirror,

732
00:50:13,758 --> 00:50:15,292
and I don't want to kick
a hornet's nest.

733
00:50:15,294 --> 00:50:17,397
- [bell rings]
- Be right there.

734
00:50:20,432 --> 00:50:21,598
[bell rings]

735
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,069
Jesus, guy.

736
00:50:35,448 --> 00:50:36,316
Hello.

737
00:50:36,848 --> 00:50:39,285
Hey, man, you following me
or something?

738
00:50:39,484 --> 00:50:40,385
Yes.

739
00:50:43,555 --> 00:50:45,758
No, I remembered you owned
a liquor store.

740
00:50:46,425 --> 00:50:49,763
And then I saw you at the diner
and I thought, "This is your fate."

741
00:50:50,263 --> 00:50:54,334
Right, shit.
Sorry, I was pretty wasted that night.

742
00:50:55,167 --> 00:50:56,336
So, what's up, man?

743
00:50:56,568 --> 00:50:58,871
I was wondering
if you have... vodka.

744
00:50:59,504 --> 00:51:01,273
Yeah, sure, man.
Over in aisle two.

745
00:51:01,707 --> 00:51:04,611
No. Not this factory piss.

746
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:07,113
Real vodka.

747
00:51:09,247 --> 00:51:10,349
I'll write a name down
for you.

748
00:51:10,649 --> 00:51:11,684
You'll like it.

749
00:51:14,386 --> 00:51:15,622
You have paper?

750
00:51:24,263 --> 00:51:26,529
This can be hard to find,
but...

751
00:51:26,531 --> 00:51:29,435
I don't think it will be hard
to find... for you.

752
00:51:30,368 --> 00:51:31,571
What do you mean?

753
00:51:32,338 --> 00:51:33,205
Nothing.

754
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,841
[Earl] How will I let you know
if I get it in?

755
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:37,711
You don't have to.

756
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:39,778
I'm following you,
remember?

757
00:51:40,713 --> 00:51:41,915
I'll see you around.

758
00:51:59,631 --> 00:52:02,635
So you think you can figure out what's
going on in this Carcasse place?

759
00:52:03,935 --> 00:52:04,838
Yeah, I think so.

760
00:52:06,238 --> 00:52:07,870
Well, I have another big favor
to ask.

761
00:52:07,872 --> 00:52:10,374
My favor bank is
running pretty low, my friend.

762
00:52:10,376 --> 00:52:13,280
No, I know. I know.
And I'll make it up to you.

763
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:15,348
Yeah, what is it?

764
00:52:15,747 --> 00:52:17,684
Tell me this isn't us
poking around.

765
00:52:21,754 --> 00:52:23,890
[Earl]
No, this is way bigger than us.

766
00:52:24,756 --> 00:52:25,923
[Martin] Okay.

767
00:52:25,925 --> 00:52:28,528
[ringing]

768
00:52:31,863 --> 00:52:34,031
- Hello?
- [on phone] <i>Yeah, this is Ted Patterson. You called?</i>

769
00:52:34,033 --> 00:52:36,033
Thanks for returning my call,
Mr. Patterson.

770
00:52:36,035 --> 00:52:37,901
<i>Okay, can you come
to my office?</i>

771
00:52:37,903 --> 00:52:40,370
- Yeah, of course.
- <i>Tomorrow, in the a.m.</i>

772
00:52:40,372 --> 00:52:41,707
Yeah, tomorrow morning's
perfect.

773
00:52:42,274 --> 00:52:43,910
- [Martin whispering] I'll call you later.
- Yeah, cool.

774
00:52:44,343 --> 00:52:47,414
- <i>You know where it is?</i>
- Yeah, I'll see you then.

775
00:52:59,524 --> 00:53:01,260
[train whistle blows]

776
00:53:07,365 --> 00:53:09,401
[opera music playing
in background]

777
00:53:09,602 --> 00:53:10,870
[door slams]

778
00:53:11,803 --> 00:53:12,705
I'm sorry.

779
00:53:13,305 --> 00:53:14,837
I'm here to see
Ted Patterson.

780
00:53:14,839 --> 00:53:15,908
Yeah, your name?

781
00:53:16,341 --> 00:53:17,640
Martin Duran.

782
00:53:17,642 --> 00:53:19,008
Can I offer you anything
to drink?

783
00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:20,410
No, thanks.

784
00:53:20,412 --> 00:53:22,312
Okay, right this way.

785
00:53:22,314 --> 00:53:24,381
- That's a cool accent.
- Thank you.

786
00:53:24,383 --> 00:53:25,551
Where are you from?

787
00:53:25,885 --> 00:53:27,354
- Brooklyn.
- All right.

788
00:53:29,455 --> 00:53:30,991
Martin Duran is here.

789
00:53:31,957 --> 00:53:33,292
All right, send him in.

790
00:53:35,361 --> 00:53:36,663
Mr. Duran, how you doing?

791
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:39,562
- I'm all right.
- [receptionist] Do you need anything else?

792
00:53:39,564 --> 00:53:40,934
Yes, actually.

793
00:53:44,002 --> 00:53:44,937
Shred it.

794
00:53:52,944 --> 00:53:55,111
Thank you for seeing me,
Mr. Patterson.

795
00:53:55,113 --> 00:53:57,881
Yeah, no problem.
Call me Ted, have a seat.

796
00:53:57,883 --> 00:54:01,488
I promise, there is a madness
to my method here.

797
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,856
I was just finishing up
your request right now.

798
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:08,861
- That's it?
- In all her glory.

799
00:54:09,928 --> 00:54:12,562
I just have a few questions.

800
00:54:12,564 --> 00:54:15,434
That won't be necessary.
Everything you need is somewhere in there.

801
00:54:16,602 --> 00:54:17,734
Thank you.

802
00:54:17,736 --> 00:54:19,435
Though, I'm curious.

803
00:54:19,437 --> 00:54:21,441
Does the name Carcasse
mean anything to you?

804
00:54:23,042 --> 00:54:23,943
No, why?

805
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:27,044
Well, Janice from the bank,
she mentioned you...

806
00:54:27,046 --> 00:54:30,783
you said Carcasse when she
was filing the CIP report.

807
00:54:31,015 --> 00:54:32,519
Janice from the bank...

808
00:54:33,084 --> 00:54:34,920
Oh, Janice, well...

809
00:54:35,521 --> 00:54:37,790
I think you and I can both agree
that she is not

810
00:54:38,057 --> 00:54:39,689
the sharpest knife
in the drawer.

811
00:54:39,691 --> 00:54:41,125
That's not necessary.

812
00:54:41,127 --> 00:54:42,729
What's not necessary?

813
00:54:44,497 --> 00:54:45,765
I meant no offense.

814
00:54:46,064 --> 00:54:50,633
So you're saying you never
mentioned Carcasse to her?

815
00:54:50,635 --> 00:54:52,703
No, I'm just saying Janice is
a very sick woman

816
00:54:52,705 --> 00:54:55,071
and I bet a lot of things that
she's saying right now are...

817
00:54:55,073 --> 00:54:56,975
not really based in reality,
right?

818
00:54:57,642 --> 00:54:59,713
But hey, you want clarity, huh?

819
00:55:01,147 --> 00:55:02,882
You should probably go talk
to Janice.

820
00:55:03,415 --> 00:55:04,551
Yeah.

821
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:09,755
Hey, kid.

822
00:55:11,624 --> 00:55:14,026
Why are you acting like
such a fucking cowboy, huh?

823
00:55:15,428 --> 00:55:17,060
- What do...
- Does it make you feel like a big man

824
00:55:17,062 --> 00:55:18,995
to walk around this town like
a hotshot from the city,

825
00:55:18,997 --> 00:55:20,599
auditing people's lives?

826
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,100
Let me tell you something.

827
00:55:23,102 --> 00:55:25,002
The Endelman Gallery?

828
00:55:25,004 --> 00:55:26,740
That's the best thing to happen
to this town in a long time.

829
00:55:27,539 --> 00:55:29,675
You're acting like you want
to find something wrong with it.

830
00:55:30,142 --> 00:55:31,845
With all due respect...

831
00:55:32,944 --> 00:55:34,747
you're acting like I'm going to.

832
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:39,783
Hey, I get it.
I hated my daddy, too.

833
00:55:39,785 --> 00:55:42,586
You know? Fucking loser
who couldn't hang on to a dollar

834
00:55:42,588 --> 00:55:43,921
unless you nailed it
to his hand.

835
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:45,125
Don't...

836
00:55:46,057 --> 00:55:47,559
talk about my family.

837
00:55:48,961 --> 00:55:51,964
You don't know anything about me
or my father.

838
00:55:53,064 --> 00:55:54,434
Well...

839
00:55:55,066 --> 00:55:58,167
I do know that
he was offered seven figures

840
00:55:58,169 --> 00:55:59,805
for that starve-acre farm
of his.

841
00:56:00,872 --> 00:56:02,205
I had a client
who was interested.

842
00:56:02,207 --> 00:56:04,410
I mean, you and me,
we're both money guys.

843
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:06,977
You know that that was
an offer of a lifetime.

844
00:56:06,979 --> 00:56:09,415
He's never going to get another
offer like that again.

845
00:56:10,548 --> 00:56:11,984
Seven figures.

846
00:56:13,986 --> 00:56:15,989
But guys like your daddy...

847
00:56:16,988 --> 00:56:19,191
they were born to work
in the dust and the mud.

848
00:56:24,229 --> 00:56:25,865
They're tough
and they're stubborn.

849
00:56:29,234 --> 00:56:31,437
They're just fucking clueless,
am I right?

850
00:56:34,939 --> 00:56:36,142
Yeah.

851
00:56:45,917 --> 00:56:47,820
[train whistle blows]

852
00:57:09,975 --> 00:57:11,211
There we go.

853
00:57:23,821 --> 00:57:25,825
- What?
- Seven figures.

854
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:28,058
Seven fucking figures.

855
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:29,929
I don't understand how
you could turn that down.

856
00:57:30,595 --> 00:57:32,162
Well, seeing as how
this is my fucking farm,

857
00:57:32,164 --> 00:57:34,501
I'm not quite sure how
that's any of your business.

858
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,135
But I can see you need it.

859
00:57:36,568 --> 00:57:38,634
So I'm going to fill you in
on a couple of things.

860
00:57:38,636 --> 00:57:39,805
Your brother...

861
00:57:40,705 --> 00:57:42,508
he's not the same
since he got back.

862
00:57:44,276 --> 00:57:47,080
Every lit match is
a forest fire to him now.

863
00:57:48,113 --> 00:57:49,345
Then get him help.

864
00:57:49,347 --> 00:57:51,250
Aw, Jesus,
there's a good idea.

865
00:57:51,883 --> 00:57:53,850
He won't keep his appointments
at the VA.

866
00:57:53,852 --> 00:57:55,718
Hell, he won't even go
to any of his meetings.

867
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,123
He just shoots his guns
and drinks, that's it.

868
00:57:59,091 --> 00:58:00,593
As long as I'm alive,

869
00:58:00,959 --> 00:58:03,359
I make goddamn sure
he's got somewhere to land.

870
00:58:03,361 --> 00:58:04,630
Every day.

871
00:58:05,597 --> 00:58:07,800
So, yeah. Yeah,
I turned that money down.

872
00:58:10,803 --> 00:58:12,839
- So what are you going to do?
- I ought to just...

873
00:58:13,305 --> 00:58:15,605
Try and get what survived
the frost, picked and sold,

874
00:58:15,607 --> 00:58:16,843
keep our heads above water.

875
00:58:17,109 --> 00:58:19,176
Looks like there's another
cold snap coming in, too.

876
00:58:19,178 --> 00:58:21,047
So if you're not here to help...

877
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:23,550
- I got it.
- Thank you.

878
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:36,062
What pisses you off so much about
me going to make a life for myself?

879
00:58:41,834 --> 00:58:42,902
What?

880
00:58:43,702 --> 00:58:44,801
Nothing.

881
00:58:44,803 --> 00:58:47,640
Then what is it?
What did I do?

882
00:58:49,707 --> 00:58:52,177
You could have waited until we
put your mother in the ground.

883
00:58:54,312 --> 00:58:56,081
Oh, I abandoned you?

884
00:58:57,149 --> 00:58:58,818
Don't make me laugh.

885
00:59:01,086 --> 00:59:02,155
Where were you?

886
00:59:03,187 --> 00:59:05,023
While Mom was sick in bed,

887
00:59:05,390 --> 00:59:07,659
Caleb was in Iraq,
where were you?

888
00:59:07,859 --> 00:59:11,662
All that shit they were pumping into
her body had to be paid for, asshole.

889
00:59:11,664 --> 00:59:13,966
I had to do it.
I was out here!

890
00:59:15,901 --> 00:59:17,203
Yeah, and the Gin Mill.

891
00:59:17,970 --> 00:59:20,673
Oh, for Christ's sake,
the Gin Mill.

892
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:23,675
The fucking Gin Mill.

893
00:59:29,682 --> 00:59:30,850
You know, junior...

894
00:59:32,251 --> 00:59:34,754
I like to think you're the smartest
guy I know, that's the truth.

895
00:59:36,088 --> 00:59:39,288
But when a woman you shared a bed with
for 22 years is told she's a goner

896
00:59:39,290 --> 00:59:41,024
and there's not a thing
you can do about it,

897
00:59:41,026 --> 00:59:44,297
well, you just handle it
the best way you can think of.

898
00:59:45,863 --> 00:59:47,300
Spend a little time
at the Gin Mill.

899
00:59:47,832 --> 00:59:49,068
It seemed like a good idea.

900
00:59:50,035 --> 00:59:52,038
It just always turned into
a lot of time.

901
00:59:53,238 --> 00:59:54,674
That's all.

902
00:59:56,374 --> 00:59:57,909
Never enough.

903
01:00:02,847 --> 01:00:05,117
You'd have handled that
a lot different.

904
01:00:09,455 --> 01:00:11,090
You'd have handled that
a lot better.

905
01:00:18,497 --> 01:00:19,999
You know something, junior?

906
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:24,336
Smart as you are, I thought you'd
have figured that one out by now.

907
01:00:41,053 --> 01:00:42,821
[tractor engine starts]

908
01:01:13,452 --> 01:01:14,486
Try to keep up.

909
01:01:15,988 --> 01:01:18,091
You might want to rethink
your footwear next time.

910
01:01:22,794 --> 01:01:25,798
Penelope mentioned you met
with Ted. How was that?

911
01:01:26,164 --> 01:01:27,464
You were definitely right
about him.

912
01:01:27,466 --> 01:01:29,299
The guy's
a real piece of work.

913
01:01:29,301 --> 01:01:32,038
I said something about Endelman
and he got kind of aggressive.

914
01:01:32,437 --> 01:01:33,937
What did you say?

915
01:01:33,939 --> 01:01:35,441
Just the word "Carcasse."

916
01:01:36,908 --> 01:01:39,042
What's that?

917
01:01:39,044 --> 01:01:41,314
I have no idea. It's the one thing
Janice remembers clearly and...

918
01:01:41,879 --> 01:01:43,249
Ted wishes she'd forget.

919
01:01:44,082 --> 01:01:45,917
I thought you might know
something about it.

920
01:01:46,185 --> 01:01:48,287
No, Penelope deals
with him directly.

921
01:01:49,388 --> 01:01:52,122
I'm getting a whiff of mild
conspiracy coming off of you.

922
01:01:52,124 --> 01:01:54,861
Maybe you've been hanging out
with your Bitcoin buddy too much.

923
01:01:55,827 --> 01:01:57,095
Come on, it's not much further.

924
01:02:23,021 --> 01:02:24,957
That song you sang
the other night,

925
01:02:26,290 --> 01:02:28,193
you said it was
your mom's favorite.

926
01:02:29,227 --> 01:02:31,897
Yeah, she sang it
all the time.

927
01:02:34,899 --> 01:02:36,135
She...

928
01:02:36,401 --> 01:02:38,337
passed away recently.

929
01:02:39,370 --> 01:02:43,376
Made some bad choices
about how to cope with life.

930
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:46,245
I'm really sorry.

931
01:02:48,946 --> 01:02:50,816
I lost my mom, too.

932
01:02:52,251 --> 01:02:53,486
It was a while ago.

933
01:02:55,653 --> 01:02:57,155
It still hurts.

934
01:02:58,122 --> 01:02:59,325
Yeah.

935
01:03:03,028 --> 01:03:04,930
What is it about
a good view...

936
01:03:06,164 --> 01:03:08,100
that just makes people want
to talk?

937
01:03:10,269 --> 01:03:12,305
I always think about her
when I come up here.

938
01:03:15,207 --> 01:03:17,009
You used to
come here together?

939
01:03:20,144 --> 01:03:21,280
No, never.

940
01:03:29,287 --> 01:03:32,157
[man] I know all of you are probably
having some pretty strong emotions.

941
01:03:33,091 --> 01:03:35,194
If anybody wants to talk,
let me know.

942
01:03:48,573 --> 01:03:50,006
Did you hear?

943
01:03:50,008 --> 01:03:51,276
What's going on?

944
01:03:51,676 --> 01:03:53,546
Janice... she died.

945
01:03:54,446 --> 01:03:57,283
I just saw her.
What happened?

946
01:03:58,082 --> 01:03:59,584
They're saying it was
an assisted suicide.

947
01:04:00,484 --> 01:04:02,488
But they're
still investigating.

948
01:04:04,189 --> 01:04:06,158
I'm... sorry.

949
01:04:07,024 --> 01:04:08,227
Thanks.

950
01:04:33,118 --> 01:04:34,718
This place is almost as dark
as my office.

951
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:35,955
The fuck are you doing here?

952
01:04:38,289 --> 01:04:39,958
I'm going to give you
what I found, but then I'm out.

953
01:04:41,493 --> 01:04:43,392
I don't want anything more to do with
this, and I don't get deposed, okay?

954
01:04:43,394 --> 01:04:44,629
Just slow down.

955
01:04:45,097 --> 01:04:46,395
Now what are you talking about?

956
01:04:46,397 --> 01:04:47,700
I'm a ghost in this.

957
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:49,432
Promise?

958
01:04:49,434 --> 01:04:51,202
Okay, I promise.

959
01:04:56,508 --> 01:04:59,377
For the sake of getting
everything, I recorded my screen.

960
01:05:01,747 --> 01:05:06,616
[Earl on recording] <i>Okay, running monitor
darkly script on Carcasse Bait and Tackle.</i>

961
01:05:06,618 --> 01:05:08,084
What am I looking at here?

962
01:05:08,086 --> 01:05:09,618
Just wait,
I'm about to tell you.

963
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:13,355
<i>On a computer, if you want
to peep, just go to the source.</i>

964
01:05:13,357 --> 01:05:14,493
<i>The monitor.</i>

965
01:05:14,725 --> 01:05:17,530
<i>Okay, that's a little creepy.</i>

966
01:05:18,363 --> 01:05:21,000
<i>Running motion detection
in the BG.</i>

967
01:05:21,665 --> 01:05:23,133
<i>Looks like we got some action.</i>

968
01:05:25,569 --> 01:05:27,673
<i>Let's see what the fine patrons of
Carcasse Bait Shop use their bandwidth for.</i>

969
01:05:28,339 --> 01:05:30,142
<i>All right, what's that?</i>

970
01:05:32,044 --> 01:05:33,412
<i>"Come and get it"...</i>

971
01:05:34,312 --> 01:05:35,146
<i>in Russian.</i>

972
01:05:38,682 --> 01:05:41,519
<i>Okay. I've got
a few more accounts.</i>

973
01:05:42,486 --> 01:05:45,992
<i>Now it looks like our subject is
sending ruble to various accounts.</i>

974
01:05:47,325 --> 01:05:49,792
<i>Looks like he's receiving
Bitcoin, four different accounts.</i>

975
01:05:49,794 --> 01:05:51,664
<i>Checking ruble-to-Bitcoin
exchange rate...</i>

976
01:05:52,798 --> 01:05:54,600
<i>Yep, for the exact amount
he sent in rubles.</i>

977
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:58,167
<i>But the accounts he's receiving from
are different than the ones he sent to.</i>

978
01:05:58,169 --> 01:05:59,435
A currency tumbler.

979
01:05:59,437 --> 01:06:02,372
Yep. Digital Cayman Islands.

980
01:06:02,374 --> 01:06:04,274
<i>We're going to do a little bit
of sneaky shit here</i>

981
01:06:04,276 --> 01:06:05,711

who they're selling to.</i>

982
01:06:06,644 --> 01:06:10,448
<i>Okay, now I just have to see
from whence these comrades came</i>

983
01:06:11,850 --> 01:06:14,386
<i>Oh, shit.
They're all coming from...</i>

984
01:06:14,752 --> 01:06:16,555
- <i>Carcasse.</i>
- Carcasse.

985
01:06:18,189 --> 01:06:20,593
<i>Which means we are now very likely
looking at a money laundering business.</i>

986
01:06:21,493 --> 01:06:22,595
Fuck.

987
01:06:24,629 --> 01:06:26,198
I'm not going any deeper.

988
01:06:27,832 --> 01:06:30,834
Remember that guy who came in
the other day asking for vodka?

989
01:06:30,836 --> 01:06:32,303
Yeah, I remember.

990
01:06:32,537 --> 01:06:34,372
Well, I looked it up.

991
01:06:34,839 --> 01:06:36,274
It doesn't exist.

992
01:06:41,113 --> 01:06:42,615
But it does link to this.

993
01:06:43,247 --> 01:06:44,716

Fuck, just turn that off.

996
01:07:02,633 --> 01:07:05,167
This isn't white-collar shit
anymore, do you understand?

997
01:07:05,169 --> 01:07:08,173
This is "you get skinned alive
and have to watch" kind of collar.

998
01:07:08,874 --> 01:07:11,209
- [door opens]
- [Drew] Knock, knock. Oh.

999
01:07:11,475 --> 01:07:13,542
Hey, sorry.
What's going on in here?

1000
01:07:13,544 --> 01:07:16,081
[Earl] Hey, man. Nothing,
just IT stuff.

1001
01:07:16,281 --> 01:07:18,384
This guy needs to stop watching
so much porn.

1002
01:07:20,185 --> 01:07:21,387
You too, by the way.

1003
01:07:21,685 --> 01:07:23,789
No judgment.
Just some friendly advice.

1004
01:07:27,392 --> 01:07:30,261
Um... the girl
from Endelman called.

1005
01:07:30,562 --> 01:07:31,764
She was hoping
you'd stop by.

1006
01:07:32,196 --> 01:07:33,432
All right, thanks.

1007
01:07:35,332 --> 01:07:36,501
[Martin] Katie!

1008
01:07:37,769 --> 01:07:39,205
Hello?

1009
01:07:45,443 --> 01:07:47,879
Hey, I'm sorry.
Have you seen Katie?

1010
01:07:50,515 --> 01:07:51,684
What do you think?

1011
01:07:52,684 --> 01:07:54,683
I'm not really qualified
to say.

1012
01:07:54,685 --> 01:07:55,817
[sighs]

1013
01:07:55,819 --> 01:07:57,122
- I think Katie...
- Your...

1014
01:07:57,888 --> 01:08:00,693
country mouse act is so dreary.

1015
01:08:01,626 --> 01:08:04,763
I saw right through it the first time
you walked in, in that outlet mall suit.

1016
01:08:05,763 --> 01:08:07,499
You're a very clever boy.

1017
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:09,801
Indulge me.

1018
01:08:14,606 --> 01:08:16,242
It makes me feel...

1019
01:08:16,807 --> 01:08:18,144
lonely.

1020
01:08:19,945 --> 01:08:22,414
Like my life is outside of me.

1021
01:08:23,214 --> 01:08:24,449
It's a giant fucking mess.

1022
01:08:28,787 --> 01:08:30,256
Or...

1023
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:34,293
is life very mysterious?

1024
01:08:34,892 --> 01:08:36,294
And remote?

1025
01:08:36,761 --> 01:08:38,531
And it's we who are the mess?

1026
01:08:39,698 --> 01:08:41,531
This is like
the million-dollar question.

1027
01:08:41,533 --> 01:08:42,801
Eight million.

1028
01:08:44,336 --> 01:08:48,173
Mr. Hiroshito paid $8 million
just last night.

1029
01:08:48,873 --> 01:08:50,276
Well, that's incredible.

1030
01:08:50,574 --> 01:08:51,809
Congratulations.

1031
01:08:52,776 --> 01:08:54,547
So is Katie here?

1032
01:08:55,747 --> 01:08:57,449
She didn't come to work today.

1033
01:08:58,682 --> 01:08:59,851
I called you.

1034
01:09:01,019 --> 01:09:02,454
You?

1035
01:09:03,954 --> 01:09:05,290
Why?

1036
01:09:05,690 --> 01:09:07,593
'Cause you've been asking

01:27:16,747 --> 01:27:18,045
These people are dangerous.

1208
01:27:18,047 --> 01:27:19,113
[Drew]
Whose fucking tongue is that?

1209
01:27:19,115 --> 01:27:20,651
What time is it?

1210
01:27:20,883 --> 01:27:22,720
It's 2:37.

1211
01:27:23,354 --> 01:27:25,890
- Just let me think for a second.
- Fuck that!

1212
01:27:26,923 --> 01:27:28,760
That's not Dad's tongue, Caleb.

1213
01:27:29,126 --> 01:27:31,061
[Drew] Then who the fuck's
tongue is that?

1214
01:27:31,994 --> 01:27:33,297
[Martin] Caleb!

1215
01:27:33,529 --> 01:27:34,831
Just wait a second.

1216
01:27:35,766 --> 01:27:37,502
Caleb, stop and listen to me.

1217
01:27:38,369 --> 01:27:39,570
Just look at me.

1218
01:27:40,104 --> 01:27:41,306
Caleb...

1219
01:27:42,004 --> 01:27:43,074
Get out of the way.

1220
01:27:48,011 --> 01:27:49,681
You're pointing
a gun at me.

1221
01:27:51,047 --> 01:27:53,517
It's almost 3:00.
They have Dad.

1222
01:27:54,418 --> 01:27:56,354
Get the fuck out of the way.

1223
01:27:59,856 --> 01:28:01,391
We're going
to get him back.

1224
01:28:03,793 --> 01:28:05,495
But we need
to be smart.

1225
01:28:14,937 --> 01:28:16,440
Hey, it's Marty.

1226
01:28:17,675 --> 01:28:19,110
This is either the smartest
phone call I've ever made...

1227
01:28:19,943 --> 01:28:21,079
or the dumbest.

1228
01:28:42,065 --> 01:28:43,801
[in Russian]

1229
01:28:46,837 --> 01:28:47,939
Now get in the truck.

1230
01:28:49,205 --> 01:28:50,738
You all right?

1231
01:28:50,740 --> 01:28:52,443
They broke my arm.

1232
01:28:54,778 --> 01:28:55,812
Oops.

1233
01:28:57,480 --> 01:28:59,550
Maybe you're not
so fucking smart.

1234
01:29:05,221 --> 01:29:06,757
[Ted] So, I...

1235
01:29:08,092 --> 01:29:09,057
I assume that you're going to tell
me that you made copies of that

1236
01:29:09,059 --> 01:29:10,494
or something, right?

1237
01:29:11,494 --> 01:29:12,696
Yeah, I did.

1238
01:29:14,131 --> 01:29:15,732
And if I don't call my brother

1239
01:29:16,533 --> 01:29:18,636
and tell him my dad
and I are okay...

1240
01:29:19,837 --> 01:29:21,739
he drops
the files everywhere.

1241
01:29:22,672 --> 01:29:24,608
FBI, DEA,

1242
01:29:25,042 --> 01:29:26,177
everywhere.

1243
01:29:29,178 --> 01:29:30,580
You know what, cowboy?

1244
01:29:31,013 --> 01:29:32,917
I don't think you had time
to make copies.

1245
01:29:33,217 --> 01:29:34,619
So go ahead and call him.

1246
01:29:35,485 --> 01:29:37,421
Tell him you're not
going to be okay.

1247
01:29:40,022 --> 01:29:41,525
Call him.

1248
01:29:48,899 --> 01:29:50,834
[line ringing]

1249
01:29:52,235 --> 01:29:54,171
[cell phone ringtone playing]

1250
01:30:07,184 --> 01:30:09,220
Now, I'd be very careful
what you do next.

1251
01:30:10,988 --> 01:30:12,088
Knowing my brother,

1252
01:30:12,788 --> 01:30:14,758
every lit match is
a forest fire.

1253
01:30:18,529 --> 01:30:19,664
- Hey, hey.
- [Ted] Easy.

1254
01:30:19,863 --> 01:30:21,699
Hey, just calm the fuck down.

1255
01:30:25,702 --> 01:30:26,771
Hey...

1256
01:30:27,037 --> 01:30:30,071
let's just talk about
this, okay?

1257
01:30:30,073 --> 01:30:31,042
Yeah?

1258
01:30:32,142 --> 01:30:34,779
You and me,
we're both still money guys, right?

1259
01:30:35,779 --> 01:30:37,815
Your dad's farm,
the seven figures?

1260
01:30:38,181 --> 01:30:39,584
I can make that happen.

1261
01:30:41,784 --> 01:30:43,787
We can all walk away
from here happy.

1262
01:30:44,253 --> 01:30:45,655
Yeah?

1263
01:30:49,092 --> 01:30:50,795
You're so fucked.

1264
01:30:53,564 --> 01:30:56,066
[sirens wailing]

1265
01:30:57,601 --> 01:31:00,104
[shouting in Russian]

1266
01:31:07,977 --> 01:31:09,577
FBI, on the ground!

1267
01:31:09,579 --> 01:31:10,814
Get on the ground!

1268
01:31:11,614 --> 01:31:13,814
Drop the weapon,
get on the ground now.

1269
01:31:13,816 --> 01:31:16,753
Spread your legs,
keep your hands where I can see them.

1270
01:31:23,994 --> 01:31:25,263
There they go.

1271
01:31:29,098 --> 01:31:30,200
Hands behind your back.

1272
01:31:32,101 --> 01:31:33,203
Oops.

1273
01:31:34,770 --> 01:31:37,371
- This won't change anything.
- [FBI agent] Get up.

1274
01:31:37,373 --> 01:31:39,976
[on police radio] <i>We have two suspects fleeing
the scene on foot. We are in pursuit.</i>

1275
01:31:40,877 --> 01:31:41,846
FBI!

1276
01:31:42,111 --> 01:31:43,812
Get down!
Let me see your hands.

1277
01:31:43,814 --> 01:31:45,016
[speaking Russian]

1278
01:31:45,649 --> 01:31:47,151
[shouting] Stop!

1279
01:31:52,756 --> 01:31:55,726
- Look, I didn't...
- Junior, I don't think I want to know.

1280
01:31:57,060 --> 01:31:58,262
Get him some help?

1281
01:31:59,195 --> 01:32:00,897
[Mr. Duran] Yeah, he took
my boots.

1282
01:32:01,297 --> 01:32:03,264
Goddamn busted arm.

1283
01:32:03,266 --> 01:32:04,769
Where's Caleb?

1284
01:32:06,369 --> 01:32:07,704
Clear on your six!

1285
01:32:07,971 --> 01:32:09,006
Cover that door.

1286
01:32:09,905 --> 01:32:11,943
Check that door for me, Ken.

1287
01:32:19,281 --> 01:32:20,650
FBI!

1288
01:32:20,950 --> 01:32:22,052
Clear.

1289
01:32:33,195 --> 01:32:34,364
Clear, go.

1290
01:32:34,765 --> 01:32:35,967
[Katie] FBI!

1291
01:32:40,369 --> 01:32:41,972
- You hit?
- I'm okay.

1292
01:32:45,007 --> 01:32:47,010
- [on radio] <i>Shots fired!</i>
- <i>10-4.</i>

1293
01:32:48,712 --> 01:32:50,181
<i>Seven, do a sweep of the sector</i>

1294
01:33:19,275 --> 01:33:20,342
[gunshot]

1295
01:33:24,213 --> 01:33:25,783
FBI! On the ground.

1296
01:33:26,016 --> 01:33:27,752
Drop the gun, drop the gun!

1297
01:33:28,318 --> 01:33:29,349
Get down.

1298
01:33:29,351 --> 01:33:30,354
He's with me!

1299
01:33:30,854 --> 01:33:32,720
- Copy, stand down.
- Stand down.

1300
01:33:32,722 --> 01:33:34,956
[walkie-talkie chatter]

1301
01:33:34,958 --> 01:33:37,895
[siren wailing in distance]

1302
01:33:42,132 --> 01:33:44,499
- [FBI agent] Can I ask you some questions?
- [Mr. Duran] Sure, go ahead.

1303
01:33:44,501 --> 01:33:46,201
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

1304
01:33:46,203 --> 01:33:47,835
How's the arm?

1305
01:33:47,837 --> 01:33:49,372
It's good. It's all right.
It's not hurting.

1306
01:33:50,006 --> 01:33:51,142
Anything else hurting?

1307
01:33:51,408 --> 01:33:52,943
No. I'm good.

1308
01:33:53,409 --> 01:33:55,145
Your brother
was a hero today.

1309
01:33:58,381 --> 01:33:59,883
Yeah.

1310
01:34:03,386 --> 01:34:04,855
How did you find out
about me?

1311
01:34:08,190 --> 01:34:10,461
You said you lived in upstate
for two years.

1312
01:34:11,828 --> 01:34:13,964
But your bank account's
six months old.

1313
01:34:15,498 --> 01:34:18,202
It was air-tight,
just not to me.

1314
01:34:21,104 --> 01:34:22,373
But I figured...

1315
01:34:24,341 --> 01:34:26,410
you're either
a really bad criminal...

1316
01:34:28,211 --> 01:34:29,480
or you're undercover.

1317
01:34:37,020 --> 01:34:38,489
I do have one question.

1318
01:34:40,957 --> 01:34:42,426
Did your mom really die?

1319
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:45,729
She retired.

1320
01:34:46,562 --> 01:34:48,065
Moved to Fresno.

1321
01:34:51,133 --> 01:34:53,303
So she did make bad choices.

1322
01:34:56,306 --> 01:34:57,408
I'm sorry.

1323
01:35:00,910 --> 01:35:02,812
You'd think
it gets easier, but...

1324
01:35:04,079 --> 01:35:07,318
the lies just
keep getting harder.

1325
01:35:12,189 --> 01:35:14,225
I have to get back
to the city.

1326
01:35:16,293 --> 01:35:17,528
Look me up sometime.

1327
01:35:23,533 --> 01:35:25,102
I don't know
your real name.

1328
01:35:26,035 --> 01:35:27,404
You're a smart guy, Marty.

1329
01:35:35,579 --> 01:35:37,448
Any idea how long you were
in the van?

1330
01:35:39,915 --> 01:35:41,515
- Hmm?
- How long?

1331
01:35:41,517 --> 01:35:43,952
I don't know,
maybe a half hour or something.

1332
01:35:43,954 --> 01:35:46,557
Maybe an hour. They had the bag over
my head, so I didn't see anything.

1333
01:35:49,124 --> 01:35:51,895
[Martin] <i>It's uncertain to me
how high these conspiracies go.</i>

1334
01:35:52,462 --> 01:35:54,899
So forgive me if you know
what I'm about to say.

1335
01:35:55,931 --> 01:35:58,234
But during my investigation
of the Elba branch,

1336
01:35:58,501 --> 01:36:02,806
I discovered that OmniBank maintained
several dark accounts of cryptocurrency.

1337
01:36:03,539 --> 01:36:06,476
Furthermore, an employee of the
bank has been using these funds

1338
01:36:06,976 --> 01:36:10,013
in various illicit activities
with the Russian Mafia.

1339
01:36:11,381 --> 01:36:15,985
Robin Whiting, my boss and
chief AML officer at OmniBank,

1340
01:36:16,352 --> 01:36:19,256
has been enriching
her shareholders and herself

1341
01:36:20,123 --> 01:36:24,395
through racketeering, kickbacks from
cyber ransoms, money laundering,

1342
01:36:25,128 --> 01:36:26,397
murder.

1343
01:36:27,329 --> 01:36:29,065
[Bernard]
Can you prove any of this?

1344
01:36:29,632 --> 01:36:31,068
I can.

1345
01:36:36,573 --> 01:36:38,275
It's all right here.

1346
01:36:39,208 --> 01:36:40,410
Everything.

1347
01:36:41,977 --> 01:36:43,614
Courtesy of Earl Simmons.

1348
01:36:45,414 --> 01:36:47,117
A true friend and hero.

1349
01:36:53,155 --> 01:36:54,190
What is that?

1350
01:37:01,498 --> 01:37:02,433
[Robin] Martin.

1351
01:37:03,533 --> 01:37:05,599
What happened in there?
How'd it go?

1352
01:37:05,601 --> 01:37:08,338
Really well. I stayed in my
lane, just like you told me to.

1353
01:37:08,538 --> 01:37:12,040
Good. Good, we wouldn't want you
to get exiled again like...

1354
01:37:12,042 --> 01:37:13,977
Who was it you said?
Napoleon?

1355
01:37:15,678 --> 01:37:18,047
Do you know what happened to Napoleon after
he was banished to the island of Elba?

1356
01:37:20,283 --> 01:37:23,053
He escaped
and recaptured France.

1357
01:37:23,552 --> 01:37:24,652
Oh.

1358
01:37:24,654 --> 01:37:26,257
And, Robin...

1359
01:37:26,722 --> 01:37:28,993
a word of advice
from a friend.

1360
01:37:30,193 --> 01:37:32,363
When you talk with them,
less is more.

1361
01:37:33,229 --> 01:37:36,300
I think I'm fully equipped
to handle the board.

1362
01:37:36,598 --> 01:37:38,101
But thank you, Martin.

1363
01:37:38,368 --> 01:37:40,236
No, I'm not talking about
the board.

1364
01:37:47,377 --> 01:37:49,280
[FBI agent] Robin Whiting? FBI.

1365
01:37:49,611 --> 01:37:50,647
You're under arrest.

1366
01:37:51,146 --> 01:37:52,647
[Robin]
You've got to be kidding me.

1367
01:37:52,649 --> 01:37:54,381
No, you have no...

1368
01:37:54,383 --> 01:37:56,517
[FBI agent] You have the right
to remain silent.

1369
01:37:56,519 --> 01:37:58,219
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

1370
01:37:58,221 --> 01:37:59,990
You have the right
to an attorney.

1371
01:38:10,499 --> 01:38:11,568
Yo.

1372
01:38:18,507 --> 01:38:20,010
[coin-dropping noises]

1373
01:38:26,082 --> 01:38:27,618
- Marty!
- Jesus!

1374
01:38:28,517 --> 01:38:29,720
Fuck.

1375
01:38:31,788 --> 01:38:33,457
You scare pretty easy.

1376
01:38:35,525 --> 01:38:37,628
This looks like fun.
You working hard?

1377
01:38:38,628 --> 01:38:40,998
Yeah, you handle the farming.
I'll handle the mining.

1378
01:38:41,330 --> 01:38:43,167
- You lazy bastard.
- Oh.

1379
01:38:44,467 --> 01:38:46,267
I'm going to go shoot,
you want to come?

1380
01:38:46,269 --> 01:38:47,338
No, I'm good.

1381
01:38:47,803 --> 01:38:49,405
I'm going to head down
to the city.

1382
01:38:50,539 --> 01:38:53,444
"I'm going to head
to the city." City?

1383
01:38:55,544 --> 01:38:56,547
Wait.

1384
01:38:58,547 --> 01:38:59,482
Oh.

1385
01:39:00,449 --> 01:39:02,318
[laughing]

1386
01:39:03,386 --> 01:39:05,254
- Shut up.
- Why not?

1387
01:39:07,390 --> 01:39:09,624
- Remember your manners.
- [exclaims]

1388
01:39:09,626 --> 01:39:10,694
Hell yeah.

1389
01:39:16,732 --> 01:39:18,299
You have fun
on your date.

1390
01:39:18,301 --> 01:39:20,437
- Well, it's not a date.
- Yeah, sure it isn't.

1391
01:39:21,503 --> 01:39:23,506
Hey, I owe you one,
remember?

1392
01:39:31,580 --> 01:39:32,682
Hey, call me!

1393
01:39:33,182 --> 01:39:34,717
I'll be in the back
of your truck.
