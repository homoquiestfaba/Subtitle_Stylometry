<i> [boy] In case some of you
don't remember,</i>

00:00:14,912 --> 00:00:18,245

I've probably changed a litte</i>

3
00:00:18,312 --> 00:00:20,713
<i> since the last time
some of you saw me.</i>

4
00:00:20,778 --> 00:00:24,612
<i> A few years ago, I moved from
 sunny Hawaii to snowy Vermont.</i>

5
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:27,980
<i> Traded my surfboard for a
snowboard. But this week,</i>

6
00:00:28,047 --> 00:00:29,946
<i> if I'd have known
what was coming,</i>

7
00:00:30,013 --> 00:00:31,680
<i> what a wild ride it would be,</i>

8
00:00:31,746 --> 00:00:34,447
<i> I might have just
stayed on the mountain.</i>

9
00:00:45,015 --> 00:00:47,814
Whoa! Whoa!

10
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,149
No! No! No!

00:01:02,448 --> 00:01:04,983
[continues screaming]

00:01:08,283 --> 00:01:09,683
Whoa!

00:01:11,082 --> 00:01:13,251
Whoa!

Whoa!

00:01:25,317 --> 00:01:27,051
<i> [man] Johnny. Johnny.</i>

[gasps, sighs]

18
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:32,952
- You OK?
- Yup.

19
00:01:33,918 --> 00:01:35,751
Gnarly dream.

20
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:38,620
- How does it feel
to be back in Hawaii?
- Awesome.

21
00:01:38,686 --> 00:01:42,086
- Like we've been away forever.
- Never thought we'd come back

22
00:01:42,153 --> 00:01:44,153
to see my father get,
you know...

23
00:01:44,218 --> 00:01:46,652
Hitched? Tied down? Hooked up?

24
00:01:46,718 --> 00:01:49,420
- How about just "married?"
- [sighs]

25
00:01:49,487 --> 00:01:52,721
- Are you OK with this, Dad?
- No. Yeah, I'm good.

26
00:01:52,787 --> 00:01:55,920
It's because we haven't met
Grandpa's squeeze yet, isn't i?

27
00:01:55,987 --> 00:02:00,421
- Her name is Carla.
- No, that's not it.

28
00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:02,655
This is about Carla's son,
isn't it?

29
00:02:02,721 --> 00:02:05,021
Well, don't you think
it's just a little strange?

30
00:02:05,087 --> 00:02:09,288
I've always been an only child
and now, what's his name, Chri?

31
00:02:09,354 --> 00:02:11,423
Dad hasn't said
two words about him.

32
00:02:11,487 --> 00:02:13,921
I think it's nice that Johnny's
gonna have an uncle.

33
00:02:15,256 --> 00:02:17,955
Dad, this isn't the way
to Grandpa's house.

34
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:20,355
We're gonna stay in the city
for a couple of days.

35
00:02:20,421 --> 00:02:21,823
Your dad has a
business meeting

36
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:24,689
and, uh, I wanna
buy some summer clothes.

37
00:02:24,756 --> 00:02:27,590
OK, well, how am I
supposed to get there?

38
00:02:27,657 --> 00:02:31,324
[father] We arranged a ride
with a friend of ours.

39
00:02:33,556 --> 00:02:37,923
- [mother chuckles]
- What up?

40
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,257
Sam!

41
00:02:40,324 --> 00:02:43,224
Sam. Ah! What's up, man?

42
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,125
- [both grunting]
- Yeah!

43
00:02:45,192 --> 00:02:47,225
- You gonna be OK, Johnny?
- How's it, bro?

44
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,957
I'm good, man. Better,
now that my boy is here!

45
00:02:50,025 --> 00:02:54,092
- I think he'll be fine.
- [Sam] You got ugly on me, ma.

46
00:02:54,158 --> 00:02:56,258
- See you at Grandpa's.
- You look good, bro.

47
00:02:56,325 --> 00:02:57,393
Thanks, man!

00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:16,728
Aloha, sun!

50
00:03:16,794 --> 00:03:20,460
- Aloha, palm trees!
- Yo, yo. Chill, bro.

51
00:03:20,527 --> 00:03:23,727
I mean, I'm the one that's
been in Iceland for
four years, remember?

52
00:03:23,794 --> 00:03:25,761
- Yeah.
- I should be the one saying...

53
00:03:25,828 --> 00:03:29,262
<i>Oh,  mahalo , Hawaii. [laugh]</i>

54
00:03:29,328 --> 00:03:32,829
- Hey, hey, hey,
eyes front, junior!
- I got it.

55
00:03:32,895 --> 00:03:36,829
Whew! Man, I still can't
believe you live here.

56
00:03:36,895 --> 00:03:39,329
[Sam] Yeah. I thought it
was a joke when Dad told me

57
00:03:39,396 --> 00:03:42,662
he was transferred here to
Hickam. Whoa, bro, check it ou.

58

[rock music plays]

59
00:04:06,865 --> 00:04:09,799
- You saw that, right?
- Uh, yeah.

60
00:04:12,365 --> 00:04:15,299
[Johnny laughs]
All right, man.

61
00:04:16,565 --> 00:04:19,631
- All right, thanks for this.
- All right, OK.

62
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:21,799
- Tell your grandpa I said hi.
- You got it.

63
00:04:21,865 --> 00:04:24,300
- All right, man. Push out.
- Later.

64
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,634
Grandpa?

65
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,533
Right on. Surf's up.

66
00:04:56,935 --> 00:04:58,402
What is this?

67
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,871
[grunts]

68
00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:14,004
Whoa! Ah!

00:05:16,137 --> 00:05:19,204
Hey! [grunts]

70
00:05:22,603 --> 00:05:25,237
I told you, this is stupid!

71
00:05:25,305 --> 00:05:27,971
- I don't want to surf!
- Hey!

72
00:05:33,072 --> 00:05:34,272
Hey, Grandpa!

73
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:42,007
Hey, Pono! [laughs]

74
00:05:42,072 --> 00:05:43,939
What's up?

75
00:05:44,007 --> 00:05:47,173
Hey, how are you, Pono?

76
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,341
- Nice haircut!
Kinda short, huh?
- [laughs] Yeah.

77
00:05:51,406 --> 00:05:54,539
Whoa! [laughs]
I never thought I'd see that.

78
00:05:54,607 --> 00:05:57,075
Well,
let me tell you, Pono,

79
00:05:57,141 --> 00:05:59,007
there are plenty of changes
around here.

80
00:05:59,074 --> 00:06:02,840
- Like you giving surf lessons?
- Ah, only to tourists.

81
00:06:02,906 --> 00:06:06,008
- Why, you need one?
- Who you callin' a tourist?

82
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,109
[both laugh]

83
00:06:09,442 --> 00:06:13,108
- Hey, you got a visitor.
- Oh, no, that's not a visitor.

84
00:06:13,175 --> 00:06:17,141
That's my Carla, Pono. [laughs]
You ready for this?

85
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:19,875
If you love her, Grandpa,
I know I'll love her.

86
00:06:19,942 --> 00:06:22,377
- That's my grandson.
- [chuckles]

87
00:06:22,442 --> 00:06:24,910
- [laughs] Hey.
- Hey.

88
00:06:24,976 --> 00:06:27,075
- Carla, this is Johnny.
- Nice to meet you.

89
00:06:27,142 --> 00:06:31,676
Oh, give me a hug!
I have heard so much about you!

90
00:06:31,744 --> 00:06:33,810
- Great to meet you.
- It's good to meet you too.

91
00:06:33,877 --> 00:06:37,043
- Should we go inside?
I made dinner.
- Yes!

92
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,010
[Carla] Where's Chris?
I thought he was with you.

93
00:06:40,076 --> 00:06:43,511
Hey, he'll be here.
He's hungry.

94
00:06:43,576 --> 00:06:47,677
- Mmm, I smell
Huli Huli chicken.
- [Grandpa] Your favorite.

95
00:06:47,745 --> 00:06:51,745
I'll have you know it was
the first Hawaiian dish

96
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:53,379
that I learned to make.

97
00:06:53,444 --> 00:06:56,611
Oh, hey, Johnny, um,
about your room.

98
00:06:56,678 --> 00:06:59,179
Um, the house that
I'm renting down the beach

99
00:06:59,247 --> 00:07:02,879
ended up being small, so Chris
stays here. Hope that's OK.

100
00:07:02,946 --> 00:07:06,014
Totally cool. You know,
I can't wait to meet him.

101
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:09,147
Never had an uncle.
He might not want to
hang around with a teenager,

102
00:07:09,213 --> 00:07:11,014
but I've always
related well to adults.

103
00:07:11,081 --> 00:07:13,013
- [footsteps approaching]
- Uh, Johnny...

104
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,813
- What?
- [Grandpa] There's, uh...

105
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,514
- No.
- That's my Chris.

106
00:07:22,581 --> 00:07:26,181
[door slams]

107
00:07:26,247 --> 00:07:29,615
- Your new uncle.
- [objects clattering
and banging]

108

- [video game sound effects]
- [knock on door]

109
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:33,516
Hey, Chris.

110
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:39,016
- This is Johnny.
- Hey.

111
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:42,717
- This, uh, used to be his roo.
- Yup.

112
00:07:42,783 --> 00:07:46,283
Yeah, well, uh, he can have it.
It smells like fish.

113
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:50,983
Dude, that's just the salt air,
or... it might actually be fis.

114
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,617
[laughs] I used to bring
buckets of stuff in here.

115
00:07:53,684 --> 00:07:56,084
Mom thought it was gross,
but Grandpa was cool.

116
00:07:56,151 --> 00:07:58,317
[laughs] Yeah.

117
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,850
Well, Chris had his
first surfing lesson today.

118
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:05,518
- Yeah, that's right.
That was, um...
- Lame.

119
00:08:05,584 --> 00:08:09,717
I was gonna say cool, but,
um, dude, I totally understand.

120
00:08:09,785 --> 00:08:12,585
When I was first learning,
I wiped out constantly.

121
00:08:12,651 --> 00:08:14,718
[both laugh]

122
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:17,853
- Well, Chris is
gonna surf just fine.
- Yeah.

123
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:19,887
He just needs practice.
Right, Chris?

124
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,187
OK.

125
00:08:31,586 --> 00:08:33,120
[sighs]

126
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,388
[Grandpa] Oh, unreal, huh?

127
00:08:38,453 --> 00:08:42,387
We don't got waves like this in
Vermont, I tell you that much.

128
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:45,687
- Chris is a real
challenge, huh?
- Uh-huh.

129
00:08:45,754 --> 00:08:48,587
[laughs] Come on, Pono,
you can say it.

130
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,754
Look, I'm sure Chris is totally
cool once you get to know him.

131
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:54,221
Yeah.

132
00:08:54,288 --> 00:08:57,555
Thanks for coming, Pono.
It's the biggest day of my lif,

133
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:59,423
and you being here
made it bigger.

134
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:01,490
I wouldn't miss it
for anything.

135
00:09:01,557 --> 00:09:05,090
- [both laugh]
- Oh, Houston on the outside!

136
00:09:05,155 --> 00:09:07,322
- Oh, drop in, drop in.
- Whoa!

137
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:11,157
- [laughing]
- Some things never change, eh?

138
00:09:11,224 --> 00:09:13,458
[laughing]

139
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,292
- Pono.
- Hey.

140
00:09:21,357 --> 00:09:25,857
- So we hitting Sunset?
- Ah, nah.

141
00:09:25,923 --> 00:09:29,192
- No time for surf today.
- Rewind.

142
00:09:29,258 --> 00:09:32,358
I heard you just say something
crazy like no time for surfing.

143
00:09:32,424 --> 00:09:34,692
Yeah. Come.

144
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:38,060
I wanna show you why
Carla and Chris came to Oahu.

145
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:48,860
This is why
they came to Hawaii?

146
00:09:48,926 --> 00:09:50,227
Carla's father
owned this shop.

147
00:09:50,293 --> 00:09:54,760
- When he passed away,
he left it to her.
- OK.

148
00:09:54,826 --> 00:09:57,961
And, uh, I'm going
to help her get it going.

149
00:09:58,027 --> 00:10:00,427
[laughs] Wow.

150
00:10:00,495 --> 00:10:03,361
- You're gonna run a shop?
- Don't look so surprised, Pon.

151
00:10:05,427 --> 00:10:09,528
- [bell jingles]
- Ta-da! Whoo-hoo!

152
00:10:09,595 --> 00:10:11,896
So this is where
old surfboards go to die.

153
00:10:11,961 --> 00:10:14,129
- What you think, Pono?
- It's, um...

154
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:17,062
- ...um... It's nice.
- [Carla] Hey.

155
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:20,663
- Hey!
- The cavalry's here.
[laughs] Hey.

156
00:10:21,596 --> 00:10:23,029
- Hey, Johnny.
- Hey.

157
00:10:23,096 --> 00:10:25,663
So, uh, where's Chris?
I thought he was with you.

158
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:29,297
Oh, no. He's, uh, across the
street with his, uh, friends.

159
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:31,963
- [Grandpa] OK.
- [Carla] Yeah.

160
00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:35,163
So, Pono, I got plenty of work
for you to do around here.

161
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,797
Whatever you need, Grandpa.

162
00:10:36,863 --> 00:10:41,999
- Well, um, there's one thing..
- Sure. No problem.

163
00:10:42,063 --> 00:10:46,365
- Thanks, eh.
- I'd love to baby-sit my uncl.

164
00:10:46,431 --> 00:10:48,132
[rock music plays]

165
00:11:04,032 --> 00:11:07,766
Oh, look, Chrissy.
Here comes the nephew.

166
00:11:07,832 --> 00:11:10,100
[sighs] Great.

167
00:11:15,932 --> 00:11:20,034
- [Johnny] Hey. How's it, brah?
- Great.

168
00:11:22,402 --> 00:11:25,001
- I'm Johnny.
- Jared.

169
00:11:25,067 --> 00:11:27,934
This is Bo,
Spidey and Rooster.

170
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:32,235
I'm Val.

171
00:11:33,001 --> 00:11:37,535
- Hey.
- Hey.

172
00:11:37,602 --> 00:11:39,769
That's, um,
a dirt-board, right?

173
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,602
Some people call it
a mountain-board.

174
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:44,836
- Do you ride?
- He surfs.

175
00:11:44,903 --> 00:11:47,403
Wow, that's so
Hawaiian of you.

176
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,537
You live here, right?

177
00:11:48,604 --> 00:11:52,738
For now, yeah.
Tomorrow, who knows?

178
00:11:53,903 --> 00:11:56,203
OK. I get it.

179
00:11:56,269 --> 00:11:59,703
You're all from the Mainland
and you all don't like surfing,

180
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:03,771
and you all get your matching
outfits at Dirt Devils, huh?

181
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:09,472
They bring the dirt
and I supply the devil.

182
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:14,837
[laughs] Aw, man.

183
00:12:14,904 --> 00:12:17,405
Look, I'm kiddin', bro.

184
00:12:17,472 --> 00:12:21,405
Come on inside and see what
everyone's been talkin' about.

185
00:12:21,471 --> 00:12:23,173
Sure. Why not?

186
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,673
Oh, this is all
state-of-the-art gear.

187
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:34,874
On this side we got dirt decks,
all-terrain trucks, suspension,

188
00:12:34,941 --> 00:12:38,841
helmets, leathers.
Spidey, do not touch that.

189
00:12:38,907 --> 00:12:41,141
And over here
it's all street.

190
00:12:41,207 --> 00:12:44,908
You got your, uh,
custom decks, suspension...

191
00:12:44,974 --> 00:12:47,342
Oh, man, out the back,

192
00:12:47,408 --> 00:12:50,575
we do the sickest taping
this side of Carlsbad.

193
00:12:50,642 --> 00:12:53,575
There's nothing but the best
for my crew, huh? Am I right?

194
00:12:53,642 --> 00:12:54,943
- Yeah.
- Yeah, right.

195
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:57,242
Yeah, this stuff is,
uh, it's pretty sweet.

196
00:12:57,308 --> 00:13:00,742
Yeah, well, Troy is the
godfather of dirt-boarding.

197
00:13:00,808 --> 00:13:03,208
He's gonna help us get sponsors
so we can do a tour.

198
00:13:03,275 --> 00:13:06,075
We can get off this rock and
make the world our dirt pile.

199
00:13:06,143 --> 00:13:08,543
- You ever ride?
- Well, I skate back in Vermon.

200
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,475
Here, it's all
about North Shore.

201
00:13:10,543 --> 00:13:13,376
Well, then the answer
would be, uh, "No."

202
00:13:13,443 --> 00:13:15,211
Carving rock is gnarly, dude.

203
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:18,210
When you stack,
you don't float.

204
00:13:18,277 --> 00:13:20,878
- You bleed.
- OK, I think he gets the poin.

205
00:13:20,943 --> 00:13:24,177
We were gonna hit some trails
we found west of Cloud Break,

206
00:13:24,245 --> 00:13:27,144
- so you could come with us.
- No, Johnny can't come

207
00:13:27,211 --> 00:13:29,912
because he has
stuff to do, right?

208
00:13:29,979 --> 00:13:34,579
Actually, I'd be down to give t
a try. I'll need a board.

209
00:13:34,644 --> 00:13:36,812
- Cool.
- Yeah.

210
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:41,480
- Rental's on the house.
- And a helmet. And pads.

211
00:13:41,546 --> 00:13:44,713
Oh, of course.
Yeah! Safety first, right?

212
00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:47,179
- [all] Yeah.
- Right.

213
00:13:47,246 --> 00:13:48,613
Whoo-hoo!

214
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:52,380
Whoa! [chuckles]

215
00:13:55,614 --> 00:13:57,115
Yeah!

216
00:14:02,682 --> 00:14:04,715
That was tough!

217
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:26,451
That was crazy!

218
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,285
I don't think we should be her.

219
00:14:51,385 --> 00:14:53,785
The only one who
shouldn't be here is you.

220
00:14:55,885 --> 00:14:59,552
These guys, they're not
your friends, are they?

221
00:14:59,619 --> 00:15:01,918
You need to shut up.

222
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:04,086
All right? We're friends.

223
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,519
I'm sure you'd
like them to be.

224
00:15:09,187 --> 00:15:11,254
You don't have the uniform.

225
00:15:11,321 --> 00:15:14,388
- You're not a Dirt Devil yet.
- I will be.

226
00:15:15,888 --> 00:15:19,488
Right. When you prove
you're good enough.

227
00:15:19,553 --> 00:15:20,953
So prove it.

228
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,822
[rock music plays]

229
00:15:31,955 --> 00:15:34,123
Whoa! Whoa!

230
00:15:38,121 --> 00:15:39,889
Whoa! Whoa!

231
00:15:40,623 --> 00:15:42,123
[grunts]

232
00:15:43,056 --> 00:15:45,757
[laughs]

233
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,257
[Val] Johnny.

234
00:15:51,023 --> 00:15:55,456
- Here.
- Whoa. Deja vu.

235
00:15:55,524 --> 00:15:57,823
- Yeah, are you OK?
- Yeah, no, I'm cool.

236
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,224
Man, you can't stop
this thing like a snowboard.

237
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,058
Brah, you are awesome!

238
00:16:02,124 --> 00:16:05,892
Compared to what?
Johnny "Who-nami?" [laughs]

239
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:12,892
Yeah. Kid,
that was a nice try, C,

240
00:16:12,957 --> 00:16:16,525
but you know what you gotta do
to be one of us.

241
00:16:16,592 --> 00:16:20,458
You gotta impress Troy.
And to impress Troy,

242
00:16:20,524 --> 00:16:23,427
you gotta impress me first. OK?

243
00:16:23,494 --> 00:16:27,293
So I think that you
should ride the Toilet Bowl.

244
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,026
- [laughter]
- Jared...

245
00:16:29,092 --> 00:16:32,892
Val, chill. Thanks.

246
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,461
You want the gear, right? Yeah?
You gotta face the fear.

247
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,394
[laughter]

248
00:16:43,427 --> 00:16:45,294
[Jared] Come on,
you can do it.

249
00:16:45,361 --> 00:16:46,928
[Spider] What are you
waiting for?

250
00:16:46,995 --> 00:16:48,528
[Jared] Get in there.
Come on.

251
00:16:48,596 --> 00:16:51,961
- Chris, can you do this?
- I don't know.

252
00:16:52,028 --> 00:16:54,729
- [Jared] Do it.
- Bail then.

253
00:16:54,794 --> 00:16:56,527
No shame in backing off
a sketchy run.

254
00:16:56,595 --> 00:16:57,995
The pros do it all the time.

255
00:16:58,062 --> 00:17:01,696
- You scared, C?
- Mommy! Hold me!

256
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:05,962
- You'll never do it, C.
- Little chicken! [clucking]

257
00:17:06,029 --> 00:17:08,864
- Scaredy-cat!
- Wait, dude.

258
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,698
- Chris.
- [siren bleeps]

259
00:17:14,765 --> 00:17:18,331
[over megaphone]
You're trespassing on
private property. Bring it in.

260
00:17:18,397 --> 00:17:22,432
- Right now.
- [siren wails]

261
00:17:22,498 --> 00:17:27,498
- Johnny T. How's it, brah?
- Officer Oki, how's it going?

262
00:17:27,565 --> 00:17:29,465
Double overhead
at Rocky Point, eh?

263
00:17:29,531 --> 00:17:31,064
Yeah, I'm gonna try to catch

264
00:17:31,132 --> 00:17:34,498
the glass-off later, so...
Hey, I got something for you.

265
00:17:34,565 --> 00:17:36,766
What's going on?

266
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:41,432
I found these two ripping up
some private property on this.

267
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,432
It was my idea.
I asked Chris to teach me.

268
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,500
- I guess I chose
the wrong spot.
- What were you thinking?

269
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,601
So, what's it gonna be,
Officer Oki?

270
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:52,332
Well, this is
Chris' second warning.

271
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,901
Next time, it's wikiwiki
to the juvie judge.

272
00:17:55,968 --> 00:17:58,335
Inside with me.
Come on. Right now.

273
00:18:06,468 --> 00:18:08,836
You know,
I would have been outta th.

274
00:18:08,902 --> 00:18:12,668
- Face planted
at the bottom, brah.
- Brah?

275
00:18:12,734 --> 00:18:15,735
Do me a favor and just stop
calling me that, all right?

276
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,269
I'm not your brah,
your bro,

277
00:18:18,336 --> 00:18:20,702
or any other part
of your family.

278
00:18:28,336 --> 00:18:32,436
So Chris, uh, we talked about
what happened today.

279
00:18:32,503 --> 00:18:35,803
Johnny knows, uh, I'm not
into this punishment thing.

280
00:18:37,136 --> 00:18:40,637
When his dad was your age,
we disagreed.

281
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:44,204
But I believed that in time
he'd find his own path.

282
00:18:44,271 --> 00:18:47,038
I believe in you too, Chris.

283
00:18:47,105 --> 00:18:52,471
This path you're on
right now... it's dangerous.

284
00:18:52,538 --> 00:18:56,471
So we've, um... we've decided
to take away your wheels.

285
00:18:56,538 --> 00:18:58,373
No more dirt-boarding
for the week.

286
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,640
- But, Mom...
- No, no "buts."

287
00:19:00,705 --> 00:19:04,572
What about him?
He said that it was his idea!

288
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,907
You know what, Chris?
I don't want to hear it, OK? G.

289
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,974
[Chris] Great job, brah.

290
00:19:18,406 --> 00:19:21,840
Grandpa, I'm sorry.

291
00:19:21,906 --> 00:19:25,708
Yeah, well, I appreciate
what you tried to do. I do.

292
00:19:25,775 --> 00:19:27,675
I just wish it would've
turned out better.

293
00:19:27,741 --> 00:19:28,942
You OK, Grandpa?

294
00:19:31,442 --> 00:19:34,741
I never told you, if we
don't open the shop in time,

295
00:19:34,808 --> 00:19:38,710
generate some cash right away,
Carla may lose everything.

296
00:19:38,776 --> 00:19:41,276
Well, is there anything
that can I do?

297
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,676
- Chris.
- I know he's kind of...

298
00:19:47,742 --> 00:19:50,909
Angry? Bitter?
A pain in the...?

299
00:19:50,976 --> 00:19:52,844
Pono, look.

300
00:19:52,911 --> 00:19:56,644
Please, for me, just keep him
out of trouble till Saturday.

301
00:20:01,444 --> 00:20:04,644
- Dude, where's your board?
- I can't go surfing.

302
00:20:04,711 --> 00:20:06,612
- Quick. Get in the car!
- Why?

303
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:10,345
Uh, 'cause I'm taking you to te
hospital. You've gotta be sick.

304
00:20:10,412 --> 00:20:12,179
Uncle doesn't surf.

305
00:20:14,345 --> 00:20:16,980
- Chris, Sam. Sam, Chris.
- What's up, Chris?

306
00:20:17,045 --> 00:20:18,513
Whatever.

307
00:20:22,811 --> 00:20:24,346
Look, bro, all I'm saying

308
00:20:24,413 --> 00:20:27,212
is your grandpa doesn't
seem like the business type.

309
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:30,279
He isn't. Wasn't.

310
00:20:30,346 --> 00:20:33,013
The place is gonna
crash and burn.

311
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,214
Hello? Anybody here?

312
00:20:38,248 --> 00:20:40,515
Weird. Grandpa's car's
out front.

313
00:20:40,582 --> 00:20:42,781
Maybe he went to
the barbershop for a trim.

314
00:20:42,847 --> 00:20:45,249
[laughs] Yeah, right.

315
00:20:45,316 --> 00:20:47,382
- You're kidding?
- Not really.

316
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:51,915
"Gone to the barbershop
for a trim."

317
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,781
[laughs] Well,
I'm gonna go ask him

318
00:20:54,848 --> 00:20:56,115
to see what he
wants us to do first.

319
00:20:56,182 --> 00:21:00,316
- Um, keep an eye on him for m?
- Gotcha, bro.

320
00:21:00,383 --> 00:21:04,316
- You don't have to watch me.
- Right.

321
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,283
[laughs]

322
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:16,483
- [Grandpa] Hey, brother.
How's it?
- Sorry.

323
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:19,683
- Hey, Pono!
- Grandpa?

324
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,417
So, what you think, Pono?
Crazy, huh?

325
00:21:22,484 --> 00:21:24,817
Uh, yeah,
you could say that.

326
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:27,485
Gonna meet Carla at the bank.
Where's Chris?

327
00:21:27,551 --> 00:21:30,651
- He's back at
the shop with Sam.
- Oh, late.

328
00:21:30,718 --> 00:21:33,552
You're wearing a watch?
You never wear a watch.

329
00:21:33,618 --> 00:21:36,653
Not since... Wish me luck. We'l
tell you about it later, eh?

330
00:21:37,586 --> 00:21:38,720
All right.

331
00:21:41,353 --> 00:21:44,054
- Hey, Carla.
- Hey.

332
00:21:56,619 --> 00:22:00,687
Whoa, bro. I haven't
seen that look since the...

333
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:03,187
Come to think of it,
I've never seen that look.

334
00:22:03,253 --> 00:22:05,587
- What's going on?
- I saw my grandpa.

335
00:22:05,654 --> 00:22:08,588
- Yeah, so?
- He was wearing a suit.

336
00:22:08,654 --> 00:22:11,388
[laughs] Don't joke
about something like that.

337
00:22:11,454 --> 00:22:12,556
Hey, where's Chris?

338
00:22:17,122 --> 00:22:20,056
[indistinct chatter]

339
00:22:20,123 --> 00:22:24,056
He isn't skating and he's not
doing anything illegal, so...

340
00:22:24,123 --> 00:22:26,088
We need to
help Grandpa with this.

341
00:22:26,155 --> 00:22:28,790
- Guess we'll call it
volunteer work.
- Cool. Thanks, man.

342
00:22:28,857 --> 00:22:30,756
- No, it's cool.
- All right.

343
00:22:30,824 --> 00:22:33,291
So let's see
what we got here...

344
00:22:33,357 --> 00:22:36,557
[laughs] Man,
do I love summertime.

345
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,923
- Best time of the year.
- [mother] I'll take that.

346
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:42,891
Mom! Um, dad?
You guys came back early.

347
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:46,591
Yeah, well, your grandfather
called. He sounded strange.

348
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:47,990
You should see how he looks.

349
00:22:48,057 --> 00:22:49,759
- Looks?
- Never mind.

350
00:22:49,824 --> 00:22:52,425
- We're here to help.
- Good. There's all this stuff

351
00:22:52,491 --> 00:22:54,759
to put on the racks
and no one surfs anymore.

352
00:22:54,825 --> 00:22:57,424
I'm supposed to take care
of my new uncle-to-be who,

353
00:22:57,491 --> 00:23:00,326
you probably know by now,
is 12 and a punk...

354
00:23:00,393 --> 00:23:02,393
- Johnny. Breathe.
- [Sam] Listen.

355
00:23:02,459 --> 00:23:04,860
I got the DSL up, but the
wireless router's jacked.

356
00:23:04,926 --> 00:23:06,558
There's tons of
software to load...

357
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:08,693
Come on, Sam.
Take it easy.

358
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:11,227
- [Sam] Nothing I can do...
- Calm down. Take a break.

359
00:23:11,294 --> 00:23:15,294
- We'll handle
the computer and the...
- Merchandise?

360
00:23:15,361 --> 00:23:17,094
Right.

361
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,827
You two go have...
Well, have some fun.

362
00:23:19,894 --> 00:23:23,661
- All right. I love my parents.
- [Sam] Yeah, me too.

363
00:23:23,728 --> 00:23:26,094
All right, got the wax
'cause you always forget.

364
00:23:26,161 --> 00:23:28,828
- I know, bro.
- Let's get my board
and go surf.

365
00:23:28,894 --> 00:23:31,394
Whoa, bro.
Where's Chris going?

366
00:23:31,461 --> 00:23:33,894
[engine starts]

367
00:23:33,961 --> 00:23:35,929
[car doors slamming]

368
00:23:39,395 --> 00:23:41,430
Chris, hold on!

369
00:23:43,729 --> 00:23:44,896
We gotta go after him.

370
00:23:44,963 --> 00:23:46,230
- You sure?
- Yes.

371
00:23:46,296 --> 00:23:48,564
Maybe you'll get lucky
and they won't give him back.

372
00:23:48,631 --> 00:23:50,596
I promised I'd keep
Chris out of trouble.

373
00:23:50,663 --> 00:23:52,096
This looks like trouble.

374
00:23:58,298 --> 00:24:01,365
[indistinct chattering]

375
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:08,464
- Hey, Troy.
- Yeah.

376
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:10,432
What, uh...
What we doin' here?

377
00:24:10,499 --> 00:24:17,298
Well, I'm leaving and they're
gonna... do what they do.

378
00:24:17,365 --> 00:24:19,900
- Chris isn't allowed to skate.
- As I understand it,

379
00:24:19,965 --> 00:24:24,198
he's not allowed to, uh,
dirt-board. [laughs] Come on.

380
00:24:24,266 --> 00:24:27,200
It's cool. Val heard
that Chris couldn't ride dirt,

381
00:24:27,267 --> 00:24:30,868
so I set up this little street
course on my buddy's barge.

382
00:24:35,567 --> 00:24:37,999
Hey, uh, Johnny?

383
00:24:38,667 --> 00:24:41,133
Look, I'm on Chris's side.

384
00:24:41,201 --> 00:24:43,500
I know how much skating
means to these kids.

385
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:46,533
They really stick together.
You take Rooster, for instance.

386
00:24:46,601 --> 00:24:48,235
He's from Montana.
He came here.

387
00:24:48,301 --> 00:24:50,836
He doesn't surf,
he had no friends,

388
00:24:50,902 --> 00:24:53,736
then he found the Dirt Devils.
And Chris, well, I was just

389
00:24:53,803 --> 00:24:57,036
telling him he might be
almost ready to wear the logo.

390
00:24:57,102 --> 00:25:00,336
Oh, really? Did he do
something impressive?

391
00:25:00,403 --> 00:25:01,970
I hear you have to be impresse.

392
00:25:02,036 --> 00:25:05,703
[laughs] Man, Jared just says
that to scare off the posers.

393
00:25:10,104 --> 00:25:12,604
Look, man,
Chris is 12.

394
00:25:12,671 --> 00:25:14,270
His mom doesn't
even know he's here.

395
00:25:14,337 --> 00:25:18,171
He'll be fine, bro. I mean,
isn't that why you're here?

396
00:25:20,971 --> 00:25:22,805
[engine starts]

397
00:25:24,003 --> 00:25:25,304
I don't get that kid.

398
00:25:27,404 --> 00:25:30,806
I mean, he knows that everyones
stressing this week, you know?

399
00:25:30,872 --> 00:25:35,205
With the shop and the wedding?
Now he's pullin' this.

400
00:25:35,271 --> 00:25:37,271
Maybe it's his way
of dealing, bro.

401
00:25:37,338 --> 00:25:41,105
I mean, it ain't easy
to move to a new place.

402
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:43,806
And it can't be easy
to suddenly have a new parent.

403
00:25:43,873 --> 00:25:46,673
All I'm sayin' is you know
Chris is going through things

404
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:50,440
that you did when you
moved to Vermont. All right?

405
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:53,474
- Yeah, yeah. You're right.
- So what'd you do back then

406
00:25:53,539 --> 00:25:56,141
- to feel better?
- Hung out with you.

407
00:25:56,208 --> 00:25:58,641
That's what I'm talking about.
Yeah, and we became boys

408
00:25:58,707 --> 00:26:01,608
'cause we loved riding boards
more than anything else.

409
00:26:01,674 --> 00:26:03,908
No doubt. No doubt.

410
00:26:03,973 --> 00:26:06,908
[sighs] All right,
let's go make friends.

411
00:26:06,974 --> 00:26:09,507
That's what I'm talking about.
You on the right page.

Hey, Chris!

00:26:14,108 --> 00:26:17,208
- What's up, man?
- What are you guys doing here?

415
00:26:17,276 --> 00:26:21,210
Hangin' out. Skating.
If that's OK with you.

416
00:26:23,942 --> 00:26:28,109
- So surfer boy's gonna drop i.
- Yeah.

417
00:26:28,176 --> 00:26:32,442
- Yeah? You sure you can hang?
- Go big or go home, right?

418
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:35,210
- You know it.
- You ever actually
skated like this?

419
00:26:35,277 --> 00:26:38,910
- It's not exactly cruising.
- Hmm. I don't know.

420
00:26:38,977 --> 00:26:43,178
- You think we can handle it?
- Yeah, I don't know, bro.

421
00:26:43,244 --> 00:26:47,245
- Looks pretty gnarly.
- [laughter]

422

If we stack, we quit. Deal?

He's your nephew.

I really did.

Chris just doesn't like me.

Ah, Pono,
it's not that.

once, back in California.

00:49:31,557 --> 00:49:33,059
- OK!
- Guys!

823
00:49:33,126 --> 00:49:35,093
Chris! Chris!

824
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:41,093
<i> [announcer] Akoni Kama!</i>

825
00:49:41,159 --> 00:49:43,193
He's got brown hair...

826
00:49:53,492 --> 00:49:55,793
<i> [announcer] Oh, yeah!
Way to punch it!</i>

827
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,993
I'm just saying,
call me anytime you want.

828
00:49:58,061 --> 00:50:00,028
- I'm sorry.
- Whatever.

829
00:50:07,195 --> 00:50:10,429
<i> [announcer] Tony Cabo
with the nice back flip!</i>

830
00:50:10,494 --> 00:50:13,496
Excuse me, have you
seen a kid about this tall?

831
00:50:21,063 --> 00:50:24,631
<i> [announcer] Oh, backside
fakey 180 from Leon.</i>

832
00:50:29,496 --> 00:50:32,830
<i> [announcer] Trick, ladies and
gentlemen. 360 indie grab.</i>

833
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:40,097
<i> Backside 360 double grab.</i>

834
00:50:40,164 --> 00:50:43,496
<i> Whoa! Massive one-footer.</i>

835
00:50:43,563 --> 00:50:45,598
Good ride, man.

836
00:50:45,666 --> 00:50:47,898
<i> [announcer]
That's Akoni Kama.</i>

837
00:50:47,965 --> 00:50:52,000
<i> Give him a big hand! He'll be
here all day signing autogra.</i>

838
00:50:59,865 --> 00:51:01,967
Grandpa? Yeah.

839
00:51:02,032 --> 00:51:04,532
We haven't... found him.

840
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:06,566
- I...
- Just back off!

841
00:51:06,632 --> 00:51:09,433
No, no! I actually...
I just found him!

842
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,766
Tell Carla not to worry.
I will bring him back.

843
00:51:11,833 --> 00:51:13,833
[Chris] I'm sick of this.
I've been working.

844
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,833
- You have not proven yourself!
- I haven't?

845
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:17,134
Hey, hey. Everybody chill.

846
00:51:17,201 --> 00:51:19,367
I'm way better than you!

847
00:51:19,434 --> 00:51:22,833
Listen, Barney. Maybe you
should take your training whees

848
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:25,801
and go home before you say
something really stupid.

849
00:51:25,869 --> 00:51:27,735
- Whoa, barney?
- That's not cool.

850
00:51:27,802 --> 00:51:30,336
I know your problem.
You're afraid to race me!

851
00:51:30,402 --> 00:51:31,901
Yes, Chris,
you caught me. I...

852
00:51:31,969 --> 00:51:34,601
I am afraid. I'm afraid
I'm going to die...

853
00:51:34,668 --> 00:51:37,702
- ...of boredom.
- A-ha! Classic.
You're gonna die...

854
00:51:37,768 --> 00:51:41,269
OK, uh,
the guys at ProBoards,

855
00:51:41,335 --> 00:51:44,735
they, um... They want
to meet the Dirt Devils!

856
00:51:44,802 --> 00:51:49,503
[cheering]

857
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:52,303
- Yes!
- All right, Dirt Devils.
Follow me.

858
00:51:52,369 --> 00:51:55,304
Hey, hey, Troy?
Troy. Troy, listen.

859
00:51:55,371 --> 00:51:57,104
Listen, I really
want to be on your crew.

860
00:51:57,170 --> 00:51:58,538
I'm... I'm ready.

861
00:51:58,605 --> 00:52:01,438
- Just give me a chance.
- Troy, Chris is really great.

862
00:52:01,503 --> 00:52:03,637
- Give him a chance.
- We gotta get back home.

863
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:06,138
Whatever you want, I'll do it.
I'll do it now.

864
00:52:06,204 --> 00:52:08,804
Oh, OK. Uh...

865
00:52:08,871 --> 00:52:13,472
Here's what I wanna see. I wana
see you tellin' your new dad

866
00:52:13,539 --> 00:52:17,406
if it's a board and it has
wheels, it sells at my shop.

867
00:52:17,472 --> 00:52:19,440
- Period.
- Yeah. OK, man. Whatever.

868
00:52:19,505 --> 00:52:21,440
- Just let me ride.
- Chris, we gotta jet.

869
00:52:21,507 --> 00:52:24,306
- Let me go.
- Jared's my team captain.

870
00:52:24,373 --> 00:52:27,472
He knows what it takes to be on
this team. If he says you're i,

871
00:52:27,539 --> 00:52:30,074
then you get to wear
the D-squared logo.

872
00:52:30,141 --> 00:52:33,374
You want to be a Devil, grom?
You gotta get air. Big air.

873
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,239
Not those baby bumps
you been ridin'.

874
00:52:35,306 --> 00:52:36,774
No problem.
Name the place.

875
00:52:37,574 --> 00:52:43,041
How about... Pupukea?

876
00:52:43,108 --> 00:52:45,442
The gap at the bottom
of the south trail.

877
00:52:45,509 --> 00:52:47,340
- When?
- Tomorrow. 3:00.

878
00:52:47,407 --> 00:52:48,875
Chris, come on.
Let's go.

879
00:52:52,641 --> 00:52:54,942
- I'm there.
- Can't wait.

880
00:52:56,242 --> 00:52:58,076
<i> [announcer] That's Akoni Kama.</i>

881
00:52:58,143 --> 00:53:01,175
<i> He'll be here
all day signing autographs.</i>

882
00:53:01,242 --> 00:53:03,576
He ran away
from home, John.

883
00:53:03,643 --> 00:53:05,376
He went to
hang with his friends,

884
00:53:05,443 --> 00:53:09,044
- and do what he loves.
- He took the bus! By himself!

885
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:11,644
Old lady tourists
take the bus around here.

886
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:14,644
That's not the point, OK?

887
00:53:23,512 --> 00:53:24,646
[sighs]

888
00:53:28,211 --> 00:53:31,612
As he gets older,
he's going to make mistakes.

889
00:53:31,677 --> 00:53:34,445
- He's gonna
do things he regrets.
- I know.

890
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:38,047
Sometimes he'll
need his mother.

891
00:53:39,846 --> 00:53:43,880
But right now, what he needs
most is to be part of somethin.

892
00:53:46,012 --> 00:53:47,581
To belong.

893
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:52,681
Ah, great.

894
00:53:58,914 --> 00:54:03,048
You know, they say that
if you're a pipeline surfer,

895
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:07,648
you're gonna get hurt. It's
not a matter of if, or when.

896
00:54:07,715 --> 00:54:11,416
- It's inevitable.
- You know, as usual,

897
00:54:11,483 --> 00:54:14,149
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

898
00:54:25,516 --> 00:54:28,682
Your mom and my grandpa.

899
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:31,250
They are
going to get married.

900
00:54:31,317 --> 00:54:35,083
Whether we like it or not,
it's gonna happen.

901
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:37,451
We are gonna be a family.

902
00:54:39,217 --> 00:54:43,285
So all this yelling and
slamming doors, running away,

903
00:54:43,351 --> 00:54:46,218
it's not gonna change anything.

904
00:54:46,284 --> 00:54:48,751
In the meantime, you're
making everyone miserable.

905
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:51,485
You know what?
You can leave me alone.

906
00:54:57,018 --> 00:54:59,552
You know, all I want...

907
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,386
All I want is for
my grandpa to be happy.

908
00:55:04,452 --> 00:55:06,253
And I think your mom
deserves the same.

909
00:55:08,954 --> 00:55:11,521
She seems like a really nice
person. That's all I'm saying.

910
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:14,921
Yeah, thanks.

911
00:55:14,987 --> 00:55:17,454
I'll always cherish this momen.

912
00:55:19,686 --> 00:55:21,221
Later, brah.

913
00:55:24,755 --> 00:55:26,389
Ooh! Oh...

914
00:55:28,088 --> 00:55:30,255
- [straining]
- There. No, back.

915
00:55:30,322 --> 00:55:31,655
- Back.
- [Grandpa] You sure?

916
00:55:31,721 --> 00:55:35,255
Yes. Back. That's it.

917
00:55:36,822 --> 00:55:38,722
Unless...

918
00:55:38,789 --> 00:55:40,990
You know
where we could put this?

919
00:55:42,755 --> 00:55:44,324
Right here.

920
00:55:44,822 --> 00:55:46,257
Perfect.

921
00:55:46,322 --> 00:55:48,923
- How's that checklist, Mel?
- Very checked, thank you.

922
00:55:48,989 --> 00:55:51,157
- Flowers finally came!
- Check.

923
00:55:51,224 --> 00:55:53,590
- Oh, music.
- Uh, check.

924
00:55:53,657 --> 00:55:55,856
- Thank you.
- [father] Hula dancers?

925
00:55:55,923 --> 00:55:59,490
- [Mel laughs] Double check.
- OK.

926
00:55:59,557 --> 00:56:02,891
Um, you do realize this
isn't even the actual wedding.

927
00:56:02,958 --> 00:56:04,758
It's just
the rehearsal dinner.

928
00:56:04,824 --> 00:56:07,025
Just wait till
you get married, Pono.

929
00:56:09,692 --> 00:56:12,492
Hey. Do I have to
worry about you today?

930
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:17,860
- No. No.
- Hey. You're my boy.

931
00:56:17,925 --> 00:56:19,826
Kiss me.

932
00:56:19,893 --> 00:56:22,760
- [Grandpa] Uh, Pete?
You ready to go?
- Yeah. Shoot.

933
00:56:22,826 --> 00:56:24,827
- Go where?
We still need muscle.
- What?

934
00:56:24,893 --> 00:56:26,393
Oh, don't worry.
We'll be back.

935
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:28,827
We just have a few, uh,
details to take care of.

936
00:56:28,893 --> 00:56:31,193
We'll be ready for the
grand opening tomorrow.

937
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:36,393
Grand opening in the morning,
wedding at night. Am I crazy?

938
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,061
A whole day
of new beginnings, Pono.

939
00:56:38,126 --> 00:56:40,527
- So what? You coming?
- Nah.

940
00:56:40,594 --> 00:56:45,262
Somebody's gotta stay behind
and... be the muscle.

941
00:56:45,329 --> 00:56:48,496
- Thank you.
- Don't rip your shirt, Rock.

942
00:56:48,561 --> 00:56:52,063
Very funny. And just
so you know, it's The Rock.

943
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:54,729
OK, The Rock.
We'll see you hula time, eh?

944
00:56:54,795 --> 00:56:56,729
[Johnny] All right.

945
00:56:56,795 --> 00:56:59,530
Hey, um, come on, man.
I need some help.

946
00:56:59,596 --> 00:57:01,096
Come on.

947
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:07,796
- All right, we'll look at...
- Hey, um, thanks.

948
00:57:07,862 --> 00:57:10,929
- For what?
- You know,
for not telling anyone

949
00:57:10,996 --> 00:57:15,563
- about the jump today.
- Oh, well, that was easy.

950
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:17,230
- Really?
- Yeah.

951
00:57:17,297 --> 00:57:20,131
- Because there isn't
gonna be any jump.
- Says you.

952
00:57:24,831 --> 00:57:28,464
- What's up?
- You see those
flower arrangements?

953
00:57:28,532 --> 00:57:30,465
- The stupid pineapple ones?
- Yeah.

954
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,199
My mom has spent
hours on them.

955
00:57:32,266 --> 00:57:35,398
My dad has set up
every chair and table here.

956
00:57:35,465 --> 00:57:37,965
- So?
- So for the next 24 hours,

957
00:57:38,032 --> 00:57:39,565
you and your
miserable little life

958
00:57:39,632 --> 00:57:41,465
consists of doing
whatever it takes

959
00:57:41,532 --> 00:57:44,632
to make this day special
for your mom and my grandpa,

960
00:57:44,699 --> 00:57:45,932
just like the rest of us.

961
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,365
- Or what?
- Trust me.
You don't want to know.

962
00:57:50,432 --> 00:57:53,266
- Johnny?
- You win. Fine.

963
00:57:53,333 --> 00:57:55,134
- Good.
- I need you to go into town

964
00:57:55,201 --> 00:57:57,701
and pick up things from
this list. Don't forget ice.

965
00:57:57,766 --> 00:58:00,999
[Johnny] Yeah, sure.
No problem.

966
00:58:00,068 --> 00:58:04,168
- Hey, um, can I come?
- Why do you want to come?

967
00:58:04,235 --> 00:58:07,536
I thought I'd help you out
with the ice bags.

968
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:12,168
- OK. Thanks.
- Yeah. Gotcha, bro.

969
00:58:12,235 --> 00:58:14,101
Just, uh,
wait for me in the car.

970
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:19,003
I'm impressed.
How'd you do that?

971
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:23,871
I, uh, guess I appealed to his
sense of self-preservation.

972
00:58:23,936 --> 00:58:26,736
OK. [laughs]
Seat belts.

973
00:58:26,802 --> 00:58:28,836
- All right. Bye, Mom.
- Seat belt!

974
00:58:41,637 --> 00:58:43,903
Hey, uh, gotta go
to the bathroom.

975
00:58:43,971 --> 00:58:45,737
Why didn't you go
before we left?

976
00:58:45,804 --> 00:58:47,873
Didn't have to go then.

977
00:58:47,938 --> 00:58:51,305
[sighs]
Well, all right.

978
00:58:51,371 --> 00:58:54,672
Just come and find me when
you're done. This list is craz.

979
00:59:31,041 --> 00:59:32,342
Hold that.

980
00:59:45,809 --> 00:59:47,411
I can't believe I fell for tha.

981
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,569
Great. Flat tire.

982
00:59:58,601 --> 01:00:01,201
[Spidey] Yo,
that's at least 15 feet deep.

983
01:00:01,268 --> 01:00:03,235
[Bo] Don't fall in.

984
01:00:03,301 --> 01:00:05,302
It's looking pretty gnarly!

985
01:00:11,868 --> 01:00:14,069
[Spidey] That's your jump,
Chrissy.

986
01:00:20,004 --> 01:00:21,536
[Jared] Let's go.

987
01:00:28,471 --> 01:00:30,103
I can't believe
you fell for that.

988
01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:33,071
- OK, really not the point.
- You gotta admit, it's funny.

989
01:00:33,138 --> 01:00:35,238
Mom, dad and grandpa are
going to think it's hilarious.

990
01:00:35,904 --> 01:00:38,239
There they are.

991
01:00:38,306 --> 01:00:42,371
- Do this and I'm a Dirt Devil?
- Absolutely. It's all you, br.

992
01:00:44,804 --> 01:00:46,973
[Johnny] Tell me he's not
gonna try that gap.

993
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:49,005
- I wish I could.
- Chris, wait!

994
01:00:49,072 --> 01:00:50,505
Decision time, C.

995
01:00:50,572 --> 01:00:52,639
Better hurry. Nephew
doesn't look too stoked.

996
01:00:52,705 --> 01:00:54,105
[Johnny] Chris, hold up!

997
01:01:11,674 --> 01:01:13,873
Oh! Oh!

998
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:17,074
- Chris!
- [laughs]

999
01:01:20,241 --> 01:01:22,507
- You all right?
- My arm! It kills.

1000
01:01:22,574 --> 01:01:25,475
- Stay still. Just stay still.
- That was awesome, dude.

1001
01:01:25,542 --> 01:01:27,676
Back off, all right?
I'm serious!

1002
01:01:27,743 --> 01:01:30,042
It's cool, OK?

1003
01:01:30,109 --> 01:01:31,877
- Does anything else hurt?
- No.

1004
01:01:31,942 --> 01:01:36,043
- I'm gonna get help, OK?
- OK. All right, go. Thanks.

1005
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:39,543
- You all right?
- How could you
let this happen, Johnny?

1006
01:01:39,609 --> 01:01:41,343
You were
keeping an eye on him.

1007
01:01:41,409 --> 01:01:45,409
I was. He's like some
12-year-old evil genius.

1008
01:01:45,476 --> 01:01:49,310
Johnny tried to stop Chris.
We just got there too late.

1009
01:01:49,377 --> 01:01:52,577
You gotta give him props for
that jump. It was pretty sweet.

1010
01:01:52,645 --> 01:01:55,012
I think we'll hold off on
the props for a little while.

1011
01:01:58,743 --> 01:02:01,844
We're lucky. It's a simple
fracture. Nothing serious.

1012
01:02:01,911 --> 01:02:05,212
I am so sorry
about all of this.

1013
01:02:05,277 --> 01:02:07,245
No, I'm sorry.
I should've kept an eye on him.

1014
01:02:07,312 --> 01:02:08,978
Sorry about your dinner...

1015
01:02:09,045 --> 01:02:14,179
No, Johnny, please. It's OK.
Chris told us everything.

1016
01:02:14,246 --> 01:02:16,613
- [Grandpa] Hey, Mel, Pete.
Help me clean up?
- Yeah.

1017
01:02:16,679 --> 01:02:18,513
- Can I help?
- Yeah. Come.

1018
01:02:34,781 --> 01:02:35,914
Does it hurt?

1019
01:02:37,382 --> 01:02:39,349
A... little.

1020
01:02:44,248 --> 01:02:46,380
That was a pretty
sweet jump, though.

1021
01:02:46,447 --> 01:02:49,449
- [car approaching]
- [indistinct radio chatter]

1022
01:02:51,817 --> 01:02:54,850
- This should be fun.
- Hey, relax.
This ain't about you.

1023
01:02:54,917 --> 01:02:56,417
Hey, Johnny T.

1024
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:02,049
[Oki] I've got bad news.

1025
01:03:02,116 --> 01:03:05,051
There was a break-in at
the store. It's been trashed.

1026
01:03:25,152 --> 01:03:26,851
Who would do
something like this?

1027
01:03:26,918 --> 01:03:30,252
I've got officers
canvassing the area.

1028
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:31,686
We'll do an investigation,

1029
01:03:31,752 --> 01:03:34,685
see if we can find fingerprints
on that window in back.

1030
01:03:34,752 --> 01:03:37,685
We've been here every day,
every night.

1031
01:03:37,752 --> 01:03:40,386
Whoever did this probably
knew you'd all be busy tonight.

1032
01:03:42,487 --> 01:03:44,221
- Jared.
- Jared.

1033
01:03:44,286 --> 01:03:47,953
We found him behind Dirt Devils
with a key to the store room.

1034
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:49,888
He was stashing this.

1035
01:03:57,420 --> 01:04:00,321
- [siren wails]
- Copy.

1036
01:04:00,388 --> 01:04:03,121
That's affirmative,
dispatch. Over.

1037
01:04:09,255 --> 01:04:11,190
There are three more bags
of stolen gear

1038
01:04:11,257 --> 01:04:12,556
where we found that one.

1039
01:04:12,623 --> 01:04:15,990
- Troy's on his way.
- Speak of the devil.

1040
01:04:21,056 --> 01:04:22,790
Oh, this is brutal.

1041
01:04:24,024 --> 01:04:26,190
It's not good for the opening.

1042
01:04:26,257 --> 01:04:27,924
[Oki] You know
anything about this?

1043
01:04:29,524 --> 01:04:31,092
Uh, no.

1044
01:04:32,656 --> 01:04:34,957
- Hey. Put in him the car.
- Come on.

1045
01:04:35,025 --> 01:04:37,492
- Sure we have to
call my parents?
- You're joking.

1046
01:04:37,558 --> 01:04:40,057
Troy. We're gonna need
access to your storeroom.

1047
01:04:40,125 --> 01:04:42,793
Oh, yeah. Absolutely.
You have my full cooperation.

1048
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:50,260
- Hey, John.
- Yeah, Troy.

1049
01:04:50,326 --> 01:04:52,692
I just want to apologize
for the other day.

1050
01:04:52,759 --> 01:04:56,692
- Ah...
- I have to admit
that I was nervous

1051
01:04:56,759 --> 01:05:00,825
about having the legend, the
great Johnny T., as competitio.

1052
01:05:00,893 --> 01:05:03,061
But, man,
this just makes me sick.

1053
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:07,359
And If there's, uh,
anything I can do to help...

1054
01:05:07,426 --> 01:05:10,361
You know, I don't think
there's much anyone can do.

1055
01:05:12,027 --> 01:05:15,027
Well, I better go and help out.

1056
01:05:15,094 --> 01:05:17,028
But hey, I heard about the jum.

1057
01:05:17,694 --> 01:05:21,196
Oh, you did? Cool.

1058
01:05:21,261 --> 01:05:23,095
It's impressive, man.

1059
01:05:23,161 --> 01:05:25,962
Why don't you come
by the store tomorrow?

1060
01:05:26,029 --> 01:05:27,929
I got a Dirt Devils helmet
in your size.

1061
01:05:27,996 --> 01:05:30,362
- Sweet.
- That's not going to happen.

1062
01:05:30,429 --> 01:05:31,930
What are you talking about?

1063
01:05:31,996 --> 01:05:33,496
You going to ride
for these guys

1064
01:05:33,562 --> 01:05:36,364
- after all that's happened?
- Johnny, please. Not now.

1065
01:05:36,431 --> 01:05:38,697
Hey, Troy.

1066
01:05:38,763 --> 01:05:42,330
- Time to go, brah.
- Oh, hey. My bad.

1067
01:05:42,397 --> 01:05:46,098
I guess when I see real talent,
I have to go after it.

1068
01:05:47,264 --> 01:05:50,464
But I hear ya.
Family first, right?

1069
01:05:53,098 --> 01:05:56,230
Come on, Val, we gotta get
you home. Chris, Johnny.

1070
01:05:56,297 --> 01:06:00,697
No. I'm not riding with him.

1071
01:06:00,763 --> 01:06:04,732
- He ruins everything for me!
- Christopher, please.

1072
01:06:05,766 --> 01:06:07,000
I hate this family.

1073
01:06:17,933 --> 01:06:21,299
Dad, listen, we'll all
sort this out tomorrow.

1074
01:06:21,366 --> 01:06:24,234
- Together, all right?
- Thanks, eh.

1075
01:06:30,234 --> 01:06:32,668
[Carla] I don't know
what I was thinking.

1076
01:06:33,801 --> 01:06:36,701
This place
might be paradise,

1077
01:06:36,768 --> 01:06:39,900
but it's still real life.

1078
01:06:39,967 --> 01:06:42,368
[Grandpa] A life
we can work on together.

1079
01:06:42,435 --> 01:06:45,103
All this can be fixed.

1080
01:06:46,735 --> 01:06:49,402
We'll ask the bank for an
extension on the loan...

1081
01:06:49,469 --> 01:06:51,870
It's not the shop, John.

1082
01:06:55,268 --> 01:06:57,370
I think I made a mistake.

1083
01:06:58,870 --> 01:07:01,504
Staying here,

1084
01:07:01,571 --> 01:07:04,804
thinking I could just
bring Chris with me

1085
01:07:04,871 --> 01:07:07,271
on my little
Hawaiian adventure.

1086
01:07:08,371 --> 01:07:11,405
And he's not luggage,
you know?

1087
01:07:11,471 --> 01:07:14,472
- He's a boy and...
- He just needs some time.

1088
01:07:14,538 --> 01:07:15,671
He'll come around.

1089
01:07:17,571 --> 01:07:20,205
I can't take that risk.

1090
01:07:24,572 --> 01:07:26,639
I just...

1091
01:07:30,806 --> 01:07:32,974
...can't marry you, John.

1092
01:07:34,306 --> 01:07:37,139
I'm taking Chris
back to Philly.

1093
01:07:37,206 --> 01:07:40,373
We'll sell the shop and, um,

1094
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:43,441
- of course
you'll get a share...
- Share?

1095
01:07:48,475 --> 01:07:53,306
I don't want a share,
I want you.

1096
01:07:53,373 --> 01:07:55,308
I want to be Chris's father.

1097
01:07:55,375 --> 01:07:58,042
I've barely been his mother.

1098
01:07:58,109 --> 01:08:00,942
I've been so wrapped up
in opening this business.

1099
01:08:04,375 --> 01:08:08,675
Hey, you're always saying

1100
01:08:08,741 --> 01:08:10,808
that things will work out,

1101
01:08:10,875 --> 01:08:13,343
let nature take its course.

1102
01:08:14,277 --> 01:08:16,744
But for the good of my son,

1103
01:08:17,944 --> 01:08:20,111
I can't wait that long.

1104
01:08:23,445 --> 01:08:25,044
I'm sorry.

1105
01:09:13,813 --> 01:09:16,147
Waves look
pretty tasty today.

1106
01:09:17,847 --> 01:09:21,448
Eh, don't feel like
getting in the water much, Pon.

1107
01:09:33,017 --> 01:09:34,683
[Johnny] It's funny.

1108
01:09:34,749 --> 01:09:38,549
I was getting used to the idea
of having a 12-year-old uncle.

1109
01:09:38,616 --> 01:09:42,750
Yeah, I can't imagine
them not being here,

1110
01:09:42,816 --> 01:09:44,417
Carla and Chris.

1111
01:09:45,683 --> 01:09:48,116
They've become
such a huge part of me.

1112
01:09:48,183 --> 01:09:50,284
You ever tell Chris that?

1113
01:09:51,852 --> 01:09:54,885
Hard to face that...

1114
01:09:54,950 --> 01:09:58,185
...whatever I say to Chris
is perhaps too late.

1115
01:09:58,252 --> 01:10:01,951
No! No, it's not.

1116
01:10:02,018 --> 01:10:05,352
We just need to figure out a wy
to make things pono again.

1117
01:10:09,752 --> 01:10:13,352
You and me, all right?
It's what we're great at.

1118
01:10:13,419 --> 01:10:15,252
It's right there
on my bedroom door.

1119
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:21,021
- [Grandpa laughs]
- What?

1120
01:10:22,453 --> 01:10:25,655
You're not a tadpole anymore,
eh, Pono?

1121
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:27,820
Not exactly.

1122
01:10:27,887 --> 01:10:30,755
I've been too busy
to even recognize that.

1123
01:10:32,486 --> 01:10:33,954
<i> Mahalo , Pono.</i>

1124
01:10:40,021 --> 01:10:41,989
You know what?

1125
01:10:42,054 --> 01:10:43,821
I know the one person
on the planet

1126
01:10:43,888 --> 01:10:45,588
that Chris might
actually listen to.

1127
01:10:46,955 --> 01:10:48,721
[knocking on door]

1128
01:10:48,789 --> 01:10:51,657
You, uh, go away, please.

1129
01:10:51,723 --> 01:10:54,623
- I'm sorry, I can't do that.
- Val!

1130
01:10:56,856 --> 01:11:01,056
- Val, what's up?
- I need to talk to you.

1131
01:11:01,822 --> 01:11:02,990
Why?

1132
01:11:03,057 --> 01:11:05,191
Somebody has to keep you
from becoming a Jared.

1133
01:11:05,257 --> 01:11:09,325
- Jared?
- Yeah.
It's Hawaiian for "loser."

1134
01:11:09,391 --> 01:11:13,258
Chris, Johnny Kapahala is,
like, the best big brother.

1135
01:11:13,324 --> 01:11:15,726
Or nephew or whatever
you could ever ask for.

1136
01:11:16,525 --> 01:11:17,725
And since he came here,

1137
01:11:17,792 --> 01:11:19,825
he's done nothing
but try to be your friend.

1138
01:11:19,892 --> 01:11:23,791
- You don't understand...
- He learned how to
dirt-board for you.

1139
01:11:23,857 --> 01:11:26,659
He made a fool of himself
for you. He skated the barge.

1140
01:11:26,726 --> 01:11:28,426
He tracked you down
when you ran away.

1141
01:11:28,493 --> 01:11:30,659
He stood up to Troy and Jared.

1142
01:11:30,726 --> 01:11:33,493
And yesterday, when the rest
of your so-called friends

1143
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:36,860
didn't even care whether or not
you jumped to your death,

1144
01:11:36,927 --> 01:11:41,494
- he tried to stop you.
- I didn't ask him
to do all that.

1145
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:45,694
- No. Mr. Kapahala did.
- What?

1146
01:11:45,761 --> 01:11:49,994
Johnny's grandpa, he asked his
17-year-old grandson to spend

1147
01:11:50,061 --> 01:11:51,862
his entire Hawaiian vacation

1148
01:11:51,928 --> 01:11:54,561
with his 12-year-old,
soon-to-be-stepson.

1149
01:11:54,628 --> 01:11:57,161
And Johnny did it.
I just don't get it.

1150
01:11:57,227 --> 01:12:00,861
You've got this whole family
of people who love you.

1151
01:12:00,928 --> 01:12:03,629
They want to be with you
and they want you to be happy.

1152
01:12:04,795 --> 01:12:06,896
Why would you
walk away from that?

1153
01:12:08,695 --> 01:12:09,763
[door slams]

1154
01:12:16,262 --> 01:12:20,362
- Do you see?
- Johnny and Chris talking?

1155
01:12:20,429 --> 01:12:24,397
- Should we be worried?
- Only if we hear police siren.

1156
01:12:25,897 --> 01:12:28,864
[Chris] This whole thing
is my fault.

1157
01:12:28,931 --> 01:12:31,731
If I would've listened to you
and not have gone for that jum,

1158
01:12:31,798 --> 01:12:34,565
Jared would have never
known about the party.

1159
01:12:35,132 --> 01:12:36,764
And...

1160
01:12:38,665 --> 01:12:42,132
...my mom would
be opening the shop today,

1161
01:12:42,197 --> 01:12:44,598
and she'd be marrying
your grandpa tonight.

1162
01:12:47,932 --> 01:12:51,166
Look, I... I really
want to fix this.

1163
01:12:52,333 --> 01:12:56,433
I just... don't know how.

1164
01:12:56,499 --> 01:13:00,100
- You really do?
- Yeah.

1165
01:13:00,167 --> 01:13:03,133
Then I guess it's a good thing
that your nephew's a genius.

1166
01:13:04,901 --> 01:13:07,268
[laughs] Come with me.

1167
01:13:09,801 --> 01:13:12,034
[Mel] Carla, what if you staye?

1168
01:13:12,101 --> 01:13:16,868
Just... postpone the wedding,
give the shop a chance. I...

1169
01:13:16,935 --> 01:13:21,435
- Give Dad some time with Chri.
- No, it's complicated.

1170
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:24,235
Well, of course it is.

1171
01:13:24,302 --> 01:13:27,169
I just...
I want you to know

1172
01:13:27,235 --> 01:13:30,536
we'll all be really sad
if you leave.

1173
01:13:30,602 --> 01:13:32,136
I mean, what's a
Hawaiian vacation

1174
01:13:32,203 --> 01:13:34,036
without some police
intervention

1175
01:13:34,102 --> 01:13:36,837
and a couple trips
to the emergency room?

1176
01:13:36,902 --> 01:13:38,969
[laughs] Hopefully,
we'll outgrow that.

1177
01:13:39,036 --> 01:13:41,503
- Exactly.
- Well, we got most

1178
01:13:41,570 --> 01:13:44,037
of the restaurant deposit back
for the reception.

1179
01:13:44,105 --> 01:13:46,338
We do, however,
have to eat there tonight

1180
01:13:46,405 --> 01:13:48,804
and order the entire
right side of the menu.

1181
01:13:48,870 --> 01:13:50,038
[phone rings]

1182
01:13:51,904 --> 01:13:55,804
Hello? Yeah. OK.

1183
01:13:55,871 --> 01:13:57,239
All right.

1184
01:13:58,637 --> 01:13:59,770
That was Johnny.

1185
01:13:59,838 --> 01:14:02,170
- What's up?
- He's at the store with Chris.

1186
01:14:02,237 --> 01:14:03,740
Well, is Chris OK?

1187
01:14:09,106 --> 01:14:11,972
Chris? Open up.
It's locked.

1188
01:14:12,039 --> 01:14:13,306
Pono!

1189
01:14:16,839 --> 01:14:19,306
[Grandpa chuckles]

1190
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:23,141
[Mel] This is incredible! Oh!

1191
01:14:23,208 --> 01:14:25,841
- [Grandpa] Unreal, eh?
- Look at that.

1192
01:14:25,908 --> 01:14:27,775
- [gasps]
- [laughs]

1193
01:14:30,708 --> 01:14:35,508
- Surprise!
- Chris! Did you do this?

1194
01:14:35,574 --> 01:14:38,107
Yep. Me and my friends.

1195
01:14:38,174 --> 01:14:40,174
- Oh, my...
- [Johnny] We debated.

1196
01:14:40,241 --> 01:14:43,842
Fix up the shop or do something
dangerous and/or illegal.

1197
01:14:43,910 --> 01:14:46,042
- We settled on this.
- Good choice.

1198
01:14:46,109 --> 01:14:49,075
- You no need do that, Pono.
- Yes. Yes, we did.

1199
01:14:49,142 --> 01:14:50,442
Yeah.

1200
01:14:50,509 --> 01:14:52,676
- Hey, uh, you know Val, right?
- Mom.

1201
01:14:52,743 --> 01:14:55,575
- Hey, Val.
- She's really bossy.

1202
01:14:55,642 --> 01:14:57,944
I am. But in a good way.

1203
01:14:58,009 --> 01:15:01,210
Mom, I don't want to move...

1204
01:15:02,276 --> 01:15:04,277
...yet.

1205
01:15:04,343 --> 01:15:06,509
You know, I think
I could like it here.

1206
01:15:06,576 --> 01:15:10,311
- Really?
- Yeah.

1207
01:15:10,378 --> 01:15:13,911
Oh, sweetheart.
I love you.

1208
01:15:31,445 --> 01:15:34,812
- What do you think about thes?
- [girl] I like that one.

1209
01:15:34,879 --> 01:15:37,812
- I want you to see this.
- [girl] Oh, cool.

1210
01:15:37,879 --> 01:15:39,445
- Hey.
- Hey.

1211
01:15:39,512 --> 01:15:42,112
OK, put it there.

1212
01:15:42,179 --> 01:15:44,579
No, no, no, don't do that.

1213
01:15:44,646 --> 01:15:48,580
How 'bout over here?
Around this corner.

1214
01:15:48,646 --> 01:15:51,314
Hang on, I think there's...
over here. It's perfect.

1215
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:54,214
Can you just put it here? Grea.

1216
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:57,014
Let me think...

1217
01:15:57,081 --> 01:15:59,882
Sam! Sam!

1218
01:16:01,815 --> 01:16:04,650
- She's just like my mom.
- [Val] Sam!

1219
01:16:08,449 --> 01:16:11,450
- What, bro? She scares me.
- Listen, listen, listen.

1220
01:16:11,517 --> 01:16:13,650
- Hey! Look...
- When my buyer backed out,

1221
01:16:13,717 --> 01:16:15,549
you said you'd step in.

1222
01:16:15,616 --> 01:16:17,083
You come all this way
to tell me...

1223
01:16:17,150 --> 01:16:18,750
What's going on?

1224
01:16:18,816 --> 01:16:20,350
- My life is riding
on this deal.
- Gee.

1225
01:16:20,415 --> 01:16:22,484
It was great not
doing business with you.

1226
01:16:22,549 --> 01:16:24,917
- Look. Listen, all right, man.
- Uh-oh.

1227
01:16:24,984 --> 01:16:27,217
[Troy] Can't do this.
We had a verbal contract.

1228
01:16:27,284 --> 01:16:29,984
[Mr. Clark] Negotiating.
Our negotiations broke down.

1229
01:16:30,051 --> 01:16:33,750
- [Troy] No, they didn't, man.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1230
01:16:33,817 --> 01:16:37,084
- What's up?
- Troy here was hoping
I'd buy his shop

1231
01:16:37,151 --> 01:16:39,819
as a site for my
new condo development.

1232
01:16:39,884 --> 01:16:42,151
- Condos?
- It appears as if your mentor

1233
01:16:42,218 --> 01:16:45,052
- is moving to California.
- [Chris] Wait.

1234
01:16:45,119 --> 01:16:46,485
What about the Dirt Devils?

1235
01:16:46,552 --> 01:16:49,486
Troy, you said that
I could be on your crew.

1236
01:16:49,553 --> 01:16:52,520
- This isn't about you, C.
- No, actually, it is.

1237
01:16:52,587 --> 01:16:56,087
It's about all these kids,
including my daughter.

1238
01:16:56,154 --> 01:16:59,986
Wait, she's... No.
I had no idea.

1239
01:17:00,053 --> 01:17:02,985
Oh, you're surprised?
Now you know how we feel.

1240
01:17:03,053 --> 01:17:06,821
Val, all right, this is
business. You don't understand.

1241
01:17:06,887 --> 01:17:10,853
I do understand. I understand
you don't even care about us.

1242
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:13,087
You were gonna move
and leave us in the dust.

1243
01:17:13,154 --> 01:17:15,087
So I told my dad
that we don't need

1244
01:17:15,154 --> 01:17:18,089
any more condos on the island.
We don't need Troy's shop.

1245
01:17:18,155 --> 01:17:20,022
There's a new
board store in town.

1246
01:17:20,088 --> 01:17:22,989
One that cares about the sport,
not just the money.

1247
01:17:23,056 --> 01:17:26,490
[laughs] Oh, this is... This is
really funny. Man, this is goo.

1248
01:17:26,556 --> 01:17:28,289
I mean, you've got,
like, what?

1249
01:17:28,356 --> 01:17:30,556
You've got five
mountain boards over there?

1250
01:17:30,621 --> 01:17:33,556
No real rider is
gonna give you a second look.

1251
01:17:33,623 --> 01:17:36,656
- Johnny T!
- Hey, Akoni! How is it?

1252
01:17:36,722 --> 01:17:39,389
- Where you want these?
- That's Akoni Kama! Akoni!

1253
01:17:39,456 --> 01:17:41,656
How you guys doing?
Hey, man. Check it out.

1254
01:17:41,723 --> 01:17:44,156
- Akoni Kama!
- This is so cool.

1255
01:17:44,223 --> 01:17:45,824
You do what you
have to, Johnny T.

1256
01:17:45,891 --> 01:17:48,257
You have your little
moment in the sun.

1257
01:17:48,324 --> 01:17:50,258
Once Akoni Kama
goes back to the Mainland

1258
01:17:50,324 --> 01:17:51,892
and his signed boards
are gone,

1259
01:17:51,958 --> 01:17:54,391
those kids are going
to be back riding for me,

1260
01:17:54,458 --> 01:17:58,459
'cause I'm the real deal.
I'm going to crush you, old ma.

1261
01:17:58,525 --> 01:18:02,526
I'm gonna make sure that
you lose your whole place
and everything in it.

1262
01:18:08,392 --> 01:18:12,226
- It's never gonna stop, is it?
- Doesn't seem like it, Pono.

1263
01:18:12,293 --> 01:18:13,960
Hey, Troy.

1264
01:18:14,026 --> 01:18:16,192
I thought you were the
godfather of dirt-boarding.

1265
01:18:19,127 --> 01:18:23,026
I just realized
I've never seen you ride.

1266
01:18:23,093 --> 01:18:26,360
Uh, you got a point,
surfer boy?

1267
01:18:26,428 --> 01:18:29,561
It's sort of a tradition
in our family.

1268
01:18:29,628 --> 01:18:32,527
We settle things with
our skills, not our mouths.

1269
01:18:34,794 --> 01:18:38,328
- What did you have in mind?
- [Grandpa] Mountain-board rac.

1270
01:18:38,396 --> 01:18:41,295
You win, we take the
four-wheel boards out,

1271
01:18:41,361 --> 01:18:43,295
drop 'em here
at your doorstep.

1272
01:18:43,361 --> 01:18:45,228
You get all the
dirt gear you want.

1273
01:18:45,295 --> 01:18:48,230
I win, both stores
sell what they want.

1274
01:18:48,295 --> 01:18:50,228
These guys get a choice.

1275
01:18:50,295 --> 01:18:54,062
[laughs] You can't be serious.

1276
01:18:54,128 --> 01:18:56,696
- Dad, are you sure about this?
- Yeah. I'm sure.

1277
01:18:56,763 --> 01:19:00,530
- I got faith in my grandson.
- Well, that's fine with me.

1278
01:19:00,597 --> 01:19:01,963
You bring it.

1279
01:19:04,496 --> 01:19:07,463
And what do you know.
I've got just the spot

1280
01:19:07,530 --> 01:19:10,432
to hold this
little race, don't we?

1281
01:19:10,498 --> 01:19:14,299
You remember how I told you
my dad likes to own things?

1282
01:19:20,598 --> 01:19:22,333
Yeah! All right!

1283
01:19:27,799 --> 01:19:31,565
- Daddy, this is fantastic!
- Well, it was John's idea,
actually.

1284
01:19:31,633 --> 01:19:34,066
He wanted someplace safe
for kids to dirt-board.

1285
01:19:34,133 --> 01:19:35,467
I made contacts,

1286
01:19:35,534 --> 01:19:38,232
but his vision got the bank
to fund the development.

1287
01:19:38,299 --> 01:19:39,799
I thought I was
your partner.

1288
01:19:39,866 --> 01:19:42,299
- Ah, it was a secret.
- He did this for you.

1289
01:19:42,366 --> 01:19:44,200
You're one lucky young man.

1290
01:19:44,267 --> 01:19:47,368
When Johnny was little, he had
the whole ocean to do his thin.

1291
01:19:47,435 --> 01:19:50,133
I thought you needed a place
to do what you love.

1292
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:53,034
- Here's where you say,
"Thank you."
- Oh, got it. Thanks.

1293
01:19:53,101 --> 01:19:54,935
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1294
01:19:55,002 --> 01:19:57,901
- You really are
a great dad, Dad.
- Thanks.

1295
01:19:57,968 --> 01:20:00,136
Come on!
Let's scope out the track.

1296
01:20:02,002 --> 01:20:03,468
Race you!

1297
01:20:04,435 --> 01:20:06,535
Whoo!

1298
01:20:08,468 --> 01:20:10,936
It's another mountain,
eh, Pono?

1299
01:20:13,236 --> 01:20:15,671
How do we keep on
getting ourselves into this?

1300
01:20:15,736 --> 01:20:19,602
The Kapahala way,
that's what. [laughs]

1301
01:20:19,669 --> 01:20:23,569
- You're not nervous, are you?
- No. Why would I be nervous?

1302
01:20:25,003 --> 01:20:26,737
No pressure at all,
right?

1303
01:20:28,804 --> 01:20:30,771
Remember when you was a kid,

1304
01:20:30,838 --> 01:20:33,737
you asked me who the
best surfer in the world was?

1305
01:20:35,304 --> 01:20:37,905
And you told me the one
who's having the most fun.

1306
01:20:37,971 --> 01:20:39,772
That's the one!

1307
01:20:42,705 --> 01:20:44,538
<i> Mahalo , Grandp.</i>

1308
01:20:53,606 --> 01:20:57,241
- [Sam] Yo, J, you ready?
- You know it.

1309
01:20:59,873 --> 01:21:01,973
Hey, bro, listen.
Stay frosty, all right, man?

1310
01:21:02,039 --> 01:21:03,439
Stay frosty.
You got this.

1311
01:21:03,507 --> 01:21:06,507
- It's dirt-boarding.
- Oh, yeah.

1312
01:21:06,574 --> 01:21:10,008
[laughs] I'm just playing, man.
Hey, stay dusty, man.

1313
01:21:10,074 --> 01:21:12,241
- Stay dusty, all right.
Troy who?
- [laughs]

1314
01:21:12,307 --> 01:21:15,542
Hey, OK, guys. OK. I, uh,
scoped out the whole course.

1315
01:21:15,609 --> 01:21:17,708
Remember up at the top
there's a wall ride.

1316
01:21:17,775 --> 01:21:20,042
Uh, the tree barrel
and the right hand berm.

1317
01:21:20,109 --> 01:21:21,975
- Right.
- When you come out of that,

1318
01:21:22,042 --> 01:21:24,343
keep your speed 'cause
of the crazy water feature.

1319
01:21:24,409 --> 01:21:26,743
- Then...
- Scrub speed for rollers...

1320
01:21:26,808 --> 01:21:29,141
And then you hit the
three big tabletops jumps.

1321
01:21:29,209 --> 01:21:31,709
- Right.
- All right. Cool.

1322
01:21:31,776 --> 01:21:35,777
Oh, and, uh, Johnny?
Be careful.

1323
01:21:38,076 --> 01:21:40,709
Hey. Thanks, man.

1324
01:21:40,776 --> 01:21:43,243
Listen, you're the one
that should be racing Troy.

1325
01:21:43,310 --> 01:21:44,343
You're better than me.

1326
01:21:44,410 --> 01:21:47,078
Dude, it's just a snowboard...

1327
01:21:48,343 --> 01:21:50,011
...on wheels.

1328
01:21:51,377 --> 01:21:53,477
All right. Good luck.

1329
01:21:55,146 --> 01:21:58,212
Hey, since it's a race, I don't
have to know how to stop anywa.

1330
01:21:58,279 --> 01:22:00,411
- [laughing]
- Hey, where you going?

1331
01:22:00,478 --> 01:22:03,544
I'm gonna make sure that the
ambulance has the motor runnin.

1332
01:22:03,611 --> 01:22:06,612
Yeah. Thanks, but you think
you could drop the gate for me?

1333
01:22:06,678 --> 01:22:09,145
Yeah, come on.
Of course.

1334
01:22:09,213 --> 01:22:11,679
Oh, you're in
way over your head.

1335
01:22:14,813 --> 01:22:16,112
Maybe.

1336
01:22:17,445 --> 01:22:20,613
But, hey, at least
I know how to swim.

1337
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:25,813
[laughs]

1338
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:29,246
All right, check it out.
Here are the rules.

1339
01:22:29,313 --> 01:22:32,447
Get to the finish, three jumps,
three tricks to win. All right?

1340
01:22:32,514 --> 01:22:36,248
Now the winner has to nail
three tricks before the finish.

1341
01:22:36,315 --> 01:22:38,882
Cool? All right.

1342
01:22:49,981 --> 01:22:51,382
[Sam] Riders ready...

1343
01:22:55,415 --> 01:22:56,717
...set...

1344
01:25:27,530 --> 01:25:29,129
[cheering]

1345
01:25:42,731 --> 01:25:46,197
- [cheering]
- [laughing]

1346
01:25:49,330 --> 01:25:50,498
Man!

1347
01:26:11,566 --> 01:26:14,033
[cheering]

1348
01:26:20,101 --> 01:26:22,201
[cheering]

1349
01:26:34,801 --> 01:26:36,535
Come on, J!

1350
01:26:40,102 --> 01:26:42,469
Come on! Come on, Johnny!

1351
01:26:50,468 --> 01:26:53,736
[grunts, groaning]

1352
01:27:09,137 --> 01:27:12,104
[cheering]

1353
01:27:12,170 --> 01:27:15,237
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

1354
01:27:24,373 --> 01:27:26,072
[gasping]

1355
01:27:31,271 --> 01:27:33,206
- Johnny!
- Pono!

1356
01:27:38,106 --> 01:27:40,507
You all right, Pono?
Say something.

1357
01:27:42,406 --> 01:27:46,274
- That was sweet.
- [laughs]

1358
01:27:46,341 --> 01:27:49,874
- [grunting]
- Nice.

1359
01:27:49,941 --> 01:27:52,474
The Kapahala way.

1360
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:54,607
- [laughter]
- Whoo!

1361
01:27:54,674 --> 01:27:57,975
- Yeah!
- [cheering]

1362
01:27:58,042 --> 01:28:00,008
Congratulations!

1363
01:28:01,941 --> 01:28:04,475
- That was nice.
- Man!

1364
01:28:04,542 --> 01:28:08,642
- [Chris] Sweet, man.
- [Carla] That was so great.
My gosh!

1365
01:28:15,176 --> 01:28:19,776
- You know, this isn't over.
- [Oki] Yes, it is.

1366
01:28:19,843 --> 01:28:22,144
Shouldn't you be watching
Jared or something?

1367
01:28:22,210 --> 01:28:23,976
I can see Jared.
He's right there.

1368
01:28:24,044 --> 01:28:26,943
See, Jared's been released
to the custody of his parents.

1369
01:28:27,009 --> 01:28:29,776
- It's you we wanna talk to.
- You got nothing on me.

1370
01:28:29,843 --> 01:28:33,111
The night of the break-in,
you heard about Chris's jump.

1371
01:28:33,178 --> 01:28:35,744
The only way you could've
is if you talked to Jared.

1372
01:28:35,811 --> 01:28:37,545
He gave us
a full confession.

1373
01:28:37,611 --> 01:28:39,911
Told us all about your
little powwow that night.

1374
01:28:39,978 --> 01:28:42,344
So I figure,
aiding and abetting,

1375
01:28:42,411 --> 01:28:44,811
coercion of juvenile
to commit a felony.

1376
01:28:44,878 --> 01:28:47,945
- Hey, Oki...
- Don't talk, Troy.

1377
01:28:48,012 --> 01:28:49,612
Your attorney probably
wouldn't like it.

1378
01:28:50,812 --> 01:28:52,312
[Rooster] Hey, Chris.

1379
01:28:54,047 --> 01:28:56,281
- Hey.
- Hey.

1380
01:28:56,347 --> 01:29:00,112
- Cool park.
- Yeah. Good race.

1381
01:29:00,179 --> 01:29:03,880
- Thanks, man.
- So, you wanna try it out?

1382
01:29:03,947 --> 01:29:07,248
- Sure. Yeah.
- Let's go.

1383
01:29:07,313 --> 01:29:08,614
I just want to go home,

1384
01:29:08,681 --> 01:29:10,248
put my feet up and look out
at the ocean for a while.

1385
01:29:10,313 --> 01:29:11,847
Oh, I'm right behind you.

1386
01:29:13,347 --> 01:29:16,747
Well, we might have to put the
hammock time on a little hold.

1387
01:29:16,815 --> 01:29:19,682
- Oh, now what?
- You know, I was just thinkin.

1388
01:29:19,749 --> 01:29:23,949
It would be such a shame
to let that beautiful dress
to go to waste.

1389
01:29:25,216 --> 01:29:27,682
Ta-da!

1390
01:29:27,749 --> 01:29:30,916
[Mel] Oh! Oh, my gosh!

1391
01:29:30,982 --> 01:29:33,682
- [Grandpa] Close one, eh?
- Congratulations, Dad.

1392
01:29:33,749 --> 01:29:37,882
- I'm really happy for you.
- Thanks.

1393
01:29:37,949 --> 01:29:40,984
[man] I now pronounce you
man and wife.

1394
01:29:41,049 --> 01:29:44,284
John Kapahala,
you may kiss your bride.

1395
01:29:44,351 --> 01:29:46,917
[speaks Hawaiian]

1396
01:29:46,984 --> 01:29:50,485
- [Hawaiian music plays]
- [applause]

1397
01:30:37,155 --> 01:30:40,121
- [Grandpa] Whee!
- Yeah.

1398
01:30:40,187 --> 01:30:42,955
So, you ready
to give that a try soon?

1399
01:30:43,022 --> 01:30:46,422
Whatever, whatever.
Surfing's no big deal.

1400
01:30:46,490 --> 01:30:49,223
No big deal? Did he
just say no big deal?

1401
01:30:49,289 --> 01:30:51,556
- I think he did.
- No!

1402
01:30:51,623 --> 01:30:53,956
- Whee!
- [Chris laughs]

1403
01:30:54,022 --> 01:30:58,024
- Here it comes! Here it comes!
- Whoo!

1404
01:31:01,524 --> 01:31:03,089
You guys
were gonna throw me in.

1405
01:31:03,156 --> 01:31:04,790
Yeah, and
you were scared.

1406
01:31:04,857 --> 01:31:06,656
Ooh, yeah.
Scared. For sure.

1407
01:31:06,723 --> 01:31:09,524
No, no, no. I saw your eyes.
I saw fear in your eyes...
