00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,115
Hi, Jason.

187
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:53,700
You going on a trip?
Yes, we are.

188
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,784
Give us a hug.

189
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,245
Jason! Son!

190
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,789
Give us a hug.
Make it official.

191
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,502
How’s your mom?
Great.

192
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:05,795
That’s too bad.

193
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,297
Hi.
Hi.

194
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:14,429
You must buy.

195
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,558
Bro, I’m just browsing.

196
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,560
Break seal,
you pay.

197
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,454
What are you reading?

198
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:41,915
 Bikini.

199
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,209
Ah, yes.
Spike Lee.

200
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:45,877
What a character.

201
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,384
What’s the name of
that magazine again?

202
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:55,553
Oh.

203
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,190
Anything else?

204
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,567
Hmm? No.

205
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:14,489
Do you mind
standing over there?

206
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:25,667
Yes?

207
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,627
Your hair.

208
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,505
I know. It’s red,
and I have really fair skin.

209
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:31,840
Look, I was up all night,

210
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,008
so could you not pick up
on me right now?

211
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,970
No, no, I’m not trying
to pick up on you. I’m just--

212
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,347
I’m just intrigued.

213
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,934
You’re not from L.A.,
are you?

214
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,479
Well, that’s
a very long story.

215
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:50,525
I don’t think I can
disclose that kind of
information quite yet.

216
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,360
Thank you.

217
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,406
Uh, hot dogs.

218
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,785
Can I buy you
a hot dog?

219
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,079
You’re intrigued, huh?

220
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,498
Yes.

221
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,208
Yeah, well, when
he does his laundry,

222
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,751
he’ll be looking
for that sock.

223
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,631
So tell me
about this new guy.

224
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,428
Um, his name is Chad.

225
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,138
I met him at
a magazine stand.

226
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,432
End of story.

227
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,851
Chad? That’s his name?

228
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,227
Yeah.

229
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,313
[sighs]

230
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,981
Honey, Chads
are the worst.

231
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:32,650
Okay. Here we go.

232
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:36,446
No, no. I’m just saying
that Chads are bad news.

233
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:39,240
I believe in
the exceptions of this world
and all that bullshit,

234
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,744
but I’ve been dumped
and dogged by too many Chads
to not say anything.

235
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:45,330
Let’s get cocktails.

236
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,207
Good. Let’s go.

237
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:53,338
I don’t get it. Okay, what?
You do what?  You do what?

238
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:57,675
[sighs]
You wrap your fingers
around the base of the sac,

239
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,345
and you lick all around.
You know what you get.

240
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,847
[laughs]
[laughs]

241
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,933
Whatever!
It gets them off,

242
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:07,894
and that’s all
you need to know.

243
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,562
Next.
Jenn, seriously.

244
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,148
You mean to say that
in 22 years of innocence,

245
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,441
you haven’t
learned this?

246
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,276
This is the basics!

247
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,861
Okay, wait.

248
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,446
Do you do this

249
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:22,367
while or before
you’re sucking on him?

250
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:25,036
Oh, good. Now, there’s
an intelligent question.

251
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,204
Now we can get somewhere.

252
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:30,249
Okay. And the answer
to that is...anyone?

253
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,793
Anyone?
I don’t know.

254
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:32,961
April?

255
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,837
I’ll say either
for 200, Pat.

256
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,006
Beautiful.

257
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,592
If you’ve already
started sucking him off,

258
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,804
and you want to go back
and do the sac thing,

259
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,931
you never break
the rhythm.

260
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,558
You always transition
your hand

261
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,811
into stroking
your partner

262
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:52,563
before you head
for his balls.

263
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,399
And also, Suzanne.
What?

264
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,484
Don’t be afraid
to experiment.

265
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,403
Like what?
Like using the teeth.

266
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,071
People think
teeth are bad.

267
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,364
That’s not
necessarily so.

268
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:02,782
Teeth are your friends.

269
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,492
Teeth are danger,

270
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,952
which
equals excitement.

271
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,662
It’s nothing like it.

272
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:08,871
Let me see your teeth.

273
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:15,253
See, that’s a mouthful
of potential right there.

274
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,504
Just try it.

275
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,464
They get this glazed
look in their eyes.

276
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,550
It drives them crazy.

277
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,260
And then they say to you,
they say,

278
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:26,973
"April. God, where’d you
learn how to do this, baby?"

279
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,517
And you say,
"Jenn taught me."

280
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,810
[gargles]

281
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,854
[Suzanne]
You’re vile.

282
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,689
Eww, Jenn.

283
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,816
[Bartender]
Ladies and gentlemen,

284
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,901
I have an announcement
to make.

285
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:42,613
[all]
Last call for alcohol!

286
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:45,533
Earl, what are you
doing later tonight?

287
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,201
[Earl]
Hey, baby.

288
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,753
[telephone rings]

289
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,258
[ring]

290
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,471
Hello?

291
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,264
 Hi.

292
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:11,184
Who is this?
 Chad, from the magazine stand.

293
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:14,145
 Who is this?
 Who do you think it is?

294
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:16,022
 So how you doing?

295
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,398
Fine. How are you?

296
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,150
 Good, good.
 And you?

297
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,069
I just told you
I was fine.

298
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:22,570
 I know. I realized that,

299
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,530
 and I was hoping maybe
 you wouldn’t notice, so--

300
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,907
 Claire, hey, guess what.

301
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:27,241
 I just finished
 my first sculpture.

302
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,868
You sculpt?

303
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,411
 Nope. I’ve only done
 one sculpture.

304
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,288
Oh.

305
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,790
 So I’m talking you out.

306
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,500
Really? Where?

307
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,336
 Well, I’ll pick you up
 and we’ll just...go.

308
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:40,088
Whatever.

309
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:41,881
 Okay, so I’ll see you
 tomorrow night.

310
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,176
Okay. Um, do you wanna
know where I live?

311
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:50,014
This right here is
the labia majora.

312
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:53,768
This is the labia
minora on the inside.

313
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:56,270
 This is
 the access canal.

I don’t know.

What, Neal?

339
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:28,089
Will I see you tonight?

340
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:30,132
I’m really tired.
I didn’t get enough sleep.

[car door closes]

346
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,328
I’m obviously picking her
up from some one-night stand.

00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,248
I’m supposed to act
like nothing unusual
is going on?

348
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,792
Like I’m picking her up
from work or something?

349
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,460
This is wrong, Claire.

350
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,254
I’m dating a hooker.

351
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,422
She’s
an honorary hooker.

352
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,674
April is evil.

353

She’s not evil.
She’s-- She’s confused.

stability in her life.

356
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,683
I’m gonna tell you this once
and forever hold my peace.

357
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,435

That’s not true.

It is true,
but...I love her.

361
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,194
Because you can’t have her.

362
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,904
That’s not entirely true.

363
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:36,157
Okay, then why are
you in love with her?

364
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,743
Because I’m in love
with her.

365
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:42,747
She’s wild. She’s...
I love her voice.

366
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,540
 I love her-- her eyes.

367
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,126
She’s...intellectually
stimulating.

368
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,586
What?

369
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:51,839
I’m just making sure
you’re listening.

370
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,342
I’m listening.

371
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:58,721
Why can’t someone
say those things about me?

372
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:02,850
I-- I would say those
things about you.

373
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,769
You don’t count.

374
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:12,109
Do you know one time
I got crabs from
thrift-shop clothing?

375
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,236
Are you sure
it was a thrift shop?

376
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,447
Yes!

377
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:17,698
[clears throat]

378
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:20,034
Hey, have you talked
to Neal at all?

379
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:21,827
I told him you’re evil.

380
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,829
What?
[laughs]

381
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,540
Claire,
that’s really good.

382
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,211
I-- I keep my distance,
yes, but I’m not evil.

383
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:31,212
What did you say?

384
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:33,005
You’re breaking
his heart, April.

385
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,508
No, he’s breaking
his own heart.

386
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:38,761
He has to realize
I’m not always gonna
be there for him.

387
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:41,055
Yeah, but when
you need him,
he’s there.

388
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:43,140
What a second.
Whose side are you on this?

389
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,810
I just like having fun.
Is that such a crime?

390
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,186
I don’t know what’s
wrong with people.

391
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,105
I gotta be
completely honest
with you.

392
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:50,981
I’m completely
attracted to you.

393
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,525
No holds barred--

394
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,610
Humor me. Tell me
what you think.

395
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,946
Just be
completely honest,
be completely candid.

396
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,114
Tell me what you
think about me?

397
00:19:58,114 --> 00:19:59,907
Honestly?
Yeah.

398
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,201
I think you’re
disgusting.

399
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,954
What do you think
of this dress?

400
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:06,914
Um, no.

401
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,707
I think you should
show your body off
a little more.

402
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,377
Like one of these
would be nice
on you, Claire.

403
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,170
You’d see my crotch.

404
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,213
You wear underwear.

405
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,589
I plan to.

406
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,925
Are you gonna buy those?

407
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,638
No.

408
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:28,102
I’m that close to
bursting out in tears.

409
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:34,650
So do you think
this guy’s really worth
buying a new dress?

410
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,235
I don’t know.
I’ll find out.

411
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,945
Okay, so are we
gonna leave,

412
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,030
or are we gonna move in,
or what’s going on?

413
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,116
Are you on
amphetamines?

414
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:43,868
’Cause you’re really
annoying, Jason,

415
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:46,537
in that special
buzzy way, you know?

416
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:48,622
That’s completely original.

417
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:52,126
Great.
[laughs]

418
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:54,920
So where is he
gonna take you?
Do you know?

419
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,339
I’ll find out tonight.

420
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,217
I hope it’s
someplace nice.

421
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,927
[sighs]

422
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,144
Is this where you
take all the girls?

423
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:11,854
No, you’re the first.

424
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:14,398
My clothes weren’t dry,
and I didn’t want to be late.

425
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:17,693
Well, as long
as I’m your first.

426
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,695
Yes, the first and only.

427
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,408
So where to now,
the supermarket?

428
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:27,828
Ha ha! I like that,
but, uh, no.

429
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,414
The restaurant will do.

430
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,472
Hi.
Hi.

431
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,682
Hi.

432
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,476
You’re not offended,
are you?

433
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,811
I haven’t had time
to think about it.

434
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,773
I like you, Claire.

435
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,316
Claire, I like you.

436
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:13,123
Look, all I’m saying
is you shouldn’t be
working for me, Jenny.

437
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,793
You’re too fucking smart.

438
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,461
God, I don’t know what
I’d do without you.

439
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,421
You saved my life.

440
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,589
You know, I was
thinking last night.

441
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,424
You wanna know
what I thought?

442
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,842
Yes, Ravi.

443
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,971
That you are
a hell of a lot more
talented than I am.

444
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:29,348
I mean, I should know.
It’s fucking me,
isn’t it?

445
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,475
Wow.

446
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,143
 Hola.

447
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,562
Oma?

448
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:37,690
You know, I’ve been
watching you all night.

449
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,651
Really?
How’s that feel?

450
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:43,112
Uh, pardon me.
Is this guy bothering
you at all?

451
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:45,364
Who the fuck are you?

452
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,615
Who the--

453
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,659
I’m your worst fucking
nightmare, dick breath.

454
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,369
Why don’t you
go back to your fucking
drink over there?

455
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,954
She’s my fucking
girlfriend, all right?

456
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:53,539
Since you put it
that way.
Uhh!

457
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,624
Oh, come on.
Peace, guys.

458
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:58,836
Hey, fuck you, lumberjack!

459
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,514
You know, I’m not--
I’m not offended.

460
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,683
How you--
What?

461
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:14,059
How you kissed me.

462
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,561
I thought about it,
and I’m not offended.

463
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,646
Oh. Oh, good.

464
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:20,024
I mean, it’s not like
you shoved your tongue
down my throat.

465
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:21,692
Yeah. Yeah, right. I mean,
sexual tension, you know?

466
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:23,277
You gotta deal with it.

467
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:25,487
You get rid of it or it grows
into this thing, you know?

468
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,573
I know. Maybe that’s
why I never date.

469
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:30,326
I get paranoid
and uncomfortable,

470
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:32,077
and it’s like you
barely know the person

471
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,662
you’re sitting
right across from,
and you’re like--

472
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,664
Can I smell your hair?

473
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:36,790
Yeah.

474
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:48,427
[laughs]
[laughs]

475
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,179
I want your hair
to cover me

476
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:51,555
with maps of new places.

477
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,140
So that everywhere I go

478
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,892
will be as beautiful
as your hair.

479
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:58,228
Richard Brautigan.

480
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,606
Oh, shit! You know him?

481
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:02,733
Yeah, very well.

482
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:05,319
What is that one poem?
That one-- I love this poem.

483
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:09,114
Um, it’s never having
had it so gently--

484
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,033
I’ve never had it done
so gently before.

485
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:13,869
Yeah, right, right.

486
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,163
The sweet juices
of your mouth

487
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,749
are liked castles
baked in honey.

488
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:21,627
I’ve never had it done
so gently before.

489
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:24,630
You put a circle of
castles around my penis,

490
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,465
and you swill them--

491
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:30,177
Like sunlight
on the wings of birds.

492
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:36,141
Wow.

493
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,143
What a coincidence.

494
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,436
Are you a Sagittarius?

495
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,355
No.

496
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:43,899
Me, neither.

497
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,573
You want to come in
for a minute?

498
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:54,076
I can’t. I want to,
but I can’t.

499
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:55,869
I gotta be in Nevada
at 6 a.m. tomorrow--

500
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:58,163
Or today, actually.

501
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,416
Are you doing
some gambling?

502
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,292
[laughs]
[laughs]

503
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,628
No, actually. I’m doing
a K-Mart commercial.

504
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:07,131
You do K-Mart commercials?
This is my first one.

505
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:10,801
Well, okay. I guess
this is good-bye, then.

506
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:12,386
Hey, I’ll call you
the day after tomorrow--

507
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:14,930
Or I guess tomorrow--

508
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,140
I’ll call you
when I get back.

509
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,891
Friday.

510
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:18,892
Jesus,
you are brilliant.

511
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:21,270
I could have just
said Friday.

512
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,522
Okay.

513
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,648
Good-bye, Chad.

514
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:57,055
[groans]

515
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:17,910
Hi. Thank you so much,
Suzanne, for getting me.

516
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,454
Oh, my God!
What happened to your forehead?

517
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:21,830
[coughs]
What?

518
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,082
You have, like, a--

519
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,083
Look!

520
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:31,173
Oh, man.

521
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:34,551
I guess the bedpost
must have hit it.

522
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:38,222
It’s really that obvious?

523
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:40,682
No.

524
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,267
No, no, no. No.

525
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:47,064
Oh, man.

526
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:51,360
It wasn’t
that hard, Claire.

527
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,070
I shouldn’t
have a bruise.

528
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,197
I’ve never had this happen
before in my life.

529
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:56,824
Maybe you bruise easily.

530
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,450
Are you taking
enough iron?

531
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,536
I don’t know.
I have to try that.

532
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:02,371
Where’s Chad? Isn’t he
supposed to meet you here?

533
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:03,831
Claire?
Chad.

534
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:06,834
Oh, God, I’m so glad
you’re still here.

535
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:09,670
Oh, my God,
This is destiny.
My car runs out of gas.

536
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,463
Okay, so my gas gauge

00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,090
Yeah, but the
"I love you" thing.

893
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:42,717
You never trust a guy

894
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:45,553
who throws the term
"I love you" around loosely.

895
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:48,973
Guys like that
lack passion in their lives,

896
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:52,143
and they’re not thinking
about the girl they say it to,

897
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:54,061
and what it makes
her think.

898
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:55,896
It’s 1:32.

899
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:57,732
It’s 1:32, Claire!

900
00:46:57,732 --> 00:47:00,818
Hey, little man, go get us
some fire, matches.

901
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,486
 Ándale.

902
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,155
It’s so weird.
It’s so weird.

903
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:06,240
He’s not calling.
He’s not gonna call.

904
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,701
What do I do?
What do I do?

905
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:12,329
What do I know?
You just feel it out,
and you go up to the guy,

906
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:14,874
and he can either deal,
or he can’t.

907
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:17,001
There’s a problem?
Okay.

908
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:21,213
Then you say, "Hey, Chad,
what crawled up your ass?

909
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:23,549
"Will it be coming out
in the near future?

910
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:27,053
"No? Okay, then.
See ya.

911
00:47:27,053 --> 00:47:28,888
"I’m a smart, sexy hard-ass

912
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:31,766
who will now be moving on
to someone better."

913
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:33,059
Enough said.

914
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:34,060
Fire.

915
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:36,228
Where’s my gin?

916
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:37,730
Mike, go get
some more gin.

917
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:39,231
God, Claire!

918
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:41,609
Mike, you’re fired.

919
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:42,735
[pager beeps]

920
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:45,529
You’re always pageable.

921
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:51,744
Where are you going?
I’ll be right back.

922
00:48:42,962 --> 00:48:45,381
Claire.
Hi.

923
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:47,424
Hi. Uh, I can’t come
out to play right now.

924
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,552
I got this
important audition
I’m preparing for.

925
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:51,846
Oh, no, no, no. I was
just in the neighborhood,

926
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:53,806
so I thought
I’d stop by.

927
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:55,516
It was just--
It was kinda weird

928
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:57,685
the last time
we saw each other.

929
00:48:57,685 --> 00:48:59,770
When, last night?
It wasn’t weird last night.

930
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,356
Okay, well, maybe
it wasn’t weird,
but you haven’t called,

931
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,608
so I thought
something was wrong.

932
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:07,444
Claire, I just woke up
an hour ago, okay?

933
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:14,160
Well, maybe we could
do something tonight.

934
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,704
Um...

935
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:18,289
yeah.

936
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:20,457
Yeah. Uh, actually,
I’m gonna stay in tonight.

937
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:22,126
I got this throat thing.

938
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:24,128
Are you sick?
No.

939
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:25,754
Well...

940
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,756
I’m sorry. Look,
I just wanna feel good

941
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:29,925
for my audition
tomorrow.

942
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:33,554
Well, maybe we could
do something tomorrow night.

943
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:37,558
Yeah. Okay.

944
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:39,643
Okay, so I’ll call you
tomorrow night.

945
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,395
All right.
Thursday night.

946
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:44,773
I could have just said
Thursday night.

947
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,032
Bye.

948
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,418
Fuck!

949
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:15,888
Neal.

950
00:50:15,888 --> 00:50:17,306
Hey, Claire,
how’s it going?

951
00:50:18,474 --> 00:50:20,142
Fine. How are you?

952
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:21,644
I’m good.

953
00:50:21,644 --> 00:50:23,103
What are you
doing here?

954
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,022
I’m grocery shopping.

955
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:27,149
In the feminine
hygiene section?

956
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:28,651
Yeah, well,
you know how it is.

957
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:33,989
My mom asked me to pick up
some, um, some Monostat 7.

958
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:35,741
Nah, she--

959
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,326
She didn’t tell me
to pick it up.

960
00:50:37,326 --> 00:50:38,827
She doesn’t have
a yeast infection.

961
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:40,829
I mean, if she does,
she probably wouldn’t--

962
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:42,373
No.

963
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:45,459
Hey, have-- have you
spoken to April?

964
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:47,336
Yeah.

965
00:50:47,336 --> 00:50:48,629
Yeah?
Yeah.

966
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:50,506
I haven’t spoken to her.

967
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:52,049
If you talk to her
later or something,

968
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,968
can you tell her
that I, um...

969
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:56,679
that I say hello
and I love you and--

970
00:50:56,679 --> 00:51:01,100
Neal, I’m gonna
give you some advice.

971
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,643
Advice is nice sometimes.

972
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:04,019
You can take it
or leave it.

973
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:06,355
But April is
fucking with you.

974
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:08,315
She’s stringing
you along.

975
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:10,943
I think you should save
yourself some dignity

976
00:51:10,943 --> 00:51:12,945
and move on
with your life.

977
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:18,284
Is that it?

978
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:20,828
Yeah.

979
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:24,373
Thank you.

980
00:51:24,373 --> 00:51:27,710
It’s not that I don’t
think it could
lead somewhere.

981
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:31,880
 It’s just I decided
 that it’s best
 if it doesn’t.

982
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,008
Yeah?

983
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:37,720
The commitment issue’s
been exhausted, you know?

984
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,346
I wanna make
a clean break

985
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,889
and breathe
a little.

986
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:42,182
Oh, completely.

987
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:43,809
Yeah, I completely
understand, Neal.

988
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:46,061
I can see where
you’re coming from.

989
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:48,564
Good.

990
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:49,940
I mean,
you understand--

991
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,650
Oh, yeah, totally.

992
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,944
So do you want
to figure out how to...

993
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,571
get your stuff
out of my apartment?

994
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:56,864
Let me just
ask you something.

995
00:51:56,864 --> 00:52:00,367
Why the sudden shift
in attitude? I’m curious.

996
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:01,869
Hmm?
Huh?

997
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:04,747
When you guys
first broke up,
did he cheat on you?

998
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:07,207
No, no. It was only
for, like two days,

999
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:08,917
and he came running back
with flowers.

1000
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:10,544
Plus, Mitchell’s
not one of those guys

1001
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:12,546
that can get laid
just like that.

1002
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:14,631
I think he give
most girls the creeps.

1003
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:16,717
I love flowers.
Mmm.

1004
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:18,635
Claire, darling.

1005
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:21,221
So what’s with you
advising Neal to
break up with me?

1006
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:23,140
He broke up with you?

1007
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,224
Yes, he did.

1008
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:27,144
Wow. Good for him.

1009
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:29,063
Good for him?

1010
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:31,440
Why are you all of
a sudden interested
in my love life?

1011
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,567
First, I’d be careful
in calling it a love life.

1012
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:36,028
Second, Neal is my friend.

1013
00:52:36,028 --> 00:52:38,655
I thought I’d crack the door,
let a little light in.

1014
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:41,200
I’d do the same
for you, April.

1015
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,285
[laughs]
Really?

1016
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:44,995
Ooh, this is good,
Claire.

1017
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,372
Let me just
absorb this.

1018
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:47,873
You’re wrong for Neal.

1019
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:50,626
He deserves better, something
a little more dignified.

1020
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:52,711
You know, you’re right,
actually,

1021
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:54,671
’cause I thought
you and Neal would make
such a good couple.

1022
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,548
No. No, no.

1023
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:59,009
I would never fuck
my best friend’s boyfriend.

1024
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,969
Hmm. I would.

1025
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:03,263
Hey, can I interject here
for a second?

1026
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:06,183
Yeah, sure, Jason.
Go ahead, interject.

1027
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:07,726
We’re dying to hear you.

1028
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:09,937
Just by rare chance

1029
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:12,648
if you might find yourself in
the same room as a dictionary,

1030
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:14,650
why don’t you look up
the word devotion?

1031
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:16,693
And, uh, you know,
while you’re at it,

1032
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:18,278
you can even check out
some of the synonyms,

1033
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:22,408
like, uh, faithfulness,
or loyalty, or fidelity, or--

1034
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:23,700
monogamy’s a good one.

1035
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,744
Wow. This coming
from someone

1036
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:27,121
who’s never even had
a real girlfriend?

1037
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:29,957
No, no! Oh, God, no!

1038
00:53:29,957 --> 00:53:32,292
Coming from someone who’s
never been a real girlfriend.

1039
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:34,878
Oh, Jason, you sure
you’re only 5’5".

1040
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:36,880
You know what?
Merely because I’m
one of the two guys

1041
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,550
in our graduating class that
you did not go to bed with,

1042
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:41,635
that doesn’t mean
I haven’t been around, April.

1043
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:43,429
I’ve been around.

1044
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:46,181
 I’ve been approached.
 I’ve been stopped.

1045
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:49,143
I’ve been sought after
by-- by women

1046
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:52,229
who-- who make you look
like what you look like.

1047
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:55,149
6’2" and--

1048
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:57,443
[laughs]
Good for you.
You’ve been around.

1049
00:53:57,443 --> 00:53:58,861
Good.
What’s the point?

1050
00:53:58,861 --> 00:54:00,654
Hey, you know what?
Let me ask you something.

1051
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:03,824
How does it feel to have
the biggest pussy known
to mankind, huh?

1052
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:06,243
You’re really trying
my patience, Jason.

1053
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:07,911
That’s really funny.

1054
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,747
Yeah, well, you’re
looking a little spent there.

1055
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,249
Listen,
you little faggot.

1056
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:14,501
You want me to
drag you out by your
puny little cock

1057
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:16,962
and take away what
manhood you have left?
’Cause I’ll do it!

1058
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:18,797
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna blow me to death?

1059
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:20,048
Oh!

1060
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:23,427
Ugh!

1061
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:25,804
Are you okay, Jas?
No.

1062
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:29,975
Here.

You pledged your
eternal love to her,

1086
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:46,176
and she completely
blew you off.

Yeah, but see--
No. No, that doesn’t matter.

You know why?

1089

 looking like an asshole.

I mean, what if she
felt the same way,

1091
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:01,024
and she was just
too shy with me?

1092

Yeah.

it’s slang. All right.

01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:01,749
This about this.
Okay. Sure.

1237
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:03,126
[Waitress]
You guys all right?

1238
01:06:03,126 --> 01:06:04,919
I would like
another drink.

1239
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:06,671
Jason?
No, thank you.
I’m fine.

1240
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:09,883
Um, could you pour that
a little strong?

1241
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:12,594
Thank you. Where was I?

1242
01:06:12,594 --> 01:06:16,347
Okay, she opens
he beloved journal.

1243
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:19,976
[laughs]
Wouldn’t you know?
It’s Chad and Claire.

1244
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:22,604
How you doing,
Chad and Claire?

1245
01:06:24,689 --> 01:06:26,482
I hate him.

1246
01:06:28,443 --> 01:06:30,361
He’s a bad boy.

1247
01:06:30,361 --> 01:06:32,197
[laughs]

1248
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:35,700
Won’t be needing this.

1249
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,827
You’re lighting it
on fire right now.

1250
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:40,872
It’s on fire.
It’s embarrassing.
Put that out.

1251
01:06:40,872 --> 01:06:42,165
Mitchell, hi!

1252
01:06:42,165 --> 01:06:44,542
April. April.

1253
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:46,669
April.
Yes, Claire?

1254
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:47,795
Come here.
I gotta talk.

1255
01:06:47,795 --> 01:06:49,422
This is my friend Stephen.

1256
01:06:49,422 --> 01:06:53,176
Stephen, can you give me
one moment with April,
please? One moment?

1257
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:55,803
She’s really rude.
One moment.

1258
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:57,847
What?

1259
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:00,475
I have something
extremely important
to tell you.

1260
01:07:00,475 --> 01:07:03,728
That’s fine. Because I have
something extremely
important to tell you.

1261
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:06,606
Okay, listen, listen.
I-- I fucked up, okay?

1262
01:07:06,606 --> 01:07:08,650
I did.
I’m a bad person.

1263
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:10,276
You are good.

1264
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:12,362
I didn’t mean to say
those things to Neal.

1265
01:07:12,362 --> 01:07:14,489
And it’s my fault.

1266
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:16,366
So fucking-A!

1267
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:20,662
I just don’t see how
you can piss someone
like that away.

1268
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:22,747
Why don’t you have
another drink, Claire?

1269
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:24,832
It’s on the way.

1270
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:27,210
Um, I’m gonna throw up
right now,

1271
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:29,337
and I’ll see you
in a minute.

1272
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:33,883
Chad fucked
another girl.

1273
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:34,759
What?

1274
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:39,305
That’s terrible.

1275
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:40,848
[high-pitched voice]
Hi, April!

1276
01:07:40,848 --> 01:07:42,433
Shut up, Jason.

1277
01:07:46,271 --> 01:07:48,481
[gargles]

1278
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:50,400

1279
01:07:56,155 --> 01:07:58,116
[spits]

1280
01:08:02,704 --> 01:08:05,248
Claire, are you okay?

1281
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:07,709
I’m good.
I’m really...

1282
01:08:07,709 --> 01:08:11,629
really fucking good.

1283
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:14,799
Are you sure?

1284
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:20,805
April, has anyone
ever loved you?

1285
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:23,099
I mean, not your
blowjobs or your facades,

1286
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:26,477
but I mean really
loved you?

1287
01:08:26,477 --> 01:08:28,688
Like unconditional,
all the way.

1288
01:08:28,688 --> 01:08:32,108
 Like-- Like...
 in a soulful way?

1289
01:08:34,902 --> 01:08:37,196
I don’t know.

1290
01:08:37,196 --> 01:08:40,366
’Cause I haven’t
had that.

1291
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:43,494
[sniffles]

1292
01:08:43,494 --> 01:08:45,038
Is that all right?

1293
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:47,332
[crying]

1294
01:08:47,332 --> 01:08:51,210
I mean, is now the time
for me to grow hard

1295
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:55,006
and not ever care,
not ever want it?

1296
01:08:56,424 --> 01:09:00,303
No. No, Claire.

1297
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:05,183
Maybe you did have it,
and you just didn’t see it.

1298
01:09:05,183 --> 01:09:08,269
Oh.

1299
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:11,314
I thought what I had with
the Chad guy was real.

1300
01:09:11,314 --> 01:09:15,651
I mean, I thought
we both really had
jumped in together.

1301
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:18,529
But really I was just
swimming in my own piss,

1302
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:20,573
and he’s on
the diving board

1303
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:23,785
fucking some other girl.

1304
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:32,001
Okay, Claire, listen.
Listen to me, okay?

1305
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:34,962
Just--You have to pull
yourself together, okay?

1306
01:09:34,962 --> 01:09:38,633
This isn’t--
This isn’t you at all.

1307
01:09:38,633 --> 01:09:40,093
There’s plenty of guys
out there

1308
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:41,969
that would
love to be with you.

1309
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:45,807
He doesn’t know
what he’s missing, all right?

1310
01:09:45,807 --> 01:09:49,977
Listen, just keep
your cool, Claire.

1311
01:09:49,977 --> 01:09:51,312
It’s the best revenge.

1312
01:09:51,312 --> 01:09:53,648
I know.

1313
01:09:53,648 --> 01:09:56,192
I know you know,

1314
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:57,735
’cause you know
everything.

1315
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:19,757
Happy Halloween,
everybody.

1316
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:21,300
I’d like to have
your attention.

1317
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,552

1318
01:10:22,552 --> 01:10:24,887

a bon voyage party

Are we even invited?

This is
my sister’s house.

1331

This is
my sister’s party.

1332

Hi!

1368

You wore a costume!
Of course!

1369
01:12:41,315 --> 01:12:43,442
I’m very festive.
Oh, I’ll bet!

get a drink.

So what’s with Tinker Bell?

1373
01:12:52,285 --> 01:12:53,828
Are you trying
to make me jealous now?

1374
01:12:53,828 --> 01:12:55,955
No, that’s my date.

1375
01:12:55,955 --> 01:12:57,123
It’s a bona fide
date, April.

1376
01:12:57,123 --> 01:12:59,875
That’s a hood ornament,
that’s not a date.

I’m not trying
to make you jealous.

it’s the thought that counts.

Claire, it was me.

1383
01:13:43,878 --> 01:13:45,880
I slept with Chad.

1384
01:13:49,508 --> 01:13:51,510
I just thought
you should know about it.

1385
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:53,888
I’m meant to assume
this is recently,

1386
01:13:53,888 --> 01:13:56,057
as in the night
before last?

1387
01:13:57,975 --> 01:14:00,936
Yeah, I don’t--
Enough. Enough.

1388
01:14:00,936 --> 01:14:03,022
But may I commend you

1389
01:14:03,022 --> 01:14:05,566
on sinking to such
an astounding depth,

1390
01:14:05,566 --> 01:14:07,777
or would that be
pushing the issue?

01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:17,745
Claire, would you
just let me--

1392
01:14:17,745 --> 01:14:20,331
April, get out!

1393
01:14:20,331 --> 01:14:21,415

Just leave! Please!

break up with me!

Leave!

01:14:25,836 --> 01:14:27,171

that I’m sorry

I’m here with. April.

Just one question
for you.

1404
01:14:38,724 --> 01:14:41,977
Did you fuck her,
or did you make love to her?

1405
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:44,063
That’s good, Claire.
What?

01:15:23,728 --> 01:15:26,063
You all right?

1410
01:16:22,536 --> 01:16:25,331
Neal...

1411
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:29,293
just so you know,
I am sorry.

1412
01:16:29,293 --> 01:16:30,503
About what?

1413
01:16:30,503 --> 01:16:32,046
Everything.

1414
01:16:32,046 --> 01:16:36,967
This whole past year,
our relationship...

1415
01:16:36,967 --> 01:16:40,888
I don’t think you can
call what we had
a relationship, April.

1416
01:16:43,891 --> 01:16:48,229
I’m not as ungrateful
as I act, you know.

1417
01:16:48,229 --> 01:16:51,941
I mean, do you think
I don’t see who you are?

1418
01:16:54,527 --> 01:17:00,366
I mean, do you know that
I think you’re a beautiful,

1419
01:17:00,366 --> 01:17:04,161
special,
compassionate person?

1420
01:17:05,996 --> 01:17:09,750
[crying]
That’s what I think of you.

1421
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:16,340
And I never intended
to hurt you, you know?

1422
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:19,510
I don’t feel that you deserve
to be hurt that way.

1423
01:17:21,428 --> 01:17:24,807
I just don’t
understand myself.

1424
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:36,443
I better go inside.

1425
01:17:45,244 --> 01:17:46,579
[car door closes]

1426
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:52,877
April.

1427
01:18:04,471 --> 01:18:05,806
Thank you.

1428
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:17,109
Can I call you tomorrow?

1429
01:18:22,156 --> 01:18:25,701
I’d be very happy
if you call me tomorrow.

1430
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:27,578
I’ll call you tomorrow.

1431
01:18:30,331 --> 01:18:32,333
Good night.

1432
01:18:38,589 --> 01:18:40,215
Okay.

1433
01:18:44,428 --> 01:18:46,889
Aah!

1434
01:18:51,352 --> 01:18:53,145

1435
01:18:55,314 --> 01:18:57,483

01:19:01,362 --> 01:19:02,821

1438
01:19:15,918 --> 01:19:18,212
 I met him at
 a magazine stand.

 Chad fucked another girl.

Good morning.
Morning.

Is everything okay?
I’m fine.

The front of the car,
please?

Are you drunk?

No.

1460
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:42,713
Ma’am, it seems
to me like you’ve had

1461
01:20:42,713 --> 01:20:44,423
a little too much
to drink.

1462
01:20:44,423 --> 01:20:46,675
My name’s not ma’am.
It’s Claire.

1463
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:48,302
All right, Claire.

1464

out here this early?

I just came back from
a Halloween party.

Uh-huh.

Around.

Get in the car.
I’m giving you a ride.

No, no.
Actually, you know what?

1472
01:21:07,571 --> 01:21:10,532
I made it this far.
It’s not that far. I’m okay.

1473
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:12,618
Claire, I just
came back from an
arson investigation.

1474
01:21:12,618 --> 01:21:14,661
There could be a lunatic
on the streets.
It’s not safe.

Wow. Arson.
Yeah.
