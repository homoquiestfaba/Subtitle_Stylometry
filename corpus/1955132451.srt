00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,391
- Can get lost.
- I understand.

177
00:17:22,393 --> 00:17:25,205
- What if I want to hire a guide?
- No guide. Come back.

178
00:17:25,207 --> 00:17:27,222
- Maybe more bodies.
- No.

179
00:17:27,224 --> 00:17:29,591
She's lost. She's not dead.

180
00:17:29,593 --> 00:17:33,172
Do not leave the path.

181
00:17:41,497 --> 00:17:43,670
Shit.

182
00:17:48,888 --> 00:17:51,670
Hey. It's mountain.

183
00:17:51,672 --> 00:17:54,644
Lots of metal. Cell
phone do not work up here.

184
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,719
Do you know the forest?

185
00:17:57,721 --> 00:18:00,343
Could you take me in? I'd pay you.

186
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:03,158
The forest has <i>yurei.</i>
Everybody know that.

187
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,566
<i>Yurei.</i>

188
00:18:04,568 --> 00:18:06,615
You mean ghosts?

189
00:18:06,617 --> 00:18:08,214
<i>Yurei.</i>

190
00:18:08,216 --> 00:18:10,711
Different from ghost.

191
00:18:10,713 --> 00:18:13,046
The forest use them to trick you.

192
00:18:13,048 --> 00:18:16,340
Do you know why "do not leave the path"?

193
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:18,614
Because if you get lost

194
00:18:18,616 --> 00:18:21,462
and you have sadness in your heart,

195
00:18:21,817 --> 00:18:23,862
they will use it against you.

196
00:18:23,864 --> 00:18:25,782
<i>Yurei</i> come find you

197
00:18:25,784 --> 00:18:28,086
and make you see things

198
00:18:28,088 --> 00:18:30,550
and make you want to die.

199
00:18:30,552 --> 00:18:33,239
And you do it yourself.

200
00:18:33,241 --> 00:18:35,477
Okay.

201
00:18:36,217 --> 00:18:38,615
Thanks for that.

202
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,717
If the <i>yurei</i> are looking
for me, I'll be at my hotel.

203
00:18:59,385 --> 00:19:03,669
(rustling)

204
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,645
(girls giggling)

205
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:25,909
(people chattering)

206
00:19:29,624 --> 00:19:32,950
- (chattering continues)
- <i>♪♪ (speakers: dance pop)</i>

207
00:19:46,168 --> 00:19:48,661
- (Japanese)
- Thanks.

208
00:19:53,528 --> 00:19:55,542
You look familiar. Have we met?

209
00:19:55,544 --> 00:19:57,974
Here? Four days ago?

210
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:00,533
Uh, hey, sorry.

211
00:20:00,535 --> 00:20:03,574
I don't know you. I was
just a line to start a chat.

212
00:20:03,576 --> 00:20:06,518
"Have you ever been to Greece? Did you go
to Camp Minnehaha in the Rocky Mountains?"

213
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,077
- That kind of thing.
- Right.

214
00:20:10,073 --> 00:20:12,887
I thought you might
have met my sister, Jess.

215
00:20:12,889 --> 00:20:16,214
She came here... and disappeared.

216
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,772
Do you know about the forest?

217
00:20:18,904 --> 00:20:20,311
Yeah.

218
00:20:20,313 --> 00:20:22,551
Is that a possibility with your sister?

219
00:20:22,553 --> 00:20:26,196
We're identical twins. If she
were dead, I would just know.

220
00:20:28,601 --> 00:20:32,917
What do you think she's up
to then, if she's out there?

221
00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:37,492
I think she's struggling with her demons.

222
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:40,148
Yeah, it happens.

223
00:20:41,464 --> 00:20:46,293
Some people go in. They do sort
of a walkabout, think it over.

224
00:20:46,807 --> 00:20:49,301
Sometimes they come back out again.

225
00:20:50,648 --> 00:20:52,117
I'm Aiden, by the way.

226
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:55,574
Oh. Sara.

227
00:20:55,863 --> 00:20:57,399
Sara. Pleasure to meet you.

228
00:20:57,401 --> 00:20:59,637
You too.

229
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,325
That's her, a couple of years ago.

230
00:21:07,961 --> 00:21:11,060
- Same, right?
- Identical.

231
00:21:11,705 --> 00:21:15,030
Uh... (Japanese)

232
00:21:16,344 --> 00:21:19,062
- Sisters.
- (Japanese)

233
00:21:19,064 --> 00:21:21,078
- No.
- No, he's never seen her.

234
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,934
Are you fluent?

235
00:21:22,936 --> 00:21:27,253
Yeah. I live in Tokyo. I write for
a travel magazine out of Australia.

236
00:21:29,624 --> 00:21:31,830
- So, did you?
- Huh?

237
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,231
Go to Camp Minnehaha
in the Rocky Mountains?

238
00:21:34,233 --> 00:21:35,734
(laughs) No.

239
00:21:35,736 --> 00:21:39,254
No, I was lucky. I... I went to space camp.

240
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,142
- Oh, space camp.
- Yeah. Lots of fun.

241
00:21:41,144 --> 00:21:42,838
(both laughing)

242
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,750
- All alone?
- Yeah.

243
00:21:45,752 --> 00:21:48,278
- What?
- (laughing) No.

244
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,166
- What?
- No, you'll get lost.

245
00:21:50,168 --> 00:21:51,990
- (mutters)
- Trust me.

246
00:21:51,992 --> 00:21:54,839
Trust me. You will. I've been
in the forest a hundred times.

247
00:21:54,841 --> 00:21:57,749
<i>I</i> don't go in alone.
I can't let you do that.

248
00:21:57,751 --> 00:22:01,175
Well, good thing I don't need
your permission, guy I just met.

249
00:22:01,177 --> 00:22:04,503
I have clearance to go with the park
nature guard tomorrow for my article.

250
00:22:04,505 --> 00:22:07,478
He goes on rounds every few
days, kinda like a suicide watch.

251
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,230
He knows the park better than
anyone. I could ask if you could come.

252
00:22:10,232 --> 00:22:12,853
- That would be great.
- One thing though. A favor, if you wouldn't mind.

253
00:22:12,855 --> 00:22:14,711
Yeah?

254
00:22:14,713 --> 00:22:18,391
Your search for your sister,
it's gripping, it's human.

255
00:22:18,393 --> 00:22:19,989
- I mean, it's an article.
- Oh.

256
00:22:19,991 --> 00:22:22,806
- I'd like your permission to write about it.
- Right.

257
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,822
Will I be a celebrity in Australia?

258
00:22:24,824 --> 00:22:27,221
- Do you want to be a celebrity in Australia?
- Nope.

259
00:22:27,223 --> 00:22:29,494
Are you sure? You might
like it. You never know.

260
00:22:29,496 --> 00:22:32,822
Is it all right if I record you for the
story? For my own notes, for accuracy?

261
00:22:32,824 --> 00:22:35,093
- Uh-huh.
- You have to say "yes" out loud.

262
00:22:35,095 --> 00:22:36,726
"Yes out loud."

263
00:22:36,728 --> 00:22:38,551
Thank you.

264
00:22:38,553 --> 00:22:41,814
So you and Jess were
raised by your grandmother.

265
00:22:41,816 --> 00:22:45,718
And you believe she's okay because you
have this kind of mystical twin connection.

266
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,511
It's not mystical.

267
00:22:47,513 --> 00:22:50,999
It's just when something happens to
one of us, the other one can tell.

268
00:22:51,001 --> 00:22:54,293
I mean, usually it's something happening
to her and me coming to bail her out, but...

269
00:22:54,295 --> 00:22:56,213
Yeah. I've got a little brother myself.

270
00:22:56,215 --> 00:22:59,702
He's a good kid. Just, he can't
seem to stay out of trouble.

271
00:22:59,704 --> 00:23:03,830
Jess is the same. She never learns.

272
00:23:03,832 --> 00:23:07,446
When we were little, no
one could tell us apart.

273
00:23:07,448 --> 00:23:11,380
It was like we were the same person.

274
00:23:12,248 --> 00:23:15,126
Do you mind if I ask what
happened to your parents?

275
00:23:15,128 --> 00:23:17,653
No, it's totally fine.

276
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,078
It was a car accident. We were six.

277
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,343
They had gone to a movie. Grandma
was over. She was watching us.

278
00:23:24,345 --> 00:23:26,614
MAN (shouting, muffled):
What is wrong with you?

279
00:23:26,616 --> 00:23:29,621
WOMAN (muffled): Put that
down. You're scaring me!

280
00:23:29,623 --> 00:23:33,623
They were supposed to be back any
minute. We heard this crash outside.

281
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:35,956
(gunshot)

282
00:23:39,032 --> 00:23:42,100
(shotgun cocks, fires)

283
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:46,837
Grandma rushed outside. We followed her.

284
00:23:48,025 --> 00:23:50,294
It was a drunk driver.

285
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:53,717
<i>He'd been doing 60 in a
residential neighborhood.</i>

286
00:23:53,719 --> 00:23:55,990
<i>Hit them right as they
turned into the driveway.</i>

287
00:23:55,992 --> 00:23:59,317
Jess was in front of me. She saw it first.

288
00:24:00,535 --> 00:24:02,486
(Grandma gasps)

289
00:24:02,488 --> 00:24:05,716
Jess told me later their bodies
were right there on the lawn.

290
00:24:06,552 --> 00:24:08,470
Close your eyes!

291
00:24:08,472 --> 00:24:11,319
Don't look! Don't look!

292
00:24:11,321 --> 00:24:13,046
(audio drops out)

293
00:24:13,048 --> 00:24:16,660
I kept my eyes closed, but she saw it all.

294
00:24:18,744 --> 00:24:20,597
Jesus.

295
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,669
- Did they ever catch the guy?
- What guy?

296
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:27,733
- The... The drunk driver?
- Oh, no. No.

297
00:24:30,233 --> 00:24:32,981
Hey. I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to dredge all that stuff up.

298
00:24:32,983 --> 00:24:35,924
Oh, it's fine. Long time ago.

299
00:24:38,265 --> 00:24:41,621
- Mmm. Cheers.
- Cheers.

300
00:25:06,743 --> 00:25:09,366
<i>Hi. This is Rob. Sorry I
can't get to the phone.</i>

301
00:25:09,368 --> 00:25:11,380
- <i>Please leave a message.</i>
- <i>(beeps)</i>

302
00:25:12,313 --> 00:25:14,388
Fine.

303
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,165

304
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,932

314
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:33,428
She's elderly.

316

- (beeps)
- <i>(line ringing)</i>

318
00:27:08,025 --> 00:27:10,582
ROB: <i>Hey, babe. I got your message.</i>

319
00:27:10,584 --> 00:27:12,854
<i>It's nice to finally hear
your voice. I miss you.</i>

320
00:27:12,856 --> 00:27:16,981
<i>But you going into this forest
alone, it sounds really dangerous.</i>

321
00:27:16,983 --> 00:27:19,991
<i>If I don't hear back from you
soon, I am hopping on a plane.</i>

322
00:27:19,993 --> 00:27:22,004
<i>So just come home. Please.</i>

323
00:27:25,879 --> 00:27:29,428
(speaking Japanese)

324
00:27:29,687 --> 00:27:30,807
- Morning.
- AIDEN: Morning.

325
00:27:30,809 --> 00:27:32,598
Michi, this is Sara.

326
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,413
Hello. Thanks for this.

327
00:27:35,415 --> 00:27:37,558
Michi does these suicide
watch hikes off the books.

328
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,373
That's very good of you.

329
00:27:40,952 --> 00:27:42,869
What?

330
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:45,046
You must understand,

331
00:27:45,048 --> 00:27:47,126
after this long

332
00:27:47,128 --> 00:27:50,263
most people who go into the
forest to die are already dead.

333
00:27:50,265 --> 00:27:52,117
She's not dead.

334
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,308
Do you have family?

335
00:27:56,472 --> 00:27:58,262
- I have children.
- Okay.

336
00:27:58,264 --> 00:28:00,789
If this was your child,

337
00:28:01,207 --> 00:28:04,340
if you knew she was lost and in pain,

338
00:28:05,207 --> 00:28:08,277
you'd do anything to help, wouldn't you?

339
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:10,805
I can't prove to you that I'm right.

340
00:28:10,807 --> 00:28:13,686
All I can do is ask you to
understand where I'm coming from.

341
00:28:13,688 --> 00:28:15,574
- I still think you should not go.
- Why?

342
00:28:15,576 --> 00:28:18,388
Because you're sad.

343
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,525
- Okay?
- Let's go.

344
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:58,071
<i>Jukai</i> means "sea of trees."

345
00:28:58,073 --> 00:29:00,118
If you look down from Mount Fuji,

346
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,581
the forest looks like an ocean.

347
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,381
There's ice caves beneath the forest.

348
00:29:07,383 --> 00:29:09,813
There's whole sections that
have never been explored.

349
00:29:09,815 --> 00:29:13,267
Some people believe it's a
gateway to the other side.

350
00:29:33,367 --> 00:29:36,948
(faint screeching, echoing)

351
00:30:01,304 --> 00:30:03,795
AIDEN: Sara!

352
00:30:09,303 --> 00:30:11,605
Take a look at this.

353
00:30:13,016 --> 00:30:16,053
Okay, that's weird. Why is that happening?

354
00:30:16,055 --> 00:30:18,005
Iron deposits in the
mountain. It's crazy, huh?

355
00:30:18,007 --> 00:30:20,500
- Yeah.
- Look.

356
00:30:21,431 --> 00:30:24,502
People sometimes see things in the forest.

357
00:30:24,504 --> 00:30:26,102
Important to remember.

358
00:30:26,104 --> 00:30:30,422
If you see anything bad, anything strange,

359
00:30:30,424 --> 00:30:32,692
it is not real.

360
00:30:32,888 --> 00:30:35,541
Okay? It's not there.

361
00:30:35,992 --> 00:30:37,972
It's here.

362
00:31:03,256 --> 00:31:05,557
- Watch out.
- I got it.

363
00:31:14,264 --> 00:31:17,781
(animal bellowing, faint)

364
00:31:21,144 --> 00:31:23,765
(bellowing continues)

365
00:31:41,016 --> 00:31:44,532
(insect buzzing)

366
00:31:45,176 --> 00:31:47,413
MICHI: Let's head this way.

367
00:32:17,111 --> 00:32:19,315
What's that?

368
00:32:20,632 --> 00:32:23,381
If you bring a tent, you're not sure.

369
00:32:24,216 --> 00:32:26,228
Stay here.

370
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,013
(Michi speaking Japanese)

371
00:32:34,423 --> 00:32:36,628
(Japanese)

372
00:32:40,663 --> 00:32:44,180
What will you do if we
don't find your sister today?

373
00:32:48,184 --> 00:32:50,261
Try again tomorrow.

374
00:32:51,671 --> 00:32:54,612
What if we don't find her tomorrow?

375
00:32:59,192 --> 00:33:01,942
(Japanese continues)

376
00:33:01,944 --> 00:33:05,622
How does it feel to be in the
forest where she disappeared?

377
00:33:05,624 --> 00:33:07,637
It feels...

378
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:10,933
necessary.

379
00:33:20,247 --> 00:33:23,604
Jess ever tried suicide before?

380
00:33:26,808 --> 00:33:29,014
She was living in Florida a few years ago

381
00:33:29,016 --> 00:33:31,062
and one night she wasn't
picking up the phone.

382
00:33:31,064 --> 00:33:33,013
I just knew something was wrong.

383
00:33:33,015 --> 00:33:35,477
I got 911 to check on her.

384
00:33:35,479 --> 00:33:38,486
They found her unconscious.
She'd taken some sleeping pills.

385
00:33:38,488 --> 00:33:41,205
That was the second time.
First time was back in college.

386
00:33:41,207 --> 00:33:43,444
- Pills then too?
- Mm-hmm.

387
00:33:43,446 --> 00:33:47,094
I mean, knowing Jess, she probably
just thought it was romantic,

388
00:33:47,096 --> 00:33:50,806
following in the footsteps
of her favorite poet.

389
00:33:50,808 --> 00:33:53,141
"Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree,

390
00:33:53,143 --> 00:33:55,094
if mankind perished utterly.

391
00:33:55,096 --> 00:33:56,789
And Spring herself..."

392
00:33:56,791 --> 00:34:01,172
"When she woke at dawn, would
scarcely know that we were gone."

393
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,429
Now, what's a guy like you
memorize Sara Teasdale for?

394
00:34:05,431 --> 00:34:07,957
(laughs)

395
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:10,837
Meet a lot of girls on
their junior year abroad?

396
00:34:10,839 --> 00:34:12,851
Whatever works.

397
00:34:16,503 --> 00:34:18,516
Hey, Michi, what happened?

398
00:34:20,823 --> 00:34:24,148
He will be okay, I think.

399
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,292
MICHI: Let's go.

400
00:34:42,423 --> 00:34:43,701
What's that?

401
00:34:43,703 --> 00:34:46,422
AIDEN: People use tape or rope like this

402
00:34:46,424 --> 00:34:48,693
if they think they might want
to find their way back out.

403
00:34:48,695 --> 00:34:51,189
Or they hope somebody will follow the rope

404
00:34:51,191 --> 00:34:54,579
to remove their body
from the forest one day.

405
00:34:57,239 --> 00:34:59,668
MICHI: This one looks recent.

406
00:35:17,304 --> 00:35:21,108
AIDEN: Doesn't look like anyone's
here. Maybe they changed their mind.

407
00:35:21,303 --> 00:35:23,957
(gasps)

408
00:35:32,343 --> 00:35:34,356
I must cut him down.

409
00:35:34,358 --> 00:35:36,662
- I'll make a note of where he is.
- AIDEN: Why?

410
00:35:36,664 --> 00:35:39,829
So the rangers can retrieve the body.

411
00:35:42,487 --> 00:35:44,660
(Michi speaking Japanese)

412
00:35:57,975 --> 00:36:00,852
(screeching, faint)

413
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:29,107
Michi. (Japanese)

414
00:36:29,495 --> 00:36:32,947
- (Japanese)
- Take a break.

415
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:51,283
(loud screech in distance)

416
00:37:13,207 --> 00:37:15,381
(woman, faint) <i>Help me.</i>

417
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:26,356
Can we go this way?

418
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:32,563
I mean, if we're just picking a direction.

419
00:37:42,264 --> 00:37:43,990
(scoffs)

420
00:37:43,992 --> 00:37:46,004
Come.

421
00:37:49,718 --> 00:37:51,732
SARA: Jess!

422
00:37:53,623 --> 00:37:55,667
Jess!

423
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:02,100
We must turn back soon.

424
00:38:02,102 --> 00:38:03,573
What, already?

425
00:38:03,575 --> 00:38:05,525
We're several hours from the trail.

426
00:38:05,527 --> 00:38:08,150
We do not stay in the forest after dark.

427
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:10,166
In the day, easy to get lost.

428
00:38:10,168 --> 00:38:15,732
At night, you're blind and
temperature drops quickly.

429
00:38:17,815 --> 00:38:19,988
Jess!

430
00:38:21,784 --> 00:38:24,148
Do you see something?

431
00:38:25,464 --> 00:38:27,412
Oh, my God, that's her tent.

432
00:38:27,414 --> 00:38:30,229
Jess! Jess!

433
00:38:30,231 --> 00:38:33,171
I knew it! Jess!

434
00:38:35,703 --> 00:38:38,869
It's her! It is! It's her! Oh, my God.

435
00:38:38,871 --> 00:38:43,219
Michi, you said if they bring a
tent, it means they're not sure.

436
00:38:43,767 --> 00:38:46,326
Oh, my God, she's close. She's so close.

437
00:38:46,328 --> 00:38:49,109
- Jess! Jess!
- Jess!

438
00:38:49,784 --> 00:38:52,116
Jess!

439
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:54,582
Jess? Hello!

440
00:38:54,584 --> 00:38:56,852
Hello?

441
00:39:00,822 --> 00:39:03,892
Since she's not here, we'll
come back tomorrow morning.

442
00:39:03,894 --> 00:39:05,908
- We must go now.
- We've got to stay.

443
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,758
We must go now. You can
leave a note for her.

444
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,701
Leave a note? Are you crazy? I'm
staying. I'm staying till she comes back.

445
00:39:11,703 --> 00:39:13,525
Aiden, tell him.

446
00:39:13,527 --> 00:39:15,573
No, he's right.

447
00:39:15,575 --> 00:39:17,524
- We can come back tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

448
00:39:17,526 --> 00:39:19,412
No, tomorrow is gonna be too late.

449
00:39:19,414 --> 00:39:22,901
She left the tent. She's gonna come back
to sleep. Her clothes are on the line.

450
00:39:22,903 --> 00:39:24,308
Sleeping here is foolish.

451
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:27,125
We'll not stop looking
for Jess... in the daytime.

452
00:39:27,127 --> 00:39:29,555
Now we must go.

453
00:39:30,103 --> 00:39:32,308
I understand.

454
00:39:32,886 --> 00:39:35,251
You two go. Go.

455
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,038
It's all right. I understand. You go.

456
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,406
You cannot stay!

457
00:39:40,408 --> 00:39:43,990
At night in the <i>jukai,</i>
people see bad things.

458
00:39:43,992 --> 00:39:47,157
Sometimes <i>do</i> bad
things. Very bad things.

459
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:50,198
The forest draws out
your fear, your sadness.

460
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,653
You believe in <i>yurei,</i> Michi? You
sound like the girl from the visitor center.

461
00:39:53,655 --> 00:39:56,405
I came 6,000 miles to find my sister.

462
00:39:56,407 --> 00:39:59,636
She's here in these woods.
I'm not leaving without her.

463
00:39:59,638 --> 00:40:01,781
Thanks for your help.

464
00:40:01,783 --> 00:40:04,373
I'm so grateful. Really.

465
00:40:04,375 --> 00:40:06,739
But I'm staying.

466
00:40:10,807 --> 00:40:13,267
Sara, you're making a big mistake.

467
00:40:17,783 --> 00:40:20,083
(sighs)

468
00:40:35,063 --> 00:40:38,644
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna stay here with you.

469
00:40:38,646 --> 00:40:40,789
- Don't be foolish, Aiden.
- It's fine.

470
00:40:40,791 --> 00:40:43,061
We'll stay here. We'll stay the
night. We'll watch after each other.

471
00:40:43,063 --> 00:40:46,550
- (Japanese)
- Hey.

472
00:40:46,552 --> 00:40:48,470
- We'll be fine.
- I'll come back tomorrow.

473
00:40:48,472 --> 00:40:50,900
Do not move from here. Okay?

474
00:40:57,816 --> 00:41:00,852
You don't have to do this.
It's my sister, not yours.

475
00:41:00,854 --> 00:41:04,339
Yeah, well, if it was my
brother, I'd stick around too.

476
00:41:06,456 --> 00:41:08,436
Thanks.

477
00:41:25,622 --> 00:41:28,469
I changed my mind. Let's
come back in the morning.

478
00:41:28,471 --> 00:41:30,580
Yeah. Very funny.

479
00:41:30,582 --> 00:41:33,523
Here. Give me a hand with this fire.

480
00:41:38,584 --> 00:41:41,493
No, not like that. Here. Like this.

481
00:41:41,495 --> 00:41:44,308
Like you're the expert.
You went to space camp.

482
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:47,765
I know you're not supposed to pile it
up like that. You gotta let it breathe.

483
00:41:47,767 --> 00:41:49,685
Okay. You mean up, like this?

484
00:41:49,687 --> 00:41:51,957
- Yeah. There you go.
- Okay.

485
00:41:51,959 --> 00:41:55,252
I salute your caveman skills.

486
00:41:58,231 --> 00:42:00,118
- Want one?
- What's this?

487
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:03,028
A Power Bar. Japanese version.

488
00:42:03,414 --> 00:42:05,619
They're pretty good.

489
00:42:13,752 --> 00:42:15,508
It's not bad.

490
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:22,325
You take the tent when you get tired.

491
00:42:22,327 --> 00:42:24,787
I'll stay out here by the fire.

492
00:42:25,432 --> 00:42:27,956
Avoid any awkwardness.

493
00:42:28,664 --> 00:42:31,252
A caveman <i>and</i> a gentleman.

494
00:42:37,047 --> 00:42:40,531
(insects chirping)

495
00:42:48,374 --> 00:42:51,156
(loud screech in distance)

496
00:42:56,247 --> 00:42:59,315
- What's that?
- I don't know.

497
00:43:00,023 --> 00:43:02,132
But I promise you they
have centipedes in Australia

498
00:43:02,134 --> 00:43:04,692
more dangerous than anything out here.

499
00:43:11,511 --> 00:43:14,068
Jess must be lost.

500
00:43:16,342 --> 00:43:18,292
She's close.

501
00:43:18,615 --> 00:43:20,788
And alive.

502
00:43:22,071 --> 00:43:24,275
Explain that to me.

503
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:26,900
It's like a sound.

504
00:43:26,902 --> 00:43:30,387
It's too low to hear, but I can just...

505
00:43:30,871 --> 00:43:32,884
feel it...

506
00:43:32,886 --> 00:43:34,677
running through me.

507
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:37,717
And that night I was telling
you about, when she almost died,

508
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:39,892
the sound dropped away.

509
00:43:40,374 --> 00:43:42,261
Where Jess had been,

510
00:43:42,263 --> 00:43:44,531
there was just...

511
00:43:45,398 --> 00:43:47,603
silence.

512
00:43:50,264 --> 00:43:54,996
You know, when we were kids,
my brother would start fights.

513
00:43:55,511 --> 00:43:57,364
And I never stepped in.

514
00:43:57,366 --> 00:44:00,403
Figured he needed to learn not
to start them in the first place.

515
00:44:01,398 --> 00:44:03,125
One day he got beat up so bad

516
00:44:03,127 --> 00:44:05,270
that it left him deaf in his left ear.

517
00:44:05,272 --> 00:44:09,748
And I remember seeing him,
and that feeling... just guilt.

518
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:12,307
So now whenever he's in
trouble, I come running.

519
00:44:13,015 --> 00:44:16,020
- I feel guilty too.
- What do you mean?

520
00:44:16,022 --> 00:44:17,877
My parents' bodies.

521
00:44:17,879 --> 00:44:20,468
I closed my eyes, but she looked.

522
00:44:22,263 --> 00:44:25,140
It's always been the difference between us.

523
00:44:25,142 --> 00:44:27,891
She looks at the dark
stuff and I turn away.

524
00:44:28,407 --> 00:44:30,582
What she saw,

525
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:33,012
she carried that all by herself.

526
00:44:33,014 --> 00:44:35,667
I should have shared it with her.

527
00:44:36,246 --> 00:44:39,411
That's why I come running.

528
00:44:44,663 --> 00:44:47,284
I'm going to try and get some sleep.

529
00:44:47,286 --> 00:44:49,267
Yeah.

530
00:45:51,255 --> 00:45:53,683
(rustling)

531
00:45:59,607 --> 00:46:01,812
(footsteps)

532
00:46:03,607 --> 00:46:05,780
Aiden?

533
00:46:07,479 --> 00:46:10,003
Aiden, say something.

534
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:14,196
(footsteps)

535
00:46:16,854 --> 00:46:19,700
(running footsteps)

536
00:46:24,662 --> 00:46:26,834
(screams)

537
00:46:35,031 --> 00:46:39,731
(loud screech in distance)

538
00:47:00,663 --> 00:47:02,643
(shrieks)

539
00:47:30,935 --> 00:47:33,523
(rustling)

540
00:47:49,751 --> 00:47:51,732
Hello?

541
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:57,235
Jess, is that you?

542
00:48:09,718 --> 00:48:11,795
Hey, wait.

543
00:48:14,646 --> 00:48:16,149
Wait.

544
00:48:16,151 --> 00:48:18,388
Please!

545
00:48:32,918 --> 00:48:34,899
Hi.

546
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:38,292
Do you speak English?

547
00:48:42,998 --> 00:48:44,915
Little.

548
00:48:46,487 --> 00:48:47,733
Hoshiko.

549
00:48:47,735 --> 00:48:51,282
Hoshiko, are you alone?

550
00:48:52,438 --> 00:48:53,973
You're cold. Let me help you.

551
00:48:53,975 --> 00:48:55,956
You Sara?

552
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:58,899
Yeah. How do you know my name?

553
00:49:01,175 --> 00:49:03,635
No trust him.

554
00:49:04,054 --> 00:49:05,715
Who?

555
00:49:05,814 --> 00:49:07,541
Miss Jess know him.

556
00:49:07,543 --> 00:49:09,523
Jess? Is Jess your teacher?

557
00:49:10,743 --> 00:49:13,396
I find her here.

558
00:49:14,134 --> 00:49:17,333
She say, "Need your help."

559
00:49:17,335 --> 00:49:21,460
- Where is she?
- No trust him.

560
00:49:21,462 --> 00:49:23,380
AIDEN: Sara!

561
00:49:23,382 --> 00:49:25,940
No, no, no, no! Wait!

562
00:49:27,159 --> 00:49:29,331
(gasps)

563
00:49:29,751 --> 00:49:31,732
Goddamn it.

564
00:49:33,718 --> 00:49:35,891
(groans)

565
00:49:36,694 --> 00:49:38,772
I lost her. I lost her.

566
00:49:38,774 --> 00:49:40,917
- Jesus. Look at your hand.
- Oh, God.

567
00:49:40,919 --> 00:49:43,188
Who? Who'd you lose? Jess?

568
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:45,492
No, it was...

569
00:49:45,494 --> 00:49:47,891
It was a teenage girl. She said...

570
00:49:47,893 --> 00:49:49,842
She said what?

571
00:49:50,071 --> 00:49:52,436
Something in Japanese.

572
00:49:52,438 --> 00:49:54,037
Oh, man.

573
00:49:54,039 --> 00:49:55,604
Well, we're not gonna find her

574
00:49:55,606 --> 00:49:56,949
if she doesn't wanna be found.

575
00:49:56,951 --> 00:49:59,250
We'll tell Michi.

576
00:50:00,342 --> 00:50:03,316
Okay, let's get back before
we get turned around. Come on.

577
00:50:03,318 --> 00:50:05,493
(groans)

578
00:50:05,495 --> 00:50:07,668
Come on.

579
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:13,235
(thunder rumbling)

580
00:50:14,999 --> 00:50:16,852
All right, kiddo. There's
enough light for us now.

581
00:50:16,854 --> 00:50:18,581
Let's get you out of here.

582
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:21,492
- But Michi said noon.
- Seven hours from now?

583
00:50:21,494 --> 00:50:23,412
No. Look at your hand. You need stitches.

584
00:50:23,414 --> 00:50:25,780
Let me worry about my hand.

585
00:50:25,782 --> 00:50:28,019
Jess might still come back.

586
00:50:32,918 --> 00:50:34,741
Sara.

587
00:50:34,743 --> 00:50:37,332
You just saw a child out in the woods
presumably contemplating suicide,

588
00:50:37,334 --> 00:50:39,188
considering that she ran from you.

589
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:41,940
We tell them that, they'll
send a search party quick.

590
00:50:41,942 --> 00:50:45,971
Maybe that search party
finds your sister. Make sense?

591
00:50:48,471 --> 00:50:50,261
In the meantime,

592
00:50:50,263 --> 00:50:52,980
in case your sister does
come back while we're gone,

593
00:50:52,982 --> 00:50:55,221
you do what you should've done yesterday.

594
00:50:55,223 --> 00:50:57,971
- (backpack zips)
- Leave a note.

595
00:51:06,965 --> 00:51:09,429
This is the way we came.

596
00:51:09,431 --> 00:51:11,157
We keep walking in this direction,

597
00:51:11,159 --> 00:51:13,748
we'll come to the path before too long.

598
00:51:33,398 --> 00:51:36,435
- We didn't pass the river coming in.
- Yeah, I know.

599
00:51:37,366 --> 00:51:39,125
But at least we can follow it down.

600
00:51:39,127 --> 00:51:40,628
It may take a little longer,

601
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:43,763
but it'll lead us back to
civilization just the same.

602
00:51:56,278 --> 00:51:58,197
Sara. Hey. Careful. Hey.

603
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:00,213
Hey, get back from there. Come on.

604
00:52:00,215 --> 00:52:03,347
- SARA: Do you see that?
- Jesus.

605
00:52:04,469 --> 00:52:06,101
Hey, come on.

606
00:52:06,103 --> 00:52:08,083
Get away from there. Come on.

607
00:52:11,798 --> 00:52:13,203
What are you doing?

608
00:52:13,205 --> 00:52:15,123
What do you mean?

609
00:52:15,125 --> 00:52:17,171
We were walking <i>that</i> way.

610
00:52:18,422 --> 00:52:19,861
- No, we weren't.
- Yes, we were.

611
00:52:19,863 --> 00:52:22,485
Two minutes ago, we were walking that way,

612
00:52:22,487 --> 00:52:24,724
and now you're leading
me back the way we came.

613
00:52:24,726 --> 00:52:28,340
No. Sara, we're following
the river down. Remember?

614
00:52:28,342 --> 00:52:30,611
We're not climbing the mountain.

615
00:52:30,902 --> 00:52:32,915
Down.

616
00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:35,730
Water flows down.

617
00:52:36,886 --> 00:52:38,900
See?

618
00:53:17,975 --> 00:53:19,925
SARA (on recording):
<i>I feel guilty too.</i>

619
00:53:19,927 --> 00:53:21,267
AIDEN (on recording):
<i>What do you mean?</i>

620
00:53:21,269 --> 00:53:23,156
SARA: <i>My parents' bodies.</i>

621
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:26,613
<i>I closed my eyes, but she looked.</i>

622
00:53:26,615 --> 00:53:30,549
- Hello!
- <i>That's always been the difference between us.</i>

623
00:53:30,551 --> 00:53:32,947
- Oh, shit.
- <i>She looks at the dark stuff and I turn away.</i>

624
00:53:32,949 --> 00:53:35,349
- <i>What she saw...</i>
- You recorded that?

625
00:53:35,351 --> 00:53:37,588
You gave me permission, the other day.

626
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:41,171
- That's why you questioned me so much last night.
- Yeah, I'm doing a story.

627
00:53:41,173 --> 00:53:43,890
That's why you stayed at the
campsite... for your story.

628
00:53:44,151 --> 00:53:45,941
In part.

629
00:53:45,943 --> 00:53:49,749
Also because I was concerned
about you... and your sister,

630
00:53:49,751 --> 00:53:51,253
and I liked you.

631
00:53:51,255 --> 00:53:54,101
- Do you even have a brother?
- Of course I do.

632
00:53:54,103 --> 00:53:56,243
What's his name?

633
00:53:57,527 --> 00:53:58,644
Mikey.

634
00:53:58,646 --> 00:54:01,907
- Which ear is he deaf in?
- His... His...

635
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:07,508
Okay, yes, I wanted to get
closer to you for the story.

636
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:11,253
Yes, but also mainly to get
closer to a pretty girl in the bar.

637
00:54:11,255 --> 00:54:13,875
- Who are you?
- Everything else I told you is true.

638
00:54:13,877 --> 00:54:16,821
- When did you meet Jess?
- I've never met her.

639
00:54:16,823 --> 00:54:20,405
- Yes, you did.
- Why do you keep saying that? It was just a line in a bar.

640
00:54:20,407 --> 00:54:21,812
- Give me your phone.
- Why?

641
00:54:21,814 --> 00:54:23,667
- Why not?
- Because it's my phone.

642
00:54:23,669 --> 00:54:25,491
You're hiding something?

643
00:54:25,493 --> 00:54:28,115
You're getting just a little too
agitated. It's making me uncomfortable.

644
00:54:28,117 --> 00:54:30,900
I'm lost in the woods with a
strange man who's been lying to me,

645
00:54:30,902 --> 00:54:33,300
and I do not give a shit if it
makes you feel uncomfortable.

646
00:54:33,302 --> 00:54:35,764
- Now, give me your phone!
- All right, calm down.

647
00:54:35,766 --> 00:54:37,779
I'll give you the phone.

648
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:42,066
- Don't mess with it first.
- I'm unlocking it!

649
00:54:52,182 --> 00:54:55,125
- What are you doing?
- I'm deleting all the recordings.

650
00:54:55,127 --> 00:54:58,197
If you even <i>are</i> a journalist,
then permission is revoked.

651
00:54:58,199 --> 00:55:00,307
You cannot use my story.

652
00:55:00,309 --> 00:55:02,514
How do you...

653
00:55:04,214 --> 00:55:07,154
How do you what?

654
00:55:08,566 --> 00:55:10,866
Oh, my God.

655
00:55:11,287 --> 00:55:12,723
What?

656
00:55:12,725 --> 00:55:15,635
You met me on purpose, didn't you?

657
00:55:16,662 --> 00:55:19,189
I don't know what you think...

658
00:55:19,191 --> 00:55:20,948
or what you're talking about.

659
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:22,805
- What did you do to her?
- Who, Jess?

660
00:55:22,807 --> 00:55:25,619
- Yeah.
- I've never met her.

661
00:55:25,621 --> 00:55:27,604
There are photos right here on this phone.

662
00:55:27,606 --> 00:55:29,492
- Give me the phone.
- Stay back.

663
00:55:29,494 --> 00:55:30,868
- Give me the damn phone!
- No!

664
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:33,170
Give me it!

665
00:55:43,479 --> 00:55:45,618
(phone hits ground)

666
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:50,579
Sara!

667
00:55:53,110 --> 00:55:55,891
Hey, you're gonna get lost!

668
00:55:55,893 --> 00:55:58,354
Come back!

669
00:55:58,870 --> 00:56:01,108
Sara!

670
00:56:11,223 --> 00:56:13,427
No.

671
00:56:43,894 --> 00:56:46,228
Sara!

672
00:57:47,766 --> 00:57:49,747
Aiden?

673
00:57:51,701 --> 00:57:53,682
Sara!

674
00:58:05,141 --> 00:58:07,220
FEMALE VOICE: <i>Turn around, Sara.</i>

675
00:58:07,222 --> 00:58:09,011
No. (sniffles)

676
00:58:09,013 --> 00:58:10,452
No.

677
00:58:10,454 --> 00:58:12,595
<i>Turn around, Sara.</i>

678
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:17,651
<i>Turn around, Sara.</i>

679
00:58:20,661 --> 00:58:22,995
<i>Turn around, Sara.</i>

680
00:58:23,862 --> 00:58:25,491
- (sobs)
- <i>Turn around, Sara.</i>

681
00:58:25,493 --> 00:58:27,858
You're not real!

682
00:58:31,191 --> 00:58:33,747
<i>Turn around, Sara.</i>

683
00:58:44,309 --> 00:58:46,259
<i>Turn around, Sara.</i>

684
00:58:55,799 --> 00:58:57,555
(gasps)

685
00:59:02,103 --> 00:59:04,242
(speaking Japanese)

686
00:59:11,766 --> 00:59:14,708
- Michi?
- Rob. Hey.

687
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:17,714
We'll find her. Don't worry.

688
00:59:31,094 --> 00:59:33,332
(groaning)

689
00:59:33,334 --> 00:59:36,117
(gasping)

690
00:59:36,119 --> 00:59:39,827
(coughing)

691
00:59:41,589 --> 00:59:43,541
(groans)

692
00:59:43,543 --> 00:59:47,058
(screaming)

693
01:01:13,301 --> 01:01:17,075
(howling)

694
01:01:21,078 --> 01:01:22,996
(loud shriek)

695
01:01:22,998 --> 01:01:25,555
(clattering)

696
01:01:44,406 --> 01:01:48,979
GIRL'S VOICE (singsongy): <i>Sara.</i>

697
01:02:01,589 --> 01:02:06,130
GIRL'S VOICE (singsongy): <i>Sara.</i>

698
01:02:08,151 --> 01:02:10,131
Sara.

699
01:02:10,357 --> 01:02:12,723
It's me, Hoshiko.

700
01:02:12,725 --> 01:02:14,643
- What are you doing down here?
- Come.

701
01:02:14,645 --> 01:02:16,563
- Come where?
- You come.

702
01:02:16,565 --> 01:02:18,420
Miss Jess want to see you.

703
01:02:18,422 --> 01:02:20,404
Jess?

704
01:02:20,406 --> 01:02:23,571
- I take you.
- Down here?

705
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:27,410
- (screeching in distance)
- What's making that noise?

706
01:02:29,429 --> 01:02:32,914
- Animal.
- That doesn't sound like an animal.

707
01:02:34,357 --> 01:02:37,362
Why is Jess down here?

708
01:02:41,526 --> 01:02:43,731
Tell me!

709
01:03:15,189 --> 01:03:17,779
(shrieks)

710
01:03:26,165 --> 01:03:28,466
Help!

711
01:03:28,853 --> 01:03:30,739
Can you hear me?

712
01:03:30,741 --> 01:03:32,914
Help!

713
01:03:33,781 --> 01:03:36,082
Help!

714
01:03:42,262 --> 01:03:44,532
- AIDEN: Sara?
- Aiden?

715
01:03:44,534 --> 01:03:46,707
- Sara.
- Aiden!

716
01:03:46,709 --> 01:03:48,691
- You gotta get me out of here.
- Hold on.

717
01:03:48,693 --> 01:03:50,547
I'm gonna find something
to throw down for you.

718
01:03:50,549 --> 01:03:53,298
Aiden, don't leave me, please! No!

719
01:04:06,230 --> 01:04:07,923
No.

720
01:04:07,925 --> 01:04:09,905
No.

721
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:15,251
If you see something bad, it's
not real. It's just in your head.

722
01:04:15,253 --> 01:04:19,475
If you see something bad, it's
not real. It's in your head.

723
01:04:19,477 --> 01:04:23,026
If you see something bad, it's
not real. It's in your head.

724
01:04:23,349 --> 01:04:25,298
It's in your head.

725
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:28,019
It's in your head.

726
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:32,531
It's in your head.

727
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:37,841
(insect buzzing)

728
01:05:14,198 --> 01:05:16,179
(gasps)

729
01:05:41,525 --> 01:05:43,507
No.

730
01:05:43,894 --> 01:05:45,875
(screams)

731
01:05:46,293 --> 01:05:48,818
No! (screaming)

732
01:05:52,726 --> 01:05:56,083
- AIDEN: Sara!
- Aiden.

733
01:05:56,437 --> 01:05:58,385
Sara, hang on.

734
01:05:59,765 --> 01:06:02,929
(sobbing) Aiden, get me out of here.

735
01:06:03,734 --> 01:06:05,908
Okay. All right, grab that.

736
01:06:05,910 --> 01:06:07,924
I gotcha.

737
01:06:07,926 --> 01:06:09,332
Okay.

738
01:06:09,334 --> 01:06:11,315
- Pull.
- (grunts)

739
01:06:33,141 --> 01:06:34,866
Hey.

740
01:06:35,382 --> 01:06:37,587
Sara, you okay?

741
01:06:41,462 --> 01:06:43,092
Michi was right.

742
01:06:43,094 --> 01:06:45,971
The forest <i>does</i> make you see things.

743
01:06:51,093 --> 01:06:53,107
Look.

744
01:06:53,109 --> 01:06:55,059
I found a place.

745
01:06:55,061 --> 01:06:58,196
It might have a radio. It's a
ranger station. It's not that far.

746
01:06:58,198 --> 01:07:01,490
You just stumbled across it right now?

747
01:07:07,349 --> 01:07:09,906
(backpack unzips)

748
01:07:10,933 --> 01:07:12,851
Here.

749
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:16,209
Take the knife.

750
01:07:16,469 --> 01:07:18,963
Why am I taking the knife?

751
01:07:18,965 --> 01:07:21,491
So you trust me more.

752
01:07:25,142 --> 01:07:27,251
We're in this together, right?

753
01:07:29,718 --> 01:07:31,730
Right.

754
01:07:32,373 --> 01:07:35,441
Just let me wash off first.

755
01:08:28,405 --> 01:08:30,547
AIDEN: Sara.

756
01:08:33,205 --> 01:08:35,155
- You all right?
- (gasps)

757
01:08:35,157 --> 01:08:37,393
I'm fine!

758
01:08:54,102 --> 01:08:58,770
Well, if there's no radio, at
least we got a place to sleep.

759
01:09:09,301 --> 01:09:11,313
Hello?

760
01:09:26,294 --> 01:09:29,107
Come on, baby. Come on. Work.

761
01:09:31,637 --> 01:09:34,289
(clicking)

762
01:09:48,822 --> 01:09:50,964
Hey, Sara, give me the knife.

763
01:09:50,966 --> 01:09:53,075
What?

764
01:09:53,622 --> 01:09:55,987
The knife... let me have it.

765
01:09:55,989 --> 01:09:59,058
- Why?
- So I can open this thing up.

766
01:10:00,341 --> 01:10:04,178
Or I can smash it on the damn
table! Just give me the knife!

767
01:10:22,709 --> 01:10:25,873
(rattling)

768
01:10:46,901 --> 01:10:49,937
(clicking)

769
01:10:51,253 --> 01:10:53,907
Why do you think they locked the basement?

770
01:10:53,909 --> 01:10:55,539
What makes you think it's a basement?

771
01:10:55,541 --> 01:10:57,426
What else would it be?

772
01:10:57,428 --> 01:10:59,921
I don't know. A closet?

773
01:11:11,797 --> 01:11:15,185
- JESS: Sara?
- Jess?

774
01:11:19,573 --> 01:11:22,451
- Jess?
- Shh.

775
01:11:39,990 --> 01:11:41,970
Oh!

776
01:12:12,820 --> 01:12:14,801
Okay.

777
01:12:15,509 --> 01:12:17,553
- Okay.
- God, please be real.

778
01:12:26,357 --> 01:12:30,068
AIDEN: Hey, do you wanna chow down
before it gets too dark to see?

779
01:12:30,070 --> 01:12:32,082
Huh?

780
01:12:36,693 --> 01:12:38,801
Sara, what are you doing?

781
01:12:51,285 --> 01:12:54,034
Here, it's the last one. You can have it.

782
01:12:56,885 --> 01:12:58,962
Come on. Take it.

783
01:13:10,198 --> 01:13:13,203
I don't know if the
forest made you a psycho

784
01:13:13,205 --> 01:13:15,411
or if you were crazy anyways.

785
01:13:15,413 --> 01:13:18,611
But if you don't let my
sister out of that basement,

786
01:13:18,613 --> 01:13:20,977
I will kill you.

787
01:13:21,302 --> 01:13:23,474
Sara.

788
01:13:24,148 --> 01:13:26,321
Wake up.

789
01:13:26,614 --> 01:13:28,915
Your sister is dead.

790
01:13:28,917 --> 01:13:31,539
- She's been in here for five days.
- Give me the key.

791
01:13:31,541 --> 01:13:34,547
Okay. All right. All right.

792
01:13:34,549 --> 01:13:37,107
I'll let her out, okay?
Just let me get the key.

793
01:13:37,109 --> 01:13:39,858
- Where is it?
- It's in my boot.

794
01:13:40,405 --> 01:13:42,641
Let me get it.

795
01:13:43,445 --> 01:13:45,747
Yeah.

796
01:13:58,677 --> 01:14:00,851
(groans)

797
01:14:03,252 --> 01:14:05,234
(gasps)

798
01:14:08,437 --> 01:14:11,410
(coughing)

799
01:14:20,981 --> 01:14:25,489
(gasping, coughing)

800
01:14:33,076 --> 01:14:34,802
(door opens)

801
01:14:34,804 --> 01:14:37,393
- (hinge creaking)
- Jess?

802
01:14:38,837 --> 01:14:41,234
She...

803
01:14:41,652 --> 01:14:43,729
She's not here.

804
01:14:56,309 --> 01:14:58,865
(gasping)

805
01:15:10,324 --> 01:15:11,953
Jess.

806
01:16:00,532 --> 01:16:02,705
Jess?

807
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:05,555
Jess, no. Stop. Don't look. Don't look.

808
01:16:05,557 --> 01:16:07,474
Don't look.

809
01:16:07,476 --> 01:16:10,129
Don't look. (gasps)

810
01:16:12,182 --> 01:16:13,779
Oh, God.

811
01:16:13,781 --> 01:16:15,828
Daddy, why?

812
01:16:15,830 --> 01:16:19,026
- Oh, Daddy.
- (gasps)

813
01:16:19,028 --> 01:16:20,690
Oh, God.

814
01:16:24,662 --> 01:16:26,386
Go!

815
01:16:26,708 --> 01:16:28,977
Go, go, go.

816
01:16:29,525 --> 01:16:31,890
Daddy. Daddy, no. Let me go!

817
01:16:35,092 --> 01:16:39,537
Let me... go!

818
01:16:50,260 --> 01:16:55,599
(screaming)

819
01:17:16,405 --> 01:17:21,490
(officer speaking Japanese)

820
01:17:23,412 --> 01:17:25,521
MICHI: We should go.

821
01:17:30,869 --> 01:17:33,138
(speaks Japanese)

822
01:17:55,476 --> 01:17:58,354
(screaming)

823
01:18:21,429 --> 01:18:22,866
JESS: Oh, God, help!

824
01:18:22,868 --> 01:18:24,595
- Jess?
- Please, somebody help! Help me!

825
01:18:24,597 --> 01:18:26,770
Oh, God, Jess.

826
01:18:29,621 --> 01:18:31,954
Jess!

827
01:18:34,004 --> 01:18:35,985
Jess!

828
01:18:44,948 --> 01:18:46,897
Jess!

829
01:18:52,662 --> 01:18:55,506
Jess!

830
01:19:00,884 --> 01:19:02,516
Jess!

831
01:19:02,518 --> 01:19:04,369
Wait!

832
01:19:08,949 --> 01:19:12,531
(speaking Japanese)

833
01:19:12,533 --> 01:19:14,290
(whimpering)

834
01:19:14,292 --> 01:19:17,330
- Oh, God, help me.
- Sara?

835
01:19:17,332 --> 01:19:20,529
Sara. Hey. Hey.

836
01:19:21,749 --> 01:19:24,528
(whimpering) Don't touch me!

837
01:19:24,789 --> 01:19:26,642
Jess. Jess.

838
01:19:26,644 --> 01:19:28,786
It's me. It's Rob.

839
01:19:29,781 --> 01:19:31,634
Rob?

840
01:19:31,636 --> 01:19:33,779
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

841
01:19:33,781 --> 01:19:35,570
Oh, God!

842
01:19:37,396 --> 01:19:40,818
I've been lost for days.
I didn't think I'd make it.

843
01:19:43,541 --> 01:19:46,770
- Hey, hey. Have you seen Sara?
- What?

844
01:19:46,772 --> 01:19:50,481
- Have you seen Sara?
- She's not with you?

845
01:19:51,989 --> 01:19:54,162
No.

846
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:11,636
No.

847
01:20:11,638 --> 01:20:14,418
Please, let me go.

848
01:20:15,765 --> 01:20:17,746
Let me go!

849
01:20:37,204 --> 01:20:39,506
No! No!

850
01:20:39,956 --> 01:20:41,746
No! No!

851
01:20:42,965 --> 01:20:46,930
No! (screaming)

852
01:20:57,236 --> 01:20:59,026
She came for me.

853
01:20:59,028 --> 01:21:00,722
She came for me.

854
01:21:00,724 --> 01:21:03,249
She knew you were still alive.

855
01:21:05,909 --> 01:21:07,666
We go back in first thing, all right?

856
01:21:07,668 --> 01:21:09,747
- We have to go back right now.
- ROB: No, no, no.

857
01:21:09,749 --> 01:21:12,465
- Right now.
- Jess. Hey.

858
01:21:13,397 --> 01:21:15,409
What?

859
01:21:18,133 --> 01:21:20,114
Nothing.

860
01:21:21,781 --> 01:21:23,762
That's the...

861
01:21:25,941 --> 01:21:27,763
It's silent.

862
01:21:27,765 --> 01:21:30,385
Okay.

863
01:21:32,757 --> 01:21:35,313
Oh, Sara.

864
01:21:40,597 --> 01:21:43,506
