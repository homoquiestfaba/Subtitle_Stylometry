1
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,385
Geez...

2
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,505
Take it easy, man.

3
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,945
We're not in the
jungle anymore.

4
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,820
Just gonna trade one jungle
for another, Simon.

5
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,905
Well, this place has
a little hot lady

6
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,940
That actually thinks
you're a pretty big deal.

7
00:00:59,975 --> 00:01:01,385
Where'd she get that idea?

8
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,340
Well, hell, man, I told her
last time we were here.

9
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,465
Thank you.

10
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,745
What are you doing?

11
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:30,620
What do you mean,
what am I doing?

12
00:01:30,655 --> 00:01:31,425
I'm coming.

13
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,585
You're not invited,

14
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,860
Especially in that
pink thing.

15
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,260
Hey, man, this is
rustic salmon.

16
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:36,420
My mama gave me this.

17
00:01:36,455 --> 00:01:37,865
I told you,

18
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,385
You're going to
mess me up.

19
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,560
Look, what you need
is a witness.

20
00:01:41,595 --> 00:01:43,700
What I need is
to do this by myself.

21
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,700
I'm coming, man.

22
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,860
<i>In Ulu Tiram today,
our reporter, Matt Ellman,</i>

23
00:01:54,895 --> 00:01:56,185
<i>And his cameraman,
Simon Porter,</i>

24
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,620
<i>Had a close call
while filing a report</i>

25
00:01:58,655 --> 00:02:00,305
<i>From a rebel encampment.</i>

26
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,185
<i>After a few tense moments,</i>

27
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,620
<i>The rebel leader
agreed to talk.</i>

28
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,980
Oh, he is so cute!

29
00:02:07,015 --> 00:02:08,397
Lucky girl...

30
00:02:08,432 --> 00:02:09,745
Dan! Dan!

31
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,865
Come on over here!

32
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,220
Look, it's
Jessie's man.

33
00:02:14,255 --> 00:02:15,505
He's not my man,
Deborah.

34
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,580
Honestly,
we've known each other

35
00:02:16,615 --> 00:02:17,860
For barely two months.

36
00:02:17,895 --> 00:02:18,905
Two months?

37
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,740
Oh, you can get into
a lot of trouble

38
00:02:20,775 --> 00:02:22,740
In two months,
can't we, Hal?

39
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,020
It's on the house,
Antonio.

40
00:02:26,055 --> 00:02:27,065
Thanks.

41
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,220
Here's a toast
from tony and I.

42
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,540
To Jessie Machalan,

43
00:02:29,575 --> 00:02:30,785
The best tour guide

44
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,900
In all of
southeast Asia.

45
00:02:31,935 --> 00:02:32,905
Well, thank you.

46
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,580
Asia? Hell,
the world!

47
00:02:34,615 --> 00:02:36,185
May she find
true love

48
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,380
Before I turn straight
and marry her myself.

49
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,620
<i>Despite efforts
at brokering a peace,</i>

50
00:02:41,655 --> 00:02:42,665
<i>The killing goes on.</i>

51
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,465
Three long years in the jungle,

52
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,780
<i>And these men show no signs
of backing down...</i>

53
00:02:46,815 --> 00:02:48,185
Hey, wait up!

54
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,460
<i>Matt Ellman, reporting
to you from Ulu Tiram.</i>

55
00:02:49,495 --> 00:02:50,665
He's lying.

56
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,380
I don't think
Matt's capable of that.

57
00:02:52,415 --> 00:02:53,385
He's lying!

58
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,025
He's not
in ulu tiram.

59
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,460
And what makes you
say that?

60
00:02:56,495 --> 00:02:58,180
Because
I'm right here.

61
00:02:58,215 --> 00:03:00,905
Baby!

62
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,780
This is Matt,
everybody.

63
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:03,665
Hi!

64
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,705
Hi, Matt.

65
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,660
Hi, everybody.

66
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,620
God, you smell good.

67
00:03:15,655 --> 00:03:16,745
I missed you.

68
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,345
I missed you, too.

69
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,300
I hate it when you go off
on assignment like that

70
00:03:20,335 --> 00:03:21,937
And disappear.

71
00:03:21,972 --> 00:03:23,505
It's what I do,

72
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,060
But if anybody
could talk me out of it,

73
00:03:25,095 --> 00:03:26,220
It would be you.

74
00:03:26,255 --> 00:03:27,945
Excuse me,

75
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,160
Your champagne.

76
00:03:30,195 --> 00:03:32,340
Congratulations!

77
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,225
Hey, thanks,

78
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,180
But what's
the occasion?

79
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,260
You know, I'll let,
Matt take care of that.

80
00:03:45,295 --> 00:03:46,757
No, stay,
have a few beer.

81
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:48,185
You know,
I'd love to,

82
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,865
But, I got to call my mom.

83
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,440
Yeah, you see,
when I win this lottery,

84
00:03:51,475 --> 00:03:52,980
I'm gonna buy her
a brand-new house.

85
00:03:53,015 --> 00:03:54,357
You're a good man.

86
00:03:54,392 --> 00:03:55,665
Really, Jessie?

87
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,540
Because I find that people find
me...

88
00:03:57,575 --> 00:03:58,705
Good night,
buddy.

89
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,745
Yeah, good night, and...

90
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,940
Make sure my boy
has a good night.

91
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,300
Sir, jewelllery,
jewellery...

92
00:04:08,335 --> 00:04:09,580
Oh, yeah!

93
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,080
Come on, sir.

94
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,305
Wait here.

95
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,540
You're not going to run off
to the mountains again, are you?

96
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,700
Not in this lifetime.

97
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:39,740
Excuse me...

98
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:12,840
Jessie...

99
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:16,987
Jess...

100
00:06:17,022 --> 00:06:21,100
Jessie?

101
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,960
Jess?

102
00:06:29,995 --> 00:06:31,500
Jess...

103
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,540
Matthew Ellman,

104
00:08:46,575 --> 00:08:48,420
We have found you.

105
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,300
Jessie...

106
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,140
Jess?

107
00:10:05,175 --> 00:10:07,460
Jessie!

108
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,985
What the hell is this place?

109
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,580
Please, please,
please, please...

110
00:10:24,352 --> 00:10:25,985
Please, please...

111
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,540
Jessie,
is that you?

112
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,785
Matthew?

113
00:10:38,435 --> 00:10:40,945
Oh, thank God!

114
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,900
I thought
I was completely alone.

115
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,740
I'm sorry, but...
Do I know you?

116
00:10:47,775 --> 00:10:50,237
It's me.

117
00:10:50,272 --> 00:10:52,665
Deborah.

118
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,460
Deborah glass,
from Jessie's tour.

119
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,000
Deborah?

120
00:10:57,035 --> 00:10:58,345
Yeah.

121
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,300
But you're...

122
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,340
Dead?

123
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,425
Come.

124
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,380
Over here.

125
00:11:15,315 --> 00:11:17,025
Oh, my God...

126
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,020
Is that a face you remember?

127
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,540
Not for a very long time.

128
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,705
Matt...

129
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,620
What happened to us?

130
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,505
There was a bomb.

131
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,900
This girl
in the club,

132
00:11:37,935 --> 00:11:39,705
She just...

133
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,020
She blew
herself up.

134
00:11:41,055 --> 00:11:43,660
Oh, God, no...

135
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,420
Daniel?

136
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,380
Oh, Daniel!

137
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,540
Daniel!

138
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,900
Daniel,
is that you?

139
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,080
Daniel!

140
00:12:38,115 --> 00:12:39,187
Sweetie!

141
00:12:39,222 --> 00:12:40,225
Daniel!

142
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,385
Honey!
Oh, my God!

143
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,860
Oh, my God, I thought
I'd lost you.

144
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:49,900
I thought
you were gone.

145
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,020
Oh, no...

146
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,105
Look at you.

147
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,580
You're the girl
I married.

148
00:12:55,712 --> 00:12:57,705
Deborah?

149
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,820
Is that Deborah?

150
00:13:00,855 --> 00:13:03,865
Hal, is that you?

151
00:13:05,175 --> 00:13:06,700
- Daniel?
- Hal?

152
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,945
What's going on?

153
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,625
Hey, where's
Antonio?

154
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,780
Shouldn't tony
be here, too?

155
00:13:13,815 --> 00:13:14,785
Matt!

156
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,100
Wait a minute,
why haven't...

157
00:13:16,135 --> 00:13:18,020
Why haven't
you changed?

158
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,220
What the hell
is going on?

159
00:13:19,255 --> 00:13:21,457
Where's Jessie?

160
00:13:21,492 --> 00:13:23,625
I don't know,

161
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,740
But right now,
the thing we have to do is

162
00:13:24,775 --> 00:13:26,897
Act like this is real,

163
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:28,985
This is happening.

164
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,000
Antonio and Jessie
must be here somewhere.

165
00:13:31,035 --> 00:13:32,980
Let's stay together,
see if we can find them.

166
00:13:33,015 --> 00:13:35,357
Yeah, but you don't
have to do this.

167
00:13:35,392 --> 00:13:37,700
You know,
we're not your problem.

168
00:13:37,735 --> 00:13:38,985
We all know Jessie.

169
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,345
She's cute,
but stubborn.

170
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,900
If you're missing,
she'll try and find you.

171
00:13:42,935 --> 00:13:44,780
Why don't you guys
stay here,

172
00:13:44,815 --> 00:13:46,180
Make a fire,
get warm.

173
00:13:46,215 --> 00:13:47,385
Okay.

174
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,100
I'll see if I can find
something to eat.

175
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,660
Hey, Bernie...

176
00:13:57,695 --> 00:13:59,380
Hey, Bernie!

177
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,060
You know that guy?

178
00:14:03,095 --> 00:14:04,905
I'm not sure.

179
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,660
He looked like
one of the junior partners

180
00:14:06,695 --> 00:14:08,837
From our new york office.

181
00:14:08,872 --> 00:14:10,980
Worked on the 82nd floor,

182
00:14:11,015 --> 00:14:11,980
North tower.

183
00:14:18,395 --> 00:14:20,300
Hey, Matt, wait up!

184
00:14:20,335 --> 00:14:22,497
It's just me.

185
00:14:22,532 --> 00:14:24,556
No bracelet?

186
00:14:24,591 --> 00:14:26,545
I had one.

187
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,620
I remember waking up.

188
00:14:28,655 --> 00:14:30,625
I was floating
in water.

189
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,380
This woman in robes
flew over me

190
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,360
And cut the bracelet
from my wrist.

191
00:14:35,395 --> 00:14:38,027
Man, how friggin'
nuts is that?

192
00:14:40,695 --> 00:14:42,465
I saw all of us...

193
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,540
Just before I blacked out.

194
00:14:45,575 --> 00:14:47,460
You were all dead.

195
00:14:47,495 --> 00:14:49,457
Antonio?

196
00:14:49,492 --> 00:14:51,385
I'm sorry.

197
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,825
No, no, that's
a good thing.

198
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,020
That means tony
has to be here, too,

199
00:14:57,055 --> 00:14:58,385
And Jessie.

200
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,500
And I detest

201
00:14:59,535 --> 00:15:00,585
All of my sins, lord.

202
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:04,220
And I detest all of
my sins, lord...

203
00:15:04,255 --> 00:15:06,465
What is this?

204
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,620
Some kind of
scanner?

205
00:15:11,935 --> 00:15:14,260
One way to find out.

206
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,460
Hey, Matt,

207
00:15:18,495 --> 00:15:20,140
Let me try it.

208
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,465
Meatloaf?

209
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,220
Okay, they got me there.

210
00:15:39,255 --> 00:15:40,425
That's weird.

211
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,260
I was just thinking
about how hungry I was.

212
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,620
Mm, that's
mom's meatloaf.

213
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,185
Excuse me, please?

214
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,700
May I share
your fire?

215
00:16:04,735 --> 00:16:07,197
Oh, yes.
Yeah, of course.

216
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:09,426
I have gathered
some seaweed.

217
00:16:09,461 --> 00:16:11,620
It may provide
some nourishment.

218
00:16:11,655 --> 00:16:13,137
Anything'll do.

219
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,620
We're starved.

220
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,820
Can you tell me,

221
00:16:24,855 --> 00:16:26,140
Am I dead?

222
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,740
That seems to be
the question of the day.

223
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:34,677
But that is not
an answer.

224
00:16:34,712 --> 00:16:37,580
Only because I don't have one.

225
00:16:37,615 --> 00:16:39,745
Finally,

226
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,020
An honest man.

227
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,520
Your clothes,

228
00:16:44,555 --> 00:16:46,945
Your robe...

229
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,520
You're a Bhikkhuni,

230
00:16:48,555 --> 00:16:50,025
A buddhist nun.

231
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,145
Where do you come from?

232
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,340
I am from nippon, near kyoto.

233
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,465
I was born in the fourth year

234
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,740
Of the reign
of emperor go-reizei.

235
00:16:57,775 --> 00:16:59,980
You lived
during the gempei wars?

236
00:17:00,015 --> 00:17:02,620
That was
800 years ago.

237
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:05,540
I'm sorry, I was...

238
00:17:05,575 --> 00:17:07,220
Am a history professor.

239
00:17:07,255 --> 00:17:09,025
This is amazing.

240
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,180
You're from
medieval japan,

241
00:17:11,215 --> 00:17:13,265
But you speak english?

242
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,620
I have not
heard of this...

243
00:17:14,655 --> 00:17:16,557
English...

244
00:17:16,592 --> 00:17:18,425
Before today.

245
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:21,460
It is like I learned it
in a dream.

246
00:17:21,495 --> 00:17:22,785
That makes
as much sense

247
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,305
As anything does
in this place.

248
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,780
English is the most
widespread language

249
00:17:26,815 --> 00:17:28,185
In history.

250
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,660
If I wanted everybody
to understand each other,

251
00:17:30,695 --> 00:17:33,100
I'd rewire their brains
to install english.

252
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,265
But you didn't,

253
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,060
Which begs the question...

254
00:17:37,095 --> 00:17:38,180
Who did?

255
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,100
Are you okay?

256
00:18:17,135 --> 00:18:18,620
Jessica!

257
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,920
Jessie!

258
00:18:19,955 --> 00:18:21,180
Jessica...

259
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,145
I know you.

260
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,780
You were there,
in the river.

261
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:36,940
No, you're mistaken.

262
00:18:36,975 --> 00:18:38,425
No.

263
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,660
Remembering faces is my job.

264
00:18:39,695 --> 00:18:40,860
You were there, my friend.

265
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,665
I said you were mistaken,

266
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,020
And you've hardly earned
the right to call me "friend."

267
00:18:46,055 --> 00:18:47,980
Just now,
you called a woman's name.

268
00:18:48,015 --> 00:18:49,340
Who were you looking for?

269
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,037
Was it Jessie?

270
00:18:51,072 --> 00:18:52,700
Jessie Machalan?

271
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,540
How do you know
Jessie?

272
00:18:56,575 --> 00:18:57,677
My arm, sir.

273
00:18:57,712 --> 00:18:58,745
Jessie Machalan.

274
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,220
Tell me
how you know her!

275
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,860
My advice, sir, as a gentleman,

276
00:19:12,895 --> 00:19:14,597
Is forget Jessie Machalan.

277
00:19:14,632 --> 00:19:16,300
Forget you ever met her.

278
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,925
Fast, fast!

279
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,160
They will be here!

280
00:19:40,195 --> 00:19:41,317
Who? Hey! Who?

281
00:19:41,352 --> 00:19:42,440
Who will be here?

282
00:19:42,475 --> 00:19:43,565
My money.

283
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,640
I thought you said
this was going to be safe.

284
00:19:44,675 --> 00:19:46,005
My money...

285
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,280
No. No money
until you show us.

286
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,645
Let's set up.

287
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,360
I can't shoot this, man.

288
00:20:19,395 --> 00:20:22,560
My money...

289
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,040
Let's set up.

290
00:20:35,115 --> 00:20:36,085
What...

291
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,765
What are you
doing?

292
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,400
I'm sorry, Matthew Ellman.

293
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,005
You saw?

294
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,640
Who the hell are you?

295
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,580
I was watching you.

296
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,680
The man who beat you,
do not judge him.

297
00:20:56,715 --> 00:20:58,677
Maybe you didn't hear me.

298
00:20:58,712 --> 00:21:00,576
I said who the hell are you?

299
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:02,405
His name is
Richard Burton.

300
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,640
Those in power will try
to use you against him.

301
00:21:05,675 --> 00:21:06,600
Do not listen to them.

302
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,725
Okay, you know what?

303
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,040
I'm just going to go
find some cold water

304
00:21:14,075 --> 00:21:15,325
And dip my head in it,

305
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,840
And start this day
all over,

306
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,077
All right, Obi-Wan?

307
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,840
You're that thing
I saw in the cave,

308
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:40,040
When I was wearing
the wrist band,

309
00:21:40,075 --> 00:21:42,837
When I was basically dead.

310
00:21:42,872 --> 00:21:45,600
I'm your caretaker, Matthew.

311
00:21:45,635 --> 00:21:47,800
I am here to watch you.

312
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,520
He said he was watching me.

313
00:21:51,555 --> 00:21:53,325
Listen to me.

314
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,805
He is a salvationist,
a traitor.

315
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,720
They have corrupted many
here in Riverworld,

316
00:21:57,755 --> 00:21:59,805
Including this man, Burton.

317
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,760
I'm sorry, but you guys
can fight your own war.

318
00:22:03,795 --> 00:22:05,257
I've got someone I need to find.

319
00:22:05,292 --> 00:22:06,720
If you wish to find Jessica...

320
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,200
Then you must first
stop Burton,

321
00:22:11,235 --> 00:22:13,760
Even if it means killing him.

322
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,765
No...

323
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,120
You can't do that!

324
00:22:24,155 --> 00:22:25,205
You are hurt.

325
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,240
Did you see
that thing?

326
00:22:27,275 --> 00:22:28,405
I saw nothing.

327
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,100
I heard you talking.

328
00:22:30,135 --> 00:22:31,725
I was looking for you.

329
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,960
I'm not even sure
it was human.

330
00:22:33,995 --> 00:22:36,280
You saw an oni?

331
00:22:36,315 --> 00:22:38,805
A demon?

332
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,120
Oni, alien,
bart simpson,

333
00:22:41,155 --> 00:22:43,437
I have no idea.

334
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,400
I've got to get some
answers from someone.

335
00:22:47,435 --> 00:22:49,205
You need to rest.

336
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,000
You are fortunate
to be alive.

337
00:22:52,035 --> 00:22:55,240
Yeah, if we are alive.

338
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,740
Does your head hurt?

339
00:22:58,775 --> 00:23:00,645
It's killing me.

340
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,040
If you can feel pain,
then you're alive,

341
00:23:04,075 --> 00:23:05,805
And if you're alive,

342
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,200
Then perhaps
we all are.

343
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,920
Oh, feels good!

344
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,440
We lost one of
our own tonight.

345
00:23:48,475 --> 00:23:50,485
We must be cautious.

346
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:54,440
There are second chances
everywhere.

347
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,840
You were unwise to provoke
Mr. Ellman so soon.

348
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:00,725
Why?

349
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,285
He has been chosen.

350
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,460
He's not wearing a band.

351
00:24:03,495 --> 00:24:04,565
He's looking for the girl.

352
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,960
Everything puts him
in opposition to me.

353
00:24:05,995 --> 00:24:07,117
I say get rid of him,

354
00:24:07,152 --> 00:24:08,205
Sooner rather than later.

355
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,600
Not while
he's being observed...

356
00:24:10,635 --> 00:24:12,805
And protected,

357
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,680
And he's not yet had time
to make a judgement.

358
00:24:15,715 --> 00:24:17,960
Perhaps he will
come around to your way.

359
00:24:17,995 --> 00:24:22,085
Not with the girl between us.

360
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,160
Then let him lead you
back to her,

361
00:24:24,195 --> 00:24:25,520
And perhaps the tower.

362
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,680
And when you have it
within your sights,

363
00:24:29,715 --> 00:24:32,360
Do what you must.

364
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,920
How many times?

365
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,080
How many times have you ridden
the suicide express, huh?

366
00:24:47,115 --> 00:24:48,217
Me?

367
00:24:48,252 --> 00:24:49,285
Four!

368
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,980
Four times I've killed myself.

369
00:24:51,015 --> 00:24:52,867
That, comrades, is courage.

370
00:24:52,902 --> 00:24:54,720
That, comrades, is stupidity.

371
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,600
Because one time
you won't come back,

372
00:24:58,635 --> 00:25:01,000
And no one knows
when that time may be.

373
00:25:01,035 --> 00:25:02,245
Never do anything

374
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,120
For which the outcome
is uncertain.

375
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,045
Now, wait for me here.

376
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,440
Tomorrow,
we meet our friend,

377
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,560
And, God-willing,
we'll begin our journey.

378
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,920
So, what was his name?

379
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,485
A woman like you

380
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,000
Doesn't just suddenly
decide to become a nun.

381
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,100
Yoshinaka,

382
00:25:56,135 --> 00:25:58,645
A samurai.

383
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,725
He was a great man,

384
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,400
But also an ambitious man,

385
00:26:04,435 --> 00:26:07,040
And to achieve
his ambitions,

386
00:26:07,075 --> 00:26:10,177
He waged a war.

387
00:26:10,212 --> 00:26:13,280
Many people died.

388
00:26:13,315 --> 00:26:15,520
He died.

389
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,520
He was my greatest mistake.

390
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,600
What was yours?

391
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,840
There was more than just one.

392
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,525
"the road we walk

393
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:38,840
Was built with the stones
that scar our feet."

394
00:26:38,875 --> 00:26:41,120
Who said that?

395
00:26:41,155 --> 00:26:42,085
Buddha?

396
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:46,725
A nun from near kyoto,

397
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:51,120
In the years
after the gempei wars.

398
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:57,165
I was a...

399
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,220
A television
reporter

400
00:26:59,255 --> 00:27:01,240
During our
times of war.

401
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,460
I had a buddy,

402
00:27:05,495 --> 00:27:07,045
A cameraman.

403
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,640
We used a machine
to take pictures of places,

404
00:27:10,675 --> 00:27:13,897
People who had been
hurt by others.

405
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:17,085
I'm not explaining
myself very well.

406
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,400
You painted portraits
and told true stories.

407
00:27:21,435 --> 00:27:26,205
Yeah, most of the time,

408
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,360
And you got it right,
you were a hero.

409
00:27:29,395 --> 00:27:30,485
Wrong...

410
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,740
To live an honorable life,

411
00:27:33,775 --> 00:27:36,960
One must risk everything,

412
00:27:36,995 --> 00:27:38,400
Always.

413
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,325
Tomoe...

414
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,485
This samurai of yours,

415
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,600
If he had to kill a man,
a stranger, to save you,

416
00:27:49,635 --> 00:27:51,757
Would he have done it?

417
00:27:51,792 --> 00:27:53,880
Without hesitation.

418
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,320
I need to find this man, Burton,

419
00:27:59,355 --> 00:28:01,280
The one who attacked me.

420
00:28:01,315 --> 00:28:03,920
To kill him.

421
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,725
You...

422
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,160
You, get over here!

423
00:28:11,195 --> 00:28:12,165
Matthew!

424
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,165
You killed us!

425
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,245
You killed all of us!

426
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,200
Stop!
You're hurting her!

427
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,257
I'm sorry...

428
00:28:17,292 --> 00:28:18,946
I'm sorry!

429
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,600
I survived
Afghanistan,

430
00:28:21,635 --> 00:28:24,045
Chechnya, Darfur,

431
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,880
And this coward kills me

432
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,640
And the only woman
I ever truly loved!

433
00:28:27,675 --> 00:28:31,160
I'm sorry!

434
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,820
I'm sorry...

435
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,880
They told me
you were devils,

436
00:28:51,915 --> 00:28:53,365
Unclean,

437
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,525
That by killing you

438
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,205
I would free
our people,

439
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,320
That I'd be rewarded
in paradise.

440
00:28:59,355 --> 00:29:03,000
But there is no paradise,

441
00:29:03,035 --> 00:29:04,525
Only this place,

442
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,685
This land
of infidels.

443
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,760
So, because you didn't
get your reward,

444
00:29:08,795 --> 00:29:10,765
You're suddenly sorry
for what you did?

445
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,880
If they lied about paradise,
what else did they lie about?

446
00:29:14,915 --> 00:29:17,800
How is a person
supposed to live

447
00:29:17,835 --> 00:29:21,880
When everything
is a lie?

448
00:29:21,915 --> 00:29:23,405
Soldiers!

449
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,080
Who the hell
are these guys?

450
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,525
Conquistadors.

451
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,605
That's a spanish flag.

452
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,640
All right, honey,
you stay here.

453
00:29:35,675 --> 00:29:36,605
No!

454
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,680
No, no, no,
I'll handle these clowns.

455
00:29:37,715 --> 00:29:38,680
Hey! Hey, you!

456
00:29:38,715 --> 00:29:39,480
Daniel...

457
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,245
Hey, what are
you doing?

458
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,400
You guys can't just
waltz in here.

459
00:29:45,435 --> 00:29:46,360
That's enough.

460
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,520
Hey, hey, hey,
who are you guys?

461
00:29:48,555 --> 00:29:49,725
Huh? What's going on?

462
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,720
You will not address
El Adelantado

463
00:29:53,755 --> 00:29:54,800
Without permission,
peasant.

464
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,480
Okay, shorty, listen,

465
00:29:57,515 --> 00:29:58,525
I'm an american attorney,

466
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,360
And I'll address
whoever I damn well please,

467
00:30:00,395 --> 00:30:02,160
Including the,
man of La Mancha here.

468
00:30:02,195 --> 00:30:03,277
Nice outfit...

469
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,920
No, you will be
slaughtered!

470
00:30:05,955 --> 00:30:07,320
Silencio.

471
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,840
Daniel!

472
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,480
No! No!

473
00:30:17,755 --> 00:30:19,725
You will all bow down

474
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,520
To your new lord and master!

475
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:30,360
May I present
the governor-general of Peru,

476
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:32,600
Conqueror of the incas,

477
00:30:32,635 --> 00:30:34,240
Francisco Pizarro.

478
00:30:34,275 --> 00:30:37,560
Pizarro?

479
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,680
Heed the words
of El Adelantado!

480
00:30:45,715 --> 00:30:49,085
Poor ignorant bastards.

481
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,300
You have no idea where you are,

482
00:30:51,335 --> 00:30:53,445
Or what is happening to you.

483
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:57,640
I will make everything
simple, huh?

484
00:30:57,675 --> 00:30:59,405
Clear.

485
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,805
This world,

486
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,180
This Riverworld,

487
00:31:03,215 --> 00:31:05,485
Is a purgatory,

488
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,245
Constructed
by demons,

489
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,120
And overrun by pagans
and idolaters,

490
00:31:10,155 --> 00:31:11,805
Not so different

491
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,240
From the depraved
savages

492
00:31:13,275 --> 00:31:16,005
Of the americas

493
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,840
Before we spaniards
brought them to heel.

494
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,520
What this world
needs

495
00:31:22,555 --> 00:31:25,005
Is vision.

496
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,400
It needs order.

497
00:31:27,435 --> 00:31:29,725
I have that vision,

498
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:34,400
And I will provide
that order,

499
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:35,977
And you,

500
00:31:36,012 --> 00:31:37,485
All of you,

501
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,520
Will help me
in this divine mission,

502
00:31:41,555 --> 00:31:43,725
Or...

503
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,320
I will make you
suffer

504
00:31:46,355 --> 00:31:48,880
Until you beg
for death.

505
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,205
Matthew...

506
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,085
Your wound,
it is healed.

507
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,600
Things must
heal quickly here.

508
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,205
Show your grailband,

509
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,440
And remember,
one third of your food is ours.

510
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:27,640
Anyone taking alcohol
or drugs from the stone

511
00:32:27,675 --> 00:32:28,725
Will be punished.

512
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,620
Well, this just keeps
getting better.

513
00:32:31,655 --> 00:32:34,480
I'm almost glad
Antonio's not here...

514
00:32:34,515 --> 00:32:35,885
Almost.

515
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,260
We have to get away.

516
00:32:37,295 --> 00:32:38,547
Too many soldiers.

517
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:39,765
We must be
patient,

518
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,365
Wait for
an opportunity.

519
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,480
Oh, hey,
your grailband.

520
00:32:45,515 --> 00:32:46,645
Why don't you get lost?

521
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,960
We'll scrape up
enough to feed you.

522
00:32:48,995 --> 00:32:51,360
You, come with me!

523
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,240
This way, move!

524
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,960
Where are you
taking me?

525
00:32:59,995 --> 00:33:03,560
What did I do wrong?

526
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,140
Antonio?

527
00:33:08,175 --> 00:33:09,925
Oh, my God!

528
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,725
You're alive.
Thank God!

529
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,880
There's too much
to explain right now.

530
00:33:12,915 --> 00:33:13,880
We have to be
very careful.

531
00:33:13,915 --> 00:33:15,445
Just know

532
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,040
That I'm going to find a way
to get us out of here, okay?

533
00:33:18,075 --> 00:33:19,845
Okay?

534
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,080
Do you get to keep the uniform?

535
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,360
18 months
I've been looking for you.

536
00:33:26,395 --> 00:33:28,085
I'd almost given up hope.

537
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,560
A year and a half?
How is that possible?

538
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,445
Welcome to Riverworld.

539
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,760
I hope you like
mac and cheese.

540
00:33:35,795 --> 00:33:37,040
Are you kidding?
Comfort food.

541
00:33:37,075 --> 00:33:39,245
Thanks.

542
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,820
Work harder!

543
00:33:40,855 --> 00:33:42,325
Antonio...

544
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,720
How many people did you
see in your travels?

545
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:44,725
Thousands.

546
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,920
I think people
from all across time

547
00:33:45,955 --> 00:33:47,080
Are constantly
being resurrected

548
00:33:47,115 --> 00:33:48,280
On these riverbanks.

549
00:33:48,315 --> 00:33:49,477
But why?

550
00:33:49,512 --> 00:33:50,605
Why?

551
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,885
Beats me.

552
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,040
But there has to
be some logic,

553
00:33:53,075 --> 00:33:54,245
Some connection,

554
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,520
Or none of us would
have found each other.

555
00:33:55,555 --> 00:33:57,205
Look, the only thing I know is

556
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,200
We've got to find a way
to get out of here.

557
00:33:59,235 --> 00:34:01,805
You, beat it!

558
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,380
Some kind of ship's
coming upriver.

559
00:34:03,415 --> 00:34:04,727
Pizarro's been
chasing it for years.

560
00:34:04,762 --> 00:34:06,040
He's going to ambush it
from this fort.

561
00:34:06,075 --> 00:34:07,525
This is good.

562
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,200
When the fighting starts,
we can run.

563
00:34:10,235 --> 00:34:12,840
There will be much
chaos and confusion.

564
00:34:12,875 --> 00:34:13,885
In the meantime,

565
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,920
We've got to do
whatever we can

566
00:34:14,955 --> 00:34:16,045
To screw this guy.

567
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,320
That means we work slow,
we make mistakes,

568
00:34:18,355 --> 00:34:19,440
We sabotage weapons...

569
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,620
That one.

570
00:34:22,655 --> 00:34:23,925
Arrest him.

571
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,480
You heard the man.

572
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,840
Please,
sit down.

573
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:45,720
I'm fine standing.

574
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,760
Sitting's good.

575
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,560
Show me your wrist.

576
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,560
Peramo.

577
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,840
Unbound, huh?

578
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:03,445
Like me.

579
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,085
You don't look like
a soldier, but...

580
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:16,360
I am told you have been
through many battles.

581
00:35:16,395 --> 00:35:18,880
I was a war zone reporter.

582
00:35:18,915 --> 00:35:20,325
That's a man who...

583
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,205
I know what a reporter is, huh?

584
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,080
All the time crying to the world
about the weak.

585
00:35:24,115 --> 00:35:26,560
But there have
always been weak, huh?

586
00:35:26,595 --> 00:35:27,885
And strong.

587
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,560
Which are you, senor Ellman?

588
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:32,285
Which should I be?

589
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,840
If I'm weak,
you'll take advantage.

590
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:35,557
If I'm strong, I'm a threat,

591
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:37,240
And you might have me killed.

592
00:35:41,375 --> 00:35:43,565
Very clever.

593
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,725
You're american, si?

594
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,720
I have seen far
too many americans

595
00:35:47,755 --> 00:35:50,457
Since I have
arrived here, huh?

596
00:35:50,492 --> 00:35:53,125
Oh, so noble in their hearts,

597
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,640
But they have
no concept of glory,

598
00:35:55,675 --> 00:35:58,085
Only an overweening
selfishness.

599
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:02,120
They want everyone
to be just like them.

600
00:36:02,155 --> 00:36:04,557
They are children.

601
00:36:04,592 --> 00:36:06,925
They are not men.

602
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,845
This may surprise you,

603
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,760
But history
didn't treat you kindly.

604
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:13,897
Are we through?

605
00:36:13,932 --> 00:36:15,586
Please, please.

606
00:36:15,621 --> 00:36:16,970
Be patient, huh?

607
00:36:17,005 --> 00:36:18,285
You're my guest.

608
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,925
You see, I'm curious,
senor Ellman,

609
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,960
Where is it that you think
that you are going?

610
00:36:22,995 --> 00:36:25,325
Have you a plan,

611
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,005
A destination
in mind?

612
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,800
Or are you
looking for something?

613
00:36:30,835 --> 00:36:32,765
Or someone?

614
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,920
Did Burton tell you that?

615
00:36:34,955 --> 00:36:36,777
Ah, you know my new friend.

616
00:36:36,812 --> 00:36:38,565
Burton doesn't strike me

617
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,080
As the kind of man
who makes friends.

618
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:41,005
No.

619
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,960
No, but we are brothers,
of a sort,

620
00:36:43,995 --> 00:36:46,217
Burton and I, huh?

621
00:36:46,252 --> 00:36:48,405
The question is,

622
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,285
Whose brother are you?

623
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,840
I don't know what you mean.

624
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,920
You're unbound.

625
00:36:58,955 --> 00:37:01,405
No grailband, huh?

626
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,880
But you must have been helped
somewhere along the way, huh?

627
00:37:05,915 --> 00:37:07,805
Was it a...

628
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,160
Was it a man or a woman?

629
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,780
Look, I woke up here yesterday.

630
00:37:12,815 --> 00:37:14,840
I don't know anything
about sides.

631
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,800
I could end you,
senor Ellman,

632
00:37:19,835 --> 00:37:22,520
Like I have ended
so many others...

633
00:37:22,555 --> 00:37:24,085
Emperors,
noblemen.

634
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,440
Your blood would be
little more

635
00:37:25,475 --> 00:37:26,800
Than an insignificant drop

636
00:37:26,835 --> 00:37:30,485
In a vast red sea.

637
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:34,360
You can kill me,
but I'll come back, won't I?

638
00:37:34,395 --> 00:37:37,437
Just like you
and everyone else here.

639
00:37:37,472 --> 00:37:40,445
I haven't seen anyone
really old.

640
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,400
Do you just kill yourself
and start again?

641
00:37:43,435 --> 00:37:44,325
Is that the secret?

642
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,360
There are
endless secrets

643
00:37:47,395 --> 00:37:50,457
Within secrets,

644
00:37:50,492 --> 00:37:53,485
None of which

645
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,800
You have earned
the right to know, hmm?

646
00:37:56,835 --> 00:37:58,400
Best I keep
an eye on you.

647
00:37:58,435 --> 00:38:01,200
Put him in irons.

648
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,160
Where did they take Matt?

649
00:38:14,195 --> 00:38:15,365
I'll find Matt.

650
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,520
Just keep doing your dirty work,
but don't get caught.

651
00:38:17,555 --> 00:38:21,160
Work harder or starve!

652
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,405
Bernardo, come!

653
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,280
I have to show you something.

654
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,365
Thank you.

655
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,485
Thank you very much.

656
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,440
Haven't had a nice meal
of knuckles and dirt

657
00:39:46,475 --> 00:39:48,640
Since my last
birthday,

658
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,320
You son
of a bitches.

659
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,720
Our first category
is "three strikes."

660
00:39:54,755 --> 00:39:56,765
For 200 dollars,

661
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,845
"these three outings

662
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,800
Should never
have been undertaken."

663
00:40:01,835 --> 00:40:04,640
What is
the titanic,

664
00:40:04,675 --> 00:40:07,045
The hindenberg,

665
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,720
And Matt Ellman's
new year's eve party

666
00:40:08,755 --> 00:40:10,280
On the staten island
ferry!

667
00:40:10,315 --> 00:40:11,440
Come here.

668
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:14,080
Look at you!

669
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,200
It's good to see you, man.

670
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,240
Last glimpse I had of you,

671
00:40:22,275 --> 00:40:24,160
You were lying in your coffin.

672
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,685
Sorry, man.

673
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,760
I'm sorry for
staring at you.

674
00:40:27,795 --> 00:40:29,357
I just can't
believe it's you.

675
00:40:29,392 --> 00:40:30,920
Matt Ellman
is in the house!

676
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,565
What are you
doing here?

677
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,320
Oh, that's a sorry,
sorry story.

678
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:42,245
I had four numbers

679
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,420
When this thing
went down.

680
00:40:44,455 --> 00:40:46,560
I never got
to see a fifth.

681
00:40:46,595 --> 00:40:48,240
What went down?

682
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,920
The world, I think.

683
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,685
What are you talking about?

684
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,400
I was monitoring
my police scanner,

685
00:40:58,435 --> 00:41:00,177
And there was
lots of chatter.

686
00:41:00,212 --> 00:41:01,786
They scrambled
f-16s, man.

687
00:41:01,821 --> 00:41:03,360
It was bad juju,
really bad.

688
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,720
You're serious?

689
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,485
Yeah.

690
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,245
Nasa was monitoring some ufo,

691
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,120
And then it vaporized
the entire earth.

692
00:41:14,155 --> 00:41:15,565
When?

693
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,765
Six years after you died.

694
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,280
You died
six years after singapore?

695
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,800
So, you've just been wandering
this whole time?

696
00:41:25,835 --> 00:41:28,040
Yeah.

697
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,165
Simon...

698
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,600
Have you seen her?

699
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,885
Jessie...

700
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,885
I heard she was upriver

701
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,440
Running from this guy
named Burton.

702
00:41:40,475 --> 00:41:42,925
Look, I tried
to find her, man,

703
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,160
But I kept on running into
this dude and his men,

704
00:41:45,195 --> 00:41:46,765
And they killed me.

705
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,480
I'm not talking about
a bunch of clowns

706
00:41:48,515 --> 00:41:52,000
Who slayed me
with their humour.

707
00:41:52,035 --> 00:41:52,880
I'm sorry.

708
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,920
You've died again, here?

709
00:41:55,955 --> 00:41:57,805
Twice.

710
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,840
So we do keep coming back...

711
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,960
Yeah, but I don't recommend it.

712
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,000
Dude, I'm so glad
you're here.

713
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,360
You too, buddy.

714
00:42:15,395 --> 00:42:16,917
Yeah.

715
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,925
Damn.

716
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,880
Another
accident?

717
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,960
Flooded ditches,
cracked oil drums,

718
00:42:33,995 --> 00:42:35,125
Loose support beams.

719
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,920
It's astonishing
how many things have gone wrong

720
00:42:36,955 --> 00:42:39,520
With this little project.

721
00:42:39,555 --> 00:42:41,245
What do
you want?

722
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,125
A stroll along the thames,

723
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,720
And a maxim gun
with a few thousand rounds,

724
00:42:45,755 --> 00:42:46,957
And a night with a hindi girl

725
00:42:46,992 --> 00:42:48,125
Well-versed in the Kama Sutra.

726
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,600
Unfortunately,
I have to make do with you

727
00:42:49,635 --> 00:42:51,765
And the rest of
your sorry lot.

728
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,840
I know you think
you're being very clever

729
00:42:52,875 --> 00:42:54,440
With this sabotage of yours,

730
00:42:54,475 --> 00:42:55,965
But the problem is

731
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,760
That each misstep you make
is going to be taken

732
00:42:57,795 --> 00:43:01,257
Out of your dear
Mr. Ellman's flesh,

733
00:43:01,292 --> 00:43:04,720
And, yes, you will
be there to watch.

734
00:43:04,755 --> 00:43:06,485
Take him away,

735
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,120
And bring me
Mr. Ellman.

736
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,345
Senor Ellman,

737
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:26,340
Have you ever heard of
diego de almagro?

738
00:43:26,375 --> 00:43:28,300
Diego and I were
brothers-in-arms, huh?

739
00:43:28,335 --> 00:43:29,465
Amigos.

740
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,280
Together, we conquered
the inca empire,

741
00:43:31,315 --> 00:43:33,060
Laid low atahualpa,
and shook the word.

742
00:43:33,095 --> 00:43:35,420
But when
the king made me

743
00:43:35,455 --> 00:43:37,825
Emperor of Peru,

744
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:40,140
Diego, he became
jealous, huh?

745
00:43:40,175 --> 00:43:41,220
And he betrayed me.

746
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,425
Should I be taking notes?

747
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:46,540
Cause if there's
going to be a quiz...

748
00:43:48,332 --> 00:43:50,020
I thought perhaps

749
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:52,660
His fate will be
illustrative.

750
00:43:52,695 --> 00:43:54,817
I rebuilt my army,

751
00:43:54,852 --> 00:43:56,905
Freed my brothers,

752
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,425
Laid siege to his city,

753
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:00,420
And defeated the cur in battle,

754
00:44:00,455 --> 00:44:02,825
And diego...

755
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:07,140
He begged
for his miserable life.

756
00:44:07,175 --> 00:44:09,105
He cried like a woman

757
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:12,465
As I slowly
strangled him to death.

758
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:16,020
Well, there'll be no crying
here, my friend.

759
00:44:16,055 --> 00:44:17,145
Burn him alive.

760
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:20,180
El Adelantado, a word.

761
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,220
Don't kill him,
not yet.

762
00:44:27,255 --> 00:44:28,265
Why not?

763
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,225
What will happen?

764
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:30,345
You tell me now, Burton,

765
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:31,620
Or I throw you
on the pyre with him!

766
00:44:31,655 --> 00:44:32,745
He has
no grailband.

767
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:35,625
Draw your own
conclusion.

768
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:39,020
You think I have friends
with the caretakers...

769
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,940
What does he know
of this?

770
00:44:44,975 --> 00:44:46,505
Probably nothing,

771
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:48,620
But I suggest
we keep him alive

772
00:44:48,655 --> 00:44:51,500
Till we know.

773
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:59,665
Senor Ellman...

774
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,140
Please forgive me, huh?

775
00:45:02,175 --> 00:45:04,217
I am but a...

776
00:45:04,252 --> 00:45:06,225
Barbarian.

777
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:09,460
Bernardo, show our friend
to our finest...

778
00:45:09,495 --> 00:45:10,420
Accommodations.

779
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,180
I can't shoot this, man.

780
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,700
My money...

781
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:28,660
Let's set up.

782
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:32,600
Simon, let's go.

783
00:46:32,635 --> 00:46:33,887
Let's get this done.

784
00:46:33,922 --> 00:46:35,140
No, you leave now.

785
00:46:35,175 --> 00:46:38,105
Men coming.

786
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:39,740
This is
what we came for.

787
00:46:39,775 --> 00:46:40,985
You got your money.

788
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:42,820
The guy said let's go,
so let's go.

789
00:46:42,855 --> 00:46:45,057
He's lying, okay?

790
00:46:45,092 --> 00:46:47,225
Do you see anything?

791
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:49,860
Let's do this.

792
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,945
This is Matt Ellman.

793
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,380
I'm standing in front of
a mass grave

794
00:46:58,415 --> 00:46:59,780
Here in the mountains
of chechnya...

795
00:47:54,395 --> 00:47:56,265
Simon!

796
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:59,585
Simon...

797
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:03,425
Simon...

798
00:48:04,975 --> 00:48:06,277
Simon?

799
00:48:06,312 --> 00:48:07,545
Simon!

800
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:09,200
Simon, get up!

801
00:48:09,235 --> 00:48:10,785
Get up, man!

802
00:48:12,635 --> 00:48:14,380
Come on, buddy.

803
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,040
I got you.

804
00:48:17,075 --> 00:48:18,380
I got you...

805
00:48:18,415 --> 00:48:20,065
Okay...

806
00:48:21,615 --> 00:48:22,945
No!

807
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:31,820
Eat, eat!

808
00:48:31,855 --> 00:48:33,020
Eat!

809
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:39,140
Bastardo.

810
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:56,780
Tomoe, what
are you doing?

811
00:48:56,815 --> 00:48:59,017
Matthew's still
alive, barely.

812
00:48:59,052 --> 00:49:01,220
We've got to get him
out of here.

813
00:49:01,255 --> 00:49:02,305
It's difficult.

814
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:03,340
He's under
constant guard.

815
00:49:03,375 --> 00:49:05,465
Woman, here!

816
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,465
A share goes to us!

817
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,860
You, get us
some more food, now!

818
00:49:25,775 --> 00:49:28,277
I got you.

819
00:49:28,312 --> 00:49:30,780
I got you...

820
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:51,385
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

821
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:52,665
<i>It was an accident...</i>

822
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:54,580
<i>You can't keep
beating yourself up over it</i>

823
00:49:54,615 --> 00:49:55,540
<i>Your entire life.</i>

824
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:56,700
I'm sorry.

825
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:08,580
I'm coming, baby.

826
00:50:22,055 --> 00:50:22,980
You.

827
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:27,625
Where's Jessie?

828
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:30,220
She's still
waiting for you, Matt.

829
00:50:30,255 --> 00:50:33,105
She needs you.

830
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:36,185
Get to the river and find Sam.

831
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:39,820
He'll help you,
but you must find Sam.

832
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:43,340
Sam.

833
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:46,780
What do you know about Sam?

834
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:52,980
What do you know about Sam?

835
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,580
What do you know
about Sam?

836
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:02,865
Run!

837
00:51:04,315 --> 00:51:05,660
Run free!

838
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:06,797
No!

839
00:51:06,832 --> 00:51:07,900
No!

840
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:16,780
Risoner escaped!

841
00:51:16,815 --> 00:51:18,980
Prisoner e escaped!

842
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:21,660
Sword.

843
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:00,060
Get out of my way!

844
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:21,345
Fire!

845
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:34,300
Fall back!

846
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:45,460
Stop!

847
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:55,620
No grailband.

848
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:59,900
Are you Sam?

849
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:17,360
Launch ahead.

850
00:53:17,395 --> 00:53:18,905
Dead slow.

851
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:21,380
Linesmen to starboard.

852
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:34,900
Youseff, how many times
do we have to tell you,

853
00:53:34,935 --> 00:53:36,225
No strays.

854
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:39,940
Hold up your wrist.

855
00:53:39,975 --> 00:53:41,180
No grailband.

856
00:53:41,215 --> 00:53:45,265
Like me.

857
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,100
Are you "Sam?"

858
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:50,305
I'm Matt Ellman.

859
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:51,900
A caretaker told me to find you.

860
00:53:51,935 --> 00:53:54,100
Male or female?

861
00:53:54,135 --> 00:53:55,545
A woman,

862
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,460
While I was in Pizarro's camp.

863
00:53:59,612 --> 00:54:01,625
Pizarro.

864
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:03,665
So he is waiting for us.

865
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:06,460
We ambushed
some conquistadors upstream.

866
00:54:06,495 --> 00:54:07,985
They were chasing him.

867
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:09,780
They say the enemy
of my enemy

868
00:54:09,815 --> 00:54:11,865
Is my friend.

869
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:13,340
Are you my friend,
Mr. Ellman?

870
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:14,985
Maybe,

871
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:16,540
Once I get to know you.

872
00:54:18,052 --> 00:54:19,425
My apologies.

873
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:21,820
I have been remiss
in my introductions.

874
00:54:21,855 --> 00:54:24,180
Well, you've met
our chief of marines,

875
00:54:24,215 --> 00:54:25,825
Youseff mbaye.

876
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:28,840
Mademoiselle fabarge,

877
00:54:28,875 --> 00:54:31,785
My chief
engineer,

878
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:35,425
And this lovely
creature,

879
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:36,940
This is
Allegra Braccioforte...

880
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:42,665
My diplomatic liaison.

881
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:45,820
And I am the owner and operator
of this fabulous riverboat,

882
00:54:45,855 --> 00:54:47,545
The not-for-hire.

883
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:50,460
Captain Samuel Clemens,
at your service.

884
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:52,477
Samuel Clemens?

885
00:54:52,512 --> 00:54:55,246
As in Mark Twain?

886
00:54:55,281 --> 00:54:57,850
Guilty as charged.

887
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:11,665
Impressive.

888
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,745
You don't look impressed.

889
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:16,460
Frankly, you remind me
of a dyspeptic cat,

890
00:55:16,495 --> 00:55:18,345
Like you swallowed
somethin',

891
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:19,945
And you're about to
cough it back up.

892
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:23,540
I think, meeting you,
it's made it all hit home...

893
00:55:23,575 --> 00:55:27,420
Mark Twain giving me
a tour of his riverboat.

894
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:32,385
This place...

895
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:35,580
It's not just a dream,
is it?

896
00:55:35,615 --> 00:55:38,197
We really are dead.

897
00:55:38,232 --> 00:55:40,745
Dead and reborn.

898
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:43,740
I woke up here
five years ago.

899
00:55:43,775 --> 00:55:44,985
If I am dead,

900
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:48,100
Then this is
the longest dream ever.

901
00:55:50,232 --> 00:55:52,225
Millions,

902
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:53,985
Or perhaps billions
of people

903
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:57,945
From every epoch
of human history,

904
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:01,500
Reborn along the banks
of a seemingly endless river.

905
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:06,300
Basic needs all provided for...

906
00:56:06,335 --> 00:56:08,317
But no children...

907
00:56:08,352 --> 00:56:10,886
No old people...

908
00:56:10,921 --> 00:56:13,385
No civilization.

909
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:15,820
The question,
Mr. Ellman, is, why?

910
00:56:15,855 --> 00:56:19,020
What is the point
of it all?

911
00:56:19,055 --> 00:56:20,825
Is it a chance to atone?

912
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:23,120
For what we screwed up
in life?

913
00:56:23,155 --> 00:56:25,345
Life is
a considerable test.

914
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:26,820
Having endured
its random cruelties

915
00:56:26,855 --> 00:56:28,105
For 75 years,

916
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:31,020
I see no reason
for a make-up exam.

917
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:34,500
Do you have
a better explanation?

918
00:56:34,535 --> 00:56:36,145
Nope.

919
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:38,865
But I do intend to find one.

920
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,500
That's why I built
the not-for-hire

921
00:56:40,535 --> 00:56:42,545
In the first place.

922
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:44,060
You didn't build it.
You stole it!

923
00:56:44,095 --> 00:56:45,625
I earned this ship.

924
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:47,460
I found
the raw materials,

925
00:56:47,495 --> 00:56:49,105
The engineers,

926
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:50,840
Convinced Pizarro
to provide the labour.

927
00:56:50,875 --> 00:56:52,540
Yeah, by telling him
he could use it

928
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:53,980
To conquer the world.

929
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:56,825
That was a good trick, huh?

930
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:59,340
The ship and the girl
all at once.

931
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:00,697
"the girl?"

932
00:57:00,732 --> 00:57:01,985
Allegra.

933
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:04,180
She used to be
Pizarro's woman,

934
00:57:04,215 --> 00:57:06,340
Until Sam...

935
00:57:06,375 --> 00:57:08,025
Won her heart.

936
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:10,065
Pizarro was not happy.

937
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:13,100
The man takes his grudges
very seriously.

938
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:20,220
So, why are we
on this journey?

939
00:57:20,255 --> 00:57:22,220
Every river has its source.

940
00:57:22,255 --> 00:57:23,545
I'm convinced

941
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:25,580
That, at the source of
this particular river,

942
00:57:25,615 --> 00:57:27,905
We shall find its creators,

943
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:31,980
And, hence, those responsible
for our new existence.

944
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:33,620
So, you're going to go
to the "source,"

945
00:57:33,655 --> 00:57:35,545
Find the gods, or God,

946
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:37,640
Or little green men
that made this place,

947
00:57:37,675 --> 00:57:39,700
And force them to give you
an explanation?

948
00:57:39,735 --> 00:57:41,385
That's the plan.

949
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:45,780
And, you, my friend,
you're gonna make it possible.

950
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:02,740
They've spotted the ship!

951
00:58:02,775 --> 00:58:04,837
It's coming upriver!

952
00:58:04,872 --> 00:58:06,900
It won't be long now.

953
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:28,300
El Adelantado,
they are 10 miles out,

954
00:58:28,335 --> 00:58:30,665
Moving dead slow
in deep water.

955
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:34,660
Does he think
he can just steam past?

956
00:58:34,695 --> 00:58:35,660
Well, let's hope
he tries.

957
00:58:35,695 --> 00:58:36,585
He can't get by

958
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:37,900
Without coming in range
of our weapons.

959
00:58:37,935 --> 00:58:39,517
You're surprisingly
self-confident

960
00:58:39,552 --> 00:58:41,100
For a man who was
just defeated

961
00:58:41,135 --> 00:58:42,897
By an aboriginal army

962
00:58:42,932 --> 00:58:44,625
And a man on foot.

963
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:47,820
It wasn't my men who turned
and ran like little girls,

964
00:58:47,855 --> 00:58:50,220
I can assure you
of that.

965
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:55,860
That's the channel where
Youseff saved my butt.

966
00:58:55,895 --> 00:58:58,025
It had a strong current,

967
00:58:58,060 --> 00:59:00,220
So it probably joins
back up to the main river

968
00:59:00,255 --> 00:59:03,100
Somewhere here...
Above the fort.

969
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:06,500
Well, it's a riverboat...

970
00:59:06,535 --> 00:59:08,260
Only draws three feet.

971
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:09,585
Just might work.

972
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:11,225
So now, if I do this,

973
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:13,820
How do I know you'll keep
your end of the bargain

974
00:59:13,855 --> 00:59:15,300
And help me find Jessie?

975
00:59:15,335 --> 00:59:17,425
You don't.

976
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:19,980
It's a quandary,
I know,

977
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:22,477
But... Look
at this face.

978
00:59:22,512 --> 00:59:24,940
Would this face
lie to you?

979
00:59:24,975 --> 00:59:26,237
In a heartbeat.

980
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,260
It's true...
I am a habitual mendicant,

981
00:59:29,295 --> 00:59:31,577
But I pay my debts,

982
00:59:31,612 --> 00:59:33,825
Not because I'm honest,

983
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:36,620
But because I dislike intensely
being obliged to another man.

984
00:59:36,655 --> 00:59:38,417
So, if you give me
your assistance

985
00:59:38,452 --> 00:59:40,180
You will have my help
in return,

986
00:59:40,215 --> 00:59:41,620
Measure for measure.

987
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:46,620
And the others?
The ones back in Pizarro's camp?

988
00:59:46,655 --> 00:59:47,865
What about them?

989
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:52,220
I'm afraid they will have to
look out for themselves.

990
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:53,705
It strikes me, Burton,

991
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:57,420
That trusting you
could be a serious error.

992
00:59:57,455 --> 00:59:58,977
That so?

993
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:00,465
How can I be certain

994
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,780
That you're not
an agent of the enemy?

995
01:00:02,815 --> 01:00:04,517
Certainty is a luxury,
my friend,

996
01:00:04,552 --> 01:00:05,986
Along with clarity,
faith, sanity...

997
01:00:06,021 --> 01:00:07,385
All those
other foolish notions

998
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:08,460
We clung to in
our previous existence.

999
01:00:08,495 --> 01:00:10,460
Do not tempt fate,
my friend...

1000
01:00:10,495 --> 01:00:11,465
Look out!

1001
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:20,825
You are a mad woman.

1002
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:22,745
Why do you
throw your life away?

1003
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:25,100
You killed her husband
the day you rode in.

1004
01:00:25,135 --> 01:00:26,517
Ah, si, si...

1005
01:00:26,552 --> 01:00:27,865
I'd forgotten.

1006
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:30,660
It was of such
little significance.

1007
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:34,500
Burn her at the stake.

1008
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:39,145
No!

1009
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:08,065
Youseff?

1010
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:11,180
When you were alive,
you were a soldier, right?

1011
01:01:11,215 --> 01:01:13,140
I was a taxi driver.

1012
01:01:13,175 --> 01:01:14,425
In Dakar.

1013
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:15,945
My brother
was the soldier.

1014
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:19,180
He was a sergeant
in the tirailleurs senegalais,

1015
01:01:19,215 --> 01:01:22,020
But I had a family,
so I stayed home.

1016
01:01:22,055 --> 01:01:23,420
Then what's with the hat?

1017
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:28,425
Allah gave me a second life.

1018
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:31,300
What is the point living it
the same way I did my first?

1019
01:01:31,335 --> 01:01:33,700
So I am a soldier...

1020
01:01:33,735 --> 01:01:34,665
Now,

1021
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:37,060
And I've been one
for six years.

1022
01:01:37,095 --> 01:01:38,497
Why?

1023
01:01:38,532 --> 01:01:39,865
Tell me,

1024
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:42,540
Does Sam's plan have
a chance in hell of working?

1025
01:01:42,575 --> 01:01:44,625
Insha'Allah...

1026
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:47,585
It is in the hands of Allah,

1027
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:50,500
Or whatever he is called
in this place.

1028
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:02,540
Three years
to build this boat...

1029
01:02:02,575 --> 01:02:04,905
Another two years of runnin'...

1030
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:06,900
It all comes down to this.

1031
01:02:06,935 --> 01:02:09,900
It's not good
to worry so much.

1032
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:13,825
The rich and powerful
of venice

1033
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:16,420
Must've lined the grand
canal outside your door.

1034
01:02:16,455 --> 01:02:18,025
Too bourgeois.

1035
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:19,920
I had an apprentice
arrange it

1036
01:02:19,955 --> 01:02:21,780
So my lovers
never saw each other.

1037
01:02:21,815 --> 01:02:24,097
Each could
delude himself

1038
01:02:24,132 --> 01:02:26,380
Into believing
I was his...

1039
01:02:26,415 --> 01:02:28,985
And his alone.

1040
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:32,905
I suffer no such delusions,
my dear.

1041
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:35,500
I'm content to be among
the unwashed multitudes.

1042
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:38,740
I was thinking...

1043
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:42,025
Perhaps I should
get closer

1044
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:43,860
To our new friend,
senor Ellman.

1045
01:02:43,895 --> 01:02:45,585
Take a peek,

1046
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:48,060
See if he has
something to hide.

1047
01:02:48,095 --> 01:02:50,500
Are you trying
to make me jealous?

1048
01:02:50,535 --> 01:02:51,740
Are you trying
to pretend

1049
01:02:51,775 --> 01:02:53,065
It's not working?

1050
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:57,060
Let us endeavor to get past
the spaniard first.

1051
01:02:58,220 --> 01:03:01,900
And then we can discuss
your machiavellian designs

1052
01:03:01,935 --> 01:03:03,540
On young Mr. Ellman.

1053
01:03:03,575 --> 01:03:05,105
Machiavelli...

1054
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:08,180
Now, there was a man
who knew how to treat a lady.

1055
01:03:08,215 --> 01:03:10,220
Incorrigible.

1056
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:18,780
Matthew?

1057
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:23,820
Matthew.

1058
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:26,980
Matthew...

1059
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:30,540
Matt... Matthew!

1060
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:36,025
Matthew.

1061
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:41,025
What do you want?

1062
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:42,760
Burton is still alive.

1063
01:03:42,795 --> 01:03:44,425
You have to stop him.

1064
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:48,260
I'm not good at taking orders,
never have been.

1065
01:03:48,295 --> 01:03:49,705
Kill Burton.

1066
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:51,160
It is the only way

1067
01:03:51,195 --> 01:03:52,580
To save Jessica.

1068
01:03:52,615 --> 01:03:53,625
Look.

1069
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:55,340
You want me to kill someone?

1070
01:03:55,375 --> 01:03:56,465
I'm going to need

1071
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:57,620
A little more
information.

1072
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:05,145
Great.

1073
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:06,860
Really helpful.

1074
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:23,820
What is that?

1075
01:04:23,855 --> 01:04:24,905
That...

1076
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:27,220
Is none of
your damn business.

1077
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:39,825
The engine room was locked,

1078
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:41,540
But there he was,
nosing around.

1079
01:04:41,575 --> 01:04:43,097
You have to forgive
poor amelie.

1080
01:04:43,132 --> 01:04:44,620
She doesn't
like strange noses

1081
01:04:44,655 --> 01:04:46,225
In her private places.

1082
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:47,785
Excuse me,
but I don't open my door

1083
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:49,540
To every man
who's willing to pay the price.

1084
01:04:49,575 --> 01:04:51,225
Ladies! Ladies.

1085
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:53,505
Now, back to
the subject at hand.

1086
01:04:53,540 --> 01:04:55,980
Yeah. Like what's that thing
powering your ship?

1087
01:04:56,015 --> 01:04:59,185
It was a gift...

1088
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:00,900
From one of our protectors.

1089
01:05:00,935 --> 01:05:03,140
The woman caretaker?

1090
01:05:03,175 --> 01:05:04,785
Yes.

1091
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:06,305
She bequeathed it to me

1092
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:09,580
In exchange for some...
As-of-yet unnamed future favour.

1093
01:05:09,615 --> 01:05:11,717
Helping you, perhaps?

1094
01:05:11,752 --> 01:05:13,785
As to what it is?

1095
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:17,860
Mademoiselle fabarge
has her theories.

1096
01:05:17,895 --> 01:05:19,985
It might be
a fusion reactor,

1097
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:22,580
Fueled by the hydrogen
in the water.

1098
01:05:22,615 --> 01:05:24,185
That thing is nuclear?

1099
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:25,865
You see now
why it's important

1100
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:27,840
That this ship not fall
into the wrong hands?

1101
01:05:27,875 --> 01:05:29,780
How do we know this one
isn't the wrong hands?

1102
01:05:29,815 --> 01:05:30,985
Why are we trusting him?

1103
01:05:32,655 --> 01:05:34,117
We are in position.

1104
01:05:36,121 --> 01:05:38,020
Time to get to work.

1105
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:41,180
As to whether or not
we can trust you,

1106
01:05:41,215 --> 01:05:42,425
Mr. Ellman,

1107
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:43,820
I suppose
we shall see...

1108
01:05:43,855 --> 01:05:45,900
Directly.

1109
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:54,140
Help me!

1110
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:57,065
Somebody, help!

1111
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:59,300
They're going to
burn her at the stake!

1112
01:06:00,855 --> 01:06:03,100
It is time.

1113
01:06:05,575 --> 01:06:07,117
Time for what?

1114
01:06:07,152 --> 01:06:08,660
Time to be brave.

1115
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:13,300
Don't you think
we need a little help?

1116
01:06:13,335 --> 01:06:15,377
All the slaves
enjoy complaining,

1117
01:06:15,412 --> 01:06:17,420
But none will
risk their lives.

1118
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:20,400
There's a friend
of Matt's...

1119
01:06:20,435 --> 01:06:22,100
In prison,
his name's Simon.

1120
01:06:22,135 --> 01:06:23,705
Then bring him.

1121
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:27,700
The spaniard's lust for death
must be answered.

1122
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:54,860
Sounding.

1123
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:01,020
Half Twain.

1124
01:07:01,055 --> 01:07:02,545
Six feet?

1125
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:05,220
I've stepped
in deeper puddles.

1126
01:07:19,695 --> 01:07:21,585
The grailstone...

1127
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:23,140
That's where I was held
in the cage.

1128
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:26,780
Somebody, help me!

1129
01:07:26,815 --> 01:07:28,500
No!

1130
01:07:28,535 --> 01:07:31,105
No! No!

1131
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:37,420
Something
interests you, english?

1132
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:43,060
Thinhe t fox
has outfoxed the hounds.

1133
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:53,340
Clemens...

1134
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:55,025
On my ship!

1135
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:57,065
He's in behind us.

1136
01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:59,460
Conquistadors!

1137
01:07:59,495 --> 01:08:01,820
Reposition the catapults!

1138
01:08:01,855 --> 01:08:04,145
Now! Now!

1139
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:06,540
We're under attack!
We're under attack!

1140
01:08:06,575 --> 01:08:08,900
Go! Go! Go! Go!
We're under attack!

1141
01:08:08,935 --> 01:08:11,105
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go!

1142
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:13,500
Watch out, watch out,
watch out!

1143
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:19,140
Damn! That was cool.

1144
01:08:19,175 --> 01:08:20,197
Where's Matt?

1145
01:08:20,232 --> 01:08:21,185
Matthew's gone.

1146
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:23,425
El hefe's about to
roast Deborah,

1147
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:25,860
And three of us are going to
take on Pizarro's army.

1148
01:08:25,895 --> 01:08:27,145
Sound fun?

1149
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:28,460
No, that doesn't
sound like fun.

1150
01:08:29,415 --> 01:08:30,497
Come on!

1151
01:08:30,532 --> 01:08:31,580
Oh, geez!

1152
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:33,140
Come back here,
you cowards!

1153
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:37,220
Come!

1154
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:40,660
To the front!

1155
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:48,340
Please, release
our friend now.

1156
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:03,540
Prepare your soul.

1157
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:14,225
I am Tomoe Gozen,

1158
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:16,820
Swordswoman
of the minamoto clan,

1159
01:09:16,855 --> 01:09:19,025
Champion, consort,

1160
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:21,340
And war captain
to Kiso Yoshinaka.

1161
01:09:21,375 --> 01:09:23,865
I bow to no man.

1162
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:27,740
Please,
release our friend now.

1163
01:09:27,775 --> 01:09:29,465
Kill her.

1164
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:32,700
Kill them all.

1165
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:00,380
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

1166
01:10:00,415 --> 01:10:02,237
We have to keep moving.

1167
01:10:02,272 --> 01:10:04,025
Matthew, you cannot help.

1168
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:06,220
We have to
get past the fort.

1169
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:10,420
I got to borrow this.

1170
01:10:10,455 --> 01:10:12,437
Matthew!

1171
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:25,905
Let's go!

1172
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:27,820
But we're not fighting?

1173
01:10:27,855 --> 01:10:29,940
Not his battles.

1174
01:10:46,180 --> 01:10:47,265
Three-quarters Twain.

1175
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:49,100
It's getting deeper,
and we're past the camp.

1176
01:10:49,135 --> 01:10:50,820
Start the engines.
Get us out of here.

1177
01:10:50,855 --> 01:10:51,980
Not yet. We have
an agreement

1178
01:10:52,015 --> 01:10:53,065
With Mr. Ellman.

1179
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:54,680
You really
meant all that?

1180
01:10:54,715 --> 01:10:56,225
I thought
you had sense.

1181
01:10:56,260 --> 01:10:58,420
Sometimes, I don't know
why I tolerate you.

1182
01:10:58,455 --> 01:11:00,980
Well, we know
it's not for my cooking.

1183
01:11:01,015 --> 01:11:02,540
Burton, get your men!

1184
01:11:02,575 --> 01:11:03,625
Burton!

1185
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:08,440
Never trust a man
who eats blood pudding.

1186
01:11:08,475 --> 01:11:11,900
Santiago y cierra!
Conquistadores! Vamos!

1187
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:25,260
I'm a college professor.
What am I doing here?

1188
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:30,860
Oh... Antonio!
Look out!

1189
01:11:30,895 --> 01:11:32,477
Antonio!

1190
01:11:33,781 --> 01:11:34,980
No!

1191
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:37,700
Get him out of here!

1192
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:23,585
You never told me
you were a samurai.

1193
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:26,500
A samurai does not talk,
a samurai fights.

1194
01:12:26,535 --> 01:12:28,140
Conquistadores!

1195
01:12:37,075 --> 01:12:38,605
Deborah!

1196
01:12:43,052 --> 01:12:45,085
Encore!

1197
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,400
Mr. Youseff!

1198
01:12:47,435 --> 01:12:49,257
Vite! Vite!

1199
01:12:49,292 --> 01:12:51,080
Wait, wait! Go!

1200
01:12:51,115 --> 01:12:53,405
Go!

1201
01:13:04,995 --> 01:13:08,217
Youseff.

1202
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:13,620
You guys
seen Deborah?

1203
01:13:13,655 --> 01:13:15,765
You guys seen
Deborah?

1204
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:19,160
You know,
I think we did it.

1205
01:13:19,195 --> 01:13:21,317
I think we did it.

1206
01:13:23,475 --> 01:13:25,965
Hey, guys.

1207
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,880
Bet you didn't think
I was coming back.

1208
01:13:27,915 --> 01:13:29,365
You're such a dumbass,

1209
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:31,040
You're not even smart
enough to save yourself.

1210
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,720
As many times
as I've seen this,

1211
01:13:42,755 --> 01:13:44,817
I never get used to it.

1212
01:13:44,852 --> 01:13:46,880
We're not supposed to.

1213
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,760
Is that your friend?

1214
01:13:50,795 --> 01:13:52,200
I hope so.

1215
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:56,040
I sure as hell
don't want her as an enemy.

1216
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:01,240
Behind you!

1217
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:34,640
I am nothat easy to.

1218
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:41,840
Sure ya are.

1219
01:14:41,875 --> 01:14:43,537
Clemens...

1220
01:14:43,572 --> 01:14:45,200
Hello, Francisco.

1221
01:14:45,235 --> 01:14:47,365
Coward.

1222
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:50,405
In the back?

1223
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:53,000
I find, if you must shoot
a dangerous animal,

1224
01:14:53,035 --> 01:14:54,377
It's best to do it by surprise

1225
01:14:54,412 --> 01:14:55,720
And from
a considerable distance.

1226
01:15:02,651 --> 01:15:05,285
Strange...

1227
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:07,720
Thought I would enjoy that.

1228
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:12,440
You don't see this
every day.

1229
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:51,780
Burton escaped.

1230
01:15:51,815 --> 01:15:54,205
Gee, sorry...

1231
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:56,700
I was a little busy
trying not to get stabbed.

1232
01:15:56,735 --> 01:15:59,160
As long as Burton lives,
none of you are safe.

1233
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:03,640
The others don't see you.

1234
01:16:03,675 --> 01:16:05,880
This is a dream.

1235
01:16:05,915 --> 01:16:08,485
A message.

1236
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:11,160
Delivered
to the wrong person.

1237
01:16:11,195 --> 01:16:13,725
I'm not a killer.

1238
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:16,485
Why are you here,
Matthew Ellman?

1239
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:19,245
Have you asked yourself
that question?

1240
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:22,280
I'm still trying to figure out
what "here" is.

1241
01:16:22,315 --> 01:16:24,737
When this Riverworld
was created,

1242
01:16:24,772 --> 01:16:26,766
We believed
it could be a place

1243
01:16:26,801 --> 01:16:28,760
For your people
to be reborn,

1244
01:16:28,795 --> 01:16:30,565
A place for atonement,

1245
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:33,560
A second chance
to achieve perfection.

1246
01:16:33,595 --> 01:16:35,777
But there are
a few among us

1247
01:16:35,812 --> 01:16:37,706
Who believe
we have failed,

1248
01:16:37,741 --> 01:16:39,565
That you are not worthy,

1249
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,840
And so this world
must be destroyed.

1250
01:16:41,875 --> 01:16:43,880
You said "created."

1251
01:16:43,915 --> 01:16:45,325
By who?

1252
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:48,040
We cannot act directly
on your behalf.

1253
01:16:48,075 --> 01:16:50,317
Our laws forbid it.

1254
01:16:50,352 --> 01:16:52,560
But some have
seen fit

1255
01:16:52,595 --> 01:16:54,537
To ignore our laws

1256
01:16:54,572 --> 01:16:56,445
And interfere...

1257
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:59,720
To choose champions
among the awakened,

1258
01:16:59,755 --> 01:17:01,617
People
who they can use

1259
01:17:01,652 --> 01:17:03,445
To serve
their own ends.

1260
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:06,365
Burton is the champion
of the salvationists,

1261
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:08,960
A tool they intend to use
to destroy the Riverworld.

1262
01:17:08,995 --> 01:17:11,680
And I'm your champion?

1263
01:17:11,715 --> 01:17:13,777
Yes.

1264
01:17:13,812 --> 01:17:15,826
You...

1265
01:17:15,861 --> 01:17:17,850
Sam...

1266
01:17:17,885 --> 01:17:19,702
Jessica.

1267
01:17:19,737 --> 01:17:21,485
Jessica?

1268
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,420
Jessica is...

1269
01:17:23,455 --> 01:17:25,285
Our hope,

1270
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:28,320
But she is in great danger.

1271
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:33,400
Stop Burton.

1272
01:17:33,435 --> 01:17:35,917
For you...

1273
01:17:35,952 --> 01:17:37,876
For Jessica...

1274
01:17:37,911 --> 01:17:39,800
For all of us.

1275
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:06,365
Hey... You'll be okay.

1276
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:10,880
Just, maybe cut back
on the swashbuckling a bit?

1277
01:18:10,915 --> 01:18:13,817
I'll trade the swash
for the swish.

1278
01:18:13,852 --> 01:18:16,720
Sorry...
I couldn't resist.

1279
01:18:16,755 --> 01:18:18,840
It means
you're feeling better.

1280
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:23,160
I'm going to go
check on the others,

1281
01:18:23,195 --> 01:18:25,120
But I'll be back
soon, okay?

1282
01:18:25,155 --> 01:18:27,920
I'm not going anywhere.

1283
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,485
All right, gentlemen...
and lady...

1284
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:52,040
Let's fire this old gal up,
see where she'll take us.

1285
01:18:52,075 --> 01:18:53,520
That... Is
an excellent idea.

1286
01:18:53,555 --> 01:18:54,845
Who the hell are you?

1287
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:57,040
Burton.
His name is Burton.

1288
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:04,920
I don't believe
we've been introduced.

1289
01:19:04,955 --> 01:19:06,680
Captain sir
Richard Francis Burton.

1290
01:19:06,715 --> 01:19:07,720
My friends
call me "dick".

1291
01:19:07,755 --> 01:19:10,205
Burton, the explorer?

1292
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:11,845
Yeah, I read
one of your books.

1293
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:14,280
It was amateurish,
unnecessarily crude,

1294
01:19:14,315 --> 01:19:16,680
And pathetically
self-congratulatory.

1295
01:19:16,715 --> 01:19:18,325
Clemens, I'm confused.

1296
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:20,440
Are you talking about
my work or yours?

1297
01:19:21,995 --> 01:19:23,845
You again.

1298
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:25,920
You want to deal
with me, fine,

1299
01:19:25,955 --> 01:19:27,317
But, first,
let him go.

1300
01:19:27,352 --> 01:19:28,680
He has no part
in this.

1301
01:19:28,715 --> 01:19:30,360
Why, certainly.

1302
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:47,720
You see, Mr. Ellman,
I can be quite reasonable.

1303
01:19:47,755 --> 01:19:50,840
Now, Mr. Clemens, if
you'll set down your weapon

1304
01:19:50,875 --> 01:19:53,577
We can discuss the terms
of your surrender.

1305
01:19:53,612 --> 01:19:56,280
"Surrender" is not
in my vast vocabulary.

1306
01:19:56,315 --> 01:19:57,365
How about "bollocks"?

1307
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:59,080
Is that in your vast vocabulary?

1308
01:19:59,115 --> 01:20:00,205
Bollocks?

1309
01:20:01,815 --> 01:20:03,907
Ah! Son of a bitch!

1310
01:20:03,942 --> 01:20:06,000
Not... A good idea.

1311
01:20:06,035 --> 01:20:07,965
You, sir...

1312
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,520
Are a most despicable example

1313
01:20:09,555 --> 01:20:11,325
Of humankind.

1314
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:12,445
Why, thank you.
Mr. Ellman...

1315
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,160
I'm disappointed.
I saved your life once.

1316
01:20:14,195 --> 01:20:16,117
Where's the gratitude?

1317
01:20:16,152 --> 01:20:18,005
I'll send flowers.

1318
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:20,480
Roses, I find,
work for any occasion,

1319
01:20:20,515 --> 01:20:21,845
Although now
I've secured this ship,

1320
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:24,520
Keeping you alive doesn't
have the same urgency

1321
01:20:24,555 --> 01:20:26,040
That it once did.

1322
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:31,760
Jessie... Jessie?

1323
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:35,576
Jessie...

1324
01:20:35,611 --> 01:20:37,360
Jess...

1325
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:41,160
Jessie?

1326
01:20:41,195 --> 01:20:42,645
"Jessie."

1327
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:44,845
Yes, thank you
for reminding me.

1328
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:47,240
She... Gave me a
message to give to you.

1329
01:20:47,275 --> 01:20:48,720
Now, what was it?

1330
01:20:48,755 --> 01:20:49,965
You bastard.

1331
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,760
No, that wasn't it.

1332
01:20:51,795 --> 01:20:53,485
Now I remember.

1333
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,245
She said to tell you

1334
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:56,880
She was in love
with another man,

1335
01:20:56,915 --> 01:20:58,160
And to give you this...

1336
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:04,480
Matt!

1337
01:21:04,515 --> 01:21:05,680
Matthew!

1338
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:31,960
Sweep the ship for survivors!

1339
01:21:31,995 --> 01:21:33,457
Prepare to cast off.

1340
01:21:33,492 --> 01:21:34,885
Come on!

1341
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:38,560
This way.
Salut. I'm amelie.

1342
01:21:38,595 --> 01:21:41,485
Antonio.
Call me tony.

1343
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:43,920
Thanks for helping me out
back there.

1344
01:21:43,955 --> 01:21:45,720
Show me.

1345
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:48,205
Lovely.

1346
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:49,500
Quite lovely.

1347
01:21:49,535 --> 01:21:50,725
And you thought

1348
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:52,920
I never graduated
from soviet naval academy.

1349
01:21:59,220 --> 01:22:01,900
It should put on
quite a show.

1350
01:22:07,580 --> 01:22:09,620
Sorry, Sam.

1351
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:16,060
Matthew!

1352
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:36,860
<i>It was an accident...</i>

1353
01:22:36,895 --> 01:22:38,425
<i>It was an accident...
Okay? Okay?</i>

1354
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:40,420
<i>You can't keep beating
yourself up over it</i>

1355
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:42,265
<i>Your entire life.</i>

1356
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:43,540
<i>Yeah, that's
what everyone says...</i>

1357
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:45,505
<i>What everyone says...
What everyone says...</i>

1358
01:22:45,540 --> 01:22:48,060
<i>People need to see the truth.
People need to see the truth.</i>

1359
01:22:48,095 --> 01:22:49,260
<i>"forget it.
Put it behind you."</i>

1360
01:22:49,295 --> 01:22:50,785
<i>"put it behind you."</i>

1361
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:54,180
<i>You owe it to that little girl
to keep showing it to them...</i>

1362
01:22:54,215 --> 01:22:56,277
<i>Otherwise you're
wasting two lives...</i>

1363
01:22:56,312 --> 01:22:58,246
<i>Otherwise you're wasting
two lives.</i>

1364
01:22:58,281 --> 01:23:00,180
How come you know
all the answers?

1365
01:23:00,215 --> 01:23:01,380
You know all
the answers?

1366
01:23:01,415 --> 01:23:03,380
I'd better not lose you.

1367
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:29,980
To the end of the world.
