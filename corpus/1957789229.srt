1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,540
The following film is a dramatization

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:08,320
based on events in the life
of the Dilly family.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,060
Have you seen Linda?

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,860
No.
Have you seen Dr.

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,820
Smurf?
Prepping Dr.

6
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:26,040
Smurge.
She's pregnant, Doctor.

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,060
Pull the trigger.
Complications.

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,420
I need her on steroids by tonight.
She's on the way in.

9
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,040
Yeah.
So what happened?

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,020
Doctor Darwin says there's no
room for my cameraman in the or.

11
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:40,220
I'll catch up with you.

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,700
It's important, you know, to record it.
I'll see what I can do.

13
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,000
Not just for PR.
I know.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,500
To protect the hospital.
Don't worry.

15
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,960
Thanks, Doctor.
Smurst.

16
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,900
Nina, everything is happening so fast.

17
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,420
You're not holding anything back.
Hang on a second.

18
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,940
Ken.
Nobody's holding anything back.

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,740
Doris well, she'll have to put us on it.
We need it right away.

20
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,380
Yeah, I'll hold.

21
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,220
Look, I just can't talk right now.

22
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,540
But nobody will tell me.

23
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,130
I'm sorry, but I thought half a dozen

24
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,340
people left to cat down best
right before I called back.

25
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,020
You don't change over there
and somebody will tell you when to go.

26
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:12,980
Excuse me.
You're with the hospital, aren't you?

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,980
Yes.
The owner solid.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,020
Immediate relations.
You're Becky's mother, right?

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,900
You haven't heard anything new, have you?

30
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,540
About my daughter's condition?

31
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,700
I'm sure they tell you what they tell me.

32
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,100
I suppose you're right.

33
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,570
You don't need a spokesperson
or anything, do you?

34
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,340
Because I have kind of a knack.

35
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:30,660
I'll keep that in mind.

36
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,820
You're not supposed to be on this floor.

37
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:38,160
Why don't we just get out of their way
up here and we can talk downstairs?

38
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,980
My biggest concern is hemorrhage.

39
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,700
A pulmonary embolism could
kill her in seconds.

40
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,040
That's why I'm counting on you to stay

41
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,700
on top of her vital while
I do the procedure.

42
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:53,540
No problem, Mr.
Clash.

43
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,290
Shut up.
Well, time.

44
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,620
Everything's going
exactly as we planned it.

45
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,740
Planning is one thing.

46
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,020
I've never done anything
that's complicated before.

47
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,930
There are 30 doctors and nurses there.

48
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,800
Supporting you in a video clue shooting.

49
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,020
The entire thing will be
all over the news tonight.

50
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,140
You're going to be fine.

51
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,580
Just fine.

52
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:11,940
How about brilliant?

53
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:16,200
Brilliant is better starting now.

54
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,700
No.
She's in surgical prep.

55
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,300
We're going ahead.
Why?

56
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,220
What happened?
Is she okay?

57
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,170
Yeah, she's okay, but she needs you.

58
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,500
I'll bring you up to speed in a minute.

59
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,020
She's right in here.

60
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,320
Everything's going to be all right.

61
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,280
Guess what I'm going for.

62
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:11,440
It's just hard to believe after
anything we've been through.

63
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,980
It's not going to happen.

64
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:15,260
Yeah, hard to believe.

65
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,160
Nervous?

66
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,800
A little.

67
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,660
You're going to be there, right?

68
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,020
Oh, I don't faint.

69
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,680
No.

70
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,680
Worries.

71
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,780
The manager told me that you
could do some help.

72
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,660
Help?
Team.

73
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,260
I'm Becky Keith.

74
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,660
You know, I started today.

75
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,140
Well, party rooms are happening in duty,
especially for a trainee.

76
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:16,120
Well, no offense, but I don't think
I can do any worse than you are.

77
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,240
All right, we are going to play
Pin the Town on the donkey.

78
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,200
How's that sound?

79
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,820
I don't see why you can't
just wear your nursing shoes?

80
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,260
Because mine, they're pretty dorky
outside of a nursing school.

81
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,420
You think anybody at nashville is
going to notice what's on your feet?

82
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,300
Oh, daddy, look at those black flats.

83
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,620
Wouldn't they look cute on me?

84
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,280
Hey, you look cute no
matter what you wear.

85
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,540
Honey, men don't know
anything about shoes.

86
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:13,100
Why ask your you met someone, didn't you?

87
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:16,840
Maybe not at Nashes, I hope.
Yes, mother.

88
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,320
At Nashville's.
So what?

89
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,580
What kind of husband material can
you meet at a fast food place?

90
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,060
For your information, he was studying
computer science at the youth.

91
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,060
Was?

92
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:32,060
His mother has ms needed to take
time off to help her out?

93
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,180
Well, is he the manager, at least?

94
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:39,260
No, but I was bumping
gas when we first met.

95
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,580
Besides the point.

96
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,620
The point is he's a great guy.

97
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,900
He's bright, he's sweet, thoughtful.

98
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,580
He likes kids.

99
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,000
But don't worry, we are
a long way from the altar.

100
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,220
The honeymoon was supposed
to be after the wedding, mom.

101
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,780
Yeah, that was one of them where you were.

102
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,620
Everything else is still in the chapel.

103
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,180
We thought we'd get a head start
and want to keep folks waiting.

104
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,820
Well, that's very thoughtful of you,
baby, but you don't have to worry.

105
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,860
Well, dear, you need to worry
about fixing your lipstick.

106
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,480
Here.

107
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,980
Oh, good, you're all here.

108
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,220
Now, Michael,

109
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,820
should we start with the groove and then
do each family with a bride and groom?

110
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:24,540
Sounds good.

111
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,900
Yeah, we could get the dillies
on the left, the bride and groom.

112
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,580
And you can stay in your chair,
Lee, if it's easier.

113
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,280
Oh, thanks for the thought, Doris,

114
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,380
but I think I'd prefer to be standing for
the wedding picture, if you don't mind.

115
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:37,420
No, thank you, dear.

116
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,500
Now, straight in the camera.

117
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,960
Say bliss.
Bliss.

118
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,640
Bliss.

119
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,040
Mina, come on over here.
Come in the picture.

120
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,220
You the maid of honor.
Move back.

121
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,460
Okay, if you don't mind, let me take
the individual families first, please.

122
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,740
But we're all lined up.

123
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:59,220
Couldn't we just finish the group first?

124
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,260
Oh, no, go on, just shoot away.

125
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,000
Now, everybody smile.

126
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,780
Okay, that ought to do it.

127
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,380
Let's get the dilly plan.

128
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,420
Mr.

129
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,160
Dilly.

130
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,760
That's right.
All right.

131
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,420
Yeah, just a little bit closer.
There.

132
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,580
Oh, I love a cookie with just keith and I,
if that's all right with you.

133
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,580
Yeah, that would be a great idea.

134
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,200
I mean, who knows when we'll get
to see them in a text again, right?

135
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:56,920
Okay, we just made a baby.

136
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,720
I'm sure.

137
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,760
It doesn't mean we have stopped it.

138
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,180
I swear back.
This has been the best christmas ever.

139
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:23,300
Oh, well, it's not over yet.
What's this?

140
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:29,940
Open it's.

141
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,020
Beautiful.

142
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,020
I thought that we'd make it a tradition.

143
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,380
One special ornament each year.

144
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:38,780
Kind of like a gift
in advance for our kids.

145
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,900
Assuming we ever managed to have any.

146
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,100
Hasn't been that long.

147
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,220
Keith?
Yeah?

148
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,120
What if something's wrong?

149
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,820
It looks like you've both got
some problems with your plumbing.

150
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:59,220
You'd each have about a 20% chance of
getting pregnant with a normal partner.

151
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,600
I'm afraid together your
chances are less than 10%.

152
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,860
There must be something that we can do.

153
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,840
I could put you on Clomid.
What's?

154
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,340
Climate?
It's a fertility drug.

155
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:16,860
It stimulates production of the
hormone involved in ovulation.

156
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,700
It would bring your chances
up closer to normal.

157
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:20,860
Then let's do it.

158
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,060
Well, it's not cheap.

159
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,180
The treatment cycle
runs about 250 a month.

160
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,640
Fertility jokes aren't
covered by her insurance.

161
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,000
There's no way we can do it.
Becky.

162
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:45,480
We're maxed out on six
different credit cards.

163
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,100
Why don't we talk about it in the morning?

164
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,280
I can't get another bank loan.

165
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,940
I mean, we can't even make
our payments as it is.

166
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:55,180
Okay, well, just forget about it for now.
Forget about it?

167
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,180
How can I forget about it?

168
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,560
You're desperate to have a kid,
and I can't get you pregnant.

169
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,020
The hell?
I can't even pay to get you pregnant.

170
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,060
I'm desperate.
What about you?

171
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,260
You don't care about having
a family all of a sudden.

172
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,120
I care.

173
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,620
I don't know how we're going to do it.

174
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,640
And without kids,
I'm afraid you'll never be happy.

175
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,980
And if you're not happy, I'm afraid.

176
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:18,620
Ray, you might just pick up you.

177
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,260
Keith, I would never leave you.

178
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:25,520
No matter what the future holds for us,
I promise you we will face it together.

179
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,420
Good morning.

180
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,860
Hey.

181
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:04,640
You know, I could probably make manager
this year if I really put my mind to it.

182
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,460
What about going back to school?

183
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,780
I'll be time for that eventually.

184
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,860
If we cash in our life insurance and so

185
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:15,180
one of the cars, we should be able to get
you on this drug without going bankrupt.

186
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,260
Okay.

187
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:19,500
Don't do this because you
think this is what I want.

188
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,320
It's what I want too.

189
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,520
Are you sure?

190
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,240
Absolutely.

191
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,820
I think we did it.
There's no blue.

192
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,700
There back here.
Look.

193
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,220
There's a blue spot.
See?

194
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,540
Look at it in light.

195
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:55,120
Come back to bed.

196
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,880
I hate seeing you go through
this month after month.

197
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,660
What is it that really bothers you, Keith?
Is it the money?

198
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,360
No.

199
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,480
Yes.

200
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,580
We can't keep this up, Becky.
We just can't.

201
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:29,000
It's killing us.

202
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,820
Okay.

203
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:35,680
I'll stop taking that clumage.

204
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,320
Now.
You don't want to hear this,

205
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:48,880
but maybe we should
start looking into adoption.

206
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,040
Yeah, maybe we should.

207
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,740
I have to go off the clone
and we're going broke.

208
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:15,220
But back to my venture.

209
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,460
She hasn't done us any favors so far.

210
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,420
No reason to believe she'll start now.

211
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:23,260
You never know that the drug pressure,
thermometer in one hand,

212
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,460
the ovulation time in the other hand,
you might actually get pregnant.

213
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:29,540
Well, I believe sex might be fun again.
That'd be nice.

214
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:31,760
Yeah.
I don't know.

215
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,260
She's not we don't even talk anymore,

216
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:35,860
though when we do,
we always end up fighting.

217
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,420
She's going to baby so much,

218
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,620
but with the money and the disappointment
is just torn apart.

219
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:43,040
Do you have a few minutes after lunch?
Yeah.

220
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,300
I see.

221
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:46,100
It was a woman in postnadels,
just had twins.

222
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,540
I think I should meet her kids.

223
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,580
You are not going to believe
what happened this morning.

224
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,940
Nina introduced me to this couple.

225
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,460
They were trying to have kids for six
years and then they went

226
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:59,300
to the Indianapolis Fertility Clinic
and they had twins.

227
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,900
So what did she do?
In vitro implantation.

228
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,540
You know we can't afford no, I know that.

229
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,580
It isn't anything like that.

230
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:09,560
There's this great doctor there and he put
her on a new drug called Corpanage Works

231
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,880
where it stimulates this is a synthetic
version of the hormone itself and they're

232
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,540
getting incredible results
and they say it works really fast.

233
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:16,880
How much?

234
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,100
This woman got pregnant
the first month she took it.

235
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:22,060
What?
We were going to apply for adoption.

236
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,260
Do you remember that conversation?

237
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:27,340
We would be on a waiting list
for years without any guarantees.

238
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,020
Does this new drug come with a guarantee?

239
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,700
No, of course not.

240
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:35,240
But shouldn't we at least check it out?

241
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,040
Something tells me we're
not in Kansas anymore.

242
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:50,920
Back,
there's a common misconception

243
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:55,180
that fertility treatments usually
result in multiple births.

244
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:57,480
However, the fact is that three out

245
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:01,660
of four women who are successful
with Perganol end up with only one baby.

246
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:06,100
And of the 25% that result in multiple
births, almost all of them are twins.

247
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,940
Higher, multiples, even triplets,
are really very rare.

248
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:11,860
We would have no problem with twins.

249
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,220
Well, that's good.

250
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,620
But despite what I just said, you still
have to be prepared for any outcome.

251
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:20,300
We want a family doctor with laughlin,
instant or otherwise.

252
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:23,700
Well, then I'd say that pergnol
is your best option.

253
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,580
And how much does this drug cost exactly?

254
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:29,800
It's about 1000 per cycle.

255
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,860
So how's that holding up?

256
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:43,260
He's angry.
So am I.

257
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,540
Well, I can't blame you.

258
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:48,900
What kind of university just up
and closes its food service department?

259
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:51,420
And what is your dad supposed to do now?

260
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,820
Who's going to hire a man his age?

261
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,860
Well, you have savings.

262
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:00,840
Yeah, it won't last forever.

263
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,700
Your father wants to move
back upstate to Burn.

264
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:08,540
Why?
Your Uncle Albert offered him a job.

265
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,780
Frankly, I'd rather starve.

266
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:13,300
Hey, what are you doing out there?

267
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,140
Oh, we're building the birdhouse.

268
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,380
The third one this week.

269
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,680
Supposed to be a rough winter.

270
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,500
Your mother said you wanted
to talk to us about something.

271
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:26,460
Oh, yeah.

272
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:31,440
There was this new treatment nevermind.

273
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,360
It's not important.

274
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,860
Great.
Except I made too much.

275
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:50,940
But I could always freeze
and take it over to your mom.

276
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:55,500
She wouldn't need it because I made it.
Becky.

277
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:58,260
Well, I can't get her to say
two words to me, Keith.

278
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,500
She's like that with everyone.
I'm not everyone.

279
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,140
I'm her daughter in law.

280
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:03,180
But you know what?

281
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:06,200
I'm not going to let your
mother ruin this dinner.

282
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,740
More wine?

283
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,770
You try to apply me with alcohol?
Absolutely.

284
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,290
Drunk can take advantage.

285
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,200
He bet.

286
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,560
I'm a little surprised for you.

287
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,220
Did I forget our anniversary or something?

288
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:28,320
No, you didn't forget anything.

289
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:33,480
This is one cycle's worth of curbinol,
one last roll of the dice keys.

290
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,440
If it doesn't work, it's over.
I swear.

291
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,240
How'd you pay for that?

292
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,740
I pawn my wedding ring.

293
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:45,900
You pawned your wedding ring
without telling me?

294
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,770
Why?
Would you let me if I had?

295
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,570
No, I don't know.

296
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,660
That's not the point.
What is?

297
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:53,860
That ring was a symbol of our commitment.

298
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,530
I know that, Keith.

299
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,420
But you were willing to sell it.

300
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:00,860
Having a child is part
of my commitment to you.

301
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,800
To us.

302
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,050
Keith, it is what I have always dreamed
of, and I can't just give it up.

303
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,640
Not without a fight.

304
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,080
Come on, you can understand
that, can't you?

305
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,880
I guess so, yeah.

306
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:28,140
But don't you ever
Dorisk me like that, okay?

307
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:32,140
I promise you, I will never,
ever Doris you like that again.

308
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,570
So where were we?

309
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,050
Wait.

310
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,840
First.

311
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,980
Your HCG levels are above 7000.

312
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:52,840
Normal is 100.

313
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,660
I'm pregnant.

314
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,840
Congratulations.

315
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,050
And with hormone levels that high, I'd
say we're talking about more than one.

316
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,280
Oh, did you hear that?

317
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,050
Care for a little more
of my onion pie, Larry?

318
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,180
Thank you, Doris.
It was delicious.

319
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,500
But I could eat another bite.

320
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,900
I'd like another piece to you.

321
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,980
You haven't touched yours.

322
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:17,920
Lee Can I fix you something else?
Oh, no.

323
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,500
Everything looks really delicious to us.

324
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,220
I'm not very hungry.

325
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,010
You're not allergic to anything, are you?

326
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,460
Key should have told me.

327
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:26,860
It has nothing to do
with your cooking, mom.

328
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,460
Of course it doesn't have
anything to do with my cooking.

329
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:32,140
He hasn't been feeling very well.

330
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,530
No, I feel just fine.
I really do.

331
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,460
I think I'll go out
in the porch and have a smoke.

332
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,180
Mom, can you wait just a minute?

333
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,960
Why?

334
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:45,720
Becky has something to tell you
to tell everybody.

335
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,980
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

336
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:51,160
You're pregnant.

337
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,530
We wanted to wait for Thanksgiving because

338
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,220
we do have news that we
are truly thankful for.

339
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,700
Yes, mother, I'm pregnant.

340
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,160
And it's probably twins.

341
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,290
Becky, do you recall the conversation
we had about multiple births?

342
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,090
How one and four women on pergnolized.

343
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,290
Yeah, don't worry,
we have no problem with twins.

344
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,810
I mean, we have been trying for so long.

345
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,660
Twins will be just fine.

346
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,400
Heck, we want twins.

347
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,240
Triplets would be great too.

348
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,560
I'm really glad to hear
you say that, Vicky.

349
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,280
Let me give her sit down.
Oh God.

350
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,660
You're not pregnant.

351
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,680
Oh no, I'm pregnant.

352
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,770
There's something wrong with the baby?

353
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,740
No, the baby's fine.

354
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:12,740
All the babies are fine.

355
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:17,200
All eyes.

356
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,460
As you know, I thought that three
of your five eggs weren't even viable.

357
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,180
But all five are fertilized.

358
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,500
Yes, it's a miracle.

359
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,860
Well, I've never seen anything like it,
but in all my years of practice.

360
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:39,180
But there is a downside.

361
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:43,570
The human body simply isn't designed
to carry that many children.

362
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,660
Now, an ideal outcome in a high multiple
pregnancy like yours would be twins.

363
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,420
Triplets at most.

364
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,620
What are you saying?

365
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,400
That there are health risks involved

366
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:57,780
in carrying multiples health risks
to back here, the babies both.

367
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:03,160
Now it's my responsibility to make sure
that you make an informed decision.

368
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,780
Are you suggesting the procedure
is called a selective reduction?

369
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:08,660
It has to be done by the 9th week so

370
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:13,020
that the nonviable fetuses will be
reabsorbed abortion of the babies?

371
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:18,500
Yes, and there are serious risks
to that procedure as well.

372
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,460
In many cases, a selective reduction
becomes a full termination.

373
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,090
Forget about a factor.
We have heard enough about termination.

374
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:24,780
Right?

375
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,860
We have waited almost five
years to get to this day.

376
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,740
We have done everything within our means,

377
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:32,900
including risking our
marriage to get this far.

378
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,740
I have heard all of their hearts beating.

379
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,620
They are all my children.

380
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:40,080
Selective reduction is not an option.

381
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,640
Okay.

382
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:49,480
In that case, it becomes my job to see
that this pregnancy is safely managed.

383
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:58,780
No more movies, tapes,
books, magazines, music, computer stuff.

384
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,330
None.
You are serious?

385
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,380
No more eating out.
Start shopping, bulk.

386
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:06,220
No new clothes ever more
gifts to each other.

387
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:09,400
Except maybe this last one.

388
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,840
You are such romantic.

389
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,020
We're going to make it work somehow.

390
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,260
I know we will.

391
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,740
If I have to, I can go back to work.

392
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:27,920
Well, let's hope you don't have to,
because I ain't facing that mountain.

393
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,920
Oh, Lauren, did you tell Keith yet?

394
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,290
Lauren has already asked his brother

395
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,180
Albert, and there is a job
waiting for both of you and Burn.

396
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,140
I have a job.

397
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,500
And with the money,
we'd say by living together

398
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:50,330
in the country, becky and I will be
able to stay home with the babies.

399
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,020
We appreciate your concern, Doris,

400
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:55,860
but we were sort of planning
on raising our children on our own.

401
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:57,940
Five babies, Keith.

402
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,140
Five?

403
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:01,260
You just don't have any idea.

404
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,740
When's the last time you had five babies?
Doors.

405
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,660
Oh, no.
Don't be so touchy, Keith.

406
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:08,090
I'm just worried about my grandchildren.

407
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:11,240
He knows, Mum.
We've worked it out.

408
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:14,090
So the last penny won't manage.

409
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:20,000
Oh, when you finally come to your senses,
there'll be a big house waiting for you.

410
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,420
What?
What is it?

411
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,860
Look.
Stretch mark.

412
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:38,140
Geez, just get the hell out of me.

413
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:40,740
What?
How long has it been?

414
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,660
Ten weeks?
Eleven weeks?

415
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,050
Two days.

416
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,700
Wow.

417
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:48,840
You look like you can deliver any minute.

418
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,160
At this rate, you're
going to be full term.

419
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,380
Wait.
In two weeks time?

420
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:53,500
Is that a problem?

421
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:54,620
It could be.

422
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:58,680
The uterus will try to deliver,
so we're going to have to do a surplus if

423
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,860
we're going to have any hope
of gaining a viable birth weight.

424
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,460
A what?

425
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,940
We put a stitch around
the cervix like a belt.

426
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,940
It helps to prevent premature labor

427
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,330
because once a cervix dilates,
it's too late for drugs.

428
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,900
I could hurt my babies.

429
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,440
There's always an element of risk

430
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:14,540
with surgery, especially when
you're carrying five fetuses.

431
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:17,860
And without it, they'd be
too premature to survive.

432
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:20,050
That's a good probability.

433
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,720
Then let's do it.

434
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,090
Hello, dad.

435
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,920
What's up?

436
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,520
I leave.
Diligent, please.

437
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,240
Just up the stairs.

438
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,900
You get the results of your tests?

439
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,900
Oh, no.

440
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,980
You know those doctors.

441
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:08,660
They never tell you anything.

442
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:12,220
At least, did they say it was definitely
cancer or is there a chance the Ms?

443
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,840
No.
They always tell you something different.

444
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,050
I had a real nice dream last night.

445
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,800
Yeah?

446
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,380
I dreamt that I saw all my grandchildren.

447
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:30,290
I dreamt that I held them all.

448
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,320
I dreamt that I held all five of them.

449
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,640
I'll tell you something.

450
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,140
I'm going to make that dream come true.

451
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:42,560
I really am.

452
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,240
I promise you that.

453
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,240
I don't believe this.

454
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,570
Mom might have lung cancer
and he starts smoking again.

455
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,680
Keith, not might.

456
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,720
She has lung cancer.

457
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,050
She sleep.

458
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,840
Yeah.

459
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,560
You can get through this.

460
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,320
Don't worry about me.

461
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,780
You're going to combine
somewhere before you go.

462
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:31,000
Yeah, I'll be coming by.

463
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,570
You want to grab a cup
of coffee or something?

464
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:46,600
No, I better get up there.

465
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,380
Dr.
McLaughlin said you're doing great, sir.

466
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:12,290
Clause is working the way
it's supposed to.

467
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,280
Your mom will worry about.

468
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,600
She says she will.

469
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,220
You're about to enter your second

470
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:43,380
trimester, and that's where I take
over for Doctor Mclaughlawson.

471
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:44,620
You're holding up well,

472
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:47,680
and all indications are good,
despite the weight gain.

473
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,020
Well, she's just going to go
on gaining five or £6 a day.

474
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:53,180
Try seven.
She looks like a blue spot ready to pop.

475
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:58,660
Well, we can stabilize food retention,
but you have to work with me.

476
00:28:58,690 --> 00:28:59,420
We're a team.

477
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:04,140
Now, I'll give you simple, direct orders,
which I expect you to follow.

478
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:10,020
Keith, your job is to help Becky any way
that you can, and here's my first order.

479
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:13,160
You have to stop working immediately.

480
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,460
We really need the money.

481
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,020
We plan on working for at least
the next three months.

482
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:22,020
I'm sorry, but from now on,
you're on modified home address.

483
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:23,780
You can go out briefly.

484
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:25,140
No more than 20 minutes.

485
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:29,980
On your feet, Spencer.

486
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:33,280
Sounds like a soap actor.

487
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,320
Dakota.

488
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,090
Hippie dippy.

489
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,220
Dakota Dilly.

490
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,540
Bronwyn.

491
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:43,620
Over my dead body.

492
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,880
Bronwyn.

493
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,330
No.
Something's not right.

494
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,570
Keith, you okay?

495
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,240
No.

496
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,700
Becky's uterus is so stretched
that it can't make contractions.

497
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:04,460
What felt like cramps to her was
the beginning of premature labor.

498
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:05,980
Is she going to be okay?

499
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,460
We're trying to bring the labor under

500
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:10,570
control with high doses
of magnesium sulfate.

501
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,290
I need you to sign a consent

502
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,540
for an emergency cesarean
in case we can't stop the labor.

503
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:19,330
What would happen to the
babies if you did that?

504
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,900
Well, we're not quite 24 weeks.

505
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:23,570
They weigh about a pound each.

506
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,960
They have no lung function right now.

507
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,810
They have no chance.

508
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,180
How far does she have to go?

509
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:33,570
How long is she lung
function begins at 26 weeks.

510
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,290
That point, they would have a 60% to 70%
chance of survival,

511
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:43,360
but they would still likely face
severe long term disabilities.

512
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,140
I'm going to make you,
Keith, and so our children.

513
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:50,460
I'm going to get these babies to 26 weeks.

514
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:52,860
I'm going to get them past 26 weeks.

515
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,380
You just don't sign any forms.

516
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:55,570
Do you hear me?

517
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,280
Don't sign any forms.

518
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,700
And if you don't do the cesarean.

519
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:07,660
If we can't stop labor,
we have to do the cesarean.

520
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:10,400
We lose Becky.

521
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,220
When they say you've got a bun in the
oven, they're certainly not kidding.

522
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,740
I have never been so hot in my whole life.

523
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:29,050
Well, at least the uterus is quiet down.

524
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,700
Try and get some rest, okay, Becky?

525
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:33,040
I'll do my best.

526
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,810
Hello?

527
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,260
Hi, Becky.

528
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:45,140
Becky, it's Lee.
Lee, hi.

529
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,140
How are you doing?

530
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:49,810
They tell me the worst is over,
but I sent Keith home.

531
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,980
Are you okay?
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

532
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:55,180
I thought you might still be awake.

533
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,240
Yeah, well, you thought right.

534
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:58,700
I feel like I'm about
to spontaneously combust.

535
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:00,960
Oh, man.

536
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,900
I remember there was a lot of stuff that I
didn't want to talk to Larry about,

537
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:08,420
and I really couldn't talk
to my mother about it or anybody.

538
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:13,540
So if you feel that way and you never want
to talk to me, you just pick up the phone

539
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,330
and you call me anytime
you want to, all right?

540
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,540
Day or night.

541
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:18,540
You may be sorry you offered.

542
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:21,680
No, I won't know.

543
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,860
And, Becky, I just wanted
to tell you something.

544
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:32,400
Know what you want and really stick to it.

545
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,980
Everything's going to turn out all right.

546
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:37,560
You just know it.

547
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,140
That's what God wants to see.

548
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:43,040
Courage.

549
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:49,640
Becky, you cry.

550
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,540
I'm so glad you called.

551
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:58,320
Well, I wish I'd done it sooner.

552
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,500
I love you, you know.

553
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:04,420
Like a daughter.

554
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:07,640
I love you, too, baby.

555
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,220
I just talked to Dr.
Smurst.

556
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,940
It's official.
You're stabilized.

557
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:19,330
Oh, thank God.
That's the good news.

558
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,140
The bad news is she wants to keep
you in the hospital until delivery.

559
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,540
That could be a couple of months.

560
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:25,780
Let's hope so.

561
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:27,900
Longer the better, right?

562
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:29,700
I won't be able to visit your mom.

563
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:31,380
Oh, sure you will.

564
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,880
With her babies.

565
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,980
I don't know when I'll be getting back,

566
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:42,700
Lauren, but it would be awful nice
to see the nursery painted when I do.

567
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:45,380
I want to start moving
things in on the weekend.

568
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,940
Heaven said they're moving out here.

569
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:48,290
Oh, they will.

570
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,640
Too colds.

571
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,570
And here I thought you were going

572
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,330
in for something routine,
maybe staying overnight.

573
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,560
And it turns out you're going to be
in here until you give birth.

574
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:04,740
I'll have to be driving back and forth
between Burn and Indianapolis for weeks.

575
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:07,220
You know how I hate driving.

576
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,300
This is really going to take a toll on me.

577
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:12,210
I've already started smoking again.

578
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,900
I'm sorry to be such
an inconvenience mother.

579
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:18,260
Oh, honey, that's not what I meant.

580
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:23,340
I'm just scared about what could happen.

581
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:28,440
It gives me the heebie jeebies
just thinking about it.

582
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,000
Have a little courage.

583
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,880
Sure.
Firefighter cure for the Heebe jaybees.

584
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,210
Interesting clone case.
What's it called?

585
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:52,640
Odor rose pork with noodles is my guess.

586
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,170
Pardon me.

587
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,820
I live for your vicinity.

588
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:02,400
I hear the heartbeats.

589
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,380
What do you think of the name Brenna?

590
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:07,170
Brenna.

591
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,130
I like it.

592
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,260
I'm going to put on the draws list.
Cute.

593
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:13,210
I'm kiss it's hard.
It's a rock.

594
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,080
I know.

595
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,400
Oh, my God.

596
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,170
What is it, Keith?
Right there.

597
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,980
Right there.
She's developed some kind of mess.

598
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:29,380
Honey, that's no mess.

599
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:31,720
That's a butt.

600
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,500
No more for you.
Hello?

601
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:38,100
Hi, Becky.
It's Lee.

602
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,100
Hi, Lee.
How are you doing tonight?

603
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,100
Good.
He's just here.

604
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:42,940
I'm using the nurses.
Hold on 1 second.

605
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,060
He wants to talk to you.

606
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:46,380
Mom, do you want to hear him?

607
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:47,420
The babies?

608
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:49,760
They're little hearts.

609
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,080
I can hear them.

610
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:12,380
Starting tomorrow, we'll do procedural run
throughs twice daily until everyone

611
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:16,100
on the team is able to handle
any possible contingency.

612
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:21,980
I want any surprises on DDay,
or should I say B for birthday?

613
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:25,340
Anyway, we all know what Becky has gone
through to get here,

614
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:30,540
and I'm determined that she's going
to hold five healthy babies in her arms.

615
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:35,020
Now, from this time forward,
no one on the team is to leave town.

616
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:36,500
You'll all be in 24 hours.

617
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:39,580
Deeper contact, no more than
30 minutes from the hospital.

618
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:43,540
And with any luck, that's how we all
live for at least a couple more weeks.

619
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:49,380
Every day, every hour buys us better
intestines, better brain, better lungs.

620
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:55,020
Now that you safely made it to 28 weeks,
we're going into red alert mode.

621
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:56,000
Knees.
Funny.

622
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,580
I'm delivering those babies.

623
00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:00,100
What's the record for Queen?
32 weeks.

624
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:02,460
Five days.
I can do that.

625
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:05,340
Just do me a favor and make
it to Indy Day, okay?

626
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,580
I never missed the five.
You're doing it right.

627
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:09,380
Don't worry.
I got a medical test.

628
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:13,540
Take my bike into the stadium,
my beaver goes off, and I'm out of there.

629
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,740
I can make it to my Corvette
in three and a half minutes.

630
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:19,300
Once I'm in my car, I can make it
to the hospital in 14 minutes flat.

631
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:21,340
18 minutes total.
That's amazing.

632
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:24,260
Have you actually timed it twice?

633
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:28,060
Listen, once damn breaks,
things are going to get pretty hectic.

634
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,960
Is there anything that isn't clear to you

635
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:33,780
about what to expect or anything
that you're worried about?

636
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:36,020
There is just one thing.

637
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:40,580
I don't know if this makes any sense
to you, but they're already my children.

638
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,200
I'm their mother, and I love them all.

639
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:44,780
And I have to protect
them any way that I can.

640
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:48,780
So as far as I'm concerned,
my babies come first.

641
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,340
We will let you down, Becky.

642
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:52,130
You're in good hands.

643
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,650
But we're all in God's hands now.

644
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,980
Despite our best preparations,
we can't guarantee the outcome.

645
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:00,260
In the event of an emergency,
you come first.

646
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:03,500
That's my duty as your doctor.

647
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:09,720
But I promise you, we will do everything
humanly possible for your babies.

648
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,600
Hi, Mrs.
Stauffer.

649
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,170
Surprise.

650
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,760
I had to come to town to do some shopping.

651
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,800
Oh, my God.

652
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:34,600
Somebody helped my daughter
having a stroke.

653
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,740
Hey.

654
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:48,260
Your motherinlaw thought that Becky had
had a stroke, but I've explained to her

655
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:52,260
and Becky that she's developed
a condition called Bell's palsy.

656
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:56,540
Sheer mass of babies and fluids
is pinched off a facial nerve.

657
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,130
Now, we can usually reverse
that with a high dose of steroids,

658
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:03,540
but I can't give them to Becky until she's
safely delivered and been stabilized.

659
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:06,500
And that's why beepers went
off all over Indianapolis.

660
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:09,500
This one Keith needs is waiting outside.

661
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:19,340
She's going to help you get down,
and we'll see in the ready?

662
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:21,380
Become a daddy never more.

663
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:22,540
Ready.

664
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:24,800
I love you.

665
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,540
All right, getting ready for the uterine.

666
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:28,580
Everybody ready?

667
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:30,400
Scissors.

668
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,500
It looks clear.

669
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:36,160
Clean sponges, please.

670
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,920
Here comes baby.

671
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,600
Here we go.

672
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,210
Congratulations, people.

673
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,960
We just delivered five beautiful babies.

674
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,840
I think we got a problem.

675
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,520
Everything was going fine.
What went wrong?

676
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,480
What have you got?
I don't know.

677
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:32,060
I can't tell what I'm feeling.
Oh, my God.

678
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,690
What?
I think there's another baby.

679
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,380
In here.
Linda, don't get around.

680
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:42,020
I'm not kidding around.
I got to put my breach baby.

681
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:44,520
I've been with her.

682
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,500
How's that?
Fine.

683
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:58,460
Well, how about the baby?

684
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:00,130
Only there are five.

685
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,580
One was hiding.

686
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:03,500
We have six healthy babies.

687
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:07,480
Four boys and two girls.

688
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,780
Congratulations.
Yeah, it was nice.

689
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,540
And Dr.
Smurs to include me.

690
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,160
Five.
You think I let Becky help?

691
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:42,140
As much fun alone are the muskets.

692
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,620
Well, they need a little help with their

693
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:46,700
breathing, but that's pretty
much the norm is 31 weeks.

694
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:48,700
BBG is having a little more trouble

695
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:54,520
with lung function, but we're hopeful
he'll catch up to the other soon.

696
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,920
Becky.

697
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,740
Good evening.
I'm Dr.

698
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:35,780
SMRs, and this is Dr.
McLaughlin.

699
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:39,980
And we delivered the sex tablets
in a span of three minutes at 05:00 p.m..

700
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,460
This afternoon.

701
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:44,780
At this time, they are in good
health and in stable conditions.

702
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:46,300
Who are the parents?

703
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,860
They're being kept anonymous for now.

704
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,940
They have enough to deal
with at this moment.

705
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:55,980
How do you feel about having delivered
America's first surviving sex public?

706
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:59,100
What was your reaction to finding
there was a Stowaway baby?

707
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:00,540
Surprise.

708
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:01,900
How'd you miss it?

709
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,700
Was there at least two dozen ultrasounds
during the course of the pregnancy?

710
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:06,640
Let me see.

711
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,980
You have to understand what sort
of information you get from ultrasound.

712
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:13,420
It's a two dimensional view
of a three dimensional situation.

713
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:16,260
Now, at the beginning,
we didn't see a six egg.

714
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:18,860
From then on, we simply
stopped counting after five.

715
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,500
If you knew there were five eggs,
why did you go ahead?

716
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:23,340
Did you want her to have quintuplix?

717
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,020
Three of the eggs didn't
appear to be viable.

718
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:27,580
We were expecting two
fertilizations at the most.

719
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:30,140
For all five eggs to be fertilized six,

720
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:32,760
as it turned out,
is an extremely rare occurrence.

721
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:33,860
It almost never happens.

722
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:36,620
Doesn't the AMA advise
reducing multiple pregnancies?

723
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,740
Yes.
How come you didn't?

724
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:42,560
Were you thinking of your own
reputation rather than your patient?

725
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,620
Every patient is unique.

726
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,460
We were guided in this particular case

727
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:54,060
by the parents long and difficult
struggle to have a family.

728
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:57,180
That's all the time we have for questions.

729
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,380
Doctor McLaughlin and Dr.

730
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,580
Submers need to get back
to their patients now.

731
00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:03,320
Thank you.
Just one moment.

732
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,000
Okay, turn them over.

733
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,200
Quinnie.

734
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:33,360
Adrian, julian.

735
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,040
What do you think?

736
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,360
Perfect.

737
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,200
Every one of them.

738
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,900
Six babies.

739
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,210
Six?

740
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,740
How are we going to do this?

741
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:52,780
As well as we possibly can.

742
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:57,140
We stretched every penny like it was
wherever that was for five minutes.

743
00:46:57,170 --> 00:47:01,880
The incremental cost per unit
doesn't go up that much.

744
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:06,210
We could always move
in with my folks, I suppose.

745
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,380
Let's don't worry about that now, okay?

746
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:13,180
Let's just concentrate on getting you
and the babies out of the hospital.

747
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:21,860
Why can't we tell them
that your mom could see the babies?

748
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:23,740
You know what?

749
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:26,900
Why don't you take these
over to her right now?

750
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,260
Oh, I should stay with you.

751
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:30,180
No, you shouldn't.
You should get out of here.

752
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:32,760
You're keeping me alike

753
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,500
oh, they are magnets.

754
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:53,780
Is it in good shape?

755
00:47:53,810 --> 00:47:54,860
Except for Julian.

756
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:57,100
He's drilling a low.
Oh, he's going to be.

757
00:47:57,130 --> 00:47:58,780
Just fine.

758
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:00,780
He reminds me of you, you know.

759
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:04,060
He looks a little bit like you.

760
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:06,060
I can't wait to see him.

761
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:08,780
I can't wait to see all of them.

762
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:12,880
It might be a while
before they're released.

763
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,100
Yeah.
What do you mean, a while?

764
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:17,060
A couple of months.

765
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:18,620
Julie Maybe longer.

766
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:21,620
Well, I'm going to hold all of you.

767
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:25,160
Especially you, little guy.

768
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,780
How are you doing?
Are you okay?

769
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:30,100
Yeah, I guess.

770
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:34,280
I'm a little worried about how
I'm going to cope with all this.

771
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,300
You're going to cope fine.

772
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,560
Just relax.

773
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:45,440
You know what I used to do with you
when you were a little what?

774
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:48,480
Well, to calm you down and to make you

775
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:53,980
breathe easier, I used to sit by your crib
and I used to massage it with my finger.

776
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:55,060
Just a finger.

777
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:57,260
It was bigger than your arm.

778
00:48:57,290 --> 00:49:02,760
Just hour after hour, day after day.

779
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,620
What these babies need more
than anything else's love.

780
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:10,900
When you and Becky have
plenty of that to give them.

781
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:15,380
So as long as they're fats, they're.

782
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,880
Going to be just fine.

783
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,260
Thank you.

784
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:29,360
Thank you so much for watching over me.

785
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:43,480
I'm Arlene.
I'm Brennan.

786
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,740
I'm Jackie.
I'm looking after quit.

787
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:49,680
Thank you.

788
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,720
I'm Tony.
I'm Ian.

789
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:13,000
I'm sorry, I can't open
Julian vice for you.

790
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,500
Grab a car.

791
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,260
Look, we figured out what's stressing

792
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,580
Julian he's developed in hernia,
which is adding.

793
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:33,860
To his breathing problem.

794
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:37,620
So I've rigged up a little trust for him,
which should help to eat his pain.

795
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:39,940
So what do you do about the hernia?

796
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:43,260
We repair it surgically,
which is fairly routine.

797
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,820
The problem with Julian is that we.

798
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:46,620
Can'T do it until he's stronger.

799
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,760
In the meantime, because of his stress
breathing, we've got to keep him on.

800
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:54,580
Oxygen, and that presents a serious risk
of long term neurological complications.

801
00:50:54,610 --> 00:50:58,720
I'm afraid it's a race against time.

802
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:22,440
I knew you two would come
to your senses eventually.

803
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,780
How did you pay for all those stores?

804
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:30,980
People have been so kind, dropping off
blankets, diapers and sleepers and toys.

805
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,180
I don't know what all.
I've lost track.

806
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:35,980
And Lauren's cousin is
at the furniture factory.

807
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:38,500
He got us the deal on these cribs.

808
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:40,980
Oh, mom, this is so incredible.

809
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:44,340
But what about Julian's crib
and his little name plate?

810
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:48,460
The name plate is right here,
but the crib is in the garage.

811
00:51:48,490 --> 00:51:53,210
I thought you wouldn't want
to set it up yet, just in case.

812
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:56,100
No, I do want to set it up.

813
00:51:56,130 --> 00:52:00,600
We have six children,
and they'll all be coming home.

814
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:05,280
Here, honey, put this with it.

815
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:15,740
Brother Albert bought this place from a
food service outfit that went belly up.

816
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:19,420
Bought cabbage direct from his neighbor,
planted an acre of carrot.

817
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:23,900
Now he supplyed coleslaw for nearer
damn restaurant in Lancaster county.

818
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,260
So what am I going to be doing?

819
00:52:25,290 --> 00:52:28,540
Well, I'll be out making sales
calls and deliveries mainly.

820
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:34,380
And you'll be hearing headquarters
mostly hacking cabbage.

821
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:36,300
Well, look on the bright side.

822
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,700
At least that's 10 hours a day.

823
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:41,080
You won't be taking orders from Doris.

824
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,360
I think I found the perfect job.

825
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,620
How do you feel about going home
with five of your babies and not the six?

826
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:54,180
Well, it's wonderful to be going
home with five of our children.

827
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:56,380
It's a miracle and I'm grateful.

828
00:52:56,410 --> 00:52:59,780
But our family won't be complete
until Julian is home too.

829
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:03,540
Can you afford to raise six kids?

830
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,340
Well, maybe they won't have every material

831
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:09,100
advantage, but they will have
five siblings and lots of love.

832
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,980
Are you expecting assistance
from the government?

833
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:15,280
And do you think that's fair
just because you had six babies?

834
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,900
That never even occurred to us.
Really?

835
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,820
We want to be a family just like any other

836
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,820
family and look after
our children ourselves.

837
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:22,680
Julian very ill.

838
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:24,340
Do you still think you
did the right thing?

839
00:53:24,370 --> 00:53:25,900
We left it in God's hands.

840
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:29,440
But you did take fertility drugs.

841
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,400
I don't want to get political.

842
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:35,660
I don't think that everybody should just
have sex tablets because it's so much fun.

843
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:37,940
This is how it happened for us.

844
00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:40,620
We're just ordinary people with a big job.

845
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:47,380
Actually, we did want six babies,
just not all at once.

846
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:50,420
Keith, what is it that you're
worried about most?

847
00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:52,140
An IRS audit.

848
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,580
Last year we had two deductions.

849
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:55,700
Next year we'll have eight.

850
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:57,100
Can we get a picture of you.

851
00:53:57,130 --> 00:53:59,360
Both with the babies?

852
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,980
No, I'm sorry.

853
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:03,780
No pictures.
Not yet.

854
00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:06,120
Not without Julian.

855
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,620
It's okay.
It's not much longer.

856
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:44,480
We'll all be together at last.

857
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,780
All right?
You are looking so much better than me.

858
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:07,460
Oh, I can't remember
the last time I was happy.

859
00:55:07,490 --> 00:55:08,780
Don't be afraid, Larry.

860
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:09,900
You're not going to break.

861
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:12,210
I was never around kids much.

862
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:16,960
I was always on the road
when Keith was going up.

863
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,300
I think I can change his diaper.

864
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:20,880
I think I remember how.

865
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:23,860
You are behaving.

866
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:26,460
He's going to be a real lady killer.
Thank you, we're.

867
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:31,580
You're so demanding.

868
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:33,140
Yes, you are.

869
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:35,660
And you're just so lovable.

870
00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:37,920
You're just so low.

871
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,820
Look at that.
Brenda.

872
00:55:39,850 --> 00:55:41,900
Unflappable.

873
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:43,180
Oh, really?

874
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:48,340
And you, Adrian, you are
going to be an athlete.

875
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:50,820
How do you know all that?
CC.

876
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:53,240
I'm your grandma.

877
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:00,960
Oh.
I wasn't sleeping.

878
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:03,380
I was just resting my eyes.

879
00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:05,420
I'll take over for a while.

880
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:08,300
Oh, I've got this under control.

881
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:11,860
It'd be a much better help if you went
down and made some breakfast bottles.

882
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:12,960
I like to be with the babies.

883
00:57:12,990 --> 00:57:14,100
Before I go to work.

884
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:15,460
Oh, but the bottles.

885
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:17,780
I'll get to them.

886
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:19,560
Fine.

887
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:27,020
Julian Pernia is nearly as big as

888
00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:30,140
a baseball now, but they
still can't operate.

889
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,820
They managed to keep a trust on him,

890
00:57:31,850 --> 00:57:37,640
but he doesn't like it and it
makes them fucking okay.

891
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,100
It's getting stronger.
Dr.

892
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:44,100
Braxton is hoping to take them
off the ventilator fairly soon.

893
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:47,480
Then you can hold them
until your heart is content.

894
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,060
A baby could be picked up when he tried.

895
00:57:55,090 --> 00:58:21,800
Hi, Sheri.

896
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,860
Would you like some coffee or something?

897
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:34,540
Tea would be nice.

898
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:35,940
I'll make up a pun.

899
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:38,580
Oh, thank you, Larry.

900
00:58:38,610 --> 00:58:40,900
I appreciate you coming by.

901
00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:43,880
Like you said, it was important.

902
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:48,860
Those babies are running
off your feet, huh?

903
00:58:48,890 --> 00:58:51,140
Oh, Lord.
They're making me a nervous wreck.

904
00:58:51,170 --> 00:58:54,100
Well, they're running us all racket.

905
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:56,380
Well, I know you're pretty busy,

906
00:58:56,410 --> 00:59:01,540
so I guess I better get
right to the point, dear.

907
00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:02,840
Doris, it's okay, don't.

908
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:05,620
There's nothing to be scared about.

909
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:09,400
I just want to ask you do me a favor.

910
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:14,940
Of course I will if I can.

911
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:19,040
I want you to love those babies for me.

912
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:23,960
Well, Lee, you know I will.

913
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:33,120
I'm making you uncomfortable, aren't I?

914
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:39,060
Look, I know that we haven't
been particularly close.

915
00:59:39,090 --> 00:59:40,210
Of course we have.

916
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,160
We're family.

917
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:46,360
Those children are never
really going to know me.

918
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,580
You're going to be
the only grandma I know.

919
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:52,500
No, there's no need to talk that way, Lee.

920
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:53,660
You're going to be fine.

921
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:56,720
Just fine.

922
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,160
Right.

923
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:01,660
I'm going to die.

924
01:00:01,690 --> 01:00:06,660
Doris,
I want to ask for your honest

925
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:11,400
understanding because you
can give me peace of mind.

926
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,840
I know you're going to be a fine
grandmother to those kids,

927
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:27,760
but I wonder if you could remind him once
in a while that he had another grandpa.

928
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:37,920
And maybe you could hug him for me.

929
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:43,940
Do you think you could do that to us?

930
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:46,420
I will.
That promise?

931
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:48,240
I will.

932
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,940
I'll love them for both of us.
So help me.

933
01:00:51,970 --> 01:00:53,560
Go.

934
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,040
Hello?

935
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:11,580
Okay, go ahead.

936
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:14,780
We'll be there as soon as we can.
I was Dr.

937
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:16,360
Braxton.
Everything is worse.

938
01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:19,240
They have to operate right away.

939
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,860
Julian is fine.

940
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:33,060
Oh, thank God.

941
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:34,160
His relief was immediate.

942
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:35,500
He's breathing on his own.

943
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:37,700
He's calm, feeding very well.

944
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:40,960
You can probably take him home tomorrow.

945
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,780
Thank you so much, Dr.
Bracket.

946
01:01:42,810 --> 01:01:44,500
Thank you.
You're welcome.

947
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:47,720
Oh, our family is finally
going to be together.

948
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,180
Oh, Julian.

949
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:55,140
I promise you might hold you
in my arms and here you are.

950
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:57,900
I didn't think I could
prime away from Becky.

951
01:01:57,930 --> 01:02:00,940
She has my golden.
Since we're at the hospital this morning.

952
01:02:00,970 --> 01:02:04,180
There'S no one else on earth
I'd hand him over to today.

953
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,520
I knew you were going to pull through.

954
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:06,660
A sweet little one.

955
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:10,080
You turned out to be
the strongest one of all.

956
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,620
Yes, you're going to be
a musician, little Julian.

957
01:02:23,650 --> 01:02:25,960
This is for you.

958
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:38,360
Look, everyone, julie is home with us.

959
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:09,520
That is about the coldest thing
you could say to a professional.

960
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,210
Hello?

961
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:19,700
Hey, Debt, what's up?

962
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:22,700
She's taking a turn for the worse.

963
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:28,120
I thought she should know
I'll come right down.

964
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:19,860
She ain't on the line for Julian.

965
01:05:19,890 --> 01:05:23,800
Otherwise she would have died weeks ago.

966
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:33,600
She said to say goodbye to you
and that she loves you

967
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:39,160
and not to worry because you're
going to be a real good dad.

968
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:54,100
I heard you moving around.

969
01:05:54,130 --> 01:05:56,340
I made coffee.

970
01:05:56,370 --> 01:05:57,940
Thank you.

971
01:05:57,970 --> 01:06:00,100
When Keith's getting back?

972
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:02,210
He is helping his dad
make the arrangements.

973
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:04,960
Later today, I think.

974
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:10,660
Mind if I stay with you, princess?

975
01:06:10,690 --> 01:06:14,120
You haven't called me that in years.

976
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:16,700
I know you're feeling terrible, Becky.

977
01:06:16,730 --> 01:06:20,720
Please don't try and hide it around me.

978
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:24,020
I know you had something special with her.

979
01:06:24,050 --> 01:06:26,760
I respect that.

980
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:36,360
Say the keys when he gets home.

981
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:39,660
Just be normal.

982
01:06:39,690 --> 01:06:40,820
Just give him a break.

983
01:06:40,850 --> 01:06:43,940
Maybe forget about the chores for a while.

984
01:06:43,970 --> 01:06:45,660
It's a big house.

985
01:06:45,690 --> 01:06:48,820
Your father can't keep it up alone.
Remember?

986
01:06:48,850 --> 01:06:51,460
We only moved here for God's sake.

987
01:06:51,490 --> 01:06:52,620
He is up on him.

988
01:06:52,650 --> 01:06:54,240
Okay?

989
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:57,960
I'm only thinking about the babies.

990
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,780
Oh, I'm so sorry about your mother, Keith.

991
01:07:22,810 --> 01:07:24,100
Thank you.

992
01:07:24,130 --> 01:07:25,340
Where's Becky?

993
01:07:25,370 --> 01:07:28,020
Oh, she's upstairs
with poor little Brenna.

994
01:07:28,050 --> 01:07:29,140
Is she okay?

995
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:32,840
She's been kind of colicky.

996
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:43,500
She's been like this all day?

997
01:07:43,530 --> 01:07:44,540
Yeah.

998
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:47,000
Keith does something really wrong.
She's all sunset.

999
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,380
She'll stop crying.
She's getting worse.

1000
01:07:49,410 --> 01:07:51,360
It's okay.

1001
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:02,260
I can't make a definitive diagnosis yet,

1002
01:08:02,290 --> 01:08:07,540
but I want you and Kate to begin a regimen
of very gentle motion exercises.

1003
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:09,060
I know that's easier said than done

1004
01:08:09,090 --> 01:08:12,260
with five other babies,
but it's important that the movements be

1005
01:08:12,290 --> 01:08:15,580
repeated for as long and as
often as she will tolerate them.

1006
01:08:15,610 --> 01:08:17,340
We'll manage.

1007
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:19,160
I know it's preliminary, but what do.

1008
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:21,540
You think it might be?

1009
01:08:21,570 --> 01:08:26,260
The curled up, rigidity refusal to be
comforted, the avoidance of eye contact

1010
01:08:26,290 --> 01:08:29,020
could be early signs
of a neurological depth.

1011
01:08:29,050 --> 01:08:31,920
Cerebral palsy.

1012
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,580
There was something I could do for her.

1013
01:08:43,610 --> 01:08:45,840
That's hopeless.

1014
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:51,500
S.
I think I should take some time off work.

1015
01:08:51,530 --> 01:08:52,700
Just be with her.

1016
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:54,100
She needs around the clock attention,

1017
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:55,900
honey, and you have your hands
full with the other five.

1018
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,180
You know what Doris is going to say?

1019
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:59,940
She's going to say that she could take
care of all the others and then I could

1020
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:02,740
work with Brenna and then you wouldn't
have to take time off from work.

1021
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:04,140
She's going to say that you're flaky.

1022
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:05,280
I don't care what she thinks.

1023
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:07,920
Brennan needs me.

1024
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:14,580
For God's sake.

1025
01:09:14,610 --> 01:09:19,400
You should carry Brenna
while you're vacuuming.

1026
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:23,020
She likes it.

1027
01:09:23,050 --> 01:09:25,300
Well, you have to put her down sometime.

1028
01:09:25,330 --> 01:09:27,000
Here.

1029
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:46,480
Her symptoms are completely gone.

1030
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:51,020
We just did what you told us to.

1031
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:52,700
Basically, I carried
her around and worked.

1032
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:56,100
Her arms and legs for twelve days,
16 hours a day.

1033
01:09:56,130 --> 01:09:58,060
Well, given that all her tests are

1034
01:09:58,090 --> 01:10:01,460
negative, I have to conclude
that Brenda was just frightened.

1035
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:02,820
Insecure.

1036
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:05,260
Not at all uncommon
in high multiple families.

1037
01:10:05,290 --> 01:10:08,140
Nice work, Keith.
You know what?

1038
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:11,320
The first time I really feel like a dad.

1039
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:17,780
Albert called me into his
office this morning.

1040
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,340
Seems the Chamber of Commerce wants

1041
01:10:19,370 --> 01:10:22,100
to have a sex Tuplet
stay at Fairy Tale Farm.

1042
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:24,100
Give folks here about
the chance to see the babies.

1043
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:25,700
Now they're doing so well at all.

1044
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:29,020
As I recall, uncle Albert owns
Fairytale Farm, doesn't he?

1045
01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:31,860
He's one of the owners and our boss.

1046
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:33,300
I think it's a wonderful idea.

1047
01:10:33,330 --> 01:10:35,300
Everybody wants to see the baby.

1048
01:10:35,330 --> 01:10:36,420
I don't think so.

1049
01:10:36,450 --> 01:10:39,940
All those people crowding around
and we can't expose them to all.

1050
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:41,660
Come on.
We won't have to stay long.

1051
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:44,900
We'll just hold the babies and shake
some hands and then go home.

1052
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:46,020
I don't know, Mother.

1053
01:10:46,050 --> 01:10:49,180
Oh, my friends at the Hairdressers
are after me constantly.

1054
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:51,460
I don't know what to tell them anymore.

1055
01:10:51,490 --> 01:10:53,060
I think it's a bad idea.

1056
01:10:53,090 --> 01:10:55,860
I think we owe it to people.

1057
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:58,220
Hi.
Hello.

1058
01:10:58,250 --> 01:11:01,040
Is this thing working?

1059
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:03,580
It is so nice being here.

1060
01:11:03,610 --> 01:11:04,720
It's gorgeous.

1061
01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:05,780
Summer day.

1062
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:12,440
Can you introduce you to Adrian,
Claire, Brenna, Quinn, Ian and Julian?

1063
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:18,420
Keith and Becky have been thrilled
with your generous donations.

1064
01:11:18,450 --> 01:11:22,700
And as you can imagine, caring for six
little ones is quite a challenge.

1065
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:26,920
And your support has made it
so much easier for all of us.

1066
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:36,420
Honey, you wouldn't want the baby
to catch a cold, would you?

1067
01:11:36,450 --> 01:11:37,740
Thank you.

1068
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,340
Can you look them up so
I can get their face?

1069
01:11:39,370 --> 01:11:41,100
I don't think so.

1070
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:44,760
Hey, I promised my daughter that she.
Could hold one of them.

1071
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:45,220
You wouldn't mind?

1072
01:11:45,250 --> 01:11:48,260
I'm sorry, but we're going
to take a break right now.

1073
01:11:48,290 --> 01:11:50,300
Let us through, please.

1074
01:11:50,330 --> 01:11:51,580
Thank you.

1075
01:11:51,610 --> 01:11:53,680
Excuse me.

1076
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:13,620
What is going on?

1077
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:15,420
The Mary is going to come by any minute.

1078
01:12:15,450 --> 01:12:17,260
Is there a marriage or something?

1079
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:18,980
I am taking them out of this freak show.

1080
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,260
Let's go now.

1081
01:12:20,290 --> 01:12:22,500
No, we can't go yet.
They're selling tickets.

1082
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:24,400
People are coming from all over to see

1083
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:29,300
the baby, and we should put them at risk
so people will get their money's worth.

1084
01:12:29,330 --> 01:12:32,600
Oh, I give up.

1085
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:42,020
Please, let us move.

1086
01:12:42,050 --> 01:12:43,640
Please.

1087
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:46,880
Thank you.
I'm sorry.

1088
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:51,620
We are never, ever doing that again.

1089
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:53,580
I hate living here.
I have no control.

1090
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:56,660
I don't like it anymore than you do,
but what else can you I don't know.

1091
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:57,800
But if we keep on living here.

1092
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:59,660
We might as well just sign custody over.

1093
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:01,460
Doris, we need to be practical.

1094
01:13:01,490 --> 01:13:03,580
I'm sick of being tragical.
He's going to hear you.

1095
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:04,340
I don't give a damn.

1096
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:07,740
I don't understand what good it does for
you to stand here and throw this tantrum.

1097
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:08,260
You know what?

1098
01:13:08,290 --> 01:13:11,600
You are actually beginning
to sound like her.

1099
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:18,900
We need to go.

1100
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:19,980
We need to start over.

1101
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,140
Let's take the kids and let's go.

1102
01:13:22,170 --> 01:13:23,780
You mean it?

1103
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:25,740
You are the most important
thing in the world to me.

1104
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:29,420
If you're not happy, we're out
of here right now, tonight.

1105
01:13:29,450 --> 01:13:31,520
You're serious?

1106
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:35,540
If we don't go, we'll never get out.

1107
01:13:35,570 --> 01:13:38,580
Where are you going
in the middle of the night?

1108
01:13:38,610 --> 01:13:40,180
Indianapolis.
That's all we know.

1109
01:13:40,210 --> 01:13:41,620
You can't take the baby.

1110
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:43,820
Why would you do this?
Why?

1111
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:46,380
Because if I don't,
I'm going to lose my husband.

1112
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,780
That's why.
Do you understand that?

1113
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,260
Do you have any idea what
you are doing to us?

1114
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:52,540
You are not their parents.

1115
01:13:52,570 --> 01:13:54,180
We are.

1116
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:56,100
What am I supposed to say to people?

1117
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:57,340
Oh, is that what matters here?

1118
01:13:57,370 --> 01:13:59,680
What people think?

1119
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:02,540
This is your doing.

1120
01:14:02,570 --> 01:14:06,540
After all the help we've given you,
you turned my own daughter again?

1121
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:09,320
You know what?
You are wrong.

1122
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:10,900
You are wrong.

1123
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:13,300
This has got nothing to do with Keith.

1124
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:16,400
This is about you and me.

1125
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:20,460
Lauren, say something.

1126
01:14:20,490 --> 01:14:22,800
Drive carefully.

1127
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:45,220
Oh, are we crazy?

1128
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:47,200
We haven't got a pot to warm milk in.

1129
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:50,780
Keith, what are you grinning about?

1130
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,180
Damage myself.

1131
01:14:53,210 --> 01:14:54,740
Why are you grinning?

1132
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:56,340
Because I love you.

1133
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:57,380
Well, that's a good thing,

1134
01:14:57,410 --> 01:15:01,080
because right now, love is
about all we got going for us.

1135
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,180
I can look for a job managing a lunch

1136
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:15,780
shift change, usually
looking for good managers.

1137
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:20,320
Or I could go out and get a radiology or
oncology job tomorrow for three times what

1138
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:22,980
you would make, not to mention
a better health plan.

1139
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,580
Sounds like you want to go back to work.

1140
01:15:24,610 --> 01:15:26,260
Okay, if you know I don't.

1141
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:29,580
Just the thought of leaving these
babies every day tears me up inside.

1142
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,100
So why does it keep coming up?

1143
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:33,260
Oh, convince me there's another way.
Please.

1144
01:15:33,290 --> 01:15:35,700
I'll work two jobs.

1145
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:37,460
I'll do whatever it takes.
No way.

1146
01:15:37,490 --> 01:15:40,040
We'd never see you.

1147
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:44,100
Trust me to look after them?

1148
01:15:44,130 --> 01:15:46,080
Of course.

1149
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:50,520
And I would still be
here 15 hours every day.

1150
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:55,500
They will be the cleanest, most well fed,

1151
01:15:55,530 --> 01:16:00,040
most carefully changed,
thoroughly burped babies in the world.

1152
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:08,900
The references are first rate,
and I made a few calls.

1153
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:10,620
You've got an excellent reputation.

1154
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:11,700
Thank you.

1155
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:14,740
My only concern is dependability.

1156
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:19,180
I mean, with six babies at home,
won't you constantly be late or absent?

1157
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,220
My husband's going to be a full time dad.

1158
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:22,460
Oh, really?

1159
01:16:22,490 --> 01:16:25,680
So does that make you a part time mom?

1160
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:29,620
We're doing what we consider
best for our children.

1161
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:33,360
And how we decide to do
that is none of your business.

1162
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:36,280
Becky, wait.

1163
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:38,180
I'm sorry.

1164
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:40,060
I needed to know where
you were coming from.

1165
01:16:40,090 --> 01:16:42,180
I have high risk patience on this, Ward.

1166
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:43,420
If you were going to be running home

1167
01:16:43,450 --> 01:16:46,820
to your babies every day,
I couldn't use you here.

1168
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:49,560
So when can you start?

1169
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:56,660
Yeah.

1170
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:59,060
Mommy can miss you so much.

1171
01:16:59,090 --> 01:17:02,300
We're going to be late.
We'll be fine.

1172
01:17:02,330 --> 01:17:04,780
In fact, we will be exceptional.

1173
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:05,820
Are you sure?

1174
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:08,340
You are talking to a
professional manager here.

1175
01:17:08,370 --> 01:17:09,740
It just takes assistance.

1176
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:12,900
But, Keith, if you can't handle this,
just page me immediately.

1177
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:14,960
Okay?
Go.

1178
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:20,440
I love you all.

1179
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,580
Everything's fine, honey.

1180
01:17:38,610 --> 01:17:40,340
How did you know it's me?

1181
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:41,680
Because it's been just long enough for.

1182
01:17:41,710 --> 01:17:43,820
Me to get to the hospital.

1183
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:46,060
Good luck on your first day.
Thanks.

1184
01:17:46,090 --> 01:17:48,400
You, too, honey.

1185
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:09,400
Hang on, Twitter.
You're next in line.

1186
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,560
Yes, you are.

1187
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:44,740
Honey, what's going on here?

1188
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:48,040
What have you done with my husband?

1189
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:52,580
Why don't you go shower and get

1190
01:18:52,610 --> 01:18:55,460
comfortable, and I'll have
dinner ready when you come out?

1191
01:18:55,490 --> 01:18:57,700
You did all this and you cook?

1192
01:18:57,720 --> 01:19:01,560
I'm good, but I'm not that good.

1193
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:13,300
Bothers to do this stuff in my day.

1194
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:15,580
Meaning you don't think I
should be staying home?

1195
01:19:15,610 --> 01:19:18,620
No, I'm sorry.

1196
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:19,860
I'm all fine.

1197
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:21,340
Don't worry about it.

1198
01:19:21,370 --> 01:19:24,560
I'm just glad to have your company.

1199
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:27,120
It's okay.

1200
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:29,060
Hey, dad, can you hear me?
Mom's?

1201
01:19:29,090 --> 01:19:30,960
Music bar.

1202
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:33,120
Thanks.

1203
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:42,020
There you go, Jim.

1204
01:19:42,050 --> 01:19:46,800
That's Grandma lease song just for you.

1205
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:49,040
Your mom would be very proud.

1206
01:19:49,070 --> 01:19:50,720
Of you.

1207
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:05,880
Becky.

1208
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:08,700
What are you doing here?

1209
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:10,380
You're not mad I came?

1210
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,140
Well, it depends on what you came for.

1211
01:20:12,170 --> 01:20:14,540
I couldn't stand it anymore.

1212
01:20:14,570 --> 01:20:16,700
So are the babies.

1213
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:17,940
They're thriving.

1214
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:21,180
Keith is amazing with them.

1215
01:20:21,210 --> 01:20:23,980
I only want what's best for all of you.

1216
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,600
It doesn't seem that way, Mother.

1217
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,140
I just get a little too bossy, I guess.

1218
01:20:31,170 --> 01:20:32,820
I'm sorry.

1219
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:35,720
I won't go back to the way it was.
You won't have to.

1220
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:37,360
I promise.
I'm telling you, you are going to have

1221
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:40,060
to change the way that you treat me
and the way that you deal with Keith.

1222
01:20:40,090 --> 01:20:41,800
I know.

1223
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:48,060
Do you think Keith is
ever going to forgive me?

1224
01:20:48,090 --> 01:20:50,800
Yeah, I think so.

1225
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:57,240
He's gotten a lot of practice with me.

1226
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:03,940
Since I was in Indianapolis.

1227
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:05,440
Anyway, I thought you would mind if.

1228
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:06,940
I dropped in to stay.

1229
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:10,760
Well, I'm glad you did.

1230
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:15,660
I could look after them this afternoon
if you want to take a break with me.

1231
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:17,140
It's nice to you, but there's nowhere I'd

1232
01:21:17,170 --> 01:21:21,320
rather be than right here
changing the diapers.

1233
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:23,860
I could never rate six babies.

1234
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:26,060
As good as you and Becky are.

1235
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:28,140
I barely got through one.

1236
01:21:28,170 --> 01:21:33,760
These children are truly blessed.

1237
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:38,940
Thank you, Doris.

1238
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:41,040
I'm sorry.

1239
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:49,360
He didn't do it to hurt you.

1240
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:52,580
I just want to be a grandma.

1241
01:21:52,610 --> 01:21:55,320
If you'll let me.

1242
01:21:58,040 --> 01:21:59,620
Adrian here.

1243
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:03,520
Looks like he's about ready for a bottle.

1244
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:11,320
Thank you.

1245
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:15,220
Do you remember me?
Yeah.

1246
01:22:15,250 --> 01:22:17,620
I'm your grandmother.

1247
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:20,660
That's right.
Yeah.

1248
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:22,860
Are you hungry?

1249
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:26,600
You had another grandma?

1250
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:28,900
Grandma leave.

1251
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:30,780
You know what she told me?

1252
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:35,460
She told me to tell you
that she loved you very much.

1253
01:22:35,490 --> 01:22:38,520
Yeah, that's right.

1254
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:43,520
Okay.

1255
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:52,540
Hi, Quinn.

1256
01:22:52,570 --> 01:22:53,660
Hi, Quinnie.

1257
01:22:53,680 --> 01:23:11,820
Boy, you funny.

1258
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:13,440
Boy.

1259
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:16,760
You better get going.

1260
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:23,760
So, what do you think?

1261
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:25,660
Beautiful.

1262
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:28,460
I wish I could be here when
the rest of them wake up to see it.

1263
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:31,100
You won't do anything fun until you
get home from work, right?

1264
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:32,120
You're so good with them.

1265
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:33,420
They probably don't even miss me.

1266
01:23:33,450 --> 01:23:34,620
Of course they do.

1267
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:37,280
You're just saying that.

1268
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:42,700
Hey, I got this year's special moment.
You did?

1269
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,880
Which one?
Where?

1270
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:49,660
That's my wedding ring.

1271
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:52,560
Oh, my goodness.

1272
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:59,400
Merry Christmas.

1273
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:04,440
Merry Christmas.

1274
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:13,140
Well, this certainly isn't the life
that we imagined we were going to have.

1275
01:24:13,170 --> 01:24:16,820
Sometimes things don't work
out the way we imagined.

1276
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:20,100
Sometimes they work out better.

1277
01:24:20,130 --> 01:24:25,220
And we just feel like every day
is a brand new miracle.

1278
01:24:25,250 --> 01:24:27,780
An answer, prayer.

1279
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:29,580
And we are so grateful.

1280
01:24:29,610 --> 01:24:34,400
And
we have faith in ourselves and in our

1281
01:24:34,420 --> 01:24:39,980
children and in our families
and in our wonderful hospital family.

1282
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:45,320
And I just want everyone to know that we
are all going to make it just fine.

1283
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:50,260
The glory of my tears the glory
of I'll have to go out with guys.

1284
01:25:50,290 --> 01:25:53,120
The answer is no.
My whole life.
