1
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:39,306
He drove his car straight into a wall.

2
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:44,580
Either his car failed on him,
or he was committing suicide.

3
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:48,089
He's completely unconscious.

4
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:11,342
In the center of Los Angeles!

5
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:14,834
I made it!

6
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,216
Around nine o'clock, Clara.

7
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:23,548
Just now. I just got off the truck.

8
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:27,589
Look, I'll have you
and the little one here in no time.

9
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:30,783
Five thousand dollars.

10
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,721
What's five thousand dollars hers?

11
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,197
Hers, the gringos earn in green bills!

12
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:40,704
How did you get this?

13
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:44,205
I killed someone
who looked just like you.

14
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:49,546
Come on, what do you think?
I have friends.

15
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,747
You better treat it like your son.

16
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:59,151
It costs a lot of money to buy
this shit on the black market.

17
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,658
You're gonna go to heaven for this!

18
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:08,429
I got your back, bro.
Welcome to the United States!

19
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:21,982
They get ten dollars an hour, plus tips!

20
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,494
That's four times what we get!

21
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:29,428
You know why?
They think we have nowhere to go.

22
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:33,064
We have to do something, bro.

23
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,452
We're not going in today.
We're on strike.

24
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,080
Are you nuts?

25
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,517
We'll get fired.

26
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,753
We're gonna teach that asshole a lesson.

27
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:02,455
He thinks he can pay us shit
just 'cause we're illegal.

28
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,396
Well, no more.

29
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:09,972
Easy for you to say.
You don't have a wife and a kid.

30
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,904
Listen to me, man.

31
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:16,113
I'm the one who got you that job,

32
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:18,846
and I say we don't go today.

33
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:23,515
I came here to make money.

34
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:28,020
Every penny I earn I send back home.

35
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:30,661
Don't count on me.

36
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:33,463
I'm not risking my job.

37
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:36,065
You and Spikey can stay
and play house. Not me.

38
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,834
If you're gonna be that Paki's bitch,

39
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:43,804
better pack your shit and leave,
'cause you're not coming back hers.

40
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:45,976
Fins with me.

41
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:11,094
Welcome to the United States.

42
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:16,094
You guys wanna work?

43
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:19,162
Eighteen Months Later

44
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,128
Taka-san?

45
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:32,295
Taka-san!

46
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,230
Why?

47
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:07,470
Can I borrows pen?

48
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:14,436
What's the date today?

49
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,472
March 30th.

50
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,007
And the year?

51
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:19,877
2004.

52
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:31,951
30/03/2004. Born again.

53
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:44,370
You took care of me all this while?

54
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:02,786
Thank you very much for your kindness.

55
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,757
You're welcome.

56
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:38,089
One year later

57
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:44,452
Tuesday cloudy day.

58
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:12,972
Do you love me?

59
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:03,583
Thursday cloudy day.

60
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:18,017
What's up?

61
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:20,321
I know.

62
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,361
He's a bit slow.

63
00:51:57,747 --> 00:52:03,527
Saturday sunny day.
Made a friend. An American.

64
01:02:32,515 --> 01:02:33,960
Do you love me?

65
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:30,735
You're doing a good job, Julio.

66
01:09:30,933 --> 01:09:35,439
That car's pretty sweet.
So smooth!

67
01:09:37,306 --> 01:09:39,445
I've never driven anything
so smooth before.

68
01:09:39,642 --> 01:09:43,749
Here we drive the best cars
and get paid for it.

69
01:09:43,946 --> 01:09:45,323
You're right!

70
01:09:46,949 --> 01:09:50,260
It's the best job in the world.

71
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:53,627
Hey, they're waiting.

72
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:42,439
I miss you a lot.

73
01:10:45,307 --> 01:10:47,378
What are you wearing?

74
01:10:50,346 --> 01:10:51,518
What?

75
01:10:53,949 --> 01:10:58,625
Oscar! What are you doing up so late?

76
01:11:00,689 --> 01:11:02,999
Did you like the sweater I sent you?

77
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:06,963
That's good.

78
01:11:07,363 --> 01:11:11,436
You be good, okay?
Go to bed already.

79
01:11:11,634 --> 01:11:13,375
Pass me to your mom.

80
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:22,619
I miss you so much, Clara.

81
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:26,851
I know it's been...

82
01:11:27,049 --> 01:11:30,519
I know I already promised,
but things are gonna change.

83
01:11:32,655 --> 01:11:37,263
The flower shop is doing well.
I already saved $4,000.

84
01:11:39,662 --> 01:11:41,573
I promise. This time it will happen.

85
01:23:20,161 --> 01:23:25,372
Saturday sunny day.
Made a friend. An American.

86
01:23:29,304 --> 01:23:32,717
I saw a man talk to his can

87
01:23:38,513 --> 01:23:41,653
It was beautiful... so intimate.

88
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:13,814
The thing is,
I lost my partner in the flower shop.

89
01:25:17,612 --> 01:25:21,253
Don't worry. I'm taking care of it.

90
01:25:21,449 --> 01:25:23,190
Come on! it's time!

91
01:25:24,819 --> 01:25:29,825
Hey, I gotta go.
I gotta run a staff meeting.

92
01:25:30,225 --> 01:25:32,102
I'll talk to you tomorrow, okay?

93
01:25:35,697 --> 01:25:37,176
I love you.

94
01:25:42,437 --> 01:25:43,507
Thanks.

95
01:26:03,191 --> 01:26:05,296
Good luck in America!
