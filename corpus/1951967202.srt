1
00:05:01,859 --> 00:05:03,312
Je m'appelle Victoria

2
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:06,068
Je m'appelle Victoria

3
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,741
Comment allez-vous?

4
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,117
Santé... no... no...

5
00:05:13,686 --> 00:05:15,376
My sister sent me a postcard

6
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:20,692
All it said was: come to Paris,
it will be good for you

7
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,352
48 hours after I arrived...

8
00:05:29,338 --> 00:05:31,604
...she and everyone I've
met were dead

9
00:05:38,863 --> 00:05:39,807
Open the bag

10
00:05:39,857 --> 00:05:41,131
Sorry?

11
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:49,769
- Open the bag
- Open my bag? Ok

12
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,309
Have you been in Paris before?

13
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,554
No, I've never been
here before

14
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,037
I get nervous sometimes

15
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:17,561
- Ne comprend vous francais?
- Sorry? I don't understand

16
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:19,329
She asked you if
you understand French

17
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,617
No, I don't speak french

18
00:06:27,915 --> 00:06:29,920
Are you staying in a hotel room?

19
00:06:30,087 --> 00:06:32,607
I'm staying with my sister

20
00:06:33,706 --> 00:06:35,504
Hey, welcome to Paris

21
00:06:35,826 --> 00:06:37,484
Have you fun yet?

22
00:06:37,805 --> 00:06:40,002
She's... I don't know where
she's staying...

23
00:06:40,052 --> 00:06:42,557
...but she studies
at the Sorbone

24
00:06:47,043 --> 00:06:48,463
Her address?

25
00:06:48,685 --> 00:06:51,724
I don't know. I'm sorry
She's picking me up at the airport

26
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,757
I don't know

27
00:07:05,371 --> 00:07:07,538
Welcome to France

28
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:12,519
This trip is gonna
change you forever

29
00:07:13,787 --> 00:07:14,922
Aren't you excited?

30
00:07:15,683 --> 00:07:17,638
Yeah definitely. I just
have a headache

31
00:07:19,996 --> 00:07:22,778
There is the sister I remember

32
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:14,587
Where are we going?

33
00:08:20,143 --> 00:08:21,418
This is where you live?

34
00:08:21,746 --> 00:08:23,805
Yep. Is pretty creepy, right?

35
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,462
Got a good deal with the rent, though

36
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,137
You'll loved this

37
00:08:31,486 --> 00:08:34,703
France's first serial killer
had a room on the fifth floor

38
00:08:34,954 --> 00:08:36,976
He chopped a bunch of bodies
before someone complains...

39
00:08:36,977 --> 00:08:39,672
...about the noise the bone saw
is making everyday

40
00:08:40,176 --> 00:08:42,893
They making proud of him
But the guy went fucking mental

41
00:08:44,325 --> 00:08:48,217
By the time the cops got here,
he already killed everyone in the fourth...

42
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,430
After the massacre
everyone moved out...

43
00:08:56,785 --> 00:08:59,719
Too much bad blood, they said

44
00:09:05,013 --> 00:09:08,191
- What?
- I'm just fucking with you

45
00:09:08,241 --> 00:09:09,758
It's just a shit building

46
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,345
You gotta learn to lighten up, honey

47
00:09:12,346 --> 00:09:16,176
There's not a homicidal maniac
lurking in every shadow

48
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,044
Alright. Turn the light on,
would you?

49
00:09:37,214 --> 00:09:38,962
I don't know where the light is

50
00:09:39,117 --> 00:09:40,903
I wasn't talking to you

51
00:09:41,787 --> 00:09:43,207
What?

52
00:09:50,693 --> 00:09:54,311
Is every single moment of your life
into scare the shit out of people?

53
00:09:54,492 --> 00:09:58,338
Even that as a suggestion
breaks my heart, Carolyn

54
00:09:59,439 --> 00:10:02,892
Don't take it personal. They do it
to everyone. Are you ok?

55
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:05,830
Yeah, I know is...
Where I'll sleep?

56
00:10:05,963 --> 00:10:07,498
Sleep in Baltimore, Vic

57
00:10:07,548 --> 00:10:10,184
Nor even the dead sleep in Paris

58
00:10:10,766 --> 00:10:13,603
It's just I didn't sleep
on the plane last night

59
00:10:13,653 --> 00:10:16,440
I was nervous about the flight
so I can't sleep...

60
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,914
Yeah, well... Sorry there's no time

61
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:22,028
We got a party to get ready for

62
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:27,311
Sorry? There's no way I can
go to a party tonight

63
00:10:28,447 --> 00:10:30,483
Not dressed like mom,
you can't

64
00:10:31,644 --> 00:10:33,690
C'mon. Let's go shopping

65
00:11:28,781 --> 00:11:29,784
Do you feel ok?

66
00:11:29,821 --> 00:11:31,679
Yeah...

67
00:11:35,816 --> 00:11:38,460
Sure don't have anything
to say to Quasimodo?

68
00:11:46,066 --> 00:11:47,486
What do you think so far?

69
00:11:48,219 --> 00:11:49,144
Of what?

70
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,114
Of what? Of Paris!

71
00:11:53,437 --> 00:11:55,574
Look around you, is the
most beautiful city in the world!

72
00:11:55,896 --> 00:11:59,724
The City of light. Romance,
art, architecture, beauty...

73
00:12:00,006 --> 00:12:03,852
It's hard to imagine that stays on top
of the larger mass grave of the history

74
00:12:06,287 --> 00:12:09,324
C'mon. You can't go to a
party without the shoes

75
00:12:48,705 --> 00:12:50,242
Oh, God! You scared me!

76
00:12:50,513 --> 00:12:52,637
You? You usually are
so calm and collected

77
00:12:54,022 --> 00:12:55,290
What are you taking?

78
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,279
Nothing... I told you I have a headache

79
00:12:59,874 --> 00:13:02,517
Well, spin that ass!
The taxi's coming

80
00:14:13,182 --> 00:14:15,776
Victoria, this is my dear friend Hugo...

81
00:14:15,777 --> 00:14:18,019
He's one of the hosts of
the most fabulous party...

82
00:14:18,543 --> 00:14:21,136
Hugo, this is my infamous
sister Victoria

83
00:14:21,367 --> 00:14:23,330
Je m'appelle Victoria

84
00:14:24,107 --> 00:14:26,591
We all speak english here, sister

85
00:14:27,421 --> 00:14:29,140
- Ok
- Ok

86
00:14:32,653 --> 00:14:34,342
What am I? An amateur?

87
00:14:34,392 --> 00:14:37,192
No. This is for your sister

88
00:14:37,717 --> 00:14:38,848
For me?

89
00:14:39,193 --> 00:14:42,302
- Ladies, please. Come in
- Au revoir, mon cherie

90
00:14:46,781 --> 00:14:47,897
C'mon sis

91
00:14:48,466 --> 00:14:50,296
Carolyn wait
Where are we going?

92
00:14:50,346 --> 00:14:52,126
It's too late to turn back now

93
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:58,075
I don't understand
What kind of party is this?

94
00:14:59,252 --> 00:15:01,814
This is the kind of party
that'll change your life

95
00:15:02,211 --> 00:15:03,661
It changed mine, anyway

96
00:15:06,013 --> 00:15:08,497
Seriously, why anybody want to
throw a party down here?

97
00:15:08,633 --> 00:15:11,049
Because this is where the
dead bodies are

98
00:15:12,117 --> 00:15:15,142
You're just trying to scare me?
Aren't you?

99
00:15:15,463 --> 00:15:18,666
I'm not. I swear. Everything
I'd say is absolutely true

100
00:15:18,993 --> 00:15:21,113
Paris' dirty old secrets

101
00:15:21,472 --> 00:15:24,684
"Abandon all hope
here you enter"

102
00:15:25,044 --> 00:15:26,356
Pretty

103
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:31,379
200 years ago, Paris ran out
of room to bury its dead

104
00:15:32,472 --> 00:15:37,175
The graveyards were stuffed,
like fifteen bodies deep

105
00:15:37,334 --> 00:15:40,514
The corpses were rotting
in the streets

106
00:15:40,526 --> 00:15:45,723
Some brilliant person decides to
start over. Just dig out the bodies...

107
00:15:45,773 --> 00:15:49,815
...of every dead person
in Paris. All seven millions of them...

108
00:15:50,136 --> 00:15:53,066
...and stuck their bones in this
mines shafts under the left bank

109
00:15:53,116 --> 00:15:55,510
- Seven millions?
- Isn't that funny?

110
00:15:56,209 --> 00:15:57,756
Don't the police try to stop you?

111
00:15:58,115 --> 00:16:03,231
They tried. They created a whole task force
to shut us down. The "catacops"

112
00:16:03,552 --> 00:16:07,865
There's 300 miles of tunnels under the city
and we never go party the same place twice

113
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:10,911
Que-ce tu fais?
Que-ce tu fais?

114
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:21,240
Do you remember Nico and Leon?

115
00:16:22,377 --> 00:16:23,300
Hey

116
00:16:23,522 --> 00:16:26,369
Let's move, Jean-Michele
is waiting for us

117
00:16:30,472 --> 00:16:31,719
Who is Jean-Michele?

118
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:33,365
You'll meet him

119
00:16:33,725 --> 00:16:37,176
He and Hugo were who came with
the idea of throw out parties down here

120
00:16:44,776 --> 00:16:47,978
...have become more and more popular...

121
00:16:48,754 --> 00:16:54,122
I have being accused in the press
of being in love with the death

122
00:16:54,361 --> 00:16:58,082
A kind of necrophilia, I suppose

123
00:17:01,748 --> 00:17:05,559
But in ancient Greece, it was
a practice of philosophers...

124
00:17:05,915 --> 00:17:11,237
...to keep a human skull
on their desk

125
00:17:11,711 --> 00:17:13,344
The idea was this...

126
00:17:14,257 --> 00:17:18,385
...only with a conscious awareness...

127
00:17:18,386 --> 00:17:20,784
...of our pending death

128
00:17:21,626 --> 00:17:24,005
Can we appreciate our life fully

129
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:30,119
I always found myself
persuaded by that sentiment

130
00:17:32,155 --> 00:17:34,016
The only problem is...

131
00:17:36,062 --> 00:17:38,064
...I never own a desk!

132
00:17:47,422 --> 00:17:50,104
Welcome to the Catacombs!

133
00:17:57,617 --> 00:17:58,843
Hello!

134
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:00,467
Hey there!

135
00:19:13,508 --> 00:19:15,947
A water, please?

136
00:19:18,436 --> 00:19:20,280
Can I have a water, please?

137
00:19:27,971 --> 00:19:30,116
You don't have to drink here

138
00:19:31,009 --> 00:19:34,774
- Are you Jean-Michele?
- Carolyn has told me a lot about you?

139
00:19:37,325 --> 00:19:39,712
What did she say?

140
00:19:40,516 --> 00:19:43,673
She said you are
afraid of the darkness

141
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:46,940
I'm not, really

142
00:19:47,084 --> 00:19:49,785
You're not? Because I am
We all are

143
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,178
Why the hell do you come
to this place, then?

144
00:19:56,708 --> 00:20:03,378
"It is God's kindness to terrify us
so that we become stronger"

145
00:20:11,014 --> 00:20:13,369
Where am I suppose to drink?

146
00:20:23,334 --> 00:20:25,464
You're wasting your time, Jean-Michele

147
00:20:25,785 --> 00:20:27,931
She doesn't drink alcohol

148
00:20:28,855 --> 00:20:30,792
It's not alcohol
It's absinthe

149
00:20:34,093 --> 00:20:38,716
- Go, go, go. C'mon!
- She did it!

150
00:20:40,175 --> 00:20:42,651
I can see this going very badly

151
00:21:02,707 --> 00:21:09,315
Hey! Space cadet!
Are you okay?

152
00:21:10,795 --> 00:21:16,919
So, since you arrived in Paris...
Did you see a ghost yet?

153
00:21:17,457 --> 00:21:21,326
- That line is getting so old...
- She's in Paris...

154
00:21:21,376 --> 00:21:24,507
The most haunted city in the world
It is a legitimate question

155
00:21:24,508 --> 00:21:27,153
Look around you
Six million people...

156
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:30,525
Torn from the ground and stacked
under your feet like wood for the fire...

157
00:21:30,575 --> 00:21:33,318
If there are ghost anywhere,
there are ghosts in Paris

158
00:21:33,368 --> 00:21:36,074
If there are ghosts anywhere,
there are ghosts in this place!

159
00:21:36,768 --> 00:21:40,041
You know, he's absolute right
The catacombs are haunted

160
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:45,571
But not by ghouls or specters
The catacombs are haunted by people

161
00:21:46,191 --> 00:21:51,155
The lowest creeps and lunatics drown
down from the surface by morbidity

162
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:57,785
Death is a spectacle
An opera

163
00:22:04,221 --> 00:22:08,276
When the cult of the Black Virgin
began inverting the rites of...

164
00:22:08,636 --> 00:22:12,720
...Catholiscism. Painting
the statue of Mary in black...

165
00:22:13,239 --> 00:22:15,310
...and praying to Satan...

166
00:22:16,046 --> 00:22:20,994
Even when those people claimed to have
given birth to the Antichrist

167
00:22:21,097 --> 00:22:24,091
No sane person
took them seriously

168
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:26,556
But they did

169
00:22:33,911 --> 00:22:34,871
They take a child...

170
00:22:39,798 --> 00:22:41,081
...born of the incest...

171
00:22:48,105 --> 00:22:49,841
...raised on raw meat...

172
00:22:55,483 --> 00:22:58,416
...they never allow
him to see daylight...

173
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,860
...tought him he was
the destroyer of man

174
00:23:01,623 --> 00:23:07,400
Dress him in a gruesome goatskin mask
What do you expect?

175
00:23:13,556 --> 00:23:19,144
By the time the boy was eighteen...
They have succeeded

176
00:23:26,165 --> 00:23:27,739
They have created...

177
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:31,508
...a hawking...

178
00:23:33,084 --> 00:23:34,863
...unthinking lunatic...

179
00:23:39,078 --> 00:23:40,619
...so evil...

180
00:23:47,454 --> 00:23:50,161
...that definitive he could
be called the Antichrist

181
00:23:51,761 --> 00:23:54,774
C'mon! A killer with a goat mask?

182
00:23:55,314 --> 00:23:57,870
It's just another myth
A more frightened one, but...

183
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,223
...still a myth

184
00:23:59,273 --> 00:24:02,243
There's articles in the newspapers
every week about people that come down...

185
00:24:02,293 --> 00:24:03,993
...to the catacombs and
never make it out

186
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:07,801
No, this is not a myth
This monster they had created...

187
00:24:08,592 --> 00:24:10,556
...is down here.
Somewhere

188
00:24:12,716 --> 00:24:16,868
Ok, you guys don't go to graduate
school with Carolyn. Do you?

189
00:24:21,538 --> 00:24:23,324
Let's go swimming

190
00:24:23,325 --> 00:24:26,021
What do you say sis?
Do you like taking a dip?

191
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,392
C'mon Vic! Nobody gives a shit
Get over it!

192
00:24:57,393 --> 00:25:00,379
Get naked. Get in the water

193
00:25:00,453 --> 00:25:02,128
Carolyn...

194
00:25:02,675 --> 00:25:05,621
- Carolyn
- C'mon! Take 'em out!

195
00:25:05,646 --> 00:25:08,805
It just your body.
You have a beautiful body

196
00:25:11,861 --> 00:25:13,542
You didn't see the Balboa

197
00:25:13,795 --> 00:25:16,237
Is nothing, you guys. I'm just
a little cold. That's all

198
00:25:16,536 --> 00:25:20,122
Yeah, right. Otherwise she
would been the first one in

199
00:25:20,509 --> 00:25:23,783
But it's cold!
I'm wanna go home!

200
00:25:24,546 --> 00:25:27,058
You know, Vic. You might try
for once in your life...

201
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:29,683
...to not be the lamest
person in the room

202
00:25:29,684 --> 00:25:30,714
Leave her alone!

203
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:34,357
Well, it gotta be me, right?
I think I'm gonna go back to the party

204
00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:39,267
That sounded much more
hateful that I meant

205
00:25:39,495 --> 00:25:41,908
Can somebody show me
the way back to the party?

206
00:25:44,553 --> 00:25:46,500
Is that way

207
00:25:50,354 --> 00:25:53,917
Looks like you're stuck.
And you have to go swimming

208
00:25:57,093 --> 00:25:59,870
- It's ok. I'll find it
- Vic, don't be a retard...

209
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,293
...you can go back alone.
You gonna get lost

210
00:26:02,343 --> 00:26:06,885
It's a maze.
Vic! Seriously!

211
00:26:07,054 --> 00:26:08,872
Vic!

212
00:27:09,843 --> 00:27:12,488
As with us soon you shall be

213
00:27:13,274 --> 00:27:14,575
Is what it says

214
00:27:15,579 --> 00:27:17,876
- You scared me
- Good

215
00:27:17,931 --> 00:27:20,140
People like you
need to be scared

216
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,367
I'm serious, dumbass.
Don't walk out like that. It's dangerous

217
00:27:24,417 --> 00:27:27,879
Sound doesn't travel in the Catacombs.
You could get lost before you know it

218
00:27:28,551 --> 00:27:31,690
You're not lost.
Are you?

219
00:27:32,172 --> 00:27:33,672
No. I don't think so

220
00:27:44,417 --> 00:27:45,800
Maybe I'm lost

221
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,579
Are you serious?

222
00:27:51,975 --> 00:27:54,170
What's so funny?

223
00:27:54,615 --> 00:27:58,002
Whoever wrote that doesn't think
it matters which way we go

224
00:27:58,196 --> 00:27:59,570
What it's say?

225
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,787
"There is but one way
to enter this life...

226
00:28:01,837 --> 00:28:03,925
...but the gates of death
are outnumbered"

227
00:28:03,975 --> 00:28:05,549
That's great

228
00:28:05,637 --> 00:28:06,979
What the fuck was that?

229
00:28:20,486 --> 00:28:22,864
I though you said sound
doesn't travel down here

230
00:28:23,312 --> 00:28:25,312
It doesn't. Stay here

231
00:28:36,462 --> 00:28:38,673
I get it

232
00:28:39,141 --> 00:28:41,974
The guys are just trying to
scare you. They live for that shit

233
00:28:42,325 --> 00:28:44,466
Bye! Fuck off!

234
00:28:44,576 --> 00:28:46,138
Carolyn, I wanna
go home. Please

235
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:50,520
Wait! Wait!
Can you feel that?

236
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:52,317
What?

237
00:28:53,024 --> 00:28:56,213
The music in my feet. The bass.
We're almost back to the party

238
00:28:56,214 --> 00:28:57,598
C'mon! Dance with me

239
00:28:59,669 --> 00:29:01,497
What happened? Turn on the
light! What happened?

240
00:29:01,547 --> 00:29:03,325
- Why it went out?
- The batteries must be dead!

241
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:04,333
- Hang on!
- What?

242
00:29:04,334 --> 00:29:05,789
What do you mean
they're dying?

243
00:29:06,118 --> 00:29:08,505
Batteries die.
The light starts to glimmer

244
00:29:08,555 --> 00:29:11,132
Oh my God!
What we got here?

245
00:29:11,434 --> 00:29:14,063
- The flashlight is dying!
- It's ok!

246
00:29:14,301 --> 00:29:16,063
No it's not. The batteries
are dying

247
00:29:16,869 --> 00:29:18,014
You're such a spaz!

248
00:29:18,094 --> 00:29:19,884
Oh my God!
What are we gonna do?

249
00:29:22,267 --> 00:29:24,921
Why they still doing that?
It's not funny!

250
00:29:25,195 --> 00:29:26,703
You can't be my sister
You had to be adopted

251
00:29:26,753 --> 00:29:28,531
All I wanna say is how
can you be so calm right now?

252
00:29:28,754 --> 00:29:30,436
Because of the first rule
on the Catacombs

253
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:33,027
Always brings more
than one light source

254
00:29:41,556 --> 00:29:43,859
Do you see, spaz?
Not everything is a crisis

255
00:29:44,705 --> 00:29:46,170
C'mon. The party is closer

256
00:30:03,346 --> 00:30:04,656
Carolyn!

257
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,276
Carolyn!

258
00:30:22,434 --> 00:30:25,394
Carolyn! No!

259
00:30:36,449 --> 00:30:38,080
Carolyn! please!

260
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,479
Please!

261
00:30:55,419 --> 00:30:57,245
Help!

262
00:30:59,135 --> 00:31:00,329
Help me!

263
00:31:13,406 --> 00:31:14,368
Help!

264
00:31:33,255 --> 00:31:36,660
No!

265
00:31:39,808 --> 00:31:40,959
My God

266
00:31:41,408 --> 00:31:42,948
Please, light

267
00:31:44,217 --> 00:31:45,900
Please, light. Please, light

268
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,630
Please...

269
00:31:47,992 --> 00:31:49,697
Please, please, please...

270
00:31:57,695 --> 00:31:59,367
C'mon, c'mon...

271
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,779
Help me!

272
00:32:32,313 --> 00:32:33,645
No!

273
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:41,328
Leave me alone!
Noooooo!

274
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,415
Leave me alone!

275
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,604
Help!

276
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:48,053
Hello?

277
00:35:48,054 --> 00:35:49,491
Help!

278
00:35:51,491 --> 00:35:52,337
Hello!
Can anybody hear me?

279
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:53,917
Can anybody hear me?

280
00:36:10,471 --> 00:36:14,211
Oh, not!

281
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:18,555
Leave me alone!

282
00:36:30,373 --> 00:36:32,131
Help me!

283
00:36:34,667 --> 00:36:37,963
Help me!

284
00:36:46,763 --> 00:36:48,032
Help me!

285
00:36:48,983 --> 00:36:49,823
Help me!

286
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:51,491
Help!

287
00:36:51,846 --> 00:36:53,485
Fuck!

288
00:36:53,748 --> 00:36:55,896
He's trying to kill me!

289
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:02,699
Heeeeelp!

290
00:37:04,792 --> 00:37:06,057
Help me!

291
00:37:07,402 --> 00:37:09,530
Somebody help me!

292
00:37:12,173 --> 00:37:14,482
Somebody help me!

293
00:37:49,866 --> 00:37:51,136
Help!

294
00:37:58,193 --> 00:37:59,728
Victoria!

295
00:38:02,986 --> 00:38:04,954
Victoria!

296
00:38:05,273 --> 00:38:07,970
Jean-Michele! Jean-Michele!

297
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:19,656
Jean-Michele

298
00:38:21,267 --> 00:38:23,215
Jean-Michele...!

299
00:40:03,047 --> 00:40:04,101
She's dead!

300
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,976
Oh no!

301
00:42:09,066 --> 00:42:10,708
Hello?

302
00:42:22,845 --> 00:42:24,405
Anybody?

303
00:42:28,111 --> 00:42:29,701
Is anybody there?

304
00:44:09,681 --> 00:44:13,563
Can anybody hear me? I'm
down here! Can anybody hear me?

305
00:44:13,889 --> 00:44:16,451
Can anybody hear me?
I'm caught in here!

306
00:44:26,394 --> 00:44:28,616
Can anybody hear me?
I'm here!

307
00:45:05,115 --> 00:45:07,576
61... 62... 63...

308
00:45:07,917 --> 00:45:10,276
...64... 65...

309
00:45:10,549 --> 00:45:12,383
...83... 84...

310
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,124
...85... 86...

311
00:45:15,927 --> 00:45:17,732
...91... 92...

312
00:45:18,042 --> 00:45:20,883
...93... 94... 95...

313
00:45:22,402 --> 00:45:24,626
...102... 103... 104...

314
00:45:45,012 --> 00:45:48,620
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

315
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:51,703
...6, 7, 8, 9, 10...

316
00:49:01,197 --> 00:49:03,344
Hello!

317
00:49:04,453 --> 00:49:07,725
Can anybody hear me
up there?

318
00:49:41,785 --> 00:49:45,067
Somebody please help me!

319
00:50:00,386 --> 00:50:01,624
Help!

320
00:50:05,712 --> 00:50:07,041
Help me!

321
00:50:09,177 --> 00:50:11,059
Help!

322
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:40,930
I don't understand what
you're saying!

323
00:50:42,216 --> 00:50:44,456
Stay there!
Stay there!

324
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,965
Don't come near me!
Stay there!

325
00:50:48,247 --> 00:50:50,206
Stop were you are!

326
00:50:51,872 --> 00:50:53,761
Don't come near me!
Don't!

327
00:50:54,005 --> 00:50:55,113
I don't understand!

328
00:50:55,711 --> 00:50:59,809
Wait! I can't understand you.
I can't understand you. What?

329
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:03,600
C'est bloqué! C'est bloqué!
Bloqué! Bloqué!

330
00:51:03,891 --> 00:51:05,691
- The exit?
- Bloqué.

331
00:51:05,718 --> 00:51:07,138
- It's blocked?
- Bloqué.

332
00:51:07,188 --> 00:51:08,808
No shit, asshole!

333
00:51:10,469 --> 00:51:12,257
Hey, that's my flashlight, asshole!

334
00:51:34,835 --> 00:51:38,844
Wait! I can't see!

335
00:51:40,459 --> 00:51:43,258
You can't just steal somebody's
flashlight. You jerk!

336
00:51:45,113 --> 00:51:46,035
Wait!

337
00:51:49,113 --> 00:51:52,093
Do you know where you're going?
Do you know where you're going?

338
00:51:55,277 --> 00:51:57,010
You have to be careful

339
00:51:57,844 --> 00:51:59,981
Are you listening to me?

340
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:05,881
What is that?

341
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:07,724
Is that a map?

342
00:52:08,991 --> 00:52:11,722
- Plan. Oui.
- A "plan" of this place?

343
00:52:12,383 --> 00:52:13,732
Let me see

344
00:52:16,186 --> 00:52:19,724
It's a street map. Up there.
A street map

345
00:52:19,725 --> 00:52:20,820
It's moi!

346
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,312
For God's sake. Stop that!

347
00:52:28,002 --> 00:52:30,167
Rue Saint Medard?
What? So...?

348
00:52:35,014 --> 00:52:38,898
Hey, stop! Hello?

349
00:52:40,477 --> 00:52:42,565
You know what you're doing?

350
00:52:56,836 --> 00:53:01,645
These are the same as above on the
street level. The same intersections?

351
00:53:02,924 --> 00:53:05,449
Sortie.

352
00:53:07,329 --> 00:53:08,749
- There's another exit.
- Oui. Oui.

353
00:53:10,261 --> 00:53:12,044
Where are we?

354
00:53:18,056 --> 00:53:21,222
- Sortie!
- Oh, my God. That's so far!

355
00:53:28,031 --> 00:53:30,665
So what happened?

356
00:53:33,937 --> 00:53:38,793
Were... Were you at the party?
Were you at the party?

357
00:53:41,322 --> 00:53:43,489
Did you get lost, too?

358
00:53:47,433 --> 00:53:50,869
Hey!
Could you wait up?

359
00:53:51,283 --> 00:53:53,912
- Attention!
- Please, slow down a little

360
00:53:55,935 --> 00:53:55,976
Please, slow down

361
00:54:18,459 --> 00:54:20,254
Don't touch me!

362
00:54:20,255 --> 00:54:22,442
D'accord!

363
00:54:34,669 --> 00:54:39,712
You're going too fast
I can't see anything

364
00:55:17,946 --> 00:55:18,861
Hey!

365
00:55:20,002 --> 00:55:20,893
Wait!

366
00:55:22,506 --> 00:55:23,973
Where do you going?

367
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:28,128
What are you doing?

368
00:55:32,484 --> 00:55:34,078
Why are we st...?

369
00:55:35,545 --> 00:55:38,428
Why are we stopping?
We have to keep going

370
00:55:45,385 --> 00:55:47,034
What are you hiding?

371
00:55:47,084 --> 00:55:48,628
What is that?

372
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:50,963
Get away from me!
Don't touch me!

373
00:55:51,013 --> 00:55:53,160
What are you doing?

374
00:55:53,687 --> 00:55:57,097
What are you doing? Don't
touch me! Get away from me!

375
00:55:58,557 --> 00:56:00,569
Get away from me!

376
00:56:03,847 --> 00:56:07,312
You're fucking hysterical

00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,493
Henri

00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:53,453

385
00:57:00,501 --> 00:57:01,467
Victoria

386
00:57:21,528 --> 00:57:24,350
My sister died yesterday

387
00:57:30,515 --> 00:57:32,846
At least I think

388
00:57:35,081 --> 00:57:36,315

00:58:00,396 --> 00:58:01,454

00:58:10,674 --> 00:58:11,348
Henri?

392
00:58:15,145 --> 00:58:17,389

393
00:58:19,074 --> 00:58:22,532
Henri, goddamned you!

394
00:58:24,555 --> 00:58:28,178
Henri! Don't

395
00:58:29,415 --> 00:58:30,949
I'll die here!

396
00:58:38,964 --> 00:58:41,262
Where the fuck did you go?

397
00:58:43,726 --> 00:58:45,691

398
00:58:45,692 --> 00:58:51,037
No. No, no, no, no
Tu fais pa. Tu fais pa

00:58:59,411 --> 00:59:02,891
Fucking dick!
Get off me!

401
00:59:04,721 --> 00:59:07,811
- Mon Dieu!
- C'mon, Henri. Get lost!

402
00:59:07,892 --> 00:59:09,525
- We've to find the other exit

403
00:59:09,526 --> 00:59:11,444
- Remember?
- Victoria?

404
00:59:15,992 --> 00:59:18,471
Henri watch out
Be careful

405
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:27,125
Pay attention, Henri

406
00:59:28,062 --> 00:59:30,588
Slowly
Be careful

407
00:59:57,363 --> 00:59:58,450
Are you ok?

408
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:09,251
Henri! Henri!

409
01:00:13,548 --> 01:00:15,361
Oh my God!
Oh my God!

410
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,772
Is gonna be okay

411
01:00:26,494 --> 01:00:30,005
Henri! Give me your hand!
Give me your hand, please!

412
01:00:30,055 --> 01:00:34,198

Alright, alright...

415
01:00:40,725 --> 01:00:44,020
One, two, three... Go!

416
01:01:03,058 --> 01:01:05,140
Don't look at it!
Look at me!

417
01:01:05,634 --> 01:01:07,824
Henri!

418
01:01:08,872 --> 01:01:10,971
C'mon!

419
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:14,901
You can do it! C'mon!

420
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:23,809
Ok! Come here!
Pull! C'mon!

421
01:01:24,175 --> 01:01:27,679
You have to pull harder!
Please!

422
01:01:57,655 --> 01:01:58,857
Ok...

423
01:02:01,399 --> 01:02:03,408
Henri, we're going to try
with two hands now. Ok?

424
01:02:03,409 --> 01:02:04,938
Two hands

425
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:08,699
C'mon, Henri!

426
01:02:14,685 --> 01:02:16,589
Victoria?

427
01:02:20,155 --> 01:02:23,089
I'm sorry. I'm sorry

428
01:02:23,893 --> 01:02:27,542
No, I'm sorry. I'm gonna find
the exit and I'll come back

429
01:02:27,894 --> 01:02:30,129
I swear! Stay where
you are! I'm gonna come back!

430
01:02:30,472 --> 01:02:33,211
I promise you that I will return
I promise it to you

431
01:02:33,562 --> 01:02:35,773
No! Victoria!

432
01:02:35,823 --> 01:02:40,212
Victoria! No!
Merde!

433
01:03:46,788 --> 01:03:49,416
I think I got turn around somehow

434
01:03:50,835 --> 01:03:52,207
Henri?

435
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:10,226
Jesus!

436
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:54,941
Hello?

437
01:10:08,666 --> 01:10:09,667
Hello?

438
01:14:50,467 --> 01:14:53,925
Leave me alone!

439
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:31,960
Fuck! Stay on!
Stay on! Stay on!

440
01:15:49,895 --> 01:15:52,967
You need to be strong!

441
01:15:53,444 --> 01:15:55,963
Please! Don't die!
Don't die!

442
01:15:56,293 --> 01:15:58,959
Turn on! Turn on!
Don't die!

443
01:15:59,927 --> 01:16:01,484
Don't die!

444
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:07,507
Don't die!
Turn on... Please!

445
01:16:08,557 --> 01:16:12,202
Please, just stay on.
Back on! Don't die!

446
01:16:48,488 --> 01:16:50,188
Victoria?

447
01:16:52,370 --> 01:16:55,505
- I knew it. My sister...
- Man, I'm hungry...

448
01:16:55,506 --> 01:16:57,910
- Can we go eat?
- You really thought I was dead?

449
01:17:07,253 --> 01:17:09,903
That's histerical

450
01:17:09,953 --> 01:17:13,606
You really thought I was
dead this whole time. Didn't you?

451
01:17:15,386 --> 01:17:19,507
I knew it! Oh my God...

452
01:17:20,030 --> 01:17:22,025
That's histerical!

453
01:17:23,118 --> 01:17:26,178
You thought I was really
dead this whole time. Didn't you?

454
01:17:28,282 --> 01:17:31,432
We fake the slash
It's stage blood

455
01:17:35,441 --> 01:17:37,919
There's no monster, it was just
a prank.

456
01:17:37,969 --> 01:17:40,398
It was Hugo on a mask.
Will you show her?

457
01:17:40,448 --> 01:17:43,896
Look. Do you see?

458
01:17:51,348 --> 01:17:53,022
It was just a joke

459
01:17:53,442 --> 01:17:55,267
A joke?

460
01:17:55,317 --> 01:17:59,233
Not a joke.
A prank, an initiation

461
01:17:59,507 --> 01:18:02,628
The cult of the Black Virgin.
The monster on the goat mask...

462
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:05,749
...it's just an underground haunted
house meant to scary us fast

463
01:18:05,799 --> 01:18:08,100
This guys is been doing it for years

464
01:18:08,118 --> 01:18:10,297
We're gonna explain everything
but the cops showed up...

465
01:18:10,347 --> 01:18:13,000
...and raid us and separated us

466
01:18:13,001 --> 01:18:15,498
It's been safer for you
be down there, sis.

467
01:18:15,499 --> 01:18:17,356
We've been call you for hours

468
01:18:22,569 --> 01:18:23,932
Hello?

469
01:18:25,121 --> 01:18:27,183
Victoria! Stop running!

470
01:18:27,738 --> 01:18:29,148
Victoria!

471
01:18:31,581 --> 01:18:32,882
Victoria!

472
01:18:37,328 --> 01:18:41,412
It's the walls.
You can't hear nothing

473
01:18:41,725 --> 01:18:43,154
Leave alone me!

474
01:18:44,226 --> 01:18:49,173
No...
My God. Henri!

475
01:18:55,906 --> 01:18:59,885
Hey, stop being such a
drama queen

476
01:18:59,925 --> 01:19:01,853
We kill him!

477
01:19:02,195 --> 01:19:06,682
No, we shouldn't did what we did.
But that what's these guys do

478
01:19:07,859 --> 01:19:11,383
Every single moment of your life is
into scaring shit out of people?

479
01:19:11,433 --> 01:19:13,340
Didn't you see a ghost yet?

480
01:19:13,390 --> 01:19:15,387
They just trying to scare you.
They live for that shit

481
01:19:15,437 --> 01:19:17,349
We thought it would be for you

482
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:18,812
Hey!

483
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:20,379
You scared me!

484
01:19:20,429 --> 01:19:23,650
Good. People like you
need to be scared

485
01:19:23,859 --> 01:19:26,790
There's not homicidal maniac
lurking in every shadow

486
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:30,114
Jean-Michele always says when
you survive your own death, you reborn

487
01:19:30,164 --> 01:19:32,067
Is the whole reason we
come down to the Catacombs

488
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:37,203
Only with the conscious awareness
of our pending death...

489
01:19:37,253 --> 01:19:39,946
...can we appreciate our lifes fully

490
01:19:39,952 --> 01:19:42,794
Why do you think I wanted you
to came here in the first place?

491
01:19:42,941 --> 01:19:44,633
I thought it will help you
to get over your issues...

492
01:19:44,634 --> 01:19:47,530
...to get rid of those stupid
pills once and for all

493
01:19:50,312 --> 01:19:52,704
- Where is Jean-Michele?
- I don't know

494
01:19:53,032 --> 01:19:54,329
Have you seen him?

495
01:19:59,244 --> 01:20:04,294
- Merde, qui est qu'il est Ià?
- Holy shit! Jean-Michele!

496
01:20:04,451 --> 01:20:08,313
God! Oh my God!
Stop shaking him!

497
01:20:08,801 --> 01:20:10,513
Is he dead?

498
01:20:10,741 --> 01:20:12,430
- Jean-Michele!
- God!

499
01:20:13,583 --> 01:20:16,058
Get of him!
Stop shaking him!

500
01:20:17,099 --> 01:20:18,999
No, no, not
Jean-Michele! No!

501
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,395
Check his pulse!

502
01:20:24,078 --> 01:20:25,640
Jean-Michele!

503
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:27,830
How fucking this could happen?

504
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:33,923
Jean-Michele!

505
01:20:39,093 --> 01:20:41,061
No... no...

506
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:47,966
You stupid, fucking cunt!

507
01:20:48,922 --> 01:20:52,001
His dead! How you could
to be so fucking stupid?

508
01:20:52,051 --> 01:20:55,081
What's going on in that
stupid head of yours?

509
01:20:55,664 --> 01:20:59,304
Look what you fucking did!
Get up and look what you did!

510
01:20:59,565 --> 01:21:02,952
Look what you did!
Look what you fucking did!

511
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:04,820
- I'm sorry
- Stupid fucking bitch!

512
01:21:04,870 --> 01:21:06,190
I fucking hate you!

513
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:08,322
Everything you ever done in your
fucking life is a mistake

514
01:21:08,323 --> 01:21:10,639
You're sorry?
Always fucking sorry!

515
01:21:10,689 --> 01:21:15,704
You ruined everything!
I fucking hate you so much!

516
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:17,745
Look what you did!
There's something wrong with you!

517
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:19,785
Look what you did
you fucking idiot!

518
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:22,803
I wish you were dead! You're so
stupid you couldn't even kill yourself!

519
01:21:22,853 --> 01:21:26,270
What is fucking wrong with you?
You stupid... Everywhere...

520
01:21:26,271 --> 01:21:31,465
You should kill yourself...
Crazy stupid bitch!

521
01:21:31,466 --> 01:21:32,535
Everything you...

522
01:21:39,524 --> 01:21:41,688
Nooooo!

523
01:22:23,778 --> 01:22:26,141
My sister sent me a postcard

524
01:22:26,335 --> 01:22:31,129
All it said was: "Come to Paris
It'll be good for you"

525
01:22:35,657 --> 01:22:38,253
48 hours after I arrived...

526
01:22:39,072 --> 01:22:41,588
She and everyone I've
met were dead

527
01:23:25,888 --> 01:23:28,379
Airport, please
