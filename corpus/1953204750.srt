- I still change your mind.
- No, you do not need.

339
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,800
Are you ready, are you?

340
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,100
911 Emergency <i>.</i>

341
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,300
- What do you think? Quite inspiring?
- I!

342
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,600
Thank you.

343
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,000
- May I steal?
- It's yours.

344
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,799
Can szalszázni?

345
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:28,300
- Do you think?
- Okay, let's see whether you can keep up with.

346
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,800
Oh, it was good.

347
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,100
You did well.

348
00:41:27,161 --> 00:41:29,180
Not bad.

349
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,600
I like it here.

350
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,601
- Not exactly a luxury hotel.
- No, that's right. You're lucky.

351
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:49,801
Lucky? ♪lt would have been
growing up in such a place.

352
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,000
I grew up in hotels.

353
00:41:53,501 --> 00:41:56,300
We look different, but are all the same.

354
00:41:56,401 --> 00:41:58,900
A clean, sterile, temporary.

355
00:42:00,723 --> 00:42:02,723
Here people really live.

356
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:06,567
It's beautiful.

357
00:42:09,998 --> 00:42:12,966
- I love it.
- Want to see more?

358
00:42:18,977 --> 00:42:22,307
- It's your boat?
- No, but I can take you for a ride.

359
00:42:44,068 --> 00:42:49,091
- When you bring up the band?
- Eddy's idea of ​​the band.

360
00:42:49,968 --> 00:42:52,807
- How long have you know each other?
- Ever since I can eat.

361
00:42:52,908 --> 00:42:55,103
We're practically brothers.

362
00:42:55,104 --> 00:42:58,832
Ricky's parents went to the
restaurant every night.

363
00:42:58,833 --> 00:43:03,125
Played with, which we knew.

364
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:11,522
Then my father left us.

365
00:43:13,154 --> 00:43:18,334
My mother remarried. Since
then, the family's modest.

366
00:43:20,772 --> 00:43:25,682
It was here, after mother left my father.

367
00:43:25,683 --> 00:43:30,123
- My father and I were inseparable.
- And what happened?

368
00:43:33,029 --> 00:43:39,896
Created their own ideas
that you wish to access.

369
00:43:40,531 --> 00:43:43,684
It is very difficult to accept my views.

370
00:43:44,825 --> 00:43:48,825
- You should do what you want.
- It's not that simple.

371
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:53,399
- Why?
- Not you, Sean!

372
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,593
I want to be like you. I do what I want.

373
00:43:59,469 --> 00:44:02,290
- To break the rules.
- Like me?

374
00:44:02,735 --> 00:44:08,552
Real life is. Eddy with what
we are invisible in the city.

375
00:44:10,705 --> 00:44:13,750
Therefore, we started to
do the demonstrations.

376
00:44:15,777 --> 00:44:18,927
This helps you to have a listen.

377
00:44:20,118 --> 00:44:23,258
We exist. The city is ours.

378
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:35,153
- Find embarrassing?
- I do not. Not at all!

379
00:45:51,598 --> 00:45:53,220
Hey, Ricky!

380
00:45:58,208 --> 00:46:00,070
What has happened?

381
00:46:00,522 --> 00:46:03,948
Ever heard of Global Properties
of the Anderson company?

382
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:07,190
Yes. Why?

383
00:46:08,577 --> 00:46:12,737
That guy is Anderson doing some improvements.

384
00:46:12,738 --> 00:46:15,945
Luxury hotels, fancy shops...

385
00:46:15,946 --> 00:46:19,370
Buying the coast on this side of the river.

386
00:46:19,371 --> 00:46:22,731
This is a bar, a house, a shop,
where your sister is working...

387
00:46:22,832 --> 00:46:27,301
All is lost. Named "El Frente del Rio".

388
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:32,772
Can you believe it? This is the
same garbage, he fired me.

389
00:46:34,623 --> 00:46:38,680
You have no right to come here
and take away everything.

390
00:46:40,827 --> 00:46:43,398
- You can not oppose that?
- That's not my decision.

391
00:46:43,399 --> 00:46:47,157
The space is rented, just like everyone else.

392
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:53,599
Many people here live on.

393
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,857
Now all burn. Everything!

394
00:47:07,165 --> 00:47:08,887
Emily!

395
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:14,237
- Where are you going?
- Talk to my dad.

396
00:47:14,238 --> 00:47:17,125
- It can help you?
- I do not know, but we must try.

397
00:47:17,326 --> 00:47:20,723
We have to tell your friends to my father.
They deserve it.

398
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,400
I do not know. Eddy has
little to lose and control.

399
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:27,865
Ricky and I have not seen him like this.
Just pouring oil on the fire.

400
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:40,371
Can you tell me where you've been?

401
00:47:41,351 --> 00:47:44,704
I went with a friend and was too late.

402
00:47:45,005 --> 00:47:47,007
That is an unknown boy spend the night?

403
00:47:47,008 --> 00:47:50,900
- There was no ur.
- Just do not repeat!

404
00:47:50,962 --> 00:47:52,679
I have an appointment.

405
00:47:53,813 --> 00:47:56,973
New investment in boot from Spring Garden?

406
00:47:58,965 --> 00:48:00,741
Why do you ask?

407
00:48:04,479 --> 00:48:09,719
- My friend, Sean, lives there.
- It's getting better!

408
00:48:09,754 --> 00:48:13,256
- In the dirt you spend the night?
- No thanks!

409
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:17,303
Dad, you should see! The same
families living there for decades.

410
00:48:17,304 --> 00:48:20,032
Every time I build something,
something must be destroyed.

411
00:48:20,033 --> 00:48:23,089
Someone's house or business.
This is the price of progress.

412
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:28,004
The transaction is complete. Negotiating
with the city council next Thursday.

413
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:31,733
Should have given their blessing to it, at
the end of the month we start the work.

414
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:35,583
- Please, do not do it!
- Agree!

415
00:48:35,784 --> 00:48:38,045
I will not say it, how to dance...

416
00:48:40,205 --> 00:48:42,757
You do not say... it's the company management.

417
00:48:53,772 --> 00:48:55,859
Five-minute break, girls.

418
00:48:59,249 --> 00:49:00,778
Emily...

419
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:05,886
- Where are you?
- Here I am. Just...

420
00:49:05,946 --> 00:49:07,570
You're not here!

421
00:49:08,848 --> 00:49:15,848
When I look at you, I see a
leaf floating in the studio.

422
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:23,998
Take control, Emily!

423
00:49:26,201 --> 00:49:28,457
From the beginning again!

424
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,820
Where have you been?

425
00:49:41,255 --> 00:49:43,738
Emily has an idea for the next dance.

426
00:49:44,562 --> 00:49:49,773
Just what was missing to come
mgmondja Cinderella and what to do.

427
00:49:50,001 --> 00:49:53,918
The next dance would work. We
are looking at over 4 million.

428
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:57,244
And what if the size of the YouTube audience?

429
00:49:57,545 --> 00:50:00,538
You know you can win the race, made money,

430
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:03,851
but it will not change anything. Believe me.

431
00:50:06,205 --> 00:50:08,830
There are 4 million people who watch you,

432
00:50:08,831 --> 00:50:11,646
but not fully disclose anything important.

433
00:50:11,647 --> 00:50:14,193
I do not have it as long that you enjoy doing,

434
00:50:14,194 --> 00:50:16,616
and not away with you if you break the law.

435
00:50:16,617 --> 00:50:18,333
And what do you suggest?

436
00:50:18,334 --> 00:50:23,901
Enough with the art showból.
Getting into the art of protest!

437
00:50:25,979 --> 00:50:29,492
The plans show a week in the local government.

438
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:32,865
The council must approve the start.

439
00:50:33,066 --> 00:50:37,306
- I think you should skip.
- You want to break the meeting?

440
00:50:39,267 --> 00:50:42,641
- I'm in!
- How do you know this?

441
00:50:45,743 --> 00:50:48,343
The city council shall be public.

442
00:50:49,059 --> 00:50:52,379
And the development of a
technology and the Internet.

443
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,439
Well said.

444
00:50:56,989 --> 00:51:02,647
Think about it. Instead
of a hunt scene, we hear.

445
00:51:05,761 --> 00:51:08,925
Okay, I'm listening. What's the plan?

446
00:51:11,781 --> 00:51:14,147
More dancers need.

447
00:51:16,883 --> 00:51:19,421
<i>Sit down, gentlemen.</i>

448
00:51:19,422 --> 00:51:22,495
<i>Thank you for being here.</i>

449
00:51:22,903 --> 00:51:24,897
We are excited about the show because.

450
00:51:24,898 --> 00:51:29,070
Ladies and Gentlemen, this is Bob Cooper.
Cooper and Mackie from

451
00:51:29,071 --> 00:51:31,996
One of the largest marketing
company Egyeült States.

452
00:51:32,386 --> 00:51:34,927
<i>Bob agreed to come in person...</i>

453
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:40,339
Immediately <i> present a more detailed plan.</i>

454
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:45,613
First of all we would like to draw your
attention to our plans for coastal restoration.

455
00:51:52,108 --> 00:51:53,633
Okay...

456
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:57,740
I think we should go...

457
00:52:02,164 --> 00:52:05,254
I apologize. I do not know
whether this practice.

458
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:08,400
We find out what the problem is.

459
00:52:08,601 --> 00:52:11,842
Then visszemegyünk the meeting.

460
00:52:12,143 --> 00:52:14,225
Nice tie.

461
00:53:44,339 --> 00:53:46,444
What the hell is going on here, Trip?

462
00:54:47,667 --> 00:54:49,618
What is the purpose of this?

463
00:56:16,828 --> 00:56:20,362
- I should fear this band?
- I do not.

464
00:56:21,445 --> 00:56:23,553
Only stupid kids.

465
00:56:24,113 --> 00:56:26,569
Just some stupid kids have?

466
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:29,776
Yeah

467
00:56:31,217 --> 00:56:33,823
<i>flashmob was designed to disrupt a meeting</i>

468
00:56:33,824 --> 00:56:36,925
<i>the Regional Council and
Global Properties in Anderson.</i>

469
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:38,877
Look, Mom! The Sean!

470
00:56:39,439 --> 00:56:43,945
- Are you sure?
- Yes! Motion of the ocean does.

471
00:56:47,855 --> 00:56:51,327
It appears in the video as a virus spreads

472
00:56:51,328 --> 00:56:55,943
transforming these cultural
támogatókká officials.

473
00:57:01,310 --> 00:57:04,991
Sean! You will not believe it.

474
00:57:05,518 --> 00:57:08,659
1 million visitor is still less than 2 hours.

475
00:57:10,489 --> 00:57:12,940
We have 6 million viewers.

476
00:57:17,815 --> 00:57:20,384
<i>- You will like the following news...
- I just saw the video.</i>

477
00:57:20,385 --> 00:57:24,635
<i>I can tell you it's amazing!</i>

478
00:57:24,736 --> 00:57:27,647
<i>The video on YouTube as a virus spreads.</i>

479
00:57:27,648 --> 00:57:30,345
<i>These mysterious artists has moved on.</i>

480
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:32,484
<i>...wonders of the internet were very soon.</i>

481
00:57:32,485 --> 00:57:36,402
Before <i> announce the winner, they saw...</i>

482
00:57:36,403 --> 00:57:39,324
<i>- This is sensational!
- More news...</i>

483
00:57:39,325 --> 00:57:40,926
<i>seems to continue to grow.</i>

484
00:57:40,927 --> 00:57:45,061
Everyone's talking about it, so I
ask: who has not heard of this band?

485
00:57:49,131 --> 00:57:54,399
- This is the fourth of everything.
- I was born and live... Not emgyünk it.

486
00:57:54,434 --> 00:57:58,968
What have you done for me... and for
my family, the other family are...

487
00:57:59,016 --> 00:58:02,477
Gave voice to our concerns.
We are grateful for it.

488
00:58:02,478 --> 00:58:05,674
- I do not know what to say... Thank you!
- We are very grateful!

489
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:09,166
These movements cause all
kinds of problems in Miami.

490
00:58:09,167 --> 00:58:12,721
Many celebrities on Twitter you say...

491
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:18,068
- Have you seen the video with the kids...
- Dance is a universal language.

492
00:58:18,069 --> 00:58:22,121
8-10 million views! We are number one!

493
00:58:24,151 --> 00:58:28,645
The community side of the band,
Anderson lost his support.

494
00:58:28,646 --> 00:58:32,411
The Council's latest survey showed
that if you do not vote for,

495
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:35,572
Anderson does not approve the plan.

496
00:59:46,384 --> 00:59:50,132
Thumbs up! That's right, Emily!

497
00:59:59,426 --> 01:00:02,491
Do not hurry! Okay!

498
01:00:09,112 --> 01:00:10,916
It takes shape.

499
01:00:17,813 --> 01:00:19,464
I like it!

500
01:00:19,665 --> 01:00:24,405
Do not worry, you can do the test.

501
01:00:24,706 --> 01:00:27,314
I am grateful for the help.

502
01:00:35,697 --> 01:00:40,722
- Did he say anything to your father?
- No, but I think it worked.

503
01:00:41,333 --> 01:00:43,761
Bad it would be if he knew I was there.

504
01:00:43,762 --> 01:00:48,082
I do not feel bad for having sabotaged
the expansion of your father?

505
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:56,923
Asserting that the terrible and greedy
father, stealing their neighborhood?

506
01:01:00,163 --> 01:01:02,389
Yes, I feel guilty.

507
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:08,197
But as much as I love my father,
sure to find a different location.

508
01:01:08,609 --> 01:01:11,705
Happy, believe me.

509
01:01:12,908 --> 01:01:17,893
- What is your relationship?
- You have to go to a full-Ball.

510
01:01:19,001 --> 01:01:21,023
Trip asked me to be his partner.

511
01:01:22,493 --> 01:01:25,032
You think you can get closer to my father.

512
01:01:25,033 --> 01:01:28,693
As you can imagine, that I refused.
'd Like you to come with me.

513
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:35,222
Of course, I'll be there. Just on the
other side of the table, tray in hand.

514
01:01:35,223 --> 01:01:37,617
- Even rehearsed?
- I do not.

515
01:01:37,618 --> 01:01:40,592
- Only one?
- I do not think I have the time.

516
01:01:41,926 --> 01:01:44,497
- Come on!
- No!

517
01:01:49,237 --> 01:01:51,751
- Can I come in?
- Yes.

518
01:01:56,914 --> 01:02:00,025
- To go to the dance?
- Good.

519
01:02:00,026 --> 01:02:02,903
After 2 days will be the final test.

520
01:02:04,924 --> 01:02:07,553
- Good luck!
- Thank you.

521
01:02:10,356 --> 01:02:12,707
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

522
01:02:14,735 --> 01:02:19,756
I've had two difficult. I'm
glad that you're here for me.

523
01:02:19,757 --> 01:02:24,232
Emily and her father, against the world!
Is it true?

524
01:02:25,571 --> 01:02:26,871
Yep.

525
01:02:30,331 --> 01:02:34,298
I'll let you sleep. Good night, my dear!

526
01:02:35,776 --> 01:02:37,609
Good night, Dad!

527
01:02:43,154 --> 01:02:46,833
I hope that it is important,
otherwise you have somebody veins.

528
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:51,456
- Yo Eddy!
- What's up?

529
01:02:51,657 --> 01:02:53,909
What are you trying to show?

530
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:56,434
- Where's Sean?
- Check it out!

531
01:02:56,835 --> 01:02:59,456
I found the recording próbájukról.

532
01:02:59,665 --> 01:03:05,166
<i>Would be bad if he knew I was there.</i>

533
01:03:05,167 --> 01:03:10,788
<i>Not feel bad for having
sabotaged the expansion father</i>

534
01:03:11,466 --> 01:03:13,835
- What the fuck?
- Googled.

535
01:03:13,836 --> 01:03:17,690
Emily Anderson. With his daughter.

536
01:03:18,091 --> 01:03:19,866
- It's crazy!
- What?

537
01:03:19,867 --> 01:03:24,030
Maybe we should call Sean. Explain what's up.

538
01:03:24,031 --> 01:03:29,385
No! I have a better idea.

539
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:32,638
Anderson's ball organized
by the local council for

540
01:03:39,522 --> 01:03:42,338
- This is a big project.
- I think it will be better for everyone.

541
01:03:42,339 --> 01:03:45,578
Here is my beautiful little girl, I'm sorry.
I'm glad you came.

542
01:03:47,287 --> 01:03:49,587
- You look gorgeous!
- Thanks, Dad!

543
01:03:49,588 --> 01:03:52,400
What do you think? It is true
that Trip did a great job?

544
01:03:53,813 --> 01:03:55,617
In our place we go?

545
01:03:55,618 --> 01:03:58,428
I would like to thank everyone for coming.

546
01:03:58,429 --> 01:04:01,088

Thank you all! And I would like to welcome

555
01:04:46,574 --> 01:04:49,900
I think it's a bit of a technical problem.

556
01:04:50,766 --> 01:04:53,467
Allow the video.

557
01:05:05,532 --> 01:05:07,922
- Call the police!
- I called!

558
01:05:08,026 --> 01:05:09,733
It's time for revenge

ANDERSON GROUP = oppression

562
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:38,714
And the best:

563
01:05:42,818 --> 01:05:45,226
IS is against the girl

<i>Would be bad if he knew I was there.</i>

568
01:06:10,429 --> 01:06:12,348
Mr. Mayor!

569
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:31,523
- What are you doing?
- Which you did not have the courage!

570

Or too occupied döngetése the boss's daughter?

01:06:36,265 --> 01:06:38,454
- Emily!
- You used me!

572
01:06:38,455 --> 01:06:40,735
I swear, I did not know
what she wants Eddy.

573
01:06:40,736 --> 01:06:43,319
Stop it! They can not
do anything without you!

574
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:45,255
- Emily!
- Fuck off!

575
01:07:00,476 --> 01:07:04,836
Sean lied! You lied to us!

576
01:07:04,837 --> 01:07:09,468
It's true. I lied, Eddy. I tried
to protect the girl you like.

577
01:07:09,469 --> 01:07:12,901
- They are timely.
- Shut up!

578
01:07:12,902 --> 01:07:16,730
Morons! You do not know when to stop.

579
01:07:18,066 --> 01:07:20,710
You are all over the news.

580
01:07:23,490 --> 01:07:25,568
We excluded.

581
01:07:25,569 --> 01:07:29,766
- It's impossible! Visit there.
- I received an email from them.

582
01:07:30,238 --> 01:07:32,933
They do not want their
names included in the mix.

583
01:07:32,934 --> 01:07:35,190
- Nonsense!
- Anderson denounced.

584
01:07:35,191 --> 01:07:36,941
We're doomed.

585
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:40,200
We both got a lesson today.

586
01:07:40,201 --> 01:07:43,944
Hell! Apokolba you and go!

587
01:07:43,945 --> 01:07:46,809
It's too late. We get there.

588
01:07:46,810 --> 01:07:50,425
What did you think, what? I
thought his blessing upon you?

589
01:07:50,626 --> 01:07:53,152
You and the princess lived happily ever after?

590
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:58,104
I can not believe that after
you have suffered together,

591
01:07:58,105 --> 01:08:00,138
You choose the lying bitch for me.

592
01:08:00,139 --> 01:08:03,605
I asked them not to tell who the father is.

593
01:08:04,305 --> 01:08:06,625
I knew I was too stubborn to not care.

594
01:08:06,626 --> 01:08:09,100
Perhaps much you think you are,

595
01:08:10,379 --> 01:08:12,871
but he would not do this as you are.

596
01:08:13,397 --> 01:08:16,797
- I'll let you!
- Let go of me, man.

597
01:08:26,477 --> 01:08:29,719
<i>Hi, I'm Emily! Leave a message
and I'll call you back.</i>

598
01:08:30,178 --> 01:08:33,282
<i>'m Sean. You must believe me,</i>

01:08:33,283 --> 01:08:35,778

01:08:35,779 --> 01:08:39,429

601
01:08:40,036 --> 01:08:41,896
<i>You know my number.</i>

602
01:09:03,278 --> 01:09:05,069
I'm sorry.

603
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:09,905
I did not mean to offend you.

604
01:09:17,517 --> 01:09:19,499
Forget it!

605
01:09:20,155 --> 01:09:24,294
The plan was approved, and will soon begin.

606
01:09:44,091 --> 01:09:47,481
- Where's Sean?
- In the morning he took his stuff.

01:09:56,559 --> 01:09:58,528
No new posts <i>.</i>

608
01:10:02,587 --> 01:10:05,881
- Where do I put this box?
- I.

609
01:10:25,542 --> 01:10:27,489
Emily Anderson!

610
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:34,186
I thought you prepare a duet.

611
01:10:35,831 --> 01:10:40,616
I changed my mind. No one will.

612
01:11:50,996 --> 01:11:52,404
Emily!

613
01:11:55,367 --> 01:11:56,806
Emily?

614
01:11:59,102 --> 01:12:00,740
What are you doing here?

615
01:12:06,771 --> 01:12:10,267
I need to know... Failed?

616
01:12:15,034 --> 01:12:18,290
- What are you going to do?
- To meet my promise.

617
01:12:18,391 --> 01:12:23,253
- I'm going to work for my father.
- Do not do this! Do not give up!

618
01:12:23,795 --> 01:12:27,520
But you? When will the next flashmob?

619
01:12:30,573 --> 01:12:35,548
The houses were demolished.
Vágyaidért should fight.

620
01:12:51,927 --> 01:12:54,868
Sean are designed to denote
the first flashmob cent.

621
01:12:55,357 --> 01:12:56,953
Right here.

622
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:01,683
This is anger among you, not good.

623
01:13:02,834 --> 01:13:04,722
Yeah I know. I did not start.

624
01:13:04,799 --> 01:13:07,695
But befejezhetnéd. Just sift the fire.

625
01:13:09,173 --> 01:13:13,288
- I lied to him, Ricky.
- You are young.

626
01:13:13,423 --> 01:13:17,928
Have not met the right girl,
so you do not know what it is.

627
01:13:18,189 --> 01:13:19,923
But one day you'll find him.

628
01:13:19,924 --> 01:13:24,961
And when you find it, do not
lose hope, as your friend.

629
01:13:26,952 --> 01:13:29,242
Go and fix it.

630
01:13:30,221 --> 01:13:32,143
Please.

631
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:42,512
What are you spying on, man?

632
01:13:44,963 --> 01:13:46,481
What is it?

633
01:13:49,313 --> 01:13:53,436
Big mistake and there is no excuse.

634
01:13:53,973 --> 01:13:56,689
It's just... I do not know.

635
01:13:58,103 --> 01:14:02,790
I thought it was you and me
against the world we are.

636
01:14:02,791 --> 01:14:06,886
I began to feel that losing you.
But never mind, it was stupid.

637
01:14:08,259 --> 01:14:09,817
I'm sorry.

638
01:14:11,402 --> 01:14:13,402
Not only is your fault.

639
01:14:14,389 --> 01:14:16,228
You should not have to lie.

640
01:14:16,428 --> 01:14:18,933
So, I got my best friend back?

641
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:24,021
- I do not know. I hope you do not expect a ring?
- Not at all.

642
01:14:24,222 --> 01:14:27,733
I broke one of my teeth, crazy bastard.

643
01:14:27,734 --> 01:14:31,173
From now on, only this
hundreds of times a fist.

644
01:14:33,139 --> 01:14:34,395
Wait!

645
01:14:36,566 --> 01:14:41,516
- Hi, Sean!
- What are you doing?

646
01:14:43,782 --> 01:14:45,551
I'm sorry, bro!

647
01:14:45,852 --> 01:14:49,410
- Mindőnk sorry.
- Yes. The band is not the same without you.

648
01:14:49,645 --> 01:14:56,159
The band and all, a good thing
we did something wrong.

649
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:58,374
Maybe there is way to fix this.

650
01:14:58,575 --> 01:15:02,073
- To get a chance.
- What is.

651
01:15:02,074 --> 01:15:04,473
To achieve our goal of being
the band lértehoztuk.

652
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:06,382
To be heard.

653
01:15:06,716 --> 01:15:08,941
Do not let it stick to a simple tournaments.

654
01:15:08,942 --> 01:15:12,197
You have to give people to
make their voices heard.

655
01:15:12,706 --> 01:15:16,502
The problem is that they need more sound.
Much more.

656
01:15:16,637 --> 01:15:21,284
This will not be a problem. Many
people like to have more than lana.

657
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:23,754
- That's right!
- So you're dealing with.

658
01:15:33,448 --> 01:15:36,197
5,6,7,8 ...!

659
01:15:37,668 --> 01:15:42,661
Warning! Stop! 2 Step down here.

660
01:15:44,399 --> 01:15:46,503

<i>Stand up!</i>

662
01:16:00,587 --> 01:16:04,547
Will wonder if it works.

663
01:16:06,128 --> 01:16:08,355
We need all the help possible.

664
01:16:08,641 --> 01:16:11,362
- Jason! What's up?
- All right! Listen...

665
01:16:11,363 --> 01:16:16,640
I am going to some big one in Miami.
I need some fireworks.

666
01:16:16,641 --> 01:16:19,642
- What do you think?
- Good. What were you thinking?

667
01:16:37,477 --> 01:16:39,106
Figyuzzatok!

668
01:16:40,061 --> 01:16:41,768
Öteletes, right?

669
01:16:42,131 --> 01:16:46,016
Imagine a mass of people who
are doing this more than once.

670
01:16:46,017 --> 01:16:48,444
- What about the costumes?
- I know!

671
01:16:49,521 --> 01:16:53,846
- So, got the costumes?
- Spoken!

672
01:17:17,219 --> 01:17:21,300
You see, my friends, today is our day!

673
01:17:21,301 --> 01:17:24,899
What a beautiful day it is in the area,

674
01:17:25,236 --> 01:17:29,620
prosperity will soon enter a new era.

675
01:17:30,093 --> 01:17:32,663
Thank you!

676
01:17:32,664 --> 01:17:37,443
<i>Hard road led to this, it was a lot of talk...</i>

677
01:17:37,444 --> 01:17:39,582
<i>- I'm glad you're here. -...
some misunderstanding.</i>

678
01:17:39,583 --> 01:17:43,620
Soon we'll go back to Cleveland
and back leave this city.

679
01:17:43,621 --> 01:17:47,785
<i>I am proud to have worked with
my dear friend Bill Anderson,</i>

680
01:17:47,786 --> 01:17:52,278
and offer our cooperation as a symbol of...

681
01:17:54,082 --> 01:17:57,103
...a shovel, which is...
♪What is happening?

682
01:17:57,658 --> 01:18:00,177
I think it's broken. What about it?

683
01:18:00,629 --> 01:18:03,014
- Bastards!
- What happened?

684
01:18:04,263 --> 01:18:07,617
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- What the hell is this?

685
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:10,818
A few weeks ago I asked who this band.

686
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:22,861
The band we are. Miami gang.

687
01:18:22,862 --> 01:18:24,991
And Miami is just as valuable as a culture.

688
01:18:24,992 --> 01:18:28,228
If you destroy a culture, destroy the city.

689
01:18:28,589 --> 01:18:30,768
There is something important to say.

690
01:18:30,969 --> 01:18:34,771
Let us express ourselves in the way we do.

691
01:20:50,102 --> 01:20:52,051
Why did not you do anything?

692
01:22:55,998 --> 01:22:57,265
Yes

693
01:23:47,526 --> 01:23:49,296
Oh, my God!

694
01:25:40,603 --> 01:25:42,995
- We did it!
- Not yet.

695
01:25:42,996 --> 01:25:44,642
There is something else.

696
01:25:53,457 --> 01:25:55,217
Get back!

697
01:26:07,885 --> 01:26:11,756
Come! Do not you think it's time
to fight for what you want?

698
01:26:13,768 --> 01:26:15,170
Emily?

699
01:28:44,016 --> 01:28:46,450
- Bravo!
- Come here!

700
01:29:00,050 --> 01:29:04,099
Andy, my son! I am Robert Alexander "third".

701
01:29:04,100 --> 01:29:05,787
- But you can call me Moose.
- Moose?

702
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:12,126
We saw clearly that this community has to say.

703
01:29:12,441 --> 01:29:15,582
And we came to help, to tell.

704
01:29:15,583 --> 01:29:16,818
Mr. Anderson?

705
01:29:17,329 --> 01:29:20,110
We can not destroy the
quarter megakadályzoni...

706
01:29:22,386 --> 01:29:25,525
We wanted to show you...
but what will odaveszni.

707
01:29:27,295 --> 01:29:30,530
I'm sorry, Bill. The things
do not go as expected.

708
01:29:30,531 --> 01:29:33,202
Right! Because the plan has changed!

709
01:29:34,627 --> 01:29:38,679
Maybe find a way for you to build
on the area, not to destroy it.

710
01:29:41,528 --> 01:29:43,378
What do you think?

711
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:58,000
Why Moose?

712
01:29:59,093 --> 01:30:03,851
The question that should
be asked, why not, Moose?

713
01:30:03,852 --> 01:30:06,175
I told you!

714
01:30:06,556 --> 01:30:09,822
- Sorry!
- Not now, Bob!

715
01:30:10,296 --> 01:30:13,548
I wanted to talk to her, not you.

716
01:30:13,549 --> 01:30:16,175
Bob Cooper, owner of the advertising company,

717
01:30:16,176 --> 01:30:19,219
I hired Mr. Anderson. No offense,

718
01:30:19,220 --> 01:30:22,126
but the greatest of our clients as Nike.

719
01:30:23,384 --> 01:30:25,635
- Yes?
- They are looking for something unique.

720
01:30:25,636 --> 01:30:30,015
Something special for the new campaign.
The team would be your superior.

721
01:30:30,204 --> 01:30:32,558
Are you ready to make the
world get to know the band?

722
01:30:32,962 --> 01:30:35,687
- What do you think?
- What do you think??

723
01:30:35,988 --> 01:30:37,587
Where do I sign?

724
01:30:56,924 --> 01:31:01,086
Look what you did! Brought people together!

725
01:31:04,969 --> 01:31:08,905
You can be vaalki who violate the rules.

726
01:31:10,106 --> 01:31:11,646
I'm in!
