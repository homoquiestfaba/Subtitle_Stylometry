# 3. ALL THAT A PERSON CAN REMEMBER. #

5
00:01:38,168 --> 00:01:40,668
No! No!

6
00:02:04,806 --> 00:02:08,292
As a researcher in the field of
memory loss, I know how daunting

7
00:02:08,324 --> 00:02:11,207
it can be to reach results for
patients with Alzheimer's syndrome.

8
00:02:11,904 --> 00:02:14,404
As someone who's felt the
effects of this disease personally,

9
00:02:14,586 --> 00:02:18,188
I truly understand that
all that matters is life.

10
00:02:18,223 --> 00:02:22,482
And our lives, ladies and gentlemen,
are nothing more than our memories.

11
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,770
Alright, thank you.

12
00:02:27,223 --> 00:02:29,723
I'll be back.

13
00:02:30,744 --> 00:02:34,024
Thought you were over doctors. - I'll be
all over Doctor Mills tonight, trust me.

14
00:02:34,258 --> 00:02:37,658
Yeah, well, I'll be all over my bed. We
got an early start, man, I'm just exhausted.

15
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:41,952
Don't forget to pack your diapers, little
baby.- Look, while I'm working my ass off,

16
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,094
you're flirting with doctors and
checking on your fantasy football team.

17
00:02:45,364 --> 00:02:47,587
That's why I'm always
in the playoffs, baby!

18
00:02:47,588 --> 00:02:50,908
You think you have problems, try being a
single dad. - What are you talking about?

19
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:54,029
What I'm talking about? I'm talking
about I haven't had a decent breakthrough

20
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,230
in over a year and a half, alright?
A year and a half.

21
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,100
I'm touring, I'm speaking on what I ask you.
- Taylor make sense.

22
00:03:02,632 --> 00:03:05,832
Listen, you're trying to do something
good for society as well as for your mom.

23
00:03:06,538 --> 00:03:09,038
Trying to cure a disease takes time.

24
00:03:09,343 --> 00:03:12,383
I look at her, right, and I think in
ten years time, that's going to be me.

25
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,870
Pretty soon I'm not even going to recognize
you. - Hey, you don't know that for sure.

26
00:03:15,871 --> 00:03:18,071
You know, I've got a 50%
chance of having Alzheimer's.

27
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:20,105
Yeah, but you shouldn't
think of it like that.

28
00:03:20,106 --> 00:03:22,830
Come on, you got to live your
life, man! One more shot, Rico!

29
00:03:22,885 --> 00:03:25,385
One more shot, please.

30
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,444
Night Dr. Briggs! You have an
urgent message. It's from the hospital.

31
00:03:31,507 --> 00:03:34,007
Thank you.

32
00:03:37,742 --> 00:03:40,128
I knew you were in
Brazil for the convention.

33
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:42,797
I am Dr. Costas, Head of
Neurology for the hospital.

34
00:03:43,012 --> 00:03:45,732
We got your message. Got here as
soon as we could, and here we are,

35
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:47,879
we don't... not
exactly sure as to why.

36
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:51,520
At first we diagnosed it

37
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,468
as a cerebral hemorrhage.
- Right.

38
00:03:55,341 --> 00:03:57,929
Then the MRis came back.

39
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,575
We've never seen anything like it.
- Really.

40
00:04:01,113 --> 00:04:03,613
Please. Come.

41
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,264
This is Dr. Salvo, the
attending physician.

42
00:04:08,241 --> 00:04:11,663
Who is he?
- We don't know. We think he's American.

43
00:04:14,382 --> 00:04:19,266
What's that on his skin?
- Red ocher. Amazonian Indians up the river,

44
00:04:19,951 --> 00:04:22,328
use it as a tribal body dye.

45
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:26,617
And how can we help? - If you will just take
a look at these scans, you will understand.

46
00:04:33,546 --> 00:04:35,934
As you can see, the
tumors have formed in...

47
00:04:35,935 --> 00:04:40,296
Which area dealing, with memory?
- We would appreciate your input.

48
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:43,083
Did he have anything with him?
- Just that.

49
00:04:56,237 --> 00:05:01,689
What is this substance? - I'm not sure.
He had ingested a great deal of that powder.

50
00:05:02,831 --> 00:05:06,674
When he dies, where will the post mortem
be done? - Due to the unknown condition,

51
00:05:07,145 --> 00:05:09,743
the authorities demand that
we cremate him immediately.

52
00:05:10,131 --> 00:05:12,923
I want to say cancer, but I've...

53
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:20,509
never seen cancer attack
memory centers so selectively.

54
00:05:23,796 --> 00:05:26,734
You ever seen anything like that?
- Never heard of anything like that.

55
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,291
Hey!

56
00:06:55,542 --> 00:06:58,102
Hey!
Stop, would you?

57
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,260
Hey!

58
00:07:26,437 --> 00:07:28,937
Taylor, we're going to
miss this flight, damn it!

59
00:07:29,511 --> 00:07:32,011
What the fuck happened to you?
- I don't know.

60
00:07:32,454 --> 00:07:35,708
You're soaking wet.
- I know. I'm dehydrated.

61
00:07:37,806 --> 00:07:40,541
Did you go out again last night?
- No.

62
00:07:44,942 --> 00:07:47,442
I took a shower.

63
00:07:47,982 --> 00:07:51,614
You bang your head or what?
- God, that all seemed so real.

64
00:07:52,091 --> 00:07:54,591
What was so real?
- I thought I was chasing this guy.

65
00:07:54,648 --> 00:07:58,872
He had a black, Burberry overcoat.
- Burberry. Nice, buddy.

66
00:08:04,274 --> 00:08:06,520
Crap!
- What?

67
00:08:06,521 --> 00:08:08,801
The pow... I'm such and idiot!
The powder, I got that...

68
00:08:08,802 --> 00:08:11,962
It's just... - Fucking powder! - It's
just a rash! - I know man! I got a hole,

69
00:08:11,963 --> 00:08:14,363
We'll miss this flight. - My
club had a rip in it. I got...

70
00:08:14,364 --> 00:08:16,704
Ah shit!
- Come on!

71
00:08:27,484 --> 00:08:30,164
Excuse me, do you know what
happened to the patient that was here?

72
00:08:30,165 --> 00:08:32,266
He die, a few hours ago.

73
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,891
Do you know where Dr. Costas is?
- I'm not sure. I think he's gone.

74
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:45,222
Thank you.

75
00:09:42,077 --> 00:09:44,419
Hey you.
- Oh, hey!

76
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:48,613
How's she doing? - Good, she's been smiling
ever since we started watching 'Jerry'.

77
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,495
Started to watch Jerry?
What else did you watch?

78
00:09:52,946 --> 00:09:58,061
Well, we do crocodile hunters at seven.
Then we shop on QBC for about an hour.

79
00:09:58,302 --> 00:10:02,871
Nice. - Carol dropped of another one of
those crazy study things for you. - Crazy.

80
00:10:03,468 --> 00:10:06,588
Okay, I'll see you later. - Drive safe.
#KEEP AN OPEN MIND THIS TIME, CAROL #

Thank you. Bye. #NEW AGE HERBAL
TREATMENT FOR ALZHEIMER's DESISE #

82
00:10:16,445 --> 00:10:18,945
Got another one for the collection.

83
00:10:34,141 --> 00:10:36,641
It's good to be home.

84
00:10:40,647 --> 00:10:43,147
I missed you Mom.

85

# TO DO LIST 1) PICK UP SCUBA GEAR
2) DAY CLEANING 3) PRESCRIPTION FOR MOM #

86
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:25,141
Run a check on that, will you?

87
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:14,575
Carol?
- Surprise!

88
00:12:15,045 --> 00:12:17,596
Surprise, how are you?

89
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,315
Happy birthday

90
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,916
Happy birthday buddy.

91
00:12:25,387 --> 00:12:29,178
I told you I'd get you.
- Thank you, girl.

92
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:34,289
Hi everybody. - Have a drink.
- It's exactly what I need.

93
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:38,227
See ya darling.
- Excuse me. How are you?

94
00:12:49,675 --> 00:12:52,755
Didn't know I had so many friends.
- They just came here for the free booze.

95
00:12:53,426 --> 00:12:55,926
It ain't the art.

96
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:59,291
You know, I...

97
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,196
I went to see your mother,
while you were gone.

98
00:13:03,627 --> 00:13:05,922
Did you happen to get the
report that I left for you?

99
00:13:05,923 --> 00:13:08,511
I did, but I didn't get
a chance to look at it.

100
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:13,160
You know, I think that I
finally found someone for you.

101
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:19,738
Believe it or not, just easy going,
a good listener, and very lonely.

102
00:13:20,795 --> 00:13:23,648
I want you to meet Barb. Barb, Taylor.

103
00:13:25,426 --> 00:13:28,423
Aren't you going to say hi?
- Hi, Barb.

104
00:13:28,647 --> 00:13:32,594
That's right. Now Barb, this gentleman
is going to take care of you from now on,

105
00:13:32,747 --> 00:13:37,773
and I want you to be nice to him, stay with
him and make sure he doesn't get introuble.

106
00:13:38,022 --> 00:13:41,362
Carol, I don't know how to take care
of a fish. - It's not organic chemistry.

107
00:13:42,423 --> 00:13:47,641
Anybody seen Max?
- He's late as usual... excuse me.

108
00:13:48,098 --> 00:13:51,115
I, you, that's, I'm going to...
- Talk to him, talk to him.

109
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:54,133
Would you like a...
- No, I'm good. I'm good, I'm good.

110
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:57,479
I just had one. I'm... new friend?
- Thanks for asking.

111
00:13:57,861 --> 00:14:01,021
Do you feel any better?
- Well, yeah... yeah.

112
00:14:02,111 --> 00:14:04,611
No, I just think I had too much
to drink, you know. - Good.

113
00:14:05,193 --> 00:14:07,693
What do you think of those
three artists over there?

114
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,806
Yeah, you know, we'll see.
- Usually I don't mind a little moustache,

115
00:14:11,807 --> 00:14:14,788
but I think that is out of the question.
That's all I've got to say.

116
00:14:16,453 --> 00:14:19,630
What are you two delinquents up to?
- Max, you missed the whole party, buddy.

117
00:14:20,288 --> 00:14:22,788
Hey slick, it wasn't my
birthday, you know what I mean.

118
00:14:23,551 --> 00:14:26,140
But I did have to close a little deal.
- Cubans.

119
00:14:27,635 --> 00:14:32,075
250 a box baby, and I got a box
for you in the car. - I love you Max.

120
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:35,673
And happy birthday Deep... - Come on now.
I got you a fish. Hope you don't mind.

121
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:39,264
Hey birthday boy, I got a little something
for you. - No, for me? - Yeah, for you buddy.

122
00:14:39,722 --> 00:14:42,642
And we're going to open this downstairs.
You want to come with us, Deep?

123
00:14:43,894 --> 00:14:48,653
I think I'm going to go check out some art.
- Yeah, right.

124
00:14:49,392 --> 00:14:51,892
Save the two brunettes for me, will ya?

125
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:57,278
Hey. You want the little cracker and some
cheese? - Yeah, maybe in Carol's office.

126
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:01,879
This is supposed to be 'Numero Uno'.

127
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:09,404
It was grown, on the
lushest hill in Bordeaux

128
00:15:09,455 --> 00:15:11,955
by a one-legged man named Pepe.

129
00:15:13,298 --> 00:15:17,647
And it was bottled in 1971,
the year of your birth,

130
00:15:19,195 --> 00:15:22,111
and my marriage,

131
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:26,891
and Pepe's untimely divorce.

132
00:15:28,646 --> 00:15:31,146
Let it breathe now.

133
00:15:32,878 --> 00:15:35,378
Alright.
- Cheers.

134
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:46,058
That's kind of weird.
- It's dog shit.

135
00:15:47,819 --> 00:15:50,091
I spent 400 on this garbage.

136
00:15:50,092 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm sorry. Let it breathe a little bit.
- Let it breather nothing.

137
00:15:53,063 --> 00:15:55,563
See if there's any beer in there. God!

138
00:15:56,669 --> 00:15:59,028
In there.

139
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:02,712
God.
- We're in luck. Two Miller's.

140
00:16:03,275 --> 00:16:06,490
Good, yeah, well. It's Miller time now.

141
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:10,539
Get this taste out of my mouth.

142
00:16:13,025 --> 00:16:15,525
Oh yeah.

143
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,379
Oh, Taylor...

144
00:16:24,852 --> 00:16:27,352
I'm getting old.

145
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:32,986
Seems like yesterday, that I was
toasting your arrival with champagne.

146
00:16:34,004 --> 00:16:39,967
It was pretty good stuff too. Your
mom, she'd bring you by to visit.

147
00:16:40,718 --> 00:16:43,218
You're like the son I never had.

148
00:16:45,002 --> 00:16:47,502
Look at you now.

149
00:16:48,153 --> 00:16:50,653
And me.

150
00:16:53,723 --> 00:16:57,642
And that's our future, Taylor
Briggs. Never turns out the way

151
00:16:57,786 --> 00:17:01,913
you think it's going to.
- Well, cheers to that.

152
00:17:05,664 --> 00:17:09,428
Are you going to still help me, move
my Mom's stuff? And buy the beer?

153
00:17:09,718 --> 00:17:12,143
How am I going to move
the stuff if I'm drunk?

154
00:17:12,144 --> 00:17:14,644
Hasn't hurt your golf aim has it?

155
00:17:17,326 --> 00:17:21,476
Well, if I haven't told
you, sport, happy birthday.

156
00:18:07,985 --> 00:18:11,403
# SUNDAY, MARCH 21. 1971 #

157
00:18:13,647 --> 00:18:15,987
Hey!

158
00:18:15,988 --> 00:18:18,488
Wait!

159
00:19:42,619 --> 00:19:46,736
How did he do? - Well, Nick dropped
the ball in the outfield and lost the game.

160
00:19:46,782 --> 00:19:50,098
Oh man, I'm sorry.
- And, you know, I've been working with him,

161
00:19:51,335 --> 00:19:53,835
I don't know.

162
00:19:55,908 --> 00:19:58,166
You look like shit.

163
00:19:58,167 --> 00:20:00,667
Thanks. You're a good friend, Deep.
- Yeah.

164
00:20:01,545 --> 00:20:04,843
Hey little man. - Hey, bud. -
What's up, Taylor? - Nothing.

165
00:20:04,844 --> 00:20:07,584
What do you mean nothing? There's
always got to be something?

166
00:20:07,628 --> 00:20:10,482
Yeah, right, there's something.
- Hey, Nick, check this out.

167
00:20:11,394 --> 00:20:13,894
Yeah, you just build on that.
- You got it.

168
00:20:19,946 --> 00:20:22,411
It happened again.
- What, puberty?

169
00:20:22,412 --> 00:20:24,912
No, I saw the guy in the trench coat.

170
00:20:25,418 --> 00:20:29,118
So, who is this guy? - That's just it,
I don't know, I, I can't see his face.

171
00:20:31,144 --> 00:20:33,744
Taylor, you banged the crap out
of your head in that hotel room.

172
00:20:34,617 --> 00:20:37,257
You know, concussions can cause
memory loss, memory regression,

173
00:20:37,308 --> 00:20:40,297
all kinds of stuff, you know this.
- That's just it, it's not my memory.

174
00:20:41,392 --> 00:20:44,790
He had a newspaper dated
March 21st, 1971, in his car.

175
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:47,348
Okay, so why is this guy walking
around with an old newspaper?

176
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:53,186
It wasn't old at the time.
- Let me get this straight.

177
00:20:54,007 --> 00:20:57,247
You're telling me you're seeing things
that happened a year prior to your birth.

178
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,291
Why are you treating this so seriously?

179
00:21:03,023 --> 00:21:05,523
Just humor me, will you?
Test the powder.

180
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:49,401
Tulane University's Masters thesis.
"Dreaming with the Dead", William Terrel.

181
00:21:51,471 --> 00:21:55,655
Part of an ancient worldwide religion,
red ocher was used as a body dye by man

182
00:21:55,779 --> 00:21:58,428
and his ancestors for
almost two million years.

183
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:01,808
As a geneticist, I intend
on traveling to Brazil.

184
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:08,017
Amazonian Indians are the last to
practice this once universal ceremony.

185
00:22:11,552 --> 00:22:15,270
Covered in red ocher, they are branded with
a symbol before they ingest sacred powder.

186
00:22:19,518 --> 00:22:23,103
As they claim to see through
the eyes of their dead ancestors.

187
00:23:25,266 --> 00:23:28,795
You should have discovered here, is that
we're not really drawing this scene at all.

188
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,053
But merely trying to capture
the light it's giving off.

189
00:23:34,411 --> 00:23:39,323
The object is always an illusion.
Okay? We'll continue this next week.

190
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,818
Stephanie Jacobs?
- What can I do for you?

191
00:23:43,819 --> 00:23:46,107
My name is Taylor Briggs. Hi.

192
00:23:46,108 --> 00:23:49,199
I'm interested in buying one of
your paintings. - You buy a lot of art,

193
00:23:49,431 --> 00:23:51,931
Taylor Briggs?
- Only the good stuff.

194
00:23:54,427 --> 00:23:57,698
Great work this week.
Do you buy hot chocolate?

195
00:23:59,964 --> 00:24:04,046
I graduated Med School 10 years ago.
- So, go on.

196
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:07,832
And then I decided, I didn't
want to be a doctor, at all.

197
00:24:09,403 --> 00:24:12,545
You sound more confused than I am.
- Well, I knew I didn't want to work

198
00:24:12,612 --> 00:24:15,918
for the HMOs or the insurance companies,
because they don't give two shits

199
00:24:15,975 --> 00:24:20,349
about helping people. And I finished
my residency and became a researcher.

200
00:24:21,748 --> 00:24:24,248
What do you research?
- Alzheimer's Syndrome.

201
00:24:33,268 --> 00:24:35,768
So, you like the painting
of the man in the coat?

202
00:24:37,067 --> 00:24:40,443
What makes you say that? - It's my
only painting on the market right now.

203
00:24:42,085 --> 00:24:44,585
Right.

204
00:24:46,353 --> 00:24:49,381
What made you... What made
you create it? - I don't know,

205
00:24:49,537 --> 00:24:52,262
I came home one day and it
just sort of, painted itself.

206
00:24:54,879 --> 00:24:58,916
Do you sell a lot of paintings?
- No, not many.

207
00:25:00,338 --> 00:25:03,529
I mostly teach, which is, actually
what I have to do right now.

208
00:25:04,821 --> 00:25:07,321
Bye, Doctor Briggs.
- Goodbye.

209
00:25:13,181 --> 00:25:17,544
It's sand, but I want to
be sure. So I smoked it.

210
00:25:20,247 --> 00:25:22,600
Cute. Appreciate it.

211
00:25:22,601 --> 00:25:26,354
Taylor, it's sand, and 4
percent ground up cerebral tissue.

212
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:30,453
Great. Brain.
- Yeah, yeah, I found traces of melatonin,

213
00:25:30,511 --> 00:25:32,990
which is only from the pineal gland.
- Pineal?

214
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:36,471
Yeah, it's just trace amounts, okay. I even
ran some samples, on some of the lab rats.

215
00:25:37,124 --> 00:25:38,928
Came back as nothing. It had no effect.

216
00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:40,849
What am I seeing,
a fucking fantasy world here?

217
00:25:40,942 --> 00:25:43,442
You have another theory?
- You know that patient in Brazil,

218
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,625
he was an American geneticist
named William Terrel.

219
00:25:47,314 --> 00:25:49,648
He was doing a study of
a remote tribe of Indians,

220
00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:53,416
that were engaged in this ancient ceremony
that dates back almost two million years.

221
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:58,783
It involves ingesting sacred powder.
I think Terrel, I think he stole it.

222
00:25:59,095 --> 00:26:01,768
And the guy got exposed to it,
and my goddamn glove ripped.

223
00:26:03,088 --> 00:26:08,395
The crazy part is this, these Indians, and
they could let you see through the eyes

224
00:26:08,514 --> 00:26:12,924
of your dead ancestors. They
can see things, and images,

225
00:26:13,637 --> 00:26:15,864
that happened before you were born.
- Are you serious?

226
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:20,138
You're spouting mystic mumbo-jumbo. The
lab rats showed no changes. It's nothing.

227
00:26:20,439 --> 00:26:22,939
What am I supposed to do?
- Go get laid.

228
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,378
Actually, I met a girl the
other day. She's an artist.

229
00:26:28,016 --> 00:26:30,239
Really, I thought you didn't go for that.

230
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,740
And she's no ordinary artist.
- Does she paint naked?

231
00:26:33,478 --> 00:26:36,932
You're an idiot. She did this painting,
I liked it, she was all business though,

232
00:26:36,978 --> 00:26:40,612
she blew me off.
- See. That's why you like her.

233
00:26:41,202 --> 00:26:45,782
That about covers it, so thank you, for
everything, and we'll see you all tomorrow.

234
00:26:58,636 --> 00:27:02,215
The pineal gland is actually the
ancient remains of a primordial eye,

235
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,770
pointing straight up out of the head.

236
00:27:07,752 --> 00:27:13,621
Pineal gland also creates DMT, the most
powerful hallucinogenic known to science.

237
00:27:18,969 --> 00:27:24,517
DMT is often attributed to the out-of-body
experiences in near death situations.

238
00:27:38,207 --> 00:27:40,707
Gee... Jesus!
- Sorry.

239
00:27:40,843 --> 00:27:45,344
Sorry about that. Run out of ideas?

240
00:27:47,502 --> 00:27:50,002
And you came all the way
over here to ask me that?

241
00:27:50,179 --> 00:27:55,402
No, you scared me. I was improvising.
- So what did you come over here for?

242
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:01,175
Well, you know when H-2-0
cools to a certain temperature,

243
00:28:01,233 --> 00:28:04,226
it forms this solid, called...
- Ice.

244
00:28:04,572 --> 00:28:08,121
That's it. And, you know sometimes
people like to strap blades,

245
00:28:08,715 --> 00:28:12,620
to the bottoms of their feet and
glide across it. So, you know,

246
00:28:12,921 --> 00:28:18,062
I was wondering, if, well,
do you like having fun?

247
00:28:20,939 --> 00:28:23,521
It's funny, I used to come
here all the time when I was a kid.

248
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,561
This is an abandoned building.
When was the last time you skated?

249
00:28:29,452 --> 00:28:33,138
I have to admit, it's been a while.
- Well, it's probably better this way.

250
00:28:33,989 --> 00:28:37,429
Skating's not my forte.
- Yeah, well what did you do as a kid?

251
00:28:38,433 --> 00:28:41,871
Not much. - You didn't skate, you
didn't swim, or anything? - No,

252
00:28:41,926 --> 00:28:46,170
I nearly drowned when I as little. -
That would put a damper on things? - Yeah.

253
00:28:46,835 --> 00:28:51,616
I was sick for a long time. But,
being cooped up inside all the time,

254
00:28:51,656 --> 00:28:54,092
got me into art. So...

255
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:58,658
Yeah. This place is over.

256
00:28:59,528 --> 00:29:02,463
Well this, this was a unique experience.

257
00:29:03,133 --> 00:29:05,598
I don't really hang out in
condemned buildings much.

258
00:29:05,633 --> 00:29:08,509
Well, give me a couple of days,
I could top that. - Try me.

259
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:19,530
Let me give you a hand with that.
- Taylor, we're running out of space in here.

260
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,340
Max and I are going to move your
stuff this weekend, don't worry.

261
00:29:22,341 --> 00:29:24,381
Hall closet, hall closet.
- Thanks, Nurse Ratched.

262
00:29:54,487 --> 00:29:56,987
Mom.

263
00:30:02,277 --> 00:30:04,777
The three mountain peaks?

264
00:30:08,995 --> 00:30:12,478
# LAKE SARAWAC, N. H. 1971 #

265
00:31:35,642 --> 00:31:38,142
# NO TRESSPASSING LAKE SARAWAK
WATERSHED PROJECT 1982 #

266
00:32:09,326 --> 00:32:11,826
Why is it clearing?

267
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:11,302
Damn it! Fucking keys!

268
00:33:20,927 --> 00:33:23,427
Come on.

269
00:33:31,072 --> 00:33:33,351
Taylor, it's a coincidence.

270
00:33:33,352 --> 00:33:36,770
Come on, there's a freezer right
where I remember it being 30 years ago.

271
00:33:38,111 --> 00:33:40,862
Yeah, but you saw it in
a clearing, not in a lake.

272
00:33:44,568 --> 00:33:48,107
That was three decades ago man,
the lake would have changed by then.

273
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:51,960
Come on. You still dating this
off a newspaper from a dream?

274
00:33:52,215 --> 00:33:55,789
I found the exact place from my
dream, just like I remembered it,

275
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:59,091
it had a lake, it had trees,
it had three mountain peaks.

276
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:02,098
All because you saw a photo
of your mom up there in '71?

277
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,921
I mean, it's plausible she
took you up there as a kid

278
00:34:04,922 --> 00:34:07,422
and maybe the memories sat
dormant in your subconscious.

279
00:34:07,594 --> 00:34:10,166
Maybe that's why you see
yourself in these visions. - No.

280
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:14,835
Fine. Then give me a rational
explanation as to how you can see things,

281
00:34:14,931 --> 00:34:18,013
that ever happened, before
you were even born. - I can't.

282
00:34:20,093 --> 00:34:24,662
So, how's the artist doing?
- Steph? She's good. Thanks.

283
00:34:25,232 --> 00:34:29,198
Coming to the Wednesday dinner. - She's
going to a Wednesday dinner? - Yeah.

284
00:34:29,303 --> 00:34:31,223
You're going to introduce
her to Max before me?

285
00:34:31,224 --> 00:34:32,829
You know, I got to break her in slowly.

286
00:34:33,708 --> 00:34:36,268
I want to make sure she likes
me before I introduce her to you.

287
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,176
Steph, this is my Mom's friend, Carol.
- How nice to meet you.

288
00:34:41,256 --> 00:34:43,756
Very nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you look familiar.

289
00:34:44,366 --> 00:34:47,858
Well, I'm a painter.
- Maybe I saw you at an opening.

290
00:34:48,254 --> 00:34:51,211
Yeah, probably. You know, I've heard
of your gallery. - Well, good.

291
00:34:51,346 --> 00:34:54,564
You know, Steph did a painting
of a man in a trench coat,

292
00:34:54,707 --> 00:34:59,064
I thought it was really interesting, and,
I stalked her and made her go out with me.

293
00:34:59,337 --> 00:35:03,011
Yes, he did.
- I'd love to see your work sometime.

294
00:35:03,252 --> 00:35:06,910
Sure, anytime. So,
is Max a great cook?

295
00:35:07,954 --> 00:35:12,630
I wouldn't really use
that word... great,

296
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,713
I mean it's, - Burnt. -
more like burnt, yes, burnt.

297
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:20,923
How do you guys all know each other?
- I met Alicia, that's Taylor's mother,

298
00:35:21,723 --> 00:35:25,554
at Mass General, where she trained with Max.
- You're a doctor as well?

299
00:35:25,786 --> 00:35:29,140
No, no, no, no. I went there
to get stitched up one time.

300
00:35:29,341 --> 00:35:33,016
And Alicia took care of me,
and we've been friends ever since.

301
00:35:36,989 --> 00:35:41,718
How's the food? - It's going to be great.
I picked up some choice chops at the store.

302
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:44,377
Stephanie.
- Max.

303
00:35:44,378 --> 00:35:47,496
Taylor's been very evasive
about you to all of us.

304
00:35:47,765 --> 00:35:51,731
Now I'm going to want a full report
and I'm willing to share information.

305
00:35:52,405 --> 00:35:54,952
Well, Max, I think
we're going to have to talk.

306
00:35:55,312 --> 00:36:00,120
My two loves were medicine and Jenny.
I miss her more than life itself.

307
00:36:00,823 --> 00:36:03,236
Of course she could get
under my skin like nobody...

308
00:36:03,237 --> 00:36:05,737
I like the painting.
- Oh yeah?

309
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:10,379
She always wanted to be an astronaut.That's
why I had that made for her birthday,

310
00:36:10,908 --> 00:36:15,905
years ago, it's been up there so long, I
never even thought about taking it down now

311
00:36:18,256 --> 00:36:22,739
So, how are the chops?
- Well done.

312
00:36:22,897 --> 00:36:25,374
No, no, no, that's
blackened Cajun-style.

313
00:36:25,936 --> 00:36:29,636
Now, no one can resist lamb chops a la Max.

314
00:36:31,403 --> 00:36:37,098
Hey, you watch it now. Both of you.
- So are you going to brief me on Taylor here?

315
00:36:37,174 --> 00:36:40,534
Listen, I got the whole story on him, right
in the living room. - No, no, you know,

316
00:36:40,535 --> 00:36:43,815
I think it's getting a little late. I
think we should be going. It's the traffic.

317
00:36:43,816 --> 00:36:46,032
No problem, no problem, we'll see you later.
- Thanks.

318
00:36:48,264 --> 00:36:51,275
Get in there brother, get in there.
- You're evil.

319
00:36:51,891 --> 00:36:55,324
Come on, skip that for tonight.
- You know I don't like a mess,

320
00:36:56,203 --> 00:37:01,806
in anybody's house. Come on. - You know
my new screening room, it's got everything.

321
00:37:03,672 --> 00:37:06,001
I just don't know how to turn it on.

322
00:37:06,002 --> 00:37:11,018
Nope. Got to be this,

323
00:37:13,614 --> 00:37:16,114
Alright, there we go.

324
00:37:20,202 --> 00:37:23,022
Which one are you? - I'm the
one scoring the touchdown, naturally.

325
00:37:23,893 --> 00:37:28,498
That's me, in my stud days.
- Look how young Carol and Mom were.

326
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:33,730
You can see we're a bunch of show-
boaters. - Yeah, I can see that.

327
00:37:35,349 --> 00:37:37,849
I'm going to fast forward.

328
00:37:38,843 --> 00:37:42,373
It took us about two months
to talk his mom into this deal.

329
00:37:46,187 --> 00:37:51,171
That took all of about 5 seconds.
And it took, well I had to listen

330
00:37:51,231 --> 00:37:55,910
to his mom for the next 5 years about
it. That was back when Taylor's mom

331
00:37:55,987 --> 00:37:58,487
and I worked at Mass General Hospital.

332
00:38:00,865 --> 00:38:03,365
That's Carol.

333
00:38:08,033 --> 00:38:10,533
Is that you and your mom?

334
00:38:18,152 --> 00:38:20,652
Yeah, me and my Jenny.

335
00:38:30,146 --> 00:38:32,976
I can see they're kind of
like parents to you. - Yeah.

336
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,534
So, where are your parents?
- That. My mother is here in Boston

337
00:38:40,096 --> 00:38:43,001
and as for my father, I never
knew him. He died before I was born.

338
00:38:44,161 --> 00:38:46,661
I know what that is like. I was adopted.

339
00:38:50,909 --> 00:38:55,458
Well, Taylor Briggs, it's a...
chilly night.

340
00:38:56,868 --> 00:38:59,368
I wouldn't want you to catch a cold.

341
00:39:10,048 --> 00:39:13,993
Barb... how's the water temperature?

342
00:39:18,508 --> 00:39:21,008
Is that better?

343
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:38,079
1971.

344
00:40:46,841 --> 00:40:49,341
Five year old Allison Frost
perished with her father.

345
00:40:49,959 --> 00:40:52,459
The burning vehicle collided with a tree.

346
00:41:05,268 --> 00:41:09,043
# A PHOTO OF ALLISON FROST TAKEN
ONE WEEK BEFORE THE ACCIDENT #

347
00:41:39,895 --> 00:41:43,135
Taylor, what do you want me to say? You're
telling me there's some guy out there

348
00:41:43,186 --> 00:41:45,685
kidnapping little girls,
before we were even born?

349
00:41:45,743 --> 00:41:48,211
Yeah, well, all the facts
are coming together. - Facts?

350
00:41:48,212 --> 00:41:51,119
Allison Frost died in a car
accident. Her body was found,

351
00:41:51,256 --> 00:41:55,374
ID'ed and buried. Facts.
- Fact. I saw her, March 21st, 1971.

352
00:41:55,511 --> 00:41:58,896
One, she was alive.
Two, her tooth had grown in

353
00:41:59,916 --> 00:42:02,571
Which proves she didn't die
in a goddamn car accident.

354
00:42:02,633 --> 00:42:05,945
Taylor, you're refuting documented
news articles with your own dreams?

355
00:42:06,011 --> 00:42:08,609
I found her. I pulled her name
on the internet. She exists!

356
00:42:12,465 --> 00:42:16,030
Jessica Arnold. I just pulled her out of
thin air. I even thought she'd be brunette.

357
00:42:16,638 --> 00:42:19,138
Come on.
- Paula James.

358
00:42:19,613 --> 00:42:22,413
Maybe you saw a picture of her and
your mind just filled in the gaps.

359
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:27,172
Paula James.
- She's hot.

360
00:42:28,849 --> 00:42:32,294
Oh shit man, come on!
I'm not making this up!

361
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,880
What I'm feeling is
fucking real, I don't care.

362
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:40,710
Close the door behind you.

363
00:42:50,584 --> 00:42:55,429
We've got to get you out of here.
Beautiful sunshine, it's good for you.

364
00:42:55,976 --> 00:43:00,068
Yeah. Did you hear me?

365
00:43:00,734 --> 00:43:03,975
Totally fucked!
- Just can't find a good hot dog these days.

366
00:43:06,243 --> 00:43:10,192
See the big, red light that's up there.
You got your on, you got your off.

367
00:43:10,743 --> 00:43:14,090
Channel, volume, give it a hit.

368
00:43:14,643 --> 00:43:17,143
Yeah.
- Yeah.

369
00:43:22,136 --> 00:43:24,636
Hello.

370
00:43:30,196 --> 00:43:34,314
This is, really good.
- Yeah, it's my first.

371
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:39,509
I got it, don't I?
- Yeah, I have to admit, you've got talent.

372
00:43:39,705 --> 00:43:41,938
Thank you.
- Make yourself comfortable.

373
00:43:42,388 --> 00:43:45,321
I'm kind of busy here.
- Take your time, smells good.

374
00:43:46,251 --> 00:43:48,751
Hello. That wasn't there, was it?

375
00:43:49,278 --> 00:43:51,778
Watch it.
- Sorry.

376
00:43:53,517 --> 00:43:57,120
Do you live here alone?
- Yeah, I like space.

377
00:44:05,363 --> 00:44:08,748
Is that original, Stephanie Jacobs?
- Yeah.

378
00:44:09,986 --> 00:44:12,486
It's beautiful.
- Thank you.

379
00:44:19,982 --> 00:44:22,482
I hope you're hungry.

380
00:44:34,426 --> 00:44:37,026
Oh God, you'd be perfect if you
drank beer and played poker too.

381
00:44:41,392 --> 00:44:44,198
I only play high stakes.
- I got no problem with that.

382
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,100
This is going to hurt.

383
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:07,619
I feel like I'm back.
- Forget the comeback. Take it off.

384
00:45:16,844 --> 00:45:19,844
Is this what you want to see?
- You're the one who wanted the high stakes.

385
00:45:20,552 --> 00:45:23,052
At least I know I'm going to bed a winner.

386
00:45:26,548 --> 00:45:29,048
Well...

387
00:45:35,003 --> 00:45:37,503
I'm going to bed naked.

388
00:45:46,187 --> 00:45:49,850
So, when do I meet the family?
- You're a bad one,

389
00:45:49,971 --> 00:45:52,471
I'm not taking you home to meet them.
- What?

390
00:45:52,904 --> 00:45:58,264
Besides, they're retired and travel a lot.
- I'll show them a few magic tricks.

391
00:45:58,859 --> 00:46:02,275
Yeah, they're not into magic. - Alright,
then I'll get in good with the brother.

392
00:46:03,018 --> 00:46:06,018
Brother's overseas in the military.
- Then I'll get in good with the dog.

393
00:46:06,212 --> 00:46:08,712
Dog's dead.
- Then I'm fucked.

394
00:46:11,283 --> 00:46:13,283
You know what, I'm thirsty,
how about some water?

395
00:46:13,284 --> 00:46:14,995
That's a good idea, that sounds great.

396
00:46:17,591 --> 00:46:20,091
I'll get that.

397
00:46:59,501 --> 00:47:03,108
The last couple of times were great.- Daddy,
I don't like it here as much though.

398
00:47:03,175 --> 00:47:06,929
The water's too cold. - We're lucky
to be in here after hours at all, okay.

399
00:47:36,309 --> 00:47:38,809
Daddy?

400
00:47:41,652 --> 00:47:44,152
Dad! Daddy! Dad, help me!

401
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:47,240
Dad! No!

402
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:55,440
Somebody help me! Daddy!

403
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,300
Daddy, why won't you help me!

404
00:48:04,269 --> 00:48:06,769
Daddy!

405
00:48:06,873 --> 00:48:09,373
Taylor. Taylor.

406
00:48:11,038 --> 00:48:13,851
It wasn't Allison Frost this
time. It was a different girl.

407
00:48:14,788 --> 00:48:17,288
It's crazy, I kind of became him.

408
00:48:17,935 --> 00:48:20,435
Goddamn it, it felt like he was...

409
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:25,074
He knows what he's doing is wrong, and he,

410
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:28,791
will do anything to try to stop it, and...

411
00:48:31,699 --> 00:48:34,617
it's as if he's lost something
that he's trying to get back.

412
00:48:35,656 --> 00:48:38,983
What's he lost?
- A child maybe.

413
00:48:40,656 --> 00:48:43,918
I saw him kidnap a little girl in the
locker room and he started some fire and,

414
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:48,904
Oh God. I'm the date
from hell, I'm sorry.

415
00:48:53,229 --> 00:48:55,729
This happened recently?

416
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,540
This happened over 30 years ago.

417
00:49:03,672 --> 00:49:06,478
There's more.
- What?

418
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:13,648
He looks like the figure in your painting.

419
00:49:17,352 --> 00:49:19,967
Why didn't you tell me this before?
- It sounded so nuts.

420
00:49:22,033 --> 00:49:24,533
How could I?

421
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,900
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

422
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:41,441
# OVERCOAT SYRINGE KIT
SPOTLIGHT BLACKGLOVES #

423
00:49:42,142 --> 00:49:45,651
Hello? - Check your e-mail. I
researched your locker room story.

424
00:49:53,753 --> 00:49:56,253
Three die in fire at community college.

425
00:50:01,018 --> 00:50:04,282
Lisa Mullins, her father and an
unidentified second child perished.

426
00:50:06,872 --> 00:50:11,338
This is her. - But you didn't say anything
about a second child in the janitor's closet.

427
00:50:13,194 --> 00:50:17,098
I don't know, but this is the girl.
- The other little girl was never identified.

428
00:50:17,288 --> 00:50:20,171
You sure about this?
- I'm not sure about anything,

429
00:50:20,197 --> 00:50:23,076
but is this community college still around?

430
00:51:08,736 --> 00:51:11,236
He brought another body, in a bag,

431
00:51:12,625 --> 00:51:15,125
that he had over there.
- You sure?

432
00:51:15,865 --> 00:51:19,720
Gas tanks here, gas
tanks. To start a fire.

433
00:51:23,952 --> 00:51:26,452
It started prematurely.

434
00:51:26,783 --> 00:51:29,283
Oh God, this stuff is real, isn't it?
- Yeah.

435
00:51:31,324 --> 00:51:33,824
Let's get out of here.
- In a minute.

436
00:51:33,912 --> 00:51:36,412
Taylor, please.

437
00:51:40,304 --> 00:51:42,537
I know what the second body is for.
- Yeah.

438
00:51:43,563 --> 00:51:46,220
What if, every time he takes a little girl,

439
00:51:46,776 --> 00:51:49,276
he leaves a surrogate body in her place.

440
00:51:49,536 --> 00:51:51,896
Somebody's going to notice
the corpse isn't the same girl.

441
00:51:51,897 --> 00:51:55,446
Not if it's burnt beyond recognition,
and the dental records are inconclusive,

442
00:51:55,587 --> 00:51:57,360
They didn't have DNA testing then.

443
00:51:57,361 --> 00:51:59,201
Yeah, but Taylor, he didn't take Lisa Mullins.

444
00:51:59,227 --> 00:52:04,426
Exactly. The fire, it startedprematurely,
and he didn't have time to switch bodies,

445
00:52:04,627 --> 00:52:07,787
that's why he found Lisa's dad, Lisa
and another body meant to replace her.

446
00:52:09,965 --> 00:52:12,465
So you think he switched a
body for Allison Frost too?

447
00:52:15,495 --> 00:52:19,207
No one ever saw that car hit the tree.
No one ever saw that fire break out.

448
00:52:21,045 --> 00:52:24,506
All they found was a burnt car, burnt
bodies. We have no idea what happened then.

449
00:52:25,437 --> 00:52:29,207
Finding a girl replacement is not
easy. - God, what if he's switching...

450
00:52:30,524 --> 00:52:32,912
What if he's switching the
last ones with the next.

451
00:52:32,913 --> 00:52:37,563
Look, Taylor, this is irrelevant. If
this stuff happened over 30 years ago,

452
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:40,110
isn't it too late to help them now?

453
00:52:57,949 --> 00:53:00,449
Photo download complete.

454
00:53:25,892 --> 00:53:28,607
Son of a bitch. You're still alive.

455
00:53:30,717 --> 00:53:33,217
What have you been doing all this time?

456
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:46,407
Elementary school... Carmen
Flaherty burned to death...

457
00:53:54,679 --> 00:53:57,179
Olivia Vazquez, house fire.

458
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:03,105
Bonnie McHale, burned
to death in a forest fire.

459
00:54:08,331 --> 00:54:11,497
Taylor Briggs.
- You're in a good mood.

460
00:54:12,459 --> 00:54:15,311
Yeah, well, to be honest, I've
been hanging out with this girl

461
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:17,605
that I met at your birthday party.
- Really?

462
00:54:17,606 --> 00:54:20,106
Yeah, she's pretty cool.
What are you doing here?

463
00:54:20,687 --> 00:54:23,087
You're going to kill me.
I'm going to need a favor. - What?

464
00:54:23,088 --> 00:54:26,556
I need some old coroner's reports.
- You want fries with that too?

465
00:54:28,497 --> 00:54:33,078
I just need 3 files, okay? I'm sure that
you can get them through the med school.

466
00:54:34,709 --> 00:54:37,869
Look, I'll do it this time, okay, but
you are really starting to creep me out.

467
00:54:38,094 --> 00:54:41,876
Come in for some tests. - Do it.
I'll be in. - Deal. - Thank you.

468
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:47,261
Between an accordion and an onion? - I
don't know. What's the difference between...

469
00:54:47,338 --> 00:54:49,789
accordion and an onion?
- An accordion and an onion?

470
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:55,368
Nobody cries when you cut up an accordion.
- You find that really funny?

471
00:54:56,064 --> 00:54:58,948
No!
- It's a sympathy laugh.

473
00:55:19,178 --> 00:55:21,905
The only body that was
unrecognizable, was Bonnie McHale.

474
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:25,710
What happened to her? - Missing on a scout
trip in New Hampshire four months ago.

475
00:55:25,866 --> 00:55:28,226
Look at this, a fire breaks
out, the only thing they find,

476
00:55:28,227 --> 00:55:32,231
are the unrecognizable remains of
Bonnie McHale. He took her. I know it.

477
00:55:34,487 --> 00:55:36,999
It's just like he did with
Allison and Lisa back in '71.

478
00:55:40,809 --> 00:55:43,309
Hello?

479
00:55:43,929 --> 00:55:46,136
Be right over.

480
00:55:46,137 --> 00:55:48,688
Some of the advanced lab
works came back on the powder.

481
00:55:49,967 --> 00:55:53,390
We found traces of
di-methyltryptamine. - Di-methyl what?

482
00:55:54,153 --> 00:55:57,749
DMT, it's one of the most
powerful hallucinogenics known,

483
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:01,713
it's created in the pineal gland secreted
in the brain at the point of death.

484
00:56:02,158 --> 00:56:04,658
It's thought that it might
numb the experience of death.

485
00:56:06,011 --> 00:56:09,253
Do you remember the rats
I gave the samples to? - Yeah.

486
00:56:09,403 --> 00:56:12,403
One of them turned out to be pregnant.
Now we didn't think anything of it,

487
00:56:12,944 --> 00:56:15,444
until one of the babies got in here.

488
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,811
Those are the two babies.

489
00:56:24,812 --> 00:56:27,734
How many times has he done that?
- This is his first.

490
00:56:28,928 --> 00:56:31,428
He's never done this before?
- No, but his mother has.

491
00:56:32,172 --> 00:56:34,672
How long did it take for her to learn?
- 3 months.

492
00:56:34,852 --> 00:56:37,652
What are you saying? - I wish
I had some more of this powder to test.

493
00:56:38,048 --> 00:56:43,380
But it's all gone. All I can say now,
is that it appears that the powder

494
00:56:43,451 --> 00:56:47,634
has given this litter of rats,
their mother's memories of this maze.

495
00:56:48,019 --> 00:56:50,824
How could memories be
transferred between organisms?

496
00:56:51,946 --> 00:56:54,446
This powder is lighting up
the same primordial areas,

497
00:56:55,136 --> 00:56:57,700
stuff dealing with instincts
and long-term memories.

498
00:57:00,271 --> 00:57:04,045
You know, the only thing is, how can
memories be passed from a parent to a child?

499
00:57:04,414 --> 00:57:06,914
Deep, you remember
the human genome project?

500
00:57:07,751 --> 00:57:11,181
95 percent of our DNA serves
no purpose in our life function. - So?

501
00:57:11,441 --> 00:57:16,079
So, what if our genes stored
the memories of our parents,

502
00:57:16,809 --> 00:57:21,194
right up the point of birth. What if the
DNA link is severed right at that point?

503
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:23,910
Taylor, I don't know what to tell you.
- Wait a minute.

504
00:57:24,312 --> 00:57:27,512
These memories would have to come from...
- Someone with a direct genetic link,

505
00:57:27,513 --> 00:57:30,538
like a mother, or a father.

506
00:57:34,831 --> 00:57:39,225
My Mom's personal stuff. I don't know
why she didn't put these photos in albums.

507
00:57:59,216 --> 00:58:01,941
I've never seen her
shout at my father before.

508
00:58:11,503 --> 00:58:15,515
How many scout clubs hike up
in those mountains? - What?

509
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:22,848
If he kidnapped Bonnie McHale, then
he knew she was going to be out there.

510
00:58:27,114 --> 00:58:30,557
He knew her.
- Wait, where are you going?

511
00:58:33,851 --> 00:58:36,351
Come on Ricky, we're going
to be late, let's go, buddy.

512
00:58:37,002 --> 00:58:41,692
This is really messed up. Don't
you think this is a little too far?

513
00:58:42,618 --> 00:58:45,118
Call me on the cell
phone, if they get back.

514
00:59:41,641 --> 00:59:44,141
Funeral service?

515
01:00:29,508 --> 01:00:32,008
Princess B1 is now online.

516
01:00:33,959 --> 01:00:38,189
Message received from Leizfak.
#LEAVE IT ALONE TAYLOR #

517
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,914
Shit! Oh, Goddamn it!

518
01:00:53,352 --> 01:00:56,822
# I KNOW WHAT YOU'VE DONE #

519
01:00:59,218 --> 01:01:01,718
Damn it.

520
01:02:35,853 --> 01:02:39,290
You dying Taylor?
- Never better.

521
01:02:39,964 --> 01:02:42,578
Nick, give Dad a minute, okay?
- Okay.

522
01:02:43,444 --> 01:02:45,944
See you sport.

523
01:02:48,276 --> 01:02:51,076
What's happening? - You went into
a seizure. Steph brought you in.

524
01:02:51,206 --> 01:02:53,706
You've been here all night.
- Am I okay?

525
01:02:55,134 --> 01:02:57,634
I ran an MRI scan.

526
01:03:02,955 --> 01:03:06,872
Oh great, I'm going to end up like Terrel.
- Slow down, the anomalies are still small.

527
01:03:07,002 --> 01:03:09,502
And you only touched it that once, right?
- Yeah, just once.

528
01:03:09,713 --> 01:03:12,273
Okay, so I think you'll be fine,
but you need to get some rest.

529
01:03:12,274 --> 01:03:14,938
DMT is dangerous.
- No, you need to get me out of here.

530
01:03:15,207 --> 01:03:18,206
Taylor, I can't release you..
- You get me out of here, goddamn it.

531
01:03:18,370 --> 01:03:21,770
Deep, I know what I'm seeing right now, I
don't care if I walk out of here bare-ass,

532
01:03:21,771 --> 01:03:25,371
you're going to get me the hell out of here.
- But what you're seeing doesn't make sense.

533
01:03:25,372 --> 01:03:28,132
Out of all a person could remember,
why are you seeing these things?

534
01:03:28,533 --> 01:03:31,653
Will you tell him to take it easy,
alright, he's not listening to me anymore.

535
01:03:33,914 --> 01:03:37,886
My earliest memory is burning my
finger on a sparkler on the 4th of July.

536
01:03:38,246 --> 01:03:41,893
What's yours? - Getting a tube shoved down
my throat in the hospital, when I was sick.

537
01:03:42,052 --> 01:03:45,683
Okay, trauma, right,
regret. I'm seeing his regrets.

538
01:03:45,745 --> 01:03:48,807
Why regrets?
- Because regrets, the highs, the lows,

539
01:03:48,969 --> 01:03:51,469
these are the only things
we remember from our lives.

540
01:03:52,054 --> 01:03:55,534
It's the only thing that would be passed on
from organism to offspring, don't you see?

541
01:03:55,535 --> 01:03:58,338
What did you see this time?
- I saw Allison again.

542
01:03:59,907 --> 01:04:04,209
I took her to a shack in the woods
and made a cast impression of her face.

543
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:08,319
Is he in love with them?
- It's like they're his children,

544
01:04:09,259 --> 01:04:12,476
no, it's not sexual, it's
more like a parent's love.

545
01:04:12,752 --> 01:04:15,312
It's like he's trying to help them.
- He's trying to help them?

546
01:04:15,313 --> 01:04:18,180
He's keeping them in
fridges. Let's go to the cops.

547
01:04:18,295 --> 01:04:20,808
To tell them what, that I'm
getting all this from a dream.

548
01:04:20,866 --> 01:04:23,546
They wouldn't believe me.
- It's better than breaking into houses.

549
01:04:50,677 --> 01:04:53,305
You scared the shit out of me.
- You scared the shit out of you.

550
01:04:53,805 --> 01:04:56,070
The side door is open.
Anybody could be in here.

551
01:04:56,071 --> 01:05:00,102
You know, I came to see Alicia,
and this place was a mess.

552
01:05:00,112 --> 01:05:02,392
I wasn't really expecting
company, Carol, you know.

553
01:05:02,393 --> 01:05:04,893
You haven't thrown out
the garbage in three days.

554
01:05:05,497 --> 01:05:07,997
Oh, hi Stephanie.
- Hi.

555
01:05:08,835 --> 01:05:11,929
You know, I would love to
drop by and see your work.

556
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:16,769
I work out of my loft on
Berry, so anytime you... - Great.

557
01:05:23,115 --> 01:05:26,651
Carol, there's something I want to ask you.
- Sure.

558
01:05:29,367 --> 01:05:33,598
Is there anything you can tell me
about my Father? - What's this all about?

559
01:05:34,118 --> 01:05:37,822
You know those, all those alternative
journals you've been giving me,

560
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:40,392
with the past life regressions and the...
- Yes... Yes.

561
01:05:40,871 --> 01:05:45,516
...channeling whoever, well,
have you ever, come across something

562
01:05:45,569 --> 01:05:50,872
that has to do with seeing
your parents' memories? - No.

563
01:05:53,303 --> 01:05:55,803
What have you been seeing?

564
01:05:59,744 --> 01:06:02,244
Is this my Dad's car?

565
01:06:04,094 --> 01:06:07,242
How would I know that? - I don't
know, you guys were friends, right?

566
01:06:10,825 --> 01:06:15,578
You know your mother never liked to
talk about it. She was very young,

567
01:06:17,671 --> 01:06:21,751
and I think that he, hurt her, very much.

568
01:06:22,891 --> 01:06:25,391
Maybe Max knows.

569
01:06:27,970 --> 01:06:32,152
Max was the Chief Resident
at Mass General and,

570
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:35,786
your mother was an intern,
and I was the patient. - Right.

571
01:06:36,026 --> 01:06:39,716
This was after she had
ended it with your father.

572
01:06:40,626 --> 01:06:45,321
And I really have no idea whose car that is.
- Okay. Thanks.

573
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:48,540
You have to forget about the past.

574
01:06:50,002 --> 01:06:53,300
Just move forward, and would you please,

575
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:56,176
please, get some rest.

576
01:07:00,158 --> 01:07:02,812
This was his username on Bonnie's computer.

577
01:07:03,857 --> 01:07:06,372
You ever hear of that?
- No.

578
01:07:14,022 --> 01:07:16,522
Nothing.

579
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,500
Hey, look at this.

580
01:07:27,895 --> 01:07:30,395
Kafziel appears in a
shining blast of light.

581
01:07:30,586 --> 01:07:33,746
You've got to be kidding me. - He was
the angel of death over little children.

582
01:07:34,926 --> 01:07:37,426
He was cast out of heaven.

583
01:07:37,892 --> 01:07:41,481
He took no interest in boys, but dedicated
himself to preserving the innocence

584
01:07:42,301 --> 01:07:44,801
of little girls.

585
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:56,653
This is really scary to me.

586
01:07:57,597 --> 01:08:00,097
That's why you can't be around here anymore.
- What?

587
01:08:01,766 --> 01:08:04,486
I may not have these memories in
my head, but I'm part of this now.

588
01:08:04,487 --> 01:08:09,653
I know, and that's the problem. I
don't know where this is going. I'm...

589
01:08:11,365 --> 01:08:14,859
That's it? - Yeah... - You're being
ridiculous! Why are you acting like this?

590
01:08:14,894 --> 01:08:16,974
Because I don't think you
should be here right now.

591
01:08:16,975 --> 01:08:18,855
I don't think you should
be with me right now,

592
01:08:18,856 --> 01:08:21,105
and I think you should go, right now.

593
01:08:24,935 --> 01:08:27,435
Get out, please.

594
01:08:28,664 --> 01:08:31,164
Get out!
- Fine!

595
01:08:35,337 --> 01:08:37,837
Shit.

596
01:09:52,575 --> 01:09:55,477
Ready to move?
- Max, I'm so sorry, I completely forgot.

597
01:09:56,844 --> 01:09:59,964
What the hell have you been doing, Rip
Van Winkle, I left 3 messages for you.

598
01:10:00,077 --> 01:10:04,382
I haven't been feeling too good, man.
- No shit.

599
01:10:05,952 --> 01:10:09,259
Viral?
- I don't know. Probably, maybe.

600
01:10:11,485 --> 01:10:14,883
Well, we don't need
to move this shit today.

601
01:10:17,265 --> 01:10:19,765
The smoke bother you?
- No, it's fine.

602
01:10:20,642 --> 01:10:24,245
I think I'll just stick
around and nurse myself a beer.

603
01:10:30,185 --> 01:10:35,976
You're looking at my shoes. - Yeah,
they're really cool, where did you get those?

604
01:10:36,112 --> 01:10:39,460
I've had these forever. I mean,
I use them to just, you know, I...

605
01:10:41,093 --> 01:10:44,449
...you know, fart around the
house in them. They're back in style,

606
01:10:44,511 --> 01:10:47,013
I'll get you a pair, pal.
- Yeah, that'd be great.

607
01:10:48,749 --> 01:10:51,249
Are you okay?

608
01:10:52,567 --> 01:10:55,067
Deep says that you need to get laid.

609
01:10:55,939 --> 01:11:00,495
Now that Steph... She's great
looking to me, I think?

610
01:11:03,782 --> 01:11:08,161
If I don't lie down, I don't
know what I'm going to do, Max.

611
01:11:10,204 --> 01:11:13,530
Okay, I can go rent myself
some DVDs or something.

612
01:11:15,643 --> 01:11:18,910
I'm sorry, Max.
- No, no, no, you get some rest, buddy.

613
01:11:19,587 --> 01:11:22,386
I will. - Okay, pal.
- Have a good night. Bye bye.

614
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:53,390
Bonnie.

615
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:56,000
Bonnie!

616
01:11:57,706 --> 01:12:00,206
Bonnie.

617
01:12:04,034 --> 01:12:06,534
Bonnie!

618
01:12:07,410 --> 01:12:09,910
Bonnie!

619
01:12:10,105 --> 01:12:12,605
Hello?

620
01:12:41,814 --> 01:12:44,314
Get away!

621
01:13:28,136 --> 01:13:30,636
Go away.

622
01:13:31,231 --> 01:13:33,731
No.

623
01:13:48,104 --> 01:13:50,604
Max? Max! Max!

624
01:13:55,757 --> 01:13:58,257
Man, come on!

625
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:14,440
What the fuck is going on?

626
01:14:31,709 --> 01:14:33,966
What have I done?

627
01:14:33,967 --> 01:14:36,467
Oh my God! Fuck!

628
01:14:59,428 --> 01:15:01,642
Carol!

629
01:15:01,643 --> 01:15:04,143
Carol!

630
01:17:32,984 --> 01:17:36,354
Allison Frost... what
are you doing here?

631
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:50,915
These are copies of all my stuff.

# GENETICALLY INHERITED MEMORY? #

633
01:18:09,148 --> 01:18:14,560
Leizfak is now online.
- They've been finding them on the internet.

634
01:19:30,504 --> 01:19:33,004
Psych evaluation report.

635
01:19:36,125 --> 01:19:38,625
Carol Barbara Hargrave

636
01:19:41,504 --> 01:19:44,518
Doctor for 3 years before
killing her abductor.

637
01:19:45,696 --> 01:19:49,151
Patient raped and impregnated
by deceased abductor.

638
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:33,616
Adopted by Dr. Alisha Briggs.

639
01:20:36,473 --> 01:20:38,973
Witnessed by Max?

640
01:20:41,266 --> 01:20:43,766
Biological mother.

641
01:20:47,707 --> 01:20:50,207
Carol Hargrave.

642
01:22:25,496 --> 01:22:27,996
God. Dear God.

643
01:23:15,561 --> 01:23:18,061
Steph?

644
01:23:26,347 --> 01:23:28,847
What? What is it?

645
01:23:55,762 --> 01:23:59,489
Why didn't you tell me? - You don't
need to know about your real father.

646
01:24:00,431 --> 01:24:03,289
He was a story no one wants know.

647
01:24:04,292 --> 01:24:08,221
Why did you have to kill Max?
- I made it look like you did it.

648
01:24:09,162 --> 01:24:13,661
Max wasn't your father. He was
the last link to the adoption.

649
01:24:14,748 --> 01:24:19,092
I had to kill him so that I
wouldn't have to kill my own son.

650
01:24:21,252 --> 01:24:26,849
You're going to have to kill me now.
- You will never take this away from me.

651
01:24:27,711 --> 01:24:32,620
Where's Bonnie?
- Be calm, Taylor, I know what you've seen.

652
01:24:33,521 --> 01:24:36,862
But every memory has to have an end.

653
01:24:37,583 --> 01:24:43,076
It'll go in a blinding light.
And it'll just get colder,

654
01:24:44,086 --> 01:24:46,480
and colder,

655
01:24:46,481 --> 01:24:50,733
but unlike you, they will live on forever.

656
01:24:51,571 --> 01:24:54,821
Goodbye Taylor.
Goodbye Taylor.

657
01:24:55,669 --> 01:24:58,169
Goodbye Taylor.

658
01:25:42,823 --> 01:25:45,323
Where's Bonnie?

659
01:25:46,663 --> 01:25:49,163
Bonnie?

660
01:25:55,331 --> 01:25:57,831
Bonnie?

661
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:10,329
Come on, girl.

662
01:26:10,749 --> 01:26:13,249
Come on.

663
01:27:16,998 --> 01:27:19,498
Come on, go get it.
There you go. You get that?

664
01:27:20,094 --> 01:27:22,594
Come on.
- Bonni?

665
01:27:29,927 --> 01:27:33,887
Bonnie? Oh, my God! My God!

666
01:27:34,898 --> 01:27:39,064
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

667
01:27:40,410 --> 01:27:42,910
My God!

668
01:28:02,423 --> 01:28:04,923
You're going pro with those
new glasses, buddy. - Nice.

669
01:28:05,867 --> 01:28:09,356
Good news.
- Clean bill of health. You fucker.

670
01:28:09,757 --> 01:28:12,885
What did you say, Dad?
- I said, you're lucky, buster,

671
01:28:13,089 --> 01:28:15,589
because we're going to
get a pizza after the game.

672
01:28:16,383 --> 01:28:18,883
It's good to be alive, Deep.
- Yeah, it is.

673
01:28:31,351 --> 01:28:33,851
She'll always be my mother to me.

674
01:28:38,093 --> 01:28:40,593
This was her favorite room in the house.

675
01:28:44,021 --> 01:28:46,761
If she were alive, she'd
want you to work here.

676
01:28:57,683 --> 01:29:00,362
Oh, boy, got to get Nick to
the game, before he kills me.

677
01:29:00,562 --> 01:29:03,062
No, no, no, no.

678
01:29:09,129 --> 01:29:11,584
Thank you.
- For what?

679
01:29:11,585 --> 01:29:15,169
Everything.
- Yeah, alright.

680
01:29:18,243 --> 01:29:20,843
Is there anything else a big,
strong man can do before we leave?

681
01:29:20,844 --> 01:29:23,428
Yes, certainly. You can
log that upstairs for me.

682
01:29:23,589 --> 01:29:26,089
Oh, really? Alright.
- Yeah.

683
01:29:29,521 --> 01:29:32,625
Anything interesting? - Well, if you
find a kid's keepsakes interesting,

684
01:29:33,301 --> 01:29:35,801
check it out by all means.
- Alright.

685
01:29:42,101 --> 01:29:44,601
You okay?

686
01:29:51,958 --> 01:29:54,458
So did you break anything?

687
01:29:57,389 --> 01:29:59,889
Taylor?

688
01:30:02,053 --> 01:30:04,553
Are you okay?
- Where did you get this?

689
01:30:06,705 --> 01:30:10,065
I don't know. I had it on me in the hospital,
when they pulled me out of the water.

690
01:30:15,834 --> 01:30:18,334
Is Stephanie Jacobs your real name?

691
01:30:21,803 --> 01:30:24,303
The Jacobs named me that
when they adopted me.

692
01:30:25,389 --> 01:30:27,889
I don't remember my real name, why?

693
01:30:38,438 --> 01:30:40,938
Taylor, why?
