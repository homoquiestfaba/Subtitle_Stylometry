- Awesome, guys.</i>

<i>Oh, my God!
Did you... Wait, did you, uh,</i>

286
00:20:13,336 --> 00:20:16,036
<i>did you ask Nari's dad for
permission and did you film it?</i>

287
00:20:16,038 --> 00:20:18,306
<i>Please say you did because
oh, my God, I just...</i>

288
00:20:18,308 --> 00:20:20,541
<i>I loved the look on his face

290

292
00:20:26,316 --> 00:20:27,583

stood up to him,</i>

293
00:20:27,585 --> 00:20:30,952

It was just sweet.</i>

294
00:20:30,954 --> 00:20:33,491
<i>Serena, is your...
Is your mom excited?</i>

295
00:20:35,092 --> 00:20:38,694
<i>- Yeah, she's really excited.
- Cool.</i>

296
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:42,032
<i>I just, um...
You know...</i>

297
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:48,237
<i>Uh, the cancer has progressed,
so it's...</i>

298
00:20:48,239 --> 00:20:51,173
<i>It's... um,</i>

299
00:20:51,175 --> 00:20:53,143
<i>it's moved
into her brain and,</i>

300
00:20:53,145 --> 00:20:55,044
<i>uh, they have her
on life support, though,</i>

301
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:57,380
<i>and they're really trying
some aggressive treatment,</i>

302
00:20:57,382 --> 00:20:58,450
<i>so it's...</i>

303
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:02,051
<i>I wish I'd asked her sooner</i>

304
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:04,389

370
00:28:30,726 --> 00:28:32,525

375
00:28:58,856 --> 00:29:01,156

It switched when I connected.</i>

377
00:29:02,927 --> 00:29:05,930
<i>I, uh, I have no idea,

378

That's an overlay network.</i>

379
00:29:09,834 --> 00:29:11,667
<i>You've been bouncing it
everywhere.</i>

380
00:29:11,669 --> 00:29:13,870
<i>- What's an overlay network?
- Uh, hey, Damon,</i>

381
00:29:13,872 --> 00:29:15,905
<i>Damon, you gotta

382
00:29:15,907 --> 00:29:18,041
<i>Oh, um, sorry, uh,</i>

383
00:29:18,043 --> 00:29:20,209

385
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,847

- Yeah, probably.</i>

386
00:29:24,849 --> 00:29:27,051
<i>- Damon, what's darknet?
- Uh, it is part of the Internet</i>

387
00:29:27,053 --> 00:29:30,054
<i>that isn't or can't be

388

389
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:34,892
<i>like, um, Silk Road.
Damon, you know about that.</i>

390
00:29:34,894 --> 00:29:36,560
<i>It was all about drugs,
illegal IDs,</i>

391

<i>stolen credit cards, exploits,</i>

392
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:39,530

395
00:29:42,935 --> 00:29:45,003
<i>- Yeah, definitely... yeah.
- Yeah, maybe you should</i>

396
00:29:45,005 --> 00:29:47,540
<i>just leave whatever
that is alone, Matias.</i>

397
00:29:52,312 --> 00:29:53,778
<i>Oh, whoa! Okay.</i>

398
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,880

411
00:30:35,724 --> 00:30:37,691

three or four weeks.</i>

412
00:30:37,693 --> 00:30:39,893

you stole someone's computer?</i>

413
00:30:39,895 --> 00:30:41,895
<i>No, I didn't...
I didn't steal it, I just...</i>

414
00:30:41,897 --> 00:30:43,965
<i>Hold on, mate. You told me
you bought it on Craigslist.</i>

415
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,800
<i>I felt like shit
the moment I took it.</i>

416
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,235
<i>I don't know
what I was hoping for.</i>

417
00:30:47,237 --> 00:30:49,003
<i>I just... I kept having
to go there</i>

418
00:30:49,005 --> 00:30:51,739
<i>because I wanted a better
computer to work on my app with</i>

419
00:30:51,741 --> 00:30:54,675

436
00:31:36,822 --> 00:31:38,721
<i>Well, one of them

<i>Well, the computer
was acting strangely,</i>

445
00:31:57,877 --> 00:31:59,411
<i>so I ran a Disk Utility
and it said</i>

446
00:31:59,413 --> 00:32:02,013
<i>the drive was full, so...</i>

447
00:32:02,015 --> 00:32:03,982
<i>I was lookin' around

448
00:32:03,984 --> 00:32:05,917

449
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,920

<i>- Matias!
- Just shut it off!</i>

503
00:35:52,124 --> 00:35:53,957
<i>Matias, shut it off!</i>

504
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:55,127
<i>All right, all right,
all right!</i>

505
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,007
<i>That's him, isn't it?</i>

506
00:36:13,279 --> 00:36:14,914
<i>Don't answer.</i>

507
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,184
<i>Contributions?</i>

508
00:36:19,186 --> 00:36:21,019
<i>Charon 68,
the first thing he wrote</i>

509
00:36:21,021 --> 00:36:23,722
<i>was that he liked
the last contribution.</i>

510
00:36:23,724 --> 00:36:25,290
<i>Um, go back to the video folder</i>

511
00:36:25,292 --> 00:36:27,694
<i>and scroll all the way
to the bottom.</i>

512
00:36:27,696 --> 00:36:31,263
<i>Just go all the way down.</i>

513
00:36:31,265 --> 00:36:33,700
<i>No, Matias,
don't open it, please.</i>

514
00:36:33,702 --> 00:36:35,370
<i>- Just...
- No, just open.</i>

515
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,208
<i>No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, I don't...</i>

516
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,108
<i>Oh, God.</i>

517
00:37:48,781 --> 00:37:50,481
<i>Uh, no, no, no, no, okay.</i>

518
00:37:50,483 --> 00:37:52,349
<i>- No, I can't... I can't...
- Oh, God.</i>

519
00:37:52,351 --> 00:37:53,817
<i>Out of this one,
out of this one.</i>

520
00:37:53,819 --> 00:37:55,421
<i>I can't watch that.</i>

521
00:38:21,849 --> 00:38:24,449
<i>Okay, these are
custom videos, these are...</i>

522
00:38:24,451 --> 00:38:26,452
<i>Guys, that's what
they're trading.</i>

523
00:38:26,454 --> 00:38:28,554
<i>AJ, I don't...
I don't... I don't...</i>

524
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:32,293
<i>No, no, this is... Okay.</i>

525
00:38:35,296 --> 00:38:36,795
<i>Show me the most recent one.</i>

526
00:38:36,797 --> 00:38:38,165
<i>Nari.</i>

527
00:38:40,468 --> 00:38:42,201
<i>The last one,
it's a small file.</i>

528
00:38:42,203 --> 00:38:43,570
<i>It's smaller
than the other ones.</i>

529
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:45,772
<i>Oh, Jesus.</i>

530
00:38:45,774 --> 00:38:49,276
<i>Just open it.</i>

531
00:38:49,278 --> 00:38:50,512
<i>Okay.</i>

532
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:04,460
<i>Wait, wait, stop.</i>

533
00:39:06,596 --> 00:39:08,364
<i>This can't be real.</i>

534
00:39:19,309 --> 00:39:21,777
<i>Matias, go to the end.</i>

535
00:39:21,779 --> 00:39:23,246
<i>Go all the way to the end.</i>

536
00:39:30,888 --> 00:39:33,490
<i>Why is he looking
at the camera?</i>

537
00:39:38,529 --> 00:39:40,395
<i>- That was it, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

538
00:39:40,397 --> 00:39:42,297
<i>Well, then he might not
have her yet.</i>

539
00:39:42,299 --> 00:39:43,600
<i>She's still in her bedroom,</i>

540
00:39:43,602 --> 00:39:45,568
<i>all the other girls weren't.</i>

541
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:47,537
<i>Look, he chooses a girl,</i>

542
00:39:47,539 --> 00:39:49,172
<i>shows her to the rest
of the group,</i>

543
00:39:49,174 --> 00:39:51,474
<i>and waits for someone to pay.</i>

544
00:39:51,476 --> 00:39:53,309
<i>And someone just paid,
so this is...</i>

545
00:39:53,311 --> 00:39:55,345
<i>- this is the next girl.
- We have to report this, Nari.</i>

546
00:39:55,347 --> 00:39:57,246
<i>Oh, we have her address
so just we can do</i>

547
00:39:57,248 --> 00:39:59,248
<i>- a reverse phone look-up?
- Guys, I'll be right back,</i>

548
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:00,651
<i>- I'll be right back.
- Matias!</i>

549
00:40:02,321 --> 00:40:03,787
<i>Matias, I'm not...</i>

550
00:40:03,789 --> 00:40:05,389
<i>Look, please, I'm not...
No,</i>

551
00:40:05,391 --> 00:40:07,193
<i>please just give me
one second.</i>

552
00:40:14,668 --> 00:40:15,900
<i>Hello, hello!</i>

553
00:40:17,504 --> 00:40:18,605
<i>Hello!</i>

554
00:40:23,877 --> 00:40:25,677
<i>Kelly?</i>

555
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:26,945
<i>Kelly!</i>

556
00:40:26,947 --> 00:40:28,348
<i>Kelly!</i>

557
00:40:31,284 --> 00:40:34,720
<i>Hey! Hey, hold on, one second.</i>

558
00:40:34,722 --> 00:40:36,622
<i>Hello?</i>

559
00:40:36,624 --> 00:40:39,425
<i>Uh, yeah, we did.</i>

560
00:40:39,427 --> 00:40:41,293
<i>Okay. Well,</i>

561
00:40:41,295 --> 00:40:44,263
<i>he must have figured it out
'cause we got him.</i>

562
00:40:44,265 --> 00:40:45,965
<i>Yeah, sure thing.</i>

563
00:40:45,967 --> 00:40:48,935
<i>Thanks.</i>

564
00:40:48,937 --> 00:40:50,636
<i>Sorry, that was
the pizza place.</i>

565
00:40:50,638 --> 00:40:52,538
<i>I guess the driver called,
couldn't figure out</i>

566
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:56,510
<i>where we were or something,
I don't know. Hi!</i>

567
00:40:56,512 --> 00:40:58,845
<i>- Is, um, is Amaya with you right now?
- No.</i>

568
00:40:58,847 --> 00:41:00,414
<i>I mean, I just got in,</i>

569
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,916
<i>and I think Amaya's
in the shower.</i>

570
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:04,818
<i>Well, can you possibly get her
for me right now?</i>

571
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,486
<i>- Oh, wow! What?
- Uh...</i>

572
00:41:06,488 --> 00:41:08,321
<i>- Okay, are you there?
- Hello, hello?</i>

573
00:41:08,323 --> 00:41:09,589
<i>I can hear you.
Are you still there?</i>

574
00:41:09,591 --> 00:41:11,558
<i>- I just can't...
- Kelly, I can't see you.</i>

575
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,326
<i>- I can't see you.
- Uh, where'd you go?</i>

576
00:41:13,328 --> 00:41:14,629
<i>- Hold on a second.
- Yeah, is that</i>

577
00:41:14,631 --> 00:41:16,631
<i>- on your end or...
- No, I think it's my end.</i>

578
00:41:16,633 --> 00:41:19,434
<i>Yeah, sorry, hold on.</i>

579
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:21,936
<i>God! God! Kelly!</i>

580
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:23,538
<i>Kelly!</i>

581
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,541
<i>Kelly!</i>

582
00:41:29,479 --> 00:41:30,344
<i>Kelly!</i>

583
00:42:12,458 --> 00:42:13,659
<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait.</i>

584
00:42:32,813 --> 00:42:34,012
<i>Amaya, Amaya, Amaya,</i>

585
00:42:34,014 --> 00:42:36,381
<i>Amaya, Amaya, Amaya!</i>

586
00:42:36,383 --> 00:42:38,352
<i>Hey! Come here, come here!</i>

587
00:42:43,792 --> 00:42:45,825
<i>Can you see...</i>

588
00:42:45,827 --> 00:42:48,828
<i>Amaya, Amaya, Amaya!</i>

589
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:50,563
<i>Don't go in there,
don't go in there,</i>

590
00:42:50,565 --> 00:42:53,432
<i>don't go in there,
don't go... don't...</i>

591
00:42:53,434 --> 00:42:55,101
<i>stop, stop, stop!</i>

592
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:57,036
<i>Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.</i>

593
00:42:57,038 --> 00:42:58,571
<i>Come here, come here,
come here.</i>

594
00:42:58,573 --> 00:43:00,773
<i>Come here, come here.
Good, good.</i>

595
00:43:00,775 --> 00:43:03,844
<i>Shit. I... it must...
it must be a bug,</i>

596
00:43:03,846 --> 00:43:06,146
<i>or something.
Your computer called mine.</i>

597
00:43:06,148 --> 00:43:09,917
<i>Um, uh, Kelly, Kelly's, um,</i>

598
00:43:09,919 --> 00:43:14,121
<i>She's... she brought a...
she brought a guy home.</i>

599
00:43:14,123 --> 00:43:16,857
<i>He's... she's... don't, don't,</i>

600
00:43:16,859 --> 00:43:18,592
<i>don't disconnect.</i>

601
00:43:18,594 --> 00:43:20,629
<i>I'll wait for you.
I'll wait... I'll wait for you.</i>

602
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:33,741
<i>Hey!</i>

603
00:43:33,743 --> 00:43:34,744
<i>Hey!</i>

604
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:53,896
<i>Can you please sit down?</i>

605
00:44:10,816 --> 00:44:12,649
<i>Please, please, just please
don't hurt her.</i>

606
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:14,018
<i>I'll do anything
you want me to do,</i>

607
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:15,886
<i>I will do anything, I promise.</i>

608
00:44:23,529 --> 00:44:24,964
<i>How are you doing that?</i>

609
00:44:42,116 --> 00:44:45,452
<i>How can I give... I can't give
you the laptop if I can't...</i>

610
00:44:56,664 --> 00:45:00,166
<i>Wait just one second,
could you wait?</i>

611
00:45:00,168 --> 00:45:02,003
God.

612
00:45:08,109 --> 00:45:10,712
<i>Okay. Be calm. Just be...</i>

613
00:45:35,671 --> 00:45:37,571
<i>Matias, Matias, Matias,
Matias, okay.</i>

614
00:45:37,573 --> 00:45:39,274
<i>Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
no, I'm here, I'm here,</i>

615
00:45:39,276 --> 00:45:41,743
<i>- I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.
- Listen, here's the plan, okay?</i>

616
00:45:41,745 --> 00:45:43,912
<i>Nari is going to meet you down
at the police station,</i>

617
00:45:43,914 --> 00:45:45,880
<i>there's one that's half
a mile away from your place.</i>

618
00:45:45,882 --> 00:45:48,016
<i>You need to bring the laptop
with you, because every...</i>

619
00:45:48,018 --> 00:45:50,219
<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait,
where's Damon? Where's Damon?</i>

620
00:45:50,221 --> 00:45:51,821
<i>No, no, no, no, we need...
we need Damon.</i>

621
00:45:51,823 --> 00:45:53,756
<i>- Damon! Damon! We need Damon!
- What? Matias!</i>

622
00:45:53,758 --> 00:45:56,125
<i>- We need Damon right now! Damon!
- I'm sorry!</i>

623
00:45:56,127 --> 00:45:58,294
<i>- Have we called the police or what?
- No, we're not calling police.</i>

624
00:45:58,296 --> 00:45:59,962
<i>We're going to the police,
okay? Matias...</i>

625
00:45:59,964 --> 00:46:02,131
<i>We don't have a lot of time, okay?
We need to help this girl.</i>

626
00:46:02,133 --> 00:46:03,632
<i>- Matias!
- Yeah.</i>

627
00:46:03,634 --> 00:46:06,169
<i>- I know there's a lot going on, okay?
- Uh-hmm.</i>

628
00:46:06,171 --> 00:46:11,274
<i>But you need to trust us,
and you need to move fast.</i>

629
00:46:11,276 --> 00:46:14,277
<i>Get the laptop,
go down to the police station.</i>

630
00:46:14,279 --> 00:46:15,746
<i>- I will be there, okay?
- No.</i>

631
00:46:15,748 --> 00:46:17,948
<i>- I have a friend that will meet us.
- We can't.</i>

632
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:19,850
<i>He knows how to deal
with this kind of situation!</i>

633
00:46:19,852 --> 00:46:22,052
<i>- Yes! Yes, yes, yes, you can.
- No, we can't... we can't...</i>

634
00:46:22,054 --> 00:46:24,921
<i>It's not... it's not real.</i>

635
00:46:24,923 --> 00:46:26,623
<i>What?</i>

636
00:46:26,625 --> 00:46:28,061
<i>It's, um...</i>

637
00:46:29,762 --> 00:46:31,295
<i>It's a... it's a game.</i>

638
00:46:31,297 --> 00:46:32,629
<i>I made the whole thing up.</i>

639
00:46:32,631 --> 00:46:33,800
<i>It's a game.</i>

640
00:46:36,369 --> 00:46:40,707
<i>Lexx, you were... You were totally
onto me from the beginning.</i>

641
00:46:43,043 --> 00:46:45,144
<i>Wait, I'm confused.</i>

642
00:46:45,146 --> 00:46:46,611
<i>What?</i>

643
00:46:46,613 --> 00:46:48,313
<i>Yeah, it's, um, it's a game.</i>

644
00:46:48,315 --> 00:46:51,050
<i>It's my game. It's the one
I've been working on.</i>

645
00:46:51,052 --> 00:46:52,620
<i>Damon, Damon knows.</i>

646
00:46:54,755 --> 00:46:57,056
<i>I'm sorry, I'm lost.
I what now?</i>

647
00:46:57,058 --> 00:47:00,125
<i>I told you I was... I told you
I was writing something.</i>

648
00:47:00,127 --> 00:47:02,828
<i>- Matias, I'm...
- Uh, yeah, man, you said</i>

649
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:04,863
<i>you're writing something,
you didn't say playtesting</i>

650
00:47:04,865 --> 00:47:08,700
<i>- or implementing.
- Well, yeah, I wanted to be...</i>

651
00:47:08,702 --> 00:47:11,037
<i>I wanted to get an actual
response out of you, you know.</i>

652
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:13,706
<i>I mean, if you... If you knew what was
coming, then it wouldn't feel real.</i>

653
00:47:13,708 --> 00:47:17,977
<i>That way I could, you know, I could
tell if it actually could work.</i>

654
00:47:17,979 --> 00:47:20,680
<i>It is game night.</i>

655
00:47:20,682 --> 00:47:23,984
<i>- Holy shit, man!
- Asshole.</i>

656
00:47:23,986 --> 00:47:26,653
<i>- Oh, my God!
- I guess that means it was pretty good, huh?</i>

657
00:47:26,655 --> 00:47:28,923
<i>Matias, this is not funny.</i>

658
00:47:28,925 --> 00:47:31,292
<i>It's... actually, it's not,
it's not supposed to be funny.</i>

659
00:47:31,294 --> 00:47:33,928
<i>- It's actually, uh, it's a horror transmedia.
- Oh, holy shit... It's an ARG.</i>

660
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:36,398
<i>- It's an alternate reality game.
- Exactly, yeah.</i>

661
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,801
<i>It's a... it's a test of what you would
do if the experience actually happened.</i>

662
00:47:40,803 --> 00:47:42,736
<i>- Wow!
- Wow. That was bloody...</i>

663
00:47:42,738 --> 00:47:44,705
<i>- Wait, AJ, were you in on this?
- Hell no!</i>

664
00:47:44,707 --> 00:47:46,341
<i>I had no...
I had no idea about this.</i>

665
00:47:46,343 --> 00:47:49,010
<i>Where... dude, where'd you...
Where'd you get those videos?</i>

666
00:47:49,012 --> 00:47:51,813
<i>- That is some dark shit.
- Yeah.</i>

667
00:47:51,815 --> 00:47:54,916
<i>Yeah, I know, I know,
it's just horror films.</i>

668
00:47:54,918 --> 00:47:58,086
<i>What... hah! Okay, well,
you must have dug into some</i>

669
00:47:58,088 --> 00:48:01,090
<i>really obscure shit,
because I have seen everything</i>

670
00:48:01,092 --> 00:48:03,860
<i>and I haven't seen any
of those videos that you...</i>

671
00:48:03,862 --> 00:48:07,763
<i>What if we'd called
the police?</i>

672
00:48:07,765 --> 00:48:10,766
<i>Well, ideally you would...
you would register to play</i>

673
00:48:10,768 --> 00:48:13,870
<i>with your cell number,
so if, you know,</i>

674
00:48:13,872 --> 00:48:16,072
<i>by the time you logged in,
if you called 911,</i>

675
00:48:16,074 --> 00:48:18,142
<i>it would hack your phone
and you would get a recording</i>

676
00:48:18,144 --> 00:48:20,843
<i>like the bad guy hacked
into the phone.</i>

677
00:48:20,845 --> 00:48:22,312
<i>Wow!</i>

678
00:48:22,314 --> 00:48:24,948
<i>That, you know, it's crazy.</i>

679
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:26,919
<i>- Phew!
- Wait, the...</i>

680
00:48:47,207 --> 00:48:50,710
<i>I went to that ASL class,</i>

681
00:48:52,112 --> 00:48:54,346
<i>or the... or the...
or the first one,</i>

682
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:56,382
<i>the first one, at least.</i>

683
00:48:56,384 --> 00:48:58,017
<i>And then... and the guy,</i>

684
00:48:58,019 --> 00:49:00,219
<i>he was... he was...
he was teaching the class,</i>

685
00:49:00,221 --> 00:49:01,954
<i>he was talking about</i>

686
00:49:01,956 --> 00:49:05,824
<i>how hard it was
for a hearing-impaired person</i>

687
00:49:05,826 --> 00:49:08,495
<i>to have a meaningful
relationship with someone</i>

688
00:49:08,497 --> 00:49:10,162
<i>who couldn't sign.</i>

689
00:49:10,164 --> 00:49:13,766
<i>And then... and how it builds
this special bond,</i>

690
00:49:13,768 --> 00:49:16,869
<i>the ability to communicate
with someone</i>

691
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:18,307
<i>in a... in a special way
that would...</i>

692
00:49:24,112 --> 00:49:25,247
<i>And you're right.</i>

693
00:49:30,453 --> 00:49:32,754
<i>I'm really fucking scared,
Amaya.</i>

694
00:49:34,457 --> 00:49:36,490
<i>I mean, I've never cared</i>

695
00:49:36,492 --> 00:49:39,527
<i>about anyone or anything</i>

696
00:49:39,529 --> 00:49:41,030
<i>the way I care about you.</i>

697
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,234
<i>The night we met at the bar,</i>

698
00:49:46,236 --> 00:49:47,835
<i>I...</i>

699
00:49:47,837 --> 00:49:50,840
<i>the music was so loud, and...</i>

700
00:49:52,209 --> 00:49:55,312
<i>I saw you
and I remember thinking...</i>

701
00:49:56,447 --> 00:49:58,413
<i>Oh, why bother?</i>

702
00:49:58,415 --> 00:50:00,816
<i>That a beautiful person</i>

703
00:50:00,818 --> 00:50:02,384
<i>wouldn't be able
to hear you anyway,</i>

704
00:50:02,386 --> 00:50:03,988
<i>it's so loud.</i>

705
00:50:06,023 --> 00:50:09,492
<i>I didn't know you were deaf.</i>

706
00:50:09,494 --> 00:50:11,261
<i>I didn't know</i>

707
00:50:11,263 --> 00:50:13,999
<i>that all that noise
wouldn't matter.</i>

708
00:50:16,935 --> 00:50:20,503
<i>I mean,
that's what I want for us.</i>

709
00:50:20,505 --> 00:50:24,508
<i>I want nothing else to matter.</i>

710
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:27,278
<i>I want nothing
to be in the way</i>

711
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,215
<i>of how much I love you.</i>

712
00:50:38,858 --> 00:50:41,358
<i>I need you
to come here, okay?</i>

713
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:44,797
<i>I need you to get here
as fast as you can, okay?</i>

714
00:50:45,632 --> 00:50:48,201
<i>Take the subway, okay?</i>

715
00:51:00,981 --> 00:51:04,249
<i>Matias, what was
with them Roman numerals?</i>

716
00:51:04,251 --> 00:51:06,552
<i>- Like, why the Roman numerals?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

717
00:51:06,554 --> 00:51:08,154
<i>- What do you mean?
- That's weird.</i>

718
00:51:08,156 --> 00:51:10,256
<i>Well, in the game,
instead of Charon's</i>

719
00:51:10,258 --> 00:51:12,525
<i>just like being like a,
you know, Charon 4,</i>

720
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:14,260
<i>like the number four,
it had an IV.</i>

721
00:51:14,262 --> 00:51:16,896
<i>And what about the girl
in the video,</i>

722
00:51:16,898 --> 00:51:18,431
<i>the one who was next?</i>

723
00:51:18,433 --> 00:51:19,599
<i>What about her?</i>

724
00:51:20,636 --> 00:51:22,268
<i>Where'd you get the video?</i>

725
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:24,203
<i>Sorry, guys.
I got to take this.</i>

726
00:51:24,205 --> 00:51:26,139
<i>It's the... it's the
Puppet Masters.</i>

727
00:51:26,141 --> 00:51:28,608
<i>- No problem.
- Mute your mic, Lexx.</i>

728
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:30,377
<i>- Yeah.
- Mama!</i>

729
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:33,280
<i>Lexx, mute your mic!</i>

730
00:51:33,282 --> 00:51:35,650
<i>- Oh, my God.
- She does this every time.</i>

731
00:51:35,652 --> 00:51:37,250
<i>Yeah, you are louder than her.</i>

732
00:51:37,252 --> 00:51:40,087
<i>Oh, my God. Mama.</i>

733
00:51:40,089 --> 00:51:42,055
<i>I love how loud she is
on the phone to her mother.</i>

734
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:44,359
<i>It's just like,
straight up, like, bam.</i>

735
00:51:44,361 --> 00:51:45,393
<i>I know.</i>

736
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:53,234
<i>You guys,
we do not have to play a game.</i>

737
00:51:53,236 --> 00:51:55,203
<i>Let's just chat.
Let's just hang out,</i>

738
00:51:55,205 --> 00:51:58,674
<i>and, um, you know,
what if... you guys,</i>

739
00:51:58,676 --> 00:52:00,509
<i>maybe we should do
a guided meditation together.</i>

740
00:52:00,511 --> 00:52:01,744
<i>Um, no.</i>

741
00:52:01,746 --> 00:52:04,179
<i>I really did think
that was real for a second.</i>

742
00:52:04,181 --> 00:52:07,683
<i>I'm gonna be honest.
I was totally there.</i>

743
00:52:07,685 --> 00:52:10,386
<i>That was the most fun I've had,
in, like, two years.</i>

744
00:52:10,388 --> 00:52:13,190
<i>Ugh. Good one.</i>

745
00:52:58,672 --> 00:52:59,738
<i>Matias, Matias.</i>

746
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:01,339
<i>I have more questions, man.</i>

747
00:53:01,341 --> 00:53:03,175
<i>Yeah, here,
I'm sorry. What's up?</i>

748
00:53:03,177 --> 00:53:05,610
<i>Is it better, like,
that we did it as a team,</i>

749
00:53:05,612 --> 00:53:07,780
<i>or as a solo experience?</i>

750
00:53:07,782 --> 00:53:09,347
<i>And also...
and like how the hell</i>

751
00:53:09,349 --> 00:53:11,082
<i>are you handling
the decision tree?</i>

752
00:53:11,084 --> 00:53:12,284
<i>Like, say, if we had decided</i>

753
00:53:12,286 --> 00:53:14,252
<i>to do something
with the bad guy's money,</i>

754
00:53:14,254 --> 00:53:16,522
<i>if we'd taken it,
then how does that ripple</i>

755
00:53:16,524 --> 00:53:19,024
<i>through the rest of the story?</i>

756
00:53:21,095 --> 00:53:22,328
<i>Hello? Matia...</i>

757
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:24,630
<i>Oh, bloody hell,
he's away with the fairies.</i>

758
00:53:24,632 --> 00:53:26,265
<i>- Matias!
- Hold on, I'll be...</i>

759
00:53:26,267 --> 00:53:28,100
<i>I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.</i>

760
00:53:28,102 --> 00:53:29,803
<i>How long are you
gonna be gone this time?</i>

761
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:52,627
<i>Are you there?</i>

762
00:53:52,629 --> 00:53:55,229
<i>Are you there?
Can you hear me...</i>

763
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:56,533
<i>Hear me?</i>

764
00:54:02,706 --> 00:54:05,073
<i>Good.</i>

765
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:07,043
<i>Then watch this.</i>

766
00:54:38,677 --> 00:54:40,744
<i>You get the computer back</i>

767
00:54:40,746 --> 00:54:43,146
<i>when I get Amaya back.</i>

768
00:54:43,148 --> 00:54:45,148
<i>You get the money back
when I see on the news</i>

769
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:48,819
<i>that Erica Dunne is back home
safe with her parents.</i>

770
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:55,893
<i>You stupid motherfucker.</i>

771
00:54:55,895 --> 00:54:58,663
<i>- All I want is my laptop.
- All I want is Amaya.</i>

772
00:54:58,665 --> 00:55:00,197
<i>You don't understand</i>

773
00:55:00,199 --> 00:55:01,465
<i>what you have gotten
yourself into.</i>

774
00:55:01,467 --> 00:55:03,902
<i>- You killed Kelly!
- No, I didn't.</i>

775
00:55:03,904 --> 00:55:06,404
<i>If you lay a hand
on Amaya or Erica,</i>

776
00:55:06,406 --> 00:55:07,906
<i>you'll never see
any of that money.</i>

777
00:55:07,908 --> 00:55:09,741
<i>Shut the fuck up and listen.</i>

778
00:55:09,743 --> 00:55:12,611
<i>- They do not let girls go.
- What are you talking about?</i>

779
00:55:12,613 --> 00:55:15,280
<i>The Circle,
the people I work with,</i>

780
00:55:15,282 --> 00:55:17,316
<i>all the other Charon clients,</i>

781
00:55:17,318 --> 00:55:19,351
<i>they monitor
all Bitcoin accounts.</i>

782
00:55:19,353 --> 00:55:21,353
<i>They're gonna think
I'm trying to cash out.</i>

783
00:55:26,695 --> 00:55:28,895
<i>Hello?</i>

784
00:55:28,897 --> 00:55:30,532
<i>Hello, hello!</i>

785
00:55:35,236 --> 00:55:36,869
<i>I lost your screen.
What's going on?</i>

786
00:55:36,871 --> 00:55:39,439
<i>- What's happening?
- I don't... I don't know.</i>

787
00:55:39,441 --> 00:55:42,643
<i>Oh, God, they pulled you
across the river, didn't they?</i>

788
00:55:42,645 --> 00:55:44,778
<i>Hey, you know what?
I'm just... I'm gonna close it.</i>

789
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:46,380
<i>No!
Do not close it.</i>

790
00:55:46,382 --> 00:55:48,618
<i>They're gonna know
you're not me.</i>

791
00:55:52,722 --> 00:55:54,254
<i>Are they talking to you?</i>

792
00:55:54,256 --> 00:55:56,258
<i>What are they saying?</i>

793
00:55:58,527 --> 00:56:01,663
<i>They're saying...
they're saying recite the code.</i>

794
00:56:01,665 --> 00:56:02,931
<i>Oh, God.</i>

795
00:56:02,933 --> 00:56:04,833
<i>You just put a bullet
in our head.</i>

796
00:56:04,835 --> 00:56:07,571
<i>You stupid... Okay.</i>

797
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:10,707
<i>Listen to me.</i>

798
00:56:11,708 --> 00:56:13,642
<i>If they find out</i>

799
00:56:13,644 --> 00:56:15,878
<i>that I lost that computer, they're
gonna kill me, they're gonna kill you,</i>

800
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:18,346
<i>and they're gonna kill anyone
else that might have seen it.</i>

801
00:56:18,348 --> 00:56:19,882
<i>Just give me the code then.</i>

802
00:56:19,884 --> 00:56:20,983
<i>Give me the money
back first and then...</i>

803
00:56:20,985 --> 00:56:22,317
<i>No. Fuck you!</i>

804
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:23,385
<i>I am 10 feet away from Amaya,</i>

805
00:56:23,387 --> 00:56:25,354
<i>and I will put a knife
in her throat</i>

806
00:56:25,356 --> 00:56:27,223
<i>and disappear before
she even hits the ground.</i>

807
00:56:27,225 --> 00:56:29,225
<i>I think you're a dead man
who lost $10 million.</i>

808
00:56:29,227 --> 00:56:30,326
<i>This can be so easy.</i>

809
00:56:30,328 --> 00:56:31,995
<i>I return Amaya,
you return the laptop,</i>

810
00:56:31,997 --> 00:56:33,696
<i>and it'll be like nothing
ever happened.</i>

811
00:56:33,698 --> 00:56:34,831
<i>No, you killed Kelly!</i>

812
00:56:34,833 --> 00:56:36,699
<i>No, I didn't.
I just bashed her head.</i>

813
00:56:36,701 --> 00:56:38,935
<i>She'll wake up and think
it was a robbery or something.</i>

814
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,637
<i>We have no time for this.</i>

815
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:41,838
<i>Return the money.</i>

816
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:43,407
<i>No, no, no. No, no, no. No.</i>

817
00:56:43,409 --> 00:56:45,342
<i>When Erica Dunne is home safe,</i>

818
00:56:45,344 --> 00:56:46,910
<i>then you get the money.</i>

819
00:56:46,912 --> 00:56:48,779
<i>Okay.</i>

820
00:56:48,781 --> 00:56:50,714
<i>You better hurry up.</i>

821
00:56:50,716 --> 00:56:54,420
<i>They said this is
your last chance, Charon IV.</i>

822
00:56:56,288 --> 00:56:57,789
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

823
00:56:57,791 --> 00:57:00,892
<i>Type A-B-Y-S-S-U-S.</i>

824
00:57:00,894 --> 00:57:04,429
<i>Second word:
A-B-Y-S-S-U-M.</i>

825
00:57:04,431 --> 00:57:08,299
<i>Third word:
I-N-V-O-C-A-T.</i>

826
00:57:08,301 --> 00:57:09,634
<i>Oh, wait, they're typing
in all caps.</i>

827
00:57:09,636 --> 00:57:12,037
<i>- Should it be in all caps?
- Just fucking send it.</i>

828
00:57:12,039 --> 00:57:13,707
<i>Okay. All right.</i>

829
00:57:15,341 --> 00:57:17,275
<i>They're asking
why you drained the account.</i>

830
00:57:17,277 --> 00:57:19,547
<i>Tell them I switched
from Bitcoin to Ethereum.</i>

831
00:57:24,652 --> 00:57:25,951
<i>They're asking why.</i>

832
00:57:25,953 --> 00:57:27,720
<i>It's a better exchange rate.</i>

833
00:57:27,722 --> 00:57:28,789
<i>I got a tip.</i>

834
00:57:35,731 --> 00:57:37,298
<i>Are they buying it?</i>

835
00:57:41,937 --> 00:57:43,805
<i>Yeah, think so.</i>

836
00:57:47,375 --> 00:57:48,875
<i>We'll be there soon,
you'll get Amaya.</i>

837
00:57:48,877 --> 00:57:50,746
<i>And you'll get your laptop.</i>

838
00:57:53,983 --> 00:57:56,483
<i>If I let Erica go,</i>

839
00:57:56,485 --> 00:57:58,753
<i>they're gonna think
that she escaped and...</i>

840
00:57:58,755 --> 00:58:01,021
<i>they're gonna lose faith,
they're gonna hold me liable.</i>

841
00:58:01,023 --> 00:58:02,190
<i>Yeah, but you'll have
$10 million</i>

842
00:58:02,192 --> 00:58:06,061
<i>to help you figure out
how to disappear.</i>

843
00:58:06,063 --> 00:58:08,864
<i>If anything goes wrong
between here and there,</i>

844
00:58:08,866 --> 00:58:10,768
<i>you're both dead.</i>

845
00:58:16,106 --> 00:58:17,439
<i>He's lying to us.</i>

846
00:58:17,441 --> 00:58:19,975
<i>He's back. Matias.</i>

847
00:58:19,977 --> 00:58:23,044
<i>Yo. What?</i>

848
00:58:23,046 --> 00:58:27,549
<i>- Okay, Nari, it is just a game.
- I found her. Okay?</i>

849
00:58:27,551 --> 00:58:30,418
<i>- I found the girl, Matias, from your video.
- Found who?</i>

850
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:31,821
<i>She's real.
Her name's Erica Dunne.</i>

851
00:58:31,823 --> 00:58:33,856
<i>She is real,
and she's really missing.</i>

852
00:58:33,858 --> 00:58:36,092
<i>No, Nari, I know, I know.
I just... That was a...</i>

853
00:58:36,094 --> 00:58:38,561
<i>Is it... Is it just
a placeholder or like...</i>

854
00:58:38,563 --> 00:58:40,463
<i>Yeah. No, it is, it is,
it's a placeholder.</i>

855
00:58:40,465 --> 00:58:42,132
<i>Dude, that's messed up, man.</i>

856
00:58:42,134 --> 00:58:45,568
<i>Where did you even
get the video?</i>

857
00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:46,335
<i>LiveLeak.</i>

858
00:58:46,337 --> 00:58:47,403
<i>Yeah, someone on the inside</i>

859
00:58:47,405 --> 00:58:49,405
<i>just must have...
must have leaked it</i>

860
00:58:49,407 --> 00:58:50,473
<i>or something. I don't know.</i>

861
00:58:50,475 --> 00:58:52,611
<i>Why would you use that video?</i>

862
00:58:55,147 --> 00:58:56,847
<i>Okay, you know what?
Send the link.</i>

863
00:58:56,849 --> 00:58:58,515
<i>Nari, that's ridiculous.</i>

864
00:58:58,517 --> 00:59:00,050
<i>What?</i>

865
00:59:00,052 --> 00:59:02,086
<i>Who's that?</i>

866
00:59:02,088 --> 00:59:04,923
<i>Is that... Is that Amaya?</i>

867
00:59:04,925 --> 00:59:06,692
<i>Turn on your video, love.</i>

868
00:59:09,129 --> 00:59:11,930
<i>- Matias?
- No, no, no. Get him off.</i>

869
00:59:11,932 --> 00:59:14,432
<i>- Matias, is that you?
- How do we get this person off?</i>

870
00:59:14,434 --> 00:59:16,034
<i>Does anyone know
how we get this person off?</i>

871
00:59:17,771 --> 00:59:19,838
<i>- Stop it.
- Wait, what's going on?</i>

872
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,573
<i>Come on, Matias.</i>

873
00:59:21,575 --> 00:59:23,108
<i>Are you... you sneaky
little bastard.</i>

874
00:59:23,110 --> 00:59:24,742
<i>He's playing us.
It's still the game.</i>

875
00:59:24,744 --> 00:59:26,779
<i>No. No, guys, do... hey,
listen, do not click the link.</i>

876
00:59:26,781 --> 00:59:29,048
<i>- Is this the link?
- Do not click the link.</i>

877
00:59:29,050 --> 00:59:31,584
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

878
00:59:31,586 --> 00:59:33,152
<i>Guys,
we didn't click the link,</i>

879
00:59:33,154 --> 00:59:34,854
<i>but the video's playing anyway.</i>

880
00:59:34,856 --> 00:59:36,390
<i>Same here.</i>

881
00:59:37,758 --> 00:59:39,625
<i>- What the...
- What is it?</i>

882
00:59:39,627 --> 00:59:41,527
<i>That was senior year.
That's December.</i>

883
00:59:41,529 --> 00:59:43,897
<i>That's actually
McLeary's Pub, yeah?</i>

884
00:59:49,605 --> 00:59:51,605
<i>- This is so cool.
- What does this have</i>

885
00:59:51,607 --> 00:59:53,573
<i>- to do with the...
- I don't know.</i>

886
00:59:53,575 --> 00:59:56,910
<i>Wait, guys,
where is Lexx?</i>

887
00:59:56,912 --> 00:59:59,779
<i>She's probably still getting
a bollocking from her mom.</i>

888
00:59:59,781 --> 01:00:00,816
<i>Lexx!</i>

889
01:00:06,189 --> 01:00:07,788
<i>- What is that?
- That's Drill Bit.</i>

890
01:00:07,790 --> 01:00:09,624
<i>- That's an exploit.
- What is an exploit?</i>

891
01:00:09,626 --> 01:00:11,494
<i>It's a hacking tool.</i>

892
01:00:14,664 --> 01:00:15,730
<i>Lexx!</i>

893
01:00:15,732 --> 01:00:16,831
<i>Weird.</i>

894
01:00:16,833 --> 01:00:18,666
<i>Are you calling Lexx
right now?</i>

895
01:00:18,668 --> 01:00:20,568
<i>Yes,
I'm calling Lexx right now.</i>

896
01:00:20,570 --> 01:00:22,570
<i>Wait, wait,
I thought she was...</i>

897
01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:27,242
<i>Where is she?</i>

898
01:00:27,244 --> 01:00:29,211
<i>Okay, I am lo...</i>

899
01:00:29,213 --> 01:00:31,949
<i>Is she in on this, Matias?
What's going on?</i>

900
01:00:34,551 --> 01:00:35,951
<i>Is that the German place?</i>

901
01:00:51,736 --> 01:00:52,635
<i>No!</i>

902
01:00:52,637 --> 01:00:53,970
<i>Did she just jump?</i>

903
01:00:53,972 --> 01:00:56,008
<i>Oh, my God! Help!</i>

904
01:01:04,951 --> 01:01:07,151
<i>Matias?</i>

905
01:01:07,153 --> 01:01:08,721
<i>Was that Lexx?</i>

906
01:01:10,990 --> 01:01:13,057
<i>Jeez.</i>

907
01:01:13,059 --> 01:01:14,758
<i>Matias, please, talk to us.</i>

908
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:18,063
<i>This is just...
This is the game.</i>

909
01:01:18,065 --> 01:01:19,864
<i>That wasn't her.</i>

910
01:01:35,849 --> 01:01:38,650
<i>Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, how close are you?</i>

911
01:01:38,652 --> 01:01:40,755
<i>How close... how close
are you to the subway?</i>

912
01:01:42,023 --> 01:01:43,889
<i>Okay, okay, can you...
Can you do me a favor?</i>

913
01:01:43,891 --> 01:01:45,758
<i>Can you... Can you stay
on the call?</i>

914
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,760
<i>And just keep your...
keep your phone in your pocket,</i>

915
01:01:47,762 --> 01:01:50,765
<i>or whatever,
just stay on, okay?</i>

916
01:01:53,135 --> 01:01:54,935
<i>Just trust me, okay?</i>

917
01:01:54,937 --> 01:01:56,669
<i>And when you...
and I'll explain it to you</i>

918
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:59,572
<i>when you... when you get here,
all right?</i>

919
01:01:59,574 --> 01:02:01,041
<i>Wait, no.
Nari, Nari, Nari, Nari,</i>

920
01:02:01,043 --> 01:02:02,843
<i>- who are you calling?
- I'm calling Lexx.</i>

921
01:02:02,845 --> 01:02:04,778
<i>Don't. Please,
do not call her right now.</i>

922
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:06,680
<i>- Okay? Please, just trust...
- Straight to voicemail.</i>

923
01:02:06,682 --> 01:02:08,882
<i>Okay, guys. Hey, listen to me
for a second, all right?</i>

924
01:02:08,884 --> 01:02:10,717
<i>No more calls, all right?
We just... you can...</i>

925
01:02:10,719 --> 01:02:11,918
<i>you can leave your phones on,</i>

926
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,754
<i>- but just don't...
- Why?</i>

927
01:02:13,756 --> 01:02:15,890
<i>There are automated calls,
it's part of the game.</i>

928
01:02:15,892 --> 01:02:17,792
<i>I just... I just wanna make sure
that they're going through.</i>

929
01:02:17,794 --> 01:02:19,327
<i>Bullshit, Matias.
Bullshit, okay?</i>

930
01:02:19,329 --> 01:02:20,528
<i>- Okay, Nari, Nari.
- I have had enough.</i>

931
01:02:20,530 --> 01:02:22,663
<i>I swear, if you don't start
talking now...</i>

932
01:02:22,665 --> 01:02:23,998
<i>Matias is playing with you.</i>

933
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,967
<i>No. No, no,
I am calling the police.</i>

934
01:02:25,969 --> 01:02:28,069
<i>Nari, Nari, please.
Do not do that.</i>

935
01:02:28,071 --> 01:02:30,205
<i>- Please, hang, hang up the phone, Nari.
- No, I am not.</i>

936
01:02:30,207 --> 01:02:32,207
<i>- I am gonna call the police right now.
- Calm down, guys.</i>

937
01:02:32,209 --> 01:02:35,377
<i>Just give me one more second,
please, just one more second!</i>

938
01:02:35,379 --> 01:02:37,748
<i>Guys, it's real.
The whole thing is real.</i>

939
01:02:41,952 --> 01:02:44,720
<i>Just, just listen to me, all right?
The reason I said it was a game</i>

940
01:02:44,722 --> 01:02:47,357
<i>is because he said if anyone
knew or if anyone disconnected,</i>

941
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:49,925
<i>- he would kill Amaya and then he'd come after all of you.
- Who?</i>

942
01:02:49,927 --> 01:02:52,728
<i>Charon! Charon, Charon IV.
The guy whose laptop I took.</i>

943
01:02:52,730 --> 01:02:54,931
<i>Okay, Matias. We get it.
I'm kind of done with this now.</i>

944
01:02:54,933 --> 01:02:56,800
<i>Just... can you shut up
and listen to me, please?</i>

945
01:02:56,802 --> 01:02:59,369
<i>Please. He can hear
and see everything, all right?</i>

946
01:02:59,371 --> 01:03:01,671
<i>I mean, he, he found
Amaya's apartment.</i>

947
01:03:01,673 --> 01:03:04,040
<i>She was the first person I called, so he
must have been able to track her somehow,</i>

948
01:03:04,042 --> 01:03:06,976
<i>- or, or, or I don't know.
- You're serious? You're being serious right now?</i>

949
01:03:06,978 --> 01:03:09,712
<i>She's on her way over here,
and he's following her.</i>

950
01:03:09,714 --> 01:03:11,648
<i>Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Wait.
So, so there is no game.</i>

951
01:03:11,650 --> 01:03:13,150
<i>This is all
actually happening?</i>

952
01:03:13,152 --> 01:03:15,719
<i>Oh, my God. He-he killed Lexx.</i>

953
01:03:15,721 --> 01:03:17,955
<i>I... No...
I-I-I don't know.</i>

954
01:03:17,957 --> 01:03:20,257
<i>But he... he pushed her.
He-he-he bloody killed Lexx.</i>

955
01:03:20,259 --> 01:03:22,726
<i>If he was with Amaya, then how
could he have done that to Lexx?</i>

956
01:03:22,728 --> 01:03:24,862
<i>That's exactly the thing.
It wasn't him.</i>

957
01:03:24,864 --> 01:03:26,730
<i>- It must have been one of the others.
- The other what?</i>

958
01:03:26,732 --> 01:03:28,666
<i>The other... the Charons.
The ones who buy the videos,</i>

959
01:03:28,668 --> 01:03:30,836
<i>the ones who pick the girls.
They must have figured out</i>

960
01:03:30,838 --> 01:03:32,370
<i>- that the laptop got stolen.
- Oh, my God.</i>

961
01:03:32,372 --> 01:03:34,840
<i>Guys, they're not just gonna
let that evidence float around.</i>

962
01:03:34,842 --> 01:03:36,708
<i>So, all those videos,
they're all...</i>

963
01:03:36,710 --> 01:03:38,411
<i>This is damage control.
They're doing a clean-up.</i>

964
01:03:38,413 --> 01:03:40,679
<i>If they found Lexx, can they
find the rest of us, too?</i>

965
01:03:40,681 --> 01:03:42,848
<i>I am ghosted online.
They can't find me.</i>

966
01:03:42,850 --> 01:03:45,451
<i>Okay. He's right, he's right.
You need to get to AJ's house.</i>

967
01:03:45,453 --> 01:03:49,021
<i>No, wait. Do not... No!
If these guys are that good...</i>

968
01:03:49,023 --> 01:03:52,091
<i>they can track cell phones, they can track
cars. Do not lead them to my place.</i>

969
01:03:52,093 --> 01:03:55,428
<i>Just listen to me, guys. You have to stay
online and act like nothing is wrong.</i>

970
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:58,164
<i>What we can't do is sit around, wait
till someone shows up at our door.</i>

971
01:03:58,166 --> 01:04:00,733
<i>Wait. Wait, wait.</i>

972
01:04:00,735 --> 01:04:02,436
<i>How do we know
he's not listening now?</i>

973
01:04:02,438 --> 01:04:04,371
<i>Because of Facebook chat.
The green light,</i>

974
01:04:04,373 --> 01:04:05,973
<i>it goes off
when she loses connection.</i>

975
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:07,875
<i>That's why I told her
to take the subway.</i>

976
01:04:07,877 --> 01:04:10,077
<i>So when she'd lose connection
and went underground,</i>

977
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:12,079
<i>then I could tell you guys what
was fucking happening, all right?</i>

978
01:04:12,081 --> 01:04:15,916
<i>Look, there's no service in the station,
but there's Wi-Fi in the subway cars.</i>

979
01:04:15,918 --> 01:04:17,918
<i>So, as soon as she gets
on that train,</i>

980
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,820
<i>she's gonna have Wi-Fi again,
and so will he.</i>

981
01:04:19,822 --> 01:04:22,157
<i>All right? Let's just...
Can we just... can we just...</i>

982
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:24,459
<i>Can we just play a game in the meantime,
act like nothing is happening?</i>

983
01:04:24,461 --> 01:04:27,362
<i>- I'll give him the laptop when he gets here.
- Wait. If he's watching,</i>

984
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:29,731
<i>if he saw what happened to
Lexx, then doesn't he know?</i>

985
01:04:29,733 --> 01:04:31,533
<i>I don't... I don't know.
He hasn't said anything yet.</i>

986
01:04:31,535 --> 01:04:34,369
<i>So, uh, so it might have happened
when he didn't have connection or...</i>

987
01:04:37,441 --> 01:04:39,941
<i>Yo, AJ. AJ, AJ, dude,
get the hell out of there.</i>

988
01:04:39,943 --> 01:04:42,444
<i>- Get out. Get out of there.
- AJ, get out of there now.</i>

989
01:04:42,446 --> 01:04:44,513
<i>- AJ... AJ, get out!
- AJ, get out.</i>

990
01:04:44,515 --> 01:04:49,051
<i>Jesus Christ, Mom,
what are you...</i>

991
01:04:49,053 --> 01:04:51,253
<i>God.</i>

992
01:04:51,255 --> 01:04:53,490
<i>All right, all right, um,
all right, listen.</i>

993
01:04:53,492 --> 01:04:55,958
<i>I transferred all of the money, all of
the money into my account, all right?</i>

994
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:57,960
<i>- Just temporarily.
- Why didn't you tell us?</i>

995
01:04:57,962 --> 01:04:59,529
<i>Why, why didn't you try
and warn us?</i>

996
01:04:59,531 --> 01:05:01,364
<i>How could I have
warned you, Damon?</i>

997
01:05:01,366 --> 01:05:03,799
<i>If I did, Amaya would be...</i>

998
01:05:03,801 --> 01:05:05,835
<i>And I just did it
as insurance, all right?</i>

999
01:05:05,837 --> 01:05:07,370
<i>What, what about the laptop?
Isn't that enough insurance?</i>

1000
01:05:07,372 --> 01:05:09,139
<i>He's, he's not gonna hurt
Amaya when you got...</i>

1001
01:05:09,141 --> 01:05:11,474
<i>- Not just Amaya.
- You've got all his evidence!</i>

1002
01:05:11,476 --> 01:05:13,210
<i>Erica Dunne.</i>

1003
01:05:13,212 --> 01:05:14,978
<i>I told him he would get
the money back</i>

1004
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:17,149
<i>once I knew
that she was free too.</i>

1005
01:05:18,284 --> 01:05:19,285
<i>Oh.</i>

1006
01:05:21,321 --> 01:05:24,121
<i>Matty, you are so dead.</i>

1007
01:05:24,123 --> 01:05:26,524
<i>What the hell else
was I supposed to do?</i>

1008
01:05:26,526 --> 01:05:28,326
<i>You saw what he does
to those people.</i>

1009
01:05:28,328 --> 01:05:29,994
<i>What'd you think was gonna
happen? You think he was just</i>

1010
01:05:29,996 --> 01:05:32,966
<i>gonna take the laptop
and walk away?</i>

1011
01:05:35,001 --> 01:05:37,935
<i>I know what
I'm asking you to do is...</i>

1012
01:05:37,937 --> 01:05:39,804
<i>Amaya's gonna be here
in five minutes,</i>

1013
01:05:39,806 --> 01:05:42,574
<i>and I can't promise you that
in those five minutes</i>

1014
01:05:42,576 --> 01:05:45,010
<i>that no one else is gonna
show up at your door,</i>

1015
01:05:45,012 --> 01:05:47,179
<i>but...</i>

1016
01:05:47,181 --> 01:05:50,015
<i>Guys, if we don't do this,
Amaya's...</i>

1017
01:05:50,017 --> 01:05:52,152
<i>Please.</i>

1018
01:06:06,401 --> 01:06:07,433
<i>Okay.</i>

1019
01:06:07,435 --> 01:06:09,971
<i>So, uh, who wants to go first?</i>

1020
01:06:17,113 --> 01:06:18,180
<i>I'll go.</i>

1021
01:06:20,616 --> 01:06:23,052
<i>Yeah, well, that one sucks.</i>

1022
01:06:28,324 --> 01:06:31,225
<i>Um, my gym teacher got fired</i>

1023
01:06:31,227 --> 01:06:32,427
<i>for adding blank</i>

1024
01:06:32,429 --> 01:06:35,232
<i>to the obstacle course.</i>

1025
01:06:44,408 --> 01:06:46,209
<i>Too much cocaine.</i>

1026
01:06:47,445 --> 01:06:49,312
<i>Velcro.</i>

1027
01:06:49,314 --> 01:06:52,350
<i>Uh, depression.</i>

1028
01:06:54,885 --> 01:06:56,185
<i>I like Velcro.</i>

1029
01:06:59,624 --> 01:07:02,126
<i>Thought depression
was pretty good.</i>

1030
01:07:03,528 --> 01:07:05,294
<i>All right, I'll go.</i>

1031
01:07:05,296 --> 01:07:07,364
<i>Uh, or do you wanna go, Damon?</i>

1032
01:07:07,366 --> 01:07:11,100
<i>- Yeah. Yeah, all right.
- Yeah? Um, all right.</i>

1033
01:07:11,102 --> 01:07:14,237
<i>Um, uh, in his new action,</i>

1034
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:17,274
<i>in his new action comedy,
Jackie Chan must fend off</i>

1035
01:07:17,276 --> 01:07:19,242
<i>- ninjas while also...
- Hey, uh, Nari.</i>

1036
01:07:19,244 --> 01:07:22,112
<i>Uh, Nari, we're, we're,
we're trying to play.</i>

1037
01:07:22,114 --> 01:07:24,247
<i>- Uh, uh...
- Sorry.</i>

1038
01:07:24,249 --> 01:07:25,550
<i>A horse with no legs.</i>

1039
01:07:25,552 --> 01:07:28,286
<i>- What, uh, what is...
- Right?</i>

1040
01:07:28,288 --> 01:07:31,191
<i>Uh, go around...
going around punching people.</i>

1041
01:07:32,292 --> 01:07:33,591
<i>- Yeah.
- Yeah.</i>

1042
01:07:33,593 --> 01:07:34,659
<i>That's... you would pick that.</i>

1043
01:07:34,661 --> 01:07:36,494
<i>That's pretty good try.</i>

1044
01:07:36,496 --> 01:07:38,262
<i>Yeah.</i>

1045
01:07:38,264 --> 01:07:39,997
<i>Matias, give me access
to the laptop.</i>

1046
01:07:39,999 --> 01:07:41,466
<i>System Preferences,
Users and Groups,</i>

1047
01:07:41,468 --> 01:07:45,203
<i>Add User, make sure you give me
administrative access.</i>

1048
01:07:45,205 --> 01:07:47,238
<i>Wait, I'm just...
What are you gonna be doing?</i>

1049
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:49,006
<i>I am gonna back-up
all the videos</i>

1050
01:07:49,008 --> 01:07:50,342
<i>and I'm gonna go
through location services,</i>

1051
01:07:50,344 --> 01:07:52,378
<i>in case we can find out
where the laptop's been,</i>

1052
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:54,580
<i>then maybe we can find
the missing girl.</i>

1053
01:07:54,582 --> 01:07:56,048
<i>Wait, what do you mean?</i>

1054
01:07:56,050 --> 01:07:57,282
<i>Are we...
don't worry, okay?</i>

1055
01:07:57,284 --> 01:07:58,951
<i>What are you... what... no.</i>

1056
01:07:58,953 --> 01:08:00,018
<i>You guys, my friend
on the force,</i>

1057
01:08:00,020 --> 01:08:01,220
<i>he's coming over here, so...</i>

1058
01:08:01,222 --> 01:08:02,287
<i>Um...</i>

1059
01:08:02,289 --> 01:08:04,524
<i>Okay.</i>

1060
01:08:04,526 --> 01:08:05,759
<i>Um, blank.</i>

1061
01:08:05,761 --> 01:08:09,095
<i>Awesome in theory,
kind of a mess in practice.</i>

1062
01:08:09,097 --> 01:08:13,233
<i>Um, uh, the swim team,</i>

1063
01:08:13,235 --> 01:08:14,302
<i>all at once.</i>

1064
01:08:17,105 --> 01:08:18,571
<i>Okay, he's gone.
AJ, AJ, AJ,</i>

1065
01:08:18,573 --> 01:08:20,240
<i>as soon as Amaya
gets to my place,</i>

1066
01:08:20,242 --> 01:08:21,709
<i>you disconnect,
and you and your mom</i>

1067
01:08:21,711 --> 01:08:22,909
<i>get the hell out of your house.
All right?</i>

1068
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:25,111
<i>You're the only one
who might not be safe.</i>

1069
01:08:25,113 --> 01:08:27,113
<i>Uh, Damon's in London,
they can't get to him.</i>

1070
01:08:27,115 --> 01:08:28,682
<i>And Nari's got a friend
on the force,</i>

1071
01:08:28,684 --> 01:08:30,351
<i>so, so the cops
are already on their way.</i>

1072
01:08:30,353 --> 01:08:31,419
<i>Okay, listen,</i>

1073
01:08:31,421 --> 01:08:33,387
<i>you guys cannot stay there.</i>

<i>No, no, no.
We're not going to.</i>

1075
01:08:34,557 --> 01:08:35,958
<i>Wait, wait, wait, uh...</i>

1076
01:08:39,429 --> 01:08:41,063
<i>Um...</i>

1077
01:08:49,473 --> 01:08:52,340
<i>Hey, um, Amaya's...
Amaya's gonna be late.</i>

1078
01:08:52,342 --> 01:08:54,443
<i>She says there's something
wrong with the subway.</i>

1079
01:08:54,445 --> 01:08:56,111
<i>Do you, uh... do you guys...</i>

1080
01:08:56,113 --> 01:08:58,380
<i>Can you guys play
a little bit longer?</i>

1081
01:08:58,382 --> 01:09:01,149
<i>- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I, um, totally.</i>

1082
01:09:01,151 --> 01:09:03,286
<i>- Okay.

01:09:04,689 --> 01:09:07,223
<i>- Serena?
- Guys.</i>

1085
01:09:07,225 --> 01:09:08,259
<i>Hello?</i>

1086
01:09:10,228 --> 01:09:14,297
<i>Uh, sorry, guys. Um, Nari's
skipping this round.</i>

1087
01:09:14,299 --> 01:09:18,769
<i>Uh... Matias,
can we play something else?</i>

1088
01:09:18,771 --> 01:09:20,370
<i>I'm getting, getting sick
of this game.</i>

1089
01:09:20,372 --> 01:09:22,306
<i>- How much longer?
- How much longer for...</i>

1090
01:09:22,308 --> 01:09:23,807
<i>Where did the subway
break down?</i>

1091
01:09:23,809 --> 01:09:26,677
<i>Let me... let me just...
let me ask.</i>

1092

<i>Bathroom.
She's not feeling well.</i>

1097
01:09:43,062 --> 01:09:44,431
<i>Might be a while.</i>

1098
01:09:56,343 --> 01:09:58,811
<i>Oh, you know what, fuck around
all you want, asshole!</i>

1099
01:09:58,813 --> 01:10:01,145

<i>I'm coming! I'm coming!</i>

1148
01:11:56,970 --> 01:11:58,436
<i>- No! AJ!
- No! No! No!</i>

1149
01:11:58,438 --> 01:11:59,838
<i>- AJ! No!
- Stay on the ground.</i>

1150
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,941
<i>- No. AJ!
- Don't! AJ!</i>

1151
01:12:01,943 --> 01:12:03,976
<i>- No! No, no, no. Stay!
- No!</i>

1152
01:12:03,978 --> 01:12:06,746
<i>AJ! No! AJ!</i>

1153
01:12:06,748 --> 01:12:09,582
<i>No! No! No!</i>

1154
01:12:09,584 --> 01:12:10,650
<i>Gun, gun!</i>

1155
01:12:14,889 --> 01:12:16,724
<i>Oh, my...</i>

1156
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:23,964
<i>Suspect down.</i>

1157
01:12:35,878 --> 01:12:37,613
<i>Oh, AJ.</i>

1158
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:43,450
<i>No.</i>

1159
01:12:43,452 --> 01:12:44,554
<i>Fuck.</i>

1160
01:12:46,723 --> 01:12:48,591
<i>Matias, Damon...</i>

1161
01:12:54,264 --> 01:12:55,496
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

1162
01:12:55,498 --> 01:12:57,331
<i>Oh.</i>

1163
01:12:57,333 --> 01:12:58,733
<i>He's gonna kill Amaya</i>

1164
01:12:58,735 --> 01:13:00,501
<i>as soon as that train
reaches the station.</i>

1165
01:13:00,503 --> 01:13:02,370
<i>No, Nari is on her way there
right now.</i>

1166
01:13:02,372 --> 01:13:03,906
<i>- What?
- Yeah, she's gonna try</i>

1167
01:13:03,908 --> 01:13:05,474
<i>and get there before
they can get to her.</i>

1168
01:13:05,476 --> 01:13:06,942
<i>I can...
I can get there faster.</i>

1169
01:13:06,944 --> 01:13:08,345
<i>I'm gonna go now.</i>

1170
01:13:11,682 --> 01:13:13,382
<i>What...</i>

1171
01:13:13,384 --> 01:13:14,685
<i>what's going on?</i>

1172
01:13:35,674 --> 01:13:38,310
<i>Bye, love you.</i>

1173
01:13:39,311 --> 01:13:41,311
<i>So, here's the only thing.</i>

1174
01:13:41,313 --> 01:13:42,680
<i>We were gonna tell them
tonight,</i>

1175
01:13:42,682 --> 01:13:43,848
<i>and over Skype.</i>

1176
01:13:43,850 --> 01:13:45,382
<i>Do you wanna...</i>

1177
01:13:45,384 --> 01:13:46,751
<i>Do you wanna not
tell them tonight or,</i>

1178
01:13:46,753 --> 01:13:49,019
<i>- or what...
- No, it's perfect,</i>

1179
01:13:49,021 --> 01:13:50,088
<i>because this way,</i>

1180
01:13:50,090 --> 01:13:53,359
<i>Damon gets to be there
for the news.</i>

1181
01:13:54,527 --> 01:13:56,460
<i>AJ will be fine.
He's a big boy.</i>

1182
01:13:56,462 --> 01:13:58,063
<i>- Uh-hmm.
- He's a big boy.</i>

1183
01:13:58,065 --> 01:14:00,098
<i>Big boy that'll
probably show up a lot</i>

1184
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:01,733
<i>in symbolic protests.</i>

1185
01:14:01,735 --> 01:14:03,835
<i>That's probably true.</i>

1186
01:14:03,837 --> 01:14:05,370
<i>On a white horse.</i>

1187
01:14:05,372 --> 01:14:07,672
<i>- Like, he would love that.
- Yeah.</i>

1188
01:14:07,674 --> 01:14:08,940
<i>Or with a boom-box.</i>

1189
01:14:08,942 --> 01:14:12,711
<i>Just John Cusack style.</i>

1190
01:14:12,713 --> 01:14:14,579
<i>And then we can put him
at your parents' table.</i>

1191
01:14:14,581 --> 01:14:17,752
<i>That'll be all the energy
we all need.</i>

1192
01:14:21,422 --> 01:14:23,558
<i>They're not coming, so....</i>

1193
01:14:28,363 --> 01:14:30,663
<i>You think they would magically
change their minds</i>

1194
01:14:30,665 --> 01:14:32,833
<i>and become modern?</i>

1195
01:14:32,835 --> 01:14:36,437
<i>I mean, I'm just...
their only daughter, so...</i>

1196
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:38,605
<i>My mom.</i>

1197
01:14:38,607 --> 01:14:40,140
<i>No, your mom's gonna be okay.</i>

1198
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:42,910
<i>- No. Nari.
- She's... No, she has to be.</i>

1199
01:14:44,814 --> 01:14:47,449
<i>She's never gonna leave
that hospital.</i>

1200
01:14:49,685 --> 01:14:50,985
<i>Well, then, then,</i>

1201
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:53,721
<i>let's, let's get married
tonight in her room,</i>

1202
01:14:53,723 --> 01:14:56,591
<i>and, and we can bring
the paperwork and...</i>

1203
01:14:56,593 --> 01:14:57,357
<i>In the ICU?</i>

1204
01:14:57,359 --> 01:14:58,827
<i>And she'll be our witness.</i>

1205
01:14:58,829 --> 01:14:59,863
<i>Yes, yes.</i>

1206
01:15:02,065 --> 01:15:04,334
<i>I love that idea.</i>

1207
01:15:05,969 --> 01:15:07,604
<i>But it's not the point.</i>

1208
01:15:09,073 --> 01:15:11,575
<i>I don't want you
to have to choose</i>

1209
01:15:12,977 --> 01:15:14,610
<i>between me and them.</i>

1210
01:15:14,612 --> 01:15:16,879
<i>That's...</i>

1211
01:15:16,881 --> 01:15:18,482
<i>It's not fair.</i>

1212
01:15:23,621 --> 01:15:26,488
<i>I don't want you
to have to choose.</i>

1213
01:15:26,490 --> 01:15:28,826
<i>I don't want you
to have to choose.</i>

1214
01:15:34,066 --> 01:15:36,902
<i>Wait, it's... That's Nari.</i>

1215
01:15:48,181 --> 01:15:51,481
<i>Wait.
Who, who, who is that?</i>

1216
01:15:51,483 --> 01:15:52,919
<i>That's my mom.</i>

1217
01:16:00,026 --> 01:16:01,692
<i>Oh, God!</i>

1218
01:16:07,467 --> 01:16:09,600
<i>No, no, no! No, no!</i>

1219
01:16:09,602 --> 01:16:10,802
<i>I will do anything.</i>

1220
01:16:10,804 --> 01:16:12,004
<i>Stop this right now!</i>

1221
01:16:12,006 --> 01:16:13,406
<i>I will do any...</i>

1222
01:16:16,210 --> 01:16:17,542
<i>Please!</i>

1223
01:16:17,544 --> 01:16:19,678
<i>Please, don't do this.</i>

1224
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:21,813
<i>You can have me.
I don't care,</i>

1225
01:16:21,815 --> 01:16:23,815
<i>just, please, stop!</i>

1226
01:16:23,817 --> 01:16:25,118
<i>Please, please,</i>

1227
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:27,954
<i>please, please!</i>

1228
01:16:27,956 --> 01:16:29,822
<i>Oh, God!</i>

1229
01:16:33,094 --> 01:16:35,862
<i>No!</i>

1230
01:16:35,864 --> 01:16:37,997
<i>No, I can't.</i>

1231
01:16:37,999 --> 01:16:39,999
<i>I can't.</i>

1232
01:16:40,001 --> 01:16:41,971
<i>I can't.</i>

1233
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:46,574
<i>No, no.</i>

1234
01:16:48,610 --> 01:16:50,911
<i>No.</i>

1235
01:16:50,913 --> 01:16:51,914
<i>I won't.</i>

1236
01:17:00,257 --> 01:17:01,289
<i>No!</i>

1237
01:17:02,758 --> 01:17:04,527
<i>Nari.</i>

1238
01:17:06,129 --> 01:17:08,763
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1239
01:17:08,765 --> 01:17:10,634
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1240
01:17:12,936 --> 01:17:13,937
<i>No.</i>

1241
01:17:17,908 --> 01:17:19,141
<i>No.</i>

1242
01:17:19,143 --> 01:17:20,709
<i>No!</i>

1243
01:17:20,711 --> 01:17:21,776
<i>Dammit!</i>

1244
01:17:21,778 --> 01:17:22,912
<i>No!</i>

1245
01:17:22,914 --> 01:17:25,081
<i>Oh, God!</i>

1246
01:17:25,083 --> 01:17:26,718
<i>No!</i>

1247
01:17:30,121 --> 01:17:32,655
<i>No!</i>

1248
01:17:32,657 --> 01:17:34,757
<i>Nari!</i>

1249
01:17:34,759 --> 01:17:36,826
<i>Nari!</i>

1250
01:17:36,828 --> 01:17:38,796
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1251
01:17:41,333 --> 01:17:42,766
<i>I'm sorry, Serena,</i>

1252
01:17:42,768 --> 01:17:44,502
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1253
01:17:47,573 --> 01:17:49,906
<i>Serena, Serena,
get out of there right now!</i>

1254
01:17:49,908 --> 01:17:51,342
<i>Serena,
oh, get out of there.</i>

1255
01:17:51,344 --> 01:17:52,943
<i>Serena, get out of there
right now!</i>

1256
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:03,921
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1257
01:18:16,803 --> 01:18:17,568
<i>Listen to me.</i>

1258
01:18:17,570 --> 01:18:19,238
<i>I want you to listen to me,</i>

1259
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:21,641
<i>whoever I'm talking
to right now.</i>

1260
01:18:22,343 --> 01:18:24,176
<i>Amaya, my...</i>

1261
01:18:24,178 --> 01:18:26,779
<i>She has nothing to do
with any of this, okay?</i>

1262
01:18:26,781 --> 01:18:28,247
<i>She hasn't even...
she doesn't even know</i>

1263
01:18:28,249 --> 01:18:30,250
<i>I found the laptop,
all right?</i>

1264
01:18:30,252 --> 01:18:32,051
<i>The guy who lost it...
the guy who lost it,</i>

1265
01:18:32,053 --> 01:18:34,087
<i>he's, he's on the subway train
with her.</i>

1266
01:18:34,089 --> 01:18:35,221
<i>He's wearing a gray hoodie,</i>

1267
01:18:35,223 --> 01:18:36,789
<i>this is all his fault, okay?</i>

1268
01:18:36,791 --> 01:18:39,761
<i>She has nothing,
nothing to do with it!</i>

1269
01:18:41,096 --> 01:18:43,196
<i>Please!</i>

1270
01:18:43,198 --> 01:18:45,131
<i>I'll delete everything, okay?</i>

1271
01:18:45,133 --> 01:18:47,667
<i>You'll have nothing
to trace back to me, I swear.</i>

1272
01:18:47,669 --> 01:18:50,672
<i>If, if you kill him...</i>

1273
01:18:51,807 --> 01:18:53,240
<i>I don't care what you do to me,</i>

1274
01:18:53,242 --> 01:18:54,808
<i>I don't care what you do to me,</i>

1275
01:18:54,810 --> 01:18:58,081
<i>but just please leave Amaya
out of this!</i>

1276
01:19:41,226 --> 01:19:42,927
<i>No, no, no,
no, no, no.</i>

1277
01:19:44,396 --> 01:19:46,296
<i>Baby...</i>

1278
01:19:46,298 --> 01:19:47,732
<i>okay?</i>

1279
01:19:56,775 --> 01:19:59,109
<i>What?
Slow, slow, slow, slow.</i>

1280
01:19:59,111 --> 01:20:00,112
<i>Slow.</i>

1281
01:20:07,820 --> 01:20:08,854
<i>Um...</i>

1282
01:20:19,432 --> 01:20:21,099
<i>Go, go.</i>

1283
01:20:21,101 --> 01:20:23,835
<i>Go, go.</i>

1284
01:20:23,837 --> 01:20:26,070
<i>All right, uh,
you're going to get her, man?</i>

1285
01:20:26,072 --> 01:20:27,439
<i>Yeah, I am.</i>

1286
01:20:27,441 --> 01:20:29,508
<i>All right, just make sure
you leave the computer open</i>

1287
01:20:29,510 --> 01:20:31,043
<i>because I got to keep
downloading the video files.</i>

1288
01:20:31,045 --> 01:20:33,479
<i>- Uh, okay.
- Now, Matias, just be careful,</i>

1289
01:20:33,481 --> 01:20:36,017
<i>- yeah?
- Yeah.</i>

1290
01:20:54,303 --> 01:20:56,171
<i>You're there, aren't you?</i>

1291
01:21:03,045 --> 01:21:05,114
<i>Guess what?
I have been recording.</i>

1292
01:21:06,249 --> 01:21:07,883
<i>I've got the whole thing.</i>

1293
01:21:09,319 --> 01:21:12,053
<i>You should have dealt
with Matias.</i>

1294
01:21:12,055 --> 01:21:14,055
<i>He was gonna give
the computer back.</i>

1295
01:21:14,057 --> 01:21:17,058
<i>He was gonna give it back
and forget the whole thing,</i>

1296
01:21:17,060 --> 01:21:19,195
<i>but that is not
what I'm gonna do.</i>

1297
01:21:23,334 --> 01:21:24,533
<i>You see this?</i>

1298
01:21:24,535 --> 01:21:26,268
<i>Do you know what this is?</i>

1299
01:21:26,270 --> 01:21:27,436
<i>This is coordinates.</i>

1300
01:21:27,438 --> 01:21:29,504
<i>This is everywhere
that computer has been.</i>

1301
01:21:29,506 --> 01:21:31,440
<i>This is going to lead them
to Erica Dunne,</i>

1302
01:21:31,442 --> 01:21:33,275
<i>and every single girl you took.</i>

1303
01:21:33,277 --> 01:21:34,778
<i>You are finished!</i>

1304
01:22:09,315 --> 01:22:10,950
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1305
01:22:25,532 --> 01:22:27,265
<i>- Damon, Damon, what's up?
- Matias,</i>

1306
01:22:27,267 --> 01:22:29,334
<i>Matias, he didn't lose
the laptop.</i>

1307
01:22:29,336 --> 01:22:31,236
<i>Charon IV, he left it
there deliberately.</i>

1308
01:22:31,238 --> 01:22:33,606
<i>He wanted it to be found.
They all wanted it to be found.</i>

1309
01:22:33,608 --> 01:22:36,375
<i>See, it was a lure.
They were phishing.</i>

1310
01:22:36,377 --> 01:22:38,943
<i>Uh, from the moment you entered
your Wi-Fi password,</i>

1311
01:22:38,945 --> 01:22:41,080
<i>they were in, they've had
control this whole time.</i>

1312
01:22:41,082 --> 01:22:43,182
<i>Damon, I'm sorry,
but what are you...</i>

1313
01:22:43,184 --> 01:22:44,583
<i>It was a lie.</i>

1314
01:22:44,585 --> 01:22:46,287
<i>They're setting us up.</i>

1315
01:22:48,122 --> 01:22:49,889
<i>We did everything
they wanted us to do.</i>

1316
01:22:49,891 --> 01:22:52,160
<i>We moved the money.
