1
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,286
( Blender whirrs)

2
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,033
( buzzing )

3
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,656
( country music playing )

4
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:47,644
(woman singing)

5
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:04,887
(dialing )

6
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,704
It's me, hon.

7
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:16,297
Listen, I'm in a hell
of a bind here.

8
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,707
I got more problems
than I could deal with on my own.

9
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:20,870
I need you to come on over.

10
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,473
For Pete's sake, it's nothing
I'd care to discuss over the phone.

11
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,142
Would you just
get yourself over here?

12
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:45,124
Radio DJ:
It's a fine day today, folks.

13
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:46,660
It's 1931 --

14
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,969
145 years to the day

15
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:52,465
since our great state of Texas
declared its independence.

16
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:55,240
And, boy, I got some Texas tunes
to play for you today.

17
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:57,544
This is 97.9 Country,

18
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,846
coming at you
like a rattlesnake.

19
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,647
Lorna.

20
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,676
I came as soon
as I hung up the phone.

21
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,451
Oh.

22
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,220
For heaven's sake,

23
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,228
whatever's happened
to Dale?

24
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,287
( Sighs )
Dale's fine.

25
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:15,925
I just knocked him over the head
with Mama's cast-iron skillet-

26
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:18,629
nothing a bag of ice
can't take care of.

27
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,604
Jesus, Lorna.

28
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,629
What did you go
and do that for?

29
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,664
I was just trying
to have a polite conversation

30
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:26,768
between two married
individuals,

31
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,801
but you know Dale.

32
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:31,941
You can't have a civil debate with
the man without things turning ugly.

33
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:34,349
Well, Dale was never one for polite
conversation, that's for damn sure.

34
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,376
Forget about Dale.

35
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:39,322
I got more pressing matters on my plate
than his bruised head.

36
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:40,756
What's going on?

37
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,954
( Exhales )
It's a wild story, Tiny--

38
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:46,657
a real wild story.
You ain't gonna believe it.

39
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:50,065
No, you know me, Lorna.
I believe in stories-

40
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:52,296
probably why I get myself
into so much trouble.

41
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,535
You hear about this?

42
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:57,905
- The bank robbery down in Red County?
- Mm-hmm.

43
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,240
It's been all over the news
what happened two days ago.

44
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,143
The police is out still looking
for who done it.

45
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:05,479
You can't turn on the damn TV
without hearing something about it.

46
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:08,952
A man wearing a stocking
over his head

47
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,785
just waltzed into
Waldorf Savings & Loan,

48
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,813
tossed a bag on the counter,

49
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:16,827
pointed a revolver
at the cashier and said,

50
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:20,592
"Good morning there.
It's your time to shine.

51
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,658
Fill the satchel, hit the floor,
and all will be well."

52
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,102
I heard a heck of a lot of money
has gone missing.

53
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,867
$100,000, all cash.

54
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:32,707
I didn't think there was that kind of
money in the whole state of Texas,

55
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:35,076
never mind a bank
in Red County.

56
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:39,943
- Go ahead, have one of mine.
- Mm-mm, those things will kill you.

57
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:42,316
Them light cigarettes
you smoke

58
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,219
will kill you just the same,
only slower.

59
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:46,245
Don't hound me
for trying to buy

60
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,850
a little bit of extra time
on this earth

61
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:51,259
in case something worthwhile
comes up.

62
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:58,462
Now tell me about
this great robbery.

63
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:01,028
I know who went and done it.

64
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,062
You what?

65
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,767
I know who done it, Tiny.

66
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:11,607
It seems that Dale here

67
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:13,207
forgot to make me privy

68
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:16,743
of certain unsavory activities
in the last few days.

69
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:18,778
( Tiny scoffs )

70
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:21,587
You mean Dale
gone and robbed that bank?

71
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:23,423
That's exactly what I mean.

72
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:25,895
Lorna, just because a man
held up a convenience store

73
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:29,627
a couple of times
in his more wild and woolly days

74
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:31,896
don't mean he's a bank robber.

75
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:34,404
- Five.
- Five?

76
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,429
He robbed five
convenience stores.

77
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:40,308
It was high time he graduated
to something bigger.

78
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,676
How are you so sure
he done it?

79
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,746
You know why they call it
Red County?

80
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,375
Why?

81
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,148
On account of the iron ore
in the soil,

82
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:51,712
makes all the dirt red
down there.

83
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:56,622
Lorna, now he could have
picked up that dirt from anywhere.

84
00:06:56,649 --> 00:07:00,620
Tiny, the soles of them boots are redder
than an Indian'-s face in the sun.

85
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:04,362
That is Red County soil,
that's for damn sure.

86
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,462
And Dale's got no business
in Red County,

87
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,404
not to mention

88
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,171
that I only got me
one good pair of hose,

89
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:14,200
and they're nowhere
to be found.

90
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:18,079
( Chuckles )
He went and took his wife's own hose.

91
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,708
Can you believe the nerves
of that man?

92
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:23,152
He probably expects
I was never gonna find out.

93
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:26,555
God, if dumb was dirt,

94
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,616
Dale would cover
about an acre.

95
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:34,728
So I called me Mr. Gale
down at Gale & Sons-

96
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:38,292
you know, where he works selling
them modular kitchen cabinets.

97
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:42,538
You know what
Mr. Gale tells me?

98
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:45,304
I hope you enjoy
Gardendale, Lorna.

99
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:47,038
Gardendale?

100
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,706
That's near Lamar County.

101
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,874
Seems like Dale here

102
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:54,441
filed for a transfer
two days ago.

103
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,646
He what?

104
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,416
Mm-hmm.
Ain't that a hoot?

105
00:07:57,443 --> 00:08:01,084
Figured he'd skip town without
so much as raising an eyebrow.

106
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:04,651
It don't take much
to flee to Mexico from there.

107
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:07,255
- Son of a bitch.
- Yeah, my sentiments exactly.

108
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:17,202
$100.000. Tiny--

109
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,733
that is a hell of a lot
of money.

110
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:23,076
And he wasn't gonna share
a penny of it.

111
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,212
What are you gonna do
about it?

112
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,653
I figured I'd rather split that money
with a good friend

113
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,623
than let that thieving dog of a husband
get away with it.

114
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:36,490
I ain't gonna sit here
and disagree with that.

115
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,296
- But one thing.
- What's that?

116
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,035
Where's the money?

117
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:50,374
That's what I'm fixing
to find out.

118
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:59,282
( Exclaims )
What the hell?

119
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:00,716
Welcome back, hon.

120
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,310
( Country music playing )

121
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:03,513
Oh, what's going on?

122
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,921
Sorry, Dale, but we got
pressing matters to discuss

123
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,856
and I need the benefit
of restraints.

124
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,484
You know how you can get.

125
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:12,121
(grunts )You get me out of here
right this minute,

126
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:15,621
or I swear I will kick in every single
one of your teeth one at a time, Lorna.

127
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,931
No need to get
confrontational now, Dale.

128
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,459
( Exhales )

129
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,530
I need you to talk
and I need you to be composed.

130
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,166
I will give you composed.

131
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:25,675
What did I tell you?

132
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:28,269
- Not gonna give it up without a fight.
- Mm-mm.

133
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,542
What the hell is she
doing here?

134
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,572
I needed a friend.

135
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:35,950
When you find out that the man that you
love is nothing but a rattling snake,

136
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,716
sometimes a friend
is all you got.

137
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,154
Amen, Lorna.

138
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:40,816
What are the two of you
on about?

139
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:43,258
We're talking about the great robbery
in Red County.

140
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,858
What, you didn't think
I was gonna find out?

141
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,527
I--

142
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,503
- Ask him where's the money.
- Where's the money, Dale?

143
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:56,029
Wh-- what money?

144
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:58,133
The $100,000 in cash

145
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,644
you confiscated
from the Waldorf Savings & Loan.

146
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:04,079
I don't know nothing about
no Waldorf Savings & Loan.

147
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,515
You didn't know about the string
of convenience store robberies neither

148
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:07,847
- three years ago.
- That's right.

149
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:10,012
Like hell you didn't.
You even went and robbed

150
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,352
Ophenius Dunn's
feed warehouse, Dale.

151
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,756
That was Mama's
second husband.

152
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,623
Did you think he wasn't gonna
identify you?

153
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,686
Well, I did not expect
his identification of me

154
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,459
on account
he wears trifocals.

155
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:23,194
I did my three years.
I paid my debt to society.

156
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:25,498
God damn you, Dale.

157
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:28,630
You promised me.
You looked me straight in the eye

158
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:31,198
and you gave me your word
you were done with your criminal ways.

159
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,641
I am.
That's a fact.

160
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:35,168
I ain't in the business
of getting in trouble no more.

161
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:38,739
I'm straight as a duck
with two good wings.

162
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,216
Is that right?

163
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:42,241
Cross my heart
and hope to die.

164
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:45,380
Nothing but the joy
of modular cabinetry

165
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:47,948
to keep me
righteously occupied.

166
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:53,662
Well, then you'll gladly tell me

167
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:57,361
what that is
on the soles of your boots.

168
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,562
What?

169
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,965
Do you know why they call it
Red County, Dale?

170
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:06,873
No.

171
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:10,244
On account of the iron ore
in the soil.

172
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:13,045
Iron ore in the soil?

173
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:15,279
Ho-ho! Whoo!

174
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:19,084
You sure got a hell of
a fervent imagination, Lorna.

175
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,583
Did I imagine this?

176
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:27,629
Where in hell did you get
a peashooter like that?

177
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:30,224
I got it where I get all the things
you're trying to hide from me--

178
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:32,258
underneath the floorboard
in the bathroom.

179
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,604
I've never seen that before
in my life.

180
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:36,936
You're lying.

181
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:39,306
What would you
base that statement on?

182
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:41,470
On the fact that you never tell
nothing but lies.

183
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,276
You was lying before you learned
how to talk.

184
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:47,580
Nothing but the pure gospel truth
ever passed these lips.

185
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:49,813
So you're telling me

186
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:52,152
that you don't know nothing
about no robbery.

187
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,454
I know nothing about
the robbery.

188
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,482
And you ain't never seen
this gun before?

189
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:58,358
Yes, ma'am.

190
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:03,690
For crying out loud,
where are my nerve tablets?

191
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,536
( Exhales )

192
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,639
What are you looking at?

193
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,583
You got your mama's legs.

194
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,779
Mama's got
real pretty legs.

195
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:25,584
They're long and white
like Milkybars.

196
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:28,717
Mm, I always did want
to bed your mama.

197
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,024
- God damn you, Dale.
- I'm an honest man.

198
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,654
I swear to God,

199
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:35,859
if you have got
the slightest shine for your life,

200
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:38,334
I suggest you tell me
where that money is,

201
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:41,031
as I will not be responsible
for my ensuing ways.

202
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,334
- Now wait just a minute.
- What?

203
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:44,637
- You can't shoot him.
- Why the hell not?

204
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:53,139
We are talking about
a lot of money here, Tiny.

205
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,776
Tiny: Right.

206
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,684
Lorna: And Dale here

207
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:00,816
is one hell
of a pertinacious individual.

208
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:02,052
Come on now.

209
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:04,994
He's gonna need a lot of coaxing
to get that information out of him.

210
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:07,395
Lorna, I guess he is
your husband.

211
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:12,367
You go ahead and shoot him.
It ain't none of my business.

212
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:13,734
-( Cocks gun )
- Oh, wait.

213
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,433
-( Gunshot)
-( Dale screams)

214
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,942
No need to turn
belligerent now.

215
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,467
(whimpers)

216
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,411
You ready to talk
like civilized folks?

217
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:25,915
You know me--
nothing but civilized.

218
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:27,383
Honey, you scared me.

219
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:30,751
- You stole that money.
- I did not take that money.

220
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:32,847
- Damn it.
- Argh! I took that money.

221
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:36,587
Damn it, Dale, why the hell
did you go and do that for?

222
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:38,151
It's in my blood.

223
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,858
I can't seem to stay away
from institutions

224
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:44,163
that contain any significant amount
of legal tender.

225
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,760
Oh, Jesus.

226
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,670
But I was gonna tell you all about it
when the time was right.

227
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,640
Oh, and when would that be?
When you're good and gone?

228
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,802
You never had a lick of confidence
in me, Lorna.

229
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,142
That's what I'm talking about.
That's one of my beefs.

230
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:59,172
I just figured a woman didn't need
to trouble her pretty little head

231
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:01,276
with financial matters.

232
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:04,880
And I-- I-- I was working on it.

233
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,652
That's a man's job anyway.

234
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,752
You just let good old Dale
take care of the details,

235
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:13,229
and it will all work out
just dandy.

236
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:16,529
Nothing ever works out just dandy
when you're concerned, Dale.

237
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:19,661
I admit the whims of fate
have plotted against me in the past,

238
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,468
but I sense the winds
of good fortune

239
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:25,031
are finally blowing
my merry way.

240
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:27,066
To hell with your winds, Dale.

241
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:29,079
All I care about is that money.

242
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:30,478
Now where is it?

243
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:33,574
A safe place.
Just get these restraints off me

244
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,415
and I'll take you right to it.
I'll tell you everything.

245
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,443
Oh, not a chance in hell.

246
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:39,717
Well, we're gonna have
to cooperate on this one, Lorna.

247
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:41,190
It is a tit for tat here.

248
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,783
He's not gonna talk.

249
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,658
No, I don't think he is.

250
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:46,492
You're gonna have to
shoot him again.

251
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:48,657
- I think I just might.
- Now hang on there.

252
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:52,863
If there is one thing I learned
from being married to you for 17 years,

253
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,634
it's that I know you
like the back of my hand.

254
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:58,964
Wait a minute.

255
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:01,444
I figured out
you stole that money.

256
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:02,468
Oh.

257
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:05,482
And I can figure out where you hid it,
with or without your help.

258
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,611
What? What? What?

259
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:13,249
Oh, I don't believe it.

260
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,280
What?

261
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:15,883
It's right here
in this house, ain't it?

262
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,155
- No, it's not.
- The money's here?

263
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:18,183
No, it's not.

264
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,857
Oh, my God.
( laughs)

265
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:22,888
Leave it to Dale.

266
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,926
Who would be foolish enough
to leave the stolen money

267
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,733
right here
in his own domicile?

268
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,831
It's not here, I swear to God
and all the angels.

269
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:31,535
What did I tell you, Tiny?

270
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:34,100
I married a lying, cheating-

271
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,340
(gunshot)

272
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:38,814
-( distant dog barking )
-( blood pattering )

273
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,410
Shit.

274
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,116
Lorna.

275
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,152
Yeah?

276
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:59,465
Did you just go and kill Dale?

277
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:04,173
I do believe I just did.

278
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,943
Oh, my God, Lorna.

279
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,676
Oh, my God.

280
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:13,877
L-- I-- I-- I didn't know
what happened.

281
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,715
I was just
holding the gun like--

282
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:18,915
Well, Jesus, just put it down,
will you?

283
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:21,618
L-- I didn't mean to do it.

284
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,957
I just get so worked up
about all this business.

285
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,691
- The gun just went off.
- Holy Jesus.

286
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,058
Dale's dead.

287
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,061
Well, I can see that
for myself, Tiny.

288
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:37,097
Oh, my God, Lorna,
you went and killed Dale.

289
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:39,234
(whimpering)

290
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,504
( radio DJ speaking )

291
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:46,209
Okay.

292
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:48,616
DJ: And now for something
really special.

293
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:05,031
All right now.

294
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,594
- Okay.
- Wh--? Wh--?

295
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:10,334
What's done is done.
Everything is gonna be

296
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,364
just fine.

297
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,571
We gotta keep our
heads together.

298
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:17,970
That's nice.

299
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:19,505
That's all better.

300
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:23,980
Now this is no time
to be losing our wit.

301
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:26,580
We got ourselves
a dead body here.

302
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,153
What are we supposed to do?

303
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:32,025
Well, I don't know, Tiny.

304
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,429
I've never dealt
with a dead body before.

305
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:36,490
I thought you might,
because you're the one that killed him.

306
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,593
( Hisses )
Well, it was an accident.

307
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:44,066
We've got a hell of a situation
on our hands here, Lorna.

308
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,236
Oh, Jesus.

309
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:51,305
L-- I--

310
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:53,543
I can't stand for him to stare
at me like that.

311
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,882
- Would you do something?
- Me?

312
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,819
I think I got something.

313
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:00,881
Uh...

314
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:10,397
This ought to do it.

315
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,025
Here.

316
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:15,797
No. What do you want me
to do with that?

317
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:17,398
Put it over his head,
would you?

318
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,404
You do it.
You-- you just wait a minute.

319
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,504
I can't stand him
staring at me like that.

320
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,742
- Well, then why don't you do it?
- Because I shot him.

321
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,375
You gotta put the bag
over his head.

322
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:29,044
My God, can I have
a little bit of help here?

323
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:30,815
Do I have to do
everything myself?!

324
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,935
Ugh.

325
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:53,066
Well, that's a bit better.

326
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,269
Better?

327
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:02,551
Lorna, that bag
does not hide the fact

328
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:04,485
that there's a dead man
underneath it!

329
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,217
Oh.

330
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:08,748
I never graduated high school
or nothing.

331
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,056
Just give me a moment
to think.

332
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,704
(dialing phone)

333
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,811
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

334
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,409
I'm gonna call the police.

335
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,579
Are you out of your mind?

336
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:40,488
It was an accident.
The gun just went off.

337
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,788
Tiny, we are in Texas.

338
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:44,794
There are no accidents.

339
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:47,228
There's alive and there's dead.

340
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,296
You didn't mean to kill him.

341
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,931
Who's gonna believe that?

342
00:19:56,962 --> 00:20:00,842
We got a dead man tied to a chair
and $100,000 missing.

343
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,642
We're gonna look real good in court
explaining that story.

344
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:06,206
We? What do you mean, we?

345
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:07,876
I didn't kill nobody.

346
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:09,442
You think they'd care
to split that hair?

347
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:12,387
You was here when it happened,
and that's all they need to know

348
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,516
to lock us both away
for a real long time.

349
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:24,827
Well, you think it was
self-defense of some kind?

350
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,505
Well, I ain't no officer of the law
or nothing,

351
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:32,805
but we got a man
tied to a chair.

352
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:35,744
He don't seem to pose
no immediate threat, now do he?

353
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,408
(Tiny sighs)

354
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:40,644
Jesus Christ, Tiny.

355
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:44,848
I don't know nothing
about no self-defense.

356
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:47,755
It could be first-degree murder,
for all we know.

357
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,623
( Sighs ) Look, that money
is here somewhere.

358
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:52,959
We got a whole new life
to look forward to.

359
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,761
I am not gonna spend it in a goddamn
cell, I can promise you that.

360
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:13,114
You know,

361
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:16,278
I remember hearing a story
growing up.

362
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,151
What story?

363
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:22,018
My daddy worked the oil fields
in Houston

364
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:24,084
before he moved out here.

365
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,357
Well, it was a while back.

366
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:28,956
He'd just started out
as afield landsman

367
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,989
when one of the wells
he was working on

368
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:33,060
just went and blew up.

369
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:35,264
Three men was buried alive.

370
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:40,101
They tried like hell
to get them out.

371
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,806
Daddy said
he could hear them

372
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:45,644
crying for help down there
the first day.

373
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:50,042
But by the second day,

374
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:53,249
they didn't hear
a darn thing stirring.

375
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:55,189
They figured
they'd dig them out

376
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:57,454
and give them
a proper burial, right?

377
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,858
But when they
got to them,

378
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:05,130
there wasn't much left
to do anything proper with.

379
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,932
What happened?

380
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,137
Bugs.

381
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:14,471
Bugs?

382
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,412
Them Texas bugs
done got to them.

383
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,072
No kidding.

384
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:22,677
Oh, yeah.

385
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,621
Them Texas bugs can eat
right through a metal can

386
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:28,284
if there's something tasty
to get inside at.

387
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:30,793
They got jaws
like lawn mowers.

388
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:34,457
They just up and left
nothing behind.

389
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:36,625
I never knew
bugs could do that.

390
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:41,201
Such is the wonderment-s
of nature, Tiny.

391
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:47,038
So you're thinking...

392
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:49,067
I'm thinking.

393
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:52,742
What if we was to bury Dale
out there like them oil riggers?

394
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:54,444
- Go on.
- Chances are,

395
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:57,215
no one would ever find him
in any recognizable form.

396
00:22:57,242 --> 00:23:00,746
I mean, it's a big stretch
of desert out there.

397
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:03,453
Full of all types
of carnivorous critters.

398
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:06,554
Right. Earth to earth,
dust to dust and all that.

399
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:08,587
- That ain't a hell of a bad idea.
- Mm-hmm.

400
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,622
But it's gonna have to wait.

401
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:11,827
Why?

402
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,928
Because we gotta find us
that money.

403
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:16,599
And I figure that we don't got
a lot of time.

Dale was afraid of rats.

409
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,761

00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:37,811
Keep looking.

429
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:41,689
Radio DJ: And now a great tune
to make your day even better.

430
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:44,023
How are you so sure
the money is even here?

431
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:46,620
'Cause I know Dale.
The money's here. I'm sure of it.

432
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:52,633
$100.000.

433
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:57,106
I can't even imagine
what that might look like.

434
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:01,075
Yeah, it's more money than this town
has ever seen, that's for damn sure.

435
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:04,046
You ever think about
what you'd do with that kind of money?

436
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:06,242
I'd get the hell out of this place,
for one.

437
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:11,917
Anyplace you ever thought
about going?

438
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:15,151
I never really thought
about it.

439
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:19,390
I guess I figured
I'd never really get out of here.

440
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:22,921
Getting out of this town
is all I ever think about.

441
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:25,765
(sighs)

442
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:28,634
You know, I hear
Odessa can be really nice

443
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,402
if you know
your way around.

444
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:33,030
Hmm.

445
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:33,372


446
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:48,019
-( Distant dog barking )
-( car approaching)

447
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,754
Sounds like we got company.

448
00:25:57,689 --> 00:26:00,568
( gasps )
Holy shit, Tiny. It's the law.

449
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:03,334
How did they get here
so quick?

450
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:05,136
Lorna: Oh, who else but Dale
would hold up a bank

451
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:07,074
and hide out in their own home
with all the evidence.

452
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:09,203
I told you it was just
a matter of time

453
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,840
before they suspected
I was married to a bona fide fool.

454
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,679
What are we gonna do?

455
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,213
-( Both sigh )
- Shit.

456
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,018
Come on, this way.
Just you push and I pull.

457
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:21,786
Come on now.

458
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:22,985
Tiny: Oh, God.

459
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:25,085
Lorna: Push.

460
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:27,392
Oh, you got it.
Oh, God.

461
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,762
Lorna: That's good.
Okay.

462
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:31,324
I didn't know they decomposed
so quickly.

463
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:33,427
Ugh. All right.

464
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:35,961
- Clean that up a little bit.
- Okay.

465
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:39,869
Oh, jeez. Hurry up.

466
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:46,071
Lorna: How do I look?

467
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,885
- Blood.
- Oh, God.

468
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,417
Shit.

469
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,565
Good morning, Sheriff Cooley.

470
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:09,503
Good morning, Lorna.

471
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:10,870
What can I do for you?

472
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:13,671
Looks like you're having yourselves
a little event.

473
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:15,700
( Lorna chuckles)
No event, Sheriff.

474
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:17,543
Just a good friend of mine
stopped by

475
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:19,105
to pay a little visit.

476
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:22,118
Oh. Mind if I ask
what's the special occasion?

477
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,450
Two friends don't need
a special occasion

478
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,548
to share a little chat
and some homemade lemonade.

479
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:30,924
Last I checked,
fraternizing ain't against the law.

480
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:35,396
Is there something
I could help you with today, Sheriff?

481
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,457
Yeah, is Dale around?

482
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,526
No. Dale's out.

483
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:41,195
Is that right?

484
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:43,797
I'm pretty sure that's his
station wagon right over here.

485
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,933
Lorna: Well, he didn't drive
his car today.

486
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:48,535
As a matter of fact,
Dale decided

487
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:51,445
to go for a little walk
to clear his mind.

488
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:53,745
A bit hot for a walk, ain't it?

489
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:56,048
You know Dale, Sheriff.

490
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:58,384
He likes to do
as he please.

491
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:01,152
What do you need to see
my dear husband about?

492
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:04,786
Did you perchance hear about
that holdup down in Red County?

493
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:06,489
Mm, the great robbery?

494
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,725
The one.

495
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:10,255
It's all over the news.

496
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:12,564
First thing that came to mind
when I heard about it

497
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,592
was paying Dale here
a visit--

498
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:19,166
you know, with his flagrant
predisposition for thievery.

499
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,677
You're barking up
the wrong tree, Sheriff.

500
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,340
Dale has long abandoned
his criminal ways

501
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:28,317
for the gratifying world
of modular cabinet sales.

502
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:30,148
Yes, so I've heard.

503
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:32,382
And how are things
down at Gale & Sons?

504
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:35,482
Well, business has been
a little slow,

505
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:37,220
as a matter of fact,

506
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:40,320
not a lot of demand
for modular cabinetry of late.

507
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:43,127
About that lemonade-

508
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:45,191
I sure could use a glass.

509
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,635
Not really a good time, Sheriff.

510
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:50,162
We're having a bit
of a girls' day.

511
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:52,801
Don't want to spoil it
by dwelling

512
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:55,437
on Dale's past delinquent
transgressions.

513
00:28:57,035 --> 00:29:00,209
This won't take long. I'll just
have myself a glass of lemonade,

514
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,240
take a little peek around.

515
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:05,186
Lorna: Sheriff Cooley,
if there's nothing I learned

516
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,087
from Dale's past
scrapes with the law,

517
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:10,924
it's that you need yourself
some kind of exigent circumstance

518
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:13,725
to come into my premises
without a warrant.

519
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,096
And as far as I can tell,
I don't see none.

520
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:18,931
Well now, I guess
I'm gonna be hard-pressed

521
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:21,233
to get myself
a search warrant, then.

522
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:24,331
I hear Judge Wallace likes to go
hunting this time of year.

523
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,536
You know Judge Wallace?

524
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:29,340
I spent more time with that man
than my own husband

525
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:32,473
during all them court appearances
a few years back--

526
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:34,848
a hell of a fine man

527
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:37,012
with a real love
for the great outdoors.

528
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:40,716
Mama's third husband goes hunting
with him sometimes in Lamar County.

529
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:42,747
You really got the heart

530
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,159
to cut short
the judge's hunting trip

531
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:46,787
just to get that warrant?

532
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:50,129
Judge Wallace is gonna have to
make do.

533
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:51,930
Well then,

534
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:55,403
I guess you'll visit again
once you get your warrant.

535
00:29:56,394 --> 00:30:00,740
I'm just gonna be waiting here till
I get that search warrant in my hands.

536
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,286
Tiny: Oh.

537
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,497
Lorna: What the hell
is he doing?

538
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:38,770
( Exhales )

539
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:48,385
( exhales )

540
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:51,451
Soon you'll be good and done
with all of this, old fella.

541
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:54,962
Yes, you will.

542
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:02,133
(starts engine)

543
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:15,979
We gotta keep
our head on straight.

544
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:17,714
We don't got much time.

545
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:21,019
Tiny: How long you figure
before they get him that warrant?

546
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,685
Well, I don't know.
A day, a few hours.

547
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,924
What I do know is Dale can't be here
when he comes back.

548
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:29,295
Well, let's just bury him somewhere
and let them bugs get at him.

549
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,926
- Holy Christ, Tiny.
- What?

550
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:33,993
Well, the circumstances
have changed.

551
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:37,097
That was a good plan before,
but it ain't a good plan now.

552
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:40,007
We got a sheriff out there

553
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:41,738
who's watching us
as we speak.

554
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:46,078
What are we supposed to do, just
waltz a dead body right under his nose?

555
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:47,674
You're right.

556
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:50,845
You're right. The situation
has downright thickened.

557
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,819
Let's just make a run for it.

558
00:31:56,814 --> 00:31:59,294
Let's just get in the car,
drive like hell

559
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:01,695
before anybody
finds out anything.

560
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:03,426
Are you out of your
little mind?

561
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:05,764
How long do you think

562
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:08,066
before they catch up with us?

563
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:12,666
It's all fine and dandy if you're up
for one of them high-speed car chases,

564
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:15,940
but I for one am not about
to try to outrun

565
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:19,744
an army of police cars
in your run-down Pacer.

566
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,773
The damn thing needs
a whole new transmission.

567
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:23,547
I've been meaning to take it
to the mechanic and--

568
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:25,281
Oh, for God's sake, Tiny!

569
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:28,154
Now is not the time to be talking about
no automobile maintenance.

570
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:30,420
I was just trying
to be helpful, Lorna.

571
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,155
Well, there's no need
to get hostile.

572
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:35,027
We just need to find ourselves
a sensible solution here.

573
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:37,897
Well, what do you suggest?

574
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,960
Hmm.

575
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:54,815
Say we was able

576
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:57,285
to make Dale disappear

577
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,982
without so much as ever
leaving the house?

578
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,816
When Cooley come back here
with his warrant,

579
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:07,489
he walk around
and he don't find nothing-

580
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:11,360
no Dale, no money-

581
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:13,460
what is he gonna think?

582
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,528
Go on.

583
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,904
He's gonna think

584
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:20,307
that Dale is good and gone...

585
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:25,409
took the money with him,
leaving poor old Lorna behind.

586
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:27,677
A perfectly sensible assumption,
knowing Dale.

587
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:31,346
Cooley'd be out there
chasing a man that don't exist.

588
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:36,022
It's gonna take him
a long while

589
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:38,823
before he
figures anything out,

590
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,352
if he ever do.

591
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:42,126
Meanwhile...

592
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:44,190
Meanwhile, we find that money

593
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:46,759
and as soon as they
look the other way...

594
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:51,433
We run like hell and just buy ourselves
a whole brand-new life.

595
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:53,305
You catch on pretty fast.

596
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:55,106
I like where you're going
with this.

597
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:57,204
- But--
- But?

598
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:02,573
Damn it, Lorna,
how do we make Dale disappear?

599
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:04,450
(sighs)

600
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,217
That there is the pickle.

601
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:23,699
I think I just
figured out a way.

602
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:28,301
- How?
- You ain't gonna like it, Tiny.

603
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:29,936
Try me.

604
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:31,810
Oh, you ain't gonna
like it one bit.

605
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:34,578
Lorna, if you have a way
out of this stickler,

606
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:36,773
I would appreciate
you letting me in on it.

607
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:37,115


608
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:40,656
Well,

609
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:42,487
you know how I fancy myself

610
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:45,687
a pretty efficient housewife
when the need arises?

611
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:48,925
Last Thanksgiving,
Dale's folks was planning

612
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:51,160
to head on over
to Farwell County

613
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:54,602
for that $6.99 buffet special
at the Rose of Texas motel.

614
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:59,802
They get as far as Odessa
when they was hit by a dust storm.

615
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:02,903
The highway patrol
closed all the roads.

616
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:06,677
They said the cows was being
picked clean off the fields

617
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:09,378
and flown up in the air
like little old blackbirds.

618
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:11,614
It was a hell of a storm.

619
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:14,054
So at the last minute

620
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:17,525
they decide they're having
Thanksgiving dinner with us.

621
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:20,825
Some folks have
no manners to speak of.

622
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:22,889
Please, that is Dale's kin for you.

623
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,197
And you know
how his mama can get.

624
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:28,670
That woman-- all she ever do
is criticize me.

625
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:31,435
So...

626
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:35,769
I had just a few hours
to scrub this place clean,

627
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,837
get rid of all the clutter.

628
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:42,011
I mean, it was no fancy Rose of Texas
motel or nothing,

629
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:44,485
but God damn it,
I had the house clean

630
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:46,887
and I had a 70-pound turkey
with all the fixings

631
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:49,858
on that table by 9:00.

632
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:52,452
Now

633
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:57,193
a woman has got a number
of tools at her disposal

634
00:35:57,221 --> 00:36:00,134
to get things
squared away in no time.

635
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:06,741
Take this electric
carving knife, for instance,

636
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:09,711
with an ergonomic handle
for easy maneuvering

637
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:12,977
and a 12-inch
stainless-steel blade

638
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,280
to cut through
the toughest of bones.

639
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:20,183
I can't picture this turkey's bones
being any tougher

640
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:22,487
than a 70-pound bird.

641
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,926
I mean, the man had no spine,
for God's sake.

642
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:31,998
You're not suggesting...

643
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:35,604
That's exactly
what I'm suggesting.

644
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:39,497
You're thinking of
cutting Dale up?

645
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:43,979
Well, I never took
no science class or nothing,

646
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:46,709
but I figure the smaller
the pieces,

647
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:49,013
the easier it will be
to get rid of them.

648
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,045
With a turkey knife?

649
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:57,321
Well, Tiny, if we wasn't
in such a tad of a hurry,

650
00:36:57,348 --> 00:37:00,352
I would like to do things
with a bit more finesse.

651
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:03,263
But we are dealing with
time constraints here.

652
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:09,365
Look,

653
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,771
we'll get Dale

654
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:14,675
good and disappeared
in a jiffy,

655
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:18,909
leaving not a trace of him,

656
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:20,973
like the man never existed.

657
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,754
Are you aware

658
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:32,727
that just a squirt
of rust remover

659
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,094
can eat through
just about anything?

660
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:39,324
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

661
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:42,861
Well, can you think of any other way
to get through this mess? I can't.

662
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:44,770
Well, hell, Lorna,
he's your husband.

663
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:46,502
If you want to cut him up,
that's fine by me.

664
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,840
But I ain't cutting up no man
into little pieces.

665
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:51,677
I suppose the good Lord

666
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:53,807
would want me to take care
of this can of worms myself.

667
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:56,045
I really think He would.

668
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:57,416
On the other hand,

669
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,443
I don't think the good Lord
would mind too much

670
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:03,448
if I asked my best friend to help me out
here, due to the circumstances.

671
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:05,518
For heaven's sake, Lorna,

672
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:08,223
I ain't cutting up no man
into little pieces.

673
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:16,531
The man sure liked
a sharp pair of boots.

674
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:21,004
He knew
how to wear them too.

675
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:30,041
( Knife buzzing )

676
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,220
-( stops buzzing )
- Oh, God.

677
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:39,558
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Tiny, I can't do this.

678
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:42,257
- You what?
- I can't do it. I can't do it, Tiny.

679
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:44,459
I loved the man.

680
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,161
I know he was a son of a bitch
sometimes,

681
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,897
but I swear to God
I loved him.

682
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:50,269
Don't go soft on me now, Lorna.

683
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:54,140
Oh, my God, how could I have gone
and done such a terrible thing?

684
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,145
- He got me roses sometimes.
- Lorna.

685
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,408
He'd bring them.
And he could be so sweet. ( muttering )

686
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:00,643
Lorna, just pull yourself
together now, honey.

687
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,208
- What have I done?
- Just pull yourself together, Lorna.

688
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,516
- Just pull it together.
-( muttering, sobbing )

689
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:08,285
Now is not the time to be reminiscing.
We've got a job to do.

690
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:10,314
Oh, Jesus Christ.
I'm so sorry.

691
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,589
Oh, my God, can
You ever forgive me?

692
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:14,027
( Muttering )

693
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:16,497
Oh, for Pete's sake.

694
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,966
Oh, God.

695
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:21,435
He was so sweet.
( muttering )

696
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:22,767
Oh, God.

697
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:25,569
God damn it, Lorna,
stop that whining!

698
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:27,598
Now if we don't clean this up
in a hurry,

699
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:29,372
we're gonna get into
all sorts of trouble.

700
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,311
He called me
his little yellow rose.

701
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:33,611
And I was his sweet
desert rose.

702
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:35,639
( Lorna muttering )

703
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:38,517
And I loved him the most.
I really did. Oh, God.

704
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,180
Just give me that knife.

705
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,555
Lorna: He was so nice to me
when he wasn't being a shit.

706
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,617
Oh, my God.

707
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:46,650
Hell of a good time
we're having, huh?

708
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:49,187
Lorna: Dale, can you ever
forgive me? Please forgive me.

709
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,564
-( Knife buzzing )
- Oh, God.

710
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:01,400
Well, butter my ass
and call me a biscuit.

711
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:05,005
Where did you learn how to work
an electronical device like that?

712
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:07,481
Shop class.

713
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:10,145
- Shop class?
- Yeah.

714
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:12,211
Remember last July

715
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,655
when I was laid off
from work?

716
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:18,057
I had nothing to do
but sit in front of a busted fan

717
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,289
and drink Wild Turkey all day.

718
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:21,819
( Stops buzzing )

719
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:24,093
I went and took shop class.

720
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:25,532
( Buzzing )

721
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:28,730
What on earth did you go
and take a shop class for?

722
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:35,669
I guess I always kind of liked
cutting stuff up.

723
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:38,009
Apparently so.

724
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:44,275
(saw buzzing )

725
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:46,117

(sighs)

729
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:40,803
Now what?

730
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:44,108
The Crown blender,
model 15D,

731
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:46,842
will easily grind ice
without burnout

732
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:48,782
using a revolutionary

733
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:52,185
regular interval
pulsation technique.

734
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,451
That's right.

735
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:00,818
Would you look at that?

736
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,022
Huh.

737
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:08,202
Is it supposed to be
moving around like that?

738
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:11,467
- Oh.
- Oh, Lord.

739
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:13,031
Oh, Lord.

740
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:14,542

Hey. Ah.

Ah, don't try
to be too smart.

854
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:41,328

Man, my papa always told me

857
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:51,468
the good Lord never meant
for women

858
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:53,742
to have idle time
on their hands-

859
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:55,750

but trouble.

860
00:52:55,772 --> 00:53:00,619

your fair share here.

00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:24,610
Yeah, I know, for instance,
your name is Tillie Belle,

872
00:53:24,634 --> 00:53:28,343
but they call you Tiny on account
you so goddamn skinny.

873
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,851
Yeah, you like to smoke
light cigarettes.

874
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:34,686
You like your Jack Daniels
with a Coke back.

875
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:36,782
You work Mondays, Tuesdays
and Wednesdays

876
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:39,054
at the Blue Iguana Bar
on Main Street.

877
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:43,053
Past few weeks, you've been
behind the bar on Saturdays too,

878
00:53:43,086 --> 00:53:45,623
till about midnight, I believe.

879
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:47,828
Yeah, am I forgetting something?

880
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:49,495
Oh, yeah.

881
00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:51,665
You like to paint your toenails
flame red.

882
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:53,606
( Chuckles )
Very nice.

883
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:55,007
How do you know
all that?

884
00:53:55,031 --> 00:53:58,535
Mm, how I know it
is not as important

885
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:01,845
as why I know it.
Ain't that right, Lorna?

886
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:03,851
What in Sam Hill
is he talking about?

887
00:54:03,873 --> 00:54:06,012
Oh.

888
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:10,013
Oh, you two gals got a lot
of catching up to do.

889
00:54:10,046 --> 00:54:11,992
And you're gonna have
all the time in the world

890
00:54:12,015 --> 00:54:13,688
once I'm
out of your hair, okay?

891
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:16,391
That is, of course,
after I get what I come for.

892
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:18,262
And what would that be?

893
00:54:18,288 --> 00:54:21,326
Oh, Lorna,
you disappoint me.

894
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:23,235
I thought you hired me

895
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,570
because you heard
of my reputation.

896
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:29,133
I mean, you know I am
pretty darn good at what I do,

897
00:54:29,165 --> 00:54:31,577
like finding out things.

898
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:35,174
I mean, that's why folks
call on Maurice Doucette,

899
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:37,207
P.I.

900
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:43,288
But I must admit I'm surprised
how things turned out here.

901
00:54:43,313 --> 00:54:45,520
God damn.

902
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:49,052
I mean, knowing what I know, I expected
a whole different state of affairs.

903
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:50,996
See, I thought maybe
one of you

904
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:53,001
or, hell, even both of you
would be dead,

905
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:55,594
and Dale would be on his merry way
out to Mexico.

906
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:59,095
Instead there's poor old Dale.

907
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:01,370
He's deader than
Chief Billy Bowlegs

908
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:03,400
out of the Third Seminole War,

909
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:06,414
while you two gals are just
having the time of your lives.

910
00:55:06,436 --> 00:55:08,245
( laughs)

911
00:55:08,271 --> 00:55:11,514
Damn, I never could
understand women.

912
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:14,784
Why is he saying
that you hired him?

913
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:16,154
'Cause I did.

914
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:17,954
That's right.
She did.

915
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:22,123
She hired the darn best
private investigator in the country.

916
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,631
Ain't that right?

917
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:26,099
Why would you hire
a private investigator?

918
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:29,467
To catch that son of a bitch Dale
cheating on me.

919
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:31,768
Yeah, and I did too.

920
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:36,104
I caught the fornicating husband
right in the act.

921
00:55:36,132 --> 00:55:38,578
I mean, like I said,
I am the best.

922
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:40,478
I always knew
he was a cheating dog.

923
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:43,074
I guess I just needed
an official confirmation.

924
00:55:43,106 --> 00:55:44,915
Well, I'm glad
I could be of service.

925
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:47,478
Well, you was.
Now you can leave.

926
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:50,889
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
My job here is not quite done.

927
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:52,951
No.

928
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:56,191
You really think I was gonna let
this little robbery business slide

929
00:55:56,219 --> 00:55:59,598
and just collect my $200 fee
and disappear? Huh?

930
00:55:59,622 --> 00:56:01,363
What are you talking about?

931
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:04,133
Oh, I'm talking
about dear old Dale

932
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:08,802
making away with $100,000
of Red County money.

933
00:56:08,832 --> 00:56:10,140
Shoot.

934
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:12,168
That's a lot of dough.

935
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:14,546
I like dough.

936
00:56:14,571 --> 00:56:18,519
It buys me nice clothes.
I like nice clothes.

937
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,384
Well, that's just dandy.

938
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:22,788
What, did he go and rob that bank
right under your nose?

939
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:25,088
No. Not quite, no.

940
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:28,562
No, I didn't add it all up
until I saw the paper this morning.

941
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:31,395
Then it all made
a whole lot of sense.

942
00:56:31,421 --> 00:56:33,594
- What did?
- Hell, when you spend all your time

943
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:35,625
following a man around
day in and day out,

944
00:56:35,658 --> 00:56:38,104
you get to know a few things
about the fella.

945
00:56:39,496 --> 00:56:41,533
And after I read
about the robbery,

946
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:44,636
I put all the pieces together.

947
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:47,614
Yeah, Dale served two years

948
00:56:47,637 --> 00:56:50,015
at Lovelady State
for armed robbery.

949
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:53,145
The man used
a Smith & Wesson Model 29

950
00:56:53,176 --> 00:56:55,656
with custom-made
Rio Rosewood grip

951
00:56:55,678 --> 00:56:57,453
for all the holdups.

952
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:01,257
That's the same gun
described in the paper.

953
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:04,390
And that's the same one
right here.

954
00:57:06,055 --> 00:57:08,399
And then
there are the boots.

955
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,701
- Boots?
- Oh, yeah, that's right.

956
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:13,731
See, I'm a fine
boot connoisseur myself.

957
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:18,735
I can appreciate a fine specimen
of custom-made footwear when I see it.

958
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:22,477
And the first time I laid eyes
on Dale's boots

959
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:25,111
I knew I'd never seen
a pair like that before.

960
00:57:25,141 --> 00:57:27,212
What do Dale's boots
gotta do with the robbery?

961
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:31,316
Ah, well, allow me
to elucidate.

962
00:57:33,416 --> 00:57:36,090
Now I visited

963
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:39,692
the Waldorf Savings & Loan
after I read about the deed.

964
00:57:39,722 --> 00:57:42,498
Yeah, and I made nice
with the teller.

965
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:43,731
He's an old-timer.

966
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,832
He's as proud as a parade
to be a part of the great robbery.

967
00:57:46,863 --> 00:57:51,278
And he says to me
that he was just standing at his window

968
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,804
when this highwayman
just waltzed right up to him

969
00:57:53,837 --> 00:57:55,839
and demanded the money.

970
00:57:55,872 --> 00:58:00,218
He says the man acted
like he owned the world

971
00:58:00,243 --> 00:58:03,247
and, hell, wearing a pair of boots
like he was wearing,

972
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:05,418
he might as well have.

973
00:58:05,448 --> 00:58:07,359
So I asked him,

974
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:09,886
"What about the boots?"

975
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:12,058
And he tells me
the man was wearing

976
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:15,535
the nicest footwear
he's seen this side of Abilene--

977
00:58:15,558 --> 00:58:17,003
a great pair.

978
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:20,439
A full-quill ostrich vamp

979
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:25,310
with a smooth,
hand-stitched bovine leg.

980
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:26,712
(chuckling )

981
00:58:26,736 --> 00:58:28,909
One-of-a-kind footwear

982
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:32,078
and a Rio Rosewood grip
revolver.

983
00:58:32,108 --> 00:58:34,315
Now it's not every day

984
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:37,723
you see a man commit armed robbery
sporting his favorite duds.

985
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:39,590
God damn it, Dale.

986
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:43,223
That is, of course,
unless he was busy with less--

987
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:45,699
now how shall I say this?

988
00:58:45,722 --> 00:58:48,430
--Savory activities.

989
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:50,529
Ain't that right, Tiny?

990
00:58:53,596 --> 00:58:55,075
I don't know
what you're talking about.

991
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:57,271
You don't need to keep
playing dumb, Tiny.

992
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:58,938
I know you was
screwing Dale.

993
00:58:58,968 --> 00:59:00,470
( Gasps )

994
00:59:00,503 --> 00:59:02,608
He didn't surprise me.
But you--

995
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:04,448
I didn't know
you'd stoop that low.

996
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:06,579
We've been friends for a lifetime.
Shame on you.

997
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:09,556
I swear, Lorna,
I didn't so much as touch the man.

998
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:12,219
Oh, you did a lot more
than touch him.

999
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:15,161
Oh, yeah, after your shift
at the Blue Iguana,

1000
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:16,993
you two was fornicating
like bunnies.

1001
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,795
Go on, tell her
what you done.

1002
00:59:18,821 --> 00:59:20,926
She ain't lying.

1003
00:59:20,957 --> 00:59:22,231
No.

1004
00:59:22,258 --> 00:59:25,262
See, I got some pretty
revealing photographs

1005
00:59:25,295 --> 00:59:27,741
of you two lovebirds
getting intimately acquainted

1006
00:59:27,764 --> 00:59:29,766
in the backseat
of Dale's car

1007
00:59:29,799 --> 00:59:33,576
parked right out
behind the Blue Iguana-

1008
00:59:33,603 --> 00:59:35,480
hell of a classy spectacle.

1009
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:39,112
How did you--?

1010
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:41,884
What, how did I suspect?

1011
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:44,755
Dale never smoked nothing
but them stinky cigarettes

1012
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:46,624
that smelled like hell.

1013
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:50,688
And guess what I found
in the ashtray of his car?

1014
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,257
What?

1015
00:59:53,289 --> 00:59:55,565
Light cigarettes.

1016
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:57,128
Shit.

1017
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,299
Dale never smoked them
light cigarettes in his life.

1018
00:59:59,329 --> 01:00:02,310
- Lots of folks smoke lights.
- Oh, yeah?

1019
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:05,142
And how many of them

1020
01:00:05,168 --> 01:00:08,547
work at the Blue Iguana?

1021
01:00:08,571 --> 01:00:10,175
( laughing )

1022
01:00:11,174 --> 01:00:13,677
You left clues
all over Dale's car.

1023
01:00:15,812 --> 01:00:18,224
Oh, but then I found me

1024
01:00:18,247 --> 01:00:20,659
one hell of an incriminating
evidence.

1025
01:00:20,683 --> 01:00:23,789
Ooh, this here is the real doozy.

1026
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:27,495
- A flirting flip hair clip.
- Oh.

1027
01:00:27,523 --> 01:00:29,764
It comes free with that
odious hair spray you use-

1028
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:32,102
what was it? Colossal spray.
How does that ditty go?

1029
01:00:35,565 --> 01:00:38,136
♪ Colossal hair spray ♪

1030
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:41,376
♪ More hold, less fray. ♪

1031
01:00:41,404 --> 01:00:44,851
It must have come off atone of them
passionate rendezvous of yours.

1032
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:48,683
What, did you think
I wasn't gonna find out?

1033
01:00:48,711 --> 01:00:50,748
I seen the way
he'd look at you.

1034
01:00:53,282 --> 01:00:55,023
Oh.

1035
01:00:55,051 --> 01:00:58,430
Hell, Lorna,

1036
01:00:58,454 --> 01:01:00,434
I don't know
how it happened.

1037
01:01:00,456 --> 01:01:02,800
Oh, you don't know how
it happened?

1038
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:05,135
Well, I'll tell you
how it happened.

1039
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:08,506
You couldn't just go and beguile
any man on this earth.

1040
01:01:08,531 --> 01:01:10,033
It had to be mine.

1041
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:14,307
Dale wasn't much to look at,
but he was my husband.

1042
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:16,817
I thought we was best friends.

1043
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:18,113
We are.
That don't change.

1044
01:01:18,141 --> 01:01:20,519
Like hell it don't.

1045
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:25,289
What about the money?

1046
01:01:25,314 --> 01:01:27,954
What about what you said
about us finding that money

1047
01:01:27,984 --> 01:01:29,622
and then splitting it?
Was you lying?

1048
01:01:29,652 --> 01:01:32,064
- Was you?
- All right, enough.

1049
01:01:32,088 --> 01:01:34,227
Now you'll have all the time
in the world to have it out

1050
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:37,602
once I'm good and gone,
but let's get at what I'm here for.

1051
01:01:39,729 --> 01:01:39,828
The money, God damn it.
Where's the money?

1052
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:42,139
The money, God damn it.
Where's the money?

1053
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:44,611
- See what you did?
- What I did?

1054
01:01:44,634 --> 01:01:47,274
If you'd have trusted me,
we wouldn't be in this predicament.

1055
01:01:47,303 --> 01:01:48,907
Oh, trusted you?

1056
01:01:48,938 --> 01:01:50,508
I mean, you could have
just asked me about it.

1057
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:51,985
Ask you about
screwing my husband?

1058
01:01:52,008 --> 01:01:54,784
Well, we sure wouldn't be in this mess
that we are right now.

1059
01:01:54,811 --> 01:01:57,451
Lorna: How was I supposed to know
that he was gonna up and rob a bank

1060
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,153
in the middle
of this investigation?

1061
01:01:59,182 --> 01:02:01,628
Well, he's your husband. Aren't wives
supposed to know these things?

1062
01:02:01,651 --> 01:02:03,562
Will you two just
shut the hell up?

1063
01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:07,329
God, I've had it up to here
with your female chatter.

1064
01:02:07,356 --> 01:02:09,700
It's enough to drive
a perfectly sane man fruity.

1065
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:10,966
Do you mind?

1066
01:02:10,993 --> 01:02:13,667
We are trying to have
a meaningful conversation here.

1067
01:02:13,696 --> 01:02:16,267
Well, you're gonna have that
meaningful conversation in hell

1068
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:18,245
if you don't tell me
where that money is.

1069
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:22,707
Do you think I'm stupid?

1070
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:25,345
What are you talking about?

1071
01:02:25,374 --> 01:02:28,651
There's a sheriff's car
parked right outside there.

1072
01:02:28,678 --> 01:02:32,717
You so much as breathe funny,
and Sheriff Cooley will be at that door

1073
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,729
faster than a fly
on horseshit.

1074
01:02:47,363 --> 01:02:50,674
Well, no need to get hostile.

1075
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:53,146
We don't know where the money is.
Tell him, Lorna.

1076
01:02:53,169 --> 01:02:55,479
- She's telling the truth for once.
- We have turned this place

1077
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:57,576
inside and out.
We haven't found a damn thing.

1078
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,348
Lorna: I could have sworn
Dale hid the money in here.

1079
01:02:59,375 --> 01:03:01,184
She said she knew him
like the back of her hand.

1080
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:02,883
I guess the wife's always
the last to know.

1081
01:03:02,912 --> 01:03:04,823
I don't believe you
for a minute.

1082
01:03:04,847 --> 01:03:06,349
Why would we be lying?

1083
01:03:06,382 --> 01:03:08,726
Because you're women.
It comes natural.

1084
01:03:08,751 --> 01:03:12,096
Now one of you two damn squaws
knows more than you're letting on.

1085
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:13,862
I just haven't figured out
which one it is yet.

1086
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:15,426
What are you
going on about?

1087
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,870
God damn it!
Drop the dumb act.

1088
01:03:17,894 --> 01:03:20,397
I know how it played out.

1089
01:03:20,429 --> 01:03:22,636
Now I know for a fact
that Dale

1090
01:03:22,665 --> 01:03:26,203
jumped into the passenger seat
of that getaway car when he evaded.

1091
01:03:26,235 --> 01:03:29,444
Huh? Yeah, that's right-
the passenger seat.

1092
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,474
The bank teller swore to it.

1093
01:03:31,507 --> 01:03:35,148
And last time I checked, we wasn't one
of them British Commonwealth countries.

1094
01:03:35,178 --> 01:03:38,387
No, sir, we do our driving
on the left out here,

1095
01:03:38,414 --> 01:03:40,416
the way God intended.

1096
01:03:40,449 --> 01:03:43,828
So that means that somebody else
was driving that car

1097
01:03:43,853 --> 01:03:45,799
when the thieving went down.

1098
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:50,202
And I figure one of you two beauties
is a coconspirator.

1099
01:03:55,398 --> 01:03:57,901
You was in on this
since the beginning.

1100
01:03:57,934 --> 01:04:01,040
All right, but all I did
was drive the car.

1101
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:04,381
I mean, I borrowed Rose's Corvair
so the law wouldn't be on our tracks.

1102
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:05,909
I can't believe my ears.

1103
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:08,786
Well, Dale said he'd make it
worth my while if I just helped him out.

1104
01:04:08,811 --> 01:04:10,848
Instead he was just planning
to make a run for it

1105
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,723
without saying
so much as a goodbye.

1106
01:04:12,748 --> 01:04:15,285
( Lorna laughing )

1107
01:04:19,422 --> 01:04:20,958
What is so goddamn funny?

1108
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:23,766
He went and double-crossed
you too.

1109
01:04:23,793 --> 01:04:25,739
That's what you get

1110
01:04:25,761 --> 01:04:28,503
for leaving an adulterous dog
in charge of the money.

1111
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:31,068
He just went
and promised me the moon.

1112
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:32,773
Oh, and you believed him?

1113
01:04:32,802 --> 01:04:36,375
He was two-timing his own wife.
My God, you're dumber than I thought.

1114
01:04:36,405 --> 01:04:39,875
Shut up. Shut up.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

1115
01:04:39,909 --> 01:04:42,321
Shut up! Shut up!

1116
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:45,290
Shut up!

1117
01:04:45,314 --> 01:04:46,816
Lookie here,

1118
01:04:46,849 --> 01:04:49,728
you folks are really interesting
company, all right?

1119
01:04:49,752 --> 01:04:51,959
And I would just love to stay
and hear more

1120
01:04:51,988 --> 01:04:54,400
about the joys
of holy matrimony

1121
01:04:54,423 --> 01:04:56,528
and the rewards
of true friendship,

1122
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:59,472
but I'm in a tad
of a scramble.

1123
01:04:59,495 --> 01:05:00,997
I want the money!

1124
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:02,873
I don't give a hoot
what you have to do,

1125
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,402
but you produce the cash
or I will shoot you both dead

1126
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:08,472
right here, right now,
swear to God.

1127
01:05:08,504 --> 01:05:10,506
- Wait a second.
- What?

1128
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:12,519
I just thought of a place
we ain't looked.

1129
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:14,316
Together: Where?

1130
01:05:14,343 --> 01:05:17,847
Well, it's a bit of a tight fit.

1131
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:20,622
I don't think he could stash
nothing down there.

1132
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:23,096
Well, no, I bet-- I wouldn't be
surprised if he put it there.

1133
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:25,395
In fact, nothing about this
whole goddamn affair

1134
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:27,298
could possibly
surprise me anymore.

1135
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:29,667
Go ahead, lead the way.

1136
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:32,172
(grunting )

1137
01:05:43,406 --> 01:05:45,408
Where does it go?

1138
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:47,318
Outside.

1139
01:05:47,343 --> 01:05:51,291
I can hear the rats scampering
between the walls at night.

1140
01:05:52,715 --> 01:05:55,195
Give us a screwdriver,
will you?

1141
01:06:03,326 --> 01:06:05,602
Nah, I'll do the honors.

1142
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:08,666
Now you're liable to have
a gun stashed in there.

1143
01:06:10,399 --> 01:06:13,243
( Chuckles )
Aren't you the clever one?

1144
01:06:14,337 --> 01:06:16,840
My daddy always said
trusting women is like

1145
01:06:16,872 --> 01:06:19,250
petting a rattler
and hoping he don't bite.

1146
01:06:34,223 --> 01:06:36,294
-( Slams)
-( screams)

1147
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:37,963
Goddamn mousetrap!

1148
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:39,735
(screams)

1149
01:06:49,305 --> 01:06:50,807
God damn it.

1150
01:07:00,649 --> 01:07:02,287
Oh, God.

1151
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:05,162
Oh, God. God.

1152
01:07:07,890 --> 01:07:10,734
God damn you.

1153
01:07:14,163 --> 01:07:16,439
My daddy warned me.

1154
01:07:26,308 --> 01:07:28,652
( Exhales )

1155
01:07:29,912 --> 01:07:31,482
( exhales )

1156
01:07:31,514 --> 01:07:33,858
Figure it was self-defense?

1157
01:07:35,084 --> 01:07:36,791
Absolutely.

1158
01:07:38,754 --> 01:07:40,529
I concur.

1159
01:07:43,592 --> 01:07:45,594
I'll drink to that.

1160
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:03,815
(sighs)

1161
01:08:03,846 --> 01:08:05,086
Here you go.

1162
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:16,302
(exclaims)

1163
01:08:16,325 --> 01:08:18,771
Oh, son of a bitch!
Damn it.

1164
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:21,870
You know what I think?

1165
01:08:21,897 --> 01:08:23,240
What?

1166
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:26,576
You had no intention

1167
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:29,913
of splitting nothing
with me 50/50.

1168
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:35,585
That's what I think.

1169
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:39,024
You knew I was screwing Dale
behind your back,

1170
01:08:39,048 --> 01:08:41,961
and if I know anything
about you, Lorna,

1171
01:08:41,984 --> 01:08:44,726
you ain't exactly
the forgiving type.

1172
01:08:44,753 --> 01:08:48,064
I think you was gonna take
all that money

1173
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:50,092
and just run.

1174
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:52,197
And you know
what else I think?

1175
01:08:52,228 --> 01:08:56,005
I think you know
where the money is.

1176
01:08:57,399 --> 01:08:59,140
You're right.

1177
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:01,239
I do know
where that money is.

1178
01:09:02,404 --> 01:09:03,576
You do?

1179
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:05,608
( Chuckles )
Sure.

1180
01:09:06,842 --> 01:09:09,152
Why don't you just
lower them guns?

1181
01:09:09,178 --> 01:09:11,283
And we'll have
a good talk about it.

1182
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:12,917
You think I'm stupid?

1183
01:09:12,948 --> 01:09:15,519
(chuckles)
Well, Tiny,

1184
01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:18,293
intellectual fancy

1185
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:19,765
has never really been
your oyster.

1186
01:09:19,788 --> 01:09:22,029
Well, then please

1187
01:09:22,057 --> 01:09:24,833
impress me
with your acumen.

1188
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:27,739
Where is the money?!

1189
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:31,777
Easy-peasy.

1190
01:09:32,768 --> 01:09:35,112
Did you happen to notice

1191
01:09:35,137 --> 01:09:37,515
anything peculiar

1192
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:42,046
about my dear old husband's
fingernails this morning?

1193
01:09:42,077 --> 01:09:46,116
Can't say I ever paid Dale's fingernails
no never mind. Why?

1194
01:09:46,148 --> 01:09:48,594
Well, if you had,

1195
01:09:48,617 --> 01:09:51,461
you would have realized there was
all sorts of dirt under them.

1196
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:52,795
Dirt?

1197
01:09:52,821 --> 01:09:55,495
Did you ever notice
my daisies outside?

1198
01:09:57,493 --> 01:09:58,836
Yeah. What about them?

1199
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:00,807
Do you think
it's easy to grow

1200
01:10:00,829 --> 01:10:03,435
prizewinning daisies
in this vicious heat?

1201
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:06,202
I don't know.

1202
01:10:06,235 --> 01:10:08,841
(chuckles)
Well, let me tell you,

1203
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:10,908
you need a green thumb

1204
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:14,319
and a perfect combination
of potting soil

1205
01:10:14,343 --> 01:10:16,482
to grow those flowers
out there.

1206
01:10:16,512 --> 01:10:19,356
It ain't no coincidence
I was Miss Flower Fingers

1207
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:21,793
of Clark County
two years in a row.

1208
01:10:21,817 --> 01:10:24,024
Too much manure

1209
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:26,693
and you got
disease specimens

1210
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:29,464
growing all kinds of lint.

1211
01:10:29,491 --> 01:10:33,371
You ever see a lazy daisy leaf

1212
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:35,272
defaced by honey fungus?

1213
01:10:35,297 --> 01:10:38,210
I can't say I ever have.

1214
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:42,216
Tiny, I hope you never do.

1215
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:45,817
It is a sight
you won't easily forget.

1216
01:10:45,841 --> 01:10:48,048
God damn it, Lorna!

1217
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:51,024
We ain't talking about
just dirt here.

1218
01:10:53,115 --> 01:10:54,788
We are talking

1219
01:10:54,817 --> 01:10:57,354
equal parts humus
and manure

1220
01:10:57,386 --> 01:10:59,798
and a whole hell of a lot
of charcoal.

1221
01:10:59,822 --> 01:11:02,826
It's as black
as a burned-out spark plug

1222
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:04,860
and it smells like hell.

1223
01:11:04,893 --> 01:11:09,308
I'd recognize my special blend
of soil anywhere.

1224
01:11:09,331 --> 01:11:12,540
And Dale's fingernails
was covered in it.

1225
01:11:12,568 --> 01:11:13,911
( Gasps )

1226
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:17,509
That's right.

1227
01:11:17,539 --> 01:11:20,577
That money is just
sitting out there

1228
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:23,021
underneath my lazy daisies.

1229
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:30,863
You knew where the money was
the whole time?

1230
01:11:32,354 --> 01:11:34,300
Sure.

1231
01:11:34,323 --> 01:11:36,496
As soon as I figured it out,

1232
01:11:36,525 --> 01:11:40,598
I didn't need Dale alive anymore,
so I put a bullet in his head.

1233
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:42,199
You what?

1234
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:46,902
You heard me.

1235
01:11:47,903 --> 01:11:50,076
I shot the son of a bitch
like a dog.

1236
01:11:50,105 --> 01:11:52,449
It weren't no accident.

1237
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:56,690
I wanted him dead
as soon as I heard about you two.

1238
01:11:56,712 --> 01:11:59,386
You murdered Dale?

1239
01:12:00,683 --> 01:12:02,924
O" P'-"pose?

1240
01:12:02,951 --> 01:12:04,555
Well, hell,

1241
01:12:04,586 --> 01:12:07,066
even a good woman's got
a breaking point.

1242
01:12:09,358 --> 01:12:11,634
To tell the truth,

1243
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:14,903
I wanted to put a bullet
through your stupid little brain

1244
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:17,308
the second you walked
through that door.

1245
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:20,746
But that would have spoiled
all the fun.

1246
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:23,113
Fun?

1247
01:12:23,138 --> 01:12:25,049
What fun?

1248
01:12:26,041 --> 01:12:30,080
To watch you cut your bastard lover
up with a turkey knife.

1249
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:33,821
What?

1250
01:12:36,318 --> 01:12:38,594
You crazy bitch!

1251
01:12:39,588 --> 01:12:40,965
Oh.

1252
01:12:40,989 --> 01:12:44,766
Oh, I should have known
you was after something.

1253
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:47,103
Dale always said
you was like a kettle

1254
01:12:47,129 --> 01:12:50,167
that's just been on the stove
for too long.

1255
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:54,170
Sooner or later
you was gonna blow up.

1256
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:56,843
Well,

1257
01:12:56,872 --> 01:12:59,751
that bullet should have come to him
as no surprise, then.

1258
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:05,590
Oh, for Pete's sake,
would you look at this?

1259
01:13:05,614 --> 01:13:08,925
God damn it, Dale-
on my favorite rug.

1260
01:13:08,951 --> 01:13:10,953
All that man ever do
is create a mess.

1261
01:13:10,986 --> 01:13:11,987
(clicks tongue)

1262
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:17,297
God damn it, Lorna!

1263
01:13:17,326 --> 01:13:20,569
The law is right outside
that door.

1264
01:13:20,596 --> 01:13:24,669
We have got Dale parts
all over this place

1265
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:27,647
and I'm pointing
two revolvers at you.

1266
01:13:27,669 --> 01:13:30,377
( laughing )

1267
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:33,683
How do you think you're gonna
get out of this one, huh?

1268
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:37,122
Well, I just thought
of something

1269
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:39,752
just a little moment ago.

1270
01:13:41,216 --> 01:13:44,686
I haven't worked out
the details or nothing,

1271
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:47,428
but I think
it's gonna have to do.

1272
01:13:47,456 --> 01:13:49,561
Well, for Pete's sake,

1273
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:51,366
what?

1274
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:56,437
Oh.

1275
01:14:02,404 --> 01:14:04,077
Hmm.

1276
01:14:14,349 --> 01:14:16,351
(sighs)

1277
01:14:16,385 --> 01:14:18,592
No hard feelings, Tiny.

1278
01:14:19,888 --> 01:14:22,994
It's just the way
the world works sometimes.

1279
01:14:23,025 --> 01:14:25,631
Some folks lose

1280
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:28,471

- What the hell happened in here?

Looks like the handiwork
of the devil himself.

1359
01:21:07,262 --> 01:21:09,503
I've been witness to a bloody
occurrence or two

1360
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:11,533
in my time
as Clark County Sheriff.

1361
01:21:11,566 --> 01:21:15,776
Ed Crawford four years ago
killed his wife with a hammer,

1362
01:21:15,804 --> 01:21:19,843
ripped her eyes out,
threw them in the garbage disposal,

1363
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:22,719
said she was
looking at him funny.

1364
01:21:22,744 --> 01:21:24,815
It was a bloody mess.

1365
01:21:24,846 --> 01:21:26,450
But this--

1366
01:21:26,481 --> 01:21:29,485
I ain't never seen nothing like this
as long as I lived.

1367
01:21:30,518 --> 01:21:32,828
I'm glad I put in
for an early retirement.

1368
01:21:32,854 --> 01:21:36,495
A man's got to know
when to throw in the towel.

1369
01:21:36,524 --> 01:21:38,629

do you reckon dead, Sheriff?

1370

1372
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,877

1375
01:21:51,506 --> 01:21:53,577

She's done all the killing?

1380
01:22:06,521 --> 01:22:10,526
I don't assume we'll ever know
what the hell went on here,

1381
01:22:10,558 --> 01:22:13,198
but she was definitely
the last one standing.

1382
01:22:13,228 --> 01:22:16,266
It's hard to believe.
She's so dainty-looking.

1383
01:22:16,298 --> 01:22:19,177
Money is one hell
of a motivator, Deputy.

1384
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:20,702
Where do you figure
the money went?

1385
01:22:20,735 --> 01:22:23,716
The $100,000 from the robbery
has got to be somewhere.

1386
01:22:23,738 --> 01:22:25,740
Yeah, it's blood money.

1387
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:28,914
Better it stays where it is and don't
cause no more problems to nobody.

1388
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:31,220
Deputy #2: Well, any chance
the money's in here somewhere?

1389
01:22:31,246 --> 01:22:32,884
-( Deputy #1 moaning )
- Looks to me that somebody

1390
01:22:32,914 --> 01:22:35,360
already went looking.
This place is all tore up.

1391
01:22:35,383 --> 01:22:38,057
Ugh.

1392
01:22:38,086 --> 01:22:39,997
I got a finger here, Sheriff.

1393
01:22:48,697 --> 01:22:50,802
"To Lorna.

1394
01:22:50,832 --> 01:22:53,210
Love, Dale."

1395
01:22:53,234 --> 01:22:54,838
You reckon that's the wife's?

1396
01:22:54,869 --> 01:22:56,746
Well, that's Lorna, all right.

1397
01:22:56,771 --> 01:22:58,773
What's left of her.

1398
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:02,687
Boy, what a way to go, huh?

1399
01:23:02,711 --> 01:23:04,952
Well,

1400
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:07,620
may God keep her
in His magnificent grace.

1401
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:09,651
Amen.

1402
01:23:20,061 --> 01:23:21,563
( Exhales )

1403
01:23:21,596 --> 01:23:23,405
Deputy: Well, there's gotta be
people that do this.

1404
01:23:23,431 --> 01:23:25,707
Deputy #2: Yeah, yeah, well, it's not
us, believe me. I've just had it.

1405
01:23:25,734 --> 01:23:27,270
Who's gonna give them
a proper burial?

1406
01:23:27,302 --> 01:23:28,975
I don't give a damn!

1407
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:31,280
Good God, let somebody else
clean it up.

1408
01:23:31,306 --> 01:23:34,219
-( Deputies continue chattering )
- Poor devils.

1409
01:23:34,242 --> 01:23:36,688
Wouldn't want to be
in their boots.

1410
01:23:36,711 --> 01:23:40,056
That's one hell of a mess
they got left to sort out.

1411
01:23:41,082 --> 01:23:43,460
That's one hell of a mess.

1412
01:23:43,485 --> 01:23:44,987
- Deputy: Oh, my Lord.
- Deputy #2: Yeah.

1413
01:24:35,136 --> 01:24:38,777
( Sighs ) If ever there was
the right time to bow out...

1414
01:24:41,843 --> 01:24:44,551
( door opens and closes )

1415
01:24:44,579 --> 01:24:46,991
How are you doing there, Sheriff?

1416
01:24:47,015 --> 01:24:49,495
You ever think
you'd see me again?

1417
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:53,726
We could have sworn
you was dead, Lorna.

1418
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:57,328
Well, I'm glad to hear that I have
you folks thinking the worst.

1419
01:24:57,358 --> 01:25:01,067
I suggest you get that gun
away from my head.

1420
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:04,373
Why don't you
make me, Sheriff?

1421
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:05,901
I know better

1422
01:25:05,934 --> 01:25:08,778
than to ruffle a woman
with a weapon in her hand.

1423
01:25:08,803 --> 01:25:11,977
Well, that's one thing
you learned

1424
01:25:12,006 --> 01:25:14,680
that Dale never did.

1425
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:17,621
Yeah!

1426
01:25:20,715 --> 01:25:24,663
( laughing )

1427
01:25:24,686 --> 01:25:26,859
I've got something
to show you.

1428
01:25:30,024 --> 01:25:32,334
How do you like my do?

1429
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:35,534
A real looker.

1430
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:38,501
How did you like
the little surprise

1431
01:25:38,533 --> 01:25:40,843
I left for the Clark County
Sheriff's Department?

1432
01:25:40,869 --> 01:25:43,213
You gave them poor devils
something to puzzle over.

1433
01:25:43,238 --> 01:25:45,184
I wanted to make it look like

1434
01:25:45,206 --> 01:25:48,380
the worst bloodbath
in the history of Clark County.

1435
01:25:48,409 --> 01:25:51,720
Nobody's ever gonna be able
to tell what happened in there.

1436
01:25:51,746 --> 01:25:54,693
But the law will be talking
about it for a very long time.

1437
01:25:54,716 --> 01:25:56,718
You got that right.

1438
01:25:56,751 --> 01:25:59,197
Ooh, and they'll all be
wondering

1439
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:02,861
how such a sweet little thing
like Tiny

1440
01:26:02,891 --> 01:26:05,667
could have gone and done
such a devilish thing,

1441
01:26:05,693 --> 01:26:08,867
how she could have killed
two grown men,

1442
01:26:08,897 --> 01:26:10,899
her best friend,

1443
01:26:10,932 --> 01:26:13,378
minced her up
into little pieces,

1444
01:26:13,401 --> 01:26:16,814
leaving nothing behind
but her ring finger.

1445
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:19,751
And all the folks
are gonna wonder

1446
01:26:19,774 --> 01:26:22,448
what happened
to poor Lorna's body.

1447
01:26:22,477 --> 01:26:25,458
Yeah, the West Texas desert

1448
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:27,426
is an awfully big place

1449
01:26:27,448 --> 01:26:29,860
with a lot of hungry
critters in it.

1450
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:34,632
No telling
what became of her.

1451
01:26:34,656 --> 01:26:37,933
I sure am glad I wasn't
the one to cross you,

1452
01:26:37,959 --> 01:26:41,133
'cause you have one hell
of a mean disposition

1453
01:26:41,162 --> 01:26:43,164
when you put
your mind to it, woman.

1454
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:45,200
I have been known
to hold a grudge.

1455
01:26:47,602 --> 01:26:49,377
Here you go, baby.

1456
01:26:54,475 --> 01:26:56,477
- How did Tiny take it?
-( laughs)

1457
01:26:56,511 --> 01:26:59,117
She figured out
what she got herself into

1458
01:26:59,147 --> 01:27:01,058
the moment she saw my gun.

1459
01:27:01,082 --> 01:27:03,323
She knew she'd been had.

1460
01:27:06,387 --> 01:27:08,890
Oh, Emmett,

1461
01:27:08,923 --> 01:27:11,733
I got no wedding finger left
for you to put a ring on.

1462
01:27:13,595 --> 01:27:16,804
Well, that's not gonna make us
any less married, baby.

1463
01:27:20,001 --> 01:27:23,210
You was always
such a gentleman, Emmett.

1464
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:25,582
You make me feel
real good about myself.

1465
01:27:26,674 --> 01:27:28,950
I knew from the moment
I laid eyes on you

1466
01:27:28,977 --> 01:27:31,583
that you was different
than Dale,

1467
01:27:31,613 --> 01:27:34,389
that you was a real man.

1468
01:27:34,415 --> 01:27:36,486
(starts engine)

1469
01:27:41,389 --> 01:27:43,767
A real man.

1470
01:27:47,629 --> 01:27:49,973
