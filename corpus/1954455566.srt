00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,521
Welcome

2
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,524
THE MOTHER OF ALL TOADS

3
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,811
Here we were in France with all
Types of gargoyles on the wall.

4
00:04:45,846 --> 00:04:47,768
- Honey, can we go?
- That's so impressive.

5
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,925
This is the "Green Man" is a
pagan fertility symbol.

6
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,324
You you have to watch the time.
They're so cool.

7
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,125
- Be careful.
- What?

8
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,242
If you have touched it
they might buy.

9
00:05:00,277 --> 00:05:04,723
It may very
like to try once.

10
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,925
Thank you.

11
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,249
- Thank you.
- Are you American?

12
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,242
Yes.

13
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,448
Enter
wonderful couple from.

14
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,962
- Thank you.
- Darling, you're wonderful.

15
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,770
- Let's see.
- I want her.

16
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,647
- Do you like it?
This is the "older characters'.

17
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,809
What're you talking about?

18
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,964
The "ÄItere characters'
of H.P. Lovecraft.

19
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,961
- The Necronomicon and stuff.
- Yes, you're right.

20
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,121
- Was not that a hoax?
- Of course not.

21
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,330
They come from a very old source,

22
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,368
which has been for generations
Part of my family is.

23
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,682
And I explore traditions, but fits.

24
00:05:45,717 --> 00:05:47,762
He calls anthropology.

25
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,370
If you are interested, have
You come this afternoon.

26
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,167
Honey, we can not
Afternoon. We already have plans.

27
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,563
This is on our way.
I think we get back.

28
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,446
Which we will discuss in the car.

29
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,005
Is that enough? It is
only slightly wrinkled.

30
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,088
It's French.
I do not understand.

31
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,803
Yes, we're in France.
You have to get used to you.

32
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,563
Otherwise, would you rather have in
should remain the States.

33
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,250
Okay, listen, honey, I mean ...

34
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,685
Why do not you go to the spa?

35
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,247
And on the way you bring me
then decreases. It is on the way.

36
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,243
Do not you see, she says, that she
a copy of the Necronomicon has.

37
00:07:10,278 --> 00:07:13,485
That I have to check,
why I'm here.

38
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,565
She has a copy on a
Found market in Mirepoix.

39
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,762
I need to go there. It is perhaps
just another fake.

40
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,784
I have to check it. So do
your thing. Let you make the nails,

41
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:27,329
go to the hammam. That's okay. But
Now let's enjoy the ride.

42
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,607
We could turn left at Benet
should, as I had said.

43
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:57,490
I am now, I am left
bent to Benet.

44
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,886
No. Turn left at Benet
You listen to me not.

45
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,606
- Baby ...
- Just keep driving.

46
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,120
- What the hell is that?
- What?

47
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,769
Wow. Look das. you
You show your face on.

48
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,489
- Yes, 5 is a cross.
- This is not just a cross.

49
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,722
It belongs not to the intersection.

50
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,283
Over here was a spiritual ver-
collection site from the time of the Gauls.

51
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,808
Well, you would have our favorite
Holiday paid more attention ...

52
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,003
Then ... we would not have moved.
- Proceed?

53
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,001
Yes! Where are we? What is it for
a place? I do not understand.

54
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,242
We have not lost our way.
Do not you see what goes here?

55
00:09:00,277 --> 00:09:01,969
You Look at the sign,
the market.

56
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,363
The woman has a Necronomicon and
Earrings with the "ÄIteren characters."

57
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,091
This is the symbol of infinity.

58
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,446
You see, that is the co-
connection of two worlds, heaven and earth.

59
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,409
- Yes, it's a fucking night.
What are you talking about? - An eight.

60
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,325
I'm going to Spa.

61
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,242
- You can do what you want.
- This is not a fucking night ...

62
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,203
I see are
They come alone.

63
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,050
Karina had an appointment.

64
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,210
You probably do not heal your interests?

65
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,163
She does not think much of esotericism.

66
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,608
Sit down.

67
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,849
A Pastis from the area.

68
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,607
That is the custom in the region.

69
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,206
The book is very old.

70
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,526
I can not believe it,
but it looks real.

71
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,448
All the women in my family
have used it.

72
00:11:20,483 --> 00:11:24,525
In one way or
the other way.

73
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,605
Oh God ...

74
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,048
Great.

75
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,927
Fantastic. what is it?

76
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,407
The mothers of all the toads.

77
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,921
Do you really have
Go, my boy?

78
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,041
- Yes, it's pretty late.
- Then one more for the road.

79
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:10,320
The wine is mild you
warm on your way back.

80
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,724
I will not refuse.

81
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:23,525
It is your stomach
warming and other parts.

82
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,240
I should go now.

83
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:44,170
Do you like me now, handsome?

84
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,649
Shit.

85
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,251
One day I will have to
something to kill.

86
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,249
What the.

87
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,531
No ...

88
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,241
Why are you in such a hurry
gone, little one?

89
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,723
Stay away from me.
Stay away.

90
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,050
Why?

91
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:41,243
I can give you everything
give other women and more.

92
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,166
You are not a fucking woman!
You're a fucking freak!

93
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,771
No ...

94
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,128
No, no, no ...

95
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,846
you

96
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,163
What a story.

97
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,162
As imaginative.

98
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:57,122
Not every horror is
a creation of the divine.

99
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:19,361
I LOVE YOU

100
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,969
Shit.

101
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,966
Hi, it's me.
Call me back, please.

102
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,643
It is important.

103
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,644
Hey, George, it's me.

104
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,963
I'm with an ugly
Section woken by the hand.

105
00:24:27,998 --> 00:24:29,928
A broken glass or something.

106
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,926
Maybe I'm in a fight
advised. I can not remember.

107
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,084
I can not get Mona.
She does not answer my calls.

108
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,368
He does not sound very good.

109
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,888
Yesterday he had a fight and
can not even remember.

110
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,444
I'll talk to him, a few things
pack up and be right back.

111
00:25:01,479 --> 00:25:03,408
I do not think this is a good idea.

112
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,660
We should immediately go to Paris

113
00:25:06,695 --> 00:25:09,360
We settle down and disappear.

114
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,285
He would look for me.

115
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,846
That you're not, right?

116
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,441
I will bring him even to
that he understands.

117
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,080
Trust me, okay?

118
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,368
My God, where have you been?

119
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,690
Why did not you answer the phone
gone or have called me back?

120
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,367
I've told you a few days ago,
I'm going to my cousin.

121
00:25:43,402 --> 00:25:45,761
You two are not answered the phone.

122
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,844
I have dozens of you
Leave messages.

123
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,562
I needed some time
for me to think.

124
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,651
- And you?
- Yes, I have. It was good.

125
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,566
- That I had to do.
- Well, that makes me happy.

126
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,848
Because I love you so much missing.

127
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,290
What are you doing?

128
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,285
I pack a few things
together, then we can talk.

129
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:11,481
Why do you need to pack stuff?
You'll stay at home now, right?

130
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,084
So simple is not the
I have to decide yet.

131
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,805
Damn it ...

132
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,481
What I have done such a terrible thing?
Please, tell me!

133
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,561
You did not do anything. It is
to me. Try to understand it.

134
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,482
I'm trying,
But you say nothing at all!

135
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,685
Cut the crap
and look at me!

136
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,890
[What?

137
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:47,769
- You wear your wedding ring not. - I
know I've forgotten it at Danielle.

138
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,570
I'll get him,
when I go back.

139
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,771
You're not going anywhere, you are to
told you what's going on!

140
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,564
Do you want me now hold captive?
Why will not you grow up?

141
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,930
Stop it!

142
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,405
You ...

143
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,444
Bastard!
You are a real pig!

144
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,724
You were the last five days
not with Danielle! Where were you?

145
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:16,486
- You're being paranoid.
- You were not there, I know.

146
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,688
You controlled me?

147
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:24,123
I have to worry
you made. I love you.

148
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,207
You poor fool.

149
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,011
Do you not understand why
I can not stay here?

150
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,011
- Because you kill me.
- How do I kill you?

151
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,445
You do not even lets
for a minute alone.

152
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,165
When I go out, you want to know
where I'm going ...

153
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,482
What I do ... and
when I go back.

154
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,802
If I'm late,
I must explain myself.

155
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,887
I meet someone, you want to know
who it is and what we talked about.

156
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,203
- Do not have a right to know,
with whom my wife talking about? - No!

157
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:06,003
You call me 20 times a day
to just to check me.

158
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,125
I want to say hi.

159
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,607
And I'm sick of it, that you always
happened to be there, where am I going to show up.

160
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,850
At first I liked the
Attention. It was nice.

161
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,402
But now it's too much,
I can no longer live.

162
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,405
You want to have someone
which is always there for you.

163
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,162
The only live for you. Well,
I'm not. So nobody.

164
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,082
I know you're right.
I'm neurotic.

165
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,808
But only because I
love you so much.

166
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,610
Stop saying that. Do
you even know what that means?

167
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,047
It means that I love you.

168
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:04,046
I'm sorry that it got this far
is. I wanted it to work.

169
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,887
And we had a great time.
But I can not stay.

170
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,367
[E-Please.

171
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,890
- Give me one more chance.
- No, I can not.

172
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,285
- Please, I'll do anything
what you want. - No.

173
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,330
- I just do not rely on.
- No, you can not.

174
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,005
- Axel ...
- Please, give me a kiss.

175
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:29,523
- For the last time, then
you can go. - I'm leaving now.

176
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,281
Please, darling, fuck me harder, okay?

177
00:29:41,316 --> 00:29:43,765
Come on!

178
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,326
- I want to hurt you.
- I break not already!

179
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,528
Come on, fuck me harder!

180
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,283
Please, do not ruin me.

181
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,850
Do you, do you love me still.

182
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:33,326
- I'll still go.
- Why?

183
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,289
I do not understand.

184
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,882
We belong together. I can take you
happy, if you let me.

185
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,128
No, that's not true.

186
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,002
Please stay here and give us more
a chance. I'm begging you.

187
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,528
I can not.

188
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:59,243
If you met someone
all you need to tell me. I forgive you.

189
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,971
Otherwise it makes no sense.

190
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,970
Go into the living room.
I get to in a minute.

191
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,725
I'll tell you everything, you know what
want to know. The absolute truth.

192
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,730
I will not secretly
sneak out, I promise.

193
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,569
Okay.

194
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,131
That's so mean.

195
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,365
You know where that leads, right?

196
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,648
I think so.

197
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,931
Because I'm falling straight into you.

198
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,362
And I. In love with you

199
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:29,561
Then everything is clear. We must
just move in together.

200
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,970
We will get married and
spend our lives together.

201
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,568
We will have a home and a family.
All that happy people have.

202
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,808
I'd like that.

203
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,645
- A friend of yours?
- Who?

204
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:48,610
- The guy you smiled.
- No, I've never seen.

205
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,770
So, the absolute truth, right?

206
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,369
The truth ...

207
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,485
I admit that I last
Week was not at my cousin.

208
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,160
Yes, I was with someone
others together.

209
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:18,923
I was unfaithful to you, and now I want to
that other person to be around.

210
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,646
So I was not paranoid.

211
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,562
Just because you were right, that means
not that you're not paranoid.

212
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,489
- You admit that you deceived me?
- Yes.

213
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,971
I cheated, I
I lied and cheated on you.

214
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:39,288
- Who's this? - That 's got
nothing on. Nobody, you know.

215
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,171
- Do you love him?
- Yes.

216
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,849
Shit.

217
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,370
Why did you tell me this
not been said before?

218
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,363
Because I was afraid,
what would you do.

219
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,569
- I would never want to hurt you, you know that
du - No, you hurt yourself Inst.

220
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,364
You threaten with suicide.

221
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,891
Have you throw a handful of pills
and make me responsible.

222
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,964
- It was only once. - Yes, but
I've learned my lesson.

223
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,681
How long has this been?

224
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,681
The first time three years ago.

225
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,970
- The first time?
- Yes, 6 were others.

226
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,570
How many?

227
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,963
Hard to say
One-night stands included?

228
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,210
So, are you saying that
you're a whore and bitch?

229
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,284
Yes.

230
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,766
Do you remember the
internal bleeding that I had?

231
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:32,485
- The uterine infection?
- I told you.

232
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:37,003
- You need to eat something. - Sweet,
okay I go. I do not go hungry.

233
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,288
I just want to sleep,
go into the other room.

234
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,002
I stay here when you sleep
If you need anything.

235
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,363
My lover then
was married.

236
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,690
And he had his family
not leave for me.

237
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,528
And we were both safely
not ready for a child. So ...

238
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,240
Was it about me?

239
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:00,089
There was no one. It was
in me, and then it was outside.

240
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,603
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

241
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,766
Why that makes you so cold?
You love children.

242
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,124
Yes, by other people.

243
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,125
Also, I did not want to
always be bound to you.

244
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,410
So I've done things to me
hurting themselves and all around me.

245
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,850
I hold you and leave some
am to my sister to Paris.

246
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,925
Yes.

247
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,645
And you came back,
because you had me missing.

248
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,368
I'm not
therefore returned.

249
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,408
Are you ready?

250
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,405
I do not believe you.

251
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:50,604
Why do you think I have not since then
talked to my sister?

252
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,164
You say it all
just to get rid of me.

253
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,844
But I still love you.

254
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,848
I saw you at every opportunity
deceived and laughed at you.

255
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:08,849
I have not even washed,
so you smell the sex and freak out.

256
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,361
What I have done,
you hate me so much?

257
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,606
I always thought it would be
your weakness, your selfishness ...

258
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,011
And ... your passive-aggressive kind
But it's the little things.

259
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,011
The way you're out of your shirt
zuknöpfst top down.

260
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,329
The way you
chew your food.

261
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,529
The nature,
as you fuck me.

262
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,127
Like I was a
fragile porcelain doll

263
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,801
that you put back on the shelf,
when you're done.

264
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:40,521
You and your gentle
Orgasm tender as a whisper.

265
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,403
I want a screaming
fucked.

266
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,045
Your penis and my vagina
never liked each other.

267
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,721
Have you ever noticed?

268
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:55,882
In five years, I'm not even
come, and that has never heard you.

269
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,890
Can I ask you something?

270
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,330
- What?
- Are you pregnant?

271
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,882
You think I'm leaving you, because I
get someone else's baby?

272
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,886
- That would be a reason.
- Not for me.

273
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,048
You are cruel and
injured people.

274
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:19,249
This new guy I'm almost sorry. White
he, with what kind of woman he's sleeping?

275
00:37:19,284 --> 00:37:21,811
He will find out soon enough.

276
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,767
If we had then clarified everything?

277
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,171
Let us now separate ways
before we get even more hurt?

278
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,883
Do you think you could have me
hurt more than you've done it?

279
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,890
I do not know.

280
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,286
I want to find out either.

281
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,328
I'm sorry.

282
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,165
Where would you go?
To him?

283
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,051
You can give me those questions
no longer provide.

284
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,921
Will I be this mysterious
Man know?

285
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,645
I do not know.

286
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,362
I wanted to tell you not,
but now it does not matter anymore.

287
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,970
I think a biopsy last week
and the results are not clear.

288
00:38:14,005 --> 00:38:16,850
- B could be cancer.
- Stop it, it does not work this time.

289
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,123
The major medical emergency?

290
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,363
Why does George
on your phone to?

291
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,930
Hi, George. It's me.
what's up! '

292
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,086
She is here. Yes, come up.
They would be sure to see you.

293
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,682
But give her a minute,
they must still attract.

294
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,491
For you.

295
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,927
Hi, no, all good
I'm going now.

296
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,844
No, please no.

297
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,443
Fucking asshole!

298
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,648
May

299
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,167
Hey.

HI.

301

Shit.

302
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,124
Mona! Bloody hell,
what happened?

303
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:24,922
I'm going this time for good-who
. leave You can not stop me.

304
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,371
[Mona!

305
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,450
Oh my God!

306
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,929
George did this to you!

307
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,368
You did not leave me,
and he is on? IPPT!

308
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,569
No, honey, he's not.

309
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,363
I'm going now.

310
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,084
Let's see how you love me
back this time fetch.

311
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,563
No, I meant 5 not so!
I'm so sorry!

312
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:08,251
Please, do not leave me!
Please come back!

313
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,564
Damn it!
I curse you!

314
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,881
Do not worry, darling.
You will not be alone.

315
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,810
Because I'll go with you.

316
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,210
Son of a bitch!

317
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,570
I ...

318
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,970
I love you.

319
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,969
I love you.

320
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,689
I love you.

321
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,849
I love you.

322
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,209
I love you.

323
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,287
I love ...

324
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:23,769
Maybe I'm wrong.

325
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,371
Am I wrong.

326
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,409
Pause. And more.

327
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,284
What's your story?

328
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,043
WET DREAMS

329
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,889
What's going on?

330
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,484
Baby. I'm so sorry.

331
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,484
Are you okay?

332
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,402
Did you go?

333
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,205
The remote control
damn remote?

334
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,207
No ..

335
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,211
Could you help the
Stealers play tonight.

336
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,410
Then look at the Stealers.

337
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,008
But I need the remote control.

338
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,160
The last time I had me a
Program on lifestyle look.

339
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:57,081
Valerie Botanelli over
Cancer or some shit.

340
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,405
- You're going out?
- Had I told you.

341
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:05,241
I have this thing with Percy. The
Christmas bonus depends.

342
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,886
I come to early
Home promised.

343
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,320
You promise a lot.

344
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:20,242
Jesus Christ, come on,
I slept.

345
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:23,210
Take some makeup.

346
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,488
You will not even notice.

347
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:31,321
My mother will notice the fifth
She is coming tomorrow for dinner.

348
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,684
- What do I tell her?
- Tell her ...

349
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,602
- You have to do, they should next
Weeks to come. - Yes, next week.

350
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,804
Why not.

351
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,322
Breakfast is ready.

352
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,043
And this is repeated night after night.

353
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,450
You and your wife served
your cock for breakfast?

354
00:47:09,485 --> 00:47:11,727
Not very Freudian.

355
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,963
Do you meet up with a new one?

356
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:21,202
Meet with a new one?
You mean, if I fuck a new one?

357
00:47:21,237 --> 00:47:24,443
Yeah, I mean,
fuck you new one.

358
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,885
Not at the moment.

359
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:31,770
What's with the wife of your
Dreams? With the loving vagina

360
00:47:31,805 --> 00:47:34,684
Is it someone who
you know?

361
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,605
No ..

362
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,120
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

363
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,728
I gotta a very
ask sensitive questions.

364
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,850
When did you last
Time someone raped?

365
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:56,406
I rape always' my
Mother. Of course in my dreams.

366
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:00,890
I did even people.
I kill people I love.

367
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:07,522
I should do, what you
to charge for these sessions.

368
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,010
The point is, dreams can
how can be a liberation.

369
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,246
As a safety valve.

370
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:21,563
They allow us to do things we
could not do in real life.

371
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,690
Sometimes it is the only
Truth that we have.

372
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,531
It is the reality of the soul.

373
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,441
Real life is the distraction.

374
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:42,286
I will not explain,
I just want it to stop.

375
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:46,005
Have you tried
to open your eyes?

376
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,367
I'm serious. The moment when
which you realize that you're dreaming ...

377
00:48:50,402 --> 00:48:54,331
You can use your mind ...
try to stop it.

378
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,805
Okay ..

379
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:03,524
- And how do I do that? - Full
simple. Close your eyes and count.

380
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:08,171
That's what you get back, right?
Three, two, one ...

381
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,323
wake up.

382
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,728
Over here! Hey!

383
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,361
Carla?

384
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,165
Hey, you ..

385
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,447
I have the remote control
found.

386
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,842
Maxine! No!

387
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,928
Carla, let them free!

388
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,410
Maxine! Carla wait, that thing!
What the hell?

389
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,969
Carla, stop it!

390
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,731
Okay, you get
what you wanted.

391
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,923
Please, let me go.

392
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,849
No, Danny.

393
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,086
What the hell do you want from me?

394
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,245
The truth.

395
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,966
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about your wife.

396
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,765
- Let me free!
- The woman you married.

397
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:06,923
Which you promised to honor her
and love until death separates you.

398
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,768
What the shell?

399
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,564
I dream ...

400
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,050
It is a dream.

401
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,170
Three ...

402
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,925
Two ... ...

403
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:32,886
. One!

404
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,445
Wow.!

405
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,808
You look great. You
look like a movie star.

406
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,648
- Were you able to sleep?
- Like a baby.

407
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,850
- Apart.
- Thank you.

408
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:41,888
- What is it?
Smells delicious.

409
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:45,567
That's it. when
you want, do one.

410
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,207
No, not today.

411
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,884
Are you okay?

412
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,249
- Yes.
- Look.

413
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:55,770
Maxine.

414
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,640
Can not we
more hurt.

415
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:05,170
- Poor baby, are you okay?
- Yes.

416
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,970
I gave you a few
Gifts brought.

417
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:21,488
Carla do not forget,
to feed it.

418
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,804
Good morning.

419
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,326
Breakfast time.

420
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:45,124
Hold on, Tiger. I just want
to see how you're doing down there.

421
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:08,008
It looks good.
Do you see?

422
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:15,724
You were completely ready for
surgery last night.

423
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:22,169
I thought I'd never see the day
where Donny missed the big game.

424
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:28,764
I would have taken for you
But you know me ...

425
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:36,290
You're the expert
with the remote control.

426
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,571
You can not even one
Replace the bulb.

427
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:44,690
Or is it your own
Women get.

428
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,486
But when it comes to
Remotes are ...

429
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:52,089
Donny ... is a black belt carrier.

430
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:00,243
You want to say something?
Yes? Really?

431
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:06,491
If I pick it, promise
then you tell me not to spit again?

432
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:11,409
You are not as good at
Keeping promises, Danny.

433
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:17,281
You will of the one-eyed monster
Mix your legs dominates.

434
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:06,483
Okay, I'll bite.
what's so funny?

435
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:12,809
You. You are sick,
damn witch.

436
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:19,289
I'm going to start with
rip out the tits.

437
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:25,763
For starters? Wow.
That is a threat.

438
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:29,485
How you gonna do that?
I mean ...

439
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:34,167
I am stunned.
No offense.

440
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:39,482
I just have my eyes
close and count to three,

441
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:43,122
and then when I wake up,
I will kill you.

442
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:48,409
Do you understand me, Carla?

443
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:51,686
I will kill you really.

444
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:02,884
Ready or not,
here I come.

445
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,281
Three ...

446
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:07,721
Two ... ...

447
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,166
Three, two, one!

448
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:17,885
Three, two ...

449
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:19,486
A.

450
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:23,403
Three, two, one!

451
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:29,331
You were right, that was
really a funny joke.

452
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,403
Especially the punch line.

453
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:37,611
This is my dream, bitch.

454
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:53,886
You can lock us ... Stories.

455
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:57,689
Even if they are our own.

456
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:05,403
Especially when they
are our own.

457
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:28,362
The power of his, own
Writing stories ...

458
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:32,361
... Is the power
ennoble his life.

459
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:39,409
Ennoble his life.

460
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:18,723
THE ACCIDENT

461
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:27,401
Why do we die, Mommy?

462
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:37,327
Treasures, to make room for the new
People who are born every day.

463
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:43,008
There is limited
Place in the world.

464
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:11,771
Does that mean grandmother
died ...

465
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,891
... To make room for me?

466
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:19,209
No ..

467
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:22,521
That does not mean entirely.

468
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:27,606
Grandmother died because her body
no longer worked.

469
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:33,884
And you've helped grandmother,
so long to stay alive.

470
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:39,324
How?

471
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:44,449
You were the reason that
she woke up in the morning.

472
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:49,850
So you happy they're doing.

473
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:53,927
Yes, I suppose, grandmother
was really very old.

474
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:58,891
Will I ever get old?

475
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:04,289
This takes a bit longer.

476
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:17,003
But this man was not old.

477
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:23,804
No, he was not.

478
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:28,450
Why is he dead?

479
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:59,444
Sometimes things just happen.

480
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:22,130
Maybe he has done something bad?

481
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:26,846
People do not die for
that they do bad things.

482
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:30,925
They are sent to her room,
if they were naughty.

483
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:34,451
Or they are in the oven, as
the wicked witch in the gingerbread house.

484
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:38,685
Since you're lucky that you do not
fit into our oven.

485
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:42,048
- Maybe I let Daddy buy one.
- No!

486
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,889
Oh my God.

487
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:59,642
Stay in the car.

488
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,851
We're on the Highway
north of ...

489
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:59,328
No, he is not.

490
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,930
Could be his father.

491
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,642
Okay, they send someone?

492
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,164
Mama is the man
ever wake up?

493
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:16,250
No ..

494
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:20,886
I am not afraid.

495
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:25,409
Perhaps as a zombie
or something?

496
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:32,969
Not even as a zombie. and if
but then determined to be a good zombie.

497
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:42,168
Why his daddy did it?

498
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:38,607
It's like a small
Tommy, when Old Yeller got sick.

499
01:08:38,642 --> 01:08:40,602
Do you remember?

500
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,128
Why do we die?

501
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:47,926
I really do not know.

502
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:54,849
What I do know is that,
while we're here ...

503
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:01,922
... We should be as good as
possible care for one another.

504
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:09,121
If we die then ...

505
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:13,647
... We all die happy.

506
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:34,444
So happy to say
die as much as ...

507
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:35,442
They lived happily ...
the end of their days?

508
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,645
Yes.

509
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,084
Exactly.

510
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:48,563
It's like, they lived happily
until the end of their days.

511
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:28,361
Well, in order to refine his life ...

512
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,807
... You have to live it.

513
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:58,168
I'm sorry.

514
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:02,488
It is easier to get into the story
another catch ...

515
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:05,406
... Live as his own.

516
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:37,571
Stained VISIONS

517
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:35,564
I love you.

518
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:43,042
I only chose women
who wanted to die.

519
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,369
And if you think about it,
I give them a voice.

520
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:51,121
Something they never had in life.

521
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:56,361
Thanks to me, is all that they experienced
have, not just disappear.

522
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:59,241
I keep her story.

523
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:02,288
I love them.

524
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:12,160
The most important images that
People see in their lives ...

525
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:15,170
The key moments ...
their experiences

526
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:18,967
be in a liquid
stored in their eyes.

527
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:24,121
And I've discovered that these visions
transferable to other people.

528
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,765
By a simple
surgery.

529
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:33,563
At the moment of her death, they see
again her life in her eyes.

530
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:39,568
This has become my work.
I'm her biographer.

531
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:49,609
I must admit that I always
had a terrible handicap.

532
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:53,051
I can not dream.

533
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:59,924
But that does not matter anymore. Their
Dreams give me finally make sense.

534
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,441
To live here is that
Hazard of my trade.

535
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,482
To understand it,
I need as they live.

536
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:02,283
The fact that I do not
exists, is okay with me.

537
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:05,605
The only thing that counts,
These are the books.

538
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:10,008
I'm just a formality.

539
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:24,681
A formality with a body.
That's my only weakness.

540
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:41,825
I'm just in the stories
interests of women.

541
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:45,211
They are the true creators.
Those who suffer.

542
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:49,603
The predictable stories
the men do not interest me.

543
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:52,686
No blood, no life.

544
01:19:56,840 --> 01:20:00,606
The strongest memories come
of women who have lived long.

545
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:03,168
Anything and everything that had
have lost.

546
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:04,805
Either because they had chosen
or wrong decisions.

547
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:10,408
These stories to
most hurt.

548
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:16,603
Then I feel like everything
they felt.

549
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:49,685
What do the unborn?
What they think or feel?

550
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:03,410
Find out, could the
Key to life itself.

551
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:24,211
No, not my baby-making!
Let go of me!

552
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:26,885
You

553
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:35,890
What do you have of my baby
taken? What did you do?

554
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:37,690
Damn ...

555
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:01,686
My baby ...

556
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:01,161
Maybe you should wake up at last.

557
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:05,409
Fetus can not
see, you idiot.

558
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:10,680
How do you want a vision of something on-
Write that does not even have eyes?

559
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:15,322
You'll find out more,
should know as a soul.

560
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:19,605
And you will regret 5,
then wanted to have.

561
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:23,201
Have you ever wondered where these
Voice is in your head?

562
01:27:23,236 --> 01:27:25,487
That voice that tells you
what to do?

563
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:32,488
All the people you wrote about the
you are all recycled souls.

564
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:38,210
There is nothing unique to humans.

565
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:41,082
Not a bit.

566
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:45,605
Only creatures with
predestined life ...

567
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:50,248
. The die, and then another
to live miserable scenario,

568
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:54,604
created by a Creator with
a very short attention span.

569
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:57,525
And it is all for his pleasure.

570
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:01,131
Do you think you write the original
Stories of people?

571
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:04,124
Nothing is original, you
're just a Plagiatorin.

572
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:06,442
Shut up!

573
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:09,320
Shut up!

574
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:13,407
So I keep my mouth shut,
you have to close your eyes.

575
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:19,763
Listen to fool around with things
should know that no living person.

576
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:23,810
Exactly.

577
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:27,528
There is only one way to really
nothing more to see.

578
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:32,165
TU!

579
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:35,250
TU!

580
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:39,044
TU!

581
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:45,331
TU!

582
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:47,806
TU!

583
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:01,447
I suddenly see more clearly
than I have ever done.

584
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:05,443
It is wonderful to be forgotten,
what I had learned.

585
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:09,646
No more cravings
have to know everything.

586
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:14,891
Sometimes it is better to eyes
to close and to be led.

587
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:22,251
I can not see, but
Finally, I can dream again.

588
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:13,131
The stories are
to life. - ...

589
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:19,929
even if the true
World disappears ...

590
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:25,841
Until there is nothing left ...
as the storyteller.

591
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:39,442
A storyteller,
whom you trust completely.

592
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:10,086
SWEETS

593
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:16,651
It's not you,
but me.

594
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:26,050
How can such a thing
just as expressionless say?

595
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:28,328
It's up to you?

596
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:32,850
What about you?

597
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:38,128
I need some space.

598
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:40,845
Okay ...

599
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:44,123
Hey, I'll give you space.

600
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:46,721
Look here.
Do you see?

601
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:49,568
Look.

602
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,968
Do you see? We ...

603
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:55,881
We have enough space. Can
we not go?

604
01:32:57,680 --> 01:33:00,286
I need some time to myself.

605
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,287
Why are you so selfish?

606
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:11,041
I'm selfish!
You are selfish!

607
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:15,243
S me went well before you
you came into my life.

608
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:34,363
It was fun. But you could
better than I get.

609
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:38,363
Maybe I want no better than you.

610
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:43,006
Maybe you think that you know what
Get better as I could?

611
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:46,126
I'm done.
I feel terribly upset.

612
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:50,445
Everyone has their problems, okay?

613
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:53,486
What's on your so special?

614
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:57,562
We talked about it.
Again and again and again.

615
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:03,762
You know that I
meet with others, right?

616
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:07,686
I did not know!

617
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:14,610
But why did you
asked me for exclusivity?

618
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:18,768
You have exclusivity
asked, why?

619
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,844
You tell people not yet,
I'm your friend, right?

620
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:50,971
I'll talk to anybody.

621
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:52,481
I'll call anybody!

622
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:57,931
I want to just spend time with you,
because they mean nothing.

623
01:34:58,120 --> 01:34:59,929
You know.

624
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:05,489
I am not currently ready for a
Relationship. I have yet gentle to me.

625
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:08,566
You've begged!

626
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,045
I wanted to take it slow!

627
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:14,045
You have my efforts
challenged!

628
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:18,768
I have accepted the challenge
and see something I like very much!

629
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:20,968
Just like you!

630
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:56,091
I love you. But I'm
no longer in love with you.

631
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:00,601
What is the difference?

632
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,890
Let's start again.

633
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:08,285
We can get it done better.

634
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:13,282
- Please, I love you!
- And I love you ...

635
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:18,121
... As a friend.

636
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:22,929
Friends to be something not to.

637
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:25,488
Sweet, you're breaking my heart.

638
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:28,811
Do not do this to us!
We are a good match!

639
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:32,364
We fit together so well.

640
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:35,802
We are well ...

641
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,604
Ball! -

642
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,809
Stop it.

643
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:38,886
You're doing it harder,
as it should be.

644
01:37:39,240 --> 01:37:43,211
Why you got me all
presented to your friends?

645
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:46,490
They seemed to like me.

646
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:50,203
They said that the chemistry
right between us.

647
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:52,609
You you want to secure.

648
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:55,846
I feel only
no longer the same.

649
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:00,888
Why?

650
01:38:01,720 --> 01:38:05,520
Do you do that with every guy like that?

651
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:08,002
No, with you it was different.

652
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:12,603
But one morning I woke up
and something had changed.

653
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:14,804
I can not help my feelings.

654
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:17,522
This has happened before,
I'm sorry.

655
01:38:19,120 --> 01:38:20,087
Nothing is ever
time passes ...

656
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:29,331
I feel in
so special.

657
01:39:14,640 --> 01:39:17,246
S not you get!

658
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:20,487
You have to remove from me.

659
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:26,089
I do not want, please.

660
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:28,530
Please ...

661
01:39:29,320 --> 01:39:31,084
Please.

662
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:35,210
I love you.
Really, I love you.

663
01:39:36,040 --> 01:39:38,611
Thought for a moment
I, you were different.

664
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:43,884
Please.

665
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:48,246
But you're just another
pathetic, little lamb.

666
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:53,250
Please, give me another chance.

667
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:04,810
Fine.

668
01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:07,282
See you later.

669
01:40:10,240 --> 01:40:13,722
I miss you!
I miss you so much!

670
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:17,527
I know that you do.

671
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:09,731
Baby, good evening.

672
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:13,927
- How are you 5?
- Terrible.

673
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:16,444
Do not feel bad.

674
01:41:17,200 --> 01:41:22,161
I admire this woman. You
is one of my best friends.

675
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:31,891
Michelle Evidenci, and you are?

676
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:35,166
- We already know.
- Are we?

677
01:41:35,480 --> 01:41:37,209
We have already
seen a few times.

678
01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:41,121
Antonia is a friend.
A good friend.

679
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:43,530
Well ...

680
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:46,405
Is pure.

681
01:41:46,440 --> 01:41:48,890
Have fun.

682
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:10,003
I want to stop eating.
That's my goal.

683
01:42:11,160 --> 01:42:15,085
At least for a few weeks,
to prove to myself that I can.

684
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:17,847
You have to do everything in moderation.

685
01:42:19,160 --> 01:42:22,130
Unfortunately, I am not so
well is to live in moderation.

686
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:25,882
I can not help it,
I just love to swallow.

687
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:30,451
I wanted anyway
a break.

688
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:34,966
- Soon, I have ever
made, that's okay. - Me too.

689
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:36,441
Soon.

690
01:42:36,680 --> 01:42:38,170
We could do together.

691
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:41,081
- That would be a better person
make of me. - Right.

692
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:44,363
We were both
better people.

693
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:48,527
What about our friends.
You would not understand.

694
01:42:49,680 --> 01:42:51,125
Friends come and go.

695
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:55,130
If they do not appreciate,
what I do for me, then fuck it.

696
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:57,203
They can be replaced.

697
01:42:59,880 --> 01:43:02,247
But let tomorrow
worried about it.

698
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:05,649
Yes, fuck it.
It tastes too good.

699
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:13,649
- I do not eat appetizers.
- One of my best friends.

700
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:36,321
Until I get what I
wants, it's just me.

701
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:39,245
- How it should be.
- I agree.

702
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:44,320
I am my own person. And who
does not see this, you must read the book ...

703
01:43:44,355 --> 01:43:45,845
... About me.

704
01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:51,683
It's not that I do not care all.
But no one is as interesting as I ...

705
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:54,561
me.

706
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:57,770
It's about me or
nothing. Just me.

707
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:00,163
Me, me, me ...

708
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:02,289
Me, me, me ...

709
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:09,284
Shit!

710
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:54,570
God!

711
01:44:59,200 --> 01:45:00,770
God!

712
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:04,329
No, no!

713
01:45:09,160 --> 01:45:10,844
Why?

714
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:13,601
Please ...

715
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:16,367
I love you!

716
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:22,364
I'm sorry.

717
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:25,168
I am ruined.

718
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:12,364
At the end ...

719
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:19,762
... Whatever the case, happened
always one of two things.

720
01:47:21,240 --> 01:47:23,368
It always happens.

721
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:27,683
The storyteller
continues or ...

722
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:31,091
. Your story.

723
01:47:32,720 --> 01:47:34,802
Past ... ...

724
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:38,081
... Before you notice anything.
