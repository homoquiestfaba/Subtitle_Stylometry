it was amazing
meeting you last week.

8

I hope you did too.

it's Guy Carter again.

Just wondering
if there's any news.

17
00:01:37,665 --> 00:01:41,033
You said I'd hear by Monday
at the latest and...

18
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:43,168
it's now Friday.

19
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,171
(Beep) I don't mean
to keep bugging you,

20
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:49,741
but you basically said
I had the job. (Beep)

21
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:53,479
Hey, hi, I just...
I was thinking,

22
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:57,249
if it's easier for you
to text or to e-mail,

23
00:01:57,251 --> 00:01:59,151
that's totally cool.
(Beep)

24
00:01:59,153 --> 00:02:02,988
Hey, it's Guy Carter.
It's Guy Carter, again.

(Beep)
Oh, it's Guy Carter.

26
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:07,793
I don't want you to lose out

31
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,073
who interviewed
three times

32
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:23,208
and who you said
was a shoe-in?

33
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,177
How do you not
hire someone

34
00:02:25,179 --> 00:02:27,179
who you said had the best book you'd ever seen?

35
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:28,814
I deserve this job.

36
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:33,652
(Beep) I can only assume the
reason you're not calling me back

37
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,888
is because you're
too busy...

38
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,223
chomping on huge dicks.

39
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:41,326
It's just a big dick
breakfast over there.

40
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,962
Dick omelets
and dick pancakes.

41
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:45,697
Scrambled dick.
Dick Benedict.

42
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:49,001
All you can eat dick.
Would you like another mimosa with your dick?

43
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:50,235
There's a dick
carving station.

44
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:52,704
You're just grabbing
as much dick.

45
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:54,907
Oh no, that's okay,
I'm fine with my dick.

46
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:57,242
Your plate is filled
with dick

47
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:59,545
and then your mouth
is filled.

48
00:02:59,547 --> 00:03:01,446
(Gagging)

49
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:03,515
In fact, it's
so full of dick,

50
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:06,952
that I can't pick up the phone
and make a simple--

51
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:09,154
Man on the phone:
<i>Guy. Rob Veckmann.</i>

52
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:10,856
<i>The reason</i>
<i>I didn't call you</i>

53
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:13,358
<i>is because my wife's been</i>
<i>plowing my business partner.</i>

54
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,562
<i>They took over the company</i>
<i>and fired me.</i>

55
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:18,463
Oh, man.

56
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:23,202
Oh, that's...
Wow! I had no idea.

57

Rob: <i>Yeah, there's a lot</i>
<i>you don't know. Dick.</i>

Anne: You alright
in here, chief?

61
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:50,996
How long have you been
standing there?

62
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:53,365
Long enough to hear
the dick buffet.

63
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:58,003
Guy...

64
00:03:58,005 --> 00:03:59,838
you're making
yourself crazy.

65
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:06,878
How's the crib
coming along?

66
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:11,283
It's getting there.

67
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:13,318
You know, not assembling
that thing

68
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,255
isn't gonna stop her
from coming out of me.

69
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:18,624
Why would I want
to stop her?

70
00:04:18,626 --> 00:04:22,928
Although, I mean,
I guess I wouldn't be totally upset

71
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,330
if she held off
another eight months.

72
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:28,300
That's funny. I was thinking
if she came sooner,

73
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:30,535
like say, before Tuesday,

74
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:33,038
we'd still have health insurance to cover it.

75
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:38,543
What is that supposed
to mean?

76
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:40,112
Umm...

77
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:42,514
Well, pretty much
what it sounds like.

78
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:44,616
Wait? Are you--
You're serious.

79
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,552
Anne? How are you just
telling me this now?

80
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:49,354
I don't... You were
so stressed out

81
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:51,456
I didn't wanna
make it worse.

82
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,992
It looked like the Resource thing was happening,

83
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,427
so I didn't mention it.

84
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:58,363
But now,
I'm mentioning it.

85
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:02,134
They have to give you some sort of grace period, right?

86
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:05,003
They did.
It ends Tuesday.

87
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:10,309
I mean, I assumed you'd
be working by now.

88
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:13,445
Yeah. Well, we dropped
the ball on that one.

89
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:16,214
I'm sorry, "we"?
Meaning me?

90
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:17,749
You quit your job.

91
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:20,419
Because we got pregnant.

92
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,357
I can't talk about this
right now.

93
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:27,693
I'm gonna make tea.

94
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,029
Anne...

102
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:17,609
Anne: Here.

103
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:18,610
What is this?

104
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:20,312
Anne: I found it
on Craigslist.

105
00:06:20,314 --> 00:06:22,681
It's the only thing
remotely realistic.

106
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:24,149
Now If you studied
dental hygiene,

107
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:27,452
that would really open up
our options.

108
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:34,025
You want me to be
a delivery guy?

109
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:37,396
I want you to be anything if it
pays the insurance by Tuesday.

110
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:39,598
That will buy us
another month,

111
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,266
unless of course you want me to call my parents

112
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:42,934
and ask for more money
again.

113
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,369
It is an option.

114
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:47,472
No. No, it is not
an option, Anne.

115
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:49,374
I don't wanna go into labor
and find out the "repo man"

116

towed my car
out of the driveway.

117
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,078
There's no such thing
as the "repo man."

118
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,679
Of course there is.

119
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:56,715
Have you ever seen
a repo man...

120
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:58,717
not counting the Emilio Estevez movie?

121
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:03,155
Guy, I'm not gonna argue
the existence of repo men

122
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:04,289
because they're real.

123
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,258
What do they come with,
a tow truck

124
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,059
or a fleet of unicorns?

125
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,528
My half-brother's mom Sandy,

126
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,396
said that she had
her car taken

127
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:13,365
and I believe it was
by a repo man, okay?

128
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:17,335
What? They are not...
I might throw up on you.

129
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:18,870
Guy: You're not gonna
throw up on me.

130
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:20,505
A little bit.

131
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:24,843
Why don't you go lie down and I'll bring you something?
Okay?

132
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:26,929
(Groaning)

133
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:29,014
Go! Go lay down,
I'll bring you something.

134
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:33,084
Anne: They're real.

135

<i>(Door creaks)</i>
Guy: Here you go.

136
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,960
For your tummy.

137
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,307
Sorry for being
such a baby.

138
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:57,742
I know you're frustrated.

139
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:00,946

140
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:02,614
It's just so stupid.

141
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:05,450
I'm supposed to have
my ducks in a row by now.

142
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:08,887
Maybe it's okay to not
have your ducks in a row.

143
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:11,957
It's not okay.
Ducks have to be in a row.

144
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:16,695
Have you ever seen ducks?
They're sorta crazy.

145
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:21,633
They like to run around,
do shit.

146
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:25,604
No, I don't...
Not my ducks.

147
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:28,607
My ducks are different
than your ducks.

148
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:30,475
Mine are not running
around and crazy.

149
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:32,744
They have an objective,
they have a plan.

150
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:34,579
They wanna get
somewhere in life.

151
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:37,082
Then they're like
walking in a line,

152
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:39,384
otherwise known
as a row.

153
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:41,353
Honey, oww.

154
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:43,421
Then call the number.

155
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:45,123

Oh, a question...

165
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:13,285
This may be
a little premature,

166
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:15,487
but are there benefits?

Oh.
You got me there.

176
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:29,694
But, fret not, I got a buddy
that will drive you.

177
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:33,431
Um-hm.
About six foot.

178
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:36,534
Serious, clean.
Like a cop.

179
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:39,938
No, he's not a real cop.

180
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,574
I can promise you
he will not hit on you.

181
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:46,645
How do I know?
'Cause he's gay.

182
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:50,015
Gay as fuck.

183
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:52,050
Real gay.

184
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:54,386
No, he got a sweet ride.

185
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:56,488
A Volvo.

186
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,256
Yeah, yeah.

187
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:01,292
Don't get pissy with me.
I'm trying to hook you up.

188
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,461
Sit.

189
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:05,463
Okay, bye.

190
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:07,832
You O negative?

191
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,300
No, I'm...

192
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:12,370
I'm not talking to you.
Uh-huh.

193
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:14,072
Right.
Are you O negative?

194
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:16,908
No, I'm-- I'm not talkin' to you.
Hold up.

195
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:20,078
All right,
I love you too. Bye.

196
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,479
You the one just called?

197
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:24,315
Yeah, I'm Guy.

198
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:29,087
I'm Zoley. Congratulations.
You're hired.

199
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:35,026
Okay... Well,
what am I gonna be driving?

200
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:38,063
Pizzas?
Dry cleaning? What?

201
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:42,267
Girls. The first one's
named Nikki.

202
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:43,435
Huh.

203
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,539
You didn't mention that
in your ad.

204
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,607
It's all above board,
man.

205
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:51,376
You're not doin'
anything illegal,

206
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:52,377
you're just drivin'
a car.

207
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,480
Pickin' up, droppin' off.

208
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:57,482
Easy as cake.

209
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,486
What are the benefits?

210
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:04,389
Well, you play
your cards right,

211
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,890
there can be
all kinds of benefits.

212
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:09,194
Know what I'm sayin'?
(Chuckles)

213
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:14,966
Guy, you about this life,
or what?

214
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:19,170
No, no no no...
I'm... Yes... I'm...

215
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:20,638
I'm about this life.

216
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,708
Okay, all right.
Mm-hmm. Okay, sweet.

217
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,578
Here's where she's at.

218
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,880
Oh, whoa. Now?
You want me to start now?

219
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:32,317
Right now, yes.
Nikki is waitin'.

220
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:34,753
And Nikki do not
like to wait.

221
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:13,691
Hi. I'm Guy.

222
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:16,594
Guy, with the sweet
ride, Guy?

223
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:19,597
That'd be me.

224
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:22,600
Call me Nikki,
Nikki Winters.

225
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:24,969
And next time,
don't be late.

226
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:32,443
(Groans)

227
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:40,385
So where are we going?

228
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:42,320
Bel-Air.

229
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:54,165
Female Voice on GPS:
<i>Please proceed to the highlighted route.</i>

230
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,234
Want music?

231
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:58,570
Smooth jazz is good.

232
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:00,872
Not what I
would've guessed.

233
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:02,740
Nikki:
My life's hectic enough.

234
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:04,709
I don't need
my music to be.

235
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:07,879
<i>(Jazz music playing)</i>

236
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:14,118
(car horn beeps)

237
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,321
You realize,
we're still late.

238
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:19,858
Yeah... I got a ticket
going through a yellow.

239
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,594
So now I just stop.

240
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:36,040
So about this client,
I've been with him before.

241
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,876
He's a doctor.
Pretty basic.

242
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:39,177
Just walk me to the door,

243
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:41,613
and let him know you'll be
outside in the car.

244
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:44,983
I thought the job was just dropping off and picking up?

245
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:46,718
"The job" is being
my driver.

246
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,587
That's a ride
and protection.

247
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:51,823
You carry a weapon?

248
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:55,593
Me? A weapon?
No, I do not carry a weapon.

249
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:56,995
What about karate?
You know karate?

250
00:14:56,997 --> 00:15:00,164
I have zero skills
in the lethal arts.

251
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:03,067
I'm an architect.
I know how to draw.

252
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:06,304
Never mind, I got my own
protection right here.

253
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:12,510
Great. I'll let you handle
that part of the operation.

254
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:14,178
And what about you?

255
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:18,082
How did you get into this line of work?

256
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:22,153
Well, it's not exactly
an everyday job.

257
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:24,822
Well, that depends where
you spend every day.

258
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:26,157
I grew up
in the Valley.

259
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,859
Every girl I know
did a porno

260
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:28,960
by the time
she was eighteen.

261
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:30,695
Or at least
a stripping gig.

262
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:32,263
But you're still doing it.

263
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,998
Nikki: Yeah,
'cause I'm good at it.

264
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,867
I don't get
what the big deal is.

265
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:39,337
Nobody asks a carpenter
why they became a carpenter.

266
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,308
Fair enough.

267
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:15,139
(Knocking)

268
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,783
Hello, stranger.

269
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:28,019
It's been too long.

270
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:31,289
My driver.
Great house.

271
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,457
Paul Williams?

272
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:34,125
Paul Williams, right?

273
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:37,362
He's a pioneer of the California Regency Movement.

274
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:39,197
Really great designer.

275
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,898
Designed a lot
in the fifties,

276
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,367
which is when it looks this house is from.

277
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:44,135
He's black, incidentally,
which doesn't really--

278
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:47,405
I'm sorry.
Do I care about anything you're saying right now?

279
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:49,107
Nikki:
No, you don't.

280
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:51,242
Don't you have
somewhere to go?

281
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:52,777
Yes. He does.

282
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:54,278
He'll be in the car.
Right, Guy?

283
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,849
Right, of course.
I'll be in the car.

284
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:00,585
Nikki:
See you in an hour.

285
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:11,129

286
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:22,640
(music continues)

287
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:29,113
Fuck this.

<i>Baby?</i>

290

So guess what?

291

<i>I'm not driving pizzas.</i>

292
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:46,197
What are you driving?

293
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:48,666
Guy: Hookers.
Anne: <i>Shut up.</i>

294
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:50,201
I'm serious.

<i>I picked up this lady</i>
<i>called Nikki Winters.</i>

<i>You know that's not</i>
<i>her real name, right?</i>

298
00:17:57,277 --> 00:18:00,311
No way.
<i>Oh my, God. What was she like?</i>

299
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:02,713
Was she hot?
Did she have an amazing body?

300
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:05,316
<i>Did she look like Julia Roberts in "Pretty Woman"?</i>

301
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:08,386
No. This was not
a happy hooker.

302
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:10,054
This lady was mean.

303
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:12,857
Mean?
Can you blame her?

304
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:16,027
I guess not.
<i>So where is she now?</i>

305
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:17,862
At some doctor's house.

306
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:20,498
<i>And you're just like sitting out</i>
<i>in the driveway or something?</i>

307
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,100

<i>you left?</i>

You just ditched her?

310
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:28,473
Babe, this guy,
he totally insulted me.

311
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:30,308
I told him his house
was a Paul Williams,

312
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,477
and he looked at me
like I was an idiot.

313

<i>I mean, hello,</i>
<i>I have a master's in architecture from Yale,</i>

<i>was he creepy?</i>

317
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:46,557
He hired a hooker to come to
his mansion in the daytime.

318
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,825
Of course he was creepy.

319
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:49,260
Plus, he's like a doctor.

320
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:51,963
They're the worst
kind of psychos.

321
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,465

I'm sure it's fine.

She's in a house

337
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:25,990
Said she'd be out
twenty minutes ago,

338

<i>but she's not.</i>

Damn, that's all I need

She's, like, fifty percent

I lose her, then I'm out
on the street.

Spoken like a true pimp.
<i>Spoken like a true white boy.</i>

There are no more pimps.

523

Guy: <i>Hon.</i>
Baby, why you call me?

524
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:53,991
What happened with the lady and the doctor?

525
00:29:53,993 --> 00:29:55,893
Guy: <i>No, she's...</i>
<i>She's fine.</i>

526
00:29:55,895 --> 00:30:00,364
I picked her up and now we're
at this house in the Valley

527
00:30:00,366 --> 00:30:01,899
<i>with two other girls--</i>

528
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:04,268
Wait.
Two other hookers?

529
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:06,170
Looks that way, yeah.

530
00:30:06,172 --> 00:30:09,206
Anne: <i>So you're</i>

531
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:10,774
Yes.
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

532
00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:14,511
It's just you,
and three hookers,

533
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:16,480
<i>at a house in the Valley?</i>

534
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:20,017
Uh... yeah,
but I'm about to drive them

535
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:22,986
to a party,
where there'll be a bunch of guys.

536
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:26,857
Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

537
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:28,358
Guy: <i>What do you want</i>
<i>me to say?</i>

538
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,893
<i>I mean, you're the reason</i>
<i>I'm here at all.</i>

539
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:31,929
<i>Remember,</i>
<i>"somebody's daughter?"</i>

540
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:33,463
Yeah, well it seems

541
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:34,998
safe and sound now.

542
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,900
A few hours ago,
you wanted me to do anything

543
00:30:36,902 --> 00:30:38,235
to keep our insurance!

544
00:30:38,237 --> 00:30:39,903
<i>Yeah, well baby,</i>

Yeah, that's not quite what's

<i>Okay. All right.</i>

553
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,354
Babe. I have to go,
okay?

554
00:30:57,356 --> 00:31:00,557
I gotta clean
the hardware.

555

<i>I'll talk to you</i>

Hardware?

558
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:16,206
Okay.
Good to go.

559
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,808
You missed a spot.

560
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:20,777
What, I scrubbed
with antibacterial.

561
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:24,081
On your face.

562
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:25,716
Oh, God.

563
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:29,219
Ugh, get it off.
Is there...? Can I...?

564
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:33,223
Come here. Don't be such a wuss.
It's just lube.

565

Eww.

566

Okay, let's go.

Fallon: No, bitch, I got shotgun.

569
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,200

Jaxi: Nuh-uh,
put that shit away.

575
00:32:30,516 --> 00:32:31,782
What is your problem?

576
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:32,883
I'm not doin'
another party

577
00:32:32,885 --> 00:32:34,551

poppin' those.

578
00:32:34,553 --> 00:32:36,119
And why the hell not?

00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:38,455
Last time you ate my pussy,
you had one in your mouth,

580
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:40,590
I was numb for a week.

581
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:42,059
Numb, but minty fresh.

582
00:32:42,061 --> 00:32:44,361
Bitch. I am always minty fresh.
I'd like you fucking--

583
00:32:44,363 --> 00:32:47,698
Hey, our driver doesn't want to hear your gory details.

584
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,766
Oh, no,
don't mind me.

585
00:32:49,768 --> 00:32:52,069
Fallon:
We won't.

586
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:58,075
Uh, that's...

587
00:32:58,077 --> 00:33:00,577
that's an open container
right there.

588
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:02,079
Yeah, sure is.

589
00:33:02,081 --> 00:33:04,681
How else do you
get the liquid out, huh?

590
00:33:04,683 --> 00:33:06,350
Yeah, well...

591
00:33:06,352 --> 00:33:08,552
I don't really think
that's a good idea

592
00:33:08,554 --> 00:33:09,820
to have in the car.

593
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:13,123
Right?
I mean, lots of cops.

594
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:15,325
(Fallon giggling)
What's with this guy?

595
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:17,995
Tell me he's not for real?
Please tell me.

596
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:19,629
I'm sorry, but...

597
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:22,733
do you want us to buckle our seat
belts back here too, grandpa?

598
00:33:22,735 --> 00:33:23,834
'Cause we can.

599
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:25,802
You know what?
Go easy on him.

600
00:33:25,804 --> 00:33:29,740
He's sensitive... I mean,
being a gay and all.

601
00:33:29,742 --> 00:33:31,708
Oh, you like boys?

602
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:34,144
Oh my God,
that's so cute!

603
00:33:34,146 --> 00:33:35,979
We never had
a homo driver before.

604
00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:39,750
No wonder he took so long
washing the dildos.

605
00:33:39,752 --> 00:33:42,786
Ooh, ain't she
got your number!

606
00:33:42,788 --> 00:33:44,421

607
00:33:44,423 --> 00:33:47,391

I went all out and got them custom hats and everything.

We can discuss that I'm sure.

Awesome.

Wow! That is like

644
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:58,655
You heard I made partner

646
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:03,326

Just keep makin' 'em thinner.

Jaxi:
That never used to happen.

660
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:42,399
Now it's like I can't even
go to a grocery store

661

"Weren't you
in such and such?"

663
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:48,004
Used to be if you took
a really nasty job--

664
00:36:48,006 --> 00:36:49,739
Like when you did
<i>Black Cock Down?</i>

665

Fallon: And you did
<i>Weapons of Ass Destruction?</i>

666
00:36:53,111 --> 00:36:54,778
You know, the only way
someone would see it

667
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,080
was if they went to an equally nasty video store,

668
00:36:57,082 --> 00:36:58,515
paid actual money,

669
00:36:58,517 --> 00:37:00,283
<i>watched it in a VCR,</i>
<i>returned it</i>

670
00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:01,551
<i>and never gave it</i>
<i>another thought.</i>

671
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,453
Not only is everything
fucking free now,

672
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:06,156
They watch it over
and over and over.

You ready for your fifteen minutes,
Big Daddy?

676
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:15,398
Uh...
I'm not sure I follow.

677
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,901
They think
you're a pimp, right?

678
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:21,438
I thought there were no more
pimps because of Craigslist?

679
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,774
There aren't.
But those fools out there don't know that.

680
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:25,976
So run with it.

681
00:37:25,978 --> 00:37:27,410
Act like
you're Willie Dynamite,

682
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:28,945
been beating chicks
down for years.

683
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:31,448
That way they feel sorry
for us and they tip harder.

684
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:33,883
How many ones
you got?

685
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:35,352
A hundred.

686
00:37:35,354 --> 00:37:36,886
Here's what
we're gonna do.

687
00:37:36,888 --> 00:37:38,955
Sell 'em, collect 'em again,
sell 'em again.

688
00:37:38,957 --> 00:37:40,957
If they're not sticky
by night's end,

689
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:42,759
you didn't turn
'em around enough.

690
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:45,228
And collect the panties,
'cause they'll steal 'em and that shit's costly.

691
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:49,532
Amen. The most important thing,
learn your script.

692
00:37:51,036 --> 00:37:52,669
What, I have
to read this?

693
00:37:52,671 --> 00:37:55,772
Nikki: <i>You have to perform it.</i>
<i>You're a pimp, remember?</i>

694
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,742
You gotta bring out
that big boss, Mac Daddy,

695
00:37:58,744 --> 00:38:00,844
fur-coat-wearin'
motherfucker

696
00:38:00,846 --> 00:38:02,379
that I know is in you.

697
00:38:02,381 --> 00:38:03,880
Jaxi:
Bring it out, boo-boo.

698
00:38:03,882 --> 00:38:05,382
Okay, no.

699
00:38:05,384 --> 00:38:06,583
Fallon: What?
Jaxi: No?

700
00:38:06,585 --> 00:38:07,584
Guy: No, no, no, no,

701
00:38:07,586 --> 00:38:09,252
I...

702
00:38:09,254 --> 00:38:10,253
I can't do this.

703
00:38:10,255 --> 00:38:11,688
Fallon:
Are you kidding?

704
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,456
I can't do this.

705
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:16,993
There are people
out there that I...

706
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:18,628
I'm sorry.

707
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,998
I thought I was gonna be delivering pizzas tonight.

708
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,533
Honestly.

709
00:38:23,535 --> 00:38:25,735
I'm in way over
my head here.

710
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:28,071
I... I...

711
00:38:28,073 --> 00:38:31,775
This...

712
00:38:31,777 --> 00:38:34,044
I understand, Guy.

713
00:38:34,046 --> 00:38:35,779
What?

714
00:38:37,049 --> 00:38:40,650
You do?
Yeah, 'cause it's...

715
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:43,620
Thank you.
We get it.

716
00:38:43,622 --> 00:38:45,155
Thank you.

717
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:48,358
Because this...
is just not me.

718
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:52,028
But, I'll pay for your cab,
it's only fair.

719
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,596
Nikki:
We got it, Guy.

720
00:38:53,598 --> 00:38:56,599
One thing, though.
You got a long drive.

721
00:38:56,601 --> 00:38:59,903
Might wanna visit the little boys room, first.

722
00:38:59,905 --> 00:39:02,572
Smart thinking.

723
00:39:02,574 --> 00:39:05,575
I do kind of have to go.
So, excuse me.

724
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:09,679
Mm mm mm.

725
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:13,216
Who said,
"Don't break a guy in on a Saturday night?"

726
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:14,517
Who said it?

727
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,953
Get your gear on
and shut your faces.

728
00:39:22,461 --> 00:39:25,795
Oh, sorry,
it's all yours.

729
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:30,133
I'm not here
for the bathroom.

730
00:39:30,135 --> 00:39:34,137
So, you goin' home
to your boyfriend?

731
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:35,505
Huh?

732
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:37,607
You're still gay, right?

733
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:41,911
Oh, yeah.
I'm gay. See?

734
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:44,881
Pink shirt. I'm gay.

735
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:47,817
So...

736
00:39:49,121 --> 00:39:53,022
you don't like it
when I do this?

737
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:56,126
Um... not really.

738
00:39:57,462 --> 00:39:59,462
Or this...?
(Zipper zips)

739
00:40:01,032 --> 00:40:02,732
No.

740
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:07,837
Or this?

741
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,038
Umm...

742
00:40:11,042 --> 00:40:12,675
(camera clicks)

743
00:40:12,677 --> 00:40:15,445
Homos don't pop boners
when girls touch them.

744
00:40:15,447 --> 00:40:18,014
You know who does?
Husbands.

745
00:40:19,684 --> 00:40:22,185
Look, can I have
my phone, please?

746
00:40:22,187 --> 00:40:25,288
Is this
your "boyfriend"?

747
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:28,158
That's Anne.
That is my wife.

748
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,694
I wonder what Anne
would think of this?

749
00:40:31,696 --> 00:40:36,433
Let's see, contacts.
Anne Carter.

750
00:40:36,435 --> 00:40:38,168
"Attaching file"...

751
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:40,270
Okay, Nikki...
Nikki...

752
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:42,472
Please... please.

753
00:40:42,474 --> 00:40:45,008
She's 37 weeks pregnant.

754
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,643
She's very
fragile right now.

755
00:40:46,645 --> 00:40:49,512
She will not understand this,
not in a million years.

756
00:40:49,514 --> 00:40:51,648
I'm sure she wouldn't.
I wouldn't.

757
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:53,149
I mean, nobody likes
a cheater.

758
00:40:53,151 --> 00:40:56,920
Okay, please,
Anne will leave me.

759
00:40:56,922 --> 00:40:59,322
She will leave me,
okay?

760
00:40:59,324 --> 00:41:03,059
You don't understand
the stress we're under,

761
00:41:03,061 --> 00:41:04,227
both of us out of work.

762
00:41:04,229 --> 00:41:06,529
Oh, cry me a river,
Volvo Guy.

763
00:41:06,531 --> 00:41:07,931
Yeah, things sound
really desperate,

764
00:41:07,933 --> 00:41:10,200
with you turning your back
on an easy grand.

765
00:41:10,202 --> 00:41:13,169
I... I told you,

766
00:41:13,171 --> 00:41:15,472
I can't do this job.

767
00:41:15,474 --> 00:41:18,374
It's too much for me.

768
00:41:18,376 --> 00:41:21,411
Everything's just...

769
00:41:21,413 --> 00:41:26,382
It's too much for me.

770
00:41:26,384 --> 00:41:28,785
I got two words
for you, mister:

771
00:41:28,787 --> 00:41:31,554
Buck the hell up.

772
00:41:31,556 --> 00:41:33,756
Now, I'm gonna
keep hold of this.

773
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:35,458
And you're gonna
learn these...

774
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,993
and get
your non-gay-ass

775
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:39,295
into that room and you're gonna do your job.

776
00:41:39,297 --> 00:41:40,697
Okay?

777
00:41:50,642 --> 00:41:53,209
He was un-cool with it.
Now he's cool with it.

778
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:56,546
Let's go, let's go.
Lets' go.

779
00:41:56,548 --> 00:42:00,183
(Chanting) Bring them out!
Bring them out!

780
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:02,485
Bring them out!
Bring them out!

781
00:42:02,487 --> 00:42:05,822
Bring them out!
(Crowd applauding)

782
00:42:09,995 --> 00:42:11,194
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

783
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:13,162
Guy: <i>All right. Shit.</i>

784
00:42:13,164 --> 00:42:14,330
Man: <i>That shirt is so pink.</i>

785
00:42:14,332 --> 00:42:17,066
Hi.
(Feedback squeals)

786
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:19,869
Hello. Hi.
Okay, okay.

787
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:22,338
Sit down.
Man: <i>Come on, get on with it.</i>

788
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,507
You want me to bring
the ladies out...

789
00:42:24,509 --> 00:42:27,076
we gotta learn
a few basic rules.

790
00:42:27,078 --> 00:42:28,778
(Booing)

791
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,613
Bullshit!

792
00:42:32,851 --> 00:42:36,586
First and foremost,
no kissing the ladies on the mouth.

793
00:42:36,588 --> 00:42:38,087
They don't like it.

794
00:42:38,089 --> 00:42:40,723
(Booing)

795
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,725
It's alright, it's...
Man: <i>Can I kiss you?</i>

796
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:46,296
That's what it says.
Second rule...

797
00:42:46,298 --> 00:42:47,697
Man:
<i>Take off your top!</i>

798
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:49,766
No fingers
in any holes.

799
00:42:49,768 --> 00:42:52,702
(Booing)

800
00:42:52,704 --> 00:42:53,937
That's a deal breaker.

801
00:42:53,939 --> 00:42:57,740
That also goes
for remote controls.

802
00:42:57,742 --> 00:43:02,045
Cheese doodles.
Action figures. Action figures?

803
00:43:02,047 --> 00:43:03,947
Man: <i>Is my dick an action figure?</i>

804
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:08,284
Anything other than a sanctioned toy goes in the holes,

805
00:43:08,286 --> 00:43:09,285
show's over.

806
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:12,422
(Booing)

807
00:43:12,424 --> 00:43:14,591
One last thing.

808
00:43:14,593 --> 00:43:17,160
You want a hot show,
you're gonna have to tip.

809
00:43:17,162 --> 00:43:18,695
Man:
I'll show you my tip.

810
00:43:18,697 --> 00:43:22,332
I'll be selling
ones all night, all right?

811
00:43:22,334 --> 00:43:24,400
So, anyone?

812
00:43:24,402 --> 00:43:28,237

Your chick just
lifted all my ones!

That's fuckin'
unacceptable.

835

What? Wait. Now?

00:47:03,822 --> 00:47:06,589
This is different.
I'm having a family crisis.

869
00:47:06,591 --> 00:47:09,258
Yeah, well, You leave,
I'm having a financial crisis, okay?

870
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,294
Party games are up next.
You really wanna miss all the fun?

871
00:47:11,296 --> 00:47:13,763
No, no,
but-- Yeah, we're gonna put licorice up our pussies,

872
00:47:13,765 --> 00:47:14,964
and they're gonna
eat it out.

873
00:47:14,966 --> 00:47:16,499
Then we pour tequila shots
in our pussies

874
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:17,900
and they drink it out.

875
00:47:17,902 --> 00:47:19,635
Oh, then we put whipped cream
in our pussies

876
00:47:19,637 --> 00:47:21,037
and they lick--

877
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:22,772
I get it, I get it.
Lots of stuff going into the...

878
00:47:22,774 --> 00:47:25,174
Fallon: <i>That's what we do.</i>
Guy: ...pussies.

879
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:26,843
Yeah, I need you here
to cut the deals,

880
00:47:26,845 --> 00:47:27,910
keep the supplies coming

881
00:47:27,912 --> 00:47:29,378
tequila, candy,
whipped cream...

882
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:32,548
Nikki,
my wife just called.

883
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,650
She's having the baby.

884
00:47:34,652 --> 00:47:37,320
Are you fucking with me?

885
00:47:37,322 --> 00:47:38,621
I wish I were.

886
00:47:38,623 --> 00:47:40,923
Fine.
Go have your damn infant.

887
00:47:40,925 --> 00:47:42,859
Just don't expect
to get paid.

888
00:47:42,861 --> 00:47:43,860
Jaxi: <i>'Cause you didn't do shit!</i>

889
00:47:43,862 --> 00:47:46,629
I don't.
It's... I don't.

890
00:47:46,631 --> 00:47:48,931
Bye, loser.

891
00:47:50,068 --> 00:47:52,034
Jaxi:
I thought he was gay.

892
00:48:10,255 --> 00:48:12,321
(Tires screeching)

893
00:48:16,995 --> 00:48:18,594
Sorry.

894
00:48:20,198 --> 00:48:22,265
Hi. Maternity?

895
00:48:25,103 --> 00:48:26,402
Sorry.

896
00:48:27,705 --> 00:48:30,172
Hi. What's happening?

897
00:48:30,174 --> 00:48:32,008
Baby,
this is Doctor Siegel.

898
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,609
This is my husband, Guy.

899
00:48:33,611 --> 00:48:35,978
Hi. Is it coming out?

900
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:38,614
Uh... It is,
but not today.

901
00:48:38,616 --> 00:48:41,183
He says
I'm not even dilated.

902
00:48:41,185 --> 00:48:43,185
But okay--
What about the pain?

903
00:48:43,187 --> 00:48:45,821
Well, your wife was
experiencing false labor.

904
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:48,257
Which is not uncommon
during the first pregnancy.

905
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:49,759
Could be brought on
by anything really.

906
00:48:49,761 --> 00:48:51,460
Dehydration, stress...

907
00:48:51,462 --> 00:48:54,664
We started a saline drip just
to kind of settle things down.

908
00:48:54,666 --> 00:48:56,666
I'm already
feeling better.

909
00:48:56,668 --> 00:48:59,235
Oh, thank God.

910
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:05,775
Oh, thank God.
I cannot have this kid yet.

911
00:49:05,777 --> 00:49:08,044
Well, she is coming out
sooner or later.

912
00:49:08,046 --> 00:49:09,879
I'm gonna go make a note
in your chart.

913
00:49:09,881 --> 00:49:11,647
I'll be back in a bit
to take that drip out.

914
00:49:11,649 --> 00:49:13,683
Anne:
<i>Thank you.</i>

915
00:49:17,355 --> 00:49:19,055
You know, it really hurts
my feelings

916
00:49:19,057 --> 00:49:20,990
when you say things
like that.

917
00:49:20,992 --> 00:49:22,358
Oh.

918
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:25,895
I don't mean to upset you.
I'm just...

919
00:49:25,897 --> 00:49:27,196
I'm just being honest.

920
00:49:27,198 --> 00:49:29,065
I'm not ready.

921
00:49:29,067 --> 00:49:32,935
<i>What if I just suck</i>
<i>at being a dad? Really.</i>

922
00:49:32,937 --> 00:49:35,871
What if I'm
a bad provider,

923
00:49:35,873 --> 00:49:38,207
financially and emotionally?

924
00:49:38,209 --> 00:49:39,875
I mean,
think about it, Annie.

925
00:49:39,877 --> 00:49:42,945
We are bringing
an actual human,

926
00:49:42,947 --> 00:49:46,515
a real human life
into this world.

927
00:49:46,517 --> 00:49:48,417
She's gonna be a person.

928
00:49:48,419 --> 00:49:52,288
And everything that
she is and is going to be

929
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:54,040
depends upon us.

930
00:49:54,041 --> 00:49:55,791
<i>What made us think</i>
<i>we could do that?</i>

931
00:49:55,793 --> 00:49:58,627
<i>What if we're not</i>
<i>up to the job?</i>

932
00:49:58,629 --> 00:50:02,198
I just spent two hours
with three women whose parents

933
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,967
clearly did something wrong
because there's no way

934
00:50:04,969 --> 00:50:07,069
a well-adjusted person

935
00:50:07,071 --> 00:50:09,071
would stick licorice rope
up their-

936
00:50:09,073 --> 00:50:11,340
Licorice rope?
I love Licorice rope.

937
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:15,911
Yeah, me too.
I was just saying how I wish I had some.

938
00:50:15,913 --> 00:50:18,347
Can't help ya there,
but you're lucky

939
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,049
you got a doctor
with a sweet tooth.

940
00:50:20,051 --> 00:50:22,418
Would you care
for a Fruit Burst?

941
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:24,587
No, thank you.

942
00:50:25,823 --> 00:50:27,757
Baby, what if you're
right?

943
00:50:27,759 --> 00:50:29,959
What if she hates us?

944
00:50:29,961 --> 00:50:32,294
Why wouldn't she?
I hate my parents.

945
00:50:32,296 --> 00:50:34,163
You do not hate
your parents.

946
00:50:34,165 --> 00:50:37,833
Well, I do. I mean,
I don't totally love my parents.

947
00:50:37,835 --> 00:50:40,636
I wouldn't choose
to hang out with them.

948
00:50:40,638 --> 00:50:42,004
What if she feels
about me

949
00:50:42,006 --> 00:50:44,340
the way that I feel
about my mom?

950
00:50:44,342 --> 00:50:46,042
Oh, my God.

951
00:50:46,044 --> 00:50:48,044
I'd kill myself.

952
00:50:48,046 --> 00:50:50,046
Sign here, and here...

953
00:50:50,048 --> 00:50:51,947
Pay that much now,

954
00:50:51,949 --> 00:50:54,583
and then mail this form
into the insurance

955
00:50:54,585 --> 00:50:56,152
to get
your reimbursement.

956
00:50:56,154 --> 00:50:59,188
If we still have
insurance by then.

957
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:00,456
Man.

958
00:51:00,458 --> 00:51:04,427
That's about how much
Nikki said I'd make tonight.

959
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:06,228
What, the hookers?

960
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:10,199
Yeah, there was a lotta money
flying around.

961
00:51:10,201 --> 00:51:14,904
But I'm done.
Thank you.

962
00:51:14,906 --> 00:51:17,907
Come on. Let's get you
home and into bed.

963
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:20,109
You should probably
come with me.

964
00:51:20,111 --> 00:51:23,012
No, I don't want to leave my car here.
I'll drive.

965
00:51:23,014 --> 00:51:24,013
Are you sure?
I'll meet you there.

966
00:51:24,015 --> 00:51:25,681
You sure? You sure?

967
00:51:25,683 --> 00:51:26,749
I love you.
I love you.

968
00:51:26,751 --> 00:51:29,385
All right,
I'll meet you at home.

969
00:51:34,392 --> 00:51:36,926
Ma'am, is there a water fountain around here?

970
00:51:36,928 --> 00:51:38,627
Right around the corner
to the right.

971
00:51:38,629 --> 00:51:40,329
Thank you.

973
00:51:55,947 --> 00:51:57,379
You?

974
00:51:58,883 --> 00:52:00,616
You.

975
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:05,588
(Grunting)

976
00:52:12,163 --> 00:52:15,197
Orderly: Doctor?
Doctor Kurtz?

977
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:16,298
Yes.

978
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,868
Is he...?
Is that a patient?

979
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:22,771
Hey... Code Grey!
Code Grey!

980
00:52:22,773 --> 00:52:24,807
Oh shit.

986
00:53:16,327 --> 00:53:17,960
I just filled this syringe

987
00:53:17,962 --> 00:53:19,862
with 1.1 milliliters
of Anectine.

988
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:23,065
Enough to paralyze you
for several hours.

989
00:53:23,067 --> 00:53:26,535
It's a very disagreeable
experience.

990
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:30,406
Whatta you say
we go look up Nikki, huh?

991
00:53:30,408 --> 00:53:31,874
Okay.

992
00:53:31,876 --> 00:53:33,342
Come on.

00:53:38,349 --> 00:53:40,816
What are you planning
on doing to her?

995
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:44,553
I don't know yet.

996
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:47,556
You're really starting to sound like a creepy doctor,
you know that?

997
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:51,594
Yeah. You know what?
Just keep driving.

998
00:53:51,596 --> 00:53:53,963
What happened
wasn't her fault.

999
00:53:53,965 --> 00:53:55,698
It was mine.

1000
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,334
I'm new to this.
I thought she was being tortured.

1001
00:53:58,336 --> 00:53:59,768
I pay extra for that.

1002
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:01,337
I know that now,

1003
00:54:01,339 --> 00:54:03,305
but I think you can appreciate
the misunderstanding.

1004
00:54:03,307 --> 00:54:06,875
I mean, If you heard what I heard...
it sounded pretty extreme.

1005
00:54:08,913 --> 00:54:10,512
Obviously,
you have issues.

1006
00:54:10,514 --> 00:54:12,748
Maybe you should
consider therapy?

1007
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:15,584
Or you might want to rethink
the missionary position.

1008
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:17,019
It still works.

1009
00:54:17,021 --> 00:54:19,188
Rather well,
as a matter of fact.

1010
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:21,790
And it leaves s lot
less room for confusion.

1011
00:54:21,792 --> 00:54:23,859
Shut the fuck up.

1012
00:54:26,097 --> 00:54:29,031
I don't think you realize
how lucky you are.

1013
00:54:29,033 --> 00:54:30,466
You're a doctor.

1014
00:54:30,468 --> 00:54:32,935
You're getting to do,
what I imagine,

1015
00:54:32,937 --> 00:54:33,936
you've always wanted
to do--

1016
00:54:33,938 --> 00:54:35,237
and getting
paid for it.

1017
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:36,672
Do you know
how rare that is?

1018
00:54:36,674 --> 00:54:38,240
Most people work
their whole lives

1019
00:54:38,242 --> 00:54:39,908
and never get
that chance.

1020
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:41,277
You go in there
half-cocked,

1021
00:54:41,279 --> 00:54:42,911
you're throwing it
all away.

1022
00:54:42,913 --> 00:54:44,947
Your medical license?
Gone.

1023
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:46,982

00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:53,522
Another thing, doctor,
I Googled your house.

1026
00:54:53,524 --> 00:54:55,624
It is a Paul Williams.
1953.

1027
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:59,428
Preservation boards
go crazy for him

1028
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:01,497
because he was black,
working in an all-white hierarchy.

1029
00:55:01,499 --> 00:55:03,565
Guy: You could get
landmark status.

1030
00:55:03,567 --> 00:55:05,334
Are you
fucking kidding me?

1031
00:55:05,336 --> 00:55:08,003
Guy:
Nikki. Shit.

1032
00:55:08,005 --> 00:55:10,105
Guy: Nikki, don't move.

1033
00:55:10,107 --> 00:55:12,841
Doctor, please don't.

1034
00:55:12,843 --> 00:55:16,412
Listen to me, think about it.
Think about all of it.

1035
00:55:16,414 --> 00:55:17,813
You get landmark status.

1036
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:23,018
Which, on your house,
means no property taxes!

1037
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,187
That's huge
cash savings.

1038

you bring him here?

00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,767
What? I...

1043
00:55:38,769 --> 00:55:40,202
Did you not just see...?

1044
00:55:40,204 --> 00:55:42,137
He kidnapped me!

1045
00:55:42,139 --> 00:55:46,675
Dr. Fucking Strangelove
works at our hospital.

1046
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:49,511
He was hell bent on getting revenge or something.

1047
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:51,213
Nikki: <i>I guess he's</i>
<i>shit outta luck.</i>

1048
00:55:51,215 --> 00:55:53,048
Guy:
Yeah, it looks that way.

1049
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:55,184
I hope to fuck
he's not dead.

1050
00:55:55,186 --> 00:55:57,920
No, he's just paralyzed
for a couple of hours.

1051
00:55:57,922 --> 00:56:00,989
It's a...

1052
00:56:00,991 --> 00:56:03,459
Thing. It's a neck...
Whatever.

1053
00:56:03,461 --> 00:56:06,161
Awesome. So what's
the deal with your baby?

1054
00:56:06,163 --> 00:56:08,197
False alarm.

1055
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:11,734
Well, since you're here,
want your old job back?

1056
00:56:16,273 --> 00:56:19,608
Come on, doc.
I got you.

1057
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:24,179
Look what the cat
dragged in.

1058
00:56:24,181 --> 00:56:26,648
Hey! Now the party's
gonna get really crazy!

1059
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:30,052
Pull up a bottle, "driver."
We're in the home stretch.

1060
00:56:31,622 --> 00:56:34,590
Hey, can you
hook that for me, Love?

1061
00:56:34,592 --> 00:56:37,025
Oh, yeah.

1062
00:56:37,027 --> 00:56:39,461
That's not one of the regular Kiss guys,
is it?

1063
00:56:39,463 --> 00:56:42,331
No, it's Eric Carr.
He's the best.

1064
00:56:42,333 --> 00:56:44,466
He replaced Peter Criss
on the drums.

1065
00:56:44,468 --> 00:56:47,102
Guy: <i>Good to know.</i>
Yeah, he's a fox.

1066
00:56:47,104 --> 00:56:49,538
How can you tell?
He's got paint all over his face.

1067
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:51,240
No, I mean, literally.

1068
00:56:51,242 --> 00:56:53,909
He's a fox, like,
that's his character.

1069
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:55,411
Her mom
slept with him once.

1070
00:56:55,413 --> 00:56:57,346
That's Fallon's
big claim to fame,

1071
00:56:57,348 --> 00:56:59,748
she could have been
the Kiss drummer's daughter.

1072
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:03,085
Nikki: Okay, this is it.
The big finale.

1073
00:57:03,087 --> 00:57:06,789
We're lookin' to get five bills.
It's up to you.

1074
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:10,993
At this point,
there's pretty much nothing that'll shock me.

1075
00:57:10,995 --> 00:57:12,795
Except this.

1076
00:57:12,797 --> 00:57:16,698
We're looking to get every single mother fuckin' dollar.

1077
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:19,835
Fallon: Yeah.
Work it down to the bone.

1078
00:57:19,837 --> 00:57:21,637
(Shouting)

1079
00:57:21,639 --> 00:57:23,539
I'm ticklish.
Balls out.

1080
00:57:24,408 --> 00:57:25,941
Man:
This guy?

1081
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:28,310
All right, everybody.

1082
00:57:28,312 --> 00:57:30,078
Guy:
Alright, alright.

1083
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,648
(Crowd jeering)

1084
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:36,418
Listen, this is the moment
you've all been waiting for.

1085
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:38,454
(Crowd cheering)

1086
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:44,026
It's time
for the girl-on-girl...

1087
00:57:44,028 --> 00:57:48,263
on-girl sex show.

1088
00:57:48,265 --> 00:57:49,398
Now, now listen,

1089
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:53,669
this is one hot, sick show.

1090
00:57:53,671 --> 00:57:57,539
Everything you see
is real.

1091
00:57:57,541 --> 00:58:00,409
I'm serious. Everything.
One hundred percent.

1092
00:58:00,411 --> 00:58:02,711
None of it is fake.
Listen, listen...

1093
00:58:02,713 --> 00:58:05,581
(crowd shouting)

1094
00:58:05,583 --> 00:58:08,517
All right, all right.
Stop it!

1095
00:58:08,519 --> 00:58:10,752
Guy: You want proof?
Man: <i>Bullshit!</i>

1096
00:58:10,754 --> 00:58:14,523
Our girl Fallon,
she's gonna prove it.

1097
00:58:14,525 --> 00:58:18,427
There's no way to fake
what she's about to do.

1098
00:58:18,429 --> 00:58:21,763
Guy:
Okay, it is the real deal.

1099
00:58:21,765 --> 00:58:25,133
Now I don't wanna ruin
the surprise

1100
00:58:25,135 --> 00:58:27,669
but suffice to say,

1101
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:30,739
you might not
wanna sit too close.

1102
00:58:30,741 --> 00:58:34,576
(Crowd gasps)

1103
00:58:34,578 --> 00:58:36,979
I need to see the money.
Help me out.

1104
00:58:36,981 --> 00:58:39,581
'Cause I can't-- We can't go forward without the money!

1105
00:58:39,583 --> 00:58:42,117
So what do you say?
How about some money?

1106
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:46,421
(Crowd cheering)

1107
00:58:46,423 --> 00:58:47,956
You guys are very smart.

1108
00:58:47,958 --> 00:58:49,458
'Cause you just bought
yourself a memory

1109
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:53,795
that you will
never ever forget. Boom.

1110
00:58:53,797 --> 00:58:56,164
<i>(Music playing)</i>

1111
00:58:56,166 --> 00:58:58,367
(cheering)

1112
00:58:58,369 --> 00:59:00,669
What I tell you?

1113
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:04,740
Woo!

1114
01:00:05,869 --> 01:00:08,704
(Phone ringing)

1115
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:15,344
Anne: <i>Where'd you go?</i>
<i>I thought you were right behind me?</i>

1116
01:00:15,346 --> 01:00:17,813
Guy: I got sidelined.
Anne: <i>By what?</i>

1117
01:00:17,815 --> 01:00:19,781
It's a long story,
try not to be mad,

1118
01:00:19,783 --> 01:00:22,651
but, I'm back at the hotel.

1119
01:00:22,653 --> 01:00:24,753
Now you've got me
thinking about this baby.

1120
01:00:24,755 --> 01:00:27,589
What if I hate her?
What if she's ugly?

1121
01:00:27,591 --> 01:00:30,258
What if she has one of those giant raspberry birthmarks

1122
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,027
on her face and I can't
bond with her

1123
01:00:32,029 --> 01:00:33,795
because I can't
even look at her?

1124
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:35,430
<i>What if I hate her</i>
<i>because she's beautiful,</i>

1125
01:00:35,432 --> 01:00:37,566
more beautiful than I am?

1126
01:00:37,568 --> 01:00:40,002
And I get super jealous
of her and resentful

1127
01:00:40,004 --> 01:00:42,471
<i>and competitive because</i>
<i>she has six pack abs...</i>

1128
01:00:42,473 --> 01:00:43,972
Nikki:
<i>Guy, come on.</i>

1129
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:45,774
While I bust my ass
at CrossFit every week

1130
01:00:45,776 --> 01:00:47,843
and still have this weird
an inner tube around my waist?

1131
01:00:47,845 --> 01:00:52,314
Oh, my God, Guy,
I feel the postpartum already setting in.

1132
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:54,082
<i>Does California have a law</i>

1133
01:00:54,084 --> 01:00:55,684
<i>where you can drop off</i>
<i>a baby at a fire station--</i>

1134
01:00:55,686 --> 01:00:58,820
Babe, babe, babe, babe.
You're spinning.

1135
01:00:58,822 --> 01:01:01,490
I know! That's why I need
you to come home right now!

1136
01:01:01,492 --> 01:01:04,760
The party isn't over yet.

1137
01:01:04,762 --> 01:01:07,229
We need to clean up
and get these girls home.

1138
01:01:07,231 --> 01:01:09,264
<i>Look, just try to relax.</i>

1139
01:01:09,266 --> 01:01:14,002
Try to lay down.
Lay down and make some chamomile tea.

1140
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:15,170
Guy: <i>Just calm--</i>

1141
01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:17,005
Anne: I can't calm down!

1142
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:19,074
You know why,
because I don't have a "me"

1143
01:01:19,076 --> 01:01:21,643
to calm me down
like I do for you!

1144
01:01:21,645 --> 01:01:23,712
The one time
I need a "me,"

1145
01:01:23,714 --> 01:01:24,980
<i>you're not here!</i>
<i>(Phone clicks)</i>

1146
01:01:24,982 --> 01:01:27,816
<i>(Fallon moaning)</i>
Babe? Babe?

1147
01:01:29,253 --> 01:01:32,921
(Moaning)

1148
01:01:37,227 --> 01:01:41,396
(moaning continues)

1149
01:01:44,702 --> 01:01:45,767
Fallon:
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

1150
01:01:45,769 --> 01:01:48,770
(Crowd chanting)
<i>Go! Go! Go!</i>

1151
01:01:53,077 --> 01:01:56,144
Crowd:
Oh!

1152
01:01:57,247 --> 01:01:59,981
Oh, my God!
That's so wrong!

01:02:05,556 --> 01:02:09,091
<i>(Men chattering)</i>

1154
01:02:10,728 --> 01:02:13,128
Go clean yourself up.

1155
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:14,796
What is that stuff?

1156
01:02:14,798 --> 01:02:17,766
Nobody knows.
But you should clean it off.

1157
01:02:18,569 --> 01:02:20,335
(Chuckles)

1158
01:02:20,337 --> 01:02:23,238
I think I'm in love.

1159
01:02:37,387 --> 01:02:39,354
Oh, shit.

1160
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:55,237
We got robbed.

1161
01:02:55,239 --> 01:02:57,272
Robbed?

1162
01:02:57,274 --> 01:02:58,406
As in, someone came in here

1163
01:02:58,408 --> 01:03:00,208
and snaked all our cash.

1164
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:01,843
Wait, are you sure?

1165
01:03:01,845 --> 01:03:05,413
This was full.
Now it's not.

1166
01:03:05,415 --> 01:03:06,982
Who would do something
like that?

1167
01:03:06,984 --> 01:03:09,184
One of those
limp dick fuck boys.

1168
01:03:09,186 --> 01:03:10,852
You killed yourselves
for that money!

1169
01:03:10,854 --> 01:03:13,288
I wouldn't go
that far, but, yeah,

1170
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:14,623
it took some effort.

1171
01:03:14,625 --> 01:03:16,391
Hold on, wait.

1172
01:03:16,393 --> 01:03:20,061
Maybe-- Maybe-- Maybe it like just fell out or something.

1173
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:22,681
It didn't.

1174
01:03:22,682 --> 01:03:25,300
Well, we should at least have look around for it,
don't you think?

1175
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:29,704
I agree.
Let's look for it.

1176
01:03:29,706 --> 01:03:33,575
Fallon: Mother fuckers! Jaxi: Yeah,
somebody's about to get fucked up.

1177
01:03:33,577 --> 01:03:35,644
It's not under here.

1178
01:03:35,646 --> 01:03:37,279
Wait! Ladies.

1179
01:03:42,085 --> 01:03:43,752
Hey, party's
goin' great, man.

1180
01:03:43,754 --> 01:03:45,687
That show was a mind fuck.
Yeah, sure was.

1181
01:03:45,689 --> 01:03:48,690
We gotta talk about that thing we were talkin' about.
The extras?

1182
01:03:48,692 --> 01:03:51,159
Yeah, that's not
happening right now.

1183
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:52,561
What the fuck?

1184
01:03:52,563 --> 01:03:53,895
You said we'd get extras.

1185
01:03:53,897 --> 01:03:55,363
You gave me your word.

1186
01:03:55,365 --> 01:03:57,499
We got robbed,
motherfucker.

1187
01:03:57,501 --> 01:03:59,668
Either you make up
the difference

1188
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:01,636
or we don't let
anyone outta here.

1189
01:04:01,638 --> 01:04:02,871
You're high.

1190
01:04:02,873 --> 01:04:04,306
None of these guys
would rob you.

1191
01:04:04,308 --> 01:04:05,807
They're all agents.

1192
01:04:05,809 --> 01:04:08,276
Suit yourselves.

1193
01:04:08,278 --> 01:04:10,812
Ladies, lock the doors.

1194
01:04:10,814 --> 01:04:13,582
This is ridiculous.
I'm calling security.

1195
01:04:13,584 --> 01:04:14,749
No, you ain't.

1196
01:04:14,751 --> 01:04:16,551
Uh-oh.
Shit just got real.

1197
01:04:16,553 --> 01:04:18,753
Wha-- Nikki, whoa.
Nikki...

1198
01:04:18,755 --> 01:04:20,488
you never
mentioned guns.

1199
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:22,324
I thought we
were gonna talk.

1200
01:04:22,326 --> 01:04:23,925
We are gonna talk.

1201
01:04:23,927 --> 01:04:25,727
This helps them listen.

1202
01:04:25,729 --> 01:04:28,964
Okay, people.
We got a situation here.

1203
01:04:28,966 --> 01:04:31,800
One of you boners
stole my money.

1204
01:04:31,802 --> 01:04:34,636
Nobody is leaving
this fucking hotel

1205
01:04:34,638 --> 01:04:36,137
until I get it back.

1206
01:04:36,139 --> 01:04:40,442
I want all of you cunts
on the carpet.

1207
01:04:40,444 --> 01:04:42,110
Now!

1208
01:04:42,112 --> 01:04:46,147
Jaxi: <i>Yeah,
who's taking their dicks out now, bitch?</i>

1209
01:04:46,149 --> 01:04:48,149
He gets a pass.

1210
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:51,119
You can take whatever I got.

1211
01:04:51,121 --> 01:04:52,787
Take my wallet.
Take anything.

1212
01:04:52,789 --> 01:04:55,857
I don't want your wallet, prick.
I want my money.

1213
01:04:55,859 --> 01:04:57,259
The money I earned.

1214
01:04:57,261 --> 01:04:58,894
Fallon:
Yeah, the money we earned.

1215
01:04:58,896 --> 01:05:00,729
Nikki:
Guy, check 'em.

1216
01:05:00,731 --> 01:05:02,497
Check 'em.

1217
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:04,766
Aren't you two cozy.

1218
01:05:04,768 --> 01:05:06,918
Fucking guys spooning.

1219
01:05:06,919 --> 01:05:09,069
Jaxi: <i>This one's clean.</i>
Fallon: <i>This guy's clean.</i>

1220
01:05:13,443 --> 01:05:14,843
Clean. Move!

1221
01:05:14,845 --> 01:05:18,647
Guy: Clean here.
Fallon: Ooh, library card.

1222
01:05:18,649 --> 01:05:20,882
Guy: Clean.
Fallon: Munch some carpet!

1223
01:05:20,884 --> 01:05:23,685
I touched his penis.
Sorry. Clean.

1224
01:05:23,687 --> 01:05:26,121
Jaxi: <i>Clean.</i>
Nikki: <i>Check his pants.</i>

1225
01:05:27,057 --> 01:05:29,124
Help!
Congratulations, dude.

1226
01:05:29,126 --> 01:05:31,293
Man: Thank you.
Guy: Sorry. Clean.

1227
01:05:31,295 --> 01:05:33,061
What about him?

1228
01:05:33,063 --> 01:05:34,796
Hey, you don't
have to worry about me.

1229
01:05:34,798 --> 01:05:36,631
I mean,
you know I'm cool.

1230
01:05:36,633 --> 01:05:39,434
Jaxi: <i>Clean.</i>
Fallon: <i>Clean.</i>

1231
01:05:46,043 --> 01:05:48,610
Hey, man.
I got laid off six months ago.

1232
01:05:48,612 --> 01:05:51,346
I had to do it.
I'll split it with you.

1233
01:05:51,348 --> 01:05:53,815
Nikki: <i>I know one of you</i>
<i>boners stole this shit!</i>

1234
01:05:53,817 --> 01:05:56,985
Come on, man,
help out a bro.

1235
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:11,199
It's this one.
<i>(Roars)</i>

1236
01:06:11,201 --> 01:06:12,834
You dick!

1237
01:06:12,836 --> 01:06:15,537
We got a runner!
Get him!

1238
01:06:15,539 --> 01:06:17,138
(Screeches)

1239
01:06:21,545 --> 01:06:23,979
<i>(music playing)</i>

1240
01:06:23,981 --> 01:06:26,481
Fallon:
Go! Go! Go!

1241
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:28,750
Move your ass, Guy.

1242
01:06:28,752 --> 01:06:30,552
Jaxi:
Elevator's not coming, bitch!

1243
01:06:30,554 --> 01:06:33,021
Fallon:
Get over here, fucker!

1244
01:06:34,524 --> 01:06:37,058
Stop right there!

1245
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:38,493
Jaxi:
<i>Please jump.</i>

1246
01:06:38,495 --> 01:06:39,794
Hey...

1247
01:06:39,796 --> 01:06:41,062
Make my fucking night.

1248
01:06:41,064 --> 01:06:42,831
Oh, I was just messin'
with you guys.

1249
01:06:42,833 --> 01:06:45,233
I was totally
gonna give it back.

1250
01:06:46,737 --> 01:06:48,470
You idiot.

1251
01:06:51,608 --> 01:06:54,409
It's right here.
Every cent.

1252
01:06:54,411 --> 01:06:55,744
Frisk his ass.

1253
01:06:55,746 --> 01:06:57,779
That's just...
Hey.

1254
01:06:57,781 --> 01:06:59,781
Homeboy is
doughy as fuck.

1255
01:06:59,783 --> 01:07:01,750
Look here.
I forgot about that. Sorry.

1256
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:05,920
Okay, I told you,
I was gonna give it back.

1257
01:07:05,922 --> 01:07:07,155
I was just
bustin' your balls.

1258
01:07:07,157 --> 01:07:09,257
Turn around
and get on your knees.

1259
01:07:09,259 --> 01:07:12,394
What?
On your knees, fuck-tard!

1260
01:07:12,396 --> 01:07:14,262
Jaxi:
You like to play games, right?

1261
01:07:14,264 --> 01:07:16,631
What're you gonna do, Guy?
Someone's about to get fucked up.

1262
01:07:16,633 --> 01:07:18,767
Guy, buddy, please, please,
don't let them hurt me, please.

1263
01:07:18,769 --> 01:07:20,168
I'm so sorry!

1264
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:24,139
I'm so, so, so, so sorry!
Please...

1265
01:07:24,141 --> 01:07:25,807
Guy: Nikki, Nikki...
Hey, listen.

1266
01:07:25,809 --> 01:07:28,176
Ladies...
piss on this fucker.

1267
01:07:28,178 --> 01:07:30,278
Devon: What?
Fallon: Hell yeah!

1268
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:32,447
Nikki, hold on,
that's just plain gross.

1269
01:07:32,449 --> 01:07:37,085
You cannot pee-pee on me!
Guy, don't let them do this!

1270
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:39,421
Honey, my bladder's about to burst.
(Zipper scratches)

1271
01:07:39,423 --> 01:07:41,156
Nikki: Do you wanna
go first, or should I?

1272
01:07:41,158 --> 01:07:42,924
You filthy bitches!

1273
01:07:42,926 --> 01:07:46,361
No, don't don't don't!
Seriously, stop. Don't...

1274
01:07:46,363 --> 01:07:48,063
Yeah, pee on him.

1275
01:07:48,065 --> 01:07:50,632
Devon:
Oh God, stop. No!

1276
01:07:50,634 --> 01:07:52,400
Nikki:
Rainbow kiss!

1277
01:07:55,072 --> 01:07:58,206
(Devon groaning)

1278
01:07:58,208 --> 01:08:00,108
Devon:
It's in my mouth!

1279
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:02,410
Fallon, what the fuck
are you doing?

1280
01:08:02,412 --> 01:08:03,578
You said pee on him.

1281
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:05,580
He's blindfolded.

1282
01:08:05,582 --> 01:08:07,649
He can't tell
the difference!

1283
01:08:07,651 --> 01:08:09,050
Well,
I really had to go.

1284
01:08:09,052 --> 01:08:12,287
Devon:
You nasty, filthy bitches!

1285
01:08:12,289 --> 01:08:16,391
Wait. Why does she get
to pee on him and I don't?

1286
01:08:16,393 --> 01:08:18,760
Fallon: Give it back to me,
motherfucker!

1287
01:08:18,762 --> 01:08:19,961
Jaxi:
Bitch!

1288
01:08:19,963 --> 01:08:21,830
Jaxi:
Smells like asparagus.

1289
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,300
Hey, man.

1290
01:08:26,970 --> 01:08:30,505
Good thing she didn't
have to poop, huh?

1291
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:34,309
What?

1292
01:08:35,078 --> 01:08:37,812
(Sirens whirr)

1293
01:08:51,595 --> 01:08:53,495
Having fun yet?

1294
01:08:55,365 --> 01:08:58,700
Is this what every
Saturday night is like?

1295
01:08:58,702 --> 01:09:00,902
Pretty much.

1296
01:09:00,904 --> 01:09:02,804
How do you survive?

1297
01:09:05,175 --> 01:09:07,175
Smooth jazz helps.

1298
01:09:09,179 --> 01:09:11,946
I think I might need
something stronger.

1299
01:09:11,948 --> 01:09:14,382
Smooth metal.

1300
01:09:15,218 --> 01:09:17,952
Why are you
such a stress case?

1301
01:09:17,954 --> 01:09:21,322
Oh, I don't know.

1302
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:23,158
Because I'm about
to have a kid.

1303
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:25,560
I don't have a career.

1304
01:09:25,562 --> 01:09:28,096
Your kid doesn't
need you to have a career.

1305
01:09:28,098 --> 01:09:30,598
Really?
What does she need?

1306
01:09:32,002 --> 01:09:35,803
For you to basically do what
you've been doing tonight with us.

1307
01:09:35,805 --> 01:09:40,208
(Chuckles) Okay,
I think you and I have very different philosophies

1308
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:42,810
on how to raise kids.

1309
01:09:42,812 --> 01:09:44,212
I don't know.

1310
01:09:44,214 --> 01:09:47,582
No, I think it boils down
to a ride and protection.

1311
01:09:47,584 --> 01:09:49,918
Sure you can throw in
washing their stuff

1312
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,152
and picking up after them,

1313
01:09:51,154 --> 01:09:53,555
which, incidentally,
you also did tonight.

1314
01:09:53,557 --> 01:09:56,958
But mostly,

1315
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:59,527
kids just need a ride
and protection.

1316
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:02,630
It doesn't matter if you drive a Porsche or a Pontiac.

1317
01:10:02,632 --> 01:10:05,900
As long as the kid knows that
you're gonna be there on time

1318
01:10:05,902 --> 01:10:07,202
and they're
gonna be safe,

1319
01:10:07,204 --> 01:10:08,870
it's a job done.

1320
01:10:12,042 --> 01:10:14,909
We both know
you can do that.

1321
01:10:14,911 --> 01:10:18,713
You can do that
like a champ.

1322
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:20,848
Now, look...

1323
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:22,850
Now before we clear out
of the room,

1324
01:10:22,852 --> 01:10:25,553
do an idiot check.
Come on.

1325
01:10:39,169 --> 01:10:42,303
Hey, ladies, hold up.

1326
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:46,407
I've got
something of yours.

1327
01:10:46,409 --> 01:10:48,576
Oh my God,
these are my favorites.

1328
01:10:48,578 --> 01:10:50,812
Someone was supposed
to collect all the panties.

1329
01:10:50,814 --> 01:10:53,248
Man:
They were under the couch.

1330
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:57,151
I'm just glad I was able
to get 'em back to you.

1331
01:10:57,153 --> 01:10:58,920
Well, thanks.

1332
01:11:01,291 --> 01:11:04,826
Man: It really was
a dynamite show.

1333
01:11:04,828 --> 01:11:06,094
I'd also like to say

1334
01:11:06,096 --> 01:11:08,997
I'm sorry for what
happened back there.

1335
01:11:08,999 --> 01:11:10,131
Some guys...

1336
01:11:10,133 --> 01:11:11,232
they just don't
say a lot

1337
01:11:11,234 --> 01:11:14,035
for the male gender,
now do they?

1338
01:11:14,037 --> 01:11:16,137
Yeah, well, if it wasn't
for the male gender,

1339
01:11:16,139 --> 01:11:18,172
we wouldn't have jobs.

1340
01:11:18,174 --> 01:11:21,276
True, which leads me
to my next point.

1341
01:11:21,278 --> 01:11:22,910
Now, I know you said
you guys were done...

1342
01:11:22,912 --> 01:11:24,545
Here we go.

1343
01:11:24,547 --> 01:11:26,347
Dude, go home.

1344
01:11:26,349 --> 01:11:28,616
Bust a load off
in your sink.

1345
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:32,020
I got two hundies burnin'
a hole in my pocket.

1346
01:11:32,022 --> 01:11:33,888
My truck is
right in the corner,

1347
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:37,058
so, what do ya say?

1348
01:11:42,932 --> 01:11:45,233
What the hell.
Awesome.

1349
01:11:45,235 --> 01:11:49,070
This will just take
a few seconds, no offense.

1350
01:11:49,072 --> 01:11:50,371
Come on.

1351
01:11:50,373 --> 01:11:52,740
Some taken.
But... yeah. Shall we?

1352
01:11:56,046 --> 01:11:59,147
My cousin made over a million bucks selling vitamins.

1353
01:11:59,149 --> 01:12:00,548
Fallon:
Maybe coke vitamins.

1354
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:03,051
No, bitch.
Real fucking vitamins.

1355
01:12:03,053 --> 01:12:04,552
Nu-uh.
Yeah-huh.

1356
01:12:04,554 --> 01:12:06,854
Fallon: Okay, that was
so black-ish of you.

1357
01:12:06,856 --> 01:12:09,490
Jaxi: <i>Bitch, I am black.</i>
<i>Stop fucking playing with me like that, Fallon.</i>

1358
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:14,395
So is she gonna go all the way with that guy,
right over there?

1359
01:12:14,397 --> 01:12:16,764
Jaxi:
What're you, 12?

1360
01:12:16,766 --> 01:12:17,899
I'm just sayin'.

1361
01:12:17,901 --> 01:12:20,201
Oh, he's worried.

1362
01:12:20,203 --> 01:12:21,903
You worried
about her, pops?

1363
01:12:21,905 --> 01:12:25,973
Well, when you actually think about it,
it is worrisome.

1364
01:12:25,975 --> 01:12:28,209
Jaxi: <i>Okay, here's</i>
<i>what they don't teach you</i>

1365
01:12:28,211 --> 01:12:29,944
<i>when you buy a ticket</i>
<i>at the door.</i>

1366
01:12:29,946 --> 01:12:31,446
Pros, do the
absolute minimum.

1367
01:12:31,448 --> 01:12:33,981
That means, we dance
a little, talk dirty...

1368
01:12:33,983 --> 01:12:36,451
Finger ourselves.
Maybe a hand job.

1369
01:12:36,453 --> 01:12:39,654
If he can get it up, which,
more than likely, he can't.

1370
01:12:39,656 --> 01:12:42,957
Exactly.
These guys are so full of vodka and whatnot,

1371
01:12:42,959 --> 01:12:44,992
it's mostly babysitting.

1372
01:12:44,994 --> 01:12:47,095
That's why
they call it a trick.

1373
01:12:47,097 --> 01:12:50,331
Professionals,
rarely, if ever,

1374
01:12:50,333 --> 01:12:52,166
give up the cookie.

1375
01:12:52,168 --> 01:12:55,203
No fucking way. Oh, my God,
this cannot be fucking happening.

1376
01:12:55,205 --> 01:12:57,839
What's not happening?
Fallon: The guy from the party. He's busting Nikki!

1377
01:12:57,841 --> 01:13:00,108
He's a fucking cop,
we gotta get out of here.

1378
01:13:00,110 --> 01:13:01,309
Yeah, yeah.
Guy, drive!

1379
01:13:01,311 --> 01:13:02,677
What about Nikki?

1380
01:13:02,679 --> 01:13:04,145
Nikki's going to jail
right now,

1381
01:13:04,147 --> 01:13:05,713
which is not where
we're goin',

1382
01:13:05,715 --> 01:13:07,982
so you need to drive
this fucking car

1383
01:13:07,984 --> 01:13:09,417
before I do it for you.

1384
01:13:09,419 --> 01:13:11,552
We can't leave.
What 'cause of Nikki?

1385
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:15,022
Fucking drive the car!
Back the fuck up!

1386
01:13:15,024 --> 01:13:17,458
Fallon:
Let's go!

1387
01:13:19,329 --> 01:13:22,029
Jaxi: <i>What the fuck?</i>
Fallon: <i>What're you doin'?</i>

1388
01:13:22,031 --> 01:13:23,731
Fallon:
Come on, dude.

1389
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:25,432
Jaxi: <i>What the fuck?</i>
Fallon: <i>Why are you stopping?</i>

1390
01:13:25,435 --> 01:13:27,168
Jaxi: <i>What are you doing?</i>
Fallon: <i>Keep going!</i>

1391
01:13:27,170 --> 01:13:29,203
Jaxi: <i>Drive forward!</i>
<i>What the fuck?</i>

1392
01:13:29,205 --> 01:13:31,506
Fallon:
<i>Press the fucking pedal!</i>

1393
01:13:33,276 --> 01:13:35,476
(Tires screeching)

1394
01:13:35,478 --> 01:13:37,845
Man:
Whoa, hey!

1395
01:13:37,847 --> 01:13:38,946
Go! Go! Go!

1396
01:13:38,948 --> 01:13:40,248
(Screams)

1397
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:42,850
Hey!

1398
01:13:42,852 --> 01:13:45,720
(Screaming)

1399
01:13:47,991 --> 01:13:50,391
Fuck!
You did not just do that!

1400
01:13:50,393 --> 01:13:52,193
What the fuck,
Tokyo Drift?

1401
01:13:52,195 --> 01:13:53,761
I don't see 'em
in the back.

1402
01:13:53,763 --> 01:13:56,230
Jaxi: That's because
there's nobody behind us.

1403
01:13:56,232 --> 01:13:58,766
Tokyo Drift,
you did it!

1404
01:13:59,736 --> 01:14:02,303
(Crashes)

1405
01:14:02,305 --> 01:14:05,173
(all groaning)

1406
01:14:06,843 --> 01:14:08,109
Oh, fuck!

1407
01:14:08,111 --> 01:14:10,044
Ah...
Is everyone okay?

1408
01:14:10,046 --> 01:14:11,279
Not really.

1409
01:14:11,281 --> 01:14:12,847
What happened?

1410
01:14:12,849 --> 01:14:14,315
We're fucked.

1411
01:14:14,317 --> 01:14:16,417
Fallon: Oh my God, you guys,
jail fucking sucks.

1412
01:14:16,419 --> 01:14:19,754
Jaxi: But on a Saturday night,
jail sucks donkey dick.

1413
01:14:19,756 --> 01:14:23,057
Hold on. Stop it.
No one's going to jail.

1414
01:14:23,059 --> 01:14:25,426
Guy.
Unless you can fly...

1415
01:14:25,428 --> 01:14:28,229
Come on, come on.
Let's go!

1416
01:14:28,231 --> 01:14:31,065
<i>(Siren whirrs)</i>

1417
01:14:33,203 --> 01:14:34,535
All right.
Guys, come on.

1418
01:14:34,537 --> 01:14:36,237
Nikki:
Even if you leave the car,

1419
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:37,638
they're still gonna
arrest you at home.

1420
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:40,107
But they're not gonna arrest you.
Come on!

1421
01:14:40,109 --> 01:14:43,144
Jaxi:
Down the alley. Go!

1422
01:14:50,453 --> 01:14:53,221
Officer: <i>Adam 12 to dispatch of
the 29th alleyway of 3rd and 4th...</i>

1423
01:14:53,223 --> 01:14:54,889
<i>we're requesting</i>
<i>additional units, over.</i>

1424
01:14:54,891 --> 01:14:56,424
Officer 2:
Let's head 'em off at Temple.

1425
01:14:56,426 --> 01:14:58,526
Let's move, let's move

1426
01:15:01,197 --> 01:15:04,065
(siren whirrs)

1427
01:15:10,039 --> 01:15:13,941
Jaxi: Come on!
Hey, wait for the white people!

1428
01:15:17,514 --> 01:15:19,080
Jaxi:
Oh, watch out for that.

1429
01:15:22,285 --> 01:15:24,051
Hey, hey, hey!

1430
01:15:45,208 --> 01:15:47,742
<i>(Siren whirrs)</i>

1431
01:15:55,151 --> 01:15:56,617
Nikki:
We lost them.

1432
01:15:56,619 --> 01:15:59,186
Jaxi: Who are the baddest
bitches on the planet?

1433
01:15:59,188 --> 01:16:02,023
We are!
Nobody's fucking with us!

1434
01:16:03,493 --> 01:16:06,594
I'd hug you right now...
if I had arms.

1435
01:16:08,698 --> 01:16:10,865
I guess I got
a little carried away.

1436
01:16:10,867 --> 01:16:12,900
Just a teeny tiny.

1437
01:16:12,902 --> 01:16:15,536
(Jaxi laughs)

1438
01:16:15,538 --> 01:16:17,438
Hey, do you have
a bobby pin?

1439
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:19,674
Sparkly or regular?

1440
01:16:19,676 --> 01:16:21,409
Fallon!

1441
01:16:21,411 --> 01:16:23,244
Jeez.
Give it here.

1442
01:16:24,914 --> 01:16:27,114
Jaxi:
<i>Wake your ass up, ho.</i>

1443
01:16:27,116 --> 01:16:28,549
Fallon:
<i>Huh?</i>

1444
01:16:28,551 --> 01:16:30,985
This is my souvenir.

1445
01:16:30,987 --> 01:16:33,487
Wait. Aren't you
forgetting something?

1446
01:16:33,489 --> 01:16:35,556
Oh yeah. My money.

1447
01:16:35,558 --> 01:16:39,026
For such a bad night,
it was actually pretty good.

1448
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:42,997
We have Guy
to thank for this.

1449
01:16:42,999 --> 01:16:46,300
You rocked harder
than Eric Carr.

1450
01:16:46,302 --> 01:16:48,235
The Fox.

1451
01:16:48,237 --> 01:16:50,304
You're
a stand-up guy, Guy.

1452
01:16:50,306 --> 01:16:52,039
Hey, you too. Well...

1453
01:16:52,041 --> 01:16:53,741
I get it.

1454
01:16:53,743 --> 01:16:55,643
I gotta get
this one to bed.

1455
01:16:55,645 --> 01:16:57,845
(Yawning)
Bye, guys.

1456
01:16:59,315 --> 01:17:01,816
Guy, you can
drive me any time.

1457
01:17:01,818 --> 01:17:04,585
As soon as I get
out of jail.

1458
01:17:04,587 --> 01:17:06,487
Fallon:
Ahh, hold me.

1459
01:17:06,489 --> 01:17:08,589
(Dog barking)

1460
01:17:08,591 --> 01:17:11,959
You're taking
the dog out.

1461
01:17:18,635 --> 01:17:20,635
Nikki:
Can you wait a bit?

1462
01:17:20,637 --> 01:17:22,970
Guy: It'll just be a sec,
I gotta take her bags up.

1463
01:17:22,972 --> 01:17:25,606
Nikki: Well, actually,
it might be more than a sec.

1464
01:17:25,608 --> 01:17:27,708
I wanna show you
something.

1465
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:30,845
After all you've done,
you deserve a reward.

1466
01:17:34,283 --> 01:17:36,017
(Door creaks)

1467
01:17:39,355 --> 01:17:41,622
Can I get you a drink?

1468
01:17:41,624 --> 01:17:44,258
Ahh...
No, thank you, I'm good.

1469
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:46,293
I'll be right back.

1470
01:17:55,905 --> 01:17:57,772
Guy:
Wow.

1471
01:17:57,774 --> 01:18:02,276
This is an impressive
amount of tea pots here.

1472
01:18:02,278 --> 01:18:05,746
Nikki: <i>Thanks.
Yeah, I've been collecting 'em forever.</i>

1473
01:18:05,748 --> 01:18:08,516
<i>They're mostly vintage.</i>

1474
01:18:08,518 --> 01:18:10,017
<i>I'm really into animal ones.</i>

1475
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:12,953
<i>I've gotten some</i>
<i>sick deals on eBay.</i>

1476
01:18:14,290 --> 01:18:18,926
<i>See that elephant one</i>
<i>with the pink flower?</i>

1477
01:18:18,928 --> 01:18:21,295
<i>Guess how much</i>
<i>I paid for that?</i>

1478
01:18:21,297 --> 01:18:24,331
Uh, fifteen dollars?

1479
01:18:24,333 --> 01:18:27,034
Ninety-nine cents.
Plus shipping.

1480
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:29,503
You can't beat that
with a stick.

1481
01:18:29,505 --> 01:18:33,941
Wow. No, that is a sick deal.

1482
01:18:34,944 --> 01:18:39,246
Wow, yeah...
Your place is...

1483
01:18:39,248 --> 01:18:41,449
very tastefully done.

1484
01:18:42,452 --> 01:18:45,219
<i>(Jazz music playing)</i>

1485
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:51,225
I'm glad you're
noticing these things.

1486
01:18:51,227 --> 01:18:54,895
It's good, considering
why I brought you here.

1487
01:19:00,737 --> 01:19:03,838
I want to show you
something.

1488
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:07,041
Something very personal.

1489
01:19:15,318 --> 01:19:18,486
Nikki:
It's mine, that land.

1490
01:19:18,488 --> 01:19:22,189
The only thing
it's missing is a house.

1491
01:19:23,192 --> 01:19:25,793
A tasteful house.

1492
01:19:29,332 --> 01:19:33,534
You realize,
building a house from the ground up

1493
01:19:33,536 --> 01:19:36,237
is incredibly expensive.

1494
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:40,407
I mean, it could be hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

1495
01:19:40,409 --> 01:19:43,110
Guy, what do you
know about me?

1496
01:19:44,147 --> 01:19:45,346
Not much.

1497
01:19:45,348 --> 01:19:47,515
What's one thing
you do know?

1498
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:51,552
You like money?

1499
01:19:51,554 --> 01:19:54,922
And do you think I spend it,
or save it?

1500
01:19:57,660 --> 01:19:59,126
Save it?

1501
01:19:59,128 --> 01:20:02,530
And if I've been
saving for eleven years,

1502
01:20:02,532 --> 01:20:04,498
how much
do you think I have?

1503
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:06,167
A lot?

1504
01:20:06,169 --> 01:20:08,569
Try a fuck of a lot.

1505
01:20:10,006 --> 01:20:12,807
So when can I see
those drawings?

1506
01:20:14,243 --> 01:20:16,577
Next week. Definitely.

1507
01:20:16,579 --> 01:20:18,746
I expect a friends
and family discount.

1508
01:20:18,748 --> 01:20:21,282
Yeah, without a doubt.

1509
01:20:22,585 --> 01:20:24,885
Let me give you
my lawyer's details.

1510
01:20:24,887 --> 01:20:27,888
Have your wife call as soon as the police arrest you.

1511
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:30,124
Tell her
Patricia referred you.

1512
01:20:30,126 --> 01:20:33,260
That's your real name?
Patricia?

1513
01:20:33,262 --> 01:20:35,062
Patricia Cornbluth.

1514
01:20:35,064 --> 01:20:38,999
Now beat it.
I need my beauty sleep.

1515
01:20:39,001 --> 01:20:42,403
Thank you.
Patricia...

1516
01:20:43,439 --> 01:20:45,039
Guy:
<i>Cornbluth.</i>

1517
01:20:48,477 --> 01:20:50,010
Nikki:
Oh, and, Guy?

1518
01:20:50,012 --> 01:20:52,780
When you come back
with those drawings...

1519
01:20:52,782 --> 01:20:55,616
these will be
waiting for you.

1520
01:20:55,618 --> 01:20:59,086
(Chuckles)
I can't wait.

1521
01:21:42,164 --> 01:21:44,231
You came back.

1522
01:21:44,233 --> 01:21:46,967
Anne...

1523
01:21:46,969 --> 01:21:50,838
I am so sorry that I got us into this mess,

1524
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:53,040
but Nikki...

1525
01:21:53,042 --> 01:21:57,745
she has this lawyer who will handle the entire thing,

1526
01:21:57,747 --> 01:22:01,382
and she might not charge us,
as a favor to Nikki.

1527
01:22:01,384 --> 01:22:04,752
I think if
I go peacefully,

1528
01:22:04,754 --> 01:22:08,555
maybe they won't
come down too hard on me.

1529
01:22:08,557 --> 01:22:10,791
What are you
talking about?

1530
01:22:10,793 --> 01:22:14,561
Weren't... they here?
The police?

1531
01:22:15,665 --> 01:22:17,298
No.

1532
01:22:19,402 --> 01:22:21,068
Did they call?

1533
01:22:21,070 --> 01:22:23,037
No, Guy, no police
have come or called.

1534
01:22:23,039 --> 01:22:25,439
What the hell
is going on?

1535
01:22:31,013 --> 01:22:34,815
Maybe I dreamt
the whole thing.

1536
01:22:34,817 --> 01:22:37,251
Anne: <i>Are you</i>
<i>in some kind of trouble?</i>

1537
01:22:40,389 --> 01:22:41,989
Maybe not.

1538
01:22:45,861 --> 01:22:49,129
I'm glad you're back.

1539
01:22:49,131 --> 01:22:52,967
I didn't think you were coming
back after my mini meltdown.

1540
01:22:55,838 --> 01:22:58,973
You're allowed
to have a meltdown.

1541
01:22:58,975 --> 01:23:02,276
Of course
I was coming back.

1542
01:23:02,278 --> 01:23:05,079
How else was I gonna be
able to give you this?

1543
01:23:07,483 --> 01:23:09,650
What did you have to do
to get all this?

1544
01:23:09,652 --> 01:23:11,385
You don't wanna know.

1545
01:23:11,387 --> 01:23:12,686
Actually, I do.

1546
01:23:14,724 --> 01:23:18,892
Okay.
I'll tell you everything.

1547
01:23:18,894 --> 01:23:22,196
Because...
Because the police

1548
01:23:22,198 --> 01:23:26,433
are probably going
to come here and take me away.

1549
01:23:26,435 --> 01:23:29,103
So, umm...
What?

1550
01:23:29,105 --> 01:23:32,172
But I want you
to know that...

1551
01:23:36,045 --> 01:23:39,780
I don't care anymore
about ducks being in a row.

1552
01:23:41,283 --> 01:23:43,017
I don't.

1553
01:23:43,019 --> 01:23:45,419
Ducks be damned.

1554
01:23:45,421 --> 01:23:49,089
As long as I have you
and our daughter...

1555
01:23:50,226 --> 01:23:52,526
Ducks can go
fuck themselves.

1556
01:23:52,528 --> 01:23:55,896
I don't think that
would be a good idea.

1557
01:23:55,898 --> 01:23:59,033
Then there'd just be
more to take care of.

1558
01:24:00,503 --> 01:24:03,971
Is that...
is that a siren?

1559
01:24:03,973 --> 01:24:07,207
No. That is
the John Lennon mobile

1560
01:24:07,209 --> 01:24:08,709
I attached to the crib.

1561
01:24:10,046 --> 01:24:12,780
I assembled it myself...

1562
01:24:12,782 --> 01:24:15,549
and a few other things.

1563
01:24:52,421 --> 01:24:55,155
(Siren whirrs)

1564
01:25:00,463 --> 01:25:03,764
Isn't this that Volvo
we were lookin' for.

1565
01:25:08,471 --> 01:25:11,205
It is that Volvo
we were lookin' for.

1566
01:25:11,207 --> 01:25:15,342
Motherfucker's behind
on like, six payments.

1567
01:25:15,344 --> 01:25:17,678
(Chuckles)

1568
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:19,780
Let's go repo that shit.

1569
01:25:19,782 --> 01:25:21,715
Yeah.
Yeah.

1570
01:25:21,717 --> 01:25:23,117
(Chuckles)

1571
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:40,222
