1
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:45,776
<i>This is a story about a man
named Eddie...</i>

2
00:00:45,811 --> 00:00:50,407
<i>and it begins at the end,
with Eddie dying in the sun.</i>

3
00:01:12,905 --> 00:01:14,638
<i>You might think it strange...</i>

4
00:01:14,673 --> 00:01:16,766
<i>to start a story
with an ending.</i>

5
00:01:19,945 --> 00:01:23,381
<i>But all endings
are also beginnings...</i>

6
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:27,777
<i>We just don't know it
at the time.</i>

7
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,697
You lose this?

8
00:01:50,142 --> 00:01:51,744
I suppose I should
come down there...

9
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:53,234
and give it back to you, huh?

10
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:58,779
That's what I thought.

11
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,559
You love this balloon?

12
00:02:15,701 --> 00:02:17,535
Then hold tight to it.

13
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:21,006
- Thanks, Eddie Maintenance.
- Just Eddie.

14
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:24,443
But your shirt says,
'Eddie Main-te-nance.'

15
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,911
Well, Eddie is my name.

16
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:30,816
Maintenance is my job.
And this is just a shirt.

17
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:33,285
You have a cool job.

18
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,152
Well...

19
00:02:35,187 --> 00:02:36,814
go catch up with your father.

20
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:09,234
<i>Years ago, people
thought of Ruby Pier...</i>

21
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:12,651
<i>as a magical
and mysterious place.</i>

22
00:03:28,507 --> 00:03:30,805
<i>Once, even Eddie
felt that way.</i>

23
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,920
What are we gonna
fix today, pop?

24
00:03:42,955 --> 00:03:44,616
I don't know, Eddie.
Whatever's broke.

25
00:03:47,526 --> 00:03:49,760
Where ya been?

26
00:03:49,795 --> 00:03:51,764
Hey, Gracie. How's tricks?

27
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:53,364
Okay.

28
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,498
Hiya, Eddie.

29
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:55,817
Watch the kid for me,
will ya?

30
00:03:55,852 --> 00:03:57,102
Sure... How long
you gonna be?

31
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:58,469
Not long.

32
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:01,064
C'mon, Eddie. You want
to fix something for me?

33
00:04:36,842 --> 00:04:38,471
Is it fixed yet?

34
00:04:38,506 --> 00:04:40,101
Good as new, Pop.

35
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,950
Where's your brother?

36
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:47,217
I dunno.

37
00:04:47,252 --> 00:04:48,617
Well, find him.

38
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:51,555
What is it with you two?

39
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,285
He was supposed
to be here by now.

40
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,264
What the hell
happened to you?

41
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:02,631
These guys...
they took my jacket...

42
00:05:03,969 --> 00:05:05,636
There were four of 'em, Pop.

43
00:05:05,671 --> 00:05:07,866
I coulda taken two,
but there were four...

44
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,613
What are you waitin' for?
What are you waiting for?

45
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,205
Take care of it!

46
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,593
Hey, pretty sharp!

47
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,155
Not again!

48
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,956
Look at you!

49
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:00,891
Look at ya... you're bleeding.

50
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:04,628
You get 'em, then?

51
00:06:04,663 --> 00:06:06,765
What are you talking about?

52
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,449
Did you put him up to this?

53
00:06:09,484 --> 00:06:12,098
I asked you... did you get 'em?

54
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:18,709
Good boy.

55
00:06:18,744 --> 00:06:20,979
Honestly.
This fighting has to stop!

56
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:23,082
You wanna grow up
to be an engineer?

57
00:06:23,117 --> 00:06:24,968
Do you? How you
gonna be an engineer...

58
00:06:25,003 --> 00:06:27,028
if your hands are
all busted up, huh?

59
00:06:27,063 --> 00:06:29,054
Eddie's too dumb
to be an engineer.

60
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:31,490
- Hey, careful!
- Knock it off!

61
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:32,718
You, too.

62
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:35,459
This war in Europe keeps up...

63
00:06:35,494 --> 00:06:37,962
you'll be lucky to get
a crappy job like mine...

64
00:06:52,644 --> 00:06:54,874
<i>Eddie...
Eddie, are you there?</i>

65
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,250
Yeah, Dom.

66
00:07:00,285 --> 00:07:04,289
<i>Hey, Eddie, we need
the keys to gate 16...</i>

67
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:05,779
I'm on my way.

68
00:07:07,793 --> 00:07:12,594
<i>The last hour of Eddie's life
was spent like all the others.</i>

69
00:07:32,117 --> 00:07:34,551
<i>Children liked Eddie.</i>

70
00:07:34,586 --> 00:07:37,422
<i>Teenagers gave him headaches.</i>

71
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,089
Knock it off!

72
00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:41,149
What do you think you're doing!
It ain't safe!

73
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:47,166
They wanna get through
in there, Jason.

74
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:48,690
Clean it up.

75
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:06,110
Eddie Maintenance?

76
00:08:07,619 --> 00:08:08,984
Just Eddie.

77
00:08:12,491 --> 00:08:14,755
Eddie... can you...

78
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:18,621
Come on, kiddo.
I ain't got all day.

79
00:08:19,698 --> 00:08:22,166
Can you make me an animal?

80
00:08:37,716 --> 00:08:40,810
- Where's your mother?
- She's over there eating.

81
00:08:41,987 --> 00:08:47,791
- Without you?
- With her boyfriend.

82
00:08:47,826 --> 00:08:51,763
That's the piece that makes
it work... watch... here...

83
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:53,931
there, like that...

84
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:57,336
- and then...
- It's a rabbit!

85
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,055
Yeah, rabbit.

86
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,704
Thank you!

87
00:09:00,739 --> 00:09:02,604
Go show your mother
what you got.

88
00:09:17,022 --> 00:09:19,823
<i>Eddie rode every ride
at Ruby Pier...</i>

89
00:09:19,858 --> 00:09:23,089
<i>once a week to be certain
they were safe.</i>

90
00:09:24,863 --> 00:09:26,430
<i>He'd done it for so long...</i>

91
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:28,665
<i>he could almost 'hear'
trouble coming...</i>

92
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,466
<i>in the spits and sputters of
the engines and the brakes.</i>

93
00:09:37,342 --> 00:09:41,904
<i>Often he thought this was no way
for a man to grow old.</i>

94
00:09:43,348 --> 00:09:48,053
<i>But this was his life, 'Eddie
Maintenance' they called him...</i>

95
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,681
<i>and a maintenance man he was.</i>

96
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:02,962
Can I go now, Pop?

97
00:10:07,205 --> 00:10:09,400
- Is it fixed?
- It's fixed.

98
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,869
Take that!

99
00:10:39,904 --> 00:10:41,569
You're dead.

100
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,876
Practicing to kill, are ya, lad?

101
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,079
Hello, Mr. Shea.

102
00:10:49,114 --> 00:10:52,651
You got any spare change you
ain't put in that toy gun there?

103
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:55,118
That was my last nickel.

104
00:10:55,153 --> 00:10:56,745
Have you seen
your father, then?

105
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,487
We were in the war together.

106
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:04,061
Here's the thing about the war.

107
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:08,266
You don't think.
You just shoot and you shoot...

108
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:10,029
and then you pray
you come home.

109
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:16,800
It's the thinking
that gets you killed.

110
00:12:23,942 --> 00:12:26,209
Eddie! Eddie!
The skeeball's broken.

111
00:12:26,244 --> 00:12:28,476
Come on, Eddie,
come on, come on!

112
00:12:39,524 --> 00:12:42,687
It's just the lever here.
There ya go, boys.

113
00:12:43,795 --> 00:12:44,961
Juggle.

114
00:12:44,996 --> 00:12:47,164
Yeah! Juggle, Eddie! Come on!

115
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:50,930
Alright, alright...
you got the magic ball.

116
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,039
How does he do it, folks?

117
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:56,073
Greatest show on earth...

118
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,610
watch him, buddy boys,
and you will be amazed...

119
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:00,168
Excuse me...

120
00:13:01,646 --> 00:13:03,011
Excuse me.

121
00:13:06,518 --> 00:13:08,247
What?

122
00:13:11,456 --> 00:13:14,793
My friends and I were looking
for some of those lemon fizzes.

123
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:19,131
Yeah, right over there
by the carousel.

124
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,463
But that stand's closed already.

125
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,531
But I can fix that...

126
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:48,627
So, do you have a key
for all the food stands?

127
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:50,458
I got a key for everything.

128
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:55,533
Well, to be honest,
they're my Pop's keys...

129
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:58,837
He's the maintenance...
he fixes stuff here.

130
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:00,203
I'm just helping him out...

131
00:14:00,238 --> 00:14:02,297
to save up enough money
for engineering school.

132
00:14:03,808 --> 00:14:05,742
After the army, of course.

133
00:14:07,979 --> 00:14:10,882
- You enlisted?
- Last week.

134
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,645
I gotta do my part.

135
00:14:14,786 --> 00:14:16,419
Well... I better get back.

136
00:14:16,454 --> 00:14:19,480
My friend's will think I swam off
into the ocean or something.

137
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,258
A souvenir.

138
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,808
I don't know your name.

139
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:38,298
Marguerite.

140
00:14:39,444 --> 00:14:41,144
I'm Eddie.

141
00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:43,477
Thanks for the fizz, Eddie.

142
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,360
It's the birthday boy!

143
00:15:00,395 --> 00:15:02,391
Happy birthday, boss!

144
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:08,306
C'mon, Eddie. Live it up.
You only get a birthday, what?

145
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:10,240
Once a year?

146
00:15:10,275 --> 00:15:12,175
Sounds about right.

147
00:15:13,511 --> 00:15:15,146
How old are you now?

148
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:16,909
Old.

149
00:15:18,516 --> 00:15:20,585
Man, I hope I live
to be as old as you.

150
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,303
Why?

151
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,986
Dom...

152
00:15:25,223 --> 00:15:26,774
put the tools in the right spot.

153
00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:28,325
Them labels are there
for a reason.

154
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,868
Hey, don't forget,
I'm off next week.

155
00:15:38,903 --> 00:15:41,963
Me and Maria going to Miami
for our anniversary.

156
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:48,078
- You ever been to Miami?
- Me?

157
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,915
I never been anywhere I wasn't
shipped to with a rifle.

158
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,473
Here...

159
00:15:54,352 --> 00:15:55,986
Naw... I can't.

160
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:58,290
Buy your wife something nice.

161
00:15:58,325 --> 00:15:59,780
You sure?

162
00:16:02,427 --> 00:16:04,156
Thanks, man.

163
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,502
Is that going to be enough?

164
00:16:14,537 --> 00:16:16,133
- There you go.
- Thank you!

165
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:31,181
Marguerite you want
to do the honors?

166
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,900
- Who's this from?
- I don't know...

167
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:20,437
<i>You made me love you</i>

168
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:26,377
<i>All the time you knew it
I guess you always knew it</i>

169
00:17:27,412 --> 00:17:30,280
<i>You made happy</i>

170
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:32,050
You look swell tonight.

171
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:33,642
Thank you.

172
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:36,920
Eddie.

173
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:39,656
Are you afraid?

174
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:43,286
- I'd be afraid.
- You ain't the fightin' type.

175
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:53,304
Look at it this way. I get to
see some faraway places, right?

176
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:55,238
I always wanted to do that.

177
00:17:55,273 --> 00:17:57,742
I've never been more than
five miles from here.

178
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:01,112
Me, neither...
But that's gonna change.

179
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:02,746
Really?

180
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:05,716
I ain't spending the rest
of my life at Ruby Pier.

181
00:18:13,191 --> 00:18:14,920
Marguerite...

182
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:20,189
You don't have to ask me.

183
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,690
I don't?

184
00:18:25,036 --> 00:18:27,004
- Ask you what?
- To wait.

185
00:18:36,681 --> 00:18:38,945
Just don't die, ok?

186
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:41,812
I ain't gonna die.

187
00:18:43,855 --> 00:18:45,447
I ain't gonna die...

188
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:25,522
<i>Eddie! Eddie!</i>

189
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,355
I see it! I see it!
Get up there!

190
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,535
Alright everybody, stay calm...
stay calm!

191
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,671
Who's up there with ya?

192
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:40,670
Willie!

193
00:20:40,705 --> 00:20:43,007
Okay, tell Willie to release
the safety bars...

194
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:45,908
<i>green button, rear panel...
you got it?</i>

195
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:49,097
Then send down that cart!

196
00:20:49,132 --> 00:20:51,249
Everybody just stay calm...

197
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:53,046
Hydraulics, gears...

198
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:57,187
- cables...
- Rear panel, safety box...

199
00:21:02,627 --> 00:21:03,726
It's the cable...

200
00:21:03,761 --> 00:21:05,353
This will all be over
in a few minutes...

201
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,706
Don't release the cart...
it's gonna fall...

202
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:16,172
it's gonna fall!

203
00:21:16,207 --> 00:21:19,677
Get back, all of ya's!
Get back! Back!

204
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:21,846
It's gonna fall! Get back!

205
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:24,178
Back! Move!

206
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,016
All of ya's, get back... move!

207
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:33,686
Get back, it's gonna fall!

208
00:22:04,722 --> 00:22:07,885
<i>This is a story about
a man named Eddie.</i>

209
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:13,758
<i>But the end of his life
was only the beginning.</i>

210
00:22:35,453 --> 00:22:39,082
<i>Eddie saw nothing of his
final moment on earth...</i>

211
00:22:40,858 --> 00:22:43,418
<i>He felt no pain from his death.</i>

212
00:22:45,129 --> 00:22:49,361
<i>All he felt was lightness,
and calm...</i>

213
00:22:51,469 --> 00:22:54,572
<i>as if every hurt he had
ever suffered...</i>

214
00:22:54,607 --> 00:22:56,597
<i>had been washed away.</i>

215
00:23:01,746 --> 00:23:02,804
<i>And then he woke up.</i>

216
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:12,809
<i>How about him,
ladies and gentlemen?</i>

217
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:16,644
<i>Have you ever seen
a more horrible sight?</i>

218
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:26,855
<i>Look well upon this savage!
He is not of the human race!</i>

219
00:25:38,736 --> 00:25:41,103
<i>From the farthest corners
of the earth...</i>

220
00:25:41,138 --> 00:25:45,598
<i>we bring you this tragic soul
for your examination...</i>

221
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:23,808
Hello, Edward.

222
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:27,010
I have been waiting for you.

223
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:37,893
<i>Eddie had seen this man
before in his life.</i>

224
00:26:42,266 --> 00:26:44,615
Don't be afraid...

225
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:46,964
don't be afraid.

226
00:26:48,339 --> 00:26:51,536
<i>He didn't know why
he was seeing him again.</i>

227
00:26:53,077 --> 00:26:56,046
Your body feels like
a child's, no?

228
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:04,522
You were a child
when you knew me...

229
00:27:04,557 --> 00:27:06,756
that's why.

230
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:10,454
You start here with the same
feelings you had on earth.

231
00:27:13,764 --> 00:27:16,528
You can't talk
when you first arrive.

232
00:27:17,868 --> 00:27:21,326
God's little lesson, I suppose.

233
00:27:31,515 --> 00:27:33,506
Helps you listen.

234
00:27:56,841 --> 00:28:00,607
Tell me something.
The 'Bullwhip'.

235
00:28:03,047 --> 00:28:06,574
Is it still the fastest
roller coaster on earth?

236
00:28:12,056 --> 00:28:13,921
I figured as much.

237
00:28:14,992 --> 00:28:18,160
Nothing changes here.

238
00:28:18,195 --> 00:28:21,528
And there is no peering down
from the clouds, I'm afraid.

239
00:28:29,473 --> 00:28:31,373
Yes.

240
00:28:32,543 --> 00:28:34,306
You died.

241
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:43,786
An accident.

242
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:51,689
How long ago?

243
00:28:54,031 --> 00:28:56,697
A minute. An hour.

244
00:28:56,732 --> 00:28:59,364
A thousand years.

245
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:03,897
Where are you?

246
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:08,074
Where do you think?

247
00:29:13,417 --> 00:29:15,351
Heaven.

248
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:34,470
There are five people you meet
in heaven, Edward.

249
00:29:35,639 --> 00:29:38,369
Each one of us was
in your life for a reason.

250
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:51,822
People think of heaven
as a Garden Of Eden...

251
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:53,687
mountains, rivers.

252
00:29:55,893 --> 00:29:59,294
But what is scenery
without solace?

253
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:05,402
This is the greatest gift
God can give you, Edward...

254
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:09,202
to understand your life
on Earth.

255
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:13,367
'Tis why you are here.

256
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:49,547
When I died, my life is
lluminated by five others.

257
00:30:49,582 --> 00:30:52,141
And then I came here
to wait for you.

258
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:56,742
To tell you my story.
Which becomes part of yours.

259
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:01,725
Did you ever dance here?

260
00:31:05,896 --> 00:31:08,023
I never danced with a woman.

261
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:12,827
I was a nervous boy,
and a nervous man.

262
00:31:14,104 --> 00:31:15,969
Everything scared me.

263
00:31:17,374 --> 00:31:18,440
<i>What the hell's wrong
with you?</i>

264
00:31:18,475 --> 00:31:20,442
<i>You were born
with two left feet!</i>

265
00:31:20,477 --> 00:31:24,715
A chemist, for my problem,
gave me silver nitrate.

266
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,205
You know this?

267
00:31:27,551 --> 00:31:29,685
Yes. A poison, today.

268
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,321
But we were not
so smart back then.

269
00:31:32,356 --> 00:31:37,261
I drank it and when it didn't
work, I drank more.

270
00:31:37,296 --> 00:31:40,364
It turned my skin this color.

271
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,198
A side effect.

272
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,224
Permanent, I'm afraid.

273
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:47,594
My life as a man was over.

274
00:31:48,639 --> 00:31:51,403
My life as a freak had begun.

275
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,736
I had many names.

276
00:32:02,771 --> 00:32:05,354
Algeria. Tanzania.

277
00:32:05,389 --> 00:32:08,459
I had never been
to any of those places.

278
00:32:08,494 --> 00:32:10,825
It made me feel... exotic.

279
00:32:11,962 --> 00:32:17,134
One summer, I came here.
Ruby Pier.

280
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:19,835
The ocean. The sand.

281
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:23,207
I could walk in the mornings,
before the customers arrived.

282
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:26,233
I can feel the sea breeze.
Like a normal man.

283
00:32:28,245 --> 00:32:31,510
I was happy here
until the day I died.

284
00:32:33,884 --> 00:32:37,251
You see, Edward.
This is not your heaven.

285
00:32:40,524 --> 00:32:42,014
It's mine.

286
00:32:51,468 --> 00:32:52,799
What?

287
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,956
What...

288
00:32:55,991 --> 00:32:57,608
killed...

289
00:32:57,643 --> 00:32:59,235
you?

290
00:33:01,445 --> 00:33:03,174
You did.

291
00:33:49,526 --> 00:33:51,153
You see the boy?

292
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:58,358
See the man in the car?

293
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:04,197
It was only my second time.

294
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:09,376
It was on a Saturday morning.
I thought, what can happen?

295
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:14,385
I so loved it, behind
the wheel of an automobile.

296
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,216
Like a normal man.

297
00:34:22,926 --> 00:34:24,484
Watch it... look out!

298
00:34:36,273 --> 00:34:39,208
What I almost did.
That little boy.

299
00:34:41,912 --> 00:34:43,812
My blood was rushing.

300
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,475
My heart was not strong.

301
00:34:49,086 --> 00:34:50,815
And it surrendered.

302
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:59,229
The police wrote 'heart attack'
on the official papers.

303
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,459
No one saw.
No one knew.

304
00:35:02,499 --> 00:35:06,993
No one pays much notice to
a freak, even when he dies.

305
00:35:16,346 --> 00:35:20,612
People just...
go on with their lives...

306
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:27,585
You see now
why you are here...

307
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:46,910
God help me, Mister.
I didn't mean it...

308
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:48,944
You dying...
I didn't know!

309
00:35:48,979 --> 00:35:52,015
But how could you know?
You were only a child.

310
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,917
So now I gotta pay, right?

311
00:35:53,952 --> 00:35:56,452
- Pay?
- For my sin?

312
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:59,221
That's what I'm here for,
right? Justice?

313
00:35:59,256 --> 00:36:02,593
No, no, no, no. You are here
so I can teach you something.

314
00:36:02,628 --> 00:36:04,193
Each one of your five people...

315
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:07,463
has one such thing
to show you, to illuminate.

316
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:11,434
By the end, what you did not
understand in life, you will.

317
00:36:12,269 --> 00:36:14,404
<i>But why do I have
to wear Joe's shoes?</i>

318
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:17,339
<i>- Quiet!
- Stop wiggling!</i>

319
00:36:17,374 --> 00:36:20,676
But it's my birthday!
I don't want to go.

320
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:23,247
Well, sometimes you have to do
things you don't want to do.

321
00:36:23,282 --> 00:36:26,842
I remember this...
we had to go to a funeral...

322
00:36:28,385 --> 00:36:30,586
your funeral?

323
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:33,215
But it's my birthday!

324
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:38,627
What did I say?

325
00:36:38,662 --> 00:36:41,187
What did I say?
I said be quiet!

326
00:36:52,442 --> 00:36:54,239
Ma?

327
00:36:57,514 --> 00:36:59,106
Come on, son.

328
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,847
I did not attract
a big crowd that day.

329
00:37:36,219 --> 00:37:38,086
But it's not fair!

330
00:37:38,121 --> 00:37:40,424
It was my own stupidity,
running out there like that.

331
00:37:40,459 --> 00:37:42,016
I should have been
the one killed...

332
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,818
not you!

333
00:37:48,265 --> 00:37:51,464
Fairness does not
govern life and death.

334
00:37:51,499 --> 00:37:54,664
If it did, no good man
would ever die young.

335
00:37:58,208 --> 00:38:00,275
During my time on earth...

336
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:02,710
people died instead
of me, too.

337
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:07,816
An airplane crashes that
you should have been on.

338
00:38:07,851 --> 00:38:11,787
A fire burns the building that
you left an hour before.

339
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:20,294
There are no random acts.
We are all connected.

340
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:25,133
- Good comes from it.
- Good?

341
00:38:25,168 --> 00:38:27,337
What good came from this?
You died.

342
00:38:27,372 --> 00:38:28,986
Well...

343
00:38:29,021 --> 00:38:30,601
you lived.

344
00:38:35,145 --> 00:38:37,705
But I barely knew you.
We were strangers.

345
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:45,916
Strangers are just family
you have yet to come to know.

346
00:39:00,303 --> 00:39:04,672
I am leaving now, Edward.
I can go on.

347
00:39:06,076 --> 00:39:07,634
Wait...

348
00:39:09,579 --> 00:39:12,247
The little girl
at the pier?

349
00:39:12,282 --> 00:39:15,851
I tried to save her...
I felt her hands...

350
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:18,354
I musta pulled her...
I can't remember after that...

351
00:39:20,724 --> 00:39:24,387
Did I save her? Was the last
thing I did a failure, too?

352
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:28,089
I cannot answer that.

353
00:39:29,332 --> 00:39:31,935
Then... my life was a waste...

354
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:34,062
No life is a waste.

355
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:47,747
There will be others.
Your journey does not end here.

356
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:51,648
Can I ask you...

357
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:54,421
where are you going?

358
00:39:57,494 --> 00:39:59,894
I'm not.

359
00:40:25,388 --> 00:40:27,253
Couldn't sleep.

360
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:29,952
Me, neither.

361
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,903
When you think they'll
open us up again?

362
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:42,463
I don't know.
Ask the police.

363
00:40:51,448 --> 00:40:53,439
I still can't believe it,
you know?

364
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:57,851
I always thought he was
too stubborn to die.

365
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:11,262
<i>There was a second
heaven for Eddie...</i>

366
00:41:12,969 --> 00:41:16,097
<i>although heaven was not
the word he would have chosen.</i>

367
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:27,711
<i>His body felt
older now, stronger.</i>

368
00:41:29,152 --> 00:41:33,248
<i>And he ran with the hard,
measured steps of a soldier.</i>

369
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:22,132
Smallpox!

370
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:25,868
Smallpox! Typhoid!

371
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:28,410
Tetanus!

372
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:31,175
Yellow Fever!

373
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:36,302
You know, I never did find out
what the hell Yellow Fever was.

374
00:42:36,337 --> 00:42:40,156
All them shots, for all those
diseases, and I still died here...

375
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:45,095
anyhow, healthy as a horse.
Doesn't seem right, does it?

376
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:47,564
Coulda saved my arm
all them pokey needles.

377
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:48,895
Who are you?

378
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:55,262
How do you like them apples?

379
00:42:56,306 --> 00:42:59,442
Come on.
That was funny.

380
00:42:59,477 --> 00:43:00,875
Come on down!

381
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,743
Come on up!

382
00:43:16,526 --> 00:43:18,551
Ah, you don't wanna look down.

383
00:43:19,696 --> 00:43:21,527
It'll only make ya dizzy.

384
00:43:27,604 --> 00:43:29,538
You got real old...

385
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:34,036
that's a compliment.

386
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:40,946
They explain the rules
to you, soldier?

387
00:43:41,985 --> 00:43:45,255
- I'm dead...
- You got that right.

388
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:47,891
You're my second person?

389
00:43:47,926 --> 00:43:50,458
Got that right, too.

390
00:43:50,493 --> 00:43:52,825
Left you your helmet.
And your old rifle.

391
00:43:53,863 --> 00:43:56,058
Not that they're much use
to ya here.

392
00:43:58,401 --> 00:44:00,114
Captain?

393
00:44:00,149 --> 00:44:01,827
Affirmative.

394
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:09,976
Betcha didn't expect me, huh?

395
00:44:38,074 --> 00:44:39,341
Hey Goldilocks...

396
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:40,721
it'll take you a lot
longer than that...

397
00:44:40,756 --> 00:44:42,067
to get as pretty as me,
you know that!

398
00:45:06,436 --> 00:45:09,530
<i>Dog Zero Six, this is
Able Zero Six, over.</i>

399
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:14,307
<i>Dog Zero Six, if you copy,
break squelch, twice, over.</i>

400
00:45:18,848 --> 00:45:22,052
C'mon, Rabozzo, ya stickpin.
Pick it up!

401
00:45:22,087 --> 00:45:23,518
It's hot.

402
00:45:23,553 --> 00:45:25,384
And I got all this
extra stuff to carry.

403
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:29,559
Ah, I'm sorry Daisy, you got a
little stain on your dress, there?

404
00:45:29,594 --> 00:45:32,960
Shut your yap!
Must be jingle-brained...

405
00:45:35,198 --> 00:45:36,995
Keep it on that ridge.

406
00:45:44,207 --> 00:45:46,674
I can't...

407
00:45:46,709 --> 00:45:48,761
You can't? What do you
mean, you can't?

408
00:45:48,796 --> 00:45:50,779
What are you going
to just sit there?

409
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:53,817
- Get up! Hey, get up!
- Hold on, Morton, hold on.

410
00:45:53,852 --> 00:45:56,820
Before you go killing anybody.
I got a better idea.

411
00:45:56,855 --> 00:45:58,685
Give me your pack, Rabozzo.

412
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:01,121
Come on.

413
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:08,798
I'll race you to the Captain.
I'll carry his pack...

414
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:11,401
Ioser's gotta carry it
till dark.

415
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:13,470
Okay, Goldilocks.
You're on.

416
00:46:13,505 --> 00:46:15,470
You sure you can do that,
Eddie?

417
00:46:15,505 --> 00:46:17,273
You ever run up a roller coaster
with a sledgehammer?

418
00:46:17,308 --> 00:46:19,173
Come on, Rabozzo, go.

419
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,111
Say your prayers, buddy boy.

420
00:46:29,185 --> 00:46:31,387
- What the hell you grunts doing?
- It's a race, Cap!

421
00:46:31,422 --> 00:46:33,854
A race! That's open ground!

422
00:46:33,889 --> 00:46:36,286
On three. One... two...

423
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,524
Look at Eddie go.

424
00:46:46,202 --> 00:46:49,000
Man, he's a carny. He probably
walks tightropes, too.

425
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:53,276
Go, go, go! Move it!

426
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:54,709
Open up!

427
00:46:59,516 --> 00:47:00,778
Come on, Eddie!

428
00:47:18,067 --> 00:47:19,815
Captain?

429
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:21,564
It is you.

430
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:25,840
But you look...

431
00:47:25,875 --> 00:47:28,469
Like the last time you saw me?

432
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:36,786
See, time ain't what
you think it is, kid.

433
00:47:36,821 --> 00:47:38,887
Either is dying.

434
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:42,192
I figure it's like that whole
Adam and Eve thing, right?

435
00:47:42,227 --> 00:47:44,511
Adam's first night on Earth...

436
00:47:44,546 --> 00:47:46,761
when he lays down to sleep...

437
00:47:46,796 --> 00:47:49,063
he probably thinks,
that's it, right?

438
00:47:49,098 --> 00:47:51,834
His eyes are closing,
the world's over, he's a gonner...

439
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:54,170
what does he know from sleep?

440
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:56,437
Next morning he wakes up!

441
00:47:56,472 --> 00:48:01,211
He still has the world,
but now he has something else...

442
00:48:01,246 --> 00:48:03,008
he has his yesterday.

443
00:48:09,852 --> 00:48:11,953
Aw, you're right.

444
00:48:11,988 --> 00:48:14,457
No reason to spit up here.

445
00:48:14,492 --> 00:48:16,774
No reason to smoke.

446
00:48:16,809 --> 00:48:19,057
Old habits, I guess.

447
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:22,330
Look, Captain... sir.

448
00:48:22,365 --> 00:48:25,368
No reason for that either,
but much obliged.

449
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:28,371
Captain, there's some
kinda mistake going on.

450
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:30,939
I mean. I don't belong here.

451
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:34,143
I lived a nothin' life, see?
I never went nowhere.

452
00:48:34,178 --> 00:48:36,879
I never accomplished
anything worth note.

453
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:39,165
Couldn't find a job?

454
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,382
No. No, I had a job.

455
00:48:41,417 --> 00:48:46,689
A dumb job. I fixed the rides
at this amusement park.

456
00:48:46,724 --> 00:48:48,281
Ruby Pier.

457
00:48:49,792 --> 00:48:51,292
Ruby Pier.

458
00:48:51,327 --> 00:48:54,731
That's the place you always used
to tell us about, right?

459
00:48:54,766 --> 00:48:58,566
We were all gonna go there
when the war was done.

460
00:48:58,601 --> 00:49:02,503
'Free rides with the prettiest
ladies in the tunnel of love.'

461
00:49:07,543 --> 00:49:09,238
That's right.

462
00:49:10,913 --> 00:49:13,383
You ever seen them boys again?

463
00:49:13,418 --> 00:49:15,374
Morton? Smitty?

464
00:49:19,088 --> 00:49:21,886
Morton... Smitty...

465
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:30,031
Throw the pineapple!

466
00:49:30,066 --> 00:49:32,302
Throw it, Johnny, come on!

467
00:49:32,337 --> 00:49:34,463
Johnny!
The grenade!

468
00:49:50,586 --> 00:49:53,783
<i>Eddie learned
the quiet prayers of war.</i>

469
00:49:55,958 --> 00:49:58,227
<i>He learned to go
days without rest...</i>

470
00:49:58,262 --> 00:50:00,388
<i>and nights without sleep.</i>

471
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:04,934
<i>He learned how
to take a prisoner...</i>

472
00:50:04,969 --> 00:50:07,702
<i>but not how to become one.</i>

473
00:50:07,737 --> 00:50:10,501
<i>And then one night,
in the Philippines...</i>

474
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:13,933
<i>he learned that, too.</i>

475
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:37,896
- Who's that?
- Shut it, kid.

476
00:50:39,769 --> 00:50:41,236
Aw, you bastards...

477
00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:48,409
Eddie?

478
00:50:48,444 --> 00:50:49,968
You heard him, kid.
Shut it.

479
00:50:54,016 --> 00:50:55,711
They're gonna kill us.

480
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:01,824
I never saw none of them
boys after the war.

481
00:51:01,859 --> 00:51:05,728
Well, people lose touch...

482
00:51:05,763 --> 00:51:07,829
- So.
- What?

483
00:51:07,864 --> 00:51:10,924
You went back to that park,
you took that job. Then what?

484
00:51:12,101 --> 00:51:15,405
Then nothing. I never left.

485
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,554
I meant to. But I...

486
00:51:17,589 --> 00:51:19,669
things never worked out.

487
00:51:21,377 --> 00:51:24,879
Money. My leg.

488
00:51:24,914 --> 00:51:27,382
I never really got the war
out of my head.

489
00:51:29,318 --> 00:51:31,218
Maybe you weren't supposed to.

490
00:54:28,297 --> 00:54:30,299
One more sip for me,
okay champ?

491
00:54:30,334 --> 00:54:32,062
Do that for me...

492
00:54:34,103 --> 00:54:36,071
Good. That's it.

493
00:54:41,143 --> 00:54:42,710
What is it?

494
00:54:42,745 --> 00:54:45,339
In this rat hole?
Could be anything.

495
00:54:46,882 --> 00:54:48,985
He can't keep his food down.

496
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,384
What food?

497
00:54:50,419 --> 00:54:52,188
I'm freezing...

498
00:54:52,223 --> 00:54:53,655
Oh God...

499
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:58,927
Easy, buddy boy... easy.

500
00:55:09,505 --> 00:55:11,672
Where is everybody?

501
00:55:11,707 --> 00:55:14,075
They're losing this war...

502
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:17,136
How desperate do they gotta be
using us to do this?

503
00:55:18,914 --> 00:55:21,517
I figure some go awol
every night.

504
00:55:21,552 --> 00:55:23,576
Rats off a sinking ship.

505
00:55:26,822 --> 00:55:29,313
- How much longer?
- Not much.

506
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:33,429
I seen them digging
ditches up the way.

507
00:55:33,464 --> 00:55:35,192
Now the oil barrels.

508
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,834
So?

509
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:42,505
The oil's for burning
the evidence.

510
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:44,268
They're digging our graves.

511
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:52,238
He's sick...

512
00:55:58,487 --> 00:56:00,890
He's sick, you son of a bitch!

513
00:56:00,925 --> 00:56:02,687
For God's sake, Eddie.

514
00:56:18,007 --> 00:56:18,974
No!

515
00:56:20,342 --> 00:56:24,108
No!

516
00:57:00,483 --> 00:57:03,281
I used to pray every night
during the war.

517
00:57:04,987 --> 00:57:06,320
I'd take Marguerite's picture...

518
00:57:06,355 --> 00:57:08,482
and I'd make these deals
with God, see.

519
00:57:09,892 --> 00:57:12,259
I'd say...

520
00:57:12,294 --> 00:57:15,097
I'll give you one more
week as a soldier...

521
00:57:15,132 --> 00:57:17,064
if you give me
one more week with her.

522
00:57:17,099 --> 00:57:20,364
I'll give you one more month
in this life...

523
00:57:22,204 --> 00:57:24,604
if you give me one month
in that one.

524
00:57:27,643 --> 00:57:29,410
Used to?

525
00:57:29,445 --> 00:57:32,847
I stopped the night
they shot Rabozzo.

526
00:57:32,882 --> 00:57:35,009
All I could think about
after that was getting out.

527
00:57:36,051 --> 00:57:39,578
I was gonna take care
of myself, if I made it...

528
00:57:40,689 --> 00:57:42,316
in one piece.

529
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:45,486
That never happened,
of course.

530
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,563
You know,
it's the damndest thing.

531
00:57:54,703 --> 00:57:56,227
I'm dead.

532
00:57:57,506 --> 00:57:59,667
But I feel...
I feel healthy.

533
00:58:01,377 --> 00:58:03,140
Strong as I ever was.

534
00:58:05,014 --> 00:58:06,641
You still juggle?

535
00:58:36,912 --> 00:58:38,743
Captain...

536
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:44,149
Captain...

537
00:58:48,424 --> 00:58:50,392
I think we got a chance here.

538
00:59:00,269 --> 00:59:02,802
What're you talking about?

539
00:59:02,837 --> 00:59:05,335
- I can juggle.
- What?

540
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:10,144
I can juggle.
Them rocks.

541
00:59:15,351 --> 00:59:16,716
Hey!

542
00:59:17,953 --> 00:59:21,116
Hey you! Over here!

543
00:59:23,492 --> 00:59:24,823
I can juggle...

544
00:59:25,861 --> 00:59:27,658
Juggle?

545
00:59:29,064 --> 00:59:31,294
Yeah, here. Lemme try.

546
00:59:34,236 --> 00:59:37,603
Lemme try. I can do it.

547
00:59:40,309 --> 00:59:41,833
What's going on?

548
00:59:49,718 --> 00:59:51,276
Okay?

549
00:59:56,025 --> 00:59:59,962
Huh, you like that?
Yeah, see?

550
00:59:59,997 --> 01:00:02,328
Okay, give me one more.

551
01:00:03,499 --> 01:00:05,634
- Motto.
- Motto?

552
01:00:05,669 --> 01:00:07,735
Yeah, one more.

553
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:10,330
One more...
I can do it.

554
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:14,876
Yeah, motto.
I'll juggle them for you.

555
01:00:19,815 --> 01:00:21,282
Alright...

556
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:26,649
Yeah, he's good...

557
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:29,290
Good...

558
01:00:29,325 --> 01:00:31,527
Good, huh?
Pretty good, huh?

559
01:00:31,562 --> 01:00:33,722
Good!
Boy can juggle!

560
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:36,932
- Motto...
- Motto?

561
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:38,968
Yeah, four!

562
01:00:39,003 --> 01:00:41,502
Four?

563
01:00:41,537 --> 01:00:44,131
Four rocks, yeah, I can do it.

564
01:00:51,246 --> 01:00:53,215
I'll get whosever
closest to the door...

565
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:54,515
Morton?

566
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:56,040
Just give me an opening.

567
01:01:00,889 --> 01:01:03,551
Yeah, right here...
right here.

568
01:01:06,562 --> 01:01:09,181
They're giving us rocks.

569
01:01:09,216 --> 01:01:11,292
Okay... it's okay... okay.

570
01:01:11,327 --> 01:01:13,369
Just having some fun...

571
01:01:13,404 --> 01:01:15,667
Juggle... juggle.

572
01:01:22,811 --> 01:01:24,045
You really this good?

573
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,279
I used to pitch, Captain.

574
01:01:29,918 --> 01:01:31,018
Look at this, huh?

575
01:01:31,053 --> 01:01:34,323
Isn't he something else,
ladies and gents?

576
01:01:34,358 --> 01:01:37,349
You get the one on the left,
alright!

577
01:01:42,931 --> 01:01:45,901
Smitty, you get
the one on the right...

578
01:01:45,936 --> 01:01:48,905
- Okay, ready for four?
- Four!

579
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:51,874
- You guys ready for four?
- Four!

580
01:01:51,909 --> 01:01:53,710
- Four?
- Four!

581
01:01:53,745 --> 01:01:55,511
On my count, guys...

582
01:01:55,546 --> 01:01:56,739
One!

583
01:01:58,614 --> 01:02:00,432
Two!

584
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:02,172
Three...

585
01:02:02,207 --> 01:02:03,878
Four!

586
01:02:45,227 --> 01:02:46,785
For Rabozzo.

587
01:03:00,309 --> 01:03:01,936
It was war, Eddie.

588
01:03:03,779 --> 01:03:05,804
I never stopped
thinking about it...

589
01:03:07,282 --> 01:03:10,953
my whole life...
these dreams...

590
01:03:10,988 --> 01:03:13,217
Every soldier has dreams.

591
01:03:14,256 --> 01:03:15,789
We coulda just run.

592
01:03:15,824 --> 01:03:17,883
We didn't have to destroy
the whole place.

593
01:03:19,495 --> 01:03:22,191
What did you see?
In those dreams?

594
01:03:26,468 --> 01:03:29,096
Hey, Eddie, what you doing?

595
01:03:37,646 --> 01:03:40,080
Yeah, burn it down, Eddie!

596
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:42,981
Burn the whole place down!

597
01:03:51,927 --> 01:03:53,224
Fire in the hole!

598
01:04:49,785 --> 01:04:51,810
Eddie! Come on!

599
01:04:52,854 --> 01:04:54,185
Let's go! Let's go!

600
01:05:00,295 --> 01:05:01,997
Eddie, what are you doing?
Are you coming?

601
01:05:02,032 --> 01:05:04,231
Is somebody in there?

602
01:05:04,266 --> 01:05:06,635
Eddie, Eddie,
we gotta go... come on!

603
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:08,035
There's somebody in there!

604
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:09,921
Come on, we gotta go,
let's go now!

605
01:05:09,956 --> 01:05:11,773
I think there's
somebody in there!

606
01:05:11,808 --> 01:05:14,660
Eddie... Movin' out! Let's go!

607
01:05:14,695 --> 01:05:17,477
You'll die in there! Come out!

608
01:05:17,512 --> 01:05:20,916
Eddie! There's nobody in there,
let's go!

609
01:05:20,951 --> 01:05:23,269
Come on, we gotta go, now!

610
01:05:23,304 --> 01:05:25,587
Come out! I won't shoot you...

611
01:05:33,996 --> 01:05:39,457
I'm a soldier...
I'm a soldier...

612
01:06:06,461 --> 01:06:08,554
You remember how
you got out of there?

613
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:16,872
That bullet got you good.

614
01:06:16,907 --> 01:06:18,567
Lost a lot of blood.

615
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:22,275
And them boys patched you up
as best they could.

616
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,848
Those planes firing.
I never...

617
01:06:28,016 --> 01:06:29,677
I never saw it coming...

618
01:06:31,586 --> 01:06:33,713
Everything changed after that.

619
01:06:35,123 --> 01:06:37,459
I couldn't run no more.

620
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:39,760
Couldn't play baseball.

621
01:06:39,795 --> 01:06:42,286
I used to swim the ocean
like a fish...

622
01:06:44,499 --> 01:06:46,433
You didn't stop walking.

623
01:06:47,602 --> 01:06:49,593
No, I just stopped... moving.

624
01:06:50,706 --> 01:06:53,334
I sorta sat down in my life.

625
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:04,016
I ever tell you I come
from a military family?

626
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:08,179
My father was a soldier...

627
01:07:09,524 --> 01:07:12,118
his father, and his father, too.

628
01:07:13,562 --> 01:07:16,331
At the dinner table it was
'yes, sir, no sir.'

629
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:18,856
All I did was take orders.

630
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:23,961
Then along comes a war, and all
of a sudden, I'm giving orders.

631
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:27,008
Kids are looking at me
for answers.

632
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:28,977
They thought I could
keep 'em alive.

633
01:07:29,012 --> 01:07:30,774
You did too, didn't ya?

634
01:07:37,619 --> 01:07:39,386
I couldn't, of course.

635
01:07:39,421 --> 01:07:41,412
I took orders
like everyone else.

636
01:07:42,791 --> 01:07:44,324
But I thought...

637
01:07:44,359 --> 01:07:46,860
if I couldn't keep you alive...

638
01:07:46,895 --> 01:07:48,920
at least I could
keep you together.

639
01:07:49,998 --> 01:07:53,126
In the middle of big war,
you grab at them little ideas.

640
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:58,498
We're going home together.

641
01:07:59,674 --> 01:08:01,164
That's right.

642
01:08:03,812 --> 01:08:05,575
Going home together...

643
01:08:07,816 --> 01:08:09,716
meant a lot, Captain.

644
01:08:17,826 --> 01:08:19,623
I hope so.

645
01:08:23,098 --> 01:08:24,759
Why do you say that?

646
01:08:27,202 --> 01:08:29,295
'Cause I was the one
who shot you.

647
01:08:32,841 --> 01:08:34,687
Not you...

648
01:08:34,722 --> 01:08:36,534
Not you...

649
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:42,783
Not you!

650
01:08:42,818 --> 01:08:44,513
Get it out...

651
01:08:47,389 --> 01:08:49,516
- Go ahead.
- Not you!

652
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:03,221
<i>The story of the tragedy
at Ruby Pier...</i>

653
01:09:03,256 --> 01:09:06,240
<i>was in the newspapers
for several days.</i>

654
01:09:14,049 --> 01:09:16,677
<i>Then other stories
took its place.</i>

655
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,869
Well, pretty tidy
for an old guy.

656
01:09:33,904 --> 01:09:35,769
Are you surprised?

657
01:09:37,005 --> 01:09:39,337
Don't think we'll find any
bank statements in there.

658
01:09:44,212 --> 01:09:46,915
It's the same apartment
Eddie grew up in.

659
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:49,149
I don't know why
he never moved out.

660
01:09:49,184 --> 01:09:50,981
You'd think he'd want
some air conditioning.

661
01:09:53,788 --> 01:09:55,585
You'd think he'd want
a change of scenery.

662
01:10:11,506 --> 01:10:13,371
There's the soldier boy.

663
01:10:15,443 --> 01:10:17,035
Hey, Eddie.

664
01:10:18,847 --> 01:10:20,610
Happy birthday, son.

665
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:23,049
Here's your cake.

666
01:10:25,954 --> 01:10:28,088
Happy birthday...

667
01:10:28,123 --> 01:10:29,647
Happy birthday, Eddie.

668
01:10:36,631 --> 01:10:39,183
Happy birthday, Eddie.

669
01:10:39,218 --> 01:10:41,736
Joe, you got matches?

670
01:10:41,771 --> 01:10:43,260
Here you go...

671
01:10:49,711 --> 01:10:51,178
Alright...

672
01:10:56,284 --> 01:10:58,351
Good job.

673
01:10:58,386 --> 01:11:00,320
You're alright, son.

674
01:11:03,558 --> 01:11:06,493
So he looks pretty good, all
things considered, don't he Pop?

675
01:11:13,535 --> 01:11:15,684
You look really good, son...

676
01:11:15,719 --> 01:11:17,834
Really, you look good, Eddie.

677
01:11:24,579 --> 01:11:26,381
You bastard!
How could you do that?

678
01:11:26,416 --> 01:11:28,183
- How could you do that?
- Get it out.

679
01:11:28,218 --> 01:11:31,217
My leg! My leg!

680
01:11:31,252 --> 01:11:32,754
- My life!
- Get it out...

681
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:34,988
My life! Why?

682
01:11:35,023 --> 01:11:39,392
- I had to.
- Why? Why?

683
01:11:39,427 --> 01:11:42,089
I took your leg
to save your life.

684
01:11:46,301 --> 01:11:48,603
You would have died
in that fire.

685
01:11:48,638 --> 01:11:49,669
You were obsessed.

686
01:11:49,704 --> 01:11:51,805
You damn near knocked
Morton unconscious.

687
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,576
Another second and you
woulda been so deep in...

688
01:11:54,611 --> 01:11:56,943
none of us
could have gotten you.

689
01:11:56,978 --> 01:12:01,383
There was nobody in that hut...
what was I thinking?

690
01:12:01,418 --> 01:12:04,451
I seen it happen
a hundred times.

691
01:12:04,486 --> 01:12:09,624
A soldier reaches a certain
point and he's done.

692
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:11,291
Sometimes,
in the dead of night...

693
01:12:11,326 --> 01:12:14,746
a man'll just come out of his
tent just start walking...

694
01:12:14,781 --> 01:12:18,166
like he lives around the corner,
like he's going home.

695
01:12:18,201 --> 01:12:22,537
- Why didn't I just die?
- Wasn't your time to die.

696
01:12:22,572 --> 01:12:26,008
I couldn't just let you
burn alive.

697
01:12:26,043 --> 01:12:28,961
I figured a leg
wound would heal...

698
01:12:28,996 --> 01:12:31,472
Morton pulled you
out of there.

699
01:12:31,507 --> 01:12:33,913
And the others got you home.

700
01:12:33,948 --> 01:12:36,816
What do you mean
'the others' got me home?

701
01:12:36,851 --> 01:12:38,987
It's just like I told you.
Tetanus? Yellow fever?

702
01:12:39,022 --> 01:12:42,357
All them shots?
Just a big waste of my time.

703
01:12:42,392 --> 01:12:43,949
Look.

704
01:12:50,432 --> 01:12:52,366
Look at it burn!
Hah, we're going home!

705
01:13:01,242 --> 01:13:03,543
Hang on, Eddie!
Come on...

706
01:13:03,578 --> 01:13:06,681
Eddie, look at me!
Come on, Eddie!

707
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:08,546
Eddie, look at me!

708
01:13:12,987 --> 01:13:15,255
Damn!

709
01:13:15,290 --> 01:13:17,292
I'm gonna blow that lock
and check around the curve.

710
01:13:17,327 --> 01:13:18,884
Keep an eye out.

711
01:13:20,161 --> 01:13:21,992
Hang on, Eddie!

712
01:13:28,870 --> 01:13:30,462
Hold on, okay?

713
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:34,274
We're going home.

714
01:13:34,309 --> 01:13:38,146
You wanna go home, don't ya?
Eddie! Look at me!

715
01:13:38,181 --> 01:13:42,173
Hey! Look at me!
Look at me! Eyes open!

716
01:13:48,823 --> 01:13:50,484
That's one of ours...

717
01:14:10,245 --> 01:14:12,008
Captain?

718
01:14:31,499 --> 01:14:33,694
I don't remember
none of this...

719
01:14:35,036 --> 01:14:37,472
I figure what was left of me...

720
01:14:37,507 --> 01:14:39,908
landed in about
a thousand places.

721
01:14:39,943 --> 01:14:41,608
Including here.

722
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:43,610
This is where you're buried?

723
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:47,182
That's a fancy way
of saying it, but yeah.

724
01:14:47,217 --> 01:14:48,681
This was my 'funeral'...

725
01:14:48,716 --> 01:14:51,920
Smitty, Morton... I never
saw them at the hospital.

726
01:14:51,955 --> 01:14:53,453
When I got home,
I didn't open mail.

727
01:14:53,488 --> 01:14:56,855
I didn't ask questions.
I just wanted to forget.

728
01:14:57,892 --> 01:15:00,061
You've been here all this time?

729
01:15:00,096 --> 01:15:02,195
Waitin' for you.

730
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:04,499
That's what the Blue Man said.

731
01:15:04,534 --> 01:15:06,599
Well, he was, too.

732
01:15:06,634 --> 01:15:08,670
But he had something
to teach you...

733
01:15:08,705 --> 01:15:10,001
and now he's moved on.

734
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:13,200
And I'm fixing to do the same.

735
01:15:14,576 --> 01:15:16,100
So...

736
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:21,149
What are you here?

737
01:15:21,184 --> 01:15:22,946
Sacrifice.

738
01:15:28,890 --> 01:15:31,524
I made one.
You made one.

739
01:15:31,559 --> 01:15:33,893
But you had the wrong
idea about yours.

740
01:15:33,928 --> 01:15:37,523
You got angry. Kept thinking
about what you lost.

741
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:53,246
You didn't get it.

742
01:15:53,281 --> 01:15:57,252
Sacrifice ain't something
to be ashamed of.

743
01:15:57,287 --> 01:15:59,186
It's something
to be proud of.

744
01:16:02,323 --> 01:16:05,059
If people stop sacrificing
for one another...

745
01:16:05,094 --> 01:16:07,084
they lose what
makes them human.

746
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:10,860
It's the noblest thing we do.

747
01:16:12,867 --> 01:16:15,068
But you lost everything.

748
01:16:15,103 --> 01:16:18,671
Well, that's the thing
about sacrifice.

749
01:16:18,706 --> 01:16:21,773
Sometimes when you think
you're losing something...

750
01:16:21,808 --> 01:16:24,840
you're really just passing
it on to someone else.

751
01:16:53,942 --> 01:16:56,240
Forgive me about the leg?

752
01:17:06,387 --> 01:17:08,548
That's what I was waiting for.

753
01:17:09,924 --> 01:17:11,721
- Captain.
- Yeah?

754
01:17:13,127 --> 01:17:14,924
Why this place?

755
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:19,567
I mean, you can choose
anywhere to wait... right?

756
01:17:19,602 --> 01:17:23,338
Well, I died knowing almost
nothing but war.

757
01:17:23,373 --> 01:17:27,075
I wanted to see what
the world looked like...

758
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:29,711
before we started
killing each other...

759
01:17:29,746 --> 01:17:33,147
Before war. But this is war.

760
01:17:35,984 --> 01:17:39,721
Our eyes ain't
the same, soldier.

761
01:17:39,756 --> 01:17:41,621
This is what I see.

762
01:18:02,443 --> 01:18:05,011
By the way, I don't smoke.

763
01:18:05,046 --> 01:18:08,750
That was all in your eyes, too.

764
01:18:08,785 --> 01:18:10,741
Who smokes in heaven?

765
01:18:26,067 --> 01:18:27,659
This is yours...

766
01:18:29,737 --> 01:18:31,789
Well...

767
01:18:31,824 --> 01:18:33,433
Good luck.

768
01:18:33,468 --> 01:18:35,008
Wait...

769
01:18:35,043 --> 01:18:38,346
Wait. The little girl
at the pier, did I save her?

770
01:18:38,381 --> 01:18:41,115
I can't remember.
I only felt...

771
01:18:41,150 --> 01:18:43,501
her hands. Her little hands.

772
01:18:43,536 --> 01:18:45,853
I just wanna know, that's all.

773
01:18:45,888 --> 01:18:47,548
I can't tell you.

774
01:18:53,027 --> 01:18:54,892
But someone can.

775
01:19:15,083 --> 01:19:17,643
Come on! Let's get some
ice off the truck!

776
01:19:26,394 --> 01:19:28,123
C'mon, Eddie!

777
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:35,152
Strike now, you can
hit it, let's go!

778
01:19:35,187 --> 01:19:37,263
Give it a ride, Eddie!
Murder the ball!

779
01:19:37,298 --> 01:19:39,340
Eddie can't hit it past
the first sewer!

780
01:19:39,375 --> 01:19:41,035
Strike him out.

781
01:19:44,245 --> 01:19:47,013
Go kid.

782
01:19:47,048 --> 01:19:48,606
Keep going, kid.

783
01:19:53,821 --> 01:19:55,345
Go! Keep going!

784
01:19:58,426 --> 01:20:00,018
Slide! Slide!

785
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:44,502
Got these for you.

786
01:20:51,979 --> 01:20:53,640
You should call her.

787
01:20:58,419 --> 01:21:00,114
She waited for you, Eddie.

788
01:21:06,294 --> 01:21:08,127
Your brother Joe called.

789
01:21:08,162 --> 01:21:10,563
He starts that
sales job tomorrow...

790
01:21:10,598 --> 01:21:12,934
Your father says there might be
some work at Ruby Pier.

791
01:21:12,969 --> 01:21:14,402
Help you get some money
for engineering classes.

792
01:21:14,437 --> 01:21:16,370
Not Ruby Pier.

793
01:21:17,405 --> 01:21:18,304
What's that?

794
01:21:18,339 --> 01:21:21,467
I ain't working at Ruby Pier.

795
01:21:23,344 --> 01:21:25,335
All those people I know...

796
01:21:30,318 --> 01:21:32,653
I don't feel like it, Ma. OK?

797
01:21:32,688 --> 01:21:34,416
Yeah ok.

798
01:21:43,497 --> 01:21:45,158
Shut the door, will ya?

799
01:21:59,513 --> 01:22:02,883
<i>Digby rocks back and fires,
here's a strike called...</i>

800
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:05,010
<i>and the count
is strike one on him...</i>

801
01:22:06,153 --> 01:22:07,353
He just needs a little time.

802
01:22:07,388 --> 01:22:10,324
He needs to get off his high
horse, that's what he needs.

803
01:22:10,359 --> 01:22:12,460
Working at the pier ain't good
enough for him?

804
01:22:12,495 --> 01:22:15,728
Stop it! After what
he's been through.

805
01:22:15,763 --> 01:22:17,164
How the hell you know
what he's been through?

806
01:22:17,199 --> 01:22:19,533
- He don't even talk.
- Look at him.

807
01:22:19,568 --> 01:22:20,833
Do you ever look at him?

808
01:22:20,868 --> 01:22:23,283
Something awful
happened over there!

809
01:22:23,318 --> 01:22:25,698
Well, something awful
happens every day.

810
01:22:29,744 --> 01:22:31,439
I go now.

811
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:55,469
Get up, and get a job!

812
01:22:55,504 --> 01:22:57,300
Go to bed, Pop.

813
01:23:01,409 --> 01:23:03,811
Get up, and get a job!

814
01:23:03,846 --> 01:23:06,481
You're drunk, Pop.

815
01:23:06,516 --> 01:23:09,081
Get up, and get a job!

816
01:23:09,116 --> 01:23:11,243
That it, you think
you're better than me?

817
01:23:16,424 --> 01:23:20,027
Get up, get a job,
get up, get a job...

818
01:23:20,062 --> 01:23:21,517
Enough!

819
01:23:23,230 --> 01:23:24,830
See? You ain't so hurt.

820
01:23:24,865 --> 01:23:27,034
You ain't so hurt,
and you ain't so tough...

821
01:23:27,069 --> 01:23:29,662
not so I can't whip you
like I used to.

822
01:23:31,172 --> 01:23:33,435
No more...

823
01:23:33,470 --> 01:23:35,699
No more...

824
01:24:33,067 --> 01:24:37,401
<i>Eddie's third heaven was
a place he'd never seen before.</i>

825
01:24:45,012 --> 01:24:48,614
<i>His body was decaying...</i>

826
01:24:48,649 --> 01:24:51,709
<i>and his soul
was growing restless.</i>

827
01:26:39,159 --> 01:26:40,786
Is it fixed?

828
01:26:43,464 --> 01:26:45,762
I'm here, Pop! I'm here!
Look at me!

829
01:26:47,101 --> 01:26:50,002
I'm here! Look at me!

830
01:26:50,037 --> 01:26:52,528
- Look at me!
- He can't hear you.

831
01:26:54,074 --> 01:26:55,701
Don't be angry.

832
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:01,747
My father's in there!

833
01:27:01,782 --> 01:27:04,483
Well, he's not really here.

834
01:27:04,518 --> 01:27:08,389
It's only his spirit,
safe from harm.

835
01:27:08,424 --> 01:27:10,256
That's part of my heaven.

836
01:27:10,291 --> 01:27:13,160
Why does my father
have to be safe for you?

837
01:27:13,195 --> 01:27:15,262
Would you like me to explain?

838
01:27:15,297 --> 01:27:17,563
No.

839
01:27:17,598 --> 01:27:20,301
- Where are you going?
- I wanna go home...

840
01:27:20,336 --> 01:27:22,903
- Come with me.
- No.

841
01:27:22,938 --> 01:27:24,336
Edward...

842
01:27:27,975 --> 01:27:29,636
Can I see earth again?

843
01:27:30,678 --> 01:27:33,579
I'm afraid not.

844
01:27:33,614 --> 01:27:37,851
Then can I go back, to my life?
Can I promise to be better?

845
01:27:37,886 --> 01:27:39,853
Why do you want to go back?

846
01:27:39,888 --> 01:27:42,321
Why? Why?

847
01:27:42,356 --> 01:27:43,822
Because you... this...

848
01:27:43,857 --> 01:27:46,493
none of it makes no sense
to me, that's why.

849
01:27:46,528 --> 01:27:47,693
Heaven. Where are the people...

850
01:27:47,728 --> 01:27:48,861
you're supposed
to see in heaven...

851
01:27:48,896 --> 01:27:50,364
My brother... my brother
died before me...

852
01:27:50,399 --> 01:27:51,849
my mother...

853
01:27:51,884 --> 01:27:53,265
I had friends...

854
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:55,700
I can't even remember
my own end.

855
01:27:56,937 --> 01:27:59,701
There was this little girl.
The cart was falling...

856
01:28:01,909 --> 01:28:03,900
I felt her little hands...

857
01:28:05,613 --> 01:28:08,673
- And that was when I...
- Passed away?

858
01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:12,920
Went to the other side?

859
01:28:12,955 --> 01:28:14,888
Met your maker?

860
01:28:16,090 --> 01:28:17,614
Died.

861
01:28:19,326 --> 01:28:23,262
What do you remember? About
that moment when you died?

862
01:28:29,036 --> 01:28:31,163
Floating.

863
01:28:32,973 --> 01:28:35,703
And colors. Colors like
I'd never seen.

864
01:28:38,812 --> 01:28:41,148
No offence lady,
but I don't know you.

865
01:28:41,183 --> 01:28:43,139
But I know you...

866
01:28:45,185 --> 01:28:48,985
if you have a spare moment
for me, now...

867
01:29:24,558 --> 01:29:27,026
The Seaside...
I remember this old place.

868
01:29:29,296 --> 01:29:31,628
They tore it down years ago...

869
01:29:37,137 --> 01:29:39,203
There I am...

870
01:29:39,238 --> 01:29:41,270
I was pretty.

871
01:29:43,477 --> 01:29:46,879
- You worked here?
- Yes, why?

872
01:29:46,914 --> 01:29:49,516
You don't seem...
the waitress type.

873
01:29:49,551 --> 01:29:53,270
Well, I wasn't always
well-to-do.

874
01:29:53,305 --> 01:29:56,265
My family was poor.
Like most.

875
01:29:56,300 --> 01:29:59,932
I left school early
to work.

876
01:29:59,967 --> 01:30:03,529
We all, my sisters and I.

877
01:30:03,564 --> 01:30:06,333
Until we married.
I'd held up the longest.

878
01:30:06,368 --> 01:30:08,300
Until Emil.

879
01:30:08,335 --> 01:30:10,571
He came to the diner
every morning.

880
01:30:10,606 --> 01:30:12,738
And he ate such big breakfasts.

881
01:30:12,773 --> 01:30:16,908
'Oh, what a big appetite
he has! ' I thought.

882
01:30:16,943 --> 01:30:21,044
But Emil's appetite was
for more than just food.

883
01:30:23,584 --> 01:30:27,988
Well, I was pretty
in those days.

884
01:30:28,023 --> 01:30:29,988
And Emil...

885
01:30:30,023 --> 01:30:34,361
he was so charming
and adventurous.

886
01:30:34,396 --> 01:30:35,828
And rich.

887
01:30:36,864 --> 01:30:39,025
Oh, my what a big
fortune he had.

888
01:30:42,236 --> 01:30:44,727
You've seen these pictures?

889
01:30:49,977 --> 01:30:52,946
They were in the old files
in the workshop.

890
01:30:53,981 --> 01:30:55,614
Most of it was before my time.

891
01:30:55,649 --> 01:30:59,419
Things that come before
your time can still affect you.

892
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:02,479
Even if they are
in the 'old files'...

893
01:31:04,458 --> 01:31:07,325
He loved those
seaside fun parks.

894
01:31:08,662 --> 01:31:11,331
He asked me to
marry him in one.

895
01:31:11,366 --> 01:31:12,898
When I said yes...

896
01:31:12,933 --> 01:31:16,334
he promised he would capture
that moment forever.

897
01:31:18,138 --> 01:31:20,868
So he built his monument...

898
01:31:21,909 --> 01:31:25,779
a place where children could
always be children...

899
01:31:25,814 --> 01:31:28,339
and adults never
had to grow up.

900
01:31:29,383 --> 01:31:32,050
He brought in animals,
and clowns...

901
01:31:32,085 --> 01:31:37,758
a carousel from France, and a
Ferris Wheel from Germany...

902
01:31:37,793 --> 01:31:41,694
and his piece-de-resistance...

903
01:31:43,530 --> 01:31:45,713
the entrance.

904
01:31:45,748 --> 01:31:47,897
Oh, it was grand!

905
01:31:50,137 --> 01:31:52,128
'Sweetheart' he said...

906
01:31:53,774 --> 01:31:56,143
'everyone who comes
through these gates...

907
01:31:56,178 --> 01:31:59,510
will have to pass
under your gaze.'

908
01:32:03,584 --> 01:32:05,211
I don't understand.

909
01:32:07,654 --> 01:32:08,887
The name!

910
01:32:08,922 --> 01:32:11,323
Weren't you ever curious
about the name?

911
01:32:11,358 --> 01:32:13,560
The place where you worked?
Where your father worked?

912
01:32:13,595 --> 01:32:16,961
All those years?
Ruby Pier?

913
01:32:25,505 --> 01:32:26,870
Up here.

914
01:32:28,642 --> 01:32:30,269
I am Ruby.

915
01:32:41,588 --> 01:32:43,385
Man, this feels weird...

916
01:32:48,562 --> 01:32:50,291
Maybe this is something...

917
01:32:57,938 --> 01:32:59,496
Lemon Fizz...

918
01:33:07,381 --> 01:33:09,941
Damn! A Bronze Star!

919
01:33:15,789 --> 01:33:17,723
This ain't right.

920
01:33:17,758 --> 01:33:20,460
Forget these insurance people.

921
01:33:20,495 --> 01:33:22,121
Bad enough what happened.

922
01:33:23,196 --> 01:33:25,061
Yeah let him rest in peace.

923
01:33:26,934 --> 01:33:29,468
Lay off the kid, already!
That's enough!

924
01:33:29,503 --> 01:33:33,273
Don't you tell me what's enough.
He's gotta learn a lesson.

925
01:33:33,308 --> 01:33:35,642
Dad, please, don't,
no please don't do it...

926
01:33:35,677 --> 01:33:36,909
- Stop it!
- Quiet!

927
01:33:36,944 --> 01:33:40,380
No, Dad, I promise, I won't
do it again, please, stop...

928
01:33:40,415 --> 01:33:43,178
- Oh my lord.
- What's that smoke?

929
01:33:50,190 --> 01:33:52,426
No, don't do this...
don't do this!

930
01:33:52,461 --> 01:33:53,916
What is it?

931
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:30,447
I remember this fire.
Burned down half the park.

932
01:34:30,482 --> 01:34:34,334
In those days, everything
was made of lathe and tar.

933
01:34:34,369 --> 01:34:36,700
Our pier was like
a matchbook...

934
01:34:39,706 --> 01:34:42,106
I begged Emil not to go.

935
01:34:43,143 --> 01:34:44,474
But of course he went.

936
01:34:45,512 --> 01:34:48,715
He wanted to save
his gift to me.

937
01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:51,049
They say he was...

938
01:34:51,084 --> 01:34:53,720
trying to save
the grand entrance...

939
01:34:53,755 --> 01:34:55,620
with my painting on it...

940
01:35:00,794 --> 01:35:02,421
when it collapsed.

941
01:35:09,403 --> 01:35:11,337
There was no insurance.

942
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:17,670
That was my Emil.
The risk taker.

943
01:35:19,146 --> 01:35:21,546
That one night,
we lost everything.

944
01:35:22,649 --> 01:35:24,951
But they rebuilt the park.
I remember...

945
01:35:24,986 --> 01:35:28,353
Someone else, not us.

946
01:35:28,388 --> 01:35:31,191
Emil was in the hospital
for months.

947
01:35:31,226 --> 01:35:33,159
It took most of our savings.

948
01:35:35,128 --> 01:35:38,757
Even so, he didn't want to
sell it. Can you imagine that?

949
01:35:40,867 --> 01:35:43,035
But I sold it.

950
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:47,734
To a rich railroad man.
He kept the name.

951
01:35:49,609 --> 01:35:51,841
I didn't care.

952
01:35:51,876 --> 01:35:54,074
We moved away...

953
01:35:55,282 --> 01:35:58,251
and I tended to my
beloved husband...

954
01:36:05,892 --> 01:36:10,022
and I nurtured
one impossible wish.

955
01:36:11,465 --> 01:36:13,732
What wish was that?

956
01:36:13,767 --> 01:36:16,099
That he'd never
built that place.

957
01:36:18,105 --> 01:36:20,369
I had that thought
a few times myself.

958
01:36:23,076 --> 01:36:26,739
I had dreams when I was a kid.

959
01:36:27,881 --> 01:36:31,249
Thought I'd be an engineer.

960
01:36:31,284 --> 01:36:32,717
But my father used to tell me...

961
01:36:32,752 --> 01:36:35,922
'the world is divided into
somebodys and nobodys, Eddie...

962
01:36:35,957 --> 01:36:37,981
and there's
a lot more nobodys'.

963
01:36:41,194 --> 01:36:44,162
He made sure
I was one of them.

964
01:36:44,197 --> 01:36:47,234
Eddie, your father
is not the reason...

965
01:36:47,269 --> 01:36:49,566
that you never left Ruby Pier.

966
01:36:50,971 --> 01:36:52,804
Oh no? What is?

967
01:36:52,839 --> 01:36:55,558
You still have two more
people to meet, dear.

968
01:36:55,593 --> 01:36:58,954
No, lady. I can meet
a thousand people...

969
01:36:58,989 --> 01:37:02,280
that ain't gonna change.
That pier...

970
01:37:02,315 --> 01:37:06,453
that dumb job, was the last
trick he pulled on me.

971
01:37:06,488 --> 01:37:08,045
How?

972
01:37:10,657 --> 01:37:12,352
By dying.

973
01:37:13,426 --> 01:37:14,893
Eddie?

974
01:37:17,564 --> 01:37:19,225
Eddie!

975
01:37:21,735 --> 01:37:23,464
It's your father!

976
01:37:24,804 --> 01:37:27,637
He collapsed. They took him
to the hospital.

977
01:37:29,142 --> 01:37:31,440
Oh, god. It's my fault!

978
01:37:32,846 --> 01:37:34,575
It's my fault!

979
01:37:36,950 --> 01:37:39,803
Her fault? He came
home one night...

980
01:37:39,838 --> 01:37:42,621
four in the morning,
soaking wet...

981
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:44,891
probably drunk as a skunk.
And he gets pneumonia.

982
01:37:44,926 --> 01:37:45,924
And it was her fault?

983
01:37:45,959 --> 01:37:48,560
But that's how he was,
my old man.

984
01:37:48,595 --> 01:37:50,363
You were always the one
doing something wrong.

985
01:37:50,398 --> 01:37:53,031
Never him.

986
01:37:53,066 --> 01:37:55,591
I took over his shifts while
he was in the hospital.

987
01:38:06,346 --> 01:38:09,213
I worked nights, weekends,
so he wouldn't lose his job.

988
01:38:11,251 --> 01:38:13,481
And then he died on me.

989
01:38:16,456 --> 01:38:18,456
My mother never did accept it.

990
01:38:18,491 --> 01:38:20,827
She kept talking to him
like he was still alive.

991
01:38:20,862 --> 01:38:22,294
One night, I went
over to see her...

992
01:38:22,329 --> 01:38:24,998
I said, 'Ma, you want I should
put these dishes away? '

993
01:38:25,033 --> 01:38:27,193
No, Eddie.
Your father will do it.

994
01:38:29,703 --> 01:38:31,000
Ma...

995
01:38:33,707 --> 01:38:35,436
Dad's gone.

996
01:38:36,910 --> 01:38:38,537
Gone where?

997
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:43,166
I moved back in here
the next week.

998
01:38:43,201 --> 01:38:45,817
And I took that job
to be around...

999
01:38:45,852 --> 01:38:49,185
to take care of my mother.
I became my old man...

1000
01:38:50,457 --> 01:38:52,288
And I never left.

1001
01:38:53,827 --> 01:38:55,760
What's happening?

1002
01:38:55,795 --> 01:38:58,765
You don't really know
how your father died.

1003
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:00,756
What are you talking about?

1004
01:39:05,839 --> 01:39:07,706
What's he doing here?

1005
01:39:07,741 --> 01:39:10,505
He's been fired. Drinking.

1006
01:39:11,544 --> 01:39:14,707
He came looking for your father.
But your father wasn't here.

1007
01:39:19,853 --> 01:39:21,388
Your mother is going
to get dressed...

1008
01:39:21,423 --> 01:39:23,219
to help him
find your father.

1009
01:39:41,141 --> 01:39:43,910
No... don't you move,
you bastard!

1010
01:39:43,945 --> 01:39:46,177
- This happened long ago.
- No!

1011
01:39:46,212 --> 01:39:48,772
What are you doing? No!
You don't want to do this!

1012
01:39:49,816 --> 01:39:51,647
What the hell is going on?

1013
01:39:52,986 --> 01:39:54,319
Come here!

1014
01:39:54,354 --> 01:39:56,354
- I'm all right...
- What did he do?

1015
01:39:56,389 --> 01:39:59,793
- I'm alright... I'm alright...
- What did he do?

1016
01:39:59,828 --> 01:40:03,524
I'm alright.
Don't do it! Don't!

1017
01:40:57,350 --> 01:40:59,484
Why didn't he let him drown?

1018
01:40:59,519 --> 01:41:02,754
- Why didn't he kill him?
- He wanted to.

1019
01:41:02,789 --> 01:41:05,656
But years ago, they fought
in the war together.

1020
01:41:07,794 --> 01:41:10,729
Mickey helped him
get his first job.

1021
01:41:12,399 --> 01:41:16,267
Your father held loyalty
in very high regard.

1022
01:41:17,604 --> 01:41:21,768
In the end, it mattered
more than his rage.

1023
01:41:25,412 --> 01:41:27,573
So he saved a life...

1024
01:41:29,582 --> 01:41:31,675
instead of taking one.

1025
01:41:50,503 --> 01:41:51,697
Pneumonia...

1026
01:41:55,008 --> 01:41:57,306
He fought the ocean
for a long time.

1027
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:04,083
Sometimes, he would cry out.
For your mother.

1028
01:42:04,118 --> 01:42:07,678
For your brother.
Or for you.

1029
01:42:10,256 --> 01:42:11,018
For me?

1030
01:42:13,827 --> 01:42:15,317
How do you know that?

1031
01:42:16,663 --> 01:42:19,154
There were two
patients to a room.

1032
01:43:02,475 --> 01:43:05,035
<i>Your father died in the middle
of the night.</i>

1033
01:43:09,716 --> 01:43:12,048
<i>When I found out
where he had worked...</i>

1034
01:43:13,086 --> 01:43:16,990
<i>I felt like someone of
my own family had died.</i>

1035
01:43:17,025 --> 01:43:20,091
<i>Again, I cursed Ruby Pier.</i>

1036
01:43:20,126 --> 01:43:24,654
I wished I could undo any harm
it had ever caused.

1037
01:43:27,834 --> 01:43:31,702
That wish formed my heaven.

1038
01:43:33,106 --> 01:43:36,876
I don't understand.
This old diner?

1039
01:43:36,911 --> 01:43:40,647
This old diner
is more than a place.

1040
01:43:40,682 --> 01:43:42,747
It's a time.

1041
01:43:42,782 --> 01:43:44,875
When things were simpler.

1042
01:43:46,052 --> 01:43:49,188
But those people inside?

1043
01:43:49,223 --> 01:43:51,691
They were all hurt.

1044
01:43:51,726 --> 01:43:53,057
Well...

1045
01:43:53,092 --> 01:43:56,361
Accidents. Fights.

1046
01:43:56,396 --> 01:43:59,565
Fires.
I would have none of it.

1047
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:02,700
My heaven would
be a place where...

1048
01:44:02,735 --> 01:44:06,086
anyone who ever suffered
from Ruby Pier...

1049
01:44:06,121 --> 01:44:09,437
even for a moment
would be safe forever.

1050
01:44:11,010 --> 01:44:12,875
Your father, too.

1051
01:44:13,913 --> 01:44:17,317
- I hated him, you know.
- I know.

1052
01:44:17,352 --> 01:44:19,183
He was hell on me as a kid.

1053
01:44:19,218 --> 01:44:21,584
And even worse
when I got older.

1054
01:44:24,090 --> 01:44:25,853
Once he couldn't
hit me no more...

1055
01:44:28,595 --> 01:44:30,997
he stopped talking
to me altogether.

1056
01:44:31,032 --> 01:44:32,396
Eddie.

1057
01:44:33,733 --> 01:44:37,136
Anger is a poison.

1058
01:44:37,171 --> 01:44:40,505
It eat us inside.

1059
01:44:40,540 --> 01:44:44,877
We think by hating someone
we hurt them...

1060
01:44:44,912 --> 01:44:48,031
but hatred is a curved blade.

1061
01:44:48,066 --> 01:44:51,150
And the harm
we do to others...

1062
01:44:51,185 --> 01:44:53,812
we also do to ourselves.

1063
01:44:57,924 --> 01:45:00,449
Why is everything so different
than I thought?

1064
01:45:01,661 --> 01:45:04,931
Well, when you first
arrived here...

1065
01:45:04,966 --> 01:45:06,865
do you remember
how you felt?

1066
01:45:09,202 --> 01:45:11,670
I had... no pain.

1067
01:45:12,772 --> 01:45:14,886
No worry.

1068
01:45:14,921 --> 01:45:17,001
No hate.

1069
01:45:19,545 --> 01:45:23,014
That's because no one
is born with anger.

1070
01:45:23,049 --> 01:45:26,819
We build it over the years,
with the things we don't say...

1071
01:45:26,854 --> 01:45:29,821
with the things we bury.

1072
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:33,559
When we die,
the soul is freed of it...

1073
01:45:33,594 --> 01:45:35,720
Free to see the truth.

1074
01:45:39,098 --> 01:45:41,225
So, what do I gotta do?

1075
01:45:45,505 --> 01:45:48,030
You need to forgive
your father.

1076
01:46:34,220 --> 01:46:35,744
Dad?

1077
01:46:38,291 --> 01:46:39,815
I'm here now...

1078
01:46:43,096 --> 01:46:44,825
I saw what happened.

1079
01:46:45,898 --> 01:46:48,399
I didn't understand you.

1080
01:46:48,434 --> 01:46:51,926
I still don't. You beat me.
You humiliated me.

1081
01:46:53,473 --> 01:46:55,168
I was your son!

1082
01:46:58,444 --> 01:47:00,139
Look at me, Pop...

1083
01:47:03,249 --> 01:47:04,876
I'm older than you...

1084
01:47:07,854 --> 01:47:10,880
I'm didn't know your life.
I didn't know you.

1085
01:47:14,026 --> 01:47:17,894
But I understand now.
I'm letting it go. All right?

1086
01:47:19,565 --> 01:47:21,533
Do we let it go?

1087
01:47:25,037 --> 01:47:28,404
I forgive you, OK?
You hear me?

1088
01:47:39,852 --> 01:47:42,218
I forgive you dad...

1089
01:47:46,292 --> 01:47:48,123
I forgive you.

1090
01:48:10,883 --> 01:48:12,748
It's fixed.

1091
01:48:23,429 --> 01:48:25,488
It's fixed.

1092
01:48:45,585 --> 01:48:47,485
It's fixed.

1093
01:49:19,552 --> 01:49:21,417
How old was the deceased?

1094
01:49:26,225 --> 01:49:29,558
I dunno.
It was his birthday.

1095
01:49:33,165 --> 01:49:35,030
What can you tell me about...

1096
01:49:38,170 --> 01:49:41,320
that I can share with
the other mournings.

1097
01:49:41,355 --> 01:49:44,471
You mean about Eddie?
About what was he like?

1098
01:49:46,178 --> 01:49:48,009
He was great.

1099
01:49:50,683 --> 01:49:53,015
You know, he'd do little things
for you sometimes...

1100
01:49:54,253 --> 01:49:57,848
give you some money,
help you out.

1101
01:49:59,025 --> 01:50:01,755
Don't get me wrong, he was
a tough old goat.

1102
01:50:02,828 --> 01:50:05,062
Everything had to be safe.

1103
01:50:05,097 --> 01:50:08,501
'Make it safe, Dom.'
'Grease them tracks, Dom.

1104
01:50:08,536 --> 01:50:10,799
Tighten them bolts, Dom.'

1105
01:50:11,938 --> 01:50:14,133
How about... personally?

1106
01:50:16,943 --> 01:50:18,877
Personally?

1107
01:50:26,319 --> 01:50:30,085
I know Eddie loved
his wife very much.

1108
01:50:37,630 --> 01:50:40,097
She gave him
this watch once.

1109
01:50:40,132 --> 01:50:43,169
One of those with
a ferri wheel o it.

1110
01:50:43,204 --> 01:50:45,694
He had never took it off.

1111
01:50:53,145 --> 01:50:55,705
Of course,
I never met her.

1112
01:50:57,883 --> 01:51:01,118
To the beautiful bride,
Marguerite...

1113
01:51:01,153 --> 01:51:03,639
and to the lucky groom,
Eddie, my kid brother...

1114
01:51:03,674 --> 01:51:06,125
who figured out you can get
a restaurant cheap...

1115
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:07,990
on Christmas eve!

1116
01:51:11,330 --> 01:51:13,499
To the bride and groom
everyone!

1117
01:51:13,534 --> 01:51:16,195
To the bride and groom!

1118
01:51:18,037 --> 01:51:20,239
I'm sorry we couldn't
afford more...

1119
01:51:20,274 --> 01:51:22,366
It's all I ever wanted.

1120
01:51:54,440 --> 01:51:56,909
Come on, Eddie.
We love this song.

1121
01:51:56,944 --> 01:51:59,378
- Ah, please...
- No, I can't...

1122
01:52:02,181 --> 01:52:04,081
You know
I can't move around.

1123
01:52:11,290 --> 01:52:13,087
Alright... alright.

1124
01:52:32,945 --> 01:52:35,981
- They're staring at me.
- I don't care.

1125
01:52:36,016 --> 01:52:37,846
I don't care.

1126
01:52:38,918 --> 01:52:42,319
You're alive, and you're here.

1127
01:52:43,355 --> 01:52:45,289
And I love you.

1128
01:53:57,496 --> 01:54:01,532
<i>I don't worry</i>

1129
01:54:01,567 --> 01:54:05,954
<i>Whenever skies
Are gray above</i>

1130
01:54:05,989 --> 01:54:09,866
<i>Gotta pocketful of rainbows</i>

1131
01:54:09,901 --> 01:54:13,743
<i>Gotta a heart full of love</i>

1132
01:54:19,051 --> 01:54:22,987
<i>Mister heartache</i>

1133
01:54:23,022 --> 01:54:27,470
<i>I found a way
To make you believe</i>

1134
01:54:27,505 --> 01:54:31,919
<i>Gotta a pocketful of rainbows</i>

1135
01:54:37,503 --> 01:54:39,698
Happy birthday honey!

1136
01:54:40,973 --> 01:54:44,593
<i>Kiss me extra tender</i>

1137
01:54:44,628 --> 01:54:48,179
<i>Hold me extra tight</i>

1138
01:54:48,214 --> 01:54:52,017
<i>'Cause I'm saving
Your sweetness</i>

1139
01:54:52,052 --> 01:54:56,622
<i>For a lonely night</i>

1140
01:54:56,657 --> 01:55:01,158
<i>No more teardrops</i>

1141
01:55:01,193 --> 01:55:07,132
<i>Now that I found a love so true</i>

1142
01:55:07,167 --> 01:55:08,861
Honey...

1143
01:55:09,902 --> 01:55:13,303
It's not easy finding a watch
with a Ferris Wheel, you know.

1144
01:55:19,411 --> 01:55:21,208
So, you like it?

1145
01:55:22,481 --> 01:55:24,073
Of course I like it.

1146
01:56:09,628 --> 01:56:14,832
- You see?
- Yeah, sort of...

1147
01:56:14,867 --> 01:56:19,338
One of this will help you
to become a manager.

1148
01:56:19,373 --> 01:56:21,340
That's what it make.

1149
01:56:21,375 --> 01:56:23,103
Eddie?

1150
01:56:24,276 --> 01:56:26,245
- Oh, hello, Joe.
- Marguerite...

1151
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:27,945
Hey, honey.

1152
01:56:27,980 --> 01:56:29,982
When did you start to work
at the old pier?

1153
01:56:30,017 --> 01:56:31,882
It's just a part time.

1154
01:56:31,917 --> 01:56:33,919
Joe is managing to
make me a manager.

1155
01:56:33,954 --> 01:56:36,922
- Ain't it swell?
- Ain't nothing.

1156
01:56:36,957 --> 01:56:38,889
Oh that's great, Joe.

1157
01:56:38,924 --> 01:56:43,562
Hey, Eddie come out here
for a second, will you?

1158
01:56:43,597 --> 01:56:45,553
Back to the force.

1159
01:56:53,939 --> 01:56:57,602
Happy birthday,
Mr. Eddie!

1160
01:57:53,699 --> 01:57:56,167
I could never wear
something like that.

1161
01:57:57,202 --> 01:57:59,727
If you did, the fellas wouldn't
look at anyone else.

1162
01:58:18,791 --> 01:58:20,315
Eddie?

1163
01:58:21,560 --> 01:58:23,619
Eddie!

1164
01:59:35,234 --> 01:59:39,536
- You got the card?
- Card?

1165
01:59:39,571 --> 01:59:43,769
- The insurance card.
- Yeah, I got it.

1166
01:59:53,285 --> 01:59:54,980
Wait here, I get you.

1167
02:00:16,642 --> 02:00:17,336
Thanks.

1168
02:00:21,513 --> 02:00:24,846
Look... I see it from here.

1169
02:00:27,019 --> 02:00:29,010
What honey?
The ferris wheel?

1170
02:00:30,956 --> 02:00:33,390
Home...

1171
02:00:51,443 --> 02:00:53,468
Want some water?

1172
02:00:56,949 --> 02:00:59,281
Here...
here, take some.

1173
02:01:00,218 --> 02:01:02,243
It's good for you to have water.

1174
02:02:55,734 --> 02:02:57,565
You're my fourth person?

1175
02:03:07,612 --> 02:03:09,580
For the bitter and the sweet.

1176
02:03:15,954 --> 02:03:18,047
For the bitter and the sweet.

1177
02:03:23,895 --> 02:03:25,886
For the bitter and the sweet?

1178
02:03:32,804 --> 02:03:34,999
For the bitter and the sweet.

1179
02:03:44,716 --> 02:03:46,411
It can't be...

1180
02:03:51,490 --> 02:03:53,890
Can it be... Marguerite?

1181
02:03:58,096 --> 02:04:00,428
For the bitter and the sweet?

1182
02:04:14,513 --> 02:04:17,482
Your hair. It's white.

1183
02:04:22,220 --> 02:04:25,857
I can't stop staring.
I'm sorry.

1184
02:04:25,892 --> 02:04:28,325
Eddie.

1185
02:04:28,360 --> 02:04:31,124
Have you forgotten so quickly
what I look like?

1186
02:04:32,430 --> 02:04:33,761
I never forgot that.

1187
02:04:38,537 --> 02:04:42,706
All weddings.
That was my choice.

1188
02:04:42,741 --> 02:04:46,510
I can go from one to another,
all over the world.

1189
02:04:46,545 --> 02:04:50,282
When the groom lifts the veil,
when the bride takes the ring...

1190
02:04:50,317 --> 02:04:52,249
it never changes.

1191
02:04:52,284 --> 02:04:56,152
They always believe their love
will break all the records.

1192
02:04:59,291 --> 02:05:01,660
Did we have that
at our wedding?

1193
02:05:01,695 --> 02:05:03,628
We had an accordion player.

1194
02:05:11,937 --> 02:05:13,436
Your leg...

1195
02:05:13,471 --> 02:05:16,338
It's getting worse, it was
good when I got here.

1196
02:05:17,809 --> 02:05:21,513
So... you... went through
this whole thing, too?

1197
02:05:21,548 --> 02:05:24,316
- You met five people?
- Yes.

1198
02:05:24,351 --> 02:05:26,116
And it made a difference?

1199
02:05:26,151 --> 02:05:27,881
It made all the difference.

1200
02:05:29,487 --> 02:05:31,546
And then I came here
to wait for you.

1201
02:05:34,459 --> 02:05:36,222
My sweetheart.

1202
02:05:37,863 --> 02:05:41,765
How much do you know
since you died?

1203
02:05:41,800 --> 02:05:43,435
Well, I remember everything
that happened...

1204
02:05:43,470 --> 02:05:45,035
when we were together.

1205
02:05:45,070 --> 02:05:46,901
And now I know why it happened.

1206
02:05:48,907 --> 02:05:51,341
And I know that you
loved me dearly.

1207
02:05:55,647 --> 02:05:57,706
But I don't know
how you died.

1208
02:06:00,585 --> 02:06:04,389
There was this little girl.
One of the rides a new one...

1209
02:06:04,424 --> 02:06:05,922
not like the ones
we used to have...

1210
02:06:05,957 --> 02:06:08,525
everything goes a million
miles an hour now...

1211
02:06:08,560 --> 02:06:12,264
but this ride, I never trusted
it, it drops a cart, see...

1212
02:06:12,299 --> 02:06:14,216
and somehow the cable,
it snapped...

1213
02:06:14,251 --> 02:06:16,099
I don't know how,
it just snapped...

1214
02:06:16,134 --> 02:06:17,869
and this little girl,
she was underneath it...

1215
02:06:17,904 --> 02:06:19,237
and I went to push her
out of the way...

1216
02:06:19,272 --> 02:06:22,340
I grabbed her hands, and then...

1217
02:06:22,375 --> 02:06:23,640
that's all I remember...

1218
02:06:23,675 --> 02:06:28,313
I felt her little hands and
then everything went black.

1219
02:06:28,348 --> 02:06:32,117
I tried, I tried, but I don't
know...

1220
02:06:32,152 --> 02:06:34,642
if I failed...

1221
02:06:36,021 --> 02:06:38,490
I ain't talked this much
since I been here.

1222
02:06:38,525 --> 02:06:40,287
Oh, God, Marguerite...

1223
02:06:41,726 --> 02:06:44,261
I can't say...

1224
02:06:44,296 --> 02:06:46,797
I can't say...

1225
02:06:50,101 --> 02:06:52,797
- What?
- I missed you so much.

1226
02:07:33,745 --> 02:07:37,112
I'm a soldier.

1227
02:07:38,616 --> 02:07:40,982
I'm a soldier.

1228
02:07:53,231 --> 02:07:55,732
Are you OK, Eddie?

1229
02:07:55,767 --> 02:07:58,570
Yeah...
it's nothing, honey...

1230
02:07:58,605 --> 02:08:00,561
That dream again?

1231
02:08:03,641 --> 02:08:05,275
You want me
to fix you something?

1232
02:08:05,310 --> 02:08:09,214
- It's four in the morning.
- It's all right I don't mind...

1233
02:08:09,249 --> 02:08:11,307
Get some sleep, honey...

1234
02:08:37,876 --> 02:08:39,776
What happened
during the war?

1235
02:08:42,680 --> 02:08:46,049
- You never told me.
- I couldn't tell you.

1236
02:08:46,084 --> 02:08:49,247
We had to survive. We did
what we had to do, I guess.

1237
02:08:50,755 --> 02:08:53,757
But I was never the same.
It was like...

1238
02:08:53,792 --> 02:08:56,394
all the things I had wanted,
I couldn't see 'em anymore.

1239
02:08:56,429 --> 02:08:58,997
I felt stuck... I should have
made us a better life.

1240
02:08:59,032 --> 02:09:00,965
I should of gotten us
out of there, the pier...

1241
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:02,956
I loved the pier.

1242
02:09:04,135 --> 02:09:06,404
I lost myself...

1243
02:09:06,439 --> 02:09:08,540
I'm sorry.

1244
02:09:08,575 --> 02:09:10,440
No.

1245
02:09:14,279 --> 02:09:16,042
Marguerite?

1246
02:09:17,582 --> 02:09:20,452
Do you think God
knows I'm here?

1247
02:09:20,487 --> 02:09:21,976
Of course.

1248
02:09:23,254 --> 02:09:25,321
Why do you ask?

1249
02:09:25,356 --> 02:09:28,689
I dunno. I guess part of my life
I was hiding from him...

1250
02:09:30,295 --> 02:09:32,629
And the rest?

1251
02:09:32,664 --> 02:09:35,633
The rest I just figured
he didn't know I existed.

1252
02:09:48,012 --> 02:09:50,139
The wine, wine's good, huh?

1253
02:10:03,061 --> 02:10:05,864
Were you sorry about anything?

1254
02:10:05,899 --> 02:10:08,059
With us, I mean?

1255
02:10:16,107 --> 02:10:18,803
I was sorry we couldn't
have children.

1256
02:10:32,190 --> 02:10:34,181
We had lots of 'em
around, though.

1257
02:10:36,227 --> 02:10:38,024
And you?

1258
02:10:39,364 --> 02:10:41,992
Were you sorry about
anything with us?

1259
02:10:53,178 --> 02:10:56,011
Yeah. I was sorry
it didn't last longer.

1260
02:11:17,035 --> 02:11:19,503
- I'll make some tea.
- I'll get it.

1261
02:14:55,853 --> 02:14:59,448
You had to live without love
for many years didn't you?

1262
02:15:00,658 --> 02:15:02,990
You felt that it was
snatched away.

1263
02:15:04,061 --> 02:15:06,547
That I left you too soon.

1264
02:15:06,582 --> 02:15:08,998
You did leave too soon.

1265
02:15:09,033 --> 02:15:11,569
There was a reason to it all.

1266
02:15:11,604 --> 02:15:13,436
What reason?
You died.

1267
02:15:13,471 --> 02:15:14,672
You died and
you lost everything...

1268
02:15:14,707 --> 02:15:15,705
And I lost everything...

1269
02:15:15,740 --> 02:15:16,874
I lost the only woman
I ever loved.

1270
02:15:16,909 --> 02:15:18,933
No you didn't.

1271
02:15:19,977 --> 02:15:21,672
I was right here.

1272
02:15:23,481 --> 02:15:25,779
And you loved me anyhow.

1273
02:15:27,718 --> 02:15:30,243
Lost love is still love, Eddie.

1274
02:15:31,289 --> 02:15:33,689
It takes a different form,
that's all.

1275
02:15:35,426 --> 02:15:37,553
You can't hold their hands...

1276
02:15:39,263 --> 02:15:40,787
you can't tousle their hair.

1277
02:15:43,734 --> 02:15:47,261
But when those senses weaken,
another one comes to life.

1278
02:15:48,406 --> 02:15:50,907
Memory.

1279
02:15:50,942 --> 02:15:56,280
Memory becomes your partner.
You hold it.

1280
02:15:56,315 --> 02:15:58,407
You dance with it.

1281
02:16:00,585 --> 02:16:03,076
Life has to end, Eddie.

1282
02:16:04,655 --> 02:16:07,156
Love doesn't.

1283
02:16:07,191 --> 02:16:09,192
- I never wanted anyone else.
- I know.

1284
02:16:09,227 --> 02:16:11,923
- I'm still in love with you.
- I know. I felt it.

1285
02:16:13,364 --> 02:16:15,229
You felt it? Here?

1286
02:16:16,400 --> 02:16:18,300
Even here.

1287
02:16:25,510 --> 02:16:27,808
I want to show you something.

1288
02:16:50,368 --> 02:16:52,427
I was saving this one.

1289
02:17:17,028 --> 02:17:19,155
Dance with me, Eddie.

1290
02:17:52,496 --> 02:17:54,225
May I ask you something?

1291
02:17:56,133 --> 02:17:58,536
How come you look
the way you looked...

1292
02:17:58,571 --> 02:18:00,401
the day I married you?

1293
02:18:01,772 --> 02:18:04,673
Because I thought you
would like it this way.

1294
02:18:06,010 --> 02:18:09,280
Can you change it?

1295
02:18:09,315 --> 02:18:12,550
Change it? To what?

1296
02:18:12,585 --> 02:18:14,381
To the end.

1297
02:18:16,187 --> 02:18:20,124
But I wasn't so pretty
at the end.

1298
02:18:20,159 --> 02:18:22,058
Can you?

1299
02:19:23,854 --> 02:19:27,483
I don't want go on.
I want to stay here.

1300
02:19:39,303 --> 02:19:40,836
No...

1301
02:19:40,871 --> 02:19:42,839
Not yet...

1302
02:19:47,878 --> 02:19:53,551
Don't take her again!
Don't take her again!

1303
02:19:53,586 --> 02:19:55,951
Don't take her again!

1304
02:21:50,601 --> 02:21:52,398
Tala.

1305
02:22:01,779 --> 02:22:03,474
Tala.

1306
02:22:05,749 --> 02:22:07,649
Tala?

1307
02:22:13,190 --> 02:22:14,851
Baro.

1308
02:22:17,828 --> 02:22:19,159
Baro.

1309
02:22:25,603 --> 02:22:27,300
Saya.

1310
02:22:27,335 --> 02:22:28,998
Saya.

1311
02:22:34,511 --> 02:22:36,544
Loser.

1312
02:22:36,579 --> 02:22:38,577
Loser.

1313
02:22:45,289 --> 02:22:46,950
Washing.

1314
02:22:49,460 --> 02:22:51,758
Washing.
Like our Inas do.

1315
02:22:53,430 --> 02:22:55,091
Inas?

1316
02:22:56,433 --> 02:22:58,367
Mommies.

1317
02:22:58,402 --> 02:23:00,495
Where are your Mommies?

1318
02:23:08,279 --> 02:23:11,747
These?
These are pipe cleaners.

1319
02:23:11,782 --> 02:23:14,919
I keep 'em for
the kids at the Pier.

1320
02:23:14,954 --> 02:23:16,580
Here...

1321
02:23:30,234 --> 02:23:31,826
Look, see...

1322
02:23:41,011 --> 02:23:42,638
There.

1323
02:23:50,788 --> 02:23:52,449
You like that, huh?

1324
02:23:54,558 --> 02:23:56,355
You burn me.

1325
02:23:59,129 --> 02:24:01,196
What did you say?

1326
02:24:01,231 --> 02:24:05,065
You burn me.
You make me fire.

1327
02:24:06,737 --> 02:24:08,762
I don't understand...

1328
02:24:11,575 --> 02:24:15,980
My Ina say hide.
Hide in nipa.

1329
02:24:16,015 --> 02:24:19,515
My Ina say she come back.

1330
02:24:19,550 --> 02:24:21,986
What were you hiding from,
little girl?

1331
02:24:22,021 --> 02:24:23,817
Sundalong.

1332
02:24:26,123 --> 02:24:27,681
Soldier.

1333
02:24:29,460 --> 02:24:30,950
Come out!

1334
02:24:31,929 --> 02:24:33,920
I'm a soldier!

1335
02:24:36,500 --> 02:24:38,263
Tala...

1336
02:24:41,038 --> 02:24:42,903
Why are you in Heaven?

1337
02:24:43,941 --> 02:24:48,344
You burn me
you make me fire.

1338
02:24:54,251 --> 02:24:57,220
You were the shadow...
the shadow in the hut...

1339
02:25:03,727 --> 02:25:06,355
Ina say she come back.

1340
02:25:07,464 --> 02:25:10,160
Ina say Tala be safe.

1341
02:25:14,571 --> 02:25:18,200
You burn me.
Not safe.

1342
02:25:33,490 --> 02:25:37,893
Oh, God, oh no...

1343
02:25:41,031 --> 02:25:43,795
I killed you...
I killed you...

1344
02:25:45,769 --> 02:25:48,738
Forgive me dear Lord,
forgive me...

1345
02:25:52,042 --> 02:25:53,737
all this time...

1346
02:25:54,812 --> 02:25:56,677
those dreams.

1347
02:25:59,983 --> 02:26:02,284
Forgive me!
I didn't know...

1348
02:26:02,319 --> 02:26:06,356
I didn't know...
I didn't know...

1349
02:26:06,391 --> 02:26:08,415
why didn't I know...

1350
02:26:16,100 --> 02:26:20,036
No... No...

1351
02:26:44,595 --> 02:26:46,688
You wash me.

1352
02:27:11,255 --> 02:27:13,120
You wash me.

1353
02:27:14,925 --> 02:27:17,359
You wash me like Inas do.

1354
02:27:21,064 --> 02:27:23,032
I don't know how...

1355
02:28:49,319 --> 02:28:50,843
Five.

1356
02:28:51,922 --> 02:28:53,355
Five?

1357
02:28:54,891 --> 02:28:57,052
You're five years old?

1358
02:29:04,034 --> 02:29:06,059
You're my fifth person...

1359
02:29:18,348 --> 02:29:20,145
Why are you sad?

1360
02:29:21,718 --> 02:29:23,310
Why am I sad?

1361
02:29:24,388 --> 02:29:26,379
Where? Here?

1362
02:29:28,258 --> 02:29:30,283
On Earth?

1363
02:29:32,629 --> 02:29:34,663
I was sad because...

1364
02:29:34,698 --> 02:29:38,035
I didn't do anything
with my life.

1365
02:29:38,070 --> 02:29:40,102
Because...

1366
02:29:40,137 --> 02:29:45,709
I always felt trapped by
the things that happened...

1367
02:29:45,744 --> 02:29:48,211
I wasn't where
I was supposed to be.

1368
02:29:48,246 --> 02:29:50,202
Do you understand that?

1369
02:29:51,581 --> 02:29:54,311
It is where
you supposed to be.

1370
02:29:56,653 --> 02:29:59,713
Where? Ruby Pier?
Fixing rides?

1371
02:30:01,658 --> 02:30:03,625
Why?

1372
02:30:03,660 --> 02:30:05,924
Why was I supposed
to be there?

1373
02:30:07,798 --> 02:30:12,119
Children.
You keep them safe.

1374
02:30:12,154 --> 02:30:16,440
You make good for me.
Every day.

1375
02:30:16,475 --> 02:30:18,806
You make good for me.

1376
02:30:21,311 --> 02:30:25,215
Is where you are
supposed to be...

1377
02:30:25,250 --> 02:30:27,479
Eddie Main'nance.

1378
02:30:35,092 --> 02:30:37,759
- Tala?
- Tala.

1379
02:30:37,794 --> 02:30:40,897
There was a little girl.
At the pier. The day I died.

1380
02:30:40,932 --> 02:30:42,421
Do you know who
I'm talking about?

1381
02:30:43,467 --> 02:30:46,436
Did I save her? Just tell me.
Did I pull her out of the way?

1382
02:30:51,174 --> 02:30:56,126
No pull. Push.
You push her away.

1383
02:30:56,161 --> 02:31:01,078
Big thing fall.
You keep her safe.

1384
02:31:02,119 --> 02:31:05,487
No... I felt her hands...

1385
02:31:05,522 --> 02:31:08,548
I couldn't have pushed...
I felt her little hands...

1386
02:31:10,794 --> 02:31:13,597
Not her hands.

1387
02:31:13,632 --> 02:31:15,588
My hands.

1388
02:31:19,636 --> 02:31:22,539
I bring you to heaven.

1389
02:31:22,574 --> 02:31:24,234
Keep you safe.

1390
02:32:29,773 --> 02:32:33,106
<i>All the accidents
Eddie had prevented...</i>

1391
02:32:34,611 --> 02:32:37,705
<i>all the lives
he had kept safe.</i>

1392
02:32:38,815 --> 02:32:40,806
<i>He saw them all.</i>

1393
02:32:41,885 --> 02:32:43,852
<i>And all their children...</i>

1394
02:32:43,887 --> 02:32:46,378
<i>and all their
children's children...</i>

1395
02:32:47,524 --> 02:32:51,790
<i>there because of the simple
things that he did...</i>

1396
02:32:53,997 --> 02:32:56,557
<i>day after day.</i>

1397
02:34:28,758 --> 02:34:32,329
<i>This is the story
of a man named Eddie...</i>

1398
02:34:32,364 --> 02:34:35,597
<i>who lived and died...</i>

1399
02:34:35,632 --> 02:34:40,092
<i>and would one day himself
share the secret of heaven:</i>

1400
02:34:44,574 --> 02:34:47,737
<i>That each life
affects the other...</i>

1401
02:34:50,513 --> 02:34:53,175
<i>and the other
affects the next...</i>

1402
02:35:32,956 --> 02:35:35,875
<i>and the world
is full of stories...</i>

1403
02:35:35,910 --> 02:35:38,794
<i>but the stories
are all one.</i>
