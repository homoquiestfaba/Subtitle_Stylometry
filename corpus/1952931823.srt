We are high priests. Warlocks.

4
00:00:16,177 --> 00:00:19,579
We're Vatican assassins.

5
00:00:19,647 --> 00:00:22,182
This rock star
must make them weep.

6
00:00:27,788 --> 00:00:31,858

10
00:00:51,445 --> 00:00:54,114
brought to you
by Axe body spray

and <i>FIFA Soccer 12.</i>

12
00:00:56,917 --> 00:01:00,353
And now, please welcome
your roastmaster,

13
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:02,589
Seth MacFarlane.

14
00:01:09,063 --> 00:01:11,865
Ladies and gentlemen...

15
00:01:15,236 --> 00:01:16,269
Thank you.

16
00:01:16,337 --> 00:01:17,971
Thank you very much.

17
00:01:18,038 --> 00:01:19,706
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

18
00:01:19,774 --> 00:01:21,207
I'm Seth MacFarlane,

19
00:01:21,275 --> 00:01:24,310
and, yes, the big night
is finally here.

20
00:01:24,378 --> 00:01:28,314
Welcome to the <i>Comedy Central</i>
<i>Roast of Charlie Sheen.</i>

21
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,655
Yes, we're here tonight
to honor and hopefully arrest

22
00:01:35,723 --> 00:01:40,084
a man who was great
in two things 25 years ago,

23
00:01:40,153 --> 00:01:41,549
Charlie Sheen.

24
00:01:42,693 --> 00:01:45,054
Actually,
there's a lot of Sheen on TV

25
00:01:45,121 --> 00:01:46,175
this evening
when this show airs.

26
00:01:46,243 --> 00:01:47,877
Tonight on <i>Two and a Half Men,</i>

27
00:01:47,945 --> 00:01:50,279
they're actually having
Charlie's pretend funeral,

28
00:01:50,347 --> 00:01:51,414
believe it or not.

29
00:01:51,482 --> 00:01:52,915
There's no need
to switch over, though.

30
00:01:52,983 --> 00:01:53,549
Just wait a few months.

31
00:01:53,669 --> 00:01:55,288
You can probably
see the real thing.

32
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:03,180
I mean, we all know
there's a good chance

33
00:02:03,247 --> 00:02:04,681
Charlie will be dead soon,

34
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:07,984
so I wrote an o--
an obituary.

35
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:13,923
"Charlie Sheen,
who became a tabloid fixture

36
00:02:13,991 --> 00:02:16,393
"due to his problems
with drugs and alcohol,

37
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,361
was found dead
in his apartment--"

38
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,896
Actually, you know what?

39
00:02:19,964 --> 00:02:23,956
I kind of actually just copied
Amy Winehouse's obituary.

40
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:27,737
It's--it's--I only had
to change three things, though.

41
00:02:27,805 --> 00:02:30,106
The sex of the deceased,
the location of the body,

42
00:02:30,174 --> 00:02:33,143
and the part that says,
"a talent that will be missed."

43
00:02:38,182 --> 00:02:42,652
We love Charlie!

44
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,120
All right.
So I know Tyson's

45
00:02:44,188 --> 00:02:45,288
not gonna kick
the shit out of me.

46
00:02:45,356 --> 00:02:47,023
That's good news.

47
00:02:47,091 --> 00:02:49,426
So we're gonna take a few pokes
at him here tonight,

48
00:02:49,493 --> 00:02:53,029
but there is no denying
that Charlie Sheen is an icon.

49
00:02:53,097 --> 00:02:55,865
You've seen him on TV.
You've seen him in movies.

50
00:02:55,933 --> 00:02:57,233
And if you're a prostitute,

51
00:02:57,301 --> 00:02:58,768
you've seen him point
a gun at your face

52
00:02:58,836 --> 00:03:00,136
while you try to get him hard.

53
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,275
Let's take a look back
at the work

54
00:03:05,342 --> 00:03:07,510
that paid for all that cocaine.

55
00:03:09,413 --> 00:03:14,084
Gentlemen...
He's back.

56
00:03:14,151 --> 00:03:15,051
Hey, buddy.

57
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:16,986
And they're off and running.

58
00:03:17,054 --> 00:03:18,688
Now cool off.

59
00:03:18,756 --> 00:03:21,091
Oh, I am cool.

60
00:03:21,158 --> 00:03:23,193
You should see me when I'm hot.

61
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,462
What are you looking at?

62
00:03:25,529 --> 00:03:27,797
What are you smiling at, huh?

63
00:03:27,865 --> 00:03:29,532
How many yachts
can you water-ski behind?

64
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,468
How much is enough?

65
00:03:31,535 --> 00:03:33,103
- I am your daughter.
- No, you're not.

66
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,871
- Aah!
- Gah!

67

"Are too" times ten.

70
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,010
Tiger blood.
Yes, it's real.

71
00:03:41,078 --> 00:03:42,278

- Sure.
- Drugs?

00:04:09,907 --> 00:04:11,374

we are unable

with the drinking
and the hookers and the drugs

101
00:04:49,013 --> 00:04:50,513
and the hookers.

102
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:51,848
Ugh.
You're such a pig.

103
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,316
You know, usually
I have to date a woman

104
00:04:53,384 --> 00:04:54,984
before she treats me this way.

105
00:04:55,052 --> 00:04:56,586
There's my life.
Deal with it.

106
00:04:56,654 --> 00:04:58,988
It's on. Bring it.
Winning. Buh-bye.

107
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:07,864
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

108
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,545
it's time to bring out
the man of the hour.

109
00:05:09,665 --> 00:05:11,901
He went from
<i>Ferris Bueller's Day Off</i>

110
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:14,103
to having every day off.

111
00:05:14,171 --> 00:05:16,639
Please welcome
the rock star from Mars,

112
00:05:16,707 --> 00:05:18,341
Charlie Sheen.

113
00:05:56,347 --> 00:05:57,847
Wow. Wow!

114
00:05:57,915 --> 00:06:00,183
Wow! Wow!

115
00:06:04,021 --> 00:06:07,357
Wow.
Wow, wow, wow.

116
00:06:07,424 --> 00:06:10,159
Wow.

117
00:06:10,227 --> 00:06:12,128
Unbelievable.
Thank you. Thank you.

118
00:06:12,196 --> 00:06:14,063
Have fun.

119
00:06:14,131 --> 00:06:15,765
Slash!

120
00:06:18,602 --> 00:06:21,571
- How are you, Seth?
- Charlie.

121
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:23,973
Ahh.
Thank you.

122
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,075
There he sits,
the man of the hour.

123
00:06:26,143 --> 00:06:28,611
Charlie, you claim
to have tiger blood,

124
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,713
but with all the porn stars
you've banged,

125
00:06:30,781 --> 00:06:32,448
it's probably just
Tiger Woods' blood,

126
00:06:32,516 --> 00:06:34,417
I'm guessing.

127
00:06:38,923 --> 00:06:40,924
You have a lot of nicknames
for yourself.

128
00:06:40,991 --> 00:06:42,258
You say you're
a Vatican assassin,

129
00:06:42,326 --> 00:06:43,593
whatever that is.

130
00:06:43,661 --> 00:06:45,161
Charlie, the Vatican
does not have assassins.

131
00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:46,296
No.

132
00:06:46,363 --> 00:06:47,463
If they want
to shut someone up,

133
00:06:47,531 --> 00:06:48,998
they just buy 'em ice cream

134
00:06:49,066 --> 00:06:50,833
and tell 'em if they talk,
Jesus will kill their parents.

135
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,108
Now, as you may know,

136
00:06:59,176 --> 00:07:01,210
Charlie Sheen
is not his birth name.

137
00:07:01,278 --> 00:07:05,114
His original Spanish name
is señor drugs.

138
00:07:07,384 --> 00:07:08,651
Kidding aside, though,

139
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:11,020
Carlos Estevez
took his dad's name,

140
00:07:11,088 --> 00:07:13,790
yes, to gain credibility
as an actor.

141
00:07:13,857 --> 00:07:15,558
I've seen your films,

142
00:07:15,626 --> 00:07:17,493
and you don't really act
like a Sheen.

143
00:07:17,561 --> 00:07:18,928
But, you know,
with your rap sheet

144
00:07:18,996 --> 00:07:20,463
and briefcases of coke,

145
00:07:20,531 --> 00:07:22,732
you're definitely
acting like a Carlos.

146
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:27,003
Charlie went on
to star in TV and film,

147
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,604
both drama and comedy.

148
00:07:28,672 --> 00:07:30,273
He was the star of <i>Hot Shots...</i>

149
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,445
Which is also
what Charlie feels

150
00:07:35,512 --> 00:07:37,080
when he takes a piss.

151
00:07:40,017 --> 00:07:42,118
I really think you
and Emilio should do a follow-up

152
00:07:42,186 --> 00:07:43,720
to the movie <i>Men at Work,</i>

153
00:07:43,787 --> 00:07:45,688
and you can call it
"Men Who Don't Work Anymore."

154
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,457
Right?
That would be...

155
00:07:47,524 --> 00:07:49,826
I'll help--
I'll help you write that.

156
00:07:49,893 --> 00:07:52,328
But, uh, of course
a very public meltdown

157
00:07:52,396 --> 00:07:53,463
changed the landscape.

158
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:54,864
It's interesting,

159
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,733
when you think about
the firing of Charlie Sheen

160
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,634
tells you all you really
need to know about Hollywood.

161
00:07:58,702 --> 00:08:01,204
You can abuse drugs.
You can abuse your spouse.

162
00:08:01,271 --> 00:08:02,872
You can trash hotel rooms.

163
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,407
You can solicit prostitutes.

164
00:08:04,475 --> 00:08:06,542
But don't you ever, ever
call a Jewish guy

165
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:09,679
by his actual Jewish name.

166
00:08:18,255 --> 00:08:21,824
So, now Charlie
is a self-contained unit.

167
00:08:21,892 --> 00:08:25,261
He is dependent upon no man
and no thing...

168
00:08:25,329 --> 00:08:28,264
Except crack, jack, crank,
meth, ludes,

169
00:08:28,332 --> 00:08:29,732
Vicodin, blow, acid,
uppers, poppers,

170
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,000
"E," nitrous, dust, hash,

171
00:08:31,068 --> 00:08:35,538
and this one boner medicine
from Norway.

172
00:08:35,606 --> 00:08:37,707
He's the reason
a dick with cocaine on it

173
00:08:37,775 --> 00:08:40,043
is called a "sheenis."

174
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,914
Wow.

175
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,682
Wow.

176
00:08:51,622 --> 00:08:53,389
He's still with us,
Charlie Sheen.

177
00:08:53,457 --> 00:08:56,459
In fact, Charlie just celebrated
his 46th birthday...

178
00:08:56,527 --> 00:08:58,361
Thank you.

179
00:08:58,429 --> 00:09:01,330
Thank you.

180
00:09:01,398 --> 00:09:03,933
A statement no one thought
we would ever hear--

181
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:08,704
kind of like,
"Get Jeselnik on the phone."

182
00:09:08,772 --> 00:09:10,873
Or...

183
00:09:10,941 --> 00:09:15,912
Or "Jeff Ross'll pay for it."

184
00:09:15,979 --> 00:09:19,115
Or Jon Lovitz saying,
"one [bleep] at a time, please."

185
00:09:27,758 --> 00:09:30,093
Charlie allegedly
made a prostitute cry

186
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,861
at the Plaza hotel.

187
00:09:31,929 --> 00:09:33,429
I want to tell you though,
Charlie, I think she's lying.

188
00:09:33,497 --> 00:09:34,697
'Cause I saw the scene

189
00:09:34,765 --> 00:09:36,032
where you got arrested
in <i>Wall Street.</i>

190
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,700
You can't even
make yourself cry.

191
00:09:44,508 --> 00:09:47,043
But, you know, with all those
"Dangerous Jobs" shows on TV,

192
00:09:47,111 --> 00:09:49,479
like the ones about crab
fishing, ice-road trucking,

193
00:09:49,546 --> 00:09:51,147
why is there no show

194
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,316
about the most dangerous
job out there--

195
00:09:53,383 --> 00:09:56,786
Being an escort
for Charlie Sheen?

196
00:09:56,854 --> 00:09:59,188
How long must we wait
for the first season

197
00:09:59,256 --> 00:10:00,389
of <i>Deadliest Snatch?</i>

198
00:10:00,457 --> 00:10:01,557
I'm ready to see that right--

199
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:04,827
right now.

200
00:10:06,663 --> 00:10:07,997
Honestly, Charlie,

201
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,866
I never thought
I would live to see the night

202
00:10:09,933 --> 00:10:11,334
that you would live
to see this night.

203
00:10:11,401 --> 00:10:13,436
I really didn't.

204
00:10:13,504 --> 00:10:18,241
And now our first roaster,
Jon Lovitz.

205
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:23,179
He was one of the stars
of a <i>Saturday Night Live</i> cast

206
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:26,916
that the critics have hailed
as "not the worst."

207
00:10:26,984 --> 00:10:29,218
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome the star

208
00:10:29,286 --> 00:10:30,920
of "Two and a Half Chins,"

209
00:10:30,988 --> 00:10:32,855
one of my favorite
<i>SNL</i> comics ever,

210
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,457
Jon Lovitz.

211
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:50,473
Thank you for that
introduction, Seth MacFarlane.

212
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,241
Anyway, I am Jon Lovitz,

213
00:10:52,309 --> 00:10:54,377
although I think most of you
know me by my stage name--

214
00:10:54,444 --> 00:10:56,212
J-Lo.

215
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,780
Thank you.

216
00:10:57,848 --> 00:10:59,248
Well, look at this dais.

217
00:10:59,316 --> 00:11:00,449
Mike Tyson is here.

218
00:11:00,517 --> 00:11:01,784
Yes, sir.

219
00:11:01,852 --> 00:11:04,187
You know, his boxing nickname
is iron Mike,

220
00:11:04,254 --> 00:11:06,389
which is what the guards
used to scream at him

221
00:11:06,456 --> 00:11:08,157
in the prison laundry.

222
00:11:08,225 --> 00:11:11,994
I don't do that anymore, Jon.

223
00:11:12,062 --> 00:11:13,462
Well, I know
you don't do that anymore.

224
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,464
You're not in prison anymore.

225
00:11:15,532 --> 00:11:18,234
Just making it clear.

226
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:25,074
He's funny.

227
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,176
Hey, how did Amy Schumer
get here?

228
00:11:27,244 --> 00:11:29,879
I'd ask whose [bleep]
she sucked to get on the dais,

229
00:11:29,947 --> 00:11:31,781
but she's dating
Anthony Jeselnik,

230
00:11:31,848 --> 00:11:34,016
so I'll just ask him.

231
00:11:34,084 --> 00:11:38,154
Anthony, whose [bleep] did
Amy suck to get on the dais?

232
00:11:40,123 --> 00:11:42,225
Who else is--
Oh, hello, Steve-O.

233
00:11:42,292 --> 00:11:43,192
Yes, sir.

234
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,027
Talked to Steve-O this morning.

235
00:11:45,095 --> 00:11:46,395
I said,
"How's your day going?"

236
00:11:46,463 --> 00:11:49,165
He said, "Great.
I woke up, took a big shit,

237
00:11:49,233 --> 00:11:51,667
then got out of bed...

238
00:11:55,205 --> 00:11:57,840
You know, unlike all
you people on this dais,

239
00:11:57,908 --> 00:11:59,742
I, uh--
I actually know Charlie,

240
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:03,045
and I'm famous.

241
00:12:03,113 --> 00:12:04,513
No, he's my friend.

242
00:12:04,581 --> 00:12:05,982
I've known him
for about 18 years,

243
00:12:06,049 --> 00:12:08,184
and I can tell you he's nothing
like the character

244
00:12:08,252 --> 00:12:11,754
he plays on <i>TMZ.</i>

245
00:12:11,822 --> 00:12:14,590
And people say,
"Oh, he's crazy,"

246
00:12:14,658 --> 00:12:16,459
you know, just because he likes
beautiful women

247
00:12:16,526 --> 00:12:20,029
to come to his house, have sex
with him, and then leave.

248
00:12:20,097 --> 00:12:22,164
What a nut.

249
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,070
First time I hung out
with Charlie

250
00:12:28,138 --> 00:12:30,006
was at his house
after the super bowl.

251
00:12:30,073 --> 00:12:31,707
Bunch of hot chicks
showed up, and...

252
00:12:31,775 --> 00:12:35,411
I looked up, I saw
my old girlfriend, and...

253
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:39,482
Charlie put his arm around me
and said, "Pick a hooker."

254
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:45,087
First time in my life I cried
and came at the same time.

255
00:12:45,155 --> 00:12:46,889
No, it wasn't.

256
00:12:49,926 --> 00:12:51,360
And now a joke.

257
00:12:51,428 --> 00:12:53,429
How much blow
can Charlie Sheen do?

258
00:12:53,497 --> 00:12:55,865
Enough to kill
<i>Two and a Half Men.</i>

259
00:13:03,607 --> 00:13:06,542
I'm kidding.
The man is misunderstood.

260
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,844
Eight-balls of hern--
bad for you?

261
00:13:08,912 --> 00:13:10,313
Or as Charlie sees it,

262
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,382
the most important
meal of the day.

263
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,484
Now, sure, things
got pretty crazy for a while.

264
00:13:15,552 --> 00:13:17,153
He was all mixed up.

265
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,688
But he knew it was time
to get straight

266
00:13:18,755 --> 00:13:20,189
when he put
his dick in his coke

267
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:22,858
and his razor in his hooker.

268
00:13:22,926 --> 00:13:24,960
And did you know Charlie's--

269
00:13:25,028 --> 00:13:26,929
according to the Torah,
he's Jewish?

270
00:13:26,997 --> 00:13:28,698
And not because
his mother's a Jew,

271
00:13:28,765 --> 00:13:30,766
but because CBS paid him
$50 million

272
00:13:30,834 --> 00:13:33,369
and he still sued the network.

273
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,277
Now, listen,
despite what you read,

274
00:13:41,345 --> 00:13:43,512
Charlie's still close
to all of his exes.

275
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,114
Why, well, just recently,

276
00:13:45,182 --> 00:13:47,149
he took Brooke Mueller
to Mexico...

277
00:13:47,217 --> 00:13:48,651
Where he banged her ass so hard

278
00:13:48,719 --> 00:13:50,586
three balloons of coke
fell out.

279
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:58,127
But Charlie's a gentleman.

280
00:13:58,195 --> 00:14:00,930
He put them back in.

281
00:14:04,334 --> 00:14:05,968
Picture it!

282
00:14:06,036 --> 00:14:08,070
Thank you.

283
00:14:13,844 --> 00:14:15,911
Coming up, Kate Walsh...

284
00:14:15,979 --> 00:14:19,348
Oh, Charlie, wait till you see
what the doctor's got in order.

285
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:22,017
Mike Tyson, Amy Schumer,
Jeff Ross...

286
00:14:22,085 --> 00:14:23,486
The real Gaddafi

287
00:14:23,553 --> 00:14:25,454
is hiding in Charlie Sheen's
nostrils right now.

288
00:14:25,522 --> 00:14:26,522
- Steve-O.
- Yeah.

289
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:27,623
Anthony Jeselnik...

290
00:14:27,691 --> 00:14:29,425
[Bleep] off.

291
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:30,659
William Shatner,

292
00:14:30,727 --> 00:14:33,562
Patrice O'Neal,
and Charlie Sheen.

293
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,231
Charlie, as you put it best,
it's just words.

294
00:14:41,554 --> 00:14:42,554
All right.

295
00:14:42,622 --> 00:14:45,257
Our next roaster is Kate Walsh.

296
00:14:48,695 --> 00:14:51,129
Why are you here?

297
00:14:51,197 --> 00:14:52,898
Let me say that it is a thrill

298
00:14:52,966 --> 00:14:56,735
to be around the hottest,
sexiest woman of 2002.

299
00:14:58,771 --> 00:15:01,707
Let's give a big round
of meno-plause

300
00:15:01,774 --> 00:15:04,776
for the beautiful
and talented Kate Walsh.

301
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,024
Seth MacFarlane,

302
00:15:19,092 --> 00:15:20,392
the only difference between you

303
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,461
and the hooker Charlie
locked in the closet

304
00:15:22,528 --> 00:15:24,596
is that the hooker
eventually came out.

305
00:15:33,706 --> 00:15:35,907
After years of playing
a doctor on <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>

306
00:15:35,975 --> 00:15:37,376
and <i>Private Practice,</i>

307
00:15:37,443 --> 00:15:39,111
people actually think
I'm a real doctor,

308
00:15:39,178 --> 00:15:40,612
so I figured, "[Bleep] it.

309
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,148
"I'm gonna start giving
some professional diagnoses

310
00:15:43,216 --> 00:15:45,417
to these people over here."

311
00:15:45,485 --> 00:15:48,086
For instance, Jeff Ross,

312
00:15:48,154 --> 00:15:49,755
your results have come back,

313
00:15:49,822 --> 00:15:51,456
and I'm going
to tell you something

314
00:15:51,524 --> 00:15:55,427
that you have never heard
about any of your TV pilots.

315
00:15:55,495 --> 00:15:59,297
You tested positive.

316
00:15:59,365 --> 00:16:01,933
Congratulations, Jeff.

317
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:03,568
And, Jeff, listen,

318
00:16:03,636 --> 00:16:05,537
I know you're concerned
about your complexion,

319
00:16:05,605 --> 00:16:07,639
but you have to stop
letting Mike Tyson

320
00:16:07,707 --> 00:16:10,575
[bleep] all over your face.

321
00:16:21,854 --> 00:16:23,221
He looks good.
I like the way he looks.

322
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:24,723
Thank you very much.

323
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:27,059
Anthony Jeselnik,
I don't normally do this,

324
00:16:27,126 --> 00:16:29,461
but I have to break
doctor-patient confidentiality.

325
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:30,929
Your results came back,

326
00:16:30,997 --> 00:16:33,398
and it turns out that
that embarrassing,

327
00:16:33,466 --> 00:16:35,467
nasty parasite on your penis

328
00:16:35,535 --> 00:16:37,335
is Amy Schumer.

329
00:16:40,406 --> 00:16:43,241
And there is no cure.

330
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:46,545
I'm so, so happy to see
that William Shatner is here,

331
00:16:46,612 --> 00:16:50,682
because a medical colleague
told me that you passed on.

332
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,118
I said, "Bullshit.
Have seen his resume?

333
00:16:53,186 --> 00:16:56,021
Shatner's never
passed on anything."

334
00:17:01,527 --> 00:17:03,528
Just wait.

335
00:17:05,498 --> 00:17:08,066
You look great.
I mean, your skin is so tight.

336
00:17:08,134 --> 00:17:09,701
I can't tell
if you've had a face-lift

337
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:11,837
or vaginal rejuvenation.

338
00:17:15,475 --> 00:17:17,776
Patrice O'Neal,
I understand you have diabetes,

339
00:17:17,844 --> 00:17:19,311
and as you know,

340
00:17:19,378 --> 00:17:22,314
this disease is very serious
and often linked to a poor diet.

341
00:17:22,381 --> 00:17:24,182
So my advice is simple.

342
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,552
Grape soda does not count
as a fruit.

343
00:17:29,288 --> 00:17:32,657
Mr. Sheen,
the doctor will see you now.

344
00:17:32,725 --> 00:17:34,426
I have to say, Charlie,

345
00:17:34,494 --> 00:17:36,495
you are an incredible
medical specimen.

346
00:17:36,562 --> 00:17:37,929
I guess that's
one of the benefits

347
00:17:37,997 --> 00:17:41,533
of waking up every morning
at the crack of crack.

348
00:17:45,238 --> 00:17:46,404
And, you know, it's amazing.

349
00:17:46,472 --> 00:17:48,406
Despite all those years
of abusing your lungs,

350
00:17:48,474 --> 00:17:49,841
your kidneys, your liver,

351
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:52,811
the only thing you've had
removed is your kids.

352
00:17:59,886 --> 00:18:03,054
Admittedly, Charlie gets
a little confused sometimes.

353
00:18:03,122 --> 00:18:04,523
He's the only guy
who pulls a knife

354
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:08,226
on a woman who's already
willing to [bleep] him.

355
00:18:11,931 --> 00:18:13,298
I'll drink to that.

356
00:18:13,366 --> 00:18:15,267
I'll drink to that.

357
00:18:15,334 --> 00:18:17,702
Michael, drink to that.

358
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:20,172
But is Charlie really
the worst guy here?

359
00:18:20,239 --> 00:18:22,340
So he made a chick
blow him for 30 grand.

360
00:18:22,408 --> 00:18:24,342
Mike Tyson makes you blow him

361
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:27,179
"'Cause I said so. That's why."

362
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,387
I'll drink to that, too.

363
00:18:35,454 --> 00:18:37,222
I'll drink...

364
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:40,091
Isn't that right,
Steve-O?

365
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,231
And so, Charlie,
I'm happy to say,

366
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:49,267
whether it's your Adonis DNA,
your tiger blood,

367
00:18:49,335 --> 00:18:51,536
or the drug
called Charlie Sheen,

368
00:18:51,604 --> 00:18:55,607
for some reason, you're able
to defy science and medicine

369
00:18:55,675 --> 00:18:57,809
and continue to survive.

370
00:18:57,877 --> 00:19:01,980
I'll pencil you in
for your relapse next week.

371
00:19:02,048 --> 00:19:04,849
Thank you so much.
Good night.

372
00:19:08,454 --> 00:19:11,122
Still to come, Jeff Ross...

373
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:14,259
I wanted to dress like
the world's biggest dictator

374
00:19:14,327 --> 00:19:15,360
to roast the world's
biggest dick.

375
00:19:15,428 --> 00:19:16,628
Steve-O...

376
00:19:16,696 --> 00:19:17,963
Just a bunch a people
having a great time

377
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,365
- being mean to each other.
- And Mike Tyson.

378
00:19:20,433 --> 00:19:23,401
Charlie, um, enjoy a night
of some serious "bambargment."

379
00:19:23,469 --> 00:19:25,570
And I'm gonna rip you
a new asshole.

380
00:19:25,638 --> 00:19:28,015
And, um, I still love you--
no hard feelings.

381
00:19:34,385 --> 00:19:35,688
All right.

382
00:19:35,756 --> 00:19:38,424
Here comes Jeff Ross...

383
00:19:42,763 --> 00:19:44,930
Who actually toured
with Charlie.

384
00:19:44,998 --> 00:19:47,066
You know, I always thought
Jeff was a terrible comic,

385
00:19:47,134 --> 00:19:49,034
until I learned
that he actually is

386
00:19:49,102 --> 00:19:52,905
seriously, for real,
mentally retarded.

387
00:19:52,973 --> 00:19:56,675
And now I think he's
an inspiration and a hero.

388
00:19:56,743 --> 00:19:59,645
So please welcome America's
special needs comedian,

389
00:19:59,713 --> 00:20:01,747
Jeff Ross.

390
00:20:10,857 --> 00:20:11,924
Yeah!

391
00:20:11,992 --> 00:20:15,060
Give it up for the warlock!

392
00:20:16,897 --> 00:20:21,167
Friends, roasters, enablers,

393
00:20:21,234 --> 00:20:24,637
lend Mike Tyson your ears.

394
00:20:29,176 --> 00:20:30,976
Because this lineup
is so pathetic,

395
00:20:31,044 --> 00:20:34,780
I was hoping I'd get replaced
by Ashton Kutcher.

396
00:20:37,984 --> 00:20:40,920
What a bunch of nobodies
we're left with.

397
00:20:40,987 --> 00:20:44,356
Is this a roast
or the republican primaries?

398
00:20:46,927 --> 00:20:50,196
This is hard.
How do you roast a meltdown?

399
00:20:51,898 --> 00:20:53,666
Charlie's meltdown was so bad,

400
00:20:53,733 --> 00:20:56,502
Al Gore's making
a documentary about it.

401
00:20:59,606 --> 00:21:01,040
Tell us, Charlie.

402
00:21:01,107 --> 00:21:05,344
How do you go from being
TV’s highest-paid actor ever

403
00:21:05,412 --> 00:21:11,817
to being the highest actor
ever to be on TV?

404
00:21:11,885 --> 00:21:13,686
Charlie's nostrils are
so snotty and full of coke

405
00:21:13,753 --> 00:21:15,688
he calls them
the Hilton sisters.

406
00:21:20,727 --> 00:21:22,094
Instead of getting his life
together,

407
00:21:22,162 --> 00:21:24,730
Charlie went out on
a national comedy tour...

408
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:27,399
Where every night, Charlie,
you walked on stage

409
00:21:27,467 --> 00:21:30,469
and you told the audience
you were a warlock from Mars.

410
00:21:30,537 --> 00:21:32,204
Oh, maybe you are.

411
00:21:32,272 --> 00:21:33,572
But I'll tell you
what you're not--

412
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,008
a comedian from earth.

413
00:21:40,647 --> 00:21:42,715
Charlie Sheen is to stand-up

414
00:21:42,782 --> 00:21:46,218
what Larry Flynt
is to standing up.

415
00:21:51,858 --> 00:21:53,158
Charlie, if you're winning,

416
00:21:53,226 --> 00:21:56,195
then something's wrong
with the [bleep] scoreboard.

417
00:21:59,266 --> 00:22:00,432
Come on, man.

418
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,800
Charlie, if you're winning,

419
00:22:01,868 --> 00:22:04,970
then this must not be
a child custody hearing.

420
00:22:07,307 --> 00:22:10,542
The only time your kids
get to see you is in reruns.

421
00:22:13,113 --> 00:22:16,982
Charlie, don't you want to live
to see their first 12 steps?

422
00:22:20,854 --> 00:22:22,588
You're the black sheep
of a family

423
00:22:22,656 --> 00:22:26,625
responsible for three
<i>Mighty Ducks</i> movies.

424
00:22:28,962 --> 00:22:30,863
You make your own
father ashamed

425
00:22:30,931 --> 00:22:33,832
that he shares the same
fake name as you.

426
00:22:36,369 --> 00:22:37,937
Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez

427
00:22:38,004 --> 00:22:39,505
said they would have
been here tonight,

428
00:22:39,572 --> 00:22:41,740
but they had
a family obligation.

429
00:22:51,184 --> 00:22:52,952
Charlie's never lonely.
Don't worry.

430
00:22:53,019 --> 00:22:54,486
I've been up to that house.

431
00:22:54,554 --> 00:22:58,023
I can tell you that Charlie
is stockpiling whores up there.

432
00:22:58,091 --> 00:22:59,658
The place is packed
with whores.

433
00:22:59,726 --> 00:23:02,828
Charlie,
you should be on <i>Hoarders.</i>

434
00:23:04,998 --> 00:23:06,799
Charlie Sheen
has paid for so much sex,

435
00:23:06,866 --> 00:23:10,502
he keeps his credit card
under his balls to save time.

436
00:23:13,673 --> 00:23:16,508
Anthony Jeselnik, some say
you're the next Greg Giraldo.

437
00:23:16,576 --> 00:23:18,444
Let's hope so.

438
00:23:23,817 --> 00:23:25,184
Where's slash?
There he is.

439
00:23:25,251 --> 00:23:27,086
Slash, you were awesome
in the open of the show, man.

440
00:23:27,153 --> 00:23:29,154
That was cool.

441
00:23:29,222 --> 00:23:31,190
Always in that top hat, man.

442
00:23:31,257 --> 00:23:34,660
You're like the Abe Lincoln
of rock and roll...

443
00:23:34,728 --> 00:23:36,195
Especially since
you haven't had a hit

444
00:23:36,262 --> 00:23:38,297
in four score and seven years.

445
00:23:38,365 --> 00:23:39,765
Yeah.

446
00:23:44,504 --> 00:23:46,005
I'm kidding, slash.

447
00:23:46,072 --> 00:23:48,374
Thanks for playing my nephew's
bar mitzvah last year.

448
00:23:48,441 --> 00:23:50,209
That was cool.

449
00:23:50,276 --> 00:23:53,412
That was really cool.

450
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,515
And oh, wow, look at that.

451
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:58,117
Looking good, Brooke Mueller.

452
00:23:58,184 --> 00:23:59,785
Charlie's ex.
What's up, babe?

453
00:23:59,853 --> 00:24:01,186
What's up?

454
00:24:01,254 --> 00:24:02,521
She's not very bright

455
00:24:02,589 --> 00:24:04,757
unless Charlie's throwing
a lamp at her.

456
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,862
Too soon?

457
00:24:12,332 --> 00:24:14,333
Oh, Jon Lovitz.

458
00:24:14,401 --> 00:24:16,468
Great job tonight, man.
That was funny.

459
00:24:16,536 --> 00:24:20,105
Nice to see you taking a break
from taking a break.

460
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:24,576
Jon, what's your catch phrase?

461
00:24:24,644 --> 00:24:27,146
"Chinning!"

462
00:24:32,452 --> 00:24:33,752
And there's our old
roast honoree,

463
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,321
William Shatner, one of
the coolest guys in the world.

464
00:24:40,527 --> 00:24:41,960
I'm not gonna make fun of him,

465
00:24:42,028 --> 00:24:44,096
'cause he looks like
he's on his final frontier.

466
00:24:46,533 --> 00:24:47,866
Hey, Captain Kirk,

467
00:24:47,934 --> 00:24:51,336
maybe Scotty can beam your balls
up from the floor...

468
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,941
You old pervert.

469
00:24:56,009 --> 00:24:58,277
Backstage he flashed Kate Walsh

470
00:24:58,344 --> 00:25:00,245
his graying anatomy.

471
00:25:04,451 --> 00:25:05,951
And I can't believe
I get to sit

472
00:25:06,019 --> 00:25:08,654
next to the--
"Iron" Mike Tyson, man,

473
00:25:08,721 --> 00:25:11,590
one of the coolest, most amazing
athletes in the world.

474
00:25:11,658 --> 00:25:13,959
Thanks for rolling with
the punches tonight, champ.

475
00:25:14,027 --> 00:25:16,028
Thank you, Jeff.
Thank you, Jeff.

476
00:25:16,096 --> 00:25:17,696
I bet you haven't been
shit on this hard

477
00:25:17,764 --> 00:25:20,799
since you cleaned
your pigeon Coop this morning.

478
00:25:23,036 --> 00:25:26,805
Not only do you love pigeons,
but you sound like one.

479
00:25:28,975 --> 00:25:30,609
Listen, I'm not gonna make fun
of Mike Tyson,

480
00:25:30,677 --> 00:25:32,211
because if he--

481
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:34,446
That's right. 'Cause I'm gonna
shit on you tonight.

482
00:25:34,514 --> 00:25:36,348
That's right.
I know, I know.

483
00:25:36,416 --> 00:25:38,283
If you're willing to do that
to your face,

484
00:25:38,351 --> 00:25:42,421
imagine what
he would do to mine.

485
00:25:42,489 --> 00:25:47,059
What is that on your face,
a target for pepper spray?

486
00:25:47,127 --> 00:25:48,827
Mike, the ironic thing is,

487
00:25:48,895 --> 00:25:50,596
after all the faces
you bashed in,

488
00:25:50,663 --> 00:25:53,632
the one you [bleep] up
the most is your own.

489
00:26:00,373 --> 00:26:03,175
Ah, but there's no denying
the fact that Mike Tyson

490
00:26:03,243 --> 00:26:06,411
had the hardest-hitting
right hook in history.

491
00:26:06,479 --> 00:26:08,981
Your opponents spent more time
bleeding in the corner

492
00:26:09,048 --> 00:26:11,250
than Charlie's ex-wives.

493
00:26:13,286 --> 00:26:17,723
Too soon? Too soon?

494
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,591
Too real? Too real?

495
00:26:23,263 --> 00:26:26,965
Has anybody seen your ex-goddess
Bree Olson's latest movie?

496
00:26:27,033 --> 00:26:29,735
Last time I saw that many guys
coming out of the same hole,

497
00:26:29,802 --> 00:26:33,272
I was watching the rescue
of the Chilean miners.

498
00:26:38,178 --> 00:26:40,279
Charlie, by taking
these punches from us tonight,

499
00:26:40,346 --> 00:26:41,914
you've proved to all your fans

500
00:26:41,981 --> 00:26:44,316
that you're the new king
of the comebacks.

501
00:26:44,384 --> 00:26:45,717
Yeah.

502
00:26:45,785 --> 00:26:48,387
In fact...

503
00:26:48,454 --> 00:26:50,155
In fact you've [bleep]
on more backs

504
00:26:50,223 --> 00:26:52,057
than anyone in Hollywood.

505
00:26:57,163 --> 00:26:59,264
Charlie,
when you were on the tour,

506
00:26:59,332 --> 00:27:01,667
I roasted you eight times
in eight different cities.

507
00:27:01,734 --> 00:27:04,469
And I got meaner every time.
You were a great sport--

508
00:27:04,537 --> 00:27:07,773
perhaps the greatest sport
in roast history,

509
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,142
and I don't know
what you're gonna do next,

510
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:11,710
but whatever you decide,

511
00:27:11,778 --> 00:27:15,013
I know firsthand that there's
an army of fans out there

512
00:27:15,081 --> 00:27:17,416
waiting to check it out
and support you

513
00:27:17,483 --> 00:27:19,918
in a big way.

514
00:27:19,986 --> 00:27:22,421
I love you guys.
Thank you so much.

515
00:27:22,488 --> 00:27:25,257
The warlock--the best.

516
00:27:29,896 --> 00:27:31,263
Coming up...

517
00:27:31,331 --> 00:27:32,998
We're not gonna be bashing
ourselves,

518
00:27:33,066 --> 00:27:35,000
but we're gonna listen
to Charlie get bashed.

519
00:27:35,068 --> 00:27:37,102
Mike Tyson,
Steve-O,

520
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,338
and William Shatner.

521
00:27:39,405 --> 00:27:40,973
We roasted William Shatner,

522
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,108
and now he's back to show
everybody he's a good sport.

523
00:27:43,176 --> 00:27:44,743
No, I'm not a good sport.

524
00:27:44,811 --> 00:27:46,511
I'm after revenge.

525
00:27:53,265 --> 00:27:56,840
All right, our next roaster
is Mike Tyson.

526
00:27:58,211 --> 00:27:59,912
Tyson has had three marriages.

527
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:02,107
The first two
ended in knockouts.

528
00:28:04,817 --> 00:28:05,951
He's a guy--

529
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:08,086
I threw in the [bleep] towel.

530
00:28:08,154 --> 00:28:10,055
Please don't murder me.
He's a guy...

531
00:28:12,592 --> 00:28:16,122
He's a guy who's beaten every
opponent he has gone up against

532
00:28:16,242 --> 00:28:18,497
except the letter "S."

533
00:28:18,565 --> 00:28:19,865
So...

534
00:28:22,569 --> 00:28:25,771
So now please...

535
00:28:25,838 --> 00:28:28,507
Please be patient
as he sounds out his jokes.

536
00:28:28,575 --> 00:28:33,579
Ladies and gentlemen,
"Iron" Mike Tyson!

537
00:28:35,348 --> 00:28:37,616
♪ Mama said knock you out ♪

538
00:28:37,684 --> 00:28:39,651
♪ I'm gonna knock you out ♪

539
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:41,853
Oh, shit.

540
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:44,456
Thank you.
Thank you very much, Seth.

541
00:28:44,524 --> 00:28:47,793
Oh, man.

542
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:51,630
Well, you know, during
a very dark period in my life,

543
00:28:51,698 --> 00:28:53,632
I found inspiration

544
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,735
by reading the great
epic poet the <i>Iliad.</i>

545
00:28:56,803 --> 00:28:58,170
So, see, Seth,

546
00:28:58,237 --> 00:28:59,404
you're not the only person

547
00:28:59,472 --> 00:29:03,008
that gotten by
by taking ideas from homer.

548
00:29:05,178 --> 00:29:06,378
That's a [bleep] idiot
over there.

549
00:29:06,446 --> 00:29:08,313
He's a [bleep] idiot,
with that Stewie.

550
00:29:08,381 --> 00:29:11,850
Okay.
All right.

551
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:14,486
Well, if I must confess,
I'm really not a roaster.

552
00:29:14,554 --> 00:29:15,821
Of course, you know, everyone,

553
00:29:15,888 --> 00:29:17,422
I don't like hurting people.

554
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:20,759
And, um, I'm living, you know,

555
00:29:20,827 --> 00:29:23,962
more of a spiritual life now
through poetry,

556
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:26,465
and I've written...

557
00:29:32,538 --> 00:29:35,440
Well, you know,
I've written, you know,

558
00:29:35,508 --> 00:29:37,442
many verses
in my secret garden,

559
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:41,480
and now I'd like to share them
with a few of you here today.

560
00:29:41,547 --> 00:29:43,448
Thank you, everybody.

561
00:29:43,516 --> 00:29:45,417
Well, this'll be a honor,

562
00:29:45,485 --> 00:29:47,586
because, um, as the bard
once said,

563
00:29:47,654 --> 00:29:49,821
"All the world's a stage."

564
00:29:49,889 --> 00:29:53,592
And Charlie's been booed off
them all, of course.

565
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:56,061
In this first verse,

566
00:29:56,129 --> 00:30:03,001
you'll recognize the classic
a-a-b-b-a poetic structure.

567
00:30:03,069 --> 00:30:05,804
There once was a old man
named Ross

568
00:30:05,872 --> 00:30:09,207
whose jokes
were covered with moss.

569
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:13,245
His punch line was musty,
his premise was dusty,

570
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:17,816
I wish he'd suck on a [bleep]
exhaust, you know?

571
00:30:17,884 --> 00:30:19,551
Oh.
So excuse me.

572
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:21,987
What you gonna do, Jeff?

573
00:30:22,055 --> 00:30:24,489
What the [bleep]
you gonna do, Jeff?

574
00:30:24,557 --> 00:30:27,659
You know, I'm--
you know, I must say, you know,

575
00:30:27,727 --> 00:30:29,761
I'm rather intrigued
by your puffy, grotesque

576
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:31,997
[bleep] face, Jeff, you know?

577
00:30:32,065 --> 00:30:34,266
Normally--normally
when I'm next to somebody

578
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,034
whose face
is grotesque as yours,

579
00:30:36,102 --> 00:30:37,836
they throw in
the [bleep] towel, man.

580
00:30:37,904 --> 00:30:41,273
You're a mess, man.

581
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,809
During your performance,
I wish I bit my own ears off.

582
00:30:43,876 --> 00:30:45,343
You know?
You [bleep] suck, man.

583
00:30:45,411 --> 00:30:47,579
You suck!

584
00:30:47,647 --> 00:30:52,217
Yes, I wish I bit my own shit.

585
00:30:52,285 --> 00:30:54,219
All right. All right.

586
00:30:54,287 --> 00:30:56,855
- That was the best.
- All right.

587
00:30:56,923 --> 00:30:59,124
Now--
no, come on, stop.

588
00:30:59,192 --> 00:31:01,393
I got to do this shit right.
All right.

589
00:31:01,461 --> 00:31:03,495
I didn't do well in school,

590
00:31:03,563 --> 00:31:05,030
but I'm trying to do this shit.

591
00:31:05,098 --> 00:31:06,698
All right.

592
00:31:06,766 --> 00:31:08,734
Charlie, our next poem

593
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:11,169
was inspired
by the great Emily Dickinson,

594
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:13,271
who I consider a real goddess.

595
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:15,741
You know, whatever happened
to them hos, man?

596
00:31:15,808 --> 00:31:17,109
Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry.

597
00:31:17,176 --> 00:31:19,845
But, Charlie,
let me remind you...

598
00:31:19,912 --> 00:31:21,680
Something every man must know.

599
00:31:21,748 --> 00:31:23,248
Once the money goes,

600
00:31:23,316 --> 00:31:24,716
so does the hos.

601
00:31:24,784 --> 00:31:28,453
Trust me on that one, Charlie.

602
00:31:28,521 --> 00:31:30,021
Man, come on,
let's keep it real.

603
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:31,523
You know, Brooke,

604
00:31:31,591 --> 00:31:33,658
Charlie had every [bleep]
disease known to man,

605
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:35,460
but still,
you [bleep] his [bleep]

606
00:31:35,528 --> 00:31:38,997
before you shake
Steve-O's hand, you know?

607
00:31:44,303 --> 00:31:46,671
This wife-beating cokehead

608
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:48,774
claims he's some
rock star from Mars.

609
00:31:48,841 --> 00:31:51,943
Man, if he was black, his ass
would be behind bars, you know?

610
00:31:52,011 --> 00:31:53,578
Which is [bleep] bullshit,

611
00:31:53,646 --> 00:31:55,113
because I'm
the greatest poet alive!

612
00:31:55,181 --> 00:31:56,915
I'm the greatest
wordsmith ever.

613
00:31:56,983 --> 00:31:58,517
I'm the--I'm Robert Frost.

614
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:00,051
I'm--I'm Lord Byron.

615
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:03,221
My verses are impetuous,
my rhymes impregnable.

616
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:04,723
I want to eat your children!

617
00:32:04,791 --> 00:32:06,658
I--I...

618
00:32:11,564 --> 00:32:14,699
But, of course,
I'm using poetic license,

619
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:17,035
and, um, they haven't
revoked that one yet.

620
00:32:17,103 --> 00:32:20,172
And thank you all, guys.

621
00:32:20,239 --> 00:32:23,575
May you guys continue
and resume to being nasty

622
00:32:23,643 --> 00:32:25,744
and talking mean
to one another.

623
00:32:25,812 --> 00:32:27,913
God bless you.
Bye, guys.

624
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,548
I'm finished.

625
00:32:33,486 --> 00:32:35,187
Thank you.

626
00:32:35,254 --> 00:32:38,256
Still to come,
Anthony Jeselnik...

627
00:32:38,324 --> 00:32:40,258
Charlie Sheen keeps saying
he's winning.

628
00:32:40,326 --> 00:32:42,727
That guy couldn't win
a goddamn coin toss.

629
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:44,763
- William Shatner...
- Will you sit down?

630
00:32:44,831 --> 00:32:45,997
And Charlie Sheen.

631
00:32:46,065 --> 00:32:46,998
You can't help
but feel for him,

632
00:32:47,066 --> 00:32:48,600
'cause he is your friend,

633
00:32:48,668 --> 00:32:50,535
plus, uh, you know,
he owes me a hooker,

634
00:32:50,603 --> 00:32:53,459
so I'm looking for--
does anybody know where he is?

635
00:32:59,239 --> 00:33:03,166
Our next roaster
is Anthony Jeselnik.

636
00:33:06,409 --> 00:33:07,811
Anthony Jeselnik's act

637
00:33:07,931 --> 00:33:09,745
combines the excitement
of standing there

638
00:33:09,813 --> 00:33:11,887
with the thrill
of saying words.

639
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:17,319
You know him best from me
saying his name right now.

640
00:33:17,387 --> 00:33:20,589
Please welcome a man
who's got a bright future

641
00:33:20,657 --> 00:33:22,224
in something other than comedy,

642
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:24,226
Anthony Jeselnik.

643
00:33:34,871 --> 00:33:36,272
Thank you.

644
00:33:36,339 --> 00:33:39,141
Seth MacFarlane,
everybody, huh?

645
00:33:41,344 --> 00:33:43,979
This is MacFarlane's third time
hosting the show,

646
00:33:44,047 --> 00:33:46,215
which should come
as no surprise,

647
00:33:46,283 --> 00:33:48,784
because when Seth MacFarlane
does something,

648
00:33:48,852 --> 00:33:53,422
by God, he repeats
the living shit out of it.

649
00:33:57,961 --> 00:34:00,396
My good friend
Jeff Ross is here...

650
00:34:03,133 --> 00:34:05,968
Even though it's laundry day.

651
00:34:09,406 --> 00:34:11,106
And Kate Walsh...

652
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:15,311
I don't watch
that stupid show you're on.

653
00:34:15,378 --> 00:34:17,713
But I did think
it was interesting

654
00:34:17,781 --> 00:34:20,883
that you have your own line
of perfume, you know,

655
00:34:20,951 --> 00:34:22,818
for that special lady

656
00:34:22,886 --> 00:34:26,388
who wants to smell like
"Who gives a [bleep]?"

657
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:33,462
I'm glad William Shatner

658
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:36,498
could squeeze this roast
into his schedule...

659
00:34:39,135 --> 00:34:42,605
In between cosmetic surgeries.

660
00:34:42,672 --> 00:34:45,107
Bill, your face is so plastic

661
00:34:45,175 --> 00:34:46,642
that when you're done with it,

662
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,644
they're gonna have to cut it up
into little pieces

663
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:51,247
so that birds don't die.

664
00:34:57,787 --> 00:35:00,756
What's up, Steve-O?

665
00:35:00,824 --> 00:35:02,791
Steve-O, I know you were
in a dark place for a while.

666
00:35:02,859 --> 00:35:04,026
You were struggling.

667
00:35:04,094 --> 00:35:06,695
But now you're trying
stand-up comedy.

668
00:35:06,763 --> 00:35:09,431
I actually saw you perform
once at the comedy cellar,

669
00:35:09,499 --> 00:35:11,634
and here's some free advice,
Steve-O.

670
00:35:11,701 --> 00:35:14,603
Don't give up your suicide.

671
00:35:18,441 --> 00:35:20,476
Patrice O'Neal is here.

672
00:35:20,543 --> 00:35:24,146
You literally cannot miss him.

673
00:35:24,214 --> 00:35:25,447
Holy Christ, you're fat.

674
00:35:25,515 --> 00:35:27,816
You look like
you deep-fry your hands

675
00:35:27,884 --> 00:35:30,986
before you bite
your fingernails.

676
00:35:31,054 --> 00:35:33,622
That's a good joke.

677
00:35:36,459 --> 00:35:38,761
That's a racist joke!

678
00:35:38,828 --> 00:35:40,296
That's some racist shit
right there.

679
00:35:40,363 --> 00:35:43,866
Mike Tyson.

680
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:46,468
That's the whole joke.

681
00:35:48,672 --> 00:35:49,805
Mike Tyson, I love you.

682
00:35:49,873 --> 00:35:52,942
You're my favorite boxer
of all time.

683
00:35:53,009 --> 00:35:55,277
I don't even want to stand up
here and make fun of you.

684
00:35:55,345 --> 00:35:58,614
Besides, what can you say
about Mike Tyson

685
00:35:58,682 --> 00:36:03,285
that hasn't already been the
title of a Richard Pryor album.

686
00:36:03,353 --> 00:36:05,721
Oh, shit.

687
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:06,622
- He got it.
- I did.

688
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:07,890
Patrice got it.

689
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:09,224
Too many white people
to get that.

690
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,260
Too many white people?

691
00:36:11,328 --> 00:36:14,496
You know what no one ever says
is "too few black people."

692
00:36:23,006 --> 00:36:26,642
Yeah.

693
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:30,379
Mike, to me, you will always
be the champion.

694
00:36:30,447 --> 00:36:32,514
You will always
be the champion...

695
00:36:32,582 --> 00:36:34,416
Thank you very much.

696
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:38,387
The champion of having more
shit on your face than seal.

697
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:49,999
Mike Tyson
got a tattoo on his face

698
00:36:50,066 --> 00:36:53,135
so that every time
he looks in the mirror,

699
00:36:53,203 --> 00:36:56,105
he can be proud
that converting to Islam

700
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:59,942
is only the second dumbest
thing he's ever done.

701
00:37:01,478 --> 00:37:04,279
That's good.

702
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:07,883
You regret it.

703
00:37:07,951 --> 00:37:09,885
I well may.

704
00:37:09,953 --> 00:37:11,620
And now
for the man of the hour,

705
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,856
Mr. Charlie Sheen.

706
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,961
Charlie, I don't understand

707
00:37:19,029 --> 00:37:21,897
why you're not grateful
for what you have right now.

708
00:37:21,965 --> 00:37:23,365
I mean, after all,

709
00:37:23,433 --> 00:37:26,468
the only reason you got on TV
in the first place

710
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:29,304
is because God hates
Michael j. Fox.

711
00:37:41,351 --> 00:37:45,754
Charlie, you are a monster.

712
00:37:45,822 --> 00:37:48,524
Every moment of your life

713
00:37:48,591 --> 00:37:52,594
looks like the first two minutes
of <i>Law & Order: SVU.</i>

714
00:37:58,835 --> 00:38:01,870
You've convinced more women
to have abortions

715
00:38:01,938 --> 00:38:06,708
than the prenatal test
for [bleep] syndrome.

716
00:38:11,114 --> 00:38:13,715
And, Charlie, I think
the craziest thing about you

717
00:38:13,783 --> 00:38:17,820
is that you thought you were
gonna go back to your TV show

718
00:38:17,887 --> 00:38:22,958
after calling your boss
a "Jew [bleep]."

719
00:38:23,026 --> 00:38:24,993
If people got
to keep their jobs

720
00:38:25,061 --> 00:38:28,397
after calling their boss
a Jew [bleep], Charlie,

721
00:38:28,465 --> 00:38:31,133
then everyone would do it.

722
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:42,277
But, Charlie,

723
00:38:42,345 --> 00:38:46,381
despite everything
I've just said,

724
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,617
you're a good sport
for being here tonight.

725
00:38:48,685 --> 00:38:50,319
Thanks for letting me
be here, too.

726
00:38:50,386 --> 00:38:51,320
Thank you, everybody.

727
00:38:51,387 --> 00:38:52,721
Thanks a lot.

728
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,695
The <i>Comedy Central Roast</i>
<i>of Charlie Sheen</i>

729
00:38:59,762 --> 00:39:03,532
is brought to you
by <i>FIFA Soccer 12.</i>

730
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,767
Still to come, Steve-O...

731
00:39:05,835 --> 00:39:08,170
This is critical
if I'm gonna have a future

732
00:39:08,238 --> 00:39:10,806
beyond breaking bones
and shoving things up my butt.

733
00:39:10,874 --> 00:39:12,207
Amy Schumer...

734
00:39:12,275 --> 00:39:13,675
I'm gonna get
shit-faced.

735
00:39:13,743 --> 00:39:16,044
I'm gonna be slurring
and throwing up on strangers.

736
00:39:16,112 --> 00:39:17,513
And Patrice O'Neal.

737
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,615
This should be
my last show ever.

738
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:30,664
Uh, our next roaster
is Steve-O.

739
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,103
This guy makes it easy for us

740
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:35,772
to bust his balls
and pull his leg,

741
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:39,609
because his balls are usually
stapled to his leg.

742
00:39:39,676 --> 00:39:44,046
So, now, please give up
your horse semen for Steve-O.

743
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:55,124
What an honor to be here
with Mike Tyson.

744
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:57,693
The last time
I hung out with Mike,

745
00:39:57,761 --> 00:39:59,629
we locked ourselves
in a bathroom

746
00:39:59,696 --> 00:40:05,501
and ripped through
five grams of cocaine.

747
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:08,104
But Mike's really
changed his ways, though.

748
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:11,274
See, here he is taking
a beating for a check,

749
00:40:11,341 --> 00:40:14,811
and it hasn't been made out
to Don King.

750
00:40:14,878 --> 00:40:19,382
That is a good one.
That is a good one.

751
00:40:19,449 --> 00:40:23,820
Some people know Kate Walsh
as a television actress,

752
00:40:23,887 --> 00:40:26,789
but most people
don't know her at all.

753
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,395
And my hero...

754
00:40:32,462 --> 00:40:34,831
Charlie Sheen.

755
00:40:36,733 --> 00:40:39,135
Charlie definitely has
tiger blood

756
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:41,470
coursing through his veins.

757
00:40:41,538 --> 00:40:47,243
Unfortunately, that tiger is
a helpless drug addict.

758
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:51,647
Dude, your nose is like my ass.

759
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:53,850
There's nothing
you won't shove up there.

760
00:40:57,521 --> 00:41:01,123
I've been clean and sober
for 3 1/2 years now...

761
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:08,898
But Charlie still
hasn't hit rock bottom.

762
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,766
I know he's looking forward
to it, though,

763
00:41:10,834 --> 00:41:14,203
because he thinks
there's a rock there.

764
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:18,574
You know, when Charlie started

765
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:21,043
referring to his girlfriends
as goddesses,

766
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:22,812
I was confused,

767
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,347
so I looked it up
in the dictionary.

768
00:41:24,414 --> 00:41:28,885
It said,
"Goddesses, plural, noun--

769
00:41:28,952 --> 00:41:32,255
two [bleep] dumpsters who got
sick of buying their own drugs."

770
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:41,797
But, Charlie,
don't ever pretend

771
00:41:41,865 --> 00:41:45,067
that you're not a totally
bitchin' rock star from Mars,

772
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:46,903
because you are.

773
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:49,305
And I love you.

774
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:51,607
And I am so grateful

775
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,509
that you've let me be
a part of this tonight.

776
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:57,613
Right now I'm gonna do something
insanely stupid for you.

777
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,849
I am going to attempt

778
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:01,751
to get a black eye

779
00:42:01,818 --> 00:42:05,388
from the former heavyweight
champion of the world.

780
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:13,796
Mike, bro, I am ready.

781
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:16,599
Let me get that fist.

782
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:21,737
Man, I don't want
to do this shit, man.

783
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:26,309
We're not gonna call the police
or anything after this.

784
00:42:26,376 --> 00:42:27,510
[Bleep] him up, Mike!

785
00:42:27,577 --> 00:42:29,378
All right.

786
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:32,315
Okay.

787
00:42:32,382 --> 00:42:34,717
One, two, three.

788
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:35,685
Go for it.

789
00:42:35,752 --> 00:42:39,188
Aah!

790
00:42:39,256 --> 00:42:40,156
Ah.

791
00:42:40,223 --> 00:42:41,657
I think that'll do it.

792
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:44,327
Thank you, everybody.

793
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,998
Wow.

794
00:42:53,036 --> 00:42:55,938
That's what it looks like when
an asshole gets fisted, I guess.

795
00:42:56,006 --> 00:42:57,840
All right.

796
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:03,579
All right, what can I say
about Amy Schumer?

797
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:05,748
Um, I actually
mean that sincerely.

798
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:08,517
I've never heard of this woman.

799
00:43:08,585 --> 00:43:11,654
So please get ready
for the comedy stylings

800
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:13,255
of the fourth runner-up

801
00:43:13,323 --> 00:43:15,658
of the fifth season
of <i>Last Comic Standing,</i>

802
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:17,827
Amy Schumer.

803
00:43:30,073 --> 00:43:32,708
Mike "Tython."

804
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,477
Am I saying that right?

805
00:43:34,544 --> 00:43:37,413
Ha ha.
I'll get you good.

806
00:43:39,616 --> 00:43:41,917
Wasn't he great up here?

807
00:43:41,985 --> 00:43:43,386
No, I'm asking.

808
00:43:43,453 --> 00:43:47,289
I couldn't understand
a [bleep] word he said.

809
00:43:47,357 --> 00:43:50,359
Mike, your voice sounds
like a girl crying.

810
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:51,594
Every time you speak,

811
00:43:51,661 --> 00:43:54,096
do you give yourself
an erection?

812
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:56,966
Sometimes.
Depends what I'm talking about--

813
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:58,267
Hey, hey, hey, Mike,

814
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,568
here's something
you'll never hear--

815
00:43:59,636 --> 00:44:01,804
"Great tattoo!"

816
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:08,611
You have a slutty
lower-back tattoo on your face.

817
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:15,918
Men don't know
whether to be scared of it

818
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,820
or finish on it.

819
00:44:21,391 --> 00:44:22,825
Look at that face.

820
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:25,261
It's so--
it's so dark and wrinkly

821
00:44:25,328 --> 00:44:26,796
and constantly getting pounded.

822
00:44:26,863 --> 00:44:28,731
It's like Patrice's
grandmother's asshole

823
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:31,200
after a gospel brunch.

824
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:33,135
Oh. Shit.

825
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:36,205
I'm just assuming
she raised you.

826
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,581
Patrice O'Neal,
one of my favorite comics--

827
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:50,219
Patrice has always been destined
for stardom and diabetes.

828
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:53,122
So tonight is not just
the roast of Charlie Sheen.

829
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:56,792
It's also a farewell party
for Patrice's foot.

830
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,195
Diabetes--holy shit.

831
00:44:59,262 --> 00:45:01,997
Evil. Sitting next to this bitch
the whole time.

832
00:45:02,065 --> 00:45:03,632
I didn't know she--
this was coming.

833
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,201
It's true.

834
00:45:05,268 --> 00:45:08,137
If Amy had as many dicks
coming out as she had going in,

835
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:10,806
she'd look like
a [bleep] porcupine.

836
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,175
Is his interpreter here?

837
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:21,917
Anthony,
what's your last name--

838
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:23,619
Uh, Van Der Sloot?

839
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:25,588
What is it?
Uh...

840
00:45:25,655 --> 00:45:27,790
You have all the likeability
of a Hitler youth.

841
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:29,325
Look at you.

842
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:35,798
Speaking of Kate Walsh,
Kate, to some people,

843
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:37,600
<i>Grey's Anatomy</i>
is more than a TV show.

844
00:45:37,667 --> 00:45:39,335
In fact, <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>

845
00:45:39,402 --> 00:45:41,504
is what William Shatner
calls his balls.

846
00:45:41,571 --> 00:45:43,639
Right?

847
00:45:43,707 --> 00:45:45,341
William.

848
00:45:45,408 --> 00:45:48,410
I've seen less bloated men
dredged out of rivers.

849
00:45:48,478 --> 00:45:51,413
What's going on?

850
00:45:51,481 --> 00:45:53,849
Wha--does Priceline pay you
in empanadas?

851
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,484
What's happening?

852
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:58,420
- Are you taking that from her?
- Oh, yeah, we have to.

853
00:45:58,488 --> 00:46:01,257
- You got to get her back!
- Go get her.

854
00:46:01,324 --> 00:46:02,391
And Steve-O is here.

855
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:04,960
Steve-O, great try.

856
00:46:05,028 --> 00:46:07,129
Steve-O...

857
00:46:07,197 --> 00:46:09,298
But I truly am, no joke,

858
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:11,534
sorry for the loss
of your friend Ryan Dunn.

859
00:46:11,601 --> 00:46:12,635
I know
you must have been thinking,

860
00:46:12,702 --> 00:46:13,969
"It could have been me,"

861
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:15,604
and I know we were all thinking,
"Why wasn't it?"

862
00:46:15,672 --> 00:46:18,207
Um...

863
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:22,278
Thank you.

864
00:46:22,345 --> 00:46:23,846
[Bleep] you, Amy!

865
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:27,116
Oh, Mike.
Stay away from me.

866
00:46:27,184 --> 00:46:28,918
Speaking of things
that should already be dead,

867
00:46:28,985 --> 00:46:30,553
Charlie Sheen is still alive.

868
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:33,155
Charlie, you--I'm a fan.

869
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:34,990
You were amazing in <i>Platoon.</i>

870
00:46:35,058 --> 00:46:36,725
Your marriage
to Denise Richards,

871
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:38,327
it was kind of like
her Vietnam,

872
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:41,063
'cause she was constantly afraid
of being killed by Charlie.

873
00:46:48,171 --> 00:46:50,706
But there's no denying
how famous you are.

874
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:52,441
I mean,
it was international news

875
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:53,709
when you ruined the lives

876
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:55,311
of those two girls living
with you--

877
00:46:55,378 --> 00:46:56,946
you know, your daughters.

878
00:47:00,917 --> 00:47:02,017
But, no, I mean, Charlie,
you get a bad rap,

879
00:47:02,085 --> 00:47:03,886
but you're just like
Bruce Willis.

880
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:05,521
You know, you were big
in the '80s,

881
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:09,959
and now your old slot's being
filled with Ashton Kutcher.

882
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:18,801
But all joking aside,

883
00:47:18,868 --> 00:47:20,669
if you ever need a friend
to pee in a cup for you,

884
00:47:20,737 --> 00:47:21,804
I'm your gal.

885
00:47:21,871 --> 00:47:23,505
Thanks for having me.

886
00:47:28,578 --> 00:47:29,645
You know what's funny?

887
00:47:29,713 --> 00:47:30,846
I have never met
William Shatner.

888
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:32,781
Coming up, William Shatner...

889
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:34,516
And I'm very much looking
forward to meeting Shatner.

890
00:47:34,584 --> 00:47:35,651
Patrice O'Neal...

891
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:37,453
That shit is crazy, man.

892
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,887
And Charlie Sheen.

893
00:47:38,955 --> 00:47:41,390
I think if--
Wow. Look at those statues.

894
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:43,515
Sorry.
What was the question?

895
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:49,960
All right, our next roaster

896
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,633
is the legendary
William Shatner.

897
00:47:55,882 --> 00:47:57,792
Here he is.

898
00:47:57,912 --> 00:47:59,399
I can't joke about this guy,

899
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:00,686
'cause I think he's
the [bleep] greatest.

900
00:48:00,754 --> 00:48:02,521
The guy who played Captain Kirk

901
00:48:02,589 --> 00:48:05,257
back before <i>Star Trek</i> looked
like a bunch of gay guys

902
00:48:05,325 --> 00:48:08,394
working in a Mac store,
William Shatner.

903
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:14,900
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

904
00:48:14,968 --> 00:48:18,404
Keep it going for Chaz Bono.

905
00:48:18,472 --> 00:48:22,074
Uh, Charlie...

906
00:48:22,142 --> 00:48:23,409
I was driving by tonight,

907
00:48:23,477 --> 00:48:25,010
and I heard that
they were doing your roast,

908
00:48:25,078 --> 00:48:27,146
and I thought what a great--
great opportunity

909
00:48:27,214 --> 00:48:30,516
to offer this young Mexican...

910
00:48:30,584 --> 00:48:32,885
A bit of fatherly advice

911
00:48:32,953 --> 00:48:36,021
he so clearly
hasn't been getting.

912
00:48:36,089 --> 00:48:38,991
You see, I've been doing this
for quite a while now,

913
00:48:39,059 --> 00:48:42,862
and I think that, uh,
I can bestow on you

914
00:48:42,929 --> 00:48:46,832
some of the vast wisdom
from my experience

915
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,902
in this wonderful business
of entertainment.

916
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:51,270
Uh, first off, Charlie,

917
00:48:51,338 --> 00:48:52,872
I'm, uh...
I'm 80 years old.

918
00:48:52,939 --> 00:48:54,373
You're, what, 47?

919
00:48:54,441 --> 00:48:56,208
46.

920
00:48:56,276 --> 00:48:57,877
How come we look like
we went to high school together?

921
00:48:57,944 --> 00:49:00,246
And, uh...

922
00:49:00,313 --> 00:49:02,448
And you're going too fast, son.

923
00:49:02,516 --> 00:49:05,985
You got to slow down
and smell the roses, my boy.

924
00:49:09,356 --> 00:49:11,757
That's why I have
such a storied and...

925
00:49:11,825 --> 00:49:15,728
Illustrious career...

926
00:49:15,795 --> 00:49:19,331
Because I'm patient.

927
00:49:19,399 --> 00:49:21,300
I was willing
to wait a long time

928
00:49:21,368 --> 00:49:24,637
to get
into the right projects...

929
00:49:24,704 --> 00:49:27,373
Just like
Patrice O'Neal's family.

930
00:49:31,878 --> 00:49:33,112
Okay, Charlie.

931
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:36,849
So you're out of a job.
Don't feel sad.

932
00:49:36,917 --> 00:49:40,019
I know another famous guy
who was kind to whores

933
00:49:40,086 --> 00:49:42,054
and always kept
12 losers around,

934
00:49:42,122 --> 00:49:45,457
and he got crucified
by Jews, too.

935
00:49:48,528 --> 00:49:50,496
And people worshipped that guy.

936
00:49:53,066 --> 00:49:58,470
Look, look, Carlos...

937
00:49:58,538 --> 00:50:03,576
I've had my share of wild times
with the señoritas.

938
00:50:03,643 --> 00:50:05,377
Yeah.

939
00:50:08,081 --> 00:50:12,051
I've had sex in space
with green women.

940
00:50:12,118 --> 00:50:14,320
Sure, you've had sex
with blue women,

941
00:50:14,387 --> 00:50:18,891
because unlike you, they
couldn't handle their drugs.

942
00:50:18,959 --> 00:50:22,728
You don't need
that kind of press, Charlie!

943
00:50:22,796 --> 00:50:25,464
In my day, if I wanted
that kind of publicity,

944
00:50:25,532 --> 00:50:27,099
I had to do something drastic,

945
00:50:27,167 --> 00:50:30,302
like kiss a black girl......

946
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:32,504
Or let an Asian drive.

947
00:50:32,572 --> 00:50:34,340
Oh.

948
00:50:34,407 --> 00:50:37,910
May I suggest
to you, Charlie...

949
00:50:39,879 --> 00:50:43,582
That you reexamine
your relations with women?

950
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:45,985
Prostitutes cost a lot
of money, Charlie.

951
00:50:46,052 --> 00:50:47,386
Hasn't anyone told you

952
00:50:47,454 --> 00:50:50,122
that actresses
will sleep with you for free?

953
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:53,359
Man, that's--
that's Hollywood 101.

954
00:50:53,426 --> 00:50:56,762
You should have called.

955
00:50:56,830 --> 00:50:59,131
You know, uh, what will help you
get through this--

956
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:01,800
this--this tough spot,

957
00:51:01,868 --> 00:51:04,236
something--you have
to give something back.

958
00:51:04,304 --> 00:51:07,272
See, I was at--recently
at a celebrity auction

959
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:09,475
where I sold
one of my kidney stones

960
00:51:09,542 --> 00:51:11,243
for $75,000.

961
00:51:11,311 --> 00:51:12,778
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

962
00:51:12,846 --> 00:51:15,748
Do you understand
what I've done?

963
00:51:15,815 --> 00:51:21,053
I synthesized uric acid
and calcium

964
00:51:21,121 --> 00:51:23,355
inside my bladder

965
00:51:23,423 --> 00:51:27,359
and turned it into a house
for habitat for humanity.

966
00:51:27,427 --> 00:51:31,196
Who's the warlock now, bitch?

967
00:51:35,735 --> 00:51:39,738
Actually, Emilio...

968
00:51:39,806 --> 00:51:42,908
We're not that different.

969
00:51:42,976 --> 00:51:45,210
You're a rock star from Mars.

970
00:51:45,278 --> 00:51:46,812
Yes, you are.

971
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,982
And as one rocket man
to another,

972
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:51,884
if I may give you

973
00:51:51,951 --> 00:51:55,521
my most important piece
of advice tonight--

974
00:51:55,588 --> 00:52:01,026
never, ever forget to book
your next rehab stay

975
00:52:01,094 --> 00:52:03,462
through priceline.com.

976
00:52:08,268 --> 00:52:11,503
Now, Charlie, see,
you take it from the master.

977
00:52:11,571 --> 00:52:13,672
That little subtle plug there--

978
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:16,341
$65 right in the pocket.

979
00:52:16,409 --> 00:52:19,111
Whoa, my, look at the time.

980
00:52:19,179 --> 00:52:20,279
Oh, jeez.

981
00:52:20,346 --> 00:52:21,580
I got to simply--
I must get home.

982
00:52:21,648 --> 00:52:24,717
I want to catch
that new Ashton Kutcher show.

983
00:52:24,784 --> 00:52:26,952
Do you--do you know him?

984
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:29,021
- He's a nice guy.
- No.

985
00:52:29,089 --> 00:52:31,256
I went to high school
with his wife.

986
00:52:31,324 --> 00:52:33,459
Thank you very much.

987
00:52:37,864 --> 00:52:39,832
It was funny.

988
00:52:43,303 --> 00:52:45,270
He was so [bleep] Shatner-y.

989
00:52:45,338 --> 00:52:46,939
How awesome was that?

990
00:52:47,006 --> 00:52:48,373
Um...

991
00:52:48,441 --> 00:52:51,710
Our next roaster
is Patrice O'Neal.

992
00:52:53,847 --> 00:52:55,481
You may recognize Patrice

993
00:52:55,548 --> 00:52:57,382
from his many speaking roles
in movies,

994
00:52:57,450 --> 00:52:59,818
but only if you've sat
in front of him in a theater.

995
00:52:59,886 --> 00:53:02,721
Um...
I know.

996
00:53:02,789 --> 00:53:05,224
I know. Some of these jokes
may come off racist,

997
00:53:05,291 --> 00:53:07,126
which is why
it's important to remember

998
00:53:07,193 --> 00:53:08,827
that Rosa Parks fought

999
00:53:08,895 --> 00:53:11,230
so Patrice could take
three seats on the bus.

1000
00:53:15,368 --> 00:53:17,836
So please welcome a guy
who looks like Chris Farley

1001
00:53:17,904 --> 00:53:19,671
after a mine-shaft explosion,

1002
00:53:19,739 --> 00:53:22,541
the very funny Patrice O'Neal.

1003
00:53:32,318 --> 00:53:34,987
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1004
00:53:35,054 --> 00:53:36,455
I, uh...

1005
00:53:36,523 --> 00:53:38,357
It's just strange, 'cause...

1006
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:41,860
I had all this planned shit,
but I didn't...

1007
00:53:41,928 --> 00:53:43,862
Like, I didn't know
William Shatner

1008
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:45,364
was gonna be quasi...

1009
00:53:45,431 --> 00:53:47,099
Like, a old racist man.

1010
00:53:47,167 --> 00:53:48,200
Like, but...

1011
00:53:49,769 --> 00:53:53,572
But everybody's giggling,
like, "Whoa, he's..."

1012
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:57,209
You're a [bleep] asshole,
Captain Kirk.

1013
00:53:57,277 --> 00:53:59,077
What are you talking about?

1014
00:53:59,145 --> 00:54:00,746
Like, I don't respect him,

1015
00:54:00,814 --> 00:54:02,181
but, like, I'll respect him,

1016
00:54:02,248 --> 00:54:03,982
'cause he's [bleep]
Captain Kirk,

1017
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:05,484
but I think he might be racist,

1018
00:54:05,552 --> 00:54:08,620
'cause his hair plugs look like
black girls' [bleep] hair.

1019
00:54:13,426 --> 00:54:15,761
This is [bleep] amazing.

1020
00:54:15,829 --> 00:54:18,063
Like, I wasn't gonna be mean
to Anthony.

1021
00:54:18,131 --> 00:54:19,498
I don't know him.
I never met him.

1022
00:54:19,566 --> 00:54:21,967
Like, so I'm sitting
here watching him,

1023
00:54:22,035 --> 00:54:25,070
and I'm like, "He has
way too much confidence."

1024
00:54:25,138 --> 00:54:28,140
Like, in my world,
he's an open-miker.

1025
00:54:28,208 --> 00:54:30,209
Nobody knows him,
and nobody should.

1026
00:54:30,276 --> 00:54:33,478
Nobody should [bleep] know
Anthony, uh...

1027
00:54:33,546 --> 00:54:38,050
I refuse to learn
his last shitty name.

1028
00:54:38,117 --> 00:54:40,152
I learned Galifianakis.

1029
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:42,888
That's the last
shitty last name

1030
00:54:42,956 --> 00:54:46,592
this [bleep] gonna learn
in this [bleep] funky town.

1031
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:52,931
He reminds me of
a medieval restaurant waiter.

1032
00:54:52,999 --> 00:54:55,033
Like...

1033
00:54:55,101 --> 00:54:56,568
His whole demeanor.

1034
00:54:56,636 --> 00:54:59,504
Like,
"Hello, may I welcome to--"

1035
00:54:59,572 --> 00:55:00,505
and you just want to go,

1036
00:55:00,573 --> 00:55:02,307
"Shut the [bleep] up

1037
00:55:02,375 --> 00:55:04,243
"and bring me
my giant turkey leg,

1038
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:06,445
you [bleep] nothing."

1039
00:55:10,683 --> 00:55:14,553
How the [bleep] can I be
too mean after all this shit?

1040
00:55:14,621 --> 00:55:15,520
I can't believe it.

1041
00:55:15,588 --> 00:55:17,289
I'm dying of diabetes,

1042
00:55:17,357 --> 00:55:18,690
and you mother[bleep] are like,

1043
00:55:18,758 --> 00:55:20,826
"Oh, that evil, fat [bleep]."
You know.

1044
00:55:26,199 --> 00:55:28,166
I consider Seth an icon.
I do.

1045
00:55:28,234 --> 00:55:30,102
Like, I got a critique
about Seth.

1046
00:55:30,169 --> 00:55:32,671
It--it's too much Seth.

1047
00:55:32,739 --> 00:55:34,740
It's...

1048
00:55:34,807 --> 00:55:39,978
Like, it's almost like he's
jealous of his own creation.

1049
00:55:40,046 --> 00:55:43,982
Where he wants to prove
"I'm better than the cartoons."

1050
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:46,718
But he's not better
than the cartoons.

1051
00:55:46,786 --> 00:55:48,854
See, but I think
the problem is with Seth

1052
00:55:48,922 --> 00:55:50,489
is that he don't have
a partner,

1053
00:55:50,556 --> 00:55:52,791
you know,
like the <i>South Park</i> guys

1054
00:55:52,859 --> 00:55:54,159
or Hanna-Barbera.

1055
00:55:56,362 --> 00:55:58,163
I know we've read
that old story

1056
00:55:58,231 --> 00:56:01,433
that, uh, Hanna once said,
"I'm bigger than Yogi,"

1057
00:56:01,501 --> 00:56:06,271
and Barbera slapped the shit
out of him for saying that?

1058
00:56:06,339 --> 00:56:11,143
Seth needs a Barbera...

1059
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:14,146
To slap him and slap him twice.

1060
00:56:14,213 --> 00:56:18,216
Once to say, "Hey, man, don't
forget why people love you."

1061
00:56:18,284 --> 00:56:21,186
And two,
"Just say you're gay."

1062
00:56:21,254 --> 00:56:25,057
No...

1063
00:56:25,124 --> 00:56:28,260
No straight man
writes that many show tunes.

1064
00:56:28,328 --> 00:56:30,896
That's a fact.

1065
00:56:32,932 --> 00:56:34,666
I love Mike Tyson,
and I don't have much to say.

1066
00:56:34,734 --> 00:56:36,535
I'm just disappointed and hurt

1067
00:56:36,602 --> 00:56:40,605
at how much comfort white people
have around you now.

1068
00:56:40,673 --> 00:56:43,241
I don't--I don't like it.

1069
00:56:48,948 --> 00:56:50,315
And Steve-O,

1070
00:56:50,383 --> 00:56:52,651
this new, subdued,
"not drunk" you,

1071
00:56:52,719 --> 00:56:55,320
it [bleep] stinks, man.

1072
00:56:58,191 --> 00:57:01,293
Why are you still looking at me
like that, Mr. Shatner, sir?

1073
00:57:01,361 --> 00:57:03,095
Are you like, "Boy,
I had more for that [bleep].

1074
00:57:03,162 --> 00:57:04,463
I didn't say it.
I should have said it,

1075
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:05,998
'cause he's an asshole.

1076
00:57:06,065 --> 00:57:08,767
You're telling it as it is.

1077
00:57:08,835 --> 00:57:10,369
You're telling it like it is.

1078
00:57:10,436 --> 00:57:14,639
Jeff Ross, I love you, I guess.

1079
00:57:14,707 --> 00:57:17,542
Look, Jeff Ross is a legend.

1080
00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:19,244
His funniness is a legend.

1081
00:57:19,312 --> 00:57:22,014
But when I say "legend,"
I mean a myth...

1082
00:57:26,219 --> 00:57:28,620
Like the Loch Ness monster
or Bigfoot.

1083
00:57:28,688 --> 00:57:31,289
Like,
we all believe they exist,

1084
00:57:31,357 --> 00:57:33,959
but who really ever saw it?

1085
00:57:39,632 --> 00:57:41,299
Ah, shit.

1086
00:57:41,367 --> 00:57:43,235
I've turned down many roasts.

1087
00:57:43,302 --> 00:57:45,003
I have--
about three or four of 'em.

1088
00:57:45,071 --> 00:57:47,439
And I said yes to this,
and I'm dead-ass serious.

1089
00:57:47,507 --> 00:57:49,808
I said yes to this because, uh,

1090
00:57:49,876 --> 00:57:51,777
I respect Charlie Sheen.

1091
00:57:51,844 --> 00:57:54,379
I do.
I said yes 'cause I respe--

1092
00:57:54,447 --> 00:57:57,816
not--not--not
his body of work.

1093
00:57:57,884 --> 00:57:59,918
Like, not...

1094
00:57:59,986 --> 00:58:03,221
It's all been
very Christian Slater-ish.

1095
00:58:03,289 --> 00:58:05,257
Like it just, like...

1096
00:58:06,859 --> 00:58:09,227
He sucks, but he's good.

1097
00:58:09,295 --> 00:58:13,465
But he sucks at the same time.

1098
00:58:13,533 --> 00:58:17,302
Uh, I think
that his stand that he made,

1099
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:18,904
uh, against the business--

1100
00:58:18,971 --> 00:58:20,238
I think this
is a [bleep]-up business,

1101
00:58:20,306 --> 00:58:23,642
but he stood up,
he still survived,

1102
00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:26,344
uh, and he proved
that nobody can keep, like,

1103
00:58:26,412 --> 00:58:27,913
a Sheen down, you know?

1104
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:31,183
They can keep a Estevez down,
'cause his brother...

1105
00:58:34,087 --> 00:58:35,554
And he's the good one.

1106
00:58:35,621 --> 00:58:37,189
That mother[bleep]
do everything right,

1107
00:58:37,256 --> 00:58:38,523
and that [bleep] career
is over.

1108
00:58:38,591 --> 00:58:40,492
Holy shit.

1109
00:58:44,330 --> 00:58:45,697
[Bleep] tiger blood.

1110
00:58:45,765 --> 00:58:49,401
He's selling his own blood
to make money.

1111
00:58:49,469 --> 00:58:52,037
But I wanted to say
to your eyes, man,

1112
00:58:52,105 --> 00:58:54,072
I-I-I...

1113
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:57,075
I love that you stood up
to what you thought was wrong,

1114
00:58:57,143 --> 00:59:00,512
and, uh, I'm impressed by you,
and I wanted to say that.

1115
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:02,948
So thank you, man.
Thanks for having me.

1116
00:59:03,015 --> 00:59:04,883
Y'all take care.
Thank you.

1117
00:59:08,921 --> 00:59:11,750
Still to come,
Charlie Sheen goes off.

1118
00:59:11,870 --> 00:59:12,891
He's winning.

1119
00:59:12,959 --> 00:59:14,778
I mean, when you're winning,
you can take anything.

1120
00:59:14,898 --> 00:59:17,062
Give it as good
as you get it, my friend.

1121
00:59:17,130 --> 00:59:19,731
I hope all you clowns
are ready for my "sheenius."

1122
00:59:28,357 --> 00:59:30,258
And now it is time
for the moment

1123
00:59:30,326 --> 00:59:32,388
we've all been waiting for.

1124
00:59:32,703 --> 00:59:34,676
We're gonna get to hear
a ranting tirade

1125
00:59:34,796 --> 00:59:36,698
from the man himself.

1126
00:59:41,106 --> 00:59:42,974
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

1127
00:59:43,094 --> 00:59:45,052
I give you a man
with a big heart,

1128
00:59:45,172 --> 00:59:48,123
because it's been dangerously
enlarged by cocaine use,

1129
00:59:48,243 --> 00:59:50,400
Charlie Sheen.

1130
00:59:56,518 --> 00:59:59,654
♪ Wild thing ♪

1131
00:59:59,722 --> 01:00:04,225

1135
01:00:15,404 --> 01:00:18,906
Hi. Hello.

1136
01:00:18,974 --> 01:00:20,408
I'm Charlie.

1137
01:00:22,511 --> 01:00:23,711
Wow.

1138
01:00:23,779 --> 01:00:25,813
Wow [bleep] Wow.

1139
01:00:25,881 --> 01:00:28,750
What a night.

1140
01:00:28,817 --> 01:00:31,686
Until tonight, I never realized
how [bleep] up I was.

1141
01:00:34,256 --> 01:00:38,760
All this time, I thought
I was just having fun.

1142
01:00:39,995 --> 01:00:41,529
Yeah, it's true.
It's true.

1143
01:00:41,597 --> 01:00:44,399
I've hung around with a lot
of shady people over the years--

1144
01:00:44,466 --> 01:00:46,934
losers, drug addicts,

1145
01:00:47,002 --> 01:00:50,738
dealers, desperate whores.

1146
01:00:50,806 --> 01:00:54,175
But to have you all here
on one night is really special.

1147
01:00:59,948 --> 01:01:01,983
My thanks to Seth MacFarlane.

1148
01:01:02,051 --> 01:01:06,654
Great job tonight.

1149
01:01:06,722 --> 01:01:08,556
Look at you.
Look at you, Seth.

1150
01:01:08,624 --> 01:01:10,658
You've got the--
got the spray-on tan,

1151
01:01:10,726 --> 01:01:14,062
the waxed eyebrows,
the peck implants,

1152
01:01:14,129 --> 01:01:18,833
halogen teeth,
the bleached anus...

1153
01:01:18,901 --> 01:01:21,002
The scrotal tuck,

1154
01:01:21,070 --> 01:01:23,171
nipple enlargement,

1155
01:01:23,238 --> 01:01:26,974
taint augmentation.

1156
01:01:27,042 --> 01:01:30,878
But I got to admit, I envy you.

1157
01:01:30,946 --> 01:01:32,714
You've got boatloads of money,

1158
01:01:32,781 --> 01:01:34,315
three TV shows,

1159
01:01:34,383 --> 01:01:37,085
and still, even with
all the work you've had done,

1160
01:01:37,152 --> 01:01:40,655
you can talk down the street
totally unrecognized.

1161
01:01:43,225 --> 01:01:44,792
Yes.

1162
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:46,394
Yeah.

1163
01:01:46,462 --> 01:01:50,364
Tonight I put all
the craziness behind me.

1164
01:01:50,432 --> 01:01:52,700
I say let the past
stay in the past...

1165
01:01:52,768 --> 01:01:56,537
With Jon Lovitz.

1166
01:01:56,605 --> 01:01:59,507
Steve-O,
you're an animal, man.

1167
01:01:59,575 --> 01:02:03,244
People say I'm crazy,
but you, you're the real deal.

1168
01:02:03,312 --> 01:02:07,615
This guy actually got a tattoo
of his own face on his back.

1169
01:02:07,683 --> 01:02:10,084
There it is.
There it is.

1170
01:02:14,189 --> 01:02:15,990
Even he knows
it was a huge mistake,

1171
01:02:16,058 --> 01:02:17,158
because it makes

1172
01:02:17,226 --> 01:02:18,993
Johnny Knoxville's [bleep]
go soft.

1173
01:02:23,065 --> 01:02:25,133
Kate Walsh.

1174
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:29,303
I don't know anyone
who watches your show...

1175
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:32,073
Because I date women
who can still get their period.

1176
01:02:39,414 --> 01:02:42,650
Anthony Jeselnik.

1177
01:02:42,718 --> 01:02:46,420
I really liked
your slow, measured delivery.

1178
01:02:46,488 --> 01:02:49,724
It's as if you were trying to--
trying to savor the moment.

1179
01:02:49,792 --> 01:02:53,327
Years from now when you're
locking up at Radioshack...

1180
01:02:55,864 --> 01:02:58,232
You'll look back
at tonight and say...

1181
01:02:58,300 --> 01:02:59,867
"I...

1182
01:02:59,935 --> 01:03:03,404
"Wish...I...

1183
01:03:03,472 --> 01:03:05,873
"Was...

1184
01:03:05,941 --> 01:03:08,042
Funnier."

1185
01:03:11,847 --> 01:03:13,314
Goddamn.

1186
01:03:13,382 --> 01:03:15,583
Seriously, dude, the only
thing slower than your delivery

1187
01:03:15,651 --> 01:03:18,986
is Patrice O'Neal's metabolism.

1188
01:03:19,054 --> 01:03:21,022
When I first
saw Patrice on the stage,

1189
01:03:21,089 --> 01:03:23,391
I thought the same thing
we all did--

1190
01:03:23,458 --> 01:03:26,060
Why is Mike Tyson's
mother here?

1191
01:03:30,699 --> 01:03:32,266
But, Mike, no, no,
Mike, Mike, Mike,

1192
01:03:32,334 --> 01:03:34,635
- you were fantastic tonight.
- Oh, shit.

1193
01:03:34,703 --> 01:03:36,037
By the way, Mike,

1194
01:03:36,104 --> 01:03:38,372
I'm sorry for drinking
all the blood out of your tiger.

1195
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,842
I was going through
a weird phase.

1196
01:03:40,909 --> 01:03:43,845
Ah, look, there he is--

1197
01:03:43,912 --> 01:03:45,913
Jeff Ross.

1198
01:03:45,981 --> 01:03:48,916
Jeff, Jeff, that Gaddafi outfit
is perfect for you,

1199
01:03:48,984 --> 01:03:51,953
because you have what I would
call a Libyan face.

1200
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:55,056
By that, I mean
it's [bleep] revolting.

1201
01:03:57,926 --> 01:03:58,993
Oh, hey, look.
Look.

1202
01:03:59,061 --> 01:04:01,829
It's former funnyman
Jon Lovitz.

1203
01:04:01,897 --> 01:04:04,065
Just last week,
we were out on the golf course,

1204
01:04:04,132 --> 01:04:06,033
we chatted, had a few laughs,

1205
01:04:06,101 --> 01:04:08,870
then he got back
on the mower and drove off.

1206
01:04:12,708 --> 01:04:14,408
And Amy Schumer.

1207
01:04:14,476 --> 01:04:18,346
Great job.
You really [bleep] me tonight...

1208
01:04:18,413 --> 01:04:22,016
Which I dig, because
I'm into anonymous sex.

1209
01:04:22,084 --> 01:04:25,786
And no one's more
anonymous here than Amy Schumer.

1210
01:04:27,222 --> 01:04:29,657
I mean,
I'm Charlie [bleep] Sheen.

1211
01:04:29,725 --> 01:04:31,726
They know me on Mars.

1212
01:04:31,793 --> 01:04:35,129
They don't know you
in this room.

1213
01:04:35,197 --> 01:04:38,132
You know, I personally asked
that William Shatner be here,

1214
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:41,869
only because I needed
some clean urine.

1215
01:04:41,937 --> 01:04:43,104
I had to wring it
out of the diaper,

1216
01:04:43,171 --> 01:04:44,071
but it did the job.

1217
01:04:50,646 --> 01:04:53,814
Bill, you've always been
an inspiration to my acting.

1218
01:04:53,882 --> 01:04:55,182
It was your work on <i>Star Trek</i>

1219
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:57,318
that inspired me
to act like an asshole

1220
01:04:57,386 --> 01:05:00,087
until the rest of the cast
stopped speaking to me.

1221
01:05:04,593 --> 01:05:07,595
But, look, look,
this has been, um...

1222
01:05:07,663 --> 01:05:10,331
This has been both
enlightening and fun.

1223
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:13,067
You are all worthy adversaries.

1224
01:05:13,135 --> 01:05:14,769
But the thing is,

1225
01:05:14,836 --> 01:05:18,539
once again,
I have come out unscathed.

1226
01:05:25,013 --> 01:05:26,514
You can't hurt me.

1227
01:05:26,581 --> 01:05:30,251
Hell, I can't even hurt me.

1228
01:05:30,319 --> 01:05:32,887
Drugs couldn't kill me.

1229
01:05:32,955 --> 01:05:34,588
Sex couldn't kill me.

1230
01:05:34,656 --> 01:05:36,223
The press couldn't kill me.

1231
01:05:36,291 --> 01:05:41,462
<i>Two and a Half Men</i>
couldn't kill me.

1232
01:05:41,530 --> 01:05:43,364
Did you really think
your little jokes

1233
01:05:43,432 --> 01:05:46,667
were gonna hurt me?

1234
01:05:46,735 --> 01:05:49,170
I'm the wild thing--
Ricky [bleep] Vaughn, man.

1235
01:05:55,243 --> 01:05:58,579
You're looking at a guy
who thrives on chaos.

1236
01:05:58,647 --> 01:06:01,382
At ten years old, I was
on the set of <i>Apocalypse Now</i>

1237
01:06:01,450 --> 01:06:03,851
in the Philippine jungle,
playing with severed heads

1238
01:06:03,919 --> 01:06:06,320
in Colonel Kurtz's compound.

1239
01:06:06,388 --> 01:06:07,955
When I did <i>Ferris Bueller,</i>

1240
01:06:08,023 --> 01:06:10,992
my first line in the film
was "drugs?"

1241
01:06:11,059 --> 01:06:14,228
I thought they were asking me
how I wanted to be paid.

1242
01:06:20,168 --> 01:06:23,537
After <i>Platoon, Wall Street,</i>
and <i>Major League,</i>

1243
01:06:23,605 --> 01:06:26,741
I went on to have the biggest
salary on television.

1244
01:06:26,808 --> 01:06:29,810
Sounds great, right?
It was.

1245
01:06:29,878 --> 01:06:33,748
No, really.
It [bleep] was.

1246
01:06:33,815 --> 01:06:37,718
I did porn stars.
I did drugs.

1247
01:06:37,786 --> 01:06:40,821
I had my own television show.

1248
01:06:40,889 --> 01:06:42,490
And then...

1249
01:06:42,557 --> 01:06:44,725
Then I did the one thing
that everyone in America

1250
01:06:44,793 --> 01:06:47,595
really wishes they could do.

1251
01:06:47,662 --> 01:06:49,930
I told my boss to [bleep] off.

1252
01:06:56,638 --> 01:07:00,408
And then it was gone...

1253
01:07:00,475 --> 01:07:04,545
In one fiery
public flame-out.

1254
01:07:04,613 --> 01:07:07,048
And it was only
when the smoke cleared,

1255
01:07:07,115 --> 01:07:10,651
I realized just how lucky I am,

1256
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:13,187
because even after all that,

1257
01:07:13,255 --> 01:07:15,723
I still have a family
that loves me.

1258
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:21,996
That's why
they're not here tonight.

1259
01:07:22,064 --> 01:07:24,765
Yeah, they've--
they've seen me in jail.

1260
01:07:24,833 --> 01:07:27,101
They've seen me
rushed to emergency rooms.

1261
01:07:27,169 --> 01:07:29,270
They've seen me
dragged into court.

1262
01:07:29,337 --> 01:07:32,373
But seeing me on basic cable
would kill them.

1263
01:07:36,344 --> 01:07:37,678
But I know--
I know that my family

1264
01:07:37,746 --> 01:07:39,547
will always be there for me,

1265
01:07:39,614 --> 01:07:41,816
so...

1266
01:07:41,883 --> 01:07:43,984
What I'm trying to say is that

1267
01:07:44,052 --> 01:07:46,821
I'm done with "the winning,"

1268
01:07:46,888 --> 01:07:49,790
because I've already won.

1269
01:07:49,858 --> 01:07:51,859
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1270
01:07:57,332 --> 01:07:59,333
This roast may be over,

1271
01:07:59,401 --> 01:08:01,302
but I'm Charlie Sheen.

1272
01:08:01,369 --> 01:08:04,939
And in here--
in here burns

1273
01:08:05,006 --> 01:08:07,174
an eternal fire.

1274
01:08:08,810 --> 01:08:09,910
I just have to remember

1275
01:08:09,978 --> 01:08:13,581
to keep it away
from a crack pipe.

1276
01:08:13,648 --> 01:08:15,249
I'll see you all
in the next adventure.

1277
01:08:15,317 --> 01:08:18,552
I love you.
Good night. Thank you.

1279
01:08:37,172 --> 01:08:38,672
Mike.

1280
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:43,144
- Oh, he's doing it again?
- Yeah.

1281
01:08:43,211 --> 01:08:43,897
Come on, Steve-O.

1282
01:08:44,017 --> 01:08:45,987
- Don't hurt me.
- Oh!
