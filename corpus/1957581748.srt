00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:54,720
YOUR FATHER KNOWS A THING OR TWO

BOOTLEG WHISKEY

00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,070
PA!

315
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:19,180
BEING AROUND PLAYERS WHO DRINK
WILL NOT MAKE ME A DRUNK!

316
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:23,280
I'VE SEEN WHAT SPIRITS
CAN DO TO A MAN

317
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:29,790
AND I NEVER WANT TO SEE IT
AGAIN - NOT IN MY FAMILY.

318
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:33,060
WILLIAM, YOU'VE HEARD
US TALK ABOUT UNCLE FRANK?

319
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,930

320
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,260
HE DIED IN THE
GREAT WAR, RIGHT?

321
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:42,130
NO, HE DIDN'T
DIE IN THE WAR.

00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:44,140
HE DRANK HIMSELF
TO DEATH.

323
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:47,010
FINALLY HUNG HIMSELF
UP IN THE ATTIC.

324
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,140
WILLIAM, I HAD TO HELP
CUT HIM DOWN.

325
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:54,010
PA, I'M SORRY.

326
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:59,620
I TRULY HOPED I'D NEVER HAVE

327
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:02,790
PA, I'M STRONG
ENOUGH TO SAY NO.

328
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:08,630
YOU'D BE SURPRISED HOW EASY
IT MIGHT BE AFTER A WHILE,

329
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:12,030
JUST TO TASTE IT, WHEN EVERYBODY
ELSE AROUND YOU IS DOING IT.

330
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,030
NOT IF YOU
KNOW BETTER.

331
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,870
I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR ANY MORE.

332
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,880
PA, WE'RE NOT
DONE TALKING!

333
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,020
WHAT MORE
IS THERE TO SAY?

334
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:33,280
YOUR PARENTS ARE OPPOSED TO YOU
PLAYING BASEBALL AT A MILL.

335
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,290
PA, DON'T YOU
SEE?

336
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,290
I WANT THIS MORE THAN
ANYTHING I'VE EVER WANTED.

337
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:41,660
LIFE IS NOT ABOUT
GETTING WHAT YOU WANT.

338
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,360
IT'S NOT ABOUT
BEING MISERABLE!

339
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,200

340
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,930

346
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:31,780
A LITTLE I'VE SAVED UP.

347
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:35,050
SON, WILL YOU DO

00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:03,730
WRIGHT MAY BE NEWTON'S
LAST CHANCE FOR A WIN.

NOW HE'S AT THE PLATE...

693
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:12,340

00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:56,750
IT'S A LONG LINE DRIVE
WAY OUT TO CENTER FIELD.

707
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:58,750
THE CENTER FIELDER'S
BACK TO THE TREES.

NEWTON TAKES THE LEAD,
TWO TO ONE,

712
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,960
AND WILL WRIGHT HAS TIPPED
THE SCALES FOR HIS TEAM.

01:19:20,330 --> 01:19:21,800
CHARLES.

1035
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:25,900
I GREW UP
IN THE MILL.

1036
01:19:25,940 --> 01:19:28,170
MY DADDY
WAS BAD TO DRINK.

1037
01:19:28,210 --> 01:19:31,040
SO MY FOLKS NEVER TOLD
ME HOW TO BE SAVED.

1038
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:33,850
GROWING UP IN A CHRISTIAN
HOME WON'T SAVE ANYONE.

1039
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:35,810
MY OWN BOYS,

1040
01:19:35,850 --> 01:19:38,180
THEY HAVE THEIR STRUGGLES,
JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

1041
01:19:38,220 --> 01:19:40,320
EVERY SOUL MUST COME
TO CHRIST FOR HIMSELF.

1042
01:19:40,350 --> 01:19:42,220
IT'S NOT A
FAMILY DEAL.

1043
01:19:44,390 --> 01:19:47,890
HEY, UM, THIS HERE'S
MY FRIEND, WILL WRIGHT.

1044
01:19:47,930 --> 01:19:49,430
(MR. SUNDAY)
HELLO, WILL.

1045
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:51,060
WE PLAY BASEBALL
FOR NEWTON MILL.

1046
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:53,330
IS THAT RIGHT?

1047
01:19:53,370 --> 01:19:55,370
JOE JACKSON GOT HIS START
DOWN HERE, DIDN'T HE?

1048
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:56,300
THAT'S RIGHT, SIR!

1049
01:19:56,340 --> 01:19:58,440
OH, IT'S A GREAT GAME.
I LOVED IT DEARLY.

1050
01:19:58,470 --> 01:19:59,370
BUT, AS I
SHARED TONIGHT,

1051
01:19:59,410 --> 01:20:02,040
I FOUND A HIGHER CALLING
WHEN I FOUND CHRIST.

1052
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:04,340
THAT'S WHY YOU
LEFT BASEBALL?

1053
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:07,950
WELL, I PLAYED FOR A FEW
YEARS AFTER I GOT SAVED,

1054
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:09,920
BUT I FELT LIKE I WAS-

1055
01:20:09,950 --> 01:20:11,920
LIKE I WAS WEARIN'
SOMEONE ELSE'S SHOES.

1056
01:20:11,950 --> 01:20:13,320
I STILL LOVE THE GAME...

1057
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:15,590
YOU ROUNDED THE BASES
IN 14 SECONDS.

1058
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:17,520
AND NOW I ROUND THE PLATFORM
IN 2 HOURS.

1059
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:19,090
[CHUCKLES]

1060
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:23,060
YOU RECKON' YOU
COULD SIGN MY BIBLE?

1061
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:24,500
SURE.

1062
01:20:31,210 --> 01:20:32,040
NICE TO MEET YOU.

1063
01:20:32,070 --> 01:20:32,500
THANK YOU, SIR.

1064
01:20:41,980 --> 01:20:44,480
CHICK, WE'RE SO GLAD
FOR YOUR DECISION!

1065
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:47,850
THANK YOU
FER INVITIN' ME.

1066
01:20:47,890 --> 01:20:51,320
I'VE BEEN
PRAYIN' FOR YOU.

1067
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,490
THANKS FOR THET -
IMOGENE.

1068
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:05,100
HAVE YOU TALKED WITH HIM ABOUT
CHRIST BEFORE?

1069
01:21:05,140 --> 01:21:09,310
I DON'T RECOLLECT.
MAYBE I HAVE.

1070
01:21:09,340 --> 01:21:13,080
WILL - WHEN DID YOU
ASK CHRIST TO SAVE YOU?

1071
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:16,650
WHEN I WAS
REAL LITTLE.

1072
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:19,520
I CAN'T HARDLY
REMEMBER.

1073
01:21:19,550 --> 01:21:21,350
BUT YOU DO REMEMBER
IT HAPPENED?

1074
01:21:21,390 --> 01:21:24,960
YEAH, MY MA PRAYED
WITH ME.

1075
01:21:24,990 --> 01:21:27,060
MAY I SEE WHAT MR. SUNDAY
WROTE IN YOUR BIBLE?

1076
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:28,090
SURE.

1077
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:34,500
"TO WILL, KEEP YOUR EYES ON
THE LORD. W.A. SUNDAY."

1078
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:42,210
SO, UM, EZEKIEL, WHAT DID
YOU THINK OF MR. SUNDAY?

1079
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:45,610
WELL, I'M THANKFUL FOR HIS
STRONG STAND FOR RIGHT.

1080
01:21:45,650 --> 01:21:48,210
GRANTED THE WAY HE SLANGS
UP THE GOSPEL

1081
01:21:48,250 --> 01:21:50,480
IS A BIT UNDISTINGUISHED
FOR A PREACHER,

1082
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:54,250
BUT HE DOES SEEM TO CONNECT
WITH THE COMMON MAN-

1083
01:21:54,290 --> 01:21:56,190
WELL, I DIDN'T EXPECT
TO SEE YOU HERE!

1084
01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:58,960
WILL!
OH, MY DEAR BOY.

1085
01:22:01,230 --> 01:22:04,360
LIKE I SAID,
SHE'S A HUGGER.

1086
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:06,370
MA, I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET
A FRIEND OF MINE.

1087
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,200
YES, DEAR.
OF COURSE.

1088
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:09,470
THIS IS GINNIE DOUGLAS.

1089
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:11,470
SHE'S A SECRETARY
DOWN AT THE MILL.

1090
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:12,600
I'M PLEASED TO MEET YOU, MA'AM.

1091
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:14,210
AND I YOU,
GINNIE.

1092
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:15,370
HOW DO
YOU DO?

1093
01:22:15,410 --> 01:22:16,940
I KNOW
THE YOUNG LADY.

1094
01:22:16,980 --> 01:22:18,340
HOW ARE YOU,
VIRGINIA?

1095
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:20,010
I'M DOIN' FINE,
MR. HAMPTON.

1096
01:22:20,050 --> 01:22:21,150
IS YOUR
FATHER HERE?

1097
01:22:21,180 --> 01:22:23,620
YES, HE'S OUTSIDE GATHERING UP
THE BOYS IN THE TRUCK.

1098
01:22:23,650 --> 01:22:26,250
UH, VIRGINIA'S
FATHER IS RESPONSIBLE

1099
01:22:26,290 --> 01:22:29,090
FOR THE BOY'S RECREATION
DOWN AT THE MILL.

1100
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:31,490
IN FACT, IF YOU
WOULD EXCUSE ME,

1101
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:34,260
I'D LIKE TO GO THANK HIM FOR
BRINGING A GROUP OUT TONIGHT.

1102
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:36,090
LADIES.

1103
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,340
MR. HAMPTON TELLS ME YOU'RE AN
APPRENTICE MACHINIST, WILLIAM.

1104
01:22:46,370 --> 01:22:48,140
WELL HE'S JUST
PUTTING IT KINDLY.

1105
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:50,410
I JUST LOOK
AFTER THE LOOMS

1106
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:51,610
AND THEN IF SOMETHING
GOES WRONG THEN,

1107
01:22:51,650 --> 01:22:55,110
I GO AND GET
REAL HELP.

1108
01:22:55,150 --> 01:22:57,220
WILL'S TOLD ME
ALL ABOUT YA.

1109
01:22:57,250 --> 01:22:58,620
GOOD THINGS,
I HOPE?

1110
01:22:58,650 --> 01:22:59,850
YES.

1111
01:22:59,890 --> 01:23:03,150
I'M SO PLEASED TO HEAR ABOUT THE
PROMISE YOU ASKED HIM TO KEEP.

1112
01:23:03,190 --> 01:23:05,090
HE TOLD YOU?

1113
01:23:05,130 --> 01:23:07,630
WELL,
I'M GLAD HE DID.

1114
01:23:07,660 --> 01:23:09,030
(MA)
WILL?

1115
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:10,760
YES, MA?

1116
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:12,530
I'M THANKFUL THAT YOU HAVEN'T
FORGOTTEN THE PROMISE

1117
01:23:12,570 --> 01:23:16,070
THAT YOU MADE TO ME THE NIGHT
YOU LEFT HOME.

1118
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:20,110
CAN YOU LOOK ME IN THE EYE
AND TELL ME YOU'VE KEPT IT?

1119
01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:21,740
MA, THIS IS HARDLY
THE TIME OR PLACE

1120
01:23:21,780 --> 01:23:23,780
TO BE TALKING ABOUT
PERSONAL MATTERS.

1121
01:23:23,810 --> 01:23:25,540
WHAT IS THERE
TO TALK ABOUT?

1122
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:27,650
OKAY,
I TRIED IT.

1123
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:29,410
BUT I HATED IT.

1124
01:23:29,450 --> 01:23:30,620
I JUST PROMISED MY PAL
THE OTHER DAY

1125
01:23:30,650 --> 01:23:33,620
THAT I WOULD NOT EVEN
TOUCH ANOTHER DROP.

1126
01:23:33,650 --> 01:23:36,620
WILL,
I'M DISAPPOINTED.

1127
01:23:36,660 --> 01:23:42,360
IT'S OKAY, MA,
I'M DONE FOR GOOD.

1128
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:46,270
WILL, WILL YOU COME
HOME FOR A VISIT?

1129
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:50,700
I CAN'T, MA.
I'M SORRY.

1130
01:23:50,740 --> 01:23:54,640
I'M A JUST A BIT TIED UP
TONIGHT.

1131
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:57,480
PA, YOU'LL BE GLAD TO KNOW
I'M HITTING WELL.

1132
01:23:57,510 --> 01:23:59,340
I MIGHT MAKE IT
OUT OF THE MILL.

1133
01:23:59,380 --> 01:24:01,380
IS THAT RIGHT?

1134
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:05,350
WELL, IF NOT TONIGHT,

1135
01:24:05,390 --> 01:24:10,360
MAYBE SOME SUNDAY YOU CAN MAKE
IT HOME AND BRING YOUR FRIENDS.

1136
01:24:10,390 --> 01:24:13,360
I'LL SEE IF I CAN MAKE
THAT WORK, MA.

1137
01:24:13,390 --> 01:24:15,530
WE'D BETTER GO.

1138
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:28,510
SO ANYWAY, PEP,
THIS MR. SUNDAY

1139
01:24:28,540 --> 01:24:31,840
HE DELIVERS HIS SERMONS
LIKE A MAN ON FIRE.

1140
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:36,150
SAYS IT DON'T MATTER
HOW RICH YA ARE-

1141
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:40,220
OR HOW SMART YA ARE-

1142
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:41,690
OR EVEN HOW FAMOUS.

1143
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:44,790
EVEN IF YOU MAKE THE HALL OF
FAME- IT AIN'T GOOD ENOUGH.

1144
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:51,400
YOU GOTTA PUT YER
FAITH IN CHRIST ALONE.

1145
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:58,100
OH, SPANGLER,
ARE YOU PREACHIN' OR PITCHIN'?

1146
01:24:58,140 --> 01:24:59,270
I'M PITCHIN'.

1147
01:24:59,310 --> 01:25:02,410
THEN SHUT UP
AND PITCH.

1148
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:06,510
'TWEEN YOUR FOOL PREACHIN' AND
YOUR BROTHER'S FOOL SNAKE BITE,

1149
01:25:06,550 --> 01:25:09,650
WE'RE THE WORSE OFF
FOR THE BOTH A' YA.

1150
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:14,250
AND AS FOR YOU, WRIGHT, YOU
LOOK LIKE YOU'RE SLEEP WALKIN'.

1151
01:25:14,290 --> 01:25:16,290
LET'S SEE SOME
PEP OUT THERE.

1152
01:25:36,910 --> 01:25:41,110
[MUSIC]

1153
01:25:51,290 --> 01:25:53,790
READY TO GO?

1154
01:25:53,830 --> 01:25:57,300
I...I GOTTA GET SOMETHING
TO DRINK.

1155
01:25:57,330 --> 01:25:58,930
I THOUGHT YA'S
ON TH' WAGON.

1156
01:25:58,970 --> 01:26:02,770
YEAH, I JUST,
I DON'T KNOW.

1157
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:04,800
I JUST DON'T
FEEL LIKE MYSELF.

1158
01:26:08,210 --> 01:26:11,240
WILL, YOU BETTER
STAY AWAY FROM IT.

1159
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:13,310
LOOK, I'M GLAD YOU'RE A
CHRISTIAN NOW AND EVERYTHING,

1160
01:26:13,350 --> 01:26:15,250
BUT JUST CUT IT OUT,
DOGGONE IT!!!

1161
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:16,810
WHEN YA FIRST COME,
YA NEVER TOUCHED IT.

1162
01:26:16,850 --> 01:26:20,650
WHEN I FIRST CAME,
YOU WANTED ME TO!

1163
01:26:20,690 --> 01:26:24,790
I'M AS SORRY AS
I KIN BE FOR THET.

1164
01:26:24,820 --> 01:26:30,530
YOU KNOW THE BIBLE SAYS TAKE
A LITTLE WINE FOR THE STOMACH.

1165
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:34,670
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT,
DID YOU?

1166
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:36,930
YOU'RE USIN' THE BIBLE
TO JUSTIFY BOOZE?

1167
01:26:36,970 --> 01:26:39,940
HEY, MR. HOLY ROLLER,
JUST QUIT TRYIN' TO SHOVE

1168
01:26:39,970 --> 01:26:42,440
RELIGION DOWN EVERYBODY
ELSE'S THROAT!

1169
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:07,550
HEY, JOHN.

1170
01:27:07,590 --> 01:27:09,350
HEY, CHICK.

1171
01:27:09,390 --> 01:27:11,450
HEY, CAN YOU GIVE ME
A HAND A SECOND?

1172
01:27:11,490 --> 01:27:13,290
SURE, WHAT DO
YOU NEED?

1173
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:15,660
TURN THAT THING
ABOUT A QUARTER TURN.

1174
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:23,470
OH, YEAH, THAT'S
GOOD, THAT'S GOOD.

1175
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:26,300
THANK YOU.

1176
01:27:26,340 --> 01:27:28,800
CAN I ASK
YA SOMETHIN'?

1177
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:31,270
SURE.

1178
01:27:31,310 --> 01:27:34,680
D'YA KNOW CHRISTIANS
THET DRINK?

1179
01:27:34,710 --> 01:27:39,750
THAT'S A LONG STORY.

1180
01:27:39,780 --> 01:27:42,420
THERE ARE SOME
CHRISTIANS THAT DRINK.

1181
01:27:42,450 --> 01:27:45,820
WHOLE DENOMINATIONS
ALLOW "MODERATE DRINK."

1182
01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:49,020
I DON'T SEE HOW
THEY CAN JUSTIFY IT,

1183
01:27:49,060 --> 01:27:52,430
BUT THEY SAY AS LONG
AS THEY DRINK IN PRIVATE

1184
01:27:52,460 --> 01:27:57,630
OR DRINK JUST A LITTLE BIT THEY
WON'T HEAR ANY DIFFERENT-

1185
01:27:57,670 --> 01:27:59,970
EVEN THOUGH IT'S AGAINST
THE LAW OF THE LAND.

1186
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,370
BUT THERE'S ONE THING
I DON'T HEAR 'EM SAY.

1187
01:28:03,410 --> 01:28:05,710
(CHICK)
WHAT?

1188
01:28:05,740 --> 01:28:07,310
(JOHN) THEY DON'T SAY
THEY'RE DRINKING

1189
01:28:07,340 --> 01:28:10,310
SO THAT GOD WILL BE
GLORIFIED IN THEIR LIVES.

1190
01:28:10,350 --> 01:28:11,580
(CHICK)
RECKON NOT.

1191
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:13,080
(JOHN)
BUT THAT IS BIBLE.

1192
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:14,950
"WHETHER THEREFORE,
YE EAT, OR DRINK,

1193
01:28:14,990 --> 01:28:19,820
OR WHATSOEVER YOU DO,
DO ALL TO THE GLORY OF GOD."

1194
01:28:19,860 --> 01:28:22,860
PEOPLE DON'T OFTEN THINK
ABOUT GOD'S GLORY.

1195
01:28:22,890 --> 01:28:28,430
THEY THINK ABOUT THEIR
OWN PLEASURES INSTEAD.

1196
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:32,430
(CHICK) SO YOU THINK
PROHIBITION'S TH' RIGHT THING?

1197
01:28:32,470 --> 01:28:35,100
(JOHN) WELL, THIS
MAY SURPRISE YOU,

1198
01:28:35,140 --> 01:28:39,110
BUT SOMETIMES I WORRY ABOUT
THE EFFECTS OF PROHIBITION.

1199
01:28:39,140 --> 01:28:40,910
I FEEL LIKE
IT'S MADE IT HARDER

1200
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:42,980
TO REACH SOME PEOPLE
WITH THE GOSPEL.

1201
01:28:43,010 --> 01:28:44,780
REALLY?

1202
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:46,580
IF CHRISTIANS EVER
COME TO THE PLACE

1203
01:28:46,620 --> 01:28:48,680
WHERE WE THINK WE CAN
MAKE PEOPLE ACT LIKE

1204
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:53,090
THEY KNOW THE LORD EVEN WHEN
THEY DON'T, THEY'LL HATE US.

1205
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:55,420
AND MAYBE RIGHTLY SO.

1206
01:28:55,460 --> 01:28:58,690
THE CHOICE TO COME TO CHRIST
IS A CHOICE MADE IN THE HEART.

1207
01:28:58,730 --> 01:29:01,100
IT CAN'T BE FORCED
ON SOMEONE.

1208
01:29:01,130 --> 01:29:04,830
NOW, I KNOW THAT LIQUOR
IS THE BANE OF OUR SOCIETY.

1209
01:29:04,870 --> 01:29:08,840
AND I KNOW THAT LIVES ARE BEING
SAVED BY THE 18TH AMENDMENT.

1210
01:29:08,870 --> 01:29:11,610
BUT THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM
IS STILL SIN

1211
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:14,480
AND THE ONLY WAY TO GET TO
THAT ROOT IS FOR JESUS CHRIST

1212
01:29:14,510 --> 01:29:19,580
TO CHANGE THE HEART OF A MAN
FROM THE INSIDE OUT.

1213
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:22,850
MY PA WUZ
BAD T' DRINK.

1214
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:27,660
HE LEFT AFTER LITTLE
BO COME 'LONG,

1215
01:29:27,690 --> 01:29:31,830
WENT BACK T' TH' MOUNTAINS
T' SELL MOONSHINE.

1216
01:29:31,860 --> 01:29:35,700
HE GOT REAL MEAN WHENEVER HE
GOT A SNOOTFUL OF THE STUFF,

1217
01:29:35,730 --> 01:29:41,570
SO WE WERE KINDA HAPPY
WHEN HE FINALLY TOOK OFF.

1218
01:29:41,610 --> 01:29:44,170
I HATE T' SAY IT.

1219
01:29:44,210 --> 01:29:46,910
I'M SORRY TO HEAR
THAT, CHICK.

1220
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:53,010
GIVE ME A HAND.

1221
01:29:59,190 --> 01:30:01,060
PICK IT UP JUST A LITTLE.

1222
01:30:01,090 --> 01:30:02,890
THERE YOU GO.

1223
01:30:02,930 --> 01:30:09,730
ALRIGHT.

1224
01:30:09,770 --> 01:30:12,430
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M DOIN' WRONG.

1225
01:30:12,470 --> 01:30:14,700
I'VE ONLY BEEN A CHRISTIAN
FOR A FEW DAYS.

1226
01:30:14,740 --> 01:30:17,570
BUT, IT SEEMS NO ONE ON
THE TEAM KIN STAND ME.

1227
01:30:17,610 --> 01:30:18,710
EVEN WILL.

1228
01:30:18,740 --> 01:30:22,110
HE SAID I'M ACTIN'
LIKE A HOLY ROLLER.

1229
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:23,440
WILL SAID THAT?

1230
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:26,110
YES, SIR.

1231
01:30:26,150 --> 01:30:31,120
BUT THEN, I GIVE HIM
HIS FIRST DRINK.

1232
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:33,020
I KNOW I'LL HAVE
TO ANSWER FOR THAT.

1233
01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:35,990
GINNIE TOLD ME HE TOOK
A PLEDGE NOT TO DRINK.

1234
01:30:36,030 --> 01:30:39,860
I THINK HE DID,
THEN HE WENT OFF IT.

1235
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:45,870
I'M AFRAID HE GOT
A TASTE FOR IT NOW.

1236
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:48,740
WELL, MAYBE YOU AND I -
OR GINNIE -

1237
01:30:48,770 --> 01:30:50,870
ONE OF US CAN
TALK TO HIM.

1238
01:30:50,910 --> 01:30:53,510
DO YOU KNOW FOR SURE HE'S
A BORN AGAIN CHRISTIAN?

1239
01:30:53,540 --> 01:30:55,740
I RECKON.

1240
01:30:55,780 --> 01:30:58,150
HE DON'T TALK MUCH
ABOUT IT, THOUGH.

1241
01:31:02,150 --> 01:31:05,720

COULD TAKE FRIDAY OFF?

IF I BRUNG WILL ALONG, TOO?

HIMSELF TO DEATH, AS THEY SAY.

1303

THAT'S WHY HE NEVER
WANTED EITHER OF US BOYS

TO EVEN TOUCH IT.

THEN, WHAT POSSESSED
YOU TO DO IT?

1306

ENOUGH TO MAKE MY OWN CHOICES

1307

MY PARENTS SAID.

1308

01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:43,460
PIKE!

1416
01:43:55,310 --> 01:43:59,410
IT'S A BAD BUMP, BUT HE'S
BREATHING STEADILY NOW.

1417
01:43:59,450 --> 01:44:01,480
AND HE'S GOING
TO BE OKAY.

1418
01:44:14,430 --> 01:44:17,660
WILL,
BO'S NOT DEAD.

1419
01:44:17,700 --> 01:44:19,660
HE'S KNOCKED OUT
BUT HE AIN'T DEAD.

1420
01:44:19,700 --> 01:44:21,300
DON'T DO
ANYTHING CRAZY!

1421
01:44:21,330 --> 01:44:22,600
JUST LEAVE
ME ALONE.

1422
01:44:22,630 --> 01:44:26,740
NO, I'M NOT GOIN'
ANYWHERE.

1423
01:44:26,770 --> 01:44:27,540
THEN I'LL GO-

1424
01:44:27,570 --> 01:44:29,670
NO, YOU'RE STAYIN'
'TIL WE TALK.

1425
01:44:29,710 --> 01:44:33,310
THERE'S NOTHING
TO TALK ABOUT.

1426
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:35,810
ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT WAS HOW
MUCH I HATED YOUR BROTHER.

1427
01:44:35,850 --> 01:44:38,950
HOW I WANTED
TO HURT HIM BAD.

1428
01:44:38,990 --> 01:44:40,550
BUT IF BO DIES-

1429
01:44:40,590 --> 01:44:41,690
BO AIN'T GONNA DIE.

1430
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:42,820
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT!

1431
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:46,290
I KNOW HE'S
IN GOD'S HANDS.

1432
01:44:46,330 --> 01:44:47,660
WE KIN PRAY FOR HIM.

1433
01:44:47,690 --> 01:44:52,330
DON'T - TALK TO ME -
ABOUT GOD!

1434
01:44:52,370 --> 01:44:54,600
YOU WON'T EVEN
PRAY FOR HIM?

1435
01:44:54,630 --> 01:44:56,470
GOD WON'T HEAR
MY PRAYER.

1436
01:44:56,500 --> 01:44:57,940
SURE HE WILL.

1437
01:44:57,970 --> 01:44:59,300
GOD HEARS
ALL PRAYERS.

1438
01:44:59,340 --> 01:45:01,670
YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR
BIBLE LIKE I DO.

1439
01:45:01,710 --> 01:45:04,470
THE BIBLE SAYS IF THERE'S SIN
IN MY HEART, GOD WON'T HEAR ME.

1440
01:45:04,510 --> 01:45:07,710
THEN GET RID
OF THE SIN.

1441
01:45:07,750 --> 01:45:10,680
THET'S ALL THE BIBLE
I DO KNOW.

1442
01:45:10,720 --> 01:45:15,420
MR. SUNDAY SAID, IF YA TURN FROM
YER SIN, GOD'LL FORGIVE YA.

1443
01:45:15,450 --> 01:45:17,350
HE WANTS TO.

1444
01:45:17,390 --> 01:45:19,420
THAT'S ALL THERE IS
TO BEIN' A CHRISTIAN

1445
01:45:19,460 --> 01:45:22,630
JUST ASKIN' JESUS FORGIVENESS
FOR YER SINS.

1446
01:45:22,660 --> 01:45:24,690
IT'S NOT
THAT SIMPLE.

1447
01:45:24,730 --> 01:45:27,600
WHY NOT?

1448
01:45:27,630 --> 01:45:30,400
MY WHOLE LIFE
IS A LIE.

1449
01:45:30,440 --> 01:45:33,070
I'VE ALWAYS SAID WHATEVER
PEOPLE WANTED TO HEAR.

1450
01:45:33,110 --> 01:45:36,340
BUT IN MY HEART I NEVER
TURNED FROM MY SIN.

1451
01:45:36,380 --> 01:45:38,110
YA KIN CHANGE THET.

1452
01:45:38,140 --> 01:45:41,810
I'VE HEARD ABOUT BEING
A CHRISTIAN FOR SO LONG-

1453
01:45:41,850 --> 01:45:43,550
IT'S NOTHIN'
BUT WORDS.

1454
01:45:43,580 --> 01:45:45,720
DON'T JIST
SAY THE WORDS.

1455
01:45:45,750 --> 01:45:46,820
MEAN 'EM.

1456
01:45:46,850 --> 01:45:49,820
IT AIN'T THET
HARD TO DO.

1457
01:45:49,860 --> 01:45:52,460
I WOULDN'T EVEN
KNOW HOW...

1458
01:45:52,490 --> 01:45:55,430
WILL, ARE YA SORRY
FOR YER SINS?

1459
01:45:55,460 --> 01:45:56,690
I AM.

1460
01:45:56,730 --> 01:45:58,430
DON'T TELL ME.

1461
01:45:58,460 --> 01:46:00,330
TELL HIM.

1462
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:08,370
I AM SORRY
FOR MY SIN.

1463
01:46:08,410 --> 01:46:12,080
GOD, I'M SORRY FOR GOING AGAINST
YOU AND GOING MY OWN WAY -

1464
01:46:12,110 --> 01:46:13,940
FOR SAYIN' THAT
I WAS A CHRISTIAN

1465
01:46:13,980 --> 01:46:18,980
AND DOIN' WHATEVER
I WANTED TO DO.

1466
01:46:19,020 --> 01:46:23,120
I'M SORRY - FOR EVERYTHING
THAT I'VE DONE AGAINST YOU.

1467
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:27,460
GOD, FORGIVE ME
FOR MY SIN.

1468
01:46:27,490 --> 01:46:29,060
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

1469
01:46:35,530 --> 01:46:36,830
WERE YA JUST PRETENDIN'?

1470
01:46:36,870 --> 01:46:39,970
NO.

1471
01:46:40,010 --> 01:46:43,970
LET'S PRAY
FOR BO. OKAY?

1472
01:46:44,010 --> 01:46:45,810
YEAH.
OKAY.

1473
01:46:52,720 --> 01:46:53,720
[KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK]

1474
01:46:53,750 --> 01:46:55,590
YEAH.

1475
01:46:55,620 --> 01:46:56,850
CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE?

1476
01:46:56,890 --> 01:46:58,590
SURE, COME ON IN.

1477
01:47:04,600 --> 01:47:06,630
I HEARD ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED.

1478
01:47:06,670 --> 01:47:08,500
BUT, YOU DIDN'T HEAR
ALL OF IT.

1479
01:47:08,530 --> 01:47:10,470
I ASKED THE LORD
TO SAVE ME.

1480
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:11,970
IS THAT RIGHT?

1481
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,870
I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO LOOK
SOMEONE IN THE EYE BEFORE

1482
01:47:13,910 --> 01:47:16,570
AND TELL THEM THAT
I KNOW I'M A CHRISTIAN.

1483
01:47:16,610 --> 01:47:19,180
BUT I CAN TODAY.

1484
01:47:19,210 --> 01:47:21,610
THAT'S AN ANSWER
TO PRAYER, WILL.

1485
01:47:25,050 --> 01:47:27,420
BUT THERE'S STILL SO
MUCH I DON'T KNOW.

1486
01:47:30,620 --> 01:47:32,720
WHEN I LEFT HOME -
THAT WAS WRONG.

1487
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:34,020
WHEN I BROKE MY PROMISE
AND STARTED TO DRINK -

1488
01:47:34,060 --> 01:47:36,760
THAT WAS WRONG.

1489
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:39,500
LETTING MY TEAM DOWN BECAUSE
OF MY DRINKIN'...IS MORE WRONG.

1490
01:47:39,530 --> 01:47:42,470
LYING AND ACTIN' LIKE
I'M SOMETHING I WASN'T.

1491
01:47:43,940 --> 01:47:45,970
I'M SO WRONG;
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET RIGHT!

1492
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:49,010
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF I SHOULD
PLAY BASEBALL ANYMORE.

1493
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:51,980
IT'S BEEN MY
WHOLE LIFE -

1494
01:47:52,010 --> 01:47:55,010
I - I JUST
DON'T KNOW!

1495
01:47:59,820 --> 01:48:03,650
IS BASEBALL
REALLY THE PROBLEM?

1496
01:48:03,690 --> 01:48:05,260
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1497
01:48:05,290 --> 01:48:08,930
WELL, WHAT DID
BILLY SUNDAY SAY?

1498
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:11,800
HE SAID HE DIDN'T HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH THE GAME ITSELF.

1499
01:48:11,830 --> 01:48:15,730
HE SAID HE FOUND
A HIGHER CALLING.

1500
01:48:15,770 --> 01:48:18,770
YOU'VE GOT A NATURAL
GIFT FOR BASEBALL.

1501
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:21,570
I'VE WATCHED YOU DEVELOP IT
ALL SEASON.

1502
01:48:21,610 --> 01:48:24,610
YOU'VE GOT A GIFT FOR
WORKING WITH THE BOYS.

1503
01:48:24,640 --> 01:48:26,840
I'VE SEEN THAT
THIS SUMMER, TOO.

1504
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:30,280
MAYBE YOU CAN FIND A WAY TO
TAKE ALL THAT GOD'S GIVEN YOU

1505
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:33,850
AND BRING GLORY TO HIM.

1506
01:48:33,890 --> 01:48:36,250
I'M WILLING TO DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

1507
01:48:36,290 --> 01:48:38,990
THEN HE'LL MAKE IT
CLEAR TO YOU.

1508
01:48:39,020 --> 01:48:42,130
"IN ALL THY WAYS
ACKNOWLEDGE HIM."

1509
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:44,600
HE'LL DIRECT YOU.

1510
01:48:44,630 --> 01:48:47,730
FIRST OFF, I HAVE A LOT OF
APOLOGIES I NEED TO MAKE.

1511
01:48:47,770 --> 01:48:50,730
SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD START.

1512
01:48:50,770 --> 01:48:52,070
CAN I SPEAK TO GINNIE?

1513
01:48:52,100 --> 01:48:54,700
WILL! BO'S AWAKE!
HE'S FINE!!

1514
01:48:57,040 --> 01:48:58,840
HE JUST WOKE UP.
HE'S GONNA BE ALRIGHT.

1515
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:00,010
CAN I GO SEE HIM?

1516
01:49:00,050 --> 01:49:01,750
THET'S WHY I COME
TO GET YA!

1517
01:49:04,020 --> 01:49:04,980
CAN I COME
BACK LATER?

1518
01:49:05,020 --> 01:49:06,950
SURE, GO ON.

1519
01:49:18,330 --> 01:49:22,870
MRS. SPANGLER, I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT WHAT I DID.

1520
01:49:22,900 --> 01:49:26,000
HAS BO -
IS HE AWAKE YET?

1521
01:49:26,040 --> 01:49:28,140
DOC SAYS IT WILL TAKE A COUPLE
OF DAYS FOR THE GOOSE EGG

1522
01:49:28,170 --> 01:49:30,070
TO GO DOWN
BUT HE'LL BE FINE.

1523
01:49:30,110 --> 01:49:31,340
HE'S UP.

1524
01:49:31,380 --> 01:49:33,280
I'M SO GLAD
TO HEAR THAT.

1525
01:49:33,310 --> 01:49:34,410
IS IT OKAY IF
I GO AND SEE HIM?

1526
01:49:34,450 --> 01:49:37,710
AS A MATTER OF FACT, HE
ASKED ABOUT YOU FIRST THING.

1527
01:49:37,750 --> 01:49:38,580
REALLY?

1528
01:49:38,620 --> 01:49:39,820
YES.

1529
01:49:39,850 --> 01:49:42,720
HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T
FEEL BAD ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED!

1530
01:49:42,750 --> 01:49:44,120
HE DOES?

1531
01:49:44,160 --> 01:49:45,990
THERE IS NOTHIN'
YOU CAN DO

1532
01:49:46,020 --> 01:49:50,030
TO DIM THAT BOY'S ADMIRATION

01:50:10,650 --> 01:50:14,750
IT DOES KINDA SEEM LIKE YOU'RE
BOUNCING OFF THE CLOUDS.

1538
01:50:14,790 --> 01:50:18,150

TRYIN' TO ACT LIKE I WAS FREE -

1539

1542
01:50:23,700 --> 01:50:25,300
WELL, THAT
I DON'T KNOW.

1543
01:50:25,330 --> 01:50:27,030
I APOLOGIZED TO THE TEAM
AT PRACTICE,

1544
01:50:27,070 --> 01:50:29,130
BUT SCOOP SAYS
HE STILL WON'T PLAY ME.

1545
01:50:29,170 --> 01:50:30,630
I CAN'T BLAME HIM.

1546
01:50:30,670 --> 01:50:32,200
THEN THE SCOUT MIGHT
NOT SEE YA PLAY?

1547
01:50:32,240 --> 01:50:33,270
HE MIGHT NOT.

1548
01:50:33,310 --> 01:50:34,440
BUT WHO KNOWS?

1549
01:50:34,470 --> 01:50:36,810
MAYBE SCOOP'LL CHANGE HIS TUNE
IF I SHOW UP AND ACT RIGHT.

1550
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:38,070
I HOPE SO.

1551
01:50:38,110 --> 01:50:40,780
IT USED TO MEAN THE WORLD TO ME
IF I CAUGHT THE EYE OF A SCOUT.

1552
