1
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:15,761
Oh, thank you very much.

2
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:18,097
Uh, may I trouble you
for a pillow?

3
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,098
Sure.

4
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,474
Great. Thank you.

5
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:40,619
Excuse me.

6
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,165
I guess we're going
to be a while.

7
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:48,836
Ha ha ha!
You're funny.

8
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:55,551
The temperature in Miami...

9
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:57,136
is currently 86 degrees
and muggy.

10
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:59,180
We will be starting
our descent for landing...

11
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:00,181
in just a few moments.

12
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:03,100
Herman Gotlieb...

13
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:05,644
Gotlieb.

14
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,396
Please remain seated
with your seat belts on...

15
00:03:07,438 --> 00:03:10,774
until the captain has
turned off the seat belt sign.

16
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:25,164
All passengers
holding tickets...

17
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:27,875
to Eastern Flight 162
to Tampa...

18
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:30,211
please come
to the ticket counter.

19
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:40,335
Hey.

20
00:03:40,377 --> 00:03:42,796
Wow! Thanks.

21
00:03:45,882 --> 00:03:49,636
All passengers leaving
on Flight 266...

22
00:03:49,678 --> 00:03:51,263
please go directly
to the check-in desk...

23
00:03:51,304 --> 00:03:52,806
at Gate 6.

24
00:03:52,848 --> 00:03:54,808
All passengers leaving...

25
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,810
Hi.

26
00:03:56,852 --> 00:03:59,813
Please go directly
to the check-in desk...

27
00:03:59,855 --> 00:04:01,815
Hi.

28
00:04:01,857 --> 00:04:04,943
Hi there.
Going home?

29
00:04:04,985 --> 00:04:06,194
I'd like to tell you
about a book.

30
00:04:06,236 --> 00:04:08,488
It's a classic
of the Vedic literature...

31
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,073
"The Knowledge of God."

32
00:04:12,242 --> 00:04:14,578
Have you seen
the movie "Gandhi?"

33
00:04:16,872 --> 00:04:19,291
My name's Ravindra.
What's your name?

34
00:04:19,332 --> 00:04:20,876
Trouble.

35
00:05:02,576 --> 00:05:04,453
Mr. Gotlieb...

36
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,085
You know,
anything you want.

37
00:05:11,126 --> 00:05:14,254
Hey, send me up
a girl, Pablo. Now.

38
00:05:14,338 --> 00:05:16,298
You got any
of that hundred...

39
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,716
I gave you last week?

40
00:05:17,758 --> 00:05:19,718
I got all of it, man...

41
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,595
but I'm not lending you
no more money.

42
00:05:21,637 --> 00:05:23,097
Come on, Blink.

43
00:05:23,138 --> 00:05:24,807
Look. 50 bucks
till payday.

44
00:05:30,826 --> 00:05:33,286
Moseley. Homicide.

45
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,540
A what died?

46
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:39,501
All right.
Right away.

47
00:05:41,545 --> 00:05:43,338
I'll pay to find
the dumbbell killers.

48
00:05:43,338 --> 00:05:45,799
What's it worth to you?

49
00:05:47,342 --> 00:05:50,804
$61.35.

50
00:05:50,846 --> 00:05:52,722
$65.59.

51
00:05:57,907 --> 00:05:58,867
Thanks, Blink.

52
00:05:58,908 --> 00:06:01,244
Hey, man,
replace your teeth.

53
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:17,945
Hi.

54
00:06:19,155 --> 00:06:21,157
Pablo sent me.

55
00:06:26,704 --> 00:06:28,664
How old are you, anyway?

56
00:06:28,706 --> 00:06:31,918
19...and my name is Pepper.

57
00:06:34,045 --> 00:06:36,506
You got a driver's license
on you, Pepper?

58
00:06:48,392 --> 00:06:52,063
What's wrong
with Susan Waggoner?

59
00:06:52,104 --> 00:06:53,940
You know, Susie...

60
00:06:53,981 --> 00:06:56,692
this license here says
you're 23 years old.

61
00:06:56,734 --> 00:06:58,736
I know what it says.

62
00:07:00,112 --> 00:07:01,864
You can call me Junior.

63
00:07:03,366 --> 00:07:05,076
You around a size 7?

64
00:07:05,117 --> 00:07:06,744
Where?

65
00:07:06,786 --> 00:07:08,538
Dress.

66
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:10,248
Oh.

67
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:12,291
Uh, 6.

68
00:07:14,127 --> 00:07:15,878
Sometimes 7.

69
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,879
Depends on...

70
00:07:16,921 --> 00:07:18,256
Here. Try this on.

71
00:07:21,926 --> 00:07:24,095
Could you turn
around, please?

72
00:07:24,137 --> 00:07:25,596
Thank you.

73
00:07:45,572 --> 00:07:46,991
Can you zip me up?

74
00:07:47,032 --> 00:07:48,284
Yeah.

75
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,168
Oh...

76
00:08:02,756 --> 00:08:05,759
it looks nice to me.

77
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,345
You want me to wear it?

78
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:09,847
Fuck, no.

79
00:08:09,888 --> 00:08:11,599
I want you to buy it.

80
00:08:15,283 --> 00:08:16,701
50 bucks.

81
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,457
It might be worth a suck.

82
00:08:25,084 --> 00:08:26,878
Is that what you're
getting for a suck...

83
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:28,963
these days, 50 bucks?

84
00:08:30,298 --> 00:08:32,008
Christ.

85
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:35,470
Where did you get
all these nice things?

86
00:08:37,305 --> 00:08:41,684
Oh, when I left my wife
I took 'em with me.

87
00:08:41,726 --> 00:08:44,729
Figured I paid for 'em,
they're my clothes, right?

88
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,487
You left your wife?

89
00:08:52,487 --> 00:08:54,822
How long you been
working for Pablo?

90
00:08:54,864 --> 00:08:56,824
Since the beginning
of the semester.

91
00:08:56,866 --> 00:08:58,493
I go to Miami-Dade.

92
00:08:58,534 --> 00:09:00,161
l...I'm majoring
in business...

93
00:09:00,203 --> 00:09:01,412
but I also take
English classes.

94
00:09:01,454 --> 00:09:02,497
Yeah, well...

95
00:09:02,538 --> 00:09:03,706
the first thing they
should have taught you...

96
00:09:03,748 --> 00:09:05,458
at your hooker classes...

97
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,210
is you shouldn't
ask the clients...

98
00:09:07,251 --> 00:09:09,170
so many fucking
personal questions.

99
00:09:13,369 --> 00:09:14,787
I'm sorry.

100
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,251
Are you going to call down
and cancel me now?

101
00:09:21,293 --> 00:09:23,837
That's OK.
Don't feel bad about it.

102
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:25,714
Um, I hope, uh...

103
00:09:25,756 --> 00:09:26,882
the next girl's
more to your liking...

104
00:09:26,924 --> 00:09:28,884
and I hope that you enjoy
your stay in Florida...

105
00:09:28,926 --> 00:09:30,052
Mr. Gotlieb.

106
00:09:30,094 --> 00:09:31,470
I'm giving you
your dress back.

107
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:35,307
No, forget
about the dress.

108
00:09:35,307 --> 00:09:36,308
Honey...

109
00:09:38,894 --> 00:09:40,854
did I upset you?

110
00:09:40,896 --> 00:09:42,314
I'm sorry.

111
00:09:43,607 --> 00:09:45,192
So you want me to stay?

112
00:09:51,723 --> 00:09:53,850
OK, then.

113
00:09:53,891 --> 00:09:54,892
Let's do it.

114
00:10:04,235 --> 00:10:06,154
Ready?

115
00:10:06,154 --> 00:10:07,947
Turn over.

116
00:10:40,647 --> 00:10:42,149
Is something wrong?

117
00:10:48,113 --> 00:10:49,948
I haven't been
with a woman...

118
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,366
in a long time.

119
00:11:01,466 --> 00:11:02,925
Wow.

120
00:11:12,977 --> 00:11:14,938
I'm sorry.

121
00:11:39,212 --> 00:11:41,547
Nobody kisses us.

122
00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:50,057
Pepper.

123
00:11:56,567 --> 00:11:57,943
OK, Henderson, what's up?

124
00:11:57,943 --> 00:11:59,779
These two Krishnas have
been working the airport...

125
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,113
for a couple of months.

126
00:12:01,113 --> 00:12:04,033
Now they'd been warned about
bugging the passengers.

127
00:12:04,075 --> 00:12:06,077
Should've listened.

128
00:12:07,453 --> 00:12:08,788
How was he killed?

129
00:12:08,788 --> 00:12:09,789
He fucked with some guy...

130
00:12:09,789 --> 00:12:11,123
wearing a suede
leather sport coat...

131
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:12,291
so the guy takes
his finger...

132
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:15,002
bends it back, breaks it,
then disappears.

133
00:12:15,044 --> 00:12:17,171
Now the witness lady says
she thinks that, uh...

134
00:12:17,213 --> 00:12:19,256
well, he hopped on one of
the hotel courtesy vans.

135
00:12:19,298 --> 00:12:20,466
We got a partial
description.

136
00:12:20,508 --> 00:12:21,884
Wait a minute.

137
00:12:21,926 --> 00:12:25,096
The Krishna died
of a broken finger?

138
00:12:25,137 --> 00:12:26,847
I mean, is that a homicide?

139
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:29,016
Well, I guess
he died of shock.

140
00:12:30,935 --> 00:12:32,228
Well, it hurts like hell...

141
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:34,522
to have your finger
bent back.

142
00:12:34,563 --> 00:12:36,482
My sister used to do it
to me when I was a kid.

143
00:12:36,482 --> 00:12:37,817
Yeah, but you didn't die.

144
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:40,403
Now, if this
was an accident...

145
00:12:40,444 --> 00:12:44,573
it would be
simple assault, right?

146
00:12:44,615 --> 00:12:48,911
However...if the guy
in the suede sport coat...

147
00:12:48,953 --> 00:12:52,415
knew that Krishnas
had a bad habit of dying...

148
00:12:52,456 --> 00:12:54,792
every time you bent
their finger back...

149
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,711
-Murder one?
-Yeah.

150
00:12:58,752 --> 00:13:00,379
Well, the guys
at the station...

151
00:13:00,421 --> 00:13:01,630
are going to laugh
their asses off...

152
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,801
Your turn to notify
next of kin.

153
00:13:05,843 --> 00:13:08,095
No way! I did the fat lady
that sat on a kid.

154
00:13:08,137 --> 00:13:09,221
That's good for 2.

155
00:13:10,598 --> 00:13:11,765
Next week?

156
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,851
I'll be retired by then.

157
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,060
Ah, shit.

158
00:13:18,814 --> 00:13:19,982
Well, you try the hotels.

159
00:13:20,024 --> 00:13:21,775
See if anyone got off
one of their courtesy vans...

160
00:13:21,817 --> 00:13:24,361
wearing a suede sport coat.

161
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:25,863
Ah, shit.

162
00:13:31,087 --> 00:13:33,089
This is good here.

163
00:14:51,167 --> 00:14:52,585
Oh, excuse me.

164
00:15:08,726 --> 00:15:09,894
Maybe we should try
in here.

165
00:15:09,935 --> 00:15:11,103
All right.

166
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,981
Price check.
Uzi squirt gun.

167
00:16:00,979 --> 00:16:02,981
Disregard.

168
00:16:15,619 --> 00:16:16,578
What's up?

169
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,580
Got something for me?

170
00:16:18,622 --> 00:16:19,539
I got the goods.

171
00:16:19,581 --> 00:16:20,981
Whoa!

172
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,335
In the bag. Now!

173
00:16:23,376 --> 00:16:24,586
Up against the wall. Now!

174
00:16:24,628 --> 00:16:26,129
Be cool, brother.

175
00:16:30,926 --> 00:16:32,427
Hey, he's got a gun!

176
00:16:32,469 --> 00:16:33,428
Let's get out of here!

177
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,471
Move it!

178
00:16:50,278 --> 00:16:53,448
Give me a day's notice
before it runs out, OK?

179
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,825
Wednesday.

180
00:16:55,867 --> 00:16:57,494
Tell me Tuesday.

181
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:08,755
Looky, we got
a million dollars.

182
00:17:08,797 --> 00:17:14,844
We got a million...
Brazilian dollars.

183
00:17:14,886 --> 00:17:16,596
Absolutely worthless.

184
00:17:18,139 --> 00:17:21,518
"That's a lot
of money, man.

185
00:17:19,751 --> 00:17:22,128
"That's a lot of
fucking money.

186
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:28,718
"I don't think you are
a Porsche customer...

187
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,219
"Mr. Frenger.

188
00:17:30,261 --> 00:17:34,223
"I don't think you really
want to buy a Porsche.

189
00:17:34,265 --> 00:17:36,309
Do you want to buy
a Porsche?"

190
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:40,062
No, man! I'm here
to waste my time.

191
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,274
How much for
the speedboat, man?

192
00:17:45,316 --> 00:17:49,778
"Oh, the speedboat is
very expensive, sir.

193
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,240
That speedboat is $50,000."

194
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:57,453
Wrap it up, man.

195
00:17:57,494 --> 00:17:58,912
Yeah. The bellman said...

196
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,414
some guy matching
the description...

197
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:03,000
got off a courtesy van.
Registered. Yeah.

198
00:18:03,042 --> 00:18:04,168
Got a name?

199
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:07,004
Name was, uh...
Herman Gotlieb.

200
00:18:07,046 --> 00:18:10,424
Yeah. I'm in the room
right now.

201
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:12,259
Coat's here, too.

202
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:14,261
Coat? What else?

203
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:15,763
Well, the bellman
also said...

204
00:18:15,763 --> 00:18:16,889
the guy had
a hooker with him.

205
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,140
-A hooker?
-Yeah.

206
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:19,391
No lie?

207
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:20,517
I got an address on her.

208
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,686
An address?

209
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:23,687
Oh, man.

210
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:26,732
Got a pen handy there,
Hoke?

211
00:18:26,774 --> 00:18:28,692
Give me the hooker's
address.

212
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:49,061
-Hi!
-Hey.

213
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:54,483
You showed up.

214
00:18:54,525 --> 00:18:55,484
I brought you
a present.

215
00:18:55,526 --> 00:18:59,280
Oh, really?
I got you one, too.

216
00:18:59,322 --> 00:19:01,115
A present from a client.

217
00:19:01,157 --> 00:19:05,119
Well, hey, I'm more
than a client.

218
00:19:05,161 --> 00:19:08,623
"Shit happens when
you party naked!"

219
00:19:08,664 --> 00:19:09,832
Look at us.

220
00:19:09,874 --> 00:19:11,751
I was just gonna get you
the plain "Shit happens..."

221
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:14,378
but I thought you'd like
the "party naked" part.

222
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,839
Hey, that's the best part.

223
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:22,220
Hi. Um, circe salad, Noira.
It's real good, Junior.

224
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:23,262
Two.

225
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:24,889
Right away.

226
00:19:25,673 --> 00:19:28,009
So, uh, Susie...

227
00:19:29,177 --> 00:19:31,471
tell me how you wound up
living in Miami.

228
00:19:31,512 --> 00:19:33,556
Oh, I got a job
at a Burger World...

229
00:19:33,598 --> 00:19:34,849
up in Hollywood...

230
00:19:34,891 --> 00:19:36,434
and I was gonna, you know...

231
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:38,061
save up and get
my own franchise...

232
00:19:38,102 --> 00:19:41,606
but Pablo offered me
this job.

233
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:44,651
Well, it pays
a whole lot better.

234
00:19:44,692 --> 00:19:46,569
This is a nice cup, Junior.

235
00:19:46,611 --> 00:19:48,571
I'm gonna get a lot
of use out of this.

236
00:19:48,613 --> 00:19:50,615
It's a good cup.

237
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:52,659
Hey, did you see
the swimmers?

238
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,494
That's why
I picked this place.

239
00:19:54,535 --> 00:19:56,579
They do, like,
a water ballet.

240
00:19:56,621 --> 00:19:59,165
Ballet in the water.
I like it.

241
00:19:59,207 --> 00:20:00,333
'Cause I like
to swim myself.

242
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,043
I'd rather do that kind
of work, you know?

243
00:20:02,085 --> 00:20:03,586
But you gotta train
for a long time.

244
00:20:03,628 --> 00:20:06,547
So now I want to take
a Spanish course in college.

245
00:20:06,589 --> 00:20:07,757
You know, in my business...

246
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,217
a lot of people don't
speak English...

247
00:20:09,217 --> 00:20:10,593
so I think I'd
be better at it...

248
00:20:10,635 --> 00:20:11,594
if I spoke...thank you.

249
00:20:11,636 --> 00:20:13,262
We'll take
the check now.

250
00:20:13,304 --> 00:20:14,263
Yes, sir.

251
00:20:14,305 --> 00:20:16,140
You know, like,
well, Cuban, also.

252
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:18,184
And I think that's sort
of like Spanish...Cuban...

253
00:20:18,226 --> 00:20:19,769
but it's
a little different.

254
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:27,777
This ice cream dressing
is sour as shit.

255
00:20:27,448 --> 00:20:29,002
It's yogurt dressing,
not ice cream.

256
00:20:30,612 --> 00:20:31,905
Where you been?

257
00:20:31,946 --> 00:20:34,866
Oh, that's OK.

258
00:20:34,908 --> 00:20:35,867
I never had
yogurt dressing...

259
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:38,286
up in Okeechobee.

260
00:20:38,328 --> 00:20:39,287
Where is that?

261
00:20:39,329 --> 00:20:41,206
That's where I'm from.

262
00:20:41,247 --> 00:20:43,083
You heard
of Lake Okeechobee.

263
00:20:43,124 --> 00:20:44,417
I'm from California.

264
00:20:44,459 --> 00:20:46,711
I don't know shit
about Florida.

265
00:20:46,753 --> 00:20:48,463
You ever heard
of Lake Tahoe?

266
00:20:48,505 --> 00:20:50,006
Lake Tahoe?

267
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:51,382
How is it?

268
00:20:51,804 --> 00:20:52,805
Lousy.

269
00:20:54,849 --> 00:20:56,058
Who is he?

270
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,476
We're engaged.

271
00:20:57,518 --> 00:20:59,061
Hey, separate checks.

272
00:20:59,103 --> 00:21:00,980
My treat.

273
00:21:01,021 --> 00:21:02,189
Good luck.

274
00:21:02,231 --> 00:21:03,441
Hey, Susie...

275
00:21:03,482 --> 00:21:06,861
we're not gonna be
calling it a night, are we?

276
00:21:06,902 --> 00:21:08,070
I got a homework paper.

277
00:21:08,112 --> 00:21:09,738
I gotta write a haiku
for English class.

278
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,782
I tell you what.

279
00:21:11,782 --> 00:21:13,409
I'm real good
at making up things...

280
00:21:13,451 --> 00:21:15,578
you know, poems.
I could come over.

281
00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:17,079
I could help you
write your, uh...

282
00:21:17,121 --> 00:21:18,414
Haiku?

283
00:21:18,456 --> 00:21:19,915
Definitely.

284
00:21:21,538 --> 00:21:23,415
Let's get out of here.

285
00:21:29,796 --> 00:21:32,799
Thank you. I'm sorry.
I liked the food.

286
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:33,800
Bye.

287
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:36,946
So you think this
unidentified assailant...

288
00:21:36,946 --> 00:21:38,405
who broke, uh...

289
00:21:40,908 --> 00:21:44,453
Ravindra's finger
did it on purpose?

290
00:21:50,459 --> 00:21:53,504
Sorry, uh...Ramba.

291
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:55,923
That's all right. Heh.

292
00:22:24,868 --> 00:22:27,496
That was a short engagement.

293
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:50,918
Hey, you know,
you still haven't told me...

294
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:53,086
what it is you do.

295
00:22:53,128 --> 00:22:55,213
Oh, I got investments.

296
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:00,761
I take people's money
and put it to work.

297
00:23:00,802 --> 00:23:02,429
You got any?

298
00:23:06,767 --> 00:23:09,353
I got a $10,000 CD...

299
00:23:09,394 --> 00:23:11,355
and I take
the interest from that...

300
00:23:11,396 --> 00:23:13,440
and I put it
into a N.O.W. account.

301
00:23:14,775 --> 00:23:16,818
Jesus Christ.

302
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,446
That's the biggest
frigging racket going.

303
00:23:19,488 --> 00:23:21,448
I want you
to march straight down...

304
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:23,367
to the bank first thing
in the morning...

305
00:23:23,367 --> 00:23:25,244
and cash in both
of those things.

306
00:23:25,285 --> 00:23:28,330
I can't let my fiancee
get ripped-off...

307
00:23:28,372 --> 00:23:30,749
when I can
double your money.

308
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:33,710
-Double?
-Yeah.

309
00:23:40,566 --> 00:23:43,193
How 'bout that poem
we were gonna write?

310
00:23:51,477 --> 00:23:54,522
We make love a lot.

311
00:23:56,524 --> 00:23:59,944
We make love right now.

312
00:23:59,986 --> 00:24:02,447
No. It's seven
in the second line.

313
00:24:04,657 --> 00:24:06,409
Seven in the second line?

314
00:24:10,788 --> 00:24:14,709
Splashes around
in his pond...

315
00:24:14,751 --> 00:24:17,170
Could you
close the door, please?

316
00:24:29,307 --> 00:24:31,726
Thinking he's...

317
00:24:38,433 --> 00:24:40,184
alone.

318
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:51,491
Breaking, entering...

319
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:57,122
the dark
and Ionely place...places.

320
00:25:04,254 --> 00:25:10,427
Finding a...big gun.

321
00:25:16,701 --> 00:25:18,578
Smelling like a rose.

322
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,818
Any luck?

323
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,611
I wrote 2. Heh.

324
00:25:42,653 --> 00:25:44,864
Maybe I'll get extra credit.

325
00:25:44,905 --> 00:25:47,241
Hey, where did you
get these?

326
00:25:47,283 --> 00:25:48,325
Dumb question.

327
00:25:48,367 --> 00:25:51,871
-Are you a nosy rosy?
-Mm-mmm.

328
00:25:51,912 --> 00:25:54,373
What the hell
was that, man?

329
00:25:54,415 --> 00:25:56,417
The doorbell.

330
00:25:56,458 --> 00:25:59,170
Talk about dumb questions.

331
00:26:01,947 --> 00:26:04,241
Susan Waggoner?

332
00:26:04,283 --> 00:26:05,284
Can I come in?

333
00:26:08,454 --> 00:26:10,456
I bet you're
Herman Gotlieb.

334
00:26:11,874 --> 00:26:12,833
How much?

335
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,128
Sergeant Hoke Moseley.

336
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,379
Homicide.

337
00:26:17,421 --> 00:26:18,923
Herman Gotlieb.

338
00:26:18,964 --> 00:26:21,550
I'd like to ask you
a few questions. Routine.

339
00:26:21,592 --> 00:26:23,803
Boy, you got
a grip there, Herman.

340
00:26:23,844 --> 00:26:25,971
Been working out?

341
00:26:26,013 --> 00:26:28,391
Can I get you
a cold one there, Sarge?

342
00:26:28,391 --> 00:26:30,267
Well, why not?

343
00:26:31,936 --> 00:26:33,687
Two Polars, honey.

344
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:40,565
You down at the airport
today, Herman?

345
00:26:40,606 --> 00:26:43,067
Yeah, I was.

346
00:26:43,067 --> 00:26:45,027
Somebody broke
the finger off

347
00:26:45,069 --> 00:26:46,028
a Hare Krishna...

348
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:48,197
and the son
of a bitch died.

349
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,949
No shit?

350
00:26:49,991 --> 00:26:51,993
No shit.

351
00:26:54,921 --> 00:26:56,590
I didn't do it.

352
00:26:56,632 --> 00:26:58,175
Oh, no, no, no.

353
00:26:58,216 --> 00:26:59,176
We're just looking
for someone...

354
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:01,094
who might have seen
anything.

355
00:27:01,136 --> 00:27:03,221
I'm curious, uh...

356
00:27:03,263 --> 00:27:05,015
you own
a suede sport coat?

357
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:07,517
Yeah, I do.

358
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,728
OK. You're probably
the one.

359
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,188
Did you get on
the courtesy van...

360
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:12,439
to the Grand Prix Hotel?

361
00:27:12,481 --> 00:27:16,318
Hey, fuck
this nonsense, man.

362
00:27:16,318 --> 00:27:18,362
You're misunderstanding
this, Herman.

363
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:18,819
Who got killed?

364
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,704
You know, if I had
something better to do...

365
00:27:20,746 --> 00:27:22,248
like sit at home
with a beautiful girl...

366
00:27:22,248 --> 00:27:24,500
I wouldn't even be
bothering you, but, uh...

367
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:27,044
you were mentioned
as a possible witness.

368
00:27:27,086 --> 00:27:29,213
See anything?

369
00:27:45,312 --> 00:27:46,647
We got this
forensic dentist.

370
00:27:46,689 --> 00:27:48,899
And l, uh, I talked him
into pulling my teeth...

371
00:27:48,941 --> 00:27:50,860
and fixing me
some new chompers.

372
00:27:50,901 --> 00:27:52,862
Well, it took two months
of his spare time.

373
00:27:52,903 --> 00:27:54,196
And I got so used to
drinking without 'em...

374
00:27:54,238 --> 00:27:55,406
I just pull 'em out.

375
00:27:56,782 --> 00:27:57,266
Bother you?

376
00:27:57,796 --> 00:27:58,964
Junior...

377
00:28:00,674 --> 00:28:02,593
you want me to fix
those pork chops now?

378
00:28:06,388 --> 00:28:08,349
Hell, I'll put 'em
back in for pork chops.

379
00:28:09,558 --> 00:28:12,102
Pork chops comin' up.

380
00:28:16,788 --> 00:28:18,373
Herman...

381
00:28:18,414 --> 00:28:21,251
your fiancee...

382
00:28:21,292 --> 00:28:24,336
is the best cook
in South Florida.

383
00:28:24,337 --> 00:28:25,333
More taters?

384
00:28:31,464 --> 00:28:32,507
Junior?

385
00:28:41,474 --> 00:28:44,685
So, Herman, where
did you do your time?

386
00:28:47,522 --> 00:28:49,148
Time?

387
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:51,442
What do you mean?

388
00:28:51,484 --> 00:28:54,195
Well, the way you're
guarding that food.

389
00:28:54,237 --> 00:28:55,571
You know...

390
00:28:55,571 --> 00:28:58,282
like another con could
take it away from you.

391
00:28:59,951 --> 00:29:03,746
Well, I was raised
in foster homes, you know?

392
00:29:03,788 --> 00:29:06,833
I didn't get no dessert
till I was in eighth grade.

393
00:29:08,292 --> 00:29:09,335
Damn.

394
00:29:09,377 --> 00:29:12,255
I got a daughter
in the eighth grade.

395
00:29:12,296 --> 00:29:15,883
Half my paycheck goes
to her orthodontist.

396
00:29:15,925 --> 00:29:18,177
She's got your teeth, man.

397
00:29:26,269 --> 00:29:28,354
Yeah. The joint's
about the only place...

398
00:29:28,396 --> 00:29:30,565
you got time to work out
to get a grip like that.

399
00:29:36,048 --> 00:29:38,676
I was an aerobics
instructor.

400
00:29:38,717 --> 00:29:41,845
Shoots the shit
out of that theory.

401
00:29:51,146 --> 00:29:52,773
Any more Polars?

402
00:29:52,815 --> 00:29:54,775
Oh...

403
00:29:54,817 --> 00:29:56,151
Junior got
the last one.

404
00:29:56,151 --> 00:29:57,987
I could run out
and get some.

405
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:03,367
Beer's gone, I'm gone.

406
00:30:03,409 --> 00:30:05,411
You're kidding.

407
00:30:07,632 --> 00:30:08,758
But, you know,
I gotta get...

408
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,344
that pork chop
recipe first.

409
00:30:11,386 --> 00:30:14,180
No. Are you serious?

410
00:30:14,222 --> 00:30:16,683
It's so easy, what I did.

411
00:30:16,724 --> 00:30:17,934
You are definitely
not gonna have...

412
00:30:17,976 --> 00:30:19,060
to write this down.

413
00:30:19,102 --> 00:30:22,480
All it is is pork chops
in a frying pan.

414
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,773
And just cook 'em
in their own fat...

415
00:30:23,815 --> 00:30:24,774
with a lot of salt.

416
00:30:24,816 --> 00:30:25,984
Oh, well,
they sure were good...

417
00:30:26,025 --> 00:30:28,570
but you know
what I really like...

418
00:30:28,611 --> 00:30:31,406
is native Florida cooking.

419
00:30:31,448 --> 00:30:32,949
Now, did you ever have
chestnut batter...

420
00:30:32,991 --> 00:30:34,075
on your pork chops?

421
00:30:34,117 --> 00:30:35,410
Boy, I never did.

422
00:30:35,452 --> 00:30:37,746
You got a recipe
for that somewhere?

423
00:30:37,787 --> 00:30:39,372
Uh, yeah, I do,
as a matter of fact.

424
00:30:39,414 --> 00:30:41,207
I'll give it to you.
Just a minute here.

425
00:30:41,249 --> 00:30:43,168
Oh, I appreciate that.

426
00:30:43,168 --> 00:30:44,669
Great dinner.

427
00:30:45,613 --> 00:30:48,908
Get you something
to go, Sarge?

428
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,534
Just you.

429
00:30:50,576 --> 00:30:53,371
Kidding, Herman.

430
00:30:53,412 --> 00:30:55,331
Listen, if you
think of anything...

431
00:30:55,331 --> 00:30:57,083
just, uh, give me a call.

432
00:30:57,124 --> 00:31:00,628
That's my home phone.

433
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:01,796
Look, it's a hotel...

434
00:31:01,837 --> 00:31:03,214
and the old guy
at the desk is deaf...

435
00:31:03,256 --> 00:31:06,217
so, uh, just let it ring
till he sees the lights.

436
00:31:06,259 --> 00:31:08,970
Oh, and, uh,
when we round up...

437
00:31:09,011 --> 00:31:10,596
the usual airport
hoodlums...

438
00:31:10,638 --> 00:31:14,308
maybe you could shoot by and
take a look at a line-up.

439
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,977
Take you five minutes.

440
00:31:16,937 --> 00:31:19,690
Oh, yeah.

441
00:31:19,731 --> 00:31:21,608
You mind standing
in the line-up, too?

442
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:24,069
We're a little short
of bodies. Heh heh.

443
00:31:24,111 --> 00:31:26,363
You ever stood
in a line-up before, Herman?

444
00:31:29,074 --> 00:31:30,659
Never been caught, Sarge.

445
00:31:33,453 --> 00:31:35,914
Ah, you ain't got
one beer rat-holed...

446
00:31:35,956 --> 00:31:37,624
I can take with me
for the road, do you?

447
00:31:37,666 --> 00:31:40,878
You got it all, man.
Dog biscuits, too.

448
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:42,838
Oh...see you.

449
00:31:44,921 --> 00:31:46,923
Night, Susie.

450
00:32:54,115 --> 00:32:58,203
Years ago, I started
preaching catch-and-release.

451
00:32:58,244 --> 00:33:00,455
Back then, a lot of things
seemed to indicate...

452
00:33:00,497 --> 00:33:03,041
that our bass resource in
many areas of the country...

453
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:05,085
was rapidly diminishing.

454
00:33:05,126 --> 00:33:07,629
Today, there is
no doubt about it...

455
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:10,006
and I'm very concerned about
what the future holds...

456
00:33:10,048 --> 00:33:11,800
for this great sport.

457
00:33:11,841 --> 00:33:12,884
In simple terms...

458
00:33:12,926 --> 00:33:15,845
we don't have the vast
water we once had...

459
00:33:15,887 --> 00:33:17,347
and there are
several reasons for it...

460
00:33:17,388 --> 00:33:19,349
pollution,
illegal netting...

461
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:21,810
the pressure of removing
too many adult bass...

462
00:33:21,851 --> 00:33:23,311
from their environment.

463
00:33:23,353 --> 00:33:25,146
You know, they're kind of
like money in the bank.

464
00:33:30,137 --> 00:33:32,306
I got news for you.

465
00:33:32,347 --> 00:33:35,267
I'm not coming back.
I'm married.

466
00:33:35,309 --> 00:33:36,935
I am so married.

467
00:33:36,977 --> 00:33:38,687
I gotta go. Bye.

468
00:33:39,863 --> 00:33:40,947
You like ham and eggs?

469
00:33:44,284 --> 00:33:46,161
Drop it.

470
00:33:48,789 --> 00:33:50,499
It smells good.

471
00:33:52,084 --> 00:33:53,752
Who was that, anyway?

472
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,962
Pablo.

473
00:33:56,004 --> 00:33:58,215
The cops rousted him.

474
00:33:58,256 --> 00:34:00,675
I guess they're giving him
a hard time because of you.

475
00:34:11,747 --> 00:34:13,749
We got to go for
a little ride, honey.

476
00:34:13,791 --> 00:34:15,126
What?

477
00:34:15,167 --> 00:34:16,210
What about breakfast?

478
00:34:16,252 --> 00:34:17,586
It was gonna be a surprise.

479
00:34:17,628 --> 00:34:19,380
I was gonna bring it
in to you on a tray.

480
00:34:19,422 --> 00:34:20,423
And then l...

481
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,009
Make it to go.

482
00:36:15,421 --> 00:36:17,798
Not too tired
for some fun?

483
00:36:25,431 --> 00:36:27,349
Call it a night, sister.

484
00:36:27,391 --> 00:36:29,268
Aye, aye, sir.

485
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:18,041
I got something that
I gotta tell you.

486
00:37:19,376 --> 00:37:21,211
I used to be in prison.

487
00:37:21,252 --> 00:37:23,838
What did you do
to get there?

488
00:37:27,092 --> 00:37:30,095
I used to rob people
who robbed people.

489
00:37:31,888 --> 00:37:33,848
Kind of like Robin Hood?

490
00:37:37,435 --> 00:37:38,853
Except I didn't
give the money...

491
00:37:38,895 --> 00:37:40,313
to the poor people.

492
00:37:43,149 --> 00:37:45,777
You don't do that
anymore, do you?

493
00:37:47,888 --> 00:37:50,140
I got investments now.

494
00:37:50,182 --> 00:37:53,769
Good. You got me
out of the life.

495
00:37:53,811 --> 00:37:54,761
Now you stay out of crime.

496
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:57,393
Sounds good.

497
00:37:57,435 --> 00:37:58,436
Promise?

498
00:38:00,897 --> 00:38:02,774
Yeah, sure.
Why not?

499
00:38:02,815 --> 00:38:05,360
Say you promise.

500
00:38:17,187 --> 00:38:18,897
I promise.

501
00:38:21,024 --> 00:38:22,192
Henderson?

502
00:38:22,234 --> 00:38:25,028
Sanchez. Homicide.

503
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,655
Oh, my replacement.

504
00:38:26,697 --> 00:38:27,656
How is he?

505
00:38:27,698 --> 00:38:29,658
He's got a cervical
disc injury...

506
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,785
a dislocated jaw, bruises...

507
00:38:31,827 --> 00:38:36,039
uh, got a concussion...
I don't know how bad it is.

508
00:38:36,081 --> 00:38:38,041
Somebody really
worked him over.

509
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:39,418
Did he tell you
who did it?

510
00:38:39,418 --> 00:38:41,044
What happened?

511
00:38:41,086 --> 00:38:43,296
No. He's in and out
of consciousness.

512
00:38:57,017 --> 00:38:58,935
Drop the knife, Pablo.

513
00:38:58,977 --> 00:39:01,229
My name isn't Gotlieb.

514
00:39:01,271 --> 00:39:03,815
Sergeant Hoke Moseley,
homicide.

515
00:39:03,857 --> 00:39:05,859
That little girl
you sent up to my room?

516
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,652
She's 15 years old, man.

517
00:39:07,694 --> 00:39:11,156
She's 23, man.
She's not 15.

518
00:39:11,197 --> 00:39:14,659
Look. Sergeant Lackley
checked her I.D.

519
00:39:14,701 --> 00:39:17,370
Why don't you call him?
I pay him every week.

520
00:39:17,412 --> 00:39:19,247
Maybe you two guys
can get together.

521
00:39:19,247 --> 00:39:21,041
How much you pay
Lackley every week?

522
00:39:21,082 --> 00:39:22,667
$500 a week. Don't.

523
00:39:22,709 --> 00:39:24,502
All right, from now on,
Lackley gets 250.

524
00:39:24,544 --> 00:39:26,171
The other 250 to me...

525
00:39:26,212 --> 00:39:27,797
at the Primrose Hotel.
You got it, man?

526
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:31,051
Lackley's not gonna go
for any split like that.

527
00:39:31,092 --> 00:39:32,927
You tell the guy
at the desk...

528
00:39:32,927 --> 00:39:35,138
to leave it for me
in the safe.

529
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:54,750
Hi. What can I get for you?

530
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:56,127
Uh...iced coffee.

531
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:02,550
Hey! What are you doing?

532
00:40:03,884 --> 00:40:04,844
Open!

533
00:40:04,885 --> 00:40:07,930
Open the goddamn
drawer now! Do it!

534
00:40:10,224 --> 00:40:11,350
Stop or I'll shoot!

535
00:40:13,269 --> 00:40:14,728
You just shot me.

536
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:16,939
I fired a warning shot
and it hit you.

537
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:18,107
You're no cop.

538
00:40:19,775 --> 00:40:21,318
No problem.

539
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,862
There is no problem.

540
00:40:22,903 --> 00:40:24,280
Police. Homicide.

541
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:25,489
You people go about
your business.

542
00:40:25,531 --> 00:40:28,325
You finish your lunches,
your breakfasts, whatever.

543
00:40:28,367 --> 00:40:29,326
Don't worry, lady.

544
00:40:29,368 --> 00:40:30,786
I'm gonna call
an ambulance now...

545
00:40:30,786 --> 00:40:34,248
on the radio
in my police car.

546
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:35,916
Yeah. I'll be right back.

547
00:40:40,673 --> 00:40:42,133
Slow down.

548
00:40:46,094 --> 00:40:47,095
Go ahead.

549
00:40:53,769 --> 00:40:55,729
Stop right here!

550
00:41:13,683 --> 00:41:14,725
Furnished?

551
00:41:14,767 --> 00:41:16,936
Yeah, with almost antiques.

552
00:41:26,394 --> 00:41:27,895
How much?

553
00:41:39,587 --> 00:41:41,297
I been worried sick!

554
00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:43,299
Where you been all day?

555
00:41:43,341 --> 00:41:44,925
Dumb question.

556
00:41:46,861 --> 00:41:49,530
Did you get the money?

557
00:41:49,572 --> 00:41:52,033
I cashed in
the $10,000 CD...

558
00:41:52,075 --> 00:41:53,868
but I decided to keep
the N.O.W. account open...

559
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:54,911
for 8 more days.

560
00:41:56,955 --> 00:41:59,624
What did I tell you?

561
00:41:59,666 --> 00:42:00,667
Huh?

562
00:42:02,126 --> 00:42:04,545
They said if I keep it
open for 8 more days...

563
00:42:04,545 --> 00:42:06,464
I'll be eligible
for a teapot.

564
00:42:13,676 --> 00:42:15,010
I'm sorry.

565
00:42:17,638 --> 00:42:20,057
It's just 8 more days.

566
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:21,267
You'll still be here,
won't you?

567
00:42:21,308 --> 00:42:23,144
I don't know.

568
00:42:25,312 --> 00:42:26,939
My problem is
that I can have...

569
00:42:26,981 --> 00:42:28,482
everything and anything
that I want...

570
00:42:28,524 --> 00:42:30,442
but I don't know
what I want.

571
00:42:35,156 --> 00:42:36,377
Tell me again about that
Burger World franchise.

572
00:42:46,222 --> 00:42:48,099
OK.

573
00:42:48,141 --> 00:42:50,101
You need $50,000.

574
00:42:50,143 --> 00:42:51,811
You borrow another 50,000
from Burger World...

575
00:42:51,853 --> 00:42:53,479
and you wait for an opening.

576
00:42:54,731 --> 00:42:56,733
But why?
What's the purpose?

577
00:43:00,695 --> 00:43:03,156
To make a living,
that's all.

578
00:43:03,156 --> 00:43:05,867
You hire kids, so you
can pay 'em nothing.

579
00:43:05,908 --> 00:43:06,868
And you watch 'em
real close...

580
00:43:06,909 --> 00:43:08,411
or they will
steal you blind.

581
00:43:08,453 --> 00:43:09,996
And...and you save
your money...

582
00:43:10,038 --> 00:43:13,791
and you buy
a nice little house...

583
00:43:13,833 --> 00:43:16,085
with a white picket fence.

584
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:21,758
And you live
happily ever after.

585
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:26,304
I tell you what.
Let's go straight...

586
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:30,429
I can't see any point...

587
00:43:30,471 --> 00:43:31,972
in hanging out
at a Burger World...

588
00:43:32,014 --> 00:43:32,810
no matter how much money
you're gonna make.

589
00:43:35,056 --> 00:43:36,766
It's stupid.

590
00:43:36,808 --> 00:43:39,769
You can forget about
Burger World, honey.

591
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:54,389
I'm gonna
take care of you...

592
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:56,016
and you're gonna
take care of me.

593
00:43:56,058 --> 00:43:58,727
That's our purpose.

594
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:01,688
Do you know any
married people today?

595
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:04,233
Hmm? They're a team.

596
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:08,195
They pull together,
and they get rich.

597
00:44:08,237 --> 00:44:10,781
They got it all.

598
00:44:14,769 --> 00:44:15,728
And you know
that little house...

599
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:17,480
you were just
talking about?

600
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:22,235
I rented us one
in Coral Gables today.

601
00:44:22,276 --> 00:44:24,403
Oh, Junior.

602
00:44:24,445 --> 00:44:26,781
That's what you were
up to all day?

603
00:44:29,408 --> 00:44:33,412
I'm gonna take
such good care of you.

604
00:44:33,454 --> 00:44:34,497
Mm-hmm.

605
00:44:37,678 --> 00:44:41,473
He was a big guy, man.
Bigger than you.

606
00:44:41,515 --> 00:44:43,892
Got up from the table,
said he was homicide.

607
00:44:43,934 --> 00:44:45,644
Pulled a badge?

608
00:44:45,686 --> 00:44:47,646
After he whacks the dude.

609
00:44:47,688 --> 00:44:51,317
It was cold, man, ice cold.

610
00:44:54,153 --> 00:44:56,113
Thanks, Blink.

611
00:44:56,155 --> 00:44:58,198
What do I owe you?

612
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,076
It's on the house, bro.

613
00:45:47,998 --> 00:45:48,999
Come on.

614
00:46:31,208 --> 00:46:34,002
I like the air conditioning
on frozen.

615
00:46:34,044 --> 00:46:35,671
Me, too.

616
00:46:52,413 --> 00:46:54,040
1/2 ounce.
Primo, man.

617
00:46:54,082 --> 00:46:55,083
Thanks, man.

618
00:47:09,331 --> 00:47:11,166
Hey, half that's mine.

619
00:47:11,207 --> 00:47:13,043
Fuck you! I sold it.
I keep the money.

620
00:47:13,084 --> 00:47:14,794
These are my contacts.
They're my people.

621
00:47:14,836 --> 00:47:15,442
I don't give a shit
about your contacts.

622
00:47:17,923 --> 00:47:18,722
Police! Freeze!

623
00:47:18,723 --> 00:47:20,363
Stand over there.

624
00:47:20,405 --> 00:47:23,158
Put that on.
Right through there.

625
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:27,871
You know what to do,
Shorty.

626
00:47:27,871 --> 00:47:29,831
Hey!

627
00:47:29,873 --> 00:47:31,291
I don't believe this.

628
00:47:39,216 --> 00:47:42,344
I'm gonna let
you two guys go...

629
00:47:42,385 --> 00:47:44,346
with a little warning.

630
00:47:46,348 --> 00:47:47,724
Don't get caught.

631
00:47:47,766 --> 00:47:48,934
Shit!

632
00:47:52,938 --> 00:47:54,856
Police! Don't move!

633
00:48:03,615 --> 00:48:05,867
You can go now.

634
00:48:16,962 --> 00:48:18,880
Give me your wallet!

635
00:48:20,632 --> 00:48:23,009
Come on, man.
Move it...

636
00:48:23,051 --> 00:48:25,679
Police! Drop it!

637
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:27,347
I said drop it.

638
00:48:29,724 --> 00:48:31,685
Shoot him!

639
00:48:33,144 --> 00:48:34,145
Make it, Julio.

640
00:48:34,187 --> 00:48:35,146
Comprendo?

641
00:48:35,188 --> 00:48:36,398
Yeah. Yeah.

642
00:48:44,281 --> 00:48:45,657
That's my purse!

643
00:48:45,699 --> 00:48:47,784
Stop him!

644
00:48:47,826 --> 00:48:50,161
Stop! Somebody
please help me!

645
00:48:51,788 --> 00:48:53,582
Go get him.

646
00:48:56,793 --> 00:48:58,044
Thank you, officer.

647
00:48:58,086 --> 00:48:59,421
Yeah, that's great, lady.

648
00:48:59,462 --> 00:49:01,381
But...you're a cop!

649
00:49:01,423 --> 00:49:05,760
Hey! Police! Police!

650
00:49:05,802 --> 00:49:07,596
You have anything
against broccoli...

651
00:49:07,637 --> 00:49:10,015
cauliflower,
stuff like that?

652
00:49:13,723 --> 00:49:15,767
I don't want to talk
about that at this time.

653
00:49:17,685 --> 00:49:18,770
Oh.

654
00:49:18,811 --> 00:49:22,482
What are you going to do
now that we're married?

655
00:49:22,523 --> 00:49:26,611
Take care of the house,
shop, fix dinner.

656
00:49:30,073 --> 00:49:32,075
Take care of the babies.

657
00:49:33,576 --> 00:49:35,453
Is that what
you'd like to do?

658
00:49:35,495 --> 00:49:37,497
Be a mother?

659
00:49:38,748 --> 00:49:40,249
Well, I don't...

660
00:49:41,876 --> 00:49:42,835
I guess so.

661
00:49:42,919 --> 00:49:45,546
l...I don't...
I don't know.

662
00:49:47,090 --> 00:49:47,944
I lived with a girl
once for 2 months.

663
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:49,486
She didn't do anything...

664
00:49:50,515 --> 00:49:50,859
a housewife was
supposed to do.

665
00:49:51,945 --> 00:49:52,448
I thought you said
you were married.

666
00:49:54,728 --> 00:49:57,063
I told you that before
I really knew you.

667
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:01,067
What I'm driving at,
Susie, is...

668
00:50:01,109 --> 00:50:03,528
I want to have
a regular life.

669
00:50:04,779 --> 00:50:06,823
I want to go to work
in the morning...

670
00:50:06,865 --> 00:50:09,034
sometimes at night...

671
00:50:09,075 --> 00:50:10,577
come home
to a clean house...

672
00:50:10,619 --> 00:50:11,828
and a hot meal...

673
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:13,872
and a loving wife
just like you.

674
00:50:18,793 --> 00:50:21,129
I don't want to have
any babies.

675
00:50:22,256 --> 00:50:24,341
This world's a shit hole.

676
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,804
You think
you can handle that?

677
00:50:31,474 --> 00:50:33,476
I do.

678
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:38,272
I do.

679
00:51:13,169 --> 00:51:15,588
This is better
than counting money.

680
00:51:44,417 --> 00:51:46,378
These yours?

681
00:51:46,419 --> 00:51:48,171
I can't tell.

682
00:51:51,925 --> 00:51:54,886
Yeah. This, uh...
nail polish.

683
00:51:54,928 --> 00:51:58,890
We found two muscleheads
cuffed together.

684
00:51:58,932 --> 00:52:01,059
Jesus!
He's making arrests?

685
00:52:01,101 --> 00:52:02,811
We did some
routine prints.

686
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:04,229
They match those taken...

687
00:52:04,271 --> 00:52:06,815
from the scene of
the dumbbell murders.

688
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:10,569
I've been working
that case for 15 months.

689
00:52:12,849 --> 00:52:14,518
Find Gotlieb?

690
00:52:15,769 --> 00:52:17,062
We're looking for him.

691
00:52:17,103 --> 00:52:20,649
Ohh...let's get
the fuck out of here.

692
00:52:21,691 --> 00:52:22,776
I'll find him.

693
00:52:22,818 --> 00:52:24,236
Maybe you should wait
and let him solve...

694
00:52:24,277 --> 00:52:26,530
a couple more from
your case load, huh?

695
00:52:28,615 --> 00:52:30,742
Will you have
a seat, please?

696
00:52:30,784 --> 00:52:31,785
Where, here?

697
00:52:32,953 --> 00:52:33,995
Your name, please?

698
00:52:34,037 --> 00:52:35,997
Ziffel. Fred Ziffel.

699
00:52:36,039 --> 00:52:37,749
Is that the way you want
the account to read?

700
00:52:37,791 --> 00:52:39,376
No. I want it to read
"Arnold Ziffel."

701
00:52:39,417 --> 00:52:40,669
Here you go.

702
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:41,878
Thanks.

703
00:52:43,681 --> 00:52:44,640
Hey, Eddie.

704
00:52:44,682 --> 00:52:46,642
Here's the key
to your new suite.

705
00:52:46,684 --> 00:52:49,603
Oh, and some Cuban kid
on a bicycle...

706
00:52:49,603 --> 00:52:51,355
made two deliveries.

707
00:52:53,374 --> 00:52:55,668
Uh, 250 in both.

708
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:57,504
I'm sorry.
I opened them.

709
00:52:57,545 --> 00:53:00,465
It's OK, Eddie.

710
00:53:01,549 --> 00:53:02,759
Thanks.

711
00:53:02,801 --> 00:53:04,719
Uh-huh.

712
00:53:22,764 --> 00:53:23,932
Who is it?

713
00:53:23,973 --> 00:53:27,060
Lackley. Vice.

714
00:53:27,101 --> 00:53:29,270
Slide your I.D.
under the door.

715
00:53:29,312 --> 00:53:31,022
Are you fucking serious?

716
00:53:31,064 --> 00:53:32,649
Try me!
Next thing you hear...

717
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:34,692
will be a bullet
coming through the door!

718
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:01,069
Pablo sent this.

719
00:54:01,111 --> 00:54:02,237
What?

720
00:54:02,279 --> 00:54:05,657
What's the matter, Sarge?
Got a guilty conscience?

721
00:54:05,699 --> 00:54:08,702
I just got out
of the hospital.

722
00:54:08,744 --> 00:54:12,205
I know all about you.

723
00:54:12,247 --> 00:54:14,958
I like your place here,
too. It's very nice.

724
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,293
You also got
a little something...

725
00:54:16,335 --> 00:54:18,462
that belongs to me,
don't you, Gums?

726
00:54:18,503 --> 00:54:20,297
What the fuck
you talkin' about?

727
00:54:20,339 --> 00:54:21,757
I never seen you
before in my life.

728
00:54:21,798 --> 00:54:23,467
Now, listen, Sarge...

729
00:54:23,508 --> 00:54:26,011
you think you're moving in
on my territory?

730
00:54:26,011 --> 00:54:27,095
I think you better
cough up...

731
00:54:27,137 --> 00:54:28,305
some "do-re-mi" right now.

732
00:54:28,347 --> 00:54:30,349
500 bucks. Let's have it.

733
00:54:30,349 --> 00:54:32,643
What 500 bucks?

734
00:54:32,684 --> 00:54:34,061
What are you
talking about?

735
00:54:34,102 --> 00:54:35,062
-Fuck off!
-Fuck off?!

736
00:54:35,103 --> 00:54:37,230
You go to Pablo...

737
00:54:37,272 --> 00:54:38,941
you cut yourself in
on my action.

738
00:54:38,982 --> 00:54:40,817
You don't think
I'm coming after you?

739
00:54:40,859 --> 00:54:44,279
Jesus Christ!
You got a lot of balls!

740
00:54:47,634 --> 00:54:50,095
And Pablo wants the hooker
back on the job...

741
00:54:50,136 --> 00:54:52,681
tomorrow at 10:00,
and all is forgiven, Gums.

742
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:54,766
What hooker?

743
00:54:56,643 --> 00:54:58,144
10:00.

744
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:04,551
He got your gun
and your badge...

745
00:55:04,593 --> 00:55:06,678
and your teeth.

746
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:11,391
You are a disgrace
to the police force.

747
00:55:19,788 --> 00:55:24,209
Fuckin'
Junior "Bullshit" Gotlieb.

748
00:55:37,607 --> 00:55:39,651
Hey, you got
a piece, Eddie?

749
00:55:39,693 --> 00:55:40,986
Teeth?

750
00:55:41,027 --> 00:55:43,780
No. A gun. I need it.

751
00:55:43,822 --> 00:55:45,448
Hold on.

752
00:55:57,937 --> 00:55:59,814
Hair trigger.

753
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:02,984
Hollow points.

754
00:56:05,611 --> 00:56:06,862
Thanks, Eddie.

755
00:56:35,756 --> 00:56:36,685
Right in here.

756
00:57:04,026 --> 00:57:04,981
Where's Antonio?

757
00:57:28,081 --> 00:57:29,666
On your feet, pal.

758
00:57:32,752 --> 00:57:34,546
Turn around.

759
00:57:36,381 --> 00:57:37,799
Move it.

760
00:57:42,012 --> 00:57:43,388
Police raid!
Everybody freeze!

761
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:44,723
Run for it!

762
00:57:44,765 --> 00:57:46,475
Yo! Hey, guys!

763
00:57:46,516 --> 00:57:47,768
Come on back.
Where are you goin'?

764
00:57:47,809 --> 00:57:48,769
Come on.
I got this covered!

765
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:51,563
At ease, officer.

766
00:57:51,605 --> 00:57:54,441
I think you'd better
check with your superiors.

767
00:57:56,485 --> 00:57:59,237
Remain silent.

768
00:57:59,279 --> 00:58:02,991
Hey, I pay good money
to the right people, huh?

769
00:58:07,622 --> 00:58:09,291
Were you out
at the airport today?

770
00:58:09,332 --> 00:58:11,167
Was I out
at the airport today?

771
00:58:11,209 --> 00:58:12,335
What, are you crazy?

772
00:58:13,503 --> 00:58:15,171
You ever stood
in a line-up before?

773
00:58:15,213 --> 00:58:16,506
Oh, yeah. I stood in
a line-up before.

774
00:58:16,548 --> 00:58:18,049
OK. I want you to
line up there!

775
00:58:18,049 --> 00:58:19,801
Hey, what the hell's
going on here?

776
00:58:19,843 --> 00:58:21,219
Shut up!

777
00:58:25,824 --> 00:58:28,410
You own a suede
sports coat?

778
00:58:29,411 --> 00:58:31,538
Courtesy van?

779
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:33,540
You ain't no cop.

780
00:58:33,582 --> 00:58:35,209
Oh, I'm a cop.

781
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:37,794
Prove it, slick.
You're not walking...

782
00:58:41,641 --> 00:58:43,643
You crazy son of a bitch!

783
00:58:43,643 --> 00:58:45,186
I'll kick the living shit...

784
00:58:47,897 --> 00:58:49,566
Take it easy, Scanlan.

785
00:58:52,152 --> 00:58:55,280
Hey.

786
00:58:55,322 --> 00:58:57,324
Hey, Smiley.
How are you?

787
00:58:59,284 --> 00:59:01,036
Ellita Sanchez?

788
00:59:01,077 --> 00:59:03,538
Hoke Moseley.

789
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:04,664
I've been calling you.

790
00:59:04,706 --> 00:59:06,958
Don't they have someone
at that desk to answer?

791
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:12,339
Yeah...but he's deaf.
Got something?

792
00:59:13,465 --> 00:59:15,967
Prints I.D.
on those beer bottles.

793
00:59:20,013 --> 00:59:22,349
That's the son of a bitch!

794
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,941
"Frederick J. Frenger,
Junior."

795
00:59:30,982 --> 00:59:33,318
Junior Gotlieb.
I knew that was bullshit.

796
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:36,029
I got something
on the real Gotlieb.

797
00:59:36,071 --> 00:59:37,530
Mugged. D.O.A...

798
00:59:37,572 --> 00:59:39,366
at the San Francisco
Airport Hospital.

799
00:59:39,407 --> 00:59:41,326
That sound
like Junior's M.O.?

800
00:59:41,368 --> 00:59:42,827
Murder one.

801
00:59:42,869 --> 00:59:45,330
We can nail him as the
Krishna finger killer, I bet.

802
00:59:45,372 --> 00:59:47,958
He's grown up behind bars.

803
00:59:47,999 --> 00:59:50,460
And look at this.

804
00:59:50,502 --> 00:59:52,796
Someone charged
a suede sport coat...

805
00:59:52,837 --> 00:59:54,464
on the real Gotlieb's
credit card...

806
00:59:54,506 --> 00:59:54,917
after he was dead.

807
00:59:56,114 --> 00:59:57,950
We got the motherfucker!

808
00:59:57,991 --> 01:00:00,702
Thanks.

809
01:00:00,744 --> 01:00:02,621
I'm sorry. Habit.

810
01:00:02,663 --> 01:00:04,414
I ran his real name
by the utilities...

811
01:00:04,456 --> 01:00:05,749
but I turned up nothing.

812
01:00:05,791 --> 01:00:07,251
He wouldn't use
his real name.

813
01:00:07,292 --> 01:00:08,252
Well, if he did...

814
01:00:08,252 --> 01:00:09,920
we'd be knocking
on his door right now.

815
01:00:09,962 --> 01:00:11,296
What about Waggoner?

816
01:00:11,338 --> 01:00:13,382
I called every utility
in Dade.

817
01:00:13,423 --> 01:00:14,716
Even bottled water.

818
01:00:14,758 --> 01:00:15,801
I'm sitting here
having my lunch...

819
01:00:15,842 --> 01:00:17,427
waiting for
a call back, OK?

820
01:00:17,469 --> 01:00:19,930
Sitting on your lunch?

821
01:00:21,848 --> 01:00:23,475
Try Broward.

822
01:00:29,279 --> 01:00:31,406
Look, I know you think
I'm a weak suck...

823
01:00:31,448 --> 01:00:32,907
but I don't care.

824
01:00:32,949 --> 01:00:35,076
The guy who did this
to me...this Frenger...

825
01:00:35,118 --> 01:00:38,621
Junior...he's got
my old badge, Sanchez.

826
01:00:38,663 --> 01:00:39,956
He's running around
playing cop...

827
01:00:39,998 --> 01:00:41,750
assaulting
and beating people.

828
01:00:41,791 --> 01:00:45,920
I'm doing everything
I can to help.

829
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:50,600
Call me if you
hear anything.

830
01:01:29,949 --> 01:01:32,660
Put the funny book down!

831
01:01:32,702 --> 01:01:33,828
Give me the fuckin' cash...

832
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:35,955
or I'll blow
your fuckin' head off!

833
01:01:38,208 --> 01:01:40,210
No, don't count it,
Goddamn it!

834
01:01:40,251 --> 01:01:41,378
Police!

835
01:01:41,419 --> 01:01:44,714
Drop the gun, son.

836
01:01:46,024 --> 01:01:47,150
I know what it's like...

837
01:01:47,192 --> 01:01:48,652
to be on the other end
of that gun.

838
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:52,948
You're making
a big mistake.

839
01:01:52,990 --> 01:01:55,117
I tell you what...

840
01:01:55,158 --> 01:01:59,663
you put down the gun,
give back the money...

841
01:01:59,705 --> 01:02:01,665
and I'll let you
walk on out of here.

842
01:02:03,484 --> 01:02:05,403
You walk out that door...

843
01:02:05,445 --> 01:02:06,529
your life is
gonna change forever.

844
01:02:13,536 --> 01:02:15,997
Hold your fire,
you asshole!

845
01:02:20,536 --> 01:02:21,537
What the fuck?!

846
01:02:41,249 --> 01:02:43,084
Hey.

847
01:02:43,126 --> 01:02:44,878
Hey, you OK?

848
01:02:44,919 --> 01:02:46,379
Hey, mister.

849
01:02:48,673 --> 01:02:51,760
Get this thing off me.
I'm a cop.

850
01:03:01,428 --> 01:03:03,347
I think I hit him.

851
01:03:03,388 --> 01:03:06,058
You didn't hit shit.

852
01:03:08,444 --> 01:03:10,821
Where is
the whipping cream?

853
01:03:10,863 --> 01:03:13,157
We're out.

854
01:03:29,833 --> 01:03:32,794
Oh, my God.

855
01:03:32,836 --> 01:03:34,630
OK, I want you to do
something for me.

856
01:03:34,671 --> 01:03:37,799
Go get me some
cotton balls...aah!

857
01:03:37,841 --> 01:03:39,676
Some peroxide...

858
01:03:41,011 --> 01:03:42,387
some bandages...

859
01:03:42,429 --> 01:03:44,389
and bring me
a small mirror.

860
01:03:47,601 --> 01:03:51,229
Oh, God. Oh, God.

861
01:03:51,271 --> 01:03:52,898
Oh, fuck me.

862
01:03:59,348 --> 01:04:00,640
I want you to go
and get me...

863
01:04:00,682 --> 01:04:03,310
your smallest needle...
a small needle...

864
01:04:03,352 --> 01:04:05,479
and thread it
with black thread, OK?

865
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:16,015
Here. I got it.

866
01:04:20,186 --> 01:04:22,521
Oh, fuck. Oh, God.

867
01:04:24,607 --> 01:04:28,444
OK. Now...
I tell you what.

868
01:04:28,486 --> 01:04:34,575
I want you to sew
my eyebrow back on.

869
01:04:34,617 --> 01:04:36,535
Hey, hey!
Now, come on, come on.

870
01:04:36,577 --> 01:04:38,037
Come on.
You're gonna be OK.

871
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:39,038
I got it.

872
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:40,748
I'm sorry.
I'm no good at this.

873
01:04:40,790 --> 01:04:42,416
I got it.

874
01:04:46,062 --> 01:04:47,981
What? OK.

875
01:04:48,023 --> 01:04:50,150
I got you.

876
01:04:50,192 --> 01:04:52,652
I'm going to
get you a doctor.

877
01:04:52,694 --> 01:04:54,654
Oh, no. No doctors.

878
01:04:57,199 --> 01:04:59,660
I want you to get me
a bottle of gin.

879
01:04:59,702 --> 01:05:03,747
I nursed my husband for
3 years before he died...

880
01:05:03,789 --> 01:05:05,624
but you're not
going to die.

881
01:05:07,751 --> 01:05:09,837
Here.

882
01:05:09,878 --> 01:05:10,838
It's gin, Junior.

883
01:05:10,879 --> 01:05:12,297
Drink it.

884
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:20,340
We're going to need this.

885
01:05:21,675 --> 01:05:23,510
This is going to hurt.

886
01:05:26,054 --> 01:05:29,266
You move, and you're
a blind man. Scissors.

887
01:05:35,814 --> 01:05:38,025
Hold it. Hold it.

888
01:05:42,671 --> 01:05:45,174
You're doing real good,
Junior.

889
01:05:45,216 --> 01:05:47,218
I'm just gonna
move down a bit.

890
01:05:47,259 --> 01:05:49,970
Now we just have one more.

891
01:05:50,012 --> 01:05:52,056
Just hold on.

892
01:06:09,448 --> 01:06:13,369
That'll hold you.

893
01:06:13,411 --> 01:06:16,414
Your husband must have
been glad to die.

894
01:06:18,442 --> 01:06:19,944
Thank you.

895
01:06:19,985 --> 01:06:21,070
Yeah, thanks.

896
01:06:21,112 --> 01:06:23,405
You got a real nice
touch there, lady.

897
01:06:35,009 --> 01:06:38,596
So...are you going to
tell me about it?

898
01:06:38,638 --> 01:06:41,057
Yeah, I'll tell you
about it.

899
01:06:41,098 --> 01:06:43,684
This straight life
that we've been living...

900
01:06:43,726 --> 01:06:46,062
has been giving me this
misplaced sense of security!

901
01:06:46,103 --> 01:06:47,563
I thought for
one minute there...

902
01:06:47,605 --> 01:06:50,983
I was some kind of fuckin'
solid citizen or something.

903
01:06:51,927 --> 01:06:54,972
All I want to know
is what happened to you.

904
01:06:59,185 --> 01:07:02,313
Some guy in a blue
Toyota pickup ran me over.

905
01:07:03,522 --> 01:07:05,941
I thought it must have been
something like that.

906
01:07:10,029 --> 01:07:12,990
An anonymous, apparently
off-duty, police officer...

907
01:07:13,032 --> 01:07:14,492
interrupted
a robbery tonight...

908
01:07:14,533 --> 01:07:16,327
at a Coral Gables
convenience store...

909
01:07:16,369 --> 01:07:18,371
heroically confronting
an armed robber...

910
01:07:18,412 --> 01:07:20,831
with only bottles
of spaghetti sauce.

911
01:07:32,386 --> 01:07:33,679
Yeah?

912
01:07:33,721 --> 01:07:35,931
Ellita Sanchez.

913
01:07:50,928 --> 01:07:51,457
Come in.

914
01:07:58,931 --> 01:08:00,224
What's this?

915
01:08:00,265 --> 01:08:03,185
Susan Waggoner.
Telephone order.

916
01:08:03,185 --> 01:08:04,812
There's an address
in the Gables.

917
01:08:07,022 --> 01:08:09,149
The Gables.

918
01:08:10,901 --> 01:08:12,069
What time is it?

919
01:08:12,111 --> 01:08:14,822
It's 1:00. I was
going out on a date.

920
01:08:14,863 --> 01:08:15,989
I've got a relative
with Southern Bell...

921
01:08:16,031 --> 01:08:18,033
or we wouldn't have gotten
the number for days.

922
01:08:18,033 --> 01:08:19,451
That's great. Thanks.

923
01:08:20,661 --> 01:08:22,162
What are you
going to do?

924
01:08:23,189 --> 01:08:24,816
I'm going to
check it out.

925
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:29,403
Sanchez...

926
01:08:29,445 --> 01:08:31,489
thanks.

927
01:08:54,865 --> 01:08:56,534
You feeling better?

928
01:09:01,997 --> 01:09:04,375
What would you like
for breakfast?

929
01:09:11,507 --> 01:09:13,467
You're not hungry?

930
01:09:17,555 --> 01:09:19,640
Well, I'm just
gonna run some errands...

931
01:09:19,682 --> 01:09:21,350
and then I'll be back.

932
01:09:31,152 --> 01:09:33,029
I love you.

933
01:10:46,205 --> 01:10:47,748
Oh, I'm sorry.

934
01:10:47,790 --> 01:10:51,585
Hey. Susan, uh...
Waggoner, right?

935
01:10:51,627 --> 01:10:53,337
Remember me?

936
01:10:53,379 --> 01:10:54,422
No, sir.

937
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:57,216
Hoke "Pork Chops" Moseley.

938
01:10:59,135 --> 01:11:00,845
God, what
happened to you?

939
01:11:00,886 --> 01:11:03,514
Ah, some psycho
jumped me...

940
01:11:03,556 --> 01:11:04,900
almost broke my neck...

941
01:11:05,385 --> 01:11:06,124
stole my gun, my badge,
and my teeth.

942
01:11:07,308 --> 01:11:08,392
Teeth?

943
01:11:08,434 --> 01:11:09,977
Yeah. These are temps.

944
01:11:10,019 --> 01:11:12,521
Hey, I got
something for you.

945
01:11:12,563 --> 01:11:14,148
Do you do your
marketing here?

946
01:11:14,189 --> 01:11:15,774
Excuse me, would you
like to try some sausage?

947
01:11:15,816 --> 01:11:16,775
No, thank you.

948
01:11:16,817 --> 01:11:18,485
Are you sure?
It's really good.

949
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:21,530
Remember that...

950
01:11:21,572 --> 01:11:24,283
pork chop recipe
I promised you...

951
01:11:24,325 --> 01:11:26,327
with the chestnut batter?

952
01:11:26,903 --> 01:11:28,988
Glad I ran into you.

953
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:31,324
Oh, this is great.

954
01:11:31,366 --> 01:11:32,992
I can't believe
you remembered.

955
01:11:33,034 --> 01:11:34,494
That is so nice of you.

956
01:11:34,536 --> 01:11:35,829
I'm gonna
put it on my list...

957
01:11:35,870 --> 01:11:37,080
and I'm gonna
make it tonight.

958
01:11:37,122 --> 01:11:39,082
Hey, is that
an invitation?

959
01:11:39,124 --> 01:11:40,056
I'll be there.

960
01:11:40,570 --> 01:11:40,826
Oh.

961
01:11:42,452 --> 01:11:45,872
I got class tonight.
I'm sorry.

962
01:11:47,958 --> 01:11:49,292
You're still
with that guy, huh?

963
01:11:49,334 --> 01:11:52,879
No. Umm...
I kicked him out.

964
01:11:52,921 --> 01:11:56,550
Well, good for you.

965
01:11:56,591 --> 01:11:58,760
You know
who he really is?

966
01:11:58,802 --> 01:12:00,178
He's a murderer.

967
01:12:00,220 --> 01:12:03,056
Herman Gotlieb
isn't even his real name.

968
01:12:03,098 --> 01:12:04,558
He spent his life in prison.

969
01:12:04,927 --> 01:12:05,154
Frederick J. Frenger,
Junior

970
01:12:08,103 --> 01:12:08,684
Junior.

971
01:12:09,319 --> 01:12:10,804
Hate to run into Senior.

972
01:12:13,182 --> 01:12:14,254
Oh...

973
01:12:14,255 --> 01:12:16,897
hey, you ever made
vinegar pie?

974
01:12:16,938 --> 01:12:20,442
Vinegar pie?
My mother used to make it.

975
01:12:20,484 --> 01:12:22,110
I can still taste it.

976
01:12:22,152 --> 01:12:24,529
Oh. Seedless raisins
for a start.

977
01:12:24,571 --> 01:12:26,698
Chop 'em up real fine.

978
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:28,450
And you beat the egg
yolks and the butter...

979
01:12:28,492 --> 01:12:29,451
until they're creamy...

980
01:12:29,493 --> 01:12:31,161
Wait a second.

981
01:12:31,203 --> 01:12:33,121
And you beat
the egg whites...

982
01:12:33,163 --> 01:12:34,122
until they're stiff...

983
01:12:34,164 --> 01:12:36,124
and then you
fold them in...

984
01:12:36,208 --> 01:12:38,251
and you take
one cup of sugar...

985
01:12:38,293 --> 01:12:39,586
and, um...

986
01:12:39,628 --> 01:12:41,380
here's
the tricky part, OK?

987
01:12:41,421 --> 01:12:42,464
This is the key.

988
01:12:42,506 --> 01:12:45,509
You use 5% vinegar,
no stronger.

989
01:12:45,550 --> 01:12:47,844
And just 3 teaspoons,
that's all.

990
01:12:47,886 --> 01:12:48,614
Just 3 little teaspoons.

991
01:12:49,772 --> 01:12:52,858
That's where Mama
went wrong.

992
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:56,737
Yeah, probably so.

993
01:12:56,779 --> 01:12:59,114
You don't know
where I could...

994
01:12:59,156 --> 01:13:01,992
find that old boyfriend
of yours, do you?

995
01:13:02,034 --> 01:13:06,705
No. He's gone for good.

996
01:13:06,747 --> 01:13:08,832
I know you wouldn't
lie for him.

997
01:13:08,874 --> 01:13:12,002
He was the liar.

998
01:13:10,394 --> 01:13:13,022
Well, uhh...
enjoy that recipe.

999
01:13:13,063 --> 01:13:14,148
I will.

1000
01:13:14,189 --> 01:13:16,442
Look, my number's on it.

1001
01:13:16,483 --> 01:13:19,904
If you really like it,
give me a call.

1002
01:13:24,241 --> 01:13:26,577
Oh, my God.

1003
01:13:28,955 --> 01:13:30,582
One.

1004
01:13:33,793 --> 01:13:35,461
Two.

1005
01:13:55,064 --> 01:13:56,816
Three.

1006
01:14:19,072 --> 01:14:20,699
What are you
doing tomorrow?

1007
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:23,368
I was gonna paint
the security bars.

1008
01:14:23,410 --> 01:14:26,371
Oh, no. I got
a million errands...

1009
01:14:26,413 --> 01:14:29,040
I gotta run tomorrow.
I wanted to go in...

1010
01:14:29,082 --> 01:14:31,001
and cash in
my coin collection.

1011
01:14:31,042 --> 01:14:32,794
I need you to drive me
around some.

1012
01:14:32,836 --> 01:14:34,546
We'll be done by noon.

1013
01:14:34,588 --> 01:14:36,214
Can't you drive?

1014
01:14:36,256 --> 01:14:40,552
Oh, no way, honey. Heh!
Honey, I gotta...-

1015
01:14:40,594 --> 01:14:42,304
I'm gonna be hoppin'
in and out...

1016
01:14:42,345 --> 01:14:43,763
of a hundred different
places.

1017
01:14:43,805 --> 01:14:46,266
Cost me a fortune
just to park...

1018
01:14:46,349 --> 01:14:48,351
if I could find a place.

1019
01:14:48,736 --> 01:14:50,738
That dessert?

1020
01:14:50,822 --> 01:14:53,908
I'll bring it to you.
Just go sit down.

1021
01:15:37,061 --> 01:15:39,563
So, you gonna drive me
around tomorrow?

1022
01:15:39,605 --> 01:15:42,191
Junior, are you sure
this is just an errand?

1023
01:15:42,233 --> 01:15:45,569
You promised no more
illegal stuff.

1024
01:15:45,611 --> 01:15:51,784
You saved my life, Susie.

1025
01:15:51,826 --> 01:15:53,619
Would I fuck up
the best thing...

1026
01:15:53,661 --> 01:15:54,829
that ever happened
to me...

1027
01:15:54,870 --> 01:15:58,165
just to make you
some kind of a wheelman?

1028
01:15:58,817 --> 01:16:01,528
Would you?

1029
01:16:02,754 --> 01:16:05,257
We made a deal.

1030
01:16:05,298 --> 01:16:07,300
I promised.

1031
01:16:17,645 --> 01:16:19,522
Like it?

1032
01:16:20,523 --> 01:16:22,942
This is really great.

1033
01:16:25,695 --> 01:16:27,655
It's great!

1034
01:16:29,699 --> 01:16:31,200
Great.

1035
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:35,413
One of your best.

1036
01:18:09,102 --> 01:18:11,271
If a cop should
hassle you...

1037
01:18:11,313 --> 01:18:13,315
then you just drive on
around the block.

1038
01:18:13,357 --> 01:18:15,233
Why would anyone
hassle me?

1039
01:18:15,275 --> 01:18:17,778
You parked
in a yellow zone.

1040
01:18:41,162 --> 01:18:42,955
Police officer.

1041
01:18:42,997 --> 01:18:44,332
Buzz me in.

1042
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:25,133
You say these coins
are stolen, Sergeant?

1043
01:19:25,174 --> 01:19:27,260
Sergeant, uh...

1044
01:19:27,301 --> 01:19:28,720
Moseley.

1045
01:19:28,761 --> 01:19:30,680
Homicide.

1046
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:32,974
We picked him up
on a fencing sting.

1047
01:19:33,016 --> 01:19:34,934
We figure if we could
get a line on the owners...

1048
01:19:34,976 --> 01:19:37,145
we could solve the crime.

1049
01:19:38,312 --> 01:19:40,440
This a valuable
collection or what?

1050
01:19:40,481 --> 01:19:43,359
It's by no means
a rare collection.

1051
01:19:44,569 --> 01:19:51,325
When I take
this fleeting breath

1052
01:19:51,367 --> 01:19:58,583
When my eyes,
they close in death

1053
01:20:03,506 --> 01:20:05,966
Just a cursory look
at these coins...

1054
01:20:05,966 --> 01:20:07,927
tells me they're
in fair condition.

1055
01:20:07,968 --> 01:20:10,596
That was cursory?

1056
01:20:10,638 --> 01:20:12,640
You ever seen them before?

1057
01:20:12,681 --> 01:20:15,643
Seen lots like them.

1058
01:20:15,643 --> 01:20:17,686
What happened
to your eye?

1059
01:20:17,728 --> 01:20:19,730
Car accident.

1060
01:20:19,814 --> 01:20:22,399
You should sue the doctor
who sewed you up.

1061
01:20:22,441 --> 01:20:23,859
You could make a bundle.

1062
01:20:23,901 --> 01:20:26,612
He said it'd be fine
after it scarred over.

1063
01:20:26,654 --> 01:20:28,531
He lied.

1064
01:20:28,572 --> 01:20:31,408
How come
a homicide detective...

1065
01:20:31,450 --> 01:20:34,662
is so interested
in stolen property?

1066
01:20:34,703 --> 01:20:38,457
First of all, that's
confidential information.

1067
01:20:38,499 --> 01:20:40,960
Second of all, I'll ask all
the questions around here.

1068
01:20:42,795 --> 01:20:44,630
I'm working on a tip.

1069
01:20:44,672 --> 01:20:46,757
I'm thinking of putting
a stakeout in here.

1070
01:20:46,799 --> 01:20:49,510
You know, before
I put that window in...

1071
01:20:49,552 --> 01:20:51,679
I was hit 3 times
in one month...

1072
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:54,014
but I don't need
no stakeout now.

1073
01:20:54,056 --> 01:20:55,891
Yeah? Why's that?

1074
01:20:55,933 --> 01:20:58,519
Because of Pedro. Pedro!!!

1075
01:21:00,548 --> 01:21:02,550
He's been watching you
the whole time...

1076
01:21:02,591 --> 01:21:04,218
through a peephole
in the door.

1077
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:07,012
It's OK, Pedro.

1078
01:21:07,054 --> 01:21:09,181
This is Sergeant Moseley.

1079
01:21:14,457 --> 01:21:14,856
He's with the
police department.

1080
01:21:21,219 --> 01:21:24,556
You bitch!

1081
01:21:55,923 --> 01:21:57,216
Oh, God.

1082
01:22:26,805 --> 01:22:28,724
You promised!

1083
01:22:28,765 --> 01:22:30,475
What the fuck
are you doing?!

1084
01:22:34,479 --> 01:22:38,525
-Freeze! Police!
-Freeze! Police!

1085
01:22:42,279 --> 01:22:43,488
Hold it.

1086
01:22:52,497 --> 01:22:54,082
Hey, move it!

1087
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:11,535
Stop! Police!

1088
01:23:15,230 --> 01:23:16,565
Get out of the car!

1089
01:23:18,317 --> 01:23:19,484
Shit.

1090
01:24:26,589 --> 01:24:28,132
What happened to you?

1091
01:24:28,174 --> 01:24:31,135
Raise your hands level
with your shoulders.

1092
01:24:31,177 --> 01:24:34,972
What are you gonna do
if I don't, Sarge?

1093
01:24:35,014 --> 01:24:36,307
Shoot me?

1094
01:24:36,348 --> 01:24:37,641
What was the bullshit...

1095
01:24:37,683 --> 01:24:39,977
with the money
you left me...

1096
01:24:40,019 --> 01:24:41,395
Frederick?

1097
01:24:45,941 --> 01:24:47,860
I don't give
nothing away.

1098
01:24:47,902 --> 01:24:50,821
What did the Krishna
do to die?

1099
01:24:50,863 --> 01:24:52,823
Where did you get
that jacket?

1100
01:24:52,865 --> 01:24:55,659
Herman Gotlieb.

1101
01:24:59,706 --> 01:25:02,334
Stand up.
Back up slowly.

1102
01:25:02,375 --> 01:25:03,627
Turn around
and face the wall.

1103
01:25:03,668 --> 01:25:05,754
I don't think
I can do that.

1104
01:25:05,796 --> 01:25:08,089
I'll pass out.

1105
01:25:08,131 --> 01:25:09,758
Most of my fingers
have been cut off...

1106
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:12,302
and I'll probably go into
shock any minute now.

1107
01:25:12,344 --> 01:25:13,637
Move it!

1108
01:25:18,584 --> 01:25:23,589
Everything's turning
all orange and silver.

1109
01:25:45,688 --> 01:25:49,318
Susie's going to
get you, Sarge.

1110
01:27:02,993 --> 01:27:04,662
Hello.

1111
01:27:16,891 --> 01:27:19,060
Did you kill him?

1112
01:27:30,530 --> 01:27:32,991
Good-bye, Junior.

1113
01:27:35,535 --> 01:27:37,662
You don't have to answer
if you don't want to...

1114
01:27:37,704 --> 01:27:42,084
but, uh...gotta clear
a few things up.

1115
01:27:44,252 --> 01:27:46,755
Did you know Junior
was gonna rob the store?

1116
01:27:46,797 --> 01:27:50,342
I was hoping he wouldn't.

1117
01:27:50,384 --> 01:27:53,011
He swore to me.

1118
01:27:53,053 --> 01:27:55,347
I had to give him
the benefit of the doubt...

1119
01:27:55,389 --> 01:27:57,641
because he had
some good qualities.

1120
01:27:57,683 --> 01:28:01,853
He always ate everything
I ever cooked for him.

1121
01:28:02,013 --> 01:28:04,224
And he never hit me.

1122
01:28:07,811 --> 01:28:11,731
There were lots of good
things about Junior.

1123
01:28:11,773 --> 01:28:14,151
Listen, Hoke, this is
exactly what happened...

1124
01:28:14,192 --> 01:28:15,986
or you're in big
jurisdictional trouble.

1125
01:28:16,027 --> 01:28:18,488
You were tailing him...
a murder suspect.

1126
01:28:18,530 --> 01:28:19,990
You see him coming
out of the coin shop...

1127
01:28:20,031 --> 01:28:21,199
with a gun in his hand.

1128
01:28:21,241 --> 01:28:23,160
Suspecting him of robbery,
you called for back-up...

1129
01:28:23,201 --> 01:28:24,202
and you followed him
to the house.

1130
01:28:24,244 --> 01:28:26,538
He pulled a gun on you,
and you shot him.

1131
01:28:26,580 --> 01:28:27,622
Something like that.

1132
01:28:27,706 --> 01:28:29,416
Exactly like that.

1133
01:28:29,457 --> 01:28:32,669
There's only one problem,
though: the girl.

1134
01:28:32,711 --> 01:28:34,754
She'll blow holes
in this story.

1135
01:28:34,796 --> 01:28:36,131
Cut her loose.

1136
01:28:36,833 --> 01:28:39,043
Is she really
Princess Not-So-Bright...

1137
01:28:39,085 --> 01:28:41,045
or is she just pretending?

1138
01:28:41,087 --> 01:28:42,338
Ah, she's been
through hell.

1139
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:43,715
Leave her alone.

1140
01:28:48,928 --> 01:28:51,931
Let's get the fuck
out of here.

1141
01:28:51,973 --> 01:28:53,641
You look different.

1142
01:28:53,683 --> 01:28:55,852
I got my teeth back.
