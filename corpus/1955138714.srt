Hey, Dad.

345

Hey.

346

What's going on?

347

348
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,080
I thought  the cars didn't work.

353

It's about time.

354

&lt;i&gt; Let's get you people&lt;/i&gt;   &lt;i&gt; out of here.&lt;/i&gt;

359

We should be ready to go at a moment's notice, all right?

360
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,280
Stay with your sister, Sam.

361
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,320
Come on.

362
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,240

&lt;i&gt; Adults, please move to&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt; the mess hall for a briefing.&lt;/i&gt;

368
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,080
Do you think they have electricity if the trucks are working?

369
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,320
I don't know. Why, you still have a phone?

370
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,320
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

371
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,840
You have a charger?

372
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,840
Of course, yeah.

373
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,960
Whoa, whoa, sir, sir.

374
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,960
Yeah?

375
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,600
My orders are to  get just the kids  onto the bus.

376
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,880
Well, those might  be your orders,  but they're my kids.

377
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,520
Yeah.

378
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,520
So we're gonna   stay together.

379
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,960
We'll wait for another bus.

380
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,960
It's okay, Private.

381
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,320
I got this.

382
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,040
Yes, sir.

383
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,040
Thank you.

384
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,840
Look, you're   welcome to keep 'em here   with you if you want,

385
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,440
but if they were my kids,  I'd get 'em on that bus.

386
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,600
Why?

387
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,240
We have reason to believethere's an imminentthreat to this location.

388
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,320
We're trying to get  everyone to safety  as quickly as we can,

389
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,000
and this is the only working transpo we've got,

390
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,400
so we're taking shifts based on need.

391
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,680
Kids first,then we come backfor the rest of ya.

392
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,680
Well, how safe is it at Wright-Patterson?

393
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,960
Safest placethere is right now.

394
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,960
And the buses will just come right back?

395
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,400
Dad, no.

396
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,160
Drop 'em off,   come right back.

397
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,400
Like I said,   it's your call.

398
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,080
Just 'cause some man in uniform tries to tell us what to do

399
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,080
doesn't mean weactually have tofollow his orders.

400
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,240
Okay, I want you on   this one, all right?

401
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,240
I'll be right behind you.

402
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,240
We can't split up.

403
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,560
And we're gonna have   dinner tonight. We're   going to the same place.

404
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,480
Dad, no.

406
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,880
It's the Army, okay?   This is our Army. It's fine.   It's gonna be okay.

407
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,680
Don't leave me alone.

418

Here, head to the back, Sam.

They are moving among us.

466
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,240
Apparently, they have the ability to inhabit human hosts

467
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,680
and control their actions.

468
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,960
So, they look like humans?

That's correct.

They could be anywhere.

473
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,480
and they are   targeting survivors.

move you all to  a secure holding facility

487

I'm sorry.

870
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:13,040
I'll get you there.

871
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:15,920
I can't promise  what you'll find,  but I will get you there.

You don't know anything about me.

Let me guess.

879
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:43,360
You did good in school, had a bunch of friends.

880
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,880
You probably played football.

881
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,840
You might have even been team captain.

882
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,520
Life was easy.

883
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,360
And then, all of a sudden, it wasn't.

884
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:56,400
No more games to win.

885
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,640
No one to get weak-kneed at that pretty smile.

886

And you were?

888
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,160
I know how to survive.

889
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:10,240
And I was doing fine out there on my own.

Till they forced me onto their stupid school bus.

891
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,080
They were rescuing us.

892
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:16,520
We didn't get rescued, dumbass. We got drafted.

893
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:18,520

I promised Sam that   I would be there for him   no matter what.

Point it at my chest.

923
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,640
Okay. Grab the barrel of the gun with your left,

924
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:24,560
and with your right,   snap my hand away.

as the detector viewer from medical.

We've improved it. Made it mobile.

The idea is to allow  our soldiers in the field

957

to instantly differentiate between friend and foe.

958

You look atthe enemy through thisand it lights 'em up green.

Why would the Army want us to kill other humans?

1209

1210

they're the Others.

1211

01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:24,560
I was tryingto protect him.

1224
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:26,320
Jeez.

1225
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:28,120
I gotta go back.

1226
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:28,120
That's suicide, dude.

1227
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,320
No, man. I gotta go back.

1228
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:30,400
You can't just wander back in there.

1229
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:31,880
They'll know.

1230
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:31,880
I can't leave him there!

1231
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:34,120
I'll put the tracker   back in. They'll   pick me up.

1232
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:36,080
You guys go ahead. I will meet up with you later.

1233
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:38,520
Dumbo, where can I take a bullet in the torso and not die?

1234
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:43,880
Are you serious?

1235
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:43,880
I'm not kidding, man.

1236
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:46,320
Where can I take a bullet in the torso? I gotta make it look real.

1237
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:47,560
It's the only way I'm getting back in alive.

1238
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:50,080
It's impossible, man. There's too many organs.

1239
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:51,360
There's gotta be  somewhere, man.

1241

If I was gonna  kill you, Cassie,

1265

I would've done it a long time ago.

What are you?

1267
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:51,040
You're one of them. You're a fucking Other.

1268
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:51,920
I'm human.

1269
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,080
But I'm Other, too.

1270
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:57,560
I'm both.

1271
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:03,280
This isn't the first time the Others have been here.

1272
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:05,680
They came before   and created   sleeper agents, like me.

1273
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:08,560
I always felt different.

1274
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:13,680
Growing up, there was this voice in my head.

1275
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:15,560
It was quiet,  but it was there.

1276
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:17,560
And when the ship arrived,

1277
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:22,120
it was like a switch was flipped inside me,

1278
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:24,320
and the sleeper woke up.

1279
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,040
How many people have you killed?

1280
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:35,680
Did you kill your family?

1281
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:37,520
No.

1282

The disease...

1283
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:40,560
The disease that the Others created.

1284
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:42,480
The disease that you created.

1285
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:45,600
Your family loved you.

1286
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:48,120
Our kind believe that  love is just a trick.

1287
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:50,800
An instinct.

Do you really believe that?

1290
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:00,960
I did.

1291
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:05,680

1295
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:41,840
It was like you   flipped the switch back.

1296
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:44,880
You made me  wanna be human again.

1297

1399
01:30:58,200 --> 01:30:59,920
&lt;i&gt; ? ?&lt;/i&gt;

1400
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:05,520
(EXPLOSION)

1401
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:26,080
SOLDIER 2: South corridor!   On the double!

1402
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:27,400
&lt;i&gt; ? ?&lt;/i&gt;

1403
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:38,560
They're taking out our security cameras.

1404
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:41,880
Bring the drones home so we can see who's attacking us.

1405
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:44,760
SOLDIER 3:  Yeah, these are the changes  from about 60 minutes ago.

1406
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:47,600
&lt;i&gt; ? ?&lt;/i&gt;

1407
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:53,360
Hey!

1408
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:55,440
Don't move, all right! Don't move!

1409
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:55,440
It's okay! Okay, all right!

1410
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:57,920
Cassie? My name's Ben Parish. We used to go to high school together.

1411
01:31:57,960 --> 01:31:59,360
I know who you are.

1412
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:01,240
What squad are you in?

1413
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:04,200
I'm looking for   my brother, Sam.

1414
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:05,840
Sam?

1415
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:08,720
Sam Sullivan? Sam Sullivan?

1416
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:10,680
You know my brother?

1417
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:10,680
Yes, yes, we're in the same squad.

1418
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:12,240
You know where he is?

1419
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:12,240
I'm trying to get to him right now.

1420
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:14,720
SOLDIER: &lt;i&gt; All recruits&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt; report to the transport area.&lt;/i&gt;

1421
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:16,400
They're sending the kids off to war.

1422
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:18,040
Vosch. The Army. They're Others.

1423
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:20,480
Look, Sam is about to get on one of those planes.

1424
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:22,720
If we don't go now, you're not gonna see him again. You understand?

1425
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:23,360
We don't have much time.

1426
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:26,080
&lt;i&gt; All recruits report&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt; to the transport area.&lt;/i&gt;

1427
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:26,080
All right.

1428
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:27,280
Ready?

1429
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:27,280
Come on.

1430
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:32,240
Once the recruitsreach Wonderland,

1431
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:33,680
get them ready for  immediate deployment.

1432
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:34,680
Yes, sir.

1433
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:40,880
Transfer area's this way.

1434
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:49,240
Hey!

1435
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,280
This is a restricted area.

1436
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:54,280
Hey, it's all right.

1437
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:54,280
On your knees!

1438
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:55,120
Hands behind your head!

1439
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:06,480
No, it's fine.   He's one of us.   It's okay.

1440
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:07,800
Evan, what are you doing here?

1441
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:08,720
Helping you.

1442
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:12,400
Who's he?

1443
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:15,400
Ben Parish.

1444
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:18,040
Ben Parish?

1445
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:19,960
Yeah. Uh...

1446
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:23,000
He was just here.

1447
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:29,400
I told you not to follow me.

1448
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:31,280
Well, I decided to ignore you.

1449
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:34,560
I've been planting bombs.

1450
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:37,400
In about 10 minutes, when the last plane full of kids takes off,

1451
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:39,440
I'm taking this place down, for good.

1452
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:42,960
I'm sorry I lied to you, Cassie.

1453
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:50,040
I was wrong when I said I was both one of you and one of them.

1454
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:52,480
You can't be both. You have to choose.

1455
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:55,600
I choose you.

1456
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:57,400
&lt;i&gt; ? ?&lt;/i&gt;

1457
01:34:08,240 --> 01:34:08,840
Go.

1458
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:11,680
Get out of here.

1459
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:13,720
I'll find you.

1460
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:18,760
Who was that?

1461
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:19,520
Evan Walker.

1462
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:22,480
We gotta go find Sam.

1463
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:25,520
I think Evan Walker's about to blow this place up.

1464
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:26,480
&lt;i&gt; ? ?&lt;/i&gt;

1465
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:31,080
Next floor up.

1466
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:34,680
SOLDIER 4: Head tothe northeast corridor,number 22, now!

1467
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:35,800
Which way?

1468
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:37,600
This way.

1469
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:50,200
SOLDIER: (OVER MICROPHONE)  &lt;i&gt; Stay with your group leader.&lt;/i&gt;

1470
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:58,640
&lt;i&gt; Proceed to the transport vehicles in a calm and orderly fashion.&lt;/i&gt;

1471
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:01,680
&lt;i&gt; Stay with your group leader.&lt;/i&gt;

1472
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:06,640
&lt;i&gt; Proceed to the transport vehicles.&lt;/i&gt;

1473
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:08,880
SOLDIER 2: Come on.  Move along, people.

1474
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:10,280
Straight ahead.

1475
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:11,480
&lt;i&gt; Stay with your group leader.&lt;/i&gt;

1476
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:13,200
Keep it moving.

1477
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:14,480
Don't fall behind, everyone.

1478
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:16,200
Where do they think they're going?

1479
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:19,360
&lt;i&gt; Once you are on the plane,&lt;/i&gt;   &lt;i&gt; you will receive&lt;/i&gt;   &lt;i&gt; further instructions.&lt;/i&gt;

1480
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:21,400
Keep moving. Straight ahead.

1481
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:22,680
&lt;i&gt; Stay with your group leader.&lt;/i&gt;

1482
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:30,520
What's her problem?

1483
01:35:33,240 --> 01:35:35,400
Sam! Sam!

1484
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:45,720
Sam! Sam! Sam.

1485
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:47,560
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1486
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:49,680
Hi.

1487
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:50,840
Cassie!

1488
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:50,840
Don't, don't.

1489
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:53,440
We gotta go, all right?

1490
01:35:56,840 --> 01:35:59,280
Let's go.

1491
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:02,000
&lt;i&gt; Once you are on the plane,&lt;/i&gt;   &lt;i&gt; you will receive&lt;/i&gt;   &lt;i&gt; further instructions.&lt;/i&gt;

1492
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,040
Come on.

1493
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:08,160
Hi!

1494
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:10,640
I missed you so much, Sam.

1495
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:12,080
&lt;i&gt; ? ?&lt;/i&gt;

1496
01:36:14,440 --> 01:36:16,560
I missed you, Cassie.

1497
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:17,760
Look what I  brought back for you.

1498
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:20,720
It's Bear.

1499
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:25,120
I love you.

1500
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:29,200
I love you, too, Sam.

1501
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:30,880
Hey. Um...

1502
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:34,880
I gotta take his tracker out.

1503
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:36,120
All right? It's not gonna hurt, okay?

1504
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:42,280
(EXPLOSION)

1505
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:44,920
Is it back up?

1506
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:46,080
All the recruits  accounted for?

1507
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:47,600
Yes, sir. Six barracks left.

1508
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:49,000
Good.

1509
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:51,920
Power up my bird.   Last plane's in the air,   evacuate the base.

1510
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:06,480
Come on!

1511
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,280
Shit! It's Vosch!

1512
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:28,560
Run! Run! Go for the truck!

1513
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:42,400
Go!

1514
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:43,640
Sam, run faster!

1515
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:49,040
Go! Go!

1516
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:58,480
Come on, Sam!

1517
01:38:00,240 --> 01:38:01,360
Run!

1518
01:38:00,240 --> 01:38:01,360
Cassie!

1519
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:03,280
Oh, shit!

1520
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:05,080
Who is that?

1521
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:09,760
Come on!

1522
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:09,760
Come on! Get in!

1523
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:13,080
Come on!

1524
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:14,640
Quick, Sammy. Get in!

1525
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:15,520
All right, come on! Get in! Get in!

1526
01:38:16,280 --> 01:38:17,680
Drive!

1527
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:24,280
Thanks for coming back.

1528
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:27,440
(EXPLOSIONS CONTINUE)

1529
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:33,200
&lt;i&gt; ? ?&lt;/i&gt;

1530
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:01,600
DUMBO: Feel better?

1531
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:01,600
ZOMBIE: Yeah, thanks, Dumbo.

1532
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:04,720
Make sure you give her the food first.

1533
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:06,320
DUMBO: Let me know if it starts hurting or anything like that.

1534
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:07,800
Okay.

1535
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:07,800
All right.

1536
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:09,520
Teacup,   how you feeling?

1537
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:09,960
Pretty good.

1538
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:12,080
RINGER: All right.

1539
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:22,960
How much longer for food?

1540
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:24,080
DUMBO: I don't know. Not long.

1541
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:26,240
What are you looking at?

1542
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:28,680
Trying to find the stars.

1543
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:33,360
It's a little early,   isn't it?

1544
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:33,360
(CHUCKLES)

1545
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:37,520
You were named after a star, right?

1546
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:41,360
Cassiopeia.

1547
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:43,280
Cassiopeia.

1548
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:47,040
Yeah. A cluster of stars.

1549
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:51,200
I was named   after Ben &amp;amp; Jerry's.

1550
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:53,760
The truth. Yeah.

1551
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:57,160
Nothing made my dad happier than ice cream.

1552
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:04,400
I'm sure  you made him happier.

1553
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:11,640
Yeah.

1554
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:16,400
So, uh...

1555
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,680
What do we do now?

1556
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:23,440
We have to save  those other kids.

1557
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:25,080
Yeah.

1558
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:26,680
How are we gonna do that?

1559
01:40:27,640 --> 01:40:29,000
Dinner's ready.

1560
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:30,880
I don't know yet.

1561
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:36,280
Well...

1562
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:40,600
Let's worry  about that tomorrow

1563
01:40:40,120 --> 01:40:42,800
and just go get   something to eat.

1564
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:45,520
All right.

1565
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:47,520
Hey, Sam.

1566
01:40:47,560 --> 01:40:48,560
Here, wake up, buddy.

1567
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:52,000
Hey, there he is.

1568
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:53,880
Come on.

1569
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:57,840
Come on, lazy bones.   Put your bear down,   would you?

1570
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:09,200
CASSIE: &lt;i&gt; The Others see our hope as a weakness,&lt;/i&gt;

1571
01:41:10,640 --> 01:41:12,080
&lt;i&gt; as a delusion.&lt;/i&gt;

1572
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:15,280
&lt;i&gt; But they're wrong.&lt;/i&gt;

1573
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:19,920
&lt;i&gt; It's our hope&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt; that lets us survive.&lt;/i&gt;

1574
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:26,240
&lt;i&gt; That lets us bend,&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt; but remain unbroken.&lt;/i&gt;

1575
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:27,200
You two knew each other?

1576
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:28,480

&lt;i&gt; ? ?&lt;/i&gt;

1579
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:40,960
&lt;i&gt; It's our hope&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt; that makes us human.&lt;/i&gt;

1580
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:50,080
&lt;i&gt; ? I was born in a thunderstorm&lt;/i&gt;

1581
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:54,560
&lt;i&gt; ? I grew up overnight&lt;/i&gt;

1582
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:58,640
&lt;i&gt; ? I played alone&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt; I'm playing on my own&lt;/i&gt;

1583
01:41:58,680 --> 01:42:00,400
&lt;i&gt; ? I survived&lt;/i&gt;

1584
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:07,200
&lt;i&gt; ? Hey, I wanted everything&lt;/i&gt;   &lt;i&gt; I never had&lt;/i&gt;

1585
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:13,600
&lt;i&gt; ? Like the love&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt; that comes with light&lt;/i&gt;

1586
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:17,880
&lt;i&gt; ? I wore envy and I hated that But I survived&lt;/i&gt;

1587
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:26,280
&lt;i&gt; ? I had a one-way ticket&lt;/i&gt;   &lt;i&gt; to a place where&lt;/i&gt;   &lt;i&gt; all the demons go&lt;/i&gt;

1588
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:30,960
&lt;i&gt; ? Where the wind don't change&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt; and nothing in the ground&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt; can ever grow&lt;/i&gt;

1589
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:35,200
&lt;i&gt; ? No hope, just lies&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt; And you're taught to&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt; cry in your pillow&lt;/i&gt;

1590
01:42:35,240 --> 01:42:37,960
&lt;i&gt; ? But I'll survive&lt;/i&gt;

1591
01:42:39,680 --> 01:42:42,480
&lt;i&gt; ? I'm still breathing&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt; ? I'm still breathing&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt; I'm still breathing&lt;/i&gt;

1593
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:49,120
&lt;i&gt; ? I'm still breathing&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt; ? I'm alive&lt;/i&gt;

1595
01:42:53,560 --> 01:42:58,000
&lt;i&gt; ? I'm alive&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt; ? Way in the back of my mind&lt;/i&gt;

1600
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:21,680
&lt;i&gt; ? I saw my life&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;i&gt; in a stranger's face&lt;/i&gt;

1601
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:24,600
&lt;i&gt; ? And it was mine&lt;/i&gt;

1602

&lt;i&gt; ? I had a one-way ticket to a place where all the demons go&lt;/i&gt;
