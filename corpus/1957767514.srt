1
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:14,147
(soft music)

2
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:30,263
(engines roaring) (dramatic music)

3
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:00,487
(groaning)

4
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:10,797
- Are you kidding me?

5
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:20,373
Tim!

6
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,483
Come on.

7
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:37,524
Tim!

8
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:48,201
(creature roaring)

9
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:50,570
(soft music)

10
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,583
(dramatic music)

11
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:41,287
(engine revs)

12
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,742
(growling)

13
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:17,390
(man yelling)

14
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:22,328
(gentle music)

15
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:37,577
- Of course it's gonna work.

16
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,247
Well, the mayor and I happen to go way back.

17
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,684
Hey, when have I ever not come through for you, baby?

18
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:46,619
Besides...

19
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,688
And then too.

20
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:49,956
Look, this time it's different, Willie.

21
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,758
You and Erin just get the word out.

22
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,260
When it comes to Jimmy Green, my word is money, baby.

23
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,163
Trust me. (laughing)

24
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:58,698
- It's workin' fine, Mr. Mayor.

25
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:03,936
Jimmy.

26
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,471
John.

27
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,807
Oh, I mean, sheriff.

28
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,009
Wow.

29
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:11,611
Look at you.

30
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,180
Living the dream. (laughing)

31
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,316
- At least one of us is.

32
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:19,218
- How's your sister, Brenda?

33
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:20,620
- She carries a gun now.

34
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,323
I'm sure she'll be happy to see you.

35
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:26,125
- Ha. (clearing throat

36
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,628
(phone rings)

37
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,373
Mr. Mayor.

38
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,375
- James.

39
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,177
I'm a very busy man.

40
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,712
- I know.

41
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,380
You got the weight of the world on your shoulders,

42
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,816
or at least this town.

43
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:53,720
But have no fear, your savior is here.

44
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,254
- Ha, whose savior?

45
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:56,155
- Yours.

46
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:57,357
The island's.

47
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,225
- Oh, and what makes you think we need saving?

48
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,094
- I see it everywhere I look.

49
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,896
Businesses are closing, houses are for sale,

50
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:06,199
locals are moving to the mainland in search of work.

51
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:08,434
Poverty's up and happiness is down.

52
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:11,738
- Ugh, save me the speech, please.

53
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:15,241
- It's not a speech, it's a golden opportunity.

54
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:17,243
- Let's just cut to the chase, huh?

55
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:18,711
How much this time?

56
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:20,346
- What, money?

57
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:21,748
I don't need--

58
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:23,616
- How much?

59
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:24,584
- You know what?

60
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:26,586
Frankly, Pop, I'm insulted.

61
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,621
Your son, the fruit of your loins,

62
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:31,557
returns home to bring some life to the dying town

63
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:32,425
that raised him, and this--

64
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:33,760
- How much?

65
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,094
- Not much.

66
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:36,529
I got millions waiting on the nickel here,

67
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:37,864
which means millions for this island.

68
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,132
You'd be a hero.

69
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,633
And it is an election year, right, Pop?

70
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:41,868
Huh?

71
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,070
I've got a plan that will take White Sands

72
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,405
from the red back into the black,

73
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,141
just like it was before the attack.

74
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,110
- All right, son.

75
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,979
I'll bite.

76
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:54,547
- How many times have I told these guys

77
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:55,748
not to ride on the beach?

78
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,151
- A lot.

79
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,453
- And we haven't found the other body or bike?

80
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:06,793
And the other riders, they didn't hear or see anything?

81
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,294
- Nope.

82
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:09,629
- Because, jeez, I mean,

83
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,498
It looks like he was dragged in the sand

84
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:15,334
until his head finally just snapped off.

85
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,237
He had to have been screaming.

86
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:19,906
- But those engines are very loud.

87
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,174
- I know, why do you think I tell them

88
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:22,508
not to ride on the beach?

89
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:23,976
- Hey, look, don't bite my head off, okay?

90
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:25,578
I am just as upset as you are.

91
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,915
- No, I mean, we got to explore every angle

92
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,117
if we're gonna solve this murder.

93
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,752
- Murder?

94
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,287
That what you think this is?

95
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,088
- What else could it be?

96
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:38,090
- Well, I'll tell you what it looks like,

97
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,992
but you don't wanna hear it.

98
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:41,527
You don't wanna face the facts.

99
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:42,995
- Facts?

100
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:45,765
The fact is, this head and a those marks

101
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,201
are too far from the beach to be a shark attack.

102
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:51,137
- No, the tide could have washed it up.

103
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,339
Look, the line ends all the way up top there.

104
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:54,707
- No, no way.

105
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:55,875
Tim still had his helmet on.

106
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,610
Why would he be swimming with his helmet on?

107
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,512
- I don't know, maybe they were in the water.

108
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,113
They can do that nowadays with these dirt bikes.

109
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,281
They can ride them on the water.

110
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:03,182
- Did you ask the guys?

111
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:04,483
Is that what they told you?

112
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:05,852
- I asked them, but they said

113
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,020
that's not what they were doing.

114
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,689
- So how did he end up in the water

115
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:11,891
with his helmet on, okay?

116
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,893
Plus, look at the blood marks.

117
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:15,494
They line up with the head.

118
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:16,829
So the tide didn't do this.

119
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,064
He was dragged.

120
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:20,066
- Those lacerations look very similar to a bite.

121
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,702
Maybe we should call Dr. Powers.

122
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:26,038
- I'm not calling Dr. Powers because it wasn't a shark.

123
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:28,040
I mean, for all we know it could have been a coyote.

124
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,542
- A coyote?

125
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,711
There hasn't been a coyote on this island in 30 years.

126
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:34,714
- Look, I'm just saying if it was another animal,

127
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:36,482
what could have done it to this man?

128
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,151
Besides a shark.

129
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,223
Go look for the other dead bodies.

130
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:45,858
If you have to, comb the beaches.

131
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,426
- Shouldn't we comb the water?

132
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:48,261
- No.

133
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:49,195
Stay out of the water.

134
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:50,396
But the beach, they stay open.

135
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:53,065
- What? - Mayor's orders.

136
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:56,235
And speaking of sharks, Jimmy's back.

137
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,744
- You remember the old island festival, Pop?

138
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:05,945
- Please, son.

139
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,246
Is that what this is all about?

140
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:08,748
You wanna throw another party?

141
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:10,750
The community still hasn't recovered from the last one.

142
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,018
- I'm not just talking about a party

143
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,053
with a parade and some pony rides here, Pop.

144
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,688
Check it out.

145
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:17,857
I'm talking about an annual festival based

146
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:20,760
on radical self-expression and self-reliance.

147
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,728
A temporary community for spring-breakers

148
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,765
giving them exactly what they need: freedom

149
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,534
from their classes and midterms.

150
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,769
- And frat parties.

151
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,805
Oh, yeah, college is so oppressive these days.

152
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:34,440
Not that you would ever know.

153
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:39,712
Looks like one of those old kumbaya festivals.

154
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,647
(laughing) Yeah, I remember those days.

155
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:45,418
Bunch of hippies running around naked.

156
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:47,453
(inhaling) High on dope.

157
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:48,921
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

158
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,489
Listen, Pop, I'm not just talking

159
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:52,458
about a bunch of spring breakers running around taking

160
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,962
their tops off and drinking themselves into oblivion.

161
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,296
There's gonna be music too.

162
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:58,130
Huh?

163
00:09:58,164 --> 00:09:58,998
Huh, think about it.

164
00:09:58,998 --> 00:09:59,966
Think about it.

165
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:03,302
Daytona, Havasu, Burning Man.

166
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:06,138
All of these places survive on one week a year.

167
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:08,474
We can have our own cash cow right here.

168
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,176
The Sandman Festival.

169
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:12,912
Thousands of kids from all across America

170
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,313
will flock to this island

171
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:17,016
for some fun in the sun, and spend tons and tons

172
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,150
of their parents' money.

173
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,485
It will save the town.

174
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:21,687
You will be the mayor that saves this town.

175
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:25,758
You and me will be the family that saves this town.

176
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:29,595
- Did you practice that speech?

177
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:30,930
- A little, why, did it sound rehearsed?

178
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,264
- Not really.

179
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,132
- Ha!

180
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,301
- Sandman Festival, huh?

181
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,969
So there's a lot of gilt in this?

182
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:37,970
- Oh, big money.

183
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,872
Big money, from ticket sales

184
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:42,475
to camp site rentals, food, lodging.

185
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,877
If it can't be got, it can be bought.

186
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:45,878
We'll make a killing.

187
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:51,617
- Does this mean you're in? - Let's party, son.

188
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,952
I don't do that.

189
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,020
(speaks in foreign language)

190
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,454
That's my boy.

191
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,792
(dramatic music)

192
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:05,631
(cell phone buzzing)

193
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,336
- Pacific Marine Institute.

194
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:11,871
Hi, my name is Brenda Stone.

195
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:14,874
- I'm a deputy at the White Sands Island Sheriff Department.

196
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:18,210
Yeah, I'm hoping to speak to a Dr. Powers.

197
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:20,079
- This is she.

198
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:21,347
- I'm sorry, wrong person.

199
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,549
I'm looking for a Dr. Jacques Powers.

200
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:26,052
- He's not with us anymore.

201
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,487
- Did he finally retire?

202
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,223
He helped us with a shark attack a few years ago,

203
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:32,825
and I kind of got the feeling

204
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,561
he'd rather swim with the sharks than study them.

205
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,863
- Is there anything I can help you with?

206
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:40,666
You guys haven't had another shark attack, have you?

207
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:41,867
- Well, we're not sure.

208
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,036
We're hoping someone could come take a look.

209
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,204
- What's the name again?

210
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:48,908
(dramatic music)

211
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:12,364
- Okay.

212
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,600
You have successfully buried me in the sand.

213
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,535
Now how about you successfully un-bury me

214
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,403
from the sand?

215
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,605
- I'm sorry, I'm busy.

216
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:21,440
- No, you're not busy.

217
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,242
You're putting on suntan lotion.

218
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:24,443
- Oh, would you like some?

219
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:26,412
There you go.

220
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,313
- No!

221
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:28,981
(spitting) I don't want any.

222
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,884
I want you to un-bury me from the sand like I asked.

223
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:33,052
- Oh, relax.

224
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,487
- Relax?

225
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,555
Relax, you try to relax when you're buried neck-deep

226
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,090
in the sand.

227
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,925
Well, maybe next time you'll remember our anniversary.

228
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,427
- Oh, my...

229
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:44,830
I'm speechless.

230
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,232
I don't even know what to say,

231
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:48,501
because this is the most ridiculous thing

232
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:49,602
that has ever happened to me.

233
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:51,070
And as soon as you un-bury me,

234
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,738
I'm breaking...

235
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:53,772
That's great.

236
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,011
Whatever.

237
00:12:59,011 --> 00:12:59,945
I wanna break up.

238
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:04,517
(creature roaring) (screaming)

239
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:05,417
Cindy?

240
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:09,622
Cindy?

241
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,292
Ow.

242
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:14,160
Is that?

243
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,327
Ow.

244
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:16,929
Ow, ow.

245
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:17,796
Ow!

246
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:21,200
(screaming)

247
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,306
(soft music)

248
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,050
- [Announcer] Attention all passengers, now boarding

249
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,552
from Cedar Bay.

250
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:42,821
Please present your boarding pass to the ticker counter.

251
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:43,689
Thank you. - White Sands,

252
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:44,790
is that one word or two?

253
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:47,226
Eh, whatever.

254
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:49,862
Okay.

255
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,664
Just sent out the bait on Biter.

256
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,132
In a few minutes every college kid

257
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,534
in this country is gonna have a bite on Sandman.

258
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,069
- Got to love social networking.

259
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,573
- Yes Mr. Baggio, I will make sure that Mr. Green's

260
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:03,576
party lives up to your expectations.

261
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:04,577
Okay, goodbye.

262
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,679
- Excuse me.

263
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:08,581
You must be Jimmy's lawyer.

264
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,916
He told us to wait; we'd meet one sharp lady.

265
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:15,421
Actually, he said sharp-tongued devil lady.

266
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:18,991
(laughing) I'm sure he was just kidding.

267
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,226
So, I'm Willie.

268
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,994
I do all the cyber marketing for Jimmy.

269
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,196
And this is Erin, our intern.

270
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,364
- Hey, hey.

271
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:30,002
(golf cart humming) (playful music)

272
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:36,108
- Welcome to my island.

273
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,344
(sighing)

274
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,213
How was the flight?

275
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:42,081
- Fly.

276
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:43,015
Thanks for the chariot.

277
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,550
- My first heli-thingy ride.

278
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,285
It was hella cool.

279
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:47,720
- I'd like to take credit for it, but--

280
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:48,687
- He can't.

281
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:49,855
His investor paid for it.

282
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,192
- Nice to see you too, Amanda.

283
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,361
Tony D-Bag send you here to check up on me?

284
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,062
- Mr. Baggio just wanted to make sure you didn't

285
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,964
bite off more than you can chew again.

286
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:01,567
- Well, let's go see the beach and you can judge

287
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,269
for yourself, shall we?

288
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:06,772
Hey, where's Sparky and the boys?

289
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:08,307
- They took a boat thingy.

290
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:09,275
- Yeah, there wasn't enough room

291
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:10,442
for all this fireworks.

292
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,077
Said this vessel will give me the bomb.

293
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:16,382
- Yeah, I know all about his military-grade explosives.

294
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:19,118
He wanted to call this festival Sand-pocalypse Now.

295
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:20,886
- Um, Mr. Green?

296
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:25,457
- Just jump in the bed, it's safe.

297
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:26,425
- Oh, yeah.

298
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,460
I've heard that one before.

299
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,963
- [Announcer] Attention all passengers, Flight 14,

300
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,998
your bags are now available--

301
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,567
(engine revs)

302
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,435
- Hey!

303
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,009
(ominous music)

304
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:00,326
(banging)

305
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:01,160
- Jeez!

306
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,496
(panting)

307
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:07,099
You nearly scared me to death.

308
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,467
- I thought you would have caught me,

309
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,003
being that you're on shark watch.

310
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:12,204
- Oh.

311
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:14,373
Guess I just got lost in the water.

312
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:16,642
- Any activity? - No.

313
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:18,277
It's dead.

314
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,846
- Well, I guess that's a bit of a relief, isn't it?

315
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,181
John?

316
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:24,049
(screaming)

317
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:24,950
John, what?

318
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,361
(laughing)

319
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:36,195
- Stop.

320
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:54,146
- So, we'll set up the main stage right here.

321
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,716
We're gonna have some beer and food tents off to the side.

322
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:00,386
Nice little VIP lounge area in the back.

323
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,221
- Wait, we having actual stages?

324
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:03,489
- Not really.

325
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,757
No, I wanna all be on the ground.

326
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:06,492
You know, have the DJ spinning at eye level.

327
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,595
Make it feel like one giant beach blanket bingo party.

328
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:11,096
- Who were you thinking for DJs?

329
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:12,031
- The usual.

330
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,399
Killer Carl, Dead Horse.

331
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:14,733
Start things off with DJ Plan B.

332
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:15,667
And if any of them say they can't make it,

333
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,035
you tell them they owe me.

334
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,270
- Okay.

335
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,506
- That's ironic: you collecting on a debt.

336
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,742
- What's ironic, Amanda, is you not being a witch.

337
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:25,911
Actually, that would be a miracle. (laughing)

338
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:27,880
- Stop trying to flirt with me, James.

339
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:29,081
I'm out of your league.

340
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,282
- You only think you're out of my league.

341
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:32,885
And you tell Tony that Jimmy Green always pays.

342
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:34,086
My word is money, baby.

343
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:35,254
Money. - Money.

344
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:36,955
- It better be, otherwise your name

345
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:38,390
is gonna be on a tombstone.

346
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:41,393
(clearing throat)

347
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,128
- So, what about, like, housing?

348
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:44,596
- Yeah, housing.

349
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,765
There is a campground just down the beach a ways

350
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,300
for everybody to put their RVs,

351
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:49,868
their tents, whatever.

352
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:53,572
- You expect thousands of college kids to sleep in tents?

353
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,941
- I know for you, Amanda, sleeping in a three-star hotel

354
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:57,276
is roughing it.

355
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,778
- Try four-star. - But to a college student,

356
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,880
sleeping on a couch is a luxury.

357
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,048
Besides, it's spring break.

358
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:04,950
It's Sandman Festival.

359
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,985
If they're sleeping they ain't spending.

360
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:08,220
- Yup!

361
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,556
- Who needs beds when you have booze,

362
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:12,324
beach bodies and bands?

363
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:14,593
(laughing)

364
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:19,264
- And she is why I will never have kids.

365
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:22,968
- Spring break is off the hook! (laughing)

366
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:24,937
- No, I don't do that.

367
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:25,804
- Oh.

368
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:28,474
(playful music)

369
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:41,820
(camera shutter clicking)

370
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:43,689
- Oh-ho!

371
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:46,959
Nice hat.

372
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,360
Is that part of the uniform?

373
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:54,500
- Jimmy.

374
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:55,367
- Brenda.

375
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:57,636
Long time no see.

376
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:58,637
- Yeah.

377
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,305
Last time I saw you,

378
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,107
oh, that's right, I never saw you.

379
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:03,675
You just left me with an eviction notice,

380
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:05,644
two grand in bills and your stupid cat.

381
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:09,014
- At least I left you with something.

382
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:12,518
- You have some nerve coming back here, Jimmy Greenburg.

383
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:13,385
- Greenburg?

384
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:14,953
- It's Green now.

385
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,055
- I heard, as in envy?

386
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:18,157
- As in money.

387
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,525
- Right.

388
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,527
Isn't that ironic, considering you never have any.

389
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,061
- That's exactly what I said.

390
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,064
- I'm sorry, who are you?

391
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:27,166
- This is Amanda Gore.

392
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,800
She happens to be my lawyer.

393
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,969
- Actually, I represent James' financiers,

394
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,738
among other things.

395
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,909
- So, why has the prodigal son returned?

396
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,378
- Oh, I just had an idea how to help the island.

397
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,347
- Oh, doing what, exactly?

398
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,683
- Just something to help out local businesses.

399
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:48,053
- Oh, we're throwing a major rager for spring break.

400
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:49,555
It's called the Sandman Festival.

401
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,523
It's gonna be epic.

402
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:01,600
- Festival?

403
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:04,336
Jimmy, you're organizing another festival?

404
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:05,604
- It's not really a festival,

405
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:06,772
more like a party.

406
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:08,574
Kind of a small get-together, really.

407
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:11,777
- After what the people of this island have gone through,

408
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:13,345
you're throwing another party?

409
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:15,747
- Look, I am gonna put White Sands back on the map.

410
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,382
- You're the reason we're off the map, Jimmy.

411
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,285
15 people died the last time you threw

412
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:21,420
this island a party.

413
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:24,523
(roaring) (screaming)

414
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,724
- Help!

415
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:27,192
Somebody help!

416
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:28,026
Something happened to my boyfriend!

417
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:29,261
It came out of the sand.

418
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:33,198
(dramatic music)

419
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,372
Come on!

420
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:46,912
I saw it!

421
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,113
Something ate my boyfriend!

422
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:50,115
There is something, a shark swimming

423
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:51,416
in the sand.

424
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,751
- Miss, sharks can't swim in the sand!

425
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:53,585
- I saw it!

426
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:55,621
- She must be talking about shallow water

427
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:56,655
or somethin', right?

428
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:58,790
- John, come on.

429
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,591
Wake up!

430
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:01,426
- Ooh.

431
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:04,296
- That's gonna be bad for business.

432
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:16,341
(voices chattering)

433
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,311
- That's all, we wanna know-- - The same answers.

434
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:21,146
The same thing every year.

435
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:22,414
Blah, blah, blah! - We understand that.

436
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:26,284
We understand! - Everybody, please calm down.

437
00:21:26,284 --> 00:21:27,452
- Hello!

438
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,420
- [Mayor] One at a time,

439
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,489
one at a time. (whistling)

440
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:31,690
- There's a killer in the water

441
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,258
and you're telling us to calm down?

442
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:35,527
- Tim Cassidy was killed the day before,

443
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:36,828
and you didn't warn anyone?

444
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:38,597
- Now, hold on, Peter.

445
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,433
We don't know that Tim Cassidy was attacked.

446
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:45,170
Why, what I mean to say is we still haven't

447
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,171
found the body.

448
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:47,806
Right, John?

449
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:51,043
- Yes, Mr. Mayor, but-- - Excuse me, John.

450
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:52,878
You of all people should be freaked.

451
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:56,114
You lost your wife and child to a shark attack.

452
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,884
- Hey, now, we're not saying it was a shark attack.

453
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:00,018
- What else could it have been?

454
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:01,653
- Look, we have an expert coming

455
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:03,121
from the mainland, Dr. Powers.

456
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:05,457
He helped us last time.

457
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,325
He'll know what to do.

458
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:08,560
- What about the bounty?

459
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,961
Is that true?

460
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,830
- Yes, I guess you talked--

461
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,166
- Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.

462
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:16,301
You bring us the head, you'll get the bread guaranteed.

463
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:18,470
- Listen, listen guys, we can't have you running

464
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,839
around town with guns chasing after some fish.

465
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:23,508
I'm sorry, sir, we don't even know where it came from.

466
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,577
- I heard it came from the sand.

467
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:26,745
- No, Bob.

468
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:29,214
I'm sure it was just a shark swimming

469
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:30,248
in shallow water.

470
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,051
But until the experts take a look at it,

471
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:35,253
the beaches, they stay closed.

472
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,355
- What? - You're closing the beaches?

473
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:38,390
For how long?

474
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,025
- Just until.

475
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:42,761
Listen, listen! - Everyone calm down.

476
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:45,931
- Just until we find out what it is and we can stop it.

477
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:47,265
- How long, exactly?

478
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:50,869
I own a business, and it's hurting.

479
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:53,438
Another bad season, I'm gonna have to move.

480
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:55,340
- Closing the beaches will kill us all.

481
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,844
- What the sheriff means to say

482
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:02,614
is that the beaches will be closed for 24 hours only.

483
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:03,915
- Hey, wait a minute.

484
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:05,751
I got a deadline here!

485
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:09,287
- 24 hours only, that's it!

486
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:11,289
- [Man] I'll catch your sand sharks.

487
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:12,891
- Excuse me?

488
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:16,261
- I said, I'll catch it for youse.

489
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:18,096
And it's a sand shark.

490
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:20,866
- I've never seen a sand shark that big.

491
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:24,236
- (laughing) That's because you got your eyes up your ass.

492
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,305
It's big 'cause it ain't a sand shark.

493
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:29,574
It's a sand shark.

494
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:32,444
It swims in the sand.

495
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:34,746
- They don't exist.

496
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,314
- Ha!

497
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:37,716
Says you.

498
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,584
I've seen 'em.

499
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:44,589
Now, you want it caught or not?

500
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:47,459
- Well, of course we do, Angus.

501
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,763
- Okay, I'll catch it meself.

502
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:55,901
But I ain't doing it for no thousand bucks.

503
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:57,736
I'll do it for 10 grand.

504
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:03,608
For that, I'll bring you the head, good and dead.

505
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:04,743
Yeah?

506
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:08,914
And then you get to have your fruity festival.

507
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:11,783
And your businesses will survive.

508
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:12,818
Tourists will come.

509
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:15,153
No one gets hurt.

510
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:18,356
- Well, thank you, Angus.

511
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:19,858
We'll certainly consider it.

512
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,297
- You know where to find me.

513
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,168
- Okay.

514
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:31,336
- All right, this meeting's adjourned.

515
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:32,304
Everybody out of here. - What?

516
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:33,505
No, wait minute.

517
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:34,840
- Thank you all.

518
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:37,776
- [John] Let's go, guys, come on.

519
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:38,877
Let's get out of here.

520
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:57,662
- Sheriff Stone?

521
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:01,900
(soft music)

522
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,335
- [John] So, how are we looking?

523
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:08,506
The bite marks on the neck match the ones on the legs.

524
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,574
It's the same animal.

525
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:11,710
- Is it a shark?

526
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,311
- I can't be sure.

527
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:15,013
I'd have to run some more tests,

528
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:16,815
see if there's any other DNA.

529
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:22,487
- I noticed you had a firearm, Dr. Powers.

530
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,423
- Well, you know, there's a lot of sharks

531
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:26,358
out there, sheriff.

532
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:28,393
A girl can't be too careful.

533
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:30,595
And it's Sandy, please.

534
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,332
- Well, Sandy, call me John.

535
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,102
(dramatic music)

536
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:50,715
- Hey, Earl, you sure that thing comes out at night?

537
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:51,750
- Damn sure, man.

538
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,118
All the attacks been at night.

539
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:54,686
But we will have to be patient.

540
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:03,562
Hey, you see that?

541
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,201
No!

542
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,770
(roaring)

543
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,706
(dramatic music)

544
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,741
It's the shark, oh.

545
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:21,780
- Oh, crap! (both screaming)

546
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:24,249
We're on land.

547
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:25,383
It can't get us now.

548
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:26,451
- Earl! - What?

549
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:27,786
- It's coming again! - Oh, God!

550
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:30,155
(screaming)

551
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:41,666
- (sighs) Well, that's Earl Jones' raft.

552
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:45,136
Hm.

553
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:46,338
Can you guys lift for me?

554
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:52,644
(flies buzzing) - Ew.

555
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:53,478
- Oh.

556
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:57,449
- Yeah. - Ugh.

557
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:00,652
All right, guys.

558
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:01,786
You can bring it down thanks.

559
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:06,658
- Seems like they would have been better off in the boat.

560
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:09,761
You know, judging by the position of the raft,

561
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:13,465
this far up the beach, they weren't attacked in the water.

562
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,134
- Oh.

563
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:17,102
- Hey!

564
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:18,770
Got a party to plan here!

565
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,138
- Oh, I got to go deal with that.

566
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:21,306
Are you okay down here?

567
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,807
- Yeah.

568
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:25,143
I'm gonna play in the sand and see what I can dig up.

569
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,478
- Okay.

570
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:27,345
Thanks, guys.

571
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:32,017
- Ooh.

572
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,818
I love a woman in uniform.

573
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:35,553
- Ugh, Jimmy, I'm not in the mood.

574
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:36,855
- You're not in the mood, what about me?

575
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:38,056
I have an entire festival to set up,

576
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:39,491
and your brother won't let us on the beach.

577
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:41,292
- That's because it's closed for 24 hours.

578
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:42,794
You were there.

579
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:45,530
- Well, it may be closed to the public, but not me.

580
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:48,867
I have reserved this beach for a private event.

581
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,402
- Regardless, you're not getting on this beach.

582
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:52,137
until John says it's safe.

583
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,638
- Ah.

584
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:55,840
Still can't jump until your brother says

585
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:57,642
how high, huh?

586
00:27:57,642 --> 00:28:01,679
Well, according to this contract

587
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:04,983
signed by my father,

588
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:06,418
the distinguished mayor

589
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:09,587
of White Sands, I have full access to use this beach

590
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:12,857
whenever and however I choose.

591
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:15,193
- Raoul Jones and Ray Parker's arms

592
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:18,029
were just found in the sand minus their bodies.

593
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,565
So, I don't care if God himself signed

594
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:22,734
that paper, everyone is waiting 24 hours,

595
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:24,869
or at least until we catch whatever fish

596
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:27,872
is eating people on this beach.

597
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:31,509
Until then, your party isn't on the sand.

598
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:32,510
It's on the ice.

599
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:44,556
- Hello, doctor.

600
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,725
Of what, I have no idea.

601
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:49,627
- So, what's the plan?

602
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:53,031
- Well, we just go ahead as planned.

603
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:58,236
Just keep the marketing machine running.

604
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:02,474
I have a very special hands-on job for you.

605
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:04,742
- I told you I wasn't gonna do that again.

606
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:07,445
- Relax, I said hands-on job,

607
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:09,314
not hand, never mind.

608
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,583
- All right, but what about the beach being closed?

609
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:13,284
With a shark out there, no way are people

610
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:14,953
gonna come to the beach.

611
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:17,122
- You just leave the shark to big daddy.

612
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,093
Hey, it's Jimmy.

613
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:24,596
Your brother still doing those lame shark movies?

614
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:30,502
- I got the stuff you asked for.

615
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,004
- Thanks.

616
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:34,339
- So is there anything new?

617
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:36,741
- Actually, yes.

618
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:40,011
Take a look at this bad boy.

619
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:41,012
- [John] Wow.

620
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,313
Looks like a shark tooth.

621
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:45,316
It is, but I'm not sure what kind.

622
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:48,086
- This thing really puzzles me.

623
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,754
Take a look at this.

624
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:51,756
See the gum line?

625
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:53,124
It's really soft.

626
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,959
And the tooth is underdeveloped.

627
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:56,261
It looks like a baby tooth,

628
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:59,664
but it's bigger than any adult great white shark

629
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:00,965
tooth I've ever seen.

630
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:02,367
- Well, is it a great white?

631
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:07,005
It looks more like a sand tiger shark, but...

632
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:09,374
- Well, then it's a tiger shark.

633
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,009
- It's similar in shape and density,

634
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:13,278
but see the striations right here?

635
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,512
- [John] Yeah.

636
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:16,514
See how the tip has a jagged edge, like a saw?

637
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:17,982
- Mm-hmm.

638
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:20,685
- Well, I've only seen one other tooth like that.

639
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:22,520
And it was a tooth that my dad brought back

640
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,990
from Joshua Tree, of a prehistoric sand tiger shark.

641
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,626
The Striatolamia macrota.

642
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:30,662
- So are you saying this is a dino shark?

643
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:34,199
- Um, I can't be sure.

644
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,633
I'd have to run other tests.

645
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,469
You know, carbon dating, DNA, stuff like that.

646
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:44,342
So don't go getting all Roger Corman on me yet.

647
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:45,176
- Who?

648
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:49,214
- Obviously you're not a B-movie fan.

649
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:50,582
- Nope.

650
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:52,684
- [Brenda] Brenda for John?

651
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:53,985
- Yeah, Brenda.

652
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:55,486
- I need you to come down here real quick.

653
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:57,155
They caught another one.

654
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,857
- Caught one what? - Another shark, and it's big.

655
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,761
(dramatic music)

656
00:31:15,873 --> 00:31:18,776
- Okay, who killed the shark?

657
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:19,611
Huh?

658
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:20,845
Was it Banlinder?

659
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,547
Did Mike Banlinder kill this shark?

660
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:25,283
- I think this is the shark killer over here, Pop.

661
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,452
- Oh, you sir, (speaks in foreign language).

662
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,788
So we all have you to thank for this?

663
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:32,023
- That's right.

664
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,625
Me and my crew snapped this little guppy up

665
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:34,959
like a bird in a disco.

666
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:36,527
- (laughing) Aces.

667
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,695
Just aces.

668
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:39,397
Fantastic work!

669
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,466
- I hate to bust up your party, boys,

670
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:43,768
but would you mind if we take a look at this fish?

671
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:45,069
- What's there to look at?

672
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:46,271
It's a shark, it's dead; let's open up the beach

673
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:47,572
and party, huh?

674
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:49,307
- I just wanna make sure it's the shark

675
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:50,942
we're looking for, Jimmy.

676
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:53,711
- This guy obviously has nothing to hide.

677
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,246
I mean, look at him.

678
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,916
- Sheriff, I am certain this has got to be the right shark.

679
00:31:58,916 --> 00:32:00,618
- Oh, well, if he's sure then we should

680
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:01,619
definitely have a look.

681
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,154
- Hey, hey, hey!

682
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:04,222
Get away from there.

683
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:08,593
- Mr. Mayor, I would like you to meet Dr. Sandy Powers.

684
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:12,063
She's from the Pacific Marine Institute on the mainland.

685
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:14,265
She'll be able to tell us if this is our shark.

686
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:20,805
- Relax, it's loaded.

687
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:21,639
- Excuse me?

688
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:23,241
- The shark.

689
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,108
It's loaded.

690
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,310
It's real.

691
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,478
There was an actor in Shark Attack 3D.

692
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:28,513
Died while filming.

693
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:29,914
Ate one of the other actors,

694
00:32:29,947 --> 00:32:31,983
so they had to pop it.

695
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:33,651
(both laughing)

696
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:35,586
- Bites for them, good for us, huh?

697
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,988
- [Mike] Giddyup.

698
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:40,024
- It's not what we're looking for.

699
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:40,925
- Oh, come on.

700
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:42,427
What is this, a joke?

701
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:46,698
Hey, Pop, John is obviously trying to stop the festival.

702
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:48,032
But he caught a shark.

703
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:50,001
- Yeah, but it's not the shark.

704
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:54,172
- Miss, are you positive?

705
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:55,540
- Dead positive.

706
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,475
The teeth are too small on this one.

707
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:59,711
This is an adult, and I believe that the tooth

708
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:01,512
that we have is from a baby.

709
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:04,048
Besides, the shark's been dead a week.

710
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:05,783
I doubt these men even caught it.

711
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,055
- Beaches stay closed.

712
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:13,191
Get this fish out of here.

713
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:21,299
- Does this mean I don't get my bounty?

714
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:24,168
You just get your crew together and start setting up

715
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,002
for the festival.

716
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:25,903
I'll handle it.

717
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:31,809
(dramatic music)

718
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,355
- Hey, got plans for spring break?

719
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,357
Come to the Sandman Festival.

720
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,525
Hey, come to the Sandman Festival.

721
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:48,726
It's gonna be great.

722
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:51,829
(cell phone ringing)

723
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:58,069
Hey, Mr. Green.

724
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:00,104
- Erin, baby.

725
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:01,072
Talk to me.

726
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:02,840
How's it going out there?

727
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:03,775
- Lame-o.

728
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:05,710
Nobody's taking these fliers.

729
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:08,045
- Do they know that it's a music festival?

730
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:10,047
- Yes, but-- - And have you told them

731
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:11,582
there's gonna be tonnes of beer?

732
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:12,917
Yes, but-

733
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,619
- Where are you?

734
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:16,621
- The beach by the boardwalk.

735
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:17,789
- The beach?

736
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:20,191
Oh, hell no, Erin.

737
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,560
Baby, sweetheart, no, no, no.

738
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,395
People at the beach, they don't wanna party.

739
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:25,930
They don't wanna be bothered.

740
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:29,434
You need to find a bar and buy some bad decisions.

741
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:31,102
- But I'm only an intern.

742
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:32,437
I don't have any money.

743
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,239
- Ooh.

744
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:36,107
Uh, just...

745
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:39,277
Put it on your card.

746
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:40,111
I'll pay you back.

747
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:44,882
- Hm.

748
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:45,716
Yeah, you will.

749
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:54,058
Bloodies for everybody!

750
00:34:54,091 --> 00:34:56,561
(all cheering)

751
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:59,931
(upbeat music)

752
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:01,666
- I don't know what that girl would do without me.

753
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,301
She'd get eaten alive in the real world.

754
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:05,570
How's promoting in cyberspace, huh?

755
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:08,106
- Oh, man, we got Tweets and creeps,

756
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:10,308
bites and bulletins all over the Web, man.

757
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:12,343
I'm telling you, we are on campus,

758
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,479
on your wall and on your phone.

759
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:17,315
I got space on lockdown, son.

760
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:18,816
- Right on, dawg.

761
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:23,154
- Well, actually, Erin created this program that triples

762
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:25,923
the hits on every blog and college website in the country.

763
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,192
So, she's your chick.

764
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:29,093
- Really?

765
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,428
She can do that, huh?

766
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:32,263
- Yeah, she's smarter than she looks.

767
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,131
- Wow.

768
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:36,501
I would have never guessed she was such a shark.

769
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:37,668
Better watch out.

770
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:38,536
She might come biting for your job.

771
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:39,770
- What?

772
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,005
Never happen.

773
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:42,840
I'm still the big fish in this pond.

774
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,008
Check it.

775
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:45,877
I'm even too big for this island's internet.

776
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:47,278
I already crashed it twice.

777
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,882
- Hey, hey, hey.

778
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:51,949
- See what I mean?

779
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,354
I'm just saying, I'm that good.

780
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:57,788
- Don't ever do that again.

781
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,123
- Okay, all right, all right.

782
00:35:59,123 --> 00:35:59,991
I won't.

783
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:02,527
(gentle music)

784
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:10,334
(growling)

785
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,669
(electricity crackling)

786
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,171
No.

787
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:14,839
This isn't happening now.

788
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,340
(breathing heavily)

789
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,342
Tell me this did not just happen.

790
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,044
We did not just lose every feed!

791
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:20,878
No!

792
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:27,818
Hey.

793
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:28,886
You looking for Jimmy?

794
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:29,720
- Yeah.

795
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,721
You? - Yeah.

796
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,392
- Jimmy, I am wet and...

797
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:36,260
Hi, deputy.

798
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:37,762
- Hmm, ma'am.

799
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:41,499
- Looks like someone's Mr. Popular.

800
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,367
Just so you two know, I get him first.

801
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,235
- What's up?

802
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:47,572
Hello.

803
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:49,774
(sighing)

804
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:52,276
Hello.

805
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:56,080
Uh, is anybody else's power out?

806
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:01,185
(siren blaring)

807
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:06,090
Look, I understand why the back seat.

808
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:08,025
You don't wanna sit next to me, fine.

809
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,796
But are the handcuffs really necessary?

810
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:14,365
- Yup. (Jimmy sighs)

811
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:23,374
- So wanna tell me what's going on?

812
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:24,742
Where we're headed?

813
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:25,576
- Nope.

814
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:34,385
- You know, I said I was sorry.

815
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,753
I never meant to hurt you.

816
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:37,488
- Well, you didn't.

817
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:38,322
Happy?

818
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:41,826
- Not really.

819
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:42,660
No.

820
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:47,732
I was hoping an apology might get these off my wrists.

821
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:48,733
Ow!

822
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:51,102
- It's always about you, still.

823
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:53,604
(sighing)

824
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,240
So, why did you really come back here?

825
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,242
- Like I said, I wanna put on a festival

826
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,310
and help White Sands.

827
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:02,413
- That's it?

828
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:03,614
You came back here to help the home

829
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:05,916
that you couldn't wait to get away from?

830
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:07,084
- Yeah, that's about it.

831
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:10,354
That, and I'm gonna make some nice green out of it.

832
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:13,858
(laughing) But other than that,

833
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:15,426
what else is there here for me?

834
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:18,029
- Apparently nothing.

835
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:21,165
- What's going on over there?

836
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:22,199
- I recognize you.

837
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:23,534
I recognize who you are.

838
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:25,002
- You need to relax, dude-- - No, no, no.

839
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:26,370
You were there earlier.

840
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:28,439
You were there earlier with a guy named Jimmy.

841
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,675
You just, you just stay put.

842
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:36,113
- Those are your buddies, right?

843
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:37,381
- Sheriff. - What?

844
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:39,216
- Is that really necessary? - Yes, it is.

845
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:43,621
- Do you even know how to use that thing?

846
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:44,455
- Yes, I do.

847
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:54,565
- Thank God your mother's not here to see this.

848
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:57,234
Why is he in cuffs? (grunting)

849
00:38:57,234 --> 00:38:59,370
- He is a ringleader of this crew of criminals.

850
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,538
- Criminals?

851
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:03,074
Buddy, if you'd just let me fix the problem--

852
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,475
- That's enough out of you.

853
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:08,245
- Yeah, if you would let him get the power on,

854
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:09,547
John, maybe it would shed a little light

855
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:10,915
on whatever your problem is.

856
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:12,717
- Oh, so you do know all these men?

857
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:15,653
- As a matter of fact, I do.

858
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:16,921
They work for me.

859
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:18,255
- Wait, these men all work for you?

860
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:19,924
- Yes.

861
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:21,192
- Impressive.

862
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:22,560
- Impressive?

863
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,229
No, not impressive, Mr. Mayor.

864
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:27,598
These are the same men that thought it'd

865
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:30,401
be funny to slip in a fake shark,

866
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:33,404
and then turn the power off of this entire island.

867
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:36,073
- Look, it's just a fuse problem.

868
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:38,042
- That's enough out of you, light bulb.

869
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:42,012
(dramatic music)

870
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:09,039
- Would you take off the cuffs, please?

871
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:09,940
Is all this true?

872
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:13,911
- As a matter of fact, Dad, it is, and, ow!

873
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:15,312
Ow!

874
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:17,815
We have an entire festival to get set up, ah,

875
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:20,818
by tomorrow, and we're already running behind.

876
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:23,487
(ominous music)

877
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:29,059
If he would just let Sparky get the power on then--

878
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:31,162
- Sparky can just stay cool, okay?

879
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:32,730
You keep breaking the law and doing

880
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:35,232
your little sneaky stuff, and the power will

881
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:37,268
not be the only thing that goes down.

882
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:38,269
- You see, Pop?

883
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,670
He's threatening me again.

884
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:42,139
He's been trying to stop Sandman from the very beginning.

885
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:48,846
(breathing heavily)

886
00:40:50,314 --> 00:40:53,284
(creature growling)

887
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:03,594
- All right, enough of this waiting

888
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:05,796
for divine intervention garbage.

889
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,264
- Look, I told you to stay put.

890
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:09,166
- Look, buddy, you can't insult me

891
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:11,101
and then not let me fix the problem.

892
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,604
- Look, you just freeze right there.

893
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:14,972
- You wanna shoot me?

894
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:16,173
Then do it.

895
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:18,142
Otherwise, prepare for fireworks.

896
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:19,009
- I'm warning you.

897
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:20,177
I'm warning you, freeze.

898
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:22,613
You guys stay here.

899
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:24,181
- [Sparky] Lights up, baby!

900
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,999
(growling)

901
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:46,370
- Sandy!

902
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,204
Sandy!

903
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:48,172
- Dr. Powers!

904
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,678
- John, stay there.

905
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:55,513
It's in the sand.

906
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,513
It's circling.

907
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:08,726
- Did you see that?

908
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:10,060
- John, don't!

909
00:42:12,229 --> 00:42:14,565
(gun fires)

910
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:20,604
- Come on, come on.

911
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:26,877
- Oh, my God.

912
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:27,945
Oh, my God.

913
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:29,280
- What the hell was that?

914
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,615
- Did you see that thing?

915
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:33,751
It moved through the sand like it was water.

916
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:37,588
- I've never seen a fish swim in sand. (pants)

917
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:40,958
I hate to say it, but I think the old man was right.

918
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:42,793
That's an actual sand shark.

919
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:45,062
- We are keeping these beaches closed

920
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:46,063
until that thing is killed.

921
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:46,931
- Agreed.

922
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:48,132
Sorry, son.

923
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:49,533
- Pop, you promised me.

924
00:42:49,566 --> 00:42:52,403
- And I also promised that the residents

925
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,538
and visitors of White Sand I'd protect 'em.

926
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:57,541
(speaks in foreign language), as much as I do truly believe

927
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:58,809
that your party would help everybody

928
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:01,145
on this island, what kind of leader would

929
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:03,080
I be if I allowed this event to go on knowing

930
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:06,617
that there's some kind of monster out there.

931
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,320
- No.

932
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,456
It is our civic duty to close this beach.

933
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:14,058
I'm drawing a line in the sand.

934
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:18,228
You mark my words: I will not rest

935
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:20,331
until this beast is--

936
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:22,099
(growling)

937
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:24,435
- Mr. Mayor! - Hey, Pop!

938
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,602
Oh!

939
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:27,738
- Oh, my God, Jimmy.

940
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:29,139
- My dad!

941
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:32,076
- I know. - It went, it ate him!

942
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,277
And he's gone!

943
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,981
Oh! - My God.

944
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:37,948
Oh, my God.

945
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:44,088
(stammering)

946
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:46,023
- I just got to plug it in!

947
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:48,125
- Sparky! - Get off the beach!

948
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:49,326
- Sparky!

949
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:50,828
- Sparky, get off the beach!

950
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:51,862
- Come on!

951
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:53,297
I can help! (gun fires)

952
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:54,431
- No, you can't! - I can save him!

953
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:56,000
Shoot that thing!

954
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,634
Sparky!

955
00:43:57,668 --> 00:43:59,636
- Sparky, off the beach!

956
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:03,207
- Sparky! - It's all right.

957
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:04,541
Jeez.

958
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:05,376
Relax.

959
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:06,710
- Sparky!

960
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:08,645
- Sparky, get off the beach!

961
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,982
- Here goes nothing. - Sparky!

962
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,653
- Sparky, get off the beach! - Can't have fire

963
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:16,820
without a Sparky.

964
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:20,958
(electricity crackling)

965
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:21,792
- Oh!

966
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:37,207
(car horns honking)

967
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,078
(gentle music)

968
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:54,825
(grunting)

969
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:05,069
- Are you checking up on me?

970
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:05,869
- Kind of.

971
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:09,206
I came to tell you the beach is open, but...

972
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:13,777
Looks like you already know that.

973
00:45:15,245 --> 00:45:17,915
- Yeah, well, you know, now that the sand shark's dead,

974
00:45:17,948 --> 00:45:20,784
I figure the show must go on.

975
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:22,786
- Same old Jimmy.

976
00:45:22,786 --> 00:45:24,221
Always turning the page.

977
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:25,689
- Look, I know it sucks.

978
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:28,292
But it's what my dad would have wanted.

979
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:32,463
"James, put on a brave face.

980
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:33,964
"It's business as usual."

981
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,601
That was a little bit more of a bad Sean Connery

982
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:39,269
than my dad, but you get the point.

983
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:41,138
Besides, he always loved a good party.

984
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:44,942
I've decided I'm gonna do this in his honor.

985
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,578
- He would have liked that.

986
00:45:48,612 --> 00:45:49,446
- Yeah.

987
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:51,281
Yeah.

988
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:56,086
(grunting)

989
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:01,492
- Hey, Jimmy, break a leg tonight.

990
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:04,828
I hope this works out for you and for the island.

991
00:46:04,828 --> 00:46:05,996
- Yeah.

992
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:09,767
Oh, speaking of that, I got a guy coming

993
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,802
from the mainland to fix the electricity.

994
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:15,272
So let John know the power will be on soon, okay?

995
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:17,574
I will, thanks for doing that.

996
00:46:17,574 --> 00:46:19,076
- Yeah, you bet.

997
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:21,278
(grunting)

998
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:32,456
(sighing) Brenda.

999
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,995
You know how to get down to the beach from here?

1000
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:41,765
- Yeah, it's that way.

1001
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,034
- Great.

1002
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:45,102
Got it.

1003
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:47,704
(grunts) Okay.

1004
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:51,608
(grunting)

1005
00:46:55,045 --> 00:46:55,879
Hey. - Hey.

1006
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,550
- [Jimmy] Oh, ow, ow!

1007
00:47:01,518 --> 00:47:03,187
- Do you need help

1008
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:04,221
Are you okay? - No, no.

1009
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:05,556
I got it, I got it.

1010
00:47:07,024 --> 00:47:08,792
- You look like you got it. - Ooh.

1011
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:12,696
(exhaling)

1012
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:15,399
(ominous music)

1013
00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:26,176
- The main power is still out.

1014
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:27,377
What are you working on?

1015
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:32,216
- (sighing) Okay, so, remember how I said

1016
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:34,918
I wasn't sure but I thought that the tooth

1017
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:36,587
might be a baby tooth?

1018
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:38,055
- Yeah.

1019
00:47:38,055 --> 00:47:40,557
But you also said it was too big to be a baby tooth.

1020
00:47:40,591 --> 00:47:43,160
- Oh, it's definitely a baby tooth.

1021
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,562
The scary part about it is just how much

1022
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:47,231
of a baby this thing really is.

1023
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:49,366
Our ferocious, flesh-eating fish

1024
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:51,568
was just a newborn pup.

1025
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:52,870
- What?

1026
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:54,438
I mean, this thing's huge.

1027
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:55,706
How's that possible?

1028
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:58,075
- The proof is in the biology.

1029
00:47:58,075 --> 00:47:59,710
It's not prehistoric,

1030
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:02,246
though sharks are like alligators and they've

1031
00:48:02,246 --> 00:48:04,948
been around for 450 million years.

1032
00:48:05,015 --> 00:48:06,583
This thing isn't a fossil.

1033
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:09,186
It's a predator that has evolved to wear sand

1034
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:11,054
like a coat and travel through it like water.

1035
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:12,456
- How does it swim?

1036
00:48:13,857 --> 00:48:15,192
- It's all in the skin.

1037
00:48:15,192 --> 00:48:18,061
Its placoid scales have evolved to give them

1038
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:20,264
hydrodynamic advantages in the sand,

1039
00:48:20,264 --> 00:48:22,566
thus reducing turbulence and friction.

1040
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:25,235
Basically, it uses the tiny vortices

1041
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:28,038
in its scales to suction-cup from one grain

1042
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:28,972
to the next.

1043
00:48:28,972 --> 00:48:30,741
And it sucks out the water.

1044
00:48:30,774 --> 00:48:34,244
Which is why it seemingly likes to attack at night.

1045
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:36,613
Because that's when the sand is colder and more moist.

1046
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:41,618
- Well, lucky for us, this thing is dead.

1047
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:43,887
- Um, yeah.

1048
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:45,088
About that.

1049
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:47,591
This baby is dead.

1050
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:52,262
But keep in mind that it was a newborn.

1051
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:53,563
Just spawned.

1052
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:57,467
So that means that mommy is probably out there

1053
00:48:57,467 --> 00:48:58,735
looking for her lost pup.

1054
00:49:06,009 --> 00:49:10,013
- And then I looked up, and there he was, gone!

1055
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:11,315
My dad was gone!

1056
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:15,085
Don't you ever knock?

1057
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,820
- Jimmy, we got a problem.

1058
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:20,257
- Another one?

1059
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,126
Oh, God.

1060
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,294
Cancel my order.

1061
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:28,265
(soft music)

1062
00:49:47,784 --> 00:49:49,786
- Did I do good or what? - Hells yeah!

1063
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:57,561
- Dude!

1064
00:49:57,561 --> 00:49:58,662
- You hooked it up big time.

1065
00:49:58,695 --> 00:49:59,863
- And there's more coming too.

1066
00:49:59,863 --> 00:50:01,531
There was a thousand college kids on the dock

1067
00:50:01,565 --> 00:50:02,666
when we left.

1068
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:04,634
- You're so paranoid, bro.

1069
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:07,137
You got to have faith in the kid.

1070
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:09,339
(both laughing)

1071
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:10,841
- Yeah, man!

1072
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,509
- I mean, what can I say?

1073
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:13,710
It just comes to me in my sleep.

1074
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:15,545
I don't know, these like--

1075
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:16,580
- Ow!

1076
00:50:16,646 --> 00:50:18,081
Watch it, loser. - Damn, baby,

1077
00:50:18,081 --> 00:50:20,017
I'd pop you like a pill.

1078
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:21,251
- Yeah. - As if.

1079
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:23,387
Just go eat a pine cone, you crunchies.

1080
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:24,421
- All right, attitude.

1081
00:50:24,488 --> 00:50:25,589
Whatever.

1082
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:26,857
Peace. - Whatever, we're out of here.

1083
00:50:31,228 --> 00:50:32,896
If those are the type of guys that are here,

1084
00:50:32,896 --> 00:50:34,197
spring break's gonna bite.

1085
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:36,032
- Whatever.

1086
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:37,234
Come on. - Like I said,

1087
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:38,268
you did a real good job.

1088
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:40,170
Jimmy's gonna be hella impressed.

1089
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:41,738
- You think he'll promote me now?

1090
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:43,740
- No.

1091
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,575
You're still the intern.

1092
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:46,943
- Oh.

1093
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:49,179
- Hey, you're the electrician.

1094
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:50,380
Okay, cool.

1095
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:52,048
We got the stage setup and everything.

1096
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:53,917
Make sure you build it right.

1097
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:57,554
(ominous music)

1098
00:51:00,023 --> 00:51:02,359
- She's out there, and if she's anything like

1099
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:05,362
her offspring, she's big and she's hungry.

1100
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:07,564
- I hate to sound like a broken record, Jimmy,

1101
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:10,700
but these beaches stay closed.

1102
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:11,701
- No way.

1103
00:51:11,701 --> 00:51:13,103
It's too late.

1104
00:51:13,103 --> 00:51:15,472
Right now there are thousands of college kids

1105
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:17,541
storming the beaches of White Sands

1106
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:19,709
ready to spend lots and lots of money,

1107
00:51:19,709 --> 00:51:21,778
which means lots and lots of money

1108
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:23,280
for the people of this island.

1109
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:25,248
So if you kill this festival now,

1110
00:51:25,282 --> 00:51:27,918
then this island could be dead with it.

1111
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:30,253
- That's a risk I'm willing to take.

1112
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:32,789
- Oh, you might be, but the residents

1113
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:34,324
of this island aren't.

1114
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:36,293
So unless you're sure that there is another

1115
00:51:36,293 --> 00:51:37,394
shark out there?

1116
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:41,998
We think there is, but we're not positive.

1117
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:43,300
- Ha!

1118
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,302
So if you shut down this festival now,

1119
00:51:45,302 --> 00:51:46,636
you're just gonna seem paranoid.

1120
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:48,605
And if my dad was here, he would say,

1121
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:52,275
"Paranoia is not a good thing for an election year."

1122
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:53,610
That was a little more Richard Nixon

1123
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:54,845
than my dad, but you get the point.

1124
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:56,646
I do believe you're up for reelection,

1125
00:51:56,646 --> 00:51:57,614
aren't you, sheriff?

1126
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:00,650
- Fine.

1127
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:04,020
But the first sign of a shark by your people

1128
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:07,023
or mine, and this party is over.

1129
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:09,326
I wasn't prepared last time,

1130
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:11,795
but this time, we'll be ready.

1131
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:14,364
- Ho-ho!

1132
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,167
Looks like a sign from above.

1133
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:21,037
(dramatic music)

1134
00:52:22,005 --> 00:52:24,140
What up, party people?

1135
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:27,377
(all cheering)

1136
00:52:27,377 --> 00:52:28,778
- [Man] Yeah!

1137
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:31,815
- Welcome to the Sandman Festival.

1138
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:32,649
Woo, woo!

1139
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:35,719
- [Man] Yeah, Sandman!

1140
00:52:35,785 --> 00:52:38,788
- I'm your host, Jimmy Green. - Yeah Jimmy!

1141
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:41,358
- And this is going to be the biggest,

1142
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:45,562
the baddest, the hottest beach party on the planet!

1143
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:47,230
(all cheering)

1144
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:49,332
Forget Daytona, forget Cancun.

1145
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:52,536
There ain't no party like a Sandman party

1146
00:52:52,536 --> 00:52:54,971
'cause the Sandman party don't stop!

1147
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,306
- [Man] Yeah, never stops!

1148
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:57,707
Oh, yeah!

1149
00:52:57,707 --> 00:52:58,675
- Woo, yeah!

1150
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:03,346
Yeah!

1151
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,549
Before we get started, though,

1152
00:53:05,549 --> 00:53:07,817
I wanna dedicate this inaugural party

1153
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:09,686
to the memory of my dad, the late,

1154
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:11,721
great Mayor James Greenburg.

1155
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:13,223
Yes, yes.

1156
00:53:13,256 --> 00:53:16,092
Without his support, the Sandman Festival

1157
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:17,360
would still be a dream.

1158
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:19,896
So good looking out, Pop!

1159
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:22,265
(all cheering)

1160
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:24,167
Now, without further ado,

1161
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:26,770
I want you to put your worries about class

1162
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:29,940
to bed and let's wake up this beach with DJ Plan B!

1163
00:53:32,576 --> 00:53:33,710
Can you dig it?

1164
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:36,780
(upbeat dance music)

1165
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:55,532
(ominous music)

1166
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:17,988
- Brenda, why are you leaving your post?

1167
00:54:18,054 --> 00:54:19,256
- You want me to walk through the crowd

1168
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:20,790
and check things out at eye level?

1169
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:21,625
- No, no.

1170
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:22,459
I got it.

1171
00:54:22,459 --> 00:54:23,627
- You sure?

1172
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:25,061
- Yeah, I'll take care of it.

1173
00:54:28,131 --> 00:54:32,002
(upbeat dance music)

1174
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:34,971
- Ah, (chuckles).

1175
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:36,172
Ha!

1176
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:37,607
And you and tea bags were worried I wasn't

1177
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:38,975
gonna pull it off.

1178
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:41,811
(laughing) Oh, God.

1179
00:54:41,845 --> 00:54:42,812
Oh, my God.

1180
00:54:42,812 --> 00:54:43,913
Oh.

1181
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,415
Oh, good.

1182
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:46,816
Oh, Lord.

1183
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:47,651
Oh, yeah.

1184
00:54:47,651 --> 00:54:48,485
Oh, good.

1185
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:49,319
- Jimmy?

1186
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:53,690
(stammering)

1187
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:57,093
- It's not what it looks like.

1188
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,595
- I hope you die.

1189
00:54:58,595 --> 00:55:00,163
- You don't, you do?

1190
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:03,633
Hey, wait, I got--

1191
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:04,601
- Don't tell me you're thinking

1192
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:06,536
about Deputy Doughnuts over me.

1193
00:55:07,837 --> 00:55:08,772
- Bite me, Amanda.

1194
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:10,874
- I already did that.

1195
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:14,277
- You really are a man-eater, aren't you?

1196
00:55:15,779 --> 00:55:18,148
- You know why you'll always be in someone's debt, Jimmy?

1197
00:55:18,181 --> 00:55:20,016
You just don't have the head for business.

1198
00:55:20,016 --> 00:55:22,352
(screaming)

1199
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:30,193
Holy (stammering).

1200
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:31,061
Shark!

1201
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:34,664
Just one shark.

1202
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:35,832
Just one shark.

1203
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,000
Show must go on.

1204
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:37,834
Show must go on.

1205
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:39,569
Oh!

1206
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:41,371
- Yo! - Ah! (laughing)

1207
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:42,739
- [Willie] You're missing the show.

1208
00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:44,074
- Hey, Mr. Green, you all right?

1209
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:45,875
You look like you just saw a ghost.

1210
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:47,010
- No, no, no, no.

1211
00:55:47,043 --> 00:55:48,545
I'm good, it's all good.

1212
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:49,512
Let's par-tay!

1213
00:55:49,546 --> 00:55:50,413
Yeah. - Wait, wait.

1214
00:55:50,413 --> 00:55:51,347
I want a picture.

1215
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:52,515
Will you get with Mr. Green?

1216
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:54,684
- All right, okay, cool. - What, now?

1217
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:56,653
Hurry up, take the pic and we'll party.

1218
00:55:56,653 --> 00:55:57,921
- Let's go, White Sands!

1219
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:00,890
(screaming)

1220
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:01,858
- Oh, my God!

1221
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:03,526
Oh, my God!

1222
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:05,195
Is that Amanda?

1223
00:56:05,228 --> 00:56:06,496
Jimmy, what did you do?

1224
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:07,597
What did you do?

1225
00:56:07,597 --> 00:56:08,431
- Me?

1226
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:09,265
I didn't do anything.

1227
00:56:09,265 --> 00:56:10,100
It was the sand shark.

1228
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:11,401
A sand shark did it.

1229
00:56:11,401 --> 00:56:12,335
- Sand sharks?

1230
00:56:12,368 --> 00:56:13,603
I thought they were dead.

1231
00:56:13,603 --> 00:56:15,605
- Oh, man, I think I'm gonna be sick.

1232
00:56:15,605 --> 00:56:17,173
- Look, everybody just calm down.

1233
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,608
Pull yourselves together.

1234
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:19,776
- Calm down?

1235
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:21,511
Jimmy, we got to call the cops.

1236
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:22,712
We got to stop Sandman.

1237
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:24,414
What?

1238
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:26,082
- No, no, we can't.

1239
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:27,383
I can't! - What do you mean you can't?

1240
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:28,585
Of course you can.

1241
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:30,353
- I can't, Willie.

1242
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:32,922
You know what will happen to me if we close this down.

1243
00:56:32,922 --> 00:56:34,257
Besides, we got the greatest beach party

1244
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:35,558
in history going on.

1245
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:37,927
We can't blow that because some crazy

1246
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:39,429
mafia witch lost her head.

1247
00:56:40,797 --> 00:56:43,133
- Jimmy, it's just not about Amanda, okay?

1248
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:45,201
It's Sparky, it's your father,

1249
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,936
It's all the people that died so far.

1250
00:56:46,936 --> 00:56:49,072
- I know, I was there, Willie.

1251
00:56:49,105 --> 00:56:51,107
And for your information, my father,

1252
00:56:51,107 --> 00:56:55,545
Sparky and Amanda would all say the show must go on.

1253
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,747
So the show will go on.

1254
00:57:00,116 --> 00:57:01,951
- Are you serious right now?

1255
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:03,920
- As a heart attack.

1256
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,455
Or shark attack.

1257
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:07,257
- Willie, I think what Jimbo is trying to say

1258
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:08,958
is that we can't just cancel the party

1259
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:11,060
because a few people got killed, okay?

1260
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:12,462
That's bad business.

1261
00:57:12,462 --> 00:57:14,097
- Yeah, I got that, okay, Erin?

1262
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:15,598
All right, now you're just an intern,

1263
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:18,434
so why don't you shut up or go back to Target, okay?

1264
00:57:18,434 --> 00:57:20,303
- An intern who's been doing your job

1265
00:57:20,303 --> 00:57:21,805
since the day I started.

1266
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:22,672
- Whatever.

1267
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:24,274
Look, Jimmy, all right?

1268
00:57:24,307 --> 00:57:26,075
I put up with your games because your job pays

1269
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:27,510
well and it gets me a lot of perks,

1270
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:28,978
but this ain't no game, man.

1271
00:57:28,978 --> 00:57:29,979
This is real.

1272
00:57:29,979 --> 00:57:31,481
We got a lot of kids out there,

1273
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:34,017
and if this gets out it's game over for all of us.

1274
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:37,153
- Which is exactly why we can't say anything.

1275
00:57:37,153 --> 00:57:37,987
- Nah, man.

1276
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:38,822
The heck with this.

1277
00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:39,656
I'm out.

1278
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:42,025
(grunting)

1279
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:43,159
- Whoa!

1280
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:44,627
What are you doing?

1281
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:46,830
- Sharks are bad for business,

1282
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:49,165
but then again so are cowards.

1283
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:51,134
I guess you have to sacrifice if you wanna get ahead

1284
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:52,468
in this biz, right?

1285
00:57:52,468 --> 00:57:53,536
Just ask Amanda.

1286
00:57:55,371 --> 00:57:56,606
- I was right.

1287
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:57,874
You really are a shark, aren't you?

1288
00:57:57,874 --> 00:57:59,642
- Who, little old me?

1289
00:57:59,676 --> 00:58:01,177
No, I just know what I want

1290
00:58:01,177 --> 00:58:03,012
and what I'm willing to do to get it.

1291
00:58:03,012 --> 00:58:04,447
- Oh, you mean like kill someone?

1292
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:07,350
- That's a little headache when he wakes up.

1293
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:08,785
Okay, I'll tell you what.

1294
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:10,286
You go back to the party,

1295
00:58:10,286 --> 00:58:12,222
and I will clean all of this up,

1296
00:58:12,222 --> 00:58:13,957
and we're gonna pretend like none

1297
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,792
of this ever happened.

1298
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:17,193
- Hmm.

1299
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:19,829
I guess this means you're no longer an intern.

1300
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:23,333
- See, that's why I work for you.

1301
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,635
With you, Jimbo.

1302
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:26,870
You're quick.

1303
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:29,005
Now go enjoy your party.

1304
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:30,740
- Well, carry on, then.

1305
00:58:48,491 --> 00:58:50,727
(growling)

1306
00:58:58,935 --> 00:58:59,869
(upbeat dance music) - Woo!

1307
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:01,070
Aww yeah!

1308
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:03,673
(all cheering)

1309
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:09,746
- [Man] Yeah!

1310
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:15,518
Woo!

1311
00:59:15,518 --> 00:59:16,686
Aw yeah - Woo!

1312
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:24,727
Yeah!

1313
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:31,567
- [Man] Woo, aww yeah!

1314
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:33,603
- Hey, Sandy?

1315
00:59:33,603 --> 00:59:34,971
Sandy, you there?

1316
00:59:35,038 --> 00:59:36,539
I think I see one in the sand.

1317
00:59:36,572 --> 00:59:37,407
Your two o'clock.

1318
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:41,577
- I'm looking.

1319
00:59:43,579 --> 00:59:45,381
- Yeah, yeah. - Oh!

1320
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:46,883
Yeah!

1321
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:48,651
Woo, oh yeah.

1322
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:50,320
- [Man] Oh yeah!

1323
00:59:50,386 --> 00:59:51,955
- All I see are bouncing co-eds.

1324
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:56,292
- [Man] This is so fun, yeah!

1325
00:59:57,593 --> 01:00:01,965
Party, yeah. (ominous music)

1326
01:00:01,965 --> 01:00:04,500
- Yo! - Come on man.

1327
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:05,735
- Out of the way!

1328
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:07,937
Move, get out of the way, guys.

1329
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:10,273
- [Man] Yo, yo, yo, man, no!

1330
01:00:11,174 --> 01:00:12,508
- Whoa!

1331
01:00:12,508 --> 01:00:14,978
- Sandy, it's just some punk kids building

1332
01:00:14,978 --> 01:00:15,812
a sand castle.

1333
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:18,815
Stay off my beach.

1334
01:00:21,317 --> 01:00:23,019
- Yeah! - Oh, yeah!

1335
01:00:23,086 --> 01:00:25,655
(upbeat music)

1336
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:27,790
Oh yeah!

1337
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:31,461
- Ah!

1338
01:00:31,494 --> 01:00:32,328
Huh?

1339
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:34,931
We did it, Pop!

1340
01:00:34,931 --> 01:00:36,432
Ha-ha!

1341
01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:37,433
You and me!

1342
01:00:38,768 --> 01:00:40,837
Yeah, we saved this stupid island.

1343
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:43,806
No one believed in us.

1344
01:00:46,109 --> 01:00:47,276
I'm gonna miss you, Pop.

1345
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:49,278
I love you.

1346
01:00:50,847 --> 01:00:52,115
Brave in paradise.

1347
01:01:01,524 --> 01:01:03,659
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1348
01:01:04,627 --> 01:01:05,395
- Excuse me.

1349
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:10,133
Which one of you guys is Rex?

1350
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:12,335
- Uh, that's T-Rex to you.

1351
01:01:12,368 --> 01:01:14,137
And I'm a meat-eater.

1352
01:01:14,137 --> 01:01:16,706
I meet-- - Just stop, or I'll barf.

1353
01:01:17,707 --> 01:01:19,042
- Let's go, Hillary. - Wait.

1354
01:01:20,676 --> 01:01:22,011
We hear you guys have ex.

1355
01:01:24,147 --> 01:01:26,182
- Where'd you hear that from?

1356
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:27,717
- Everybody's been saying you got the best stuff.

1357
01:01:27,717 --> 01:01:29,385
Right, Grace? - Right.

1358
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:31,821
- No, drugs are bad.

1359
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:34,257
- Yeah, say no to drugs.

1360
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:35,258
- Spare me, okay?

1361
01:01:36,826 --> 01:01:37,994
So can we see some?

1362
01:01:40,063 --> 01:01:42,231
- I'll show you mine if you show him yours.

1363
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,835
No way.

1364
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:47,937
I am not showing that boy the girls.

1365
01:01:47,937 --> 01:01:48,738
- No, not him.

1366
01:01:49,705 --> 01:01:51,374
Sir Shark.

1367
01:01:51,407 --> 01:01:52,341
Sharky, sharky.

1368
01:01:56,612 --> 01:01:57,713
- Fine.

1369
01:01:57,747 --> 01:01:59,248
No peeking.

1370
01:01:59,248 --> 01:02:00,049
- No.

1371
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:09,926
- [Man] Ow, ow, woo!

1372
01:02:15,598 --> 01:02:18,701
(screaming)

1373
01:02:18,734 --> 01:02:21,070
(cheering)

1374
01:02:21,104 --> 01:02:23,106
They were building a sand...

1375
01:02:23,106 --> 01:02:25,441
(screaming)

1376
01:02:49,465 --> 01:02:53,236
- [Man] There's a shark, oh my God.

1377
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:55,505
- Brenda, sound the alarm!

1378
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:56,672
Sound the alarm for everyone!

1379
01:02:56,739 --> 01:02:58,241
Everybody get out of here!

1380
01:02:58,241 --> 01:02:59,075
Get out of here!

1381
01:02:59,075 --> 01:03:00,510
Let's go, go, come on!

1382
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:01,677
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1383
01:03:01,677 --> 01:03:03,513
Everybody out of here.

1384
01:03:05,748 --> 01:03:07,583
- Off the stage now.

1385
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:09,252
Get off!

1386
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:10,486
Everyone off the beach now.

1387
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:12,822
It's not safe, off, off now!

1388
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:16,159
Get off the beach. - I smell bacon!

1389
01:03:16,192 --> 01:03:18,027
(laughing)

1390
01:03:18,094 --> 01:03:20,930
(crowd screaming)

1391
01:03:50,626 --> 01:03:52,662
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1392
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:56,499
(shark growling)

1393
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:58,834
(screaming)

1394
01:04:08,244 --> 01:04:11,581
(growling) (gun firing)

1395
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:13,382
Oh, you stupid sharks.

1396
01:04:13,382 --> 01:04:15,818
You're gonna ruin everything.

1397
01:04:19,822 --> 01:04:20,656
No, no.

1398
01:04:20,656 --> 01:04:21,490
No, just wait.

1399
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:22,692
Just stop.

1400
01:04:22,725 --> 01:04:23,893
There's nothing to worry about, people.

1401
01:04:23,893 --> 01:04:24,860
- Jimmy! - Everything's gonna be fine.

1402
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:26,996
Just ignore the chaos.

1403
01:04:26,996 --> 01:04:28,197
Just keep dancing.

1404
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:29,599
Keep dancing!

1405
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:30,766
Keep, oh, man.

1406
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:33,035
No.

1407
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:33,936
Stop!

1408
01:04:33,936 --> 01:04:35,671
Everybody, just keep dancing.

1409
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:36,939
- Jimmy, let's go.

1410
01:04:36,939 --> 01:04:37,840
- No, no, no, no.

1411
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:38,774
I'm not leaving.

1412
01:04:38,774 --> 01:04:39,709
I'm staying and I'm fighting.

1413
01:04:39,742 --> 01:04:40,710
- No, now is not the time.

1414
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:41,877
Let's go!

1415
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:43,879
(shark roaring) - Hey, shark breath.

1416
01:04:43,879 --> 01:04:47,450
(laughing) First one's on me, buddy!

1417
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:50,219
(glass shattering) - No, come on!

1418
01:04:50,253 --> 01:04:51,420
- Let's get out of here.

1419
01:05:01,897 --> 01:05:04,700
(gun fires)

1420
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:06,869
We don't have time for this.

1421
01:05:06,869 --> 01:05:07,937
Hurry!

1422
01:05:08,971 --> 01:05:09,905
- Let's go!

1423
01:05:09,939 --> 01:05:10,740
Clear the beach, everybody.

1424
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,241
Let's go, everybody!

1425
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:13,376
Come on, let's go now.

1426
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:14,777
Everybody, let's go, let's go.

1427
01:05:14,777 --> 01:05:15,611
- Hurry, Brenda.

1428
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:18,814
Oh.

1429
01:05:22,385 --> 01:05:23,719
(shark roaring)

1430
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:25,254
Brenda?

1431
01:05:25,288 --> 01:05:26,455
Oh!

1432
01:05:26,455 --> 01:05:30,092
Oh, God.

1433
01:05:30,126 --> 01:05:31,794
Come on.

1434
01:05:31,794 --> 01:05:34,563
Stay with me.

1435
01:05:34,563 --> 01:05:36,799
(grunting)

1436
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:40,236
Hang in there.

1437
01:05:40,236 --> 01:05:41,237
Come on.

1438
01:05:41,237 --> 01:05:42,471
Stay with me.

1439
01:05:42,471 --> 01:05:43,739
Don't die on me.

1440
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:46,242
I can...I can get this back in you.

1441
01:05:46,242 --> 01:05:48,077
Oh, God!

1442
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:51,180
I'll just put it back in there and you'll be fine.

1443
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:52,515
Oh!

1444
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:53,783
Ugh!

1445
01:05:53,816 --> 01:05:54,650
Oh!

1446
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:00,356
God, Brenda.

1447
01:06:00,356 --> 01:06:01,357
Hang on.

1448
01:06:01,357 --> 01:06:02,191
Stay with me.

1449
01:06:02,191 --> 01:06:03,025
That's it.

1450
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:16,472
I know that it's probably isn't the best time

1451
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:17,840
to tell you this, but you know how

1452
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:20,343
when we used to be together I'd always tell you

1453
01:06:20,376 --> 01:06:22,044
that I didn't really love you and I just liked you a lot?

1454
01:06:22,044 --> 01:06:22,978
Well, I lied.

1455
01:06:23,012 --> 01:06:23,846
I actually do.

1456
01:06:23,846 --> 01:06:24,680
I really do love you.

1457
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:25,514
I love you.

1458
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:28,517
What?

1459
01:06:30,886 --> 01:06:32,188
- You're a jerk.

1460
01:06:33,789 --> 01:06:35,224
(sighing)

1461
01:06:35,224 --> 01:06:36,058
- Oh.

1462
01:06:42,965 --> 01:06:46,302
Ugh. (spits)

1463
01:06:46,302 --> 01:06:49,138
(dramatic music)

1464
01:06:49,138 --> 01:06:51,307
- Sandy, come on, come on!

1465
01:06:56,712 --> 01:06:57,546
- Give me your hand.

1466
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,428
Oh, my God, that was close.

1467
01:07:12,428 --> 01:07:13,929
- That was a little too close.

1468
01:07:14,764 --> 01:07:16,432
What was in that stuff?

1469
01:07:16,499 --> 01:07:18,167
- Highly concentrated chum juice.

1470
01:07:19,335 --> 01:07:20,536
- Chum juice?

1471
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:23,873
- (laughing) Yeah, it's this synthetic liquid

1472
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:24,874
that I invented.

1473
01:07:24,907 --> 01:07:27,276
It's like crack for sharks.

1474
01:07:27,276 --> 01:07:29,612
- Brenda, Brenda, are you there?

1475
01:07:29,678 --> 01:07:30,513
Brenda?

1476
01:07:31,747 --> 01:07:33,015
- Uh, okay.

1477
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:34,917
Hang on.

1478
01:07:34,917 --> 01:07:36,051
Just hang tight.

1479
01:07:36,051 --> 01:07:38,287
Oh, that looks terribly uncomfortable.

1480
01:07:38,287 --> 01:07:40,790
Here, let me get you...

1481
01:07:40,856 --> 01:07:42,925
Here, just wait right there

1482
01:07:42,925 --> 01:07:46,762
and I'm gonna. (groans)

1483
01:07:46,796 --> 01:07:49,198
You're a little bit, you'll be fine.

1484
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:53,736
- [John] Brenda, are you there?

1485
01:07:55,104 --> 01:07:56,439
Brenda, come in.

1486
01:07:56,439 --> 01:07:58,641
- No, no, this is Jimmy.

1487
01:07:58,707 --> 01:08:00,075
Hello?

1488
01:08:00,109 --> 01:08:01,710
- Jimmy, what are you doing on my frequency?

1489
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:02,912
Where Brenda?

1490
01:08:02,945 --> 01:08:03,779
- Uh...

1491
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:06,816
Oh, she, well,

1492
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:09,084
I don't really know

1493
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:13,222
how to tell you this, but, your sister's...

1494
01:08:13,222 --> 01:08:14,390
- What?

1495
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:18,093
- She was bitten in half by a shark.

1496
01:08:18,127 --> 01:08:21,130
Oh, my fault, it's my fault.

1497
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:22,264
All of it's my fault.

1498
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:24,400
The kids, my father, your sister.

1499
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,902
All of them being dead, it's my fault, I...

1500
01:08:28,637 --> 01:08:33,075
- (sniffs) Jimmy, everybody thought the thing was dead.

1501
01:08:33,108 --> 01:08:35,444
We weren't positive that there were others out there.

1502
01:08:35,478 --> 01:08:36,645
- I knew.

1503
01:08:36,645 --> 01:08:37,480
- You knew?

1504
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:38,981
When did you know?

1505
01:08:38,981 --> 01:08:41,417
- I saw another one just before the party started.

1506
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:43,185
It ate Amanda.

1507
01:08:43,185 --> 01:08:44,753
- And he didn't tell anyone?

1508
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:45,621
- I couldn't.

1509
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:46,655
You don't understand.

1510
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:49,792
If the party didn't go on, I'd be dead.

1511
01:08:49,825 --> 01:08:50,659
I mean, I am dead.

1512
01:08:50,659 --> 01:08:51,861
They're gonna kill me.

1513
01:08:51,861 --> 01:08:53,462
- They're not gonna have a chance to kill you,

1514
01:08:53,496 --> 01:08:54,864
because I'm gonna kill you.

1515
01:08:55,764 --> 01:08:57,933
15 people, including my sister,

1516
01:08:57,933 --> 01:08:59,602
died tonight because of you.

1517
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:02,638
I'm placing you under arrest for criminal negligence.

1518
01:09:02,671 --> 01:09:03,873
- Why would you do that?

1519
01:09:03,873 --> 01:09:05,374
- For throwing a party, you idiot!

1520
01:09:07,176 --> 01:09:08,944
- But I didn't kill anyone.

1521
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:10,646
Haven't I suffered enough?

1522
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:12,481
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

1523
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:16,352
You are gonna rot with guilt.

1524
01:09:16,352 --> 01:09:18,153
You may have not pulled the trigger,

1525
01:09:18,187 --> 01:09:20,122
but you supplied the bullet.

1526
01:09:20,122 --> 01:09:22,291
Or, in this case, the beach.

1527
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:24,727
(whimpering)

1528
01:09:27,796 --> 01:09:30,633
(engine starting)

1529
01:09:36,472 --> 01:09:40,809
- John, I don't wanna belittle the tragedy

1530
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:43,846
that's happened, but we're kind of stuck between a rock

1531
01:09:43,879 --> 01:09:45,147
and a shark place.

1532
01:09:47,049 --> 01:09:48,217
Any ideas on how to get off?

1533
01:09:54,757 --> 01:09:56,225
- Jimmy.

1534
01:09:56,225 --> 01:09:58,227
Jimmy, if you're there pick up the walkie.

1535
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:03,032
- Go for Jimmy.

1536
01:10:03,065 --> 01:10:04,233
- Look, I...

1537
01:10:08,904 --> 01:10:11,006
I may have overreacted a little bit there.

1538
01:10:12,908 --> 01:10:14,176
You're still going jail,

1539
01:10:14,176 --> 01:10:15,544
I'm just not gonna kill you.

1540
01:10:16,745 --> 01:10:17,580
But we need,

1541
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:20,249
we need your help.

1542
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:27,223
- Uh John, we have a major situation at the docks.

1543
01:10:28,691 --> 01:10:30,359
- Jimmy, did you say that you had a situation on the rocks?

1544
01:10:30,359 --> 01:10:31,594
- I said docks.

1545
01:10:31,594 --> 01:10:32,595
At the docks.

1546
01:10:34,263 --> 01:10:35,464
It doesn't look very good.

1547
01:10:35,464 --> 01:10:37,232
There's people all over the place.

1548
01:10:37,266 --> 01:10:38,767
You may have a riot on your hands,

1549
01:10:38,767 --> 01:10:41,403
and the ferry doesn't show back up until late tomorrow.

1550
01:10:41,437 --> 01:10:42,237
- Jeez.

1551
01:10:43,872 --> 01:10:47,042
Jimmy, get those kids off the docks.

1552
01:10:47,042 --> 01:10:49,211
They can't handle that many people.

1553
01:10:49,211 --> 01:10:50,045
Can you do that?

1554
01:10:50,045 --> 01:10:50,980
- I got this.

1555
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:52,081
- Just make sure we don't have

1556
01:10:52,114 --> 01:10:53,482
a repeat performance of earlier.

1557
01:10:53,482 --> 01:10:57,286
Now, crowds, they need to be handled with care.

1558
01:10:57,286 --> 01:10:59,888
And whatever you do, leave your siren off.

1559
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:01,090
We don't wanna create a...

1560
01:11:04,259 --> 01:11:09,264
Oh, my God.

1561
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:13,669
(people screaming)

1562
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:15,904
Jimmy, get those people off the docks!

1563
01:11:15,904 --> 01:11:17,973
- I got this, I got this.

1564
01:11:29,318 --> 01:11:30,152
(megaphone beeping)

1565
01:11:30,152 --> 01:11:31,654
Oh God.

1566
01:11:31,687 --> 01:11:35,190
Okay, everybody, get off the pier as quickly as you can.

1567
01:11:35,257 --> 01:11:36,091
Run, run!

1568
01:11:37,159 --> 01:11:38,494
Go on, get out of here.

1569
01:11:38,494 --> 01:11:39,328
Scram, beat it.

1570
01:11:40,195 --> 01:11:41,330
Is everything okay?

1571
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:42,931
Anybody need medical attention?

1572
01:11:44,166 --> 01:11:45,200
Anybody hurt?

1573
01:11:48,337 --> 01:11:50,039
Hey, you all right down there, kid?

1574
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:52,274
You need help?

1575
01:11:52,274 --> 01:11:53,108
- He got trampled.

1576
01:11:53,108 --> 01:11:54,276
He can't breathe.

1577
01:11:54,276 --> 01:11:55,044
- Uh?

1578
01:11:56,512 --> 01:11:58,447
Hey, anybody here study medicine?

1579
01:12:00,015 --> 01:12:00,783
No?

1580
01:12:02,017 --> 01:12:03,352
Just hang in there, kid.

1581
01:12:03,352 --> 01:12:04,820
I'll get...

1582
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:06,689
- (coughing) Sorry, dude, that was pretty good!

1583
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:08,490
(both laughing)

1584
01:12:08,524 --> 01:12:11,527
- Oh, yeah, that's real funny.

1585
01:12:11,527 --> 01:12:13,362
You didn't realize that there's people out here

1586
01:12:13,362 --> 01:12:15,030
being eaten alive right now, huh?

1587
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:17,666
Listen, listen to me.

1588
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:19,702
I know this is gonna sound crazy,

1589
01:12:19,702 --> 01:12:24,640
but there are actually sharks in the sand.

1590
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:27,009
No, you need to get off the beach right now.

1591
01:12:27,042 --> 01:12:29,411
You need to get up and you need to run and get

1592
01:12:29,411 --> 01:12:31,547
off of the beach, because, oh, my God.

1593
01:12:31,547 --> 01:12:33,148
You guys are idiots.

1594
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:34,349
(growling)

1595
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:35,217
Ugh.

1596
01:12:36,385 --> 01:12:37,586
Oh.

1597
01:12:37,653 --> 01:12:39,321
- Don't you got guns in there, brother?

1598
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:41,590
- Uh, not that I know of, no, I think--

1599
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:43,525
- Don't you got some at the station?

1600
01:12:43,559 --> 01:12:44,993
- Perhaps, I haven't checked.

1601
01:12:44,993 --> 01:12:48,030
- Tell you what, get back, get some firepower.

1602
01:12:48,063 --> 01:12:49,331
I'll handle things here.

1603
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:51,700
- Um...

1604
01:12:51,734 --> 01:12:55,704
- If you're waiting for me, you're going backwards.

1605
01:12:57,906 --> 01:12:58,907
Run, run!

1606
01:12:58,941 --> 01:13:00,242
You wanna be shark bait?

1607
01:13:00,242 --> 01:13:01,076
Run!

1608
01:13:01,076 --> 01:13:02,911
Run, get out of here.

1609
01:13:02,945 --> 01:13:05,614
Get out of here, you hear me?

1610
01:13:05,681 --> 01:13:08,350
(frantic music)

1611
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:24,566
- Whoa.

1612
01:13:26,401 --> 01:13:27,736
What are you doing here, I thought you were stuck on a rock?

1613
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:28,804
- We were.

1614
01:13:28,804 --> 01:13:30,305
We got off.

1615
01:13:30,305 --> 01:13:31,373
And why aren't you at the docks helping those kids

1616
01:13:31,406 --> 01:13:32,307
like I told you?

1617
01:13:32,307 --> 01:13:34,643
- I told the kid to leave.

1618
01:13:34,643 --> 01:13:36,645
- Are you ever seen before you're heard?

1619
01:13:37,946 --> 01:13:39,915
And why'd you tell them to leave?

1620
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:43,285
- Because I wasn't sure my gun would be enough.

1621
01:13:43,285 --> 01:13:45,988
- And? - It was.

1622
01:13:46,054 --> 01:13:47,823
- So the sharks are dead?

1623
01:13:47,823 --> 01:13:49,925
- Good lord, woman, no.

1624
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:52,728
No, there's way too many of them sons of guns.

1625
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:55,831
But I got everyone to safety I could.

1626
01:13:56,965 --> 01:13:58,634
- Well, thank you, Mr. McSorely.

1627
01:13:58,634 --> 01:13:59,802
We'll take it from here.

1628
01:14:00,803 --> 01:14:03,639
- You sure about that, son?

1629
01:14:05,474 --> 01:14:06,575
- It's sheriff.

1630
01:14:06,575 --> 01:14:08,410
And yeah, I am sure.

1631
01:14:09,645 --> 01:14:13,315
- 'Cause it seems to me that you folks have done

1632
01:14:13,315 --> 01:14:15,651
nothing but try to throw meatballs past a pack

1633
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:17,486
of hungry dogs.

1634
01:14:17,519 --> 01:14:19,154
- I'm not sure what that means,

1635
01:14:19,154 --> 01:14:21,323
but we're getting ready to do something else.

1636
01:14:21,356 --> 01:14:23,625
- (laughing) With guns?

1637
01:14:23,659 --> 01:14:25,828
You think guns are gonna stop a pack

1638
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:28,430
of man-eating sand terminators?

1639
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:30,766
- What other choice do we have?

1640
01:14:30,766 --> 01:14:33,468
We got thousands of kids stuck on this island,

1641
01:14:33,502 --> 01:14:35,771
no way to get them off.

1642
01:14:35,771 --> 01:14:38,941
The ferry won't be here for another day.

1643
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:41,777
- And waiting a day is too late.

1644
01:14:41,777 --> 01:14:45,881
By then, this island will be crawling with sand sharks.

1645
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:48,884
If they've tasted blood, they'll keep coming back

1646
01:14:48,951 --> 01:14:52,154
for more, like a porker at a cupcake buffet.

1647
01:14:53,622 --> 01:14:55,791
- Yeah, well, if you're the expert, what should we do?

1648
01:14:57,025 --> 01:14:59,161
- I wouldn't call myself an expert,

1649
01:14:59,194 --> 01:15:02,865
but I have been hunting these meat-eating sand suckers

1650
01:15:02,865 --> 01:15:05,300
for years and years.

1651
01:15:06,468 --> 01:15:08,971
And the lass has got the right idea.

1652
01:15:09,004 --> 01:15:12,174
You can't kill these fish in conventional ways.

1653
01:15:12,207 --> 01:15:15,344
You gotta think outside the sandbox.

1654
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:18,547
You gotta make the sand a sandbox.

1655
01:15:18,547 --> 01:15:22,050
and trap 'em in there like a giant shark tank.

1656
01:15:22,084 --> 01:15:24,653
- What the hell does that mean?

1657
01:15:27,155 --> 01:15:29,024
- Come with me.

1658
01:15:29,057 --> 01:15:30,726
I'll show youse.

1659
01:15:30,726 --> 01:15:33,428
(dramatic music)

1660
01:15:41,403 --> 01:15:44,439
- So just to be clear, you wanna lure the sharks

1661
01:15:44,506 --> 01:15:46,842
upstream and onto the beach,

1662
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:49,244
and then melt the sand with electricity,

1663
01:15:49,244 --> 01:15:52,014
thus trapping them in a glass prison?

1664
01:15:52,047 --> 01:15:53,115
That's about right?

1665
01:15:53,115 --> 01:15:54,616
- Aye.

1666
01:15:54,616 --> 01:15:56,251
- You're gonna need a bigger beach, Angus.

1667
01:15:56,251 --> 01:15:57,252
- Uh-huh.

1668
01:15:58,754 --> 01:16:01,423
This is me sandbox.

1669
01:16:03,592 --> 01:16:07,262
I first saw them sharks 30 years ago diving

1670
01:16:07,262 --> 01:16:08,964
at the bottom of the ocean.

1671
01:16:09,031 --> 01:16:12,100
I knew back then it was a matter of time

1672
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:13,735
before they came ashore.

1673
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:16,939
- This is insane.

1674
01:16:16,939 --> 01:16:18,407
There's no way this is gonna work.

1675
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:19,808
- What you mean, no way?

1676
01:16:19,808 --> 01:16:23,445
All we need's fuel hot enough to melt sand,

1677
01:16:23,445 --> 01:16:27,883
and the right bait to lure the sharks in here.

1678
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:31,086
- Well, we still have plenty of people, human chum.

1679
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:32,454
- You're an idiot, Jimmy.

1680
01:16:32,454 --> 01:16:34,056
What can we use for bait, Angus?

1681
01:16:35,624 --> 01:16:38,927
Nothing I've tried has brought enough of them together.

1682
01:16:40,128 --> 01:16:43,231
- What if we used the speakers from the party

1683
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:44,633
and we put them in the sand?

1684
01:16:44,633 --> 01:16:46,568
Sharks are attracted to movement and vibration.

1685
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:47,569
It'll work perfect.

1686
01:16:50,138 --> 01:16:53,442
- So you think you could draw enough sharks

1687
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:57,112
from all over the island using record speakers?

1688
01:16:57,112 --> 01:16:58,313
- Record speakers.

1689
01:16:58,313 --> 01:17:00,983
(laughing) Now who's the idiot?

1690
01:17:02,784 --> 01:17:05,287
- Yes, if the vibrations were strong enough,

1691
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,656
we could lure the sharks wherever we wanted them.

1692
01:17:07,656 --> 01:17:10,459
It just depends on how loud the speakers get.

1693
01:17:10,492 --> 01:17:11,994
- Well, if I turn mine up to 11,

1694
01:17:11,994 --> 01:17:13,495
it'll shake the entire island.

1695
01:17:13,495 --> 01:17:14,963
They're the best, I should know.

1696
01:17:14,963 --> 01:17:16,298
I paid for them.

1697
01:17:16,331 --> 01:17:17,833
- What about the fuel?

1698
01:17:17,833 --> 01:17:22,337
How hot does it need to be to melt the sand into glass?

1699
01:17:22,337 --> 01:17:25,707
- It needs to be a fuel that's gonna burn extra hot.

1700
01:17:25,707 --> 01:17:28,010
Over 2,000 degrees.

1701
01:17:29,144 --> 01:17:30,712
- I don't have anything like that.

1702
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:36,885
- (clearing throat) I might.

1703
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:40,188
- Really?

1704
01:17:40,188 --> 01:17:42,624
You have something that burns over 2,000 degrees?

1705
01:17:42,657 --> 01:17:44,159
- Maybe.

1706
01:17:44,192 --> 01:17:46,128
But I would need some type of proof that this is gonna work

1707
01:17:46,128 --> 01:17:47,963
before I'd be willing to break it out.

1708
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:55,504
- This is a piece of the shark that ate Sparky.

1709
01:17:56,371 --> 01:17:57,873
(whimpering)

1710
01:17:57,873 --> 01:17:59,875
It's covered in glass.

1711
01:17:59,908 --> 01:18:01,677
from the sand and electricity.

1712
01:18:01,710 --> 01:18:04,813
- Well, is that proof enough for youse?

1713
01:18:04,813 --> 01:18:06,314
Hm?

1714
01:18:06,314 --> 01:18:07,682
Let's go fishing.

1715
01:18:09,551 --> 01:18:10,519
Come on.

1716
01:18:10,552 --> 01:18:13,221
(ominous music)

1717
01:18:16,224 --> 01:18:21,229
(horn honking) (dramatic music)

1718
01:18:38,246 --> 01:18:40,449
(grunting)

1719
01:19:17,919 --> 01:19:20,655
(engine revving)

1720
01:19:32,934 --> 01:19:35,804
- I love the smell of napalm in the afternoon.

1721
01:19:35,804 --> 01:19:37,072
- This is all you got?

1722
01:19:37,105 --> 01:19:38,440
- It's highly concentrated.

1723
01:19:38,473 --> 01:19:41,109
Trust me, a little bit goes a long way.

1724
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:43,745
- (scoffing) We'll see.

1725
01:19:46,982 --> 01:19:48,316
- Napalm, baby.

1726
01:19:48,316 --> 01:19:49,151
Napalm.

1727
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:52,854
- Better work.

1728
01:20:05,634 --> 01:20:07,435
Are you sure you got enough juice for this?

1729
01:20:07,435 --> 01:20:08,336
- Are you kidding?

1730
01:20:08,336 --> 01:20:09,871
I patched into the local grid.

1731
01:20:09,938 --> 01:20:12,541
- That's good to know the next time we have a power outage.

1732
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:13,975
All right, everybody ready?

1733
01:20:14,009 --> 01:20:15,710
- Let's get this party started.

1734
01:20:15,710 --> 01:20:16,545
- Yeah.

1735
01:20:21,816 --> 01:20:25,320
("Ride of the Valkyries")

1736
01:21:06,995 --> 01:21:09,231
(rumbling)

1737
01:21:29,584 --> 01:21:31,186
- There's one.

1738
01:21:31,219 --> 01:21:32,387
There are two, hey!

1739
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:34,289
They're starting to fill up the whole beach.

1740
01:21:34,289 --> 01:21:35,390
- [Together] Yeah!

1741
01:21:35,423 --> 01:21:36,558
- [Sandy] They think it's food.

1742
01:21:38,927 --> 01:21:39,728
- What?

1743
01:21:39,761 --> 01:21:40,929
Wait a minute.

1744
01:21:43,131 --> 01:21:44,532
What happened?

1745
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:45,567
- The power's out.

1746
01:21:46,701 --> 01:21:48,036
- No, power's still on.

1747
01:21:49,871 --> 01:21:52,140
- That front speaker, it must have come unplugged.

1748
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:52,974
- I'll go check it out.

1749
01:21:52,974 --> 01:21:54,309
- Are you nuts?

1750
01:21:54,309 --> 01:21:55,310
You can't go out there.

1751
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:56,645
It's swarming with sand sharks.

1752
01:21:56,711 --> 01:21:57,946
You'll be fish food for sure.

1753
01:21:57,946 --> 01:21:59,447
- Unfortunately, she's right, John.

1754
01:21:59,481 --> 01:22:01,750
You wouldn't make it 10 feet with that leg.

1755
01:22:01,783 --> 01:22:03,084
I can't believe I'm gonna say this,

1756
01:22:03,084 --> 01:22:05,553
but I'll fix it.

1757
01:22:05,553 --> 01:22:06,888
- [Both] What?

1758
01:22:06,888 --> 01:22:08,223
- [John] Jimmy, you don't have to go.

1759
01:22:08,223 --> 01:22:09,591
- I'm going.

1760
01:22:09,624 --> 01:22:11,960
I got us into this mess, I'll get us out.

1761
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:13,261
- Jimmy, you don't have to.

1762
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:15,931
- This is something that I have to do.

1763
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:17,432
For my father, your sister,

1764
01:22:17,432 --> 01:22:19,768
Sparky and all the rest of them.

1765
01:22:21,069 --> 01:22:21,970
I owe them a debt,

1766
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:22,904
this is how I'm gonna repay it.

1767
01:22:22,937 --> 01:22:24,472
The show must go on.

1768
01:22:24,472 --> 01:22:26,241
- Jimmy, you know that this isn't a party

1769
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:27,442
that ends at midnight.

1770
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:30,512
It's your life.

1771
01:22:30,578 --> 01:22:32,580
- Once it's gone, party's over.

1772
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:35,417
- I know.

1773
01:22:36,918 --> 01:22:38,420
- Jimmy.

1774
01:22:38,453 --> 01:22:39,287
Just in case.

1775
01:22:41,022 --> 01:22:42,524
- No, thanks.

1776
01:22:42,524 --> 01:22:44,025
I'm not planning on being out there long enough to use it.

1777
01:22:44,025 --> 01:22:46,127
- All right, good luck, Jimmy.

1778
01:22:46,161 --> 01:22:47,662
- I don't do that.

1779
01:22:57,672 --> 01:22:59,474
Don't worry, I got it!

1780
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:03,978
Whoa!

1781
01:23:04,012 --> 01:23:04,846
Oh, oh!

1782
01:23:13,021 --> 01:23:14,389
- Come on, Jimmy.

1783
01:23:15,523 --> 01:23:18,526
- Oh.

1784
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,628
- What's he waiting for?

1785
01:23:20,662 --> 01:23:22,664
The sharks are swarming all around him.

1786
01:23:22,697 --> 01:23:23,531
- It's not gonna work.

1787
01:23:23,531 --> 01:23:25,066
I can't fix it.

1788
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:28,203
It's been ripped in half!

1789
01:23:28,203 --> 01:23:30,372
It's not gonna be fixable!

1790
01:23:30,405 --> 01:23:32,307
- There's got to be something else we can do.

1791
01:23:36,211 --> 01:23:37,212
They're all over him.

1792
01:23:42,650 --> 01:23:46,688
- Well, Pop, looks like I'll be joining you soon.

1793
01:23:52,026 --> 01:23:52,861
Oh.

1794
01:23:58,433 --> 01:23:59,667
- John, they're all over him.

1795
01:23:59,701 --> 01:24:01,002
We got to figure out how to help him.

1827
01:25:00,462 --> 01:25:02,130
Who's ready for some fried fish?

1828
01:25:15,643 --> 01:25:17,812
(panting)

1829
01:25:20,682 --> 01:25:21,850
- Jimmy.

1830
01:25:21,850 --> 01:25:24,285

1831
01:25:38,633 --> 01:25:39,467
Okay.

1832
01:25:42,103 --> 01:25:44,372
- I told you I'd bring their heads.

1833
01:25:44,372 --> 01:25:48,142
Hook, line and sinker.

1834
01:25:48,176 --> 01:25:50,378
(laughing)

1835
01:25:52,146 --> 01:25:53,348
- We did it.

1836
01:25:53,348 --> 01:25:54,849
- No. - We did it.

1837
01:25:55,717 --> 01:25:56,985
- Jimmy did it.

1838
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:01,022
(Angus laughing)

1839
01:26:01,022 --> 01:26:01,856
- Yeah.

1840
01:26:05,727 --> 01:26:08,730
- Angus, where the hell did you get that flamethrower?

1841
01:26:09,864 --> 01:26:11,399
- Homemade.

1842
01:26:11,399 --> 01:26:13,568
Bought all the parts on eBay.

1843
01:26:13,635 --> 01:26:17,472
Which reminds me, now that the mayor's gone,

1844
01:26:17,472 --> 01:26:20,642
don't that make you acting mayor?

1845
01:26:20,675 --> 01:26:22,076
- Yeah, I think it does.

1846
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:26,314
- So, what's the deal with the internet lately?

1847
01:26:26,314 --> 01:26:27,148
Huh?

1848
01:26:27,148 --> 01:26:27,982
It's...

1849
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:46,267
It's been...

1850
01:26:47,435 --> 01:26:49,003
slower than death.

1851
01:26:53,942 --> 01:26:55,009
(roaring)

1852
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:56,611
Uh-oh.

1853
01:26:56,611 --> 01:26:57,779
(yells)

1854
01:26:57,779 --> 01:26:58,680
- Jesus!

1855
01:26:58,713 --> 01:26:59,714
- Run. - Go inside.

1856
01:26:59,747 --> 01:27:02,417
(dramatic music)

1857
01:27:06,888 --> 01:27:07,722
(screaming)

1858
01:27:07,722 --> 01:27:08,723
Giant killer!

1859
01:27:08,723 --> 01:27:09,857
Get out!

1860
01:27:09,857 --> 01:27:13,528
(gun firing) Come on you mother!

1861
01:27:18,466 --> 01:27:21,469
The bullets aren't working!

1862
01:27:21,536 --> 01:27:22,971
Ah!

1863
01:27:22,971 --> 01:27:23,972
(roaring)

1864
01:27:23,972 --> 01:27:25,473
- Stop, stop!

1865
01:27:25,473 --> 01:27:26,708
Come on, get out of the way, jump out the window!

1866
01:27:26,741 --> 01:27:29,611
Out the window, it's the only way out.

1867
01:27:32,947 --> 01:27:34,215
Come on, let's go.

1868
01:27:34,215 --> 01:27:36,384
(panting)

1869
01:27:37,986 --> 01:27:40,655
- Eat this, you sand of a bitch!

1870
01:27:41,723 --> 01:27:44,759
(shark roaring)

1871
01:27:44,792 --> 01:27:47,495
(dramatic music)

1872
01:28:02,744 --> 01:28:05,580
(explosion booms)

1873
01:28:13,021 --> 01:28:15,189
(panting)

1874
01:28:19,594 --> 01:28:22,263
- Well, apparently, Dr. Powers,

1875
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:24,799
sand sharks do turn into land sharks.

1876
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,302
Ugh!

1877
01:28:27,302 --> 01:28:28,136
God.

1878
01:28:33,007 --> 01:28:35,777
(dramatic music)

1879
01:28:49,023 --> 01:28:49,857
- Hello?

1880
01:28:51,192 --> 01:28:52,026
Jimmy?

1881
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:54,962
(cell phone vibrating)

1882
01:28:54,996 --> 01:28:55,830
Hello?

1883
01:28:57,198 --> 01:28:59,500
Oh, no, Mr. Green isn't here right now.

1884
01:29:01,035 --> 01:29:02,570
Oh, you can't reach him either?

1885
01:29:04,038 --> 01:29:07,208
That is actually because I am taking over his clients.

1886
01:29:08,876 --> 01:29:10,978
And you say you wanna throw a beach party?

1887
01:29:12,046 --> 01:29:14,382
Yes, yes, I can help you.

1888
01:29:15,683 --> 01:29:18,252
Beach parties are to die for.

1889
01:29:19,087 --> 01:29:21,489
(dramatic music)

1890
01:29:21,522 --> 01:29:23,591
(growling) (screaming)

1891
01:29:23,591 --> 01:29:26,027
(soft music)
