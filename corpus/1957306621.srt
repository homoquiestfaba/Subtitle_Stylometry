[phone rings]
Oh, sorry.

259
00:12:26,505 --> 00:12:28,241
Can you just give me a second?

00:12:30,212 --> 00:12:32,047
Hey Shauna,

00:12:32,082 --> 00:12:33,983
did you see the graphics
of the bouncing low riders?

263
00:12:34,018 --> 00:12:35,380
[Shauna] No, I don't give a
damn about low riders, Walter.

264
00:12:35,415 --> 00:12:37,052
Yeah, it's pretty
fly stuff right?

265
00:12:37,087 --> 00:12:38,548
Yeah, we're getting
dozens of responses.

266
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,858
[Shauna] Where's
the damn money?

267
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,552
What, no?

268
00:12:42,587 --> 00:12:45,896
[Shauna] That's why our
credit's in the damn toilet.

269
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,030
What do you mean our
credits in the toilet?

270
00:12:48,065 --> 00:12:50,835
In fact, it depends on
how your defining toilet.

271
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,870
[Shauna] That's
money for the kids.

272
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,003
No.

273
00:12:54,038 --> 00:12:55,433
[Shauna] I'm gonna take them.

274
00:12:55,468 --> 00:12:57,336
You can't take the
boys away from me.

275
00:12:57,371 --> 00:12:58,337
[Shauna] I'm leaving and
they're coming with me.

276
00:12:58,372 --> 00:12:59,140
Oh my God, just.

277
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,341
I really got a good feeling
about this, this is the big one.

278
00:13:02,376 --> 00:13:04,244
[Shauna] That's it,
it's the last straw.

279
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:06,081
Just stick with
me, honey, honey!

280
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:09,854
[Camera man] Everything okay?

281
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,450

[chill hip hop music]

285
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,909
This is my kitchen.

286
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:33,405
Where I cook things I like.

287
00:13:35,013 --> 00:13:36,375
I don't know what
white folks like.

288
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:37,508
That's the living room.

289
00:13:40,183 --> 00:13:42,315
That's where I play dominoes.

290
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,152
Hey, hey, don't touch that!

291
00:13:44,187 --> 00:13:45,857
Still got a game going.

292
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:47,892
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

293
00:13:51,227 --> 00:13:52,127
Who's she?

294
00:13:55,363 --> 00:13:56,263
That's Ella May.

295
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:00,366
Sweetest most faithful
woman to ever live.

296
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,105
[harp fading in]

297
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,338
Ella, I wanna
give you something.

298
00:14:05,373 --> 00:14:06,845
I wanna give you this ring.

299
00:14:08,211 --> 00:14:10,112
Gerald, Where'd you
get this ring from?

300
00:14:10,147 --> 00:14:13,115
I know you didn't buy me no
ring with no gambling money.

301
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,919
I don't want no gambling ring.

302
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:16,888
I told you I ain't
gambling no more.

303
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:19,286
I got this ring with
my hard earned money,

304
00:14:19,321 --> 00:14:20,551
and I want you to have it.

305
00:14:21,455 --> 00:14:22,322
I ain't lying.

306
00:14:23,688 --> 00:14:26,458
Then I'll wear it,
and cherish it forever!

307
00:14:28,297 --> 00:14:29,934
Shit, you better cherish
that damn ring forever.

308
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,496
You with me for the long haul.

309
00:14:31,531 --> 00:14:33,432
Till death, do us part.

310
00:14:33,467 --> 00:14:34,565
Okay.

311
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,566
[mosquito buzzing]

312
00:14:35,601 --> 00:14:36,908
Goddam mosquito.

313
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:38,536
Where the waiter at? Goddamn.

314
00:14:38,571 --> 00:14:40,175
Been waiting for our
damn food for 30 minutes.

315
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,243
All they brought us
is some damn wine.

316
00:14:42,278 --> 00:14:43,145
I'm hungry!

317
00:14:44,082 --> 00:14:47,182
[harp fading out]

318
00:14:47,217 --> 00:14:48,579
That's your room on the left.

319
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:51,923
Wait a minute.

320
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,353
Slow your roll son.

321
00:14:53,388 --> 00:14:55,256
Everything in here
is important to me.

322
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,994
I don't want you to forget that.

323
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,095
Neat, I definitely
will, Granddad.

324
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,558
And I'm not your granddad!

325
00:15:00,593 --> 00:15:02,395
Do we look related?

326
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,199
My good for nothing,
all the time, son

327
00:15:04,234 --> 00:15:05,937
ditched you on me.

328
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:08,302
And that's what this
is, social service.

329
00:15:08,337 --> 00:15:10,502
So since we gotta be
trapped in here together,

330
00:15:10,537 --> 00:15:12,240
I got some rules and shit.

331
00:15:13,606 --> 00:15:15,705
Don't touch nothing
that ain't yours.

332
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,675
Wash your ass, keep
my house clean,

333
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,743
and make yourself useful.

334
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:24,549
White privilege is a foreign
term in Compton, boy.

335
00:15:24,584 --> 00:15:26,650
If you didn't
know, now you know.

336
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:29,422
And that's my room on the right.

337
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,063
Whoa, that's a lot of pills.

338
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,999
Hey, don't touch those.

339
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,298
They're for my heart.

340
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,970
I forget them sometimes.

341
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:41,071
So you see them lying
around, leave them be.

342
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:45,570
And you must be Ms. Jeffries.

343
00:15:45,605 --> 00:15:47,341
Mr. McDonough.

344
00:15:47,376 --> 00:15:50,179
Yes, Walter McDonough,
so nice to meet you.

345
00:15:50,214 --> 00:15:51,609
Pleasure to meet you.

346
00:15:51,644 --> 00:15:54,249
Please, let me show
you around the venue.

347
00:15:54,284 --> 00:15:57,087
Now, Pastor recently
bought this place.

348
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:00,288
So it's still a
work in progress.

349
00:16:00,323 --> 00:16:02,257
Oh, don't mind the mess.

350
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,063
As long as you don't
mind my camera crew here!

351
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,427
You're so gorgeous!

352
00:16:07,462 --> 00:16:08,659
You should be in the movies!

353
00:16:08,694 --> 00:16:10,529
Oh, I wish I was.

354
00:16:10,564 --> 00:16:13,103
I mean, this crib could
use some renovations.

355
00:16:14,436 --> 00:16:16,271
I mean, wasn't
Jesus a carpenter?

356
00:16:16,306 --> 00:16:19,010
Yes, and a divine one.

357
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:21,045
Oh, all right.

358
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,178
Well, hopefully
he'll come back soon.

359
00:16:22,213 --> 00:16:23,740
We could really use him, huh?

360
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:26,017
You know, I'm just,
I'm like a chameleon.

361
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:28,580
I'm always rebuilding
myself, rebranding.

362
00:16:28,615 --> 00:16:31,583
After 34 years of
award-winning service,

363
00:16:31,618 --> 00:16:35,290
they just revoked my
retirement fund, huh?

364
00:16:35,325 --> 00:16:38,590
I guess you don't send a
little old mimis around

365
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,658
with the lady showing her-

366
00:16:40,693 --> 00:16:42,330
But, uh, you know,

367
00:16:42,365 --> 00:16:44,233
so I had to dabble in a
lot of different things.

368
00:16:44,268 --> 00:16:48,303
And some of them were just
right before their time.

369
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:52,406
[chuckles softly]

370
00:16:52,441 --> 00:16:54,705
You know, they say
you miss a 100%

371
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,278
of the shots you don't take.

372
00:16:56,313 --> 00:16:59,215
So I'm glad I took those swings.

373
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,811
It's just unfortunate that
they ricocheted right back

374
00:17:01,846 --> 00:17:03,615
and hit me in the nuts.

375
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:07,553
Oh, this way to
the pastor's office.

376
00:17:07,588 --> 00:17:09,522
He should be in there now.

377
00:17:09,557 --> 00:17:10,655
Give you a hand there.

378
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,228
Thank you, Mr. McDonough.

379
00:17:12,263 --> 00:17:13,097
There you go.

380
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,263
Follow me.

381
00:17:14,298 --> 00:17:17,827
[pastor praying quietly]

382
00:17:17,862 --> 00:17:19,169
Goddamn, Ms. Jeffries.

383
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,830
Even the Devil knocked twice.

384
00:17:20,865 --> 00:17:22,733
I was just spreading some...

385
00:17:22,768 --> 00:17:25,604
[Ms. Jeffries] God comes
in a thief in the night.

386
00:17:25,639 --> 00:17:27,276
[Pastor] Yeah, He do.

387
00:17:27,311 --> 00:17:28,706
Okay, we brought a
guest, a visitor.

388
00:17:28,741 --> 00:17:32,314
Pastor Steele, this
is Mr. Walter McDonough.

389
00:17:32,349 --> 00:17:35,680
He's the gentleman who's
going to rent the venue

390
00:17:35,715 --> 00:17:37,253
tomorrow afternoon.

391
00:17:37,288 --> 00:17:38,617
His crew is loading
in right now.

392
00:17:38,652 --> 00:17:40,751
Okay, you got my check, right?

393
00:17:40,786 --> 00:17:41,620
Yeah, yeah, I sure do.

394
00:17:41,655 --> 00:17:42,786
It's right here.

395
00:17:42,821 --> 00:17:44,095
Yeah, there you go.

396
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,295
All right, all right.

397
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,626
Thank you, Jesus.

398
00:17:47,661 --> 00:17:49,232
All right, Ms. Jeffries,

399
00:17:49,267 --> 00:17:50,662
You go and run that
money down to the bank.

400
00:17:50,697 --> 00:17:52,499
You know, take care of,

401
00:17:52,534 --> 00:17:55,139
and I'll put you on
[indistinct] later, all right?

402
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:57,570
Be marching with you, okay?

403
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,377
Shit, for an old lady,

404
00:18:02,412 --> 00:18:04,346
Ms. Jeffries got ass.

405
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:09,450
But anyway, you know, this
was a Mexican restaurant.

406
00:18:09,485 --> 00:18:11,386
And they was selling
some nasty tacos.

407
00:18:11,421 --> 00:18:13,256
That's why it shut
down, but you know,

408
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,819
and then I decided to
get ordained by the Lord

409
00:18:15,854 --> 00:18:18,195
and we went into
business together.

410
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,493
So we got a lot to do, man.

411
00:18:19,528 --> 00:18:21,132
A lot to catch up on.

412
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:22,760
So I'm going to
take y'all around

413
00:18:22,795 --> 00:18:24,234
in the spirit of the Lord.

414
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:29,866
[chill hip hop music

415
00:18:35,412 --> 00:18:36,510
Granp...

416
00:18:36,545 --> 00:18:37,445
Mr. Edges, your food is ready.

417
00:18:38,943 --> 00:18:40,547
Hot damn Rufus,
it's been your play

418
00:18:40,582 --> 00:18:42,648
for the last five
fucking minutes.

419
00:18:42,683 --> 00:18:43,616
Mr....

420
00:18:43,651 --> 00:18:45,288
Not now, boy!

421
00:18:45,323 --> 00:18:46,388
Can't you see I'm busy?

422
00:18:47,424 --> 00:18:49,193
[Andy sighs]

423
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,755
What, boy? You're
breaking my concentration.

424
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,658
Well, your food's ready.

425
00:18:52,693 --> 00:18:55,397
My mom says the body needs
three square meals a day

426
00:18:55,432 --> 00:18:56,596
to be happy and healthy.

427
00:18:58,402 --> 00:18:59,896
You sure she stopped at three?

428
00:19:00,965 --> 00:19:03,306
What I need is to play somebody

429
00:19:03,341 --> 00:19:04,835
who ain't just sold their fridge

430
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,639
to get that China Brown.
[Rufus snoring]

431
00:19:06,674 --> 00:19:09,477
What I need is somebody
I can talk shit to.

432
00:19:09,512 --> 00:19:10,907
You can talk shit to me.

433
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:12,414
Watch your fucking
mouth in my house.

434
00:19:15,716 --> 00:19:17,518
What you know about them bones?

435
00:19:17,553 --> 00:19:19,652
It's basic
probability, really.

436
00:19:19,687 --> 00:19:21,588
It all comes down to
how many variations

437
00:19:21,623 --> 00:19:23,227
of numbers you can play

438
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:24,855
based on the factors of
the hand you've drawn.

439
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,297
And then you calculate the
most efficient statistical one,

440
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,200
until you're down
to a single tile.

441
00:19:32,469 --> 00:19:33,765
You mean you know
how to play this shit?

442
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,505
Well, I, uh, yeah.

443
00:19:38,376 --> 00:19:39,639
Hell, Andy!

444
00:19:39,674 --> 00:19:40,937
Shit!

445
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:41,905
Hell!

446
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,774
Damn!

447
00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:43,907
Shit!

448
00:19:43,942 --> 00:19:45,942
Why didn't you say so?

449
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:47,284
Rufus.

450
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,450
Rufus!

451
00:19:48,485 --> 00:19:50,980
Take your ass home!

452
00:19:51,015 --> 00:19:52,916
No, no way down
to the damn floor.

453
00:19:52,951 --> 00:19:55,292
Go on home, you
ain't no good here!

454
00:19:57,494 --> 00:19:59,857
I'm gonna call your mama
and tell you on your way.

455
00:20:00,926 --> 00:20:01,892
You know I ain't got no car.

456
00:20:01,927 --> 00:20:03,564
You calling me an Uber?

457
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:04,565
Uber?

458
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,731
The fuck is a Uber?

459
00:20:05,766 --> 00:20:06,897
I got some Goobers.

460
00:20:06,932 --> 00:20:08,437
You want some peanuts?

461
00:20:08,472 --> 00:20:09,504
Bye, Rufus.

462
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:13,607
Let's see what you got.

463
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:19,217
Watch them.

[mellow hip hop music]

something like that?

What kind of Twilight Zone
have I just slipped into?

475
00:20:50,448 --> 00:20:52,008
Is this what a
stroke feels like?

476
00:20:54,617 --> 00:20:57,783
Sorry, well, my mom
says I don't make friends

477
00:20:57,818 --> 00:21:00,291
because they're intimidated
by my intellect.

478
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:02,425
And that I should be
proud of my gifts.

479
00:21:03,527 --> 00:21:05,362

light, or much light at all,

little albino sausage fingers

484
00:21:13,603 --> 00:21:15,801
learn to throw bones like that?

485
00:21:15,836 --> 00:21:17,671
Oh, from this app.

486

App?

00:21:18,707 --> 00:21:20,509
The fuck is a app?

488

It's a way you can
play people on the phone.

489
00:21:21,908 --> 00:21:23,644
It was actually
beating the AI system

490
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,514
that got me so proficient
at it and the...

Fuck, wait a goddamn minute!

492
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:28,517
You're telling me you ain't
playing against people

494
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:32,521
Well, there are other
opponents on their phones, too.

You can't play bones
with a screen, boy.

all about the mental game

just as much as
it is the numbers.

You hear me?

00:21:53,841 --> 00:21:54,840

can't cheat for you.

It ain't cheating actually.

What's you got in your hand?

518
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:29,512
Double six.

00:22:29,547 --> 00:22:30,513
No, no, elephant ass, no.

motherfucking speaking ass.

All right?

524

Lord, help me, he
got a ways to go.

525
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:43,625
You know, you sure talk a lot

526
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:47,662
but I'm beating you 75 to 25.

527
00:22:47,697 --> 00:22:48,564
Are you?

528
00:22:49,633 --> 00:22:51,600
You think you're winning, huh?

529
00:22:53,769 --> 00:22:56,440
What I see across from me

530
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:58,508
is a neglected little boy.

531
00:22:59,577 --> 00:23:01,170
You know my son is

532
00:23:01,205 --> 00:23:03,106
[chair squeaking]

533
00:23:03,141 --> 00:23:05,141
pumping your momma right now.

534
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:09,420
Putting an integrated
baby in her with my DNA.

535
00:23:09,455 --> 00:23:11,785
That's going to be
stronger, faster,

536
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:15,822
and a million times more
mocha latte lovelier than you.

537
00:23:15,857 --> 00:23:17,956
And when that baby comes,

538
00:23:17,991 --> 00:23:19,826
it ain't gonna take no time

539
00:23:19,861 --> 00:23:23,929
forgetting your pasty, two
tons of fun ass ever existed.

540
00:23:25,768 --> 00:23:26,734
[slams domino onto table]

541
00:23:26,769 --> 00:23:27,636
Domino.

542
00:23:28,639 --> 00:23:30,474
See.

543
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:33,708
You don't win at bones unless
you get in the folks head.

544
00:23:34,744 --> 00:23:36,876
The game is all mental.

545
00:23:38,715 --> 00:23:40,110
I'm tired of this game.

546
00:23:40,145 --> 00:23:42,552
Why don't you me about
that scary devil guy

547
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:43,982
you were talking about?

548
00:23:44,017 --> 00:23:46,050
Never mentioned that
guy's name in my house.

549
00:23:46,085 --> 00:23:47,689
And if there is a God,

550
00:23:47,724 --> 00:23:49,152
he'll give me my revenge

551
00:23:49,187 --> 00:23:51,220
at this tournament
I'm training for.

552
00:23:51,255 --> 00:23:54,124
I want the whole
world to see me whoop

553
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,599
that tweaking bully's ass!

554
00:23:58,669 --> 00:24:01,065
[funky music]

555
00:24:06,204 --> 00:24:08,039
See, usually ladies,

556
00:24:08,074 --> 00:24:11,482
I don't mingle amongst
them gangster thug

557
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:14,210
sober motherfuckers.

558
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:15,948
Who in the fuck gonna
gang bang if you're sober?

559
00:24:15,983 --> 00:24:18,654
That's silly, I
don't trust them.

560
00:24:18,689 --> 00:24:21,888
See, if I want to win this
tournament and get my crown,

561
00:24:21,923 --> 00:24:25,529
I had to call in the
baddest gangster bitches

562
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:27,157
security guards I know.

563
00:24:27,192 --> 00:24:29,192
And it was you and you.

564
00:24:29,227 --> 00:24:32,162
You gotta understand
this is about me.

565
00:24:32,197 --> 00:24:34,769
I am the greatest
motherfucker that ever lived.

566
00:24:34,804 --> 00:24:36,067
There's God.

567
00:24:36,102 --> 00:24:36,969
And then,

568
00:24:38,137 --> 00:24:39,807
there is me!

569
00:24:39,842 --> 00:24:41,270
[laughing loudly]

570
00:24:41,305 --> 00:24:44,174
[snorting cocaine loudly]

571
00:24:44,209 --> 00:24:47,683
[high pitched excited yelling]

572
00:24:47,718 --> 00:24:50,114
[funky music]

573
00:24:54,087 --> 00:24:56,186
You know the Lord
laid his hand down

574
00:24:56,221 --> 00:24:57,693
in this one right here.

575
00:24:57,728 --> 00:24:59,629
You know, this is the room.

576
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:02,027
You know, this is the one
for all my entrepreneurs.

577
00:25:02,062 --> 00:25:04,227
You know, the big wigs.

578
00:25:06,099 --> 00:25:07,967
- Yeah man, what a blessing.
- So, but this is the lobby?

579
00:25:08,002 --> 00:25:09,870
Oh yeah, yeah, what a
blessing, what a blessing.

580
00:25:09,905 --> 00:25:12,169
Well it just seemed like the
pictures made it look bigger

581
00:25:12,204 --> 00:25:13,170
in the pamphlet.

582
00:25:13,205 --> 00:25:15,040
Yeah, we do that.

583
00:25:15,075 --> 00:25:17,581
Namita, hold off one second.

584
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:19,682
Is this ceiling load-bearing?

585
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:21,882
Uh, partially.

586
00:25:21,917 --> 00:25:23,587
Hey, God bless you.

587
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:25,886
Well, let's just
hold off for a second.

588
00:25:25,921 --> 00:25:27,756
Till I get this figured out.

589
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:31,122
I got a lot of run
running on this

590
00:25:31,157 --> 00:25:34,862
and I can't have any lawsuits

591
00:25:34,897 --> 00:25:38,701
'cause I've technically
maxed out my credit cards

592
00:25:38,736 --> 00:25:41,132
and put a lien on my house.

593
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:42,936
But it's all good.

594
00:25:42,971 --> 00:25:44,234
It's all good.

595
00:25:44,269 --> 00:25:45,774
Whoa!

596
00:25:45,809 --> 00:25:47,776
Oh, I gotta sit down.

597
00:25:47,811 --> 00:25:48,843
Woo, who knew?

598
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:51,912
But yeah, it's good.

599
00:25:51,947 --> 00:25:53,210
You know, I haven't
seen my kids in a while.

600
00:25:53,245 --> 00:25:55,784
Ever since my wife threw me out.

601
00:25:55,819 --> 00:25:57,621
She said, and I quote,

602
00:25:59,251 --> 00:26:03,286
"I'm an abject failure and
a complete joke of man."

603
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:05,860
But I think this tournament's

604
00:26:05,895 --> 00:26:06,960
gonna turn everything
around, right?

605
00:26:06,995 --> 00:26:07,829
[claps]

606
00:26:07,864 --> 00:26:08,830
Yeah!

607
00:26:08,865 --> 00:26:10,029
We can do this, right?

608
00:26:10,064 --> 00:26:11,998
Namita, give me, give it up.

609
00:26:12,033 --> 00:26:13,868
All right, yeah.

610
00:26:13,903 --> 00:26:15,771
My name is Namita Sodhi.

611
00:26:15,806 --> 00:26:18,202
I am the event coordinator
and general task master

612
00:26:18,237 --> 00:26:19,643
for the WDC.

613
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:22,371
I'd like to say, for the record,

614
00:26:22,406 --> 00:26:24,307
that I'm here to serve my
client's personal needs

615
00:26:24,342 --> 00:26:25,946
and tastes.

616
00:26:25,981 --> 00:26:27,079
And that if I were
running things,

617
00:26:27,114 --> 00:26:29,818
my decisions would have been,

618
00:26:29,853 --> 00:26:31,721
different.

619
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,349
But considering the I'm
the only, even marginally,

620
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:35,252
competent person here,

621
00:26:35,287 --> 00:26:37,122
I think things could have
turned out a lot worse.

622
00:26:37,157 --> 00:26:41,126
And by that, I mean we've
yet to have anyone seriously,

623
00:26:41,161 --> 00:26:42,127
injured.

624
00:26:42,162 --> 00:26:43,128
[ladder clacking]

625
00:26:43,163 --> 00:26:44,129
[Man] Oh, shit.

626
00:26:44,164 --> 00:26:45,130
This is fucking heavy.

627
00:26:45,165 --> 00:26:46,362
Oh shit, shit, shit!

628
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:48,166
[glass and metal crashing]

629
00:26:48,201 --> 00:26:51,268
And this is my
prize back here.

630
00:26:51,303 --> 00:26:54,645
'Cause the Lord said,
"Let there be light!"

631
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,978
[electricity zapping]

632
00:26:58,013 --> 00:26:58,847
There it is.

633
00:26:58,882 --> 00:27:00,145
Oh, yeah.

634
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,246
Does that happen a lot?

635
00:27:02,281 --> 00:27:04,985
Oh, when you got
Jesus on the main line,

636
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,020
anything is possible.

637
00:27:07,055 --> 00:27:08,153
Okay.

638
00:27:08,188 --> 00:27:10,925
And I call this my incubator.

639
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:16,095
These are the companies
and the brands that I own.

640
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,228
It's not for you.

641
00:27:17,263 --> 00:27:18,361
I got some big stuff for you.

642
00:27:18,396 --> 00:27:20,264
I got the big room for you.

643
00:27:20,299 --> 00:27:22,838
This is just
collaborations of brands

644
00:27:22,873 --> 00:27:25,269
I wanted to introduce
you to, you know,

645
00:27:25,304 --> 00:27:27,139
like I can partner with you.

646
00:27:27,174 --> 00:27:28,778
Well, it's nice.

647
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:29,779
It's not exactly
what I envisioned

648
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,209
but what's that saying?

649
00:27:31,244 --> 00:27:33,145
"A shoddy craftsman
blames his tools."

650
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,784
[Pastor laughing]

651
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,148
I don't know what the
fuck you talking about

652
00:27:36,183 --> 00:27:38,348
but do you wanna
partner with Mac Woo?

653
00:27:38,383 --> 00:27:40,185
Macaroni and sushi?

654
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,824
Bomb.

655
00:27:41,859 --> 00:27:43,892
Oh, sure we're always
looking for sponsors.

656
00:27:43,927 --> 00:27:46,158
Yeah, I'm just really
excited to get going here.

657
00:27:46,193 --> 00:27:47,225
It's gonna be a great show.

658
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,996
Me too.

659
00:27:49,031 --> 00:27:50,932
And so when Ms.
Jeffries' cash that check

660
00:27:50,967 --> 00:27:53,869
and it go "cha-ching",
then we can go.

661
00:27:53,904 --> 00:27:57,840
Until then, you don't want
me and the Lord on your ass.

662
00:27:57,875 --> 00:27:59,237
No, no I don't.

663
00:27:59,272 --> 00:28:01,371
Don't don't make
me pray for you, boy.

664
00:28:01,406 --> 00:28:02,273
Okay.

665
00:28:03,441 --> 00:28:05,111
[sighing exasperatedly]

666
00:28:05,146 --> 00:28:06,376
[electricity buzzing]

667
00:28:06,411 --> 00:28:08,147
Oh, come on! Namita!

668
00:28:08,182 --> 00:28:10,182
Can you please do
something about this light?

669
00:28:11,251 --> 00:28:12,954
Hey, Walter, it's cool.

670
00:28:12,989 --> 00:28:14,054
I got this.

671
00:28:15,354 --> 00:28:16,353
[sighs loudly]

672
00:28:16,388 --> 00:28:18,025
I'm sorry.

673
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,928
We just got such a
big show planned.

674
00:28:19,963 --> 00:28:21,358
People are gonna be asking
you what are you doing here?

675
00:28:21,393 --> 00:28:23,360
They'll be all up in your grill.

676
00:28:23,395 --> 00:28:27,771
But fact of the matter is,
once we have our winner,

677
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:31,170
we'll be able to edit this
together in a nice tight promo.

678
00:28:31,205 --> 00:28:33,337
And sell it to a
couple of investors

679
00:28:33,372 --> 00:28:35,075
I got coming out
on tournament day.

680
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,748
So, everything goes as planned,

681
00:28:37,783 --> 00:28:39,442
we're gonna be in business.

682
00:28:39,477 --> 00:28:40,784
[Cameraman] You really
think you can get this off

683
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:41,477
without a hitch?

684
00:28:42,546 --> 00:28:43,919
Well, you know what?

685
00:28:43,954 --> 00:28:47,351
I've pretty much
lost everything.

686
00:28:47,386 --> 00:28:51,025
So what's the worst
that could happen, huh?

687
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,928
His dumbass got no idea.

688
00:28:52,963 --> 00:28:54,160
Follow me, ladies.

689
00:28:57,033 --> 00:28:58,428
I'm trying to tell y'all

690
00:28:58,463 --> 00:29:00,265
and then when we do
what we gotta do.

691
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,872
What the fuck?

692
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,467
Do you know who
the fuck that is?

693
00:29:04,502 --> 00:29:06,007
No, cuz.

694
00:29:06,042 --> 00:29:06,843
Well kick the
motherfucker in the ass!

695
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:07,811
Get him!

696
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:09,780
[women yelling]

697
00:29:09,815 --> 00:29:12,343
[man grunting and yelling]

698
00:29:12,378 --> 00:29:15,819
[laughing loudly]

699
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:17,447
This is my brother!

700
00:29:17,482 --> 00:29:18,822
Ain't these some bad
motherfuckers, aint they?

701
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:20,285
You better tell them who I am!

702
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,518
Okay, calm down,
calm down, calm down.

703
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:24,157
We don't need to
kill my brother.

704
00:29:24,192 --> 00:29:26,357
Boy, y'all are some bad
motherfuckers though.

705
00:29:26,392 --> 00:29:28,062
Now y'all get back over there.

706
00:29:28,097 --> 00:29:29,899
Take my keys, what we doing

707
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,803

00:37:32,548 --> 00:37:33,910
You know you're still white

889
00:37:33,945 --> 00:37:35,516
even though you
wear Nike's, right?

890
00:37:35,551 --> 00:37:36,913
Man, pay attention
what I'm saying!

891
00:37:36,948 --> 00:37:38,783
My bad, nigga, my bad.

892
00:37:38,818 --> 00:37:40,422
What I'm saying is, before
I even could do anything

893
00:37:40,457 --> 00:37:41,687
she walked in on me
with her sister, man.

894
00:37:41,722 --> 00:37:42,820
Fucked up.

895
00:37:42,855 --> 00:37:44,756
Ah, man, what'd you say?

896
00:37:44,791 --> 00:37:46,395
Man, I said I was trying
to get to know her family

897
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,825
a little better, you
know what I'm saying?

898
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:48,991
Get a little relations
with the relatives,

899
00:37:49,026 --> 00:37:50,960
you know what I'm saying?

900
00:37:50,995 --> 00:37:51,961
Shit, nigga, did it work?

901
00:37:51,996 --> 00:37:53,831
No, it didn't work!

902
00:37:53,866 --> 00:37:55,503
I can't take my advice from
Shaggy songs, my nigga.

903
00:37:55,538 --> 00:37:56,504
That only works for
light skinned niggas

904
00:37:56,539 --> 00:37:57,274
with their shirts off.

905
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,543
Hey, did you just

907
00:38:04,008 --> 00:38:05,612

00:38:05,647 --> 00:38:06,613

909
00:38:06,648 --> 00:38:07,746
That's 10 thou-wow!

910
00:38:07,781 --> 00:38:09,748
Oh we about to get it, nigga.

[Gerald panting]

912
00:38:24,061 --> 00:38:25,698
What kind of ghetto
ass operation is this,

913
00:38:25,733 --> 00:38:27,095
not having a ramp
for my wheelchair?

914
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:28,734
Y'all trying to kill the king

915
00:38:28,769 --> 00:38:30,538
before I get a chance
to sit in my throne?

916

[Namita] Oh my god!

920
00:38:38,614 --> 00:38:39,712
[Gerald] Just let his
body completely shut down

921
00:38:39,747 --> 00:38:41,384
and reboot itself stronger.

922
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:42,814
That's the way real
black slaves did it.

923
00:38:42,849 --> 00:38:45,047
And you're welcome for
the history lesson.

924
00:38:45,082 --> 00:38:46,114
You poor thing.

925
00:38:46,149 --> 00:38:47,885
Are you okay?

926
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,919
Thank you.

927
00:38:49,823 --> 00:38:50,756
I love you.

Okay.

Hi, I'm Andy.

Get out of my
fucking way, kid!

933
00:39:14,782 --> 00:39:17,882
Look, you can't be going around
with my name in your mouth

934
00:39:17,917 --> 00:39:19,554
acting softer than baby shit.

935
00:39:19,589 --> 00:39:22,392
You got to take
pride in yourself.

936
00:39:22,427 --> 00:39:23,822
You wanna be a Edges?

937
00:39:23,857 --> 00:39:26,825
You don't take nothing
off of nobody, ever.

938

[funky, psychedelic music]

939
00:39:32,129 --> 00:39:32,996
Shit.

940
00:39:35,638 --> 00:39:39,035
Ladies and gentlemen,
Tenspeed is in the building.

944
00:39:49,916 --> 00:39:54,919
You wanna get this [indistinct]

945
00:39:57,462 --> 00:39:59,858
Ha, if it ain't the S.N.I.C!

946
00:40:04,898 --> 00:40:06,964
You know what that means,
little white fella?

947
00:40:06,999 --> 00:40:07,833
No.

948
00:40:07,868 --> 00:40:08,834
[laughing]

949
00:40:08,869 --> 00:40:09,703
Well, let me tell you.

950
00:40:11,003 --> 00:40:14,444
If it ain't the saddest
nigga in Compton,

951
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:15,742
Gerald motherfucking Edges.

952
00:40:17,779 --> 00:40:18,712
Tenspeed.

953
00:40:20,243 --> 00:40:22,749
I see that rehab
went terribly bad.

954
00:40:24,049 --> 00:40:25,950
The judge must've
been on drugs.

955
00:40:25,985 --> 00:40:28,117
He shouldn't have been trying
to stop me from doing cocaine.

956
00:40:28,152 --> 00:40:29,822
I love cocaine, nigga.

957
00:40:29,857 --> 00:40:31,758
That's not what this is about.

958
00:40:31,793 --> 00:40:34,431
This is about if you think
you finna come to Compton

959
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:39,194
and take my victory from me.

960
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:42,571
See, let me explain something
to you about winning.

961
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:46,773
Only a loser would lose
something so precious.

962
00:40:46,808 --> 00:40:47,906
You're a loser, Gerald.

963
00:40:47,941 --> 00:40:49,809
You can't fool a nigga like me.

964
00:40:49,844 --> 00:40:53,945
You lost the most precious
thing that God gave to man.

965
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,783
That you vowed that
you could keep it

966
00:40:56,818 --> 00:40:57,949
and you lost it!

967
00:40:59,524 --> 00:41:02,492
When you get your ass
played at dominoes,

968
00:41:02,527 --> 00:41:04,692
you think about this.

969
00:41:04,727 --> 00:41:06,221
It's 2020.

970
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:10,500
You run around
here like it's 1974

971
00:41:10,535 --> 00:41:12,931
with all that goddam chest
hair on your goddam chest.

972
00:41:12,966 --> 00:41:14,570
You look ridiculous!

973
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:16,803
You need to get a tattoo
that says "Flammable".

974
00:41:16,838 --> 00:41:17,936
[laughing]

975
00:41:17,971 --> 00:41:19,234
I love this shit.

977
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:25,977
Come on, Andy.

978
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:32,786
Don't worry, Grandad.

979
00:41:32,821 --> 00:41:34,249
No matter what it takes,

980
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:35,921
if it means bending
the rules a little,

981
00:41:35,956 --> 00:41:37,956
I'm gonna help you
bury his second rate

983
00:41:40,059 --> 00:41:43,093
Because Edges stand up
for themselves, right?

984
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,932
You damn skippy, my
little soda cracker.

985

Look at all this sweet shit!

Hell, look at all

All this sweet shit.

990
00:42:00,211 --> 00:42:03,586
Let me add a little,

991
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:06,116
a little flavor to this.

992
00:42:06,151 --> 00:42:07,656
Tenspeed flavor.

993
00:42:08,956 --> 00:42:10,054
Don't want to put too much...

994
00:42:10,089 --> 00:42:11,891
Just balance my blood sugar.

1002
00:42:33,376 --> 00:42:35,277
Really?

1003
00:42:35,312 --> 00:42:37,114
Yeah, it's on my parole
bar, you know what I mean?

1004
00:42:37,149 --> 00:42:38,247
I just got out.

1005
00:42:38,282 --> 00:42:39,952
You know, I did like a quick 10.

1006

I don't even know what's
bracking these days.

1007

What you like to do?

1008

You like going to the binema?

1009

Sorry, what?

1010
00:42:46,994 --> 00:42:48,895
The movies, you like
going to the movies?

Oh, mm-hmm.

1012
00:42:49,931 --> 00:42:51,832
Okay, bull, bull.

1013
00:42:51,867 --> 00:42:53,933
So maybe after this, we can
go catch like a [indistinct]

1014

matinee or something?

1015

I'm more of a Netflix
& chill girl, honestly.

1016
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:01,171
All right, Netflix is bull.

1017
00:43:01,206 --> 00:43:02,942
I could do that, what's that?

1018
00:43:02,977 --> 00:43:03,943
That's the new shit?

1019
00:43:03,978 --> 00:43:05,076
Okay, I'm with that.

1020
00:43:05,111 --> 00:43:06,077
My name right there though.

Excuse me, miss!

1023
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,620
I'm gonna need you
to hold on a second.

1024
00:43:10,655 --> 00:43:11,280
I'm gonna need you to step
over here for a second,

Random search!

1027
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:15,185
I really don't think
that's necessary.

1028
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:16,989
I rolled a dice and
his number came up!

1029
00:43:17,024 --> 00:43:18,628
I want you to know I'm extremely
proficient with a taser.

1030
00:43:18,663 --> 00:43:20,223
And I have a certificate.

1031
00:43:20,258 --> 00:43:21,763
I'm gonna need you to
assume the position

1032
00:43:21,798 --> 00:43:22,764
I'm sure you're familiar.

1033

Please spread them!

1034
00:43:23,932 --> 00:43:25,635
Oh my god this is ridiculous!

What's going on here!

1036
00:43:26,902 --> 00:43:27,868
Is this a weapon?

1037
00:43:27,903 --> 00:43:28,869
Is this a weapon?

1038
00:43:28,904 --> 00:43:30,002
Are you moving suddenly?

1039
00:43:30,037 --> 00:43:31,366
Do not move suddenly, sir!

I got this under
control ma'am!

It's a spork, blood.

1043
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,712
I don't do forks no more, man.

1044
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:37,713
They too sharp.

1045
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:39,176
And spoons are too dull.

1046
00:43:39,211 --> 00:43:41,079
That's a hybrid utensil, blood.

1047
00:43:42,687 --> 00:43:43,345
A spork.

1048
00:43:45,184 --> 00:43:47,184
All right, I'm gonna need to
take this one to the back.

1049
00:43:47,219 --> 00:43:48,053
Why?

1050
00:43:48,088 --> 00:43:49,417
Why?

1051
00:43:49,452 --> 00:43:50,693
[Security Guard]
Ma'am, let me do my job!

I have an online degree!

1053
00:43:51,388 --> 00:43:52,695
No!

1054
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:53,696
All right, full cavity search.

1055
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:54,356
The fuck you say?

1056
00:43:54,391 --> 00:43:55,698
Stand down!

1057
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:56,864
Don't you know who this is?

1058
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:01,198
This is legendary
Bonesmith Big Slams.

1059
00:44:01,233 --> 00:44:02,298
From the D Block.

1060
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:03,739
Come on, G.

1061

I am so sorry, Mr. Slams.

1062
00:44:08,141 --> 00:44:09,745
It's bull.

1063
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,439
It is not bull,
it is not bull.

We're gonna treat you like
the pampered prince you are.

All right?

1068
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:22,791
And some cocoa butter so
your elbows don't get ashy.

1069

Definitely more than ours!

1100
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:23,511

Am I the only one

Oh yes, I love the
Lord, hallelujah.

Praise the Lord.

1162
00:47:35,216 --> 00:47:37,084
You know, because the
Lord says, don't be cruel,

1163
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:41,418
'cause I will never
be that cruel to you.

1164
00:47:41,453 --> 00:47:43,057
You know.

1165
00:47:43,092 --> 00:47:44,190
[indistinct] said
it's my prerogative.

1166
00:47:45,127 --> 00:47:45,961
You know?

1167
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:46,995
Didn't Bobby...

[objects clanking]

1169
00:47:48,691 --> 00:47:49,558
You're coming up in
here with bounced checks,

1170
00:47:49,593 --> 00:47:51,131
playing with me.

1171
00:47:51,166 --> 00:47:52,165
You thinks this is a game?

1172
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,463
No, no, no.

1173
00:47:53,498 --> 00:47:54,464
It's not a game.

1174
00:47:54,499 --> 00:47:56,103
Listen, about that,

1175
00:47:56,138 --> 00:47:57,071

You can have it.

1181
00:48:03,442 --> 00:48:05,013
Gate money?

1182
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:06,146
[indistinct] Oh, you're
giving me permission

1183
00:48:06,181 --> 00:48:06,641
to have my own fucking money?

1184
00:48:08,381 --> 00:48:10,645
I will cut a mother fucking
pie hole out of you.

1185
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,251
Hold on.

1186
00:48:12,286 --> 00:48:13,120

1188
00:48:14,024 --> 00:48:15,122
Yeah, yeah.

1189
00:48:15,157 --> 00:48:16,552
Guess what, guess what?

1190
00:48:16,587 --> 00:48:17,685
I got three, 50
pound cockroaches.

1191
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,060
The size of pit bulls right

[metal clanking]

1193
00:48:21,295 --> 00:48:22,129
You hear me?

1194
00:48:22,164 --> 00:48:22,998
Cockroaches?

1195
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:24,065
Yeah, yeah.

1196
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,066
God, no.

Hey, what?

1198
00:48:26,498 --> 00:48:28,102
Oh, you're gonna use
the Lord's name in vain?

1199
00:48:28,137 --> 00:48:29,037
- No.
- Huh?

1200
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:30,170
I didn't.

1201
00:48:30,205 --> 00:48:31,303
In my fucking establishment?

1202
00:48:31,338 --> 00:48:33,338
Do you know I'm a man of God?

1203
00:48:33,373 --> 00:48:34,977
Clearly.

1204
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:37,177
You got till 4:00

[chains rattling]

1211
00:48:45,484 --> 00:48:47,253
Oh Lord, forgive me.

1212
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:50,993
Cockroach, cockroaches?

1213
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:55,459
[upbeat hip hop music]

1214
00:49:03,238 --> 00:49:05,975
[laughs loudly]

1215
00:49:07,605 --> 00:49:09,605
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for coming out.

1216
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,310
Oh, hi there.

1217
00:49:13,149 --> 00:49:15,380
So we're getting about to
get started in a minute.

1218
00:49:15,415 --> 00:49:17,382
Oh look, we got some
hotties coming in.

1219
00:49:19,221 --> 00:49:21,089
Just want y'all to know
we're gonna get this show

1220
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:22,090
on the road.

1221
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:22,750
So just sit back.

1222
00:49:22,785 --> 00:49:24,422
Yeah, sit back.

1223
00:49:24,457 --> 00:49:25,324
Time to party.

1224
00:49:27,559 --> 00:49:29,966
All right, let's hear
from DJ Dominoes.

1225
00:49:30,694 --> 00:49:31,561
Oh yeah.

1226
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:34,003
Y'all know what time it is.

1227
00:49:34,038 --> 00:49:36,269
It's your girl DJ Dominoes.

1228
00:49:36,304 --> 00:49:38,700
[imitating horn sounds]

1229
00:49:38,735 --> 00:49:43,078
I'm here to drop knowledge
and drop some dope sport beat.

1230
00:49:44,675 --> 00:49:47,775
Not trying to hate, but I
taught her everything she knows.

1231
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:49,414
Facts.

1232
00:49:49,449 --> 00:49:51,350
Let's take a look at
our strongest contenders

1233
00:49:51,385 --> 00:49:53,121
as we enter the first round.

1234
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:55,024
On table one, we have Tenspeed.

1235
00:49:55,059 --> 00:49:57,356
The highest ranked player
according to Liberty Parks,

1236
00:49:57,391 --> 00:49:58,786
top 10 winners.

1237
00:49:58,821 --> 00:50:01,195
He's most famously
here for his ability

1238
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:04,528
to mind fuck opponents,
hard and deep

1239
00:50:04,563 --> 00:50:05,793
with no lubrication, y'all.

1240
00:50:05,828 --> 00:50:07,597
Somebody move all your asses.

1241
00:50:07,632 --> 00:50:10,336
Then there's big
slams on table two.

1242
00:50:10,371 --> 00:50:13,042
Who've been locked up
for the last 14 years

1243
00:50:13,077 --> 00:50:14,439
and it has shit else
to do but play bones

1244
00:50:14,474 --> 00:50:16,573
for 23 hours in his cell.

1245
00:50:16,608 --> 00:50:20,214
And on table three,
got Camilla Ines.

1246
00:50:20,249 --> 00:50:23,811
Known for her lewd and
downright nasty trash talk.

1247
00:50:23,846 --> 00:50:26,286
Oh, Ines is getting personal.

1248
00:50:26,321 --> 00:50:28,684
It looks like a family
rivalry is a brew

1249
00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:32,556
as her cousin Fredrico,
a big time champ himself

1250
00:50:32,591 --> 00:50:34,426
sits at table four.

1251
00:50:35,825 --> 00:50:38,760
On table five, we've
got Pimpdaddy fresh,

1252
00:50:38,795 --> 00:50:43,270
a retired pimp whose fashion
sense is a mix of mace,

1253
00:50:43,305 --> 00:50:45,734
bargain, late 2000s.

1254
00:50:45,769 --> 00:50:47,571
We don't really know.

1255
00:50:47,606 --> 00:50:49,474
But it doesn't seem like
Pimpdaddy has his opponent yet

1256
00:50:49,509 --> 00:50:52,114
as we wonder where the
great veteran Gerald Edges

1257
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:53,379
has disappeared to?

1258
00:50:53,414 --> 00:50:55,249
Somebody find me a man.

1259
00:50:55,284 --> 00:50:57,713
Where are you at? [indistinct]

1260
00:50:57,748 --> 00:50:59,418
Are you hanging out
with aunt Jemimah?

1261
00:50:59,453 --> 00:51:00,518
What's you doing?

1262
00:51:00,553 --> 00:51:02,322
All right.

1263
00:51:02,357 --> 00:51:04,225
So you have a flip
phone, so texting is out.

1264
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:06,128
Okay, this is three, five.

1265
00:51:09,496 --> 00:51:11,397
This is four, six.

1266
00:51:15,568 --> 00:51:18,239
And if you have any doubles,

1267
00:51:18,274 --> 00:51:22,309
it can be, oh, Lord,
it's hot in here.

1268
00:51:22,344 --> 00:51:23,145
All right?

1269
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:24,575
Get it?

1270
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:26,544
Yeah, I got it, I'm
black and I see now,

1271
00:51:26,579 --> 00:51:28,315
and it ain't that
damn difficult.

1272
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:30,680
Yeah, it's not like
talking with girls

1273
00:51:30,715 --> 00:51:33,386
or anything like that, right?

1274
00:51:33,421 --> 00:51:35,520
Hell you're talking about?

1275
00:51:35,555 --> 00:51:38,523
Well, I was just wondering

1276
00:51:38,558 --> 00:51:40,459
if I help you with dominoes,

1277
00:51:41,792 --> 00:51:44,793
maybe you can help
me learn about women?

1278
00:51:44,828 --> 00:51:46,432
Oh, shucks.

1279
00:51:46,467 --> 00:51:47,763
Hormones raging, huh?

1280
00:51:49,602 --> 00:51:54,308
Okay, ain't nothing
more beautiful in life

1281
00:51:54,343 --> 00:51:56,244
than finding the
love of a good woman

1282
00:51:57,643 --> 00:51:58,675
'cause you'll never
be able to find one

1283
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:00,281
half as good as mine

1284
00:52:00,316 --> 00:52:01,711
'cause my Ella May
was the greatest woman

1285
00:52:01,746 --> 00:52:03,614
that ever graced
this green earth.

1286
00:52:03,649 --> 00:52:06,188
Having love is like pure magic.

1287
00:52:08,753 --> 00:52:10,291
There's no greater feeling.

1288
00:52:12,493 --> 00:52:15,692
Losing it is like a
repeated kick in the ass

1289
00:52:15,727 --> 00:52:17,595
with a steel toed boot.

1290
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:21,401
That damn Tenspeed got her ring.

1291
00:52:21,436 --> 00:52:23,568
That's the only memory
of her I got left.

1292
00:52:24,637 --> 00:52:26,736
I don't wanna lose it for life.

1293
00:52:26,771 --> 00:52:28,606
Not while I'm still half alive.

1294
00:52:30,478 --> 00:52:33,215
He beat him in the losing
in last tournament.

1295
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:35,283
We got to win it back.

1296
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:36,746
All right, let's get it back.

1297
00:52:38,486 --> 00:52:42,488
But what you were
talking about with girls,

1298
00:52:42,523 --> 00:52:44,655
I think I found my Ella May.

1299
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:47,691
Look, we don't have
a lot of time left,

1300
00:52:47,726 --> 00:52:50,793
so we're gonna have to do
a crash course, all right?

1301
00:52:50,828 --> 00:52:52,333
Two things I'ma give you.

1302
00:52:53,402 --> 00:52:56,898
A, [indistinct whispering]

1303
00:52:56,933 --> 00:52:58,966
[chuckles]

1304
00:52:59,001 --> 00:53:01,738
And lastly, about you
random motherfuckers

1305
00:53:01,773 --> 00:53:03,377
who are definitely gonna lose.

1306
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:06,776
[exclaims loudly]

1307
00:53:06,811 --> 00:53:08,679
It looks like Gerald
Edges has finally decided

1308
00:53:08,714 --> 00:53:10,846
to come on through and play.

1309
00:53:10,881 --> 00:53:11,847
[sighs]

1310
00:53:11,882 --> 00:53:12,716
[chuckles softly]

1311
00:53:12,751 --> 00:53:13,519
Uncle Ben.

1312
00:53:14,852 --> 00:53:17,259
Did you just climb
out of your rice box?

1313
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:18,689
Man. I want all these
beautiful people

1314
00:53:18,724 --> 00:53:20,724
to watch me whoop your ass.

1315
00:53:20,759 --> 00:53:22,957
And there ain't gon' be no
sympathy here Papa Bones.

1316
00:53:22,992 --> 00:53:25,729
Although, I would like
to formally thank you

1317
00:53:25,764 --> 00:53:28,303
for the invention
of peanut butter.

1318
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:29,700
That shit is good as fuck.

1319
00:53:29,735 --> 00:53:32,439
Especially with jelly, goddam.

1320
00:53:32,474 --> 00:53:33,836
George
Washington[indistinct]looking ass.

1321
00:53:33,871 --> 00:53:35,409
Lemme tell you what.

1322
00:53:35,444 --> 00:53:36,542
What?

1323
00:53:36,577 --> 00:53:38,005
Get on up, so we can get down.

1324
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,974
Oh man. What was
that from the 50s?

1325
00:53:40,009 --> 00:53:41,745
Goddam, get on up
so we can get down.

1326
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:43,879
There were no cars
when you was born, sir.

1327
00:53:43,914 --> 00:53:45,386
All right, all
right, all right.

1328
00:53:45,421 --> 00:53:47,289
About to play some dominoes.

1329
00:53:47,324 --> 00:53:48,554
And no sore losers up in here.

1330
00:53:48,589 --> 00:53:49,753
Y'all got it?

1331
00:53:49,788 --> 00:53:51,425
Let's keep it cute, Compton.

1332
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:53,757
Let's get it.

1333
00:53:53,792 --> 00:53:55,495
[sighs softly]

1334
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:57,024
I'm about to tear your ass up.

1335
00:53:57,059 --> 00:53:58,366
Come on with
the big six again.

1336
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:00,599
Is this sponsored by ARP?

1337
00:54:00,634 --> 00:54:02,370
Got you right there.

1338
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:03,932
[sighs softly]

1339
00:54:03,967 --> 00:54:04,999
Come on.

1340
00:54:05,034 --> 00:54:05,868
What you got?

1341
00:54:05,903 --> 00:54:06,770
Nickel.

1342
00:54:07,905 --> 00:54:08,838
Nickel.

1343
00:54:11,612 --> 00:54:12,941
Alfred Lord Tennyson.

1344
00:54:13,878 --> 00:54:15,251
What the fuck that is.

1345
00:54:16,815 --> 00:54:18,980
How does that feel, Gerald?

1346
00:54:19,015 --> 00:54:20,586
Painful?

1347
00:54:20,621 --> 00:54:22,489
Do you got your
arthritis acting up?

1348
00:54:22,524 --> 00:54:26,823
Oh, a dumb ass mistake
from Gerald Edges.

1349
00:54:26,858 --> 00:54:28,396
He must be getting old

1350
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:31,300
or is it that
dementia kicking in?

1351
00:54:31,335 --> 00:54:32,400
What's wrong pops?

1352
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:33,434
Come on man.

1353
00:54:35,834 --> 00:54:37,933
Ah, that's right.

1354
00:54:37,968 --> 00:54:41,035
Circle of life Mufasa, the old
clearing out for the young.

1355
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:42,608
Your time is up.

1356
00:54:42,643 --> 00:54:44,071
[humming]

1357
00:54:44,106 --> 00:54:46,843
[laughs loudly]

1358
00:54:48,814 --> 00:54:50,979
Go get this ass whooping boy.

1359
00:54:51,014 --> 00:54:52,651
[laughs loudly]

1360
00:54:52,686 --> 00:54:56,688
Yeah, legendary Tenspeed.

1361
00:54:56,723 --> 00:54:59,460
Yeah, I heard about
your motherfucking ass.

1362
00:54:59,495 --> 00:55:00,494
Guess what?

1363
00:55:00,529 --> 00:55:01,924
What's that?

1364
00:55:01,959 --> 00:55:03,794
I ain't scared
of your bitch ass.

1365
00:55:03,829 --> 00:55:06,060
My momma told me all about you.

1366
00:55:06,095 --> 00:55:08,502
You ain't nothing but a
motherfucking crack head.

1367
00:55:08,537 --> 00:55:10,603
All this time I've been
fucking your mama nigga

1368
00:55:10,638 --> 00:55:12,539
it's the first time she
telling you about me bitch?

1369
00:55:12,574 --> 00:55:14,035
And it should have been your
daddy that told you about me

1370
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:15,377
motherfucker.

1371
00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:16,510
And just don't disrespect me

1372
00:55:16,545 --> 00:55:17,643
with an unlit cigarette

1373
00:55:17,678 --> 00:55:19,106
and you taught me to cocaine?

1374
00:55:19,141 --> 00:55:21,075
What the fuck crack head
cocaine do many things.

1375
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:22,681
I do cocaine motherfucker.

1376
00:55:22,716 --> 00:55:24,111
I do the finest shit
in the Peruvian.

1377
00:55:24,146 --> 00:55:25,948
Come on, I defeat
everything I do.

1378
00:55:25,983 --> 00:55:27,620
And next time I fuck your mama,

1379
00:55:27,655 --> 00:55:29,457
I'ma tell her to keep
your ass in the house.

1380
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:31,052
10.

1381
00:55:31,087 --> 00:55:32,658
15.

1382
00:55:32,693 --> 00:55:33,791
First of all, I didn't
hear shit you said.

1383
00:55:33,826 --> 00:55:35,694
Is your mustache too big?

1384
00:55:35,729 --> 00:55:36,893
And I will suck your bitch ass
but you ain't gonna feel it.

1385
00:55:36,928 --> 00:55:38,499
Oh you're a genius, huh?

1386
00:55:38,534 --> 00:55:39,962
You real slick with your
motherfucking mouth.

1387
00:55:39,997 --> 00:55:41,568
Let me tell you something

1388
00:55:41,603 --> 00:55:42,998
you little irrelevant
motherfucker.

1389
00:55:43,033 --> 00:55:44,604
20.

1390
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:46,067
It ain't never too
late for an abortion.

1391
00:55:46,102 --> 00:55:47,442
So you should shut
your goddam mouth.

1392
00:55:47,477 --> 00:55:48,641
You see what I'm saying?

1393
00:55:48,676 --> 00:55:50,104
What?

1394
00:55:50,139 --> 00:55:51,545
Dominoes, that's
what motherfucker.

1395
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:53,778
[screams loudly]

1396
00:55:53,813 --> 00:55:55,516
I'm about to tear your ass up.

1397
00:55:55,551 --> 00:55:58,046
46, 46 trombones
in the big parade.

1398
00:56:02,492 --> 00:56:03,755
It looks like
I spoke too soon.

1399
00:56:03,790 --> 00:56:04,987
Gerald is racking up points.

1400
00:56:05,022 --> 00:56:06,758
The fuck he is.

1401
00:56:06,793 --> 00:56:07,660
Very white.

1402
00:56:08,795 --> 00:56:09,860
The fu...

1403
00:56:09,895 --> 00:56:11,796
Two four, three five.

1404
00:56:11,831 --> 00:56:13,061
Hey.

1405
00:56:13,096 --> 00:56:14,601
Sorry, I have Tourette's.

1406
00:56:17,001 --> 00:56:17,901
Tickle that teat.

1407
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:20,101
Security, security.

1408
00:56:21,643 --> 00:56:23,038
Oysters.

1409
00:56:23,073 --> 00:56:25,678
Some kind of commotion
going on in the crowd.

1410
00:56:25,713 --> 00:56:27,779
We're gonna have the
monitors take a look.

1411
00:56:27,814 --> 00:56:30,045
25 big booty bitches bouncing.

1412
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:33,587
[domino bangs]

1413
00:56:33,622 --> 00:56:35,919
Shocker, shocker, doing
the pink, what a stink.

1414
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:40,495
Dominoes.

1415
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:41,661
Stop.

1416
00:56:46,602 --> 00:56:47,997
Tell your
grandmamma I said hey.

1417
00:56:48,032 --> 00:56:49,867
She'll remember me.

1418
00:56:49,902 --> 00:56:52,738
And a huge come from behind
victory from Gerald Edges.

1419
00:56:52,773 --> 00:56:54,641
Congratulations.

Ooh, Camilla Ines is looking
surprisingly shaky out there.

1424
00:57:02,948 --> 00:57:04,816
You know, I've been meaning
to ask you this all game.

1425
00:57:04,851 --> 00:57:06,752
Aside from the fact
that you are dressed

1426
00:57:06,787 --> 00:57:08,820
like Cleo from "Set It Off,"

1427
00:57:08,855 --> 00:57:10,118
how does it work when
you're in the bathroom?

1428
00:57:10,153 --> 00:57:11,724
Like are you standing up?

1429
00:57:11,759 --> 00:57:12,857
Are you sitting down?

1430
00:57:12,892 --> 00:57:13,858
Are you on there backwards?

1431
00:57:13,893 --> 00:57:15,497
What are you doing?

1432
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:16,795
Well, I'll be
standing only when

1433
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:18,566

Nasty.

1436
00:57:23,936 --> 00:57:25,738
You should make
sure you hold onto her

1437
00:57:25,773 --> 00:57:26,838
before you lose her.

1438
00:57:27,775 --> 00:57:29,038
Call her and shit.

Are you having a mental
breakdown right now?

1444
00:57:36,245 --> 00:57:39,015
Are you suffering
from identity crisis?

1445
00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:41,083
You wanna write your
feelings in your diary?

1446
00:57:41,118 --> 00:57:42,150
Huh?

1447

The thing you boys
forget about dominoes

1835
01:12:50,631 --> 01:12:54,600
is that the bones might
be hard and loud and cold

1836

Well everything seems normal

1897
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:04,059
but you have to take it easy.

1898
01:15:04,094 --> 01:15:06,567
No more fighting. Promise?

You promise to do
something for me?

1901
01:15:14,841 --> 01:15:17,677
But that is the
saddest I've ever seen.

We're in front of white

I mean, twists and turns,
drama around every corner.

1906
01:15:29,823 --> 01:15:32,087
This is gonna be good,

1907
01:15:32,122 --> 01:15:34,188
But I'm a hustler.

1908

Okay.

1914
01:15:44,871 --> 01:15:45,969
And I realize, you know,
you're on my property,

1915
01:15:46,004 --> 01:15:46,970
I haven't prayed for you.

1916
01:15:47,005 --> 01:15:48,103
Okay.

Now, somebody about to lose

01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:01,314
if I don't get my cash.

1922
01:16:02,317 --> 01:16:03,756
Okay, listen.

1923
01:16:06,893 --> 01:16:08,959
I can't, I tried, I
don't have the money.

1924
01:16:10,028 --> 01:16:11,797
Don't please, wait, wait, wait.

1925
01:16:11,832 --> 01:16:13,766
I don't even have
the prize money yet.

1926
01:16:15,099 --> 01:16:18,804
I'm hoping that this
film blows up, you know.

1927
01:16:18,839 --> 01:16:20,773
That's why I invited
the investors down

1928
01:16:20,808 --> 01:16:24,106
but I am 20 grand
in the hole myself.

1929
01:16:24,141 --> 01:16:26,009
- Oh, for real?
- Yeah.

1930
01:16:26,044 --> 01:16:27,648
That's some shit.

1931
01:16:27,683 --> 01:16:29,078
I'm desperate,
I'll do anything,

1932
01:16:29,113 --> 01:16:30,343
just give me a few
more hours, please.

1933
01:16:32,787 --> 01:16:34,820
So you want me to
give a few more hours?

1934
01:16:36,791 --> 01:16:39,924
Well, you, my friend are in luck

1935
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:46,326
because the Lord has anointed
me to get my certification

1936
01:16:47,263 --> 01:16:48,900
to be a same day lender.

1937
01:16:48,935 --> 01:16:50,869
Oh, that's convenient.

1938
01:16:50,904 --> 01:16:53,234
So you can sign right there

for the next 45 minutes.

- Yeah.

God is good.

1943
01:17:07,921 --> 01:17:09,789
Where's my money?

1944
01:17:10,990 --> 01:17:13,793
Oh, white Jesus.

1945
01:17:13,828 --> 01:17:15,289
That's your credit.

1946
01:17:15,324 --> 01:17:16,763
That's right, that's the savior,

1947
01:17:16,798 --> 01:17:18,292
He saved your ass today.

1948
01:17:18,327 --> 01:17:19,194
All right.

1949
01:17:20,296 --> 01:17:21,295
It's gonna be good.

1950
01:17:21,330 --> 01:17:23,099

some goddam twinkies.

1960
01:17:43,022 --> 01:17:45,792
You was a motherfucking
twinky gangster.

1961
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:46,925
[laughs]

1962
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:47,926
Nigga with the cream filling.

1963
01:17:49,996 --> 01:17:52,293
Then give me 15 while you
sitting there thinking.

1964
01:17:52,328 --> 01:17:54,064
Who the fuck
told you that shit?

1965
01:17:54,099 --> 01:17:55,428
Your grandmother.

1966
01:17:55,463 --> 01:17:57,265
She's a sweet lady.

1967
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:59,267
Grandma always talking shit.

1968
01:17:59,302 --> 01:18:01,137
Running her fucking mouth.

1969
01:18:01,172 --> 01:18:02,468
Hating ass bitch.

1970
01:18:02,503 --> 01:18:04,206
Still in that halfway house?

1971
01:18:07,475 --> 01:18:10,047
So tell me, when
did you get out?

1972
01:18:11,479 --> 01:18:14,084
I spend 175 days in the hole.

1973
01:18:14,119 --> 01:18:18,055
Nothing but darkness and the
sound of my own heartbeat,

1974
01:18:18,090 --> 01:18:20,090
blood sweeping through
my veins, homie.

1975
01:18:21,456 --> 01:18:23,027
Hey shit you can do

You like that, huh?

1980
01:18:30,036 --> 01:18:32,003
Congratulations on
your new relationship.

1981
01:18:32,038 --> 01:18:33,774
How the fuck you

1987
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:43,509
I fucked twice.

1988
01:18:43,544 --> 01:18:44,884
The pussy barely decent, you
shouldn't be getting that mad.

1989
01:18:44,919 --> 01:18:46,017
Uh Oh!

1990
01:18:46,052 --> 01:18:47,821
I can't hear what they're saying

1991
01:18:47,856 --> 01:18:49,955
but it looks like Tenspeed
found his opening.

1992
01:18:49,990 --> 01:18:51,418
Fuck you, nigga.

1993
01:18:51,453 --> 01:18:54,960

Listen nigga, get

01:19:00,396 --> 01:19:02,264
Calm down.

1997
01:19:02,299 --> 01:19:04,167
Everybody's neighborhood

1998
01:19:04,202 --> 01:19:06,169
Here, see, hold on, look

01:19:06,204 --> 01:19:07,775

2000

That was her in
church with her grandma.

2003

That was just at church.

2004
01:19:12,947 --> 01:19:14,177
Ain't that smile pretty?

This negro finna blow.

[Andy] Yeah?

2020
01:20:06,231 --> 01:20:07,967

01:20:11,434 --> 01:20:13,038
I'm outside on the steps.

Okay, cool, I'll

There you are.

2026

Everyone's worried about you.

2027
01:20:21,147 --> 01:20:22,949
I really doubt that.

2028
01:20:22,984 --> 01:20:26,084
Oh Andy, of course
they're worried about you.

2029
01:20:26,119 --> 01:20:28,251
You've become quite
the talk around here.

2030
01:20:30,255 --> 01:20:31,122
Damn!

2031
01:20:32,961 --> 01:20:34,961
A tragic loss for one of
the best to bang the bone.

2032
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:37,161
Everybody get the fuck down.

2033

Anybody wanna try some

2036
01:20:44,434 --> 01:20:45,532

2037
01:20:45,567 --> 01:20:47,204
Damn, I need a better agent.

2038
01:20:47,239 --> 01:20:48,876

2039
01:20:50,209 --> 01:20:52,110

Hurry up.

2041
01:20:54,642 --> 01:20:57,148
Yeah, nigga, make a move and
I promise I started bursting.

2042
01:20:57,183 --> 01:20:58,578
Yeah, all right.

2043
01:20:58,613 --> 01:21:00,283
Put your hands in
the air fat wink wink.

2044
01:21:00,318 --> 01:21:01,922
Do some.

2045
01:21:01,957 --> 01:21:03,286
Get your tiny
ass on the ground.

2046
01:21:03,321 --> 01:21:04,518
Please, I have several
adult rescue cats.

2047
01:21:04,553 --> 01:21:05,651
Hand cuff yourself.

2048
01:21:05,686 --> 01:21:07,587
Everybody is scared except me.

2049
01:21:07,622 --> 01:21:08,588
I ain't scared of shit.

2050
01:21:08,623 --> 01:21:09,589
Hurry the fuck up.

2051
01:21:09,624 --> 01:21:10,964
Ah, I'm trying.

2052
01:21:10,999 --> 01:21:12,361
Yeah, that figures.

2053
01:21:12,396 --> 01:21:14,528
Sad, lonely white kid
that nobody loves.

2054
01:21:14,563 --> 01:21:16,200
I'm sure they're all laughing.

2055
01:21:17,269 --> 01:21:19,533
You know I'm different too.

2056
01:21:19,568 --> 01:21:22,404
When I first came here, it
was hard for me to fit in.

2057
01:21:22,439 --> 01:21:24,912
People judge me by my outside.

2058
01:21:24,947 --> 01:21:29,048
But you know, you can't
judge a book by its cover.

2059
01:21:29,083 --> 01:21:30,181
You just can't
always see through

2060
01:21:30,216 --> 01:21:32,480
the rough exterior sometimes.

2061
01:21:32,515 --> 01:21:35,351
My parents don't
even care about me.

2062
01:21:35,386 --> 01:21:37,353
They're too busy focusing
on their own lives

2063
01:21:37,388 --> 01:21:39,289
and Cabo or whatever.

2064
01:21:39,324 --> 01:21:42,358
I'm sure that's
not true, not really.

2065
01:21:42,393 --> 01:21:46,164
Like your granddad, they
may be distracted sometimes,

2066
01:21:46,199 --> 01:21:48,903
but people tend to come
around when the dust settles.

2067
01:21:51,732 --> 01:21:53,303
You think so?

2068
01:21:53,338 --> 01:21:56,405
I do, family's
for life after all.

2071
01:22:02,446 --> 01:22:03,610
Move it here.

2072
01:22:03,645 --> 01:22:05,282
Fill the fucking
bag [indistinct]

2073
01:22:05,317 --> 01:22:06,580
Fuck you're looking at.

2074
01:22:06,615 --> 01:22:08,186
Trick or treat mother fucker.

2075
01:22:08,221 --> 01:22:10,386
This is [indistinct]

2076
01:22:10,421 --> 01:22:13,488
I think you might be the
first real friend I've ever had.

2077
01:22:13,523 --> 01:22:17,261
Well, I doubt that, but I
am definitely your friend now.

2078
01:22:17,296 --> 01:22:20,330
So what do you say we
get back in there...

2079
01:22:20,365 --> 01:22:22,970
Namita, can I
ask you a question?

2080
01:22:25,667 --> 01:22:27,073
Do you have a boyfriend?

2081
01:22:27,108 --> 01:22:28,536
And what's reverse cow girl?

2082
01:22:28,571 --> 01:22:32,309
Is it like a
time-traveling lady cowboy?

2083
01:22:35,215 --> 01:22:37,050
I'm going to time travel

2084
01:22:37,085 --> 01:22:39,580
and pretend that last three
seconds never happened.

2085
01:22:41,386 --> 01:22:43,584
Right now, we need to get
back to check on your grandad.

2086
01:22:43,619 --> 01:22:47,390
He had an accident trying
to defend your honor

2087
01:22:47,425 --> 01:22:48,721
against Tenspeed.

2088
01:22:48,756 --> 01:22:49,689
Where is he?

2089
01:22:49,724 --> 01:22:51,328
Is he okay?

2090
01:22:51,363 --> 01:22:52,593
Tenspeed better
not have hurt him.

2091
01:22:52,628 --> 01:22:53,495
Let's go.

2092
01:22:57,567 --> 01:22:59,732
Anybody else got
something to say?

2093
01:22:59,767 --> 01:23:01,437
And who the fuck is you?

2094
01:23:01,472 --> 01:23:03,736
Get the fuck in here.

2095
01:23:03,771 --> 01:23:05,375
Huh?

2096
01:23:05,410 --> 01:23:06,574
And get the fuck over there,

2097
01:23:06,609 --> 01:23:08,180
you hear the fuck I'm saying?

2098
01:23:12,285 --> 01:23:14,549
There's a fucking gun,

01:23:19,655 --> 01:23:21,325
Grab the fucking hook.

2100

Everybody stay in here.

Not in my house, they're
not gonna stop my dreams.

2119
01:24:17,647 --> 01:24:20,186
Look, what just happened
was a horrible experience.

2120
01:24:20,221 --> 01:24:23,519
And I'm sure it's gonna
cost me thousands more

2121
01:24:23,554 --> 01:24:25,785
in medication, therapy,

2122
01:24:27,294 --> 01:24:29,129
which I absolutely do not have.

2123
01:24:31,859 --> 01:24:35,366
But just stop for a second
and think about it, okay?

2124
01:24:35,401 --> 01:24:38,303
Listen, some of you paid
a perfectly reasonable,

2125
01:24:38,338 --> 01:24:41,141
but not minuscule price
to be in this tournament.

2126
01:24:42,540 --> 01:24:44,738
And some of you spent
your hard-earned money

2127
01:24:44,773 --> 01:24:48,676
to come out here and see the
world's best dominoes players

2128
01:24:48,711 --> 01:24:50,117
go for the grand prize.

2129
01:24:50,152 --> 01:24:53,450
$10,000, $10,000

2130
01:24:53,485 --> 01:24:55,452
that has still not been claimed.

2131
01:24:55,487 --> 01:24:56,651
I have it right here.

2132
01:24:59,722 --> 01:25:04,197
Now, are you seriously
willing to walk away

2133
01:25:04,232 --> 01:25:05,396
from what we've started?

2134
01:25:07,202 --> 01:25:08,795
What we're part of?

2135
01:25:08,830 --> 01:25:10,698
History.

2136
01:25:10,733 --> 01:25:12,898
Just because a couple of
trick ass gangsters choose

2137
01:25:12,933 --> 01:25:15,175
to disrupt our championship?

2138
01:25:16,277 --> 01:25:18,178
Fuck those guys.

2139
01:25:18,213 --> 01:25:19,872
Fuck those guys.

2140
01:25:19,907 --> 01:25:22,314
Now, who are the
winners in this place?

2141
01:25:22,349 --> 01:25:23,315
Huh?

2142
01:25:23,350 --> 01:25:25,845
Is it us or is it them?

2143
01:25:27,651 --> 01:25:31,554
'Cause I went on a search all
through South Los Angeles,

2144
01:25:31,589 --> 01:25:35,723
terrifying journey to
find the best of the best.

2145

And those are the winners
that stand before you today.

2146

And for one of you,

2147
01:25:44,701 --> 01:25:48,637

[Police Officer]
Oh, I don't think

2168
01:26:41,956 --> 01:26:43,626

- There's white people here.

2169

Are you okay?

2176
01:26:57,345 --> 01:26:59,741
I don't know what
I would have done.

2177
01:26:59,776 --> 01:27:00,874
If they'd hurt you.

2178

It's actually the only time

I've been able to
be who I really am.

2184
01:27:22,568 --> 01:27:27,571

maybe this is not for me.

01:28:46,113 --> 01:28:49,048
I gotta say, Walter, what

01:28:49,083 --> 01:28:50,049
- Real, right?

2201
01:28:50,084 --> 01:28:51,688
Quite the experience.

Yeah a bit too
real for my blood,

What work, sir?

Well, you guys as

reality television

2209

2219
01:29:35,162 --> 01:29:36,931
Why are you gonna do
one cheap promo piece,

2220
01:29:36,966 --> 01:29:41,969
when you can get hours
of ad sponsored footage

2221
01:29:43,038 --> 01:29:44,741
for a reality television show?

2222
01:29:44,776 --> 01:29:45,775
I see it.

2223
01:29:45,810 --> 01:29:46,908

01:30:14,168 --> 01:30:17,070
Mr. Edges, I heard
you're sick, are you okay?

2242
01:30:19,041 --> 01:30:21,481
You just took down a
crazy ass bitch with a gun

2243
01:30:21,516 --> 01:30:22,713
and you worried about me?

2244

Well, yeah, I saw you

But ain't nothing wrong
with my heart boy.

2250

This is nothing this little
pills can take care of.

I ain't got it no more.

2252

ain't no more time
in this game for me.

2256
01:31:08,695 --> 01:31:10,156

Against the world

He's gonna roll over
and crush me though.
