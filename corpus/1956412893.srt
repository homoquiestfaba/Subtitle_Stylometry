00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,278
Shoplifting couple of times.

367
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,653
If that ain't anti-Semite.

368
00:20:35,605 --> 00:20:37,272
You're not Jewish.

369
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,680
So what can I get you?

370
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,888
Listen, kid.

371
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:45,868
You think you can run to the
OTB place a few bets for me?

372
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,848
Why, you get banned from there too?

373
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,453
That one was complete BS.

374
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,253
Yeah, the food here is terrible.

375
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,980
Best to just stick with the soup.

376
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,588
So let me know when
the next appointment is...

377
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,740
Don't worry about it.

378
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,081
You sure?

379
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,128
I said don't worry about it.

380
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,038
I'm a big boy.

381
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,288
If I need to get there,
I'll figure it out.

382
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,123
Okay, but.

383
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:37,678
Do you wanna know what this is?

384
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,868
Yeah, you?

385
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:41,863
It's a G.

386
00:21:41,865 --> 00:21:43,913
At least I think it's a G.

387
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:47,473
I've only had two lessons.

388
00:21:47,475 --> 00:21:49,458
Mia, don't be terrorizing the building.

389
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,608
Go practice in your room.

390
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,948
- Hi.
- Hi.

391
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:55,223
Hi, hey, how was the doctor?

392
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:57,008
Weird.

393
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:57,841
Yeah.

394
00:21:57,843 --> 00:22:01,413
Well, I mean, it's so kind
that you're taking him.

395
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,720
I don't think he needs me.

396
00:22:04,648 --> 00:22:08,018
Well, everyone needs someone, right?

397
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:12,163
I mean to say I don't
think that he wants me.

398
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:15,915
Probably means that
he needs you even more.

00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,608
PETER: When is your next appointment?

401
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:27,443
Thursday.

402
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,398
We're eating someplace else.

403
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,233
No we're not!

(GENTLE MUSIC)

405
00:23:09,582 --> 00:23:11,195
Are you with Mr. Steele?

406
00:23:11,197 --> 00:23:12,697
- Yes.
- Come on back please.

407
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,850
Is he almost ready?

408
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:22,875
Yes, they're finishing
up with him right now.

409
00:23:22,877 --> 00:23:24,688
He should be out shortly.

410
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:27,198
I just wanted to address a few

411
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,578
concerns we have regarding his treatment.

412
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,588
Do you know if he's been taking
his medication on a regular?

413
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,578
No.

414
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,062
No, he hasn't, or no you don't know?

415
00:23:36,064 --> 00:23:38,758
(PEOPLE CHATTING DISTANTLY)

416
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,148
What about his diet?

417
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,827
How about that how's that been?

418
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:45,728
Mister?

419
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:48,238
Steele, you can call me Peter please.

420
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,408
Mr. Steele how long has it been

421
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:52,528
since you last saw your uncle?

422
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:53,857
Years.

423
00:23:53,859 --> 00:23:55,748
Are you familiar with
Acute Myeloid Leukemia?

424
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,958
Just from the pamphlet in the lobby.

425
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,498
Well, I'm afraid we're past

426
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,538
the point of treating his disease,

427
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,378
and now we're in a course of
pain and symptom management.

428
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,213
He's terminal?

429
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,398
I like to put it this way.

430
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,138
We're reshaping what
time he does have left.

431
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,608
How much time is that?

432
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,138
Well, that's where it gets tricky.

433
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,938
If he takes his medication,
comes to his treatments,

434
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,498
and stays relatively healthy,

435
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,068
he might have a year or more.

436
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:19,548
But if he's not taking
his treatment seriously,

437
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,698
there's simply no one of
telling what he's in for.

438
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,543
I appreciate that.

439
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,968
But I don't know how to
communicate with my uncle.

440
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:30,038
I don't know how to talk to him,

441
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,948
and even if I did, I'm
pretty sure he wouldn't talk.

442
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,678
Mr. Steele, I'm not here to judge.

443
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,828
I'm certainly not in a position to have

444
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:38,628
a philosophical debate
about how he lives his life.

445
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:41,398
I just thought I'd try to
enlist your help on our side.

446
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,228
I mean no disrespect,
but how do you know

447
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:45,080
how he should approach his treatment?

448
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:48,068
I understand, Mr. Steele.

449
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,428
I just thought it
warranted your attention.

450
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:52,293
How about bone marrow?

451
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,468
Bone marrow?

452
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:57,358
I read in the pamphlet
that there is treatments.

453
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,138
I'm afraid we're past that option.

454
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:02,413
Could I have been a
donor as a relative of his?

455
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,948
We would've started there.

456
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,478
You know, I have some
information in the lobby that

457
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,588
explains all that to you, you
want me to grab it for you?

458
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,533
No, there's no point.

459
00:25:17,786 --> 00:25:20,369
You always breathe like that?

460
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,148
You know, you can talk.

461
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,383
You can talk to me.

462
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:39,138
Do you really think you're dying?

463
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,040
FRANK: Okay, we don't need to talk.

464
00:25:44,149 --> 00:25:47,688
I mean, does it feel like you're dying?

465
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:50,538
That's what I've been told many times.

466
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,238
Do you believe it?

467
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,753
I feel like shit everyday.

468
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,478
Some days worse than others.

469
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,663
I realized one thing.

470
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:02,373
I am going to die sooner
rather than later.

471
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,808
You talk to anybody other it?

472
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:09,643
Your father.

473
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:12,798
Did he say anything?

474
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,668
Your father had qualities.

475
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:17,763
Emotional support wasn't one of them.

476
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,453
I think, we all have those moments.

477
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,238
What do you mean?

478
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,750
When you're lying there
staring at the ceiling

479
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,628
wondering how it's gonna end.

480
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,068
Is this it?

481
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,720
Is this the beginning of the end?

482
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,493
Or am I thinking that because
I don't know what's next?

483
00:26:42,162 --> 00:26:44,518
Maybe you're the one that
needs to get checked out.

484
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,363
When the end comes, I'll know it.

485
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,038
You seem very sure of yourself.

486
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,590
And I hate it when I'm right.

487
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,568
Is there anything I could do?

488
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,235
- No.
- Can I do anything for you?

489
00:26:55,237 --> 00:26:57,888
No, I'm pretty wiped
out after these things,

490
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,190
and I just wanna lay down.

491

Can you? (SIGHING)

494
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,133
What?

495
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:10,178
(SIGHING) The medicine they give me.

496
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:13,453
I hate it, and they want me
to take it like every night.

497
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:15,848
It's supposed to help with the bruising

498
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:18,978
and the clotting and
staving off infection.

499
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:19,811
That's good.

500
00:27:19,813 --> 00:27:22,130
No, it makes me sweat
like a whore in church.

501
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,238
My sheets.

502
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,123
Say no more.

503
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,848
Please.

504
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,858
It'll just be a few more days.

505
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,008
I will text you the house number,

506
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:35,403
and you could forward all calls there.

507
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:38,500
Thank you, Stephanie.

00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:40,828
- Hi.
- Hi.

509
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,898
Hi, again.

510
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,868
You're still at it.

511
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,913
Well, yeah.

512
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:48,798
She has this lucky pair of socks now,

513
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,468
and she has to wear them every
time she has a math test.

514
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,513
She has a math test tomorrow, so.

515
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:57,418
I use to have an owl shirt that I loved.

516
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,970
First thing I wore out
of the wash every time.

517
00:27:58,972 --> 00:28:01,028
(CHUCKING) So you understand the gravity

518
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:02,928
of this situation.

519
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,978
Kids are so weird.

520
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,083

Mrs. Sloan?

522
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:22,218
Mrs. Sloan, this man
was using that machine.

523
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,808
Doesn't look like it.

524
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:26,258
He's standing in front
of it with laundry.

525
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,660
What else would he be doing?

526
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:30,788
Maybe he was taking his
clothes out of the machine?

527
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:31,623
He's not.

528
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,688
Do you even live here?

529
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:36,208
He's helping Frank.

530
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,051
Do you know Frank?

531
00:28:37,053 --> 00:28:38,108
He's on the fourth floor.

532
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:40,258
He's really, really sick.

533
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,708
He's helping him out
he's doing his laundry.

534

Isn't that so nice, you know,

what it's all about, right?

We are the world.

538
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,048
We are the children.

00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:01,863
Bye, Mrs. Sloan, have a great day.

540
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:07,918
Thank you for saving me
from the sweet looking lady.

541
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,298
Oh, no problem.

542
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,228
Mrs. Sloan has just
approved of my existence

543
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,591
ever since the single mother moved in

544
00:29:13,593 --> 00:29:16,598

00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:47,328
whatever I'm thinking
about, that I don't remember

905
00:44:47,330 --> 00:44:49,668
if I washed my face yet or not.

906
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:53,058
So I'll stand there,
water beading down on me

907
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:57,868
for five whole minutes,
debating with myself

908
00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:01,408
whether or not I should wash my face again

909
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:03,998
if I hadn't, in fact, washed it before

910
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,788
or if I should get out of the shower

911
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:08,597
not having washed my face at all.

912
00:45:12,746 --> 00:45:14,999
That was the worst.

913
00:45:15,001 --> 00:45:18,496
That was the worst.

914
00:45:18,498 --> 00:45:19,329
That was the worst.

915
00:45:19,331 --> 00:45:22,518
Yeah, I just bared my soul to you.

916
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:25,208
I just told you about
raising a kid on my own

917
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:30,210
and about my thwarted dreams
of being an art teacher.

918
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:35,068
You are telling me about washing your face

919
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:37,543
or not washing your face in the shower.

920
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:41,263
It's not my fault you went first.

921
00:45:44,086 --> 00:45:46,998
How did you know that's so weird.

922
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,918
So, when do you sleep usually?

923
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,573
I don't usually.

924
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:54,658
Do you wanna hear the routine?

925
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:55,573
- Yes.
- Okay.

926
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:00,686
I get Mia off to school at 7:45.

927
00:46:00,688 --> 00:46:02,288
I get a couple of hours in then.

928
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:06,758
Then I do the phone for a couple hours.

929
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,338
Then I'll do some housework or whatever

930
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:10,758
until she gets back, and then she's back.

931
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,598
So we do her homework.

932
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,648
We watch a TV show together.

933
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:17,628
We eat dinner, bath,
story, bedtime routine.

934
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:18,668
Get her off to bed.

935
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:21,768
Put my little headset
on that's for dialing.

936
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:23,501
I'll try to squeeze in a
couple more hours of sleep then

937
00:46:23,503 --> 00:46:27,023
because she wakes up for
breakfast hit or mess.

938
00:46:27,878 --> 00:46:28,723
- Wow.
- Yeah.

939
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:32,498
I know, I've moved
further and further away

940
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:35,548
from any kind of normal routine
the longer I've done this.

941
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:36,728
You're doing it.

942
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:38,373
You're on your terms together.

943
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:41,780
Yeah, I don't know.

944
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:48,208
I wish I could say that this
was all some conscience act

945
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:53,118
of defiance to choose to live
outside the mainstream thing.

946
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:56,443
Whatever, but this is just the job I have.

947
00:46:57,337 --> 00:46:59,037
Most of the time I'm on autopilot.

948
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:01,738
You're on a different level.

949
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:03,828
You're making decisions
for another person.

950
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:05,128
I don't even make decisions.

951
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:07,468
I'm just carrying out actions,

952
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:10,238
muscle memory: eat, sleep, work,

953
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,263
that shower thing I told you about.

954
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,158
No one tells me to do anything.

955
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,783
But, what am I doing?

956
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,273
I'm impressed.

957
00:47:22,835 --> 00:47:24,933
Believe me, I make it look very hard.

958
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:32,238
I make enough to pay
rent to keep our place,

959
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,668
and then my parents pay her
tuition at Catholic school.

960
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:38,116
And once a year they'll take
us on a little vacation.

961
00:47:38,118 --> 00:47:39,458
That sounds nice.

962
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:40,698
Yeah.

963
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,000
Yeah, it actually is nice.

964
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,658
Most of the time I'm able to look past how

965
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:48,443
disappointing the state of
affairs is for all of us.

966
00:47:49,723 --> 00:47:52,478
We did not envision this as our set up.

967
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,688
Your daughter has people who love her.

968
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:56,240
Someone's always there for her.

969
00:47:57,310 --> 00:47:58,143
Yeah.

970
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:00,648
A lot of nights though I end up

971
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:04,328
just wide awake watching shitty TV

972
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:09,330
or staring at my computer
screen or whatever.

973
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:14,493
I find 3:00 to 5:00 a.m.
to be a difficult time.

974
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,240
I'm back at my father's house.

975
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:21,868
I'm sleeping in my childhood bedroom.

976
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:22,703
It's creepy.

977
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:25,940
I can't seem to get to sleep.

978
00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:28,750
But for some reason I keep going back.

979
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,088
You grew up here?

980
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:33,363
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

981
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:35,983
And I moved.

982
00:48:37,946 --> 00:48:39,748
And?

983
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:43,843
And, my mother died when I was nine.

984
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:46,570
So it was just my father and I.

985
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:50,048
We'd see Uncle Frank
on holidays sometimes,

986
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:52,750
but for the most part it was
just me and David Steele.

987
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:55,678
He pretended to keep
it together pretty well

988
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,963
until I was about 11.

989
00:48:58,787 --> 00:49:01,168
It wasn't happy, but it wasn't bad.

990
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:02,908
We greeted each other.

991
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:04,913
We exchanged pleasantries.

992
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,058
When I think about it now,

993
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:09,568
I shouldn't have taken it personally

994
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:13,678
because he was just
dealing with everything,

995
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,853
this new world without
her, as best that he could.

996
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:18,983
But I did.

997
00:49:20,247 --> 00:49:21,297
I took it personally.

998
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:25,658
When I was 13, we openly
acknowledged the fact that

999
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:27,128
the house was a miserable place to be

1000
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,568
especially when we were both there,

1001
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:31,208
and so he instituted a new rule.

1002
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:33,295
You don't have to come home on Fridays.

1003
00:49:33,297 --> 00:49:36,578
"In fact, don't come home on Fridays"

1004
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:37,588
that's how he said it.

1005
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:41,813
And it seemed like a
good idea at the time.

1006
00:49:42,792 --> 00:49:45,023
You know, we both were looking
for something like that.

1007
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:48,858
So, I had this one friend,
this one good friend,

1008
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:52,758
this one friend, Matt Rockcamp.

1009
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:55,858
We were the tech guys in the school play.

1010
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,388
We'd do the soundboard and the line board

1011
00:49:57,390 --> 00:49:58,540
and all those switches.

1012
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:03,738
And we had play rehearsals
on Saturday mornings.

1013
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:05,863
So Friday like clockwork,

1014
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:08,870
we'd go to Matt's house after school.

1015
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:14,720
We'd watch Monty Python
movies and order pizza

1016
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:17,698
and sometimes we'd sleep
on the screened in porch

1017
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:18,533
that he had.

1018
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:22,088
In the morning, Mrs. R
would wake up and make us

1019
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:26,073
bacon and eggs and these
homemade cinnamon rolls,

1020
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,898
not even from the can.

1021
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,433
You could put on all the icing you wanted.

1022
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,728
When I have any fun inkling of that age,

1023
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:36,880
that's what I think of.

1024
00:50:38,153 --> 00:50:40,608
But, of course, the
worse is when I went home

1025
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:42,013
after play practice.

1026
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,740
My father would smoke these cigars

1027
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:51,143
and always have the TV glaring
like four bars too loud.

1028
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:54,418
I remember getting in the front door

1029
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:57,218
and catching that smell and hearing the TV

1030
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,423
and just being so sad
that I was back home.

1031
00:51:01,456 --> 00:51:03,118
Then the only thing
that was actually worse

1032
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,220
was when I'd get home and he wasn't there.

1033
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,808
And then Saturdays turn into Sundays.

1034
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:09,798
And Sundays turned into Wednesdays.

1035
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,083
And he was gone more and more.

1036
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:20,203
Now Frank is dying of cancer.

1037
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:26,683
And Matt Rockcamp I heard
that he moved to Seattle,

1038
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:28,980
and he's an architect now.

1039
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:35,668
I think, you're doing a really good job

1040
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:36,770
with that little girl.

1041
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:44,845
I can't believe you
told me that shower story

1042
00:51:44,847 --> 00:51:49,847
while you were sitting on that.

this apartment building.

I like invent reasons
to leave the building.

1050
00:52:06,553 --> 00:52:10,148
I go to the store, get
something I already have,

1051
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:13,143
or go to the Post Office for new stamps.

1052
00:52:15,744 --> 00:52:17,128
I don't know I take Mia to the park.

1053
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:19,373
She doesn't even like
going to the park anymore.

1054
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:22,470
I'd go to the park.

- No.
- Sorry to just say that.

I just wanted to be direct

1061

because I feel like Mia's upstairs,

and if she were to hear us come in.

1063

01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:05,323
See, you take your money.

1255
01:01:06,484 --> 01:01:10,048
You take your big bill, your five.

1256
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:12,448
Then you wrap the ones around it.

1257
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:13,555
This way when people see it,

1258
01:01:13,557 --> 01:01:14,905
they think you only got a dollar.

1259
01:01:14,907 --> 01:01:16,728
Otherwise they see a big bill,

1260
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:18,883
they'd knock you on the
head and they'd take it.

1261

Mom, are they really gonna knock me

1262

It's good, huh?

1269
01:01:46,503 --> 01:01:48,798
When I was a little boy,

1270
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:50,408
I use to come here with my brother

1271
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:52,826
and we would dig them out of
the wet sand and eat 'em raw.

1272
01:01:52,828 --> 01:01:54,208
Ew, really?

1273
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:56,238
Oh, yeah, it's the best way to eat 'em.

1274
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,118
One day couple of years ago I was digging,

1275
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,868
and this bozo comes up to me.

1276
01:01:59,870 --> 01:02:02,795
He says, "The fishing rights
on this beach are protected,

1277
01:02:02,797 --> 01:02:04,788
"and you can't do that."

1278
01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:06,085
So I said, "Oh, yeah.

1279
01:02:06,087 --> 01:02:07,158

What did you do?

1283
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:14,233
I stopped.

1284
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:16,311
Well, that's good.

1285
01:02:16,313 --> 01:02:18,573
You wouldn't wanna get in trouble.

What's going on with him?

1287
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:32,768
He didn't go to treatment this morning.

1288
01:02:32,770 --> 01:02:34,570
He said he doesn't wanna go anymore.

MELANIE: Sorry.

1290
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,550
Then he told me to leave.

1291
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:41,588
So you grabbed him and
brought him to the beach?

1292
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:43,158
No, I left.

1293
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:44,310
And then you came back.

1294
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:47,668

- I get that.
- Believe me,

1298
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:52,978
he's said that earlier.

1299
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:54,630
You have to let him choose now,

1300
01:02:55,610 --> 01:02:57,158

1301
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:58,435

Why does he get to choose?

1303
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:00,760
Because it's his life.

1304

He's my family.

1305
01:03:04,671 --> 01:03:06,171
Can I stand idly by and watch?

1306
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:11,643
I think, it's time maybe for
you to start saying goodbye.

like you wanna save the day.

Remember what I told you about
how when the end is coming,

1434
01:11:02,726 --> 01:11:03,826
I think, I'll know it?

1435
01:11:07,328 --> 01:11:08,373
And what did I say?

1436
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,178

I don't know.

01:11:18,334 --> 01:11:19,784
It just hit me the other day.

1440
01:11:22,230 --> 01:11:24,780
I didn't know what to do,
so I called the hospital.

1441
01:11:26,206 --> 01:11:27,903
I couldn't think of anything else.

1442
01:11:35,230 --> 01:11:36,063
Hey.

1443
01:11:36,910 --> 01:11:37,743
Frank.

1444
01:11:39,333 --> 01:11:40,233
Frank, look at me.

01:12:21,790 --> 01:12:24,246
No, I just need to.

1453
01:12:24,248 --> 01:12:26,248
I just need to sit down.

Yeah, I can go and get that.

1464
01:13:03,310 --> 01:13:04,463
I guess, I was wrong.

get some rest, Frank.

1466

Nah, screw that.

1473
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,273
Nobody should be alone.

I'm sorry.

1483
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:18,116
I should've said that
sooner, but I didn't.

1484

And it was just because I...

1485

You were trying to help.

1486

Yes, I don't know the
first thing about helping.

To be truthful, I don't
know how you do what you do.

01:15:01,524 --> 01:15:04,608
I never thought there
was a difference between

wanting together be someone

1501
01:15:05,790 --> 01:15:08,588
and just not wanting to be alone.

1502
01:15:08,590 --> 01:15:10,198
I've been alone,

1503
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:13,213
and I don't know if it's
because I've wanted it

1504
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:18,563
or just because I just haven't
done anything about it.

1505

I hope you put it to good use.

Come on I have the telescope all set up.

It's too bright out now.

1514
01:15:41,930 --> 01:15:44,353
But later we'll see lots of stars.

1515
01:15:45,464 --> 01:15:49,438
Do you know any of them,
any of the constellations?

1516
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:50,668
I had a book when I was a kid

1517
01:15:50,670 --> 01:15:52,128
that had all the constellations in it.

1518
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:54,428
And there was a list that
I'd cross them off with

1519
01:15:54,430 --> 01:15:55,680
whenever I identify them.

1520

I told you we'll take care of it.

1523

I'll go get my camera.

01:16:02,939 --> 01:16:04,558
Okay.

1525
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,238
Thank God she has not stopped bugging me

1526
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:08,288
about this telescope since she set it up.

1527
01:16:08,290 --> 01:16:10,108
She wants this chart.

1528
01:16:10,110 --> 01:16:11,998
She wants this book thanks to you.

1529
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,038
I mean, she basically wants
to survey the entire universe.

01:16:17,603 --> 01:16:19,068

anything through a telescope
during the daytime.

1533
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:22,918
But that's not true.

- No way?
- Yeah.

Yeah.

That is Venus.

No, no.

bigger that is the moon.
