00:20:07,709 --> 00:20:08,876
Are you the father?

351
00:20:21,923 --> 00:20:27,562
[Nate gasping, spluttering]

352
00:20:27,595 --> 00:20:30,531
- [music fades]
- [monitor beeping]

353
00:20:50,785 --> 00:20:55,022
[Nate groans, breathes heavily]

354
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,835
[Dr. Clark]
What's presenting is meningitis.

355
00:21:07,869 --> 00:21:10,037
We think it probably came
from the water in the lake.

356
00:21:10,071 --> 00:21:12,707
When you dive or jump,

357
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,042
germs can blast into the sinuses
and then the bloodstream

358
00:21:15,076 --> 00:21:16,244
before inflaming the brain.

359
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:19,680
[Claire] And, uh... that's
what's causing the seizures?

360
00:21:21,682 --> 00:21:23,017
I know it's hard to watch,

361
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,919
but we're doing the best we can.

362
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:27,320
- How do you treat this?
- [Dr. Clark] Priority one

363
00:21:27,354 --> 00:21:29,422
is to reduce
the swelling around his brain

364
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:31,058
and maintain his blood pressure.

365
00:21:31,092 --> 00:21:32,693
We're treating with antibiotics

366
00:21:32,727 --> 00:21:34,427
until we know more.

367
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:35,863
And how long does that take?

368
00:21:35,897 --> 00:21:39,066
Anywhere from 28 to 48 hours.

369
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,468
He could be like this
for two more days?

370
00:21:41,903 --> 00:21:43,370
- Most likely.
- [Claire] Wait.

371
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:45,338
Why isn't anyone saying?

372
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:47,008
Excuse me?

373
00:21:48,676 --> 00:21:50,477
Why isn't anyone saying?

374
00:21:51,579 --> 00:21:53,815
Is Nate going to be okay?

375
00:21:58,886 --> 00:22:00,621
Your son is very sick.

376
00:22:02,523 --> 00:22:04,659
We're doing all we can,
but you should know,

377
00:22:05,092 --> 00:22:07,494
mortality rates
in his age and profile

378
00:22:07,528 --> 00:22:08,896
are 80 percent.

379
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:11,398
- [Dan] Oh, God.
- [Dr. Steinberg] If he survives,

380
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:14,434
there's also a significant risk
of brain impairment.

381
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:16,537
Loss of speech, loss of hearing,

382
00:22:16,737 --> 00:22:18,506
cognitive dysfunction.

383
00:22:18,773 --> 00:22:20,373
Even paralysis.

384
00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:24,045
[monitor beeping]

385
00:22:30,117 --> 00:22:32,653
- [siren wailing distantly]
- [pen tapping]

386
00:22:32,687 --> 00:22:33,721
Why?

387
00:22:38,626 --> 00:22:39,760
[sighs]

388
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:43,898
[clipboard clatters]

389
00:22:43,931 --> 00:22:45,032
I can't do this.

390
00:22:45,066 --> 00:22:46,734
[Claire] Give it to... Okay.

391
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:51,906
Look,
remember what the doctor said.

392
00:22:53,841 --> 00:22:55,176
[sighs]

393
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:58,946
We should be prepared
for all possible outcomes.

394
00:23:01,082 --> 00:23:02,516
- Right?
- I can't.

395
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,719
[Dan] What if,
in three days' time,

396
00:23:04,752 --> 00:23:06,754
he wakes up
and he's perfectly normal?

397
00:23:06,787 --> 00:23:08,022
[Claire] That's not possible.

398
00:23:08,055 --> 00:23:12,093
Nate Gibson has never been
completely normal.

399
00:23:12,693 --> 00:23:13,761
Yeah.

400
00:23:14,095 --> 00:23:15,663
He's a funny little kid.

401
00:23:17,031 --> 00:23:18,431
You remember the time

402
00:23:18,465 --> 00:23:20,400
he took that little red wagon
of his,

403
00:23:20,935 --> 00:23:23,470
loaded it up
with all my clothes,

404
00:23:23,704 --> 00:23:25,106
wheeled it around the lake,

405
00:23:25,139 --> 00:23:27,074
and tried to sell it
to all my friends?

406
00:23:30,011 --> 00:23:31,746
I mean, that kid is just...

407
00:23:35,683 --> 00:23:36,918
Dan... [sobs]

408
00:23:40,187 --> 00:23:41,522
I'm so scared.

409
00:23:45,993 --> 00:23:46,994
Me too.

410
00:23:50,197 --> 00:23:52,566
[sniffles] Part of it
is these...

411
00:23:53,634 --> 00:23:56,037
horrible thoughts I keep having.

412
00:23:57,171 --> 00:23:58,205
[Dan] I know.

413
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:03,210
Yeah. [inhales]

414
00:24:05,713 --> 00:24:06,681
[sobs]

415
00:24:10,785 --> 00:24:12,186
- [sobs]
- [Dan] It's okay.

416
00:24:14,088 --> 00:24:16,958
- [Dan kisses] It's okay.
- [sobs]

417
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:19,593
[Dan] Go ahead.

418
00:24:21,295 --> 00:24:22,797
- Let it go.
- [Claire sobs]

419
00:24:25,766 --> 00:24:27,234
- I'm right here.
- [Claire sobs]

420
00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:29,770
We'll get through this.

421
00:24:30,871 --> 00:24:32,173
[Claire sobs]

422
00:24:32,673 --> 00:24:34,508
We'll get through it.

423
00:24:37,144 --> 00:24:38,478
[Claire sobbing]

424
00:24:39,914 --> 00:24:40,915
[sobs]

425
00:24:45,019 --> 00:24:46,020
[sobs]

426
00:24:46,821 --> 00:24:49,924
- [monitor beeping]
- [clock ticking]

427
00:24:59,867 --> 00:25:02,536
So, do not leave, Nathaniel.

428
00:25:05,106 --> 00:25:06,807
[echoing]
You do not have my permission.

429
00:25:06,841 --> 00:25:08,075
You understand?

430
00:25:11,912 --> 00:25:13,147
Nate?

431
00:25:13,948 --> 00:25:15,016
Nate?

432
00:25:16,817 --> 00:25:18,052
Nate?

433
00:25:18,285 --> 00:25:21,822
[instrumental music playing]

434
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:26,293
[birds chirping]

435
00:25:58,692 --> 00:26:01,262
[thunder rumbling]

436
00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:15,709
[birds chirping]

437
00:26:33,327 --> 00:26:35,863
[thunder rumbling]

438
00:27:07,728 --> 00:27:11,799
[screaming]

439
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:14,702
[screams] Mom!

440
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:48,802
[music ends]

441
00:27:51,238 --> 00:27:52,139
[Claire] Dan!

442
00:27:55,943 --> 00:27:57,111
Dan!

443
00:27:59,013 --> 00:28:00,181
[Dan] Nate!

444
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:07,021
- [grunts]
- [breathes heavily]

445
00:28:11,425 --> 00:28:12,793
I got you, honey.

446
00:28:14,762 --> 00:28:15,729
I got you.

447
00:28:16,931 --> 00:28:19,400
- [whimpers]
- [Dan] Hold on.

448
00:28:20,968 --> 00:28:24,705
[breathes heavily]

449
00:28:25,773 --> 00:28:27,441
[Nate sobbing]

[phone rings]

00:28:57,572 --> 00:28:59,306
[receptionist]
<i>Cebus For Independence.</i>

454
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,107
[Claire] <i>Hi.</i>

455
00:29:00,341 --> 00:29:02,243
<i>I'd like to follow up
about our request</i>

456
00:29:02,276 --> 00:29:04,111
<i>for a service animal for my son.</i>

457
00:29:04,144 --> 00:29:07,014
[instrumental music playing]

[dog barking]

459
00:29:53,894 --> 00:29:56,297
- [dog barks]
- [horse neighing]

460
00:30:12,614 --> 00:30:14,014
- [man] Hi.
- [Claire] Hey.

461
00:30:24,892 --> 00:30:26,293
[Carolyn] Welcome to Cebus.

462
00:30:26,327 --> 00:30:28,862
Thank you. It's amazing.

463
00:30:28,896 --> 00:30:30,598
How are you doing, Nate?
You excited?

464
00:30:30,632 --> 00:30:33,167
- Yeah. Hell yeah, I'm excited.
- Yeah?

465
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,570
[dogs barking]

466
00:30:36,103 --> 00:30:38,472
[indistinct chatter]

467
00:30:41,676 --> 00:30:43,410
[Carolyn]
Your husband couldn't make it?

468
00:30:43,444 --> 00:30:45,346
[Claire] No, he's at home
with my mother.

469
00:30:45,379 --> 00:30:46,880
[Carolyn]
And is everything okay?

470
00:30:46,914 --> 00:30:47,881
[Claire] It will be.

471
00:30:48,215 --> 00:30:50,984
Claire, we talked about this.
I mean, you're taking on a lot,

472
00:30:51,018 --> 00:30:52,520
and if Dan's having
second thoughts...

473
00:30:52,554 --> 00:30:54,088
No. No, he's not. He's not.

474
00:30:54,121 --> 00:30:57,024
He knows that
this is what Nate wants, and...

475
00:30:58,225 --> 00:31:01,095
everything will be fine,
I promise.

476
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,202
Nate, come on.

477
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,339
Now, remember
what we talked about

478
00:31:12,373 --> 00:31:14,007
- in the home visit.
- [pig snorts]

479
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:15,409
That you're gonna go in first.

480
00:31:15,442 --> 00:31:17,144
Frank's gonna be sitting
at the table

481
00:31:17,177 --> 00:31:18,112
and we're just gonna

482
00:31:18,145 --> 00:31:20,147
give Gigi a little time
to acclimate to you.

483
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,415
- [Nate] Okay.
- [Carolyn] Okay?

484
00:31:32,426 --> 00:31:35,062
[squeaking]

485
00:31:35,663 --> 00:31:37,231
There she is.

486
00:31:39,199 --> 00:31:40,602
[chitters softly]

487
00:31:43,337 --> 00:31:44,539
Hey, Gigi.

488
00:31:44,572 --> 00:31:46,407
[squeaking]

489
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:50,177
[Carolyn] Now remember,
this is her first placement.

490
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:52,012
She has had years of training,

491
00:31:52,045 --> 00:31:55,349
but it takes a little while
for her to establish a bond.

492
00:31:58,085 --> 00:31:59,521
[Annabelle] What is that,
peanut butter?

493
00:31:59,554 --> 00:32:01,255
[Carolyn] Mm-hmm.
It helps with the training.

494
00:32:08,262 --> 00:32:09,296
[blows raspberry]

495
00:32:09,329 --> 00:32:11,098
I don't think she likes you.
[laughs]

496
00:32:11,131 --> 00:32:13,434
No, she likes me.
She... [chuckles]

497
00:32:13,467 --> 00:32:15,269
She just doesn't know it yet.

498
00:32:16,236 --> 00:32:19,973
- [squeaks]
- [laughs]

499
00:32:20,007 --> 00:32:21,074
So cute.

500
00:32:24,178 --> 00:32:25,680
Where did you get her
from again?

501
00:32:25,713 --> 00:32:28,248
A petting zoo in California.

502
00:32:28,282 --> 00:32:30,150
It was more
like a traveling circus.

503
00:32:31,185 --> 00:32:32,687
They didn't treat her so well.

504
00:32:34,021 --> 00:32:35,657
Well, that is about to change.

505
00:32:41,094 --> 00:32:42,296
Ready?

506
00:32:42,797 --> 00:32:44,231
Yeah.

507
00:32:44,699 --> 00:32:46,568
All right, let's go in slow

508
00:32:46,601 --> 00:32:48,135
so she gets used to you,

509
00:32:48,168 --> 00:32:50,037
and kind of circle around.

510
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,205
Okay?

511
00:32:51,238 --> 00:32:52,607
You guys can stay with me here,

512
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,242
- so we give them a little space.
- [squeaks]

513
00:32:57,545 --> 00:33:02,349
- [chitters]
- [wheelchair whirring]

514
00:33:04,151 --> 00:33:05,252
How you doing?

515
00:33:05,753 --> 00:33:07,054
[Gigi squeaks]

516
00:33:07,421 --> 00:33:08,590
Sorry we're late.

517
00:33:10,157 --> 00:33:11,626
It was...
it was crazy out there.

518
00:33:11,659 --> 00:33:12,760
[hoots softly]

519
00:33:15,162 --> 00:33:17,197
Yeah, I know you're supposed
to allow 15 minutes

520
00:33:17,231 --> 00:33:18,700
to account for traffic, but...

521
00:33:19,667 --> 00:33:22,336
it takes me a little while
to get ready these days.

522
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,539
[squeaks]

523
00:33:29,544 --> 00:33:31,646
- [chuckles softly]
- [Gigi squeaks]

524
00:33:32,312 --> 00:33:33,548
I haven't...

525
00:33:34,582 --> 00:33:36,618
seen him smile

526
00:33:36,651 --> 00:33:38,118
in months.

527
00:33:38,553 --> 00:33:42,590
[chittering]

528
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,036
- Hey.
- [squeaks]

529
00:33:56,838 --> 00:33:58,205

00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,351
And her sheets are disgusting.

704
00:43:04,385 --> 00:43:06,087
- Hey.
- Hi, Nana.

705
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,788
[chuckles] Oh, darling.

706
00:43:09,256 --> 00:43:10,691
[Katy sighs]

707
00:43:10,724 --> 00:43:11,926
Where's Dad?

708
00:43:12,259 --> 00:43:14,195
- [Katy opens can]
- He had to work late.

709
00:43:15,763 --> 00:43:17,098
- [Banjo barks]
- Since when?

710
00:43:17,131 --> 00:43:20,334
Since the monkey moved in.

711
00:43:20,367 --> 00:43:21,969
[barking]

712
00:43:22,269 --> 00:43:23,971
What monkey?

713
00:43:24,171 --> 00:43:26,740
[Banjo barking]

714
00:43:26,774 --> 00:43:27,775
Nate got a pet monkey.

715
00:43:28,442 --> 00:43:29,810
Katy, I was gonna tell you

716
00:43:29,844 --> 00:43:31,412
that we have decided
that what we...

717
00:43:31,445 --> 00:43:32,780
No. Mom, you said

718
00:43:32,813 --> 00:43:34,215
that you were
just thinking about it.

719
00:43:34,248 --> 00:43:35,916
- [Banjo barking]
- She's not a pet,

720
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:37,151
- she's a service animal.
- Right.

721
00:43:37,184 --> 00:43:38,919
You can't keep
a freaking monkey in the house.

722
00:43:39,453 --> 00:43:41,889
Says who?
You don't live here anymore.

723
00:43:41,922 --> 00:43:43,057
Where is it?

724
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,661
Katy!

725
00:43:48,162 --> 00:43:49,964
Katy, there is a protocol
to all this

726
00:43:49,997 --> 00:43:52,032
and you are not supposed
to just go up there.

727
00:43:52,066 --> 00:43:53,400
You're gonna freak her out.

728
00:43:53,434 --> 00:43:55,302
Katy, are you listening?

729
00:43:55,336 --> 00:43:57,171
- Oh, my God.
- [Claire] Never mind.

730
00:43:59,006 --> 00:44:00,708
You keep her in a cage?

731
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:04,278
It's not a cage,

732
00:44:04,478 --> 00:44:05,946
It's her house. She likes it.

733
00:44:10,918 --> 00:44:11,819
Hi.

734
00:44:14,922 --> 00:44:18,292
- Hi.
- [hoots]

735
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:26,333
[Katy] Are you okay?
No, you're not.

736
00:44:26,367 --> 00:44:28,302
[Nate] Uh, I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

737
00:44:28,335 --> 00:44:30,104
- [chitters, screeches]
- [groans]

738
00:44:30,137 --> 00:44:31,005
[Annabelle chuckles, gasps]

739
00:44:31,238 --> 00:44:33,307
Look! See, you don't disturb her
when she's eating.

740
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,109
Basic Monkey 101. [chuckles]

741
00:44:35,142 --> 00:44:39,346
- [groans] It went in my mouth.
- Oh, my God! [laughs]

742
00:44:39,648 --> 00:44:41,315
I told you not to do that.

743
00:44:41,916 --> 00:44:44,685
I'll get it. It's okay.
Come here.

744
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,955
What is wrong with you people?
Monkeys are primates.

745
00:44:47,988 --> 00:44:49,390
They're supposed
to be in the wild,

746
00:44:49,423 --> 00:44:50,324
not kept in cages.

747
00:44:50,625 --> 00:44:53,227
[Claire] Gigi is here for Nate.
She is not here for you.

748
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:55,896
Nate doesn't need
his own monkey slave.

749
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:57,198
Travis, can you tell them?

750
00:44:57,231 --> 00:44:59,166
- You know that I'm right.
- I'm Switzerland here.

751
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,035
- [Annabelle laughs]
- Smart lawyer. Very smart.

752
00:45:01,068 --> 00:45:02,169
Okay. Mom, this is cruel.

753
00:45:02,203 --> 00:45:04,205
- [Annabelle] Come on.
- [Katy] It's inhumane, crazy...

754
00:45:04,238 --> 00:45:06,407
- Get off of your soapbox.
- I'm not gonna be a part of it.

755
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,275
Literally no one
is asking you to!

756
00:45:08,309 --> 00:45:09,276
[Mama Blanche]
Don't open the gate, Travis!

757
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:10,311
- [Travis] Banjo, stop!
- [Mama Blanche screams]

758
00:45:10,344 --> 00:45:12,246
[Claire] Oh, no, no!
Get him, get him, get him!

759
00:45:12,279 --> 00:45:14,081
- [dramatic music playing]
- [Nate] Hey, grab him!

760
00:45:14,114 --> 00:45:15,749
- [Annabelle] Banjo!
- Banjo!

761
00:45:15,783 --> 00:45:17,451
- Somebody get him! Banjo!
- [barking]

762
00:45:17,484 --> 00:45:21,288
- [screeches]
- Gigi! Gigi!

763
00:45:21,322 --> 00:45:23,023
[Claire] Annabelle,
shut the door!

764
00:45:23,057 --> 00:45:25,259
- [barks]
- [screeches]

765
00:45:25,292 --> 00:45:26,961
[Claire] Banjo! Banjo, no!

766
00:45:26,994 --> 00:45:28,395
[shrieks]

767
00:45:28,429 --> 00:45:29,163
[Claire] Banjo!

768
00:45:29,396 --> 00:45:31,098
- [growls]
- [Annabelle] Banjo, get down!

769
00:45:32,933 --> 00:45:34,268
[grunts]

770
00:45:35,469 --> 00:45:38,772
- [Annabelle] Gigi!
- [screeches]

771
00:45:38,806 --> 00:45:40,007
[Claire] Stay! Stay!

772
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,442
[Katy] He's gonna
eat the monkey!

773
00:45:43,344 --> 00:45:45,746
[Annabelle] No, no, no, no, no,
Gigi! Gigi!

774
00:45:47,881 --> 00:45:48,949
Gigi, Come here.

775
00:45:50,351 --> 00:45:53,287
- [screeches]
- [growls]

776
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,523
[all clamoring]

777
00:45:55,557 --> 00:45:58,259
[Annabelle] Banjo, come back!
Banjo!

778
00:45:59,126 --> 00:46:01,462
[screeches]

779
00:46:02,062 --> 00:46:04,064
- [growls]
- [screeches]

780
00:46:14,341 --> 00:46:16,477
- Gigi! Get the dog!
- [Travis] I got him.

781
00:46:17,612 --> 00:46:19,046
Hey, Gigi, it's okay.

782
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:20,447
[music concludes]

783
00:46:20,481 --> 00:46:22,082
- [Nate] Gigi!
- [Travis] It's okay, boy.

784
00:46:22,116 --> 00:46:24,084
Travis, man, how could you
let Banjo out the gate?

785
00:46:24,118 --> 00:46:25,886
It's not his fault
that our dog's psycho!

786
00:46:25,919 --> 00:46:27,388
Like the rest of this family!

787
00:46:27,421 --> 00:46:29,857
- [overlapping clamor]
- That is rich coming from you!

788
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:31,925
- It's not his fault?
- I didn't mean to, I...

789
00:46:31,959 --> 00:46:34,895
[Nate] I specifically said don't
go in there, you're gonna...

790
00:46:43,237 --> 00:46:44,471
What the hell's going on here?

791
00:46:44,706 --> 00:46:50,844
[overlapping clamor]

792
00:46:50,878 --> 00:46:52,313
One person at a time.

793
00:46:52,346 --> 00:46:55,349
- [overlapping clamor]
- [Banjo growls]

794
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:57,017
One answer.

795
00:46:57,051 --> 00:47:01,255
- One person at a time.
- [squeaks]

796
00:47:01,455 --> 00:47:02,590
[groans]

797
00:47:15,503 --> 00:47:17,304
This is getting
a little ridiculous, Claire.

798
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:20,941
We got a junior in high school,
we got a son in a wheelchair,

799
00:47:20,974 --> 00:47:22,409
we got your eighty-year-old
mother here,

800
00:47:22,677 --> 00:47:25,012
and you wanna bring a monkey
into the mix?

801
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:28,650
And train it, and feed it,
and clean up

802
00:47:28,683 --> 00:47:31,051
after it tears the house apart?

803
00:47:31,085 --> 00:47:32,886
I thought
you were on board with this.

804
00:47:33,555 --> 00:47:36,023
I was. I am.

805
00:47:36,691 --> 00:47:38,292
[Claire] Doesn't seem like it.

806
00:47:38,325 --> 00:47:40,461
[Dan] I just wanna be able
to come home and relax

807
00:47:40,494 --> 00:47:42,530
at the end of a long week,
that's all.

808
00:47:43,397 --> 00:47:46,634
Great. Fine. Go relax.

809
00:47:47,067 --> 00:47:49,370
Not like you ever help me out
with anything anyway.

810
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:55,510
Okay. [sighs]

811
00:47:59,246 --> 00:48:00,948
- What's going on?
- Come on.

812
00:48:01,248 --> 00:48:03,183
When is the last time that you

813
00:48:03,217 --> 00:48:05,486
got up at three in the morning
to turn Nate?

814
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,288
Claire, I work. How do you think
we pay for our health insurance?

815
00:48:08,322 --> 00:48:12,459
Yeah. Why? You can't get up,
I don't know, maybe once a week

816
00:48:12,493 --> 00:48:14,194
to help me out?

817
00:48:14,228 --> 00:48:15,563
[Dan] I need my sleep, Claire.

818
00:48:15,597 --> 00:48:17,264
[Claire] You need your sleep?
[scoffs]

819
00:48:17,297 --> 00:48:19,400
[Dan] If you had a job,
you'd understand it.

820
00:48:19,433 --> 00:48:21,368
[Claire] I do have a job!
It just doesn't pay!

821
00:48:21,402 --> 00:48:22,936
[Dan] You think
you're the only one

822
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:24,438
who makes sacrifices
around here?

823
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:27,174
What else do you want, Dan, huh?

824
00:48:27,609 --> 00:48:29,410
You want your perfect life back.

825
00:48:29,644 --> 00:48:31,445
You want your perfect son back.

826
00:48:31,478 --> 00:48:33,280
And your
country club membership,

827
00:48:33,313 --> 00:48:35,115
and your house on the lake.

828
00:48:35,149 --> 00:48:37,151
You were the one
that sold Happy Days.

829
00:48:37,184 --> 00:48:38,553
Because I had to.

830
00:48:38,586 --> 00:48:40,454
How else were we gonna afford
Nate's bedroom?

831
00:48:40,487 --> 00:48:43,056
You know what? We had plenty
of money when you were working.

832
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:43,924
[Claire] Yeah, we did.

833
00:48:44,258 --> 00:48:46,360
[Dan] Well then, why don't you
go back to the studio?

834
00:48:46,393 --> 00:48:48,563
- Do some cleaning...
- I don't have any time!

835
00:48:48,962 --> 00:48:51,498
I take care of Nate
day and night.

836
00:48:51,866 --> 00:48:53,635
[Dan] Come on.

837
00:48:53,668 --> 00:48:56,370
Claire,
you can't fix everything!

838
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:58,706
I mean, if you think
that this monkey's

839
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,542
gonna be some magic bullet
that's gonna

840
00:49:00,575 --> 00:49:03,110
get Nate out of that wheelchair
and walk again,

841
00:49:03,143 --> 00:49:04,344
you are wrong!

842
00:49:04,378 --> 00:49:06,079
[Gigi chitters]

843
00:49:06,113 --> 00:49:07,114
You wanna get rid of Gigi?

844
00:49:07,381 --> 00:49:09,617
- No, I didn't say that. Cla...
- No, no, it's okay. Come on.

845
00:49:09,651 --> 00:49:12,386
- Now don't get this way with me.
- But you tell him. You be the..

846
00:49:12,419 --> 00:49:13,487
- Claire...
- Go on up there!

847
00:49:13,888 --> 00:49:18,560
And you tell Nate,
"I'm here to take away

848
00:49:18,593 --> 00:49:21,295
the one good thing
that's happened to you

849
00:49:21,328 --> 00:49:23,230
in the last four years"!

850
00:49:24,732 --> 00:49:26,066
Claire.

851
00:49:48,155 --> 00:49:49,423
Dad's right.

852
00:49:49,657 --> 00:49:51,058
What?

853
00:49:54,495 --> 00:49:56,463
We should take Gigi back.
It's too much.

854
00:49:57,364 --> 00:50:01,703
No, it's not. Your... your dad
and I were just venting, honey.

855
00:50:03,505 --> 00:50:06,240
Everything's gonna be all right.

856
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,209
You sold Happy Days
because of me.

857
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:13,313
You haven't...

858
00:50:13,948 --> 00:50:16,751
painted or sculpted in years
'cause of me.

859
00:50:22,222 --> 00:50:23,825
I don't want
to be more of a burden

860
00:50:23,858 --> 00:50:25,092
than I already am.

861
00:50:28,228 --> 00:50:31,431
[Claire] Nate,
you are not a burden, okay?

862
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:32,834
I am your mother.

863
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:37,471
- There will never be a time...
- Oh, Mom, stop. Mom! Get off me!

864
00:50:47,114 --> 00:50:48,348
I just wanna sleep.

865
00:50:52,452 --> 00:50:54,589
It's the only time
I don't have to think about it.

866
00:51:02,797 --> 00:51:04,264
[door closing]

867
00:51:11,138 --> 00:51:13,173
Uh, can you please let her know

868
00:51:13,206 --> 00:51:15,409
that I will be at this number
all day.

869
00:51:16,911 --> 00:51:18,412
Okay. Thank you.

870
00:51:21,481 --> 00:51:22,617
Was that Cebus?

871
00:51:27,154 --> 00:51:28,221
Mm-hmm.

872
00:51:30,223 --> 00:51:30,992
[soft music playing]

01:00:28,262 --> 01:00:29,830
Leprechauns. I understand.

1048
01:00:29,864 --> 01:00:32,733
[chittering]

1049
01:00:32,766 --> 01:00:34,902
Yeah? [chuckles]

1050
01:00:35,836 --> 01:00:37,838
All right. Here we go.

1051
01:00:37,872 --> 01:00:39,640
Come on, don't fail me now,
hands.

1052
01:00:40,141 --> 01:00:42,042
Come on. There you go.

1053
01:00:43,911 --> 01:00:45,079
[Lori] Hey, do I...

1054
01:00:45,514 --> 01:00:46,981
Do I know you?

1055
01:00:47,549 --> 01:00:49,049
That a trick question?

1056
01:00:50,751 --> 01:00:52,887
Oh. Oh, my God, you're...

1057
01:00:53,354 --> 01:00:57,191
It... it's me. Lori. We went
swimming on 4th of July, and...

1058
01:00:57,758 --> 01:00:59,760
[Nate] Yes, right. Oh, my...

1059
01:00:59,793 --> 01:01:02,663
- [chitters]
- [chuckles] Sorry, um...

1060
01:01:03,397 --> 01:01:05,099
Oh my God, you look different.

1061
01:01:05,366 --> 01:01:07,334
Me? God, what the hell
happened to you?

1062
01:01:07,636 --> 01:01:11,038
- [chuckles]
- Oh, my God, I am so sorry.

1063
01:01:11,071 --> 01:01:12,973
- [Nate] It's okay.
- No, it's not. It's not okay.

1064
01:01:13,007 --> 01:01:15,442
That's like the worst thing I've
ever said in my entire life.

1065
01:01:15,476 --> 01:01:17,845
I am so sorry. I really didn't...
I didn't mean to...

1066
01:01:17,878 --> 01:01:19,813
Let me get it out the way
for you, okay?

1067
01:01:19,847 --> 01:01:20,915
Yes, I'm paralyzed.

1068
01:01:20,948 --> 01:01:22,149
Yes, it hurts.

1069
01:01:22,551 --> 01:01:24,251
No, I can't go to the bathroom.

1070
01:01:24,285 --> 01:01:25,853
Yes, I can feed myself.

1071
01:01:25,886 --> 01:01:27,188
And no, I don't need you

1072
01:01:27,221 --> 01:01:28,455
to get me anything
off the shelf.

1073
01:01:32,426 --> 01:01:36,730
[chuckles] So, the, uh,
the... the monkey. [chuckles]

1074
01:01:38,766 --> 01:01:39,934
What monkey?

1075
01:01:40,535 --> 01:01:42,903
- No. [chuckles] Yeah.
- [chuckles]

1076
01:01:42,937 --> 01:01:43,971
This is Gigi.

1077
01:01:44,004 --> 01:01:45,472
- My service animal.
- [chitters]

1078
01:01:46,774 --> 01:01:47,609
Can I pet him?

1079
01:01:47,908 --> 01:01:50,844
Her. And, uh, no, sorry,
I'm not supposed to let you.

1080
01:01:50,878 --> 01:01:53,013
Why, does she...
Does she bite or something?

1081
01:01:53,047 --> 01:01:54,882
No, no, she's...
She's super friendly.

1082
01:01:54,915 --> 01:01:56,951
But, uh, it's just kinda
what I have to do.

1083
01:01:59,554 --> 01:02:01,055
Although, uh...

1084
01:02:01,488 --> 01:02:02,957
she likes fruit.

1085
01:02:03,357 --> 01:02:04,892
Like a lot.

1086
01:02:04,925 --> 01:02:07,962
So, uh, you got
any blueberries lying around?

1087
01:02:08,597 --> 01:02:12,032
Uh, yeah. Yeah, for sure.
Um, one second.

1088
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:19,206
You hungry? Please be hungry.
You better eat right now.

1089
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:20,941
[squeaks]

1090
01:02:21,842 --> 01:02:24,211
- [Nate] Oh, look at this.
- [chuckles]

1091
01:02:24,245 --> 01:02:26,413
Okay, one at a time,
in the palm of your hand.

1092
01:02:26,747 --> 01:02:29,250
[Lori] Want it? Maybe not.

1093
01:02:29,283 --> 01:02:32,152
- [Nate] Go on.
- Okay. [chuckles]

1094
01:02:32,186 --> 01:02:34,054
Oh, you like that?

1095
01:02:34,088 --> 01:02:36,323
- Aren't you lucky.
- [chuckles] She is so cute.

1096
01:02:37,124 --> 01:02:38,526
So, this is kinda crazy.

1097
01:02:39,193 --> 01:02:41,395
You... you live in Nashville now?

1098
01:02:41,428 --> 01:02:44,865
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I'm a...
I'm a senior at Belmont.

1099
01:02:44,898 --> 01:02:47,167
Theater program.
People say I am very dramatic.

1100
01:02:48,035 --> 01:02:49,370
[squeaks]

1101
01:02:50,437 --> 01:02:51,839
I'm sorry, can I get a picture?

1102
01:02:51,872 --> 01:02:53,073
[chuckles]

1103
01:02:53,474 --> 01:02:56,511
- [Nate] Hey, smile.
- Smile, little monkey.

1104
01:02:56,544 --> 01:02:59,413
- [camera shutter clicks]
- [chuckles] Ah, that's awesome.

1105
01:02:59,446 --> 01:03:01,015
'Cause I totally
have to post this,

1106
01:03:01,048 --> 01:03:02,983
so what's your, uh,
what's your handle?

1107
01:03:03,017 --> 01:03:05,019
You know, now I have to say it
out loud,

1108
01:03:05,052 --> 01:03:06,554
it's kind of embarrassing,
but, uh..

1109
01:03:06,588 --> 01:03:07,921
"Its the monkey guy."

1110
01:03:07,955 --> 01:03:09,857
- [chuckles]
- [Nate chuckles] Yeah.

1111
01:03:09,890 --> 01:03:11,158
No, it's, it's cute.

1112
01:03:11,191 --> 01:03:12,459
- [chuckles]
- [Lori] All right.

1113
01:03:12,493 --> 01:03:14,361
I love it. All right. Um...

1114
01:03:16,631 --> 01:03:18,098
Uh, I...

1115
01:03:18,633 --> 01:03:21,402
I have to get back to work,
but, um...

1116
01:03:22,002 --> 01:03:24,171
it was really nice
to see you, Nate.

1117
01:03:24,204 --> 01:03:25,439
Yeah, you, too.

1118
01:03:26,073 --> 01:03:28,576
We should, um,
we should hang out sometime.

1119
01:03:29,943 --> 01:03:31,445
Yeah, that... that could be cool.

1120
01:03:32,179 --> 01:03:34,848
- Um... All right. Bye.
- All right. [chuckles]

1121
01:03:35,049 --> 01:03:36,116
Bye.

1122
01:03:39,353 --> 01:03:42,990
Nice job, Gigi. [chuckles]

1123
01:03:50,598 --> 01:03:52,232
You know that girl?

1124
01:03:52,433 --> 01:03:54,201
Yeah, yeah. Her name's Lori.

1125
01:03:58,506 --> 01:04:01,108
Young man? Young man.

1126
01:04:01,141 --> 01:04:02,276
Hi.

1127
01:04:02,476 --> 01:04:04,845
Hi. Is that your monkey?

1128
01:04:05,045 --> 01:04:06,648
Yeah. This is Gigi.

1129
01:04:06,681 --> 01:04:09,083
- You wanna get a picture?
- He can't be in here.

1130
01:04:09,517 --> 01:04:11,218
- Excuse me?
- It's against the law.

1131
01:04:11,619 --> 01:04:13,354
[Claire] Oh, no, actually,
it's not.

1132
01:04:13,387 --> 01:04:15,889
This is a service animal
for my son.

1133
01:04:16,156 --> 01:04:17,424
Service animals are only allowed

1134
01:04:17,458 --> 01:04:19,059
in places
of public accommodation.

1135
01:04:19,093 --> 01:04:21,061
That doesn't
include grocery stores.

1136
01:04:21,095 --> 01:04:23,230
Thank you very much.
But we come here all the time.

1137
01:04:23,263 --> 01:04:24,632
It's not sanitary.

1138
01:04:24,932 --> 01:04:27,401
Monkeys carry diseases
and it's a public health risk.

1139
01:04:27,434 --> 01:04:29,036
You could
get everybody in here sick.

1140
01:04:29,069 --> 01:04:30,304
[Claire] Excuse me, lady...

1141
01:04:30,337 --> 01:04:32,005
Mom, forget about it.

1142
01:04:32,607 --> 01:04:36,009
- Okay, we were just leaving.
- No, I won't forget about it.

1143
01:04:36,343 --> 01:04:39,179
- We have every right to be here.
- Not with that monkey.

1144
01:04:40,481 --> 01:04:41,982
Should I get the manager?

1145
01:04:44,519 --> 01:04:46,887
[birds chirping]

1146
01:04:47,421 --> 01:04:50,257
[quiet music playing]

1147
01:05:08,475 --> 01:05:10,244
[doorbell rings]

1148
01:05:11,746 --> 01:05:13,681
[Sgt. Ellis]
Got this from the manager.

1149
01:05:13,715 --> 01:05:16,316
Now, he says he didn't even know
y'all were there.

1150
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:18,085
Then what
is he complaining about?

1151
01:05:18,118 --> 01:05:19,521
- Yeah.
- [Sgt. Ellis] Well, he's not.

1152
01:05:20,387 --> 01:05:21,623
Call we got

1153
01:05:21,856 --> 01:05:24,958
came from this lady here.

1154
01:05:27,327 --> 01:05:30,063
Y'all ever heard of Americans
For Animal Protection?

1155
01:05:30,097 --> 01:05:32,099
- Mm-mm.
- Um, vaguely.

1156
01:05:32,132 --> 01:05:34,702
That there is Chloe Gaines,
Tennessee chapter president.

1157
01:05:37,037 --> 01:05:38,673
- Wait, you know her?
- [Sgt. Ellis] Oh, yeah.

1158
01:05:38,706 --> 01:05:40,542
Everyone in Animal Control does.

1159
01:05:40,909 --> 01:05:43,076
Chloe's the reason
you can't keep live chickens

1160
01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:44,679
in Davidson County anymore.

1161
01:05:44,712 --> 01:05:47,114
Or snakes, or exotic birds.

1162
01:05:47,481 --> 01:05:49,249
There's a whole long list. Now...

1163
01:05:49,283 --> 01:05:51,485
[overlapping clamor]

1164
01:05:51,519 --> 01:05:53,987
I can't get anything
off the shelves without her.

1165
01:05:54,021 --> 01:05:55,657
Guys. Officer, I'll take it.
This is on me.

1166
01:05:55,924 --> 01:05:57,424
Um, Officer,

1167
01:05:57,458 --> 01:05:59,293
Gigi is a service animal,

1168
01:05:59,326 --> 01:06:01,563
so we all thought that we could
just bring her anywhere.

1169
01:06:01,596 --> 01:06:03,497
Well, you can, except...

1170
01:06:03,964 --> 01:06:06,200
for grocery stores,
or restaurants.

1171
01:06:06,233 --> 01:06:08,469
Basically,
anything around food handling.

1172
01:06:08,503 --> 01:06:10,971
Okay, got it. Now we know.
Never happen again.

1173
01:06:11,405 --> 01:06:12,473
Mm. Yeah.

1174
01:06:16,343 --> 01:06:18,345
So... [sighs]

1175
01:06:18,746 --> 01:06:20,247
I've seen the animal.

1176
01:06:21,215 --> 01:06:22,382
ID'd the owner.

1177
01:06:22,817 --> 01:06:24,652
Investigated the environment.

1178
01:06:25,219 --> 01:06:28,523
Nothing inhumane or unsanitary
going on around here, right?

1179
01:06:28,857 --> 01:06:31,358
Come back for dinner.
[chuckles softly]

1180
01:06:31,391 --> 01:06:33,060
[Claire] <i>We've been going</i>
<i>to that store</i>

1181
01:06:33,093 --> 01:06:34,228
<i>for over a year now</i>

1182
01:06:34,261 --> 01:06:36,029
<i>and no one's ever said a thing.</i>

1183
01:06:36,063 --> 01:06:37,599
[Carolyn] Claire, I get it

1184
01:06:37,832 --> 01:06:40,367
and I know it's frustrating,
but trust me,

1185
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,169
it's not worth
picking a fight over.

1186
01:06:42,202 --> 01:06:44,572
Just please, next time,
leave Gigi at home.

1187
01:06:44,606 --> 01:06:46,273
She's a busybody.

1188
01:06:46,306 --> 01:06:49,343
And I wanted to punch her
right in her botoxed face.

1189
01:06:49,376 --> 01:06:51,613
[Carolyn] <i>Remind me</i>
<i>never to get on your bad side.</i>

1190
01:06:51,646 --> 01:06:52,647
[chuckles]

1191
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:54,716
[Claire] ...has enough food,
and then Nate, uh,

1192
01:06:54,749 --> 01:06:55,717
his exercise balls
are right over here, okay?

1193
01:06:55,984 --> 01:06:58,352
- Yeah, watch out, on your left.
- You got them right here.

1194
01:06:58,385 --> 01:06:59,453
And then here's his schedule.

1195
01:06:59,486 --> 01:07:01,823
Annabelle, she has a sleepover
right after school.

1196
01:07:01,856 --> 01:07:04,424
Then Nogo's coming in at 5:30,
just a little bit early.

1197
01:07:04,458 --> 01:07:06,828
Katy promised she'd be here
no later than ten o'clock.

1198
01:07:06,861 --> 01:07:08,696
Here are all of Nate's meds.

1199
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:10,798
Oh, don't forget he has to
recline at two o'clock,

1200
01:07:10,832 --> 01:07:12,199
then again at four o'clock.

1201
01:07:12,232 --> 01:07:14,134
And here are
the emergency medical numbers

1202
01:07:14,167 --> 01:07:16,136
- just in case you need them.
- Claire, I get it.

1203
01:07:16,169 --> 01:07:18,238
- I've raised two kids.
- But we weren't special needs.

1204
01:07:18,272 --> 01:07:19,473
Hmm. Debatable.

1205
01:07:19,507 --> 01:07:21,709
Mama. Okay, here are the numbers

1206
01:07:21,743 --> 01:07:23,578
of where we're gonna be,
all right?

1207
01:07:23,611 --> 01:07:24,712
My cell phone number...

1208
01:07:24,746 --> 01:07:26,814
Mom, nothing is gonna happen.
Okay?

1209
01:07:27,114 --> 01:07:28,716
You got Dan's cell phone number,
okay?

1210
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:30,652
You just call us
and we will come right back.

1211
01:07:30,685 --> 01:07:32,620
- My mom's gone crazy.
- Any questions?

1212
01:07:33,588 --> 01:07:35,222
When are you gonna leave?

1213
01:07:35,255 --> 01:07:37,525
This is the longest goodbye

01:16:24,952 --> 01:16:26,120
Look at you.

1385
01:16:26,420 --> 01:16:29,290
You're a complete mess!
What the hell were you thinking?

1386
01:16:32,359 --> 01:16:34,128
I just wanted to go to a party.

1387
01:16:40,301 --> 01:16:44,705
[rap song playing over radio]

1388
01:16:44,738 --> 01:16:45,906
[Nate] Oh.

1389
01:16:46,674 --> 01:16:50,811
Oh, my God, this is officially
the best burger I've ever had.

1390
01:16:50,845 --> 01:16:51,946
Ever.

1391
01:16:52,413 --> 01:16:55,649
I think
that's the booze talking, maybe.

1392
01:16:56,217 --> 01:16:59,053
Hopefully all that grease
will soak it up.

1393
01:17:00,855 --> 01:17:02,223
So, um...

1394
01:17:02,557 --> 01:17:05,292
I actually got a job offer
yesterday.

1395
01:17:08,796 --> 01:17:10,297
The problem is, it's in Atlanta.

1396
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:14,235
What is the problem with that?

1397
01:17:14,768 --> 01:17:16,403
Because I'd have to move.

1398
01:17:19,273 --> 01:17:20,641
And you don't want to?

1399
01:17:23,043 --> 01:17:24,278
Nate, I feel...

1400
01:17:24,645 --> 01:17:27,181
like I have a responsibility

1401
01:17:27,214 --> 01:17:28,983
to take care of you,

1402
01:17:29,016 --> 01:17:30,284
and I'm worried...

1403
01:17:31,085 --> 01:17:32,453
if I leave,

1404
01:17:32,486 --> 01:17:35,322
- that you won't be okay.
- [Nate sighs]

1405
01:17:38,792 --> 01:17:39,894
Okay.

1406
01:17:40,794 --> 01:17:43,731
First of all, that's insane.

1407
01:17:44,098 --> 01:17:45,032
Second of all,

1408
01:17:45,065 --> 01:17:47,067
since when have you
ever taken care of me?

1409
01:17:47,101 --> 01:17:49,770
- [Katy] Yeah, that's my point.
- Ever. [laughs]

1410
01:17:49,803 --> 01:17:51,872
[Katy] I was already in college
when you got hurt.

1411
01:17:51,906 --> 01:17:54,175
And I went
through the whole thing

1412
01:17:54,208 --> 01:17:55,676
being so selfish,

1413
01:17:56,243 --> 01:17:58,846
and self-centered,
and I fully admit that.

1414
01:18:00,014 --> 01:18:01,348
But I'm older now.

1415
01:18:01,882 --> 01:18:04,919
- I... I feel like it's my turn.
- [Nate] Turn?

1416
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:08,055
What turn? There is no turn.

1417
01:18:08,088 --> 01:18:09,390
- I'm being serious.
- So am I.

1418
01:18:09,423 --> 01:18:11,425
You can't change your life
because of me.

1419
01:18:15,296 --> 01:18:16,730
You don't think I...

1420
01:18:17,498 --> 01:18:19,433
already feel like a burden
all of the time?

1421
01:18:19,466 --> 01:18:22,236
It's not a burden. I just...
I wanna be here if you need me.

1422
01:18:22,269 --> 01:18:23,837
Why is it so wrong?

1423
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:27,274
Because.

1424
01:18:29,777 --> 01:18:31,412
You already gave me
what I needed.

1425
01:18:34,516 --> 01:18:36,450
Come on. I was...
It was in the hospital,

1426
01:18:36,483 --> 01:18:38,052
I was lying in the bed.

1427
01:18:39,787 --> 01:18:41,789
It was cold,
there were all these nurses.

1428
01:18:42,289 --> 01:18:44,858
<i>I know I looked like
I was out of it, but I wasn't.</i>

1429
01:18:44,892 --> 01:18:45,926
<i>I was awake.</i>

1430
01:18:48,495 --> 01:18:51,065
And it hurt, a lot,
and I couldn't tell anyone.

1431
01:18:52,933 --> 01:18:54,335
And then you came in.

1432
01:18:56,303 --> 01:18:57,505
And you said...

1433
01:19:01,242 --> 01:19:04,011
"Don't leave, Nathaniel.
You don't have my permission."

1434
01:19:08,382 --> 01:19:09,450
I heard you.

1435
01:19:12,486 --> 01:19:14,021
I fought.

1436
01:19:16,290 --> 01:19:17,424
I didn't leave.

1437
01:19:20,861 --> 01:19:24,031
[train horn blaring]

1438
01:19:27,001 --> 01:19:29,436
You already saved me once.
You don't have to do it again.

1439
01:19:36,910 --> 01:19:39,213
[birds chirping]

1440
01:19:42,016 --> 01:19:44,151
- [Nate] This is so bad.
- [Katy] It's everywhere.

1441
01:19:44,184 --> 01:19:45,853
I asked them
not to post that online.

1442
01:19:45,886 --> 01:19:47,988
- Didn't you see this happening?
- [Nate] No.

1443
01:19:48,022 --> 01:19:49,857
[Katy] So, I think they found
your name.

1444
01:19:49,890 --> 01:19:51,859
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

1445
01:19:53,561 --> 01:19:55,195
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

1446
01:19:55,229 --> 01:19:56,363
Nate!

1447
01:19:56,598 --> 01:19:57,532
What?

1448
01:19:57,798 --> 01:19:59,233
We have to show her.

1449
01:19:59,266 --> 01:20:00,467
Show me what?

1450
01:20:02,436 --> 01:20:04,305
[wheelchair whirring]

1451
01:20:06,373 --> 01:20:07,841
Oh, my word.

1452
01:20:09,443 --> 01:20:10,578
When was this?

1453
01:20:12,112 --> 01:20:13,280
Last night.

1454
01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:17,451
Last night?

1455
01:20:18,152 --> 01:20:19,453
Oh, my God.

- Mom, it's not his fault.
- Oh, my...

1460
01:20:32,734 --> 01:20:35,369
My friends were having a party
and I wanted Nate to go.

1461
01:20:35,402 --> 01:20:36,904
Why?

1462
01:20:36,937 --> 01:20:38,339
Because he never
leaves the house!

1463
01:20:38,372 --> 01:20:39,907
He leaves the house
all the time!

1464
01:20:40,107 --> 01:20:41,942
Yeah, not for anything fun!

Don't go

And you guys took Gigi?

1474
01:20:58,158 --> 01:21:00,327
You took Gigi to a party.

1475

of Gigi drinking!

- Asleep.
- Where was Nogo?

I gave her the night off!

your freaking phones

1497

do you think it is...

Come on.

Come on.

1555
01:24:10,183 --> 01:24:12,185
You people are insane!

1556
01:24:12,620 --> 01:24:14,121
What's going on?

1557
01:24:14,154 --> 01:24:16,691
Well, Nate went to a party
last night, took Gigi.

1558
01:24:16,724 --> 01:24:18,693
- What?
- Yes. And the video went viral.

1559
01:24:18,726 --> 01:24:20,460
- [Nogo] Oh, my God.
- Now we've got AFAP on our hands

1560
01:24:20,494 --> 01:24:23,163
and we've got all these...
Mama, what are you doing?

1561
01:24:23,196 --> 01:24:24,732
[Mama Blanche]
Protecting your property.

1562
01:24:24,766 --> 01:24:26,133
You're disgusting!

1563
01:24:26,166 --> 01:24:28,135
Sidewalk only. Not on our lawn.

1564
01:24:28,168 --> 01:24:29,303
- Mom.
- You hear me?

1565
01:24:29,336 --> 01:24:30,838
You wanna take my picture?
Cheese.

1566
01:24:30,872 --> 01:24:32,306
You wanna take my picture?
Cheese.

1567
01:24:32,607 --> 01:24:36,678
[quiet music playing]

1568
01:24:40,548 --> 01:24:43,116
- [Carolyn] I can't believe this.
- [Claire] I know.

1569
01:24:44,151 --> 01:24:46,119
I know. It's pretty bad.

1570
01:24:46,821 --> 01:24:49,524
So, you said
there was gonna be a hearing?

1571
01:24:49,557 --> 01:24:50,825
- Yeah.
- When?

1572
01:24:50,858 --> 01:24:52,092
Two days.

1573
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:57,264
These people are very powerful,
and they've been lobbying

1574
01:24:57,297 --> 01:24:59,166
to change
the service animal laws

1575
01:24:59,199 --> 01:25:00,233
for years

1576
01:25:00,635 --> 01:25:03,203
and Tennessee
was always on their list.

1577
01:25:03,236 --> 01:25:03,938
Change them how?

1578
01:25:04,171 --> 01:25:06,306
[Carolyn]
By making capuchins illegal.

1579
01:25:06,340 --> 01:25:09,276
They've already done it
in Kansas and Florida.

1580
01:25:09,309 --> 01:25:12,112
And now, with all this...

1581
01:25:12,814 --> 01:25:15,182
What, you're saying they're
doing this because of me?

1582
01:25:15,215 --> 01:25:16,851
They see an opportunity, Nate.

1583
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:19,453
All we did
was take her to a stupid party.

1584
01:25:19,486 --> 01:25:21,188
It's not like she hurt anybody.

1585
01:25:21,221 --> 01:25:24,124
I know, but it's not about that.

1586
01:25:24,759 --> 01:25:26,694
Look, once Animal Control
gets involved,

1587
01:25:26,728 --> 01:25:27,862
it changes things.

1588
01:25:27,895 --> 01:25:29,396
There's a lot of people

1589
01:25:29,429 --> 01:25:30,832
that don't agree
with what we do.

1590
01:25:32,934 --> 01:25:34,736
Okay, so what happens
if they change the law?

1591
01:25:34,769 --> 01:25:36,604
You guys, what,
you're gonna take Gigi away

1592
01:25:36,638 --> 01:25:38,405
and I'm never gonna
see her again?

1593
01:25:42,510 --> 01:25:45,479
[wheelchair whirring]

1594
01:25:45,513 --> 01:25:47,414
[dramatic music playing]

1595
01:25:54,989 --> 01:25:57,625
[reporter 1] And after several
complaints to Animal Control

1596
01:25:57,659 --> 01:26:00,327
involving a local man
and his monkey helper,

1597
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:03,263
the legislature is scheduled
to take up the issue tomorrow.

1598
01:26:03,296 --> 01:26:05,667
[reporter 2 over laptop] <i>Today,
in Nashville news, public outcry</i>

1599
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:07,835
<i>after a young man
brought his service monkey</i>

1600
01:26:07,869 --> 01:26:11,304
<i>to a local grocery store
and then to a college party.</i>

1601
01:26:12,172 --> 01:26:14,976
Meet Chloe Gaines,
long time animal activist

1602
01:26:15,009 --> 01:26:17,377
and member of Americans
for Animal Protection.

1603
01:26:17,411 --> 01:26:19,514
On a recent visit
to her local supermarket,

1604
01:26:19,547 --> 01:26:21,949
<i>she encountered 23-year-old
Nate Gibson</i>

1605
01:26:21,983 --> 01:26:23,518
<i>and his capuchin companion Gigi.</i>

1606

[reporter 4 over TV] <i>And finally</i>

<i>the tale of a Tennessee man
and his capuchin monkey</i>

1608
01:26:27,689 --> 01:26:29,724
<i>that went viral
over the weekend.</i>

1609
01:26:29,757 --> 01:26:32,593
<i>It's re-igniting the debate
over what constitutes</i>

1610
01:26:32,627 --> 01:26:34,762
<i>a service animal
in this country.</i>

1611
01:26:34,796 --> 01:26:35,863
[doorbell rings]

1612
01:26:38,666 --> 01:26:41,569
Hi, um, Mrs. Gibson.
I'm... I'm Lori.

1613
01:26:41,602 --> 01:26:45,405
[chuckles softly]
I know who you are. Um...

1614
01:26:45,673 --> 01:26:47,508
well, uh,
Nate is just in the other room.

1615
01:26:47,542 --> 01:26:48,976
We weren't expecting company,
so...

1616
01:26:49,010 --> 01:26:52,379
Yeah, I'm not actually here
to... to talk to Nate.

1617
01:26:52,412 --> 01:26:53,681
[crickets chirping]

1618
01:26:54,949 --> 01:26:56,851
I'm... I'm so sorry.

1619
01:26:57,417 --> 01:26:59,721
I'm the person
that invited Nate to the party,

1620
01:26:59,754 --> 01:27:01,923
and... and I'm the one
who told him to bring Gigi,

1621
01:27:01,956 --> 01:27:04,458
so all these videos coming out,
that's kind of my fault.

1622
01:27:04,491 --> 01:27:07,662
And I've been watching the news
and it... it sucks.

1623
01:27:09,329 --> 01:27:10,932
I... I really don't wanna see
anything bad

1624
01:27:10,965 --> 01:27:13,501
happen to Nate or... or Gigi.

1625
01:27:13,534 --> 01:27:14,736
Well...

1626
01:27:15,335 --> 01:27:17,270
it's a little bit
too late for that.

1627
01:27:17,505 --> 01:27:21,676
I mean, they're already talking
about changing the law tomorrow,

1628
01:27:21,709 --> 01:27:23,477
so that we can't have
a service monkey.

1629
01:27:23,511 --> 01:27:24,712
Look, you... you have to fight.

1630
01:27:27,849 --> 01:27:29,784
You can't just let them do that.

1631
01:27:29,817 --> 01:27:32,520
And I swear to God, I'm not here
to make things worse,

1632
01:27:32,553 --> 01:27:33,921
but you just...
You gotta promise me

1633
01:27:33,955 --> 01:27:35,556
that you're gonna talk to Nate,
okay?

1634
01:27:35,590 --> 01:27:36,657
You're gonna tell him.

1635
01:27:36,691 --> 01:27:38,793
You're gonna tell him
that he just can't give up.

1636
01:27:39,127 --> 01:27:41,294
Look, just, please,
I... I have to go.

1637
01:27:43,064 --> 01:27:44,866
[footsteps receding]

1638
01:27:46,868 --> 01:27:50,671
[dramatic music playing]

1639
01:27:50,705 --> 01:27:53,841
- [reporter speaking over laptop]
- [Claire breathes deeply] Nate.

1640
01:27:55,877 --> 01:27:57,845
You are speaking
to that Committee tomorrow.

1641
01:27:58,411 --> 01:28:00,380
Ten a.m., Capitol building.

1642
01:28:00,413 --> 01:28:01,816
[Nogo]
<i>Doesn't he have to be invited?</i>

1643
01:28:01,849 --> 01:28:02,850
[Claire] <i>He will be.</i>

1644
01:28:03,718 --> 01:28:05,019
Start writing.

1645
01:28:06,954 --> 01:28:08,623
[keyboard clacking]

1646
01:28:12,459 --> 01:28:14,729
[siren blaring]

1647
01:28:14,762 --> 01:28:16,396
[indistinct chatter]

1648
01:28:20,467 --> 01:28:22,603
[reporter] Nate. Mr. Gibson.
What are you doing here?

1649
01:28:22,904 --> 01:28:25,072
Um, I'm testifying
to the Committee.

1650
01:28:25,106 --> 01:28:26,607
What are you going to say?

1651
01:28:26,641 --> 01:28:27,975
I'm gonna say the truth.

1652
01:28:28,009 --> 01:28:29,844
[Dan] Right, thank you.
Thank you very much.

1653
01:28:33,948 --> 01:28:36,751
Capuchins are highly intelligent
and social.

1654
01:28:36,784 --> 01:28:38,753
They're among the smartest
of all the primates.

1655
01:28:38,786 --> 01:28:39,754
And the idea

1656
01:28:39,787 --> 01:28:41,789
of trying to make them
subservient to humans

1657
01:28:41,823 --> 01:28:44,357
is not only unnatural,
it's immoral.

1658
01:28:44,826 --> 01:28:46,561
Morality isn't the question.

1659
01:28:46,594 --> 01:28:48,696
It's whether or not they pose
a danger to the public.

1660
01:28:48,729 --> 01:28:50,865
Well, that goes back to the bond
with the mother

1661
01:28:50,898 --> 01:28:52,465
that I talked about.

1662
01:28:52,499 --> 01:28:55,670
When you take a baby capuchin
away at a young age,

1663
01:28:55,703 --> 01:28:59,006
you remove any chance they have
for normal development.

1664
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:00,775
And that's a ticking time bomb.

1665
01:29:01,474 --> 01:29:04,411
We're not making a decision
in a vacuum, are we?

1666
01:29:04,444 --> 01:29:06,413
What about the well-being
of this young man here?

1667
01:29:06,747 --> 01:29:09,482
Don't we owe him
a duty of consideration?

1668
01:29:09,517 --> 01:29:10,952
Certainly, we have sympathy

1669
01:29:10,985 --> 01:29:12,887
for Mr. Gibson
and his situation.

1670
01:29:14,789 --> 01:29:16,423
We wouldn't be human
if we didn't.

1671
01:29:17,124 --> 01:29:21,028
But the unfortunate truth here
is that this isn't about him.

1672
01:29:21,529 --> 01:29:23,731
It's about
protecting the public.

1673
01:29:24,866 --> 01:29:26,133
Simply put,

1674
01:29:26,567 --> 01:29:28,769
no amount of training

1675
01:29:28,803 --> 01:29:31,606
can ever remove the risk
of attack by a capuchin.

1676
01:29:32,139 --> 01:29:33,708
And it's not their fault.

1677
01:29:33,941 --> 01:29:36,476
They belong in the wild
and not in our homes.

1678
01:29:37,410 --> 01:29:39,747
That's why we urge you
to pass this bill.

1679
01:29:40,648 --> 01:29:42,116
It's the right thing to do

1680
01:29:42,149 --> 01:29:44,384
and it's the right time
to do it.

1681
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:49,489
- Thank you.
- [audience cheers, applauds]

1682
01:29:49,523 --> 01:29:50,725
[Chairman Filling] Order!

1683
01:29:51,491 --> 01:29:52,660
Order!

1684
01:29:52,693 --> 01:29:54,595
Order, please!

1685
01:29:55,897 --> 01:29:58,032
Next on the list is Nate Gibson.

1686
01:30:00,467 --> 01:30:06,007
[scattered applause]

1687
01:30:11,112 --> 01:30:12,179
[Nate clears throat]

1688
01:30:13,948 --> 01:30:15,650
My name is Nate Gibson.

1689
01:30:16,150 --> 01:30:17,919
Uh, I'm 23 years old.

1690
01:30:17,952 --> 01:30:20,521
I've been in this wheelchair
since I was 18.

1691
01:30:20,988 --> 01:30:22,590
When I got paralyzed,

1692
01:30:22,623 --> 01:30:24,725
I was six weeks away
from college.

1693
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:28,529
I ran track,
and then I couldn't.

1694
01:30:30,164 --> 01:30:31,065
My body was a wreck.

1695
01:30:31,332 --> 01:30:33,734
I couldn't feed myself,
I couldn't go to the bathroom.

1696
01:30:34,201 --> 01:30:38,172
I had nurses take care of me
around the clock.

1697
01:30:40,508 --> 01:30:41,876
My mind was a wreck, too.

1698
01:30:44,812 --> 01:30:47,214
I actually tried to kill myself
at one point, but...

1699
01:30:49,583 --> 01:30:51,719
luckily my parents
were there to save me.

1700
01:30:52,987 --> 01:30:55,690
Though, at the time,
it did not feel so lucky.

1701
01:31:02,797 --> 01:31:06,534
And then one year ago,
my life completely changed.

1702
01:31:07,268 --> 01:31:08,769
That's when I got Gigi.

1703
01:31:09,370 --> 01:31:11,706
She is eight-year-old capuchin,

1704
01:31:12,206 --> 01:31:14,508
trained by the amazing people
at Cebus.

1705
01:31:15,776 --> 01:31:17,545
And they taught her
to look after me.

1706
01:31:18,379 --> 01:31:20,480
The only reason
I can move my arms now

1707
01:31:20,748 --> 01:31:22,249
is... is because of Gigi.

1708
01:31:24,218 --> 01:31:26,187
But that's not the best part
about her.

1709
01:31:28,656 --> 01:31:30,958
She gave me a reason
to wake up...

1710
01:31:33,094 --> 01:31:34,195
every day.

1711
01:31:34,395 --> 01:31:36,564
To take care of her.

1712
01:31:36,597 --> 01:31:38,232
To, um, pet her, play with her.

1713
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:41,602
Gigi is a vital member
of our family.

1714
01:31:42,636 --> 01:31:43,704
She provides a service.

1715
01:31:43,938 --> 01:31:46,774
She allows me to live my life
to the fullest every single day.

1716
01:31:47,608 --> 01:31:50,678
And if the idea is to somehow
make that against the law...

1717
01:31:51,979 --> 01:31:55,282
well, then something is truly,
truly wrong.

1718
01:31:55,316 --> 01:31:58,886
Mr. Gibson, you heard
Ms. Gaines testify, correct?

1719
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:00,121
Yes, Ma'am.

1720
01:32:00,154 --> 01:32:02,289
So, you understand our job here

1721
01:32:02,323 --> 01:32:05,292
is to protect the health
and safety of the public.

1722
01:32:06,927 --> 01:32:09,163
Do you think capuchins
are dangerous?

1723
01:32:09,196 --> 01:32:10,664
No.

1724
01:32:10,698 --> 01:32:12,833
But you can see
the same statistics we do.

1725
01:32:13,401 --> 01:32:16,203
Over 300 people injured
with pet monkeys

1726
01:32:16,237 --> 01:32:18,072
over the last 20 years
in this country.

1727
01:32:18,105 --> 01:32:20,841
Gigi's a service animal,
not a pet.

1728
01:32:21,308 --> 01:32:23,844
No different than a guide dog
for a blind person.

1729
01:32:23,878 --> 01:32:25,846
[Senator Parsons]
But she is different, isn't she?

1730
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:27,314
She's much smarter,
isn't that right?

1731
01:32:27,848 --> 01:32:29,617
Yes, she... yes, she is. She...

1732
01:32:29,650 --> 01:32:31,619
Actually, I had to
put a password on my phone

1733
01:32:31,652 --> 01:32:32,987
'cause she figured out
how to order

1734
01:32:33,020 --> 01:32:34,221
pizza on my Domino's app.

1735
01:32:34,255 --> 01:32:35,823
[audience laughs]

1736
01:32:35,856 --> 01:32:37,224
But isn't that the problem?

1737
01:32:37,958 --> 01:32:40,327
We have these
highly intelligent animals

1738
01:32:40,361 --> 01:32:42,163
that live in groups in the wild.

1739
01:32:42,196 --> 01:32:43,697
We put 'em in cages,

1740
01:32:43,731 --> 01:32:45,733
and they become frustrated
and bored.

1741
01:32:45,766 --> 01:32:47,802
Then they lash out
and someone gets hurt.

1742
01:32:48,069 --> 01:32:49,603
Then their owners abandon them

1743
01:32:49,637 --> 01:32:51,172
and the state has to
deal with it.

1744
01:32:51,405 --> 01:32:53,641
Well, shouldn't you be going
after the owners?

1745
01:32:54,308 --> 01:32:56,243
It's like when
a parent abuses their kid.

1746
01:32:56,277 --> 01:32:58,879
You don't arrest the kid,
do you?

1747
01:32:59,580 --> 01:33:02,917
And... and... and Gigi
wasn't taken from her mother.

1748
01:33:03,884 --> 01:33:05,286
She's a rescue.

1749
01:33:05,319 --> 01:33:06,921
She wouldn't even be alive

1750
01:33:06,954 --> 01:33:08,889
if it weren't
for the people at Cebus.

1751
01:33:08,923 --> 01:33:10,891
I have to say,
I think it's inhumane

1752
01:33:10,925 --> 01:33:13,094
to let people
put these animals in cages.

1753
01:33:15,029 --> 01:33:17,164
Well, what about a zoo?
What about a circus?

1754
01:33:17,198 --> 01:33:18,365
What about a wildlife park?

1755
01:33:18,399 --> 01:33:20,034
Every single one of those
is legal.

1756
01:33:20,067 --> 01:33:22,036
[Senator Barnes]
I suspect if they get their way

1757
01:33:22,069 --> 01:33:23,337
we'll outlaw those, too.

1758
01:33:24,004 --> 01:33:26,640
That is what I don't understand.
Why do they get to say

1759
01:33:26,674 --> 01:33:28,642
what is right for an animal
they don't even know?

1760
01:33:28,676 --> 01:33:30,978
- Who died and made them God?
- [audience muttering]

1761
01:33:31,245 --> 01:33:32,880
[Chairman Filling] Order please.

1762
01:33:32,913 --> 01:33:33,848
Mr. Gibson.

1763
01:33:33,881 --> 01:33:35,950
No, like, if you wanna be vegan
or whatever,

1764
01:33:35,983 --> 01:33:38,819
and not wear leather,
that's fine. It's your choice.

1765
01:33:38,853 --> 01:33:40,788
But you do not have the right
to make that choice for me.

1766
01:33:40,821 --> 01:33:41,655
It's not fair.

1767
01:33:41,689 --> 01:33:43,624
I think
we're getting off track here.

1768
01:33:43,824 --> 01:33:46,193
The law already bans gorillas,

1769
01:33:46,393 --> 01:33:47,995
orangutans, chimps, and gibbons.

1770
01:33:48,762 --> 01:33:50,197
The question is

1771
01:33:50,231 --> 01:33:53,234
whether to expand it
to include all primates.

1772
01:33:55,369 --> 01:33:57,771
Excuse me, Ma'am.
Yes, I have read the statute.

1773
01:33:58,405 --> 01:33:59,974
It says you can't own

1774
01:34:00,007 --> 01:34:01,909
inherently dangerous animals.

1775
01:34:01,942 --> 01:34:04,111
Lions, tigers, hippos, bears.

1776
01:34:04,912 --> 01:34:06,447
[soft music playing]

1777
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:09,350
I get that. Their instinct
is to hunt and to kill.

1778
01:34:09,383 --> 01:34:11,118
You know
what Gigi's instinct is?

1779
01:34:14,321 --> 01:34:15,389
It's... It's to help.

1780
01:34:19,226 --> 01:34:22,997
It's to scratch an itch
I can't reach, or to, um...

1781
01:34:25,299 --> 01:34:28,235
turn the pages of a book
that I'm reading, or... or, uh,

1782
01:34:29,003 --> 01:34:31,939
turn the TV off when she thinks
I'm watching too much.

1783
01:34:34,808 --> 01:34:37,811
She's not some screen
that I stare at, or some robot

1784
01:34:37,845 --> 01:34:40,214
that I order around
to do things for me.

1785
01:34:43,450 --> 01:34:46,887
She's... She's a...
She is a living, breathing...

1786
01:34:47,955 --> 01:34:49,957
creature who has value.

1787
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:54,728
She... she has rights,
she has thoughts.

1788
01:34:57,998 --> 01:35:00,167
She's far more similar to us
than we think.

1789
01:35:09,176 --> 01:35:10,110
Um...

1790
01:35:13,047 --> 01:35:15,883
I wouldn't be here today
if it wasn't for her.

1791
01:35:21,288 --> 01:35:22,156
I wouldn't.

1792
01:35:22,524 --> 01:35:25,092
And you were right earlier
when you said it's not about me.

1793
01:35:27,361 --> 01:35:30,164
Like, it's... it's not. It's
about something much bigger.

1794
01:35:30,197 --> 01:35:34,235
It's about our connection,
it's about our interaction,

1795
01:35:34,268 --> 01:35:35,936
it's about our evolution.

1796
01:35:42,544 --> 01:35:43,811

1797
01:35:46,013 --> 01:35:48,349

1800
01:35:57,057 --> 01:35:59,093
Think I went on too... too long?

1801
01:36:00,528 --> 01:36:02,530
No, you didn't.

1802
01:36:06,834 --> 01:36:08,435
I've never heard most

1803
01:36:08,670 --> 01:36:11,972
of that stuff before
and I just...

1804
01:36:14,041 --> 01:36:15,409
I didn't understand.

1805
01:36:17,478 --> 01:36:18,779
It's okay.

1806
01:36:20,180 --> 01:36:24,318
You're amazing,
and I'm so proud of you.

1807

I just wanted
to say congratulations.

I don't really know what all
just happened in there, but...

1816

I'm sorry.

1817

It's not personal.

1818

Oh, yes, it is personal.

1819

It's very personal.

1820
01:37:38,859 --> 01:37:41,195
And I don't want you
to ever forget that.

1821

We will be fighting this.

We will.
We will be fighting this.

You have to fix it.
