00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:53,157
Boom, kaboom. Cool.

175
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,618
Dude, thank you. Great. Yeah.

176
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:59,079
You wanna play some
PS3 or something?

177
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,123
[Man] Let me tell you a story.
[Monica] Okay.

178
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,584
I was in Miami covering Haiti.

179
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,086
Did you then go to Haiti?

180
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,255
No. But turns out

181
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:12,051
there was a real story in Miami

182
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:14,803
about transportation to Haiti.
Oh, okay.

183
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:19,308
And Wolf Blitzer
came through the airport.

184
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,770
He did? Yeah.

185
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,605
And I was like, "Hey, Wolf."
He's like, "Barry."

186
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,690
Were you starstruck?
Well, I mean, we go back.

187
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,067
You do? Yeah.

188
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,860
You're friends? Well...

189
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:31,487
You used to be friends? Yeah.

190
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,072
Wow! I mean, we have...

191
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:35,866
We have... I had no...
That's awesome!

192
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:37,534
We're brothers in news.

193
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:39,703
So you used to, like,
hang out or what?

194
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,664
How does that work? Yeah.

195
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,707
I mean, you know...

196
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,334
He'll...

197
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,294
He'll watch a segment of mine,

198
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:51,131
and then, like, I'll see him
on the news that night,

199
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:53,884
and I'll just sort of be, like,
I can see it...

200
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:57,638
that he, like,
was inspired by my piece.

201
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,848
Anyway, he said to me,

202
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,518
"Barry, the news game...

203
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:06,188
it's a marathon, not a sprint."

204
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:10,317
And then he just went right through
airport security, straight to Haiti.

205
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,486
I want you to think
about two things. Okay.

206
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,821
Number one... Yeah.

207
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,698
What's my future look like...

208
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:16,949
Yeah.

209
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,784
With a rock opera guy?

210
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,953
Number two...

211
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,664
What's my future look like
in the news game?

212
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,624
And how to they interrelate?

213
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,838
[Man's voice] Dear Glen,

214
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:33,340
life is dyn-o-mite.

215
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:35,009
Let's be friends again.

216
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:36,468
Hang soon?

217
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:39,388
Love, Dad. Uh, Arnie.

218
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,557
PS, thinking about
getting e-mail.

219
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,891
Worth it?

220
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,268
Nope.

221
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,567
Are you willing
to do anything for this?

222
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,402
I'll do anything. Literally?

223
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,487
Well, yeah. I mean...
[chuckling]

224
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,114
I will... Crazy.

225
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,825
Well, I will train
and run the marathon.

226
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,618
Will you murder Richard? No.

227
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:04,371
What do we got, Richard?
How we doing?

228
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:08,625
This common coffeemaker could turn
itself on and start a house fire.

229
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:12,129
Kitchen sponge teeming
with E.coli bacteria.

230
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,547
It's good. It's scarier.

231
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,841
Yeah, it's a lot scarier. Yeah.

232
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,259
Ls your kitchen killing you?

233
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:20,304
Um, by the way,

234
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:23,307
a bunch of us are going out
to Banana Joe's for cocktails.

235
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,641
Oh, really? Tonight? Yeah.

236
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,518
You should come.

237
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:29,063
Normally, I would totally
be there slurping away.

238
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:31,982
But Fitz is not over
his band breaking up,

239
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,943
and I have to be
his support system right now.

240
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:39,490
You know, networking
is a big part of network news.

241
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:40,574
Right.

242
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,583
Oh, no, thank you.

243
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:53,420
I'm writing about this lady who has
a cookie jar museum in her garage.

244
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:54,922
I wanna go to that. I know.

245
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,840
It's cool, right?
It's really cool.

246
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,635
You look really cute.
You look cute in this hat. Yeah?

247
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,345
Mm-hmm. I feel like a sailor.

248
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,473
You look like you're in
the Perfect Storm.

249
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,564
Hey, it's late.

250
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,572
Okay, I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna set the alarm.

251
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:23,450
I'm gonna take a melatonin,
you're gonna brush your teeth,

252
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:25,160
and then we'll meet
in the bedroom.

253
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,037
Does that sound good? Okay.

254
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:29,957
Okay. I'm gonna be a dining
room virgin forever.

255
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,043
[phone ringing]

256
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:37,923
What's up, dude?

257
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,512
Yeah, I have Kermit.

258
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:47,349
Uh, usually I don't,

259
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:51,770
uh, deal in that much
Kermit the Frog.

260
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,776
Did you read newest draft
of my thing?

261
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:00,362
It's a very incoherent
and very bad rock opera.

262
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:03,532
I'm gonna just tell it to you straight,
because that's what they teach me here.

263
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,200
Your rock opera
is really terrible.

264
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,202
It's a really terrible
piece of work.

265
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:10,497
It's not terrible. Look at me.
It's really terrible.

266
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,333
You didn't like the new character?
No, I didn't.

267
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:17,171
The traitor? The traitor, who
is based obviously on me.

268
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:19,506
Oh, get over yourself.
It's totally based on Snapes.

269
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:20,924
Snape? Yeah.

270
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,634
From Harry Potter? Yes.

271
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,845
I'm not a narcissist.
A faggy praying mantis

272
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,181
with a Bluetooth
walks onto the stage.

273
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:29,266
Yeah. And he used to be down.
Now he's not down.

274
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,393
Okay, you go take it to fucking

275
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:35,230
the Dumbledore in your life,
if I'm Snape, okay?

276
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:38,734
You don't come to the person you're
ridiculing to finance that project.

277
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,069
Look, I'll tell you something.
Everybody comes to me with favors.

278
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,780
Everybody wants favors.
Everyone wants me to grease wheels for them.

279
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:46,325
What about
when I was in Tor Eagle?

280
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:49,703
You guys would stonewall me.
You wanted my brains, you wanted me to book the gigs,

281
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:53,123
you wanted me to use my fucking Quicken
program to balance our checkbook,

282
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,292
but when it came time
for you to pony up

283
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,294
on a song that I wrote, oh, no.

284
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:00,631
You're stuff sounded
like reggaeton, dude.

285
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,424
That's my culture.

286
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,635
That is not your culture.
That's my culture.

287
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,846
Your parents are from Connecticut.
But my nanny is from Haiti.

288
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:14,186
I'm sorry. I didn't know
that you felt like that.

289
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,855
Yeah. So I apologize.

290
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,191
Apology accepted, "mon."

291
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,151
[laughing]

292
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:23,862
God, look at her.
I need the strongest stuff you have.

293
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:26,114
Give me the Jamaican Dank
or whatever the fuck,

294
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,075
because she's gonna need
a lot of coaxing.

295
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,952
You know what I mean?
Good Lord.

296
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,078
Yeah.

297
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,663
What do I owe you?

298
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:35,207
Nothing. I'm not a drug dealer.

299
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,209
You are a drug dealer.
I'm not a drug dealer.

300
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,503
You have a backpack
full of weed, right?

301
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:42,047
I like weed. And sometimes my
friends need me to hook them up.

302
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,799
You got a three-day beard, right?
Yeah.

303
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:46,218
Sort of directionless in your life?
Sort of.

304
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,720
Pissed off at your dad? Yeah.

305
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:51,306
You're a drug dealer.
No. I'm an artist.

306
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,439
Triangles, dude, everywhere.

307
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,858
Lakers, D-Fish, Kobe, Pau.

308
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:04,695
Phil Knight is a big supporter
of my triangle theory.

309
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:07,030
It's Phil Jackson, first of all,
and second... Phil Knight.

310
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,324
Who's Phil Knight? Nike guy.
He started Nike.

311
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,034
I'm thinking of Phil Jackson.

312
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:13,120
Okay, now we're just
getting way off topic.

313
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:16,999
Nike's swoosh is based on a triangle.
Did you know that?

314
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,376
It's, like, a check.
It's based off a check.

315
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,837
It's got a point on the back.
Not everything's triangles, dude.

316
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,964
You don't believe
in the triangle theory...

317
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,258
Because it doesn't make sense.
It does make sense.

318
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:27,759
Okay. All right.
Are you listening?

319
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,803
Yeah. I got a triangle for you.

320
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:33,140
It's you, a piece of dog shit
and another piece of dog shit.

321
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:35,350
That's not... That doesn't work?

322
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:38,228
No, 'cause me and the dog shit don't
have... There's three segments.

323
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,647
Fitz, why weren't you here
for the couch delivery? Ohh!

324
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:43,609
I don't understand.
Tommy and Richie both have real jobs.

325
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,861
They have shitty jobs.
Tommy's job is bullshit.

326
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,863
What about the five-year plan?

327
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,115
What five-year plan?
Our five-year plan.

328
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:54,286
I don't have a five-year plan.
I've never had an any plan.

329
00:15:56,289 --> 00:16:00,167
Just gonna buy some stuff.

330
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,713
What's up?

331
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,799
Sorry I'm late.
My girlfriend was yelling at me.

332
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:10,510
Terrible, dude.
Happens all the time.

333
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,721
Sorry to hear that, bro.
She used to be so cool.

334
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:16,683
Yeah. I guess that's why
my policy is bros only.

335
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,226
Makes sense. You're lucky.

336
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,896
[quietly] So, uh, you got it?
Yeah.

337
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,815
Hey, do you think
that your nephew

338
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,319
would like this
for his quinceañera, Ramón?

339
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:30,030
[Ramón whispering] Shut up.
Don't say my name, dude.

340
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,907
Sorry. Sorry.

341
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,826
She used to be, like, so
fucking cool when we met.

342
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:37,954
She'd, like, come to my shows, and,
like, she'd sell merch and stuff.

343
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:41,458
Yeah. Now she's got this,
like, fucking news job.

344
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,418
[Ramón] That sucks, dude.
Listen, I gotta go.

345
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,838
I'm running late
for Bonnaroo, okay?

346
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,757
Do you have it or don't you?
Yes, I have it.

347
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,509
All right. I have the money.
Let's go.

348
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,678
I'm in a rush, too.
I have stuff to do as well.

349
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,429
Hey, we all got
something to do, right?

350
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,223
I know. It's busy.
I'm really busy right now.

351
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,308
I'm working on my rock opera.
It's all here.

352
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:00,852
What are you doing?
There's a fucking camera right there.

353
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:04,106
Maybe I should stop doing this.

354
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:08,110
Come on, man. You got it or you don't?
I gotta go.

355
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,779
We should figure out something
to do together.

356
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,656
Yeah, that'd be great.
I really gotta go.

357
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,075
Okay. I don't like selling this much.
All right?

358
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,868
Later, bro. Have fun.

359
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,706
[chuckling] Yeah.

360
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,460
Good one.

361
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:29,005
This is gonna be a great day.
[police radio chatter]

362
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,966
Hang on a second.
Police officer.

363
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,634
Mind if we ask you a couple
questions here today?

364
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,344
Take your hands off. No, dude.

365
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:36,138
Oh, what's this?
That's not mine, man.

366
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,181
Oh. That's not mine.

367
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:39,891
That's the real shit.

368
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,518
[Ramón] No, no, no, dude.

369
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,646
Both hands on the car.
Spread your legs.

370
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,440
You guys are under arrest.
Spread your fucking legs.

371
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:50,694
Hey, why don't you
profile that guy?

372
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,821
Officer, right? Go check...

373
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,323
Yeah. Go check him out.
Hey, you, in the stripes!

374
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:58,952
Hey! Police!
[Ramón] It's not Arizona, man.

375
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:02,080
Come here!

376
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,501
Fuck it.

377
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,087
[handcuffs click]
Ow! Hey, come on, man!

378
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:11,089
He's clean. I got him.

379
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:12,883
Okay. We're all good.

380
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:15,343
All right. Come on. Let's go.
This is bullshit.

381
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,054
[Father]
All right. Unlock the door.

382
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:20,474
I can't. It's locked.
What the hell are you doing home?

383
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:21,892
Why aren't you at school?

384
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:24,227
They let us out early. Really?

385
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:27,439
They let you out early, huh?
Like the morning. Y'all came for one hour?

386
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,484
I just got a call from your
principal there, smart guy.

387
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:32,986
You know what he said?

388
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,071
That I'm a smart guy?

389
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:49,920
Hey. Hey.

390
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:52,172
Grab my weed. Grab all my weed.

391
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,132
Fitz... Grab all my weed!
Grab all my weed!

392
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,593
Fitz, you're sweating!
Oh, my God! All my weed.

393
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,262
I know. I've been running.
I sold Ramón

394
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:00,972
kind of a lot of weed,

395
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,641
and he just got arrested
by the cops.

396
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,476
And he's not a great guy, so...

397
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,771
Fitz, what are you talking about?
Where is it?

398
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,523
Everywhere.

399
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,107
Look everywhere. Everywhere?

400
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:13,068
I think I might
have to go to Oakland

401
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,070
for a while.

402
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,947
What are you talking about?
Oakland?

403
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:20,200
Yeah. I have some friends
that live there. For what?

404
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,077
Just to hide.
Hey, those are my sausage links.

405
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,037
No, this is hash.

406
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,373
[Father] You know what, Jimmy?
This is it. All right?

407
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:28,416
You're going to military school.
There it is.

408
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:30,544
Awesome. Thanks, Dad.
Finally. There it is. Done.

409
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,046
That's your solution for everything.
We talked about it.

410
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,131
You're bringing this
on yourself.

411
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:37,676
I'm not the one who couldn't play baseball.
It's all my fault.

412
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,136
I'm not the one who's out
there failing his classes

413
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:42,597
and skipping school.

414
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,266
You're going to military
school, and that's it.

415
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,351
Is this whole house
made of weed?

416
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,270
Fucking Ramón!
What are you doing?

417
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:51,106
I'm clearing away my stuff.
Hold this.

[doorbell rings]

I don't know.
It's the fucking cops.

No, it's the couch guy.
Well, get rid of him!

423
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:04,911
We're gonna figure this out.
It's gonna be okay.

424
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:09,040
Okay. Fine.

425
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,293
Get the couch guy.
I'll meet you down there.

426
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:12,627
Okay. All right. Thank you.

427
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:16,381
I love you.

428
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,350
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

429
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:29,060
Why is the garage door closed?

430
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,605
I can't hang out today, man.
What's going on?

431
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:33,523
This creepy guy was following me.
Oh, yeah?

432
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,859
Yeah. I gotta go see
my friend in Oakland.

433
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:38,111
You're going to Oakland? Yeah.

434
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,030
Can I come? No, man. Take off.

435
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:42,032

No. Jimmy, get the fuck outta here.

He's the molester!

You calm down.
And you back off!

This is my driveway.
Get the fuck outta here.

442
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:55,629
I'm gonna knock the shit outta you!
You're not gonna do shit!

443
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:56,880
Shut the fuck up, all right?
Okay.

444
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,214
Are you calm? Yeah.

445
00:20:58,299 --> 00:20:59,758
I want you calm. I'm calm!

446
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,426
I'm gonna let you go.
You understand?

447
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,011
I don't want any trouble. Okay.

Where do you think
you're going, huh?

Oh! Oh, God.

Dude, I just knocked
that fucking guy out!

That's my dad. What?

He is a fucking creep. He beats the shit out of me.
He's been on a bender lately.

You gotta take me with you.
Fuck, no, dude!

Get outta here! Take me to Oakland.
My mom lives in Oakland.

I gotta go to Oakland.
He's waking up!

No, you're not getting in the car!
Why?

00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:45,757
I got no pockets.
I don't have my phone. What's wrong?

509
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,258
Run some drills.

510
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:49,052
Cardio. Some interval training.

511
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,762
What happened to your head?

512
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,972
Yeah. I'll tell you
what happened to my head.

513
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:55,600
I went down to get Jimmy...
The kid has so much potential.

514
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,435
You don't have to tell me!
I know, man!

515
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,771
He's going off the rails!
Smart kid and...

516
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,773
I went to get him,
and I'm running his ass home,

517
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,900
because I'm sending him
to fucking military school!

518
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,985
What's gotta be done
is gotta be done.

519
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,530
But then I get out in the alley,
and this fucking drugger...

520
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:11,199
some drug-head
comes at me sideways.

521
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,201
Didn't see it.
Sucker punches me

522
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,953
with a fucking brick
in the head!

523
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:17,205
Oh, goddamn.
I went down like a sack of rocks.

524
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,707
I'm fucking embarrassed.
But as I came to,

525
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:23,128
I looked, and Jimmy is in the
fucking car with this guy...

526
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:25,046
What?
...and they're taking off.

527
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:27,090
So Jimmy's been kidnapped?
Well, I don't know that.

528
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:29,092
Definitely been kidnapped.
That's what I'm worried about.

529
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,927
Maybe he was.
He's abducted. Okay.

530
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,804
Do you have some detective
friends I can talk to?

531
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:35,515
I do, but I
could help you, Jim.

532
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,934
I graduated the academy.
I can help you. I don't know...

533
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,769
I have interrogation
techniques, forensics.

534
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:41,729
I can do this. You run the gym.

535
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:44,149
I need a detective. Yeah. Yeah.

536
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:45,775
Come on. Let's do this.

537
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,236
You have anything?
Any leads? Anything?

538
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,737
Yeah. I got the license plate.

539
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:52,240
You got the license plate?
Yeah.

540
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:55,201
We're way ahead of the game.
Let me sign out of Facebook.

541
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:56,870
Also, I got a description
of the guy, too.

542
00:24:56,954 --> 00:24:59,289
See? Already.
You see it's going?

543
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:01,416
[Jim] Why is it so slow?

544
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,543
It's DSL. It does what we
need it to do in the gym.

545
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:06,421
[Fitz]
Rich is, like, really cool.

546
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,590
I mean that in a totally
not-gay way.

547
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:10,758
It didn't even sound gay.
You said he was a cool guy.

548
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,845
If you don't think that sounded
gay, then this will sound gay.

549
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,598
If I had to fuck one guy,
it would definitely be Rich.

550
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,641
That was really gay.
If I did, I...

551
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:21,019
Okay. So, in not a gay way.

552
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:23,646
You didn't have to say that just because
I said the other thing wasn't gay.

553
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:25,481
I was gonna say it anyway.

554
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:27,609
You just had to top your
gayness for no reason.

555
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:29,611
I did not. That's what you did.

556
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,279
You ever heard my EP?

557
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,239
No. Finally. It's awesome.

558
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:36,326
I made this when I was 19.
First song is about my mom.

559
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:41,915
♪ I heard you sayin'
I don't like romance ♪

560
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:44,876
♪ Well, I love, well, I love ♪

561
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,544
It's not bad.

562
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:50,298

00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:53,009

566
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,474
I gotta get on
the DMV Web site.

567
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,767
Uh...

568
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:02,227
DSL. We're almost there.

569
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,270
Okay. When did this happen?

570
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:06,105
About 45 minutes ago.

571
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,483
45. Bup, bup, bup...
Two hours and 15 minutes.

572
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,027
Okay. It's great that you
came here immediately.

573
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:13,988
The first three hours of any abduction
is what they call the kill zone.

574
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:16,199
A very dangerous time. What?

575
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:19,160
It's a crucial time.
So we gotta find this person in this time...

576
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:20,703
I've never heard
of any kill zone.

577
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:23,122
What the fuck
are you talking about?

578
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:26,668
Well, it's the kill zone.
This is where people are stabbed, shot, murdered.

579
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:30,004
This is when the perpetrator
usually panics

580
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,173
and goes off his rocker...
All right. Shut up.

581
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:34,175
Don't talk about
the kill zone anymore.

582
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,552
That fucking bugs me.
I don't know what happened to him.

583
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:38,513
It's also 90%
of the sexual crimes happen...

584
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,307
Shut the fuck up, Fogerty!
I'm just trying to be honest.

585
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,851
That's my son!
Well, he's a good-looking kid.

586
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,812
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

587
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:47,897
Are you out of your fucking mind?
I'm not.

588
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:50,692
I don't mean to get
your feathers all riled up.

589
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,694
Well, you did, asshole!
I didn't mean to do that.

590
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:54,862
He's not getting raped,
and he's not getting killed!

591
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,864
We don't know what's happening
to him right now.

592
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:58,491
We don't know,
so quit saying it!

593
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,785
That's why it's crucial
that we find out.

594
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,996
What do you mean, he's a good-looking kid?
What are you talking about?

595
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,790
We got one more guy
that's gotta crash this party.

596
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,375
A guy by the name
of Boston Johnny.

597
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,210
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

598
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:11,296
I didn't think you were
allowed to carry that.

599
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,799
Not through the department.
But I do have this registered.

600
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:17,927
It's not the department.
It's a legal entity. It doesn't matter.

601
00:27:18,012 --> 00:27:20,596
It's legal. I got a permit. Take this.
I don't have any pockets.

602
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:23,599
Okay. Great.
I don't wanna see that, by the way.

603
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:25,935
You won't see it
unless you have to see it,

604
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,563
unless he makes me
show him this.

605
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,940
Rico, I'm back in 20 minutes.
Gotta run an errand.

606
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,822
Whoa.

607
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:42,410
Are you okay? No.

608
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:45,455
Come on. Come on.
Come here. [Crying]

609
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:48,666
Jeff, Maryanne,
can you guys give us a second?

610
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,088
Thank you. [Door closes]

611
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:56,507
I'm embarrassed. Why?

612
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,261
It's just emotions coming out.

613
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:02,013
It's okay. Yeah.

614
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,931
Talk to Barry.

615
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:07,518
Well, it's Fitz.

616
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:12,940
He's been dealing weed... Okay.

617
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:15,943
And it was all over our house.

618
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:18,780
And I don't know
where he is right now.

619
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:21,324
Where is he?
And I'm freaked out.

620
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,993
He left. He won't answer
any of my phone calls.

621
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:25,703
You should call him

622
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:29,290
And I don't know what to do.
I'm pregnant.

623
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,376
With his baby? Yeah.

624
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,337
Whoa. Wow.

625
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:37,715
I'm so fucked.
I'm so fucked, Barry.

626
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,760
I don't...
I fucked this up so bad.

627
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:43,388
I have no idea what to do.
There, there.

628
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:45,348
There, there.

629
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:47,809
I just feel like such a
fucking idiot. Just...

630
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:50,478
I fucked everything up.

631
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:54,857
Y-You didn't do anything.

632
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:56,984
I mean, do I even want this?

633
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,945
Do I even want a fucking baby?

634
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:00,738
I don't know. I...

635
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:08,121
Oh...

636
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,333
[mutters]

637
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:15,128
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

638
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:17,004
Ew! Barry!

639
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,798
I... What... [huffs]

640
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:19,799
[disgusted groan]

641
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,259
Barry!

642
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,136
What the fuck? Wah!

643
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,390
[chuckling]
What the crap? Aw, man.

644
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,308
What am I supposed to do?
Should I quit?

645
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:31,811
No. Why would you quit?
You're great at your job.

646
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:34,063
Oh! You're married!

647
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:36,190
Things are really bad
at home with my wife.

648
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:38,151
Ew! I don't need to hear that.

649
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,194
I don't.
You should fucking... I thought...

650
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,405
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

651
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,407
I thought you were
hitting on me.

652
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,075
I'm gonna take a sick day.

653
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,662
Leave, relax.
Totally come back.

654
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,622
Ew, ew, ew.

655
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:53,875
Aah! Aah! Ew! Ew!

656
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,043
It's funny. Weird. What...

657
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,004
It's ridiculous. [Chuckling]

658
00:29:58,088 --> 00:30:00,339
[Jimmy] All the classic bands
like Zeppelin, The Who...

659
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:01,966
I mean,
how do you explain that?

660
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,343
Those are trios.
No, they're not.

661
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:07,096
Front man and guitar
count as one.

662
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:09,765
Your triangle totally
ruined the Godfather series,

663
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:12,560
because that was fine until
it added your third vertices.

664
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,604
Yeah. Of course,
there's bad triangles.

665
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:16,397
75% of the Earth
is covered in water.

666
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:18,274
They still call it Earth.
Hey, what's up?

667
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,860
You got an extra smoke, man?
[scoffs]

668
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:23,696
I buy them at the store.
They come in packs of 20.

669
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,948
You should probably do
the same thing. Okay.

670
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:28,951
Uh, my friends are in there.
I'm just gonna run in and get them.

671
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:31,078
Yeah, it's closed.
There's a rehearsal going on.

672
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:33,247
Yeah, but the people
rehearsing are, like, my buds.

673
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:34,749
Yeah, I got a lot of friends,
too.

674
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,584
Okay.

675
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,836
What, are you doing a chaperone deal?
What's up?

676
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:41,506
No, this is my buddy.
We're friends from college.

677
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,090
College? Yeah.

678
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:46,010
Old college buds.
College of children?

679
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,763
No. Children...

680
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,265
I lost my wallet.
I don't have my I D.

681
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,934
Yeah, no I D, no go in.

682
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:54,685
I recognize you.
I've played here before.

683
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,354
I was in a band
called Tor Eagle.

684
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:58,481
[chuckles]
What does that even mean?

685
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,441
The name of the band
is Tor Eagle.

686
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:03,110
It's, like, the first two
letters of everybody's name.

687
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:05,947
T-O... Tommy. R-I... Richie.

688
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,865
G-L... Glen. That's my name.

689
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,742
Did you guys vote on that?

690
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,244
We made it up when we were 16.

691
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:13,996
♪ ♪ [muted rock]
Sounds about right.

692
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:16,707
If you're not gonna let me in,
can you go get them?

693
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,918
[sighs] Yeah.

694
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,462
Just yell out "Tor Eagle"?

695
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:23,798
I don't know.
His name's Rich. Okay.

696
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,967
Her name's Sheila. Don't move.

697
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:28,261
You want a bicycle
to hang around on or something?

698
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:30,304
All right. I get it. I'm a kid.
Yeah, you're a kid.

699
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:32,306
I'm not gonna go anywhere.
Clear out!

700
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:34,308
He's a fucking asshole. I know.

701
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,561
[Rich] You wanna take a break?
What's up?

702
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:38,563
[Rich, Sheila] Hi.

703
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:40,398
You guys look cool.

704
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:41,941
Thank you. Oh, yeah.

705
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:44,610
We're in a White Stripes
cover band.

706
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:46,737
Awesome.

707
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:48,447
We're called 8th Nation Army.
Get it?

708
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:50,074
'Cause of the song. Yeah. Yeah.

709
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:54,328
Can I talk to you? [Rich] Sure.

710
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,872
Oh, this is Sheila.
Rich, Jimmy.

711
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:58,874
Hi. Is that a kid or something?

712
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,960
This is the gig
that Tommy got you guys?

713
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,462
Yes. And it pays way better
than you think it does.

714
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:05,673
You're in a tribute band? Yes.

715
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,593
And it's actually really fun.
Sheila's good.

716
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,054
[chuckles]

717
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:14,515
Are you feeling a little sad?

718
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,518
I know we just met, but I sort of
have a sense about these things.

719
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:19,770
Some of my friends
consider me kind of a healer.

720
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:21,564
Uh-huh. I'm not certified,

721
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,566
but I usually am
pretty spot-on about them.

722
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,526
Um...

723
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:27,194
Uh, I guess.

724
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,696
You are sad. [Mutters]

725
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,864
Yeah, I can feel it. Sure.

726
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,490
What do you want?

727
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:34,577
I need to borrow your van
for a few days.

728
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:38,539
No. I can't let you
use my van, man.

729
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:41,167
It's only a couple days.
I wouldn't ask you if I didn't need it.

730
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:43,085
I didn't know
I was giving off a sad vibe.

731
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,587
You're confused. Okay.

732
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,881
Things are changing
in your body.

733
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,258
People find that confusing.
Yeah.

734
00:32:49,343 --> 00:32:52,261
I remember being scared to death
when that happened to me.

735
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:53,804
You look at yourself
in the mirror,

736
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:55,806
and you don't
necessarily recognize

737
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:57,433
who's looking back at you.

738
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,143
Facial hair.
You know what else.

739
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:01,562
Can I offer you some advice?

740
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:05,399
So I'm taking him to Oakland
to hang out with his mom,

741
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,818
and I'm gonna chill
with Arnie for a little bit.

742
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:10,237
Your dad Arnie? Yeah.

743
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:12,323
You're gonna go
hang out with your dad?

744
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:15,326
I mean, if that's any indication
about how desperate I am...

745
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,244
Jesus.

746
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,872
Just don't mess up my car.
Okay. I won't.

747
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:22,249
You don't have
any smokes, do you?

748
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:25,044
No. I've got
nicotine gum in the car,

749
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,879
but it tastes like shit.

750
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,465
You have any weed? No. I quit.

751
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,258
I'm just kidding.

752
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,427
Jesus, I was about
to disown you.

753
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,596
I don't have it here with me.
It's at the hotel.

754
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:37,098
That sucks. Yeah.

755
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:39,725
Wanna come to Oakland?

756
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,602
I can't, man.

757
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:43,604
Trust me,
if you eat these things,

758
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:46,482
you'll grow six inches
in six months.

759
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:47,483
Really?

760
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:48,818
Nuts. Nuts.

761
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:51,278
Yeah. Really good for you.

762
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:55,408
Buzz Aldrin... when he landed on the moon,
you know what he had in his pocket?

763
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:57,451
A picture of his family
and nuts.

764
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,453
A picture of his family and nuts.
Mm-hmm.

765
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:02,123
Speaking of hydration,
that's the ticket.

766
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:03,999
Coconut water. That's right.

767
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:06,836
It hydrates you 75 times
faster than normal water.

768
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,879
Really? Mm-hmm.
It says right there.

769
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:11,090
What does that even mean?
It means if you drink that,

770
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,008
it's like drinking
eight bottles of water.

771
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:14,760
Just in this? Yeah.

772
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:17,555
Why is it called Coconut?
It's from a coconut.

773
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,515
Good luck, man. Thanks.

774
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:23,602
Say hi to your dad.
I know, right?

775
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:25,354
Maybe you can play some
milky-milky cakey-cake.

776
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:27,314
[chuckles]
That shit's so weird.

777
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,275
I know. I can't believe it.

778
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,485
Okay, listen.
Just follow my lead.

779
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,487
The most important thing
is to have a calm demeanor.

780
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:35,698
You wanna establish
some trust with the, uh...

781
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:39,285
with the, uh, witness here.
[clears throat]

782
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:41,287
Hey, just don't fuck this up,
all right?

783
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:43,330
Okay.

784
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:45,458
You don't have to
knock that hard.

785
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:46,959
Hi. My name's Peter Fogerty.

786
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,586
I'm with
the sheriff's department.

787
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,463
This is my partner
Deputy Malone.

788
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:52,965
We're here investigating
a missing person's report.

789
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,342
We've traced some license
plates to this residence.

790
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:58,220
It's the LKA
of a Glen Fitzgerald.

791
00:34:58,305 --> 00:35:01,474
Oh, yeah. I know Glen.
What's LKA?

792
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,434
Last known address.
How do you know Glen?

793
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:04,810
Glen's my boyfriend. Terrific.

794
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:06,645
All right. We're on our way.

795
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,355
Where is Glen now?

796
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,399
Oh, I couldn't tell you that.
I have no idea.

797
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:13,319
Really? Well, it's very important
that we find him, because...

798
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:15,613
Look, really, you don't know
where your boyfriend is?

799
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:17,323
Really?

800
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,325
That's what we're figuring out now.
Come on.

801
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:21,660
Are there places of business
that he frequents often

802
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:23,204
that maybe we might
be able to find him?

803
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:25,664
No. Maybe he's shopping...

804
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:28,751
I find that very suspicious that you
wouldn't know where your boyfriend goes.

805
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:31,420
I'm wondering if we can just step inside
real quick and take a look around.

806
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:33,380
No. I'm sorry.
I have to go to work.

807
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,591
Well, there may be an I PP
going on as we speak.

808
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:38,385
What's an... It doesn't
matter what it means.

809
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,679
No. I'm sorry. If you give me a
business card, I can call you.

810
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:44,225
Sure. I'd be happy for you to
take a look at my business card.

811
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:51,023
Hold on a second. If we have to come
back, we're coming back with a warrant.

812
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,983
And we'll see everything!

813
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:56,153
Including the drugs and the pornography!
Hey, calm down.

814
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:59,031
Did you notice there was
a gun in there? Yeah.

815
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,367
I'm pretty sure John Wayne Gacy
had a gun.

816
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,503
He's gone, and he's out
of our lives, right?

817
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,421
And that's for the best,
trust me.

818
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:15,965
I feel like I disappointed you.

819
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:18,092
You disappointed us?
Of course not.

820
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:21,262
[phone ringing] Fitz?

821
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:22,847
[mutters]

822
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:25,307
You don't have anything
to say to him.

823
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,767
Hang up. Who cares where he is.

824
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:28,477
Tell him you're done, good-bye.

825
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:31,063
Hang up the phone.
Just give him the phone.

826
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,274
Give me the phone.
I'd like to have a word with him.

827
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:36,318
Tell him that
he's a piece of shit!

828
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:39,113
Why should I call you?
You're the one that left.

829
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,866
Well, I'm kind of busy
running from the cops.

830
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,868
I'm on the lam.
You're on the lam?

831
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:45,870
What does that mean,
you're on the lam?

832
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:48,122
It means I'm running
from the cops.

833
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:51,208
Jimmy's dad and some fucking maniac
named Fogerty came over today.

834
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:52,751
They say you're a pervert.

835
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:54,378
I'm not a pervert.
He's the pervert.

836
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,463
What's going on?
I'm alone here.

837
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:57,882
Where are you?

838
00:36:57,966 --> 00:37:00,050
I'm, like, halfway to Oakland.

839
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:03,429
Come home! I don't understand.
You tell him he's human garbage.

840
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:06,432
He belongs in a garbage pail.
And he can take that to the bank.

841
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:08,142
He doesn't do a goddamn thing.
Stop!

842
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,768
Get the fuck in the house!

843
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:11,437
All right.

844
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:14,440
Fitz, I don't know
what's going on.

845
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:18,027
I'm really freaked out.
I don't know where you are.

846
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:20,237
I fucking made out with Barry.

847
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:23,073
You made out with Barry?
Yeah. I mean, yeah.

848
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:25,826
I'm gone for six hours, and you
make out with your fucking boss?

849
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:27,202
Fuck.

850
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,748
[click]

851
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:39,131
[Man] 4-1 -1. The Berlin.

852
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:42,092
It's a nightclub.

853
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:01,320
What happened?

854
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,489
My girlfriend made out
with some dick named Barry,

855
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:06,450
who just so happens to be her
fucking boss and really rich!

856
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:10,120
So the next hour, we just
sit here and not talk!

857
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:17,795
They're probably
gonna catch us if we don't...

858
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:19,713
[engine starts] Good note.

859
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:21,423
That sucks
about your girlfriend.

860
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:23,509
Yeah, it sucks. Life sucks.

861
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:28,722
Bingo bango!
We got a text from Rico.

862
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:30,641
Interesting.

863
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,185
Looks like our plates
popped up in Bakersfield.

864
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,145
All right! All right.
Let's hit the highway.

865
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,939
Let's get there quick.

866
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:39,358
Bakersfield just got...
It was in the headlines.

867
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:41,110
They just had a porn sting
in Bakersfield.

868
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:44,071
Everything you say upsets me.

869
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:47,866
You guys... You have good
health insurance, right?

870
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:49,576
Why would you ask that?

871
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,537
I know the circumstances
could be better,

872
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:53,455
but it's kind of great
that we can spend

873
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,416
some time together finally,
you know?

874
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,376
Are you fucking kidding me?

875
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,129
No, I'm not. How many times
do we say we wanna go out

876
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:03,090
and take a road trip or go out
and just get to know each other?

877
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,175
It's been a while.

878
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,886
You think maybe we can hit the
PCH highway on the way back?

879
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:10,139
Beautiful drive.

880
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:12,766
Don't worry about
the PCH fucking highway.

881
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:14,852
Worry about Jimmy!

882
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,817
[Sheila] I'm getting
better at this now.

883
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:25,446
Maybe I can play something
besides just quarter notes.

884
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,948
I mean, if you wanna
try something new,

885
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:29,783
we could, you know, work on it.

886
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:32,369
Do you think we should
send Tommy something?

887
00:39:32,454 --> 00:39:34,747
Like a basket?

888
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:36,540
Yeah, that's a good idea.

889
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:43,047
Maybe just get him...

890
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:47,634
Whoa. [Fogerty] Out of the car.

891
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,595
Piece of shit!
No! I don't know you!

892
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:50,971
Get outta the car!
What the fuck?

893
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:53,015
You fuck... Get out of there.

894
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,142
Come here. Jesus Christ!

895
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:58,270
Is that him?
No, that's not him.

896
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,773
Jesus. Peter Fogerty,
sheriff's department.

897
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:03,275
This is my partner Deputy Malone.
You guys are cops?

898
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,986
That's right. We're cops.
I didn't do shit!

899
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:07,905
We wanna know
if you know a Glen Fitzgerald?

900
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:09,406
Hands! Hands!

901
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:11,366
10:00 and 2:00, missy!
Up! What?

902
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:13,494
[Rich] Hey, she's cool.
I'll put them 10:00 and 2:00.

903
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:15,579
The clock.
Like the clock. Good.

904
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:18,707
Do you know a Glen Fitzgerald?
[Rich] Glen Fitzgerald...

905
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:21,126
You know,
it's not a brainteaser.

906
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:22,836
Yes-or-no question.
Do you know the man or not?

907
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:24,922
Yes, I know him. Yes.
All right.

908
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:26,632
Now, where is Glen Fitzgerald?

909
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:28,926
I don't know.
I haven't seen him. Come on.

910
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,929
You're in his car, the same one he
was in this morning, you asshole.

911
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:33,889
Now, where is he?
Yeah. I don't know, man.

912
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:35,724
He's got my kid, you douche bag!
Speak words.

913
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:37,476
Hey! Oh, my God!

914
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,520
Kicking my...
We switched cars with him!

915
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:41,730
He's going to Oakland to see
Arnie Fitzgerald, his father.

916
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,774
Are you okay?
Why are you telling them that?

917
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,859
Because he kicked you in the stomach!
He didn't kick me.

918
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:47,528
He kicked the shitty car.

919
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:50,531
He can't do anything.
He's in sweatpants.

920
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:52,324
He is in sweatpants. Ma'am...

921
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,409
What? You shut up, and
you please keep talking.

922
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:56,495
And what kind of car
was he driving?

923
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,914
Um... Talk!

924
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:02,501
A yellow car.
That was a Duster.

925
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:04,378
A yellow Duster.
A yellow Duster. Good. Great.

926
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,004
Now we're getting somewhere.
And the plates?

927
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:08,340
Samantha.

928
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,592
He has a plate named Samantha?
Without the vowels.

929
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:13,470
Smnth? Okay.

930
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:15,722
Smnth, yellow Duster,
all right?

931
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:18,809
Hold on. Wait.
What the fuck is with the outfits?

932
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:20,853
Is this some sort of cult? No.

933
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:22,813
We're in a White Stripes
cover band.

934
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:26,233
Yeah. Oh, yeah. The White Stripes.
Sure. The rock duo.

935
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,485
They're brother and sister that
were possibly fucking each other.

936
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:32,197
Some people think they were
husband-wife, husband-ex-wife.

937
00:41:32,282 --> 00:41:34,241
But there was definitely
some kinky shit going on.

938
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,410
Yeah, they're not...
I think it's rock mystique.

939
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:38,495
Gray area.
They got a raw simplicity.

940
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,248
Their composition and
arrangements are really raw.

941
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:43,917
There's two of them.
Who gives a shit about this stuff, all right?

942
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,878
Did you see my boy? Yes.

943
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:48,630
What is it? Did you see him
or didn't you? Yes. Yes!

944
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:51,383
I don't think you understand
what you're dealing with.

945
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,927
Oh, my... I don't think you do
understand what you're dealing with.

946
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:56,180
Do you have a gun in
your sweatpants? Oh!

947
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:59,308
Oh, the powers of observation
are unbelievable, sir.

948
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:01,310
I'm just saying, there's no
Gary Glitter shit going on.

949
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:03,562
There better not be
any Gary Glitter shit going on.

950
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,480
Oh. Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

951
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:07,858
What's Gary Glitter shit?

952
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:10,819
Gary Glitter was a glam rocker
in the '70s

953
00:42:10,904 --> 00:42:13,906
that got convicted of possessing
child pornography. Yeah.

954
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,908
Many, many magazines.
Many videos.

955
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:18,327
He ended up going to Vietnam
so he can diddle young boys.

956
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:20,329
Ended up in a Vietnam prison.

957
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:22,497
Then he got out of there,
went to Thailand,

958
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:24,166
got arrested there.

959
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,210
They put him in jail there.

960
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:28,378
He got released, and then he
was in Cambodia for a while.

961
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:30,464
Got booted outta that country.

962
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,799
Had to go back to the U K, but
they confiscated his computer.

963

♪ ♪ [humming "Rock and Roll (Part
Two)"] You know, at the arenas.

964
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:37,095
That's the fucking guy?
That's the guy.

965
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:42,643
She should have opened
a Pavilion,

966
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:45,145
even in a Town Square,
she would do.

967
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,605
Yeah.

968
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:48,106
Okay,
I've got to call you back.

969

Okay.

970
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:51,485
I love you, too.

971
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:54,238
I feel like...
I don't want to ask you this,

972
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:57,532
but can I borrow your car?

973
00:42:57,617 --> 00:42:59,743
I have to go find him.
I have to go figure out...

974
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,912
You want to borrow my beamer?

975
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:05,165
Yeah, if that's okay, just...
I just need it for...

976
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,709
to go up and just figure out what's
going on and to go see him...

977
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:08,961
Let's get you a drink.

978
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:10,420
I think you need a drink.

979
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:12,130
Okay, thank you.

980
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:14,091
You want something
with maraschino cherries?

981
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:15,884
Um...

982
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:18,971
I've been balling this girl
who works at Costco.

983
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:23,892
My dad was always
kind of crazy.

984
00:43:23,977 --> 00:43:26,395
You know, like kind of
a weird drug guy.

985
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:28,772
When my mom died,

986
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:31,108
he just went, like,
fucking nuts.

987
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:32,818
Really?

988
00:43:32,902 --> 00:43:35,737
I feel like baseball
is just my dad's thing.

989
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:37,614
Yeah. You know?

990
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:40,325
He just, like, tries
to force it on me.

991
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:41,910
Dads suck.

992
00:43:41,995 --> 00:43:43,912
Everybody would be
a lot better off

993
00:43:43,997 --> 00:43:45,872
if dads didn't exist.

994
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:47,874
I could deal with two moms.

995
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:50,961
Dude, I fucking
would love two moms.

996
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,380
Two moms would be a dream.

997
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,549
Sandwiches all the time.

998
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,719
Oh, there's no shortage
of sandwiches with my dad.

999
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:01,013
Really?
Yeah. He has this thing...

1000
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:04,391
like, sandwich diplomacy.
That's what I called it when I was younger.

1001
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,393
We'd get in a huge argument,

1002
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:09,062
and then, like, 30 minutes
later, he'd knock on my door

1003
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:11,273
and be like,
"Hey, you want a sandwich?"

1004
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:14,276
No, I don't want a fucking sandwich.
I think it's cute, actually.

1005
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,445
It's not cute.
I think it's cute.

1006
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:17,904
I'm pregnant.

1007
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:20,240
You're pregnant?

1008
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:23,076
I just found out.
With Fitz's baby?

1009
00:44:24,746 --> 00:44:26,913
In there? In your ass?

Hi, Cole? You know what I was thinking about?
Here. Take it.

1013
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,591
Get off the phone.
I was thinking about malls.

1014
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,926
Honestly, we need to use malls,

1015
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:42,137
because that is where people
congregate when they wanna buy.

1016

Tommy, I just told you
I'm pregnant.

at the Smithsonian.

with museums?

Yeah. Okay.

00:58:32,176 --> 00:58:35,178
He's going to Oakland
to see his dad. Dad.

1347
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,139
His own dad.

1348
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:40,224
His dad Arnie.

1349
00:58:40,309 --> 00:58:43,269
But Fitz said that he doesn't
have a relationship with him.

1350
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:45,771
Well, 'cause he's embarrassed, and
he didn't know he was gonna do,

1351
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:47,940
and I guess he does now.

1352
00:58:48,025 --> 00:58:50,902
Apparently his dad's sober and
trying to get his shit together.

1353
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:52,904
And he just didn't
fucking tell me about this.

1354
00:58:52,988 --> 00:58:55,531
Who the fuck am I living
with, Jason Bourne?

1355
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:03,623
Let me look at it. I'm gonna lift your sleeve.
It's probably gonna hurt.

1356
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:05,458
Keep your head up.
Keep your head up.

1357
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,210
All right?

1358
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:08,461
[groans]

1359
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,421
Ohh, gross! What? What?

1360
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:12,632
Is it okay? Gross! Yeah.

1361
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:14,634
Ohhhh! Fuck!

1362
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:16,886
Keep your arm straight.
All right?

1363
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:18,054
[grunts]

1364
00:59:18,138 --> 00:59:19,472
I'm kind of jealous.

1365
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,349
Why the fuck are you jealous?

1366
00:59:21,433 --> 00:59:23,935
Dude, that's rad! It's awesome!
That fucking hurt.

1367
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:27,188
[Sheila] Hon, can I come in?
Yeah, you can come in.

1368
00:59:29,733 --> 00:59:30,650
[door closes]

1369
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:32,193
Are you okay?

1370
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:35,780
Yeah.
[chuckles] I've been better.

1371
00:59:35,864 --> 00:59:38,741
Well, you know that Jason Bourne
isn't a real person, right?

1372
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:41,494
Yeah.

1373
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,037
They just made him up
for a movie.

1374
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:45,081
Yeah, I know.

1375
00:59:45,207 --> 00:59:47,416
I have something here for you.
Oh, yeah?

1376
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:49,418
Yeah. It's called Airborne. Oh.

1377
00:59:49,503 --> 00:59:52,672
It was invented by a teacher...
a teacher of children.

1378
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:55,883
I know when I'm feeling kind of
down, I like to make myself up one.

1379
00:59:55,968 --> 00:59:58,552
It makes me feel a lot better.

1380
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:01,097
Here you go. Oh, thank you.

1381
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:04,141
Just don't drink it until
it's finished fizzing. Okay.

1382
01:00:04,226 --> 01:00:06,185
I don't know.
Maybe I'm the crazy one.

1383
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:10,022
I just think that maybe lying
in a relationship

1384
01:00:10,107 --> 01:00:13,526
is not necessarily
the worst thing in the world.

1385
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,862
I mean, even people
that maybe you look up to

1386
01:00:16,947 --> 01:00:18,864
have lied before in the past.

1387
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:22,076
You know, like Richard Nixon,
for example.

1388
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,954
I mean, was there a better
President than Richard Nixon?

1389
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:26,956
I don't think so.

1390
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,125
And he is known
for being a liar.

1391
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:30,876
Think about it.

1392
01:00:30,961 --> 01:00:33,337
Didn't you kind of lie
right back to him

1393
01:00:33,422 --> 01:00:35,339
when you didn't tell him
that you were pregnant?

1394
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:38,092
Some people may consider that a lie.
I guess that's true.

1395
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:41,470
You're just a couple
of liars in love.

1396
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:44,932
Maybe that's what makes you
guys so perfect for each other.

1397
01:00:46,727 --> 01:00:51,272
Okay, so, Arnie,
Fitz's dad... Yeah?

1398
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:53,983
Like, when we were kids,
he used to play this game.

1399
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:56,193
It was called
milky-milky cakey-cake.

1400
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:58,237
It was awesome. What is that?

1401
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:01,073
Okay. He would take a sheet cake
and a gallon of milk. Okay.

1402
01:01:01,158 --> 01:01:03,075
Then he would eat out a hole,

1403
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,619
and then he'd fill it with
milk, and then he'd eat that.

1404
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:08,581
And they eat out another hole,
fill it with milk and eat that.

1405
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:10,624
And he would do it until...

1406
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:13,419
The game was over when all the
cake and the milk was gone.

1407
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:16,213
Milky-milky cakey-cake.
That's fucking awesome.

1408
01:01:16,298 --> 01:01:17,757
Yum. For kids? Yeah.

1409
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:19,759
I wanna play it
kind of, though,

1410
01:01:19,843 --> 01:01:21,260
even though I'm a grown-up.

1411
01:01:21,345 --> 01:01:24,096
Okay, so, um,

1412
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:27,224
Arnie's not the kind of guy
that's listed, right?

1413
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:29,685
Right.
So, I remember Fitz telling me

1414
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:32,188
that he does this thing...

1415
01:01:32,314 --> 01:01:34,231
Yeah?
...this performance thing,

1416
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:36,192
and I found it online.

1417
01:01:36,318 --> 01:01:39,904
He does a character called Eleanor.
Okay.

1418
01:01:39,988 --> 01:01:41,989
♪ ♪ [slow tempo] How fun.

1419
01:01:43,367 --> 01:01:45,326
He's creative.

1420
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:49,455
Okay, Rafael, just put your
arm through the sling.

1421
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:52,500
Try to keep it
as immobile as possible.

1422
01:01:52,584 --> 01:01:55,294
Can you explain to me how
you broke your hand again?

1423
01:01:55,379 --> 01:01:57,421
That's a pretty
serious fracture.

1424
01:01:57,506 --> 01:02:00,174
It's a compound fracture.
Batting practice.

1425
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:01,717
Rafael, you can answer.

1426
01:02:01,802 --> 01:02:03,928
Batting practice.

1427
01:02:04,012 --> 01:02:06,972
Batting pract...
That's a pretty serious injury.

1428
01:02:07,057 --> 01:02:10,434
It was pretty serious
batting practice.

1429
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:12,978
I'm gonna call your parents, see
if they can come pick you up.

1430
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:16,232
I wish that you could release him
to his parents, but they're dead.

1431
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:19,360
Train accident.

1432
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:22,113
Mmm.

1433
01:02:22,197 --> 01:02:23,823
Conductor was texting.

1434
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:26,784
Oh, yeah. I heard about that.
I'm very sorry.

1435
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:28,244
It was in the news.

1436
01:02:28,328 --> 01:02:29,745
May I ask who you are here?

1437
01:02:31,415 --> 01:02:34,291
Nice to meet you.
I'm Dr. Janis.

1438
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:36,710
Paul. Paul.
Very nice to meet you.

1439
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:38,254
Paul Furcal?

1440
01:02:38,338 --> 01:02:39,630
Yep.

1441
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:41,590
Okay.

1442
01:02:41,675 --> 01:02:44,260
Would you mind if I check your Id?
Just a precaution.

1443
01:02:44,344 --> 01:02:46,929
I left it in the dugout,

1444
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:49,181
'cause I was in such a rush
after he broke his...

1445
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:52,059
Great. I'm gonna go
check and see if I can

1446
01:02:52,144 --> 01:02:54,311
release him to you
without your I D.

1447
01:02:54,396 --> 01:02:57,273
So you guys...
What are you implying here?

1448
01:02:57,357 --> 01:02:59,483
You seem rather suspicious.

1449
01:02:59,568 --> 01:03:01,819
All right. Listen.
This is what I'm getting.

1450
01:03:01,903 --> 01:03:06,115
This is a very attractive
cute boy.

1451
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:09,702
Whoa. Who's the weirdo now?
Listen, I'm not weird.

1452
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:11,662
That was way weirder than...
That was way weirder.

1453
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:14,165
No. I've seen many
naked young boys.

1454
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:16,000
That's... Topped yourself again.
That's way weirder.

1455
01:03:16,084 --> 01:03:18,210
No, it's not weird.
It seems like

1456
01:03:18,295 --> 01:03:20,087
you might be molesting
this child.

1457
01:03:20,172 --> 01:03:22,256
You're the one
who called him pretty.

1458
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:25,551
I didn't say he was pretty.
I said he's an attractive young boy.

1459
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:27,136
Can we get another doctor?

1460
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:30,014
Listen, I'm not a...
That's not strange.

1461
01:03:30,098 --> 01:03:32,475
I've seen thousands
of young men naked.

1462
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:34,602
What? Because I'm a doctor.

1463
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:36,145
That's why.

1464
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:38,189
Maybe hundreds of thousands.

1465
01:03:38,273 --> 01:03:41,275
I've done charity work in Haiti.
Oh.

1466
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:44,862
It's terrible
what's going on down there.

1467
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:46,989
We're gonna have someone
from security coming in here.

1468
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:50,159
So you guys
just stay right here.

1469
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:51,577
Sure. We will.

1470
01:03:55,999 --> 01:03:58,000
Why is he calling you Rafael?

1471
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:00,044
I told him my name
is Rafael Furcal.

1472
01:04:00,128 --> 01:04:03,130
Who's that?
The shortstop for the Dodgers.

1473
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:06,050
That's your alias? Yeah.
It doesn't matter. He's a doctor.

1474
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:08,219
He doesn't watch baseball.
We gotta get the fuck outta here.

1475
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:09,637
Really? Doctors definitely
watch baseball.

1476
01:04:09,721 --> 01:04:11,096
Can you walk? Yeah.

1477
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:12,890
Can you run? Yeah.

1478
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:14,934
Run. Why are we always
fucking running?

1479
01:04:15,018 --> 01:04:17,102
[Fogerty] We got a little
text from Rico at the gym.

1480
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:19,104
Looks like
Mr. Fitzgerald's plates.

1481
01:04:19,189 --> 01:04:21,190
We've got a lead. Boo-yah.

1482
01:04:23,318 --> 01:04:24,985
My name is Pete Fogerty.

1483
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:27,071
I'm with
the LA Sheriff's Department.

1484
01:04:27,155 --> 01:04:30,157
My I D there. It says "Sheriff's
Department Gymnasium" on it.

1485
01:04:30,242 --> 01:04:31,784
It does not matter.
I went through the academy.

1486
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:33,953
I don't understand
what the problem is.

1487
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:36,247
If I give out a registered vehicle
to the non-registered owner,

1488
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:38,958
I could lose my license to tow.
So just forget it. Ain't gonna happen.

1489
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:41,961
We don't want the vehicle.
We just wanna look in the vehicle.

1490
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:45,506
Someone could lose their life or lose
their virginity. We don't know that.

1491
01:04:45,632 --> 01:04:47,883
We just wanna look at the vehicle.
A good chance that can happen.

1492
01:04:47,968 --> 01:04:49,301
All right. I'll tell you what.

1493
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:52,054
Why don't the two of you

1494
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:54,098
go back to your sheriff's gym,

1495
01:04:54,182 --> 01:04:57,476
work up a hot lather
pumping weights or whatever,

1496
01:04:57,561 --> 01:05:00,020
hit the showers
and fuck each other?

1497
01:05:00,105 --> 01:05:02,982
Give us the fucking keys to that
van, you piece of shit! Forget it!

1498
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:05,734
Everybody just calm down.
Look, you like to swim?

1499
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:08,320
Hey, put that down!
Put that down!

1500
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:12,241
I will tear
this fucking garage down!

1501
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:15,536
I will turn this shit-hole into a bigger shit-hole!
You're a fucking psycho!

1502
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:17,871
Give me the fucking keys
to the van, asshole!

1503
01:05:17,956 --> 01:05:19,415
Fine! Take it easy!

1504
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:22,001
Here.

1505
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:24,295
Should've given them to me
in the fucking first place!

1506
01:05:24,379 --> 01:05:27,464
We didn't have to go through this
shit, you dumb piece of shit!

1507
01:05:28,592 --> 01:05:30,259
[Jimmy] Ow! God!

1508
01:05:31,803 --> 01:05:33,846
Oakland. Let's go!

1509
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,557
[Jimmy] Dude, why did you just
break up with Monica like that?

1510
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:39,560
Because you don't make out with other
people when you live together.

1511
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:40,811
Amen to that.

1512
01:05:40,895 --> 01:05:42,313
This guy knows what's up.

1513
01:05:42,397 --> 01:05:44,607
Nasty.

1514
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:47,401
She just made out. She didn't fuck him.
She didn't have sex with him.

1515
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:49,862
As far as I know. So far.

1516
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:51,864
Doesn't matter.

1517
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:54,867
Once an animal
tastes another animal's blood,

1518
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:57,328
it always wants
the same blood again.

1519
01:05:57,412 --> 01:05:59,038
What does that...

1520
01:05:59,122 --> 01:06:00,831
It means now that
she's made out with Barry,

1521
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:02,833
she's always gonna want
to make out with Barry,

1522
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:04,877
'cause she knows what it's
like to make out with Barry.

1523
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:07,046
Whoever this Barry is, she
got that taste in her mouth,

1524
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:08,797
and she always
gonna crave Barry.

1525
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:13,927
I get it. He's just
looking out for his job,

1526
01:06:14,012 --> 01:06:16,680
but, you know,
he's being a real jerk.

1527
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:21,060
Ohh. Oh, boy.
This doesn't look good, James.

1528
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:23,062
Lots of signs
of struggle in here.

1529
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:25,064
Why do you say that?
I don't know.

1530
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:27,358
This could be claw marks here.

1531
01:06:27,442 --> 01:06:29,526
You know, escape attempts.

1532
01:06:29,611 --> 01:06:32,237
That could be anything.
Shut up and just see what you can find.

1533
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:34,198
I don't wanna hear
what you think.

1534
01:06:34,282 --> 01:06:36,617
I got a knapsack back here.
I think it's Jimmy's clothes.

1535
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:38,869
What? I got a notebook.

1536
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:40,704
Tor Eagle.

1537
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:43,082
Could be some neo-Nazi
sex trade group maybe, or...

1538
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:45,250
Why does there have to be sex
involved with everything?

1539
01:06:45,335 --> 01:06:48,045
It could be just a notebook.
There's a lot of sonnets in here.

1540
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:50,631
It bothers me that he doesn't have
his clothes with him right now.

1541
01:06:50,715 --> 01:06:53,092
That's my point.
This looks like a piss stain.

1542
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:54,760
He was scared, man.

1543
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:56,762
Whatever was going on,
he was scared.

1544
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:58,430
Is it a piss stain or not?

1545
01:06:58,515 --> 01:06:59,932
I don't have my DNA kit.

1546
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,767
Again, these are not
great things

1547
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:03,894
to find in a van where
no one can hear him scream.

1548
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:05,896
Whoa. Hey. Look at this.
What is this?

1549
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:10,025
Okay. [Beeping]

1550
01:07:10,110 --> 01:07:12,903
Berlin.
I'm looking for a Fitzgerald.

1551
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:14,947
My buddy Fitzgerald.
He's not here right now.

1552
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:17,700
Do you know if he's gonna
be coming in tonight, or...

1553
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:20,035
Yeah, about 8:00.
Thanks very much.

1554
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:21,870
We're going to Berlin.

like, a drag queen?

Glen, I'm so much more

01:09:53,398 --> 01:09:55,774
I host a Lady Gaga night

I'm a performer.

I own a radio-controlled

1590
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:02,364

I don't want

didn't work when I was a kid,

Jimmy's dad
is an abusive father,

1611
01:10:44,449 --> 01:10:46,408
and I'm taking Jimmy

1617

died, like, a year ago.

All right. Calm down.
It's not even that...

Fuck you, man!
Don't yell at him.

1623
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:12,684
Why did you come here?
You drove six hours.

1624
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:14,645
Why are you even here?

1625
01:11:14,729 --> 01:11:17,564
I'm pregnant.

Uhh...

1629
01:11:24,447 --> 01:11:27,366
And no one that I talked to thinks
that you're gonna be a good father.

1630
01:11:27,492 --> 01:11:30,535
Well, who have you talked to?
Tommy and Richie and my parents.

1631
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:33,830
Oh, great. So I'm the last person
to know that I have a fucking kid.

01:11:33,915 --> 01:11:37,709

a dad that's been trying to contact you.

1633
01:11:37,794 --> 01:11:39,544
I'm not even sure it's my kid.

that he knocked you up?

about being a dad.

That's gotta stop.
I'm gonna quit smoking weed.

1678
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:32,824
Really? Yeah.

1679
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:34,618
You're gonna take my advice?
Yeah.

1680
01:13:34,702 --> 01:13:36,703
I do want a cigarette, though.

1681
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:38,121
Hey, Carl. Yeah?

1682
01:13:38,206 --> 01:13:39,998
You got any smokes?

1683
01:13:40,083 --> 01:13:42,209
Yeah, I got a little goody box
behind the bar there.

1684
01:13:42,293 --> 01:13:44,127
Thanks, man.
Sorry I was rude before.

1685
01:13:44,212 --> 01:13:45,837
Hey, we're all in this
together, bro.

1686
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:55,013
Peace.

1687
01:13:55,098 --> 01:13:56,556
Hey, pothead! [Grunts]

1688
01:13:56,641 --> 01:13:58,225
God. Dad.

1689
01:13:58,351 --> 01:13:59,768
Dad, please... Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1690
01:13:59,894 --> 01:14:01,520
Dad...
What the hell happened to you?

1691
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:03,396
No. I swear to God,
he didn't even touch me.

1692
01:14:03,481 --> 01:14:05,440
What happened to your arm?
What did that pervert...

1693
01:14:05,525 --> 01:14:07,692
Shit! [Yelling]

1694
01:14:07,777 --> 01:14:09,611
Dad, please, stop.
Get off him, Dad.

1695
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:11,530
Go for the bridge!
Hit him in the bridge!

1696
01:14:11,614 --> 01:14:14,407
[all yelling]

1697
01:14:14,492 --> 01:14:17,244
Stand down, big guy! Come on!

1698
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:19,788
Back up. Back up now. Whoa.

1699
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:21,665
Everybody just stay back,
all right?

1700
01:14:21,749 --> 01:14:23,917
I am immortal!

1701
01:14:24,001 --> 01:14:25,961
[groans]

1702
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:28,463
Hey, stop, stop!
Cool it! Just stop, Dad!

1703
01:14:28,548 --> 01:14:30,465
Put it... Put it down.

1704
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:32,300
Shut up, you abusive asshole.

1705
01:14:32,385 --> 01:14:34,427
Abusive? I've never abused
anybody in my entire...

1706
01:14:34,512 --> 01:14:35,971
Bullshit!
You hit him all the time!

1707
01:14:36,055 --> 01:14:37,430
No. I do not hit him.

1708
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:39,432
He's not fucking abusive, okay?

1709
01:14:39,517 --> 01:14:41,893
He's just a dick.
He wants to send me to military school

1710
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:44,396
instead of just talking to me
about my problems.

1711
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,857
Okay, okay. Jimmy, calm down.

1712
01:14:46,941 --> 01:14:48,817
Dads are weird.

1713
01:14:48,901 --> 01:14:51,945
Like, look at my dad.
I haven't seen him in ten years.

1714
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:54,322
He thinks his sandwiches
are gonna fix everything.

1715
01:14:54,407 --> 01:14:56,324
The sandwiches
do fix everything.

1716
01:14:56,409 --> 01:14:58,243
Okay. Not now.

1717
01:14:59,871 --> 01:15:01,913
I know you guys
just miss your mom.

1718
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:07,210
And it's hard for dudes to
talk to each other, you know?

1719
01:15:07,295 --> 01:15:10,630
But you're just both gonna have
to find your third vertices.

1720
01:15:10,715 --> 01:15:12,632
Dad's suck,

1721
01:15:12,717 --> 01:15:14,968
but it's better
having a shitty one

1722
01:15:15,052 --> 01:15:17,512
than not having one,
believe me.

1723
01:15:17,597 --> 01:15:19,347
[sniffles]

1724
01:15:20,766 --> 01:15:22,893
Fuck.

1725
01:15:22,977 --> 01:15:25,270
That's a major breakthrough,
you guys.

1726
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:27,355
Thanks, Dirty Carl.

1727
01:15:31,736 --> 01:15:35,363
I'm sorry I misjudged you.
I'm sorry I knocked you out in the alley,

1728
01:15:35,448 --> 01:15:38,617
and then pushed you into the
mirror in the bathroom.

1729
01:15:38,701 --> 01:15:41,453
I'm sorry
I jacked you in the face

1730
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:43,330
with everything I had.

1731
01:15:43,414 --> 01:15:44,831
Okay...

1732
01:15:44,916 --> 01:15:46,666
You guys know
he's a brother Mason?

1733
01:15:46,751 --> 01:15:48,084
[chuckles]

1734
01:15:48,169 --> 01:15:50,086
And I'm gonna get a dog.

1735
01:15:54,884 --> 01:15:56,551
All right.
We're gonna hit it. Yeah.

1736
01:15:56,636 --> 01:15:58,303
Stop by the house,
though, all right?

1737
01:15:58,429 --> 01:15:59,888
We'll have a cookout or something.
For sure.

1738
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:02,390
Hey, you ready? Yeah. Let's go.

1739
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:03,892
Cairo. Abiff.

1740
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:06,645
I'll see you out there.
Yeah. Uh...

1741
01:16:06,771 --> 01:16:09,397
We're both kind of fucked up.
Yeah.

1742
01:16:09,482 --> 01:16:11,233
Everybody is, I think. Yeah.

1743
01:16:13,069 --> 01:16:14,945
You... Um...

1744
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:17,447
I'll stop by the garage or
something, yeah? Sure, man.

1745
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:20,075
See you soon? Yeah.

1746
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:22,202
Fuck. Come here.

1747
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:25,664
Take care of yourself.
Later, bud.

1748
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:29,167
Arnie, good to meet you.
Yeah. I'm gonna...

1749
01:16:29,252 --> 01:16:31,086
See ya.

1750
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:34,005
Son, with these sandwiches,

1751
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:37,175
I officially make amends
to you.

1752
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:39,719
I know I've been
a deadbeat dad,

1753
01:16:39,804 --> 01:16:41,680
but as a grandpa,

1754
01:16:41,764 --> 01:16:43,890
I'm gonna be live-beat.

1755
01:16:43,975 --> 01:16:45,767
I like that.

1756
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:47,686
You're really weird,

1757
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:50,105
but I love you a lot.

1758
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:51,856
Come on.

1759
01:16:55,319 --> 01:16:57,237
You even hug weird.

1760
01:16:57,321 --> 01:17:00,031
Come on. You've gotta
go after Monica.

1761
01:17:00,116 --> 01:17:01,825
She's such a lovely girl.

1762
01:17:01,909 --> 01:17:03,702
She reminds me
a lot of your mom.

1763
01:17:03,786 --> 01:17:06,037
Now go get her.

1764
01:17:06,163 --> 01:17:09,332
Do you want your apartment key?
No, no. That's okay.

1765
01:17:09,417 --> 01:17:10,500
Okay.

1766
01:17:10,584 --> 01:17:11,876
Don't worry about it.

1767
01:17:20,344 --> 01:17:22,721
[Arnie's voice]
Dear Glen, you're an angel.

1768
01:17:22,805 --> 01:17:24,806
Arnie. Dad.

1769
01:17:35,526 --> 01:17:37,444
[Barry] I wanna give you
guys some good news.

1770
01:17:37,528 --> 01:17:41,614
The good news is that
Monica here... okay...

1771
01:17:41,699 --> 01:17:44,284
through her hard work,
grit, and determination,

1772
01:17:44,368 --> 01:17:47,245
has been promoted
to segment producer.

1773
01:17:47,371 --> 01:17:49,664
So let that be an example to you guys.
Oh, wow.

1774
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:51,958
Thank you.
Hard work, grit, and determination,

1775
01:17:52,043 --> 01:17:53,668
all right here.

1776
01:17:53,753 --> 01:17:56,629
I hope that makes you
very happy.

1777
01:17:58,424 --> 01:18:00,342
So it's just, like...
I feel great, Barry.

1778
01:18:00,426 --> 01:18:02,177
Thank you. Yeah.
Good. Good. All right.

1779
01:18:02,261 --> 01:18:03,970
You should.

1780
01:18:04,055 --> 01:18:06,973
Summer fires. This is gonna
be our sweeps story.

1781
01:18:07,058 --> 01:18:10,977
We need chopper footage
of forest fires.

1782
01:18:11,062 --> 01:18:13,146
I'm not saying start a fire,
but I'm not saying...

1783
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:16,191
Okay. I'm ready to be a dad.

1784
01:18:16,275 --> 01:18:17,692
Okay. Whoa.

1785
01:18:17,777 --> 01:18:19,277
This is a closed meeting.

1786
01:18:19,362 --> 01:18:20,487
Shut up, Barry.

1787
01:18:20,571 --> 01:18:22,864
Uh, you shut up.

1788
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:24,616
Not now, Barry? Oh, not now?

1789
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,659
Yeah, not now.
How about not right now?

1790
01:18:26,786 --> 01:18:28,953
How about not right now, Bar?
How about not now?

1791
01:18:29,038 --> 01:18:30,330
Not now, Barry. Get out.

1792
01:18:30,456 --> 01:18:32,248
Not now. You get out. Get...

1793
01:18:32,333 --> 01:18:34,167
I see that you're still upset.

1794
01:18:34,251 --> 01:18:35,794
Understandable.

1795
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:38,004
I've been kind of an asshole.

1796
01:18:38,089 --> 01:18:41,508
I left you alone
when you needed me.

1797
01:18:41,592 --> 01:18:43,676
But, honestly,
kidnapping that kid

1798
01:18:43,761 --> 01:18:46,388
was, like, the best thing
that I've ever done.

1799
01:18:46,472 --> 01:18:48,556
Let's go.
I realize that I've been

1800
01:18:48,641 --> 01:18:50,892
a fucking asshole recently.

1801
01:18:50,976 --> 01:18:53,728
I've been lying to you.
I've been selling drugs.

1802
01:18:53,813 --> 01:18:55,522
I'm a loser.

1803
01:18:55,606 --> 01:18:58,149
I wanna be in
my kid's life, though.

1804
01:18:58,234 --> 01:19:00,151
I'm a loser
'cause I didn't have a dad,

1805
01:19:00,236 --> 01:19:02,695
and I don't want my kid
to be anything like me.

1806
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:05,323
I never, ever want
to make him sandwiches.

1807
01:19:05,408 --> 01:19:07,200
That doesn't make sense.
[chuckling]

1808
01:19:07,284 --> 01:19:09,202
Parents make sandwiches
for their kids all the time.

1809
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:11,413
Dude, I've been in, like,
three fights this weekend.

1810
01:19:11,539 --> 01:19:12,789
Yeah?
I'm getting pretty good at it.

1811
01:19:12,873 --> 01:19:14,124
Wanna make it four? Yeah!

1812
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:15,959
Do you? Fine! Catch me then!

1813
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:19,629
I haven't even smoked weed
in two days,

1814
01:19:19,713 --> 01:19:22,590
and I can go a couple more
without any problem.

1815
01:19:22,675 --> 01:19:25,844
So, two days at a time
eventually.

1816
01:19:25,928 --> 01:19:30,557
150 of those. That's, like, a year, babe.
Come on, man.

1817
01:19:30,641 --> 01:19:33,518
I'm gonna be there all the time for him.
I bought that car seat.

1818
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:36,771
If you don't like it, we can go back
to the thrift store and get a new one.

1819
01:19:36,897 --> 01:19:39,274
They have, like, five different ones.
Get out!

1820
01:19:39,358 --> 01:19:40,817
How about I call your wife

1821
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:42,735
and tell her that you
were making out

1822
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:45,530
with my sad, pregnant
girlfriend, you fucking dick?

1823
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:47,532
That would be weird.

1824
01:19:48,909 --> 01:19:51,536
I wanna be in my kid's life.

1825
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:55,248
I wanna be in your life
as much as you'll let me.

1826
01:19:55,332 --> 01:19:57,959
And I'm gonna love you forever.

1827
01:20:00,129 --> 01:20:02,422
Yeah. I get that
you love me, Fitz.

1828
01:20:02,506 --> 01:20:04,174
I can't count on you, though.

1829
01:20:10,306 --> 01:20:12,265
Whatever. [Laughing]

1830
01:20:12,349 --> 01:20:14,642
Later, loser!

1831
01:20:14,727 --> 01:20:17,395
[chuckling]

1832
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:19,564
Nothing like
a little comic relief.

1833
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:23,818
Um, go to your worksheets
for a second.

1834
01:20:26,113 --> 01:20:28,865
Listen, don't let

1835
01:20:28,991 --> 01:20:32,118
that loser get... Ugh!
Okay. You know what?

1836
01:20:32,203 --> 01:20:34,996
You are so disgusting.
You can keep your promotion.

1837
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:36,581
Okay?

1838
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:38,917
Keep it. I don't need it.

1839
01:20:41,795 --> 01:20:43,296
Fitz!

1840
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:45,423
"I don't need
to be segment producer."

1841
01:20:45,508 --> 01:20:47,509
[snickers]

1842
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:52,388
Fitz! Fitz, wait up!

1843
01:20:52,473 --> 01:20:53,681
Fitz.

1844
01:20:53,766 --> 01:20:55,517
What are you doing here?

1845
01:21:02,191 --> 01:21:04,943
So you like the car seat.

1846
01:21:05,027 --> 01:21:05,944
