00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,656
- Okay, Sam.
- Good luck.

3
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,336
You look like shit.

4
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,088
You look worse.

5
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:17,924
Yeah.

6
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,097
So I kind of missed you.

7
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:26,974
I missed you, too.

8
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:33,564
Did that just get weird?

9
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,232
Yes. Maybe a little.

10
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,861
Here, can I take your bags?

11
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:40,363
I can handle it.

12
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,489
You remember this.

13
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,574
Oh, my favorite car.

14
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,887
So,

15
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,764
this is me.

16
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,225
You're kidding.

17
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:10,977
Hey, this couch folds out.

18
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:12,706
Or you could sleep in the window seat.

19
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:17,650
This is the worst apartment I've ever seen.

20
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:20,319
Hey! It's not much, but it's mine.

21
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:22,571
There's cable TV, everything.

22
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,659
This is for me?

23
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,371
No, it's for my other friend
who just got out of prison.

24
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:31,747
Yeah.

25
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:37,294
Oh, the Three Musketeers.

26
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,172
Hey, look at Hirschey.

27
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,467
Looks like a baby.

28
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,971
Those were the days, my friend.

29
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,055
Yeah.

30
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,933
Your place looks

31
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,436
like where I just came from.

32
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:55,271
Except it's worse.

33
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,772
It's not to your liking?

34
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:58,941
- Sorry.
- "Not to my liking"

35
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,153
is the understatement of all time.

36
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:03,904
There's cable TV.

37
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,614
Yeah, I know.
You said that already.

38
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:08,993
I got Starz and Showtime,

39
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,120
and I was in fucking lockdown.

40
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,913
I need to wash up.

41
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,542
Can I use the commode
for, like, two seconds?

42
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,461
- Sure.
- Thank you.

43
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:21,130
I hope the commode is to your liking.

44
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:39,732
Hey, brother.

45
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,735
Can we skedaddle out of here,

46
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,278
do you think?

47
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,656
Is Mama Zeech's still open?

48
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,076
Yeah.

49
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:52,244
Good.

50
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,163
I've been dreaming about her coffee.

51
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,249
Yeah. I could use a cup right now.

52
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:00,836
We can do whatever you want, Val.

53
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:03,089
It's your day.

54
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,507
Yeah, let's do it.

55
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,263
Yeah.

56
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,202
You feel like partying?

57
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,578
Because I could fucking party right now.

58
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,914
No. I don't feel like partying.

59
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:40,793
So what, then?

60
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,587
I don't know what to tell you, Val.
I do the same thing.

61
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:45,798
Every day, I paint the sunrise,

62
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,675
watch the cable TV,

63
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,219
try to eat right, relax, go to bed.

64
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,721
Nothing earth-shattering.

65
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:56,725
How's your daughter?
How's Jessica?

66
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,062
She doesn't want me to find her.

67
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,480
And?

68
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:03,315
I did anyway. She's working.

69
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:04,733
Minneapolis.

70
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,528
Yeah? Didn't she have a kid?

71
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:08,821
Your granddaughter.

72
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,030
She did. Does.

73
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,032
What is she up to?

74
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,077
I couldn't find her.

75
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,291
I kept in touch with some people.

76
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:22,918
What people?

77
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,212
What people do you think?

78
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,339
Friends.

79
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:29,550
High and low places.

80
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:33,387
Friends who would be amenable

81
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,930
to us having our comeback.

82
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:36,682
I'm retired.

83
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:37,892
You retired.

84
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,436
I'm serious.

85
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,106
Another subject.

86
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,443
I could really fucking party.

87
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,236
You know what I'm saying.

88
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,613
Should we go to Miss D's?

89
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,449
Miss D's

90
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,159
still exists?

91
00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:58,495
It's Doc. I called.

92
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,374
- Yeah.
- This is Val.

93
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,542
- Yeah, yeah.
- Hey.

94
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:04,793
Come in. Come in.

95
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:05,961
It looks the same.

96
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,967
Is Miss DeHaviland around anywhere?

97
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,303
Yeah. I'm Miss DeHaviland.

98
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,280
He's talking about your mother, I think.

99
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:17,348
Oh, she couldn't take the cold,

100
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,600
so she set up shop in Florida.

101
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:20,809
Boca.

102
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:22,436
- You look like her.
- Yeah?

103
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:24,855
Anyway, my friend is looking for a party.

104
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:27,274
Yeah?

105
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,485
What kind of party?

106
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,655
- Bar mitzvah.
- Oh.

107
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,241
A coming-out party.
A going-in party.

108
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,201
Yeah, I got the next best thing.

109
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:38,911
Oxana!

110
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,956
Now, look at this.

111
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,503
I think that's the party
I'm talking about. Yeah.

112
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,547
She's from Minsk.

113
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,341
Very clean.

114
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:55,469
Oh, yeah.

115
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,429
Clean is good.

116
00:09:58,682 --> 00:09:59,765
Happy parole.

117
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,100
Follow me.

118
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,228
Enjoy.

119
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:06,605
Right.

120
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,148
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

121
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,025
- Relax. Relax.
- Yeah.

122
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,197
You fixed the place up.

123
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:16,442
It's the same, but different.

124
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,491
Huh.

125
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,128
Would you give my regards
to your mother, please?

126
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,378
We used to be close.

127
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:30,796
Old friends.

128
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,843
I hope she still remembers me.

129
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:38,345
- So do I.

130
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,063
- She's a beauty.
- Hello.

131
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:49,606
Oh. Yeah. Yeah.

132
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:52,192
Nice, too. Sweet girl.

133
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,737
Aren't you? She is.

134
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,739
Come on.
Do you want to have fun?

135
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:57,906
I'm retired.

136
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:58,991
We'll have fun.

137
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,076
- Trust me, case closed.
- Come on.

138
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,953
Wendy, I need to use the phone.

139
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:04,163
- Is that okay?

140
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:06,123
Yeah. There's one through there.

141
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,166
Thank you.

142
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:10,294
That was quick.

143
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,378
Yeah. It didn't work.

144
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,389
- Is something wrong?
- That's not good.

145
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,423
No. "Not good"?

146
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,468
- It's okay. It's okay.
- We'll be back.

147
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:18,677
What are you smiling at?

148
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:20,721
- Do you find it funny? Is this funny?
- No!

149
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:23,599
Do you have anything
that could help my friend out?

150
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:25,893
Boner pills?

151
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,270
Yeah, we ran out of boner pills.

152
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:29,855
Is this a first for you?

153
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,339
- It's okay.
- We'll come back.

154
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,608
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

155
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:34,485
Just keep smiling.

156
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:36,528
We'll be back.
I'll settle up with you.

157
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,239
Guys, if you get back before 7:00,

158
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,200
I'll give you the early bird special.

159
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,459
Now, I thought you said you retired.

160
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:51,794
I have.

161
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,296
But some tools

162
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,131
you hate to give up.

163
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,717
Yeah. I could have
done that with my dick.

164
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,678
Right, that's why we're here.

165
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:03,680
Oh! That was just plain cruel.

166
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:04,890
I'm sorry.

167
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:10,938
Do you remember that time you threw that
Greek out of the hotel window?

168
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:12,815
I do.

169
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,067
He fell straight onto a street-meat vendor.

170
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,444
I felt bad about that part.

171
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,829
Oh, this is definitely
a violation of my parole.

172
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:30,666
It's okay. I need to fill
my Nexium prescription anyway.

173
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:32,543
What's Nexium?

174
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:33,669
It's for my ulcer.

175
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,546
So what are we looking for?

176
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,548
Ah. This.

177
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,299
What is that?

178
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:41,009
- Hmm?
- Oh.

179
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,932
You're only supposed to take one.

180
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,935
I want to make sure.

181
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,692
So are we done here?

182
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,194
No, I need some perindopril.

183
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,738
What?

184
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,198
And some...

185
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,160
Ooh! Latanoprost.

186
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:09,079
My co-pay is insane
on this one.

187
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,081
And...

188
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:14,001
Ooh, Aldactone
for hypertension.

189
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:15,878
Huh?

190
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:18,046
How much shit are you on?

191
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:19,548
A lot.

192
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,513
So how long does this take

193
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,015
to get the pipes working?

194
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,558
I wouldn't know.

195
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,936
What are we going to do
while we wait?

196
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:39,234
Three Andrew Jacksons
say I run this table.

197
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,153
But you don't have any money.

198
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,239
What does that mean?
You spot me.

199
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:47,659
But that would be
robbing Peter to pay Paul.

200
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,745
"Each one must give

201
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,497
as he has decided in his heart,

202
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:54,082
not reluctantly or under compulsion."

203
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,543
Yeah. Corinthians.

204
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,504
Chapter nine, verse seven.

205
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,172
I love Corinthians.

206
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:03,091
Okay. Let's do the five.

207
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,219
Oh, it's all mine...

208
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:07,387
Oh, wait, let me
get out of your way.

209
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,473
You can stay in my way.
I don't care.

210
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,976
- Oh!
- See?

211
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:14,937
Keep it.

212
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,939
- Thank you.
- It's yours.

213
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,982
You gave me a nice thing here.

214
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,652
- It's too easy, but I'm going to take it.
- Well, it is easy.

215
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:22,945
- Oh!

216
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,240
That was not fair.

217
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:27,533
No, it wasn't.

218
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,118
Uh-oh.

219
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:32,538
What?

220
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:39,419
Mount Everest just
moved into my pants.

221
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,300
So all systems go?

222
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,135
Oh, yeah.

223
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,054
I'm so fucking hard,

224
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,640
I could cut a diamond.

225
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,475
You shouldn't have taken so many.

226
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,060
Oh, fuck that.

227
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,148
My old friend.

228
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,902
Are you ready, Val?

229
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:05,737
Ooh! Wow.

230
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,323
You don't know.

231
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,117
I've never been more ready.

232
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,119
Let's go.

233
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:13,537
Oh, yes.

234
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,373
Come on.

235
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,919
The next smile you see
will be on Oxana's face.

236
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,006
That's my only son.

237
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,717
- Aw.
- I'm going to use the phone, okay?

238
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,771
Paul, where's my fucking
Kung Pao Chicken?

239
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,232
It's on its way.
You got a call.

240
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,776
Fuck my ass,
and give me the phone.

241
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:51,742
Claphands here.

242
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,578
It's Doc.

243
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,707
Will the package be
delivered on time?

244
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,252
I can't do what I said I would do.

245
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:03,712
Well, then if you

246
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:06,256
can't deliver the package,

247
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,719
then you won't be a friend
of mine any longer.

248
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:15,515
Do I need to become
more explicit here?

249
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,727
- No.
- No.

250
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,439
I didn't think so.

251
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,317
How long do I have?

252
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,152
What do you mean,
how long do you have?

253
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,695
To deliver the package.

254
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:30,530
How long do I have?

255
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,074
I don't fucking believe this shit.

256
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:35,535
Do I have dementia? Paul, who's the
President of the United States?

257
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,412
- Um...
- Shut the fuck up!

258
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,248
You have until morning.

259
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,251
What, like, 10:00?

260
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:44,753
Or later, like brunch time?

261
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,008
This is like talking
to Conchita, my maid.

262
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,762
Kill him by 10:00 in the a.m.,

263
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,764
or you're dead, too.

264
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,433
The motherfucker shoots my only son!

265
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:02,437
The only reason I've let you live

266
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,189
was for this.

267
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,108
Are we clear?

268
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,735
We're clear.

269
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,696
Then, good night.

270
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,670
Wendy, Wendy.

271
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,049
Doc, is everything all right?

272
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,969
No, but thank you for asking.

273
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:37,931
I bet you're the type of man
who wouldn't let a lady

274
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,975
drink by herself. Huh?

275
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:43,311
Of course not.

276
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,233
Just a taste.

277
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,737
This is good stuff.

278
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,414
Doc, my mother always told me

279
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,249
to do the best with what you have,

280
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:05,917
where you are.

281
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:09,142
- Your mother was something.

282
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,092
So,

283
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,470
did everything work
this time, Valentine?

284
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,014
Four times. It worked.

285
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,684
I could have gone again,
but she's all worn out.

286
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,102
Good for you.

287
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:26,021
Come on,
let's blow this pop stand.

288
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:28,899
Wendy, for everything,
thank you.

289
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,276
I hope you find peace, Doc.

290
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,488
Me, too.

291
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,698
I feel so ready to party!

292
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:39,701
Bye, Smiley.

293
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,086
Those girls look like
they want to party.

294
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,632
Why embarrass yourself?

295
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:56,718
Embarrass myself?

296
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,415
I'm doing the
Battle of the Bulge.

297
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,471
This goes up and down

298
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:00,722
like a fucking yo-yo.

299
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:01,973
Pray for me.

300
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:10,273
Hey, ladies.

301
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:12,555
What do you say,
what do you know?

302
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:16,363
It's me, Giacomo.

303
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,576
Shouldn't you be in bed?

304
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,203
In bed?

305
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,580
Baby,

306
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:29,084
I have got a python in my pants

307
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,087
harder than
the Rock of Gibraltar.

308
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,344
Don't talk to me.

309
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,846
- Can we go home now?
- Oh, no.

310
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:42,430
Definitely not now.

311
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:44,641
We don't go home.

312
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:46,601
We're just getting started, buddy.

313
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:49,271
I need 20 bucks.
I'll be right back.

314
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:50,438
What are you doing, Val?

315
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:52,148
Give it to me.
I'm not asking.

316
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,360
Yeah!

317
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:58,488
Hey, hey, can you
help a brother out?

318
00:19:58,865 --> 00:19:59,865
What's happening?

319
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:02,075
I want you to play something
a little different.

320
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,245
You know, like when
music was still music,

321
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:06,830
when it had a little soul.

322
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,206
You're talking old school.

323
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:09,749
Old school, yeah.

324
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,607
Right, yeah. There's not much
call for old school around here.

325
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:15,088
Yeah, tonight
might be different. Okay?

326
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,174
I think it could be.

327
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:19,634
I can trust you, right?
Slow.

328
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:20,719
You can trust me.

329
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:22,345
Don't let me down.

330
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,474
Hey, I'm back.

331
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,895
First of all,
I just want to say,

332
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:32,063
- it was rude, what I did.
- Yes.

333
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:34,649
And I deserve
everything you gave me.

334
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,653
I apologize.
Do you forgive me?

335
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,075
Anyway, do you like to dance?

336
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:48,038
- Mmm-hmm.
- Lisa...

337
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:50,165
Listen, Lisa...

338
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,875
I'm Valentine.

339
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,294
My friends call me Val.

340
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,004
Now here's the situation.

341
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,923
I've been away for a long time.

342
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:00,133
Where, I can't say,

343
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,886
but I really need you
to dance with me.

344
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:06,473
Now, I'm not going
to ask you to go home with me.

345
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,350
I'm not going to try to kiss you,

346
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:09,851
or feel your ass, or anything.

347
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:12,187
I just want to dance.

348
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:14,105
One song.

349
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:16,775
That's all I'm proposing.

350
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:19,653
Two people, holding each other,

351
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:21,947
swaying in time.

352
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:23,698
Nothing else.

353
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,367
After that,

354
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:27,619
you'll never see me

355
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,872
or hear from me again.

356
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,500
I promise.

357
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,502
How does that sound
to you, Lisa?

358
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,921
What do you think?

359
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,049
- All right, Val.
- Oh, that's good.

360
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:21,232
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

361
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:23,485
What can I say?

362
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:29,449
Let me see this.

363
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,576
Cataracts.

364
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,827
Yeah?

365
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:35,622
If I blow them,
maybe they give me a buzz.

366
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,042
Ah.

367
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,755
Hey, buddy.

368
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:56,226
Oh, goddamn!
What else you got?

369
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:58,645
I'll try it.

370
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,815
I got some for hypertension.

371
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:06,861
What are they?
They're green.

372
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,864
Okay. Here you go.

373
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,409
You never know what can

374
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:14,994
- come out of this shit.
- Nice.

375
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:16,621
Hey, hey, hey!
Listen, no drugs at the bar.

376
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:17,747
If you want to do drugs,
have the courtesy

377
00:24:17,832 --> 00:24:18,790
to take it to the bathroom.

378
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,154
No, no, no,
this is prescription.

379
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:21,793
I got the hypertension.

380
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,880
You find that funny?
I don't.

381
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:27,715
No. Listen, what else
can I get you guys?

382
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:30,051
Yeah, we want
a couple of drinks to go.

383
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,553
- To go?
- Yes.

384
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,263
- That's illegal.

385
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:34,973
And this isn't?

386
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:39,144
Here, let's make it legal.

387
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:41,187
You got it.

388
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:46,860
Ah!

389
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:50,113
What's this?

390
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,824
Oh, I'm just trying to
see what time it is.

391
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:55,451
Do you know what time it is?

392
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:01,207
Do you want to move back
a little, sonny boy?

393
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,545
It says so right there.

394
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:07,672
Yeah. It's getting kind of late,

395
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,340
isn't it?

396
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:10,758
Hmm.

397
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:13,511
Come on, let's go.

398
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:15,930
What was that?

399
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,977
- Stupid jerk.
- Strange.

400
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:28,151
All our friends,

401
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:30,612
all our business associates,

402
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:34,407
out of sight, out of mind.

403
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:36,618
You're the only one

404
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,369
who kept in touch.

405
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:39,954
I know, Val.

406
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,664
Let me talk for
two fucking seconds.

407
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,711
You sent me

408
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:49,380
those care packages.

409
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,551
And those paintings...

410
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,973
- I never told you how beautiful they were.
- Thank you.

411
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:00,975
Can I talk for
two fucking seconds?

412
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:04,312
I'm serious.

413
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,231
I never told you.

414
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:10,193
I would stare at those paintings.

415
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:17,075
I could feel the sun rising.

416
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,453
I could feel it.

417
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:23,164
Thank you, Val.

418
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,419
You're my only friend.

419
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:32,090
And you are mine.

420
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,219
Sit in the car.
Come on.

421
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:40,265
Am I?

422
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:44,435
I'm still hard.
Is that a problem?

423
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,104
It is, actually.

424
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:48,731
I feel kind of light-headed.

425
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:50,066
That's all right.

426
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:51,818
Just get your leg in there.

427
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:52,944
Oh, shit.

428
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,029
That's all right.
Mmm-hmm.

429
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,129
Uh-oh.

430
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:12,880
"Uh-oh," what?

431
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,052
- I think I'm going to pass out.

432
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:34,295
Wake up.

433
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,466
- I'm up. I'm up, I'm up.
- Val, wake up.

434
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:40,635
You okay?

435
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:42,970
I don't think so.

436
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,192
Am I going to die?

437
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:57,777
Not tonight.

438
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:01,989
It's okay, you know?
You can tell me.

439
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:03,991
Tell me straight, all right?

440
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:06,327
Not on my watch.

441
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:09,205
Okay. Doc, are you there?

442
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:10,498
Yeah.

443
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,811
I just want to know
if something's going to happen, that's all.

444
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:15,253
I just...

445
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:17,422
I like to know
what's going to happen.

446
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:19,465
I like information.
Okay?

447
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,842
- Oh, boy...

448
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,474
Hirsch? What's that?

449
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:30,893
It's Hirsch's daughter.

450
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:35,314
You're Hirsch's daughter?
Are you kidding me?

451
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:38,609
- You got so big.

452
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:40,390
I knew you when you were little.

453
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:42,071
Yeah? Time flies, right?

454
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:43,698
I'm fucking dying.

455
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,700
- I'm dying.
- What?

456
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,827
I'm fucking dying.

457
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,913
- I'm so dizzy.
- Rest.

458
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,331
Oh.

459
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:53,416
Take a deep breath.

460
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:57,128
Relax, he's not dying.

461
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,292
The doctor's going
to be here in a couple of minutes.

462
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:02,884
How is your father?

463
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:05,094
His emphysema's pretty bad.

464
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,972
He's over at The Lighthouse
nursing home these days,

465
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,265
ever since Mom died.

466
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,059
- He's hanging in.
- For your 10th birthday,

467
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:13,644
we were there.

468
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:17,732
I threw you up in the air.

469
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:21,444
That was you?

470
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,863
I threw you up in the air,

471
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,239
and I caught you.

472
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:27,658
Do you remember that?

473
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:32,997
I felt like I was flying.

474
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,582
I remember you catching me.

475
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:36,292
You remember that?

476
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:41,631
Oh! Oh, oh, have mercy.

477
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,258
You were in jail, right?

478
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,887
Yeah. So what?

479
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:49,555
What did you do?

480
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,058
I'm supposed to
answer that? Fuck.

481
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:55,228
I got, like, no blood
in my brain anymore.

482
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,063
He had some bad luck is all.

483
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:59,899
Oh. Yeah, well,
I know all about that.

484
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,359
Excuse me.

485
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:02,443
Yeah.

486
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,112
I'll take a quick look.

487
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:06,447
Mmm-hmm.

488
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:12,912
How many pills did he take?

489
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,121
A fistful.

490
00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:17,083
- I see.
- Are you a real doctor?

491
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:20,169
Are you a real patient?
Is that a real penis?

492
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:23,673
Mr. Valentine, you have
what is called vein-induced priapism.

493
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:26,527
Now, I can give you
some blood thinners to open things up a bit,

494
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:28,511
but the old blood's
got to be removed

495
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:29,995
in order for
fresh blood to flow in.

496
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,556
Removed?
In what way, removed?

497
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:33,349
What's he talking about?

498
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:34,475
Oh!

499
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,353
Oh! Fuck me.

500
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:39,480
Okay, let's relax.

501
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,857
What is this?
Where are you going, Doc?

502
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:43,651
- Where you going?
- I'm out of here.

503
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:44,944
Oh, no, what are you doing?

504
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,070
I'll be... I'll be
in the waiting room.

505
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,194
Look at me. Breathe.

506
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:50,533
Maybe I partied a little too hard.

507
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,118
Maybe a little.

508
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:55,621
I don't have, uh,

509
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:56,831
health insurance.

510
00:31:57,291 --> 00:31:58,374
I paid the bill.

511
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:00,001
Okay.

512
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,006
So who's going to do it?

513
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,090
Do what?

514
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,174
You know what.

515
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:08,759
I don't.

516
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,595
Let's just drop

517
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,471
the welcome-home thing, okay?

518
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,015
I know.

519
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:15,975
Hey, there, Doc.

520
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:17,351
Hey, Alex.

521
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:18,603
Who's your friend?

522
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:20,771
This is my best friend.

523
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:23,441
Valentine, Alex.

524
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:25,568
He just got back from a long trip.

525
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:28,066
- Well, how was your trip, Valentine?
- Oh, it was...

526
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:29,947
I'm just glad I'm back.

527
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:32,033
And I don't answer
to the name Valentine.

528
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:34,368
My friends call me Val.

529
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,496
Okay, well, then
I'll call you Val, Val.

530
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,999
Well, then we're friends.

531
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,043
Yeah, you can never
have enough.

532
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:43,961
Yeah, you're right there.

533
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,297
Doc and I, we've
been friends for a while now. Haven't we?

534
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:47,381
We have.

535
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:49,511
I remember
the very first time he walked in here.

536
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:50,551
You remember that?

537
00:32:51,053 --> 00:32:52,094
Sure, I do.

538
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:55,306
I hate to break up
this remembering of more wistful times,

539
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,267
- but I'm a little on the peckish side.
- Sure.

540
00:32:59,061 --> 00:33:00,561
What will it be tonight, fellows?

541
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:02,355
Uh, tea and lemon, please.

542
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:03,481
Okay.

543
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,024
I'll have the surf and turf,

544
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,693
and a root beer float.

545
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,700
All right, how do you
like your steak done, Val?

546
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,531
- Bloody.

547
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,576
Coming right up.

548
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,163
How are you doing, Tony?

549
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:20,414
Can I have a little more?

550
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,792
Is she always so sweet?

551
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:24,960
Every day I walk out of here,

552
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:26,962
I'm always better.

553
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:28,422
Yeah.

554
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:31,592
So who's gonna do it?

555
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,928
I don't know.

556
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:35,221
It's you, isn't it?

557
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:36,305
I don't know.

558
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:38,057
It's you. Come on,
just say it.

559
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,350
It's you.

560
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,060
What do you think this is here?

561
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:43,224
I'm not gonna blame you for anything.
A job is a job.

562
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:46,482
If the roles were reversed,
I'd do it in a heartbeat.

563
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:49,151
Come on, man.
Say it's you!

564
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,611
It's me.

565
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,620
Claphands.

566
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,790
He's got a mean streak
in him. No?

567
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,418
A bit of an understatement.

568
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:07,336
Yeah.

569
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:11,048
The meanest, most
vindictive motherfucker

570
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:14,802
outside the devil himself.

571
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:22,435
The first couple of years
I was inside,

572
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:26,230
I had my head on a swivel,
you know?

573
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,314
I was lookin' here,
lookin' there.

574
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:30,234
"What the fuck is gonna happen
and when is it gonna happen?"

575
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:32,778
"Is it gonna happen
in the laundry room?"

576
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:35,823
"On the yard?
Am I gonna get it in the fuckin' cafeteria?"

577
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:37,867
That's all I thought about.

578
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:39,285
And then I understood something.

579
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:43,164
He's gonna make me serve

580
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:46,667
every single day of my sentence

581
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:51,005
so it would end up just like this.

582
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,722
So how are you gonna do it?

583
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,934
In my apartment,
while you're asleep.

584
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,103
You see,

585
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:08,981
that's got no flavor.

586
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,691
That's got no style.

587
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:13,068
Come on, what is that?

588
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,030
While I'm asleep.

589
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:19,074
How do you think
I should do it?

590
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:21,744
I don't.

591
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:24,205
There's the rub.

592
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,336
He put his son on the job.

593
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,298
This was a bad idea.

594
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:38,260
Okay, fine.
I'm not gonna ask questions.

595
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:41,305
The first sign of trouble,

596
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,891
the kid panics,
starts shooting everywhere.

597
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:47,269
He catches my bullet
in the crossfire.

598
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:50,182
It could have been anybody's.

599
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,149
I was there. I know.

600
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:55,694
This was an accident.

601
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,447
How is it my fault?

602
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,743
I'm a fucking stand-up guy.

603
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,913
I took the fall for everyone.

604
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:08,082
You did. I know that.

605
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,000
And they pressed me.

606
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:11,669
I didn't say a word.

607
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:13,671
Not a fuckin' word.

608
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,425
And

609
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:21,637
this is what it comes to.

610
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:30,896
When did Claphands
give you this job?

611
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,111
The day

612
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:39,280
you went in.

613
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:43,367
For 28 years,
he was sitting on you?

614
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:45,452
Yes.

615
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,664
Now that is fucked.

616
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:51,959
Here's your tea, Doc.

617
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,336
Root beer float for you.

618
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,797
And surf and turf.

619
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:01,343
Alex. Can I say

620
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:03,804
that this is the best
surf and turf

621
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,890
I've seen in all my travels.

622
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:07,057
Yeah?

623
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:08,809
Can I say that?

624
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:11,562
That's very kind
of you to say, Val.

625
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,190
- Are you okay, Doc?
- Yeah.

626
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,531
So when are you gonna do it?

627
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:26,493
By 10:00 this morning,
it has to be done.

628
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:28,829
Okay.

629
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:32,958
This doesn't work.
What time is it now?

630
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:35,878
1:17 in the a.m.

631
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:39,173
That's about nine hours.

632
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:42,760
Yeah.

633
00:37:53,647 --> 00:37:55,731
- Let's get in the car.
- Hey, man, let's...

634
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:58,359
Why don't we skedaddle
down the road a bit?

635
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,862
I want to walk off this, uh,

636
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:04,865
surf and turf
and a root beer float. You know?

637
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:07,242
My digestion.

638
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,119
Sure.

639
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:13,374
So what are my options now?

640
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:15,376
You could run.

641
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:18,712
They'd find me.

642
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,592
You might buy some time.

643
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:26,804
But if I run...

644
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:28,055
What?

645
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,517
You're not gonna have
any friends anymore.

646
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:33,978
True, but

647
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,482
you'd have a
head start at least.

648
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,695
It's better this way.

649
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:44,780
How is it better?

650
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,365
It's better because

651
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,659
then I can say goodbye.

652
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,619
I don't want you
to say goodbye.

653
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,349
Well, what do you
want me to say, then?

654
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,081
I have to say goodbye.

655
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:55,624
There's nothing left

656
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:57,292
for me to say.

657
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,630
Hold up.

658
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,674
Something has presented itself.

659
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:04,758
What?

660
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:06,760
"What?"

661
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:10,931
What kind of a big, beautiful

662
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,143
beast of a car is this?

663
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:15,728
Val, no.

664
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:17,730
I think she's lonely.

665
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:20,274
I think she wants us
to take her out

666
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,608
on a date.

667
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:24,278
This car belongs to
the Jargoniew brothers.

668
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:25,946
I happen to know that.

669
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:28,907
And that's supposed
to mean something to me?

670
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:30,617
Nobody messes with these guys.

671
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:33,287
These are the type of guys
that take your kidneys out

672
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,747
and not even sell them.

673
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,791
If we only had
a coat hanger, right?

674
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,878
You can't open a car
with a coat hanger anymore, Val.

675
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,087
Says who?

676
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:43,756
Says the people who make cars.

677
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,848
What kind of asshole keeps

678
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,933
a car like this open?

679
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:57,895
These guys don't worry
about somebody stealing their car, Val.

680
00:39:58,438 --> 00:39:59,688
They better start.

681
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:01,356
Come on.

682
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:02,983
These guys, I'm telling you...

683
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,111
These morons even left the key.

684
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:09,531
Where does this fuckin' key go?

685
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:11,450
This is not a good idea, Val.

686
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:14,036
Yeah, well, my life is
full of not-good ideas.

687
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:16,038
How do you start it?
You know how?

688
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:18,832
They make cars
differently these days.

689
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:20,334
Yeah.

690
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:21,877
So do you know how to do it?

691
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:25,130
Put your foot on the brake.
Press that button.

692
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:26,256
This button?

693
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:27,633
- See?
- Holy shit.

694
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,010
- Fuck.
- Whoa!

695
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,847
Where to?

696
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:35,182
Where do you think?

697
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:39,311
- Our friend needs rescuing.
- Yes.

698
00:40:57,831 --> 00:41:00,207
Oh, I don't ever
want to end up in one of these places.

699
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,375
Me, too.

700
00:41:02,836 --> 00:41:04,169
Hey, excuse me.

701
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:05,629
Yeah?

702
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,131
Would you happen to know

703
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:09,299
where Richard Hirsch's room is?

704
00:41:09,843 --> 00:41:12,386
I like Hirsch.
Are you his friends?

705
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,470
Yeah, the best.

706
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,305
His room is

707
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:17,683
down at the end of the hall,

708
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:19,017
and to your left.

709
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:21,603
Thanks a bunch.

710
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,064
Hey, are you here
to rescue him?

711
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:25,649
How did you know?

712
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:28,819
I wish somebody would
come and rescue me.

713
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,363
We all do, honey.

714
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,716
Oh, my God!

715
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,429
I feel like I'm dreamin'.

716
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:57,723
- Hirsch.
- You're still here.

717
00:41:58,266 --> 00:41:59,725
We're all still here.

718
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:02,060
You fuckin' guys,
just like the old days.

719
00:42:02,312 --> 00:42:03,353
So?

720
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,440
Get me the fuck out of here.

721
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,775
Get me out of here.

722
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:12,988
Wait a second,
let me get a hit.

723
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:21,580
Let's escape.

724
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:22,913
You want us to bring that?

725
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,208
No, no, let's roll.

726
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:25,542
You better get dressed.

727
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:28,545
Hirschey boy.

728
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:32,049
Oh, man.
The sweet taste of freedom.

729
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:35,302
We got a ride?

730
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:36,553
This is it.

731
00:42:36,638 --> 00:42:38,472
- Huh?
- Right here.

732
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:40,807
Oh, man.

733
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,434
You get to drive it.

734
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:44,311
- Oh, ho!
- Okay.

735
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:47,105
There's no legroom here.

736
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,649
- Yeah.
- It's tight back here.

737
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:49,733
I just banged my head.

738
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,097
Yeah. To hell with your legroom.

739
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:53,153
I'm 6'2". Let's go.

740
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:56,323
- Hey.
- The situation is not ideal.

741
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:58,951
You're a master.

742
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:01,245
- Yeah, I was.
- You are.

743
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:03,330
- I was.
- You don't forget that stuff.

744
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:04,957
You're a master, Hirsch!

745
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:08,919
Four minutes ago,
you were sittin' in a dying house.

746
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,588
Now you're sittin'
in this beast of a car, you know?

747
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:13,632
The situation's okay.

748
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:15,759
All right.
Give me the key.

749
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,303
There's no key.

750
00:43:18,388 --> 00:43:19,596
Don't fuck around.
Give me the key.

751
00:43:19,681 --> 00:43:21,265
It's new.
It's a button.

752
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:23,433
- It's automatic.
- You push the button. It's computers.

753
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:24,601
- A button? Here?
- Yeah.

754
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:28,213
You put...
Put your foot on the brake at the same time.

755
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:30,565
- All right.
- Okay?

756
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:31,900
- Yeah.
- Can we go now?

757
00:43:31,985 --> 00:43:34,569
Well, there's a million dials here.
I never saw these before.

758
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:37,030
Man, this is like the future.

759
00:43:40,702 --> 00:43:42,035
Ho-ho!

760
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:44,913
Very nice.

761
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:49,626
So, Hirsch,

762
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:54,172
what have you been
doing since the last time I saw you?

763
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:56,925
Grieving, mostly.

764
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:58,844
Yeah, me, too.

765
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:00,919
Yeah, a different kind,
I guess.

766
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:08,020
Hey, I'm sorry for your loss.

767
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:10,689
I'm sorry about Julie.

768
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:12,941
Well, you know,
she was in a lot of pain.

769
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:14,151
Yeah.

770
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:16,486
Uh, what do you say?

771
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:17,863
So, how's your health?

772
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:20,699
Well, they took something
out of me a couple of months ago.

773
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:21,783
What'd they take out?

774
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:23,988
I don't know. I didn't ask.
It's none of my business.

775
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:26,246
But I'm a little more
streamlined now,

776
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:28,874
a little more aerodynamic.
Which way's the highway?

777
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,375
Not the highway, Hirsch.

778
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:32,461
Which way is the highway?
I'm not gonna ask again.

779
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:33,503
Go left.

780
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:35,881
Go left, young man.
Go left!

781
00:44:36,049 --> 00:44:37,424
- Whoa!

782
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:46,350
So, I got into gardening.

783
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:48,185
- Where, in the joint?
- Yeah.

784
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:49,853
Yeah, Julie was into that.

785
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,188
- No. Yeah?
- Yeah.

786
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:53,607
I got quite a little
green thumb, fellas.

787
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:54,941
I'm not surprised.

788
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:56,276
Whoa!

789
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:01,531
I knew a guy who got out,

790
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:03,283
committed a crime

791
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:04,910
in order to get back in

792
00:45:04,994 --> 00:45:06,745
so he could see
how his garden was doing.

793
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:09,289
It sounds like you loved it, too.

794
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:11,500
- Loved it? I love it.

795
00:45:12,085 --> 00:45:13,293
I mean, I still do.

796
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:17,506
Uh-oh.

797
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:20,133
"Uh-oh," what?

798
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,391
Don't worry.
I can lose 'em.

799
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:28,934
I got paroled today,

800
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,561
we're driving in a stolen car,

801
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:33,772
and I imagine you're
carrying a weapon.

802
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:34,856
I am.

803
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,275
- So?
- So...

804
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:39,986
I'm already fucked
five ways to Sunday.

805
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:41,238
Let's rumble!

806
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:57,504
We got two of them.

807
00:45:58,756 --> 00:45:59,923
I can see. I can see.

808
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:06,430
Hirsch,

809
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:09,307
remember the time
in that shitbox car

810
00:46:09,392 --> 00:46:10,392
with the Chinamen?

811
00:46:10,852 --> 00:46:12,185
Yeah, I do.

812
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:14,354
I think you should do that again.

813
00:46:14,856 --> 00:46:16,690
- You do, huh?
- I do.

814
00:46:39,589 --> 00:46:40,589
Hey, Hirsch.

815
00:46:41,257 --> 00:46:42,591
Nice driving, by the way.

816
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:45,051
- Thanks.
- I mean, you still got it, buddy.

817
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:46,303
Yeah, I do, don't I?

818
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:47,471
Yeah, absolutely.

819
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:49,848
It was intense.
I got a rush.

820
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:52,100
Hey, I threw up in my mouth.

821
00:46:53,394 --> 00:46:55,020
So, when did you get out, Val?

822
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:56,521
Today.

823
00:46:56,606 --> 00:46:57,856
- Today?
- Yeah.

824
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:58,940
Get the hell out of here.

825
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:00,108
No. Yeah, ask Doc.

826
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:01,485
- No kidding?
- Yeah.

827
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:03,111
We got sprung on the same day.

828
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:04,738
It's nice you can share that.

829
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:06,323
Twenty-eight years.

830
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:07,699
Twenty-eight fucking years.

831
00:47:08,201 --> 00:47:10,327
You did your time like a man, Val.

832
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:12,120
You were stand-up all the way.

833
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:15,081
But you and Doc
would have done the same.

834
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:16,625
Well, I would like to think so.

835
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:19,085
It's possible.
Either way is possible,

836
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,754
but you did it, Val.

837
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,005
True.

838
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:23,465
I can't believe

839
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:26,551
you guys didn't work
together all this time.

840
00:47:26,636 --> 00:47:27,636
- No.
- No, no, no.

841
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,387
Claphands retired us.
That was that.

842
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:30,514
And it was.

843
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,349
He can't forgive himself,

844
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:34,684
so everybody else has got to pay.

845
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:37,643
So, what do you want to do
now that you're out, Val?

846
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,689
I always wanted to
finish high school,

847
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:43,276
learn more about
the human condition.

848
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:45,445
How about you, Hirsch?

849
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:49,157
Is there anything
in this life that you haven't done

850
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:52,327
that you would like
to have a chance to do?

851
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:54,496
Two girls at the same time.

852
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:57,290
That's very doable.
No, Doc?

853
00:47:57,542 --> 00:47:59,042
Yeah, done and done.

854
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:05,340
Back so soon?

855
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:09,511
One more time,
you get the free coffee mug.

856
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:12,889
Wendy, we'd like you
to meet our associate, Richard Hirsch.

857
00:48:13,516 --> 00:48:15,267
- How are you doing?
- Hello.

858
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:18,270
He's looking for
what is known in French

859
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,647
as the menage a trois.

860
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:21,856
Shit.

861
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:25,360
Oxana's the only one working.

862
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:28,822
Irena fell down the stairs.

863
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:30,657
What about you?

864
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:34,160
Me?

865
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:36,079
No.

866
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:38,290
I don't do it for money.

867
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:40,333
Well, we won't pay you.

868
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:41,668
Oh.

869
00:48:42,545 --> 00:48:43,837
Excuse me.
What's your name?

870
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:45,755
Wendy.

871
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:55,599
You're going to have
the greatest experience of your life...

872
00:48:59,604 --> 00:49:02,022
It's up to you whether
you want to experience that or not.

873
00:49:04,734 --> 00:49:07,611
It's that important to me
and that big a deal.

874
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:10,905
Do you promise?

875
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:12,157
I swear to God.

876
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:16,369
Okay.

877
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:18,038
But it costs triple.

878
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,582
- Shouldn't it be double?
- Yeah, it should.

879
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,876
Doc, if you please.

880
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:25,670
I guess.

881
00:49:26,255 --> 00:49:27,380
Oxana.

882
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,260
Go easy on him, girls.

883
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:39,184
If I hadn't seen it,
I wouldn't believe it.

884
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:41,728
He would pump it up
on a vacuum cleaner.

885
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:44,230
Yeah?

886
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:46,941
He said, every day,
whatever he did,

887
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:48,485
he watched TV,
he listened to the radio...

888
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:51,091
He would attach... You know the
attachment on a vacuum cleaner?

889
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:53,736
- What do you call the thing that...
- It's a nozzle.

890
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:54,908
The nozzle.

891
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:57,869
Yeah, but it's for taking
the stuff off the corners of the couch.

892
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:58,995
I mean, why would you
put your dick in that?

893
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,080
It doesn't matter,

894
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:01,915
because it stretched his dick.

895
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:05,168
And his dick kept getting
bigger and bigger...

896
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:08,672
There's other ways.
There's a Chinese thing I heard about.

897
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:09,798
It's a jar.

898
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:11,549
They put bees in it.

899
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:13,301
You put it on your schlong.

900
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:15,345
The bees bite your dick.

901
00:50:17,098 --> 00:50:18,223
Hello.

902
00:50:18,307 --> 00:50:20,517
It gets all swollen, huge.

903
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,602
Yeah, but where do you put it?

904
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:25,939
I don't know.
It's good for show, anyway.

905
00:50:26,107 --> 00:50:27,982
That makes so much sense.

906
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,777
Hirsch has been up there a long time.

907
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:32,654
Good for him.

908
00:50:35,825 --> 00:50:37,117
Whoa! Here he comes!

909
00:50:39,328 --> 00:50:41,621
So the pipes still working?

910
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:43,373
You could put it that way.

911
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:46,376
Oh!

912
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,461
Okay. Jesus, that's enough.

913
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:51,172
I do not know
the English word for what I feel.

914
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:52,841
"Surprise"?

915
00:50:52,925 --> 00:50:54,509
I think it's called "lust," darling.

916
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:57,303
- Love. That is close enough.
- Good, okay.

917
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:58,513
I didn't know you had it in you.

918
00:50:58,597 --> 00:50:59,681
I did.

919
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:01,975
- Hirsch.
- Hello.

920
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:03,476
- Oh!

921
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:05,687
Okay. All right.

922
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:07,397
It's like a gum commercial.

923
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:09,482
You've ruined me
for any other man.

924
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:11,067
It's okay.
You'll get over it.

925
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:14,070
- Call me.
- Bye.

926
00:51:14,155 --> 00:51:15,488
Thank you.

927
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:20,994
Hey, Hirsch,

928
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:22,996
who knew you were
a freak in bed?

929
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,081
Huh?

930
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:27,876
Wow, you've got to feel great, no?

931
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:29,627
I don't feel that great.

932
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:30,795
Why the fuck not?

933
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:34,407
I never went out on
my wife before,

934
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:35,905
it makes me feel
like a piece of shit.

935
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,343
Hirschey, for Christ's sake,

936
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:38,887
she's been dead for ages.

937
00:51:38,971 --> 00:51:40,513
We were married
for 40 fucking years!

938
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:42,159
You don't get over
that in five minutes.

939
00:51:59,867 --> 00:52:00,867
Slow down!

940
00:52:01,327 --> 00:52:02,660
The cops are not following us.

941
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:04,746
The adrenaline keeps me alert.

942
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,707
If he slows down,
he may fall asleep.

943
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:13,129
What's that?

944
00:52:13,214 --> 00:52:14,255
- What the...

945
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:15,882
- Was that us?
- What was that?

946
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,258
Wait a minute.

947
00:52:19,595 --> 00:52:22,055
Shit, man. It's the trunk.
Someone's in the trunk.

948
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:24,599
- Yeah, yeah. Pull over.
- Okay, let's pull over.

949
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:25,725
That's not good.

950
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:28,102
It's human-sounding.

951
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:38,905
We should try it here.

952
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,324
Here.

953
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:43,493
So, we go on three, right?

954
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:45,203
Let go. I'm doing this.

955
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:48,873
One, two,

956
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,084
three!

957
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:52,168
Oh, man.

958
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,673
Get the gag out.
Get the gag out.

959
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:57,757
Yeah.

960
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:01,094
Jesus Christ!

961
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:03,012
Who was driving?

962
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:04,180
Me. I was driving.

963
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:05,640
Jesus.

964
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:07,141
How did you get in this trunk?

965
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:08,768
I'm on vacation.

966
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:10,864
- What does that mean?
- Get me out of here!

967
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:13,258
- Okay, okay, take it easy.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

968
00:53:15,985 --> 00:53:17,277
Who are you?

969
00:53:17,403 --> 00:53:18,653
I'm a friend of yours. Here.

970
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:19,737
Jeez, man!

971
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:21,906
My friend?

972
00:53:22,116 --> 00:53:23,199
Hirsch, listen.

973
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,589
You're going to have
to give me your pants.

974
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:26,870
Why?

975
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:29,274
Because she's naked.
She's going to need something to wear.

976
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:31,541
I'm not giving her my pants,
end of story.

977
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:34,210
Come on. She's got no clothes on.
Give her your pants.

978
00:53:34,295 --> 00:53:35,879
If you want to give her some pants,
give her your pants.

979
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:37,483
No, I'm not going
to give her my pants.

980
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:39,841
I gave her my jacket.
My pants are important to me.

981
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:41,217
Give me... Come on.

982
00:53:41,302 --> 00:53:43,177
What makes you the arbiter
of whose pants are important

983
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:44,721
and whose pants are not important?

984
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:46,014
You don't need pants!

985
00:53:46,515 --> 00:53:47,636
You sit in the car, driving.

986
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:50,163
- How the fuck do you need pants to drive?
- I don't need pants?

987
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:51,895
I gotta go out
and walk around, come on.

988
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:54,355
I'm not giving her
my fucking pants, end of story.

989
00:53:56,275 --> 00:53:58,401
Okay. So, that's your final offer?

990
00:53:58,485 --> 00:53:59,986
I'm not making any offers.

991
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,750
Okay, plan B.
Doc.

992
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:17,879
Song, how are you doing?

993
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,006
Do you sell women's clothing here?

994
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:22,675
Do it look like it?

995
00:54:24,136 --> 00:54:25,845
My friend just asked you a question,

996
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:28,014
a polite question.

997
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:30,016
Could you give him
a polite answer?

998
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:33,394
You no hear so good, old man?

999
00:54:33,562 --> 00:54:34,562
Or you just stupid?

1000
00:54:36,565 --> 00:54:37,607
Do you see that?

1001
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:39,317
Hey, your jab still looks pretty good.

1002
00:54:39,652 --> 00:54:40,944
- You think so?
- Yeah.

1003
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:42,862
I thought I didn't get my hips into it.

1004
00:54:43,155 --> 00:54:45,114
No, no, no.
You had a nice snap to it.

1005
00:54:46,367 --> 00:54:47,575
Thanks for saying so.

1006
00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:49,869
He's okay.

1007
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:53,139
- Do you need anything?
- Just the check.

1008
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:55,583
I think we should
know certain things about her.

1009
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:02,799
Ow.

1010
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:09,931
Here she comes.

1011
00:55:10,391 --> 00:55:11,791
Hey, look at that, the clothes fit.

1012
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:20,817
Do you feel better?

1013
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:22,068
A little. I'm starving.

1014
00:55:23,529 --> 00:55:24,988
- So, Sylvia.
- Mmm.

1015
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:27,699
Why don't we continue
where we left off?

1016
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:31,577
So I was standing,
waiting for a cab.

1017
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:33,246
This car pulls up.

1018
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:35,790
Nice car, nice smile.

1019
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:37,250
He asked me if I needed a ride.

1020
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,627
I was late, so I said, "Sure."

1021
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:42,296
Wow. You know,
you shouldn't accept rides from strangers.

1022
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:44,090
Go fuck yourself, all right?

1023
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,174
- Ooh!
- Ah.

1024
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:46,718
Okay.

1025
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:48,678
"Go fuck yourself."
I like this girl.

1026
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:51,797
There was another guy
in the back seat who I didn't see.

1027
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:54,851
They tied me up,
and took me to this warehouse.

1028
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:56,352
There were two other guys there,

1029
00:55:56,437 --> 00:55:58,062
they were just laughing,
whatever.

1030
00:55:59,982 --> 00:56:01,607
Pretty soon I was naked,

1031
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:03,276
and you can figure out the rest.

1032
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,737
So, you never saw
these guys before?

1033
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:06,821
Never.

1034
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:08,999
What, do you think I put
myself in the trunk?

1035
00:56:10,034 --> 00:56:11,534
How's everybody
doing over here?

1036
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:12,660
Good.
Thank you, Alex.

1037
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:15,121
Doc, I didn't know
you had so many friends.

1038
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:16,205
Me, too.

1039
00:56:16,749 --> 00:56:18,429
Let me know if I can
get you anything else.

1040
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,500
I'm fine, thanks.

1041
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:22,336
Anyway, I passed out for a while,

1042
00:56:24,465 --> 00:56:26,257
and woke up naked
in the trunk of the car.

1043
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:29,677
Now, I'm sitting
here with you three with a friggin'

1044
00:56:29,762 --> 00:56:31,512
Korean janitor outfit on.

1045
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,807
I had a dog named Sylvia.

1046
00:56:36,602 --> 00:56:37,852
I loved that dog.

1047
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:39,687
I think about her every day.

1048
00:56:40,481 --> 00:56:42,732
There's so goddamn much
I want to forget.

1049
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:48,321
Where was this warehouse?

1050
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:50,573
Show me where you
found the car,

1051
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:52,075
and I'll show you the place.

1052
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:54,202
We stole the car
on Rodney Street.

1053
00:56:54,286 --> 00:56:56,329
It belongs to
the Jargoniew brothers.

1054
00:56:56,705 --> 00:56:58,539
Total degenerate lowlifes.

1055
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:01,375
Animals.

1056
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:04,047
Maybe we could do something
about this situation.

1057
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,593
So what do you guys
want to do about it?

1058
00:57:12,513 --> 00:57:15,473
What, are you going to
fuck them up with a pair of pliers?

1059
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:17,016
It's only the beginning.

1060
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:20,019
Holy shit.

1061
00:57:20,729 --> 00:57:22,021
Who are you guys?

1062
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:23,439
Do you remember that?

1063
00:57:23,524 --> 00:57:24,607
Oh, my baby.

1064
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:26,192
I've missed you.

1065
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:27,276
Mr. Hirsch.

1066
00:57:27,903 --> 00:57:29,112
Remember me?

1067
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:30,363
I do this.

1068
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:38,121
What time is it?

1069
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:39,956
I don't know.
What time is it?

1070
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:43,918
It's time to kick ass,

1071
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:45,628
or chew gum.

1072
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:47,463
And guess what?

1073
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:50,258
I'm all out of gum.

1074
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:01,811
- Hey, Val.
- Yeah?

1075
00:58:02,271 --> 00:58:03,771
It's like the old days, isn't it?

1076
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:06,440
No. It's better.

1077
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,359
Yeah. Why?

1078
00:58:09,111 --> 00:58:10,653
Because this time,

1079
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:11,821
we can appreciate it.

1080
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:14,657
Yeah, that's right.
That's the reason.

1081
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:16,742
I'll see you soon.

1082
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:18,911
I'll be right here.

1083
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:23,207
Okay, if you see the place,

1084
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,502
you tell us,
and then you take off.

1085
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:28,254
Okay?

1086
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:31,257
We're just three people,
walking down the street.

1087
00:58:31,592 --> 00:58:32,592
Nothing suspicious.

1088
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:33,676
This is it.

1089
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:35,720
Around the corner.

1090
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:39,432
Okay.

1091
00:58:39,808 --> 00:58:41,517
You need to go home now, Sylvia.

1092
00:58:41,602 --> 00:58:42,602
No, I want to watch.

1093
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:43,686
Oh, no, honey.

1094
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,021
Nobody watches us work.

1095
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:47,273
Besides, there may be

1096
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,192
five or six guys in there,
you know.

1097
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:50,818
With just the two of us,

1098
00:58:50,903 --> 00:58:53,613
it may not turn out
the way we would hope.

1099
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:55,615
All right, so what?
I can help.

1100
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:57,241
Go home, get some rest.

1101
00:58:57,326 --> 00:58:58,409
No.

1102
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:00,411
We can't know
what's on the other side of that door.

1103
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:01,662
No! No.

1104
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,290
I don't think she's going to listen.

1105
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:06,292
No, she seems firm about it.

1106
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:07,877
No, she's not going to leave.

1107
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,003
Listen, honey.

1108
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:12,048
Why don't you wait here
about 10 minutes,

1109
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,342
and then come on in?

1110
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:18,137
Why are you doing this for me?

1111
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:20,681
I don't understand the question.

1112
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:23,976
You don't even know me.

1113
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:25,519
That's true.

1114
00:59:25,938 --> 00:59:29,065
But I know you,
at the same time.

1115
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:32,443
It makes me sick,
what they did to you.

1116
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:33,903
They're fucking animals!

1117
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:35,905
There used to be consequences.

1118
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:36,989
Exactly.

1119
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:40,910
They think they can
do things like this to people,

1120
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:42,495
and get away with it.

1121
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:45,456
Well, we're the fucking consequences.

1122
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:53,464
And now for my next trick.

1123
00:59:57,511 --> 00:59:58,761
Give me those picks.

1124
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:06,560
It's probably open.

1125
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:14,443
You're right.

1126
01:00:49,313 --> 01:00:50,563
- Yeah, man.

1127
01:00:55,986 --> 01:00:58,279
Hey, fellows.
What's going on?

1128
01:00:58,572 --> 01:00:59,905
How the fuck
did you get in here?

1129
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:01,741
We're friends of Sylvia.

1130
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:03,075
You remember Sylvia,

1131
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:05,578
the naked girl
you put in your trunk.

1132
01:01:07,748 --> 01:01:09,040
How the fuck
do you know about...

1133
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:14,045
All right.

1134
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:16,324
Does anybody else
want to get shot?

1135
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:25,264
Okay.

1136
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:27,433
Remember, fellows...

1137
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:30,770
You reap what you sow.

1138
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:36,150
Yes. I would like to report
a large cache of weapons and drugs.

1139
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:38,944
What's the address here?

1140
01:01:39,279 --> 01:01:40,446
It's Rodney Street.

1141
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,406
I know that.
What number?

1142
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:45,451
Oh, what's the number here?

1143
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:49,538
I asked you a question.

1144
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:50,706
Go fuck yourself.

1145
01:01:50,791 --> 01:01:51,749
Ooh!

1146
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,211
I didn't hear the number.

1147
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:59,965
172.

1148
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:01,842
172 Rodney.

1149
01:02:02,177 --> 01:02:03,844
Thank you so much.
Have a great night.

1150
01:02:04,763 --> 01:02:06,222
You're your own
worst fucking enemy.

1151
01:02:07,891 --> 01:02:08,891
Shit!

1152
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:13,562
Whoa!
Look who's here.

1153
01:02:24,408 --> 01:02:25,616
Oh, fuck.

1154
01:02:27,536 --> 01:02:29,120
Good evening, gentlemen.

1155
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:30,996
Remember her?

1156
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:33,666
The belle of the ball.

1157
01:02:35,335 --> 01:02:37,169
I think it's time for us to exit.

1158
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:39,130
Stage left.

1159
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:42,591
Okay, Sylvie.

1160
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:43,759
Yeah?

1161
01:02:43,844 --> 01:02:46,303
You know, you've got
about eight minutes before the cops come.

1162
01:02:46,513 --> 01:02:47,513
Thank you.

1163
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:48,639
You're welcome.

1164
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:51,684
Good luck, fellows.

1165
01:02:51,852 --> 01:02:52,852
Enjoy.

1166
01:02:54,813 --> 01:02:56,397
You guys like the ballet,
don't you?

1167
01:02:58,567 --> 01:03:00,359
The Nutcracker was my favorite.

1168
01:03:08,869 --> 01:03:10,953
Here. Here's your gun back.

1169
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:14,748
I got blood all over my jacket.

1170
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:16,375
Look at this.

1171
01:03:17,252 --> 01:03:18,919
You can wash them.

1172
01:03:20,005 --> 01:03:22,423
You use the biological stuff,

1173
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:23,707
it takes the stains right out.

1174
01:03:23,717 --> 01:03:25,301
What the fuck is that, biological?

1175
01:03:25,677 --> 01:03:27,970
I'm telling you,
you can take that stain right out.

1176
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:30,222
No, you can't get these stains out.

1177
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:32,475
It doesn't matter
how many times you wash them.

1178
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:34,226
A blood stain stays in.

1179
01:03:34,394 --> 01:03:36,061
You can't get this fucking stuff out.

1180
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:40,524
We'll get you a new suit.

1181
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:42,526
- A new suit?
- Yeah.

1182
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:45,571
That's a different conversation.

1183
01:03:47,741 --> 01:03:48,991
What's going on here?

1184
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:52,369
What's this?

1185
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:55,789
Hey!

1186
01:04:05,717 --> 01:04:07,301
It's always something, isn't it?

1187
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:08,677
Yeah.

1188
01:04:10,138 --> 01:04:11,430
But he got his last wish.

1189
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:13,265
Yeah.

1190
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:16,352
We got to work together again.

1191
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:17,811
Yeah.

1192
01:04:18,355 --> 01:04:20,439
We got to work together again.

1193
01:04:24,945 --> 01:04:25,945
So?

1194
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:30,366
I think we should bury him.

1195
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:35,204
Hirsch.

1196
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:43,212
Do you know where
Nina Hirsch works?

1197
01:04:43,463 --> 01:04:44,797
I think she's over there.

1198
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:50,970
Hey, Nina.

1199
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:52,846
Do you remember us?

1200
01:04:52,931 --> 01:04:54,348
Sure. How's your pecker?

1201
01:04:55,225 --> 01:04:56,225
It's all right.

1202
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:58,811
Listen, your dad's dead.

1203
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:04,316
What?

1204
01:05:04,484 --> 01:05:05,609
We're sorry.

1205
01:05:06,611 --> 01:05:09,154
But how do you know he's dead?

1206
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:12,241
We took him for a night out is all,

1207
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:14,451
and, well, you know, he died.

1208
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:21,417
Where is he?

1209
01:05:21,501 --> 01:05:24,211
He's outside in a stolen sports car,

1210
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:25,588
in the front seat.

1211
01:05:33,013 --> 01:05:34,013
See?

1212
01:05:34,514 --> 01:05:35,848
He's still warm.

1213
01:05:36,725 --> 01:05:39,602
It didn't happen
more than 30 minutes ago.

1214
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,195
What were you guys doing?

1215
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:52,740
Having fun, just like old times.

1216
01:05:53,742 --> 01:05:55,159
He went out with a bang.

1217
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:57,786
Is there a family plot or something?

1218
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:01,749
We thought we should bury him.

1219
01:06:05,629 --> 01:06:06,629
You...

1220
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:09,089
You want to bury him now?

1221
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:12,551
Tonight?

1222
01:06:13,261 --> 01:06:16,221
Well, for us,
it's got to be tonight.

1223
01:06:19,059 --> 01:06:20,225
They won't miss this.

1224
01:06:22,437 --> 01:06:23,896
We'll give it to you, Hirsch.

1225
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:26,690
Here you go, my boy.

1226
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:33,155
I think Hirsch would be glad
to be next to your mother.

1227
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:38,118
He bought this plot
when I was four.

1228
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:40,996
He told me,

1229
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:44,458
"Darling, just come visit me
from time to time."

1230
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:47,044
"Let me know how it's going."

1231
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:49,588
Dad,

1232
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:51,382
it's going okay.

1233
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:54,677
You taught me

1234
01:06:55,929 --> 01:06:57,888
that the best thing a person could be

1235
01:06:57,972 --> 01:06:59,264
is of some use.

1236
01:07:03,144 --> 01:07:04,937
You were of so much use to me.

1237
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:10,401
Always.

1238
01:07:11,903 --> 01:07:12,903
Right.

1239
01:07:16,074 --> 01:07:18,659
Val, we should say something, too.

1240
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:22,913
Would you do it?
I'm not good at stuff like this.

1241
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:25,833
Yeah.

1242
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:27,918
Okay, I can do it.

1243
01:07:29,129 --> 01:07:31,338
Hirsch was a good friend.

1244
01:07:33,133 --> 01:07:34,842
I remember one time,

1245
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:37,928
we robbed this liquor store,

1246
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:41,557
and he ran over a dog.

1247
01:07:43,727 --> 01:07:46,895
- He cried for two days over that dog.

1248
01:07:50,024 --> 01:07:51,775
Anyway, he will be missed

1249
01:07:53,445 --> 01:07:54,778
by so many of us

1250
01:07:55,447 --> 01:07:56,739
that got left behind.

1251
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:02,202
He was a witness to our lives.

1252
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:05,164
Not many of those left.

1253
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:09,835
So there's one less person on this Earth

1254
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:13,046
who knows our name,

1255
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:15,924
who remembers our childhood,

1256
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:20,429
who shared

1257
01:08:22,182 --> 01:08:24,099
in each moment as it passed.

1258
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:28,854
You know, they say we die twice,

1259
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:33,025
once when the breath
leaves our body, and once

1260
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,528
when the last person
we know says our name.

1261
01:08:39,282 --> 01:08:40,657
And then,

1262
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:44,328
Hirsch's life will be forgotten,

1263
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:46,538
like all the other poor

1264
01:08:49,209 --> 01:08:52,377
fucks that ever
had the glory of living.

1265
01:08:55,173 --> 01:08:56,173
Amen.

1266
01:08:57,425 --> 01:08:58,717
- Amen.
- Amen.

1267
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:04,640
What?

1268
01:09:04,724 --> 01:09:06,642
Nothing.
That was really good.

1269
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:09,645
It was good?

1270
01:09:10,605 --> 01:09:11,855
The best I ever heard.

1271
01:09:12,357 --> 01:09:13,357
You think so?

1272
01:09:13,441 --> 01:09:15,108
- Really good, Val.
- Fuck you.

1273
01:09:16,361 --> 01:09:18,403
Thank you, Valentine.

1274
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:20,531
Yeah, well, it was nothing.

1275
01:09:20,615 --> 01:09:22,699
No. Valentine, listen to me.

1276
01:09:25,537 --> 01:09:27,371
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

1277
01:09:28,915 --> 01:09:29,915
Thank you.

1278
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:41,093
Good night.

1279
01:09:47,267 --> 01:09:49,309
There's nothing you can say about that.

1280
01:09:49,394 --> 01:09:50,394
No.

1281
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:55,899
So,

1282
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:59,361
are you going to do my eulogy?

1283
01:10:00,655 --> 01:10:01,738
I'm working on it.

1284
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:07,953
How much time I got left?

1285
01:10:10,582 --> 01:10:12,124
Four hours, about.

1286
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:16,795
I could use a steak.

1287
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:18,881
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

1288
01:10:19,132 --> 01:10:20,507
Let's go.

1289
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:40,068
And after breakfast,

1290
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:42,404
we'll get you a new suit.

1291
01:10:43,406 --> 01:10:44,531
Oh.

1292
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:46,825
Then you can shoot me in the head,

1293
01:10:47,327 --> 01:10:48,911
so it doesn't fuck up my suit.

1294
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:51,413
That's right.
I shoot you in the head.

1295
01:10:52,707 --> 01:10:54,249
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1296
01:10:56,294 --> 01:10:58,211
Look at this,
my car is still here.

1297
01:11:00,131 --> 01:11:01,423
What, are you surprised?

1298
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:04,384
Who's going to want to
take that piece of shit?

1299
01:11:07,555 --> 01:11:09,640
- Well, good morning, fellows.
- Hi, Alex.

1300
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:12,351
Are you two up early,
or are you going to bed late?

1301
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:14,770
And what's going on here
with all this dirt?

1302
01:11:14,854 --> 01:11:16,334
- Yeah, well, you know...
- Gardening.

1303
01:11:16,606 --> 01:11:19,149
We've been doing a spot
of late-night gardening.

1304
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:20,525
Huh.

1305
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:22,235
Yeah, you should try it some time.

1306
01:11:22,904 --> 01:11:24,696
Well, look at you, young lady.

1307
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:26,990
You're pulling
a long shift tonight, huh?

1308
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:28,867
Yeah. I don't sleep.

1309
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:31,881
I sort of like being awake
when everyone else is sleeping, you know?

1310
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,872
- It gives me a sense of...
- Being alive.

1311
01:11:34,165 --> 01:11:35,207
Yes.

1312
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:37,084
I know the feeling, believe me.

1313
01:11:37,168 --> 01:11:38,961
Okay. So, what will it be, Doc?

1314
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:41,505
Two eggs over easy.

1315
01:11:41,589 --> 01:11:42,589
Of course.

1316
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:45,384
And I will have a steak,
waffles, a Greek omelet,

1317
01:11:45,927 --> 01:11:47,302
a Greek salad,
and a banana malt.

1318
01:11:48,388 --> 01:11:49,388
And another steak.

1319
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:51,619
- And a coffee.
- And a coffee.

1320
01:11:51,683 --> 01:11:52,849
- Oh, and a muffin.
- And a muffin.

1321
01:11:52,934 --> 01:11:53,976
If you don't mind.

1322
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:55,060
I don't mind.

1323
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:58,230
You are a very hungry man, Val.

1324
01:11:58,481 --> 01:11:59,481
Uh...

1325
01:11:59,899 --> 01:12:01,441
I'm leaving on a long trip.

1326
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:03,360
Oh.

1327
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:05,204
Just when we were
getting to know each other.

1328
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:07,364
Yeah, ain't that too bad?

1329
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:09,199
I'll put that order right in.

1330
01:12:09,283 --> 01:12:10,325
Yeah.

1331
01:12:11,577 --> 01:12:13,328
I'm going to take
a wild guess here,

1332
01:12:13,746 --> 01:12:16,957
but Alex, the waitress,
is your granddaughter, no?

1333
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:20,752
Yes.

1334
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:23,797
You got to tell her.

1335
01:12:23,923 --> 01:12:25,007
I'm going to.

1336
01:12:25,216 --> 01:12:26,258
Yeah?

1337
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:28,176
Why haven't you told her already?

1338
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:29,970
I can't.

1339
01:12:30,096 --> 01:12:31,096
How come?

1340
01:12:31,639 --> 01:12:32,639
You can.

1341
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:34,266
Believe me.

1342
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:37,728
The truth will set you free, brother.

1343
01:12:37,979 --> 01:12:39,021
Okay, but not today.

1344
01:12:39,105 --> 01:12:40,105
Then when?

1345
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:41,314
Tomorrow.

1346
01:12:42,817 --> 01:12:44,568
Tomorrow? Do you promise?

1347
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:47,738
Tomorrow, I'll tell her everything.

1348
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:51,533
Okay, tomorrow.

1349
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:54,786
My last meal.

1350
01:12:57,415 --> 01:12:58,415
Yeah.

1351
01:13:03,463 --> 01:13:05,130
Don't go sentimental on me now.

1352
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:06,214
Excuse me.

1353
01:13:26,486 --> 01:13:27,819
There you go.

1354
01:13:29,864 --> 01:13:31,031
Thank you.

1355
01:13:32,366 --> 01:13:33,366
So, Val?

1356
01:13:33,451 --> 01:13:34,451
So, Alex.

1357
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:36,328
Do you mind if I sit?

1358
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:38,705
No. Go ahead, please.

1359
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:43,251
So Doc comes in here
every morning, you know.

1360
01:13:43,336 --> 01:13:44,377
Mmm-hmm.

1361
01:13:44,462 --> 01:13:46,338
And he always orders
the same exact thing.

1362
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:48,799
Oh, the tyranny of habit.

1363
01:13:56,766 --> 01:13:57,766
It's me.

1364
01:13:57,850 --> 01:13:58,934
Is it done?

1365
01:14:00,311 --> 01:14:01,561
What is he like?

1366
01:14:02,355 --> 01:14:04,689
I can't help but wonder
about most of my customers,

1367
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:07,442
but I wonder
about him the most.

1368
01:14:07,735 --> 01:14:09,194
I don't know.

1369
01:14:10,321 --> 01:14:12,197
What do you imagine he's like?

1370
01:14:13,157 --> 01:14:14,950
Please. Mercy,

1371
01:14:15,326 --> 01:14:16,618
is all I'm saying.
Mercy.

1372
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:18,120
I know it was your only son.

1373
01:14:18,204 --> 01:14:20,539
- I know what that must be like.
- "Please"?

1374
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:22,624
"Please"?

1375
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:25,585
Please bring back my only son!

1376
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:27,963
See how far "please" gets you!

1377
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:31,007
We're all out of mercy here.

1378
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:33,051
Why?

1379
01:14:33,219 --> 01:14:35,887
He'll be dead soon enough.
Just give him a few more years.

1380
01:14:35,972 --> 01:14:37,055
What's the difference?

1381
01:14:37,181 --> 01:14:38,723
What is the fucking difference?

1382
01:14:39,392 --> 01:14:40,934
How's Alex, fuckface?

1383
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:43,478
What?

1384
01:14:43,563 --> 01:14:45,147
Alex. You know
who I'm talking about.

1385
01:14:45,231 --> 01:14:48,400
I bet you my left nut
you can see the bitch right this second.

1386
01:14:50,069 --> 01:14:51,611
It would be a fucking shame

1387
01:14:51,696 --> 01:14:53,363
to see such a young hottie get into

1388
01:14:53,656 --> 01:14:55,365
an awful accident.

1389
01:14:56,242 --> 01:14:57,993
A fucking waste, yeah?

1390
01:14:59,954 --> 01:15:00,954
You wouldn't.

1391
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:02,247
Oh, really?

1392
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:05,208
Are you sure?

1393
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:08,545
I imagine he's a man
who knows what it's like to be alone,

1394
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:11,756
to live life with a lot of regret,

1395
01:15:13,301 --> 01:15:16,344
and that maybe he comes
here every day just to be around other people,

1396
01:15:16,429 --> 01:15:17,909
even if it's only for a half an hour,

1397
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:19,931
just to be around people.

1398
01:15:21,184 --> 01:15:22,893
That's right, that's exactly right.

1399
01:15:24,103 --> 01:15:25,103
Sometimes

1400
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:26,897
what we imagine

1401
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:29,941
and the world aren't different things.

1402
01:15:30,902 --> 01:15:33,486
Sometimes,
they're the same exact thing.

1403
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:35,113
Yeah.

1404
01:15:36,032 --> 01:15:37,490
I thought so.

1405
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:39,868
Finish this, fucknut,

1406
01:15:39,994 --> 01:15:42,954
or accidents can and will happen.

1407
01:16:17,865 --> 01:16:19,157
I think your food is ready.

1408
01:16:19,367 --> 01:16:20,992
I wish we could have
talked more, Val.

1409
01:16:21,494 --> 01:16:23,203
Me, too. It was nice
sitting here with you.

1410
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:24,663
Yeah, it was.

1411
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:47,686
Is the church open?

1412
01:16:49,146 --> 01:16:50,689
Church is always open.

1413
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:54,067
Yeah.

1414
01:17:14,714 --> 01:17:17,048
So, do you start or do I start?

1415
01:17:17,383 --> 01:17:18,842
- I forgot.
- You do.

1416
01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:21,177
I do. Right, okay.

1417
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:25,056
So, forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

1418
01:17:25,683 --> 01:17:27,083
How long since
your last confession?

1419
01:17:27,977 --> 01:17:28,977
Um...

1420
01:17:29,895 --> 01:17:32,188
Sixty years, give or take a few.

1421
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:34,899
Okay.

1422
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:38,737
Now, confess each and every serious sin
that separates you from Christ.

1423
01:17:38,821 --> 01:17:42,574
Oh, no.
We'd be here forever, Father.

1424
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:45,410
Can we just deal
with what happened today?

1425
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:48,496
So far,

1426
01:17:49,749 --> 01:17:51,416
I shot a guy in the kneecap

1427
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:53,084
and one in the arm.

1428
01:17:54,086 --> 01:17:57,130
I stole a bunch
of prescription drugs,

1429
01:17:58,049 --> 01:17:59,507
and a sweet-ass car.

1430
01:18:01,886 --> 01:18:04,387
Punched a Korean
store clerk in the face,

1431
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:06,264
took his clothes,

1432
01:18:06,766 --> 01:18:08,892
and fucked a Russian
hooker four times.

1433
01:18:10,478 --> 01:18:12,520
That was all today?

1434
01:18:13,397 --> 01:18:14,481
Uh...

1435
01:18:14,815 --> 01:18:16,816
Since noon yesterday, yeah.

1436
01:18:17,276 --> 01:18:19,069
But I did some good things,
too, Father.

1437
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:22,364
I buried a friend.

1438
01:18:25,242 --> 01:18:28,787
I helped this young woman
take her life back.

1439
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:30,789
And...

1440
01:18:31,499 --> 01:18:34,793
I eased my best friend's pain.

1441
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:40,965
And for 28 years,

1442
01:18:41,801 --> 01:18:43,551
I kept my mouth shut.

1443
01:18:52,436 --> 01:18:55,480
So, can I say a Hail Mary
and be done here?

1444
01:18:57,608 --> 01:18:59,984
No, I don't think
that you're going to be able to

1445
01:19:00,528 --> 01:19:02,779
Hail Mary your way out of this one.

1446
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:07,242
You're right.

1447
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:10,120
You're right, I guess.

1448
01:19:11,705 --> 01:19:13,498
I'm wasting both our time.

1449
01:19:15,251 --> 01:19:16,334
Here. Go ahead.

1450
01:19:17,336 --> 01:19:18,586
Why don't you take this?

1451
01:19:18,921 --> 01:19:20,630
- What's that?
- This is for your troubles.

1452
01:19:20,714 --> 01:19:23,258
- No.
- Buy yourself a steak dinner or something.

1453
01:19:23,342 --> 01:19:24,843
- But I can't.
- Take it, Father.

1454
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:27,387
I don't need it where I'm going.

1455
01:19:39,859 --> 01:19:40,900
What?

1456
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:42,193
So?

1457
01:19:44,655 --> 01:19:46,614
Did you receive absolution?

1458
01:19:47,908 --> 01:19:49,659
Well, close enough.

1459
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:53,746
Let's go see about those suits.

1460
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:57,000
You want to hurry up?

1461
01:20:07,845 --> 01:20:09,345
What about this one?

1462
01:20:09,513 --> 01:20:10,555
What?

1463
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:12,279
Am I going to play
a game of shuffleboard?

1464
01:20:13,017 --> 01:20:14,893
Come on, let's be serious here.

1465
01:20:15,769 --> 01:20:18,062
- Okay.
- Looking for the suit. Find the suit.

1466
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:19,481
This one.

1467
01:20:20,733 --> 01:20:21,733
What size is it?

1468
01:20:23,986 --> 01:20:25,028
Forty-two, long.

1469
01:20:25,112 --> 01:20:26,404
I wear 40 regular.

1470
01:20:31,785 --> 01:20:32,785
Hey.

1471
01:20:35,331 --> 01:20:37,332
You said no crying.

1472
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:39,417
No crying for you.

1473
01:20:39,877 --> 01:20:41,252
We didn't say anything about me.

1474
01:20:45,758 --> 01:20:47,759
Okay. Hey, this one.

1475
01:20:52,765 --> 01:20:54,182
It's beautiful.
Look at this.

1476
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:55,600
It will look great on you.

1477
01:20:56,185 --> 01:20:58,394
Clothes just hang
off you the right way.

1478
01:20:58,521 --> 01:21:00,146
- You think so?
- Definitely.

1479
01:21:01,607 --> 01:21:02,690
Why don't you try one on?

1480
01:21:02,775 --> 01:21:03,900
No, I'm okay.

1481
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,653
Your wardrobe could use a little help.

1482
01:21:07,738 --> 01:21:08,738
You think?

1483
01:21:09,114 --> 01:21:12,450
Uh, yeah. I wasn't
going to say anything, but...

1484
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:14,202
Yeah? But what?

1485
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:16,037
But you dress

1486
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:18,623
like you're on your way
to the gin rummy championship of the world.

1487
01:21:18,749 --> 01:21:19,707
Here.

1488
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:21,251
No, I prefer black.

1489
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:25,672
You're right.
Black suits you.

1490
01:21:28,968 --> 01:21:30,134
Here's black.

1491
01:21:30,803 --> 01:21:31,803
What do you think?

1492
01:21:33,222 --> 01:21:35,557
I can't see myself
wearing that every day.

1493
01:21:36,225 --> 01:21:37,392
I don't see myself in it.

1494
01:21:40,354 --> 01:21:41,715
Will you look at these guys, Paul?

1495
01:21:42,648 --> 01:21:43,648
Look at them!

1496
01:21:44,233 --> 01:21:45,525
They're trying on clothes.

1497
01:21:46,527 --> 01:21:47,819
You're fucking shopping?

1498
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:48,903
What?

1499
01:21:48,988 --> 01:21:50,154
What do you mean, "What?"

1500
01:21:51,073 --> 01:21:53,234
Isn't there something else
you're supposed to be doing?

1501
01:21:54,285 --> 01:21:56,160
You know,
Claphands had you figured, Doc.

1502
01:21:56,328 --> 01:21:57,996
He said you don't got
the stones anymore.

1503
01:21:58,372 --> 01:21:59,664
Whoa!

1504
01:21:59,832 --> 01:22:01,124
Larry, please.

1505
01:22:02,126 --> 01:22:04,335
Before you do this,
there's one thing you should know.

1506
01:22:07,006 --> 01:22:08,172
Here, here!

1507
01:22:19,518 --> 01:22:20,727
You.

1508
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:22,770
Call Claphands.

1509
01:22:23,522 --> 01:22:26,190
Tell him, "Stay out of my action."

1510
01:22:26,859 --> 01:22:28,109
"I got this."

1511
01:22:28,652 --> 01:22:29,736
Okay.

1512
01:22:32,031 --> 01:22:33,031
Go.

1513
01:22:42,374 --> 01:22:43,374
Nice work.

1514
01:22:43,917 --> 01:22:45,126
In the old days,

1515
01:22:45,377 --> 01:22:47,097
I would have had him
with the throat punch.

1516
01:22:47,713 --> 01:22:48,713
You gotta admit

1517
01:22:48,922 --> 01:22:50,632
it felt good, though, didn't it?

1518
01:22:51,884 --> 01:22:53,343
Damn right.

1519
01:22:54,136 --> 01:22:55,303
It felt good.

1520
01:22:57,222 --> 01:22:59,724
Oh, look at you.
You look great.

1521
01:23:01,060 --> 01:23:02,977
No. You look great.

1522
01:23:03,604 --> 01:23:05,021
- Do I?
- Yeah.

1523
01:23:05,898 --> 01:23:07,065
Well, I feel great.

1524
01:23:08,776 --> 01:23:11,069
That's what I'm saying.
A change of wardrobe

1525
01:23:11,945 --> 01:23:13,154
can be just the thing.

1526
01:23:13,238 --> 01:23:14,530
- Definitely.
- Yeah.

1527
01:23:19,662 --> 01:23:20,662
May I?

1528
01:23:20,746 --> 01:23:21,746
Be my guest.

1529
01:23:25,209 --> 01:23:26,167
- Boom.
- Whoa.

1530
01:23:27,544 --> 01:23:28,544
Fuck!

1531
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:30,461
- Did you see that?
- I did.

1532
01:23:30,547 --> 01:23:32,548
It was good, though.
I got my hips in it.

1533
01:23:34,093 --> 01:23:35,385
He's still alive.

1534
01:23:38,722 --> 01:23:40,848
So.

1535
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:42,225
What time is it?

1536
01:23:43,268 --> 01:23:44,394
It's time.

1537
01:23:47,189 --> 01:23:48,231
Already?

1538
01:23:50,984 --> 01:23:51,984
I'm sorry.

1539
01:23:53,654 --> 01:23:54,987
Well, it had to come, didn't it?

1540
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:56,280
It did.

1541
01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:00,159
Time waits for no man.

1542
01:24:01,328 --> 01:24:02,453
It doesn't.

1543
01:24:03,122 --> 01:24:04,288
Hmm.

1544
01:24:13,382 --> 01:24:15,258
I'm going to miss the spring.

1545
01:24:17,970 --> 01:24:19,429
And my flowers.

1546
01:24:20,723 --> 01:24:22,348
The birds returning.

1547
01:24:23,809 --> 01:24:25,143
Their song.

1548
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:27,645
The whole world,

1549
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:30,273
you know, renewing itself again.

1550
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:33,192
Your fucking face.

1551
01:24:56,175 --> 01:24:57,633
See.

1552
01:24:58,177 --> 01:25:00,845
This didn't feel weird.
Did it?

1553
01:25:00,971 --> 01:25:02,013
No.

1554
01:25:41,762 --> 01:25:43,429
- Hello.
- Alex.

1555
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:46,557
What do you think of my sunrises?

1556
01:25:50,813 --> 01:25:52,563
I think they're beautiful.

1557
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:55,148
I wanted you to know
some of the things I thought,

1558
01:25:55,943 --> 01:25:57,944
saw, some of the things I felt.

1559
01:26:02,241 --> 01:26:03,407
I do.

1560
01:26:05,327 --> 01:26:08,412
I know they look like the sunrise,
but I was painting you.

1561
01:26:12,209 --> 01:26:13,334
In the closet,

1562
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:15,044
on the top shelf,
there's a shoebox.

1563
01:26:16,755 --> 01:26:19,215
Put the phone down.
Open it. I'll wait. No rush.

1564
01:26:20,217 --> 01:26:21,300
Okay.

1565
01:26:58,213 --> 01:26:59,964
Doc, this is too much.

1566
01:27:00,549 --> 01:27:02,300
No, it's all there is.

1567
01:27:03,677 --> 01:27:06,512
Welcome home.
The rent is paid for a year.

1568
01:27:08,307 --> 01:27:10,224
It's not much, but it's yours.

1569
01:27:11,476 --> 01:27:13,477
What do you mean?
When am I going to see you again?

1570
01:27:14,062 --> 01:27:15,229
I don't know.

1571
01:27:18,817 --> 01:27:20,318
I love you, Alex.

1572
01:27:21,445 --> 01:27:22,570
Grandpa.

1573
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:24,572
I love you, too.

1574
01:27:26,825 --> 01:27:28,284
I have to go now.

1575
01:27:51,892 --> 01:27:54,018
Are you sure you want to do this?

1576
01:27:55,395 --> 01:27:57,104
You can change your mind,
you know.

1577
01:27:58,273 --> 01:28:00,024
I know, but I won't.

1578
01:28:03,570 --> 01:28:05,112
You took care of Alex?

1579
01:28:07,032 --> 01:28:08,658
I'm so proud of you for that.

1580
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:11,202
Tomorrow became today.

1581
01:28:12,454 --> 01:28:13,829
It usually does.

1582
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,000
So?

1583
01:28:19,252 --> 01:28:20,586
What will it be?

1584
01:28:22,589 --> 01:28:25,174
Chew gum or kick ass?

1585
01:28:25,842 --> 01:28:27,426
I'm all out of gum.

1586
01:28:39,523 --> 01:28:40,564
Get me a gun!

1587
