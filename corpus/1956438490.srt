work at the Thrifty Mart

122
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:27,619

the car back that I borrowed

my coworkers are eating

Yeah.

165
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,848
My friend's in a band who,
uh, they sound like‐‐

166
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,851
like them, from where
I used to live.

167
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,770

the lacrosse team happy,

175

hard to do, right?

Gotta blow.

178
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,963
Um, what the hell
did she just say to you?!

179
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,049

you orally?

180

Gothic slut!

00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,595
You were supposed to pick me up.
Yeah, well.

183
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,596
Hey, Katie.

184
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:52,597
Did you see my Insty?

185
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:53,723
Yeah, cute.

186
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:54,891
Oh, hi, Emily.

187
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:55,892
You saw Insty this morning?

188
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,977
(Emily)
Yeah, uh‐huh.

189
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,646
Well?

190
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,565
Look, I‐‐ I never said
I was gonna pick you up,

191
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:03,733
and she's not Goth.

192
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,652
Oh God,
look at this, Charlie.

193
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,737
You can get a sexually
transmitted disease

194
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:08,780
from Gothic women.

195
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,074
She's not Goth.

196
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,075
She's British.

197
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,702
Are you kidding me?!

198
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,578
Well, do you know what British
girls can give?

199
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,579
Okay, well, look at this.

200
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,123
Look at this!

201
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:21,543
Oh...

202
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,044
(Telulah, British accent)
If you knew anything more

203
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,088
than how to give your pony
an erection‐‐

204
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:28,091
exclamation point,
exclamation point‐‐

205
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:31,553
(using normal voice) then you'd know that emo took the place of Goth

206
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:32,846
a long time ago

207
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,639
and scene took the place of emo,

208
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,684
my fashion‐blogging
Insty queen.

209
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,645
Sure, there are still
girls like Holly,

210
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,523
who need a boyfriend to validate
their high school existence,

211
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,692
but these days there's
so much more here

212
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:46,693
at Huntville High.

213
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,028
That's right.

214
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,488
It's no longer just popular
kids, nerds, jocks,

215
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,658
and stoners who gather in high
school hallways across America.

216
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,995
♪ Of all the right guys... ♪

217
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,496
Sure, traditional social groups

218
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,665
still exist...

219
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,542
but with social networking,

220
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,627
it brings a new,
ever‐changing assortment.

221
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,671
♪ She's showing off
the way she walks ♪

222
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,716
♪ It's on ♪

223
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,719
♪ Take me show me ♪

224
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,888
♪ Whoa‐oh, whoa‐oh ♪

225
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,891
Like you can tell who's
a freshman pretty easily

226
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,727
because they all seem to thing
UGGs are still a thing.

227
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,729
But by this time next year,

228
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,732
many will have graduated
over to the fashion bloggers.

229
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,650
They drink their coffee black.

230
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,778
It's very serious.

231
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:31,821
Now the fashion bloggers
often overlap with

232
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,698
the preppy, popular girls.

233
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,785
But if you look at how they
punctuate their text,

234
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,745
you can definitely
tell the difference.

235
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,581
Don't let their pearl earrings

236
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,792
and Lilly Pulitzer
lifestyle deceive you.

237
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,169
These girls can be found
either shoe shopping

238
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,796
or puking in your living room.

239
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:50,715
Check Vine for daily updates.

240
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,842
Lacrosse is big here
but so is soccer,

241
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:56,137
and ironically these teams
compete with each other.

242
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:59,099
But instead of black eyes
and bloody noses,

243
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:02,060
last season these teams
got into a huge Twitter fight,

244
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,729
and while the subtweets were
quite amusing,

245
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,148
the coaches were forced to ban
all players from Twitter

246
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,983
for the entire season.

247
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:12,112
Personally, I'd rather
be punched.

248
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,196
Others will end up here.

249
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,615
Among the MySpace leftovers.

250
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,991
This is a dangerous group

251
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,661
because just one match can cause
spontaneous combustion

252
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:24,833
But you know what really
irritates me?

253
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,836
Here at Huntville High the most
popular girl in our school

254
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:29,671
doesn't even go to our school.

255
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,506
She doesn't even live
in the same state

256
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,383
and she's the most
popular girl here.

257
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,100
(man on PA)
<i>Good morning.</i>

258
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,561
<i>As part of Huntville High's</i>
<i>new health initiative,</i>

259
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:45,979
<i>cakes and cookies</i>
<i>have been removed</i>

260
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,648
<i>from all school menus.</i>

261
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,983
<i>A bake sale will be held today</i>

262
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,860
<i>to raise funds</i>
<i>for the initiative.</i>

263
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,735
(students gasping)

264
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,112
Surprise, people.

265
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,573
We're having a quiz today.

266
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:57,824
Sit down, Mr. Edwards!

267
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,915
Okay, people, these questions
will be familiar to those

268
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:09,002
of you who actually listened
this week.

269
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,462
No, no whining.

270
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,715
Riley, what's my motto?

271
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,842
"I'm a big baldie with a cow
brand on my arm."

272
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:16,801
Say it, Riley.

273
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,469
"Those who don't
understand history

274
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,846
are desperate to repeat it
this summer."

275
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,764
"I'm a big baldie with a cow
brand on my arm."

276
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,057
Say it!

277
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,934
"I'm a big baldie with a cow
brand on my arm."

278
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,769
(class laughing)

279
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:30,940
He‐‐ he Evangelicalisted me.

280
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,817
These are Greek letters.

281
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:33,943
Do you even know
where Greece is?!

282
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,117
Yes, Kim.

283
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,870
I'm feeling frightened
and disturbed, Mr. Somma.

284
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,875
Me too, Kim, me too.

285
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:49,876
People...

286
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:50,793
That's Darvan.

287
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:51,961
He's in a category
I didn't mention

288
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,379
because he's very rare.

289
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,881
He's a super senior,

290
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,634
meaning he's been a high school
senior here more than once.

291
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:58,801
Why didn't you tell me
we were having a test today,

292
00:11:58,801 --> 00:11:59,886
Telulah Farrow?!

293
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,471
...possibility
of a quiz.

294
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,766
Get started!

295
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,976
Yo, Telulah Farrow, what's
the answer, Telulah Farrow?

296
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:10,521
Shh, Darvan,
it's a surprise quiz.

297
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,856
That's not even
a surprise.

298
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,566
Were you surprised,
Telulah Farrow?

299
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,694
Did you jump back and go, "Whoa,
I am surprised at this quiz"?

300
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,905
While Mr. Somma's approach
to education

301
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,323
is somewhat aggressive,

302
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:23,076
the science department's
centuries‐old Mrs. Smith

303
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:26,746
has completely
lost her faculties.

304
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,373
She doesn't wear diapers
or anything

305
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,041
but she's always very tired

306
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,835
and always,
always angry about labs.

307
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,837
One day, she pointed to
the ceiling

308
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,881
and said to Hashtag...

309
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,259
You know where
you're going, mister?

310
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,261
And Hashtag goes...

311
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:44,597
In‐school suspension,
Mrs. Smith.

312
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,183
And she looked at him
kind of crazy‐eyed,

313
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,185
scoffed, and said...

314
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,478
No.

315
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,272
To the moon.

316
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,940
You're going to the moon.

317
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,566
Yes.

318
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:59,195
Though mildly confused
by Mrs. Smith's uncharacteristic

319
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:02,031
outburst, Hashtag
was totally excited,

320
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,700
until he realized in fact

321
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,201
he was not going to
the moon.

322
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,164
To this day, whenever
Mrs. Smith points her finger

323
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:13,084
for any given reason,
the entire class yells...

324
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,711
(all)
To the moon!

325
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:18,006
(texting)

326
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:19,507
Hey.

327
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,718
I have three hours
and 12 minutes to upload,

328
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,928
edit and hand in my trailer.

329
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:27,098
I think I got some
good stuff, though.

330
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:28,474
(cell phone alerting)

331
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,851
What?

332
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,978
I even shot Mrs. Smith
and Hashtag.

333
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,271
Yeah.

334
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:34,647
Claire Bovary
is moving here.

335
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,274
What?

336
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:37,608
The Claire Bovary?

337
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,110
(cell phone alerting)

338
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,279
I feel like that sucks.

339
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,242
Ugh.

340
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,785
Doesn't your mom get
that I don't like mayo?

341
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,622
I guess it's something
about her dad's job.

342
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,750
It seems odd the most popular
girl in our school

343
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,126
might actually
start going to our school.

344
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:56,461
Look at your phone.

345
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:58,546
I mean, everyone's
talking about it.

346
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,591
(texting, message alerts)

347
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,387
Why does everyone love her?

348
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:09,223
Literally no one here has ever
even met her in person.

349
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,102
Well, except Josh.

350
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,729
They so had sex.

351
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,524
Um, yeah, they met at camp
when he was like ten

352
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,942
and he hasn't seen her since.

353
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,570
She lives in like Florida
or something.

354
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,113
Who?
Claire?

355
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,073
He could've still did it.

356
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:28,493
He's barely
"pubertish" now.

357
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,203
Well, she's friends with
everyone in our school

358
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,038
because of him, so...

359
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,498

00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,737
Darvan, you're so cute.

542
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:22,406
(laughing)

543
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,659
I saved you, Telulah Farrow.

544
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,286
I'm your hero.

545
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,790
Gotta go find me a cape
now and a Batmobile.

546
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,042
Maybe a super‐sonic Dar‐car.

547
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,043
Yeah.

548
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:37,004
Or a Dar‐van.

549
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:40,674
(cackling)

550
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:44,136
You‐‐ you said, "Dar‐van."

551
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,222
You just might be funny.

552
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:49,517
(Ms.
Stacy) I thought I told you to get to class, Dar‐van.

553
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:51,685
Oh, oh...

554
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,437
What do we have here?

555
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,897
Hold on a minute.

556
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,901
Girl.

557
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:02,696
I believe those shorts
break school rules,

558
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:03,697
don't they?

559
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,324
Really?

560
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,284
I didn't think so.

561
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,536
(Jamie)
Charlie.

562
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:11,831
(Holly)
Oh, I'll hold those for you.

563
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,332
Let's see how
things measure up.

564
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,837
As suspected.

565
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:20,089
Clearly not regulation.

566
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,007
Your mom know
you're wearing this?

567
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,802
(with British accent) Actually, Ms.,
my mum bought me this.

568
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:27,096
I think it's quite nice.

569
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:29,932
Why would you insult
my mum like that?

570
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:32,142
What'd you say?

571
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:34,937
My mum.

572
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:36,063
Who do you think
you are, girl?

573
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,273
Kate Middleton?

574
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,024
Hmm.

575
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:42,278
Rather lovely,
yes, but, um...

576
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:43,779
I'm more of
a Pippa really.

577
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,906
Pippa, a Pippa?

578
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:48,784
How about ISS, Ms. Pippa?

579
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,786
Three days next week.

580
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,664
But right now...

581
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:55,040
it's school nurse for you.

582
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,753
Move it.
Keep going.

583
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:02,423
Insty.

584
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:03,716
(cell phone clicking)

585
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:12,016
What is wrong with you?

586
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:16,312
If you don't like
what you're wearing,

587
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:18,814
it will ruin your
entire day at school.

588
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,357
It's sexist and unfair.

589
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,568
The boys never get
harassed for what they wear.

590
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,862
<i>Hello, this is Mary's phone.</i>
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

591
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:26,614
(cell phone beeping)
Mom, where are you?

592
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:30,117
This has been
the worst day of my life.

593
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,912
And it's Alex's birthday.

594
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:36,248
Just... I only have
47 minutes left.

595
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,250
Please pick up the phone.

596
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,712
(sighing)

597
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,804
I can't go to class like this.

598
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:54,266
It's not even ironic.

599
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:58,145
Maybe it is a little.

600
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,980
(sighing)

601
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,732
Geometry.

602
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:03,817
Blah‐blah‐blah.

603
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:06,904
In this equation,
we'll be using the new math.

604
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:08,530
Blah‐blah‐blah.

605
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:13,077
Now don't use
the old new math.

606
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:16,830
Use the new new math.

607
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,124
It's a little freaky
if you're not used to it.

608
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,002
A gifted Huntville art student
perfected eyeball stickers

609
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,462
about two years ago,

610
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,548
and she's been selling
them online ever since.

611
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:30,552
Mr. Goldfarb thinks his students
are really into geometry.

612
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,306
I guess it helps he's
practically blind.

613
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,557
Blah‐blah.

614
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:40,229
Okay, let me see what I have

615
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:41,730
and then I can put
something together

616
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,942
to just give him an idea.

617
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:46,610
(beeping, student yawning)

618
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,946
What?

619
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:50,322
No, no.

620
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,865
I‐‐ I don't understand.

621
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,035
(shrieking)

622
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,036
(gasping)

623
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,579
I'm so sorry, Math Wizard.

624
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,665
I just came to check
on my new partner.

625
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,458
Hey, Telulah Farrow.

626
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,127
Hey.

627
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:05,796
I was worried
about you.

628
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:06,880
(gasping)

629
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,132
That's just messed up.

630
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:09,466
Oh my God,
what are you wearing?

631
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,759
Insty.

632
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,760
(cell phone clicking)

633
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,761
(sighs)

634
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,431
(gasping)

635
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,604
(Darvan)
Telulah Farrow, wait.

636
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:23,647
Hey, hey, hey.

637
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:24,898
Telulah, what's up?

638
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,945
Telulah Farrow, we need to
discuss our project

639
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,280
so we can be famous.

640
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,782
I didn't make
the trailer, Darvan.

641
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,909
I spent too much time
on a birthday video

642
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:38,495
that got like 500,000 notes.

643
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:43,125
500,000.

644
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:46,253
But not one mention
from anyone in the band.

645
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,338
I'm just a stupid fan girl,

646
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,591
and I don't have a camera
and I don't have a trailer.

647
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:52,801
You better tell our film teacher
you need a new partner.

648
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:56,597
What‐‐ what trailer,
Telulah Farrow?

649
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:58,974
Don't we need to make
the movie first?

650
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,397
Bye.

651
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:10,903
I'm trying to be
very big to scare him

652
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,654
but I think he likes me now.

653
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:15,491
Hashtag, duh.

654
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:20,287

Where were you?

680
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:03,599
It was the worst
day of my life.

681
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:05,225
What‐‐ what happened?

682
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,476
What's wrong?

683
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,981
(Mary)
Hey, honey...

684
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:12,441
why don't you go hang out
with your friends

685
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,109
instead of staring
at that computer.

686
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,110
(sighing)

687
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,612
Because I hate
my friends.

688
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:18,113
You love your friends.

689
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,865
They suck,
I wanna move.

690
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:20,866
Oh yeah.

691
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,242
Where?

692
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,911
London.
London?

693
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:24,912
(cell phone clicking)

694
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:26,163
What are you doing?

695
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,708
(cell phone clicking)

696
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,793
Mom, why do you have
so much makeup on?

697
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,045
Oh, do you like it?

698
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,296
I had it
professionally done.

699
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:35,923
You don't know anybody
in London.

700
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:37,341
Some of my best friends
are in London.

701
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:39,217
They talk just like me.

702
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,553
What...

703
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,972
Is that why you couldn't pick me
up from school today?

704
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,475
You had to have someone
do your makeup?

705
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,894
Oh, you try to talk
like them.

706
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:49,895
No.

707
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:51,355
On Cartwhl.

708
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:53,023
I'm not even going to
begin to explain it.

709
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:55,359
We have similar blogs,
similar interests.

710
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,194
We like the same bands.

711
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:58,987
Well, I'm getting
a Facebook.

712
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,367
I don't know how
to respond to that.

713
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:06,244
Are you trying to be
the last person on earth?

714
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,872
I guess I'm feeling...

715
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,540
Yeah, I'm feeling a little
left out of things.

716
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:14,252
Do you think I should get
a professional picture taken?

717
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,129
No, we make fun of people
who do that.

718
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,841
Why?

719
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,635
(cell phone clicking)

720
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:24,596
Mom, there's an art to taking
a selfie and this is not it.

721
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,265
So cute in that.

722
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,684
Aw.

723
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:30,936
Um, I forgot that there was
somebody who called

724
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:32,729
who wanted your email address.

725
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,773
I don't know anyone
who emails.

726
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,233
Paul, your film teacher.

727
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:37,943
And I tried to find it
but I couldn't‐‐

728
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,945
I just didn't remember
the secret password

729
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:41,196
and your dad
is still on the plane.

730
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,781
Well, Dad's
pretty predictable.

731
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,616
Oh, yeah, here it is.

732
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,410
He just wants to meet before
school on Monday,

733
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,537
so that's fine.

734
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:49,538
Yeah.

735
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:50,789
Okay.

736
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,336
I bet I could guess
the password.

737
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,587
Let me see.

738
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:00,298
Let me see.

739
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:07,556
Yup, that's it.

740
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:09,266
It's your birthday.

741
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:10,308
There you go.

742
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,601
Oh, it's my birthday.
Yup.

743
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,603
That's smart.
Yeah.

744
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:14,855
Thank you.
Mm‐hmm.

745
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,109
Don't get mad at me.

746
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:20,027
Joey?!

747
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:22,320
You hardly even use it.

748
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,530
You have your
phone, Telulah.

749
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,450
Look, Joey,
this is very personal.

750
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:29,911
Each song on here says something
about each year of my life.

751
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:32,998
I love this iPod.

752
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,082
It's...

753
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,459
But you said you
hate everything.

754
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:36,960
Almost everything.

755
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,878
Do you hate Jamie?

756
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:38,879
Yes.

757
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:41,840
Do you hate...

758
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,841
Do you hate these?

759
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:43,842
Yes.

760
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,802
Do you hate... this dog?

761
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,929
Yes.

762
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,973
Do you hate...

763
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,266
this backpack?
Yes.

764
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,310
Do you hate this pen?
Yes.

765
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:58,356
Do you hate this brush?
Yes.

766
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:03,403
Do you hate your room?
Yeah.

767
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:04,654
Do you hate me?

768
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:12,120
Yes, I hate you so much

769
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,623
that I'm going to
give you Flissac.

770
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:16,124
But you must take
very good care of him, okay?

771
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,376
Okay.

772
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:19,628
Wait a second.

773
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:23,673
(water sloshing)

774
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:28,845
Here.

775
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:31,973
But, Joey,
this is Mermaid Lady.

776
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,475
Uh‐huh.

777
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:35,644
She has boobies.

778
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:37,395
I think I broke
your camera.

779
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:38,438
I'm sorry.

780
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,982
Do you want Flissac back?

781
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,526
No.

782
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:44,319
No, I think it
was the milk.

783
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,989
(birds chirping)

784
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,742
I heard kids are putting
poop on the computer now.

785
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,829
Just taking pictures
of it, posting it.

786
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:55,372
You're always texting
on the toilet.

787
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:56,540
Maybe it's some kind
of contest of something‐‐

788
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,833
What?

789
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,085
(sighing)

790
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:01,878
I said it's a new day, Lu.

791
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,421
It's a new day.

792
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:07,342
And don't worry, honey, Paul
thinks very highly of you.

793
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:10,512
And who the heck

794
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:12,722
is that?

795
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,224
What?

796
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:17,269
I didn't know Mr. Somma
teaches morning driver's ed.

797
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:23,942
You may start the vehicle.

798
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,987
(engine revving)

799
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,867
It's okay, Kim.
Take a deep breath.

800
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,246
(chuckling)

801
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:37,247
Mom?!

802
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:39,207
Now put on your blinker...

803
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,376
and move away
from the curb.

804
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:42,502
Don't get so close.

805
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:43,545
I'm serious.

806
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:44,796
Oh, come on, Lu, come on.

807
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:48,008
Why can't I just have
a normal mom?

808
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:49,509
All right.

809
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,011
Just messing with
the driver's ed. student.

810
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:52,262
She doesn't even see me.

811
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,807
(shifting)

812
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:56,808
(loud thud, tires screeching)

813
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,143
Did I kill something?

814
00:32:58,143 --> 00:32:59,895
Oh...

815
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:01,730
Mom.

816
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:02,898
What?

817
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:03,982
You didn't check
your mirror.

818
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,192
You have a car
right behind you.

819
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:06,443
Bam‐‐
like that‐‐

820
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:07,694
we're broadsided.

821
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,489
I wanna get out.

822
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,742
I hate driving.
I wanna get out!

823
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:16,578
(Paul) ...the rules,
she did not

824
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:18,079
abide by the rules.

825
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,623
(Darvan) I understand,
I understand all of that

826
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:21,291
but it's just‐‐ it's just‐‐

827
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:22,834
Look at this, man.

828
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,336
Just look.

829
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:25,378
Come on.

830
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,631
She went through
all this work.

831
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:29,507
I heard about the whole
trailer situation.

832
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,968
It's just not fair,
Mr. Scorsese.

833
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,179
I made it very clear
when it was due.

834
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:38,016
All right, but‐‐ but Telulah
Farrow is so talented.

835
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,476
She's your best student.

836
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:40,477
Look what she can do.

837
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:41,478
Look.

838
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:42,646
Look, look, look.

839
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:44,064
I don't even
like this music

840
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:45,065
and she got all these kids

841
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:46,066
listening to it.

842
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:48,985
I appreciate you
coming in.

843
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,278
Thank you.

844
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:07,754
Oh, hi, Telulah.

845
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,047
(gasping)

846
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,383
Thanks for
coming in early.

847
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:14,427
I've got a big
problem here.

848
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:15,679
Can't you get down?

849
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,141
Darvan.

850
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,893
I gotta say, he's a very
creative kid,

851
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:22,936
and so are you.

852
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:24,062
Your video‐‐ who is it?

853
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,564
All Time Low?

854
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,692
It's extremely well done,

855
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:31,569
and I've decided to accept it
as your trailer.

856
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:34,114
But with one condition.

857
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:36,992
I would like <i>you</i> to film

858
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:39,286
the upcoming
Spring Talent Fest

859
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:40,620
for the school's website.

860
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:44,249
Really?

861
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,669
Thank you, Paul,
thank you so much.

862
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:50,088
Um... yeah.

863
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:53,800
That's what I wanted to do
that night anyway.

864
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,385
I mean, if someone asked me
what I wanted to do

865
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:56,720
the night of the
Spring Talent Fest,

866
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,887
I would say,
"Film it."

867
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,180
Obviously.

868
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,474
Well, you can thank
your partner for that.

869
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:02,726
Now there's something else
I wanna tell you.

870
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:04,686
You of course know
who Tina Fey is...

871
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:09,357
You mean Ms. Norbury?

872
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:12,736
Of course, I mean, the first
female head writer of "SNL."

873
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:14,529
I respect her work so much.

874
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,698
Well, there's a pretty good
chance she's gonna be judging

875
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:18,992
the film fest in June.

876
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:20,660
(gasping)

877
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,704
Oh my God!
I know.

878
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:25,665
So you're gonna have to
bring your best.

879
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,083
And this is important
to you, Telulah,

880
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,544
but it's also important to me
and Huntville High

881
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,212
and this video program.

882
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,548
Oh my God,
I am throwing up.

883
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:34,883
Are you okay?

884
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:36,134
Yeah.

885
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,512
All right, apparently
she's very interested

886
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:40,805
in emerging talent,

887
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,808
and especially emerging
female talent.

888
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,393
That's you.

889
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:46,853
(both chuckling)

890
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:49,105
And listen, hey, even if it
doesn't work out with her,

891
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,523
don't worry.

892
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:51,775
I do know people.

893
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:57,405
God, has no one
IMDB‐ed me?!

894
00:35:57,405 --> 00:36:00,033
Really, I've been involved
in over 13 films.

895
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:02,035
14‐‐ I'm an EP
on your film too.

896
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:03,286
That's 14.

897
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,123
So great.

898
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,210
(man on PA)
<i>Good morning.</i>

899
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,962
<i>The Procrastinators Club</i>
<i>meeting scheduled for today</i>

900
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:16,007
<i>has been postponed 'til</i>
<i>Thursday at 2:30.</i>

901
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,759
(Holly)
I wonder what it's like

902
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:21,721
to be a boy who
gets to be with me?

903
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:24,265
(Kim)
I wonder if I'm still growing.

904
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:28,353
(Holly) lTelulah is totally <i>not</i> a virgin.

905
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:32,399
(Telulah) Hey, everyone,
did you see Holly's hickey?

906
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:34,025
(scoffing)

907
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,403
(boy)
My hair looks so fresh today.

908
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:39,030
It should be illegal.

909
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,242
(Riley)
Maybe Boba Fett <i>is</i> alive!

910
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:46,705
(Darvan)
Yo.

911
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:49,666
(Kim) I want Mr.
Somma to reprimand me.

912
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,885
Hey, Telulah, um,
I wanted to make sure

913
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,470
everything was okay.

914
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,889
You know, the other day,
that was insane.

915
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,766
Yeah.

916
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:08,810
Oh, nice, milky
white legs, Telulah.

917
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,855
I literally thought you were
wearing white leggings.

918
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:14,524
She's British, Holly.

919
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:16,276
Not everyone
is perpetually tan.

920
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:19,070
Well, maybe she's like afraid of
the sun or something.

921
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,697
Yeah, like a vampire.

922
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:23,074
♪♪

923
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,369
Wait, what is that?

924
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:29,873
(girl) Whoa,
I'm like drawn to it.

925
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:32,250
It's so beautiful
and bright.

926
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,209
Hmm.

927
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,213
(gasping)

928
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,590
(Holly)
Oh my God!

929
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,966
It's Claire Bovary!

930
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,176
You guys, it's‐‐

931
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:43,386
Everyone, Claire Bovary
has arrived!

932
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,472
(girl)
Wow, she's beautiful.

933
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:46,473
(girl 2)
Oh my God.

934
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:47,515
(Holly)
Loser Telulah.

935
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,768
I think I'm gonna go now.

936
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:52,645
My milky white legs
are taking me this way.

937
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:55,315
And she's speaking
fluent French.

938
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:56,608
She's so smart.

939
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,859
I can't.
Amazing.

940
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:04,324
Did someone just
mention Telulah?

941
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:05,784
Telulah Farrow?

942
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:06,785
I've been wanting to meet her.

943
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:08,077
Ew.
Why?

944
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,078
No.

945
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:11,247
(cell phone clicking)

946
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,749
(typing)

947
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:17,170
Mom, I need a new
camera for school.

948
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,630
Uh‐huh.

949
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,714
(cell phone clicking)

950
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,966
It's for a really
big project.

951
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,886
Could mean
my future in film.

952
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:26,262
Terrible.

953
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,680
Remember that festival
I was telling you about.

954
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,057
Well, if I'm chosen,

955
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:32,018
my work will be seen
by very important people.

956
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,853
Plus, my teacher asked me to
film the talent fest

957
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,189
which is, you know,
also a really big deal.

958
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:38,441
So...

959
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,026
(sighing)

960
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:42,028
Could put it on my
college résumé.

961
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:44,113
Well, can't you use
your phone for that?

962
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,448
No.

963
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,826
Honey, that's a very
expensive camera.

964
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:50,370
Meanwhile, look at this,
look at this... Can't use my phone.

965
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:51,371
Do I really look
like that?

966
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:52,997
I look like a man.

967
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,124
My face is shape shifting
or something like that.

968
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,626
Hey, kid.

969
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:58,878
Has my face changed
since I've met you?

970
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,088
From the time when
I was one day old?

971
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:01,172
Yeah.

972
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,215
Yeah.

973
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:03,216
When's Dad coming home?

974
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:04,425
In about a week.

975
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,677
You can call him, Joey.

976
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:11,057
Hey, I have an idea.

977
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:13,184
Toss on an old sweater,
some boot‐cut jeans,

978
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,519
I'll take your photo, okay,

979
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:17,063
with my new camera,
and you'll look so good

980
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,231
I'll barely have
to Photoshop you.

981
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:19,899
It's perfect.

982
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:23,194
So should it look like
I take my own picture or not?

983
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,905
(Mary) Telulah,
you better not be on Cartwhl again.

984
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:31,578
And did you do your
SAT question of the day?

985
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:33,496
I'm so getting
a tattoo.

986
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:36,332
Not while you live
here you're not.

987
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:37,542
Just listen.

988
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:40,545
It would be so small.

989
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:43,047
Just lyrics in Alex's
own handwriting.

990
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:47,510
"You're safe from
the weight of the world."

991
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,554
It's so cute.

992
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:51,723
No, there's no way.

993
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,308
You're underage,
you need my permission.

994
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:55,935
A tattoo is a permanent reminder
of a temporary feeling.

995
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:58,229
Mom, all feelings
are temporary

996
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,773
unless you
remember them.

997
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,275
So if I get one,
I'll remember.

998
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:05,862
No.

999
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:07,989
You only remember
that you had a moment

1000
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:10,783
you don't actually feel
the feeling again.

1001
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,243
Plus, it's low class.

1002
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,870
According to you
everyone is low class

1003
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,788
because all my friends
are getting tattoos.

1004
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:18,458
I don't care what all your
friends are doing.

1005
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,335
No.

1006
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:21,502
You have beautiful skin.

1007
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,922
Don't ruin it.

1008
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:26,883
I can't wait to get out of this
house and do whatever I want.

1009
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:28,927
And then she's like,
"But you have beautiful skin.

1010
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:29,969
You don't wanna ruin it."

1011
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,220
And then I'm just like,

1012
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,681
"Mom, I'm not
Emma Stone white.

1013
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:34,682
If I was, I wouldn't even be
doing this."

1014
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,225
Yeah, you're not.

1015
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:38,561
All right, first apply this
cream to your hands and feet,

1016
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,188
knuckles, fingers,

1017
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:41,773
toenails, fingernails,
and under your fingernails

1018
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,733
'cause those areas can
get like four times darker

1019
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:44,901
and this cream will
help protect them.

1020
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:46,152
Put on this hairnet.

1021
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,446
Here's a towel.

1022
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,822
Step into the booth, put your
left foot on the letter "C"

1023
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,741
and your right foot
on the letter "A."

1024
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:53,952
And when the spray starts,
don't scrunch up your face

1025
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,036
and don't breathe it in.

1026
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:56,287
Just do like this.

1027
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:00,875
Keep your hands at your sides
with your palms facing in.

1028
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,502
When the spray stops,

1029
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:04,003
turn quarter of the way
around until finished.

1030
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,089
There's a recorded message
to walk you through.

1031
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:08,216
Your tan will darken
over the next few hours.

1032
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:09,717
Are you ready?

1033
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:13,846
Jamie, don't leave me.

1034
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:21,854
(indistinct chatter)

1035
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,439
Oh, hi, Petey.

1036
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:24,899
Are you ready for me?

1037
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,401
Oh, it'll just be a few more
minutes, Holly.

1038
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:27,652
Someone's in there.

1039
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:29,988
But this is my
usual time, Petey.

1040
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:32,073
Reserved just for me.

1041
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:33,324
Remember?

1042
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:36,786
Telulah Farrow?!

1043
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:43,584
Wait, so what's going‐‐
what's happening now?

1044
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:44,919
I don't know,
I'm really confused.

1045
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,754
You're supposed to listen
to the robot lady.

1046
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:47,547
Well, there's no
voice coming‐‐

1047
00:41:47,547 --> 00:41:49,007
Well, you're closer to her.

1048
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:50,091
Hold‐‐
Okay, here we go.

1049
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:52,010
Okay.
All right, all right.

1050
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,178
It's going really fast.
Yeah, that's the machine‐‐ duh!

1051
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,055
No, but it's too fast.
Okay, well, how do you know?

1052
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:58,057
Are you an expert
on these things?

1053
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,350
I looked it up!
(robotic voice) <i>Your spray tan is complete.</i>

1054
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,185
Wait, it's going‐‐
did you change‐‐

1055
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,562
Yes, I changed it‐‐
When did you change it?

1056
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:03,938
Did you press a button?

1057
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,481
Telulah, I didn't press
any buttons, okay?

1058
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,108
You're supposed to be
pressing all the buttons.

1059
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:08,276
I didn't touch anything.

1060
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:09,986
Oh, it's in my eyes, Jamie.

1061
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:12,155
Jamie, this is so bad‐‐ Okay,
don't scrunch up your face.

1062
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:13,656
You're scrunching up your face,
you don't scrunch up‐‐

1063
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,908
Okay, it's gonna be
uneven if you do that!

1064
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:18,494
What are you doing?
I'm trying to defend it!

1065
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:20,121
I'm blocking‐‐

1066
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:21,664
You're gonna get
an uneven spray tan

1067
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:22,915
and that will look
worse than this.

1068
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,792
But I don't want
a spray tan anymore!

1069
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:27,587
(cell phone alerting)
Stop texting me.

1070
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:29,297
(cell phone ringing)
God.

1071
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:30,715
I'm on my way.

1072
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:31,758
I have everything.

1073
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:33,718
Calm down, I just...

1074
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:35,803
Oh,

1075
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:36,971
Ah, shoot.

1076
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,723
Listen, honey, I'll be home
in five minutes.

1077
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:41,642
Everything is gonna be okay.

1078
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,728
God.

1079
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:46,606
Oh...

1080
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:48,608
There's something about
life handing you lemons.

1081
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:53,613
Well, I can't believe
you just said that.

1082
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:54,614
But thanks.

1083
00:42:57,867 --> 00:42:59,660
Do I know you?

1084
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,537
Yeah.

1085
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,831
Mary, it's Mike Bovary
from Burner High School,

1086
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:04,832
class of '82.

1087
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,626
Oh, Mike.
Yeah.

1088
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:08,419
(chuckling) Hi.

1089
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,879
Yeah, I mean, I thought
that was you in there,

1090
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:10,880
but I wasn't‐‐ I wasn't sure.

1091
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,298
Oh.

1092
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,717
Yeah, you‐‐
you look great.

1093
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:15,760
Really?

1094
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,261
Really?
Yeah.

1095
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:20,765
Oh, well, lemons are
actually an excellent source

1096
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:22,850
of bioflavonoids
and nutrients

1097
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,561
and, well...

1098
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:26,562
thank you very much.

1099
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,773
Yeah.

1100
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:30,525
(crickets chirping)

1101
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:32,527
Well, I'll be damned.

1102
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:34,612
Darned.

1103
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:37,615
Who puts a picture
of his dog on there?

1104
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:42,620
He's cute.

1105
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,621
Real cute.

1106
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:46,833
Oh, hey, ladies.

1107
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:48,376
You look hot, Mrs. Farrow.

1108
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:49,502
I do?

1109
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:50,670
(girl)
I love your makeup.

1110
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,421
Okay, all right.

1111
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:53,756
Well, hey, how's
it going up there.

1112
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:55,842
Telulah said you
had loofahs, right?

1113
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:56,843
Yeah, in the kitchen.

1114
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:57,844
Thanks.
Got it.

1115
00:43:57,844 --> 00:43:59,804
Thanks.

1116
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:00,888
Hey, Lu, I'm leaving.

1117
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,349
I'm gonna go to the,
uh‐‐ that concert‐‐

1118
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,768
the new concert place,
The Space,

1119
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:08,729
and your brother's downstairs
so be sure to check on him.

1120
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,523
Lu!

1121
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:16,529
Okay, here I go.

1122
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:18,614
I‐‐ I'm leaving.

1123
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,324
Gonna have a great time.

1124
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,451
Whoo!

1125
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:24,287
Yay, me!
Bye!

1126
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:30,459
So that girl Claire,
she's in my science class

1127
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:32,336
and she's like,
"I love your blog.

1128
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,797
I've been following you on
Cartwhl for like two years."

1129
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:36,799
Yeah, Claire's
pretty chill.

1130
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,926
Well, yeah, she's‐‐

1131
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:40,845
she's probably
not that chill.

1132
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:43,890
Just everyone saying she's chill
makes her like a bit chiller

1133
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:46,350
than she actually is.

1134
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,935
I'm not saying
I'm completely chill

1135
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:51,480
but I am considerably chill,
so I am a pretty good judge.

1136
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,148
Mm‐hmm.

1137
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,902
(laughing)

1138
00:44:57,987 --> 00:44:59,822
I... I...

1139
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,949
I should not have
drank that much wine.

1140
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,159
I'm sorry if I said too much.

1141
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:04,202
Oh no worries, no worries.

1142
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:05,661
The band drowned you
out a bit.

1143
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:06,829
What?

1144
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:08,915
That's not funny,
that's not funny.

1145
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:10,833
So how...

1146
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,919
Mike, I don't remember the last
time I danced like that.

1147
00:45:12,919 --> 00:45:15,004
Oh, I was worried that's
how you normally dance.

1148
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:16,339
I'm sorry.

1149
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:17,882
You keep setting me up,
I can't help myself.

1150
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:18,925
I'm glad you
had a good time.

1151
00:45:18,925 --> 00:45:20,051
That's not funny at all.

1152
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:21,177
I know,
it's so stupid.

1153
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:22,845
It couldn't have
been more stupid.

1154
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:25,765
That's 'cause I'm an idiot,
you'll get to know that.

1155
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:27,058
(door closing)

1156
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:36,108
Did you know the Equal Rights
Amendment never became one?

1157
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:37,360
It was never ratified.

1158
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,737
It's not in the US Constitution.

1159
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,864
It says right here that women
still aren't covered

1160
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:43,908
by our constitution
the way men are.

1161
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:47,995
Don't you think that sucks?

1162
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:50,748
Not if we can have guns.

1163
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:51,791
(Anna)
I can burn my bra.

1164
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:54,001
It's kind of big.

1165
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,003
Telulah, aren't you supposed to
be looking for movie ideas?

1166
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,880
I want it to be the best
film I've ever made

1167
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,007
and I think
that's paralyzing me.

1168
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:02,760
(sighing)

1169
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,929
I just wish
I could meet them.

1170
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:07,974
Just Alex.

1171
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:10,309
And Jack and Rian and Zack.

1172
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:12,853
Then maybe my project
wouldn't suck so much

1173
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:15,690
and I could actually get
into a decent film school

1174
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:17,984
and I wouldn't have to live
here the rest of my life.

1175
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:19,068
My guidance counselor
tells me that there is

1176
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:21,112
a college for everyone.

1177
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:25,366
Like what would you
even say to them?

1178
00:46:25,366 --> 00:46:26,367
All Time Low?

1179
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:28,077
Yeah.

1180
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:30,288
Something really witty
and intelligent.

1181
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:32,957
Something that doesn't
imply I'm a scary fan girl

1182
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:37,044
but gives off more of like an
"Oh, oh, yeah, you're that band.

1183
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,170
"I've heard a few
of your songs before.

1184
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,964
"You're not that impressive.

1185
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:42,591
"So try to impress me.

1186
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:46,262
Because I winged my eyeliner
for this," kind of feel.

1187
00:46:46,262 --> 00:46:49,223
Well, I heard Claire's dad's
in the music business.

1188
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,599
Maybe Claire can help you.

1189
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:52,018
Yeah, she's so amazing.

1190
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:53,894
I was talking to her
third period about

1191
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:55,146
the shampoo she uses.

1192
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:58,107
Her hair is so
freaking smooth

1193
00:46:58,107 --> 00:47:00,318
yet somehow also bouncy.

1194
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:02,028
No wonder
Josh loves her.

1195
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:05,031
I don't love Josh anymore.

1196
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:08,326
I only like
a percentage of him.

1197
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:10,411
I like the left side
of his face.

1198
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:17,877
Well, it's still worth a shot.

1199
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:26,927
What was your
very first album?

1200
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:28,888
Do you remember?

1201
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:30,056
Yup.

1202
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:31,640
Yeah, Santana, "Abraxas."

1203
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:34,810
Whoa.

1204
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,020
I'm not kidding.

1205
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,230
My‐‐ my dad worked
at a record company

1206
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:41,108
and he'd bring home
all these albums

1207
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,109
and that was my first.

1208
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:44,987
Yeah.

1209
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:46,155
And then my
brothers took it

1210
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:48,032
'cause it had boobies
on the cover.

1211
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:51,118
(chuckling)

1212
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:53,704
I woulda had you
pegged for Cat Stevens.

1213
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:56,624
Oh, well...

1214
00:47:56,624 --> 00:47:58,000
Yeah, he's messed up now‐‐
no thank you.

1215
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,126
He's messed up now, though.

1216
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:07,134
Ew!

1217
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,260
Why didn't you
shave your knee?

1218
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,888
It's my filter.

1219
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,014
If a guy only notices

1220
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:13,766
that one thing about me
then he's an.

1221
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:16,060
Do the feminists know
about filters?

1222
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,646
Yeah, think so.

1223
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:24,151
Uh, Darvan never
answers my text.

1224
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,695
I don't have a partner,
I don't have a camera

1225
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:27,863
and I'm orange.

1226
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,073
I'm never going back
to school.

1227
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:31,909
Okay.

1228
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,994
Five minutes and you
have to soak again

1229
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,163
and loofah, Telulah.

1230
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:38,749
I think you're trying way to
hard to defend pop punk.

1231
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:47,174
Oh.

1232
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,176
Are you gonna kiss me
or something?

1233
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:51,470
What?

1234
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,180
Oh...
God, no, no.

1235
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,766
"Oh God, no."

1236
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,060
"Oh God, no."

1237
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,646
What about the jeans
and everything?!

1238
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:01,730
I didn't mean it
like that.

1239
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:02,982
Oh...

1240
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:05,901
I mean, I was just gonna
say that, uh...

1241
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:09,113
there can come
a time when, you know,

1242
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:11,073
he never comes back.

1243
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:13,659
I mean, even from Canada.

1244
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:15,828
What?

1245
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:16,912
What, who said that?

1246
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,330
Who told you that?

1247
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,249
My wife.

1248
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:22,918
My wife loved
classic rock.

1249
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:28,257
Always hanging backstage
with the bands.

1250
00:49:28,257 --> 00:49:31,218
You know, then one day,
out of nowhere,

1251
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:34,221
she just takes off
with a country music star.

1252
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,222
That's insulting.

1253
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:36,849
Oh.

1254
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:38,267
Yeah, that's insulting.

1255
00:49:38,267 --> 00:49:42,021
That's... that's insulting.

1256
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:44,565
She's been in Nashville...

1257
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:46,275
for two years.

1258
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:47,276
Oh.

1259
00:49:47,276 --> 00:49:48,694
Insult on top of insult.

1260
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:51,071
Yeah.

1261
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:54,074
Now, the move here has been
really good for Claire.

1262
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:56,076
Still, it's really hard,
you know.

1263
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:59,246
I mean, I'd like to
see her get angry.

1264
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:02,875
I really would.
Yeah.

1265
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:04,627
But she just wants
everybody to be happy.

1266
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,547
So I'm trying.

1267
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,090
I mean, you know,
I'm really‐‐

1268
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,550
I'm really trying.

1269
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:12,718
Yeah, that's
all kids want.

1270
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:13,719
They just want everybody
to be happy.

1271
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:15,095
I know.

1272
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:20,476
Have you ever heard of that band
called All Time Low?

1273
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:26,649
You ever gonna take
that off?

1274
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:28,651
I'm getting ready
for my oral report.

1275
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:31,570
Dad says if I practice
a lot I won't be nervous.

1276
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:33,030
He's gonna help me
when he gets home.

1277
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:37,785
My friend Steve's parents
are getting a divorce

1278
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:39,119
and his dad got another house

1279
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,914
and Steve's gonna have
a room with an Xbox in it

1280
00:50:41,914 --> 00:50:44,959
so he'll have two Xboxes.

1281
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:46,627
Really.

1282
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:49,046
Anna's parents are getting
divorced too.

1283
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:50,297
Mom's on a date.

1284
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:52,383
Somebody took her
in a big car.

1285
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:57,137
Come here, Ben Franklin.

1286
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:59,181
Mom doesn't go on dates

1287
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:02,560
because she's married to Dad.

1288
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,728
She's at a show with some
friends, silly.

1289
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:06,522
(video game gunfire)

1290
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:09,358
She wouldn't even
know how to date.

1291
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:13,529
All I know is that there's
a man's face on my forearm.

1292
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:14,905
(woman)
<i>What? What do you mean?</i>

1293
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:15,906
<i>Whose face?</i>

1294
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,241
I don't know.

1295
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:19,827
I mean, possibly
that guy but...

1296
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:20,828
(gasping)

1297
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:22,788
Oh my God.
<i>What?</i>

1298
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:25,708
Diane, Cat Steven's
face is on my forearm.

1299
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:27,334
<i>Oh God,</i>
<i>it's gotta be henna.</i>

1300
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:28,335
<i>Is it henna?</i>

1301
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:29,336
<i>Holy Mary.</i>

1302
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:30,546
Whoa.

1303
00:51:30,546 --> 00:51:32,256
Adult telephone
conversation.

1304
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:33,173
Hold on, honey.
<i>What?</i>

1305
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,174
Hi.

1306
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:36,135
Hi.

1307
00:51:36,135 --> 00:51:37,177
What's going on?

1308
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:39,305
You still orange?
No.

1309
00:51:39,305 --> 00:51:40,556
<i>What the hell did you do?</i>

1310
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:42,016
Well, I'm pretty
sure we were‐‐

1311
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:45,227
oh, ow‐‐ in Tommy Tattoos
around 2:00 last night.

1312
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,314
Oh my God!

1313
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:49,815
Why do I keep rhyming?!

1314
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:51,609
Calm down.

1315
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:53,986
Don't tell me
to calm down, Lu.

1316
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:55,487
I'm the mother.

1317
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:56,822
Wait, you were at
Tommy Tattoos last night?

1318
00:51:56,822 --> 00:52:00,743
Let me see, oh my‐‐

1319
00:52:00,743 --> 00:52:04,538
Why is Grandma
on your arm?

1320
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,665
Grandma.

1321
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,626
You will never be
my first tattoo, Mom.

1322
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:09,585

1323
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:10,586
Uh...

1324
00:52:10,586 --> 00:52:11,587
Ow!

1325
00:52:11,587 --> 00:52:13,505
No, Diane!

1326
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:16,091
I think Jamie's sister is
driving us to school early.

1327
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,301
Okay.

1328
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:19,678
And Joey's still sleeping.

1329
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:20,929
Sounds good.

1330
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:22,264

<i>Good freaking parenting.</i>

1331

the very last song
you here is?

1335
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:34,234
No, Johnson,
I never wonder that.

Give me three
light and sweet.

1340
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:40,824
You mean if I listened
to music in the car

1341
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,576
and got into
a fiery crash?

1342
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:44,119
Yes, yes, like that!

1343
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,996
Good morning,

God's been waiting

No, man, no.

just so happens

1355
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:10,312
to be the very same song

1356
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:11,855
as the very first song
you ever hear

1357
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:12,981
in your life on this earth?

1358
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,650
Why do you
think like this?

1359
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:16,652
All I'm saying is
it could happen!

1360
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:18,904
And I could marry your mother
and you could be my son

1361
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:21,198
and Telulah could
be your babysitter.

1362
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:22,950
And I could use the work,

1363
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:25,703
but only if he was a little boy,
a much smaller Johnson.

1364
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:27,913
(chuckling)

1365
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:30,290

1367
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:33,711
A little mini pee‐pee.

No, stop.

00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,257
Stop it.

1372
00:53:39,842 --> 00:53:41,760
Oh, you must be Alex.

00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:46,056
Telulah, it's on me for
making me laugh so hard.

1375
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,891
Telulah, it's a sweet name.

1376
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,478
Throw up.

1377
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,897
Anything could happen.

1378
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:58,861
I'm throwing up!
Ah, I'm throwing up!

1379
00:53:58,861 --> 00:54:01,029
Don't let her in
if she's throwing up.

1380
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:02,781
Shut up, it's something
she says lot.

1381
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:04,742
You shut up.
You shut up!

1382
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:09,079
Oh.

1383
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,122
What happened?

1384
00:54:10,122 --> 00:54:11,415
It was him,
it was him.

1385
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:12,958
Who?

1386
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:15,294
He was standing
right behind me

1387
00:54:15,294 --> 00:54:16,378
and I didn't know.

1388
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:17,838
How could that be?

1389
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:20,883
And, I‐I‐‐ Thomas was there
and Johnson was there

1390
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:22,760
and Arabica beans.
(horn honking)

1391
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:26,013
Oh, my God, shut up, sister.
You're scaring the old people!

1392
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:27,473
Open the door!

1393
00:54:27,473 --> 00:54:30,058
Do you really think
I wouldn't know Alex Gaskarth?

1394
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:32,478
I even know his mother's
maiden name!

1395
00:54:32,478 --> 00:54:34,104
I know all their
mother's maiden names.

1396
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:36,940
Okay, get in the car,
take a breath.

1397
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,985
Here you go, see,
we're gonna have coffee talk.

1398
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,570
All right.

1399
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:45,824
It was him.
It‐‐ it was him.

1400
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:47,367
It was‐‐
it was definitely him.

1401
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:50,329
If there was just
a photo of‐‐ of Jack

1402
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:52,664
and just a sliver
of Alex's elbow in there,

1403
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:55,042
I would definitely know
it was Alex's elbow!

1404
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:57,586
Well, that would be because
they're in the same band.

1405
00:54:57,586 --> 00:54:59,755
Hey, shut up!
You shut up.

1406
00:54:59,755 --> 00:55:02,925
He was so cute
with the little hoodie

1407
00:55:02,925 --> 00:55:04,843
and his bed head.

1408
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:07,888
I couldn't think.
I said, "Throw up."

1409
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:10,307
I don't‐‐ oh, God.

1410
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:13,060
I told him to throw up.

1411
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:15,687
What is that, like
a command or something?

1412
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:17,231
I just...

1413
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:19,107
Oh, God, I think
I'm really gonna be sick.

1414
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:21,068
Do you wanna know
what a command is?

1415
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:22,236
Shut up!

1416
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:23,237
You shut up!

1417
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:25,072
You shut up!

1418
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:26,615
I can't go to school.
I have to find him.

1419
00:55:26,615 --> 00:55:27,908
All right, dude, no.

1420
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:30,077
The dreaded Spring Talent Fest
is tonight.

1421
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:31,703
You haven't even
started making your film

1422
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:33,872
and it's due in like four days,
six hours, and 22 minutes.

1423
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:35,958
It‐‐ you made that up.

1424
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:38,210
Hello, Tina Fey?

1425
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:40,295
(sighing)

1426
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:42,047
Drink up.

1427
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:51,306
Use this to shoot
the Spring Talent Fest tonight.

1428
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:55,143
And then, you know, just hang
onto it for your final project.

1429
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:58,272
You should've told me
your camera was busted.

1430
00:55:58,272 --> 00:56:00,524
What have you been using?

1431
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:03,443
Well, Darvan and I have
been very hard at work,

1432
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:05,988
but I don't wanna
give away too much.

1433
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:07,531
All right.

1434
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:08,991
But, uh, no phones.

1435
00:56:08,991 --> 00:56:10,367
Yeah.
Okay.

1436
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:14,538
Thank you, Paul.
This is so nice, um...

1437
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:15,581
I'll do a good job.

1438
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:18,875
Yes, you will.
Thank you.

1439
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,252
(chuckling)

1440
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:30,220
You really must be
practicing a lot, Charlie.

1441
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,973
We've met only a few times
and I'd say you're ready.

1442
00:56:32,973 --> 00:56:35,559
Hmm, I'm really
nervous, Claire.

1443
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:36,643
I've never done this before.

1444
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:38,478
I'm so glad you
kept it a secret.

1445
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:42,399
Don't worry or you won't
enjoy it when it's happening.

1446
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,443
Just relax, Charlie.

1447
00:56:44,443 --> 00:56:46,153
Nothing could be
more romantic.

1448
00:56:47,988 --> 00:56:49,364
Karl's got swooshed!

1449
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:50,532
What?

1450
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:52,701
Wait, Scene Boy, come back!

1451
00:56:52,701 --> 00:56:54,453
Does Jamie know?

1452
00:56:57,539 --> 00:56:58,915

Telulah, wait up.
Um, how's it going?

1472
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:23,667
Did Jamie text you?

1473
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:26,128
(British accent) No worries, love,
Carlos is curiously well.

1474
00:58:26,128 --> 00:58:28,588
Just a small fracture,
a little shaken is all.

1475
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:29,631
Well, I'm happy for Jamie.

1476
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:31,675
It's really hard
to lose a pet.

1477
00:58:31,675 --> 00:58:34,803
So you're going to the Spring
Talent Fest tonight, right?

1478
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:38,056
Bollocks,
unfortunately.

1479
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:39,683
Cheers, Charles.

1480
00:58:39,683 --> 00:58:41,601
Oh, well...

1481
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:43,478
See you there.

1482
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:48,775
Yeah,
see you around, Charlie.

1483
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:50,652
Telulah.

1484
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:52,946
I'm so glad we're lab partners.

1485
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:54,322
Did I just see you
with Charlie?

1486
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:55,907
He's so nice.

1487
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:57,784
Hashtag...

1488
00:58:57,784 --> 00:59:00,954
what do you think would happen
to a can of shaving cream

1489
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:03,290
if you added
liquid nitrogen to it?

1490
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:05,208
Um...

1491
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:09,671
Should I just go
to the moon now?

1492
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:11,798
Yes. Claire?

1493
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:14,801
It would expand enough
to fill an entire school bus.

1494
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:16,887
No way, no,
that's not possible.

1495
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:17,929
Wanna bet?

1496
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:19,389
Thank you, Claire.

1497
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,349
I hope gets you all
a little excited

1498
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:24,227
about our next unit
featuring nitrogen.

1499
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:26,271
(mimicking explosion)

1500
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:28,815
Actually...

1501
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:30,859
the same result
can be achieved

1502
00:59:30,859 --> 00:59:32,277
using
a conventional freezer.

1503
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:35,197
You just have to freeze
the cans of shaving cream,

1504
00:59:35,197 --> 00:59:37,032
cut the frozen blocks
out of the cans,

1505
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:38,283
and then place them
in a bus.

1506
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:40,952
Then walk away
and let them thaw.

1507
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:43,288
It'd be amazing to witness,
don't you think?

1508
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:47,209
(water bubbling)

1509
00:59:47,209 --> 00:59:49,669
I do a lot of
experimenting at home.

1510
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:52,214
I like, like, Bill Nye
the Science Guy.

1511
00:59:52,214 --> 00:59:55,759
Yeah, me, too.
That dude is dope.

1512
00:59:57,761 --> 01:00:02,724
Charlie has this friend, Josh,
who I think is really cute.

1513
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:06,812
Wait... wait, what?

1514
01:00:06,812 --> 01:00:08,313
You don't know Josh?

1515
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:11,274
I know, it's like crazy.
He looks so familiar to me.

1516
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:13,860
I mean, I'm friends
with him on Facebook,

1517
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,654
but I'm not <i>not</i> going
to friend someone

1518
01:00:15,654 --> 01:00:17,239
just because
I don't know them.

1519
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:18,698
That's just mean.

1520
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:22,244
Hey, you know
that girl Holly?

1521
01:00:22,244 --> 01:00:24,621
She said if she sees
me outside of Facebook,

1522
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:26,748
she's not my friend.

1523
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:31,878
That's ironic because she's on
Facebook all the time.

1524
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:34,506
Like she's 30
and at home with kids.

1525
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:40,637
Oh, Claire, don't be sad.
She's... just jealous.

1526
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:44,933
Oh, your‐‐ your goggles
are starting to fog up a bit.

1527
01:00:44,933 --> 01:00:47,185
And‐‐ and it's probably pretty
dangerous right now, right?

1528
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:49,563
I mean, I see that‐‐

1529
01:00:49,563 --> 01:00:51,690
Claire, there's
smoke everywhere.

1530
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:53,066
That's just‐‐ that's not...

1531
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:54,776
That's supposed to happen.

1532
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:57,153
That is...
supposed to happen.

1533
01:00:57,153 --> 01:01:00,824
(Mary) Telulah,
are you on Cartwhl again?

1534
01:01:00,824 --> 01:01:02,742
What?!

1535
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:06,621
No, I'm getting ready
for the Talent Fest.

1536
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:12,002
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, Ma!

1537
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:13,879
Warp Tour tickets.

1538
01:01:13,879 --> 01:01:15,797
Yeah, but did you do your
SAT question of the day?

1539
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:17,549

1540
01:01:17,549 --> 01:01:18,592

1542
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:21,761
Who are you sending nudes to?

1543
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:24,890
Oh, come on, honey,
nobody's ever gonna see this.

1544
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:27,684
Once it's out there,
it's out there!

1545
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:28,852
Gross.

1546
01:01:28,852 --> 01:01:31,897
I'm going back to my room
to literally throw up.

1547
01:01:31,897 --> 01:01:34,608
Okay.

1548
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:35,984
Can you drive me
to school, though?

1549
01:01:35,984 --> 01:01:37,652
Yeah, sure.

1550
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:41,072
(clicking)

1551
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:43,575
(sighing)

1552
01:01:46,912 --> 01:01:50,832
Yeah, so nothing on All Time Low
yet, but it was definitely Alex.

1553
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:53,293
Took me all day
to stop shaking.

1554
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:58,924
Hey, you should get
a balloon doggy for Hashtag.

1555
01:01:58,924 --> 01:02:01,843
Yeah, Hashtag...

1556
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:05,931
Oh, I'm losing it.

1557
01:02:05,931 --> 01:02:07,974
Maybe because
he saved your dog.

1558
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:09,559
Hashtag hero.

1559
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:10,810
He could be hot,
you know.

1560
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:11,853
Thank you.

1561
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:13,188
I gotta work on that.

1562
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:16,816

01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:16,639
(banging on door)

01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:18,600

Yo!

01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:28,193
Are you mad at me,
Telulah Farrow?

1644
01:06:28,193 --> 01:06:29,903
I couldn't just
blow off my new job.

1645
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:31,821
Ms. Stacy
helped me get it.

1646
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:35,491
I do think
that lady loves me.

1647
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:36,534
Nice hat.

1648
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:37,660
Oh, yeah.

1649
01:06:39,287 --> 01:06:41,247
How come you didn't
tell me?

1650
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:42,749
Hello?

1651
01:06:42,749 --> 01:06:44,042
Hi.

1652
01:06:44,042 --> 01:06:46,127
This is Darvan,
my‐‐ my film partner.

1653
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:47,462
Oh.
Project.

1654
01:06:47,462 --> 01:06:49,088
Yeah, nice to meet you.

1655
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:51,674
Thanks.
You look very familiar.

1656
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:52,800
What, really?

1657
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,135
Mm‐hmm.
Huh.

1658
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:58,640
Yeah, I guess, I wasn't
expecting someone so mature.

1659
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:01,643
Well, yeah...

1660
01:07:01,643 --> 01:07:05,146
She means you don't look
like a high school kid.

1661
01:07:05,146 --> 01:07:08,191
Oh, that's because
I'm in the 12th‐‐

1662
01:07:08,191 --> 01:07:10,193
12th grade, ma'am.

1663
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:12,237
Nice to meet you, too.

1664
01:07:12,237 --> 01:07:14,822
Uh, is your husband
in Canada?

1665
01:07:14,822 --> 01:07:16,241
Canada? Oh, no.

1666
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:18,159
No, my dad's
in California.

1667
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:20,161
Yeah.
(whispers) In California.

1668
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,294
Hey, listen to me.

1669
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:30,088
I know where
they're staying.

1670
01:07:30,088 --> 01:07:32,173
I know what room
they're staying in.

1671
01:07:32,173 --> 01:07:34,175
And I know how to get in
the room they're staying in

1672
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:36,302
at the place
where they staying.

1673
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:38,054
What are you saying?
What does that even mean?

1674
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:40,515
Shh‐shh‐shh‐shh.

1675
01:07:40,515 --> 01:07:42,100
I have a plan.

1676
01:07:44,519 --> 01:07:46,854
All right.
(chuckles)

1677
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:50,733
Yeah.
(laughing)

1678
01:07:52,652 --> 01:07:55,363
All right.

1679
01:07:55,363 --> 01:07:56,990
This is your big idea?

1680
01:07:56,990 --> 01:08:00,868
Yo, we can get to
their room from the roof.

1681
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:05,790
Ha‐ha.

1682
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:07,292
Yeah.

1683
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:15,633
Jamie, no!

1684
01:08:20,847 --> 01:08:22,807
(gasping)
(distant music playing, singing)

1685
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:25,226
Listen to
their beautiful,

1686
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:28,062
melodic,
underdeveloped voices.

1687
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:30,481
Like a girl's voice.

1688
01:08:35,153 --> 01:08:37,030
Darvan, it's them!

1689
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:40,742
Darvan?
Spray me.

1690
01:08:40,742 --> 01:08:43,077
It helps me
suck more.

1691
01:08:43,077 --> 01:08:44,704
Yo, like a big
E‐Z Pass.

1692
01:08:44,704 --> 01:08:47,081
You have to wet the plastic
thingy so they stick.

1693
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:49,625
So you want us
to help lower you down?

1694
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:53,212
Uh, it's real high, but don't
worry about me, Telulah Farrow.

1695
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:55,256
This can't fail.

1696
01:08:55,256 --> 01:08:57,967
I tied the rope
to that thing.

1697
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:00,887
No, how can that fail?

1698
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:07,393
All right.
(grunting)

1699
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:10,021
Whoa, this is higher
than I thought.

1700
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:16,569
Still, hold onto that rope
with your lives anyways.

1701
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:19,405
If it slips,
these plungers will save me.

1702
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:22,408
I saw it in a movie!

1703
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:24,869
Hey, I got it.
I don't got it, ahh!

1704
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:27,372
(screaming)

1705
01:09:27,372 --> 01:09:29,415
Telulah Farrow!

1706
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:31,793
I suck too much,
Telulah Farrow!

1707
01:09:31,793 --> 01:09:33,211
I suck too much!

1708
01:09:33,211 --> 01:09:34,587
I can't‐‐
I can't move!

1709
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:37,131
Darvan, don't panic.
Just, um...

1710
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:38,633
Uh, use your legs.

1711
01:09:38,633 --> 01:09:42,095
Okay, now, try to
break off the suction.

1712
01:09:42,095 --> 01:09:43,846
And fend off!
Fend off!

1713
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:45,890
(Darvan grunting)
(Jamie laughing)

1714
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:48,518
Jamie, yank it.

1715
01:09:48,518 --> 01:09:50,645
Yank it!
I think I peed!

1716
01:09:50,645 --> 01:09:52,480
Oh, my God, he looks like
one of those, like,

1717
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,524
plush toys stuck
to the car windows.

1718
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:57,527
(Telulah) Hang on, Darvan, okay? (whimpering)

1719
01:09:57,527 --> 01:10:01,197
Now, um... what do you see?
What are they doing?

1720
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:03,783
Uh, making‐‐ making
phone calls, I think.

1721
01:10:03,783 --> 01:10:06,786
Texting maybe.
I... I'm so sorry.

1722
01:10:06,786 --> 01:10:09,414
I'm so sorry.
This was supposed to be our‐‐

1723
01:10:09,414 --> 01:10:12,125
our big action scene,
Telulah Farrow.

1724
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:13,960
I hope they're not
calling the cops.

1725
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:16,754
(Darvan)
My tee‐tee's are stuck!

1726
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:19,340
My‐‐ my tee‐tee's are stuck.

1727
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:22,427
(chuckling) Oh, my God,
I have to Insty this.

1728
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:28,683
Wait... dude...
dude, someone already did.

1729
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:32,687
(man)
Yo, give me a knife.

1730
01:10:32,687 --> 01:10:35,606
Oh, my God, All Time Low's
gonna kill Darvan.

1731
01:10:35,606 --> 01:10:38,067
(plungers pop)

1732
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:41,863
(Jaime) Come on, Telulah,
it's just like in gym.

1733
01:10:41,863 --> 01:10:44,365
I could never do those ropes
in gym anyway.

1734
01:10:44,365 --> 01:10:47,368
And if you're holding my legs,
I'm just gonna fall.

1735
01:10:47,368 --> 01:10:49,954
(weakly)
I can't jump.

1736
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:51,789
Well, I can't‐‐

1737
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:53,666
It's like two feet,
Telulah, just jump.

1738
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:55,626
Darvan could be dead.
(groans)

1739
01:11:01,174 --> 01:11:03,384
Look at this.
Oh, my God.

1740
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:06,471
We can't take these.

1741
01:11:06,471 --> 01:11:09,015
Jamie. There's a million of them,
they'll never know.

1742
01:11:09,015 --> 01:11:10,975
God.

1743
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:13,394
Oh, my God.
I'm throwing up.

1744
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:14,520
Really?

1745
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,981
Damn it, Jamie,
theoretic vomit.

1746
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:18,900
Per usual.

1747
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:20,651
I can't meet
my favorite band

1748
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:23,070
in the entire universe
wearing this.

1749
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:26,699
(sighs)

1750
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:29,035
Do you think this is
Alex's pillow?

1751
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:31,162
Yeah, you think this is
Alex's girlfriend's?

1752
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:33,539
Mm‐hmm, don't touch that.

1753
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:35,583
Don't‐‐ don't...

1754
01:11:35,583 --> 01:11:38,294
Wait, don't mess it up.
Don't you need something to wear?

1755
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:41,714
That's just creepy.
That is so cr‐‐

1756
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:44,217
This is so cute.

1757
01:11:44,217 --> 01:11:47,094
(keypad clicking)

1758
01:11:47,094 --> 01:11:50,723
(sighing)
How are we gonna get there?

1759
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:55,728
Call your mom?

1760
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:59,106
No, seriously, the concert
starts in like 30 minutes.

1761
01:11:59,106 --> 01:12:02,318
If we're going backstage, we
basically have to be there now.

1762
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:04,695
Maybe you should
call your sister.

1763
01:12:08,115 --> 01:12:10,451
Darvan?

1764
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:12,662
We almost thought
you were dead.

1765
01:12:12,662 --> 01:12:15,039
No, Telulah Farrow.

1766
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:16,707
I am not "almost dead."

1767
01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:19,043
They saved me,
Alex or Jack.

1768
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:20,503
They look so much alike.

1769
01:12:20,503 --> 01:12:22,380
And I just kind of go, "Hey."

1770
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:24,340
And they go, "Hey."

1771
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:25,842
They look nothing alike.

1772
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:28,135
What happened?

1773
01:12:28,135 --> 01:12:30,763
Get in, get in.

1774
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:36,561
Yo, they were late
for The Space place.

1775
01:12:36,561 --> 01:12:38,312
So they were kind of
happy to see me.

1776
01:12:38,312 --> 01:12:40,231
(Telulah)
I knew they wouldn't kill you.

1777
01:12:40,231 --> 01:12:42,108
All Time Low is not like that.

1778
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:44,652
(Darvan) Yeah,
but that Vinny Vegas is one angry merch guy.

1779
01:12:44,652 --> 01:12:46,821
He could've killed me,
Telulah Farrow.

1780
01:12:48,072 --> 01:12:50,449
Telulah! And friends!
Oh, hi.

1781
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:52,118
I'm so glad
you're here.

1782
01:12:52,118 --> 01:12:53,744
Have you ever
been backstage?

1783
01:12:53,744 --> 01:12:56,038
Come on.

It was literally
the best night of my life.

1818
01:15:26,272 --> 01:15:28,607
Claire's dad,
he helped us,

1819
01:15:28,607 --> 01:15:30,943
he even let us film it,
and I'm right there.

1820
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:32,528
And then Alex
is right there.

1821
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:33,946
So there's, like,
very close proximity.

1822
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:36,782
And he even remembered me
from Jamaican Coffee Cafe.

1823
01:15:36,782 --> 01:15:39,785
And he said he liked "throw up"
and I swear, he was like...

1824
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:41,662
kind of looking at me

1825
01:15:41,662 --> 01:15:43,789
when he was singing
"Remembering Sunday."

1826
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:46,000
So...

1827
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,587
Well, I'm sure you're not
the first girl who thinks

1828
01:15:49,587 --> 01:15:51,714
that the singer of her
favorite band is singing to her.

1829
01:15:51,714 --> 01:15:54,884
But that Charlie kid, he was
definitely singing to you.

1830
01:15:58,929 --> 01:16:00,556
Did I ever tell you
about the time

1831
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:02,767
that I danced onstage
with The Good Rats?

1832
01:16:02,767 --> 01:16:05,644
The Good Rats.
Man, that was so stupid.

1833
01:16:05,644 --> 01:16:08,647
I was about your age.

1834
01:16:08,647 --> 01:16:10,649
I feel like whenever
you talk about your life,

1835
01:16:10,649 --> 01:16:12,693
it's all black and white
and sit‐comy.

1836
01:16:16,864 --> 01:16:18,616
Hmm.

1837
01:16:20,785 --> 01:16:24,371
I'm sure you texted
Charlie already.

1838
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:26,248
Are you listening?

1839
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:29,043
I literally
don't get you.

1840
01:16:29,043 --> 01:16:30,336
Okay, Telulah.

1841
01:16:30,336 --> 01:16:33,255
Well, you're being
really mean, Telulah.

1842
01:16:39,303 --> 01:16:41,305
(sighing)

1843
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:55,027
Hope you see this.

1844
01:16:57,196 --> 01:16:59,532
I'm feeling frightened
and disturbed, Mr. Somma.

1845
01:17:01,784 --> 01:17:05,037
The bus,
I fear it will explode.

1846
01:17:05,037 --> 01:17:07,039
(laughing)

1847
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:12,586
(dog barks) Hey, little dude,
that's not nice, man.

1848
01:17:21,595 --> 01:17:23,848
(man over P. A.)
<i>Good morning.</i>

1849
01:17:23,848 --> 01:17:25,516
<i>The debate team would</i>
<i>like to meet,</i>

1850
01:17:25,516 --> 01:17:28,477
<i>but they can't agree</i>
<i>on a time or place.</i>

1851
01:17:30,938 --> 01:17:32,565
Hey.

1852
01:17:32,565 --> 01:17:34,567
Nice work on the Spring
Talent Fest, Telulah.

1853
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:36,277
Oh...
(chuckling)

1854
01:17:36,277 --> 01:17:38,320
I felt like I was there.

1855
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,030
How's your final
project going?

1856
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:43,534
I got some incredible footage
at The Space last night.

1857
01:17:43,534 --> 01:17:45,995
But I don't wanna
give away too much.

1858
01:17:47,872 --> 01:17:50,166
Hmm...

1859
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:54,253
Telulah, these are still
your "Wonder Years."

1860
01:17:54,253 --> 01:17:56,255
Logan Circle?

1861
01:17:56,255 --> 01:17:57,923
I don't know what
you're saying to me,

1862
01:17:57,923 --> 01:17:59,341
but what I'm saying
is that sometimes

1863
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:01,260
we set out
for one thing

1864
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:03,804
and we're surprised
by something else.

1865
01:18:05,890 --> 01:18:07,850
It's becoming a theme.

1866
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:09,226
The hard part,
though,

1867
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:11,812
is deciding which is
more important.

1868
01:18:11,812 --> 01:18:14,899
In life, sure, but...

1869
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:17,776
especially in film.

1870
01:18:17,776 --> 01:18:20,571
I've seen a lot of
music videos, Telulah.

1871
01:18:23,574 --> 01:18:25,492
Paul...

1872
01:18:25,492 --> 01:18:27,536
I have nothing to say.

1873
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:29,955
Nothing.

1874
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:31,582
I don't have a movie.

1875
01:18:31,582 --> 01:18:34,126
And I'm not going to
win this, not for me...

1876
01:18:34,126 --> 01:18:36,503
you, or the school.

1877
01:18:37,755 --> 01:18:41,300
Nope, everybody's
got something to say.

1878
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:43,219
Look around, every kid
has a phone in their hand.

1879
01:18:43,219 --> 01:18:47,514
Sure, they're not talking,
but they're saying something.

1880
01:18:48,891 --> 01:18:51,352
No, not really.

1881
01:18:51,352 --> 01:18:55,189
Well, I would like to see
what they're all not saying.

1882
01:19:05,032 --> 01:19:06,867
(chuckling)

1883
01:19:06,867 --> 01:19:08,744
Wait, Paul,
that's brilliant.

1884
01:19:10,287 --> 01:19:12,289
Thank you.

1885
01:19:25,803 --> 01:19:27,805
(British accent)
Charles.

1886
01:19:29,223 --> 01:19:31,100
I'm so sorry.

1887
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:33,936
Wait, did you see
my Talent Fest video?

1888
01:19:33,936 --> 01:19:35,938
No, Telulah.

1889
01:19:35,938 --> 01:19:39,149
I haven't checked your posts
in the last 12 hours.

1890
01:19:39,149 --> 01:19:41,235
And, uh, yeah,
you can lose the accent.

1891
01:19:41,235 --> 01:19:43,237
(British accent)
Charles...

1892
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:49,618
(normal voice) But, Charlie,
it's really good. I think you'd like it.

1893
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:57,209
For the guy who gave me
the best night of my life.

1894
01:19:57,209 --> 01:19:59,712
You don't have to thank me
again, Telulah Farrow.

1895
01:19:59,712 --> 01:20:02,840
It's just the way I am.
Oh, my God, you scared me.

1896
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:05,009
Now, we have to start handing
these out, okay?

1897
01:20:05,009 --> 01:20:07,469
I texted as many people
as possible, but...

1898
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:14,101
Darvan‐‐ oh, um,
here you go.

1899
01:20:14,101 --> 01:20:15,853
What is this?
It's our group page.

1900
01:20:15,853 --> 01:20:18,439
You can post your favorite
videos, tweets and photos,

1901
01:20:18,439 --> 01:20:19,982
and maybe we'll feature it
in our movie.

1902
01:20:19,982 --> 01:20:21,692
No, I mean,
what is this?

1903
01:20:21,692 --> 01:20:24,194
Oh, a flyer?

1904
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:26,947
(man over P.
A.) <i>The Procrastinator's Club meeting scheduled for today</i>

1905
01:20:26,947 --> 01:20:28,907
<i>has been postponed</i>
<i>until, uh...</i>

1906
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:30,659
What's this?
A flyer.

1907
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:32,786
(Darvan over P. A.)
<i>Everyone go to our group page.</i>

1908
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:34,955
<i>It's called You Can Be</i>
<i>in a Scorsese Film.</i>

1909
01:20:34,955 --> 01:20:36,915
(man over P. A.)
<i>Hey, kid, give me that.</i>

1910
01:20:36,915 --> 01:20:38,709
<i>I'm the principal,</i>
<i>not you.</i>

1911
01:20:43,172 --> 01:20:45,174
(door shuts)

1912
01:20:50,888 --> 01:20:52,890
(sobbing)

1913
01:20:55,059 --> 01:20:56,894
(Claire)
It's okay.

1914
01:20:56,894 --> 01:21:00,230
Claire? Who's crying?

1915
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:03,067
It's Rosemary.
I can't get her to stop.

1916
01:21:03,067 --> 01:21:04,568
She forgot her
Twitter password.

1917
01:21:04,568 --> 01:21:06,737
And the email she used
to create it is expired.

1918
01:21:06,737 --> 01:21:08,364
And now all her wit‐‐

1919
01:21:08,364 --> 01:21:11,075
all her wit
is gone forever.

1920
01:21:11,075 --> 01:21:13,118
Remember,
I had that tweet about

1921
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:15,120
moms on Facebook.
Moms on Facebook.

1922
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,331
And all my hashtag activism.

1923
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:19,249
You were
so progressive.

1924
01:21:19,249 --> 01:21:22,252
Oh, my God, and I tweeted
that photo of a landscape

1925
01:21:22,252 --> 01:21:24,546
made entirely of
Snoop Dogg's face.

1926
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:27,299
I was so proud of that,
it got 30 favorites.

1927
01:21:27,299 --> 01:21:29,718
Calm down, did you tweet it
or Insty it?

1928
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:32,429
Tweeted.
(sobbing)

1929
01:21:32,429 --> 01:21:34,473
Insty!

1930
01:21:34,473 --> 01:21:37,267
I told Josh
you were not his type.

1931
01:21:37,267 --> 01:21:39,061
You are so mean,
Holly.

1932
01:21:39,061 --> 01:21:41,522
Can't you see
