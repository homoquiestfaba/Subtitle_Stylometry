00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,009
When you're dead,
you get to stop all the bullshit.

518
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:26,014
No more DMV lines,
no more shopping Christmas...

519
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,390
Or backstabbing girlfriends.

520
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,101
[Five] They should make
an "Out of Office" reply for dead people.

521
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,865
"Sorry I'm away from the planet right now.

522
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,312
I'm fucking dead."

523
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:36,024
No more tax, no more criminal records,

524
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:40,320
no more getting arrested by the pigs
just for being naked or just usual stuff.

525
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:42,697
You know, being naked, getting drunk.
Casual stuff.

526
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,878
[Five]
Know the best part about being dead?

527
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:47,118
- [Four] Mm.
- [Five] No more immigration lines.

528
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,746
Don't look at me like that.
I'm fucking American.

529
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,039
I'm illegal.

530
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:52,916
You guys sure are cynical.

531
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,250
How about high blood pressure?

532
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,894
Fuck you, high blood pressure.
I'll eat whatever the fuck I want.

533
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,254
Thank you very much.

534
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,465
You realize you're actually still alive,
right?

535
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,427
[electrical hum]

536
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,141
Fuck you, too, technology.

537
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:12,620
[One] <i>What they don't know
is I've been making magnets</i>

538
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,687
<i>since my seventh grade
science fair project,</i>

539
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,953
<i>which I completely dominated, by the way.</i>

540
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:19,692
<i>I figured out
how to take big stuff like this...</i>

541
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:20,902
This is pure shit.

542
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:21,986
<i>...into this.</i>

543
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,365
<i>I came up with neodymium, micro magnets.</i>

544
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,408
<i>Equal vibrating phones,
ten million cell phones...</i>

545
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:30,012
- [cell phone ringing]
<i>- ...Priuses, Teslas, all use my ingenuity.</i>

546
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:33,081
And someday,
this will make me very, very rich.

547
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,207
[girl laughs]

548
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:38,169
You guys, you got it all wrong, you know.

549
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,505
Best thing about being dead...

550
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:42,423
is the freedom.

551
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,718
I mean, we're all gonna die.

552
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:49,138
May as well do it
while we're alive, right?

553
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:52,809
When you're young, you lock yourselves
into all of these bad decisions.

554
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:55,854
You know, marriages and mortgages,
and all that kind of stuff.

555
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:56,938
But you die...

556
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,400
it's all erased.

557
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,528
Poof! Gone.

558
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:09,242
From that point forward,
all that matters is what you choose.

559
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,162
The point is that we should bring Seven
behind the curtain.

560
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:15,164
You wanna hand me those over there?

561
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:19,377
Here we go. All right,
a little demonstration, no technology.

562
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:24,549
This is how to stage a coup
in three not-so-easy steps.

563
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:27,427
All right, you got a country,
Turgistan, yeah?

564
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,555
These are the people, nice people,
going about, doing their thing.

565
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:35,643
Then you got the four generals,
<i>cuatro </i>cunts, very bad guys.

566
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,228
But there's one worse guy.

567
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,606
That's the piece-of-shit dictator.

568
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,608
Right there at the top.

569
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:42,984
Don't forget his brother.

570
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,694
[Three] Democracy-loving brother.

571
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,487
He's the key.

572
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:50,783
So, we're gonna hit the four generals.
They're gonna lead us to the brother.

573
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:54,120
You kill top generals,
you fuck a dictator's day.

574
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:56,243
The second thing we're gonna do
is free the brother.

575
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:59,459
The last thing that we're gonna do
is we're gonna say goodbye

576
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:03,838
to piece-of-shit dictator
and hello to democracy-loving brother.

577
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,133
It all goes down in four months.

578
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:10,470
<i>El Día de los Muertos.</i>
The Day of the Dead.

579
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,266
Oh, that's it?

580
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,436
Oh, well, that's pretty simple, you know?

581
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,188
It's cups.

582
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,943
[sucks teeth] So, we're all gonna die?

583
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:26,778
Not me.

584
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,113
She's not. We all are.

585
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,241
- Painfully.
- [Seven] Yeah, y'all are funny.

586
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:35,703
So, what else can you tell me
about this guy Rovach in Turgistan?

587
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:38,957
[ticking]

588
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,042
[ticking slows, stops]

589
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,273
[reporter 1] <i>On the Turgistan border,</i>

590
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:46,089

[inaudible]

596
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,823
A million people have been displaced
since the conflict began.

597
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:14,951
We have over 80,000 in this camp alone,
nearly half of them children.

598
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,744
- Heartbreaking. God.
- Yeah.

599
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,955
I'd love to show you
the hospital we just built.

600
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:20,498
We're not gonna go to the hospital.

601
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:22,458
I'm a little behind
on my malaria pills, but...

602
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,085
Malaria's not an issue in this part.

603
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,294
I'll be the judge of that.

604
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,547
Here's what we're gonna do, though.
Okay, I'm gonna...

605
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,174
- What's your name again?
- Oliver.

606
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:33,386
Oliver. Oliver here is gonna take
a picture of us right there,

607
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:36,848
and then I am going to take some shots
of some kids, hopefully not too sick,

608
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,808
nothing too depressing, no amputees.

609
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:41,310
- Then I'm gonna carry some...
- [shutter clicks]

610
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,146
...you know, water jugs around,

611
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:46,482
and then I'm gonna cut your foundation
a giant check.

612
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,192
- Okay, what's your name again?
- Mike.

613
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,361
Yeah, okay. Thank you, Mike.

614
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:54,032
Watch out there.

615
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,867
- Please, let me help you.
- It's balanced.

616
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:56,784
If I dropped one,

617
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,037
- I'd just walk around in circles.

What's that rich guy doing here?

619
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,291
[man] I don't know.
Photo op for social media?

620

Showing he cares?

621
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,712
I should've been a soccer player.
I could've gone pro.

Come with us! We gotta get the masks!

But, sir...

651
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:45,638
- Where did you find this?
- Social media, sir.

652
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:48,933
It's everywhere. News outlets
and foreign governments are greeting it

653
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,434
with universal condemnation.

654

It's all perfectly bloodless.

658
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:02,947
Who do you think shot it?

659
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,573
Impress me.

660
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:06,951
You shot it,

661
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,203
had it shot and leaked,

662
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:12,832
to communicate resolve, inspire fear.

663
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:20,840
Show my enemies what's in store for them
and for those they love.

00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,479
Say that I slew them not.

Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake.

671

[male actor]
Never came poison from so sweet a place.

Never hung poison on a fouler toad.

00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:23,986
I'll take a Negroni.

681

Just poured.

682
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,324
Sorry?

On the... On the play?

684

00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,841
There's our backdoor to Hong Kong.

1029
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:09,466
[Seven] Hey, One!

1030
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:11,678
You ever plan on calling me Six?

1031
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:14,180
- No.
- [Seven] Okay.

1032
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:17,535
- Hey, look, I know we don't get to ask...
- [Three] Then don't.

1033
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:19,352
[Seven] But, uh, who is One?

1034
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,563
- Who is he?
- [Five] A rich guy who snapped.

1035
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:22,480
That's all I got.

1036
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:24,691
- Yeah, but how did you meet him?
- We didn't.

1037
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:27,485
He met us. In really weird ways.

1038
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:28,987
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah. Very weird,

1039
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:31,781
- like, perfect timing kind of weird.
- [ticking]

1040
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:34,576
[ticking slows, stops]

1041
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:36,828
- [man speaking in Ukrainian]

1042
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:38,163
[speaking in Ukrainian]

1043
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:43,251
[in English] Cheap. Fake.

1044
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:46,754
Fuck! We ain't leaving
till we find the Kalahari.

1045
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:48,173
[shouts in Ukrainian]

1046
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:49,674
[tense electronic music playing]

1047
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:01,060
Let's go.

1048
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:06,483
[police siren wailing]

1049
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:29,214
Oh, shit.

1050
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:30,715
[yells in fright]

1051
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:35,636
Shit!

1052
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:41,058
[woman exclaims]

1053
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:43,770
[both grunting in exertion]

1054
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:45,021
Whoa, whoa!

1055
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:48,983
Grab my hand! Grab my hand!

1056
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:50,651
[man]
Hang on!

1057
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:57,242
[Four grunts loudly]

1058
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,285
[Four screams]

1059
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:09,170
[grunts]

1060
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:12,673
[panting]

1061
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:14,300
[woman] I'm rich.

1062
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:21,224
[grunting in exertion]

1063
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:26,479
[panting]

1064
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,861
What do you want?
What do you fucking want?

1065
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:35,947
Hey! Hey! Calm down.

1066
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:38,908
What are you? Are you a fucking pig?

1067
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,288
Are you afraid?

1068
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:46,082
Never.

1069
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:51,921
There's power in that.

1070
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:56,134
More power finding a cause.

1071
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:00,966
Something so important
that you're afraid to lose it,

1072
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:03,266
afraid that you're gonna die
some other way.

1073
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:04,517
For nothing...

1074
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:07,496
- instead of what you're fighting for.
- You're making a mistake to do this.

1075
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,688
[stammers] I'm a thief.

1076
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,982
I've been robbing my whole f...
I can make you money.

1077
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:12,734
- Are you afraid?
- I've got skills.

1078
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:15,987
- I can be useful. I can help you.
- You're gonna die now.

1079
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:17,923
- I can fucking help you!
- Gonna fucking die now.

1080
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:20,366
- If you're gonna do it, fucking do it.
- You die now!

1081
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:21,451
Fucking do it!

1082
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:23,453
[grunts]

1083
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:27,957
[snickering]

1084
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:31,836
- Oh, my God!
- You sick fuck! Who fucking does that?

1085
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:34,756
- You should have seen your face.
- You sick fuck!

1086
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:36,174
It's not fucking funny!

1087
01:00:36,257 --> 01:00:37,717
It's really funny.

1088
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:41,304
Ooh, I never thought I'd meet a family
more screwed up than mine.

1089
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:44,307
Hey, no. Don't say that.
He hates the word "family." I don't know.

1090
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:45,516
I think he never had one.

1091
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,644
And if you're ever left behind
in a mission...

1092
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:49,646
he's not coming back for you.

1093
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:50,729
[laughs] What?

1094
01:00:51,272 --> 01:00:52,940
We Deltas don't operate like that.

1095
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:55,985
Things are gonna have to change.
I promise you that.

1096
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:59,530
<i>FMS, Hong Kong. Engine start.</i>

1097
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:03,284
Look, I know we're not supposed to ask,
but I'm a nosy dude.

1098
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:04,827
So, here goes.

1099
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,663
You could have fought a million battles.

1100
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:09,666
Why now... and why Turgistan?

1101
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:13,294
Everybody talks about helping.
It's nice to actually do something.

1102
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:18,633
[suspenseful electronic music playing]

1103
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:35,566
[Rovach]
It is quite the view, little brother.

1104
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:40,863
Personally, I'd prefer more gold,
you know.

1105
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:43,950
Black.

1106
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:47,161
- I'm alone.
- Closing on you, it's, like, dark.

1107
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:51,082
You know Sultan Ahmed I?

1108
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:52,625
That shit.

1109
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:57,213
[Murat] In 1603, Sultan Ahmed I
gave a gift to his younger siblings.

1110
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:59,298
Magnificent wing in Topkapi Palace.

1111
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:00,550
The gilded cage.

1112
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:03,386
Yeah, I've learned my history, too.

1113
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:07,306
Would you prefer the sultans before Ahmed?

1114
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:11,227
Who strangled the younger brother
with the same silk sheets?

1115
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:18,067
You have your own library, screening room.

1116
01:02:18,776 --> 01:02:20,445
Yeah, it's a fun prison.

1117
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:23,448
And this, what is... what is this?

1118
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:24,741
Art.

1119
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:25,867
Ugly art.

1120
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:29,412
And the occasional visit
from a loving brother.

1121
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:32,582
Quite generous after you tried to take
what was rightfully mine.

1122
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:34,917
The throne is not yours or mine.

1123
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:37,503
- It belongs to the people.
- The people?

1124
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:39,005
[Murat] Yes, brother, the people.

1125
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:40,798
Like they're some sacred body.

1126
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:46,220
Instead of a violent, ignorant,
illiterate mob who just begs for the whip.

1127
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:48,556
He's got his anger issues.

1128
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,518
What are you doing here?

1129
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:56,063
These shameful chemical attacks of yours,

1130
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:58,566
you're making me more popular
than yourself.

1131
01:02:59,525 --> 01:03:01,360
The only way you'll ever leave this place

1132
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:04,489
is if Daqeeq here throws you
through that window.

1133
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:06,032
I wish.

1134
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,161
[sighs]

1135
01:03:13,247 --> 01:03:16,125
My generals, the Four Horsemen,
were just executed.

1136
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:19,128
Do you know anything about that?

1137
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:21,756
Do you?

1138
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:24,258
[mouths]

1139
01:03:25,551 --> 01:03:27,220
These attacks on my generals

1140
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:30,223
will only increase the frequency
of my chemical strikes.

1141
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:35,061
It may take years,
but they will carve you up

1142
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:38,356
for all the beautiful things
you have done for these people.

1143
01:03:38,439 --> 01:03:41,025
Who? The US? They made me.

1144
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,986
Russia? They armed me.

1145
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:48,825
Daqeeq, seriously?

1146
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:50,535
Did you buy that shirt by yourself?

1147
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:52,410
You're embarrassing me.

1148
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:54,705
Sorry. I have bad taste.

1149
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:59,085
Daqeeq is under strict order:

1150
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:02,964
If any harm should befall me,
the same exact harm will befall you.

1151
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:04,841
Specifically and immediately.

1152
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,301
I'm going back to Turgistan.

1153
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:09,595
To my safe travels.

1154
01:04:13,307 --> 01:04:14,976
[Seven] <i>Hey, team, we're below radar.</i>

1155
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:17,687
<i>So, buckle up
'cause it's about to get bumpy.</i>

1156
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:19,689
Oh, fuck me.

1157
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:23,568
You know, I usually look at the stewardess
to see if I should be scared.

1158
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:25,736
Flight attendant.

1159
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:27,989
You can look at me.

1160
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:31,242
Oh, darling, you could be on fire,

1161
01:04:31,325 --> 01:04:33,925
and you would have the same creepy,
blank expression on your face.

1162
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:34,954
No offense.

1163
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:37,582
You know, guys, what sucks?

1164
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:41,586
If we were to crash,
no one would ever know or care.

1165
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:43,421
We would have no impact on anything.

1166
01:04:43,504 --> 01:04:44,797
Like we never existed.

1167
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:47,651
[One, on intercom] <i>I can hear you,
and if you're gonna shit your pants,</i>

1168
01:04:47,675 --> 01:04:49,176
<i>there's a bathroom in the back.</i>

1169
01:04:49,635 --> 01:04:52,305
[suspenseful electronic music playing]

1170
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:55,266
[One] <i>The world is wrapped in red tape,</i>

1171
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:59,312
<i>and I couldn't cut through it
even with a billion-dollar sword.</i>

1172
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:02,231
<i>So, we left behind everything,</i>

1173
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:04,525
<i>everyone,</i>

1174
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:05,776
<i>to become...</i>

1175
01:05:06,527 --> 01:05:07,527
<i>no one.</i>

1176
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:13,993
So, how long's this been going on?

1177
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:16,245
What?

1178
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:19,081
I've been wondering the same thing.
Florence?

1179
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:21,167
Nah, Vegas.

1180
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,127
- Vegas.
- [Seven] Definitely Vegas.

1181
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:25,421
So, you guys know about us?

1182
01:05:25,504 --> 01:05:26,380
[Seven laughs]

1183
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:28,883
- Well, we do now, dumbass.
- [Seven] Nice.

1184
01:05:28,966 --> 01:05:31,594
Well, I guess it's not against the rules,
right?

1185
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:35,264
Depends.
So, are you guys fucking or making love?

1186
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:36,515
What's the difference?

1187
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:38,266
We're fucking.

1188
01:05:39,518 --> 01:05:40,645
Oh, good.

1189
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:43,230
Hey. Who's this honey badger?

1190
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:45,566
- I'm... I'm Raymond.
- [One] Hi, Raymond.

1191
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:46,901
You new to the team?

1192
01:05:46,984 --> 01:05:48,486
Just... Just hanging out.

1193
01:05:49,153 --> 01:05:50,153
It's Britney, bitch.

1194
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:53,240
So, we should probably go discuss
our sensitive geopolitical issues

1195
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:56,035
when we're, you know, Raymond-free.
Great security, though.

1196
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:57,286
Really great.

1197
01:05:57,745 --> 01:05:58,829
Especially you.

1198
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:02,959

01:43:13,061 --> 01:43:14,313
[One] <i>Time clock. Guys.</i>

1870
01:43:14,396 --> 01:43:15,731
Let's go. Go.

1871
01:43:23,906 --> 01:43:25,824
President. Ready to go underway.

1872
01:43:38,587 --> 01:43:39,838
[yells]

1873
01:43:39,922 --> 01:43:40,923
[grunts]

1874
01:43:41,006 --> 01:43:42,257
[laughs]

1875
01:43:42,341 --> 01:43:44,301
[laughs]

1876
01:43:45,260 --> 01:43:47,100
- [in Italian] Where did you come from?
- Whoo!

1877
01:43:47,304 --> 01:43:48,347
[in English]
Hello.

1878
01:43:53,352 --> 01:43:54,603
[protesters chanting]

1879
01:43:57,898 --> 01:43:58,898
Why are we not moving?

1880
01:43:58,941 --> 01:44:00,317
[speaking Turkmen]

1881
01:44:00,776 --> 01:44:02,069
Cauliflower is very nice.

1882
01:44:02,152 --> 01:44:04,321
- I wanna move!
- I told the captain to move.

1883
01:44:04,404 --> 01:44:06,907
- There's nothing more I can do.
- I want to move right now!

1884
01:44:06,990 --> 01:44:08,742
He's German. He's very precise.

1885
01:44:08,825 --> 01:44:10,661
Start the engines. Prepare to leave.

1886
01:44:10,744 --> 01:44:12,079
[guests screaming, shouting]

1887
01:44:14,665 --> 01:44:16,667
[beeping]

1888
01:44:20,796 --> 01:44:22,464
[Two] <i>Side door is opening.</i>

1889
01:44:40,357 --> 01:44:41,900
Take the wheel! Take the wheel!

1890
01:44:43,485 --> 01:44:44,861
[ship horn blares]

1891
01:44:53,996 --> 01:44:54,913
Lock the boat down.

1892
01:44:54,997 --> 01:44:56,498
Everyone, strap on body armor,

1893
01:44:56,581 --> 01:44:58,083
<i>and tell the captain let's get going.</i>

1894
01:45:00,877 --> 01:45:02,254
[captain] Captain of the Kismet.

1895
01:45:02,337 --> 01:45:03,547
I need military escort.

1896
01:45:03,630 --> 01:45:05,966
Not so fast. We're gonna stay and party.
Get down.

1897
01:45:06,049 --> 01:45:07,926
Down. Get down. On your knees.

1898
01:45:08,010 --> 01:45:10,178
- All right.
- Show me your hands, <i>por favor.</i>

1899
01:45:10,721 --> 01:45:11,763
Two hands!

1900
01:45:14,725 --> 01:45:18,270
[man, on radio] <i>This is Turgistan security
on the Kismet. Pirates have just...</i>

1901
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:20,564
[Four] <i>Comms cut. We're good.</i>

1902
01:45:27,195 --> 01:45:28,697
<i>- Bonjour.</i>
- Hi.

1903
01:45:28,780 --> 01:45:29,780
- Hey.
- Hi.

1904
01:45:33,368 --> 01:45:34,411
Hey, <i>papi.</i>

1905
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:45,964
Listen closely.

1906
01:45:47,049 --> 01:45:48,383
The enemy is us.

1907
01:45:49,051 --> 01:45:51,720
We must target him not where he is strong
but where he's weak.

1908
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:54,598
<i>Hospitals, to take away his safety.</i>

1909
01:45:55,098 --> 01:45:57,684
<i>Schools, to take away his future.</i>

1910
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:01,480
Youth, to suffocate his hope.

1911
01:46:01,563 --> 01:46:02,397
[Murat] Stop.

1912
01:46:02,481 --> 01:46:04,459
- [Rovach] <i>Commence gas attack.
- </i>Get out of my way.

1913
01:46:04,483 --> 01:46:05,483
[Rovach] <i>Do it now.</i>

1914
01:46:06,651 --> 01:46:07,736
Do it!

1915
01:46:08,153 --> 01:46:09,153
<i>I said do...</i>

1916
01:46:09,654 --> 01:46:11,073
Join me, brothers.

1917
01:46:11,156 --> 01:46:13,450
So you don't have to kill
your own people again.

1918
01:46:14,576 --> 01:46:17,162
Tell the military to back away
from that boat.

1919
01:46:17,704 --> 01:46:21,166
Together, we will bring peace
to our beloved country.

1920
01:46:22,084 --> 01:46:23,085
We're good.

1921
01:46:24,252 --> 01:46:25,837
Guards have chest armor.

1922
01:46:25,921 --> 01:46:26,921
Yes, they do.

1923
01:46:26,963 --> 01:46:29,841
[Seven] We got the fancy composite Kevlar.
I hope this works, man.

1924
01:46:29,925 --> 01:46:32,165
- [One] It'll work.
- They have some fancy food up there.

1925
01:46:32,219 --> 01:46:34,179
Really? Tell me more about that.
Don't hold back.

1926
01:46:34,262 --> 01:46:38,809
This fish soup they call...
labu... labuan...

1927
01:46:38,892 --> 01:46:40,227
I'm fucking kidding. Focus.

1928
01:46:40,310 --> 01:46:42,771
It's so delicious, man.
They put this little cheese on it.

1929
01:46:43,313 --> 01:46:46,942
Does it have to be on the walkie-talkie?
And we're all standing right here. Yeah?

1930
01:46:47,359 --> 01:46:49,069
Don't you give me attitude, okay?

1931
01:46:49,152 --> 01:46:51,613
- Over and out.
- [muttering] I...

1932
01:46:51,696 --> 01:46:55,075
Don't scratch my boat with your guns.
It cost me one billion manat.

1933
01:46:55,158 --> 01:46:58,078
[adviser, in Turkmen]
You're untouchable now.

1934
01:46:58,161 --> 01:46:59,704
This is the safest ship on the seas.

1935
01:46:59,788 --> 01:47:02,749
It's a panic room with deck chairs.

1936
01:47:03,708 --> 01:47:06,461
[beeping increasing in pace]

1937
01:47:08,588 --> 01:47:11,883
[One, in English] When I pop this,
the magnet pulse lasts for 15 seconds.

1938
01:47:11,967 --> 01:47:12,967
[high-pitched tone]

1939
01:47:17,264 --> 01:47:19,433
Welcome to the world's biggest magnet.

1940
01:47:22,477 --> 01:47:25,689
I was thinking that when this is over,
I want you to meet my mother, yes?

1941
01:47:26,148 --> 01:47:28,191
[laughs] Oh, God. You didn't say that.

1942
01:47:28,275 --> 01:47:29,985
What? Yes, I said it.

1943
01:47:31,695 --> 01:47:33,113
What's wrong with you people?

1944
01:47:33,196 --> 01:47:34,656
[guests screaming, shouting]

1945
01:47:40,745 --> 01:47:42,581
Ooh! Big guns.

1946
01:47:42,873 --> 01:47:43,915
Ooh, la la!

1947
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:47,377
I found the back doors to Rovach's suite.

1948
01:47:47,461 --> 01:47:49,463
[guests speaking indistinctly]

1949
01:47:55,594 --> 01:47:56,803
Fuck!

1950
01:47:59,973 --> 01:48:01,641
[groans] Ah, fucking American-made!

1951

- [ship horn blares]
- [guests shouting, screaming]

1952
01:48:05,061 --> 01:48:06,438
The fucking chip fell out.

1953
01:48:07,105 --> 01:48:08,106
- What?
- What?

1954
01:48:08,190 --> 01:48:09,941
- The chip fell out!
- Well, fix it.

1955
01:48:10,025 --> 01:48:13,987
I can't just fix it, all right?
The phone is very fucking complicated.

1956
01:48:16,490 --> 01:48:18,825
No. No, no, no, no. No, no.
Go. Go, go, go.

1957
01:48:19,367 --> 01:48:21,929
- Sir, please, we must leave right now.
- Hungry. I went for a dip.

1958
01:48:21,953 --> 01:48:23,431
- I'm important guest.
- We have to...

1959
01:48:23,455 --> 01:48:24,775
I just went for a dip, all right?

1960
01:48:24,831 --> 01:48:26,625
This is succulent chicken, man.

1961
01:48:27,083 --> 01:48:28,877
- Show me your hands.
- This couscous?

1962
01:48:30,170 --> 01:48:31,171
Show me your hands!

1963
01:48:31,254 --> 01:48:32,464
[shouts in Turkmen]

1964
01:48:33,423 --> 01:48:34,423
Fine.

1965
01:48:35,675 --> 01:48:36,676
Hey.

1966
01:48:37,135 --> 01:48:38,178
You know what?

1967
01:48:39,346 --> 01:48:40,972
I would love to meet your mother.

1968
01:48:41,723 --> 01:48:42,891
Really?

1969
01:48:53,777 --> 01:48:54,777
[man screams]

1970
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:05,622
I'm really happy.

1971
01:49:05,705 --> 01:49:06,706
[yells angrily]

1972
01:49:06,790 --> 01:49:08,750
- [police siren wails]
- [Seven] Contact!

1973
01:49:16,383 --> 01:49:17,383
Come on.

1974
01:49:25,100 --> 01:49:26,540
- [One] <i>What the fuck?</i>
- [Seven] <i>One!</i>

1975
01:49:28,687 --> 01:49:31,898
- What the fuck?
- Put the phone down, and use your gun.

1976
01:49:40,282 --> 01:49:41,449
I got it, I got it! I got it!

1977
01:49:44,327 --> 01:49:46,079
- Grenade!
- [loud drone]

1978
01:50:03,305 --> 01:50:04,139
Gah!

[exclaims]

1985
01:50:41,885 --> 01:50:44,679
Holy shit!
I mean, I wasn't sure it would work.

1986
01:50:44,763 --> 01:50:47,682
I mean, I wasn't "sure" sure.
I had a suspicion, but I, uh...

1987
01:50:48,058 --> 01:50:50,101
God, this is all so fucking dangerous.

1988
01:50:50,185 --> 01:50:51,185
Move!

1989
01:50:54,189 --> 01:50:55,189
Hey, hey!

1990
01:50:55,231 --> 01:50:56,983
You like that phone <i>now, </i>motherfucker?

1991
01:50:57,400 --> 01:50:58,400
This thing is amazing.

1992
01:50:59,319 --> 01:51:01,404
Stop fucking around. We gotta find Rovach.

[groans]

1994
01:51:05,158 --> 01:51:06,493
Oh, shit. What happened?

1995
01:51:06,951 --> 01:51:08,536
What the fuck?

1996
01:51:10,413 --> 01:51:11,413
[electrical hum]

1997
01:51:12,832 --> 01:51:14,626
[in Turkmen]
This ship's some sort of magnet.

1998
01:51:20,799 --> 01:51:22,550
[in English] Jesus. What did you do?

1999
01:51:22,634 --> 01:51:24,010
You goddamn animals.

2000
01:51:24,094 --> 01:51:25,679
Don't look at me. She's the evil one.

2001
01:51:26,096 --> 01:51:27,639
- You did this?
- Yeah.

2002
01:51:27,722 --> 01:51:29,033
- Why?
- [Seven] If we don't move quick,

2003
01:51:29,057 --> 01:51:31,309
- they're gonna pull them from the boat.
- You're sick.

2004
01:51:31,393 --> 01:51:32,686
Disgusting.

2005
01:51:35,522 --> 01:51:36,731

- [Seven] They're getting their guns!

2018
01:52:46,718 --> 01:52:48,803
- Fix the phone!
- I'm trying!

2019
01:52:49,596 --> 01:52:51,723
The screen is <i>cracked!</i>

2020
01:52:55,310 --> 01:52:56,811
We get it! They're dead!

2021
01:52:57,228 --> 01:52:59,564
Shit. They got our position.
We need to move.

2022
01:52:59,647 --> 01:53:02,025
Honestly, I didn't think
we'd make it this far.

2023
01:53:02,567 --> 01:53:04,110
Go kill the engine.

2024
01:53:18,041 --> 01:53:19,751
[One] That is disgusting!

2025
01:53:19,834 --> 01:53:20,877
It was a flashbang.

2026
01:53:21,336 --> 01:53:22,462
Holy shit.

2027
01:53:23,463 --> 01:53:24,923
We should split up.

2028
01:53:28,301 --> 01:53:29,385
Go with him.

2029
01:53:30,470 --> 01:53:31,471
Get me to the boat.

2030

2034
01:53:52,075 --> 01:53:53,201
I feel like a Jedi.

2035
01:54:02,919 --> 01:54:04,337
Five, flush him out.

2036
01:54:19,519 --> 01:54:20,728
