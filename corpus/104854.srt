1
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,385
<i>Delia Shunt was 34.</i>

2
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:15,050
<i>She had fine, dirty-blond hair</i>
<i>and a strong, heavy ass...</i>

3
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,221
<i>which looked excellent in blue jeans.</i>

4
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:18,958
<i>And Delia was tough.</i>

5
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,160
<i>She beat up a guy in a bar once,</i>
<i>just for grabbing her ass.</i>

6
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:25,136
<i>He hit her back,</i>
<i>and she broke a chair over his head.</i>

7
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,435
Supper. Now.

8
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:36,612
- Hi.
- Hey.

9
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,412
- He's doing good.
- Good.

10
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:41,385
Johnny, give me that glove.
Sit down over here, Miss May.

11
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,311
Did you guys wash your hands?

12
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,620
- Yeah, outside on the hose.
- Right.

13
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,326
Excuse me.

14
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:53,957
I want you guys to have carrots, too,
all right?

15
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:55,866
Decoration.

16
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:58,327
Breast? Want a breast?

17
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,002
Yes, please. Thanks.

18
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:02,639
Yes, please.

19
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:05,310
Looks good, chef.

20
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,103
May I have some ketchup?

21
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,876
- We don't have any ketchup.
- I saw some.

22
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:14,585
All right, I'll get your ketchup.

23
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,948
- Need some help with your chicken, May?
- I had practice today.

24
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:21,493
- How was it?
- It went really well.

25
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:25,423
Did you fix the bike today?

26
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:26,862
Not yet.

27
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:35,030
Hey, Dad, they switched my game
to Thursday. Would you be able to come?

28
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:38,269
What?

29
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:41,473
They changed my game to Thursday.
Can you come?

30
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:42,514
What time?

31
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:44,743
- It's at 3:00.
- I'll be late, all right?

32
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,944
I'll come, but I'll be late.

33
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,511
- I'll save a seat for you.
- Okay.

34
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,889
<i>Wait, let me explain.</i>

35
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,858
<i>Delia's father, Pete Shunt...</i>

36
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:00,659
<i>was the first hippie in Catskill, New York.</i>

37
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:03,793
<i>He kept goats</i>
<i>and smoked grass he grew himself.</i>

38
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,872
<i>He even let the Seventh-Day Adventists</i>
<i>onto his property, just to rap with them.</i>

39
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,168
Who the hell are you guys?

40
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:12,302
Have you heard the good news,
the Gospel of our Lord?

41
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:13,367
No.

42
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:16,677
I wonder if we could take a few minutes
and tell you the good news?

43
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:19,240
Sure, I got all the time in the world.

44
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,844
Do you go to church regularly, sir?

45
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,085
Not in a long time.

46
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,822
We're with
the Seventh-Day Adventists Church.

47
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:30,056
- Cheers.
- We believe in the Second Coming of Christ.

48
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:33,656
A lot of other Christian churches
will celebrate the Sabbath on Sunday.

49
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:36,293
We take Sunday
as the first day of the week...

50
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,837
so that the Sabbath is actually on Saturday.

51
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:43,239
If you were to come down to our church,
it would be on a Saturday, not on a Sunday.

52
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:45,641
That's probably why I missed it.

53
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,677
<i>He got so friendly with a couple of them...</i>

54
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,809
<i>that one day</i>
<i>they brought their wives and kids.</i>

55
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,183
The Bible tells us<i>...</i>

56
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:58,519
<i>They had targeted Pete Shunt</i>
<i>as a sinner worth the hard sell.</i>

57
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:01,958
So, that's why we're urged
to keep our bodies pure<i>...</i>

58
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:06,225
<i>Delia was embarrassed to be seen,</i>
<i>because she had recently grown breasts.</i>

59
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:09,359
<i>No one else in class had them,</i>
<i>and they were huge.</i>

60
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:12,996
<i>She felt separated from her breasts,</i>
<i>and kind of awed by them.</i>

61
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,596
<i>They were magical objects...</i>

62
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,905
<i>and definitely not</i>
<i>Seventh-Day Adventist material.</i>

63
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,903
...individual nations, man.

64
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:25,007
- You know, it's all full of crap.
- Okay.

65
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:27,345
It's all run by corporations.

66
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,151
I agree with you, Pete.
But see, the bottom line is Christ.

67
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,121
If you don't stop smoking
these marijuana cigarettes...

68
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:38,357
and living an unclean life,
you are going to hell. It's that simple.

69
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:42,166
Who do you think you are, telling me?
Get off me!

70
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,032
Get the hell out of my house, now!

71
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:46,697
- We're going.
- Sons of bitches.

72
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,470
Telling me I'm going to hell.

73
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:54,244
<i>Pete was sad for days after that,</i>
<i>because he had promised himself...</i>

74
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:57,111
<i>he wasn't going to get so angry anymore.</i>

75
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:59,784
<i>He used to hit his wife occasionally...</i>

76
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:02,582
<i>but he hadn't done that in a long time.</i>

77
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:07,183
<i>Delia's mother left soon after the Adventists.</i>

78
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,696
<i>She was sick of being broke</i>
<i>and wearing head scarves.</i>

79
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,561
<i>She went out,</i>
<i>bought herself some beige separates...</i>

80
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:16,363
<i>and found a job in an insurance company.</i>

81
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:20,600
<i>Delia decided to stay with her dad,</i>
<i>because she felt he needed her more.</i>

82
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,373
<i>"Shunt" rhymes with "cunt."</i>

83
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:30,379
<i>That's not the reason Delia became</i>
<i>the school slut, but it didn't hurt.</i>

84
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:38,656
<i>Plus, she loved kissing.</i>

85
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:44,191
<i>By the time she was 12,</i>
<i>she had lost her virginity.</i>

86
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:48,359
<i>And she learned to act tough,</i>
<i>like she didn't care what people thought.</i>

87
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:52,029
<i>It was a great feeling,</i>
<i>once you got past the shame of it.</i>

88
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:54,935
<i>She learned to love her power.</i>

89
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:01,175
<i>It was her vocation.</i>

90
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,874
<i>When she came home after school...</i>

91
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,942
<i>she would go over</i>
<i>her conquests of the day...</i>

92
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:09,044
<i>and it would perk her up.</i>

93
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:17,553
<i>Delia married Kurt at 17,</i>
<i>because he asked her.</i>

94
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:20,355
<i>He asked her</i>
<i>because he couldn't stand the idea...</i>

95
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,663
<i>of any other guy with his hands on Delia.</i>

96
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,498
<i>Her ass, especially.</i>

97
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,895
<i>That beautiful, ripe ass.</i>

98
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,037
<i>Delia could stop traffic with that ass.</i>

99
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,939
<i>So, he married it.</i>

100
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:49,093
<i>Marriage gave new meaning to sex for Delia.</i>

101
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:51,796
<i>It was no longer only about power.</i>

102
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,894
<i>They really made love in the beginning.</i>

103
00:08:56,802 --> 00:09:00,932
<i>Once Kurt felt her love for him,</i>
<i>a violence crept into their lovemaking.</i>

104
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:05,603
<i>A force of rage Delia found exciting at first,</i>
<i>until she felt the bite of his coldness...</i>

105
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:08,306
<i>and she realized that he despised her.</i>

106
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:14,286
<i>But, by then it was too late. She loved him.</i>

107
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:21,988
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

108
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,467
Get in there!

109
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:35,664
Get away from me!
Both of you in the bathroom!

110
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:38,736
Claire, May, get in there! And shut up!

111
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,677
Shut up!

112
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:47,986
Mommy!

113
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,558
Honey...

114
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:00,521
open the door.

115
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,800
Open the door, please.

116
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:08,567
Honey, I love you.

117
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,032
Please, don't.

118
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,244
It's okay. I know you didn't mean it.

119
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:25,882
<i>It was her kids' pain</i>
<i>that finally broke through her inertia.</i>

120
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,984
<i>Listening to her babies</i>
<i>screaming and pleading...</i>

121
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:33,054
<i>and being unable to comfort them,</i>
<i>was like being murdered slowly.</i>

122
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,900
<i>After two hours,</i>
<i>it didn't matter that she loved her husband.</i>

123
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,403
<i>It didn't matter that she had no place to go.</i>

124
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,038
<i>She was taking her kids away.</i>

125
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:26,250
<i>She imagined herself going back to him,</i>
<i>as she had so many times before.</i>

126
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,749
<i>But this time her body wouldn't follow.</i>

127
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,583
I want you to wake up. Pumpkin, come here.

128
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:37,221
Come.

129
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,969
Are you coming or not?

130
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:52,866
- Hello.
- Come on in.

131
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,577
Someone will look at you in the morning.

132
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:03,808
Okay. Thanks.

133
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:25,202
<i>Delia didn't talk about her problems.</i>

134
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:28,297
<i>She intimidated the other women</i>
<i>with her silence.</i>

135
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,467
<i>She was just being careful.</i>

136
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:34,770
<i>She didn't want to get soppy.</i>
<i>She didn't want to make any mistakes.</i>

137
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,474
<i>She was leaving.</i>

138
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:40,545
<i>She felt the women's pain and uncertainty</i>
<i>like a vortex...</i>

139
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,883
<i>pulling her into her own muddled thinking.</i>

140
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:45,924
- What happened?
- She fell off the shelf.

141
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:49,285
She looks pretty good now. Okay.

142
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,529
Did you get something to eat?

143
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:53,622
Go on.

144
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,797
Go on and play.
You want to go play some more?

145
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:06,710
Let's talk about practical things.

146
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:11,278
It must be nice doing good 24 hours a day.

147
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,274
I don't know.

148
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:16,353
Some days, I don't think
it makes any difference.

149
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,851
Does that get you down, Pam?

150
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:24,423
We all have problems, Delia.

151
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:33,161
You ever been in love
with a man who hits you?

152
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:35,097
No.

153
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,105
Do you have any kids?

154
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,768
I don't.

155
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,876
Then leave me alone.

156
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,442
I'm sick of seeing your face
every fucking day...

157
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:49,146
smiling like you just took
the greatest shit of your life.

158
00:14:56,395 --> 00:15:00,126
Have you thought about
another place to live when you leave?

159
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:03,033
I've thought about it.

160
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:07,038
Your husband came around again,
asking to see the kids.

161
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:10,305
He'll take them if he sees them.

162
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:13,976
You can...

163
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:18,841
stay here as long as you need to.
You know that, right?

164
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:24,251
Great. I fucking love it here.

165
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:35,393
<i>Delia lay awake that night</i>
<i>and racked her brain...</i>

166
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:38,368
<i>for people she knew that had left Catskill.</i>

167
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:44,499
<i>Finally, deep in the recesses</i>
<i>of her memory...</i>

168
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:48,540
<i>she remembered that fat Fay McDougherty</i>
<i>had moved upstate.</i>

169
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:54,642
<i>Fay had been an outcast like Delia,</i>
<i>but in a different category.</i>

170
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,790
<i>Delia had always felt protective of Fay...</i>

171
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:05,853
<i>even though</i>
<i>she did not particularly like her.</i>

172
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,771
<i>She was going to have to find Fay.</i>

173
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,636
<i>Hello?</i>

174
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,043
- Fay?
<i>- Yes?</i>

175
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:25,610
It's Delia Shunt.

176
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:32,285
I know it must be weird hearing from me.

177
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:34,421
I got your number from my mom.

178
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,121
She sold your mom some car insurance.

179
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,464
She mentioned that.

180
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:41,192
<i>I thought maybe...</i>

181
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,757
I'm kind of in a little bit of trouble.

182
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:48,637
I'm not wanted by the police or anything,
but I need to leave Catskill.

183
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:52,106
<i>I've got three kids...</i>

184
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,512
<i>and I thought maybe we could...</i>

185
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,480
crash out in your basement or something...

186
00:16:56,548 --> 00:17:00,814
for a couple weeks, just until I get a job
and work some stuff out.

187
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,548
Never mind. Sorry I bothered you.

188
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:10,059
No. You know,
maybe you can stay in the garage.

189
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,597
- Really?
<i>- I'd have to ask my husband, of course...</i>

190
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:15,132
<i>but it wouldn't be anything fancy.</i>

191
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:17,630
If it's got a roof, that's fine.

192
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:21,867
<i>There's a shower off the garage, too.</i>
<i>Greg put it in last year.</i>

193
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:23,201
Great.

194
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,037
<i>It's nice to hear your voice.</i>

195
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,842
Let's put that in the back.

196
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,148
Thanks.

197
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:41,051
Okay.

198
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:02,570
Is Dad coming?

199
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,613
No, honey.

200
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:36,405
Hey!

201
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,341
Hi!

202
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:42,449
- Hey.
- How are you?

203
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,222
- It's great to see you.
- You, too.

204
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,183
Thanks.

205
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,957
Sure. Hi. Gosh, they're beautiful.

206
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,521
They're really beautiful.
They look just like you.

207
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,331
I have cookies inside, if you'd like.
So, let me help you with your bags...

208
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:00,200
and we can go in.

209
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,033
Hi, sweetie.

210
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:05,804
Come on in the house,
and I'll show you around, okay?

211
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,415
- This is Greg, my husband.
- Hi.

212
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,148
- Come on in.
- You guys like to watch football?

213
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:19,747
- I don't know, sir.
- Come on over here.

214
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:21,824
You'll learn.

215
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:25,997
- This is my husband, Greg.
- Hi.

216
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:28,825
This is Delia...

217
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,234
and her adorable children.

218
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,437
You know what I got?

219
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:37,066
Is this the cutest thing?
Here, you gotta check this out.

220
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:41,806
A cat!

221
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,177
That's Tandy. You want to go see her?

222
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:47,577
Come here, you fucking cat.

223
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,714
Why don't you come on in?

224
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,718
Greg's father owns the bank in Wise.

225
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:59,296
Greg is one of the officers there.

226
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:04,266
Greg, poo, do you want iced tea?

227
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:06,371
No, I'm good. Thank you.

228
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:08,372
Kids, I've got cookies.

229
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:12,466
I'll put them right here, okay?
This way, no crumbs on the couch.

230
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:15,972
- Iced tea?
- Sure.

231
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:25,914
I just want to tell you, I'm really
sorry that you're having a difficult time.

232
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,622
Thanks.

233
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,326
How's your father?

234
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,927
He's all right. The same.

235
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:39,333
Does he still keep...

236
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,266
goats, was it?

237
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,830
He's retired.

238
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:52,349
Where do you think I could look for a job?

239
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,912
What sort of work do you care to do?

240
00:20:58,724 --> 00:20:59,986
Any kind.

241
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:09,627
I have a cousin...

242
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:12,930
down in Jersey.

243
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,736
New Jersey. He's about to have<i>...</i>

244
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:28,215
- Excuse me.
- I'll be with you in a minute.

245
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:31,717
Hey, Ma.

246
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,753
Just remember,
I'll be working at the hospital until 8:00.

247
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:39,661
So I should pick you up at,
like, 10:00, 10:30, right?

248
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:47,663
So, that's a Saab, right?
Out there, your car, that's a Saab?

249
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,764
Yeah.

250
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:53,607
Does it have heated seats?
Maybe a reversible hood, right?

251
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:54,941
'Cause I've worked on...

252
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:57,811
Listen, is there someone I can talk to
about a job?

253
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:02,644
<i>Delia was a good waitress.</i>

254
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:05,018
<i>She worked fast, remembered everything...</i>

255
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,184
<i>and frightened the customers just enough</i>
<i>to keep them in line...</i>

256
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,320
<i>while inciting their lust, if they were men...</i>

257
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,791
- Fries, please.
- All right.

258
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,824
<i>... and wariness, if they were women.</i>

259
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,537
<i>If anyone was rude to her,</i>
<i>she spat in their food.</i>

260
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:28,110
<i>It seemed fair.</i>
<i>She never did it when she had a cold.</i>

261
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,003
Nine times thirty?

262
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,658
That's right.

263
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:50,891
<i>The greasy son of the short-order cook</i>
<i>came in every day for a free lunch.</i>

264
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:53,062
Great shirt you're wearing.

265
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,544
<i>The kids all went to school down the road.</i>

266
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:14,654
Like I was saying, I live in the basement
because I have a water bed.

267
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:19,630
She wants me.

268
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,294
Hi.

269
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:28,597
What are you doing?

270
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:31,369
What does it look like I'm doing?

271
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,038
I always do the cleaning at night.

272
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:37,877
I know you do.
I just thought I would lend you a hand.

273
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:42,283
You know, the place really looked like
it needed a scrub. So, I just<i>...</i>

274
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:50,389
Don't bother trying to show
you're better than me.

275
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:52,730
I mean, shit, look at me.

276
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,392
Delia, I'm sorry. I really didn't<i>...</i>

277
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:59,427
I didn't mean anything by it.

278

<i>A freak accident in Manhattan</i>
<i>has left two men dead.</i>

Hey, Delia...

286
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:32,456
I don't guess you'd want
to take a ride with me sometime?

287
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:35,459
Where are you going to drive me,
Mylert? Crazy?

288
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,960
Right. I don't know, around.

289
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:41,996
We could go to the movies,
but that would be a date.

290
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,805
Pick me up after work.

291
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:54,576
I get off at 6:00.

292
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:01,407
So, I'll come by at, like, 8:00, 8:30, right?

293
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:29,367
Better get me back to my car.

294
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:31,738
I gotta feed my kids.

295
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,847
My mother's working nights
at the hospital this week.

- Hey, you're not my boyfriend, okay?
- I know.

your mom's schedule.

298
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:51,287
I just thought...

299
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:52,852
Stop thinking.

00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,806
Does W.H. Have an...

339
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:31,344
expense account here?

340
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,877
I really loved your first book.

341
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,284
It's a piece of shit.

342
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:40,347
- I think that's pretty common.
- What? Second thoughts after publication?

343
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:42,120
No, false modesty.

344
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,987
- Do you wish to hear our specials?
- The pasta's good.

345
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:49,829
- I'll have steak frites.
- Do you wish to hear our specials?

346
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:53,166
I'll just have
the mozzarella and tomatoes, and<i>...</i>

347
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:55,632
Do you want wine?

348
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:59,706
- Lf you<i>...</i>
- A bottle of house red, please.

349
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,309
Very well.

350
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:11,112
So, what's the new book about?
If you don't mind talking about it.

351
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:14,618
Laos, the trip over.

352
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:17,252
That must have been frightening.
How old were you?

353
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:20,297
I was 13, I had left my family.

354
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:24,567
- Have you written much?
- About 100 pages.

355
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:27,103
Aren't I the one
supposed to be asking questions?

356
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,661
I don't know.

357
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,036
What's your story?

358
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:34,801
I was born in Manhattan.

359
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,475
I went to the Fleming School uptown,
a small private, you know.

360
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:43,350
Then to boarding school,
then to college, then to law school.

361
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:47,489
My father's a lawyer. We're not talking.
My mother is...

362
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:49,552
dead.

363
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:52,285
They're divorced. I mean, they were.

364
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:54,292
I'm 28.

365
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:57,130
My father has a 3-year-old.

366
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,692
<i>God Almighty, please let me shut up.</i>

367
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:04,869
My friend Felicia Wong
said you were great at trimming fat.

368
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:09,241
<i>Felicia Wong</i>
<i>had written short stories at Harvard.</i>

369
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:13,611
<i>Greta was the editor of</i> The Advocate.
<i>She had an eye for the inessential.</i>

370
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:15,845
<i>The writers called her "The Grim Reaper"...</i>

371
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,388
<i>but they all wanted her</i>
<i>to comb through their work.</i>

372
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:20,253
She's a castrating bitch.

373
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:23,384
You're a lying bastard.
You deserve each other.

374
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,828
I have a tendency to overwrite.

375
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:30,329
I need someone to kick my ass.

376
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:33,132
I can kick your ass.

377
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:40,309
We'll renegotiate your contract next week.

378
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:48,977
<i>She went straight to the most expensive</i>
<i>shoe store she had ever heard of...</i>

379
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:52,648
<i>and put a pair of pointy alligator heels</i>
<i>on her credit card.</i>

380
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:56,284
<i>She couldn't begin to afford them,</i>
<i>but she needed to feel worthy.</i>

381
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,624
<i>She needed to feel like a pro.</i>

382
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,437
He wants me to do it!

383
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:15,106
- That's amazing.
- Why do I feel guilty all of a sudden?

384
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:17,545
Because you're crazy. Come here.

385
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:25,484
I am very, very proud of you.

386
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:29,720
<i>A toxic blend of anxiety and elation</i>
<i>was building up in Greta's mind.</i>

387
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:32,991
<i>It seemed to be actually pressing</i>
<i>against her skull.</i>

388
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:35,760
<i>She craved air. She wanted to go out.</i>

389
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:39,929
<i>She wanted to tell people her news.</i>
<i>She wanted to celebrate.</i>

390
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:42,768
<i>She remembered a party in Brooklyn</i>
<i>being given by Mimi...</i>

391
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,332
<i>an old friend from Exeter,</i>
<i>who had recently returned from India.</i>

392
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:56,044
- God, you scared me.
- You scared me, too.

393
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:00,250
<i>Oscar had been a suitor of Greta's at</i>
<i>Harvard, but she would not sleep with him.</i>

394
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:03,623
<i>Now, there was a gentle neutrality</i>
<i>in Oscar's tone.</i>

395
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:07,696
<i>He was speaking to her</i>
<i>as if she was mentally ill, or had cancer.</i>

396
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:09,426
<i>She knew why, too.</i>

397
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,900
<i>It was because</i>
<i>she had turned out to be a loser.</i>

398
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:14,961
- I'm sorry to hear about your mother.
- Thanks.

399
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,573
I was talking to your husband.
He seems like a really nice guy.

400
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:23,637
- He'll never leave me.
- That seems like a weird reason to...

401
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:26,444
That's not the main reason. I love him.

402
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:32,788
He's this wonderful person.
I think he's so funny and interesting<i>...</i>

403
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:35,115
- Great?
- He's the greatest.

404
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:37,788
- Great.
- He's a great guy.

405
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:41,263
- You don't have to convince me.
- What about you? Are you married?

406
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:43,095
God, no, I'm only 28.

407
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:47,229
- I'm only 28, Oscar.
- I mean, I<i>...</i>

408
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:51,332
Are you seeing anyone?

409
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:54,037
Yeah. We don't see each other a lot.

410
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:57,569
She's with the Boston Symphony.
I'm with the Brooklyn.

411
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:04,353
Are you still with that publishing<i>...</i>

412
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:06,652
Yeah, Warren and Howe, right.

413
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:10,289
Actually, I just got this great job...

414
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:12,921
editing Thavi Matola's new book.

415
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:17,293
The guy who wrote <i>Blue Mountain</i>?

416
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:22,104
- That's amazing.
<i>- God, I'm disgusting.</i>

417
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:25,903
- That's great.
- I've got to get back to Lee.

418
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:32,872
Is that still going on today,
with all that stuff<i>...</i>

419
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:39,645
I should get some sleep. I have to call
a guy at 6:00 about a fly-fishing article.

420
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:42,022
- I'm too excited to sleep.
- Stay.

421
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,926
- Yeah?
- Sure, yuck it up.

422
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:54,397
- Hi.
- How you doing?

423
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:55,905
Good. How are you?

424
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:57,736
It's amazing, right?

425
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:05,449
<i>She stayed longer than she intended,</i>
<i>and drank more than she should have.</i>

426
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:10,183
Want to share a cab?

427
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:14,682
I'm on 20th and 2nd. You can drop me off.

428
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:19,161
Share a cab.

429
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:23,693
I don't think so.

430
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:32,108
- Come home with me.
- No.

431
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:33,702
- Come on.
- Please.

432
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:35,939
- One conversation.
- No.

433
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:38,905
Shit.

434
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:53,696
<i>Greta was reminded of a day</i>
<i>10 years earlier...</i>

435
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:55,391
<i>the day that changed her life.</i>

436
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:59,497
<i>She drove to her parents'</i>
<i>country house from law school...</i>

437
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,765
<i>with some tremendous news for her dad.</i>

438
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,103
<i>A paper she had written</i>
<i>on capital punishment...</i>

439
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:07,508
<i>was going to be published</i>
<i>in the</i> Harvard Law Review.

440
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:10,736
<i>Greta's father, Avram Herskovitz...</i>

441
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,510
<i>was one of the most powerful lawyers</i>
<i>in the country.</i>

442
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:16,985
<i>He defended the indefensible.</i>
<i>He was on the news a lot, saying:</i>

443
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:20,182
This decision is a victory
for justice in this country.

444
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:22,748
<i>Some people thought he was a moral giant.</i>

445
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:27,355
<i>Others didn't think he cared about guilt</i>
<i>or innocence, only about winning.</i>

446
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:30,328
<i>Greta knew he was both of these things.</i>

447
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:32,894
<i>She wanted to be just like him.</i>

448
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,432
Dad?

449
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,046
<i>Greta recognized her.</i>

450
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:48,975
<i>She was the new junior partner</i>
<i>in her father's firm.</i>

451
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:51,344
<i>Greta'd always suspected her</i>
<i>of something...</i>

452
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:54,016
<i>but, until now, she didn't know what.</i>

453
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:57,586
- Where's Mom?
- I think she's upstairs.

454
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:18,841
<i>Greta's mother, Maroushka,</i>
<i>was 25 when she married Greta's father.</i>

455
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:23,750
<i>She was a Polish girl, born in Auschwitz</i>
<i>a week before the arrival of the Russians.</i>

456
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:28,121
<i>After the liberation, Maroushka</i>
<i>was brought up in a series of orphanages.</i>

457
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:31,184
<i>Her story stirred</i>
<i>some deep yearning in Avram.</i>

458
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:35,198
<i>He had to save this woman.</i>
<i>He had to give her a beautiful life.</i>

459
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:39,898
<i>He brushed his first family off</i>
<i>like leaves from a sweater.</i>

460
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:45,732
<i>When Greta was born, he cherished her.</i>
<i>She was his new beginning...</i>

461
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:50,809
<i>life sprung from the ash heap.</i>
<i>They were inseparable, alike.</i>

462
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:54,013
<i>As unconsciously as a leaf unfurling...</i>

463
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:57,815
<i>Greta chose to embody</i>
<i>her father's charming voraciousness...</i>

464
00:40:57,888 --> 00:41:01,324
<i>shrinking instinctively</i>
<i>from the wistful sweetness of her mother...</i>

465
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:04,725
<i>smelling, as it did, ever so faintly of death.</i>

466
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:11,026
<i>After the divorce,</i>
<i>Greta stopped speaking to her father...</i>

467
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:13,729
<i>returned his monthly checks unopened.</i>

468
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:17,334
<i>Then, one day,</i>
<i>she just dropped out of law school.</i>

469
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:20,502
<i>She couldn't lend meaning</i>
<i>to the words anymore.</i>

470
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:24,878
<i>That November,</i>
<i>Maroushka was diagnosed with cancer.</i>

471
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:29,649
<i>Greta moved back to New York</i>
<i>to be with her mother.</i>

472
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,378
<i>Maroushka died.</i>

473
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:34,389
<i>Avram's new wife had a baby girl.</i>

474
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:40,122
It's up in the mountain lakes,
is what you're saying.

475
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:43,825
And what baits are used for those?
Is it the same kind of bait...

476
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:47,632
that you're using in New England,
or for the introduced fish?

477
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:51,172
Which is like a worm, or that's a fly?
What is that?

478
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,611
And the females in May? Late May.

479
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,307
Okay.

480
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:03,318
Thank you very much for your time,
Mr. Conway. I think that's it.

481
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:11,184
I think that's all I need, Mr. Conway.
Good luck with the fish.

482
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:17,761
You want me to make you some pancakes?

483
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:20,499
I love you so much.

484
00:42:22,904 --> 00:42:27,102
<i>Thavi Matola encouraged Greta</i>
<i>to make radical suggestions for rewrites.</i>

485
00:42:27,175 --> 00:42:29,336
<i>They met a couple of times a week.</i>

486
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:32,277
What did you think about
this paragraph, here?

487
00:42:32,347 --> 00:42:37,512
- This part is new, and I return to it later.
- It is kind of redundant, though.

488
00:42:38,152 --> 00:42:42,680
I'll leave a mark by it.
If you want to cut it, we could just cut it.

489
00:42:43,124 --> 00:42:45,490
Basically, you said that before.

490
00:42:52,233 --> 00:42:53,598
You hungry?

491
00:42:57,672 --> 00:42:59,196
Are you hungry?

492
00:43:00,808 --> 00:43:01,900
What?

493
00:43:04,312 --> 00:43:06,746
What is happening to your hearing?

494
00:43:08,249 --> 00:43:12,151
How does your husband feel
about us working together like this?

495
00:43:12,387 --> 00:43:14,116
He's fine, I guess.

496
00:43:15,223 --> 00:43:16,850
He isn't jealous?

497
00:43:19,427 --> 00:43:21,395
I told him you were gay.

498
00:43:23,231 --> 00:43:25,131
Is that what you think?

499
00:43:27,035 --> 00:43:28,434
I vacillate.

00:43:30,104 --> 00:43:31,332
So do I.

501
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:05,238
- You want some tomato juice?
- Sure.

502
00:44:10,678 --> 00:44:14,409
<i>The truth is,</i>
<i>Greta had a little problem with fidelity.</i>

503
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:19,442
<i>She was reminded of an episode</i>
<i>that happened during her engagement...</i>

504
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,455
<i>and which stung her conscience to this day.</i>

505
00:44:28,596 --> 00:44:30,291
Excuse me. Do you have a cigarette?

506
00:44:30,364 --> 00:44:32,594
- No, I don't smoke.
- Too bad.

507
00:44:32,667 --> 00:44:35,261
- I think I should be congratulated.
- Did you quit?

508
00:44:35,336 --> 00:44:38,362
I was never addicted.
I used to smoke occasionally...

509
00:44:38,439 --> 00:44:41,067
then it struck me that it was idiotic.

510
00:44:41,742 --> 00:44:44,336
It wouldn't have been idiotic
if I was addicted...

511
00:44:44,412 --> 00:44:47,074
then it just would have been pathetic.

512
00:44:47,882 --> 00:44:53,013
- I'm sorry, I just got out of the shrink.
- No need to apologize. It's a stupid habit.

513
00:44:53,321 --> 00:44:56,256
- I'm quitting when I turn 25.
- When's your birthday?

514
00:44:56,324 --> 00:44:59,225
- The 23rd.
- I'm getting married on the 23rd.

515
00:45:01,229 --> 00:45:05,165
- Terrific. We should celebrate.
- An abstinence party.

516
00:45:06,367 --> 00:45:08,392
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

517
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:30,148
Bye.

518
00:45:47,808 --> 00:45:49,799
- I can still do it.
- Nice.

519
00:45:59,253 --> 00:46:01,118
What are you studying?

520
00:46:02,657 --> 00:46:05,217
I'm actually studying to be a rabbi.

521
00:46:06,027 --> 00:46:07,221
Really?

522
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:12,031
- You don't look like a rabbi.
- I'm not orthodox.

523
00:46:16,804 --> 00:46:20,968
<i>The next week was a tangle</i>
<i>of wedding preparations and subterfuge...</i>

524
00:46:21,108 --> 00:46:24,976
<i>what with traveling uptown to see Max,</i>
<i>and downtown to see Lee.</i>

525
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,604
<i>The fittings...</i>

526
00:46:28,716 --> 00:46:30,206
<i>the fucking...</i>

527
00:46:31,052 --> 00:46:32,952
<i>the bachelorette party.</i>

528
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:36,979
<i>Only her trusted friend, Lola Sanduli,</i>
<i>who knew Greta better than anyone...</i>

529
00:46:37,058 --> 00:46:39,925
<i>knew about Max.</i>
<i>And she felt the whole thing was harmless.</i>

530
00:46:40,328 --> 00:46:41,659
It's just Greta being Greta.

531
00:46:41,729 --> 00:46:42,991
<i>It didn't occur to Greta...</i>

532
00:46:43,064 --> 00:46:46,329
<i>to call the marriage off</i>
<i>because she was having a torrid affair.</i>

533
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,164
<i>She kept the two narratives distinct</i>
<i>in her mind.</i>

534
00:46:49,237 --> 00:46:51,967
<i>They coexisted, as if in twin universes...</i>

535
00:46:52,039 --> 00:46:54,507
<i>separated by vast fields of space.</i>

536
00:46:55,109 --> 00:46:59,341
<i>At the end of that crazy week,</i>
<i>Greta felt very much in love with Lee.</i>

537
00:46:59,914 --> 00:47:03,145
<i>The week with Max had left her</i>
<i>feeling absolutely gorgeous.</i>

538
00:47:03,217 --> 00:47:05,742
<i>Now, she wished he would disappear.</i>

539
00:47:10,891 --> 00:47:14,122
- Is he even Jewish?
- What difference does it make?

540
00:47:16,564 --> 00:47:17,588
Makes a difference.

541
00:47:19,433 --> 00:47:22,402
<i>They were married</i>
<i>in Lee's hometown in Ohio.</i>

542
00:47:26,507 --> 00:47:29,908
<i>Greta's father took her new life</i>
<i>as a personal affront.</i>

543
00:47:29,977 --> 00:47:32,172
<i>He didn't think Lee had size.</i>

544
00:47:32,913 --> 00:47:36,076
<i>Everyone in the Herskovitz clan</i>
<i>had to have size.</i>

545
00:47:36,183 --> 00:47:40,244
<i>But Lee made Greta feel safe,</i>
<i>and she adored his family.</i>

546
00:47:43,557 --> 00:47:46,856
Thank you, O Lord, for the meal
we are about to receive.

547
00:47:47,128 --> 00:47:50,029
And God bless everyone
in this home. Amen.

548
00:47:50,698 --> 00:47:55,533
<i>His pure, humble quest for knowledge</i>
<i>made her want to live a simple, decent life.</i>

549
00:47:55,636 --> 00:47:59,470
<i>She had stopped desiring other men.</i>
<i>She wanted to have a baby.</i>

550
00:48:00,808 --> 00:48:04,972
<i>She felt the ambition drain out of her,</i>
<i>like pus from a lanced boil.</i>

551
00:48:15,356 --> 00:48:18,223
So, how long is Matola going to take
to finish this book?

552
00:48:18,292 --> 00:48:19,816
I have no idea.

553
00:48:21,162 --> 00:48:25,360
- It could be years, right?
- Not everyone writes as slowly as you do.

554
00:48:32,973 --> 00:48:34,304
I'm sorry.

555
00:48:38,679 --> 00:48:40,670
<i>A tacit agreement</i>
<i>had grown between them...</i>

556
00:48:40,748 --> 00:48:44,650
<i>that she wouldn't see Lee's dissertation</i>
<i>until it was finished.</i>

557
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:49,387
<i>Now, she felt perversely drawn to the text.</i>

558
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:09,132
<i>As she read it,</i>
<i>it was all she could do to stop herself...</i>

559
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:11,542
<i>from deleting whole paragraphs.</i>

560
00:49:11,979 --> 00:49:15,278
<i>The thing was swollen to bursting</i>
<i>with redundancies.</i>

561
00:49:17,952 --> 00:49:19,943
Why can't he write like he talks?

562
00:49:20,488 --> 00:49:24,288
But do you need that?
Do you think you really need this part?

563
00:49:27,895 --> 00:49:30,830
<i>As the weeks wore on,</i>
<i>the groping continued.</i>

564
00:49:30,965 --> 00:49:33,490
<i>But she would never sleep with him.</i>

565
00:49:37,405 --> 00:49:40,431
- I'm just feeling like it's...
- Sorry I'm late.

566
00:49:45,579 --> 00:49:48,844
- Hi, Darius. How are you?
- Good. How are you doing?

567
00:49:51,218 --> 00:49:53,118
You sure that's what you want to do?

568
00:50:08,002 --> 00:50:10,869
You know, she's trying. She'll work on it.

569
00:50:11,305 --> 00:50:13,865
You know, it's not all her. It's me.

570
00:50:28,823 --> 00:50:32,623
<i>Thavi Matola's book was hailed</i>
<i>as a masterpiece, and sold big.</i>

571
00:50:33,027 --> 00:50:36,121
<i>Thavi thanked Greta warmly</i>
<i>in the acknowledgements.</i>

572
00:50:36,197 --> 00:50:40,395
<i>A week after the book was reviewed, Greta</i>
<i>had an offer from another publishing house.</i>

573
00:50:40,468 --> 00:50:43,232
<i>They wanted her to work</i>
<i>as one of their senior editors...</i>

574
00:50:43,304 --> 00:50:44,771
<i>for an enormous pay hike.</i>

575
00:50:44,839 --> 00:50:46,966
<i>Greta gave Gelb a chance to match it.</i>

576
00:50:47,041 --> 00:50:50,875
<i>When he balked, she took the new job,</i>
<i>and Thavi left with her.</i>

577
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,405
<i>When Greta's father</i>
<i>heard the news of her success...</i>

578
00:50:55,483 --> 00:50:57,849
<i>he insisted on throwing a party.</i>

579
00:50:58,819 --> 00:51:01,879
- Come on in, guys.
- The place looks great.

580
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:04,755
How you doing?

581
00:51:05,025 --> 00:51:06,754
- My God! How are you, man?
- Good.

582
00:51:06,827 --> 00:51:09,853
This is Chris. Greta, my wife.

583
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:13,593
- We went to college together.
- How do you know the Herskovitzes?

584
00:51:13,701 --> 00:51:17,296
- It's her dad.
- So, what's new? Where have you been?

585
00:51:17,371 --> 00:51:20,169
All is very well.
Still working hard on the dissertation.

586
00:51:20,241 --> 00:51:23,176
Hope I'm getting near
what I hope is the end.

587
00:51:30,184 --> 00:51:32,152
- Hi, Dad.
- There she is.

588
00:51:35,456 --> 00:51:37,686
- How are you?
- How you been?

589
00:51:40,327 --> 00:51:43,558
<i>She hadn't let him</i>
<i>get this close to her in years.</i>

590
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:51,270
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

591
00:51:51,338 --> 00:51:52,999
We thought we'd lost you.

592
00:51:53,541 --> 00:51:55,941
- You didn't. Hi.
- Hi, Greta.

593
00:51:56,510 --> 00:51:59,968
I remember the funniest stories
about you guys.

594
00:52:00,047 --> 00:52:02,675
You've turned into this huge success.

595
00:52:03,117 --> 00:52:05,381
Very unusual person, I imagine.

596
00:52:05,452 --> 00:52:08,717
I'm really pleased.
I had such a really interesting...

597
00:52:08,789 --> 00:52:11,485
and thrilling, challenging...

598
00:52:12,092 --> 00:52:13,582
time with Thavi.

599
00:52:13,661 --> 00:52:16,129
And I really got on top of it, you know?

600
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:19,495
I really loved it. I loved editing.

601
00:52:19,567 --> 00:52:22,331
- He sounds so interesting.
- He's so interesting.

602
00:52:31,011 --> 00:52:33,309
Darling, they're here. Come on.

603
00:52:35,783 --> 00:52:39,048
She's played dead all these years,
and now look at her.

604
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:41,952
Everyone has their own personal velocity.

605
00:52:57,571 --> 00:53:00,870
It was sweet of my dad to throw that party.

606
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:06,109
- Even though they were all his friends.
- It was fun.

607
00:53:08,315 --> 00:53:11,773
Now that you're done, maybe we can
take a long weekend somewhere.

608
00:53:14,154 --> 00:53:15,644
Sounds great.

609
00:53:20,861 --> 00:53:25,230
<i>How could he still love me?</i>
<i>If he does, it's because he doesn't know me.</i>

610
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:28,825
<i>I'm rotten with ambition, a lusty little troll...</i>

611
00:53:28,902 --> 00:53:31,496
<i>the kind of demon</i>
<i>you'd find on hell's bottom floor...</i>

612
00:53:31,572 --> 00:53:33,836
<i>pulling fingernails off the loan sharks.</i>

613
00:53:43,317 --> 00:53:45,148
<i>She tried hard to stay with it...</i>

614
00:53:45,219 --> 00:53:48,279
<i>but her mind was swarming</i>
<i>with images from the party.</i>

615
00:53:57,531 --> 00:53:59,465
<i>She couldn't help wondering if, one day...</i>

616
00:53:59,533 --> 00:54:02,024
<i>she might raise enough money</i>
<i>from her dad's friends...</i>

617
00:54:02,102 --> 00:54:04,764
<i>to start her own publishing house.</i>

618
00:54:27,294 --> 00:54:30,320
<i>The next day</i>
<i>was the first day of her new job.</i>

619

626
00:55:00,561 --> 00:55:02,256
Anything funny in the paper?

<i>Suddenly a terrible thought</i>

- All right?
- Yeah.

00:59:16,316 --> 00:59:18,876
<i>She didn't know where she was going.</i>

661
00:59:58,158 --> 01:00:01,150
- Do you want to come in?
- I guess not.

662
01:00:02,195 --> 01:00:03,992
Be back in a second.

663
01:00:22,182 --> 01:00:24,343
<i>Paula hadn't been home in two years.</i>

664
01:00:24,418 --> 01:00:28,787
<i>Since her mother got the new boyfriend,</i>
<i>and her father moved to Arizona.</i>

665
01:00:54,414 --> 01:00:56,314
Oh, my God, it is you!

666
01:00:57,217 --> 01:00:59,617
I thought I was hallucinating up there.

667
01:00:59,686 --> 01:01:01,984
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Hi, Mama.

668
01:01:02,055 --> 01:01:04,285
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

669
01:01:05,759 --> 01:01:08,956
- You want some coffee? Do you want juice?
- Juice.

670
01:01:09,029 --> 01:01:11,429
Peter's going to be down in a minute.

671
01:01:11,498 --> 01:01:13,432
Isn't he usually at work by now?

672
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:17,300
- Why didn't you call first?
- I was just stopping by. Is it okay?

673
01:01:17,370 --> 01:01:20,203
It's fine. Are you okay, are you sure?

674
01:01:20,974 --> 01:01:22,532
I'm fine.

675
01:01:24,945 --> 01:01:27,539
- Hello, Paula.
- Hello.

676
01:01:27,614 --> 01:01:29,514
You changed your hair.

677
01:01:33,553 --> 01:01:34,850
Thank you.

678
01:01:35,489 --> 01:01:38,947
- What brings you up our way?
- I came to see my mother.

679
01:01:40,427 --> 01:01:42,258
How much do you need?

680
01:01:55,408 --> 01:01:58,935
- What happened to you?
- I was in an accident.

681
01:02:00,814 --> 01:02:02,304
With the car?

682
01:02:03,016 --> 01:02:06,076
I was with this guy, and he got run over.

683
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:10,453
- Oh, my God.
- We'd just switched places.

684
01:02:11,691 --> 01:02:14,455
Sixty seconds earlier,
and it would have been me.

685
01:02:14,528 --> 01:02:16,894
Start from the beginning, honey.

686
01:02:17,764 --> 01:02:19,664
Vincent and I had had a fight.

687
01:02:22,235 --> 01:02:24,294
<i>She had just found out she was pregnant...</i>

688
01:02:24,371 --> 01:02:28,432
<i>and he came home from the Laundromat</i>
<i>with wet clothes in the hamper.</i>

689
01:02:28,508 --> 01:02:32,706
<i>The damp underwear hanging over</i>
<i>the radiators filled her with panic.</i>

690
01:02:32,879 --> 01:02:35,109
<i>She hadn't told him about the baby.</i>

691
01:02:35,182 --> 01:02:39,312
<i>She knew it would get real if she said it.</i>
<i>She didn't want it to get real.</i>

692
01:02:39,386 --> 01:02:41,684
I'd gone to a club with Fiona and Jackie.

693
01:02:47,194 --> 01:02:50,459
Don't disapprove, okay?
Because otherwise I'm not going to tell you.

694
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:51,861
I didn't say anything.

695
01:02:58,238 --> 01:03:00,399
<i>This guy offered me a drink.</i>

696
01:03:02,509 --> 01:03:04,170
<i>He had an accent.</i>

697
01:03:04,544 --> 01:03:07,479
<i>So, I asked him where he was from,</i>
<i>and he said Norway.</i>

698
01:03:07,547 --> 01:03:11,313
Said that he directed some music videos
out in LA for MTV.

699
01:03:12,586 --> 01:03:15,612
<i>There was a recognition</i>
<i>between them, tension.</i>

700
01:03:16,256 --> 01:03:20,192
<i>They were hungry for each others'</i>
<i>conversation. They talked for hours.</i>

701
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:24,026
<i>She kept wondering if he was the reason</i>
<i>why she'd come here.</i>

702
01:03:25,098 --> 01:03:28,261
I used to write. I used to paint.

703
01:03:28,868 --> 01:03:30,301
Now I'm a waitress.

704
01:03:30,370 --> 01:03:33,362
I think I'll be one of those people
with a lot of potential...

705
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:34,930
who never really takes off.

706
01:03:35,008 --> 01:03:36,532
Those are always the best people.

707
01:03:37,444 --> 01:03:40,641
And we were walking and talking...

708
01:03:40,714 --> 01:03:44,673
and this car drove by,
and muddy water splashed all over me.

709
01:03:47,087 --> 01:03:48,645
I'm sorry. My fault.

710
01:03:48,722 --> 01:03:52,920
<i>He apologized, and he said</i>
<i>that the man should walk on the outside...</i>

711
01:03:53,093 --> 01:03:56,153
so the woman doesn't get dirty.
So we switched.

712
01:03:57,397 --> 01:04:00,855
And then I heard a noise, like a shot.
I said, "Is that a shot?"

713
01:04:00,934 --> 01:04:04,700
<i>He said, "No, it's a car."</i>
<i>Then we kept walking.</i>

714
01:04:05,672 --> 01:04:10,006
And then there was a smack on my arm.
And he vaporized, next to me.

715
01:04:10,910 --> 01:04:13,674
And then I was on my face on the street.

716
01:04:14,447 --> 01:04:15,641
And...

717
01:04:16,516 --> 01:04:19,849
I sat up and I looked around, and he was...

718
01:04:20,954 --> 01:04:22,512
nowhere. And...

719
01:04:24,124 --> 01:04:27,685
there was a car at the end of the block.
It was crashed.

720
01:04:29,429 --> 01:04:33,923
And then I saw him
draped over a parking meter.

721
01:04:36,836 --> 01:04:40,966
There's cops everywhere,
and I was having trouble breathing.

722
01:04:41,274 --> 01:04:43,469
And I just took off.

723
01:04:44,377 --> 01:04:46,004
<i>I just ran away.</i>

724
01:05:09,369 --> 01:05:11,929
<i>And I got in the car. I started driving...</i>

725
01:05:12,472 --> 01:05:14,463
<i>and driving.</i>

726
01:05:17,010 --> 01:05:19,672
I don't even know what I'm doing here.

727
01:05:20,814 --> 01:05:24,250
But I know
that I'm not supposed to go home.

728
01:05:25,118 --> 01:05:28,610
What do you mean,
you're not supposed to go home?

729
01:05:30,023 --> 01:05:32,548
I want to get an underwater camera.

730
01:05:34,227 --> 01:05:35,922
I'm gonna get one.

731
01:05:36,396 --> 01:05:39,490
<i>Her mind was racing through images, ideas.</i>

732
01:05:39,966 --> 01:05:42,127
<i>She wanted to write, to paint.</i>

733
01:05:42,202 --> 01:05:44,261
<i>She had so many scattered ambitions.</i>

734
01:05:45,238 --> 01:05:47,035
<i>This was her chance.</i>

735
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:50,200
<i>She was going to make it all happen.</i>

736
01:05:50,677 --> 01:05:53,407
She's here. Hold on. It's Vincent.

737
01:05:57,417 --> 01:05:58,884
- Hi.
<i>- Paula...</i>

738
01:05:59,085 --> 01:06:01,815
<i>I called the police.</i>
<i>I have been going out of my mind.</i>

739
01:06:01,888 --> 01:06:03,082
I was going to call.

740
01:06:03,156 --> 01:06:04,646
<i>Great. Thanks.</i>

741
01:06:06,126 --> 01:06:07,616
<i>What happened?</i>

742
01:06:09,162 --> 01:06:13,565
<i>They had met two years earlier,</i>
<i>a week after she had run away from home.</i>

743
01:06:23,143 --> 01:06:25,338
You look like
you were waiting for something.

744
01:06:25,412 --> 01:06:28,279
<i>She had been, she always was.</i>

745
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:37,289
<i>That afternoon,</i>
<i>she moved into his apartment.</i>

746
01:06:38,324 --> 01:06:40,485
<i>She had no place else to go.</i>

747
01:06:44,664 --> 01:06:47,030
<i>She felt that he had been</i>
<i>drawn across the sky...</i>

748
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:49,591
<i>all the way from Haiti, to save her.</i>

749
01:06:55,141 --> 01:06:56,665
<i>A year passed.</i>

750
01:07:02,048 --> 01:07:05,313
<i>- When are you coming home?</i>
- I don't know.

751
01:07:06,453 --> 01:07:08,284
<i>I don't believe this.</i>

752
01:07:08,621 --> 01:07:10,680
- Okay.
<i>- Okay, what?</i>

753
01:07:12,158 --> 01:07:14,058
Me, too. See you later.

754
01:07:15,361 --> 01:07:17,056
I'll see you soon.

755
01:07:21,468 --> 01:07:23,527
Who's the kid in the car?

756
01:07:24,037 --> 01:07:25,698
He needed a ride.

757
01:07:27,474 --> 01:07:30,102
- You picked up some strange kid?
- Yes.

758
01:07:30,844 --> 01:07:34,541
- Maybe he's cold.
- I left the engine running.

759
01:07:34,614 --> 01:07:36,980
She left the keys in the car
with some runaway.

760
01:07:37,050 --> 01:07:38,142
That's not safe...

761
01:07:38,251 --> 01:07:40,242
- I'm going to work.
- Okay.

762
01:07:40,887 --> 01:07:43,185
You probably won't be here when I get back.

763
01:07:43,256 --> 01:07:44,883
I'll say good-bye now.

764
01:07:46,693 --> 01:07:50,254
He's just like Dad, only he's uglier.

765
01:07:51,631 --> 01:07:53,565
You make him defensive.

766
01:07:59,506 --> 01:08:00,996
I'm pregnant.

767
01:08:02,842 --> 01:08:05,208
I'm not going to keep it, though.

768
01:08:06,746 --> 01:08:08,509
What are you doing?

769
01:08:10,083 --> 01:08:11,675
How pregnant?

770
01:08:11,751 --> 01:08:15,414
<i>She could feel the thing inside her,</i>
<i>an ache without pain.</i>

771
01:08:15,922 --> 01:08:19,414
<i>She imagined it sucking the seconds</i>
<i>out of her life, as it built itself...</i>

772
01:08:19,492 --> 01:08:21,756
<i>cell by cell, devouring.</i>

773
01:08:23,463 --> 01:08:24,452
Hello.

774
01:08:24,531 --> 01:08:26,158
No, Vincent, you know<i>...</i>

775
01:08:26,533 --> 01:08:28,194
No, I don't know.

776
01:08:34,607 --> 01:08:35,869
Hold on.

777
01:08:45,251 --> 01:08:46,775
Don't do this!

778
01:09:31,464 --> 01:09:33,728
Okay, it's time for you to go.

779
01:09:35,301 --> 01:09:37,735
I'm going to give you some money.

780
01:09:37,971 --> 01:09:39,836
Here's $30. Good luck.

781
01:09:41,341 --> 01:09:43,275
Do you got anywhere to go?

782
01:09:44,143 --> 01:09:45,440
My uncle.

783
01:09:47,347 --> 01:09:50,111
You've been a great traveling companion.

784
01:09:52,852 --> 01:09:54,251
Oh, my God.

785
01:09:59,225 --> 01:10:01,693
<i>She saw the edge of a wound, bruises.</i>

786
01:10:01,761 --> 01:10:03,752
We're going to the hospital. That's it.

787
01:10:03,830 --> 01:10:04,854
Wait!

788
01:10:06,766 --> 01:10:08,256
Get back here.

789
01:10:08,835 --> 01:10:09,927
Wait!

790
01:10:10,536 --> 01:10:11,969
Please stop!

791
01:10:16,776 --> 01:10:18,107
I'm sorry.

792
01:10:20,613 --> 01:10:23,514
We don't have to go to the hospital, okay?
I promise.

793
01:10:23,583 --> 01:10:25,517
We'll go to a pharmacy.

794
01:10:25,585 --> 01:10:29,043
We'll just get some disinfectant
and some gauze, okay?

795
01:10:29,722 --> 01:10:31,883
And then I'll let you go on your way.

796
01:10:31,958 --> 01:10:34,017
Stay calm. It's okay. I'm sorry.

797
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:35,718
Did I hurt you?

798
01:10:37,864 --> 01:10:39,889
Come on. Let's go back to the car.

799
01:10:42,669 --> 01:10:44,000
I'm sorry.

800
01:11:13,399 --> 01:11:14,525
Wait.

801
01:11:15,902 --> 01:11:17,460
Can I help you?

802
01:11:19,005 --> 01:11:21,166
- Paula Friedrich.
- Hi, Mrs. Toron.

803
01:11:21,274 --> 01:11:24,607
It's been ages.
You're in Manhattan now, aren't you?

804
01:11:25,912 --> 01:11:29,814
I assumed you were off at college,
but your mother said you were in the city.

805
01:11:29,882 --> 01:11:32,749
- Yes, ma'am.
- Wesley's a senior at Syracuse.

806
01:11:32,819 --> 01:11:34,480
That's great.

807
01:11:35,288 --> 01:11:38,519
Listen, I'm sorry.
I'm really in a bit of a hurry.

808
01:11:38,991 --> 01:11:40,583
I'm looking for some...

809
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:43,629
disinfecting gel, antibacterial.

810
01:11:43,696 --> 01:11:46,324
I think I can rummage that up.

811
01:11:48,501 --> 01:11:49,866
Thank you.

812
01:12:03,549 --> 01:12:06,279
- Do you need anything else?
- No, thanks.

813
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:10,318
- How much do I owe you?
- Just go.

814
01:12:10,623 --> 01:12:11,988
Thank you.

815
01:12:48,561 --> 01:12:49,858
Sit down.

816
01:13:00,273 --> 01:13:02,036
Where are you hurt?

817
01:13:04,610 --> 01:13:05,907
All over.

818
01:13:11,117 --> 01:13:14,052
Listen, I'm sorry I have to do this...

819
01:13:14,153 --> 01:13:18,021
but if I don't disinfect those cuts,
they're going to get infected.

820
01:13:32,605 --> 01:13:33,731
Here.

821
01:14:17,617 --> 01:14:18,982
I'm sorry.

822
01:14:23,256 --> 01:14:24,951
Deep breath, okay?

823
01:14:30,563 --> 01:14:31,928
I'm sorry.

824
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:41,766
Okay.

825
01:14:48,581 --> 01:14:49,843
Almost there.

826
01:16:02,254 --> 01:16:04,381
<i>- Yes?</i>
- It's me.

827
01:16:05,891 --> 01:16:07,415
<i>Where are you?</i>

828
01:16:07,927 --> 01:16:10,395
- I'm in a hotel.
<i>- What's the problem?</i>

829
01:16:12,865 --> 01:16:14,355
I don't know.

830
01:16:15,735 --> 01:16:20,104
I was driving down the road,
and there was this boy on the road.

831
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:23,235
He looked so cold.

832
01:16:25,311 --> 01:16:26,938
I picked him up.

833
01:16:28,681 --> 01:16:31,616
And I found out he was really badly beaten.

834
01:16:32,251 --> 01:16:34,242
<i>What do you mean, beaten?</i>

835
01:16:36,889 --> 01:16:40,757
It looks like somebody
tied him to something, and tortured him.

836
01:16:43,429 --> 01:16:44,794
It's so awful.

837
01:16:45,564 --> 01:16:48,795
<i>So you're in a motel with this kid?</i>

838
01:16:50,269 --> 01:16:52,965
Yeah. I had to help him.

839
01:16:57,843 --> 01:17:02,542
He doesn't have anywhere to go.
He's just a baby, Vincent.

840
01:17:04,984 --> 01:17:06,918
Can't we take him home?

841
01:17:07,753 --> 01:17:10,119
Just back to Brooklyn, just for a little while?

842
01:17:10,189 --> 01:17:12,657
<i>Are you crazy? We've got no space.</i>

843
01:17:13,759 --> 01:17:16,421
<i>- You don't know this kid.</i>
- Please.

844
01:17:17,363 --> 01:17:18,887
Please, honey.

845
01:17:20,399 --> 01:17:23,368
Don't make me leave him here. I can't do it.

846
01:17:29,542 --> 01:17:30,907
I'm sorry.

847
01:17:33,979 --> 01:17:35,503
Baby, listen...

848
01:17:36,549 --> 01:17:38,278
something happened.

849
01:17:41,787 --> 01:17:45,450
I was with this guy, and he got hit by a car.

850
01:17:46,025 --> 01:17:49,358
- We'd just traded places.
<i>- Your mother just told me.</i>

851
01:17:50,429 --> 01:17:52,260
I don't know what all of this means...

852
01:17:52,331 --> 01:17:55,630
but it's got to mean something,
don't you see that?

853
01:17:56,235 --> 01:17:59,534
If he hadn't been with me,
he wouldn't be dead.

854
01:18:03,642 --> 01:18:05,166
It makes sense.

855
01:18:05,845 --> 01:18:07,745
It's gotta be a sign.

856
01:18:14,687 --> 01:18:17,554
- I don't know.
<i>- Bring the kid.</i>

857
01:18:19,325 --> 01:18:22,351
<i>He can stay with us. We'll take care of him.</i>

858
01:18:22,561 --> 01:18:24,085
<i>Just come home.</i>

859
01:18:24,530 --> 01:18:27,124
<i>Please, come home.</i>

860
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:31,301
<i>And take a train.</i>
<i>I don't want you to drive like this.</i>

861
01:18:34,006 --> 01:18:35,337
Thank you.

862
01:18:35,841 --> 01:18:37,502
Thank you so much.

863
01:19:15,848 --> 01:19:18,180
I talked to my boyfriend.

864
01:19:18,484 --> 01:19:22,682
He said that it's fine if you want to come
and stay with us in Brooklyn for a while...

865
01:19:22,755 --> 01:19:24,552
till you get better.

866
01:19:24,823 --> 01:19:28,054
You know,
till we figure out something to do.

867
01:19:28,994 --> 01:19:33,021
I'm way too tired to drive.
So, we'll take a train, okay?

868
01:19:34,967 --> 01:19:37,094
I'm going to live with you?

869
01:19:38,337 --> 01:19:42,103
Just for a little while, I mean,
with me and my boyfriend...

870
01:19:42,174 --> 01:19:44,165
until we sort stuff out.

871
01:19:53,185 --> 01:19:56,882
What do you want for lunch?
I'm going to get an egg sandwich.

872
01:19:56,956 --> 01:20:00,050
I don't think
I'm going to have lunch just now.

873
01:20:01,961 --> 01:20:03,087
Okay.

874
01:20:06,198 --> 01:20:07,756
Think about it.

875
01:20:11,036 --> 01:20:13,971
I'll pick you up an egg sandwich for later.

876
01:20:44,603 --> 01:20:45,729
What?

877
01:20:46,839 --> 01:20:48,466
You little shit!

878
01:20:50,476 --> 01:20:54,207
- You want me to call the police?
- No, I know him.

879
01:20:57,349 --> 01:20:58,475
Shit!

880
01:21:48,467 --> 01:21:51,402
Can you tell me
how to get to the train station from here?

881
01:21:51,503 --> 01:21:54,734
Sure. Make a right here,
and then go down to the end of the road...

882
01:21:54,807 --> 01:21:56,172
and it's right there.

883
01:21:56,241 --> 01:21:57,868
Okay. Thank you.
