But not as hot as
these phone lines.

And what are you

72
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:06,520
[TK] Hello.

73
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:07,554
What's going on?

74
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,324
My name is TK.

75
00:03:10,358 --> 00:03:12,760
I want to speak about females.

76
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:15,429
[DJ Rain] Well, first let's
learn the proper term, my man.

77
00:03:15,463 --> 00:03:17,197
Female is an adjective.

78
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:18,866
Woman is a noun.

79
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:20,901
So they're not
females, they're women.

80
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:23,804
[TK] Females.

81
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,473
Women.

82
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:27,174
A little but they
are all confusing.

83
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:29,943
Anyway,

84
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:32,079
I asked my lady what she
wanna do for her birthday.

85
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:34,147
She said nothing.

86
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:36,417
That's exactly what I did.

87
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:40,621
Nothing, that's all I want
to talk to you brother.

88
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:41,822
Alright, TK.

89
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:43,457
I'm going to keep
it a book with you.

90
00:03:43,491 --> 00:03:46,026
It sounded like you fell
for the age old trick.

91
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,429
When a woman says she was
nothing on her birthday,

92
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:49,739
what she's really
saying is that,

93
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,599
even though she
doesn't want anything,

94
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:52,566
just didn't want you to
show her that you love

95
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,402
and that you appreciate her,

96
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,471
even if she's not
particularly expect me,

97
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,375
it sounds like you've got
some making up to do my man.

98
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:02,449

I know this really isn't

Bro,

167
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:08,061
I know you're hurting right now,

168
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:13,867
we're going to look back at
this moment and just laugh,

you see what I'm saying?

170
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,273
And today is not that great.

171
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:21,108

but today is actually the
best day of your life.

Was she at the same
party we were at today.

176

I say that,

177
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:38,992
because now is the time
that you can truly find

178
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:43,030
yourself and now you
can truly figure out,

what you really
want in a partner.

180
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:46,600
And when you figured that out,

181
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:48,802
the right one would
be right there.

00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:55,809
Give me that phone.

186
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:56,910
Baby,

187
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:58,579
please don't leave me.

188
00:07:58,612 --> 00:07:59,412
Baby look,

189
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:00,614
I need you.

190
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:01,582
Like I'm begging
like (indistinct).

191
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:02,482
Baby please don't leave me.

192
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:03,784
What do you want me to do?

193
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,319
I'll do,

194
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:07,621
I'll do anything that you like.

195
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:08,522
Ooh.

196
00:08:08,556 --> 00:08:09,456
Just please don't leave me.

197
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,323
Get that phone..

198
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:11,892
Please.

199
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:12,760
Oh, girl.

200
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:14,261
(crying)

201
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:15,529
Give me that phone.

202
00:08:15,563 --> 00:08:16,773
Why can't you just
ope your phone man.

203
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:18,498
Now it's time
to call the night.

204
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:20,000
Look, I need that.

205
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,201
I need to drive my pain away.

206
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,570
Just give me the phone.

207
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:23,403
Let's go.

208
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:24,436
Calm down,

209
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:26,438
it's okay.

210
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:28,542
(sighs).

211
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:29,576
Damn.

212
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:32,613
Feel bad for him.

213
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,414
He is sad.

214
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:35,248
Yeah,

215
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:36,282
me too.

216
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,351
Is this okay now?

217
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,355
Come on man.

218
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:49,062
(soft piano music)

219
00:08:54,602 --> 00:08:55,736
No.

220
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,571
Do you have anything?

221
00:08:57,605 --> 00:08:59,006
Okay, all right.

222
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:03,276
(sighs)

223
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:12,752
Yap.

224
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:15,856
I just wish,

225
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:19,426
I just wish that
women be like you.

226
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,067
Not with him but me.

227
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,138
Always,

228
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:32,606
always there for me.

229
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,276
Love me no matter what.

230
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:46,053
(crying)

231
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:51,191
Why did she say no?

232
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,594
Why did she say no to me?

233
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:57,264
She probably,

234
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:00,668
she probably realized that,

235
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:09,042
that she wasn't the
right one for you.

236
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:14,281
When I know I might
seem like you now, but

237
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:18,752
Simone did you a favor.

238
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:23,156
She released you
to find the woman

239
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,558
that God created just for you.

240
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,700
You are one of the most kindest,

241
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:33,733
the sweetest,

242
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:37,570
most loving people
I have ever known.

243
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:39,707
(chuckles)

244
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,810
I remember when we
were in second grade

245
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:46,179
and I accidentally got
glue stuck in my hair

246
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:48,615
and you thought it
would be a good idea

247
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,583
to try and cut it out.

248
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:54,521
Leaving a big ass
hole in my head.

249
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:56,724
(chuckles)

250
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:58,425
Man, I was so mad,

251
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,362
but what did you do?

252
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:05,999
You let me cut a big
hole in you hair,

253
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:07,100
so we be even.

254
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:11,138
(sighs)

255
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:13,741
You are good man.

256
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:17,811
And you deserve to have
a good woman to love you.

257
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:21,448
Like you deserve to be loved.

258
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:22,282
Okay.

259
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:24,484
(snores)

260
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:35,729
Goodnight friend.

261
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:40,467
(snores)

262
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:12,032
(door closes)

263
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:36,188
Damn.

264
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:39,459
What did I drink?

265
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:43,997
(chuckles)

266
00:12:44,031 --> 00:12:47,935
Hey, baby you'll never believe
the dream I had last night.

267
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:49,602
I dreamt I proposed
to you and you,

268
00:12:54,842 --> 00:12:55,842
said no.

269
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:11,825
(sighs)

270
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,333
One more tequila for me.

271
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:22,635
(rock music)

272
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:26,940

I heard it was awful.

299
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:05,772
Turn him down flat in
front of everybody.

300
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:07,474
So it's probably safe to assume

301
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:09,576
that maybe Zack
would be here today.

302
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:10,978
So my have you feeling.

303
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:12,946
Rain?

304
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:18,717
Yes boss.

305
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:20,920
What are you doing here?

306
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:23,823
I have a show
to get ready for.

307
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:24,724
I mean,

308
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,027
after last night I just assumed.

309
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,261
(chuckles) Well,

310
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:29,096
you know what they say
about people who assume,

311
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:30,129
right?

312
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,701
And I'm not gonna say

313
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:37,904
cause the boss trying
to kill this job always.

314
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:38,738
Look,

315
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,207
Rain.

316
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,609
Are you sure where you
should be here right now?

317
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:43,443
I mean,

318
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:45,078
after what happened,

319
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:46,813
maybe you should
take a few days off.

320
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:48,081
Look boss.

321
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:49,816
I appreciate you
looking out for me.

322
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:51,618
The bills still got to get paid.

323
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:53,353
And love and heartbreak.

324
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:54,287
Ain't gonna pay the bills.

325
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:55,321
You feel me?

326
00:15:58,325 --> 00:15:59,392
Now, if you excuse me.

327
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,029
I have a show to get ready for.

328
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:07,100
(upbeat music)

329
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,107
Yeah,

330
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:15,575
that was a throwback
during the day.

331
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:17,186
And now it's time everybody
to think for a second.

332
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,778
Speak out.

333
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,456
This is your chance to
speak about anything

334
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,781
you want to.

335
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,317
Nothing or no one is off limits.

336
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:25,985
So with that being said.

337
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:27,354
[DJ Rain] Let's have first call.

338
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:31,624
Welcome to the afternoon
drive with DJ Rain live.

339
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:32,825
Who am I speaking with?

340
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:34,694
[Portia] My name is Portia.

341
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,396
[DJ Rain] Yo,
what's good Portia?

342
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,265
What are you speaking
out about today?

343
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:39,866
[Portia] Well Rain,

344
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:43,236
I've been dating my boyfriend
for about four years now

345
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,905
and he just recently
asked me to marry him,

346
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:49,076
but I haven't given
him an answer yet.

347
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:49,909
I mean,

348
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:51,444
I love him,

349
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:54,247
but I just don't think we're
ready to get married yet.

350
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:55,082
Oh,

351
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:56,115
damn.

352
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:58,851
What do you mean?

353
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:00,063
You don't know if you're
ready to get married yet?

354
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:01,488
You've been together
for four years.

355
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,190
How much more time do you need?

356
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:06,426
[Portia] I just want to make
sure before I made that leap,

357
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:07,927
you know what I'm saying?

358
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,405
[DJ Rain] No, I don't
know what you're saying.

359
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:10,230
I need to talk to you
about this account man.

360
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:11,498
Hey man,

361
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:12,399
don't you see I'm
doing something.

362
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:13,200
[DJ Rain] Sounds like me,

363
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:14,767
(indistinct) mans heart.

364
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:16,269
You just (indistinct)
big let down,

365
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:18,205
and a major heartbreak.

366
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:19,406
You know what?

367
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,774
It's bitches like you to
get in my damn nerves.

368
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:23,009
You got a good man,

369
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,577
but instead taking
a live with him

370
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:27,280
you just decide to throw him
away like he ain't nothing.

371
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:28,791
How about you just do
everybody else a favor

372
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:31,017
and find the nearest
cliff and take that leap.

373
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:33,953
Hello?

374
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:34,787
Hello?

375
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:35,821
Damn Rain.

376
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:37,757
Yes, you hung up.

377
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:42,028
I guess the truth just
got too real for her ass.

378
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,263
Listen,

379
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:45,265
it's time to have a music break.

380
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:46,199
And I know we supposed to play

381
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:47,700
some more Christmas music but

382
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:50,870
if I get my jingle bell
right and nobody else did.

383
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,605
So with that being said,

384
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,083
this next genre is
dedicated to all you

385
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:56,243
whore whore out there.

386
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:58,187
Especially the ones who decide
to leave a good man during

387
00:17:58,211 --> 00:17:59,211
the holiday season.

388
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,250
You know after this genre
we go follow up Chris Brown.

389
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:04,484
This hoes ain't loyal.

390
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:05,517
'Cause they ain't.

391
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,720
Oh, yeah.

392
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,722
It's getting really
up in this bitch.

393
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:12,425
(phone vibrates)

394
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:18,897
Hello?

395
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:23,136
Yeah.

396
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,170
I heard the show.

397
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:29,242
What are we going to do now?

398
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:32,111
(soft piano music)

399
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:37,684
Jimmy just continue to
apologize to the listeners

400
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:40,253
and let them know that we
are handling the situation.

401
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:43,323
(man knocking at the door)

402
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:44,356
Come in.

403
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:48,026
Thanks Jemmy.

404
00:18:50,197 --> 00:18:51,531
Have a seat.

405
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:52,699
I'm good standing.

406
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:54,733
Fine.

407
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,104
Have you lost your damn mind?

408
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:01,608
Who the hell are
you to be going on

409
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,009
live like that on the radio?

410
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,246
And because of your shit,

411
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:09,516
our phones are blowing up
with offended listeners.

412
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:11,818
Plus I got the
FCC on my ass now.

413
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,356
What do you have to
say for yourself?

414
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:18,191
And look women are bitches.

415
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:20,360
Okay.

416
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:21,428
And bitches are evil.

417
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:26,866
I understand you're
dealing with your heartbreak.

418
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:30,136
I told you to take
a few days off.

419
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,806
But you were insisting
on not doing so.

420
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:36,909
So with that,

421
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:38,945
you should have checked
that shit at the door

422
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:40,480
before you got on the air.

423
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:45,385
I'm sorry.

424
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:46,953
So am I.

425
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:49,489
That's why I'm going to have
to suspend you indefinitely.

426
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:52,492
Without pay,

427
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,727
until we decide if we
want to keep you or not.

428
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:56,229
Look, you can't do that.

429
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:57,564
Okay, I have a contract.

430
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,234
If you read page three,

431
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:03,270
paragraph four,

432
00:20:05,272 --> 00:20:07,240
you'll see that I am
in every legal right

433
00:20:07,274 --> 00:20:08,975
to do what I just did.

434
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:24,957
(object thumps)

435
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:27,760
(soft piano music)

436
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,098
(sighs) Poor Rain.

437
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:08,601
I can't believe he went
off the rails like that.

438
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:09,902
I know right?

439
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:11,304
He should do that more often.

440
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:13,806
'Cause that was one
of his best shows yet.

441
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:20,179
I mean poor, poor, Rain?

442
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,113
You know,

443
00:21:21,147 --> 00:21:22,615
I blame Simone for all of this.

444
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:24,727
I should go to her house and
bump that half in the face

445
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:25,552
of what she did to my...

446
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:26,553
Your,

447
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:27,720
your what?

448
00:21:27,754 --> 00:21:29,155
Friend,

449
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:30,623
friend.

450
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:31,734
That's what I was getting
ready to say before you rudely

451
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:32,758
interrupted me,

452
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,228
Listen, girl bye.

453
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:38,030
Instead of trying
to fight Simone

454
00:21:38,064 --> 00:21:39,532
and catch a case,

455
00:21:39,566 --> 00:21:42,569
you need to be taken all
of that pent up aggression

456
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:44,704
and putting it on Rain.

457
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:45,938
Caroline, stop it.

458
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:49,241
I told you Rain
and I are just...

459
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:50,419
- Just friends.
- Just friends.

460
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:51,978
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

461
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:54,947
Save it for somebody with baby
milk still on their bread.

462
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:56,182
Girl,

463
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:57,460
I could tell you
got a bang for Rain

464
00:21:57,484 --> 00:22:00,987
and anyone who has eyes
can tell that you two

465
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,288
have a connection.

466
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,999
Well clearly I need
to get my eyes checked

467
00:22:04,023 --> 00:22:06,058
because Rain doesn't
see me like that.

468
00:22:06,092 --> 00:22:06,893
Alexandria.

469
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:07,994
See that's the thing,

470
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:09,762
Rain doesn't see
me as Alexandra,

471
00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:10,930
to him Aj.

472
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:12,198
I mean we grew up together.

473
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:14,401
I'm always around him
and his male friends.

474
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:18,070
So, to Rain I'm just
one of the fellows.

475
00:22:18,104 --> 00:22:22,241
Well maybe if you stop
acting like one of the fellows,

476
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:25,144
he'll take the scales off
his eyes and finally see you

477
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,613
as the woman of his dreams.

478
00:22:31,484 --> 00:22:32,652
(sighs)

479
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:35,021

480
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,974
♪ Sleepless nights,

481
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:55,942
♪ Hell of a time,

(music continues)

489
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:58,224
Good game fellows.

490
00:25:58,257 --> 00:25:59,358
Yeah.

491
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,693
Woo.

492
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:01,727
Yeah.

493
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,931
And Aj.

494
00:26:04,964 --> 00:26:08,000
(chuckles)

495
00:26:08,034 --> 00:26:11,971
Has anybody had from Rain
since the proposal hit.

496
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:14,040
He hasn't been answering
my calls or text.

497
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,474
Yeah, mine either.

498
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:17,576
Well I went to spy after
he had that melt down

499
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:18,978
on the radio last week.

500
00:26:19,979 --> 00:26:21,580
He's a complete wreck.

501
00:26:21,614 --> 00:26:22,849
Oh, how bad is he?

502
00:26:24,651 --> 00:26:25,885
It's so bad.

503
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,062
Rain is looking for
somewhere else to stay.

504
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:28,320
(chuckles)

505
00:26:28,354 --> 00:26:30,156
We gotta do something.

506
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:31,466
What do you
think we should do?

507
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,993
Okay, what I think
that we should probably.

508
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:35,494
I mean,

509
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,205
I think we should set them
up on a whole bunch of dates.

510
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:39,098
That's not the route
that I was particularly

511
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:41,000
thinking about taking.

512
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:42,201
I mean,

513
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:43,202
they say the best way
to get over someone

514
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:45,237
is to get into someone.

515
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:46,138
Yeah.

516
00:26:46,172 --> 00:26:48,040
(chuckles)

517
00:26:48,074 --> 00:26:49,408
Yeah,

518
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,242
yeah.

519
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:51,477
I mean,

520
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:54,513
we should each find a
woman that he liked.

521
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:57,950
He'd go out with a
different woman each night.

522
00:26:57,984 --> 00:27:00,319
I mean he's bound to
find one of he liked,

523
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:01,120
right?

524
00:27:01,153 --> 00:27:02,321
Yeah.

525
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:04,356
I think this could be
super clutch because of.

526
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:05,692
Hey, let's do it.

527
00:27:05,725 --> 00:27:08,494
I mean, come on fellows.

528
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:10,362
Rain has been truly
broken up by all of this

529
00:27:10,396 --> 00:27:12,699
and she just pushed
him off on some random,

530
00:27:12,732 --> 00:27:15,567
is not going to automatically
fix the situation.

531
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:17,069
I mean,

532
00:27:17,103 --> 00:27:18,103
I mean,

533
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:21,774
maybe we should think about
taking a different approach.

534
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:24,542
Come on.

535
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:27,646
- No.
- No.

536
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,948
No, I like this.

537
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:31,450
Hey, hey operation
lady in the streets

538
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,119
and freaking the
sheets on three.

539
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:34,286
Hey.

540
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,154
- Freaking the (indistinct).
- One.

541
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:36,155
- Two.
- Two.

542
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:36,989
Three.

543
00:27:37,023 --> 00:27:37,824
Three.

544
00:27:37,857 --> 00:27:39,058
Lady in the street.

545
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:41,694
Lady in the street. (mumbles)

546
00:27:41,728 --> 00:27:43,662
No, look man.

547
00:27:43,696 --> 00:27:45,040
We probably should've
came up with something

548
00:27:45,064 --> 00:27:45,865
a little shorter.

549
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:47,066
Dad is saying.

550
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:50,970
It's lady in the
streets and freaks.

551
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:51,904
I mean ain't my fault.

552
00:27:51,938 --> 00:27:53,873
Y'all know how to talk.

553
00:27:53,906 --> 00:27:56,175
(rock music)

554
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,187
♪ Lady,

555
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,889
♪ Have I told you,

556

00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:42,701
Oh, and this is my
princess Corona B.

747
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:43,635
Now she's my heart.

748
00:36:43,669 --> 00:36:45,271
She really looked like me.

749
00:36:45,304 --> 00:36:46,505
People think we are twins.

750
00:36:56,848 --> 00:36:59,985
(foreign language).

751
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,358
(chuckles)

752
00:37:14,132 --> 00:37:15,233
Oh, my God!

753
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,938
There are aliens among us.

754
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:28,213
Do you wanna know how I know?

755
00:37:29,381 --> 00:37:30,701
Now tell me when
they abducted me?

756
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,861
I told him,

757
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:44,930
if you ever cheat on me.

758
00:37:45,864 --> 00:37:46,864
I will kill you.

759
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:49,134
So that's what I did.

760
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:51,937
Well, almost.

761
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,809
Okay.

762
00:37:57,843 --> 00:37:59,277
And these are my twin boys,

763
00:37:59,311 --> 00:38:01,279
Dallas and Dynasty.

764
00:38:01,313 --> 00:38:02,614
They look like their daddy,

765
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:03,982
but they still cute though.

766
00:38:08,654 --> 00:38:09,654
Do you here that?

767
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:13,023
No, I don't.

768
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:16,328
What did you say?

769
00:38:16,362 --> 00:38:17,363
Did you say something?

770
00:38:18,564 --> 00:38:19,565
I said no,

771
00:38:19,598 --> 00:38:20,666
I don't.

772
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:21,699
No, not you.

773
00:38:25,404 --> 00:38:26,505
I'm talking to him.

774
00:38:31,276 --> 00:38:32,478
Why did you say?

775
00:38:42,521 --> 00:38:43,689
They told me,

776
00:38:44,856 --> 00:38:47,393
that I was only
a centimeter away

777
00:38:48,627 --> 00:38:50,596
from stubbing him in the heart.

778
00:38:52,464 --> 00:38:54,733
(chuckles)

779
00:39:02,408 --> 00:39:03,709
It's so so clear.

780
00:39:03,742 --> 00:39:06,011
Everything is right here.

781
00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:08,780
Do you want to know
what your future holds?

782
00:39:08,814 --> 00:39:09,948
Yeah.

783
00:39:09,981 --> 00:39:11,016
Tell me this.

784
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:12,651
Is it gonna be over?

785
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:21,993
This is the first
nanogram of my (indistinct).

786
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:23,061
What?

787
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:24,262
Yeah,

788
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:26,007
me and the baby we don't
get a long so well.

789
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:27,866
But you look like a good daddy.

790
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:29,300
Do you have any kids?

791
00:39:29,334 --> 00:39:31,503
(coughs)

792
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:36,241
(sighs)

793
00:39:37,142 --> 00:39:38,276
Yes,

794
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:39,309
he is cute.

795
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:42,414
I think he might be the one.

796
00:39:42,448 --> 00:39:43,448
Check please.

797
00:39:43,982 --> 00:39:45,651
Yes,

798
00:39:45,684 --> 00:39:48,520
(indistinct).
Just bring the check.

799
00:39:48,554 --> 00:39:49,554
No,

800
00:39:50,689 --> 00:39:52,057
okay.

801
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,191
Yes,

802
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,224
yes.

803
00:39:59,064 --> 00:39:59,998
(laughs).

804
00:40:00,031 --> 00:40:01,031
Yes.

805
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,368
Yes.

806
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,401
Yes.

807
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:07,272
Obviously, not a good idea.

808
00:40:08,774 --> 00:40:10,776
See, I told you.

809
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:11,610
You did.

810
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:13,945
So what do we do now?

811
00:40:13,979 --> 00:40:15,146
I don't know.

812
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,458
Don't look at me.
(phone vibrates)

813
00:40:16,482 --> 00:40:17,315
Listen to me.

814
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:18,283
I'm ready to listen.

815
00:40:18,316 --> 00:40:19,150
I'm not saying anything.

816
00:40:19,184 --> 00:40:20,652
- What you got?
- Nothing,

817
00:40:20,686 --> 00:40:22,488
it doesn't even matter.

818
00:40:22,521 --> 00:40:23,489
I'm listening,

819
00:40:23,522 --> 00:40:24,523
what you got.

820
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:26,124
Too late.

821
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:27,493
I have what y'all hear before.

822
00:40:27,526 --> 00:40:28,727
Nothing.

823
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,095
- Come on, now.
- Absolutely not.

824
00:40:31,396 --> 00:40:32,263
What you got?

825
00:40:32,297 --> 00:40:33,765
Nothing.

826
00:40:33,799 --> 00:40:35,667
Damn nosy.

827
00:40:35,701 --> 00:40:37,068
Oh, who was that?

828
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:38,704
Come on bro.

829
00:40:38,737 --> 00:40:40,572
That's one of hoes?

830
00:40:40,606 --> 00:40:41,439
Dude.

831
00:40:41,473 --> 00:40:43,408
I'm standing right here.

832
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,943
What's your point?

833
00:40:44,976 --> 00:40:46,277
Show some respect.

834
00:40:46,311 --> 00:40:47,479
Ass hole.

835
00:40:47,513 --> 00:40:48,847
Hey yo, listen.

836
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,116
We'll figure this whole
thing out with Rain.

837
00:40:51,149 --> 00:40:51,950
I got to go.

838
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:52,784
All right.

839
00:40:52,818 --> 00:40:53,952
Well I'm.

840
00:40:53,985 --> 00:40:54,986
Hey, hey man.

841
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,688
Hold on man you my ride man.

842
00:40:56,722 --> 00:40:57,856
Figure that out.

843
00:40:57,889 --> 00:41:00,526
This mother fucker,
figure it out.

844
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:03,094
(indistinct chattering)

845
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:04,329
I'm not riding with you.

846
00:41:04,362 --> 00:41:05,362
Come on man.

847
00:41:08,266 --> 00:41:09,267
(indistinct).

848
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,402
Do you want some respect?

849
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:15,106
(bell rings)

850
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,446
(door opens)

851
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,447
Hey you.

852
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,481
Good morning Aj.

853
00:41:23,515 --> 00:41:24,515
You tell me.

854
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,218
So,

855
00:41:27,252 --> 00:41:30,221
how were your
(indistinct) dates?

856
00:41:30,255 --> 00:41:31,790
Who?

857
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:33,859
Can't believe I let you'll
put me through that.

858
00:41:33,892 --> 00:41:35,160
It wasn't me.

859
00:41:35,193 --> 00:41:36,862
It was those local
friends of yours.

860
00:41:36,895 --> 00:41:37,863
(indistinct) talk
specifically to them.

861
00:41:37,896 --> 00:41:39,097
I tried to.

862
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,932
But those fools ain't
listening to me.

863
00:41:42,033 --> 00:41:43,068
Yeah.

864
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:44,101
You right.

865
00:41:49,608 --> 00:41:53,444
Let me keep it brief AJ.

866
00:41:53,478 --> 00:41:55,647
Every time I breath,

867
00:41:55,681 --> 00:41:56,681
I see you.

868
00:41:58,483 --> 00:41:59,517
I don't know.

869
00:42:00,919 --> 00:42:01,919
I don't know.

870
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:07,525
It's been three years
with that woman.

871
00:42:08,627 --> 00:42:11,062
I gave her my heart and my soul.

872
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:15,967
It's like,

873
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:18,837
it's like she inhabits
every cell in my body.

874
00:42:24,009 --> 00:42:25,944
(sighs)

875
00:42:25,977 --> 00:42:27,646
I don't know.

876
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:28,679
I don't know.

877
00:42:29,981 --> 00:42:31,617
It's like,

878
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:34,720
it's like I feel less of a man.

879
00:42:34,753 --> 00:42:35,753
I feel empty.

880
00:42:39,524 --> 00:42:40,692
I ain't complete.

881
00:42:42,694 --> 00:42:43,694
Simone,

882
00:42:45,731 --> 00:42:46,732
she's my everything.

883
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,802
She's perfect.

884
00:42:50,836 --> 00:42:52,938
Obviously she must
not be too perfectly.

885
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:54,205
Don't you like that?

886
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:55,540
No Aj I'm not trying to get.

887
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:56,374
No,

888
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:57,407
no.

889
00:42:58,476 --> 00:43:00,178
Now you listen,

890
00:43:00,211 --> 00:43:01,647
and I know you loved this woman.

891
00:43:04,115 --> 00:43:05,651
And I know you put
a lot of your heart

892
00:43:05,684 --> 00:43:07,152
and your time in
this relationship.

893
00:43:07,185 --> 00:43:10,321
And I understand that it's going
to take a minute for you to

894
00:43:10,355 --> 00:43:11,356
heal from all this

895
00:43:12,557 --> 00:43:14,359
but you can't let
her make you feel

896
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,428
like you are less
than who you are.

897
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:20,732
Less than what you deserve.

898
00:43:23,501 --> 00:43:25,804
You are a strong,

899
00:43:25,837 --> 00:43:27,138
smart,

900
00:43:27,172 --> 00:43:28,339
black king.

901
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,210
And if she can't see that,

902
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:37,115
then she doesn't deserve you.

903
00:43:37,148 --> 00:43:38,148
Damn.

904
00:43:39,317 --> 00:43:41,787
I think this is the nicest
thing you ever said about me.

905
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,321
Don't be used to it.

906
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:45,156
(chuckles)

907
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:48,026
But now for real take your time.

908
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:51,730
The right woman will be with
you when the time is right.

909
00:43:51,763 --> 00:43:52,931
And who knows.

910
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,504
She might be right
under your nose.

911
00:44:08,046 --> 00:44:10,448
Why are you looking
at me like that?

912
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:11,950
I got a bug in my nose?

913
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:12,784
Ew.

914
00:44:12,818 --> 00:44:14,185
(chuckles)

915
00:44:14,219 --> 00:44:15,020
So nasty.

916
00:44:15,053 --> 00:44:16,321
(laughs)

917
00:44:16,354 --> 00:44:17,823
No,

918
00:44:17,856 --> 00:44:19,000
but for real I'm thankful
I have somebody like you

919
00:44:19,024 --> 00:44:20,024
in my life.

920
00:44:21,026 --> 00:44:23,094
I loved you and I'm
forever grateful

921
00:44:23,128 --> 00:44:25,063
to have you as a friend.

922
00:44:25,964 --> 00:44:27,766
Well I love you too.

923
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:32,402
Friend.

924
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,653
(ball clunks)

925
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,364
I'm trying to tell
y'all been practicing,

926
00:44:50,388 --> 00:44:51,489
man you ain't believe me.

927
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:52,700
I'm getting too old for this.

928
00:44:52,724 --> 00:44:53,724
Whatever man.

929
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:57,028
You might as well go
and retire damn shoes.

930
00:44:57,062 --> 00:44:58,029
These are Michael's.

931
00:44:58,063 --> 00:45:00,231
Is officially broken.

932
00:45:00,265 --> 00:45:01,032
No, no.

933
00:45:01,066 --> 00:45:02,367
(indistinct)

934
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,234
You gotta look.

935
00:45:03,268 --> 00:45:04,702
You got my short.

936
00:45:04,736 --> 00:45:06,071
Man look knee shorts.

937
00:45:06,104 --> 00:45:07,405
Ain't got shit to do.

938
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:09,440
I was running you up
and down at court.

939
00:45:09,474 --> 00:45:10,876
I was in that (mumbles).

940
00:45:10,909 --> 00:45:12,410
Oh, oh bro.

941
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:14,813
Pause, pause, pause, pause.

942
00:45:14,846 --> 00:45:16,782
Now, it's good to see
you smile my dude.

943
00:45:18,149 --> 00:45:20,385
I mean, I know it's been
rough with you losing Simone,

944
00:45:20,418 --> 00:45:21,987
and all that.

945
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,388
Yeah.

946
00:45:23,421 --> 00:45:25,190
Crazy days making the bed.

947
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:26,024
(laughs)

948
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:26,992
Listen man.

949
00:45:27,025 --> 00:45:27,826
You know you like to date?

950
00:45:27,859 --> 00:45:28,827
No, please?

951
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,061
Nah, seriously don't man.

952
00:45:30,095 --> 00:45:31,272
I take the fall for
that one, all right.

953
00:45:31,296 --> 00:45:32,097
My bad.

954
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,130
It's all good.

955
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:36,134
I know y'all meant well.

956
00:45:36,167 --> 00:45:36,968
You are my boys.

957
00:45:37,002 --> 00:45:38,069
For sure.

958
00:45:38,103 --> 00:45:39,938
I know y'all
wouldn't do anything to

959
00:45:39,971 --> 00:45:40,972
intentionally hurt me.

960
00:45:46,144 --> 00:45:47,813
You are right.

961
00:45:47,846 --> 00:45:49,456
There is something I need
to talk to you about.

962
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,116
Hold on, did you see that?

963
00:45:51,149 --> 00:45:53,484
(rock music)

964
00:45:57,322 --> 00:45:58,556
- Damn.
- Damn.

965
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:01,691
Damn, wow!

966
00:46:06,197 --> 00:46:07,065
Did you see that?

967
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:08,599
Unfortunately.

968
00:46:08,633 --> 00:46:11,903
But her face looks like a
(indistinct) beetle juice.

969
00:46:11,937 --> 00:46:12,904
(sighs)

970
00:46:12,938 --> 00:46:14,572
Dreamboat ass,

971
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:15,740
shipwreck face.

972
00:46:16,741 --> 00:46:18,343
Bad combination.

973
00:46:18,376 --> 00:46:19,477
Lord have mercy.

974
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:20,946
(chuckles)

975
00:46:20,979 --> 00:46:25,116
So, what's the issue
you want to talk me about?

976
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:26,351
Well you don't have...

977
00:46:26,384 --> 00:46:27,384
Dominique.

978
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,832
This would be one
of your many women?

979
00:46:30,856 --> 00:46:31,856
Shut up man.

980
00:46:33,859 --> 00:46:34,826
Elena,

981
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:35,994
what's up?

982
00:46:36,027 --> 00:46:37,095
Hey you.

983
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:37,929
How are you doing?

984
00:46:37,963 --> 00:46:38,763
Doing good.

985
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:39,597
How are you?

986
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:40,531
I'm doing good.

987
00:46:40,565 --> 00:46:42,433
This is my homeboy Rain Wilkins.

988
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:45,303
Rain, this is one of my former
colleagues Elena McDaniels.

989
00:46:45,336 --> 00:46:46,737
Nice to meet you.

990
00:46:46,771 --> 00:46:48,106
The pleasure is all mine.

991
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:53,644
Yo, Elena is one of
the sharpest attorneys

992
00:46:53,678 --> 00:46:54,946
in the region, man.

993
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:56,157
She was one of the
first women to average.

994
00:46:56,181 --> 00:46:57,348
Okay, okay.

995
00:46:57,382 --> 00:47:00,118
I believe I can tell
him about myself

996
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:02,020
over dinner tomorrow night?

997
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:06,858
Are you?

998
00:47:06,892 --> 00:47:07,892
Um,

999
00:47:09,394 --> 00:47:14,365
are you asking me out to dinner?

1000
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,068
That depends.

1001
00:47:17,102 --> 00:47:18,469
Are you saying yes?

1002
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:20,770
Um,

1003
00:47:22,607 --> 00:47:24,075
yes.

1004
00:47:24,109 --> 00:47:25,010
Yes.

1005
00:47:25,043 --> 00:47:26,477
I'd be on to it.

1006
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:28,179
Excellent.

1007
00:47:28,213 --> 00:47:30,281
Get my number from Dominique.

1008
00:47:30,315 --> 00:47:31,249
Text me later.

1009
00:47:31,282 --> 00:47:33,551
And we'll discuss the dates.

1010
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:34,685
Okay.

1011
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:35,520
All right.

1012
00:47:35,553 --> 00:47:36,553
Until then.

1013
00:47:37,155 --> 00:47:38,123
Until then.

1014
00:47:38,156 --> 00:47:39,024
See you later.

1015
00:47:39,057 --> 00:47:40,057
Same.

1016
00:47:44,729 --> 00:47:45,729
My man.

1017
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,033
My man.

1018
00:47:48,066 --> 00:47:49,901
That's what I'm talking about.

1019
00:47:49,935 --> 00:47:50,936
Yeah.

1020
00:47:50,969 --> 00:47:54,139
(rock music continues)

1021
00:48:17,062 --> 00:48:18,029
(laughs)

1022
00:48:18,063 --> 00:48:19,697
Thanks for bringing that up.

1023
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,199
(chuckles)

1024
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:22,100
The girl was acting
like having a conversation

1025
00:48:22,133 --> 00:48:23,734
with the civil (indistinct).

1026
00:48:23,768 --> 00:48:25,279
Like she was acting
out of a conversations

1027
00:48:25,303 --> 00:48:26,771
like the damn spoon,
fork and knife,

1028
00:48:26,804 --> 00:48:29,107
when I talk back to her.

1029
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:29,941
What?

1030
00:48:29,975 --> 00:48:30,775
It was crazy.

1031
00:48:30,808 --> 00:48:31,609
Okay.

1032
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:32,843
That's nothing.

1033
00:48:32,877 --> 00:48:35,680
I went out on a date
once with this guy

1034
00:48:35,713 --> 00:48:40,385
and his entire
pregnant wife shows up.

1035
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:43,388
So, she obviously
took an Uber there

1036
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:45,991
just to bust his ass.

1037
00:48:46,024 --> 00:48:46,824
Oh no, no, no,

1038
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:47,993
but catch this,

1039
00:48:48,026 --> 00:48:50,028
her water breaks.

1040
00:48:50,061 --> 00:48:52,597
And apparently he doesn't
have a car either,

1041
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:54,332
which I didn't know.

1042
00:48:54,365 --> 00:48:56,567
So what did I do?

1043
00:48:56,601 --> 00:49:00,371
Drove both of them
to the hospital

1044
00:49:00,405 --> 00:49:02,740
so she could have their baby.

1045
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,942
(chuckles)

1046
00:49:06,377 --> 00:49:07,278
That's crazy.

1047
00:49:07,312 --> 00:49:08,779
Exactly.

1048
00:49:08,813 --> 00:49:12,317
One of the worst
dates of my life.

1049
00:49:14,652 --> 00:49:16,021
But I'm,

1050
00:49:16,054 --> 00:49:17,288
(chuckles)

1051
00:49:17,322 --> 00:49:19,324
I'm just really
glad that tonight

1052
00:49:19,357 --> 00:49:21,759
is panning out to be different.

1053
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:22,960
Yeah, me too.

1054
00:49:25,563 --> 00:49:27,698
If I ask you something,

1055
00:49:27,732 --> 00:49:30,768
will you promise to be
completely honest with me?

1056
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:33,604
Depends on what you ask.

1057
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:35,740
(chuckles)

1058
00:49:35,773 --> 00:49:37,075
No, not like that.

1059
00:49:37,108 --> 00:49:38,776
What do you want to know?

1060
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:39,877
Who broke your heart.

1061
00:49:43,614 --> 00:49:44,614
Why do you ask?

1062
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:46,984
I mean,

1063
00:49:47,018 --> 00:49:49,620
behind the smiles,

1064
00:49:49,654 --> 00:49:52,523
the laughs and the
great conversation.

1065
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,926
I still see sadness
in your eyes.

1066
00:50:00,198 --> 00:50:01,532
I mean if it's too (indistinct).

1067
00:50:01,566 --> 00:50:03,134
Oh, no, no it's fine.

1068
00:50:04,569 --> 00:50:08,273
I think I can finally talk
about breaking down and crying.

1069
00:50:08,306 --> 00:50:10,441
(chuckles)

1070
00:50:13,278 --> 00:50:14,279
Her name was Simone,

1071
00:50:16,147 --> 00:50:18,049
we were together for
about three years.

1072
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:22,220
On her birthday,

1073
00:50:22,253 --> 00:50:25,022
I proposed to her
and she said no.

1074
00:50:26,991 --> 00:50:29,026
(signs) No.

1075
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:30,195
Yeah,

1076
00:50:30,228 --> 00:50:32,029
it was in front of
friends and everything.

1077
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,364
I'm sorry.

1078
00:50:33,398 --> 00:50:34,398
Yeah.

1079
00:50:35,266 --> 00:50:36,934
I really loved her, you know.

1080
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:37,967
Like I felt like,

1081
00:50:39,104 --> 00:50:41,406
I could spend the rest
of my life with her.

1082
00:50:41,439 --> 00:50:43,941
But I guess she had other plans.

1083
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,844
Well, that's her loss.

1084
00:50:47,845 --> 00:50:48,845
Thank you.

1085
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,948
And her loss,

1086
00:50:56,187 --> 00:50:57,187
is my gain.

1087
00:50:58,022 --> 00:51:01,326
(upbeat music continues)

1088
00:51:07,965 --> 00:51:10,768
(computer clicks)

1089
00:51:11,936 --> 00:51:14,872
Yo, it was perfect.

1090
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:18,176
The way she looked at him
and the way he looked at her,

1091
00:51:18,209 --> 00:51:21,246
you could see instant fireworks.

1092
00:51:21,279 --> 00:51:22,280
I think it would work.

1093
00:51:23,448 --> 00:51:24,982
Definitely looked
out for my boy.

1094
00:51:26,117 --> 00:51:27,117
Good for him.

1095
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:33,158
Now,

1096
00:51:33,191 --> 00:51:35,360
when are you going to
come and take care of me?

1097
00:51:38,263 --> 00:51:40,231
Oh, (sighs)

1098
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:47,071
Not fair.

1099
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:49,640
We said last time
was the last time.

1100
00:51:49,674 --> 00:51:50,908
Yeah,

1101
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,353
we said that the last
time before that.

1102
00:51:52,377 --> 00:51:53,778
And then the time before that.

1103
00:51:53,811 --> 00:51:55,689
Oh, and then that week
before that we said that too.

1104
00:51:55,713 --> 00:51:59,950
I mean, how can I resist
you wearing shit like that?

1105
00:51:59,984 --> 00:52:02,353
That is a very easy question.

1106
00:52:08,893 --> 00:52:10,060
Because you,

1107
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:12,530
you don't want to?

1108
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,100
This is wrong.

1109
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:18,068
This is wrong Simone.

1110
00:52:18,102 --> 00:52:19,069
Oh my gosh.

1111
00:52:19,103 --> 00:52:20,605
Rain is one of
my best friends.

1112
00:52:21,772 --> 00:52:23,241
I mean..

1113
00:52:23,274 --> 00:52:26,444
And I am standing right
here in front of you

1114
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:29,013
waiting for you to take me.

1115
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:33,017
It's a dangerous game.

1116
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:34,485
We playing Simone.

1117
00:52:35,353 --> 00:52:37,488
Good thing I came to win.

1118
00:52:37,522 --> 00:52:39,890
(rock music)

1119
00:56:27,652 --> 00:56:30,320
(indistinct chattering)

1120
00:56:30,354 --> 00:56:31,656
That was beautiful.

1121
00:56:31,689 --> 00:56:33,123
(indistinct) one more tonight.

1122
00:56:33,157 --> 00:56:34,191
One more tonight.

1123
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,826
(chuckles)

1124
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:36,860
It's nice.

1125
00:56:38,863 --> 00:56:41,031
(sighs)

1126
00:56:47,472 --> 00:56:49,607
Is that Rain and his new boo?

1127
00:56:54,679 --> 00:56:55,580
Yep.

1128
00:56:55,613 --> 00:56:56,647
That's them.

1129
00:56:56,681 --> 00:56:57,682
Damn she cute.

1130
00:56:59,216 --> 00:57:00,117
I mean,

1131
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,051
not cuter than you.

1132
00:57:01,085 --> 00:57:02,052
(chuckles)

1133
00:57:02,086 --> 00:57:03,621
Don't start Caroline.

1134
00:57:03,654 --> 00:57:05,856
I'm just saying that
could have been you.

1135
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:06,824
Well,

1136
00:57:06,857 --> 00:57:08,158
it's not so just drop it.

1137
00:57:08,192 --> 00:57:09,226
I'm gonna say hey.

1138
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:10,060
Don't,

1139
00:57:10,094 --> 00:57:10,895
don't.

1140
00:57:10,928 --> 00:57:12,029
Rain?

1141
00:57:12,062 --> 00:57:13,564
Hey,

1142
00:57:13,598 --> 00:57:14,598
hey.

1143
00:57:20,938 --> 00:57:22,406
(chuckles)

1144
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:23,808
What's up AJ,

1145
00:57:23,841 --> 00:57:24,642
Caroline.

1146
00:57:24,675 --> 00:57:25,476
What's up Rain.

1147
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:26,577
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1148
00:57:26,611 --> 00:57:28,245
Let's skip all the pleasantries.

1149
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:30,247
Who do we have here?

1150
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,182
Oh, this is Elena,
my girlfriend.

1151
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,118
Hi.

1152
00:57:34,151 --> 00:57:35,486
Nice to meet you both.

1153
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,054
Likewise.

1154
00:57:37,087 --> 00:57:38,489
Girlfriend.

1155
00:57:38,523 --> 00:57:40,758
And how long have you
two known each other?

1156
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:43,227
Couple of weeks now,

1157
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:44,260
I suppose.

1158
00:57:45,429 --> 00:57:47,364
Isn't that a little
soon to be calling someone

1159
00:57:47,397 --> 00:57:48,566
your girlfriend.

1160
00:57:50,568 --> 00:57:54,572
What she means
is congratulations.

1161
00:57:54,605 --> 00:57:55,640
Glad you found someone.

1162
00:57:55,673 --> 00:57:56,774
You deserve to be happy.

1163
00:57:57,642 --> 00:57:58,776
Thanks Aj.

1164
00:57:58,809 --> 00:57:59,610
You welcome.

1165
00:57:59,644 --> 00:58:00,778
I appreciate that.

1166
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:02,112
Mm-hmm.

1167
00:58:02,146 --> 00:58:03,614
Come on Rain.

1168
00:58:03,648 --> 00:58:05,449
We should really get going.

1169
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:07,217
We don't want to
miss our tea time.

1170
00:58:07,251 --> 00:58:08,953
She's taking me to play golf.

1171
00:58:08,986 --> 00:58:10,664
I'm about to get my Tiger
Woods off. (chuckles)

1172
00:58:10,688 --> 00:58:11,656
Okay.

1173
00:58:11,689 --> 00:58:13,123
Yes.

1174
00:58:13,157 --> 00:58:16,160
All right, ladies it was
really nice to meet you all.

1175
00:58:16,193 --> 00:58:17,194
(chuckles) Wasn't it?

1176
00:58:17,227 --> 00:58:18,227
- Bye.
- See y'all later.

1177
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:21,065
They were really nice.

1178
00:58:21,098 --> 00:58:21,899
It's all good.

1179
00:58:21,932 --> 00:58:24,769
(soft piano music)

1180
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:27,572
Why did you do that?

1181
00:58:27,605 --> 00:58:29,073
What?

1182
00:58:29,106 --> 00:58:30,274
Gay people's gay man.

1183
00:58:30,307 --> 00:58:31,842
She looks like she's
playing for keeps.

1184
00:58:33,477 --> 00:58:34,845
And she'll do whatever it takes

1185
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:36,380
to make sure it stays that way.

1186
00:58:37,682 --> 00:58:39,817
Even if it means
breaking the rules.

1187
00:58:41,752 --> 00:58:45,522
(soft piano music continues)

1188
00:58:53,397 --> 00:58:54,699
Hey babe.

1189
00:58:54,732 --> 00:58:57,434
I was thinking we could
do tire for lunch.

1190
00:58:57,467 --> 00:58:58,467
How does that sound?

1191
00:58:59,604 --> 00:59:01,238
That's cool with me.

1192
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:03,307
Whatever you want.

1193
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:06,010
(phone vibrates)

1194
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:30,735
What the hell?

1195
00:59:32,169 --> 00:59:32,937
Babe, where are we gonna
eat this tire food at?

1196
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:33,970
I'm hungry.

1197
00:59:37,274 --> 00:59:39,944
Yo, what the hell are
you doing on my phone?

1198
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:43,013
How do you even
unlock it anyway.

1199
00:59:43,047 --> 00:59:44,581
You know boy,

1200
00:59:44,615 --> 00:59:47,317
boy I had your passcode
a long time ago.

1201
00:59:47,351 --> 00:59:48,653
Now I answered my question.

1202
00:59:49,754 --> 00:59:51,989
Why have you got his
nasty ass text messages

1203
00:59:52,022 --> 00:59:52,823
from this hoes?

1204
00:59:52,857 --> 00:59:53,857
Huh?

1205
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:57,294
They're not hoes.

1206
00:59:59,529 --> 01:00:01,198
They are my female
acquaintances.

1207
01:00:01,231 --> 01:00:02,532
Like I said,

1208
01:00:02,566 --> 01:00:04,201
hoes.

1209
01:00:04,234 --> 01:00:05,035
Simone,

1210
01:00:05,069 --> 01:00:05,870
hat's the issue?

1211
01:00:05,903 --> 01:00:07,371
Oh, hello.

1212
01:00:07,404 --> 01:00:11,275
I left Rain so that we
can be in a relationship.

1213
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:15,145
What the hell is that.

1214
01:00:16,313 --> 01:00:18,749
You said the R word.

1215
01:00:18,783 --> 01:00:19,850
Look, Dominique,

1216
01:00:19,884 --> 01:00:21,618
I'm not playing with you.

1217
01:00:21,652 --> 01:00:24,722
I left my three year long
relationship with Rain.

1218
01:00:24,755 --> 01:00:26,290
So that I can be with somebody

1219
01:00:26,323 --> 01:00:29,860
who I thought wanted to be
with me for the long haul.

1220
01:00:29,894 --> 01:00:33,497
I assume that you I are on the
road towards getting married.

1221
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:34,899
Ooh.

1222
01:00:34,932 --> 01:00:36,376
You know what they say
about those who are selling.

1223
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,302
And if you finish
that statement,

1224
01:00:38,335 --> 01:00:41,271
I'm gonna slap that
beard off of your face.

1225
01:00:43,273 --> 01:00:44,273
Listen Simone,

1226
01:00:46,443 --> 01:00:47,978
I never said we were exclusive.

1227
01:00:49,714 --> 01:00:51,081
I mean,

1228
01:00:51,115 --> 01:00:55,052
I care about you and I
do want to be with you,

1229
01:00:56,520 --> 01:01:00,490
but I'm not trying
to be a lockdown.

1230
01:01:00,524 --> 01:01:01,692
I mean,

1231
01:01:01,726 --> 01:01:04,394
besides I'm already
sticking my neck out,

1232
01:01:04,428 --> 01:01:05,863
risking my friendship
with my boy

1233
01:01:05,896 --> 01:01:08,032
to be with you in
the first place.

1234
01:01:08,065 --> 01:01:10,400
Did nobody make you
sneak around with my ass?

1235
01:01:10,434 --> 01:01:11,635
No.

1236
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:14,872
But you did continue
to throw it at me.

1237
01:01:14,905 --> 01:01:15,973
Begging me to take it.

1238
01:01:17,307 --> 01:01:21,812
You are nothing but
a low down dirty dog.

1239
01:01:25,983 --> 01:01:29,619
(suspenseful music)

1240
01:01:29,653 --> 01:01:30,955
(spanks butt)

1241
01:01:30,988 --> 01:01:32,489
Wolf, Wolf baby.

1242
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,893
Now we still going to
get that food or what?

1243
01:01:35,926 --> 01:01:38,228
(chuckles)

1244
01:01:38,262 --> 01:01:40,197
You know what?

1245
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:42,399
Why don't you call
up one of your

1246
01:01:42,432 --> 01:01:44,969
little female acquaintances?

1247
01:01:45,002 --> 01:01:47,571
'Cause I'm sure one of
them wants to give you

1248
01:01:47,604 --> 01:01:48,939
their rotten peach.

1249
01:01:51,776 --> 01:01:52,776
Pock ass.

1250
01:01:55,112 --> 01:01:56,013
Oh,

1251
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:56,914
Mm-hmm.

1252
01:01:56,947 --> 01:01:57,947
Yeah.

1253
01:01:58,548 --> 01:01:59,548
Before I forget,

1254
01:02:01,018 --> 01:02:04,321
just so that we're clear
and I mean crystal.

1255
01:02:04,354 --> 01:02:06,023
This right here.

1256
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:07,056
It's done.

1257
01:02:11,295 --> 01:02:13,097
So I guess I said
no all the time.

1258
01:02:14,064 --> 01:02:17,467
(suspenseful music begins)

1259
01:02:17,501 --> 01:02:20,437
(rock music begins)

1260
01:02:49,566 --> 01:02:53,137
♪ Don't switch up on me,

1261
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:57,774

(music continues)

1272
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:47,391
What would you wanna eat?

1273
01:03:47,424 --> 01:03:50,027
(indistinct)

1274
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:54,364
Rain,

1275
01:03:54,398 --> 01:03:55,365
what a surprise?

1276
01:03:55,399 --> 01:03:57,034
What are you doing here?

1277
01:03:57,067 --> 01:03:59,303
This is where my introduction
to rocket in class.

1278
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:01,238
What a coincidence?

1279
01:04:01,271 --> 01:04:02,907
Not really.

1280
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:04,274
I teach here every Thursday.

1281
01:04:04,308 --> 01:04:05,375
You know that.

1282
01:04:05,409 --> 01:04:06,576
Semantics.

1283
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:08,012
Listen, are you busy?

1284
01:04:08,045 --> 01:04:10,280
Because I would love to
talk to you about something.

1285
01:04:10,314 --> 01:04:11,115
Well, I..

1286
01:04:11,148 --> 01:04:12,316
He actually is.

1287
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:14,218
We have somewhere
that we need to be.

1288
01:04:14,251 --> 01:04:15,052
Okay, good.

1289
01:04:15,085 --> 01:04:16,320
So you're free.

1290
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:18,822
Listen, I am so sorry

1291
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:21,391
for anything soar
that I did between us.

1292
01:04:21,425 --> 01:04:25,495
I should not have rejected your
marriage proposal that way.

1293
01:04:25,529 --> 01:04:27,864
I was a fool to let
a man like you go.

1294
01:04:27,898 --> 01:04:29,733
You got the fool part, right?

1295
01:04:29,766 --> 01:04:30,968
Excuse you.

1296
01:04:31,001 --> 01:04:32,236
You heard what I said?

1297
01:04:32,269 --> 01:04:33,703
Look,

1298
01:04:33,737 --> 01:04:35,739
I have invested three years
into this relationship.

1299
01:04:35,772 --> 01:04:37,374
The boy is mine.

1300
01:04:37,407 --> 01:04:38,608
Well,

1301
01:04:38,642 --> 01:04:40,610
it's only taken me
a couple of weeks,

1302
01:04:40,644 --> 01:04:43,680
to undo the damage
that you have done.

1303
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:48,118
Turning this hurt boy
into a strong mate.

1304
01:04:48,152 --> 01:04:51,088
So it all belongs to me.

1305
01:04:52,656 --> 01:04:54,391
I bet if he
proposed to me again,

1306
01:04:56,293 --> 01:04:57,962
I would say yes
to you this time.

1307
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:01,031
Well,

1308
01:05:01,065 --> 01:05:04,868
you're not going to be
able to say anything.

1309
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:06,903
After I knock your teeth out.

1310
01:05:06,937 --> 01:05:08,538
Okay ladies, ladies.

1311
01:05:08,572 --> 01:05:11,208
Now as much as I love
a good girlfriend

1312
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:13,143
and I do indeed love
a good girlfriend.

1313
01:05:17,281 --> 01:05:19,216
You can't be acting
like this in public.

1314
01:05:20,384 --> 01:05:21,285
Fine.

1315
01:05:21,318 --> 01:05:22,486
You get a boxing ring.

1316
01:05:22,519 --> 01:05:23,453
I'll fight that (indistinct).

1317
01:05:23,487 --> 01:05:25,956
Okay Simone, stop. all right.

1318
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:27,391
Look,

1319
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:28,634
I don't know what's changed
for you to be acting like this,

1320
01:05:28,658 --> 01:05:30,027
but none of that shit matters.

1321
01:05:31,628 --> 01:05:34,564
You broke my heart into a
million pieces when you said no.

1322
01:05:36,133 --> 01:05:37,534
Now, it's taken some time,

1323
01:05:37,567 --> 01:05:39,970
but I finally got to
put back together.

1324
01:05:41,505 --> 01:05:43,807
And the stakes to this
beautiful woman by my side.

1325
01:05:45,242 --> 01:05:46,376
He's talking about me.

1326
01:05:48,645 --> 01:05:51,381
Simone, you made your choice,

1327
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:56,020
and Elena is mine.

1328
01:05:57,654 --> 01:05:58,522
But Rain.

1329
01:05:58,555 --> 01:05:59,689
Come on baby.

1330
01:06:05,062 --> 01:06:06,997
(phone vibrates)

1331
01:06:07,031 --> 01:06:07,998
You okay?

1332
01:06:08,032 --> 01:06:08,865
Yeah,

1333
01:06:08,898 --> 01:06:09,898
I'm gonna get the phone.

1334
01:06:13,237 --> 01:06:14,904
Hello?

1335
01:06:14,938 --> 01:06:16,106
Oh, hey Scott.

1336
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:20,310
Oh no, I'm not doing
anything tomorrow.

1337
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:23,780
Sure.

1338
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,133
Yeah, I can come
into the station.

1339
01:06:28,218 --> 01:06:29,153
Oh,

1340
01:06:29,186 --> 01:06:30,720
okay.

1341
01:06:33,357 --> 01:06:34,357
Sounds good.

1342
01:06:36,726 --> 01:06:38,028
Yeah.

1343
01:06:38,062 --> 01:06:39,622
I'll see you first
thing in the morning.

1344
01:06:41,065 --> 01:06:41,998
Who was that?

1345
01:06:42,032 --> 01:06:44,034
That was my GM.

1346
01:06:44,068 --> 01:06:46,236
He wants to talk to me
about lifting my suspension

1347
01:06:46,270 --> 01:06:47,871
and giving me my old job back.

1348
01:06:47,904 --> 01:06:49,406
That's good right?

1349
01:06:49,439 --> 01:06:50,374
Rain.

1350
01:06:50,407 --> 01:06:51,575
(chuckles)

1351
01:06:51,608 --> 01:06:53,810
I believe in you on
my good luck though.

1352
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:55,445
Trust me baby.

1353
01:06:55,479 --> 01:06:57,947
Luck has nothing to do with it.

1354
01:06:57,981 --> 01:06:58,782
(chuckles)

1355
01:06:58,815 --> 01:06:59,815
I'm happy for you.

1356
01:07:00,817 --> 01:07:04,254
(suspenseful music begins)

1357
01:07:35,385 --> 01:07:37,821
(rock music)

1358
01:08:04,148 --> 01:08:05,282
Hey (indistinct).

1359
01:08:05,315 --> 01:08:06,315
Oh, boy!

1360
01:08:07,651 --> 01:08:09,119
What?

1361
01:08:09,153 --> 01:08:10,287
(indistinct)

1362
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:11,855
What the hell!

1363
01:08:11,888 --> 01:08:13,523
How's you'll?

1364
01:08:13,557 --> 01:08:14,557
Key.

1365
01:08:15,225 --> 01:08:16,726
Duh.

1366
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:17,661
(door closes)

1367
01:08:17,694 --> 01:08:19,529
You know what?

1368
01:08:19,563 --> 01:08:22,332
Not even free to look through
my group (indistinct).

1369
01:08:22,366 --> 01:08:23,366
Oh,.

1370
01:08:24,234 --> 01:08:25,402
What's up with you.

1371
01:08:25,435 --> 01:08:26,870
It's probably dilute.

1372
01:08:26,903 --> 01:08:27,771
Put [Interviewer] Down.

1373
01:08:27,804 --> 01:08:29,273
You even finish that statement.

1374
01:08:30,907 --> 01:08:31,908
(chuckles)

1375
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:33,410
I just got back from station.

1376
01:08:33,443 --> 01:08:35,445
Big boy getting his show back.

1377
01:08:35,479 --> 01:08:36,480
Nice.

1378
01:08:36,513 --> 01:08:37,781
That was awesome.

1379
01:08:37,814 --> 01:08:38,915
Congratulations.

1380
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:39,983
Thank you.

1381
01:08:40,016 --> 01:08:41,185
I'm glad to hear that

1382
01:08:41,218 --> 01:08:42,495
because that dude that
they had replaced,

1383
01:08:42,519 --> 01:08:43,987
you took temporarily,

1384
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:46,290
he was starting to
make my ears bleed.

1385
01:08:46,323 --> 01:08:47,157
(chuckles)

1386
01:08:47,191 --> 01:08:48,392
right.

1387
01:08:48,425 --> 01:08:49,659
Now that Danny,

1388
01:08:49,693 --> 01:08:51,094
what we said the other night,

1389
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:55,365
we say we like old boy 'cause
he plays a bit of rotation

1390
01:08:55,399 --> 01:08:57,201
and we want him to
stay in (indistinct).

1391
01:09:00,103 --> 01:09:01,103
Really?

1392
01:09:02,306 --> 01:09:04,274
I mean, boom.

1393
01:09:04,308 --> 01:09:05,442
I'm glad he's gone.

1394
01:09:05,475 --> 01:09:07,277
He sucks.

1395
01:09:07,311 --> 01:09:08,311
Anyway.

1396
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:11,581
I'm just glad that you got
your life back together.

1397
01:09:11,615 --> 01:09:12,615
Me too.

1398
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:16,152
I truly believe that
having a lady in my life

1399
01:09:16,186 --> 01:09:19,289
that's when all the things
turned around for me.

1400
01:09:19,323 --> 01:09:21,825
She has really helped to
see the value in myself.

1401
01:09:23,527 --> 01:09:24,527
Being with Elena,

1402
01:09:25,462 --> 01:09:27,030
it's like a breath of fresh air.

1403
01:09:29,299 --> 01:09:32,101
Man, that woman is amazing.

1404
01:09:34,438 --> 01:09:36,740
I don't see myself spending
the rest of my life with her.

1405
01:09:36,773 --> 01:09:38,542
Oh, damn.

1406
01:09:38,575 --> 01:09:40,310
Just think about
the proposal again.

1407
01:09:40,344 --> 01:09:42,846
It's not about the
proposal to Elena.

1408
01:09:42,879 --> 01:09:43,780
Not yet.

1409
01:09:43,813 --> 01:09:44,813
Anyway.

1410
01:09:46,149 --> 01:09:47,584
Well, I'm happy for you.

1411
01:09:48,518 --> 01:09:50,387
I say we celebrate.

1412
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:52,456
How about a little
holiday kickback?

1413
01:09:52,489 --> 01:09:55,992
(chuckles) sounds good
to me and we and where?

1414
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:58,228
Let's do it here, tonight.

1415
01:09:58,262 --> 01:09:59,062
What?

1416
01:09:59,095 --> 01:09:59,896
Duh,

1417
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:00,929
let's make it happen

1418
01:10:15,845 --> 01:10:17,113
Yo, you good?

1419
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:20,083
Yeah.

1420
01:10:20,116 --> 01:10:21,116
I'm okay.

1421
01:10:24,754 --> 01:10:25,855
See you tonight, okay?

1422
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:29,558
Good.

1423
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,134
What's wrong with her?

1424
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:41,271
(upbeat music begins)

1425
01:10:48,678 --> 01:10:52,449
(indistinct chattering)

1426
01:10:52,482 --> 01:10:53,850
I like this sweater man,

1427
01:10:53,883 --> 01:10:54,784
where did you get it from?

1428
01:10:54,818 --> 01:10:56,653
(indistinct)

1429
01:10:56,686 --> 01:10:57,654
It's nice,

1430
01:10:57,687 --> 01:10:58,488
Yeah, it's nice.

1431
01:10:58,522 --> 01:11:00,189
I appreciate.

1432
01:11:00,223 --> 01:11:01,691
You guys look
really good together.

1433
01:11:01,725 --> 01:11:03,168
Yeah, I've heard a lot
of good things about you.

1434
01:11:03,192 --> 01:11:05,862
Yeah, she is (indistinct).

1435
01:11:05,895 --> 01:11:06,863
I don't think so.

1436
01:11:06,896 --> 01:11:08,698
Like, you know.

1437
01:11:08,732 --> 01:11:09,533
Girl.

1438
01:11:09,566 --> 01:11:10,867
I like him yawn.

1439
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:12,802
(chuckles)

1440
01:11:12,836 --> 01:11:14,070
You crazy.

1441
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:15,204
(indistinct).

1442
01:11:15,238 --> 01:11:16,039
Like what?

1443
01:11:16,072 --> 01:11:16,873
Yeah.

1444
01:11:16,906 --> 01:11:19,075
(chuckles)

1445
01:11:21,511 --> 01:11:23,847
Try it and draw back another.

1446
01:11:25,549 --> 01:11:26,549
I like your breath.

1447
01:11:28,652 --> 01:11:29,619
Mm-hmm.

1448
01:11:29,653 --> 01:11:31,054
Oh.

1449
01:11:32,556 --> 01:11:33,657
You are sick.

1450
01:11:42,231 --> 01:11:44,033
(bell rings)

1451
01:11:44,067 --> 01:11:45,569
Hey, I got it (indistinct)

1452
01:11:45,602 --> 01:11:46,736
Yeah,

1453
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:48,113
'cause this is
indeed your kickback.

1454
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:49,773
In due to believe.

1455
01:11:49,806 --> 01:11:51,908
Oh, right. Cheers to that.

1456
01:11:51,941 --> 01:11:53,076
(chuckles)

1457
01:11:53,109 --> 01:11:56,380
(indistinct chattering)

1458
01:12:01,485 --> 01:12:02,352
Simone?

1459
01:12:02,386 --> 01:12:05,188
(soft piano music)

1460
01:12:09,926 --> 01:12:11,928
The hell are you doing here?

1461
01:12:11,961 --> 01:12:14,431
I saw that the whole
gang was together.

1462
01:12:14,464 --> 01:12:15,899
Friends.

1463
01:12:15,932 --> 01:12:16,932
Aj.

1464
01:12:19,268 --> 01:12:20,804
Damn, I thought I blocked her.

1465
01:12:23,573 --> 01:12:24,674
Hello everyone.

1466
01:12:25,775 --> 01:12:26,843
Simone.

1467
01:12:27,944 --> 01:12:29,212
What do you want?

1468
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:31,948
Well,

1469
01:12:31,981 --> 01:12:35,118
I saw that everyone was
celebrating your new found good

1470
01:12:35,151 --> 01:12:37,020
fortune face (indistinct) IG.

1471
01:12:38,855 --> 01:12:39,989
Damn I could have someone,

1472
01:12:40,023 --> 01:12:41,558
I blocked her.

1473
01:12:41,591 --> 01:12:44,994
So I thought that I should
join in on the festivities.

1474
01:12:45,028 --> 01:12:46,028
Simone,

1475
01:12:46,596 --> 01:12:48,097
you need to leave.

1476
01:12:49,533 --> 01:12:52,436
Why is that my dear Dominique?

1477
01:12:52,469 --> 01:12:56,640
So that your precious
secret isn't exposed.

1478
01:12:56,673 --> 01:12:58,141
Look Simone,

1479
01:12:58,174 --> 01:13:00,243
I don't give a damn about
any of your secrets,

1480
01:13:00,276 --> 01:13:02,612
whatever game it is that
you're trying to play.

1481
01:13:02,646 --> 01:13:04,414
You just need to leave.

1482
01:13:04,448 --> 01:13:08,284
I ain't going nowhere until
I say what I got to say.

1483
01:13:08,317 --> 01:13:09,495
Why can't you
just accept the fact

1484
01:13:09,519 --> 01:13:11,621
that you made the
decision to leave me?

1485
01:13:11,655 --> 01:13:12,622
And because of that,

1486
01:13:12,656 --> 01:13:15,358
you no longer have a place here.

1487
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:18,862
I'm with Elena now
and we're happy.

1488
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:20,363
(chuckles) Right?

1489
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:21,364
Okay.

1490
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:24,901
If your girl was so happy,

1491
01:13:24,934 --> 01:13:28,638
then why is Dominique
paying her to be with you?

1492
01:13:29,806 --> 01:13:30,806
What?

1493
01:13:34,644 --> 01:13:36,145
You lying.

1494
01:13:36,179 --> 01:13:37,179
Nope.

1495
01:13:40,817 --> 01:13:44,353
Elena is this true?

1496
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:50,860
I mean it started
out that way at first.

1497
01:13:50,894 --> 01:13:54,097
But once I started
to get to know you,

1498
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:56,065
I accepted less payments.

1499
01:13:59,469 --> 01:14:00,737
I mean,

1500
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:02,405
I was getting to the point where

1501
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:04,340
I could be with you for free.

1502
01:14:07,376 --> 01:14:10,313
(chuckles) Gosh.

1503
01:14:14,317 --> 01:14:15,317
Damn.

1504
01:14:16,352 --> 01:14:17,352
The tea is hot.

1505
01:14:18,855 --> 01:14:20,456
This is crazy.

1506
01:14:20,490 --> 01:14:21,825
Yes it is.

1507
01:14:21,858 --> 01:14:23,326
Oh,

1508
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:25,862
and how do I know that bit
of information you ask?

1509
01:14:25,895 --> 01:14:27,330
No one asked.

1510
01:14:27,363 --> 01:14:33,036
I know because I was with
Dominique when he made the call

1511
01:14:33,069 --> 01:14:36,005
after we had sex.

1512
01:14:36,973 --> 01:14:40,143
What?

1513
01:14:40,176 --> 01:14:40,977
Wait.

1514
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:42,445
That's right.

1515
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:46,983
Your bestie and I have
been having sex for months.

1516
01:14:48,151 --> 01:14:51,220
He's the reason that
I said no to you.

1517
01:14:54,524 --> 01:14:55,524
Damn!

1518
01:14:57,627 --> 01:14:59,195
Rain, Rain.

1519
01:14:59,228 --> 01:15:00,873
(indistinct) I don't want
to hear anything (indistinct)

1520
01:15:00,897 --> 01:15:01,698
right now.

1521
01:15:01,731 --> 01:15:03,399
Just let me explain.

1522
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:06,903
(door closes)

1523
01:15:08,738 --> 01:15:12,075
(sighs) Simone.

1524
01:15:12,108 --> 01:15:14,611
Nothing (indistinct).

1525
01:15:14,644 --> 01:15:15,612
Like I said,

1526
01:15:15,645 --> 01:15:18,014
I ain't going nowhere until I...

1527
01:15:18,047 --> 01:15:19,282
Bitch.

1528
01:15:19,315 --> 01:15:20,315
If you want.

1529
01:15:20,984 --> 01:15:21,818
Relax.

1530
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:22,652
Yeah.

1531
01:15:22,686 --> 01:15:23,686
Relax.

1532
01:15:24,988 --> 01:15:27,791
I ain't finished playing
with his hair yet.

1533
01:15:27,824 --> 01:15:28,824
Bye you'll.

1534
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:32,796
(indistinct chattering)

1535
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:55,418
So am I still
getting paid or not?

1536
01:15:56,686 --> 01:15:58,387
You ruining the game.

1537
01:16:02,225 --> 01:16:05,194
(soft piano music)

1538
01:16:06,129 --> 01:16:08,564
(door opens)

1539
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:13,102
(door closes)

1540
01:16:17,641 --> 01:16:19,609
Yo Rain, let me
holler at you for a sec.

1541
01:16:19,643 --> 01:16:21,978
The only thing I
want to know is why.

1542
01:16:22,011 --> 01:16:23,512
Why would you do that to me Dom?

1543
01:16:24,714 --> 01:16:25,714
It just.

1544
01:16:27,150 --> 01:16:28,652
Look, man.

1545
01:16:28,685 --> 01:16:29,962
Simone is one of those
things that just happened.

1546
01:16:29,986 --> 01:16:31,487
Bullshit.

1547
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,857
Dom you got your slew of women?

1548
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:35,067
You've got your pick
up all these women

1549
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:37,593
you be calling and
texting all the time.

1550
01:16:37,627 --> 01:16:39,195
Why did you have to
go sleep with mine.

1551
01:16:39,228 --> 01:16:41,530
Look man, I know I messed
up but I'm trying to make...

1552
01:16:41,564 --> 01:16:42,498
Or you think...

1553
01:16:42,531 --> 01:16:43,691
I got caught up, all right?

1554
01:16:45,268 --> 01:16:47,270
It was only supposed
to happen one time.

1555
01:16:50,907 --> 01:16:52,776
And then it happened
a second time

1556
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:56,612
and it did happen
multiple times.

1557
01:16:56,646 --> 01:17:00,650
I mean, negative shit
was just so good.

1558
01:17:01,885 --> 01:17:03,152
Well, you noticed that.

1559
01:17:03,186 --> 01:17:06,189
I'm trying to get
your ass kicked.

1560
01:17:06,222 --> 01:17:07,222
Listen, man.

1561
01:17:08,692 --> 01:17:11,194
There's nothing I can do or say,

1562
01:17:11,227 --> 01:17:12,628
explain to you what I did.

1563
01:17:14,297 --> 01:17:18,301
I stabbed you in your back
and I'm sorry about that.

1564
01:17:18,334 --> 01:17:19,334
You damn ritual.

1565
01:17:20,737 --> 01:17:22,271
And the whole thing with Elena.

1566
01:17:24,107 --> 01:17:26,218
Look, man, I feel guilty
about what I was doing, man.

1567
01:17:26,242 --> 01:17:29,112
And it didn't seeing everything
that you was going through.

1568
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:30,179
I had to do something.

1569
01:17:31,948 --> 01:17:33,449
So yeah,

1570
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:36,485
I paid one of my colleagues
to go out with you.

1571
01:17:36,519 --> 01:17:39,122
I mean, Elisa bought
you out of your phone

1572
01:17:39,155 --> 01:17:40,556
when things looking out for you.

1573
01:17:40,589 --> 01:17:41,633
Except for the fact
that my whole relationship

1574
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:43,827
with Elena was a lie.

1575
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:46,362
And my best friend slept with
the woman that I was planning

1576
01:17:46,395 --> 01:17:47,330
on spending the rest
of my life with.

1577
01:17:47,363 --> 01:17:49,733
Right, that's all over with.

1578
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,002
I mean the truth is out Rain.

1579
01:17:55,338 --> 01:17:58,241
I'm not kicking it
with Simone anymore.

1580
01:17:58,274 --> 01:17:59,408
I broke things off.

1581
01:18:00,609 --> 01:18:01,677
I chose you,

1582
01:18:02,545 --> 01:18:05,181
our friendship over her.

1583
01:18:06,816 --> 01:18:08,460
And so now things are
just supposed to go back to

1584
01:18:08,484 --> 01:18:10,019
how they were before, huh?

1585
01:18:10,053 --> 01:18:11,053
Exactly.

1586
01:18:11,888 --> 01:18:14,057
I mean, come on man.

1587
01:18:14,090 --> 01:18:15,091

1588
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:19,062

Yeah, you right.

01:18:28,071 --> 01:18:29,105

01:21:45,468 --> 01:21:47,703
Lock up when you leave.

1668
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:48,736
Good night.

1669
01:21:49,338 --> 01:21:54,243
I love you.

1670
01:21:54,277 --> 01:21:56,445
I love you too.

1671
01:21:56,479 --> 01:21:57,622
I love you more than a friend.

1672
01:21:57,646 --> 01:21:58,447
Not like a brother.

1673
01:21:58,481 --> 01:22:00,316
I want to be your lover.

1674
01:22:01,684 --> 01:22:03,252
What did you say?

1675
01:22:04,687 --> 01:22:08,224
I said I never had
nobody to show all these.

1676
01:22:09,658 --> 01:22:12,361
Should he show me in
this special way of yeah.

1677
01:22:12,395 --> 01:22:13,395
No, no.

1678
01:22:14,063 --> 01:22:16,132
That's not what you said?

1679
01:22:17,533 --> 01:22:21,304
You said, I love you
more than a friend.

1680
01:22:21,337 --> 01:22:22,938
Yes.

1681
01:22:22,972 --> 01:22:23,906
Yes Rain.

1682
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:25,341
I love you more than a friend.

1683
01:22:27,376 --> 01:22:28,411
(soft piano music begins)

1684
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:30,346
I loved you ever since,

1685
01:22:30,379 --> 01:22:32,948
the first day I saw
you in second grade,

1686
01:22:32,982 --> 01:22:35,484
I had just moved here and
you were my first friend.

1687
01:22:36,885 --> 01:22:38,654
And over the years,

1688
01:22:38,687 --> 01:22:40,523
my feelings for you grew,

1689
01:22:40,556 --> 01:22:41,657
but did our friendship.

1690
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:43,192
And I didn't want to lose that.

1691
01:22:44,427 --> 01:22:47,430
And besides I was
afraid to say anything.

1692
01:22:47,463 --> 01:22:50,299
'Cause I didn't think
you saw me like that.

1693
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:58,840
I saw you.

1694
01:23:01,477 --> 01:23:03,146
I've always seen you.

1695
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,449
And I see you now.

1696
01:23:08,884 --> 01:23:10,153
Yeah.

1697
01:23:10,186 --> 01:23:12,155
I've always had
feelings for you too.

1698
01:23:12,188 --> 01:23:14,823
But like you had in mind,

1699
01:23:14,857 --> 01:23:16,137
I didn't want to lose my friend.

1700
01:23:17,093 --> 01:23:18,294
My best friend,

1701
01:23:19,628 --> 01:23:21,897
the one who's always
been there for me.

1702
01:23:24,233 --> 01:23:26,769
The one who encourages
me and builds me up.

1703
01:23:29,572 --> 01:23:31,774
The one who loves
me no matter what.

1704
01:23:35,144 --> 01:23:37,313
And just to set the
record straight,

1705
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:43,919
I love you more than a
friend and not like a sister.

1706
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:49,992
I think this is about damn
time and I became your mystery.

1707
01:23:51,294 --> 01:23:54,330
(chuckles)

1708
01:23:54,363 --> 01:23:55,798
(indistinct) without you.

1709
01:23:56,732 --> 01:23:58,634
No, it was (indistinct)

1710
01:23:58,667 --> 01:23:59,935
We will work on that.

1711
01:23:59,968 --> 01:24:02,571
(chuckles)

1712
01:24:02,605 --> 01:24:03,605
Hey.

1713
01:24:04,273 --> 01:24:05,641
Yeah.

1714
01:24:05,674 --> 01:24:06,674
Look up.

1715
01:24:10,379 --> 01:24:12,315
(indistinct)

1716
01:24:12,348 --> 01:24:13,949
You know what that means?

1717
01:24:13,982 --> 01:24:16,085
(chuckles)

1718
01:24:22,925 --> 01:24:23,925
Okay,

1719
01:24:24,927 --> 01:24:25,927
Rain.

1720
01:24:26,862 --> 01:24:28,397
I've always wanted to do this.

1721
01:24:29,565 --> 01:24:32,067
So let me show you
how it is done.

1722
01:24:32,101 --> 01:24:32,901
(chuckles)

1723
01:24:32,935 --> 01:24:33,736
Okay.

1724
01:24:33,769 --> 01:24:34,870
Direct me baby.

1725
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:38,274
(piano music intensifies)

1726
01:24:54,190 --> 01:24:55,991
And that's the story
of how your mother

1727
01:24:56,024 --> 01:24:58,060
and I finally got together.

1728
01:24:58,093 --> 01:24:59,328
Come on dad.

1729
01:24:59,362 --> 01:25:00,539
I really didn't need
to hear all that.

1730
01:25:00,563 --> 01:25:01,330
Oh yeah.

1731
01:25:01,364 --> 01:25:02,565
(chuckles)

1732
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:05,000
How do you think you got in.

1733
01:25:05,033 --> 01:25:06,169
Teamor dad, teamor.

1734
01:25:09,405 --> 01:25:11,740
But what ever happened to
your friend, Dominique,

1735
01:25:11,774 --> 01:25:12,941
did you ever forgive him?

1736
01:25:14,443 --> 01:25:15,443
I did.

1737
01:25:16,145 --> 01:25:17,480

I just assumed.
