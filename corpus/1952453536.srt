Wombat, this is Eagle Nest.
We have lost your position.

3
00:01:07,395 --> 00:01:12,686
Repetition, we have lost your position.
Understood, Wombat?

4
00:01:14,896 --> 00:01:18,044
Wombat ... where is the object?

5
00:01:18,513 --> 00:01:22,196
Answer, Wombat.

6
00:01:47,317 --> 00:01:49,259
Just in time.

7
00:01:49,293 --> 00:01:53,010
Zeke, almost agree.

8
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,363
I'm almost there.

9
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:06,439
Goodnight.

10
00:02:34,974 --> 00:02:37,486
Open.

11
00:02:47,737 --> 00:02:50,249
I got it.

12
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,865
Do not, please.

13
00:02:54,326 --> 00:02:58,063
Do not.
It's too dangerous.

14
00:02:58,581 --> 00:03:00,971
I beg you.

15
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:04,783
Sorry, I do not speak Russian.

16
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:07,448

Rio Bamba, ECUADOR

23
00:04:45,056 --> 00:04:48,472
I still do not understand
why we are here.

24
00:04:48,572 --> 00:04:51,887
Because, Lieutenant, we need the best.

25
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:56,879
And this guy is so good?
- Yes.

26
00:04:56,979 --> 00:05:00,461
Why is he inactive?
- Because ...

27
00:05:02,203 --> 00:05:05,518
He has ten years dead.

28
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:27,977
Hello, Colonel.
- Hello, MacGruber.

29
00:05:28,012 --> 00:05:30,600
MacGruber?

30
00:05:30,703 --> 00:05:35,257
How did you find me?
- I've taught you everything.

31
00:05:38,341 --> 00:05:41,254
Not everything, Colonel.

32
00:05:42,594 --> 00:05:45,004
Hi, Jim.

33
00:05:45,138 --> 00:05:46,829
This is Lt. Piper Dixon.

34
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:50,267
Lieutenant, this is ...
- The legendary MacGruber.

35
00:05:50,367 --> 00:05:53,615
Former Navy Seal.
Army ranger and commando soldier.

Three Congressional Medals of Honor
seven Presidential Medal of Bravery ...

00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,916
and finally for
University of Texas El Paso.

41
00:06:10,966 --> 00:06:13,910
That was long ago.
- Listen, Mac ...

42
00:06:13,943 --> 00:06:17,123
Colonel, with all respect ...

43
00:06:17,158 --> 00:06:20,740
whatever you're here.
The answer is no.

44
00:06:21,713 --> 00:06:26,669
My life is here.
All I care about is in these walls.

45
00:06:26,769 --> 00:06:29,783
I am a peaceful man.
This is my home.

46
00:06:29,884 --> 00:06:32,027
This is my people.

47
00:06:32,831 --> 00:06:36,011
He gives it back.
- Fuck, MacGruber.

48
00:06:36,046 --> 00:06:39,147
Two days ago transported
a Russian nuclear missile escort an X5 ...

49
00:06:39,247 --> 00:06:40,698
and were robbed.

50
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:44,229
Yesterday informed a reliable
We source the goods in the U.S. are.

51
00:06:44,264 --> 00:06:45,827
That's not my problem anymore.

52
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:50,385
The X5 is one of the most powerful ...
- I know.

53
00:06:50,447 --> 00:06:53,194
Give us a moment.

54
00:07:00,563 --> 00:07:04,078
You're our only hope.
Your country needs you.

55
00:07:04,112 --> 00:07:08,197
I have more than enough
done for my country.

56
00:07:08,834 --> 00:07:11,423
If this goes to Casey ...
- It's not the point.

57
00:07:11,523 --> 00:07:14,380
But a promise to myself.
- Listen to me.

58
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,579
No, you listen to me.
I'm from the action ...

59
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:18,942
This action has changed.
- But not the players.

60
00:07:18,945 --> 00:07:22,596
It Cunth.

61
00:07:22,633 --> 00:07:24,100
What?

62
00:07:24,141 --> 00:07:30,370
We believe that the X5 now
in possession of Dieter Von Cunth.

63
00:07:35,494 --> 00:07:41,121
Mac, this is your opportunity to ask him
finally bring down.

64
00:07:43,364 --> 00:07:45,214
Sorry, Jim.

65
00:07:45,314 --> 00:07:47,549
I can not.

66
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:54,216
If you change your mind.

67
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:21,743
Do you, Casey Janine Fitzpatrick,
MacGruber as your faithful husband?

68
00:08:21,778 --> 00:08:25,294
Yes.

69
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:35,411
And do you, MacGruber, Janine Casey
Fitzpatrick as your faithful wife?

70
00:08:40,668 --> 00:08:43,882
Yes.

71
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:50,345
MacGruber?

72
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,690
WASHINGTON DC

73
00:10:03,685 --> 00:10:06,599
I participate.
- What?

74
00:10:07,837 --> 00:10:10,181
I participate.

75
00:10:10,249 --> 00:10:13,664
Thank God.
- Your God can not help you.

76
00:10:13,698 --> 00:10:16,444
But I do.

77
00:10:16,479 --> 00:10:19,593
What we know now?
- Unfortunately, little.

78
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:22,243
We believe that the goods Cunth
the U.S. has shipped ...

79
00:10:22,244 --> 00:10:26,736
but we lost the trail.
- I talked to the Colonel.

80
00:10:26,836 --> 00:10:29,738
Colonel?
- Everything he said is correct.

81
00:10:29,776 --> 00:10:32,154
Thanks, Colonel.

82
00:10:32,187 --> 00:10:35,536
Excuse me,
Cunth time to kick.

83
00:10:36,908 --> 00:10:40,694
Not so simple.
- To us he is a gun dealer ...

84
00:10:40,794 --> 00:10:45,036
but for others, a respected
businessman and police Ekman.

85
00:10:45,214 --> 00:10:47,488
Untouchable.
- I get it on, rookie.

86
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,794
I hit him where I want.

87
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:57,416
Our advantage is that even Cunth
passwords needed for the X5.

88
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,497
It is necessary that she
passwords do not get.

89
00:11:00,598 --> 00:11:04,583
Thanks for that, I had only not yet.

90
00:11:06,393 --> 00:11:10,776
I'm not going to lie to you.
This is a very unreasonable demand.

91
00:11:10,812 --> 00:11:16,216
It is said that a team of Cunth
most brutal criminals has made.

92
00:11:16,406 --> 00:11:19,554
Moss Bender. Zeke Pleshette.

93
00:11:19,588 --> 00:11:25,089
Constantine Bach and Culebra twins.
A dream team.

94
00:11:25,189 --> 00:11:29,341
Then I have my own dream team
preparation of killer stoppers.

95
00:11:29,369 --> 00:11:35,297
Beyond that. Lieutenant Piper
is the best and get help.

96
00:11:35,396 --> 00:11:40,051
I got a better idea:
No chance.

97
00:11:44,406 --> 00:11:47,219
I know I not fill expectations.
- Let me guess ...

98
00:11:47,553 --> 00:11:51,103
one year graduate,
no experience.

99
00:11:51,204 --> 00:11:53,481
Small who thinks his shit does not stink.

100
00:11:53,515 --> 00:11:57,189
So you know ...
your shit stinks though.

101
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,324
It smells like shit.

102
00:11:59,411 --> 00:12:02,426
Just give me a chance.
- Is this it?

103
00:12:03,127 --> 00:12:05,151
My nose.

104
00:12:05,236 --> 00:12:09,146
Excuse me, time to
real team together.

105
00:12:09,456 --> 00:12:12,403
Asshole.

106
00:13:05,656 --> 00:13:07,922
I manage, Rico.

107
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:12,966
So we know Frank.
Always wants to do everything by myself.

108
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:16,773
MacGruber, I thought you were dead.

109
00:13:17,983 --> 00:13:22,524
Last time I saw you, you had a hand in
'S Grenade Launcher and the other an M-16.

110
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,683
And you ripped someone's throat
with your bare hands.

111
00:13:25,718 --> 00:13:27,828
Classic MacGruber.

112
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:32,214
You keep your body strong.
- You do it yourself is not bad.

113
00:13:32,348 --> 00:13:36,721
Every day is training you as a python
nine kilograms in your pants.

114
00:13:36,821 --> 00:13:38,753
You and your dick comment.
- Nice to say.

115
00:13:38,853 --> 00:13:40,450
Nice to hear.
- Therefore I say them.

116
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,340
Therefore, I listen.

117
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:45,713
We had good times.
- Great times.

118
00:13:45,746 --> 00:13:47,956
We get more.

119
00:13:48,525 --> 00:13:51,639
I recognize that look.
- I need you, Frank.

120
00:13:51,673 --> 00:13:55,255
It's serious.
I propose a team.

121
00:13:56,597 --> 00:13:58,539
Then I do it.

122
00:15:51,098 --> 00:15:53,260
That was beautiful, Vicki.

123
00:15:53,275 --> 00:15:57,847
MacGruber. Were not you dead?
- I thought too.

124
00:15:57,882 --> 00:16:01,276
But I'm still alive.
And I suggest 's team.

125
00:16:01,623 --> 00:16:04,984
Good for you.
- No good for us.

126
00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:08,520
And good for America and
for fans of justice and truth ...

127
00:16:08,654 --> 00:16:10,563
because you're in that team.

128
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:15,151
I can not.
- Give me one good reason.

129
00:16:16,925 --> 00:16:19,638
Yes.
- And do you, MacGruber ...

130
00:16:19,705 --> 00:16:25,062
Casey Janine Fitzpatrick and wife?
- No!

131
00:16:29,921 --> 00:16:33,270
I lost my best friend then.
- Me too.

132
00:16:33,739 --> 00:16:37,790
And now we have chance for revenge.
- Revenge?

133
00:16:38,091 --> 00:16:40,402
It Cunth.

134
00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:46,363
Sorry, I'm starting a new life.
Music is my life now.

135
00:16:50,991 --> 00:16:53,201
If you change your mind.

136
00:16:57,588 --> 00:17:00,730
Good to see you again, Vicki.

137
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,852
I AM IN THE PENTAGON

138
00:17:09,972 --> 00:17:13,240
CUNTH'S AREA
LOCATION UNKNOWN

139
00:17:13,275 --> 00:17:14,631
Everything goes according to plan?

140
00:17:14,732 --> 00:17:18,651
Yes, Tuesday we must
have passwords.

141
00:17:19,588 --> 00:17:21,932
Beautiful.

142
00:17:21,965 --> 00:17:26,352
Ever been in DC?
- No.

143
00:17:26,452 --> 00:17:29,834
I talked to the rocket.

144
00:17:32,953 --> 00:17:37,172
Are you ready?
- Yes! Shoot Ready.

145
00:17:37,273 --> 00:17:39,383
Just like old times.

146
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:42,697
I need to close a deal
with the brass.

147
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:46,281
Please wait.

148
00:17:54,442 --> 00:17:56,905
Wait.

149
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,813
Yes, Mr. President, we have
MacGruber on the mission.

150
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,462
How's your nose, rookie?

151
00:18:06,562 --> 00:18:11,324
I hit it against "a big vagina.
- My face is a vagina?

152
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:16,596
Use your nose like a dick
and vaginal sex with my face.

153
00:18:16,631 --> 00:18:21,802
Last time I forgot to
I say how ugly you think.

154
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:24,143
Indeed.
- Well, very ugly.

155
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:26,189
You look in a mirror.
- Potty fight?

156
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,265
Wherever and whenever you want.

157
00:18:28,867 --> 00:18:32,704
I may start him.
Just kidding. I still hate you.

158
00:18:32,804 --> 00:18:34,728
And I you.
- Do you really fight?

159
00:18:34,828 --> 00:18:37,133
Guys!

160
00:18:37,173 --> 00:18:38,995
Calm.

161
00:18:39,445 --> 00:18:44,239
You have a reasonable team together?

162
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:47,030
A reasonable team?
That you can say.

163
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:52,701
Frank Korver, Tanker Lutz, Tut Beemer,
Tug Phelps, Vernon Freedom, I.

164
00:18:52,736 --> 00:18:55,183
It's best show reasonable team.

165
00:18:56,993 --> 00:19:01,801
Are you sure you meewilt Piper?

166
00:19:01,836 --> 00:19:04,249
I would like to ...

167
00:19:04,283 --> 00:19:06,493
but the van is packed.

168
00:19:06,526 --> 00:19:11,394
Filled with American heroes,
with 100 years experience ...

169
00:19:11,494 --> 00:19:16,297
and much camaraderie.
And no, the case does not.

170
00:19:16,371 --> 00:19:21,199
Because that is full of homemade C4 explosives.

171
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:26,653
I packed it with my own two ...

172
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,882
Damn.

173
00:19:32,251 --> 00:19:34,729
No, no.

174
00:19:35,971 --> 00:19:40,174
Tut, Tug are you okay?

175
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,172
There must be someone in it.

176
00:19:44,707 --> 00:19:48,458
Call 112.

177
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,202
The funerals were beautiful.
- Yes.

178
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:08,819
What did you think of my praise?

179
00:20:10,227 --> 00:20:15,451
Touching. I had less
V-words.

180
00:20:15,484 --> 00:20:17,159
They were damn good guys.

181
00:20:17,192 --> 00:20:20,675
And this is a damn fucking day.

182
00:20:21,326 --> 00:20:24,735
There were children.
- She laughed.

183
00:20:24,835 --> 00:20:29,564
By your lingo.
- Fuck with them.

184
00:20:31,032 --> 00:20:34,281
I had to sit in the van.
- But that was not.

185
00:20:34,347 --> 00:20:39,486
No, and nobody is there more
Cunth than sorry.

186
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,342
MacGruber, about ...

187
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:44,664
I will remove you from the case.

188
00:20:44,762 --> 00:20:47,841
I heard you down bad.
Because I heard:

189
00:20:47,941 --> 00:20:50,656
MacGruber, on this,
I will remove you from the case.

190
00:20:50,756 --> 00:20:54,201
I said exactly.
- You can not do.

191
00:20:54,274 --> 00:20:57,557
You said yourself that your best chance I had.

192
00:20:57,657 --> 00:21:00,549
But the action has changed.
- But not the players.

193
00:21:00,649 --> 00:21:06,773
I have no choice.
Because of this trauma you're too close.

194
00:21:06,834 --> 00:21:11,322
Without a team behind you,
I can not risk it.

195
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:13,867
Sorry.

196
00:21:26,782 --> 00:21:29,023
Sir, I ...

197
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,416
Where is the Colonel?
- I need your help.

198
00:21:31,451 --> 00:21:34,899
They want me to continue the mission.
- Given the circumstances ...

199
00:21:34,935 --> 00:21:38,779
Fuck, fart.
I meant it not.

200
00:21:38,818 --> 00:21:40,859
What do you want?

201
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:42,844
You in my team.
- What?

202
00:21:42,879 --> 00:21:46,240
Join my new team
and tell the Colonel that I can.

203
00:21:46,318 --> 00:21:48,422
I can not.
- Good.

204
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:52,815
Do not make me beg.
Because I do.

205
00:21:53,787 --> 00:21:56,731
I'm so sorry.

206
00:21:59,984 --> 00:22:05,239
I'm crazy.
I have them all killed.

207
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:08,179
I'm an idiot.

208
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:13,309
I do not even know what I do
and everyone hates me.

209
00:22:17,256 --> 00:22:19,185
I pipe you.

210
00:22:19,276 --> 00:22:22,959
I like fucking you tube
you come to my team.

211
00:22:22,994 --> 00:22:28,987
I pipe you, or you can fuck me
if I fuck you. Whether you see me fuck something.

212
00:22:29,021 --> 00:22:31,901
Point to something and I fuck it.

213
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:35,820
Tell me what I need to fuck.
- Jesus Christ.

214
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:40,199
Tell me what I need to fuck.

215
00:22:41,316 --> 00:22:44,731
I have no lubricant.
Do you see something white-out?

216
00:22:44,767 --> 00:22:48,147
Print or copy to work.
- Put your pants back on.

217
00:22:48,248 --> 00:22:51,395
I do not know what I do.

218
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:56,418
I'm so fucked up.

219
00:22:56,688 --> 00:22:59,032
Come on, MacGruber ...

220
00:22:59,736 --> 00:23:02,482
it's not so bad.
- Of course not.

221
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:06,735
The man who killed my wife
has a nuclear missile ...

222
00:23:06,835 --> 00:23:11,456
and I can change nothing.
And it's not so bad?

223
00:23:12,862 --> 00:23:15,240
Did Cunth your wife killed?

224
00:23:16,244 --> 00:23:22,424
It was never proven.
But I saw it happen.

225
00:23:22,425 --> 00:23:24,970
Sorry, I did not.

226
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:30,294
This mission was my chance to do
I had to do ten years ago.

227
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:37,270
I blew it.
- Awaits a helicopter toward Ecuador.

228
00:23:41,381 --> 00:23:45,500
Colonel, sorry I disappointed you.

229
00:23:47,944 --> 00:23:50,355
Piper.

230
00:23:51,326 --> 00:23:54,239
I participate.
- Lieutenant?

231
00:23:54,339 --> 00:23:56,549
I participate in the team.

232
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:59,380
Really?
- Sorry, Lieutenant ...

233
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,273
two people are not a team.
- But three do.

234
00:24:03,373 --> 00:24:05,555
Vicki?

235
00:24:05,655 --> 00:24:08,047
I heard what happened.
Maybe you could help.

236
00:24:08,147 --> 00:24:12,590
What about your music?
- That can wait.

237
00:24:12,793 --> 00:24:17,601
Piper Dixon, Vicki St. Elmo.

238
00:24:17,636 --> 00:24:21,633
Apparently I have a new team.

239
00:24:21,733 --> 00:24:26,120
Indeed.

240
00:24:31,612 --> 00:24:34,860
LAS VEGAS, NEVADA

241
00:24:43,435 --> 00:24:46,281
What are we doing here?
- Very simple ...

242
00:24:46,348 --> 00:24:48,792
This is Cunth.
If we want to find ...

243
00:24:48,893 --> 00:24:52,274
where the password deal takes place,
we must turn some stones.

244
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:55,489
Nice car, fart.
- Damn.

245
00:24:55,525 --> 00:25:00,612
K FBR 392.

246
00:25:00,613 --> 00:25:03,956
So we are contacts
and gather information?

247
00:25:04,056 --> 00:25:06,964
Something. K FBR 392.

248
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,017
Can I help you?
- The X5, please.

249
00:25:23,084 --> 00:25:25,629
He knows nothing.

250
00:25:29,215 --> 00:25:31,326
Turn the music.

251
00:25:31,459 --> 00:25:35,210
Turn off, or I will kill her.

252
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:40,332
I really do.
Nearly two in her neck.

253
00:25:40,366 --> 00:25:43,614
Do not worry, she's with me.

254
00:25:43,615 --> 00:25:47,365
But I can not say the same about you.

255
00:25:49,008 --> 00:25:51,285
Most of you are stuck here
on vacation.

256
00:25:51,787 --> 00:25:57,681
But many of you are connected
with Dieter Von Cunth.

257
00:25:58,048 --> 00:26:03,503
He would do something incredible illegal
and something amazing deadly thing.

258
00:26:03,538 --> 00:26:06,318
"Suspected of 'should I
say for legal purposes.

259
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:12,881
But I'll be after him
and go kill him.

260
00:26:12,916 --> 00:26:16,466
Who am I? You ask.

261
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:21,839
My name is MacGruber.
Remember that name.

262
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:30,148
Uppercase M.
a-c. Capital G. r-u-b-e-r.

263
00:26:33,183 --> 00:26:38,703
If someone wants to find:
Tomorrow at the Gold Street Cafe, 2 hours.

264
00:26:38,738 --> 00:26:42,437
Please spread the word
fucking millions.

265
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,178
That was fucking awesome.

266
00:26:48,212 --> 00:26:51,828
What was that?
- To send a message.

267
00:26:51,861 --> 00:26:54,640
It will be received loud and clear.

268
00:26:54,674 --> 00:26:56,976
Since I am worried about.
- Why?

269
00:26:57,076 --> 00:26:58,948
Because he thought you were dead.

270
00:26:59,048 --> 00:27:02,336
A huge advantage.
- Yes, now he comes after us.

271
00:27:02,436 --> 00:27:06,359
Exactly, part of the plan.
- What is that plan?

272
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:09,465
I making that up now.
- That's not really a plan.

273
00:27:09,565 --> 00:27:12,529
Or not, I'm not good with planning.

274
00:27:12,658 --> 00:27:14,835
Not even with directions.

275
00:27:14,868 --> 00:27:18,016
But with kick ass
and throats to rupture.

276
00:27:18,054 --> 00:27:23,933
So let him come in!
because I make him.

277
00:27:23,968 --> 00:27:27,831
And the action I will not lose.
Come on.

278
00:27:27,867 --> 00:27:31,882
K FBR 392.

279
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:42,563
Sorry to bother you, Dr. Cunth.
- Shoes.

280
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:44,941
Excuse me.

281
00:27:47,487 --> 00:27:51,438
A fool has broken tent beaten
and would chase you arrive.

282
00:27:51,471 --> 00:27:53,011
I'm afraid.

283
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:57,398
His name was MacGruber.

284
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:03,358
MacGruber.

285
00:28:04,664 --> 00:28:06,271
Well, well.

286
00:28:06,305 --> 00:28:10,256
Still alive after all these years.

287
00:28:13,272 --> 00:28:16,252
Bring him inside.
- I did not, sir.

288
00:28:18,094 --> 00:28:22,279
You let him go?
- He seemed to be no threat.

289
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:27,463
He seemed mentally disturbed.
- No threat ... Little question.

290
00:28:27,563 --> 00:28:30,563
Remember the murder
of President Jimmy Carter?

291
00:28:30,564 --> 00:28:34,169
No, but that never happened.
- That's right.

292
00:28:34,603 --> 00:28:38,688
Do not underestimate him.

293
00:28:39,391 --> 00:28:44,782
We have a fly on the lamp.
- Roger, what do we do?

294
00:28:44,815 --> 00:28:49,202
Provide whisk.
- Roger, sir.

295
00:28:59,587 --> 00:29:03,297
Your toilet is disgusting.
- Bite taken.

296
00:29:03,303 --> 00:29:04,376
Pretty good, right?

297
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:07,034
Can we talk about?
- There's nothing to say.

298
00:29:07,134 --> 00:29:11,548
Everyone knows that rats love cheese.
And you're the cheese.

299
00:29:11,648 --> 00:29:15,137
But he comes after you.
Why can not you see yourself?

300
00:29:15,237 --> 00:29:18,572
Because ... you do.

301
00:29:18,606 --> 00:29:21,211
I'm worried about this operation.

302
00:29:21,311 --> 00:29:25,482
If you think I'm that monster Cunth
let touch her hair ...

303
00:29:25,582 --> 00:29:27,714
you are mistaken enormous.
- Thanks.

304
00:29:27,784 --> 00:29:33,208
He comes down dangerously close to her.
And in this work may be things going on.

305
00:29:33,245 --> 00:29:36,456
But she gives herself.
- Will this really happen?

306
00:29:36,624 --> 00:29:38,600
Do not worry.

307
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,943
If you turn around a weapon against
and they see that I am not ...

308
00:29:42,043 --> 00:29:45,228
they are so angry that she
do not know what to do.

309
00:29:45,328 --> 00:29:47,440
Then you have them.

310
00:29:51,696 --> 00:29:55,078
What?
- You look so handsome.

311
00:29:55,714 --> 00:29:59,330
Thank you.
- Come on, Piper and MacGruber.

312
00:30:06,733 --> 00:30:12,391
Vick, if we want to attract bastard,
he must think you're the real MacGruber.

313
00:30:12,961 --> 00:30:15,639
Do not worry, we are backing you.

314
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:18,083
We are only seven blocks long,
if something goes wrong ...

315
00:30:18,184 --> 00:30:21,103
Seven streets?
- Okay, it's 20 blocks.

316
00:30:21,104 --> 00:30:24,576
But if something happens, we are so.
- Could not get closer?

317
00:30:24,647 --> 00:30:26,156
No.
- A lot.

318
00:30:26,189 --> 00:30:29,671
Yes, paid.

319
00:30:29,738 --> 00:30:34,962
I should stop talking
because people look at me weird.

320
00:30:34,995 --> 00:30:37,306
I do not want attention.

321
00:30:38,946 --> 00:30:45,426
And I stand at the bar,
so I'll order something.

322
00:30:45,461 --> 00:30:48,348
Can I help you?
- A small latte.

323
00:30:48,448 --> 00:30:51,028
No, that would never MacGruber order.

324
00:30:51,063 --> 00:30:54,824
It is the large Tazo tea.
- Excuse ...

325
00:30:54,859 --> 00:30:58,663
Can I change
a large Tazo tea?

326
00:30:58,772 --> 00:31:02,020
Of course, something else?
- No.

327
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:07,872
What is your name?
- Do not go in as the fog.

328
00:31:07,968 --> 00:31:11,362
MacGruber.
- Good.

329
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:18,227
That is 3.45.
- Yes, as always.

330
00:31:23,249 --> 00:31:26,799
No tip. Take that back.

331
00:31:27,301 --> 00:31:29,779
I need ...

332
00:31:36,548 --> 00:31:38,825
Sorry.
- Do not say sorry.

333
00:31:38,858 --> 00:31:44,785
No sorry. Well sorry for myself.

334
00:31:46,794 --> 00:31:51,482
Move to the end of the bar.
Something else.

335
00:31:51,515 --> 00:31:53,385
More ... Stop!

336
00:31:53,429 --> 00:31:55,471
MacGruber.
- That's me.

337
00:31:55,506 --> 00:31:59,226
This is the main piece.
Listen well.

338
00:31:59,261 --> 00:32:02,537
With your left hand go up.

339
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:07,190
Open your mouth and push up
until the liquid ...

340
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,634
Bending.

341
00:32:22,961 --> 00:32:26,041
We are going to die!

342
00:32:26,075 --> 00:32:29,755
Give me the Swiffer.
- I'm just busy.

343
00:32:29,791 --> 00:32:33,173
Damn, give me the Swiffer
and that's an order.

344
00:32:33,307 --> 00:32:36,488
All right.

345
00:32:39,405 --> 00:32:43,758
My God, no!

346
00:32:59,093 --> 00:33:02,006
No.

347
00:33:02,044 --> 00:33:05,637
Vicki?
- You still alive?

348
00:33:05,638 --> 00:33:08,187
Yes. Meet us in the alley.

349
00:33:24,494 --> 00:33:26,596
My teammates were shot.

350
00:33:32,024 --> 00:33:35,808
They are still alive. Seriously.

351
00:33:36,741 --> 00:33:39,051
Thank you.

352
00:33:41,127 --> 00:33:45,426
Good work with Swiffer.
- Would be good promotion for them.

353
00:33:45,461 --> 00:33:47,892
I'm not so sure.

354
00:33:50,067 --> 00:33:54,989
Hoss Bender, dead at age
"Who cares about".

355
00:33:56,965 --> 00:33:59,678
MacGruber.
- Vicki.

356
00:34:02,258 --> 00:34:06,142
I made me so concerned.
- I love to yours.

357
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:10,448
Really?
- I only have two of these jackets ...

358
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:13,135
So if one of the two
was fired was that bad.

359
00:34:13,136 --> 00:34:17,075
Not expensive, but hard to find.
- I see.

360
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:20,013
Hoss got his car found.

361
00:34:21,427 --> 00:34:23,169
Holy Mary.

362
00:34:23,202 --> 00:34:25,412
That is a lot of money.

363
00:34:25,513 --> 00:34:28,258
Every strip club is in his GPS.

364
00:34:28,291 --> 00:34:32,599
Hoss Bender, what were you from
plan with all that money.

365
00:34:33,216 --> 00:34:35,628
That is obvious.

366
00:34:36,666 --> 00:34:39,411
To passwords to buy ...
- The passwords buy ...

367
00:34:39,512 --> 00:34:44,982
I was just for you.
To purchase passwords.

368
00:34:45,005 --> 00:34:49,124
This is weird: He 's appointment
afternoon and there's only STD.

369
00:34:49,161 --> 00:34:50,866
Since I have been.

370
00:34:50,899 --> 00:34:55,821
STD is the old code
Stansfield track area, 16 km away.

371
00:34:55,854 --> 00:34:59,839
I put it in his GPS.

372
00:35:00,107 --> 00:35:05,196
He was of course already.
- Let's get passwords.

373
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,741
But if no show Hoss,
show them the bill.

374
00:35:07,842 --> 00:35:10,353
Who says he does not show up?

375
00:35:14,772 --> 00:35:17,126
Still some questions before we do this?

376
00:35:17,305 --> 00:35:20,360
Why should I be Hoss?
- You are good at what you do.

377
00:35:20,402 --> 00:35:23,850
Why do I have yours?
- First, you're never mine.

378
00:35:24,016 --> 00:35:28,322
Secondly, I forgot your question.

379
00:35:28,974 --> 00:35:31,425
There are three guards.

380
00:35:32,023 --> 00:35:35,086
Three against three.
- Once they are down ...

381
00:35:35,186 --> 00:35:41,197
Vicki goes in, dressed as Hoss
and see what happens.

382
00:35:41,231 --> 00:35:44,545
Ready?
- So we just go?

383
00:35:44,646 --> 00:35:48,898
Piper, that's a big difference
to see what happens.

384
00:35:48,931 --> 00:35:51,242
Let's see what happens.

385
00:35:52,618 --> 00:35:54,459
No thanks.
- What?

386
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,511
MacGruber plays like that.
So why.

387
00:35:58,645 --> 00:36:02,093
Sorry, I do not understand you.

388
00:36:02,128 --> 00:36:06,430
I do not use weapons.
- This is correct anyway.

389
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:09,434
Weapons for the weak
and idiots.

390
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:11,910
Not bad mean.

391
00:36:12,108 --> 00:36:14,586
What we have here.

392
00:36:16,327 --> 00:36:20,479
What are you doing?
- For distraction.

393
00:36:23,828 --> 00:36:27,109
What is that?

394
00:36:52,891 --> 00:36:55,536
Now.

395
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:04,930
Admittedly, that worked around.
- About?

396
00:37:04,965 --> 00:37:07,801
I have three great deal.
- Because I shot them.

397
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:09,275
Because they were derived.

398
00:37:09,309 --> 00:37:14,632
Here's some advice: If you ever try,
do you use the thick end ...

399
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:19,990
because the thin straight away ...
- You are wasting your time.

400
00:37:20,026 --> 00:37:22,668
I do not.

401
00:37:22,702 --> 00:37:25,246
Never say never.

402
00:37:25,448 --> 00:37:27,958
Follow me.

403
00:37:31,478 --> 00:37:34,070
That is Bach and Constantine Zeke Pleshette.

404
00:37:34,224 --> 00:37:37,002
And if I'm not mistaken,
what never was ...

405
00:37:37,538 --> 00:37:40,418
that bastard has bearing
Briefcase passwords.

406
00:37:41,389 --> 00:37:43,940
Vick, it's time.
- Is this real?

407
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,517
Funny, but walking.

408
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:51,972
I walk.

409
00:37:52,743 --> 00:37:55,121
There is nothing bad happened.

410
00:37:55,187 --> 00:37:57,833
I'm still alive.
- It's good ...

411
00:37:57,933 --> 00:38:00,947
This is just like in Nicaragua.
- There I was fired.

412
00:38:01,013 --> 00:38:03,659
This is nothing like in Nicaragua.

413
00:38:05,205 --> 00:38:10,859
I see through the window, I think.
Sit comfortably inside ...

414
00:38:10,894 --> 00:38:13,991
and fingers crossed.
This is so exciting.

415
00:38:15,366 --> 00:38:18,415
Go quietly by the entrance.

416
00:38:18,677 --> 00:38:21,455
And do not worry, they think
Hoss you're Bender.

417
00:38:21,556 --> 00:38:24,569
It takes a while before they realize ...
- It's not Hoss.

418
00:38:38,097 --> 00:38:41,579
What are you doing?
- A homemade grenade make.

419
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:50,358
I have to borrow to start the weapon.
- No.

420
00:38:50,459 --> 00:38:53,204
Use your finger.
- Watch your tone!

421
00:39:06,834 --> 00:39:10,150
Quietly, I have it under control.

422
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:22,842
Damn, they have the passwords.

423
00:39:23,378 --> 00:39:25,387
Hey, guys.
- Vicki.

424
00:39:25,487 --> 00:39:28,199
Are you okay?
- I lost money.

425
00:39:29,173 --> 00:39:33,225
I have peed my pants.
- Sorry.

426
00:39:34,698 --> 00:39:36,975
I've peed in it.

427
00:39:41,595 --> 00:39:44,877
Dirty.
- I got it washed.

428
00:39:45,984 --> 00:39:49,466
This phone is all we have.
- Here we get the most out best.

429
00:39:49,503 --> 00:39:52,547
Because at the moment is that our
any association with the X5.

430
00:39:53,083 --> 00:39:57,704
Damn, he goes off.
Turn on the tracer.

431
00:39:59,294 --> 00:40:02,013
He is ready.
- Remember ...

432
00:40:02,361 --> 00:40:05,104
long enough that you need to talk
to a location to obtain.

433
00:40:05,204 --> 00:40:07,162
I've done this before.

434
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:09,596
Listen, you piece of shit,
Hoss, and Zeke are dead ...

435
00:40:09,696 --> 00:40:11,876
and if you can not tell who this is ...
Hung, did you?

436
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:14,970
No.
- Damn, that thing works?

437
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:17,408
Yes, but you need it least
20 seconds on the line.

438
00:40:17,443 --> 00:40:19,403
That was twenty.
- Maybe three.

439
00:40:19,503 --> 00:40:21,461
You're right. Damn!

440
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:25,742
Second chance. Gotcha.
Listen to me, motherfucker ...

441
00:40:25,842 --> 00:40:28,157
Hoss, and Zeke are ...
My phone.

442
00:40:28,257 --> 00:40:29,997
Speak up.
- With Faith.

443
00:40:30,097 --> 00:40:33,365
Colonel, how are you?
- How is the mission?

444
00:40:33,465 --> 00:40:38,087
Very positive, not boys?
How are things in the Pentagon?

445
00:40:38,122 --> 00:40:40,603
We do have a clue
you probably already knew.

446
00:40:40,703 --> 00:40:46,726
Cunth has a fundraising evening.
- We know indeed.

447
00:40:46,826 --> 00:40:50,011
And we will be making calls.
- Absolutely not.

448
00:40:50,111 --> 00:40:52,106
I'm not calling to bear.

449
00:40:52,206 --> 00:40:56,267
You do not go to that party,
because he sees you dead.

450
00:40:56,367 --> 00:40:59,568
That is a big advantage.
- Yes.

451
00:40:59,668 --> 00:41:04,266
This is a private party.
I want to know exactly who enters.

452
00:41:04,366 --> 00:41:06,586
Clear.

453
00:41:09,621 --> 00:41:16,573
So keep Cunth 's party?
- Yes, and guess who is on the list?

454
00:41:19,791 --> 00:41:22,466
Guess.
- We.

455
00:41:25,532 --> 00:41:28,617
SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH

456
00:41:28,656 --> 00:41:31,786
I think this is stupid.
- No problem ...

457
00:41:31,886 --> 00:41:34,749
We keep our heads down.

458
00:41:58,774 --> 00:42:00,373
Can I take your coat?
- No.

459
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,967
Your car?
- Nice try.

460
00:42:08,866 --> 00:42:11,505
Our definition on keeping low profile
are slightly different.

461
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:14,025
Do you? Where's Vicki?

462
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:16,495
Arrived ten minutes ago.
She is at the back.

463
00:42:16,669 --> 00:42:21,058
I like her so well.
First, do something else.

464
00:42:21,502 --> 00:42:25,136
Gruber, answer.

465
00:42:38,569 --> 00:42:41,641
DIRECTIONS

466
00:42:44,716 --> 00:42:48,220
KFBR392

467
00:43:34,117 --> 00:43:35,752
Where have you been?
- Sorry ...

468
00:43:35,787 --> 00:43:38,423
slightly above a biplane made
in the large bathroom.

469
00:43:38,458 --> 00:43:41,632
Dekker above?
- Defecate in the water.

470
00:43:41,732 --> 00:43:45,774
You look beautiful.
- Thanks.

471
00:43:46,515 --> 00:43:51,527
Vick, go around to look
what you can discover.

472
00:43:51,627 --> 00:43:53,958
Already done.
You see that guy over there?

473
00:43:54,058 --> 00:43:56,837
He is from the office of Cunth.
He is one of the guards.

474
00:43:57,004 --> 00:43:59,795
Which guy?
- That handsome.

475
00:44:00,045 --> 00:44:02,748
Do you find pretty?

476
00:44:02,941 --> 00:44:06,723
Yes, he is very handsome.
- Really.

477
00:44:06,823 --> 00:44:09,608
Why do not you loyal to him?

478
00:44:09,643 --> 00:44:14,645
Seriously, then marry him.
Leave the mission.

479
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:20,140
He is so handsome that you want to give up your job?
- No.

480
00:44:20,175 --> 00:44:21,530
Well done.

481
00:44:21,614 --> 00:44:25,970
That guy you have to check.
Hold much info.

482
00:44:26,498 --> 00:44:30,099
What?
- Take him and tie 'n order.

483
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,954
And stay away from him,
I have described as ugly ...

484
00:44:33,054 --> 00:44:35,328
and that's' s command.
So two orders.

485
00:44:35,363 --> 00:44:38,869
Piper, Cunth you found?
- In the South Wing.

486
00:44:38,904 --> 00:44:40,546
Way.

487
00:44:40,581 --> 00:44:43,002
That guy.

488
00:44:46,837 --> 00:44:51,457
I follow 20 000
and increase to 50 000.

489
00:44:54,064 --> 00:44:56,086
He's bluffing.

490
00:44:56,645 --> 00:45:01,134
I see in his small, bead-shaped eyes.

491
00:45:01,276 --> 00:45:05,861
We've been expecting you al
- Your turn, Senator Garver.

492
00:45:09,129 --> 00:45:15,917
I participate.
- Senator note for $ 750,000.

493
00:45:19,802 --> 00:45:22,360
Straight Flush.
- Damn.

494
00:45:22,467 --> 00:45:26,908
My guard will help you out.

495
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:33,597
Sorry about that.
I really thought he was bluffing.

496
00:45:33,632 --> 00:45:37,772
Thanks, you've got me just a little
made richer than I already am.

497
00:45:37,807 --> 00:45:41,312
It does do something interesting.

498
00:45:41,347 --> 00:45:44,676
Your companion is a beautiful woman.
- Thank you.

499
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:48,158
Hopefully you like raped.
- This is my daughter.

500
00:45:48,264 --> 00:45:50,397
Hello.

501
00:45:51,108 --> 00:45:55,566
Sorry, he killed my wife.
- Excuse us here.

502
00:46:00,352 --> 00:46:04,157
Where is the X5?
- What are you talking about?

503
00:46:04,257 --> 00:46:07,884
Where is the damn rocket?
- What should I do with 's nuclear missile?

504
00:46:08,576 --> 00:46:11,243
I never said anything about nuclear.

505
00:46:11,278 --> 00:46:14,187
Precisely because most rockets
filled with air.

506
00:46:15,471 --> 00:46:19,059
I came Zeke Pleshette
Hoss and Bender on at last.

507
00:46:19,096 --> 00:46:22,365
How are they?
- Less than dead now.

508
00:46:22,435 --> 00:46:25,100
This is unfortunate.
- Too bad for you.

509
00:46:25,172 --> 00:46:27,518
Because they were part of your
little dream team of criminals, right?

510
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:32,528
Yes, they 'were' in the past.
Very sad story.

511
00:46:32,734 --> 00:46:33,540
Why?

512
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:37,177
I did have the dream team
criminals in the world made ...

513
00:46:37,277 --> 00:46:39,020
and she sat in a room.

514
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:43,776
And I had some homemade C4
that suddenly exploded.

515
00:46:44,028 --> 00:46:47,140
And I'm lost.
- It kidding?

516
00:46:47,294 --> 00:46:50,347
We have much in common.
I did about the same.

517
00:46:50,447 --> 00:46:55,082
No, I was not, because I
'm not an idiot who does something.

518
00:46:55,182 --> 00:46:58,584
Fuck you, Cunth.
I have a new team now.

519
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:01,778
Outside Vicki St. Elmo,
Perhaps you have heard of her ...

520
00:47:01,883 --> 00:47:05,656
I have one of the best
young military minds.

521
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:07,769
This guy is the real stuff.

522
00:47:07,869 --> 00:47:11,805
We will stop you.
- You have a lot of imagination ...

523
00:47:11,905 --> 00:47:17,317
but I know nothing about a nuclear missile.
- You're lying.

524
00:47:17,557 --> 00:47:20,355
And you're a piece of shit.
- We're done here.

525
00:47:20,455 --> 00:47:23,461
Would you accompany Mr. MacGruber out?

526
00:47:23,548 --> 00:47:25,839
You know what will happen?

527
00:47:25,874 --> 00:47:29,879
I kick you from your chin, break your jaw
at four locations ...

528
00:47:29,985 --> 00:47:33,762
karate and then I'll flip on my back,
and put your nose in your brains ...

529
00:47:33,862 --> 00:47:38,579
which killed instantly. I want someone
throat cracks ... And in so doing.

530
00:47:38,686 --> 00:47:41,671
One thing I know,
at the end of the day ...

531
00:47:41,707 --> 00:47:46,429
I rip your dick off, and push it in your mouth.
There is nothing to negotiate.

532
00:47:46,464 --> 00:47:48,966
Who's first?

533
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:54,647
My back.

534
00:47:57,311 --> 00:48:02,855
This is a Blaupunkt.
You owe me a Blaupunkt.

535
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,291
Where's Vicki?

536
00:48:11,463 --> 00:48:15,087
I'm not sure I can do this.
- Vicki, where are you?

537
00:48:15,124 --> 00:48:18,321
Do it for your family.

538
00:48:19,137 --> 00:48:21,860
My family?
- Good night, Senator.

539
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:24,237
I swung out through a window.

540
00:48:24,273 --> 00:48:28,768
My Blaupunkt, I'm really pissed off.

541
00:48:28,821 --> 00:48:31,857
I'm talking to Senator Constantine Garver.

542
00:48:31,884 --> 00:48:36,597
Glad you have so much fun with to
those pretty boys at a party look.

543
00:48:36,632 --> 00:48:41,053
But there is a nuclear threat, and we
all possible help.

544
00:48:41,088 --> 00:48:44,393
Please come back here.
- All right.

545
00:48:46,543 --> 00:48:49,726
First fun party.

546
00:48:49,761 --> 00:48:52,676
The music, dancing
and excellent sushi.

547
00:48:52,776 --> 00:48:57,810
Especially the humiliation by MacGruber
the eyes of my daughter and guests.

548
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:02,150
Does anyone know how he could get in?
- Via the main entrance.

549
00:49:02,151 --> 00:49:07,071
I had expected something more complicated.

550
00:49:07,072 --> 00:49:10,587
Sorry, sir.
- No apologies.

551
00:49:10,687 --> 00:49:15,205
I appreciate your honesty.
To the left, please.

552
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:18,012
Great.

553
00:49:19,212 --> 00:49:21,987
Would anyone else be honest?

554
00:49:21,988 --> 00:49:26,851
Hang on in the hall.
And go MacGruber finish.

555
00:49:29,505 --> 00:49:34,979
I said do not go inside.
- I have them where I want them.

556
00:49:35,028 --> 00:49:37,717
Is that so?
I think the other way.

557
00:49:37,752 --> 00:49:39,895
To agree to disagree.

558
00:49:40,825 --> 00:49:47,804
I'm really sorry.
- That save us from the nuclear rocket.

559
00:49:51,108 --> 00:49:53,669
You become a risk.

560
00:49:53,769 --> 00:49:57,959
I have no choice
then you pick up this mission ...

561
00:49:57,994 --> 00:50:01,841
and this time it really happens.
- He now has the passwords.

562
00:50:01,941 --> 00:50:06,263
Because you could hold against him.
- You can not do.

563
00:50:06,363 --> 00:50:09,065
I can do and that
I just did.

564
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:30,685
I will suck your dick.
I let you fuck me.

565
00:50:31,405 --> 00:50:34,461
I'm sorry, Mac.
It's over.

566
00:50:39,731 --> 00:50:42,823
I must be held on the envelope
think that Senator Garver received.

567
00:50:42,858 --> 00:50:48,209
There is a designation.
- Cute that you were still thinking ...

568
00:50:48,309 --> 00:50:52,569
but believe me, Garver has nothing.

569
00:50:52,604 --> 00:50:56,319
I am sorry
- You do not regret anything about it.

570
00:50:56,462 --> 00:51:01,102
You both did a great job.
If anyone should have to blame ...

571
00:51:01,122 --> 00:51:04,256
than I am.
- If it comforts you ...

572
00:51:04,458 --> 00:51:07,497
I have spent the last days
learned a lot from you.

573
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:13,270
Mostly about what not to do, but
this is an important part of learning.

574
00:51:13,366 --> 00:51:16,016
I go to the toilet.
- Number one, or two?

575
00:51:16,051 --> 00:51:19,355
That's your business.
- That means number two.

576
00:51:19,455 --> 00:51:21,594
Shut up.

577
00:51:23,948 --> 00:51:27,218
When you doing something?
- What are you talking about?

578
00:51:27,318 --> 00:51:31,052
You can see a mile away.
- Shut up.

579
00:51:31,152 --> 00:51:36,118
Seriously, you're perfect for each other.
- You're crazy.

580
00:51:36,153 --> 00:51:42,965
She is a good woman.
Loyalty, good at what she does.

581
00:51:43,065 --> 00:51:49,243
Great body, dresses well.
Talented lyricist.

582
00:51:49,343 --> 00:51:54,040
But I can say with confidence
it never is between Vicki and me.

583
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:58,167
Never say never.
- No.

584
00:51:58,267 --> 00:52:00,802
I can this time.

585
00:52:00,872 --> 00:52:04,830
After Casey, I made a promise
I no longer need other women.

586
00:52:06,926 --> 00:52:11,866
That must be really difficult.
Why did Cunth killed her?

587
00:52:11,966 --> 00:52:14,840
I still have no idea.

588
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:22,417
We all went to school together.
And we were really very good friends.

589
00:52:23,969 --> 00:52:27,203
After his graduation,
he is her betrothed.

590
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:30,578
He asked if I wanted to be his witness.

591
00:52:30,614 --> 00:52:36,757
Around that time I began to fuck her.

592
00:52:36,792 --> 00:52:39,883
She was the only thing I'm so
I felt at ease at ...

593
00:52:41,127 --> 00:52:44,076
let me go.

594
00:52:45,051 --> 00:52:50,345
Anyway, shortly thereafter
She left him for me.

595
00:52:50,958 --> 00:52:54,549
She was pregnant with him.

596
00:52:54,584 --> 00:52:58,966
I asked her to abort,
so we could start over again.

597
00:52:59,001 --> 00:53:01,012
She agrees.

598
00:53:03,115 --> 00:53:05,518
We were so in love.

599
00:53:06,528 --> 00:53:10,346
He has taken me.
- This is really fucked.

600
00:53:10,381 --> 00:53:12,819
Thanks.

601
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:18,553
You're a good man.
I must apologize for anything.

602
00:53:18,588 --> 00:53:21,786
That is not necessary.
- Yes.

603
00:53:21,821 --> 00:53:24,948
I have you treated so badly.

604
00:53:25,618 --> 00:53:29,776
I think I threatened
felt by you.

605
00:53:30,451 --> 00:53:33,186
I am not used
I feel so.

606
00:53:35,141 --> 00:53:37,340
I'm fucking MacGruber.

607
00:53:39,782 --> 00:53:42,305
Water after bad.
- You know.

608
00:53:42,589 --> 00:53:46,391
You know it.
- Another beer?

609
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:53,326
What?
- We got company.

610
00:53:53,971 --> 00:53:58,666
Piper, no!

611
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:22,522
Is he dead?
- Yes, he's dead.

612
00:54:27,781 --> 00:54:29,770
I thought we were the dick.

613
00:54:29,806 --> 00:54:32,861
How did you know I was wearing a bulletproof vest?
- Are you wearing that?

614
00:54:33,097 --> 00:54:35,356
Awesome.
- Did you know?

615
00:54:35,391 --> 00:54:40,572
I knew all the time al
- Pull over and let me out.

616
00:54:40,672 --> 00:54:44,851
No. Why?
- Because you've used me as a human shield.

617
00:54:44,951 --> 00:54:46,225
I have not done.
- Yes.

618
00:54:46,381 --> 00:54:50,005
I have him as a human shield?
- A little bit though.

619
00:54:50,041 --> 00:54:53,025
You exaggerate
- Step aside.

620
00:54:53,737 --> 00:54:56,082
Step aside.
- Fine.

621
00:54:59,407 --> 00:55:02,777
Stairs to my car just now?
- You do not.

622
00:55:02,815 --> 00:55:05,690
Very mature!

623
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:10,781
Fuck, MacGruber.
- Bye, Piper.

624
00:55:23,047 --> 00:55:26,102
Is everything okay?
- Yes.

625
00:55:28,484 --> 00:55:30,971
What has happened to your leg?

626
00:55:31,983 --> 00:55:34,867
That's nothing.
- You're fired.

627
00:55:34,902 --> 00:55:36,999
But who had gone through my head.
- Do not say that.

628
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:40,646
Come inside,
then we get that bullet out.

629
00:55:48,287 --> 00:55:51,034
That punctured some.

630
00:55:55,829 --> 00:55:59,453
I'm going to remove the bullet.
You want to bite?

631
00:55:59,596 --> 00:56:02,403
I deserve pain.

632
00:56:10,475 --> 00:56:13,602
I do not know what happened.

633
00:56:14,525 --> 00:56:19,073
I was just crazy.
- Everyone makes mistakes.

634
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:22,885
No. Not me.

635
00:56:22,947 --> 00:56:25,014
He is not dead.
- But that would have been possible.

636
00:56:25,114 --> 00:56:28,227
You're too hard on yourself.
- Perhaps the Colonel right.

637
00:56:29,212 --> 00:56:31,692
Maybe I can not.

638
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:38,544
Why do you stay?

639
00:56:38,607 --> 00:56:41,236
Because I believe in what you do.
- Is that so?

640
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:42,594
Yes.

641
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:46,057
You're a wonderful man.

642
00:56:46,271 --> 00:56:49,002
You're beautiful.
A great body ...

643
00:56:49,102 --> 00:56:52,249
a great style.
You are smart and brave.

644
00:56:53,769 --> 00:56:56,896
Casey was lucky to have someone like
if you had.

645
00:56:57,003 --> 00:57:00,769
You're also a very special woman.

646
00:57:02,049 --> 00:57:04,856
Why have you not settled?

647
00:57:05,759 --> 00:57:08,779
I have only held one man.

648
00:57:09,135 --> 00:57:14,548
He was already occupied.
- Is he married?

649
00:57:14,711 --> 00:57:18,016
He was.
She is still in his heart.

650
00:57:18,051 --> 00:57:20,432
God bless her.

651
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:25,817
I hope he does not assign blame
to be blown during the wedding.

652
00:57:27,208 --> 00:57:32,075
Maybe one day you have the courage to
tell him how you feel.

653
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:35,390
Maybe.

654
00:57:37,349 --> 00:57:39,943
Gotcha.

655
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:44,686
MacGruber.
- Sorry.

656
00:57:45,559 --> 00:57:51,575
I always get an erection as a beautiful
Women pincers along my balls used.

657
00:57:53,392 --> 00:57:56,823
Thank you.

658
00:57:59,313 --> 00:58:05,831
I'll sew it.
- No. Leave it open.

659
00:58:06,744 --> 00:58:10,414
I like holes.

660
00:58:11,924 --> 00:58:17,961
I am a virgin.
- Not for long.

661
00:59:11,030 --> 00:59:14,113
I'm going to explode inside you.
I am going to waste.

662
00:59:14,114 --> 00:59:17,550
I'm going to fill you.
- I will fill you.

663
00:59:17,551 --> 00:59:19,467
What?
- I will fill you.

664
00:59:19,468 --> 00:59:22,589
Let me talk.

665
01:00:12,797 --> 01:00:14,567
You're amazing.
- I gotta go.

666
01:00:14,609 --> 01:00:18,245
What is it?
- I gotta go.

667
01:00:31,075 --> 01:00:33,168
Wait.

668
01:00:45,635 --> 01:00:50,952
I'm sorry, Casey.
I'm with another woman that theater.

669
01:00:50,986 --> 01:00:54,245
It feels like I've betrayed you.

670
01:00:55,942 --> 01:00:58,445
It is good, MacGruber.

671
01:00:59,921 --> 01:01:02,322
Casey?
- It's good.

672
01:01:02,356 --> 01:01:04,740
Go with Vicki.

673
01:01:05,490 --> 01:01:09,640
I can not do that.
- You should continue your life.

674
01:01:12,439 --> 01:01:15,184
I do not know what to say.

675
01:01:17,996 --> 01:01:20,330
Say nothing.

676
01:01:57,935 --> 01:02:00,963
I'm going to shoot.
- Me too.

677
01:02:01,187 --> 01:02:03,740
We shoot together.

678
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:28,188
I've shot.
- Me too.

679
01:02:29,615 --> 01:02:33,954
Now go tell Vicki
what you feel for her.

680
01:02:36,443 --> 01:02:39,104
I will do that.

681
01:02:50,614 --> 01:02:53,262
Thanks.

682
01:03:05,033 --> 01:03:08,586
What are the chances?

683
01:03:14,378 --> 01:03:16,265
With Grubes.
- MacGruber ...

684
01:03:16,505 --> 01:03:20,999
I wanted you excuse me
and you tell the good news.

685
01:03:21,034 --> 01:03:24,704
Good news?
I'm all ears.

686
01:03:24,739 --> 01:03:28,650
We have just heard that the Russian
Special Forces have found the X5.

687
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:29,964
That's great.

688
01:03:30,064 --> 01:03:32,955
I want to be there when you Cunth
deal takes.

689
01:03:33,055 --> 01:03:37,618
He was not involved.
They were Chechen rebels.

690
01:03:37,643 --> 01:03:41,522
You're wrong that you're wrong.
This is Cunth his work.

691
01:03:42,174 --> 01:03:44,438
He is clean, Mac.

692
01:03:44,678 --> 01:03:47,138
Yes, clean as a varkenslul.

693
01:03:47,319 --> 01:03:51,265
This should be a kind of distraction,
so that he can use the X5.

694
01:03:51,299 --> 01:03:53,844
And I suspect that he
The quick use.

695
01:03:53,991 --> 01:03:58,147
I do not know what he will do.
- STATE OF THE UNION TONIGHT

696
01:04:01,699 --> 01:04:07,600
Cunth, the State of the Union bombardment.
- The information comes from a reliable source.

697
01:04:07,693 --> 01:04:10,273
Do me a favor and take holidays.

698
01:04:10,308 --> 01:04:13,495
Go to the beach, shoes
and drink some Molson.

699
01:04:13,530 --> 01:04:15,825
I have a better idea.

700
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:19,130
I'm going to save the world.

701
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:30,896
Fuck you, asshole.
- That's my car.

702
01:04:36,379 --> 01:04:41,148
Senator, tell me again where you
this information from you.

703
01:04:41,709 --> 01:04:45,311
I'm sorry, Jim.
I have no choice.

704
01:04:53,201 --> 01:04:56,171
I am so sorry, Vicki.

705
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:13,478
Songs for my Gruber.
Vicki, anyway.

706
01:05:17,212 --> 01:05:20,162
Vicki, where are you?
- Hello, MacGruber.

707
01:05:20,196 --> 01:05:23,320
What have you done with Vicki?

708
01:05:23,355 --> 01:05:26,302
I have not seen her, I
came only from her mobile phone.

709
01:05:26,542 --> 01:05:30,385
I know what you plan.

710
01:05:30,522 --> 01:05:33,712
If you care anything about Vicki's
phone gives you stay away.

711
01:05:33,815 --> 01:05:40,492
Otherwise, I throw him to pieces.
- I understand.

712
01:05:40,494 --> 01:05:43,718
Vicki Vicki's cell phone is, right?
- Bye.

713
01:05:43,818 --> 01:05:49,420
Dieter, wait.
I just wanted to say ...

714
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:52,877
it was fun to meet you ...

715
01:05:53,118 --> 01:05:59,127
and we damn good opponents.

716
01:05:59,231 --> 01:06:05,679
And thanks for being there, dude.

717
01:06:06,091 --> 01:06:10,368
I had not expected. Thanks.
- Anything else ...

718
01:06:12,191 --> 01:06:14,061
How shall I say.

719
01:06:17,821 --> 01:06:22,930
I can not wait for your dick there
to cut in your mouth and pushing.

720
01:06:23,030 --> 01:06:25,379
Goodbye, MacGruber.

721
01:06:26,769 --> 01:06:29,685
Time to kick some Cunth.

722
01:07:14,046 --> 01:07:19,084
Thanks for doing this, Piper.
And I'm sorry about last night.

723
01:07:19,122 --> 01:07:21,006
That was a pretty stupid move.

724
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:25,534
Let's get something straight.
I do this not for you.

725
01:07:25,568 --> 01:07:28,643
I do it for all those innocent people
whose life is at stake.

726
01:07:29,111 --> 01:07:33,742
My life is also at stake,
So you do it for me.

727
01:07:33,776 --> 01:07:36,309
And I thank you for.
- You know what?

728
01:07:36,344 --> 01:07:41,078
Stop. You only talk,
and you screwed up things.

729
01:07:41,181 --> 01:07:44,062
Articles by tearing.
- I doubt it really.

730
01:07:44,097 --> 01:07:46,297
Then you will see.

731
01:07:46,332 --> 01:07:50,321
Is that so?
- Yes. And it also.

732
01:07:51,315 --> 01:07:54,505
Sorry to bother you.
Colonel?

733
01:07:55,740 --> 01:07:57,628
Colonel.

734
01:08:01,618 --> 01:08:04,797
MacGruber was right.

735
01:08:16,366 --> 01:08:20,809
Eleven, twelve as I can see.

736
01:08:20,844 --> 01:08:22,507
Inside there will be more.

737
01:08:22,542 --> 01:08:25,937
I hope they have a ditch
for all bodies.

738
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:29,299
Otherwise, this later
very smelly.

739
01:08:29,403 --> 01:08:32,490
Dirty way to view it.
- I am realistic.

740
01:08:32,627 --> 01:08:36,595
How many people do you murder?

741
01:08:38,565 --> 01:08:41,687
Let him pass.
We do not want attention.

742
01:08:54,114 --> 01:08:57,544
Cool, huh?
You had not expected.

743
01:08:57,579 --> 01:09:00,508
That was really disgusting.

744
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:03,168
Touch is used to it.
So I will.

745
01:09:03,203 --> 01:09:06,498
He had done the same to me
if he had the chance.

746
01:09:06,533 --> 01:09:10,375
He would have shot you.
- Lie.

747
01:09:11,708 --> 01:09:14,143
That was too close.
We should have a new entry point.

748
01:09:14,177 --> 01:09:15,995
Come on.

749
01:09:17,822 --> 01:09:21,973
Vicki, always the bridesmaid.
Never the bride.

750
01:09:24,099 --> 01:09:26,638
What?
I understand you.

751
01:09:26,673 --> 01:09:29,417
Stop it where the sun does not shine.

752
01:09:29,452 --> 01:09:31,646
And where is that?

753
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:37,867
In your asshole?

754
01:09:37,936 --> 01:09:41,476
This is back. I know
MacGruber sitting behind you.

755
01:09:41,576 --> 01:09:43,231
And I can not wait.
You know why?

756
01:09:43,331 --> 01:09:47,751
I want him to look how I killed you.
Just before him.

757
01:09:47,851 --> 01:09:52,426
And then I look how I killed him.
For a mirror.

758
01:09:52,507 --> 01:09:57,781
And then I watch TV.
Hopefully something good on.

759
01:09:59,468 --> 01:10:03,346
This will be one of the most anticipated
State of the Union from the history.

760
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:07,149
It is told that the president ...

761
01:10:07,342 --> 01:10:11,080
I love disaster movies.

762
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:23,462
And then I said to her: Not too long.
And then we rammed.

763
01:10:23,463 --> 01:10:25,325
What?
- I banged her.

764
01:10:25,326 --> 01:10:29,065
I would not use the N-word,
because it was something beautiful.

765
01:10:29,066 --> 01:10:34,076
But it was great.
And so it never felt.

766
01:10:34,077 --> 01:10:37,847
That sounds special.
This seems the main pipe.

767
01:10:37,848 --> 01:10:40,918
We are under control.

768
01:10:40,953 --> 01:10:44,085
Ready?
- What Cunth kick.

769
01:10:45,831 --> 01:10:47,595
What?
- Nothing.

770
01:10:47,596 --> 01:10:52,595
No, tell me.
- The phrase you always say.

771
01:10:52,596 --> 01:10:54,287
It's a good sentence.
- Yes?

772
01:10:54,288 --> 01:10:57,816
Yes, I know good sentences.
And I can well.

773
01:10:57,916 --> 01:11:01,692
Even a sense of defeat when I Cunth.

774
01:11:01,870 --> 01:11:03,988
Become awesome.
- Can not wait.

775
01:11:04,023 --> 01:11:07,531
Yes, you will hear.
I'll look ...

776
01:11:07,532 --> 01:11:09,631
and you'll know.
- Are we?

777
01:11:11,933 --> 01:11:15,809
I first. No, go ahead.

778
01:11:17,467 --> 01:11:22,510
Miller, you receive me?
Miller, are you?

779
01:11:22,583 --> 01:11:25,353
Damn, Miller.

780
01:11:27,014 --> 01:11:29,483
Throat Tablets?
- Take the whole box only.

781
01:11:31,542 --> 01:11:34,835
Great.
Another throat torn.

782
01:11:35,007 --> 01:11:37,613
Great.
- Perhaps you want for the turkey?

783
01:11:37,648 --> 01:11:41,936
Turkey?
- A bowling term for three strikes in a row.

784
01:11:41,971 --> 01:11:44,973
I say this for throat tearing.
- That's sick.

785
01:11:45,075 --> 01:11:48,471
Maybe. But if I
throat cracks nuclear missile get back ...

786
01:11:48,505 --> 01:11:52,588
pipe so many dicks ...
I tear through as many throats as needed.

787
01:11:52,684 --> 01:11:55,400
Did you hear that?
- No.

788
01:11:57,208 --> 01:11:58,409
Look.

789
01:11:58,443 --> 01:12:04,433
Hey, Cunth. Guess.
I, MacGruber.

790
01:12:04,533 --> 01:12:07,324
With my brother from another mother.

791
01:12:08,915 --> 01:12:11,899
Let me do this.
Let me go.

792
01:12:11,933 --> 01:12:16,565
'm Back, asshole.
- Kill him.

793
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:20,647
We are only two of us
in the control room.

794
01:12:20,681 --> 01:12:22,774
Make room, now.

795
01:12:22,843 --> 01:12:29,361
Come to the control because
We have a surprise for you.

796
01:12:46,217 --> 01:12:50,234
You are all NAT

797
01:12:50,979 --> 01:12:53,585
Pretty good idea, right?

798
01:12:54,306 --> 01:12:57,942
What? The idea seems
water or ambush?

799
01:12:58,231 --> 01:13:01,284
You really fun.
Trust me ...

800
01:13:01,388 --> 01:13:04,441
that will provide us time.

801
01:13:04,464 --> 01:13:08,135
They are in the engine.
- Come on.

802
01:13:23,072 --> 01:13:27,652
I have all these Wrench
and I have this bottle cap.

803
01:13:27,687 --> 01:13:30,955
Watch out for a big egg.

804
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:33,397
Shut up, MacGruber.

805
01:13:36,736 --> 01:13:40,578
I try to help.
- Take two of these weapons.

806
01:13:40,681 --> 01:13:43,357
I said I do not use weapons.

807
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:47,443
Then start your best, because celery
in your ass stabbing will not help now.

808
01:13:47,538 --> 01:13:49,366
I do not use weapons!
- Why?

809
01:13:49,401 --> 01:13:50,954
Why!

810
01:13:50,989 --> 01:13:55,656
I do not know how.
- Unbelievable.

811
01:13:55,724 --> 01:13:58,250
They frighten me.
- Want to save Vicki?

812
01:14:00,036 --> 01:14:04,701
Well, what should I do?
- Aim and shoot.

813
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:12,615
I've hit a ton.
- Focus on a person.

814
01:14:12,718 --> 01:14:13,849
Good idea.

815
01:14:18,681 --> 01:14:23,014
I had that guy. Seen?
- I had him, I think. But well done.

816
01:14:23,049 --> 01:14:26,755
I think I'll finish two.
- No, I want to do it.

817
01:14:30,185 --> 01:14:34,816
This is so great. Far better
than all the gadgets that I made.

818
01:14:35,159 --> 01:14:37,800
We must go out that door.
I count to three.

819
01:14:37,903 --> 01:14:41,230
Whatever you do, keep shooting.

820
01:14:41,626 --> 01:14:43,444
Ready?
- Just keep shooting.

821
01:14:43,856 --> 01:14:47,663
Good.
- One, two, three.

822
01:15:15,162 --> 01:15:19,004
That was sipping.
Where are the weapons?

823
01:15:21,023 --> 01:15:24,441
We have company.

824
01:15:24,478 --> 01:15:26,859
No!

825
01:15:30,779 --> 01:15:36,187
Nice shot.
Therefore it is dead solid.

826
01:15:37,435 --> 01:15:40,625
You really want to rip throats, huh?

827
01:15:41,105 --> 01:15:45,976
Yes, but I know
that you do not fancy.

828
01:15:46,491 --> 01:15:50,638
Go for the turkey.

829
01:15:51,144 --> 01:15:53,612
Really?
- Yes.

830
01:15:53,787 --> 01:15:56,428
Thanks.
- No, thank you.

831
01:15:56,532 --> 01:15:59,825
That you wanted to save my life.
- That I owe you.

832
01:15:59,927 --> 01:16:02,912
Hand out.

833
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:21,093
Vicki is in there.
I feel it in my balls.

834
01:16:25,948 --> 01:16:28,452
The game is over.

835
01:16:32,328 --> 01:16:35,005
MacGruber.

836
01:16:36,651 --> 01:16:38,027
Just in time.

837
01:16:38,062 --> 01:16:40,737
You want a prank ticker
or Molson?

838
01:16:40,771 --> 01:16:42,727
We have a substantial Costco here.

839
01:16:42,761 --> 01:16:45,057
Food will be hard to find ...

840
01:16:45,094 --> 01:16:48,730
so we have enough
for a little nuclear winter.

841
01:16:48,764 --> 01:16:52,594
Constantine, you take these two along
while I make fun of ...

842
01:16:52,788 --> 01:16:57,092
MacGruber here.
- Yes.

843
01:16:57,093 --> 01:16:58,505
Kneel.

844
01:16:58,724 --> 01:17:02,343
First I want to thank you for
bowman above you.

845
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:07,535
I want you so bad deaths.

846
01:17:07,638 --> 01:17:10,794
Help me, Mommy. Go MacGruber
tear my throat?

847
01:17:10,897 --> 01:17:14,807
I want you to remain very sore so I
You can hear a scream ...

848
01:17:14,844 --> 01:17:17,967
I have cut off your dick in your mouth push.
Tonight.

849
01:17:18,010 --> 01:17:22,126
That sounds nice, but I
I have other plans.

850
01:17:22,164 --> 01:17:26,133
In four minutes I'm DC
transform into ashes.

851
01:17:26,233 --> 01:17:30,493
Then tons of money counting.
- How do you kill such people?

852
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:34,409
Was not that obvious?
Someone paid me for it.

853
01:17:34,725 --> 01:17:37,982
I can not say who, that's gossip.
A Chinese.

854
01:17:38,237 --> 01:17:41,735
You leave me disgusted.
You can not do.

855
01:17:41,835 --> 01:17:44,085
Right, because you do that.

856
01:17:44,118 --> 01:17:45,769
You're crazy.
- No, you.

857
01:17:45,803 --> 01:17:49,807
The illusion of a government
accusing you of her death.

858
01:17:50,093 --> 01:17:57,855
You dirty woman you put in the back.
- You killed Casey.

859
01:17:57,915 --> 01:17:59,858
Not according to your manifesto.

860
01:18:00,265 --> 01:18:03,811
What are you talking about?
- Your manifesto.

861
01:18:04,113 --> 01:18:09,219
Here you accuse the government.
- ROT OP AMERICA

862
01:18:09,254 --> 01:18:11,635
I'll give you your wages.

863
01:18:11,670 --> 01:18:14,766
Cunth, you must believe
that I did not write.

864
01:18:14,801 --> 01:18:18,136
I'm getting tricked by someone.
You have to believe me.

865
01:18:18,174 --> 01:18:22,084
This is a big misunderstanding.
- God, I wrote that.

866
01:18:22,121 --> 01:18:25,755
I lock you in it.
- It never fails.

867
01:18:25,857 --> 01:18:31,439
Colonel Faith knows all about this.
- It's dead.

868
01:18:31,495 --> 01:18:33,213
What?
- You're lying.

869
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:38,873
Damn, Cunth.
- That 's invitation?

870
01:18:38,876 --> 01:18:40,760
No ...

871
01:18:41,651 --> 01:18:43,549
Let's go.

872
01:18:43,596 --> 01:18:47,335
First something I already
very long time to do.

873
01:18:49,187 --> 01:18:52,138
Who wants to be trimmed?
- No.

874
01:18:52,181 --> 01:18:54,540
What do you do?
- You have to look good in your coffin.

875
01:18:54,554 --> 01:18:57,871
Do not do it, Cunth!

876
01:18:57,971 --> 01:19:00,139
Boys.

877
01:19:12,381 --> 01:19:16,155
No!

878
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:24,000
Look at me, I'm MacGruber.
I'm going to kick some Cunth.

879
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:26,494
Want to fight? Damn.

880
01:19:41,192 --> 01:19:43,491
Hey.

881
01:19:43,730 --> 01:19:46,475
What the hell?

882
01:19:55,835 --> 01:19:57,893
Now, Vicki.

883
01:20:06,253 --> 01:20:10,506
You do not use weapons?
- Right.

884
01:20:11,788 --> 01:20:15,290
You hit like a girl.
- And you go like a girl walking around.

885
01:20:15,291 --> 01:20:19,224
Because if I have dismantled the rocket,
I cut your dick off and push him ...

886
01:20:19,324 --> 01:20:21,060
in my mouth. Just one plate
to keep playing.

887
01:20:21,095 --> 01:20:26,018
The only record is your dick in your mouth.

888
01:20:31,921 --> 01:20:35,604
Launch in three minutes.
- Another three minutes.

889
01:20:35,748 --> 01:20:37,973
Go ahead.

890
01:20:45,472 --> 01:20:50,843
This situation, I have repeatedly
experienced and nothing ever happens really.

891
01:20:52,195 --> 01:20:54,906
Before we begin, I must tell you something.

892
01:20:54,940 --> 01:20:58,030
I've been thinking since so many
Yesterday we had sex ...

893
01:20:58,130 --> 01:21:00,186
The bomb.
- You're right.

894
01:21:00,197 --> 01:21:02,690
Piper, give me the wire.
- Does he, MacGruber.

895
01:21:02,790 --> 01:21:05,633
Vicki, the ball bearing.
- Please.

896
01:21:05,733 --> 01:21:08,734
Piper, who pincers.
- Come out.

897
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:13,059
Hurry.
- The time is almost up.

898
01:21:14,294 --> 01:21:18,900
Make me the happiest man ...
- Yes, yes.

899
01:21:19,074 --> 01:21:21,750
I'm Casey's spirit to overcome yesterday.
Here we talk about later.

900
01:21:21,784 --> 01:21:24,706
We have a nuclear missile ...
Damn.

901
01:21:24,806 --> 01:21:27,553
What's wrong?
- What the hell is this?

902
01:21:27,653 --> 01:21:30,089
A nuclear missile. This can
dismantle, right?

903
01:21:30,189 --> 01:21:34,614
Seriously, who built this?
Or one million wires.

904
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:39,574
I'm just an electrician.
Where is this going?

905
01:21:39,677 --> 01:21:42,466
This is a green.
But a lot.

906
01:21:42,566 --> 01:21:45,061
Launch in two minutes.
- Two minutes!

907
01:21:45,161 --> 01:21:48,496
I heard that!
Always saw.

908
01:21:48,682 --> 01:21:52,868
I am so sorry, sweetheart.
- Can you do this or not?

909
01:21:56,409 --> 01:22:00,745
No, I can not dismantle missiles.

910
01:22:01,339 --> 01:22:07,663
Bravo, MacGruber.
Again I win and you lose.

911
01:22:07,702 --> 01:22:10,232
My sentence was not finished.

912
01:22:10,332 --> 01:22:12,452
I can not dismantle missile ...

913
01:22:12,588 --> 01:22:17,408
but I can.
- Launch a minute.

914
01:22:19,782 --> 01:22:23,692
A nuclear missile is nothing without its heart.

915
01:22:23,727 --> 01:22:27,069
Damn.
It does not matter.

916
01:22:27,169 --> 01:22:31,736
It contains enough nitrate
to the White House and Congress to explode.

917
01:22:31,824 --> 01:22:35,338
Again correct. But he
flies hard ...

918
01:22:35,441 --> 01:22:38,357
without ...

919
01:22:39,866 --> 01:22:42,106
the guidance system.

920
01:22:42,467 --> 01:22:44,336
So you win anyway.

921
01:22:44,371 --> 01:22:47,338
And because you will documents
is blown ...

922
01:22:47,438 --> 01:22:50,424
how much longer, Mrs. MacGruber?
- 32 seconds.

923
01:22:50,435 --> 01:22:53,832
We will be better off.
We need to arrange a marriage.

924
01:22:54,347 --> 01:22:56,370
Forward.

925
01:23:03,574 --> 01:23:08,583
Bye.
- MacGruber.

926
01:23:15,811 --> 01:23:20,442
Ten, nine, eight, seven ...

927
01:23:20,784 --> 01:23:23,220
Six, five ...

928
01:23:23,255 --> 01:23:29,190
Four, three, two, one, zero.

929
01:23:39,981 --> 01:23:43,274
Classic MacGruber.

930
01:23:48,269 --> 01:23:50,739
I love you both.

931
01:23:57,860 --> 01:24:00,721
SIX MONTHS LATER

932
01:24:00,755 --> 01:24:04,086
There is love without borders.

933
01:24:04,087 --> 01:24:06,926
A love that heals in bad times.

934
01:24:07,079 --> 01:24:10,765
A love that forgives in bad times.

935
01:24:10,865 --> 01:24:15,185
A love that love each other,
in times of love.

936
01:24:15,285 --> 01:24:19,184
That said Vicki.
Beautiful, sweetie.

937
01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:27,368
Is there anyone present who
against this marriage?

938
01:24:35,761 --> 01:24:38,643
Let's start.

939
01:24:38,884 --> 01:24:44,518
You take Vicki St. Elmo, MacGruber,
as your faithful husband?

940
01:24:44,618 --> 01:24:48,161
Yes.

941
01:24:48,529 --> 01:24:54,906
And do you, MacGruber,
Vicki St. Elmo as your faithful wife?

942
01:25:02,314 --> 01:25:05,130
No!

943
01:25:11,522 --> 01:25:14,541
I'm fine.
It is good.

944
01:25:21,499 --> 01:25:23,657
Do not.

945
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:38,465
I must admit that I
glad to be alive.

946
01:25:38,676 --> 01:25:42,223
There is something I have
long wanted to speak.

947
01:25:42,377 --> 01:25:44,735
Cunth ...

948
01:25:44,753 --> 01:25:48,916
Pipe your dick.
- Come and get it.

949
01:25:52,988 --> 01:25:56,219
Where did he go?

950
01:25:56,220 --> 01:25:59,332
Exploded during the explosion.
- It kidding?

951
01:25:59,432 --> 01:26:04,643
Are we ready?
- No, we're not ready.

952
01:26:08,690 --> 01:26:10,707
Piper.

953
01:26:28,217 --> 01:26:30,779
Damn, dude!

954
01:26:53,055 --> 01:26:55,886
Yes, I will.
