1
00:00:12,292 --> 00:00:14,625
(shouting)

2
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:20,042
(gunshot)

3
00:00:20,042 --> 00:00:22,667
- Lord Jesus, I used to think.

4
00:00:22,667 --> 00:00:24,000
(shouting)

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,667
But Lord I realize that
violence is the artist,

6
00:00:25,667 --> 00:00:27,667
and I'm just aggression.

7
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:31,375
Lord to break the chain
you have to remove a link.

8
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:35,125
Lord, I set out to find
that link and remove it.

9
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:37,958
But Lord sometimes I don't
know if I have the will,

10
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,125
or if I'm so arrogant
to think that

11
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:41,083
I'm the archangel Gabriel.

12
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:45,375
(groaning)
(scuffling)

13
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:47,792
(rap music)

14
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:58,000
- [Voiceover] Let's move,
move it move it, let's go.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
- [Voiceover] Don't shoot,
don't shoot, come on!

16
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,750
- [Voiceover] Hey someone,
there's a dead cop.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,083
- [Voiceover] Get
him up, get him up!

18
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:21,000
- What do you mean
you can't give out any

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,875
information, I'm his son.

20
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:27,208
I just wanna know if my
father is okay, okay,

21
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:30,708
can you give me that
information please?

22
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:32,625
Yes, I'll hold.

23
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:33,625
- Sup, brah?

24
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:37,625
- Nothing man, I'm just trying
find to out if Pop's okay.

25
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:39,000
- From what I heard
he's one of the hardest

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,292
gangsters to ever step foot
on this unworthy planet, man.

27
00:01:42,292 --> 00:01:43,917
- James, stop it.

28
00:01:43,917 --> 00:01:46,208
- No, not that I would know,
because hasn't been around

29
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:47,167
since I was a kid.

30
00:01:47,167 --> 00:01:48,083
- James Jr.

31
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:50,958
Can you cool it, brah?

32
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,000
Yes I'm still here.

33
00:01:57,167 --> 00:01:58,208
Thank you.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,833
Thank you very much.

35
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:03,167
He's okay man, they're
just gonna transfer him

36
00:02:03,167 --> 00:02:05,417
to another facility.

37
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:07,417
- Another facility?

38
00:02:07,417 --> 00:02:09,875
Now why can't you
just say prison?

39
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:11,708
Because that's where
he is, he in prison!

40
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:13,208
Prison!

41
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:16,042
And he ain't never
getting out man, come on.

42
00:02:16,042 --> 00:02:17,167
- Look James, James, James--

43
00:02:17,167 --> 00:02:18,792
- I'm going to school man.

44
00:02:18,792 --> 00:02:22,917
- Hey listen to me, now you
know Pop loves you right?

45
00:02:22,917 --> 00:02:23,708
- Yeah...

46
00:02:25,042 --> 00:02:27,333
Yeah I know that, man.

47
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,458
All right man, I love you man!

48
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:30,375
- Get off of me fool.

49
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,042
- Kiss, what's wrong with you?

50
00:02:32,042 --> 00:02:34,583
- You know I don't
roll like that.

51
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:37,917
You just get your
behind to school man.

52
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,792
- [Voiceover] Some of these
prisoners to other facilities

53
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,625
in order to defuse tensions.

54
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:46,042
(rap music)

55
00:02:58,042 --> 00:02:59,875
- Stand the fuck up!

56
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:09,875
You know what
happened to me today?

57
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,500
Wife bought a couch.

58
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:14,625
$3,700.

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,292
We don't have
$3,700 in the bank,

60
00:03:20,292 --> 00:03:22,583
but with her being a
consistent dumb bitch,

61
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:27,000
she decides buying a $3,700
couch is more important

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,125
than paying the mortgage.

63
00:03:31,917 --> 00:03:35,125
Reason I'm sharing this
anecdote with you dumb fucks,

64
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:39,250
is to let you know, do
not fuck with me today.

65
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,000
Because I will take out $3,700
worth of anger on one of you

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,583
fuckers, and that's
a lot of asswhoopin'

67
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:47,125
and ain't none of y'all
motherfuckers worth a dime!

68
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,250
God gave you two ears
and only one mouth,

69
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:53,125
it means you should listen
twice as much as you speak.

70
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,583
So continue to shut the fuck
up and hear what I'm saying

71
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:58,583
and I might not
kill your ass today.

72
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:06,125
All of you motherfuckers is
a bunch of fucking idiots.

73
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:09,042
We know that because God
always sends the dumbass

74
00:04:09,042 --> 00:04:12,292
motherfuckers to me,
just like my dumbass

75
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,333
couch-buying wife.

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,750
James Animal Allen.

77
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,792
Welcome home, it's
been a long time.

78
00:04:25,792 --> 00:04:27,333
- Not long enough.

79
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,917
- Hmm-mm, 15 years you did here,

80
00:04:29,917 --> 00:04:33,125
you finally get out
and what happens?

81
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,917
Straight back in the
joint like every other

82
00:04:34,917 --> 00:04:37,292
dumb fuck that ever left here.

83
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,875
They transfer you from
Folsom, because you know

84
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,792
niggers and spics get
along, so I guess you're

85
00:04:41,792 --> 00:04:42,958
my problem now.

86
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:45,125
- I ain't nobody's problem, sir.

87
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,000
- Glad to hear it Animal,
but we don't want more

88
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,292
trouble like you had in Folsom.

89
00:04:48,292 --> 00:04:50,083
- I ain't start no riot.

90
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,833
- Tell it to the warden.

91
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,375
He's starting you off
with a week in the hole.

92
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,042
Send you a message.

93
00:04:56,042 --> 00:04:58,458
(rap music)

94
00:05:37,792 --> 00:05:40,708
(foreboding music)

95
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:19,708
- Whoo-ee.

96
00:06:22,292 --> 00:06:23,083
Damn.

97
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,167
That's official.

98
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:28,208
- Yep.

99
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,500
- Damn.

100
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,542
You gonna have to
hurry with that though.

101
00:06:33,542 --> 00:06:34,833
- You're greedy, you know that?

102
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:35,750
- Hell yes.

103
00:06:39,042 --> 00:06:40,000
- That's what I'm talking about.

104
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,667
- Alright, let's go.

105
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:42,542
- Go where?

106
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,125
- School, fool.

107
00:06:46,417 --> 00:06:47,042
- Nigga I'm trying to stay
here and finish the rest

108
00:06:47,042 --> 00:06:48,667
of this chronic.

109
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:50,625
- Dude you ain't been
to school all week.

110
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:54,583
- So why would I fuck my
week up on going today?

111
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:55,917
- Your mom ain't gonna trip?

112
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:57,000
- Man I gave her
like three joints,

113
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,708
she ain't coming out
of her room today.

114
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:01,375
- Word, aight man I'm out.

115
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,542
- Aight.

116
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:03,333
Yo!

117
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,750
- Yo!

118
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,750
- Coming to the park
after school today?

119
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,792
- Oh yeah for sure.

120
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:07,583
- Aight man.

121
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,000
- [James] Peace.

122
00:07:11,542 --> 00:07:12,333
- Damn.

123
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,292
Shit's crazy.

124
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:22,167
(car horn honking)

125
00:07:22,167 --> 00:07:23,958
- Eh!

126
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:27,333
You trying to give me
a heart attack, man?

127
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,708
- See I knew your little
ass was in too much

128
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,375
of a hurry to get to school.

129
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:35,917
- Man I ain't gonna be late,
don't you see me running?

130
00:07:35,917 --> 00:07:39,083
Why you ain't at
work yet anyway?

131
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,625
- Well I figured it was
Friday, call and tell

132
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,125
I'ma be a little bit late.

133
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,417
- Uh huh.

134
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:46,333
- Pick up a couple of
breakfast burritos.

135
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,625
Catch my little brother
on the way to school.

136
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:52,875
- Oh okay so, you got
breakfast burritos in the car?

137
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:55,750
- Yup.

138
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:02,000
- Sausage and eggs?

139
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,083
- Ain't that what you like?

140
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,083
- You gonna be late, man!

141
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:20,917
Damn.

142
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:25,083
- Damn man why you
eating that like that?

143
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,292
Y'all been up just
smoking weed huh?

144
00:08:27,292 --> 00:08:28,083
- Shit no.

145
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,917
Now why you tripping?

146
00:08:32,917 --> 00:08:35,083
- I don't know why you
hang with that fool anyway.

147
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,833
- Tommy's cool man.

148
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,250
He just need a little guidance.

149
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,208
- Guidance?

150
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,750
Now what you know
about guidance?

151
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,667
- As a brother I stayed
on your ass so long

152
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:46,000
you could barely breathe.

153
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,458
- That's right, I ain't
about to let up neither.

154
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,167
- These both mine?

155
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:55,208
(rap music)

156
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,000
Yep.

157
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:58,250
On time.

158
00:09:00,292 --> 00:09:03,250
- All right there
man, have a good day.

159
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,125
- Alright.

160
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,750
- [Darius] Alright.

161
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:10,542
- Let's go.

162
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,417
Rise and shine.

163
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:21,125
You ripe.

164
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,208
What you been doing
in there all week

165
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:27,083
while I was enjoying my freedom?

166
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:31,042
- Trying to figure out what
a $3,700 couch looks like.

167
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:41,583
- [Ellis] You and I both
been at this a long time.

168
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:44,000
We pretty much seen it
all, ain't that right?

169
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,208
- Pretty much.

170
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,042
- Nowadays,

171
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,875
it's like I never
seen so much hating.

172
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,417
I feel like this place's
about to go apeshit,

173
00:09:54,417 --> 00:09:55,625
you know what I'm saying.

174
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:58,083
- Man that's not my problem.

175
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,958
- It's gonna be everybody's
problem, Animal,

176
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,042
when shit hits the fan.

177
00:10:02,042 --> 00:10:03,875
But you got respect.

178
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,375
Don't forget that.

179
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:09,000
Get his supplies and
take him to his cell.

180
00:10:27,417 --> 00:10:30,042
- Get off of my bed.

181
00:10:30,042 --> 00:10:31,500
- The great Animal.

182
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:34,167
Man.

183
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:46,042
Hey man uh, don't
confuse the fact

184
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:48,000
that I let you have that
bed means that I'm a punk,

185
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,250
and that there's gonna be
some ass cracking in here,

186
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,750
'cause there ain't gonna
be no ass cracking.

187
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,083
Because I guarantee you,
if I get my ass cracked,

188
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,167
ain't nobody sleeping
around here, ever,

189
00:11:00,167 --> 00:11:01,083
not a wink.

190
00:11:03,042 --> 00:11:05,667
- Calm down son, I
ain't got no intention

191
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:07,458
of raping your little ass.

192
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,042
- Well that's good news.

193
00:11:10,042 --> 00:11:12,667
Hey uh, name's Lou by the way.

194
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,625
Hey I heard about
that riot you started

195
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:21,083
with them Mexicans man.

196
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,583
- [Animal] Ain't started
nothing with nobody.

197
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,792
- That's not what I heard,
I heard you cut up this

198
00:11:25,792 --> 00:11:30,042
Mexican dude and the whole
place went crazy, man.

199
00:11:30,042 --> 00:11:32,000
But that's your business.

200
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,125
I just thought you might
wanna know about Uno, is all.

201
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:38,125
Man he's this big
Mexican dude, man.

202
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,333
Leader of 'em all in fact.

203
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,125
- What about him?

204
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:46,875
- His cousin is the
dude you cut up.

205
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,500
I mean the dude
they say you cut up.

206
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,208
But that's none of my business.

207
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,958
So I guess you coming back
here is supposed to be

208
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,708
a big deal or something, right?

209
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,083
- Why is that?

210
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,458
- You know the fights,
you know the fights man.

211
00:11:58,458 --> 00:11:59,667
- What fights?

212
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,833
- You know the fights
between the two inmates man,

213
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:07,292
everybody bet on it,
everybody in on that man.

214
00:12:07,292 --> 00:12:08,708
- Captain Ellis?

215
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:11,083
- Nah, nah he old school
man, but Hollywood,

216
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,708
he all up in that.

217
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,042
- Hollywood?

218
00:12:14,042 --> 00:12:15,708
- Yeah, that's what
we call the warden,

219
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,417
on account that he always
going to movie auditions,

220
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:20,708
he wanna be some big
movie star or something.

221
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:23,667
Well Kasada, he give Hollywood
and the guards their cut

222
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:26,208
and nobody mess with 'em.

223
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,667
- So what that
got to do with me?

224
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:31,083
- They say back in the day
man, you used to be a bad ass

225
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,167
when it came to the fights
man, Kasada set 'em up

226
00:12:33,167 --> 00:12:36,750
and bam, you knocked
'em down man.

227
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,167
- Yeah well, more power to him.

228
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:42,708
I don't do that no more.

229
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,125
- That's crazy, man.

230
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:44,917
- What?

231
00:12:46,167 --> 00:12:50,583
- Because Kasada already
set up your first fight.

232
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,750
- Where do I find Kasada?

233
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:56,250
- Where you find any
pastor, at the church.

234
00:12:58,292 --> 00:13:00,708
(rap music)

235
00:13:08,417 --> 00:13:10,167
(frantic gasping)

236
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:14,167
- Degenerate motherfucker,
are you gonna pay, are you?

237
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:18,125
You owe the church $200 you
miserable piece of shit!

238
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:26,000
And the Bible says, to
give wholeheartedly,

239
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,375
you fucking prick!

240
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,833
Hey, I forgive you.

241
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,208
But I'm gonna send you out

242
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:42,000
amongst the wolves and
you will get me the money

243
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,417
that you owe the church,

244
00:13:43,417 --> 00:13:45,667
and I want it this afternoon,

245
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:46,875
a-fucking-men!

246
00:13:58,042 --> 00:13:59,417
Are you surprised?

247
00:14:01,917 --> 00:14:03,042
See, when the others were

248
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:06,458
studying to become
jailhouse lawyers,

249
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:10,083
I studied to become
a jailhouse pastor.

250
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:13,708
I read the good book,
took a couple of tests,

251
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:14,500
and voila,

252
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,000
I am the inmate pastor.

253
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:23,000
And membership has
its privileges.

254
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
- I guess you won't be
the first man to fuck up

255
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,500
in the name of God.

256
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,333
I'm not fighting.

257
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,292
- Now wait a minute.

258
00:14:32,292 --> 00:14:33,708
Don't turn down shit 'till

259
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,833
you heard the whole deal.

260
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:40,958
When I heard about
the riots over there,

261
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,042
I took a special
interest in you.

262
00:14:44,042 --> 00:14:46,000
Yeah, I pulled a few
strings with the help

263
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
of my friend the warden,
had you transferred here,

264
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,417
the whole thing.

265
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:56,792
And now, I need you to
run the niggers for me.

266
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:58,500
Because right now
they're not playing ball

267
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,625
with my dope game.

268
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:03,042
Ralo's running things
over there, and he says

269
00:15:03,042 --> 00:15:06,958
the brothers gotta buy
their dope from him.

270
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,208
Well that's 50% of my
business, and I want those

271
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:14,583
customers back so I need
you to take his ass out.

272
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:18,208
- And I assume you're gonna
tell me why I would do this.

273
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:21,167
- Well for the money of
course, you're gonna get

274
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:22,000
a decent cut.

275
00:15:23,542 --> 00:15:26,458
Decent enough to get both of
your boys out of the projects.

276
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,458
- Don't talk about my
family, I take care of 'em

277
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,167
you understand?

278
00:15:30,167 --> 00:15:32,375
- When was the last
time you saw James Jr.?

279
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:35,375
- I said don't talk
about my family!

280
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,167
- Alright.

281
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:43,292
But I want you to
think about this.

282
00:15:43,292 --> 00:15:45,708
- No need to think about it.

283
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,500
God forgive you.

284
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,333
- Have it your way.

285
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,750
(rap music)

286
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:06,375
I always preferred
plan B anyway, boys.

287
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,625
(gun fires)

288
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,750
(rap music)

289
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,958
- Damn, nigga.

290
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,875
This shit is fly,
when you get this?

291
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,417
- [Driver] The other day,
yo let me hit that bud.

292
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:24,167
- Damn hold on brother, I'm
gonna smoke the whole thing.

293
00:16:24,167 --> 00:16:25,833
- Yo, pass that shit.

294
00:16:27,792 --> 00:16:31,292
Yeah I done come up since I
started working for Twist.

295
00:16:31,292 --> 00:16:34,500
- I see that man,
when can I be down?

296
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,083
- On the real,
that's why I'm here.

297
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:40,042
- Oh for real, Twist want a
player like me on the team huh?

298
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:43,083
- Nah he asking about
your boy James Jr.

299
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:44,750
- Why?

300
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,958
- When that nigga asking to do
something, you don't ask why,

301
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,500
you just do it.

302
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,958
- Is it something bad?

303
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:50,750
- Nah.

304
00:16:52,042 --> 00:16:54,833
- I thought you say you
ain't know what he wanted.

305
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:58,750
- If it was something bad I
would've shot your ass already.

306
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,542
Hop in.

307
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:01,417
- Alright.

Yo let James sit in the front.

00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,208

335
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,083
- Nigga, get yo ass

336
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,750
I ain't playing with you.

337

- Why you G'd up, dog?

338
00:18:29,167 --> 00:18:30,833

James and I don't need you

339
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:33,167

Damn.

00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:46,833
- Haha, I remember you.

344
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:57,542
- Yo, the boss.

345
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:02,167
- Who?

346
00:19:02,167 --> 00:19:03,958
- Big Twist, man.

347
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,583
He's like a ghetto version
of the True Hollywood Story.

348
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:09,083
He used to be a small
time dope man right?

349
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,333
Then one day, he got
kidnapped and robbed.

350
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,542
I'm talking about they
stole all his shit.

351
00:19:13,542 --> 00:19:15,292
The niggas he owed, they
didn't give a fuck about him

352
00:19:15,292 --> 00:19:17,208
getting robbed, they
just wanted their cheese.

353
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:18,792
So they go looking for
this motherfucker right?

354
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:20,208

00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:34,542
will prosecute your son to
the full extent of the law.

534
00:28:34,542 --> 00:28:37,167
And he will end up in prison.

535
00:28:37,167 --> 00:28:39,833
And I will arrange for
a reception committee

536
00:28:39,833 --> 00:28:43,208
to fuck him up the ass so bad.

537
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:45,083
That his asshole will
look like a big chug

538
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:47,542
when they are through with him.

539
00:28:52,875 --> 00:28:57,167
Now, Mr. Dillen will do
exactly what I tell him to do,

540
00:28:57,167 --> 00:29:01,167
because two years ago, at
his office Christmas party,

541
00:29:01,167 --> 00:29:03,625
I arranged for an incredible
piece of ass to throw

542
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:08,208
herself at him, and Mr.
Dillen, in his inebriated state

543
00:29:08,208 --> 00:29:10,583
took her home and banged her.

544
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:13,667
Unfortunately for Mr. Dillen,
the young lady in question

545
00:29:13,667 --> 00:29:14,792
was underage.

546
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:20,000
So Mr. Dillen has been
beholden to me ever since,

547
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,083
if he doesn't do what
I tell him to do...

548
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:26,000
I'll turn his ass in.

549
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:30,208
And he will end up in prison,
and the big chug scenario

550
00:29:30,208 --> 00:29:31,833
will apply to him.

551
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:37,958
So.

552
00:29:37,958 --> 00:29:41,125
My only question to
you, Animal is this.

553
00:29:42,458 --> 00:29:46,208
Do you really have
anything to think about?

554
00:29:48,167 --> 00:29:51,542
That's all for now, you can go.

555
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:53,542
Thanks again for coming.

556
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:05,000
I sure as hell hope

557
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
that you can
control your people.

558
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,500
- I'll do what I have to do.

559
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,083
But in eight months,
we're through.

560
00:30:14,083 --> 00:30:14,875
Scumbag.

561
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,667
- Now is that any way to
talk to a pastor, you fuck?

562
00:30:21,667 --> 00:30:25,417
How'd you like me to have
you baptized, asshole?

563
00:30:25,417 --> 00:30:28,000
(hip hop music)

564
00:30:30,292 --> 00:30:33,292
(knock on the door)

565
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,667
- [Woman] Hey!

566
00:30:48,667 --> 00:30:51,083
I thought I wasn't gonna
see you until tomorrow.

567
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:52,542
- I have a little
surprise for you

568
00:30:52,542 --> 00:30:56,250
and I wanted to tell
you about it personally.

569
00:30:57,417 --> 00:30:58,792
Guess who's starting
her first day

570
00:30:58,792 --> 00:31:01,958
at the public defender's
office tomorrow?

571
00:31:01,958 --> 00:31:03,125
- What?

572
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:04,292
Really, me?

573
00:31:04,292 --> 00:31:06,000
Oh my God!

574
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,208
- [Dillen] I pulled
some strings.

575
00:31:07,208 --> 00:31:08,875
- So when do I start?

576
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:11,292
Oh, you said tomorrow.

577
00:31:11,292 --> 00:31:12,500
Okay, but Dillen,

578
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,042
no more favors.

579
00:31:14,042 --> 00:31:17,083
- I know, I know, you wanna
do it all on your own.

- Hi, I'm Kate Martinez.

587
00:31:57,042 --> 00:31:58,083
- Here you go.

588
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:58,875
- Thanks.

589
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,792
That's it?

590
00:32:04,708 --> 00:32:07,083
Is that my whole case load?

591
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:10,333
- It's the second
door on your left.

592
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:13,125
(mellow rap beat)

593
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:35,083
- You my brother's
public pretender?

594
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:36,083
- Public defender.

595
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:37,625
- Yeah, whatever man, look.

596
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:38,958
I know you guys
usually deal with

597
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:41,167
a bunch of scumbags
and everything, but

598
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,500
my brother's different, alright?

599
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,292
It was his best friend
that got shot and killed.

600
00:32:44,292 --> 00:32:46,000
Now I know you got
a huge case load,

601
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,458
you don't care nothing
about your clients,

602
00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:49,750
but check this out.

603
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,000
That's his report card, alright?

604
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,583
All A's and one B plus.

605
00:32:52,583 --> 00:32:55,375
He's not that kind of kid.

606
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:56,708
- I'm reviewing
the case right now.

607
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:57,667
Why don't you just
give me a few--

608
00:32:57,667 --> 00:32:59,542
- Yeah right, look, look.

609
00:32:59,542 --> 00:33:02,167
I would have hired a
real lawyer, alright?

610
00:33:02,167 --> 00:33:03,917
But I had to spend
my money on bail.

611
00:33:03,917 --> 00:33:06,167
I know you got 100 other
cases and everything, but

612
00:33:06,167 --> 00:33:07,250
yo, look.

613
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,833
He's innocent, alright?

614
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:10,167
That's my brother, this one
right here is different.

615
00:33:10,167 --> 00:33:12,167
- As a matter of fact, I
happen to be a real lawyer.

616
00:33:12,167 --> 00:33:14,292
And this is my only case,
so you don't have to worry.

617
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:16,167
- Wait, wait, hold up.

618
00:33:16,167 --> 00:33:19,333
What do you mean this
is your only case?

619
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:20,125
- It's my first day.

620
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:21,417
- Your first day?

621
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:22,167
Man, get the fuck
outta here, what the

622
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:23,000
hell is going on?

623
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,042
Bullshit!

624
00:33:26,292 --> 00:33:28,708
(rap music)

625
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:41,875
- Hey!

626
00:33:42,792 --> 00:33:44,167
Got a new transfer in here.

627
00:33:44,167 --> 00:33:46,333
Let's get him set up.

628
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:47,958
- Hello.

629
00:33:47,958 --> 00:33:48,792
- Scarface.

630
00:33:48,792 --> 00:33:49,792
- Po Po Lou.

631
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,375
- [Lou] They don't call
me that no more, man.

632
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:55,500
- Why, you ain't shit
your pants no more?

633
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,833
- It was only the one time.

634
00:33:56,833 --> 00:33:58,458
And I told y'all.

635
00:33:58,458 --> 00:33:59,750
That was chili.

636
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,083
I was still hungry,
I was trying to

637
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:02,333
smuggle some food
back to my cell.

638
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:03,833
- Back in yo ass, nigga?

639
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,333
- That's how they
get the drugs in!

640
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:07,333
- No nigga, that was
your first night in jail.

641
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:09,083
And yo ass was just
a little too nervous,

642
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:11,792
that's the fucking
problem right there, boy.

643
00:34:11,792 --> 00:34:13,917
- Man, do you need
anything else?

644
00:34:13,917 --> 00:34:15,125
- Nigga, I'm just
fucking with you man,

645
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:16,083
it's all good.

646
00:34:17,542 --> 00:34:19,625
Yo, I heard that Animal's
the top shot caller

647
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:21,375
in this motherfucker right here.

648
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:23,167
Yo man, I did time
with that nigga

649
00:34:23,167 --> 00:34:24,417
back in Folsom during the riots,

650
00:34:24,417 --> 00:34:25,875
that shit was crazy, man.

651
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:27,417
They had niggas
transferred out right away

652
00:34:27,417 --> 00:34:29,000
in this shit, man.

653
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,167
- Animal's the hardest,
coldest gangsta I know.

654
00:34:31,167 --> 00:34:32,583
Old school.

655
00:34:32,583 --> 00:34:34,417
They don't make them
like that no more.

656
00:34:34,417 --> 00:34:36,083
- What, you like,
his biggest fan now?

657
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:37,375
- No, no.

658
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,625
I'm just saying, I
ain't never see a G

659
00:34:38,625 --> 00:34:40,208
do it like that
before, that's all.

660
00:34:40,208 --> 00:34:41,792
- [Scarface] I do my thing, too.

661
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:44,125
- Yeah, but not like that.

662
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:46,000
- I get the job done man,
he ain't the only nigga

663
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,125
putting in work.

664
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:47,917
- Maybe.

665
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,458
- The fuck you
mean maybe, nigga?

666
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:52,750
- Look man.

667
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,000
Never mind, it's
all good, alright?

668
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,042
- Let me tell you
something, I'm sick of

669
00:34:55,042 --> 00:34:56,542
motherfuckers taking
credit for my work

670
00:34:56,542 --> 00:34:58,500
and let me tell you
something else, nigga.

671
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,792
Nigga!

672
00:34:59,792 --> 00:35:02,000
I'm the one who
started that riot.

673
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,292
Yeah, that's right.

674
00:35:03,292 --> 00:35:04,667
One of Kasada's
boys came up to me

675
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:06,125
and offered me cheese
to do a hit on a nigga.

676
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:07,708
- [Lou] Kasada?

677
00:35:07,708 --> 00:35:09,250
- Yeah Kasada, he got
people everywhere, nigga.

678
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:11,042
Shit, I ain't even
know this dude.

679
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:12,083
Stuck him right in his face,

680
00:35:12,083 --> 00:35:13,708
I ain't got nothing
personal against him,

681
00:35:13,708 --> 00:35:15,708
but I gotta make that paper,
you feel what I'm saying?

682
00:35:15,708 --> 00:35:17,042
I ain't even know it
was Hulu's cousin,

683
00:35:17,042 --> 00:35:18,750
and that's what
started the riot.

684
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,042
So next time you
wanna pull your pump,

685
00:35:20,042 --> 00:35:21,167
know what I'm saying,
make sure you holler out

686
00:35:21,167 --> 00:35:22,958
for this nigga right here, son.

687
00:35:22,958 --> 00:35:24,125
You heard me?

688
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:27,042
- [Ellis] Walk it in
Walters, let's go.

689
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:30,417
Pastor of the Cherry
Point will bless you.

690
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,917
(rap music)

691
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,333
- [Darius] You see
this, you see this?

692
00:35:49,333 --> 00:35:50,917
This is exactly what
I was talking about!

693
00:35:50,917 --> 00:35:53,083
You hang out with fucking
thugs man, you get caught up.

694
00:35:53,083 --> 00:35:55,583
Get your ass in the goddamn car!

695
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:59,000
The fuck was you
thinking James, huh?

696
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,083
Answer me, boy!

697
00:36:05,042 --> 00:36:06,083
- Tommy's dead.

698
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,208
- Look man, what happened
to Tommy was horrible, okay?

699
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:17,875
Tell me everything
that happened.

700
00:36:22,917 --> 00:36:25,000
- I didn't do it.

701
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
You know?

702
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,083
I didn't do it.

703
00:36:36,125 --> 00:36:39,125
- Hey man, some dude was
found dead behind the church.

704
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:40,083
- Scarface?

705
00:36:40,083 --> 00:36:41,917
- How you know that?

706
00:36:46,958 --> 00:36:49,125
(rap music)

707
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:51,125
(grunting)

708
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,167
- Animal.

709
00:36:52,167 --> 00:36:53,958
I need to talk to you.

710
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:05,167
- [Kate] Now you're sure that's
everything you can remember?

711
00:37:05,167 --> 00:37:06,208
- [James] Yeah.

712
00:37:06,208 --> 00:37:08,208
- [Kate] You never
saw the weapon?

713
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:09,500
- I told you, no!

714
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,292
All I heard was a gunshot
and Tommy was dead.

715
00:37:11,292 --> 00:37:12,500
- Eh, James.

716
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,208
Calm down man, alright?

717
00:37:14,208 --> 00:37:16,167
I know it's hard,
just be cool alright?

718
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:18,417
Just answer the
questions, alright?

719
00:37:18,417 --> 00:37:21,083
- It's alright,
I'm on your side.

720
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:24,708
Darius, you're his
step brother, correct?

721
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:26,208
- [Darius] Correct.

722
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:30,083
- And your mom, Ms.
Allen, where is she?

723
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:31,917
- She passed away.

724
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:33,083
- Oh, I'm sorry.

725
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:35,583
What happened?

726
00:37:37,208 --> 00:37:39,083
- Hey look, do we have to
talk about this right now?

727
00:37:39,083 --> 00:37:44,000
- It's gonna come up in
court, we should be prepared.

728
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,625
- She died of a drug overdose.

729
00:37:48,042 --> 00:37:49,750
- And Mr. Allen?

730
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,000
- He's in prison.

731
00:37:55,583 --> 00:37:57,208
- Wait, don't to that!

732
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:58,000
- Do what?

733
00:37:59,208 --> 00:38:00,208
- Look just 'cause our
father's in prison,

734
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:02,167
you assume that this
is a lost cause.

735
00:38:02,167 --> 00:38:03,458
- No, I don't.

736
00:38:03,458 --> 00:38:05,167
But yes, the jury might.

737
00:38:05,167 --> 00:38:09,000
- Isn't it your job to make
them see it the right way?

738
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,125
(metallic slam)

739
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:13,708
(ominous music)

740
00:38:17,417 --> 00:38:18,708
- [Animal] Hey, son.

741
00:38:18,708 --> 00:38:20,042
- [Darius] Pop.

742
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:36,417
- There's some people
in here trying to

743
00:38:36,417 --> 00:38:40,000
make me do things by
framing your brother.

744
00:38:41,042 --> 00:38:41,833
- Why?

745
00:38:42,875 --> 00:38:45,125
- It don't matter.

746
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:48,292
You just need to keep
your brother safe.

747
00:38:49,917 --> 00:38:51,458
- I'll get a second job.

748
00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:52,625
And a real lawyer that's gonna--

749
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:53,417
- Listen.

750
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:55,125
Listen Darius.

751
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:57,333
Just leave it alone.

752
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:58,750
If I do what they
want, it'll be over

753
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,042
in a couple of months,
and if I don't,

754
00:39:00,042 --> 00:39:03,917
they'll continue
to frame James Jr.

755
00:39:03,917 --> 00:39:06,042
- There's gotta be
something I can do.

756
00:39:06,042 --> 00:39:09,333
- No, there's
nothing you can do.

757
00:39:09,333 --> 00:39:13,542
This thing goes way up the
ladder, to some very...

758
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:21,167
To some very important
people who will

759
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:24,000
do anything to stay on top.

760
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,875
- Pop, this is my fault
man, this is all my fault.

761
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:28,792
- Why do you say that?

762
00:39:28,792 --> 00:39:31,917
- You're in here man, because
you took the blame for me.

763
00:39:31,917 --> 00:39:33,750
- Darius, just stop.

764
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,042
Stop it.

765
00:39:35,042 --> 00:39:37,792
- I got into an
argument with you.

766
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,458
And I shot you.

767
00:39:40,458 --> 00:39:42,000
I shot you and
left you with a gun

768
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,958
I knew had murders on it.

769
00:39:43,958 --> 00:39:45,833
And you get charged
with those murders.

770
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:47,708
- Stop it Darius.

771
00:39:47,708 --> 00:39:49,125
Someone might hear you, stop it.

772
00:39:49,125 --> 00:39:52,125
- I don't care if
somebody hear me, Pop.

773
00:39:52,125 --> 00:39:53,333
I should have never
let you talk me into

774
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:55,042
leaving that scene.

775
00:39:55,042 --> 00:39:56,083
- It's okay.

776
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:57,375
- Why Pop, huh?

777
00:39:58,250 --> 00:39:59,458
Why is it okay for you to spend

778
00:39:59,458 --> 00:40:01,667
the rest of your life in jail

779
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:03,667
for a crime I committed?

780
00:40:05,125 --> 00:40:07,750
You got a son out there
man, that needs you.

781
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,750
- You needed me, Darius.

782
00:40:11,458 --> 00:40:12,792
I wasn't there.

783
00:40:13,958 --> 00:40:15,125
What about that?

784
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:19,333
I let you watch me do things

785
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:22,375
a son should never
see his father do.

786
00:40:22,375 --> 00:40:25,750
And I remember what I said,
just like it was yesterday.

787
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:28,667
I said, "Now you
can kill a nigga."

788
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:34,292
See son, I didn't have
any love for myself,

789
00:40:34,292 --> 00:40:35,833
and I didn't have
any love for anyone

790
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:39,583
who looked like me,
black, brown, yellow, red.

791
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:46,292
Now I don't wanna make the
same mistake with James Jr.

792
00:40:46,292 --> 00:40:47,083
So please.

793
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,583
Let me do this, son.

794
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,750
I don't want our next
generation growing up in prison.

795
00:40:56,750 --> 00:41:00,208
Let it stop right here,
right now, with me.

796
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:05,042
- Bet.

797
00:41:06,042 --> 00:41:07,083
Okay.

798
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:11,792
So what are you gonna do?

799
00:41:13,167 --> 00:41:15,292
- Exactly what they want.

800
00:41:16,625 --> 00:41:19,208
(metallic slam)

801
00:41:50,833 --> 00:41:53,333
- You know who you're fighting?

802
00:41:58,333 --> 00:42:01,500
That's Raulo, current
leader of the Darkies.

803
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,958
I don't want him
walking out of here.

804
00:42:03,958 --> 00:42:05,333
You understand me?

805
00:42:09,125 --> 00:42:12,167
- Son, if you don't wanna die,

806
00:42:12,167 --> 00:42:14,375
you should just walk away.

807
00:42:14,375 --> 00:42:16,167
- Walk away?

808
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:17,458
I'ma fuck you up.

809
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:22,125
(energetic music)

810
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:26,000
(thuds and grunts)

811
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,625
(sharp crack)

812
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:29,958
(grunting)

813
00:42:34,083 --> 00:42:36,375
(sharp crack)

814
00:42:36,375 --> 00:42:37,625
Come on, man!

815
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:38,583
Motherfucker, what you got?

816
00:42:38,583 --> 00:42:40,417
What you got?

817
00:42:40,417 --> 00:42:42,458
(sharp thud)

818
00:42:42,458 --> 00:42:44,792
(grunting)

819
00:42:48,125 --> 00:42:51,333
(sharp crack)

820
00:42:51,333 --> 00:42:53,958
(sharp crack)

821
00:42:58,792 --> 00:43:01,375
(metallic bang)

822
00:43:04,958 --> 00:43:07,625
(painful grunts)

823
00:43:12,167 --> 00:43:15,292
(desperate grunting)

824
00:43:50,208 --> 00:43:53,208
(guttural shouting)

825
00:44:11,167 --> 00:44:14,917
- I've been calling, you guys
never made your appointment.

826
00:44:14,917 --> 00:44:16,375
- [Darius] Oh yeah?

827
00:44:19,042 --> 00:44:20,167
- Listen, I have
some news that can

828
00:44:20,167 --> 00:44:21,833
prove James is innocent.

829
00:44:21,833 --> 00:44:24,625
- Oh yeah, that's cool,
you should get on that.

830
00:44:24,625 --> 00:44:27,167
- Darius, we found a witness.

831
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:31,750
- What?

832
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:33,167
- Across the street.

833
00:44:33,167 --> 00:44:34,833
From where the
murder took place.

834
00:44:34,833 --> 00:44:35,792
There's a bank
where a witness was

835
00:44:35,792 --> 00:44:38,083
taking money out of the ATM.

836
00:44:38,083 --> 00:44:39,167
And he heard the gunshot.

837
00:44:39,167 --> 00:44:40,833
- Did he see what happened?

838
00:44:40,833 --> 00:44:42,583
- No, he ran for cover as
soon as he heard the shot.

839
00:44:42,583 --> 00:44:43,750
- So he ain't see shit?

840
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:45,167
- No, he didn't.

841
00:44:46,125 --> 00:44:48,042
But the ATM camera did.

842
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,958
Did you hear me,
isn't this great?

843
00:44:50,958 --> 00:44:53,500
- Listen, you need
to forget about it.

844
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,125
- What?

845
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:57,917
- Look my father, he has
everything under control.

846
00:44:57,917 --> 00:45:00,083
- Your father is incarcerated!

847
00:45:00,083 --> 00:45:02,000
- That's what this is about.

848
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,917
- Darius, you have to trust me.

849
00:45:03,917 --> 00:45:05,083
- Trust you?

850
00:45:05,083 --> 00:45:06,125
Trust you?

851
00:45:06,958 --> 00:45:09,333
Lady, I don't even know you.

852
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:10,250
Alright listen, you bring your

853
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:12,042
high-society ass down here,

854
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,625
to talk about some crusade

855
00:45:13,625 --> 00:45:16,167
that you can talk about
at your next dinner party.

856
00:45:16,167 --> 00:45:17,417
But see, while you're up there

857
00:45:17,417 --> 00:45:19,125
passing around the
Grey Poupon and shit,

858
00:45:19,125 --> 00:45:22,083
we down here doing
the real crusade.

859
00:45:22,083 --> 00:45:25,375
So give me a fucking break on
that trust me shit, alright?

860
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:28,583
- I'm gonna subpoena that video.

861
00:45:28,583 --> 00:45:30,083
- Yeah you do that!

862
00:45:33,208 --> 00:45:35,500
(metallic slam)

863
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,667
- This shit's fucked up but we

864
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:39,167
still got a operation
to run here.

865
00:45:39,167 --> 00:45:42,167
Now that Raulo's gone, we
need to make some changes.

866
00:45:42,167 --> 00:45:43,958
We need to vote on a new leader.

867
00:45:43,958 --> 00:45:46,958
- [Animal] What
y'all talking about?

868
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:55,208
- Like I was saying before.

869
00:45:55,208 --> 00:45:56,500
We gotta stay strong
and let them know

870
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,458
that just because Raulo's gone,

871
00:45:58,458 --> 00:46:02,000
we still ain't nothing
to be fucked with.

872
00:46:07,083 --> 00:46:09,875
- So who's gonna be the leader?

873
00:46:09,875 --> 00:46:11,083
- Well shit, nigga.

874
00:46:11,083 --> 00:46:13,000
We 'bout to vote on it.

875
00:46:15,125 --> 00:46:16,250
- That right?

876
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:20,458
I think you wanna be the leader.

877
00:46:21,333 --> 00:46:23,208
- Why you say that?

878
00:46:23,208 --> 00:46:26,125
- You the one doing
all the talking.

879
00:46:26,125 --> 00:46:28,625
Giving the motherfucking
General Patton speech

880
00:46:28,625 --> 00:46:32,375
trying to rally the
troops and shit.

881
00:46:32,375 --> 00:46:34,000
Nah, nigga.

882
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,167
Ain't gonna be no vote.

883
00:46:37,208 --> 00:46:38,375
I'm your leader.

884
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
- This is bullshit, nigga.

885
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,208
What makes you our leader?

886
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:01,167
- I'm stupid.

887
00:47:01,167 --> 00:47:02,167
Ain't that right, Lou?

888
00:47:02,167 --> 00:47:05,042
- You're the stupidest
nigga I know, man.

889
00:47:05,042 --> 00:47:07,875
- Now Im'a give y'all my resume.

890
00:47:10,542 --> 00:47:11,833
Name is Animal.

891
00:47:14,042 --> 00:47:17,542
Now for those of
y'all who new here,

892
00:47:17,542 --> 00:47:19,583
just ask the man to your left

893
00:47:19,583 --> 00:47:21,833
or to your right.

894
00:47:21,833 --> 00:47:25,333
I guarantee you you one
degree of separation

895
00:47:25,333 --> 00:47:29,542
from knowing about all the
work I done put in here.

896
00:47:30,458 --> 00:47:34,000
Now if you have doubts, well...

897
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,958
I suggest you do some research.

898
00:47:36,958 --> 00:47:40,792
And if you still have
doubts in the air,

899
00:47:40,792 --> 00:47:43,167
then I invite you to
come visit me in my cell

900
00:47:43,167 --> 00:47:46,500
and maybe I can
convince you otherwise.

901
00:48:00,833 --> 00:48:03,167
- You ever heard some
shit like that before?

902
00:48:03,167 --> 00:48:05,458
- I never even seen
something like that before.

903
00:48:05,458 --> 00:48:08,667
But if I were you,
I wouldn't go, man.

904
00:48:14,208 --> 00:48:15,708
Hey yo, Animal.

905
00:48:15,708 --> 00:48:17,375
They say you top dog.

906
00:48:20,292 --> 00:48:21,083

- Man, what you talking about?

941
00:49:46,833 --> 00:49:49,042
- Come on, Animal.

942
00:49:49,042 --> 00:49:52,292
What are you doing this
for, is it for the money?

943
00:49:52,292 --> 00:49:55,042
- I said, I don't know
what you're talking about.

944
00:49:55,042 --> 00:49:57,667
- This ain't a game.

945
00:49:57,667 --> 00:49:59,208
So my advice to you
is, don't get caught up

946
00:49:59,208 --> 00:50:02,333
in this shit storm
without an umbrella.

947
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:04,042
- When a storm comes,
you can't always

948
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:05,833
trust the weather man.

949
00:50:09,208 --> 00:50:10,000
- Alright.

950
00:50:18,625 --> 00:50:20,000
- [Voiceover] Just chill out!

951
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,042
What's your problem?

952
00:50:21,042 --> 00:50:22,958
- [Ellis] Keep it down.

953
00:50:25,417 --> 00:50:28,042
(phone rings)

954
00:50:28,042 --> 00:50:29,083
- Hello?

955
00:50:29,083 --> 00:50:31,625
- Kate, this is Darius Allen.

956
00:50:33,417 --> 00:50:34,208
- Darius?

957
00:50:35,667 --> 00:50:37,167
Is everything okay?

958
00:50:39,542 --> 00:50:43,792
- Look, I'm sitting here
and I've decided that, um.

959
00:50:43,792 --> 00:50:45,292
Listen, we have that whole

960
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,750
attorney, client
thing with you, right?

961
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:49,000
- Yes, of course.

962
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,917
You can tell me
anything, I can help.

963
00:50:51,917 --> 00:50:54,125
- Alright, look.

964
00:50:54,125 --> 00:50:55,083
My brother was set up.

965
00:50:55,083 --> 00:50:58,208
(metallic slam)

966
00:50:58,208 --> 00:51:01,042
(ominous music)

967
00:51:04,042 --> 00:51:05,000
- Hey Pop.

968
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,250
- What's up, son?

969
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:10,125
Who this?

970
00:51:11,333 --> 00:51:12,625
- This is Junior's attorney,

971
00:51:12,625 --> 00:51:14,208
Kate Martinez.

972
00:51:14,208 --> 00:51:17,583
- Kate, this is my
father, James Allen Sr.

973
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,375
I had to tell her, Pop.

974
00:51:22,083 --> 00:51:24,042
- Tell her what?

975
00:51:24,042 --> 00:51:25,667
- About the setup.

976
00:51:28,292 --> 00:51:30,125
- Darius.

977
00:51:30,125 --> 00:51:32,708
(ominous music)

978
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,042
- Champ, do me a favor.

979
00:51:36,042 --> 00:51:37,542
Pull out that log sheet of yours

980
00:51:37,542 --> 00:51:40,833
and tell me who's
meeting with James Allen.

981
00:51:43,208 --> 00:51:44,750
- His son, Darius Allen.

982
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:47,292
And his other son, James
Allen Junior's lawyer.

983
00:51:47,292 --> 00:51:49,042
Kid's up on a murder wrap.

984
00:51:49,042 --> 00:51:50,667
Like father, like son, huh?

985
00:51:50,667 --> 00:51:51,458
Mm hmm.

986
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:53,458
- Apparently.

987
00:51:55,083 --> 00:51:58,667
- There's a video that
proves your son is innocent.

988
00:51:58,667 --> 00:51:59,792
An ATM video.

989
00:52:01,208 --> 00:52:02,792
- Where's the video?

990
00:52:04,292 --> 00:52:08,042
- Well we're getting
it from the bank today.

991
00:52:09,083 --> 00:52:10,333
See, I know there
are things that

992
00:52:10,333 --> 00:52:13,125
you can tell me
about what happened.

993
00:52:13,125 --> 00:52:16,750
And if I'm gonna help James,
you have to tell me everything.

994
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:18,417
- When you have that video,

995
00:52:18,417 --> 00:52:22,625
and you're sure it proves
James Jr.'s innocent,

996
00:52:22,625 --> 00:52:24,625
we'll take it from there.

997
00:52:24,625 --> 00:52:25,750
- That's fair enough.

998
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:27,833
I'll deal with you later.

999
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:35,500
- What do you mean
I won't cut you?

1000
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,000
Oh, I'll cut you.

1001
00:52:38,875 --> 00:52:39,958
I'll cut you.

1002
00:52:41,292 --> 00:52:44,000
I'll cut you real good.

1003
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
What do you?

1004
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,500
What do you mean
I won't cut you?

1005
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,167
(clears throat)

1006
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:50,083
Son of a bitch!

1007
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:52,125
You ever heard of knocking?

1008
00:52:52,125 --> 00:52:54,167
- [Ellis] Sorry sir,
but we need to talk.

1009
00:52:54,167 --> 00:52:56,042
- [Hollywood] Give me a minute.

1010
00:52:56,042 --> 00:52:58,667
- I'm afraid this needs to
be dealt with right away.

1011
00:52:58,667 --> 00:53:00,000
These fights that
Kasada's putting on

1012
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,708
is causing a lot of tension

1013
00:53:01,708 --> 00:53:03,208
within the population,
specifically between

1014
00:53:03,208 --> 00:53:05,125
the blacks and the Mexicans.

1015
00:53:05,125 --> 00:53:08,542
Now I know you think
this is harmless, sir.

1016
00:53:08,542 --> 00:53:10,792
But I respectfully disagree.

1017
00:53:10,792 --> 00:53:12,042
I think this place is
getting ready to blow

1018
00:53:12,042 --> 00:53:14,167
and it's not gonna be
pretty when it does.

1019
00:53:14,167 --> 00:53:16,458
We need to shut this thing down.

1020
00:53:16,458 --> 00:53:18,083
- Look.

1021
00:53:18,083 --> 00:53:20,125
The prisoners just need to
blow off a little steam.

1022
00:53:20,125 --> 00:53:21,542
It's no big deal.

1023
00:53:21,542 --> 00:53:22,833
- It's gonna be a
big deal, sir, if it

1024
00:53:22,833 --> 00:53:24,833
turns into a serious riot.

1025
00:53:24,833 --> 00:53:27,208
Have you ever seen
a serious riot, sir?

1026
00:53:27,208 --> 00:53:29,042
- Don't you patronize me.

1027
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:32,292
This is my prison.

1028
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:34,042
I'll run it my way.

1029
00:53:35,208 --> 00:53:38,000
Now get the fuck
out of my office.

1030
00:53:48,917 --> 00:53:50,417
- Counselor.

1031
00:53:50,417 --> 00:53:52,833
What is it I can do for you?

1032
00:53:52,833 --> 00:53:54,458
- We got a problem.

1033
00:53:54,458 --> 00:53:58,250
An ATM video proves
Animal's kid didn't do it.

1034
00:53:59,458 --> 00:54:02,542
- Well that's very interesting.

1035
00:54:02,542 --> 00:54:04,833
What do you intend
to do about it?

1036
00:54:04,833 --> 00:54:06,250
- There's nothing to do.

1037
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:07,500
It's over.

1038
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:08,625
- You know, you
Ivy League boys are

1039
00:54:08,625 --> 00:54:11,417
supposed to be so fucking smart.

1040
00:54:11,417 --> 00:54:14,125
But you're really
fucking stupid.

1041
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:18,458
It is not over, until it's done.

1042
00:54:18,458 --> 00:54:19,542
Now you said,

1043
00:54:19,542 --> 00:54:21,125
that you were gonna use people

1044
00:54:21,125 --> 00:54:23,417
that you could control.

1045
00:54:23,417 --> 00:54:25,792
Now if you've got a
person that you're using,

1046
00:54:25,792 --> 00:54:28,833
that is getting in the
way of your control,

1047
00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:31,000
you have a decision to make.

1048
00:54:32,125 --> 00:54:34,375
Who's more important?

1049
00:54:34,375 --> 00:54:35,875
You?

1050
00:54:35,875 --> 00:54:36,667
Or them?

1051
00:54:40,125 --> 00:54:40,917
- Shit!

1052
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:53,125
- I am telling you that
nobody from my office

1053
00:54:53,125 --> 00:54:54,208
picked it up.

1054
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:58,083
But they weren't from my office!

1055
00:54:58,083 --> 00:55:01,250
Why would the bank
give them the video?

1056
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:05,375
But I have the subpoena,
how could they have one?

1057
00:55:08,083 --> 00:55:11,500
How long will it take
to get another one?

1058
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,375
Three days?

1059
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,500
Okay, please just do it.

1060
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,292
Thanks.

1061
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:22,667
(rap music)

1062
00:55:41,542 --> 00:55:42,833
- I got you.

1063
00:55:42,833 --> 00:55:44,208
- Get out the fucking car!

1064
00:55:44,208 --> 00:55:47,833
Get out the, don't move
motherfucker, don't move!

1065
00:55:47,833 --> 00:55:49,375
Motherfucker, I
need to talk to you.

1066
00:55:49,375 --> 00:55:50,417
- I'm busy, dog.

1067
00:55:50,417 --> 00:55:51,917
- You busy?

1068
00:55:51,917 --> 00:55:54,417
You 'bout to motherfucking
be busy bleeding!

1069
00:55:54,417 --> 00:55:55,542
Oh, it's funny?

1070
00:55:55,542 --> 00:55:56,875
Shit is funny?

1071
00:55:56,875 --> 00:55:59,125
Y'all fuckers killed
Tommy and set me up?

1072
00:55:59,125 --> 00:55:59,917
- Hey man, y'all--

1073
00:55:59,917 --> 00:56:01,167
- The fuck, man?

1074
00:56:01,167 --> 00:56:01,958
Shut up!

1075
00:56:06,958 --> 00:56:08,042
- Man.

1076
00:56:08,042 --> 00:56:08,833
- [James] Punk ass.

1077
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:10,125
- Yeah?

1078
00:56:10,125 --> 00:56:11,917
You don't know who you
fucking with, bitch.

1079
00:56:11,917 --> 00:56:14,042
- Your punk ass better
bring me to Twist.

1080
00:56:14,042 --> 00:56:15,125
- Man, you don't know who--

1081
00:56:15,125 --> 00:56:16,542
- I said shut the fuck up!

1082
00:56:16,542 --> 00:56:18,083
Bring my ass to Twist!

1083
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:20,000
'Cause I could do this
shit all day, man!

1084
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,250
But I can see your nose
is starting to look

1085
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:23,125
like a fucking bloody ham hock.

1086
00:56:23,125 --> 00:56:25,208
What it's gonna be?

1087
00:56:25,208 --> 00:56:27,417
- Alright, alright, but it's
your motherfucking funeral.

1088
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:28,667
- [James] Say some shit!

1089
00:56:28,667 --> 00:56:31,083
(rap music)

1090
00:56:39,583 --> 00:56:41,042
- Somebody here to see you.

1091
00:56:41,042 --> 00:56:42,458
(high-pitched screaming)

1092
00:56:42,458 --> 00:56:44,458
- Tell them to put
down the guns, man.

1093
00:56:44,458 --> 00:56:47,042
- What can I do for
you, young blood?

1094
00:56:47,042 --> 00:56:49,042
- You killed Tommy, man.

1095
00:56:50,125 --> 00:56:51,542
- What makes you think that?

1096
00:56:51,542 --> 00:56:52,458
(gunshot)

1097
00:56:52,458 --> 00:56:54,000
- I ain't playing with you!

1098
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,917
- Woah, youngster.

1099
00:56:55,917 --> 00:56:58,500
- I ain't fucking
playing with you!

1100
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,500
- You need to be
smart right now.

1101
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:04,167
The fuck you think gonna
happen you pull that trigger?

1102
00:57:04,167 --> 00:57:06,792
You don't think my boys
here gonna kill you?

1103
00:57:06,792 --> 00:57:08,333
And what about your brother?

1104
00:57:08,333 --> 00:57:11,167
- Hey, don't say shit
about my brother, man!

1105
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:13,000
- Your brother.

1106
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,875
You acting real protective like

1107
00:57:14,875 --> 00:57:17,667
over the man shot
your own father.

1108
00:57:19,125 --> 00:57:20,250
Oh, my bad.

1109
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:23,375
You ain't even know
that shit, huh?

1110
00:57:23,375 --> 00:57:25,208
See, I was there

1111
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:29,167
when OGs like your father
paved these streets.

1112
00:57:29,167 --> 00:57:30,250
And yeah, I was
just a little nigga

1113
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:31,708
tagging along behind him, but

1114
00:57:31,708 --> 00:57:33,167
I made sure to carve
my name into the

1115
00:57:33,167 --> 00:57:36,417
wet pavement before
it dried, you dig?

1116
00:57:36,417 --> 00:57:39,000
So even though over time,
people forget things

1117
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,375
and shit gets changed,

1118
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,708
certain things,

1119
00:57:43,625 --> 00:57:45,292
certain things, youngin.'

1120
00:57:45,292 --> 00:57:46,292
You feel me?

1121
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:50,375
I know your brother
shot your father.

1122
00:57:50,375 --> 00:57:51,958
Left him there to
die and take the wrap

1123
00:57:51,958 --> 00:57:53,625
for the murder weapon.

1124
00:57:53,625 --> 00:57:54,417
Oh yeah.

1125
00:57:55,917 --> 00:57:57,417
So your own brother

1126
00:57:57,417 --> 00:58:01,083
is the reason that you had
to grow up without a father.

1127
00:58:01,083 --> 00:58:02,083
Damn.

1128
00:58:02,083 --> 00:58:04,833
If that ain't some ironic shit.

1129
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:07,500
What?

1130
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,292
You don't believe that?

1131
00:58:09,292 --> 00:58:11,792
You think I'm lying?

1132
00:58:11,792 --> 00:58:13,833
Go ask him, then.

1133
00:58:13,833 --> 00:58:16,375
You ask him, and you look him
in the eyes when you ask him.

1134
00:58:16,375 --> 00:58:20,083
See if those eyes don't
tell you the truth.

1135
00:58:37,333 --> 00:58:40,125
- Should I go smoke that fool?

1136
00:58:40,125 --> 00:58:41,750
- Nah, we can't touch him.

1137
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:44,083
I gave Kasada my word.

1138
00:58:44,083 --> 00:58:45,667
- Fuck that, he broke my nose!

1139
00:58:45,667 --> 00:58:46,708
- What, you mad?

1140
00:58:46,708 --> 00:58:49,000
(shrill whimper)

1141
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,708
Be mad at me then, fool.

1142
00:58:51,708 --> 00:58:54,375
Shouldn't have brought
that nigga here anyway.

1143
00:58:54,375 --> 00:58:55,167
Shit.

1144
00:59:01,167 --> 00:59:03,917
- [Kate] Can I help you?

1145
00:59:03,917 --> 00:59:06,292
- Are you Kate Martinez?

1146
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:07,083
- Yes.

1147
00:59:08,208 --> 00:59:11,042
- I'm from Susanville
Penitentiary.

1148
00:59:11,042 --> 00:59:13,958
And I know you were
there recently.

1149
00:59:15,333 --> 00:59:17,875
I also know of a
way where we can

1150
00:59:17,875 --> 00:59:19,625
help each other out.

1151
00:59:19,625 --> 00:59:21,750
- Well, what do you mean?

1152
00:59:28,208 --> 00:59:29,458
Are you okay?

1153
00:59:29,458 --> 00:59:30,833
- Um.

1154
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:32,833
You have a client named,

1155
00:59:33,875 --> 00:59:35,167
James Allen?

1156
00:59:35,167 --> 00:59:36,208
- Yeah.

1157
00:59:37,333 --> 00:59:40,375
- His father's
incarcerated at Susanville.

1158
00:59:40,375 --> 00:59:41,625
Okay?

1159
00:59:41,625 --> 00:59:43,917
I believe this man
is being blackmailed.

1160
00:59:43,917 --> 00:59:45,125
- I knew it, I mean

1161
00:59:45,125 --> 00:59:46,167
that's great to know,
I figured he was

1162
00:59:46,167 --> 00:59:48,792
set up, but I had no
idea who was behind it.

1163
00:59:48,792 --> 00:59:50,042
What else do you know?

1164
00:59:50,042 --> 00:59:52,167
- No, no, I can't
talk about this here.

1165
00:59:52,167 --> 00:59:54,542
- Well can you meet me
somewhere else, then?

1166
00:59:54,542 --> 00:59:56,542
- [Ellis] I'll call you.

1167
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,583
- [Champ] You said you
wanna know who visits him?

1168
01:00:07,583 --> 01:00:09,708
- So spit it out.

1169
01:00:09,708 --> 01:00:13,917
- [Champ] Log shows a lawyer
and his son, Darius Allen.

1170
01:00:16,125 --> 01:00:18,750
- Why would he need a lawyer?

1171
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:20,042
- [Champ] It's not his lawyer,

1172
01:00:20,042 --> 01:00:23,167
it's his other son,
James Allen Jr.'s.

1173
01:00:51,167 --> 01:00:52,792
- Mind if we talk?

1174
01:00:57,125 --> 01:00:58,750
Guess who you're fighting next?

1175
01:00:58,750 --> 01:00:59,542
- Who?

1176
01:01:00,417 --> 01:01:01,208
- Uno.

1177
01:01:05,458 --> 01:01:08,750
- You had this
planned all the time.

1178
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:10,000
Make me the leader
of the blacks,

1179
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,208
fight the leader
of the Mexicans,

1180
01:01:11,208 --> 01:01:13,583
a race war sparks, the
white boys sit back

1181
01:01:13,583 --> 01:01:14,792
and take over.

1182
01:01:18,292 --> 01:01:21,083
- You have a great
day, my friend.

1183
01:01:30,042 --> 01:01:32,917
(cell phone rings)

1184
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:39,292
- Hello?

1185
01:01:42,042 --> 01:01:45,125
Kate, I'm at your
place with food.

1186
01:01:45,125 --> 01:01:49,208
Yeah, I thought you were
done with work by three.

1187
01:01:50,458 --> 01:01:51,250
Oh, okay.

1188
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,375
No, that's fine, I understand.

1189
01:01:57,208 --> 01:01:58,917
Yeah, love you too.

1190
01:02:02,375 --> 01:02:05,250
(cell phone rings)

1191
01:02:06,583 --> 01:02:07,792
Hello?

1192
01:02:07,792 --> 01:02:10,875
- Your shit is
starting to unravel.

1193
01:02:10,875 --> 01:02:13,042
And you need to take care of it,

1194
01:02:13,042 --> 01:02:14,042
now!

1195
01:02:14,042 --> 01:02:16,375
- I went down and got
the videotape, but

1196
01:02:16,375 --> 01:02:19,208
they're just gonna give her
another one in a few days.

1197
01:02:19,208 --> 01:02:22,167
- You said that you
were gonna use people

1198
01:02:22,167 --> 01:02:23,333
that you could control.

1199
01:02:23,333 --> 01:02:25,083
- Yeah, well I thought I could.

1200
01:02:25,083 --> 01:02:28,375
- Look, I am too close, here!

1201
01:02:28,375 --> 01:02:30,000
I'm not gonna let you

1202
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,833
fuck this up for me!

1203
01:02:33,042 --> 01:02:35,167
- Look, there's something else.

1204
01:02:35,167 --> 01:02:37,417
She's made a connection
between the kid and Animal,

1205
01:02:37,417 --> 01:02:38,875
about the blackmail.

1206
01:02:38,875 --> 01:02:40,375
But it's cool, I'm the
only one she's told,

1207
01:02:40,375 --> 01:02:42,000
so I'll handle it.

1208
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,125
- How did she find out?

1209
01:02:47,125 --> 01:02:50,417
- One of the guards,
a guy named Ellis.

1210
01:02:52,833 --> 01:02:54,625
- Alright, look.

1211
01:02:54,625 --> 01:02:56,458
You take care of that lawyer,

1212
01:02:56,458 --> 01:02:59,208
I will take care of Ellis.

1213
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:00,333
- I can't.

1214
01:03:00,333 --> 01:03:02,042
- [Kasada] Just find out
where she fucking lives,

1215
01:03:02,042 --> 01:03:04,000
and I will send somebody.

1216
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,417
- It's not that simple.

1217
01:03:05,417 --> 01:03:07,083
- Look.

1218
01:03:07,083 --> 01:03:10,500
You are not gonna get your
pretty little hands dirty.

1219
01:03:11,667 --> 01:03:13,042
- She's my fiance.

1220
01:03:15,167 --> 01:03:15,958
- What?

1221
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:20,208
You've got to fucking
be kidding me!

1222
01:03:20,208 --> 01:03:23,167
- I'm glad you
find that amusing.

1223
01:03:23,167 --> 01:03:24,583
- You are a bonafide imbecile.

1224
01:03:24,583 --> 01:03:26,708
Why in the world

1225
01:03:26,708 --> 01:03:29,042
would you use your fiance?

1226
01:03:29,042 --> 01:03:33,167
What, because you thought
that you could control her?

1227
01:03:33,167 --> 01:03:34,125
I just hope you can
get the deposit back

1228
01:03:34,125 --> 01:03:36,167
on the wedding cake.

1229
01:03:36,167 --> 01:03:37,833
- [Dillen] What's
that supposed to mean?

1230
01:03:37,833 --> 01:03:39,208
- I mean

1231
01:03:39,208 --> 01:03:40,167
that one of you is
not gonna make it

1232
01:03:40,167 --> 01:03:42,125
to the church on time.

1233
01:03:42,125 --> 01:03:43,833
And I'll let you decide

1234
01:03:43,833 --> 01:03:45,458
which one that is.

1235
01:03:45,458 --> 01:03:48,042
(ominous music)

1236
01:03:49,708 --> 01:03:51,000
- But I love her.

1237
01:03:52,208 --> 01:03:53,792
- Well you should
have thought of that

1238
01:03:53,792 --> 01:03:55,625
before you got her
involved in this.

1239
01:03:55,625 --> 01:03:57,875
Wouldn't you say?

1240
01:03:57,875 --> 01:03:59,125
Now.

1241
01:03:59,125 --> 01:04:01,000
Either you take care of this,

1242
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,042
or my boys will.

1243
01:04:03,042 --> 01:04:05,458
And if my boys
take care of this,

1244
01:04:05,458 --> 01:04:06,250
well...

1245
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:10,000
They like to play
before they work.

1246
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,583
That's all I'm gonna
say on the subject.

1247
01:04:12,583 --> 01:04:15,167
(ominous music)

1248
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:27,042
(car alarm beeps)

1249
01:04:35,958 --> 01:04:38,875
(engine revs)

1250
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,375
(serene music)

1251
01:05:20,375 --> 01:05:22,417
- [Ellis] What's wrong with her?

1252
01:05:22,417 --> 01:05:25,333
- [Man] I think
it's a head gasket.

1253
01:05:27,167 --> 01:05:28,542
- [Ellis] Oh yeah?

1254
01:05:30,708 --> 01:05:32,417
You try starting
it up a few times?

1255
01:05:32,417 --> 01:05:33,833
Sometimes they do that.

1256
01:05:33,833 --> 01:05:36,833
(suspenseful music)

1257
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:39,292
What the hell?

1258
01:05:39,292 --> 01:05:40,083
(gunshot cracks)

1259
01:05:40,083 --> 01:05:42,917
(ominous music)

1260
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
(gunshot cracks)

1261
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,833
(ominous music)

1262
01:06:06,125 --> 01:06:07,958
(gunshots crack)

1263
01:06:07,958 --> 01:06:10,542
(ominous music)

1264
01:06:16,042 --> 01:06:18,417
(engine revs)

1265
01:06:19,833 --> 01:06:22,292
(tires squeal)

1266
01:06:25,333 --> 01:06:28,083
(serene music)

1267
01:07:02,583 --> 01:07:03,375
- James!

1268
01:07:08,375 --> 01:07:09,167
Yo!

1269
01:07:12,167 --> 01:07:12,958
James!

1270
01:07:15,875 --> 01:07:17,000
Hey, hey man.

1271
01:07:22,125 --> 01:07:23,833
What's up?

1272
01:07:23,833 --> 01:07:25,667
Why'd you wanna meet here?

1273
01:07:25,667 --> 01:07:29,667
- Are you the reason
my father's in jail?

1274
01:07:29,667 --> 01:07:31,042
- What?

1275
01:07:31,042 --> 01:07:32,167
- Are you the reason

1276
01:07:32,167 --> 01:07:33,750
my father's in jail?

1277
01:07:37,833 --> 01:07:39,250
- Who told you that?

1278
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:42,167
- Did you shoot my father,
put him in jail for life?

1279
01:07:42,167 --> 01:07:43,542
Don't bullshit me!

1280
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:46,292
- Yeah.

1281
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:50,042
- All this time,
that's why you're

1282
01:07:50,042 --> 01:07:51,583
always on my ass?

1283
01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:56,250
It's 'cause this
shit is your fault?

1284
01:07:57,875 --> 01:08:00,542
Man, I thought it was love.

1285
01:08:00,542 --> 01:08:02,208
- It was, it is, it is.

1286
01:08:02,208 --> 01:08:03,458
- That's bullshit!

1287
01:08:03,458 --> 01:08:04,875
You felt guilty!

1288
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:10,000
This whole shit is a lie.

1289
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:13,167
Your own father.

1290
01:08:14,708 --> 01:08:16,083
- Look James, I'm sorry, man.

1291
01:08:16,083 --> 01:08:18,292
I should have explained it
sooner, man, I should have.

1292
01:08:18,292 --> 01:08:21,833
- Well fuck you and
fuck your sorry, man!

1293
01:08:23,542 --> 01:08:24,417
Your father!

1294
01:08:24,417 --> 01:08:26,208
How does it feel, huh?

1295
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:29,792
How does it feel to
have a gun in your face?

1296
01:08:29,792 --> 01:08:31,083
- James, put the gun down man,

1297
01:08:31,083 --> 01:08:32,417
you don't wanna
do this, alright?

1298
01:08:32,417 --> 01:08:33,208
- Why?

1299
01:08:35,125 --> 01:08:36,375
Huh?

1300
01:08:36,375 --> 01:08:38,042
You did it.

1301
01:08:38,042 --> 01:08:41,083
And now you wanna
beg for your life?

1302
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:44,083
- Look, I'm not
begging for my life.

1303
01:08:44,083 --> 01:08:46,125
I'm begging for yours.

1304
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:50,125
Listen, what's happening
to me right now man,

1305
01:08:50,125 --> 01:08:52,333
I deserve without a doubt.

1306
01:08:55,333 --> 01:08:58,625
I've tried so many times, man.

1307
01:08:58,625 --> 01:09:02,167
To look you in your
eyes man, and tell you.

1308
01:09:02,167 --> 01:09:03,125
What happened.

1309
01:09:06,458 --> 01:09:09,542
Yeah man, we had an argument.

1310
01:09:09,542 --> 01:09:11,208
I was upset.

1311
01:09:11,208 --> 01:09:14,000
'Cause I just found
out about you.

1312
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:19,583
Pop man, he was in prison, man,

1313
01:09:19,583 --> 01:09:20,583
for so long,

1314
01:09:21,875 --> 01:09:26,167
and I'd been waiting
for him my whole life.

1315
01:09:26,167 --> 01:09:29,042
So when he got out, I thought
man, finally, you know?

1316
01:09:29,042 --> 01:09:31,125
Finally, I got my father.

1317
01:09:35,167 --> 01:09:38,167
And it was so cool
for a while, man.

1318
01:09:40,625 --> 01:09:42,417
Then he met your moms.

1319
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,083
They had you.

1320
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:51,333
And he gave you his name.

1321
01:09:55,042 --> 01:09:56,917
Man, that fucked me up.

1322
01:09:59,875 --> 01:10:02,125
I was furious man, I was upset.

1323
01:10:02,125 --> 01:10:03,625
I confronted him.

1324
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:05,500
We argued.

1325
01:10:09,167 --> 01:10:10,500
And I shot him.

1326
01:10:14,667 --> 01:10:17,000
Yeah, I shot my own father.

1327
01:10:20,708 --> 01:10:24,917
And that gun I bought off
the street had murders on it.

1328
01:10:27,125 --> 01:10:30,083
So it was either turn me in,

1329
01:10:30,083 --> 01:10:32,583
or take the wrap for the gun.

1330
01:10:35,792 --> 01:10:38,333
Pop man, he figured,
hey, you know.

1331
01:10:38,333 --> 01:10:41,292
I'm already a two-time loser.

1332
01:10:41,292 --> 01:10:43,708
He was being a father to me.

1333
01:10:48,542 --> 01:10:50,750
And now look at this, man.

1334
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:57,708
You got a gun pointed at me now.

1335
01:11:01,917 --> 01:11:05,500
It's funny how sins
always seen the fathers.

1336
01:11:09,833 --> 01:11:13,250
- Nah, I don't know
what to believe, man.

1337
01:11:13,250 --> 01:11:15,875
- You don't have to
believe me, James.

1338
01:11:15,875 --> 01:11:17,958
Believe in yourself, man.

1339
01:11:17,958 --> 01:11:19,750
Put the gun down, man.

1340
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:37,667
It's all good, man.

1341
01:11:51,125 --> 01:11:52,250
- I told you.

1342
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:00,917
- Hey.

1343
01:12:00,917 --> 01:12:03,208
I never doubted you for
a second, little brother.

1344
01:12:03,208 --> 01:12:05,708
I never doubted you
for a second, man.

1345
01:12:05,708 --> 01:12:09,125
- We'll show this to
the judge tomorrow.

1346
01:12:13,667 --> 01:12:14,958
- Well you know what?

1347
01:12:14,958 --> 01:12:15,833
I think we should
celebrate, man.

1348
01:12:15,833 --> 01:12:16,958
Huh?

1349
01:12:16,958 --> 01:12:18,417
Kate, stay for dinner.

1350
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:19,875
- I would love to, but
my fiance's planning

1351
01:12:19,875 --> 01:12:21,500
dinner for me at home.

1352
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:22,542
- Okay.

1353
01:12:22,542 --> 01:12:25,500
So uh, listen, you and um.

1354
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:27,250
Your man's name, was?

1355
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:30,542
- Dillen, he's actually the
assistant district attorney.

1356
01:12:30,542 --> 01:12:32,750
- Cool, okay, well, um.

1357
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:34,833
Listen, you and Dillen,

1358
01:12:34,833 --> 01:12:37,042
you guys have a
wonderful time tonight.

1359
01:12:37,042 --> 01:12:39,625
(ominous music)

1360
01:13:18,042 --> 01:13:20,667
(phone rings)

1361
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:23,792
- Hello?

1362
01:13:23,792 --> 01:13:25,042
- [Voiceover] You
have a collect call

1363
01:13:25,042 --> 01:13:26,083
from James Allen, do
you accept the charges?

1364
01:13:26,083 --> 01:13:27,000
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I accept the charges.

1365
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,083
- [Voiceover] Go ahead, sir.

1366
01:13:29,083 --> 01:13:30,000
- Pop, hey.

1367
01:13:31,542 --> 01:13:33,250
Hey, check it, we got the video.

1368
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:34,833
- Good.

1369
01:13:34,833 --> 01:13:36,000
Have you seen it?

1370
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,125
- Yeah, it shows that
James didn't do it.

1371
01:13:38,125 --> 01:13:40,333
- Where's the video?

1372
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:42,208
- Nah, Kate has it, she's
taking it to court this morning.

1373
01:13:42,208 --> 01:13:43,083
- Kate has it?

1374
01:13:43,083 --> 01:13:44,667
Why don't you have it?

1375
01:13:44,667 --> 01:13:47,083
- No, trust me Pop, Kate won't
let nothing happen to it.

1376
01:13:47,083 --> 01:13:49,083
- Look, I don't
know Kate, you know,

1377
01:13:49,083 --> 01:13:50,875
I don't trust Kate.

1378
01:13:50,875 --> 01:13:51,625
- Pop.

1379
01:13:51,625 --> 01:13:52,417
Calm down okay?

1380
01:13:52,417 --> 01:13:53,333
I understand.

1381
01:13:53,333 --> 01:13:55,542
- No, you don't understand.

1382
01:13:55,542 --> 01:13:57,333
I have to do something
today that might cause

1383
01:13:57,333 --> 01:14:00,250
all hell to break
loose in this prison.

1384
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:04,042
Now unless that tape is
in court, I have to do it.

1385
01:14:04,042 --> 01:14:05,708
- Pop, trust me.

1386
01:14:05,708 --> 01:14:06,708
I've seen it.

1387
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:08,833
It's a for sure thing.

1388
01:14:08,833 --> 01:14:09,625
- Darius.

1389
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,208
This thing goes way high.

1390
01:14:15,208 --> 01:14:18,208
The assistant D.A., the warden.

1391
01:14:18,208 --> 01:14:20,833
- Wait, wait, wait, hold
up, what did you say?

1392
01:14:20,833 --> 01:14:23,167
The assistant district attorney?

1393
01:14:23,167 --> 01:14:24,333
- [Animal] Yeah.

1394
01:14:26,042 --> 01:14:26,833
- Dillen!

1395
01:14:28,125 --> 01:14:31,750
- What, what, you know
city officials now?

1396
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:33,167
- No, no, no, no, Pop,
you don't understand,

1397
01:14:33,167 --> 01:14:35,125
that's Kate's fiance!

1398
01:14:36,208 --> 01:14:37,708
- Are you sure about this?

1399
01:14:37,708 --> 01:14:41,042
- I'm absolutely sure, I mean.

1400
01:14:41,042 --> 01:14:42,917
What you want me to do?

1401
01:14:48,208 --> 01:14:49,000
- Dillen.

1402
01:14:51,667 --> 01:14:54,083
What happened, are you okay?

1403
01:14:56,208 --> 01:14:58,875
- Yeah, I was at
work, I fell asleep.

1404
01:14:58,875 --> 01:15:00,125
I'm fine.

1405
01:15:00,125 --> 01:15:02,875
- I waited up and I called you.

1406
01:15:03,958 --> 01:15:05,667
I was really worried.

1407
01:15:07,708 --> 01:15:09,792
- Look, I'm okay, I just...

1408
01:15:09,792 --> 01:15:11,583
Have a lot on my mind.

1409
01:15:13,458 --> 01:15:15,375
I brought you a coffee.

1410
01:15:17,042 --> 01:15:20,875
- I smell alcohol, were
you drinking last night?

1411
01:15:20,875 --> 01:15:22,042
- Yeah, earlier.

1412
01:15:23,458 --> 01:15:27,458
The D.A. wanted to talk,
we had a couple drinks.

1413
01:15:30,208 --> 01:15:34,125
- There's something
you wanna tell me?

1414
01:15:34,125 --> 01:15:35,125
- Like what?

1415
01:15:36,583 --> 01:15:38,583
- Is there someone else?

1416
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:41,292
- No.

1417
01:15:41,292 --> 01:15:42,208
No.

1418
01:15:42,208 --> 01:15:44,958
Don't be silly, it's just work.

1419
01:15:47,083 --> 01:15:51,250
- I know I've been a pain
lately with this case and all.

1420
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:54,208
I feel like a weight
has been lifted.

1421
01:15:54,208 --> 01:15:55,000
My God.

1422
01:15:56,083 --> 01:15:59,375
And this was just my first case.

1423
01:15:59,375 --> 01:16:00,375
What a rush.

1424
01:16:05,375 --> 01:16:09,125
It's everything I
was dreaming about.

1425
01:16:09,125 --> 01:16:11,500
Making a difference, you know?

1426
01:16:13,125 --> 01:16:14,708
Oh.

1427
01:16:14,708 --> 01:16:17,417
And you will follow up
on that prison situation?

1428
01:16:17,417 --> 01:16:19,958
It's disgusting what's
been going on in there.

1429
01:16:19,958 --> 01:16:21,208
And I'm gonna try
and reopen the case

1430
01:16:21,208 --> 01:16:23,125
against James Allen Sr.

1431
01:16:25,458 --> 01:16:27,000
Listen to me.

1432
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,042
I'm babbling.

1433
01:16:29,042 --> 01:16:32,208
Okay, I'll stop talking
shop, I promise.

1434
01:16:35,917 --> 01:16:38,917
I'm sorry I've been
so distant from you.

1435
01:16:38,917 --> 01:16:39,708
But.

1436
01:16:40,833 --> 01:16:43,000
I'm gonna make it up to you.

1437
01:16:44,292 --> 01:16:45,208
I love you.

1438
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:48,792
So.

1439
01:16:50,042 --> 01:16:52,458
Here's to our life together.

1440
01:16:59,333 --> 01:17:00,250
- Oh, shit.

1441
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:07,625
(cell phone rings)

1442
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:16,542
- Hello?

1443
01:17:16,542 --> 01:17:17,667
- Hey Kate, listen.

1444
01:17:17,667 --> 01:17:19,125
I just talked to my father.

1445
01:17:19,125 --> 01:17:21,208
And your fiance is part
of this whole thing.

1446
01:17:21,208 --> 01:17:23,792
(ominous music)

1447
01:17:27,542 --> 01:17:29,208
- What are you talking about?

1448
01:17:29,208 --> 01:17:30,833
- Listen, some man named Kasada

1449
01:17:30,833 --> 01:17:32,125
has some kind of dirt on him.

1450
01:17:32,125 --> 01:17:33,458
And he made him help

1451
01:17:33,458 --> 01:17:35,542
frame James Jr.

1452
01:17:35,542 --> 01:17:37,500
- Hey, don't be ridiculous.

1453
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:39,000
- Listen, everything
my father is doing

1454
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,750
is for James, he wouldn't
lie about this, alright?

1455
01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:46,167
Kate, my father might not
be sure about you, but I am.

1456
01:17:46,167 --> 01:17:49,083
Okay, and I know you have
nothing to do with this.

1457
01:17:49,083 --> 01:17:51,083
Which means you're in danger.

1458
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:53,417
Okay, so listen, tell
me where you are.

1459
01:17:53,417 --> 01:17:54,958
- What if you're wrong?

1460
01:17:54,958 --> 01:17:55,750
- Kate.

1461
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:57,000
Listen to me.

1462
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,500
They cannot let that
tape go to court today.

1463
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:02,042
Alright, listen, if I'm wrong,

1464
01:18:02,042 --> 01:18:03,375
so what?

1465
01:18:03,375 --> 01:18:07,125
But if I'm right, they
gotta get rid of you.

1466
01:18:07,125 --> 01:18:08,167
Okay?

1467
01:18:08,167 --> 01:18:09,000
So please, tell me

1468
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,208
where you are.

1469
01:18:11,833 --> 01:18:13,083
- I'm at home.

1470
01:18:13,083 --> 01:18:14,125
- Alright, you're at home.

1471
01:18:14,125 --> 01:18:15,792
Let me get the address.

1472
01:18:15,792 --> 01:18:17,083
- [Kate] I'm not going to--

1473
01:18:17,083 --> 01:18:19,375
- Look, just tell
me what it is, damn!

1474
01:18:19,375 --> 01:18:21,958
- It's 12 Collins,
apartment five.

1475
01:18:21,958 --> 01:18:22,750
But I'm with--

1476
01:18:22,750 --> 01:18:24,167
- I'm on my way.

1477
01:18:25,375 --> 01:18:27,000
Dillen's involved.

1478
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,042
- [James] Let's go.

1479
01:18:28,042 --> 01:18:29,208
- No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

1480
01:18:29,208 --> 01:18:31,083
No, you got court today, so uh.

1481
01:18:31,083 --> 01:18:32,333
Um, look.

1482
01:18:32,333 --> 01:18:34,042
I'll meet you in the
court parking lot

1483
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:35,458
later, okay?

1484
01:18:35,458 --> 01:18:38,042
(ominous music)

1485
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,500
- What does Kasada have on you?

1486
01:18:54,417 --> 01:18:57,333
Now I know why I
only had one case.

1487
01:18:59,208 --> 01:19:02,500
Why you pulled strings
to get me hired.

1488
01:19:10,042 --> 01:19:13,458
- It was never supposed
to go this far.

1489
01:19:13,458 --> 01:19:16,000
Kate, you gotta believe me.

1490
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,167
- But you want to stop me
from going to court today.

1491
01:19:19,167 --> 01:19:22,000
(ominous music)

1492
01:19:24,042 --> 01:19:25,083
Oh my God!

1493
01:19:26,542 --> 01:19:27,333
Dillen.

1494
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,917
- Kate, they were
gonna hurt you.

1495
01:19:33,875 --> 01:19:34,792
And this way.

1496
01:19:34,792 --> 01:19:37,167
- And this way, what, Dillen?

1497
01:19:37,167 --> 01:19:38,375
This way what?

1498
01:19:54,167 --> 01:19:57,000
(metallic squeaking)

1499
01:19:59,542 --> 01:20:03,333
- Im'a go in here and
I'ma whoop some ass now.

1500
01:20:12,042 --> 01:20:14,875
(metallic slam)

1501
01:20:18,208 --> 01:20:20,792
(radio chatter)

1502
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:24,000
- Hey, um.

1503
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,500
So how's she doing?

1504
01:20:26,667 --> 01:20:29,125
- She was poisoned with
trimenidal chloride.

1505
01:20:29,125 --> 01:20:32,667
If you hadn't gotten
here when you did...

1506
01:20:32,667 --> 01:20:35,000
Let's just say she's very lucky.

1507
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,333
And also, whoever did
this wasn't aware that

1508
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:40,625
caffeine actually
minimizes the effect.

1509
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,875
- Oh hey, thanks.

1510
01:20:43,875 --> 01:20:46,458
(radio chatter)

1511
01:20:47,875 --> 01:20:49,083
Hey.

1512
01:20:49,083 --> 01:20:50,417
- What time is it?

1513
01:20:50,417 --> 01:20:51,542
- Look, don't worry
about that, you know,

1514
01:20:51,542 --> 01:20:53,667
you just need to relax.

1515
01:20:53,667 --> 01:20:55,667
- I have to get to court.

1516
01:20:55,667 --> 01:20:57,000
The arraignment's at.

1517
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,125
- Wait, wait, wait just
slow down, slow down,

1518
01:20:58,125 --> 01:21:01,458
alright, sit your ass
down, just don't move.

1519
01:21:01,458 --> 01:21:03,750
Listen, you're going
to the hospital.

1520
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:05,042
We'll get down there,

1521
01:21:05,042 --> 01:21:09,083
and we'll tell them everything
that happened, okay?

1522
01:21:09,083 --> 01:21:10,417
- There's too much
riding on this,

1523
01:21:10,417 --> 01:21:13,125
we can't give them another
chance to cover it up.

1524
01:21:13,125 --> 01:21:15,500
Until we get James cleared,
your father's in danger.

1525
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:17,167
- Alright well wait a minute,
you want me to drive you?

1526
01:21:17,167 --> 01:21:18,208
Hold up.

1527
01:21:30,958 --> 01:21:31,958
- Mr. Mason.

1528
01:21:31,958 --> 01:21:34,167
What brings you down here today?

1529
01:21:34,167 --> 01:21:36,375
- Just a little observation.

1530
01:21:36,375 --> 01:21:37,792
What's on the docket?

1531
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:39,208
- The James Allen murder case.

1532
01:21:39,208 --> 01:21:40,250
You know it?

1533
01:21:40,250 --> 01:21:41,333
- Well sure, I heard about it.

1534
01:21:41,333 --> 01:21:42,625
How's it going?

1535
01:21:42,625 --> 01:21:44,042
- Kid didn't show
up with his lawyer.

1536
01:21:44,042 --> 01:21:48,208
Judge revoked bail, we
just broke for lunch.

1537
01:21:48,208 --> 01:21:50,542
- What case you working on?

1538
01:21:53,833 --> 01:21:57,333
- I apologize for being
late, but I was detained.

1539
01:21:57,333 --> 01:21:58,708
- Kate.

1540
01:21:58,708 --> 01:21:59,500
I can explain.

1541
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:01,458
- No, just stop.

1542
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:02,583
Okay?

1543
01:22:02,583 --> 01:22:04,083
Just stop.

1544
01:22:04,083 --> 01:22:05,500
Stop, just shut up, okay?

1545
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:07,458
I don't wanna hear it anymore!

1546
01:22:07,458 --> 01:22:08,250
That's enough!

1547
01:22:08,250 --> 01:22:09,292
- Hey.

1548
01:22:09,292 --> 01:22:11,458
What's going on out here?

1549
01:22:11,458 --> 01:22:13,042
- Your Honor,

1550
01:22:13,042 --> 01:22:15,167
I have a video that fully
exonerates my client.

1551
01:22:15,167 --> 01:22:17,250
And proves he was framed.

1552
01:22:18,417 --> 01:22:20,125
This is the evidence, this tape.

1553
01:22:20,125 --> 01:22:21,208
- Not here.

1554
01:22:21,208 --> 01:22:22,500
- Kate.

1555
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:25,083
- I want everyone in my chamber.

1556
01:22:36,458 --> 01:22:39,042
(ominous music)

1557
01:22:41,625 --> 01:22:43,375
- Don't be so serious.

1558
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:45,375
This is going to be fun.

1559
01:22:54,167 --> 01:22:55,500
Here's Uno.

1560
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:58,792
