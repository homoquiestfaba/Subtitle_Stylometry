00:00:26,977 --> 00:00:32,864
Final Destination 5

2
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,867
Hey, Sam, when I say would you mind
putting breakfast together for the retreat,

3
00:03:50,004 --> 00:03:51,886
I meant like donuts,

4
00:03:52,006 --> 00:03:53,064
and some coffee ?

5
00:03:53,207 --> 00:03:54,970
- This is amazing!
- Thanks man!

6
00:03:55,075 --> 00:03:57,976
Just remember that when you see
my sales report for last month.

7
00:03:58,078 --> 00:04:00,137
- I saw it last night.
- Shit!

8
00:04:00,497 --> 00:04:02,931
- Has Dennis seen it ?
- Not yet.

9
00:04:03,051 --> 00:04:05,076
Look, you just
make a decision.

10
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,155
You know? You gonna be chef
or you gonna be ???.

11
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:11,526
I'm telling you as a friend,
because, as your boss,

12
00:04:11,993 --> 00:04:13,671
I'm ready to fire your ass.

13
00:04:14,029 --> 00:04:16,378
And as a friend
I appreciate that advice.

14
00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:23,069
Hold on, I'll be right back!

15
00:04:30,212 --> 00:04:32,908
Molly, your tickets' cancels.

16
00:04:33,082 --> 00:04:35,051
I told him that is a mistake.

17
00:04:35,152 --> 00:04:37,017
I was going to tell you after
this weekend.

18
00:04:37,187 --> 00:04:40,088
- To tell me what?
- That I don't...

19
00:04:40,157 --> 00:04:42,022
I don't think it's such a good idea.

20
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,746
What? The trip?

21
00:04:44,194 --> 00:04:45,991
And my brother's wedding.

22
00:04:47,064 --> 00:04:50,158
- What's going on here?
- We should talk about this later...

23
00:04:50,626 --> 00:04:53,817
And to pretend that I haven't seen
these for the next 2 days?

24
00:04:53,937 --> 00:04:55,507
No, let's talk about this now.

25
00:04:55,973 --> 00:04:57,639
It's not working out, Sam.

26
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:00,934
We're not working out.

27
00:05:06,117 --> 00:05:10,053
It's Candice, right?

28
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:13,972
Okay sorry, this is not a vacation.

29
00:05:14,092 --> 00:05:18,119
It's a business retreat. We'll on
business for the next 2 days.

30
00:05:18,997 --> 00:05:20,021
I'm sorry.

31
00:05:20,164 --> 00:05:24,122
I love you but this doesn't change
the fact that you are still an intern.

32
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,889
That 12:30 curfew tonight,
you shouldn't planning on breaking that.

33
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:31,976
Why ?

34
00:05:32,076 --> 00:05:34,413
For the naked team belling. (???)

35
00:05:51,965 --> 00:05:54,058
Hey, Olivia, don't forget these.

36
00:05:54,968 --> 00:05:57,198
Oh, yeah. I've been trying to.

37
00:05:58,104 --> 00:06:01,096
Why ? I like it, it's very ... Lisa Lope (???)

38
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:05,757
Oh, you know, I'll rather be very...
Olivia.

39
00:06:07,047 --> 00:06:10,142
- We gonna giggle soomeday. (???)
- Yeah, I'll be there.

40
00:06:12,953 --> 00:06:15,256
Good morning, Peter.
You looking good.

41
00:06:16,123 --> 00:06:19,957
???

42
00:06:20,027 --> 00:06:24,123
Candice, do you actually get paid for
this internship or it just increase your ... ?

43
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:28,127
You know, if you wanna me get rid of that
baby fat you should try the gym.

44
00:06:29,003 --> 00:06:30,163
Like those working machines in your back.

45
00:06:32,973 --> 00:06:34,372
Sweety, it's not fat.

46
00:06:36,944 --> 00:06:38,172
They're called tits.

47
00:06:41,736 --> 00:06:43,949
You are not looking so hot,
this morning.

48
00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:45,143
???

49
00:06:45,724 --> 00:06:48,908
Look, have you tried that
thing that your boyfriend made ?

50
00:06:49,771 --> 00:06:52,023
And this was it is ?
That's touch your nerve ?

51
00:06:52,127 --> 00:06:54,960
- Leave me in peace, Isaac.
- Listen, MO. Mo, look at me.

52
00:06:55,163 --> 00:06:57,913
Look at me. If you want to talk to someone,

53
00:06:58,033 --> 00:07:01,025
I'm a very good listener.
Wait, don't say anything.

54
00:07:01,136 --> 00:07:03,001
???.

55
00:07:03,205 --> 00:07:05,887
Hey, let's sit together on the bus?

56
00:07:06,007 --> 00:07:08,719
No, I remember you.

57
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:10,334
- You know what you sould do ?
- What ?

58
00:07:10,454 --> 00:07:12,114
- You should apologize.
- Why ?

59
00:07:12,216 --> 00:07:14,480
It does not matter. It never matters.

60
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,934
Only... say
I'm sorry, cause I...

61
00:07:17,054 --> 00:07:18,112
Oh, shit!

62
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:27,760
Hi Stand, how is it going?

63
00:07:28,966 --> 00:07:31,439
- It Sam, sir.
- Did you just correct me ?

64
00:07:33,516 --> 00:07:37,071
- No.
- Look at me. What's my name ?

65
00:07:37,941 --> 00:07:40,000
- Dennis.
- Look away.

66
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,011
- All right, Pete?
- Yes, yes sir.

67
00:07:42,113 --> 00:07:43,895
We are just waiting for Nathan.

68
00:07:44,015 --> 00:07:46,097
What's the only thing that
we can not recycle, Pete ?

69
00:07:46,217 --> 00:07:48,833
- Wasted time, sir.
- Exactly.

70
00:07:48,953 --> 00:07:50,869
We'll be in the road in 90 seconds.

71
00:07:50,989 --> 00:07:53,924
I'll go tracked them down. (???)

72
00:07:54,025 --> 00:07:56,808
It's a good thing
showing initiative, Stand.

73
00:07:56,928 --> 00:07:59,061
It's gonna be a good day.

74
00:08:13,691 --> 00:08:15,113
You know? I'm just trying to make sense.

75
00:08:15,214 --> 00:08:18,911
3 weeks ago they brought you as an assistant of manager.

76
00:08:19,051 --> 00:08:21,901
- And now, they give you a day off ?
- It's not a day off.

77
00:08:22,021 --> 00:08:23,921
- It's a re...
- Re... what?

78
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:27,022
- Retarded?
- Retreat.

79
00:08:27,193 --> 00:08:29,058
It's a retreat.

80
00:08:29,178 --> 00:08:32,131
I do not want to go, I just follow the orders,
then if you do not like, you can ...

81
00:08:32,232 --> 00:08:33,995
What? Can I what?

82
00:08:34,134 --> 00:08:36,426
Hey, hey, come on,
we are waiting for you!

83
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:39,229
- It's  Okay.
- No, wait. Wait.

84
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,022
What were you saying?
What were you saying?

85
00:08:42,142 --> 00:08:44,007
There are at least 15 years of working here.

86
00:08:44,177 --> 00:08:46,908
You got what ?
4 years in a class?

87
00:08:47,048 --> 00:08:49,831
- Listen, I'm tired...
- It's not a good idea, Roy.

88
00:08:49,951 --> 00:08:51,043
It is not a good idea, come on.

89
00:08:51,219 --> 00:08:53,210
We had it good today.

90
00:08:57,254 --> 00:08:59,051
How do you get away with that ?

91
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,809
I had no choice.
And he's the union representative.

92
00:09:01,929 --> 00:09:04,846
I fire him and suddenly I got
a room full of complaints.

93
00:09:04,966 --> 00:09:07,081
But I ???, even
if it kills me.

94
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:11,103
What about you ? You've already decided what
to do with the offer of the restaurant ?

95
00:09:11,205 --> 00:09:14,140
- I already did.
- That's just great!

96
00:09:14,942 --> 00:09:18,208
No, you know, they... They want to send
someone at the restaurant in Paris.

97
00:09:18,328 --> 00:09:21,830
But, who knows for how long ?
Could be 6 months, one year...

98
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,071
Just thought I'll leaving
too much behind.

99
00:09:28,023 --> 00:09:32,050
- I'm not so sure.
- Well, if you go to Paris,

100
00:09:32,227 --> 00:09:34,195
- Do me a favor.
- What's that?

101
00:09:35,163 --> 00:09:37,881
- Take her with you.
- Oh no!

102
00:09:48,978 --> 00:09:52,915
- Are you coming?
- Yeah.

103
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,165
What are those for?

104
00:10:19,177 --> 00:10:21,077
They just help me relax.

105
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,402
And for luck.

106
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:27,933
Gymnasts are worse than baseball players.

107
00:10:28,053 --> 00:10:29,793
She's superstitious.

108
00:10:31,056 --> 00:10:33,024
Hey, how are you doing?

109
00:10:33,992 --> 00:10:37,985
No, just a stupid retreat thing with
idiots from the office.

110
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:41,064
No not you sir, them.

111
00:10:41,232 --> 00:10:43,837
hold on a second.
I'm going to a place with more privacy.

112
00:10:45,003 --> 00:10:47,573
It's a great idea, sir.
A brilliant idea.

113
00:10:47,972 --> 00:10:50,965
Hang on a second babe.
I'm just heading to my private office.

114
00:12:21,236 --> 00:12:22,589
Damn it!

115
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:56,006
- Peter, have you heard that?
- What?

116
00:12:57,142 --> 00:12:59,042
There's something wrong.

117
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:19,527
Mo, come on!

118
00:13:26,204 --> 00:13:27,757
Candice! Candice!

119
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:42,198
No!

120
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:47,159
Come on, Peter, come on!

121
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,085
Come on, Mo!

122
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,096
What the fuck... ?

123
00:14:19,093 --> 00:14:20,185
Shit!

124
00:14:27,035 --> 00:14:28,093
This way!

125
00:14:43,018 --> 00:14:44,144
Come on, come on!

126
00:14:44,954 --> 00:14:46,558
Do not look down!

127
00:14:49,024 --> 00:14:50,816
Go on, go on!

128
00:15:05,108 --> 00:15:07,099
Help me, help me!

129
00:15:07,243 --> 00:15:10,473
Wait! Olivia, here. Come.

130
00:15:15,953 --> 00:15:17,215
Continue..

131
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:20,922
Try to follow
Molly's voice, okay?

132
00:15:21,158 --> 00:15:22,955
Follow her voice.

133
00:15:32,136 --> 00:15:34,588
- Come on!
- Help me!

134
00:16:35,102 --> 00:16:37,003
Peter, hurry up!

135
00:17:04,999 --> 00:17:06,091
Hold on!

136
00:17:08,137 --> 00:17:09,968
Come on! Come on!

137
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:21,208
Hold on, Sam!

138
00:17:54,217 --> 00:17:55,981
Damn it!

139
00:18:13,232 --> 00:18:14,996
We all got to get off!

140
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,600
- What are you talking about?
- The bridge is gonna collapse!

141
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,203
- What?
- We all gotta die!

142
00:18:20,323 --> 00:18:21,294
What the hell is going on?

143
00:18:21,414 --> 00:18:23,879
We all gonna die, if we do not go
off of this bridge, now!

144
00:18:23,999 --> 00:18:25,279
What?

145
00:18:25,418 --> 00:18:28,633
Stan Relax!
It's just some construction.

146
00:18:29,332 --> 00:18:30,285
Come on !

147
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:33,254
Please follow me!

148
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:35,259
Open the door!

149
00:18:37,263 --> 00:18:41,257
That's a big problem,
deal with it.

150
00:18:41,368 --> 00:18:43,268
- Yeah.
- Then, go get them.

151
00:18:43,403 --> 00:18:44,529
Yeah.

152
00:18:46,406 --> 00:18:49,398
- Sam, Molly!
- Peter, please, follow us!

153
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,225
Come on! Let's go!

154
00:18:51,345 --> 00:18:53,438
- Well, calm down!
- I'm going to help.

155
00:18:53,547 --> 00:18:54,740
Please.

156
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,474
Hey, guys! Come on!

157
00:18:57,996 --> 00:18:59,994
Go back to the bus,
that we talk about it!

158
00:19:01,255 --> 00:19:03,223
Molly, Sam, come on, guys!

159
00:19:07,494 --> 00:19:09,939
Do not you think it's weird
they are off the bus?

160
00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:12,147
It is not right.
It's like he just snaps.

161
00:19:12,267 --> 00:19:14,519
- What happens?
- What the hell is going on here?

162
00:19:24,547 --> 00:19:27,380
Get off!
Get off the bus!

163
00:19:42,498 --> 00:19:43,523
Come on!

164
00:20:05,322 --> 00:20:07,187
How did you know?

165
00:20:15,399 --> 00:20:17,230
That's the big question.

166
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,435
How did you know?

167
00:20:20,742 --> 00:20:26,190
It says, "I saw it collapse.
I knew it would happen. "

168
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:30,247
- It seems premeditated to me.
- No, it's not what I meant.

169
00:20:32,652 --> 00:20:34,477
I ... I had a vision.

170
00:20:35,286 --> 00:20:37,380
Ok, a vision.

171
00:20:38,063 --> 00:20:43,251
Physic phenomenon. Ghosts. Bigfoot.
You actually believe in that stuff?

172
00:20:43,371 --> 00:20:44,677
I don't know.

173
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:50,995
I'll tell you what I believe.
There's an answer for everything.

174
00:20:51,115 --> 00:20:52,265
Which means that there is an
answer. You knew,

175
00:20:52,372 --> 00:20:54,340
because you warned that
the bridge was about to collapse,

176
00:20:54,474 --> 00:20:57,190
and minutes later, it did.

177
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,159
I told you, I saw
it coming.

178
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:00,954
I don't know how.

179
00:21:01,873 --> 00:21:03,761
I just did.

180
00:21:05,076 --> 00:21:08,440
- And no one else did.
- Like I said,

181
00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:10,465
It just came out of nowhere.

182
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:16,438
Has Sam ever showed some
extremist behavior?

183
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:17,404
No.

184
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,739
Wait. Extremist behavior?

185
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,242
You mean like terrorist?

186
00:21:24,362 --> 00:21:27,690
Did you see him talked to anyone that morning,
on the cellphone...?

187
00:21:28,131 --> 00:21:31,152
Just his girlfriend.
His ex-girlfriend.

188
00:21:31,272 --> 00:21:34,673
Mo, Molly, that was in person.

189
00:21:35,282 --> 00:21:37,866
Very well, thank you.

190
00:21:38,696 --> 00:21:41,235
Tell me about the break-up.
Was he upset?

191
00:21:41,714 --> 00:21:43,665
On a scale of 1 to 10.

192
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:46,483
It's personal.

193
00:21:47,776 --> 00:21:51,146
He must have been pissed, right?
Getting dupped like that.

194
00:21:51,713 --> 00:21:53,248
What's it all about?

195
00:21:53,368 --> 00:21:56,360
I'm just trying to put
all the pieces of the puzzle together,

196
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,214
before I make them moving around, making them fit.

197
00:22:00,334 --> 00:22:04,159
Look, I just had a hunch that
something bad was going to happen.

198
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:05,279
That's it.

199
00:22:07,383 --> 00:22:08,441
Excuse me.

200
00:22:12,744 --> 00:22:14,974
They came back with the analysis.

201
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:16,239
And?

202
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:19,602
Strong gusts of wind have
weakened the structure of the building.

203
00:22:19,722 --> 00:22:23,430
- The wind!
- That's it, let go of the boy.

204
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:26,434
You free to go.

205
00:22:32,342 --> 00:22:35,325
I have a feeling that we'll see each
other again.

206
00:22:35,999 --> 00:22:37,379
Call it a hunch.

207
00:22:44,421 --> 00:22:47,722
<i>Authorities are now calling
the Northbay bridge collapse</i>

208
00:22:47,842 --> 00:22:49,744
<i>a freak act of nature,</i>

209
00:22:49,864 --> 00:22:52,235
<i> signaling that the highway
improvement project</i>

210
00:22:52,355 --> 00:22:54,395
<i>may have weakened
the super structure.</i>

211
00:22:54,465 --> 00:22:58,367
<i>Among the survivors, there are 8 employees
of Pressage Paper</i>

212
00:22:58,469 --> 00:23:00,916
<i>on a way to
to a business retreat.</i>

213
00:23:01,036 --> 00:23:04,255
<i>The another 17 employees
were killed in the collapse.</i>

214
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:07,258
<i>And although they were labelled the lucky 8,</i>

215
00:23:07,378 --> 00:23:11,445
<i>the surviving employees
now face an uncertain future.</i>

216
00:23:36,443 --> 00:23:39,292
Does anyone know when this is
suppose to start?

217
00:23:39,412 --> 00:23:42,347
- When Dennis gets here.
- Hey, guys.

218
00:23:45,351 --> 00:23:47,512
- ???
- No..

219
00:23:48,321 --> 00:23:50,448
You heard the news, they say it was natural causes.

220
00:23:52,325 --> 00:23:55,261
They are more like supernatural.

221
00:23:55,396 --> 00:23:57,523
Are you holding up? I try calling.

222
00:23:58,332 --> 00:23:59,913
Yeah, I know. I saw it.

223
00:24:00,501 --> 00:24:02,059
I'm just tired.

224
00:24:03,437 --> 00:24:07,339
So? How did you explain that?

225
00:24:10,377 --> 00:24:14,279
I didn't. I couldn't.

226
00:24:14,482 --> 00:24:18,543
- Sam, how do you reason?
- That's exactly what the agent keep saying.

227
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:26,488
Whatever answer you are looking for,
I don't have it.

228
00:24:27,072 --> 00:24:29,320
Sam is right.
It doesn't matter how it happens.

229
00:24:29,431 --> 00:24:32,651
We should put this behind us and we must be
grateful that we are still alive.

230
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:37,495
???, right?

231
00:24:38,373 --> 00:24:43,843
<i> I look at people's faces
today, and I see family members, friends,</i>

232
00:24:44,514 --> 00:24:47,962
but the people that left us on ton the bridge that day,

233
00:24:48,082 --> 00:24:49,580
They were some than that..

234
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,715
<i>People like Jerry Obertcon,</i>

235
00:24:54,014 --> 00:24:55,423

236
00:24:57,316 --> 00:24:58,678

00:25:07,794 --> 00:25:10,996
Who can forget
Winks's smile?

240
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:17,170
- Or Isaac Palmer.
- He just said my name?

241
00:25:18,758 --> 00:25:20,626
- It's not funny.
- I'm sorry.

242
00:25:20,746 --> 00:25:23,431
You're right, I'm sorry.

243
00:25:25,522 --> 00:25:29,922
- I see dead people.
- Guys.

244
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:40,856
Death...

245
00:25:43,404 --> 00:25:45,256
doesn't like to be cheatted.

246
00:25:45,376 --> 00:25:48,447
Excuse me?
What's that supposed to mean?

247
00:25:52,705 --> 00:25:55,714
You all, just be careful now.

248
00:25:55,834 --> 00:26:00,846
Ok, thanks for the advice.
Creepy guy.

249
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:59,433
- What's the manner?
- He said that's got no flavor.

250
00:27:00,816 --> 00:27:03,354
- Did he want something else?
- No, he checked.

251
00:27:06,965 --> 00:27:08,529
Let me taste it.

252
00:27:14,302 --> 00:27:17,328
The customer is an asshole.
It's good.

253
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:31,377
Hold on!

254
00:27:44,818 --> 00:27:47,370
- Do you mind if I come in?
- Yeah, sure.

255
00:27:58,115 --> 00:28:01,165
- Thanks.
- I thought you'll be working tonight.

256
00:28:01,285 --> 00:28:04,557
Yeah, I worked
the first shift, but

257
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,796
I had to do something else.

258
00:28:14,004 --> 00:28:18,255
- Can I?
- Oh, yes, sure. Go ahead.

259
00:29:11,898 --> 00:29:12,778
Thank you.

260
00:29:14,328 --> 00:29:15,420
Listen...

261
00:29:17,365 --> 00:29:19,827
When everything was going down
on that bridge,

262
00:29:23,271 --> 00:29:25,237
The only thing that I thought was about you.

263
00:29:27,172 --> 00:29:28,727
Getting you to safety.

264
00:29:29,758 --> 00:29:32,887
You're the only thing
I care about, Molly.

265
00:29:36,043 --> 00:29:40,497
- Whatever is wrong, I can fix it.
- You haven't done anything wrong.

266
00:29:42,411 --> 00:29:44,432
Then what?
What is it?

267
00:29:45,895 --> 00:29:48,462
- Paris.
- We've talk about that.

268
00:29:48,582 --> 00:29:50,901
I'm not going
to give up my life.

269
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:56,091
- Leave you for that job.
- But it's the only thing you've ever dreamed of.

270
00:29:58,928 --> 00:30:01,017
Life is too short, Sam.

271
00:30:01,137 --> 00:30:05,560
- You have to go after what you love.
- I am.

272
00:30:10,423 --> 00:30:12,190
You should take the job.

273
00:30:14,394 --> 00:30:16,456
Go to Paris.

274
00:30:32,937 --> 00:30:33,784
Hey!

275
00:30:34,781 --> 00:30:35,774
What's the matter?

276
00:30:36,413 --> 00:30:39,098
I don't know, I'm not ready.

277
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:43,000
It's hard to concentrate after...

278
00:30:44,769 --> 00:30:47,014
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

279
00:30:47,797 --> 00:30:51,209
'Cause this is the last
practice before the championship.

280
00:30:51,329 --> 00:30:54,653
- So the last practice of your college carrier. (??)
- I know, but...

281
00:30:57,124 --> 00:30:58,449
I think you got this.

282
00:31:00,704 --> 00:31:02,398
- Really?
- Yeah.

283
00:31:03,318 --> 00:31:07,375
- You're good right there.
- Ok.

284
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:10,904
You're right.
And then the coach would kill me.

285
00:31:12,517 --> 00:31:13,541
Take it.

286
00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:16,687
Thank you.

287
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:18,414
Go.

288
00:31:20,787 --> 00:31:22,326
- Go
- Well.

289
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:25,395
You got this.

290
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:53,870
Seriously?
This is stupid!

291
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:56,324
They have not yet
placed ventilation?

292
00:31:56,431 --> 00:31:57,843
They are doing on it.

293
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:25,686
Come on, Candice, you're up.

294
00:32:36,052 --> 00:32:38,556
Come on, Candice,
you got this!

295
00:33:04,327 --> 00:33:06,298
Candice! Now!

296
00:34:21,574 --> 00:34:24,350
That's it! Everytime, Candice.

297
00:34:29,698 --> 00:34:31,492
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

298
00:34:31,526 --> 00:34:33,494
Nicely done, Candice.

299
00:34:38,433 --> 00:34:40,401
Okay, go to the bars.

300
00:34:44,539 --> 00:34:47,303
Go ahead, push!

301
00:34:50,345 --> 00:34:53,015
Here we go, Candice, go loose!

302
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:56,137
Ok, it's your turn.

303
00:34:57,576 --> 00:34:59,353
Stay focused.

304
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:52,798
Oh, shit!

305
00:35:55,413 --> 00:35:57,621
- Do not touch her!
- Call 911.

306
00:35:58,082 --> 00:35:59,518
Ah, my God!

307
00:36:20,165 --> 00:36:21,085
Peter!

308
00:36:36,276 --> 00:36:38,080
I came as soon as I heard.

309
00:36:41,686 --> 00:36:43,305
She was doing great.

310
00:36:45,919 --> 00:36:48,643
She was finishing her performance and...

311
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,441
Why ?
Why did it happen?

312
00:37:01,301 --> 00:37:05,055
- It makes no sense.
- I don't know.

313
00:37:09,045 --> 00:37:11,417
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry, Peter.

314
00:37:24,925 --> 00:37:26,876
Well, let's just go, Sam.

315
00:37:43,336 --> 00:37:46,796
- How's going?
- It's weird.

316
00:37:48,385 --> 00:37:50,042
Coming here...

317
00:37:52,514 --> 00:37:53,950
It's just so quiet.

318
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,588
You know Denis says ???

319
00:37:59,542 --> 00:38:02,602
I know, but it's depressing.

320
00:38:06,652 --> 00:38:09,339
We have get called
to get pay? (???)

321
00:38:13,793 --> 00:38:18,489
- What is he doing here?
- I think he just needs a distraction.

322
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:19,348
Yeah.

323
00:38:21,004 --> 00:38:23,481
Yeah, what a bummer about
Candice.

324
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:25,873
I think everyone was seeing that coming.

325
00:38:28,487 --> 00:38:29,297
What?

326
00:38:29,651 --> 00:38:32,400
Have not you seen the crazy shit
those gymnasts do

327
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,635
I am surprised that
does not happen again more often.

328
00:38:34,755 --> 00:38:36,572
<i> Like I wrote in the e-mail.</i>

329
00:38:36,692 --> 00:38:40,318
<i> You must disable all the keys cards
employee died.</i>

330
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:42,454
<i> instructions are included.</i>

331
00:38:42,554 --> 00:38:45,318
Why don't you send me
the Director of Human Resources?

332
00:38:46,259 --> 00:38:48,505
<i> The Director of Human Resources
is dead. </i>

333
00:38:50,238 --> 00:38:53,330
<i> - Dennis, you need to find someone out there?
- No, I got it. </i>

334
00:39:01,473 --> 00:39:03,373
Oh, Debbie!

335
00:39:08,581 --> 00:39:10,589
You were so naughty!

336
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:35,060
Norbert, my man!

337
00:39:48,523 --> 00:39:49,531
Shit!

338
00:39:56,172 --> 00:39:57,976
You shouldn't mind, buddy.

339
00:40:09,965 --> 00:40:11,288
Hey man, what are you doing up here?

340
00:40:11,408 --> 00:40:14,509
I had to leave the floor.
Roy is driving me crazy.

341
00:40:15,618 --> 00:40:18,200
So... Who wants one?

342
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,349
- Where did you get these?
- I've stole it.

343
00:40:20,361 --> 00:40:21,946
From Roy's truck.

344
00:40:22,525 --> 00:40:23,791
It's good, right?

345
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,989
- I got something better.
- Oh, nice one!

346
00:40:28,109 --> 00:40:29,523
Yeah, Count me in.

347
00:40:30,106 --> 00:40:31,725
Are you sure you wanna share that?

348
00:40:32,204 --> 00:40:35,848
If I don't I'll end up drinking alone,
which is just sad.

349
00:40:37,607 --> 00:40:40,372
Well, this stage got way more fun!

350
00:40:52,557 --> 00:40:54,525
No, I did call you.

351
00:40:55,345 --> 00:40:58,437
Of course. I just called you
right now, didn't I?

352
00:40:58,916 --> 00:41:01,717
Because I really want
to take you out again.

353
00:41:02,275 --> 00:41:05,100
Yeah, we could have a nice romantic dinner.

354
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:08,570
You know, it might be a place
outside the city. Hold up!

355
00:41:12,284 --> 00:41:14,293
You know what? I gotta go.

356
00:41:14,782 --> 00:41:17,430
No, no, no, listen ...

357
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:20,232
Hey, who's my girl, Camber?

358
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:23,223
Amber yes.
That's what I said!

359
00:41:23,343 --> 00:41:24,411
Excuse me.

360
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:33,791
Amber, I'm sorry...

361
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,282
Sorry about that.

362
00:41:36,402 --> 00:41:39,394
My sister tends to get a little
too chatty sometimes.

363
00:41:41,507 --> 00:41:46,193
So... Tell me about stress relief.

364
00:41:46,313 --> 00:41:49,329
And what it this really get me?

365
00:41:49,449 --> 00:41:52,332
This covers a session
for two different physical therapies.

366
00:41:52,452 --> 00:41:55,335
Like massage therapy.

367
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:58,322
??? massage.

368
00:41:59,682 --> 00:42:03,243
This is a family operation.
Everyone on staff is professional

369
00:42:03,363 --> 00:42:05,297
That's great! I prefer a professional.

370
00:42:05,432 --> 00:42:06,989
You know what? I kinda demand it!

371
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:12,310
I just trying to verify if this professional
experience ends uh... happy.

372
00:42:18,467 --> 00:42:22,810
- I know exactly what you need.
- Oh, I'm sure you do!

373
00:42:23,352 --> 00:42:25,706
- Follow me, please.
- I'll love to...

374
00:42:26,761 --> 00:42:28,997
Oh, slow down a little bit.

375
00:42:29,117 --> 00:42:32,393
Yeah, you have a lovely walk!

376
00:42:35,597 --> 00:42:38,280
Aahm! Yum yum!

377
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:40,271
Wait just a second.

378
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,399
This is solid.
I just wanted to be sure.

379
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:45,158
In case we get a little noisy
if you know what you think.

380
00:42:50,064 --> 00:42:52,905
Yo Buddha, slow down the rice cake.

381
00:42:57,353 --> 00:43:00,668
Just close your eyes.
Relax,

382
00:43:01,426 --> 00:43:04,224
and someone will be into serving you.

383
00:43:05,461 --> 00:43:06,565
Oh, yeah !

384
00:43:07,901 --> 00:43:18,830
Subtitle by : Harout
Timing by : 8x8 [IScrew]

385
00:43:20,284 --> 00:43:23,294
Oh, yeah ! Feels dynamite!

386
00:43:23,913 --> 00:43:27,245
No, no. You are doing it the wrong way, young lady.

387
00:43:32,117 --> 00:43:35,016
What happened to the younger version of you?

388
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:41,103
Ok, I'm sorry, do you come with subtitles?

389
00:43:41,223 --> 00:43:42,342
I can you help you, too

390
00:43:42,363 --> 00:43:43,941
You know what, I should just go here.

391
00:43:43,962 --> 00:43:45,105
Relax.

392
00:43:46,171 --> 00:43:47,672
I have no idea what that means.

393
00:43:50,866 --> 00:43:53,376
Your spine is all out of alignment...

394
00:43:53,479 --> 00:43:54,446
That's okay. I'm all right!

395
00:43:56,004 --> 00:43:58,414
What are you doing ?
- Let me help you.

396
00:43:59,297 --> 00:44:01,416
You are a little aggressive there,
don't you think?

397
00:44:01,487 --> 00:44:01,960
Breathe in...

398
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,951
- What? I do not know what to say!
- Expire out...

399
00:44:04,964 --> 00:44:06,778
No, I don't want to!

400
00:44:11,597 --> 00:44:13,497
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

401
00:44:23,907 --> 00:44:26,797
Shit!
I gotta go.

402
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:41,859
- Bye!
- See you later.

403
00:44:42,976 --> 00:44:45,863
This is the end,
So what are we toasting to?

404
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:48,412
To find new jobs.

405
00:44:48,532 --> 00:44:51,640
Because it's only a matter of time,
before they shut us down.

406
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,998
To... starting over.

407
00:44:57,421 --> 00:44:58,308
Peter.

408
00:45:03,476 --> 00:45:04,949
It just does not make sense.

409
00:45:05,592 --> 00:45:10,909
She dies doing something she's done
almost everyday for the last 15 years
of her life.

410
00:45:11,926 --> 00:45:16,692
He said she didn't want to do it,
she said she wasn't ready.

411
00:45:19,104 --> 00:45:21,060
I should have stop her.

412
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:24,472
I should have done something, I should've ...

413
00:45:24,592 --> 00:45:26,885
Peter, there wasn't anything
that you could have done.

414
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:30,495
How do you know?

415
00:45:35,985 --> 00:45:37,782
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

416
00:45:47,129 --> 00:45:50,115
Hello Agent Lock, this is Denis.

417
00:45:51,452 --> 00:45:54,609
Peter just freaked out
about something, I don't know why.

418
00:45:55,906 --> 00:45:59,591
Does that mean anything? You told me to call
If I see anything odd.

419
00:45:59,711 --> 00:46:03,936
I don't know you but thank you Denis.
Call me if you see anything strange.

420
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,075
Stranger.

421
00:46:07,017 --> 00:46:10,953
Should we have code names
for one another, do you think?

422
00:46:13,225 --> 00:46:14,134
Over now.

423
00:46:15,755 --> 00:46:18,019
All right, show me how this happened.

424
00:46:20,131 --> 00:46:22,883
- I don't think I can.
- What do you mean?

425
00:46:23,285 --> 00:46:25,872
I mean I can try a 100 times,

426
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:28,005
and never recreate exactly what happened here.

427
00:46:30,075 --> 00:46:31,940
This is some freaky shit.

428
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:50,038
Oh, it actually felt great!

429
00:46:50,521 --> 00:46:52,662
We're not done yet, fat boy.

430
00:46:52,782 --> 00:46:54,895
Ah, yeah, awesome!

431
00:47:00,447 --> 00:47:02,296
Oh, are those things even sterilized?

432
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:06,504
No, no, I'm not catching any disease,
unless I have earned them.

433
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:15,374
Wait a second,

434
00:47:15,855 --> 00:47:17,748
you understood what I said?

435
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:19,856
You speak English!

436
00:47:25,031 --> 00:47:29,934
Of course I understand you. You think I'm stupid?
I'm just pretending I don't understand.

437
00:47:30,403 --> 00:47:31,351
- You know what...

438
00:47:31,972 --> 00:47:35,033
Let's do this. 2 billion people
can't be wrong.

439
00:47:36,111 --> 00:47:38,978
Do you get it? Sure, You're Chinese.

440
00:47:44,255 --> 00:47:47,191
Oh, it's in, okay it's in!

441
00:47:48,123 --> 00:47:50,023
How many of this are you going
to put in me?

442
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:04,685
Could you grab it for me?

443
00:48:05,567 --> 00:48:06,420
Thanks.

444
00:48:06,876 --> 00:48:09,514
No phone calls
during the treatment.

445
00:48:12,449 --> 00:48:14,883
It's not very nice, you know.

446
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:18,333
Now, this needle will help you grow hair
on your head.

447
00:48:24,759 --> 00:48:28,019
Now, sleep for 30 minutes
and you'll feel real good.

448
00:48:28,097 --> 00:48:31,089
Don't touch my eyes.

449
00:48:31,833 --> 00:48:35,359
Ok, once again. I don't have no clue
what you are saying, not even a little clue.

450
00:48:35,939 --> 00:48:39,038
30 minutes. You sleep!

451
00:48:50,087 --> 00:48:51,281
Sleep.

452
00:49:21,887 --> 00:49:22,945
Fire!

453
00:49:33,558 --> 00:49:35,060
There's a fire!

454
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:40,992
Shit!

455
00:51:01,578 --> 00:51:03,016
You should come with me.

456
00:51:03,893 --> 00:51:04,951
To Paris?

457
00:51:05,028 --> 00:51:06,776
You even say it yourself!

458
00:51:06,896 --> 00:51:08,756
You're going to have to start over.

459
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,863
Start over with me.

460
00:51:13,971 --> 00:51:16,098
- How many drinks have you had?
- Enough.

461
00:51:17,041 --> 00:51:19,874
Molly, I'm serious.
You were right.

462
00:51:20,844 --> 00:51:22,835
If I don't take the job,
I'll regret it.

463
00:51:24,948 --> 00:51:26,620
But I'm not willing to lose you.

464
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:28,985
Why is it have to be one or the other?

465
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,988
I'm better when you're with me.

466
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:35,925
Guys, you're not going to believe this!

467
00:51:50,042 --> 00:51:53,068
- They said it was a freak accident.
- Raise your hand if you believe that.

468
00:51:53,879 --> 00:51:55,604
Who dies during a massage?

469
00:51:55,909 --> 00:51:56,704
Seriously?

470
00:51:56,949 --> 00:52:00,818
First Candice and now Isaac.
It can't be a coincidence.

471
00:52:01,087 --> 00:52:02,111
It's not.

472
00:52:03,989 --> 00:52:05,013
Where are you going?

473
00:52:06,092 --> 00:52:07,889
It's that creepy dude.

474
00:52:08,094 --> 00:52:09,959
Why we are following us?

475
00:52:11,998 --> 00:52:13,090
Who are you?

476
00:52:14,868 --> 00:52:17,029
You were at the cemetery
then the gym, now here.

477
00:52:19,106 --> 00:52:21,836
- What are you doing?
- My job.

478
00:52:24,144 --> 00:52:26,942
"Coroner"

479
00:52:31,952 --> 00:52:33,465
What's happening to us?

480
00:52:37,124 --> 00:52:39,854
What's make you think I know that?

481
00:52:40,026 --> 00:52:41,857
You warned us.

482
00:52:41,962 --> 00:52:44,955
At the memorial service, you said
death doesn't like to be cheated.

483
00:52:45,032 --> 00:52:47,926
- It's just that I have seen this before.

484
00:52:48,032 --> 00:52:49,126
- Seen what?

485
00:52:49,871 --> 00:52:54,898
A lucky few survivors dying one by one...

486
00:52:55,109 --> 00:52:57,977
Death comes for them all.

487
00:52:58,881 --> 00:53:01,434
You change something on that bridge.

488
00:53:01,554 --> 00:53:03,875
It's an ??? reality.

489
00:53:03,952 --> 00:53:06,079
And that rego (?) is you.

490
00:53:06,989 --> 00:53:09,957
So what, we are doomed to die ?

491
00:53:10,025 --> 00:53:14,963
Is that it? We just got our lives back
so what kind of fucked-up karma is that ?

492
00:53:15,064 --> 00:53:16,998
Are you saying that we can't stop this ?

493
00:53:17,033 --> 00:53:19,058
You were supposed
to die on that bridge.

494
00:53:20,103 --> 00:53:22,833
You are not supposed to be here.

495
00:53:23,106 --> 00:53:25,040
You should have died.

496
00:53:25,141 --> 00:53:28,838
So you let death have somebody else
in your place

497
00:53:28,912 --> 00:53:31,881
and you take his spot in
the realm of the living,

498
00:53:31,948 --> 00:53:34,940
all the days and years he have yet to live.

499
00:53:35,084 --> 00:53:37,951
And they took
your place in death.

500
00:53:39,611 --> 00:53:41,118
???

501
00:53:41,238 --> 00:53:44,510
Wait a minute, we killed someone,
we get their life ?

502
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:45,810
Is that what you are telling me ?

503
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:47,898
I don't make the rules.

504
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:53,487
I just clean up,
after the game is over.

505
00:54:05,883 --> 00:54:09,244
Maybe that's why Candice
and Isaac are dead.

506
00:54:09,954 --> 00:54:13,306
They weren't supposed to survive
and now it's coming after the rest of us.

507
00:54:15,382 --> 00:54:16,861
No, not all of us.

508
00:54:17,897 --> 00:54:20,479
- Molly made it, she didn't die.
- What?

509
00:54:22,068 --> 00:54:25,037
When I had the vision,
or premonition,

510
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:30,040
I got you across
before the bridge collapsed.

511
00:54:31,561 --> 00:54:34,234
- You survived.
- You saved her ?

512
00:54:34,947 --> 00:54:39,337
Why? Because you've decided that she deserved
to live more than the rest of us ?

513
00:54:39,457 --> 00:54:42,014
No, it's not what he's saying
I don't deserve to live more than anything else.

514
00:54:42,134 --> 00:54:44,049
But, it seems that you deserve
to live more than Candice.

515
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:46,723
- Peter, hang on!
- Look, Guys!

516
00:54:47,432 --> 00:54:49,337
You will not believe it ?

517
00:54:49,457 --> 00:54:52,974
Killing people to survive, death list, really ?

518
00:54:54,034 --> 00:54:57,253
I may not know what's going on,
but it's not what the guy says.

519
00:54:59,294 --> 00:55:01,074
What else is it then?

520
00:55:05,078 --> 00:55:06,067
Shit!

521
00:55:07,047 --> 00:55:08,911
We must go to Olivia.

522
00:55:09,031 --> 00:55:10,162
Come on.

523
00:55:14,706 --> 00:55:21,008
<i>It's been a long time since your last visit.
What made you come today?</i>

524
00:55:23,565 --> 00:55:26,338
A lot is going on in my life.

525
00:55:26,458 --> 00:55:29,330
It's just than I don't want to miss anything.

526
00:55:29,971 --> 00:55:31,649
You know, nothing important.

527
00:55:31,769 --> 00:55:33,181
Same reason that I ??? myself.

528
00:55:33,301 --> 00:55:35,908
Come on, let's get you started.

529
00:55:44,019 --> 00:55:47,363
Yeah that's the first step.
You are not going to need those again.

530
00:55:50,125 --> 00:55:52,856
Here we are. Come on in.

531
00:56:03,974 --> 00:56:05,942
What are these?

532
00:56:06,943 --> 00:56:09,969
Oh, it's just for some younger patients.

533
00:56:11,014 --> 00:56:13,766
And, sometimes the older ones too.

534
00:56:25,062 --> 00:56:27,895
- What's that?
- Relax.

535
00:56:28,546 --> 00:56:30,679
It looks a lot worse than what it really is.

536
00:56:31,902 --> 00:56:34,029
I'm gently going to position your head...

537
00:56:37,141 --> 00:56:40,872
I want you to tell me
when this feels snug.

538
00:56:41,979 --> 00:56:43,913
I can't move my head.

539
00:56:43,981 --> 00:56:46,006
Perfect. Just what we want.

540
00:56:48,442 --> 00:56:49,875
Here we go.

541
00:56:50,121 --> 00:56:52,361
Ok, now comes the fun part.

542
00:56:53,426 --> 00:56:58,810
With these drops, you will feel
a little numbness in your eye.

543
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:00,431
Which is a good thing.

544
00:57:16,229 --> 00:57:17,907
Deep Breathe.

545
00:57:22,389 --> 00:57:23,356
Relax.

546
00:57:30,964 --> 00:57:32,124
Very good.

547
00:57:38,105 --> 00:57:39,902
Good girl!

548
00:57:50,084 --> 00:57:51,915
That's not so bad, is it?

549
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:06,341
Looks good!

550
00:58:14,976 --> 00:58:16,944
- What was that?
- Relax, Olivia.

551
00:58:17,912 --> 00:58:19,904
I'm just entering some data.

552
00:58:23,953 --> 00:58:25,045
Dotty.

553
00:58:28,892 --> 00:58:32,719
My assistant gave me an incomplete
file. I'll Be right back.

554
00:58:34,812 --> 00:58:36,202
Hold on! You're leaving?

555
00:59:07,131 --> 00:59:09,099
Is that supposed to be happening?

556
00:59:25,917 --> 00:59:27,401
"Emergency Stop"

557
00:59:50,944 --> 00:59:51,968
Help! Help!

558
01:00:04,024 --> 01:00:06,891
- Olivia Castle, where is she?
- She may be in danger!

559
01:00:06,961 --> 01:00:09,930
No, she's fine.
We do those kind of procedures all the time.

560
01:00:17,071 --> 01:00:18,936
Help me!

561
01:00:19,661 --> 01:00:21,197
Help me!

562
01:00:46,134 --> 01:00:47,158
Sam...

563
01:00:49,512 --> 01:00:53,720
- Can you stay with me for the night please?
- Of course.

564
01:00:59,981 --> 01:01:04,878
5 different systems had to go wrong for
that laser to fail so spectacularly, 5 !

565
01:01:05,989 --> 01:01:07,889
What do you want from us?

566
01:01:07,924 --> 01:01:09,915
I want to tell me what you think is going on.

567
01:01:10,027 --> 01:01:12,776
Two deaths, ok, all right, that's a coincidence.

568
01:01:12,896 --> 01:01:14,044
Three?

569
01:01:14,164 --> 01:01:15,927
It's a pattern.

570
01:01:31,014 --> 01:01:33,692
I know you two didn't do this.

571
01:01:37,121 --> 01:01:39,112
But I think you know something.

572
01:01:42,026 --> 01:01:43,323
What is it?

573
01:01:45,129 --> 01:01:46,960
We don't know anything.

574
01:01:48,099 --> 01:01:49,930
Take a guess.

575
01:01:56,174 --> 01:02:00,110
We think we weren't suppose
to survive on that bridge.

576
01:02:01,879 --> 01:02:02,903
What?

577
01:02:03,147 --> 01:02:06,981
And now, something is trying to
set it right.

578
01:02:08,987 --> 01:02:10,045
Something?

579
01:02:12,157 --> 01:02:14,091
that's all you got?

580
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:20,619
Right now, yeah. But, if you come over
with a better explanation, let us now.

581
01:02:24,070 --> 01:02:25,059
Thank you.

582
01:02:45,984 --> 01:02:47,463
You're up early.

583
01:02:50,097 --> 01:02:53,538
I don't know, I could not sleep,
I'm just thinking about the bridge.

584
01:02:58,072 --> 01:02:59,004
Sam...

585
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:01,589
You can't do this to yourself.

586
01:03:01,939 --> 01:03:04,339
No, I was thinking of the premonition.

587
01:03:06,176 --> 01:03:10,073
We all got off the bus, but
the ground gave away and Candice fell.

588
01:03:11,086 --> 01:03:12,774
And the bus flipped over

589
01:03:14,129 --> 01:03:17,373
and Isaac, he never got off the bus,
he went with it.

590
01:03:17,493 --> 01:03:21,886
- Where are you getting at?
- I know it sounds strange.

591
01:03:22,931 --> 01:03:25,564
Look, I know that I helped you
to cross.

592
01:03:26,168 --> 01:03:29,001
Then I reached back to Olivia.

593
01:03:29,772 --> 01:03:32,359
But she didn't make it, she fell.

594
01:03:34,534 --> 01:03:35,501
So?

595
01:03:36,751 --> 01:03:38,343
The first was Candice,

596
01:03:40,882 --> 01:03:41,871
Then Isaac

597
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:44,168
and then Olivia.

598
01:03:45,122 --> 01:03:47,022
They are dying, in that order.

599
01:03:48,091 --> 01:03:50,025
Who dies after Olivia?

600
01:03:58,068 --> 01:03:59,160
"Fuck you"

601
01:04:00,468 --> 01:04:21,960
Subtitle by : Harout
Timing by : 8x8 [IScrew]

602
01:04:25,964 --> 01:04:28,125
You could come up, Roy please?

603
01:04:29,033 --> 01:04:31,092
Oh oh Roy that's the boss, you are in trouble Roy.

604
01:04:47,987 --> 01:04:50,114
Okay school boy what do want to talk me about?

605
01:04:50,234 --> 01:04:52,881
- About your time card.
- Yeah, let's talk about the time card.

606
01:04:52,958 --> 01:04:55,775
You have cut my hours,
which means that you have cut my pay.

607
01:04:55,895 --> 01:04:59,845
I removed everyone's hours, okay ? The company has
reduced by 50 percent, the hours in total.

608
01:04:59,965 --> 01:05:04,180
My domain can't be
working at 50 percent.

609
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:05,063
Roy.

610
01:05:05,138 --> 01:05:08,107
I want to see
if you work at 50 percent.

611
01:05:08,174 --> 01:05:10,972
- We gotta go man!
- I'm not going anywhere!

612
01:05:11,044 --> 01:05:12,944
We gotta to move!

613
01:05:13,013 --> 01:05:14,998
We gotta to move now!

614
01:05:24,992 --> 01:05:26,516
Roy? You okay down there?

615
01:05:31,580 --> 01:05:33,287
- Hey Denis.
- Hey.

616
01:05:35,136 --> 01:05:38,786
- They are closing us down.
- They are shutting down the plan.

617
01:05:38,906 --> 01:05:40,996
Not the plan, just us.

618
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:44,101
Just sales administration.
Can you believe it, us?

619
01:05:45,012 --> 01:05:48,897
Usually, it's the factor guys
that usually get laid off.
Not us, We're supposed to be safe.

620
01:05:49,017 --> 01:05:51,110
Denis, we have bigger problems.

621
01:05:52,087 --> 01:05:54,112
Olivia and Isaac are dead.

622
01:05:55,023 --> 01:05:59,146
- Who's Isaac?
- Isaac, textport. (???)

623
01:06:00,128 --> 01:06:03,029
- Wasn't he dead already?
- No, Denis.

624
01:06:04,166 --> 01:06:08,267
It's going to happen to us too if
we don't do something about it.

625
01:06:09,938 --> 01:06:13,101
I understand. It's called "survivor guilt."

626
01:06:13,175 --> 01:06:16,975
No, guilt doesn't kill you !

627
01:06:17,012 --> 01:06:19,231
Obviously, you've never
met my in-laws.

628
01:06:19,351 --> 01:06:22,966
I'm not fucking around, Denis.
Anyone could be next!

629
01:06:23,086 --> 01:06:25,885
It could be you, understand?

630
01:06:26,023 --> 01:06:29,015
- Nobody's safe!
- What are you talking about?

631
01:06:31,485 --> 01:06:34,056
We weren't supposed to survived
when that bridge collapsed.

632
01:06:34,131 --> 01:06:37,032
And so now it's kill or be killed.

633
01:06:37,683 --> 01:06:39,190
You get that, Denis?

634
01:06:41,038 --> 01:06:43,029
Whatever, I warned you.

635
01:06:43,173 --> 01:06:45,038
Do whatever you want to do.

636
01:06:49,013 --> 01:06:50,037
I will.

637
01:06:55,186 --> 01:06:57,916
Agent Lock, it's Denis.

638
01:06:58,089 --> 01:07:01,837
Pete just came in here
and he has just completely lost it!

639
01:07:01,957 --> 01:07:04,339
He yells about "kill or be killed"!

640
01:07:04,842 --> 01:07:07,157
Oh, yeah, it definitely sounds
like a threat.

641
01:07:24,556 --> 01:07:29,077
- What happened ?
- I don't know. It just happened so fast !

642
01:07:30,990 --> 01:07:33,925
- You're okay ?
- Are you hurt ?

643
01:07:34,093 --> 01:07:35,389
I'm good.

644
01:07:37,029 --> 01:07:38,929
- Did you kill him?
- What?

645
01:07:39,932 --> 01:07:41,752
No, no, I just...

646
01:07:42,101 --> 01:07:45,325
No, he got in the way and...

647
01:07:45,445 --> 01:07:47,722
No, you did, didn't you ?
You saw it coming

648
01:07:47,842 --> 01:07:48,989
and then you took his live.

649
01:07:49,109 --> 01:07:51,907
- You put him in the way!
- I don't really do anything!

650
01:07:52,112 --> 01:07:54,013
That's true ? Did you or didn't you?

651
01:07:54,082 --> 01:07:56,107
- Peter, calm down!
- Did you or didn't you ?

652
01:07:59,187 --> 01:08:01,052
Did you or didn't you ?

653
01:08:02,325 --> 01:08:05,481
Yes, I think I did.

654
01:08:06,342 --> 01:08:07,423
I killed him.

655
01:08:08,652 --> 01:08:15,094
So if the theory works then
you traded his place so he had your dead
and you'll have his. (???)

656
01:08:16,005 --> 01:08:17,840
How we know for sure?

657
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:20,598
I think there is an order for these deaths.

658
01:08:20,718 --> 01:08:23,909
The same order as the deaths of the bridge.

659
01:08:24,145 --> 01:08:25,977
Then who will be next?

660
01:08:27,983 --> 01:08:30,485
Someone wants me to tell
what the hell is going on?

661
01:08:30,605 --> 01:08:33,659
- Who's next?
- Who's what?

662
01:08:37,159 --> 01:08:39,992
Denis! It was Denis!

663
01:08:40,556 --> 01:08:42,894
No shit!!

664
01:08:48,967 --> 01:08:53,097
Why are you fighting me on this? You're
not going seriously to work, are you?

665
01:08:53,175 --> 01:08:54,938
Molly...

666
01:08:55,110 --> 01:08:57,875
Isaac died on a massage table!

667
01:08:58,047 --> 01:09:01,175
- Death is going to come for me, I don't think it matters where I am.
- But you have to do something!

668
01:09:03,019 --> 01:09:05,988
- What? Kill someone so I can live?
- No, of course not.

669
01:09:06,189 --> 01:09:09,091
- We'll just have to figure something else out.
- I've figured it out.

670
01:09:10,961 --> 01:09:13,088
Something saved me on the bridge.

671
01:09:14,064 --> 01:09:16,032
Maybe he doesn't want me to die.

672
01:09:18,068 --> 01:09:19,126
Maybe.

673
01:09:20,104 --> 01:09:22,009
We can't live our lives
in fear, Molly.

674
01:09:25,142 --> 01:09:29,978
If something happens tomorrow or 15 years from now,
whatever as soon as we are together.

675
01:09:33,018 --> 01:09:34,918
I'll be okay.

676
01:09:37,792 --> 01:09:42,889
I want you to come by after my shift,
and I'll make a nice late dinner.

677
01:09:50,866 --> 01:09:52,060
Give me this.

678
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:26,962
Samuel, go to work! Come on, come on!

679
01:11:04,972 --> 01:11:07,105
Could have been ugly, huh?

680
01:11:59,103 --> 01:12:01,037
Just met your girlfriend. (?)

681
01:12:01,866 --> 01:12:05,000
Are you sure it's okay if I make
her a dinner or something? (?)

682
01:12:06,011 --> 01:12:08,962
- Make sure you leave no traces. (?)
- I will, of course, thank you.

683
01:12:12,084 --> 01:12:14,052
- Chef...
- Yes.

684
01:12:14,666 --> 01:12:19,705
Your partnership, if the offer still stands

685
01:12:19,806 --> 01:12:21,489
I'd like to take it.

686
01:12:22,194 --> 01:12:23,957
It's yours.

687
01:12:39,045 --> 01:12:40,137
OK, no more suspense.

688
01:12:41,777 --> 01:12:43,739
What you've been waiting for.

689
01:12:47,153 --> 01:12:48,984
You made this okay? (??)

690
01:12:49,088 --> 01:12:51,181
Yeah sure, you want me to...
You don't want me to...

691
01:12:52,959 --> 01:12:54,574
How's your French?

692
01:12:54,994 --> 01:12:56,086
Terrible.

693
01:12:56,963 --> 01:12:59,607
Good! We can be terrible together.

694
01:13:00,933 --> 01:13:01,957
Why ?

695
01:13:02,035 --> 01:13:04,128
- I accepted the internship.
- What?

696
01:13:05,104 --> 01:13:07,004
Sam that's amazing!

697
01:13:11,112 --> 01:13:12,977
I'm so proud of you!

698
01:13:30,098 --> 01:13:31,087
Peter...

699
01:13:35,003 --> 01:13:37,972
Are you okay? You look a little upset.

700
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:40,907
Yeah, yeah.
Just rough couple days.

701
01:13:42,078 --> 01:13:45,103
Yeah, to everyone.

702
01:13:45,181 --> 01:13:47,979
For some, more than others.

703
01:13:48,984 --> 01:13:50,918
Do you mind if I come in?

704
01:13:51,087 --> 01:13:52,145
Of course, come in.

705
01:13:58,194 --> 01:13:59,923
Have a seat.

706
01:14:00,096 --> 01:14:01,085
Thanks.

707
01:14:06,969 --> 01:14:08,129
Hey, Peter.

708
01:14:09,038 --> 01:14:10,096
Hi...

709
01:14:25,956 --> 01:14:29,084
Can I get you anything to eat?
I can make some pasta.

710
01:14:29,192 --> 01:14:31,923
No, I'm good, thank you.

711
01:14:34,999 --> 01:14:36,990
I'm sorry, I just thought...

712
01:14:37,101 --> 01:14:40,036
Peter, it's good that you are here
you shouldn't be alone right now.

713
01:14:40,171 --> 01:14:42,106
I'm surprised to be here at all.

714
01:14:44,076 --> 01:14:45,976
To be still alive I mean.

715
01:14:48,113 --> 01:14:50,104
I'm next on the list, right?

716
01:14:50,182 --> 01:14:52,082
It's me and then you, right?

717
01:14:56,121 --> 01:14:58,885
I was up
last night thinking about,

718
01:15:01,093 --> 01:15:02,993
if I can really do it.

719
01:15:03,929 --> 01:15:06,618
- Do what?
- Take someone else's life.

720
01:15:07,166 --> 01:15:09,134
I could actually kill some stranger.

721
01:15:09,968 --> 01:15:12,937
And replace their life with my own.

722
01:15:13,973 --> 01:15:15,998
And I thought about it and uh...

723
01:15:16,910 --> 01:15:20,073
and I convinced myself that I could.

724
01:15:23,950 --> 01:15:25,815
So I went on a walk.

725
01:15:26,986 --> 01:15:31,644
Nowhere in particular, but every couple of minutes
an opportunity will just presented itself,

726
01:15:32,192 --> 01:15:34,023
like ???.

727
01:15:35,995 --> 01:15:38,987
I just grab somebody and pull him in an alley...

728
01:15:39,165 --> 01:15:42,157
Or push someone
in front of a car.

729
01:15:50,946 --> 01:15:52,004
What did you do?

730
01:16:00,088 --> 01:16:01,988
- Did you...?
- No, I didn't.

731
01:16:07,162 --> 01:16:11,030
I realized that I couldn't kill
somebody that didn't deserve to die.

732
01:16:14,936 --> 01:16:17,842
I thought about Candice
and I though "wait a minute...".

733
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:21,968
Candice didn't deserve to die.

734
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,139
Olivia didn't, Dennis didn't.

735
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:29,076
I don't.

736
01:16:31,087 --> 01:16:32,111
Do I?

737
01:16:33,055 --> 01:16:34,989
No, of course you don't.

738
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:39,118
Well,

739
01:16:40,963 --> 01:16:44,126
None of us deserves to die,

740
01:16:45,067 --> 01:16:48,196
then why you deserve to live, Molly?

741
01:16:52,761 --> 01:16:56,287
You say it yourself, you don't.

742
01:17:01,952 --> 01:17:03,010
Let's go!

743
01:17:04,955 --> 01:17:07,947
I heard the shotfire.
Requesting backup.

744
01:17:09,646 --> 01:17:11,996
Hide. Hide where you can.

745
01:17:15,166 --> 01:17:17,031
Not done yet, Sam.

746
01:17:18,694 --> 01:17:20,127
Where is she?

747
01:17:23,042 --> 01:17:24,066
Where is she?

748
01:17:24,143 --> 01:17:26,111
I'm not gotta hurt her, Peter!

749
01:17:26,231 --> 01:17:30,517
- You'll have to kill me first.
- This doesn't do me any good.

750
01:17:30,637 --> 01:17:34,976
- Death wants you too!
- This is crazy, Peter! Don't do this!

751
01:17:36,022 --> 01:17:38,610
Just think... For a minute...
All right?

752
01:17:39,299 --> 01:17:41,152
You are not a killer!

753
01:17:42,113 --> 01:17:44,701
I don't want to kill anybody, Sam.

754
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:48,893
But I don't want to die either!

755
01:17:55,034 --> 01:17:57,082
It's not your time yet.

756
01:18:06,477 --> 01:18:08,240
Don't worry, Molly.

757
01:18:10,695 --> 01:18:12,055
I didn't kill him.

758
01:18:14,695 --> 01:18:18,235
But I don't need to...
Molly, because...

759
01:18:19,588 --> 01:18:22,970
because death is going to do that for me.

760
01:18:23,926 --> 01:18:25,689
It doesn't mean I can't help.

761
01:19:11,673 --> 01:19:12,869
Are you okay?

762
01:19:12,989 --> 01:19:15,281
- What's going on?
- It's Peter. He has a gun!

763
01:19:20,129 --> 01:19:21,187
Oh, my God!

764
01:19:25,969 --> 01:19:27,061
You killed him!

765
01:19:33,977 --> 01:19:35,251
It's Sam's turn.

766
01:19:41,952 --> 01:19:47,651
Peter, just go.
You have your life, you're safe now.

767
01:19:48,703 --> 01:19:49,955
Please.

768
01:19:50,597 --> 01:19:51,889
Sorry, Molly.

769
01:19:54,199 --> 01:19:57,931
You've just witnessed
murder of a federal agent.

770
01:20:00,005 --> 01:20:05,095
I'm not going to spend the life that I
just earned ... in prison.

771
01:20:15,187 --> 01:20:17,052
Molly, go get help!

772
01:21:26,161 --> 01:21:28,026
Tell Candice,

773
01:21:28,196 --> 01:21:29,993
I love her.

774
01:21:30,066 --> 01:21:31,090
Peter!

775
01:21:57,160 --> 01:21:59,993
He's gone. You killed him!

776
01:22:02,066 --> 01:22:04,091
Does that mean I get Block's life?

777
01:22:08,072 --> 01:22:08,755
Yeah.

778
01:22:09,982 --> 01:22:11,205
Yes, I do.

779
01:22:28,092 --> 01:22:30,190
Do you mind if I take the window seat?

780
01:22:30,310 --> 01:22:34,768
Do you really want me to seat here...
I'm about twice your size!

781
01:22:41,107 --> 01:22:44,042
- Come on, if you dare!
- Get off the plane!

782
01:22:52,184 --> 01:22:55,608
- What's that about?
- I have no idea.

783
01:22:56,222 --> 01:23:00,078
<i> "Ladies and gentlemen, fasten
your seatbelts, please ..."</i>

784
01:23:05,583 --> 01:23:06,550
Ready to go.

785
01:23:53,981 --> 01:23:55,960
Sir.

786
01:24:00,291 --> 01:24:05,312
<i>Excuse me,
those passengers who got off the plane,
what was that all about ?</i>

787
01:24:05,432 --> 01:24:08,156
<i>He had a panic attack and wanted to board off the plane.</i>

788
01:24:08,231 --> 01:24:10,995
<i>He said he had some kind of a vision...</i>

789
01:24:11,101 --> 01:24:12,193
No!

790
01:24:14,070 --> 01:24:15,162
Oh, my God!

791
01:24:20,725 --> 01:24:21,493
Sam!

792
01:24:50,141 --> 01:24:51,972
I got you!

793
01:24:52,977 --> 01:24:54,035
Sam!

794
01:24:54,547 --> 01:24:56,395
Molly, hold on!

795
01:25:26,965 --> 01:25:30,918
I appreciate that you came, Nathan.
Roy wasn't the easiest guy to work with.

796
01:25:33,593 --> 01:25:36,011
I still can't believe he's gone.

797
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:40,192
I think it was for the best.

798
01:25:41,027 --> 01:25:42,154
What do you mean?

799
01:25:42,963 --> 01:25:47,581
Company got an autopsy for insurance purposes.
Turns out that Roy had bad blood vessel in his brain,

800
01:25:47,701 --> 01:25:51,103
so big, that it was about to burst
and he'll be died any day now.

801
01:25:54,333 --> 01:25:55,954
Any day?

802
01:25:57,010 --> 01:25:59,382
Life's a bitch!

803
01:26:04,886 --> 01:26:24,601
