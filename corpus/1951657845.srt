00:00:05,986--> 00:00:08,545
Hello Nicholas.
- Hello Sergeant.


2
00:00:08,999--> 00:00:12,517
How's the hand?
- Still a bit stiff.

3
00:00:12,774--> 00:00:15,588
It can get awfully scary out there.
I am surprised that you hadn't stepped up sooner 

4
00:00:15,774--> 00:00:20,450
for a nice desk job, that's what i do.
- I prefer that my office is out in the street.

5
00:00:20,672--> 00:00:25,994
Indeed you do. Your  arrest record is 
400% higher than any other officer.
 

6
00:00:27,178--> 00:00:32,185
Which is why it's high time that such
skills were put to better use.

7
00:00:33,465--> 00:00:36,389
We are making you Sergeant.
- I see.

8
00:00:36,755--> 00:00:39,462
In Sandford, Gloucesterchire.
- In where,sorry?

9
00:00:39,645--> 00:00:42,987
In Sandford, Gloucesterchire.
- That is in the country.

10
00:00:43,133--> 00:00:44,904
Yes,perfect.

11
00:00:45,344--> 00:00:47,245
Isn't there a sergeant's 
position, here in London?


12
00:00:47,392--> 00:00:49,659
No.
- Can I remain here as a PC?

13
00:00:49,772--> 00:00:51,893
No.
- Do I have any choice in this?

14
00:00:52,039--> 00:00:53,761
No.

15
00:00:54,198--> 00:00:58,218
Sergeant, I kind of like it here.
- Well you've always wanted to transfer to the country.

16
00:00:58,367--> 00:01:01,372
In 20 years or so ,yes..
- Well I knew.

17
00:01:01,556--> 00:01:04,992
I don't remember telling you that.
- Yes you did, you said:

18
00:01:05,738--> 00:01:09,502
I'd like to settle down in
the country sometime Janine.

19
00:01:09,724--> 00:01:12,948
I'd like to talk to the Inspector.
- You can speak to the inspector, but

20
00:01:13,097--> 00:01:16,642
I can promise you he will tell you
exactly the same thing as I have.

21
00:01:18,215--> 00:01:21,942
Hello Nicholas. How's the hand?
- It's still a bit stiff.

22
00:01:22,126--> 00:01:24,357
And how are things at home?
- I am sorry sir?

23
00:01:24,505--> 00:01:27,173
How's Janine?

24
00:01:27,736--> 00:01:29,383
We are no longer together Sir

25
00:01:29,639--> 00:01:32,563
Well,then where are you living?
- He is  staying in the section house Sir.

26
00:01:32,711--> 00:01:35,307
With the recruits?
- Yes, he is living out of cardboardboxes.

27
00:01:35,491--> 00:01:37,539
Well then you are packed already.

28
00:01:37,687--> 00:01:40,366
Nicholas we are offering a smashing 
position, with a delightful cottage and a...

29
00:01:40,515--> 00:01:45,193
lovely little place that I think has
won village of the year I don't know how many times.

30
00:01:45,559--> 00:01:47,387
It'll be good for you.

31
00:01:47,573--> 00:01:51,154
I don't really know what to say.
- Yes?

32
00:01:51,376--> 00:01:53,240
Yes,thank you.

33
00:01:55,397--> 00:01:59,124
No, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to..
- You wanna take this higher?

34
00:01:59,273--> 00:02:00,488
Yes, yes I do.

35
00:02:00,681--> 00:02:02,031
You want me to bother the 
Chief Inspector for this?

36
00:02:02,181--> 00:02:03,253
Yes.

37
00:02:03,512--> 00:02:06,143
You want me to get the Chief Inspector 
to come all the way down here?

38
00:02:06,365--> 00:02:08,850
Yes I do.
-Well ok.

39
00:02:09,874--> 00:02:13,858
Keneth.
- Hello Nicholas. How's the hand?

40
00:02:14,079--> 00:02:16,090
Still a bit stiff.
- Cief Inspector 

41
00:02:16,274--> 00:02:17,314
Please sit.

42
00:02:17,462--> 00:02:21,628
Now, I know what you're going to say,
but the fact is you've been making us  

43
00:02:21,814--> 00:02:23,970
all look bad.
- I am sorry Sir?

44
00:02:24,154--> 00:02:28,248
Of course we all appreciate  your
efforts,but you've been wrong letting sides down.

45
00:02:28,434--> 00:02:32,380
It's all about being a team player,Nicholas.
- You can't be the Sheriff of London.

46
00:02:32,567--> 00:02:36,001
If we let you carry on running around in
town,you'll continue to be exceptional.

47
00:02:36,163--> 00:02:40,147
And we can't have that.You'll
put us all out of our job.

48
00:02:41,061--> 00:02:45,015
With respect Sir,you can't just
make people disappear.

49
00:02:45,165--> 00:02:48,782
Yes I can. I am the Chief Inspector.

50
00:02:48,967--> 00:02:52,768
well, how ever you spin this,there's 
one thing you haven't taken into account.

51
00:02:53,426--> 00:02:56,467
And that what the team is 
gonna make of this.

52
00:03:11,454--> 00:03:13,318
Hello!
- Jenine, It's me.

53
00:03:13,541--> 00:03:17,999
I know. I am at work.
-I know. I am outside.

54
00:03:19,499--> 00:03:24,403
What's the situation?
- You know the situation.We've been over this.

55
00:03:24,559--> 00:03:27,300
No, I mean here.
- Two people involved, the scene

56
00:03:27,486--> 00:03:31,542
might have been a struggle, a complete mess.
- Do you want to talk to me out here?

57
00:03:31,692--> 00:03:34,578
Nicholas,what do you want?
- Well, I have something important to tell you,

58
00:03:34,726--> 00:03:37,869
and I didn't want to do it over the phone.

59
00:03:39,552--> 00:03:41,902
Janine, I've been transferred.
I'm moving away for a while.

60
00:03:42,160--> 00:03:44,390
I am not Jenine.

61
00:03:44,946--> 00:03:47,288
Janine,I've been transferred.
I'm moving away for a while.

62
00:03:47,436--> 00:03:49,703
I know, Bob told me.

63
00:03:50,546--> 00:03:52,812
Well, I wanted to tell you in person.

64
00:03:52,995--> 00:03:56,943 
There is no reason we can't    each other.
It's not that long ago we were 
talking about getting married.

65
00:03:57,089--> 00:03:59,725
yes, but you were already
married with the Force,weren't you?

66
00:03:59,917--> 00:04:02,037
we are actually supposed 
to call it the service now,



67
00:04:02,260--> 00:04:04,379
official vocab guideline stated
that force is too agressive.


68
00:04:04,527--> 00:04:07,451
See? I's only ever about the job,
it's all you care about.

69
00:04:07,709--> 00:04:08,843
That's not true.

70
00:04:08,991--> 00:04:11,520
No, you're right.Do 
have that  plant.

71
00:04:11,706--> 00:04:15,395
It is Japanese Peace Lilly.
- You just can't switch off Nicholas.

72
00:04:16,128--> 00:04:21,158
And until you find a person you
care abut more than your job, 
you never will.

73
00:04:22,395--> 00:04:25,427
besides, you were the one that
suggested we take a break. 

74
00:04:25,575--> 00:04:27,294
Yes, well

75
00:04:27,515--> 00:04:30,549
guilty people are 
for make the first move.
  

76
00:04:30,697--> 00:04:34,205
Actually,there is something I need to tell you.
- You are seeing someone else.

77
00:04:34,390--> 00:04:36,182
Yeah. How did you...?
- Is it Bob?

78
00:04:36,366--> 00:04:40,464
No. Does Bob look like
the kind of person I go out with? 


79
00:04:40,650--> 00:04:42,952
It's Dave.Hello there! 

80
00:04:44,903--> 00:04:47,462

81
00:04:47,683--> 00:04:49,402
Oh Nicholas.

82
00:04:49,603--> 00:04:53,292
You do realize that window
is broken from the inside.

83
00:04:57,035--> 00:05:01,164
Hello there Nicholas. Frank Butterman
here. Your new Inspector.

84
00:05:01,313--> 00:05:04,457
I just call with details
of your accommodation.

You've got your lovely little 
cottage on Spencerhill.Look 
forward to meeting you along.Cheerio.

86

89
00:06:08,524--> 00:06:11,192
I was hoping to check in.

90
00:06:11,377--> 00:06:15,652
Check in? But you've
always been here.

91
00:06:15,802--> 00:06:18,141

00:13:22,011--> 00:13:23,401
He's gone.

165
00:13:23,585--> 00:13:26,327
Oh my god. Who's gone?

166
00:13:29,252--> 00:13:31,847
Why are you dressed like a 
police officer?

167
00:13:31,996--> 00:13:34,407
Because I am one.

168
00:13:34,592--> 00:13:37,119
Ah,Sergeant Angel.At last. Frank Butterman.

169
00:13:38,070--> 00:13:41,761
I see you already met my boy.
- yes.

170
00:13:43,115--> 00:13:46,551
Do forgive me I am something 
of a wild-west nut.


171
00:13:46,771--> 00:13:50,939
Speaking of which,there were 
a few outlaws you rounded up last night 

172
00:13:51,124--> 00:13:52,585
Thank you Sir.

173
00:13:52,822--> 00:13:58,386
I admire your enthusiasm, far be it from
me to stamp on  your flare,
but this isn't London. Oh yes please.

174
00:14:00,606--> 00:14:04,846
With respect sir,geographical location
shouldn't factor in the application of the law.

175
00:14:05,031--> 00:14:06,164
No thank's.

176
00:14:06,312--> 00:14:10,150
statistically Sandford is the
safest village in the country.

177
00:14:10,408--> 00:14:14,829
But that doesn't mean that it requires anything
less than a careful and considerate approach.

178
00:14:15,015--> 00:14:18,159
There is a reason we accomodate a
few of the younglings in the pub.

179
00:14:18,342--> 00:14:21,522
The greater good.
- The greater good,precisely.

180
00:14:21,707--> 00:14:26,678
Your predecessor assumed that rural
policing was easy.

181
00:14:26,936--> 00:14:32,258
ended up having a nervous break-down.And 
Sergeant Popwell was an exceptional officer.
truly exepctional.

182
00:14:33,831--> 00:14:36,864
And he had one thing yopou haven't got.
- What's that Sir?

183
00:14:37,049--> 00:14:41,691
A great big bushy beard.Come on.
Let's have a nosey around.

184
00:14:43,342--> 00:14:44,944
locker room.

185
00:14:46,188--> 00:14:48,710
Riot room.

186
00:14:50,173--> 00:14:51,854
Evidenc room.

187
00:14:54,563--> 00:14:58,217
Now how 'bout a trip to the Andies?

188
00:14:58,474--> 00:15:02,057
Detective Sergeant Wainright
and Detective Constable Cockram.

189
00:15:03,774--> 00:15:05,638
Don't get up.

190
00:15:06,867--> 00:15:09,090
I you're wondering why
we call them Andies.

191
00:15:09,276--> 00:15:12,482
Both called Andrew?
- They said that you were good.

192
00:15:12,631--> 00:15:15,263
Also because (i have no idea)
them up and struggles in it,Dad. 

193
00:15:17,383--> 00:15:18,809
Thank you,Donnie.

194
00:15:19,695--> 00:15:23,934
swearbox. All proceeds to the
church roof.

195
00:15:24,156--> 00:15:26,897
And this is ,where it all happens.

196
00:15:28,542--> 00:15:33,220
That is the Sergeant Tony
Fisher, PC Walt Walker,

197
00:15:33,442--> 00:15:35,525
And that is a Saxon.

198
00:15:35,710--> 00:15:40,445
And this is one Doris Fletcher.
- She's our only policewoman.

199
00:15:40,629--> 00:15:43,299
She is not a policewoman.
- Yes she is, I've seen her bra.

200
00:15:43,483--> 00:15:45,786
she is a police officer,
being a  woman has nothing to do with it.
201
00:15:45,934--> 00:15:47,637
A hardy comes in handy every so often

202
00:15:47,821--> 00:15:51,989
I could have given you the tour. I've
been around the station a few times.

203
00:15:52,283--> 00:15:54,293
And what's upstairs?

204
00:15:55,353--> 00:15:57,876
well,well,well I see we have visitors.

205
00:15:58,032--> 00:16:00,518
Nicholas, this is Tom Weaver.

206
00:16:00,702--> 00:16:05,234
Civilian liaison for the neighborhood watch.
 You'll find that we run

207
00:16:05,382--> 00:16:07,211
a very tight shift here.

208
00:16:08,710--> 00:16:14,045
From this command center, I can
see what the whole village is up to.

209
00:16:15,071--> 00:16:19,193
I must say I was rather admiring your hardy work last night,
it's a pity  

210
00:16:19,401--> 00:16:23,544
you couldn't do the same to those bloody hoodies,
Hanging around loitering, 

211
00:16:23,729--> 00:16:26,251
Actually I noticed some 
minor graffiti on the fountain.

212
00:16:26,435--> 00:16:28,789
Graffiti? They gotta be dealt
with Frank.

213
00:16:28,945--> 00:16:31,248
They're nippers Tom, they will come around.

214
00:16:31,506--> 00:16:35,796
Which reminds me, our old friend
the living statue was here Saturday.

215
00:16:35,989--> 00:16:40,996
11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock.

216
00:16:41,254--> 00:16:46,334
If we don't come down hard on these clowns, 
we are gonna be up to our balls in jugglers.

217
00:16:46,490--> 00:16:48,866
we'll get right on to it Tom.

218
00:16:50,489--> 00:16:55,605
We like to let them think they run the place.
- Well, tha's that. Unless there's anything 
you're unclear about.

219
00:16:57,089--> 00:17:00,597
Yes Sir. Why is everybody 
eating chocolate cake?

220
00:17:00,782--> 00:17:05,387
The black porisgatto??? is on Donnie,
his punishment for his little indiscretion.

221
00:17:05,586--> 00:17:09,278
Sir, I don't think driving under the influence,
can be called  a little indiscretion.

222
00:17:09,536--> 00:17:13,044
No.The gatto is for misplacing
his helmet the other week.

223
00:17:13,229--> 00:17:17,249
Last nights incident will require
something rather more serious.
- Good.

224
00:17:17,433--> 00:17:20,430
Do you like ice cream?
- I'm sorry sir, I don't follow.

225
00:17:20,980--> 00:17:25,096
Let's just say we won't be short
of junky-munky for the next month.


226
00:17:25,353--> 00:17:26,743
God.

227
00:17:27,118--> 00:17:31,284
Now, since it's your first day and it's
11:30, I would say that's lunch.

228
00:17:36,766--> 00:17:40,823
So, what made you choose
Sandford then ,Sergeant Angel?

229
00:17:41,206--> 00:17:43,146
It wasn't actually my choice.

230
00:17:43,365--> 00:17:47,714
Oh, right ,right, not your choice 
to come down here and tell me how
to do my job, our jobs.


231
00:17:52,637--> 00:17:55,526
Look i can assure you that it wasn't
my intention to upset the applicant.

232
00:17:55,711--> 00:17:58,781
Yeah. 'Cause we all sell apples
round here, don't we?

233
00:17:58,930--> 00:18:01,038
But Dad sells apples, Andie.
- And raspberrys.

234
00:18:01,844--> 00:18:04,549
you can't wait to jump 
in Sergeant Popwell's grave. 

235
00:18:04,733--> 00:18:07,548
I'm not jumping into anyones grave.

236
00:18:08,098--> 00:18:09,560
You got a mustache.

237
00:18:10,460--> 00:18:11,420
I know.

238
00:18:12,076--> 00:18:13,903
Why do you keep wearing stab
vest for ? 

239
00:18:14,096--> 00:18:15,185
It's a requirement.

240
00:18:15,334--> 00:18:19,331
In the city maybe. But nobody
is gonna stab you here Sergeant.

241
00:18:19,553--> 00:18:21,564
Not member of the public anyway. 

242
00:18:23,867--> 00:18:25,913
Have you been stabbed 
Sergeant Fisher?

243
00:18:26,135--> 00:18:27,927
No.
- Well I have.

244
00:18:28,374--> 00:18:31,372
And I can assure you it is 
not the least bit amusing.

245
00:18:32,614--> 00:18:36,539
you've seen a lot of action Sergeant Angel?
- I've experienced my fair share, yes.

246
00:18:36,944--> 00:18:39,501
Cook any falls?
- Excuse me?

247
00:18:39,686--> 00:18:43,272
Did you shoot anybody?
-He shot a crackhead with a kalashnitkov.

248
00:18:44,341--> 00:18:47,756
Where did you get that?
- The offender had the kalashnitkov.
 
249
00:18:48,480--> 00:18:49,905
Where did he get that?

250
00:18:50,061--> 00:18:53,096
You do know that there are 
more guns in the country than in the city?


251
00:18:53,281--> 00:18:57,775
Everybody and their Mum's is packing round here.
- Like who?

252
00:18:57,960--> 00:18:59,899
Farmers.
- Who else?

253
00:19:00,484--> 00:19:03,308
Farmer's mums.

254
00:19:06,123--> 00:19:11,191
What is it like being stabbed?
- It was the single most painful experience of my life.

255
00:19:12,627--> 00:19:15,584
What was the second most painful?

256
00:19:16,649--> 00:19:18,923
Did you ever fire two guns
whilst jumping off a vehicle?

257
00:19:18,991--> 00:19:20,059
No.

258
00:19:20,243--> 00:19:21,862
Did you ever fire one gun
whilst jumping off a vehicle?

259
00:19:21,909--> 00:19:22,778
No.

260
00:19:22,962--> 00:19:24,381
you ever been in a high speed
pursue?

261
00:19:24,601--> 00:19:25,552
Yes I have.

262
00:19:25,738--> 00:19:27,565
have you ever fired a gun 
whilst in high speed pursue?

263
00:19:27,714--> 00:19:30,493
No. "No more than one
schoolchild at any time "

264
00:19:31,676--> 00:19:36,027
That's Sergeant Angel coming into
your shop.????

265
00:19:36,869--> 00:19:38,689
What about Lethal Weapon?
- No.

266
00:19:38,948--> 00:19:40,264

268
00:19:43,017--> 00:19:44,992
You ain't  seen Bad Boys 2?

269
00:19:48,939--> 00:19:50,401
Hell of a day,huh? 
- Yep.

270
00:19:50,601--> 00:19:52,575
We get some more tomorrow?
- Yep.

271
00:19:58,273--> 00:20:01,345
Amanda Haborn.Head mistress
of Sandford Primary. 

272
00:20:01,565--> 00:20:02,809
How do you do Sergeant?

273
00:20:02,993--> 00:20:07,488
Simon Skinner I believe you've met.
- Oh yeah, We are already firm friends.

274
00:20:07,870--> 00:20:09,661
Please,please come with me.

275
00:20:09,882--> 00:20:11,937
This is Leslie Tiller.

276
00:20:12,159--> 00:20:16,061
Who's horticulture experteese has
helped put to Sandford on the map.

277
00:20:16,246--> 00:20:18,695
She is ever  good.
- Oh go on.

278
00:20:18,844--> 00:20:21,402
This is James Reaper,
who owns Banigan farm.

279
00:20:21,588--> 00:20:25,534
I hear you are quite a match. Perhaps
you might like to join us for shooting one day.

280
00:20:25,684--> 00:20:29,703
Well I haven't held a  firearm for
about over  2 years Mr.Reaper,
and I would kinda like to keep it that way it.

281
00:20:29,856--> 00:20:33,666
You will be popular among
the local birds.

282
00:20:34,654--> 00:20:36,847
Hello,Reverend Shooter.

283
00:20:37,105--> 00:20:40,321
I want to ask you,would you read a
homily at the Sunday service?

284
00:20:40,616--> 00:20:43,394
That might be  a little hypocritical
of me  Reverend.

285
00:20:43,615--> 00:20:45,129
Oh, you are an atheistic.

286
00:20:45,349--> 00:20:49,772
No, I am open to the concept of
religion, i am just not entirelly 
convinced by it.

287
00:20:49,956--> 00:20:53,063
You are an  Agnostic.
- I think I have a cream for that.

288
00:20:54,746--> 00:21:00,191
Robin Patcher, our resident in Sohommes?.
- Hopefully we wont see too much 
 of each other the coming months.

289
00:21:01,728--> 00:21:06,806
All that is  to welcome you to
the weekly meeting of the neighborhood watch alliance.

290
00:21:10,986--> 00:21:16,272
Now quick announcement before beginning.
Janet Barker has just given birth to twins.

291
00:21:17,784--> 00:21:21,585
So congratulations to her.Tom.
- Thanks Joyce.

292
00:21:22,609--> 00:21:24,327
Now...

293
00:21:24,621--> 00:21:29,313
I am sure that all you've noticed
the return of the blood to our streets.

294
00:21:29,572--> 00:21:34,797
It is all the more disturbing, as the 
village of the year contest noons.

295
00:21:34,981--> 00:21:40,094
I refer of course to the
extremely irritating living statue.

296
00:21:45,288--> 00:21:50,586
Police work is as much about preventing
crime, as it is about fighting crime.

297
00:21:50,808--> 00:21:54,206
Most importantly, it's about 
procedural correcness ,

298
00:21:54,392--> 00:21:57,338
in the execution of the
unquestionable moral  authority.

299
00:21:58,144--> 00:22:00,300
Any question?

300
00:22:02,435--> 00:22:03,495
Yes?

301
00:22:04,610--> 00:22:09,427
Is it true that there is a place in
a mans head, that if you shoot it, it'll blow up?

302
00:22:12,570--> 00:22:16,699
Hello. Tim Messenger.
Can I get a quick shot for the Sandford Citizen?

303
00:22:17,001--> 00:22:19,758
How 'bout you put the teacher in handcuffs?

304
00:22:19,941--> 00:22:23,233
I don't think it give off the right signals.
- Too cheesypie.Ok, I get you.

305
00:22:23,635--> 00:22:25,864
Give the little blong kid your hat.
- I'd rather not.

306
00:22:26,122--> 00:22:28,230
Oh,wave your stick about.
- No.

307
00:22:30,424--> 00:22:32,836
"The Cop Angle"

308
00:22:34,240--> 00:22:37,494
Can I have your autograph please?

309
00:22:39,212--> 00:22:41,734
For the breakfast.

310
00:22:45,170--> 00:22:46,962
"Top cock Angle... "

311
00:22:47,803--> 00:22:49,631
Hey,that weren't me.

312
00:22:50,546--> 00:22:52,374
Morning Angle.
- Morning Angle.

313
00:22:53,620--> 00:22:56,031
MOrning Angle.
- Sergeant Angel.

314
00:22:56,251--> 00:22:57,742
Good morning. The swans escaped.

315
00:22:57,925--> 00:22:58,771
The swans escaped?

316
00:22:58,819--> 00:22:59,714
Yeah.

317
00:22:59,799--> 00:23:01,885
Right. And where has the swan 
escaped exactly?

318
00:23:02,031--> 00:23:03,604
The castle.
- oh yeah. And who might you be?

319
00:23:03,789--> 00:23:09,330
Mr. Staker. The Mr. PI Staker.
- PI Staker,right, Pisstaker.Come on.

320
00:23:10,514--> 00:23:14,221
Yes Mister Staker we'll do everything
we can. Can you describe it?

321
00:23:14,442--> 00:23:19,704
??? long slender neck 
orange and black beak.

322
00:23:20,926--> 00:23:22,534
Anything else?

323
00:23:22,755--> 00:23:25,058
I's a swan.

324
00:23:32,185--> 00:23:34,048
It's gonna scare him.

325
00:23:38,763--> 00:23:41,651
No luck
catching them swans then?

326
00:23:41,872--> 00:23:43,955
I's just one swan actually.

327
00:23:46,552--> 00:23:49,512
You wan't anything from the shop?
- You've just been to the shop.

328
00:23:50,499--> 00:23:52,363
I'm thinking of a different shop.

329
00:23:52,550--> 00:23:55,071
Officer Butterman this is not
the time of personal errands.

330
00:23:55,255--> 00:23:58,401
well,there's nothing going on is there?
-There is always something going on.

331
00:23:58,621--> 00:24:00,558
You have to look closer. Alright?

332
00:24:00,707--> 00:24:03,084
What about this guy?

333
00:24:03,559--> 00:24:05,972
Mr. Treacher?
- Yeah, why has he got a big coat on?

334
00:24:06,703--> 00:24:10,652
he can't be cold. Why the extra
???? Maybe he's trying to hide something.

335
00:24:11,274--> 00:24:13,430
Mr. Treacher?

336
00:24:13,688--> 00:24:14,836
Ok.what about this guy? 

337
00:24:14,984--> 00:24:17,469
Ask yourself , why has he got his
hat fall down like that?

338
00:24:17,618--> 00:24:20,907
he is fuck ugly.
- Or he doesn't want us to see his face.

339
00:24:21,057--> 00:24:23,322
Because he is fuck ugly.

340
00:24:23,344--> 00:24:24,717
OK. What's his story?

341
00:24:25,059--> 00:24:26,705
Oh, that's lurch.
- Go on?

342
00:24:26,862--> 00:24:28,506
He is a trolleyboy at
 the local supermarket.

343
00:24:28,618--> 00:24:30,594
Real name  Michael Amstrong.

344
00:24:30,742--> 00:24:33,497
dad says he's got a child's mind.
- ok. 

345
00:24:33,645--> 00:24:35,620
He lives up Summer street
with his mother and sister.

346
00:24:35,768--> 00:24:37,633
And are they as big as
he is? Who?

347
00:24:37,743--> 00:24:41,216
The mum and the sister?
- Same person.

348
00:24:42,350--> 00:24:44,471
What show were you thinking of?

349
00:24:47,088--> 00:24:52,288
Fury Silente. Martial Arts master
versus it superhuman killingmachine.

350
00:25:06,422--> 00:25:09,162
Sergeant Angel to the Manager's Office.

351
00:25:09,348--> 00:25:12,819
Manager Office Sergeant Angel.

352
00:25:15,415--> 00:25:19,810
Ah, Sergeant Angel. Or is Angle?

353
00:25:21,044--> 00:25:24,480
Mr. Skinner is a baby's
sick in isle 6.

354
00:25:25,322--> 00:25:28,428
Please excuse. Michael.
- Yes?

355
00:25:28,759--> 00:25:31,171
Child vomit in isle 6, mop it up.

356
00:25:32,269--> 00:25:35,302
Mr.Skinner is there a problem?
- No, no.

357
00:25:35,924--> 00:25:39,762
i simply wanted to say how lovely 
to see you supporting yourlocal store.

358
00:25:40,106--> 00:25:41,213
Well that's quite allright.

359
00:25:41,397--> 00:25:45,988
All too many are defected by
the big megamarkt in Beauford Abbey.


360
00:25:46,610--> 00:25:48,987
their heads struck from their shoulders???.

361
00:25:50,230--> 00:25:54,324
Yes, well i am on duty,
so if you'll excuse me.

362
00:25:54,508--> 00:25:59,604
Of course. I simply spied you loitering on
organic produce and assumed you had time on your hands.

363
00:26:03,037--> 00:26:06,050
Well, maybe i am not the one
you should be keeping an eye on.

364
00:26:06,723--> 00:26:10,635
That's the fridge magnet,he's name is 
George Merchant, he has made
a fortune on kitchen goods.

365
00:26:10,855--> 00:26:13,305
Owns that monstrosity
in Norris avenue. 

366
00:26:13,862--> 00:26:16,278
Actually i wasn1t talking about him.
- Pardon?

367
00:26:16,572--> 00:26:18,546
I was talking about him.

368
00:26:20,666--> 00:26:22,714
Ah.
Excuse me.

369
00:26:25,317--> 00:26:27,110
Excuse me.

370
00:26:37,758--> 00:26:41,997
Super cop. Meet the cop
that can't be stopped.

371
00:27:02,263--> 00:27:05,126
Trouble in High street. 
Sergeant Angel pursues to...

372
00:27:05,383--> 00:27:07,322
Received.

373
00:27:16,865--> 00:27:18,657
Good morning Sergeant.

374
00:27:25,878--> 00:27:27,706
You mothers

375
00:27:32,920--> 00:27:34,090
Come on.

376
00:27:34,457--> 00:27:36,834
For the gardens?
-What's the matter Dannie?

377
00:27:37,019--> 00:27:39,322
Have you never taken a shortcut before?

378
00:28:22,792--> 00:28:24,656
Hey. Gimme that.

379
00:28:30,803--> 00:28:35,445
You don't have to say anything,
English:)

380
00:28:35,629--> 00:28:37,977
Any thing you do say can
be given to evidence.

381
00:28:38,124--> 00:28:39,624
Hello Danni.
-Oh, Pierre.

382
00:28:39,773--> 00:28:42,675
Do you know this man?
- He is Jackie's sister's brother's boy.

383
00:28:42,859--> 00:28:46,328
And it didn't occur to you  to mention this
before? I couldn't see his face,could I?
?? the eyes.

384
00:28:57,941--> 00:28:59,405
Impressive card.

385
00:28:59,808--> 00:29:02,476
Shame Mr.Skinner doesn't 
want to press charges.

386
00:29:02,624--> 00:29:04,161
What do you mean doesn't want to press charges?

387
00:29:04,309--> 00:29:07,891
I'm simply suggesting Peter
be given a second chance.

388
00:29:08,184--> 00:29:11,109
Before hee becomes
just another crime statistic.

389
00:29:11,295--> 00:29:13,890
I am sure he is going to learn
a valuable lesson.

390
00:29:14,110--> 00:29:17,730
Stealing biscuits is wrong?
- Correct.

391
00:29:18,095--> 00:29:19,092
Oh thanks.

392
00:29:19,240--> 00:29:21,991
And yet we respond by not
taking a single punitive measure.

393
00:29:22,248--> 00:29:25,903
That's what make the cookie crumbles.
- Right the biscuits, ain't it?

394
00:29:26,926--> 00:29:29,230
Mr. Skinner...
- is everything all right?

395
00:29:30,086--> 00:29:31,439
Well sir,

396
00:29:32,101--> 00:29:36,923
Mr. Skinner feels it would be better not to 
prosecute an individual, that has comitted a 
blatant offence. 

397
00:29:37,107--> 00:29:42,298
Leave this with me. 
I'll make sure everyone gets their justice . 

398
00:29:46,501--> 00:29:50,522
27.
- Have you ever seen Point Break?

399
00:29:50,778--> 00:29:51,876
No.

400
00:29:52,024--> 00:29:55,752 
Amazing  group of surfers.
- Don't tell me. 29.

401
00:29:56,047--> 00:30:00,178
Patrick Swayze just robs this bank. Keanu
Reeves's chasing him through people's gardens.

402
00:30:00,470--> 00:30:03,358
And he wants to shoot Swayze, but he can't
'cause he loves him so much.

403
00:30:03,508--> 00:30:06,773
And he's fireing gun up in the air and goes like Ahhhhh.
- 30.

404
00:30:07,140--> 00:30:08,982
have you ever fired your gun
up in the air and gone Aaahhhh?

405
00:30:09,129--> 00:30:12,457
No. I have not ever fired my 
gun up in the air and gone Aaahhhh.

406
00:30:12,715--> 00:30:17,794
30. Sorry. I just  feel like i am
missing out sometimes.

407
00:30:17,943--> 00:30:20,832
I want to do what you do.
- You do do what I do.

408
00:30:21,016--> 00:30:22,734
What on earth do you think
you're missing out?

409
00:30:22,882--> 00:30:26,428
Gun fights,car chases, 
proper action and shit.

410
00:30:26,622--> 00:30:30,632
Police work is not about 
proper action or shits.

411
00:30:30,818--> 00:30:33,047
29.
- If you would've payed attention to me in 

412
00:30:33,195--> 00:30:35,681
school, you'd understand that it's not all about
gunfights   

413
00:30:35,793--> 00:30:37,804
and carchases.

414
00:30:39,010--> 00:30:40,912
fire the roof 

415
00:30:43,946--> 00:30:46,250
That was brilliant.

416
00:30:48,553--> 00:30:52,974
Were i going a tad fast, officer?
- Yes, you were Mr. Blower.

417
00:30:53,561--> 00:30:58,296
Well, you see we are staging a hommage
to William Shakespeare's drama
Romeo and Juliet


418
00:30:58,992--> 00:31:04,035
I am a little late for dress
rehersal.I am playing the eponymous hero.

419
00:31:04,257--> 00:31:06,939
Romeo, not Juliet.

420
00:31:08,365--> 00:31:11,326
What are you writing?
- Everything you are saying. I might...

421
00:31:11,511--> 00:31:15,093
need to reffer to it later.
- Now Officer , I am a respected solicitor

422
00:31:15,255--> 00:31:18,034
so there is no need to...
would you stop writing.

423
00:31:18,218--> 00:31:23,663
Look, I am merely trying to explain 
why I might have exceeded the speed limit. 

424
00:31:23,850--> 00:31:27,649
You are playing the mail lead in  hommage
to William Shakespeare's Romeo and juliet.

425
00:31:27,759--> 00:31:30,649
and you are late for the dress rehersal.
You think this is sufficien reason

426
00:31:30,797--> 00:31:33,648
to travel at 48 in a 30 zone?
- Well..

427
00:31:33,871--> 00:31:36,830
The flat speed limits 
specifically were emplaced to save lives.

428
00:31:37,052--> 00:31:40,195
This is preposterous.
- Preposterous.

429
00:31:40,453--> 00:31:43,924
look, stop writing.
- Stop writing.

430
00:31:45,790--> 00:31:47,581
Look,

431
00:31:47,913--> 00:31:51,128
you are right, I apologize.

432
00:31:51,970--> 00:31:53,975
See what I did there?
- You hypnotized him.

433
00:31:54,195--> 00:31:58,106
No. Use this. This is the most important
piece of equipment you'll ever own.


434
00:31:58,255--> 00:32:00,850
This notebook has sabed my skin  
more times than I care to mention.

435
00:32:01,012--> 00:32:02,476
You should think about
using yours more.

436
00:32:02,585--> 00:32:05,293
I do use mine.
- Show me.

437
00:32:10,263--> 00:32:13,846
That's just extraordinary.
- You should see the one on the other side.

438
00:32:19,253--> 00:32:22,490
What are you up to tonight?
- I have to water my Peace Lilly.

439
00:32:22,638--> 00:32:25,461
I thought you might wanna do something.
- What exactly were you thinking? 

440
00:32:25,610--> 00:32:29,519
I dunno. Pub?
- I don't think that's a good idea.

441
00:32:29,756--> 00:32:31,364
See you.

442
00:32:33,411--> 00:32:35,019
Oi, you two.

443
00:32:35,204--> 00:32:39,590
A Mr. Blower left you tickets
for Romeo and Juliet tonight.

444
00:32:39,775--> 00:32:42,225
Said it was  an apology.
- Yeah?

445
00:32:43,066--> 00:32:46,977
Well,we can't accept gifts from 
somebody we officially reviwed, so..

446
00:32:50,156--> 00:32:51,912
Nicholas glad I caught you.

447
00:32:52,060--> 00:32:55,495
Wouldn't you mind representing us 
at the ??? tonight. 


448
00:32:55,680--> 00:32:59,372
Yes sir, of course.
- And there is a spare one for Danni.

449
00:33:00,688--> 00:33:02,918
Hey, come on, it might be fun.

450
00:33:03,615--> 00:33:07,780
A trinket for the death.

451
00:33:09,389--> 00:33:12,861
Here's to my love.

452
00:33:24,993--> 00:33:26,859
Poison.

453
00:33:27,042--> 00:33:29,611
I'll kiss thy lips.

454
00:33:29,867--> 00:33:33,595
I'll take some poison for my.

455
00:34:00,378--> 00:34:01,768
Sergeant Angel, hello.

456
00:34:02,098--> 00:34:04,546
A quick word for
the Sandford Citizen.

457
00:34:04,732--> 00:34:06,823
It was very enjoyable.
- A cop enjoys watching young lovers.

458
00:34:06,973--> 00:34:09,640 
I don't think so.
- Local ??? some teen suicide?

459
00:34:09,789--> 00:34:11,690
That's just grossly inappropriate.

460
00:34:11,986--> 00:34:15,566
You will spell his name correctly
this time,won't you Timothy?

461
00:34:15,751--> 00:34:18,104
Absolute tosh,wasn't it?

462
00:34:18,325--> 00:34:21,724
Annoyingly the owners are actually
professional actors.

463
00:34:22,383--> 00:34:25,692
Greg over there was an actor
in Strong Dogs and Sherry
portrayed a cadaver in a crime
suspect.

464
00:34:27,445--> 00:34:32,416
Sergeant Angel, you came. So thrilled
you accepted my invitation.

465
00:34:32,710--> 00:34:35,415
Well, Inspector requested
we attend.

466
00:34:35,672--> 00:34:39,218
we can't accept gifts from someone
we officially reviwed, so

467
00:34:39,512--> 00:34:41,742
jog on.

468
00:34:42,621--> 00:34:48,185
Congratulations to you and to Mrs. Blower.
- This is not my wife. This is 

469
00:34:50,369--> 00:34:52,294
Miss Draper, my leading lady.

470
00:34:53,099--> 00:34:57,012
Eve works in the local Council
Sergeant. And quite a  lady indeed.

471
00:34:57,487--> 00:34:58,731
I am not.

472
00:34:58,916--> 00:35:04,724
Nonesense. I am sure if we bashed 
your head open, all sorst of secrets
woukld come dumpling out. 

473
00:35:08,967--> 00:35:13,389
Romeo, Romeo, a pint of bear for Romeo.

474
00:35:14,195--> 00:35:16,243
A pleasure.

475
00:35:17,339--> 00:35:19,970
Eve is nice, ain't she?
- She certainly has a distinctive laugh.

476
00:35:21,287--> 00:35:24,175
Since I met her in school
always had a thong for her.

477
00:35:24,723--> 00:35:27,481
She clearly has a thing for older men.

478
00:35:27,884--> 00:35:30,625 
Not with Martin Blower? No way.

479
00:35:30,810--> 00:35:33,110
We just have sit through 3
hours of so called acting, constable 

480
00:35:33,367--> 00:35:38,191
Their kiss was the only convincing moment in it.
- Now that you come to mention, 

481
00:35:38,339--> 00:35:40,607
I too have a reason to believe
that she favors the older gents.

482
00:35:40,756--> 00:35:45,103
Really? How so?
- My uncle Carl's big brother said that he had fingered 
her up, the dung hole.

483
00:35:48,467--> 00:35:50,221
Oh, Officer. 

484
00:35:50,406--> 00:35:53,309
Again let me extend my 
sincere apologies for earlier. 

485
00:35:53,565--> 00:35:58,573
All right Mr. Blower.
Drive safe.

486
00:36:02,643--> 00:36:08,051
Drive safe. Oh my god. You 
knew that was the bloke
we had for speeding earlier.

487
00:36:09,038--> 00:36:11,891
Yeah. Hopefully that's the last we'll
see of him.

488
00:36:23,473--> 00:36:25,667
Who is it?

489
00:36:29,468--> 00:36:31,881
We haven't got long.

490
00:36:32,649--> 00:36:34,806
To us.

491
00:36:35,876--> 00:36:37,301
Who is it?

492
00:36:48,924--> 00:36:51,373
Yeah?

493
00:36:53,714--> 00:36:56,090
Decapitated?

494
00:36:59,489--> 00:37:02,632
Libby found them.
That always paper round ??? .

495
00:37:03,823--> 00:37:09,597
They'll be having nightmares
for a while.Must have been
going at some speed.

496
00:37:09,746--> 00:37:13,148
Pulled the whole top off.
- I would have my top off with this playboy?.

497
00:37:13,439--> 00:37:18,661
Lost the control,
Left the road there, and then ended up here.

498
00:37:22,210--> 00:37:27,145
So, what do we reckon?

499
00:37:27,328--> 00:37:31,240
Sergeant Angel.
- We should put a cordon,to off screen

500
00:37:31,464--> 00:37:34,129
remains from public view, close down the
road until the ambulance car arrives, 

501
00:37:34,283--> 00:37:37,685
whereupon we should open a single line
of traffic and aid congestion.

502
00:37:37,870--> 00:37:39,455
Very good.

503
00:37:39,858--> 00:37:41,615
What he said.

504
00:37:46,511--> 00:37:48,236
What happened Danni?
- Car accident.

505
00:37:48,385--> 00:37:50,176
Nasty way to go.

506
00:37:51,090--> 00:37:53,833
Constable,Official Vocab Guideline statement,
we no longer refer to these incidents 

507
00:37:54,018--> 00:37:57,271
as accidenst ,but collisions.
- All right.

508
00:37:57,426--> 00:38:02,512
There was never was a story of 
more woe than this of Juliet
and eternal Romeo.

509
00:38:03,849--> 00:38:07,541
Excuse me?
- Martin and Eve. Such a tragedy.

510
00:38:07,908--> 00:38:11,965
Mr. Skinner do you mind telling me 
how you know about the identity of 
the persons involved?


511
00:38:12,157--> 00:38:17,639
You know how it is,
news travels fast. 

512
00:38:20,030--> 00:38:23,246
What happened Danni?
- Traffic collision.

513
00:38:23,941--> 00:38:25,551
Why can't we say accident, again?

514
00:38:25,699--> 00:38:28,805
Because  accident implies
there's nobody to blame.

515
00:38:29,502--> 00:38:33,156
Put a stocking in a town mouse.
- Yeah.You want to be a big cop 
in a small town?

516
00:38:33,340--> 00:38:36,704.
Fuck off in a rural village ????
- I am just saying thing aren't 


517
00:38:36,852--> 00:38:39,229
always as simple,as they look.
Most times they are.


518
00:38:39,414--> 00:38:42,336
Let's just wait till dr.Pretchett
comes back with something.

519
00:38:42,521--> 00:38:44,897
Before you go jump ing the kalashtnikov.

520
00:38:45,119--> 00:38:48,079
Allright, in the meantime
why don't you, check out
a few of Martin Blowers clients? 

521
00:38:48,227--> 00:38:52,373
Martin Blower represent damly most the village.
You want us to call the whole phonebook?

522
00:38:52,629--> 00:38:56,686
We will call into R... and A...,shall we?
- Please, don't be childish.

523
00:38:56,879--> 00:38:59,473
At least consider interviewing the
widow, Martin Blower was clearly 

524
00:38:59,589--> 00:39:03,789
having an affaire with Eve Draper.
- And how did you establish that?

525
00:39:03,937--> 00:39:07,746
Because we sat throug 3 hours of so called acting 
last night, and the kiss was the only 

526
00:39:07,895--> 00:39:11,367
convincing moment in it.
- All right. Defend him.

527
00:39:11,588--> 00:39:15,061
Yeah what else You've got crocky and tubby?
- Skid marks.

528
00:39:15,427--> 00:39:18,426
Now, who's being childish?
- There were no skid marks in the street.

529
00:39:18,727--> 00:39:23,632
Doesn't it seem a little strange 
that Martin Blower would loose control
of his car and not think to apply the 
brakes? 

530
00:39:24,255--> 00:39:27,887
If there were no skidmarks that follows for
300 yards,both driver and passenger 

531
00:39:28,071--> 00:39:32,915
did nothing to prevent their fate. You
don't have to be a detective to work that out.

532
00:39:33,132--> 00:39:36,311
Are they causing trouble?
- Yes, they are.

533
00:39:36,495--> 00:39:42,453
Well spot a bother up at Elroy Farm. 
Old Arthur Webbley has been clipping
hedge rose, that don't belong to him.


534
00:39:42,678--> 00:39:45,086
Yes sir?
- that's it.

535
00:39:45,672--> 00:39:47,107
Yes sir.

536
00:39:52,553--> 00:39:56,353
Why do we need the dog.
- It's not the dog we need.

537
00:40:03,447--> 00:40:04,699
Right.

538
00:40:04,911--> 00:40:05,862
What did he say?

539
00:40:11,721--> 00:40:12,454
What did he say?

540
00:40:12,639--> 00:40:14,925
He said a hedge is a hedge. He only chopped
it down, 'cause it's blocked his view.

541
00:40:15,074--> 00:40:16,720
Whats the problem about?

542
00:40:16,904--> 00:40:20,559
I appreciate your position Mr. Webley, but
you can't go...

543
00:40:20,744--> 00:40:22,691
round chopping other people's
hedges without permission.

544
00:40:24,445--> 00:40:26,529
Yes, I suppose.
- Thank you.

545
00:40:28,202--> 00:40:29,351
Allright.

546
00:40:30,885--> 00:40:33,568
Mr. Webley, I trust that
you have licence for that firearm.

547
00:40:36,126--> 00:40:38,406
He does for this one.

548
00:40:39,467--> 00:40:41,924
What do you mean by this one?

549
00:40:54,458--> 00:40:57,309
For the power of Christ.

550
00:40:57,493--> 00:40:59,615
Where on earth did you get these?

551
00:41:00,492--> 00:41:03,343
He found them.
- And what is this?

552
00:41:04,295--> 00:41:06,232
It is a sea mine.

553
00:41:06,854--> 00:41:09,085
Well,Mr. Webley this it is an 
extremely dangerous collection.

554
00:41:09,233--> 00:41:11,134
It is wonder that nobody's
been hurt before.

555
00:41:11,502--> 00:41:14,279
Na, it's a load of junk.

556
00:41:25,586--> 00:41:27,889
Move, move.

557
00:41:48,280--> 00:41:50,960
Are you hurt?
- No,apparently it's been deactivated, over.

558
00:41:51,110--> 00:41:54,216
It's not live. Deactivated.
- It's not live.

559
00:41:54,364--> 00:41:56,484
It is not live.
- All right.

560
00:42:19,375--> 00:42:24,418
That was quite an impressive haul today,
constable,wasn1t it?
- Yeah. Maybe we should do something to celebrate.

561
00:42:25,004--> 00:42:27,635
Besides watering your Peace lilly.
- What do you have in mind?

562
00:42:27,820--> 00:42:29,136
I don't know.

563
00:42:29,357--> 00:42:30,893
Pub?

564
00:42:37,595--> 00:42:39,569
Yes sirs, what can i get you?

565
00:42:39,718--> 00:42:42,971
Pint o' lager,please Roy... and what 
can i get you that isn't cranberry juice?

566
00:42:43,118--> 00:42:45,422
I don't really wanna get drunk.
-You'll get a  little drunk.

567
00:42:45,825--> 00:42:48,676
I'll have one.
- Yeah, that's what i'm talking about.

568
00:42:48,861--> 00:42:53,731
Mr. Porter what's your wine selection?
- We got red or...

569
00:42:54,901--> 00:42:56,693
white.

570
00:42:57,023--> 00:42:59,773
I'll have a pint of lager please.

571
00:43:04,851--> 00:43:08,883
Any news from earlier?
- Yeah. CSI found nothing.

572
00:43:09,360--> 00:43:12,064
Dr. Patcher  report
no misadventure,

573
00:43:12,248--> 00:43:16,233
and Mrs. Blower has 4 alibis.
-Come on Sergeant.

574
00:43:16,708--> 00:43:19,778
It's not your job
to investigate ??,is it?

575
00:43:21,095--> 00:43:24,384
Is it?
- No. It isn't.

576
00:43:26,882--> 00:43:30,464
You don't switch off, do you?
- You sound like my ex.

577
00:43:30,685--> 00:43:34,340
But you are always thinking away.
- That's what I do.

578
00:43:34,525--> 00:43:37,668
Don't get me wrong. I think it's amazing.
- Really?

579
00:43:37,853--> 00:43:41,289
What made you wanna be a policeman?
- Officer.

580
00:43:41,510--> 00:43:44,946
What made you wanna be a 
policeman, Officer?

581
00:43:46,883--> 00:43:50,722
I don't remember a time, when
I didn't wanna be a police officer.

582
00:43:50,868--> 00:43:54,344
Up till the summer of 1979 when
I wanted to become a .

583
00:43:55,073--> 00:43:58,801
It all started with my uncle Derrick.
he was a Sergeant of the Met.

584
00:43:59,168--> 00:44:02,100
He bought me a police
pedal car, when I was five. 

585
00:44:02,240--> 00:44:04,470
I rode round in every
second i was awake.

586
00:44:04,619--> 00:44:07,871
Arresting kids twice my
size for littering and spitting.

587
00:44:08,020--> 00:44:12,699
I got beaten up a lot when  was young,but
didn't stop me.I wanted to be like uncle Derrick.

588
00:44:12,847--> 00:44:15,223
Sounds like a good bloke.
- Actually he was arrested...

589
00:44:15,370--> 00:44:17,675
for selling drugs to students.
- What a cunt.

590
00:44:17,859--> 00:44:20,162
He probably bought the pedal
car with the proceeds.

591
00:44:20,309--> 00:44:22,759
Needlless to say, I never
went near it again.

592
00:44:22,908--> 00:44:26,306
I just let it rust. But I never forgot the clear
sense of right and the wrong that I felt ...

593
00:44:26,492--> 00:44:29,452
at the wheel of that pedal car. I had to
prove to myself that the law...

594
00:44:29,570--> 00:44:32,971
could be proper, and righteous and for the 
good of human kind.

595
00:44:33,156--> 00:44:36,408
It was from that moment i
was destened to be a police officer.

596
00:44:37,104--> 00:44:38,969
Shame.
-How so?

597
00:44:39,371--> 00:44:42,405
Because you would've made a great muppet. 

598
00:44:45,659--> 00:44:48,822
What about you? What made you
wanna become a police officer?

599
00:44:49,006--> 00:44:52,039
I don't know. Dad does it.

600
00:44:52,226--> 00:44:56,136
I think after my mum died, that's what he wanted,
you know, keep me close by. 

601
00:44:56,321--> 00:45:01,035
Do you mind if I ask how she died?
-Traffic collision.

602
00:45:01,256--> 00:45:03,194
I am sorry.

603
00:45:03,456--> 00:45:06,088
Never mind. Hey whatch this. 

604
00:45:07,546--> 00:45:10,287
Jesus Christ.
- Oh my eye.

605
00:45:13,138--> 00:45:14,937
Do you want another?

606
00:45:26,864--> 00:45:29,350
Hello 777.
- Mr. Skinner.

607
00:45:29,535--> 00:45:31,535
You know George Merchant,don't you?

608
00:45:32,230--> 00:45:37,759
Yes, we were just discussing the accident.
- I knew Martin and Eve well.

609
00:45:38,381--> 00:45:42,585
It's such a loss.
- Let's  say we drink to their demise.

610
00:45:42,770--> 00:45:46,681
Should not we drink to their memories?
-Of course. Cheers.

611
00:45:46,901--> 00:45:49,279
I must go to the little boys room?

612
00:45:49,974--> 00:45:53,592
I'm allright. 
- Little be inoperative word.

613
00:45:53,886--> 00:45:56,665
He'll be in bed tomorrow.

614
00:46:04,777--> 00:46:08,798
I think somebody needs to go home.
- I am not that drunk Sir

615
00:46:09,054--> 00:46:13,002
Not you.

616
00:46:13,515--> 00:46:14,868
Him. What?

617
00:46:17,207--> 00:46:19,771
Hey, we did get a little drunk.
You get it, because he is little,
and he is drunk.

618
00:46:24,413--> 00:46:29,786
This is my mansion. He/she doesn't have anything that
to do with the rustic hairdresser of the town.???

619
00:46:30,919--> 00:46:33,295
How much do I owe you?
- 20 quid.

620
00:46:33,844--> 00:46:35,307
There you go.

621
00:46:36,502--> 00:46:40,046
And there is your change.
- God bless you, bye-bye.

622
00:46:44,103--> 00:46:45,821
I am allright.

623
00:46:48,455--> 00:46:51,166
I would not wanna be him in the morning.

624
00:47:02,912--> 00:47:06,822
Oh, this is me.
- Well. I am sure I'll see you in the morning.

625
00:47:08,687--> 00:47:11,447
Unless you want
to come in for a cup of coffee.

626
00:47:11,705--> 00:47:12,999
I don't drink coffee.

627
00:47:13,182--> 00:47:16,216
Tea?
- No caffeine after midday.

628
00:47:17,058--> 00:47:19,141
How about another beer?

629
00:47:34,270--> 00:47:37,524
When did you move in?
- About 5 years ago.

630
00:47:38,875--> 00:47:41,799
You should get some house plants.
- oh, yeah.

631
00:47:42,130--> 00:47:45,346
I've been turning? my peace lilly for 3 years now.

632
00:47:46,041--> 00:47:51,416
It oxygenates the room, helps you think, relieves
stress, it's needs are simple.

633
00:47:55,689--> 00:47:58,908
Janine used to say,that I loved
my lilly more than i loved her.

634
00:47:59,135--> 00:48:01,256
Is that why you split up?
- What?

635
00:48:01,987--> 00:48:04,399
Because you've done it with a plant?

636
00:48:04,585--> 00:48:09,336
No, no, no. It's more 
about me being obsessed 
with the job.

637
00:48:09,521--> 00:48:12,152
That's good though, right?

638
00:48:12,373--> 00:48:17,427
Is it though, I miss a few dinners
parties, a birthday or two.

639
00:48:19,575--> 00:48:21,659
Listen mate...
-Her dad's funeral.

640
00:48:23,486--> 00:48:29,086
I just wanna be good at what i do.
- You are good at what you do.

641
00:48:29,380--> 00:48:34,899
You just can't learn to
switch off, that big old melon of yours.

642
00:48:35,747--> 00:48:38,489
That's the whole problem Danni.

643
00:48:41,011--> 00:48:46,238
I don't think i know how.
- I could show you how.

644
00:48:51,974--> 00:48:55,483
By the power of Christ.

645
00:48:55,858--> 00:48:59,074
Point Break or Bad Boys 2?
- Which one do you think I'd prefer?

646
00:48:59,259--> 00:49:03,352
No, I mean which one do you to whatch first.
- You are pulling my leg.

647
00:49:44,170--> 00:49:45,926
What did you think of that?

648
00:49:46,365--> 00:49:49,802
Well, I won't argue it was a
travel without barriers full with adrenaline,

649
00:49:49,922--> 00:49:55,293
but there is not form of arming that whole chaos
without considering the whole paper work that takes.

650
00:49:56,478--> 00:49:59,292
That is nothing man. This
is about to go off.

651
00:50:15,456--> 00:50:19,585
Shit just got real.

652
00:50:21,121--> 00:50:22,839
Nasty way to go.

653
00:50:23,097--> 00:50:26,313
Look like Mr. Merchant tried to have
a little fry-up and left the gas on.

654
00:50:28,433--> 00:50:33,659
Spends his whole life devoted to the
refrigerator, and gets killed by an owen.

655
00:50:35,377--> 00:50:38,887
I told him several times. 
You shouldn't eat late at night.

656
00:50:39,072--> 00:50:41,265
I kindda like a little midnight gobble.

657
00:50:42,925--> 00:50:46,635
So, what do we reckon? Angel?
- Huh?

658
00:50:47,003--> 00:50:48,721
Help me.

659
00:50:49,708--> 00:50:53,035
OK. We get a proper cordon up,
we let the firecrew finish their stuff,

660
00:50:53,219--> 00:50:56,692
and then we get the forensic surgeons
to do a ???.
- Right.

661
00:50:57,534--> 00:51:00,860
What he said.
- Sergeant Angel a quick word.

662
00:51:01,008--> 00:51:03,457
Mr. Messenger a statement will
be issued shortly.

663
00:51:03,567--> 00:51:06,362
Actually I would just like to as:
What's your perfect Sunday?

664
00:51:06,511--> 00:51:11,689
I will deal with the press Sergeant.
- A Perfect Sunday is a lovely long...

665
00:51:29,314--> 00:51:32,274
What do you think?Foul play?
- Maybe.

666
00:51:33,046--> 00:51:36,662
We're just hoping to talk to the 
last people, who saw Mr. Merchant alive.

667
00:51:37,138--> 00:51:42,364
Maybe a Sergeant Nicholas Asswipe
and Constable Funny ???.

668
00:51:42,549--> 00:51:45,218
Beautiful.
-Why is this such a big joke to you?

669
00:51:45,366--> 00:51:49,351
3 people have died in one week.
- Oh come on Dr. Sherlock. they were accidents.

670
00:51:49,499--> 00:51:52,714
Accidents happen every day.
- The victims knew each other.

671
00:51:52,900--> 00:51:56,007
Everyone knows everyone around here.
-Yeah. If you didn't see anything suspicious,

672
00:51:56,169--> 00:51:58,773
then who did?

673
00:52:02,647--> 00:52:06,886
It's bit of a blind spot I am afraid. We
just catch the very edge of the explosion.
 
674
00:52:07,071--> 00:52:09,598
Well, you had a go.
- I've got something took my eye.

675
00:52:10,038--> 00:52:11,427
Really. what's that?

676
00:52:12,013--> 00:52:15,084
Sanfords most wanted.

677
00:52:16,802--> 00:52:20,768
There you go,it is the swan you want.
- This is not funny detective.

678
00:52:22,595--> 00:52:24,642
You do your job and we'll
do ours.

679
00:52:25,082--> 00:52:28,518
Yeah,I mean you got a church thing to look out??.
- NO,I'VE NOT.

680
00:52:29,629--> 00:52:31,322
Actually..

681
00:52:36,374--> 00:52:39,372
"Save the church roof"

682
00:53:14,768--> 00:53:16,742
Seen any murderings ?

683
00:53:16,964--> 00:53:19,411
Come on boys ,leave the Sergeant
Angel alone.He is working.

684
00:53:19,648--> 00:53:23,230
Sorry Chief. Won't waste
any more police time.

685
00:53:24,327--> 00:53:29,920
actually you just might as well take a break.
- hey,great. Got something to show you.

686
00:53:35,546--> 00:53:37,825
This isn't rifle match.
-You'll be really good at it.

687
00:53:38,595--> 00:53:41,080
Feeling lucky Sergeant?

688
00:53:41,821--> 00:53:47,025
3 cans wins you the squeky bunny,5 cans
gets you the fluffy lion,take all our little 
people,

689
00:53:48,647--> 00:53:50,840
you'll get ... cuddly monkey.

690
00:53:53,033--> 00:53:55,885
I thought I made it clear 
to you, how I feel about firearms.

691
00:53:56,325--> 00:53:59,833
It is a toy rifle.
- Sergeant.

692
00:54:18,647--> 00:54:20,622
Good Lord.

693
00:54:21,836--> 00:54:24,213
That was amazing.

694
00:54:28,342--> 00:54:31,213
Thank You Danny.
- I cannot believe I shot someone.

695
00:54:31,369--> 00:54:34,731
He is a Doctor. He can deal with it.
- It never shot anyone before.

696
00:54:34,916--> 00:54:37,657
Believe me it's not something you'll
ever get used to.

697
00:54:37,843--> 00:54:40,621
Maybe we should go to the bouncing
castle and take our minds off there.

698
00:54:40,951--> 00:54:42,378
Mr. Messenger.

699
00:54:42,526--> 00:54:44,800

Simon Skinner.

708
00:55:35,733--> 00:55:40,638
He is in the loo.
- Too much of Joyce's lemonade perhaps.

709
00:56:03,229--> 00:56:06,336

Excuse me, excuse me.

Stand Back, stand Back. There's
been a terrible accident.

714
00:57:10,241--> 00:57:12,764
Nicholas.What is it?
- Sir, I think all these deaths...

715
00:57:12,912--> 00:57:16,201
are linked. I think 
Tim Messenger was murdered.

716
00:57:16,422--> 00:57:19,530
Who could do something like this?
-Maybe it was the  swan?

717
00:57:19,714--> 00:57:21,687
Apperantly it could break a man's arm
or blow up a man's  house.

718
00:57:21,835--> 00:57:23,006
Listen you pair of ...

719

00:57:58,000--> 00:58:00,450
Do you really think this is murder?

733
00:58:00,606--> 00:58:02,364
I just  don't think we should rule it 
out, that's all.

734
00:58:02,512--> 00:58:04,086
Yeah, I think you are right.

735
00:58:06,607--> 00:58:10,338
He thinks you are talking a load of 
shit. At least that understood?.

736
00:58:10,740--> 00:58:14,979
Did you find anything?
- Yeah. I was extremely shocked

737
00:58:15,163--> 00:58:19,403

It's high time you realized that.
You and your monkey.

742
00:58:36,343--> 00:58:39,046
Did he mean me, or that?

743
00:58:40,144--> 00:58:43,289

Have you listened to anything that I've said?
- What do you mean?

746
00:58:48,448--> 00:58:51,152
Is there anything that I told you in the last two weeks

747
00:58:51,302--> 00:58:52,546

-Yeah.

795
01:02:05,631--> 01:02:08,995
Hey, where are you going?
- I have something to do???

796
01:02:15,636--> 01:02:19,392
Hello Ms. Tiller. I was wondering
do you have any Japanese Peace Lillys?

797
01:02:19,831--> 01:02:24,326
Of course. It was just about to
pop off actually.

798
01:02:25,314--> 01:02:29,519
I never find my scissors.
It's for someone special?

799
01:02:30,285--> 01:02:32,148
Yes, yes it is.

800
01:02:34,159--> 01:02:38,509
Are you going somewhere  Ms. Tiller?
- Yes, I am moving away.

801
01:02:40,885--> 01:02:43,334
Why the move? If you
don't mind me asking.

802
01:02:44,250--> 01:02:47,721
Well, just between you and I.
- Yes?

803
01:02:48,090--> 01:02:50,794
You know the fellow, that blew up?
- George Merchant?

804
01:02:51,050--> 01:02:54,378
Well George Merchant god rest him 
wanted to buy this land.

805
01:02:54,599--> 01:02:58,436
So he sent round his legal fellow Martin
Blower god rest him.

806
01:02:58,695--> 01:03:02,941

I really haven't got that much family 
round here

807
01:03:03,163--> 01:03:07,411
save for cousin Sissi. So I thought I might
take them up to Aunt Roman move to Buford Abbey.

808
01:03:07,705--> 01:03:10,592
Would you like a card with this?
- No. 

809
01:03:10,741--> 01:03:14,469
Sorry, you were talking about the offer.
- Well, it turns out that Martin Blower...

810
01:03:14,618--> 01:03:19,648
god rest him, knew avenue bypass road is
coming 'cause he was knocking up Eve Draper
from the Council, god rest her   

811
01:03:20,832--> 01:03:25,620
And then that reporter, god rest him,
finds out about the road and tells me 
this land  

812
01:03:25,783--> 01:03:30,936
is very valuable,  10 times than George
Merchant and Martin Blower, god rest them, offered me.

813
01:03:31,194--> 01:03:35,470
So with them having passed on,
I decided to sell it all myself to
some folks from the city 

814
01:03:35,654--> 01:03:39,675
that Martin, George and Eve, god rest them
have been talking to .Apparently

815
01:03:39,860--> 01:03:44,428
they want to build a big shopping
center or something. Of course
cousin Sissi won't be too happy about that.

816
01:03:44,830--> 01:03:50,350
But as far as i am concerned cousin 
Sissi can go fu.. 
- Would you just excuse me for just one second?

817
01:04:05,044--> 01:04:06,359
Stop.

818
01:04:06,997--> 01:04:09,569
In the name of the law.

819
01:05:06,856--> 01:05:12,003
hang on there, hang on there. You
are saying this wasn't an accident?

820
01:05:13,144--> 01:05:15,264
Leslie Tiller was
fucking murdered.

821
01:05:15,414--> 01:05:16,620
Just like Tim Messenger?
- Yes.

822
01:05:16,730--> 01:05:17,792
George Merchant?
- Yes.

823
01:05:17,902--> 01:05:19,001
And Eve Draper?
- Yes.

824
01:05:19,148--> 01:05:20,595
Martin Blower?
- No, actually.

825
01:05:20,744--> 01:05:23,412
Really?
- 'Course he fucking was.

826
01:05:23,560--> 01:05:24,987
Thank You Danni.

827
01:05:25,426--> 01:05:29,739
Murder, murder. Change the fucking
record. Thank You Andie.

828
01:05:30,106--> 01:05:34,566
Come on Sergeant,you've just gotta 
accept it was just another nasty accident.

829
01:05:34,750--> 01:05:38,185
What are you suggesting? That Leslie Tiller 
tripped and fell on her own shears?


830
01:05:38,333--> 01:05:40,857
Ben Fletcher fell on his pitchfork
the other week.

831
01:05:40,967--> 01:05:44,332
Yes, accidents happen all the  time,
what makes you think it was murder?

832
01:05:44,479--> 01:05:48,865
Because I was there.
- Here is a point,
why were you there?

833
01:05:49,050--> 01:05:53,618
I was buying Constable Butterman
a japanese Peace lilly for his birthday.

834
01:05:53,803--> 01:05:58,080
What absolute shit.
- I chases a suspect from the scene.

835
01:05:58,264--> 01:06:03,380
Innocent people don't run.
- Maybe it was our old friend the cactus thief.

836
01:06:03,601--> 01:06:06,686
Oh yeah, he was a prickly customer, wasn't he?

837
01:06:06,835--> 01:06:10,563
Am I going completely mad?

838
01:06:11,419--> 01:06:13,468
Maybe, you are.

839
01:06:14,901--> 01:06:17,673
Maybe you did it.

840
01:06:18,879--> 01:06:20,890
Yeah. Since you are such a 
big fan of murders.

841
01:06:21,074--> 01:06:22,723
What the fu...!
- Sergeant Angel?

842
01:06:22,907--> 01:06:24,006
Yes!

843
01:06:24,153--> 01:06:25,360
Sir

844
01:06:27,955--> 01:06:33,716
Nicholas Nicholas. What am I going to 
do with you?
- Sir, you have to understand...

845
01:06:35,266--> 01:06:38,263
No. Your you have to understand.

846
01:06:38,812--> 01:06:42,613
The boys here aren't used to the 
concepts you are bending? about.

847
01:06:43,382--> 01:06:48,777
The M word Nicholas. There hasn't been
a recorded murder in Sandford for 20 years.

848
01:06:50,253--> 01:06:54,056
But Sir I am
certain. And what's more,

849
01:06:54,422--> 01:06:56,287
I know who did it.

850
01:07:02,061--> 01:07:04,071
Can I see the manager please?

851
01:07:09,333--> 01:07:14,364
Mr. Skinner to the manager's office.
The manager's office Mr. Skinner.

852
01:07:16,572--> 01:07:21,249
Sergeant Angel? And to what do I owe this pleasure?
- Simon Skinner I am arresting you on suspicion ...

853
01:07:21,397--> 01:07:25,053
of the murder of Leslie Tiller.
- Leslie Tiller is dead?

854
01:07:25,931--> 01:07:29,819
How?
-She tripped and fell on her own shears.

855
01:07:31,209--> 01:07:34,389
I'm also arresting you on suspicion for the 
murder of Tim Messenger on May 1,

856
01:07:34,573--> 01:07:39,216
of George Merchant 29 April and Eve
Draper and Martin Blower April 28.

857
01:07:39,341--> 01:07:43,290
Why on earth would I do that Sergeant?
- I am glad you asked.

858
01:07:44,678--> 01:07:47,895
My suspicions were first
aroused, when you came to the scene of the...

859
01:07:48,005--> 01:07:51,347
Blower and Draper death on the outskirts
of Sandford, despite the fact,

860
01:07:51,458--> 01:07:54,164
you live and work in the centre of the village.

861
01:07:55,042--> 01:07:58,369
I couldn't help, but recall your comments
in the theater, the previous evening.

862
01:07:59,758--> 01:08:04,363
Not only indicate the awareness of the 
couples affaire, but also infered that

863
01:08:04,473--> 01:08:07,834
these connections of the Council  
might make her preview to 
important information.

864
01:08:07,983--> 01:08:11,710
You even spoke of bashing her head,
perhaps hoping you might discover 
the route of 


865
01:08:11,859--> 01:08:15,449
the proposed Sandford bypass. You
were already suspicious that George Merchant...

866
01:08:15,600--> 01:08:18,850
was buying up a large area of land
on the outskirts of Sandford, after an

867
01:08:18,998--> 01:08:21,595
article Tim Messenger wrote
in the Sandford Citizen .

868
01:08:21,742--> 01:08:25,471
You see the land Merchant was buying
had little value in itself, but...

869
01:08:25,619--> 01:08:29,566
if it became an accessable byroad ,
It'll be a prime location, for say,

870
01:08:29,677--> 01:08:33,663
a retail park. Consumed and
concerned for your business and potential...

871
01:08:33,811--> 01:08:37,662
disloyalty of fickled customers
you yourself expressed a wish to behead.

872
01:08:37,809--> 01:08:42,283
You killed the competetition in cold blood.
Framing the murders as accidents.

873
01:08:42,470--> 01:08:47,183
I used a vehicle removal truck to 
stage the Blower-Draper death. And incinerated

874
01:08:47,330--> 01:08:52,091
an old man,in his own house
???? try to cover up with the application of bacon and beans.

875
01:08:52,312--> 01:08:55,711
However, there was a loose end.

876
01:08:56,014--> 01:09:00,295
Tim Messenger. Splattered,before he
could share with me ,what he told


877
01:09:00,442--> 01:09:05,438
Leslie Tiller that very afternoon. The
true value of her land.

878
01:09:06,060--> 01:09:08,764
Upon descovering she was about to 
sell up to the developers,

879
01:09:08,913--> 01:09:11,800
you brutally murderer 
her with her own shears.

880
01:09:11,949--> 01:09:14,837
And may could you escape
utilizing your impressive skills

881
01:09:15,057--> 01:09:18,201
as a fun runner.

882
01:09:22,888--> 01:09:26,834
Very entertaining, but I rather
think you've been watching too many films.

883
01:09:28,333--> 01:09:29,758
He hasn't.

884
01:09:29,981--> 01:09:32,818
Why would I kill Leslie? You clearly
aren't aware, that we are related.

885
01:09:33,112--> 01:09:34,282
Oh, but I am.

886
01:09:34,503--> 01:09:36,953
Cousin Sissi.

887
01:09:37,684--> 01:09:41,888
I'm afraid my nickname of Sissi
is only a revelation to yourself.

888
01:09:42,109--> 01:09:45,545
My teenage years of studying
ballet are well-known.

889
01:09:45,729--> 01:09:48,617
Yeah. Sissi Skinner.
- Or gay lord.

890
01:09:48,875--> 01:09:50,338
Thank You Andrews.

891
01:09:50,492--> 01:09:54,550
Now, despite my comments about
beheading customers, I personally...

892
01:09:54,735--> 01:09:59,524
relish the competition of another store.
Anything to energize

893
01:09:59,744--> 01:10:02,632
my work force.

894
01:10:02,817--> 01:10:07,247
And anyway,what makes you think
I could dislodge part of the  

895
01:10:07,386--> 01:10:10,165
churchal roof.Or for that
matter the rage??? of God.

896
01:10:10,275--> 01:10:13,202
It's a well-known fact that the church
roof is in dieing need of repair.


897
01:10:13,350--> 01:10:17,992
And isn't it true, that 2 of your
own employees operate the vehicle removing service
for the castle?

898
01:10:18,359--> 01:10:23,535
Sergeant. This is the century 21. Many 
people hold down several jobs.I myself 

899
01:10:24,683--> 01:10:29,719
 am teacher of a drawing class.???
Tina here is a table dancer at Flatley.

900
01:10:30,671--> 01:10:34,618
Nevertheless you could've utilized
the vehicle removal truck for your own ends.

901
01:10:34,766--> 01:10:37,910
These accusations are quite meaningless
Sergeant, unless you can back them

902
01:10:38,020--> 01:10:39,180
up with hard evidence.

903
01:10:39,445--> 01:10:41,894
Well, you1ve got me there.

904
01:10:42,151--> 01:10:44,126
I need something conclusive.

905
01:10:44,310--> 01:10:46,394
Something that'd place you at
the scene of the crime.

906
01:10:46,542--> 01:10:50,563
Perhaps a wound from a piece
of broken glass  this very evening.

907
01:10:52,318--> 01:10:54,549
This very evening.

908
01:10:55,937--> 01:11:00,725
This is beggining to get emberrasing.
How could I possibly be several...

909
01:11:00,875--> 01:11:03,469
places at once?

910
01:11:04,385--> 01:11:09,173
I am sure the store security
footage will absolve me.

911
01:11:09,510--> 01:11:12,348
Do feel free, to spool through.

912
01:11:29,329--> 01:11:32,519
I can handle this Danny. You might as
well go back and enjoy the rest of your
birthday.

913
01:11:33,871--> 01:11:37,855
Did you really get me that plant?
- Yes, I did. But...

914
01:11:38,186--> 01:11:41,986
it's been impounded as evidence.

915
01:11:43,011--> 01:11:46,315
If you find something you let me know,heh?
- Yeah.

916
01:11:49,456--> 01:11:53,842
Sergeant I wanted you to know that if I
do indeed now own the land belonging to..

917
01:11:55,428--> 01:12:00,713
belonging to Leslie, i intend
to turn in into a memorial garden, in her
honour.

918
01:12:01,934--> 01:12:06,622
Mr. Skinner what you do with your land
is of no concern of mine, so...

919
01:12:09,144--> 01:12:11,339
jog on.

920
01:12:11,558--> 01:12:16,347
Michael will you escort the 
Sergaent off the premises, 
when he is quite finished? 

921
01:12:21,097--> 01:12:25,081
I just can't believe Leslie's
dead. How did it happen?

922
01:12:25,265--> 01:12:28,665
she tripped and fell on her own
shears.

923
01:12:33,641--> 01:12:35,176
"Twat."

924
01:12:35,434--> 01:12:37,956
hey,that weren't me.

925
01:12:45,897--> 01:12:50,576
Hey, look, look Mr. Treacher's
got his big coat on again.

926
01:12:53,539--> 01:12:57,959
you want anything from the shop?
- A Corneto.

927
01:13:00,226--> 01:13:05,671
No luck cathcing them killers then?
- It's just one killer actually.

928
01:13:08,304--> 01:13:13,056
No luck cathcing them killers then?
- It's just one killer actually.

929
01:13:19,013--> 01:13:21,937
what's the matter? You've got brain freeze?
- No i got brain wave.

930
01:13:22,157--> 01:13:24,790
get us back to the station. Now.

931
01:13:31,295--> 01:13:33,057
It's more than one person.
-What?

932
01:13:33,207--> 01:13:35,985
It's more than one killer.
- It was Skinner a minute ago.

933
01:13:36,134--> 01:13:39,532
Yeah,well,maybe still is,you know, maybe
he is not alone.Maybe there are others.

934
01:13:39,789--> 01:13:45,273
Nicholas. You are an exceptional officer.
But I've seen this before. 

935
01:13:45,421--> 01:13:47,980
Sir?
- Sergeant Pumpwell.

936
01:13:48,164--> 01:13:53,764
It was exactly the same thing. You've come from the
city where there's danger round every corner.

937
01:13:55,913--> 01:13:59,942
And it's driven you round the bend .
-Yes sir.

938
01:14:00,236--> 01:14:02,210
Do yourself a favor.

939
01:14:02,394--> 01:14:03,930
sleep on it.

940
01:14:04,079--> 01:14:09,255
And if you still feel the same in 
the morning,I give you my word, 
I'll get right on it.

941
01:14:13,837--> 01:14:15,373
hey,hey.

942
01:14:15,558--> 01:14:20,734
What's happening, what's going on?
-Nothing,nothing. I am just gonna go
back to the hotel.

943
01:14:22,612--> 01:14:27,691
Do you want a lift?
- No, no. I could do with a walk.

944
01:15:30,634--> 01:15:32,023
Hey biggo.

945
01:15:32,318--> 01:15:33,706
Playtime's over.

946
01:15:37,912--> 01:15:39,217
Michael?Michael?

947
01:15:41,642--> 01:15:43,084
Are you there?

948
01:15:43,428--> 01:15:47,378
Michael. is everything ok?

949
01:15:50,044--> 01:15:51,332
Yearp.

950
01:15:51,516--> 01:15:54,879
Sergeant Angel's been taken care of?
- Yearp.

951
01:15:55,184--> 01:15:57,732
he is not gonna get back up again?

952
01:16:00,255--> 01:16:02,815
Narp?

953
01:16:02,962--> 01:16:05,740
Good. proceed to the castle.

954
01:16:10,667--> 01:16:15,516
Frank, this shit just got real. Skinner just
sent someone to kill me. And 
now,now,he1s gone somewhere.

955
01:16:16,246--> 01:16:20,709
Um, up to the castle I think.I'm gonna 
go after him,ok? It is Nicholas by the way.

956
01:16:24,653--> 01:16:26,005
Oh my god.

957
01:16:26,263--> 01:16:30,541
What happened to your Peace Lilly?
- Danni,Danny, just stay here,Ok?

958
01:16:30,761--> 01:16:32,551
And watch him and call your
Dad. Tell him that I was right.

959
01:16:32,736--> 01:16:35,750
what you're gonna do?
- I'm gonna bust this thing wide open.

960
01:16:36,045--> 01:16:37,690
Nicholas wait.

961
01:16:39,262--> 01:16:42,845
You might need this.
- Thanks partner.

962
01:17:16,790--> 01:17:19,385
How could I possibly be 
in several places at once?


963
01:17:27,462--> 01:17:31,527
I just can't beleive that Leslie's dead.
How did it happen?

964
01:17:31,677--> 01:17:34,380
You will find that we run a very tight
shift here.

965
01:17:34,602--> 01:17:36,393
Who could do something like this?

966
01:17:36,578--> 01:17:40,013
It seems that Mr. Merchant tried
to have a little fry up and left
the gas on.

967
01:17:40,162--> 01:17:41,515
what a nasty way to go.

968
01:17:41,662--> 01:17:43,599
What happened Danni?
- No luck catching them killers?

969
01:17:45,171--> 01:17:48,241
"Fountain restoration completed
in 1993, with thanks to"

970
01:17:52,152--> 01:17:54,345
A quick announcement before we begin.

971
01:17:54,530--> 01:17:59,646
Janet Barker has decided to call her boys
Roger and Martin. And the christening will be...

972
01:17:59,831--> 01:18:04,729
a week, on Saturday, and
we are all  invited. Tom?

973
01:18:05,168--> 01:18:06,777
Thank You Joyce.

974
01:18:07,071--> 01:18:08,352
Now,

975
01:18:08,571--> 01:18:14,114
you'll all be delighted to hear
that the tenacious sergeant Angel
has been taken care of.  

976
01:18:15,299--> 01:18:20,562
Joyce will discover the Sergeant
laying on the wet floor on his 
bathroom,  

977
01:18:20,747--> 01:18:24,995
having slipped and 
tragically broken his neck.

978
01:18:25,223--> 01:18:29,684
So, with the dispatch of the Sergeant 
we would now be able to concentrate on
the eradication...

979
01:18:29,867--> 01:18:32,279
of our hoodie infestations.

980
01:18:32,465--> 01:18:36,048
Until which, nothing
will stand in our way.


981
01:18:36,195--> 01:18:41,920
Oh, I beg to differ Mr.Weaver.
- Well,well,well. I see we have visitors.

982
01:18:43,432--> 01:18:46,539
Sergeant Nicholas Angel.
Sandford Police service.

983
01:18:46,979--> 01:18:50,779
My, he is tenacious,isn't he?
- I'm arresting you under suspicion of ...

984
01:18:50,926--> 01:18:53,524
conspiracy to commit murder.

985
01:18:54,292--> 01:18:56,901
Oh, come,come sergeant.
-You should be ashamed.

986
01:18:57,086--> 01:19:00,887
Calling yourself a community that cares.
- But we do care Nicholas.

987
01:19:01,109--> 01:19:04,033
It's all about the greater good.
- The greater good.

988
01:19:04,219--> 01:19:06,888
How can this be for the greater good?
- The greater good.

989
01:19:07,327--> 01:19:11,384
You see, as much as enjoy your theory sergeant,
the truth is far less complex.

990
01:19:11,539--> 01:19:17,022
Blowers fate was simply the result of 
his being an appaling actor.

991
01:19:18,338--> 01:19:20,567
appaling.
- You murdered him for that?

992
01:19:22,252--> 01:19:24,665
well, he murdered Bill Shakespeare.
- What?

993
01:19:25,104--> 01:19:28,650
The dramatic society is an 
important feather in our  cap.

994
01:19:28,834--> 01:19:31,935
Couldn't let Blower jeopardized
that knowing we had 2 semiprofessionals 
waiting in the wings.

995
01:19:32,156--> 01:19:35,301
Let's not forget that Greg was
excellent in Strong Dogs,

996
01:19:35,448--> 01:19:38,351
and Shelly portrayed a cadaver in.. .
-Yes, I know.

997
01:19:38,498--> 01:19:44,420
Martin was less concerned with the 
reputation of the village,
then he was with his sordid
affaire with Eve Draper.  

998
01:19:44,714--> 01:19:48,514
And so Eve deserved to die too?
- She did have a very annoying laugh.

999
01:19:49,210--> 01:19:50,818
Annoying.
- And George Merchant?

1000
01:19:51,003--> 01:19:52,795
he had an awfull house.

1001
01:19:53,636--> 01:19:55,757
Awfull.
- We begged him in vain to make

1002
01:19:55,919--> 01:19:58,587
his residence more in keeping
with the village's rustic static.

1003
01:19:59,685--> 01:20:01,884
And what about Tim Messenger?
What was his crime?

1004
01:20:02,141--> 01:20:07,185
Tim Messenger 10 years editor of 
Sandford Citizen has been unbearable.

1005
01:20:07,384--> 01:20:11,259
Our once great paper,
have become riddled with tabloid
journalism.

1006
01:20:11,443--> 01:20:13,235
Not to mention persistent errors.

1007
01:20:13,421--> 01:20:16,710
He listed our ages 55,
when actually i am 53.

1008
01:20:17,674--> 01:20:20,855
What about Leslie Tiller one of your own,
her horticultural  expertise

1009
01:20:21,040--> 01:20:24,402
 helped put Sandford on the map.
- Oh she was ever so good.

1010
01:20:24,588--> 01:20:26,671
Cousin Leslie was a terrible shame.

1011
01:20:27,293--> 01:20:30,766
But it seems she was set on moving
away.

1012
01:20:30,951--> 01:20:34,313
We could not have her sharing our 
green fingers with anybody else. 

1013
01:20:34,499--> 01:20:38,856
Not least those  ?? in Buford Abbey.
If we can't have her, noone can. 

1014
01:20:39,078--> 01:20:41,673
How can this be for the greater good?
- The greater good.

1015
01:20:41,821--> 01:20:42,991
Shut it.

1016
01:20:43,140--> 01:20:45,625
These people died for no reason,
no reason whatsoever.

1017
01:20:46,102--> 01:20:48,660
Oh,I wouldn't say that.

1018
01:20:50,197--> 01:20:52,280
Hello Nicholas.

1019
01:20:52,844--> 01:20:55,294
I was like you once.

1020
01:20:55,478--> 01:20:59,025
I believed in the immutable
word of the law.

1021
01:20:59,245--> 01:21:03,192
That is until the night Mrs. Butterman
was taken from me.

1022
01:21:03,741--> 01:21:06,410
You see noone loved Sandford
more than her.

1023
01:21:06,595--> 01:21:10,176
She was head of the womens institute
chair of the floral comitee. 

1024
01:21:10,444--> 01:21:14,464
when they started the village of the 
year contest, she worked around the
clock.  

1025
01:21:14,720--> 01:21:17,682
I never seen such dedication.

1026
01:21:17,867--> 01:21:23,530
On the eve of the judicators arrival
some travellers moved into Callahan Park. 

1027
01:21:23,716--> 01:21:29,367
Before you could say gypsy scum, 
we were knee deep in dog mog
peeving kids and crusty jugglers


1028
01:21:29,770--> 01:21:31,868
Crusty jugglers.

1029
01:21:32,089--> 01:21:35,671
We lost the  title, and
Irene lost her mind.

1030
01:21:35,966--> 01:21:39,694
She drove her Daihatsu Cherry into Sandford
Gorge.

1031
01:21:40,061--> 01:21:45,128
That moment on, I swore that I would 
do her proud, and whatever the cost, 

1032
01:21:47,313--> 01:21:51,808
we would make Sandford great again.
- Sir. this doesn't make any sense.

1033
01:21:52,139--> 01:21:56,268
The judicators arrive tomorrow.
We had to get everything ready.

1034
01:21:56,453--> 01:21:59,268
You're saying this is all about
winning the best village award?

1035
01:21:59,418--> 01:22:01,466
This is the best village, Nicholas.

1036
01:22:01,649--> 01:22:05,595
You've seen the people,
they are happy. Contented.

1037
01:22:05,781--> 01:22:10,021
They're living in a dreamworld. 
- Sergeant Popwell thought much the same as you.

1038
01:22:10,205--> 01:22:12,019
I am disappointed you can't see
the bigger picture.

1039
01:22:12,167--> 01:22:16,517
Well, i am happy to disappoint you sir, and I am afraid
you're gonna have to come with me.

1040
01:22:16,665--> 01:22:20,686
You're all gonna have to come with me.
- No Nicholas.

1041
01:22:20,870--> 01:22:26,427
I'm afraid it is you, who is going to
have to come with us .

1042
01:22:33,406--> 01:22:35,453
Danni no.

1043
01:22:39,766--> 01:22:41,338
Back off,back off.

1044
01:22:41,487--> 01:22:45,470
Or I swear to God, you will be 
 ????a Danny ???coffin his head


1045
01:22:45,619--> 01:22:49,020
Come on Nicholas you haven't got any in you.
- I mean it.

1046
01:23:08,282--> 01:23:12,990
Gypsy scum, travelers,
lowbred boys.

1047
01:23:25,071--> 01:23:28,555
There has not been a recorded 
murder in Sandford in 20 years.

1048
01:23:33,015--> 01:23:35,207
Spot a bother up in Elroy farm.

1049
01:23:38,424--> 01:23:41,056
A great big bushy beard.

1050
01:23:59,217--> 01:24:02,288
Danni.

1051
01:24:36,809--> 01:24:39,990
What are you doing?
- Saving your skin.

1052
01:24:42,146--> 01:24:45,294
This is murder.
- It's not, It's ketchup.

1053
01:24:45,475--> 01:24:48,618
I 'm not talking about that, I am
talking about the others.
- What others?

1054
01:24:48,780--> 01:24:51,399
The others, the NWA have murdered.
- That's not true.

1055
01:24:51,547--> 01:24:55,622
It it is.
- Dad just said it was this special clubby.
I thought it was about rubbing people in the 
knuckles and ??? them on their way.

1056
01:24:57,705--> 01:25:01,433
There are skeletons back there.
- I don't know nothing about no skeletons.

1057
01:25:01,582--> 01:25:03,885
What did you think was happening?
- Not this.

1058
01:25:04,033--> 01:25:07,251
It's Frank he is appointing himself
judge, jury and executioner.

1059
01:25:07,397--> 01:25:12,405
He is not judge, jury and executioner.
- He is.You gotta help me take him down.

1060
01:25:12,604--> 01:25:14,761
I can't.

1061
01:25:14,909--> 01:25:17,841
He is my Dad.Take my car.

1062
01:25:18,682--> 01:25:20,356
Go back to London.

1063
01:25:20,466--> 01:25:23,465
There is nothing you can do.
- I can come back.

1064
01:25:23,539--> 01:25:27,576
I can come back and I can bring the blue furious
Metropolitan Police Service with me.

1065
01:25:27,725--> 01:25:33,426
And make it disappear? Who are they gonna believe?
My Dad or a looney London police officer?

1066
01:25:33,611--> 01:25:38,325
Then help me, we can
do it together. Your and me. Partners.

1067
01:25:39,130--> 01:25:42,764
Forget it Nicholas. It Is Sandford.

1068
01:26:18,274--> 01:26:20,066
"London. "

1069
01:26:33,478--> 01:26:35,201
Is that everything?

1070
01:26:42,607--> 01:26:43,744
Sir?

1071
01:26:44,691--> 01:26:45,898
Sir?

1072
01:26:47,339--> 01:26:49,838
Is there anything i can do for you?

1073
01:26:50,972--> 01:26:52,034
No.

1074
01:26:54,813--> 01:26:58,065
This is something that I have
that to do myself.

1075
01:27:11,907--> 01:27:14,700
"Welcome to Sandford. "

1076
01:27:22,848--> 01:27:27,089
Another beautiful day in God's country.

1077
01:27:34,033--> 01:27:35,679
Danni?

1078
01:27:44,486--> 01:27:45,876
It's...

1079
01:27:51,797--> 01:27:53,041
Mum.

1080
01:28:03,938--> 01:28:05,452
What are you gonna do?

1081
01:28:05,636--> 01:28:08,342
Just walk in and arrest the 
whole village?

1082
01:28:10,097--> 01:28:12,080
Not exactly.

1083
01:28:44,236--> 01:28:47,344
Sergeant Angel, someone from
London called for you.

1084
01:28:55,639--> 01:28:58,308
I'll tell them you'll ring her back.

1085
01:29:00,392--> 01:29:02,440
Well, that's funny?
-What's that?

1086
01:29:02,879--> 01:29:05,401
I didn't know we had 
a mounted division .

1087
01:29:05,551--> 01:29:07,560
Nobody tells me nothing.

1088
01:29:23,479--> 01:29:25,929
Wanna do something useful?

1089
01:29:35,987--> 01:29:39,607
Sergeant Angel's
back, check out his horse.

1090
01:29:40,815--> 01:29:42,934
Roger back???.

1091
01:29:44,069--> 01:29:45,399
It's...

1092
01:29:46,095--> 01:29:47,594
Angel.

1093
01:30:58,230--> 01:30:59,618
Morning.

1094
01:32:22,817--> 01:32:24,572
That's what I am talking about.

1095
01:32:39,736--> 01:32:42,083
still feel that you're missing out?

1096
01:33:08,717--> 01:33:10,001
Fascist.

1097
01:33:26,260--> 01:33:27,649
Hag.

1098
01:33:45,913--> 01:33:47,377
Stop.

1099
01:33:47,924--> 01:33:50,346
Stop this,please.

1100
01:33:50,640--> 01:33:53,893
You have to stop this
mindless violence.

1101
01:33:55,099--> 01:33:57,256
Nicholas my son,

1102
01:33:58,209--> 01:34:02,265
you may not be a man of God.
but surely you are a man of peace.

1103
01:34:02,449--> 01:34:07,275
I may not be a man of God,
reverend,but I know right and I know wrong.

1104
01:34:08,884--> 01:34:11,588
And I have the good grace
to know which is which.

1105
01:34:12,614--> 01:34:15,829
Oh, fuck off grasshopper.

1106
01:34:18,832--> 01:34:21,244
Jesus Christ. Nicholas?

1107
01:34:29,432--> 01:34:31,149
I thought you was a gonner.

1108
01:34:31,479--> 01:34:33,992
Drop your weapons.
- Dr. Patcher no.

1109
01:34:34,361--> 01:34:36,042
Shut up Danni.

1110
01:34:36,664--> 01:34:42,060
I brought you into this world, think
it's rather fitting, i should be the 
one to take you out of it.

1111
01:34:43,646--> 01:34:47,630
You and your interfeering little friend.

1112
01:34:53,331--> 01:34:55,351
Drop 'em.

1113
01:35:10,882--> 01:35:14,536
Your you are a Doctor. Deal with it.
- Yeah motherfucker.

1114
01:35:15,815--> 01:35:17,900
Danni let's roll.
-What are you thinking?

1115
01:35:20,568--> 01:35:22,225
Pub?

1116
01:36:24,040--> 01:36:28,134
Somebody call the police!
- Freeze.

1117
01:36:31,629--> 01:36:34,406
Officers. Arrest that man.

1118
01:36:34,592--> 01:36:38,027
Danni step away from the Sergeant.
- No Dad.

1119
01:36:38,212--> 01:36:40,479
Danni, you'll do as you're told.

1120
01:36:40,664--> 01:36:43,006
I'm not taking orders from you any more.

1121
01:36:43,480--> 01:36:46,782
Officers, arrest these men.
- Wait, wait.

1122
01:36:46,947--> 01:36:49,650
You can arrest us if you like, you can
throw us in prison and then go

1123
01:36:49,769--> 01:36:53,133
back to being blind submissive slaves,or you can be real 
Police Officers could help us 

1124
01:36:53,296--> 01:36:56,001
bring an end to this absurd history.
- what the fuck is he on about?

1125
01:36:56,222--> 01:36:59,403
Fuck are you on about?
- Have you ever wondered why

1126
01:36:59,585--> 01:37:02,805
the crime rate in Sandford is so low?
And yet the accident rate is so high?

1127
01:37:03,221--> 01:37:06,987
No. Yes. What?
- You've been brainwashed Tony.

1128
01:37:07,134--> 01:37:10,132
Brainwashed into deniality??? by an old man
with a murderous obsession.


1129
01:37:10,281--> 01:37:12,840
This is ridiculous.
- No, it's not Dad.

1130
01:37:13,506--> 01:37:18,477
It's very unridiculous. It's only now that i 
started to realize, how unridiculous it all is.

1131
01:37:18,663--> 01:37:20,271
Silence Danni.

1132
01:37:20,457--> 01:37:22,987
Think of your mother.
- Mum is dead, Dad.

1133
01:37:24,193--> 01:37:27,739
For the first time in my
life, you know i am glad

1134
01:37:27,923--> 01:37:33,613
if she could see what you've become
,then she would probably kill herself 
all over again.

1135
01:37:34,943--> 01:37:37,575
I am completely lost.
- Sandford is a lie Doris.

1136
01:37:37,869--> 01:37:41,093
For the last 20 years, the 
village has been controlled by Frank
and the NWA.


1137
01:37:41,278--> 01:37:44,786
They had  everyone to believe this is 
a perfect village, and kill anyone...

1138
01:37:44,971--> 01:37:47,106
who's threatened to change that.

1139
01:37:57,960--> 01:38:01,214
He says he reckons, you've got something there.
- I know.

1140
01:38:02,603--> 01:38:05,323
You're not seriously gonna believe
this man, are you?

1141
01:38:05,544--> 01:38:06,723
Are you?

1142
01:38:06,900--> 01:38:09,568
he is not even from around here!

1143
01:38:12,529--> 01:38:16,697
Maybe,it's time to give it up
Sir.

1144
01:38:19,145--> 01:38:22,439
You incompetent flat folks.

1145
01:38:30,160--> 01:38:32,755
Officer Walker, stay
here with Saxon and hold everything down.

1146
01:38:33,561--> 01:38:35,864
Officers, let's go.

1147
01:38:37,436--> 01:38:40,141
what about Dad?
- He'll come round again.

1148
01:38:40,289--> 01:38:42,425
want anything from the shop?

1149
01:38:59,425--> 01:39:01,693
What are you thinking of bro?
- We strike now, while we

1150
01:39:01,841--> 01:39:05,570
got the element of surprise,
we're gonna wait more time they got them mobilized. 
i say we go in through the front entrance

1151
01:39:05,754--> 01:39:08,642
take the place isle by isle.
They won't be expecting that.

1152
01:39:09,852--> 01:39:11,973
Very good. What he said.

1153
01:39:14,094--> 01:39:17,904
My,my, here come the fuzz.

1154
01:39:19,403--> 01:39:21,647
Who enters first?
- Wait here.

1155
01:39:22,050--> 01:39:25,218
Don't go in on your own.
- Don't worry, he knows what he is doing.

1156
01:39:29,094--> 01:39:30,266
They are in.

1157
01:39:30,449--> 01:39:33,191
You deal with the store,
I deal with the trolleyboy.

1158
01:39:43,277--> 01:39:46,348
Wait,wait,wait. Listen to me
,listen,listen.

1159
01:39:47,410--> 01:39:50,151
Is this what you really-really want?

1160
01:39:50,371--> 01:39:51,653
Yearp.

1161
01:39:52,019--> 01:39:53,738
Suit yourself.

1162
01:40:01,997--> 01:40:04,117
Go.Go,Go.

1163
01:40:20,332--> 01:40:21,905
.Andie!

1164
01:40:24,793--> 01:40:27,753
It'all right Andie, it's just ..naise.

1165
01:41:27,979--> 01:41:30,025
How's lurch?
- He is in the freezer.

1166
01:41:30,175--> 01:41:32,587
Did you say you "Cool off"?
- No, I didn't say anything actually.

1167
01:41:32,772--> 01:41:35,769
Shame.
- it was a bit earlier one that you missed

1168
01:41:35,954--> 01:41:39,081
when i distracted him with the cuddly monked
and then I said "playtime is over"


1169
01:41:39,229--> 01:41:42,126
Then i hit him with the peace lilly.
-You're fucking changed?.

1170
01:41:42,515--> 01:41:46,024
What's the situation?
- Two butchs and a fuck load of cutlery.

1171
01:41:46,208--> 01:41:47,746
What do you reckon?

1172
01:41:50,780--> 01:41:52,169
Idea.

1173
01:42:14,571--> 01:42:16,850
Yeah.
- Good work everyone.

1174
01:42:26,924--> 01:42:30,324
Nice work Doris.
- Nothing like a bit of girl on girl.

1175
01:42:33,322--> 01:42:34,931
Fruit attack.

1176
01:42:35,957--> 01:42:38,588
Can you handle this Sergeant Fisher?
We're gonna go up to the big boss.

1177
01:42:38,809--> 01:42:40,309
Allright Sergeant.

1178
01:42:41,186--> 01:42:42,795
Dani let's rock.
- Angel.

1179
01:42:42,908--> 01:42:46,452
Don't go being a twat.
- I won't give you the satisfaction.

1180
01:42:54,347--> 01:42:56,372
We should get down there.
-How?

1181
01:42:57,688--> 01:42:59,860
skip.

1182
01:43:04,334--> 01:43:07,442
Had some fun?
-fuck yeah.

1183
01:43:18,558--> 01:43:19,944
I'll drive.
- jump in.

1184
01:43:20,204--> 01:43:22,834
launch that shit.

1185
01:43:25,247--> 01:43:28,977
"Good luck Sandford. "

1186
01:44:13,698--> 01:44:15,198
Swan!

1187
01:44:34,123--> 01:44:35,477
swan!

1188
01:45:03,071--> 01:45:04,716
stay back.

1189
01:45:04,937--> 01:45:07,072
Or the gingernut gets it.

1190
01:45:08,791--> 01:45:10,693
You little fucker

1191
01:45:57,487--> 01:45:59,879
It's not your village any more.

1192
01:46:16,664--> 01:46:17,772
You did good, kid.

1193
01:46:18,249--> 01:46:19,602
Whats your name?
-aaron aronson

1194
01:46:20,956--> 01:46:22,455
Sorry?

1195
01:46:49,061--> 01:46:50,524
it's over  Danni.

1196
01:46:51,767--> 01:46:53,376
it's over.

1197
01:46:57,004--> 01:47:00,367
It really hurts.

1198
01:47:02,596--> 01:47:05,851
I'm gonna need some ice cream.

1199
01:47:07,862--> 01:47:10,640
Don't worry, there is plenty of
ice cream in the station.

1200
01:47:11,203--> 01:47:13,288
isn't that right Danny?
-Stay back.

1201
01:47:14,275--> 01:47:19,976
Finish it Frank you silly bastard.
- Not.We don't want any more blood shed.

1202
01:47:20,162--> 01:47:23,013
Frank, this whole thing started,
because you lost somebody you loved.

1203
01:47:23,161--> 01:47:24,954
Don't expect me to beleive,
you'll let it end the same way.

1204
01:47:25,101--> 01:47:26,931
I'll tell you how this is gonna end.

1205
01:48:09,897--> 01:48:12,140
I feel like I should say something
smart.

1206
01:48:12,289--> 01:48:15,323
You don't have to say anything at all.

1207
01:48:29,208--> 01:48:33,448
Now my perfect Summer,would begin with...

1208
01:48:39,821--> 01:48:42,000
What do you say Nicholas?
- We have been trying to reach you 

1209
01:48:42,148--> 01:48:44,986
for days.
- Yeah,well, I've been kind of busy.

1210
01:48:45,132--> 01:48:49,082
We need you back. The figures
have gone a little squiffy

1211
01:48:49,376--> 01:48:52,227
in your absence.
-come back to London. Sandford is 

1212
01:48:52,411--> 01:48:57,515
hardly a fitting place for 
such an exceptional officier.
- Yeah, well, the thing is..

1213
01:48:58,809--> 01:49:04,594
I kinda like it here. Besides 
we have to do a considerable 
amount of paper work.

1214
01:49:30,810--> 01:49:34,210
This is gonna take ages.
- Yeah, it'll take all night.

1215
01:49:34,615--> 01:49:38,743
But we've got the menpower, hey Andie?
-Well,Official Vocab Guideline,

1216
01:49:38,899--> 01:49:43,359
states we say staff and not
manpower, 'cause manpower's a
bit sexist.

1217
01:49:46,320--> 01:49:48,454
You don't mind a little menpower,
do you Doris?

1218
01:49:48,640--> 01:49:51,929
Oh,Dirty bastard.

1219
01:49:53,465--> 01:49:56,403
You cheeky fucker.

1220
01:50:04,195--> 01:50:06,317
Your you know what you are?

1221
01:50:06,980--> 01:50:09,827
A bloody busy mummy .

1222
01:50:14,140--> 01:50:15,968
.No!

1223
01:50:31,279--> 01:50:33,218
Oh God No.

1224
01:50:55,587--> 01:50:56,429
Danni.

1225
01:50:59,317--> 01:51:00,641
Danni.

1226
01:51:01,958--> 01:51:04,297
Oh God. Hold on Danny, just hold on.

1227
01:51:05,139--> 01:51:07,114
Hold on, it's gonna be fine.

1228
01:51:11,353--> 01:51:13,438
everything's gonna be fine.

1229
01:51:23,306--> 01:51:26,537
"one year later. "

1230
01:51:59,738--> 01:52:02,077
Hope these are okay.

1231
01:52:03,760--> 01:52:07,269
Yeah,they are lovely.

1232
01:52:12,020--> 01:52:15,091
"loving memory of
Irene Butterman "

1233
01:52:16,920--> 01:52:19,370
Any officers near the church?
-Go ahead Doris.

1234
01:52:19,882--> 01:52:24,327
Chief had a report about some
hippy messing with the recycling
bins at the supermarket. 

1235
01:52:24,513--> 01:52:26,049
Leave it with us.
- Received.

1236
01:52:26,270--> 01:52:27,843
Sergeant Butterman,

1237
01:52:28,071--> 01:52:32,941
Littlehand says it's time to Rock n Roll.
- Brings the noise.
