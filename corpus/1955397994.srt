the game in Afghanistan,

That's a big old closet. Wow!

694
00:45:47,779 --> 00:45:50,281
It looks like the closet
at our other house.

695
00:45:50,315 --> 00:45:53,718
Okay, yeah, this is a perfect

696
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,854
uh, computer room, right here.

697
00:46:22,513 --> 00:46:23,748
SOLDIER: Clear.

698
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,116
Insurgent shit.

699
00:46:36,928 --> 00:46:38,129
Hey, Timmy. What's up?

700
00:46:38,163 --> 00:46:40,165
Hey, come here real quick.

701
00:46:43,334 --> 00:46:45,937
(SOLDIER TALKING ON RADIO)

702
00:46:45,971 --> 00:46:47,405
Doesn't look that old.

703
00:46:47,438 --> 00:46:49,774
That's why we're here, man.

704
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:50,876
Hey, pull back.

705
00:46:50,909 --> 00:46:51,977
Pull back. Let's go back.

706
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:53,945
Secure these doors while we pull back.

707
00:46:53,979 --> 00:46:56,481
SOLDIER: I got it. I got it. I got it.

708
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:00,518
Are you okay?

709
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:04,289
Yeah, I just got something
shooting up my leg.

710
00:47:07,525 --> 00:47:09,260
(METALLIC GRATING)

711
00:47:14,966 --> 00:47:19,037
We haven't... Be careful.
...started any surgery or anything.

712
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:21,406
We're gonna try and let
it heal by itself.

713
00:47:21,439 --> 00:47:25,476
Hey, man. Look, see how my
butt's kind of gone, dude?

714
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:28,346
Yeah. Well, that's kind
of where it started.

715
00:47:28,379 --> 00:47:29,847
And then it goes down my leg.

716
00:47:29,881 --> 00:47:31,917
And you say this was a firefight?

717
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:33,251
I mean, we had been fighting like...

718
00:47:33,284 --> 00:47:34,819
That looks painful, man.

719
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:37,055
We had been fighting
for months and months,

720
00:47:37,088 --> 00:47:38,957
but, just at the very end,

721
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:40,926
I made it all the way
to the very end, dude.

722
00:47:40,959 --> 00:47:43,361
That was gonna be... I had one more...

723
00:47:43,394 --> 00:47:46,431
I had about one more
mission the very next day,

724
00:47:46,464 --> 00:47:48,533
then I would've been done, man.
I'd have been safe.

725
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,940
NATHAN: It's all the way up. There.

726
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:59,244
ASHLEY: Are you all right?

727
00:47:59,277 --> 00:48:01,046
I'm doing pretty bad, to be honest.

728
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:02,513
I can tell. All right.

729
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:04,182
I feel like I'm gonna be sick.

730
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:06,317
You gonna throw up? I might.

731
00:48:06,351 --> 00:48:07,618
Okay, I'm gonna put this in.

732
00:48:07,652 --> 00:48:08,886
Just need a minute.

733
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,521
Are you okay?

734
00:48:10,555 --> 00:48:12,157
Are you ready?

735
00:48:14,025 --> 00:48:15,360
Dude, I'm like out of it.

736
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:18,063
Do you just want to sit here? Mmm-mmm.

737
00:48:19,297 --> 00:48:22,300
NATHAN: I hear explosions. Are they...

738
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:25,503
Tell them we're getting
shot at from that wall.

739
00:48:25,536 --> 00:48:27,973
That wall. The tree line.

740
00:48:28,006 --> 00:48:29,975
(GUNFIRE) Hey!

741
00:48:30,008 --> 00:48:32,877
Hey, hey, hey, those rounds

742
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,146
are coming on the left side of the wall.

743
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:38,049
Firing the rounds... (INDISTINCT)

744
00:48:38,083 --> 00:48:40,318
Hey, that's also indirect, yeah.

745
00:48:42,453 --> 00:48:44,555
Yeah, but they can't come down the road.

746
00:48:44,589 --> 00:48:49,160
Get that mark and shoot
the middle of the wall.

747
00:48:49,194 --> 00:48:50,195
They're shooting from there

748
00:48:50,228 --> 00:48:51,662
and directly down the road.

749
00:48:51,696 --> 00:48:56,367
SOLDIER: Roger, that is deep
and they need to drop 2-0-0.

750
00:49:08,513 --> 00:49:09,647
NATHAN: When I was 18 years old,

751
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,250
all I wanted to do was kill people,

752
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:13,584
you know.

753
00:49:13,618 --> 00:49:15,553
They used to ask me when I
came into the Marine Corps,

754
00:49:15,586 --> 00:49:18,323
"Why did you come
into the Marine Corps?"

755
00:49:18,356 --> 00:49:21,226
"Why did you come into the
Marine Corps Infantry?"

756
00:49:21,259 --> 00:49:23,995
And I always told them,
"Because I wanna kill people."

757
00:49:24,029 --> 00:49:27,932
And they always said, "That's the
best answer I've ever heard."

758
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:31,702
That's all they want, that's
all they ever wanted.

759
00:49:31,736 --> 00:49:36,107
And, you know, I thought for
a long time that was cool.

760
00:49:36,141 --> 00:49:37,942
That's really what I wanted.

761
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:40,711
And, you know, that's
really the way I felt.

762
00:49:40,745 --> 00:49:42,447
You know, in my first two deployments,

763
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,981
I was kinda one of them guys

764
00:49:44,015 --> 00:49:47,152
that didn't really have
any fear whatsoever.

765
00:49:47,185 --> 00:49:49,054
You know, I was ready to go do it,

766
00:49:49,087 --> 00:49:52,323
I wanted to go fight, I
wanted to go kill the enemy,

767
00:49:52,357 --> 00:49:54,959
and be, you know, a roughneck,

768
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:59,064
and cuss and spit tobacco
and come home and do it again.

769
00:50:00,131 --> 00:50:02,033
I did that.

770
00:50:02,067 --> 00:50:04,735
I was just a young cowboy.

771
00:50:04,769 --> 00:50:07,238
And then this last time, you know,

772
00:50:07,272 --> 00:50:10,108
I had more concern
about it, you know, like,

773
00:50:10,141 --> 00:50:12,543
"I'm all for it, let's go do it."

774
00:50:12,577 --> 00:50:17,282
But, you know, I've already
done it, I've already done it,

775
00:50:17,315 --> 00:50:21,052
and it's not everything you
think it's going to be.

776
00:50:21,086 --> 00:50:23,188
And it's hard and it's tough,

777
00:50:24,289 --> 00:50:26,191
and it changes people,

778
00:50:26,224 --> 00:50:29,327
and here I am going to do it again.

779
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,529
All right, hold on.

780
00:50:31,562 --> 00:50:33,531
God, you're fighting me. I'm not.

781
00:50:33,564 --> 00:50:35,500
I'm leaning on the desk.

782
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:37,235
Sitting here, being still.

783
00:50:37,268 --> 00:50:39,104
(EXHALES) There we go.

784
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:43,408
NATHAN: But I've got to do it.

785
00:50:43,441 --> 00:50:47,412
I've got to fight to get home
to my wife and to my family.

786
00:50:47,445 --> 00:50:51,549
And also for my men and for our country.

787
00:50:51,582 --> 00:50:55,220
So, you know, still ready to go do it,

788
00:50:55,253 --> 00:51:00,425
but I've got a 26-year-old
head on me this time

789
00:51:00,458 --> 00:51:02,493
instead of an 18-year-old head on me.

790
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:05,563
You know, I just kind of grew up.

791
00:51:05,596 --> 00:51:07,698
I never done one of those. This...

792
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:09,334
Slides right over.

793
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:13,238
Just push it down to hold. That's it.

794
00:51:14,605 --> 00:51:16,207
Oh, the crew!

795
00:51:17,608 --> 00:51:19,277
(ALL LAUGHING)

796
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:22,647
Hey, man, how you doing?

797
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:23,814
Good to see you, stud.

798
00:51:23,848 --> 00:51:25,183
Thank you, sir, thank you.

799
00:51:25,216 --> 00:51:26,284
Good to see you.

800
00:51:26,317 --> 00:51:28,052
Good to see you.

801
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:29,387
SOLDIER 1: You're moving around again.

802
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,189
Oh, yeah. I got dressed somehow.

803
00:51:31,222 --> 00:51:33,224
SOLDIER 2: I like this. Look at that.

804
00:51:33,258 --> 00:51:34,725
My wife did it. It's a clip-on.

805
00:51:34,759 --> 00:51:35,826
(ALL LAUGHING)

806
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:37,094
SOLDIER 3: How you doing, sir?

807
00:51:37,128 --> 00:51:38,429
SOLDIER 4: It's good to
see you in good spirit.

808
00:51:38,463 --> 00:51:40,531
SOLDIER 5: Are you allowed to drink?
Or are you doped up so much...

809
00:51:40,565 --> 00:51:43,601
OxyContin, morphine, everything.

810
00:51:43,634 --> 00:51:46,771
It helps a lot, but it keeps me loopy.

811
00:51:46,804 --> 00:51:48,573
What they got it?
A big cast or something?

812
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:52,243
No, it's a metal titanium
rod that goes...

813
00:51:52,277 --> 00:51:54,612
That went... Since my hip's broken.

814
00:51:54,645 --> 00:51:57,582
My hip's broken, it took the
bone out where it meets...

815
00:51:57,615 --> 00:52:00,618
Where it meets my hip.

816
00:52:00,651 --> 00:52:02,520
So, like the bullet first hit,

817
00:52:02,553 --> 00:52:04,555
like, ripped my butt off.

818
00:52:04,589 --> 00:52:05,856
(SOLDIER LAUGHING)

819
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:07,358
And it went through... It's not funny.

820
00:52:07,392 --> 00:52:08,526
(ALL LAUGHING)

821
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:10,495
And then it went through
my hip right here.

822
00:52:10,528 --> 00:52:11,862
Broke my hip on the edge,

823
00:52:11,896 --> 00:52:15,233
so this is really messed up right here.

824
00:52:15,266 --> 00:52:16,334
It's nasty.

825
00:52:16,367 --> 00:52:18,369
And then it hit there and took that out

826
00:52:18,403 --> 00:52:20,705
and tumbled somehow and came
straight through my leg

827
00:52:20,738 --> 00:52:21,806
and came out right here.

828
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:25,676
So it snapped my leg. It was ridiculous.

829
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:26,844
It was ridiculous.

830
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:29,714
When we have time maybe later,
I'll tell the whole story.

831
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:35,820
Well, thank you.

832
00:52:39,324 --> 00:52:41,359
CHAPLAIN: Please be seated.

833
00:52:49,867 --> 00:52:53,204
Good afternoon. I'm
Chaplain Terry Roberts.

834
00:52:53,238 --> 00:52:55,273
I'm the battalion chaplain.

835
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:01,379
Today, we are here
to celebrate and honor

836
00:53:01,412 --> 00:53:04,515
the lives of our fallen heroes.

837
00:53:04,549 --> 00:53:06,417
We may be asking ourselves,

838
00:53:06,451 --> 00:53:08,453
"Why did this happen?"

839
00:53:08,486 --> 00:53:11,756
"Why did some return safely
while others did not?"

840
00:53:11,789 --> 00:53:12,857
(SNIFFLING)

841
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:14,359
Excuse me.

842
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:19,664
We may be looking for answers
to the unexplainable.

843
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:23,301
Sometimes, there just
isn't a right answer.

844
00:53:23,334 --> 00:53:27,171
Sometimes, there just isn't
the right word to say.

845
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:31,709
Some of us lost a fellow
Marine, a brother-in-arms.

846
00:53:31,742 --> 00:53:36,881
Some of us have lost a friend,
a cousin a nephew or an uncle.

847
00:53:38,683 --> 00:53:41,652
Some of us have lost
a husband, a father,

848
00:53:41,686 --> 00:53:44,855
a brother, a grandson,

849
00:53:44,889 --> 00:53:46,324
or a son.

850
00:53:48,859 --> 00:53:52,897
We all share in this great
loss, in different ways.

851
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:55,766
We cannot undo what is done,

852
00:53:57,568 --> 00:54:00,204
but how do we move on from here?

853
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:01,839
But move on we must.

854
00:54:03,908 --> 00:54:05,443

856
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:10,648
Excuse me.

(SNIFFLING)

858
00:54:29,934 --> 00:54:32,603
In Afghanistan, I carried with...

859
00:54:32,637 --> 00:54:33,904
Excuse me.

860
00:54:35,706 --> 00:54:36,974
(EXHALING)

861
00:54:43,514 --> 00:54:44,782
Excuse me.

862
00:54:50,855 --> 00:54:54,825
In Afghanistan, I carried
with me a Betsy...

863
00:54:57,962 --> 00:55:00,965
A Betsy Ross-style colonial flag.

864
00:55:08,873 --> 00:55:14,445
This flag bore a circle of
13 stars and 13 stripes.

865
00:55:16,847 --> 00:55:20,585
Now when I look at the
flag with the 13 stripes,

866
00:55:23,454 --> 00:55:26,557

want you telling the doctor

1047

it to something else.

What did I tell them?

1062
01:07:13,363 --> 01:07:14,764

to walk or run no more again.

01:16:07,263 --> 01:16:11,300
It's like I don't even see my husband.

1213
01:16:11,334 --> 01:16:13,536
It was almost like somebody
had taken over him,

1214
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:16,272
like, I'd look in his eyes
and it wouldn't even be him.

1215
01:16:16,305 --> 01:16:19,108
They were just soulless almost.

1216

I don't know if that makes any sense,

1217
01:16:23,112 --> 01:16:26,816
but he doesn't really become
anybody but just rage.

Did you say a month or so?

1221
01:16:33,322 --> 01:16:35,959
He got shot, October 23rd.

1222
01:16:35,992 --> 01:16:37,293
And has he completed his service,

1223
01:16:37,326 --> 01:16:38,995
or gonna go back later when he heals?

1224
01:16:39,028 --> 01:16:40,997
Actually, he was worried they
were gonna kick him out,

1225
01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:42,699
but they actually made a law now

1226
01:16:42,732 --> 01:16:44,968
if you get injured in combat,
they can't kick you out.

1227
01:16:45,001 --> 01:16:47,704
So, he's not dead. Well, good and bad.

1228

we can do for you tonight?

hard it is for me to walk,

1242

and for months I've tried.

1243
01:18:12,088 --> 01:18:15,058
I've walked without a
cane a couple of feet,

1244
01:18:15,091 --> 01:18:17,660
and fallen and gotten back up,

1245
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:20,797

fallen and gotten back up.

able to get to so good.

go back to Machine Gun Hill

around and move like that.

1250

That's just not gonna happen.

1251
01:18:39,849 --> 01:18:43,920
There's no way in hell that I could
go out there and do that again.

1252

right side of my body,

Run my hand along the
edge until I feel it,

1284
01:20:29,959 --> 01:20:32,161
and I pull it out,

1285

off safe and I'm ready.

1293
