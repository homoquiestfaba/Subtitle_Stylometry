00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:58,619
LEA (VOICEOVER): Dear
diary, the war, when

2
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,821
it came, lasted just a day.

3
00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:09,297
That's all it took.

4
00:02:09,397 --> 00:02:13,867
No one even knows who started
it or what it was all about.

5
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,336
But it was the
aftermath that took

6
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:18,606
its final toll on civilization.

7
00:02:18,706 --> 00:02:23,844
What was left of humanity began
to wipe itself out, finally,

8
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:26,814
rebelling against the conspiracy
of the capitalist elite

9
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:28,582
and the military establishment
that had resulted

10
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:30,017
in cataclysmic annihilation.

11
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:34,021
I was too little
to remember what

12
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:36,590
it was like before the war.

13
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,328
Mommy told me of great,
shining cities on a hill,

14
00:02:40,428 --> 00:02:43,931
and a thousand points of
light, and of a little house

15
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:49,002
they owned in a town
called Tromaville.

16
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,038
But that was in the past.

17
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:55,343
My childhood was a
brief, catatonic pause.

18
00:02:55,443 --> 00:03:02,650
Then, one day, I
woke up a woman.

19
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,818
I'm the daughter of a new age.

20
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:07,221
The radiation that
finished off humanity

21
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:09,923
has created ghastly mutations.

22
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,560
It's turned our
pets and livestock

23
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,797
into gargantuan,
horrifying creatures.

24
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:21,502
Now Tromaville has
become a dinosaur hell.

25
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:26,840
And to survive, I've
become a barbarian, but not

26
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,909
just any kind of barbarian.

27
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:32,813
Because sometimes my
juices start to flow

28
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:38,018
and I feel like a nymphoid.

29
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:41,789
And it's become harder
and harder and harder

30
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:46,059
than ever to find
a decent boyfriend.

31
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:54,668
So I guess you could say I've
become a nymphoid barbarian

32
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:55,469
in dinosaur hell!

33
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:31,665
[whimpering]

34
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:39,807
[thunk]

35
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:01,654
Bitch.

36
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:52,539
[screaming]

37
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:12,419
We have to go.

38
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:16,389
Where?

39
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:20,493
Three times we've
been attacked.

40
00:16:58,251 --> 00:16:58,951
Come on.

41
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:17,904
Wait.

42
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:18,705
Come on.

43
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:31,884
No.

44
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,386
Come on.

45
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:34,554
You go.
No.

46
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:35,555
- Oh, come on.
- No.

47
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:36,356
No.

48
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:08,915
[grunting]

49
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:40,199
Beware the Jabberwock, my
son, the jaws that bite,

50
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:43,602
the claws that catch.

51
00:26:43,703 --> 00:26:48,207
Beware the Jubjub bird, and
shun the frumious Bandersnatch.

52
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:55,481
He took his vorpal sword in
hand, long time the manxome foe

53
00:26:55,581 --> 00:27:00,152
he sought... so rested he
by the Tumtum the tree

54
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:03,923
and stood a while in thought.

55
00:27:04,023 --> 00:27:06,525
And, as in uffish
thought, he stood,

56
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,595
the Jabberwock,
with eyes aflame,

57
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:11,831
came whiffling through
the tulgey wood,

58
00:27:11,931 --> 00:27:15,367
and burbled as it came.

59
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,270
One, two, one, two, and
through and through,

60
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,039
the vorpal blade
went snicker-snack.

61
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:30,316
He left it dead, and with its
head, he went galumphing back.

62
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,521
He heareth not.

63
00:27:35,621 --> 00:27:36,889
He stirreth not.

64
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:37,690
He moveth not.

65
00:27:40,626 --> 00:27:43,830
The ape is dead.

66
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:46,198
Or mayhap not.

67
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:49,501
So you live after all, eh?

68
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:51,337
Ah well.

69
00:27:51,437 --> 00:27:56,042
Come to my arms, my beamish boy.

70
00:27:56,142 --> 00:27:57,109
A frabjous day!

71
00:27:57,209 --> 00:27:57,910
Callooh!

72
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,511
Callay!

73
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,981
He chortled in his joy.

74
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:29,041
Ah, so there is life in you yet.

75
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:30,509
Who are you?

76
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:31,844
By what name are you called?

77
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:35,347
Who are you?

78
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:45,792
An old man, a digger
of things that were.

79
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,201
Who's Lea?

80
00:29:01,307 --> 00:29:02,241
You mutter in your sleep.

81
00:29:06,846 --> 00:29:09,015
A woman.

82
00:29:09,115 --> 00:29:09,816
They took her.

83
00:29:12,852 --> 00:29:14,753
I've got to get her back.

84
00:29:14,854 --> 00:29:17,790
You're not rescuing anybody
just yet, old friend.

85
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:21,127
You just narrowly escaped the
gaping maw of death yourself.

86
00:29:21,227 --> 00:29:23,495
Get some sleep.

87
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:27,366
Come the morrow, you can regale
me with your tale of woe,

88
00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:30,036
you little chatterbox.

89
00:29:30,136 --> 00:29:31,070
Just get some sleep.

90
00:29:50,356 --> 00:29:51,690
Good lord, you
look fit for a man

91
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,360
who was half-dead last night.

92
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:58,164
You must have the most
incredible recuperative power.

93
00:29:58,264 --> 00:30:00,766
Off on a quest, eh?

94
00:30:00,867 --> 00:30:05,271
Still determined to
rescue your lady love?

95
00:30:05,371 --> 00:30:07,373
What was she like then?

96
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:08,841
Like?

97
00:30:08,941 --> 00:30:11,810
What was she like?

98
00:30:11,911 --> 00:30:13,312
Dark or fair?

99
00:30:13,412 --> 00:30:15,347
Tall or short?

100
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:17,583
Lean or stout?

101
00:30:17,683 --> 00:30:19,285
She was beautiful.

102
00:30:19,385 --> 00:30:23,055
Yes, I'm sure she was.

103
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:26,425
Look, far be it from
me to dissuade you

104
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:33,465
from this noble cause, but what
I mean to say is, by the time

105
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:39,105
you catch them, if you catch
them, what's the point, really?

106
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:45,411
I mean, all you can really
hope for is revenge.

107
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:49,048
And what's the point
in that, after all?

108
00:30:49,148 --> 00:30:49,848
I'm going.

109
00:30:49,949 --> 00:30:50,649
Thanks.

110
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:54,753
I certainly admire
your pigheadedness.

111
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:58,057
Come here.

112
00:31:06,765 --> 00:31:10,469
I have been places and
seen things your young eyes

113
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:11,703
wouldn't believe.

114
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:14,706
I'll tell you, this
world has known wonders

115
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:17,743
far beyond your imagining.

116
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:19,178
Like this.

117
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:24,350
Do you know what this is?

118
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:30,990
This is a weapon,
a powerful weapon.

119
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:33,459
Watch me carefully.

120
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,827
Hold it like this.

121
00:31:35,928 --> 00:31:38,965
This thing here's the trigger.

122
00:31:39,065 --> 00:31:40,799
You aim, Like a crossbow.

123
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:44,903
You squeeze the trigger.

124
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:58,350
Beats your swords and axes, eh?

125
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,151
Here.

126
00:32:01,988 --> 00:32:04,190
You'll need this if
you're to have any chance

127
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,458
of rescuing the lady fair.

128
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:08,460
But be careful.

129
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,963
I don't know how many
shots it has left.

130
00:32:11,063 --> 00:32:11,897
Don't waste them.

131
00:32:11,998 --> 00:32:13,165
Do you understand me?

132
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:27,946
Thank you.

133
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:28,914
Bye.

134
00:32:29,015 --> 00:32:29,715
Good luck.

135
00:32:41,827 --> 00:32:43,962
Just as well.

136
00:32:44,063 --> 00:32:46,032
I was tired of his
constant chatter.

137
00:39:09,648 --> 00:39:12,050
[roaring]

138
00:39:15,153 --> 00:39:17,523
[screaming]

139
00:43:54,499 --> 00:43:55,433
[inaudible].

140
00:43:55,533 --> 00:43:59,370
And then two more
came out of nowhere.

141
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,372
Four of them attacked us.

142
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:08,013
A tall man with scars and...
And three things with skin

143
00:44:08,113 --> 00:44:08,814
like lizards.

144
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:16,221
So they killed your friend.

145
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:22,794
He's not dead, but I
can't find my way back.

146
00:44:22,894 --> 00:44:23,594
Can you help me?

147
00:45:17,082 --> 00:45:19,517
Did you make that?

148
00:45:19,617 --> 00:45:21,386
No, I found it.

149
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,925
Where?

150
00:45:27,025 --> 00:45:30,495
I'll show you after
we... after we eat.

151
00:48:27,072 --> 00:48:28,473
[clang]

152
00:48:53,364 --> 00:48:54,065
Apple.

153
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:08,479
Round.

154
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:28,899
Food.

155
00:50:53,184 --> 00:50:54,252
You wanna see?

156
00:50:54,352 --> 00:50:55,052
Look.

157
00:50:55,153 --> 00:50:56,053
No.

158
00:50:56,154 --> 00:50:57,054
Take a good look.

159
00:51:03,628 --> 00:51:06,030
[shouting]

160
00:52:02,487 --> 00:52:04,054
I have to go.

161
00:52:04,155 --> 00:52:05,089
I have to find Marn.

162
00:52:08,226 --> 00:52:10,461
Marn.

163
00:52:10,561 --> 00:52:11,962
You belong to him.

164
00:52:18,603 --> 00:52:19,304
We'll find him.

165
00:52:54,872 --> 00:52:57,242
[growling]

166
00:53:53,798 --> 00:53:54,765
She's mine.

167
00:53:57,735 --> 00:53:58,436
Take her.

168
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:05,310
What are you waiting for?

169
01:02:45,129 --> 01:02:46,030
All right.

170
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:47,031
We'll do it here then.

171
01:03:38,048 --> 01:03:40,417
[screaming]

172
01:10:43,673 --> 01:10:44,574
Is there a girl?

173
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:50,580
Which way?

174
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:51,581
Which way did they take her?

175
01:11:54,744 --> 01:11:55,445
Marn?

176
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:02,118
You came.

177
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:38,422
Finally, before I kill you.

178
01:14:00,804 --> 01:14:01,505
The hell with you.

179
01:14:01,605 --> 01:14:02,305
You're lizard meat.

180
01:15:30,126 --> 01:15:32,461
Do what you want with her.
