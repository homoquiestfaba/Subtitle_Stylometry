1
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:01,161
Duckett! Answer your phone.

2
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:02,597
My messages are delivering,

3
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,364
so I know
you're fuckin' seeing 'em.

4
00:01:04,866 --> 00:01:06,266
Yo. Seen Duckett?

5
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,068
Uh, yeah, he's inside.
He's fucking off his head.

6
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:09,737
Bro, he's definitely
on something, eh?

7
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:13,541
Hey, is Duckett up there?

8
00:01:13,675 --> 00:01:15,977
Who the fuck
is Duckett?

9
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:24,819
Oi! Any of you seen Duckett?

10
00:01:24,953 --> 00:01:26,554
No, I haven't!

11
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,361
Oi. Oi, seen Duckett?

12
00:01:42,604 --> 00:01:44,338
Cole! Get your brother
under control.

13
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:47,207
-Where is he?
-He's in Jayden's room. Go.

14
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:51,546
Dude, what's your
brother's deal?

15
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:53,413
Duckett!

16
00:01:53,548 --> 00:01:55,182
Open the door, man!
I'm not screwing around.

17
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:57,351
Mate, I'm this close
to calling the cops.

18
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:59,386
Duckett, open the door
or I'll break it down.

19
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,656
What?

20
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:04,626
Dude, what the hell?

21
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:06,728
You're gonna break
my mum's door!

22
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:08,228
Nah, fuck this!

23
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:10,798
- Cole's breaking my fuckin'...
- Duckett.

24
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,602
Can you see them?
They're in here.

25
00:02:14,736 --> 00:02:16,938
I'm gonna take you home.
Okay, bro?

26
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:19,807
Pop said you're gonna
hurt a lot of people.

27
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:24,311
Pop's dead, Duckett.

28
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,215
You're not him.

29
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:29,784
What are you talking about?

30
00:02:32,654 --> 00:02:34,822
Bro, look at Duckett.
He's fucked!

31
00:02:34,956 --> 00:02:36,490
Are you serious?

32
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:38,793
Put your phones down!

33
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:42,162
Put your fuckin' phones away!

34
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:43,898
Hey, hey, bro...

35
00:02:44,032 --> 00:02:45,733
Everyone fuck off!

36
00:02:50,104 --> 00:02:52,573
It's a knife!

37
00:03:25,073 --> 00:03:27,207
<i>What are you doing?</i>

38
00:03:37,185 --> 00:03:41,122
<i>Get off me. Get off!</i>

39
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,024
<i>Mum!</i>

40
00:03:43,157 --> 00:03:44,357
Sorry.

41
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,460
No, I am.

42
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:48,629
I just needed a moment.

43
00:03:48,763 --> 00:03:50,665
Your aunty
wants to talk to you.

44
00:03:51,933 --> 00:03:53,300
Yeah, okay.

45
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:59,841
<i>I've still got</i>
<i>her name in Contacts.</i>

46
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:02,375
You know... I should...
I should take her out,

47
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,411
but I just can't do it.

48
00:04:05,947 --> 00:04:07,314
Yeah, me neither.

49
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,222
You thought about
what you're gonna do

50
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:15,857
when you finish school?

51
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,991
Hmm...

52
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,128
Work with your dad?

53
00:04:28,603 --> 00:04:29,971
You getting a cold, Mi?

54
00:04:31,906 --> 00:04:33,040
What?

55
00:04:33,174 --> 00:04:34,642
You getting a cold?

56
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,277
Uh, yeah, I think so.

57
00:04:43,251 --> 00:04:44,652
How was today for you?

58
00:04:44,786 --> 00:04:46,319
What?

59
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,990
How was today for you?

60
00:04:50,158 --> 00:04:51,324
Fine.

61
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,467
- Hey.
<i>- Hey, Mia.</i>

62
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:03,171
<i>-Can you come pick me up?</i>
-Oh, okay, now?

63
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,972
-Where'd you go?
-I was on the phone.

64
00:05:05,106 --> 00:05:07,241
My sister was meant
to be picking me up.

65
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:08,743
My fat mum's
meant to pick me up.

66
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:10,878
She's probably off
eating dick somewhere.

67
00:05:14,182 --> 00:05:15,348
Is that Alex?

68
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,618
Yeah, his Snapchats
are so cringe.

69
00:05:17,752 --> 00:05:19,787
He looks like my mum
in half of 'em.

70
00:05:19,921 --> 00:05:22,890
-He looks elvish.
-What's elvish?

71
00:05:23,024 --> 00:05:24,892
You know,
like the fantasy elves.

72
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:27,427
Shut up.

73
00:05:27,562 --> 00:05:29,630
I swear he stole
one of my cigarettes.

74
00:05:30,198 --> 00:05:31,699
You smoke now?

75
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,202
Nah, I just sell 'em. I sold,
like, two to him today.

76
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,369
He's such a tryhard.

77
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:38,639
He invited me
to his house to hang.

78
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:40,775
I thought you hated him.

79
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:42,109
Eh.

80
00:05:42,243 --> 00:05:44,512
Do you reckon they give you
cancer straightaway?

81
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:46,514
I don't know. Don't smoke it?

82
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:48,448
Don't tell me what to do.

83
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:52,820
Here you go.

84
00:05:56,891 --> 00:05:58,159
Nah.

85
00:05:58,292 --> 00:05:59,392
I hate the smell.

86
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:01,128
You're a fuckin' fetus.

87
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:03,931
I need a new best mate.

88
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:12,306
Riley!

89
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,674
You little feral. Cigarettes?

90
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:15,209
We weren't actually
smoking them.

91
00:06:15,343 --> 00:06:17,545
He's lying, Mia. He's already
had half a packet.

92
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:19,046
Need a lift anywhere?

93
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,715
Nah, Mum's gonna get
here soon. Thanks, though.

94
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:22,116
All right.
Well, just call Riley

95
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,718
-if she doesn't rock up.
-All right, thanks.

96
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:25,820
Yeah, and have fun
with your cancer.

97
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:29,090
See ya, Mia. See ya, fetus!

98
00:06:30,992 --> 00:06:35,162

Oh, shit.

110
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:20,041
- You poor thing.
- What do we do?

111
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:25,379
Do we call a vet?

112
00:07:25,513 --> 00:07:27,915
That's not gonna help, Riley.
I mean, look at it.

113
00:07:28,049 --> 00:07:30,318
Well, we can't just
leave it like that.

114
00:07:31,986 --> 00:07:33,587
Can you at least
put it out of its misery?

115
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:36,624
Okay.

116
00:08:03,184 --> 00:08:05,419
Mia, no,
we can't leave it like this.

117
00:08:05,553 --> 00:08:07,355
Another car will come.

118
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,023
Mia, it's crying.

119
00:08:38,152 --> 00:08:39,253
Oh!

120
00:08:39,387 --> 00:08:40,821
Hey!

121
00:08:40,955 --> 00:08:42,256
What the hell? Love it
when you rock up uninvited.

122
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,425
Love it when you forget
to pick up Riley.

123
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:45,926
Ow!

124
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,862
I'm sorry. I had you on mute.

125
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:49,563
Ah, cool story.
I'm telling Mum.

126
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:51,732
- No, you're not!
- Yes, I am!

127
00:08:53,401 --> 00:08:54,635
Thanks for picking him up, Mi.

128
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:56,704
All good. Come on, Cookie.

129
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:58,272
Oh, God, you stink!

130
00:08:58,406 --> 00:09:00,608
Oh, you're a smelly girl!

131
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:16,891
Saw a dying kangaroo.

132
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:18,159
What?

133
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:21,862
On the side of the road.
It was in so much pain.

134
00:09:21,996 --> 00:09:24,065
Why didn't you call the RSPCA?

135
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:26,600
I dunno.

136
00:09:27,435 --> 00:09:29,103
It was almost dead.

137
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,639
I wanted to put it
out of its misery.

138
00:09:37,111 --> 00:09:39,013
Thanks for ignoring my calls,
by the way.

139
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:41,949
I haven't been ignoring
your calls. I've been busy.

140
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,018
Uh, yeah, busy ignoring me.

141
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:48,189
-No, Jade, don't. Don't!
-What?

142
00:09:48,322 --> 00:09:50,658
Don't answer it!
I let a kangaroo suffer.

143
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,793
-Daniel...
-I need consoling!

144
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:55,129
<i>Is that Mia?</i>

145
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,331
-I'll call you back, yeah?
<i>-Okay, sure.</i>

146
00:09:57,465 --> 00:09:58,567
Okay, bye.

147
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:00,835
Bye! Bye, Daniel! Bye!

148
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:04,038
Oh! All right.
I'm consoling you.

149
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:06,807
Have you seen the group chat?

150
00:10:06,941 --> 00:10:08,309
You mean the one
I invited you to?

151
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:09,544
It's Hayley's video.

152
00:10:09,677 --> 00:10:10,845
They're doing it
again tonight.

153
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:12,713
-No, Mia.
-I want to see if it's real!

154
00:10:12,847 --> 00:10:14,849
No, not tonight, Mia. I can't.

155
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:23,824
It was Mum's two years.

156
00:10:24,992 --> 00:10:26,360
That was today?

157
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,029
Yeah.

158
00:10:30,865 --> 00:10:32,766
I just want to
forget about it.

159
00:10:34,536 --> 00:10:36,170
And...

160
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,839
I need Daniel to come give
my gucci some attention.

161
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:43,844
Oh! Daniel's not touching
your gucci, Mia!

162
00:10:43,978 --> 00:10:45,913
Hey, he was my boyfriend
before he was yours.

163
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:47,848
You guys held hands
once three years ago.

164
00:10:47,982 --> 00:10:50,684
-That doesn't mean anything.
-Jade.

165
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:54,088
It's my mum's remembrance day.
Please?

166
00:10:59,594 --> 00:11:01,630
Daniel can come, too, yeah?

167
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:03,964
If he's touching
my gucci, yes.

168
00:11:04,098 --> 00:11:05,466
Stop!

169
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:09,303
Can you give me five minutes?

170
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:11,005
What am I gonna do
for five minutes?

171
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:13,107
Oh, I don't know.
Wash Cookie or something!

172
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,242
I don't wanna
wash Cookie!

173
00:11:15,376 --> 00:11:18,812
Oh, fine! I will babysit
Riley, the better sibling.

174
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:21,081
Do not talk about your gucci
with Riley, please.

175
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,184
He has got to learn!
The boy's got to learn!

176
00:11:23,317 --> 00:11:25,486
-Bye.
-Miss you already. Bye.

177
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,688
Love you.

178
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:43,871
"Can I help?"

179
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:46,307
"Yes, Riley,
thank you for asking."

180
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,151
Need a hand?

181
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:59,787
I'm sorry I couldn't get to
your mum's thing.

182
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,388
I couldn't get off work.

183
00:12:01,523 --> 00:12:02,856
No, it's fine.

184
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,358
How's your dad?

185
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:07,529
Oh, hey...

186
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:09,830
You can be honest.

187
00:12:09,964 --> 00:12:11,966
I hate being around him.

188
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:13,834
He's so depressing.

189
00:12:15,002 --> 00:12:17,338
I'm a bad person, Sue.
Can you fix me?

190
00:12:18,607 --> 00:12:20,307
You're not broken, Mia.

191
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:23,344
Whoa. Okay.

192
00:12:23,477 --> 00:12:25,145
Ugh, God, I'm dying.

193
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,281
It's just a cold.
You'll kick it.

194
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:28,882
Thank you.

195
00:12:29,016 --> 00:12:31,318
Riley, get your shit
off the table.

196
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:35,022
Did you hear me?

197
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:37,559
- Yes, Mum, I'm coming.
- Okay.

198
00:12:47,636 --> 00:12:49,903
Mum? You going to bed?

199
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:52,473
-You sneaking out?
-Why do you always think

200
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,408
I'm sneaking out
or I'm sleeping around?

201
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:55,943
Because you only ask
if I'm going to bed

202
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:57,378
when you're sneaking out.

203
00:12:57,512 --> 00:12:58,846
Is it to see Daniel?

204
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:02,149
You know, even if it was,
he's ultra-Christian.

205
00:13:02,283 --> 00:13:05,919
-He doesn't do anything ever.
-He's still got a dick, Jade.

206
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:07,454
Is it him
you're sneaking out to see?

207
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:09,189
I'm not sneaking out!

208
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,258
Okay.

209
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,428
God. Night.

210
00:13:16,397 --> 00:13:17,931
Lock the door on your way out.

211
00:13:19,768 --> 00:13:21,503
-Are we sneaking out now?
-Shh!

212
00:13:21,636 --> 00:13:22,903
- Bye, Mia.
- Oh, God!

213
00:13:23,037 --> 00:13:24,572
I didn't tell on you.

214
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,308
What? I didn't do anything.

215
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:31,845
What are you doing?

216
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:33,947
Mia said I could come.

217
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:35,650
How could I say no to him?

218
00:13:35,784 --> 00:13:37,184
You're not coming.

219
00:13:37,318 --> 00:13:38,620
All right, then,
I'll tell Mum.

220
00:13:38,753 --> 00:13:40,220
Yeah, well, she pretty much
already knows.

221
00:13:40,354 --> 00:13:42,256
What, about you
not picking me up?

222
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:46,827
Whatever.

223
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:52,066
Yo, check this out.

224
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:53,934
-I swear it's fake.
-Mm, I don't know.

225
00:13:54,068 --> 00:13:55,737
It's 1,000% a trick.

226
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:58,038
How would Hayley
fake that? Why would they?

227
00:13:58,172 --> 00:13:59,774
Why would they?
They're an attention whore.

228
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:01,475
They're trying to get everyone
to go to their house

229
00:14:01,609 --> 00:14:03,410
and talk about them
and you've fallen for it.

230
00:14:03,545 --> 00:14:05,513
Sorry for ruining
your phone date.

231
00:14:05,647 --> 00:14:06,980
Apology not accepted.

232
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:08,482
You're gonna be pregnant
by next month, I swear.

233
00:14:08,616 --> 00:14:11,553
Pregnant?
He hasn't even kissed me yet.

234
00:14:11,686 --> 00:14:14,522
What? You guys have been going
out for, like, three months.

235
00:14:14,656 --> 00:14:16,957
-What is that?
-Even I've kissed Jazzie.

236
00:14:17,091 --> 00:14:19,193
The girl
with the horse mouth?

237
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:21,061
You shouldn't be kissing
horses, Riley.

00:15:03,638 --> 00:15:05,005
Cool.

256
00:15:12,814 --> 00:15:15,015
Sick house, Joss.

257
00:15:15,784 --> 00:15:16,984
Yeah.

258
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:19,386
Oh... Nah, it'll pick up soon,
I'm sure.

259
00:15:21,656 --> 00:15:22,590
How you doin', man?

260
00:15:30,698 --> 00:15:31,965
Boop!

261
00:15:32,867 --> 00:15:33,868
You all good?

262
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:35,537
Yeah, just...

263
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:37,705
being weird.

264
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,441
You're not being weird.
You just need to loosen up.

265
00:15:40,842 --> 00:15:42,242
Brr!

266
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:43,912
Yeah, just do that.
It looks incredibly normal.

267
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:45,212
Brr!

268
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:47,047
Just do that. Brr!

269
00:15:47,181 --> 00:15:49,517
- Hey, Mia, brr!
- Fuck, I love you.

270
00:15:49,651 --> 00:15:51,753
-Jade!
-Daniel!

271
00:15:51,886 --> 00:15:53,120
Finally.

272
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:55,757
Um, hi, ex-boyfriend!

273
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,092
- Group hug.
- Hold me, ex-boyfriend.

274
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:02,196
I am lonely.
I am so, so lonely!

275
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:03,865
You right there, woman?

276
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:05,332
I'm sorry
for dragging you out.

277
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:07,234
Nah. I wasn't doing anything.

278
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:08,969
I actually wanted to get
out of the house for a bit.

279
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:11,472
Wanna come grab a drink?

280
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,576
I don't wanna do it.

281
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:16,945
-They want you to do it.
-I don't wanna do it.

282
00:16:19,948 --> 00:16:21,148
How you been?

283
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:23,718
Dude, why'd you
have to bring her?

284
00:16:23,852 --> 00:16:24,985
How you going, man?

285
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:26,888
-Good. You?
-Yeah, good, thanks.

286
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,423
First, uh, big boys' party,
huh?

287
00:16:29,557 --> 00:16:30,925
I don't really
know anyone.

288
00:16:31,058 --> 00:16:32,025
You're gonna
know everyone

289
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,293
by the end of the night.

290
00:16:33,427 --> 00:16:34,361
Oh, good.

291
00:16:34,495 --> 00:16:36,029
-She's fine.
-No, she's not fine.

292
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:37,464
She irritates
the fuck out of me.

293
00:16:37,599 --> 00:16:39,132
She's literally done nothing
to you.

294
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:42,169
She's so clingy, man.
It's fucking depressing.

295
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:46,173
Oh! Now she's flirting
with your boy.

296
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,009
They're friends, Hayley.

297
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:50,678
You keep
telling yourself that.

298
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:53,848
All right, let's do this!

299
00:16:56,584 --> 00:16:58,418
Yeah,
let's fake another video.

300
00:16:59,787 --> 00:17:01,455
Oh, I've been waiting
for this shit!

301
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,762
Be pretty sick
to hook the kid up.

302
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:10,464
He's not doing anything, Joss.

303
00:17:10,598 --> 00:17:12,867
Ah, come on, Jade.
Imagine it, though.

304
00:17:13,001 --> 00:17:14,167
Joss, I said no.

305
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:16,771
All right. More for me.

306
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,507
Thank you so much.

307
00:17:19,641 --> 00:17:21,408
I guess, uh,
I'll go first and...

308
00:17:21,543 --> 00:17:23,076
Nah, man,
you always go first.

309
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,212
- Well, it's my house.
- It's my fuckin' hand.

310
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:26,548
Duckett gave it to me.

311
00:17:26,681 --> 00:17:28,248
Joss,
you're a fucking hog!

312
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:30,484
Look, does anyone else
want to volunteer?

313
00:17:30,618 --> 00:17:31,686
I'll do it.

314
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:38,091
- You wanna do it?
- Mm-hmm.

315
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:39,861
-Wanna do it?
-Yeah.

316
00:17:40,862 --> 00:17:43,397
Do you wanna do it?

317
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:50,304
Sit down, Mia.

318
00:17:51,639 --> 00:17:54,141
- Better her than me.
- Tie her.

319
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:56,076
Yes, sir. Hands up.

320
00:17:58,846 --> 00:18:00,380
Mm, kinky.

321
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:03,450
What are we playing?

322
00:18:03,585 --> 00:18:06,253
It's nothing, Riley.
Hayley's tricked everyone.

323
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:08,155
All right,
somebody time it.

324
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:09,456
As soon as she lets it in,

325
00:18:09,591 --> 00:18:11,258
it cannot go
for more than 90 seconds.

326
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:12,392
Am I clear?

327
00:18:12,527 --> 00:18:14,596
What happens after 90 seconds?

328
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,832
They'll want to stay.

329
00:18:19,701 --> 00:18:21,502
And if you die
while they're in you,

330
00:18:21,636 --> 00:18:24,806
well, they'll have you
forever.

331
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:28,442
So lame.

332
00:18:28,576 --> 00:18:30,177
Hey, I'm just relaying
what I've been told, okay?

333
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,445
Oh! Fuck, dude!

334
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:34,649
Trust me...
It's gotta be tight.

335
00:18:36,985 --> 00:18:38,251
Candles?

336
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:41,254
Light the candle
to open the door.

337
00:18:41,388 --> 00:18:43,290
Blow it out to close it.

338
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:50,765
Okay, Mia.

339
00:18:57,872 --> 00:18:59,239
Ah...

340
00:19:00,508 --> 00:19:01,876
Put your hand on it.

341
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,915
No, like, hold it.

342
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,655
Now say...

343
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:15,657
"Talk to me."

344
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:18,726
Talk to me.

345
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:24,464
Oh, my God!

346
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:26,266
Oh, my God, what the fuck?

347
00:19:28,903 --> 00:19:30,705
Who the fuck was that?

348
00:19:30,838 --> 00:19:32,040
Who was that?

349
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:33,708
I dunno, man. It's different
every time.

350
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:35,810
- Hey, you signed up.
- Where'd he go?

351
00:19:35,943 --> 00:19:37,679
Mia, stop.

352
00:19:37,812 --> 00:19:40,180
No, you didn't do it right.
You gotta say, "I let you in."

353
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:41,281
No, I'm flipping out.

354
00:19:41,415 --> 00:19:42,717
Seriously, Mia, shut up.

355
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,919
No, someone was sitting there,
I swear to fuck.

356
00:19:48,255 --> 00:19:50,158
Okay, I'm proving it.

357
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,358
Attagirl, prove it!

358
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:52,794
Prove it.
That's right, say it.

359
00:19:56,396 --> 00:19:58,866
Do it. Do it.

360
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,735
Do it. Do it.

361
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:03,303
Do it.

362
00:20:03,437 --> 00:20:07,041
Do it! Do it!
Do it! Do it! Do it!

363
00:20:11,946 --> 00:20:15,215
Okay! Okay. Okay.

364
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:19,721
Talk to me.

365
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:23,691
Hey, hey,
don't let go, Mia.

366
00:20:23,825 --> 00:20:25,626
-Do not let go.
-I can't look at it!

367
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,061
You don't have to look at it!
You don't have to look at it!

368
00:20:27,195 --> 00:20:28,196
-Just say it.
-I can't!

369
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:29,530
Say it!

370
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,870
I let you in.
I let you in.

371
00:20:37,939 --> 00:20:38,940
I let you in.

372
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:46,647
- Someone timing it?
- Got it.

373
00:20:52,053 --> 00:20:53,420
There you are.

374
00:20:53,554 --> 00:20:55,455
Shh. Shh-shh-shh-shh.

375
00:21:31,092 --> 00:21:33,995
There he is.

376
00:21:44,739 --> 00:21:47,474
They like you.

377
00:21:50,044 --> 00:21:50,978
What?

378
00:21:52,345 --> 00:21:53,881
Oh, shit! Not you, though.

379
00:22:00,087 --> 00:22:02,890
Whoa.

380
00:22:18,506 --> 00:22:19,874
Yeah, Mia!

381
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:22,910
He's behind you now.

382
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:28,448
He'll split ya, pretty boy.

383
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:29,851
He'll split ya!

384
00:22:29,984 --> 00:22:32,086
83 seconds.
Joss, get it off her.

385
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,554
He'll split ya!

386
00:22:33,688 --> 00:22:35,422
-All right, you've had enough.
-He'll split ya.

387
00:22:35,556 --> 00:22:38,358
He'll split ya.
He'll split ya.

388
00:22:41,229 --> 00:22:42,930
Run. Run.

389
00:22:43,064 --> 00:22:45,700
Run. Run. Run.

390
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:46,801
Run. Run.

391
00:22:46,934 --> 00:22:50,605
Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run!

392
00:22:50,738 --> 00:22:53,473
-Run! Run! Run! Run! Run!
-90 seconds, for fuck sake!

393
00:22:53,608 --> 00:22:57,311
Run! Run! Run! Run!
Run! Run! Run! Run!

394
00:22:57,444 --> 00:22:59,479
Run! Run! Run! Run! Run!

395
00:22:59,614 --> 00:23:01,749
Run!

396
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:05,753
Hey. Hey. You okay?

397
00:23:06,354 --> 00:23:07,822
We went a bit over.

398
00:23:07,955 --> 00:23:08,923
Hey.

399
00:23:18,099 --> 00:23:19,901
That was...

400
00:23:21,168 --> 00:23:23,137
amazing!

401
00:23:26,641 --> 00:23:28,408
That was the best one yet!

402
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:27,835
Jade.
Jade, are you up?

403
00:24:27,969 --> 00:24:29,704
You're not sleeping in here.

404
00:24:30,604 --> 00:24:32,206
I didn't even ask that.

405
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,674
Isn't that what you want?

406
00:24:34,342 --> 00:24:36,210
No. I'm just bored.

407
00:24:37,345 --> 00:24:39,513
Look, Riley, you're not nine
anymore, all right?

408
00:24:43,584 --> 00:24:44,819
Goodnight.

409
00:24:48,389 --> 00:24:49,657
Can you shut the door?

410
00:24:51,325 --> 00:24:53,027
Shut the door!

411
00:24:55,863 --> 00:24:58,599
Sook!

412
00:25:04,438 --> 00:25:05,973
What a bitch.

413
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:09,076
Can I hang with you?

414
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,745
It's your house, bro.

415
00:25:22,957 --> 00:25:25,259
Did the hand thing scare you?

416
00:25:27,461 --> 00:25:28,729
A bit.

417
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:32,900
You gonna have nightmares,
Riley?

418
00:25:34,402 --> 00:25:36,103
I don't get nightmares.

419
00:25:38,406 --> 00:25:39,774
I do.

420
00:25:41,342 --> 00:25:42,777
Like what?

421
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,782
I have this
reoccurring nightmare...

422
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:50,751
where...

423
00:25:50,885 --> 00:25:53,954
I'm looking in the mirror
and my reflection is gone.

424
00:25:55,322 --> 00:25:57,191
Like I don't exist.

425
00:26:02,763 --> 00:26:04,899
What did the hand feel like?

426
00:26:07,601 --> 00:26:08,969
Hmm...

427
00:26:09,837 --> 00:26:11,739
It felt amazing.

428
00:26:13,574 --> 00:26:15,943
I felt like I was glowing.

429
00:26:17,711 --> 00:26:21,982
I could hear and see
and feel everything.

430
00:26:22,983 --> 00:26:25,719
But I was
in the passenger seat.

431
00:26:27,721 --> 00:26:29,623
It felt incredible.

432
00:26:31,425 --> 00:26:32,793
Hmm.

433
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,731
How did your mum die?

434
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:43,137
You know.

435
00:26:44,305 --> 00:26:45,840
Only bits.

436
00:26:50,778 --> 00:26:52,146
She, uh...

437
00:26:54,448 --> 00:26:56,717
took too many sleeping pills.

438
00:26:56,851 --> 00:26:58,385
By accident.

439
00:27:01,222 --> 00:27:03,924
Dad was sleeping on the couch.

440
00:27:05,326 --> 00:27:07,995
In the morning,
he couldn't open the door.

441
00:27:10,431 --> 00:27:11,799
Hmm.

442
00:27:13,334 --> 00:27:14,702
Why?

443
00:27:16,637 --> 00:27:18,939
Mum was on the other side.

444
00:27:21,175 --> 00:27:22,910
And there were scratches
on the door

445
00:27:23,043 --> 00:27:24,945
and wood under her nails.

446
00:27:27,148 --> 00:27:29,650
She tried to get help,
but she couldn't.

447
00:27:34,589 --> 00:27:37,958
Jade said
you got depression after.

448
00:27:41,061 --> 00:27:43,130
I was just feeling alone.

449
00:27:44,765 --> 00:27:46,200
No, you can't ever be alone

450
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:48,135
'cause you'll always have
me and Jade.

451
00:27:50,204 --> 00:27:51,405
Yeah.

452
00:27:52,373 --> 00:27:55,109
It's okay,
I don't feel alone anymore.

453
00:28:13,827 --> 00:28:16,096
<i>Wait. Oh, my God...</i>

454
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:18,633
<i>-Is it being constipated?</i>
<i>-Are you fuckin'...</i>

455
00:28:18,766 --> 00:28:20,201
<i>He's won a million pounds!</i>

456
00:28:51,165 --> 00:28:54,201
-You busy tonight?
-You want a turn, eh?

457
00:28:54,735 --> 00:28:56,270
No. Daniel does.

458
00:28:57,404 --> 00:28:58,405
What's in it for me?

459
00:28:59,541 --> 00:29:00,841
My company.

460
00:29:00,975 --> 00:29:03,143
That's pretty cool, I reckon.

461
00:29:03,277 --> 00:29:04,646
No, we can't go to Joss's.

462
00:29:04,778 --> 00:29:05,913
His place is trashed.
He's pissed.

463
00:29:06,514 --> 00:29:07,982
My house, then.

464
00:29:08,115 --> 00:29:09,950
I've got a party later.
I've gotta be gone by 11:00.

465
00:29:10,084 --> 00:29:12,820
- Mum leaves at 9:00, so...
- See ya at 10:00.

466
00:29:14,522 --> 00:29:15,889
Jog on.

467
00:29:22,263 --> 00:29:23,732
- Yes?
- Yes!

468
00:29:27,067 --> 00:29:29,336
Hi. Is Jade home?

469
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:38,713
-Why is Daniel at the door?
-Mum, can you let him in?

470
00:29:38,846 --> 00:29:41,815
You'd better not be having
a party, Jade, I swear to God.

471
00:29:41,949 --> 00:29:43,784
It's two friends.
Can you let him in?

472
00:29:49,557 --> 00:29:50,958
What time's
everyone getting here?

473
00:29:51,091 --> 00:29:53,528
-Getting here for what?
-The party.

474
00:29:53,662 --> 00:29:56,698
-Is there a party tonight?
-Don't bullshit me.

475
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:57,965
I'm... I'm sorry...

476
00:29:58,098 --> 00:29:59,233
Have you got alcohol
in your car?

477
00:29:59,366 --> 00:30:01,435
Oh, no. I don't drink, so...

478
00:30:02,704 --> 00:30:04,071
You're good.

479
00:30:10,377 --> 00:30:12,012
What time's the party again?

480
00:30:12,146 --> 00:30:13,947
- What party?
- The party.

481
00:30:14,081 --> 00:30:15,550
Jade told me. It's okay.
What time?

482
00:30:15,684 --> 00:30:17,719
Mum, I honestly don't know
what you're talking about.

483
00:30:17,851 --> 00:30:19,386
The party tonight.
What time is it?

484
00:30:19,521 --> 00:30:21,055
There's no party, Mum.

485
00:30:23,157 --> 00:30:24,793
You are not drinking tonight.

486
00:30:24,925 --> 00:30:27,394
On God,
I will punch you in the face.

487
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:28,862
Are you drunk?

488
00:30:28,996 --> 00:30:30,431
James.

489
00:30:30,565 --> 00:30:32,433
If there's a party,
I'm definitely drinking at it.

490
00:30:34,335 --> 00:30:37,237
Is that Cookie or you, James?
Will you crack a window?

491
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:41,909
Jesus, Mum. Knock much?

492
00:30:42,042 --> 00:30:43,844
Mia, if there is
a party tonight,

493
00:30:43,977 --> 00:30:45,446
you are banned
from this house,

494
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,980
effective immediately.

495
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,217
Okay...

496
00:30:51,051 --> 00:30:52,219
So, what, you're just here

497
00:30:52,353 --> 00:30:53,822
third-wheeling for the night,
are you?

498
00:30:53,987 --> 00:30:56,123
Well, it's really humiliating
when you put it that way.

499
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:58,760
You'd better not be getting
stoned again, Mia.

500
00:30:58,892 --> 00:31:01,362
Oh, my God! Why does your mum
have to know everything?

501
00:31:01,495 --> 00:31:04,632
- I know everything.
- I tried weed one time.

502
00:31:04,766 --> 00:31:05,966
You.

503
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,602
My daughter's vagina...
prohibited.

504
00:31:07,736 --> 00:31:10,304
Oh, my God, Mum! Leave the
room before I kill everyone.

505
00:31:10,437 --> 00:31:12,239
The neighbors
tell me everything.

506
00:31:12,373 --> 00:31:14,007
- Oh, my God...
- Watch it!

507
00:31:14,141 --> 00:31:15,777
Shut the door. Mum!

508
00:31:15,909 --> 00:31:17,645
I'm leaving it open!

509
00:31:17,779 --> 00:31:19,113
I'm so sorry.

510
00:31:19,246 --> 00:31:20,715
Ooh. That's embarrassing.

- Mia!
- Mm! You keen?

519
00:31:36,397 --> 00:31:37,832
I said don't smoke
in my house.

520
00:31:37,965 --> 00:31:39,066
Mm!

521
00:31:42,637 --> 00:31:44,572
Hmm... Nice place.

522
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:47,007
That's an ugly fuckin' dog.

523
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:48,676
Excuse me.

524
00:31:50,177 --> 00:31:51,912
I'm thirsty.

525
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:08,061
So, where'd you get it from,
anyway?

526
00:32:08,195 --> 00:32:09,363
I'll tell you
what it is, right?

527
00:32:09,496 --> 00:32:10,964
It's the hand of a psychic.

528
00:32:11,098 --> 00:32:13,033
Got cut off and embalmed.
Legit.

529
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:14,968
It's a medium, Joss.
Not a psychic.

530
00:32:15,102 --> 00:32:16,704
Yeah, this isn't
an embalmed hand.

531
00:32:16,838 --> 00:32:18,172
Yes, it is, Danny boy.

532
00:32:18,305 --> 00:32:20,374
See, look. The ceramic shit
is put over it.

533
00:32:20,508 --> 00:32:23,143
But if you smash it, there's
an actual hand in there.

534
00:32:23,277 --> 00:32:25,547
- You're full of shit.
- I'm serious.

535
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,080
Apparently, it was
the hand of someone

536
00:32:27,214 --> 00:32:28,348
who could connect
with the dead, right,

537
00:32:28,482 --> 00:32:29,684
so everyone
around him thought,

538
00:32:29,818 --> 00:32:31,051
let's just cut his hand off.

539
00:32:31,185 --> 00:32:32,486
White people shit, man,
I tell ya.

540
00:32:33,855 --> 00:32:35,623
Oi, I heard it was
the hand of a Satanist.

541
00:32:35,757 --> 00:32:39,059
The other hand's
just out there somewhere.

542
00:32:39,193 --> 00:32:40,795
Out where?

543
00:32:40,929 --> 00:32:42,262
Shut up, all right?

544
00:32:42,396 --> 00:32:44,965
- Fuckin' make me!
- You just talk shit.

545
00:32:45,533 --> 00:32:46,901
All right.

546
00:32:47,034 --> 00:32:48,068
Where'd you buy it?

547
00:32:48,202 --> 00:32:49,470
Oh, nah,
I didn't buy it.

548
00:32:49,604 --> 00:32:51,371
A friend gave it to a friend
and... yeah.

549
00:32:51,506 --> 00:32:53,808
-Who?
-What do you want, Daniel?

550
00:32:53,942 --> 00:32:55,042
You want a fuckin' spreadsheet

551
00:32:55,175 --> 00:32:56,310
with a transaction history
or what?

552
00:32:56,443 --> 00:32:57,946
Just hold the hand,
say "Talk to me"

553
00:32:58,078 --> 00:33:00,582
and ask the spirit your
fuckin' questions, all right?

554
00:33:00,715 --> 00:33:02,650
This is such bullshit.

555
00:33:02,784 --> 00:33:04,318
Oi, Riley, get the lights.

556
00:33:06,186 --> 00:33:08,055
Film me?

557
00:33:08,188 --> 00:33:10,057
- Yep.
- Oi, time it.

558
00:33:11,291 --> 00:33:14,094
Okay, champ.

559
00:33:15,062 --> 00:33:16,598
You know the drill.

560
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:21,068
Say it.

561
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:26,006
Talk to me.

562
00:33:26,139 --> 00:33:27,775
Whoa!

563
00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:29,611
Oh, what?

564
00:33:29,744 --> 00:33:31,211
No way!

565
00:33:31,345 --> 00:33:33,615
-Mate, I don't have all day.
-No. No...

566
00:33:33,748 --> 00:33:34,849
What is it?

567
00:33:36,718 --> 00:33:38,452
Okay. Okay.

568
00:33:38,953 --> 00:33:39,988
Okay.

569
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,823
Okay, come on.

570
00:33:41,956 --> 00:33:43,056
Okay, come on.

571
00:33:48,295 --> 00:33:49,731
I let you in.

572
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:58,840
Hayley, he's choking.

573
00:33:58,973 --> 00:34:00,340
Hold it.

574
00:34:02,577 --> 00:34:04,746
Hayley, fucking stop it,
he's choking!

575
00:34:04,879 --> 00:34:05,880
Hold it.

576
00:34:11,451 --> 00:34:13,588
There we go.

577
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,468
He hates it
when you touch him.

578
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,141
You make him soft.

579
00:34:38,278 --> 00:34:40,515
Yo, this spirit's a cunt.

580
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:12,547
Oh, fuck!

581
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,781
Oh, shit.

582
00:35:28,096 --> 00:35:29,363
Oh!

583
00:35:32,033 --> 00:35:35,637
Oh, no! I can't watch!

584
00:35:46,848 --> 00:35:48,549
- Oh, fuck!
- You okay?

585
00:35:48,683 --> 00:35:50,018
Untie me.

586
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:52,185
Untie me, come on.

587
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:53,921
I am, I am. You all right?

588
00:35:56,223 --> 00:35:57,491
Delete it.

589
00:35:57,625 --> 00:35:59,192
Delete it, come on!

590
00:35:59,326 --> 00:36:00,460
Yeah, nuh!

591
00:36:00,595 --> 00:36:02,063
Hayley, please. Hayley...

592
00:36:02,195 --> 00:36:03,296
Post that shit.

593
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:04,732
Post that shit.

594
00:36:04,866 --> 00:36:06,366
Daniel.

595
00:36:11,673 --> 00:36:12,674
Guys.

596
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:18,079
Oh, yeah, that was, uh...
That was pretty heavy, eh?

597
00:36:18,211 --> 00:36:20,247
Yeah. You up for it?

598
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,217
Can I have a go?

599
00:36:24,351 --> 00:36:25,887
- Sorry...
- After that?

600
00:36:27,689 --> 00:36:31,759
Just get your thot dog out
and no cameras.

601
00:36:47,842 --> 00:36:49,744
Hey!

602
00:36:53,014 --> 00:36:54,816
Let's fucking go!

603
00:37:07,294 --> 00:37:08,896
Mia! Mia!

604
00:37:25,278 --> 00:37:26,379
Time's up, time's up!

00:37:54,976 --> 00:37:56,343
What the fuck?

612
00:38:04,852 --> 00:38:07,588
Oh, fuck, yeah.
This shit never gets old.

613
00:38:08,321 --> 00:38:10,525
Let's go!

614
00:38:10,658 --> 00:38:11,859
- I need a shot.
- Me, too.

615
00:38:11,993 --> 00:38:13,995
- No way.
- Come on, Jade.

616
00:38:14,128 --> 00:38:15,763
You're not my mum.
You're not even 18.

617
00:38:15,897 --> 00:38:17,231
And you're not even 15.

618
00:38:17,364 --> 00:38:18,633
So what?

619
00:38:18,766 --> 00:38:20,968
- Jade, please.
- Riley, I said no.

620
00:38:24,404 --> 00:38:26,507
Fuck sakes.

621
00:38:26,641 --> 00:38:29,277
What if we did it
for, like, 60 seconds?

622
00:38:29,409 --> 00:38:31,746
-Mia, stop.
-60 seconds, Jade.

623
00:38:31,879 --> 00:38:33,848
You don't have to be a bitch
about all things Riley.

624
00:38:34,715 --> 00:38:36,150
Yeah, Jade.

625
00:38:36,284 --> 00:38:37,785
You're just so busy
trying to suck Daniel's dick,

626
00:38:37,919 --> 00:38:39,520
you don't give a shit
about anybody else.

627
00:38:39,654 --> 00:38:41,022
- Damn.
- Okay, no.

628
00:38:41,155 --> 00:38:44,424
Why do you want to do it
so much? To impress James?

629
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:46,294
To come into my room
crying that you're scared

630
00:38:46,426 --> 00:38:47,628
like last time?

631
00:38:48,629 --> 00:38:50,430
Did you tell
your little friend that?

632
00:38:52,967 --> 00:38:54,802
I hate you.

633
00:38:54,936 --> 00:38:57,437
Like you're my favorite
person in the world.

634
00:39:00,808 --> 00:39:03,811
Can't help you, bro.
Your sister's fuckin' boring.

635
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,417
Oh, shit, oh...

636
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,322
-We should go.
-Yeah.

637
00:39:14,454 --> 00:39:16,991
60 seconds. Please.

638
00:39:17,124 --> 00:39:19,193
I dunno,
maybe it's not a good idea.

639
00:39:19,327 --> 00:39:22,495
I actually thought you were
gonna be on my side for once.

640
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,732
Hey... I'm on both
of your sides.

641
00:39:24,866 --> 00:39:26,499
-Obviously not.
-Riley...

642
00:39:26,634 --> 00:39:28,501
Sixty seconds. Please.

643
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,709
Please.

644
00:39:35,543 --> 00:39:36,811
Okay.

645
00:39:37,578 --> 00:39:38,880
What about 50?

646
00:39:39,013 --> 00:39:40,413
Okay. 50.

647
00:39:41,549 --> 00:39:42,917
Fifty seconds?

648
00:39:44,752 --> 00:39:46,687
-Yeah, just get it over with.
-Sign the form, baby!

649
00:39:46,821 --> 00:39:49,323
- Let's go!
- Yeah, boy!

650
00:39:49,456 --> 00:39:50,825
Okay, hold up, hold up.

651
00:39:52,326 --> 00:39:53,527
Hands up.

652
00:39:54,494 --> 00:39:55,897
You all right, kiddo?

653
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,198
Yeah.

654
00:39:57,331 --> 00:39:59,667
Okay. Let's do this.

655
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,537
Riley... gettin' crazy!

656
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:06,439
You know what to say, boy.

657
00:40:11,712 --> 00:40:13,514
You better not cry
after 20 seconds.

658
00:40:13,648 --> 00:40:15,016
I'll time it.

659
00:40:17,551 --> 00:40:18,920
Talk to me.

660
00:40:23,423 --> 00:40:24,959
What the fuck?

661
00:40:27,194 --> 00:40:28,262
Riley.

662
00:40:28,629 --> 00:40:29,997
It's okay.

663
00:40:32,465 --> 00:40:33,834
Just say it.

664
00:40:43,544 --> 00:40:44,477
I let you in.

665
00:40:47,381 --> 00:40:49,317
Oh, shit.

666
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:05,132
I'm so sorry.

667
00:41:09,437 --> 00:41:11,973
I didn't mean to hurt you.

668
00:41:16,978 --> 00:41:19,479
I'd never want to hurt you.

669
00:41:20,648 --> 00:41:22,783
I miss you so...

670
00:41:23,517 --> 00:41:25,586
so much, Mi.

671
00:41:30,858 --> 00:41:33,761
I don't want you to hate me.

672
00:41:36,464 --> 00:41:37,665
Mum?

673
00:41:38,498 --> 00:41:39,667
Hey, that's 50 seconds.

674
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,035
No, no.
Please don't close it off.

675
00:41:41,168 --> 00:41:43,004
- Mia...
- It's my mum. Please.

676
00:41:44,739 --> 00:41:47,274
I love you both, baby.

677
00:41:49,477 --> 00:41:51,112
I love you, too, Mum.

678
00:41:51,245 --> 00:41:54,348
I'm so proud of you.

679
00:41:58,652 --> 00:42:00,488
And I got...

680
00:42:00,621 --> 00:42:03,391
got... got... got...

681
00:42:03,524 --> 00:42:07,128
...got, got, got...

682
00:42:07,261 --> 00:42:09,597
got, got, got, got,

683
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:12,500
got, got, got, got...

684
00:42:23,577 --> 00:42:24,845
Oh, my God.

685
00:42:30,584 --> 00:42:32,086
No! No, no, Riley!

686
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:34,889
Riley, stop!

687
00:42:35,923 --> 00:42:37,725
Joss, fucking help me!

688
00:42:37,858 --> 00:42:39,493
Get it off him, Joss!

689
00:42:43,664 --> 00:42:45,032
Oh, my God.

690
00:42:51,272 --> 00:42:53,007
Riley! Riley!

691
00:42:56,243 --> 00:42:57,311
Fucking help me!

692
00:42:57,445 --> 00:42:59,246
Oi, help, help, help!

693
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,848
Okay, I'm gonna untie him...

694
00:43:00,981 --> 00:43:02,450
Get him on his side...

695
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:03,918
Daniel,
call an ambulance!

696
00:43:04,051 --> 00:43:05,853
No, no, no,
no, no, no!

697
00:43:12,093 --> 00:43:14,028
James, James,
get the fuckin' bag! Hurry up!

698
00:43:25,507 --> 00:43:27,341
- Where are you going?
- We gotta bounce.

699
00:43:27,475 --> 00:43:28,676
No, we can't bounce.

700
00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:30,344
We've gotta get
out of here.

701
00:43:30,478 --> 00:43:31,645
The police are already suss
about the Duckett stabbing.

702
00:43:31,779 --> 00:43:32,880
They're gonna pin this on us.

703
00:43:33,013 --> 00:43:34,281
We let them both
do the hand, Joss.

704
00:43:34,415 --> 00:43:35,449
We can't just pretend
we weren't here.

705
00:43:35,584 --> 00:43:36,884
We're fucked.

706
00:43:37,017 --> 00:43:38,319
We're fucked if...

707
00:43:38,452 --> 00:43:39,954
We just gotta get
our story straight

708
00:43:40,087 --> 00:43:40,888
and make sure everyone
sticks to it, all right?

709
00:43:41,021 --> 00:43:42,456
Don't bring up the hand.

710
00:44:21,962 --> 00:44:24,698
Excuse me.
We need to talk now, please.

711
00:44:33,874 --> 00:44:35,743
<i>Mum, Riley's in hospital.</i>

712
00:44:35,876 --> 00:44:37,211
<i>What?</i>
<i>What happened?</i>

713
00:44:37,344 --> 00:44:39,079
<i>He smashed</i>
<i>his face really bad.</i>

714
00:44:39,213 --> 00:44:40,915
<i>What are you</i>
<i>talking about,</i>

715
00:44:41,048 --> 00:44:42,349
<i>"smashed his face"?</i>
<i>How did he smash his face?</i>

716
00:44:42,483 --> 00:44:44,018
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

717
00:44:44,151 --> 00:44:45,753
<i>I don't know,</i>
<i>I wasn't in the room!</i>

718
00:44:45,886 --> 00:44:47,821
<i>Stop crying</i>
<i>and tell me what happened.</i>

719
00:44:47,955 --> 00:44:50,858
- Three or four minutes, maybe?
<i>- I'm sorry, Mum.</i>

720
00:44:50,991 --> 00:44:53,994
<i>Jade!</i>
<i>Jade, frickin' answer me!</i>

721
00:45:08,142 --> 00:45:09,777
Can we talk about this?

722
00:45:10,545 --> 00:45:11,613
Mia.

723
00:45:11,745 --> 00:45:13,714
Dad, I just want
to go to sleep.

724
00:45:14,882 --> 00:45:16,784
Can you tell me one thing?

725
00:45:17,851 --> 00:45:19,453
We didn't give him anything.

726
00:45:20,054 --> 00:45:21,789
What happened, then?

727
00:45:23,857 --> 00:45:25,226
I dunno.

728
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,463
I wish you'd just
be honest with me.

729
00:45:29,598 --> 00:45:32,866
Right, because you've been
so honest with me.

730
00:45:33,702 --> 00:45:36,003
What's that supposed to mean?

731
00:45:36,136 --> 00:45:38,872
It means there's something
you haven't told me about Mum.

732
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:41,108
Isn't there?

733
00:45:46,715 --> 00:45:47,982
Right.

734
00:47:00,921 --> 00:47:02,189
Tell me he's okay.

735
00:47:02,323 --> 00:47:03,692
No offence, I don't want
you here right now.

736
00:47:03,824 --> 00:47:06,460
Wait, Jade. Come on.

737
00:47:09,531 --> 00:47:10,598
Mia.

738
00:47:19,774 --> 00:47:20,709
Sue, I...

739
00:47:20,841 --> 00:47:22,109
Don't!

740
00:47:24,211 --> 00:47:25,479
What are you doing here?

741
00:47:25,613 --> 00:47:28,048
I just... I just came to see
how he was.

742
00:47:28,182 --> 00:47:31,352
He's bad, Mia.
He's really fucking bad.

743
00:47:31,485 --> 00:47:33,555
-Did you give him something?
-No.

744
00:47:33,688 --> 00:47:35,956
Come on. I know you've done
shit before. What was it?

745
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:37,858
Nothing, I swear.

746
00:47:38,992 --> 00:47:40,961
Look at his face.

747
00:47:41,095 --> 00:47:43,297
What did my son
ever do to you?

748
00:47:44,298 --> 00:47:46,033
I... I didn't hurt him.

749
00:47:46,166 --> 00:47:47,401
Go home. Now.

750
00:47:47,535 --> 00:47:49,103
No, please,
can I just see him?

751
00:47:49,236 --> 00:47:51,706
You come back here,
I'm gonna call the police.

752
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,107
Sue...

753
00:47:55,442 --> 00:47:57,211
-Jade.
-Just go home.

754
00:47:57,344 --> 00:47:59,547
No, Jade, I'm so sorry...

755
00:48:23,337 --> 00:48:25,139
Mi...

756
00:49:19,794 --> 00:49:20,795
Mum?

757
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:23,865
Mum, is that you?

758
00:49:25,667 --> 00:49:26,901
- Help me!
- Mum?

759
00:49:27,034 --> 00:49:28,168
Mum?

760
00:49:28,302 --> 00:49:30,505
Mum?

761
00:49:30,638 --> 00:49:33,307
- Mum!
- Mia!

762
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:51,058
Mia.

763
00:49:51,191 --> 00:49:53,026
What's wrong?

764
00:49:56,598 --> 00:49:57,765
Are you okay?

765
00:50:21,154 --> 00:50:22,456
Was your dad pissed?

766
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:24,726
Yeah.

767
00:50:24,859 --> 00:50:28,696
I'm 18, so the police
didn't call mine.

768
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:31,031
They can't know.

769
00:50:33,467 --> 00:50:35,369
Where do they think
you are?

770
00:50:36,704 --> 00:50:37,772
Cousin's.

771
00:50:39,574 --> 00:50:41,241
I can't go home.

772
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:43,110
They'll know something's up.

773
00:50:46,246 --> 00:50:48,148
You can stay at mine.

774
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,695
Just 'cause of me and Jade.

775
00:51:00,828 --> 00:51:02,095
It might be...

776
00:51:02,897 --> 00:51:04,164
weird.

777
00:51:04,966 --> 00:51:06,233
Yeah, but...

778
00:51:07,467 --> 00:51:08,703
we're just friends.

779
00:51:08,836 --> 00:51:11,104
It's not like it's illegal
or anything.

780
00:51:16,511 --> 00:51:17,779
I just...

781
00:51:17,912 --> 00:51:19,614
I don't want to be alone.

782
00:51:23,417 --> 00:51:24,686
Okay.

783
00:51:31,291 --> 00:51:33,728
I can't believe
I spoke to her.

784
00:51:33,861 --> 00:51:35,863
I don't think
that was your mum, Mia.

785
00:51:35,997 --> 00:51:38,198
No, it was at first.

786
00:51:39,366 --> 00:51:40,802
She used to call me "Mi"
all the time.

787
00:51:40,935 --> 00:51:43,004
I mean, how would the spirits
know that?

788
00:51:44,038 --> 00:51:46,507
I feel like they read
what we think. You know?

789
00:51:46,641 --> 00:51:47,642
I mean...

790
00:51:48,977 --> 00:51:50,310
they were in us.

791
00:51:51,378 --> 00:51:53,280
They could know
everything about us.

792
00:51:55,984 --> 00:51:57,785
Or maybe...

793
00:51:57,919 --> 00:52:00,655
Mum was there because
she was trying to reach out.

794
00:52:05,827 --> 00:52:06,961
We could check.

795
00:52:07,461 --> 00:52:08,428
No.

796
00:52:08,563 --> 00:52:10,464
I'm never doing it again, Mia.

797
00:52:12,634 --> 00:52:13,701
Sorry.

798
00:52:22,977 --> 00:52:25,178
Forgot about that.

799
00:52:25,312 --> 00:52:28,215
-I was such a loser.
-You were cute.

800
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:30,585
Remember when we held hands?

801
00:52:30,718 --> 00:52:31,719
Yeah.

802
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:34,088
I could feel
your heart beating

803
00:52:34,221 --> 00:52:35,790
through your fingertips.

804
00:52:35,923 --> 00:52:37,125
Yeah, you paid me out

805
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:38,593
'cause your hands
were bigger than mine.

806
00:52:38,726 --> 00:52:40,528
- And they probably still are.
- No way.

807
00:52:45,399 --> 00:52:47,902
It is.
You have the tiniest hands.

808
00:52:48,903 --> 00:52:51,806
Yeah, I...
I didn't do puberty right.

809
00:54:08,116 --> 00:54:09,784
<i>No, wait, Jade, Jade...</i>

810
00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:30,071
<i>Mum.</i>

811
00:54:30,204 --> 00:54:32,439
<i>What's your message</i>
<i>to the haters?</i>

812
00:54:33,406 --> 00:54:36,144
<i>Suck my arse! Mm-hmm!</i>

813
00:54:36,276 --> 00:54:37,879
<i>Mum!</i>

814
00:54:38,012 --> 00:54:40,280
<i>Get off me. Get off!</i>

815
00:54:43,117 --> 00:54:44,317
<i>Who's the cutest?</i>

816
00:54:44,451 --> 00:54:46,587
<i>- Me. Me.</i>
<i>- Me.</i>

817
00:54:46,721 --> 00:54:48,823
<i>-Who's the hottest?</i>
<i>-Me.</i>

818
00:54:48,956 --> 00:54:50,423
<i>- Who's the best?</i>
<i>- Me!</i>

819
00:54:50,558 --> 00:54:51,826
<i>- Who's the funniest?</i>
<i>- Me.</i>

820
00:54:51,959 --> 00:54:53,961
<i>You suck!</i>

821
00:54:54,095 --> 00:54:55,863
<i>You suck!</i>

822
00:54:55,997 --> 00:54:57,064
<i>Fuck the haters!</i>

823
00:56:57,285 --> 00:56:59,921
Please...
No. No, Rhea...

824
00:57:00,721 --> 00:57:02,957
Rhea...

825
00:58:31,979 --> 00:58:33,147
Daniel?

826
00:58:36,684 --> 00:58:39,954
Daniel! Daniel, wake up!

827
00:58:40,888 --> 00:58:43,024
Daniel, wake up!

828
00:58:43,691 --> 00:58:46,160
Daniel!

829
00:58:46,293 --> 00:58:48,929
Wake up!

830
00:58:50,731 --> 00:58:52,633
Oh, what the... Mia!

831
00:58:52,767 --> 00:58:54,235
Stop!

832
00:58:56,003 --> 00:58:59,940
Where is she?
Oh, my God, oh, my God!

833
00:59:00,841 --> 00:59:02,043
Oh, my God, they followed us.

834
00:59:02,176 --> 00:59:03,911
Whoever we contacted,
they followed us.

835
00:59:04,045 --> 00:59:05,646
-What are you talking about?
-She was sucking your foot!

836
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:07,648
You were sucking my feet, Mia.
You had my foot in your mouth!

837
00:59:07,782 --> 00:59:09,050
What? No, I didn't.

838
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:10,818
-I'm gonna go.
-Wait, Daniel...

839
00:59:10,951 --> 00:59:12,286
-Mia, stop!
-No, don't leave me!

840
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:14,755
- No, I'm going.
- Stay with me.

841
01:00:08,577 --> 01:00:10,778
Mum?

842
01:00:17,818 --> 01:00:20,187
Please, please, Mum.

843
01:00:22,256 --> 01:00:23,624
Talk to me.

844
01:00:35,236 --> 01:00:36,403
Mum.

845
01:00:48,182 --> 01:00:49,350
Did you...

846
01:00:50,851 --> 01:00:52,920
Did you kill yourself?

847
01:00:55,422 --> 01:00:56,924
No.

848
01:00:57,057 --> 01:00:59,260
Not on purpose, Mi.

849
01:01:01,395 --> 01:01:02,997
Is that the truth?

850
01:01:04,633 --> 01:01:07,268
I'd never want to leave you.

851
01:01:07,835 --> 01:01:09,203
Ever.

852
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:13,073
I'm here.

853
01:01:14,675 --> 01:01:16,210
Always.

854
01:01:24,952 --> 01:01:26,320
Mia.

855
01:01:28,022 --> 01:01:30,391
Riley needs help.

856
01:02:28,182 --> 01:02:31,085
Oh, your father. Unbelievable.

857
01:02:31,218 --> 01:02:33,521
Can you stay
with him, Jade?

858
01:02:46,967 --> 01:02:48,335
Riley.

859
01:02:50,271 --> 01:02:52,473
Riley, please say something.

860
01:02:56,745 --> 01:02:58,112
Riley?

861
01:02:59,947 --> 01:03:01,282
Riley.

862
01:03:10,525 --> 01:03:11,892
Mum! Mum!

863
01:03:12,026 --> 01:03:14,194
No, Riley, stop! Riley, stop!

864
01:03:16,598 --> 01:03:18,465
Stop! Stop!

865
01:03:22,236 --> 01:03:23,871
Stop!

866
01:03:24,004 --> 01:03:25,372
Stop!

867
01:03:33,013 --> 01:03:34,348
Riley!

868
01:03:34,783 --> 01:03:35,916
Oh, shit!

869
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:39,820
Stop! Nurse!

870
01:03:41,723 --> 01:03:43,658
Please stop him!
Please stop him!

871
01:03:48,028 --> 01:03:50,097
Riley, fucking stop now!

872
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:52,433
Fucking stop him!
Do something!

873
01:03:57,971 --> 01:03:59,206
It was you
who took it.

874
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:00,775
You could've fucking said
something, Mia.

875
01:04:00,908 --> 01:04:02,711
Who showed
the police the video?

876
01:04:02,843 --> 01:04:04,211
Think it was James.

877
01:04:04,345 --> 01:04:05,580
At least it proves
we didn't touch him.

878
01:04:05,714 --> 01:04:07,147
Police said there's not
a lot they can do

879
01:04:07,281 --> 01:04:08,449
about a kid hitting himself.

880
01:04:08,583 --> 01:04:09,651
Has it ever
lasted this long?

881
01:04:10,017 --> 01:04:11,452
No.

882
01:04:11,586 --> 01:04:13,655
But we've never been over
90 seconds before Mia, so...

883
01:04:13,788 --> 01:04:15,155
How is he?

884
01:04:16,791 --> 01:04:19,527
Every time he comes to,
he tries to kill himself.

885
01:04:20,494 --> 01:04:22,996
- They wanna keep him.
- What?

886
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:24,733
The guy who gave Duckett
the hand said

887
01:04:24,865 --> 01:04:27,101
that if you die while they're
in you, they have you forever.

888
01:04:27,234 --> 01:04:31,939
Have any of you guys...
still been seeing stuff?

889
01:04:33,173 --> 01:04:34,908
What the fuck you mean,
"seeing stuff"?

890
01:04:35,042 --> 01:04:37,411
I saw my mum at the hospital.

891
01:04:39,113 --> 01:04:42,517
And another one
attacked Daniel at my house.

892
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:45,953
- Did you see something?
- Uh... Not exactly.

893
01:04:46,086 --> 01:04:48,188
What's that
supposed to mean, Daniel?

894
01:04:48,322 --> 01:04:51,225
I woke up and Mia was...

895
01:04:53,528 --> 01:04:54,895
I dunno...

896
01:04:55,864 --> 01:04:57,297
Sucking my feet.

897
01:04:58,065 --> 01:04:59,333
The fuck?

898
01:05:00,033 --> 01:05:01,201
Jade.

899
01:05:01,335 --> 01:05:02,503
What do you mean,
"woke up with Mia"?

900
01:05:02,637 --> 01:05:04,104
What do you mean,
"sucking your feet"?

901
01:05:04,238 --> 01:05:05,172
It wasn't me,
I swear to God.

902
01:05:05,305 --> 01:05:06,841
I couldn't go home.

903
01:05:06,974 --> 01:05:08,375
Look, none of us have
been seeing shit, all right?

904
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:10,110
And we all did it.
We were all there.

905
01:05:10,244 --> 01:05:11,345
So, why would you be seeing
your mum?

906
01:05:11,478 --> 01:05:13,247
You didn't even let her in.

907
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:15,550
Wait, didn't Duckett
say they could imitate people?

908
01:05:15,683 --> 01:05:16,684
Wait, who's Duckett?

909
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:21,155
I got the hand off him.
He, uh...

910
01:05:21,288 --> 01:05:24,124
I met him twice
at some parties and...

911
01:05:24,258 --> 01:05:25,359
Yeah, we did the hand shit,

912
01:05:25,492 --> 01:05:26,761
and I asked if
I could borrow it

913
01:05:26,895 --> 01:05:28,495
and he said I could keep it.

914
01:05:31,733 --> 01:05:33,434
He said he was seeing them
without it.

915
01:05:34,435 --> 01:05:36,236
And then
he went full skitz.

916
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:39,173
Stabbed his brother,
then killed himself.

917
01:05:39,306 --> 01:05:42,209
The brother.
Can we talk to him?

918
01:05:51,853 --> 01:05:53,521
What's up, bruz?

919
01:05:53,655 --> 01:05:54,789
What are you doing here?

920
01:05:55,456 --> 01:05:57,357
We gotta talk about Duckett.

921
01:05:59,026 --> 01:06:00,394
Yeah.

922
01:06:01,428 --> 01:06:03,430
Do you know what
the shit thing is?

923
01:06:03,565 --> 01:06:05,600
He actually thought
he had friends.

924
01:06:05,733 --> 01:06:07,535
You guys always
inviting him to shit,

925
01:06:07,669 --> 01:06:09,269
acting like you cared.

926
01:06:09,403 --> 01:06:11,739
-But you were using him.
-We weren't using him, Cole.

927
01:06:11,873 --> 01:06:14,174
A real friend would've seen
it was fucking him up.

928
01:06:14,308 --> 01:06:15,910
But you didn't.

929
01:06:16,043 --> 01:06:17,946
Look, bruz, I know it's
a shit time for you right now,

930
01:06:18,078 --> 01:06:19,146
but we need your help.

931
01:06:19,279 --> 01:06:20,648
Nah, man, I'm out.

932
01:06:21,816 --> 01:06:23,183
Cole.

933
01:06:57,986 --> 01:07:01,723
I know how much it hurts
to lose someone that close.

934
01:07:11,866 --> 01:07:14,134
The people he let in
messed up his head.

935
01:07:15,302 --> 01:07:16,771
If he'd just stopped doing
that fucking thing,

936
01:07:16,905 --> 01:07:18,372
they would've left.

937
01:07:18,506 --> 01:07:21,441
My little brother's
in hospital. He went way over.

938
01:07:21,576 --> 01:07:23,310
You let a kid do it?

939
01:07:27,281 --> 01:07:28,683
His body should kick 'em out.

940
01:07:28,816 --> 01:07:30,417
They get weaker
the longer they're in.

941
01:07:30,552 --> 01:07:32,286
- It hasn't.
- Give it time.

942
01:07:32,419 --> 01:07:33,721
They're killing him.

943
01:07:34,756 --> 01:07:35,857
Maybe it's time

944
01:07:35,990 --> 01:07:37,792
you stop fucking up
people's lives, Joss.

945
01:07:37,926 --> 01:07:39,293
What do you reckon?

946
01:07:46,099 --> 01:07:47,035
Jade!

947
01:07:47,167 --> 01:07:49,236
Jade, just wait! Jade!

948
01:07:49,369 --> 01:07:51,104
You shouldn't have
let him do it, Mia!

949
01:07:51,238 --> 01:07:52,406
We all decided it'd be okay.

950
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:54,074
We didn't
decide anything.

951
01:07:54,207 --> 01:07:55,442
We did. We all said...

952
01:07:55,577 --> 01:07:56,878
We didn't say shit, Mia.
That was just you.

953
01:07:57,011 --> 01:07:58,713
And then you let it go
for two fucking minutes.

954
01:07:58,846 --> 01:07:59,781
-Jade--
-And then

955
01:07:59,914 --> 01:08:00,982
you sleep with my boyfriend.

956
01:08:01,114 --> 01:08:02,449
What the fuck is
wrong with you?

957
01:08:02,584 --> 01:08:03,518
-Jade, it wasn't like that.
-Oh, of course,

958
01:08:03,651 --> 01:08:04,619
you're gonna take her side.

959
01:08:06,888 --> 01:08:08,255
Jesus...

960
01:08:10,223 --> 01:08:14,494
I wish that you didn't force
yourself into my family, Mia.

961
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,167
Um...

962
01:08:22,302 --> 01:08:24,237
Did we blow the candle out?

963
01:08:24,371 --> 01:08:25,740
I don't remember.

964
01:08:26,874 --> 01:08:29,209
What if we opened the door
but we didn't shut it?

965
01:08:29,343 --> 01:08:31,079
What are you saying?

966
01:08:31,211 --> 01:08:32,379
I'm saying we do it again
with Riley

967
01:08:32,513 --> 01:08:33,480
but blow out the candle
this time.

968
01:08:33,615 --> 01:08:34,782
You want him to do it again?

969
01:08:34,916 --> 01:08:36,517
The thing that put him
in hospital?

970
01:08:36,651 --> 01:08:37,986
-You wanna save him?
-Don't fucking ask me that.

971
01:08:38,118 --> 01:08:39,821
Well, we have to do
something, Jade!

972
01:08:52,567 --> 01:08:54,334
I'll give it back after, okay?

973
01:08:54,468 --> 01:08:56,370
Just burn the fuckin' thing.

974
01:08:57,337 --> 01:08:59,406
Hey, good luck.

975
01:09:21,729 --> 01:09:23,363
Mum's back in, like,
an hour.

976
01:09:23,497 --> 01:09:24,799
We'll be quick.

977
01:09:43,417 --> 01:09:44,952
Oh, my God.

978
01:10:01,435 --> 01:10:03,805
Come on, Riley.
Come on, please.

979
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:13,380
Talk to him.

980
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,287
Okay, yeah, blow it out.

981
01:10:23,024 --> 01:10:24,224
Anything?

982
01:10:24,992 --> 01:10:26,527
I don't know. Um...

983
01:10:27,427 --> 01:10:28,796
Maybe if we just try it again.

984
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:30,464
- Mia...
- Just try it again.

985
01:10:38,139 --> 01:10:39,507
Talk to him.

986
01:10:42,944 --> 01:10:44,478
It's not working.

987
01:10:45,179 --> 01:10:46,881
Okay. Um...

988
01:10:49,617 --> 01:10:51,219
What if I use the hand
to speak to him?

989
01:10:51,351 --> 01:10:53,154
- No.
- What? He's not dead, Mi.

990
01:10:53,286 --> 01:10:54,555
No, but what if his spirit is

991
01:10:54,689 --> 01:10:55,923
disconnected from his body
or something?

992
01:10:56,057 --> 01:10:57,457
I thought these spirits
were in limbo.

993
01:10:57,592 --> 01:10:59,026
Yeah, well, maybe
that's where Riley is.

994
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:00,494
Might not be him.

995
01:11:00,628 --> 01:11:01,796
-Well, what if it is?
-And what if it isn't?

996
01:11:01,929 --> 01:11:03,131
Yeah, this is
a bad idea, Mia.

997
01:11:03,263 --> 01:11:04,498
Mia.

998
01:11:05,032 --> 01:11:06,134
Mia, don't.

999
01:11:08,468 --> 01:11:11,639
Riley, talk to me.

1000
01:11:19,914 --> 01:11:20,948
Hi.

1001
01:11:21,082 --> 01:11:22,517
- Is it him?
- Shh.

1002
01:11:25,318 --> 01:11:26,921
Is there a boy here?

1003
01:11:29,090 --> 01:11:30,357
Him.

1004
01:11:32,527 --> 01:11:34,394
Do you know where he is?

1005
01:11:37,965 --> 01:11:39,567
Please.

1006
01:11:40,433 --> 01:11:42,335
I can take you to him.

1007
01:11:43,271 --> 01:11:44,539
Okay.

1008
01:11:47,875 --> 01:11:49,076
I let you in.

1009
01:11:57,051 --> 01:11:58,619
Help!

1010
01:12:04,892 --> 01:12:07,327
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. You okay?

1011
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:09,496
No! Don't touch me!

1012
01:12:09,630 --> 01:12:11,766
Don't touch me!

1013
01:12:11,899 --> 01:12:13,201
Hey, hey, hey.

1014
01:12:13,333 --> 01:12:14,434
Hey.

1015
01:12:14,569 --> 01:12:16,604
It's just us.

1016
01:12:16,737 --> 01:12:18,105
It's just me and Daniel.

1017
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:20,942
What happened?

1018
01:12:21,075 --> 01:12:22,944
I saw him.

1019
01:12:23,811 --> 01:12:25,880
They're hurting him, Jade.

1020
01:12:27,081 --> 01:12:29,250
They're not gonna stop.

1021
01:12:29,382 --> 01:12:31,586
They're never gonna stop.

1022
01:12:52,472 --> 01:12:53,841
Mia.

1023
01:12:57,812 --> 01:13:00,014
I haven't been
completely honest with you.

1024
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:03,784
But I want to be.

1025
01:13:22,069 --> 01:13:23,738
Your mother...

1026
01:13:23,871 --> 01:13:27,508
Before she passed,
she left us something.

1027
01:13:27,642 --> 01:13:28,976
Something I've been
scared to show you.

1028
01:13:29,110 --> 01:13:31,279
Which is...
Which is wrong of me.

1029
01:13:31,411 --> 01:13:34,882
Because it's... It's just as
much as yours as it is mine.

1030
01:13:37,685 --> 01:13:39,419
Can I read it to you?

1031
01:13:57,672 --> 01:13:59,472
"Dear Max and Mia.

1032
01:14:01,575 --> 01:14:03,476
"It is Tuesday today

1033
01:14:04,378 --> 01:14:05,746
"and it's raining.

1034
01:14:06,580 --> 01:14:10,151
"It's the first time
in a long time,

1035
01:14:10,284 --> 01:14:12,153
"I haven't felt hopeless."

1036
01:14:15,723 --> 01:14:17,091
"In fact...

1037
01:14:18,693 --> 01:14:20,761
"I am full of hope.

1038
01:14:24,464 --> 01:14:27,969
"I hope you live
beyond your years

1039
01:14:28,803 --> 01:14:31,539
"and find absolute happiness.

1040
01:14:36,644 --> 01:14:39,213
"I hope you... I hope you
don't hate me for this."

1041
01:14:40,881 --> 01:14:43,483
"I hope you find it
in your heart to forgive me.

1042
01:14:44,919 --> 01:14:48,656
"I hope you can find
some peace in knowing

1043
01:14:49,290 --> 01:14:51,158
"I am no longer in pain."

1044
01:14:55,162 --> 01:14:56,964
I'm sorry, Mi.

1045
01:14:59,867 --> 01:15:01,869
-It's hers, Mia.
-No.

1046
01:15:02,003 --> 01:15:04,071
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm.
- It's okay.

1047
01:15:04,972 --> 01:15:06,607
No, she didn't do it.

1048
01:15:06,741 --> 01:15:08,843
She didn't do it,
because she told me, Dad.

1049
01:15:08,976 --> 01:15:11,245
She didn't do it,
because she told me.

1050
01:15:12,713 --> 01:15:15,182
She told me.
She told me.

1051
01:15:15,316 --> 01:15:16,650
Mia.

1052
01:15:16,784 --> 01:15:18,686
Mia. Come here.

1053
01:15:18,819 --> 01:15:19,987
Sweetheart.

1054
01:15:20,121 --> 01:15:22,690
She's gone.

1055
01:15:25,426 --> 01:15:27,294
I'm sorry I kept it from you.

1056
01:15:30,598 --> 01:15:32,900
I didn't want you
blaming yourself.

1057
01:15:39,907 --> 01:15:41,642
<i>It's not true.</i>

1058
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:54,288
I'll be back.

1059
01:15:55,089 --> 01:15:56,257
What?

1060
01:15:57,925 --> 01:15:59,593
-I'll be back, I promise.
-Mi...

1061
01:15:59,727 --> 01:16:01,429
I promise. I just...
I just gotta go.

1062
01:16:01,562 --> 01:16:03,497
I'll be back, Dad.
I'll be back.

1063
01:16:07,134 --> 01:16:08,235
<i>Mi.</i>

1064
01:16:08,369 --> 01:16:10,271
<i>He's lying.</i>

1065
01:16:10,404 --> 01:16:13,140
- Then why did you write it?
- I didn't.

1066
01:16:13,542 --> 01:16:15,242
Sweetheart.

1067
01:16:15,376 --> 01:16:17,178
That's not your dad.

1068
01:16:18,612 --> 01:16:19,980
What?

1069
01:16:24,351 --> 01:16:25,619
Mia?

1070
01:16:26,987 --> 01:16:28,722
That's not Max.

1071
01:16:29,290 --> 01:16:30,391
Mia?

1072
01:16:30,525 --> 01:16:32,159
They're imitating him.

1073
01:16:35,996 --> 01:16:38,232
He's going to hurt you.

1074
01:16:38,365 --> 01:16:40,367
Mia, open the door!

1075
01:16:48,309 --> 01:16:51,712
Riley can't stay there.

1076
01:16:51,846 --> 01:16:53,614
- Mia?
- He's suffering, Mi.

1077
01:16:53,747 --> 01:16:55,616
What... What do I do?

1078
01:16:57,785 --> 01:16:59,120
He needs to die.

1079
01:16:59,253 --> 01:17:00,721
- What?
- Mia?

1080
01:17:00,855 --> 01:17:03,023
You have to put him
out of his misery.

1081
01:17:03,157 --> 01:17:05,092
No, Mum, I, I, I can't. I can't.

1082
01:17:05,226 --> 01:17:07,128
They're never gonna
let him go.

1083
01:17:07,261 --> 01:17:09,763
No, Mum, please, no...

1084
01:17:09,897 --> 01:17:11,699
I'll look after him, Mi.

1085
01:17:11,832 --> 01:17:13,634
Open the damn door!

1086
01:17:13,767 --> 01:17:15,769
Help him, Mia.

1087
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:17,805
Let me in!

1088
01:17:17,938 --> 01:17:19,508
Help him, Mia!

1089
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:21,842
No, just leave me alone!

1090
01:17:51,972 --> 01:17:54,675
Mia!

1091
01:17:55,442 --> 01:17:57,478
-Mia!
-Help me!

1092
01:17:59,246 --> 01:18:00,582
I'm trying!

1093
01:18:10,691 --> 01:18:12,059
Mia!

1094
01:18:25,806 --> 01:18:27,875
Oh, my God.

1095
01:19:13,722 --> 01:19:14,955
<i>Hey.</i>

1096
01:19:15,256 --> 01:19:16,257
Jade?

1097
01:19:17,424 --> 01:19:18,792
<i>You okay?</i>

1098
01:19:21,862 --> 01:19:23,397
I know what to do.

1099
01:19:25,366 --> 01:19:26,867
We can save him.

1100
01:19:28,502 --> 01:19:30,437
You know, I actually think
he's getting better.

1101
01:19:31,438 --> 01:19:32,873
He woke up for a second.

1102
01:19:33,007 --> 01:19:34,208
It's like he was
himself again.

1103
01:19:35,510 --> 01:19:37,211
I've seen him, Jade.

1104
01:19:38,513 --> 01:19:40,214
He's in pain.

1105
01:19:41,915 --> 01:19:44,385
And every second
is agony for him.

1106
01:19:46,987 --> 01:19:48,523
Just come to mine.

1107
01:19:50,991 --> 01:19:52,359
<i>And I'll show you.</i>

1108
01:19:52,493 --> 01:19:53,662
Show me what?

1109
01:19:54,596 --> 01:19:56,897
<i>You just have to</i>
<i>be here, Jade.</i>

1110
01:19:57,699 --> 01:19:59,066
<i>Please.</i>

1111
01:20:00,267 --> 01:20:03,003
<i>- Just trust me.</i>
- Oh, shit.

1112
01:20:03,871 --> 01:20:06,407
Okay. I'll be there in ten.

1113
01:20:55,690 --> 01:20:57,224
Mia.

1114
01:20:59,594 --> 01:21:00,861
I'm... sorry.

1115
01:21:00,994 --> 01:21:02,896
No, it's okay. Sit.

1116
01:21:11,171 --> 01:21:13,374
I was wondering
when I'd see you again.

1117
01:21:14,007 --> 01:21:15,510
You haven't come.

1118
01:21:17,244 --> 01:21:18,780
You told me not to.

1119
01:21:18,912 --> 01:21:21,616
Yeah. I know. I was mad.

1120
01:21:23,785 --> 01:21:25,486
You had every right to be.

1121
01:21:26,387 --> 01:21:27,921
Still do.

1122
01:21:29,591 --> 01:21:31,125
No, I don't.

1123
01:21:32,761 --> 01:21:34,428
There were no drugs, Mia.

1124
01:21:36,330 --> 01:21:38,767
He had a breakdown.
I just... I just...

1125
01:21:38,899 --> 01:21:40,434
couldn't face that.

1126
01:21:41,536 --> 01:21:43,270
I'm so sorry
that I blamed you.

1127
01:21:43,404 --> 01:21:46,306
I know that you wouldn't
do anything to hurt him.

1128
01:21:47,141 --> 01:21:49,577
I love you guys.

1129
01:21:49,711 --> 01:21:52,913
You're not Riley's friend,
Mia, you're his family.

1130
01:21:54,649 --> 01:21:57,384
It'd mean so much to him
that you were here.

1131
01:22:12,567 --> 01:22:14,968
Can I have a minute
with him?

1132
01:22:15,969 --> 01:22:17,572
Alone.

1133
01:22:17,705 --> 01:22:19,106
Of course.

1134
01:22:43,297 --> 01:22:45,032
I'm so sorry.

1135
01:23:21,201 --> 01:23:23,738
Found me.

1136
01:23:31,779 --> 01:23:33,046
Mia!

1137
01:23:33,948 --> 01:23:35,984
I am ending this!

1138
01:23:36,116 --> 01:23:40,254
You... can't take him.

1139
01:23:40,955 --> 01:23:42,557
He's ours.

1140
01:23:51,766 --> 01:23:53,267
Where is he?

1141
01:23:53,668 --> 01:23:55,135
You saw.

1142
01:24:12,687 --> 01:24:15,422
Why don't you...

1143
01:24:16,123 --> 01:24:17,659
touch me?

1144
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:23,798
I want to feel you.

1145
01:24:40,949 --> 01:24:42,215
Max?

1146
01:24:46,119 --> 01:24:47,421
Jade. Where are you?

1147
01:24:47,555 --> 01:24:48,890
<i>At Mia's. She's not here.</i>

1148
01:24:49,023 --> 01:24:51,960
<i>-Max needs an ambulance.</i>
-What... No, Mia's here.

1149
01:24:52,092 --> 01:24:53,695
What's wrong? What's happened?

1150
01:24:53,828 --> 01:24:56,064
<i>- She's there?</i>
- Yeah, she's with Riley.

1151
01:24:56,196 --> 01:24:57,799
<i>Mum, she's dangerous!</i>

1152
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:01,536
Mia?

1153
01:25:01,836 --> 01:25:02,837
Riley!

1154
01:25:09,711 --> 01:25:12,013
Hey! Where's my son?
He was in this room.

1155
01:25:12,145 --> 01:25:13,480
Well, he should be here.
He was just here.

1156
01:25:13,615 --> 01:25:15,115
Well, where the fuck is he?

1157
01:25:32,132 --> 01:25:33,333
Mia!

1158
01:25:34,669 --> 01:25:37,304

01:26:03,296 --> 01:26:04,498

1164
01:26:18,178 --> 01:26:20,882
I'm so proud of you.

1165
01:26:27,421 --> 01:26:30,490
Take him, my darling girl.

1166
01:26:31,592 --> 01:26:33,226
You're doing the right thing.

1167
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:34,662
Mm-hmm.

1168
01:26:34,796 --> 01:26:37,497
Show him the way.

1169
01:26:38,298 --> 01:26:40,367
I can protect him.

1170
01:26:41,703 --> 01:26:44,204
We'll have him forever.

1171
