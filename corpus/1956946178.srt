XENA: WARRIOR PRINCESS

13
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:12,600
Looking out at the cosmos
makes you think...

14
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:14,500
about where we are...,

15
00:01:14,601 --> 00:01:16,400
where we've been...,

16
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:18,800
where we're going now.

17
00:01:20,401 --> 00:01:21,900
Yeah.

18
00:01:22,001 --> 00:01:24,100
And like the bigger now.

19
00:01:24,101 --> 00:01:26,000
I mean, Gabrielle,
what are we gonna do?

20
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:29,800
Wander around Greece our whole lives
looking for trouble?

21
00:01:29,801 --> 00:01:31,200
Why don't we go away?

22
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:33,100
Far away? Whaddya say?

23
00:01:33,101 --> 00:01:35,800
I can't believe you're awake,
much less listening to me.

24
00:01:35,901 --> 00:01:38,500
Let's go south,
to the land of the pharaohs.

25
00:01:38,601 --> 00:01:41,900
I hear they're in need
of a girl with a chakram.

26
00:01:43,701 --> 00:01:45,500
You know
that there's somebody out there.

27
00:01:45,601 --> 00:01:49,100
Yeah, he's been trying to find us
the past half-hour.

28
00:02:02,301 --> 00:02:03,300
Are you all right?

29
00:02:03,401 --> 00:02:05,400
Oh. Yes. Thank you.

30
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:06,700
Whoa!

31
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:08,900
Are you Xena?

32
00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:10,600
Who's askin'?

33
00:02:10,701 --> 00:02:13,300
A messenger, sent by Akemi.

34
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:17,900
Akemi?

35
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:21,400
You saw Akemi?

36
00:02:21,801 --> 00:02:23,500
Several weeks ago...,

37
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:25,900
I was journeying with another monk
through a forest,

38
00:02:25,901 --> 00:02:27,400
near the town of Higuchi.

39
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:29,300
It started to rain...,

40
00:02:29,301 --> 00:02:31,700
and we sought shelter
at a teahouse.

41
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,000
Kenji...,

42
00:03:25,501 --> 00:03:28,800
not even you
could be frightened of this.

43
00:04:08,001 --> 00:04:12,100
Your shuji has
great dignity and beauty.

44
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:29,000
I am blessed with a certainty...

45
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:31,700
about what it means to be a monk.

46
00:04:34,501 --> 00:04:35,900
But my companion...

47
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:39,400
was not as steadfast in his resolve.

48
00:05:09,501 --> 00:05:12,100
You must leave... now.

49
00:05:13,401 --> 00:05:15,300
Come on!

50
00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:17,500
What?!

51
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:42,300
I know you're a good man.

52
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:45,200
In the teahose, I felt
the compassion in your heart.

53
00:06:45,201 --> 00:06:46,900
Don't fear me.

54
00:06:46,901 --> 00:06:48,800
Who-Who...
Who was that demon?!

55
00:06:48,801 --> 00:06:50,900
The Lord of the Dark Land.

56
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:53,300
He's preparing an army
to wage war in Higuchi...

57
00:06:53,301 --> 00:06:55,400
and slowly, the populace.

58
00:06:55,801 --> 00:06:57,800
Honorable monk...,

59
00:06:59,801 --> 00:07:01,700
I beg you to do
what must be done:

60
00:07:01,801 --> 00:07:04,500
to stop him enslaving the souls
of that city.

61
00:07:04,501 --> 00:07:06,400
But I'm no swordsman!

62
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,500
There's one in the west...

63
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:11,100
far beyond the setting sun.

64
00:07:11,201 --> 00:07:15,000
A samurai?! A priest?! A god?!

65
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:17,000
No.

66
00:07:17,301 --> 00:07:19,600
A warrior princess.

67
00:07:27,401 --> 00:07:29,100
Xena, you must save Higuchi

68
00:07:29,201 --> 00:07:31,100
from destruction.

69
00:07:31,801 --> 00:07:33,800
The Land of the Rising Sun.

70
00:07:33,901 --> 00:07:36,000
That's beyond Chin[a].

71
00:07:36,301 --> 00:07:38,800
I didn't know
you were there, Xena.

72
00:07:39,101 --> 00:07:41,400
Yes, I was there.

73
00:07:42,901 --> 00:07:44,700
I was there.

74
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:51,100
Gabrielle, this is not going to be
the trip that I promised you...,

75
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:54,500
but if Akemi calls,
I must go.

76
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:57,600
Wherever you go,
I'm by your side.

77
00:07:58,501 --> 00:08:00,900
I knew you'd say that.

78
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:23,900
The way of the sword...

79
00:08:23,901 --> 00:08:27,000
is the most ancient
of the warrior's art.

80
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:28,600
With practice,

81
00:08:28,601 --> 00:08:31,700
the samurai develops
the sacred virtues of bravery...,

82
00:08:31,701 --> 00:08:34,000
self-discipline, and honor.

83
00:08:34,001 --> 00:08:36,000
A samurai would rather die
a warrior

84
00:08:36,001 --> 00:08:37,300
than live as a coward.

85
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:39,600
This Akemi who sent for Xena...,

86
00:08:39,701 --> 00:08:41,900
what do you know about her?

87
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:47,100
She was forced by Yodoshi...,

88
00:08:47,201 --> 00:08:49,500
the Lord of the Dark Land...,

89
00:08:49,601 --> 00:08:51,500
to seduce souls...

90
00:08:51,601 --> 00:08:53,600
into his grasp.

91
00:08:56,601 --> 00:08:58,900
She's very beautiful.

92
00:09:00,801 --> 00:09:02,800
- And she's a ghost.
- She's a...?

93
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:12,000
Gabrielle, before we reach
Japa...,

94
00:09:12,601 --> 00:09:16,300
I should tell you everything
that happened there last time.

95
00:09:29,901 --> 00:09:32,600
Many years ago...,
Borias told me

96
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:36,800
about a young girl who was kidnapped
by a Chinese warlord.

97
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:40,200
She'd been taken hostage
from a mighty island...

98
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:43,100
even further east than Chin[a].

99
00:09:44,101 --> 00:09:47,000
Being the kind of person
I was then...,

100
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:49,400
the challenge of finding
a new land to plunder

101
00:09:49,401 --> 00:09:51,800
was just too much for me.

102
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:54,400
I had to meet her.

103
00:09:58,701 --> 00:10:00,400
So, her daddy's rich, you say?

104
00:10:00,401 --> 00:10:02,700
And powerful.
He should pay well

105
00:10:02,701 --> 00:10:05,300
for the return of his sweet daughter.

106
00:10:05,901 --> 00:10:07,300
Come.

107
00:10:14,601 --> 00:10:19,400
- Akemi, meet...
- ...Xena, the Warrior Princess.

108
00:10:23,101 --> 00:10:25,200
You know me?

109
00:10:26,401 --> 00:10:27,600
Oh, yes.

110
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:30,400
I've heard that
you're afraid of nothing.

111
00:10:31,101 --> 00:10:32,700
Kao, here...,

112
00:10:33,001 --> 00:10:36,300
- he's afraid of many things.
- This girl has spirit.

113
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:38,100
This girl deserves to die...,

114
00:10:38,101 --> 00:10:40,800
speaking like that
in front of my guests.

115
00:10:41,101 --> 00:10:43,300
You won't kill me.

116
00:10:43,401 --> 00:10:45,100
Xena won't let you.

117
00:10:45,401 --> 00:10:47,300
Because in her heart...

118
00:10:47,301 --> 00:10:49,400
she knows
that she will soon love me.

119
00:10:49,401 --> 00:10:52,200
Xena loves no one.

120
00:10:53,101 --> 00:10:54,900
I'll be your student, Xena.

121
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:58,400
You'll take me with you.
You'll teach me everything you know.

122
00:10:58,401 --> 00:11:00,200
I have a few lessons for you!

123
00:11:03,401 --> 00:11:04,800
Here.

124
00:11:05,201 --> 00:11:06,600
Fifty pieces of gold.

125
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:09,000
It's the best offer
you'll get for her.

126
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:10,900
I do what I want
with my property.

127
00:11:11,001 --> 00:11:12,900
I say this isn't a good day
to trade.

128
00:11:12,901 --> 00:11:15,100
Is it a good day to die?

129
00:11:15,501 --> 00:11:18,300
It's unhealthy to negotiate
with this one.

130
00:11:18,301 --> 00:11:20,200
I'd take the gold.

131
00:11:23,301 --> 00:11:24,500
Guards!

132
00:12:19,701 --> 00:12:22,600
I've shut off the flow of blood
to your brain.

133
00:12:22,601 --> 00:12:26,700
You got ten, nine, eight...

134
00:12:26,801 --> 00:12:28,700
Ah, forget it.

135
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:52,000
I would have taken the gold.

136
00:13:34,501 --> 00:13:37,100
You know, Borias,
I have a dream...,

137
00:13:37,201 --> 00:13:41,000
a dream of conquering every land
between here and Brittania.

138
00:13:41,001 --> 00:13:42,900
Xena, you're always looking

139
00:13:42,901 --> 00:13:45,500
for green pastures
to rape and pillage.

140
00:13:45,501 --> 00:13:46,800
Yep.

141
00:13:46,801 --> 00:13:49,900
And maybe there's more in this
than just the ransom, huh?

142
00:13:50,001 --> 00:13:51,700
I mean, with her father
as an ally,

143
00:13:51,801 --> 00:13:54,200
I could get a nice toehold
on that island.

144
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:57,500
What makes you so sure
she'll lead you to daddy?

145
00:13:57,801 --> 00:14:00,500
Ah, she wouldn't lie to me.
Hmm.

146
00:14:00,501 --> 00:14:02,700
She worships her teacher.

147
00:14:07,501 --> 00:14:08,600
What's so funny?

148
00:14:08,601 --> 00:14:11,800
Xena, you couldn't teach
a dog to bark.

149
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:18,100
Akemi!

150
00:14:18,101 --> 00:14:20,500
Come here,
I wanna show you something.

151
00:14:22,101 --> 00:14:23,500
You're wrong.

152
00:14:23,601 --> 00:14:26,200
Xena will be a great teacher.

153
00:14:30,101 --> 00:14:31,200
I'm ready.

154
00:14:31,301 --> 00:14:32,700
All right.

155
00:14:32,701 --> 00:14:36,600
If someone's comin' atcha
with a right/left combination...,

156
00:14:36,601 --> 00:14:38,200
this is what I wantcha to do.

157
00:14:38,201 --> 00:14:40,800
You feint back,
twist in the direction of the blow,

158
00:14:40,901 --> 00:14:44,100
and then deliver a vicious jumping,
spinning back-kick.

159
00:14:44,101 --> 00:14:45,500
All right?

160
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:48,100
Right. So...,
that's right, a left,

161
00:14:48,201 --> 00:14:50,400
a feint, uh,
a jumping, swinging...

162
00:14:50,401 --> 00:14:52,900
Jumping, spinning back-kick.

163
00:14:53,801 --> 00:14:55,000
All right.

164
00:14:55,101 --> 00:14:56,800
Now, I'll be a bad guy.

165
00:14:56,901 --> 00:14:58,200
Hmm.

166
00:15:10,301 --> 00:15:12,400
Lesson One:

167
00:15:13,201 --> 00:15:16,300
trust no one.

168
00:15:21,401 --> 00:15:26,300
Remember, Xena,
I get 10% of the ransom.

169
00:15:27,701 --> 00:15:30,600
Good luck, teacher.

170
00:15:57,401 --> 00:16:00,700
Come on, Akemi, keep up.

171
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:03,500
My ribs are still a little sore.

172
00:16:03,501 --> 00:16:06,900
Well, next time we'll start
with something a little simpler.

173
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:10,800
Like listening.

174
00:16:10,901 --> 00:16:12,500
Listen to that.

175
00:16:12,601 --> 00:16:14,500
To what?

176
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:17,600
To life and death.

177
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:21,100
Every sound, every movement
is a message.

178
00:16:22,401 --> 00:16:26,100
A wagon just crossed
a creek up ahead.

179
00:16:29,601 --> 00:16:32,400
A deer grazing nearby.

180
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:37,000
When you listen to the Kami
like that...,

181
00:16:37,001 --> 00:16:39,000
you must be at peace.

182
00:16:39,701 --> 00:16:41,400
The Kami? What's that?

183
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:43,900
The Kami are the powers
behind all nature.

184
00:16:44,001 --> 00:16:47,500
They make the sun shine,
the grass grow.

185
00:16:47,501 --> 00:16:49,000
They brought you to me.

186
00:16:49,001 --> 00:16:51,900
No, no, no. When I listen
like that, I'm at war.

187
00:16:52,001 --> 00:16:55,700
Every sound is a possible warning
of an enemy approaching.

188
00:16:55,701 --> 00:16:57,900
I believe that one day, Xena...,

189
00:16:57,901 --> 00:17:01,000
the Kami will help you
know peace.

190
00:17:02,501 --> 00:17:04,600
And I would be honored...

191
00:17:05,001 --> 00:17:07,100
if you would accept this.

192
00:17:09,901 --> 00:17:11,600
Oh.

193
00:17:11,701 --> 00:17:13,400
Uh...

194
00:17:17,701 --> 00:17:19,800
It's really pretty.

195
00:17:21,801 --> 00:17:23,500
It's our scripts.

196
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,500
When my people are overcome
with a feeling

197
00:17:25,501 --> 00:17:27,700
that needs to be preserved...,

198
00:17:28,101 --> 00:17:30,100
we write verse.

199
00:17:30,201 --> 00:17:31,900
Oh, yeah?

200
00:17:31,901 --> 00:17:35,300
- Like what feeling?
- Love.

201
00:17:37,801 --> 00:17:39,300
Love?

202
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:40,800
"Yesterday...,

203
00:17:40,801 --> 00:17:43,700
the moon took lodging
on my sleeve.

204
00:17:43,701 --> 00:17:45,700
Today...,

205
00:17:45,701 --> 00:17:49,200
I've hope for even
the brokenhearted stars."

206
00:17:52,001 --> 00:17:53,700
So beautiful.

207
00:17:53,701 --> 00:17:57,500
To write something like that,
she must have loved you very much.

208
00:17:59,901 --> 00:18:01,500
What's wrong?

209
00:18:01,801 --> 00:18:04,500
The truth is, Gabrielle...,

210
00:18:05,601 --> 00:18:08,200
she broke my heart.

211
00:18:09,601 --> 00:18:12,000
She broke your heart?

212
00:18:12,901 --> 00:18:14,800
I don't understand.

213
00:18:15,101 --> 00:18:18,200
For a while,
I didn't understand myself.

214
00:18:19,601 --> 00:18:23,200
When I travelled with Akemi
to her island for the ransom...,

215
00:18:23,301 --> 00:18:27,200
I was to learn that my heart
was seeking something else.

216
00:18:37,801 --> 00:18:40,400
I thought I was taking you
to your father.

217
00:18:40,401 --> 00:18:42,200
His castle's in the north.

218
00:18:42,201 --> 00:18:44,600
We came here first
to visit my grandfather.

219
00:18:44,701 --> 00:18:48,700
He... died here...
many years ago.

220
00:18:49,001 --> 00:18:50,800
Are you telling me
that we've walked days

221
00:18:50,901 --> 00:18:53,200
in the wrong direction
to see a dead guy?!

222
00:18:53,301 --> 00:18:56,600
We must visit my grandfather
to seek his blessing.

223
00:18:56,901 --> 00:19:01,500
He's dead..., but...
I can still speak to him.

224
00:19:16,901 --> 00:19:20,800
All your talk
about moons up your sleeve...,

225
00:19:20,901 --> 00:19:23,800
you were playing me
for a fool.

226
00:19:23,801 --> 00:19:24,900
I oughtta just...!

227
00:19:33,301 --> 00:19:36,400
You hear the Kami
through the sounds of nature.

228
00:19:36,401 --> 00:19:37,800
In the same way,

229
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:41,200
I hear sounds
that are silent to you.

230
00:20:04,601 --> 00:20:05,800
My grandfather says

231
00:20:05,801 --> 00:20:08,100
that you are a wise and appropriate
teacher.

232
00:20:08,101 --> 00:20:09,300
And...

233
00:20:09,301 --> 00:20:13,300
he feels your sword...
is not good enough.

234
00:20:13,701 --> 00:20:15,800
There's a string of widows
from here to Greece

235
00:20:15,801 --> 00:20:17,600
that say different.

236
00:20:18,401 --> 00:20:20,900
Compared to a katana...

237
00:20:20,901 --> 00:20:23,900
all other swords
are toys.

238
00:20:25,001 --> 00:20:26,500
Well...,

239
00:20:27,301 --> 00:20:29,800
then get me one of those.

240
00:20:30,901 --> 00:20:33,800
The Great Katana
lies near here.

241
00:20:34,301 --> 00:20:36,900
But... you must know.

242
00:20:37,001 --> 00:20:39,100
In our country...

243
00:20:39,401 --> 00:20:42,300
women are forbidden
to own katana.

244
00:20:43,601 --> 00:20:47,100
Well, they're just gonna have
to get used to it, aren't they?

245
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:09,300
Sensei!

246
00:21:11,101 --> 00:21:13,100
I come bearing a challenge.

247
00:21:13,101 --> 00:21:16,300
My master wishes to fight you
for possession of the Katana...,

248
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:19,600
forged from the purest ore
of the Hakiman temple.

249
00:21:19,701 --> 00:21:23,100
Your master must be
a mighty samurai.

250
00:21:27,801 --> 00:21:29,900
Oh, no.

251
00:21:30,301 --> 00:21:35,900
I'm just a girl... in search
of a really good sword.

252
00:21:36,901 --> 00:21:40,000
A woman?
A foreigner?!

253
00:21:40,101 --> 00:21:42,600
Challenging us?
For the sacred katana?!

254
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:45,400
This is a great insolence!

255
00:21:45,701 --> 00:21:49,400
Well, I guess you're gonna have
to teach me a lesson, hmm?

256
00:21:59,001 --> 00:22:01,700
Ooh, gimme, gimme!

257
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,900
Yeah.

258
00:23:48,001 --> 00:23:49,800
Grandpa was right.

259
00:23:49,901 --> 00:23:53,200
Now, this is a sword.

260
00:24:00,001 --> 00:24:01,800
"In a flurry of snow,

261
00:24:01,801 --> 00:24:05,200
two breaths of wind unite...
and become as one...,

262
00:24:05,301 --> 00:24:08,300
and then disappear
into each other."

263
00:24:14,601 --> 00:24:16,300
Listen, Akemi...,

264
00:24:16,301 --> 00:24:19,300
I don't want you to take this
the wrong way.

265
00:24:20,301 --> 00:24:22,400
I really love this sword...,

266
00:24:22,401 --> 00:24:25,700
and you're a nice kid, but
I just came for the ransom.

267
00:24:25,701 --> 00:24:27,900
I don't believe that.

268
00:24:33,201 --> 00:24:35,400
What do you hear now?

269
00:24:36,301 --> 00:24:39,000
Snow falling on cedars.

270
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:42,800
No.

271
00:24:44,501 --> 00:24:49,000
Your heart...
beating harder than normal.

272
00:24:57,501 --> 00:24:59,900
You're a master of war...,

273
00:24:59,901 --> 00:25:03,700
yet... you know no words
to speak of love.

274
00:25:04,001 --> 00:25:06,800
And then you go
and save my life.

275
00:25:06,901 --> 00:25:10,100
There's no greater gift of love
a teacher can give a student

276
00:25:10,101 --> 00:25:12,200
than that.

277
00:25:16,701 --> 00:25:19,500
I have another gift
I must ask of you.

278
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,900
I saw what you did
to kill that coward, Kao.

279
00:25:23,901 --> 00:25:25,800
It's a sacred trust.

280
00:25:25,801 --> 00:25:29,900
I would be honored,
beyond words...,

281
00:25:30,601 --> 00:25:33,300
if you'd teach me that.

282
00:25:38,801 --> 00:25:41,000
All right.

283
00:25:41,001 --> 00:25:44,000
You knew her for a few weeks
and you taught her the pinch?

284
00:25:44,101 --> 00:25:45,900
- Xena, in all the time...
- Higuchi is under siege,

285
00:25:46,001 --> 00:25:48,600
and there's no place to dock.
I'm turning back.

286
00:25:48,601 --> 00:25:50,300
What?!

287
00:25:53,401 --> 00:25:55,600
Gabrielle, I've got to go ashore.

288
00:25:55,701 --> 00:25:57,500
I'm with you.

289
00:25:57,801 --> 00:25:59,700
I knew you'd say that.

290
00:26:37,101 --> 00:26:38,800
The katana!

291
00:26:38,801 --> 00:26:42,300
You sent it
to the foreign whore!

292
00:26:48,101 --> 00:26:50,200
Thank you.

293
00:26:52,201 --> 00:26:55,500
She's traveling
to the city of Higuchi...,

294
00:26:55,601 --> 00:26:58,100
which my army
right now...

295
00:26:58,101 --> 00:27:00,300
is destroying.

296
00:27:00,701 --> 00:27:03,100
My general awaits her...,

297
00:27:03,101 --> 00:27:08,900
and when he captures Xena
and my katana...,

298
00:27:12,801 --> 00:27:15,400
she'll lose her head...

299
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:18,400
to the sting of its blade.

300
00:27:18,501 --> 00:27:21,100
So, thank you...,

301
00:27:22,101 --> 00:27:23,900
daughter.

302
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:24,300
Firebombs!

303
00:28:24,301 --> 00:28:27,400
They're going to burn Higuchi
to the ground.

304
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:33,600
We've gotta release the water
from the tower.

305
00:28:38,001 --> 00:28:40,400
Gabrielle, what would you do?

306
00:28:41,301 --> 00:28:42,900
I saw these acrobats.

307
00:28:42,901 --> 00:28:45,700
- They used to...
- Show me, Gabrielle.

308
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:58,400
Climb on!

309
00:29:19,701 --> 00:29:21,700
All right. What's next?

310
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,200
This way!

311
00:29:36,201 --> 00:29:38,500
Gabrielle!

312
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,900
Whoa!

313
00:29:55,401 --> 00:29:57,000
Xena!

314
00:30:33,501 --> 00:30:35,700
Go for the ladder!

315
00:31:03,701 --> 00:31:05,300
Kill her!

316
00:32:03,701 --> 00:32:06,000
Retreat!

317
00:32:28,501 --> 00:32:29,700
A wise general

318
00:32:29,701 --> 00:32:32,100
knows when a fight
is lost...,

319
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:34,400
but I think
we will meet again...

320
00:32:34,401 --> 00:32:36,300
soon.

321
00:32:44,301 --> 00:32:46,000
Whoohoo!

322
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:52,400
We've won! We've won!

323
00:32:52,501 --> 00:32:54,700
Move! Move!

324
00:32:58,201 --> 00:33:01,000
We've won! We've won!

325
00:33:01,101 --> 00:33:03,300
Move! Move!

326
00:33:04,101 --> 00:33:06,900
This way! Follow me!

327
00:33:10,301 --> 00:33:12,600
Higuchi is saved.

328
00:33:12,601 --> 00:33:17,500
Not quite the way I would have done it,
Gabrielle, but it sure worked.

329
00:33:26,501 --> 00:33:28,700
You know, Xena,
I still don't understand.

330
00:33:28,801 --> 00:33:30,900
You taught Akemi
the pinch.

331
00:33:30,901 --> 00:33:33,100
Did she ever use it?

332
00:33:34,001 --> 00:33:37,200
Yes, unfortunately she did.

333
00:33:38,201 --> 00:33:42,200
After a many days' walk,
we reached her father's fortress.

334
00:34:34,401 --> 00:34:36,200
Akemi?

335
00:34:44,201 --> 00:34:45,800
Akemi, what are you doing?

336
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:05,900
You've thirty seconds to live.

337
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:14,000
My brothers...,

338
00:35:14,101 --> 00:35:16,100
my sisters...,

339
00:35:16,201 --> 00:35:17,600
my mother...,

340
00:35:17,701 --> 00:35:20,600
and my gentle grandparents.

341
00:35:20,601 --> 00:35:25,500
I avenge all your deaths...
at the hands of this monster.

342
00:35:35,901 --> 00:35:38,200
- Father.
- Father?

343
00:35:38,301 --> 00:35:40,500
I pray you suffer
in death...

344
00:35:40,601 --> 00:35:43,700
the way your family
suffered in life.

345
00:35:54,101 --> 00:35:56,100
What the hell
did you do that for?

346
00:35:56,101 --> 00:35:58,400
It was my duty.

347
00:35:59,201 --> 00:36:01,600
He had to die.

348
00:36:04,401 --> 00:36:07,600
I don't care about that!
What about the ransom?!

349
00:36:15,701 --> 00:36:18,300
Where's my money?!

350
00:36:23,201 --> 00:36:25,400
Forgive me, Xena.

351
00:36:25,701 --> 00:36:28,900
I don't suppose
there's any inheritance in this!

352
00:36:29,201 --> 00:36:32,000
I have one last thing
to ask of you.

353
00:36:34,701 --> 00:36:37,100
Restore my honor.

354
00:36:37,201 --> 00:36:39,500
The sacred katana.

355
00:36:46,601 --> 00:36:48,700
You want me to cut off...?

356
00:36:49,701 --> 00:36:52,800
That's why you wanted me
to take the katana.

357
00:36:54,001 --> 00:36:57,700
After that is done...,
take my ashes...

358
00:36:57,801 --> 00:37:00,500
and place them
in the family shrine...,

359
00:37:00,501 --> 00:37:03,000
in the town of Higuchi.

360
00:37:04,301 --> 00:37:05,400
No, no.

361
00:37:05,501 --> 00:37:07,400
No, I'm not going to...!

362
00:37:12,101 --> 00:37:13,600
Akemi.

363
00:37:14,001 --> 00:37:15,800
I pray you will.

364
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:19,400
"The... snow melts.

365
00:37:20,201 --> 00:37:22,300
Flowers fade.

366
00:37:22,901 --> 00:37:25,200
And I pass...

367
00:37:25,301 --> 00:37:27,800
as all things do."

368
00:37:28,901 --> 00:37:30,500
You...

369
00:37:32,301 --> 00:37:34,800
"But-But time...

370
00:37:34,901 --> 00:37:36,700
and love...,

371
00:37:36,801 --> 00:37:38,900
they go on."

372
00:37:42,601 --> 00:37:45,100
Restore my honor, Xena.

373
00:38:09,401 --> 00:38:11,200
Xena!

374
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:17,500
How will you feel when you come
face-to-face with Akemi's ghost?

375
00:38:17,501 --> 00:38:19,600
Better question is...,

376
00:38:19,601 --> 00:38:23,200
how will Xena feel...
face-to-face...

377
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:27,100
with the ghosts of the people
she killed at Higuchi?!

378
00:38:27,101 --> 00:38:29,000
What?!

379
00:38:29,901 --> 00:38:31,400
Who are you?

380
00:38:31,501 --> 00:38:34,600
My family name is... Harukata.

381
00:38:34,601 --> 00:38:37,900
But he's known as
the killer of ghosts.

382
00:38:38,001 --> 00:38:42,500
- Xena saved your city.
- This time.

383
00:38:43,301 --> 00:38:46,000
But that does nothing to atone...

384
00:38:46,001 --> 00:38:50,200
for what happened...
when last she was here!

385
00:38:51,701 --> 00:38:53,900
What's he talking about?

386
00:38:56,401 --> 00:38:59,800
I was fulfilling
Akemi's dying wish:

387
00:38:59,901 --> 00:39:03,800
to place her ashes
at the family shrine here in Higuchi.

388
00:39:05,201 --> 00:39:07,700
Word got out that I was
honoring the ashes

389
00:39:07,801 --> 00:39:10,500
of a girl
who'd killed her father.

390
00:39:10,601 --> 00:39:14,800
The townsfolk felt that I
would be defiling their graveyard.

391
00:39:15,101 --> 00:39:17,100
They banded together
to stop me.

392
00:39:17,101 --> 00:39:18,500
Xena.

393
00:39:21,801 --> 00:39:23,000
Bitch!

394
00:39:38,201 --> 00:39:39,200
Bitch!

395
00:39:41,501 --> 00:39:43,400
Go home, bitch!

396
00:39:48,401 --> 00:39:50,300
Go home, bitch!

397
00:39:50,901 --> 00:39:52,600
Go away!

398
00:39:52,701 --> 00:39:54,000
She killed her father!

399
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:57,000
Go! Go! Go!

400
00:39:59,101 --> 00:40:01,500
Get out! Get out!

401
00:40:04,801 --> 00:40:06,800
- Get out!
- Get out! Kill her!

402
00:40:06,901 --> 00:40:10,300
I tried to ignore them,
but they came after me.

403
00:40:19,201 --> 00:40:21,000
Xena!

404
00:40:32,601 --> 00:40:34,100
Akemi!

405
00:40:34,201 --> 00:40:35,900
Akemi!

406
00:40:41,401 --> 00:40:42,900
Akemi!

407
00:41:17,501 --> 00:41:19,100
Watch out!

408
00:41:24,701 --> 00:41:27,000
Run! Run; fire! Fire!

409
00:41:41,801 --> 00:41:43,900
The wind took the fire...

410
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,800
from house to house.

411
00:41:46,901 --> 00:41:50,500
40.000 of my townsfolk...

412
00:41:50,601 --> 00:41:53,200
perished... in the flames!

413
00:41:53,301 --> 00:41:55,600
No, it's not possible.

414
00:41:55,701 --> 00:41:59,400
That is... only the beginning!

415
00:41:59,401 --> 00:42:02,000
Akemi told me that
after she killed her father,

416
00:42:02,101 --> 00:42:04,500
Yodoshi's spirit
was so full of evil,

417
00:42:04,601 --> 00:42:07,500
even the underworld
would not allow him to enter.

418
00:42:07,501 --> 00:42:09,600
He became Lord Yodoshi...,

419
00:42:09,701 --> 00:42:11,900
the eater of souls.

420
00:42:11,901 --> 00:42:14,300
Now he holds them...
inside him...,

421
00:42:14,301 --> 00:42:15,500
enslaved.

422
00:42:15,601 --> 00:42:17,300
If that is true...,

423
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:19,400
then I am guilty
of a greater evil

424
00:42:19,401 --> 00:42:20,900
than I ever thought possible.

425
00:42:21,001 --> 00:42:23,300
Xena, it was a horrible accident.

426
00:42:23,401 --> 00:42:25,100
No.

427
00:42:26,301 --> 00:42:29,400
No, I must put things right.

428
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,700
Can you hear them?

429
00:42:36,601 --> 00:42:39,500
I thought I heard a horse
before.

430
00:42:39,501 --> 00:42:41,800
Listen not just to the sounds...,

431
00:42:41,901 --> 00:42:44,700
but to what's behind the sounds.

432
00:43:09,701 --> 00:43:11,000
How many are there?

433
00:43:11,001 --> 00:43:13,300
At least three armies
are gathering.

434
00:43:13,401 --> 00:43:16,700
The general we met
at the water tower was right.

435
00:43:17,101 --> 00:43:20,000
We will meet again
and soon.

436
00:43:22,501 --> 00:43:24,700
I'll warn the others.

437
00:43:45,301 --> 00:43:47,500
Ghost killer...,

438
00:43:48,101 --> 00:43:50,700
I know that you think of me
as your enemy...,

439
00:43:50,701 --> 00:43:53,400
but you must believe this:

440
00:43:53,401 --> 00:43:57,000
my spirit aches
for the torment I've caused.

441
00:44:04,801 --> 00:44:10,500
We both want... the same thing:
to release those souls.

442
00:44:12,201 --> 00:44:15,300
You've devoted your life
to killing Yodoshi.

443
00:44:15,401 --> 00:44:17,500
Why is it
that you have never succeeded?

444
00:44:17,601 --> 00:44:20,700
I have the power...
to slay him.

445
00:44:20,801 --> 00:44:25,000
But it is impossible for me
to get close enough...

446
00:44:25,001 --> 00:44:26,900
to use my blade.

447
00:44:27,001 --> 00:44:28,400
Why?

448
00:44:28,501 --> 00:44:33,200
Because... I am mortal.

449
00:44:34,101 --> 00:44:37,900
Only... another ghost...

450
00:44:37,901 --> 00:44:42,600
can trap... a spirit
as mighty as Yodoshi.

451
00:45:10,601 --> 00:45:16,000
Akemi...,
I know what I must do.

452
00:45:16,001 --> 00:45:19,700
But I'm afraid that this day...

453
00:45:19,701 --> 00:45:23,300
what's done
may not be undone.

454
00:45:25,601 --> 00:45:28,200
Xena, the militia is prepared.

455
00:45:28,501 --> 00:45:30,900
Why aren't you ready?

456
00:45:31,001 --> 00:45:33,200
Gabrielle, come here.

457
00:45:34,501 --> 00:45:37,000
Come here,
give me your hands.

458
00:45:45,501 --> 00:45:47,800
All right.

459
00:45:50,701 --> 00:45:52,300
Here.

460
00:45:53,001 --> 00:45:56,200
Feel the surge of blood
under the skin.

461
00:45:57,201 --> 00:46:00,000
- Now, just behind...
- Xena.

462
00:46:00,401 --> 00:46:02,200
You don't have to do this.

463
00:46:02,201 --> 00:46:04,700
I understand why you would never wanna
teach me the pinch.

464
00:46:04,701 --> 00:46:06,200
No.

465
00:46:06,201 --> 00:46:08,500
No, today
more than ever...

466
00:46:08,601 --> 00:46:11,700
I want you to know
what I know.

467
00:46:12,701 --> 00:46:14,600
Please.

468
00:46:26,401 --> 00:46:28,400
Why are you doing this?

469
00:46:28,501 --> 00:46:30,000
Gabrielle...,

470
00:46:30,001 --> 00:46:33,500
if I only had thirty seconds
to live...

471
00:46:34,401 --> 00:46:37,300
this is how I'd want to live them...,

472
00:46:37,401 --> 00:46:40,500
looking into your eyes.

473
00:46:42,601 --> 00:46:45,200
Stop this.

474
00:46:45,301 --> 00:46:47,000
Stop it.

475
00:46:47,101 --> 00:46:50,000
Always remember: I love you.

476
00:46:57,001 --> 00:46:59,400
Why would you teach me this
right now?

477
00:46:59,401 --> 00:47:01,800
I don't understand!

478
00:47:03,201 --> 00:47:05,900
There's nothing to understand.

479
00:47:06,901 --> 00:47:10,600
I just wanted you to know
everything I know.

480
00:47:18,401 --> 00:47:20,600
Are you ready?

481
00:47:22,201 --> 00:47:25,300
Let's go,
we got a battle to win.

482
00:47:35,701 --> 00:47:37,900
Wouldn't it be better
if we stayed with Xena?

483
00:47:38,001 --> 00:47:40,600
Xena wants us to lead
a contingent to the east plain.

484
00:47:40,701 --> 00:47:44,200
She said a group of Yodoshi's
archers are gathering there.

485
00:49:37,301 --> 00:49:39,800
It's too quiet out here.

486
00:49:44,301 --> 00:49:48,100
Gabrielle, what would you do?
(what would you do?)

487
00:49:48,101 --> 00:49:50,500
Listen not just to the sounds...,

488
00:49:50,501 --> 00:49:54,200
but to what's behind the sounds.
(what's behind the sounds.)

489
00:49:54,301 --> 00:49:58,200
Always remember: I love you.
(I love you. [...])

490
00:49:58,201 --> 00:50:01,600
Xena! (Xena!)

491
00:51:53,801 --> 00:51:56,300
Xena!

492
00:54:25,701 --> 00:54:27,700
All right.

493
00:54:31,401 --> 00:54:34,000
Now you asked for it.

494
00:54:59,501 --> 00:55:01,400
Gabrielle!

495
00:55:03,201 --> 00:55:05,300
If I only had thirty seconds
to live...

496
00:55:05,301 --> 00:55:07,500
We're going to be together.

497
00:55:09,601 --> 00:55:11,500
You brought out the best in me.

498
00:55:11,601 --> 00:55:14,000
Gabrielle!

499
00:55:14,601 --> 00:55:16,900
...this is how I'd want to live them...,

500
00:55:17,001 --> 00:55:19,400
looking into your eyes.

501
00:55:52,801 --> 00:55:54,600
Xena!

502
00:57:04,001 --> 00:57:07,200
You came to me
in my dreams...

503
00:57:07,201 --> 00:57:10,100
and I thought it was reality.

504
00:57:14,301 --> 00:57:16,800
Now you come to me
in reality...

505
00:57:18,801 --> 00:57:21,400
and it feels like it's a dream.

506
00:57:24,101 --> 00:57:26,700
Either way,
I'm filled with joy.

507
00:57:34,801 --> 00:57:37,200
The ghost killer.

508
00:57:37,301 --> 00:57:38,900
What's he doing?

509
00:57:39,001 --> 00:57:40,500
His job.

510
00:57:40,501 --> 00:57:42,400
Speeding wandering souls
on their way,

511
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:45,300
before they can be devoured
by Yodoshi.

512
00:57:55,101 --> 00:57:57,000
Perhaps he sees Xena.

513
00:57:57,001 --> 00:57:59,800
Xena is alive!
Do you understand?

514
00:57:59,801 --> 00:58:02,300
She is alive.

515
00:58:08,301 --> 00:58:11,400
I want to write a verse
to express how I feel...,

516
00:58:11,901 --> 00:58:15,000
but there's no poetry
of sufficient beauty.

517
00:58:17,801 --> 00:58:19,800
Akemi...,

518
00:58:20,101 --> 00:58:24,500
I've been in the underworld before,
but it never felt like this.

519
00:58:28,501 --> 00:58:30,600
What's goin' on?

520
00:58:31,301 --> 00:58:32,600
Our bodies...,

521
00:58:32,701 --> 00:58:34,000
they're an illusion...

522
00:58:34,101 --> 00:58:36,600
projected by Yodoshi.

523
00:58:36,901 --> 00:58:39,400
While we are
under his power...

524
00:58:39,401 --> 00:58:42,200
we must obey his will.

525
00:58:49,001 --> 00:58:52,600
Funny, you're just the way
I remember you.

526
00:59:59,701 --> 01:00:02,000
I am at your service,
Lord Yodoshi.

527
01:00:02,001 --> 01:00:04,500
You most certainly are.

528
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,000
An eternity...

529
01:00:06,001 --> 01:00:10,400
of playing the whore
to service my appetite for souls.

530
01:00:25,301 --> 01:00:26,900
Xena...,

531
01:00:26,901 --> 01:00:30,300
I was so worried that you
wouldn't show Yodoshi respect.

532
01:00:30,601 --> 01:00:33,000
He's very dangerous.

533
01:00:33,601 --> 01:00:36,900
It wasn't respect
I was showing him.

534
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:40,000
I have a job to do.

535
01:00:40,001 --> 01:00:43,000
The job
that you called me for.

536
01:00:43,601 --> 01:00:47,300
I'm going to destroy Yodoshi.

537
01:00:47,401 --> 01:00:49,700
It will be very dangerous.

538
01:00:50,401 --> 01:00:53,300
He seems to grow mightier
with each passing day.

539
01:00:53,401 --> 01:00:56,400
You're going to have
to trust me, Akemi.

540
01:00:56,801 --> 01:00:59,300
There's someone
I have to meet...

541
01:00:59,301 --> 01:01:01,600
that can help us.

542
01:01:06,701 --> 01:01:09,300
You know
you are being watched.

543
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:13,000
Akemi, I can still hear

544
01:01:13,101 --> 01:01:14,900
your heart beating.

545
01:01:15,701 --> 01:01:17,100
And I can hear every one

546
01:01:17,201 --> 01:01:20,900
of Myuki's clumsy footfalls.

547
01:01:25,101 --> 01:01:27,500
She'll try to follow me.

548
01:01:30,101 --> 01:01:31,900
Let her.

549
01:01:53,701 --> 01:01:54,900
Shh.

550
01:01:55,001 --> 01:01:57,100
I saw something.

551
01:01:57,901 --> 01:02:01,400
The samurai may have
Xena captive.

552
01:02:02,001 --> 01:02:04,000
We'll split up.

553
01:03:11,701 --> 01:03:14,600
- Xena.
- Gabrielle.

554
01:03:18,201 --> 01:03:19,600
What are you doing here?

555
01:03:19,701 --> 01:03:22,500
I was so worried about you.

556
01:03:22,601 --> 01:03:24,000
I found your chakram.

557
01:03:24,101 --> 01:03:26,400
There's so much blood.

558
01:03:27,101 --> 01:03:29,500
I'm all right.

559
01:03:30,201 --> 01:03:32,700
What's with the robes?

560
01:03:34,001 --> 01:03:38,000
Gabrielle, I'm going to kill
the Lord of the Dark Land.

561
01:03:39,501 --> 01:03:41,500
You'll need this.

562
01:03:51,401 --> 01:03:54,100
I can't take that.

563
01:03:57,101 --> 01:04:00,000
It's difficult to explain.

564
01:04:01,801 --> 01:04:04,100
You're dead.

565
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:08,600
How could you let yourself
be killed?

566
01:04:08,701 --> 01:04:11,300
I'm sorry, Gabrielle,
I couldn't tell you.

567
01:04:11,401 --> 01:04:14,500
You'd have tried to stop me,
and then we'd both be dead.

568
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:18,100
Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

569
01:04:18,401 --> 01:04:21,400
We've overcome death before.

570
01:04:21,401 --> 01:04:23,700
We will find a way
to bring me back.

571
01:04:23,801 --> 01:04:26,700
But only by becoming a spirit
can I kill Yodoshi

572
01:04:26,801 --> 01:04:30,200
and free those souls
that I condemned to torment.

573
01:04:30,201 --> 01:04:32,800
Don't you see that?

574
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:42,600
You're my whole life,
Xena.

575
01:04:43,901 --> 01:04:46,200
I won't lose you.

576
01:04:46,301 --> 01:04:48,400
You won't lose me.

577
01:04:54,801 --> 01:04:57,900
Harukata,
don't you come near her.

578
01:04:59,401 --> 01:05:02,300
Put down your weapons, Gabrielle.

579
01:05:02,401 --> 01:05:05,000
He's working with me.

580
01:05:28,701 --> 01:05:30,500
The anklet!

581
01:06:06,701 --> 01:06:10,500
With this, we can bring Yodoshi
to us when we're ready.

582
01:06:23,801 --> 01:06:28,600
This is my soul mate.
She's a poet like you, Akemi.

583
01:06:32,701 --> 01:06:34,600
I have one question.

584
01:06:34,901 --> 01:06:38,100
Would you risk your life...

585
01:06:38,201 --> 01:06:40,700
for the return of hers?

586
01:06:40,801 --> 01:06:43,200
Without hesitation.

587
01:06:43,701 --> 01:06:46,000
There is a way, Gabrielle.

588
01:06:46,001 --> 01:06:49,200
You must take her body,
burn it...,

589
01:06:49,201 --> 01:06:50,800
then sprinkle the ashes

590
01:06:50,801 --> 01:06:53,700
into the Fountain of Strength
on Mount Fuji.

591
01:06:54,001 --> 01:06:58,100
You must find the fountain before
the second sunset after death.

592
01:06:58,101 --> 01:07:00,200
That's tomorrow.

593
01:07:00,201 --> 01:07:02,700
Harukata will say
the incantations necessary...

594
01:07:02,801 --> 01:07:06,600
to give the sacred katana
power against malicious spirits.

595
01:07:08,001 --> 01:07:09,900
Gabrielle.

596
01:07:16,801 --> 01:07:19,100
This is Akemi.

597
01:07:25,001 --> 01:07:27,100
It is an honor to meet you
at last.

598
01:07:27,101 --> 01:07:29,400
And you, Akemi.

599
01:07:29,701 --> 01:07:32,200
Gabrielle can't help
with our work in the tea house.

600
01:07:32,301 --> 01:07:35,900
She knows what she must do,
and she should leave soon.

601
01:07:39,801 --> 01:07:41,700
Thank you.

602
01:07:47,401 --> 01:07:48,900
Wait.

603
01:07:49,801 --> 01:07:51,900
I would like to give you something...

604
01:07:52,001 --> 01:07:54,800
to protect you on your journey.

605
01:09:21,301 --> 01:09:23,700
Good luck, old friend.

606
01:09:28,601 --> 01:09:33,000
I am getting your body back, Xena,
no matter where they have hidden it.

607
01:09:33,101 --> 01:09:36,700
Before sunset tomorrow,
we will meet again...

608
01:09:36,701 --> 01:09:39,500
on the side of Mount Fujisan.

609
01:09:48,301 --> 01:09:50,300
See you there.

610
01:11:01,101 --> 01:11:04,200
Give me her head!

611
01:11:43,501 --> 01:11:48,600
I've been expecting you.
Your friend was a fine opponent.

612
01:11:48,701 --> 01:11:51,100
She provided me
with one of the greatest trophies

613
01:11:51,201 --> 01:11:54,000
an honorable samurai
could ever claim.

614
01:11:54,001 --> 01:11:55,900
You call yourself honorable?

615
01:11:55,901 --> 01:11:59,600
You outnumbered her
a thousand to one.

616
01:12:00,401 --> 01:12:03,600
You're not a samurai,
you're a fraud.

617
01:12:03,701 --> 01:12:06,800
You couldn't've killed Xena
unless she wanted you to.

618
01:12:06,901 --> 01:12:10,000
I think it's you
with a death wish!

619
01:12:10,001 --> 01:12:12,500
I accept the challenge.

620
01:12:59,501 --> 01:13:02,300
Listen not just to the sounds...,

621
01:13:04,301 --> 01:13:08,500
but to what's behind the sounds.
(behind the sounds.)

622
01:14:38,201 --> 01:14:43,200
It was the greatest honor of my life...
to send Xena to an early grave.

623
01:14:43,301 --> 01:14:45,900
If I cannot
do the same to you...,

624
01:14:46,201 --> 01:14:50,000
then I ask you...
to grant me a noble defeat.

625
01:14:50,101 --> 01:14:53,500
Please, remove my head
in one stroke.

626
01:16:08,401 --> 01:16:10,200
Good.

627
01:16:13,601 --> 01:16:15,200
Huh?

628
01:16:16,501 --> 01:16:18,100
Where is Miyuki?!

629
01:16:44,401 --> 01:16:45,900
Where is he?

630
01:17:13,001 --> 01:17:14,900
Duck!

631
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:55,800
We finally meet,
ghost killer.

632
01:18:23,301 --> 01:18:24,800
Akemi.

633
01:18:32,901 --> 01:18:34,500
Akemi.

634
01:18:37,401 --> 01:18:40,400
Akemi. Are you all right?

635
01:18:59,001 --> 01:19:01,800
Harukata, what went wrong?

636
01:19:03,501 --> 01:19:05,500
There is...

637
01:19:05,601 --> 01:19:08,900
only one explanation.

638
01:19:09,001 --> 01:19:11,300
He's drinking...

639
01:19:11,301 --> 01:19:15,800
from the Fountain of Strength
on Mount Fuji.

640
01:19:16,501 --> 01:19:21,300
If you drink...
from the fountain...

641
01:19:21,401 --> 01:19:25,100
and use... the sword
I blessed...,

642
01:19:25,201 --> 01:19:31,100
it will be the final destruction...
for any spirit.

643
01:19:31,501 --> 01:19:32,600
Xena...,

644
01:19:32,701 --> 01:19:34,900
my soul...

645
01:19:35,001 --> 01:19:38,700
will soon join the others...,

646
01:19:38,801 --> 01:19:40,600
trapped in...

647
01:19:40,701 --> 01:19:43,200
Yodoshi's grasp.

648
01:19:43,301 --> 01:19:47,200
You must finish a job...

649
01:19:47,301 --> 01:19:51,300
and release us all.

650
01:19:56,401 --> 01:19:59,400
I will not rest
till it is done.

651
01:20:11,601 --> 01:20:14,500
I can't let you die.

652
01:20:14,801 --> 01:20:18,400
If I only had thirty seconds
to live...

653
01:20:19,301 --> 01:20:22,200
this is how I'd want to live them...,

654
01:20:22,301 --> 01:20:25,000
looking into your eyes.

655
01:20:25,401 --> 01:20:30,100
Even in death, Gabrielle...,
I will never leave you.

656
01:20:30,201 --> 01:20:33,100
You will return to me,
my friend.

657
01:21:17,901 --> 01:21:20,300
Yodoshi a hawk?

658
01:21:20,801 --> 01:21:22,300
Even with his injuries,
in bird form,

659
01:21:22,401 --> 01:21:24,300
he could make Fujisan
in half a day.

660
01:21:24,301 --> 01:21:26,500
Yes, but he's weakened.

661
01:21:26,601 --> 01:21:27,900
We're no longer confined

662
01:21:28,001 --> 01:21:30,100
to these physical illusions.

663
01:21:30,101 --> 01:21:32,500
We could change
into other vessels.

664
01:21:32,501 --> 01:21:34,400
What about them?

665
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:39,800
Yes.

666
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:41,300
Good.

667
01:21:41,401 --> 01:21:43,100
Xena.

668
01:21:43,701 --> 01:21:44,700
Gabrielle...

669
01:21:44,701 --> 01:21:47,400
is on her way
to Mount Fujisan.

670
01:21:47,401 --> 01:21:48,400
And...

671
01:21:48,501 --> 01:21:49,900
if she succeeds...

672
01:21:49,901 --> 01:21:52,100
She'll succeed,
don't worry.

673
01:21:52,201 --> 01:21:55,300
She's very good
at what she does.

674
01:21:55,601 --> 01:21:56,900
I'm so sorry.

675
01:21:57,001 --> 01:21:59,100
Akemi...,

676
01:22:00,201 --> 01:22:02,200
what's wrong?

677
01:22:04,901 --> 01:22:06,600
I have to tell you...

678
01:22:06,701 --> 01:22:08,200
what must be done...

679
01:22:08,301 --> 01:22:10,700
to save those souls...,

680
01:22:10,701 --> 01:22:13,500
but I feel my own soul
is doomed...

681
01:22:13,801 --> 01:22:16,600
for what I'm about
to tell you.

682
01:22:25,701 --> 01:22:26,900
I know that you did

683
01:22:26,901 --> 01:22:29,700
what you thought you had to,
Akemi.

684
01:22:30,701 --> 01:22:33,800
And perhaps by releasing
those souls...,

685
01:22:33,801 --> 01:22:36,500
we'll all be redeemed.

686
01:22:50,101 --> 01:22:51,800
Come on.

687
01:23:08,601 --> 01:23:09,700
You'll come to regret

688
01:23:09,701 --> 01:23:11,100
not allowing me
a warrior's death.

689
01:23:11,101 --> 01:23:14,400
It's not too late to put that right!

690
01:23:17,101 --> 01:23:21,700
I will not allow you to find
the fountain... and revive your friend.

691
01:24:13,001 --> 01:24:14,400
No!

692
01:24:15,201 --> 01:24:17,400
No! No!

693
01:25:19,601 --> 01:25:22,200
Come on. Come on!

694
01:25:49,701 --> 01:25:51,400
What?

695
01:25:54,401 --> 01:25:56,500
My own daughter?!

696
01:25:59,801 --> 01:26:01,800
Akemi!

697
01:26:29,501 --> 01:26:31,200
Xena?

698
01:26:58,701 --> 01:27:00,300
Xena?

699
01:27:01,901 --> 01:27:03,700
Xena.

700
01:27:06,901 --> 01:27:09,900
Xena..., what happened?

701
01:27:39,301 --> 01:27:41,700
Told you I'd see you here.

702
01:28:04,601 --> 01:28:09,400
The Fountain of Strength...
Get water...

703
01:28:09,401 --> 01:28:13,100
Fountain... Water...

704
01:29:16,701 --> 01:29:18,600
Gabrielle...

705
01:29:30,401 --> 01:29:36,300
Gabrielle, I need the sacred katana
to finish the job. Thank you.

706
01:29:39,101 --> 01:29:44,000
The sun is setting, Xena.
I have to find your ashes.

707
01:29:44,301 --> 01:29:47,700
- Gabrielle...
- Come on!

708
01:29:55,601 --> 01:29:57,000
Gab...

709
01:30:44,501 --> 01:30:46,400
Enough of this!

710
01:32:16,101 --> 01:32:20,900
You are about to join the 40.000
souls you condemned, Xena.

711
01:32:20,901 --> 01:32:22,300
And the first thing I'll do...

712
01:32:22,301 --> 01:32:26,100
is take the head off
your little friend with the tatoo.

713
01:32:28,501 --> 01:32:31,400
You won't live that long.

714
01:33:34,601 --> 01:33:37,600
I deserve the dignity
of a warrior.

715
01:33:37,701 --> 01:33:42,800
Dignity, huh?
Like you showed my friend?

716
01:34:00,101 --> 01:34:04,200
- Xena.
- Akemi.

717
01:34:04,301 --> 01:34:08,500
You've redeemed me.
You've redeemed them!

718
01:34:08,901 --> 01:34:14,400
- You've redeemed yourself!
- Go in peace, Akemi.

719
01:34:15,701 --> 01:34:19,900
We'll meet again...
one day.

720
01:34:36,201 --> 01:34:39,000
- No, Gabrielle.
- Xena.

721
01:34:39,501 --> 01:34:43,000
- No.
- Xena..., the sun is setting.

722
01:34:43,101 --> 01:34:46,400
- I have to bring you back to life.
- No.

723
01:34:46,501 --> 01:34:51,900
Not if it means condemning the souls
of the 40.000 who burned at Higuchi.

724
01:34:53,001 --> 01:34:57,400
- The souls are free.
- They're free from Yodoshi's grasp.

725
01:34:57,501 --> 01:35:01,500
Akemi didn't wanna tell me this
in case I wouldn't come back to help...,

726
01:35:01,801 --> 01:35:06,100
but for those souls to be released
into a state of grace...,

727
01:35:06,601 --> 01:35:09,300
they must be avenged.

728
01:35:12,201 --> 01:35:15,000
I must stay dead.

729
01:35:19,101 --> 01:35:24,000
- But if I bring you back to life...
- Those souls will be lost forever.

730
01:35:29,001 --> 01:35:30,800
Xena...

731
01:35:37,101 --> 01:35:40,000
That is not right.

732
01:35:48,201 --> 01:35:50,500
I don't care.

733
01:35:53,501 --> 01:35:56,100
- You're all that matters to me.
- Don't you know

734
01:35:56,201 --> 01:36:01,200
how much I wanna let you do this?
But if there is a reason

735
01:36:01,301 --> 01:36:07,200
for our travels together..., it's
because I had to learn from you...

736
01:36:08,601 --> 01:36:13,600
enough to know the final, the good,
the right thing to do.

737
01:36:15,401 --> 01:36:18,300
I can't come back.

738
01:36:21,301 --> 01:36:23,500
I can't.

739
01:36:33,301 --> 01:36:39,300
I love you, Xena. How am I supposed
to go on without you?

740
01:36:41,701 --> 01:36:44,500
I'll always be with you,
Gabrielle.

741
01:36:49,301 --> 01:36:51,200
Always.

742
01:37:33,801 --> 01:37:35,800
Xena.

743
01:37:54,001 --> 01:37:58,100
A life of journeying has brought you
to the farthest lands...,

744
01:37:58,101 --> 01:38:01,000
to the very edges of the Earth.

745
01:38:07,101 --> 01:38:12,500
And to the place where
I'll always remain: your heart.

746
01:38:15,101 --> 01:38:18,900
- So, where to now?
- I think we should go south,

747
01:38:19,001 --> 01:38:23,800
to the land of the pharaohs. I hear
they need a girl with a chakram.

748
01:38:24,601 --> 01:38:29,000
Where you go...,
I'm at your side.

749
01:38:30,001 --> 01:38:32,700
I knew you'd say that.

750
01:38:57,001 --> 01:39:02,000
