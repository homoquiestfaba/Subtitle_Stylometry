00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:13,940
(Addison)
It's not in
the right position!

183
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,276
What the hell?
All this time you've
been working with me,

184
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:17,810
you should know where
to put it!

Oh, I don't want--
Why did I--

00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,772
(groaning)

216
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,985
Thank you.
Ah...

217
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:10,456
(Elaine)
Dear Mr. Skyler,

218
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,660
your letter is
surprisingly poetic.

219
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,228
My goodness.

220
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:18,998
You will be
an interesting pen pal indeed.

221
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,634
I teach the first grade
in our local elementary school,

222
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:26,205
and I love the enthusiasm
of six-year-olds.

223
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:30,309
I live with my father
in the same house I was raised.

224
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,811
I take care of him

225
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:35,715
as he is an invalid
bound to a wheelchair.

226
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:37,083
Oh, there are moments,

227
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,818
when I look
at a brilliant sunrise,

228
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,320
for instance,
and then I think

229
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,391
of what other kind of life
I might have led...

230
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:48,828
out there beyond the horizon...

231
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:53,466
in some exotic place.

232
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:56,569
But those are silly thoughts.

233
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,471
Enough about me.

234
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:00,273
Now, you tell me who you are.

235
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:01,607
Write to me.

236
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,976
I look forward
to your next letter.

237
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:07,113
Sincerely, Elaine Hodges.

238
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:11,317
(Charlie)
Dear Elaine,

239
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,953
I'm sorry to hear
about your father,

240
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:18,224
but with due respect,
I could puke at your letter.

241
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:21,828
You piss on your freedom,
but it's the only thing

242
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:23,963
that makes you something.

243
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:31,504
But choose a door
and open the damn thing.

244
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:39,078
Did I tell you I'm a cook
in the prison galley?

245
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:43,416
It is slop, I'm afraid,
but I can't cook what I choose.

246
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:49,822
One day, I will.

247
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,457
One day.

248
00:14:58,164 --> 00:15:00,566
(Charlie)
Hey.

249
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,135
Hey!

250
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:05,571
Boy, everything you touch
ends up smelling like an armpit!

251
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,276
Son of a-- oh!

252
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:13,279
(whimpering)

253
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,280
Oh!

254
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:22,889
(Charlie)
Tell me about your father
and what he's told you.

255
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:28,261
He's crippled.

256
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:31,831
Why is he
in a wheelchair?

257
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:34,834
And what put him there?

258
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:36,335
I need to know.

259
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:41,974
Yours truly,
Charles S. Skyler.

260
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:46,279
P.S.

261
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:50,449
Your letter
smells of perfume.

262
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,152
I thank you.

263
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:57,123
(Addison)
What are you doing here?
Get out of my house!

264
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,624
Are you out of your mind?

265
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,427
(woman)
There's a gun!
Addison!

266
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,663
(Addison)
You shot my wife!

267
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:05,631
Oh! Aah!
(gun clicking)

268
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,633
(woman)
Oh, my...

269
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,635
(gunshot echoing)

270
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:22,548
(Elaine)
Dear Charlie,

271
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:25,084
late at night,
when I was six years old,

272
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:29,455
an intruder murdered my mother,
crippled my father,

273
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,657
and then committed suicide.

274
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,260
My father
will not discuss it.

275
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,597
If I try and talk about it,
he gets angry.

276
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:40,633
Sometimes he stops talking to me
altogether for days.

277
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:42,168
(Addison)
That's it!

278
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:45,137
(Elaine)
You should not
judge me harshly.

279
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:47,473
He's my father.

280
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:50,243
And if a person has no loyalty
to their own family,

281
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:54,247
then I... I simply just
don't know what else there is.

282
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:58,117
I live the way I do
because it's what I want.

283
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:04,490
I'm sorry,
but you've touched a nerve.

284
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,225
There is a door to open.

285
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,761
Let it be your own.

286
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:12,131
I will join you in prayer
for that day.

287
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:14,634
Sincerely, Elaine Hodges.

288
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:27,747
(man)
Have a seat, Charlie.

289
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,322
(door closes)

290
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,993
Okay, Charlie.

291
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,795
Your time's up.
You're out.

292
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:46,966
But... I think
you're a bad bet.

293
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:48,467
All you've ever known
is trouble

294
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:51,137
and the four walls
of your cell.

295
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:52,138
You'll be back.

296
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:55,074
(Charlie clears throat)

297
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,978
Yeah, I'm not a threat
to anybody.

298
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:03,649
All I wanna do is put my life
back together

299
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:05,785
and get a job.

300
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:08,821
'Cause I got a skill now.

301
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:12,892
I could be a fry cook to start
and maybe...

302
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:15,461
maybe someday work
in a fancy restaurant.

303
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:21,767
You won't see me again.

304
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:25,271
See, this time...

305
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,973
I'm out for good.

306
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:29,308
Somebody cares now.

307
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,477
I'm not alone.

308
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,579
I want to be a part
of that world out there.

309
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:36,349
And I don't want
to hurt anybody.

310
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:43,889
I just want to be a part
of that world.

311
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,494
I can taste it.

312
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:30,169
(phone ringing)

313
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:35,941
(phone continues ringing)

314
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,076
Hello?

315
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:40,346
Just a minute.
It's for you!

316
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:44,116
Gentleman caller.

317
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:47,453
(Elaine)
Hello?

318
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:49,088
Elaine, hi.

319
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:50,423
Hi.

320
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:52,091
(Addison)
Your pasta
is turning to paste!

321
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:53,959
We, uh...
didn't get a chance

322
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:56,328
to, uh, speak at the school.

323
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:58,964
Weren't the kids cute?
<i> Yeah.</i>

324
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:01,934
You looked really,
really beautiful.

325
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:06,572
<i> I've been thinking a lot</i>
<i> about you lately.</i>

326
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:09,008
If it's true love,
he'll call you back!

327
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:11,343
(Addison)
Blah, blah, blah.
Mm-hmm?

328
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,779
Talk to him
about your menopause!

329
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:15,281
That'll shut him up!

330
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:24,423
(Elaine)
Yeah, I'm... good.

331
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,596
No.

332
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:34,400
Mm-hmm.

333
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,401
(grunts)

334
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,403
(clock chiming)

335
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:44,143
(Elaine)
Mm-hmm.

336
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:49,582
(Timothy)
<i> Do you think...</i>

337
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,450
<i> we could get together?</i>

338
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,285
<i> A cup of coffee</i>
<i> or something?</i>

339
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,286
(grunts)

340
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,623
Elaine!

341
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:58,791
(groans)

342
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,626
There you go.

343
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:03,129
Your legs are burnt,
but I doubt they'll blister.

344
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:05,131
I wish I would die.

345
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:06,332
Now, now.

346
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:08,801
Just a foolish,
helpless old man.

347
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:11,237
Shh, you just rest.
You'll be all right.

348
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:14,607
I'd be lost
if you weren't here.

349
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:17,676
I couldn't take care of myself.
You know that.

350
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:19,512
Daddy...

351
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:23,516
What did Tim--
uh, why was he calling?

352
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:25,284
Just to stay in touch.

353
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,788
Oh, well, you'd have never
been happy with him, never.

354
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,489
Well, don't leave.

355
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,024
I'm not going anywhere.

356
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:34,627
No, I mean now.
Sit, huh?

357
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,962
Stay with me
till I go to sleep, please.

358
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,130
Okay.

359
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:42,635
(bed whirring)

360
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,637
(Addison groaning)

361
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,078
No.

362
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:55,314
No, you never would've
been happy with him.

363
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,849
Never, no.

364
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,532
(dog barking in distance)

365
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:03,148
(indistinct chatter on TV)

366
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:05,351
I've gotta go now.
Early day for me.

367
00:23:05,351 --> 00:23:07,253
What? What? What?

368
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:11,490
(slowly)
I've got to go now.

369
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,524
Why?

370
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,526
It's my birthday.

371
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:18,797
Oh... you wake me up
just for that?

372
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:21,000
Well, I just thought
you should know I was leaving

373
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,603
in case you decided
to choke yourself to death.

374
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:26,405
Have you got any money on you?

375
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,974
Oh, if I did,
I wouldn't give any to you.

376
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:30,809
No, I mean borrow it.

377
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:33,345
With you, loaning it
is the same as giving it.

378
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:34,947
I'll pay it right back.

379
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:36,415
Huh?
10 bucks?

380
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,984
Just as soon as tear it up,
throw it to the wind.

381
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:40,252
So, go.

382
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,621
Stop making such
a big production out of it.

383
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:44,323
Hope you don't have
a car accident.

384
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:53,132
I bet you can't
swallow one whole.

385
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:55,134
(plate clatters)

386
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,840
"I.O.U."

387
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,002
(Charlie)
Dear Elaine,

388
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,938
by the time
you get this letter,

389
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:10,309
I will be a free man,
released.

390
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:12,444
I credit your prayers.

391
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:17,449
(mimics engine revving)

392
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:20,419
I've dreamed of my freedom
for so long,

393
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:23,355
but it's not a life I know.

394
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:27,626
And it's one I've been denied
so many times before.

395
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:30,429
They said things
at the prison.

396
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:33,832
They think I will fail.

397
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:38,637
My blood runs cold when I hear
their words because...

398
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:40,672
I'm afraid they're true.

399
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:47,146
That's why I need you, Elaine.

400
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:50,949
I'm setting sail
with no compass.

401
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:53,619
You will be my eyes.

402
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:56,321
You'll speak the language.

403
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,624
And you need me, Elaine,

404
00:25:58,624 --> 00:26:02,828
in ways that you
don't even know.

405
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:04,630
The key you hold in your hand

406
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:07,966
will unlock nothing less
than the truth.

407
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:15,107
(knocking on window)
(gasps)

408
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:16,508
Oh...

409
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,511
Hector.

410
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:23,081
You're very nervous,
Elaine.

411
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,017
Do you want to speak to me
about something?

412
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:26,919
I got heart palpitations.

413
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,187
They say it's nothing,

414
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:31,490
but I go to an HMO,
and I don't trust them.

415
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,958
Mm-hmm.

416
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:35,160
Your father was
a wonderful doctor.

417
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,629
It's too bad he doesn't
practice anymore.

418
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:39,431
Yeah.

419
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,999
I'm sorry to cut you off.
I'm gonna have to go.

420
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:43,001
Does he ever think
of coming out of retirement?

421
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:45,871
Oh, I don't think so.
I gotta go now, Hector.

422
00:26:45,871 --> 00:26:48,340
Okay, well, let me know
if he changes his mind.

423
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,008
Okey-doke.

424
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:07,159
(clock chiming)

425
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:09,194
(dishes clattering)

426
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:41,193
Oh, darn!

427
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:43,795
I banged into the sideboard,
damn it.

428
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:45,164
Broke this family heirloom.

429
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,632
Bull.

430
00:27:46,632 --> 00:27:50,035
This vase has been
in the family
for generations.

431
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:52,538
I gotta fix it
before Elaine comes home.

432
00:27:52,538 --> 00:27:54,640
Came all the way from...
Scandinavia, damn it!

433
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,142
Looks more like
the five-and-dime to me.

434
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:59,444
You'd be heartbroken,
you would be,

435
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:01,213
if you knocked over
something like that,

436
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:03,348
like an elephant tusk
or something

437
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:07,185
that your great-grandmammy
lugged all the way over
on a slave ship.

438
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,454
I ought to push you
off a cliff.

439
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:10,956
Come on, Edna,
help me!

440
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:13,458
And why should I help you?

441
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:15,627
Get the glue for me.
It's down in the basement.

442
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:17,596
It's probably on a work bench.

443
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:19,264
How do you know
what's down there?

444
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:20,632
My basement,
isn't it?

445
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:23,335
Huh?
Mm-hmm.

446
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:25,837
Aye, good girl,
good girl.

447
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:44,656
(locks clicking)

448
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:45,824
(Edna)
Let me out of here!

449
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:47,960
Wait!
Let me out of here!

450
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,796
(Edna pounding on door)
Rat-faced snake-hearted gimp!

451
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:05,344
(exhales)

452
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:28,166
(indistinct chatter on TV)

453
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:41,513
(meat sizzling)

454
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:47,853
(bell ringing)

455
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,001
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

456
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,007
Say, you like your cook?

457
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:45,010
Well, he shows up,
works hard.

458
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,845
I got no complaints,
I guess.

459
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,847
(door closes)

460
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,615
How come?

461
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:54,653
Mm-hmm.
Just curious, I guess.

462
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:56,822
I'm a chef.

463
00:30:56,822 --> 00:30:58,156
Oh, yeah?

464
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:01,526
American or, uh, cuisine?

465
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,995
Uh, French.
Uh-huh.

466
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:05,430
Yeah, you might've heard
of it.

467
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:09,000
It's called,
uh, "En Prison."

468
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,536
Oh, yeah, I think I heard
of that place, yeah, sure.

469
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,971
Right on.
Whoa! Oh!

470
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:16,174
Holy cow.
Hey! Fire!

471
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:18,777
I got it! I got it!
What's going on in here?

472
00:31:18,777 --> 00:31:20,345
I got it!
All right!

473
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:24,182
(overlapping shouting)

474
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:28,186
He got out
and he knows where I live.

475
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:30,188
I closed my post-office box,
and this morning,

476
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:33,024
that one came
to the house.

477
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:36,027
It unnerved me.

478
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:39,498
I don't know what
I was thinking.

479
00:31:39,498 --> 00:31:41,867
What can you expect
from a person like that?

480
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:43,668
It's okay.

481
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:45,270
We all make mistakes.

482
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:52,010
It was nice to hear from you
the other night.

483
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,546
It was nice talking to you.

484
00:31:54,546 --> 00:31:56,882
Look, I'll, uh...
I'll go talk to him.

485
00:31:56,882 --> 00:31:58,984
Thank you.
Anytime.

486
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:03,321
I don't mean
to overreact.

487
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:05,157
He seemed
a little crazy and--

488
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:06,825
I'll take care of it.

489
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:10,195
You make a handsome family.

490
00:32:10,195 --> 00:32:12,030
It's worked out for me.

491
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,865
Some thing's
I'd never change.

492
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:20,505
The woman I married
wasn't my first choice.

493
00:32:23,642 --> 00:32:27,179
You know, I, uh, I looked out
my window the other night.

494
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:30,182
I could swear
I saw you watching us.

495
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:36,354
Were you?

496
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:38,323
I need your help.

497
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:53,505
Let me talk
to your cook.

498
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:55,207
Sure.

499
00:32:55,207 --> 00:32:57,509
Oh, he's a trained chef,
by the way.

500
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:00,946
(Charlie groaning)

501
00:33:00,946 --> 00:33:03,782
Elaine and I go back a long way,
and she's had a hard go,

502
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:06,651
and I'm not gonna
let scum like you
make it any harder for her.

503
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,520
You understand?

504
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,689
You've been warned, Charlie.

505
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:18,663
(panting and groaning)

506
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:19,664
What's going on here?

507
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:30,342
(indistinct chatter)

508
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:31,543
(Charlie)
There you go, Miss.

509
00:33:31,543 --> 00:33:32,644
(woman)
Thank you.

510
00:33:32,644 --> 00:33:35,046
You're new.

511
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:36,948
Hey, I started last week.

512
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:38,817
You cook this?

513
00:33:38,817 --> 00:33:40,619
Was there something wrong
with it?

514
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,358
I wanna shake your hand.

515
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:47,859
You, sir, are a genius.

516
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,527
I've never seen
anything like--

517
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:54,165
(stammering)
Who'd have thought...
this cheese?

518
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:57,035
Explain the...

519
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,971
Well, that's cream cheese.
It's, um, it's herbed.

520
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:02,040
"Herbed"?

521
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,009
Yeah, it's, um...

522
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:07,212
it's tarragon,
savory, thyme,

523
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:09,347
little salt and pepper,

524
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:12,117
and the tiniest bit of mint.

525
00:34:12,117 --> 00:34:14,853
Yeah, I experimented
with the mint, actually.

526
00:34:14,853 --> 00:34:19,024
This is the best cheese omelet
I've ever eaten in my life.

527
00:34:19,024 --> 00:34:21,126
I appreciate that.

528
00:34:21,126 --> 00:34:23,361
Stick around, sir.

529
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:25,196
Gourmet.
Nothing less.

530
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,470
(Charlie)
Dear Elaine,

531
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:36,841
I said I meant you no harm,
but you're hiding from me.

532
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:38,677
Why?

533
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:42,147
I've done nothing to hurt you.

534
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:45,350
We can help each other.
I know it.

535
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,552
We can help each other be free
of everything

536
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:49,854
that's gone wrong
in the past.

537
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:53,491
You don't deserve the life
you've been forced to lead.

538
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:57,162
And I can say the same
about myself.

539
00:34:57,162 --> 00:34:59,898
Though we're so different,
we're kindred.

540
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:03,201
We're family to each other.

541
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:06,871
And you'll come
to know that in time.

542
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:09,541
In time.

543
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:11,109
So don't cry.

544
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:14,379
Don't be afraid.

545
00:35:14,379 --> 00:35:19,050
Your friend,
Charles S. Skyler.

546
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:25,523
Hello?

547
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:44,943
(Charlie)
I could smell your perfume
from down the hall.

548
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:46,978
Mr. Skyler.
Mmm.

549
00:35:48,847 --> 00:35:51,516
Your--
The door was open.

550
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:55,153
So, dear Elaine.

551
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,155
I'm glad you came.

552
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,189
Thought you would.

553
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:02,961
I don't believe
in locked doors.

554
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:12,871
You look as pretty
as your picture.

555
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:15,874
I'm not sure what you thought
you'd accomplish by coming here.

556
00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:17,876
You should never have come
to this town.

557
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:26,951
You never thought I'd get out.
Right, Elaine?

558
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:29,387
Well, I understand.

559
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:31,489
I do.

560
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,494
You wanna hear
something true?

561
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:38,029
Some die behind bars,

562
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,799
but most get out
one day or another.

563
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:42,967
It's time and will.

564
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:44,869
That's the secret.

565
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,705
I volunteered to correspond
with a pen pal.

566
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,641
That was all.

567
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:51,509
If I misled you
in any way

568
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:54,679
about my life or my intentions,
I'm sorry, that was wrong.

569
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,648
But you frightened me
coming here.

570
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:58,650
And that lieutenant?

571
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,051
Is he a friend of yours?

572
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:04,289
Did you send him
to frighten me?

573
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:07,992
He enjoys his power.

574
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:09,861
But he's weak,
you know?

575
00:37:14,132 --> 00:37:16,034
I seen that look
a thousand times

576
00:37:16,034 --> 00:37:18,536
in a guard's eyes,
standing over me.

577
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:27,712
I liked your letters.

578
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:29,547
"Dear Charlie.

579
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:33,718
Dear Charlie,"
and "Sincerely, Elaine."

580
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:37,322
That's a nice way for people
to talk to each other, isn't it?

581
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:38,656
It's decent.

582
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:40,125
Why are you here?

583
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:46,197
You tell me about it,
that night a long time ago.

584
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:47,699
What?

585
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:50,001
The night
your father was shot,

586
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:52,337
your mama murdered.

587
00:37:52,337 --> 00:37:55,874
Why?
Because it's important.

588
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:59,544
Cruel things like that,
they shape a person's life.

589
00:37:59,544 --> 00:38:01,346
That's true.
And they say it helps

590
00:38:01,346 --> 00:38:03,515
to talk about things
that hurt the most.

591
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:05,116
Well, you're hardly the person
I would talk to--

592
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,385
Losing everything so soon,

593
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:09,487
it's like tying an arm
behind your back

594
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:11,623
and pushing you off a plank.

595
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:14,959
How you gonna learn to swim?
It's not fair.

596
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,194
I appreciate your concern.

597
00:38:16,194 --> 00:38:18,730
I'm proud of you though,
Elaine.

598
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:21,666
You sacrificed.
You kept yourself pure.

599
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:23,067
I could never
have done that.

600
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:25,303
Look, Mr. Skyler--
It's Charlie.

601
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,871
Charlie, I don't--

602
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:29,174
With everything
that happened to you,

603
00:38:29,174 --> 00:38:33,711
with everything you'd given up
and lost...

604
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:34,913
you never hurt anybody.

605
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:36,681
Why would I want
to hurt anyone?

606
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:39,083
Well, you'd be surprised.

607
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:40,451
Yeah.

608
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:43,688
See, a guy like me
could learn from you.

609
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:46,191
I need you more than
I can put into words.

610
00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:48,026
Everything good
that could happen to me

611
00:38:48,026 --> 00:38:49,394
from this point on
depends on you.

612
00:38:49,394 --> 00:38:50,795
Don't say that.

613
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:52,797
The world and I,
we're at odds.

614
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:54,732
And they know that
back where I came from.

615
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:56,501
They know I'm lost.

616
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:59,971
Lost like a baby just born
with nobody to help it.

617
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:08,379
These people running this way
and that way...

618
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:10,315
running in all this open space.

619
00:39:10,315 --> 00:39:15,353
All this light
and choice.

620
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,988
You know, I went to a store
the other day

621
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:19,791
to buy a bar of soap,
and I stood in the aisle

622
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:22,560
for half an hour trying
to figure out which bar to buy.

623
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,495
(giggles)

624
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:26,164
It made my dizzy.

625
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:30,068
See, you can help it
stop spinning...

626
00:39:30,068 --> 00:39:31,736
No, I can't.
...because it's your world,

627
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:33,705
and you've got no reason
to be afraid of it.

628
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:35,206
There's nothing I can do
for you, nothing.

629
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:38,176
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh,
everything you give,
I'll pay you back.

630
00:39:38,176 --> 00:39:40,545
I'll pay you back
and I can set you free!

631
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:43,214
What are you talking about?
Come on.

632
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,683
There are a lot of ways
to spend life behind bars.

633
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:46,884
Now, you thought
about leaving him,

634
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,386
about having a life
of your own.

635
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,721
You can say it out loud!

636
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:52,657
Don't you talk to me
about my father, hmm?

637
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:53,858
He's helpless.

638
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:55,526
You don't understand
the situation.

639
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:57,128
Yeah, do you?

640
00:39:57,128 --> 00:40:00,632
You know what happened
that night?

641
00:40:00,632 --> 00:40:03,868
Lies are every bit
as much a cage as steel bars!

642
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:06,638
Who are you to talk to me
about these things?

643
00:40:06,638 --> 00:40:09,007
You're in jail, Elaine.

644
00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:11,542
You forget that,
you'll never get out!

645
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:22,487
I've lived with you forever.

646
00:40:22,487 --> 00:40:24,722
Sometimes I'm not sure
who you are

647
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:26,858
or what you feel
about things.

648
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:29,460
I let you know
how I feel about you.

649
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,863
Always tried to protect you
from everything that I thought

650
00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:34,032
might cause you pain,
like fathers do.

651
00:40:34,032 --> 00:40:36,367
I don't think we know how
to talk to each other.

652
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:38,670
What's gotten into you lately?
You seem to be even worse than--

653
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,538
There's more to what happened
that night...
Don't start.

654
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:41,873
...than I have been allowed
to know.

655
00:40:41,873 --> 00:40:43,374
Don't run from me!

656
00:40:45,343 --> 00:40:47,545
Who shot you?
Why?

657
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:49,514
You never stop,
do you?
I need to know!

658
00:40:49,514 --> 00:40:51,849
I mean, if there's something
hidden away, I deserve to know!

659
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:54,886
But I told you over and over
and over it was a stranger.

660
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:56,220
Now there's no more to tell.

661
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,189
Then why do you get so angry
when I ask?

662
00:40:58,189 --> 00:40:59,390
Because you're asking me
for something

663
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,525
that I can't give you.

664
00:41:00,525 --> 00:41:02,527
Or won't?

665
00:41:02,527 --> 00:41:05,163
I lost my legs and my wife.
It was senseless.

666
00:41:05,163 --> 00:41:09,534
A lunatic with a gun shot us.
Now, that is all I know.

667
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:11,703
What was his name?
He was a stranger!

668
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:13,037
How the hell
would I know his name?

669
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:14,872
I don't believe
he was a stranger!

670
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:16,207
Please, do this for me.

671
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:17,742
Out of my way.

672
00:41:17,742 --> 00:41:20,345
Just say his name.

673
00:41:20,345 --> 00:41:23,348
Am I being held prisoner
in my own house?

674
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,732
Addison!

675
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:54,005
Are you looking for this?

676
00:42:54,005 --> 00:42:55,506
Who are you?

677
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:57,208
Oh, I'm a friend.

678
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:59,744
I don't have any friends!

679
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:02,480
I didn't say
I was your friend.

680
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,714
I'm a friend of Elaine.

681
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:05,082
Get off my property.

682
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,518
Go on!
Get the hell off of it!

683
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:10,688
You're an alcoholic.

684
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:12,723
Doesn't take a genius
to see it, Addison.

685
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:14,725
How do you know my name?
What do you want?

686
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:18,062
Boy, you bring nothing
but misery, old man.

687
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:19,063
What's the draw?

688
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:20,832
I'm calling a cop.

689
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:25,703
What?

690
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:28,005
A good gig,
old man.

691
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:30,708
Make life hard for everybody
and they just play along.

692
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:32,376
If I could get out
of this chair...

693
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:35,413
You tell me who shot you.

694
00:43:35,413 --> 00:43:37,715
Just what is going on here?

695
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:40,084
You know, somebody put you
in a wheelchair.

696
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:41,385
You must know who it was.

697
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:43,554
That is my business.

698
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:45,756
And I don't talk about it!

699
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:47,558
You know,
if you still had your legs,

700
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:50,394
what do you think the odds are
Elaine would still be hanging
around here,

701
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:53,898
wasting her life taking care
of a piece of work like you?

702
00:43:53,898 --> 00:43:57,235
You hide behind your legs,
Addison.

703
00:43:57,235 --> 00:44:01,305
Why?
Why would I hide?

704
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,740
I'm not guilty of anything.

705
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,876
Guilt?

706
00:44:04,876 --> 00:44:07,145
No.

707
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:09,981
I'm talking about punishment,
Addison.

708
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:11,549
Kill me or get out.

709
00:44:11,549 --> 00:44:13,751
Whatever it is you're gonna do,
just do it!

710
00:44:25,563 --> 00:44:28,699
(Edna)
Addison, I swear,
when I see you...

711
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:30,835
Don't you ever do that
to me again!

712
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:32,336
I swear to you,
Addison Hodges,

713
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,705
one day you're gonna
just push me too far!

714
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:37,508
I'm gonna make you rue the day
that you were born!

715
00:44:41,913 --> 00:44:44,215
I won't be shoved around
by some stupid,

716
00:44:44,215 --> 00:44:46,751
uneducated, no-good punk!
I won't!

717
00:44:46,751 --> 00:44:48,319
What?
What do you mean?

718
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:49,921
I was just threatened
by a maniac

719
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:51,389
in my own backyard!

720
00:44:51,389 --> 00:44:53,224
Who?
Your friend!

721
00:44:53,224 --> 00:44:55,192
That's what he said.
He says he's a friend of yours.

722
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,395
What did he say exactly?
Well, I don't know.

723
00:44:57,395 --> 00:44:59,196
He was looming over me.

724
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,566
I was afraid any second he was
gonna crack my skull open!

725
00:45:01,566 --> 00:45:02,900
Who knows what he said?

726
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:06,537
But he's crazy
and he's going to kill us!

727
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,372
Well, why do you say that?

728
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,675
(stammering)
Well, because
he-he-he-he-he's insane.

729
00:45:10,675 --> 00:45:12,710
'Cause he's--
Because it's random?

730
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,478
No.
No, not this time.

731
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:15,846
Someone picked us again?

732
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:16,847
Are you forgetting
the little matter

733
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:19,584
of you writing
to this bastard?

734
00:45:19,584 --> 00:45:22,720
I'm surprised you didn't
sit out a-- an extra place mat!

735
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,323
You're upset.
Damn right I am.

736
00:45:25,323 --> 00:45:27,225
Man like that
will do anything.

737
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:30,061
There's no conscience,
no-no-no-no logic.

738
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:31,996
(stammering)
It's-It's reptilian!

739
00:45:31,996 --> 00:45:34,031
And we are
at the mercy of it!

740
00:45:36,601 --> 00:45:38,569
Why are you looking at me
like that?

741
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,905
Huh?

742
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:42,707
Why?

743
00:45:42,707 --> 00:45:45,209
(groans)

744
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:07,732
(horn honking)

745
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,102

Mary Ann?

(tires screeching)

748
00:46:51,342 --> 00:46:53,477
I'm sorry!
You okay?

749
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:56,213
Tim, I'm sorry.
That was reckless of me.

750
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:58,582
I'm sorry.
That was a close call.

751
00:46:58,582 --> 00:47:02,086
I wasn't paying attention.
I just-- sorry.

752
00:47:02,086 --> 00:47:04,722
What are you doing
out here?

753
00:47:04,722 --> 00:47:08,559
Um...

754
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:10,895
I'm sorry.

755
00:47:10,895 --> 00:47:12,330
You all right?

756
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:13,397
I'm fine.

757
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:20,938
God, I miss you.
Oh, Tim.

758
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:22,573
I miss you so much.

759
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:24,241

Elaine.
I need to talk
to you.

769
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:45,382
What is it?
You're upset about something.

770
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:48,752
I saw you the other night.
Wednesday night.

771
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:53,724
On Main Street, coming out
of the apartment house.

772
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:57,394
Yes.
Of Charlie Skyler?

773
00:49:57,394 --> 00:50:00,331
You know him.
You were there seeing him.

774
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:02,867
Yes, that's true.

775
00:50:02,867 --> 00:50:06,237
What is this all about?
What are you doing?

776
00:50:06,237 --> 00:50:08,239
Look, I'm very sorry,
Elaine.

777
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:09,874
I didn't know
he was going to get out.

778
00:50:09,874 --> 00:50:11,709
The poor boy spent
most of his life in prison.

779
00:50:11,709 --> 00:50:15,045
A boy?
He's a dangerous man.

780
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:18,115
And you led him to my door.
Elaine, he won't hurt you.

781
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:20,184
How do you know that?
You can't say that.

782
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:22,186
But you have no right
to point a finger.

783
00:50:22,186 --> 00:50:23,921
He's not a piece of garbage.

784
00:50:25,823 --> 00:50:27,391
I pity him.

785
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,662
(engine turns over)

786
00:50:31,662 --> 00:50:33,564
(Timothy)
Come on, kids.
It's cold out here.

787
00:50:37,735 --> 00:50:39,236
Come on.

788
00:50:55,553 --> 00:50:58,055
(door opens and closes)

789
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:09,433
Boy, you miss things
you don't even realize.

790
00:51:11,769 --> 00:51:14,438
Like squeezing a ball of dirt
in your hand.

791
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:15,839
(sniffs)

792
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:23,380
That's peperomia?

793
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:26,750
Used to read books
in the prison library,

794
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,786
and they had one
on horticulture.

795
00:51:28,786 --> 00:51:30,754
Can remember everything
I read.

796
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,089
What do you want?

797
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,260
I told you what I want.

798
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,162
I don't know what this
is all about.

799
00:51:38,162 --> 00:51:41,231
Mary Ann gave me
this letter.

800
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:43,334
Who is she to you?

801
00:51:43,334 --> 00:51:47,404
Mary Ann Rutherford
married Sanford Rutherford

802
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:51,909
right here in this town,
27 years ago.

803
00:51:51,909 --> 00:51:53,677
Her maiden name
was Skyler.

804
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:56,347
Look, I would've found you
someday anyway.

805
00:51:56,347 --> 00:51:58,415
Even before I sent
my first letter,

806
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:03,053
I knew you lived in this town,
and I knew the name Hodges.

807
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:05,255
I knew the old man
was shot and crippled.

808
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:08,292
You torture me!
Just say what you know!

809
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:13,230
Well, the truth is like
everything else.

810
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:16,233
Nobody comes to it
unless they're afraid.
Stop it!

811
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:20,070
Well, what are you
afraid of, Elaine?

812
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:23,207
Are you afraid of me?

813
00:52:23,207 --> 00:52:25,175
The hold your father
has on you?

814
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:30,247
Or are you afraid
of the years to come?

815
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:33,684
Now, that's a fear
that'll rise up in your throat

816
00:52:33,684 --> 00:52:36,520
and choke you every bit
as much as a crazy man.

817
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,689
And when you think
you can't breathe,

818
00:52:38,689 --> 00:52:40,557
you'll do anything.

819
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,729
And even the truth
will seem like a friend.

820
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:54,238
Now, you ask him
who she is.

821
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:05,883
You ask him.

822
00:53:51,195 --> 00:53:53,063
I need to talk to you.

823
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,731
So, talk.

824
00:53:56,934 --> 00:53:58,435
Who's this?

825
00:54:01,271 --> 00:54:03,073
Do you recognize her?

826
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,374
Oh, I don't know.

827
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:05,576
I think she was
a patient of mine.

828
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:07,377
It's such a long time ago,
I don't--

829
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:09,079
What's her name?

830
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,247
What?
Where'd you get this?

831
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:12,216
I want to know everything
about this woman.

832
00:54:12,216 --> 00:54:14,284
Now, how would I know
everything about her?

833
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:16,587
She was just
a patient of mine.

834
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:18,422
I don't know, maybe...

835
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:20,424
well, I think she lived
around here somewhere.

836
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:23,727
Matter of fact,
I think she died
rather suddenly.

837
00:54:23,727 --> 00:54:25,295
How?

838
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:26,964
Oh, hemorrhage
or something.

839
00:54:26,964 --> 00:54:29,600
"Or something"?

840
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:32,636
You watch your attitude,
young lady.

841
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:37,741
I've had just
about enough of this.

842
00:54:48,252 --> 00:54:49,419
(phone ringing)

843
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:51,255
Hold on, whoever you are!

844
00:54:51,255 --> 00:54:53,557
I'm here! I'm here!
Hello?

845
00:54:53,557 --> 00:54:55,425
(Elaine)
<i> Tim?</i>

846
00:54:55,425 --> 00:54:57,427
Ah, just a minute.
Kids, okay, that's enough.

847
00:54:57,427 --> 00:54:58,896
Come on, Daddy's
on the phone now, all right?

848
00:54:58,896 --> 00:55:00,264
<i> Just hang on.</i>

849
00:55:00,264 --> 00:55:01,265
<i> Okay, okay, that's it.</i>

850
00:55:01,265 --> 00:55:03,800
Come on, go, go!

851
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,403
(sighs)

852
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:08,605
This is not a good idea
to call here.

853
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:12,242
You won't look at me.
Now you don't wanna talk to me?

854
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:18,182
What have we done?

855
00:55:18,182 --> 00:55:21,752
<i> Uh, I think that my situation</i>
<i> is pretty obvious.</i>

856
00:55:21,752 --> 00:55:23,921
Uh, really?

857
00:55:23,921 --> 00:55:27,791
Not too much is obvious
to me these days.

858
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:30,594
<i> Are you all right?</i>

859
00:55:30,594 --> 00:55:32,529
No.

860
00:55:32,529 --> 00:55:34,798
I took you to my bed.
<i> Elaine...</i>

861
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:36,400
That meant something.

862
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,602
Okay.
I'm gonna hang up.

863
00:55:38,602 --> 00:55:39,970
<i> Wait.</i>
Good night, Daddy!

864
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:42,573
You have a beautiful family.

865
00:55:42,573 --> 00:55:44,741
I know you'd never want
to see them hurting.

866
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:49,680
I need you to do something
for me.

867
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,248
Do you understand?

868
00:55:51,248 --> 00:55:52,616
(door closes)

869
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,796
This file...

870
00:56:05,796 --> 00:56:08,131
this file was never released
to the press.

871
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:10,534
The old chief and your father,
they were good friends.

872
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:13,437
Maybe he was a patient.
Both.

873
00:56:13,437 --> 00:56:16,306
I-I don't know why you're
doing this to yourself.

874
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:19,243
Yeah, well, you're kind
to worry about me.

875
00:56:20,344 --> 00:56:22,579
I do worry about you.

876
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,860
There are things in there
you shouldn't see.

877
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,295
Not alone.

878
00:56:44,935 --> 00:56:46,403
Oh, my mother!

879
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,913
Who would d-do some--

880
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:58,715
(stammering)

881
00:56:58,715 --> 00:57:02,119
Just tell me
what it says.

882
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:04,187
What does it say?

883
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:05,922
The file doesn't contain
a motive.

884
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,691
And it doesn't
identify the assailant

885
00:57:07,691 --> 00:57:09,559
except to say
that it was a woman.

886
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:10,594
A woman?

887
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:16,266
(gun clicks and gunshot)

888
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,934
How can that be?

889
00:57:20,971 --> 00:57:22,806
It was a woman?

890
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:29,613
(Elaine groaning and grunting)

891
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:36,453
(Elaine retching)

892
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:46,797
Honey, you all right?

893
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:50,734
Yeah, I'm all right.
I'm just-- I'm tired.

894
00:57:50,734 --> 00:57:52,903
I just gotta get dressed.

895
00:57:56,273 --> 00:57:57,474
You're pregnant.

896
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,409
What?

897
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:01,044
Don't be ridiculous.

898
00:58:01,044 --> 00:58:03,814
You don't wanna lie
about a thing like that.

899
00:58:06,216 --> 00:58:08,051
I think you'd be
a fine mother.

900
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:10,454
(Elaine sobbing)
Oh, honey.

901
00:58:10,454 --> 00:58:12,689
Come-- oh, I--

902
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:15,726
Oh, it's o-- oh.

903
00:58:15,726 --> 00:58:17,928
Look, you're not alone.
You remember that.

904
00:58:17,928 --> 00:58:20,530
I'm not so sure
about that, Edna.

905
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:23,400
This is...
This is so stupid.

906
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,435
It's a gift.

907
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:28,138
It's something
you can call your own.

908
00:58:28,138 --> 00:58:30,374
Does he know?
My father?

909
00:58:30,374 --> 00:58:33,043
Oh, no, goodness.
Your man?

910
00:58:33,043 --> 00:58:36,046
No.

911
00:58:36,046 --> 00:58:39,583
I haven't found the right moment
to tell him.

912
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:54,264
She was my mother.

913
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:56,299
She was insane.

914
00:58:56,299 --> 00:58:58,402
Now, that's too easy.

915
00:58:58,402 --> 00:59:00,404
She and your father
were lovers.

916
00:59:00,404 --> 00:59:02,472
I don't believe you.

917
00:59:02,472 --> 00:59:04,374
Oh, you think you're special,
you should be spared?

918
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:07,244
From lies.
Well, no more lies, Elaine.

919
00:59:07,244 --> 00:59:09,146
I was ten
when it happened.

920
00:59:09,146 --> 00:59:12,082
We lived in a little house
maybe 15 miles or so from here.

921
00:59:12,082 --> 00:59:13,950
We were poor
and she got sick.

922
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:17,387
We came to your dad
and he made her well.

923
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:20,056
And she was pretty.
He liked that.

924
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:23,927
He was rich, a doctor,
and he used her.
I don't need to hear this.

925
00:59:23,927 --> 00:59:27,564
She knew he lied,
but she grew to love him.

926
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:30,434
To need him, yearn for him.
Then she was a fool.

927
00:59:30,434 --> 00:59:33,437
Yeah, of course she was!
Your daddy knew that.

928
00:59:33,437 --> 00:59:34,905
Your daddy likes being
with a fool

929
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:36,807
so he can get
what he wants!

930
00:59:36,807 --> 00:59:39,042
You know that key
I gave you?

931
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:41,244
She wore it on a chain
that hung around her neck.

932
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:43,313
It opens up
that little house in back

933
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:45,248
where he'd practice medicine.

934
00:59:55,292 --> 00:59:58,428
What do you think
of the truth, Elaine?

935
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:01,431
I can't say it's a blessing.
It's ruined my life.

936
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,600
And again,
the lies ruined yours.

937
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,570
I gotta get out of here.
He's cruel!

938
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:08,605
He takes from people
and he doesn't give back!

939
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:10,807
You want me to hate my father
for something that's over!

940
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:12,609
It's done!
You look at us.

941
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:14,778
Look at us
and tell me it's done!

942
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:17,647
It isn't done!

943
01:00:17,647 --> 01:00:20,116
You ache
for something better.

944
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:23,119
You said so yourself.
It's time.

945
01:00:24,387 --> 01:00:26,389
(horn honking)

946
01:00:42,038 --> 01:00:46,042
♪♪

947
01:01:02,592 --> 01:01:04,027
(Elaine)
Hey!

948
01:01:11,468 --> 01:01:13,770
You bastard!

949
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:14,804
(grunts)

950
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:16,439
Hey, what's the matter
with you?

951
01:01:16,439 --> 01:01:18,074
Are you crazy?
You're evil!

952
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:20,810
Save that crap
for your holy rollers!
Now, get out of my way.

953
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:24,314
You'll stay where are
if I have to knock you down!

954
01:01:24,314 --> 01:01:26,650
You knew all along!

955
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:28,251
What?
What'd I know?

956
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:30,120
What the hell
do you want from me?

957
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,955
I want your confession!

958
01:01:35,292 --> 01:01:37,527
How can you talk like this
to your father?

959
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:38,762
What gives you the right?

960
01:01:38,762 --> 01:01:41,765
The right?
The right?

961
01:01:41,765 --> 01:01:43,700
I gave my life over to you!

962
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,536
Dressed you! Bathed you!
Listened to you!

963
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,071
And now I wanna hear
the truth!

964
01:01:48,071 --> 01:01:50,807
And I want to hear all of it!
All of it, now!

965
01:01:50,807 --> 01:01:52,442
Say it!
Okay, okay!

966
01:01:52,442 --> 01:01:54,210
You win!

967
01:02:01,451 --> 01:02:04,120
It was no stranger.

968
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:07,457
It was someone I knew.
A woman.

969
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:08,959
She was on my doorstep,

970
01:02:08,959 --> 01:02:11,561
begging for help,
full of disease!

971
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,530
It's what happens
when you live like a pig.

972
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:16,766
I shot her full
of antibiotics,

973
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:19,035
and unfortunately, she lived.

974
01:02:19,035 --> 01:02:22,772
A medical service for which
you would receive payment?

975
01:02:22,772 --> 01:02:25,075
Uh-huh, yeah,
you could say that,
I guess, yes.

976
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:26,209
You raped her!

977
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:28,712
Didn't have to.
She loved me.

978
01:02:28,712 --> 01:02:30,280
Yeah.

979
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,948
She wanted me
to leave your mother!

980
01:02:31,948 --> 01:02:33,450
You imagine that?
Huh?

981
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:35,118
I don't know what the hell
she was thinking,

982
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:37,454
but that's what she wanted.
Shut up!

983
01:02:37,454 --> 01:02:40,223
It would've been kinder
to have pinned her down
and choked her!

984
01:02:40,223 --> 01:02:41,791
Heh, in retrospect,

985
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:44,661
that would not have been
such a bad idea.

986
01:02:44,661 --> 01:02:46,229
Oh...

987
01:02:46,229 --> 01:02:48,765
Mea culpa.
Mea culpa.

988
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:51,101
(groans)

989
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:53,269
Eh, you're not
so happy now, are you?

990
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:55,639
Now that you know.
Oh...

991
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:59,109
(shivering)

992
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:03,947
Get hold of yourself.

993
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:06,416
Life goes on,
trust me.

994
01:03:06,416 --> 01:03:09,452
And nothing
has to change.

995
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:10,720
Hmm?

996
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:15,458
No father.

997
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,260
It's going to change.

998
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:21,598
I'm pregnant.

999
01:03:23,266 --> 01:03:24,868
I'm gonna have a baby.

1000
01:03:25,902 --> 01:03:26,903
(sniffles)

1001
01:03:30,607 --> 01:03:31,908
Baby?

1002
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:35,145
(chuckling)
You... are going

1003
01:03:35,145 --> 01:03:36,780
to have a baby?

1004
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:40,917
(laughing)

1005
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:44,120
Now, who the hell
would want to have a--

1006
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,789
Hey... Elaine?

1007
01:03:47,123 --> 01:03:50,960
Uh... it's a little
out of my area of expertise,

1008
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,798
but, uh... it's no big deal
to terminate a pregnancy.

1009
01:03:54,798 --> 01:03:56,599
Particularly
one that's early on.

1010
01:03:56,599 --> 01:03:59,903
You've probably got a few weeks
left in your first trimester.

1011
01:03:59,903 --> 01:04:01,771
I'll fire up
the old autoclave,

1012
01:04:01,771 --> 01:04:04,140
do it myself, and no one
would be the wiser.

1013
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:05,375
What do you say?

1014
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:07,644
(sobbing)

1015
01:04:07,644 --> 01:04:08,645
Think it over!

1016
01:04:08,645 --> 01:04:10,647
Elaine?

1017
01:04:12,282 --> 01:04:13,283
Dang.

1018
01:04:23,827 --> 01:04:26,129
(slow breathing)

1019
01:04:28,665 --> 01:04:30,133
(slams door)

1020
01:04:31,768 --> 01:04:33,470
(Elaine)
I'm late.

1021
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:35,105
I have to go to work.

1022
01:04:36,406 --> 01:04:38,108
So go.

1023
01:04:38,108 --> 01:04:39,142
(clears throat)

1024
01:04:41,077 --> 01:04:43,480
There's someone on their way
over to meet you.

1025
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,148
Hector Roose.

1026
01:04:46,316 --> 01:04:48,051
Ohh.

1027
01:04:48,051 --> 01:04:49,919
Andy give up
the ghost?

1028
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:52,155
Another paid companion?

1029
01:04:52,155 --> 01:04:53,656
Patient.

1030
01:04:53,656 --> 01:04:57,494
He remembers you
as a fine doctor.

1031
01:04:57,494 --> 01:05:01,097
He wants you to diagnose
his heart palpitations.

1032
01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:02,632
No kidding.

1033
01:05:02,632 --> 01:05:05,635
Huh.

1034
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:08,738
I'm back in business.

1035
01:05:18,648 --> 01:05:20,316
(Addison)
Edna!

1036
01:05:20,316 --> 01:05:22,452
Edna,
come in here!

1037
01:05:22,452 --> 01:05:23,720
(Edna)
I'm coming.

1038
01:05:25,288 --> 01:05:26,456
Edna!

1039
01:05:26,456 --> 01:05:27,957
(Edna)
Yeees?

1040
01:05:27,957 --> 01:05:29,125
Well, why didn't
you answer me?

1041
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:30,126
I want my vest.

1042
01:05:30,126 --> 01:05:31,594
Why do you need
your vest?

1043
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:32,762
(Addison)
Never mind
why I want it.

1044
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:33,963
I want my vest!

1045
01:05:33,963 --> 01:05:35,298
You going somewhere?

1046
01:05:35,298 --> 01:05:36,299
None of
your business.

1047
01:05:36,299 --> 01:05:38,134
Where are you going?
I just want my vest.

1048
01:05:38,134 --> 01:05:39,302
Got a date?

1049
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:46,109
(key jingling)

1050
01:05:52,115 --> 01:05:53,750
(Edna)
If you get stuck
out there,

1051
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:55,552
I'm not gonna
come get you.

1052
01:05:55,552 --> 01:05:57,754
So who asked you to?

1053
01:05:57,754 --> 01:06:00,089
Anybody that'd let you
practice medicine on 'em

1054
01:06:00,089 --> 01:06:02,492
deserves what they get.

1055
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:25,048
(door unlatches)

1056
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:45,668
(door creaking)

1057
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:47,070
(door latches)

1058
01:06:48,471 --> 01:06:49,606
(grunts softly)

1059
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:58,081

Edna told us

1260
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:47,516
headed out to the guest house
before 8:30.

She had breakfast all ready,
but he didn't want it.

Mr. Roose would be coming?
