1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,554
- Will you marry me?
- I'll try to decide quicker.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,477
I hate you.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,558
<i>Tonight on Columbo...</i>

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,989
This is the man she said
she was going to marry.

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,269
He is?

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,994
<i>- Who are you?
- I'm a detective.</i>

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,076
- Like some?
- Any time.

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,237
There can't be any connection
between her deciding to marry

9
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,032
and her being dead, could there?

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,674
Good luck in Palm Springs.

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,598
You didn't kill her either, did you?
Well, did you?!

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,755
I know who did it.

13
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,755
We got it!

14
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,238
<i>Look at this.
Limousines, giggling women...</i>

15
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,399
Ugh! My God. All that excitement
over nothing but a book.

16
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,637
- Nobody but a writer.
- Hey, my car's down the next alley.

17
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,955
After everything I've heard about her,

18
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,719
I wanna see
what she looks like in the flesh.

19
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,793
Why she's such a big deal to you.

20
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,150
Romance novels!

21
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,228
Helen, would you wait a minute?

22
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,152
Isn't it wonderful
how photographers can touch people up?

23
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,636
I mean, what is she really? 49? 50?

24
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,194
55?

25
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,750
So, she really is pretty.
Wouldn't you know?

26
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,352
- Here. I've got to get back to the office.
- Hey... No, no, no.

27
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,792
Why don't you hang on to the ring? Might
make you feel more comfortable in hotels.

28
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,710
- Don't you dare make fun of me!
- Helen, it was beautiful. Really.

29
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,752
I never had my taxes done so nicely.

30
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,712
A part-time computer shouldn't complain,
right? Just peddle the insurance.

31
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,673
Not for long. As soon as I become
head of my own studio,

32
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,870
I'll make you VP of Business Affairs.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,231
- Oh, yeah, sure you will.
- You wanna bet?

34
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,555
Do you wanna bet how soon?

35
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,399
I don't bet
with people who owe me money.

36
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,478
Look, good luck in Palm Springs.

37
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,436
Oh, damn you.

38
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,832
Here you go, sir.
I'll take those for you.

39
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,797
- I hope you enjoy the book.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

40
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,717
Oh! Look out!

41
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,714
Wayne! Finally!

42
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,914
I saw your car in the alley, but no one
could tell me when I'd actually see you.

43
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,235
Welcome home, kid.

44
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,315
<i>I did hope you'd change
your mind and meet me at the airport.</i>

45
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,318
<i>With all those agents
and PR people? No, thanks.</i>

46
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,591
Even if I hadn't been tied up
with my tax guy all morning.

47
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,109
Anyway, I thought Mavis would be there.

48
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,073
Wayne, darling, you don't have to explain.

49
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,794
If you'll just tell me
where you were Monday night.

50
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,038
I called twice from Denver, once
after supper and just before I went to bed.

51
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,071
Monday? I got a call from my agent

52
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,158
and had to rush into town
to read for a part in a movie.

53
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,795
Wayne, that's wonderful! Oh, but when
would you be going to work?

54
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,469
Because my book tour is over,
except for a couple of appearances in LA.

55
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,114
- But if you're gonna...
- I haven't got the part yet.

56
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,199
Oh, that's good. Then on Sunday
let's fly to the islands. To Maui.

57
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,392
Just the two of us. No one
will even know or care who we are.

58
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,988
<i>Terrific.
No, wait, not Sunday.</i>

59
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,078
If I reach the finals,
I could still be in Palm Springs.

60
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,918
- Palm Springs?
- Didn't I tell you?

61
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,316
I'm in a celebrity tennis tournament.
Isn't that great?

62
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,318
- Oh, no, you can't!
- It's a terrific opportunity.

63
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,954
Rocca, the producer of that picture,
will be there.

64
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,674
You don't have to act
with everything else you can do.

65
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,360
Honey, it leads to better things.

66
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,800
Don't you realise
I've been gone six weeks?

67
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,071
Yes, but you're home now. Come on.

68
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,397
You're worn out
and you need a massage.

69
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,750
I got the pool all heated up for you.

70
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,510
- You can't just go off every time some...
- Look. What do you think?

71
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,556
The petunias.

72
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,753
I borrowed an extra gardener from
Mrs Shannon to help get 'em in on time.

73
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:41,273
That is the colour you wanted, isn't it?
And I put the bluebonnets in myself.

74
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,234
Matches the dress you were wearing
when I first saw you.

75
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,476
They're the most beautiful petunias
I've ever seen.

76
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,434
Mrs Shannon still seems to think
I'm just your house-sitter.

77
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,348
I'm not surprised -
the poor dear's as deaf as a post.

78
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,596
Relax your shoulders.

79
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,597
Wayne, what's really wrong?
What haven't you told me yet?

80
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,475
- Why run off the minute I come home?
- I'm not. I'll be back Tuesday at the latest.

81
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,717
Don't lie to me. I told you
I'd never tie a rope around you,

82
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,229
but in the last six weeks
did you meet someone?

83
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,397
For God's sakes, it wasn't six weeks,
it was six years!

84
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,274
There wasn't a single day I didn't wish
you'd gone with me. You could've.

85
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,960
As what? Your bodyguard?

86
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,072
Theresa... will you marry me?

87
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,673
Oh, please. You promised you wouldn't
say it again until the end of summer.

88
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,031
- Not until I've thought it out.
- So I'm a liar. I can't help it.

89
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,711
I just think of the time we're wasting. We
could be diving for treasure in the Aegean.

90
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,071
- Or making a film of your latest book...
- Please, stop, stop!

91
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,952
There are so many differences. Not just
age, but so many things to consider.

92
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,390
No, I won't stop.
And to hell with what anyone else says.

93
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,557
The only thing I can't stand
is this living with you

94
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,717
and living without you at the same time.

95
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,313
I'll try to decide quicker, Wayne.

96
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,192
I will.

97
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,359
Hello?

98
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,040
Hey, I told you never to call me...

99
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,268
Yes, of course I'll be there.
I'm just leaving.

100
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,392
Well, did you ask her?
My husband is so excited

101
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,991
about the possibility of getting the rights
to one of her books, like you suggested.

102
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,148
First things first. That was just talk.
Right now I've got other things in mind.

103
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,316
So have I. Only hurry up, will you?

104
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,908
<i>- Wayne?
- That's all right. No problem.</i>

105
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,197
Wayne?

106
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,552
- Who was it?
- Just a wrong number.

107
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,592
Oh, couldn't you stay
just another half-hour?

108
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,590
I don't have to get dressed until...

109
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,396
Honey, in Tahiti
we would never have to get dressed.

110
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,315
Mm... I gotta run.

111
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,237
I'll call you.

112
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,076
Ms Goren,
why haven't you ever been married?

113
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,919
<i>Yeah,
that's a good question.</i>

114
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,430
I just... I was always too busy, I guess.

115
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,836
Um... Well, my work really does interfere.

116
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,394
You think it's easy to write 24 books,

117
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,909
to have three bestsellers
at the same time?

118
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,713
<i>Do you know how long it takes
just to read 24 books?</i>

119
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,037
Not to mention all those trips
back and forth to the bank.

120
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,511
<i>- Sir, have you read all of her books?
- My hair stylist has.</i>

121
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,949
You, the lady with the beads?

122
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:14,757
Ms Goren, I've noticed that your heroines
could be lots of us - or I hope so.

123
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,509
But where do you find models
for these terrific guys

124
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,428
who would rather look at you
instead of themselves?

125
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,270
Well, my mother used to drag us
to old Errol Flynn movies,

126
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,393
<i>and I think I must've read lvanhoe
50 times.</i>

127
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:36,548
You mean you just made up all those
faithful, brave, unselfish heroes?

128
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,355
- I mean, no models at all?
- That's what a romance novel is, isn't it?

129
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,517
What you wish life were like,
instead of the way it really is.

130
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,710
Wait! Wait!

131
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,674
Ms Goren, I don't believe you,
because I was in that bookstore today,

132
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,998
and right after you signed this,
I saw you talking to this gorgeous hunk.

133
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,678
<i>Whoo!</i>

134
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,794
And I noticed he had the longest lashes
over those beautiful blue eyes.

135
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,674
Well, right here on page 87 it says:

136
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,112
"He had long lashes and tangled hair
the colour of chestnuts in autumn."

137
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,268
"Beneath them, the eyes of her love,
the blue of the sky."

138
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,152
<i>Ahh...</i>

139
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,831
<i>Was that the same man I saw you with
in the Enquirer picture last month?</i>

140
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,712
<i>Tell us, Theresa!</i>

141
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,310
Oh, all right. Yes.
He's a friend of mine.

142
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,115
But what about those eyelashes?
Hey, what's going on here?

143
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,550
- They're for Ms Goren, sir.
- Sure they are. Who put you up to this?

144
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,513
<i>- Oh, that's a secret.
- Speak of the devil, maybe?</i>

145
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,757
<i>- Come on, tell us!
- He must be madly in love with you.</i>

146
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,670
<i>Oh, why shouldn't I tell you? He just says
that he misses me already, that's all.</i>

147
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,631
<i>Aww...</i>

148
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,877
<i>He always says the right thing,
does the right thing.</i>

149
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,357
<i>"He, he, he..." Who is "he"?</i>

150
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,755
<i>Who is it? Who is it?</i>

151
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,836
<i>His name is Wayne. Wayne Jennings.</i>

152
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,997
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

153
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:14,310
<i>It's just me I'm laughing at, because...
 why shouldn't I make up my mind?</i>

154
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,829
<i>Why shouldn't everybody know?</i>

155
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,032
<i>It's Wayne Jennings I love, and...</i>

156
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,072
<i>I've just decided I'm going
to marry him as soon as I can.</i>

157
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,715
<i>Yes, Jess?</i>

158
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:31,356
<i>Take your butt of the desk
and get me Charlie Fisher.</i>

159
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,913
<i>- Hello?
- Charlie?</i>

160
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,600
<i>- Yeah, Jess...
- You were meant to be watching him.</i>

161
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,599
<i>- Of course I was watching...
- What's going on? What's he been up to?</i>

162
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,474
Look, I've barely had a chance
to get my little book on the guy started...

163
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,797
<i>- It's not a full rundown.
- I need something now that I can use.</i>

164
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,990
I'm sure I'll have more on him later.

165
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,715
<i>You'd better. Don't mess with the details.
 Just get me what I need.</i>

166
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:10,311
<i>- Get me what I need!
- You're the boss. I'll get it over to you.</i>

167
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,995
Boy!

168
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,034
<i>- Hello?
- Hello, Wayne.</i>

169
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:36,154
Hi, it's you. I tried to call you earlier.
I guess you were asleep.

170
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,075
Just a minute.
Let me get this phone untangled.

171
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,076
That's better.

172
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:49,115
I was a little late getting down here.
Hit a rock, had some tyre trouble.

173
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:54,394
And I missed your broadcast. It wasn't
on here anyway because of the tennis.

174
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,795
Then I got hung up
with some guys at the club.

175
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,311
I didn't hear what you said about marrying
me till 2am, from a bartender of all people!

176
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,231
Everybody started buying champagne...
Honey, I love you. I love you so much.

177
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,669
<i>- Shut up, you bastard!
- What?</i>

178
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,360
I'll never marry you! I'm not a fool!

179
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,235
Have you been drinking? Have you been
talking to your meddling sister again?

180
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,272
<i>- No!
- I don't believe you.</i>

181
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,029
Get some sleep. I'm coming home
tomorrow night and we'll talk about it.

182
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,958
<i>No, don't.
I'm flying to Seattle tomorrow.</i>

183
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,469
I despise you! You're a joke!

184
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,398
<i>I hate you! I hate you!</i>

185
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,951
<i>Hello. This is Helen speaking.</i>

186
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,517
<i>I'm not in right now, but if you leave your
name, number and when to reach you,</i>

187
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,393
<i>I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
 Thanks for calling.</i>

188
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,911
<i>Helen, it's me, Wayne.
I just stopped in town for some gas.</i>

189
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,510
<i>I hope you can hear me -
this crazy traffic on the freeway.</i>

190
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,996
<i>Listen, my plans are changed.
 I'm on my way back to Theresa's place.</i>

191
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,749
<i>I'll call you when I
get a chance, OK?</i>

192
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:36,279
What, you think I have time for breakfast?
My watch says 7:15. Is that right?

193
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,520
Great. Thanks, Mavis. Well, I'll see you out
at the house in about an hour and a half.

194
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,599
Oh, Mavis?
Just don't tell Theresa I'm coming.

195
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,954
- Like some?
- Any time.

196
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,719
Oh, what a nice way to start the day.

197
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,795
Columbo. Columbo.

198
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:29,516
Schultz. Don't know why
they bothered you. It's pretty routine.

199
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,792
Well, the captain sent me out.
He was a personal friend of Ms Goren's.

200
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,918
You better hold it, boys.
He probably wants a look.

201
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,396
- You moved the body?
- Well, nobody told me you were coming.

202
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,873
Wonderful.

203
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,072
She was found in the study
near her open safe.

204
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,510
No rigor mortis yet,
but cooling probably happened at dawn.

205
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,713
She was shot once in the back and once
in the head, probably a small calibre.

206
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,718
Both bullets still inside.
She was shot at close range.

207
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,308
There, you can see
the skull fragmentation.

208
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,877
- You got a picture of her position?
- Yeah, someplace.

209
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,398
- Any other marks on her body?
- I didn't see any.

210
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,351
No other marks.

211
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,670
- Those men's socks?
- No, Lieutenant, they're ladies'.

212
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,429
- They're called knee socks.
- Knee socks.

213
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,393
- Here's the picture.
- Oh, thank you very much.

214
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,239
- Uh, would you do me a favour, please?
- Sure.

215
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,591
Would you get rid of these shells?
Thank you very much.

216
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,678
OK, fellas, you can take it way.

217
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,156
Shoes, a robe, panties, bra...

218
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,036
and knee socks.

219
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,438
Very good. Would you care
to step inside now and look at the safe?

220
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,597
- I would. Thank you very much.
- Follow me.

221
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:50,754
This is it. Real antique.
Not much security, but plenty fireproof.

222
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,553
Ms Goren used it mostly
to keep her manuscripts in.

223
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,752
She also kept some jewellery in here -
about $100,000 worth,

224
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,996
according to her secretary,
and it is gone.

225
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,473
Her secretary is here?

226
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,512
Right. She found the body
when she came just before eight.

227
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:09,556
I see. Did she notice anything else
missing, or just the jewellery?

228
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,194
- Well, only the gun so far.
- The gun?

229
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,790
Ms Goren's. Little pistol
she kept in the drawer here.

230
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,354
- How do you know that?
- Her secretary told us.

231
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,234
- We found it open, no gun.
- Oh. Makes sense.

232
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,716
What about this drawer?
Was this also open a little bit?

233
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,799
Er, yeah. You see, the way I see it,

234
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,639
she got up early
and she was getting dressed.

235
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,115
She started to turn on the TV.

236
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,550
Now, when we got here it was still on,
but there was no sound.

237
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:42,514
I think maybe she heard something,
she got a little frightened,

238
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,553
she got the gun
and she started to look around the house.

239
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:51,834
She went downstairs, into the study,
found someone going through the safe.

240
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,316
Any guy with a little experience
can open an old-timer like that.

241
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,317
Any guy? What guy?

242
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,069
The thief. He obviously
got the gun away from her and, er...

243
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,398
- What the hell are you looking at?
- Oh, it's nothing. Panties.

244
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,149
Turns out my wife
wears the same brand as Ms Goren.

245
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:15,116
So it was a robbery that went bad. OK...
What about prints on the safe?

246
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,036
Just Ms Goren's, and they're smeared.
Same on the dial.

247
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,516
Whoever opened the safe last
must've been wearing gloves.

248
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,310
Like I told you, professional thief.

249
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,352
The secretary's name is Mavis.
But she's still a little upset.

250
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,277
Come on.

251
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,757
You know, Schultz, I gotta say
you have this thing very well organised.

252
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,677
Thank you.

253
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,149
- Oh, look at that.
- What?

254
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,430
Now, that's interesting.

255
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,155
It's where he got in, that's all.
There's no prints there either.

256
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,512
No, no, I mean that a professional
could open the safe that cleanly

257
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,359
and have to break glass
to open a French door.

258
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,439
It's the quickest way. Maybe he forced her
to open the safe. What's the difference?

259
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,836
But my nephew could open this
with a boy-scout knife.

260
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:19,193
Will you please come on outside?
I got some guys looking for footprints.

261
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,556
Excuse me, ma'am.
I know how badly you must feel.

262
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,478
I wanna say I know
what a fine woman Ms Goren was.

263
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,478
My wife read every one of her books.

264
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,273
- How long were you with her?
- Many years.

265
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,915
Well, maybe you can help me.
You must've known her habits.

266
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:00,194
I noticed she was wearing white socks -
I thought they were men's socks.

267
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,513
They were knee socks.
They were her dressy ones.

268
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,029
I see. Well, they caught me off-guard.

269
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,675
I didn't expect that, and I was wondering,
did she often wear?

270
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,839
No. No, of course not.
They're more comfortable with slacks.

271
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,713
Ah, with slacks. Now I understand.

272
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,958
One more thing. Is there an ashtray?
I'd like to get rid of these eggshells.

273
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,674
<i>- Yes, of course.
- Oh, my God!</i>

274
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,189
Um... just a minute.

275
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,196
Wayne!

276
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,352
<i>I'm so sorry!
Honey, I'm so sorry!</i>

277
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,596
I'm so sorry.

278
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,075
I just... feel awful for you.
This must be...

279
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,671
It's OK, Mavis. Shh...
I'm all right. Really.

280
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,554
Honey, you just take it easy.
I'll be just fine.

281
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,831
<i>Ms Thompson,
I brought your coffee.</i>

282
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,873
You go ahead. I'll be all right.

283
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,152
I guess you're Ms Goren's
tennis instructor?

284
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,111
- Who are you?
- Oh, no.

285
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:19,279
Didn't you see Ms Goren
on television last night? This is Wayne.

286
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,995
Wayne Jennings.
The man she said she was going to marry.

287
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,111
He is?

288
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,432
Oh...

289
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,951
No, there isn't gonna be a wedding.
Look, honey, can I call you back?

290
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:03,039
I don't want to explain!
I just got in. Something's happened.

291
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,118
<i>If I tell you what,
you'll just print it wrong, damn you.</i>

292
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,310
And I don't know yet myself!

293
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,072
Call back later.

294
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,078
Oh, Captain, I'm sorry.
I didn't know it was you.

295
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,033
Yes, I got your dreadful message.

296
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:25,873
No, no, I do thank you and... I know
you'll do everything you can to help.

297
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,314
Yes. I'm on my way now.

298
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,795
The garage is bringing your car up.

299
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:38,519
Micki, just say I didn't get in yet, you
don't know anything... and stop bawling.

300
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,431
All right.

301
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,718
Jess McCurdy Agency?

302
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,479
Oh, are you finding lots of fingerprints?

303
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,434
Oh... How do you do, sir?
Fingerprints? No, sir, nothing.

304
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,870
But if a guy came in here,
a professional thief,

305
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,309
and had to pass
all these beautiful things,

306
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,955
isn't it strange that he wouldn't
pick one up and put it in his pocket?

307
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,719
- Yeah, it is strange.
- It is strange, isn't it, sir?

308
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:25,118
Oh, Mr Jennings, I hope you'll forgive me
for assuming you were a tennis instructor.

309
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,754
- I just didn't know.
- That's quite all right.

310
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,996
What are you? A professional player?

311
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,590
There are other things in life
besides tennis! It's only a game.

312
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,076
Actually, I was in Palm Springs
playing a celebrity tournament.

313
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,990
Ah... Oh, celebrity tournament?
I see. I understand, sir.

314
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:48,070
Uh, I was wondering, is there an ashtray?
I'd like to get rid of these eggshells.

315
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,992
There's an ashtray right on the table.

316
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,793
- What's the matter, sir?
- It's gone.

317
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,878
God...

318
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,039
You may be right about that guy.
The killer?

319
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:11,278
There was a green Buddha with gold filigree
- It sat right here. You can't miss it.

320
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,231
- Green?
- Yes, jade.

321
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,158
It was a gift from one of Theresa's fans,
some maharani.

322
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:20,478
- Well, I don't know anything about jade.
- Neither do I, but a thief might.

323
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,831
And I do know it was insured for $25,000.

324
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,235
$25,000?!

325
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,239
- You hear that? You better start looking.
- I'll check the other rooms.

326
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,272
Mr Jennings, I can see
that you can be a big help here,

327
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,710
and we do have to know
anything that might be missing.

328
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:42,073
Now, I noticed there's a room upstairs
with all men's clothing in it...

329
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,395
That's my room.

330
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:48,069
- Oh, you live here?
- Yes. Does that shock you?

331
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,191
No, sir. No.

332
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,914
Could we look around?

333
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,679
If you'd like to snoop, please.

334
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,996
Be my guest.

335
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,669
Boy. She sure fixed this up nice for you.

336
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,917
Not an easy job,
considering all the junk I dragged in.

337
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,951
You mean...

338
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,231
you caught this thing?

339
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,750
Cabo San Lucas.
Over 100 pounds on a ten-pound test line.

340
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,714
You don't say. Wow...

341
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,231
And that's you on a mountain, too?

342
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,397
The one on the left's my Sherpa.
I'm the one on top.

343
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,795
- And sky-diving? That's you?
- Yes.

344
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,593
And on the yacht. I was crewing
a race in New Zealand.

345
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,438
Wow.

346
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:47,154
I mean, for a man as young as you
to have managed to do all these things

347
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,716
and still find time to...
well, earn a living and all...

348
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,876
I thought you just wanted to know
if anything was missing in here.

349
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,800
- Who is this lady?
- It's Jess McCurdy.

350
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:34,435
- McCurdy? Oh, that's her agent.
- Her sister.

351
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,757
- Oh, Jess, I am so terribly sorry...
- Cut the crap.

352
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,316
I've been told what happened.
Why aren't you in Palm Springs?

353
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,433
I got a call late last night, someone
telling me what Theresa'd said on TV,

354
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,677
and I just wanted to come back here
and surprise her.

355
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:54,351
- Surprise her?
- To be with her. To hell with tennis.

356
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,438
Jess, I was the happiest guy in the world.

357
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,318
Ask Mavis - I called her at 7:15
this morning on my way through LA.

358
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:07,275
I told her not to tell Theresa.
I just wanted it to be a surprise.

359
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:11,632
God, if only I hadn't stopped in town for
breakfast or to pick up all these flowers.

360
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,035
Look. See for yourself.

361
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:20,876
I stopped at a nursery.
I bought every flower in the place.

362
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,438
Wayne, didn't you know that Theresa was
going to Seattle for another book party?

363
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:31,475
No. Not until I talked to Mavis
this morning on the phone.

364
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:37,038
She said Theresa was going up this afternoon,
so I figured I'd fly up with her.

365
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,269
I even had this all ready.

366
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,912
It was my grandmother's wedding ring.

367
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:08,112
You know, I got sort of a classic car too.
Not like this one, though.

368
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,708
This is a real beauty.

369
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,274
I notice you got two new tyres.

370
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,470
Imports. Brand-new imports.
I sure could use one of those.

371
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,593
A pair, Lieutenant.
You should always buy tyres in pairs.

372
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,429
I bought those last night. I had a blow-out
on the way down to the Springs.

373
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,993
Oh...

374
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:32,195
Say, you don't mind if I just
feel the wheel? Is that all right?

375
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,275
Sure.

376
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:38,269
You know, I never...
never actually sat in one of these before.

377
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,799
Aw, Mr Jennings, this is sure some car.

378
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:51,394
How long would it take, say from
Palm Springs, in a road-burner like this?

379
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,472
- That depends on traffic.
- Oh, the traffic, right.

380
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,919
Right...

381
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:04,554
And that's all you found by the safe?
Her draft pages from the last manuscript?

382
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:08,832
That's all there was, the secretary
thinks - except for the jewellery.

383
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,317
You didn't happen to notice...
a little black book?

384
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,558
You know, the type
that a writer might keep notes in?

385
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:21,832
It could've been anywhere in the house -
the bedroom, somewhere else...

386
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,520
I'm afraid not.
We've gone through the whole house.

387
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:29,156
- A little black book? Is it important?
- No, no. I was just wondering...

388
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,272
<i>- Who are you?
- I'm a detective.</i>

389
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,710
That's Lieutenant Columbo.
He's in charge of the case.

390
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,956
You don't say?

391
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,359
If my sister was killed by some lunatic
thief, why aren't you out looking for him?

392
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,755
Oh, I'm on my way right now.

393
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:50,431
And don't you worry, because
if I don't find your sister's killer quick,

394
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,199
my wife might never
let me back in my house again.

395
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,710
So I'll just, er, get out of your way now.

396
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:03,232
Oh, but Mr Jennings?
You've already been such a help.

397
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,717
I wonder if you wouldn't mind showing me
around the neighbourhood a bit, too?

398
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,910
Well, go on, do it!

399
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,189
What's his name?

400
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,437
Oh, you poor boy!

401
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,154
<i>Mrs Shannon,
the lieutenant wants to know</i>

402
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,748
if you've seen any strangers
down here lately.

403
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,599
Specifically this morning -
was there anyone around?

404
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:33,589
Only it doesn't have to be a stranger.
Maybe there was a car you heard?

405
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,712
- What?
- Or saw, I mean.

406
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:41,109
Well, I don't get up early.
I'm no jogger.

407
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,359
Oh, Wayne! How can you stand it?

408
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,711
Maybe around dawn?
Or a little earlier, maybe?

409
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,435
Mr Jennings says you and your husband
go running sometimes.

410
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:56,156
Oh, yeah, we do several miles every day.
Mostly down at the beach, but...

411
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,909
Oh, on the way down there and back?
This morning? Er...

412
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,068
- Nobody, I guess.
- Or a car? Maybe a car?

413
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,034
Oh... No... No, I'm positive, Lieutenant,
there was nothing.

414
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:13,073
But you said you were an early-morning
riser, just like Ms Goren was.

415
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,510
Well, the trouble is
this morning I overslept.

416
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,792
Father didn't waken me, the way
he usually does. Isn't that right, Father?

417
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:24,310
Why should I? Damned snow
kept up for over half an hour.

418
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:27,637
- Snow? Here?
- On the TV!

419
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,558
She missed her yoga,
I missed the early news...

420
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,593
We're on cable. They always seem
to work on it first thing in the morning.

421
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,235
So maybe some men from the
cable company were working in this area?

422
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,874
Maybe, hell!
We're always having trouble.

423
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,798
Now, that's enough about trouble, Father.

424
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,710
Wayne, I'm sure the lieutenant wouldn't
mind waiting while I fixed a cup of tea.

425
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:52,116
- You are welcome...
- No, no, but that's all right for him.

426
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,800
Thank you, ma'am. Excuse me.

427
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:59,838
I really can't stay either.
Maybe some other time? OK.

428
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,918
<i>Oh, we got out there
a little before dawn.</i>

429
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:20,397
There's a cable terminal on that road
which fans out to all those houses.

430
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:24,035
- That's where the trouble was.
- Did you see any other cars?

431
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:29,393
No, I don't think so. Least, I didn't notice
any headlights, even after it lightened up.

432
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,272
No, I'm sure I didn't.

433
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,437
Not even cars that seemed
to belong in this neighbourhood?

434
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,028
- Not this morning.
- What about people, then?

435
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,789
Well, some days you see a man and
a woman in sweats headed for the beach.

436
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,515
But it's a quiet area. It's the ones
that are different that you notice.

437
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,428
Like yesterday I saw a man
wandering around with field glasses.

438
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,677
But that was much later.
I figured he was bird-watching.

439
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:56,191
- Nobody like that this morning.
- Bird-watching? On private property?

440
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,791
Look. Here's our work log.
The times are on it.

441
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,549
- We were parked here about 40 minutes.
- This could be a big help.

442
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,275
But I was at the controls. It was
my partner who was up in the basket.

443
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,709
Well, I'll be back to see him.

444
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,195
Now I'm gonna go watch a little TV.

445
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,476
<i>But where do you find models
for these terrific guys,</i>

446
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:24,434
<i>who would rather look at you
instead of themselves?</i>

447
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,270
<i>Well, my mother used to drag us
to old Errol Flynn movies,</i>

448
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,313
<i>and I think I must've read lvanhoe
50 times.</i>

449
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:38,719
<i>You mean you just made up all those
faithful, brave, unselfish heroes?</i>

450
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,628
<i>I mean, no models at all?</i>

451
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,629
<i>He's a friend of mine.</i>

452
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,753
<i>- But what about those eyelashes?
- Lieutenant.</i>

453
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,359
Yeah?

454
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:58,235
When my secretary said you wanted
to see this, I was quite agreeable.

455
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,875
Now she tells me you keep re-running it,
over and over.

456
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,595
<i>- She's so pretty.
- I was always too busy, I guess.</i>

457
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,632
Would you mind
turning down the sound?

458
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:12,389
Oh, sure. Er... What button is it?

459
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,512
Now, what I said was that
your baby sister, she's so beautiful.

460
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,518
Theresa was only two years
younger than I, Lieutenant.

461
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,598
Oh, look, I didn't mean... No.

462
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:30,191
You know, I had this younger brother, a
year and seven months younger than me,

463
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,472
but I called him baby, so did everybody
else, so I just said that automatically.

464
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,352
Never mind.

465
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,189
But you're right, of course.
She never had a facelift, either.

466
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:45,952
Facelift? Her? No...
No, she's a natural beauty.

467
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,275
And she's so sweet to everybody.

468
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,597
Even when they ask her dumb questions,
look how sweet she is.

469
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,075
I thought you were out
looking for her killer.

470
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,670
Oh, I am. There's just some things
I wanna learn about her first.

471
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,917
Like what?
Like she never quite ever grew up?

472
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,508
Never stopped talking to strangers?

473
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,508
Was always the fairy princess
in the family?

474
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,154
Except that hasn't bothered me
since high school,

475
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,431
when she got all the dates
and won all the English prizes,

476
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,358
because I discovered
I knew how to make money.

477
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,232
For everybody.

478
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,989
And she discovered
just how much she needed me.

479
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,680
Excuse me, ma'am.
It's just this part here.

480
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,156
<i>His name is Wayne. Wayne Jennings.</i>

481
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,749
It's her and him that I'm curious about,
because I've been noticing,

482
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,190
this Mr Jennings, he sure knows
how to get along with women.

483
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,278
- Oh, please.
- All except you, that is.

484
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,472
Would you want your sister
to marry someone that much younger,

485
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:47,388
without a real job, without a future,
with no money? Wayne has nothing.

486
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,432
You know, I was wondering about that.
Money.

487
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:55,634
I mean, she must've had quite a bit of it.
But now he's not gonna get any.

488
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,877
- Unless there's maybe some insurance.
- Insurance?

489
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,358
Well, people who travel a lot, they always
seem to have a lot of extra policies.

490
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,233
As far as I know, I'm her sole beneficiary.

491
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,079
That's what I mean.
So there can't be any connection

492
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,478
between her deciding to get married
and her being dead. Could there?

493
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:23,600
<i>It's Wayne Jennings I love and...
 I've just decided I'm going to marry him...</i>

494
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:28,874
Are you telling me there's a possibility
it wasn't a thief who killed my sister?

495
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,560
Oh, no, ma'am,
I'm not suggesting anything yet.

496
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,355
I haven't even seen
a preliminary lab report. No, I just...

497
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,358
Would you like to know
why I didn't approve of Wayne?

498
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,870
Why I thought he was
so terribly, terribly wrong for my sister?

499
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,434
<i>Would you like to hear
what I know about him?</i>

500
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,269
Make yourself comfortable - it'll take
a long time to go through each of...

501
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,429
Honey, don't bother me now.

502
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,073
Oh.

503
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,394
It's for you.

504
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,715
That other lieutenant.

505
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,718
Er, Schultz, don't bother me now.

506
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,558
All right, so you found a bird-watcher.

507
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:14,958
So what if he won't talk?
Well, tell me about it later.

508
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,993
Just hold everything! Wait for me.

509
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:24,237
I think I'll talk about it later. I have
to get back out to the house. Excuse me.

510
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,875
What's your full name?

511
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,398
Where do you live?

512
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,512
Why don't you have any ID?

513
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,909
What were you doing out there?

514
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,872
Oh, you got here.

515
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,753
- Is this the bird guy?
- Yeah, but he's no warbler.

516
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,998
Neighbour saw him standing by his car,
looking over here with his field glasses.

517
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,793
Accused him of trespassing.
He just laughed.

518
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:36,230
- He's a clam. He knows all his rights.
- Oh, he's one of those.

519
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:40,638
Yeah. And listen. Palm Springs called.
They located that tyre place for you.

520
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,558
The man is there now.
He confirmed the sale of the tyres.

521
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,433
Oh, that's terrific.
Can you get him back on the line?

522
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,472
Which first?
Want me to take him apart or call the guy?

523
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,912
No, let's do it all together. McCurdy's
in the living room, we take him in,

524
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,429
have that call
switched to the living room...

525
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,872
And where's Mr Jennings?
I want him too. I want everybody.

526
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,116
I hope you know what you're doing.

527
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,554
Excuse me.
Lt Columbo wants you downstairs.

528
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,319
What's he want? Is it something new?

529
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,356
<i>Uh-huh...</i>

530
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,038
Uh-huh...

531
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,549
<i>He was not registered? Uh-huh. Yeah.</i>

532
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,716
Well, that's good, Sergeant.
No, that's good work.

533
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,437
Yes, I think I have it all,
but just let me make sure.

534
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:40,634
Mr Jennings, your car licence plate
is WEJ 1221, isn't it?

535
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:44,992
- That's right.
- Yeah, that's it, Sergeant. Thanks again.

536
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:49,752
- What's the matter? Am I getting a ticket?
- Oh, no, no, nothing like that.

537
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:56,636
No, I just thought you'd like to know the
Palm Springs police located the garage

538
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:01,072
where you bought those tyres
and they confirmed what you said.

539
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,350
Well, of course. Why wouldn't they?

540
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:07,678
Oh, no reason. In a murder case we have
to double-check everything, that's all.

541
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,473
<i>Um...</i>

542
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:16,432
Oh... Well, there is one small thing here
that I don't understand, though.

543
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,791
Your mileage. The guy said
that the garage wrote it down...

544
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,434
you know, for the tyre guarantee slip.

545
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:27,156
76 thou... Let's see...
Did I subtract that right?

546
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:32,434
- What the devil are you talking about?
- Oh, I'm just figuring it, that's all.

547
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,435
I think you said
that you got a call late last night

548
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,348
and that made you pile into the car
and drive up here from Palm Springs,

549
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,438
and then you said you stopped in town,
you had breakfast...

550
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,835
Yes, that's right.
I told you, Wayne called me

551
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,509
from a very noisy restaurant
in Los Angeles at exactly 7:15.

552
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,710
- Sit down, Mavis.
- Well, he did.

553
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,159
Sit down.

554
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:58,070
Yes, but it's 110 miles from Palm Springs
to Los Angeles, plus it's another 20 here.

555
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,033
That's... 130.

556
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,799
Only when I looked in your car
this morning,

557
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,992
I just happened to notice
your mileage speedometer,

558
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:11,750
and when I subtract the garage mileage
from mine, it's 170.

559
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,871
That's 40 miles too much.

560
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,551
Well, of course. Palm Springs is all
spread out - Indian Wells, Palm Desert...

561
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,639
After I bought the tyres I went looking
for some of the tennis gang,

562
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,832
we went a couple of places for drinks,
then back to the club.

563
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,714
- 40 miles is nothing down there.
- Oh, I know. And we'll check on that.

564
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:33,877
Because there's one other thing
the guy said...

565
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,072
The hotel and tennis club
where the players stay,

566
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,873
they don't have your name
on the registry, so...

567
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,709
So what? What concern is it of yours
where I stayed, went for drinks,

568
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,671
or anything else in Palm Springs?

569
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:49,349
- I think I know where he probably stayed.
- Jess, stay out of this.

570
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:55,112
Why? You've been trying to get a part
in Paul Rocca's new picture, haven't you?

571
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,515
What are you worried about?

572
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,749
There. Every agent
has everyone's number.

573
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,552
- Thank you.
- No problem.

574
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,274
- Jess, why do you have to do this?
- Why not?

575
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:11,598
Don't you realise I'm just as unhappy
as you? It's not my fault Theresa died.

576
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:15,793
You're not gonna call that number, are
you? It's none of your damn business!

577
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:22,314
- I don't think the captain's gonna like this.
- When a snowball starts to roll, push.

578
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,115
Hello?

579
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,355
Hello. I'd like to speak
to Mr Paul Rocca, please.

580
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:46,472
<i>I'm sorry, Mr Rocca is in New York
for a few days.</i>

581
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:49,672
Well, it was a Mr Wayne Jennings
that I'm calling about.

582
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,190
I understand that Mr Jennings
was staying at Mr Rocca's house?

583
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:56,312
Who? Mr Jennings?

584
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,788
Oh, that tennis player, Wayne Jennings.

585
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:06,278
Well, I suppose my husband might've told
him someone could use our guest house.

586
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,790
He wouldn't be there now, though.

587
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,593
I'm sure the tennis matches
have started already.

588
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,280
Oh, he would've left
much earlier than that.

589
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:20,599
As I understand it, he got a phone call
some time after midnight last night?

590
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,154
<i>How on earth would I know?
Who is this, anyway?</i>

591
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:28,035
Oh, didn't I say? Er, Lieutenant Columbo,
Los Angeles police.

592
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:33,029
I wanted to ask you if you know
what time that phone call came in?

593
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:37,119
It might've been just before he left
Palm Springs, if you know when that was.

594
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,874
Well, I, um...
I didn't know he did leave...

595
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,549
Um, look here, what's happened?
Mr Jennings is OK, isn't he?

596
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:50,116
Oh, he's fine - I think. Hold on, ma'am.
Someone else will explain.

597
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,629
- Why don't you tell him the truth?
- I have.

598
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,228
No, you've been lying.
Just tell him the truth!

599
00:47:56,360 --> 00:48:00,035
- Why don't you get him to tell the truth?!
- How do you know he's lying?

600
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:04,073
- That phone call was a little after 3am!
- What are you talking about?

601
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:08,239
And it wasn't from a friend of Theresa's
who told him what she said on TV.

602
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:11,352
- It was from Theresa herself!
- That's ridiculous!

603
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:15,996
Telling you to get lost! Telling you
she would never, never marry you!

604
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:19,715
- She's making it up!
- That she never wanted to see you again!

605
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:23,150
Telling you that she realised
what a damn fool she'd been!

606
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,430
How do you know these things, ma'am?

607
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:28,791
For God's sake, because I was here
when she made the phone call!

608
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,831
Now just get him to tell the truth!

609
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:35,033
I'm not gonna say another word as long
as you're around! Get her out of here!

610
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:39,073
- You're a liar! You're a liar!
- All right, calm down. Calm down.

611
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:45,036
Now, Ms McCurdy... this gentleman here
is obviously a private investigator.

612
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,196
Does he work for you, maybe?

613
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:50,915
I hired him a few days ago.
Charlie, tell him everything you know.

614
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,554
Yeah. Glad to get off the hook.

615
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,194
Not much
on Mr Jennings' background yet,

616
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:59,392
but there is something about the car
might interest you.

617
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,159
And a newspaper delivery guy
you might wanna pick up.

618
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:06,831
See, I paid him a few bucks to keep
an eye out and I got a call from him.

619
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,555
Says he saw that red Jag of Mr Jennings'
this morning, around seven.

620
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:13,672
- What? Where?
- Down the highway a mile or two.

621
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:17,634
Said it passed him like
he was standing still, on its way south,

622
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,672
heading back into town from here.

623
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,471
You got him?

624
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:28,438
Jess, I couldn't help it!
I don't even know how it happened,

625
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:31,074
except when I went into her bedroom
there was a gun

626
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,317
and there was a black notebook
filled with lies about me!

627
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:38,592
And I went down to the study and I found
her there on the floor, near the open safe.

628
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:43,157
I don't know what happened. I just
couldn't control myself! I must've...

629
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,590
Oh, God, I didn't know what I was doing!

630
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,439
<i>Oh, my God...</i>

631
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,912
I never saw a guy unwind that fast.

632
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,433
- Miranda?
- I guess you'd better.

633
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,192
All right,
you have the right to remain silent.

634
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:11,074
- You have... If you give up the right...
- Lieutenant? Lieutenant?

635
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,191
Don't interrupt!

636
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:16,835
Just came in.
Message from Ballistics there, too.

637
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:23,509
Schultz. Schultz, stop. Schultz.

638
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,515
The preliminary autopsy
says Ms Goren was shot twice,

639
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:33,349
once through the heart with her own gun,
that little.25...

640
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,756
that's the gun Mr Jennings
just said he fired...

641
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:41,590
But that wasn't what killed her.
What killed her was a shot in the head,

642
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:46,999
and that, says Ballistics,
was from a different gun, a.22 calibre.

643
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:52,831
And it was fired quite a bit earlier.
Over a half-hour earlier, in fact.

644
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,552
"The conclusion of the preliminary
autopsy report is as follows:"

645
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:06,313
Whoever shot Ms Goren in the heart later
with her own.25 calibre just...

646
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,560
"just shot a dead body."

647
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,750
- What happened?
- He fainted.

648
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,952
Uh, Ms McCurdy?
Please can you wait a minute, ma'am?

649
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:42,913
- Please, no.
- Er, ma'am...

650
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:48,068
Lieutenant... that man who said I could go
is your superior, isn't he?

651
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:52,318
Oh, yes. The real experts have to take
statements in an unusual case like this.

652
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,795
But there is one more question
I wanted to ask.

653
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:58,595
Of course. Why I didn't tell you
about Theresa's phone call?

654
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:02,599
Well, how could I? At least
until I had a chance to talk to Wayne.

655
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:06,918
I mean, who would believe
he was capable of killing her?

656
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:11,716
No matter how greedy or ambitious
or... unfaithful a man is.

657
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:15,037
Besides, everyone was saying
it was a robbery.

658
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,397
Oh, God. What are they doing now?

659
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:26,474
Oh, taking him downtown, I guess.
A lot of reporters are starting to show up.

660
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:30,070
- Downtown?
- Oh, not to arrest him, ma'am.

661
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:34,079
There's no law
against shooting a dead body.

662
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:39,478
No, it's all right, fellas. I'll be OK.

663
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,431
I'll make it.

664
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:55,559
Er, ma'am? You didn't answer
the question I was gonna ask.

665
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:01,073
You realise, don't you, that now I'm gonna
have to start all over from the beginning?

666
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,636
- Well?
- What time did you leave here last night?

667
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:13,555
I was out late last night. I drove by here a
little after midnight. The lights were on.

668
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,194
I found Theresa
had been drinking and crying

669
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:20,836
and making up her mind to get rid of him -
I'd sent her Charlie's little black book.

670
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,918
I shouldn't have -
she took it far too seriously.

671
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:29,160
Anyway, after she insisted on making
that phone call, I got her to bed somehow,

672
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:34,274
and I left here... to go home at about 3am.
All right, Lieutenant?

673
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,753
When you see a snowball
starting to roll...

674
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,111
push.

675
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,390
Coming through.

676
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:34,911
Lieutenant? Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm right in the middle of a shotgun job.

677
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:39,670
OK, Doc, I won't bother you long. It's her
I wanna talk to you about, Ms Goren.

678
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,678
Damn shame - beautiful woman.
My wife read all her books.

679
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,870
You better nail somebody soon.

680
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:50,677
I wanna make sure of the time of death.
Could it have been as early as 3:30?

681
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:54,270
Didn't you get the preliminary?
The shot to the head that killed her,

682
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,960
I said at 5:30am at the earliest.

683
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,469
What about the other shot,
through her heart?

684
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:02,717
Any chance of error? I mean
about its happening so much later?

685
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,114
Absolutely not.

686
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:08,438
It's too bad the assistant ME didn't notice
the internal bleeding in the heart wound.

687
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,835
I'm surprised
you didn't notice it yourself.

688
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,678
Well, actually, Doc...

689
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:17,032
Anyhow, she was dead at least
a half an hour before the second shot.

690
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:22,871
Look, I've gotta finish up on this guy
who tried to put both barrels in his mouth.

691
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,353
There's something else.

692
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,438
The way Ms Goren was found,
in her underwear and all...

693
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:31,235
- Early riser, somebody said.
- But like you say, she sure was pretty.

694
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:35,035
Dressed that way, could somebody
have maybe roughed her up?

695
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:38,789
Sexually molested? No.
No, of course not.

696
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:44,313
Er, not a sign of contusions, no blows,
no roughing up at all.

697
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:48,513
Here, come on in.
We'll talk about it while I finish up.

698
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,472
Thanks, Doc. That'll be all for now.

699
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,190
Oh, I'm sorry.

700
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:07,240
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

701
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,473
Micki, I thought I told you
to go home half an hour ago.

702
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,672
I know. But I decided I won't,
not until you do.

703
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,279
Oh, for God's sake.

704
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:26,350
Oh, Jess. It's almost 7:30.
The cleaning men are already here.

705
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,392
So, why don't you let me
drive you home myself,

706
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,239
and I'll have the car
sent to your house first thing.

707
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,715
Don't be silly. I'm perfectly all right.

708
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:39,630
It just seems like watching this over and
over again will only make you feel worse.

709
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:43,275
And besides,
you haven't even had any dinner yet.

710
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:47,951
It just occurred to me, maybe somebody
followed her home after the show.

711
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:50,469
- What?
- No...

712
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,480
Oh, I... I doubt that.

713
00:56:55,800 --> 00:57:02,876
But I suppose it is sort of a relief to know
that it wasn't him who... who killed her.

714
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,468
I am so glad you told me that.

715
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:11,791
Uh... It is, isn't it? A relief, I mean?

716
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:19,072
Just make sure you turn this thing off
before you leave.

717
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:30,551
<i>Paging Dr Clay.
You're needed in the reception area.</i>

718
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:34,195
<i>Dr Clay, please report
to the reception area.</i>

719
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,595
<i>Dr Wilson,
pick up the courtesy phone.</i>

720
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:47,792
Whoa, whoa. That's good. Thank you.

721
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:53,791
- Sorry, sir, no visitors allowed.
- It's OK. He's a policeman.

722
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,878
Oh. Well, maybe you'd like
to leave that for Mr Jennings.

723
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,638
Oh, no, no. I just dropped by.

724
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:03,311
- Dear, pour him a glass, then run along.
- Thank you, sir, but I just had a root beer.

725
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,159
OK. Go on, scoot.

726
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:12,998
Boy, this is sure different
from my hernia operation.

727
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:17,079
It's my lawyer's idea, putting me in here
overnight to dodge those reporters.

728
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:20,510
- She fixed it with the doctors.
- Oh, I bet they're worried too.

729
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:24,838
Because, I tell ya, I sure was shocked
when you collapsed like that.

730
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:28,316
I mean, any guy that climbs mountains
and sky-dives...

731
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:31,432
I never came that close
to passing out before in my life.

732
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:35,109
But don't you realise the shocks I'd had?

733
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:39,677
Theresa knew I wasn't perfect. She knew
I played around with a few other women...

734
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:41,631
but she even kidded me about it.

735
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,275
Yes - you know, I've noticed,
women, they just seem to take to you.

736
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,516
But it didn't mean anything.

737
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:52,111
For Theresa to turn on me like that, to
read a few filthy things in that notebook

738
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,470
and then to suddenly throw me over?

739
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:59,594
She threatened to write a book about me,
to make a best-selling joke of my life!

740
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:06,034
I tell you, I went into her bedroom...
and there was that notebook...

741
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:09,835
and there was the gun...
I grabbed it out of the drawer.

742
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:15,512
You know, we thought that she just took it
downstairs because she heard something.

743
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:19,713
Oh, how I wish she had.
She might still be alive.

744
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:23,879
Don't you understand? I took it.

745
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,992
Then when I found her in the study
next to the open safe,

746
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:32,274
there were pieces of my love letters all
over the floor, and something inside me...

747
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:36,072
It's all in my confession.
Can't you just read it?

748
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,792
In your confession here,

749
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:41,071
you said you didn't remember
if you fired one shot or two...

750
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,873
I didn't know what I was doing!
Can't you figure it out?

751
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,150
We'll certainly try our best.

752
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:50,751
Incidentally, we didn't find
any pieces of love letters on the floor.

753
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,872
Of course you didn't. I burned 'em.

754
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,549
There were still some coals
in the fireplace.

755
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:01,392
I just burned 'em up,
got the hell out of there.

756
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:04,751
If I can just ask you one thing
about Charlie's notebook...

757
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,350
and I don't want you to go into it, sir,
it's too upsetting.

758
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:11,392
I know what's in it,
Charlie told me already.

759
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:15,149
<i>But you didn't say what you
did with Charlie's notebook.</i>

760
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:19,193
Lieutenant, I already asked Helen
to call your office about that.

761
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,754
- Helen?
- She does my taxes.

762
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:26,874
She's the woman I left a message for
on my way up from Palm Springs.

763
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:32,598
Anyway, what I... what I did
with that damn notebook, I...

764
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:35,951
I threw it in a dumpster
on my way in to breakfast.

765
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:39,311
Which is just as dumb
as everything else I did after...

766
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:43,911
Calling Mavis from that restaurant,
buying all those flowers...

767
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:50,479
Sir, why don't you get some sleep now,
and, uh...

768
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:56,952
I just wanna say that I'll have a car
come around at ten tomorrow morning.

769
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:01,233
Why? I thought your captain
said I was free to go.

770
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,271
Oh, of course.

771
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:06,472
But I guess you realise that now...

772
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:12,115
you're the one person I can count on most
to help find the real killer.

773
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:15,437
And we will, don't you worry.

774
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:35,755
And Mr Jennings,
he did leave a message?

775
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:39,156
Yes. He called on his way through town
at 6:25 this morning.

776
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,589
- How do you know that?
- The machine.

777
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:44,837
- It even records the time of hang-ups.
- Oh, I see, yeah.

778
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,712
Shh. His call is next.

779
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:49,752
<i>Helen, it's me, Wayne.
I just stopped in town for some gas.</i>

780
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:52,758
<i>I hope you can hear me -
this crazy traffic on the freeway.</i>

781
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,236
<i>Listen, my plans are changed.
 I'm on my way back to Theresa's place.</i>

782
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:58,828
<i>I'll call you when I
get a chance, OK?</i>

783
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:02,669
Did you hear how fast he was talking?
How upset he sounded?

784
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,870
I could tell the minute I played that back

785
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,117
that that woman was putting him
through some kind of wringer.

786
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:11,277
- Wringer?
- Wayne is usually so easy-going.

787
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:15,439
I always knew when she was driving him
up the wall with her emotional outbursts,

788
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:20,839
her "change of life" moods,
her insatiable...

789
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:24,717
Shut up, Helen.

790
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:28,517
I guess you kinda like him yourself.

791
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,154
Well, I'm a realist, that's all.

792
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,551
I take what I can get.

793
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:36,752
- There, 6:25am.
- Oh, I better write that down.

794
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:39,838
- No, here, you can have the whole tape.
- Oh, thank you.

795
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:44,033
You don't happen to know what he meant
when he said he'd call you back later?

796
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,152
- No. Why?
- Oh, it's probably not important.

797
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:51,876
There's one other thing.
I see on your door that you sell insurance.

798
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,675
Now, we've already checked
Ms Goren's insurance agents,

799
01:02:55,800 --> 01:03:00,749
and they say that the only beneficiary
to her life policies

800
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,950
is her sister, Ms McCurdy.

801
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,914
- All but one.
- Oh?

802
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:09,513
When Wayne was first
trying to impress her,

803
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:12,518
he got me to write out
an all-risks life policy for him.

804
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:17,156
When Ms Goren heard about it, she sent
a note saying she wanted the same thing.

805
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:20,397
She didn't want
to bother her people about it.

806
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:24,354
Wayne had insisted
that she be his beneficiary,

807
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:30,316
so, naturally... the great lady
must reciprocate the grand gesture.

808
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:33,830
Would you mind telling me
how much those policies are for?

809
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:37,396
Look, Wayne's already told me
he's not getting any money.

810
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:41,513
Anything coming to him
goes directly to Theresa's charities.

811
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:43,232
All right.

812
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:48,434
But, if you must know,
the policy's fairly impressive. $1 million.

813
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:52,154
$1 million? Oh...

814
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:54,555
That's fairly impressive.

815
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:35,833
Lieutenant, I sent your driver home,
drove my own car here. Is that all right?

816
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:38,235
Oh, sure.
You're free to do whatever you want.

817
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:41,397
You're gonna be happy to know
we just found the other bullet.

818
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,431
It was buried in those ashes.

819
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:46,313
- Other bullet?
- From Ms Goren's gun.

820
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:50,069
That second shot that you couldn't
remember whether you fired or not?

821
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:53,749
And it all makes a lot of sense.
You said you came in from over there,

822
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:57,953
and from across the room you saw her
kneeling, leaning against the open safe.

823
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:01,152
You had no idea she'd already been shot.

824
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,840
You saw the love letters
all ripped up on the floor,

825
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:08,875
you assumed she just took 'em out
and, in a blind rage, you fired.

826
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,436
And if one of those bullets
just missed by a little,

827
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:16,553
it would've ricocheted off these stones
right into the fireplace.

828
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:18,955
And that's supposed to make me happy?

829
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:22,152
It explains a little more
about what happened, that's all.

830
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:23,269
Great.

831
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:29,873
Speaking of bullets, that earlier shot
that the real killer fired into her head,

832
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,471
well, Ballistics say that was from a
.22 calibre, and that's a very popular gun.

833
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:37,558
- You don't say.
- Well, I only mention it, sir,

834
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:40,877
because I noticed in your room
there was a gun collection,

835
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,595
and I was wondering if maybe,
when you said that nothing was missing...

836
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:48,395
No, Lieutenant, I do not own one.
The killer must've brought his own.

837
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:51,080
Can we get out of this room?
It gives me the chills.

838
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,634
Oh, I'm sorry.
Yeah, we can wait in the other room.

839
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:56,957
For what? That cherry-picker
parked down the road, maybe?

840
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:58,957
Oh, are they here already?

841
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:02,516
Oh, let's go.
They could be our best witnesses.

842
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,434
Witnesses? To what?

843
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:09,631
OK, hit it, Rod.

844
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:16,313
Don't worry about a thing.
It can carry you all. Tell 'em, McGee.

845
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:19,352
It may be a little crowded,
but if you wanna see what I saw...

846
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:22,756
Right. And I need him
to help tell me what I'm lookin' at.

847
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:26,998
- You better put this on, Lieutenant.
- No, no thanks. Never use 'em.

848
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:29,634
- You'll be sorry.
- Hey, I'll take it.

849
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,433
All right, Rod, bring it down.

850
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:39,312
Looks shaky, doesn't it?
Don't worry about a thing.

851
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:43,118
- It'll be all right.
- Here we go, Lieutenant. Pile in.

852
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:47,153
See, these guys say they didn't notice
a single other car on the road

853
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:51,159
all the time
that they were up there yesterday.

854
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,916
All aboard.

855
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:02,873
That's where you were parked?
The whole time?

856
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,514
What, the truck? Yeah. Whole time.

857
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:07,676
Watch the branches.

858
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:14,157
And that was from, uh...
5:50am until about?

859
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,396
6:25. That's when we left here.

860
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:20,308
That's about the same time
I stopped in LA and called Helen.

861
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:23,238
- Just a little before 6:30.
- 6:30, that's right.

862
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:27,353
Now, for the 40 minutes before that, sir,
where were you guys?

863
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:31,268
We were up there, right next to this pole,
working on that terminal there.

864
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:35,996
But I went back and forth
a couple of times to that other pole.

865
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:39,556
To that pole right over there.
You see where the lines fan out?

866
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,716
See there? That's Ms Goren's lines.

867
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:45,515
You can see her whole driveway
from up here. Even part of the garage.

868
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:48,438
- Can you?
- And over there's Mrs Shannon's place.

869
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:52,633
And the one farther down, that's where
that lady lives with her father.

870
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:57,390
But you notice, Lieutenant,
you can see the whole road from here.

871
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,951
Now you understand why we're so sure
there weren't any cars.

872
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:06,073
And the view's a whole lot better
from over here.

873
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:09,670
See? I worked on that wire yesterday.
Oh, gee...

874
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:12,837
- What the hell is that?
- Crows. They're nesting up here.

875
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:15,155
They were really after me yesterday.

876
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:18,111
Milo!

877
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:24,228
At least now we know the murderer
didn't come or go by car, right?

878
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:27,875
Not while we were here. But look around -
you see all this shrubbery?

879
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,754
You can see for yourself, anybody
could've been sneaking around on foot,

880
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:34,155
we wouldn't have noticed them.

881
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:37,511
Uh, not on foot, I guess you wouldn't.

882
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:41,997
Sir, you don't happen to know
where her sister lives, Ms McCurdy?

883
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:44,395
A couple of miles down the beach.

884
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:22,798
You looking for something, Lieutenant?

885
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:24,638
What?

886
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,796
Oh. How are you?

887
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:30,516
It's all right. Let him in, Rosa.

888
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:48,753
- Boy, this sure is some place you got.
- Well, thank you.

889
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:51,348
Is that all you came to tell me?

890
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:56,031
Well, no. Oh, but there have been no new
developments, if that's what you meant.

891
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:59,197
All right. Care for a drink?
Wanna sit down?

892
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:02,551
Oh, thank you, but I better not -
I got sand all over my clothes.

893
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:05,592
- Make yourself comfortable.
- Oh, thank you, ma'am.

894
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:07,676
I know what I wanted to ask you.

895
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:11,156
You said you were with your sister
the night before she died.

896
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:13,669
What time did you say you left? 3am?

897
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:15,950
Yes, that's what I said.

898
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:21,757
I ask because she went to bed so late, and
by dawn she was already half-dressed.

899
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:25,668
- Would she get up that early?
- Yes. Theresa always got up early.

900
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:28,758
Besides, she was expecting
to go to Seattle, remember?

901
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:30,472
She had a lot to attend to.

902
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:34,991
- You arranged that, didn't you?
- What? The book signing?

903
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:38,874
I just assumed you did. I mean,
considering how you must've felt

904
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,798
when you saw her saying
all those things on TV

905
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:45,071
about marrying this man
and being in love with him...

906
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:50,069
Look, I wanted to get her as far away from
him as fast as possible. Wouldn't you?

907
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:53,158
I guess I would, ma'am,
if she was my little sister.

908
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,874
She was a born innocent, Lieutenant.

909
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,310
She was always getting too serious
about the wrong men.

910
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:03,194
Oh, I know he's attractive, but she didn't
know how to handle a man like that.

911
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:05,390
She didn't know how to use him
and dump him.

912
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:10,594
Well, she did seem like
such a trusting, soft-mannered lady.

913
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:14,235
Except maybe when she read Mr Jennings
the riot act on the phone.

914
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:16,669
What the hell are you really doing here?

915
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,758
To ask permission
to check with the telephone company.

916
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:25,432
- About your long-distance calls, that is.
- My what? From here?

917
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:29,075
Well, I'm sure it's just a mistake -
you know how those computers are...

918
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:34,035
but so far there doesn't seem to be
any record of that call to Palm Springs.

919
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:36,469
Not from your sister's house, at least.

920
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:42,357
So I got to wondering... Because I notice,
Ms McCurdy, you're a little like myself.

921
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:47,508
My wife, when she gets all steamed up,
I don't say much

922
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:50,950
until I know that it's safe to say it.

923
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:53,833
And I noticed in Mr Jennings' confession

924
01:11:53,960 --> 01:12:00,035
that all those awful words he said your
sister used, they just didn't sound like her.

925
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:05,314
So what I got to wondering was... Well,
I had this other brother in high school.

926
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:10,514
He was older than me and he used to get
all these calls from all these girls,

927
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:13,029
and I discovered
when I answered the phone

928
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:17,312
that if I grooved a little and grumbled,
sounded like him,

929
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:24,676
then... wow, the offers he used to get and
the things these girls used to say to him.

930
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:28,395
Boy, it was like an education.
But it was easy to fool 'em.

931
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:32,672
All right. All right!
You made your damn point!

932
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:42,557
- I'm sorry.
- Like hell you are. You're not sorry.

933
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:48,153
You don't have to check the records.

934
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,992
Yes, I'm the one that made the phone call
early this morning.

935
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:54,714
<i>Oh, honey, I love you.
I love you so much.</i>

936
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:56,990
<i>- Shut up, you bastard!
- What?</i>

937
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:00,078
I'll never marry you. I'm not a fool!

938
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:04,796
<i>Theresa, have you been drinking?
Have you been talking to your meddling sister?</i>

939
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:06,512
<i>- No!
- I don't believe you.</i>

940
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:09,791
<i>Get some sleep. I'm coming home
tomorrow night and we'll talk.</i>

941
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:13,674
Don't you ever come back!
I hate you! I hate you!

942
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:19,395
But you don't understand.

943
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:24,230
You see, I pleaded with her.
I'd begged her, I'd argued with her.

944
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:26,635
I'd done everything.

945
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:29,035
But she just wouldn't...

946
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:33,997
I even got us both half-drunk.

947
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:39,229
But she wouldn't do it.

948
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:46,876
She said... she agreed she couldn't marry
him, she'd go to Seattle, do anything else,

949
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,833
but she couldn't do that,
she just wouldn't tell him.

950
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:54,033
She couldn't end it.
I got so mad. I got so mad.

951
01:13:55,360 --> 01:14:00,309
I put her to bed and I went home,
and I was so mad I picked up the phone...

952
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:03,830
My God... I shouldn't have been drinking.

953
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:07,077
- Ms McCurdy?
- Oh, God, Rosa, get out of here!

954
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:11,318
Yes, ma'am, but I just wanted to say
there's a telephone call for Lt Columbo.

955
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:14,591
All right, all right.
He'll take it in here. All right, go on.

956
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:29,989
<i>Shh! Quieto.
No digas que estoy aqu.</i>

957
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:36,629
I have a surprise for you.
Come on, I'll tell you.

958
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:42,439
All right, Schultz,
but if you could scare me up a ride...

959
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:45,120
Oh, you have? I'll be right out.

960
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:48,110
They found a gun. I'll have to leave.

961
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:52,119
Uh, look, I... I think I know
how painful that was...

962
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:55,550
Please, Lieutenant! Please!

963
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:57,511
Just go.

964
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:24,432
God, you look awful.

965
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:27,472
How did you get in here?

966
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,875
How long have you been here? Rosa!

967
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,036
I sent her to run an errand.

968
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:36,597
Oh, there's no need for her to know about
that bitchy little phone call of yours.

969
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:39,998
Yours. God, why didn't I guess?

970
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:42,757
Get out of here.

971
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:45,792
- I said get out.
- No. I'm not gonna leave.

972
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:51,392
And that phoney phone call of yours
isn't gonna leave, either.

973
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:54,637
All your life you'll think
it was your fault Theresa died,

974
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:56,955
because you made me do what I did.

975
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:59,594
Just get out of here. Go on, get out.

976
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:02,632
But I didn't kill her.
You just made me think that I did.

977
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:04,876
Stop it. Let go of me!

978
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,719
Not until you listen to me, Jess!

979
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:10,798
Because you didn't kill her either,
did you? Well, did you?!

980
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:13,229
Of course not! What a stupid thing to say!

981
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:18,115
Look at me, Jess. Don't you see?
I know the agony of what you're feeling.

982
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,276
We're both riddled with guilt,

983
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:24,632
and we both just did horrible things
only because we loved her.

984
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:29,038
For the last time...
get your hands off of me.

985
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:31,435
We deserve each other, Jess.

986
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:35,394
Maybe we need each other now,
to keep from hating ourselves forever.

987
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:38,876
Wayne Jennings, I hated myself
from the very moment

988
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,389
I made the mistake
of letting you meet my sister.

989
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:43,750
- You introduced me.
- It was a mistake.

990
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:46,075
- I asked you to do it.
- It was a mistake!

991
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:49,112
Have you ever thought
about why you're so angry, Jess?

992
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:52,391
Why you're so sorry you introduced us?

993
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:57,355
You lousy bastard!

994
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:00,474
Jessica, I've seen
how you've watched me.

995
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:02,955
Every time I was with her,
you watched me.

996
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:07,551
And you've seen how I've watched you.
How I've wanted you.

997
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:10,878
I hate you.

998
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:35,799
It was buried in a lot of other junk
over there.

999
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:38,673
- Metal detector picked it up. So did a dog.
- Dog?

1000
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:43,078
Right. The gun had been fired lately -
you could still smell it. And it was a.22.

1001
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,839
One of the traffic boys
is running it down to the lab.

1002
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:48,679
That path there,
that leads up to Ms Goren's house?

1003
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:53,032
That's right. You take it from Goren's
place to get up and down the beach.

1004
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:56,152
And the sister, that's her house,
that fifth house up there.

1005
01:17:56,280 --> 01:18:00,159
Right. So, we already know
that the killer came and went on foot.

1006
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:03,909
Now, if that turns out
to be the murder weapon...

1007
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:06,192
I think I'll wait in the morgue.

1008
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,792
What are you looking for?

1009
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:22,117
I don't know.
It's just something I noticed before.

1010
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:23,798
Er...

1011
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,514
You see that little speck there?

1012
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:30,996
Yeah, sure. So what?
Photographer should keep his lens clean.

1013
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,190
I don't think that's what it is.

1014
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:35,880
Hey, wanna see
something really interesting?

1015
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,232
This is an organ from a poison case.
Notice the purply-grey area...

1016
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:46,071
I just thought you'd show me some
clothes. Tell me the file number, maybe.

1017
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:48,430
Sorry.
Didn't know you were in such a hurry.

1018
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:51,836
I am now. I just decided.

1019
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:36,240
What the hell are you doing?

1020
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:38,351
Oh, Schultz.

1021
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:41,358
- Well...
- Never mind, I won't ask.

1022
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:44,677
The report's in. Ballistics said
it was the.22 that killed her.

1023
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:49,396
So what now? More beach-combing?
I've already asked for ten more men.

1024
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,954
I gotta go see her sister again.

1025
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:53,877
What?

1026
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:50,916
But she is not at home.

1027
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:54,874
She left shortly after you were here,
Lieutenant, several hours ago.

1028
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,911
All right, Mr Jennings, then.

1029
01:20:57,040 --> 01:21:00,112
Oh, he is with her.
They are both together.

1030
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:04,233
Excuse me, ma'am, but since both
their cars are here - I saw 'em myself...

1031
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:07,238
Well, Ms McCurdy has lots of cars.

1032
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:11,478
They took the Rolls. Mr Jennings
was driving. I saw them go myself.

1033
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:15,354
The Rolls? All right, where?
Where'd they go?

1034
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:21,071
Well, I heard a telephone,
some sales lady in Beverly Hills.

1035
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:24,431
There we go.
Now, the fitter can ease these shoulders...

1036
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:28,712
No, no, that'll be fine.
This isn't gonna work anyway.

1037
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:34,872
Oh, please!
It makes me look like a French poodle.

1038
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,434
Oh, it does not.
You just need a lighter colour.

1039
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:41,792
- Could we see something lighter?
- Certainly, sir.

1040
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:47,239
- Wayne, I just can't wear things like this.
- Of course you can.

1041
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:50,955
Do something with your hair...
You know what'd look fabulous with this?

1042
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:53,150
- What?
- A black linen dinner jacket.

1043
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:55,874
- Miss?
- And stop giving me orders.

1044
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:01,556
Look, I'm really sorry.
I'm just all mixed up. I'm all mixed up.

1045
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:06,551
Besides, I'm just going to Arrowhead
to get away from people - reporters, TV...

1046
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:10,355
Hey, hey... Shh... I'll take care
of all of them. Don't you worry.

1047
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:12,471
And I'll take good care of you.

1048
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:16,912
I just thought we'd sneak out for dinner,
so I'd like you to have some new clothes.

1049
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:22,478
All right. I just wanna get out of here
before I lose my mind.

1050
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:25,433
<i>And if I do go with you...</i>

1051
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:28,351
Oh, my God.

1052
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:36,952
Oh, there you are.
I've been looking all over for you two.

1053
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:41,358
- What is it? Do you have any new leads?
- Well, we found a gun.

1054
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:44,153
- I told you that.
- Does it mean anything?

1055
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:47,033
- Yes, sir. It's the murder weapon.
- It is?

1056
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:53,190
But I want you to know I finally realised it
couldn't have been a thief that did this.

1057
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:54,355
It what?

1058
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:57,517
Well, we know that when you shot
Ms Goren with her own gun

1059
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:59,358
she'd been dead for a while.

1060
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:03,598
Do you have to keep bringing it up? Can't
you see Ms McCurdy's suffered enough?

1061
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:08,714
I just want you to know that Ms Goren was
not shot in a struggle with an intruder.

1062
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:10,512
Well, if it wasn't an intruder...

1063
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:13,473
Don't say a word
till you've contacted your attorney.

1064
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:18,151
What I'm trying to say is that your sister
was probably shot in cold blood.

1065
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:21,272
- Maybe even while she was still asleep.
- Asleep?

1066
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:24,756
- Who would do such a thing?
- You don't even have to talk to him.

1067
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:28,156
Ms McCurdy, there's just one thing
I wanna know about your sister.

1068
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:31,078
Now, she was wearing white socks.
Knee-highs.

1069
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:35,671
And her secretary told me that she wore
those socks when she wore slacks.

1070
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:39,270
- Is that true?
- Her secretary was probably right. So?

1071
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:43,118
- Did she wear slacks often?
- No.

1072
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:46,835
- When did she wear 'em?
- When she wanted to be comfortable.

1073
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:49,428
Would she wear slacks
to travel on a plane?

1074
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:51,869
Theresa always wore slacks on a plane.

1075
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,709
- Well, that's it. I know who did it.
- What the hell are you talking about?

1076
01:23:55,840 --> 01:24:00,311
You, Mr Jennings. I guess you figured you
could be headed back to Palm Springs

1077
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:03,159
and beat the early-morning traffic.

1078
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:05,794
You could be playing tennis
before nine o'clock

1079
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:08,195
and nobody would even know
you'd been gone.

1080
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:10,038
You're out of your mind!

1081
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:13,789
I didn't even go through Los Angeles
until 6:25am, remember?

1082
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:16,195
I made a call to Helen
and left a message.

1083
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:20,074
Sure, on an answering service
that you knew would record the time.

1084
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:22,031
And you had to shout

1085
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:26,392
because you said you could hear all that
honking from the trucks on the freeway.

1086
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:31,196
But we got the sound lab on that, and you
know what they think caused that racket?

1087
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:33,709
- Crows.
- Crows?

1088
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:38,197
You know, those birds. Like the ones
we disturbed out with those cable guys.

1089
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:42,996
I didn't even arrive at Theresa's house
until seven. Those guys had already left.

1090
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:47,318
No, sir, you were already there before
they arrived. You had already killed her.

1091
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:49,795
Then when the cable guys came
you were trapped...

1092
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:53,037
you couldn't drive away
without being seen, so you had to wait.

1093
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:56,038
Now you can't get to Palm Springs
early enough,

1094
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:58,310
because you can't beat the traffic.

1095
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:00,908
- Wayne...
- He's making it up! Just relax.

1096
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:04,316
So now, Mr Jennings,
you do just like a juggler does...

1097
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:07,750
you drop one plan and you grab another.

1098
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:11,555
When the cable truck leaves,
you kill her with a different gun,

1099
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:15,229
knowing that if you ever got caught
you could always confess,

1100
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:19,990
and nobody would ever suspect that
you killed Ms Goren not once, but twice.

1101
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:24,272
- Oh, my God.
- That's a lie! You can't prove a word of it.

1102
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:28,188
I'm sorry, but that's the way it happened,
and I can prove every bit of it.

1103
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:31,551
Because I was just at the morgue
and I made a discovery.

1104
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:34,672
- Your sister didn't even dress herself.
- Didn't what?

1105
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:37,951
She didn't dress herself.
Whoever shot her dressed her.

1106
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:40,548
And that person had to be close to her...

1107
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:44,753
close enough to know that she would be
getting on a plane and wearing slacks.

1108
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:47,599
Well, Mavis knew, Lieutenant.
And I knew.

1109
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:51,474
Oh, it couldn't have been a woman,
because that person made a big mistake,

1110
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:54,160
the kind of mistake
that only a man would make.

1111
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:56,635
- You're crazy.
- Shut up.

1112
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:01,479
- What possible mistake?
- Here, I'll show you.

1113
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:04,273
- All right.
- This is how we found her.

1114
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:07,710
In her underwear and bathrobe
with her right thigh exposed.

1115
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:12,914
- Yes, I've seen that.
- Do you see that speck on her right hip?

1116
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:14,509
Just barely.

1117
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:18,076
It's been bothering me for two days.
It just didn't seem right.

1118
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:22,637
- Give me that!
- But it's very small, so I had it blown up.

1119
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:26,552
Now you can tell what it really is.

1120
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:31,428
Well, it's just a label
sticking out from under a waistband.

1121
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:33,551
A label. How ridiculous can you get?!

1122
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:38,117
Well, Mr Jennings, I guess nobody knows
everything about a woman, not even you.

1123
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:40,595
Let me see that again.

1124
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:50,430
You bastard!

1125
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:54,235
I'll kill you! I will kill you!
I will kill you!

1126
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:57,796
You killed her!

1127
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:04,076
All right, book him.
Suspicion of murder.

1128
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:20,673
Er, ma'am? Your maid is here,
she's waiting outside,

1129
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:24,475
and we'll drive you home
in one of our cars.

1130
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:27,469
Thank you, Lieutenant.

1131
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:35,078
Columbo, I don't understand.

1132
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:39,113
What the hell
is wrong with this damn picture?

1133
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:43,711
Well, here, let me show you
on these panties. Hold this up.

1134
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:50,029
Oh, well, this is Vanity Fair, but the label's
on the left side - where they usually are.

1135
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:54,790
American-made panties always used
to be on the left - my wife told me that.

1136
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:59,550
But Ms Goren's panties were Maidenform.
I saw them in the drawer.

1137
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:04,549
That's what my wife wears. And
Maidenform panties are always on the left.

1138
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:08,275
The panties I just saw in the morgue,
left side.

1139
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:13,679
But in the photograph there of the body,
that label is on the right side.

1140
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:21,309
So how did the label get from over here
all the way around to over there?

1141
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:24,070
Well, there's only one answer.

1142
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:26,998
The panties were put on backwards.

1143
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:32,035
And you don't think she would
do a thing like that herself, do you?

1144
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:35,877
Ahem.
