1
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,792
I need to talk to that motherfucker!
You hear me?

2
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:26,304
I want to talk to that fucker right now!

3
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,704
I want that motherfucker!

4
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,481
<i>You find that bastard now,
or I am gonna...</i>

5
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:48,288
<i>I'm gonna shoot my whore wife,
and I'm gonna shoot the boy!</i>

6
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:50,761
Joe, just relax.

7
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,094
Relax. We're looking
for your wife's boyfriend,

8
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,225
<i>- and I'm gonna find him, all right?
- You want to help me?</i>

9
00:03:55,301 --> 00:04:00,238
<i>Which one do I shoot first? Do I shoot
the whore, or do I shoot the whore's boy?</i>

10
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:01,933
<i>Huh? You help me choose!</i>

11
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:05,944
No, no, Joe,
nobody wants to hear gunshots in there.

12
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:08,776
You scare us all out here.

13
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:10,907
Now look.
I've been trying to help you all day.

14
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13,782
All right. You want me to help you,
you gotta help me.

15
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,684
<i>You don't know what it's like, man.</i>

16
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,245
<i>You do not know what it's like.</i>

17
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:20,315
<i>You do not know what I've been through.
You don't know what I'm going through.</i>

18
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:22,384
<i>You don't think I got the balls, do you?</i>

19
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:25,022
I know you got the balls, Joe.

20
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:29,797
<i>- No, you don't think I'm gonna do it.
- Joe, you got the gun.</i>

21
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:32,167
You can do whatever you want.

22
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:40,977
<i>I feel so tired, man.
When in Christ am I gonna sleep?</i>

23
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:45,507
I know you're tired, Joe.
You've been up all night.

24
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:48,076
Come on. Let me come down there.

25
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:50,213
<i>- What do you say?
- No! No, no!</i>

26
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,588
<i>Fuck you!</i>

27
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,443
You all right?

28
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,311
I hate this fucking guy.

29
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:18,577
Jeff, I'm leaning toward an entry.

30
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:23,350
We know the boy's in his room. If we move
now, we got a 100% chance of saving him.

31
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:26,654
- We're giving up on the mom?
- She's 20% at best.

32
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:29,854
Jeff, we gotta move on the boy.
It's the only choice.

33
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:33,695
- This one's getting away from him.
- Shrink-wrap, don't talk like I'm not here.

34
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:36,530
- We've been here for 16 hours.
- Fucking new guy.

35
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:39,127
Everybody calm down.
We're all tired.

36
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:42,106
I'd just steer Joe away from the subject
of choice. Choosing represents...

37
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,006
Tell me something I don't fucking know.

38
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,045
Wait, wait.

39
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:47,773
- I hear crying.
- The boy's awake.

40
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,611
We've gotta keep the boy in his bedroom.

41
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:53,174
<i>Shut up, Sean. Shut up!</i>

42
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,160
Hey, Joe. It's me, Jeff. I'm back on.

43
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,389
Listen, let Sean's mom
take care of him, all right?

44
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,864
<i>He's such a little shit, you know?
He's a little shit.</i>

45
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:09,959
<i>He's probably hungry,
'cause he wakes up and he just whines...</i>

46
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,402
<i>- Tell you what. Let me do you a favor.
... till that bitch feeds him.</i>

47
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:15,464
Find out what Sean likes to eat,
and I'll send it in.

48
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,203
Him and his mom can eat in the bedroom
while me and you fix this thing.

49
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:20,006
<i>- What do you say?
- Sean!</i>

50
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:24,106
<i>The cops want to know
what you want to eat, so get in here.</i>

51
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:27,949
<i>- The boy's moving from his bedroom.
- Get in here!</i>

52
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,352
Our guys put him at 80%.

53
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:34,389
60.

54
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,329
30.

55
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,592
<i>Hello?</i>

56
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:40,893
Sean.

57
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:44,130
<i>Hey, this is Jeff Talley.</i>

58
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:48,196
<i>Son, I need you to move back
to your bedroom, OK? Right now.</i>

59
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:49,969
<i>- Mr. Talley?
- Yes?</i>

60
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:52,510
Are you gonna save us?

61
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:56,145
Yeah, Sean. I'm gonna save you.

62
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,961
Now I know why you couldn't choose.

63
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:13,658
<i>It's because God
decided everything already.</i>

64
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,963
<i>Me and the whore are gonna go to hell.</i>

65
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:22,304
<i>- No, Joe. Just... Look, relax. Just relax.
- But my boy's gonna go to heaven.</i>

66
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:25,105
<i>I'm sorry, Jeff.</i>

67
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:27,271
<i>Joe, listen.</i>

68
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,375
Come on, Joe. Pick it up. Pick it up.

69
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,786
<i>- I hear ringing.
- Pick it up.</i>

70
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,916
<i>- It's just ringing.
- Pick it up, Joe.</i>

71
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:42,426
Jeff? He's saying something.

72
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:44,258
<i>- We got movement!
- Fuck!</i>

73
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,854
<i>- Where's your shot?
- We lost the shot.</i>

74
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,127
- Where do you want it?
- Side one, opening two.

75
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:51,034
<i>- I'll put him there.
- O my God, at the end of this day,</i>

76
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:55,631
<i>I'm heartily thankful
for all the graces I've received.</i>

77
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,934
<i>I'm so sorry for all the sins
I've committed against you.</i>

78
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:02,537
<i>Please forgive me, O God.</i>

79
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:07,315
<i>And graciously protect me
at the end of this night.</i>

80
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:11,789
<i>Blessed Virgin Mary, my heavenly mother,
please take me under your protection.</i>

81
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,485
<i>Joe! Hey, it's me, Jeff...</i>

82
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:16,119
<i>And St. Joseph.</i>

83
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:17,423
I'm outside your house!

84
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,328
<i>Saints of God, please pray for me.</i>

85
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:21,525
Just come to the window
and talk to me! Come on!

86
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:25,059
<i>- Amen.
- It's me, Jeff! Just come on!</i>

87
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:30,131
Joe, only God has the right to decide
who lives and who dies!

88
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,302
And he hasn't decided!

89
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,107
Joe! It doesn't have to end now!
I know you can hear me!

90
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,015
Joe, just come to the window
and talk to me!

91
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,953
Come on, pray with me.
I'll pray with you. Come on.

92
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:46,185
Come on. Just shoot me. Shoot me.

93
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:50,195
Come on, I'm right here. Just come to
the window. Come on, I know this prayer.

94
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:51,890
St. Joseph, dear God...

95
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:54,595
<i>Joe!</i>

96
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:24,786
Fuck.

97
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,257
Sean?

98
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,393
Sean?

99
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:36,301
Medic!

100
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:05,168
<i>Everybody stand down.
Get the EMTs.</i>

101
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:01,591
<i>'Cause it's not fair.
My life sucks since Dad moved up here.</i>

102
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,060
<i>We've all had
to make adjustments.</i>

103
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,221
It's just as hard on your father.

104
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:07,697
<i>Oh, bullshit, Mom. He loves it here.
He thinks Bristo Camino's nice.</i>

105
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,098
<i>Can we talk about this in the car?</i>

106
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,659
<i>No, Mom.
Why can't you tell him to come back to LA?</i>

107
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:13,329
<i>His job is here, Amanda.</i>

108
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,431
His home is here,
and when we visit, it's our home too.

109
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,306
<i>It's not my home
and it'll never be my home!</i>

110
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:21,369
Mom, don't you get it?
I fucking hate it here!

111
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:24,712
- Don't swear, and keep your voice down.
- What about me?

112
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:26,775
Bathroom's free.

113
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,312
<i>Why don't you guys
just get divorced?</i>

114
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,381
Freezie, come on.

115
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:46,071
It's OK. I'm not finished with it yet.

116
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,607
Sorry for all the shouting.

117
00:11:56,682 --> 00:12:00,516
Well... She had to get me to hear her
somehow, didn't she?

118
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:03,384
This is getting really, really hard,
you know?

119
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:04,980
I just wish you would talk to me.

120
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,389
How am I not talking to you?
I'm talking to you right now.

121
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,984
It would be nice
to know what you're thinking.

122
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:12,724
I'm thinking
that I'm a half-hour late for work.

123
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:18,202
Well, at least explain again
to your daughter why you took this job.

124
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,899
See you next weekend.

125
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,050
Hey.

126
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:43,753
Look, I don't know
what pisses you off more.

127
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:46,764
Me or my Tater-Tot casserole.

128
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,068
Amanda.

129
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,661
Amanda.

130
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,735
<i>Aman...</i>

131
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,180
This yours?

132
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,451
Dennis.

133
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:22,193
Smooth.

134
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:24,099
- Hey, that's, like, a $200 ticket.
- Shut up.

135
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,468
- You got $200? Huh?
- Shut up, Kevin.

136
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,805
Green light.

137
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,191
<i>If you have four dollars, you can't
give him seven. So you have to borrow.</i>

138
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:55,597
<i>Yeah, but... so you're...
If you're studying borrowing,</i>

139
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,865
you have to know
exactly how much you're borrowing.

140
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:00,769
OK. Bye.

141
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,740
- Can I go hang at the Plaza tonight?
- The Plaza?

142
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:05,834
- Yeah, just friends. It might be a movie.
- Can we have Mr. Kim's tonight?

143
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:08,004
- Can you wait?
- Oh, Mr. Kim we have on speed dial.

144
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,877
- I'm hungry.
- I'm talking.

145
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:14,750
I'm ordering. Hello, yes. I wanted to
put in an order, please, to pick up.

146
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,118
<i>- What about homework?
- Done.</i>

147
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,851
<i>Ha. I almost believe that.</i>

148
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:21,722
Yeah. We'd like to order...

149
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,887
Well, what would we like to order?

150
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:26,363
<i>Kev, do the Dew. In super size.</i>

151
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,093
<i>Hey, why do I always gotta go?</i>

152
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:31,193
If I'm buying, you're flying.
Get out of the truck.

153
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,637
- You should listen to your brother.
- Give me some money then.

154
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,698
It's in the box.

155
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,777
What's that for? Dennis?

156
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:46,647
Check the car. Check the car, Mars.

157
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:01,228
Hey, I know her.

158
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,031
I mean... I don't know her.
I've seen her around.

159
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:08,198
- You know where she lives?
- No.

160
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,420
Oh, you think it's funny?

161
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:30,428
Rich bitch driving in her daddy's Escalade.

162
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:32,157
Fuck you.

163
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,374
- Hello, Louise.
- Afternoon, Chief.

164
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,145
Who's in the field?

165
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:57,154
Ruiz and Kovaks are working
a TC over on Monte Verde.

166
00:15:57,222 --> 00:16:01,283
Two units, one fender bender.
Hope she's 18.

167
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,158
- Afternoon, Chief.
- Bill.

168
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:06,629
Mikey. Very dynamic wheels.

169
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,189
- Casual Monday?
- Well, Chief, I...

170
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,064
How do you expect
to be taken seriously as a cop

171
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,126
if you're gonna wear
sneakers to work, kid?

172
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:15,867
- I'm sorry, Chief. It won't happen again.
- That's what you said on Casual Sunday.

173
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:18,637
- It was the play-offs.
- Yeah.

174
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:22,603
What do you say we rename today
"Low-crime Monday"?

175
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:25,946
- Followed by what?
- Low-crime Tuesday.

176
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:28,009
That's right.

177
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,913
Low-crime Tuesday.

178
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:40,859
<i>Yes, I would say
Brenda's looking very good.</i>

179
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:43,087
Fine. Couple of minutes.

180
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:44,322
Daddy?

181
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:48,765
Uh, can you give me just a second?
My son just walked in.

182
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,995
What's this attached to my ear?

183
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,061
- A phone.
- Why is it attached to my ear?

184
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:56,505
- 'Cause you're talking on it?
- Which means you are...

185
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,669
- Interrupting your conversation?
- That's my genius.

186
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,942
OK, Mr. Genius. What I'd like is
all your homework done, on my desk,

187
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:05,074
before any more television. Sound good?

188
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,345
- God...
- I know.

189
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,411
How about getting
the doors there for me, champ?

190
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:13,151
- Appreciate it. One, and then...
- The other.

191
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,216
Yeah. Thanks, champ.

192
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:22,791
<i>OK. I am ready
to loan you Heaven Can Wait.</i>

193
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:27,799
What time would you like me to drop it?

194
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:29,899
OK.

195
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,473
Done.

196
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:54,093
I like it.

197
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:57,033
Let's just go to the movies.

198
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,528
We're gonna go to the movies.

199
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:02,233
<i>- But first we're gonna take daddy's car.
- No, man.</i>

200
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:07,040
Dennis, this is way worse
than any shit you've done before.

201
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:15,582
Stay in the truck, OK?

202
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,418
Dad, you're such a dinosaur!

203
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,986
All right. All I'm saying
is that there are men out there.

204
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:28,055
Men. Not the boys I go to school with.

205
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:30,363
Right. Men. OK?

206
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:36,305
Men see this sort of outfit
as a sexual invitation. That's all I'm saying.

207
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,251
- Looking for something?
- Empty.

208
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:57,989
Ooh, how'd that happen?

209
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:02,090
Look, how's this?
If I change what I'm wearing,

210
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:06,604
- will you give me $40 for tonight?
- If that doesn't remind me of your mother.

211
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:09,004
How about you change
what you're wearing,

212
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:12,441
then we talk about the $40 afterwards, OK?

213
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,239
Hey. Hey.

214
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,243
Door.

215
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,514
Say it again, rich bitch. Huh?

216
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,820
Say "Fuck you".

217
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:28,876
Tommy?

218
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,114
- Tommy, what...
- Hey, don't move.

219
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:35,716
- No. No.
- Don't move, man.

220
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:39,457
- What do you want?
- Who else is in the house?

221
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:41,829
Nobody.

222
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,492
<i>Daddy!</i>

223
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:44,796
<i>- Tommy...
- Where's mommy?</i>

224
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,100
Huh? Where's mommy?

225
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:48,935
<i>My wife's dead.</i>

226
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:50,634
Mars, the door.

227
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:11,156
You really should listen to your brother.

228
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,792
- Shit!
- What are you doing?

229
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:16,800
I told you to stay in the fucking truck.

230
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:20,770
- Dennis, man, you can't do this.
- I told you, don't use my fucking name.

231
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,969
- Where are the keys?
- Keys?

232
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:27,944
- Where are the fucking car keys?
- In my office.

233
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,412
Office. Go. Come on, let's go.

234
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:31,711
All right.
It's gonna be OK.

235
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,675
I like your shirt.

236
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:38,518
<i>By the way,
Carol's answering a silent alarm.</i>

237
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:42,752
Says there's a suspicious vehicle out front.

238
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:46,559
All right. Let's get her some backup.
See who's in the area.

239
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:51,031
Bristo 23 and 29er, 15 requesting backup.

240
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:55,531
<i>Ruiz, Kovaks, are you out there?</i>

241
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:59,771
<i>Bristo 23 and 29er,
15 requesting backup.</i>

242
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:03,278
<i>Bristo 23 and 29er,
15 requesting backup.</i>

243
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:06,476
Louise, what's the address on that alarm?
I'm gonna go check it out myself.

244
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:09,042
- Daddy, just give them the keys.
- I'm gonna give them the keys, honey.

245
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,349
<i>I just need to be certain...</i>

246
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:13,482
- What is that? What the fuck is that?
- The front gate.

247
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,458
- It's a cop. Dennis, it's a cop.
- Shit!

248
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:19,054
<i>- It's OK. I know her. Just be cool.
- Shit, shit, shit, shit!</i>

249
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:21,429
- It's OK. I can just...
- Shut the fuck up!

250
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,027
Calm down, OK? I can talk
to the police officer from here using that.

251
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:28,800
<i>I can tell her that everything's fine.
Then she'll go, and then you can go.</i>

252
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:41,849
<i>Hello?</i>

253
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,323
<i>Afternoon. This is Officer Flores
with the Bristo Camino Police Department.</i>

254
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:49,360
<i>We're answering a silent alarm.
Is everything OK in there?</i>

255
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,659
<i>I'm sorry. We must have
accidentally tripped the alarm.</i>

256
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,393
I understand, sir.
These things happen all the time.

257
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:57,958
But there's an abandoned
pickup truck on your street.

258
00:23:58,036 --> 00:23:59,333
Have you seen who it might belong to?

259
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:03,101
<i>Oh, no, it's not abandoned. There's
a guy here fixing the airconditioning.</i>

260
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:05,040
<i>I'm sure everything's OK.</i>

261
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,975
<i>Could you come outside, please?</i>

262
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:10,947
<i>- Say something.
- Officer, my son's got a fever.</i>

263
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:13,985
<i>I've got the pediatrician on hold. Do you
really need me to come down there?</i>

264
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:18,648
<i>- 15, please respond.
- Bristo base, this is 15. Come back.</i>

265
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:22,159
<i>Carol, be advised
there's a felony want on that red pickup.</i>

266
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:26,755
<i>The vehicle's suspected of being involved
in a carjacking last week in Valencia...</i>

267
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:46,446
Mars! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fucking shit!

268
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:02,294
<i>Shit!</i>

269
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:07,667
Code three!
I'm taking fire. I'm taking fire!

270
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:10,105
Get on the fucking couch!
I gotta fucking think, man.

271
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,803
- Fuck! Shit.
- Dennis, in my desk I have contacts

272
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:15,176
for lawyers and judges.

273
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:18,808
- I can help you get out of this, Dennis.
- Fuck! Don't say my fucking name!

274
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:21,546
<i>- No! No!
- Dennis! Dennis! Dennis!</i>

275
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,951
Stop it!

276
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:26,889
Daddy, no! Daddy, wake up!

277
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:28,016
Fuck you.

278
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:33,958
<i>Flores is down. Flores is down!</i>

279
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,398
Heads down, heads down.
I'm coming up to...

280
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:46,001
- Hector, you all right?
- Jesus!

281
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:52,574
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?

282
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,949
They ran your truck, dawg.
They know we've been jacking cars.

283
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,318
<i>- Shit.
- Attention, you in the house.</i>

284
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:01,223
<i>This is Chief Talley
of the Bristo Camino Police Department.</i>

285
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:05,127
I'm gonna bring my car closer
so I can evacuate the injured officer.

286
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:09,462
I am not coming in the house.
I repeat: I am not coming in the house.

287
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:11,229
Do not shoot me.

288
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,396
<i>Do not shoot at me.</i>

289
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:21,509
Carol, come on. Give me your hand.

290
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,047
Hang on. Come on.

291
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:25,082
Come on.

292
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:30,078
Just hang on. Hang on.

293
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,191
<i>Hey.</i>

294
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:25,066
Pull yourself together.
Put this in the back of one of the cars.

295
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,134
Go on.

296
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:37,310
<i>ETA on the sheriff is 15 minutes.</i>

297
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:42,122
<i>Deputy in charge is Captain Shoemaker,
negotiator is Wil Bechler.</i>

298
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:43,319
<i>Thanks, Louise.</i>

299
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:46,091
Truck's registered
to a Mary Anne Kelly of Agua Dulce.

300
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,756
We're still trying to track her down.

301
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:51,666
But a neighbor told us she lives with
her two teenage boys, Dennis and Kevin.

302
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:56,139
And the neighbor also told us
that Dennis has some juvenile history.

303
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:00,171
<i>You're gonna go to jail.</i>

304
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:02,042
<i>- You're all gonna go to jail.
- Enough!</i>

305
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:03,546
- Why won't you just leave us alone?
- Tie 'em up.

306
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:06,209
- Tie 'em up with what?
- I don't know. Just figure something out.

307
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:07,945
Tie 'em up. Go upstairs. Let's go.

308
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,010
I'm not leaving my father.

309
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:15,116
I'm gonna take care of him. I'm gonna get
some ice for his head, maybe a pillow.

310
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:18,026
- It's OK.
- Come on, let's go.

311
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:20,257
<i>Let's go.</i>

312
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,704
Yeah?

313
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:39,580
<i>Since you're answering the phone,
I'm going to assume this is Dennis.</i>

314
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:43,650
I'll take that as a yes.

315
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:47,351
This is Jeff Talley, Dennis.
I'm with the local police.

316
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:49,325
You the man in charge in there?

317
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:52,158
Yeah. I'm in charge.

318
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,561
<i>All right.</i>

319
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:56,031
Then you can tell me who shot my cop.

320
00:28:56,101 --> 00:29:00,902
- Was it you, or Kevin?
- No... no, don't put that on us.

321
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:04,341
I want to talk to Mr. Smith for a minute.

322
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,969
<i>I want to hear from him
that everything's OK inside the house.</i>

323
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:10,742
Fuck you. I'm running this shit.

324
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:12,908
<i>- You talk to me.
- That's right, Dennis.</i>

325
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:15,248
<i>You are running this shit.</i>

326
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,017
<i>Tell me you're the man in charge, that'll
be your responsibility. You understand?</i>

327
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:22,253
<i>Fuck you.
Don't try and play me.</i>

328
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:24,693
<i>You get us a helicopter
to fly us out of this shit.</i>

329
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,424
I'm just a local paper-pusher, Dennis.

330
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:29,194
<i>Get me a fucking helicopter
before I start shooting people.</i>

331
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,599
Be cool, Dennis. Be cool.

332
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,872
Nobody wants to hear guns go off in there.

333
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:40,400
You tell me you didn't shoot my cop?
All right. I believe you.

334
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:43,106
But nobody's gonna be able to help you
if you start hurting people in there.

335
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:46,742
<i>- You understand?
- Just get me what I want.</i>

336
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:50,151
- I'm not the guy, Dennis.
- Then get me the guy!

337
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:59,993
<i>- Louise, come back.
- Go, Chief.</i>

338
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:03,522
Confirmed the entire Smith family
is inside the house,

339
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:06,035
along with two suspects, possibly a third.

340
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:19,706
You want a hit?

341
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:26,788
OK.

342
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,938
- Can't get out this way.
- We can't get out this way, either.

343
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,769
- Hey, Dennis. Dennis.
- What?

344
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,036
- Dennis.
- What?

345
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:47,634
That cop... Mars just started shooting.

346
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:49,577
You know what, Kevin? Mars had a reason.

347
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:50,511
- Had a reason?
- Yeah.

348
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:54,484
Dennis, you've known that guy,
like, three weeks, and he just shot a cop.

349
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:56,179
Whose fault
do you think that was, Kevin? Huh?

350
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:57,312
- He shot a cop.
- Huh?

351
00:30:57,388 --> 00:31:00,755
Maybe you should've stayed in the truck.
If you'd listened, you could've warned us.

352
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:06,491
You could've lied to the cop. Done
something other than fucking this shit up.

353
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:13,534
There's no way out up here.

354
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:15,937
<i>Hey, you guys
gotta come see this shit.</i>

355
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:19,307
Kitchen. Driveway.

356
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:22,073
And office right there.

357
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:27,307
Holy shit.

358
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:36,890
<i>...apparently
a hostage situation is unfolding.</i>

359
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:41,295
<i>We have no further information,
other than the pictures that you see here.</i>

360
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,475
Fuckin' rich people.

361
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,625
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

362
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:21,069
This is bad. No, this is bad!

363
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:36,810
Fuckin' rich people.

364
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:49,823
<i>Put it back.</i>

365
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,665
- Claustrophobic?
- Try fuckedophobic.

366
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:57,207
Mars. Mars, Kevin.

367
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:08,351
Fucking check this out.

368
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:54,827
<i>Hi. This is Walter Smith. You've reached
my voice mail. Please leave a message.</i>

369
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:05,672
We have a problem.
I can't get to the accountant.

370
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:08,041
I know. I'm watching it on TV.

371
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:11,673
We must get control of this situation.
We have nine hours until the hand-off.

372
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:13,808
<i>Bristo Camino
has a very small police department,</i>

373
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:17,150
<i>so we have requested the assistance
of Ventura County Sheriff's Department,</i>

374
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,552
<i>who will be here shortly.</i>

375
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:20,147
<i>Chief, we understand the dead officer...</i>

376
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,283
- Would you stop it?
- We need to help Daddy.

377
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,818
Shut up. Watch the TV.
That's the police, OK? They're gonna help.

378
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,728
- We gotta cut the tape.
- Shut up.

379
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:31,667
Roll together, OK? Off the bed. Then, like,
maybe we can get what's under the bed.

380
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:35,069
- Under my bed? What's under my bed?
- Your bong. We can break it.

381
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,198
What? You've been sneaking in my room?

382
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:45,407
- Come on, hurry. Faster. You gotta do it.
- I'm trying.

383
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:46,916
<i>Wait, shh.</i>

384
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:49,077
<i>Christ. What are you guys doing?
You didn't hear that?</i>

385
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:50,586
All right, come on. Fight with me now.

386
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:53,123
<i>- Stop screaming, you little gerbil...
- Help! Help!</i>

387
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:56,490
Jesus Christ. You're kidding me.
Are you kidding me?

388
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:59,655
The kid... Cut him, yeah. Cut him.
The kid weighs, like, 30 pounds.

389
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:02,961
Are you kidding me? Tie him up, OK?
Tie him up in his own room.

390
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:05,867
Please try doing it right, OK?
Please do it right.

391
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,097
- You get the girl.
- It'll be OK!

392
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:10,072
Do it right without dickin' it up.

393
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:15,702
What about my brother?

394
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,772
Don't worry about him.

395
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,514
You cold?

396
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:24,020
No.

397
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,990
I'm Marshall.

398
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:29,219
What's your name?

399
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,818
Jennifer.

400
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:34,194
Please.

401
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:45,767
Please.

402
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,734
<i>...the situation is undercontrol...</i>

403
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:26,216
"Jeff Talley, Chief of Police".

404
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:53,998
- Asked for the helicopter yet?
- Right from the jump.

405
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:56,437
Might want to get a minister
or a priest up here.

406
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:58,839
Like riding a bike, isn't it?

407
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,375
- Want to talk to him?
- Robby!

408
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:04,937
Got me that dedicated line yet?

409
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:08,975
You miss LA?

410
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:12,655
<i>Five minutes,
scout team, five minutes.</i>

411
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:18,184
- Speed dial one?
- Yeah.

412
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:27,369
<i>- Yeah?
- Dennis, this is Jeff Talley.</i>

413
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:31,568
I'm gonna introduce you to Wil Bechler
from the Sheriff's Department.

414
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,837
Are you ready to talk to him?

415
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:36,436
<i>Is he the guy?</i>

416
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:40,177
Yeah, Dennis. This is the guy.

417
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:41,946
Hang on.

418
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:44,681
Good luck. I'll see you around.

419
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:51,756
Captain Shoemaker? Captain?

420
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,319
- Thank you for coming up.
- Thanks, Jeff.

421
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:56,662
- Anything you need, give me a call.
- Got it.

422
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:38,001
<i>...apparent hostage situation is unfolding.</i>

423
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:42,603
<i>Well, Jim, details are still a bit incomplete
right now, but here's what we know so far.</i>

424
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,912
<i>Earlier today, a police officer
was shot and killed while in...</i>

425
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:49,214
Hey. How you doing? It's me.

426
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:52,016
You guys almost home?

427
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:54,751
<i>Actually, we're still at your place.</i>

428
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:58,158
After you left, Amanda and I,
we had another fight.

429
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:02,757
<i>She turned on the TV.
We've been watching it all.</i>

430
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:05,199
<i>Well...</i>

431
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:07,760
I turned it over to County,
so I'm not there anymore.

432
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:11,797
Look, I know you're busy,
but can you stop by for a little bit?

433
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:14,334
I think I can, yeah.

434
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:18,311
I have to go by Carol's.

435
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:20,543
She had a kid.

436
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:23,086
<i>It's not your fault she's dead, Jeff.</i>

437
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:25,145
<i>You know?</i>

438
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:28,515
<i>It's not your fault.</i>

439
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,749
Yeah.

440
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:40,035
<i>- So, what was the argument about?
- Oh, you know. What it's always about.</i>

441
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,698
She's afraid we're gonna get divorced.

442
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,764
<i>What do you think, Jane?</i>

443
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,241
<i>You think we're gonna get divorced?</i>

444
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:50,941
<i>- No.
- Good. Me neither.</i>

445
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:56,509
<i>- So, I'll see you in a minute.
- OK.</i>

446
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:58,452
<i>- Say hi to Amanda.
- I will.</i>

447
00:40:58,522 --> 00:41:00,513
<i>- OK.
- I love you.</i>

448
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:12,258
Whoo!

449
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,841
<i>Drive.</i>

450
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:06,542
I know you're scared, but as long as
you don't do anything stupid,

451
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:10,178
we're not gonna hurt you.
Do you understand?

452
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:13,752
What do you want?

453
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:18,921
I want you to put your hands
on the roof of the car.

454
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:34,308
Pardon me.

455
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:43,419
Now, would you mind putting your left
hand through the steering wheel, please?

456
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:50,884
Now bring me the right.

457
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,952
Good.

458
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:58,034
Good.

459
00:43:58,102 --> 00:44:01,196
Now the guy behind you
is gonna take hold of you.

460
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:05,833
Don't struggle. It's for your own good.
Please.

461
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:14,676
Eyes in the rearview mirror. Now.

462
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:20,215
<i>- Daddy!
- Jane! Amanda!</i>

463
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:38,571
I know. I know, I know.

464
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:42,204
But at least they're still alive.

465
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:46,511
From this point on,
you control what happens to them.

466
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:50,977
Can we let you go?

467
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:54,250
Can you be calm?

468
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:01,921
Good. Good.

469
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:12,269
Now, listen to me. I want you
to go back to Walter Smith's house.

470
00:45:12,342 --> 00:45:17,837
There's a DVD inside Walter Smith's
house that belongs to me.

471
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:19,542
I'm no longer in command.

472
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:24,849
You are going to reassume command
until my people arrive to finish the job.

473
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:28,688
You're not gonna let anyone
go into the house or anything come out.

474
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:31,284
Are you with me so far?

475
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:33,352
How am I gonna do that?

476
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:39,334
You... are the famous Jeff Talley.

477
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:44,607
Ten years SWAT,
seven years prime hostage negotiator.

478
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:46,666
You'll figure it out.

479
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:55,679
When this white phone rings,
it'll be me with further instructions.

480
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:59,883
If you deviate from the plan one little bit,

481
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:02,084
I will kill your wife.

482
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,493
And then I will kill your child.

483
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:11,294
But when I have what I want,
you get your family back.

484
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:17,437
Here.

485
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:21,774
Now, you wait until our van is gone
before you uncuff yourself.

486
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:24,336
Let's bring this home, Talley.

487
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:27,710
<i>- Yeah?
- We have a boy on the line.</i>

488
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:30,338
<i>And he says he's Tommy Smith.</i>

489
00:47:30,414 --> 00:47:32,245
I was gonna turn him over to the Sheriff's,

490
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:35,979
but he says he saw you on TV
and he wants to speak with you.

491
00:47:36,053 --> 00:47:38,886
<i>- All right, Louise. Put him on.
- Hold on.</i>

492
00:47:38,956 --> 00:47:42,392
<i>- You're the man on TV?
- Yes, Tommy, this is the man on TV.</i>

493
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:44,450
<i>The guy called Dennis hit my dad,
and now he's...</i>

494
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:47,156
Slow down, slow down, slow down.
Slow down, Tommy. Slow down.

495
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:49,062
<i>I'm really, really scared,
and you gotta help us.</i>

496
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:51,157
Slow down and take it easy.

497
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:53,932
Was your dad shot?

498
00:47:54,004 --> 00:47:56,734
<i>Dennis hit him
a bunch of times with his gun.</i>

499
00:47:56,807 --> 00:47:58,672
<i>- He hit my dad.
- Tommy. Tommy. Tommy!</i>

500
00:47:58,742 --> 00:48:01,643
<i>- He needs a doctor.
- Try and talk quietly, OK?</i>

501
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,339
<i>- Just take it easy.
- OK.</i>

502
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:05,973
All right.
Are you in a safe place?

503
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:09,450
<i>I'm in my bedroom.
They think I'm tied up, but I got free.</i>

504
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:13,580
Wait, Tommy.
How do you know they can't hear you?

505
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:17,115
<i>'Cause I can see them
on the security channel.</i>

506
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:19,219
<i>Tell me everything you can see on the TV.</i>

507
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:21,955
I see Dennis.

508
00:48:22,032 --> 00:48:24,296
I see Kevin.

509
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:26,063
I see trees.

510
00:48:26,136 --> 00:48:28,604
<i>I see army men.</i>

511
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:32,598
I see... the Mars guy...

512
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:34,769
<i>Wait, Tommy.</i>

513
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:39,674
Tell me about Mars.

514
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,150
- Captain Shoemaker?
- Get me an aerial shot ASAP.

515
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:43,208
This is Shoemaker.

516
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:45,084
<i>They're watching you
on the outside cameras.</i>

517
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:45,883
<i>Chief Talley?</i>

518
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:48,049
The suspects inside the house
are watching you.

519
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:50,821
<i>- They're watching every move you make.
- Where did you get this information?</i>

520
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:54,295
If I were you I'd be thinking about
what to do with that information.

521
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:01,803
Mikey. Yeah, it's me. Listen to me.

522
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,798
Yeah, Chief.

523
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:07,241
Yeah, the snipers are shifting positions.

524
00:49:07,744 --> 00:49:10,304
<i>Louise? Louise, come back.</i>

525
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,780
<i>- Come on, Louise. Where's that patch?
- I'm locked out.</i>

526
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:14,976
It's a dedicated line, Chief.
They won't let me cut in.

527
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:17,646
What about Walter Smith's cell phone?
Did you get that?

528
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:19,882
<i>Uh... yes. Yes, I got it.</i>

529
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:23,415
<i>- OK, go.
- It's 805-459...</i>

530
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:27,589
Dennis, you know what I'm hearing?
I'm hearing your dad's a real son of a bitch.

531
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:29,393
<i>No, we're fucking done, OK?</i>

532
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:32,663
All I want is my fucking helicopter
to fly me the fuck out of here.

533
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:33,998
You got that, fuckhead?

534
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:36,437
<i>Dennis, listen. I...</i>

535
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:44,811
<i>Hi. This is Walter Smith.
You've reached my voice mail.</i>

536
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:47,475
<i>- Shit.
- Please leave a message.</i>

537
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,849
Come on, Dennis. Pick it up. Come on.

538
00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:17,579
He keeps ringing.

539
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:38,860
<i>- Hello?
- Dennis, this is Jeff Talley.</i>

540
00:50:38,935 --> 00:50:42,063
Listen to me. Watch the security channel.

541
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:44,103
<i>Dennis, can you hear me?</i>

542
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:46,699
Yeah. I don't really know
what you're talking about.

543
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:48,506
<i>The hell you don't!
Shut up and listen to me!</i>

544
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:52,378
<i>Just watch the TV.
Just keep watching the outside cameras.</i>

545
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:54,041
<i>- Yeah, what am I supposed to be seeing?
- Shut up!</i>
