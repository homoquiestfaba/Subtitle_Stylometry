00:54:29,652 --> 00:54:32,722
Oh! There's your problem.

546
00:54:34,058 --> 00:54:36,961
How many miles you've
been riding like this?

547
00:54:36,994 --> 00:54:38,728
Hand me that set of 16s.

548
00:54:41,664 --> 00:54:43,666
Well, I started south out of
Basin, and picked

549
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,903
my daughter up at camp
in Central Wyoming.

550
00:54:46,804 --> 00:54:48,773
Starting from Montana, huh?

551
00:54:48,806 --> 00:54:52,009
I'm impressed
you made it this far.

552
00:54:52,043 --> 00:54:55,146
Okay, you're gonna have to
rebuild this thing entirely.

553
00:54:55,179 --> 00:54:58,049
I mean, I can clean it out a
bit, get you back on the road,

554
00:54:58,082 --> 00:55:01,052
but I'd take her easy out there
if I were you.

555
00:55:02,119 --> 00:55:03,954
I appreciate it.

556
00:55:03,988 --> 00:55:07,024
I couldn't just let you ride
out of here like this, you know.

557
00:55:07,058 --> 00:55:09,326
Fellow Montanan and all,
especially with that

00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,128
sweet little girl of
yours on the back.

559
00:55:13,364 --> 00:55:15,833
Help me here. Hold this for me.

00:55:18,402 --> 00:55:19,870
Uh-huh.

about the carb.

'em back on the road.

And how much longer
are you thinking?

579
00:56:40,885 --> 00:56:43,420
Well, we need to soak it a bit.

where are you guys staying?

00:56:52,062 --> 00:56:54,899
I was hoping to get as
far as Thompson Falls.

00:56:54,932 --> 00:56:58,735
Thompson Falls?
That's four hours.

586
00:56:58,769 --> 00:57:00,437
Well, we'll get a motel
or something.

We're not camping?

You know, there's not much
from here to there.

589
00:57:05,442 --> 00:57:07,278
I mean nothing decent anyways.

590

I just...

596
00:57:19,857 --> 00:57:22,359
Sounds like you guys could
use a good night's rest.

597
00:57:22,393 --> 00:57:23,928
No, thank you. But we should...

Dad, can't we just
leave real early in the morning?

a longer day tomorrow.

Hey.

611
00:57:59,897 --> 00:58:02,466
Hanna says she's a vegetarian,
so I thought

612
00:58:02,499 --> 00:58:04,501
I'd make a
nice little Primavera.

613
00:58:04,535 --> 00:58:06,870
That sounds great. Thanks.

who does that.

00:58:39,303 --> 00:58:43,874
So, Hanna, tell us more about
this camp?

628
00:58:43,907 --> 00:58:46,277
- It's an astronomy camp.
- Astronomy?

629
00:58:46,310 --> 00:58:49,246
Well, that's not your
typical summer camp.

630
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,882
I won an essay contest
and got invited.

631
00:58:51,915 --> 00:58:53,917
Roy: Well, that's very
impressive.

632
00:58:53,951 --> 00:58:56,520
Well, what did you learn about?

633
00:58:56,553 --> 00:58:58,455
I can show you something.

634
00:58:58,489 --> 00:58:59,957
Okay.

635
00:59:00,958 --> 00:59:02,259
- Outside.
- Oh.

636
00:59:02,293 --> 00:59:03,294
Ah. Sure.

637
00:59:03,327 --> 00:59:05,229
- I'll get my coat.
- Ya, I'll get this later.

638
00:59:07,064 --> 00:59:09,933
[instrumental music]

639
00:59:23,447 --> 00:59:28,185
Okay, so on any given night, you
can see almost 20 quadrillion

640
00:59:28,218 --> 00:59:30,087
miles away with the naked eye.

641
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:32,423
But that number is kind of hard
to make sense of,

642
00:59:32,456 --> 00:59:35,292
so we use light years as a more
manageable unit of distance.

643
00:59:36,627 --> 00:59:38,462
Okay, that...
everybody knows that.

644
00:59:38,495 --> 00:59:42,166
What's really cool to me
is what that actually means.

645
00:59:42,199 --> 00:59:45,102
Take the North Star
for example.

646
00:59:45,135 --> 00:59:46,970
Well, its real
name is Polaris.

647
00:59:49,206 --> 00:59:51,175
People think Polaris is
the nearest star

648
00:59:51,208 --> 00:59:54,278
after the sun
because it's light is so bright,

649
00:59:54,311 --> 00:59:55,612
but it's not even close.

650
00:59:55,646 --> 00:59:58,215
It might not even
break the top 100.

651
00:59:58,248 --> 01:00:01,618
It's actually 433 light years
away.

652
01:00:01,652 --> 01:00:04,621
Which means if we were somehow
standing on Polaris right now,

653
01:00:04,655 --> 01:00:08,258
we'd actually be looking at
earth 433 years in the past.

654
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:13,097
So like, 30 years
before the pilgrims

655
01:00:13,130 --> 01:00:14,898
landed on Plymouth Rock.

656
01:00:17,668 --> 01:00:19,970
I like looking up
and thinking about that.

657
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:24,975

It wasn't working, Hanna.
For any of us.

You could come back home now.

669

It doesn't work like that.

671
01:01:28,605 --> 01:01:30,574
You don't want me in your life.
You understand?

01:01:30,607 --> 01:01:32,075
This...

673
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:35,179
This isn't real.

01:01:35,212 --> 01:01:37,181
How do you know what I want?

675
01:01:45,122 --> 01:01:47,357
I'm gonna get you home
to your mom.

676
01:01:48,793 --> 01:01:50,461
Get some sleep.

677
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:03,607
Is she comfortable?

678
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,175
Yeah.

679
01:02:05,209 --> 01:02:07,744

in this bottle.

finish it off with me?

681
01:02:10,247 --> 01:02:11,415
Sure.

682

She's a good girl.

683
01:02:28,532 --> 01:02:30,167
Yeah, I know.

684
01:02:33,470 --> 01:02:36,406
So, have you always lived
here with your dad?

685
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:37,441
Nope.

686
01:02:37,474 --> 01:02:40,244
Believe it or not,
I used to live in New York.

687
01:02:41,245 --> 01:02:43,013
That was a lifetime ago.

688
01:02:44,381 --> 01:02:47,785
And then my mom passed,
my dad took it pretty hard.

689
01:02:47,819 --> 01:02:53,590
And I wasn't too tied down
back East, so I came on home.

690
01:02:53,624 --> 01:02:57,294
Wasn't planning on staying here,
but, you know, now Montana

691
01:02:57,327 --> 01:02:59,463
can have that effect on you,
you know.

692
01:03:03,801 --> 01:03:05,602
From what my mom shared,
and this,

693
01:03:05,636 --> 01:03:07,271
this was before I was born.

694
01:03:07,304 --> 01:03:11,608
My dad went through a real
rough patch, and it was

695
01:03:11,642 --> 01:03:15,379
about some accident, I don't
really know the details,

696
01:03:15,412 --> 01:03:17,548
he doesn't talk about it.

697
01:03:17,581 --> 01:03:21,552
He got really distant,
and angry.

698
01:03:21,585 --> 01:03:25,455
And that just got harder
and harder on her.

699
01:03:25,489 --> 01:03:29,259
She never said it, but I think
she was about to leave.

700
01:03:30,828 --> 01:03:35,499
So luckily, or not luckily,
his dad passed suddenly,

701
01:03:35,532 --> 01:03:39,570
and they came back
and they never left.

702
01:03:39,603 --> 01:03:42,339
And she always said
this place saved him.

703
01:03:48,846 --> 01:03:55,152
Look, I don't know your story,
Jack, and I don't wanna ask you.

704
01:03:55,185 --> 01:03:58,455
But whatever it is,
it's not too late.

705
01:03:59,590 --> 01:04:01,291
You know, that little
girl needs you.

I heard you never
picked up the truck.

I need to be with my daughter
a few more days.

getting your family time

to have a full crew here.

I appreciate the work.
