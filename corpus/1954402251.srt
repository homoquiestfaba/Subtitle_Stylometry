AND HE WAS GONE.

517
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:23,514
VANISHED.

518

NEVER DID SEE HIM AGAIN,
IN FACT.

519
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:27,885

IT'S PROBABLY THE COLDEST
TIME OF THE DAY.

570
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,482
WHEN THE SUN RISES
OVER THE MOUNTAINS,

571
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,984
PUSHES THE COLD AIR DOWN.

572
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,419
