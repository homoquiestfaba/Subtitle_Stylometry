1
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:11,654
There is no darkness without light,

2
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:15,750
and yet there is light
without darkness.

3
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:21,415
I have both within me.

4
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,384
Flyby to Ghost,

5
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,386
you're about 20 miles
out from target.

6
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,185
There are no bogies
visible from above.

7
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,308
Roger that, Flyby.

8
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,435
So tell me, is there any good
restaurants around here?

9
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:27,485
Nobody told me Movie
Star can't cook.

10
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:34,663
Yeah, that's a negative on
the restaurants, Ghost.

11
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:11,273
Ghost, this is Director Styles.

12
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,942
Reaper-1 is now online.

13
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,861
We're maintaining a safe and
invisible distance to target.

14
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,781
We're getting a good image of
what's going on down there.

15
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:21,284
Ready to bring Hellfire
down on your command.

16
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,539
Look, I'm sorry about
cutting your team.

17
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,791
This is a mission we
need to keep quiet.

18
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:31,260
You're operating as
a two-man team now.

19
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,845
Target name: Abu Alwaki Khan.

20
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:44,140
The ground-branch comedians
called him Abu Normal.

21
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:46,684
Your primary target
remains Abdul Normal.

22
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:49,478
We have new information
on the secondary target,

23
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,322
an arms dealer.

24
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,570
Hey, Ghost.

25
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,990
We gotta go.

26
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,492
Our secondary target is
a Chicom arms dealer,

27
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:08,123
an Islamic fundamentalist who
finances terrorist activities.

28
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,505
We go by call signs.

29
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,924
We never know a team
member's real name.

30
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,801
You're now five miles out, Ghost.

31
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,387
Switching to radio silence.
Over and out.

32
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:26,265
I don't feel good about
them splintering our team.

33
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,809
We a 12-man team, minimum of six.

34
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,520
We down to fucking two
'cause they had to go kill

35
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,857
some fucking high-value
target up in the north

36
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:37,026
50 minutes from here.
What the fuck is that?

37
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,612
Well, it's a small camp.

38
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:44,074
VICD confirmed target's
there, that right?

39
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,869
UAV followed him in there
about 45 minutes ago.

40
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,538
He's got a protection
detail of three shooters.

41
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,916
We've had eyes on that
target ever since,

42
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,876
and there's been nobody
in and nobody out.

43
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:57,630
Since when a guy like that
got three security detail?

44
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:00,883
He got 15 motherfuckers in there
with guns and you know it.

45
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:03,182
This intel is fucked up.

46
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,430
Well, we don't know
how many shooters

47
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,057
he could have already
in that building.

48
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,726
Look, before we stick
our dick in anything,

49
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,813
we're gonna sneak up and take
a good look before we commit.

50
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,940
Here's to dead enemies
and live friends

51
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,691
and all y'all
motherfuckers going home.

52
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,409
Roger that.

53
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,531
Let me tack up.

54
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,035
How it look out there?

55
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,996
Looks good. Good conditions, bro.

56
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,749
- Nice and quiet?
- Yeah, I like it.

57
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,335
I wonder how much pussy he get.

58
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,254
Do you think he get
more than, like,

59
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,598
Osama bin Laden got?

60
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,592
I'm... I'm gonna be
sorry to kill his ass.

61
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,511
A lot of virgins are
gonna be happy though.

62
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:49,107
- That's true, once he go up there.
- Yeah.

63
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:53,277
Okay. Take a look at this here.

64
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,480
That's our route in.

65
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:59,775
Let's get positioned in this building
here, but we gotta clear this first

66
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,944
before we get into the
hornets' nest over here.

67
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:05,289
Try to figure out...
we make a decision in here.

68
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:07,867
Oh, fuck me, man.

69
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,915
What you got?

70
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,761
Ghost to nest, ghost to nest,

71
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,346
you're getting too
close, man, back off.

72
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,973
You're gonna give my position away.

73
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,017
Roger that, Ghost.

74
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,685
Once Abu Normal is
confirmed to be in there,

75
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,645
you can take him out,
but wait for my word.

76
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,689
Standing by. Over and out.

77
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,108
We got the chickenshit
sandwich now, boy.

78
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,577
Well, let's go get this bastard.

79
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,601
Come on.

80
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,076
Clear.

81
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,801
Whoa. Thank you, bro.

82
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,818
Looks good. Compound clear.

83
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:58,180
Okay, Ghost, got
eyes on, settled in.

84
00:09:58,181 --> 00:09:59,640
You're good to go.

85
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:02,439
Oh. Check that. We got a rover.

86
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:05,688
Be advised: one rover.

87
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,870
Okay, that rover... he is up.

88
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,372
He's on top.

89
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:26,041
Looks like he's walking
off into the woods, bro.

90
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,418
You're clear. Go
ahead, make your move.

91
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:31,046
Looking good. Six is clear.

92
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,424
Movie Star, can you see
anything inside the hooch?

93
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:37,303
Negative. Hang on.

94
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,683
I see four.

95
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:46,728
Four Haj... check that,
check that, six...

96
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:50,399
six Hajis, all got AKs.

97
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,152
Ghost, a man in a white coat...

98
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,075
could be our second target.

99
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,910
Okay, confirmation
on target, stand by.

100
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,760
Ghost to nest, visual
confirmation on the target.

101
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,684
They're using human
shields. No joy, no joy.

102
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,270
This is Nest. We have a
lock on your position.

103
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:31,866
We have orders to initiate
Hellfire now. Stand down.

104
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,113
I repeat, they're
using human shields.

105
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,537
No joy, no joy!

106
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,800
Okay, be advised, our
rover is returning.

107
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,598
He's 30 yards out.

108
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,355
You're gonna have to
take this guy out.

109
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:13,607
I can't crack him there.
He'll create a hornets' nest.

110
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,192
You've got him. He's 10 yards out.

111
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:18,446
10 yards. He's on your six.

112
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,324
Five, four,

113
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,326
three, two...

114
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,454
two steps. He's there.

115
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,255
I'm going in now,
repeat, going in now.

116
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,303
On my way to you.
I'm on my way to you.

117
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,113
Move.

118
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:08,036
Call off the strike. Abu Normal's
on the move. Call off the strike.

119
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,335
- We've got women and children in here.
- Papa! Papi!

120
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,545
Target locked, sequence initiated.

121
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,261
Direct hit on Abu Normal.

122
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:26,639
No joy on the secondary target.

123
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,434
Call off the air-strike!
We've got kids in here!

124
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,983
Negative, Ghost.
Hellfire is initiated.

125
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,910
Come with me! We gotta
get out of here!

126
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,764
Flyby, this is command.

127
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,733
We have a direct hit.

128
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:22,570
Ghost! Ghost, how you doing?

129
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,991
It's my right... right side.

130
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,618
Check the girl.

131
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:32,621
- Nothing's broke.
- Check the girl.

132
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:35,250
Hey. You okay?

133
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,760
She's not moving.

134
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,063
Some things never change.

135
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:05,222
Mya, do you have the keys?

136
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,224
You hungry? Come here.

137
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:18,527
Don't tell me I lost them again.

138
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:22,690
- Hey.
- What's happening? Are you locked out?

139
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:27,574
- You want some help?
- This would be great.

140
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:35,161
The second time I've lost my keys.

141
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,339
I think I can fix that.

142
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,001
- My name's Lena...
- Nice to meet you.

143
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,795
and she's my sister, Mya.

144
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,965
- What's happening?
- What's his name?

145
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,510
You know, I just never named him.

146
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,303
You can name him.

147
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:54,804
Roman.

148
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,015
- Roman.
- Roman?

149
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,109
Roman it is.

150
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:07,572
Come on, doggy.

151
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,106
Pretty.

152
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,434
Good boy.

153
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:45,397
- Okay, there you go.
- Thank you. Wow.

154
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,023
That was easy.

155
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,693
- Thanks.
- Alexander.

156
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,787
Thanks, Alexander.

157
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,082
Mya.

158
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,159
Go inside and say goodbye.

159
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,828
- Bye.
- Bye, Roman.

160
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,663
Go, go, go, go.

161
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:04,165
I'll come by later and
drop off a new lock.

162
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,834
Any time.

163
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,838
Nice to finally meet you, neighbor.

164
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:13,009
Nice to meet you.

165
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,015
Come here, boy.

166
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,658
Where do you think you're going?!

167
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:38,663
Catch him!

168
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,384
Pick him up.

169
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:53,640
Let's go.

170
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,003
I have already paid!

171
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,881
I swear it.

172
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,015
Hey, Amerikansky.

173
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,888
He says he already paid.

174
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,891
When you speak to me

175
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:48,066
you speak in English.

176
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,447
You know that.

177
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,697
This is not fair.

178
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,865
I work hard for this money.

179
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,702
I understand. We work hard...

180
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,750
to provide you protection.

181
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,958
But it comes at a price.

182
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:15,089
I think I need protection
from Mr. Vladimir.

183
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,933
Hey!

184
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,635
You don't pay up next week,

185
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,303
I'm taking your fucking tongue.

186
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,680
Don't!

187
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:26,559
Okay okay. Okay.

188
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,812
Just give me a second.

189
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:44,785
How much are you short?

190
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:51,250
Watch the door.

191
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,904
Don't mistake this act of kindness

192
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:22,827
as weakness.

193
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,992
Are we clear?

194
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:29,830
- Are we clear?
- Yeah.

195
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,546
He's square. I'm gonna grab a bite.

196
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,598
Da?

197
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,221
Da. Wait.

198
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:48,389
Vladimir says there's a problem.

199
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,517
He wants you to check it out.

200
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:24,259
Same as others?

201
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,927
Da, sliced and diced.

202
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:27,600
Identical MO.

203
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:40,777
Gangs killing rival gangs I guess?

204
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,820
But why leave incense?

205
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:45,864
It's Chinese.

206
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:50,535
They believe incense to be associated
with the "yin" energies of the dead.

207
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:53,663
Burning joss sticks
attracts ghosts,

208
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:57,834
who consume the smoke and destroy
the fortunes of the family.

209
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,382
It's symbolic.

210
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,308
Googled it.

211
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:36,623
These guys... look very Russian.

212
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:39,834
Yeah. The cross
signifies prison time

213
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,337
and the ring finger indicates rank.

214
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:45,591
This arm belongs to a lieutenant.

215
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:53,770
Okay. So...

216
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,351
let's find out which Russian gangs

217
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,479
are missing a lieutenant...

218
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:02,487
and has a beef with the
Chinaman assassins.

219
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,408
Hey, Sasha, I don't suppose

220
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,786
you'd know anything about
this mess, would you?

221
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:17,205
You know me better
than that, Constable.

222
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:19,333
I'm just getting a bite.

223
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,593
Afternoon, Father.

224
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:13,594
Alexander. I've seen you
pass by many many times.

225
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:16,472
First time you
actually came inside.

226
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:19,100
Yeah, just looking around.

227
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:22,400
Of course. Feel free.

228
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,940
Thanks.

229
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,599
You must be Mya's brother.

230
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,394
- Yeah, how'd you know?
- Hey, where's your dog?

231
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:07,274
You mean Roman.
He's at my apartment.

232
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:09,817
I'll bring him by later.

233
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:12,820
That's the man I've been
telling you about...

234
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,119
our new neighbor with the dog.

235
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:21,000
Okay. I gotta get out of here.

236
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,373
Just in case...

237
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,250
you get hungry, here's a little...

238
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,845
whoa. Hey. No, you
can't have all that.

239
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,173
- There you go.
- Thank you.

240
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:34,642
You're coming by tonight?

241
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:36,928
I can't. I gotta work,

242
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,521
but I'll call.

243
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:40,681
- You still have it?
- Have what?

244
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,650
The key.

245
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,393
What key?

246
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:46,562
I give you... on the neck.

247
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,606
I don't know what
you're talking about.

248
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,950
The neck.

249
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:56,531
- Yeah. Yeah!
- This key. This key.

250
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:58,407
- Yeah.
- Of course I have.

251
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:00,910
I never leave home without it.

252
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:02,787
- Good.
- All right.

253
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,460
I'll see you later.

254
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:37,780
No. But whoever it was

255
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,658
left joss sticks on
the bodies again.

256
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,452
Yeah, he's sending a message.

257
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,876
And the money?

258
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:52,428
One last thing. Vladimir...

259
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:55,261
who is she?

260
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,848
Just a girl.

261
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:30,124
Feels light.

262
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:33,127
It's all in there, sir.

263
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,671
If you like, I could...

264
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:38,132
at least you and your men
made it here alive tonight.

265
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:41,219
Let's keep it that way.
I can't afford to do business

266
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,189
with some Chinese
ninja out hunting us.

267
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,891
Give this to Chen... clean.

268
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,851
And before you go, enjoy the girls.

269
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,899
Tonight, it's on the house.

270
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,782
Hey!

271
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:59,492
Try Lena, the girl behind the bar.

272
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,791
Leave the girl alone.

273
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:15,169
It's all there.

274
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,005
My sister working here was
not part of our deal.

275
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,341
You are telling me what to do now?

276
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:23,261
Your sister is here so I
can keep an eye on her,

277
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,846
- to keep her safe.
- If she works here,

278
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,682
I say she's for sale,

279
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:30,311
like the rest of the bitches.

280
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:46,667
You promised my
family protection...

281
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:51,961
if I came here to work
off my father's debt.

282
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,959
I am upholding my part of the deal.

283
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,045
Yes, and you are very
good at what you do.

284
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,389
That makes you valuable to me.

285
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,138
You want out, no?

286
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:06,095
That's why you are here...

287
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:08,889
to rescue your family.

288
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,891
Noble, truly.

289
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,727
But Lena is beautiful.

290
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:16,198
She could make me a lot of money.

291
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:18,899
But Aleksey is right.

292
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,444
Lena here is nothing more
to me than a pretty girl

293
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:24,322
behind the bar, and
until the debt is paid,

294
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:29,076
she is my girl, not yours.

295
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,170
Remember that.

296
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,769
- Who is it?
- Alexander.

297
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:53,522
Wait a minute.

298
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:02,985
I brought you a new lock,

299
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:06,447
unless you and your sister want
to keep using a screwdriver.

300
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:08,916
Wait a minute.

301
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,625
Hey.

302
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:20,424
Hi, Roman. Come on.

303
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:24,678
Come on.

304
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,826
Okay, so you're an American.

305
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:54,625
What are you doing here?

306
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:56,664
Sasha's an American.

307
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:59,291
What's he doing here?
He's... kind of over there

308
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:02,670
with a guy who's not a
very good human being.

309
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:05,840
- What's your relation to him?
- Vladimir?

310
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:07,684
In business with him?

311
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:10,812
Yes, you could say that.

312
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:17,351
I only come here to drink.

313
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:20,062
This is kind of a bad neighborhood
you're walking through.

314
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,188
I thought I'd walk you home.

315
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,023
Hey, bitch.

316
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:25,568
Are you work here or what?
Hey, where are you going, honey?

317
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:27,361
I want a lap dance.

318
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:31,282
You know, it takes the IQ
of a mature caterpillar

319
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:33,242
to know the difference

320
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:36,162
between the staff and the dancers.

321
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:39,039
- You understand?
- I want that bar bitch to dance for me,

322
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,792
so fuck you.

323
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,924
- Shall we go?
- Are you for real?

324
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:51,393
Not really. It's all fake.

325
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:02,021
Well, Mya was worried.

326
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:04,690
Yeah, poor thing.
She's alone so much.

327
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:08,286
It was worse... a lot worse
before Sasha came back.

328
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,907
- And...?
- And...

329
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:15,409
Our father owed money
to the Russian mob,

330
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:20,211
he died and the debt fell
onto me and my sister.

331
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:24,001
And how is it you got
mixed up with Vladimir?

332
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,924
With Vladimir.

333
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,422
Sasha... Sasha is my half-brother.

334
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,799
He grew up in the states.
He was in the military

335
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,468
and was stationed over here.

336
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:34,720
So when he heard about our problem,

337
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,939
he came to help us out.

338
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:47,943
Hey, asshole, do you know
who that ho belongs to?

339
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:50,694
Yeah, she belongs to me.

340
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,780
Why? Vladimir sent you?

341
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:56,784
Tell Vladimir Piteras if he has
something to say, say it to me.

342
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,410
Take this. I'm gonna
talk to these guys.

343
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,458
- Okay.
- Can you do that for me?

344
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,399
Lock yourself out again?

345
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,119
No, just worried about you.

346
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:16,747
Why don't you come in?

347
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:26,382
Thanks.

348
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:30,377
I can't believe those assholes.

349
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,046
Thanks for helping me...

350
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:34,548
- again.
- I didn't do nothing, ma'am.

351
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:37,509
I'm just a handyman.
I work with saws,

352
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,179
and screwdrivers,
and hammers, and...

353
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,057
simple stuff like that.

354
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:44,975
They were Vladimir's men.

355
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:48,776
You said earlier that Sasha was
working with some dangerous men.

356
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,398
You know all about them, don't you?

357
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,150
I do.

358
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,070
Then you know once there is a debt,

359
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:57,404
there's no getting away.

360
00:35:57,405 --> 00:36:02,081
So, as long as Vladimir
needs Sasha, here we are.

361
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:06,246
But it will come a day when
Vladimir doesn't need him anymore,

362
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,415
- and when that day come...
- When that day comes,

363
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:11,251
you go away to a nice, safe place

364
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:15,347
and you have to never think
about them again. You hear?

365
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,594
I'm glad you made it home safe.

366
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,597
So am I.

367
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:53,460
Ooh, the rate this guy's going,

368
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:57,090
we're going to be out
of Russians soon.

369
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:00,635
Again with the incense.

370
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,638
And the Chinese
writing... Gwai Lo...

371
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,482
it means "white ghost."

372
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:08,600
But not a derogatory
sense, you know?

373
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:11,186
Like he sa... he's
saying it with pride.

374
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,646
You know?

375
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:16,316
A vendetta. So he's not Chinese.

376
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,943
Maybe.

377
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,786
Ah... okay.

378
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,952
Oh, I googled the tats.

379
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:29,171
You were right about
the last victims.

380
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,128
These guys...

381
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,502
have the same ink.

382
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,212
Yeah, but they're low level,

383
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:40,512
- Foot soldiers.
- So?

384
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,595
- Messengers?
- Bag men.

385
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,769
They were transporting something.

386
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:57,029
Something our assailant has
taken, probably money.

387
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,110
The way they are cut up...

388
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:03,030
the killer obviously is
very skilled with a knife.

389
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:07,456
Short sword. I'm guessing our
man is sending a message.

390
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,292
- A warning?
- Yeah.

391
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,623
But the question is,
a warning to whom?

392
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:14,341
But the question is,
a warning to whom?

393
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,565
Keep your mouth shut

394
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,818
and do what I do.

395
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:05,425
My buyer,

396
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,519
a very good customer...

397
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,639
he likes big weapons,

398
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,141
dangerous weapons,

399
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:15,686
expensive weapons.

400
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:20,693
All you had to do was launder
this money through your club.

401
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:24,328
Now the money's gone missing.

402
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:30,835
I cannot honor my
deal with my buyer.

403
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,206
Mr. Chen, I would never...

404
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,876
never... steal from you.

405
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:41,044
But these murders, they
are disrupting my ability

406
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,130
- to do bus...
- Oh.

407
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:44,923
You were short last month.

408
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:48,802
This is your way of saying
you're short yet again?

409
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:52,933
No, Mr. Chen, I just
need more time.

410
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:14,579
Li Wei just confirmed that you have
this Russian girl at your club.

411
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:18,040
You are very fortunate...

412
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:20,500
that my buyer has this proclivity

413
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:23,003
for beautiful Russian girls.

414
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:25,422
The younger, the better.

415
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:29,009
Maybe I can... repair the situation

416
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,854
with the help of
your Russian beauty.

417
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:40,520
You know, I am reminded
of this old proverb

418
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:44,441
that if you stand by the
river's edge long enough,

419
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,652
eventually...

420
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:51,454
you will see your dead
enemy's body floating past.

421
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,671
the money or...

422
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:05,004
Your choice.

423
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,250
Why didn't you call me?

424
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:45,836
I told you, Alexander
took care of it.

425
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:48,422
- It wasn't any problem.
- It wasn't a problem?

426
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:51,216
- No.
- Right.

427
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:54,436
Lena, do you have any idea
what's going on right now?

428
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:57,811
You don't. You call me.

429
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:16,913
- Alexander?
- How can I help you?

430
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,412
Replacing the lock.

431
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:22,289
Oh, yeah.

432
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:24,124
What do you think I am,
man? Put that away.

433
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:27,127
And I also wanted to say thanks for
what you did for my sister last night.

434
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:29,050
I didn't do nothing.

435
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:32,466
Look, I do the best that I can

436
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:33,842
to take care of my family,

437
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:37,637
but I can't be all
places all the time.

438
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:41,062
So what you did last night...

439
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,777
I appreciate it.

440
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:47,689
Look, man, I have a
rope around here...

441
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:50,025
on the Russians, with the Chinese.

442
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:54,196
There's bad guys that live by a
code of ethics and follow the rules

443
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:55,822
and there are those who don't.

444
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,699
You're running with
those who don't.

445
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,118
You're right.

446
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,162
It's still none of your business.

447
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:06,918
- Keep that in mind.
- My family, my business.

448
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:12,672
All right.

449
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:14,841
We're not gonna be here
much longer, anyway.

450
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:17,219
You can count on that.

451
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,682
I gotta go.

452
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:24,935
Oh, and I sincerely hope that you didn't
have anything to do with what happened

453
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:26,603
to Vladimir's men last night.

454
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,401
Not me.

455
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:52,383
Hello.

456
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:55,632
Amerikansky.

457
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,134
Hey, Why'd you call
me at a payphone?

458
00:43:57,135 --> 00:43:58,510
I was downstairs at the club.

459
00:43:58,511 --> 00:44:00,387
So I would be able
to speak with you,

460
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:03,557
Knowing that our conversation
will remain in private.

461
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:05,105
Sasha...

462
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,227
I'm afraid we suspect

463
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:10,527
one of our own stealing
from Mr. Chen.

464
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,401
Are you talking about the murders?

465
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:16,904
Yes, Sasha, the murders.

466
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:22,742
Okay. Just wait a second.

467
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:26,538
Vladimir, I would never
steal from you or Mr. Chen,

468
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:28,665
let alone kill one of our own.

469
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,584
I may believe that, Sasha,

470
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:33,044
But Mr. Chen is not the
sort that is comforted

471
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:35,547
by panicked assurances.

472
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:38,091
But if it makes you
feel any better,

473
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:40,969
he will continue to care
for your lovely sister

474
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:44,264
long after you are dead and buried.

475
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:46,141
I didn't kill anyone!

476
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:48,736
I swear to you! You
have to tell him that!

477
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:06,124
Wait! Andrei!

478
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:31,603
and try your call again.

479
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:33,947
Please hang up.

480
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:53,834
Oh... fuck!

481
00:46:57,398 --> 00:46:59,195
Mya?

482
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:25,221
What's going on?

483
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:29,679
Where is Sasha?

484
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,890
Did something happen to him?

485
00:47:31,891 --> 00:47:34,893
- Yes, something happened to Sasha.
- What?

486
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:36,686
Your brother was a thief,

487
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,938
so he had to pay with
his life, I'm afraid.

488
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:41,983
- No, that's impossible.
- I'm afraid it's possible and finished.

489
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:44,277
But this is not the
reason I'm here.

490
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,621
I'm here for you.

491
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:49,949
You're a smart and
very attractive girl.

492
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:52,452
Now I can see why
Mr. Chen had decided

493
00:47:52,453 --> 00:47:54,704
to keep you for himself.

494
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:57,003
Don't touch me!

495
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,292
Now be smart and watch your tongue.

496
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:02,296
I don't want to mess up
that lovely mouth of yours.

497
00:48:06,342 --> 00:48:09,061
- No.
- Go in that room.

498
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,638
Mya.

499
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:13,482
Keep her quiet.

500
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:43,837
Mya!

501
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:45,510
Lena.

502
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:49,926
Mr. Chen is willing to
take her over money.

503
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:53,522
I'd be a fool to turn
her over so easily.

504
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:56,896
Okay.

505
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:59,561
Slight change of plans.

506
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:02,856
- Keep her safe. Let's go.
- Mya! No.

507
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:04,483
Stop!

508
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,651
Mya!

509
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:08,654
No!

510
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:32,344
Do that again and
your sister is dead.

511
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:35,847
Do you understand me?

512
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:38,476
Now be a good girl
and get in the car.

513
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,902
Oh Shit.

514
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:53,039
Quit staring at me, bitch.

515
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,953
Go on. Test me.

516
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:01,127
I dare you.

517
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:07,220
Give us a minute.

518
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:25,068
- What's going on?
- We got trouble.

519
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:30,619
Come on.

520
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:37,617
Stay here.

521
00:50:37,618 --> 00:50:39,285
Go back to your room.

522
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:41,254
Back to my room?

523
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:43,666
Uh-huh.

524
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:48,804
You want some?

525
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,784
You're gonna die, motherfucker.

526
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:32,172
Alexander.

527
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:36,926
- Are you hurt?
- No.

528
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:39,679
They took Mya. Sasha's dead.

529
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,390
- This can't be happening.
- Well, he... he's not dead.

530
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:44,100
That's for sure.

531
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:47,020
Why do you think Vladimir took Mya?

532
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:49,188
He said he was taking
her to Mr. Chen.

533
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:52,900
Mr. Chen wanted me,
but he took Mya instead.

534
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:56,112
I don't even know who Mr. Chen is.

535
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:58,365
Well, I do. Come on.

536
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:34,534
Sir, I know who took your money.

537
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:39,031
I don't care who took my money.

538
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,117
We made a deal.

539
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:45,411
The cash, the girl

540
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:50,166
or I'll kill you and
your entire family.

541
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:53,336
This is the thief's sister.

542
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:56,260
I brought her to you
for collateral.

543
00:52:58,634 --> 00:53:00,677
Are you gaming me?

544
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:04,102
Or do you have the biggest
pair of balls on earth?

545
00:53:06,058 --> 00:53:08,226
You're running out of time

546
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:10,445
and excuses, Vladimir.

547
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:18,277
Hi.

548
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:21,030
What is your name?

549
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,033
Mya.

550
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:28,621
Oh, your name is Mya.

551
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:32,041
She's the little sister
of the one you asked for.

552
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:34,585
I will have her soon
again, but until then...

553
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:36,588
I am Mr. Chen.

554
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:41,009
Take her to the safe house.

555
00:53:49,852 --> 00:53:51,394
The money is one thing,

556
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:54,897
but when people start
to die around me

557
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:58,901
with frequency and ferocity,

558
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:02,113
it usually means that
someone is trying to take

559
00:54:02,114 --> 00:54:03,786
what is rightfully mine.

560
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,994
Is this what you're trying to do?

561
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:10,204
Mr. Chen, please, I'm
getting your money.

562
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,414
I just thought...

563
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:13,499
no. No, no, no, no, no!

564
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,460
No, no, no! No!

565
00:54:15,461 --> 00:54:17,044
No!

566
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:19,013
No! No!

567
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:42,028
You think too much, Vladimir.

568
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:44,247
I'm gonna keep the girl.

569
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:58,219
I would start going if I were you.

570
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:02,066
- Where are we going?
- To see your brother.

571
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:04,535
My friend told me
he's hiding out here.

572
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:15,622
Follow me.

573
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:19,300
Sasha.

574
00:56:22,963 --> 00:56:25,006
Are you trying to kill me?

575
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:27,760
Okay, okay, it's good
to see you, too. Yeah.

576
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:30,094
Thank God you're alive.

577
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:31,637
Vladimir said that you're dead

578
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:34,140
- and I thought you were.
- Sorry to disappoint you.

579
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:39,312
Sasha, Vladimir and Aleksey took
Mya to someone called Mr. Chen.

580
00:56:39,313 --> 00:56:40,980
- What?
- Yeah.

581
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:43,107
So I know you don't trust me,

582
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:45,651
but you're gonna have to trust me.

583
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:47,620
Otherwise, I can't help you.

584
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:57,246
You know, there is an old
adage from Sun Tzu that says,

585
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:59,332
"When one first sets out for war,

586
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:02,335
first dig two graves."

587
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:06,339
And I'm hoping that you feel
that way about your family.

588
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:08,174
I'm hoping you're willing to die

589
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:10,009
in order to save your family.

590
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:12,638
How you feel about that?

591
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,353
Whatever it takes.

592
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:19,694
This I call...

593
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:23,522
It means "the Devil's
Butcher Knife."

594
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:25,775
I use it a lot. It's
the perfect weapon.

595
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:28,324
Very quiet.

596
00:57:30,364 --> 00:57:32,958
Why'd you kill Vladimir's men?

597
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:37,453
Two years ago I was
given an assignment

598
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:38,955
to terminate a couple terrorists.

599
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:42,541
One in particular, he was
working with am arms dealer,

600
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:44,293
and...

601
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:47,638
I got the terrorist and
the arms dealer got away.

602
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:51,717
- Mr. Chen.
- That's right.

603
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:54,720
So the last two years
I've been tracking Chen

604
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:58,224
through Asia, and went
to Hong Kong and...

605
00:57:58,225 --> 00:58:01,560
killed all of his men, triad style,

606
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:03,904
just to flush out Chen.

607
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:07,108
- What's in it?
- I wanted him to think

608
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:09,276
that it was inside-the-family job,

609
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:12,071
so I get in there and kill
the bad guys with a sword

610
00:58:12,072 --> 00:58:14,415
and leave joss sticks on the body.

611
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:18,202
You drew the w... the writing
on the wall. Gwai Lo.

612
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:20,621
I'm the one that's gonna
save your sister,

613
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:23,332
and I'm the one that's
gonna kill Chen.

614
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:26,211
Good. Let me help.

615
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:29,304
Open it.

616
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:38,848
It's the money from the drops.

617
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:41,602
It's... it's Vladimir's money.

618
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:46,439
All right, let me tell
you what you can do.

619
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,941
You go to Vladimir and
find out how much money

620
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:51,652
it's gonna take to buy her back.

621
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:53,863
So you just want me to stroll in

622
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:55,531
and talk to the guy
that tried to kill me?

623
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,408
Well, he's not gonna kill you,

624
00:58:57,409 --> 00:59:00,119
'cause he knows you're a part of
how he's gonna get the money.

625
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,121
You wait for me here.

626
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:04,707
You said you were
just a regular man.

627
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:06,292
Yeah, that's true...

628
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:10,423
I'm a regular man who does
bad things to bad people.

629
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:26,103
If Vladimir sees you
here, he will kill you.

630
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:28,898
- You know that, right?
- Yeah.

631
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:31,367
Just let him know I'm here.

632
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:45,165
Hi, Sasha.

633
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:48,300
I'm supposed to give you a dance.

634
00:59:50,796 --> 00:59:52,923
Of course you are.

635
01:00:01,473 --> 01:00:04,817
So why did he send you and
not one of his goons?

636
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,812
I don't ask questions, Sasha.

637
01:00:07,813 --> 01:00:09,688
You know that.

638
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:11,566
I just do as I'm told.

639
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,860
Look, why don't you just sit back

640
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:17,034
and enjoy the dance?

641
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,922
Okay. Passion?

642
01:00:34,923 --> 01:00:37,972
I need to speak with Vladimir.

643
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:41,979
Thank you, Passion. That's enough.

644
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:47,060
I didn't think I would
see you again, Sasha.

645
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:49,528
Easy.

646
01:00:56,987 --> 01:01:00,036
I'll give you whatever
you want for Mya.

647
01:01:02,409 --> 01:01:03,909
The price is 300,000.

648
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,536
This is what I owe to Mr. Chen.

649
01:01:05,537 --> 01:01:07,663
Pay it and you can
have your sister back.

650
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:09,882
Sounds reasonable?

651
01:02:10,185 --> 01:02:11,777
300,000?

652
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:14,822
Yeah, reasonable as hell.

653
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:36,344
Finally.

654
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:41,841
Hey, look, there's our friend.

655
01:02:43,927 --> 01:02:45,135
Think he might talk either?

656
01:02:45,136 --> 01:02:47,855
I don't know. Let's find out.

657
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:51,850
Hey, Sasha!

658
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:54,645
- Yo, man!
- Let's have a word.

659
01:02:54,646 --> 01:02:57,490
Come. Come, come.

660
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:26,469
No no!

661
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:31,598
What? No, no, no, no, no!

662
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:33,225
No!

663
01:04:04,424 --> 01:04:06,221
Just a second.

664
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:16,311
Yeah.

665
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:18,525
I got it under control.

666
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:44,797
He said he would be back soon.

667
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,426
Best to relax

668
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:52,554
and not to work yourself up
any more than you are, Lena.

669
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:55,432
I know Sasha would do anything
for me and my sister,

670
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:58,268
- but Alexander...
- Is just like your brother.

671
01:04:58,269 --> 01:05:02,524
- A military man.
- A good man.

672
01:05:17,705 --> 01:05:19,331
Mr. Wei.

673
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:22,836
Yes, our buyer will be
arriving tomorrow morning.

674
01:05:23,378 --> 01:05:24,837
He'll be terribly disappointed

675
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:28,763
when I tell him there's
problems with our deal.

676
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:33,011
Won't the little one be enough?

677
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:34,847
Scratch Roberta's itch?

678
01:05:34,848 --> 01:05:37,516
I'm not sure if his
interest would dip so low.

679
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:40,686
Perhaps not, but... if they do?

680
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:42,521
We'll decide in the morning.

681
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:45,023
Okay. So...

682
01:05:45,024 --> 01:05:46,775
I'll bring her in the morning.

683
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,493
Yes.

684
01:06:16,264 --> 01:06:18,724
Tell me the truth and
I won't hurt you.

685
01:06:18,725 --> 01:06:21,569
Where is Mya?

686
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:23,770
I don't know.

687
01:06:23,771 --> 01:06:25,523
You don't know.

688
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:35,533
You want to take me to her?

689
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:45,217
Okay, where can I find Chen?

690
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:48,795
I can't tell you.

691
01:06:48,796 --> 01:06:51,840
If he finds out I sent you
to him, he'll kill me.

692
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:54,635
Okay, well, I'll kill you
a lot fucking worse.

693
01:06:54,636 --> 01:06:57,262
And I'm a lot better
at it than he is.

694
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:58,805
If I'm dead, you're dead!

695
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:00,599
Those girls are dead!

696
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,601
I don't mind.

697
01:07:02,602 --> 01:07:04,978
I don't mind if everybody dies,

698
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:08,440
but I will kill you really slowly.

699
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:11,364
Now where is Mya?

700
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:17,875
I guess it's gonna be a
long, painful night.

701
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:34,967
This is a very very
special compound,

702
01:07:34,968 --> 01:07:37,766
but it's gonna be slow
and fucking painful.

703
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:50,116
There will be no more
fucking around with you.

704
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:54,112
You want to tell me,
or you wanna die?

705
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:56,822
Either way is fine
with me at this point.

706
01:07:56,823 --> 01:07:58,824
I really don't give a fuck.

707
01:07:58,825 --> 01:08:00,909
Okay, I'll talk, I'll
talk, I'll talk.

708
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:02,502
Talk.

709
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,955
I'll bring you there.

710
01:08:04,956 --> 01:08:07,675
- I'll bring you to Mr. Chen.
- You'll bring me there? Perfect.

711
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:10,799
Get ready. We're going now.

712
01:08:19,887 --> 01:08:21,809
Hey.

713
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:26,143
Dude, what do you want?

714
01:08:26,144 --> 01:08:29,363
I already said everything
I gotta say to the cops.

715
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:32,608
Am I under arrest?

716
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:34,401
My friend...

717
01:08:34,402 --> 01:08:36,779
what for?

718
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:48,298
Chess?

719
01:08:51,669 --> 01:08:54,592
- What is your name?
- Alexander.

720
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:57,132
And you're here for
the little girl?

721
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:58,680
Yeah.

722
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:00,594
What is your business?

723
01:09:00,595 --> 01:09:02,304
When you say, "what
is my business,"

724
01:09:02,305 --> 01:09:04,389
you mean, what do I
do for a living?

725
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:07,809
- Yes.
- I'm a handyman.

726
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:10,062
A handyman?

727
01:09:10,605 --> 01:09:12,397
Well, Mr. Handyman,

728
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:14,983
I have good news and bad news.

729
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:18,328
The good news is I
do have the girl.

730
01:09:18,905 --> 01:09:20,572
The bad news is I need her

731
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:23,075
for another business transaction.

732
01:09:23,076 --> 01:09:26,204
Well, that's a shame, because...

733
01:09:26,746 --> 01:09:28,830
I came here to make
a deal with you,

734
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:31,458
and any good businessman
would always hear

735
01:09:31,459 --> 01:09:33,335
what another man has to say.

736
01:09:33,336 --> 01:09:35,504
I'm prepared to throw money down.

737
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:37,631
How much money are
we talking about?

738
01:09:37,632 --> 01:09:40,300
- How much you want?
- How about a million?

739
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:45,056
A million? How about
300,000 cash, right now?

740
01:09:49,102 --> 01:09:51,229
That's a good number.

741
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:57,150
I tell you what: you
come back tomorrow,

742
01:09:57,151 --> 01:10:00,621
bring your money and we
can do some business.

743
01:10:25,972 --> 01:10:27,973
What happened?

744
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:30,442
They took her.

745
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:37,942
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

746
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:40,152
'Cause now...

747
01:10:40,153 --> 01:10:43,657
I will snatch every
motherfucker birthday.

748
01:11:07,889 --> 01:11:10,357
Oh, fuck.

749
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:30,748
Shit.

750
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:23,964
Camera 4 is not working.

751
01:12:23,965 --> 01:12:25,590
I don't get a signal too.

752
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:27,388
No signal.

753
01:12:43,901 --> 01:12:45,744
Reboot the system.

754
01:13:07,133 --> 01:13:08,383
Three men...

755
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:10,802
two getting out of a limo,

756
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:14,014
one guarding the gate
that's in the driveway.

757
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:17,268
Looks like your tip might
actually be worth the trip.

758
01:13:23,024 --> 01:13:24,491
Still down.

759
01:13:26,694 --> 01:13:29,697
Pavel will be pissed
if something's wrong.

760
01:13:59,018 --> 01:14:01,853
Okay, let me hear
your theory again,

761
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:04,606
'cause you're drawing a
lot of conclusions here.

762
01:14:04,607 --> 01:14:06,950
Okay, so what do we know so far?

763
01:14:07,485 --> 01:14:09,527
Chinese guy with a sword.

764
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:12,864
"Gwai Lo." "White ghost."

765
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:14,787
Maybe not.

766
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:17,836
Dead Russians.

767
01:14:18,704 --> 01:14:21,627
And who's the big dog
in town these days?

768
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:25,543
Mr. Chen, the Chinese arms dealer.

769
01:14:25,544 --> 01:14:27,337
Okay.

770
01:14:27,338 --> 01:14:30,882
And we got nothing connecting
Mr. Chen to the murders.

771
01:14:30,883 --> 01:14:34,052
Hear me out. What if
Vladimir is laundering money

772
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:37,222
- for a deal for Mr. Chen?
- No. No.

773
01:14:37,223 --> 01:14:39,015
You have nothing to prove that.

774
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:43,111
What if our killer is
taking out Vladimir's men?

775
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:45,522
Okay. Why?

776
01:14:45,523 --> 01:14:47,565
In order to prevent Mister...

777
01:14:47,566 --> 01:14:51,070
to prevent Vladimir
from paying Mr. Chen?

778
01:14:57,952 --> 01:14:59,749
Lena?

779
01:16:25,039 --> 01:16:27,007
Sasha.

780
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:31,711
Are you okay? Are you okay?
Did they hurt you?

781
01:16:31,712 --> 01:16:33,759
- No.
- Okay.

782
01:16:58,531 --> 01:17:00,328
Come on.

783
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:07,123
- This way, this way.
- Let's go.

784
01:17:19,552 --> 01:17:21,594
Easy.

785
01:17:21,595 --> 01:17:23,688
Easy easy.

786
01:17:24,765 --> 01:17:26,891
You really didn't give me
a choice, you know?

787
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:29,477
- Pavel?
- I tried to steer you away,

788
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:31,396
but you wouldn't listen.
Talking all the time.

789
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:34,696
- Talking all the time.
- You work for Vladimir?

790
01:17:35,234 --> 01:17:36,985
Are you kidding me? Huh?

791
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:40,535
I work for Mr. Chen.

792
01:17:52,751 --> 01:17:56,546
- What?
- No, they're cops.

793
01:17:56,547 --> 01:17:59,674
Look, stay here until I come
back and get you, all right?

794
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:01,342
- Okay.
- Don't move.

795
01:18:01,343 --> 01:18:03,186
Okay.

796
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:25,283
Partner, you are...

797
01:18:25,284 --> 01:18:28,828
a real pain in the ass,

798
01:18:28,829 --> 01:18:33,379
but not anymore. Not anymore.

799
01:18:50,809 --> 01:18:52,435
No!

800
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,482
Watch out!

801
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:03,287
Li Wei, go! Warn Mr. Chen!

802
01:19:40,651 --> 01:19:42,778
Sasha!

803
01:19:48,534 --> 01:19:49,867
Go, go, go. I'm okay, I'm okay.

804
01:19:49,868 --> 01:19:51,995
Go, I'm good, I'm good.

805
01:20:28,449 --> 01:20:30,742
Too bad you are unarmed now.

806
01:20:30,743 --> 01:20:33,291
I am, too. Come on. Come here.

807
01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:48,602
You know what? Let's
make this a fair fight.

808
01:24:11,088 --> 01:24:14,465
Roberto. See, unteachable.

809
01:24:14,466 --> 01:24:16,764
You're early, my friend.

810
01:24:17,511 --> 01:24:19,604
Bongiorno, Mr. Chen.

811
01:24:45,038 --> 01:24:48,374
You have caused me much
trouble, Sasha. Much trouble.

812
01:24:48,375 --> 01:24:50,752
I guess that's the cost
of doing business.

813
01:24:51,878 --> 01:24:53,838
You should have never come back.

814
01:24:53,839 --> 01:24:56,512
Sasha, be careful.

815
01:24:57,301 --> 01:24:59,474
Shoot him!

816
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:34,962
Okay. Okay. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Stop, stop, stop.

817
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:37,010
Give it to me. Give it to me.

818
01:25:37,549 --> 01:25:40,051
Lena. Lena. Come on.

819
01:25:41,386 --> 01:25:42,887
It's okay. It's okay.

820
01:25:42,888 --> 01:25:44,639
It's okay.

821
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:46,562
I've got you. I've got you.

822
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:48,768
My squad car is over there.

823
01:25:48,769 --> 01:25:51,522
I'll call it in, make
sure she's safe.

824
01:25:56,234 --> 01:25:58,407
Go. Finish this.

825
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:01,781
- I'll be back.
- No.

826
01:26:01,782 --> 01:26:03,407
I'm gonna finish this.
I'm gonna finish this.

827
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:04,575
I'll be back.

828
01:26:04,576 --> 01:26:06,077
It's okay. It's okay.

829
01:26:19,675 --> 01:26:21,717
Okay, I'll take her.

830
01:26:21,718 --> 01:26:25,017
I'll find another
to clean my money.

831
01:26:25,555 --> 01:26:27,227
Excellent.

832
01:26:43,824 --> 01:26:46,409
Not very spirited.

833
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:49,038
Roberto, she's still young.

834
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:53,925
Ah. This is true.

835
01:26:54,459 --> 01:26:56,586
Make her a Shirley Temple.

836
01:27:05,137 --> 01:27:06,889
What do you want?

837
01:27:08,724 --> 01:27:11,350
I have an appointment with Chen.

838
01:27:11,351 --> 01:27:13,686
I got some stuff in here for him.

839
01:27:13,687 --> 01:27:15,484
Show me.

840
01:27:25,449 --> 01:27:28,247
He's clean. Mr. Chen
is expecting him.

841
01:28:05,739 --> 01:28:08,783
Alexander, I've got Lena.
She's safe.

842
01:28:08,784 --> 01:28:10,451
Stay on the perimeter.

843
01:28:10,452 --> 01:28:11,911
Wait for my signal.

844
01:28:11,912 --> 01:28:13,459
All right, copy that.

845
01:28:45,946 --> 01:28:49,573
Well, Mr. Alexander.

846
01:28:49,574 --> 01:28:51,742
Oh, you could just
call me "Alexander."

847
01:28:51,743 --> 01:28:53,202
As you wish.

848
01:28:53,203 --> 01:28:55,162
But addressing someone
in the formal

849
01:28:55,163 --> 01:28:56,413
is much more...

850
01:28:56,414 --> 01:28:58,249
polite. Don't you think?

851
01:28:58,250 --> 01:29:00,417
Yeah, it's impressive. Yeah.

852
01:29:00,418 --> 01:29:04,843
Listen, the deal was $300,000,
and I brought the money.

853
01:29:05,382 --> 01:29:06,632
You know, it astounds me

854
01:29:06,633 --> 01:29:09,385
how a handyman got $300,000.

855
01:29:09,386 --> 01:29:11,178
How did you get so much?

856
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:12,972
Well, that's kind of
none of your business,

857
01:29:12,973 --> 01:29:15,516
but the fact of the
matter is I got it,

858
01:29:15,517 --> 01:29:18,602
and we have a deal...

859
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:21,272
$300,000 for Mya.

860
01:29:21,273 --> 01:29:22,773
She's right there.

861
01:29:22,774 --> 01:29:24,650
I'm here to take you home.

862
01:29:24,651 --> 01:29:27,119
Oh, about that...

863
01:29:27,779 --> 01:29:29,906
I changed my mind.

864
01:29:36,705 --> 01:29:38,831
I thought you were a man of honor.

865
01:29:38,832 --> 01:29:40,499
I thought you were
gonna keep your word.

866
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:42,251
I thought we had a deal.

867
01:29:42,252 --> 01:29:46,213
No, no, no, no, no, we had
business... not yet a deal.

868
01:29:46,214 --> 01:29:48,257
But it's time to make a deal.

869
01:29:48,258 --> 01:29:51,510
I already told you she's
for another buyer,

870
01:29:51,511 --> 01:29:53,804
but her sister, however...

871
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:56,056
how much would you pay for her?

872
01:29:56,057 --> 01:29:59,560
Let's say 300,000 maybe?

873
01:29:59,561 --> 01:30:01,353
But you see, the deal was for Mya.

874
01:30:01,354 --> 01:30:03,147
Then I guess we have no deal.

875
01:30:03,148 --> 01:30:06,242
Yeah, well, I got all
this money here.

876
01:30:06,818 --> 01:30:09,662
What you want me to do
with all this money?

877
01:30:10,196 --> 01:30:12,915
$300,000, all right here.

878
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:18,370
You know, may I say

879
01:30:18,371 --> 01:30:19,997
either you are very brave

880
01:30:19,998 --> 01:30:22,333
or very naive for you
to come back here.

881
01:30:22,334 --> 01:30:24,126
Now, you didn't bring no firepower.

882
01:30:24,127 --> 01:30:26,503
If you did, we would've
honored our word.

883
01:30:26,504 --> 01:30:29,427
But you're nothing but a handyman.

884
01:30:29,966 --> 01:30:31,216
It'd be stupid for us

885
01:30:31,217 --> 01:30:33,844
just not to take that
money and kill you.

886
01:30:33,845 --> 01:30:35,220
I'm gonna give you one last chance

887
01:30:35,221 --> 01:30:37,189
to keep your word.

888
01:30:40,268 --> 01:30:43,354
You're gonna give
me one last chance?

889
01:30:43,355 --> 01:30:46,523
- That's what I said.
- In my house?

890
01:30:46,524 --> 01:30:49,197
With my people and my guns?

891
01:30:51,196 --> 01:30:52,868
Yeah.

892
01:31:07,587 --> 01:31:09,713
I lied, but that's what I do.

893
01:31:09,714 --> 01:31:11,557
I lie for a living.

894
01:31:12,717 --> 01:31:14,760
I got some bad news for you.

895
01:31:14,761 --> 01:31:18,731
See, I lie for a living, too.

896
01:31:19,224 --> 01:31:20,941
And guess what?

897
01:31:21,476 --> 01:31:23,811
I'm not a handyman.

898
01:31:23,812 --> 01:31:26,531
I'm a professional killer.

899
01:31:27,065 --> 01:31:29,408
I came here to kill you.

900
01:31:42,747 --> 01:31:45,215
You're Gwai Lo?

901
01:31:50,005 --> 01:31:51,927
That's the way it is.

902
01:35:07,452 --> 01:35:09,249
Sasha!

903
01:35:13,625 --> 01:35:15,626
Is this how you wanna go out?

904
01:35:15,627 --> 01:35:17,836
A man of war?

905
01:35:17,837 --> 01:35:20,590
A son of Guan Gong?

906
01:35:21,216 --> 01:35:22,716
Like this?

907
01:35:22,717 --> 01:35:26,470
Killing a child? This is not you.

908
01:35:26,471 --> 01:35:30,474
You look at the total summation

909
01:35:30,475 --> 01:35:32,818
of your whole life...

910
01:35:33,353 --> 01:35:35,696
and see your last breath.

911
01:35:36,898 --> 01:35:39,116
Is this it?

912
01:35:40,735 --> 01:35:42,737
Well said.

913
01:35:44,072 --> 01:35:47,115
All my life, I try to take
care of my han dais,

914
01:35:47,116 --> 01:35:49,326
honor Guan Gong,

915
01:35:49,327 --> 01:35:51,828
amassed wealth and power,

916
01:35:51,829 --> 01:35:54,373
but no one close would tell me

917
01:35:54,374 --> 01:35:57,969
it's by trickery and deceit.

918
01:36:00,129 --> 01:36:02,339
It took an adversary

919
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:06,344
to show me the significance
of life and death.

920
01:36:08,513 --> 01:36:10,514
If we can resolve this

921
01:36:10,515 --> 01:36:13,985
by the code of Gong...

922
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:17,153
as han dai...

923
01:36:17,689 --> 01:36:19,816
men of honor...

924
01:36:20,650 --> 01:36:22,652
by the sword...

925
01:36:23,528 --> 01:36:25,325
would you?

926
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:48,218
Come here, come here.
Mya, Mya, get over here.

927
01:36:48,219 --> 01:36:49,811
Come here.

928
01:37:38,436 --> 01:37:41,314
Now I can die in peace...

929
01:37:46,694 --> 01:37:48,286
Yes.

930
01:38:00,375 --> 01:38:02,334
Come here.

931
01:38:02,335 --> 01:38:03,752
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

932
01:38:03,753 --> 01:38:05,675
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

933
01:38:15,306 --> 01:38:16,765
Are you sure this is what you want?

934
01:38:16,766 --> 01:38:19,268
There's nothing here
for her anymore.

935
01:38:19,811 --> 01:38:23,281
I don't want to lose you again.

936
01:38:24,816 --> 01:38:26,818
I don't want to lose
you either, squirt.

937
01:38:35,326 --> 01:38:37,411
I'm gonna give you this dog.

938
01:38:37,412 --> 01:38:40,040
He's a good dope dog.
That's where I got him.

939
01:38:40,790 --> 01:38:42,249
Are you sure you don't
wanna come with?

940
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:44,668
Yeah, I'm sure. I'm retired.

941
01:38:44,669 --> 01:38:47,504
And if you're retired, you're
gonna need some company.

942
01:38:47,505 --> 01:38:49,714
You got any ideas?

943
01:38:49,715 --> 01:38:51,467
Yes.

944
01:38:52,593 --> 01:38:55,178
It's finally over. Hear me, kiddo?

945
01:38:55,179 --> 01:38:57,180
Don't forget to call me, yes?

946
01:38:57,181 --> 01:38:58,648
Yes.

947
01:39:10,194 --> 01:39:13,321
It's good to see you.
Take care, okay?

948
01:39:13,322 --> 01:39:14,990
- Mm-hmm.
- Talk to you soon.

949
01:39:14,991 --> 01:39:17,325
- Thanks for coming home.
- Of course.

950
01:39:17,326 --> 01:39:19,369
Oh, let me give this to you.

951
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:22,840
It's good luck... from Mya.

952
01:39:24,709 --> 01:39:26,209
Never leave home without it.

953
01:39:26,210 --> 01:39:29,463
Okay. Thank you.

954
01:39:29,464 --> 01:39:31,261
Bye.

955
01:39:33,634 --> 01:39:35,556
Bye.

956
01:39:53,446 --> 01:39:54,905
All right.

957
01:39:54,906 --> 01:39:56,407
Help me walk him.

958
01:40:17,845 --> 01:40:19,938
Buckle up.
