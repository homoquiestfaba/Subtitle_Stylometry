with some kind of a strategy.

918
00:36:23,093 --> 00:36:24,443
All right?

919
00:36:24,486 --> 00:36:25,922
Yeah, all right.

921
00:36:27,707 --> 00:36:28,925

What, babe?

923
00:36:37,978 --> 00:36:42,548
I'm just feeling thankful
that I have you to come home to.

924
00:36:49,946 --> 00:36:52,340
Well, now you know
how I felt all these years.

925
00:36:58,825 --> 00:37:00,435
We're so lucky.

926
00:37:20,586 --> 00:37:22,196

you mean, gone?

Yes. Gone.

929
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,854

he could get his hands on.

930
00:37:27,897 --> 00:37:29,159
Wait...

931
00:37:29,203 --> 00:37:31,205
Thank god
I still have my business.

932

933
00:37:32,075 --> 00:37:33,163
I confronted him.

934
00:37:33,207 --> 00:37:34,339
I had to.

935
00:37:34,382 --> 00:37:37,864
Oh, Sally, I told you not to.

936

938
00:37:40,214 --> 00:37:42,042

horrible for me.

939

Hey, babe, don't beat
yourself up over it.

944

It's not your fault.

945
00:37:53,183 --> 00:37:54,533
Yeah, it was.

946
00:37:54,576 --> 00:37:56,665
I shouldn't have said
anything to her

947
00:37:56,709 --> 00:37:59,320
till I had the guy
absolutely dead to rights.

948
00:37:59,364 --> 00:38:02,323
Most situations like this
require a professional.

949
00:38:02,367 --> 00:38:04,891
You know, your pipes break,
you call a plumber.

950
00:38:04,934 --> 00:38:07,110
What?

951
00:38:07,154 --> 00:38:08,938
Look, you were fine
before all this

952
00:38:08,982 --> 00:38:10,723
and if you quit
you'll be fine after.

953
00:38:10,766 --> 00:38:12,202
No, I'm not quitting.

954
00:38:12,246 --> 00:38:13,856
I'm not.

955
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:17,295
Actually, Peter Fisher says
I can rent office space

956
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:18,426
down at his firm.

957
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:20,733
Do you think maybe
you're getting

958
00:38:20,776 --> 00:38:23,083
a little bit ahead
of yourself here?

959

I... I want to do something.

Honey, look, it is one thing

to look up records
in a courthouse

965
00:38:35,791 --> 00:38:37,445
but you could get hurt.

966
00:38:37,489 --> 00:38:40,230
I'm not just talking
about your feelings.

967
00:38:40,274 --> 00:38:41,231
I'm very careful.

968
00:38:41,275 --> 00:38:42,842
No, these people, these...

969
00:38:42,885 --> 00:38:44,757
Some wacko you're trailing
finds out

970
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,280
then youbecome the target.

971
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,629
Oh...

972
00:38:47,673 --> 00:38:49,631
You walk into some
domestic altercation

973
00:38:49,675 --> 00:38:51,764
do you know that's how
more cops are killed?

974
00:38:51,807 --> 00:38:52,982
You never know

975
00:38:53,026 --> 00:38:54,854
what you're going
to walk into.

976
00:38:54,897 --> 00:38:59,554
Craig, for the first
time in my life there's...

977
00:38:59,598 --> 00:39:02,949
I found something that matters

978
00:39:02,992 --> 00:39:06,866
that... I can actually do.

979
00:39:06,909 --> 00:39:09,172
And I'm going to do it.

980
00:39:15,222 --> 00:39:17,398
Tess:
Yes, if you could just give US

981
00:39:17,442 --> 00:39:19,487
the correct spelling
of your name?

982
00:39:20,619 --> 00:39:21,881
Right... yes.

983
00:39:21,924 --> 00:39:24,710
That's how we have it
in our directory.

984
00:39:24,753 --> 00:39:27,408
Great.

985
00:39:27,452 --> 00:39:29,367
Thank you very much.

How are you?

988
00:39:31,456 --> 00:39:32,457
I'm fine.

989
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,936
Peter Fisher just told me

990
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,721
you opened
your own office here.

991
00:39:35,764 --> 00:39:36,722
Yeah. Come on in.

992
00:39:36,765 --> 00:39:38,158
It's nice to see you again.

993

You, too.

994
00:39:39,202 --> 00:39:40,595
I wanted you to know

995
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:42,597
that Maggie and I
are in counseling.

996
00:39:42,641 --> 00:39:43,598
We're trying

997
00:39:43,642 --> 00:39:44,947
to make it work out.

998
00:39:44,991 --> 00:39:45,948
Good.

999
00:39:45,992 --> 00:39:47,602
That's wonderful.

Um, do you want to...

1001
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,083
No, I'm not
going to keep you.

1002
00:39:50,126 --> 00:39:52,564
I just came by to say thanks
for everything

1003
00:39:52,607 --> 00:39:54,348
and I wish you
the best of luck.

1004
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,180
You take care.

1005
00:40:00,223 --> 00:40:02,269

on retainer.

Yes, Mr. Turner, Tess McCall.

Yeah, I spoke to him.

1016

I got his particulars

1017
00:40:28,251 --> 00:40:31,211

to start.

who was that guy?

to call it a day?

The toilet in the guest room
is broken, did I tell you?

1457
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:43,237
You have to jiggle it
every time you flush.

what to tell them.

Well, just what you told me.

You have to jiggle it.

to call them?

No, I will.

Well, if you want me to,
just say so.

No, I said I would.

Fine. Call.

to be late.

after school.

Bye, sweetheart.
Have a good day.

1475
01:03:24,322 --> 01:03:25,584
I had some files.

1476
01:03:25,627 --> 01:03:26,846
Did you see them?

01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:28,065
No.

You sure?

1479
01:03:29,109 --> 01:03:30,023
Of course.

1480
01:03:30,067 --> 01:03:31,982
Why would I see them?

1481
01:03:34,854 --> 01:03:38,075
'Cause sometimes
you see them.

If I wanted to see
your stupid files

1487
01:03:50,696 --> 01:03:52,872
I could do it without
you even knowing it.

[ Chuckles]
Yeah, sure.

1489

God, I can't believe
this was going on

blind to it!

1495
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:14,024
Hell of a job, Tess.

1496
01:04:14,067 --> 01:04:16,461
You and I need
to get together sometime.

1497

My friend could use an
investigator with your
kind of fortitude.

Thanks.
