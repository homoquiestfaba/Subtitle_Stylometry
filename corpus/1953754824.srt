1
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:55,984
Duncan?

2
00:00:59,255 --> 00:01:00,555
Duncan?

3
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:04,760
Duncan, are you sleeping?

4
00:01:07,597 --> 00:01:08,997
No.

5
00:01:12,769 --> 00:01:14,536
Let me ask you something.

6
00:01:16,973 --> 00:01:20,709
On a scale of one to ten,
what do you think you are?

7
00:01:28,418 --> 00:01:31,253
Duncan? I'm asking you
how you see yourself.

8
00:01:31,255 --> 00:01:33,021
Scale of one to ten.

9
00:01:34,091 --> 00:01:35,725
I don't know.

10
00:01:37,428 --> 00:01:39,996
I can't hear you, bud.
You have to speak up.

11
00:01:39,998 --> 00:01:41,631
I don't know.

12
00:01:41,633 --> 00:01:44,600
What? What don't you know?
How you see yourself?

13
00:01:44,602 --> 00:01:46,469
You don't have any opinion?

14
00:01:52,476 --> 00:01:53,876
I'm just asking.

15
00:01:57,314 --> 00:01:59,916
Pick any number,
scale of one to ten.

16
00:01:59,918 --> 00:02:02,752
Just shout it out.
Say a number.

17
00:02:06,056 --> 00:02:07,390
A six.

18
00:02:07,392 --> 00:02:08,791
A what?

19
00:02:09,393 --> 00:02:10,793
A six!

20
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,797
I think you're a three.

21
00:02:17,101 --> 00:02:19,135
You know why I think
you're a three?

22
00:02:19,137 --> 00:02:21,571
Do you know what would
make me say that?

23
00:02:21,872 --> 00:02:23,840
No.

24
00:02:23,842 --> 00:02:26,242
You don't know?
You have no idea?

25
00:02:26,244 --> 00:02:27,443
No.

26
00:02:27,445 --> 00:02:29,045
You've got to speak up,
buddy.

27
00:02:29,047 --> 00:02:30,346
No!

28
00:02:31,648 --> 00:02:33,416
Since I've been
dating your mom,

29
00:02:33,418 --> 00:02:36,152
I don't see you putting
yourself out there, bud.

30
00:02:36,154 --> 00:02:37,954
Meeting kids your own age.

31
00:02:37,956 --> 00:02:39,589
And from what
your mom tells me,

32
00:02:39,591 --> 00:02:42,925
you just seem content to
hang around her apartment.

33
00:02:42,927 --> 00:02:47,330
Is that a fair assessment?
You're just happy not do anything?

34
00:02:47,332 --> 00:02:51,402
Because, damn,
to me that is a three.

35
00:02:53,471 --> 00:02:56,306
But, the good news
I'm here to tell you,

36
00:02:56,308 --> 00:02:58,308
since there's going
to be plenty of kids

37
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,943
and plenty of opportunities for you

38
00:02:59,945 --> 00:03:02,813
to take advantage of at my
beach house this summer.

39
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:06,817
It's a big summer
for all of us, really.

40
00:03:08,186 --> 00:03:10,754
You, your mom. Me, Steph.

41
00:03:12,023 --> 00:03:14,925
One day, we could become a family.

42
00:03:19,697 --> 00:03:23,133
So, what do you say? Let's try
to get that score up. Huh?

43
00:03:23,135 --> 00:03:24,902
Aim higher than a three?

44
00:03:26,971 --> 00:03:28,672
That sound good?

45
00:03:33,511 --> 00:03:35,345
You up for that, buddy?

46
00:03:44,823 --> 00:03:49,059
<i># It must be nice to be
full of good advice to say</i>

47
00:03:52,997 --> 00:03:57,668
<i># It must be sweet,
but I'll call you if I need it</i>

48
00:04:00,138 --> 00:04:04,608
<i># I'm doing all right for the time
Fine for the time being</i>

49
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:14,385
<i># I'll need professional help if it
does get any worse than this</i>

50
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:22,627
<i># I'll be out on the ledge if does
get any worse than this</i>

51
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:30,134
<i># I'm doing all right for the time
Fine for the time being</i>

52
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:38,776
<i># You think you
know me well</i>

53
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:46,885
<i># You think you
know me well</i>

54
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:55,393
<i># But you don't
know me at all #</i>

55
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:58,496
This is it.

56
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:11,709
Dad, could I get the keys?

57
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:35,734
Are you kidding me?

58
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:37,803
Thank God!

59
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:39,171
Another night of drinking alone

60
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:40,472
and I was going to kill myself!

61
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:41,607
Hey!

62
00:05:41,609 --> 00:05:43,809
I'm off the wagon again.

63
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:45,711
Accept it and move on.

64
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:49,615
Oh, my God.
Press my laundry.

65
00:05:49,617 --> 00:05:50,683
Oh, Trent.

66
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:51,884
How're you doing?

67
00:05:51,886 --> 00:05:53,719
I'm good.
I like this.

68
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:55,788
I love your ride.
Does the eight track still work?

69
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:59,291
What this? This is exactly the car
my dad used to drive us in.

70
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:00,759
Old and crappy.

71
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:02,895
Do you have any idea how much
I've spent on this car?

72
00:06:02,897 --> 00:06:04,563
This is cherry.
This is a cherry car.

73
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:06,165
A car salesman with bad taste.

74
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:07,232
Shocker.

75
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:08,267
Hi. I'm Betty.

76
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,072
Trent's probably already
talked crap about me.

77
00:06:13,074 --> 00:06:14,440
No.

78
00:06:14,442 --> 00:06:16,241
He did, didn't he?
It's okay if he has.

79
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:18,077
What did he say?

80
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,179
I'm loving this.

81
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:21,614
Oh, thank you.

82
00:06:21,616 --> 00:06:24,683
I couldn't pull it off.
My hair seems to hate me.

83
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:26,852
That's where you're supposed to say,
"Your hair's lovely. "

84
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:28,687
Oh, it, is.
It is lovely.

85
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:30,255
Okay.

86
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:31,457
I like her.

87
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:32,992
What's not to like?

88
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:38,697
Get it where you can. I'd be on
my back after a line like that.

89
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,871
Susanna, Trent's here.

90
00:06:44,873 --> 00:06:46,840
This is his new girlfriend,
Pam.

91
00:06:46,842 --> 00:06:48,408
Hi, Susanna.

92
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:51,011
Say, "Hi. "

93
00:06:51,846 --> 00:06:53,013
Hi.

94
00:06:54,682 --> 00:06:58,084
Yeah, but don't come down.

95
00:06:58,086 --> 00:07:00,520
Just stand there, brooding.

96
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:02,389
Oh!

97
00:07:02,391 --> 00:07:04,858
You've brought me a man.
How thoughtful.

98
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,760
Hello, sailor.

99
00:07:06,762 --> 00:07:10,664
Who is this in all his
awkward stage glory?

100
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:11,765
This is my son, Duncan.

101
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:13,299
Everybody lends a hand.

102
00:07:13,301 --> 00:07:15,468
Oh, my God. I was going to name
my youngest Duncan,

103
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,303
but my ex-husband thought
it was too nerdy.

104
00:07:17,305 --> 00:07:19,739
So, we went with Peter.
Which, personally, I think is worse.

105
00:07:19,741 --> 00:07:21,174
But, it suits my son, so...

106
00:07:21,176 --> 00:07:23,410
Oh, don't worry,
you wear the name well.

107
00:07:23,412 --> 00:07:24,577
Trent, where's Steph?

108
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:26,312
We've been here
all of two minutes,

109
00:07:26,314 --> 00:07:27,981
so I suppose she's getting ready
for the beach.

110
00:07:27,983 --> 00:07:30,383
Oh, my God. She's just like me.
Screw cancer.

111
00:07:30,385 --> 00:07:32,919
I want to be an even golden brown.
Everywhere.

112
00:07:32,921 --> 00:07:35,588
Everybody's back this year.
The Gales. The Hutchisons.

113
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,757
The Campbells, sans Ben
because of the trial.

114
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,492
Insider trading.

115
00:07:39,494 --> 00:07:42,429
The Smythes. Oh, and the Keegans,
who I'm not talking to.

116
00:07:42,431 --> 00:07:45,331
You can if you want to,
but just know that most of us aren't.

117
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,566
Okay.

118
00:07:46,568 --> 00:07:48,368
So, do you think you will?
Pam?

119
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,669
Do I think I will, what?

120
00:07:49,671 --> 00:07:51,905
Talk to the Keegans.

121
00:07:51,907 --> 00:07:54,207
Oh, I don't know.
I don't even know them.

122
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:57,077
Do if you want to but just know
that I'm mad at them.

123
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:59,345
I don't even want
to get into why.

124
00:07:59,347 --> 00:08:01,882
They called me a
See-You-Next-Tuesday.

125
00:08:01,884 --> 00:08:03,584
To my face.

126
00:08:03,586 --> 00:08:05,619
You're going to love it here!
Whoo!

127
00:08:05,621 --> 00:08:07,321
I've only had one.

128
00:08:08,256 --> 00:08:09,590
Yee-haw!

129
00:08:14,429 --> 00:08:15,930
So, how was your winter?

130
00:08:15,932 --> 00:08:17,565
Because our year
was a challenge.

131
00:08:17,567 --> 00:08:18,899
My niece was raped in October.

132
00:08:20,102 --> 00:08:21,235
Oh, my God!

133
00:08:21,237 --> 00:08:23,237
I know.
Not even food courts are safe

134
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:25,306
Oh, and Bob, that's my ex-husband.

135
00:08:25,308 --> 00:08:26,974
Finally came out of
the closet. Not a shock.

136
00:08:26,976 --> 00:08:28,275
Let's just say that, in bed,

137
00:08:28,277 --> 00:08:30,811
his favorite view was
the back of my head.

138
00:08:30,813 --> 00:08:33,948
My oldest, Charlie, is still into
the drugs and psychedelic music.

139
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:38,185
Drugs I get. But, come on,
Gary Garcia's dead! Get over it.

140
00:08:38,187 --> 00:08:39,286
Gary?

141
00:08:39,288 --> 00:08:40,387
Don't do drugs, Declan.

142
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:41,722
Duncan.

143
00:08:41,724 --> 00:08:43,724
Oh, and Susanna. You saw her.
She's a walking mood.

144
00:08:43,726 --> 00:08:45,526
She's going through
an "I hate my mother" phase.

145
00:08:45,528 --> 00:08:46,794
Taking her father's side, as usual.

146
00:08:46,796 --> 00:08:47,895
Hi, Mrs. Thompson.

147
00:08:47,897 --> 00:08:51,232
Oh, Steph, don't you look so cute.

148
00:08:51,234 --> 00:08:52,566
That's exactly
the kind of suit that

149
00:08:52,568 --> 00:08:53,868
got me pregnant the first time.

150
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,269
That's what I'm hoping for.

151
00:08:55,271 --> 00:08:56,370
Hey.

152
00:08:56,372 --> 00:08:58,339
I'm kidding!

153
00:08:58,341 --> 00:09:00,574
Oh, and Peter. Finally got his surgery
to fix his lazy eye.

154
00:09:00,576 --> 00:09:01,842
Now, it's even worse.

155
00:09:01,844 --> 00:09:03,344
I try to get him to
wear an eye patch,

156
00:09:03,346 --> 00:09:06,881
so people don't feel awkward.
But, what are you gonna do?

157
00:09:06,883 --> 00:09:08,015
I'm outta here.

158
00:09:08,017 --> 00:09:10,317
Oh, why don't you
take Duncan with you?

159
00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:14,088
Screw that. I told you I'm not
baby-sitting him all summer.

160
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,090
You're gonna take Duncan with you,
young lady. All right?

161
00:09:16,092 --> 00:09:17,758
Why don't you go to the beach, honey?
You'll have fun.

162
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,795
We're just going to
be unpacking here.

163
00:09:19,797 --> 00:09:22,230
We might be doing
some other stuff, too.

164
00:09:22,632 --> 00:09:24,099
Mmm.

165
00:09:26,103 --> 00:09:28,103
That's our cue, kids.
Come on.

166
00:09:28,105 --> 00:09:30,572
Now, listen, I am still having my
annual Fourth of July Clambake.

167
00:09:30,574 --> 00:09:31,673
And it will bleed into your yard.

168
00:09:31,675 --> 00:09:32,774
Okay.

169
00:09:32,776 --> 00:09:35,110
Bob or no Bob,
the party must go on.

170
00:09:35,112 --> 00:09:37,078
He's probably sliding
off our gardener right now.

171
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,814
Let's have a fun summer!

172
00:09:41,852 --> 00:09:43,518
Duncan, are you coming or what?

173
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,831
Have fun.

174
00:10:00,837 --> 00:10:02,604
Just keep your distance.

175
00:10:02,606 --> 00:10:06,508
And, just don't die. I don't need
that shit hanging over my head.

176
00:10:11,981 --> 00:10:14,416
<i>We can absolutely
party at my place.</i>

177
00:10:14,418 --> 00:10:16,785
My dad only gets to see me,
like, twice a year,

178
00:10:16,787 --> 00:10:18,753
so he totally just
wants me to be happy.

179
00:10:18,755 --> 00:10:21,423
That's exactly the type of parent
I'm going to be.

180
00:10:21,425 --> 00:10:23,024
I'm gonna do drugs with my kids.

181
00:10:23,026 --> 00:10:27,362
Oh, my God. I forgot.
Willem broke up with Jessica!

182
00:10:27,897 --> 00:10:29,097
No!

183
00:10:29,099 --> 00:10:31,099
Good. I don't get her face.

184
00:10:31,101 --> 00:10:33,134
It's like she fell on it.

185
00:10:33,136 --> 00:10:36,572
Oh, my God! Susanna, you have to
get on that this summer.

186
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,207
Yeah.

187
00:10:39,109 --> 00:10:40,309
Chad!

188
00:10:40,677 --> 00:10:42,011
Chad!

189
00:10:43,447 --> 00:10:44,680
Chad!

190
00:10:44,682 --> 00:10:45,781
What?

191
00:10:45,783 --> 00:10:47,516
I want to go in the water!

192
00:10:47,518 --> 00:10:49,151
Then, go!

193
00:10:49,153 --> 00:10:52,221
Baby, I'm right in the middle of tossing.
We talked about this.

194
00:10:53,824 --> 00:10:55,725
All right.
He's being weird.

195
00:10:56,593 --> 00:10:57,693
Let's go.

196
00:11:00,631 --> 00:11:03,566
Ew! What are you
staring at, perv?

197
00:11:03,568 --> 00:11:05,902
Where is that kid from, anyway?

198
00:11:05,904 --> 00:11:07,136
Albany.

199
00:11:07,138 --> 00:11:08,638
He and his mom.

200
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,641
My dad says they live in a
one-bedroom apartment.

201
00:11:11,643 --> 00:11:12,875
Tragic.

202
00:11:12,877 --> 00:11:14,477
I know, right?

203
00:11:15,412 --> 00:11:17,647
Uh, Susanna.
We're all swimming!

204
00:11:20,818 --> 00:11:22,618
What is her deal?

205
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,054
I don't know. She's been like that
since we got here.

206
00:11:48,545 --> 00:11:51,347
Duncan. We were just
coming to find you

207
00:11:51,349 --> 00:11:52,581
This is Peter.

208
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:53,816
Hey, Duncan.

209
00:11:56,921 --> 00:11:58,055
Hey.

210
00:11:58,589 --> 00:12:00,524
Oh.

211
00:12:00,526 --> 00:12:01,858
Just stare at the bridge of his nose.
That's what I do.

212
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,161
Mom.
Are you shitting me?

213
00:12:04,163 --> 00:12:05,629
If you wore the patch,

214
00:12:05,631 --> 00:12:07,564
I wouldn't have to keep
telling people that, would I?

215
00:12:07,566 --> 00:12:10,200
Duncan, I thought you and Peter
should hang out this summer.

216
00:12:10,202 --> 00:12:12,803
<i>Lord knows he brought enough
of his Star Wars dolls.</i>

217
00:12:12,805 --> 00:12:15,205
They're action figures!
And they're classics!

218
00:12:15,207 --> 00:12:16,373
Please.

219
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,208
They lose value if I take them
out of the box.

220
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,776
But we can still have awesome
battles with them.

221
00:12:19,778 --> 00:12:21,111
He needs human contact.

222
00:12:21,113 --> 00:12:22,646
He's having far too many
conversations with those dolls.

223
00:12:22,648 --> 00:12:24,648
No, I'm not!

224
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:25,749
Should we set up a time for you two
to get together tomorrow?

225
00:12:26,284 --> 00:12:27,451
Um...

226
00:12:27,453 --> 00:12:30,320
I should check with my mom.

227
00:12:30,322 --> 00:12:31,855
Oh. Okay.

228
00:12:33,391 --> 00:12:35,959
Don't stand us up.
We know where you live!

229
00:12:37,363 --> 00:12:40,430
I told you. Your eye makes
people uncomfortable.

230
00:12:40,432 --> 00:12:42,032
You're the worst parent.

231
00:12:42,034 --> 00:12:43,734
That is your father talking.

232
00:12:43,736 --> 00:12:45,168
Did he tell you to say that?

233
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:46,303
Yeah.

234
00:12:46,305 --> 00:12:47,437
He did?

235
00:12:47,439 --> 00:12:48,572
Yes.

236
00:12:48,574 --> 00:12:49,973
That's terrible.

237
00:12:52,343 --> 00:12:57,277
<i># And I can't fight
this feelin' anymore</i>

238
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:03,540
<i># Forgotten what
I started fightin' for</i>

239
00:13:04,723 --> 00:13:09,559
<i># It's time to bring
the ship into the shore</i>

240
00:13:09,561 --> 00:13:11,161
<i># And throw away...</i>

241
00:13:18,038 --> 00:13:19,337
Not doing it.

242
00:13:20,305 --> 00:13:22,573
You put it on.

243
00:13:22,575 --> 00:13:25,410
<i># Fire burns just like me</i>

244
00:13:25,412 --> 00:13:27,278
No, no, no, no.

245
00:13:29,048 --> 00:13:30,748
Help me. No!

246
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,816
Come on!

247
00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:38,990
No.

248
00:13:38,992 --> 00:13:43,828
<i># Carry a laser down the road
that I must travel</i>

249
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:49,033
<i># Carry a laser down
the darkness of the night</i>

250
00:13:49,035 --> 00:13:50,701
<i># Carry a laser...</i>

251
00:13:50,703 --> 00:13:53,871
Whoa! Whoa! Are you saying,
"Carry a laser?"

252
00:13:53,873 --> 00:13:55,573
That's what it is.

253
00:13:55,575 --> 00:13:57,909
Why would anybody write
a song called, "Carry A Laser?"

254
00:13:57,911 --> 00:14:00,044
Because they like outer space.

255
00:14:03,682 --> 00:14:05,316
Uh-oh!

256
00:14:05,318 --> 00:14:08,419
You just walked into the
wrong room, stranger.

257
00:14:08,421 --> 00:14:09,587
Who are you?

258
00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:10,655
Mom.

259
00:14:10,657 --> 00:14:12,323
This is Duncan, my son.

260
00:14:12,325 --> 00:14:14,992
These are Trent's friends,
Joan and Kip.

261
00:14:14,994 --> 00:14:18,763
Chief, I'm Kip. I'm the one who's
not grinding on you right now.

262
00:14:18,765 --> 00:14:20,465
I'm not grinding on him.

263
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:21,766
Yes, you are.

264
00:14:21,768 --> 00:14:25,803
<i># Carry a laser down the
road that I must travel #</i>

265
00:14:25,805 --> 00:14:27,338
I'll make it worse.

266
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,342
Mom, no.

267
00:14:31,544 --> 00:14:33,245
I'm out of here.

268
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,147
Oh, wait.
I made dinner.

269
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:38,317
Oh, shoot.
I have plans.

270
00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:40,586
Steph, wait,
check out his moves.

271
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,653
Whoo!

272
00:14:44,224 --> 00:14:45,724
Enjoy therapy.

273
00:14:47,494 --> 00:14:49,661
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

274
00:14:49,663 --> 00:14:51,363
- See you, Dad.
- See you.

275
00:14:59,973 --> 00:15:02,374
All right, we did that.

276
00:15:02,376 --> 00:15:04,543
Not me.
I could barely watch that.

277
00:15:04,545 --> 00:15:07,579
Buddy, any chance
you were on top of my car?

278
00:15:08,348 --> 00:15:09,815
No.

279
00:15:09,817 --> 00:15:12,918
Okay. 'Cause there
was a dent in the roof.

280
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,219
Big dent.

281
00:15:14,221 --> 00:15:15,721
It popped out.
It's fine.

282
00:15:15,723 --> 00:15:19,224
I was just wondering if you knew
anything about that?

283
00:15:19,226 --> 00:15:21,059
We did have bags up there, honey.

284
00:15:21,061 --> 00:15:23,595
That's true.
We did. Fair enough.

285
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:29,001
That was probably it. Right?

286
00:15:32,071 --> 00:15:34,039
Hey, Pam.
You need a hand?

287
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:37,910
Oh, no. Thank you.
We've got a system going on here.

288
00:15:37,912 --> 00:15:40,646
Yeah! We got a good
team here. Right?

289
00:15:42,215 --> 00:15:43,482
Good team.

290
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,983
Adorable.

291
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:47,754
Can you pass me
something to eat, sweetie?

292
00:15:47,756 --> 00:15:52,192
No, I can tell you exactly
where I was.

293
00:15:52,194 --> 00:15:54,327
Passed out in the dunes.

294
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:55,595
That's true!

295
00:15:55,597 --> 00:15:57,263
Yes! Because, you left me there!

296
00:15:57,265 --> 00:16:01,100
No, wait! Kip wanted
to go out on his boat.

297
00:16:01,102 --> 00:16:03,002
He said you would
be fine by the fire.

298
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:06,439
Here's what he said!
"Yoo, hoo! You never came back. "

299
00:16:06,441 --> 00:16:07,974
No, we didn't.

300
00:16:07,976 --> 00:16:09,509
I came back
the next morning.

301
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:10,777
- Yes!
- First thing.

302
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:13,546
And I had to poke her
with a stick to wake her.

303
00:16:15,483 --> 00:16:18,952
You know, I once went
to this luau-themed party.

304
00:16:18,954 --> 00:16:21,654
I'm sorry. No, please.
You were talking...

305
00:16:21,656 --> 00:16:23,256
No, you go.

306
00:16:23,258 --> 00:16:24,457
Tell your story, babe.

307
00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:25,525
No, it's dumb.

308
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:28,361
Well, now you have to tell it.

309
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:31,297
I went to this luau and I passed out
in the dunes, too.

310
00:16:31,299 --> 00:16:32,865
That's basically it.

311
00:16:36,938 --> 00:16:38,338
That's so funny.

312
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,941
No, it's just a similar thing to...

313
00:16:41,943 --> 00:16:43,176
No, totally.

314
00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:48,781
I have to point out by the way
I'm loading up for the third time.

315
00:16:48,783 --> 00:16:49,882
Thank you.

316
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:50,950
Bravo.

317
00:16:50,952 --> 00:16:52,952
And I apologize for this asshole

318
00:16:52,954 --> 00:16:54,487
springing us on you
at the last minute.

319
00:16:54,489 --> 00:16:57,290
No, not at all. I'm a caterer.
I love cooking for people.

320
00:16:57,292 --> 00:16:59,459
Oh, you cater?
That makes sense.

321
00:16:59,461 --> 00:17:01,060
One of her many talents.

322
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:03,563
Actually, she has some ideas
for fixing up the place.

323
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:06,834
Oh, yeah? Are you
gonna fix up the Riptide?

324
00:17:06,836 --> 00:17:09,970
No, I just mentioned rearranging.

325
00:17:09,972 --> 00:17:13,407
You should. Put your stamp on it.
I'm not set in my ways.

326
00:17:13,409 --> 00:17:15,009
Tell that to Christine.

327
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:18,946
"Somebody took my weed. "

328
00:17:22,217 --> 00:17:25,653
Okay. I'm sorry. I have to put my
son out of his misery.

329
00:17:25,655 --> 00:17:27,121
You're free to go.

330
00:17:28,356 --> 00:17:30,691
Hey, buddy,
take your plate with you.

331
00:17:30,693 --> 00:17:33,260
We clean up after
ourselves in this house.

332
00:17:34,729 --> 00:17:36,730
Okay, back to my story.

333
00:17:36,732 --> 00:17:40,968
Trent was it last summer that
you and I got stuck on our boat?

334
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:44,538
That is because this bastard buys
gas three dollars at a time!

335
00:17:57,152 --> 00:18:00,187
Susanna, close the screen door!

336
00:18:00,189 --> 00:18:02,623
I'm getting eaten
alive by mosquitoes!

337
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:11,598
I don't like the way you're acting,
young lady!

338
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,301
You wouldn't be this way
if your dad was here!

339
00:18:18,907 --> 00:18:20,007
Hey.

340
00:18:20,709 --> 00:18:21,876
Hey.

341
00:18:24,814 --> 00:18:26,548
Sorry about that.
I didn't...

342
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,083
I don't care.

343
00:18:28,085 --> 00:18:31,386
It's not like we were using
our inside voices.

344
00:18:31,388 --> 00:18:33,188
That's cool.
That's cool.

345
00:18:35,091 --> 00:18:37,525
So, you're a big fan
of REO Speedwagon?

346
00:18:38,427 --> 00:18:40,195
What?

347
00:18:40,197 --> 00:18:42,697
<i>Can't Fight This Feeling?</i>

348
00:18:42,699 --> 00:18:45,900
Oh, no. My mom must
have put that on there.

349
00:18:45,902 --> 00:18:48,136
Oh, and you just got to it
and thought,

350
00:18:48,138 --> 00:18:51,606
"What the hell. I'm going to sing
the shit out of it, anyway?"

351
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,109
Something like that.

352
00:19:00,783 --> 00:19:02,417
Sucks here, huh?

353
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:03,985
It's okay.

354
00:19:04,787 --> 00:19:06,187
It sucks.

355
00:19:06,189 --> 00:19:07,589
No. Totally.

356
00:19:09,258 --> 00:19:10,925
It blows.

357
00:19:10,927 --> 00:19:12,327
So much.

358
00:19:13,796 --> 00:19:15,196
It's tough, yeah.

359
00:19:23,272 --> 00:19:24,773
All right.

360
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:32,814
It feels like it's going to
be a hot summer.

361
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,084
Oh.

362
00:19:36,086 --> 00:19:37,786
I thought we were done.

363
00:19:38,254 --> 00:19:39,989
Oh.

364
00:19:39,991 --> 00:19:43,325
I was just thinking about that earlier.
The hot thing.

365
00:19:43,327 --> 00:19:45,594
And it just came to me again.

366
00:19:45,596 --> 00:19:47,730
So, I said it.

367
00:19:48,832 --> 00:19:50,232
Okay.

368
00:19:51,301 --> 00:19:54,804
Well, if anything else
comes to you again,

369
00:19:56,006 --> 00:19:57,440
I will be inside.

370
00:20:20,197 --> 00:20:21,797
Are you kidding me?

371
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:25,301
They drank all the beer.

372
00:20:35,912 --> 00:20:37,680
You're not looking
in the right place.

373
00:20:37,682 --> 00:20:40,749
Don't get mad at me, Peter.
I don't know where you're looking!

374
00:20:40,751 --> 00:20:42,017
Forget it!
It's gone!

375
00:20:42,019 --> 00:20:44,119
No, next time you say,
"Look at the seagull,"

376
00:20:44,121 --> 00:20:45,721
you just have to
remember to point!

377
00:20:45,723 --> 00:20:49,091
There goes one there now.
"Look at the seagull, Mother.

378
00:20:49,093 --> 00:20:51,360
"I wanna share it with you.
Isn't it pretty?

379
00:20:51,362 --> 00:20:54,530
"Look at the fence.
Look at me! Look!"

380
00:20:54,532 --> 00:20:56,665
Just point.

381
00:21:20,391 --> 00:21:21,858
<i># Here I go</i>

382
00:21:22,793 --> 00:21:24,394
<i># Out the door</i>

383
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:30,166

384
00:21:30,168 --> 00:21:31,768

00:21:32,637 --> 00:21:34,404

386
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,976

387
00:21:39,978 --> 00:21:41,711
<i># Which way to go</i>

388
00:21:45,917 --> 00:21:48,018
<i># It's her versus him</i>

389
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,687
<i># It's us against them</i>

390
00:21:50,689 --> 00:21:56,026
<i># You sink or swim

391
00:21:56,028 --> 00:22:00,830
<i># You bleed till you're bled

392
00:22:00,832 --> 00:22:02,766
<i># You lead or you're led...</i>

393
00:22:02,768 --> 00:22:04,267
<i>Lemonade?</i>

394
00:22:24,122 --> 00:22:25,556
Do you mind standing to the side?

395
00:22:25,558 --> 00:22:27,692
I'm getting your reflection
in the screen.

396
00:22:27,694 --> 00:22:29,393
Sorry.

397
00:22:29,395 --> 00:22:31,262
I wouldn't normally care,
but I'm having the game of my life.

398
00:22:31,264 --> 00:22:33,197
I'm on the cherry level.

399
00:22:33,199 --> 00:22:34,999
But that's the first level.

400
00:22:35,001 --> 00:22:38,936
Yeah, and I got one man left.
So, like I said, it's the game of my life.

401
00:22:40,272 --> 00:22:41,572
You like Pac Man?

402
00:22:41,574 --> 00:22:42,873
What?

403
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:44,775
It's a classic!

404
00:22:44,777 --> 00:22:47,211
Not into all the bells
and whistles, my man.

405
00:22:47,213 --> 00:22:49,113
Too much going on.

406
00:22:49,115 --> 00:22:52,450
See, my mistake is
that I get greedy.

407
00:22:52,452 --> 00:22:54,385
Going for all the ghosts and fruits

408
00:22:54,387 --> 00:22:56,454
instead of just clearing pellets.

409
00:22:56,456 --> 00:22:58,623
You know, there's a pattern.
Right?

410
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:02,727
Oh, don't tell me you're
one of those guys.

411
00:23:02,729 --> 00:23:05,863
Takes all the challenge out of it.
Anybody can learn a pattern.

412
00:23:05,865 --> 00:23:07,999
Owen, we gotta go!

413
00:23:08,001 --> 00:23:09,400
Come on.
Lunch hour's over.

414
00:23:09,402 --> 00:23:11,569
Well, so much for the game
of my life.

415
00:23:11,571 --> 00:23:12,903
But you still have
one more man left.

416
00:23:12,905 --> 00:23:15,439
No, I've yet to see
the second board.

417
00:23:15,441 --> 00:23:17,808
Gives me something
to look forward to.

418
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:19,310
The board's
always the same.

419
00:23:19,312 --> 00:23:22,313
Well, there's that.
Thank you. Now, I can die.

420
00:23:22,315 --> 00:23:23,447
Here. Get in here.

421
00:23:23,449 --> 00:23:24,515
No, I...

422
00:23:24,517 --> 00:23:25,950
Come on, come on.

423
00:23:27,886 --> 00:23:29,620
But, listen, it's still my quarter.

424
00:23:29,622 --> 00:23:32,124
So, if you end up getting a high score,
I don't want to see... What's your name?

425
00:23:32,126 --> 00:23:33,291
Duncan.

426
00:23:33,293 --> 00:23:35,494
I don't want to see
that up on the screen.

427
00:23:35,496 --> 00:23:37,963
Oh, they only let
you use three letters.

428
00:23:38,631 --> 00:23:40,332
Wow.

429
00:23:40,334 --> 00:23:43,201
Nothing's left to the imagination
with you, huh, kid?

430
00:23:44,871 --> 00:23:46,838
Oh and hey!

431
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,409
No pattern on my quarter.
Cut your own path.

432
00:24:00,787 --> 00:24:03,088
There you are. We were just about
to leave without you.

433
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:04,256
Where did you go off to?

434
00:24:04,258 --> 00:24:05,323
Nowhere.

435
00:24:05,325 --> 00:24:06,391
Let's leave notes, okay?

436
00:24:06,393 --> 00:24:07,793
Your mom was worried.

437
00:24:07,795 --> 00:24:09,161
You need to get
your swim trunks on.

438
00:24:09,163 --> 00:24:10,362
Kip and Joan have invited us
out on their boat.

439
00:24:10,364 --> 00:24:11,930
We're gonna be late.

440
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,101
<i>Head's up, buddy.</i>

441
00:24:16,103 --> 00:24:17,235
You need to wear that.

442
00:24:17,237 --> 00:24:18,670
I think he's gonna be
all right without that.

443
00:24:18,672 --> 00:24:20,072
No, Duncan can't swim.

444
00:24:20,074 --> 00:24:21,907
Trent, he's just not
a comfortable swimmer.

445
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:23,742
I really think he's
gonna be okay without it.

446
00:24:23,744 --> 00:24:26,945
No, just wear it. So people don't
have to worry about you.

447
00:24:28,582 --> 00:24:32,050
Yes, we're inviting ourselves.
Accept it and move on.

448
00:24:32,052 --> 00:24:33,852
Peter does have to
stay down below though.

449
00:24:33,854 --> 00:24:35,320
His eye throws off his equilibrium

450
00:24:35,322 --> 00:24:36,722
and he will get sick everywhere.

451
00:24:36,724 --> 00:24:38,023
No, I won't, Mom!

452
00:24:38,025 --> 00:24:39,791
Tell that to the bucket
we have to bring!

453
00:24:39,793 --> 00:24:42,260
Mom, why do I have to wear this?
Nobody else does.

454
00:24:42,262 --> 00:24:44,796
He just wants you to be safe.

455
00:24:45,765 --> 00:24:47,332
Is that snug enough?

456
00:24:51,739 --> 00:24:53,372
You know what?
We take our shoes off.

457
00:24:53,374 --> 00:24:54,540
Oh, God. Sorry.

458
00:24:54,542 --> 00:24:56,075
Tell me this is gonna clear, Trent.

459
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:57,410
It's gonna clear.

460
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:59,278
My titties need some color.

461
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:12,391
<i>Basically, he was relentless.</i>

462
00:25:12,393 --> 00:25:14,494
And don't get me wrong.
I was looking.

463
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:17,797
I had been divorced
for well over a year.

464
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:20,433
It just took a little
persistence on my end.

465
00:25:21,769 --> 00:25:23,402
I wasn't sure about you.

466
00:25:23,404 --> 00:25:25,271
I met her when
she was catering

467
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:27,206
some Halloween party in Albany.

468
00:25:27,208 --> 00:25:28,608
He went as a sexy cop.

469
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,909
Oh, God!

470
00:25:29,911 --> 00:25:31,410
No. I went as a '70s,
badass cop.

471
00:25:31,412 --> 00:25:33,980
Oh, he followed me
around all night,

472
00:25:33,982 --> 00:25:36,415
saying that he was there to
"protect and serve" me.

473
00:25:36,417 --> 00:25:38,317
That about ended it
right there for me.

474
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:40,820
Sadly, I would have been
working his bag at that point.

475
00:25:40,822 --> 00:25:42,822
However, I do remember.

476
00:25:42,824 --> 00:25:45,658
You did let me help you pack
your van at the end of the night.

477
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,326
- Yes, I did.
- Yes, you did.

478
00:25:47,328 --> 00:25:49,328
Then it took three months
to get her to go out with me.

479
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:51,898
Three months?

480
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,966
I did not know you had
that kind of stamina.

481
00:25:53,968 --> 00:25:55,468
She definitely made me work for it.

482
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,569
But it was worth it.

483
00:25:56,571 --> 00:25:59,071
There may be hope for you yet.

484
00:25:59,073 --> 00:26:00,940
What finally changed your mind?

485
00:26:00,942 --> 00:26:03,776
He said we were
already in this together,

486
00:26:04,845 --> 00:26:06,412
so I might as well.

487
00:26:08,116 --> 00:26:09,883
It's been almost a year.

488
00:26:10,985 --> 00:26:12,119
Yeah.

489
00:26:19,727 --> 00:26:20,961
Duncan.

490
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,798
You guys, help yourselves.

491
00:26:29,537 --> 00:26:31,972
Could you look a little
more miserable?

492
00:26:31,974 --> 00:26:34,141
Could he be even
more of a dick?

493
00:26:34,143 --> 00:26:37,010
Hey. He's making an effort.

494
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,479
He wants this to work.
He wants us to be a family.

495
00:26:39,481 --> 00:26:42,549
Yeah, he says that, but that's not
what he does.

496
00:26:42,551 --> 00:26:45,519
Look, I know this isn't easy,
but you promised, remember?

497
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:47,654
You'd give it a try.

498
00:26:47,656 --> 00:26:51,124
I don't understand why I can't just
spend the summer with Dad.

499
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,962
Because you're with me.

500
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:08,242
Hey, buddy, the cooler's not going
to get to the car by itself.

501
00:28:23,986 --> 00:28:26,054
Good morning, sweetheart.

502
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:30,024
Do you want some breakfast?

503
00:28:30,026 --> 00:28:31,659
No. I'm good.

504
00:28:42,305 --> 00:28:44,340
<i># Look up here</i>

Nothing less than
highest score I hope.

525
00:30:31,716 --> 00:30:33,883
I've got a reputation to protect.

00:30:34,618 --> 00:30:36,413
- Hey.
- Hey.

527
00:30:37,122 --> 00:30:40,290
Whenever's convenient for you,
we are open for business.

528
00:30:40,292 --> 00:30:42,826
Hey, Caitlin, I'm going on break.

529
00:30:42,828 --> 00:30:45,295
Cool. I got a great idea.

530
00:30:45,297 --> 00:30:47,664
Why not, I don't know,

531
00:30:47,666 --> 00:30:49,332
put on some pants.

532
00:30:49,334 --> 00:30:50,867
She's being coy.

533
00:30:50,869 --> 00:30:53,103
But she digs me.
Big time.

534
00:30:53,105 --> 00:30:56,206
Just a thought.
You know what? Scratch it.

535
00:30:56,208 --> 00:30:58,875
Just like that's professional.

536
00:30:58,877 --> 00:31:00,443
See what I did there?

537
00:31:00,445 --> 00:31:03,313
I manipulated her with
my sexual charisma.

538
00:31:03,315 --> 00:31:04,380
Yeah.

539
00:31:04,382 --> 00:31:06,049
Yeah.
It was clever as shit.

540
00:31:06,051 --> 00:31:07,550
Why don't you come down
from your apartment

541
00:31:07,552 --> 00:31:09,352
and actually manage this place?

542
00:31:09,354 --> 00:31:12,722
Why don't you come on up here
and we'll talk about politics?

543
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,463
Sweet ride.

544
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,534
Oh, it's not mine.

545
00:31:23,536 --> 00:31:25,002
Yeah, I figured.

546
00:31:27,339 --> 00:31:29,773
You were right, by the way.

547
00:31:29,775 --> 00:31:31,308
It is a hot summer.

548
00:31:32,677 --> 00:31:34,912
Yeah, I just call it like I see it.

549
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:41,552
I'm just waiting for my dad
to call me back.

550
00:31:41,554 --> 00:31:43,020
I don't want to be inside
because my mom

551
00:31:43,022 --> 00:31:45,356
just stares at me while
I'm on the phone.

552
00:31:45,358 --> 00:31:46,624
She's all freaked out

553
00:31:46,626 --> 00:31:49,293
that I'm gonna want to
live with him or whatever.

554
00:31:52,697 --> 00:31:54,365
My mom's the same way.

555
00:31:56,768 --> 00:31:57,835
See you.

556
00:32:00,672 --> 00:32:03,641
So, let me know if you have any
other observations

557
00:32:03,643 --> 00:32:05,476
on weather patterns.

558
00:32:05,478 --> 00:32:06,877
Will do.

559
00:32:17,556 --> 00:32:19,890
I'll check and see
if he's out front.

560
00:32:28,133 --> 00:32:29,233
I wonder where he is.

561
00:32:29,235 --> 00:32:30,367
Oh, he'll turn up.

562
00:32:30,369 --> 00:32:32,269
Have you seen my flip-flops?

563
00:33:17,617 --> 00:33:19,918
I thought we had a deal
about leaving notes.

564
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,152
Checking in.

565
00:33:22,588 --> 00:33:24,022
My mom and I do.

566
00:33:25,324 --> 00:33:27,859
You worried her. Again.

567
00:33:27,861 --> 00:33:29,928
I told her I'd wait up for you.

568
00:33:30,596 --> 00:33:32,030
Well, I'm here.

569
00:33:32,032 --> 00:33:34,466
Hey, Duncan?

570
00:33:34,468 --> 00:33:37,602
I'm not interested in talking to
the back of your head.

571
00:33:44,478 --> 00:33:46,444
If we're going to make this work,

572
00:33:47,013 --> 00:33:48,980
and it is "we,"

573
00:33:48,982 --> 00:33:52,718
then there has to be trust.
And respect. Am I right?

574
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,087
I think that's something
we both want.

575
00:33:56,957 --> 00:33:58,124
Fine.

576
00:33:58,126 --> 00:33:59,759
There you go, buddy.

577
00:34:12,906 --> 00:34:15,308
I'm afraid I'm going to
have to ask you to leave.

578
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:16,742
What?

579
00:34:16,744 --> 00:34:18,878
Yeah, you're going to have to take off.
I'm getting complaints.

580
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,415
You're having too much fun.
It's making everyone uncomfortable.

581
00:34:23,016 --> 00:34:24,283
Okay.

582
00:34:25,419 --> 00:34:27,019
Hey, hey! Whoa, whoa.

583
00:34:28,955 --> 00:34:30,489
I'm just kidding.

584
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:36,062
Wow. That wasn't
even my best stuff.

585
00:34:36,064 --> 00:34:37,496
Are you for real?

586
00:34:38,932 --> 00:34:42,368
I can tell you're in complete awe
of our picnic table.

587
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:43,836
It is one-of-a-kind

588
00:34:43,838 --> 00:34:45,905
except for the 200 other ones
here that are exactly like it.

589
00:34:45,907 --> 00:34:48,107
But there is more park
to be seen.

590
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:50,343
First things first.

591
00:34:50,345 --> 00:34:51,977
As much as I'm
a fan of Tuff Skins,

592
00:34:51,979 --> 00:34:54,580
we've got to get you a swimsuit.

593
00:34:54,582 --> 00:34:56,682
Seriously, when's the last time
you bought jeans?

594
00:34:56,684 --> 00:34:58,317
My mom buys my jeans.

595
00:34:58,319 --> 00:35:00,386
Good.
Always take things literally.

596
00:35:00,388 --> 00:35:03,923
How's that working out for you?
Does that get you laid?

597
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:11,898
Lewis, hook up my
man Duncan here

598
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,734
with one of our finest
rentals would you?

599
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,736
Some kid threw up
near Crazy Tubes.

600
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:19,206
Sexy. Let's try not to impress him
all at once. Huh?

601
00:35:19,208 --> 00:35:20,574
That will not be a challenge.

602
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:22,275
Lewis is kind of
over this place.

603
00:35:22,277 --> 00:35:23,710
I told you.
I'm not long for here.

604
00:35:23,712 --> 00:35:25,078
No, I remember that conversation.

605
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,115
In 2003, 5, 11, April.

606
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:30,250
Yesterday.

607
00:35:30,252 --> 00:35:32,652
Can't eat that now.
Your dirty mouth's been on it.

608
00:35:32,654 --> 00:35:33,954
Germophobe.

609
00:35:33,956 --> 00:35:36,490
I've just told you.
There are things I want to do.

610
00:35:36,492 --> 00:35:39,693
Prove it. Without thinking
rattle off three. Go!

611
00:35:39,695 --> 00:35:41,261
See New Mexico.
Invent something.

612
00:35:41,263 --> 00:35:42,562
Become a storm chaser.

613
00:35:42,564 --> 00:35:43,997
You had me until number three.

614
00:35:43,999 --> 00:35:45,565
I think you have to
go to school for that.

615
00:35:45,567 --> 00:35:47,467
"Look. There's a storm. "
"Where?" "Over there. " "Cool. "

616
00:35:47,469 --> 00:35:48,668
"Let's go get it. "
"Got it. "

617
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,936
He actually is.

618
00:35:49,938 --> 00:35:51,805
He's been studying meteorology
since pre-school.

619
00:35:51,807 --> 00:35:53,573
Don't let the Dahmer
glasses fool you.

620
00:35:53,575 --> 00:35:57,077
These don't have any mesh,
so you're going commando.

621
00:35:57,079 --> 00:35:59,813
Watch sitting.
Your junk will fall out.

622
00:35:59,815 --> 00:36:02,315
Found that out the hard way
at a birthday party.

623
00:36:02,317 --> 00:36:05,385
And like that you're impressed.
And grossed out.

624
00:36:05,387 --> 00:36:07,154
Bye Lewis.
Bye.

625
00:36:10,091 --> 00:36:12,826
Water Wizz Waterpark.
Built in the summer of '83,

626
00:36:12,828 --> 00:36:14,995
it's the last bastion of everything
that time period stood for.

627
00:36:14,997 --> 00:36:16,630
In fact, it was decreed
by its creator

628
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:18,432
that this place shall never age.

629
00:36:18,434 --> 00:36:19,900
On his deathbed, he said,

630
00:36:19,902 --> 00:36:21,101
"I don't want this place
re-painted or updated.

631
00:36:21,103 --> 00:36:22,569
"I don't even want
it brought up to code.

632
00:36:22,571 --> 00:36:24,371
"And the minute someone tries,
it needs to be destroyed. "

633
00:36:24,373 --> 00:36:27,207
We actually have a nuclear bomb
for just such an occasion.

634
00:36:27,209 --> 00:36:28,976
Bought it off the Russians.

635
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:31,979
Really? Still good with all that?
Even the Russian thing?

636
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,781
That's Cold War.
It's kind of dated.

637
00:36:33,783 --> 00:36:35,216
All right, that was a waste of a bit.

638
00:36:35,218 --> 00:36:37,001
- Hey.
- Hey.

639
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:39,220
Some kid threw up
near Crazy Tubes.

640
00:36:39,222 --> 00:36:42,256
What? Why is this the first I'm hearing
of this? Damn it, woman!

641
00:36:42,258 --> 00:36:43,958
Caitlin, Duncan.
Tony, Mary Beth.

642
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,294
Hi, Duncan. Also, I need
you to reorder more mats.

643
00:36:46,296 --> 00:36:47,662
Did it.

644
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:48,496
Finish the work schedule
for next week.

645
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:49,564
Did it.

646
00:36:49,566 --> 00:36:50,832
Change all the filters.

647
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:52,366
Done.

648
00:36:52,368 --> 00:36:53,734
You know, I'm going to check
all that stuff, right?

649
00:36:53,736 --> 00:36:55,236
Then, in that case,
I didn't do any of that.

650
00:36:55,238 --> 00:36:56,637
So, I'm doing it.

651
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:59,774
It's called delegation.
I read about it in a book about it.

652
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:02,376
That's the one
you wait for, my man.

653
00:37:02,378 --> 00:37:03,811
Oh, yeah.

654
00:37:03,813 --> 00:37:05,880
She looked back.
She likes me.

655
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,188
This is Devil's Peak. The largest
waterslide in a 50-mile radius.

656
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,624
Stretch out the tube, end to end.
13 football fields.

657
00:37:16,626 --> 00:37:17,859
Don't Google that for confirmation.

658
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:19,494
That fact predates technology.

659
00:37:19,496 --> 00:37:21,462
Owen, settle a debate for us.

660
00:37:21,464 --> 00:37:24,332
Hello, boys. Duncan, this is Vladimir,
Ishmael, and Ming Lee.

661
00:37:24,334 --> 00:37:25,466
Those aren't our names!

662
00:37:25,468 --> 00:37:26,934
Those are the names
I'm giving you, Vlady.

663
00:37:26,936 --> 00:37:28,870
These are my illegitimate sons.
They all have different mothers.

664
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:30,371
I'm trying to be a positive
influence in their lives.

665
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,773
Take them to Little League, Boys Club,
raising pandas to fight.

666
00:37:32,775 --> 00:37:34,275
Shut up, jackass!

667
00:37:34,277 --> 00:37:35,443
Cloud fencing, hooker retreats.

668
00:37:35,445 --> 00:37:37,778
Neil says that years ago
some kid figured out

669
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:40,147
how to pass someone on the
water slide. Is that true?

670
00:37:40,149 --> 00:37:41,282
He did!

671
00:37:41,284 --> 00:37:42,517
It's physically impossible, Neil!

672
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:44,619
You can't catch up to someone
and pass them!

673
00:37:44,621 --> 00:37:47,723
Actually, Ming Lee's right.
I was here when it happened.

674
00:37:47,725 --> 00:37:49,525
All right, then how'd he do it?

675
00:37:49,527 --> 00:37:51,393
It happened inside the tube.
So, no one really knows.

676
00:37:51,395 --> 00:37:53,328
Only the kid and the
person he passed.

677
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:56,064
And Jesus Christ, our lord.
But, he's a little hard to get a hold of.

678
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:57,432
He won't return my calls.

679
00:37:57,434 --> 00:38:00,302
We wore the same shirt to a party
and it got a little weird.

680
00:38:00,304 --> 00:38:01,703
Be serious!

681
00:38:01,705 --> 00:38:04,072
Don't interrupt him, Neil!
He's talking!

682
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:06,542
Guys, what happens in the tube
stays in the tube.

683
00:38:06,544 --> 00:38:08,877
That's just the law
of the park.

684
00:38:08,879 --> 00:38:11,446
Bullshit. We'll just ask the kid
how he did it.

685
00:38:11,448 --> 00:38:12,848
Be my guest if you can find him.

686
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:14,449
Last I heard he went into
a deep depression.

687
00:38:14,451 --> 00:38:15,717
The fame was too much.

688
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:18,220
He turned to cocaine
to escape the limelight.

689
00:38:18,222 --> 00:38:20,522
And eventually,
a life of male prostitution.

690
00:38:20,524 --> 00:38:22,925
Oh, no. Wait. There he is.
You got sober. You look good.

691
00:38:22,927 --> 00:38:24,026
Good for you!

692
00:38:24,028 --> 00:38:25,193
Screw you, Owen!

693
00:38:25,195 --> 00:38:26,528
Yeah, screw you, Owen.

694
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:27,963
I just said that, Neil!

695
00:38:27,965 --> 00:38:29,531
I'm being supportive!

696
00:38:29,533 --> 00:38:32,834
Actually, that crack-addled
male whore was me.

697
00:38:33,336 --> 00:38:34,403
Really?

698
00:38:34,405 --> 00:38:35,837
Wow!

699
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,306
Do you get comedy?

700
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:42,377
So, did he pass him by sliding up
the side of the tube?

701
00:38:42,379 --> 00:38:44,179
I'm not telling you.

702
00:38:44,181 --> 00:38:45,447
But I want to know!

703
00:38:45,449 --> 00:38:48,250
That's a good thing.
Don't die wondering.

704
00:38:48,252 --> 00:38:52,254
All right, Hot Rod,
what's happening?

705
00:38:52,256 --> 00:38:54,256
Some kid threw up
near Crazy Tubes.

706
00:38:54,258 --> 00:38:57,192
Wow! Pointless news travels fast.

707
00:38:57,194 --> 00:39:01,663
Can I get a special ride
"with benefits" for my man, Duncan?

708
00:39:02,332 --> 00:39:04,400
Yeah, hold on.

709
00:39:04,402 --> 00:39:06,502
This slide's out of order.

710
00:39:06,504 --> 00:39:07,971
Watch this.

711
00:39:07,973 --> 00:39:11,341
Yeah, you gotta use the other one.

712
00:39:11,343 --> 00:39:13,910
Actually, you know what?
I think it's back in order. Okay.

713
00:39:13,912 --> 00:39:15,612
Come on, step up, please.

714
00:39:15,614 --> 00:39:17,413
Okay. Hold on.

715
00:39:17,415 --> 00:39:19,215
Just hold there for a sec.

716
00:39:20,684 --> 00:39:21,784
Hold.

717
00:39:21,786 --> 00:39:24,087
This guy's an artist.
Watch and learn.

718
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:27,890
And you are holding.

719
00:39:31,161 --> 00:39:33,463
Still holding.

720
00:39:33,465 --> 00:39:36,899
All right, I think we're all set
to hold a little bit longer.

721
00:39:38,602 --> 00:39:41,104
Okay, step back a little bit.
Okay, step forward.

722
00:39:41,106 --> 00:39:43,840
Okay, stay there.
Step back. And hold.

723
00:39:44,808 --> 00:39:46,009
Okay.

724
00:39:46,011 --> 00:39:47,610
Look at him.
It's gorgeous.

725
00:39:47,612 --> 00:39:49,679
Just about ready to hold.

726
00:39:49,681 --> 00:39:51,080
Okay and go.

727
00:39:51,082 --> 00:39:52,515
Okay, go, go, go!

728
00:39:53,951 --> 00:39:55,485
Put your mat down.

729
00:40:19,043 --> 00:40:23,981
Oh, excuse me. I'm truly sorry.
I can't get my footing.

730
00:40:25,016 --> 00:40:26,917
Owen, come on!

731
00:40:26,919 --> 00:40:29,486
Oh, no!
It looks like you lost something.

732
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:33,457
You just had to take it too far.

733
00:40:33,925 --> 00:40:35,926
Too far!

734
00:40:35,928 --> 00:40:39,630
<i>Happy Fourth of July everyone.
In honor of America's birthday,</i>

735
00:40:39,632 --> 00:40:41,131
<i>the park will be closing early.</i>

736
00:40:41,133 --> 00:40:43,867
<i>But our doors reopen
at 10:00 a. m. tomorrow.</i>

737
00:40:43,869 --> 00:40:45,869
<i>Be sure to bring back
your tickets stubs</i>

738
00:40:45,871 --> 00:40:48,939
<i>to receive five dollars off
an all-day park pass.</i>

739
00:40:48,941 --> 00:40:53,477
<i>Have a safe and festive holiday
from all of us at Water Wizz.</i>

740
00:40:57,882 --> 00:41:00,350
Hey. What's up, cowboy?
You want a ride?

741
00:41:00,352 --> 00:41:01,752
No, thanks.
I've got my bike.

742
00:41:01,754 --> 00:41:03,487
Where are you staying?

743
00:41:03,489 --> 00:41:05,122
Over by the beach, on Hampton.

744
00:41:05,124 --> 00:41:07,991
That's far. And, people drive
like idiots on the Fourth.

745
00:41:07,993 --> 00:41:09,893
Throw your bike in the back.

746
00:41:10,662 --> 00:41:11,995
No. You don't have to.

747
00:41:11,997 --> 00:41:13,664
Come on.

748
00:41:13,666 --> 00:41:14,932
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

749
00:41:16,167 --> 00:41:17,668
No, it's too much trouble.

750
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,470
Duncan we've got to start having
faster conversations.

751
00:41:19,472 --> 00:41:21,371
Throw your bike in the back.

752
00:41:25,009 --> 00:41:27,111
I'd help you out but I got
my hands on the wheel.

753
00:41:27,113 --> 00:41:28,612
Giving you a ride.
I think that's enough.

754
00:41:28,614 --> 00:41:30,814
Where'd you get that?
The princess collection.

755
00:41:30,816 --> 00:41:32,983
Hey, easy, easy!

756
00:41:32,985 --> 00:41:35,719
The car's just the right
amount of shitty.

757
00:41:43,162 --> 00:41:45,263
So, what brought you
to the water park?

758
00:41:45,265 --> 00:41:49,901
Not many kids head our way when
the ocean's their backyard.

759
00:41:49,903 --> 00:41:53,004
I don't know. I guess there's not
much for me at home.

760
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:00,779
How long have you
been working there?

761
00:42:00,781 --> 00:42:03,982
Oh! The park?
I've always been there.

762
00:42:03,984 --> 00:42:07,585
Ever since I was
a small Cambodian child.

763
00:42:07,587 --> 00:42:10,021
Of course, that was after 'Nam.
I was in the shit.

764
00:42:10,023 --> 00:42:13,057
Then I joined the circus
to become a clown fighter.

765
00:42:13,059 --> 00:42:16,895
I know about 46 ways to kill a clown.
I hate clowns.

766
00:42:16,897 --> 00:42:19,531
I'm kidding except for the part
where I really do hate them.

767
00:42:21,768 --> 00:42:23,168
Nice teamwork.

768
00:42:24,937 --> 00:42:26,104
I'm exhausted.

769
00:42:26,106 --> 00:42:27,172
Thanks for the ride.

770
00:42:27,174 --> 00:42:29,140
Hey, thanks for the memories.

771
00:42:33,746 --> 00:42:35,613
Hey, Evel Knievel.

772
00:42:35,615 --> 00:42:37,715
You're probably busy
or not interested,

773
00:42:37,717 --> 00:42:40,552
but I need somebody
to be a floater at the park.

774
00:42:40,554 --> 00:42:42,854
You know, do some odd jobs,
clean up some vomit.

775
00:42:42,856 --> 00:42:44,189
What do you think?

776
00:42:44,191 --> 00:42:47,058
Definitely.
Awesome. Yeah.

777
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:50,228
If it's too much trouble,
you totally don't have to, but...

778
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:51,529
If you need someone...

779
00:42:51,531 --> 00:42:52,797
Duncan.

780
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,932
Yes.

781
00:42:53,934 --> 00:42:57,770
There you go.
Tomorrow. 9:00 a. m.

782
00:43:09,783 --> 00:43:11,517
Who was that you were with?

783
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:12,751
Just a friend.

784
00:43:12,753 --> 00:43:13,953
A friend who drives?

785
00:43:13,955 --> 00:43:15,154
Mom.

786
00:43:15,156 --> 00:43:16,555
What's his name?

787
00:43:16,557 --> 00:43:17,756
Owen.

788
00:43:17,758 --> 00:43:18,858
And how do you know him?

789
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,359
Mom, he's just a friend.

790
00:43:20,361 --> 00:43:22,127
A friend with a license?

791
00:43:22,129 --> 00:43:23,796
Well, you should bring him by.

792
00:43:23,798 --> 00:43:25,097
Okay? I'd like to meet him.

793
00:43:25,099 --> 00:43:26,232
Fine.

794
00:43:26,234 --> 00:43:28,400
Whoa. I'm not done.

795
00:43:28,402 --> 00:43:30,502
We don't stay out all night
and disappear all day.

796
00:43:30,504 --> 00:43:32,071
Do you understand me?

797
00:43:32,073 --> 00:43:34,473
I could say the same to you.

798
00:43:34,941 --> 00:43:37,142
What?

799
00:43:37,144 --> 00:43:39,278
I want you to make
an appearance at Betty's.

800
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,346
Okay.

801
00:43:40,348 --> 00:43:41,413
I'm serious.

802
00:43:41,415 --> 00:43:42,681
Okay!

803
00:43:52,092 --> 00:43:54,827
Susanna! Susanna!
We're hanging over here.

804
00:43:54,829 --> 00:43:57,463
Come on. Grab a cup,
we're playing quarters!

805
00:43:57,465 --> 00:43:58,931
Maybe in a minute.

806
00:44:09,175 --> 00:44:11,744
This is empty.
And, that's just not right.

807
00:44:13,347 --> 00:44:14,681
Hey, Duncan.

808
00:44:14,683 --> 00:44:15,949
You should hang out with Peter.

809
00:44:15,951 --> 00:44:17,751
He's playing under
one of these tables.

810
00:44:17,753 --> 00:44:19,352
- Peter!
- What?

811
00:44:19,354 --> 00:44:20,921
There you go.

812
00:44:20,923 --> 00:44:23,456
Do you want me to make
you a plate of food?

813
00:44:23,458 --> 00:44:25,058
No, I can do it.

814
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:27,694
Be sure to get some clams.
They were all my doing this year.

815
00:44:27,696 --> 00:44:30,497
Bring your food over here
and eat with me, okay?

816
00:44:31,565 --> 00:44:32,799
Okay.

817
00:44:36,337 --> 00:44:40,006
Charlie, don't do your "Dead" dance
so close to the fire!

818
00:44:40,008 --> 00:44:43,543
I don't need my first born bursting
into flames at my party.

819
00:44:43,545 --> 00:44:45,178
What's up, Peter?

820
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:46,346
Hey, man.

821
00:44:46,348 --> 00:44:47,681
How's the battle going?

822
00:44:47,683 --> 00:44:49,649
Luke and Leia are hooking up.

823
00:44:50,851 --> 00:44:53,453
You know they're
brother and sister, right?

824
00:44:54,522 --> 00:44:55,689
Yeah.

825
00:44:56,757 --> 00:44:57,891
Cool.

826
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:01,061
I'd avoid the clams if I were you.

827
00:45:01,063 --> 00:45:04,431
They're one of the many casualties
of my father's absence.

828
00:45:05,132 --> 00:45:06,199
Oh.

829
00:45:08,135 --> 00:45:10,603
Just because your mom
will see my plate.

830
00:45:13,307 --> 00:45:14,774
It's your funeral.

831
00:45:16,277 --> 00:45:17,677
Oh, Charlie!

832
00:45:20,282 --> 00:45:22,916
Looks like my brother
just made another sale.

833
00:45:28,389 --> 00:45:29,956
We'll be right back.

834
00:45:36,431 --> 00:45:37,798
Hey. Peter.

835
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:38,866
Yeah.

836
00:45:38,868 --> 00:45:40,101
You want to go chase ghost crabs?

837
00:45:40,103 --> 00:45:42,336
Oh, hell, yeah!

838
00:45:42,338 --> 00:45:44,005
Duncan?
Any interest?

839
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:45,206
Yeah. Sure.

840
00:45:57,219 --> 00:45:59,153
When I was younger,

841
00:45:59,155 --> 00:46:02,490
my dad used to bring me down
here to do this all the time.

842
00:46:02,492 --> 00:46:06,660
He'd fill my head with all these useless
facts about ghost crabs.

843
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:11,599
Like, did you know
they're omnivorous?

844
00:46:11,601 --> 00:46:15,169
Basically, they eat
both animals and vegetables.

845
00:46:17,572 --> 00:46:20,941
My mom jokes,
"Leave it to your dad

846
00:46:20,943 --> 00:46:24,345
"to be interested in a creature
that goes both ways. "

847
00:46:29,618 --> 00:46:32,720
So, do you want me
to keep talking

848
00:46:32,722 --> 00:46:35,356
or are you going to say
something eventually?

849
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:40,361
My mom doesn't smoke pot.

850
00:46:45,067 --> 00:46:47,168
That's the power of this place.

851
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:49,204
It's like spring break for adults.

852
00:46:52,608 --> 00:46:55,143
That's what I think
really kills my mom.

853
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,645
Not that my dad left,

854
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:59,214
but that he's got someone
and she doesn't.

855
00:47:01,784 --> 00:47:04,519
So, is your dad seeing anybody?

856
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:06,421
Yeah, she's a lot younger.

857
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:07,856
Classic.

858
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:10,192
They're just getting
situated in San Diego.

859
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:12,694
You know? New place.

860
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:15,030
So, he says it's not
a great time right now.

861
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:17,265
But I'm going to
go visit him soon

862
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:19,501
once he gets settled.

863
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,536
It's supposed to be
awesome out there.

864
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:23,839
California.
That's cool.

865
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,073
Yeah.

866
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:37,085
So, where is it you go?

867
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:38,520
Go where?

868
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,422
On your sexy, pink cruiser?

869
00:47:42,058 --> 00:47:43,525
Nowhere.

870
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:44,960
Oh. I see.

871
00:47:45,595 --> 00:47:47,028
No, I... I just...

872
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,764
It's okay.
Let it be yours.

873
00:47:52,401 --> 00:47:53,602
Good night.

874
00:47:54,737 --> 00:47:56,138
Yeah, good night.

875
00:48:25,169 --> 00:48:26,602
Oh, I see.

876
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:29,839
Just not this summer?

877
00:48:44,188 --> 00:48:45,354
Who cares?

878
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:48,891
We're never gonna die.

879
00:48:52,162 --> 00:48:54,063
You were gone
that whole time

880
00:48:54,065 --> 00:48:57,400
and you only brought
the marshmallows?

881
00:48:57,968 --> 00:48:59,435
Joan has the rest.

882
00:49:07,044 --> 00:49:08,611
I can't get up!

883
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:18,254
Here you go.

884
00:49:33,171 --> 00:49:34,871
Don't let them burn.

885
00:49:38,443 --> 00:49:39,776
I know I keep asking you.

886
00:49:39,778 --> 00:49:41,778
But when do we get
new employee T-shirts?

887
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:44,781
Two years from yesterday.

888
00:49:44,783 --> 00:49:47,884
'Cause this one makes me
self-conscious about my body.

889
00:49:49,287 --> 00:49:50,954
You disappoint me, kid.

890
00:49:50,956 --> 00:49:53,757
You're late! You planning
on making a habit of this?

891
00:49:53,759 --> 00:49:54,825
What?

892
00:49:54,827 --> 00:49:56,093
You're fired.

893
00:49:56,095 --> 00:49:57,694
But I just...

894
00:49:57,696 --> 00:50:00,464
You make a valid point.
Welcome back. With benefits.

895
00:50:00,466 --> 00:50:03,133
You waste an exorbitant amount of time.
Do you know that?

896
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:04,534
Suit up.

897
00:50:04,536 --> 00:50:05,702
You don't look too pumped.

898
00:50:05,704 --> 00:50:08,305
Come on, let's get pumped!

899
00:50:08,307 --> 00:50:11,275
<i># This is the place
where dreams are made</i>

900
00:50:11,277 --> 00:50:12,943
<i># Or destroyed</i>

901
00:50:12,945 --> 00:50:17,414
<i># Depends on how you feel
about working at a water park #</i>

902
00:50:17,416 --> 00:50:20,584
We have a situation
over at Harpoon Lagoon.

903
00:50:20,586 --> 00:50:22,019
Is it a homicide?

904
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,055
Yeah. It's a homicide.

905
00:50:25,057 --> 00:50:26,923
I knew this day would come.

906
00:50:29,761 --> 00:50:31,561
I'm gonna stay here

907
00:50:31,563 --> 00:50:34,298
in the booth no one comes to.

908
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:50,548
Oh. No blood?

909
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:52,350
They grabbed some cardboard
from the snack shack

910
00:50:52,352 --> 00:50:54,018
and started going to town.

911
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:56,688
Mostly B-boying. Power,
Abstract, Blowup, Flavor.

912
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:57,922
Mad moves though.

913
00:50:57,924 --> 00:51:00,091
Jackhammer, Applejacks,
Coin drops,

914
00:51:00,093 --> 00:51:02,927
rubber bands, Turtles, 1990s.

915
00:51:02,929 --> 00:51:04,195
Any Jookin'? Buckin'?

916
00:51:04,197 --> 00:51:05,697
No. Not this far from Memphis.

917
00:51:05,699 --> 00:51:08,232
Someone needs to get in there
and take their cardboard away.

918
00:51:08,234 --> 00:51:09,767
It's getting too congested.

919
00:51:09,769 --> 00:51:11,235
You heard the lady.

920
00:51:11,237 --> 00:51:12,537
No. I...

921
00:51:12,539 --> 00:51:15,373
No. Owen.
You've gotta do this.

922
00:51:15,375 --> 00:51:18,042
Duncan's gonna take care of it.
He's got it. Aren't you?

923
00:51:18,044 --> 00:51:19,711
But it's my first day.

924
00:51:19,713 --> 00:51:22,413
But it's your first day?
Worst-case scenario.

925
00:51:22,415 --> 00:51:25,216
They beat you up and you're
horribly disfigured.

926
00:51:32,725 --> 00:51:34,625
Hey. Look at me.

927
00:51:34,627 --> 00:51:36,961
You've got your shirt on now.
You're official.

928
00:51:36,963 --> 00:51:38,863
They're gonna listen to you.

929
00:51:44,203 --> 00:51:46,571
I'll be right here.
I'll step in.

930
00:52:26,746 --> 00:52:27,880
What the hell!

931
00:52:27,882 --> 00:52:28,947
I gotta take your cardboard.

932
00:52:28,949 --> 00:52:31,049
What did you say?

933
00:52:31,051 --> 00:52:33,085
I gotta take your cardboard.

934
00:52:36,723 --> 00:52:38,123
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

935
00:52:38,125 --> 00:52:40,592
You know what?
Show us your moves.

936
00:52:40,594 --> 00:52:44,163
You want the cardboard?
Then show us your moves.

937
00:52:44,165 --> 00:52:46,298
But I don't...
I can't...

938
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:51,370
Come on.

939
00:52:53,473 --> 00:52:55,174
Let's see what you got.

940
00:53:07,187 --> 00:53:10,155
Okay. Okay.
That's enough.

941
00:53:10,157 --> 00:53:12,524
Go ahead. You can take
the cardboard.

942
00:53:12,526 --> 00:53:16,329
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold up. I don't think so.

943
00:53:16,331 --> 00:53:17,831
We are not done here.

944
00:53:17,833 --> 00:53:20,633
You need to show me what you got.
Let's get down.

945
00:53:20,635 --> 00:53:21,935
Do what I do.

946
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:37,650
Nice.

947
00:53:52,132 --> 00:53:54,334
Hey, hey, hey!
Spin on your head!

948
00:54:00,941 --> 00:54:02,342
Look at that.

949
00:54:11,719 --> 00:54:13,486
Stick it, man! Stick it!

950
00:54:19,793 --> 00:54:22,028
Nice moves, Pop 'n Lock.

951
00:54:27,134 --> 00:54:28,268
The man's got some soul.

952
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:29,669
You got lucky.

953
00:54:31,705 --> 00:54:36,477
<i># Live, baby, live

00:54:53,062 --> 00:54:54,161
Nowhere.

959
00:54:54,163 --> 00:54:55,796
That's a long time
to be nowhere.

960
00:54:55,798 --> 00:54:57,865
Well, that's where I was.

961
00:54:59,568 --> 00:55:01,802
Sorry, this slide's out of order.

962
00:55:03,204 --> 00:55:04,905
It's back in order now.

963
00:55:06,308 --> 00:55:07,508
Hold there.

964
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:09,810
Hold.

965
00:55:10,845 --> 00:55:11,979
Shane.

966
00:55:13,515 --> 00:55:14,715
Duncan!

Hold on.

973
00:55:39,407 --> 00:55:40,541
Okay, go ahead.

Now!

978
00:56:05,568 --> 00:56:06,735
What happened?

979
00:56:06,737 --> 00:56:07,869
I'm sorry. They rushed me.

980
00:56:07,871 --> 00:56:10,805
They said it was for
the good of science.

981
00:56:10,807 --> 00:56:12,807
Hey! Are you guys okay?

982
00:56:12,809 --> 00:56:15,944
No! We're not okay, dumbass!
We're stuck!

983
00:56:15,946 --> 00:56:17,579
Did he just call me a dumbass?

984
00:56:17,581 --> 00:56:19,280
Yeah.

985
00:56:19,282 --> 00:56:21,950
Not sure how I'm the dumbass
in this scenario.

986
00:56:21,952 --> 00:56:24,285
I told you we shouldn't all
go at the same time!

987
00:56:24,287 --> 00:56:25,787
I thought it would work!

988
00:56:25,789 --> 00:56:28,590
Shut up, Neil!
Shut up! Neil!

989
00:56:31,861 --> 00:56:33,395
Okay, listen up!

990
00:56:33,929 --> 00:56:35,430
I need a hero.

991
00:56:35,432 --> 00:56:38,566
I'm holding out for a hero
till the end of the night.

992
00:56:38,568 --> 00:56:40,635
He's gotta be strong.

993
00:56:40,637 --> 00:56:42,837
And he's gotta be fast.

994
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:45,407
And he's gotta be
fresh from the fight.

995
00:56:49,145 --> 00:56:52,147
<i>Anybody? Footloose?
Bonnie Tyler song?</i>

996

00:56:54,351 --> 00:56:55,617
Nothing?

998
00:56:55,619 --> 00:56:57,118
Wow.

999
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:59,587
How about the remake?
Anybody see the remake?

1000
00:57:02,058 --> 00:57:04,192
I need someone to throw
himself down the tube

1001
00:57:04,194 --> 00:57:07,162
and knock some kids loose.
Anybody? Any volunteers?

1002
00:57:08,597 --> 00:57:09,799
I'll do it.

1003
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:10,866
Great! Come on up here.

1004
00:57:10,868 --> 00:57:12,334
The rest of you,

1005
00:57:12,336 --> 00:57:14,003
you're all dead to me.

1006
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:17,540
Hey. What's your name?

1007
00:57:17,542 --> 00:57:18,874
Malcolm.

1008
00:57:18,876 --> 00:57:20,776
We're gonna have to get you
going fast there, Mack.

1009
00:57:20,778 --> 00:57:22,111
I got this.

1010
00:57:22,113 --> 00:57:23,946
Owen, I don't know
if that's a good idea.

1011
00:57:23,948 --> 00:57:26,782
What if we just turn off the water?
They could get their footing.

1012
00:57:26,784 --> 00:57:28,050
Let's call that Plan B.

1013
00:57:28,052 --> 00:57:29,485
Guys, I'm not going to lie to you.

1014
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:30,886
This is probably going to hurt.

1015
00:57:30,888 --> 00:57:32,688
What's going to hurt who?

1016
00:57:34,458 --> 00:57:35,524
One.

1017
00:57:35,526 --> 00:57:36,792
Two.

1018
00:57:36,794 --> 00:57:38,127
Remember you signed a waiver.
You can't sue us.

1019
00:57:38,129 --> 00:57:39,328
Three!

1020
00:57:45,535 --> 00:57:46,702
What's happening?

1021
00:57:46,704 --> 00:57:47,937
I can't see!

1022
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:08,624
Oh, my God! Vladimir. Ishmael, Ming Lee!
I thought I lost you!

1023
00:58:12,362 --> 00:58:13,963
Thank God you're alive.

1024
00:58:13,965 --> 00:58:15,364
That was awesome!

1025
00:58:17,033 --> 00:58:18,501
You survived.

1026
00:58:18,503 --> 00:58:21,170
Whoa. Whoa. We aren't done
with this now. Thank you.

1027
00:58:21,172 --> 00:58:23,005
Gentlemen, no! No!

1028
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:24,974
What are you doing?

1029
00:58:24,976 --> 00:58:27,811
Having fun. It's all good.
Nobody got hurt.

1030
00:58:27,813 --> 00:58:30,080
It's not all good!
You can't do that.

1031
00:58:30,082 --> 00:58:32,649
That is the reason that places
like this get shut down.

1032
00:58:32,651 --> 00:58:34,918
Is it me or is she
very sexy right now?

1033
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:37,087
She's certainly got my attention.

1034
00:58:38,356 --> 00:58:39,856
You're an impressive man.

1035
00:58:39,858 --> 00:58:41,525
I want to be you when I grow up.

1036
00:58:41,527 --> 00:58:44,261
I get so tired of this guy.
Aren't you tired?

1037
00:58:44,263 --> 00:58:46,763
Aren't you sick of yourself?

1038
00:58:46,765 --> 00:58:49,900
I'm sick of it! I'm sick of who
I am around you.

1039
00:58:49,902 --> 00:58:52,569
I'm sick of having to be this person.
I'm not this person.

1040
00:58:52,571 --> 00:58:53,970
I'm just messing around with you.

1041
00:58:53,972 --> 00:58:55,238
No!

1042
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:58,642
That's why this doesn't happen.

1043
00:59:00,678 --> 00:59:02,445
This is just a job now.

1044
00:59:05,283 --> 00:59:07,684
I wish this wasn't just a job.

1045
00:59:13,658 --> 00:59:15,659
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

1046
00:59:15,661 --> 00:59:17,460
It's okay.
It's my fault.

1047
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:20,030
Don't worry about it.

1048
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:56,968
The soup needs a little longer.

1049
00:59:56,970 --> 01:00:01,405
There's a 1:30 and a 3:30.
We could see one of those.

1050
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:05,776
Let's stay in. Do something we
can all do together. As a family.

1051
01:00:05,778 --> 01:00:07,612
We can see a movie as a family.

1052
01:00:07,614 --> 01:00:10,915
We could grab Kip and Joan
and make an evening out of it.

1053
01:00:10,917 --> 01:00:13,885
I don't feel like hanging out
with Kip and Joan.

1054
01:00:13,887 --> 01:00:16,354
I feel like hanging
out with all of you.

1055
01:00:21,393 --> 01:00:22,493
Okay.

1056
01:00:27,432 --> 01:00:30,468
It says appropriate
for people four to eight.

1057
01:00:30,470 --> 01:00:32,069
So, we're good.

1058
01:00:34,206 --> 01:00:36,607
What color gingerbread character
do you want to be? Trent?

1059
01:00:36,609 --> 01:00:38,309
Surprise me.

1060
01:00:40,812 --> 01:00:42,380
I have to be yellow!

1061
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,955
Oh, look, you can
take the shortcut there.

1062
01:00:50,957 --> 01:00:53,524
No. He can't do that.

1063
01:00:53,526 --> 01:00:54,959
Yes, he can.
He crosses the bridge.

1064
01:00:54,961 --> 01:00:56,060
This is so stupid.

1065
01:00:56,062 --> 01:00:57,595
No, you're at the shortcut.
So, take it.

1066
01:00:57,597 --> 01:01:01,098
Okay. Hold on,
hold on. Okay. Here we go.

1067
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:06,071
"Shortcuts. If your playing piece
lands by exact count

1068
01:01:06,073 --> 01:01:09,474
"on the purple space
below Gumdrop Pass,

1069
01:01:09,476 --> 01:01:10,909
"then you can take the shortcut. "

1070
01:01:10,911 --> 01:01:12,477
"Exact count. "

1071
01:01:12,479 --> 01:01:13,979
He picked a card
with a blue square

1072
01:01:13,981 --> 01:01:15,981
so he has to go
to the blue square.

1073
01:01:15,983 --> 01:01:17,916
I don't think it matters.

1074
01:01:17,918 --> 01:01:20,452
If it didn't matter, they wouldn't put
it in the directions.

1075
01:01:20,454 --> 01:01:22,421
We can fudge the rule.

1076
01:01:22,423 --> 01:01:28,126
If you're gonna play this way,
then, I'm just going like that.

1077
01:01:28,128 --> 01:01:31,997
All the way past Molasses
Swamp and I win.

1078
01:01:31,999 --> 01:01:33,565
No rules.
I win the game.

1079
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:34,933
Fine. We'll play the way
you're supposed to play.

1080
01:01:34,935 --> 01:01:36,568
Duncan, move back to
your correct place.

1081
01:01:36,570 --> 01:01:38,036
Why don't we just
play by the rules?

1082
01:01:38,038 --> 01:01:40,305
And then everybody's
gonna be happy. Okay?

1083
01:01:40,307 --> 01:01:41,640
I already did.

1084
01:01:42,809 --> 01:01:44,710
Great.

1085
01:01:44,712 --> 01:01:46,712
Now, take my turn. I'm going to set
the table for lunch.

1086
01:01:46,714 --> 01:01:48,814
No. Wait.
You have to do it.

1087
01:01:48,816 --> 01:01:50,749
Duncan can move for me.

1088
01:01:50,751 --> 01:01:53,218
No. You're the one who wanted to play.
So play your turn.

1089
01:02:01,327 --> 01:02:02,461
Purple.

1090
01:02:06,632 --> 01:02:08,467
It's two.

1091
01:02:09,702 --> 01:02:12,504
You have to move
two purple squares.

1092
01:02:14,807 --> 01:02:15,874
Sorry.

1093
01:02:24,985 --> 01:02:26,586
There.

1094
01:02:26,588 --> 01:02:29,455
And I've landed by exact count,
at the shortcut

1095
01:02:29,457 --> 01:02:32,325
so, I am going to take the
Gumdrop Mountain Pass.

1096
01:02:36,497 --> 01:02:38,131
See? You're way ahead now.

1097
01:02:38,133 --> 01:02:39,866
<i>It's Candy Land, Trent.</i>

1098
01:02:48,342 --> 01:02:50,009
It's your turn, Steph.

1099
01:02:57,785 --> 01:03:00,319
<i>It's fucking Candy Land!</i>

1100
01:04:01,816 --> 01:04:03,382
- Hey.
- Hey.

1101
01:04:04,386 --> 01:04:06,086
What are you doing here?
It's your day off.

1102
01:04:06,088 --> 01:04:09,957
I figured it rained yesterday,
so I thought I could make it up.

1103
01:04:11,292 --> 01:04:12,526
Why are you?

1104
01:04:14,229 --> 01:04:17,965
Thought I'd open the place up.
See what all the fuss is about.

1105
01:04:25,507 --> 01:04:27,608
Your shirt's inside out.

1106
01:04:31,045 --> 01:04:33,914
Come on, how sexy
does authority look on me?

1107
01:04:33,916 --> 01:04:35,516
Yeah. You love it.

1108
01:04:36,784 --> 01:04:39,653
So you thought
you'd just open up?

1109
01:04:40,922 --> 01:04:42,890
What're you?
Some kind of wise guy?

1110
01:04:42,892 --> 01:04:45,292
I'm still your superior.
A cup of coffee in my hand.

1111
01:04:45,294 --> 01:04:46,426
Two minutes.

1112
01:04:46,428 --> 01:04:47,694
Okay.

1113
01:04:47,696 --> 01:04:49,696
We don't sell coffee.
Burn!

1114
01:04:51,132 --> 01:04:52,366
Yeah, we do.

1115
01:04:54,169 --> 01:04:55,537
Says you.

1116
01:04:55,539 --> 01:04:58,106
And by the way,
we put the chairs in rows.

1117
01:05:01,377 --> 01:05:03,111
I know that.

1118
01:05:03,113 --> 01:05:04,879
It's a ten-step process.

1119
01:05:09,285 --> 01:05:12,353
So, this is where you run off to?

1120
01:05:12,355 --> 01:05:13,855
Hey.

1121
01:05:13,857 --> 01:05:15,523
What are you doing here?

1122
01:05:15,525 --> 01:05:19,060
I followed you earlier.
Then went and got my stuff.

1123
01:05:19,062 --> 01:05:21,629
What happened to
"let it be yours?"

1124
01:05:21,631 --> 01:05:23,698
I held out as long as I could.

1125
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:25,200
It's on.
Wow.

1126
01:05:25,202 --> 01:05:26,301
It's way on.

1127
01:05:26,303 --> 01:05:27,535
Duncan.

1128
01:05:27,537 --> 01:05:30,371
Does your mom know
that you work here?

1129
01:05:30,373 --> 01:05:31,706
No.

1130
01:05:32,608 --> 01:05:34,042
Nice.

1131
01:05:34,044 --> 01:05:35,777
<i>Report to the Administrative Offices
International.</i>

1132
01:05:35,779 --> 01:05:36,978
<i>Duncan, please report</i>

1133
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:38,613
<i>to the Administrative
Offices International.</i>

1134
01:05:38,615 --> 01:05:39,981
<i>I have to have to
announce it over the PA</i>

1135
01:05:39,983 --> 01:05:41,683
<i>as my voice won't
carry that far.</i>

1136
01:05:41,685 --> 01:05:43,218
<i>My throat suffered
major damage</i>

1137
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:45,453
<i>during an intense make-out session
with Lewis' mom.</i>

1138
01:05:45,455 --> 01:05:47,956
<i>She has a forked tongue
and a touch of the herpes.</i>

1139
01:05:47,958 --> 01:05:50,858
I don't have a mom.
I have two dads. In your face.

1140
01:05:52,828 --> 01:05:54,963
Hold on a second.

1141
01:05:54,965 --> 01:05:58,666
<i>Please. Hurry up. This is pressing,
pressing. Urgent.</i>

1142
01:05:58,668 --> 01:06:01,035
I can't tell you how pressing.
You can't fathom how pressing.

1143
01:06:01,037 --> 01:06:04,072
How's it going? What's up?
Did you need something?

1144
01:06:04,074 --> 01:06:05,240
No.

1145
01:06:06,275 --> 01:06:08,209
Who's that, big guy?

1146
01:06:08,211 --> 01:06:09,510
Just a girl.

1147
01:06:10,614 --> 01:06:12,514
You stallion, you.

1148
01:06:12,516 --> 01:06:15,451
I don't know.
She's older than me.

1149
01:06:15,453 --> 01:06:18,053
So what are you doing
over here talking to us

1150
01:06:18,055 --> 01:06:22,358
and not over there,
sealing the deal with that cougar?

1151
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:25,828
Well, maybe, Roddy, if you guys hadn't
called me over here.

1152
01:06:29,766 --> 01:06:31,033
<i>Return to your lady friend.</i>

1153
01:06:31,035 --> 01:06:32,935
<i>Duncan, please return
to your lady friend.</i>

1154
01:06:32,937 --> 01:06:34,570
<i>Please let her know</i>

1155
01:06:34,572 --> 01:06:36,171
<i>that this conversation
was entirely about her.</i>

1156
01:06:36,173 --> 01:06:39,008
<i>In other news,
this is very awkward for you.</i>

1157
01:06:41,378 --> 01:06:44,580
Water Wizz Waterpark.
It was built in the summer of '83.

1158
01:06:44,582 --> 01:06:46,515
The creator never wanted
the place to change.

1159
01:06:46,517 --> 01:06:48,017
So, on his deathbed, he says,

1160
01:06:48,019 --> 01:06:50,753
"I don't want this place
to be up to date or repaired.

1161
01:06:50,755 --> 01:06:52,521
"I don't even want it
brought up to code.

1162
01:06:52,523 --> 01:06:56,258
"The minute someone tries,
it needs to be destroyed. "

1163
01:06:56,260 --> 01:06:59,028
Huh. I didn't get
that joke quite as fast.

1164
01:06:59,763 --> 01:07:01,196
Hey, Pop 'n Lock.

1165
01:07:02,899 --> 01:07:04,366
That you?

1166
01:07:04,368 --> 01:07:05,968
Don't worry about it.

1167
01:07:44,608 --> 01:07:47,177
Thanks a lot for
ditching me, bitch.

1168
01:07:47,179 --> 01:07:49,045
I wasn't aware we had plans.

1169
01:07:49,047 --> 01:07:51,514
I wasn't aware that
you two had plans.

1170
01:07:51,516 --> 01:07:52,949
I'm sorry.

1171
01:07:52,951 --> 01:07:56,319
Look. I have got a ton of stuff
going on in my life right now.

1172
01:07:56,321 --> 01:07:59,556
So, it would have been nice
to have a friend.

1173
01:08:09,166 --> 01:08:10,834
Dinner's almost ready.

1174
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:17,941
Bye.

1175
01:08:17,943 --> 01:08:19,342
See you.

1176
01:08:35,459 --> 01:08:38,261
No use in waiting.
Let's eat.

1177
01:08:48,106 --> 01:08:51,509
How's Chad, Steph?

1178
01:08:52,244 --> 01:08:53,711
We broke up.

1179
01:08:55,514 --> 01:08:56,714
Oh...

1180
01:08:57,315 --> 01:08:58,816
I'm sorry.

1181
01:09:37,022 --> 01:09:39,123
What do you want me to say?
Pam?

1182
01:09:40,091 --> 01:09:44,261
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.

1183
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:46,831
It got late. I didn't call 'cause
I didn't want to wake you up.

1184
01:09:46,833 --> 01:09:48,732
Just tell me.

1185
01:09:48,734 --> 01:09:50,034
What?

1186
01:09:50,036 --> 01:09:51,702
If there's something
I should know.

1187
01:09:51,704 --> 01:09:54,672
I was with Kip on his boat all day.
We lost track of the time.

1188
01:09:54,674 --> 01:09:57,641
Don't make me feel crazy.
I've been through this before.

1189
01:09:57,643 --> 01:10:00,077
No. Just stop.

1190
01:10:00,079 --> 01:10:03,147
Stop it. Okay?
I'm right here.

1191
01:10:03,149 --> 01:10:04,583
Always have been.

1192
01:10:08,221 --> 01:10:10,388
We're in this together.
Remember?

1193
01:10:27,807 --> 01:10:29,574
Good morning.

1194
01:10:29,576 --> 01:10:32,143
I hope you're hungry.
I've already made too many pancakes.

1195
01:10:32,145 --> 01:10:33,445
Where was he?

1196
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:37,549
He was with Kip.
But he's here now.

1197
01:10:42,555 --> 01:10:43,855
Good morning, buddy.

1198
01:10:43,857 --> 01:10:46,658
Hey, hey, hey.
We don't say good morning?

1199
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:49,394
Welcome home.

1200
01:10:57,670 --> 01:10:59,804
How about this spread, huh?

1201
01:10:59,806 --> 01:11:03,508
How did Joan find the time
to order take-out?

1202
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:08,647
And if there's one thing that
travels really well, it's fried food.

1203
01:11:08,649 --> 01:11:11,316
I must get Joan's recipe
for Big Daddy's menu.

1204
01:11:11,751 --> 01:11:13,418
Touche.

1205
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:15,987
Hey. Is everyone
having a good time?

1206
01:11:15,989 --> 01:11:18,089
I see you got your food.
Mm-hmm.

1207
01:11:18,091 --> 01:11:19,624
Pam, I don't know
what I was thinking.

1208
01:11:19,626 --> 01:11:22,328
I should have had
you cater the party.

1209
01:11:22,330 --> 01:11:25,698
Well, at least this way,
you'll have lots of leftovers.

1210
01:11:27,635 --> 01:11:28,834
New look?

1211
01:11:28,836 --> 01:11:30,269
No, I just have...

1212
01:11:31,004 --> 01:11:32,705
I always do this.

1213
01:11:32,707 --> 01:11:34,874
Mr. Ramsey, you have
been avoiding me all night.

1214
01:11:34,876 --> 01:11:36,475
I'm not having it.
Not tonight.

1215
01:11:36,477 --> 01:11:38,277
Oh, no.

1216
01:11:38,279 --> 01:11:40,146
Out on the dance floor. Come on.
You know you want to.

1217
01:11:40,148 --> 01:11:42,214
Don't look so glum, everybody.

1218
01:11:43,317 --> 01:11:45,084
All right.
I'll be back.

1219
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:52,358
Joan found herself a victim, huh?

1220
01:11:53,860 --> 01:11:57,763
Kip, I expect to be inviting myself
on your boat again.

1221
01:11:57,765 --> 01:11:59,599
And when should I
plan on doing that?

1222
01:11:59,601 --> 01:12:03,336
I would like nothing more than to
get you on my boat in a bikini.

1223
01:12:05,706 --> 01:12:07,406
But the motor's out.

1224
01:12:07,408 --> 01:12:08,941
What?

1225
01:12:08,943 --> 01:12:10,876
Yeah, the motor's out and
its' been out for a week.

1226
01:12:10,878 --> 01:12:13,312
And it's gonna be another week
until I get the parts.

1227
01:12:13,314 --> 01:12:15,548
Well, that doesn't fit my schedule.

1228
01:12:16,016 --> 01:12:17,750
Uh...

1229
01:12:17,752 --> 01:12:19,251
I'm just...

1230
01:12:19,253 --> 01:12:21,053
How much more do you need?

1231
01:12:22,055 --> 01:12:23,689
Do something, Mom!

1232
01:12:23,691 --> 01:12:25,391
You know what's happening.

1233
01:12:25,393 --> 01:12:28,294
He's sleeping with her.
Do something about it!

1234
01:12:31,832 --> 01:12:33,699
Duncan.

1235
01:12:33,701 --> 01:12:35,534
Yeah, that's it!
Walk away!

1236
01:12:35,536 --> 01:12:37,036
It's easier!

1237
01:12:37,038 --> 01:12:38,804
It's right in front
of your face, Mom!

1238
01:12:38,806 --> 01:12:40,374
Let go of me!
I'm not talking to you.

1239
01:12:40,376 --> 01:12:41,742
Well, I'm talking to you.

1240
01:12:41,744 --> 01:12:44,144
Just go screw her, asshole!
You already have!

1241
01:12:44,146 --> 01:12:46,613
She's certainly not going to do anything
about it. Are you, Mom?

1242
01:12:46,615 --> 01:12:48,448
You don't know what
you're talking about.

1243
01:12:48,450 --> 01:12:51,051
Everybody knows
what I'm talking about!

1244
01:12:51,053 --> 01:12:52,719
Really?

1245
01:12:52,721 --> 01:12:54,988
Both of you!
Stop it! Duncan!

1246
01:12:54,990 --> 01:12:56,723
Fine!

1247
01:12:56,725 --> 01:12:59,359
You don't want to do anything about it?
It's your life.

1248
01:12:59,361 --> 01:13:01,495
It's not mine.

1249
01:13:01,497 --> 01:13:03,296
I want to be with Dad!

1250
01:13:05,633 --> 01:13:06,900
Duncan.

1251
01:13:06,902 --> 01:13:09,369
Your father?
Good luck with that.

1252
01:13:09,371 --> 01:13:11,238
Hey, Trent, don't.

1253
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:13,040
He doesn't want you, kid.

1254
01:13:18,479 --> 01:13:19,880
Is that true?

1255
01:13:21,182 --> 01:13:22,616
Duncan...

1256
01:13:58,854 --> 01:14:00,955
I told you it sucks here.

1257
01:14:08,063 --> 01:14:11,132
I talked to my dad today.

1258
01:14:11,134 --> 01:14:14,135
I told him that we had
chased ghost crabs.

1259
01:14:14,137 --> 01:14:16,537
It made him very happy.

1260
01:14:16,539 --> 01:14:18,306
I felt like he was here.

1261
01:14:21,076 --> 01:14:22,777
"Did you tell him about the eyes,
Susanna?

1262
01:14:22,779 --> 01:14:25,346
"You've got to tell him
about their eyes!"

1263
01:14:26,248 --> 01:14:28,015
He gets so excited.

1264
01:14:32,554 --> 01:14:35,757
See, their eyes can
rotate 360 degrees.

1265
01:14:36,792 --> 01:14:38,559
They can see everything
that's around them.

1266
01:14:38,561 --> 01:14:40,561
But they can't
look straight up.

1267
01:14:40,563 --> 01:14:43,131
Which makes it easy
for birds to attack them.

1268
01:14:43,133 --> 01:14:46,300
So they have to gather their
food at night for safety.

1269
01:14:50,172 --> 01:14:53,441
I don't know.
My dad finds it cool.

1270
01:14:53,443 --> 01:14:54,742
He's a dork.

1271
01:15:03,752 --> 01:15:04,919
Wait.

1272
01:15:06,421 --> 01:15:07,488
Duncan.

1273
01:15:09,458 --> 01:15:10,992
I'm sorry.

1274
01:15:21,304 --> 01:15:24,106
Hey, it didn't mean anything.

1275
01:15:24,108 --> 01:15:28,177
It was just a mistake.
A stupid mistake.

1276
01:15:30,513 --> 01:15:32,681
God! I'm such an asshole!

1277
01:15:35,151 --> 01:15:37,085
Pam. Listen.

1278
01:15:39,022 --> 01:15:41,590
You deserve better.
I know that.

1279
01:15:42,692 --> 01:15:44,526
I have to be better.

1280
01:15:45,628 --> 01:15:47,429
I have to be better.

1281
01:15:48,364 --> 01:15:50,265
I'm gonna be better for you.

1282
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,401
And for Duncan.

1283
01:15:53,970 --> 01:15:55,237
Hey, what's up?
Where are you going?

1284
01:15:55,239 --> 01:15:56,305
Shut up, Peter.

1285
01:15:56,307 --> 01:15:58,407
Duncan?

1286
01:15:58,409 --> 01:15:59,508
Take me with you.

1287
01:15:59,510 --> 01:16:00,676
No.

1288
01:16:00,678 --> 01:16:02,110
- Please!
- No.

1289
01:16:03,213 --> 01:16:04,379
Duncan.

1290
01:16:04,381 --> 01:16:06,114
I'll scream.

1291
01:16:28,238 --> 01:16:29,338
I got it.

1292
01:16:30,707 --> 01:16:32,775
Or, you could just use the gate.

1293
01:16:43,187 --> 01:16:45,154
All right, everybody, be cool.

1294
01:16:45,156 --> 01:16:47,757
Our boss is here
with his pirate friend.

1295
01:16:59,403 --> 01:17:01,504
Hell, yeah.
I could use a cleansing ale.

1296
01:17:01,506 --> 01:17:04,340
Or check them out from afar.

1297
01:17:04,342 --> 01:17:05,508
I've had a beer before.

1298
01:17:05,510 --> 01:17:06,643
And I've spent
a night in jail before.

1299
01:17:06,645 --> 01:17:07,810
But there's a limit to everything.

1300
01:17:07,812 --> 01:17:08,878
Who's your friend?

1301
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:10,013
Peter.

1302
01:17:11,181 --> 01:17:12,382
Nice eye patch.

1303
01:17:12,384 --> 01:17:13,449
Thanks.

1304
01:17:13,451 --> 01:17:15,385
You don't sound
too cool with it.

1305
01:17:15,387 --> 01:17:18,221
My mom makes me wear it.
She says my eye confuses people.

1306
01:17:18,223 --> 01:17:20,056
Well now you gotta show me.

1307
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:24,594
Ha, ha!

1308
01:17:24,596 --> 01:17:27,297
Look at that thing!
She wants you to hide that?

1309
01:17:27,299 --> 01:17:28,398
Is she insane?

1310
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,533
I'd kill to have that eye.

1311
01:17:30,535 --> 01:17:32,035
You're full of shit.

1312
01:17:32,037 --> 01:17:33,436
Seriously. You know how many bits
I could do with that?

1313
01:17:33,438 --> 01:17:36,172
Daring people to look me
straight in the eye?

1314
01:17:38,142 --> 01:17:39,876
That thing is awesome.

1315
01:17:40,711 --> 01:17:43,279
You mind if I mingle?

1316
01:17:43,281 --> 01:17:45,048
Sure. But keep your
hands in your pockets.

1317
01:17:45,050 --> 01:17:46,749
You look a little shady to me.

1318
01:17:46,751 --> 01:17:48,518
I'll circle back.

1319
01:17:49,653 --> 01:17:50,988
Got a lot of confidence.

1320
01:17:50,990 --> 01:17:52,957
Hey, man. What's up?

1321
01:17:52,959 --> 01:17:54,091
So you're having a party?

1322
01:17:54,093 --> 01:17:57,661
Yeah, we're having
a farewell for Lewis.

1323
01:17:57,663 --> 01:18:00,497
I think he's serious this time.

1324
01:18:00,499 --> 01:18:02,433
Did you want to talk to me?

1325
01:18:03,268 --> 01:18:05,269
No, I just wanted to hang out.

1326
01:18:07,505 --> 01:18:08,839
All right.

1327
01:18:10,875 --> 01:18:14,078
How about we say you hang out
for a little bit? Okay?

1328
01:18:15,947 --> 01:18:17,915
I'm sure you'll
be wanted at home

1329
01:18:17,917 --> 01:18:19,817
at some point.
You're a popular guy.

1330
01:18:37,736 --> 01:18:40,571
Owen, you shouldn't have.

1331
01:18:40,573 --> 01:18:42,239
I went to three different places

1332
01:18:42,241 --> 01:18:43,874
in the water park to find that.

1333
01:18:43,876 --> 01:18:46,243
You can use it to
catch thunderclouds.

1334
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:50,314
Turn the music down.

1335
01:18:50,316 --> 01:18:54,251
We need to hear a few parting words
from our guest of honor.

1336
01:18:54,253 --> 01:18:55,319
Oh, no.

1337
01:18:55,321 --> 01:18:56,487
- Yes.
- No, thank you.

1338
01:18:56,489 --> 01:18:58,722
I don't want to open
myself up to some bit.

1339
01:18:58,724 --> 01:19:00,391
You want to be
part of a tradition?

1340
01:19:00,393 --> 01:19:03,060
There's no bit here.
We're going to miss you.

1341
01:19:03,828 --> 01:19:05,262
Plain and simple.

1342
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:09,667
I'm gonna have to sit for this.

1343
01:19:11,003 --> 01:19:13,438
No. You don't know
where this has been.

1344
01:19:14,673 --> 01:19:15,907
Um...

1345
01:19:17,309 --> 01:19:22,080
Well, won't say that I won't miss
some aspects of this place.

1346
01:19:22,082 --> 01:19:24,849
It wasn't completely
void of decent times.

1347
01:19:24,851 --> 01:19:28,686
I remember a couple of days
that were almost memorable.

1348
01:19:33,259 --> 01:19:36,528
I guess if there's one thing
I will miss dearly, it's...

1349
01:19:37,830 --> 01:19:40,031
Oh, my God!

1350
01:19:40,666 --> 01:19:41,800
What the hell, man?

1351
01:19:41,802 --> 01:19:42,867
It's part of our tradition.

1352
01:19:42,869 --> 01:19:45,270
What kind of warped
tradition is that?

1353
01:19:45,272 --> 01:19:47,105
Lewis was pouring
his heart out!

1354
01:19:47,107 --> 01:19:50,208
I was going to say people.
I'll miss the people.

1355
01:19:50,210 --> 01:19:52,310
Oh, my God!
Not you, Roddy!

1356
01:19:52,312 --> 01:19:56,081
Seriously! My doctor said
not to get water on my face!

1357
01:19:58,384 --> 01:19:59,784
Oh, my God!

1358
01:19:59,786 --> 01:20:01,953
The only thing that
could make this worse

1359
01:20:01,955 --> 01:20:04,489
is if there were more squirt guns.

1360
01:20:04,491 --> 01:20:06,057
And there are!

1361
01:20:12,131 --> 01:20:14,599
<i># I remember sitting in class</i>

1362
01:20:14,601 --> 01:20:16,768

1376
01:21:25,272 --> 01:21:27,072
You jerk.

1377
01:21:27,074 --> 01:21:28,741
That better be water.

1378
01:21:28,743 --> 01:21:30,543
It's a fun night.

1379
01:21:30,545 --> 01:21:32,044
Yeah.

1380
01:21:32,046 --> 01:21:36,282
I'm sorry. I'm developmentally
challenged. Like bad.

1381
01:21:36,284 --> 01:21:39,318
Nightmarey, special
episode bad. I'm sorry.

1382
01:21:39,986 --> 01:21:42,254
It's all right. I was...

1383
01:21:42,256 --> 01:21:44,391
I was a little frustrated.

1384
01:21:47,161 --> 01:21:52,899
I just planned on being here one summer,
and now it's three years.

1385
01:21:54,402 --> 01:21:56,303
It had a lot to do with you.

1386
01:21:59,106 --> 01:22:01,107
I just don't want to
look back and regret

1387
01:22:01,109 --> 01:22:03,710
that it should have
only been one summer.

1388
01:22:04,445 --> 01:22:05,579
You won't.

1389
01:22:36,510 --> 01:22:38,311
You were right.

1390
01:22:38,313 --> 01:22:40,513
We do sell coffee.

1391
01:22:44,453 --> 01:22:46,620
I said you could hang
out for a little bit

1392
01:22:46,622 --> 01:22:49,556
but sunrise of the next day is
where I have to draw the line.

1393
01:22:49,558 --> 01:22:51,024
You gotta go home.

1394
01:22:52,059 --> 01:22:54,961
I wish I could stay here forever.

1395
01:22:54,963 --> 01:22:57,497
You're going to love the winters.
They're pretty spectacular.

1396
01:22:57,499 --> 01:22:59,633
Painting houses until
it gets too cold,

1397
01:22:59,635 --> 01:23:02,770
bar backing at some dive,
talking to inanimate objects.

1398
01:23:02,772 --> 01:23:04,105
I'm serious.

1399
01:23:05,374 --> 01:23:07,174
Yeah. So am I.

1400
01:23:08,944 --> 01:23:12,346
There's a whole world
out there for you, Duncan.

1401
01:23:12,348 --> 01:23:14,048
Don't settle.

1402
01:23:14,050 --> 01:23:15,549
Not yet.

1403
01:23:15,551 --> 01:23:17,718
I don't have anywhere else to go.

1404
01:23:18,287 --> 01:23:19,754
Yeah?

1405
01:23:19,756 --> 01:23:21,622
I bet that's not true.

1406
01:23:23,292 --> 01:23:26,594
This is the only place I'm happy.

1407
01:23:29,631 --> 01:23:31,699
What's going on?

1408
01:23:34,002 --> 01:23:35,503
I hate him.

1409
01:23:35,505 --> 01:23:37,104
Who?

1410
01:23:37,106 --> 01:23:38,939
Trent.
My mom's boyfriend.

1411
01:23:40,409 --> 01:23:42,843
He said I was a three.

1412
01:23:42,845 --> 01:23:47,114
He asked me what I thought I was
on a scale from one to ten.

1413
01:23:48,050 --> 01:23:49,917
He called me a three.

1414
01:23:50,719 --> 01:23:53,120
Who says that to somebody?

1415
01:23:53,122 --> 01:23:55,356
Somebody who doesn't know you.

1416
01:23:55,358 --> 01:23:59,427
I didn't want to have to answer!
I shouldn't have to answer!

1417
01:23:59,429 --> 01:24:03,030
Listen to me. That's about him, man.
That's all about him.

1418
01:24:03,032 --> 01:24:04,732
It's got nothing to do with you.

1419
01:24:04,734 --> 01:24:06,400
Yeah? How do you know?

1420
01:24:08,003 --> 01:24:11,405
'Cause I know. Okay?
Don't worry about how I know.

1421
01:24:13,642 --> 01:24:15,076
My dad was the same way.

1422
01:24:15,078 --> 01:24:17,979
That's why I don't
like patterns and rules.

1423
01:24:17,981 --> 01:24:20,515
And that's why you
can't buy into that shit.

1424
01:24:20,517 --> 01:24:22,384
You gotta go your own way.

1425
01:24:26,255 --> 01:24:29,091
And you, my friend,
are going your own way.

1426
01:24:46,843 --> 01:24:48,744
Mom, they're home!

1427
01:24:48,746 --> 01:24:49,978
See you.

1428
01:24:52,448 --> 01:24:54,950
Where the hell have you been all night,
young man!

1429
01:24:54,952 --> 01:24:56,351
Not now, woman.

1430
01:24:56,353 --> 01:24:57,719
What did you say to me?

1431
01:24:57,721 --> 01:24:59,855
We'll talk when I get up.
All right?

1432
01:24:59,857 --> 01:25:02,457
Who are you talking to, buddy?
Don't you walk away from me!

1433
01:25:04,827 --> 01:25:06,661
Pam, he's here.

1434
01:25:06,663 --> 01:25:07,763
Where's your eye patch?

1435
01:25:07,765 --> 01:25:08,897
Lost it!

1436
01:25:17,740 --> 01:25:19,908
We were worried
about you, buddy.

1437
01:25:21,711 --> 01:25:25,013
Listen. Let's just forget about last night.
All right?

1438
01:25:25,015 --> 01:25:27,149
Start over. A clean slate.

1439
01:25:27,151 --> 01:25:28,950
Sound good to you, buddy?

1440
01:25:31,754 --> 01:25:33,889
I hope you're happy now.

1441
01:25:38,996 --> 01:25:40,563
What's going on?

1442
01:25:40,565 --> 01:25:43,199
We're leaving.
I need you to get your stuff.

1443
01:25:43,801 --> 01:25:45,168
Mom, I'm sorry.

1444
01:25:48,605 --> 01:25:49,872
I know.

1445
01:25:50,874 --> 01:25:52,909
Me too.

1446
01:25:52,911 --> 01:25:56,712
But, why do you and I have to go?
The summer's not over.

1447
01:25:56,714 --> 01:25:57,980
Duncan.

1448
01:25:57,982 --> 01:25:59,582
We can stay somewhere else.
I don't understand.

1449
01:25:59,584 --> 01:26:02,585
We want to leave early,
so that's what we're doing!

1450
01:26:03,554 --> 01:26:05,354
So, we're going with them?

1451
01:26:09,126 --> 01:26:11,294
I don't expect you to understand.

1452
01:26:14,531 --> 01:26:15,998
You're 14.

1453
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,302
And, I know that means you think
you know everything, but...

1454
01:26:19,304 --> 01:26:20,603
We do things.

1455
01:26:22,773 --> 01:26:24,373
We do things to

1456
01:26:28,178 --> 01:26:30,913
protect ourselves.
Because we're...

1457
01:26:32,115 --> 01:26:33,983
We're scared.

1458
01:26:35,586 --> 01:26:37,353
We're leaving with them.

1459
01:26:47,932 --> 01:26:51,367
All right.
We are good to go.

1460
01:26:53,805 --> 01:26:55,038
Thank you.

1461
01:26:57,442 --> 01:27:00,210
I think you are great.

1462
01:27:01,479 --> 01:27:03,046
You are.

1463
01:27:05,383 --> 01:27:07,317
So, I guess.
We're leaving.

1464
01:27:07,319 --> 01:27:09,257
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1465
01:27:14,492 --> 01:27:16,793
You just surprised me, that's all.

1466
01:27:20,732 --> 01:27:22,799
What are you staring at, perv?

1467
01:27:22,801 --> 01:27:28,272

What?

1492
01:29:19,719 --> 01:29:21,786
I came to say goodbye.
Come on.

1493
01:29:36,403 --> 01:29:38,971
I'm doing it, Hot Rod.
I'm gonna pass him.

1494
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:41,640
What?

1495
01:29:42,642 --> 01:29:44,910
Duncan, what's going on?

1496
01:29:44,912 --> 01:29:46,712
Pop 'n Lock's going for it!

1497
01:29:46,714 --> 01:29:50,783
He's gonna try to
pass Owen on the slide!

01:29:58,893 --> 01:30:02,261
<i>Of course, at his own risk,
at no liability for us.</i>

01:30:02,263 --> 01:30:04,329

1503
01:30:10,937 --> 01:30:12,438
What are we doing?

1504
01:30:16,443 --> 01:30:17,576
Where are we going?

1505
01:30:17,578 --> 01:30:19,678
I don't know.

1506
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:21,447
<i>So, how are you
planning to do it?</i>

1507
01:30:21,449 --> 01:30:22,548
I don't know.

What makes you think you can?

1509
01:30:25,618 --> 01:30:27,419
Don't die wondering, man.

1510
01:30:29,622 --> 01:30:32,758
All right, you go first.
I'll follow right behind you.

1511

This is my good shirt.
Don't steal it.

Three...

01:30:44,538 --> 01:30:45,905
Go!

1516
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:41,161
How'd you do it?

1517
01:31:41,163 --> 01:31:43,363
Can't tell you.
That's a secret.

1518
01:31:43,365 --> 01:31:45,265
Ladies and gentlemen,
the first person

1519
01:31:45,267 --> 01:31:47,734
to ever pass someone
on the water slide!

1520
01:31:57,011 --> 01:31:58,978
Mom.

1521
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:01,347
This is Owen,
my friend who can drive.

1522
01:32:01,349 --> 01:32:02,715
Owen, this is my mom.

1523
01:32:02,717 --> 01:32:04,585
This is your mom?

1524
01:32:04,587 --> 01:32:06,353
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1525
01:32:06,355 --> 01:32:07,688
Yeah, you too.

1526
01:32:09,191 --> 01:32:11,725
You've got a hell of a kid here.

1527
01:32:11,727 --> 01:32:13,060
Hell of a kid.

1528
01:32:15,697 --> 01:32:17,398
Are we done?

1529
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:19,066
You must be Trent.

1530
01:32:19,068 --> 01:32:22,002
I'm Owen, a good friend of "the three. "

1531
01:32:23,205 --> 01:32:24,672
Come on. Let's go.

1532
01:32:28,310 --> 01:32:29,944
I'll be in the car.

1533
01:32:33,114 --> 01:32:35,583
Hey, Mom,
can you give us a minute?

1534
01:32:37,853 --> 01:32:39,520
Mom?

1535
01:32:39,522 --> 01:32:40,621
Oh, yeah.

1536
01:32:41,489 --> 01:32:42,690
Of course.

1537
01:32:47,863 --> 01:32:49,296
Bye, Roddy.

1538
01:32:49,298 --> 01:32:50,531

Yes, I'm still here. Bye.
