1
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:51,618
In 926, the capital of Balhae
fell to Georan.

2
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:53,916
On the territory Georan founded

3
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:56,656
a new country called Dongranguk,
which means 'Georan of East'.

4
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:58,749
The survivals of Balhae,

5
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:01,487
however, kept struggling fiercely
to restore their country.

6
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:06,096
In 927, Autumn

7
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,830
A raid by the Killer-Blade
Army of Dongranguk!

8
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:18,863
Form a defense line!

9
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,303
Don't give an inch, just fight back!

10
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:47,588
Gunhwapyeong!

11
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,770
I'm honored.

12
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,113
The commander of the Killer-Blade Army
has come to pay a personal visit.

13
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:19,282
I came all the way to ask you something.

14
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,993
Wouldn't you rather cooperate
with Dongranguk?

15
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,995
I'm a human being.

16
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,599
You want me to be a dog
for Georan, like you?

17
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,619
Any last words?

18
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:36,231
I'm sad to announce

19
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:41,140
that even our future king, Prince Suhyeon,

20
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:45,008
has been assassinated by Gunhwapyeong.

21
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:46,377
Gunhwapyeong,

22
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:50,772
that traitor is killing off everyone
from the royal family, cutting off the lineage.

23
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:52,411
Son of a Bitch!

24
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:55,086
I heard the news has spread all over,

25
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,188
hurting the morale of the people.

26
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:58,553
It's a big problem.

27
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,523
We need a king at a time like this.

28
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:05,188
With Prince Suhyeon dead,
who can become our king?

29
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,923
Who else is left?

30
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:12,203
I've found a prince
whose whereabouts were unknown.

31
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:13,669
Oh, is there a prince?
Who is he?

32
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:17,001
Do you remember Prince Jeonghyeon?

33
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:30,521
What happened?

34
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,818
As you ordered, I sent
Maeyoungok and Mabul to Jungwon.

35
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:37,518
Youngok...

36
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:42,590
She always works hard.

37
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,903
According to a secret agent,

38
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,673
Balhae has also dispatched
an excellent fighter...

39
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,409
Who's that?

40
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,409
We don't know yet.

41
00:06:57,116 --> 00:07:02,520
Does anybody have any idea
who it could be?

42
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:08,324
This time you have to go far.

43
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,991
He's the son of LADY OH.

44
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:19,095
He was involved in some political strife
14 years ago,

45
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:21,234
and sent to Jungwon.

46
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,106
He was exiled.

47
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,701
The Killer-Blade Army will be coming.

48
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:32,541
We must find him before the they do.

49
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:55,864
We must have a king to unite our people.

50
00:07:56,776 --> 00:08:01,406
If we can unite our people and soldiers,
instead of fighting all over the place,

51
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,877
we can never lose...

52
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,425
Don't forget that.

53
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:19,921
Balhae's fate depends on him.

54
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:44,714
How was today?

55
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:47,653
What about the girl?

56
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:00,730
- Sosam?
- Yes.

57
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,000
What have you got?

58
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,506
What do you need to sell?

59
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:11,176
I'll meet the gentleman first
and tell him.

60
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,349
Gentleman?

61
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:20,087
Sit over there and wait.

62
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:44,480
There's no need to doubt.

63
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:48,245
Just tell me how much you can pay.

64
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,383
There are others who are doing
this kind of business.

65
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,083
Why did you come to me?

66
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,324
I heard there's no later trouble with you.

67
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:03,460
No trouble when dealing with Sosam.

68
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,172
That's right.

69
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:12,738
The important thing is whether there will be
trouble or not. The price is the next concern.

70
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:22,612
So, how much are you asking?

71
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,049
Fifty jeon...

72
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:27,522
You rat!
That's too cheap!

73
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:34,129
Is about right,
but I'll give you up to 80 jeon.

74
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:41,102
Fine.

75
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,491
Hey, Sosam, well...

76
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:31,215
I'm not sure where you heard of me
but you found the right person.

77
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:37,327
It's very important
who you deal with here.

78
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:41,725
You have to find a credible person...

79
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,802
I have a question to ask you.

80
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:48,562
What is your honorable name?

81
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:51,799
You were looking for Sosam.

82
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,674
I'm asking for your real name.

83
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,920
There are too many eyes here.
Follow me.

84
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:24,440
What you have,
only two of them were existed.

85
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:48,428
I thought I've been seeing strangers lately.

86
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:50,568
Your Highness,
there must be a misunderstanding.

87
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,997
I'd never misunderstand assassins.

88
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,677
Do me a favor.

89
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,049
Hey, Sosam.

90
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:11,250
That's no favor...
I thank you.

91
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,291
Don't worry and just go!

92
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:27,863
A misunderstanding?
Aren't you going to follow him?

93
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:31,167
I don't think anything
I say will matter right now.

94
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,937
Please, you guys need to help me.

95
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:40,348
Before that, you must help us first.

96
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:48,683
We're desperate.

97
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,925
I don't think so

98
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:56,631
All I have learned is how to kill.

99
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:01,902
No need to talk to you.

100
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:05,069
Kill her.

101
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,825
I said "I don't think so".

102
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,768
Okay, okay! Understood.

103
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,873
I would like to know something.

104
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:12,901
There is so called
"Rules" on the back street.

105
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:16,670
I know 10 ways to make you speak.

106
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:21,512
But, I'm not sure you can bear it.

107
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,988
Calm down.
I'm willing to give out everything.

108
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,031
Please sit down.

109
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:46,142
I'm Yeon Soha,
officer first class of Biseonwon.

110
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,275
Please forgive my discourtesy,
Your Highness.

111
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,850
Of course,
I have to forgive in this situation.

112
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:56,388
I don't know why you think so,
but I'm not an assassin.

113
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:59,450
Do you think I'm stupid?

114
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:03,055
They'll leave an exiled prince alive?

115
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:06,561
- What if other princes...
- All the other princes are...

116
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:09,962
are no more.

117
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:16,640
Your Highness!
You must become the king of Balhae.

118
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:19,574
I will be escorting you to Balhae.

119
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:32,484
I've lived in a place like this,
hiding from assassins for 14 years.

120
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:38,653
And now that painful time is all gone

121
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,427
and I am to be the king of Balhae, right?

122
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,539
Do you think I believe that?

123
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,342
OK.

124
00:16:56,315 --> 00:17:00,775
Let's say that's all true.
Do you think I'm crazy?

125
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,947
That's only a title. You're saying that
I should become the king

126
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:08,149
to be chased by Georan,
not knowing when I will be killed?

127
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:11,153
Do you know what I believe in?

128
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,265
"Survival, above all else."

129
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,635
That's all I'm interested in.

130
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:24,498
Your Highness!

131
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:19,927
My kids came back almost all crippled,
which means I lose face.

132
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,533
What are we supposed to do now, huh?

133
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:25,397
I didn't do it.

134
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:33,775
Did I say you did it, Prince?

135
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:47,284
You ain't from battle field, are you?

136
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:49,717
Tell me.

137
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,161
About what?

138
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:57,368
Tell me the details
so I can decide on the price.

139
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:00,471
How much money will you bring me
when I hand you over?

140
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:10,810
Always the same routine...
They need to be beaten to start speaking.

141
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,086
You... Stop!

142
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,430
She... She's the one!
She attacked us!

143
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:34,038
Welcome.

144
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:38,567
I've heard interesting stories
about your skills.

145
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:41,413
I'm the boss of...

146
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:44,382
I told you to take your hands off of him.

147
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:52,457
Not gonna work.
You should talk to me.

148
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:54,821
I'm the boss of...

149
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:02,423
Oh, Shit!

150
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:06,900
Your Highness, are you okay?

151
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,804
What's going on?
They're on the same team!

152
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:14,476
Please don't worry.

153
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:16,940
I will protect you.

154
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,314
Bo... Boss...

155
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:34,632
Yeon Soha... It's you.

156
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:37,699
You came here.

157
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:39,730
We've passed a couple of times,

158
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:42,137
but this is the first time
we've said hello.

159
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:44,571
What do we do?
There are more than two of them now.

160
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,441
Don't worry.

161
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:48,843
This is our region.
And we've got more people.

162
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,472
Who are they now?

163
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:52,612
They're Dongranguk's Killer-Blade army.

164
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:54,850
Officer Yeon,

165
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:59,524
wouldn't it be better if we avoided
any unnecessary killings?

166
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,126
Give us Prince Jeonghyeon

167
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:06,453
and we'll guarantee your life.

168
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:09,091
I can never allow you to take him.

169
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:15,933
It's not going to work by talking.

170
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:25,445
Everyone stop!

171
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:33,016
What?

172
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:38,862
Looking at the current situation,
I think you're the one we should join up with.

173
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:39,892
Get out!

174
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:45,597
Lt'll be better to talk.

175
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:48,205
I'm the boss of...

176
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:03,113
What are we doing?
Kill them!

177
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,462
Your Highness, please run!

178
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:18,230
What?

179
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:20,834
We have to run away.
Hurry!

180
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:31,104
What is the matter?

181
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:32,080
Your Highness!

182
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,686
They'll keep coming.
You have to keep away from them!

183
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,361
Follow me!

184
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:42,370
Tell me.

185
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:45,413
Who are you?

186
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:51,481
What do you have to do
with the Killer-Blade Army?

187
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:55,716
Most of them are traitors to Balhae.

188
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:58,925
In the past, I've seen them
in the military.

189
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:06,829
Is that why you introduced
yourself like that?

190
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,401
Is there something wrong with
how I introduced myself?

191
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:23,521
Then, how are you related to
my brother Suhyeon?

192
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:26,089
I've once guarded
the Crown Prince for a while.

193
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,860
We must go now.

194
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:35,730
Where to?
This is the safest place.

195
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:39,764
There is no safe place.

196
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:43,806
As long as we are here,
they'll eventually find you.

197
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:46,676
They will kill everyone on Wolnak street
if they need to...

198
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,704
That is the Killer-Blade army's way.

199
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,253
Didn't you say that surviving is
your only interest?

200
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:00,815
Then there's no other way.

201
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:09,590
Then follow me,
I know a shortcut out of here.

202
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:15,835
You want a drink?

203
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:23,105
Is this the fast way you've mentioned?

204
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,814
We must eat well to go fast.

205
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,176
How can we travel far without eating?

206
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:43,790
They are the Bidomun, a branch of
Heukdobang's gang. I recognize the symbol.

207
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:52,974
I heard they are out of their minds
because their boss was killed.

208
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:04,185
Let's go now.
We don't have much time.

209
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:08,087
I will decide whether to go or not.

210
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,152
If I don't like it, I won't go.

211
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,568
Who the hell are you?

212
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:24,739
My boss here told me

213
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,771
to ask you something!

214
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:31,109
What?
That girl?

215
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:33,976
What did she say?

216
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:42,450
She wonders if it's true
that your boss died

217
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:46,060
from overdoing it with women.

218
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:48,395
That bitch!

219
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,969
Please just ignore him and let it go.

220
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:02,536
Too late. We already heard him!

221
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:30,875
What are you doing?
We are still in mourning for my father.

222
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:34,843
That guy picked a fight with us.
We didn't have a choice.

223
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:39,916
I gave you an order to be cautious,
no matter what happened!

224
00:28:56,234 --> 00:29:00,432
Say again what you just said.

225
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:31,267
I found him! Here! Here!

226
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:46,982
It's very late.
Let's go now.

227
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:50,813
Uh... OK... Go quickly.

228
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:01,427
I appreciate your help very much.

229
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,728
Don't say that.
How can I just ignore this kind of thing?

230
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,660
I wish...

231
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:09,869
I wish I could cut him though

232
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,102
for your sake...

233
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:20,313
Everything will be okay, don't worry.

234
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:32,260
Let's go.

235
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:39,967
What happened?

236
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:44,899
After listening to our story,
she said she would help us.

237
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:46,407
Story?

238
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:49,236
You told her everything?

239
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:50,812
Are you out of your mind?

240
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:52,906
You have no idea how fast rumors
spread in this town.

241
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:57,210
I said that you abandoned your wife
and children to run away with a widow,

242
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:00,017
stealing your ill mother's money.

243
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:06,527
Hey! You're a warrior.
How can you lie to people like that?

244
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:11,228
Sword is not the only thing
you need in the battle field.

245
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:42,228
Put these on. It's going to be
a tough walk and quite cold from now on.

246
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:44,765
That's okay.

247
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:50,005
I'm not going to care
if you get cold later on.

248
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:55,836
Let's go.

249
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:05,380
How did you learn martial art?

250
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:10,288
I've only trained to use sword.

251
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:16,328
Where did you learn to use it?

252
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:20,067
I learned from a military camp.

253
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:25,968
I had learned from many soldiers
since I was little.

254
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,603
You had one rough life.

255
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:35,379
I would've give up.

256
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:51,564
What is going on?

257
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:57,835
I need to get horses.

258
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:04,040
I don't think it is possible.

259
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:06,484
It is not like stealing clothes.

260
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:07,951
It is way too difficult to steal them.

261
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,680
We have to wait till dawn, and...

262
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:15,282
Don't worry, I can pay.

263
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:25,266
Damn, it's hot!
It's killing me...

264
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:28,869
Wow, who's this! Brother Sosam!

265
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:32,807
- I brought you a customer.
- Customer?

266
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:49,852
Do you like any of them?

267
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:55,029
I want to buy the one on the far right
and the fourth one.

268
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:59,369
You know your horses.
But they are quite expensive...

269
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:04,475
Since you came with Brother Sosam,

270
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:06,670
I'll give you a good deal.

271
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:09,245
For the two, give me 300 jeon.

272
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:26,490
I live off of you, Brother.

273
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,793
But they're real good horses!

274
00:34:30,868 --> 00:34:34,031
- But they're stolen.
- Shhh! Come on...

275
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:39,971
She's fine. Who is she?

276
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,079
A devil from hell.
Come to take me to die.

277
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:49,752
What? Never understand a single word...

278
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:53,279
Anyway let me take a sword.
I'd better carry one

279
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:57,517
since someone's trying to kill me...
Let's see.

280
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:02,457
This one should be good.

281
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:05,494
Why did you choose that one?

282
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,970
Take a better one.
I'll pick one for you.

283
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:12,100
Doesn't matter.
I'll never use it anyhow.

284
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,336
You surprised me...

285
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:26,181
You're here again.

286
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:29,088
No word from the Deputy Commander yet?

287
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,255
Please don't worry...

288
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:35,530
Maeyoungok has never lost her quarry.

289
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:39,832
Wouldn't it depend on who the quarry is?

290
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:43,773
- Have you found out?
- Of course!

291
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:47,574
Do you know a female warrior
called Yeon Soha?

292
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,241
I'll go myself.

293
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:55,853
Are you going to kill the prince
again this time?

294
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:01,949
The royal court wants
Balhae's royal family to cooperate.

295
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:05,492
To help calm the conflicts and uprisings
all around the country.

296
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:10,391
But because you've been killing
every member of the royal family,

297
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:12,599
the court can't trust you.

298
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:17,240
If you want to gain something big,
you'd better control your vengeful spirit.

299
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,200
Understand?

300
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,466
Father!

301
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,281
Welcome!

302
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:59,249
How can I help you?

303
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:01,409
We don't need dinner.
Give us a place to stay.

304
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:02,383
Yes!

305
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:06,880
How many rooms...

306
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:12,092
Can't you see?
There are two people.

307
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,226
Then I'll prepare...

308
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,466
Give us one room.

309
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:19,692
One's enough.

310
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:47,394
Are you going to stay
like that all night?

311
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:51,160
This is the way Biseonwon warriors

312
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:53,328
guard the door of the king
until he falls asleep.

313
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,870
Please do not worry.

314
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:58,872
If you're going to be silly,
you'd better come in and be silly.

315
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,908
You're going to be the king.

316
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:04,743
There shouldn't be
any kind of scandalous rumors.

317
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:07,783
Are we in Balhae?
Who's going to see?

318
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:10,250
Whoever's watching or not
is not important.

319
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:14,790
Under the heavens,
The king should have nothing to hide.

320
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:18,089
You speak as if I'm going to be the king.

321
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:20,959
When did I say I would?
I'm not going to.

322
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:37,597
He said they went to Hadong.

323
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:44,512
The Chief Commander is coming.

324
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,423
Hey, Officer Yeon Soha!

325
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:58,724
You said you grew up in the military.

326
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:01,187
Was your father a soldier?

327
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:03,600
No, Sir.

328
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:05,626
Then, why?

329
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,302
I didn't have anywhere else to go.

330
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:15,636
Georan soldiers killed my father
when I was 9,

331
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:18,841
my mother when I was 10...

332
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:20,907
I didn't have any other relatives.

333
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:31,360
It'll be tough to get to Hadong today.

334
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:36,893
There's a place to stay near there.
A very cozy place.

335
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,374
What's that?

336
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,686
That incense...

337
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:05,088
It's my habit to comfort the dead.

338
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:11,968
Those who I used to know and the enemies
who have been killed by my sword.

339
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:15,161
You comfort even the souls
of your enemies?

340
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:20,309
With no hatred or resentment?

341
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:25,273
At least you won't be eaten
by an evil spirit.

342
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:27,514
Why?

343
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,552
I also learned how to use
the sword in Balhae.

344
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:33,287
I know the story

345
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:39,125
that evil spirits born from the resentment,
spite, and hatred,

346
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:41,194
that lives on in your sword.

347
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:51,231
Grown-ups used to scare me
with the story

348
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:56,902
that an evil spirit grows
by drinking blood

349
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:59,148
and finally makes the owner of
the sword evil as well.

350
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:02,279
I learned when I grew up

351
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:10,017
that the story meant one shouldn't
lose serenity because of hatred.

352
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:13,155
I believe evil spirits grow in the sword.

353
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,797
Do you still believe what you were told
when you were little?

354
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:28,473
That is why you treat it so carefully.

355
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:30,839
It protects you from evil spirits.

356
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:32,471
Yes.

357
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:37,888
I believe I have to use the sword

358
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,515
to protect my important things.

359
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:42,889
Hey...

360
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:47,387
What would people think
when they hold the sword?

361
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:53,295
Protecting? No way...

362
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:57,573
Killing comes the first.

363
00:42:58,042 --> 00:42:59,566
That is instinct.

364
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:10,149
I have tried to tell a couple of times,

365
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:13,982
don't give me that look.

366
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:17,352
Don't give me that pity look.

367
00:43:17,828 --> 00:43:22,891
I have had a fairly great life
until I met you.

368
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,102
I need to meet someone.
Wait here for a while.

369
00:44:06,176 --> 00:44:08,345
We don't have much time.
There's still a long way to go...

370
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:09,778
It's the owner of this shop.

371
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:12,345
Don't go anywhere, just wait here.

372
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:13,915
It'll only take me a moment.

373
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:27,322
Hey, who's this?

374
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:36,672
Here you go!

375
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:00,360
What are you doing here,
without telling us you were coming?

376
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:03,758
I'd like to get back my money
that you're keeping for me.

377
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:07,695
It looks like I'll have to go
in hiding for a while.

378
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:10,669
What have you done?

379
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:14,576
It's a long story. I'll tell you later.

380
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:51,514
So where are you going this time?

381
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:55,475
Well...
For now, quite far...

382
00:45:57,187 --> 00:46:04,116
Sosam, to be honest, some people
came by here yesterday.

383
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:05,225
Who?

384
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:12,932
They... Said they were
with the Killer-Blade Army.

385
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:21,641
And they're looking for you!

386
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:36,649
Let's talk.

387
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,314
Did you think you could
get away from me?

388
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:09,984
Let me ask you one thing.

389
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:14,096
Would you like to cooperate
with Dongranguk?

390
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:18,364
Negotiate?
I don't know what you mean by that...

391
00:56:04,728 --> 00:56:05,592
You...

392
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:09,664
Why are you trying so hard

393
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:12,628
to take me?

394
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:19,231
Because you're going to be
Balhae's king.

395
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:32,013
You've seen how I live.

396
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:35,618
Do you think the throne fits me?

397
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,861
You'll be an excellent king.

398
00:56:46,002 --> 00:56:51,030
Thank you for thinking highly of me,
but let me tell you one thing.

399
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:56,109
I was going to leave you here
and run away.

400
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:58,806
I failed because my friend betrayed me.

401
00:56:59,015 --> 00:57:03,111
If you were really going to do that,
there were a lot of chances.

402
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:08,714
Why do you think I'm telling you this?

403
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,992
I have no intention to go to Balhae.

404
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:14,425
If I hope to survive,
there are many other ways.

405
00:57:14,497 --> 00:57:16,658
You have to go no matter what.

406
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:22,830
Then tell me one good reason
why I must go to Balhae.

407
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,437
Why do I have to go there?

408
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:30,669
As far as I know, you weren't present
at your mother's deathbed.

409
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:36,784
We'll pass by Cheonaegok
on the way.

410
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:41,620
There is a graveyard.

411
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:54,300
Your Highness!

412
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:09,345
Long time no see.

413
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:42,242
I know only one thing.

414
00:58:42,485 --> 00:58:45,249
My father and family were dishonored

415
00:58:47,457 --> 00:58:50,126
and brutally killed by
the royal family of Balhae.

416
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:52,253
The charges against them
were not false.

417
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,493
I don't care who says what.

418
00:58:55,598 --> 00:59:01,298
I will kill whoever insulted
my father and family.

419
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:11,036
Your Highness, are you OK?

420
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:12,479
No, I'm not OK.

421
00:59:14,484 --> 00:59:19,683
Do you know how terrible
it is to be stabbed from behind?

422
00:59:52,021 --> 00:59:56,287
A message came from headquarters.
What would you like to do?

423
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:59,725
Say we haven't found them.

424
01:00:05,635 --> 01:00:08,570
I'm not going back
before I kill Yeon Soha.

425
01:00:11,641 --> 01:00:13,404
Kill Yeon Soha?

426
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:18,877
As long as I'm under orders,
I want to take care of it on my own.

427
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:21,374
And...

428
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:28,416
I don't want to cause trouble to you,
most of all.

429
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:32,089
I will give you four days.

430
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:35,597
If I see Yeon Soha,

431
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,197
you'll have no more chances.

432
01:00:48,177 --> 01:00:49,872
It was quite close.

433
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:54,106
I guess it may not be that serious...

434
01:01:05,962 --> 01:01:07,554
It is from the street fight.

435
01:01:12,268 --> 01:01:14,395
It is from the battle field.

436
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:17,729
What made you think...

437
01:01:19,475 --> 01:01:21,909
I wouldn't even get close to it.

438
01:01:24,614 --> 01:01:28,607
I was told you joined the majesty,
your father,

439
01:01:28,751 --> 01:01:31,777
for the battle against Georan
when you were only fifteen.

440
01:01:42,432 --> 01:01:43,456
Georan soldiers!

441
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:46,001
They seem dropping
out of the headquarters.

442
01:01:46,235 --> 01:01:47,133
Your highness!

443
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:44,517
Look at this chaos.

444
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:50,490
They wouldn't have time to pack.

445
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,730
They wouldn't even dare to fight, but run.

446
01:02:55,404 --> 01:02:56,564
What is that for?

447
01:02:57,507 --> 01:03:01,136
It is for you since you are not well.

448
01:03:02,678 --> 01:03:04,145
It seems so convenience.

449
01:03:05,915 --> 01:03:07,075
Hand it over.

450
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:08,915
I will do, your highness.

451
01:03:22,732 --> 01:03:23,391
Why?

452
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:27,398
Have you ever done carpenter's work?

453
01:03:28,538 --> 01:03:30,699
I had to fix stuffs to sell.

454
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:35,441
Some dorks broke things
when they stole goods.

455
01:03:38,447 --> 01:03:42,110
What? This is what I have been doing.

456
01:03:43,352 --> 01:03:47,049
You see!
I'm not even close to be a King.

457
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,583
You made wrong decision.

458
01:03:55,097 --> 01:03:56,394
General KeumHwee.

459
01:03:57,967 --> 01:04:00,299
For the fifteen years old prince

460
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:06,570
who was brave and fought in the battle field,
every soldiers called you by that name.

461
01:04:07,877 --> 01:04:10,437
With glint helmet,

462
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:15,140
You were surely stand out in the battle field.

463
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:18,278
How well do you know about me?

464
01:04:18,421 --> 01:04:21,390
There were many princes
who fought in the field

465
01:04:21,724 --> 01:04:24,887
but no one could even get close to
what you had done.

466
01:04:26,429 --> 01:04:30,160
You are the one people rely on
in this harsh time.

467
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:31,761
I'm nobody.

468
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:36,061
All that is left is useless myself, Sosam.

469
01:04:36,505 --> 01:04:38,370
Your real nature wouldn't have changed.

470
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:39,965
That is wrong.

471
01:04:41,177 --> 01:04:43,111
I have confidence in you.

472
01:04:45,781 --> 01:04:49,717
Don't be silly.
What if you are wrong?

473
01:04:53,155 --> 01:04:54,884
I bet my life on that.

474
01:05:25,121 --> 01:05:26,611
Do we have to do that?
