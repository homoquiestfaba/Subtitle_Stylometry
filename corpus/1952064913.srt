1
00:00:15,752 --> 00:00:18,312
(ominous music playing)

2
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:45,240
Dad.

3
00:00:49,786 --> 00:00:51,447
Dad.

4
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:55,419
Dad!

5
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,426
Daddy!

6
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,985
Dad!

7
00:01:00,029 --> 00:01:03,021
(doors opening)

8
00:01:05,568 --> 00:01:08,059
(gasps)

9
00:01:08,104 --> 00:01:11,335
(screams)

10
00:01:11,374 --> 00:01:15,208
Dad! Dad!
Get me out of here.

11
00:01:15,244 --> 00:01:17,940
Dad!

12
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:21,245
Dad! Daddy!

13
00:01:21,284 --> 00:01:23,275
Dad, help!

14
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:25,007
Get me out
of here!

15
00:01:25,054 --> 00:01:27,079
(screaming)

16
00:01:27,123 --> 00:01:29,284
Dad! Daddy!

17
00:01:32,095 --> 00:01:35,895
Daddy! Daddy.

18
00:01:35,932 --> 00:01:38,958
Daddy!
(wails)

19
00:03:11,294 --> 00:03:14,161
Woman: The laid-off factory worker
and prime suspect

20
00:03:14,197 --> 00:03:17,963
in the Walled In Massacre,
Thomas Sullivan, remains at large.

21
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,900
Sullivan has shown
a violent history

22
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:22,007
including a prior
rape conviction.

23
00:03:22,138 --> 00:03:24,971
The building's architect
Joseph Malestrazza

24
00:03:25,007 --> 00:03:27,168
is included
among the victims.

25
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:38,312
Currently there are
no further leads

26
00:03:38,354 --> 00:03:40,914
in the case
of the Walled In Massacre.

27
00:03:55,638 --> 00:03:59,096
- (indistinct conversations)
- (laughing)

28
00:04:04,981 --> 00:04:07,882
(clamoring)

29
00:04:07,917 --> 00:04:10,545
- Woman: Happy birthday!
- Man: Happy birthday!

30
00:04:10,586 --> 00:04:14,283
Man: All right!

31
00:04:14,323 --> 00:04:16,518
I call corner piece!

32
00:04:21,931 --> 00:04:23,922
(blowing)

33
00:04:25,668 --> 00:04:28,262
(cheering)

34
00:04:30,506 --> 00:04:32,974
So, Professor, how effective
do you think your classes were?

35
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:35,307
Well, I thought
I taught Sam

36
00:04:35,344 --> 00:04:37,471
how to build things,

37
00:04:37,513 --> 00:04:39,606
but whatever
makes her happy.

38
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:40,809
Should have known
she's not an architect.

39
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,286
Sam's a Walczak
and we blow shit up.

40
00:04:48,424 --> 00:04:51,985
Sam, come here.

41
00:04:59,201 --> 00:05:00,896
Incredible...

42
00:05:00,937 --> 00:05:04,338
to be the first Walczak
to graduate from college.

43
00:05:09,445 --> 00:05:11,743
Think fast.

44
00:05:13,115 --> 00:05:15,140
There's a gift in both,
but you only get to choose one.

45
00:05:15,184 --> 00:05:16,913
Dad, come on.

46
00:05:16,953 --> 00:05:18,682
That's not fair.

47
00:05:18,721 --> 00:05:21,622
Nobody said life was fair.

48
00:05:25,394 --> 00:05:27,021
You're 25 now.

49
00:05:27,063 --> 00:05:29,156
I'm offering you a deal.

50
00:05:29,198 --> 00:05:32,031
Your first demolition project
on your own.

51
00:05:32,068 --> 00:05:34,332
And if you succeed,

52
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,861
you are longer
my employee.

53
00:05:36,906 --> 00:05:39,306
- You'll be my partner.
- (applause)

54
00:05:39,342 --> 00:05:42,778
Dad, this is really important
for me.

55
00:05:42,812 --> 00:05:46,646
Don't you wanna see
what's in the blue one?

56
00:05:49,285 --> 00:05:51,617
For those,

57
00:05:51,654 --> 00:05:54,020
well, I got a little help
from Peter.

58
00:05:54,056 --> 00:05:57,651
Three weeks touring
the architectural wonders of Europe.

59
00:05:57,693 --> 00:05:59,217
It's always been
your dream, right?

60
00:05:59,261 --> 00:06:02,697
And they're for two.

61
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:12,669
Sam:
I have a friend who hunts.

62
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,767
He'll track a deer for miles,

63
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,337
totally quiet,
waiting for the right shot.

64
00:06:18,381 --> 00:06:21,817
And if his aim is dead on
and the deer goes down,

65
00:06:21,851 --> 00:06:25,810
he says he gets the biggest rush
of his life.

66
00:06:25,855 --> 00:06:28,790
That's how I feel
when taking down a building...

67
00:06:28,824 --> 00:06:31,588
studying blueprints,
exploring structure,

68
00:06:31,627 --> 00:06:34,824
drawing up demo plans,
placing the ammunition.

69
00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:38,828
That's all foreplay to me.

70
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,208
Pete, are you jealous?

71
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,775
Pete: Well, lucky for me,
Malestrazza's not alive

72
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:58,650
or I would be jealous.

73
00:06:58,688 --> 00:07:00,588
Sam:
Okay, I've passed the sign.

74
00:07:00,623 --> 00:07:03,683
- Pete: It should be right there.
- No, I don't see it yet.

75
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:07,689
People still live there,
huh?

76
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,756
Yeah, according to your father.

77
00:07:11,834 --> 00:07:14,394
Here it is.

78
00:07:14,437 --> 00:07:16,928
- Hello.
- Sam, I can't hear you.

79
00:07:16,972 --> 00:07:18,963
- Hello.
- Hello.

80
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:25,503
Can I help you?

81
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:29,272
Hi, I'm from Walczak,
the demolition company.

82
00:08:29,311 --> 00:08:32,678
I wasn't expecting you
so soon.

83
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:36,347
Are you alone?

84
00:08:36,385 --> 00:08:39,183
Yeah, for now.

85
00:08:42,258 --> 00:08:43,384
Jimmy!

86
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:51,026
I'm Mary Sutter.
I take care of the building.

87
00:08:51,066 --> 00:08:52,624
Did Mr. Collins tell you

88
00:08:52,668 --> 00:08:55,694
the nearest hotel
is 50 miles away?

89
00:08:55,738 --> 00:08:57,729
Yeah, but it might be easier
if I just stay here.

90
00:08:57,773 --> 00:09:00,742
Oh, good.

91
00:09:18,861 --> 00:09:20,385
Where were you?

92
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:22,897
Just playing
with the dog, Mom.

93
00:09:22,932 --> 00:09:24,490
Don't worry.

94
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:27,730
This is the lady
we were expecting.

95
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,829
Already?

96
00:09:29,872 --> 00:09:32,238
So why don't you show her around,
explain the rules

97
00:09:32,274 --> 00:09:35,471
and set her up
in room 208?

98
00:09:39,782 --> 00:09:41,875
And be polite.

99
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:51,688
Do you smoke?

100
00:09:51,727 --> 00:09:53,854
- Well, sometimes.
- No smoking in the building.

101
00:09:53,896 --> 00:09:57,423
Those are the rules.

102
00:09:59,435 --> 00:10:02,962
So this place is
in pretty good shape, considering.

103
00:10:03,005 --> 00:10:06,031
Yeah, Mom likes
to keep everything spotless.

104
00:10:06,075 --> 00:10:08,168
She's kind of crazy.

105
00:10:14,016 --> 00:10:17,952
Can we...
can we get the lights back on?

106
00:10:23,792 --> 00:10:25,760
The lights go off
every six minutes,

107
00:10:25,794 --> 00:10:28,262
you know,
to save electricity and stuff.

108
00:10:28,297 --> 00:10:31,892
If you spend a day in the halls,
you have to hit the switch 240 times.

109
00:10:31,934 --> 00:10:35,199
Oh, and never go
on the eighth floor.

110
00:10:35,237 --> 00:10:38,172
- That's Malestrazza's floor.
- The architect lived here?

111
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:41,005
That's the only floor
Mom doesn't clean.

112
00:10:41,043 --> 00:10:43,136
It's in the rules.

113
00:10:45,915 --> 00:10:48,748
Oh, and another rule...
don't go on the roof.

114
00:10:48,784 --> 00:10:51,480
It's too dangerous.

115
00:10:54,256 --> 00:10:55,951
Here it is.

116
00:10:55,991 --> 00:10:58,357
Home sweet home.

117
00:11:08,871 --> 00:11:10,998
What do you think he'll say?

118
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,168
- Sorry.
- Malestrazza.

119
00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:16,973
When he finds out you've come
to blow up his building.

120
00:11:21,216 --> 00:11:25,209
Hello, Peter.
Yeah, it's insane.

121
00:11:25,254 --> 00:11:27,449
I mean, imagine something
from Gotham City

122
00:11:27,489 --> 00:11:30,151
in the middle
of a freakin' marshland.

123
00:11:30,192 --> 00:11:32,092
Malestrazza was
definitely a genius.

124
00:11:32,127 --> 00:11:34,561
This building's amazing.

125
00:11:34,596 --> 00:11:38,430
It's like the Bates Motel,
only bigger.

126
00:11:38,467 --> 00:11:40,230
You know,
the kid who still lives here,

127
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:43,568
he talks about Malestrazza
like he's still...

128
00:11:43,605 --> 00:11:46,870
hey, hello?

129
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:48,900
(beep)

130
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:09,096
(girl whispering)
Samantha!

131
00:12:10,866 --> 00:12:14,597
(gasps, coughs)

132
00:12:24,113 --> 00:12:26,104
(whirring)

133
00:12:33,822 --> 00:12:36,347
(indistinct voices)

134
00:12:57,346 --> 00:12:59,541
(tapping sound)

135
00:13:10,325 --> 00:13:12,259
(footsteps)

136
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:20,130
Hello?

137
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:22,933
- (gasps)
- Oh, I'm sorry.

138
00:13:22,971 --> 00:13:24,939
I didn't realize
you were here.

139
00:13:24,973 --> 00:13:27,840
Do you like red wine?

140
00:13:30,412 --> 00:13:32,141
I also brought some bread

141
00:13:32,181 --> 00:13:34,911
and some pasta, some tea.

142
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,975
It's not much,
but it should do for tonight.

143
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:38,350
Thanks, Miss Sutter.

144
00:13:38,387 --> 00:13:42,118
No, please, call me Mary.

145
00:13:42,157 --> 00:13:45,354
So how many people
still live here?

146
00:13:45,394 --> 00:13:48,727
Only four.

147
00:13:48,764 --> 00:13:50,527
And this apartment?

148
00:13:50,566 --> 00:13:53,467
I'd offer to move you to another,
but this is the only vacant one

149
00:13:53,502 --> 00:13:56,164
- that hasn't been emptied.
- No, it's okay.

150
00:13:56,205 --> 00:13:59,197
It's just the last tenants,
why did they leave all their stuff?

151
00:13:59,241 --> 00:14:03,041
Because no one
came to collect it.

152
00:14:07,216 --> 00:14:09,207
Do you know the history
of this building?

153
00:14:09,251 --> 00:14:11,151
No, why?

154
00:14:11,186 --> 00:14:14,883
Perhaps it's best
you just do your job then.

155
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:19,354
Good night.

156
00:14:22,598 --> 00:14:24,793
Sam:
November 12, 2008,

157
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,734
demolition report
number 2893.

158
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:31,364
Originally designed and constructed
by one Joseph Malestrazza,

159
00:14:31,406 --> 00:14:34,102
the building contains eight
individual levels

160
00:14:34,143 --> 00:14:37,874
housing 120 residential units.

161
00:14:57,866 --> 00:15:00,562
(Christmas music playing)

162
00:15:05,007 --> 00:15:08,909
# Silent night #

163
00:15:08,944 --> 00:15:12,675
# Holy night #

164
00:15:12,714 --> 00:15:16,081
# All is calm #

165
00:15:16,118 --> 00:15:19,815
# All is bright #

166
00:15:19,855 --> 00:15:23,689
# Round yon virgin #

167
00:15:23,725 --> 00:15:27,286
# Mother and child #

168
00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:30,560
# Holy infant #

169
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:34,330
# So tender and mild #

170
00:15:34,369 --> 00:15:36,633
# Sleep in #

171
00:15:36,672 --> 00:15:40,005
# Heavenly peace #

172
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:45,838
# Sleep in #

173
00:15:45,881 --> 00:15:49,442
# Heavenly peace #

174
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,628
- Morning.
- Morning.

175
00:16:00,662 --> 00:16:02,926
Sleep well?

176
00:16:02,965 --> 00:16:06,162
Yeah, it was very peaceful.

177
00:16:08,804 --> 00:16:11,568
You're a very pretty girl.

178
00:16:11,607 --> 00:16:12,801
Strange job you've chosen.

179
00:16:12,841 --> 00:16:15,901
So I hear constantly.

180
00:16:15,944 --> 00:16:18,105
And will you blow up
our building on your own?

181
00:16:18,146 --> 00:16:19,738
No, I'm an engineer.

182
00:16:19,781 --> 00:16:22,045
I analyze the structure,

183
00:16:22,084 --> 00:16:25,485
examine the blueprints,
determine the best rupture points,

184
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,454
type of explosives,

185
00:16:27,489 --> 00:16:30,322
then I pass on instructions
to the detonation team.

186
00:16:30,359 --> 00:16:32,827
Wow, that's quite a big job

187
00:16:32,861 --> 00:16:36,126
- for a young engineer.
- Family business.

188
00:16:36,164 --> 00:16:39,292
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear!

189
00:16:39,334 --> 00:16:42,633
Howard won't stop fighting
with his brother.

190
00:16:42,671 --> 00:16:45,003
Denise, I need to introduce you
to someone.

191
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,304
He's dead set
on eating earthworms.

192
00:16:47,342 --> 00:16:49,105
Imagine,
nothing but earthworms.

193
00:16:49,144 --> 00:16:51,203
Listen to me.
You remember the eviction notice?

194
00:16:51,246 --> 00:16:53,339
What eviction notice?

195
00:16:53,382 --> 00:16:56,044
We all have to leave.
They're gonna tear down the building.

196
00:16:56,084 --> 00:16:59,781
Oh, and who are you, miss?

197
00:16:59,821 --> 00:17:03,518
This is what I was trying to tell you.
She's in charge of the demolition.

198
00:17:03,558 --> 00:17:06,186
Not the most graceful girl,

199
00:17:06,228 --> 00:17:07,627
is she?

200
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:20,305
Sam: To bring down a building,
you weaken the structure,

201
00:17:20,342 --> 00:17:22,503
and gravity
will do the rest.

202
00:17:24,012 --> 00:17:27,311
People are shocked to learn
how little explosive is needed

203
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:29,510
if you understand the building.

204
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,711
Sometimes you'll get a structure
in perfect shape,

205
00:17:33,755 --> 00:17:36,087
beautifully designed,

206
00:17:36,124 --> 00:17:38,422
could last forever,

207
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,428
and you know when
you're destroying it

208
00:17:40,462 --> 00:17:42,555
that you're taking
along the memories

209
00:17:42,597 --> 00:17:45,498
of people who have
lived there.

210
00:17:45,534 --> 00:17:49,197
Well, buddy,
we got a problem here.

211
00:17:49,237 --> 00:17:51,933
The wall's 16 feet closer
than on the blueprints.

212
00:17:51,973 --> 00:17:54,100
- (whimpers)
- That's huge.

213
00:18:20,602 --> 00:18:23,002
(wind howling)

214
00:19:11,987 --> 00:19:14,547
- (cat yowls)
- Shit!

215
00:19:39,347 --> 00:19:42,145
Jimmy's voice:
"November 12th. Her name is Sam.

216
00:19:42,184 --> 00:19:45,153
She's finally here,
and she's so pretty.

217
00:19:45,187 --> 00:19:48,350
I watch her work,
and I wonder if she knows I'm there.

218
00:19:49,424 --> 00:19:51,858
Her job is to blow things up.

219
00:19:51,893 --> 00:19:55,226
I'd love for her to show me
how to take down a building.

220
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,823
And I could tell her the whole story
about this place.

221
00:19:57,866 --> 00:20:01,825
At least what I want her
to know.

222
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:04,270
She'd believe
whatever I said."

223
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:14,310
Sorry, no credit cards.
Machine's broken.

224
00:20:14,349 --> 00:20:17,546
Do you have internet?

225
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:24,217
Sam:
You gotta be kidding me.

226
00:20:32,467 --> 00:20:35,732
That little liar.

227
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:06,590
Jimmy:
Look who's here.

228
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,371
- Hey, what's up?
- I don't know. Just hanging out. Why?

229
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:17,071
Shouldn't you be in school?

230
00:21:17,112 --> 00:21:20,445
No, I do correspondence courses.
Mom says it's better that way.

231
00:21:20,482 --> 00:21:21,915
Don't you have any friends?

232
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:25,647
Yeah, I've got one
and the dog.

233
00:21:30,859 --> 00:21:33,123
There used to be a lot more
houses like this before,

234
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:35,322
but most of them
were torn down.

235
00:21:35,363 --> 00:21:38,230
When the factory closed,
everyone just took off.

236
00:21:38,266 --> 00:21:40,257
This is all that's left.

237
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,068
Well, you really know how
to impress a girl.

238
00:21:50,545 --> 00:21:53,070
You know, I know
about Malestrazza, Jimmy.

239
00:21:53,114 --> 00:21:55,309
You don't know anything.

240
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:58,410
I know Malestrazza was killed.

241
00:21:58,453 --> 00:22:00,421
And I know
about the other murders.

242
00:22:00,455 --> 00:22:03,356
And you told me he was living
on the eighth floor?

243
00:22:03,391 --> 00:22:05,154
Why did you lie to me?

244
00:22:05,193 --> 00:22:07,184
I tell stories.
I don't lie.

245
00:22:07,228 --> 00:22:09,788
You lied when you said it was
dangerous to go on the roof.

246
00:22:09,831 --> 00:22:13,028
Why? Did you go?

247
00:22:19,841 --> 00:22:23,368
Listen, tonight,
I'll take my mom's passkey.

248
00:22:23,411 --> 00:22:25,208
We can visit
the eighth floor.

249
00:22:25,246 --> 00:22:27,339
We'll see if I'm a liar or not.

250
00:22:30,218 --> 00:22:32,209
Okay, we'll see.

251
00:22:34,222 --> 00:22:37,521
- It's funny.
- What?

252
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:40,960
You dress like a guy
and do a job usually...

253
00:22:40,996 --> 00:22:43,021
Guys do?

254
00:22:43,064 --> 00:22:46,056
You're a dyke, aren't you?

255
00:22:46,101 --> 00:22:48,069
Well, you get straight
to the point.

256
00:22:48,103 --> 00:22:50,196
I'm just curious.

257
00:22:50,238 --> 00:22:52,297
Why are you in the closet?

258
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,739
Ashamed?

259
00:22:53,775 --> 00:22:57,404
No, and I'm not a dyke.

260
00:22:59,114 --> 00:23:01,082
Well, that's a relief.

261
00:23:06,855 --> 00:23:10,791
- What did you tell her?
- Nothing.

262
00:23:10,825 --> 00:23:13,191
I said,
what did you tell her?

263
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,915
Just don't go anywhere
near her, Jimmy, please.

264
00:23:40,822 --> 00:23:42,619
I love you, you know?

265
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,326
She can never take care
of you the way I do.

266
00:24:04,479 --> 00:24:06,709
(indie rock playing)

267
00:24:32,907 --> 00:24:35,467
- What's wrong? Y'all need any help?
- (screaming)

268
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:38,911
It'll go faster this way.

269
00:24:38,947 --> 00:24:41,006
For you it's a job.

270
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:43,142
For us it's our lives.
(panting)

271
00:24:46,287 --> 00:24:48,278
Never forget that.

272
00:24:59,834 --> 00:25:01,825
Did somebody knock?

273
00:25:03,705 --> 00:25:06,469
Howard Carter,
say hello to our guest.

274
00:25:06,508 --> 00:25:09,068
Sit, please.
I'll make some tea.

275
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:11,738
And make yourself at home.

276
00:25:16,184 --> 00:25:20,143
So how are you enjoying
your stay with us?

277
00:25:20,188 --> 00:25:22,315
It's lively.

278
00:25:26,594 --> 00:25:28,755
You must really love reading.

279
00:25:28,797 --> 00:25:31,891
There are exactly 2,301 books

280
00:25:31,933 --> 00:25:35,801
on those shelves.
They belong to Mr. Malestrazza.

281
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,478
(teapot whistling)

282
00:25:56,324 --> 00:25:58,315
Here we are.

283
00:26:01,629 --> 00:26:03,187
Sugar?

284
00:26:03,231 --> 00:26:05,199
One, please.

285
00:26:06,768 --> 00:26:08,429
Yes...

286
00:26:08,469 --> 00:26:11,438
he was a very
distinguished person.

287
00:26:11,472 --> 00:26:12,996
I've heard.

288
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:15,168
But the murders...

289
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:16,768
weren't you scared, too?

290
00:26:16,811 --> 00:26:20,713
Well, at the time
of the disappearances,

291
00:26:20,748 --> 00:26:24,206
I lived here alone
and nothing ever happened to me.

292
00:26:24,252 --> 00:26:26,243
Do you want to know why?

293
00:26:27,555 --> 00:26:30,752
Because I'm a good person.

294
00:26:33,328 --> 00:26:36,786
Are you a good person,
Miss Walczak?

295
00:27:01,189 --> 00:27:03,885
"It was believed
that human energy and emotions

296
00:27:03,925 --> 00:27:07,361
could be imprinted
in the foundations of a structure.

297
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,595
Fear and death were considered

298
00:27:10,632 --> 00:27:14,398
to be the most powerful elements
to increase a building's longevity.

299
00:27:14,435 --> 00:27:16,232
The Egyptians practiced this

300
00:27:16,271 --> 00:27:19,297
by immuring
sacrificial humans."

301
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:24,471
(knock on door)

302
00:27:27,181 --> 00:27:29,172
Ready for our little trip?

303
00:27:32,587 --> 00:27:35,784
Malestrazza was a sort of
crazy genius.

304
00:27:35,823 --> 00:27:38,223
He didn't work for money.
He worked out of passion.

305
00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:41,695
Really secretive too. Never let anyone
take his picture or anything.

306
00:27:41,729 --> 00:27:44,197
How do you know so much?

307
00:27:44,232 --> 00:27:46,894
- I was born here.
- Come on.

308
00:27:46,935 --> 00:27:48,903
I read things,

309
00:27:48,937 --> 00:27:51,838
and I stole some books
from Denise.

310
00:27:51,873 --> 00:27:53,773
Oh, yeah? Me too.

311
00:27:53,808 --> 00:27:55,241
Which ones?

312
00:27:55,276 --> 00:27:58,245
"Primitive Beliefs
in Architecture."

313
00:27:58,279 --> 00:27:59,678
Interesting.

314
00:27:59,714 --> 00:28:02,239
I know.
You know, genius or not,

315
00:28:02,283 --> 00:28:04,217
he could have built
a damn elevator.

316
00:28:04,252 --> 00:28:06,846
(chuckles)
Around the time of the murders,

317
00:28:06,888 --> 00:28:08,879
there used to be a tenant
named Tom Sullivan

318
00:28:08,923 --> 00:28:10,891
who worked at the factory.

319
00:28:10,925 --> 00:28:13,655
One day he got fired
because the bosses found out

320
00:28:13,695 --> 00:28:15,560
about a prior rape conviction.

321
00:28:15,596 --> 00:28:17,757
That was enough
to make him a suspect.

322
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:19,164
So the tenants
called the cops,

323
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,168
but when they came
to question him

324
00:28:21,202 --> 00:28:23,033
he was gone
and they found nothing.

325
00:28:23,071 --> 00:28:25,631
No blood,
no signs of struggle,

326
00:28:25,673 --> 00:28:28,005
nothing.

327
00:28:28,042 --> 00:28:30,169
Rumors were going around
that Sullivan

328
00:28:30,211 --> 00:28:32,406
was using secret passages,

329
00:28:32,447 --> 00:28:35,211
that the mirrors
in the apartments were double-sided.

330
00:28:35,249 --> 00:28:37,877
The tenants were terrified,

331
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,149
and the disappearances
continued.

332
00:28:40,188 --> 00:28:43,180
Always mysterious.

333
00:28:43,224 --> 00:28:45,317
This is it.

334
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,319
Malestrazza's... where they found
a few of the bodies, even his

335
00:28:49,364 --> 00:28:52,527
and maybe even where his ghost
still hides today.

336
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:55,502
No one could ever accuse you
of subtlety.

337
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:02,842
And they wouldn't have found anything
if Sullivan hadn't made his one mistake.

338
00:29:02,877 --> 00:29:04,708
Oh, yeah,
and what was that?

339
00:29:04,746 --> 00:29:07,214
He kidnapped
that little girl.

340
00:29:07,248 --> 00:29:09,648
Julie.

341
00:29:09,684 --> 00:29:12,676
Wait. Not the little girl
from my apartment.

342
00:29:13,721 --> 00:29:15,746
Jimmy: What he didn't know
is that Julie's father

343
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:17,985
just got her a puppy.

344
00:29:18,026 --> 00:29:20,859
Smart little dog.

345
00:29:20,895 --> 00:29:24,353
- (barking)
- Your dog?

346
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:27,664
Yep, and when the cops
entered Malestrazza's place...

347
00:29:29,137 --> 00:29:31,071
The dog ran in
ahead of them.

348
00:29:31,105 --> 00:29:34,233
And?

349
00:29:34,275 --> 00:29:36,505
And we follow the dog.

350
00:29:41,249 --> 00:29:43,615
(barking)

351
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:51,458
Stay close
if you don't wanna get lost.

352
00:29:51,492 --> 00:29:54,518
It's a real maze in here.

353
00:29:56,664 --> 00:30:00,566
Malestrazza didn't have
any furniture, only books.

354
00:30:00,601 --> 00:30:03,570
He lived like a monk.

355
00:30:10,711 --> 00:30:12,611
Watch your step.

356
00:30:15,149 --> 00:30:17,845
(barking)

357
00:30:21,255 --> 00:30:23,587
This is where they found Julie.

358
00:30:23,624 --> 00:30:25,023
Sam: My God.

359
00:30:26,461 --> 00:30:29,021
(dog growls)

360
00:30:32,366 --> 00:30:34,197
That's where they found
Malestrazza.

361
00:30:34,235 --> 00:30:36,703
His face was almost ripped off
because of the cement.

362
00:30:36,737 --> 00:30:38,705
My mom was the one
to identify him.

363
00:30:38,739 --> 00:30:42,300
Mary? Why?

364
00:30:42,343 --> 00:30:43,970
She knew him well,
I guess.

365
00:30:44,011 --> 00:30:47,174
The cops found 16 bodies
in the building,

366
00:30:47,215 --> 00:30:49,809
but I'm sure there was more.

367
00:30:49,851 --> 00:30:51,842
Has to be.

368
00:30:59,393 --> 00:31:01,384
That's where they found my dad.

369
00:31:07,702 --> 00:31:10,364
Mom was there
when they dug his body up.

370
00:31:10,404 --> 00:31:13,339
She was pregnant
with me at the time.

371
00:31:13,374 --> 00:31:15,842
They say she hasn't
been the same since.

372
00:31:15,877 --> 00:31:17,174
(barks)

373
00:31:17,211 --> 00:31:19,839
Shut up! Wait outside!

374
00:31:19,881 --> 00:31:21,348
Go!

375
00:31:24,952 --> 00:31:27,079
Jimmy, I'm sorry.

376
00:31:27,121 --> 00:31:29,180
Why?

377
00:31:29,223 --> 00:31:31,214
'Cause I lost my mom
when I was a baby.

378
00:31:31,259 --> 00:31:33,090
I know how it feels.

379
00:31:33,127 --> 00:31:35,391
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

380
00:31:37,265 --> 00:31:39,859
So what did Malestrazza
look like?

381
00:31:39,901 --> 00:31:42,927
- You'll see.
- Right.

382
00:31:50,545 --> 00:31:52,945
- Shit!
- What?

383
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,574
No, nothing.

384
00:31:55,616 --> 00:31:58,414
It's a drawing.

385
00:31:58,452 --> 00:32:00,545
Told you you'd meet him.

386
00:32:00,588 --> 00:32:02,681
It's Malestrazza.

387
00:32:02,723 --> 00:32:04,623
Maybe his spirit never left,

388
00:32:04,659 --> 00:32:06,786
and he's hiding
behind this wall.

389
00:32:06,827 --> 00:32:09,227
Very funny.

390
00:32:09,263 --> 00:32:11,231
Hey, come here!

391
00:32:11,265 --> 00:32:13,699
Jimmy! Cut it out.

392
00:32:15,136 --> 00:32:16,933
(screams)

393
00:32:16,971 --> 00:32:18,461
Who is it?

394
00:32:20,675 --> 00:32:21,699
Jimmy!

395
00:32:23,644 --> 00:32:26,044
Who are you?

396
00:32:45,132 --> 00:32:47,123
(distant screaming)

397
00:32:57,945 --> 00:33:01,813
No, no, come on.
Don't do this.

398
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:07,009
No, come on.

399
00:33:07,054 --> 00:33:10,649
Don't do this. Shit!

400
00:33:12,093 --> 00:33:14,323
Jimmy:
Sam, where are you?

401
00:33:14,362 --> 00:33:16,421
Jimmy!

402
00:33:17,465 --> 00:33:19,729
Where are you?

403
00:33:23,337 --> 00:33:25,999
Jimmy?

404
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,372
Jimmy!

405
00:33:28,409 --> 00:33:30,343
Jimmy!

406
00:33:30,378 --> 00:33:33,279
- Girl: Samantha!
- Who are you?

407
00:33:33,314 --> 00:33:35,282
Jimmy, where are you?

408
00:33:35,316 --> 00:33:37,181
Girl:
#One, two #

409
00:33:37,218 --> 00:33:40,016
# He's coming for you #

410
00:33:40,054 --> 00:33:43,455
# Three, four,
cement will pour... #

411
00:33:43,491 --> 00:33:46,983
- Jimmy!
- # Five, six, it fills up quick #

412
00:33:47,028 --> 00:33:49,519
# Seven, eight #

413
00:33:49,563 --> 00:33:51,360
# You're too late... #

414
00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:53,697
- What do you want?
- # Nine, ten #

415
00:33:53,734 --> 00:33:56,794
# He'll wall you in. #

416
00:33:59,707 --> 00:34:02,369
Sam, it's me.

417
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:05,379
Where were you?
Calm down.

418
00:34:05,413 --> 00:34:06,903
Follow me.

419
00:34:06,947 --> 00:34:10,906
Come on, hurry up.

420
00:34:10,951 --> 00:34:12,475
Come on.

421
00:34:14,955 --> 00:34:16,980
(crying)

422
00:34:27,068 --> 00:34:30,663
It's okay.
It's over now.

423
00:34:38,546 --> 00:34:41,709
I'm losing my mind,
Jimmy.

424
00:34:41,749 --> 00:34:43,808
I'm hearing voices.

425
00:34:52,893 --> 00:34:55,453
Show me your knee.

426
00:34:55,496 --> 00:34:58,624
I'm fine.

427
00:34:58,666 --> 00:35:00,463
Come on.

428
00:35:00,501 --> 00:35:02,093
It's my fault you fell.

429
00:35:16,617 --> 00:35:18,608
(winces)

430
00:35:27,094 --> 00:35:28,652
(winces)

431
00:35:31,132 --> 00:35:32,929
Is that better?

432
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:45,404
You look even prettier
that way.

433
00:35:45,446 --> 00:35:47,846
You should keep your hair down
more often.

434
00:36:17,478 --> 00:36:19,446
Jimmy.

435
00:36:21,649 --> 00:36:24,174
What are you doing?

436
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:50,541
What do you want from me?

437
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:56,143
Poor girl.

438
00:37:11,465 --> 00:37:13,524
(rattling)

439
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:58,971
(gasping)

440
00:38:00,347 --> 00:38:02,406
(screaming)

441
00:38:12,393 --> 00:38:14,418
Girl:
You're the one, Samantha.

442
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:17,658
You're our savior.

443
00:38:24,438 --> 00:38:27,464
Help! Help!

444
00:38:27,508 --> 00:38:29,567
Help!

445
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:31,441
Help me!

446
00:38:31,478 --> 00:38:34,845
Somebody, help!

447
00:38:34,882 --> 00:38:36,315
Help!

448
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:38,341
Let me out of here!

449
00:38:38,385 --> 00:38:40,250
(screaming)

450
00:38:45,292 --> 00:38:47,283
(panting)

451
00:39:04,945 --> 00:39:07,106
(banging sound)

452
00:39:59,133 --> 00:40:00,657
(screams)

453
00:40:00,701 --> 00:40:04,364
- Hey.
- (panting) Hey.

454
00:40:04,405 --> 00:40:06,532
You didn't think you could
get away that easily, did you?

455
00:40:06,573 --> 00:40:09,406
- Did you do that?
- What?

456
00:40:09,443 --> 00:40:11,104
That? No.

457
00:40:11,145 --> 00:40:13,170
Look, you shouldn't leave
your door unlocked.

458
00:40:14,615 --> 00:40:17,846
Mr. Burnett, open up.

459
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:22,088
Listen, there's no use
pretending you're not in there.

460
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,791
How can I help you?

461
00:40:27,828 --> 00:40:29,659
Did you have fun last night

462
00:40:29,697 --> 00:40:31,528
in Malestrazza's apartment?

463
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,525
(labored breathing)

464
00:40:37,738 --> 00:40:41,367
Trying to scare Jimmy and me
won't change anything.

465
00:40:41,408 --> 00:40:42,898
Burnett: Jimmy...

466
00:40:42,943 --> 00:40:45,810
interesting kid.

467
00:40:45,846 --> 00:40:48,542
You think I scare Jimmy?

468
00:40:48,582 --> 00:40:50,641
(coughs)

469
00:40:50,684 --> 00:40:53,175
The government ordered
this building to be destroyed.

470
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,881
There's nothing anyone
can do about it.

471
00:40:54,922 --> 00:40:56,787
There's no point
in harassing me.

472
00:41:00,427 --> 00:41:01,894
He gave that to you?

473
00:41:01,929 --> 00:41:03,726
Burnett: Little souvenir.

474
00:41:03,764 --> 00:41:06,699
He offered me
this apartment

475
00:41:06,734 --> 00:41:10,693
the day he learned

476
00:41:10,738 --> 00:41:14,265
how shitty my
disability pension was.

477
00:41:14,308 --> 00:41:17,744
So did you live here
when the murders happened?

478
00:41:17,778 --> 00:41:19,439
The cops thought
I was the killer.

479
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,812
I did two months' time

480
00:41:21,849 --> 00:41:23,612
because of my good looks.

481
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:26,244
I was the perfect suspect.

482
00:41:28,789 --> 00:41:31,314
Leave me alone.

483
00:41:36,997 --> 00:41:38,658
Why's he still here?

484
00:41:38,699 --> 00:41:41,031
Maybe he doesn't have
anywhere else to go.

485
00:41:41,068 --> 00:41:44,731
Huh. Well, let's go check out
Malestrazza's place.

486
00:41:44,772 --> 00:41:46,797
- You a fan of his?
- I don't know.

487
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,933
I haven't decided.

488
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,930
He's growing up so fast,

489
00:42:17,571 --> 00:42:20,472
reads everything
he gets his hands on.

490
00:42:20,507 --> 00:42:23,635
So full of stories.

491
00:42:23,677 --> 00:42:25,804
He gets his temper from me,

492
00:42:25,846 --> 00:42:28,371
but I understand.

493
00:42:28,415 --> 00:42:31,646
He's lonely.

494
00:42:31,685 --> 00:42:34,210
But soon he'll be free of this.

495
00:42:37,291 --> 00:42:39,657
We all will.

496
00:42:39,693 --> 00:42:42,355
Then you'll have peace...

497
00:42:44,898 --> 00:42:46,889
just like I promised.

498
00:43:13,994 --> 00:43:16,224
- That was close.
- Mm-hmm.

499
00:43:17,664 --> 00:43:20,861
- (metal clanking)
- Oh, shit!

500
00:43:20,901 --> 00:43:24,701
Mary!
Mary, can you hear me?

501
00:43:28,108 --> 00:43:30,906
(knock on door)

502
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,104
So you're the legend.

503
00:43:34,147 --> 00:43:36,479
Sam: Find anything?

504
00:43:36,516 --> 00:43:39,076
Like a secret passage?

505
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:58,934
You gotta be kidding me.

506
00:44:04,278 --> 00:44:07,076
Sam: Jesus, this was definitely not
in the blueprints.

507
00:44:07,114 --> 00:44:09,742
Pete: Should we climb down?

508
00:44:09,783 --> 00:44:12,513
Sam: Beats spending
the night up here.

509
00:44:18,191 --> 00:44:20,659
Be careful, Sam.

510
00:44:34,741 --> 00:44:36,766
Sam: I can't believe it.

511
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:39,176
The little shit.

512
00:44:39,212 --> 00:44:41,305
He's been watching me
in my bathroom.

513
00:44:43,216 --> 00:44:46,185
You all right?

514
00:45:07,574 --> 00:45:10,566
- Look.
- What is it?

515
00:45:30,697 --> 00:45:32,688
(gasps)

516
00:45:40,273 --> 00:45:42,673
Okay, let's get out of here.

517
00:45:43,944 --> 00:45:46,276
(screaming)

518
00:45:48,915 --> 00:45:50,940
Is going through
other people's garbage also part

519
00:45:50,984 --> 00:45:52,884
of your job description?

520
00:45:55,155 --> 00:45:56,383
It was the dog's fault.

521
00:45:56,423 --> 00:45:58,050
I threw him his ball
in the garbage room

522
00:45:58,091 --> 00:46:00,082
and he hit the switch
on the wall.

523
00:46:00,127 --> 00:46:02,960
That's how I found the passage.
I didn't do anything.

524
00:46:02,996 --> 00:46:06,955
You were watching me
from there, weren't you?

525
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,401
And you were in on it with Burnett
the other night to scare me.

526
00:46:14,241 --> 00:46:16,402
We'll deal with this later.
Go to your room.

527
00:46:33,527 --> 00:46:35,495
Sam:
This your husband?

528
00:46:35,529 --> 00:46:37,895
Yes.

529
00:46:37,931 --> 00:46:39,922
He was a writer.

530
00:46:39,966 --> 00:46:43,561
Malestrazza offered us this place
so he could finish his novel.

531
00:46:45,539 --> 00:46:48,064
He said there's nowhere
like it on earth.

532
00:46:49,476 --> 00:46:50,943
He was right.

533
00:46:50,977 --> 00:46:53,241
Sam: Forgive me for being
so direct,

534
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,077
but why did you stay?

535
00:46:55,115 --> 00:46:57,948
Most tenants left.

536
00:46:57,984 --> 00:47:00,612
A few stayed 'cause they had
nowhere else to go.

537
00:47:00,654 --> 00:47:03,179
It's better here for us.
We're close to him.

538
00:47:03,223 --> 00:47:05,316
Close to your husband?

539
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:08,555
But part of me
doesn't believe he's gone,

540
00:47:08,595 --> 00:47:10,256
and it's better for Jimmy.

541
00:47:10,297 --> 00:47:12,959
The spirit of his father
is helpful to him.

542
00:47:12,999 --> 00:47:15,467
I took the caretaker's job

543
00:47:15,502 --> 00:47:17,834
just to be around him.

544
00:47:17,871 --> 00:47:21,102
Malestrazza thought
it would last forever, this building.

545
00:47:22,209 --> 00:47:24,939
Probably would have.

546
00:47:26,046 --> 00:47:28,037
You're our savior, Sam.

547
00:47:30,984 --> 00:47:33,748
In a few days,
there will be nothing here but dirt.

548
00:47:35,722 --> 00:47:37,917
Not even a headstone.

549
00:48:06,486 --> 00:48:09,478
Pete: Look, I do know
that you're overwhelmed

550
00:48:09,523 --> 00:48:11,787
and things are really crazy,

551
00:48:11,825 --> 00:48:13,816
but there's one way
to make it better.

552
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,851
Let's take the trip.

553
00:48:15,896 --> 00:48:17,887
Now we could go tomorrow.

554
00:48:19,733 --> 00:48:21,928
You need to get out
of here, Sam.

555
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:29,170
(sighs)
We'll leave in the morning.

556
00:48:30,677 --> 00:48:33,510
Sweetheart.

557
00:48:33,547 --> 00:48:36,175
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

558
00:49:02,108 --> 00:49:04,736
(loud bang)

559
00:49:07,447 --> 00:49:09,540
(panting)

560
00:49:16,723 --> 00:49:19,055
(panting continues)

561
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:28,397
What?

562
00:49:28,435 --> 00:49:30,630
Nothing.

563
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:32,661
Shh.

564
00:50:07,574 --> 00:50:09,565
(gasps)

565
00:50:23,923 --> 00:50:25,914
(electricity crackling)

566
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:34,567
(screams)

567
00:50:41,341 --> 00:50:43,036
It's probably Jimmy.

568
00:50:44,944 --> 00:50:48,675
- Why would he do that?
- I don't know, but who else?

569
00:50:57,657 --> 00:51:01,149
Knew him my whole life.
He was the best friend I had.

570
00:51:01,194 --> 00:51:02,991
Jimmy, did you do this?

571
00:51:04,064 --> 00:51:06,726
- Do you really mean that?
- Well, who else did it?

572
00:51:06,766 --> 00:51:08,233
What difference
does it make now?

573
00:51:08,268 --> 00:51:10,998
My only friend is dead,
and my house is gonna be destroyed.

574
00:51:11,037 --> 00:51:14,006
You're just gonna leave
with that guy and forget all about us.

575
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:17,168
It's okay. We're used
to being forgotten here.

576
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:19,337
Listen, I'm not gonna forget
about you.

577
00:51:19,379 --> 00:51:22,940
You don't give a shit about me.
I'm just a crazy little boy.

578
00:51:22,982 --> 00:51:24,449
No, you're not.

579
00:51:24,484 --> 00:51:26,008
Prove it.

580
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:33,848
Sam: " The building is vulnerable
to precision implosion.

581
00:51:33,893 --> 00:51:35,827
Suggested volume
of detonation...

582
00:51:35,862 --> 00:51:38,456
600kg of TNT
spread equally

583
00:51:38,498 --> 00:51:40,295
at the preset rupture points.

584
00:51:40,333 --> 00:51:43,962
Your very truly,
Walczak & Sons.

585
00:51:52,112 --> 00:51:54,137
Finished?

586
00:51:59,352 --> 00:52:02,913
I don't know.
This place is still hiding something.

587
00:52:02,956 --> 00:52:04,321
The blueprints are wrong.

588
00:52:04,357 --> 00:52:06,757
I mean, nothing corresponds.

589
00:52:06,793 --> 00:52:08,260
Okay, look,

590
00:52:08,294 --> 00:52:11,661
I find this place as fascinating
as you do,

591
00:52:11,698 --> 00:52:14,496
but waking up with a dead dog
as a houseguest

592
00:52:14,534 --> 00:52:17,503
makes me think
perhaps it's time to go.

593
00:52:22,575 --> 00:52:24,702
(knock on door)

594
00:52:27,447 --> 00:52:30,314
- Hey.
- Hey.

595
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:33,581
I wanted to apologize
for before

596
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:37,420
and all the other stuff I did.

597
00:52:37,457 --> 00:52:40,051
Don't worry about it.

598
00:52:41,127 --> 00:52:43,493
Pete: Hi, Jimmy.

599
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:45,589
Sorry about your dog.

600
00:52:48,668 --> 00:52:50,659
For you.

601
00:52:52,005 --> 00:52:54,098
I stole it from Denise's place.

602
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:57,837
To tell you the truth,
I found the secret passage from this.

603
00:52:57,877 --> 00:53:01,540
Thought you'd might want it.

604
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:08,150
Is this what I think it is?

605
00:53:08,188 --> 00:53:09,382
Handwritten
by the man himself.

606
00:53:09,422 --> 00:53:11,390
There's everything
about the building...

607
00:53:11,424 --> 00:53:14,450
his theories,
philosophies also.

608
00:53:14,494 --> 00:53:16,724
Check out the drawings.

609
00:53:24,537 --> 00:53:27,165
No wonder the blueprints
were off.

610
00:53:27,207 --> 00:53:29,675
There's so much space
in the center of the building.

611
00:53:29,709 --> 00:53:31,142
Of course.

612
00:53:33,179 --> 00:53:35,306
Of course.

613
00:53:36,349 --> 00:53:39,648
Malestrazza was inspired
by the Egyptian pyramids.

614
00:53:39,686 --> 00:53:43,247
(panting) His apartment
on the eighth floor must be the summit,

615
00:53:44,257 --> 00:53:45,849
and the basement
the foundation.

616
00:53:45,892 --> 00:53:48,486
Do you think we'll find
any more bodies?

617
00:53:48,528 --> 00:53:50,519
'Cause if it's like the pyramids,

618
00:53:50,563 --> 00:53:52,588
then there has
to be a tomb somewhere.

619
00:53:52,632 --> 00:53:54,759
Which would make sense
if it's behind this wall.

620
00:53:54,801 --> 00:53:57,429
(grunts) The Egyptians
would always make sure

621
00:53:57,470 --> 00:54:00,871
that sunlight could
shine down into a pharaoh's tomb.

622
00:54:00,907 --> 00:54:04,308
So there's gotta be some sort
of access to it from the roof

623
00:54:04,344 --> 00:54:06,244
if it exists.

624
00:54:06,279 --> 00:54:08,270
I'll go look.

625
00:54:16,055 --> 00:54:18,285
Look, I don't trust that kid.

626
00:54:18,324 --> 00:54:21,782
Jimmy. Jimmy!

627
00:54:26,132 --> 00:54:28,123
Sure he came up here?

628
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:49,714
He knew about it all along.

629
00:54:49,756 --> 00:54:51,986
Okay, come on.
Let's get out of here, come on.

630
00:54:52,025 --> 00:54:54,084
Jimmy:
Help, I'm down here!

631
00:54:54,127 --> 00:54:56,561
Jimmy.

632
00:54:57,897 --> 00:55:00,024
- Jimmy!
- Sam, help!

633
00:55:00,066 --> 00:55:01,761
- Shit
- I fell down.

634
00:55:01,801 --> 00:55:04,167
I think I broke my leg.

635
00:55:04,203 --> 00:55:07,070
Hold on, we're coming.

636
00:55:07,106 --> 00:55:10,507
Okay, I'm gonna go down.
Grab the other end.

637
00:55:10,543 --> 00:55:13,706
- Okay.
- Jimmy: Sam, help!

638
00:55:13,746 --> 00:55:16,681
- I'm bleeding.
- We're coming!

639
00:55:16,716 --> 00:55:18,684
- Good?
- Yeah.

640
00:55:18,718 --> 00:55:22,017
No no, wait. I'm not gonna be able
to lift both of you back up.

641
00:55:22,055 --> 00:55:23,784
Shit.

642
00:55:23,823 --> 00:55:27,259
- I'll go down.
- No no.

643
00:55:27,293 --> 00:55:29,056
- Jimmy: Sam.
- We're coming!

644
00:55:29,095 --> 00:55:31,586
Come on, it's the only way.

645
00:55:33,833 --> 00:55:35,630
- Good?
- Yeah.

646
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:41,534
You okay?

647
00:56:22,181 --> 00:56:24,479
(scraping sound)

648
00:56:32,759 --> 00:56:35,091
(screams) No!

649
00:56:40,433 --> 00:56:43,425
No!

650
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:52,769
(screams) No!

651
00:56:57,784 --> 00:56:59,752
(Sam whimpers)

652
00:56:59,786 --> 00:57:02,619
(grunting)

653
00:57:02,655 --> 00:57:04,646
(panting)

654
00:57:22,709 --> 00:57:24,700
Peter?

655
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,747
Who are you?

656
00:57:38,124 --> 00:57:41,651
Man: I think you know
very well who I am.

657
00:57:41,694 --> 00:57:43,685
Sam: Malestrazza?

658
00:57:44,697 --> 00:57:47,495
But you're supposed
to be dead.

659
00:57:47,533 --> 00:57:50,229
Man:
Really? Then I guess hell

660
00:57:50,269 --> 00:57:53,033
just got a little bit nicer.

661
00:57:53,072 --> 00:57:55,438
Sam:
Where's Jimmy and Peter?

662
00:57:55,475 --> 00:57:57,466
Answer me!

663
00:57:58,711 --> 00:58:01,339
Jimmy:
Help, Sam, I'm hurt!

664
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:03,348
- (sound of tape rewinding)
- (click)

665
00:58:03,382 --> 00:58:06,579
Jimmy:
Help, Sam, I'm hurt!

666
00:58:55,735 --> 00:58:58,636
Sam: Where's Peter?

667
00:59:02,708 --> 00:59:04,699
Sam:
Don't come near me!

668
00:59:43,883 --> 00:59:46,784
Jimmy: " Dear Sam, I love you
and I can't let you leave me.

669
00:59:46,819 --> 00:59:49,185
You'll have to live
with your genius for a while,

670
00:59:49,222 --> 00:59:52,089
but don't worry,
I'm watching over you.

671
00:59:52,124 --> 00:59:54,615
He won't hurt you
as long as you obey me.

672
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:56,628
If not, I'll kill you,

673
00:59:56,662 --> 00:59:59,256
just like my best friend.

674
00:59:59,298 --> 01:00:02,529
I'll teach you how to love me.
I'll always love you."

675
01:00:05,338 --> 01:00:07,898
Jimmy!

676
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:09,965
No.
What are you doing?!

677
01:00:10,009 --> 01:00:13,308
Jimmy, come back!

678
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:16,844
Jimmy!

679
01:00:23,389 --> 01:00:25,823
Mary:
Happy anniversary, darling.

680
01:00:29,295 --> 01:00:31,889
He will suffer.

681
01:00:31,931 --> 01:00:33,922
I promise.

682
01:02:05,524 --> 01:02:07,515
Where's Peter?

683
01:02:08,627 --> 01:02:11,357
Please tell me
where Peter is.

684
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:31,040
One for every soul.

685
01:02:52,838 --> 01:02:56,569
Do you really think
a simple factory worker

686
01:02:56,609 --> 01:02:58,577
could have orchestrated

687
01:02:58,611 --> 01:03:00,772
those deaths?

688
01:03:10,689 --> 01:03:12,589
Jimmy!

689
01:03:12,625 --> 01:03:14,820
Jimmy,
get me out of here!

690
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:16,725
Now!

691
01:03:30,476 --> 01:03:32,444
(classical music playing)

692
01:03:35,881 --> 01:03:38,975
This can't be real.

693
01:03:40,352 --> 01:03:42,616
This can't be real.

694
01:03:42,655 --> 01:03:44,782
It's really quite simple.

695
01:03:44,824 --> 01:03:47,486
The boy gives us an order
and we obey him.

696
01:03:47,526 --> 01:03:50,757
If not, he'll make sure
we suffer. Trust me.

697
01:03:50,796 --> 01:03:53,321
He has a lot of imagination.

698
01:03:53,365 --> 01:03:55,424
I want you to dance,
both of you.

699
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:07,307
(classical music continuing)

700
01:04:19,024 --> 01:04:21,822
- Now kiss!
- What?

701
01:04:21,861 --> 01:04:24,853
- I wanna see how you kiss, Sam.
- No way!

702
01:04:35,875 --> 01:04:38,173
Stop.

703
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:40,201
Enough.

704
01:04:43,582 --> 01:04:46,346
(sobs)

705
01:04:50,923 --> 01:04:52,891
Nice show,

706
01:04:52,925 --> 01:04:55,917
but don't touch her again
if you know what's good for you.

707
01:05:00,299 --> 01:05:02,927
Jimmy, Jimmy,
listen to me.

708
01:05:02,968 --> 01:05:05,903
You can't leave me
down here.

709
01:05:05,938 --> 01:05:08,566
Of course I can.
I can do whatever I want.

710
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:11,542
I'll leave the trapdoor open
so that when you look at the sky,

711
01:05:11,577 --> 01:05:13,044
you'll think of me.

712
01:05:13,078 --> 01:05:15,638
Keep the walkie on
so at least we can be close that way.

713
01:05:15,681 --> 01:05:17,672
I'll check in on you soon.

714
01:05:22,721 --> 01:05:25,087
How do I get out of here?

715
01:05:44,910 --> 01:05:46,901
Wait, is the garbage room
behind here?

716
01:06:24,483 --> 01:06:26,713
- Mom.
- Yes, dear.

717
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:30,088
Can I talk to you
about something?

718
01:06:30,122 --> 01:06:31,987
Sure.

719
01:06:32,024 --> 01:06:35,084
What?

720
01:06:36,895 --> 01:06:39,864
How do you know
when someone really loves you?

721
01:06:44,903 --> 01:06:47,701
That girl really had
an effect on you, didn't she?

722
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:49,970
Tell me.

723
01:06:51,243 --> 01:06:54,178
When you're willing to sacrifice
everything for someone.

724
01:06:57,049 --> 01:06:59,540
There's no great love
without it.

725
01:06:59,585 --> 01:07:02,110
Do you love me?

726
01:07:02,154 --> 01:07:04,281
Of course.

727
01:07:04,323 --> 01:07:07,724
Then why did you sacrifice me
for a dead man?

728
01:07:28,647 --> 01:07:31,047
(static hisses)

729
01:07:31,083 --> 01:07:34,246
Jimmy, can you hear me?

730
01:07:37,056 --> 01:07:40,048
Sam: Talk to me.
I know you're listening.

731
01:07:42,027 --> 01:07:45,394
I'm hurt, Jimmy.

732
01:07:45,431 --> 01:07:48,867
My ankle's really swollen.

733
01:07:48,901 --> 01:07:50,528
I need a doctor

734
01:07:50,569 --> 01:07:52,799
or at least medicine.

735
01:07:52,838 --> 01:07:54,669
Please.

736
01:07:54,707 --> 01:07:56,902
I know there's some ether

737
01:07:56,942 --> 01:07:58,933
and rubbing alcohol

738
01:07:58,977 --> 01:08:00,945
in my medicine cabinet.

739
01:08:00,979 --> 01:08:02,947
Please, Jimmy, I'm in pain.

740
01:08:02,981 --> 01:08:06,712
Remember the other night

741
01:08:06,752 --> 01:08:08,276
when you bandaged my knee?

742
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:09,719
That was great.

743
01:08:09,755 --> 01:08:11,950
I loved it.

744
01:08:11,990 --> 01:08:14,857
You took really good care
of me then.

745
01:08:14,893 --> 01:08:17,123
You know,
if we could be together,

746
01:08:17,162 --> 01:08:19,255
I could give you
so much more.

747
01:08:19,298 --> 01:08:22,859
Do you wanna know
what you're missing?

748
01:08:24,803 --> 01:08:26,430
Okay.

749
01:08:39,084 --> 01:08:42,247
Jimmy,
this is for you, okay?

750
01:09:06,845 --> 01:09:08,608
- (thunder crashing)
- (rain falling)

751
01:10:07,873 --> 01:10:09,898
(crying)

752
01:10:09,942 --> 01:10:12,308
(wailing)

753
01:10:32,531 --> 01:10:34,624
(thunder crashing)

754
01:11:04,296 --> 01:11:06,196
Do you feel guilty?

755
01:11:08,834 --> 01:11:11,860
He came here for you.

756
01:11:16,508 --> 01:11:19,807
Your wall has finished drying.

757
01:11:23,415 --> 01:11:26,942
5,106 days

758
01:11:26,985 --> 01:11:28,782
I've been trapped here

759
01:11:28,820 --> 01:11:31,721
since the day the police arrived

760
01:11:31,757 --> 01:11:34,191
and everything was ruined.

761
01:11:37,262 --> 01:11:39,162
Three weeks
after hiding here

762
01:11:39,197 --> 01:11:42,598
I discovered my only means
of escape was sealed up.

763
01:11:44,369 --> 01:11:46,360
It was Mary.

764
01:11:50,008 --> 01:11:52,169
She found me out.

765
01:11:52,210 --> 01:11:55,145
Mary fooled everybody.

766
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:57,080
She got to Sullivan's body

767
01:11:57,115 --> 01:11:59,982
and exchanged
his dental records;

768
01:12:00,018 --> 01:12:01,986
Put my ring on him

769
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:05,251
so the silly police
believed he had escaped

770
01:12:05,290 --> 01:12:08,657
and I was dead...
case closed.

771
01:12:08,694 --> 01:12:12,289
But here I am,
forever a prisoner.

772
01:12:14,967 --> 01:12:16,832
That won't work.

773
01:12:16,868 --> 01:12:19,837
When you finally accept

774
01:12:19,871 --> 01:12:23,602
you're trapped here
indefinitely,

775
01:12:23,642 --> 01:12:25,473
we can progress

776
01:12:25,510 --> 01:12:27,944
to a solution.

777
01:12:50,168 --> 01:12:53,296
- Come on!
- (explosion)

778
01:12:55,707 --> 01:12:57,368
What was that?

779
01:12:57,409 --> 01:13:00,537
Sounds like the pipes.

780
01:13:00,579 --> 01:13:02,342
No, it sounded
more like an explosion.

781
01:13:02,381 --> 01:13:05,475
It's the pipes.
They're falling apart.

782
01:13:05,517 --> 01:13:07,144
Jimmy.

783
01:13:07,185 --> 01:13:09,380
(coughs)

784
01:13:13,225 --> 01:13:14,692
Help.

785
01:13:14,726 --> 01:13:16,523
The Lighthouse
of Alexandria,

786
01:13:16,561 --> 01:13:18,654
the Temple of Artemis
destroyed;

787
01:13:18,697 --> 01:13:20,722
Gardens of Babylon,

788
01:13:20,766 --> 01:13:23,132
the Colossus of Rhodes
destroyed;

789
01:13:23,168 --> 01:13:25,864
The Seven Wonders
of the World demolished,

790
01:13:25,904 --> 01:13:29,738
burned, all except
the Great Pyramids

791
01:13:29,775 --> 01:13:33,404
and my buildings.

792
01:13:35,614 --> 01:13:37,912
Because both
the Egyptians and myself

793
01:13:37,949 --> 01:13:40,281
immured human beings
in our foundations.

794
01:13:40,318 --> 01:13:43,082
- Jimmy?
- All that counts is energy.

795
01:13:43,121 --> 01:13:45,521
The world found its light

796
01:13:45,557 --> 01:13:48,788
only through the birth pains
of agony and murder.

797
01:13:48,827 --> 01:13:52,763
Suffering
is a journey to purity,

798
01:13:52,798 --> 01:13:55,062
and death is the midwife

799
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:56,931
to eternal existence.

800
01:13:56,968 --> 01:13:59,528
You're completely insane.

801
01:13:59,571 --> 01:14:01,095
Would you like
to be eternal,

802
01:14:02,674 --> 01:14:04,301
Samantha?

803
01:14:09,147 --> 01:14:11,206
Eternal.

804
01:14:14,486 --> 01:14:16,477
You've made a big mistake
trying to escape,

805
01:14:16,521 --> 01:14:19,649
a big one.
I'm gonna punish you real bad.

806
01:14:19,691 --> 01:14:22,091
No more water,
no more food, no more light.

807
01:14:22,127 --> 01:14:24,857
You can think better
about your mistakes in the dark.

808
01:14:26,198 --> 01:14:29,133
Jimmy,

809
01:14:29,167 --> 01:14:31,226
what's going on?

810
01:14:36,875 --> 01:14:38,638
Mary, Mary,

811
01:14:38,677 --> 01:14:41,271
get me out of here!

812
01:14:41,313 --> 01:14:43,178
Mary!

813
01:14:43,215 --> 01:14:45,513
Please.

814
01:14:45,550 --> 01:14:48,212
No! Please.

815
01:14:49,855 --> 01:14:52,483
Mary, please!

816
01:15:00,766 --> 01:15:03,166
(yells)

817
01:15:03,201 --> 01:15:05,965
Do you realize
what you've done, Jimmy?

818
01:15:06,004 --> 01:15:08,495
What were you thinking
putting her in there?

819
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:11,976
Do you want me to go to jail
or some asylum and you in an orphanage?

820
01:15:12,010 --> 01:15:14,638
Is that what you want?

821
01:15:14,679 --> 01:15:17,580
Jimmy!

822
01:15:18,650 --> 01:15:20,345
What were you thinking?

823
01:15:22,754 --> 01:15:26,053
All those lives.

824
01:15:27,893 --> 01:15:30,191
All those lives.

825
01:15:32,197 --> 01:15:34,188
This was for them.

826
01:15:36,668 --> 01:15:39,034
Not you.

827
01:15:57,956 --> 01:16:00,015
Jimmy.

828
01:16:02,194 --> 01:16:04,162
I know you're there.

829
01:16:04,196 --> 01:16:06,494
Talk to me.

830
01:16:12,871 --> 01:16:15,431
Jimmy: Would you sacrifice
everything for me?

831
01:16:18,543 --> 01:16:21,535
Sam:
Yes, of course I would.

832
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:23,377
Jimmy:
I'm not stupid.

833
01:16:23,415 --> 01:16:25,440
Sam:
No, believe me.

834
01:16:25,483 --> 01:16:28,213
I'll sacrifice everything...

835
01:16:32,791 --> 01:16:36,022
everything
except my life.

836
01:16:36,061 --> 01:16:37,926
Because if I die,

837
01:16:37,963 --> 01:16:41,057
then we'll never get
to be together.

838
01:16:41,099 --> 01:16:43,863
I'll be gone forever.

839
01:16:45,103 --> 01:16:47,697
I'll just be a ghost,

840
01:16:47,739 --> 01:16:51,140
a ghost that'll haunt
every minute of your life,

841
01:16:51,176 --> 01:16:53,235
every single dream you have.

842
01:16:53,278 --> 01:16:55,212
When you wake up,
you'll realized that I'm not there

843
01:16:55,247 --> 01:16:57,647
next to you
because you didn't let me live.

844
01:16:57,682 --> 01:16:59,707
The one
who'll suffer most out

845
01:16:59,751 --> 01:17:01,878
of anyone is you, Jimmy.

846
01:17:04,522 --> 01:17:06,490
If I'm gonna learn
to love you,

847
01:17:06,524 --> 01:17:09,049
you have to let me live.

848
01:17:13,698 --> 01:17:16,667
It's too late.
The explosives people are here.

849
01:17:20,005 --> 01:17:22,235
Trust me.

850
01:17:26,778 --> 01:17:29,838
They already think
it's by chance you're here,

851
01:17:29,881 --> 01:17:32,577
that it was only
the boy's idea.

852
01:17:36,688 --> 01:17:38,952
It's your choice, Jimmy.

853
01:17:42,127 --> 01:17:46,086
- (static hissing)
- Sam, Sam!

854
01:17:46,131 --> 01:17:47,860
Can you hear me?

855
01:17:49,234 --> 01:17:52,101
If you wanna keep
any of this, take it now.

856
01:17:52,137 --> 01:17:53,604
Well, what about Sam?

857
01:17:53,638 --> 01:17:57,096
You should have thought
about that before, young man.

858
01:17:57,142 --> 01:17:59,167
We can't just leave her.

859
01:17:59,210 --> 01:18:01,678
Oh, yes, we absolutely can.

860
01:18:01,713 --> 01:18:03,704
We can't let her out now.

861
01:18:10,722 --> 01:18:14,590
That girl doesn't care
about you

862
01:18:14,626 --> 01:18:16,389
and you know that.

863
01:18:18,530 --> 01:18:20,521
I hope you know
what you're doing.

864
01:18:33,845 --> 01:18:35,836
This building's alive.

865
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:37,939
It has its own arteries,

866
01:18:37,983 --> 01:18:40,577
its own blood supply.

867
01:18:40,618 --> 01:18:42,950
Just like you.

868
01:18:42,988 --> 01:18:46,151
All that's missing is a soul.

869
01:18:46,191 --> 01:18:48,159
Mary: I don't know.
She seemed fine.

870
01:18:48,193 --> 01:18:50,161
She left in quite a hurry
with her friend.

871
01:18:50,195 --> 01:18:52,186
Man: Peter was gonna surprise her
and take her straight

872
01:18:52,230 --> 01:18:53,857
on the trip she got
from Dad.

873
01:18:53,898 --> 01:18:55,923
Still, you think she would
have called or something.

874
01:18:55,967 --> 01:18:58,458
Too bad she's gonna miss
her first demo.

875
01:19:35,073 --> 01:19:38,702
We'll be fine, ma'am.
You can go now.

876
01:19:43,882 --> 01:19:46,146
Help!

877
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:50,650
Save your energy,
Samantha.

878
01:19:50,688 --> 01:19:52,417
I still need you.

879
01:20:02,534 --> 01:20:04,229
Help!

880
01:20:04,269 --> 01:20:07,102
Patrick, Vincent!

881
01:20:07,138 --> 01:20:10,699
One must always
bury people alive.

882
01:20:10,742 --> 01:20:13,336
- No!
- It is essential

883
01:20:13,378 --> 01:20:16,347
for the victim to suffer.

884
01:20:54,519 --> 01:20:57,977
Flesh and foundation
must make one.

885
01:21:01,826 --> 01:21:05,023
The creator must fuse

886
01:21:05,063 --> 01:21:08,294
with his creation.

887
01:21:13,838 --> 01:21:15,965
(loud rumbling)

888
01:22:11,229 --> 01:22:14,892
I won't let you kill me!

889
01:22:14,933 --> 01:22:18,198
No, child,

890
01:22:18,236 --> 01:22:21,262
this is my tomb.

891
01:22:21,306 --> 01:22:24,036
You're supposed
to kill me in it.

892
01:22:27,478 --> 01:22:30,743
Now what are you waiting for?

893
01:22:30,782 --> 01:22:34,081
Do it yourself.

894
01:22:34,118 --> 01:22:36,848
You don't understand

895
01:22:36,888 --> 01:22:39,652
what we need you
to sacrifice,

896
01:22:39,691 --> 01:22:42,057
not some...

897
01:22:42,093 --> 01:22:43,993
worker's suicide.

898
01:22:44,028 --> 01:22:46,622
You're the one I chose to kill me.

899
01:22:46,664 --> 01:22:49,565
- I've waited so long.
- No.

900
01:22:49,601 --> 01:22:51,330
- Kill me.
- No.

901
01:22:51,369 --> 01:22:55,271
Listen to the anger,
