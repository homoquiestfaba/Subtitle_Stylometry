Ashes and Snow
[SUBS por Gonzzza]

2
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,500
If you come to me at this moment

3
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,450
Your minutes will become hours

4
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:53,500
Your hours will become days

5
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:59,500
And your days will become a lifetime

6
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,500
To the Princess of the Elephants

7
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,500
I dissapeared exactly one year ago

8
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:22,500
On that day, I received a letter

9
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,500
It called me back to the place
where my life with the Elephants began

10
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:36,000
Please forgive me for the silence between us
has been unbroken for one year

11
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,000
This letter breaks that silence

12
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,500
It marks the first of my
three hundred and sixty five letters to you

13
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,500
One for each day of silence

14
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:02,500
I will never be more myself,
than in these letters

15
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,500
They are my maps of the bird path

16
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,500
And they are all that I know
To be true

17
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:18,650
You will remember everything
All will be as before

18
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:28,500
In the begining of time,
the skies were filled with flying elephants

19
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,650
Every night they lay down
in the same place in the sky

20
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,500
And dreamt with one eye open

21
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,700
When you gaze up at the stars at night

22
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:54,750
You are looking into the unblinking eyes
of elephants, who sleep with one eye open

23
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,500
To best keep watch over us

24
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:08,500
Ever since my house burnt down
I see the moon more clearly

25
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,750
I gazed upon all the Edens that have fallen in me

26
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,750
I saw Edens that I had held in my hands,
but let go

27
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,750
I saw promises I did not keep

28
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,500
Pains I did not sooth

29
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,700
Wounds I did not heal

30
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,750
Tears I did not shed

31
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,450
I saw deaths I did not mourn

32
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,500
Prayers I did not answer

33
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,500
Doors I did not open
Doors I did not close

34
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,500
Lovers I left behind

35
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,450
And dreams I did not live

36
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:09,750
I saw all that was offered to me,
that I could not accept

37
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,500
I saw the letters I wished for,
but never received

38
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:23,500
I saw all that could have been,
but never will be

39
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:13,500
An elephant with his trunk raised
is a letter to the stars

40
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,500
A breaching whale is a letter
from the bottom of the sea

41
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,500
These images are a letter to my dreams

42
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,500
These letters are my letters to you

43
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:28,500
My heart is like an old house,
who's windows have not been opened for years

44
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:39,550
But now I hear the windows opening
I remember the cranes floating above
the melting snows of the Himalayas

45
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:43,500
Sleeping on tails of manatees

46
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,800
The songs of the bearded seals

47
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,900
The bark of the zeebra

48
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,800
The clicks of the sand

49
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,500
The ears of the caracals

50
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,450
The sway of the elephants

51
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:07,500
The breaching of whales

52
00:29:07,501 --> 00:29:11,800
And the silhouette of the eland

53
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,900
I remember the curl of the meerkat's toes

54
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,850
Floating on the Ganges

55
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,800
Sailing on the Nile

56
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,800
Ascending the steps of ****** *****

57
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:42,800
I remember wandering through the corridors
of Hatshepsut and the faces of many women

58
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,500
Endless seas and thousands of miles of rivers

59
00:29:50,000 --> 00:30:10,800
...I remember father to children...
...And the taste...I remember...
...and the pealing of the peach...

60
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,500
I remember everything

61
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:24,000
But I do not remember ever having left

62
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,500
remember your dreams

63
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,200
remember your dreams

64
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,500
remember your dreams

65
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,500
remember

66
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:09,450
The longer I watch the Savanna elephants,
the more I listen, the more that i open,

67
00:32:09,451 --> 00:32:12,450
they remind me of who I am

68
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:19,500
May the guardian elephants hear my wish
to collaborate with all the musicians of nature's orchestra

69
00:32:19,501 --> 00:32:29,000
I want to see through the eyes of the elephant
I want to join the dance that has no steps

70
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,500
I want to become the dance

71
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:55,500
I can't tell if you are getting closer or farther away

72
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,500
I long for the serenity I found
when I looked upon your face

73
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,500
Perhaps if your face could be returned to me now,

74
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I would find it easier to recover
the face I seemed to have lost

75
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,500
My own

76
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,700
Feather to fire
fire to blood

77
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:28,500
blood to bone
bone to marrow

78
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:32,600
marrow to ashes
ashes to snow

79
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,500
feather to fire
fire to blood

80
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,800
blood to bone
bone to marrow

81
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,500
marrow to ashes
ashes to snow

82
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,500
feather to fire
fire to blood

83
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,500
blood to bone
bone to marrow

84
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
marrow to ashes
ashes to snow

85
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,500
feather to fire
fire to blood
blood to bone

86
00:44:12,505 --> 00:44:16,500
bone to marrow
marrow to ashes
ashes to snow

87
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,500
feather to fire
fire to blood
blood to bone

88
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:31,500
bone to marrow
marrow to ashes
ashes to snow

89
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,800
feather to fire
fire to blood

90
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,500
blood to bone
bone to marrow

91
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,500
marrow to ashes
ashes to snow

92
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:40,000
The whales do not sing because they have an answer.

93
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,500
They sing because they have a song.

94
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,000
What matters, is not
what is written on the page,

95
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:04,000
what matters, is
what is written in the heart.

96
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,500
So burn the letters
And lay their ashes on the snow

97
01:01:12,550 --> 01:01:18,000
At the river's edge
When spring comes and the snow melts

98
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:23,500
And the river rizes
Return to the banks of the river

99
01:01:23,501 --> 01:01:26,500
And reread my letters with your eyes closed

100
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Let the words and the images
wash over your body like waves

101
01:01:34,005 --> 01:01:40,000
Reread the letters,
with your hand cupped over your ear

102
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,500
Listen to the songs of Eden

103
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,500
Page, after page, after page

104
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,500
Fly the bird path

105
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Fly

106
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,500
Fly

107
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:04,000
Fly
