00:00:09,221 --> 00:00:12,138
(slow piano music)

4
00:00:14,572 --> 00:00:15,588
- That's it.

5
00:00:15,588 --> 00:00:17,555
I'll see you at the new place, okay?

6
00:00:17,556 --> 00:00:18,507
Thank you.

7
00:00:18,507 --> 00:00:21,470

(tense music)

10
00:00:27,574 --> 00:00:28,693
- I need you.

11
00:00:28,693 --> 00:00:31,276
- Ashley, we have to get going.

12
00:00:35,692 --> 00:00:38,442
The moving truck is already gone.

13
00:00:40,092 --> 00:00:43,092
(slow, tense music)

14
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,300
Ashley, enough.

15
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:52,643
Come on.

16
00:00:52,643 --> 00:00:53,476
- No.

17
00:00:55,778 --> 00:00:57,216
No!

18
00:00:57,216 --> 00:00:58,504
No!

19
00:00:58,504 --> 00:00:59,608
You can't sell this place,

20
00:00:59,608 --> 00:01:02,358
you can't take me away from here!

21
00:01:03,395 --> 00:01:06,395
(slow, tense music)

22
00:01:09,373 --> 00:01:11,540
(gasping)

23
00:01:15,611 --> 00:01:17,378
- Unleash the power of the ancients with

24
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:19,357
this protection spell.

25
00:01:19,357 --> 00:01:21,859
- The guardian of the house must stay.

26
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:24,324
She shall never leave.

27
00:01:24,324 --> 00:01:27,324
(slow, tense music)

28
00:01:30,292 --> 00:01:31,709
- Ashley, please.

29
00:01:33,918 --> 00:01:37,251
(tense, dramatic music)

30
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:45,099
Ashley, please.

31
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:49,240
(screaming)

32
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:56,913
(groaning)
(squelching)

33
00:02:00,851 --> 00:02:03,851
(slow, tense music)

34
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,590
(Ashley humming)

35
00:02:11,337 --> 00:02:13,754
(squelching)

36
00:02:15,294 --> 00:02:18,627
(tense, dramatic music)

37
00:02:27,496 --> 00:02:28,565
- Oh shit!

38
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:32,208
Jessa! We gotta fuck go, we gotta go.

39
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,816
Fuck, shit, dude.

40
00:02:33,816 --> 00:02:35,071
We need to get the fuck out of here.

41
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,154
Taylor has lost her mind.

42
00:02:38,118 --> 00:02:41,118
(slow, tense music)
