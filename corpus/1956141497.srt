1
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:31,615
<i>I am the jungle's eyes.</i>

2
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,826
<i>I can see the past...</i>

3
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:37,079
<i>and the future.</i>

4
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,792
<i>It is I, Kaa,</i>

5
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:45,504
<i>who witnessed the coming of man...</i>

6
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,551
<i>and the jungle...</i>

7
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:53,470
<i>trying to survive.</i>

8
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,813
<i>I saw chaos</i>

9
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,775
<i>and darkness come to our lands.</i>

10
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,847
<i>I saw the tiger, Shere Khan,</i>

11
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,682
<i>killing man</i>

12
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:44,396
<i>and breaking the jungle's ancient law.</i>

13
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,295
<i>And then,</i>

14
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,714
<i>one fateful night,</i>

15
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:14,635
<i>I saw the jungle place its hopes</i>

16
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:16,094
<i>into the hands</i>

17
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,222
<i>of a small creature,</i>

18
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,642
<i>the like of which</i>

19
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,228
<i>it had never seen before.</i>

20
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:36,902
How did it get here?

21
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:38,695
I don't know.

22
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:41,989
Is it hurt?

23
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,290
There's no wound.

24
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:53,251
It's on its own.

25
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,213
I've never seen a man-cub before.

26
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,296
It's so...

27
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,217
small.

28
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,469
It doesn't fear us.

29
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,098
What are we going to do with it?

30
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,687
Evening, Nisha.

31
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:13,813
Vihaan.

32
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:18,360
- It's a lovely night, isn't it?
- What is it that you want, Tabaqui?

33
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,362
What's that I smell? Fresh kill?

34
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,322
If it's bones you're after,
look elsewhere.

35
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,991
We have enough mouths to feed.

36
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,079
I meant no harm, Nisha.

37
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,340
Your master calls.

38
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,050
You best go quickly.

39
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,845
He sounds in ill temper tonight.

40
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,596
That he does. That he does.

41
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,475
And with good reason.

42
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:56,398
I found the man-cub! I found the man-cub!

43
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,774
Finish cleaning him off.

44
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,109
- Nisha.
- Clean him!

45
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,194
- Where are you going?
- To Akela.

46
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,114
A council must be held
if we are to keep him.

47
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,658
- Keep him?
- Don't let him out of your sight.

48
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,119
We can't keep him!

49
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:23,258
Nisha, you have called council.
What's the matter at hand?

50
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,302
We've found...

51
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,638
a man-cub.

52
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:36,146
- That's not a wolf.
- That doesn't belong here.

53
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,024
A man-cub! Outrageous.

54
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,735
Well, this is most unusual indeed.

55
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:46,489
Nisha, you wish to raise this cub
as if he were your own?

56
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:48,325
I do.

57
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,159
And Vihaan?

58
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:51,952
You, too?

59
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:54,039
I do.

60
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,290
It's a man-cub!

61
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,541
You know the law.

62
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,170
This cub was not born among us.

63
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,299
So, who here speaks for the cub?

64
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,093
I speak for the cub.

65
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:12,349
The law states that the life of a cub

66
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,017
may be bought,

67
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:15,477
for a price.

68
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,188
I brought my payment.

69
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:19,772
We have one.

70
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,360
Who else will speak for the cub?

71
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,277
Baloo does.

72
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:26,571
Baloo?

73
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:30,033
- Bagheera...
- He's not a wolf. He has no say.

74
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,836
He was the teacher of your cubs.
That makes him a member of the pack.

75
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:36,122
I ain't speakin' for no...

76
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:37,958
man-cub.

77
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:42,671
Bagheera, have you lost your mind?
A man-cub living in a jungle?

78
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,604
Akela,

79
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,439
his parents will come.

80
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:07,278
His parents are dead.

81
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,031
I killed them.

82
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:15,412
There is no one to come looking for him.

83
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,749
This is not your concern, Shere Khan.

84
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,376
The cub is mine.

85
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:24,504
I have already tasted its mother's blood.

86
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,799
It is my right.

87
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,968
Your right according to who's law?

88
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,261
Best you leave now.

89
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,973
Careful, Akela.

90
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:38,184
You do not want to challenge me.

91
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,062
This cub...

92
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,232
is under the protection of the pack.

93
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,193
Should you decide to take me,

94
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,071
you take on the pack.

95
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,240
All of us.

96
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:57,579
As long as I am leader,

97
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,915
this part of the jungle is closed to you.

98
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,964
You cannot be leader forever.

99
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,717
The day you miss your kill,

100
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,512
the man-cub's blood

101
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:18,808
will run down my chin.

102
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,363
The cub is spoken for.

103
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,074
He is one of us.

104
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,659
You will teach him as you would your own.

105
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,912
As long as I am alive,

106
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,706
the pack will stand by the man-cub.

107
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,863
Hunting is sacred, little brother.

108
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,740
It is our right.

109
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:02,912
But we never do it for sport.

110
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:22,432
Wait. Wait.

111
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,436
We look them in the eye

112
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:28,938
so that the soul

113
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,274
doesn't depart alone.

114
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,978
Bagheera.

115
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,908
How old is the jungle, Bagheera?

116
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:25,411
The jungle has been here
since before you were born

117
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,288
and it will be here...

118
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,001
after you die.

119
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,837
The jungle is eternal.

120
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,798
Bagheera...

121
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:42,428
why am I different to the other wolves?

122
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,771
You are no different,

123
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,648
little brother.

124
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,443
You are special.

125
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,113
<i>Of course you're different.</i>

126
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,283
That's why you need special training.

127
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,618
You know what your trouble is?

128
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,453
Lack of focus.

129
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,121
Baloo,

130
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,457
how many ants can you fit in your mouth?

131
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,376
Ants are really small

132
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:15,837
and your mouth is really big.

133
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,424
- I bet...
- Mowgli, will you concentrate?

134
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:27,431
Do...

135
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,349
not...

136
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,477
move.

137
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,902
- Why do I have to do this?
- 'Cause I said so.

138
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,696
Tell me the three laws, now.

139
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,573
"No wolf shall have contact with man."

140
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,116
- Next.
- Baloo...

141
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,328
- what happened to your tail?
- Next!

142
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,663
"No wolf shall hunt man's animals.

143
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:54,000
Above all, the cow, which is sacred!"

144
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:57,545
Did it fall off?
Is that why you don't have one?

145
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,547
What? Why haven't you got a tail?

146
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,258
I don't know.
I never really thought about it.

147
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,509
Third law.

148
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:04,635
Now!

149
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:08,264
"No wolf shall kill man in the jungle,
for killing man only brings danger."

150
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,350
Oh, well. Least you know your laws.

151
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:13,519
Now, we just got to get you
to run as fast as the other wolves.

152
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,401
Don't let your guard down.

153
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,197
All right,
that's enough for today, Mowgli.

154
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:29,202
Straight back to the caves.
No wandering. Run like a wolf, d'you hear?

155
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,121
I can't hear you!

156
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:12,995
Mowgli!

157
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,914
Hey, Mowgli.

158
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,625
- Bhoot!
- What are you doing?

159
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,086
- Nothing.
- Hey, do you want to play?

160
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,755
Got ya!

161
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,052
Oh, I nearly had you.

162
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:30,972
You're good at hiding.

163
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:34,767
Mum taught me how to hide.
She shows me loads of tricks.

164
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:37,770
So I can protect myself.

165
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:40,523
She says, "Others can mistake

166
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,817
individuality for weakness."

167
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,486
That's why they have a go at me sometimes.

168
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,113
Yeah.

169
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:49,698
Me, too.

170
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,993
Come on. I'll race you home.

171
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,121
On my call...

172
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:57,164
Go!

173
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,304
Hey.

174
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:14,681
Hey, brother.

175
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:17,643
What did Baloo make you do today?

176
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:20,104
Put a scorpion on me
and told me not to move.

177
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,939
He says I lack focus.

178
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,150
Baloo says that to all of us.

179
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,819
- How was your lesson?
- Fine.

180
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,706
Your brother tells me
you're getting faster.

181
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,698
He can nearly keep pace with me.

182
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,241
He can almost beat Bhoot.

183
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,203
Yeah, he should just race
with his freak friend!

184
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:37,747
It's only natural they spend
so much time with each other.

185
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,373
Freaks have to stick together.

186
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,002
That's enough.

187
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:45,796
That really hurt.

188
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,880
Inside, now.

189
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:48,965
Thanks.

190
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,636
You shouldn't let them pick on you
like that.

191
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,804
We were only playing.

192
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,139
Better go home, Bhoot.

193
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:56,806
Bye, Mowgli!

194
00:16:57,141 --> 00:17:00,019
I meant what I said to Mum.
You are getting faster.

195
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,902
Your father was never
much of a runner either.

196
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,774
It's true. I was the slowest in my group.

197
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,902
I never thought I was gonna complete
in the Running. I was sure I would fail.

198
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:11,614
- You're going to be late.
- Have a good hunt, Father.

199
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:15,034
Before you know it, you'll be coming along
with me. All of you!

200
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,664
- Good hunting!
- Good hunting all!

201
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:31,592
This is the jungle!

202
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:35,263
In the jungle, we all hunt.

203
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:36,681
And...

204
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:39,392
we are all hunted.

205
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:41,018
You see what that means.

206
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:43,229
It means that you...

207
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,314
you don't want to get caught.

208
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,695
That's why you can't join the pack

209
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,532
until you have passed the Running...
Pay attention!

210
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,623
"What's the Running, Baloo?"

211
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,919
The Running is the hunt where you...

212
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,213
are the prey.

213
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,050
Now, Bagheera here...

214
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:14,927
You all know Bagheera, don't you?

215
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,721
Yeah, Bagheera, friendly Bagheera.

216
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,433
In the Running, Bagheera will hunt you,

217
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,934
and if he catches you...

218
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,728
you fail.

219
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,564
What happens if you fail?

220
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,608
You don't join the pack!

221
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,365
But I've never had one of my cubs fail.

222
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,661
And I'm not gonna start now.

223
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:45,999
Good.

224
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:47,710
Let's practice, shall we?

225
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:53,674
On my call.

226
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,470
Wait... wait...

227
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,264
Go!

228
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,808
Come on, now!

229
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,020
Pick up the pace!

230
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,275
Come on!

231
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:14,487
Faster!

232
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,715
You were with the monkey-people

233
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,090
again.

234
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,555
The monkey-people have no law,

235
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,598
they're unpredictable,

236
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,475
and they can't even speak proper.

237
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,563
- I think they're funny.
- There's nothing funny about them.

238
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,314
You keep away, do you understand?

239
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:36,193
- I'm not afraid of them.
- Only fools feel no fear, Mowgli.

240
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,029
The monkey-people are especially foolish.

241
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,990
There's nothing they're afraid of.

242
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,451
Well, except Kaa.

243
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,704
Oh, they can't even lay eyes on her.

244
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:47,787
Who's Kaa?

245
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,499
Oh, you don't want to meet Kaa.

246
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,127
Kaa the Python

247
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,254
is as old as the jungle.

248
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,758
She sees the past...

249
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:00,760
and the future.

250
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:06,014
Turn around!

251
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:10,977
Eyes forward.

252
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:21,280
The cow had been killed
and left there to be found.

253
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:27,578
- It's the tiger! He's come back!
- Only Khan would kill man's cattle.

254
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,498
- One man-cub will bring more men!
- It's Shere Khan!

255
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:32,917
Akela, we knew this would happen!
We told you!

256
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,337
Can't you see, Akela,
the man-cub is putting us all in danger.

257
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:40,591
- You were wrong to ever take him in!
- We should give him to the tiger!

258
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,593
- Akela, no!
- Save the pack!

259
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,135
Please.

260
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,056
He is one of us.

261
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,894
I will see to this matter.

262
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,561
Go!

263
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:07,576
Shere Khan wants to bring war
to the jungle.

264
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:09,702
War?

265
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,957
With man? Is he out of his mind?

266
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,040
War with me.

267
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,419
He knows I'm getting old.

268
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,548
This is his way of bringing chaos
to the pack.

269
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:24,009
- Khan wants the boy.
- We can protect him.

270
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:26,971
You know there is only one way
to protect him.

271
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,431
He must go to the man village.

272
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,684
You're forgetting, Bagheera,

273
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,895
this was always more
than just a good deed.

274
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,939
The jungle is changing.

275
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:41,443
Man is taking more of it
as each season passes.

276
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:43,736
And the boy

277
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:47,700
may just be our only hope of survival.

278
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,870
The jungle is no longer safe for him.

279
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:55,165
- The pack won't accept him.
- They will if he passes the Running.

280
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,126
Baloo, is he ready?

281
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,628
Of course he's not ready.
He's not a wolf.

282
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,005
Then make him ready.

283
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:09,388
Right, no more messing about.

284
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:12,099
Can you run as fast as a wolf?

285
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:13,726
No, you can't.

286
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:18,606
You've got hands with fingers on the ends,
so let's use them.

287
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:19,689
What?

288
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:22,401
Now jump, to there.

289
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:24,445
Come on, hurry up.

290
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:33,536
Again.

291
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:36,916
Oh, nearly!

292
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:46,800
- Yes!
- Baloo!

293
00:26:58,117 --> 00:26:59,117
What happened?

294
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,103
Come on, little brother.

295
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:27,645
Time to go home.

296
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,130
Do you know why those men have come?

297
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:59,761
They've come to hunt the tiger
that steals their cattle.

298
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:02,264
- Will they kill him?
- It won't be easy.

299
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,435
Shere Khan is clever.

300
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,188
Very dangerous.

301
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:13,774
Mowgli...

302
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,196
the jungle is no longer safe for you.

303
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:23,076
But if you were to be in a place
where Shere Khan would never go,

304
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,204
then you would be safe.

305
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,165
Where does Shere Khan never go?

306
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:32,669
You know, the man village.

307
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,504
Why would I go there?

308
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,595
Because you are a man-cub.

309
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:47,017
I have seen the way
you look at the village.

310
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,562
You are one of them.

311
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:53,106
I'm a wolf.

312
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,233
Mowgli...

313
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,740
He wants your blood, little brother.

314
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,910
It was Shere Khan
who killed your man-parents

315
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,662
all those seasons ago,

316
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,706
and now he wants to kill you.

317
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,668
The pack will protect me.

318
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,294
If you fail the Running...

319
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:15,254
I won't fail.

320
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:16,337
...you won't...

321
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:18,674
be able to join the pack.

322
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:20,634
I won't fail!

323
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:23,762
Then promise me this.

324
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,723
If you do fail...

325
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,601
you will go to the village.

326
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:32,187
Promise me, Mowgli.

327
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,756
Good evening!

328
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,407
Don't worry. I'll kill your tiger.

329
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:27,117
How many's he taken this time?

330
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,201
Careful!

331
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:30,746
Quickly, now. Come on.

332
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,871
Did you smell the blood, man-cub?

333
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:15,290
What is it?

334
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:23,090
- The creature that did that to your tail.
- It's called "fire."

335
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,634
It's hotter than the sun.

336
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,970
And it's quicker than the panther.

337
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,225
Your kind use dark magic, man-cub.

338
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,851
They're not my kind.

339
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:42,525
Sometimes...

340
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:45,362
I dream I'm a tiger.

341
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:49,157
But I always wake up a hyena.

342
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:14,391
You should try and get some sleep.

343
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:21,648
You'll want to be rested for tomorrow.

344
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,201
What's bothering you, my love?

345
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:36,746
All I've ever wanted...

346
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,375
my whole life...

347
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,712
is to be a wolf.

348
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:50,177
For the others to see me as an...

349
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,345
equal.

350
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,935
This is my chance to prove myself.

351
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,105
To prove that I'm one of them.

352
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:05,400
To prove that I belong.

353
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:06,485
You belong.

354
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:11,865
You belong, Mowgli.

355
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:17,787
Don't ever let anyone
make you think otherwise.

356
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:23,668
You will always be my son, Mowgli.

357
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:28,131
Nothing can ever change that.

358
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:01,081
You are about to take part

359
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,333
in one of our oldest traditions.

360
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,586
The Running of the Pack.

361
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,464
Those of you who pass the test...

362
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:12,342
will have earned the right...

363
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,301
to join us

364
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,054
in the night hunt.

365
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,684
As is customary...

366
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,604
Bagheera will perform his task as chaser.

367
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:29,025
Mowgli!

368
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:30,986
Good luck, Mowgli!

369
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,330
Face the hill.

370
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:49,796
Good luck, brother.

371
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:54,175
I must warn you,
Bagheera has been told not to hold back.

372
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:00,974
On my call.

373
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:07,981
Go!

374
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:20,826
Bagheera.

375
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,620
If you will.

376
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:07,957
Out of my way, freak!

377
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,409
Let him go, Bagheera.

378
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:09,578
Bagheera...

379
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:33,477
Get up.

380
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,709
You let your guard down.

381
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:01,881
I told you, never let your guard down.

382
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:03,383
He was only chasing <i>me.</i>

383
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:04,843
He targeted<i> me.</i>

384
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:06,386
He knows I'm the weakest.

385
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,978
All of your lessons...

386
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:17,272
they mean nothing!

387
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:22,402
Mowgli!

388
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,153
Bagheera! He's fine.

389
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,029
Let him be.

390
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,782
See ya, freak!

391
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:24,589
Hey, Mowgli.

392
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:41,272
I saw that look in your eye

393
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:43,107
when you were standing over him.

394
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:45,735
I did what I did because I had to.

395
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,445
Do you think I am stupid?

396
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,906
I saw what you did!

397
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:55,662
Help! Help! Help!

398
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:57,288
He was in the lead!

399
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,332
I trained that boy!

400
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:01,250
Why did you have to do that?

401
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:02,794
He had to fail!

402
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:07,090
Why can't you see how much danger he's in?

403
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:10,009
The pack would have protected him!

404
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:16,307
Khan will kill him
and tear the pack apart.

405
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:19,602
You are not the only one

406
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:21,604
who cares about the boy.

407
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:24,524
All you care about is that he passed.

408
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:28,319
That is because it's my job!

409
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,114
Bagheera! Baloo! Up here!

410
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,241
Mowgli's been taken by the monkey-people!

411
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:40,707
Mowgli!

412
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,189
Let go!

413
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:09,485
Let me go!

414
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:02,723
My, my.

415
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,686
How you've grown.

416
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:14,819
And how much chaos
you brought upon the pack.

417
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:20,867
So much more...

418
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:23,578
to come.

419
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:35,172
Just...

420
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:38,676
a little taste.

421
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:52,272
Mowgli!

422
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,015
Bagheera!

423
00:45:56,879 --> 00:46:00,341
Let the man-cub alone.

424
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,051
He belongs...

425
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:04,095
to us.

426
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:48,430
Kaa...

427
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,811
She saved me.

428
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:01,776
Why?

429
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:24,967
Good hunting!

430
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:26,969
Good hunting all!

431
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,015
Good hunting!

432
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:32,641
Good hunting all!

433
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:36,479
Mowgli!

434
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:38,271
Hey, Mowgli.

435
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:45,279
Don't worry.

436
00:47:45,738 --> 00:47:47,490
We'll get to join them soon enough.

437
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:48,908
I just know it.

438
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:53,704
Mum says some wolves just need more time.
It doesn't mean we're not good enough.

439
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,582
Hey, why don't we have our own night hunt?

440
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:59,126
Just you and me. What do you say?

441
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:08,260
You've been spending a lot of time
on your own since the monkey-people.

442
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:09,887
It's not good to be alone.

443
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,690
Wolves are supposed to be
with other wolves.

444
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:12,722
I'm not a wolf.

445
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,355
Of course you are, Mowgli.

446
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:20,898
You're the best wolf I know!

447
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:23,984
Why do you always want to be
around me, Bhoot?

448
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,237
'Cause you're my best friend, Mowgli.

449
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:37,498
I understand what it's like.

450
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:40,251
For nobody to want you.

451
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:46,173
I don't have any friends neither.

452
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:48,217
But...

453
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,510
we have each other.

454
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:51,846
And we're kind of same, you and me.

455
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,055
We're not the same.

456
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:54,306
Of course we are.

457
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:56,559
Because you're special and I'm special.

458
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:58,477
We're not special!

459
00:48:59,228 --> 00:49:00,312
Don't you get it?

460
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:03,566
We'll never be one of them!
We're freaks!

461
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:06,485
You're not special, Bhoot!

462
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:10,865
It's just something your mother tells you
to make you feel better about yourself

463
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,492
because you came out wrong!

464
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:32,427
Bhoot...

465
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:34,847
Bhoot, I'm sorry.

466
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:39,994
Kaa?

467
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:45,917
Kaa?

468
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,003
Well,

469
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:50,631
look who's here.

470
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,093
It's the man-cub,

471
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:58,055
his destiny still uncertain.

472
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:02,309
Are you afraid of me, man-cub?

473
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,311
No.

474
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:09,066
Sometimes, fear...

475
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:12,736
is the only intelligent response.

476
00:51:16,365 --> 00:51:17,408
Don't you think?

477
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:25,708
Say something...

478
00:51:28,711 --> 00:51:30,462
or I shall get bored.

479
00:51:33,674 --> 00:51:35,884
And when I get bored...

480
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,637
I get hungry.

481
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:42,056
Is it...

482
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:46,854
Is it true that you know the past
and the future?

483
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:50,065
What is it you want from me,

484
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:51,567
man-cub?

485
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:54,153
Why did you save me
from the monkey-people?

486
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:58,824
Why do you think
the elephant saved you from the tiger pit?

487
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:05,039
The whole jungle has been watching you,
man-cub.

488
00:52:06,415 --> 00:52:07,415
Why?

489
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:11,545
Even you must know you are unusual.

490
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:16,091
Not quite a wolf,

491
00:52:16,175 --> 00:52:17,593
not quite a man...

492
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:19,469
or neither...

493
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,096
or both.

494
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:44,161
I think we can both agree, Mowgli,

495
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:49,166
that you are something
the jungle has never seen before.

496
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:56,757
Every day,

497
00:52:57,466 --> 00:53:00,344
you grow a little older.

498
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:02,471
Every day,

499
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:06,308
you come a little closer.

500
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:10,729
One day you will fight...

501
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:12,022
and kill.

502
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:17,277
One day you will speak...

503
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:21,115
and the jungle will listen.

504
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:31,041
What will you say then, man-cub?

505
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:36,295
Do you hear?

506
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,053
The entertainment...

507
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,222
commences.

508
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:49,393
I shall be watching.

509
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,609
You have no right to be here, Shere Khan!

510
00:53:58,527 --> 00:54:02,990
Well, I think you'll find
I stay where I please.

511
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:09,037
You kill man's cattle.
You poison the jungle.

512
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:11,290
You're the reason man is here!

513
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:14,585
But <i>you</i> permitted man to live among you.

514
00:54:14,877 --> 00:54:17,796
<i>You</i> pretend he is a wolf.

515
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:21,091
When we both know
that is the one thing he will never be.

516
00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:24,386
He will always be

517
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:26,180
a man.

518
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:28,014
<i>You...</i>

519
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:30,809
poisoned the jungle.

520
00:54:32,478 --> 00:54:35,564
But you're no longer leader now,

521
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:36,647
are you?

522
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:38,650
You missed your kill.

523
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:43,989
By your law...

524
00:54:45,741 --> 00:54:46,784
your pack...

525
00:54:48,035 --> 00:54:49,328
must challenge you.

526
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:56,001
Akela's missed his kill!
Akela's missed his kill!

527
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:04,092
As is our tradition,
whoever defeats me...

528
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:06,845
will become leader of the pack.

529
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:21,984
What's happening?

530
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:26,907
Mowgli!

531
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,158
It's the law.

532
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,002
Who's next?

533
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:45,944
Who's next?

534
00:56:46,028 --> 00:56:47,029
No!

535
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:48,322
Mowgli!

536
00:56:56,288 --> 00:56:57,288
No!

537
00:57:11,053 --> 00:57:16,808
If I ever see you here again,
I will set your hide ablaze

538
00:57:16,892 --> 00:57:19,227
and watch you burn alive!

539
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:22,940
I will taste your blood,

540
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:24,900
man-cub.

541
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:37,411
Leave.

542
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,126
What?

543
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:45,962
You have...

544
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:49,007
turned the weapons of man...

545
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:51,134
upon us.

546
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:55,931
You have brought the pack great shame.

547
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:57,849
You have brought me...

548
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:00,519
great shame.

549
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:03,938
Leave.

550
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:10,869
Bagh...

551
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:21,256
Hello, little brother.

552
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:26,511
I knew you'd come.

553
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:30,640
I knew you'd rescue me.

554
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:34,560
Mowgli...

555
01:03:38,273 --> 01:03:40,108
I have not come to rescue you.

556
01:03:41,693 --> 01:03:43,486
I've come to tell you to stay.

557
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:46,905
What?

558
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:58,960
You must stay in the village.
You must not come back to the jungle.

559
01:03:59,044 --> 01:04:02,505
- But the jungle is my home.
- No, it isn't. Not anymore.

560
01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:04,382
I can't stay here.

561
01:04:05,884 --> 01:04:07,677
- Yes, you can.
- I can't.

562
01:04:07,761 --> 01:04:10,096
You will learn to understand their ways.

563
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:11,264
You may even grow...

564
01:04:12,474 --> 01:04:13,475
to like it.

565
01:04:15,018 --> 01:04:16,061
It will be all right,

566
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:17,562
little brother.

567
01:04:17,645 --> 01:04:20,857
How do you know? You've never spent a day
outside the jungle.

568
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:29,949
I was born among man.

569
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:37,624
I bear the marks of a collar.

570
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,251
Under my chin.

571
01:04:44,756 --> 01:04:47,801
I lived in a king's palace
in a cage just like this.

572
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:49,761
Fed through a slot.

573
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:53,056
Man's entertainment.

574
01:04:55,934 --> 01:04:58,937
I only heard stories about the jungle.

575
01:05:02,399 --> 01:05:03,566
When I found you...

576
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:06,361
all those seasons ago...

577
01:05:09,197 --> 01:05:10,865
I saw something in you.

578
01:05:12,492 --> 01:05:15,829
And I thought I could teach you.
I thought I could...

579
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:20,208
teach you how to belong.

580
01:05:21,209 --> 01:05:23,336
To be like everyone else.

581
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:28,508
But I was wrong, Mowgli.

582
01:05:29,134 --> 01:05:30,802
You weren't wrong.

583
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:36,141
I was wrong.

584
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:40,186
Bagheera!

585
01:05:42,105 --> 01:05:43,565
I love you.

586
01:05:55,827 --> 01:05:57,245
I was another panther...

587
01:05:58,037 --> 01:05:59,372
in that cage, Mowgli.

588
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:01,665
I bit...

589
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:03,793
and I scratched...

590
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:08,047
and I spent my entire life fighting.

591
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:11,091
Until one day...

592
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:13,595
I just stopped.

593
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:19,142
I stopped fighting.

594
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:23,813
And I gained their trust.

595
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:27,233
Gain their trust, little brother.

596
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:37,577
Bagheera!

597
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:41,039
Don't leave me here.

598
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,835
Come back!

599
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:06,290
Hey!

600
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,175
You're a fast learner.

601
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:03,431
Prefer mine cooked.

602
01:09:11,356 --> 01:09:12,899
I noticed your scar.

603
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:22,824
Tiger.

604
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:28,831
Looks like we've both got the same enemy.

605
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,288
It's nothing to worry about.

606
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:13,668
It's all right, it's nothing.

607
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:54,208
Here, you can keep this one.

608
01:12:52,118 --> 01:12:53,995
It's so you can hunt.

609
01:13:01,252 --> 01:13:02,252
There.

610
01:13:56,724 --> 01:13:57,724
Hello, brother!

611
01:13:59,602 --> 01:14:00,728
Hello, Mowgli.

612
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:06,108
You look different.

613
01:14:14,575 --> 01:14:15,660
Why are you here?

614
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:17,244
It's Shere Khan.

615
01:14:18,204 --> 01:14:19,288
He's taken over.

616
01:14:20,206 --> 01:14:21,624
We've had to leave home.

617
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:23,834
Those of us
who still stand by Akela, anyway.

618
01:14:23,918 --> 01:14:26,003
And... the others?

619
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:28,464
They come in groups, in the night.

620
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:30,841
Threaten us.

621
01:14:31,842 --> 01:14:32,969
Our own people.

622
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:37,306
It's not my problem anymore.

623
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:39,350
- Mowgli...
- It's not my problem.

624
01:14:39,433 --> 01:14:41,852
We've been pushed to the very edge
of the jungle.

625
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:44,981
And Khan won't stop killing man's cattle.

626
01:14:45,398 --> 01:14:46,398
Brother...

627
01:14:48,109 --> 01:14:50,277
We're afraid of what man might do to us.

628
01:14:54,073 --> 01:14:55,825
The pack needs you, Mowgli.

629
01:14:57,910 --> 01:14:59,996
They didn't need me when I was cast out.

630
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:07,919
Please!

631
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:10,839
Come home.

632
01:15:20,975 --> 01:15:22,309
This is my home now.

633
01:17:01,742 --> 01:17:02,785
Lockwood,

634
01:17:04,537 --> 01:17:08,624
when will you kill the tiger?
He has killed many cattle.

635
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:10,376
A clever beast.

636
01:17:12,837 --> 01:17:14,588
Knows how to cover his tracks.

637
01:17:16,799 --> 01:17:20,302
Have you ever missed?

638
01:17:21,262 --> 01:17:22,346
Just once,

639
01:17:23,514 --> 01:17:24,514
just once.

640
01:17:27,017 --> 01:17:29,019
Tiger?

641
01:17:31,689 --> 01:17:32,731
Elephant.

642
01:17:37,027 --> 01:17:39,280
I did get one of his tusks, though.

643
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:43,325
I have never missed a kill since.

644
01:17:52,835 --> 01:17:55,421
I will get your tiger.

645
01:17:59,258 --> 01:18:01,468
I have no doubt, I will get him.

646
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:06,347
I will get him.

647
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:05,718
Beautiful...

648
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:07,802
isn't he?

649
01:20:12,182 --> 01:20:13,809
My first albino.

650
01:20:18,397 --> 01:20:19,440
And this

651
01:20:19,982 --> 01:20:22,985
is my own personal menagerie.

652
01:20:29,783 --> 01:20:32,619
You don't understand

653
01:20:33,787 --> 01:20:35,998
a word I'm saying,

654
01:20:36,081 --> 01:20:37,081
do you?

655
01:20:43,714 --> 01:20:45,674
We can't all be scholars.

656
01:20:49,595 --> 01:20:51,597
Because God knows I'm not.

657
01:22:48,672 --> 01:22:51,341
I will show you the hunter
who took this...

658
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:55,929
if you help me rid the jungle
of the tiger.

659
01:23:00,476 --> 01:23:03,312
Shere Khan has brought us
nothing but chaos.

660
01:23:11,487 --> 01:23:13,739
Akela, we must kill the tiger.

661
01:23:15,866 --> 01:23:17,618
I would rather die

662
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:20,829
than break with the laws of the jungle.

663
01:23:21,788 --> 01:23:22,789
And our people...

664
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:25,250
your friends...

665
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:27,210
are with me.

666
01:23:28,462 --> 01:23:31,006
But I'm not bound
by those laws anymore, Akela,

667
01:23:31,089 --> 01:23:33,509
and this is not the jungle
you once knew.

668
01:23:34,384 --> 01:23:35,761
When you were a cub,

669
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:39,014
I looked you in the eye and saw no fear.

670
01:23:39,473 --> 01:23:44,811
I believed then that one day
you would bring peace to the jungle.

671
01:23:46,688 --> 01:23:49,066
But you have become a man now, Mowgli.

672
01:23:49,608 --> 01:23:50,776
I am not a man.

673
01:23:52,277 --> 01:23:53,737
But neither am I a wolf.

674
01:23:59,993 --> 01:24:02,788
- Which of you will follow me?
- We can't, Mowgli.

675
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,709
The jungle law is sacred.

676
01:24:11,213 --> 01:24:12,214
Bagheera.

677
01:24:20,681 --> 01:24:22,641
Tomorrow, the tiger dies.

678
01:25:09,229 --> 01:25:10,314
Khan!

679
01:25:16,903 --> 01:25:19,615
Khan!

680
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:21,199
The boy needs us, Akela.

681
01:25:25,495 --> 01:25:27,706
Here I am!

682
01:25:30,709 --> 01:25:33,086
Khan!

683
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:58,320
Look at you,

684
01:25:58,403 --> 01:26:02,908
using a man's tool to do your killing.

685
01:26:05,452 --> 01:26:08,163
What would Baloo and Bagheera think?

686
01:26:18,215 --> 01:26:20,092
What's he doing?

687
01:28:22,964 --> 01:28:24,216
There's your hunter!

688
01:28:39,606 --> 01:28:40,607
Let's go.

689
01:29:12,305 --> 01:29:14,307
You know, I can still hear

690
01:29:14,975 --> 01:29:16,643
your mother's screams

691
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:20,188
the night I took her life.

692
01:30:35,221 --> 01:30:36,221
Akela!

693
01:30:41,937 --> 01:30:45,982
Forgive me for doubting you, Mowgli.

694
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:51,947
It is your time now.

695
01:30:57,577 --> 01:30:58,828
Lead them.

696
01:33:45,578 --> 01:33:47,497
Sleep now, Shere Khan.

697
01:33:48,873 --> 01:33:50,250
Be angry no more.

698
01:34:27,453 --> 01:34:31,416
<i>With the tiger and the hunter now gone,</i>

699
01:34:31,958 --> 01:34:36,004
<i>the future shimmered from darkness...</i>

700
01:34:36,546 --> 01:34:37,797
<i>into light.</i>

701
01:34:38,965 --> 01:34:40,300
<i>Mowgli,</i>

702
01:34:40,592 --> 01:34:42,719
<i>man and wolf,</i>

703
01:34:42,802 --> 01:34:44,888
<i>both and neither,</i>

704
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:48,600
<i>had given the jungle a voice.</i>

705
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:51,895
<i>And for as long as he stood watch,</i>

706
01:34:51,978 --> 01:34:56,733
<i>it would speak a lasting peace.</i>
