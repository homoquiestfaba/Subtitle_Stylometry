1
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,640
Oh. my...!

2
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,160
What are you doing?
You're driving me crazy.

3
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,240
Well, it's a gift.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,840
- Don't stop.
- Right there?

5
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,920
Yes. Yes.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,680
- That feel good?
- Yes.

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,880
Thought so.
Who's your daddy? Me?

8
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,560
Oh, yes.

9
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,440
Listen, I was gonna get up and feed
the fish and maybe grab a cup of coffee.

10
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,000
- That OK?
- Yes!

11
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:57,080
Oh, yeah. Might make a couple of pieces
of toast. Would you like a slice?

12
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,000
Yes.

13
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,400
Terrific. You're the best.
Same time tomorrow?

14
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,360
Yes!

15
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,360
Fantastic.

16
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,760
Stanley!
Stanley, happy Halloween.

17
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,200
- Hi, Frank. No costume today?
- Nah.

18
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,160
Hey, what you got there?

19
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,400
- No way.
- Come on.

20
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,320
Thought you said you wanted to be
down to fighting weight by Christmas.

21
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,480
- Did you cheat over the weekend?
- No.

22
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,480
- Stay strong.
- Look, look, I'm fat.

23
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,960
There, I said it. It's not gonna make
a difference. Give me a donut. Come on.

24
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,200
You look great, OK?
So just stick with it.

25
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,960
- Good to see you.
- Come on.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,440
I'm-I'm a big guy. I'm a big guy.
What does it matter? One donut.

27
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,480
I told you I wanted that
information first thing in the morning.

28
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,040
Take a look at my watch, buddy boy.
It's a quarter to 11 and I don't see it.

29
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,520
Let me tell you something: your
performance is lackluster, at best!

30
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,320
I did it. I just don't
know where I put it.

31
00:02:24,321 --> 00:02:26,040
Can I bring it to you in an hour?

32
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,400
In an hour?
You might not have a job in an hour.

33
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,500
- What?
- What do you mean, what?

34
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,760
What do you think you're gonna do,
pick up a paycheck every two weeks

35
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,040
and just sit at your desk
and play grab-ass all day, huh?

36
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,200
Is that what you think?

37
00:02:36,201 --> 00:02:37,420
Hey, guys, I'm trying
to get a little...

38
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,760
Oh, sorry, Dave. I didn't see
that was you. What's going on?

39
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,080
What's going on is Rob's about to

40
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,840
find himself out of a job,
that's what's going on.

41
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,800
Yeah, I can't find where I put the pages
on the Lasky account.

42
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,840
Aw, no, the one you were
working on yesterday?

43
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,160
Yes! Yes.

44
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,160
- You worked all day on that, man.
- I know, day and night.

45
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,480
I mean, it's not to worry, 'cause
I sent it down to personnel, yeah,

46
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,240
- so it's all taken care of.
- What?

47
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,960
I knew that they needed it
and I know that he'd finished it,

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,520
so I just figured
I'd run it down there myself,

49
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,120
like what you were
talking about last week,

50
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,720
just taking care of
stuff when we see it,

51
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,680
not waiting for somebody else to do it,
so I just got it down there.

52
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,200
I want you to track down that report.
I need that report.

53
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,200
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,560
- Idiots! Idiots.
- I'm really sorry, Dave.

55
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,600
You got, like, uh, maybe an hour.

56
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,320
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah, yeah.

57
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,000
Whoa. Dave.

58
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,480
Look at that.
Tremendous outfit, my man.

59
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,560
Very nice.
Really strong.

60
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,200
- I'm a pirate.
- Oh. You're a pirate.

61
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,840
- Yeah.
- I see. Terrific.

62
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,720
- Hey, guys, Dave's a pirate.
- Oh, really?

63
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,160
That's awesome.
See you, Dave.

64
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,320
- Hey, you guys see the new girl?
- No. Where?

65
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,520
She's fine.
She just went around the corner.

66
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,200
- Who are you? What is this?
- I'm your dad.

67
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,400
- Come on.
- No, it's like a tribute, man.

68
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,720
I'm your dad.
What have you got going?

69
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,000
Clark Kent. See?
No, hold on. You gotta do...

70
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,760
- I like that.
- It's all right. I like it. That'll go.

71
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,760
What's-what's this action here?
What've you got?

72
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,320
This action is called corporate climber.

73
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,280
Get it? Corporate... climber.

74
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,000
That's great.

75
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,240
- I mean, that's kinda weak.
- No, man, it's not cool, not cool.

76
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,840
- Hey.
- Stanley's dad. That's good.

77
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,200
- Did you guys see the new girl?
- I know. She's hot.

78
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,840
- Smokin'.
- Yeah.

79
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,840
OK, everybody, listen up.
Gather around.

80
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,200
All right, let me introduce
this lovely young lady to my right.

81
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,440
Her name is Diana Evans.

82
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:05,400
All right, Diana's gonna be helping us
beef up our corporate division.

83
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,800
Let me tell you some things about her.
She's young. She is aggressive,

84
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,040
and we're happy and lucky to have her.
Diana.

85
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,680
Well, thank you
for that lovely introduction, Mr. Sykes.

86
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,920
I was just hoping to
slip on through here.

87
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:24,080
Everyone looks so great.

88
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,120
- Happy Halloween.
- Happy Halloween.

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,520
Well, I'm really looking forward
to working here

90
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,920
and I promise next year
I will wear a costume, really.

91
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,120
And if you have any questions
or you just wanna say hello,

92
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,120
you're welcome to come by
my little cubicle anytime.

93
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,480
Especially the gentleman in the back,

94
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,640
with the white button-down
and the gray tie.

95
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,400
- Who? Me?
- Yeah, you.

96
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,320
I have been waiting
my whole life for you.

97
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,000
And here you are.

98
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,920
You are my reason, my purpose,

99
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,440
my destiny.

100
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,600
Wow.

101
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,920
Thank you very much and I look
forward to talking with all of you.

102
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,400
Diana.

103
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,520
I'm gonna ask her out.

104
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,480
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

105
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,760
- Yeah.
- You should. Today?

106
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,520
- Maybe.
- Tonight?

107
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,520
Maybe.
Maybe tomorrow.

108
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,160
OK, boss, this is your chance.
Yeah!

109
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,880
Oh, no.
Meter maid, 2:00.

110
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,400
Lovely Rita, my ass.
We gonna help this guy out?

111
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,320
Who's got a quarter?
Come on. Who's got one?

112
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,200
- I don't have any pockets.
- I got one, I got one.

113
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm gonna put it right by him.
Come on.

114
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,600
What a sweet thing to do!

115
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,720
- Oh!
- Nice toss.

116
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,720
Uh, OK, I don't care.

117
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,200
You tell them I need the files on that
Henderson account by 3 pm today.

118
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:27,400
Yeah, by 3pm today. Yeah. Stanley
Milton. That's right. Troubleshooter.

119
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,480
No, that's why they brought me in.
Look, I skipped business school, OK?

120
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,560
No, you tell Faraday
he can shove it up his ass.

121
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,480
Yeah, no, no. Yeah.
And listen, if he wants to talk to me,

122
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,200
you tell him that there
are four elevators

123
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,400
and two flights of stairs that lead
all the way up to the 12th floor.

124
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,860
You're not talking
to anybody, are you?

125
00:08:43,861 --> 00:08:45,240
Hold on.

126
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,360
No.

127
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,560
It's not a sweatshop.
They're all legal.

128
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,840
- Why are you still pretending?
- 'Cause it's fun.

129
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,640
- Hang up.
- I gotta go. Yeah.

130
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,840
- Are you ready?
- For what?

131
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,560
- I have some news.
- What kind of news? Lay it on me.

132
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,440
She broke up with her boyfriend.

133
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,720
- Diana.
- Diana?

134
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,720
Yeah. Diana.

135
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,760
The interesting thing about this fund
is it can also invest

136
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,840
in sponsored or unsponsored ADRs -
they're issued by our banks...

137
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,320
evidencing their ownership
in specific foreign securities.

138
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,360
The value of these convertible
securities is a function of

139
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,960
its yield in comparison
with the yields of other securities...

140
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,680
Kill me.

141
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,960
- This is it! Right?
- Yeah.

142
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,400
There's you, there's the woman
you've been in love with from afar.

143
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,460
There's the midget she's been dating.
He's out of the picture.

144
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,840
Opportunity.
Window.

145
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,120
I understand. I'm just not ready.
I got this.

146
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,400
- Just talk to me.
- Women love you, right?

147
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,660
Nancy constantly eying
the package, always

148
00:09:57,661 --> 00:09:59,880
staring at it, sizing it up, right?

149
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,960
- The girl from the dim sum.
- Clare.

150
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,040
- Clare. There you go.
- A lot of hang-ups, Clare.

151
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,520
What about the girl from Deja Vu?
Oh, my God! That girl was all over you.

152
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,920
You went there and immediately
she was just creeping on you and...

153
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,160
Remember that? Touching up on you.
She loved you, that girl.

154
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,080
It was a lap dance.

155
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,480
Still...

156
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,880
I think this mess has gone on
long enough. I gotta tell you.

157
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,180
I think you've waited
entirely too patiently

158
00:10:27,181 --> 00:10:29,400
through entirely too many boyfriends.

159
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,960
The talk about the warm,
fuzzy feeling you got

160
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,480
when you saw her in the elevator
makes me sick.

161
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,800
- Bye. Have a good day.
- Yeah.

162
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,560
You have planned out every second

163
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,480
of what you hope will be
the perfect evening.

164
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,280
Starting out in the right place
with a little cocktail,

165
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,580
bringing it over for
some theater, then

166
00:10:50,581 --> 00:10:52,840
you bring it back to
the restaurant. Nya!

167
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,480
- Seal the deal at the capper table.
- Capper table?

168
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,360
It's your idea.
I'm just giving it a name.

169
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,400
I mean, that's what you're gonna do.
You're gonna cap off your evening.

170
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,800
That sounds sleazy,
and this is not sleazy.

171
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,080
- Do you understand that?
- Shut up! OK? Just shut up.

172
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,000
That's it.
You are ready.

173
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,480
- This is it?
- Yes, this is it.

174
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,320
- And let me tell you why.
- 'Cause now we got window.

175
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,480
That's right.

176
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,360
You're ready to throw in the towel
and I'm telling you,

177
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,400
- this is the perfect, shining moment.
- Right.

178
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,240
When one man has not measured up

179
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,480
and the next man, he hasn't summoned
the courage, the strength,

180
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,440
to reach deep within himself

181
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,920
to draw forth the sword
from the stone...

182
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,160
- That is Diana.
- Yes! Now we got window.

183
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,400
We got the window. That's
the window you were talking about.

184
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,000
- What have we got? Oh, it's window.
- You were telling me about it.

185
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,200
- And now I'm telling you about it.
- Window!

186
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,680
It's a window!

187
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,200
- Window! Window!
- Shut up! On the phone here.

188
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,200
We got window.

189
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,440
Conference room.

190
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,600
- Oh, that was funny.
- What are you doing?

191
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,400
You don't just say "Oh, that was funny."
You have to laugh.

192
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,400
Right.

193
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,440
All right.
You're killing me here, OK?

194
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,400
Look, hold it.

195
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,880
This is polished.
This whole thing is honed.

196
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:26,160
Do it like Ted just told you the joke
three seconds ago. You come in...

197
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,840
You know, it gives you
this great energy going in,

198
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,800
and then you ask her how she's doing.

199
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,720
- Then...
- Great. Sorry to hear that.

200
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,120
- Depending on what she says.
- There you go.

201
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,520
- Then you segue right to the joke.
- Now, what if the joke fails?

202
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,000
It doesn't matter. It's Ted's joke.
Make fun of Ted. He's an idiot.

203
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,120
- That's the genius of this.
- So, is it on?

204
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,720
- Yeah.
- Yeah, man. It's on. It's on.

205
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,200
What's up!
You are the man.

206
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,280
You're laughing, you're smiling.
That's when you slip in the casual date.

207
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,000
- Stanley. Good luck!
- Thanks.

208
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,860
It's just a thing.
It's just very casual.

209
00:13:01,861 --> 00:13:03,680
That's what it is.
It's a casual thing.

210
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,720
- That's the whole key.
- It's a casual thing. And there she is.

211
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,320
Oh, God.

212
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,920
I need to check out the card.

213
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,840
- And...
- Please don't do.

214
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,840
- Jeez, tell me about it.
- Hm?

215
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,160
- Am I getting ahead of you?
- Well, sort of. Uh...

216
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,400
We can't understand what you're saying.

217
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,840
Well... whose fault is that?

218
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,880
Yours. It's your fault.
We asked you to come down here today

219
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,320
because we want a
better understanding of

220
00:13:36,321 --> 00:13:38,680
how our divisions could work together.

221
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,520
We're tired of our customers leaving us
to go to Bear Stearns or Merrill Lynch

222
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,960
or whoever else they're going to.

223
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,280
We didn't get that from you.

224
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,680
So now you can go back to
your little cubicle

225
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,560
and get back on the horn,
comfortable in the knowledge that

226
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,040
the nine people
you had lunch with today,

227
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,200
along with everyone else
that banks with us,

228
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,280
knows less about investing than you.

229
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,400
Hm.

230
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,400
That'll do it.

231
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,240
Just kinda launch in...

232
00:14:13,241 --> 00:14:14,920
You don't need this.
Forget about this.

233
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,080
- OK? You got it.
- I'd like to just take a look.

234
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,280
No, you don't need it.
This isn't for you.

235
00:14:19,281 --> 00:14:21,400
You have it up here. Get rid of that.

236
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,880
Here we go.
Where's mad dog? Come on.

237
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,560
- Thank you, thank you, thank you.
- You're quite welcome.

238
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,120
- Mad dog. You're the mad dog!
- She's on the rebound, man.

239
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,800
And I think someone else heard us too.

240
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,120
Diana.

241
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,640
- That was funny. How are you?
- Uh, good.

242
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,040
- How are you?
- Good, great. Sorry to hear that.

243
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,840
I figured I'd give you a few options,
you know.

244
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,640
- Thank you.
- Sure.

245
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,760
Joke.

246
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,560
Say, Ted in the mailroom
just told me a hilarious joke.

247
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,440
Really funny.
Have you got a minute?

248
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,400
Sure.
But can you walk me to my office?

249
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,000
- Yeah, yeah.
- Thanks.

250
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,960
Apparently there was this magician
and he's playing to a packed audience,

251
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,080
and for his big finish,

252
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,680
he kind of forces this big guy
from the audience to volunteer.

253
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,320
Well, he gets the big guy up on stage
and he says to him

254
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,080
"I want you to hit me over the head with
this sledgehammer as hard as you can."

255
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,960
Then the magician leans
over and whispers

256
00:15:26,961 --> 00:15:28,800
to him "Don't worry, it's a trick,"

257
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,400
and then winks at him.
So the big guy takes the sledgehammer,

258
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,960
raises it high into the air
and then hits him

259
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,480
the magician, right over the head
with it as hard as he can.

260
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,320
- Oh, my God!
- Right, exactly.

261
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,280
The magician just collapses,
goes down cold.

262
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,080
They rush him to the hospital where he
slips into a coma. Six months go by,

263
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,120
and he's sitting by the magician's
bedside, just like he always is,

264
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,400
and he notices the magician's hand
start to twitch, and then his arm.

265
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,440
The big guy, he can't believe it.
This guy hasn't moved for months.

266
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,000
- Kevin. Line one.
- I'll call him back.

267
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,680
Then suddenly,
he sits straight up in bed,

268
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,880
raises his arms above his head
and screams "Ta-da!"

269
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,040
That is so funny!

270
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,360
- That's Ted's joke?
- Oh, well, yeah, his premise. I mean,

271
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,620
I kinda fine-tuned
it and fleshed it out.

272
00:16:19,621 --> 00:16:21,800
Very funny. Do you wanna come in?

273
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,680
- Sure.
- Come on in.

274
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,000
- Stanley's gonna ask out Diana?
- Yeah.

275
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,920
- She'll eat him alive.
- Care to put some money on it?

276
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,920
Say, my best friend from college,

277
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,680
my college roommate,
he just won a trip to Aruba

278
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,320
and he can't use his tickets
to the theater tonight,

279
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,080
so... I mean, I know this is
very short notice and everything,

280
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,080
but I was just gonna
run the idea by you...

281
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,720
Sure.
That'd be nice.

282
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,000
Excuse me?

283
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,680
No, no, it's totally casual, you know.

284
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,920
I'd probably just give 'em away
otherwise. No big deal.

285
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,920
Believe me, I'm in the
mood for totally casual.

286
00:16:57,921 --> 00:16:59,840
I need totally casual.

287
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,840
Great, yeah.

288
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,040
That's what it is, you know.
It's just casual. It's no big deal.

289
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,680
Great.
Well, here is my address.

290
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,920
Oh, yeah. Sure.

291
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,800
- Do you mind picking me up at seven?
- Not at all. There it is.

292
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,800
Yeah.

293
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,940
I don't mean to be rude
or anything, but I

294
00:17:20,941 --> 00:17:23,360
kinda have a lot of
phone calls to make.

295
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:28,080
Tell me about it. I'm swamped out there.
I've got a million things going on.

296
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,200
- Yeah. Uh...
- Well, this'll be fun, Steve.

297
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,040
- Great. So I'll see you at seven.
- Seven. Bye.

298
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,040
It's Stanley.

299
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,760
But who wants to get technical
about something like that?

300
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,760
No way.

301
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,520
God, you're a pimp.

302
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,800
We're with you.
We're with you, my brother.

303
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,280
Ride!
Like the wind!

304
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,880
For the man?
Five bucks, huh?

305
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,520
Against?

306
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,320
$20. There's a believer. Yeah.

307
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,200
Look at that.
Management showing up.

308
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,400
Two to one after 12.
The overnight date pays five to one.

309
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,640
He's very strong.
After midnight pays two to one.

310
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,720
I think Stanley's
gonna get some pudding.

311
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,320
I think it's sweet.

312
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,800
Oh. God. This guy
is so not right for you.

313
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,520
I know.
He's kind of dorky and goofy.

314
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,240
But every other guy I've been attracted
to, it turns out to be a disaster.

315
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,480
Maybe that's something
you need to look into.

316
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,240
- There's gotta be one prince out there.
- Oh. God.

317
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,360
Your white knight
who's noble and strong,

318
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,640
who opens car doors and writes poetry.

319
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,760
You're looking for a guy who slays
dragons, and - hi! - Chivalry's dead.

320
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,120
So I'll just lower my standards and stay
with some jerk who treats me like shit.

321
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,720
There's gotta be someone
out there for me.

322
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,040
- Where's he taking you?
- To the theater.

323
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,800
Boring!
Smells like a "home early."

324
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,240
Doubt it. I'm sure he'll use the old,
"Let's go grab a bite to eat."

325
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,640
What time does the play start?

326
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,480
- Eight.
- OK. You're home by 10:30.

327
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,320
- Oh, crap!
- What?

328
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,720
Oh, nothing.
I'm making this bowl for my mom,

329
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,600
and every time I try to make the lip, it
turns into this great big enormous turd.

330
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,920
Well, maybe that's something
you need to look into.

331
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,920
- Home early.
- Sarah.

332
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,240
- I'll pray I'm wrong.
- Bye.

333
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,320
It's showtime.

334
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,480
Just act normal.
Just act relaxed.

335
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,400
Oh!

336
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,440
- So this is casual?
- Oh, yeah.

337
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,040
Should I change?

338
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,120
- No. Should I change?
- No, no.

339
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,400
You look great. I mean, yeah.
Jeans, that's great.

340
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,360
They were originally a working pant

341
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,200
in the Bay area
during the gold-rush days.

342
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,560
Oh, yeah, I guess...

343
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,480
This is kind of a suit. Here,
I got you these. It's kind of a mix.

344
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,920
Thank you.
They're so pretty.

345
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,720
Oh, yeah, sure.
I mean, most of 'em are real, I think.

346
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,000
- I'm kidding. They're all real.
- Hang on one second.

347
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,440
- OK.
- I'm gonna go bring this up.

348
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,240
I used to like my college bowl...

349
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,600
- Hey, Michael.
- Dave. What's up, man? How are you?

350
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,400
- Hey, Ted. Who called you?
- Good to see you.

351
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,000
How's the holding hands?
Have they done that?

352
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,000
Can you give me 100 on holding hands?

353
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,600
- Yeah, I'll put you down for 100.
- OK. I have no cash.

354
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,400
All right, that's it.
Bets are locked, all right.

355
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,080
Get your money down. If you don't get it
down now, don't say I didn't warn you.

356
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,400
It didn't sound right
when I said it, so I'm sorry.

357
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,160
So, Stanley, I apologize profusely.

358
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,960
Steve. Great name. Not mine, but...

359
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,680
Apology accepted.
Thank you.

360
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:56,440
Anyway, what a great idea
to grab a drink.

361
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,560
- It's very pretty.
- Oh, yeah.

362
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,720
- Roses?
- Ma'am, I don't wanna buy no roses.

363
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,400
I'm alone.
I'm not buying a rose for my bread.

364
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,280
Now don't you get no ideas about them.

365
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,280
I saw what you did
to this chump over here,

366
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,880
selling roses for $5 a pop. It's just
a weed with some red leaves on it.

367
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,200
Now get your ass up outta here.
I see how you pressin' in on the boys,

368
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,160
making 'em feel bad in front
of their girlfriends.

369
00:22:20,161 --> 00:22:22,240
Bunch of player haters. God!

370
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,480
- So what are we seeing, by the way?
- It's called America. It's historical.

371
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,600
Reality-based. The kid
at the college newspaper loved it.

372
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,400
It's a monologue, so the characters,
they talk one at a time.

373
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,480
Oh! Well, that way we would
know what they're saying.

374
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,800
- I get it.
- Yeah, OK.

375
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,120
No, but it is supposed to be
very good. Interesting.

376
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,960
Oh, I'm sure it'll be fine.
I'm really excited to see it.

377
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,800
And then, you know,
afterwards, if we're hungry,

378
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,040
we can go find someplace,
get a bite to eat.

379
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,200
You know, I know a great new...

380
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,160
Hey, you just relax.

381
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,160
I'll be in charge of
the dining situation.

382
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,520
All right.
I see.

383
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,600
So, what are you getting to drink?

384
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,040
I don't know.
What are you gonna have?

385
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,440
Hey, you said relax,
so why don't you just order for me?

386
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,800
My dad used to do that,
yeah, when we were kids.

387
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,160
Sometimes we'd love it,
sometimes we'd hate it.

388
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,200
We never knew what we were gonna get.

389
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,560
My dad's whole thing is, you just
gotta grab the bull by the balls.

390
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,960
- That's horns.
- My dad always said balls.

391
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,280
- Roses?
- Uh, we're friends. It's casual.

392
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,000
She's just a coworker.
Thank you.

393
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,240
Roses for the girlfriend?

394
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,520
I bought her flowers earlier.
Thank you, though.

395
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,480
And they were so beautiful,
so thank you.

396
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,760
Roses for the girlfriend.

397
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,320
Roses for the girlfriend?

398
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:55,120
- OK, give me one.
- One? Just one?

399
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,280
OK.
How much for all these?

400
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,000
- Oh, what are you doing, Stanley?
- How much for everything?

401
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,400
75.

402
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,280
I have to call Michael.
I gotta tell him about this.

403
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,880
- Hello.
- Michael. It's Tee.

404
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,520
- Yeah, how's our boy doing?
- Weak.

405
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,840
Your boy just spent $75 on a rose.

406
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,240
Well, I mean, they're still
at the restaurant, right?

407
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,760
Yeah. True that.

408
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,680
All right.
You keep it real, man.

409
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,760
Vanilla Ice says that
they've arrived at the restaurant

410
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,320
and they're still together.

411
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,440
So, Tim,

412
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:39,680
Sarah... oh! Cliff and Marv.
See you, wouldn't wanna be you.

413
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,080
You can stick around for the party
stuff, but you're out of the pool.

414
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,160
Don't ever bet against my boy!
Ted, take over the board.

415
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,920
I gotta get to the theater.
Marilyn, let's go.

416
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,800
OK. OK.
I'm in control.

417
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,680
So the next big payoff is going to be

418
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,760
non lip-lip lingering physical contact
prior to the show.

419
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,440
And that's gonna go off at ten to one.

420
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,400
- I have a question.
- What?

421
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,740
- Brief question.
- You have a question?

422
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:05,440
Yeah. What are the odds
of them having no contact?

423
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,600
He doesn't touch her.
Nothing at all.

424
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,480
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Worry about
your own bets. He's not the only one

425
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,220
who thinks Stanley
doesn't have a shot.

426
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:14,880
You don't have a shot.

427
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,400
- You didn't have to do that.
- No, I wanted to.

428
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,240
- Uh-uh, no, you didn't.
- Yeah, I did.

429
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,480
I mean, the flower lady's a heck of
a closer. I just got a little confused.

430
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,720
You know, I didn't know whether to
buy one or just the whole basket,

431
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,680
and then she kind of
backed me into a corner.

432
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,200
- Well, one would have been fine.
- Really?

433
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:36,880
Is that...? You just never know
what to do. I felt weird.

434
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,960
Do you know no one
has ever given me just one flower?

435
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:47,400
This is so sweet of you, but there's
just, you know, something so elegant...

436
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,120
maybe not this one -
about a single rose.

437
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:56,520
Just... a single white rose.

438
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:04,360
That sounds great. I...
Would you excuse me for a moment?

439
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,840
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.

440
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,680
- Careful.
- Be right back.

441
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,000
This is Michael. I'm out there
somewhere. Releasing the giant Within.

442
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,920
I hope you're out there
doing the same thing.

443
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,040
Michael, are you there?
Pick up. Michael.

444
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,880
Oh, God. OK, two things. One: did you
get the index card from Diana's office?

445
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,040
Please tell me you did. Please.
And I need a huge favor.

446
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,680
I need you to go buy a single white rose

447
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,640
and then place the rose
near the capper table.

448
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,200
And please get this. All right?
Please do this. I gotta go.

449
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,920
I gotta go.
Bye.

450
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,000
- Thank you.
- Sure, sure. There you go.

451
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,440
It's unlocked.

452
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,160
Come on, now.

453
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,360
It's unlocked.

454
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,200
I think I was unlocking it
while you were locking it.

455
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,040
Off to the theater.

456
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,800
Stanley!

457
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,880
Wait a second!

458
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,760
- Oh, my God!
- Man down, man down.

459
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,020
- I didn't even see him.
- Oh, my God.

460
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,320
He came out of nowhere.

461
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,880
- I'll call 911.
- No, I'm fine, I'm fine. I just...

462
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,520
- I'm so sorry. Are you sure you're OK?
- I think I soiled my pants.

463
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,880
- Stanley, be careful.
- OK, well, don't move, don't move.

464
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,360
- I'll try. I...
- Show's over, folks. Go ahead.

465
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,200
Come on. Let's go. See, he's fine,
he's fine. Show's over. Thanks.

466
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,760
Just try and get your knees
under your body.

467
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:08,920
You're sliding me under the car.
I've got that.

468
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,560
I just wanna figure out if anything's
broken. You got it there?

469
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,400
- Let's try and get...
- This is good.

470
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,880
OK. There you go.
Get your knees under you there.

471
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,560
Thank you.
Thank you.

472
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:23,000
Just walk it off here.
Here, we'll have a seat right here.

473
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,080
There you go.

474
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,760
I think I'm OK.

475
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,880
Oh!

476
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,000
- My animals!
- What?

477
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,320
My animal collection,
they're-they're-they're broken.

478
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,040
- OK, how many?
- I don't know. 14.

479
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,000
No, 13. I traded one for...

480
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,740
How much were they?

481
00:28:42,741 --> 00:28:44,400
I don't know. I got
'em at different times

482
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,720
They're all different prices.
It's all... This is moving too fast.

483
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,040
If you had to put a dollar amount on it,
what would it be?

484
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,440
200?

485
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,640
- Dollars?
- Come on, buddy! Move the car!

486
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:00,360
I... I had a... a lion, a chimp,

487
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,360
and a squirrel, a rat...

488
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,160
OK, $200.

489
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,000
A mole. That's what it was.
It wasn't a rat.

490
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,960
- I'm gonna write you a check.
- It's like a rat...

491
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,080
- I don't take checks.
- What, it's against your policy?

492
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,120
No, I don't...

493
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,560
- I don't have a check-cashing card.
- Check-cashing card? So what?

494
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,340
It doesn't matter. The
branch is right there.

495
00:29:25,341 --> 00:29:27,040
You just go there and you cash it.

496
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,200
- Please be nice.
- OK. What's your name?

497
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:34,560
- Phil.
- OK, Phil. Hi.

498
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,000
Nice to meet you.
How can I help you?

499
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,800
By not hitting me with your car again.
That'd be a big help.

500
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,440
I promise I won't hit you with my car
again. Now, what can I do for you?

501
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,920
Make me new animals.

502
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,120
I don't have a Bunsen burner
and, you know, like a long metal tube.

503
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,920
- Oh, that's how...?
- Gentlemen.

504
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,880
Why don't we just go to an ATM?

505
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,540
That way you could give
Phil his money and

506
00:29:58,541 --> 00:30:01,080
we could just make it to the theater.

507
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,160
I'm really sorry.

508
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,040
Just take care of it.
Just pay him. Just get rid of him.

509
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,320
- Well, this is cozy.
- Yeah.

510
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,240
Isn't it?

511
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:27,040
- I think there's blood in my hip.
- You got blood in your hip?

512
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,680
- I can feel it swelling.
- Really?

513
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,520
- You smell good.
- Thank you. So do you.

514
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,480
What is that?
Old Spice?

515
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,040
Ford Taurus.

516
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,480
You sure you don't wanna
get checked out or anything?

517
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:48,480
I'm fine, I'm fine.
What's with all the flowers?

518
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:52,480
Well, Stanley bought all those for me.
Aren't they pretty?

519
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,480
Yeah. Yeah.

520
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,880
- You guys on a date?
- No, no, we're just friends from work.

521
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,600
- You know. It's casual.
- He asked me to the theater tonight.

522
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,000
- Oh.
- Yeah.

523
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,320
- How's it going?
- Good.

524
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,160
It... It doesn't look like a date.

525
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,960
- Uh, do you mind?
- Not at all.

526
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,360
- Anyway, I'll be home early.
- I knew it!

527
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,960
I gotta go. Bye.

528
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,760
Would you mind
if I take care of this transaction

529
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,560
without you peering
over my shoulder like that?

530
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,040
Thank you.

531
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,760
I moved away 'cause Stanley
doesn't want me to see his secret code.

532
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:59,000
Hey, Phil, she doesn't care.
Just stand there and be quiet.

533
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,920
Will do.

534
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,840
All right. $200.
Really sorry for the inconvenience,

535
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,920
and take care. Really appreciate it.
Thank you.

536
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,960
OK.

537
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,280
Bye-bye.

538
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,680
Have a good one.

539
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,880
Do you mind if we, like, quickly take
him down to the hospital? Is that OK?

540
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,800
No.
Yeah, I'm sure that's...

541
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,920
- I mean, I think you should.
- OK.

542
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,800
Uh, Phil.

543
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,000
There goes the first act.

544
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,520
- That's for sure.
- Huh?

545
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,760
You can say that again.

546
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,800
What are you talking about?

547
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:21,120
I thought it was a saying.
"There goes the first act."

548
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,880
- Have you ever heard it before?
- No.

549
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,840
- Then how can it be a saying?
- I don't know.

550
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,520
I thought you were starting it.

551
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,520
Are you listening to me?
I'm halfway through the first act

552
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:32,720
- They're not even in their seats yet.
- OK.

553
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,520
Guys, Michael's at the theater.
He says they're nowhere to be found.

554
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:39,160
Ted. Ted. Don't make
an announcement. What are you doing?

555
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,760
- I'm just...
- You know what, you're a moron.

556
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,640
You're off the board.
I'm shit-canning you off the board.

557
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,160
You don't touch the eraser
for the rest of the night.

558
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,520
You give it to Sally. Now!

559
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,280
- I'm off the board.
- Oh.

560
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:00,080
Um...
I'm off the board.

561
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,800
That's embarrassing.

562
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,760
- Is that for me?
- Just take it.

563
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,200
Is that for me?
Thanks, sweetie.

564
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,560
Have a seat.
OK, where were we?

565
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,000
All right.
I need someone to back up Neal's 15.

566
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,000
- I'm in.
- 15 on groping.

567
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,040
All right, attagirl, attagirl.

568
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,160
- She's nice.
- Yeah, I know.

569
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,400
That's why I was trying to
spend the evening with her.

570
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,800
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

571
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,720
Phil...

572
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,440
You see that woman in there?
From the moment I saw her,

573
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,760
all I could think about was her,
so I planned the perfect evening,

574
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:43,160
knowing full well that if I ever got the
chance, I'd only have one shot at it.

575
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:48,000
So where am I spending my perfect
evening with her? I'm with you.

576
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,360
- Which woman? The one in the hat?
- Diana!

577
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,400
- Oh.
- The one in the hat?

578
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,440
Diana.

579
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,240
Phil...

580
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:10,160
Have you ever felt like you were
just really meant to be with somebody?

581
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,340
Like your whole life
was just kind of this

582
00:35:12,341 --> 00:35:14,480
big mess that just
kinda kept happening

583
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:19,640
up until the day when this unbelievable
person came into your life,

584
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,080
and then suddenly, you know,
you didn't feel so lost anymore.

585
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:29,160
You felt like everything you thought
you'd been doing wrong in your life,

586
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,200
you're actually doing it right,

587
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,160
because that whole time
she was coming closer to you.

588
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,200
You just weren't smart enough
to know it.

589
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,000
Or... brave enough to just tell her.

590
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,080
I... I had that once.

591
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,480
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

592
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:55,120
That's good. You see? I mean,
so you know what I'm talking about.

593
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,880
I loved her...
I loved her more than anything.

594
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,120
- What was her name?
- Laura.

595
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,480
She gave me first glass animal.

596
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,280
And I left and... never saw her again.

597
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,000
Well, Phil...

598
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,360
when that happened to you,

599
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,760
it really upset you, right,
inside, to lose this Laura?

600
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,760
Well, that's how I feel about Diana.
You see?

601
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,680
And if one more thing
goes wrong with this evening, Phil,

602
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,760
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

603
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,400
The way you feel about Laura, you see,

604
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:40,080
that's the way I feel about Diana.

605
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,920
It's the same thing.

606
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,880
- Got it.
- Great. Thanks, man. Thank you.

607
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,720
I'm gonna help.

608
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,480
I don't need it.

609
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,480
Phil, I don't need it, OK?

610
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,720
I hope you're smiling
'cause you get it. I do.

611
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,920
All right, Phil.
They're gonna take some x-rays

612
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,360
just to make sure everything's OK.

613
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,440
They said it could take
about 20 minutes.

614
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,520
And then Stanley and I,
we're gonna go see our play.

615
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,000
- X-ray? Why?
- You'll be fine.

616
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,040
It'll be OK.
It'll be quick.

617
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,840
Phil, it's gonna be...

618
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,160
- Come on now!
- It's gonna be OK.

619
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,800
Phil, I don't need your help, OK?
Now just relax and take it...

620
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,360
You need to bust a move.

621
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,520
The rap number. "Chick walks up,
you wish you could sex her.

622
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,300
You're standing on the wall
like you was Poindexter.

623
00:37:40,301 --> 00:37:42,000
Break it down for me, fellas."

624
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,720
- I remember it. Thanks.
- No, but you're the Poindexter.

625
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,560
Nobody's breaking anything down, OK?
Just take it easy.

626
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,480
You're the Poindexter.
And I'm gonna help...

627
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,120
Can We go ahead
and do this. Please?

628
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,560
I'm gonna help you bust your move.

629
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,520
You're not alone here, Phil.
We're both watching.

630
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,560
I don't think
you really know what you want.

631
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:05,080
Yeah, I do, Phil.
So, please, I wanna be alone with her.

632
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,760
Well... I'm helping,
and I'm not changing my mind.

633
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,800
- Everything looks fine.
- Nothing's broken?

634
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,920
- No.
- Thank God.

635
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,960
Great. Now Doc,
I need to ask you

636
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,800
- a really big favor here.
- What's going on?

637
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,600
When you give him back his test results,

638
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,960
if you could just give him that,
I'd really appreciate it.

639
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:29,080
- What are you guys talking about?
- I know it seems really weird,

640
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,640
but trust me, when you talk to him,
when you talk to him,

641
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,920
you'll see what I'm...
you're gonna get what I'm talking about.

642
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,640
Just tell him he can take a cab
anywhere he wants to go.

643
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,720
Here's my home phone number.
He can call me tomorrow.

644
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:45,680
Hey, Phil. I'm gonna go check on Diana.
I'll be right back.

645
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,040
OK.

646
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,720
- How'd it go?
- Great, great. Are you ready?

647
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,280
- Yeah. Is Phil coming?
- Uh, he didn't wanna come.

648
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:01,160
He said to say thank you but he'd
rather be alone right now. Go figure.

649
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,560
But yeah, he's gonna
wait for the results

650
00:39:03,561 --> 00:39:05,840
with the nurse. They kinda hit it off.

651
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,280
- Oh. Good for him.
- Yeah.

652
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,400
If we're lucky, we may be able to
catch the end of the first act.

653
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,400
Good.

654
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,480
Thank God that's over.

655
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,920
OK.
Where were we?

656
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,440
Time for America.

657
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,840
- Man down.
- Stanley!

658
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,560
You promised.

659
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,600
You know, you really are so amazing
with what you've been through tonight.

660
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,560
- You sure you're OK?
- Now I am.

661
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,160
We really should have taken you
back to the hospital.

662
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,640
No!

663
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,840
No, God.
That horrible, horrible machine.

664
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:07,480
- So what happened with the nurse?
- What?

665
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,400
Well, Stanley said that
you and she were hitting it off

666
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,720
and that's why you stayed back there.

667
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,000
She had a fat ass.

668
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,320
Sorry, Phil.

669
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,840
Yeah, I just don't wanna miss it.

670
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,800
Come on. Let's go.

671
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:38,440
It's just down here.
We'll go to will call and pick 'em up.

672
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,440
America.

673
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:48,800
Phil, we gotta run, but I can't tell you
what a pleasure it's been, so...

674
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,280
- Bye.
- But I... I have to... help.

675
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,880
It's OK. You know?
I think we got it.

676
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,960
- Really?
- Yeah.

677
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,640
- OK.
- We'll see you later.

678
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,480
- Take care.
- Great meeting you.

679
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,120
Have a good one.

680
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,360
Ladies and gentlemen.
Just a reminder.

681
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:12,120
Theater in the Park is reliant on
your non-tax-deductible contributions...

682
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,400
- Here?
- Yeah.

683
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,400
- Excuse me.
- Act two Will begin in one minute.

684
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,400
Sorry.

685
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,200
- What happened to you?
- What are you doing here?

686
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,160
I got tickets.

687
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,840
- For who?
- Me and Marilyn.

688
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,440
Hi, Stanley.
You're a mad dog.

689
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,680
- Diana.
- Michael.

690
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,160
- Really nice to see you.
- Nice to see you too.

691
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,240
- You're looking good.
- Thank you.

692
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,680
- Big fan of the play.
- Really?

693
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:44,520
I come every night. Every night.
I can't get enough of it.

694
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,880
- How's it going?
- Good. Good.

695
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,960
Good.

696
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,840
You'll be fine. You're a mad dog.
Mad dog. Go, mad dog, go.

697
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,120
Woof, woof.

698
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,720
This guy...

699
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,200
You know, I'm really
kind of worried about Phil.

700
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:05,600
Oh, I'm sure he'll be fine. Yeah.
Did he put something in there?

701
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,960
No, I think you have
enough stuff in there.

702
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,080
He seemed really sad
when we dropped him off, didn't he?

703
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,760
Yeah, yeah, but...

704
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,520
No. He actually seemed fine.
He seemed kinda preoccupied with,

705
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,600
you know, just kind of
getting back to his life.

706
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:23,360
- Yeah...
- Yeah.

707
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,040
The Union Pacific Railway system.

708
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,200
When I was a little boy,

709
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:36,360
I used to stay up at night
just so I could hear the train go by.

710
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,160
You see, my father -
yes, my father - was the...

711
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:44,280
He would always give me
an extra... extra whistle...

712
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,680
I wonder what took longer:
His monologue,

713
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:58,560
or to actually build the rail roads.

714
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,360
This is some dogshit, dude.
Just dogshit.

715
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,600
You know, it's actually
so bad, it's good.

716
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:16,080
- Oh, yeah. It's almost fascinating.
- Don't you think?

717
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,720
I think we might need
a little more hairspray.

718
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,920
Should be up higher, should be poofy.

719
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,880
'72 he wore it real poofy.

720
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,920
My mother's mother.

721
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:01,440
That would make her my granny.
We'd gather right here in this very room

722
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,480
every Sunday afternoon after services.

723
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,160
All the men sat out on the porch

724
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:12,560
blowing smoke from their pipes
into some God-awful configurations!

725
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:17,320
And my mother, she never mentioned
what happened again.

726
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,760
She's still talking?

727
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,320
I think she's kind of
working her way towards the finale.

728
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:29,760
Knit one, purl two.
Knit one, purl two.

729
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,440
Knit one, purl two...

730
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,160
I... I can't see a thing.

731
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,640
I mean...

732
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:50,080
- OK, that's worse.
- Who's this guy?

733
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,320
What the f...?
Who is this guy?

734
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,400
Do something.

735
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,600
- Do something!
- Who is this guy? Come on. Come on.

736
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,760
What is he doing?

737
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:10,920
I...

738
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,440
I found this bread over... over there.

739
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,120
So I... I took it.

740
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:25,640
I like bread.
It tastes good.

741
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:30,640
It's good for you.
It's filling.

742
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,600
You can eat it hot or cold, which is...

743
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,000
That's good.

744
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:41,760
And there's a million different kinds.

745
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,760
Hang on.

746
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:46,440
- Roll the slides.
- No. Those are my slides.

747
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,760
There's rye...

748
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,440
wheat, whole-wheat...

749
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,600
pumpernickel, sourdough...

750
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,720
You know sourdough bread?

751
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:08,440
Egg, garlic, raisin, nut, pita...

752
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,960
white, wheat, whole-grain

753
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:18,760
or multigrain or even... a bun.

754
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,000
But the truth is...

755
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,840
it's all the same thing.

756
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:33,280
They all started out exactly the...
the same way.

757
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:38,440
But because we needed it
and... and we shaped it,

758
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:41,920
it... it turned out to be...

759
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:49,280
exactly what we...
what we wanted it to be.

760
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,720
I don't know.

761
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,320
Food for thought.

762
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,320
We hear you!

763
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,960
Curtain call.
Yeah, curtain call now. Go.

764
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:25,640
Smile. Smile, Custer, smile.
Come on, curtain call.

765
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:36,280
You're a genius, man.
You're a genius!

766
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,360
That was so great, Phil.

767
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,240
You're parked in a tow away zone.

768
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,920
I don't believe this!

769
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,560
Come on.
I mean, it was right here.

770
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,880
I know.

771
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,920
And... they took my bag.

772
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,760
Best thing in the show.

773
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,880
They took my bag.

774
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,040
No, Phil. They took my car.
My car.

775
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:18,880
Your bag of broken glass just happened
to be in it because you left it there.

776
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:24,080
I'm really sorry, and if you wanna call
it a night, you know, I'll understand.

777
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,320
No. We'll find your car.
It's no big deal.

778
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,000
- Here.
- Thank you.

779
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:33,120
- You're welcome.
- She's a keeper.

780
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,600
Hello?

781
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:38,480
- Ted, don't answer my phone.
- I thought we made up.

782
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,500
What is it?

783
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:42,400
I told you, Ted.
Shouldn't have done it.

784
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,720
Hey, sweetie.
How you doing?

785
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,880
What's up! Biatch!

786
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,040
You gotta update the board.
I think we're looking strong.

787
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,000
Who's supposed to be
covering the restaurant?

788
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:51,880
Mark.

789
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,320
Right, well tell Mark to get his ass
over there. He should be there.

790
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,120
OK. Mark, I need you to
go to the restaurant right now.

791
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,120
Right. Mark's going.
Schnell! Schnell!

792
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,160
Hey, I got pies!

793
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,160
All right. Bye.

794
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,920
- Thank you. Come on.
- OK.

795
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:13,120
Due, I thought you were on the board.
No? OK. In the fridge.

796
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:18,400
I haven't been on a bus in years.

797
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,280
Hi. Would you mind
if I write you a check?

798
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,040
- You can owe me.
- Thank you.

799
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:30,240
- Who's on the bus?
- OK, what are you doing?

800
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:33,320
- All right? Please don't make a scene.
- I'm doing the bus song. Bus song.

801
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,360
- What's the bus song?
- Bus song.

802
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:40,120
OK, You're making me uncomfortable,
all right? Can we sit down, please?

803
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,440
Yeah. That's fine.

804
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:46,720
Who's on the bus?
Who's on the bus? Who's on the bus?

805
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,520
"OK, Stanley. I'll sit down.
I don't have to sing the song."

806
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:52,480
- Thanks, Phil. I really appreciate it.
- Who's on the bus?

807
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,200
- Hey, sit down!
- Who's on the bus? Who's on the bus?

808
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,400
Who's on the bus?

809
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,520
- Mary.
- Who's on the bus?

810
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,640
Mary's on the bus and she's going to...

811
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:07,720
- Alvarado Street.
- Alvarado Street.

812
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:12,000
Who's on the bus?
Who's on the bus? Who's on the bus?

813
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,520
- Bill?
- Who's on the bus?

814
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,440
Bill's on the bus and he's going to...

815
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,880
- Spring Street.
- Yeah!

816
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,200
Who's on the bus?
Who's on the bus?

817
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,080
- Stanley.
- Who's on the bus?

818
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:30,000
Stanley's on the bus
and he's going to...

819
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:33,120
- Dinner.
- Dinner. Mm!

820
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,320
Who's on the bus?
Everybody!

821
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:40,080
Who's on the bus?
Who's on the bus? Who's on the bus?

822
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,080
Mahareinlu.

823
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:49,240
Who's on the bus? Mahareinlu's
on the bus and she's going to...

824
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,200
Cerritos, California.

825
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,200
Mahareinlu's on the wrong bus!

826
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:58,080
Mahareinlu's on the bus.

827
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,560
Oh, boy.
"Who's on the bus?"

828
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,040
- That was a lovely song.
- What are you doing?

829
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:08,440
Making shadows.
Laura and I used to do this.

830
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,400
Laura? Hm.

831
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,640
Is that a girlfriend?

832
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,680
Yeah, sort of.

833
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:18,560
- See how big I can make myself?
- Yeah, Phil, you're huge.

834
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,000
So huge.
But look at how big we are.

835
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:40,320
- You don't have to carry me anymore.
- Are you kidding? I'm in the zone.

836
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,800
I mean, my heart rate's up,
we just won a major battle back there,

837
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:46,000
and, I mean, you got on
open-toed shoes, so...

838
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:49,160
I got you. Well, I mean,
I figured I'd carry you to the street.

839
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:51,280
That way your feet
didn't get dirty back here.

840
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:54,440
- You didn't want my feet to get dirty?
- I mean, I could go either way.

841
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,880
It's just, you know,
I figured you like 'em clean,

842
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,560
you know, otherwise you wouldn't have
done such a good job washing them.

843
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:04,080
- There you go, my lady.
- Well, thank you, good sir.

844
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,680
Sir Stanley at your service.

845
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:12,240
Come here.

846
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:17,560
You got your clothes
a little messed up carrying me there.

847
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,640
- Oh, thanks.
- You're welcome.

848
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,600
Thank you.

849
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,280
You guys are having a moment.

850
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,240
Kinda.

851
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,880
I've never really had a moment.

852
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:38,800
- I'm gonna go get the car.
- I'll go too.

853
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,120
I was...

854
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,040
I mean, I'm at the restaurant,

855
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,320
and Stanley and Diana
are nowhere to be found.

856
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,600
They're holding the table for 'em.

857
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,720
Yeah, he gave them 100 bucks.
The maitre d' told me.

858
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,440
All right, look,
just stay at the restaurant.

859
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,880
I'm sure they'll be there any second.
And call Sally

860
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,080
and tell her that
We're on our Way to the capper table.

861
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,680
- How you doing in there?
- Good.

862
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,480
OK.

863
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:08,000
It's over.
I got a bad feeling, OK?

864
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:11,280
- Maybe there's a change of plan.
- True that. True that.

865
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:18,880
You towed my car here
and now it's somewhere on your lot.

866
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,480
Well, you're gonna have to
talk to Hank about that.

867
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,600
And he's on a break.

868
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:25,600
Yeah.

869
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:31,240
I like your flowers.

870
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:35,280
Listen here. We got those
out of one of the vehicles.

871
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:39,120
- I know. You got 'em out of mine.
- No.

872
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,200
Yeah. Hey, listen, I don't care
about the flowers, all right?

873
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,880
I'd just like to get the car back.

874
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,800
- Hi.
- Hi.

875
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,040
- Is everything all right?
- Well, yeah.

876
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:58,800
But this gentleman won't release the car
until Hank gets back.

877
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:01,200
- He's on a break.
- And he's on a break.

878
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,480
Uh, yeah...

879
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,160
- Hi.
- Hi.

880
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:16,440
You know, I'm trying to ditch
Fred and Barney over here.

881
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:17,440
Yeah.

882
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:23,080
So the sooner I get my car,
the sooner we can party.

883
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:26,520
Oh. Me likey.

884
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:30,120
Break my heart.

885
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,120
- Let me see what I can do.
- Thank you.

886
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:35,120
- Hey, Hank.
- I'm taking my break.

887
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:40,440
Yeah, well, you're gonna wanna see this.
We got a little party treat.

888
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:45,880
What's so damn important
that it can't wait till after my...

889
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:54,120
What can I do you for?

890
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,640
Listen, I was telling
your buddy here that...

891
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:02,000
I'm trying to lose some excess baggage.

892
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,680
I think I got the claim check on.

893
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,800
I'm handling this.

894
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:15,080
- Go on.
- Yeah. It's the '97 green Taurus.

895
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:20,280
Yeah. That one came in
a little over an hour ago.

896
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,440
It came in about an hour ago.

897
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,000
Ow!

898
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:30,400
You stay there.
And don't move.

899
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:34,080
Let me show you to your vehicle.

900
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:35,240
Thanks.

901
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:38,320
- Carl will ring you up.
- OK.

902
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:43,000
Hey, hammerhead, get off your fat ass
and ring this guy up.

903
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,680
Thanks.

904
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,880
- You OK?
- Yeah.

905
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,360
- All right, let's see here.
- Right this way, darling.

906
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,760
- $179.50.
- What?

907
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,080
$179.50.

908
00:55:56,160 --> 00:56:01,160
It's $55 for parking in a commercial
loading zone, which you did.

909
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:06,520
$80 for the tow.
$44.50 for the overnight storage.

910
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,080
- It's only been here an hour.
- You know what?

911
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:13,440
- We're gonna need some cash.
- I don't have the cash.

912
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,360
Here you go.

913
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,320
You can owe me.

914
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,360
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

915
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:28,720
A friend in need.

916
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,080
No, no, we're not gonna
take care of it later, OK?

917
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,000
We're gonna take care of it right now.

918
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:37,040
We're gonna go to that ATM,
we're gonna get your money,

919
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:42,640
and though we've had some wonderful
moments, we're gonna call it a night.

920
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:46,240
- Call it a night?
- Yeah. Good night.

921
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,320
But we're... we're having so much fun.

922
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,200
No, Phil. You're having fun, all right?

923
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,960
But she... she's laughing.

924
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:59,760
Yes, Phil, but she's laughing at you,
all right, not with me.

925
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:03,800
And right now there's a dinner
and a bottle of champagne

926
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:06,680
standing between me
and the rest of my life.

927
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,400
So I'm just asking you, you know...

928
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:14,080
let me have my date back, OK?

929
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:17,320
I still think I'm helping. I do.

930
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,360
Oh, you're not. You're not.

931
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:26,880
So...

932
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,600
- Don't touch me.
- You got it.

933
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:38,640
- Your loss, sweet cheeks.
- I'm sure it is.

934
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,520
Thanks, Hank.

935
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:46,600
- I'm sitting in the middle this time.
- All right.

936
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,320
He would have to sit in back.

937
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:57,840
Hey, Phil. So how are
my two favorite men?

938
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:59,880
- Good.
- Wasn't that fun?

939
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,440
Yep.

940
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:11,560
Car sick.
I think I'm gonna be car sick.

941
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:14,400
- Phil, don't, OK?
- Are you all right?

942
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,680
I'm good.

943
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:30,520
Yeah, I feel better.
False alarm, I guess.

944
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:35,800
See, she's laughing.
And you said I wasn't helping.

945
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:39,040
Helping? Helping with what?

946
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,720
Phil...

947
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:45,680
- What's he talking about?
- What's he talking about?

948
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,040
He's talking about helping.
Helping you, Diana.

949
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,680
You need to loosen up a little bit.

950
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,280
- I need to loosen up?
- You really do.

951
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,880
We got to talking earlier,
and you're wound pretty tight, you know?

952
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,840
You couldn't possibly be talking
about someone else in this car?

953
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,560
Who happens to be
sitting behind the wheel?

954
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:05,680
Who, me? No. I'm like water.
I'm flowing.

955
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:09,720
I'm like a reed out there,
just blowing peacefully in the breeze.

956
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:13,080
Do I look tense? I got the blinker
on, I got the blinker off.

957
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:16,960
I got the wiper on. It ain't raining.
We're cruising along peacefully.

958
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:19,800
- With the hazards on.
- Oh, yeah?

959
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:21,520
Wanna see me do something crazy?

960
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:25,120
I'll pull over right now
and drink some expired milk.

961
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:29,760
I'm just nuts, just shape-shifting,
all kinds of stuff.

962
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,800
What?

963
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:46,240
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

964
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:54,360
It's not gonna get any greener.

965
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:58,480
I know, Phil. I know.

966
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,560
Thanks.

967
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,440
- Thanks.
- What are you gonna do?

968
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:26,280
I think I'm gonna go buy glue,
get some newspaper, lay that out,

969
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:29,360
put on some soup, take a nap.

970
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:33,120
Then I'm gonna do a little triage
on these babies here.

971
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:38,840
Bad news, Phil. ATM's out of cash.
I'm really sorry,

972
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:41,400
but I'm afraid you're gonna have to
come with us while we grab a bite,

973
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:45,120
and then we'll go
get your money afterwards, OK?

974
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,880
Whatever.

975
01:00:46,881 --> 01:00:48,560
I'm really sorry to
put you out like this.

976
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,880
I know a great place.

977
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,800
Sounds good.

978
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,560
So... how do we get to this great place?

979
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:04,920
- Hey, guys. Guys.
- What are you doing?

980
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:08,080
- I've made my own board.
- Ted, don't be ridiculous.

981
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,720
Guys, 12 to 1 odds that they
make it to the capper table.

982
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:13,040
- Put me down for 20.
- All right.

983
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:15,440
- The date's already over.
- You don't know that.

984
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:16,960
He's dying.

985
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:20,440
Pathetic.
Let's go to the big board, folks.

986
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:23,600
- It's yellowtail.
- That's a fish.

987
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:27,280
What? Why's the rice so clumpy?

988
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:30,480
Phil, would you just shut up
and just eat it?

989
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,180
Here, take a little of
this and put it with

990
01:01:32,181 --> 01:01:33,800
that and then you gotta
dunk it in there.

991
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:37,200
Then you just eat it.
It's good.

992
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:39,840
Yeah. It's good.

993
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:44,000
So how long have you
worked at Smith Bates?

994
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:46,800
- About four years.
- You're kidding!

995
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,400
No. Why?

996
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,840
Wow. I just didn't think
you were there that long.

997
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:54,480
Well, I've been over at the Van Nuys
office for a couple of years,

998
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,600
so probably haven't seen
a lot of each other.

999
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:58,280
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1000
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:04,360
- There is no Van Nuys office.
- You're kidding! Yeah, I noticed

1001
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:08,600
that I was one of the only people around
the office most of the time.

1002
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:16,440
We've ridden the elevator together.
Quite a few times.

1003
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,760
Yeah.

1004
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:23,000
- Do you remember?
- I think I do recall.

1005
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:25,000
I'm usually so focused at work,

1006
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:28,800
but I do think, yeah,
I have ridden the elevator with you.

1007
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:30,600
Yeah. Yeah, I have.

1008
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,840
- Spicy.
- Yeah, spicy.

1009
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,840
You like that, huh?

1010
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:46,040
Here, Phil, kind of go like that.

1011
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:47,920
You just got a little... right here.

1012
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:50,320
Some of the spicy stuff,
you got it right here in your teeth.

1013
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,320
- Where?
- Right there.

1014
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,280
I can't... I can't get a fix on it.

1015
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:58,640
- I'd go to the bathroom, Phil.
- It's still there.

1016
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,320
He's quite a character.

1017
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:11,480
Really? I thought you didn't like him.

1018
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,800
He actually kinda grows on you,
you know?

1019
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,120
He does, doesn't he?

1020
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:19,880
Yes, you are moist,

1021
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:24,520
but the moisture is from the beverage
I have just spilled on you.

1022
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:26,480
No, no, shocking at first,

1023
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:30,760
but I know that you will become
used to it, if not even prefer it.

1024
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,640
Merci.

1025
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:35,360
What a great French accent.

1026
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:38,560
Spent a little time in England, so...

1027
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,840
Come here.

1028
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,560
Got it.

1029
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,960
- You had a piece of lint in your hair.
- Oh, God. Thank you.

1030
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:50,520
Yeah. Is that it?
Is everything out of there?

1031
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:53,880
I don't know.
There might be some more.

1032
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,800
Isn't this perfect?

1033
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,600
Oh, God. It's Kevin.

1034
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,840
- Who's Kevin?
- My ex-boyfriend.

1035
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,600
- How are you?
- Wow.

1036
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,600
Wow.

1037
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:15,560
You don't waste any time, do you?

1038
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:20,720
- Should I get the check?
- No.

1039
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:23,360
- Don't do this.
- Do what?

1040
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,840
- This.
- Is this a friend from work?

1041
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:28,080
Probably consoling you

1042
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:31,560
because you're so torn up
about breaking my heart.

1043
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:35,160
Kevin, I am sorry,
but this is not the place for this.

1044
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:39,520
- We both knew this wasn't working out.
- Yeah. I guess.

1045
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:47,680
That's just perfect for you,
though, isn't it?

1046
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:51,120
God, you love the bullshit, don't you?
You love the bullshit.

1047
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:55,400
The struggle to connect, try to change
a guy. You know we'll never change.

1048
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:59,520
And then it's his fault, that he didn't
measure up. Right? You blame him.

1049
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:02,520
So then you dump him and then nobody
ever really has to get close to you,

1050
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,520
and everybody keeps thinking
you're perfect.

1051
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:07,320
- Well, I'm far from perfect.
- No shit.

1052
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,680
And you're a shining example of that.

1053
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:16,840
Wow. Man.

1054
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:21,120
I mean... what, has he got
Laker tickets or something?

1055
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:24,200
What is it? I mean...

1056
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:27,640
You got a lot of money or something?
You got a sports car? Big house? What?

1057
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,240
- Is that what you think I'm about?
- Shut up.

1058
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:33,160
- You shut up.
- What?

1059
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:38,520
What'd you say?

1060
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,480
That's my seat.

1061
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:47,080
Phil, not right now.

1062
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:51,760
Oh, no.
Is he with you?

1063
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:54,000
Mm-hm. Don't.

1064
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,640
Oh, man.

1065
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,200
Hey, how's it going?

1066
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:01,560
Kevin, stop.

1067
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:04,520
No, no, it's all right. Rain Man
wants to know what's going on.

1068
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:07,840
I'll just fill the Rain Man in.

1069
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:12,360
See, this creature just broke up
with me, like, three days ago.

1070
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:17,360
And now she's out there with her
hands in your buddy's pants, so...

1071
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,720
I was thinking of taking him outside
and whipping his ass.

1072
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,880
Just kind of as a thing,
you know, I mean...

1073
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,800
Do you have a problem with that?
I mean, maybe you can come with me...

1074
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:31,080
Stop it.
You're embarrassing yourself.

1075
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:34,160
Have a little dignity.

1076
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,400
All right, shh.

1077
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:56,040
I'm so sorry.

1078
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:20,520
I'm so sorry
about what happened back there.

1079
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:22,400
Don't worry about it.

1080
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:25,400
- But I am.
- Apology accepted.

1081
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:30,120
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, sure. I'm fine.

1082
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:45,320
- You were laughing.
- Yeah. I was having fun.

1083
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:50,560
It was lovely to meet you, Phil.

1084
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,560
Back at you.

1085
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:57,560
- He's a good egg.
- Yeah, he is.

1086
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,840
He's definitely a good egg.

1087
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:04,240
I just wish his shell
were a little harder.

1088
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,920
- Well, good night, Phil.
- Later.

1089
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:13,120
Are you sure
you're gonna be OK around here?

1090
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,840
Yeah. Now that I got my money,

1091
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:18,320
tomorrow I can start
collecting my menagerie again.

1092
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:26,320
Wait a second.

1093
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:29,480
- Your what?
- What?

1094
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:33,680
Just now, in the car, you said
"Tomorrow I can start collecting my..."

1095
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:36,760
- Animal menagerie.
- Glass animal menagerie?

1096
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:42,680
Phil, this woman,
the one that you're in love with,

1097
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:45,440
with the dancing
and the shadows on the wall, Laura,

1098
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:48,600
was her last name Wingfield,
by any chance?

1099
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:50,960
Her brother Tom introduced you two,
maybe?

1100
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,280
- Yup, that's the one.
- What do you mean,

1101
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:55,960
"Yup, that's the one"?
I mean, did it happen or not, Phil?

1102
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:58,880
- Yup, that's...
- From a book, you idiot.

1103
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:03,240
Right? The play, The Glass Menagerie.
By Tennessee Williams.

1104
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,880
Her brother Tom,
did he introduce you two?

1105
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:18,560
What's in the bag?
Let me see the bag.

1106
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:20,120
- No.
- What do you mean no?

1107
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:21,960
- Let me see the damn bag.
- I don't want to.

1108
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,880
- I don't care what you want.
- It's my bag! It's my bag!

1109
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:28,600
Stop it. Does it really matter
what's in his bag?

1110
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:32,720
- He ruins our entire night...
- Stanley, he didn't ruin our evening.

1111
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:34,680
This is ruining our evening.

1112
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:40,960
Will you please take us back
to my apartment?

1113
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:45,760
- Now he's sleeping over?
- No, he's not sleeping over.

1114
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:49,200
But we can't leave him out here.
He doesn't have a place to go.

1115
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:52,240
I'm gonna find the guy a place to sleep.

1116
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:56,240
This is perfect.

1117
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:10,160
Good night.

1118
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,520
Come on, Phil.

1119
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:23,760
Nice try, champ.

1120
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:42,160
I'll be right down, Phil. I'm just gonna
make a couple of calls for you.

1121
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:03,960
"Nice try, champ"?

1122
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:16,080
Yeah, I'll hold.

1123
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:27,800
Oh.

1124
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:30,840
I didn't even hear you come in.
You scared me.

1125
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:34,240
I'm just on hold. I'm trying to
find you a place for tonight.

1126
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,480
It should just be a minute.

1127
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:46,880
- Diana...
- Hang on one second. Yeah?

1128
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:49,800
- I like you.
- I like you too, Phil.

1129
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:53,160
No. No.

1130
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:58,480
I mean... I like you.

1131
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:02,120
Just relax.

1132
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:05,000
Stanley!

1133
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,640
Stanley, be careful!

1134
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:11,440
Took you long enough. Hi. How are you?
You're breathing on me.

1135
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:14,080
Pick me up.
Throw me into the doorjamb.

1136
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:16,000
OK.

1137
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:23,400
- Careful!
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1138
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:27,600
Don't ever put your hands
on a woman like that again!

1139
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:31,680
- What are you, an idiot?
- Sorry about that.

1140
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:37,960
I'm gonna beat you
like a rented mule, man.

1141
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:39,240
Let him go!

1142
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:42,520
Hold on, 'cause I'm not even
done with you yet!

1143
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:56,640
And stay out!

1144
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:14,080
How sweet are you.

1145
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:16,760
Not that sweet.

1146
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:23,600
I called Michael when we were having
drinks and asked him to put that there.

1147
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:25,800
This was supposed to be
the perfect evening

1148
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:28,680
and not one thing's gone
the way it was supposed to.

1149
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:33,920
Look at you.

1150
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:38,240
I don't like caviar.

1151
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:40,680
OK...

1152
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:42,720
I don't have great abs.

1153
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,800
I mean, they're not bad.
They're just not that good.

1154
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:49,680
I haven't traveled much.
I can't watch a lot of foreign movies

1155
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:51,640
'cause I spend so much time
with the words,

1156
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:56,120
I can't tell what the people
are doing on the screen.

1157
01:13:56,240 --> 01:14:00,040
I'm not a very good cook.
I'm an all-right dancer.

1158
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:05,000
I'm also pretty sure I'm
going bald... fast.

1159
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:08,560
And... well...

1160
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:11,520
Phil...

1161
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:15,160
He... He wasn't trying to hurt you.

1162
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:19,160
He was just trying to get me
to stand up for something.

1163
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:21,520
And you...

1164
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:23,480
you really move me.

1165
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:27,000
I watch how you are with people,

1166
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:29,760
and how you can change someone's day
with your smile,

1167
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:36,400
and how you seem oblivious to the
admiration of the people around you.

1168
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:40,760
And you're bright and beautiful
and warm and charming and funny.

1169
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:44,760
And your laugh... it makes me laugh.

1170
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:48,200
And...

1171
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:55,520
I just wanted to tell you these things,
even if you go back to calling me Steve.

1172
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:58,960
- I like foreign films.
- I figured.

1173
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:04,560
And... other than that, I don't
have any problems with your list.

1174
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:09,800
And you know what?
I figured out our friend's little plan

1175
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:13,000
after you threw him against my wall
and broke my vase.

1176
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:17,360
You'll be reimbursed for that.

1177
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:22,200
No one can plan a perfect evening.

1178
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:28,520
Even a wonderful guy who writes
how to ask a girl out on an index card.

1179
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:35,920
Come here.
I have to tell you something else.

1180
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:46,920
We did good, girl.
We did good.

1181
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:58,240
I had a wonderful time.

1182
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,720
- Really?
- Yeah.

1183
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:03,840
- The eagle has landed.
- We have contact!

1184
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,680
Can I kiss you again?

1185
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:15,360
Mm-hm.

1186
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:24,640
Let me see. Let me see.

1187
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:26,880
Oh, look at 'em. Look at 'em.

1188
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:28,800
- Oh, God, look at 'em.
- Look at you.

1189
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:30,760
Look at me.

1190
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:36,720
I always wanted to
get my swerve on on my bike.

1191
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,720
Oh!

1192
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:49,840
- This hasn't gone so bad.
- Not at all.

1193
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:15,520
- You're embarrassing yourself.
- I'm trying to parlay, you jackass.

1194
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:18,360
I thought the point of a parlay was
you're supposed to win some money first.

1195
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:20,600
Good luck.

1196
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:22,480
Asshole.

1197
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:32,840
- How you doing?
- All right. Will that be all?

1198
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:34,960
Can I get a bag?

1199
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:36,960
- I'm driving.
- Shotgun.

1200
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:51,040
- For work.
- What do you do?

1201
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:53,040
What don't I do?

1202
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:58,080
- What are you doing tonight?
- Tonight?

1203
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:01,360
I took the night off.

1204
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:04,880
You have a good one.

1205
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:32,560
Hey, eyes on the road,
not the scratches.

1206
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:35,880
- Don't tell me how..
- Eyes on the road, not...

1207
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,360
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

1208
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:43,320
Man down, man down.
