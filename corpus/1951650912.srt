Besides, a commando-style
rescue mission in Miami...

315
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:30,736

a great deal of money to organize.

I understand your anger.

- Yes, sir, I've looked into your request.

But I must say,
it's beyond my capabilities.

in Leavenworth, Kansas.

348
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,425
A lovely facility, I'm told.

349
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,437
Guarded by the largest infantry division
of the US Army.

350
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,029
A well-known fact.

351
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:44,370
But until then...

352
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:49,571
the South Africans are detaining Kamal at
the Randveld Prison outside of Cape Town.

353
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,782
I'm told it's a lovely facility, too.

354
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:58,778
To snatch your son from Randveld...

355
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:03,124
the most heavily fortified prison
in the southern hemisphere.

356
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:09,823
- Yet, it is not quite Leavenworth.
- Almost. Trust me, it can't be done.

357
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:14,195
I have controlled the arms pipeline
through the Middle East for 20 years.

358
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,839
Money? I am a billionaire
many times over.

359
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:23,542
And I would spend every bit of it
to free my first-born child.

360
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:28,548
But in order for an operation of this type
to be completely successful...

361
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:33,420
I should anticipate a certain risk
and a certain expense.

362
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:36,620
That is just your payment, Mr. Chapel.

363
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:40,692
A quarter down, the rest
when my son is standing before me.

364
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:43,767
Now, tell me again
how some things just can't be done?

365
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:46,903
I do stand corrected, sir.

366
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:51,532
You will find $20 million
in an account in the Cayman Islands.

367
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:55,236
When that amount has been depleted,
it will be automatically refilled.

368
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,772
And how many times may I deplete it, sir?

369
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:02,718
You will know when you've reached
the limits of my indulgence.

370
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:04,913
How?

371
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:09,284
There will be a bullet
in your head, Mr. Chapel.

372
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:16,158
Everything you need to know
about Randveld is in these files.

373
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:19,296
You decide.

374
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:21,261
Here you go.

375
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:25,541
I'm not interested.

376
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:32,079

of what that concept means, John.

00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:01,178
You know what?

384
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:05,180
I'm kind of fascinated that you just
don't have any means of persuasion.

385
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:06,716
Are you referring to a gun?

386
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:07,773
SEEGER: Mmm.

387
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:09,849
I don't touch a gun.

388
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:12,651
And guns don't touch me.
That's why I'm still alive.

389
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:14,851
I think it'd be good if you let them go.

390
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:20,153
I think it would be nice if you understood
that I'm a pushover, but I am not an idiot.

391
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:25,168
And you promised Radio Jones
that you would take care of little Eddie.

392
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:28,728
And little Eddie is being taken care of,
as you can see, quite well.

393
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:32,640
You kind of got me over a barrel.
How much time do I have?

394
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:35,941
You have all the time in the world
as long as you do it within four days.

395
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:40,048
- Four days is just not enough time.
- But we have money.

396
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:43,943
And money has a way
of making time irrelevant.

397
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:47,717
There might even be
something in it for you, John.

398

What do you say
we get this show on the road?

399

who can get a hands-up on that
right away.

410
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:46,082
- Do you have any word on Samuel?
- Loyalty in a mercenary.

411
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:49,983
John, that's a character flaw.

412
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:52,351

- I thought you and she were...
- You're right. I didn't ask.

all the exits will be automatically locked...

519
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:49,652
Yeah, you could blow them in, but with
the amount of explosives you'd need...

It's a string of computer numbers

524
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:06,275

Can anyone tell me why we've put
the control station so far from the prison?

554
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:11,599
Because they invented
wireless transmission.

555
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:14,764
I mean, you did buy us that cellular
relay tower on the mountain, right?

556

Indeed.

557
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:21,578
So, we control half the cellular phone
transmission in the city, why?

558
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:24,043
Because when the prison goes down...

559
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,947
the locals might triangulate
our communication traffic.

560
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:29,882

- Hello, old boy.

to use Maxine as a distraction.

Oh, wrong choice of words.

Sir, we have a Lieutenant Eric Morris from
Cape Town Police Department to see you.

Okay, escort him down.

748

So, what's this about, Lieutenant?

749
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:47,504
As you know we've received
some credible intel that there's...

750
01:05:47,576 --> 01:05:49,669
a bomb threat here,
particularly in the black vault.

751

I haven't heard a thing.

- Stanley Morgan.
- Okay, Stanley.

758
01:06:22,044 --> 01:06:24,069
We can do this the easy way
or the hard way.

759
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:26,944
Easy way is you're gonna tell me
what I need to know and I'll be out.

760
01:06:27,016 --> 01:06:29,985
Hard way is I'm gonna be scraping you
off the ground from outside.

I couldn't help you.

All right.
You do have the magnetic keys, don't you?

764

Yeah, but we don't have
the security access codes.
