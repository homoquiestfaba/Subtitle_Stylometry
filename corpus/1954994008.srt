- Merry Christmas.
- I'm not here.

33
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,078
- Mr. Murray's suite.
- I'm already dead.

34
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:23,413
- Yes, of course.
- The answer's no.

35
00:03:25,665 --> 00:03:27,709
- Who is it?
- Your producers, Mr. Murray.

36
00:03:27,793 --> 00:03:30,963
They're outside.
They've heard your beautiful voice, sir.

37
00:03:31,046 --> 00:03:34,007
- God hates me.
- Forgive me, Mr. Murray.

38
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:37,302
But God is your biggest fan.
Number one fan.

39
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:39,721
Truly a huge fan, Mr. Murray.

40
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,224
- You really think so?
- Number one, sir. Number one.

41
00:03:43,308 --> 00:03:45,060
- Hey!
- Hey!

42
00:03:45,268 --> 00:03:47,146
Murray Christmas!

43
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:48,438
- Get it?
- Yeah...

44
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:52,484
- Wow, you look festive.
- I would lose those antlers.

45
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:56,529
Has anyone shown up for this thing?

46
00:03:57,197 --> 00:03:59,240
- We're here.
- Yeah, so that's one friend.

47
00:03:59,324 --> 00:04:01,201
- Paul's here.
- Yeah, Paul's here.

48
00:04:01,284 --> 00:04:03,328
I wouldn't miss this nutty gig
for the world.

49
00:04:03,411 --> 00:04:06,289
What are you worried about?
Come on. Let's do the show.

50
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:08,750
- Chop, chop.
- There's no one moving in the whole city.

51
00:04:08,834 --> 00:04:11,003
The airports are closed.
The trains are closed.

52
00:04:11,086 --> 00:04:14,255
The buses and bridges and tunnels
are not working.

53
00:04:15,048 --> 00:04:19,552
A couple of saloons have closed.
The entire city of New York is shut down.

54
00:04:20,345 --> 00:04:23,140
And you're expecting me to go downstairs
and do a show?

55
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:27,310
- Anything that's fun is always hard.
- That's right.

56
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,815
Oh, it's a miracle.
You two are going to shut up for a second.

57
00:04:32,983 --> 00:04:35,027
- Please be George.
- Please be George.

58
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,695
- Hey.
- Is it George Clooney?

59
00:04:36,778 --> 00:04:38,238
- Is it Clooney?
- Is it Clooney?

60
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:40,657
- Is he on the phone?
- Please, God, let it be Clooney.

61
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,283
How did you get this number?

62
00:04:43,493 --> 00:04:47,372
Now, you'd better tell me because
I'm going to find out. I am working.

63
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:51,960
Don't ever do this again.
Ever. You got it?

64
00:04:57,132 --> 00:04:59,885
- My sister.
- Family is important.

65
00:05:00,093 --> 00:05:02,012
I need you to produce!

66
00:05:02,095 --> 00:05:03,471
- Okay.
- Okay.

67
00:05:03,555 --> 00:05:06,599
- How do we cancel this?
- Okay. I understand why you're frustrated.

68
00:05:06,683 --> 00:05:09,228
I would be frustrated, too.
Maybe we shouldn't do it.

69
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,730
- Bev, should we cancel it?
- Okay. You two, grow up.

70
00:05:11,813 --> 00:05:14,399
The satellite is bought and paid for
and non-refundable.

71
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:16,776
- So we can't cancel.
- You've got to try to cancel.

72
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,445
- We placed all the ads, man.
- Which is so exciting!

73
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:23,242
- The network has been pro-mo'ing this.
- They are very jazzed about it.

74
00:05:23,324 --> 00:05:26,786
And I don't want to tell you how
personally on the hook you are for this.

75
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,747
You do not want to get sued, Bill.

76
00:05:28,955 --> 00:05:31,541
You don't want to be personally
on the hook. That is scary.

77
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:33,126
So we've got some weather issues.

78
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:36,046
Hold on, Bev.
Bill might have a right. Maybe...

79
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:40,175
Bill has a contractual right to do the
best fucking Christmas show that he can.

80
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:42,594
Let me guess. You're the bad cop.

81
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:44,846
Yeah, I'm sorry.
That was a little over the top.

82
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,056
Hey.

83
00:05:47,432 --> 00:05:49,559
- Think of the troops.
- Yeah.

84
00:05:49,642 --> 00:05:54,731
Right? And the kids in hospitals.
And pets outside.

85
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,233
I need my antlers!

86
00:05:56,316 --> 00:05:58,026
You always forget them.

87
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,612
- Jackpot! Here we go.
- Thanks, Paul. Come on.

88
00:06:01,238 --> 00:06:02,655
Here we go. Here we go.

89
00:06:04,032 --> 00:06:05,284
No, no, no, no. No elevator.

90
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:08,745
The little guys in uniforms who run
these things couldn't make it in today.

91
00:06:08,828 --> 00:06:12,207
Yeah, we're walking. A little exercise
is not going to kill you.

92
00:06:12,874 --> 00:06:16,211
- Come on.
- Goodness me. Dimitri, hold onto these.

This is your idea of a Christmas
special? This is a national disgrace.

99
00:06:37,774 --> 00:06:41,402
Alright, stand down, Double D.
He's just a Hollywood sleaze bag.

100
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:45,365
I don't even know how to express
my shame in this moment.

101
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:48,618
The Murricane
skulking down the back stairs

102
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:51,704
like some 25-dollar-an-hour
Twin Cities hooker.

103
00:06:51,913 --> 00:06:57,043
Go away. I told you.
I don't want a manager, especially you.

104
00:06:57,252 --> 00:06:59,545
Maybe not. But you definitely need one.

105
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:05,760
Bill, Billy, this sad excuse for
a Christmas special... No harm intended...

106
00:07:05,844 --> 00:07:07,095
Oh, none taken.

107
00:07:07,179 --> 00:07:09,848
Seems more like a Christ-mess,
as in, what a mess!

108
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:14,019
We have George Clooney.

109
00:07:14,853 --> 00:07:16,562
I rest my case.

110
00:07:16,646 --> 00:07:17,814
You saw <i>Monuments Men?</i>

111
00:07:18,023 --> 00:07:20,817
- I was in it.
- Number what? Seven on the call sheet?

112
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,735
- You were so good in that.
- You were great.

113
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:23,862
You were very good.

114
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,865
What I'm saying
is we all love George, right?

115
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:29,034
He and I are close.
He's a citizen of the world.

116
00:07:29,117 --> 00:07:31,328
But we need size. We need edge.

117
00:07:31,536 --> 00:07:35,540
If security had come in today,
I would be calling them right now.

118
00:07:35,748 --> 00:07:39,502
Look, just sign with me today, okay?
I know you're a big fish.

119
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:42,463
But you're not going to snap my line,
okay? I'm hanging on tight.

120
00:07:42,547 --> 00:07:44,424
Here's our Murricane special.

121
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:47,093
Blimp shot down
into Dallas Cowboys Stadium...

122
00:07:47,302 --> 00:07:49,054
- Done it.
- Retractable roof opens.

123
00:07:49,137 --> 00:07:52,557
- 80,000 screaming fans.
- Yeah.

124
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,517
What? You do it in post.

125
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,601
Camera zooms in.

126
00:07:55,685 --> 00:08:00,023
We see Miley Cyrus wearing a sexy
red mini skirt, sitting on a white sleigh.

127
00:08:00,106 --> 00:08:01,733
- You run in...
- Miley's in Tahoe.

128
00:08:02,901 --> 00:08:07,488
I know Miley.
And that may or may not be true.

129
00:08:07,697 --> 00:08:09,866
Okay, you just have to go away. I'm sorry.

130
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:14,162
Please just go as far away
as your company will send you.

131
00:08:14,246 --> 00:08:17,040
Miss, could you check him, please?
Thank you.

132
00:08:17,123 --> 00:08:19,667
I've heard that one.
You better check yourself, Bill.

133
00:08:19,751 --> 00:08:22,379
You better run like a thief
from this car wreck.

134
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:24,714
Total disaster.

135
00:08:26,299 --> 00:08:28,093
Total disaster.

136
00:08:29,761 --> 00:08:30,762
Are you an actress?

137
00:08:36,101 --> 00:08:39,896
<i>Tonight, Christmas Eve, from
the legendary Hotel Carlyle in New York,</i>

138
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:42,148
<i>Bill Murray
and his celebrity friends gather...</i>

139
00:08:42,357 --> 00:08:43,983
See, Bill? Easy peasy.

140
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:49,281
We cut from you here live on stage,
to your guests' pre-taped reaction shots.

141
00:08:49,364 --> 00:08:52,117
No one knows you aren't
in the same room together. Boom, done.

142
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,827
- A Christmas miracle.
- You've got to be kidding.

143
00:08:56,496 --> 00:09:00,083
This is from last year's Golden Globes.
That's not going to match.

144
00:09:00,292 --> 00:09:03,378
Yeah, match it...
What does it have to match?

145
00:09:03,462 --> 00:09:05,880
It's all just fantasy, right?

146
00:09:05,964 --> 00:09:09,468
I mean, we're the weavers of dreams.
We're the makers of merry.

147
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,845
- This is all just an illusion.
- Absolutely. It's all an illusion, Bill.

148
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:15,890
That's Brad Pitt and Angelina.
They're in Africa.

149
00:09:15,974 --> 00:09:17,434
And it's daytime in Africa.

150
00:09:17,517 --> 00:09:20,770
They're not in New York at Bemelmans.
They're in Africa.

151
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:22,522
Those are huts.

152
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:23,731
Who sees a hut?

153
00:09:23,815 --> 00:09:27,110
Come on. Bill, calm down and trust us.

154
00:09:27,193 --> 00:09:30,155
Were you nominated for an Emmy
for producing the SAG awards?

155
00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:31,823
- No.
- Neither were we.

156
00:09:32,491 --> 00:09:35,576
So get up there and do the show.
We go live in 90 seconds.

157
00:09:35,785 --> 00:09:40,206
Bill, I think it's a blessing
that these people didn't show up.

158
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:43,293
Because now it's your time, you know.

159
00:09:43,502 --> 00:09:46,587
The universe gives us many gifts.
It's whether or not we receive them.

160
00:09:46,671 --> 00:09:49,757
- That's right. Receive the gift.
- This job is always surprising me.

161
00:09:50,383 --> 00:09:53,386
- I'm so alone.
- Okay, Bill...

162
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,929
- You know...
- We're with you...

163
00:09:55,013 --> 00:09:56,222
You know, you and I...

00:09:57,307 --> 00:09:59,017
we're not in the same business.

165
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,773
Okay, there he goes. He's going.

166
00:10:05,857 --> 00:10:08,860
Bill, I don't want to pressure you,
but one minute until air.

167
00:10:08,943 --> 00:10:11,696
Five cameras. I like our chances
of someone getting it right.

168
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:15,033
60 seconds! He's going up.
Let's get ready. Are you ready, Paul?

169
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:17,910
- Ready!
- Alright.

170
00:10:17,994 --> 00:10:21,039
- What are we doing?
- Let's jingle those bells, buddy.

171
00:10:21,122 --> 00:10:23,666
We're going live
in five seconds, everyone.

172
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,044
Is there a microphone
or do we imagine that, too?

173
00:10:26,252 --> 00:10:28,338
- Use your stage voice.
- Yeah.

174
00:10:28,421 --> 00:10:29,506
You're on stage.

175
00:10:29,714 --> 00:10:31,341
There we go. Look.

176
00:10:32,008 --> 00:10:35,554
- We've got one sound guy.
- Swing the camera. The other way.

00:10:37,847 --> 00:10:39,474
You people are disgusting.

178
00:10:39,558 --> 00:10:41,684
- You're looking great up there.
- Crushing it.

Chris! Chris!

206
00:12:12,442 --> 00:12:15,612
Bill, what are you doing here
in the biggest blizzard in the world, man?

207
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,822
- Don't leave. Don't leave.
- I'm not...

208
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:20,241
Don't leave. Stay, Chris. Stay.

209
00:12:20,325 --> 00:12:22,910
Go around. You can't go that way.

210
00:12:22,994 --> 00:12:26,456
- Counter-clockwise. Counter-clockwise.
- Counter-clockwise!

211
00:12:26,539 --> 00:12:27,957
The other way.

212
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:33,505
- Counter-clockwise. You are such a pro!
- It's a pleasure.

213
00:12:33,588 --> 00:12:37,049
Counter-clockwise. Chris!

214
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:39,678
What's up, man?

215
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,220
How did you get uptown?

216
00:12:41,304 --> 00:12:43,431
- Subway.
- They shut down the subway.

217
00:12:43,515 --> 00:12:46,726
They are. They are.
I had to walk on the rails, man.

218
00:12:47,393 --> 00:12:50,938
- Sit down with me, buddy.
- I'm sitting down, man.

219
00:12:51,022 --> 00:12:52,815
What's going on?
What's all this stuff?

220
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:55,109
Well, I'm supposed to be doing
a live TV show.

221
00:12:55,193 --> 00:12:56,736
- Okay.
- Live Christmas special.

222
00:12:56,819 --> 00:12:58,321
- Are you in it?
- It just started.

223
00:12:58,404 --> 00:13:00,823
- I'm the only one.
- Oh, man.

224
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:04,744
You're doing a live special in the middle
of the biggest blizzard of the year.

225
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:07,288
That is so you, Bill. That is so you.

226
00:13:07,497 --> 00:13:08,914
- But now you're here.
- Yeah.

227
00:13:08,998 --> 00:13:10,833
- And it's us.
- No!

228
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,585
- Yeah!
- No!

229
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:16,756
- Dust off the pipes a little bit. Sing a...
- I don't sing, Bill.

230
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:19,258
- You sing. You're a rapper.
- I don't rap.

231
00:13:19,467 --> 00:13:21,302
Do you know me?

232
00:13:21,386 --> 00:13:22,637
Some...

233
00:13:23,555 --> 00:13:25,598
You can do it, Chris.
You've got to help me.

234
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,933
You can be the guy that saved Christmas.

235
00:13:28,017 --> 00:13:30,144
I don't want to...
I can save your Christmas.

236
00:13:30,228 --> 00:13:33,314
But what about mine? I've got
to get out of here. I've got stuff to do.

237
00:13:33,398 --> 00:13:34,982
I've got to get home and build stuff.

238
00:13:35,066 --> 00:13:37,193
I've got to build
a Malibu Barbie Beach House.

239
00:13:37,402 --> 00:13:39,654
- You can't leave. You're trapped here.
- Bill.

240
00:13:39,738 --> 00:13:41,280
- No way you get out of here.
- Bill.

241
00:13:41,364 --> 00:13:44,450
Now, look. All you've got to do
is come in, sing a couple of songs.

242
00:13:44,534 --> 00:13:47,704
Dance a little bit, you know.
We'll put you in some cool clothes.

243
00:13:47,787 --> 00:13:52,166
And I swear on my life I will get you
on the first snowmobile in the morning.

244
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,918
Bill, I barely know you, okay?

245
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:55,712
- I just met you...
- This is our chance!

246
00:13:55,795 --> 00:13:58,172
- Where's your boys?
- Let's hang! We've got to hang!

247
00:13:58,256 --> 00:14:03,052
Where's George Clooney?
Matt Damon or John Goodman? Your boys!

248
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:04,345
Why am I here?

249
00:14:04,554 --> 00:14:07,515
Maybe you should postpone this.
Do it a little later.

250
00:14:07,599 --> 00:14:09,308
Is there any way?

251
00:14:09,392 --> 00:14:10,602
No.

252
00:14:10,685 --> 00:14:11,852
I've got to go, Bill.

253
00:14:11,936 --> 00:14:17,400

I am doing a live television special.

399
00:22:56,627 --> 00:22:57,795

00:22:58,462 --> 00:23:00,339
It was supposed to be.

401
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:02,466
But now... no wedding.

402
00:23:03,134 --> 00:23:07,763
Because none of our family or friends
or guests could make it in.

403
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:09,723

404
00:23:11,142 --> 00:23:12,893

405
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,271

409
00:23:29,285 --> 00:23:33,664

just started fighting.

410
00:23:34,332 --> 00:23:35,666

411
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:40,712

That bastard.

412
00:23:42,506 --> 00:23:44,633

For love.

498
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:06,705
The question is, are you in the mood
for a lifetime of regret and loneliness?

499
00:29:06,913 --> 00:29:08,081
Please go away.

500
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:12,043
I can't. I'm a ghost. I've got to keep
haunting and haunting and haunting.

501
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:15,547
There's a lovely girl
in the lobby, crying.

502
00:29:15,631 --> 00:29:17,675
And not over her dead wedding cake.

503
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:19,801
- See you in a minute.
- Wait...

504
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:24,764
Peaches, love's got an up button
and a down button

505
00:29:24,848 --> 00:29:27,058
and you decide which one to push.

506
00:29:27,142 --> 00:29:28,185
What?

507
00:29:28,268 --> 00:29:29,936
You ever try a "soiled kimono"?

508
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,730
- No. I...
- Just drink it.

509
00:29:33,691 --> 00:29:35,734
That's it. There you go.

510
00:29:36,485 --> 00:29:37,528
And listen.

511
00:29:44,075 --> 00:29:45,118

I think she means you.

Okay, now tell me your theory of love.

571
00:33:05,985 --> 00:33:08,154
Well, it's really more of a philosophy.

Whatever.

577
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,473
you were in love.

578
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,312
And then what?

579
00:33:42,522 --> 00:33:43,899
And then sing about it.

580
00:33:44,649 --> 00:33:45,692
To you?

581
00:33:46,902 --> 00:33:47,945
To each other.
