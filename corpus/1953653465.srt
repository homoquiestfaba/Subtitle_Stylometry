1
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,851
<i>I just don't want
to make one of these tapes</i>

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,764
<i>if it's something you do
with every girl.</i>

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,528
Every girl? No, no.
I am strictly a one-woman guy.

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,808
Well, I don't want to end up
all over the Internet.

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,167
I pride myself on keeping a low profile.

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,721
- My private life is private.
- Hm.

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,170
Wait. I thought you never did this
before. What are all these?

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,210
Oh, uh, just some movies I rented.

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,081
"Me and Brandy, Missionary"?

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,931
A tale of two girls who become nuns.

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,445
"Me and Brandy, Doggy"?

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,122
The sequel. The nuns
adopt a chocolate lab.

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,282
What are all those?

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,811
Oh, that's just your standard

15
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,361
home security setup.
Basic run-of-the mill.

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,000
No big deal, nothing too elaborate.
Everybody has them.

17
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,891
And why do you need security cameras
pointing at your bed?

18
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,361
In case a burglar tries
to steal my sex tapes.

19
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,760
Now, let's get into bed.

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,520
Let's just make this quick.
I have a court hearing in the morning.

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,450
- Judge Henderson?
- No. I wish. Thompson.

22
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,682
Mm. That's going to suck for you.

23
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,201
It was a driving mishap thingy.

24
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,283
Do me a favor.
Promise me you won't drive.

25
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,329
That's sweet.
You're worried about me driving.

26
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,563
Mm-mm. I'm worried about me.
I'm a pedestrian.

27
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,211
Ow!

28
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,840
Sorry. That's my sobriety monitor.

29
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,681
Ow!

30
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,842
Sorry. Sorry.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,604
Ankle. Tracking bracelet.

32
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,407
Oh, wait. Wait. Sorry, just...

33
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,568
- Who put that on you?
- I did.

34
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,324
It's the only way
I can have an orgasm.

35
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,928
Not tonight.

36
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,005
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

37
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,249
Just... warming up.

38
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,206
You sure we're alone here? Feels like
there's somebody else in this house.

39
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,840
Did you hear that?

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,207
That's nothing.

41
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,521
OK, what is that?

42
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,967
Just... unraveling the old hose.

43
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,809
Save it for tomorrow, Raul.

44
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,610
<i>Si, senor.</i>

45
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,889
Wow. That was amazing.

46
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,201
Charlie.

47
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,643
- Wow.
- Get out of here, Emilio.

48
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,324
Charlie, I'm scared.

49
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,440
Lindsay, sweetie,
there's nothing to be afraid of.

50
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,928
- <i>Hey, lgot</i> the stuff.
- I got to call you back, man.

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,445
I think I better go.

52
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,089
Really? How about tomorrow? You busy?

53
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,011
I'm going to blow you
across the room.

54
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,491
Sounds awesome.

55
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,004
<i>And thus our story begins.</i>

56
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,687
<i>The large reward offered
for the rescue of Charlie's kids</i>

57
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,411
<i>drew the attention of police,
private detectives</i>

58
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,927
<i>and Red Cross volunteers.</i>

59
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,129
<i>Everyone was on high alert
for these children,</i>

60
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,209
<i>except these two guys.</i>

61
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,807
No, man, Obamacare gives senior citizens
access to cheaper drugs,

62
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,124
free preventative care, and it closes
the Medicare Part D loophole.

63
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,931
And how does that help ifl get
shampoo in my dick hole?

64
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,605
- What?
- Mean to tell me you ain't never got

65
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,410
shampoo in your pee hole?

66
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,085
- Maybe like once or twice.
- Yeah, once or twice

67
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,844
when you was playing with yourself.

68
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,764
No, I wasn't playing with myself.

69
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,082
I was showering,
and crazy got up in there.

70
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,084
Bullshit. Cam Newton's
law of gravity is:

71
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,323
That thing must be up
in order for that soap to go down.

72
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,330
Well, either way,
that shit stings like hell.

73
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,171
Sting like a mother, man, it feel
like it's a hornet up in there.

74
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,443
And he found out his girl be, you know,
doing her thing with another man.

75
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,489
- Exactly.
- I don't understand why

76
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,404
the shampoo company
can't fix that, man.

77
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,130
They got "No More Tears."

78
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,964
Why they can't make no more
hornets in your dick?

79
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,960
I don't really think they expect you
to use the No More Tears on your dick.

80
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,721
Well, why they call it
Johnson & Johnson?

81
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,400
I got a better question, man.
What the hell are two stoners doing

82
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,209
wandering around
these spooky-ass woods?

83
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,762
Look, it's going to be worth it.
I told you... this is Humboldt County.

84
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,003
This is where all the growers
grow their bomb-ass shit.

85
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,208
You think they're gonna be cool
with us just helping ourselves?

86
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,885
Look, man, we ain't taking no plants.

87
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,008
We're gonna snip a few buds.
You know what I'm saying?

88
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,764
It's gonna grow back
just like a lobster paw.

89
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,160
You know, that's how nature do.

90
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,004
I don't know, man.
Just doesn't feel right.

91
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,480
Man, they ain't gonna care.
Look, man, we're gonna be cool.

92
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,086
We're gonna roll one blunt,
then we're gonna get up out of here.

93
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,203
- Just one?
- Just one.

94
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,648
- They won't care, huh?
- Man, just keep running.

95
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,929
Holy shit. Ls that a drone? They're
going all Zero Dark <i>Thirty</i> on our ass.

96
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,683
Yo, I think they gone.

97
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,649
Oh, whoa. It's a cabin in the woods.
We need to go hide over in there.

98
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,171
Nah, man, I'm not going in there.

99
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,526
It reminds me of a horror movie
I once saw.

100
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,883
- What horror movie?
- The one with the cabin in the woods.

101
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,565
- <i>Friday the 13th?</i>
- <i>No.</i>

102
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,210
The one with the cabin in the woods.

103
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,725
Texas <i>Chain</i> Saw Massacre?

104
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,928
No, the one with the cabin
in the woods.

105
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,491
- The <i>Ring.</i>
- Uh-uh.

106
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,246
- <i>The one with the</i> cabin <i>in the woods.</i>
- <i>Blair Witch Project.</i>

107
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,681
No, man, the one
with the cabin in the woods.

108
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,569
- The Munsters.
- That wasn't in the woods.

109
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,563
- They wasn't even a damn movie.
- Look, man,

110
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,360
we ain't got time
for this shit right now.

111
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,329
We need to get to that cabin
in the woods.

112
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,802
What the hell is that sound?

113
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,691
Sound like the house settling.
It looked new.

114
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,604
- I'm gonna take a look around.
- Go ahead.

115
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,081
Ah! What is that?

116
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,171
Ah!

117
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,565
- Where we shooting?
- There.

118
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,006
- Where?
- The dark!

119
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,611
- There?
- No, this dark.

120
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,362
Over there.

121
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,405
Dude, what the hell was that?

122
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,291
Big-ass Alaskan king crab
just ran up on me, man.

123
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,090
- Crab? Cuz, we banging?
- Ja'Marcus,

124
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,441
- put the guns down, man.
- Put yours down first, homey.

125
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,842
All right, on three. One, two, three.

126
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,650
- Damn.
- You want to try it again?

127
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,963
Sure. One, two, three.

128
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,724
One, two, three.

129
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,731
<i>Uno, dos, tres.</i>

130
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,962
Man, we could do this shit all day.

131
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,804
- Truce?
- Truce.

132
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,488
Hey, yo, D'Andre. Look, homey.
It's two little girls.

133
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,768
They're little racist girls, man.

134
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,163
Wearing blackface. Cool with that?

135
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,730
Hey, little girl, what's your name?

136
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,650
- What'd she say?
- She said, "l wonder what your leg"

137
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,126
- "tastes like."
- What? Ah, man!

138
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,645
Little spider girl bit me.

139
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,006
Maybe you're going to get superpowers.

140
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,003
- Ain't no black superheroes.
- I'm on it.

141
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,605
<i>'</i> Hi-ya!

142
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,006
Yo. D'Andre, I think they're
the missing kids from the news.

143
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,525
- How can you be so sure?
- Look.

144
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,001
- I don't know, man.
- Well, if it is the missing kids,

145
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,160
I'm gonna take that reward money,
and I'm gonna buy me

146
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,244
a yacht, fill it with cash,
bitches and a shark.

147
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,761
Why would you want to buy a shark?

148
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,803
Trust me... we're gonna need a shark.

149
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,211
No, this can't be right.

150
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,331
Hi, Mom.

151
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,924
I got to call you back.

152
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,963
No baby, no baby, no baby, no baby.

153
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,645
- <i>You're pregnant...</i>
<i>- No!</i>

154
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,725
<i>With anticipation over
the outcome of this iPregnancy test,</i>

155
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,804
<i>which has determined that you are...</i>

156
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,371
You got to be kidding me.

157
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,241
Oh, no.

158
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,925
<i>Not pregnant.</i>

159
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,009
<i>You dodged</i> a <i>bullet, you lucky slut.</i>

160
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,084
Thank you, God. Sweet!

161
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,403
Great news:
They found my brother's kids.

162
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,846
Oh, crap.

163
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,571
<i>We're very fortunate
the older one, Kathy, has retained</i>

164
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,205
most of her vocabulary.

165
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,488
The baby hasn't actually said a word.

166
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,968
- Why not?
- Because he's a baby.

167
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,567
They've been alone here
over three long months.

168
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,362
I need to warn both of you
that this is not going to be easy.

169
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,602
I'm ready for it.

170
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,286
- Hello.
- No, no. Wrong window.

171
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,920
Here's where the children are.

172
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,648
- What is she doing?
- In order to survive

173
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,282
their extreme isolation, the girls
created an imaginary guardian,

174
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,650
a parent figure to feed them,
sing to them. They call her Mama.

175
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,446
But these may help you break through.

176
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,329
And the Ritalin may help, as well.

177
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,767
The proper dosage
for someone their age is...

178
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,206
Wish me luck.

179
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,250
Hey, Lily.

180
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,970
Oh, how cute.

181
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,643
Kathy.

182
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,726
It's OK, Kathy. Remember these?

183
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,565
You used to wear them
to help you see better.

184
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,650
No, no, no!

185
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,844
Maybe we should get her
some contacts... the soft kind.

186
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,011
Daddy?

187
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,366
No, sweetheart. Not Daddy.

188
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,164
I'm your Uncle Dan. Remember?

189
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,765
And this is Jody.

190
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,888
Jo... d)'-

191
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,884
Jody.
No pause between "Jo" and "dy."

192
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,008
Jo... d)'-

193
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,601
Dan, we're at an impasse.
I see constant conflict.

194
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,808
It's fine. They'll warm up to you.

195
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,371
<i>~</i> [Child grow, -

196
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,000
Hey, hey, hey, little lady,
that's not how...

197
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,810
You little mother...!

198
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,047
Well, everything checks out.
They seem like good kids, Doc.

199
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,486
Just validate our parking.
We'll take them home.

200
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,927
- Folks, I wish it were that easy.
- You don't validate?

201
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,321
I'm saying the kids
are not yours to take.

202
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,448
Well, you can't win them all.
Let's skedaddle.

203
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,611
That's not fair. They're my brother
Charlie's kids. We deserve them.

204
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,128
Do you? Your wife plays in a punk rock
band, staying out all night long,

205
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,965
high on drugs, sleeping with
a different man every night.

206
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,885
I don't think the courts
are gonna look upon that too favorably.

207
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,371
- But...
- I was just messing with you.

208
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,800
- The kids are yours.
- They are?

209
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,481
Did you hear that, honey? They're ours!

210
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,127
On one condition. This house is owned
by the Institute for Case Studies.

211
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,328
Every room is fully wired with cameras.

212
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,086
If you move into the house,
you get the kids.

213
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,130
Can't we just sell the house and put
the kids in a high-end orphanage?

214
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,487
Jody, do you really think
you're cut out to be a mom?

215
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,641
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

216
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,046
- Of course she is.
- Dan!

217
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,124
Now, no more rock band,
no more silly wig.

218
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,362
It's not silly. It's all a part of me.

219
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,363
- And no more tattoos.
- What are you doing?

220
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,166
What I had to.
We're a perfect suburban couple.

221
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,087
<i>And so Dan and Jody headed to
their new house with their new children.</i>

222
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,562
<i>But, like</i> a <i>slutty sorority girl
returning from spring break,</i>

223
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,282
<i>they were also bringing home</i>
a <i>hidden evil.</i>

224
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,171
All right, kids,
here's our new house.

225
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,924
And here's Uncle Dan.

226
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,283
Hi. Don't forget about mommy!

227
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,240
Dan, I'm not their mommy.
They can call me Aunt Jody.

228
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,641
Or Jodes, J-Mom, Mrs. Sanders.

229
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,600
Or, if they really want
to call me... Garage!

230
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,370
Here comes Jody and Aidan,

231
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,200
entering the house
for the very first time.

232
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,921
This is where we're going to protect you
and make sure nothing bad...

233
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,760
Oh, my God, Aidan!
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

234
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,643
Maybe we should put him in the carrier.

235
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,010
- There, see, that's better.
- Come on, Aidan. What, what, what?

236
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,447
- Relax, it's OK.
- Oh, my gosh.

237
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,443
- Dan, I lost the baby!
- What?

238
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,410
Oh, my gosh, Aidan!
Aidan, where are you?!

239
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,686
- Aidan!
- Where did you go?

240
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:15,084
Oh, there he is, OK.

241
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,129
Here's your sister Kathy.

242
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,611
Oh, Aidan, it's OK.

243
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,489
You've just got to talk
in a baby voice.

244
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,849
It doesn't even matter what you say.

245
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,162
I'm your stepmommy.

246
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,046
I'm not your fricking mommy.

247
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,441
There you go, you're a natural.

248
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,688
What's that smell?

249
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,244
Oh, my God, what do I do?
Oh, oh! Here, this, hold on!

250
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,444
<i>'</i> Uncle Dan!

251
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,207

252
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,927
All right, there you go, sweetie.

253
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,448
Is it chilly in here? I felt it
as soon as I entered the room.

254
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,682
Feels fine. Hey, what are these?

255
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,491
This is interesting. What is this?

256
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,246
I don't know, Mama drew that one.

257
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,131
Look, we drew this picture for Aidan.

258
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,403
See? It's Aidan
on a rocket to the moon.

259
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,610
- Oh. Sitting on a rocket.
- Where's Lily?

260
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,362
Oh, no, sweetie, the other end.

261
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,770
Ooh!

262
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,167
Let's go introduce Aidan
to the rest of the family.

263
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,601
[ﬂhud]

264
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,411
Oh, and there's
our furry family member.

265
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,131
- Yes, Maria.
- No, Dan, Artie.

266
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,248
Oh, yes, of course, our dog Artie.

267
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,324
- Ay, the new baby. I make blessing.
- Oh.

268
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,169
OK, OK, that's good, Maria.

269
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,005
Oh, my gosh.

270
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,849
<i>With three new kids
to care for,</i>

271
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,890
<i>Dan really needed
to start performing at work.</i>

272
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,761
<i>Unfortunately he was having
some issues with a colleague.</i>

273
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,481
OK, Caesar, this is
the one, I can feel it.

274
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,888
Eighty-one seconds? Oh, Caesar.

275
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,247
That's your worst time yet.

276
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,880
You're doing even worse
on your creativity test.

277
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,601
I mean, look at all the imaginative
things I made out of blocks.

278
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,205
Like this awesome plane.

279
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,049
Dan, do you have any results yet?

280
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,851
Oh, well, I've been injecting
the primates twice a day

281
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,800
with the I-13 intelligence drug.
I'm hoping in a week or so...

282
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,964
I hope Caesar is notjust
a big waste of time and money.

283
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,761
I'm the one responsible to the board.
Just show me one thing positive.

284
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,371
Look. They still throw their shit.

285
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,727
But now they can keep score.

286
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,046
We have to kick-start this thing.
When can we go to human trials?

287
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,041
We're close, but there's
an intermediate step.

288
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,562
If the I-13 works
on these reality wives...

289
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,769
- You better check that shit.
- Who gonna check me, boo?

290
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,727
We're pinning the future
of our lab on wild beasts.

291
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,723
They're not beasts.

292
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,247
They have feelings, they have families.

293
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,165
Males pee standing up,
females pee sitting down.

294
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,482
These apes are just like you.

295
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,530
And me... you and me, blacks and whites.

296
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,002
More like whites, of course.
We whites are a lighter shade of ape

297
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,004
whereas you are bla... dder infection,
we're all at risk.

298
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,367
So, what were we talking
about again? Vaginas.

299
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,851
- Shut up.
- Yes, of course.

300
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,401
Caesar has got to show some human
intelligence at that board meeting...

301
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,769
Caesar's probably smarter
than half of those board members.

302
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,206
- Dan...
- I know what you're going to say.

303
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,045
"If he's so smart,
why is he in a cage?"

304
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,881
You're in the cage.

305
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,050
What?

306
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,684
- Oh, you're looking for this?
- Uh-huh.

307
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,841
It's my ballerina doll.

308
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,165
- You made this?
- Mama did,

309
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,490
using twigs, moss, spiderwebs,
sparrow bones, lizard eyes,

310
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,610
- all held together with rat droppings.
- Oh, geez.

311
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,524
Ah, ah, ah. What... what are you doing?

312
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,160
I just can't deal with these kids.
They're creepy.

313
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,481
We should just take 'em back.

314
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,962
Maybe you guys just need
to find some common ground.

315
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,440
What about that ballerina doll
Kathy's always playing with?

316
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,123
I don't want to talk about the ballet.

317
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,408
I saw what the ballet did to my mom.

318
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,089
<i>She became obsessed.</i>

319
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,881
<i>She even danced the swan
while she was pregnant with me.</i>

320
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,127
- Boo, ray, boo!
- Shh!

321
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,369
Shh. Hell. You better sit back
before I punch you in your damn throat.

322
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,521
We're trying to enjoy the show.

323
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,446
You go on... shh... shh me again.
I double-dog dare you, hell.

324
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,568
Better ask somebody who I am.

325
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,724
Whoa!

326
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,091
Got it.

327
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,604
Mom was never the same.

328
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,368
That's unlikely
to ever happen again, ever.

329
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,842
Just give it a shot.
Look what I found earlier.

330
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,490
I mean, I know
it's just a local production.

331
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:26,248
But could be something for you
and Kathy to talk about, could be fun.

332
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,085
- You really think so?
- Yes.

333
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,528
Well, I suppose I could check it out.

334
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,763
OK. But the minute it becomes
too difficult, I'm giving up.

335
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,686
That's the spirit.

336
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,720
<i>Even though Jody
only returned to the ballet</i>

337
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,484
<i>to connect with the girls,</i>

338
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,486
<i>as she got closer she couldn't help
but get excited at the prospect</i>

339
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,803
<i>of becoming the Swan Queen.</i>

340
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,201
This season we open with "Swan Lake."

341
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,400
As you all know, this piece
has the most challenging

342
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,605
and demanding role in all
of ballet... the Swan Queen.

343
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,330
<i>Sizing up her competition,</i>

344
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,245
<i>Jody knew the battle
would be</i> a <i>tough one.</i>

345
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,368
The white and the black.

346
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,524
Fortunately we have with us
prima ballerina and the lead

347
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,810
in my last 146 productions...
Heather Darcy.

348
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,845
Ah, the seasoned professional.

349
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,401
The still brilliant,
crusty, old, weathered,

350
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,764
leather-faced elder statesman of ballet
to whom these young girls,

351
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,764
less experienced,
more beautiful and delicious,

352
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:44,720
but still very raw ballerina hopefuls,
look up.

353
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,487
Show these far more desirable children
how it's done, huh?

354
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,642
Music!

355
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,200
Try that thing where you are skipping

356
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,448
and you hop and you spread
your legs a little bit.

357
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,287
Look at that form,
that technique.

358
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,090
I'll never be that good.

359
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,805
I'm Jody, by the way.

360
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,883
Kendra.

361
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,966
" Are yQu - mlgék“ " v out?

362
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,442
Oh, I don't know.
I mean, I like to dance, but I just...

363
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,329
I don't like to be the
center of attention.

364
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,446
- OK, who's next?
- Oh, food.

365
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,843
It is as if I am seeing ballet
for the first time.

366
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,851
That's not ballet.

367
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,447
The passion, the sensuality.

368
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,883
An ass that makes you want to
crawl inside and take up residence.

369
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,526
I can show passion.

370
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,366
Oh, yeah.

371
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,121
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh.

372
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,244
<i>Jody certainly had
her work cut out for her.</i>

373
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,371
<i>That Kendra chick was smokin'.</i>

374
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,204
Do you accept euros?

375
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,249
Kathy, Lily, Aidan?

376
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,247
Jody? Ah!

377
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,925
Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry.

378
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,209
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm fine.

379
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,600
It was on the floor.

380
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,088
Ah, probably a screw loose.
I'll fix it.

381
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,725
I feel like there's
something in this house.

382
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,881
Like what?

383
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,931
Like I feel hot, clammy,
foul-smelling breath on my neck.

384
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,082
You need call psychic.
Kill bad spirits.

385
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,289
- Ugh.
- No, Maria, enough of this stuff.

386
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,569
OK, then I do blessing,
I protect house.

387
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,727
Honey, you really need to relax.

388
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,449
You're just stressed out
about the children.

389
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,444
No, it's this house. I... I feel it.

390
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,922
And Maria's a little off. I mean,
honestly do you really trust her?

391
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,368
Oh, honey, don't worry,
she couldn't hurt a fly.

392
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,361
Look, you have a big day
ahead of you tomorrow.

393
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,807
Let's just get you some sleep, OK?

394
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,761
Love you.

395
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,611
I don't believe this...
our whole house ransacked.

396
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,047
You leave the house unattended
with the doors unlocked

397
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,486
and look what happens.

398
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,371
They didn't take anything.
It's just vandalism.

399
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,761
Every room except
the kids' rooms was trashed.

400
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,921
So you suspect the kids?

401
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,401
It was Mama. Mama did it.

402
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,848
She hates this house.
She hates you.

403
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,966
OK, Maria, this is camera.
Necesito filming.

404
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,009
Thank you for helping me
clean up, sweetie.

405
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,970
Oh, hey, been looking
all over for this thing.

406
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,849
Still got it...

407
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,480
I'm sorry! God, help, honey!

408
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:42,241
Maria, honey, help! Geez!
Maria, put the camera...

409
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,006
Oh, look at this.

410
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,561
Mom coaching me
when I was a little girl.

411
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,202
- Aw...
- Always applying the guilt trip.

412
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,129
That got me the lead.

413
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,444
Look, Maria.

414
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,967
Maria, look what I found. What is this?

415
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:03,927
Oh, uh, that's... a new type
of electric toothbrush.

416
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,527
Vibrations knock the tartar
off your teeth.

417
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,806
- Look, a whole box of toothbrushes.
- Whoa.

418
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,162
This black one is huge.

419
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,891
- And look, here's a double-sided one.
- All right.

420
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,088
And one that I can strap on to my face.

421
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,368
Nope. Put that over here.

422
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,330
Uncle Dan, what is this?
Beaded floss?

423
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,608
That's grown-up floss, honey.

424
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,331
Graffiti!

425
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,602
Did you see this?

426
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,923
Who does that?
What are we...? Maria.

427
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,971
Maria, por favor.

428
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,761
Miss Jody, Miss Jody,
you call this man... Mr. Blaine.

429
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,888
He helped my sister.

430
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,481
- This is a psychic.
- <i>Si,</i> he'll help you.

431
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,449
No, what we really need
are more security cameras.

432
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,650
Uncle Dan. You know, these toothbrushes
look an awful lot like dildos.

433
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,241
0w!

434
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,048
This is fun, Mama.

435
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,326
You're still awake?

436
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,926
All right, listen, guys, it'sjust us

437
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,840
until Uncle Dan comes back
from the hospital.

438
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,281
I don't like it,
you don't like it, I don't like it.

439
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,807
Now go to sleep. I have to be up
early for ballet tomorrow.

440
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:54,408
- You really like ballet, don't you?
- Yeah, but I don't want you to go.

441
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,607
Why?

442
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,888
Mama says you're going
to have an accident.

443
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:02,204
Oh, OK. Ls this the same Mama
who trashed the house?

444
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,328
Basically, yes.

445
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,970
Don't go in there.

446
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,882
I wasn't going to.

447
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,326
Just don't.

448
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,171
It's my house, I can if I want.

449
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,521
I wouldn't.

450
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,364
- Would.
- Wouldn't.

451
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,363
- Would, too.
- Would not.

452
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,524
You know what? I'm the adult.
You're not the boss of me.

453
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,681
Don't.

454
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:53,610
I told you
not to let anyone in!

455
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,244
<i>And so Jody was...</i>

456
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,886
<i>Oh, my God, I just smelled that.</i>

457
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,008
<i>It just got to me, yeah.</i>

458
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,804
<i>And so Jody was...</i>

459
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,928
<i>Oh, no, I... I'm sorry,
you have to excuse me.</i>

460
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,246
<i>I got to get some fresh air.</i>

461
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,402
<i>The next section
should explain itself.</i>

462
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,724
<i>All right, attention.</i>

463
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,484
I do not wish to repeat myself.

464
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,286
I repeat, I do not wish
to repeat myself.

465
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,602
I require the sweater
I wear as a scarf.

466
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,011
Ah. Comfortable, huh?

467
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,650
Mm... Mother, please, I am working.

468
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,282
All right, because Heather Darcy
is so old, this season

469
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,249
we will have a new Swan Queen,

470
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,121
and that person is Jody Sanders.

471
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:05,121
Now, Jody, show us your routine.

472
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,011
No, I'm the Swan Queen.

473
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,770
Watch me. Ah...!

474
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,685
As I was saying, my choice for new...

475
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,968
Her?! Anyone but her!

476
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,681
You mightjust as well
have picked the janitor!

477
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,571
" - Me? <i>- 4.</i>"

478
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,651
- Ira, please, not now. OK.
- What?

479
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,802
Yes, it was a difficult decision,

480
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,770
but I have always been
attracted to Jody.

481
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,888
How could I not? She has
the body of a fifth-grade boy.

482
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,004
But in the event that she
is unable to dance,

483
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:48,165
I am naming as her
understudy Kendra Brooks.

484
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,642
All right, that's lunch.

485
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,890
Ooh, this is a nice house.
I'm gonna go find the girls.

486
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Kathy, how did you know I was going to
have an accident today at the ballet?

487
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,286
Mama told me.

488
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,762
OK, well, how did Mama know
I was going to have an accident?

489
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,683
Oh, there you are.
I found this bandage on my head.

490
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,850
Dan, please. I think there is something
going on in this house,

491
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,286
something about this Mama.

492
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,281
I'm gonna call the psychic
Maria told us about.

493
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,080
Jody, do you really
think we need a psychic?

494
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,207
Uncle Dan, come here.

495
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,169
- Coming.
- I want to show you something.

496
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:45,526
Uncle Dan, Mama taught me some tricks.
Look what I can do.

497
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,047
- Oh, wow, that's really good, honey.
- Dada.

498
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,851
Good Lord.

499
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,243
- Uncle Dan, look at me.
- Evil spirits.

500
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,731
Look, Mr. Dan, look.

501
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,645
Isn't that one of Jody's bathing suits?

502
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,849
You're facing something our
human minds cannot imagine.

503
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,520
Mama.

504
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,442
Let's get you in a robe.

505
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,400
Do you want to hear
about the ballet today?

506
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,767
- Mama's helping us get ready.
- Oh, OK, I'll brush, too.

507
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,531
Hm. Where did my toothbrush go?

508
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,400
Hey, we don't lick our balls
in this house.

509
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,927
Sorry, won't happen again.

510
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,965
<i>Try as she might,</i>

511
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,283
<i>Jody just couldn't seem
to connect with those kids.</i>

512
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,091
<i>Or get the taste of that
toothbrush out of her mouth.</i>

513
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,846
<i>Was it just eight-year-old teen angst,</i>

514
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,408
<i>or were there otherworldly
forces at work here?</i>

515
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,205
" Baby, - Hm?"

516
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,521
- Babe, I heard something.
- What?

517
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,727
I think there's someone in the kitchen.

518
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,611
See? There's nobody down here.

519
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,888
There it is again!
Right there. Go look.

520
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:16,125
Jody, calm down. See, there's nothing
to worry about. It's just...

521
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,169
Oh, God! Geez!

522
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,484
Dan, I'm calling the psychic!

523
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,727
Ah! Make the call!

524
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,563
Blaine Fulda, professional psychic.

525
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,051
Hi, I'm Jody.

526
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,601
- Indeed you are.
- Yes. And this is my husband Dan.

527
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,604
Your payment as requested.
$500 in unmarked bills.

528
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,569
And of course, you know Maria.

529
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,246
- Hola, Mr. Blaine.
- Hi, Maria. How's your sister?

530
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,607
Dead. Demon kill her.

531
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,601
Well, that explains
the unreturned phone calls.

532
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,246
I'm sensing evil.

533
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,324
I'm gonna have to get some of
your personal belongings here,

534
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,131
just so I can check for
demon and ghost residue.

535
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,486
I'm not gonna be able
to lift all those monitors,

536
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,849
but I'll send my cousin tomorrow with
the white van. He can get them in there.

537
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,809
Dan was attacked
by the kitchen last night.

538
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,406
- We think it might be Mama.
- Kitchen attack?

539
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,085
You could've said that earlier.

540
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,005
If a room turns on you,
it's either a ghost or a demon.

541
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,609
Can a demon take over someone?
Like, live within them?

542
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,171
Damn, that's some scary shit.

543
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,482
So a demon is about
the worst thing you can have?

544
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,371
No, ma'am, an STD is the
worst thing that you can have.

545
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,002
Who do you know who wants to hurt you?
Do you have a jealous colleague at work?

546
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,083
A Facebook friend
you might have ignored?

547
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,363
Maybe you adopted a small
African child named lkatababwe,

548
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,568
promising to feed
this nigga for 25 cents a day.

549
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,240
But then he needs something to drink!

550
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,521
Anyway, let's begin.

551
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,047
This is the evil communicator.

552
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,124
When I put this on, I'll be able
to cross over to the other side

553
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,601
and confront the entity.
That will immediately trigger

554
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:46,362
the final $350 payment of
child support to Tisha Fulda.

555
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,808
And if you guys would justjoin hands,
close eyes and concentrate.

556
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,169
Empty your mind of all
the thoughts of today's troubles.

557
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,806
Everything that went on,
get that out of your mind.

558
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,122
This is all about the spirit world here.

559
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:03,564
And three, two and one.

560
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,166
What's happening? Things are starting
to move all by itself!

561
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,684
Breathe! Breathe!

562
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,649
- Wait, I don't think he can breathe!
- He's a pro!

563
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,644
A sophisticated piece of equipment
like that? Of course he can breathe.

564
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,161
Shit, I couldn't breathe.

565
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,051
Almost killed myself.
All right, I communicated.

566
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,601
- It was definitely a demon.
- Oh, my God.

567
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,360
Wait a minute. I was wrong.
It's a ghost.

568
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,005
So strong.

569
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,926
" 0w!"

570
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,966
- Help, it's got me!
- Dan!

571
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,565
- Dan, wake up!
- Ma'am, you got to

572
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:43,088
get out of here. It's evil!
It's pure evil! It's Mama!

573
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,520
Now do you believe
that something's going on?

574
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,921
He got dragged away,
yelling out, "Mama."

575
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,082
He got dragged away?
I don't remember that.

576
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,528
- Dan, you were unconscious.
- I don't remember that, either.

577
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,205
Look, honey, I don't want to argue.

578
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,328
The important thing is,
we love each other, OK?

579
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,920
No, the important thing is that
this Mama thing could be real

580
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,644
and she might be trying to kill us.

581
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,770
Jod, that guy was a fraud
and that's it. OK?

582
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,882
- What's that?
- My penis.

583
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,684
- No.
- Yes.

584
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,489
- There, right now, there.
- I know. I'm trying.

585
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,883
- What the hell is that?
- My penis?

586
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,207
What's making that sound?

587
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,481
Dan, what is that?

588
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,810
MY Denis.

589
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,930
Ls that smoke?

590
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,891
Maria! What are you doing?!
You're gonna burn down the house!

591
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,202
Kill bad spirits!

592
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,842
- What is going on?
- Maria almost burned the house down.

593
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,280
- What?
- That's it, she's got...

594
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:58,922
Enough! This is getting out of hand.
You're scaring everybody.

595
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,128
You can't fire her. I mean,
she's been with us for years.

596
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,611
I don't know what to do.

597
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,842
- That's discrimination.
- OK, now what the hell?

598
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,368
- This is completely insane!
- It's what she believes in, honey!

599
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,646
Give me that!

600
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,644
You're gonna let me go?!
Your family is not safe!

601
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,928
I'm sorry, Maria,
it's just not working out.

602
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,811
I'll give you a recommendation,
just nothing involving kids

603
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,725
or within a mile of anyone's house.

604
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,846
I can't do this anymore.
I got to go to work.

605
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,720
I don't even understand
what you're saying!

606
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,883
0w!

607
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,684
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

608
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,605
for the past two years,
our own Dan Sanders has been

609
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,445
testing the I-13 compound on 30 apes.

610
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,887
Unfortunately, 29 of them turned into

611
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,611
insane, aggressive,
deviant sexual predators.

612
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,802
But one, Caesar,

613
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,043
has experienced a huge leap
in intelligence.

614
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,362
Here he plays three opponents.

615
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,925
Of course, they're apes.

616
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:30,881
But Caesar's superior capabilities
are the work of one man.

617
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,567
The brains behind
the I-13 project, Dan San...

618
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,051
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine, Martin.

619
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,642
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to introduce you to Caesar...

620
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,080
You're not getting away from me!

621
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,009
00f!

622
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,567
Oh, no!

623
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,527
<i>Traffic is backed up
on the Broad Street Bridge,</i>

624
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:14,127
<i>where apparently police are battling
dozens of apes in a running gunfight.</i>

625
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,369
<i>Our reports indicate that</i>
a <i>scientist at</i> a <i>research laboratory</i>

626
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,444
<i>gave these apes an experimental
intelligence drug.</i>

627
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,127
<i>I'm being told that all available
officers are now on the scene.</i>

628
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:29,411
<i>But at this time, we are advising all
our viewers to find alternate routes.</i>

629
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,370
<i>I'm now being told
we have the actual 911 call</i>

630
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,682
<i>that first alerted the police
to the situation.</i>

631
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,121
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

632
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,886
<i>Oh, my God!
Apes are inside the house!</i>

633
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,202
<i>Calm down, ma'am. What happened?</i>

634
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,283
<i>We were making love and...
Oh, my God!</i>

635
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,363
- <i>They're attacking him!</i>
<i>- Who are they attacking, ma'am?</i>

636
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,201
<i>Carl! Oh, my God!
Please, help him!</i>

637
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,680
- <i>Where is your husband right now?</i>
<i>- Carl's not my husband.</i>

638
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,406
<i>My husband's the anchor for
Channel 12 News. He can't know about it.</i>

639
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,130
- <i>OK, ma'am, but we need to...</i>
<i>- Hurry!</i>

640
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,288
<i>Send help while my husband's
still on the air!</i>

641
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,841
<i>Ma 'am, that's not important.
Your life is.</i>

642
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,048
<i>Yeah, you're right.
Why should he</i> care?

643
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:08,483
<i>I mean, I'm pretty sure he's been
sleeping with his co-anchor, that bitch!</i>

644
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,846
<i>Oh, I'm gonna rip her...</i>

645
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,408
<i>Congratulations, girl.</i>

646
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,007
I knew it was gonna be you.
You're just so perfect, so mechanical.

647
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,731
Watching you dance
is like watching a robot.

648
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,086
Thanks.

649
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,924
So hungry.

650
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,521
Mm.

651
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,047
- Is that all?
- Pierre has a weight limit.

652
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,010
I'm too heavy. Look at Mara.

653
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,527
She looks great.

654
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,286
Look, are you sure you're OK?

655
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,961
Weird things have been
happening at home.

656
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,207
Kathy said there was
going to be an accident.

657
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:51,285
- Then it happened to Heather.
- That's some serious shit.

658
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,647
You should talk to those kids.

659
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,370
Whoa, pizza.

660
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:03,527
I eat and eat and eat,
and I don't gain a pound.

661
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,604
Heather!

662
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,485
You think you can replace me?

663
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:38,248
Well, we'll see how you like it
once the swan consumes you!

664
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,763
Damn it!

665
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,685
Door!

666
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,849
Son of a bitch!

667
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,609
Oh, I didn't know
you were such a good builder.

668
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,365
Wow.

669
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:08,563
Kathy, I want you
to tell me about Mama.

670
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,724
Mama doesn't like it
when you talk about her.

671
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:12,927
Who is Mama?

672
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:15,361
She was a woman who
read from an evil book.

673
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,808
Sometimes she comes to us in a dream.

674
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,968
In a dream?

675
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,282
In your dreams, of course.

676
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,283
I wish I could see
what's inside your dreams.

677
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,163
To extract what's in your dreams.
To perform an inception.

678
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,887
Will you drop that?
That's my birth tuba.

679
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,005
Hello. I'm Dom Kolb.
You called about a dream extraction?

680
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,561
Yes. I need to find
out about an evil book.

681
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:44,881
Mm-hm.

682
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,765
This machine will allow us
access to the dream world.

683
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,251
Let's begin.

684
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,164
So when do we start dreaming?

685
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,971
You never really remember
the beginning of a dream,

686
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,326
- do you?
- I guess.

687
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,443
OK, then,

688
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:05,286
this is your first lesson
in shared dreaming. Stay calm.

689
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,125
Sorry. I dropped my phone in there.

690
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,608
You need to clear your subconscious.
And watch what you think about.

691
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,001
- Nothing crazy.
- Right.

692
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,891
Like having your crotch
burst into flames.

693
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:31,203
What does that
have to do with Ma...?

694
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,931
- Hey!
- Oh.

695
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,247
Let's start over.

696
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,128
I'm Jody Sanders.

697
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,362
Yes, my dear. I've been expecting you.

698
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,363
Please, come in.

699
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,170
They call me Christian Grey.

700
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,209
How do you like my blue room?

701
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:00,284
- It's red.
- Oh. I'm color-blind.

702
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,721
My decorator assured me that...
Never mind.

703
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,210
- Champagne?
- Mm.

704
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,965
Have a seat.

705
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,281
I'll stand.

706
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,808
Hey, Christian, man, golly, man!
I'd like to thank you a lot, man,

707
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,321
for working on my prostrate
like it was a speed bag.

708
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,450
Yes, Michael, I must admit, I was
surprised at your performance, as well.

709
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,922
Not bad for a washed-up, overweight,
facially tattooed...

710
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,727
Do it again.

711
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,845
On...!

712
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,571
I have no idea what that one was.

713
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,328
Me neither.

714
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,328
Mama, are you here?

715
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:59,087
- Dom, is that you?
- Oh, shit.

716
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:02,528
You said you'd had a dream
that we'd grow old together.

717
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,409
Right. And we will.

718
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:07,609
- What are you doing here?
- Hi.

719
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,880
How could you bring her here?
What about our children?

720
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,527
- They're not real.
- Yes, they are. Watch.

721
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,768
James, Phillippa!

722
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:18,408
Ew.

723
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,966
You're not gonna jump, are you?

724
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,851
I hadn't thought about that.
Thank you.

725
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:33,927
OK, we're not getting anywhere.

726
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,570
What does any of this
have to do with Kathy?

727
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,529
Kathy? I thought you were Kathy.

728
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,086
Oh.

729
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:00,926
"Gort Klaatu Barada Nikto."

730
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,767
What's happening to me?!

731
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,603
- That must have been her.
- Mama.

732
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,484
She wants to take us home to the cliff.

733
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,769
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

734
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,920
But I trust you'll give me
a favorable Yelp review?

735
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,451
<i>Jody's mission was clear.</i>

736
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,563
<i>The evil book that created Mama</i>

737
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:49,247
<i>was located in the cellar
of a cabin, in the woods.</i>

738
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,570
<i>If she could find that cabin,
maybe she could find some answers.</i>

739
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:56,803
If we can find that cabin,
maybe we can find some answers.

740
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,849
<i>OK, calm down. I'm gonna come over.</i>

741
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,846
- Kendra?
- What?

742
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,643
<i>OK, wait, what's going on now?</i>

743
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,167
I think she's out there!

744
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,722
OK, OK, just... you stay calm!

745
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,001
<i>Front door open.</i>

746
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,288
- She's in the house!
- Front door open.

747
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,568
- OK, stay...
- Front door open.

748
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,171
Shut the hell up!

749
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,970
<i>No need for that, bitch.</i>

750
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,009
- Bitch?!
- Front door open.

751
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,480
- No, you did notjust call me a bitch!
- Front door open...

752
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,051
- HOney?
- Dan?!

753
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:34,171
I am so sorry. I didn't know
who you were and...

754
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:38,046
It's OK, honey, it was an accident.
Right, Caesar?

755
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,971
And of course he can stay here.

756
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,367
Look at that. Caesar wants to help out
around the house.

757
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,521
Aw.

758
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,407
Hey...

759
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,681
I'm sorry, I see an ape,
I come out swinging.

760
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,963
That's understandable.

761
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,645
Here you go.

762
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,770
I am so glad you're OK,
but tonight was a wake-up call.

763
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:10,720
- I think we've got to find that cabin.
- OK. I got an idea.

764
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,282
Wait, we fired Maria.
Who's gonna watch the kids?

765
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,960
I already took care of it.

766
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:21,005
- Naughty Nanny's here.
- Nice to meet you, Naughty.

767
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,249
- This is my wife Jody.
- Threesome? That costs extra.

768
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:28,051
Oh, Jesus. Monkey, too?

769
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:32,125
Oh, you people are freaks,
but for an extra $100.

770
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:33,645
What agency did you call?

771
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,371
Oh, they have nurses
and cheerleaders and nannies.

772
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,807
Dan, you called an escort service.

773
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,645
I used the same agency
to book a Santa for Christmas.

774
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,490
Someone called for Santa?

775
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,961
Ho, ho, ho.

776
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,048
Dan, you're watching the kids.

777
00:52:56,600 --> 00:53:00,924
<i>Jody was nervous
about what she might find at the cabin,</i>

778
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,684
<i>but she was comforted by the fact</i>

779
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:06,287
<i>that Caesar and the girls
were in good hands.</i>

780
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,521
Who do you work for?

781
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,763
Kendra, this isn't
the cabin I was talking about.

782
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,924
I know, ljust
thought you needed to relax.

783
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,127
Take one of these.

784
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:48,611
Um, I don't know.

785
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,570
Oh, come on, they'll only last
a couple of hours, tops.

786
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,883
Kendra, I don't need drugs to have fun.

787
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,321
Let me take a picture.

788
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,641
Oh, that's so hot!

789
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,490
Yeah!

790
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:07,731
Yeah, ride it, yeah, yeah!

791
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:24,765
A dollar will make me holler,
honey boo boo child.

792
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:12,167
Sorry.

793
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:27,642
I don't always go downtown,

794
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:31,765
but when I do,
I drink a beer first.

795
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:35,686
I'm the king of the world!
Woo! Woo!

796
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:39,011
I'm wicked hard!

797
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:43,806
Mind if I play through?

798
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,686
Ooh, shit!

799
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,923
Again? You son of a bitch,
I'm gonna kill you!

800
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,922
Oh, my God,
rehearsal. I'm late.

801
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:34,769
Oh, no, oh, my God, oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

802
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,848
- Stop, stop!
- Oh, Jody, thank God you're here, girl.

803
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,411
I was just dancing and kissing him

804
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:57,005
'cause I didn't want him
to think about you being late.

805
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,401
Well, I'm the dancer, so I'll do
the kissing around here.

806
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,210
That was amazing.

807
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,440
I want you to have my children.

808
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,967
But, Papa, please,
we want to stay with you.

809
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:10,407
- Back in the car, Gaston.
- Aw...

810
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,244
She can't make you forget about me.

811
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,482
I overslept because you
just took off this morning.

812
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,210
- This morning?
- Yeah, you slept over.

813
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:19,091
What? Wait a minute, did you have
some kind of lezzo dream fantasy

814
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,242
- about me?
- Don't act like you weren't there.

815
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:24,244
We had something special.
We made love last night for hours.

816
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,164
- What?
- Oh, and now you're gonna tell me.

817
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,921
Tiger Woods didn't
come out of my vagina?

818
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,449
Jody.

819
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,489
What?!

820
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,808
Oh, yeah, yeah.

821
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,167
Well, that explains the poison ivy.

822
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,731
Jody?

823
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:45,047
- There you are.
- Kendra?

824
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,850
Oh, the door was open
so I let myself in.

825
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,685
It's OK. Look, I'm so sorry.

826
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:52,366
I really believed something happened
between us last night.

827
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,683
- I must have dreamt the whole thing.
- Oh, no, we had sex.

828
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,480
But this morning at rehearsal,
you said...

829
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,400
I can't have the whole cast
knowing my business.

830
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,010
I'm already doing half of 'em,

831
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,043
and besides, me and Pierre...
we have this little thing...

832
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,406
Wait, then, what's this?

833
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,600
Beats me... must have
happened after I left.

834
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:11,042
- Oh, yeah!
- Girl, you are freaky.

835
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,609
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

836
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,962
<i>Oh, yeah, get it. Oh, my God.</i>

837
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,209
Oh, shit!

838
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:24,204
See, I knew she was real.

839
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,482
All right, let's find out
where this cabin is.

840
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,649
Ugh!

841
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,680
What in the hell?

842
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:51,002
Bad girl.

843
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,481
Oh, what is this?

844
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:57,201
Oh, my God, it's the same
cabin from the dream. Of course.

845
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,561
So, what are we gonna do
if we find that book?

846
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:03,331
I don't know, if that's the book
that turned Mama into what she is,

847
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,051
maybe it could
somehow reverse the curse.

848
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:07,690
OK, we're almost there.

849
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,163
- Hey, I'm not going in there.
- We have to go inside.

850
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:15,569
The book is the key
to the nightmare I'm living.

851
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:19,281
- Oh, my gosh, who are you?
- I'm Jody and this is Kendra.

852
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,204
We're looking for something
very important.

853
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,601
We all are. Come on in.

854
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:32,083
<i>J' Go tell it on the mountain.</i>

855
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:36,404
<i>J' Over the hills and everywhere
Go...</i>

856
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:39,086
Everybody, this is Jody and Kendra.

857
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,004
- Hello, Jody and Kendra.
- Hi.

858
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,400
Pardon me for not standing,

859
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:45,120
but I'm mending the wing of this bird
that we found in the woods.

860
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,971
OK. Hi, we're in a hurry.

861
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,884
We're actually looking for
a book that could save lives.

862
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:52,407
- Yes, I've got it right here.
- Oh, thank God.

863
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:56,724
Thank him indeed. The Bible.
Here, let me read to you.

864
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,611
Oh, no, no, see,
we're actually looking for...

865
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,606
- ...the book of evil.
- I know evil all too well.

866
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,649
- You do?
- This weekend's devoted to Mia.

867
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,086
It's a detox weekend.

868
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,727
She's hooked on energy shots.

869
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,484
Oh, yeah, that's a real struggle.

870
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,324
OK, listen,
we're looking for another book

871
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,165
- somewhere in this cabin.
- Hm. We haven't seen anything.

872
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:19,004
We gave it a shot,
let's get out of here.

873
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:21,003
OK, wait.

874
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:24,243
- Is there a cellar?
- Great.

875
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,082
- There it is.
- Oh!

876
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,051
OK, I don't care what it says.

877
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,289
"The curse begins with four words.

878
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:55,808
Gort Klaatu Barada Nikto."

879
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,051
You're all going to die tonight.

880
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,049
You're all going to die tonight.

881
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:30,090
"The curse ends with one word.

882
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:31,844
Adunda."

883
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,811
What the heck?

884
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,447
- Why?
- I don't have an arm.

885
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:43,411
For some reason
I cut my tongue in half.

886
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:47,007
OK, well, let's at least finish
the song. Everyone hold hands.

887
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:50,403
- Except for Eric.
- Damn.

888
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:54,650
<i>J' Go tell it on the mountain.</i>

889
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:58,964
<i>J' Over the hills and everywhere.</i>

890
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:01,600
Well, maybe we didn't do it right.

891
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,525
"Gort Klaatu Barada Nikto."

892
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,328
"Adunda."

893
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:22,131
Why does this keep happening?
Where's my arm?

894
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,760
- Is this yours?
- That's a left.

895
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:26,445
That's mine.
Could you hand it to me, please?

896
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:29,126
- I need a right.
- Eric chainsawed it off.

897
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,567
- Look, I'm sorry.
- My... My leg?

898
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:34,087
No, that's black. It's not mine.

899
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:36,846
- Oh, shit.
- I don't know what I'm gonna do.

900
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,844
Oh, cry me a river.

901
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,320
I'm gonna need a little help.
I have to go to the bathroom.

902
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:46,961
- My penis is in the corner.
- This is fucked up.

903
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:48,645
Let me try.

904
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:55,327
"Gort Klaatu Barada Nikto."

905
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:59,201
Nothing again.

906
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,290
- You know what? Let's go.
- Wait, there's a door right here.

907
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:05,771
Let's go out this way.

908
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:08,366
OK, cool, we can avoid
the weirdos upstairs.

909
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:12,002
<i>J' We're gonna get you.</i>

910
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,970
<i>J' Not another peep.</i>

911
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:22,928
Gort Klaatu Barada Nikto.
Gort Klaatu Barada Nikto.

912
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:25,641
<i>Kendra and I recited
the Latin words over and over</i>

913
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,882
at the cabin and on the way home.

914
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:30,850
We must have said it a hundred times,
but nothing happened.

915
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,280
What if it isn't the right book?

916
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:34,681
Maybe the curse
has somehow been lifted.

917
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:40,048
<i>Luckily for Dan and Jody,
there was someone in the house</i>

918
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,521
<i>who, thanks to the I-13 formula,</i>

919
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:46,480
<i>had increased intelligence
and superior cognitive ability.</i>

920
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:49,211
<i>His analytical problem-solving skills
allowed him...</i>

921
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:52,170
<i>to ascertain crucial information.</i>

922
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:57,281
<i>A marvel of modern-da y science,
his IQ had surpassed even the most...</i>

923
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:58,726
<i>AW, hell.</i>

924
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,569
Why did I think
you could be intelligent?

925
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,762
You're nothing but a dumb animal.

926
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,285
0w!

927
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,249
Idiot!

928
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:41,921
- I can talk.
- Hey, Caesar.

929
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:46,604
Steve?

930
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:48,444
Dan's got a mad demon in his house.

931
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:52,329
- Matt Damon's in his house?
- No, a mad demon.

932
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:56,565
I love Matt Damon. Jason Bourne.

933
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:57,926
<i>OY-</i>

934
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:03,729
I should have known not to bring
a wild animal into the house.

935
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,524
I'm... I'm so sorry.

936
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,760
But I believed in Caesar.
I thought he was different.

937
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:09,120
There's something more to this.

938
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:12,528
- I can feel it.
- No, he just... went crazy.

939
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:16,042
Forget it. But I still think Mama
could be in this house.

940
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:17,964
- But don't you...
- We just had a whole night go on

941
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:21,886
- without a single sign of anything.
- I guess.

942
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,803
I was just so scared
last night for the kids.

943
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,450
You're coming around.

944
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,447
<i>Am I getting attached to them?</i>

945
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:14,444
It's the cliff from the dream.

946
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:17,930
Get in the car now.
Don't make me yell!

947
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:20,686
Unto thee, Satan,
I sacrifice these children.

948
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:23,286
Return home to the cliff of...
Holy shit!

949
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:27,766
Home is at the cliff.
Oh, my God. Girls!

950
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:32,167
Kathy. It's OK. I saw the cliff.
I know what "home" means.

951
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,129
Whoa!

952
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:48,565
Come on, girls. Let's go get Aidan.

953
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,563
That's cool.

954
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:53,087
Lily! Come on.

955
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,849
Aidan! Are you OK?

956
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:07,529
Uncle Dan! Uncle Dan!

957
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:09,170
Mama! Mama! Mama!

958
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:10,446
She's here!

959
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,524
Whoa. Girls, girls, girls.
One at a time. Lily, you first.

960
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,086
Got it. Now Kathy.

961
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,686
Mama! Mama! She's here!
She's gonna kill us!

962
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:23,241
How many times do I have to tell
everyone there's no such thing as...

963
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:25,050
_

964
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,406
Ow!

965
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:11,724
Maria? What are you doing here?

966
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:14,724
I was angry you fire me,
so I bake you this.

967
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:19,163
A shit pie?

968
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:22,443
- Uh, thanks, but...
- Hot dog?

969
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:27,329
No, that's still shit with mustard.

970
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:31,724
Maybe just a banana, then?
Very much potassium.

971
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:34,446
So bueno, Mr. Dan.

972
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,887
No, I... I'm sorry.
I should have listened to you...

973
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:41,443
Mr. Dan, we have our problems,
but I always love you.

974
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,045
So much.

975
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:51,365
When I see you, I see my father.

976
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,245
Dan. Dan, we have to...

977
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:59,409
- Wait. What's going on here?
- I can explain.

978
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:02,800
There's no time. Mama has the girls.
I know where she took them.

979
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,289
Got to go.

980
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:06,930
You remind me of my father.

981
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,849
Dan!

982
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,649
<i>Knowing the girls
were in danger,</i>

983
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:17,043
<i>Dan and Jody sped off,
racing to get to the cliff they...</i>

984
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:19,407
<i>Oh, my God. What happened to the car?</i>

985
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:21,005
<i>Where...? Oh, there it is.</i>

986
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:25,449
<i>They were no longer able to sit idly by
and let</i> a <i>ghost jump off</i> a <i>cliff,</i>

987
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:27,210
- <i>sacrificing their children with her.</i>
<i>- Kathy! Lily!</i>

988
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:30,045
Oh, my God. There they are.
Kathy, Lily, stop!

989
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,008
- What do we do now?
- Um, l'lljust...

990
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:37,001
read from this
and change her back to human.

991
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:48,166
Girls, run! Run! No.

992
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:49,890
No, not that way. Away from the cliff!

993
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:53,566
I'm not going to let Mama
take you away again.

994
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:55,961
<i>'</i> - Hm?

995
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:04,051
Lily, stop! Come on.
Come on. Here, girl. Come on, Lily.

996
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:09,086
Come on. Look. Oh, look. Yeah.

997
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:18,406
Come on. Look. Oh, yeah. Lily.

998
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:21,450
Oh, wow. Yeah.

999
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:23,880
Oh, come on.

1000
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:27,730
Enough! This is crazy.

1001
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:30,486
Lily's not a dog.

1002
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:33,120
She's a beautiful little girl
who I've grown to love.

1003
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:36,727
I love all these children, Mama,
even if they don't all love me.

1004
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:41,130
Lily loves you, too, Jody.

1005
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:42,850
And they belong in this world
with me and Dan.

1006
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,606
Because they deserve parents
who aren't decomposing.

1007
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,165
Good girl.

1008
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:51,449
All right, enough.

1009
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,562
Where's the page?
Damn it, I can't find it.

1010
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:56,165
Forget it.

1011
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:58,322
There, that worked. Maybe not.

1012
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:19,920
Man, we need to stop smoking this shit.

1013
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,207
Told you that shark
was going to come in handy.

1014
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:28,601
Thank you. Lily.

1015
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:31,482
Honey, thank God you're all right.

1016
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:47,004
- Your cue is coming up.
- Oh, Kendra.

1017
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:52,001
Look, it's OK, girl.
Let's forget about what happened.

1018
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:56,364
- You are the Black Swan.
- No. It's you.

1019
01:11:56,520 --> 01:12:00,445
Throwing Mama off the cliff has really
made me reevaluate my priorities.

1020
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:03,729
My family comes first.
You dance the Black Swan.

1021
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:07,440
Because sometimes in life...

1022
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:13,808
<i>Introducing our new Swan Queen,
Miss Kendra Brooks.</i>

1023
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:38,803
- This is not ballet.
- No, it the hell ain't.

1024
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:42,409
This some bullshit.

1025
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:54,164
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1026
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:57,244
That's what I'm talking about!
Right? Right?

1027
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:58,811
You know that shit, right?

1028
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:01,964
<i>And so our story ends.</i>

1029
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:04,282
<i>If anything is to be learned from this,</i>

1030
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:07,450
<i>it's that mankind is</i> a <i>pathetic race</i>

1031
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,968
<i>and apes need to take over this planet.</i>

1032
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:14,602
<i>Enjoy Earth while you still got it.</i>

1033
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:01,086
Well, we'll see how you like it
once the swan consumes you!

1034
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:25,729
I cannot hold it that long.
It's, like... it's so long.

1035
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:58,404
We're kissing.

1036
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:05,402
<i>['</i> Uaughing] - Cut! Cut!

1037
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:08,565
Cut! _.

1038
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:13,321
We're kissing.

1039
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:35,683
Cut!

1040
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:51,486
- What happened?
- Guy was in the shot.

1041
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:54,166
- Ah.
- Cut!

1042
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:55,646
But was he dressed like a demon?

1043
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:00,524
Do the second "my penis"
as a question.

1044
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:02,762
OK. And then "my other penis"
is a question also?

1045
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:04,126
Yeah.

1046
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:06,203
But remember, you're jumping
to "What the hell is that?"

1047
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:08,442
- I know. I don't know why.
- You're jumping... Yeah.

1048
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:10,329
There's just so many penises.

1049
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,881
Welcome to Hollywood.

1050
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:18,287
- I'm ready for it.
- Hey.

1051
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:19,965
I'm OK with this.

1052
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:23,044
That's the temporary nurses' shower.

1053
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:25,123
- And we're painting it.
- Cut.

1054
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:28,284
That's the... temporary nurses' shower.

1055
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,090
I'm OK with this.

1056
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,969
Sorry, you guys. I...

1057
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:40,811
I'm OK with this.

1058
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:44,407
That's the nurses'
temporary locker room,

1059
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,210
and we're repainting it.

1060
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:49,166
[' Uaughing] - Cut.

1061
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:59,289
Ouch. Hello here!

1062
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:03,481
B mark!

1063
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:05,569
- And background.
- Action!

1064
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:10,169
Oh!

1065
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:18,769
Jody! Thank God I caught you.

1066
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:22,564
I forgot to tell you, now that
you are the Swan Queen...

1067
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:27,851
Suck my...

1068
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:32,602
I'll save you, Snoop Dogg.

1069
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:35,923
My name ain't Snoop Dogg
in this... movie, man!

1070
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:43,367
- Well, I mean, I...
- Sh...

1071
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:54,521
Stop it!

1072
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:56,569
We're good. We're good.

1073
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:02,889
Now prepare for a night
of unparalleled passion.

1074
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:05,725
- Oh, wait, wait, Mr. Grey...
- The safe word is "deeper."

1075
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:06,881
What?

1076
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:15,081
Damn! Ow!

1077
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:16,571
Whoa!

1078
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:22,489
What does all this
have to do with the ballet?

1079
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:26,167
- Ballet?
- Yes. Aren't you donating millions?

1080
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:28,084
Millions? What...? I'm broke.

1081
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:30,242
Every cent I have
has been put into this room.

1082
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:37,280
I don't know what I'm going to do.

1083
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:40,006
Oh, cry me a river.

1084
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:44,609
I'm going to need a little help.
I don't have a penis.

1085
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:04,365
It does not come off.

1086
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:06,568
It does not come off. I'm sorry.

1087
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:11,643
I'm getting tired of talking
about this...

1088
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:13,768
In the woods with this man.

1089
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:17,481
Man, we keep going in
circles, talking about a... man.

1090
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:18,971
Let's talk about a... man,

1091
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:20,804
- or getting some...
- Getting some...

1092
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,962
Talking about...
these two dudes in the woods.

1093
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:27,250
If we had a... here, she could
wash our... off right now.

1094
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:29,880
You understand me?
That's the way I would say it.

1095
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,764
Hey, babe, check out
this psychic's book for a clue.

1096
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:37,685
- It really freaks me out.
- Come on, there's nothing to be...

1097
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,604
Nun!

1098
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:42,491
These books are all...

1099
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:45,211
There's nothing to be scared...

1100
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:53,483
to be scared...

1101
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,200
Oh, there's nothing to be scared...

1102
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:58,089
Oh, wrong animal.

1103
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:02,643
Be scared... A dinosaur?

1104
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:08,808
What does this have to do with...?

1105
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:14,207
I know. Sorry.

1106
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:18,088
And... action!

1107
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:21,847
- What does this have to do with...?
- Sorry.

1108
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:29,320
You just keep cupping your boobs.
OK, sorry.

1109
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:49,482
OK, how do we know who's a witch?

1110
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,242
Do they have a broom?

1111
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:55,811
Do they have a pointy nose?

1112
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:06,285
I'm... I'm going to pee my pants!

1113
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,365
So, what, I didn't get the part?

1114
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,409
Where's everybody going?

1115
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:29,321
I just had the most bizarro dream.

1116
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:31,687
Demons, apes, a ballet.

1117
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:34,127
You have a very active subconscious.

1118
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:36,521
Anyway, the idea took hold.

1119
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:39,570
Lindsay Lohan's coming over
to spend the night with you.

1120
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:41,563
Awesome!

1121
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:49,920
You were driving.
