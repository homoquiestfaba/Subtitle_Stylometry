[man]
Hey, Mr. Delaney, delivery.

18
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:24,258
Hey, Bobby.
Where's your old man?

19
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:27,913
He'll...
I mean I'll be right down.

20
00:01:27,957 --> 00:01:29,393
He and Mom
are getting ready to leave.

21
00:01:29,437 --> 00:01:31,178
-I'm in charge.
-You?

22
00:01:31,961 --> 00:01:34,181
I'll be right down, Doug.
Ow!

23
00:01:35,443 --> 00:01:36,661
Dad?

24
00:01:37,401 --> 00:01:40,143
-There's a delivery downstairs.-It can wait.

25
00:01:40,187 --> 00:01:43,799
Now, if you use the oven,
make sure you turn it off.

26
00:01:44,234 --> 00:01:45,931
And your mother's plants,

27
00:01:45,975 --> 00:01:48,412
they need their feeding
every three days.

28
00:01:48,456 --> 00:01:50,762
-You'll only be gone a week.
-[mom] Which means

29
00:01:50,806 --> 00:01:54,114
you'll need to water them twice,dear. Once on Tuesday evening

30
00:01:54,157 --> 00:01:55,463
and then again
on Friday morning.

31
00:01:55,724 --> 00:01:58,205
I know.
I know when to water them.

32
00:01:58,466 --> 00:02:00,990
It's on the list you gave me,
and the list Dad gave me.

33
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:02,296
And it's probably written across

34
00:02:02,339 --> 00:02:03,775
the bathroom mirror
in a secret code,

35
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:05,647
which I'll spend one week
trying to figure out,

36
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,170
and it'll only say,
"Water the plants."

37
00:02:07,214 --> 00:02:09,433
Are you through, dear?We're in a very much of a hurry.

38
00:02:09,477 --> 00:02:12,958
-Yes. I'll get a cab.
-[dad] This is the first time

39
00:02:13,002 --> 00:02:14,699
we've left you in charge, Bobby.

40
00:02:14,743 --> 00:02:16,484
[mom] We just wanna leave you
with enough instructions

41
00:02:16,527 --> 00:02:17,963
to cover any emergency.

42
00:02:18,007 --> 00:02:20,836
I'll call you at the conventionif there's any problems.

43
00:02:22,011 --> 00:02:23,273
Don't worry.

44
00:02:23,317 --> 00:02:25,667
Joan and I
can handle everything.

45
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,626
Remember, empty the registereach night and make the deposits

46
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,280
-the next morning in--
-In person.

47
00:02:30,324 --> 00:02:31,716
Don't use the deposit machines.

48
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,327
-What's this?
-Uh, nothing.

49
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,285
Uh, come on.
You got to hurry.

50
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:37,505
[Doug] If someone
ain't out here in ten seconds,

51
00:02:37,548 --> 00:02:39,811
-I'm leaving this crate...
-He'll leave it there anyway.

52
00:02:39,855 --> 00:02:42,466
Well, if you'd be nicer,maybe he'd help you bring it in.

53
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,207
-I am nice. He's the jerk.-[Doug]
One, two, three, four...

54
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:46,166
Remember, have Joan
clean all this junk.

55
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:47,819
Come on,
you'll be late for your bus.

56
00:02:47,863 --> 00:02:49,473
Honey, he's fine.
We better hurry.

57
00:02:49,517 --> 00:02:51,649
It's the first vacation
we've had in a while.

58
00:02:51,693 --> 00:02:53,564
-You're not chickening out now.-[Doug] ...seven, eight, nine...

59
00:02:53,608 --> 00:02:55,827
-Good thing you got here, kid.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

60
00:02:55,871 --> 00:02:58,178
Taxi! Taxi!

61
00:02:59,614 --> 00:03:01,311
The taxi awaits.

62
00:03:01,355 --> 00:03:03,661
Will someone sign this
so I can split?

63
00:03:03,705 --> 00:03:05,185
Bobby will. He's in charge.

64
00:03:06,098 --> 00:03:08,231
Now, make sure you eat, dear.

65
00:03:08,275 --> 00:03:10,973
-Tell Joanie to make you eat.
-Yes, Mom.

66
00:03:19,373 --> 00:03:22,289
Yeah! [laughs]
Woo!

67
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,292
-Which line?
-Right here, pal. Calm down.

68
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,512
-Wow.
-[Doug] Hey!

69
00:03:28,556 --> 00:03:30,079
How about you two
sitting on my face?

70
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:31,123
Shh.

71
00:03:33,822 --> 00:03:35,345
-Pig!
-Ow!

72
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:36,564
[Doug] Oink, oink, oink.

73
00:03:37,652 --> 00:03:39,088
Thanks a lot.

74
00:03:39,915 --> 00:03:41,003
See you later, kid.

75
00:03:42,396 --> 00:03:44,615
-Good luck being in charge.
-Aren't you gonna help?

76
00:03:45,486 --> 00:03:47,705
-Hey, you need some help?
-[Bobby] Joan.

77
00:03:47,749 --> 00:03:49,098
Yeah. I sure do.

78
00:03:49,316 --> 00:03:51,274
-Did your parents leave?
-You missed them by minutes.

79
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:52,971
Did they leave you any lists?

80
00:03:53,015 --> 00:03:54,538
-Ha ha ha ha.
-Sorry I asked.

81
00:03:54,582 --> 00:03:56,148
[grunts]

82
00:03:59,587 --> 00:04:01,371
So, what your dad
order from Egypt?

83
00:04:01,415 --> 00:04:03,243
Probably a crate full of junk.

84
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:05,375
Did you set up this morning,
Bobby?

85
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:08,248
Dad did. He was up at 6:00 a.m.setting up.

86
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,380
I've only been working heresince I was old enough to walk,

87
00:04:10,424 --> 00:04:12,556
and he still doesn't think
I can set up.

88
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,905
Coffee?

89
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:16,256
Yeah, but only
if Stella's delivering.

90
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:20,608
Let's see
what Dad got this time.

91
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:21,261
[crate creaks]

92
00:04:23,132 --> 00:04:25,265
Hi. This is Joan
over at Delaney's.

93
00:04:26,614 --> 00:04:28,964
Yes. Good morning
to you too, Stella.

94
00:04:29,704 --> 00:04:32,272
The usual.
Thank you.

95
00:04:34,622 --> 00:04:35,666
Well?

96
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:38,408
Everything is broken.
Wait till I get a hold

97
00:04:38,452 --> 00:04:40,323
-of that guy.
-Calm down.

98
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:41,803
I think it's supposed to be
that way.

99
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:44,284
Yeah.
These are Egyptian artifacts.

100
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:46,286
You're kidding?
They must be worth of fortune.

101
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:48,331
Antiquities need to be
in one piece to be valuable.

102
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,941
Is that whatthey're teaching you in college?

103
00:04:49,985 --> 00:04:51,682
It's my field, Bobby.

104
00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:54,119
Looks like your dad got a greatdeal on a crate full of--

105
00:04:54,163 --> 00:04:55,730
-Crap?
-[Joan] Yeah.

106
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:05,217
Wow.

107
00:05:06,393 --> 00:05:08,308
It's beautiful.

108
00:05:15,706 --> 00:05:18,013
They must have put it in
by mistake.

109
00:05:18,448 --> 00:05:22,365
Bobby, this is the real thing.
This is a perfect specimen.

110
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:26,761
Gee, that's real pretty.
How much you want for it?

111
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,676
Stella, we haven't
priced this yet.

112
00:05:29,677 --> 00:05:30,721
Stupid me.

113
00:05:30,765 --> 00:05:32,462
Now that you know
I wanna buy it,

114
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:34,464
you'll probably
charge me double.

115
00:05:34,508 --> 00:05:37,119
Oh, I would never
do that to you, Stella.

116
00:05:37,598 --> 00:05:39,034
Never double.

117
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:40,731
That's sweet.

118
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:43,560
Here's your coffees.
Now, that's $1.10.

119
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:47,869
-Your folks around here, Bobby?-Uh, they left 15 minutes ago.

120
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:50,959
You gonna throw a party
while they're gone?

121
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,439
Uh, I don't know.

122
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,485
Uh, maybe you'd liketo come over for dinner tonight

123
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:57,531
and help plan something
like a party.

124
00:05:58,053 --> 00:06:00,882
Sure.
I love parties.

125
00:06:02,144 --> 00:06:04,581
Joan can come.
I can come.

126
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,367
You can come.
Oh.

127
00:06:07,715 --> 00:06:10,239
-How's 6:00?
-Six what?

128
00:06:10,282 --> 00:06:12,546
Tonight at 6:00?
Meet me here.

129
00:06:12,894 --> 00:06:16,027
Oh. Oh.
Yeah. Sure.

130
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:21,598
Oh, and I want that bottle.
It'll look great on my toilet.

131
00:06:22,077 --> 00:06:24,079
-See you.
-[Bobby] See you.

132
00:06:24,775 --> 00:06:25,776
[door closes]

133
00:06:26,516 --> 00:06:30,172
Stella is coming over
for dinner tonight.

134
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:36,004
This is the greatest!
The greatest! [laughs]

135
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:38,876
Yeah. So I heard. So let's
finish unpacking this crate.

136
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,226
-Okey-dokey, boss.
-Do you see anything

137
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,706
on that slip about this bottle?

138
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,447
No. This is the last thing
on the list.

139
00:06:44,491 --> 00:06:45,883
There must be a mistake.

140
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:47,885
[Joan] I can't find anything
about it in my book.

141
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:49,539
You just so happened
to have a book

142
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,236
about Egyptian antiquities?

143
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,544
No. Bottles. The kind
that date back before Christ.

144
00:06:54,588 --> 00:06:56,633
You know,
all the undamaged specimens

145
00:06:56,677 --> 00:06:59,810
were found in burial places
like, uh, pyramids and tombs.

146
00:06:59,854 --> 00:07:02,944
Bobby, this is really weird,
this could be worth a fortune.

147
00:07:02,987 --> 00:07:04,424
Well, what's your book say?

148
00:07:04,772 --> 00:07:06,600
I don't know anything
about hieroglyphics.

149
00:07:07,122 --> 00:07:08,297
I'll call the company.

150
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:10,125
You know, Professor Foley
might know.

151
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:11,474
Who's that?

152
00:07:11,518 --> 00:07:12,606
He's my language teacher.

153
00:07:13,824 --> 00:07:16,784
Hi. This is Bobby
calling from Delaney Antiques.

154
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,135
Uh, yes. We got it.
That's why I'm calling. Uh...

155
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:23,443
No, no, no. I realize everythingis supposed to be broken,

156
00:07:23,486 --> 00:07:24,879
but there's an extra bottle

157
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,011
that's not on this list
that you sent us.

158
00:07:29,492 --> 00:07:31,973
No. No. I'm not complaining.
Uh, I just thought someone

159
00:07:32,016 --> 00:07:33,322
made an error or...

160
00:07:34,802 --> 00:07:37,369
You packed the box yourself
and there was no bottle?

161
00:07:38,632 --> 00:07:40,547
Well, maybe someone else
in the company may--

162
00:07:41,809 --> 00:07:44,072
Okay. Okay.
Listen I was just trying to...

163

-He hung up.
-[hangs up phone]

164
00:07:49,643 --> 00:07:50,992
Oh, well. Let's open.

166
00:07:58,347 --> 00:08:00,175
-Bobby, Stella's here.
-Where?

167
00:08:01,219 --> 00:08:02,830
Nowhere. I just wanted
to get your attention.

168
00:08:02,873 --> 00:08:03,874

00:08:50,312 --> 00:08:53,750
One for Bobby.
One for Stella. [chuckles]

174
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:07,068
And now the couple retires
to an evening of romance.

175
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:09,549
Let's see.

176
00:09:10,332 --> 00:09:13,117
That's good. Candles.

177
00:09:14,902 --> 00:09:17,426
Candles.
Plates, silverware, napkins.

178
00:09:17,469 --> 00:09:19,646
Wine glasses.
The wine glasses.

179
00:09:20,951 --> 00:09:24,259
Oh, Stella. Stella, this will bea night to remember.

180
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:27,697
Ow!

181
00:09:27,741 --> 00:09:28,568
[cash register dings]

182
00:09:30,352 --> 00:09:31,440
Here's your change.

183
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:33,790
-Ma'am, your change.
-What? Oh.

184
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:36,924
-How much is that bottle?
-It's already sold.

185
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:40,928
Oh. Well, it's beautiful.
Something hypnotic about it.

186
00:09:41,668 --> 00:09:42,625
Thanks.

187
00:09:43,931 --> 00:09:46,716
-To whom is it sold?
-To Stella.

188
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,413
She wants it for her toilet.

189
00:09:48,457 --> 00:09:49,937
Don't you dare give that to her

190
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,287
until after I've spoke
to Professor Foley.

191
00:09:52,983 --> 00:09:55,638
I have a feeling this is not
a piece of toilet decor.

192
00:09:55,682 --> 00:09:57,466
Okay. Okay. It's 6:00.

193
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:58,598
You're gonna be late
for your class.

194
00:09:58,946 --> 00:10:01,775
You're so considerate.
Give Stella my best.

195
00:10:02,993 --> 00:10:05,169
And don't you give that
to that waitress.

196
00:10:05,517 --> 00:10:07,128
Okey-dokey, boss.

[whistles]

199
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:26,713
6:30? Yeah.
She'll be here any minute.

200
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:31,152
[exhales] I bet Stella
looks just like that.

201

[sighs]

202
00:10:36,331 --> 00:10:39,813
It's quarter after seven.
Where is she?

[groans]

204

[Stella giggling]

205
00:11:03,575 --> 00:11:06,666
That will be all for today.
Class dismissed.

[students chattering]

207
00:11:10,104 --> 00:11:12,672
-Professor Foley?
-Yes, Ms. Peabody.

208
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:16,153
I, um... I came across thisbottle in the shop where I work.

209
00:11:16,197 --> 00:11:17,633
Oh, that's nice.

210
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,070
Now, if you'll excuse me, dear,I've got things to do.

211
00:11:20,114 --> 00:11:22,769
Look, it had this writing on it.It looks like hieroglyphics.

212
00:11:25,032 --> 00:11:27,208
Is-- Is this all the writing
on the bottle?

213
00:11:27,556 --> 00:11:29,993
Oh, no. There was a lot more.
I just couldn't make it up.

214
00:11:30,037 --> 00:11:32,517
[Prof. Foley] Is there anychance I could see this bottle?

215
00:11:32,561 --> 00:11:34,084
-Oh, of course. When?
-Now!

216
00:11:34,998 --> 00:11:37,479
Well, I can't now,
but we open the shop at 9:00.

217
00:11:38,349 --> 00:11:40,047
Professor Foley,
can you tell me what it says?

218
00:11:40,395 --> 00:11:42,223
Uh, nothing. Nothing.

219
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:45,313
I'll need to see the rest
of the hieroglyphics

220
00:11:45,574 --> 00:11:47,228
before I know what it all means.

221
00:11:47,576 --> 00:11:50,100
I'll keep it,
if you don't mind.

222
00:11:50,797 --> 00:11:51,885
No, of course not.

223
00:11:52,624 --> 00:11:54,496
I'll see you tomorrow.
Good night.

224
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:56,063
[Prof. Foley] Good night.

225
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,635
Foley. Foley...

226
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:06,160
this may finally be it.

227
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:31,272
Joan?

228
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,841
Stella?

229
00:12:35,624 --> 00:12:36,756
Is somebody here?

230
00:12:38,932 --> 00:12:41,630
Oh, no! The chicken!

231
00:12:43,197 --> 00:12:46,940
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, shit!

232
00:12:49,116 --> 00:12:51,988
Ow! Ow!
[groans]

233
00:12:53,468 --> 00:12:55,775
-Oh, water. Water.

-Oh. Oh, much better.

235
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,129
Oh. Oh. Oh.

236
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:06,002
God, I'm gonna get killed.

237
00:13:07,003 --> 00:13:09,484
[sobbing] I should've never
invited Stella over.

238
00:13:10,877 --> 00:13:13,314
I wish this place
was back to normal.

239
00:13:13,705 --> 00:13:15,403
[coughs]

240
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:19,842
Wish number one?

241
00:13:20,364 --> 00:13:21,844
You got it, Master.

242
00:13:23,672 --> 00:13:24,673
[clicks fingers]

243
00:13:33,508 --> 00:13:36,728
[sighs]Not bad after 2,000 years, huh?

244
00:13:37,425 --> 00:13:38,948
Oh, your bird's over in that...

245
00:13:38,992 --> 00:13:40,820
-That thing.
-The refrigerator?

246
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,561
That's a refrigerator?

247
00:13:43,605 --> 00:13:45,128
You know, I've always
heard about them,

248
00:13:45,172 --> 00:13:47,130
but I've never really seen one.

249
00:13:47,174 --> 00:13:50,003
I could use one to keep
my beer cold in that bottle.

250
00:13:50,612 --> 00:13:51,918
What's the matter with you?

251
00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:53,833
You look like you've seen
Caesar's ghost.

252
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:55,225
I don't look that bad.

253
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,967
And besides, look at you,
you're no Mark Anthony either.

254
00:13:58,011 --> 00:13:59,708
Who are you?
How did you do that?

255
00:14:00,448 --> 00:14:01,841
The name's Dancee.

256
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:03,712
And everything
is back to normal,

257
00:14:04,147 --> 00:14:06,236
if you call this normal,
because you wished it.

258
00:14:06,715 --> 00:14:07,977
What?

259
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:09,979
[Dancee] Now, you've used up
one wish, Master.

260
00:14:10,023 --> 00:14:12,242
And if you could please
get a move on with this.

261
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:15,506
I've got over 2,000 years
of partying to catch up on to

262
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,856
and time is wasting.

263
00:14:19,728 --> 00:14:20,990
Hey, wait up, Master.

264
00:14:21,034 --> 00:14:22,731
I didn't mean that
about Mark Anthony.

265
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:24,951
Oh, he was a schmuck anyway.

266
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:27,867
[clicks fingers]

267
00:14:32,219 --> 00:14:34,177
-Oh. Oh. How--
-How many wishes

268
00:14:34,221 --> 00:14:36,919
do you have left? Two.
And who's this girl here?

269
00:14:36,963 --> 00:14:38,921
Some kind of sacred goddess
or something?

270
00:14:38,965 --> 00:14:40,923
Who are you?
What do you want from me?

271
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:43,447
Calm down. That's how
I ended up in the bottle

272
00:14:43,491 --> 00:14:45,667
in the first place.
And I would really rather

273
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,930
not end up in there again.
You know what I mean?

274
00:14:47,974 --> 00:14:49,714
-Miss...
-[Dancee] Dancee.

275
00:14:49,758 --> 00:14:52,892
Dancee. I don't understand
a thing you're saying.

276
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:55,590
Oh, okay. I see.Let me give it to you straight.

277
00:14:55,764 --> 00:14:58,071
I'm a genie put in the bottle
because I got caught

278
00:14:58,114 --> 00:15:00,290
doing something
I wasn't supposed to be doing.

279
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:02,075
Oh, but sure had fun doing it.

280
00:15:02,336 --> 00:15:03,293
A genie?

281
00:15:03,598 --> 00:15:05,339
Yeah. Your garden variety type.

282
00:15:05,687 --> 00:15:07,341
You get three wishes,
I grant them.

283
00:15:07,994 --> 00:15:10,083
You release me.
You're happy. I'm happy.

284
00:15:10,605 --> 00:15:11,911
You know, you're very lucky.

285
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:13,825
Most genies
have wish restrictions,

286
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:16,916
time limit guarantees,part replacements not included.

287
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,482
None of that shit with me.

288
00:15:18,526 --> 00:15:20,484
You wish, I grant,
and it's done.

289
00:15:21,137 --> 00:15:22,834
I don't believe this.

290
00:15:23,574 --> 00:15:25,620
I don't believe this.

291
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,797
You say you'll grant me a wish?

292
00:15:29,145 --> 00:15:31,104
I already have.
You've got two left.

293
00:15:31,452 --> 00:15:32,540
I got two left?

294
00:15:33,497 --> 00:15:34,629
Okay.

295
00:15:40,113 --> 00:15:41,331
Change into that.

296
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,159
Into that?

297
00:15:43,855 --> 00:15:46,946
Master, I don't mind taking
my clothes off if-- But...

298
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:48,295
Into this bikini.

299
00:15:48,338 --> 00:15:50,384
[gasps]
That's a bikini?

300
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,082
I was sitting on this thing
they called a radio

301
00:15:53,126 --> 00:15:55,476
a few years ago.
Or was it a few hundred years?

302
00:15:55,824 --> 00:15:57,957
I get so mixed up
in that bottle.

303
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,828
Anyway, they kept
singing a song

304
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:02,091
-about this itsy--
-The bikini.

305
00:16:02,135 --> 00:16:04,398
Oh, yeah. Right.
Uh, is white and pink okay?

306
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:06,748
-Sounds good.
-All right.

307
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:10,012
[clicks fingers]

308
00:16:12,058 --> 00:16:13,973
So what do you think?
I kind of like it.

309
00:16:14,364 --> 00:16:16,540
Those fucking veils
have had it anyway.

310
00:16:16,845 --> 00:16:19,282
It was time for a new wardrobe.Two thousand years

311
00:16:19,326 --> 00:16:21,632
is a long time to go
without changing your undies.

312
00:16:21,676 --> 00:16:24,157
-This is incredible.
-Incredible?

313
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,335
-Master, this body is heavenly.-Yeah. That too.

314
00:16:28,857 --> 00:16:31,381
-I got two wishes.
-Uh-uh. One wish.

315
00:16:31,773 --> 00:16:33,383
This was number two.

316
00:16:33,427 --> 00:16:35,820
And I got to thank you for it.
You're a very generous master.

317
00:16:35,864 --> 00:16:37,735
This will get me
in a lot of doors.

318
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:40,086
Now, let's tackle that
third wish.

319
00:16:40,347 --> 00:16:43,176
What is it you really want?
What you really need?

320
00:16:43,611 --> 00:16:46,353
Gosh. I can't think.
I mean, it's not every day

321
00:16:46,396 --> 00:16:48,050
a guy could have anything
he wants.

322
00:16:48,094 --> 00:16:50,357
-It is anything, isn't it?
-You name it.

323
00:16:50,705 --> 00:16:52,620
I don't know.
I don't know.

324
00:16:54,535 --> 00:16:56,667
-How about money?
-I've got to be careful.

325
00:16:56,711 --> 00:16:58,539
I've heard of people
wishing for something,

326
00:16:58,582 --> 00:16:59,844
but leaving out
part of their wish,

327
00:16:59,888 --> 00:17:01,542
and then living to regret it.

328
00:17:02,499 --> 00:17:04,588
How about fame?
Fame is anything.

329
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:07,026
[Stella giggling]

330
00:17:12,727 --> 00:17:16,426
I know what I want.Now, let me word this carefully.

331
00:17:16,948 --> 00:17:18,080
Whatever.

332
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:23,433
To be in love.
To have true love.

333
00:17:24,739 --> 00:17:27,220
-No, that's not it.
-You want sex?

334
00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:28,830
Well, that's part of it.

335
00:17:30,136 --> 00:17:31,224
But I want more.

336
00:17:32,747 --> 00:17:34,836
I wish for an honest,

337
00:17:35,967 --> 00:17:39,058
true, passionate,

338
00:17:39,841 --> 00:17:41,669
ever-expanding kind of love.

339
00:17:42,626 --> 00:17:44,454
What?
I thought you wanted sex.

340
00:17:44,498 --> 00:17:46,239
Well, that's
the passion part.

341
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,937
The kind of love
that lasts a lifetime.

342
00:17:49,503 --> 00:17:51,070
That's what I wish for.

343
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,422
I wish for the kind of lovethat will last a lifetime.

344
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,076

-Sorry. He's the boss.
-Well...

518
00:27:01,794 --> 00:27:03,622
Is there a chance I could--
I could perhaps

519
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:05,406
look at it privately?

520
00:27:06,015 --> 00:27:08,191
Well, this is about as private
as we get around here.

521
00:27:08,975 --> 00:27:09,802
Thanks.

522
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:14,807
Can you decipher it, Professor?

523
00:27:15,198 --> 00:27:17,810
Well, I'm not one to make
wild guesses, Joan.

524
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:20,508
Facts, facts, and more facts.

525
00:27:20,856 --> 00:27:23,990
That's what a true researcher
needs to back up his claims.

526
00:27:25,513 --> 00:27:27,384
Hey, Professor,
figure it all out?

527
00:27:27,428 --> 00:27:29,473
I'll need my books
for this one.

528
00:27:29,517 --> 00:27:32,433
Thank you so much for letting
me touch your bottle.

529
00:27:34,522 --> 00:27:36,829
Uh, I got a couple of errands
to run if you don't mind.

530
00:27:37,177 --> 00:27:38,221
You close.

531
00:27:38,874 --> 00:27:41,137
Master, you got to help me.
All these broads

532
00:27:41,181 --> 00:27:43,792
-are beginning to look alike.
-Your wish is my command.

533
00:27:43,836 --> 00:27:46,316
Hey, that's my line.
Who was that asshole

534
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,015
-that just came out of the shop?-Oh, that was Professor Foley.

535
00:27:49,058 --> 00:27:50,886
He was sure interested
in that bottle.

536
00:27:51,365 --> 00:27:53,672
Not to worry. I'm yours
till the wish is wished.

537
00:27:53,889 --> 00:27:56,196
He can rub that bottle
for the rest of his life

538
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:57,545
and never even get a rattle.

539
00:27:57,588 --> 00:27:59,025
What's it say
on the bottle anyway?

540
00:27:59,547 --> 00:28:01,680
Fuck if I know.
I don't read hieroglyphics.

541
00:28:02,463 --> 00:28:04,291
And, uh, what do you think
of this little outfit?

542
00:28:04,552 --> 00:28:07,598
I like it. You got to leave
something to the imagination.

543
00:28:08,512 --> 00:28:10,514
So what happens
when this wish is granted?

544
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:11,994
Where do you go?

545
00:28:12,038 --> 00:28:14,736
Once you find your true love,
you're a free spirit.

546
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,130
Oh, not in the spirit
spirit sense,

547
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:19,828
but as a woman
ready to take on the world.

548
00:28:19,872 --> 00:28:21,700
And let me tell you,
they better stand back,

549
00:28:22,048 --> 00:28:24,441
'cause Dancee is gonna
get her way this time,

550
00:28:24,485 --> 00:28:26,705
Cleopatra or no Cleopatra.

551
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:28,881
-You really knew her?
-[Dancee] Knew her?

552
00:28:28,924 --> 00:28:31,535
Master, she's the one
who had me bottled.

553
00:28:31,579 --> 00:28:33,842
Well, you know,
after she caught me with Mark,

554
00:28:33,886 --> 00:28:35,714
she had one of her mystics
put a curse on me.

555
00:28:36,497 --> 00:28:37,498
Wow.

556
00:28:38,455 --> 00:28:39,892
Hey, what are they
doing in there?

557
00:28:40,153 --> 00:28:41,415
This is a laundromat.

558
00:28:41,632 --> 00:28:42,938
It's where people go
to wash their clothes.

559
00:28:43,286 --> 00:28:44,548
Really?

560
00:28:44,592 --> 00:28:46,202
Sure beats the hell
out of pounding rocks

561
00:28:46,246 --> 00:28:47,726
down by the river.

562
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:49,075
You know,
I remember the time

563
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,773
when Cleopatra used to get
a hair up her ass

564
00:28:51,817 --> 00:28:53,732
and I'd have to go trudging
down to the water

565
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:55,646
and wash her... clothes.

566
00:28:57,126 --> 00:29:00,739
Well, well. Have we found
our possible sugar plum?

567
00:29:01,174 --> 00:29:02,653
It looks like love to me.

568
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:05,352
Yeah. You know, we walk
around the city all day,

569
00:29:05,787 --> 00:29:07,963
we end up four blocks
from where you live.

570
00:29:08,007 --> 00:29:09,791
Well, you know what they say
about finding everything

571
00:29:09,835 --> 00:29:11,314
you need
in your own backyard.

572
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:13,577
Fuck that shit, man.

573
00:29:13,621 --> 00:29:14,796
Are you sure
she's the right one?

574
00:29:15,362 --> 00:29:16,319
[Bobby] Look at her.

575
00:29:17,277 --> 00:29:20,541
She's beautiful, gentle, sexy.

576
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:23,805
And she folds clothes
just like the domestic type.

577
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:24,937
Yeah, she does.

578
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:26,765
That's the one.

579
00:29:27,853 --> 00:29:29,463
All right.
I've said it before.

580
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,117
Have a good life, Master.

581
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:32,858
-Bye.
-[clicks fingers]

582
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,841
Hi. I'm Isabelle.

583
00:30:00,842 --> 00:30:03,410
Hi. I'm Bobby.

584
00:30:05,325 --> 00:30:06,979
Let me do your laundry for you.

585
00:30:08,197 --> 00:30:11,810
Oh, I'm sorry.
Uh, I don't have any with me.

586
00:30:12,593 --> 00:30:14,987
Oh. I can wash
what you're wearing.

587
00:30:15,988 --> 00:30:17,511
Uh, thanks.

588
00:30:19,165 --> 00:30:20,427
Maybe some other time.

589
00:30:21,254 --> 00:30:22,603
Well, silly of me.

590
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:24,997
If I would have washed
what you're wearing,

591
00:30:25,258 --> 00:30:29,610
-you'd be completely naked.
-[laughter]

592
00:30:29,915 --> 00:30:31,438
Can I make dinner for you?

593
00:30:32,004 --> 00:30:33,048
Oh, sure.

594
00:30:34,049 --> 00:30:35,921
Wonderful.
Thank you.

595
00:30:37,531 --> 00:30:39,533
I'm afraid there's not much
in the way of food

596
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:41,187
back at my apartment.

597
00:30:41,709 --> 00:30:43,711
There's a grocery store
just around the corner.

598
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:46,583
We can go there
and buy everything I need

599
00:30:46,627 --> 00:30:48,368
to prepare you a feast.

600
00:30:48,411 --> 00:30:51,719
What do you like?
I can make anything you want.

601
00:30:52,067 --> 00:30:54,940
And if I don't already know
how to make it, I'll learn.

602
00:30:56,376 --> 00:30:57,551
I love you.

603
00:31:02,904 --> 00:31:04,732
I know it's here.
I know it's here.

604
00:31:04,993 --> 00:31:07,691
I know it's here.
I know it must be here.

605
00:31:07,735 --> 00:31:09,432
It's got to be here somewhere.

606
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:11,695
I know it's here.
I know it's here.

607
00:31:11,739 --> 00:31:13,175
It's here somewhere.

608
00:31:13,219 --> 00:31:15,308
It's here. It's here.
It's here. It's here. Oh.

609
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:19,225
Calm down, Foley.
We'll find it.

610
00:31:20,226 --> 00:31:22,097
We must remain calm.

611
00:31:24,273 --> 00:31:25,579
Yes.

612
00:31:26,101 --> 00:31:27,755
[grunts]

613
00:31:32,586 --> 00:31:33,892
[shop bell dings]

614
00:31:34,588 --> 00:31:36,198
[Bobby] Hi, Joan.
How was business?

615
00:31:36,242 --> 00:31:38,200
-Hi. I'm Isabelle.
-Hi.

616
00:31:38,244 --> 00:31:40,246
Uh, business was
kind of slow today.

617
00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:43,205
The closing sheets are here.
And I guess I'll be leaving.

618
00:31:43,249 --> 00:31:45,077
[Isabelle] Would you like
to join us for dinner?

619
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,730
[Bobby] Uh, no, Isabelle.
Joan has class.

620
00:31:46,774 --> 00:31:48,123
It's Saturday, remember?

621
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:50,256
Oh, yeah. Well, I'm sure
you have other plans,

622
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:53,085
so if you'll excuse us, I'll,
um, see you in the morning.

623
00:31:53,346 --> 00:31:54,913
Um, would you lock up?

624
00:31:56,001 --> 00:31:57,916
Yeah.
See you in the morning.

625
00:32:04,618 --> 00:32:07,534
Heaven.
I think I'm in heaven.

626
00:32:08,013 --> 00:32:10,493
I should apologize
for this mess, Isabelle.

627
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:12,974
You see, last night
we had a little party, and--

628
00:32:13,018 --> 00:32:15,411
Apologize?Apologize for nothing, darling.

629
00:32:15,455 --> 00:32:16,282
I love you.

630
00:32:17,805 --> 00:32:19,328
Where are the cleaning supplies?

631
00:32:19,372 --> 00:32:20,982
Under the sink.

632
00:32:21,026 --> 00:32:23,028
What a wonderful place
for cleaning supplies.

633
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:25,117
Oh.

634
00:32:31,036 --> 00:32:32,994
Oh, Isabelle.
You don't have to do that.

635
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:34,953
Oh, Bobby, yes, I do.

636
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:39,174
[screams]

637
00:32:39,218 --> 00:32:41,655
Furniture polish with lemon.
My favorite.

638
00:32:45,746 --> 00:32:48,836
Oh. Look at that shine.

639
00:32:50,316 --> 00:32:52,057
I can see myself in it.

640
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:54,973
And I can see you too.

641
00:32:56,583 --> 00:32:58,150
Dust balls everywhere.

642
00:33:01,066 --> 00:33:02,763
[truck horn honks]

643
00:33:05,157 --> 00:33:07,855
Hey, Isabelle, are you done?
I'm hungry.

644
00:33:07,898 --> 00:33:10,162
-Hi, Louie.
-Where's, uh, Isabelle?

645
00:33:10,205 --> 00:33:12,164
-She ain't here, Louie.
-Where is she?

646
00:33:12,207 --> 00:33:15,297
Don't know. Uh, she left
a couple of hours ago.

647
00:33:15,341 --> 00:33:17,386
Her and the Delaney boy
were walking up the street

648
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,170
in that direction.

649
00:33:19,606 --> 00:33:22,130
-Who's this Delaney kid?
-Delaney Antiques.

650
00:33:22,174 --> 00:33:24,306
A couple of blocks
over on Bleecker Street.

651
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:27,005
Ruth and Frank,
real nice people.

652
00:33:27,353 --> 00:33:30,008
Antiques? What the hell
does she want with used stuff?

653
00:33:30,051 --> 00:33:32,053
I buy her new. Everything she--

654
00:33:32,097 --> 00:33:33,794
-I buy her new. Everything she---Louie. Louie, the clothes.

655
00:33:34,099 --> 00:33:35,622
She left the clothes.

656
00:33:36,492 --> 00:33:38,538
-[Louie] She left the clothes?
-[woman] Uh-huh.

657
00:33:39,887 --> 00:33:41,019
That ain't like her.

658
00:33:41,236 --> 00:33:42,237
No.

659
00:33:43,151 --> 00:33:44,935
You sure she was feeling okay?

660
00:33:45,936 --> 00:33:47,547
Looked all right to me.

661
00:33:50,811 --> 00:33:52,595
[vacuum whirring]

662
00:34:07,741 --> 00:34:10,570
-You through now?
-Yes. I think so.

663
00:34:11,397 --> 00:34:13,051
-You are?
-Yeah.

664
00:34:13,747 --> 00:34:15,662
[moaning]

665
00:34:16,924 --> 00:34:18,360
[screams]

666
00:34:18,404 --> 00:34:20,058
The shelves.
The top of the shelves.

667
00:34:22,234 --> 00:34:25,237
Oh. Bobby, will you help me?
Lift me on your shoulders.

668
00:34:25,672 --> 00:34:28,066
Do you really have to clean
the top of the shelves now?

669
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:30,416
Yes, I do.
Lift me on your shoulders.

670
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:33,201
-Okay. One leg.
-[Bobby] Okay.

671
00:34:33,245 --> 00:34:34,898
-Okay?-[Bobby] All right. Now, get up.

672
00:34:34,942 --> 00:34:36,378
-Yeah.
-Okay. Can you get up now?

673
00:34:36,422 --> 00:34:38,119
-[Bobby] Yeah. Hold on.
-I'm holding on.

674
00:34:38,163 --> 00:34:39,903
-[Bobby] Oh, okay.
-Okay. Turn around.

675
00:34:39,947 --> 00:34:41,209
-This one in here?
-Yes. Yes.

676
00:34:41,253 --> 00:34:43,646
-Close-- Oh, yeah.
-[Bobby] Oh, yes.

677
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:46,127
Yes.
Oh, little to the right.

678
00:34:46,171 --> 00:34:47,737
-[Bobby] Okay.
-The right.

679
00:34:47,781 --> 00:34:50,088
-The left. Left. The left.
-[Bobby] Okay. Your left?

680
00:34:50,131 --> 00:34:51,828
-Oh. You comfortable, honey?
-[Bobby] Oh, yes.

681
00:34:51,872 --> 00:34:53,134
-All right.
-[Bobby] And after

682
00:34:53,178 --> 00:34:54,744
we clean these shelves,
there's lots more

683
00:34:54,788 --> 00:34:56,485
-in the bedroom. [chuckles]
-Oh.

684
00:34:56,529 --> 00:34:59,401
-[alarm buzzing]-Oh, you'll have to put me down.

685
00:34:59,445 --> 00:35:01,621
That's the timer.
Dinner should be ready soon.

686
00:35:01,664 --> 00:35:04,624
-[Bobby] Okay.
-[grunting]

687
00:35:06,147 --> 00:35:08,454
Oh. You're so playful.

688
00:35:08,976 --> 00:35:11,021
Need your dinner though.
Keep that strength up.

689
00:35:12,197 --> 00:35:13,807
[humming]

690
00:35:14,503 --> 00:35:16,984
There's lots more shelves
to be dusted in the bedroom.

691
00:35:17,332 --> 00:35:20,118
Oh, you silly.
There's a time for everything.

692
00:35:20,466 --> 00:35:23,295
Now is the time for feasting,
not cleaning.

693
00:35:25,688 --> 00:35:27,299
Mm. Perfect.

694
00:35:28,169 --> 00:35:29,910
Does everything smell
good to you, darling?

695
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:31,564
Smells delicious.
[chuckles]

696
00:35:33,218 --> 00:35:36,134
Well, we've 30 minutes to spare.What would you like to do?

697
00:35:37,744 --> 00:35:40,225
-Let me show you the bedroom.
-Wonderful.

698
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:43,315
-Lead me onward.
-[chuckling]

699
00:35:45,578 --> 00:35:48,015
-Come this way.
-Oh, it's so clean.

700
00:35:49,712 --> 00:35:50,670
It's in here.

701
00:35:51,497 --> 00:35:52,367
[grunts]

702
00:35:53,194 --> 00:35:55,153
[moaning]

703
00:35:56,545 --> 00:35:58,373
Mind if I get a little more
comfortable?

704
00:35:58,852 --> 00:36:00,680
No. Not at all.
Please be my guest.

705
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,338
[Bobby] Oh. Oh.

706
00:36:08,514 --> 00:36:10,777
Oh. Oh.

707
00:36:12,082 --> 00:36:13,562
-Ew.
-[Bobby] Oh.

708
00:36:14,084 --> 00:36:16,174
Ew. Ew!

709
00:36:17,697 --> 00:36:19,481
What's the matter?

710
00:36:19,525 --> 00:36:21,701
Uh, I thought you said
now is the time for feasting,

711
00:36:21,744 --> 00:36:22,745
not for cleaning.

712
00:36:23,224 --> 00:36:25,183
A woman's work is never done.

713
00:36:25,574 --> 00:36:27,185
[tuts]

714
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:29,839
When was the last time
you laundered these?

715
00:36:29,883 --> 00:36:31,319
[Bobby] I don't know.

716
00:36:31,363 --> 00:36:33,495
But I think they're good
for one more round,

717
00:36:33,539 --> 00:36:34,844
if you know what I mean?

718
00:36:34,888 --> 00:36:36,933
I know what you mean,
but, no, they're not.

719
00:36:36,977 --> 00:36:39,197
They're filthy.
They're... [groans]

720
00:36:39,414 --> 00:36:40,589
Ew.

721
00:36:42,374 --> 00:36:44,593
-What are you doing?
-Now, you stay right there.

722
00:36:44,637 --> 00:36:46,204
This should only take
a couple of hours.

723
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:47,379
But dinner.

724
00:36:48,771 --> 00:36:50,556
I'll turn everything
down a bit.

725
00:36:50,904 --> 00:36:53,080
It'll be even more succulent
that way.

726
00:36:53,123 --> 00:36:55,778
All the raw meat juices
mixing with the potatoes

727
00:36:56,126 --> 00:36:58,781
and the carrots. Mm.

728
00:36:59,565 --> 00:37:00,740
Oh.

729
00:37:01,088 --> 00:37:04,744
Hey, Bobby. It's me,
and I'm through with work.

730
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,790
-I'm all yours.
-Oh, shit.

731
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:13,840
It's Stella, and I'm here
to party, party, party.

732
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:20,107
Hey, Bobby, lover boy.
It's Stella.

733
00:37:20,629 --> 00:37:23,284
-Who's that, darling?
-Uh, a friend,

734
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:25,634
loves antiques.
Can't keep her away.

735
00:37:25,678 --> 00:37:27,723
Oh, how sweet.
You go take care of her

736
00:37:27,767 --> 00:37:29,595
while I finish up
in the bedroom, bathroom,

737
00:37:29,638 --> 00:37:31,814
laundry room, and whatever elseneeds my attention.

738
00:37:31,858 --> 00:37:34,295
I need your attention.

739
00:37:34,948 --> 00:37:36,776
Bobby, are you up there?

740
00:37:37,385 --> 00:37:40,258
I know you're up there.
I can see you moving.

741
00:37:45,306 --> 00:37:48,962
Woo.
I'm starting without you.

742
00:37:52,357 --> 00:37:53,445
[truck horn honking]

743
00:37:56,883 --> 00:37:57,971
Hey, Isabelle!

744
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:00,974
-Isabelle!
-Isabelle, come here.

745
00:38:01,366 --> 00:38:04,064
-Yes, darling.
-Who's that?

746
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:05,979
Oh, that's Louie, my husband.

747
00:38:07,372 --> 00:38:09,330
-Your what?
-My husband.

748
00:38:09,374 --> 00:38:11,201
The man I used to love.

749
00:38:11,985 --> 00:38:13,856
Oh, God!

750
00:38:14,161 --> 00:38:16,729
Hey, Isabelle, where are you?
I'm hungry!

751
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:18,513
Oh, he's always hungry.

752
00:38:18,557 --> 00:38:20,863
Maybe we should invite himto dinner. And your friend too.

753
00:38:21,168 --> 00:38:23,126
No, Isabelle.
That's not a good idea.

754
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:26,086
Look, I think you have a fewthings to take care of at home.

755
00:38:26,391 --> 00:38:29,176
-[Stella] Bobby!
-[Bobby] After you fix things.

756
00:38:29,394 --> 00:38:31,091
[Isabelle] Oh, he's a lamb.

757
00:38:31,526 --> 00:38:33,659
Get dressed.
Hurry.

758
00:38:34,486 --> 00:38:36,836
Party, party, party!

759
00:38:36,879 --> 00:38:39,665
Boy, she sure does wanna getat those antiques, doesn't she?

760
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:41,014
[Louie] Isabelle!

761
00:38:41,971 --> 00:38:43,973
Oh, I'll tell Louie
it's over with.

762
00:38:44,017 --> 00:38:46,367
Then I can move in,
and we can get married

763
00:38:46,411 --> 00:38:48,151
after the divorce.

764
00:38:48,195 --> 00:38:50,980
Isabelle, we must remain
calm and act maturely

765
00:38:51,024 --> 00:38:52,852
-in this situation!
-Of course.

766
00:38:52,895 --> 00:38:56,203
You just go on home, now.
Think about everything.

767
00:38:56,551 --> 00:38:59,337
We'll talk in the morning.
I think you owe that to Louie.

768
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,469
He seems like
a really nice guy.

769
00:39:01,513 --> 00:39:03,341
We wouldn't wanna hurt
his feelings, would we?

770
00:39:04,211 --> 00:39:05,430
No. You're right.

771
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:08,215
You're so considerate.
That's why I love you.

772
00:39:09,042 --> 00:39:10,348
[Bobby] Go. Go.

773
00:39:12,262 --> 00:39:13,742
[panting]

774
00:39:14,743 --> 00:39:17,355
That sure wasn't the one.

775
00:39:18,225 --> 00:39:19,661
[coughs]

776
00:39:19,705 --> 00:39:22,098
Fuck. I haven't even
gotten to first base yet.

777
00:39:22,142 --> 00:39:24,274
Don't wipe it off.I'll be back in a little while.

778
00:39:25,014 --> 00:39:27,669
-That's what you said last time.-Hey, don't get wise with me.

779
00:39:27,713 --> 00:39:29,497
You gladiators
win a chariot race

780
00:39:29,541 --> 00:39:31,281
and you think you got Rome
by the balls?

781
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:34,894
That'll tie you over.

782
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:36,374
[clicks fingers]

783
00:39:39,594 --> 00:39:41,553
-Hi, Louie.
-[Louie] Where you been?

784
00:39:41,814 --> 00:39:44,033
-Oh--
-I never knew

785
00:39:44,077 --> 00:39:45,731
-you liked antiques. Come on.
-I don't.

786
00:39:45,992 --> 00:39:48,429
Then what was you doing
in this used furniture joint

787
00:39:48,473 --> 00:39:49,691
anyhow? Come on.

788
00:39:49,735 --> 00:39:50,997
Hey. Hey!

789
00:39:51,258 --> 00:39:53,739
[sobbing]
Have you seen Bobby Delaney?

790
00:39:54,087 --> 00:39:57,090
Yes, I have. Hope you find
something you like.

791
00:39:57,438 --> 00:40:01,573
Oh, Bobby!
Bobby, open this door!

792
00:40:02,922 --> 00:40:04,489
I want to party!

793
00:40:06,578 --> 00:40:08,754
I think I see the problem.

794
00:40:10,495 --> 00:40:11,626
[clicks fingers]

795
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:15,500
-Wrong one?
-[Bobby] Yeah. Wrong one.

796
00:40:16,936 --> 00:40:18,416
And what about Stella?

797
00:40:18,981 --> 00:40:22,115
Why is she still downstairs
acting like she loves me?

798
00:40:22,637 --> 00:40:24,813
Because she, uh... She does.

799
00:40:26,293 --> 00:40:27,599
Well, do something about it.

800
00:40:28,338 --> 00:40:30,819
Twirl and shake and unzap her.

801
00:40:31,124 --> 00:40:33,518
Uh, I can't. I forgot.

802
00:40:33,779 --> 00:40:35,302
What?

803
00:40:35,345 --> 00:40:38,436
You mean you left me hereknowing she'd still be after me?

804
00:40:38,784 --> 00:40:40,089
Well, the more, the merrier,

805
00:40:40,133 --> 00:40:42,135
-I always say.
-Well, that's not what I say!

806
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:44,616
Hey, don't get huffy
with me, Master.

807
00:40:45,617 --> 00:40:47,314
Let me think. Let me think.

808
00:40:47,706 --> 00:40:51,318
Hurry down, Bobby.
It's gonna be all gone.

809
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,363
Think faster.

810
00:40:53,886 --> 00:40:56,802
Well, while I'm thinking,
why don't you decide exactly

811
00:40:56,845 --> 00:40:59,326
what kind of woman
you really want.

812
00:41:00,414 --> 00:41:04,636
Not until you break the spell
on Stella and Isabelle.

813
00:41:05,506 --> 00:41:07,595
[Dancee] Well,
that may take a while.

814
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:10,076
Why don't you get me a beer
while I think about it.

815
00:41:12,992 --> 00:41:14,472
Uh-oh.

816
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,871
I was right. I was right.
[laughs]

817
00:41:23,176 --> 00:41:26,919
I was right. I was right.
I was right. [laughs]

818
00:41:29,182 --> 00:41:32,098
I'm going to be famous.
[kisses]

819
00:41:34,535 --> 00:41:37,364
No one must get in my way.
No one.

820
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:48,070
Bobby, come on.
What's taking you so...

821
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:50,856
[hiccups] ...long.
[laughs]

822
00:41:50,899 --> 00:41:53,206
[Dancee] The river Nile
flows and weeps

823
00:41:53,423 --> 00:41:55,556
in the moonless sky,
long and deep,

824
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,993
another time,
another space,

825
00:41:58,037 --> 00:42:00,082
we'll find us all
back in this place.

826
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:03,259
She looks like
she's having a good time.

827
00:42:03,303 --> 00:42:04,130
Come on.

828
00:42:05,871 --> 00:42:08,221
[laughs]

829
00:42:09,614 --> 00:42:12,834
Look, Master, this genie stuff
is all new to me.

830
00:42:12,878 --> 00:42:15,620
I mean, I've been reading booksfor the past 2,000 years.

831
00:42:15,924 --> 00:42:18,231
This is my
first job experience.

832
00:42:18,666 --> 00:42:21,147
[Bobby] Great.
And I'm that job, right?

833
00:42:21,408 --> 00:42:23,236
[Dancee] Yeah.
You're damn right.

834
00:42:23,584 --> 00:42:25,368
Now, let's find that love
of your life.

835
00:42:25,412 --> 00:42:27,240
I'll take care
of the other two later.

836
00:42:27,588 --> 00:42:29,851
What kind of female
do you really wanna share

837
00:42:29,895 --> 00:42:31,244
the rest of your life with?

838
00:42:31,287 --> 00:42:33,594
[Bobby] Well, my first two
choices sure were wrong.

839
00:42:33,638 --> 00:42:35,596
[Dancee] Not wrong,
just a little off.

840
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,077
[Bobby] Maybe this time
I need someone passionate,

841
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,252
but mature.

842
00:42:39,948 --> 00:42:41,733
Someone aggressively confident.

843
00:42:42,342 --> 00:42:44,213
That describes half
the girls in New York.

844
00:42:44,257 --> 00:42:45,867
Could you be
a little more specific?

845
00:42:45,911 --> 00:42:47,608
-Classy.
-And single.

846
00:42:47,652 --> 00:42:49,567
Definitely. And remember sexy.

847
00:42:49,915 --> 00:42:51,177
[women screaming]

848
00:42:55,137 --> 00:42:56,748
Rachel Richards.

849
00:42:57,139 --> 00:42:58,967
-Who's that?
-A movie star.

850
00:42:59,446 --> 00:43:02,231
-What's that?
-It's... Never mind.

851
00:43:02,275 --> 00:43:03,972
-She's gorgeous.
-Confident,

852
00:43:04,277 --> 00:43:07,410
aggressive, mature.
Certainly sexy.

853
00:43:07,454 --> 00:43:09,761
-What?
-What about it?

854
00:43:09,804 --> 00:43:12,198
-What about what?
-Her, silly.

855
00:43:12,502 --> 00:43:14,069
Wait. Wait.
Wait a minute.

856
00:43:14,113 --> 00:43:16,898
I have a 4:00 call tomorrow.
I have to be on my way, okay?

857
00:43:16,942 --> 00:43:18,291
-[indistinct chatter]
-I must be on my way.

858
00:43:18,683 --> 00:43:20,119
You really think so?

859
00:43:20,728 --> 00:43:23,122
What do I know?
Looks like a hot mama to me.

860
00:43:23,383 --> 00:43:25,037
Okay. Okay. I'm ready.

861
00:43:25,733 --> 00:43:27,735
-You have a good--
-Good life. Yeah. You too.

862
00:43:27,779 --> 00:43:29,694
-Goodbye.
-Bye. [clicks fingers]

863
00:43:30,172 --> 00:43:32,305
[indistinct chatter]

864
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:00,986
Wow.
Who are you?

865
00:44:01,551 --> 00:44:03,031
I'm Bobby Delaney.

866
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:06,252
I'm Rachel Richards.
And I love you.

867
00:44:06,818 --> 00:44:07,645
Come.

868
00:44:09,864 --> 00:44:11,344
Where to, Ms. Richards?

869
00:44:11,866 --> 00:44:14,173
Bobby's place.
Tell him your address, Bobby.

870
00:44:14,521 --> 00:44:16,654
Down in the village,
on Bleecker Street,

871
00:44:16,697 --> 00:44:18,003
Delaney Antiques.

872
00:44:23,269 --> 00:44:26,011
[fans screaming]

873
00:44:26,272 --> 00:44:28,056
Where have you been
all my life?

874
00:44:28,535 --> 00:44:30,363
I've been on Bleecker Street.

875
00:44:30,711 --> 00:44:32,670
So is the address
of this antique joint.

876
00:44:32,887 --> 00:44:34,454
[chuckles]

877
00:44:34,497 --> 00:44:38,676
Don't you dare use that toneof voice with me, sl... Dexter.

878
00:44:39,067 --> 00:44:42,070
[chuckles] Tell himyour address, Bobby, sweetheart.

879
00:44:42,114 --> 00:44:45,421
It's 84 Bleecker Street,
across from the bakery.

880
00:44:45,465 --> 00:44:48,294
That's enough. That's enough.
Did you get that... Dexter?

881
00:44:48,903 --> 00:44:50,688
Oh, yes, ma'am.
I'm-- I'm sorry.

882
00:44:51,776 --> 00:44:53,081
Excuse me for interrupting.

883
00:44:54,082 --> 00:44:55,780
Don't you think
you're a little rough on him?

884
00:44:56,389 --> 00:44:58,304
Rough? [laughs]

885
00:44:58,739 --> 00:45:00,915
I'm never rough on those
who attend to me,

886
00:45:01,307 --> 00:45:02,569
only in charge.

887
00:45:02,917 --> 00:45:05,180
-Oh. I see.
-Now, where were we?

888
00:45:05,224 --> 00:45:07,400
You-- You were licking my ear.

889
00:45:08,096 --> 00:45:11,230
-Ow! Ow!
-[laughs] Don't worry.

890
00:45:11,491 --> 00:45:12,884
Get used to it.

891
00:45:19,325 --> 00:45:21,283
[panting]

892
00:45:22,545 --> 00:45:25,070
-Who's that?
-Shh. We don't wanna wake her.

893
00:45:25,418 --> 00:45:27,855
Whatever. Dexter,
get the rest of the supplies

894
00:45:27,899 --> 00:45:29,596
-and come with us.
-[Bobby] What supplies?

895
00:45:29,639 --> 00:45:31,816
Things to make me
and you happy.

896
00:45:32,077 --> 00:45:33,426
Come on.

897
00:45:43,828 --> 00:45:45,438
[laughs]

898
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:50,748
Too small.

899
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:56,754
Too bright.

900
00:46:03,543 --> 00:46:04,762
This room.

901
00:46:04,805 --> 00:46:06,372
[Dexter panting]

902
00:46:08,113 --> 00:46:09,767
[rattling]

903
00:46:11,856 --> 00:46:13,771
So, you're Bobby.

904
00:46:14,162 --> 00:46:15,468
[panting]

905
00:46:15,903 --> 00:46:18,297
I'll go get the rest
of the things.

906
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:19,428
There's more?

907
00:46:19,472 --> 00:46:21,779
Oh, Bobby.
Help me with this record.

908
00:46:24,129 --> 00:46:25,173
Now!

909
00:46:26,218 --> 00:46:27,785
What is it?

910
00:46:29,351 --> 00:46:30,657
[Rachel] You'll see.

911
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:35,488
Something to help me
get into the mood.

912
00:46:35,923 --> 00:46:38,970
[tango music playing]

913
00:46:57,379 --> 00:46:59,033
You ready to dance, Bobby?

914
00:46:59,512 --> 00:47:00,818
Oh, my God.

915
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:17,356
Ow!

916
00:47:21,447 --> 00:47:24,406
Oh, great outfit, Ms. Richards.

917
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:26,234
Shut up, slave.
Get to work.

918
00:47:26,278 --> 00:47:27,975
Right away. Right away.

919
00:47:28,019 --> 00:47:29,977
-[Bobby] Ow!
-Promise me you'll beat me.

920
00:47:30,021 --> 00:47:32,371
I don't make promises
to you, slave.

921
00:47:32,414 --> 00:47:33,720
Get to work.

922
00:47:35,243 --> 00:47:36,288
Come on, my sweet...

923
00:47:43,948 --> 00:47:45,471
My, oh, my.

924
00:47:48,561 --> 00:47:52,478
Rub the bottle in a circular
motion... [panting]

925
00:47:53,653 --> 00:47:55,046
You're not devoted, naked!

926
00:47:55,394 --> 00:47:56,482
Don't.

927
00:48:37,784 --> 00:48:40,004
[tango music continues]

928
00:48:45,705 --> 00:48:47,925
[phone ringing]

929
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:51,406
Hello? Hello?

930
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:53,800
I just wanted to let you know
that I miss you, Bobby.

931
00:48:54,061 --> 00:48:55,628
No, no, no.
Don't say anything.

932
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:58,500
I just wanted to let you know
that I love you.

933
00:48:59,806 --> 00:49:01,547
-Who is that?
-Uh, a friend.

934
00:49:01,808 --> 00:49:02,940
A girlfriend?

935
00:49:03,853 --> 00:49:05,594
-Why you...
-Don't. Wait.

936
00:49:05,638 --> 00:49:07,466
-What are you doing?
-Shut up, slave.

937
00:49:08,336 --> 00:49:10,034
Dance with your master.

938
00:49:10,295 --> 00:49:12,297
I'll have you know
that I'm the master.

939
00:49:12,514 --> 00:49:13,820
-Says who?
-Says Dancee.

940
00:49:14,168 --> 00:49:15,735
Dancee. [laughs]

941
00:49:16,518 --> 00:49:18,477
Yes. Let's "“dancee"” more.

942
00:49:20,174 --> 00:49:20,958
There.

943
00:49:26,572 --> 00:49:27,616
[groans]

944
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:29,357
Done with Dancee, slave?

945
00:49:30,489 --> 00:49:32,317
Let's check out the game room.

946
00:49:32,578 --> 00:49:34,014
-Fun.
-Ow!

947
00:49:34,058 --> 00:49:35,450
-Fun.
-Ow!

948
00:49:35,494 --> 00:49:36,799
-Fun.
-Ow!

949
00:49:36,843 --> 00:49:38,062
[laughs]

950
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:41,065
Circular motion to the right.

951
00:49:43,154 --> 00:49:46,374
Oh, maybe it was
a circular motion to the left.

952
00:49:46,766 --> 00:49:48,159
[moans]

953
00:49:49,073 --> 00:49:52,032
Where's the genie?
Come to me, genie.

954
00:49:52,076 --> 00:49:53,077
Come to me.

955
00:49:54,904 --> 00:49:57,037
That little worm, Bobby,
must have already

956
00:49:57,342 --> 00:49:58,386
released the genie.

957
00:50:06,786 --> 00:50:10,050
No. Please don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me.

958
00:50:10,094 --> 00:50:12,052
-Shut up, slave.
-But I'm your slave.

959
00:50:12,357 --> 00:50:15,012
You're my scumbag.
This is my slave.

960
00:50:15,055 --> 00:50:16,752
Ooh, I like that even better.

961
00:50:16,796 --> 00:50:19,538
Scumbag!
Oh, I love being a scumbag.

962
00:50:19,886 --> 00:50:21,627
-[laughs]
-Shut up!

963
00:50:22,106 --> 00:50:24,369
-Come on.
-Oh, what are you doing?

964
00:50:24,717 --> 00:50:27,763
-Shut up! Get in.
-Ow! I'm in. I'm in.

965
00:50:27,807 --> 00:50:28,851
Man the pulley.

966
00:50:28,895 --> 00:50:31,158
-[Dexter snickers]
-What? Oh.

967
00:50:31,202 --> 00:50:33,247
-[Rachel] Get in.
-[Bobby] Oh.

968
00:50:34,379 --> 00:50:35,858
[Rachel] Shut up.

969
00:50:35,902 --> 00:50:37,860
[Bobby screams]

970
00:50:37,904 --> 00:50:40,385
[laughter]

971
00:50:41,951 --> 00:50:44,215
Please...
Please let me down.

972
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:45,912
Uh, I--
I'll do anything you want.

973
00:50:46,173 --> 00:50:47,783
[laughs]

974
00:50:47,827 --> 00:50:52,223
That's why you're here,
to do anything I want.

975
00:50:52,571 --> 00:50:54,747
[evil laugh]

976
00:50:54,921 --> 00:50:57,054
-[Bobby groaning]
-[Rachel laughing]

977
00:51:11,111 --> 00:51:13,287
Hmm. I think I'll wait
till they're done.

978
00:51:15,768 --> 00:51:17,639
[Bobby groaning]

979
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:47,104
[machine beeping]

980
00:51:47,147 --> 00:51:49,106
-[Rachel] What's that?
-Oh, it's your Calltend.

981
00:51:49,149 --> 00:51:51,151
They want you on the set
in half an hour.

982
00:51:51,195 --> 00:51:52,805
Just when I was getting
to my favorite part.

983
00:51:53,153 --> 00:51:54,763
Secure him, Dexter.
We'll save him for later.

984
00:51:54,807 --> 00:51:55,677
Yes, Master.

985
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:00,291
See you later, wimp.

986
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:03,642
How do I look, Dexter?

987
00:52:03,903 --> 00:52:05,470
-Oh, ravishing.
-I know.

988
00:52:05,992 --> 00:52:08,125
-The public awaits.
-[Dexter laughs]

989
00:52:09,038 --> 00:52:10,692
[phone ringing]

990
00:52:12,346 --> 00:52:13,347
[line ringing]

991
00:52:19,832 --> 00:52:21,747
[groans]

992
00:52:24,706 --> 00:52:26,143
She's gonna kill me.

993
00:52:26,186 --> 00:52:27,753
But that wasn't the one.

994
00:52:28,797 --> 00:52:30,712
What the fuck
happened this time?

995
00:52:30,756 --> 00:52:31,583
Sorry.

996
00:52:32,236 --> 00:52:33,715
I know. I know.

997
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:35,761
Believe me, I'm not coming backhere again.

998
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:38,720
We're taking care of this
once and for all.

999
00:52:39,068 --> 00:52:41,158
-Right, Master?
-Right.

1000
00:52:43,203 --> 00:52:44,204
[sighs]

1001
00:52:44,248 --> 00:52:46,337
Ooh. Pretty professional, huh?

1002
00:52:46,772 --> 00:52:48,643
Please just let me down.

1003
00:52:48,687 --> 00:52:50,167
[Dancee] Pretty hardcore, huh?

1004
00:52:50,341 --> 00:52:53,692
Yeah. You sure can pick them.
Hurry, Dancee.

1005
00:52:53,735 --> 00:52:55,781
These ropes are killing me.

1006
00:52:56,042 --> 00:52:58,175
[Dancee] Hurrying as fast
as I can, Master.

1007
00:52:58,218 --> 00:53:00,220
And don't call me
master anymore.

1008
00:53:00,525 --> 00:53:03,049
I've had enough of that shit
to last a lifetime.

1009
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:05,530
[Dancee]
Okay. I-- I almost have it.

1010
00:53:06,052 --> 00:53:07,184
[groans]

1011
00:53:08,446 --> 00:53:11,188
[Dancee] Ah, there you go, Mas--Uh, I mean, honey.

1012
00:53:11,231 --> 00:53:14,191
Thanks, Dancee.
You're a lifesaver.

1013
00:53:14,582 --> 00:53:17,629
I think you forgot something
the last time you left.

1014
00:53:18,238 --> 00:53:19,500
What?

1015
00:53:19,544 --> 00:53:22,764
Stella. Isabelle.
And now we have a Rachel.

1016
00:53:23,069 --> 00:53:25,550
-Oh, that.
-Yes, that.

1017
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:29,554
Look, can I just cancel
this true love wish?

1018
00:53:29,597 --> 00:53:31,817
Uh, I-- I'll take money,
a yacht, jewels. You name it.

1019
00:53:32,121 --> 00:53:33,297
I can't do that.

1020
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,212
Why not?

1021
00:53:36,343 --> 00:53:39,651
Because the only way
to undo a wish is if you die.

1022
00:53:43,263 --> 00:53:46,092
Well, I'm not gonna die
just to cancel out a wish.

1023
00:53:46,962 --> 00:53:49,313
Uh, there's got to be
another way besides death.

1024
00:53:50,618 --> 00:53:52,620
What would happen to you
if I should die?

1025
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,232
I'd be at the mercy
of my next owner.

1026
00:53:56,102 --> 00:53:58,104
[Bobby] You mean you'd have
to start from scratch?

1027
00:53:58,147 --> 00:54:00,585
-Three wishes to the next owner?-Yup.

1028
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:03,414
Well, we better get started
on this last wish,

1029
00:54:03,457 --> 00:54:06,155
so you can get your freedom,
and I can get some rest.

1030
00:54:06,939 --> 00:54:08,636
Rest in peace, you mean.

1031
00:54:09,115 --> 00:54:10,551
You better freshen up.

1032
00:54:10,595 --> 00:54:12,031
Couldn't I just take a nap?

1033
00:54:12,379 --> 00:54:14,251
You're the onewho needs to finish this thing,

1034
00:54:14,294 --> 00:54:16,078
so let's go.

1035
00:54:16,122 --> 00:54:18,385
[Bobby] While I get dressed,
you start thinking about

1036
00:54:18,429 --> 00:54:20,822
how to unzap those three
old monsters after me.

1037
00:54:21,127 --> 00:54:23,260
Oh, you don't mind
If I take this with me

1038
00:54:23,869 --> 00:54:26,611
-when I leave, do you?
-The poem, Dancee. The poem.

1039
00:54:27,307 --> 00:54:29,048
Oh, okay. Okay.

1040
00:54:29,831 --> 00:54:33,444
Uh, pharaohs old
and pharaohs new,

1041
00:54:34,836 --> 00:54:37,274
whirling sand dunes
embracing you,

1042
00:54:38,492 --> 00:54:41,321
relieve the innocent
from forgotten spells,

1043
00:54:42,322 --> 00:54:45,325
and set the pathway
straight to hell.

1044
00:54:45,978 --> 00:54:48,459
-[laughs]
-Well?

1045
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:51,984
Uh, it's coming.
But, uh, let's go.

1046
00:54:52,332 --> 00:54:53,594
Come on. Let's go hunting.

1047
00:54:53,638 --> 00:54:55,596
Let me think it through
clearly this time.

1048
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:56,771
What?

1049
00:54:57,206 --> 00:55:00,166
Last time, I was swept away
into the moment. No more.

1050
00:55:00,688 --> 00:55:02,734
Ooh. I kind of like
being swept away.

1051
00:55:03,212 --> 00:55:04,997
I don't want
some partying punk rocker.

1052
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:06,781
Okay. No more Stellas.

1053
00:55:06,825 --> 00:55:08,348
And I don't want someone
to play mother.

1054
00:55:08,392 --> 00:55:09,871
Oh, and not another Isabelle.

1055
00:55:09,915 --> 00:55:11,960
And I especially don't want
anyone kinky.

1056
00:55:12,004 --> 00:55:13,484
Scratch the movie star.

1057
00:55:13,701 --> 00:55:15,703
Let's make it simple this time.

1058
00:55:15,747 --> 00:55:16,748
Simple.

1059
00:55:17,183 --> 00:55:19,838
Intelligent, organized, mature.

1060
00:55:19,881 --> 00:55:22,797
Uh, a girl who's pretty,
enjoys some sexuality.

1061
00:55:22,841 --> 00:55:25,191
Ooh. Now we're getting
to the good part. [laughs]

1062
00:55:25,452 --> 00:55:27,324
-That's it.
-That's it?

1063
00:55:31,197 --> 00:55:33,068
Will we be back by 9:00,
do you think?

1064
00:55:33,112 --> 00:55:34,461
Uh, I don't know.

1065
00:55:34,505 --> 00:55:37,421
I got to leave the door open
for Joan. Let's go.

1066
00:55:47,692 --> 00:55:49,433
[Bobby] So what about the poem?

1067
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:51,696
[Dancee] I'm working on it.

1068
00:55:52,479 --> 00:55:54,176
Hey, how does this sound?

1069
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:56,396
Two thousand years
of waiting alone

1070
00:55:56,701 --> 00:55:58,703
inside my bottle
for someone to phone.

1071
00:55:59,138 --> 00:56:00,705
[Bobby] You had a phone?

1072
00:56:00,922 --> 00:56:03,751
[Dancee] Uh, well, no,
but it sounded good.

1073
00:56:04,404 --> 00:56:06,928
-[Bobby] Keep thinking.
-[Dancee] Okay. Okay.

1074
00:56:07,233 --> 00:56:09,931
Sunday morning doesn't seem
to be the hunting hour.

1075
00:56:10,541 --> 00:56:11,759
Oh, relax.

1076
00:56:12,412 --> 00:56:14,762
You know, these buildings
in New York, they amaze me.

1077
00:56:15,633 --> 00:56:18,026
I can't figure out
how did the workers

1078
00:56:18,070 --> 00:56:20,159
get the things
all the way to the top?

1079
00:56:21,726 --> 00:56:25,077
I mean, the pyramids were big,
but these are humongous.

1080
00:56:25,773 --> 00:56:27,601
Well, they have machines
to do it.

1081
00:56:28,167 --> 00:56:30,952
Machines, computers
do everything these days.

1082
00:56:31,475 --> 00:56:33,390
What is a computer?

1083
00:56:34,434 --> 00:56:36,088
Well, it's hard to explain.

1084
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:38,395
They're these little
microchips and...

1085
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:41,093
That's a computer.

1086
00:56:42,442 --> 00:56:44,749
[Dancee] That builds all
these buildings?

1087
00:56:44,792 --> 00:56:45,837
[Bobby] Yeah, in a way.

1088
00:56:47,099 --> 00:56:48,492
She is beautiful.

1089
00:56:48,753 --> 00:56:50,537
Hey. What do you think?
What do you think?

1090
00:56:50,581 --> 00:56:53,279
-Looks intelligent, organized...-And pretty?

1091
00:56:53,627 --> 00:56:55,412
-I don't need your coaxing.
-Oh, sorry.

1092
00:56:56,108 --> 00:56:57,631
What the hell?
Zap her.

1093
00:56:58,110 --> 00:56:59,720
Ooh, I hope this is the one.

1094
00:56:59,764 --> 00:57:02,723
Uh, wait! What about Stella,
Isabelle and Rachel?

1095
00:57:02,767 --> 00:57:05,465
Uh, with your luck,
I'll be back in a few hours.

1096
00:57:05,509 --> 00:57:07,293
But what
if this is the real thing?

1097
00:57:07,554 --> 00:57:10,992
Hey, um, what did you just say?The real thing?

1098
00:57:12,037 --> 00:57:13,604
Uh, that strikes a brainwave.
Um, uh...

1099
00:57:13,647 --> 00:57:15,301
You remember
how to unzap them all?

1100
00:57:15,562 --> 00:57:17,129
Ooh, it's coming.
It's coming. Ooh.

1101
00:57:17,477 --> 00:57:19,087
Ooh. And I'd like to be too

1102
00:57:19,131 --> 00:57:20,306
-so I'll see you later.
-Uh, but--

1103
00:57:20,349 --> 00:57:21,481
[clicks fingers]

1104
00:57:38,542 --> 00:57:41,458
-Do I know you?
-I don't think so?

1105
00:57:41,806 --> 00:57:43,764
[clicks fingers]
The Frank and Clarke merger.

1106
00:57:43,808 --> 00:57:45,113
You're on the Clarke team,
right?

1107
00:57:45,157 --> 00:57:46,463
No.

1108
00:57:46,506 --> 00:57:48,334
But I sort of own
an antique shop.

1109
00:57:48,595 --> 00:57:51,293
Really? Now, that's an area
of investment

1110
00:57:51,337 --> 00:57:52,773
I've never dabbled in before,

1111
00:57:52,817 --> 00:57:55,123
but I hear there's a lotof money to be made in antiques.

1112
00:57:55,167 --> 00:57:57,082
-Well, not that.
-Wait. Wait.

1113
00:57:57,909 --> 00:57:59,824
There's something going on here.

1114
00:58:00,172 --> 00:58:03,523
Some sort of transaction
I'm feeling towards you.

1115
00:58:04,524 --> 00:58:06,352
I've never felt this way before.

1116
00:58:06,961 --> 00:58:08,093
Could it be love?

1117
00:58:09,268 --> 00:58:11,400
I don't know.
I hope so.

1118
00:58:12,576 --> 00:58:16,188
I feel like I'm walking on air.It's wonderful.

1119
00:58:17,102 --> 00:58:20,192
Now, tell me about all the moneyyou've made in antiques.

1120
00:58:20,888 --> 00:58:22,934
[Bobby] Well, I guess the shop
takes in around...

1121
00:58:23,587 --> 00:58:26,372
Well, I don't know.
You see, my father owns the--

1122
00:58:26,415 --> 00:58:28,505
[woman] Family money.
Well, that means

1123
00:58:28,766 --> 00:58:30,855
your capital's been working
for you for a long time.

1124
00:58:31,203 --> 00:58:34,989
Now, exactly how many years
has your family been buying

1125
00:58:35,033 --> 00:58:36,817
-and selling antiquities?
-Well, I guess...

1126
00:58:36,861 --> 00:58:39,603
Isn't this wedding announcementa little sudden?

1127
00:58:39,907 --> 00:58:41,213
You've always
been very adamant

1128
00:58:41,561 --> 00:58:43,389
about being
the independent woman.

1129
00:58:43,911 --> 00:58:46,305
Well, Betty, when the right mancame along,

1130
00:58:46,566 --> 00:58:48,350
all I can say is
there's no reason

1131
00:58:48,394 --> 00:58:50,527
to let my silly pride
stand in the way.

1132
00:58:50,918 --> 00:58:53,573
I must admit,
I am looking forward to a man

1133
00:58:54,139 --> 00:58:56,533
-dominating my life.
-Oh, really?

1134
00:58:56,924 --> 00:58:59,536
Could you tell us
who this Mr. Wonderful is?

1135
00:58:59,971 --> 00:59:02,060
-Bobby Delaney.
-Oh.

1136
00:59:02,582 --> 00:59:05,237
And where is the wedding
ceremony being held?

1137
00:59:05,759 --> 00:59:07,892
Oh, it's being held at his
parent's antique shop,

1138
00:59:08,414 --> 00:59:09,981
in the village, this afternoon.

1139
00:59:10,459 --> 00:59:13,985
Thank you, Rachel. Well, there you have it, folks.

1140
00:59:14,333 --> 00:59:15,552
Hollywood most eligible...

1141
00:59:15,595 --> 00:59:17,336
-I'll pack?
-I'll call a cab.

1142
00:59:18,598 --> 00:59:20,557
[Bobby] We'll be in my place
in a minute.

1143
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:23,211
-You don't need to show me---I don't have a minute to spare.

1144
00:59:23,255 --> 00:59:26,040
I have a future to program.
Our future.

1145
00:59:26,084 --> 00:59:27,564
[Bobby] Oh.

1146
00:59:27,607 --> 00:59:30,088
Pass me the home
investment brochure.

1147
00:59:30,131 --> 00:59:31,742
It should be in the side
pocket there.

1148
00:59:32,438 --> 00:59:33,439
Ooh.

1149
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,007
Boy, that's neat.

1150
00:59:36,616 --> 00:59:38,749
The world at our fingertips
wherever we go.

1151
00:59:38,966 --> 00:59:42,143
-[chuckles]
-The home investment brochure.

1152
00:59:42,187 --> 00:59:44,232
-Please. Please.
-Uh, I'm looking.

1153
00:59:44,276 --> 00:59:47,453
-I'm looking.
-Oh. Quickly. Oh.

1154
00:59:57,681 --> 01:00:00,640
In two years, we'll haveour second home in The Hamptons.

1155
01:00:02,511 --> 01:00:03,774
This is it.

1156
01:00:04,383 --> 01:00:06,472
Ooh. This looks like
a job for me.

1157
01:00:08,692 --> 01:00:09,823
[shop bell dings]

1158
01:00:10,824 --> 01:00:14,001
[gasps]Oh, Bobby, this place is heaven.

1159
01:00:14,306 --> 01:00:16,743
It's an absolute mess.
It doesn't look like anybody

1160
01:00:16,787 --> 01:00:18,615
has done an ounce
of bookwork in years.

1161
01:00:18,658 --> 01:00:20,442
Well, I know some has been done.

1162
01:00:20,486 --> 01:00:22,662
-I mean, for tax purposes and---Your tax returns,

1163
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:24,925
-can I see them?
-Sure.

1164
01:00:24,969 --> 01:00:26,840
But wouldn't you like to go
upstairs for a few minutes,

1165
01:00:27,188 --> 01:00:29,016
stretch out a while,
talk about money market

1166
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:31,497
-funds, bonds, facts?
-Later. Later, darling. Later.

1167
01:00:31,758 --> 01:00:34,195
I'll set up the computer.
You go get the tax returns.

1168
01:00:34,239 --> 01:00:35,632
Uh, they're upstairs.

1169
01:00:35,675 --> 01:00:37,459
[woman] Well, then I'll just
make myself comfortable.

1170
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:38,722
I'll be right back.

1171
01:00:45,337 --> 01:00:46,730
[snores]

1172
01:01:07,228 --> 01:01:08,882
-Oh, God.
-[Stella snores]

1173
01:01:14,018 --> 01:01:16,411
I hope you're not getting
too comfortable,

1174
01:01:16,455 --> 01:01:17,761
because I have this sort of...
[gasps]

1175
01:01:19,023 --> 01:01:20,459
What did you say?

1176
01:01:20,502 --> 01:01:23,027
Uh, well, uh, I thinkwe better do this another time.

1177
01:01:23,070 --> 01:01:24,985
Oh, no, no.
The sooner the better.

1178
01:01:25,029 --> 01:01:27,074
Give me those returns,
let me set the books straight.

1179
01:01:27,118 --> 01:01:29,686
I'm not sure we should be goingthrough all my father's stuff.

1180
01:01:29,729 --> 01:01:32,340
Oh, wow! Oh, Bobby,
this is going to be a cinch.

1181
01:01:32,384 --> 01:01:33,690
Get me the ledgers, honey.

1182
01:01:33,951 --> 01:01:36,040
I'm going to make usone rich husband and wife team.

1183
01:01:36,083 --> 01:01:37,128
Kiss me.

1184
01:01:37,781 --> 01:01:39,217
The ledgers. The ledgers.

1185
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:41,001
Um, here's another.

1186
01:01:41,045 --> 01:01:43,047
Oh, Bobby, you're the greatest
lover I've ever had.

1187
01:01:43,090 --> 01:01:45,832
-More, more ledgers. More!
-Uh, how about sales list?

1188
01:01:45,876 --> 01:01:47,486
Oh, bring them here.
Bring them here.

1189
01:01:48,226 --> 01:01:49,880
Oh. Oh, Bobby.

1190
01:01:50,402 --> 01:01:52,534
Oh, Bobby, you're the greatest
and most passionate man

1191
01:01:52,578 --> 01:01:54,711
I've ever met.
More, more, more, more.

1192
01:01:55,581 --> 01:01:57,409
-What are these?
-Uh, bills.

1193
01:01:57,626 --> 01:01:59,237
-Have they been paid?
-No.

1194
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,761
[woman] Oh, unpaid bills
wanting my money,

1195
01:02:01,805 --> 01:02:05,765
wanting my attention.
Oh, Bobby. [moans]

1196
01:02:06,070 --> 01:02:10,074
Well, Dancee, old girl.
I'm through with this one.

1197
01:02:11,118 --> 01:02:12,554
[Dancee] Who's an old girl?

1198
01:02:12,598 --> 01:02:14,731
Oh, sorry.
Didn't mean that.

1199
01:02:14,774 --> 01:02:17,124
If anything's old,
it's this true love shit.

1200
01:02:17,168 --> 01:02:18,560
-[woman] Wow.
-Put me down, boys.

1201
01:02:18,604 --> 01:02:20,127
[woman] Oh, Bobby.
This is...

1202
01:02:20,432 --> 01:02:23,304
Here, let yourselves in.
I'll be back in, uh...

1203
01:02:23,609 --> 01:02:25,480
How should I know?

1204
01:02:25,524 --> 01:02:27,091
Right. How should you know?

1205
01:02:27,308 --> 01:02:29,397
Why don't you guys go back
and get comfortable?

1206
01:02:29,441 --> 01:02:31,051
Get out of those
leather loincloths.

1207
01:02:31,095 --> 01:02:32,226
-You must be hot in them.
-[keyboard clacking]

1208
01:02:32,270 --> 01:02:33,358
[clicks fingers]

1209
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:36,100
If this isn't a lesson you can'tjudge a book by its cover,

1210
01:02:36,143 --> 01:02:38,929
-I don't know what is.
-She's going to make us rich.

1211
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:41,758
Oh, better you buy a racehorse.You know, my couple of friends,

1212
01:02:41,975 --> 01:02:44,456
-we just---Did you remember the poem yet?

1213
01:02:44,848 --> 01:02:46,066
No. I've been busy.

1214
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:48,547
Yeah. Leather loincloths,
right?

1215
01:02:49,156 --> 01:02:51,115
Right. So what's the trouble?

1216
01:02:51,158 --> 01:02:54,118
-[woman] More, more ledgers.
-Stella's passed out upstairs.

1217
01:02:54,335 --> 01:02:55,902
Isabelle's in the kitchen
cooking.

1218
01:02:55,946 --> 01:02:57,774
-Ooh.
-I don't know where Rachel is,

1219
01:02:57,817 --> 01:02:59,601
but I'm sure
she's headed here.

1220
01:02:59,645 --> 01:03:02,082
And this one,
with that computer of hers,

1221
01:03:02,126 --> 01:03:05,607
has probably already planned outthe cost of my funeral!

1222
01:03:05,651 --> 01:03:07,218
And you ask
what's the trouble?

1223
01:03:07,827 --> 01:03:09,089
How about if we go out

1224
01:03:09,133 --> 01:03:11,091
-and look for the girl--
-No more girls!

1225
01:03:11,135 --> 01:03:14,791
Not until you unzap the four
actively pursuing my body.

1226
01:03:15,139 --> 01:03:17,184
-[knocking on door]
-Oh, great. That must be Joan.

1227
01:03:17,228 --> 01:03:18,533
What do I do?

1228
01:03:18,577 --> 01:03:20,492
Well, be glad that she's not
after your body.

1229
01:03:21,188 --> 01:03:22,799
But then again
what's one more?

1230
01:03:22,842 --> 01:03:24,148
-[grunts]
-Uh...

1231
01:03:24,539 --> 01:03:27,368
camel heads and camel humps...Uh, making the wise men a grump.

1232
01:03:27,673 --> 01:03:29,849
Uh, I can't undo my mind--
Uh, at all time.

1233
01:03:29,893 --> 01:03:31,895
-Oh, I don't know.
-Dancee, do something!

1234
01:03:32,504 --> 01:03:34,332
Uh, ready or not, here goes.

1235
01:03:35,899 --> 01:03:37,901
-Hi, Joan. How are you doing?
-[shop bell chimes]

1236
01:03:38,336 --> 01:03:41,165
Bobby, you look terrible.
What have you been doing?

1237
01:03:42,253 --> 01:03:44,690
-Um...
-[woman] Oh, wow!

1238
01:03:45,038 --> 01:03:48,433
Oh, memos, bills, sales.

1239
01:03:48,737 --> 01:03:50,522
-Who's the naked girl?
-Who?

1240
01:03:51,088 --> 01:03:53,351
-And what is she doing?
-[woman] I need more.

1241
01:03:53,394 --> 01:03:54,874
The books.
She's doing the books.

1242
01:03:55,179 --> 01:03:56,920
Let's go outside,
and I'll try to explain.

1243
01:03:57,921 --> 01:04:00,706
[laughs]
Oh, good luck, kiddo.

1244
01:04:01,272 --> 01:04:03,317
Do you remember the bottle
we unpacked the day

1245
01:04:03,361 --> 01:04:04,231
before yesterday?

1246
01:04:05,015 --> 01:04:06,494
I thought you were gonna tell meabout the nude girl in there

1247
01:04:06,538 --> 01:04:08,148
-doing the books?
-I am,

1248
01:04:08,192 --> 01:04:10,716
but it started with the bottle.There was something inside it.

1249
01:04:10,759 --> 01:04:11,891
-What?
-[car horn honks]

1250
01:04:11,935 --> 01:04:12,936
A genie.

1251
01:04:13,719 --> 01:04:14,894
[car horn honks]

1252
01:04:20,247 --> 01:04:21,945
-Bobby.
-[chuckles]

1253
01:04:22,467 --> 01:04:24,643
Bobby, darling.
I missed you so much.

1254
01:04:24,904 --> 01:04:25,992
Yeah.

1255
01:04:26,036 --> 01:04:27,689
Dexter, how did he get
out of there?

1256
01:04:27,733 --> 01:04:29,735
-I don't know.
-Tighter knots next time.

1257
01:04:30,083 --> 01:04:32,738
-Oh, Bobby, darling.
-Rachel Richards?

1258
01:04:33,608 --> 01:04:35,349
Quick, Dexter.
Get the stuff set up.

1259
01:04:35,393 --> 01:04:36,437
For what?

1260
01:04:36,481 --> 01:04:38,918
[indistinct chatter]

1261
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,399
Ms. Richards,
so is this the lucky man?

1262
01:04:41,747 --> 01:04:43,575
Yes. Bobby Delaney.

1263
01:04:43,792 --> 01:04:45,751
Won't he make
a wonderful groom?

1264
01:04:45,794 --> 01:04:47,187
-Groom?
-Groom?

1265
01:04:47,231 --> 01:04:48,754
What time is the ceremony,
Ms. Richards?

1266
01:04:49,102 --> 01:04:50,756
Oh, soon.
Very soon.

1267
01:04:51,104 --> 01:04:52,889
Give me ten minutes to set up.
Come, Dexter.

1268
01:04:52,932 --> 01:04:54,281
[reporter] Ms. Richards.

1269
01:04:54,325 --> 01:04:55,761
-Please one more question.
-[Rachel] Later. Bye.

1270
01:04:55,804 --> 01:04:57,937
-What is going on?
-[chuckles]

1271
01:04:57,981 --> 01:04:59,896
[reporter] Mr. Delaney,
how does it feel to be

1272
01:04:59,939 --> 01:05:01,549
-a chosen one?
-Chosen one what?

1273
01:05:01,593 --> 01:05:02,899
Chosen by Rachel Richards

1274
01:05:02,942 --> 01:05:04,291
to be her lawfully
wedded husband.

1275
01:05:04,683 --> 01:05:06,076
[chuckles] Excuse me,

1276
01:05:06,337 --> 01:05:07,904
but there's been
a major mistake.

1277
01:05:07,947 --> 01:05:09,296
Joan, won't you
take care of everything?

1278
01:05:10,341 --> 01:05:12,473
And who are you?
So, who are you? His sister?

1279
01:05:12,517 --> 01:05:14,475
No. I am not his sister.

1280
01:05:14,823 --> 01:05:17,000
Bobby, you can't leave me
out here like this.

1281
01:05:17,348 --> 01:05:19,524
Don't you set foot
into this shop.

1282
01:05:20,742 --> 01:05:22,788
I know we should never
have left him alone.

1283
01:05:23,136 --> 01:05:24,355
Never again.

1284
01:05:24,398 --> 01:05:25,922
[driver] Hey, you folks
hear Rachel Richards

1285
01:05:25,965 --> 01:05:28,272
-just got hitched?
-Yes. We've heard.

1286
01:05:28,315 --> 01:05:31,449
Uh, roses are red,
violets are blue.

1287
01:05:31,797 --> 01:05:34,756
-Oh, Bobby. Bobby.
-What's the matter with her?

1288
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:38,238
Uh, Dancee, do something.
Uh, prove that you're here.

1289
01:05:38,282 --> 01:05:40,023
-Who are you talking to?
-Dancee, the genie.

1290
01:05:40,371 --> 01:05:42,939
-What do you want me to do?
-I don't know. Something!

1291
01:05:43,504 --> 01:05:45,028
Uh, tell her to watch the shelf.

1292
01:05:45,506 --> 01:05:46,943
-Watch that shelf.
-Why?

1293
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:49,771
[glass shattering]

1294
01:05:49,815 --> 01:05:52,122
Dancee, my folks
are gonna kill me!

1295
01:05:53,645 --> 01:05:55,255
-How did you do that?
-Oh, Bobby.

1296
01:05:55,299 --> 01:05:56,996
Bobby, I love you.

1297
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,520
-Do something about her.
-What do you want me to do?

1298
01:05:59,999 --> 01:06:02,959
Not you. It's what
I'm trying to tell you.

1299
01:06:03,002 --> 01:06:04,569
Uh, the bottle,
there's this genie.

1300
01:06:05,091 --> 01:06:07,050
She's right here.
She broke those vases.

1301
01:06:07,354 --> 01:06:08,703
Well, she can't see me.

1302
01:06:08,747 --> 01:06:10,531
-Shut up!
-What?

1303
01:06:10,575 --> 01:06:14,013
No. not you. Oh, God.
I think I'm going crazy.

1304
01:06:14,057 --> 01:06:15,972
Oh, you're not going crazy.

1305
01:06:16,015 --> 01:06:17,582
You just--
You just need a little rest.

1306
01:06:18,104 --> 01:06:19,540
Do something, Dancee.

1307
01:06:19,888 --> 01:06:21,455
Do your genie shit.

1308
01:06:21,499 --> 01:06:25,329
Bobby, more, more, more ledgers.More papers, more bills, Bobby.

1309
01:06:25,372 --> 01:06:27,635
You relax and I'll see
if I can find some upstairs.

1310
01:06:27,679 --> 01:06:28,593
[Bobby] No! Oh, no!

1311
01:06:33,685 --> 01:06:35,208
I'm ready for you, Bobby.

1312
01:06:36,775 --> 01:06:38,429
Bobby, are you all right?

1313
01:06:38,777 --> 01:06:42,041
Bobby, baby, I've been
waiting so long for you.

1314
01:06:42,085 --> 01:06:44,000
Stella, what are you doing here?

1315
01:06:44,043 --> 01:06:45,653
She was just taking
a little nap.

1316
01:06:45,697 --> 01:06:47,829
Breakfast should be
ready soon, darling.

1317
01:06:47,873 --> 01:06:49,875
Goodness, guests?
I better prepare more.

1318
01:06:51,703 --> 01:06:53,139
-Who is she?
-Who's that?

1319
01:06:53,183 --> 01:06:55,141
-The cook.
-Bobby, what is going on here?

1320
01:06:55,185 --> 01:06:56,273
-Yeah.
-Uh, nothing.

1321
01:06:56,316 --> 01:06:57,752
Uh, figments,
that's what they are.

1322
01:06:57,796 --> 01:06:58,927
Figments of our imagination.

1323
01:07:01,930 --> 01:07:05,064
[indistinct chatter]

1324
01:07:10,635 --> 01:07:12,245
[woman] Oh, Bobby. Bobby.
I love you, Bobby.

1325
01:07:13,072 --> 01:07:15,074
-Oh!
-Ow. What's your hurry?

1326
01:07:15,118 --> 01:07:17,337
My hurry is that
if I don't get out of here,

1327
01:07:17,381 --> 01:07:19,687
I'm gonna get lynched,
and it'll be your fault.

1328
01:07:19,731 --> 01:07:21,341
I take responsibility
for nothing.

1329
01:07:21,385 --> 01:07:23,169
I do my best.
That's all I can do.

1330
01:07:23,213 --> 01:07:26,433
Well, you better do better,
because if I get killed,

1331
01:07:26,477 --> 01:07:30,394
you'll have to start all over
with your gladiator boyfriend.

1332
01:07:30,437 --> 01:07:31,569
Okay. I'll...

1333
01:07:32,439 --> 01:07:35,051
-Are you this guy, Delaney?
-Uh, no. I mean, I don't know.

1334
01:07:35,094 --> 01:07:36,574
Uh, I never met him.

1335
01:07:37,183 --> 01:07:38,402
Help me. Help me.

1336
01:07:38,924 --> 01:07:39,925
Oh, no!

1337
01:07:40,708 --> 01:07:42,928
[woman] Oh, Bobby, come back.
Bobby.

1338
01:07:45,931 --> 01:07:48,629
-[gunshots]
-Oh. Help!

1339
01:07:49,935 --> 01:07:51,763
I want my genie!

1340
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:52,981
[gunshot]

1341
01:07:53,286 --> 01:07:55,245
Oh, I think I have it.
I think I have it!

1342
01:07:56,768 --> 01:07:59,075
Bobby, Bobby,
I need more ledgers,

1343
01:07:59,118 --> 01:08:00,467
more sales print.

1344
01:08:00,511 --> 01:08:02,469
I think I've got it.
I think I've got it.

1345
01:08:02,513 --> 01:08:04,254
Well, say it or do it now!

1346
01:08:04,297 --> 01:08:06,082
What do you want us
to say or do?

1347
01:08:06,299 --> 01:08:09,302
Yeah. What do you want from us?A ménage a trois?

1348
01:08:09,650 --> 01:08:12,088
The answer to this confusion
is in the heart.

1349
01:08:13,437 --> 01:08:16,527
The unzapping and eliminating
of these tarts.

1350
01:08:17,223 --> 01:08:20,574
It's not nice to keep
your master waiting.

1351
01:08:20,618 --> 01:08:21,488
Don't stop.

1352
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:23,490
Oh, I love that outfit.

1353
01:08:24,143 --> 01:08:25,188
[Bobby] Dancee...

1354
01:08:25,536 --> 01:08:27,973
-Who are these females?
-[Bobby] Uh, friends.

1355
01:08:28,234 --> 01:08:29,453
Friends of the family.

1356
01:08:29,714 --> 01:08:32,978
A wiggle and a shake,
uh, a jiggle and a roar...

1357
01:08:33,326 --> 01:08:35,111
One more for breakfast.

1358
01:08:35,546 --> 01:08:38,984
Bobby, these are all girls.
What is the meaning of this?

1359
01:08:39,506 --> 01:08:40,681
[all] Yeah.

1360
01:08:40,986 --> 01:08:41,987
Uh...

1361
01:08:42,509 --> 01:08:46,470
And release these false loves
and let true love soar.

1362
01:08:47,166 --> 01:08:48,515
[all] Well...

1363
01:08:48,559 --> 01:08:49,473
[Louie] Isabelle!

1364
01:08:54,304 --> 01:08:57,045
Try again, Dancee.
Try again!

1365
01:08:57,524 --> 01:08:59,309
[glass shattering]

1366
01:08:59,352 --> 01:09:00,658
Watch out!

1367
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:02,529
[gunshot]

1368
01:09:09,014 --> 01:09:11,147
-Is anybody hurt?
-Not yet.

1369
01:09:11,712 --> 01:09:13,497
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

1370
01:09:13,845 --> 01:09:15,977
You mealy-mouthed pussies,
get out of here.

1371
01:09:16,021 --> 01:09:19,024
I'm not going anywhere
without my boyfriend!

1372
01:09:19,067 --> 01:09:22,201
[grunts] You can't talk to me
that way, woman.

1373
01:09:22,245 --> 01:09:25,291
And he's not your boyfriend.
He's my fiancé.

1374
01:09:25,335 --> 01:09:27,815
He's not your anything.
He's my slave.

1375
01:09:27,859 --> 01:09:29,513
Oh, get out of here!

1376
01:09:29,556 --> 01:09:33,038
[grunting]

1377
01:09:34,779 --> 01:09:37,216
Bobby, please do something.
They're your friends.

1378
01:09:37,521 --> 01:09:39,305
Think, Dancee. Think.

1379
01:09:39,349 --> 01:09:40,959
Ooh. I am thinking, Master.

1380
01:09:41,568 --> 01:09:43,570
Ooh, but I love
a good cat fight.

1381
01:09:44,223 --> 01:09:46,356
Get them, girls.
Oh, scratch her eyes out.

1382
01:09:46,617 --> 01:09:49,533
-[indistinct chatter]
-Oh, yes, yes. Me, me, me, me.

1383
01:09:49,576 --> 01:09:51,665
I've been a naughty boy.
Oh, give it to me.

1384
01:09:51,709 --> 01:09:53,841
Hit me, please.
Oh, yes, yes.

1385
01:09:53,885 --> 01:09:56,322
Hurt me. Hurt me.
Oh, God. Calm your waitress.

1386
01:09:56,366 --> 01:09:58,019
[indistinct chatter]

1387
01:09:58,063 --> 01:09:59,804
Oh, hurt me. Abuse me.
Oh, yes.

1388
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:03,590
[screaming
and grunting continues]

1389
01:10:07,986 --> 01:10:09,553
You bitch!

1390
01:10:10,118 --> 01:10:13,121
Let go of me, you bitch!
Let go of me!

1391
01:10:14,079 --> 01:10:15,646
Get out of here!

1392
01:10:15,994 --> 01:10:18,823
[screaming]

1393
01:10:23,915 --> 01:10:26,047
Go sit on my face.
Leap on it.

1394
01:10:26,091 --> 01:10:27,397
Leap on my face, baby.

1395
01:10:27,919 --> 01:10:30,574
[screaming and grunting]

1396
01:10:31,531 --> 01:10:33,925
-Where are you, Isabelle?-[woman] More, more, more, more.

1397
01:10:34,447 --> 01:10:37,320
[screaming and grunting]

1398
01:10:39,583 --> 01:10:42,586
Wow. What a body.

1399
01:10:43,587 --> 01:10:45,806
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

1400
01:10:46,459 --> 01:10:48,244
Master, I can't seemto connect with anything.

1401
01:10:48,418 --> 01:10:51,247
Dancee, didn't you remember
something yesterday?

1402
01:10:51,290 --> 01:10:54,337
-What was it?
-Oh, yeah. True love.

1403
01:10:56,121 --> 01:10:57,992
Real love will break the spell.

1404
01:10:58,036 --> 01:11:01,257
Isabelle! Isabelle. Isabelle.

1405
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:03,389
The genie.
Give me my genie.

1406
01:11:03,433 --> 01:11:04,825
Are you Delaney?

1407
01:11:04,869 --> 01:11:06,610
-Shit!
-Asshole!

1408
01:11:06,871 --> 01:11:08,699
[groans] Hey. Hey.

1409
01:11:11,963 --> 01:11:13,791
[screams]

1410
01:11:13,834 --> 01:11:15,358
[groaning]

1411
01:11:16,359 --> 01:11:17,621
Here.

1412
01:11:18,361 --> 01:11:20,276
Oh, have you seen...

1413
01:11:21,364 --> 01:11:22,626
[Bobby's mom gasps]

1414
01:11:24,018 --> 01:11:28,284
Tell Bobby I need more papers,
more ledgers. More, more.

1415
01:11:29,067 --> 01:11:32,505
[indistinct chatter]

1416
01:11:39,338 --> 01:11:40,731
Oh, my God! Isabelle!

1417
01:11:41,209 --> 01:11:44,387
[indistinct chatter]

1418
01:11:47,825 --> 01:11:49,392
What is the meaning of this?

1419
01:11:50,349 --> 01:11:52,656
Bobby, what is going on?

1420
01:11:53,004 --> 01:11:54,614
[indistinct chatter]

1421
01:11:54,658 --> 01:11:55,311
I got it!

1422
01:11:56,399 --> 01:11:57,400
Let's see.

1423
01:11:58,575 --> 01:12:01,839
When the heart expresses
what is truly feels

1424
01:12:02,361 --> 01:12:05,233
there is no need for wishes
and deals.

1425
01:12:06,409 --> 01:12:09,325
If in my master's life
true love exists,

1426
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:12,415
let him find it waiting
in the morning mist,

1427
01:12:13,546 --> 01:12:17,028
and eliminate false loves
not true today,

1428
01:12:18,203 --> 01:12:21,728
and allow the real love
to find the way.

1429
01:12:23,948 --> 01:12:25,036
Well?

1430
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:30,346
Bobby, what happened?
Why did they all stop?

1431
01:12:31,434 --> 01:12:33,436
I'm really sorry
about all this, Joan.

1432
01:12:34,262 --> 01:12:35,525
Was it the genie?

1433
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:39,703
-Dexter, what am I doing here?
-Uh, you're gonna marry him.

1434
01:12:40,443 --> 01:12:43,576
Ha! Marry this nerd?
You've got to be kidding.

1435
01:12:44,055 --> 01:12:46,362
Rachel Richards would never
lower herself

1436
01:12:46,405 --> 01:12:48,233
-that low.
-Ow!

1437
01:12:48,276 --> 01:12:51,367
-Come on. Let me hear your pain.-[Dexter screams]

1438
01:12:51,410 --> 01:12:54,021
I thought the guy I threw out
the window was Delaney.

1439
01:12:54,065 --> 01:12:56,372
I don't know.
What happened?

1440
01:12:57,068 --> 01:12:59,113
You was in here cooking
and cleaning for that...

1441
01:12:59,157 --> 01:13:00,550
That little weasel.

1442
01:13:01,072 --> 01:13:03,727
Never would I be
unfaithful to you, Louie,

1443
01:13:04,467 --> 01:13:07,470
especially not for that
sad excuse of a man.

1444
01:13:09,428 --> 01:13:10,386
Ow!

1445
01:13:10,734 --> 01:13:12,083
[groans]

1446
01:13:12,866 --> 01:13:15,086
What the fuck is going on?

1447
01:13:15,434 --> 01:13:17,523
Did you get me drunk
or something, Bobby?

1448
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:18,785
No, Stella.

1449
01:13:19,264 --> 01:13:22,180
[sobbing] Take advantage
of an innocent little girl.

1450
01:13:22,789 --> 01:13:26,184
You ought to be ashamed
of yourself, you pervert.

1451
01:13:26,532 --> 01:13:28,491
-[thud]
-[groans]

1452
01:13:31,189 --> 01:13:32,799
You have embarrassed us, Bobby.

1453
01:13:34,061 --> 01:13:36,542
There will be no second home
in The Hamptons for us,

1454
01:13:36,586 --> 01:13:38,849
you, you-- Whoever you are!

1455
01:13:39,110 --> 01:13:40,807
[groans]

1456
01:13:40,851 --> 01:13:44,115
Bobby, this is--
This is terrible.

1457
01:13:44,811 --> 01:13:46,770
-[sobs]
-See what you've done?

1458
01:13:47,205 --> 01:13:48,989
I think you better go
for a while

1459
01:13:49,337 --> 01:13:52,297
and let your mother calm down,
and me too.

1460
01:13:55,518 --> 01:13:59,609
Dad, it was all just
a big misunderstanding.

1461
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,045
And when you get back,

1462
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:03,439
I expect you to clean up
this entire mess.

1463
01:14:04,788 --> 01:14:05,789
Yes, Dad.

1464
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:24,547
-Is she here now?
-Yeah.

1465
01:14:25,504 --> 01:14:28,507
Joan, this is Dancee.
Dancee, this is Joan.

1466
01:14:28,812 --> 01:14:30,814
-Hi, Dancee.
-Hi, honey.

1467
01:14:31,815 --> 01:14:33,033
She says hi.

1468
01:14:36,515 --> 01:14:39,649
You know,
I'm really sorry about this.

1469
01:14:40,345 --> 01:14:42,042
Yeah. Don't be sorry, Dancee.

1470
01:14:42,608 --> 01:14:44,349
[Joan] Why is she sorry?

1471
01:14:44,392 --> 01:14:46,177
[Bobby] My last wish
was to find love.

1472
01:14:47,134 --> 01:14:49,049
That's why all those girls
were after me.

1473
01:14:49,702 --> 01:14:52,226
Only Dancee couldn't remember
how to unzap them all.

1474
01:14:52,270 --> 01:14:54,664
-[Joan] But she did.
-[Bobby] Yeah.

1475
01:14:55,926 --> 01:14:58,668
-It's a beautiful poem.
-What did it say?

1476
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:01,671
That true love
will find its way.

1477
01:15:04,064 --> 01:15:07,372
And that's why the spell
was broken on all those girls,

1478
01:15:08,591 --> 01:15:12,203
because true love was there,
right there in that room.

1479
01:15:13,726 --> 01:15:14,510
Me?

1480
01:15:15,685 --> 01:15:17,382
Congratulations, honey.

1481
01:15:19,297 --> 01:15:21,517
Dancee.
Dancee, don't leave.

1482
01:15:22,909 --> 01:15:24,215
[Joan] Where is she going?

1483
01:15:24,868 --> 01:15:26,043
Away.

1484
01:15:26,739 --> 01:15:28,611
I have so much to thank you for.

1485
01:15:29,046 --> 01:15:30,221
So thank me.

1486
01:15:30,874 --> 01:15:31,962
Thanks, Dancee.

1487
01:15:32,658 --> 01:15:34,442
You tell her
thanks for me too.

1488
01:15:35,095 --> 01:15:36,401
She hears you.

1489
01:15:37,184 --> 01:15:40,840
Good luck to you both.
And smile.

1490
01:15:40,884 --> 01:15:42,712
You have your whole life
ahead of you.

1491
01:15:42,755 --> 01:15:44,540
She wants us to smile.

1492
01:15:47,934 --> 01:15:49,414
That's better.

1493
01:15:50,415 --> 01:15:51,547
[Bobby] She's gone.

1494
01:15:53,418 --> 01:15:54,550
I'm sorry.

1495
01:15:56,595 --> 01:15:58,466
There's no need to be sorry.

1496
01:15:59,467 --> 01:16:01,426
Dancee, wouldn't want it
that way.

1497
01:16:02,296 --> 01:16:06,562
We got to celebrate.Party. Tell the world about us.

1498
01:16:14,918 --> 01:16:16,659
-[wind howling]
-The bottle.

1499
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,574
The bottle.
Finally, the bottle.

1500
01:16:20,271 --> 01:16:21,925
Come to me.
Come to me.

1501
01:16:22,142 --> 01:16:23,970
Come to me, genie.

1502
01:16:24,492 --> 01:16:27,147
Come to me. Come to me.
Come to me.

1503
01:16:27,713 --> 01:16:30,934
[wind howling]

1504
01:16:58,483 --> 01:17:00,964
Have a nice 2,000 years, Foley.

1505
01:17:05,664 --> 01:17:09,973
[Foley] Help! Help! Help!

1506
01:17:12,976 --> 01:17:14,151
Bye-bye.

1507
01:17:14,717 --> 01:17:17,850
Look out, New York.
Dancee is coming through.
