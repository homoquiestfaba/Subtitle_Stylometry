00:02:13,065 --> 00:02:14,896
[Man] All right, people.
This is Agent Ford.

2
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:19,666
We're almost there.
Let's make it count.

3
00:02:19,738 --> 00:02:22,400
This is a surveillance op.
We do not want this guy.

4
00:02:22,474 --> 00:02:25,841
I repeat. Do not let him
I.D. You. He's just the driver.

5
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:28,311
Eagle One.
Gimme a heads-up.

6
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,110
Eagle One has
target in sight.

7
00:02:31,183 --> 00:02:33,674
Target moving east
on Third. Over.

8
00:02:33,752 --> 00:02:35,686
Roger, Eagle One.

9
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:41,893
C.P. Is following.
Packages are right there in back.

10
00:03:09,888 --> 00:03:12,789
[Ford] Eagle One, you copy
the black Mustang?

11
00:03:14,526 --> 00:03:17,927
[Eagle One] Roger, C.P.
There's a second one closing in also.

12
00:03:23,268 --> 00:03:24,895
Shit!

13
00:03:29,241 --> 00:03:31,300
[Ford]
He's made us. Maintain pursuit.

14
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,811
Repeat. Maintain pursuit.

15
00:03:36,415 --> 00:03:39,509
Get the plates
on those Mustangs!

16
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:46,483
Do not lose that driver.
He's our only link to the buyers.

- F.B.I.! Freeze! Freeze!
- Don't shoot! A.T.F.!

20
00:04:56,595 --> 00:05:00,531
- Agent McClaren, A.T.F.
- What the hell's A.T.F. Doin'
on an F.B.I. Operation?

21
00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:03,727
- And you are?
- Allen Ford.

22
00:05:03,802 --> 00:05:08,501
I'm sensing a lot of hostility here.
There's no reason to get defensive.

23
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:12,476
You've got yourself a dead driver
and a cute little shipment of guns!

24
00:05:12,544 --> 00:05:15,536
But ya don't have the seller,
and ya don't have the buyer!

25
00:05:15,614 --> 00:05:18,174
All you've done is shown
the man we're on to him.

26
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,741
A.T.F. What does that
stand for, anyway?

27
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:25,153
Alcohol, Tobacco
and Fuckups?

28
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:27,818
Definitely a lot of hostility.

Hey, Tommy, you're takin' a little
longer than you should with that!

33
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,390
Let's go! Let's go!

34
00:06:03,595 --> 00:06:06,086
Come on. Come on!

35
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:08,395
- Come on! Let's go!
- Find out what that problem was?

36
00:06:08,467 --> 00:06:11,459
Supposed to be 3/16ths!

37
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:16,873
Jeff, do I have to remind you
what happened last week?

38
00:06:16,942 --> 00:06:20,241
Come on, Billy.
Get a mop and clean that up.

39
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,805
- Crews!
- Yeah.

40
00:06:23,882 --> 00:06:25,816
I need this one today.

41
00:06:25,884 --> 00:06:28,614
[Man]
Manuel, main-end rod bearing!

42
00:06:28,687 --> 00:06:32,350
- Mr. Cutler said tomorrow.
- I don't give a shit
what Mr. Cutler said.

43
00:06:32,424 --> 00:06:35,587
I got a bunch of loads going out.
I need this one today.

44
00:06:37,796 --> 00:06:40,492
- [Mutters]
- Is that a problem?

45
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:46,061
Uh, no, sir... Just I told my wife I'd
pick my daughter up from school and...

46
00:06:46,138 --> 00:06:48,834
Well, that's real fatherly of you,
but if you want to keep this job,

47
00:06:48,907 --> 00:06:51,637
you're gonna stay here
till it's finished.

48
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:55,373
- Hey, Greg, can you give me
a hand over here?
- If you need it, it'll be done.

49
00:07:01,353 --> 00:07:04,686
- Mr. Cutler wanted to see me?
- He's expecting you, Jack.

50
00:07:04,756 --> 00:07:07,384
- [Knocking]
- Come in!

00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:11,862
[Phone Ringing]

52
00:07:14,633 --> 00:07:18,501
- Yes, sir. You wanted to see me?
- Sit down, Crews.

53
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:29,270
- You've been with me, what, Crews,
three weeks now?
- Yes, sir.

54
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:31,714
Says here, you used
to drive a truck.

55
00:07:31,783 --> 00:07:35,310
I think, uh, "used to drive"
is the operative phrase.

56
00:07:35,387 --> 00:07:37,321
Come on, Jack. Don't be so modest. Your
parole officer says you could drive...

57
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:40,051
an ice truck through hell
on the 4th of July.

58
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,389
Bet you miss that life,
don't you?

59
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:46,921
- Being your own boss and
nobody tellin' you what to do.
- Sometimes, I guess.

60
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,967
I bet you miss the money
all the time.

61
00:07:50,802 --> 00:07:54,431
How'd you like a chance
to earn some extra cash?

62
00:07:54,506 --> 00:07:57,475
I got a load I need
brought up from Atlanta.

63
00:07:57,542 --> 00:08:01,501
- Off the books, you know what I mean?
- Sir, if you know I can drive,

64
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,516
you also know that I lost my license
permanently when I went to prison.

65
00:08:05,584 --> 00:08:08,985
The way I see it, you only need
a license if you get pulled over.

66
00:08:09,054 --> 00:08:11,682
You made that Georgia run before,
right? You know how easy it is.

67
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:14,419
It's 15 hours. Nobody even
has to know you're out of town.

68
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:17,053
Not even your parole officer. Nobody.

69
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,495
I don't think so.

70
00:08:21,233 --> 00:08:23,861
I'll tell you
what I'll do, Jack.

71
00:08:23,935 --> 00:08:27,894
I know some people. Do this for me, I
might be able to get your license back.

72
00:08:27,973 --> 00:08:32,171
- Job pays 10 grand.
- I can't do it.

73
00:08:32,244 --> 00:08:35,873
[Laughs]

74
00:08:35,947 --> 00:08:38,745
Why don't you sleep
on it, Jack?

75
00:08:38,817 --> 00:08:42,947
Seein' how much you like your job, I'd
hate to see you make the wrong decision.

76
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:48,025
Why don't you check
with me tomorrow?

77
00:08:56,301 --> 00:08:59,395
- Federal Bureau of Investigation.
- [Woman] D.N.A. Is a match.

78
00:08:59,471 --> 00:09:01,405
[Man]
One moment, I'll check.

79
00:09:01,473 --> 00:09:04,442
Today!
Today.

80
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:07,376
- Excuse me, Holly, is this the file?
- Yes. That's it. Yeah.

81
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:10,210
From now on you'll be working
with A.T.F. On this.

82
00:09:10,282 --> 00:09:13,080
With all due respect,
I know we've had our setbacks,

83
00:09:13,151 --> 00:09:16,712
but the A.T.F. Directly interfered
with our operation.

84
00:09:16,788 --> 00:09:19,951
- What happened was their fault.
- I'm hearing your defensive
voice again.

85
00:09:20,025 --> 00:09:23,290
- I am not being defensive!
- You say that whenever
you're getting defensive, Allen.

86
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:25,296
You want me to be defensive.
All right.

87
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:28,731
You might see yourself
as all over the 6:00 news on this thing,

88
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,826
but the reality is, you're putting
a serious operation at risk.

89
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,667
Now, I'm hearing some very real
masculinity issues.

90
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,800
What the hell's
the matter with you?

91
00:09:37,876 --> 00:09:42,711
We've got a lead on another shipment.
We don't need this interference.

92
00:09:42,781 --> 00:09:45,682
Allen, this is
hardly my call, okay?

93
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:49,983
Coordinate your efforts with Agent
McClaren, and you'll both report to me.

94
00:09:50,055 --> 00:09:53,354
That's the way
it's gonna be!

95
00:09:53,425 --> 00:09:57,396
[Man] I agree with you.
Very little I can do.

- Tracy, dinner!

- Hi. What are we having?
- Only the absolute best, homemade.

98

- Did you wash your hands?
- Yep.

99
00:10:07,372 --> 00:10:09,363
- How's practice?
- Good!

100
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:11,705
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

101
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:15,008
Dad, can you help me
with my foul shots tomorrow?

102
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,538
- We have a game on Friday.
- Yeah. You bet.

I wanted to tell you, but I...

113
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:41,292
thought you should have
some breathing room first.

I just couldn't make ends meet.

you say something? I could've...

117
00:11:54,045 --> 00:11:57,606
You could've what, Jack?
You were inside.

118
00:12:00,385 --> 00:12:03,877
Look, we'll rent a place back in Newark
till we can get back on our feet.

119
00:12:03,955 --> 00:12:07,584
- We'll make it work.
- No. No.

120
00:12:07,659 --> 00:12:10,093
We moved out of Newark,
so Tracy could have a yard...

121
00:12:10,161 --> 00:12:12,959
and go to a school without
metal detectors in the halls.

122
00:12:13,031 --> 00:12:15,022
We are not going back!

I'm not gonna let us lose this house.

Jack, even with what we both
make, we are too far behind.

125
00:12:24,609 --> 00:12:29,376
I was offered
a job today... driving.

126
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:35,813
One load.
Atlanta to here. Cash.

127
00:12:35,887 --> 00:12:39,220
Melanie, I'll make enough
money to get us out of this.

128
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:44,160
The last time you said one
more load then we'd be okay,

129
00:12:44,229 --> 00:12:46,163
we weren't.

130

a damn NASCAR rally.

163
00:15:40,238 --> 00:15:42,172
Did you get
my Sunday throwaways?

164
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,505
- You know, it slipped my mind.
- It slipped your mind?

165
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:48,944
Did you know there's coupons for 50
cents off luncheon meats at Winn-Dixie?

166
00:15:49,013 --> 00:15:52,505
I ask you to do
one simple thing.

167
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:57,421
Mr. Cutler
sent us a driver.

168
00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:01,290
Earl. Jack Crews.

169
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:03,224
You'll have to forgive
Earl's manners.

170
00:16:03,294 --> 00:16:06,752
He was hopin' he'd get to drive.
[Chuckles]

171
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,430
- Uh, I'm not takin' that.
- What?

172
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:14,404
It's brand-spankin' new.

173
00:16:14,472 --> 00:16:16,497
I don't need
that kind of attention.

174
00:16:16,574 --> 00:16:20,977
Junior, come down here
and show Jack Crews a tractor...

175
00:16:21,045 --> 00:16:24,378
that's more to his likin'.

176
00:16:24,449 --> 00:16:26,508
Come on.

177
00:16:29,354 --> 00:16:33,848
I think Mr. Cutler suspects something.
He sent down a new driver.

178
00:16:33,925 --> 00:16:36,723
It don't make a damn bit of difference,
Red. Our deal's with you.

179
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:38,956
I know that.

180
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:42,522
Things are gettin' more complicated now.
I'm gonna need some more cash.

181
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,795
You listen to me.
6:00 tonight with that truck...

182
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:48,100
or cash'll be
the last thing you need.

183
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:53,042
- So, what's it got in it?
- 3406 "Cat," turbo-ed,
four and a quarter,

184
00:16:53,111 --> 00:16:56,672
- Fuller-Eaton ten-speed, pro-shift.
- Got a Jake brake?

185
00:16:56,748 --> 00:16:59,808
Yep.

186
00:16:59,884 --> 00:17:02,444
- How are the brakes?
- New. Put 'em on myself.

187
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:07,958
- And the rubber?
- Almost new. Ain't no recaps.

188
00:17:08,026 --> 00:17:11,189
All right. Fire her up.

189
00:17:26,344 --> 00:17:30,405
- Earl's gonna be riding with ya.
- What do ya mean,
he's gonna be riding with me?

190
00:17:30,481 --> 00:17:34,110
Somebody has to drive
that tractor home.

191
00:17:34,185 --> 00:17:36,881
Right as rain.

192
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,659
Sonny's here.
I guess we can hit it.

193
00:17:45,196 --> 00:17:47,130
You're late.

194
00:17:47,198 --> 00:17:50,895
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
I may be late, but I'm always on time.

195
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:54,336
- Hey, Wes. [Laughs]
- Hey, Earl.

196
00:17:54,405 --> 00:17:57,397
- Who's that?
- He's drivin'.

197
00:17:57,475 --> 00:18:00,342
- Since when?
- Since an hour ago.

198
00:18:00,411 --> 00:18:01,746
- Came down from the top.
- From the top of what?

199
00:18:01,746 --> 00:18:02,610
- Came down from the top.
- From the top of what?

200
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,614
You make him seem like
he's goddamned Moses.

201
00:18:04,682 --> 00:18:08,277
- Don't you take
the Lord's name in vain.
- I'm goddamned sorry.

202
00:18:08,352 --> 00:18:13,016
You gonna be sorry. If you don't like
it, Sonny, you can get out right now.

203
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:17,959
What I don't like is you, him
or anybody else changing the plans
every time I turn around.

204
00:18:18,028 --> 00:18:19,928
That's what I don't like.

205
00:18:19,997 --> 00:18:23,057
- I'm Sonny.
- And I'm Wes.

206
00:18:23,134 --> 00:18:25,534
And I'm Jack Crews.

207

We'll be cruisin' right behind ya.
Cruisin' behind "The Crews."

208
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,633
What do ya mean,
you'll be right behind me?

209
00:18:31,709 --> 00:18:34,576
- [Red] Protection.
- Protection from what?

210
00:18:34,645 --> 00:18:38,809
It's policy. We send
a car with every truck.

211
00:18:40,751 --> 00:18:43,219
Come on. Let's do it.

- This your dog?
- Tiny ain't nobody's dog but his own.

214
00:19:10,881 --> 00:19:13,076
Easy, boy.

215
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:18,053
Toilets. Can you believe it?
Five-gallon flush.

216
00:19:19,356 --> 00:19:24,191
- Wanna look any closer?
- I'm just here to drive.

00:21:03,394 --> 00:21:05,521
I thought
you could drive.

232
00:21:07,765 --> 00:21:09,699
First time.

233
00:21:22,713 --> 00:21:26,012
This driver comin' down,
does that change things?

234
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,643
You're not plannin' on havin' kids,
are ya, Junior?

235
00:21:28,719 --> 00:21:32,211

This is the beginning
of a good song.

270
00:23:45,489 --> 00:23:49,016
See, a good song has to have
a good hook. That's what it's all about.

271

00:29:16,652 --> 00:29:22,557
If people are willing
to kill me to get this load,
I ought to know exactly what they want.

325
00:29:35,671 --> 00:29:39,835
"The gates of Babylon
shall not be shut."

326
00:29:39,909 --> 00:29:42,104
That son of a bitch can drive.

327
00:29:42,178 --> 00:29:45,375
[Red] We're gonna have to work
a little harder to get that load.

328
00:29:45,448 --> 00:29:51,353
- Maybe we ought to give up.
- Junior, never underestimate
the power of prayer.

329
00:29:55,324 --> 00:30:00,921
- [Barking]
- Hey, Tiny. Rough ride, wasn't it, boy?

330
00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:25,953
What a surprise.

331
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:32,386
AK-47, Chinese assault rifles.
Twelve rounds per second.

332
00:30:32,461 --> 00:30:37,489
- One tug on this baby,
and it'll cut you in half.
- Box it up.

333
00:30:48,944 --> 00:30:51,811
- [Man On Phone] Yeah, Frank Cutler.
- Yeah, it's Crews.

334
00:30:51,881 --> 00:30:54,111
Hey, good to hear from ya, Jack.
How's everything?

335
00:30:54,183 --> 00:30:56,879
Well, I did have a little
run-in with your friend, Red.

336
00:30:56,952 --> 00:30:59,079
It seems he's tryin'
to hijack your load.

337
00:30:59,155 --> 00:31:03,819
- Is the load okay?
- You didn't tell me I'd be
hauling illegal artillery.

338
00:31:03,893 --> 00:31:05,827
Well, the truth is, Jack,
if you wanted to know...

339
00:31:05,895 --> 00:31:08,125
what was in the back of
that truck, you would've asked.

340
00:31:08,197 --> 00:31:12,429
The reason I hired you, Crews, is 'cause
I knew you could get the job done.

341
00:31:12,501 --> 00:31:15,436
But if you can't handle Red,
you tell me now.

342
00:31:15,504 --> 00:31:17,495
I want those guns... tonight!

343
00:31:17,573 --> 00:31:19,632
Now, you just go back and get
in that truck and do the job...

344
00:31:19,708 --> 00:31:22,074
I'm paying you to do, because
I don't think your parole officer...

345
00:31:22,144 --> 00:31:24,612
is gonna be nearly as
understanding as I am.

346
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:28,207
- You understand what I'm sayin', Jack?
- I'll do what I have to.

347
00:31:29,885 --> 00:31:32,285
- [Sighs]
- [Phone Beeps]

348
00:31:35,691 --> 00:31:37,716
This guy's
gonna be trouble.

349
00:31:38,794 --> 00:31:41,820
- All right, Tiny.
- They hit us once,

350
00:31:41,897 --> 00:31:44,388
they might try it again.

351
00:31:44,466 --> 00:31:48,027
You know, I was thinkin',
we could switch to l-85.

352
00:31:48,103 --> 00:31:50,731
There's a turnoff
about 20 miles up.

353
00:31:50,806 --> 00:31:54,242
That way, if Red comes back,
we won't be where he thinks we'll be.

354
00:31:55,744 --> 00:32:00,977
- Sonny, you ride with me.
- Let's do it.

355
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:04,884
Crews? Wait a minute!
You think I was in on this?

356
00:32:04,954 --> 00:32:07,855
- Crossed my mind. Yeah.
- I wasn't. I swear.

357
00:32:07,923 --> 00:32:11,154
Red never tells me anything.
You can ask anybody.

358
00:32:11,227 --> 00:32:13,161
Earl, you got that right.

359
00:32:13,229 --> 00:32:16,687
Hey, man, they were
shootin' at me too!

360
00:32:16,765 --> 00:32:19,427
You ever thought about bein'
a professional singer?

361
00:32:20,436 --> 00:32:22,666
Don't.

362
00:32:22,738 --> 00:32:24,729
Did I miss something?

363
00:32:24,807 --> 00:32:26,741
Get in the car, Wes.

364
00:32:29,345 --> 00:32:32,041
- Tried to sing you songs?
- Ugh...

365
00:32:32,114 --> 00:32:35,572
Well, no wonder you want
the pleasure of my company.

366
00:32:41,156 --> 00:32:43,147
[Engine Revs]

367
00:32:47,329 --> 00:32:49,559
[Tires Screeching]

368
00:32:51,467 --> 00:32:53,435
[Ford] Okay, they're
on the move again.

369
00:32:53,502 --> 00:32:56,164
First sign of trouble,
I'm bringing them in.

370
00:32:56,238 --> 00:33:01,107
- There's over $3 million in
automatic weapons on that truck.
- I know that.

371
00:33:01,176 --> 00:33:04,441
Then you know the array of tragedy
those guns are going to inflict when...

372
00:33:04,513 --> 00:33:07,710
- they hit the streets of Jersey?
- I want the man
who puts them on the streets.

373
00:33:07,783 --> 00:33:10,650
We don't take him out,
he'll have $3 million in automatic...

374
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:13,381
weapons comin' up from Georgia
this time next week.

375
00:33:13,455 --> 00:33:17,186
I mean, that might keep you in a job,
but it's not the solution.

376
00:33:17,259 --> 00:33:20,524
Guy driving is Jack Philip Crews.
Did two years in Bayside.

377
00:33:20,596 --> 00:33:23,895
That sounds like just the kind of man
you want hauling a load of artillery.

378
00:33:23,966 --> 00:33:27,197
No priors. He was released three weeks
ago, early parole for good behavior.

379
00:33:27,269 --> 00:33:30,102
- Looks like he's just the driver.
- What'd he do his time for?

380
00:33:30,172 --> 00:33:33,164
- Vehicular manslaughter.
- Thank you.

381
00:33:36,312 --> 00:33:39,839
[Ringing, Beeps]

382
00:33:39,915 --> 00:33:41,849
- Crews residence.
- Hey, little one.

383
00:33:41,917 --> 00:33:43,851
- Dad!
- So, how was school?

384
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,719
Great. We had a half a day.
Are you still gonna help me
with my free throws tonight?

385
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:50,418
Well, I, uh...
I can't tonight, honey.

386
00:33:50,492 --> 00:33:53,120
If I wanna buy you
those high-tops, I gotta work late.

387
00:33:53,195 --> 00:33:55,425
But, no way
I'm missin' your game.

388
00:33:55,497 --> 00:33:59,593
- So, can I speak to your mom?
- Yeah.

389
00:33:59,668 --> 00:34:02,660
- Mom.
- Go get your homework started, okay?

390
00:34:02,738 --> 00:34:04,672
Okay.

391
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:09,439
- Jack? Where are you?
- North Carolina.

392
00:34:09,511 --> 00:34:12,207
Look, I know you didn't
want me to do this but...

393
00:34:12,281 --> 00:34:16,274
Melanie, I can't
let us lose that house.

394
00:34:16,352 --> 00:34:19,879
I think we both know this is about
more than the house, Jack.

395
00:34:19,955 --> 00:34:22,287
It's about you.

396
00:34:22,358 --> 00:34:27,796
[Sighs] Well, I'll be home as soon
as I can. I love you.

397
00:34:29,765 --> 00:34:31,790
Be careful.

398
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:36,804
[Phone Beeps]

399
00:34:38,974 --> 00:34:40,965
[Beeps]

400
00:35:02,331 --> 00:35:06,461
- How long you been drivin' trucks?
- Since I was 18.

401
00:35:06,535 --> 00:35:09,834
- Not much for school, huh?
- Had to make a living.

402
00:35:11,873 --> 00:35:14,103
I was gonna be a football player
before I screwed up my knee.

403
00:35:14,176 --> 00:35:17,270
So, now you run guns
instead of footballs.

404
00:35:19,014 --> 00:35:21,414
I'm gonna make me
some serious money.

405
00:35:21,483 --> 00:35:25,249
Buy a house on the lake.
Hell, I might even buy me a lake.

406
00:35:26,822 --> 00:35:30,314
Find a nice little honey,
settle down.

407
00:35:30,392 --> 00:35:35,193
- How about you? You got big dreams?
- I'm workin' on it.

408
00:35:35,263 --> 00:35:37,231
[Crews]
Oh, shi...

409
00:35:37,299 --> 00:35:40,097
What's wrong?

410
00:35:40,168 --> 00:35:43,137
There's a weigh station
on both of these roads.

411
00:35:43,205 --> 00:35:47,005
- One of 'em is bound to be open.
- So, we got a 50-50 chance.

412
00:35:47,075 --> 00:35:51,341
- That's right.
- Earl said take 85.

413
00:36:01,723 --> 00:36:05,887
Where the hell is he goin'?
I told him not to take 26.

414
00:36:12,167 --> 00:36:14,328
[Sighs]

415
00:36:23,612 --> 00:36:27,605
[Man] Okay, let's see
your next set of axles.

416
00:36:27,683 --> 00:36:32,279
Hold it there.

417
00:36:32,354 --> 00:36:34,288
Pull forward, driver.

418
00:36:34,356 --> 00:36:36,187
Next two.

419
00:36:43,265 --> 00:36:45,199
- [Engine Idling]
- Gonna go grab a smoke.

420
00:36:56,278 --> 00:36:59,679
Pull forward, driver.

421
00:37:12,728 --> 00:37:14,662
- How are you, sir?
- All right. How are you?

422
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:18,791
- Okay.
- You know you got
a headlight out up there?

423
00:37:18,867 --> 00:37:21,358
- What'd ya do to your front end?
- She was that way when I picked her up.

424
00:37:21,436 --> 00:37:24,462
It's not my usual rig.

425
00:37:24,539 --> 00:37:26,837
Pull up, driver.
Next two.

426
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,610
Hold it there.

[Air Brakes Hissing]

00:37:41,556 --> 00:37:44,582
Hey, uh... Bobby Lewis
still work here?

429
00:37:44,659 --> 00:37:47,492
- Big guy. Wrestler.
- You talkin' about Pooh Bear.

430
00:37:47,562 --> 00:37:51,328
- Pooh Bear... Yeah.
- No. He took a private job...

431
00:37:51,399 --> 00:37:54,129
down in Orlando
about a year ago now.

432
00:37:54,202 --> 00:37:56,636
So, you haven't made
this run in a while, have you?

433
00:37:56,705 --> 00:37:58,764
No, sir, not in
a couple of years.

434
00:38:00,475 --> 00:38:02,670
Pull forward, driver.

[Air Brakes Hiss]

437
00:38:15,457 --> 00:38:18,756
- You're right at the limit.
- Aw, you know these guys.

438
00:38:18,827 --> 00:38:21,193
They try to ring
every dollar from a load.

439
00:38:21,263 --> 00:38:25,393
- You pull for this outfit often?
- Not when I can help it.

440
00:38:25,467 --> 00:38:28,300
Got a load of bathroom
fixtures, huh?

00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:31,203
Yeah. Toilets.
[Chuckles]

442
00:38:33,975 --> 00:38:36,102
I tell you what. Why don't
you pull up right over there?

443
00:38:36,178 --> 00:38:38,237
And I'm just gonna take
a quick look in the back.

00:38:38,313 --> 00:38:40,713
All right. Will do.

Yeah. Yeah.
I'll get back with you later.

She's in a cancer ward
at Good Samaritan in Philly.

450
00:39:13,915 --> 00:39:17,612
You wanna give 'em a call?
Ask for Nadine Boxer.

451
00:39:17,686 --> 00:39:22,453
Don't keep her on the phone too long.
She doesn't have a lot of strength left.

00:39:24,392 --> 00:39:28,158

- They wanted to take a look.

a first for a truckload of shitters.

- No. He came with the load.

- [Snarls, Pants]
- Jim!

- Hey, Jim!
- Yeah!

- I need to talk to you for a minute.
- [Tiny Growls]

462
00:40:48,043 --> 00:40:50,068

on that dog.

- Something is...
- What?

466
00:41:06,227 --> 00:41:09,128
I get the feeling somebody wanted us
to get through here.

467
00:41:13,268 --> 00:41:17,534
That was too close. You played
this thing with no margin for error.

468
00:41:17,605 --> 00:41:20,733
You should always leave a margin.
You've got to have margins.

469
00:41:20,809 --> 00:41:22,743
Do me a favor,
huh, therapy boy?

out later... in group.

This is a control issue
for you, isn't it, Allen?

472
00:41:27,582 --> 00:41:30,380
This is a surveillance
operation, McClaren.

473
00:41:30,452 --> 00:41:33,819
- There are layers.
- Oh... Layers.

474
00:41:33,888 --> 00:41:37,346
- What else do we know
about the driver?
- He works the Jersey docks.

475
00:41:37,425 --> 00:41:40,258
He's got a wife
and kid in Milburn.

476

That phone call you made
before, that was your wife?

- Didn't tell her you
was comin', did you?
- Let's just say, uh,

478
00:42:03,718 --> 00:42:05,777
she doesn't like it
when I drive.

479
00:42:08,223 --> 00:42:11,681

be nice to be missed.

No, you're not gonna do that, because
you want your little guns too bad.

So I'm gonna tell you where
to bring Melanie and Tracy,

my family for your guns.

- I know it'll mean a lot to his family.
- He was a good man.

I was in contact with him
on the truck,

881
01:17:58,968 --> 01:18:02,961
and we would have done all right
by you, even if we hadn't had
our little discussion.

- What discussion?
- Your husband told us
where to find Cutler,

I think you'll do fine on this.
