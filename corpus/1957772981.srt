00:01:54,462 --> 00:01:58,074
When I was 14, my sister found
20 bags of crack

1
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:01,077
and a gun in my closet.

2
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,166
She threw them in the river

3
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,430
'cause she didn't know if I had
shot somebody or not.

4
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:11,827
She warned me not to keep
going down that road.

5
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:15,004
I didn't listen to her.

6
00:02:15,047 --> 00:02:17,963
I got arrested and I went up
north for five years.

7
00:02:22,881 --> 00:02:24,753
She came to see me,

8
00:02:24,796 --> 00:02:27,843
tried to make it look like
everything was alright.

9
00:02:27,886 --> 00:02:30,802
But I could tell she started
using again.

10
00:02:37,766 --> 00:02:39,637
I looked at my whole life

11
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:42,988
and what I've done.

12
00:02:43,032 --> 00:02:45,513
People just trying to get by

13
00:02:45,556 --> 00:02:47,950
and how I used to prey on them.

14
00:02:47,993 --> 00:02:51,214
And now they preyed
on my sister.

15
00:02:51,258 --> 00:02:54,217
When those gates opened
and I got out,

16
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:57,394
I wasn't the same person
that I was when I went in.

17
00:03:02,573 --> 00:03:05,489
'Cause now I have something
I never had before.

18
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,016
I have a reason.

19
00:03:13,454 --> 00:03:14,890
Whoa, what's up, bro?

20
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:16,239
Where you coming from?

21
00:03:16,283 --> 00:03:18,154
A friend's house.

22
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,088
What are you doing in the back
of this alley by yourself, man?

23
00:03:20,112 --> 00:03:21,438
You know how dangerous
it is back here?

24
00:03:21,462 --> 00:03:23,072
Going home.

25
00:03:23,115 --> 00:03:24,615
Where the hell is your
parents at, man?

26
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,988
I don't know.

27
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:27,183
Look, you remind me when
I was little, man.

28
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,487
You can't be walking
around here.

29
00:03:28,512 --> 00:03:30,253
People gonna take
advantage of you.

30
00:03:30,297 --> 00:03:31,535
You're gonna have drug dealers
promising you things,

31
00:03:31,559 --> 00:03:33,300
you're gonna be
doing dumb things,

32
00:03:33,343 --> 00:03:35,278
you're gonna be robbing people,
disrespecting old people.

33
00:03:35,302 --> 00:03:37,173
I'm fed up seeing kids
walking the streets

34
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,914
doing this and nobody cares.

35
00:03:38,957 --> 00:03:40,544
I'm tired of doing dirt,
I don't want to do dirt no more

36
00:03:40,568 --> 00:03:41,980
and I don't want to see
you out here no more,

37
00:03:42,004 --> 00:03:43,788
you understand me?
Yes.

38
00:03:43,832 --> 00:03:45,399
Now, I'm gonna give you
some money

39
00:03:45,442 --> 00:03:47,270
'cause I know you probably
didn't eat.

40
00:03:47,314 --> 00:03:49,161
And you can tell you parents
or don't tell them,

41
00:03:49,185 --> 00:03:51,231
but here, here you go.

42
00:03:52,797 --> 00:03:54,408
Make sure you spend it
on some food, man.

43
00:03:54,451 --> 00:03:56,497
Don't give it to nobody else,
you understand me?

44
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,412
And I better not see your ass
back here again.

45
00:03:58,455 --> 00:04:01,066
Now, get out of here.

46
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,479
And put some pep in your
fucking step,

47
00:04:02,503 --> 00:04:04,635
get to steppin'.

48
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:07,682
Find some friends
to play with, boy.

49
00:04:07,725 --> 00:04:09,379
My brother ain't shittin', man.

50
00:04:09,423 --> 00:04:12,643
We done like... like five armed
robberies and shit, right?

51
00:04:12,687 --> 00:04:14,428
On the last one,
when we was coming out,

52
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:16,081
a customer was coming in.

53
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,755
I tell my brother,
"Yo, we gotta snatch this cat"

54
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:19,694
"'cause he's a witness."

55
00:04:19,737 --> 00:04:21,628
You know what I'm saying? "Let's
put this dude in the trunk",

56
00:04:21,652 --> 00:04:23,480
"you know what I'm saying?
If not,"

57
00:04:23,524 --> 00:04:25,924
"you know what I'm saying, 9 out
of 10 we gonna get knocked."

58
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:28,137
But my brother said,
"Nah, man, fuck it. We good."

59
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,660
So, I said,
"Alright let's go."

60
00:04:29,704 --> 00:04:32,097
We jumps in the whip,
we riding through Nine.

61
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:34,143
All of a sudden,
I look in the mirror,

62
00:04:34,186 --> 00:04:37,494
I see the police but he don't
put his lights on.Word.

63
00:04:37,538 --> 00:04:39,322
So, my brother like,
"Yo, it's the police!"

64
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:41,803
I said, "Yeah, chill, chill,
relax, relax."

65
00:04:41,846 --> 00:04:45,285
Alright? So, as we sitting there
at a red light,

66
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:48,636
all of a sudden the light
come on, "Whoo-whoo-whoo!"

67
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:50,396
So, my brother's like, "Yo, what
you want me to do?"

68
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,006
I said, "Pull out, nigger!"
He said, "Go through the light?"

69
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,119
I said, "Yeah!"

70
00:04:54,163 --> 00:04:56,383
So, my brother just pulls out
behind the other cars

71
00:04:56,426 --> 00:04:57,645
and just shoots across on 9-W.

72
00:04:57,688 --> 00:04:59,864
That's what I'm talking about.

73
00:04:59,908 --> 00:05:01,842
Right? So, we flyin'.
Next thing I know, I look...

74
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:04,782
We got, like, 15 police cars
behind us. Shit was crazy.

75
00:05:04,826 --> 00:05:07,045
So my brother's like,
"Yo, son, I don't wanna die."

76
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:08,917
I'm telling him to go
through the road block.

77
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,745
You know what I'm saying?
He's like...

78
00:05:10,788 --> 00:05:12,723
"Yo, you lived your life,
I ain't trying to go to jail,"

79
00:05:12,747 --> 00:05:14,488
yada-yada-yada.
He said,

80
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:17,142
"Yo, man!" I thought about it,
I was like, "You know what?"

81
00:05:17,186 --> 00:05:18,709
That's the only reason
I surrendered.

82
00:05:18,753 --> 00:05:20,470
'Cause I was gonna go
through the roadblock.

83
00:05:20,494 --> 00:05:21,930
Ah, man.

84
00:05:21,973 --> 00:05:24,062
So, we threw the gats
out of the car and all that,

85
00:05:24,106 --> 00:05:26,848
we surrender. I end up getting,
like, 12 years for that.

86
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:28,782
That's what I'm saying, man.
The game ain't no joke.

87
00:05:28,806 --> 00:05:30,218
That's why this shit now
that we're doing with Ulysses,

88
00:05:30,242 --> 00:05:31,437
I ain't got time to play games,

89
00:05:31,461 --> 00:05:33,550
know what I'm saying?

90
00:05:33,594 --> 00:05:35,093
'Cause I'm batty-batty with them
guns, you know what I'm saying?

91
00:05:35,117 --> 00:05:36,118
Yeah, man.

92
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:37,467
Life is real.

93
00:06:10,457 --> 00:06:11,762
I'm Keisha.

94
00:06:11,806 --> 00:06:13,024
Hey.

95
00:06:13,068 --> 00:06:16,419
Thanks for seeing me.

96
00:06:16,463 --> 00:06:18,378
No problem.

97
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,863
I heard about what happened
to your sister.

98
00:06:25,907 --> 00:06:27,648
I'm sorry about that.

99
00:06:27,691 --> 00:06:30,607
Uh, Tammy said maybe
you could help me.

100
00:06:32,783 --> 00:06:34,568
What's going on?

101
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:38,093
Do you know Derek Young?

102
00:06:38,136 --> 00:06:39,616
No.

103
00:06:41,705 --> 00:06:44,012
Oh.

104
00:06:44,055 --> 00:06:47,972
Well, I started seeing him
about six months ago.

105
00:06:55,153 --> 00:06:56,894
You know want to
tell me about it?

106
00:08:18,846 --> 00:08:21,196
Yo.

107
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:22,545
You seen Derek Young?

108
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:23,677
No.

109
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,069
No, I haven't seen him.

110
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:42,217
What's up?

111
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,175
You seen Derek Young?

112
00:09:36,271 --> 00:09:39,753
Yo. You Derek Young?

113
00:09:39,796 --> 00:09:41,711
That's me.

114
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:50,894
Is there a problem?

115
00:11:21,332 --> 00:11:23,030
Yo, man, that cookout
last night?

116
00:11:23,073 --> 00:11:26,033
Yo, that shit was off
the fucking chain, man.

117
00:11:26,076 --> 00:11:28,470
Seen that bitch with the fat ass
with the dookie shoot ass?

118
00:11:28,513 --> 00:11:30,341
White pants?

119
00:11:30,385 --> 00:11:31,884
Yeah, yo, that's the one I was
telling you about, nigger.

120
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:33,364
You put your dick up in
that ass too fucking fast

121
00:11:33,388 --> 00:11:34,781
you gonna shoot
all over the place,

122
00:11:34,824 --> 00:11:36,478
that's what I call
the dookie shoot.

123
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:37,977
Yo, did you see them
punk motherfuckers

124
00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:39,587
over there trying to act
like they was tough?

125
00:11:39,611 --> 00:11:41,613
We need to get them
motherfuckers, though, man,

126
00:11:41,657 --> 00:11:43,877
I'm telling you. Stick 'em up,
lay 'em down. It's on.

127
00:12:00,981 --> 00:12:02,417
Be easy, dawg.

128
00:12:06,073 --> 00:12:07,814
What the fuck is these
motherfuckers doing?

129
00:12:08,858 --> 00:12:10,773
Yo!

130
00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:15,952
I should have known it was
your motherfucking ass.

131
00:12:15,996 --> 00:12:17,669
What you got, some crack head
bitch up in there?

132
00:12:17,693 --> 00:12:19,613
Some little whore? Your dick
gonna fall off, man.

133
00:12:19,651 --> 00:12:21,455
You better calm down with them
nasty ass bitches,

134
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:22,872
that's what I'm gonna tell you.

135
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,284
Who the fuck you got
back here anyway, man?

136
00:12:24,308 --> 00:12:25,440
I'm tired of this bullshit.

137
00:12:25,483 --> 00:12:27,050
What's good?
How you doing?

138
00:12:27,094 --> 00:12:28,530
How you doing, brother?

139
00:12:28,573 --> 00:12:30,532
Yo, some real serious shit
we got to talk about

140
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:31,838
and it has to be handled with.

141
00:12:31,881 --> 00:12:33,535
Talk about? It's a tight situation.

142
00:12:33,578 --> 00:12:35,319
Help me out with this story.

143
00:12:35,363 --> 00:12:37,452
Maybe we can end it together.

144
00:12:37,495 --> 00:12:38,734
Those are blue bags right there.

145
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,717
Alright, so, check 'em out.

146
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,806
This shit is soap.
Those are beads, man.

147
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,460
I ain't gonna be
the only motherfucker

148
00:12:45,503 --> 00:12:47,244
standing on the street

149
00:12:47,288 --> 00:12:49,527
that gonna have to pay for this
bullshit that's going on.

150
00:12:49,551 --> 00:12:50,770
No, this shit's a problem.

151
00:12:50,813 --> 00:12:51,814
Hold on.

152
00:12:51,858 --> 00:12:53,773
This is the mystery.

153
00:12:56,645 --> 00:12:57,970
Who the fuck is selling
the clear bags?

154
00:12:57,994 --> 00:12:59,604
That's Rex's shit.Motherfucker.

155
00:12:59,648 --> 00:13:01,084
Where you find these at?

156
00:13:01,128 --> 00:13:03,391
Same place.
Wow.

157
00:13:03,434 --> 00:13:05,436
And when I find these behind the
motherfucking, uh,

158
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,916
art centre in the alley,

159
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,700
motherfucking crack head
Christine,

160
00:13:08,744 --> 00:13:10,417
I see her, I'm like,
"Hey, girl, what's up?

161
00:13:10,441 --> 00:13:11,723
"I ain't seen you." You know
what that bitch told me?

162
00:13:11,747 --> 00:13:13,053
What did she say?

163
00:13:13,096 --> 00:13:14,421
I ain't fucking with you
motherfuckers,

164
00:13:14,445 --> 00:13:15,882
y'all are selling soup.Wow.

165
00:13:15,925 --> 00:13:17,448
And I'm not
gonna be standing out there

166
00:13:17,492 --> 00:13:18,885
by my motherfucking self

167
00:13:18,928 --> 00:13:20,756
while y'all sit here and
collect the money.

168
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,647
I respect y'all gangster,
y'all game and everything,

169
00:13:22,671 --> 00:13:24,475
but y'all gotta understand where
the fuck I'm coming from.

170
00:13:24,499 --> 00:13:25,998
I think that's Rex's shit
right there, man.

171
00:13:26,022 --> 00:13:27,894
Rex's name's all over that.

172
00:13:27,937 --> 00:13:30,810
Yo, this shit is getting
out of hand, man.

173
00:13:36,206 --> 00:13:38,252
- There's this dude, right?
- He says, "Honey,"

174
00:13:38,295 --> 00:13:40,167
"I'm in that mood,
I wanna go down."

175
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,535
She say, "Honey, it's that
time of the month."

176
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:43,300
He like, "I don't care."

177
00:13:43,344 --> 00:13:44,582
She said, "Well, if you don't
care, I don't care."

178
00:13:44,606 --> 00:13:46,042
So, then he starts
6-9ing, right?

179
00:13:46,086 --> 00:13:47,957
Like rabbits.
Doorbell rings.

180
00:13:48,001 --> 00:13:51,221
Mailman. She said, "Honey,
go get the door."

181
00:13:51,265 --> 00:13:52,614
He said, "Look at my mouth!"

182
00:13:52,657 --> 00:13:53,939
She said, "Baby,
it ain't nothing."

183
00:13:53,963 --> 00:13:55,443
"Just tell 'em I was
a jam sandwich."

184
00:13:55,486 --> 00:13:56,899
So, he go to the door,
it's the mailman.

185
00:13:56,923 --> 00:13:58,881
He said, "Look, sorry about
my mouth."

186
00:13:58,925 --> 00:14:00,840
"I was eating a jam
sandwich." He said,

187
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:02,948
"Man, I ain't worried about the
jam sandwich on your mouth."

188
00:14:02,972 --> 00:14:07,542
"I worry about the
peanut butter on your forehead."

189
00:14:07,585 --> 00:14:09,500
You get it?

190
00:14:09,544 --> 00:14:11,241
Peanut butter.

191
00:14:11,285 --> 00:14:12,764
6-9?

192
00:14:12,808 --> 00:14:14,201
Excuse me.

193
00:14:14,244 --> 00:14:16,029
It's my idea that you
go back to work.

194
00:14:16,072 --> 00:14:18,031
What do you think about it?

195
00:14:48,148 --> 00:14:50,628
Hey, what's up? What we got
going on over here?

196
00:14:50,672 --> 00:14:52,021
Car won't turn over.

197
00:14:52,065 --> 00:14:53,414
He said he got it
fixed yesterday,

198
00:14:53,457 --> 00:14:54,806
I don't know what happened.

199
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,219
Alright, well, why don't you
pop the hood

200
00:14:56,243 --> 00:14:57,683
and let me take a look
up under here.

201
00:14:57,722 --> 00:14:59,899
Glad to. I ain't doing
this no more.

202
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,295
Okay.

203
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,602
Alright, look, get in there
and turn it on now.

204
00:15:07,645 --> 00:15:09,560
Okay.

205
00:15:15,218 --> 00:15:19,266
It won't even start.

206
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:21,790
He said he got the car
fixed yesterday.

207
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,097
It won't start.

208
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,055
Okay, um, hold on.

209
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,366
It started!

210
00:15:32,409 --> 00:15:34,411
Yeah, there we go.

211
00:15:34,455 --> 00:15:36,457
It's the cable. Your cable
is rusted out.

212
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,940
Look, what I need you to do
right now

213
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,590
is go down to the garage

214
00:15:39,634 --> 00:15:42,680
and tell them you need
a new connector

215
00:15:42,724 --> 00:15:44,117
because the battery
is rusted out.

216
00:16:00,176 --> 00:16:03,092
What's up?
Hey, what's your name?

217
00:16:06,095 --> 00:16:07,053
What you got there?

218
00:16:07,096 --> 00:16:08,315
It's mine.

219
00:16:08,358 --> 00:16:10,012
Yeah, let me see that.
Come here.

220
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:12,362
Get off!

221
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:13,407
Get over here.

222
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,538
Get off me!

223
00:16:14,582 --> 00:16:15,670
I ain't gonna take it,

224
00:16:15,713 --> 00:16:16,734
I just wanna see what it is.

225
00:16:16,758 --> 00:16:18,673
What's your name?

226
00:16:18,716 --> 00:16:20,240
Lawrence.

227
00:16:20,283 --> 00:16:24,200
Lawrence, let me see
what you got there.

228
00:16:24,244 --> 00:16:27,160
If I gotta take it from you,
I'm not gonna give it back.

229
00:16:29,597 --> 00:16:31,512
Come on, now.

230
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:42,044
What's this?

231
00:16:42,088 --> 00:16:43,698
That's not mine.

232
00:16:43,741 --> 00:16:45,352
Whose is it, then?

233
00:16:45,395 --> 00:16:48,050
That's for Rex, I'm gonna
throw it over his fence.

234
00:16:48,094 --> 00:16:51,793
Why you gonna do that?

235
00:16:51,836 --> 00:16:54,752
'Cause he's gonna get me
a football.

236
00:17:03,196 --> 00:17:04,806
Here, you take this.

237
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:16,660
Get the fuck out of
my fucking face!

238
00:18:16,704 --> 00:18:18,619
You gonna get me what?

239
00:18:18,662 --> 00:18:21,970
I want all my money now!

240
00:18:22,013 --> 00:18:24,451
You need it? I don't know who
the fuck is gonna get it.

241
00:18:29,586 --> 00:18:31,806
Shut the fuck up, bitch,
like I fucking told you

242
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:33,242
unless you got my fucking money.

243
00:18:33,286 --> 00:18:34,896
Get the fuck up on out of here.

244
00:18:34,939 --> 00:18:37,099
Get the fuck up on out of here
and get out of here now.

245
00:19:01,575 --> 00:19:03,316
You have free samples today?

246
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:05,013
Not you, motherfucker.

247
00:19:05,056 --> 00:19:06,971
See you back from
South Carolina, huh?

248
00:19:07,015 --> 00:19:09,148
Got back Sunday.
What's it to you, bro?

249
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:10,888
You know you in
a school zone, right?

250
00:19:10,932 --> 00:19:13,978
210 yards away, still ain't got
nothing to do with you.

251
00:19:14,022 --> 00:19:16,198
What's all this information for?

252
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:17,982
I'm talking to you,
motherfucker.

253
00:19:18,026 --> 00:19:19,506
What the fuck is the problem?

254
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:21,092
You gonna sit there and look
fucking stupid now?

255
00:19:21,116 --> 00:19:22,335
Answer me, do something

256
00:19:22,378 --> 00:19:23,988
or get the fuck off my
fucking corner.

257
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:25,357
I don't need none
of this shit here.

258
00:19:25,381 --> 00:19:27,098
All I need is fucking
money and crack heads.

259
00:19:27,122 --> 00:19:29,100
I don't need no fucking body
coming here chastising me.

260
00:19:29,124 --> 00:19:31,387
Alright? So, see you
later, man.

261
00:19:31,431 --> 00:19:33,215
Can't get with you
right now, brother.

262
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:34,695
Well, you see,
I figure like this.

263
00:19:34,738 --> 00:19:37,132
Got these kids out here
pushing your shit,

264
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,961
these females strung out
on that shit,

265
00:19:40,004 --> 00:19:42,398
man, you best take your shit
on back to South Carolina.

266
00:19:42,442 --> 00:19:44,202
First of all, motherfucker,
ain't nobody making me

267
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:45,923
motherfucking go
no fucking where.

268
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:47,249
Do you understand what
I'm telling you?

269
00:19:47,273 --> 00:19:49,057
I'm here to motherfucking stay,

270
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,469
I'm gonna get all the cheddar
that's out this motherfucker.

271
00:19:50,493 --> 00:19:51,842
Do you understand?

272
00:19:51,886 --> 00:19:53,342
That's how it is?
You gonna do what you do

273
00:19:53,366 --> 00:19:54,691
and things just happen
the way they happen?

274
00:19:54,715 --> 00:19:56,238
You wasting my
motherfucking time.

275
00:19:56,282 --> 00:19:57,911
Get the fuck off my
motherfucking block, alright?

276
00:19:57,935 --> 00:19:59,739
Before some shit start popping
off outside this motherfucker

277
00:19:59,763 --> 00:20:01,678
and some shit you ain't gonna
be able to handle.

278
00:20:28,923 --> 00:20:30,838
Come on, baby, let's get moving.

279
00:20:34,972 --> 00:20:36,278
Lawrence, come on.

280
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:38,411
I'm gonna be late for work,
come on.

281
00:20:38,454 --> 00:20:40,456
Lawrence.

282
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,719
Let's go.

283
00:20:42,763 --> 00:20:44,678
Come on.

284
00:20:48,203 --> 00:20:50,118
Have a good day.
I love you.

285
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:50,221
We were going to move to this
place and it was above a bar

286
00:21:50,265 --> 00:21:52,354
and I didn't want Lawrence
to be around that.

287
00:21:52,398 --> 00:21:54,027
And how much were they trying
to take you for that one?

288
00:21:54,051 --> 00:21:56,140
1450. It's...

289
00:21:56,184 --> 00:21:57,838
And it was a one bedroom,
so I mean...

290
00:21:57,881 --> 00:21:59,622
I can't believe it.

291
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:01,992
It had a side room that could
have been used as a small office

292
00:22:02,016 --> 00:22:04,279
or Lawrence's room, but...

293
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,363
That sucks if it's up on top of
something like that.

294
00:22:07,674 --> 00:22:08,849
Oh, hold on.

295
00:22:08,892 --> 00:22:10,894
How are you?

296
00:22:10,938 --> 00:22:12,156
Good morning, guys.

297
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,157
How's everything?

298
00:22:13,201 --> 00:22:14,550
It's alright.

299
00:22:14,594 --> 00:22:15,638
Pleasure to see you.

300
00:22:15,682 --> 00:22:17,205
How are you guys doing today?

301
00:22:17,248 --> 00:22:18,815
Oh, okay.

302
00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:21,035
My momma used to say,
"Fair to middling"

303
00:22:21,078 --> 00:22:22,384
whatever that means.

304
00:22:22,428 --> 00:22:24,386
Good, what are we gonna
have this morning?

305
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,692
What you got?

306
00:22:25,735 --> 00:22:27,215
Menu hasn't changed.

307
00:22:27,258 --> 00:22:29,086
What, you can't figure
it out, Sherlock?

308
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,890
Oh, there she goes again.
She's always busting my balls.

309
00:22:30,914 --> 00:22:32,829
Man, all the time.
Every time we come here.

310
00:22:32,873 --> 00:22:34,720
That's what they call me,
"Ball Busting Keisha."

311
00:22:34,744 --> 00:22:36,592
You keep that up, I'm gonna
take you in the back room

312
00:22:36,616 --> 00:22:38,531
and I'm gonna work you over
at the station.

313
00:22:38,574 --> 00:22:40,663
Oh, what do you do,
do you tickle people?

314
00:22:40,707 --> 00:22:42,511
You take out your little night
stick, is that what you do?

315
00:22:42,535 --> 00:22:44,711
We bend... we bend people over.

316
00:22:44,754 --> 00:22:46,365
Yeah, okay. Spank them.

317
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:48,671
Smack 'em on their ass

318
00:22:48,715 --> 00:22:51,544
and pull all that long,
pretty hair you got.

319
00:22:51,587 --> 00:22:53,328
That's what we do
in the back room.

320
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,634
I want to ask you a question.

321
00:22:54,677 --> 00:22:56,549
You hear what happened
to your ex-boyfriend?

322
00:22:56,592 --> 00:22:59,508
Derek?

323
00:22:59,552 --> 00:23:01,554
No.

324
00:23:01,597 --> 00:23:03,207
Got the shit kicked out of him.

325
00:23:03,251 --> 00:23:05,427
Got beat fucking real bad, too.

326
00:23:05,471 --> 00:23:06,733
Stomped out.

327
00:23:06,776 --> 00:23:09,170
You filed a complaint
against him.

328
00:23:09,213 --> 00:23:10,693
Oh, you think I did it?

329
00:23:10,737 --> 00:23:12,303
Is it that time of the month?

330
00:23:12,347 --> 00:23:15,132
Look, I don't know what
happened to Derek, okay?

331
00:23:15,176 --> 00:23:16,917
How long have you been
through with him?

332
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,285
None of your business how long
I've been through with him.

333
00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:19,441
Oh, it could be my business.

334
00:23:19,485 --> 00:23:20,549
Hello? This is
Detective Boldt.

335
00:23:20,573 --> 00:23:21,835
And we will talk at the station

336
00:23:21,878 --> 00:23:22,986
if you don't make it my
business.

337
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,620
Yeah.

338
00:23:24,664 --> 00:23:26,274
Okay, where?

339
00:23:26,317 --> 00:23:28,363
Okay. We're on it.

340
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,061
Wow. We have a situation.

341
00:23:31,105 --> 00:23:33,020
We gotta get the hell
out of here.

342
00:23:58,219 --> 00:23:59,786
'Sup, fellas?
How you doing?

343
00:23:59,829 --> 00:24:01,222
How's everything, alright?

344
00:24:01,265 --> 00:24:02,615
How's everything, Carver?

345
00:24:02,658 --> 00:24:04,138
So, you can see we got
a dead body,

346
00:24:04,181 --> 00:24:06,140
so, doesn't look natural at all.

347
00:24:06,183 --> 00:24:08,055
Basically, got a 911 call.

348
00:24:08,098 --> 00:24:10,207
She's walking through the woods
in this direction right here

349
00:24:10,231 --> 00:24:12,363
and she stumbled across
the body.

350
00:24:12,407 --> 00:24:15,323
Looks like a homicide, you know,
just from plain sight.

351
00:24:15,366 --> 00:24:17,151
I checked him...
No ID, no wallet.

352
00:24:17,194 --> 00:24:20,197
And, um, no phone. Called the
ME, like, 10 minutes ago,

353
00:24:20,241 --> 00:24:22,480
should be, like, 45 minutes.
They're backed up right now.

354
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:24,224
Ma'am, just get behind
the crime scene tape.

355
00:24:30,077 --> 00:24:31,034
Where my strap at?

356
00:24:31,078 --> 00:24:32,296
It's in the car, son.

357
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,907
Fool's gonna get the
homie filthy,

358
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,561
cut his neck open
from ear to ear.

359
00:24:35,604 --> 00:24:37,214
We gotta take care of this ASAP.

360
00:24:37,258 --> 00:24:39,260
Listen, killers, slow down.

361
00:24:39,303 --> 00:24:41,281
Hold up, son, we need to
take care of this business.

362
00:24:41,305 --> 00:24:42,698
Listen...

363
00:24:42,742 --> 00:24:44,657
Yo, I went back with him
since eight years old.

364
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,789
Yo, put the strap away,
put the strap away.

365
00:24:46,833 --> 00:24:48,008
What we gonna do about this?

366
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:49,705
Put the strap away.

367
00:24:49,749 --> 00:24:52,055
'Cause we gotta do this shit
the right way, dawg.

368
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:54,667
God damn, man.

369
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,016
So, how we gonna handle this?

370
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:57,496
Yo, Rex got to die, man.

371
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:58,714
Straight jacket.

372
00:24:58,758 --> 00:25:00,368
We can't fucking run out there

373
00:25:00,411 --> 00:25:01,891
like wild cowboys.

374
00:25:01,935 --> 00:25:03,589
This is fucking business, man.

375
00:25:03,632 --> 00:25:06,026
We need a fall guy, man.

376
00:25:06,069 --> 00:25:07,549
That's what we need.

377
00:25:07,593 --> 00:25:10,247
Somebody that's gonna
do this shit

378
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:12,119
to keep our names out of it.

379
00:25:12,162 --> 00:25:13,575
It's on you to decide
how we do this,

380
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:15,209
but my man, something
gotta be done.

381
00:25:15,252 --> 00:25:17,013
I'm ready to get stoked,
you know what I'm saying?

382
00:25:17,037 --> 00:25:19,779
I got the perfect motherfucker
for this one.

383
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:32,618
Are you Earl Coleman?

384
00:25:32,661 --> 00:25:34,228
Yeah, I am.
What's up?

385
00:25:34,271 --> 00:25:37,057
Well, do you know
the Columbia Apartments?

386
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,712
Rough away over there?
Yeah.

387
00:25:39,755 --> 00:25:42,758
Well, some of us are on
hard times, you know.

388
00:25:42,802 --> 00:25:45,587
Not me so much because
I'm retired.

389
00:25:45,631 --> 00:25:47,850
But some are on assistance.

390
00:25:47,894 --> 00:25:50,592
And I don't think what they're
doing to them is right.

391
00:25:50,636 --> 00:25:52,594
They're getting greedier
and greedier

392
00:25:52,638 --> 00:25:54,596
and they're taking advantage

393
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,729
and they're ruining it
for everybody.

394
00:25:56,772 --> 00:25:58,861
It ain't right.

395
00:25:58,905 --> 00:26:00,559
Okay, so what's been
going on over there?

396
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:03,300
You know Mylo and them?

397
00:26:03,344 --> 00:26:07,435
I know Mylo. What's he
been up to?

398
00:26:18,054 --> 00:26:19,360
How you doing?

399
00:26:19,403 --> 00:26:20,840
What's up?
Yo, is Mylo here?

400
00:26:20,883 --> 00:26:22,058
No, he's not.

401
00:26:22,102 --> 00:26:23,973
You know where he's at?

402
00:26:24,017 --> 00:26:26,017
No, I haven't seen him,
I don't know where he's at.

403
00:27:16,983 --> 00:27:19,246
Hey, Earl.

404
00:27:19,289 --> 00:27:21,204
Hey.

405
00:27:21,248 --> 00:27:24,033
How you doing?
This your son?

406
00:27:24,077 --> 00:27:25,556
This is my son.

407
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,689
Lawrence, say hi.Hi.

408
00:27:27,733 --> 00:27:29,691
Hey, Lawrence, nice to
meet you again.

409
00:27:29,735 --> 00:27:31,084
You two know each other?

410
00:27:31,127 --> 00:27:32,259
Just around.

411
00:27:32,302 --> 00:27:33,608
You get that football?

412
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:34,870
What football?

413
00:27:34,914 --> 00:27:36,655
No.

414
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:39,570
Nothing.

415
00:27:39,614 --> 00:27:41,877
So, what are you
doing around here?

416
00:27:41,921 --> 00:27:44,967
I'm just waiting for someone.

417
00:27:45,011 --> 00:27:46,926
Lawrence, go inside.

418
00:27:50,407 --> 00:27:53,410
I wanted to thank you
for what you did.

419
00:27:53,454 --> 00:27:54,977
You having any trouble?

420
00:27:55,021 --> 00:27:57,414
No, but I heard what happened.

421
00:27:57,458 --> 00:27:59,329
I thought you were just
going to talk to him.

422
00:27:59,373 --> 00:28:01,549
Well, he didn't feel
like talking.

423
00:28:01,592 --> 00:28:03,507
Sounds like Derek.

424
00:28:05,814 --> 00:28:07,120
Can I ask you something?

425
00:28:07,163 --> 00:28:08,861
Sure.

426
00:28:08,904 --> 00:28:11,777
Can I take you out to dinner?

427
00:28:16,129 --> 00:28:17,870
If you're busy, you know,
you don't want to,

428
00:28:17,913 --> 00:28:20,394
you can't make it,
I mean, you know,

429
00:28:20,437 --> 00:28:21,874
it's okay.

430
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:24,398
No, we could do that.

431
00:28:24,441 --> 00:28:26,356
How about tomorrow night?

432
00:28:28,489 --> 00:28:30,056
Okay.

433
00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:33,015
Um, but, promise me
I can pay for it.

434
00:28:39,805 --> 00:28:41,720
Here he comes now, man.

435
00:28:44,026 --> 00:28:45,636
Hey, homie, what's up, man?

436
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,247
Yo, what up, what's up?

437
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,379
Chillin', baby.
Yo, you know my man Z, right?

438
00:28:49,423 --> 00:28:50,729
Yeah, I know him.

439
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:52,513
What's up, what you
doing out there?

440
00:28:52,556 --> 00:28:54,186
Man, yo, I just want to holler
at you, baby, for a minute.

441
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:56,256
At me? Yeah, you got a minute?

442
00:28:56,299 --> 00:28:57,953
Relax, bro, relax.

443
00:28:57,997 --> 00:28:59,563
Alright, go ahead, holler, then.

444
00:28:59,607 --> 00:29:01,043
What?

445
00:29:01,087 --> 00:29:02,804
Not here, do you think
we could go in the crib?

446
00:29:02,828 --> 00:29:05,613
Just me and you.

447
00:29:05,656 --> 00:29:07,093
Yo, Z, hang back.

448
00:29:07,136 --> 00:29:09,704
I got you.

449
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,662
Yeah, alright.

450
00:29:16,972 --> 00:29:18,887
Come on.

451
00:29:27,548 --> 00:29:29,768
So, you still down at the
motherfucking garage and shit?

452
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:31,006
How they treating you
down there?

453
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,858
The garage is treating me good.

454
00:29:32,901 --> 00:29:35,053
Look, man, I ain't trying to
knock your hustle and all that,

455
00:29:35,077 --> 00:29:37,819
man gotta eat but, man...

456
00:29:37,863 --> 00:29:40,822
11 bucks an hour? That just
ain't making it, dawg.

457
00:29:40,866 --> 00:29:42,519
It's better than being up north

458
00:29:42,563 --> 00:29:43,956
making 50 cents a day.

459
00:29:43,999 --> 00:29:45,566
Dude, the boy just down there,

460
00:29:45,609 --> 00:29:48,308
holding doors at the donut shop,
he made more than that.

461
00:29:48,351 --> 00:29:49,570
Is that right?

462
00:29:49,613 --> 00:29:51,572
Listen. You know
Skull, right?

463
00:29:51,615 --> 00:29:53,835
Well, they found him, man.
Found him in the woods.

464
00:29:53,879 --> 00:29:55,271
Cut the fuck up, dawg.

465
00:29:55,315 --> 00:29:57,708
In that game, baby, that's
how it is.

466
00:29:57,752 --> 00:29:59,580
Bump all that, man.
Real problem,

467
00:29:59,623 --> 00:30:01,277
real reason I'm here...

468
00:30:01,321 --> 00:30:03,149
Yo, this kid Rex from
around the way,

469
00:30:03,192 --> 00:30:05,194
this dude is pushing
up on me, man.

470
00:30:05,238 --> 00:30:08,154
I'm hearing shit about,
yo, he got a crew

471
00:30:08,197 --> 00:30:10,678
that he trying to
bring through to the Valley.

472
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:12,506
Come on, man, this is
where we from

473
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:14,943
and you know I can't let it
go down like that.

474
00:30:14,987 --> 00:30:16,858
When I make moves,

475
00:30:16,902 --> 00:30:18,904
I'm gonna need a soldier
like you, man.

476
00:30:18,947 --> 00:30:22,255
So, check this.

477
00:30:22,298 --> 00:30:24,605
That's 10 stacks.

478
00:30:24,648 --> 00:30:27,216
Don't mean shit to me, dawg.

479
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,566
You sending me 10 stacks
for what?

480
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:31,220
Means you got a fucking problem?

481
00:30:31,264 --> 00:30:33,005
That's the problem right there.

482
00:30:33,048 --> 00:30:34,136
It's your word, huh?

483
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,572
Yeah, that's my word, man.

484
00:30:35,616 --> 00:30:37,183
That's my word. Come on, dawg.

485
00:30:37,226 --> 00:30:39,228
You can't be liking this shit
right here, man.

486
00:30:39,272 --> 00:30:41,274
Living in this small ass
apartment.

487
00:30:41,317 --> 00:30:42,797
Look at this shit, B.

488
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,712
You know what?
I go to bed at night

489
00:30:44,755 --> 00:30:46,409
knowing that what I'm doing,

490
00:30:46,453 --> 00:30:48,344
I'm doing it for the cause
and not for the because.

491
00:30:48,368 --> 00:30:50,085
Motherfucker, I'm not
asking you to do nothing

492
00:30:50,109 --> 00:30:51,762
against your nature, dawg.

493
00:30:51,806 --> 00:30:53,915
You used to be... you used to be
a O.G. in the hood, man.

494
00:30:53,939 --> 00:30:55,462
Like, you was somebody
I looked up to.

495
00:30:55,505 --> 00:30:57,377
You gotta be fucking
kidding me right now.

496
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,466
I try to get you back
in the game, get you right,

497
00:30:59,509 --> 00:31:00,641
you know what I'm saying?

498
00:31:00,684 --> 00:31:01,816
And this is how you act?

499
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,948
And one bid ain't enough?

500
00:31:02,991 --> 00:31:04,123
You do one fucking bid, son.

501
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:05,733
One bid and you turn soft!

502
00:31:05,776 --> 00:31:08,040
One bid is all it takes, man.

503
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:09,345
Wake up. You up in my house.

504
00:31:09,389 --> 00:31:11,043
Fuck that, man. You in my house.

505
00:31:11,086 --> 00:31:12,131
What's the problem, man?

506
00:31:12,174 --> 00:31:13,567
Tell me what the problem is.

507
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:15,830
You just ain't man enough
to do a real job.

508
00:31:23,272 --> 00:31:24,230
What's up?

509
00:31:24,273 --> 00:31:25,231
No bueno, son.

510
00:31:25,274 --> 00:31:26,406
He didn't go for it, huh?

511
00:31:26,449 --> 00:31:29,931
Nah, man.
Wow.

512
00:31:29,975 --> 00:31:31,672
So wat are we gonna do now?

513
00:31:31,715 --> 00:31:33,326
Shit, the show don't stop.

514
00:31:33,369 --> 00:31:35,719
Fuck him. We gotta do what
we gotta do.

515
00:31:35,763 --> 00:31:37,112
So, you gonna call that girl?

516
00:31:37,156 --> 00:31:40,028
Yeah, I think Ariel
need to get on this one.

517
00:31:40,072 --> 00:31:43,292
I can't believe this faggot, yo.

518
00:31:43,336 --> 00:31:45,642
Fuck it, man.

519
00:31:45,686 --> 00:31:46,948
That's what it is.

520
00:31:46,992 --> 00:31:48,907
Come on, man, let's
get out of here.

521
00:31:56,436 --> 00:31:58,742
When we gonna do something
together? I need some guap.

522
00:31:58,786 --> 00:32:00,962
We gotta take care of this
business with Ulysses first,

523
00:32:01,006 --> 00:32:02,461
you know what I'm saying,
but we can get up.

524
00:32:02,485 --> 00:32:05,227
Yeah, if he ever fucking
call us and shit.

525
00:32:05,271 --> 00:32:06,620
Man, it's hotter
than the bitch...

526
00:32:06,663 --> 00:32:08,423
Where you get this
old ass shit from, anyway?

527
00:32:09,492 --> 00:32:10,929
Yo, this shit is crazy, man.

528
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:13,322
Tell me you had this shit
before you went in.

529
00:32:13,366 --> 00:32:15,324
Mmm. Yeah, man, I still be on
my grind, man.

530
00:32:15,368 --> 00:32:17,346
Shit has changed over the years,
man, you know what I'm saying?

531
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:19,000
Nigger gotta be careful,
you know what I'm saying?

532
00:32:19,024 --> 00:32:20,677
I ain't trying to
go back to jail.

533
00:32:20,721 --> 00:32:23,593
You break my nigger off with
60/40 and that's it!

534
00:32:23,637 --> 00:32:25,856
My nigger just came home.

535
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,468
He's supposed to get
bread off Fred.

536
00:32:28,511 --> 00:32:30,098
Yeah, I'll be on the block,
don't worry about that.

537
00:32:30,122 --> 00:32:31,862
I'll be out there.

538
00:32:31,906 --> 00:32:33,946
You just make sure my man
got his bread, that's all.

539
00:32:49,141 --> 00:32:50,359
Bye, Rex.

540
00:32:50,403 --> 00:32:52,318
I guess I holler at you later.

541
00:32:52,361 --> 00:32:54,276
Alright? Later.

542
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:25,742
How do you know
that guy out there

543
00:33:25,786 --> 00:33:27,701
that was giving out
them tennis balls?

544
00:33:27,744 --> 00:33:29,181
Cubby told me about him.

545
00:33:29,224 --> 00:33:30,747
Who's Cubby?

546
00:33:30,791 --> 00:33:33,533
He's my friend at school.

547
00:33:33,576 --> 00:33:35,491
He ain't your friend.

548
00:33:43,108 --> 00:33:46,067
You know what a friend is?

549
00:33:46,111 --> 00:33:47,895
Yeah.

550
00:33:47,938 --> 00:33:50,767
No, you think you know
what a friend is, right?

551
00:33:52,943 --> 00:33:54,747
We gonna do this, this is for
all the marbles now!

552
00:33:54,771 --> 00:33:56,164
Ready? Ready?
Here we go.

553
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:57,818
Hut, hike!

554
00:33:57,861 --> 00:33:59,602
Come on, here we go.

555
00:33:59,646 --> 00:34:01,169
Get it! Get the ball,
get it!

556
00:34:01,213 --> 00:34:04,259
Come on! You gotta
be tough!

557
00:34:04,303 --> 00:34:06,479
Slam right, on three.

558
00:34:24,801 --> 00:34:26,064
They're coming in!

559
00:34:26,107 --> 00:34:28,109
There you go... touchdown!

560
00:34:28,153 --> 00:34:30,155
Ha! Come on.

561
00:34:30,198 --> 00:34:33,114
You see those woods over there?

562
00:34:33,158 --> 00:34:34,768
Yeah.

563
00:34:34,811 --> 00:34:36,596
You know what be in them woods?

564
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,467
Birds.

565
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:41,122
You know what be
eating them birds?

566
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:42,776
Cats.

567
00:34:42,819 --> 00:34:44,560
And you know what be
eating them cats?

568
00:34:44,604 --> 00:34:45,909
Dogs.

569
00:34:45,953 --> 00:34:48,042
Let me tell you something.

570
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,740
One day, there was these birds
up in there flying around.

571
00:34:50,784 --> 00:34:53,134
Right?

572
00:34:53,178 --> 00:34:55,832
And they see the cats

573
00:34:55,876 --> 00:34:58,444
and they can see the dogs
coming over the hill.

574
00:34:58,487 --> 00:35:01,577
And they know that the cats
are afraid of the dogs.

575
00:35:01,621 --> 00:35:03,797
So, the bird go down there,

576
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,147
he fly down there to
the boss cat,

577
00:35:06,191 --> 00:35:08,149
and he say to the boss cat,
he goes,

578
00:35:08,193 --> 00:35:11,152
"Listen. I want to make
a deal with you.

579
00:35:11,196 --> 00:35:15,417
"We can see them dogs
coming over that hill.

580
00:35:15,461 --> 00:35:17,680
"So, how about this?"

581
00:35:17,724 --> 00:35:20,814
"We'll warn you, but there's
only one condition to this."

582
00:35:20,857 --> 00:35:24,600
And the cat asked,
"What's that?"

583
00:35:24,644 --> 00:35:26,820
He said, "That you can't eat us."

584
00:35:26,863 --> 00:35:28,517
"You gotta leave us be."

585
00:35:28,561 --> 00:35:29,997
You hear me?

586
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,781
Yeah.

587
00:35:31,825 --> 00:35:34,088
So, the cat thought about this
for a second and said,

588
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,351
"Okay, it's a deal."

589
00:35:36,395 --> 00:35:38,701
So, now the birds and the cats,

590
00:35:38,745 --> 00:35:41,443
they getting along
just fine, right?

591
00:35:41,487 --> 00:35:45,404
Why? Because they ain't got to
worry about the dogs no more.

592
00:35:45,447 --> 00:35:47,232
So, the birds are flying around,

593
00:35:47,275 --> 00:35:49,408
they're watching the cats
who were eating the mouse,

594
00:35:49,451 --> 00:35:51,845
getting all fat and everything.

595
00:35:51,888 --> 00:35:56,458
Laying all about without
a care in the world.

596
00:35:56,502 --> 00:35:59,331
And one day,
the bird come down there,

597
00:35:59,374 --> 00:36:01,855
he fly down on one of
them low branches

598
00:36:01,898 --> 00:36:06,338
and the cat jump up
and bite him on the neck.

599
00:36:06,381 --> 00:36:09,471
So, the bird look up
at the cat, he said,

600
00:36:09,515 --> 00:36:11,604
"Now that you bit me,

601
00:36:11,647 --> 00:36:15,390
"you gotta worry about the dogs
coming over the hill now."

602
00:36:15,434 --> 00:36:18,437
"Why did you do that?"

603
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,657
So, the cat is just
sitting there looking

604
00:36:21,701 --> 00:36:24,878
with this stupid look
on his face.

605
00:36:24,921 --> 00:36:27,881
He said, "It's my nature."

606
00:36:27,924 --> 00:36:30,840
"I'm a cat."

607
00:36:39,284 --> 00:36:40,502
You hear me?

608
00:36:40,546 --> 00:36:42,200
Yeah.

609
00:37:26,635 --> 00:37:27,767
Nursing?

610
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,508
I get my degree in the fall.

611
00:37:29,551 --> 00:37:31,074
The fall? That's good.

612
00:37:31,118 --> 00:37:33,642
I'll be working a whole lot
less hours,

613
00:37:33,686 --> 00:37:35,514
making double what I make now.

614
00:37:35,557 --> 00:37:36,950
You know, sometimes the nurses

615
00:37:36,993 --> 00:37:38,734
are more smarter than the
doctors.

616
00:37:38,778 --> 00:37:40,214
Doctors always be messing up.

617
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,868
I mean, my aunt is
an R.N.

618
00:37:41,911 --> 00:37:44,653
You don't even want to
know the stories.

619
00:37:44,697 --> 00:37:46,612
Right, right.

620
00:37:55,055 --> 00:37:57,927
You really could have
gotten hurt with Derek.

621
00:37:57,971 --> 00:37:59,886
He's got friends.

622
00:38:02,323 --> 00:38:04,586
You know,

623
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,588
if I get hurt,

624
00:38:06,632 --> 00:38:08,677
you can be my nurse.

625
00:38:08,721 --> 00:38:10,636
Right.

626
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:12,638
I'm serious.

627
00:38:12,681 --> 00:38:14,204
Maybe I'll get hurt on purpose.

628
00:38:14,248 --> 00:38:15,834
Maybe you should wait until
I get my degree.

629
00:38:15,858 --> 00:38:18,992
Well, if you ever need
someone to practice on...

630
00:38:29,872 --> 00:38:31,874
You know what?
That champagne don't pop.

631
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:36,357
Can you imagine?

632
00:38:36,401 --> 00:38:39,317
Anyway, so my boss, Frank,

633
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,014
is always, like...

634
00:38:41,057 --> 00:38:45,018
"You know what? I really need
you to clean the menus."

635
00:38:45,061 --> 00:38:46,715
But, I mean, at the same time,

636
00:38:46,759 --> 00:38:48,500
if there's nothing
that's on the menus,

637
00:38:48,543 --> 00:38:51,372
then I'm not going to
clean them, you know?

638
00:38:51,416 --> 00:38:53,809
So, he looks at me and he says,

639
00:38:53,853 --> 00:38:56,029
"Have you cleaned off
all the menus?"

640
00:38:56,072 --> 00:38:58,684
And I say, "Of course I've
cleaned off all the menus."

641
00:38:58,727 --> 00:39:00,599
So, he goes over to
my section, right?

642
00:39:00,642 --> 00:39:02,533
Picks up the menus that are
supposed to be in my section,

643
00:39:02,557 --> 00:39:04,472
gets the menus out... I'll be back.

644
00:39:11,087 --> 00:39:12,611
Yo, what's your problem?

645
00:39:12,654 --> 00:39:14,221
What's my problem?

646
00:39:14,264 --> 00:39:16,528
You like throwing shit
at people? Huh?

647
00:39:16,571 --> 00:39:18,268
Pick that shit up, man.

648
00:39:18,312 --> 00:39:19,966
Why don't you fucking
pick it up, man?

649
00:39:20,009 --> 00:39:22,490
Yo, back the fuck up.
Back the fuck up.

650
00:39:22,534 --> 00:39:24,057
Pick the can up, man.

651
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,059
You ain't got no fucking
respect for yourself.

652
00:39:26,102 --> 00:39:27,495
Pick that motherfucking can up.

653
00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:29,323
Relax, man!

654
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,151
Back the fuck up. What?

655
00:39:31,194 --> 00:39:33,501
This motherfucking
thing over here...

656
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,331
Fuck. What?

657
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,725
What? What?

658
00:39:39,768 --> 00:39:41,422
Back the fuck up.
What?

659
00:39:41,466 --> 00:39:43,685
What? What the fuck you
motherfuckers doing, man?

660
00:39:43,729 --> 00:39:46,384
You'd better go sit the fuck
down somewhere.

661
00:39:46,427 --> 00:39:48,081
Alright.

662
00:39:57,786 --> 00:40:00,615
What the... what the
fuck are you doing?

663
00:40:03,923 --> 00:40:06,404
Fucking Hot Wheels.

664
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:09,363
What the fuck is
that car doing...

665
00:40:34,649 --> 00:40:36,564
Look, I'm sorry about tonight.

666
00:40:38,914 --> 00:40:40,829
That's okay.

667
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,361
Tell Lawrence I said hi.

668
00:41:21,566 --> 00:41:24,482
Vitamin D is from the sun,
so, I mean, that's...

669
00:41:26,048 --> 00:41:27,963
Oh, shit.

670
00:41:31,271 --> 00:41:34,361
You think I'd let you go?

671
00:41:34,404 --> 00:41:35,754
Look, I just want to talk.

672
00:41:35,797 --> 00:41:37,451
I ain't come here for no drama.

673
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:40,802
Put that... you know,
put it to rest, you know?

674
00:41:40,846 --> 00:41:42,369
So, come on, let's
sit down and talk.

675
00:41:42,412 --> 00:41:43,825
I'm not sitting down
with you, Derek.

676
00:41:43,849 --> 00:41:45,217
So, you don't want to
know what happened?

677
00:41:45,241 --> 00:41:46,761
You ain't even gonna
ask what happened?

678
00:41:47,983 --> 00:41:49,221
You ain't got nothing
to do with that?

679
00:41:49,245 --> 00:41:50,638
What happened, Derek?

680
00:41:50,682 --> 00:41:52,248
Oh, you don't know? No, I don't know.

681
00:41:52,292 --> 00:41:54,207
Well, I seen the cat
that you been running with.

682
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:56,775
You think I don't know?
I know everything you're doing.

683
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:00,039
I'm gonna call
the police, Derek.

684
00:42:00,082 --> 00:42:01,693
Oh, you want to call the police?

685
00:42:01,736 --> 00:42:03,782
Alright, come on, now.
Let's talk about C.P.S.

686
00:42:03,825 --> 00:42:05,305
I know all about this cat.

687
00:42:05,348 --> 00:42:07,002
C.P.S. know that he's
around Lawrence,

688
00:42:07,046 --> 00:42:08,917
C.P.S. know that,
hmm?

689
00:42:08,961 --> 00:42:10,832
He's on parole, you tell
his parole officer?

690
00:42:10,876 --> 00:42:12,268
You got a kid?

691
00:42:12,312 --> 00:42:13,724
You think this guy
can keep you safe?

692
00:42:13,748 --> 00:42:15,402
That's what you think?

693
00:42:15,445 --> 00:42:17,883
You think this... you think

694
00:42:17,926 --> 00:42:19,319
gonna do what I do?

695
00:42:19,362 --> 00:42:20,712
This is my job, this is how I...

696
00:42:20,755 --> 00:42:22,496
I don't care about your job.

697
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,256
I don't give a damn
about this job. Please stop.

698
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,239
I don't even want
you working. Please stop.

699
00:42:26,282 --> 00:42:28,260
You don't represent me right.
I don't want you working.

700
00:42:28,284 --> 00:42:30,765
My girls don't work!

701
00:42:30,809 --> 00:42:32,724
Please...

702
00:42:34,987 --> 00:42:36,617
Come on, baby, I don't
mean to make you cry.

703
00:42:36,641 --> 00:42:38,251
Come on, now.

704
00:42:38,294 --> 00:42:40,645
Come on. Let's give it
another chance, right?

705
00:42:40,688 --> 00:42:43,256
Please. Let's work it out,
come on.

706
00:42:43,299 --> 00:42:44,736
Please stop!

707
00:42:44,779 --> 00:42:46,389
Come on, I don't
mean that, come on.

708
00:42:46,433 --> 00:42:47,477
Just one more time!

709
00:42:47,521 --> 00:42:49,654
It's my job.
Please stop!

710
00:42:49,697 --> 00:42:52,004
Alright.

711
00:42:52,047 --> 00:42:54,746
It really mean that much to you.

712
00:42:54,789 --> 00:42:56,704
You fucking that cat?

713
00:43:00,708 --> 00:43:02,014
That's none...

714
00:43:02,057 --> 00:43:03,624
That's none of your
business, Derek.

715
00:43:03,668 --> 00:43:05,452
Oh, it's my business.

716
00:43:05,495 --> 00:43:08,107
I need you to go.
I need you to go.

717
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:09,717
Alright, I'm gonna go.

718
00:43:09,761 --> 00:43:11,632
I love you.

719
00:43:11,676 --> 00:43:13,678
I want to work it out.

720
00:43:13,721 --> 00:43:17,290
Come on, give me
another chance, alright?

721
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:19,031
Please? Just one more time.

722
00:43:19,074 --> 00:43:21,294
Please, Derek, please go.

723
00:43:21,337 --> 00:43:22,730
Why don't you tell that cat

724
00:43:22,774 --> 00:43:24,689
it ain't over.

725
00:43:38,224 --> 00:43:40,139
How you doing today, B.?

726
00:43:40,182 --> 00:43:41,793
What's up?

727
00:43:41,836 --> 00:43:43,292
Ah, we'd just like to
have a word with you,

728
00:43:43,316 --> 00:43:44,709
talk with you for a few minutes.

729
00:43:44,752 --> 00:43:46,667
How you doing today?

730
00:43:46,711 --> 00:43:48,887
Mind if I call you "Earl"?

731
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:50,323
Let me ask you about somebody.

732
00:43:50,366 --> 00:43:51,977
You know a guy
named Derek Young?

733
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,718
Yeah, I know a Derek Young.

734
00:43:53,761 --> 00:43:55,328
You know him, right?

735
00:43:55,371 --> 00:43:56,895
How well do you know him?

736
00:43:56,938 --> 00:43:58,418
Not at all.

737
00:43:58,461 --> 00:44:00,202
I don't know.
I got somebody said

738
00:44:00,246 --> 00:44:02,093
you guys were having rough sex
in the back of Beamer's

739
00:44:02,117 --> 00:44:03,510
on Thursday night.

740
00:44:03,553 --> 00:44:05,773
I was asleep, man.

741
00:44:05,817 --> 00:44:07,253
You go to bed early, huh?

742
00:44:07,296 --> 00:44:08,646
Sleeping by yourself?

743
00:44:08,689 --> 00:44:10,691
Watching Debbie Does Dallas?

744
00:44:10,735 --> 00:44:12,432
You ever hear of a kid
named Donald Weams?

745
00:44:12,475 --> 00:44:14,695
He's dead.

746
00:44:14,739 --> 00:44:16,958
Wasn't he the guy that was
dealing to your sister

747
00:44:17,002 --> 00:44:18,917
when you were in prison?

748
00:44:21,397 --> 00:44:23,356
Like his sister?

749
00:44:23,399 --> 00:44:26,315
Don't remember, huh?

750
00:44:26,359 --> 00:44:29,101
- Don't remember him at all?
- Never heard about this?

751
00:44:29,144 --> 00:44:32,408
You didn't hear that she got a
hotshot from old Donald?

752
00:44:32,452 --> 00:44:35,847
That would piss me off.
Piss you off?

753
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:38,763
You know what? Let me
tell y'all something.

754
00:44:38,806 --> 00:44:40,895
I feel sorry for y'all.

755
00:44:40,939 --> 00:44:42,114
Is that right?

756
00:44:42,157 --> 00:44:44,290
Yeah. 'Cause y'all are off.

757
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:45,552
Y'all are way off.

758
00:44:45,595 --> 00:44:47,293
Alright, listen, listen.

759
00:44:47,336 --> 00:44:48,773
Earl.

760
00:44:48,816 --> 00:44:51,123
What I need you to do
from now on,

761
00:44:51,166 --> 00:44:53,429
don't do police work,
don't do what you're doing.

762
00:44:53,473 --> 00:44:54,822
Leave it to us. Okay?

763
00:44:54,866 --> 00:44:56,824
You got a problem,
anything going on,

764
00:44:56,868 --> 00:44:58,783
I know you want to
protect the neighbourhood

765
00:44:58,826 --> 00:45:00,480
and all that stuff,
it's all good.

766
00:45:00,523 --> 00:45:02,545
But you pick up the phone,
you call us, you understand?

767
00:45:02,569 --> 00:45:04,571
You know already the rules
of this game, man.

768
00:45:04,614 --> 00:45:06,268
You been up north
for how many years?

769
00:45:06,312 --> 00:45:07,752
You know if you got
any kind of issue

770
00:45:07,792 --> 00:45:09,619
you know it's gonna be
called to us,

771
00:45:09,663 --> 00:45:11,447
let us do what we
supposed to do, man.

772
00:45:11,491 --> 00:45:13,711
How much they gonna charge me
to do that?

773
00:45:13,754 --> 00:45:15,974
Hold up, hold up, now you're
acting like an asshole.

774
00:45:16,017 --> 00:45:18,150
What the fuck you talking
about, man?

775
00:45:18,193 --> 00:45:19,891
That's how it is, man.

776
00:45:19,934 --> 00:45:21,066
What you talking about...

777
00:45:21,109 --> 00:45:22,763
What ways, what ways, what is?

778
00:45:25,766 --> 00:45:27,159
Put that fucking thought across

779
00:45:27,202 --> 00:45:28,987
that we're doing
something wrong.

780
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:31,032
I will drag your fucking ass
down to the station

781
00:45:31,076 --> 00:45:32,468
in two fucking seconds!

782
00:45:32,512 --> 00:45:34,209
I could take you down
right fucking now

783
00:45:34,253 --> 00:45:35,950
and put you in the back
of that fucking car

784
00:45:35,994 --> 00:45:37,623
no fucking problem, man,
you understand me?

785
00:45:37,647 --> 00:45:39,388
You understand me?

786
00:45:39,432 --> 00:45:41,236
You're lucky you're walking
away from this right now,

787
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:42,914
so shut the fuck up!

788
00:45:42,957 --> 00:45:44,892
You look I'm calming
this motherfucker down right now

789
00:45:44,916 --> 00:45:47,179
because you know... you know you
definitely don't want to

790
00:45:47,222 --> 00:45:49,921
get locked the fuck back up,
man. You know it.

791
00:45:49,964 --> 00:45:51,661
Three strikes, Earl?

792
00:45:51,705 --> 00:45:53,620
Tough guy.

793
00:46:04,805 --> 00:46:06,894
Aw, man.

794
00:46:06,938 --> 00:46:08,809
Mylo?

795
00:46:08,853 --> 00:46:10,028
What up, Earl?

796
00:46:10,071 --> 00:46:11,420
What are you doing
out here, man?

797
00:46:11,464 --> 00:46:12,963
What do you mean what
am I doing out here?

798
00:46:12,987 --> 00:46:14,946
What are you doing out here?
My girl lives here.

799
00:46:14,989 --> 00:46:16,991
I hear you swiping
benefit cards.

800
00:46:17,035 --> 00:46:18,776
You see there's 20
families out here, man.

801
00:46:18,819 --> 00:46:21,300
You getting $100 a pop.
That's $2000 a month.

802
00:46:21,343 --> 00:46:23,955
$2000 a month is peanuts, man.

803
00:46:23,998 --> 00:46:25,260
I'm out of here.

804
00:46:25,304 --> 00:46:26,740
It ain't right, man.

805
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,437
What the fuck you mean
it ain't right?

806
00:46:28,481 --> 00:46:30,241
You better back up, man.
This shit is bigger than you.

807
00:46:30,265 --> 00:46:32,224
The game is over,
you're out of here.

808
00:46:32,267 --> 00:46:34,704
I said get out of here, man.
Yo, Earl, man!

809
00:46:37,882 --> 00:46:39,448
Come on, man!

810
00:46:39,492 --> 00:46:40,686
You're getting
out of here. Let my arm go!

811
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:42,060
You're getting out of here.

812
00:46:42,103 --> 00:46:43,496
Yo, this ain't even me, man.

813
00:46:43,539 --> 00:46:44,845
It's Wescott's shit, man!

814
00:46:44,889 --> 00:46:45,846
Wescott?

815
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:47,674
Yeah, man!

816
00:46:47,717 --> 00:46:49,502
Let me go!

817
00:46:49,545 --> 00:46:50,895
Ah. Fuck.

818
00:46:50,938 --> 00:46:52,002
Let me tell you something, man.

819
00:46:52,026 --> 00:46:53,201
Get off!

820
00:46:53,245 --> 00:46:55,290
Get the fuck up
out of here, man.

821
00:46:55,334 --> 00:46:56,465
You gonna get your shit...

822
00:46:56,509 --> 00:46:57,597
Get the fuck out of here!

823
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,381
You hear me?
It's over.

824
00:47:01,253 --> 00:47:02,602
I'm getting tired.

825
00:47:02,645 --> 00:47:04,430
Word?
Word, man.

826
00:47:04,473 --> 00:47:06,258
Yo, where's Wescott at?

827
00:47:06,301 --> 00:47:08,434
Earl, man, don't bring that
bullshit up in here, man.

828
00:47:08,477 --> 00:47:10,218
Shit, man!

829
00:47:10,262 --> 00:47:12,220
Yo, where the fuck is Wescott?

830
00:47:12,264 --> 00:47:14,179
What the fuck is popping?

831
00:47:14,222 --> 00:47:15,896
Don't come down Columbia no more
with that bullshit.

832
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,280
This stuff's not in
your fucking...

833
00:47:17,312 --> 00:47:19,184
You finished.
You? Fuck you.

834
00:47:19,227 --> 00:47:20,794
Shut the fuck up!

835
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,752
Your boy coming down there
at Columbia Apartment

836
00:47:22,796 --> 00:47:24,450
swiping benefit cards, alright?

837
00:47:24,493 --> 00:47:25,886
That shit is over.

838
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:27,235
You don't run shit around here!

839
00:47:27,279 --> 00:47:29,237
I'm telling you... You know...

840
00:47:29,281 --> 00:47:30,456
Stop it, motherfucker.

841
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,784
What the fuck you gonna do?
What the fuck you gonna do?

842
00:47:34,808 --> 00:47:36,636
What the fuck you gonna do?
What? What?

843
00:47:39,813 --> 00:47:41,641
Fuck! What? Bring it.

844
00:47:45,645 --> 00:47:47,995
Don't disrespect me.
Go ahead.

845
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:50,432
I don't want to see that
no more!

846
00:47:50,476 --> 00:47:52,608
You'd better fucking
control your boys!

847
00:47:52,652 --> 00:47:56,090
Fuck you, man! I'd better not
see you around there again.

848
00:47:56,134 --> 00:47:58,440
Control your fucking boys.
It's over!

849
00:47:58,484 --> 00:48:00,268
They ain't making a
motherfucking thing

850
00:48:00,312 --> 00:48:03,793
no more.
It's over.

851
00:48:03,837 --> 00:48:07,667
Fucking nobody.
It's over.

852
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:10,278
I see you down there again,
you going to hell.

853
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:16,154
You know a kid
named Donald Weams?

854
00:48:16,197 --> 00:48:17,372
The kid that got killed?

855
00:48:17,416 --> 00:48:18,634
Yeah, that's right.

856
00:48:18,678 --> 00:48:21,768
Nah, um, what are you
asking me for?

857
00:48:21,811 --> 00:48:23,248
Donald had, uh, some kids

858
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:24,442
who were selling crack for him

859
00:48:24,466 --> 00:48:25,598
down at the high school.

860
00:48:25,641 --> 00:48:27,121
Well, that wasn't Lawrence.

861
00:48:27,165 --> 00:48:29,254
Would you mind if he
took a drug test?

862
00:48:29,297 --> 00:48:30,951
Yes, I do mind.

863
00:48:30,995 --> 00:48:33,214
You know kids 9, 10 years old

864
00:48:33,258 --> 00:48:36,087
getting high, smoking, doing all
kinds of nonsense out here?

865
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:38,480
Well, Lawrence isn't into that.

866
00:48:38,524 --> 00:48:41,179
It's only a drug test.

867
00:48:41,222 --> 00:48:44,095
Hey, there he is.
How are you, buddy?

868
00:48:44,138 --> 00:48:45,835
How you doing?
Come on over.

869
00:48:45,879 --> 00:48:47,204
You mind if I talk to him
for a sec?

870
00:48:47,228 --> 00:48:49,230
Good looking kid.
Looks like his mom.

871
00:48:49,274 --> 00:48:51,754
Come here, buddy. I gotta ask
you a couple questions, okay?

872
00:48:51,798 --> 00:48:53,167
You know a guy named
Earl Coleman, Lawrence?

873
00:48:53,191 --> 00:48:54,429
Lawrence, go back to your room.

874
00:48:54,453 --> 00:48:55,976
Lawrence, come here, it's okay.

875
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:57,301
It's okay, I'm not
going to bite you.

876
00:48:57,325 --> 00:48:58,848
Come here.
Big guy, right?

877
00:48:58,892 --> 00:49:00,391
You ever throw a football
around with him?

878
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:01,697
I thought this was about
the kid in the woods.

879
00:49:01,721 --> 00:49:03,114
It is.

880
00:49:13,428 --> 00:49:14,995
Hey.

881
00:49:17,563 --> 00:49:19,130
Sorry for coming over so late.

882
00:49:19,173 --> 00:49:20,522
That's no problem.

883
00:49:20,566 --> 00:49:22,481
Can I get you something?

884
00:49:26,702 --> 00:49:29,618
Did you kill that guy?
The one they found in the park?

885
00:49:32,273 --> 00:49:34,972
I didn't kill nobody.

886
00:49:35,015 --> 00:49:36,495
Who said that?

887
00:49:36,538 --> 00:49:38,497
These two detectives,
they came by my house.

888
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:41,326
They're just looking for
somebody to pin this on.

889
00:49:41,369 --> 00:49:42,892
I just got out of jail,

890
00:49:42,936 --> 00:49:44,372
so they're
looking for a scapegoat

891
00:49:44,416 --> 00:49:45,852
and I'm an easy target.

892
00:49:45,895 --> 00:49:48,376
I just wanted you to be careful.

893
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:55,035
Look, I'm sorry about
the other night.

894
00:49:55,079 --> 00:49:56,994
Yeah?

895
00:50:04,523 --> 00:50:08,222
Earl, listen.

896
00:50:08,266 --> 00:50:12,096
I can't be with a guy like you.

897
00:50:12,139 --> 00:50:13,401
Why is that?

898
00:50:13,445 --> 00:50:16,404
You could go to jail.

899
00:50:16,448 --> 00:50:18,189
Do you ever think about that?

900
00:50:18,232 --> 00:50:19,470
That ain't happening,
I ain't going to jail.

901
00:50:19,494 --> 00:50:20,558
Oh, you're not going to jail?

902
00:50:20,582 --> 00:50:22,193
Let me tell you something.

903
00:50:22,236 --> 00:50:24,171
The people that I see,
the people that I come across,

904
00:50:24,195 --> 00:50:26,719
they ain't going to go back
and tell anybody anything.

905
00:50:26,762 --> 00:50:28,068
Nobody cares.

906
00:50:28,112 --> 00:50:30,505
I gotta be going.

907
00:50:30,549 --> 00:50:32,464
Lawrence is waiting for me.

908
00:51:44,971 --> 00:51:46,668
She probably all
busted out, man.

909
00:51:46,712 --> 00:51:47,887
What?

910
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:49,280
Man, once a chick
has a kid, man,

911
00:51:49,323 --> 00:51:51,282
it changes up the whole story.

912
00:51:51,325 --> 00:51:53,129
It's like there's some weird
obsession with the kid, man.

913
00:51:53,153 --> 00:51:54,676
It's like that's
all she cares about.

914
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,982
Lawrence is a good kid.

915
00:51:56,025 --> 00:51:57,549
Man, fuck Lawrence!

916
00:51:57,592 --> 00:51:59,004
What are you talking about,
Lawrence is a good kid, man?

917
00:51:59,028 --> 00:52:00,334
Lawrence don't know shit!

918
00:52:00,378 --> 00:52:02,031
I've dated bitches
that have kids, man.

919
00:52:02,075 --> 00:52:04,817
It ain't nothing but
turmoil and trouble, man.

920
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:06,688
But you know what?

921
00:52:06,732 --> 00:52:08,777
You my boy.

922
00:52:08,821 --> 00:52:11,824
I'm gonna help you out, man,
I'm gonna help you out.

923
00:52:11,867 --> 00:52:13,260
And how's that?

924
00:52:13,304 --> 00:52:14,957
What the fuck's
her name, Keisha?

925
00:52:15,001 --> 00:52:16,785
I'm gonna take Keisha out,

926
00:52:16,829 --> 00:52:18,439
that's what I'm gonna
do for you.

927
00:52:18,483 --> 00:52:20,374
You know what I mean? Just to
warm her up a little bit.

928
00:52:20,398 --> 00:52:23,140
See what she's about.
Take her on a date,

929
00:52:23,183 --> 00:52:24,141
give her roses.

930
00:52:24,184 --> 00:52:25,664
'Cause women love roses.

931
00:52:25,707 --> 00:52:28,275
See, Keisha is like my mother
when I was a kid.

932
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:29,624
If you gave her some roses,

933
00:52:29,668 --> 00:52:31,191
she gonna suck your dick.

934
00:52:31,235 --> 00:52:32,560
I used to go to
sleep to that, man.

935
00:52:32,584 --> 00:52:34,151
But that's besides the point.

936
00:52:34,194 --> 00:52:36,892
So, I'd get these... I'd get
Keisha these roses.

937
00:52:36,936 --> 00:52:40,505
She gonna suck my dick.
For you, though.

938
00:52:40,548 --> 00:52:42,985
Fellatio.
Shit.

939
00:52:43,029 --> 00:52:44,702
This is for you, man.
This is for you, calm down.

940
00:52:44,726 --> 00:52:46,293
See if she's up to speed,

941
00:52:46,337 --> 00:52:47,923
'cause you don't want
to be dating no bitch

942
00:52:47,947 --> 00:52:49,209
that's not up to speed, man.

943
00:52:49,253 --> 00:52:50,404
She gonna suck my dick
for that fellatio

944
00:52:50,428 --> 00:52:52,038
and we be all good.

945
00:52:52,081 --> 00:52:55,084
Man, if you don't get
the hell out of here...

946
00:52:55,128 --> 00:52:56,564
I'm just saying, brother, like,

947
00:52:56,608 --> 00:52:58,523
you don't think it's a good...

948
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:30,903
What's up, man?

949
00:53:30,946 --> 00:53:32,948
I don't know, man.

950
00:53:32,992 --> 00:53:34,950
She might be broke down
or something, man.

951
00:53:34,994 --> 00:53:36,648
I don't know.
A couple wires loose,

952
00:53:36,691 --> 00:53:38,258
lights went out. Yeah?

953
00:53:38,302 --> 00:53:39,999
Problem might be back here.

954
00:53:40,042 --> 00:53:41,000
Back where?

955
00:53:41,043 --> 00:53:42,958
Back over this way.

956
00:53:49,095 --> 00:53:50,227
What?

957
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:51,228
Get this motherfucker.

958
00:53:51,271 --> 00:53:53,926
Derek! Derek!

959
00:55:46,517 --> 00:55:48,606
Bring that bitch out!

960
00:55:48,649 --> 00:55:50,695
Bring his ass out!
Bring him out now!

961
00:55:50,738 --> 00:55:52,261
I want you!
Come on, now!

962
00:55:52,305 --> 00:55:54,089
Bring that bitch out now!

963
00:55:54,133 --> 00:55:56,396
You think...
What you thinking, man?

964
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:57,702
You think I wouldn't be back?

965
00:55:57,745 --> 00:55:59,356
That's what you thought?

966
00:55:59,399 --> 00:56:00,811
That's what you thought,
I wouldn't be back?

967
00:56:00,835 --> 00:56:02,271
You think you can fuck
with my girl?

968
00:56:02,315 --> 00:56:04,317
Fuck no!
Hell no!

969
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:06,232
Who the fuck do you
think you are?

970
00:56:06,275 --> 00:56:07,668
You want to make
fucking sheriff?

971
00:56:07,712 --> 00:56:09,801
That's what you think?
You think...

972
00:56:11,324 --> 00:56:13,084
You! A fucking broke-ass
motherfucker like you!

973
00:56:13,108 --> 00:56:15,415
You ain't in my league!
I'll fucking kill you!

974
00:56:15,459 --> 00:56:16,590
Get him!

975
00:56:16,634 --> 00:56:17,896
Never, never!

976
00:56:17,939 --> 00:56:19,419
She's mine! She's mine!

977
00:56:19,463 --> 00:56:21,334
God dammit, she's mine!

978
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:23,336
Open his mouth!
Open your mouth, bitch.

979
00:59:52,501 --> 00:59:54,329
Hey.

980
00:59:54,373 --> 00:59:57,463
How you doing?

981
00:59:57,506 --> 00:59:59,421
Can I talk to you for a minute?

982
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:04,035
Sure.

983
01:00:06,211 --> 01:00:08,430
What you said to me
made a lot of sense.

984
01:00:08,474 --> 01:00:12,521
But how am I supposed to
believe you?

985
01:00:12,565 --> 01:00:16,700
Because I'm asking you
to give me another chance.

986
01:00:16,743 --> 01:00:19,354
You can't do this for me.

987
01:00:19,398 --> 01:00:21,095
You have to want to change.

988
01:00:21,139 --> 01:00:23,576
You can't do this for me
regardless of what I do.

989
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,230
Okay.

990
01:00:25,273 --> 01:00:28,363
Okay what?

991
01:00:28,407 --> 01:00:30,888
I mean, me doing what I do,

992
01:00:30,931 --> 01:00:33,238
it's causing nobody

993
01:00:33,281 --> 01:00:37,459
harm and problems but myself.

994
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:38,765
And...

995
01:00:38,809 --> 01:00:43,074
I can't just think I can...

996
01:00:43,117 --> 01:00:45,642
change the world like that.

997
01:00:49,428 --> 01:00:51,299
Well...

998
01:00:51,343 --> 01:00:55,173
I gotta stop
letting things get to me.

999
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:58,567
You're right.

1000
01:00:58,611 --> 01:01:01,222
You can't keep letting these
things get you down and bothered

1001
01:01:01,266 --> 01:01:04,878
and messing with your life
that you're trying to create.

1002
01:01:10,101 --> 01:01:11,711
So how are we doing?

1003
01:01:21,025 --> 01:01:22,940
Earl.

1004
01:01:25,507 --> 01:01:26,639
Paycheque.

1005
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:28,075
And I gave you a raise.

1006
01:01:28,119 --> 01:01:30,251
What's this for?

1007
01:01:30,295 --> 01:01:33,472
Oh, because you're a bad worker
with a shitty attitude

1008
01:01:33,515 --> 01:01:36,301
and I feel sorry for you.

1009
01:01:36,344 --> 01:01:38,259
Okay.

1010
01:03:42,383 --> 01:03:44,646
So this is your sister's place?

1011
01:03:44,690 --> 01:03:46,953
Yeah.

1012
01:03:46,997 --> 01:03:50,522
She died four months
before I got out.

1013
01:03:50,565 --> 01:03:53,481
And they let you
take over the lease?

1014
01:03:55,527 --> 01:03:58,791
- I know the landlord.
- I used to live here.

1015
01:04:00,575 --> 01:04:04,623
Hm. Do they have
any two-bedrooms?

1016
01:04:04,666 --> 01:04:07,278
Yeah, they have
some two-bedrooms

1017
01:04:07,321 --> 01:04:09,236
but they're going
for like, around 1100.

1018
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:13,197
Oh, really?
That would be nice.

1019
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:14,241
Yeah.

1020
01:04:14,285 --> 01:04:18,550
Hey, I can ask Mike about it

1021
01:04:18,593 --> 01:04:22,249
and, um, I'll let you know
something tomorrow.

1022
01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:33,739
You know it's not
your fault, right?

1023
01:04:33,782 --> 01:04:37,134
I know.

1024
01:04:37,177 --> 01:04:40,920
But if I wasn't in jail,
this would have never happened.

1025
01:04:44,315 --> 01:04:46,230
You're just feeling guilty.

1026
01:04:49,015 --> 01:04:52,192
Feeling guilty
makes you a better person.

1027
01:04:52,236 --> 01:04:54,586
Makes you realize.

1028
01:06:12,359 --> 01:06:14,231
You just made it worse!

1029
01:06:14,274 --> 01:06:15,710
Excuse me?

1030
01:06:15,754 --> 01:06:17,103
What you did.

1031
01:06:17,147 --> 01:06:19,932
Now they upped the payment
to 150 a month.

1032
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:22,891
Hundred and fifty?
Hundred and fifty to who?

1033
01:06:22,935 --> 01:06:24,545
To Mylo and them!

1034
01:06:24,589 --> 01:06:27,461
We complained and now
they upped the payment.

1035
01:06:27,505 --> 01:06:30,073
I don't know what we gonna do.

1036
01:06:30,116 --> 01:06:33,598
I'm sorry about that.

1037
01:06:33,641 --> 01:06:37,689
Ain't nothing you can do?

1038
01:06:37,732 --> 01:06:40,692
Maybe it's best
I just stayed out of it.

1039
01:06:40,735 --> 01:06:44,000
You mean to tell me you
not gonna talk to them again?

1040
01:06:45,784 --> 01:06:48,221
Look, why don't you
call the police, you know?

1041
01:06:48,265 --> 01:06:50,180
Maybe they can help.

1042
01:06:55,620 --> 01:06:57,187
What's wrong with y'all, man?

1043
01:06:57,230 --> 01:06:59,058
Why you niggers frowning?

1044
01:06:59,102 --> 01:07:01,800
Well, you know you left
a nice little surprise

1045
01:07:01,843 --> 01:07:04,107
for us this morning, man.

1046
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:05,693
Real, real nice leaving
that body out there like that.

1047
01:07:05,717 --> 01:07:07,371
Yo, last time I checked,

1048
01:07:07,414 --> 01:07:09,349
it was you motherfuckers' job
to take care of Rex.

1049
01:07:09,373 --> 01:07:11,592
You niggers must need
a new profession or something.

1050
01:07:11,636 --> 01:07:13,072
Now, we in the right profession.

1051
01:07:13,116 --> 01:07:14,900
See, we clean up
your fucking mess, man,

1052
01:07:14,943 --> 01:07:16,530
you know what I'm saying? And
when you do shit like this,

1053
01:07:16,554 --> 01:07:17,990
you got to
come to us first, man.

1054
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:19,383
What the fuck
am I supposed to do?

1055
01:07:19,426 --> 01:07:21,167
I'm supposed to stand around

1056
01:07:21,211 --> 01:07:23,909
while this motherfucker Rex
is pumping beats on my strip?

1057
01:07:23,952 --> 01:07:25,824
Nigger's bodying my soldiers?

1058
01:07:25,867 --> 01:07:27,521
Rex been nipping
at my heels for months.

1059
01:07:27,565 --> 01:07:29,262
And what y'all do?

1060
01:07:29,306 --> 01:07:31,153
What about that girl that was
gonna turn State's evidence?

1061
01:07:31,177 --> 01:07:32,570
We gave you that girl.

1062
01:07:32,613 --> 01:07:33,764
Motherfucker,
that's why you get paid.

1063
01:07:33,788 --> 01:07:35,486
Hold up, man.

1064
01:07:35,529 --> 01:07:37,638
You gonna act like straight
like a fucking asshole, man.

1065
01:07:37,662 --> 01:07:39,794
You ain't talking to
any motherfucker about it.

1066
01:07:39,838 --> 01:07:41,840
You ain't just rate
regular corner niggers.

1067
01:07:41,883 --> 01:07:43,755
Ain't nobody soft
over here, man.

1068
01:07:43,798 --> 01:07:45,148
Not my corner nigger, right?

1069
01:07:45,191 --> 01:07:46,975
Well, who the fuck
got you eating lavish?

1070
01:07:47,019 --> 01:07:48,064
Answer that shit.

1071
01:07:48,107 --> 01:07:50,022
All right, all right, enough.

1072
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:51,502
All right.
Bottom line here is,

1073
01:07:51,545 --> 01:07:53,808
you're not gonna start a war
in our district.

1074
01:07:53,852 --> 01:07:55,438
You're not dumping bodies
in our district, okay, Ulysses?

1075
01:07:55,462 --> 01:07:57,290
You got that?

1076
01:07:57,334 --> 01:07:59,138
I got a business to run and
I'm gonna do whatever the fuck

1077
01:07:59,162 --> 01:08:00,791
I gotta do to make sure
my shit runs right.

1078
01:08:00,815 --> 01:08:02,382
Now you listen to me.

1079
01:08:02,426 --> 01:08:04,645
You start acting like
some fucking crackhead,

1080
01:08:04,689 --> 01:08:06,691
we got a problem,
you understand me?

1081
01:08:06,734 --> 01:08:08,127
And that's what
you've been doing.

1082
01:08:08,171 --> 01:08:09,496
We gave you
too many passes, Ulysses.

1083
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:11,130
What the fuck are you
talking about?

1084
01:08:11,174 --> 01:08:13,132
This thing's gonna collapse
if you fuck around!

1085
01:08:13,176 --> 01:08:15,482
You start doing whatever
you fucking want to do,

1086
01:08:15,526 --> 01:08:17,093
it's gonna collapse.

1087
01:08:19,443 --> 01:08:20,922
So you got a game plan, huh?

1088
01:08:20,966 --> 01:08:22,185
Yeah!

1089
01:08:24,491 --> 01:08:26,319
This is my point.

1090
01:08:26,363 --> 01:08:29,931
As far as your fucking game
plan, the game plan is,

1091
01:08:29,975 --> 01:08:32,891
is if y'all motherfuckers
are gonna take my money,

1092
01:08:32,934 --> 01:08:36,155
shut the fuck up
and earn your keep.

1093
01:08:56,044 --> 01:08:58,177
- Hey, buddy!
- What's going on, buddy?

1094
01:08:58,221 --> 01:09:00,658
How you doing today?
Good to see you.

1095
01:09:00,701 --> 01:09:02,921
Everything all right?

1096
01:09:02,964 --> 01:09:04,531
Are we still like that?

1097
01:09:04,575 --> 01:09:06,054
Listen, man.
What you want?

1098
01:09:06,098 --> 01:09:08,056
We need to talk. For what?

1099
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:10,276
We gotta talk about this.

1100
01:09:12,409 --> 01:09:14,280
Glad to see you
cleaned up for us.

1101
01:09:14,324 --> 01:09:16,543
You have any weapons
around this motherfucker, boy?

1102
01:09:16,587 --> 01:09:17,805
You hear about Rex Raynor?

1103
01:09:17,849 --> 01:09:19,242
Everybody did.

1104
01:09:19,285 --> 01:09:20,852
Mm-hm. I told you,

1105
01:09:20,895 --> 01:09:23,159
you're go start doing
that vigilante shit,

1106
01:09:23,202 --> 01:09:25,552
it's gonna come back
at you, bro.

1107
01:09:25,596 --> 01:09:26,988
I ain't into that anymore.

1108
01:09:27,032 --> 01:09:28,207
Mm?

1109
01:09:28,251 --> 01:09:29,382
That's your job.

1110
01:09:29,426 --> 01:09:31,210
What are you saying, you done?

1111
01:09:31,254 --> 01:09:33,604
Done just like that.
Is that what you're saying?

1112
01:09:33,647 --> 01:09:35,823
I got other things
going on, man.

1113
01:09:35,867 --> 01:09:37,216
Like?

1114
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:38,652
I work for a living.

1115
01:09:38,696 --> 01:09:40,263
What you need to be looking at

1116
01:09:40,306 --> 01:09:42,874
is Mylo Shrugs over there
in the Columbia Apartments.

1117
01:09:42,917 --> 01:09:44,547
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.
We'll look into that.

1118
01:09:44,571 --> 01:09:46,094
Got the people
down there terrified.

1119
01:09:46,138 --> 01:09:47,400
All right. Got it.

1120
01:09:47,444 --> 01:09:50,577
My friend, take a look at this.

1121
01:09:50,621 --> 01:09:52,623
You know what that's from?

1122
01:09:52,666 --> 01:09:54,886
That's from Derek Young.

1123
01:09:54,929 --> 01:09:58,890
He came by the station this
morning, said you assaulted him

1124
01:09:58,933 --> 01:10:00,718
last week in the parking lot
in Beamers.

1125
01:10:00,761 --> 01:10:02,633
And then he said
he was gonna let it go

1126
01:10:02,676 --> 01:10:04,809
and then you came by
and decided to do it again.

1127
01:10:04,852 --> 01:10:06,114
He's lying.

1128
01:10:06,158 --> 01:10:08,073
That's a first-degree assault.

1129
01:10:08,116 --> 01:10:10,293
That's a third strike for you.
He's got a witness

1130
01:10:10,336 --> 01:10:12,120
and the witness said
you went after him, too.

1131
01:10:12,164 --> 01:10:13,600
Who's that?

1132
01:10:13,644 --> 01:10:15,776
Same guy you jumped.
You tell me who's that.

1133
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:17,256
Mm-hm. Read the piece of paper.

1134
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:19,191
You know what happens to
three-time losers, baby.

1135
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:22,130
Well, you know,
we've left Ulysses man

1136
01:10:22,174 --> 01:10:24,481
for quite some time
right now, you know.

1137
01:10:24,524 --> 01:10:26,396
Let me just say something
about your sister

1138
01:10:26,439 --> 01:10:29,007
real quick here, man, 'cause
this correlates with Ulysses.

1139
01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:31,575
She's on her way
to becoming a CI, man.

1140
01:10:31,618 --> 01:10:34,055
She's trying to come
work with us to help you.

1141
01:10:34,099 --> 01:10:35,492
What are you talking about, man?

1142
01:10:35,535 --> 01:10:37,189
We're saying we don't blame you

1143
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:38,993
for what's starting to
happen to Ulysses' guys.

1144
01:10:39,017 --> 01:10:41,324
I mean, your sister
was a hell of a woman.

1145
01:10:41,367 --> 01:10:44,457
And what happened to my sister
happened to your sister.

1146
01:10:44,501 --> 01:10:45,826
I could see why you'd be
doing what you're doing.

1147
01:10:45,850 --> 01:10:47,286
My sister ain't no snitch, man.

1148
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:48,722
She ain't telling on nobody.

1149
01:10:48,766 --> 01:10:50,507
Who put you away?

1150
01:10:50,550 --> 01:10:52,615
Tell me that she wouldn't
want to take him down for that.

1151
01:10:52,639 --> 01:10:53,901
She did.

1152
01:10:53,945 --> 01:10:55,729
She wanted to get you paroled.

1153
01:10:55,773 --> 01:10:57,122
Wanted you home, man.

1154
01:10:57,165 --> 01:10:58,819
And then all of a sudden
she comes to us

1155
01:10:58,863 --> 01:11:00,884
talking about getting you parole
and guess what happens?

1156
01:11:00,908 --> 01:11:02,910
She gets a hotshot.

1157
01:11:02,954 --> 01:11:05,348
You think Skull was the only one
behind that shit?

1158
01:11:05,391 --> 01:11:07,828
Tell you what, man.

1159
01:11:07,872 --> 01:11:10,875
Tomorrow morning, man,
you need to be at the precinct

1160
01:11:10,918 --> 01:11:14,008
around nine o'clock.
AM, not nine o'clock PM.

1161
01:11:14,052 --> 01:11:15,793
9 AM.

1162
01:11:15,836 --> 01:11:18,665
You tend to dance to your own
motherfuckering scheduled tunes.

1163
01:11:18,709 --> 01:11:20,493
9 AM.

1164
01:11:22,190 --> 01:11:23,844
Listen, my friend.

1165
01:11:23,888 --> 01:11:25,542
I want to talk to you
about something.

1166
01:11:25,585 --> 01:11:27,021
He brought your sister to me

1167
01:11:27,065 --> 01:11:28,545
when all this stuff
was going down.

1168
01:11:28,588 --> 01:11:29,937
She's a good girl.

1169
01:11:29,981 --> 01:11:32,723
She got herself clean, man.
She did a 180.

1170
01:11:32,766 --> 01:11:34,396
Do you have any idea what
Ulysses and those guys

1171
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:36,074
did to her when she was using?

1172
01:11:36,117 --> 01:11:38,816
Forget it. And the shit she had
to do to get drugs, man?

1173
01:11:38,859 --> 01:11:40,513
My sister?

1174
01:11:40,557 --> 01:11:43,255
I can't even tell you
how I feel about it.

1175
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:45,039
Man-to-man,

1176
01:11:45,083 --> 01:11:48,565
you go seeking some sort of
retribution this time...

1177
01:11:49,957 --> 01:11:52,308
it's okay with me.

1178
01:11:52,351 --> 01:11:54,658
You got my blessings, bro.

1179
01:11:54,701 --> 01:11:56,921
I'll see you tomorrow.

1180
01:12:11,283 --> 01:12:12,545
Hey, Scott.

1181
01:12:12,589 --> 01:12:13,938
Hey, how you doing?

1182
01:12:13,981 --> 01:12:16,070
All right. Yo, listen.

1183
01:12:16,114 --> 01:12:18,508
Um, you still got that apartment
available over there

1184
01:12:18,551 --> 01:12:20,205
in building five?

1185
01:12:20,248 --> 01:12:22,250
I think it is available
but I think it's 1150.

1186
01:12:22,294 --> 01:12:24,209
I'll check for you.

1187
01:12:24,252 --> 01:12:25,819
I got someone who's interested.

1188
01:12:25,863 --> 01:12:27,473
Is it all right
if I bring them by?

1189
01:12:27,517 --> 01:12:29,214
Yeah, definitely.

1190
01:12:29,257 --> 01:12:31,577
But try to make it in the next
hour, all right, if you can?

1191
01:12:31,608 --> 01:12:33,261
All right. All right. Thanks.

1192
01:12:38,179 --> 01:12:39,398
Hey, Keisha, what's up?

1193
01:12:39,442 --> 01:12:40,530
Hey.

1194
01:12:40,573 --> 01:12:42,270
Yeah, listen.
I spoke to him.

1195
01:12:42,314 --> 01:12:43,770
He says he's gonna be
in his office for another hour.

1196
01:12:43,794 --> 01:12:45,622
What guy? EARL:
The superintendent.

1197
01:12:45,665 --> 01:12:47,687
I told him you was interested
in an apartment so, you know,

1198
01:12:47,711 --> 01:12:49,602
he says he's gonna wait there
and we get over there

1199
01:12:49,626 --> 01:12:51,410
and see him
and we speak about this.

1200
01:12:51,454 --> 01:12:52,977
Hold on one minute.

1201
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:55,196
Hey, Tammy, can I get the car?

1202
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:56,652
I thought you was gonna
meet him tonight.

1203
01:12:56,676 --> 01:12:58,112
I was but he just called
right now.

1204
01:12:58,156 --> 01:12:59,723
I really can't do it.
I work.

1205
01:12:59,766 --> 01:13:02,290
Hey, can you come pick me up?

1206
01:13:02,334 --> 01:13:04,051
Yeah, I can come pick you up.
That's no problem.

1207
01:13:04,075 --> 01:13:05,595
I'll see you in a bit. All right, bye.

1208
01:13:38,196 --> 01:13:39,589
Is it the blue?

1209
01:13:39,632 --> 01:13:41,634
Is it the gold
and the pink dress and the...

1210
01:13:41,678 --> 01:13:43,810
I think the blue
is a little much.

1211
01:13:43,854 --> 01:13:45,290
The blue is too much? Too much.

1212
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:24,242
- Say, what's up with that plan?
- What's your plan?

1213
01:14:24,285 --> 01:14:25,591
