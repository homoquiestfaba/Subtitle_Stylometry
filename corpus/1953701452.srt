Last year, i tried to kill myself.
There was a rumor that went

There was a rumor that went around.

1012
01:03:45,088 --> 01:03:47,489
There was a rumor that went around.
It wasn't true.

1013
01:03:47,491 --> 01:03:50,292
Around. It wasn't true.
Everybody believed it, even my

1014
01:03:50,294 --> 01:03:51,960
it wasn't true. Everybody believed it,
even my friends.

1015
01:03:51,962 --> 01:03:53,428
Everybody believed it, even my friends.
People i trusted most in this

1016
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:55,831
friends. People i trusted most in
this world -- people I've known my

1017
01:03:55,833 --> 01:03:58,466
people i trusted most in this world -- people
I've known my whole life -- thought i was

thought i was capable of such nasty things.

1019
01:04:01,405 --> 01:04:03,104
Whole life -- thought i was capable of such nasty things.
I tried to explain myself, and

1020
01:04:03,106 --> 01:04:04,906
capable of such nasty things. I tried to explain myself,
and they nodded their heads in pity,

1021
01:04:04,908 --> 01:04:07,943
i tried to explain myself, and they nodded
their heads in pity, pretending to believe me.

1022
01:04:07,945 --> 01:04:09,010
They nodded their heads in pity, pretending to
believe me. But they never looked at me the

1023
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:10,946
pretending to believe me.
But they never looked at me the same again.

1024
01:04:10,948 --> 01:04:14,516
But they never looked at me the same again.
And i thought... "Your friends

1025
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:17,586
same again. And i thought...
"Your friends think you're scum.

1026
01:04:17,588 --> 01:04:25,260
And i thought...
"Your friends think you're scum. You must be."

1027
01:04:25,262 --> 01:04:26,461
Think you're scum. You must be."
If my roommate hadn't come

you must be." If my roommate hadn't come home...
I'd have bled out.

1029
01:04:31,902 --> 01:04:32,901
If my roommate hadn't come home...
I'd have bled out. The doctor said i was really

1030
01:04:32,903 --> 01:04:33,935
home... I'd have bled out.
The doctor said i was really gone for a moment.

1031
01:04:33,937 --> 01:04:39,040
The doctor said i was really gone for a moment.
You know, really dead.

1032
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:42,244
Gone for a moment. You know,

You know, really dead.
I don't remember anything. There was nothing.

1034

There was nothing. When i left the hospital,

1035
01:04:46,083 --> 01:04:48,984
there was nothing. When i left the hospital,
i... I'd see these shadows out of

1036
01:04:48,986 --> 01:04:52,020
when i left the hospital,
i... I'd see these shadows out of the corner of my eye.

1037
01:04:52,022 --> 01:04:54,556
I... I'd see these shadows out of the corner of my eye.
They were so familiar.

1038
01:04:54,558 --> 01:04:56,892
The corner of my eye.
They were so familiar. I knew...

1039

They were so familiar. I knew...
I knew there was something

1040
01:04:58,428 --> 01:04:59,961
i knew...
I knew there was something reaching for me, and,

1041
01:04:59,963 --> 01:05:01,062
i knew there was something reaching for
me, and, eventually, it was gonna pull me

1042
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:05,267
reaching for me, and, eventually,
it was gonna pull me right back down.

1043
01:05:05,269 --> 01:05:07,435
Eventually, it was gonna pull me right back down.
I was marked.

1044
01:05:07,437 --> 01:05:08,503
Right back down. I was marked.
Father, i should have been

Father, i should have been scared...
But i felt invincible.
