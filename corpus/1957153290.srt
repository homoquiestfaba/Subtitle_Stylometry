3
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:14,315
WOMAN: Okay.

4
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,417
Well, how long
do you think it's been?

5
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:21,522
MAN: A couple of
weeks maybe, a little bit more.

6
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:24,125
WOMAN: Derrick,
it's been six months.

7
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:25,726
MAN: No, it can't be.

8
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:30,098
Yes, it has been.
Six months. No sex.

9
00:00:30,131 --> 00:00:33,334
Okay, I know
how good your memory is,

10
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,503
but that doesn't sound right.

11
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,505
Then, well, trust me.
It is right.

12
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,173
And we really need to do
something about it.

13
00:00:39,207 --> 00:00:40,208
DERRICK: Like what?

14
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:43,444
Like, take a vacation.

15
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:46,080
You know, we can do
a quick little weekend getaway.

16
00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:49,183
It'd be fun.

17
00:00:49,217 --> 00:00:51,685
Little bubbly, jacuzzi...

18
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,254
We could,
but I don't think I have

19
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:55,089
that kind of time right now,
neither do you.

20
00:00:55,123 --> 00:00:57,491
Well, I don't care.
I'm willing to make the time.

21
00:00:57,525 --> 00:01:00,628
Since when? Every time
I've tried to start something,

22
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:02,463
you're too busy studying.

23
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:05,233
Okay. Well, every time
I've tried to start something,

24
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:06,334
you're always
busy working.

25
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:10,171
And you know what?
We got married.

26
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:11,805
We've promised
ourselves that

27
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:15,143
we would never let it
get boring in the bedroom.

28
00:01:15,176 --> 00:01:17,778
Do you remember that?
I remember.

29
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:20,648
So how is it that we manage
to let six whole months go by

30
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:23,884
and we barely even noticed?

31
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:27,521
Six months and nine days,
actually.

32
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:28,889
You know, I hate
that you're keeping

33
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:32,560
track of how often
we have sex.

34
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,495
Actually it's more like
I'm keeping

35
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:35,863
track of how often
we're not.

36
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,114
Well? What do you think?

37
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:59,220
Hmm, it's okay.

38
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:01,389
Yeah, I thought it'd be
a little bigger though.

39
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:07,628
So no get away.
Not even a weekend?

40
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:09,497
I want to, April.

41
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,899
I just don't see it
happening right now.

42
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:17,205
Great. Saying
"no" to vacation sex.

43
00:02:17,238 --> 00:02:18,339
We're officially old.

44
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:28,582
Hey, guys.

45
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:30,351
Hi, Robin.
Hey.

46
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:31,519
Hey, how are you?

47
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,221
Good. How are you doing?
Good.

48
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:34,622
I really think you guys
are gonna like this one.

49
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:35,656
Come on, let's go see it.

50
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:41,529
So this is it.
Oh.

51
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:43,297
This property
just went on the market.

52
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:45,399
It's three bedrooms,
two and a half baths

53
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:48,302
and it's got a formal
dining room as you can see.

54
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:51,772
And, April, you are not going
to believe the closet space.

55
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:59,713
Oh, no. You hate it.

56
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:04,785
No. I don't hate it.
I really don't.

57
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:09,390
You know, I just
don't think this is the one.

58
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:10,658
Are you sure
you don't wanna

59
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,326
take a quick look
upstairs first?

60
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,994
Yeah, I'm sure.

61
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,364
What do you think?

62
00:03:16,397 --> 00:03:17,798
To be honest,
I kind of like it.

63
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:19,800
But you know,
we both have to be happy.

64
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,602
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:23,437
I know this is like the
millionth house you've shown us.

66
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:24,838
It's okay.

67
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:28,676
We'll see a million more
if we have to.

68
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:29,510
All right.

69
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,678
Right.

70
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,880
Houses like people
they always

71
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:34,915
have some kind
of imperfection.

72
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:37,017
There's no such thing
as the perfect house.

73
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,852
There is
a perfect house for us.

74
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:42,623
It is out there.
All we have to do is find it.

75
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:43,591
( phone ringing )

76
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:45,793
Trouble.

77
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:47,461
Hey.

78
00:03:47,495 --> 00:03:49,463
CHRISTY: What are you
doing right now?

79
00:03:49,497 --> 00:03:51,832
Nothing. Well, I'm in the car,
driving with Derrick.

80
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:53,467
We're going home.

81
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:54,702
Good.
Come and have a drink with us.

82
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:55,736
We're at Rosie's.

83
00:03:57,505 --> 00:03:58,772
Hi, Derrick!

84
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:00,908
Hi, Christy.

85
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:02,876
I can't. I have homework.

86
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,779
CHRISTY: Come on! One drink's
not gonna kill you...

87
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:09,950
Derrick, bring your wife
to me right now.

88
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:10,918
Wow.

89
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,623
One drink, that's it.

90
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:16,857
Oh, yeah, yeah.

91
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,892
So you guys have sex
on the motorcycle.

92
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,027
Yes. Top that.

93
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,795
I'm sorry, April.

94
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:24,332
I've heard this story before,
and I can confirm

95
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:25,399
that is in fact the case.

96
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:26,900
Yes. Thanks sweetie.

97
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,736
Okay, wait, wait.
I don't get it.

98
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,971
Look, how was he able to steer
and have sex

99
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:31,939
with you at the same time?

100
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:33,541
Yeah.

101
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:35,476
Oh, we weren't moving.
We were parked.

102
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:37,345
Parked?
Wait, that doesn't count.

103
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:40,348
Why? It was sex,
and it was on a motorcycle.

104
00:04:40,381 --> 00:04:42,049
If the motorcycle
wasn't moving,

105
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:43,951
then it's not that impressive.

106
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:45,653
Not impressive?

107
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:47,521
Are you kidding me?

108
00:04:47,555 --> 00:04:52,025
Do you know how much balance
and flexibility it takes to--

109
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:54,395
APRIL: A lot
balance and flexibility.

110
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:55,896
Hey, back me up on this.

111
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:57,631
What? No, I'm sorry, honey.

112
00:04:57,665 --> 00:04:59,066
I am gonna have to go
with Derrick on this one.

113
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:00,701
Oh, no you suck.

114
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:02,936
You're not
my best friend anymore.

115
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,105
Huh, I am too
your best friend.

116
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,341
Okay, let's just think
of it this way:

117
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,477
What if I said
that I did it in the car,

118
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,512
but the car was
parked in the garage,

119
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:12,980
how could I call the big deal.

120
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,082
Right, but if the car's
flying down 405 freeway,

121
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:17,084
then you got bragging rights.

122
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:20,821
Give me some.
Aah.

123
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,356
That's not bad idea.

124
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,057
But it's always
jammed really.

125
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:25,993
Hi, guys. I'm sorry,
but your server had to run home

126
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:27,795
to handle an emergency,

127
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,431
so I'll be taking care of you
the rest of the night.

128
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:31,699
I'm Jessica.

129
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:34,101
Hi, Jessica.
You must be new here.

130
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:36,637
Kind of sort of.

131
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,540
I used to worked here
a couple years ago, then I left.

132
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:40,608
And now I'm back.

133
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:42,042
Great.
Welcome back.

134
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,578
Thanks.
So can I get anybody anything?

135
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:48,982
You know-- Actually,
well, we should be going.

136
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,551
Yes,
it's about that time.

137
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:53,454
No, no, no, no, no.
Stay for one more.

138
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:54,722
I can't.

139
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:55,889
Come on,
I got to hit the books.

140
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:57,558
All right.

141
00:05:57,591 --> 00:06:02,663
So, what do you think?
You wanna head out or?

142
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,733
Um, no, I'm cool
sticking around.

143
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:06,767
Yeah, okay.
Okay.

144
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,736
All right.

145
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:09,803
Well, then I guess
we'll talk to you guys later.

146
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:11,472
Okay.
That's for--

147
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:12,673
No, no, no, that's for you.
You cheated.

148
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:16,076
All right.

149
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:18,679
And the first round
is on me, guys.

150
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:19,747
Oh, thanks.

151
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,814
I appreciate that, man.

152
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:22,583
Thank you.

153
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:23,751
I'll hit you later, bro.

154
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:25,519
Bye.
Thanks.

155
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:26,554
That wasn't funny.

156
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,524
So you guys good here.

157
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:31,792
Do you need anything else?

158
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:32,593
Yes. We have--
We need some bread.

159
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:33,661
Bread.

160
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:35,829
Can you top sex
on a motorcycle?

161
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:51,745
What are you doing?

162
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:54,715
I'm trying to distract you.

163
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:55,749
Oh.
Uh-huh.

164
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:57,785
Yeah, I can feel that.

165
00:06:57,818 --> 00:07:00,488
No, no, no, no.
Come on, stop it.

166
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:02,122
I have got a ton of stuff,
I've gotta get into my head

167
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,824
by the end of the week.

168
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:06,126
And you also have
a six-months-and-nine-day

169
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,461
dry spell to break.

170
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:10,864
Okay.

171
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:12,800
Right after I'm done
with this, I promise you.

172
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,502
I'll be in, I'll be in.

173
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:15,536
Would you--

174
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:23,210
All right,
all right, all right.

175
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:25,646
Twenty minutes, okay.

176
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:26,780
You better make them count.

177
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:28,448
That's all I need.

Come here you.

179

Hi.

180
00:07:37,558 --> 00:07:39,126
Give me a big kiss.

181
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:43,564
I'm so happy.

182
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:44,532

No, no, no. Don't, don't even
think about it.

185
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:52,606
But I have to.
It's probably work.

186
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,676

with your wife.

Mm-hmm.

No, Derrick, come on.

191

Come on, seriously,
would you--

00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:04,752
Hello?

193
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,121
Why?
What happened?

194
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:13,661
No, I'm not coming in.
It's my day off.

195
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:17,865
It's not a lot of people.

196
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:19,533
You've cooked for
larger parties than that.

197
00:08:23,571 --> 00:08:24,872
Look, I don't care that
they requested me.

198

I can't just--

199
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:32,546
Okay, fine.

200
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:35,182
I'm on my way.

201
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:48,662
Don't be mad.
I won't be long.

202
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:51,665
You will.
You'll be there all night.

203
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:53,667
But it's no big deal, right?

204

April, I'm doing
this for us.

205
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:57,838
You know, I wouldn't be able
to afford to buy the house

206
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,607
if the restaurant
wasn't doing so well.

207
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:04,678
Oh, okay. So you're buying the
house by yourself now?

208
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:06,213
That what's
happening?

209
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:09,617
You know, it's fine.
Just--

210
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:12,219
Just go.

211
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:19,760
I promise,
I won't be long, okay?

212
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:20,828

Shut up.

and I need coffee.

Come on.

218

Good morning.

219
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:54,895
So the cold
streak continues?

220
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,330
Hmm, unfortunately.

221
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:02,803
I have no idea
what I'm gonna do.

222
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:06,674
I even floated the idea of us
taking a quick vacation,

223

but he shot me down.

Let's talk about
something else.

not talk about me?

remember Jessica?

Why didn't you tell me
you guys had somebody over?

I wouldn't have just invited
myself in the way I did.

You didn't interrupt anything.

poor girl last night.

You and Derrick left
and the three of us

268
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,285
sort of hit it off.

269
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:02,255
Yeah, yeah.
Right.

270
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:05,058

I don't know.

00:12:15,002 --> 00:12:16,303
I know we still
love each other

274
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:20,373
and we're still hot
for each other,

275
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:24,211
just like we're too busy
to enjoy each other.

276
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,478
And it wasn't always
like this I mean,

277
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:28,982
we used to do it
all the time.

278
00:12:29,016 --> 00:12:31,451
But at some point,
I don't know. The sex

279
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,954
just kind of tapered off...

280
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:38,158

it was happening.

Sorry, ladies.
Don't mind me.

283

That was fast.

284
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,334
Jessica forgot her phone.

285
00:12:51,038 --> 00:12:53,240
Leave-behind.
Classic rookie move.

286
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,207
Means she liked us.

287
00:12:56,543 --> 00:12:58,078
Got it.
See you later.

288
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,079
Bye.

289
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,113
Bye.

290
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:07,354
What are you thinking?

291
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:08,388
Nothing.

292
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,161
I just had a crazy thought.

293
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:19,132
Can I ask you
a personal question?

294
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,467
Of course you can.

295
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:26,239
No, like a really
personal question.

296
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,388
You okay?

297
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,256
Remember
when we went to Miami?

298
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:51,298
Yeah.
What about it?

299
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,466
We were on that
red-eye flight,

300
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,236
and at some point you realized
that everybody else

301
00:13:56,269 --> 00:14:01,441
who've fallen asleep,
and so you dared me--

302
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:03,443
No, no, you double dared me

303
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:07,080
to sneak into the bathroom
with you.

304
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:09,216
And so I did.

305
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:11,118
Yeah, that was fun.
Mm-hmm.

306
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:15,522
We never do stuff
like that anymore.

307
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:18,391
What are you saying?

308
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:20,060
You want to have
sex on a plane again?

309
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:25,098
No.

310
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:29,269
Maybe not that, but I think
we should do something.

311
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:32,205
Something different.

312
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:33,240
Different like what?

313
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:39,346
APRIL: Matt and Christy
had a girl over last night.

314
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,514
DERRICK: Matt and Christy
always have a girl over.

315
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:45,118
Sometimes a girl and a guy.

316
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:46,086
APRIL: Yeah, I know.

317
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:49,256
So I had a thought.

318
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:55,095
What if we did
something like that?

319
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:57,664
What are you saying?

320
00:14:57,697 --> 00:14:59,199
You wanna have
an open marriage?

321
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,234
No.

322
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:04,637
I was just thinking we could
try a one-time thing,

323
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:06,273
you know, just to get
our groove back.

324
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:12,379
All right.

325
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,480
DERRICK: What is this?
A test?

326
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:15,182
You're not saying that

327
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:16,716
you'd let me have
sex with Christy.

328
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,385
APRIL: It's not a test.

329
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,387
And trust me, it sound like,
I would love it,

330
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,224
but I don't know
I'd be there, too.

331
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:27,227
And wouldn't be like,
you were going behind my back.

332
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:30,530
Well...

333
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:35,402
I mean--

334
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,070
If you're serious, I--

335
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:43,110
Okay, I--

336
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:44,177
I'm down.

337
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:45,478
APRIL: Yeah?

338
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:46,479
Okay, good.

339
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:51,351
We'll figure out with a good
night for them and set it up.

340
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:52,385
DERRICK: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
"With them?"

341
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:53,286
Great dinner.

342
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,087
APRIL: Yeah.

343
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:55,655
The four of us.

344
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,257
That's what we've talking
about here, Derrick.

345
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,191
That's not
what I'm talking about.

346
00:15:58,225 --> 00:15:59,526
What makes you think

347
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,694
I want to share our bed
with a man?

348
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:03,563
That's not
what I was thinking.

349
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:06,133
Why are you getting
so uncomfortable?

350
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,634
Because I'm comfortable
with three, not four.

351
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,438
So you're fine
with having sex with me

352
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,706
and another woman,
but the minute

353
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,442
I wanna throw
another man in the mix,

354
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,344
that's the deal breaker.

355
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:19,512
DERRICK: Don't ask me
to explain it, but that's--

356
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:21,181
It's different.

357
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:22,515
APRIL: Yeah, you know,
I can explain it.

358
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:23,683
It's called
a double standard.

359
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:28,621
You know, Derrick, we don't
even have to try this.

360
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,490
It was just an idea.

361
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:33,726
But if you think
I'm not gonna call you

362
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,196
out for bullshit,
you're crazy.

363
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,179
Okay, I'll do it.

364
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:56,416
But, I don't want him
touching me.

365
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:58,485
I don't want him
on my side of the bed.

366
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,187
I don't want the lights on.

367
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,688
I don't even want to know
he is in the room.

368
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:03,390
And if that makes me crazy

369
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:04,757
and uptight then
that's just what I'll be.

370
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,394
Okay, you're not crazy
or uptight.

371
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,565
Look, all we have to do
is set the ground rules

372
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,235
and nobody
will have a problem.

373
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:36,683
Mmm.
You smell good.

374
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,655
How long have you been up?

375
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:43,656
Not long.

376
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,593
Are you okay?

377
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,761
Yeah.
Fine.

378
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:49,829
Good.

379
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:18,291
( APRIL MOANING )

380
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,438
Oh, sounds like
they're back in business.

381
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:32,739
Hmm.

382
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,741
Look like our job
here is done.

383
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:41,381
APRIL: Oh, yeah.

384
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:48,521
Oh, God.

385
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:49,856
Oh.

386
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:51,624
Oh, yeah.

387
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:54,761
Yeah.

388
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:57,797
Hey, guys,
we're gonna go now.

389
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,632
APRIL: Bye.

390
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,701
Thanks.

391
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:02,835
Have a good time.

392
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:50,350
What time's your interview?

393
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:53,520
In a couple of hours.
I'm heading out soon.

394
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:55,522
All right.

395
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:56,556
I got to go.

396
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,860
Good luck.

397
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:01,861
Thanks.

398
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:06,499
Hey.

399
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:10,470
So I just want to say,

400
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:12,405
I had fun last night.

401
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,709
Yeah.
Me, too.

402
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:18,345
Yeah.

403
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:23,650
If you want to, you know,
see Derrick again,

404
00:21:23,683 --> 00:21:24,651
just let me know.

405
00:21:24,684 --> 00:21:26,619
I'll clear out.

406
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:30,390
Uh, we're not seeing either
of them again, remember?

407
00:21:30,423 --> 00:21:32,058
Not like last night.
That was just a favor.

408
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:33,993
What do you mean?

409
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:36,663
You know we're not supposed
to mess around with friends.

410
00:21:36,696 --> 00:21:38,865
Friends get weird.
Things get complicated.

411
00:21:42,402 --> 00:21:44,003
Okay.

412
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:45,672
Right.

413
00:21:45,705 --> 00:21:47,674
Jesus.

414
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:49,809
Was she that good?
Should I be worried?

415
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:53,012
She was okay.

416
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:57,584
But she sure
as hell wasn't you.

417
00:21:57,617 --> 00:21:59,051
Uh-huh.
All right.

418
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:00,920
That's more like it.

419
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:01,921
You wanna know
how Derrick was?

420
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:02,955
I'll tell you everything.

421
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:06,426
Not the least bit curious.

422
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:07,694
Hmm, jeez.

423
00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:10,963
I already knew that.
Okay.

424
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:12,832
Call me and let me know
how it goes.

425
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:14,901
Okay. I will.

426
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:16,536
I'll mail these
while I'm out.

427
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:19,506
Ooh, actually, you can't.

428
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:21,408
I'm sorry I thought we had
enough to cover the checks

429
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:22,942
I wrote, but we don't.

430
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:27,480
So they'll have to wait
until we get some money.

431
00:22:28,981 --> 00:22:31,083
I pay it on Friday.

432
00:22:31,117 --> 00:22:32,552
Friday, then.
Okay.

433
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:36,022
God, I hope
you get this job.

434
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,058
Don't worry.

435
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:41,127
I'll make them love me.

436
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,562
I know you will.

437
00:22:56,576 --> 00:22:58,911
Did I tell you how amazing
you were last night?

438
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:01,848
Nope.

439
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:05,552
Well, you were
amazing last night.

440
00:23:05,585 --> 00:23:06,586
Thanks.

441
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:10,790
You're kinda
quiet this morning.

442
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:12,592
You all right?

443
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:13,660
Yep.

444
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,130
Okay.

445
00:23:18,164 --> 00:23:19,899
Hey, you know
what'd be great?

446
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:22,702
If you use two words to answer
me instead of just one.

447
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:27,974
I'm just wondering...

448
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:32,979
why was so important
for you to do this.

449
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,116
What do you mean?
You know why.

450
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:38,551
We talked about it.

451
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:40,520
I know, but--

452
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:44,691
You know what?
Forget it.

453
00:23:44,724 --> 00:23:46,025
Oh, don't do that.

454
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:47,660
You know I hate it
when you do that.

455
00:23:47,694 --> 00:23:50,730
Just tell me
what's on your mind.

456
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:51,798
You let him go down on you.

457
00:23:53,733 --> 00:23:54,967
So?

458
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:56,669
So I thought that was
off-limits.

459
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:00,507
What made you think that?

460
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,709
You never let me do it.

461
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:05,545
Don't "let" you?

462
00:24:05,578 --> 00:24:07,580
Excuse me, but you
choose not to do it.

463
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:10,249
And I choose
not to complain about it.

464
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,719
Yeah.

465
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:15,555
You don't
complain about it.

466
00:24:15,588 --> 00:24:17,524
You just get me

467
00:24:17,557 --> 00:24:18,858
to let somebody else
come in here

468
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:19,859
and do it for you.

469
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:21,260
What?
Hold up.

470
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,195
What are you saying?

471
00:24:23,229 --> 00:24:25,231
Are you saying that
I tricked you into this?

472
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,502
I don't know.
Did you?

473
00:24:47,253 --> 00:24:48,955
All right, you know what?

474
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:52,825
Can we just start this
whole conversation over?

475
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:56,295
We don't have to.
Just forget I said anything.

476
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,897
What was I
supposed to do?

477
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,999
I mean, look--

478
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:01,568
It's not like I planned it.

479
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:02,569
Oh, my God.

480
00:25:02,602 --> 00:25:03,670
He just sort of--

481
00:25:03,703 --> 00:25:05,972
He just went for it
and I just--

482
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,843
Was I supposed
to tell him stop?

483
00:25:10,877 --> 00:25:14,647
Like I said, we don't
need to talk about this.

484
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:16,115
Derrick, why?
How?

485
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:17,617
I wouldn't understand

486
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,251
how you can be
jealous right now.

487
00:25:19,285 --> 00:25:21,921
It is not like
I cheated on you!

488
00:25:21,954 --> 00:25:23,289
You were right there!

489
00:25:23,322 --> 00:25:24,757
Really?

490
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:28,060
Yeah, really.
What? This is crazy.

491
00:25:28,094 --> 00:25:29,261
Mm-hmm.

492
00:25:29,295 --> 00:25:30,797
I thought we were
finally good.

493
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:33,600
We just had sex
in the fucking bathroom!

494
00:25:33,633 --> 00:25:35,935
I didn't initiate that.

495
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:37,804
What?

496
00:25:37,837 --> 00:25:39,205
Like I said, I didn't start
the bathroom thing.

497
00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:40,940
Oh.

498
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:44,711
You came in there
while I'm taking a shower

499
00:25:44,744 --> 00:25:45,812
and jumped all over me.

500
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,949
It is what it is.

501
00:25:49,982 --> 00:25:52,284
Right. Apparently it is.
Okay. I got you.

502
00:25:52,318 --> 00:25:53,953
I got you.

503
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:56,856
All right, so when you have
a problem with me,

504
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,357
you can fuck me, right?

505
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,660
But you can't talk to me.

506
00:26:00,693 --> 00:26:01,794
It's a perk.

507
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:06,666
Well, I'm glad
that I'm still good

508
00:26:06,699 --> 00:26:07,800
for something around here.

509
00:26:07,834 --> 00:26:08,935
Me too.

510
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:36,729
( KNOCKING AT DOOR )

511
00:26:39,966 --> 00:26:41,868
Hey, April.

512
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:43,069
Hi.

513
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,874
I need Christy.

514
00:26:47,907 --> 00:26:49,742
She is not here.
She got called into work.

515
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:53,012
Oh, shit.

516
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:54,681
What's wrong?

517
00:26:56,749 --> 00:26:59,886
It's nothing.
I'm sorry I bothered you.

518
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,694
You guys had a fight,
didn't you?

519
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:10,997
About last night?

520
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:14,867
How'd you know?

521
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:22,174
That look on your face?
I've seen it before.

522
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:26,979
You wanna--

523
00:27:27,013 --> 00:27:28,180
You wanna talk about it?

524
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:33,820
Only if you're not busy,

525
00:27:33,853 --> 00:27:36,889
because I really need to get
out of here for a little while.

526
00:27:38,858 --> 00:27:40,092
My day's wide open.

527
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:51,270
So what happened?

528
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:57,176
He got mad because--

529
00:28:00,947 --> 00:28:01,948
Because?

530
00:28:01,981 --> 00:28:04,250
What?

531
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:05,952
What's so funny?

532
00:28:05,985 --> 00:28:09,088
Oh, it's nothing.
You know, I'm sorry.

533
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:12,158
I don't think I could
talk to you about this.

534
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:15,494
I thought I could, but now
that I'm actually sitting here.

535
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,496
I don't think I can.

536
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,432
Well, okay.

537
00:28:20,466 --> 00:28:22,034
If you don't
wanna talk about it,

538
00:28:22,068 --> 00:28:23,069
we don't have
to talk about it.

539
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:29,008
But you shouldn't
feel awkward with me.

540
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:33,980
I mean, I know, I know,
but we're still friends.

541
00:28:34,013 --> 00:28:37,483
Yeah, we're friends
that slept together.

542
00:28:42,088 --> 00:28:43,055
And we're married.

543
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:45,792
I know. I know.

544
00:28:45,825 --> 00:28:48,027
Oh, God.
This is so strange.

545
00:28:50,162 --> 00:28:51,263
And I thought
this was supposed to be

546
00:28:51,297 --> 00:28:53,900
every man's fantasy, right?

547
00:28:53,933 --> 00:28:55,134
I mean, come on.

548
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:56,135
And now
he's trying to act like

549
00:28:56,168 --> 00:28:57,269
he is some sort of victim.

550
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:03,910
Is that why you did it?
Just-- just for him?

551
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:07,914
No, I did it for me, too.

552
00:29:07,947 --> 00:29:09,548
Yeah?
I did.

553
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,516
Yeah.

554
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:15,855
Yeah, I did that.

555
00:29:15,888 --> 00:29:17,089
I don't know,
I thought it would just

556
00:29:17,123 --> 00:29:19,892
kind of bring
the magic back...

557
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:24,230
but instead it's just
blowing up in my face.

558
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:33,005
So how do you
and Christy do it?

559
00:29:35,141 --> 00:29:36,575
Do what?

560
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,946
Well, I get behind her,
she does her taxes and I--

561
00:29:39,979 --> 00:29:43,082
And I could take her
and then she is like, "1099!"

562
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:45,417
She finishes-- yeah.
We always do taxes.

563
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:46,585
That's amazing.
I know.

564
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,553
It's good and efficient.

565
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:55,161
Oh, they've got
a good lotion here.

566
00:29:58,064 --> 00:29:59,165
Okay.

567
00:29:59,198 --> 00:30:03,169
So, I think I figured out

568
00:30:03,202 --> 00:30:05,972
what started your fight
with Derrick.

569
00:30:06,005 --> 00:30:07,874
Hmm.
Mm-hmm.

570
00:30:07,907 --> 00:30:10,176
Is that what you've been
thinking about all this time?

571
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:12,144
Yeah.

572
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:19,051
So we're gonna do this.
All right, fine, yeah.

573
00:30:19,085 --> 00:30:20,086
Tell me your little theory.

574
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:26,292
I think...

575
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:31,163
that when you
and Derrick have sex...

576
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:36,102
you don't always,
you know, finish

577
00:30:36,135 --> 00:30:37,369
or he finishes before you.

578
00:30:37,403 --> 00:30:41,874
But, you know,
hey, with me...

579
00:30:45,111 --> 00:30:49,381
you made it all the way there,
and I think--

580
00:30:49,415 --> 00:30:51,617
I think he found
that kind of threatening.

581
00:30:57,123 --> 00:30:58,925
Nice try.

582
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:01,127
You're not even close.

583
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,929
Come on.
You can be honest with me.

584
00:31:02,962 --> 00:31:05,664
Well, I am being honest.

585
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:10,269
Trust me, Derrick
is good in that department.

586
00:31:10,302 --> 00:31:11,537
How good?

587
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:14,640
Better than me?

588
00:31:18,677 --> 00:31:20,346
Matt, what are you doing?

589
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:23,282
Oh, I'm asking
you a question.

590
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:25,985
No, you're flirting with me.

591
00:31:28,287 --> 00:31:29,588
Yeah.

592
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:32,524
I like flirting with you.

593
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,162
Stop it.

594
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:37,163
I mean it.

595
00:31:38,998 --> 00:31:39,999
Okay.

596
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:45,271
Okay.
I'm sorry.

597
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:52,044
Look, I'm trying
to fix something here,

598
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:55,047
not make it worse,
you know.

599
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:56,715
Yeah.

600
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,985
And if you can't help me,
or just listen to me vent,

601
00:31:59,018 --> 00:32:00,219
well then, you know,

602
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:01,253
we should just
probably just go.

603
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:02,721
April, wait.

604
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:03,922
Okay.

605
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:07,259
You're right.
You are.

606
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:14,333
I just thought that
you and I had...

607
00:32:18,037 --> 00:32:21,740
a really strong connection
last night.

608
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,110
A lot stronger than I thought
it was gonna be.

609
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:34,353
But if I misread
the situation, okay.

610
00:32:34,386 --> 00:32:36,388
You know, just say the word,
I'll back off.

611
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:41,994
We had sex.

612
00:32:42,028 --> 00:32:43,229
We didn't "connect."

613
00:32:48,134 --> 00:32:51,103
You know, I'm not
one of these girls that you

614
00:32:51,137 --> 00:32:55,407
and Christy take home and--

615
00:32:55,441 --> 00:32:56,442
Oh, come on.
Yeah.

616
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:57,609
Okay.
You know what?

617
00:33:00,146 --> 00:33:01,113
Whatever.

618
00:33:01,147 --> 00:33:02,248
That's-- yeah.

619
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:04,950
This was stupid.

620
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,289
I should just go.

621
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:11,257
Okay?
Yeah.

622
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,214
Thanks for picking up
the check.

623
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:41,687
And don't worry,
I'll pay you back.

624
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:47,393
Money's just, you know,

625
00:33:47,426 --> 00:33:48,694
it's been
a little tight lately.

626
00:33:52,098 --> 00:33:53,232
( PHONE RINGING )

627
00:34:00,106 --> 00:34:01,140
Hi, Robin.

628
00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:04,310
Oh, wow.

629
00:34:06,312 --> 00:34:07,746
Yeah.
I'd like to.

630
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:10,149
I just--I don't know
if we can make it.

631
00:34:12,351 --> 00:34:14,753
Yeah, but see Derrick
is probably, you know,

632
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:16,388
he is at work now and--

633
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:25,831
Yeah, actually, yes.

634
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:27,333
We'll make it.
I'll get him there.

635
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:31,537
So what time are
you thinking?

636
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,106
Oh, okay, cool.
Yeah.

637
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,474
Let me give you
a call back.

638
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:37,276
Okay bye.

639
00:34:56,362 --> 00:34:57,563
Hey, Derrick.

640
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:58,764
Your wife's here.

641
00:35:03,502 --> 00:35:05,571
You want me to tell her
you're busy?

642
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:07,573
No, I got it, Kevin.
Thanks.

643
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:08,807
This is ready to go.

644
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,875
Okay.

645
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,157
Hey.

646
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:30,529
Do you get a break soon?

647
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:34,333
I have an hour coming up.
Why?

648
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:39,405
Robin called.

649
00:35:39,438 --> 00:35:41,907
She wants us
to look at another place.

650
00:35:48,247 --> 00:35:49,415
Okay.

651
00:35:49,448 --> 00:35:50,649
Can you hang out for a few?

652
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,922
I'll be here.

653
00:35:56,955 --> 00:35:58,190
All right.

654
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,695
ROBIN:
Now I'll be honest.

655
00:36:03,729 --> 00:36:05,564
This one is at the upper end
of your price range,

656
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:07,299
but I still wanted
you to see it.

657
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:08,934
It has a fantastic
gourmet kitchen,

658
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:10,536
all the cabinets
are brand-new,

659
00:36:10,569 --> 00:36:12,638
and the master bedroom
suite opens up

660
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:14,506
onto a beautiful
covered patio.

661
00:36:16,275 --> 00:36:17,309
Are they flexible
on the price?

662
00:36:17,343 --> 00:36:19,245
Well, I know
the other agent.

663
00:36:19,278 --> 00:36:21,380
So there's definitely
wiggle room.

664
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:23,715
It's nice,
don't you think?

665
00:36:23,749 --> 00:36:25,484
Yeah.

666
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:28,720
Big backyard.
We could put in a pool.

667
00:36:28,754 --> 00:36:30,222
Yeah.

668
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:34,326
And there's only three
registered sex offenders

669
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,394
in this neighborhood.

670
00:36:37,363 --> 00:36:39,665
Yeah.

671
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:42,734
Yeah.

672
00:36:42,768 --> 00:36:46,272
I think we're gonna
pass on this one.

673
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:48,707
Yeah, I'm getting
that feeling, too.

674
00:36:58,016 --> 00:36:59,451
What?

675
00:36:59,485 --> 00:37:01,453
"Registered sex offender?"

676
00:37:01,487 --> 00:37:04,590
I was teasing you.

677
00:37:04,623 --> 00:37:06,292
It didn't seem like you
were paying too much

678
00:37:06,325 --> 00:37:07,759
attention back there.

679
00:37:07,793 --> 00:37:10,362
I was paying attention.

680
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:12,498
I just don't think
that that's our house.

681
00:37:12,531 --> 00:37:14,633
What was wrong with it?
Is it too big?

682
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:15,767
Is it too small?

683
00:37:15,801 --> 00:37:17,303
Not enough bedrooms?
What?

684
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:18,670
I don't know.

685
00:37:18,704 --> 00:37:20,506
I can't put
my finger on it.

686
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:23,309
I just know that the moment
we walked into the house

687
00:37:23,342 --> 00:37:26,378
that's meant for us,
I'll know.

688
00:37:26,412 --> 00:37:28,614
We both will.

689
00:37:28,647 --> 00:37:30,616
I guess we'll keep
looking, then.

690
00:37:36,722 --> 00:37:38,724
Okay, you know that
I'm so mad at you, right?

691
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,492
I know.

692
00:37:40,526 --> 00:37:42,794
And I apologize
I should have never said

693
00:37:42,828 --> 00:37:44,396
those things to you.

694
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:47,666
I just got freaked out
last night.

695
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:52,404
I thought I would be able
handle what happened.

696
00:37:52,438 --> 00:37:54,706
And but seeing it for myself I--

697
00:37:56,608 --> 00:38:00,011
Whatever.
It was my fault, not yours.

698
00:38:02,714 --> 00:38:04,282
And I just need
to get past it.

699
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,759
All right, you don't
ever get to talk to me

700
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,661
the way you did.

701
00:38:15,694 --> 00:38:16,828
Ever again.

702
00:38:16,862 --> 00:38:18,730
I won't.
I won't.

703
00:38:18,764 --> 00:38:20,065
I promise.

704
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:42,621
CHRISTY: Babe!

705
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:45,090
Hey.

706
00:38:45,123 --> 00:38:47,759
You will never guess
what happened.

707
00:38:47,793 --> 00:38:49,628
What?

708
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,797
They offered me a full-time
teaching position.

709
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,131
Starting Monday.

710
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,766
Are you serious?
Yeah.

711
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,802
I mean, there is
a little bit of paperwork,

712
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:58,704
but as of next week I--

713
00:38:58,737 --> 00:39:00,472
I'm officially
part of the faculty

714
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:01,640
and not just a substitute.

715
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:05,411
That's amazing.
My God.

716
00:39:05,444 --> 00:39:06,645
Congratulations.

717
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:08,614
Thank you.

718
00:39:08,647 --> 00:39:11,817
Thank you.
Wow. Good work.

719
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:16,422
So how did your thing go?

720
00:39:16,455 --> 00:39:18,123
What thing?

721
00:39:18,156 --> 00:39:19,791
Your interview, silly.

722
00:39:19,825 --> 00:39:21,893
I was expecting a call
or a text or something.

723
00:39:21,927 --> 00:39:24,162
Oh, that.
Yeah.

724
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,898
They called and pushed it
back to tomorrow.

725
00:39:26,932 --> 00:39:28,900
Oh. I'm sorry.

726
00:39:28,934 --> 00:39:30,902
Well, that just means
you have another day

727
00:39:30,936 --> 00:39:32,738
to prepare, right?

728
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:35,574
That's right.

729
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:37,809
So what have you been
doing all day?

730
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:40,746
Nothing.

731
00:39:42,614 --> 00:39:44,783
Just hanging out.

732
00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:46,485
You haven't even
left the house?

733
00:39:50,556 --> 00:39:51,590
Nope.

734
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:57,195
Okay.
Come on.

735
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,797
You're getting dressed.

736
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:00,932
What for?

737
00:40:00,966 --> 00:40:02,501
We're gonna go celebrate.

738
00:40:07,573 --> 00:40:10,542
Well, to my girl Christy,
the best teacher ever.

739
00:40:10,576 --> 00:40:13,211
Yes, I don't know
about all that.

740
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:16,482
I just hope I don't warp
their little brains too badly.

741
00:40:16,515 --> 00:40:17,516
Yeah.
Me too.

742
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,488
Okay.
Where is Derrick?

743
00:40:22,521 --> 00:40:23,822
He said he'd come right back
and hang out.

744
00:40:23,855 --> 00:40:25,824
Well, you know,
it's the top of a shift.

745
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:28,827
So he's got a slice and dice
and make it all fabulous.

746
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,496
But I wanted us
to have a little--

747
00:40:30,529 --> 00:40:32,564
Oh, oh.

748
00:40:32,598 --> 00:40:34,566
Wow!

749
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,967
I think you're really
happy about--

750
00:40:36,001 --> 00:40:37,636
Yes, I am.
All right, okay.

751
00:40:37,669 --> 00:40:39,571
I have to now go
take my clothes off.

752
00:40:39,605 --> 00:40:40,639
Oh, wow.
All right.

753
00:40:44,009 --> 00:40:45,544
Do you--
Okay.

754
00:40:53,885 --> 00:40:56,722
You're not still
mad at me, are you?

755
00:40:56,755 --> 00:40:58,824
You know, that depends.

756
00:40:58,857 --> 00:40:59,858
Are you gonna
hit on me again?

757
00:41:03,028 --> 00:41:04,229
No.

758
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,534
But for the record,

759
00:41:08,567 --> 00:41:11,737
I do think
you kind of overreacted.

760
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:16,007
Well, you know
for the record,

761
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:18,243
you did kind of go way
over the line.

762
00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:23,014
Okay.

763
00:41:23,048 --> 00:41:26,017
I guess we'll just
agree to disagree, then.

764
00:41:26,051 --> 00:41:27,886
You know, I actually
have a better idea.

765
00:41:27,919 --> 00:41:30,689
How about we agree
that you are wrong?

766
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:38,964
Okay.
Fine.

767
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,699
I was wrong.

768
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,875
Dinner's on us,
by the way.

769
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:53,579
You don't have to do that.

770
00:41:53,612 --> 00:41:56,548
And Derrick hates
it when his friends pay.

771
00:41:56,582 --> 00:42:00,619
Yeah, but that was
before I slept with his wife.

772
00:42:02,921 --> 00:42:04,823
Why don't you say
that a little louder?

773
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:06,324
I don't think everybody
heard you.

774
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,259
I'm sorry.
Was I over the line again?

775
00:42:15,967 --> 00:42:16,968
APRIL: Wait.

776
00:42:17,002 --> 00:42:19,070
Hold on.

777
00:42:19,104 --> 00:42:20,606
Try to the right.

778
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:23,074
No, no, no, my right.

779
00:42:23,108 --> 00:42:24,576
Could you just--

780
00:42:27,813 --> 00:42:28,914
Okay.

781
00:42:30,982 --> 00:42:32,818
All right, let's just stop.

782
00:42:34,986 --> 00:42:37,689
What's wrong?

783
00:42:37,723 --> 00:42:39,557
Nothing, I just--

784
00:42:40,992 --> 00:42:41,993
Come up here.

785
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:48,366
You okay?

786
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:51,670
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just wanted you next to me.

787
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:55,707
Oh, I get it.

788
00:42:55,741 --> 00:42:57,108
You're trying to tell me

789
00:42:57,142 --> 00:42:58,276
I don't know
what I'm not doing.

790
00:42:58,309 --> 00:42:59,878
No.
I didn't say that.

791
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:00,946
You didn't have to.

792
00:43:03,882 --> 00:43:04,850
What are you doing?

793
00:43:07,853 --> 00:43:11,990
Okay, let's try it again.

794
00:43:12,023 --> 00:43:13,725
What for?

795
00:43:13,759 --> 00:43:15,827
I obviously don't know
what I'm doing.

796
00:43:15,861 --> 00:43:16,928
Not like Matt.

797
00:44:11,049 --> 00:44:12,083
Will you talk to me, please?

798
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,855
Okay.

799
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:30,201
You all set?

800
00:44:30,235 --> 00:44:32,871
Yeah...

801
00:44:32,904 --> 00:44:33,905
I think so.

802
00:44:36,775 --> 00:44:38,877
Hey, how come they pushed
your job interview

803
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:41,179
from yesterday to today?

804
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:47,986
Oh.

805
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:50,221
The guy had a conflict.

806
00:44:50,255 --> 00:44:52,457
I think it was a family
emergency or something.

807
00:44:53,825 --> 00:44:55,460
Oh.

808
00:44:55,493 --> 00:44:58,997
So they called and asked you
to come in today instead.

809
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:01,833
Yeah.

810
00:45:01,867 --> 00:45:03,802
They called you.

811
00:45:07,138 --> 00:45:08,439
Christy, yes.

812
00:45:10,141 --> 00:45:11,142
Why do you ask?

813
00:45:13,812 --> 00:45:14,913
No reason.

814
00:45:20,886 --> 00:45:23,822
They called again when you
were in the shower.

815
00:45:29,995 --> 00:45:31,729
You're confirmed
for this afternoon.

816
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:35,266
Okay.
Good.

817
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,835
Thanks.

818
00:45:41,306 --> 00:45:43,174
Good luck.

819
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:44,509
Thank you.

820
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:57,889
APRIL: And then
he just walked out.

821
00:45:57,923 --> 00:46:00,525
And I tried to get him
to talk to me,

822
00:46:00,558 --> 00:46:03,128
but he just left
without saying anything.

823
00:46:05,931 --> 00:46:09,300
And he knows how much
I hate it when he does that.

824
00:46:09,334 --> 00:46:10,902
You know, I think
he did on purpose.

825
00:46:14,973 --> 00:46:16,942
And you're not even
listening to me.

826
00:46:16,975 --> 00:46:19,911
So--

827
00:46:19,945 --> 00:46:21,146
Hey.

828
00:46:21,179 --> 00:46:23,248
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

829
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:25,083
What?

830
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:26,151
I am, I am.

831
00:46:26,184 --> 00:46:27,552
No, you're not.

832
00:46:29,187 --> 00:46:32,323
You're off on another
planet somewhere.

833
00:46:32,357 --> 00:46:34,926
All right, fess up?
What's going on with you?

834
00:46:37,963 --> 00:46:39,230
Something's going
on with Matt.

835
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:43,001
He had this big job
interview yesterday,

836
00:46:43,034 --> 00:46:45,871
one he was really
excited about.

837
00:46:45,904 --> 00:46:47,338
But I think he ended up
blowing it off.

838
00:46:49,407 --> 00:46:52,978
Well, what makes you
think that?

839
00:46:53,011 --> 00:46:56,114
Because the company
called this morning.

840
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:59,184
He was in the shower,
so I answered his phone.

841
00:46:59,217 --> 00:47:01,619
They wanted to confirm that
he was coming in today,

842
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:05,123
since he called them yesterday
and asked them to push it back.

843
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:08,193
Except he'd already lied to me
and said they pushed it back.

844
00:47:11,096 --> 00:47:12,898
So he had plans yesterday?

845
00:47:12,931 --> 00:47:14,399
Yeah.

846
00:47:14,432 --> 00:47:18,003
But apparently he ended up
doing something else.

847
00:47:18,036 --> 00:47:19,270
I just don't know what.

848
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:23,141
Christy--

849
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:25,276
Oh, my God.

850
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:26,878
I'm so stupid.

851
00:47:28,914 --> 00:47:30,048
I bet it was Jessica.

852
00:47:31,917 --> 00:47:33,151
Who?

853
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:35,120
Jessica, that god dammed
waitress.

854
00:47:37,956 --> 00:47:38,890
Well...

855
00:47:40,225 --> 00:47:43,028
that's just perfect.

856
00:47:43,061 --> 00:47:44,662
We're barely able
to pay our bills

857
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,664
and he's skipping job
interviews,

858
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:48,266
so he can chase
some girl behind my back.

859
00:47:48,299 --> 00:47:50,401
I'm gonna kill him.

860
00:47:56,975 --> 00:47:59,677
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

861
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:03,181
I didn't mean to dump
all that on you.

862
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:04,149
No, it's okay.

863
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:20,031
Hey.

864
00:48:20,065 --> 00:48:21,032
Hey.

865
00:48:24,335 --> 00:48:26,938
Oh. Hang on a second.

866
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,943
I, uh--
I wanted to give you this.

867
00:48:31,977 --> 00:48:32,978
What's that for?

868
00:48:33,011 --> 00:48:34,445
Dinner last night.

869
00:48:34,479 --> 00:48:36,014
I know you prefer to treat,
but --

870
00:48:37,148 --> 00:48:38,316
Here. Just take it.

871
00:48:38,349 --> 00:48:40,085
Don't worry about it.

872
00:48:40,118 --> 00:48:42,220
I'm not worried about it.

873
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:44,055
I'd just rather pay
my own way.

874
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:47,058
Since when?

875
00:48:47,092 --> 00:48:48,493
You guys have been
eating at my restaurant

876
00:48:48,526 --> 00:48:51,162
ever since I started
working there,

877
00:48:51,196 --> 00:48:52,363
and I've never seen
you all stressed out

878
00:48:52,397 --> 00:48:54,399
about picking up
a bill before.

879
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:56,067
Nobody's stressed out.

880
00:48:56,101 --> 00:49:00,738
I just don't need your charity,
Derrick.

881
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:03,708
Last time I heard,
you still didn't have a job.

882
00:49:03,741 --> 00:49:07,578
So the way I see it,
you do need my charity.

883
00:49:07,612 --> 00:49:09,247
All right.

884
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,416
You're right.
I guees you're right.

885
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:13,985
I did need your help.

886
00:49:14,019 --> 00:49:14,986
Like you needed mine.

887
00:49:17,388 --> 00:49:19,524
What's that supposed to mean?

888
00:49:19,557 --> 00:49:21,426
Well...

889
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:26,197
somebody had to teach you
how to satisfy April.

890
00:49:26,231 --> 00:49:28,266
Come to think of it,

891
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:29,767
you never did
thank me for that.

892
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,269
So maybe we'll just
call it even, and--

893
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:32,403
Shut the fuck up.

894
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:36,341
She told me you were jealous.

895
00:49:36,374 --> 00:49:38,376
She fucking told me.
And I don't blame you.

896
00:49:38,409 --> 00:49:40,411
It was probably the best fucking
sex she's had in a long--

897
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:44,115
Hmm? Keep talking.

898
00:49:44,149 --> 00:49:45,350
Do you regret it, Derrick?

899
00:49:45,383 --> 00:49:47,018
Letting another man
fuck your wife?

900
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:07,072
God, this is so frustrating.

901
00:50:07,105 --> 00:50:08,506
But all he keeps saying is

902
00:50:08,539 --> 00:50:10,541
he doesn't
wanna talk about it.

903
00:50:10,575 --> 00:50:14,045
Yeah, you know, I got home
right after it happened.

904
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:15,813
Look, from what I heard,

905
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,382
it sounds
they were both being idiots,

906
00:50:17,415 --> 00:50:20,418
and things got
a little out of control.

907
00:50:21,619 --> 00:50:24,589
All right.
So what do we do?

908
00:50:24,622 --> 00:50:26,591
We get them sit down
together and iron it out?

909
00:50:26,624 --> 00:50:28,593
Because if that doesn't work,

910
00:50:28,626 --> 00:50:30,561
I'm willing to knock some sense
into both of them.

911
00:50:30,595 --> 00:50:35,100
Okay easy. I don't think
we need to go that far.

912
00:50:37,302 --> 00:50:39,470
You know, I just hate
that all this craziness

913
00:50:39,504 --> 00:50:41,206
made Matt miss
his interview again.

914
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:44,309
He didn't go?

915
00:50:48,113 --> 00:50:49,380
Didn't he tell you?

916
00:50:49,414 --> 00:50:51,482
He hasn't told me
anything--

917
00:50:51,516 --> 00:50:52,817
God. I just assumed--

918
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:54,085
All right, I got to go.

919
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:55,153
You know, Christy wait just--

920
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,694
Oh, shit.

921
00:51:10,601 --> 00:51:12,370
You know, you could've
at least told me

922
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:14,339
you missed your interview.

923
00:51:16,274 --> 00:51:17,608
I don't know if you noticed,

924
00:51:17,642 --> 00:51:20,245
but I kind of got my ass
kicked today.

925
00:51:20,278 --> 00:51:22,079
I can't exactly go in there
spitting up blood.

926
00:51:26,284 --> 00:51:27,485
Did they let you
reschedule.

927
00:51:30,255 --> 00:51:33,124
Oh, man.

928
00:51:33,158 --> 00:51:35,293
I didn't even call them back.
I forgot.

929
00:51:35,326 --> 00:51:38,629
Matt, what is
going on with you?

930
00:51:38,663 --> 00:51:40,298
Do you even want this job?

931
00:51:40,331 --> 00:51:42,467
Of course I do.

932
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,435
Then maybe
you can explain to me

933
00:51:44,469 --> 00:51:45,603
why these things
keep happening.

934
00:51:45,636 --> 00:51:49,874
What things are you
talking about?

935
00:51:49,907 --> 00:51:53,144
You lied to me
about why you didn't go

936
00:51:53,178 --> 00:51:54,645
to the interview.

937
00:51:54,679 --> 00:51:57,648
And today, you just
happen to get into a fight

938
00:51:57,682 --> 00:51:58,883
when you're on the way
to interview--

939
00:51:58,916 --> 00:52:01,552
Wait a minute.
I never lied to you.

940
00:52:01,586 --> 00:52:04,155
Yes, you did.

941
00:52:04,189 --> 00:52:05,690
I talked to them
when you were in the shower.

942
00:52:05,723 --> 00:52:07,892
They told me you canceled
on them,

943
00:52:07,925 --> 00:52:10,561
but that's isn't
what you told me.

944
00:52:10,595 --> 00:52:14,299
Okay, so I got
the details mixed up.

945
00:52:14,332 --> 00:52:16,234
What difference does it make?

946
00:52:16,267 --> 00:52:19,136
The difference is that,
I'm not a fool.

947
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:23,241
Matt.

948
00:52:25,343 --> 00:52:26,411
I know what
you've been up to.

949
00:52:34,285 --> 00:52:34,952
Christy--

950
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:35,786
Don't.

951
00:52:39,324 --> 00:52:40,925
If you want to keep
seeing Jessica,

952
00:52:40,958 --> 00:52:43,461
then just be honest about it.

953
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:44,962
You don't have to sneak around,

954
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,432
worrying about keeping
your story straight.

955
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,402
Matt.

956
00:52:51,436 --> 00:52:54,905
I get it.
I do.

957
00:52:54,939 --> 00:52:56,407
Jessica's hot.

958
00:52:56,441 --> 00:52:57,942
And she was fun
to fool around with.

959
00:52:57,975 --> 00:52:58,943
And--

960
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:05,750
But you can't let her interfere
with you finding a job,

961
00:53:05,783 --> 00:53:07,885
because we're really hanging
by a thread here.

962
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:10,788
I know we are.

963
00:53:10,821 --> 00:53:15,493
But I haven't seen Jessica
since we saw Jessica.

964
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:17,328
I haven't even talked to her.

965
00:53:17,362 --> 00:53:21,666
So you can stop worrying
about that.

966
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:23,334
Are you sure?

967
00:53:23,368 --> 00:53:25,436
Because this has been
driving me crazy.

968
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:27,004
I'm positive.

969
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:29,407
You're worrying yourself
sick over nothing.

970
00:53:34,712 --> 00:53:36,247
Maybe I am.

971
00:53:36,281 --> 00:53:37,482
I have been
stressing a lot lately.

972
00:53:40,385 --> 00:53:42,353
And it doesn't help
that Derrick and April

973
00:53:42,387 --> 00:53:45,256
buying a house and starting
this great new life together

974
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:47,625
and we're sitting here
stuck in the mud.

975
00:53:47,658 --> 00:53:51,896
I know.
But it'll be our turn soon.

976
00:53:56,967 --> 00:53:58,002
It better be.

977
00:54:13,618 --> 00:54:15,486
I tried calling you.
A few times.

978
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:18,255
I know.

979
00:54:21,326 --> 00:54:24,329
Look, I know I went a little
overboard earlier, but--

980
00:54:24,362 --> 00:54:26,897
Don't apologize to me.
Matt's downstairs.

981
00:54:28,733 --> 00:54:30,701
I'm not talking about Matt.

982
00:54:30,735 --> 00:54:33,671
I don't care about Matt.
I'm talking about you and I.

983
00:54:35,573 --> 00:54:38,075
Us trying to be
like them was stupid.

984
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:40,077
We should never tried
to be like Matt and Christy.

985
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,679
We're not them,
and we never will be.

986
00:54:41,712 --> 00:54:43,948
I wasn't trying
to be like anybody.

987
00:54:46,651 --> 00:54:48,619
I was just trying
to get closer to you.

988
00:54:48,653 --> 00:54:49,720
You--

989
00:54:49,754 --> 00:54:51,356
You don't regret it?

990
00:54:51,389 --> 00:54:52,423
Why should I?

991
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:57,462
April, you slept
with another man.

992
00:54:57,495 --> 00:54:59,430
And where were you
when that happening?

993
00:54:59,464 --> 00:55:00,731
Oh, yeah.

994
00:55:00,765 --> 00:55:01,999
You were right there
next to me,

995
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:02,733
having sex
with another woman.

996
00:55:02,767 --> 00:55:04,402
Yeah.

997
00:55:04,435 --> 00:55:05,970
And I'm ashamed of it.

998
00:55:06,003 --> 00:55:07,972
You shouldn't be, Derrick.

999
00:55:08,005 --> 00:55:10,775
You shouldn't be
ashamed of anything
that we did that night.

1000
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:13,110
There is anything
you should be ashamed about is

1001
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,579
the way you been
acting ever since.

1002
00:55:22,787 --> 00:55:25,390
( knocking on door )

1003
00:55:30,027 --> 00:55:32,029
Hi.

1004
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:35,600
Hey, April.

1005
00:55:35,633 --> 00:55:39,470
I came by to say
I'm sorry for outing you.

1006
00:55:40,705 --> 00:55:42,039
You "outed" me?

1007
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:43,441
Last night.

1008
00:55:43,474 --> 00:55:45,410
On the phone
with Christy

1009
00:55:45,443 --> 00:55:49,980
I said something about you not
making it to your interview,

1010
00:55:50,014 --> 00:55:54,018
I-- I had no idea that
she didn't already know.

1011
00:55:54,051 --> 00:55:56,153
Don't worry about that.

1012
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:58,122
We worked it all out.

1013
00:55:58,155 --> 00:55:59,724
Yeah?
Yeah.

1014
00:55:59,757 --> 00:56:03,994
Are you sure?
I'm positive.

1015
00:56:08,433 --> 00:56:12,036
So, how you're
feeling today, champ?

1016
00:56:12,069 --> 00:56:15,039
Don't you start.

1017
00:56:15,072 --> 00:56:16,641
I embarrass easily.

1018
00:56:16,674 --> 00:56:17,608
I know.

1019
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:22,713
I'm...I'm fine.

1020
00:56:22,747 --> 00:56:24,982
Thanks.

1021
00:56:25,015 --> 00:56:26,584
Good.

1022
00:56:26,617 --> 00:56:30,555
I--I could use
some air, though.

1023
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:37,862
So you are saying
you're not a perfectionist.

1024
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:39,163
Oh, wow.

1025
00:56:39,196 --> 00:56:40,898
So you're just
taking his side.

1026
00:56:40,931 --> 00:56:42,500
It's out.
No, no, no, that's okay.

1027
00:56:42,533 --> 00:56:44,201
I know your bromance,
so it's all good.

1028
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,169
Great.

1029
00:56:52,209 --> 00:56:54,779
So I have a question.

1030
00:56:54,812 --> 00:56:55,746
Okay.

1031
00:57:00,585 --> 00:57:03,554
Why didn't
you just call me?

1032
00:57:03,588 --> 00:57:04,789
I mean this morning.

1033
00:57:04,822 --> 00:57:06,557
Something as simple
as a quick apology,

1034
00:57:06,591 --> 00:57:09,059
normally you'd just
pick up the phone for that.

1035
00:57:11,228 --> 00:57:13,063
I don't know.

1036
00:57:13,097 --> 00:57:16,801
I guess I just wanted
to make sure that you're okay.

1037
00:57:16,834 --> 00:57:18,803
It happens just, you know,
men have a tendency

1038
00:57:18,836 --> 00:57:21,972
to want to pretend
that they are not hurt.

1039
00:57:22,006 --> 00:57:23,474
Well, I knew that
you couldn't do it

1040
00:57:23,508 --> 00:57:26,777
if I was--
if I was looking at you.

1041
00:57:26,811 --> 00:57:28,779
Yeah.

1042
00:57:28,813 --> 00:57:34,184
So, see, you were
worried about me?

1043
00:57:34,218 --> 00:57:35,753
Yeah.

1044
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:36,821
Si. Okay.

1045
00:57:40,825 --> 00:57:42,860
I'm about to hit you.

1046
00:57:42,893 --> 00:57:44,962
No, no, the whole family.

1047
00:57:46,531 --> 00:57:47,965
All right, yes.

1048
00:57:47,998 --> 00:57:50,901
I admit it, I was
little bit worried.

1049
00:58:01,779 --> 00:58:05,115
The other day you said
that you weren't busy.

1050
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:08,553
That wasn't true.

1051
00:58:17,762 --> 00:58:20,765
No.
No, it wasn't.

1052
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:21,999
I had an interview

1053
00:58:22,032 --> 00:58:25,202
but I moved it
at the last minute.

1054
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:32,643
Matt, you haven't worked
in like eight months.

1055
00:58:32,677 --> 00:58:35,746
And then this
big opportunity comes by

1056
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:38,916
and you just blew it off.

1057
00:58:38,949 --> 00:58:39,950
How come?

1058
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:46,323
Because you knocked
on my door.

1059
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,659
All right, come on.
I'm trying to be serious here.

1060
00:58:48,693 --> 00:58:50,828
So am I.

1061
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:55,866
I wanted to spend
some time with you alone.

1062
00:58:55,900 --> 00:59:00,705
So that's what I did.

1063
00:59:00,738 --> 00:59:02,239
That's what I do.

1064
00:59:04,074 --> 00:59:07,945
Don't you think that was
a little irresponsible?

1065
00:59:07,978 --> 00:59:10,881
It was totally
irresponsible.

1066
00:59:10,915 --> 00:59:14,018
So then why did you do it?

1067
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:18,656
Come on, because
we connected the other night?

1068
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:22,292
Yes.

1069
00:59:22,326 --> 00:59:23,794
Because of that.

1070
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:26,997
And because...

1071
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:34,939
I haven't been able to get you
out of my head ever since.

1072
00:59:42,012 --> 00:59:44,314
I'm married, Matt.

1073
00:59:44,348 --> 00:59:45,716
And so are you.

1074
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:46,784
I know.

1075
00:59:48,953 --> 00:59:50,755
You know, you know,

1076
00:59:50,788 --> 00:59:53,290
Derrick's is pissing me off
right now, I still love him.

1077
00:59:55,693 --> 00:59:57,027
I know that, too.

1078
00:59:57,061 --> 00:59:59,096
Good...

1079
00:59:59,129 --> 01:00:03,067
'cause I would
never do anything
to hurt him or Christy.

1080
01:00:10,975 --> 01:00:12,843
What if Christy
was okay with it?

1081
01:00:18,382 --> 01:00:19,684
Okay with what?

1082
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:25,756
With me
joining your little harem?

1083
01:00:30,127 --> 01:00:31,762
Is that where you think
this is going?

1084
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,803
All right.

1085
01:00:38,836 --> 01:00:40,437
You know I'd actually need
to get back to studying

1086
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:41,872
so we should just go.

1087
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:53,383
Just for the record,

1088
01:00:53,417 --> 01:00:56,120
I don't actually
have a harem.

1089
01:01:02,026 --> 01:01:03,127
I know you don't.

1090
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:04,929
All right.

1091
01:01:04,962 --> 01:01:08,065
That was mean
and judgmental.

1092
01:01:08,098 --> 01:01:09,800
Yeah.

1093
01:01:09,834 --> 01:01:10,835
I'm sorry.

1094
01:01:10,868 --> 01:01:12,469
No, don't be sorry.

1095
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,471
Please.

1096
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:18,408
I love finding out
what you really think of us.

1097
01:01:18,442 --> 01:01:20,778
Okay, stop it
with the drama.

1098
01:01:20,811 --> 01:01:24,782
Okay, that is not
what I think.

1099
01:01:24,815 --> 01:01:28,485
Okay then,
let's have it.

1100
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:29,787
Have what?

1101
01:01:31,121 --> 01:01:32,923
What you do think.

1102
01:01:32,957 --> 01:01:37,127
Whatever you imagine
goes on with us.

1103
01:01:41,799 --> 01:01:44,001
All right, you know
I love you guys, right?

1104
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:46,804
Oh boy, where is this going?

1105
01:01:46,837 --> 01:01:48,806
Okay.

1106
01:01:48,839 --> 01:01:50,440
But I can never
tell Christy this

1107
01:01:50,474 --> 01:01:53,443
because I don't think
it was my place

1108
01:01:53,477 --> 01:01:58,115
but I just kind of
always felt like

1109
01:01:58,148 --> 01:02:02,119
the whole open marriage thing
was just sort of...

1110
01:02:04,454 --> 01:02:05,890
bullshit.

1111
01:02:05,923 --> 01:02:07,224
How so?

1112
01:02:07,257 --> 01:02:09,960
It's basically
legalized cheating.

1113
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:12,229
What?

1114
01:02:12,262 --> 01:02:14,231
I mean, come on,
am I wrong?

1115
01:02:14,264 --> 01:02:16,901
I know it might look
that way from the outside

1116
01:02:16,934 --> 01:02:20,470
I get it, but yes,
you're wrong.

1117
01:02:20,504 --> 01:02:23,140
I don't cheat on Christy.
On my wife.

1118
01:02:23,173 --> 01:02:25,142
Okay,
how do you not cheat

1119
01:02:25,175 --> 01:02:27,544
when you're sleeping
with other people?

1120
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:29,546
Was it cheating when you
and Derrick slept with us?

1121
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,148
No.

1122
01:02:31,181 --> 01:02:33,050
Okay, but well,
that's different

1123
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:35,886
because we talked
about it beforehand

1124
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,054
and we made
an agreement.

1125
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:39,089
Exactly.

1126
01:02:39,123 --> 01:02:41,058
Christy and I
made one too.

1127
01:02:41,091 --> 01:02:42,860
So what's
the difference between

1128
01:02:42,893 --> 01:02:46,263
agreeing for one night versus
an entire relationship?

1129
01:03:06,316 --> 01:03:09,186
Thanks
for checking up on me.

1130
01:03:09,219 --> 01:03:10,254
You're welcome.

1131
01:03:12,222 --> 01:03:16,060
And you know, I'm sorry
that I snapped at you.

1132
01:03:16,093 --> 01:03:18,896
Oh, don't worry
about that.

1133
01:03:18,929 --> 01:03:20,530
I deserved it.

1134
01:03:20,564 --> 01:03:23,067
Yeah, you did.
Mm-hmm.

1135
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:24,869
Why do
I ever admit fault?

1136
01:03:27,071 --> 01:03:29,073
But either way
I shouldn't have done it.

1137
01:03:29,106 --> 01:03:32,009
Okay, I'll accept your apology
if you'll accept mine.

1138
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:37,314
Deal.

1139
01:03:37,347 --> 01:03:39,216
Still friends?

1140
01:03:39,249 --> 01:03:40,584
Always.
Okay.

1141
01:04:43,147 --> 01:04:44,614
Oh, hey.

1142
01:04:44,648 --> 01:04:46,216
Hi.

1143
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:47,985
You on your way out?

1144
01:04:48,018 --> 01:04:49,954
I was just gonna
go downstairs

1145
01:04:49,987 --> 01:04:51,989
and talk to Christy
about something.

1146
01:04:52,022 --> 01:04:55,325
Well, I think
I just saved you a trip.

1147
01:04:58,996 --> 01:05:00,064
Hey.

1148
01:05:00,097 --> 01:05:03,000
Told you
I was gonna do it.

1149
01:05:03,033 --> 01:05:04,201
Do what?

1150
01:05:07,037 --> 01:05:10,407
Stage an intervention.

1151
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:12,309
You should've
seen him downstairs

1152
01:05:12,342 --> 01:05:15,079
moping around
like he lost his best friend.

1153
01:05:15,112 --> 01:05:17,014
I saw Derrick
pulling up outside

1154
01:05:17,047 --> 01:05:19,716
and I--
I thought all right,

1155
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:24,421
you guys are gonna sit down
and work this out.

1156
01:05:24,454 --> 01:05:27,324
Yeah.

1157
01:05:27,357 --> 01:05:32,096
So here we are.

1158
01:05:32,129 --> 01:05:34,098
Yeah.

1159
01:05:34,131 --> 01:05:36,633
All right,
let's do this.

1160
01:05:49,213 --> 01:05:51,615
And I, uh...

1161
01:05:54,384 --> 01:05:56,086
I realized that

1162
01:05:56,120 --> 01:06:01,091
I was way out of line
for all the things I said.

1163
01:06:02,326 --> 01:06:04,094
I was wrong.

1164
01:06:04,128 --> 01:06:06,596
And--so I want--

1165
01:06:09,133 --> 01:06:11,235
I want to say I'm sorry.

1166
01:06:14,338 --> 01:06:17,407
I was wrong,
too.

1167
01:06:19,409 --> 01:06:21,411
about a lot of things.

1168
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:34,091
See how easy that was?

1169
01:06:34,124 --> 01:06:37,294
And it only took,
like, ten seconds.

1170
01:06:40,764 --> 01:06:43,500
I mean,
unless you got something

1171
01:06:43,533 --> 01:06:44,768
you want
to apologize for, too.

1172
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:48,272
What?

1173
01:06:48,305 --> 01:06:51,808
I'm just saying,
since we're on a roll here

1174
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:55,045
if you got something you want
to confess, now is the time.

1175
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:59,749
No.

1176
01:06:59,783 --> 01:07:01,318
I'm good.

1177
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:02,486
Perfect.

1178
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:06,223
Because I need a drink.

1179
01:07:11,395 --> 01:07:12,796
Yeah, me too.

1180
01:07:28,478 --> 01:07:29,513
Picked your poison.

1181
01:07:31,548 --> 01:07:35,285
( phone rings )

1182
01:07:35,319 --> 01:07:37,421
Oh, great.
It's Robin.

1183
01:07:38,622 --> 01:07:39,823
Here, I'll talk with her.

1184
01:07:43,427 --> 01:07:44,761
Hey, Robin.

1185
01:07:44,794 --> 01:07:46,330
Yeah, no, no, no.

1186
01:07:46,363 --> 01:07:48,798
Sorry, it's just been
a crazy day.

1187
01:07:48,832 --> 01:07:50,334
What?

1188
01:07:50,367 --> 01:07:52,769
Right now, really?

1189
01:07:55,372 --> 01:07:56,473
She wants
to show us a place.

1190
01:07:56,506 --> 01:07:58,175
Not now.

1191
01:07:58,208 --> 01:08:01,145
Sure.
Sure.

1192
01:08:03,513 --> 01:08:04,848
She says, she thinks
that we will love it,

1193
01:08:04,881 --> 01:08:06,516
but we've got
to see it today.

1194
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:09,353
The listing's going out
in the morning.

1195
01:08:09,386 --> 01:08:10,420
All right.

1196
01:08:10,454 --> 01:08:12,456
Text us the address.

1197
01:08:12,489 --> 01:08:14,224
Yep, all right.

1198
01:08:14,258 --> 01:08:16,260
See you soon.
Thanks, bye.

1199
01:08:17,894 --> 01:08:19,363
You guys want
to come along?

1200
01:08:19,396 --> 01:08:21,531
Derrick,
they're probably tired.

1201
01:08:21,565 --> 01:08:24,134
Come on,
it's five minutes, in and out.

1202
01:08:24,168 --> 01:08:26,603
Yeah.
Sure.

1203
01:08:28,505 --> 01:08:30,274
All right,
come on in, guys.

1204
01:08:33,877 --> 01:08:35,545
Wow.
Nice.

1205
01:08:35,579 --> 01:08:37,247
It's beautiful,
isn't it?

1206
01:08:37,281 --> 01:08:39,816
It's a just under
2,000 square feet its--

1207
01:08:43,887 --> 01:08:45,455
I want to hear
about this one.

1208
01:08:46,623 --> 01:08:48,325
Okay.

1209
01:08:48,358 --> 01:08:51,228
It's got four bedrooms,
two and a half baths.

1210
01:08:51,261 --> 01:08:52,629
Um, it's got
a detached two-car garage,

1211
01:08:52,662 --> 01:08:55,131
and the owners already
replaced the roof.

1212
01:08:57,334 --> 01:08:59,269
God,
I love the windows.

1213
01:09:11,281 --> 01:09:14,351
So what do you think?

1214
01:09:14,384 --> 01:09:18,288
It's nice.

1215
01:09:18,322 --> 01:09:21,491
And what do you think?

1216
01:09:21,525 --> 01:09:24,561
I think--
it feels like us.

1217
01:09:27,231 --> 01:09:32,536
"Us" is in you and Derrick.

1218
01:09:32,569 --> 01:09:35,405
Me and Derrick are the only
"us" that I'm a part of, Matt.

1219
01:09:37,574 --> 01:09:40,510
What happened today
didn't happen.

1220
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:44,981
Yes, it did.

1221
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:47,684
Not if I say it didn't.

1222
01:09:47,717 --> 01:09:49,719
And we are not gonna
talk about this here.

1223
01:09:49,753 --> 01:09:52,322
We're not gonna talk
about this anywhere.

1224
01:09:52,356 --> 01:09:53,957
Ever again.

1225
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:55,459
Look, I'm not gonna--

1226
01:09:55,492 --> 01:09:57,627
DERRICK: April!

1227
01:09:57,661 --> 01:09:58,595
I'm in here!

1228
01:10:00,664 --> 01:10:02,699
Well,
what do you think?

1229
01:10:02,732 --> 01:10:06,002
I-- I love it.
Good.

1230
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:07,471
She says, she thinks
it's gonna go fast,

1231
01:10:07,504 --> 01:10:09,339
so if we want it,
we need to jump.

1232
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:16,646
Then I say let's jump.

1233
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:17,614
Perfect.

1234
01:10:19,516 --> 01:10:20,984
Robin did it.

1235
01:10:21,017 --> 01:10:22,352
I mean, she did it.

1236
01:10:22,386 --> 01:10:24,321
That was the one,
absolutely.

1237
01:10:24,354 --> 01:10:26,256
It's good. It's good.
It's beautiful.

1238
01:10:26,290 --> 01:10:27,991
It's roomy,
spacious enough for us.

1239
01:10:28,024 --> 01:10:29,659
Spacious?
Did you see the bathtub?

1240
01:10:29,693 --> 01:10:31,561
With the whirlpool jets
and everything?

1241
01:10:31,595 --> 01:10:35,399
I could just crawl inside
that thing and take a nap.

1242
01:10:35,432 --> 01:10:37,401
Well, anytime
you want to come over
and use it, just call.

1243
01:10:37,434 --> 01:10:39,403
Okay, I will.

1244
01:10:39,436 --> 01:10:41,971
I take that as an
open invitation.

1245
01:10:42,005 --> 01:10:43,773
APRIL: Okay, I hate
to break this to you,

1246
01:10:43,807 --> 01:10:46,343
but I think we just ended
with a permanent houseguest.

1247
01:10:46,376 --> 01:10:49,746
Yeah, I think we did.

1248
01:11:01,458 --> 01:11:02,392
What's up?

1249
01:11:10,334 --> 01:11:11,801
You okay?

1250
01:11:11,835 --> 01:11:13,737
Yeah.

1251
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:19,275
But there's something
I should probably tell you.

1252
01:11:27,584 --> 01:11:28,652
Four bedrooms.

1253
01:11:28,685 --> 01:11:30,019
I know.

1254
01:11:31,655 --> 01:11:34,324
One could be a nursery.

1255
01:11:34,358 --> 01:11:35,291
I know.

1256
01:11:38,595 --> 01:11:40,430
( knocking on door )

1257
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:46,803
All right, all right,
I should probably just get that.

1258
01:11:49,105 --> 01:11:50,674
I'll be right back.

1259
01:11:50,707 --> 01:11:52,542
I promise
I'll be right back.

1260
01:11:57,447 --> 01:11:58,848
Hey.

1261
01:11:58,882 --> 01:12:00,684
Are you fucking
kidding me?

1262
01:12:00,717 --> 01:12:02,452
I asked you.

1263
01:12:02,486 --> 01:12:04,988
I asked if Matt had been
with somebody else,

1264
01:12:05,021 --> 01:12:06,623
and you lied to me.

1265
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:09,092
You looked me
right in the eye and lied.

1266
01:12:09,125 --> 01:12:12,429
Hey, Christy,
just calm down, okay?

1267
01:12:12,462 --> 01:12:14,364
I don't know
what you're talking about,

1268
01:12:14,398 --> 01:12:15,865
and I never
have lied to you.

1269
01:12:15,899 --> 01:12:16,866
You did.

1270
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:18,502
You said Matt wasn't here

1271
01:12:18,535 --> 01:12:20,837
with another girl
the other day, but he was.

1272
01:12:20,870 --> 01:12:22,506
He was with you.

1273
01:12:22,539 --> 01:12:25,709
Christy, nothing happened
between me and Matt.

1274
01:12:25,742 --> 01:12:28,512
April, I know
you kissed him.

1275
01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:37,120
Okay, Christy, just listen.

1276
01:12:37,153 --> 01:12:38,688
Let me just explain, okay.

1277
01:12:38,722 --> 01:12:42,492
That was--that happen
sort of by accident.

1278
01:12:42,526 --> 01:12:44,127
Really?

1279
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:46,162
Really, was it by accident

1280
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:48,498
that you've been hanging out
with him ever since that night

1281
01:12:48,532 --> 01:12:50,567
and keeping it
a secret?

1282
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,402
But was it an accident
when you said

1283
01:12:52,436 --> 01:12:54,604
my whole relationship
was bullshit?

1284
01:12:57,541 --> 01:12:59,609
Yeah,
he told me everything.

1285
01:13:02,111 --> 01:13:03,513
He didn't have to tell me

1286
01:13:03,547 --> 01:13:07,584
how stupid I was
for trying to help you.

1287
01:13:07,617 --> 01:13:09,753
That part
I figured out for myself.

1288
01:13:13,790 --> 01:13:15,158
Wait Christy, just--

1289
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:45,455
I don't know
what to say, Derrick.

1290
01:13:45,489 --> 01:13:46,656
Just say what happened.

1291
01:13:51,795 --> 01:13:56,199
The morning
after we all were together,

1292
01:13:59,803 --> 01:14:03,707
I went looking for Christy
but she wasn't home.

1293
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:08,878
So I was really upset

1294
01:14:08,912 --> 01:14:12,716
because of all the things
you had said to me,

1295
01:14:12,749 --> 01:14:16,853
and I just--I just needed
somebody to talk to.

1296
01:14:16,886 --> 01:14:19,823
I don't need you to go
through all the details.

1297
01:14:19,856 --> 01:14:21,691
Just get to the part
where you fucked him.

1298
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,829
I didn't.

1299
01:14:25,862 --> 01:14:28,832
It was just a kiss.
Just one kiss.

1300
01:14:28,865 --> 01:14:30,033
And why should
I believe you?

1301
01:14:30,066 --> 01:14:31,835
Because that's the truth.

1302
01:14:31,868 --> 01:14:34,203
I don't think you know
what the truth is, April.

1303
01:14:34,237 --> 01:14:35,739
And I don't think you care.

1304
01:14:35,772 --> 01:14:37,106
You looked
at me every day,

1305
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:38,842
and kept your dirty
little secrets,

1306
01:14:38,875 --> 01:14:41,210
and let me walk around
here like a goddamn fool.

1307
01:14:41,244 --> 01:14:42,646
No, no, no.

1308
01:14:42,679 --> 01:14:45,248
It was not like that.

1309
01:14:45,281 --> 01:14:48,752
I promise you there weren't
any dirty little secrets.

1310
01:14:48,785 --> 01:14:51,521
God, nothing even happened
until today.

1311
01:14:51,555 --> 01:14:52,989
Is that
when you had sex with him?

1312
01:14:53,022 --> 01:14:56,760
Stop asking me that.

1313
01:14:56,793 --> 01:14:59,028
I already told you
I didn't sleep with him.

1314
01:14:59,062 --> 01:15:03,499
I'll stop asking
when I believe the answer.

1315
01:15:07,737 --> 01:15:10,506
The only time I slept with Matt
was when you were there.

1316
01:15:12,742 --> 01:15:14,544
Which sounds more
and more crazy to me

1317
01:15:14,578 --> 01:15:18,882
every time I hear myself
say it out loud, but that's it.

1318
01:15:18,915 --> 01:15:20,316
Okay, that's it.

1319
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:21,551
That's all
you're gonna get from me

1320
01:15:21,585 --> 01:15:22,752
because that's the truth.

1321
01:15:25,088 --> 01:15:28,792
You asked me if--if I'm--

1322
01:15:28,825 --> 01:15:33,062
I regretted us
hooking up with them.

1323
01:15:33,096 --> 01:15:35,632
And I told you
that I didn't.

1324
01:15:35,665 --> 01:15:38,868
And I still don't

1325
01:15:38,902 --> 01:15:42,939
because as stupid as it was,

1326
01:15:42,972 --> 01:15:45,541
it was a decision
that we made together.

1327
01:15:48,111 --> 01:15:51,047
But I do regret
everything else.

1328
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:56,285
And...

1329
01:15:56,319 --> 01:16:00,824
it's the only explanation
I have is that

1330
01:16:00,857 --> 01:16:03,660
I was wrong.

1331
01:16:07,931 --> 01:16:11,601
I just want to know
if you fucked him.

1332
01:16:11,635 --> 01:16:13,036
That's all.

1333
01:16:14,804 --> 01:16:15,739
No.

1334
01:16:20,376 --> 01:16:21,678
But you wanted to.

1335
01:16:25,949 --> 01:16:26,883
Yes.

1336
01:16:30,153 --> 01:16:33,356
But I didn't.

1337
01:16:33,389 --> 01:16:37,694
I would never ever do
anything like that to you.

1338
01:16:40,163 --> 01:16:42,832
Well, now you can.

1339
01:17:21,037 --> 01:17:22,972
( knocking on door )

1340
01:17:28,945 --> 01:17:30,847
Congratulations.

1341
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,982
You win.

1342
01:17:35,218 --> 01:17:37,921
I win what?

1343
01:17:37,954 --> 01:17:39,989
Derrick's gone.

1344
01:17:40,023 --> 01:17:41,691
He just left,

1345
01:17:41,725 --> 01:17:43,893
and I don't think
he's coming back.

1346
01:17:48,898 --> 01:17:50,767
Well, that's what
you wanted, isn't it?

1347
01:17:54,871 --> 01:17:57,073
I just wanted Christy
to know the truth.

1348
01:17:57,106 --> 01:17:59,175
Why?

1349
01:17:59,208 --> 01:18:03,446
So it could
get back to Derrick?

1350
01:18:03,479 --> 01:18:06,716
Matt, you had
to know that it would.

1351
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:08,051
I guess you're right.

1352
01:18:08,084 --> 01:18:10,754
I probably should've
thought of that.

1353
01:18:41,117 --> 01:18:44,087
She's got a point, you know.

1354
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,521
Why did you tell me?

1355
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:49,058
Was it because you knew
I would confront her?

1356
01:18:55,965 --> 01:18:57,867
Oh, my God.

1357
01:18:59,903 --> 01:19:03,873
You were trying
to break them up.

1358
01:19:08,144 --> 01:19:11,114
Oh, my God.

1359
01:19:11,147 --> 01:19:13,116
What the hell
is wrong with you

1360
01:19:13,149 --> 01:19:15,284
that is so far
beyond fucked up?

1361
01:19:15,318 --> 01:19:17,954
I can't even believe it.

1362
01:19:17,987 --> 01:19:19,455
No, no you are not!

1363
01:19:19,488 --> 01:19:21,024
You are not gonna leave--

1364
01:19:21,057 --> 01:19:22,258
we're gonna deal
with this right now!

1365
01:19:22,291 --> 01:19:23,927
I get it, Christy!
I fucked up!

1366
01:19:25,194 --> 01:19:26,529
Is that what do
you want me to say?

1367
01:19:26,562 --> 01:19:29,298
I want you to get this
through your head.

1368
01:19:29,332 --> 01:19:32,168
April doesn't want you,
she doesn't want us

1369
01:19:32,201 --> 01:19:35,571
and she doesn't
want our lifestyle.

1370
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:38,842
She wants her husband.

1371
01:19:38,875 --> 01:19:40,543
And if she didn't,

1372
01:19:40,576 --> 01:19:43,079
you wouldn't have needed
to sabotage their marriage.

1373
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:54,190
Are you in love with her?

1374
01:20:02,265 --> 01:20:03,199
No.

1375
01:20:06,569 --> 01:20:11,174
I thought I was
but I'm not.

1376
01:20:16,612 --> 01:20:19,148
I knew it.

1377
01:20:19,182 --> 01:20:20,616
I knew.

1378
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:24,087
Getting involved
with friends was a mistake.

1379
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:27,991
I told you it would
get complicated

1380
01:20:28,024 --> 01:20:31,160
but you made me feel like
I was worried over nothing.

1381
01:20:31,194 --> 01:20:35,198
I can't believe
I fell for that shit.

1382
01:20:35,231 --> 01:20:38,234
I'm really sorry.

1383
01:20:38,267 --> 01:20:39,936
I don't know
what else to say.

1384
01:20:41,905 --> 01:20:45,208
You don't have
to say anything, Matt.

1385
01:20:45,241 --> 01:20:46,842
You've done
enough damage.

1386
01:21:25,048 --> 01:21:26,282
( knocking on door )

1387
01:21:46,469 --> 01:21:47,971
Is he back?

1388
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:00,049
Did you try calling him?

1389
01:22:00,083 --> 01:22:03,686
I called.
I texted.

1390
01:22:03,719 --> 01:22:05,088
I emailed.

1391
01:22:07,490 --> 01:22:09,092
He won't talk to me.

1392
01:22:14,998 --> 01:22:16,299
Are you and Matt
breaking up?

1393
01:22:19,502 --> 01:22:21,437
I wouldn't give him
the satisfaction.

1394
01:22:27,010 --> 01:22:28,277
He will be paying
for this

1395
01:22:28,311 --> 01:22:30,079
for the rest
of his miserable life.

1396
01:22:30,113 --> 01:22:32,115
He'll beg for death
by the time I'm done.

1397
01:22:39,155 --> 01:22:41,057
I'm so sorry, Christy.

1398
01:22:46,129 --> 01:22:48,331
I know you are.

1399
01:22:48,364 --> 01:22:51,700
I mean it.

1400
01:22:51,734 --> 01:22:53,369
I really hate myself
right now.

1401
01:22:59,275 --> 01:23:00,976
I hate you too.

1402
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:12,721
Come here.

1403
01:23:50,426 --> 01:23:55,198
I tried calling you,
a lot.

1404
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:01,270
Where'd you sleep
last night?

1405
01:24:05,174 --> 01:24:06,575
All right, can you please
say something to me

1406
01:24:06,609 --> 01:24:08,444
so I know that
I still exist to you?

1407
01:24:08,477 --> 01:24:10,079
I'm looking
for my phone charger.

1408
01:24:10,113 --> 01:24:11,046
Have you seen it?

1409
01:24:13,449 --> 01:24:16,419
So we're not even gonna
try to work this out?

1410
01:24:16,452 --> 01:24:18,187
There's nothing
to work out.

1411
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:25,228
Derrick, don't you--
don't you think

1412
01:24:25,261 --> 01:24:27,463
you're being a little
melodramatic about this.

1413
01:24:30,866 --> 01:24:33,169
I mean,
it was just a kiss.

1414
01:24:36,239 --> 01:24:38,807
It was just one little kiss.

1415
01:24:44,147 --> 01:24:45,848
And I already admitted
that I was wrong.

1416
01:24:45,881 --> 01:24:49,485
I mean, what else
do you want from me?

1417
01:24:49,518 --> 01:24:51,820
I don't want
anything from you.

1418
01:24:51,854 --> 01:24:54,590
That's what
you don't understand.

1419
01:24:54,623 --> 01:24:58,327
There's nothing you can say
to make me trust you again.

1420
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:06,469
Well, if we don't
have that,

1421
01:25:06,502 --> 01:25:09,838
I-- I guess we
don't have anything.

1422
01:25:09,872 --> 01:25:11,274
I guess we don't.

1423
01:25:37,566 --> 01:25:39,235
Hey.

1424
01:25:40,369 --> 01:25:41,370
Hi.

1425
01:25:43,606 --> 01:25:45,874
Look, I--

1426
01:25:45,908 --> 01:25:49,878
I know that everything
that happened is my fault.

1427
01:25:49,912 --> 01:25:51,280
I screwed up.

1428
01:25:57,220 --> 01:25:59,288
I don't know what else to say.

1429
01:25:59,322 --> 01:26:02,191
Yeah, I don't either.

1430
01:26:02,225 --> 01:26:05,261
I just know that
I'm way past the point

1431
01:26:05,294 --> 01:26:09,332
of worrying about
who is at fault.

1432
01:26:12,968 --> 01:26:16,405
Do you think it would help
if I tried talking to him?

1433
01:26:18,341 --> 01:26:19,275
No.

1434
01:26:48,604 --> 01:26:51,407
What do you want?

1435
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:55,478
I want you to stop
being a dick.

1436
01:26:55,511 --> 01:26:57,380
Just leave me
alone, Christy.

1437
01:26:57,413 --> 01:27:00,549
Everybody is sorry, Derrick.

1438
01:27:00,583 --> 01:27:02,485
April's sorry.
Matt's sorry.

1439
01:27:02,518 --> 01:27:05,421
I'm sorry,
and I didn't even do anything.

1440
01:27:05,454 --> 01:27:09,258
Look, they cheated on us.

1441
01:27:09,292 --> 01:27:11,760
That might mean nothing
to you and your little world,

1442
01:27:11,794 --> 01:27:13,329
but it means a lot to me.

1443
01:27:13,362 --> 01:27:15,598
I'm not exactly thrilled
about it, either.

1444
01:27:15,631 --> 01:27:19,435
But we're not
talking about me.

1445
01:27:19,468 --> 01:27:24,039
You and April have
a strong relationship.

1446
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:25,608
You can get past this.

1447
01:27:25,641 --> 01:27:27,476
Not if I don't want to.

1448
01:27:29,077 --> 01:27:31,580
So you'd rather be
all morally outraged

1449
01:27:31,614 --> 01:27:33,248
than fix your marriage?

1450
01:27:35,618 --> 01:27:37,520
Just because you're wearing
that wedding ring

1451
01:27:37,553 --> 01:27:39,622
doesn't give you the right
to lecture me about marriage.

1452
01:27:39,655 --> 01:27:42,291
My marriage was real.

1453
01:27:42,325 --> 01:27:44,059
Not just
for show like yours.

1454
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:46,362
Okay, this whole thing

1455
01:27:46,395 --> 01:27:48,631
is as much your fault
as it is April's.

1456
01:27:48,664 --> 01:27:50,666
You went into it
with both eyes open,

1457
01:27:50,699 --> 01:27:53,068
and this is the stuff
that can sometimes happen.

1458
01:27:53,101 --> 01:27:55,538
Matt and I should've said no
to you guys in the first place.

1459
01:27:55,571 --> 01:27:57,306
But we didn't.
So here we are.

1460
01:27:57,340 --> 01:27:59,642
Yeah. Here we are.

1461
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:07,383
( knocking on door )

1462
01:28:12,821 --> 01:28:14,557
Hi, Robin.

1463
01:28:14,590 --> 01:28:16,559
Hi, I'm really sorry
to drop in on you like this,

1464
01:28:16,592 --> 01:28:18,093
but was
in the neighborhood

1465
01:28:18,126 --> 01:28:21,497
so I figured
I would drop this by.

1466
01:28:21,530 --> 01:28:22,365
What is this?

1467
01:28:22,398 --> 01:28:23,666
Your offer letter.

1468
01:28:23,699 --> 01:28:25,033
Now I don't mean
to rush you guys,

1469
01:28:25,067 --> 01:28:26,835
but I just want to hurry up
and get it signed

1470
01:28:26,869 --> 01:28:28,504
before anybody else
can squeak by us.

1471
01:28:28,537 --> 01:28:30,072
I'm sorry.

1472
01:28:30,105 --> 01:28:31,674
I should've called you.

1473
01:28:31,707 --> 01:28:34,577
I just assumed that
Derrick would have.

1474
01:28:34,610 --> 01:28:35,878
Oh, no.
It's okay.

1475
01:28:35,911 --> 01:28:38,481
Like I said, I was
in the neighborhood.

1476
01:28:38,514 --> 01:28:40,849
No, that's not what I mean.

1477
01:28:40,883 --> 01:28:44,553
Derrick and I--

1478
01:28:44,587 --> 01:28:48,524
wow, this
is embarrassing.

1479
01:28:48,557 --> 01:28:50,859
We're not buying the house.

1480
01:28:50,893 --> 01:28:52,495
We're not buying any house.

1481
01:28:52,528 --> 01:28:55,398
We're--we're not
together anymore.

1482
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:58,701
Oh, my god.

1483
01:28:58,734 --> 01:29:00,503
I'm so sorry to hear that.

1484
01:29:00,536 --> 01:29:01,670
Are you okay?

1485
01:29:01,704 --> 01:29:04,707
I'm fine.
Thank you.

1486
01:29:04,740 --> 01:29:06,709
Well, look I don't
want to interfere,

1487
01:29:06,742 --> 01:29:10,746
but if there's anything
I can do, please let me know.

1488
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:13,482
I will.

1489
01:29:18,153 --> 01:29:23,459
And April,
if it's any consolation,

1490
01:29:23,492 --> 01:29:24,593
I know
what you're going through.

1491
01:29:26,662 --> 01:29:28,130
I've been exactly
where you are.

1492
01:29:28,163 --> 01:29:29,898
Twice, in fact.

1493
01:29:29,932 --> 01:29:31,900
Really?

1494
01:29:31,934 --> 01:29:34,503
Two divorces under my belt.

1495
01:29:34,537 --> 01:29:37,039
Now the first one was
a mistake right from the start

1496
01:29:37,072 --> 01:29:39,642
but the second time

1497
01:29:39,675 --> 01:29:44,046
I should have worked a lot
harder to save that one.

1498
01:29:44,079 --> 01:29:46,749
Funny thing is,
the idea of refusing

1499
01:29:46,782 --> 01:29:48,651
to throw in the towel
was even an option.

1500
01:29:48,684 --> 01:29:50,152
But once we --

1501
01:29:50,185 --> 01:29:55,123
I'm sorry.
I'm--I have to go.

1502
01:29:58,461 --> 01:30:00,496
Thank you so much.

1503
01:30:27,122 --> 01:30:28,691
You can't be back here.

1504
01:30:28,724 --> 01:30:30,659
You promised me a house.

1505
01:30:32,628 --> 01:30:35,163
Go home.
We'll talk about it later.

1506
01:30:35,197 --> 01:30:38,601
You said that
if you kept working

1507
01:30:38,634 --> 01:30:42,838
and if I stayed in school that
we'd have a house of our own.

1508
01:30:42,871 --> 01:30:45,107
Well, we finally found one.

1509
01:30:45,140 --> 01:30:49,211
And it's just sitting there.

1510
01:30:49,244 --> 01:30:51,547
It's waiting for us.

1511
01:30:55,150 --> 01:30:58,554
Look, Robin brought over
the offer letter.

1512
01:30:58,587 --> 01:31:01,824
All-- all we have
to do is sign this

1513
01:31:01,857 --> 01:31:03,626
and the house is ours.

1514
01:31:03,659 --> 01:31:06,194
April, if you brought this
over here for me to sign--

1515
01:31:06,228 --> 01:31:08,096
No, that is not
why I came here.

1516
01:31:13,936 --> 01:31:15,270
April.

1517
01:31:15,303 --> 01:31:16,805
April,
what are you doing.

1518
01:31:16,839 --> 01:31:17,806
Are you crazy?
What?

1519
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:21,109
I love that house, Derrick.

1520
01:31:21,143 --> 01:31:23,111
I could grow old
in that house

1521
01:31:23,145 --> 01:31:25,648
but if it doesn't include you
I don't want it.

1522
01:31:28,150 --> 01:31:31,587
Derrick, I made a mistake.

1523
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:35,891
A lot of mistakes
I can admit that.

1524
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:39,762
But when you married me
you said that

1525
01:31:39,795 --> 01:31:43,699
you would love me
no matter what.

1526
01:31:43,732 --> 01:31:47,135
And this--this is
the "no matter what" part.

1527
01:31:48,971 --> 01:31:52,741
And I wish--I wish
I could change what happened

1528
01:31:52,775 --> 01:31:54,209
but I know that I can't.

1529
01:31:56,311 --> 01:31:59,682
But I also know that

1530
01:31:59,715 --> 01:32:01,550
I'm not leaving here
without my husband.

1531
01:32:01,584 --> 01:32:03,752
I'm not letting you go.

1532
01:32:03,786 --> 01:32:05,821
And what if this doesn't work?

1533
01:32:05,854 --> 01:32:09,592
What if we can't
get past this, huh?

1534
01:32:09,625 --> 01:32:11,660
We will.

1535
01:32:11,694 --> 01:32:14,597
We have to.

1536
01:32:14,630 --> 01:32:18,000
Because, Derrick--Derrick,

1537
01:32:18,033 --> 01:32:22,237
I don't want to keep
setting things on fire

1538
01:32:22,270 --> 01:32:24,006
and you know I would.

1539
01:32:24,039 --> 01:32:27,309
Just stay away
from my stove.

1540
01:32:27,342 --> 01:32:29,678
We'll talk about it later,
go home.

1541
01:32:29,712 --> 01:32:30,646
Yes.

1542
01:32:31,814 --> 01:32:34,683
Now get out of here.

1543
01:32:34,717 --> 01:32:36,752
And take this with you.

1544
01:32:36,785 --> 01:32:37,720
Go home.

1545
01:33:02,377 --> 01:33:05,280
That's it.
Truck's empty.

1546
01:33:05,313 --> 01:33:07,950
Oh, wow.

1547
01:33:07,983 --> 01:33:10,786
Well, thank you guys,
so much for all your help.

1548
01:33:10,819 --> 01:33:13,255
That's what
we're here for.

1549
01:33:13,288 --> 01:33:15,257
Hey, we got some beers
if you guys, want to hang.

1550
01:33:15,290 --> 01:33:17,693
That's okay.
We should get going.

1551
01:33:17,726 --> 01:33:20,963
Let you guys dig
through the mess.

1552
01:33:20,996 --> 01:33:23,265
So sweet of you
to leave like this.

1553
01:33:23,298 --> 01:33:24,967
I'm sweet.

1554
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,234
Thanks, Matt.

1555
01:33:27,903 --> 01:33:29,371
Yeah.
Okay.

1556
01:33:32,307 --> 01:33:33,676
Call you later.

1557
01:33:34,910 --> 01:33:36,378
Okay.
Oh, boy.

1558
01:33:36,411 --> 01:33:38,046
Now it begins.
Yeah.

1559
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:40,048
I was, like,
what's appropriate to wear?

1560
01:33:40,082 --> 01:33:40,983
He's your teacher.

1561
01:33:41,016 --> 01:33:42,417
Oh, well, good one.

1562
01:33:42,450 --> 01:33:43,986
I mean, I don't
want them to feel--

1563
01:33:44,019 --> 01:33:45,721
Yeah, don't
corrupt them now.

1564
01:33:45,754 --> 01:33:46,789
But I didn't
want them to.
Yeah.

1565
01:33:46,822 --> 01:33:48,891
Yeah, don't do that.

1566
01:33:48,924 --> 01:33:50,893
Oh, hey.

1567
01:33:50,926 --> 01:33:52,394
Hey, you must be
my new neighbors.

1568
01:33:52,427 --> 01:33:53,962
Yeah.
Hi, I'm Matt.

1569
01:33:53,996 --> 01:33:55,063
Nice to meet you.
Same here.

1570
01:33:55,097 --> 01:33:56,298
Jordan.

1571
01:33:56,331 --> 01:33:58,734
Hi. I'm Jordan.
Christy.

1572
01:33:58,767 --> 01:34:00,402
I'm Christy.

1573
01:34:00,435 --> 01:34:02,671
You're Jordan,
I'm Christy.

1574
01:34:02,705 --> 01:34:03,839
That's right.

1575
01:34:03,872 --> 01:34:05,173
Yeah, that cleared
it up.

1576
01:34:05,207 --> 01:34:07,275
Okay, you need a hand
with anything?

1577
01:34:07,309 --> 01:34:08,343
No, I don't have that much.
But thanks.

1578
01:34:08,376 --> 01:34:10,078
Well, welcome.

1579
01:34:10,112 --> 01:34:12,080
And you know, I guess
we'll see you around.

1580
01:34:12,114 --> 01:34:13,816
Definitely.
All right.

1581
01:34:15,050 --> 01:34:18,020
Nice talking to you.
Jordan.

1582
01:34:18,053 --> 01:34:19,387
Bye.

1583
01:34:45,948 --> 01:34:47,382
What are you thinking about?

1584
01:34:49,818 --> 01:34:52,054
Four bedrooms.

1585
01:34:52,087 --> 01:34:54,857
I'm thinking we actually
have four bedrooms.

1586
01:34:56,925 --> 01:34:58,060
I know.

1587
01:35:00,462 --> 01:35:02,297
One could be a nursery.

1588
01:35:03,932 --> 01:35:05,033
I know.

1589
01:35:08,403 --> 01:35:10,806
I love you.

1590
01:35:10,839 --> 01:35:12,407
I love you, too.
