00:01:40,703 --> 00:01:42,910
<i>Driver: There's a hundred thousand streets in the city.</i>

2
00:01:44,651 --> 00:01:47,893
<i>Now, you give me a time and a place.</i>

3
00:01:47,894 --> 00:01:54,118
<i> I give you a five-minute window,
anything happens in that five minutes and I'm yours...</i>

4
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:55,080
<i>No matter what.</i>

5
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:00,867
<i>Anything happens in either side of that,
then you are on your own.</i>

6
00:02:02,597 --> 00:02:03,754
<i>Do you understand?</i>

7
00:02:07,364 --> 00:02:08,365
<i>Good.</i>

8
00:02:11,443 --> 00:02:13,486
<i>And you won't be able to reach me on this phone again.</i>

9
00:02:45,412 --> 00:02:46,649
Hey, there you are!

10
00:02:47,741 --> 00:02:48,874
She's down there.

11
00:02:49,906 --> 00:02:51,808
Plain Jane boring, just like you asked for.

12
00:02:52,226 --> 00:02:55,331
But, I dropped in 300 horses on the inside,
She's gonna fly.

13
00:02:57,059 --> 00:02:58,262
You look like a zombie kid.
You get any sleep?

14
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,797
Can I offer you some Benzadrine,
Dextradine, Caffeine...Nicotine ???

15
00:03:03,798 --> 00:03:07,307
Oh you don't smoke, that's right.
You're better off.

16
00:03:09,054 --> 00:03:10,303
There she is!

17
00:03:11,956 --> 00:03:15,275
'Chevy Impala'
most popular car in the state of California.

18
00:03:16,786 --> 00:03:18,512
No one will be looking at you.

19
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,350
<i>Police P.A: All units be advised,
possible 731 in progress.</i>

00:13:01,764 --> 00:13:03,468
- Which floor?
- 4th please.

28
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,680
Director wants to see a rollover.

29
00:13:54,714 --> 00:13:55,885
You okay with that?

30
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:59,625
Remember, If you don't feel good;
just abort the shot.

31
00:13:59,626 --> 00:14:00,587
There's no shame in that,
Alright?

32
00:14:00,588 --> 00:14:04,274
You're doubling for the star.
It's not like you are A player or anything.

33
00:14:04,275 --> 00:14:06,791
And I got you $500 more. Huh?

34
00:14:06,792 --> 00:14:07,753
Of course we split that.

35
00:14:09,317 --> 00:14:10,851
You okay? Ready to go?

36
00:14:10,885 --> 00:14:12,441
Alright, I'm counting on you.

37
00:14:49,495 --> 00:14:50,845
Oh Kid!
That's fantastic.

38
00:14:50,846 --> 00:14:51,808
Just fantastic!

39
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:54,083
Okay, How're you doing?

40
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:57,101
You okay?
Good, that was perfect.

41
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:53,861
Where should I put these?

42
00:16:53,894 --> 00:16:55,671
In the kitchen.
Thank you.

43
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,203
Scary.

44
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:16,483
Hey, You want a tooth-pick?
- Sure.

45
00:17:23,441 --> 00:17:24,445
You want a glass of water?

46
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:26,305
Okay.

47
00:17:36,524 --> 00:17:37,720
Thanks.

48
00:17:41,885 --> 00:17:42,954
So, did you just moved to L.A?

49
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,093
No, I've been here for a while.

50
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,095
You are just new here?
- Mmhmm.

51
00:17:56,452 --> 00:17:57,895
That's Benicio's father.

52
00:18:00,155 --> 00:18:01,418
Where is he?

53
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,909
He's in prison.

54
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:08,125
What do you do?

55
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:11,922
I drive.

56
00:18:14,423 --> 00:18:15,862
Like a limo driver?

57
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:18,354
No, like for movies.

58
00:18:21,593 --> 00:18:23,276
Doing all those car chases and stuff?

59
00:18:24,439 --> 00:18:25,442
yeah.

60
00:18:25,443 --> 00:18:26,405
Isn't that dangerous?

61
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,326
It's only part time.

62
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,121
Mostly I work at the garage.
- Where?

63
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:44,625
Receda Boulevard.

64
00:18:53,102 --> 00:18:54,199
I gotta go.

65
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,508
Well, thank you.

66
00:18:59,891 --> 00:19:00,909
Thanks for the water.

67
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:02,916
Say bye.

68
00:19:42,398 --> 00:19:46,149
Chicken Chowmein?
And, some peking duck.

69
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:47,670
Where are the chopsticks?

70
00:19:49,127 --> 00:19:53,101
- uh ...the guy
- go get 'em. I don't want that.

71
00:19:54,918 --> 00:19:56,400
Chopsticks and a fortune cookie.

72
00:19:56,401 --> 00:19:59,128
Put out the fucking cigrette,
I'm eating.

73
00:20:00,186 --> 00:20:02,514
Sorry.
- What's the matter with you?

74
00:20:07,116 --> 00:20:10,329
You run a perfectly good business.
I don't know, why you wanna change that.

75
00:20:11,131 --> 00:20:13,148
You know how much
my business made last year?

76
00:20:13,149 --> 00:20:14,111
30 grand.

77
00:20:15,405 --> 00:20:19,844
I can build a car in six months
and in six seconds these jerks write it off as a stunt

78
00:20:19,878 --> 00:20:21,619
that won't even make it to the movie.

79
00:20:22,881 --> 00:20:25,459
See, all i need is a hard used start car.

80
00:20:26,352 --> 00:20:27,261
that's all.

81
00:20:27,294 --> 00:20:31,183
I figure we start off small town circuit;
we work our way up.

82
00:20:31,184 --> 00:20:33,859
Once we get to the show,
we are talking millions.

83
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,622
So, you still haven't give me your number.

84
00:20:42,865 --> 00:20:45,873
Alright, Four hundred thirty thousand dollars.

85
00:20:45,874 --> 00:20:46,836
Oh...!

86
00:20:46,837 --> 00:20:51,892
Mr.Ross, I wouldn't come to you with this.
Unless, I'm absolutely sure about it !

87
00:20:51,925 --> 00:20:53,960
How can you be sure, Shannon.

88
00:20:53,994 --> 00:20:56,653
What do you got that
the professional race team don't?

89
00:20:59,336 --> 00:21:00,875
I got a driver.

90
00:21:00,909 --> 00:21:03,268
You just told me there're half a dozen drivers.

91
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:04,230
Not like this one.

92
00:21:05,337 --> 00:21:06,652
This kid is special.

93
00:21:06,686 --> 00:21:09,482
Been working with him for a while,
I've never seen anybody like it.

94
00:21:09,483 --> 00:21:12,461
If I had the money,
I'd back him myself.

95
00:21:12,462 --> 00:21:13,423
Yeah, but you don't have the money.

96
00:21:15,601 --> 00:21:19,025
Mr.Ross,
You put this kid behind the wheel...

97
00:21:19,026 --> 00:21:19,987
there's nothing he cannot do.

98
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:27,137
What are you doing eating
chink food in my fucking restaurant?

99
00:21:27,138 --> 00:21:29,843
What's a Jew doing running a pizzaria?

100
00:21:29,844 --> 00:21:30,805
You remember Shannon?

101
00:21:35,163 --> 00:21:36,288
Take a fucking hike.

102
00:21:36,321 --> 00:21:37,771
I wanna talk to my partner.

103
00:21:40,792 --> 00:21:42,215
Hah, I'm just fucking with you.

104
00:21:43,529 --> 00:21:45,042
How're you doing Shannon.
How's the fucking leg?

105
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,622
I've paid my debt.

106
00:21:48,623 --> 00:21:52,178
I'll think about it. Okay?

107
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:53,901
But I wanna meet the kid first.

108
00:21:53,935 --> 00:21:55,835
That's all I ask.

109
00:22:08,135 --> 00:22:09,633
C'mon, I want you to meet somebody.

110
00:22:09,634 --> 00:22:12,767
Whatever you do like about the car,
don't say anything.

111
00:22:12,801 --> 00:22:14,300
I want to drive the price down a little bit.

112
00:22:14,301 --> 00:22:16,969
Kid, I want you to meet Mr.Bernie Ross.

113
00:22:18,442 --> 00:22:19,525
Nice to meet you.

114
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,340
My hands are a little dirty.

115
00:22:27,906 --> 00:22:29,332
So are mine.

116
00:22:33,501 --> 00:22:36,425
Good driving out there.
- Thanks.

117
00:22:40,907 --> 00:22:42,066
So? what do you think?

118
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,195
Do we get the 400?

119
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,233
I'll give you 300 for 70 percent.

120
00:22:49,976 --> 00:22:51,415
Done!

121
00:22:56,269 --> 00:22:57,722
you won't be sorry!

122
00:23:14,821 --> 00:23:16,913
Hey pal, just drop it down here.
We're pushing it alright.

123
00:23:16,947 --> 00:23:19,724
We wanna push her into number three.

124
00:23:19,758 --> 00:23:21,871
The car. Not you.
- Oh good.

125
00:23:21,872 --> 00:23:24,259
Hi...
- hi.

126
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,189
uhh...You two know each other?
- Don't.

127
00:23:28,222 --> 00:23:30,163
Oh look at that.

128
00:23:30,164 --> 00:23:31,126
We're neighbours.
- Neihhbours, very good.

129
00:23:31,126 --> 00:23:34,144
Well, we'll try to be neighbourly too.

130
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:55,199
You blinked.

131
00:23:55,998 --> 00:23:57,066
What?

132
00:23:58,058 --> 00:23:59,091
Can I call a cab from here.
- Yeah, sure.

133
00:24:01,542 --> 00:24:02,763
What am I talking 'bout.

134
00:24:02,764 --> 00:24:05,983
You and the kid are neighbours, right.
He can take you.

135
00:24:05,984 --> 00:24:07,956
Oh no.
I feel bad.

136
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:11,349
No, no...Don't even think twice about it.
He'll be happy to do it.

137
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,312
He's a good guy.

138
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:17,372
You know, he walked into my shop here
about five or six years ago...

139
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:20,534
right out of the blue,
asking for a job.

140
00:24:20,535 --> 00:24:23,436
So, i put him to the test,
to see what he could do.

141
00:24:24,836 --> 00:24:26,127
The kid is amazing.

142
00:24:26,128 --> 00:24:28,895
So, i hired him on the spot.
Boom!

143
00:24:28,896 --> 00:24:33,251
At about half the wages i normally pay.
He didn't even blink an eye.

144
00:24:33,252 --> 00:24:36,228
Hey kid,
come over here for a sec will you.

145
00:24:37,261 --> 00:24:39,912
And I have been exploiting him ever since.

146
00:24:42,268 --> 00:24:43,471
Don't tell him.

147
00:24:43,472 --> 00:24:46,764
Looks like we've bigger problem
than I thought.

148
00:24:46,765 --> 00:24:49,778
We're gonna have to keep
the car here for a few days.

149
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:53,692
So, I offered your services to take,
Benicio and Irene home.

150
00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:54,654
Would that be okay?

151
00:24:58,254 --> 00:24:59,857
Yeah sure.

152
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:05,028
I don't have wheels...
in my car.

153
00:25:06,532 --> 00:25:08,106
It's one think you should know about me.

154
00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:09,069
Well put the tyres on.

155
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:11,477
You got about five minutes?
- Yeah.

156
00:25:33,738 --> 00:25:35,398
Hey, do you wanna see something?

157
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,152
Yeah.

158
00:25:42,904 --> 00:25:44,027
okay.

159
00:27:35,592 --> 00:27:38,869
You did good.
We had a good time.

160
00:27:47,456 --> 00:27:49,651
Me too.

161
00:27:55,441 --> 00:27:57,788
Sorry, if I put you on the spot or anything.

162
00:27:57,822 --> 00:27:59,302
It's okay.

163
00:28:22,366 --> 00:28:23,904
I'm not doing anything this weekend.

164
00:28:29,298 --> 00:28:31,389
If you wanna go out or something.

165
00:30:02,373 --> 00:30:06,643
Don't worry about these bumps and bruises.
Thats easily replaceable.

166
00:30:06,644 --> 00:30:09,101
We coat a paint  on there with sponsors detail.

167
00:30:09,135 --> 00:30:11,528
Look at the thread on the tyre,
still good huh, we are in business.

168
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:16,301
You paid 300 fucking grand for this piece of shit?

169
00:30:16,335 --> 00:30:17,825
I paid for it.

170
00:30:17,826 --> 00:30:19,863
Out of my own pocket.

171
00:30:19,864 --> 00:30:20,826
This is just the shell.

172
00:30:20,827 --> 00:30:23,530
It's the inside that counts.
Not the outside.

173
00:30:23,563 --> 00:30:24,592
Right, Shannon?

174
00:30:24,626 --> 00:30:25,623
You are correct sir.

175
00:30:25,656 --> 00:30:28,510
Fuck that shit. If I paid 300 for something.
I want everybody to see it.

176
00:30:28,511 --> 00:30:29,472
Of course you do.

177
00:30:29,473 --> 00:30:31,599
Now this.

178
00:30:32,552 --> 00:30:36,167
That is one motherfucking fine ass pussy mobile,
motherfucker!

179
00:30:37,031 --> 00:30:38,212
Damn!

180
00:30:38,245 --> 00:30:40,181
Shannon, sell him that car.

181
00:30:40,182 --> 00:30:43,436
He won't be able to find a pussy
in a whorehouse.

182
00:30:43,437 --> 00:30:47,255
You know what?
This car will make you even good looking.

183
00:30:49,282 --> 00:30:50,255
How's it going?

184
00:30:53,776 --> 00:30:55,156
When's our first race?

185
00:30:57,588 --> 00:30:58,672
uhh, pretty soon.

186
00:31:00,098 --> 00:31:01,314
You gonna be ready?

187
00:31:03,339 --> 00:31:04,644
I hope so.

188
00:31:04,645 --> 00:31:05,606
huh...I hope so.

189
00:31:05,607 --> 00:31:09,331
Hey no false modesty.
I got a lot of money on this.

190
00:31:11,547 --> 00:31:13,252
Did Shannon ever tell you how we met?

191
00:31:16,449 --> 00:31:18,093
I used to produce movies.

192
00:31:18,094 --> 00:31:19,055
In the 80's.

193
00:31:19,056 --> 00:31:22,867
Kinda like action films and sexy stuff.

194
00:31:22,868 --> 00:31:23,829
One critic called them 'European'.

195
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:26,673
I thought they were shit.

196
00:31:27,148 --> 00:31:28,994
Anyway he arrange all the cars for me.
Did all the stunts.

197
00:31:28,995 --> 00:31:32,434
I liked him. I like having him around.

198
00:31:32,467 --> 00:31:34,703
Eventhough, he'd overcharge the shit out of me.

199
00:31:36,977 --> 00:31:38,322
His next business venture.

200
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:40,662
He got involved with some of Nino's friends.

201
00:31:40,663 --> 00:31:41,624
They didn't go for the overcharging bit.

202
00:31:43,351 --> 00:31:44,803
They broke his pelvis.

203
00:31:44,804 --> 00:31:47,095
He's never had a lot of luck.

204
00:31:49,485 --> 00:31:52,883
The reason I'm telling you this is,
He's got a lot invested in you.

205
00:31:52,917 --> 00:31:54,313
So do I.

206
00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:57,531
So. You need anything...
You call me.

207
00:31:57,531 --> 00:32:00,323
We're a team now.

208
00:32:02,731 --> 00:32:04,600
I'm excited.
Let's get out of here.

209
00:32:06,385 --> 00:32:07,535
Nino.

210
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:24,209
You see the bad guy?
- Yeah.

211
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,171
How can you tell?

212
00:32:27,876 --> 00:32:29,754
Cos he's a shark.

213
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,363
There's no good shark?

214
00:32:33,208 --> 00:32:35,541
No... I mean,
just look at him.

215
00:32:36,695 --> 00:32:38,153
Does he look like a good guy to you?

216
00:33:29,536 --> 00:33:30,960
That was my hausband's lawyer.

217
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:34,021
He's coming home in a week.

218
00:34:55,189 --> 00:34:58,487
You know, we're here celebrating.
Its a shameful thing...

219
00:35:00,345 --> 00:35:01,469
what I did.

220
00:35:02,898 --> 00:35:06,034
And I have a lot of making up to do,
to everyone.

221
00:35:11,757 --> 00:35:13,770
But second chances are rare.

222
00:35:13,803 --> 00:35:15,782
Right?

223
00:35:17,106 --> 00:35:18,980
And that's worth celebrating.
Right?

224
00:35:21,625 --> 00:35:25,395
So, I want to make a toast.
To that lady right there.

225
00:35:27,087 --> 00:35:30,792
Thanks for staying.
I love you, Inny.

226
00:35:32,232 --> 00:35:33,347
Salud.

227
00:36:43,836 --> 00:36:44,876
Hey?

228
00:36:46,478 --> 00:36:47,785
Hi.

229
00:36:55,191 --> 00:36:56,809
Sorry about the noise.

230
00:37:00,777 --> 00:37:02,220
I was gonna call the cops.

231
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,701
I wish you would.

232
00:37:10,648 --> 00:37:12,198
Oye, getting heavier.

233
00:37:16,808 --> 00:37:22,186
Hey, how are you doing?
- Hi.

234
00:37:22,219 --> 00:37:24,081
This guy has been telling a lot about you.

235
00:37:25,942 --> 00:37:27,782
He says, you've been coming around and
helping out a lot.

236
00:37:29,305 --> 00:37:31,310
Yeah? helping out.
Is that right?

237
00:37:33,499 --> 00:37:34,657
Is that right?

238
00:37:38,032 --> 00:37:39,532
That's very nice.
That's nice of you.

239
00:37:39,566 --> 00:37:41,527
Than you.
- You're welcome.

240
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:47,097
You drive for the movies?
- Yeah.

241
00:37:51,279 --> 00:37:52,976
I can take that.
- No, no. I got it.

242
00:37:57,106 --> 00:37:59,001
Let mommy talk to her friend.

243
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,130
You have a good night.

244
00:38:57,337 --> 00:38:58,714
You're Shannon's buddy, Right?

245
00:39:01,648 --> 00:39:02,757
We met last year.

246
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:06,423
You drove me and my brother
back from palm springs.

247
00:39:10,944 --> 00:39:12,597
We hired another wing man.

248
00:39:13,857 --> 00:39:15,834
I spend six months in jail and
my brother got himself killed.

249
00:39:20,627 --> 00:39:21,813
I've got a sweet job coming up.

250
00:39:21,814 --> 00:39:22,775
How about this?

251
00:39:22,776 --> 00:39:23,738
You shut you mouth.

252
00:39:23,739 --> 00:39:27,916
Or I'll kick your teeth down
your throat and i'll shut it for you.

253
00:39:36,183 --> 00:39:37,641
Nice seeing you again.

254
00:40:53,761 --> 00:40:54,928
come here.

255
00:40:56,338 --> 00:40:57,353
Don't be scared.

256
00:40:59,577 --> 00:41:02,253
Look, don't tell mommy. Okay?

257
00:41:05,431 --> 00:41:07,355
Okay, it's a secret between us boys.

258
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:11,017
Oh fuck.

259
00:42:09,022 --> 00:42:10,429
Who are they?

260
00:42:12,093 --> 00:42:13,898
What the fuck are you gonna do?
You gonna go and beat them out for me?

261
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:16,102
Huh, stunt guy.

262
00:42:17,874 --> 00:42:19,618
Why the fuck do you
wanna know who they are?

263
00:42:31,734 --> 00:42:34,810
There's some guy who want me to do a job for him,
But I'm not gonna do it.

264
00:42:40,073 --> 00:42:41,340
What's the job?

265
00:42:42,624 --> 00:42:44,586
He want me to rob a pawn shop in the valley.

266
00:42:47,078 --> 00:42:48,098
Why?

267
00:42:49,156 --> 00:42:51,164
Cos i owe them protection money,
for when i was in the inside.

268
00:42:51,165 --> 00:42:52,127
It's two thousand bucks.

269
00:42:54,028 --> 00:42:56,317
and as soon as I got out.

270
00:42:55,336 --> 00:42:58,594
Oh it's five thousand bucks.
Oh it's actually, Ten thousand dollars.

271
00:42:58,595 --> 00:43:01,251
Twenty thousand dollars,
tomorrow I don't know what it's gonna be.

272
00:43:04,482 --> 00:43:05,468
What are you gonna do?

273
00:43:06,779 --> 00:43:08,343
That's a very good question.

274
00:43:11,433 --> 00:43:13,844
They said they're gonna come after
Benicio and Irene next.

275
00:43:36,126 --> 00:43:37,378
You okay?

276
00:43:39,151 --> 00:43:40,395
You want something to drink?

277
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:46,109
What' s that you got there?

278
00:43:48,841 --> 00:43:50,093
Can I see?

279
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:04,602
One of those man gave you this?
- Mmmhm.

280
00:44:07,399 --> 00:44:08,619
They told me not to loose it.

281
00:44:13,603 --> 00:44:15,068
You want me to keep this for you?

282
00:44:16,178 --> 00:44:17,171
Okay.

283
00:44:41,293 --> 00:44:42,484
How's Benice?
- Good.

284
00:44:48,015 --> 00:44:49,505
You just saying that?

285
00:44:51,158 --> 00:44:54,107
No, what do you mean?

286
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,450
I saw that Standard...

287
00:45:00,484 --> 00:45:02,405
was in an accident.

288
00:45:02,438 --> 00:45:03,657
Yeah.

289
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:09,133
What happened?

290
00:45:12,906 --> 00:45:14,181
He got beat up.

291
00:45:18,267 --> 00:45:19,421
Why?

292
00:45:21,117 --> 00:45:22,490
Just drunk kids.

293
00:45:34,372 --> 00:45:35,363
You should come over.

294
00:45:38,614 --> 00:45:39,703
You should come and see him.

295
00:45:47,214 --> 00:45:48,236
You wanna...

296
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:50,749
You wanna hear a story?

297
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:53,032
You wanna hear how mommy and me met?
- Yeah.

298
00:45:56,278 --> 00:45:57,368
We're at a pary.

299
00:45:58,534 --> 00:45:59,851
And she was nineteen years old.

300
00:45:59,852 --> 00:46:01,422
- Seventeen.

301
00:46:01,423 --> 00:46:02,384
- You're not seventeen.
- I was.

302
00:46:02,385 --> 00:46:04,719
Wow, so that's illegal.

303
00:46:07,203 --> 00:46:11,714
Alright, so I illegally walked over
to a seventeen year old girl.

304
00:46:12,766 --> 00:46:13,864
I walked up and I say....

305
00:46:14,895 --> 00:46:16,116
<i>"Hello Miss"</i>

306
00:46:17,379 --> 00:46:18,522
<i>What is your name?</i>

307
00:46:19,709 --> 00:46:21,184
And she didn't say anything.

308
00:46:21,218 --> 00:46:23,669
<i>And I said, well...
my name's Standard Gabriel.</i>

309
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:25,883
Then what did you said.

310
00:46:31,157 --> 00:46:32,311
I said...

311
00:46:33,952 --> 00:46:35,517
<i>'Where's the deluxe version'</i>

312
00:46:45,514 --> 00:46:46,989
Oh man, that killed me.

313
00:46:51,116 --> 00:46:52,753
And then a year later,
You popped out man.

314
00:46:59,625 --> 00:47:00,953
Best day of my life.

315
00:47:42,231 --> 00:47:43,782
If I drive for you, you'll get your money.

316
00:47:43,815 --> 00:47:45,427
That's a guarantee.

317
00:47:46,802 --> 00:47:48,438
You tell me where we start,
Where we're going...

318
00:47:48,439 --> 00:47:49,401
Where we're going afterwards.

319
00:47:49,402 --> 00:47:51,855
I give you a five-minutes when we get there.

320
00:47:52,813 --> 00:47:55,259
Anything happens in that five minutes
and I'm yours no matter what.

321
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:56,221
Anything a minute either side of that...

322
00:47:56,222 --> 00:47:58,693
then you are on your own.

323
00:47:59,972 --> 00:48:01,198
I don't sit in while you're running it down;

324
00:48:02,246 --> 00:48:03,052
I don't carry a gun...

325
00:48:03,989 --> 00:48:05,186
I drive.

326
00:48:05,462 --> 00:48:06,773
You look like you are hard to work with.

327
00:48:08,351 --> 00:48:09,573
Not as long as we understand each other.

328
00:48:11,425 --> 00:48:12,705
What's there to understand?

329
00:48:12,738 --> 00:48:14,430
I cannot do this thing alone.

330
00:48:14,431 --> 00:48:15,393
You got Blanche.

331
00:48:15,394 --> 00:48:16,355
C'mon man.

332
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:20,507
She's beautiful,
Look at her.

333
00:48:23,642 --> 00:48:25,122
What the fuck are you rolling your eyes at for?

334
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:28,818
You know get the fuck out of here.

335
00:48:28,852 --> 00:48:29,896
Get up!

336
00:48:29,897 --> 00:48:32,297
Standard, take her with you,
and go get her a fucking coke.

337
00:48:39,403 --> 00:48:40,331
Okay here's the deal.

338
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:43,858
This much for Blanche,

339
00:48:46,274 --> 00:48:48,736
This much for that asshole...
Minus what he owes me.

340
00:48:50,566 --> 00:48:52,218
And this much for you.

341
00:48:56,395 --> 00:48:57,630
You're still interested?

342
00:49:00,095 --> 00:49:00,932
Good!

343
00:49:00,933 --> 00:49:01,894
Anything else?

344
00:49:03,938 --> 00:49:05,346
When you get your money,

345
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:06,565
His debt's paid.

346
00:49:06,566 --> 00:49:07,528
His out for good.

347
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:10,958
You never go near his family ever again.

348
00:49:12,763 --> 00:49:13,991
Do you understand?

349
00:49:18,265 --> 00:49:19,581
To my family.

350
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:21,054
To my new friend.

351
00:49:22,936 --> 00:49:26,325
And toast to the future.

352
00:49:29,127 --> 00:49:30,105
Our future.

353
00:49:54,251 --> 00:49:55,287
I'll see you in five minutes.

354
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:02,932
See you in four.

355
00:54:31,957 --> 00:54:33,507
How much did Cook said,
we're gonna get?

356
00:54:37,415 --> 00:54:38,469
- Fourty Grand.

357
00:54:47,237 --> 00:54:48,159
Stay here.

358
00:55:07,127 --> 00:55:08,645
Cop: When was the last time you saw your hausband?

359
00:55:12,848 --> 00:55:14,688
Can you answer...
the question?

360
00:55:24,611 --> 00:55:25,348
<i>Benicio: Hello?</i>

361
00:55:25,382 --> 00:55:27,065
Benicio, Is that you?

362
00:55:27,066 --> 00:55:28,028
<i>- Yeah.</i>

363
00:55:31,373 --> 00:55:32,424
Your mother there?

364
00:55:32,457 --> 00:55:36,999
<i>- Uh she's sitting down...
talking to a police.</i>

365
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:40,905
Okay, just tell her I'm gonna call her back.
Okay?

366
00:55:40,938 --> 00:55:42,804
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

367
00:55:45,982 --> 00:55:47,920
<i>TV reporter: He's been identified as Standard Gabriel,</i>

368
00:55:47,921 --> 00:55:48,882
<i>Of Echo Park, L.A.</i>

369
00:55:48,883 --> 00:55:51,115
<i>Other details are unclear but...</i>

370
00:55:51,149 --> 00:55:54,298
<i>the owner of the pawn shop, told the reporter
that Gabriel acted alone.</i>

371
00:55:54,577 --> 00:55:56,737
<i>and that, the items he had stolen
has been recovered.</i>

372
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,583
If he saw you take the money...

373
00:56:23,246 --> 00:56:24,800
and saw you get in the car;

374
00:56:27,375 --> 00:56:28,847
then why didn't they say anything?

375
00:56:30,901 --> 00:56:32,131
- I have no idea.

376
00:56:43,642 --> 00:56:45,709
Did you have any idea that
there would  be a second car?

377
00:56:50,966 --> 00:56:52,941
I already told you, I didn't.

378
00:56:58,792 --> 00:57:00,734
Now, you've just got a little boy's father killed.

379
00:57:02,345 --> 00:57:03,615
and you almost got us killed.

380
00:57:04,887 --> 00:57:06,372
and now, you are lying to me.

381
00:57:06,373 --> 00:57:08,421
So, how about this?

382
00:57:09,957 --> 00:57:15,068
From now on, every words out of your mouth is the truth.

383
00:57:16,084 --> 00:57:17,509
Or i'm gonna hurt you.

384
00:57:19,208 --> 00:57:20,777
Do you understand?

385
00:57:21,897 --> 00:57:23,590
Now, what did Cook tell you?

386
00:57:25,207 --> 00:57:27,214
He said there'd be another car hold us up.

387
00:57:27,247 --> 00:57:29,705
But he didn't say anything about all these money.

388
00:57:29,706 --> 00:57:32,819
he didn't say anything about anyone
getting killed.

389
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,652
And he was gonna rip us off?

390
00:57:42,864 --> 00:57:44,059
What's his real name?

391
00:57:44,093 --> 00:57:46,414
He said it's Chris...
But i just call him Cook.

392
00:57:51,544 --> 00:57:54,492
You're gonna take me to him...
right now.

393
00:57:56,866 --> 00:57:58,112
Do you understand?

394
00:57:58,113 --> 00:58:00,435
- Yeah.

395
01:01:18,411 --> 01:01:20,773
This guy Cook,
he have a real name?

396
01:01:20,807 --> 01:01:23,192
Chris.

397
01:01:25,049 --> 01:01:26,244
Maybe.

398
01:01:28,533 --> 01:01:30,985
I'll ask Bernie,
see if he knows him.

399
01:01:33,375 --> 01:01:35,806
Jesus!
I can't stop thinking about...

400
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,745
what we could do with all that dough.

401
01:01:37,746 --> 01:01:39,323
Would you stop?
- Alright!

402
01:01:39,324 --> 01:01:41,495
You know, a lot of guys messing around
with married women...

403
01:01:41,529 --> 01:01:44,938
but you're the only one I know who robs a joint,
to pay back the hausband.

404
01:01:46,054 --> 01:01:46,941
Crazy!

405
01:01:48,009 --> 01:01:48,878
Don't worry about it.

406
01:01:48,911 --> 01:01:50,581
I'll take care of it.

407
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:22,342
Where's Cook?

408
01:02:22,376 --> 01:02:23,642
He's in the dressing room.

409
01:02:24,984 --> 01:02:26,032
Where's that?

410
01:02:27,423 --> 01:02:28,572
It's over there.

411
01:02:47,515 --> 01:02:48,792
You're a fucking dead man.

412
01:02:57,466 --> 01:02:58,651
Whose money do i have?

413
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:01,777
Don't worry...
they're gonna come and get it.

414
01:03:05,101 --> 01:03:05,988
Call them.

415
01:03:06,022 --> 01:03:07,612
Somebody call Nino.

416
01:03:19,334 --> 01:03:20,263
Do you remember this?

417
01:03:43,985 --> 01:03:44,761
Hello?

418
01:03:46,270 --> 01:03:46,987
Nino?

419
01:03:47,021 --> 01:03:49,845
No, sorry pal.
Why don't you call back later, we're closed.

420
01:03:50,987 --> 01:03:53,658
I could, but i think Nino would be upset
that you made him wait.

421
01:03:55,272 --> 01:03:56,609
- Can I ask what this is about?

422
01:03:56,610 --> 01:03:59,174
I have something of his.

423
01:04:00,445 --> 01:04:01,630
- And that would be?

424
01:04:02,838 --> 01:04:04,270
A million dollars.

425
01:04:05,996 --> 01:04:06,842
- Please hold.

426
01:04:13,947 --> 01:04:15,845
Nino: You have something that
fucking belongs to me.

427
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:22,627
Seems that way.

428
01:04:25,776 --> 01:04:27,953
- And you're calling me...

429
01:04:27,987 --> 01:04:29,300
-  Why?

430
01:04:31,206 --> 01:04:33,044
-  You're expecting to buy my own shit back from you?

431
01:04:33,078 --> 01:04:34,419
I'm not selling it.

432
01:04:34,453 --> 01:04:37,957
I'm gonna give you a time and place,
and you're gonna come and get it.

433
01:04:37,958 --> 01:04:40,175
Do you Understand?

434
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:43,337
- What are you getting out of it?

435
01:04:44,919 --> 01:04:45,797
Just that.

436
01:04:47,188 --> 01:04:48,467
'Out of it.'

437
01:04:49,818 --> 01:04:51,006
- And your partners are happy with that?

438
01:04:53,397 --> 01:04:54,642
I don't have any partners.

439
01:04:56,488 --> 01:04:59,536
- you discuss this with anybody else?

440
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:02,348
No, just with you.

441
01:05:04,198 --> 01:05:06,012
- You're not very good at this.
Are you?

442
01:05:57,318 --> 01:05:58,543
Can I talk to you for a minute?

443
01:06:00,576 --> 01:06:01,977
- I can't talk,
I have to go.

444
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:06,920
Can I just walk with you...for?

445
01:06:27,936 --> 01:06:28,970
I have to tell you something.

446
01:06:35,732 --> 01:06:37,738
Standard was into some...

447
01:06:37,739 --> 01:06:41,969
guys in prison for a lot of money.

448
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,934
And it would ruin you and benicio
if he wouldn't pay it.

449
01:06:50,813 --> 01:06:52,203
He asked me for my help.

450
01:06:56,177 --> 01:06:57,979
It just went wrong,
you know.

451
01:07:01,402 --> 01:07:02,283
I'm sorry.

452
01:07:07,802 --> 01:07:08,854
I still got the money.

453
01:07:13,413 --> 01:07:15,043
You can have it,
if you wanted to.

454
01:07:18,283 --> 01:07:19,918
You can take Benicio...and.

455
01:07:31,344 --> 01:07:33,561
I just thought,
we could get out of here. If you wanted.

456
01:07:37,396 --> 01:07:38,488
I could come with you.

457
01:07:42,860 --> 01:07:44,295
I could look out for you.

458
01:07:49,494 --> 01:07:51,886
Sorry...uh...
Wrong floor.

459
01:11:07,995 --> 01:11:09,287
He came into my apartment, Shannon.

460
01:11:11,673 --> 01:11:12,914
How did they know where I live?

461
01:11:15,333 --> 01:11:16,567
- I told you,
I was gonna call Bernie.

462
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:17,977
I just want him know that...

463
01:11:18,011 --> 01:11:20,715
that it wasn't about that,
you are not interested in the money.

464
01:11:20,748 --> 01:11:22,126
and that you just did it for the girl.

465
01:11:28,468 --> 01:11:30,004
You told him about Irene!!!

466
01:11:35,992 --> 01:11:38,535
I just wanted him to know that...

467
01:11:38,569 --> 01:11:41,213
as soon as you return the money,
that was the end of it.

468
01:11:41,246 --> 01:11:44,688
I didn't know.
How was I suppose to know that?

469
01:11:44,722 --> 01:11:45,874
Okay?

470
01:11:46,457 --> 01:11:48,367
Look, let me just talk to Bernie..
Okay?

471
01:11:49,937 --> 01:11:51,857
Why did you have to fuck everything up, Shannon?

472
01:11:53,592 --> 01:11:54,969
Why did you have to fuck everything up?

473
01:12:01,231 --> 01:12:02,304
They're gonna come looking for me.

474
01:12:02,337 --> 01:12:03,509
and they're gonna come for you.

475
01:12:04,870 --> 01:12:05,738
Do you understand?

476
01:12:05,739 --> 01:12:07,857
You gotta get out of here.

477
01:12:07,891 --> 01:12:09,216
and you gotta get out now.

478
01:12:10,450 --> 01:12:12,527
Listen to me.
Listen to me, Shannon.

479
01:12:15,189 --> 01:12:17,028
You get out of here and you never fucking come back.

480
01:12:18,893 --> 01:12:20,318
You never come back.

481
01:12:26,406 --> 01:12:27,650
What are you gonna do?

482
01:12:44,422 --> 01:12:45,994
I already gave you my advice.

483
01:12:47,214 --> 01:12:49,646
You should've taken the money,
and left the guy alone.

484
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:50,958
- It's just not that simple Bernie.

485
01:12:50,991 --> 01:12:53,570
No! of course not!
Now everything's bounced up in your face!

486
01:12:54,343 --> 01:12:56,903
You know, I owe you this guy.
Just give me a little time and I'll get rid of him.

487
01:12:56,936 --> 01:12:59,019
Shut the fuck up.

488
01:12:59,052 --> 01:13:01,037
You fucking monkey!

489
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:06,125
The money, belongs to some half-assed wise guy,
out of Philly. Now...

490
01:13:06,126 --> 01:13:07,243
I got tipped off...

491
01:13:07,277 --> 01:13:10,851
he was stashing a million bucks in a pawn shop;
He's gonna invest it here in L.A

492
01:13:10,884 --> 01:13:13,141
He was gonna set up a rival operation.

493
01:13:13,174 --> 01:13:15,694
So, you stole from the east-coast mob?

494
01:13:15,728 --> 01:13:18,134
No! I stole from some jump up punk.

495
01:13:18,897 --> 01:13:20,571
He was trying to step on our action.

496
01:13:20,572 --> 01:13:24,472
Yeah... then why didn't you come to me,
before you set up this dummy robbery?

497
01:13:26,314 --> 01:13:27,819
Before you hire this piece of shit.

498
01:13:27,852 --> 01:13:30,968
This was something on the side, Bernie.
I didn't wanna involve you on this.

499
01:13:31,002 --> 01:13:32,469
Well, I'm involved now!

500
01:13:35,116 --> 01:13:36,204
Let me tell you something...

501
01:13:36,238 --> 01:13:43,649
Anybody...anybody!
Finds out you stole from the family, we are both dead.

502
01:13:44,217 --> 01:13:45,417
What fucking family?

503
01:13:46,739 --> 01:13:48,867
The family who still calls me a fucking kike?

504
01:13:50,430 --> 01:13:51,713
To my face!

505
01:13:53,065 --> 01:13:57,715
You know, I'm fifty nine years old Bernie,
they still pinched my cheek like i'm some fucking kid.

506
01:13:59,661 --> 01:14:00,573
Family.

507
01:14:00,606 --> 01:14:03,251
The money flows up, easy.

508
01:14:03,252 --> 01:14:05,100
You know that.

509
01:14:06,415 --> 01:14:08,099
That's why this driver's gotta go, Bernie.

510
01:14:09,861 --> 01:14:10,684
He's gotta go.

511
01:14:10,718 --> 01:14:12,709
and your pal, Shannon.

512
01:14:12,742 --> 01:14:16,072
it's these two guys,
that can tie me to this robbery.

513
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:56,765
Now, it's your turn to clean up after me.

514
01:15:58,386 --> 01:15:59,981
All this priceless cars...

515
01:16:00,015 --> 01:16:02,120
One would think you'd have better locks.

516
01:16:06,550 --> 01:16:07,806
Doors is always open to you.

517
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:09,571
Going somewhere?

518
01:16:15,471 --> 01:16:16,835
I was thinking about it.

519
01:16:18,230 --> 01:16:19,793
I'm looking for your driver.

520
01:16:22,151 --> 01:16:24,378
You breaking in here,
I figure its bad news.

521
01:16:24,412 --> 01:16:25,712
No, Shannon.

522
01:16:25,746 --> 01:16:27,457
It's bad luck.

523
01:16:28,395 --> 01:16:31,694
Two thousand  heist a year in this city,

524
01:16:31,728 --> 01:16:33,767
he has to pick the wrong one.

525
01:16:34,758 --> 01:16:35,872
He tried to put it right.

526
01:16:35,906 --> 01:16:38,047
Well, he picked the wrong guy for that too.

527
01:16:38,081 --> 01:16:41,963
My partner is a belligerent asshole,
with his back against the wall.

528
01:16:43,478 --> 01:16:44,711
Right now, so am I.

529
01:16:45,963 --> 01:16:48,065
If I don't set this straight,
I'm in big trouble.

530
01:16:51,948 --> 01:16:53,739
Any idea where he might be?

531
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:58,256
Mexico.

532
01:16:58,257 --> 01:17:00,931
or maybe it was Balise.

533
01:17:04,310 --> 01:17:05,385
really?

534
01:17:11,977 --> 01:17:14,311
I was excited about this whole thing.

535
01:17:15,272 --> 01:17:16,726
my name on a car!

536
01:17:17,767 --> 01:17:19,459
I mean, look how beautiful.

537
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:22,694
I wanted to see my name on this thing.

538
01:17:25,276 --> 01:17:27,272
I think we would've made a go with this business.

539
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:43,557
Don't worry.

540
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:44,491
Don't worry.

541
01:17:44,525 --> 01:17:45,292
That's it.

542
01:17:45,326 --> 01:17:48,821
It's done.
There is no pain, its over. Its over.

543
01:24:44,687 --> 01:24:45,424
<i>Nino.</i>

544
01:24:46,610 --> 01:24:47,347
<i>Nino???</i>

545
01:24:52,291 --> 01:24:53,469
You know who this is.

546
01:24:55,362 --> 01:24:56,081
<i>Where's Nino?</i>

547
01:24:59,079 --> 01:24:59,823
He's gone.

548
01:25:03,645 --> 01:25:05,505
<i>I think this has gone on long enough.</i>

549
01:25:07,227 --> 01:25:09,286
<i>You see any reason for this to continue?</i>

550
01:25:11,310 --> 01:25:12,944
<i>What do you say we meet?</i>

551
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:17,555
Why would I wanna do that?

552
01:25:19,052 --> 01:25:19,840
<i>Well...</i>

553
01:25:19,873 --> 01:25:23,433
<i>You, me and your girlfriend are the only players left.</i>

554
01:25:23,467 --> 01:25:25,610
<i>How's that for a reason?</i>

555
01:25:27,975 --> 01:25:28,859
When?

556
01:25:29,888 --> 01:25:30,859
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

557
01:25:32,132 --> 01:25:33,285
<i>There's a place on Sherman Way...</i>

558
01:25:33,319 --> 01:25:35,440
<i>there's a restaurant called ' The Great Wall'</i>

559
01:25:35,473 --> 01:25:36,272
<i>You know it?</i>

560
01:25:37,175 --> 01:25:38,410
I'll find it.

561
01:26:04,211 --> 01:26:05,441
Can I talk to you?

562
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:09,889
I won't keep you long.

563
01:26:14,892 --> 01:26:16,679
I have to go somewhere now.

564
01:26:18,216 --> 01:26:19,816
I don't think I can come back.

565
01:26:24,513 --> 01:26:26,041
I just want you to know...

566
01:26:28,345 --> 01:26:32,113
Just getting to be around you...
was the best thing that ever happened to me.

567
01:27:23,004 --> 01:27:24,220
Did you bring the money?

568
01:27:30,563 --> 01:27:32,059
Here's what I'm prepared to offer...

569
01:27:33,293 --> 01:27:35,044
You give me the money,
the girl is safe.

570
01:27:36,112 --> 01:27:39,170
Forever, nobody knows about it.
She's off the limits.

571
01:27:41,327 --> 01:27:43,083
I can't offer you the same.

572
01:27:44,646 --> 01:27:46,246
So, this is what I would suggest.

573
01:27:47,623 --> 01:27:49,382
We conclude our deals...
we shake hands.

574
01:27:50,701 --> 01:27:52,596
You'll start the rest of you life.

575
01:27:55,418 --> 01:27:59,135
Any dreams you have,
plans or hopes for the future;

576
01:27:59,169 --> 01:28:01,988
I think you got to put that on holds.

577
01:28:03,582 --> 01:28:05,803
For the rest of your life,
you're gonna be looking over your shoulder.

578
01:28:05,837 --> 01:28:09,836
I'm just telling you this,
b'cos I want you to know the truth.

579
01:28:11,606 --> 01:28:12,865
But the girl is safe.
