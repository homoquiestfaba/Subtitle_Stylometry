00:01:02,798 --> 00:01:06,185
- Ok.. ok.. uh i like this.
- Hmm hmm.

2
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:08,911
Maybe this time we get lucky, like a baby?

3
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:10,542
Let's just have some fun.

4
00:01:10,917 --> 00:01:12,045
Oh i like fun.

5
00:01:12,313 --> 00:01:13,952
Just shut up and kiss me.

6
00:01:18,575 --> 00:01:21,142
- Ah ouch! Hold on.
- Sorry.

7
00:01:21,704 --> 00:01:23,738
This damn watch.

8
00:01:26,263 --> 00:01:27,509
Come on..

9
00:01:34,505 --> 00:01:35,755
What's wrong..

10
00:01:40,406 --> 00:01:41,558
You feel that?

11
00:01:42,741 --> 00:01:43,789
No..?

12
00:01:48,763 --> 00:01:49,847
It stopped.

13
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:51,771
That's weird i didn't hear anything.

14
00:01:54,609 --> 00:01:55,705
Baby are you ok?

15
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,275
Yeah, I'm ok.

16
00:01:58,644 --> 00:02:00,033
What was that?

17
00:02:00,907 --> 00:02:03,763
Oh my God... right there.

18
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:06,674
What is that?

19
00:02:08,897 --> 00:02:12,938
Hello, how's our little guy this morning?

20
00:02:13,749 --> 00:02:16,205
Hello how are you?

21
00:02:16,683 --> 00:02:19,241
Oh look at you! Look at you!

22
00:02:19,842 --> 00:02:21,826
Oh oh, yeah kick it!

23
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,715

00:02:42,725 --> 00:02:44,987
Look at this overall looks like a mini you.

26
00:02:48,547 --> 00:02:50,889
Look at you putting your
little butt in the air.

27
00:02:50,956 --> 00:02:55,977
- Yeah you are gonna work on the farm like daddy.
- Yes! Just like a Breyer.

28
00:03:02,529 --> 00:03:05,312
- Bye..
- Bye!

29
00:03:23,346 --> 00:03:24,428
Brandon.

30
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:32,576
It's time to get ready for school.

31
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:39,549
Gotcha!

32
00:03:52,845 --> 00:03:54,380
Not even close!

33
00:03:56,985 --> 00:03:58,731
I'm gonna find you.

34
00:03:59,928 --> 00:04:01,680
Better not be in that barn.

35
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,483
You totally got me!

36
00:05:01,864 --> 00:05:04,008
You are getting too big for this.

37
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,644
But you'll always be my baby boy.

38
00:05:10,947 --> 00:05:12,015
Ok let's go.

39
00:05:12,198 --> 00:05:13,438
Took you long enough to find me.

40
00:05:17,714 --> 00:05:18,934
- Uh oh.
- Morning guys.

41
00:05:19,282 --> 00:05:20,813
- Ehy.
- What were you doing in there?

42
00:05:20,831 --> 00:05:22,477
- I was just..
- Hide and seek.

43
00:05:22,597 --> 00:05:24,828
You know the rules on the barn right?

44
00:05:24,968 --> 00:05:25,906
Yeah, i mean..

45
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,387
Come on, all those boards and the other
shit, i don't want you breaking your neck.

46
00:05:29,571 --> 00:05:31,736
He was only in there for like two minutes.

47
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,909
Did you eat breakfast?

48
00:05:34,037 --> 00:05:35,000
Not yet.

49
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,682
- Want some waffles?
- Yeah sounds good.

50
00:05:36,683 --> 00:05:37,778
Yeah! You are making waffles?

51
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:39,816
- Yeah i'm making waffles.
- What about some bacon.

52
00:05:42,486 --> 00:05:45,800
And that is what we call a hive.

53
00:05:47,456 --> 00:05:51,909
Wasps and bees both members of
the same insect family,

54
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,949
both with two pairs of wings,
both with stingers.

55
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:57,652
Can anyone tell me any
differences between them?

56
00:06:03,913 --> 00:06:04,909
Mr. Breyer?

57
00:06:07,132 --> 00:06:11,441
Well, bees are pollinators and
wasps are predators.

58
00:06:11,736 --> 00:06:13,393
Good, good. Anybody else?

59
00:06:13,394 --> 00:06:16,917
And wasps are more aggressive,
more dangerous,

60
00:06:17,205 --> 00:06:21,128
one species the "Polistes Sulcifer" is
what's called a Brood parasite,

61
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:27,230
they've lost the ability to make nests, so they use brute
force to make other wasp species raise their young

62
00:06:27,338 --> 00:06:31,150
and they make them feed their babies
things like beetle larvae and maggots.

63
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:34,873
Well why you are always talking
about maggots? You must be one.

64
00:06:36,876 --> 00:06:38,111
Ok.. alright.

65
00:06:38,686 --> 00:06:41,768
Don't worry, smart guys
end up ruling the planet.

66
00:09:15,773 --> 00:09:16,640
Brandon?

67
00:09:23,308 --> 00:09:24,328
Brandon.

68
00:09:37,815 --> 00:09:38,684
Brandon?

69
00:09:51,762 --> 00:09:52,622
Brandon.

70
00:10:18,027 --> 00:10:18,991
Brandon..

71
00:10:24,942 --> 00:10:25,948
Brandon..

72
00:10:29,808 --> 00:10:30,829
Brandon..

73
00:10:33,064 --> 00:10:33,960
Brandon..

74
00:10:37,392 --> 00:10:38,310
Brandon..

75
00:10:41,777 --> 00:10:44,338
Brandon.. ehy.. ehy.

76
00:10:47,739 --> 00:10:49,475
- Ehy, ehy, it's me, it's mom.
- What's going on, where am i?

77
00:10:49,664 --> 00:10:52,013
It's mom, mom. Look at me.

78
00:10:52,202 --> 00:10:55,049
Ehy, you are alright. You are alright.

79
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,885
You are alright.

80
00:11:00,397 --> 00:11:02,413

sleepwalking i think.

81
00:11:02,701 --> 00:11:07,333

this voices or something..

00:11:08,284 --> 00:11:11,923
Well you are ok now. You are ok now.

83
00:11:18,842 --> 00:11:22,932
~Please don't worry about a thing.~

84
00:11:23,821 --> 00:11:28,835
~Every little thing is gonna be alright.~

85
00:11:30,495 --> 00:11:36,453
~No don't worry about a thing~.

86
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:43,227
~Every little thing is gonna be alright.~

87
00:11:44,848 --> 00:11:50,126
~No don't worry about a thing.~

88
00:11:59,902 --> 00:12:00,917
Everything alright?

89
00:12:02,164 --> 00:12:06,050
Yeah he was.. sleepwalking i guess?

90
00:12:07,287 --> 00:12:08,397
Where?

91
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:13,113
No just.. he was downstairs, he is fine.

92
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:17,531
We should go to bed yeah?
It's getting so late.

93
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,584
Hold one of these.

94
00:12:24,037 --> 00:12:25,800
Alright i think it's gonna hold it.

95
00:12:28,467 --> 00:12:30,275
- Do you want one of these?
- Sure.

96
00:12:33,036 --> 00:12:35,190
First couple of years after we adopted you,

97
00:12:36,263 --> 00:12:38,418
i had no clue how to be a dad..

98
00:12:38,797 --> 00:12:42,073
and your mom she was out one day,
and you were balling your eyes out,

99
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:43,806
but i had the secret weapon.

100
00:12:44,428 --> 00:12:46,689
So you gave me a piece of candy?

101
00:12:47,789 --> 00:12:49,067
Yep!

102
00:12:50,948 --> 00:12:52,078
Did it work?

103
00:12:52,526 --> 00:12:55,846
I guess.. you didn't turn up
that bad did you? Uh?

104
00:12:58,722 --> 00:13:01,469
Alright, you'll go get the lawn because
i've got to get to the seed store.

105
00:13:01,549 --> 00:13:03,159
Yeah no worries, i'll handle it.

106
00:13:05,426 --> 00:13:06,426
Dammit.

107
00:13:09,447 --> 00:13:10,448
Come on.

108
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:16,225
Stupid thing.

109
00:14:18,598 --> 00:14:21,037
Oh you are not beating me, i love it!

110
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,395
That's how you shoot. That's how you shoot.

111
00:14:23,457 --> 00:14:25,706
What about this brown one?
I think it's easy to pick up.

112
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:26,946
Right there, right there..

113
00:14:36,363 --> 00:14:44,221
~Happy birthday dear Brandon.
Happy birthday to you.~

114
00:14:44,562 --> 00:14:47,361
- Congrats!
- There you go.

115
00:14:48,694 --> 00:14:49,935
This is for little kids.

116
00:14:49,936 --> 00:14:52,612
Oh come on, make a wish! Thank you Erica.

117
00:14:52,613 --> 00:14:54,521
I didn't think they were gonna
bring it. It's pretty nice.

118
00:14:54,522 --> 00:14:58,662
Yeah if you don't want it, slide it
on over here i'll take it.

119
00:15:02,576 --> 00:15:04,459
So Brandon i hear you
are killing it in school.

120
00:15:04,469 --> 00:15:05,890
He tested in the top 1%.

121
00:15:06,063 --> 00:15:09,186
No he tested in the top 1/10th of 1%.

122
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:11,346
Yeah the whole faculty
it's talking about him.

123
00:15:11,517 --> 00:15:13,047
He is our little secret genius.

124
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:17,811
So a special guy deserves
a very special present,

125
00:15:17,955 --> 00:15:21,737
this is from me and your aunt Merilee.

126
00:15:23,219 --> 00:15:24,606
Go ahead open it!

127
00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:28,183
I shot my first buck with
that very same model.

128
00:15:29,994 --> 00:15:32,663
Woah, woah, no, no, no. No guns!

129
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:34,267
- We talked about this Tori.
- I know.. but...

130
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,579
No come on, he's still just a kid.

131
00:15:37,179 --> 00:15:37,840
I'm 12 years old.

132
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,594
I know, exactly, you are still a child.

133
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:42,836
Give it to me.

134
00:15:43,773 --> 00:15:45,321
I'm sorry what did you say to me?

135
00:15:45,603 --> 00:15:47,595
I said: give it to me!

136
00:15:49,013 --> 00:15:49,808
Brandon..

137
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,125
Ok, we are done here. We are not having
mexican, thank you so much. Brandon let's go.

138
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:56,604
Brandon, come on, let's go! Brandon!

139
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:58,456
Up! Now!

140
00:15:58,669 --> 00:16:01,445
Brandon.. listen to your father.

141
00:16:03,346 --> 00:16:05,147
We are leaving. Let's go.

142
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:08,347
Thank you guys. So fun, thank you so much.

143
00:16:08,526 --> 00:16:12,298
- Ok, sorry. So sorry.
- Don't even worry about it.

144
00:16:14,996 --> 00:16:16,340
I love you guys.

145
00:16:17,822 --> 00:16:21,066
- Babe, i've told you.
- Are you sure you want kids?

146
00:16:21,487 --> 00:16:23,241
I just don't get that kid.

147
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,807
Turns 12 and all of the sudden
there's a mouth on him?

148
00:16:25,808 --> 00:16:28,188
It is so strange, it was so unlike him.

149
00:16:29,693 --> 00:16:31,359
Don't worry about him.

150
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,141
He is getting older.. changing.

151
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,551
We were so much worst when we were his age.

152
00:16:37,841 --> 00:16:41,161
Do you remember all the running
around we did, sneaking out,

153
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,166
- fooling around in my parents basement.
- Yeah.

154
00:16:44,318 --> 00:16:46,664
- You know my parents knew exactly
what we were doing back then. - Yeah.

155
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:49,790
They just didn't give a shit. They had
already written me off at that point.

156
00:16:49,936 --> 00:16:51,280
Aaw babe.

157
00:16:52,334 --> 00:16:54,909
We can never do that to Brandon.

158
00:16:56,074 --> 00:17:00,304
- He needs to know we give a shit.
- He will know.

159
00:17:03,258 --> 00:17:05,032
Ehy why don't we go camping this weekend?

160
00:17:05,678 --> 00:17:08,005
Just the three of us, go to Drivewood.

161
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:10,223
We haven't done that in so long.

162
00:17:10,423 --> 00:17:12,808
You know what else we
haven't done in so long..

163
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:17,664
I know what you are
thinking.. gone to church..

164
00:17:17,665 --> 00:17:22,762
- We have not gone to church in a while.
- Yeah, that's not at all what i was thinking about.

165
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,802
- We need to clean up the closet, that's what you were thinking.
- No, no, no.

166
00:17:28,783 --> 00:17:31,334
- Ok, but you gotta be quite,
- I will be quite, i'm always quite,

177
00:18:44,528 --> 00:18:45,528
What is that?

178
00:18:47,051 --> 00:18:48,799
It's like his idea of porn?

179
00:18:48,971 --> 00:18:49,898
I think so.

180
00:18:49,899 --> 00:18:51,971
- Woah.
- Bras..

181
00:18:52,096 --> 00:18:54,056
I guess i knew this day was coming.

182
00:18:55,046 --> 00:18:56,406
What is that?

183
00:18:57,509 --> 00:18:59,384
It's this like a guy thing?

184
00:18:59,544 --> 00:19:01,614
No that's not any guy thing i know.

185
00:19:04,517 --> 00:19:06,748
Maybe we should have "The Talk" with him.

186
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:19,027
Ehy Brandon..

187
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:22,304
you know you just had your birthday,

188
00:19:23,324 --> 00:19:26,554
wich means that you are
becoming a young man and uhm..

189
00:19:27,323 --> 00:19:28,993
your body is changing.

190
00:19:29,886 --> 00:19:30,798
Ok.

191
00:19:30,845 --> 00:19:33,557
Well we start developing, you know,

192
00:19:34,777 --> 00:19:37,630
feelings about women, women's bodies..

193
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,935
I was just like you when i was your age,

194
00:19:41,788 --> 00:19:44,120
i also thought about girls all the time.

195
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:48,039
You know, nobody was around to tell me that,

196
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:54,257
it was ok to.. uh..
touch it or play with it..

197
00:19:55,793 --> 00:19:56,789
With what?

198
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:03,874
Ah you know with.. your penis.

199
00:20:06,323 --> 00:20:07,467
Ok.

200
00:20:08,054 --> 00:20:11,721
Look the thing about,
you know, sex, it's not..

201
00:20:11,722 --> 00:20:14,775
it's not about organs or body parts..

202
00:20:14,968 --> 00:20:17,697
i mean, you know, it is that too but..

203
00:20:19,258 --> 00:20:22,563
you know, it's about finding the right
person and then falling in love.

204
00:20:25,536 --> 00:20:28,712
Look all i'm saying is:
You are a guy, you know,

205
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:31,383
and you are gonna have
certain urges, you know,

206
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:36,527
about girls you see in films or
girls in class or whatever..

207
00:20:37,022 --> 00:20:40,534
and i'm just saying that it's ok
to give into them now and again.

208
00:20:41,935 --> 00:20:43,335
Like.. now?

209
00:20:44,562 --> 00:20:45,463
What?

210
00:20:47,501 --> 00:20:48,809
Like now.

211
00:20:50,129 --> 00:20:53,943
No, no, no, not.. not right now. No.

212
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:58,870
Good talk.

213
00:21:20,016 --> 00:21:20,941
Brandon.

214
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,405
Mom!

215
00:23:01,326 --> 00:23:03,836
What's wrong? What's wrong?

216
00:23:04,423 --> 00:23:06,197
Someone's there by the curtain.

217
00:23:28,461 --> 00:23:29,975
Honey there's no one here.

218
00:23:30,139 --> 00:23:32,778
You have to believe me he was right there!

219
00:23:33,377 --> 00:23:34,595
Who was?

220
00:23:35,735 --> 00:23:37,997
Brandon Breyer.

221
00:23:39,639 --> 00:23:40,813
Brandon?

222
00:23:45,974 --> 00:23:46,938
Brandon!

223
00:23:48,665 --> 00:23:50,188
Brandon where are you baby?

224
00:23:50,814 --> 00:23:51,991
Can you hear me?

225
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:53,497
Brandon.

226
00:23:55,027 --> 00:23:56,061
Brandon!

227
00:23:59,275 --> 00:24:02,264
Oh my god. Oh my god Brandon..

228
00:24:02,265 --> 00:24:04,207
your father and i are totally freaked out!

229
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:06,172
I didn't mean to, i was just taking a pee.

230
00:24:15,715 --> 00:24:21,125
So you don't think i need to take him
to someone like a specialist.. there's..

231
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:26,992
No. For what? For talking back to his dad and
keeping literature material under his matress?

232
00:24:27,062 --> 00:24:33,324
It's like he's always been, you know,
my little sweet guy and now..

233
00:24:34,448 --> 00:24:36,470
- he is so different.
- It's called puberty.

234
00:24:38,163 --> 00:24:41,427
- So i'm over-reacting, wich i obviously am.
- A little, a little, a little bit.

235
00:24:41,428 --> 00:24:43,533
- I love you.
- Thank you.

236
00:24:43,534 --> 00:24:45,781
- I'll call you. Thanks Mer.
- Ok call me later, bye.

237
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:55,210
What's that?

238
00:24:56,167 --> 00:24:57,302
What?

239
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:59,360
I wasn't snooping or anything.

240
00:25:00,145 --> 00:25:03,085
Most of the line work. It's good shading.

241
00:25:34,182 --> 00:25:35,489
Fucking wolf.

242
00:25:47,636 --> 00:25:50,253
Brandon, ehy what are you doing buddy?

243
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:02,088
Buddy it's 10:30 at night.

244
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:07,301
Are you all right buddy?

245
00:26:14,637 --> 00:26:15,762
Think so.

246
00:26:19,629 --> 00:26:20,972
Come on man, let's get inside.

247
00:26:50,878 --> 00:26:52,209
Oh my God.

248
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:55,444
Tori, Tori, Tori ehy!

249
00:26:55,953 --> 00:26:58,728
- Wake up, i need you to come outside.
- What is it? Ok.

250
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:01,320
- See? Right?
- Oh shit.

251
00:27:04,644 --> 00:27:06,172
So the wolf is back.

252
00:27:06,173 --> 00:27:09,279
No.. no baby.. i.. this isn't a wolf i mean,

253
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,454
this isn't an animal, i think..

254
00:27:12,871 --> 00:27:14,417
i think this might be Brandon.

255
00:27:15,218 --> 00:27:18,278
He was out here, early tonight,
just staring at them..

256
00:27:18,489 --> 00:27:20,602
and the chicken they were
all fucking going crazy.

257
00:27:22,815 --> 00:27:27,295
Babe a wolf can't do this! It can't rip
a freaking door open and break a lock!

258
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:29,570
And your twelve years old son can?

259
00:27:30,086 --> 00:27:31,509
So you can't explain it either.

260
00:27:33,548 --> 00:27:37,444
Kyle stop, it was the wolf.
I'm going to bed.

261
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:42,493
Ok guys this came is called:
Willows in the wind.

262
00:27:42,683 --> 00:27:45,052
It's about walking togheter,
building trust.

263
00:27:45,352 --> 00:27:47,866
Lean back and depend on your classmates.

264
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:51,505
Oh come on now, focus.

265
00:27:55,014 --> 00:27:59,886
Alright, very good guys. When we
trust each other good things happen.

266
00:28:00,155 --> 00:28:02,324
Alright, you are our next big guy.
Let's hear it for Brandon

267
00:28:03,976 --> 00:28:06,440
Nothing to be afraid of, your
classmates have your back.

268
00:28:13,657 --> 00:28:14,603
Good job.

269
00:28:16,764 --> 00:28:17,790
Oh shit!

270
00:28:18,932 --> 00:28:20,484
Way to trust the fall, Breyer!

271
00:28:20,485 --> 00:28:21,869
Ehy, ehy, knock it off!

272
00:28:22,176 --> 00:28:25,485
You ok bud? Dammit Caitlyn
give him a hand up.

273
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:30,882
- Ehy hold on, we're all on the same team here.
- He is a pervert!

274
00:28:32,108 --> 00:28:32,935
Liar.

275
00:28:33,016 --> 00:28:36,812
Caitlyn help him up or
you'll fail this class.

276
00:28:47,177 --> 00:28:49,419
- What are you doing?
- Brandon.

277
00:28:49,426 --> 00:28:52,520
- Let go.. stop it!
- Brandon.. Brandon stop!

278
00:28:55,106 --> 00:28:59,646
Erica he said he's sorry, it was an
accident they are just kids.

279
00:28:59,827 --> 00:29:01,937
Did you see my daughter's hand?

280
00:29:02,258 --> 00:29:04,318
He is a goddamn animal is what he is.

281
00:29:04,485 --> 00:29:06,690
Ehy can we just calm
down here, Erica please?

282
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:08,570
I want him in handcuffs
and i want him gone.

283
00:29:08,718 --> 00:29:11,354
We are taking action, Brandon
is going to be suspended for two days.

284
00:29:11,525 --> 00:29:13,911
Suspended?! Do your job
arrest him!

285
00:29:13,912 --> 00:29:15,812
I'm sorry ma'am that's not your call.

286
00:29:15,888 --> 00:29:19,725
After the suspesion he will be in regular
sessions with our school counselor miss Merilee.

287
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:24,467
- His aunt? Oh Jesus fucking Christ.
- Right now she is the only counselor..

288
00:29:37,349 --> 00:29:39,026
Do you even know who his real mother is?

289
00:29:39,472 --> 00:29:40,475
I'm his real mother.

290
00:29:40,476 --> 00:29:42,611
I meant whatever in-bread
psycho gave birth to him

291
00:29:42,862 --> 00:29:45,401
- Ehy!
- I know exactly what you meant,

292
00:29:46,674 --> 00:29:50,793
If trash-talking a 12 years old child,
lets you sleep better at night Erica..

293
00:29:51,506 --> 00:29:53,312
maybe you are the one who needs help.

294
00:29:56,152 --> 00:29:57,579
I'm sorry about your daughter.

295
00:30:00,221 --> 00:30:01,578
Get up, let's go.

296
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:20,051
I never did shit like that,
breaking a girl's hand? Goddamit.

297
00:30:21,475 --> 00:30:22,933
My dad would whoop my ass.

298
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:27,345
Yeah well, this isn't something
we can ass-whip away

299
00:30:29,968 --> 00:30:35,016
I need to tell you something, the other
night when i've found him sleepwalking

300
00:30:35,172 --> 00:30:38,681
he wasn't downstairs, he was in the barn.

301
00:30:42,274 --> 00:30:43,362
Did he find it?

302
00:30:43,536 --> 00:30:48,556
No, no, but he was talking at the trapdoor.

303
00:30:49,164 --> 00:30:51,636
- How does he even know what's in there?
- I don't know think he does,

304
00:30:52,691 --> 00:30:54,165
It was like he was drawn to it.

305
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:57,341
Babe, he may look like us and
sound like us..

306
00:30:57,513 --> 00:31:02,161
but he's never bled, not once in his
whole life, he's never been cut or..

307
00:31:02,791 --> 00:31:06,274
broken a bone or had a bruise.
And now it's hurting people!

308
00:31:29,833 --> 00:31:30,828
Take..

309
00:31:33,098 --> 00:31:34,205
Take..

310
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:38,705
..means take.

311
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:46,981
Brandon!

312
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:51,795
Oh God.

313
00:33:03,021 --> 00:33:03,956
Take..

314
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:06,735
Take..

315
00:33:08,427 --> 00:33:10,086
Take the..

316
00:33:10,587 --> 00:33:13,505
Oh God.. Brandon!

317
00:33:13,705 --> 00:33:15,517
Take the..

318
00:33:17,802 --> 00:33:19,605
Take the..

319
00:33:22,532 --> 00:33:23,415
Brandon!

320
00:33:23,947 --> 00:33:25,226
Brandon..

321
00:33:29,949 --> 00:33:30,997
Oh Brandon..

322
00:33:35,295 --> 00:33:37,558
Baby, are you ok?

323
00:33:44,113 --> 00:33:45,000
Baby..

324
00:33:48,966 --> 00:33:50,319
It cut me!

325
00:33:55,121 --> 00:34:01,622
Ok.. you are gonna be ok.

326
00:34:01,918 --> 00:34:06,224
You are gonna be ok, ok, ok.
You are gonna be ok.

327
00:34:08,194 --> 00:34:09,457
Who am i?

328
00:34:19,722 --> 00:34:21,220
You're our son.

329
00:34:23,093 --> 00:34:26,994
What is this? Where did i come from?

330
00:34:28,662 --> 00:34:35,181
Listen baby, i know it's been difficult for you
lately, that you feel different from other kids..

331
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,663
You are different.

332
00:34:39,849 --> 00:34:44,788
After your dad and i got married we
prayed and prayed for a baby for so long

333
00:34:46,082 --> 00:34:49,835
to God, to the universe, or anyone
that was listening and then..

334
00:34:50,059 --> 00:34:56,714
one night, one perfect night, someone listened.

335
00:34:59,868 --> 00:35:03,917
We did not adopt you from an agency.

336
00:35:05,726 --> 00:35:10,922
You came here, arrived here in that.

337
00:35:14,442 --> 00:35:19,613
We found you in the woods,
you were just a little guy all alone..

338
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:23,834
you could barely breathe and
so we, we took you in

339
00:35:24,814 --> 00:35:29,148
and you've been a gift,
my baby boy..

340
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:34,878
i can't even imagine how overwhelmed
you must feel right now..

341
00:35:35,697 --> 00:35:41,380
but you have to know that your dad and i
we believe that you came here for a reason

342
00:35:41,786 --> 00:35:46,290
that you are special and that you
are going to do incredible th..

343
00:35:46,291 --> 00:35:49,431
- You lied to me!
- We just wanted to take care of you..

344
00:35:49,432 --> 00:35:52,359
- You lied to me! You lied!
- and we always planned how to..

345
00:35:54,744 --> 00:35:59,693
I hate you! You lied to me!
You liars, everything you lie!

346
00:36:00,378 --> 00:36:03,487
- I hate you, i hate this place!
- Ehy what's going on in here..

347
00:36:04,349 --> 00:36:09,983
He found it.. he found it.

348
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,823
Take.. the..

349
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:17,863
Take.. the..

350
00:36:22,756 --> 00:36:25,752
Take.. the.. world.

351
00:36:28,113 --> 00:36:29,558
Take the world.

352
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:54,024
- Don't scream.
- What are you doing here?

353
00:36:55,311 --> 00:37:00,308
- I brought you flowers.
- You can't be here.

354
00:37:01,656 --> 00:37:05,024
Don't be scared, i want to talk to you.

355
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,700
I want to tell you what
i've learned tonight.

356
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:16,475
I learned that i'm very special.

357
00:37:18,879 --> 00:37:23,247
You are one of the only people in the
world that knows how special i am.

358
00:37:24,571 --> 00:37:28,666
But someday they will all know.

359
00:37:32,013 --> 00:37:34,104
My mom told me not to talk to you.

360
00:37:37,169 --> 00:37:38,818
I'm gonna take care of that.

361
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:55,652
Have a good one Gary.

362
00:38:51,783 --> 00:38:53,644
Ehy who's messing with me?

363
00:38:57,414 --> 00:38:58,862
Is that you Gary?

364
00:40:17,055 --> 00:40:18,165
Get out of here!

365
00:40:23,973 --> 00:40:25,440
Leave me alone!

366
00:41:21,244 --> 00:41:22,104
Is he awake?

367
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:25,660
I've called up two times already,
i heard him walking around.

368
00:41:25,661 --> 00:41:27,619
Should somebody go get him?
I mean..

369
00:41:28,346 --> 00:41:31,468
- Morning.
- Ehy bud.

370
00:41:32,807 --> 00:41:34,589
You know you are gonna
be late for school, right?

371
00:41:34,653 --> 00:41:37,859
Yeah i know, i was just in my room, thiking.

372
00:41:39,439 --> 00:41:40,541
Thinking about what?

373
00:41:42,858 --> 00:41:46,301
Just about everything, and.. it's
totally cool.

374
00:41:49,881 --> 00:41:50,939
I feel good.

375
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:56,372
- Well i'm glad you feel that way buddy.
- Me too.

376
00:41:56,897 --> 00:42:00,646
You know, why don't you grab a seat,
tell minutes late never killed anyone right?

377
00:42:05,929 --> 00:42:10,159
They say she hasn't responded
to any calls or texts.

378
00:42:10,758 --> 00:42:14,753
That's correct. This is the last
place she was seen.

379
00:42:17,523 --> 00:42:19,335
It doesn't look like a robbery.

380
00:42:29,803 --> 00:42:30,924
Good God.

381
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,490
Have you talked to her daughter?

382
00:42:35,659 --> 00:42:39,374
She is a mess right now.
Scared shitless.

383
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,911
I couldn't get two words out of her.

384
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:44,591
What is that?

385
00:42:58,971 --> 00:43:03,915
So, i know that this is kinda strange, i'm
your aunt and i'm also your counselor

386
00:43:04,065 --> 00:43:07,597
but i'm the only one the district has
got so you are stuck with me.

387
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:14,471
So Brandon your mom tells me that you've been
having some issues lately about being adopted.

388
00:43:16,438 --> 00:43:20,445
- Nothing bad, only good ones.
- Really? How so?

389
00:43:21,707 --> 00:43:27,422
I've realized i'm special, because my real
parents aren't from a stupid place like here.

390
00:43:27,516 --> 00:43:30,601
Brandon you don't think of your
mom and dad as your real parents?

391
00:43:30,748 --> 00:43:35,696
I do, i just know i'm something else,
something superior.

392
00:43:40,403 --> 00:43:44,936
Brandon do you feel bad about
what you did to Caitlyn?

393
00:43:48,675 --> 00:43:55,608
You know, sometimes when bad things
happen to people it's for a good reason.

394
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:05,260
Brandon part of my job is to update the
school and update your mom on your progress

395
00:44:05,399 --> 00:44:08,969
and let them know if you are showing
any growth of remorse and i..

396
00:44:09,447 --> 00:44:14,069
i can't take it easy on you
because you are my family.

397
00:44:16,088 --> 00:44:18,784
Brandon i'm giving you an
opportunity to talk to me.

398
00:44:19,165 --> 00:44:22,999
I'm supposed to update the sheriff tomorrow
and i have to be honest with him.

399
00:44:35,527 --> 00:44:40,869
Yeah my buddy said the diner was just, was
just wrecked, and the waitress Erica was gone.

400
00:44:40,987 --> 00:44:42,353
It's been 24 hours.

401
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:45,031
Kyle do you think your son
could've done it?

402
00:44:46,215 --> 00:44:49,156
- Dude..
- What? He crushed her daughter's hand.

403
00:44:49,276 --> 00:44:50,633
This is not funny right now, ok?

404
00:44:51,393 --> 00:44:52,285
Ok i'm sorry.

405
00:44:52,471 --> 00:44:55,306
So, uh, what is gonna happen with all that.

406
00:44:55,412 --> 00:44:59,000
I don't know, he got suspended for a few
days and i'm sure i'm gonna get a call

407
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:03,491
from some lawyer telling me that my son's a
monster, wich, i don't know anymore, maybe he is.

408
00:45:03,647 --> 00:45:05,622
Yeah, they are all monsters,
i'm going home.

409
00:45:05,793 --> 00:45:08,616
- Come on! One more.
- One more come on!

410
00:45:08,768 --> 00:45:10,701
No, no, i gotta get home or
Merilee is gonna kill me.

411
00:45:10,789 --> 00:45:12,402
- Yeah, come on, i'll drive you.
- It's just a few miles down the road.

412
00:45:12,561 --> 00:45:16,085
- Yeah, hang on i'll drive.
- Mommy, i'm ok.

413
00:45:18,125 --> 00:45:19,205
Brandon.

414
00:45:22,689 --> 00:45:25,001
I'm home, i've got sesame chicken.

415
00:45:28,211 --> 00:45:29,055
Brandon?

416
00:45:58,453 --> 00:45:59,573
What?

417
00:46:19,291 --> 00:46:22,001
<i>Alert: motion backyard.</i>

418
00:46:23,929 --> 00:46:24,989
What?

419
00:46:46,767 --> 00:46:48,202
What the hell..

420
00:47:04,825 --> 00:47:09,312
- Ehy
- Brandon, Jesus, what are you doing here?

421
00:47:09,678 --> 00:47:14,350
I need to talk to you. I know it's late
but i promise i won't take long.

422
00:47:14,479 --> 00:47:15,518
Ok, fine.

423
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:20,127
Back in your office you mentioned something
about talking to the sheriff tomorrow?

424
00:47:20,638 --> 00:47:24,316
- That's right,
- Yeah, the thing is..

425
00:47:24,485 --> 00:47:30,375
that can't happen. Ever,
it's just not good for anyone.

426
00:47:30,525 --> 00:47:38,971
Not for me, not for my parents and it's
really, really not good for you. At all.

427
00:47:42,786 --> 00:47:46,945
Brandon, listen to me, ok?
I have to do my job..

428
00:47:47,166 --> 00:47:51,145
and to be honest you showing up at
my house this late, it's very inappropriate

429
00:47:51,286 --> 00:47:53,223
i'm gonna need you to go home now, ok?

430
00:47:55,089 --> 00:47:57,504
Ok. I'll walk back.

431
00:48:00,253 --> 00:48:04,092

Brandon?

440
00:50:49,738 --> 00:50:52,777
- What the fuck are you doing?!
- Aunt Merilee was helping me with my homework.

441
00:50:52,778 --> 00:50:55,384
No what the fuck are you doing

442
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:57,966

00:51:04,191 --> 00:51:06,912

446
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:12,730

Ok Merilee i know i'm leaving a lot

459
00:55:05,413 --> 00:55:09,293
- after ten now, and we still havent' seen him, so..
- Did she say anything to him at school?

460
00:55:09,447 --> 00:55:13,777
- Maybe he said something to you at school today, or
- If someone was gonna give him a ride home or som..

461
00:55:13,926 --> 00:55:20,169
Shut up! Where he wants to go
after school, i'm obviously rambling because i'm freaking out.

462
00:55:20,333 --> 00:55:24,032
So just please call me back, thank you.
Would you please stop?

463
00:55:24,178 --> 00:55:25,593
I didn't say anything.

464
00:55:27,624 --> 00:55:31,770
Oh my God, Baby!
Where have you been?

465
00:55:32,545 --> 00:55:34,945
Where were you, what happened
to your shirt?

466
00:55:35,352 --> 00:55:38,362
- I was playing soccer.
- You have been playing soccer this whole time?

467
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:45,757
Well, after school, Royce asked me if i wanted
to play, and as soon as the game started they..

468
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:53,971
they were tripping me, and pushing me to the ground,
and they were all laughing because my shirt got ripped.

469
00:55:54,798 --> 00:55:59,970
And i just decided to walk all the way home.
I know i should've called.

470
00:56:00,158 --> 00:56:03,810
- Yes.
- Actually i'm just really tired, i'm gonna go to bed.

471
00:56:04,328 --> 00:56:05,838
- Ok let me take this.
- No, no.

472
00:56:08,701 --> 00:56:11,652
Don't worry about it.
It's fine.

473
00:56:17,309 --> 00:56:19,089
I'll come up in a couple minutes.

474
00:56:22,668 --> 00:56:24,321
- He's lying.
- Yeah, obviously.

475
00:56:24,498 --> 00:56:26,147
I've told you if we don't do something
this is gonna get worst.

476
00:56:26,335 --> 00:56:27,860
- What the fuck do we do?
- I don't know.

477
00:56:28,015 --> 00:56:30,843
Maybe we need to talk to somebody
he needs a.. like a specialist.

478
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:32,774
- What? And say what to him?
- I don't know.

479
00:56:32,909 --> 00:56:36,833
'Hello this is our son we found him in a
fucking spaceship in the woods, now what?'

480
00:56:36,979 --> 00:56:39,691
No we should've done something
a long time ago, this is on us.

481
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:51,538
<i>Maybe this time we get lucky, like a baby?</i>

482
00:57:06,593 --> 00:57:08,201
<i>Just shut up and kiss me.</i>

483
00:57:24,426 --> 00:57:25,606
<i>What?</i>

484
00:57:28,899 --> 00:57:29,880
<i>Tori.</i>

485
00:57:32,395 --> 00:57:33,307
<i>Tori.</i>

486
00:57:47,781 --> 00:57:48,767
<i>Tori.</i>

487
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:58,168
<i>Tori?</i>

488
00:58:04,086 --> 00:58:07,199
<i>Ehy baby, what are you doing?</i>

489
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,282
<i>It's a boy.</i>

490
00:58:26,045 --> 00:58:29,855
<i>Oh we tried for so long to
have a baby and he's here.</i>

491
00:58:34,005 --> 00:58:36,800
<i>He's here. Our gift.</i>

492
00:58:58,708 --> 00:58:59,854
Hello?

493
00:59:00,981 --> 00:59:02,133
Ehy.. ehy.. uh?

494
00:59:06,062 --> 00:59:06,953
Meri.

495
00:59:14,985 --> 00:59:20,717
They won't let me see him, he has his..
They said that his face is..

496
00:59:20,957 --> 00:59:22,457
Did they know what happened?

497
00:59:22,971 --> 00:59:28,027
Uhm, they found him on route 18, they think
that he swerved to not not hit a deer and..

498
00:59:28,455 --> 00:59:33,392
and they are doing the toxicology to make sure
that he wasn't drinking, was he drinking?

499
00:59:34,299 --> 00:59:38,316
No he just had like two or three
drinks but he wasn't canned.

500
00:59:40,739 --> 00:59:42,079
How's Brandon?

501
00:59:42,361 --> 00:59:44,191
He is ok, we didn't tell him anything.

502
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:45,808
No but did he get home ok?

503
00:59:46,231 --> 00:59:49,371
- Yes he did.
- Ok thank God, thank God.

504
00:59:49,514 --> 00:59:54,099
He came over and i still remember when
he left, so i'm just glad that he is ok.

505
00:59:55,656 --> 00:59:57,053
He left you?

506
01:00:10,031 --> 01:00:11,265
Morning baby.

507
01:00:18,887 --> 01:00:21,439
Listen there's something that
we need to discuss with you..

508
01:00:21,779 --> 01:00:24,395
and it's probably gonna
be hard to hear..

509
01:00:26,608 --> 01:00:34,323
- last night your uncle Noah..
- He died last night.

510
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:37,899
Ok.

511
01:00:41,624 --> 01:00:47,372
Brandon do you understand?
Your uncle Noah passed away, he is gone.

512
01:00:51,266 --> 01:00:53,283
I feel like you want me to
cry or something.

513
01:00:53,676 --> 01:00:55,079
Do you wanna cry?

514
01:00:56,622 --> 01:00:59,748
Brandon we know that you
were at Merilee's last night.

515
01:01:03,836 --> 01:01:08,087
Honey, i'm your mom, i will
always defend you.

516
01:01:08,469 --> 01:01:13,045
But if you know something about what
happened to Noah, you need to tell us.

517
01:01:19,935 --> 01:01:21,472
I don't know what happened to him,

518
01:01:22,144 --> 01:01:25,992
but i would never hurt
uncle Noah, i love him.

519
01:01:27,446 --> 01:01:29,108
That is bullshit, he is fucking lying.

520
01:01:29,943 --> 01:01:32,029
- Kyle..
- Look we know you were there..

521
01:01:32,459 --> 01:01:34,119
what else are you lying to us about?

522
01:01:34,441 --> 01:01:35,156
Can you calm down?

523
01:01:35,402 --> 01:01:37,653
- Were you in Caitlyn's bedroom?
- He was camping with us.

524
01:01:37,831 --> 01:01:39,610
Where were you wednesday night
when Caitlyn's mom went missing?

525
01:01:39,763 --> 01:01:41,879
- This is not helping.
- He's lying to our fucking faces.

526
01:01:42,891 --> 01:01:44,131
I'm gonna go upstairs.

527
01:01:44,932 --> 01:01:47,808
No you are not. You are not going
anywhere until we get all this on the table.

528
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:49,888
- Kyle i will handle it!
- Right now, right now..

529
01:01:50,026 --> 01:01:53,724
Did you hurt Noah? What did you do to him?
He was my friend and you just fucking..

530
01:01:53,846 --> 01:01:54,900
Leave me alone!

531
01:02:01,910 --> 01:02:02,856
Brandon..

532
01:02:06,787 --> 01:02:09,787
You need to go to your room.
Just go to your room.

533
01:02:10,388 --> 01:02:11,306
Are you alright?

534
01:02:14,641 --> 01:02:15,633
Baby?

535
01:02:16,347 --> 01:02:18,309
He's hiding that fucking
shirt for some reason.

536
01:02:19,104 --> 01:02:19,931
Honey..

537
01:02:58,296 --> 01:02:59,414
Shit.

538
01:03:05,232 --> 01:03:06,170
Dad?

539
01:03:08,586 --> 01:03:13,233
Ehy bud. I wanted to apologize.

540
01:03:15,754 --> 01:03:21,948
We've been going through a lot lately and..
i shouldn't have said what i said to you.

541
01:03:23,544 --> 01:03:24,499
Ok.

542
01:03:26,464 --> 01:03:28,102
- Come here, come here.
- What? what?

543
01:03:30,857 --> 01:03:33,014
- It's right there.
- That could be anything.

544
01:03:33,156 --> 01:03:36,709
No, no, no that is why he was hiding this
from us last night, that is Noah's blood.

545
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:38,270
How?

546
01:03:38,444 --> 01:03:42,178
How could Brandon have killed Noah and
then made it look like a car accident.

547
01:03:42,293 --> 01:03:43,449
Who knows what kind of
weird shit he could do.

548
01:03:43,572 --> 01:03:49,085
Noah was drunk and wrecked the car
because you let him drive..

549
01:03:49,239 --> 01:03:50,726
- No, no, no, that is not..
- And now you..

550
01:03:50,921 --> 01:03:54,183
are trying to take out your guilt on
our 12 years old son?

551
01:03:54,364 --> 01:03:58,935
- Babe..
- You are making a hard situation, impossible.

552
01:03:59,073 --> 01:04:01,363
Babe we've gotta do something..

553
01:04:01,803 --> 01:04:06,189
If we don't more people are gonna get hurt,
or people will die, you gotta be with me on this.

554
01:04:06,418 --> 01:04:08,801
I will never turn against our son.

555
01:04:08,929 --> 01:04:12,699
He is not our son! He is some thing
we found in the woods.

556
01:04:12,876 --> 01:04:15,053
How fucking dare you
say that to me?

557
01:04:15,752 --> 01:04:17,974
How dare you fucking say that to me!

558
01:04:18,112 --> 01:04:20,234
Babe come on, he is killing us!

559
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:24,839
<i>We now turn to more sombre news tonight
as authorities are reaching out to the public..</i>

Are you ok?

563
01:06:01,114 --> 01:06:07,166
Honey, i might take him away
this weekend, just the two of us.

564
01:06:08,932 --> 01:06:16,614
Take him out to Drivewood, be
his dad, let him know i love him.

565
01:06:35,461 --> 01:06:36,666
Ehy don't forget these.

566
01:06:38,059 --> 01:06:40,282
- Just wear them for me.
- Ok.

567
01:06:49,049 --> 01:06:50,972
You'll always be my baby boy.

568
01:06:54,488 --> 01:06:56,633
Oh my God you are getting so tall.

569
01:06:58,365 --> 01:06:59,912
Go have fun with your dad, ok?

570
01:07:02,228 --> 01:07:03,244
Alright..

571
01:07:06,276 --> 01:07:07,546
- Seatbelt.
- Alright.

572
01:07:11,517 --> 01:07:12,852
See you sunday.

573
01:08:15,898 --> 01:08:17,996
- Good afternoon Tori.
- Ehy.

574
01:08:20,552 --> 01:08:22,022
Your boy around by chance?

575
01:08:23,127 --> 01:08:24,960
Brandon went hunting with his dad.

576
01:08:25,545 --> 01:08:26,856
Is something wrong?

577
01:08:27,175 --> 01:08:29,802
Maybe you can answer a question for me.

578
01:08:31,488 --> 01:08:33,143
Does this look familiar to you?

579
01:08:34,412 --> 01:08:39,977
Some kind of signature left
at spot where Noad died.

580
01:08:40,088 --> 01:08:41,109
No.

581
01:08:42,511 --> 01:08:48,897
That doesn't look like a..
BB maybe? As in Brandon Breyer?

582
01:08:50,114 --> 01:08:51,369
I don't see it.

583
01:08:54,795 --> 01:08:56,337
Would you mind if i come in,
take a look around?

584
01:08:56,498 --> 01:08:59,522
I do mind, i think actually
you should go.

585
01:09:00,524 --> 01:09:05,089
Alright, but you know i'll be back.

586
01:09:24,458 --> 01:09:25,727
These are deer tracks.

587
01:09:41,884 --> 01:09:43,778
Looks like there's more
than one set of tracks.

588
01:10:58,591 --> 01:10:59,882
Brandon?

589
01:11:01,129 --> 01:11:02,178
Oh man.

590
01:11:34,767 --> 01:11:36,510

01:11:42,808 --> 01:11:45,766
Brandon, please, stop, don't hurt me ok?

01:11:48,204 --> 01:11:49,874
Don't, don't i'm sorry.

01:12:15,089 --> 01:12:22,946
Brandon, he killed Noah, and.. Kyle?

598
01:12:37,794 --> 01:12:38,931

Gone where?

600
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:45,971

are a blessing that fell to this earth.

When we found you..

644
01:21:21,638 --> 01:21:27,945
you were so tiny and fragile, and all
we could do was keep you safe..

645
01:21:29,281 --> 01:21:37,503
whatever you've done, i know
there is good inside you.
