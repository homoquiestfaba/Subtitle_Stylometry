SHABBAT DINNER

00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,400
October 1, 1999
SHABBAT DINNER

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,400
October 1, 1999
Just another SHABBAT DINNER

4
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,880
William get the door!

5
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,060
ARNOLD! They're here!

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,900
Shit.

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,580
You must be William! I'm Susan,
this is David, and this is our son, Virgo.

8
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,750
- Nice to meet you.
- Susan! David!

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,000
Come in.

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,980
So tell me, Susan, when is he, she..?

11
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:49,700
A girl.

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,800
When is she due?
You look like you're about to pop!

13
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:01,530
Oh and by the way,
thank you SO much for supporting the seminary.

14
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,130
David and I really appreciate it.

15
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:08,960
Well of course! Most of our giving
is to Jewish causes, it's so important.

16
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,050
William, Mr. Bernstein Cohen
is studying now to be a Rabbi.

17
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,090
That was the fundraiser daddy and I went to last week.

18
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,710
And I said Susan, since you're so good
at making invitations, why don't you help out.

19
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,500
And they came out well, very well.

20
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,550
I think.

21
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,420
Susan, David, all the way from Queens!

22
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,340
What's Virgo mean?

23
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,420
It means I'm adventurous. I was born in September.

24
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,750
Virgo just had his birthday last week.

25
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,340
Happy birthday little guy!

26
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,210
They're gonna make him captain of the team.

27
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:47,460
He didn't even like Lacrosse when he started,
but I said to him

28
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,710
buck up kid, you do what you gotta
do to get into college.

29
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,300
It's a ridiculous game, isn't it?

30
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,630
Who can take more AP and honors classes, do more sports...

31
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,920
- They're gonna make him editor of his paper in a few years.
- You're embarrassing him!

32
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,630
Virgo loves to play soccer.

33
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,840
Every day he and his friends play,

34
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,250
and we have this beautiful field right in Forest Hills.

35
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:12,500
It's vacant, so we were worried at first
about vagrants or rusty nails.

36
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,600
But Virgo just loves his soccer..

37
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:23,630
- Can we be excused?
- Yeah, sure, why don't you go show Virgo your room?

38
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,630
Wanna come see my room?

39
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,500
I actually hate Lacrosse.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,880
Soccer's cool, though.

41
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,500
Do you have any video games?

42
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,000
No, I'm not allowed to.
My mom doesn't even let me watch TV.

43
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,050
- It's pretty lame.
- Yeah, that's pretty lame.

44
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,030
Wanna see my morse code machine?

45
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,150
Sure.

46
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:07,300
It's for people to talk to each other,
like captains of ships.

47
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,590
I made it in my science afterschool program.

48
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,880
What's that?

49
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,800
SOS. It means save our ship.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,090
Here, you try.

51
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,670
That's an E.

52
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,920
That's a T.

53
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,920
How do you make a V?

54
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,800
See..

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,630
You have a girlfriend?

56
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,920
Naw, I used to. A few years ago.

57
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,750
- Her name was Dee.
- Cool

58
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:02,170
I don't now though.
There are some girls I like though.

59
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,550
Cool.

60
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,460
Do you?

61
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,960
I don't want to talk about it.

62
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,420
- What do you mean?
- Nothin'.

63
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:15,210
- It's, like...
- What?

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,800
Just forget about it.

65
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,670
Okay.

66
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,710
I can keep a secret.

67
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,250
Promise you won't be upset.

68
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,750
Yeah, sure.

69
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,340
Well, the thing is,

70
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,880
I'm..

71
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,130
- I'm gay.
- What?
- Nothing.

72
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,460
- Nothing, just, you know What, never mind.
- What did you just say?

73
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,210
Didn't you hear what I just said?

74
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,960
Is it true?

75
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,550
Wow, okay..

76
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:11,880
Well that's cool, I mean,
I never met a gay guy before.

77
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,880
Have you told anyone else?

78
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,960
Yeah, like, a friend of mine, a month ago.

79
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,960
Why did you tell me?

80
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:30,550
It kind of felt good to say it,
like I could kinda be myself.

81
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,750
Was your friend okay with it?

82
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,710
Yeah, he was okay with it,

83
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:40,000
But my other friends say stuff that make me think they wouldn’t be okay with it.

84
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,920
But this guy…

85
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,500
we hooked up.

86
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,670
- You hooked up with a guy?
- Yeah.

87
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:55,250
What did you...do?

88
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,250
Stuff.

89
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,960
- Have you told your parents?
- Yeah.

90
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,000
- When?
- Yesterday.

91
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,250
Wow.

92
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,300
What did they say?

93
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,340
They were okay with it. My mom cried, but she's pretty crazy.

94
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,630
My dad said that god creates everyone equally.

95
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:25,590
Wow. Parents suck.

96
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,700
But it's cool that you're gay.

97
00:06:28,901 --> 00:06:29,935
I mean... not...

98
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,420
...but it's cool that you have the balls to say it.

99
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:37,820
I mean, I'm not, but I don't think
I'd have the balls to say it if I was.

100
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,780
I mean, everyone has still been very friendly.

101
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,680
So does Virgo have a girlfriend?

102
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:49,710
No, no, Virgo doesn't have a .. girlfriend right now.
We don't really ask him about that s--

103
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:53,960
William is a serial dater. He actually just broke up with his girlfriend.

104
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,750
Wasn't Jewish.

105
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,130
But surely she wouldn't have to be Jewish?

106
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,750
Oh, Jesus.

107
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:05,340
No I wouldn't let my kid marry a goy.

108
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:11,420
Our people have been persecuted for centuries.
We finally have a state of Israel.

109
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,800
- If we intermarried there would be none of us left.
- Well I think..

110
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,210
...I think...

111
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,550
You know what, nothing, nevermind.

112
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:21,550
- What?
- Susan--

113
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,920
- I think that's racist.
- Who wants dessert?

114
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,210
- You think it's racist to keep kosher?
- Now really, Susan..

115
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,550
- You're a rabbi, right?
- Studying to be--

116
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:33,000
So you know, marrying Jewish is one of the rules,
just like keeping kosher,

117
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,130
which I do because I'm a good jew.

118
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:42,340
Well, I would say that being a good jew
is about respect and tolerance.

119
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,210
For some people it's more spiritual.

120
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:48,170
You mean some people don't respect the law. I'm a lawyer--

121
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,250
- Arnold.
- I deal with rules.

122
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:54,050
A religion is a set of rules to live by.
You don't get to pick--

123
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:58,130
So I got this new ice cream.
Beth Horowitz told me about it.

124
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,940
- I'm sorry, never mind.
- Gluten free, dairy free, soy free…

125
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,900
God knows what is IN this ice cream! Who wants to try?

126
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,800
- I'll have a taste.
- Perfect.

127
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,710
I will help!

128
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,960
We can play trivia.

129
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,700
Okay.

130
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,750
Can I ask you a question?

131
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,760
Sure.

132
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:38,829
How did you know you were gay?

133
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:43,119
I don't know.

134
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,950
I just knew.

135
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,370
I mean, you don't always know.

136
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:53,000
I looked at guys and thought I was interested. I kissed girls and wasn't.

137
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,080
It's all on a spectrum, you know?

138
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,330
Yeah.

139
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:03,790
I mean, haven't you ever looked at a guy
and thought about him sexually?

140
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:07,540
Yeah, a few times.

141
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,430
What was it like to kiss a guy?

142
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,330
It was like kissing a girl,

143
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,140
except more...

144
00:09:19,545 --> 00:09:21,545
...more manly.

145
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,160
What did you do?

146
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,300
Just, stuff.

147
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,830
Can I ask you something?

148
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:38,750
Yeah. Okay.

149
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,410
Do you want to hook up?

150
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,700
Wow.

151
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,200
Dude, you've got balls to ask that.

152
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,350
What if I kicked your ass?

153
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:58,550
I can't. I'm sorry.

154
00:09:59,185 --> 00:10:02,085
Oh, okay, um..

155
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,700
I shouldn't have asked that.

156
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,750
I'm not gay.

157
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,410
No, it's okay...

158
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,950
Do you wanna play trivia?

159
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,560
That was so cool.

160
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,540
Yeah, okay.

161
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,240
- You're shaking.
- So are you.

162
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,700
Wait, wait--

163
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,800
You will not believe what happened to me yesterday!

164
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:37,510
I am outside of H&H, and this woman comes up to me on the street,

165
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:40,720
and she says what a beautiful burka.

166
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,720
I didn't know that your people could wear such bright colors.

167
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,880
- And then you said..
- I said It's not a burka it's a poncho!

168
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,790
Your son seems like a nice boy.

169
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,950
Maybe he'll rub off on William.

170
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
This is so cool.

171
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:22,010
- Well..
- Rebecca, this was just lovely.

172
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,130
Yes.

173
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,250
William!

174
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,050
- Virgo!
- Shiiit!

175
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,650
Look man I'm not--

176
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,130

William!

00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,300
We'll have to have you over soon. Say, in three weeks?

00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,750
I think we're free.

182
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:09,960
We'll double check our calendar,
but I think that's good.

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,620
