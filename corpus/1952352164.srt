1
00:02:31,308 --> 00:02:35,142
Don't you go and dare not
to swallow, you hear me?

2
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:40,766
Swallow it!

3
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:48,179
That's it. Here's some more.
Stop it!

4
00:02:48,348 --> 00:02:51,545
You stop it and do what I say!

5
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:56,418
<i>Stop it! Stop it!!!</i>
Cancer, June 21...

6
00:02:56,588 --> 00:02:59,307
to July 20.

7
00:02:59,668 --> 00:03:04,337
Now... is the time...
for change...

8
00:03:04,508 --> 00:03:08,786
That make you happy now?
Yeah, yeah! Plunge it all in there!

9
00:03:08,948 --> 00:03:10,745
Now, how does make you feel, huh?

10
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:18,178
... little tasks you've been
putting off...

11
00:03:18,348 --> 00:03:20,339
<i>Stop it!!!</i>
can... now... be...

12
00:03:20,508 --> 00:03:23,818
Does that make you happy?
Is that what you want?

13
00:03:23,988 --> 00:03:29,108
<i>Stop it!!! Stop it!!!</i>
All the... little tasks...

14
00:03:29,268 --> 00:03:32,522
... you have been putting off
can now...

15
00:03:33,522 --> 00:03:36,422
be... moved...
<i>Is that what you want?! Stop it!!</i>

16
00:03:36,588 --> 00:03:39,365
<i>Stop it!!</i>
to the front... burner.

17
00:04:27,347 --> 00:04:28,547
Wes?

18
00:04:35,328 --> 00:04:37,325
You promised me.

19
00:04:39,408 --> 00:04:40,821
Remember?

20
00:04:42,468 --> 00:04:46,738
If she lived past the age of 12,
we could get her some help?

21
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,100
Billy.

22
00:05:26,188 --> 00:05:30,340
- Billy, get up!
- Goddamit! Why did you do that for?

23
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,222
He's gonna kill me, you know that?
I'm as good as dead.

24
00:05:38,388 --> 00:05:42,276
Tell him you don't know where we're at.
You woke up and we were both gone.

25
00:05:42,348 --> 00:05:46,300
How're you supposed to've got anywhere?
You can't even do anything for yourself.

26
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:49,018
I don't know,
You have to think of an excuse.

27
00:05:49,518 --> 00:05:52,018
What are you gonna live on?

28
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:20,879
<i>Department Welfare...</i>

29
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:23,562
Uh, I'm going to have to
call you back.

30
00:06:23,628 --> 00:06:25,027
Is this were you handle the blind?

31
00:06:25,127 --> 00:06:29,127
No, ma'am, this is Social Services.
Now, if you just go around back...

32
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:33,345
Um, could you lead me there?
I got cataracts...

33
00:06:33,508 --> 00:06:37,940
and the woman told me on the phone
I could come here and get benefits.

34
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,950
Who's that with you?

35
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,845
Uh, that's Katie, my daughter.

36
00:06:43,808 --> 00:06:45,364
How old are you, Katie?

37
00:06:45,514 --> 00:06:47,487
She'll be 14 in April.

38
00:07:00,108 --> 00:07:03,145
<i>The parents of a 13-year-old girl
are free on bail tonight...</i>

39
00:07:03,308 --> 00:07:05,384
<i>facing charges for what
authorities are calling...</i>

40
00:07:05,484 --> 00:07:07,984
<i>the worst case
of child abuse they've ever s-</i>

41
00:07:08,148 --> 00:07:12,266
<i>The girl, currently being treated for
malnutrition at Children's Hospital...</i>

42
00:07:12,428 --> 00:07:16,307
<i>was being held captive by her
parents, from the age of 1 to 13.</i>

43
00:07:16,468 --> 00:07:20,444
<i>Early reports indicate the child
never even learned to speak...</i>

44
00:07:20,508 --> 00:07:23,981
<i>leading some to tag her
a so-called "wild child".</i>

45
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:41,855
Why did you do it?

46
00:07:41,955 --> 00:07:44,555
Mrs. Standon is an innocent victim
of her domineering husband.

47
00:07:44,605 --> 00:07:46,618
That's the only comment we have
to make at this time. Thank you.

48
00:07:46,668 --> 00:07:50,865
What happened to the little girl?
You know what happened to her?

49
00:08:05,428 --> 00:08:09,398
Where is the house where the people
tied their little girl to the toilet?

50
00:08:50,288 --> 00:08:52,226
All rise!

51
00:09:01,988 --> 00:09:03,706
Be seated.

52
00:09:29,988 --> 00:09:31,539
State vs. Standon.

53
00:09:31,789 --> 00:09:34,402
You're charged with willful abuse
and neglect of a minor...

54
00:09:34,502 --> 00:09:36,602
placed in your custody.
How do you plead?

55
00:09:44,325 --> 00:09:45,625
Louise.

56
00:09:48,348 --> 00:09:51,625
I plead not guilty. I'm sorry...

57
00:10:54,188 --> 00:10:57,737
<i>She's beautiful.
I was expecting...</i>

58
00:10:59,108 --> 00:11:01,542
<i>I-I don't know what
I was expecting...</i>

59
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:05,004
<i>Stan claims he's heard her use
a few words for colours and...</i>

60
00:11:05,104 --> 00:11:07,004
<i>"momma" and "stop it".</i>

61
00:11:07,168 --> 00:11:09,107
<i>I heard her use those myself.</i>

62
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:12,765
<i>We gather she's learned them before
she was locked away, but so far...</i>

63
00:11:12,865 --> 00:11:15,265
<i>she doesn't seem to have
picked up any new ones.</i>

64
00:11:15,368 --> 00:11:20,665
<i>She's almost fourteen, right?
So, the "critical period" has passed.</i>

65
00:11:20,828 --> 00:11:22,181
<i>I beg your pardon?</i>

66
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,344
<i>Lenneberg's hypothesis, if a child
doesn't acquire a language...</i>

67
00:11:25,408 --> 00:11:28,666
<i>by the time it reaches puberty,
it never will.</i>

68
00:11:30,108 --> 00:11:33,464
<i>Well, she hasn't officially
crossed that line yet, so...</i>

69
00:11:33,628 --> 00:11:38,019
<i>even if this theory is correct,
then, she still has a little time.</i>

70
00:11:38,188 --> 00:11:41,544
Now, listen, I don't want you to just
dive in there and start testing.

71
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:44,662
I want you to spend this next
few weeks getting to know her...

72
00:11:44,762 --> 00:11:46,962
build up her confidence and trust.

73
00:11:47,028 --> 00:11:51,180
Unless, of course, uh,
you'd like to back out right now.

74
00:11:53,108 --> 00:11:56,578
You like the hair?
Katie, what colour is that?

75
00:11:57,728 --> 00:12:01,687
Katie? Do you know what colour that is?

76
00:12:01,748 --> 00:12:05,821
<i>That's red. Your hair is brown,
mine is grey...</i>

77
00:12:05,988 --> 00:12:10,823
Katie? Do you remember me?
I'm doctor Glazer.

78
00:12:10,988 --> 00:12:17,666
I brought a friend of mine
with me today. Her name is Sandra.

79
00:13:09,308 --> 00:13:12,061
So, did you meet
the famous "wild child"?

80
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:15,561
And?

81
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,758
Katie, rise and shine.

82
00:13:47,468 --> 00:13:51,177
- You remember Miss Tannen, don't you?
- Good morning, Katie.

83
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,184
Katie, I wanna show you
something. Okay?

84
00:14:03,988 --> 00:14:06,977
Do you think you can do that? Here.

85
00:14:52,148 --> 00:14:57,063
Uh, Katie. Here, watch me.
Okay? Right?

86
00:14:58,888 --> 00:15:00,441
See?

87
00:15:04,108 --> 00:15:07,065
Apparently, she was never given
enough time to chew her food...

88
00:15:07,165 --> 00:15:10,865
so she waits for it
to break down in her mouth.

89
00:15:12,308 --> 00:15:16,586
How are you doing, sugarpie?
I got a present for you.

90
00:15:17,048 --> 00:15:19,282
How did you know she wanted that?

91
00:15:19,448 --> 00:15:22,281
- She told me.
- She did?

92
00:15:22,448 --> 00:15:26,202
Well, she didn't use no words,
but she told me just the same.

93
00:15:36,188 --> 00:15:40,385
- How many balloons do you have here?
- Four.

94
00:15:40,868 --> 00:15:43,263
What about you, Leslie?
How many balloons do you have?

95
00:15:43,323 --> 00:15:44,863
Three?

96
00:15:45,508 --> 00:15:48,799
I think you might wanna take
another look at those balloons.

97
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:51,899
Is it three or is it actually two?

98
00:15:56,628 --> 00:16:01,418
Well, thanks to Katie,
it's now definitely three.

99
00:16:05,148 --> 00:16:07,059
Very good!

100
00:16:20,988 --> 00:16:22,741
Try again.

101
00:16:33,341 --> 00:16:35,141
Judy. Hi.

102
00:16:36,348 --> 00:16:40,546
We were never formally introduced.
I'm... Sandra Tannen.

103
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,983
I know who you are.

104
00:16:43,148 --> 00:16:45,145
Aw, you know? It's so funny!

105
00:16:45,245 --> 00:16:49,245
This hospital has gone into
such lags to secure a grant.

106
00:16:49,246 --> 00:16:54,084
With the money they got, they could
bring in Noam Chomsky himself.

107
00:16:54,148 --> 00:16:56,339
Instead, they run across town
to UCLA and...

108
00:16:56,739 --> 00:16:59,639
find some 1st-year-graduate student.

109
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,477
Well, that's exactly what they wanted.

110
00:17:01,577 --> 00:17:04,977
I don't have any time constraints
or family obligations.

111
00:17:05,248 --> 00:17:07,103
No experience.

112
00:17:07,268 --> 00:17:11,138
Do you actually think you're qualified
to teach this child how to talk?

113
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,006
I'm not here to teach her how to talk.
I'm here to document...

114
00:17:13,106 --> 00:17:15,106
the way she goes about
acquiring language.

115
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:17,907
There's a... huge difference.

116
00:17:18,068 --> 00:17:21,981
Well, you certainly
gonna have a lot to document.

117
00:17:22,148 --> 00:17:23,547
This girl...

118
00:17:25,047 --> 00:17:30,347
This girl is gonna make me famous.
I'm gonna be the next Annie Sullivan.

119
00:17:36,448 --> 00:17:40,202
- She really said that?
- I cross my heart and hope to die.

120
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:43,041
Annie Sullivan was the one
who taught Helen Keller, right?

121
00:17:43,101 --> 00:17:44,541
That's the one.

122
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:49,045
I mean, alright, she's a very
talented teacher, I agree, but...

123
00:17:49,108 --> 00:17:53,083
to state her ambitions,
in such overt terms?

124
00:17:53,148 --> 00:17:56,008
Look, I know that Judy's
a little eccentric but...

125
00:17:56,058 --> 00:17:58,158
like I say, she's very good
at what she does...

126
00:17:58,228 --> 00:18:00,217
and she's essentially well-meaning.

127
00:18:01,268 --> 00:18:03,179
I hope you're right.

128
00:18:08,828 --> 00:18:13,344
- Would you like more coffee, Mrs. Standon?
- Don't know if I would.

129
00:18:17,126 --> 00:18:18,326
Katie...

130
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:22,345
Did I tell you your brother moved away?

131
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:29,327
I don't know where exactly.
I don't know if he told me.

132
00:18:29,388 --> 00:18:32,141
- Can I speak to you for a second?
- Yeah, sure.

133
00:18:32,308 --> 00:18:36,823
Please, will you excuse us
for a minute? Thank you.

134
00:18:40,068 --> 00:18:44,903
So, I'm assuming- since nobody
told me she was gonna be here today...

135
00:18:45,068 --> 00:18:48,022
it's not a very good idea
to ask her any questions, right?

136
00:18:48,122 --> 00:18:50,722
I think that's probably
a wise assessment.

137
00:18:51,888 --> 00:18:54,167
I hope you can appreciate
my sense of frustration.

138
00:18:54,227 --> 00:18:57,067
We know so little
about Katie's past.

139
00:18:57,228 --> 00:19:00,479
And this woman's in a position
to tell us so much.

140
00:19:00,648 --> 00:19:04,960
The last time she talked,
she wound up in jail. Don't forget.

141
00:19:05,028 --> 00:19:08,464
The court has decided that
she's a victim, too.

142
00:19:08,628 --> 00:19:10,703
Don't you wanna know why?

143
00:19:10,803 --> 00:19:14,703
I'm not even talking as a scientist,
I'm talking as a human being.

144
00:19:14,868 --> 00:19:18,061
I wanna know how another
human being was subjected...

145
00:19:18,195 --> 00:19:21,095
- to this kind of torture.
- You just have to be patient.

146
00:19:21,228 --> 00:19:23,950
Eventually, there'll be some answers.
There's been a suggestion...

147
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
at the hospital's donated services
to remove her cataracts.

148
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,599
Kind of a...

149
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,441
- Good will gesture.
- That's right.

150
00:19:31,508 --> 00:19:34,818
I still think it's vital that Katie
continues to see her mother.

151
00:19:34,988 --> 00:19:38,200
She's the only link to the past
that child has got.

152
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:46,381
Doesn't it feel great to get out
of the hospital for a while?

153
00:19:52,981 --> 00:19:54,081
Oh, my God.

154
00:19:54,108 --> 00:19:56,066
What's wrong?

155
00:20:02,528 --> 00:20:04,662
She's masturbating.

156
00:20:05,762 --> 00:20:08,162
Aw... Jesus.

157
00:20:23,948 --> 00:20:25,745
I got it.

158
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:32,786
- What you got there, Katie?
- Green.

159
00:20:32,948 --> 00:20:38,386
Yes, that's green! This is green.
These are peas.

160
00:20:38,548 --> 00:20:40,982
- Peas.
- Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah!

161
00:20:41,148 --> 00:20:43,708
- Oh, my God!
- That's right, peas.

162
00:20:44,748 --> 00:20:48,338
- And that is corn.
- Corn.

163
00:20:53,908 --> 00:20:57,145
- Hey... easy... Uh...
- Katie! Katie, come here!

164
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:04,984
There's something I wanna show you!
That man doesn't want to be bothered.

165
00:21:05,148 --> 00:21:09,539
- Bother?
- Bothered.

166
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:11,739
I'm sorry...

167
00:22:13,988 --> 00:22:18,626
Number at the toy store.
Katie's looking at these beach pails.

168
00:22:18,826 --> 00:22:21,026
- She just loves anything plastic.
- Right.

169
00:22:21,088 --> 00:22:23,760
So finally, Stan and I decided
we're gonna buy her one.

170
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:27,060
And the cashier says to us:
"Are you sure she wants another one?"

171
00:22:27,128 --> 00:22:29,585
We said: "What do you mean?"
And she says...

172
00:22:29,685 --> 00:22:32,485
"Well, that woman who just left
just bought her one. "

173
00:22:32,626 --> 00:22:34,526
- Wow! - Yeah, but that's not
what's really interesting.

174
00:22:34,676 --> 00:22:38,178
What's really interesting is that Stan
and I were with her the whole time...

175
00:22:38,228 --> 00:22:41,342
and she never said one word
to that woman, or to anyone else.

176
00:22:41,508 --> 00:22:43,826
- Did you pick the phone bill, by the way?
- I mean...

177
00:22:43,888 --> 00:22:45,985
I guess it's not that surprising.

178
00:22:46,248 --> 00:22:49,098
She's been cut off
from language, so naturally...

179
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:52,598
she's developed this whole
other way of communicating but...

180
00:22:52,668 --> 00:22:54,051
it's so fascinating...

181
00:22:54,101 --> 00:22:57,339
it's so fascinating to see
the effect she has on people.

182
00:22:57,439 --> 00:22:58,839
Right.

183
00:23:04,608 --> 00:23:06,407
What are these?

184
00:23:07,668 --> 00:23:10,218
- Eye.
- That's great!

185
00:23:13,508 --> 00:23:17,183
And you have eyes, right?
Where are your eyes?

186
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:21,884
No, those are Miss Bingham's eyes.
Where are your eyes?

187
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:29,082
Look at that.
It's just like she's blind.

188
00:23:29,788 --> 00:23:33,064
Even the way she walks
has a blindism to it.

189
00:23:33,228 --> 00:23:36,100
It's like she's testing out
the ground beneath her feet...

190
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:38,718
'cause she doesn't even trust her eyes.

191
00:24:09,588 --> 00:24:14,378
Now, in Arctica, that's a gold mine for
studying effects of social isolation.

192
00:24:14,548 --> 00:24:16,427
I spent three whole summers there.

193
00:24:16,477 --> 00:24:18,824
In fact, I even got a mountain
named after me.

194
00:24:19,388 --> 00:24:21,299
I think she's waking up.

195
00:24:23,348 --> 00:24:25,406
Look at her. She's scared to death!

196
00:24:25,956 --> 00:24:28,256
- Can I go in there for a few minutes?
- Don't worry. She'll be back...

197
00:24:28,306 --> 00:24:29,606
to sleep in no time.

198
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:32,698
Now, when you isolate somebody...

199
00:24:33,098 --> 00:24:36,398
you start to see the effects
in as little as 15 minutes.

200
00:24:36,468 --> 00:24:39,446
I imagine what this little girl
has been through.

201
00:24:39,546 --> 00:24:43,146
We're gonna find some
pretty severe abnormalities.

202
00:24:43,308 --> 00:24:44,663
Where do you think you're going?

203
00:24:44,713 --> 00:24:47,213
I'm just gonna go and say hello
just so she knows I'm close by.

204
00:24:47,363 --> 00:24:48,663
Sandra...

205
00:24:49,668 --> 00:24:52,262
Pepsi-generation.

206
00:24:54,762 --> 00:24:57,662
Hey, Katie... hi.

207
00:24:58,868 --> 00:25:03,180
No, no, you can't do that. I know,
it's so uncomfortable. Oh, no.

208
00:25:06,668 --> 00:25:11,947
No, sweetie, lie down. No, it's okay.
How about I sing you a song, huh?

209
00:25:12,947 --> 00:25:15,847
<i>Hush little baby, don't say a word...</i>

210
00:25:15,934 --> 00:25:18,647
<i>momma's gonna buy you a mockingbird.</i>

211
00:25:18,947 --> 00:25:21,652
<i>And if that mockingbird don't sing...</i>

212
00:25:21,802 --> 00:25:24,747
<i>momma's gonna buy you a diamond ring.</i>

213
00:25:24,808 --> 00:25:26,287
It's good.

214
00:25:44,268 --> 00:25:46,941
Sandra silly.

215
00:25:47,988 --> 00:25:50,741
Now this is very interesting.

216
00:25:51,108 --> 00:25:52,799
You see these spindles here?

217
00:25:52,899 --> 00:25:55,699
See how they all batch up
together like that?

218
00:25:55,768 --> 00:25:59,317
That's generally a sign
of retardation from birth.

219
00:26:05,668 --> 00:26:07,199
So she said "Sandra silly", huh?

220
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:09,118
- Mm-hmm, that's what she said.
- Amazing.

221
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:10,998
It's the first time
she called me by name.

222
00:26:11,068 --> 00:26:14,383
Or put two words together,
for that matter. Come here, Katie!

223
00:26:14,548 --> 00:26:16,646
Well, we all know there's been
some progress but...

224
00:26:16,746 --> 00:26:19,346
that doesn't necessarily mean
Lacey's wrong.

225
00:26:19,408 --> 00:26:22,047
It doesn't mean he's right either.
It's just one study.

226
00:26:22,108 --> 00:26:25,066
Lacey admitted himself, you find
the exact same sleep spindles...

227
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,166
in infant boys who've
just been circumcised.

228
00:26:27,228 --> 00:26:28,388
And then, don't forget...

229
00:26:28,438 --> 00:26:31,827
Katie started speaking at 16 months,
which is not the case...

230
00:26:31,927 --> 00:26:33,727
with retarded children.

231
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:37,683
<i>- Katie, hey, Katie! Come here!
<i>- Look, I'm not trying to be biased.

232
00:26:37,783 --> 00:26:42,283
I'm prepared to follow the facts
wherever they might lead.

233
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,183
No! Katie! Don't do that!!

234
00:27:02,108 --> 00:27:04,827
- Will you please call off your dog?
- Please!

235
00:27:18,188 --> 00:27:21,140
- Pail. My pail.
- Yes, I know.

236
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:25,805
You like pails. Pail. Yes, I know.

237
00:27:25,868 --> 00:27:29,258
- Like bucket.
- Yes, and you like buckets, too.

238
00:27:29,428 --> 00:27:34,548
But, why is this one a pail
and this one a bucket?

239
00:27:34,708 --> 00:27:36,539
They look the same to me.

240
00:27:36,708 --> 00:27:40,239
Well, making more of our little
research notes, I see?

241
00:27:41,508 --> 00:27:44,826
Katie, how would you like
to spend the night at my house?

242
00:27:44,876 --> 00:27:47,526
- I beg your pardon?
- Dr. Glazer said it was fine.

243
00:27:47,588 --> 00:27:51,042
This child is not simply
some tool of science, you know.

244
00:27:51,108 --> 00:27:54,521
It's about time she spends
some time in a normal home.

245
00:27:54,621 --> 00:27:59,144
A norm-? Do I need to remind you
of certain comments you've made?

246
00:28:01,828 --> 00:28:04,217
And Miss Bingham likes Katie, too.

247
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:08,617
Miss Bingham likes Katie more than
anybody in the whole world.

248
00:28:24,268 --> 00:28:25,603
Hello?

249
00:28:26,553 --> 00:28:28,586
Well, she's still asleep.

250
00:28:30,228 --> 00:28:33,042
Sure, I can give her a message.

251
00:28:35,228 --> 00:28:37,025
What, are you kidding me?

252
00:28:38,068 --> 00:28:39,786
Who is it, Rob?

253
00:28:41,228 --> 00:28:45,543
Katie is being quarantined
over at Judy Bingham's house.

254
00:28:49,508 --> 00:28:51,536
Judy's contracted rubella.

255
00:28:51,537 --> 00:28:54,536
Katie's been staying over at her house,
so, she's been exposed too.

256
00:28:54,708 --> 00:28:58,587
We can not risk infecting the rest
of the children at the hospital.

257
00:28:58,748 --> 00:29:00,998
I don't believe it...
I don't believe this!

258
00:29:01,068 --> 00:29:04,219
Well, I saw her with my own two eyes,
she's definitely got something.

259
00:29:04,388 --> 00:29:07,048
Yeah, she's got something alright.
She's got Katie.

260
00:29:07,108 --> 00:29:10,384
Alright. Let's just relax, okay?

261
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:12,639
It's gonna be business as usual...

262
00:29:12,739 --> 00:29:17,339
only for the next few weeks
it'll all take place at Judy's house.

263
00:29:37,948 --> 00:29:40,746
Hi, Katie.
Could you open the door for me?

264
00:29:40,908 --> 00:29:42,585
<i>The door.

265
00:29:42,748 --> 00:29:46,423
Could you go around and
open the door for me? The-

266
00:29:46,888 --> 00:29:49,397
Yes! Th-The door.

267
00:29:51,197 --> 00:29:54,097
No, sweetie... Hi! Yeah...

268
00:29:54,198 --> 00:29:56,086
Could you open the door?

269
00:29:56,348 --> 00:29:57,506
<i>Open the door.

270
00:29:57,968 --> 00:30:00,228
Sweetie, please.
Just open the door for me?

271
00:30:04,108 --> 00:30:06,542
I'm sorry, I was indisposed. Come in.

272
00:30:08,342 --> 00:30:10,642
Sandra wait!

273
00:30:10,948 --> 00:30:13,667
Oh, yeah, Sandra certainly did wait.

274
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:18,279
- So, how are you feeling, Judy?
- Much better, thanks.

275
00:30:19,748 --> 00:30:22,978
Wait, Katie. You're certainly
learning a lot of new words.

276
00:30:23,028 --> 00:30:26,139
But it's "door" that's her favorite.
Every building she sees...

277
00:30:26,239 --> 00:30:28,739
she stops and points and says "door".

278
00:30:29,108 --> 00:30:30,587
The door!

279
00:30:30,648 --> 00:30:34,084
If it's alright with Miss Tannen,
it's alright with me.

280
00:30:34,148 --> 00:30:35,581
Let's go.

281
00:30:59,428 --> 00:31:03,004
You can watch TV for a few more minutes,
and then it's time to sleep.

282
00:31:04,428 --> 00:31:08,546
I can't believe how well she's doing.
You've really got a gift, Judy.

283
00:31:08,808 --> 00:31:11,052
Well, I guess I can empathise.

284
00:31:11,902 --> 00:31:14,057
I was a very sickly child myself...

285
00:31:14,128 --> 00:31:16,380
and I always wanted kids
of my own but...

286
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,204
I guess it was just not
meant to be.

287
00:31:20,154 --> 00:31:21,480
Anyway...

288
00:31:21,788 --> 00:31:25,943
I suppose you've noticed
that Katie is fond of, uh...

289
00:31:26,143 --> 00:31:28,143
touching herself, haven't you?

290
00:31:28,348 --> 00:31:32,043
Yeah, of course. She's even done it
in public a few times.

291
00:31:32,108 --> 00:31:34,960
- And you tried to stop her?
- Yeah, of course I have, but...

292
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,460
you know Katie.

293
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:39,294
- She's got a mind of her own.
- Yes, but children are sponges and...

294
00:31:39,528 --> 00:31:41,077
they do what they're taught to do.

295
00:31:41,548 --> 00:31:43,280
Well, not always, you know.

296
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,180
Linguisticly speaking, the seeds
of language are there from birth.

297
00:31:47,281 --> 00:31:50,580
The only way for a child
not to develop language is to...

298
00:31:50,948 --> 00:31:54,918
to do what Katie's parents did,
to isolate her completely.

299
00:31:55,828 --> 00:31:59,104
And you think the sexual instinct
works the same way?

300
00:31:59,268 --> 00:32:03,245
Well, it's not really my field
of expertise, but even...

301
00:32:03,445 --> 00:32:05,545
even infants masturbate, right?

302
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:09,187
Want sugar?

303
00:32:16,508 --> 00:32:19,663
Judy Bingham has accused me
of molesting Katie.

304
00:32:19,763 --> 00:32:22,663
I went over there yesterday,
just to check things out...

305
00:32:22,828 --> 00:32:27,458
and Judy told me if I could
take Katie out for a walk.

306
00:32:27,628 --> 00:32:30,403
So, we get back to the house.

307
00:32:30,503 --> 00:32:33,703
Katie's hair's in a mess
you know, from the wind...

308
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:36,263
- Judy looks right at her...
- She's out of her mind.

309
00:32:36,346 --> 00:32:38,646
- She's completely out of her mind!
- I-I can't describe...

310
00:32:39,028 --> 00:32:40,683
I can't tell you how I felt.

311
00:32:40,783 --> 00:32:43,650
I mean, a charge like that?
You know if it goes public?

312
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,600
I'm the last person in the world
who would hurt her.

313
00:32:45,668 --> 00:32:47,237
No one will believe her!

314
00:32:47,537 --> 00:32:50,437
You practically saved Katie.
Everyone in this hospital knows that.

315
00:32:50,687 --> 00:32:52,437
You treated her like
she was your own.

316
00:32:52,588 --> 00:32:54,005
Oh, it doesn't matter,
it doesn't matter.

317
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:57,905
By when I suit for slander,
the charges will still stick.

318
00:32:58,068 --> 00:32:59,417
Then, people will always wonder.

319
00:33:00,617 --> 00:33:02,817
I really care about that little girl.

320
00:33:03,017 --> 00:33:06,617
But, you know, I don't think
I have any choice, except to...

321
00:33:06,737 --> 00:33:08,837
quit the team.

322
00:33:09,148 --> 00:33:12,504
Katie, the door... The door?

323
00:33:12,668 --> 00:33:14,945
Oh, Katie, please. Not again.

324
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,744
<i>I'll be right back, Katie.

325
00:33:18,268 --> 00:33:20,099
What's going on?

326
00:33:20,268 --> 00:33:24,227
I don't think it's a very good idea
for you to see Katie today.

327
00:33:24,388 --> 00:33:26,389
Your visits are tiring her.

328
00:33:26,739 --> 00:33:29,050
Since when?
Since when do you decide...

329
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,107
who she sees or doesn't see?
You're not her guardian.

330
00:33:31,168 --> 00:33:34,000
Well, as a matter of fact,
I've applied to become just that.

331
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:37,007
And until Social Services
make their decision...

332
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:39,507
she is to remain in my custody.

333
00:33:39,828 --> 00:33:41,519
Judy, don't you realize
what you're doing?

334
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:43,619
You're cutting her off
from the rest of the world.

335
00:33:43,719 --> 00:33:46,219
It's like she's right back
in the house she grew up in.

336
00:33:48,028 --> 00:33:51,083
First, Stan York and then me.
Who's gonna be next, huh?

337
00:33:51,183 --> 00:33:55,053
Are you gonna go on holding her
hostage for the rest of her life?

338
00:34:01,303 --> 00:34:03,483
<i>How about this one?

339
00:34:05,233 --> 00:34:07,783
<i>No? Okay.

340
00:34:09,188 --> 00:34:11,463
<i>Do you know what that is?

341
00:34:15,148 --> 00:34:16,501
<i>And what about that?

342
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:21,900
<i>Like log.

343
00:34:21,948 --> 00:34:23,849
<i>Yes, yes! That's it!

344
00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:26,902
<i>I didn't even know
you knew what a log was!

345
00:34:27,668 --> 00:34:31,217
<i>Okay, how about... this one?

346
00:34:32,068 --> 00:34:34,020
- Am I disturbing anything?
- No, not at all.

347
00:34:34,188 --> 00:34:37,102
I was just reviewing the same work
I was doing over a month ago.

348
00:34:37,202 --> 00:34:40,102
It's, uh, pretty much
all I can do at this point.

349
00:34:40,268 --> 00:34:43,048
You know, Beverly and I
have been talking...

350
00:34:43,298 --> 00:34:46,259
about this whole situation and...

351
00:34:46,408 --> 00:34:52,678
well, we've... pretty much decided
to apply as Katie's foster parents.

352
00:34:52,748 --> 00:34:54,419
Oh, Norman.

353
00:34:54,819 --> 00:34:57,119
That's the best news
I've heard in weeks.

354
00:34:57,188 --> 00:35:02,018
It's not a firm decision yet.
Katie, obviously, she's a handful and...

355
00:35:02,068 --> 00:35:05,747
- we do have three children of our own.
- Of course, of course.

356
00:35:05,908 --> 00:35:09,218
In my rush I hadn't even
given that any consideration.

357
00:35:09,388 --> 00:35:12,266
And then, I've already taken over
as Katie's therapist.

358
00:35:12,428 --> 00:35:16,785
Beverly, with her background in
child development will be of help...

359
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:21,903
but I'm also researching on the case,
so, to try to balance all of that is, uh...

360
00:35:22,168 --> 00:35:25,918
Yeah, I see, I see.
I see your dilemma.

361
00:35:25,968 --> 00:35:29,927
But, I think it can be done. So, if...

362
00:35:30,088 --> 00:35:33,046
Katie's social workers give us
the go-ahead, then we're...

363
00:35:33,446 --> 00:35:35,346
we will all gonna give it a shot.

364
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,820
<i>Katie!</i>

365
00:35:55,048 --> 00:35:56,820
You forgot one.

366
00:36:01,108 --> 00:36:02,921
I love you.

367
00:36:09,988 --> 00:36:11,721
I don't know what to say.

368
00:36:12,788 --> 00:36:14,288
Not now, you don't.

369
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:16,164
But believe me, this is not over yet.

370
00:36:16,228 --> 00:36:20,567
You're depriving this child of the best home
she's ever had. Or ever will have!

371
00:36:20,628 --> 00:36:24,864
And I'm gonna make sure you all pay,
if it's the last thing I ever do!

372
00:36:52,028 --> 00:36:56,738
... I tell you every morning. Let's go!
- You forgot your lunch.

373
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:01,938
Katie... ?

374
00:38:03,038 --> 00:38:04,338
Katie!

375
00:38:10,938 --> 00:38:12,438
Katie, what are you doing?

376
00:38:13,428 --> 00:38:15,923
Stop that right this second!

377
00:38:20,388 --> 00:38:23,061
Katie, watch me, okay? Watch this.

378
00:38:24,388 --> 00:38:29,679
I am so mad! Boy, I'm so mad
I could just- you see?

379
00:38:29,748 --> 00:38:33,021
I'm so mad I can just throw
a complete tantrum!

380
00:38:35,121 --> 00:38:39,521
You see me? I'm so mad!
I'm so mad! I'm so mad!!!

381
00:38:39,668 --> 00:38:44,184
Harder! Good! Now say: I am mad!
Katie say: I'm mad!

382
00:38:44,348 --> 00:38:47,226
- Katie mad!
- Good. Now jump up and down!

383
00:38:47,388 --> 00:38:49,039
I know this is helping Katie but...

384
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:52,239
you may live to regret this one day.

385
00:38:52,339 --> 00:38:54,039
Jump up and down! Good! Now say...

386
00:38:54,139 --> 00:38:55,888
I am very, very angry!

387
00:38:56,188 --> 00:38:58,340
I am very, very angry!

388
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:02,960
Good! Run over here and slam the door.
Just slam the door!

389
00:39:03,028 --> 00:39:04,717
You might be right.

390
00:39:05,688 --> 00:39:10,637
Car has "meer".

391
00:39:16,048 --> 00:39:21,445
The car has a mirror.

392
00:39:21,708 --> 00:39:24,406
- Katie, did you take my hairbrush?
- Can this wait till later?

393
00:39:24,568 --> 00:39:27,580
I'm sorry but she's been appropriating
too many of my things...

394
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,680
and frankly, my patience
is running a little thin!

395
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,180
Uh, I'd better talk to her.

396
00:39:39,881 --> 00:39:45,505
- So, what should we do now?
- Want Sandra play piano.

397
00:39:45,668 --> 00:39:50,423
Oh, it's concert time, is it?
Alright. Alright.

398
00:39:51,868 --> 00:39:53,938
What do you wanna hear me play?

399
00:39:56,548 --> 00:40:00,148
I'm trying really hard.
I really am...

400
00:40:00,348 --> 00:40:04,387
but sometimes, I don't think you guys
realize I have problems too...

401
00:40:07,888 --> 00:40:10,748
Oh, come on. Of course, we do.

402
00:40:30,908 --> 00:40:34,918
Oh! We have a request for Chopin.

403
00:40:36,528 --> 00:40:39,296
Let me find something I know.

404
00:42:05,722 --> 00:42:07,922
Welcome. Hi, there.

405
00:42:08,148 --> 00:42:09,698
So, I...

406
00:42:09,898 --> 00:42:11,698
I believe this is the first time...

407
00:42:11,798 --> 00:42:15,298
you've ever actually seen me
in person, is it?

408
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,462
You're a lot shorter
than I thought you'd be.

409
00:42:19,535 --> 00:42:22,535
It's so nice to finally meet you,
Mrs. Standon.

410
00:42:22,685 --> 00:42:24,304
Louise.

411
00:42:30,328 --> 00:42:32,159
Katie, momma's here!

412
00:42:32,228 --> 00:42:34,280
So, would you like something to drink?

413
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,380
I don't think that I would. Thank you.

414
00:42:36,548 --> 00:42:40,746
Lunch is almost ready. I made
something special. I hope you like it.

415
00:42:40,908 --> 00:42:43,881
<i>Here she is. Here's Katie.</i>

416
00:42:54,388 --> 00:42:59,587
Happy- Katie happy momma see.

417
00:43:04,268 --> 00:43:08,247
What have you done to her
to make her walk so peculiar?

418
00:43:23,108 --> 00:43:27,624
- So, uh, I hear you're from Oklahoma.
- I used to be.

419
00:43:27,788 --> 00:43:31,303
- Have you ever seen a tornado?
- Once.

420
00:43:32,348 --> 00:43:37,376
I actually did a paper for school
on tornados. I found it's interesting.

421
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:40,968
They actually hit Los Angeles
a couple of times.

422
00:43:41,748 --> 00:43:43,048
I don't believe that.

423
00:43:43,198 --> 00:43:46,980
Well, think about it. You got
warm air coming up from Baja...

424
00:43:47,248 --> 00:43:49,527
cold air coming down from
Sierra Nevadas, so it's...

425
00:43:49,677 --> 00:43:52,564
the interaction of those two fronts,
they cause a tornado.

426
00:43:53,428 --> 00:43:56,548
Jonathan's got the family aptitude
for science.

427
00:43:56,948 --> 00:43:58,148
I beg your pardon?

428
00:43:58,988 --> 00:44:00,088
Katie.

429
00:44:01,658 --> 00:44:05,158
What are you supposed to do before
you reach for something at the table?

430
00:44:05,348 --> 00:44:07,823
You're supposed to ask, right?

431
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:11,979
Now say: May I have
the applesauce please?

432
00:44:12,248 --> 00:44:13,920
Come on, Katie.

433
00:44:14,088 --> 00:44:15,521
Come on. You can do that.

434
00:44:15,688 --> 00:44:18,245
Don't torture the child.
If she doesn't wanna say anything...

435
00:44:18,305 --> 00:44:19,945
she doesn't have to.

436
00:44:53,028 --> 00:44:57,307
I mean, she could have at least
acknowledged the operation.

437
00:44:57,468 --> 00:45:01,380
It's not like we arranged it
like some form of blackmail.

438
00:45:01,548 --> 00:45:05,223
I think she must be... overwhelmed.

439
00:45:05,388 --> 00:45:08,879
Personally, I don't know
how well I would take it...

440
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:11,879
if I arrived at a
complete stranger's house...

441
00:45:11,948 --> 00:45:14,359
and then I saw this complete stranger...

442
00:45:14,459 --> 00:45:17,359
acting as a surragate mother to my child.

443
00:45:20,028 --> 00:45:22,496
I guess she must feel pretty powerless.

444
00:45:40,328 --> 00:45:42,000
Good morning, Katie.

445
00:45:44,028 --> 00:45:46,742
Get up. It's time for breakfast.

446
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:11,450
Well, it's finally happened.

447
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:14,605
- What's finally happened?
- What we've been waiting for.

448
00:46:24,305 --> 00:46:25,905
Hi, Katie.

449
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:32,905
Hi.

450
00:46:34,288 --> 00:46:37,458
I know Beverly already tried
to explain this to you.

451
00:46:37,558 --> 00:46:40,558
You really don't have anything
to be afraid of.

452
00:46:42,268 --> 00:46:44,822
What happened to you
happens to every woman.

453
00:46:44,922 --> 00:46:47,422
It happens to me, to Beverly.

454
00:46:49,028 --> 00:46:52,179
It just means you're becoming
a big girl, that's what it means.

455
00:46:55,228 --> 00:46:57,822
I think she'll be alright.

456
00:46:57,988 --> 00:47:01,344
God, she's just finished toilet training.
She's already menstruating.

457
00:47:01,508 --> 00:47:04,304
Well, there is a silver lining
to all this.

458
00:47:04,504 --> 00:47:06,200
The critical period's over.

459
00:47:06,268 --> 00:47:09,465
Anything Katie learns from now on
is over the line.

460
00:47:09,628 --> 00:47:15,146
So, we're gonna finally find out
if the Lenneberg theory is correct.

461
00:47:15,308 --> 00:47:18,345
It's not a theory, it's a hypothesis.

462
00:47:18,508 --> 00:47:21,343
Katie's gonna prove it wrong.

463
00:47:21,393 --> 00:47:22,847
You just watch.

464
00:47:26,388 --> 00:47:31,143
Alright. Quiet now, people!
I have an announcement.

465
00:47:31,508 --> 00:47:35,221
We have a new student who's
going to be joining us today.

466
00:47:35,388 --> 00:47:39,745
Now, she's a little bit older
than the rest of you...

467
00:47:40,008 --> 00:47:43,364
but, she's never been to
school before. So...

468
00:47:43,428 --> 00:47:46,972
I want you all to be
specially nice to her.

469
00:47:47,022 --> 00:47:51,705
- Do I make myself clear?
- Yes, Miss Brill.

470
00:47:51,968 --> 00:47:56,783
Class, this is Katie Standon.
And what do we say to Katie?

471
00:47:56,883 --> 00:47:59,783
Hi, Katie.

472
00:48:00,966 --> 00:48:03,166
Alright, dear. You can sit down
wherever you like.

473
00:48:03,257 --> 00:48:04,857
Sit here!

474
00:48:26,548 --> 00:48:28,666
Now, Katie, this is Kurt.

475
00:48:30,148 --> 00:48:34,236
He's already been told where
to drop you off, so don't worry.

476
00:49:27,708 --> 00:49:31,066
It must've taken two whole minutes
till we finally got her loose.

477
00:49:31,128 --> 00:49:32,702
How did the bus driver take it?

478
00:49:32,802 --> 00:49:35,968
He was great, he was great!
He's a really nice guy.

479
00:49:36,068 --> 00:49:39,663
- Did I mention he's gorgeous?
- Several times.

480
00:49:41,308 --> 00:49:44,983
I told Katie if I were unattached
I'd go for him in a heartbeat.

481
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:48,624
- Well, you're not.
- I'm sorry.

482
00:49:50,508 --> 00:49:55,298
God, I know, I'm with Katie so much.
Oh, she can be such a tease!

483
00:49:55,468 --> 00:50:00,144
She's got this really playful side
that... You'll see one day.

484
00:50:00,308 --> 00:50:04,779
She's got this amazing capacity to
catch you up in whatever mood she's in.

485
00:50:04,948 --> 00:50:09,226
It's magical. Yap.
She's just magical, right?

486
00:50:11,988 --> 00:50:13,785
Hey... there's something wrong?

487
00:50:13,948 --> 00:50:17,005
Ever since you started working with
Katie, I've heard so much about her.

488
00:50:17,405 --> 00:50:19,805
That's pretty much all
you can talk about.

489
00:50:19,868 --> 00:50:24,544
- So, I'm boring you.
- No, but- you keep building her up.

490
00:50:24,708 --> 00:50:28,701
You keep saying I'm gonna meet her
one day, so I'm just-

491
00:50:28,868 --> 00:50:31,788
I really don't wanna be
disappointed, you know?

492
00:50:31,988 --> 00:50:33,988
I mean, nobody can be that great.

493
00:50:35,288 --> 00:50:38,088
Fine... fine.

494
00:50:38,808 --> 00:50:42,178
From now on, my lips are sealed.

495
00:50:47,688 --> 00:50:51,901
Where is "May I have 10 cents"?

496
00:50:53,688 --> 00:50:55,838
Does that sound like a question, Katie?

497
00:50:56,008 --> 00:50:57,446
Question.

498
00:50:57,508 --> 00:51:00,944
Ok, I want you to just try again.
This time, try very hard.

499
00:51:02,368 --> 00:51:05,216
Oh, Geez, I-I am so sorry.

500
00:51:05,566 --> 00:51:07,926
I was at the hospital and...

501
00:51:07,988 --> 00:51:10,306
Ah, Norman, this is Eleanor...
sorry, I don't remember...

502
00:51:10,406 --> 00:51:12,206
- Schultz.
- How do you do?

503
00:51:12,308 --> 00:51:14,176
- And this is Dr. Richard Tennison.
- Hello.

504
00:51:14,348 --> 00:51:16,943
- We are from the National...
- Institute of Mental Health, yes.

505
00:51:17,043 --> 00:51:19,990
Beverly called me and told me you were-
you know, actually- pardon me...

506
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,124
I assumed that we were gonna be
seeing each other at my office.

507
00:51:23,188 --> 00:51:27,816
<i>This is the place where most of
the work takes place, isn't it?</i>

508
00:51:28,388 --> 00:51:31,021
Katie! You know better than that!

509
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:33,821
Beverly doesn't like it
when you spit on the floor.

510
00:51:34,088 --> 00:51:36,607
Toy go coal mine?

511
00:51:36,668 --> 00:51:39,182
Ah, coal mine is in the basement.

512
00:51:39,348 --> 00:51:43,347
You see, sometimes we appropriate
some of Katie's toys as a...

513
00:51:43,447 --> 00:51:45,447
kind of a disciplinary, uh...

514
00:51:46,108 --> 00:51:48,324
Why don't I just show you around?

515
00:52:03,408 --> 00:52:06,400
The spoon goes here, Katie.

516
00:52:11,968 --> 00:52:13,642
I showed them all the videotape I shot.

517
00:52:13,742 --> 00:52:16,042
For almost an hour,
they sit there looking at it...

518
00:52:16,108 --> 00:52:18,137
and now all they can say is:
"So where is your research"?

519
00:52:18,237 --> 00:52:20,537
I just showed them my damned research!

520
00:52:20,708 --> 00:52:23,461
And they started on how
it's not all perfectly catalogued.

521
00:52:23,928 --> 00:52:26,244
Well, that's what they're
paying for, isn't it?

522
00:52:26,308 --> 00:52:29,226
Of course it is. But it's not fair
for them to drop by and expect...

523
00:52:29,388 --> 00:52:31,719
- everything to be just perf-
- Mom, we need you in here!

524
00:52:31,819 --> 00:52:33,919
God, here we go again.

525
00:52:37,128 --> 00:52:41,241
Norm, you don't think we're in any
danger of losing the grant, do you?

526
00:52:41,308 --> 00:52:44,821
Of course not. They know
how important this is. I just...

527
00:52:44,988 --> 00:52:47,582
I just need to clarify
my part of the research.

528
00:52:55,045 --> 00:52:56,345
Good morning, Katie!

529
00:53:36,208 --> 00:53:37,926
What's that?

530
00:53:41,388 --> 00:53:44,221
Kurt loves Katie.

531
00:53:47,068 --> 00:53:51,141
Miss Brill, Miss Brill!
Katie's drawing dirty pictures.

532
00:53:58,028 --> 00:54:00,403
Katie! Why did you do that?

533
00:54:01,168 --> 00:54:03,138
Very very angry!

534
00:55:00,068 --> 00:55:01,881
Katie, what's wrong, huh?

535
00:55:04,268 --> 00:55:08,363
I'm not gonna hurt you.
You know that.

536
00:55:12,028 --> 00:55:14,403
Tell me what's bothering you?

537
00:55:16,208 --> 00:55:18,517
Come on, put it into words.

538
00:55:50,248 --> 00:55:52,806
I never did get out to the beach much.

539
00:55:53,806 --> 00:55:55,806
Wes would never take me.

540
00:55:59,268 --> 00:56:01,543
He was a cruel man, wasn't he?

541
00:56:03,228 --> 00:56:05,503
<i>Katie said something the other day.</i>

542
00:56:05,968 --> 00:56:09,627
She said, and these are
her exact words:

543
00:56:10,188 --> 00:56:12,941
<i>"Father hit big stick. "</i>

544
00:56:13,008 --> 00:56:15,938
Do you have any idea
what that might mean?

545
00:56:18,028 --> 00:56:20,906
Well, Wes didn't like noise.

546
00:56:21,068 --> 00:56:23,582
That's why he didn't want children.

547
00:56:23,948 --> 00:56:27,907
And Katie, well, sometimes...

548
00:56:29,808 --> 00:56:31,785
She'd make noise.

549
00:56:31,848 --> 00:56:33,820
And Wes he kept a...

550
00:56:35,908 --> 00:56:40,081
a big stick in the corner of the room
for when she acted up.

551
00:56:40,181 --> 00:56:44,307
- So, how often did he beat her?
- Not all that much.

552
00:56:46,268 --> 00:56:49,419
He had a few other ways
of keeping her quiet.

553
00:56:49,888 --> 00:56:53,025
<i>- Like... ?</i>
- He'd growl.

554
00:56:53,708 --> 00:56:57,224
- What?
- He'd growl.

555
00:56:59,208 --> 00:57:00,899
Like a dog.

556
00:57:03,308 --> 00:57:05,984
- And that kept her quiet?
- I imagine so. Otherwise...

557
00:57:06,084 --> 00:57:07,984
he wouldn't have kept on doing it.

558
00:57:11,708 --> 00:57:14,707
Those people Katie lives with, the Glazers?

559
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:17,207
They don't care for me much, do they?

560
00:57:18,388 --> 00:57:19,901
I wouldn't say that.

561
00:57:20,068 --> 00:57:23,185
Then why they won't let me
see Katie at their house?

562
00:57:24,528 --> 00:57:27,685
Why do you have to drive Katie
all the way out here...

563
00:57:27,785 --> 00:57:30,385
just so I can spend
some time with her?

564
00:57:31,868 --> 00:57:34,057
Well, I think the Glazers...

565
00:57:35,157 --> 00:57:38,657
they're concerned that you
might not feel comfortable...

566
00:57:38,828 --> 00:57:43,982
seeing Katie with... well,
you know, foster parents.

567
00:57:44,148 --> 00:57:45,857
It's not that they don't like you.

568
00:57:45,957 --> 00:57:48,057
They're just trying to be considerate.

569
00:58:09,088 --> 00:58:13,066
Come on, Katie. Ask me a question.

570
00:58:13,228 --> 00:58:16,504
I don't care what it is,
just ask me something.

571
00:58:17,548 --> 00:58:21,018
- Dark.
- Yes, it is dark. It's late.

572
00:58:21,188 --> 00:58:23,941
Just ask me a question,
it will be all through.

573
00:58:25,188 --> 00:58:28,942
Where Kurt come Thursday?

574
00:58:30,628 --> 00:58:33,408
So, what you really want
to ask me is:

575
00:58:33,508 --> 00:58:38,308
"Where will Kurt pick me up
on Thursday?". Right?

576
00:58:38,768 --> 00:58:40,221
Dark.

577
00:58:43,348 --> 00:58:45,623
Alright. Let's call it a day.

578
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:50,545
Remember when I told you I had
a friend I wanted you to meet?

579
00:58:50,645 --> 00:58:52,850
The one named Rob. Remember?

580
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:55,078
Well, he's finally made it over.

581
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,578
Come on.

582
00:58:58,528 --> 00:58:59,881
Get up.

583
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:17,622
Rob, this is Katie.
Katie, this is Rob.

584
00:59:17,922 --> 00:59:19,122
Hi, Katie.

585
00:59:23,368 --> 00:59:25,859
Katie! Where are you going?

586
00:59:30,188 --> 00:59:34,500
- It's very pretty, Katie.
- She made it all by herself.

587
00:59:34,668 --> 00:59:36,738
- You did?
- I sew dress.

588
00:59:36,908 --> 00:59:39,579
Beverly taught her how to
operate the sewing machine.

589
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:41,379
Rob want Graham cracker?

590
00:59:41,548 --> 00:59:44,000
I think she's inviting you
for a snack.

591
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:47,281
Ask him again. But this time,
put it in a question.

592
00:59:47,928 --> 00:59:51,079
I where is cracker?

593
00:59:52,428 --> 00:59:55,306
I'd be honoured to share
a Graham cracker with you.

594
01:00:15,208 --> 01:00:18,678
- What are you doing?
- Go back to bed, Rob.

595
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:24,739
- Can that wait until morning?
- Rob, please, go back to bed.

596
01:00:34,528 --> 01:00:36,198
She's leveled off.

597
01:00:37,098 --> 01:00:40,398
I don't think she's making
any true progress at all.

598
01:00:40,768 --> 01:00:44,666
I mean, the vocabulary is there...

599
01:00:44,828 --> 01:00:47,102
but it's not at the normal level
that you'd find in a...

600
01:00:47,202 --> 01:00:50,102
in the average child just
entering kindergarden.

601
01:00:50,568 --> 01:00:52,706
Even with the words she has learned...

602
01:00:52,806 --> 01:00:56,006
she can't construct a grammatical
sentence in English.

603
01:00:56,988 --> 01:00:59,661
Or anything beyond the rudimentary.

604
01:00:59,828 --> 01:01:04,082
"I like sewing". In Katie's case,
it could just as easily be "Sewing like I. "

605
01:01:04,148 --> 01:01:06,387
Even when she is being grammatical,
it's not...

606
01:01:06,548 --> 01:01:10,045
Not on purpose. Yeah, I see your point.

607
01:01:11,508 --> 01:01:15,163
You know, what really amazes me is
how effective she is when...

608
01:01:15,263 --> 01:01:17,763
when she is not relying on speech.

609
01:01:20,948 --> 01:01:24,888
She always manages to find some way
to make herself understood, Norm.

610
01:01:24,988 --> 01:01:27,489
And she is so good with her hands.

611
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:31,124
Maybe we can find a way
to combine the two.

612
01:01:34,788 --> 01:01:37,256
Okay, let's try that again. Ready?

613
01:01:37,428 --> 01:01:42,263
I-will-see...

614
01:01:42,428 --> 01:01:44,225
No, like that. Two fingers.

615
01:01:44,388 --> 01:01:50,827
see-the-dentist-tomorrow.

616
01:01:50,988 --> 01:01:56,540
Do it again? One more time?
I-will-see...

617
01:01:56,708 --> 01:02:01,736
the-dentist-tomorrow.

618
01:02:02,236 --> 01:02:03,936
Very good, very good!

619
01:02:04,808 --> 01:02:08,265
Hey, say something to Sandra.
Anything you wanna say.

620
01:02:09,468 --> 01:02:14,701
Katie loves Sandra.

621
01:02:16,908 --> 01:02:20,787
Sandra loves Katie too.

622
01:02:33,157 --> 01:02:34,257
Mom.

623
01:02:56,928 --> 01:02:59,059
Hey! When did you get home?

624
01:03:02,348 --> 01:03:04,657
They've discontinued the grant.

625
01:03:06,057 --> 01:03:07,157
What?

626
01:03:08,028 --> 01:03:11,101
The National Institute
of Mental Health. They dropped it.

627
01:03:11,268 --> 01:03:13,106
I kept telling Norm to organise
his research better.

628
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:16,106
And he kept telling me
"Oh, everything's fine. "

629
01:03:16,468 --> 01:03:18,823
So where does that leave Katie?

630
01:03:21,928 --> 01:03:25,261
The Glazers have already made
new arrangements. You believe this?

631
01:03:25,345 --> 01:03:27,045
They've already found
new accommodations.

632
01:03:27,195 --> 01:03:28,980
New accommodations where?

633
01:03:31,288 --> 01:03:33,044
I fixed up your room.

634
01:03:34,108 --> 01:03:36,224
You wanna go see it?

635
01:03:37,928 --> 01:03:39,259
Go ahead, Katie.

636
01:04:26,158 --> 01:04:27,821
It's brandnew.

637
01:04:29,068 --> 01:04:31,536
They just delivered it this morning.

638
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,100
He's gone already, huh?

639
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:58,946
Why don't I fix us something to eat?

640
01:05:26,908 --> 01:05:29,162
I think when you actually see
the institution you'll agree...

641
01:05:29,305 --> 01:05:32,305
that Katie couldn't find
better care anywhere.

642
01:05:35,827 --> 01:05:38,027
- Well, hello there.
- Hi.

643
01:05:38,148 --> 01:05:41,350
- Uh, Mrs. Dure, this is, uh...
- Duryea.

644
01:05:41,425 --> 01:05:44,525
Duryea, this is Sandra Tannen.

645
01:05:45,008 --> 01:05:47,242
She used to work with Katie.

646
01:05:47,308 --> 01:05:50,300
Actually, I think I'm gonna have
the chance to work with her again.

647
01:05:50,468 --> 01:05:53,017
It looks like the National Science
Foundation's gonna approve...

648
01:05:53,103 --> 01:05:54,403
my grant proposal.

649
01:05:54,553 --> 01:05:58,078
Really? Do you know Peter Chang?
He is at the N. S. F.

650
01:05:58,128 --> 01:06:00,883
No, I-doesn't ring a bell.

651
01:06:01,428 --> 01:06:03,017
Well, I'd better run.

652
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:06,060
Give me a call tomorrow, Louise.
I'm gonna try to set up a meeting...

653
01:06:06,110 --> 01:06:07,603
- to get together and see the place.
- Fine.

654
01:06:07,688 --> 01:06:09,280
And... it was nice meeting you.

655
01:06:11,148 --> 01:06:14,584
Nice woman.
I didn't quite get what she does.

656
01:06:15,986 --> 01:06:17,386
Hi, Katie!

657
01:06:19,887 --> 01:06:21,187
How are you?

658
01:06:22,388 --> 01:06:26,620
Oh, yes, I know. You miss Beverly.
I'm sure she misses you too.

659
01:06:30,868 --> 01:06:34,268
Wow, look at that.

660
01:06:36,068 --> 01:06:39,237
That is just the best picture
anybody's ever made of me.

661
01:06:44,348 --> 01:06:49,183
Know what? Why don't you make
another picture, of Rob?

662
01:06:49,348 --> 01:06:53,277
So I can take it home and show him
what a great artist you are.

663
01:07:06,828 --> 01:07:08,828
Louise...

664
01:07:10,628 --> 01:07:14,485
Louise, I hope you aren't considering
placing Katie in some institution?

665
01:07:16,728 --> 01:07:19,023
I can't see that I have much choice.

666
01:07:20,308 --> 01:07:22,324
She spits all over my nice,
clean floors...

667
01:07:22,446 --> 01:07:25,046
she stamps her feet and
slams the doors.

668
01:07:26,068 --> 01:07:29,019
And she rubs her hands all over
her private parts.

669
01:07:35,848 --> 01:07:37,759
She never used to do such things.

670
01:07:40,348 --> 01:07:42,384
She wasn't able to.

671
01:07:45,110 --> 01:07:48,307
Oh, God. I thought
I could take care of her again.

672
01:07:50,988 --> 01:07:53,502
Katie's got a lot of problems.

673
01:07:55,388 --> 01:07:58,027
I didn't realize the kinds of
problems she's got.

674
01:07:58,188 --> 01:08:01,544
You know what I would do
if I were in your place, Louise?

675
01:08:03,828 --> 01:08:06,425
I would call the Department of
Social Services...

676
01:08:06,506 --> 01:08:09,506
I would ask them to place Katie
in a foster home.

677
01:08:10,088 --> 01:08:13,920
You know, some- a nice couple whose
kids have left home or...

678
01:08:13,988 --> 01:08:16,866
maybe the kids are old enough
to help out.

679
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:22,624
I would hate to see her end up in
an institution, Louise. It is...

680
01:08:22,788 --> 01:08:25,488
too cold an environment
for someone like Katie.

681
01:08:25,588 --> 01:08:27,245
She needs love.

682
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:29,920
She needs a family.

683
01:09:01,188 --> 01:09:03,179
Let's bow our heads in prayer.

684
01:09:05,228 --> 01:09:07,700
Katie. What did I just say?

685
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,860
Head pray?

686
01:09:13,428 --> 01:09:15,428
Thank you, Colleen.

687
01:09:20,228 --> 01:09:23,205
Heavenly Father, we thank Thee
for these blessings...

688
01:09:23,355 --> 01:09:25,661
that You have bestowed upon us.

689
01:09:25,728 --> 01:09:30,426
We pray that You guide our actions
as we perform Your work.

690
01:10:02,117 --> 01:10:03,317
Jill!

691
01:10:03,608 --> 01:10:05,990
You know you aren't supposed
to use sign language.

692
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:08,000
If you've something to say, just say it.

693
01:10:08,050 --> 01:10:10,964
We can't understand you
when you talk with your hands.

694
01:10:11,028 --> 01:10:13,196
That goes for you too, Katie.

695
01:10:24,848 --> 01:10:27,003
My brother got killed in Vietnam.

696
01:10:27,268 --> 01:10:31,903
He stepped on a bomb and
he got blown up.

697
01:10:32,268 --> 01:10:34,099
Blow uh?

698
01:10:37,588 --> 01:10:41,351
Katie, I told you.
You can't wear jewelry to church.

699
01:10:41,401 --> 01:10:43,020
Now, give me the neckless.

700
01:10:44,488 --> 01:10:46,961
Don't fool around now, Katie. Come on.

701
01:10:47,011 --> 01:10:49,021
- You'll make us all late.
- Very, very angry!

702
01:10:49,188 --> 01:10:51,338
That will be quite enough
of that, young lady!

703
01:10:52,128 --> 01:10:55,025
- So where's the girl?
- Oh, she moved.

704
01:10:56,588 --> 01:10:58,303
She's doing well, I hope.

705
01:10:58,453 --> 01:11:01,004
Yeah. She's doing really-
really well. Thanks.

706
01:11:10,908 --> 01:11:14,742
Well. If it isn't the famous
linguist herself!

707
01:11:14,808 --> 01:11:17,209
And you are becoming
quite famous, you know.

708
01:11:17,359 --> 01:11:18,665
Hello, Judy.

709
01:11:19,328 --> 01:11:21,469
I read your little article
that you got published.

710
01:11:21,619 --> 01:11:23,301
What was it called? Oh, yes.

711
01:11:23,668 --> 01:11:27,900
"Linguistic Development in the
Modern Day Wild-Child".

712
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,476
Catchy title.

713
01:11:29,726 --> 01:11:33,082
But... a little insulting to Katie.
Don't you think?

714
01:11:33,348 --> 01:11:34,804
I mean...

715
01:11:35,254 --> 01:11:40,534
saying that Katie couldn't form-
what was it? grammatical questions.

716
01:11:40,728 --> 01:11:42,246
That's a lie!

717
01:11:42,308 --> 01:11:45,240
Maybe she never did when she was with you,
but when she was living with me...

718
01:11:45,365 --> 01:11:47,179
she asked grammatical questions
all the time!

719
01:11:47,248 --> 01:11:49,599
And saying that her father hit her
for vocalizing?

720
01:11:49,649 --> 01:11:53,248
What editors do you have,
to make a remark of that kind?!

721
01:11:53,348 --> 01:11:56,863
That's not science! That's conjecture!

722
01:12:07,148 --> 01:12:09,972
Would you like me to cut a banana
to put on your cereal?

723
01:12:10,122 --> 01:12:11,478
No banana.

724
01:12:13,028 --> 01:12:14,939
Colleen, pass me the sugar?

725
01:12:20,728 --> 01:12:23,904
I-I-I'll take her to the bathroom.

726
01:12:23,968 --> 01:12:25,321
Wait a minute.

727
01:12:26,928 --> 01:12:29,533
I'll get something to clean this up.

728
01:12:39,083 --> 01:12:40,400
Oh, my God.

729
01:12:46,468 --> 01:12:48,682
And furthermore, I told her
she could no longer have...

730
01:12:48,732 --> 01:12:50,004
any visits from her mother.

731
01:12:50,068 --> 01:12:51,738
Why?

732
01:12:52,508 --> 01:12:54,888
Because she looks forward to them.

733
01:12:54,988 --> 01:12:56,839
The only way to impress a child...

734
01:12:56,889 --> 01:12:59,457
is to deprive it of something
that it values.

735
01:13:00,028 --> 01:13:02,538
Mrs. Manning,
didn't the DSS tell you...

736
01:13:02,688 --> 01:13:06,240
that this girl has an extremely
unusual background?

737
01:13:06,908 --> 01:13:10,683
We have two other foster children
with equally unusual backgrounds.

738
01:13:10,748 --> 01:13:13,071
They don't go around
eating their own vomit.

739
01:13:13,221 --> 01:13:15,038
It's the act of an animal.

740
01:13:28,938 --> 01:13:33,346
Tell me more about Kurt, Katie.
I wanna hear more about Kurt.

741
01:13:43,388 --> 01:13:44,940
Hi, Katie.

742
01:13:56,090 --> 01:13:57,905
I heard about your accident.

743
01:13:59,068 --> 01:14:01,184
Do you wanna tell me about it?

744
01:14:04,408 --> 01:14:08,339
You're keeping your mouth shut because
you're afraid you'd vomit, right?

745
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,059
Is that what you're doing?

746
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:16,516
Then why don't you use sign language?

747
01:14:16,788 --> 01:14:19,000
Mr. Manning doesn't want us
to use sign language.

748
01:14:19,050 --> 01:14:21,842
- Mr. Manning says-
- Mr. Manning can go to hell!

749
01:14:24,708 --> 01:14:27,857
Colleen? Uh, don't tell Mr. Manning
that I said that.

750
01:14:27,907 --> 01:14:30,041
I don't want him
to take it out on Katie.

751
01:14:30,108 --> 01:14:31,764
I-I promise.

752
01:14:35,968 --> 01:14:37,844
Talk to me.

753
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,300
Katie, please. Talk to me.

754
01:14:44,928 --> 01:14:49,141
If you'd just see her for yourself,
Norm, you'd understand why I'm-

755
01:14:51,808 --> 01:14:54,080
But all I'm asking is for you
to just take her back...

756
01:14:54,230 --> 01:14:55,475
to Children's Hospital.

757
01:14:55,525 --> 01:14:58,358
This house is the worst placement
you could possibly-

758
01:14:59,988 --> 01:15:01,980
We'll figure that out later.
First, we've got to...

759
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:03,842
get her out of that house.

760
01:15:04,108 --> 01:15:08,080
I'm not exaggerating in the slightest.
This is a real crisis. It's-

761
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,469
Okay.

762
01:15:11,919 --> 01:15:13,991
Okay, okay...

763
01:15:14,141 --> 01:15:15,366
Thank you, Norm.

764
01:15:16,216 --> 01:15:17,445
Thank you.

765
01:15:19,195 --> 01:15:21,393
- He's going to help?
- Yeah...

766
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,720
He's gonna help.

767
01:15:53,308 --> 01:15:55,061
Good morning, Miss Tannen.

768
01:15:55,311 --> 01:15:56,675
Good morning.

769
01:15:57,668 --> 01:16:00,554
Please, Katie, you've got to eat.

770
01:16:00,604 --> 01:16:03,113
Katie, you've got to eat.
If you don't eat, you'll get sick.

771
01:16:03,363 --> 01:16:05,233
Katie, come on!

772
01:16:05,828 --> 01:16:08,334
Open. Open, open. You're okay.

773
01:16:08,484 --> 01:16:10,643
You're okay. Open. Good.

774
01:16:42,175 --> 01:16:43,475
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

775
01:16:43,708 --> 01:16:46,021
- Can I help you?
- Yes. I would like to speak...

776
01:16:46,088 --> 01:16:49,095
to the social worker who's
handling the Standon case.

777
01:16:49,145 --> 01:16:52,103
- Standon?
- Yeah. Katie Standon.

778
01:16:53,188 --> 01:16:55,731
If you would just pay her a visit,
I'm sure you would see...

779
01:16:55,881 --> 01:16:58,237
that she's got to be
relocated immediately.

780
01:16:58,308 --> 01:17:02,221
It's awful there.
She won't eat, she won't speak.

781
01:17:02,488 --> 01:17:05,685
It seems like she's the problem,
not the foster parents.

782
01:17:07,148 --> 01:17:10,006
Do you know even the slightest thing
about her background?

783
01:17:10,068 --> 01:17:13,185
We are talking about
a very unique child, here.

784
01:17:13,348 --> 01:17:17,057
They're all unique.
You see all these files on my desk?

785
01:17:17,228 --> 01:17:19,500
There's a child that goes
with each one of them.

786
01:17:20,049 --> 01:17:23,583
One's lost his parents in a fire,
another's been molested since infancy.

787
01:17:23,648 --> 01:17:26,720
And I empathise, with each
and everyone of them. I do.

788
01:17:26,788 --> 01:17:30,381
But if you would just, just make
an effort to familiarize yourself...

789
01:17:30,531 --> 01:17:32,724
with the history of this
particular child...

790
01:17:32,788 --> 01:17:35,780
I think you would see that
she's in a class of her own.

791
01:17:35,948 --> 01:17:40,446
Oh. So we're interested in
class distinctions, are we?

792
01:17:45,908 --> 01:17:50,116
So, you're not married to Miss Tannen?

793
01:17:50,266 --> 01:17:53,120
We're talking about it. Thank you.

794
01:17:54,088 --> 01:17:56,496
And you're already living together.

795
01:17:56,646 --> 01:17:59,537
Yap, we're living in sin.

796
01:18:04,387 --> 01:18:05,746
Katie.

797
01:18:07,288 --> 01:18:09,324
Katie, don't you wanna see Rob?

798
01:18:10,708 --> 01:18:13,268
Oh, he's dying to see you.

799
01:18:13,428 --> 01:18:15,728
Katie's been hurting herself.

800
01:18:15,778 --> 01:18:18,158
Sh-she does this all the time.

801
01:18:18,228 --> 01:18:20,564
At night, she lies there doing it...

802
01:18:20,713 --> 01:18:22,704
t-till the blood comes out.

803
01:18:23,748 --> 01:18:25,181
Katie, let me see.

804
01:18:26,228 --> 01:18:27,857
Katie, show me.

805
01:18:28,507 --> 01:18:30,034
Where?

806
01:18:30,984 --> 01:18:33,564
Aw... Aw, oh...

807
01:18:51,860 --> 01:18:54,602
Five minutes. It's all I'm asking for.

808
01:18:54,750 --> 01:18:57,063
Five minutes of your time.

809
01:18:58,228 --> 01:19:00,650
I know it was hard on you.

810
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:04,064
I know you and Beverly had to
sacrifice a great deal...

811
01:19:04,128 --> 01:19:06,588
having Katie come and live here with you.

812
01:19:06,648 --> 01:19:11,126
Maybe you don't think I can appreciate
the extent of those sacrifices.

813
01:19:12,288 --> 01:19:15,327
But in my own limited way, I think I can.

814
01:19:16,588 --> 01:19:20,024
So I can understand why
you don't wanna get involved again.

815
01:19:20,188 --> 01:19:24,142
And I wouldn't be asking you,
if I could think of anything else to do.

816
01:19:24,208 --> 01:19:28,123
If I were Sandra Tannen
MD PHD LCSW...

817
01:19:28,328 --> 01:19:32,083
I could walk into that house
and take her straight to the hospital.

818
01:19:32,448 --> 01:19:35,901
But I don't have all those letters
by my name, Norm.

819
01:19:37,908 --> 01:19:40,244
I'm not asking you
to move her back in again.

820
01:19:40,308 --> 01:19:44,501
I just want you to help me stop her
from destroying herself.

821
01:19:45,768 --> 01:19:49,838
If you could just see the extent
of the damage!

822
01:19:50,408 --> 01:19:53,718
Please, help her, Norm.
I'm begging you.

823
01:19:55,188 --> 01:19:57,758
Nobody else'll do it.

824
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,025
Nobody else.

825
01:20:07,908 --> 01:20:11,006
It's just me. It's just me, it's okay.

826
01:20:31,468 --> 01:20:35,210
<i>The second I heard she was living
in an abusive home, I didn't even blink.

827
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:37,950
<i>I got in my car, went over there
and an hour later...

828
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,318
<i>- I checked her into the hospital.
<i>- Well, hooray for you.

829
01:20:41,568 --> 01:20:44,524
Oh! Amanda, this is Sandra Tannen.

830
01:20:44,988 --> 01:20:46,700
Sandra, this is Amanda Black...

831
01:20:46,754 --> 01:20:49,754
from the DSS. She's gonna be
taking over Katie's case.

832
01:20:51,304 --> 01:20:52,887
Nice to meet you.

833
01:20:53,628 --> 01:20:54,900
I understand you were concerned...

834
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,850
about the other two girls
living with the Mannings.

835
01:20:56,900 --> 01:21:00,583
And you'll be happy to know
their cases are under review.

836
01:21:00,828 --> 01:21:04,867
I'd be happier knowing
that they're both outta there.

837
01:21:05,028 --> 01:21:07,029
Well, these things take time.

838
01:21:07,079 --> 01:21:10,850
But, it will be relatively easy
to find new placements for those two.

839
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:11,949
Katie...

840
01:21:12,098 --> 01:21:15,164
well, I'm sure you know that's
a bit more problematic.

841
01:21:15,228 --> 01:21:18,238
We've got to make sure
the situation doesn't reoccur.

842
01:21:18,488 --> 01:21:20,358
Yeah, I'm all for that.

843
01:21:21,548 --> 01:21:25,009
You know, I don't know how
you'll take to this suggestion, but...

844
01:21:25,059 --> 01:21:27,978
how'd you like to have Katie
come live with you?

845
01:21:28,028 --> 01:21:29,664
With me?

846
01:21:30,228 --> 01:21:33,560
From what I understand,
you two have a good relationship...

847
01:21:33,610 --> 01:21:35,183
you've known each other
fairly long time.

848
01:21:35,248 --> 01:21:38,365
You obviously have a good
understanding of Katie's needs.

849
01:21:38,428 --> 01:21:40,940
In fact, we'll probably
never find anyone else who...

850
01:21:40,990 --> 01:21:43,894
understands her nearly so well.

851
01:21:45,248 --> 01:21:47,079
It-it's just that...

852
01:21:47,248 --> 01:21:50,979
She's very demanding, I know,
I know. I realize that.

853
01:21:51,048 --> 01:21:54,143
It's not just her. It's us.

854
01:21:54,308 --> 01:21:57,108
And it's you. How would you ever
find time to finish school...

855
01:21:57,208 --> 01:21:59,284
if you have to look after Katie?

856
01:22:03,148 --> 01:22:05,421
You know, I've thought about all that.

857
01:22:05,688 --> 01:22:10,247
From every practical standpoint,
this is the worst idea I've ever heard.

858
01:22:12,008 --> 01:22:14,761
But you can't help thinking about it.

859
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:23,617
I'm sorry. I must have the wrong room.

860
01:22:24,648 --> 01:22:28,243
- She was moved to another location.
- You mean another hospital?

861
01:22:28,308 --> 01:22:31,061
- I honestly don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?

862
01:22:31,228 --> 01:22:33,960
She was moved this morning
to another location.

863
01:22:34,010 --> 01:22:35,765
That's all the information I have.

864
01:22:36,028 --> 01:22:39,900
Who moved her?
Somebody had to authorize it.

865
01:22:39,950 --> 01:22:43,723
As a matter of fact, she was
accompanied by her mother.

866
01:22:45,308 --> 01:22:47,663
She's not here.

867
01:22:47,828 --> 01:22:51,607
- Do you mind if I ask where she is?
- In a place of my own choosing.

868
01:22:51,668 --> 01:22:54,519
And don't give me any of your nonsense
about what's good for Katie!

869
01:22:54,604 --> 01:22:56,900
You don't know what's good for Katie!
You never did!

870
01:22:56,950 --> 01:23:00,324
Louise, please. I have driven
all the way out here. Could I please...

871
01:23:00,666 --> 01:23:03,966
please just come in and speak to you,
for just a few minutes.

872
01:23:05,287 --> 01:23:06,687
<i>Louise, please.</i>

873
01:23:13,950 --> 01:23:16,500
The way you haunted that child.

874
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:22,777
Don't say it like this, Katie.
Say it like that.

875
01:23:25,208 --> 01:23:28,021
And giving her all those tests?

876
01:23:28,271 --> 01:23:30,978
That's why she couldn't get along
with the Mannings.

877
01:23:32,268 --> 01:23:35,956
You pushed her to a point where she
didn't know which end was up anymore.

878
01:23:36,128 --> 01:23:37,846
Louise, that's not true.

879
01:23:39,958 --> 01:23:43,084
Katie loved the work that we did.

880
01:23:43,148 --> 01:23:49,080
There were days when even I didn't want
to work and she would make me do it.

881
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,405
That's the way you trained her.

882
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:56,743
She was never a person to you.

883
01:23:57,588 --> 01:24:01,183
She was just some little
scientific project.

884
01:24:03,045 --> 01:24:04,145
No.

885
01:24:05,808 --> 01:24:09,720
No. I needed her in my life.

886
01:24:10,188 --> 01:24:13,464
From the first moment that I
laid eyes on her.

887
01:24:13,628 --> 01:24:16,096
Well, you won't be laying
eyes on her anymore.

888
01:24:18,028 --> 01:24:21,179
If I find you anywhere near Katie,
I'm gonna call my lawyer.

889
01:24:21,248 --> 01:24:22,817
And that goes for the Glazers...

890
01:24:22,867 --> 01:24:25,261
and Dr. York and anybody else
from Children's Hospital.

891
01:24:25,428 --> 01:24:27,384
She is my daughter.

892
01:24:28,328 --> 01:24:31,162
I'll decide what's done with her.

893
01:24:34,308 --> 01:24:37,297
She's gonna think that I abandoned her.

894
01:24:39,508 --> 01:24:42,659
Could I please say good-bye?

895
01:24:43,128 --> 01:24:45,268
No good-byes...

896
01:24:45,317 --> 01:24:47,593
no... nothing.

897
01:24:47,988 --> 01:24:52,379
Just go back where you came from
and stay there.

898
01:25:09,933 --> 01:25:11,233
Louise...

899
01:25:11,888 --> 01:25:14,881
there's something I wanted to ask you
from the very beginning...

900
01:25:15,014 --> 01:25:17,014
but I never felt that I should.

901
01:25:20,148 --> 01:25:21,501
Why?

902
01:25:24,368 --> 01:25:27,360
Why did your husband isolate Katie?

903
01:25:29,088 --> 01:25:31,182
I can't tell you that.

904
01:25:31,531 --> 01:25:33,978
<i>You can't or you won't?</i>

905
01:25:34,048 --> 01:25:38,327
How can I tell you something
I don't understand myself?

906
01:25:40,008 --> 01:25:42,044
Nobody understood Wes.

907
01:25:43,588 --> 01:25:45,738
Except maybe his mother.

908
01:25:52,108 --> 01:25:54,403
This was her house.

909
01:25:55,985 --> 01:25:59,085
When Katie was a baby, we would spend
about as much time here...

910
01:25:59,235 --> 01:26:01,401
as we would at our place.

911
01:26:02,368 --> 01:26:05,963
<i>She was like somebody
out of the old West.</i>

912
01:26:06,028 --> 01:26:08,986
<i>She used to run a house
of ill repute.</i>

913
01:26:09,348 --> 01:26:13,182
<i>Even in her old day,
she still packed a pistol.</i>

914
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:16,445
<i>Oh, Wes, he was just wild about her.</i>

915
01:26:16,708 --> 01:26:19,939
<i>I think he cared more about her
than he ever did me.</i>

916
01:26:21,828 --> 01:26:26,504
- She sounds like quite a character.
- Oh, she was.

917
01:26:28,428 --> 01:26:31,261
Wes was never the same after she died.

918
01:26:34,908 --> 01:26:37,741
It happened right outside this door.

919
01:26:38,988 --> 01:26:43,100
<i>She was walking out,
to get an ice-cream...</i>

920
01:26:43,468 --> 01:26:46,301
<i>when this car comes running
right upon her.</i>

921
01:26:49,368 --> 01:26:51,563
Killed instantly, just like that.

922
01:26:51,928 --> 01:26:54,597
And I swear, she wasn't in the ground
more than a week...

923
01:26:54,743 --> 01:26:56,843
then Wes moved us all in here.

924
01:26:58,292 --> 01:27:01,463
<i>Her bedroom, Wes wanted to keep it
just the way it was...</i>

925
01:27:01,513 --> 01:27:03,362
<i>when she was alive.</i>

926
01:27:04,648 --> 01:27:07,421
<i>So, we all had to sleep
in the living-room.</i>

927
01:27:17,148 --> 01:27:21,738
<i>Oh, everybody but Katie.
She had the room in the back.</i>

928
01:27:25,108 --> 01:27:30,136
<i>It was almost like Wes
was giving her something special.

929
01:27:31,308 --> 01:27:33,112
It sounds like he...

930
01:27:33,462 --> 01:27:36,819
like he projected his feelings
for his mother onto Katie.

931
01:27:39,019 --> 01:27:42,483
- I beg your pardon?
- I-I didn't mean to-

932
01:27:44,188 --> 01:27:45,587
Go on.

933
01:27:46,248 --> 01:27:49,664
Well, one day I took Katie to the doctor.

934
01:27:50,314 --> 01:27:53,338
She was sick a lot from
the day she was born.

935
01:27:53,408 --> 01:27:58,402
And this doctor said it looked to him
like she was retarded.

936
01:27:59,468 --> 01:28:02,449
<i>Well, that was it as far as
Wes was concerned.</i>

937
01:28:02,599 --> 01:28:07,538
<i>He said if those doctors got ahold
of her, we'd never get her back.</i>

938
01:28:09,268 --> 01:28:13,147
<i>He said she'd probably wouldn't live
to the age of 3, anyway.</i>

939
01:28:15,568 --> 01:28:18,446
<i>But she just kept getting older...</i>

940
01:28:20,728 --> 01:28:24,680
<i>and I was already starting
to go blind, so Wes...</i>

941
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:27,657
<i>he was the one taking care of her.</i>

942
01:28:28,208 --> 01:28:30,253
<i>I knew she needed help...</i>

943
01:28:31,103 --> 01:28:32,699
but Wes...

944
01:28:34,728 --> 01:28:38,198
He was always walking around with that
pistol his mother left him.

945
01:28:42,588 --> 01:28:45,182
<i>The one he used to kill himself with.</i>

946
01:28:50,248 --> 01:28:53,682
<i>It happened right here in this room.</i>

947
01:28:58,388 --> 01:29:01,522
Sometimes in the middle of the night...

948
01:29:02,508 --> 01:29:04,958
I'd hear the floor settle...

949
01:29:05,988 --> 01:29:08,539
and I could swear it was Wes...

950
01:29:08,889 --> 01:29:11,640
walking around with that pistol
in his belt.

951
01:29:12,788 --> 01:29:15,256
He was trying to protect her...

952
01:29:15,328 --> 01:29:18,798
like she was a princess
locked away in a tower.

953
01:29:20,888 --> 01:29:24,324
Wes never did trust doctors and...

954
01:29:25,468 --> 01:29:29,158
and in that regard, I come around
to his way of thinking.

955
01:30:02,263 --> 01:30:04,063
Hello, Miss Tannen.

956
01:30:06,868 --> 01:30:08,316
So, how long has this been going on?

957
01:30:08,390 --> 01:30:10,390
From the moment that I read
that article of yours.

958
01:30:10,540 --> 01:30:13,538
I thought Katie's mother should know
the kind of people she's dealing with.

959
01:30:13,688 --> 01:30:15,712
But believe me,
I didn't have to say much.

960
01:30:15,862 --> 01:30:18,204
My objections found
very simpathetic ears.

961
01:30:18,368 --> 01:30:22,281
There was nothing wrong with that article!
You were just looking for an excuse!

962
01:30:22,348 --> 01:30:25,306
You didn't care what it was, just as long
as it helped you get Katie back!

963
01:30:25,568 --> 01:30:29,349
And thanks to you I never will.
Poisoning the DSS against me?

964
01:30:29,999 --> 01:30:31,868
Well, who's sorry now?

965
01:30:32,218 --> 01:30:33,682
Hello...

966
01:30:57,908 --> 01:30:59,739
<i>Even after all this time...</i>

967
01:31:00,208 --> 01:31:02,811
<i>I continue to hope that somehow...</i>

968
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:06,336
<i>someway I'll get to see Katie again.</i>

969
01:31:06,628 --> 01:31:10,475
<i>When I think about that possibility,
which is every single day...</i>

970
01:31:10,575 --> 01:31:12,803
<i>I always wonder what I'd say to her.</i>

971
01:31:12,868 --> 01:31:15,940
<i>I know I'd apologize,
for leaving the way I did.</i>

972
01:31:16,190 --> 01:31:19,785
<i>It wasn't my choice,
but I'd apologize just the same...</i>

973
01:31:20,148 --> 01:31:22,587
<i>just so she'd know it wasn't her fault.</i>

974
01:31:22,748 --> 01:31:27,583
<i>And then I'd ask her all about her life,
I'd ask who she sees, what she does...</i>

975
01:31:27,848 --> 01:31:29,799
<i>and whether or not she's happy.</i>

976
01:31:29,849 --> 01:31:33,266
<i>And obviously, I hope she'd tell me yes.</i>

977
01:31:33,428 --> 01:31:36,021
<i>Even if she did, I'd still wish
there was some way...</i>

978
01:31:36,071 --> 01:31:38,741
<i>I could give her back
all the things she lost.</i>

979
01:31:39,108 --> 01:31:42,164
<i>But, I know that isn't possible.</i>

980
01:31:43,308 --> 01:31:48,257
<i>All I can do is concentrate on
those things that are under my control.</i>

981
01:31:48,428 --> 01:31:51,262
<i>And that goes for each
and everyone of us.</i>

982
01:32:00,412 --> 01:32:03,983
<i>Hush little baby, don't say a word...</i>

983
01:32:04,133 --> 01:32:08,081
<i>momma's gonna buy you a mockingbird.</i>

984
01:32:08,230 --> 01:32:11,801
And if that mockingbird don't sing...</i>

985
01:32:12,151 --> 01:32:16,162
<i>momma's gonna buy you a diamond ring.</i>

986
01:32:16,411 --> 01:32:20,013
<i>And if that diamond ring turns brass...</i>

987
01:32:20,941 --> 01:32:24,341
<i>momma's gonna buy you a looking glass.</i>

988
01:32:24,954 --> 01:32:28,454
<i>And if that looking glass gets broke...</i>

989
01:32:28,761 --> 01:32:32,161
<i>momma's gonna buy you a billy goat.</i>

990
01:32:32,515 --> 01:32:35,915
<i>And if that billy goat won't pull...</i>

991
01:32:36,892 --> 01:32:40,292
<i>momma's gonna buy you a cart and bull.</i>

992
01:32:40,580 --> 01:32:43,980
<i>And if that cart and bull turn over...</i>

993
01:32:45,024 --> 01:32:48,424
<i>momma's gonna buy you a dog named Rover.</i>

994
01:32:49,146 --> 01:32:52,746
<i>And if that dog named Rover won't bark...</i>

995
01:32:53,907 --> 01:32:57,407
<i>momma's gonna buy you a horse and cart.</i>

996
01:32:58,238 --> 01:33:01,638
<i>And if that horse and cart fall down...</i>

997
01:33:02,553 --> 01:33:08,653
<i>You'd still be the sweetest
little baby in town.</i>

998
