00:12:57,602 --> 00:12:59,256
I'm sorry, Mr. Mosely.

175
00:12:59,343 --> 00:13:01,519
Can't deviate from policy.

176
00:13:01,606 --> 00:13:05,045
Look, if I go to bed right now
and check out before dawn

177
00:13:05,132 --> 00:13:08,396
then no one will know that you
let me slide on the rules.

178
00:13:08,483 --> 00:13:10,441
I didn't get to be
a management trainee

179
00:13:10,528 --> 00:13:13,270
by breaking rules, Mr. Mosely.

180
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:15,620
I have ethics.

181
00:13:15,707 --> 00:13:19,624
Ethics instilled in me
by a healthy fear of God.

182
00:13:19,711 --> 00:13:21,888
Have a great night, Andy.

Ah.

196
00:14:08,108 --> 00:14:10,980
What the fuck are you doing?

197
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:12,286
Nothing.

198
00:14:23,514 --> 00:14:26,256
And you have the nerve
to call this a Motel 9?

199
00:14:26,343 --> 00:14:28,519
There's no wrapping on one

'There's no bath

But, I...

202
00:14:32,219 --> 00:14:34,917
Don't gimme some excuse like
there's two bars of hand soap.

'Cause there's supposed
to be one of each

Were your accommodations
alright, Sir?

206
00:14:46,146 --> 00:14:48,713
Huh? Oh, yeah, fine.

207
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,715
What do I owe you?

208
00:14:50,802 --> 00:14:52,804
'$21.95.'

209
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,155
Can I get my license
and stuff back?

210
00:14:55,242 --> 00:14:57,026
Pardon me?

211
00:14:57,113 --> 00:15:01,335
Over there, my pink slip,
license, union card.

212
00:15:01,422 --> 00:15:03,641
The guy last night,
took 'em from me.

213

214
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:06,906
Why, um..?

215
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:08,864

217
00:15:13,869 --> 00:15:16,263
Is there a map of Nevada
over there?

[coughing]

219
00:15:18,352 --> 00:15:20,267
Do you have a map of Nevada?

220
00:15:20,354 --> 00:15:22,269
I'm terribly sorry, Sir.

221
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:24,575
We used to have them.
But we ran out.

222
00:15:24,662 --> 00:15:26,142
But I believe they're on order.

223
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:28,623
And I-I think they'll be
in sometime this month.

224

Forget it.

00:15:30,842 --> 00:15:32,540
You know, I'm something
of a gazetteer

226
00:15:32,627 --> 00:15:34,368
when it comes to
the Great Basin.

227
00:15:34,455 --> 00:15:37,327
- Perhaps, I could help.
- What the hell is a gazetteer?

228
00:15:37,414 --> 00:15:39,503
A geographical dictionary.

229
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,809
Oh, really?

230
00:15:40,896 --> 00:15:42,724
You know where El Dorado is?

231
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:45,945
No.

232
00:15:47,294 --> 00:15:49,165
Great.

233
00:15:49,252 --> 00:15:51,472
Well, it's only a hobby.

234
00:15:53,517 --> 00:15:55,345
Oh, he forgot his change.

235
00:15:55,432 --> 00:15:58,087
Hey, I'll give him the change.
I'll give him the change.

236
00:15:58,174 --> 00:16:00,568
I'll give it right to him.

00:16:00,655 --> 00:16:04,311
Hey, I got your
nickel back for you.

238

That's your bike?

241
00:16:12,362 --> 00:16:13,494
Yeah.

242
00:16:14,886 --> 00:16:17,237
Pretty fucking cool, huh?

243
00:16:17,324 --> 00:16:19,848
It's a Harley Davidson, huh?

244
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:21,110
Yeah.

245
00:16:21,197 --> 00:16:23,373
It's-it's classic?

246
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,766
Yeah, it could be.

247
00:16:26,507 --> 00:16:28,117
Does it run good?

248
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:34,167
- Yeah.
- 'Alright.'

- What were you doing?
- What?

251
00:16:48,616 --> 00:16:49,660
Never mind.

Since then, I haven't
done much ridin'.

288
00:18:46,821 --> 00:18:48,866
Hell, I ain't done
any ridin' at all.

289
00:18:48,953 --> 00:18:50,651
I had an old lady.

290
00:18:50,738 --> 00:18:53,741
She used to spit rocks every
time I'd go on a run.

- Where's she now?
- Gone.

- That's a lot of money.
- I heard that.

You know, me and Nelson

00:19:08,451 --> 00:19:11,150
we used to go up to
Pyramid Lake to go fishing.

Of course, I don't do it now.

It's like a Indian name.

00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:21,899
These Cui-uis' are
like prehistoric fish.

I'm not talking about the kind
of fish that's prehistoric

I'm talking about each one
individually, is prehistoric.

'That makes them old.'

305
00:19:30,865 --> 00:19:33,476
And when they get old,
they get big.

306
00:19:33,563 --> 00:19:36,000
And when they get big,
they get feet.

307
00:19:36,087 --> 00:19:38,351
When they get feet,
they get dangerous.

308
00:19:38,438 --> 00:19:43,138
Not only they can swim on water,
they can slide around the top.

Think so? It's pretty
fuckin' cool.

320
00:20:18,391 --> 00:20:20,306
What do I owe you
for the beer?

321
00:20:20,393 --> 00:20:23,483
No, forget it.
Just keep riding.

322
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:24,919
Alright.

323
00:20:25,006 --> 00:20:26,834
You think I could
ride with you?

324
00:20:28,401 --> 00:20:30,229
It's a free road.

325
00:20:48,464 --> 00:20:50,292
- See you.
- Wait-wait up.

326
00:20:54,035 --> 00:20:55,079
Wait.

[instrumental music]

328
00:21:16,013 --> 00:21:18,189
I wasn't too sure
about this bike.

329
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:23,673
You know? I mean it looks
kind of fucked up.

330
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,635
It's not all sturdy like yours,
but it's tight man, it's tight.

331
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,293
Yay! That is great.

It is perfect.

Fuck!

337
00:22:11,068 --> 00:22:12,331
Hey.

338
00:22:13,157 --> 00:22:14,550
What's wrong?

339
00:22:14,637 --> 00:22:16,030
Nothing.

340
00:22:16,117 --> 00:22:17,684
Why did you stop?

341
00:22:19,512 --> 00:22:21,427

No.

I got some tools.

344
00:22:25,692 --> 00:22:28,651
Guy who sold me the bike threw
in some wrenches and stuff.

345
00:22:28,738 --> 00:22:30,610
Look, I got wrenches.

346
00:22:30,697 --> 00:22:32,220
Then what's wrong?

347
00:22:32,307 --> 00:22:34,831
I need a ribbon.

to El Dorado, huh?

Yeah, if I get there.

351
00:22:47,278 --> 00:22:50,717
What's it to you anyway?

352
00:22:50,804 --> 00:22:53,633
I don't know, I just..
We're out here. I figured.

353
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,374
You don't have
to hang around...

354
00:22:55,461 --> 00:22:58,028
I'm not gonna leave you
in the middle of nowhere.

355
00:22:58,115 --> 00:22:59,943
Are you followin' me?

356
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:03,338
You're not going anywhere.

357
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:06,863
Yeah, but first, you're on
the roof outside my apartment.

358
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,909
Then you're at
the same motel as me.

359
00:23:08,996 --> 00:23:10,954
And now you show up
with this bike.

360
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:13,217
This bike was
a great deal, 500 bucks

361
00:23:13,304 --> 00:23:16,264
and the guy threw in a set
of wrenches and this jacket

362
00:23:16,351 --> 00:23:17,308
helmet and everything.

363
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,398
Oh, yeah, what about the motels?

364
00:23:19,485 --> 00:23:22,705
I always stay at Motel 9,
I figured you were into 'em too.

365
00:23:22,792 --> 00:23:24,098
Really.

366
00:23:26,274 --> 00:23:29,886
Aright, look, I was
kind of following you.

367
00:23:29,973 --> 00:23:33,281
I don't know much about bikes,
I figured you could help me out.

368
00:23:33,368 --> 00:23:35,283
You know, if something
goes wrong.

369
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:38,765
It's kind of funny that yours
is the one that broke down.

370
00:23:38,852 --> 00:23:39,809
Yeah.

371
00:23:39,896 --> 00:23:42,116
Hey, could I get one?

372
00:23:42,203 --> 00:23:44,074
'Can I smoke?'

373
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,774
Thanks.

374
00:23:49,776 --> 00:23:53,301
Yeah, started smoking
when I was seven.

375
00:23:53,388 --> 00:23:56,173
Never buy 'em though.

376
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,132
'When did you start?'

377
00:24:01,744 --> 00:24:05,226
Pretty worried about
your bike, huh?

378
00:24:05,313 --> 00:24:07,837
I'm worried about being
on the middle of a desert

379
00:24:07,924 --> 00:24:09,839
with somebody who doesn't
have his own cigarettes.

380
00:24:15,802 --> 00:24:17,194
Okay.

381
00:24:23,331 --> 00:24:26,639
I'll just save it for later.

382
00:24:26,726 --> 00:24:28,902
Ya, do that.

383
00:24:40,174 --> 00:24:41,567
Hey.

384
00:24:41,654 --> 00:24:43,003
[whistling]

385
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:46,746
Hey, it's gonna stop, Joe.

386
00:24:56,669 --> 00:24:58,322
Lovely day.

387
00:24:58,409 --> 00:25:01,674
A bit warm though to be sitting
in the middle of the desert.

388
00:25:01,761 --> 00:25:04,590
- I know, my friend broke down.
- Maybe I can help.

389
00:25:04,677 --> 00:25:06,374
Yeah, uh..

390
00:25:06,461 --> 00:25:08,724
- What do you need?
- Eighth-inch rivet.

391
00:25:08,811 --> 00:25:11,553
Yeah, he needs an
eighth-inch rivet.

392
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,991
Well, I got a lot of fixing
paraphernalia back in my place.

393
00:25:15,078 --> 00:25:16,732
You got any beer?

394
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:19,692
- I have some Cristal.
- Wow, speed?

395
00:25:20,823 --> 00:25:22,956
- Champagne.
- Oh.

396
00:25:24,871 --> 00:25:28,004
Speed kills, or worse.

397
00:25:28,091 --> 00:25:30,485
It makes you psychotic.

398
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:33,357
You got it?

399
00:25:33,444 --> 00:25:35,751
People love it, because
it makes them feel

400
00:25:35,838 --> 00:25:38,841
they're in control
of their destiny.

401
00:25:38,928 --> 00:25:42,149
What you oughta be on a look out
for is transcendent reality.

402
00:25:42,236 --> 00:25:45,456
Seeing in and seeing out.

403
00:25:50,026 --> 00:25:51,724
Okay, push it up here.

404
00:25:51,811 --> 00:25:53,073
'Okay.'

405
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,857
[both grunting]

406
00:25:56,903 --> 00:25:58,469
Speed kills.

407
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:01,037
[Joe]
'You know where a place
called El Dorado is?'

408
00:26:01,124 --> 00:26:03,823
[male #5]
'There's an El Dorado Canyon
up near Mt. Charleston.'

409
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:05,172
[Joe]
'Oh, great.'

410
00:26:05,259 --> 00:26:06,956
'I'll ride back here
with the bike.'

411
00:26:11,047 --> 00:26:12,527
See ya.

412
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,703
Forget it.

413
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:17,314
I'm not leaving you alone
with that guy, he's nuts.

414
00:26:18,968 --> 00:26:20,187
I'm fine man.

415
00:26:20,274 --> 00:26:21,797
I'm telling you,
the guy's insane.

416
00:26:21,884 --> 00:26:24,974
Look, how slow he's driving.
Fucking crazy.

417
00:26:25,061 --> 00:26:26,410
Just get lost, will you?

418
00:26:26,497 --> 00:26:28,543
No way, I'll make sure
you're alright.

419
00:26:38,118 --> 00:26:39,380
Joe, wait up.

420
00:26:53,524 --> 00:26:56,876
[Sam]
'It's cool, that crazy guy knew
where El Dorado is, huh?'

421
00:26:56,963 --> 00:26:59,400
- 'Yeah.'
- 'Mountain dew, alright.'

422
00:26:59,487 --> 00:27:03,056
Man, I haven't had one of these
since I was like six years old.

423
00:27:03,143 --> 00:27:04,840
I had this friend Corky.

424
00:27:04,927 --> 00:27:07,147
And he used to drink
'em all the time.

425
00:27:07,234 --> 00:27:09,366
'He said it improved
his burping.'

426
00:27:09,453 --> 00:27:11,586
Anyway, he had this sister.

427
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:13,893
And every day, man,
she was such a bitch.

428
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,156
She'd come home after school
everyday and take his

429
00:27:16,243 --> 00:27:17,461
afterschool snack.

430
00:27:17,548 --> 00:27:19,246
- A Marlboro box, please.
- Okay.

431
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:23,337
Anyway, um, his snacks
were usually like, um..

432
00:27:23,424 --> 00:27:25,513
waffles or something,
you know?

433
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,515
But, do you always
smoke Marlboros?

434
00:27:27,602 --> 00:27:29,822
Yeah, can I get a pack
of Marlboro's, please?

435
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:34,740
Could I get two packs, hard
packs of Marlboro's, please?

436
00:27:34,827 --> 00:27:36,219
- On me.
- Two pack?

437
00:27:47,404 --> 00:27:48,928
You always smoke the hard pack?

438
00:27:49,015 --> 00:27:51,017
'Cause I think you're
supposed to get

439
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:52,714
more tobacco from
the soft pack.

440
00:27:52,801 --> 00:27:54,498
'Cause they cut 'em.

441
00:27:54,585 --> 00:27:57,588
I mean, they make then shorter
so they can close the lid.

442
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:00,026
Of the hard pack, I mean.

443
00:28:00,113 --> 00:28:03,899
You know, 'cause they're suppose
to fall out of the soft pack

444
00:28:03,986 --> 00:28:04,987
a lot easier.

445
00:28:09,165 --> 00:28:11,080
- Do you want anything else?
- Uh, no, thanks.

446
00:28:11,167 --> 00:28:12,473
You sure?

447
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,389
We got chicken fried steak
on special today.

448
00:28:15,476 --> 00:28:17,696
- This is fine.
- Okay.

449

451
00:28:33,015 --> 00:28:34,582
- 'What are you doing?'
- 'What's that?'

452
00:28:34,669 --> 00:28:36,845
[Sam]
'Help. Ah, help me'

453
00:28:38,151 --> 00:28:39,674
[Sam]
'What are you doing?'

454
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:42,372
You just stay right there boy,
don't you move it.

455
00:28:42,459 --> 00:28:44,244
- I didn't do anything.
- Shit.

456
00:28:44,331 --> 00:28:45,636
[Sam]
'Ah, help.'

457
00:28:47,682 --> 00:28:49,771
You're hurting me,
I didn't do anything.

458
00:28:49,858 --> 00:28:52,034
When was the last time
you passed through here?

459
00:28:52,121 --> 00:28:54,080
I never been here before
my entire life.

460
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:55,690
Don't bullshit me.

461
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:58,998
Uh, maybe, I went to, uh,
I took a bus to see my

462
00:28:59,085 --> 00:29:01,000
Grandma Mooney in Wisconsin.

463
00:29:01,087 --> 00:29:02,610
Joe, help me.

464
00:29:02,697 --> 00:29:04,960
Officer, let him off.
He's not hurting anyone.

465
00:29:05,047 --> 00:29:06,701
Well, he could be.

466
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:10,487
He bears a sinister resemblance
to a vicious criminal

467
00:29:10,574 --> 00:29:12,054
that's been around
in our area.

468
00:29:12,141 --> 00:29:14,840
And since when is it a crime
to look like somebody?

469

'Yeah, what the guy do anyway?'

- What?
- Huh?

Dine and dash.

473
00:29:25,198 --> 00:29:27,635
I'm gonna let you go with
a warning this time.

474
00:29:27,722 --> 00:29:29,855
He didn't do anything.

[gun barrel clicking]

476
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:34,381
You don't realize what's
happening, do you?

477
00:29:34,468 --> 00:29:36,949
'Cause if you did, you'd be
shitting in your shoes.

478
00:29:37,036 --> 00:29:38,994
Wouldn't you be
quaking with fear?

479
00:29:39,081 --> 00:29:41,301
I want you to look around,
just look around.

480
00:29:41,388 --> 00:29:43,172
Tell me what you see?

481
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:47,829
A whole society that's obsessed
with feeling good and happy.

482
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:50,963
But underneath
that moronic veneer

483
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:53,356
lurks a thirst for blood.

484
00:29:53,443 --> 00:29:55,054
Yes, my friend.

485
00:29:55,141 --> 00:29:57,621
An invidious potential..

...lawlessness...and despair.

487
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:04,585
Existential and otherwise.

488

The sooner you weasels
open your eyes

489
00:30:08,632 --> 00:30:10,199
to the hideous truth.

'The sooner you wish
you were dead.'

- 'That guy is insane.'
- 'Let's get outta here.'

wear a helmet?

493
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:23,430

wouldn't rather hit

a Burger King or something?

503

- No, this place is cool.
- Hey, hey, cool cats.

- Hi, I bet you're a wild one.
- Uh, no.

507
00:31:49,864 --> 00:31:52,301
They had a lot of places
like this in 50's?

508

Oh, yeah.

509
00:31:54,042 --> 00:31:56,479
Everyday after nursery school
I just hop on my tricycle.

Goin' down to Muscle Beach

511
00:31:57,872 --> 00:32:01,180
and have milk
and cookies with Elvis.

512
00:32:01,267 --> 00:32:02,616

Uh, chef salad, diet plate,
decaf coffee.

524

'What? No way.'

No way am I riding on the back
of someone's god damn bike.

880
00:56:28,646 --> 00:56:30,691
- Not even yours, Joe.
- Don't be stupid.

881
00:56:30,778 --> 00:56:34,521
I would rather walk and crawl
through this burning desert

882
00:56:34,608 --> 00:56:37,655
on my bleeding
and torn knees.

883

No.

Hey. Hey,
I need some help.

893
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,910
Is there a machine shop,
around here?

894
00:58:01,129 --> 00:58:02,914
Hey.

895
00:58:03,001 --> 00:58:06,221
- Hey, wanna go to a meeting?
- Huh?

896
00:58:06,308 --> 00:58:09,224
A very happening one,
not far from here. Come on.

897
00:58:09,311 --> 00:58:11,792
So, all the cappuccino,
you can drink.

898
00:58:11,879 --> 00:58:15,317
Lot of famous Hollywood
celebrities go there. Come on.

899
00:58:15,404 --> 00:58:17,102
One step at a time.

'I've been there.
We all have.'

902
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:28,896
Start out, you roll
through a few stop signs.

903
00:58:28,983 --> 00:58:30,898
Remember Billy Idol.

904
00:58:30,985 --> 00:58:32,465
'Next thing you know'

'you're making lane
changes without signal.'

906
00:58:34,859 --> 00:58:37,296
Then you fall in
with bad company.

907
00:58:37,383 --> 00:58:40,647
Bunch of shiftless punks who got
no respect for the speed limit.

'One day your hay-fever
is acting up on you.'

909
00:58:44,042 --> 00:58:45,957
So, you take
an antihistamine.

910
00:58:46,044 --> 00:58:48,568
Get on your bike,
don't even think about it.

But you're ridin'
under the influence.

912
00:58:51,092 --> 00:58:52,746
You bottomed out.

Welcome to Oscar's house

What will it be?

919
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:43,231
Uh, my friend here could use
a shifter for his bike.

920
00:59:43,318 --> 00:59:45,190
Got one right here.

921
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:52,110
Wow.

922
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:56,941
- Is this a dream?
- If you believe in nightmares.

'Joe, I should go
I think.'

Oh, do not mind him.
It's called gallows humor.

925
01:00:02,642 --> 01:00:04,513
Yeah, but it isn't funny.

926
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:08,996
Only, if you're in love
and waiting to die.

This is my wife, Celeste.

I was a secretary
in an insurance office.

When I found out
I was gonna die young

942
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:54,346
I figured,
I got nothing to lose

943
01:00:54,433 --> 01:00:56,609
so ...broke into operations
at the test site.

944

Test site?

945

Where they test
all the nuclear warheads.

946

You must've driven
right past it.

You've got
some sauce on you.

948

Anyway, I was
really pissed off

949
01:01:06,097 --> 01:01:09,666
they were spending more money
to make people sick than well.

950
01:01:09,753 --> 01:01:14,932

myself to the controls.

from the test site.

955
01:01:24,942 --> 01:01:27,466
I was dying the minute
I was born.

take it off for?

still be open here.

Death is the answer
for a lot of people.

- Answer to what?
- Whatever they're looking for.

1043

Mostly, it's about love.

01:29:26,491 --> 01:29:28,145
$15,000?

1388
01:29:28,232 --> 01:29:31,366
Hey, brain washing's
expensive these days.

1389
01:29:31,453 --> 01:29:34,064
Bummer was, that was supposed
to be my college fund.

1390

[vehicle approaching]

1391
01:29:37,894 --> 01:29:40,766
- I'd better get going.
- So, where are you going?

1392
01:29:40,853 --> 01:29:44,857
Well, where I really
wanna go is Haiti.

1393
01:29:44,944 --> 01:29:46,946
There's more under-educated
people there than anywhere else

1394
01:29:47,033 --> 01:29:49,340
in this hemisphere.
Except for maybe here.

1395
01:29:49,427 --> 01:29:51,908
I figure I could teach kids
to read or something.

1396
01:29:51,995 --> 01:29:55,215
'But it'll be hard to get a
visa, plane ticket or anything''

1397
01:29:55,302 --> 01:29:58,305
So, I figured I'd hitch up
to Alaska and watch sea otters.

1398
01:29:58,393 --> 01:30:01,657
It's turning into one big
oil swamp up there.

1399
01:30:01,744 --> 01:30:03,485
Where you guys headed?

1400
01:30:03,572 --> 01:30:05,574
- Back to LA.
- What for?

1401
01:30:05,661 --> 01:30:08,751
Well, I gotta try to get my job
back. Get another motorcycle.

1402
01:30:08,838 --> 01:30:11,144
Oh, I'm thinking of getting
into Psychotherapy.

1403
01:30:11,231 --> 01:30:13,582
Later.

1404
01:30:13,669 --> 01:30:16,149
So, what's wrong with that?

1405
01:30:16,236 --> 01:30:18,587
You're just a couple of
self-indulgent pussies

1406
01:30:18,674 --> 01:30:20,980
burrowing into your own
stupid, little cocoons.

1407
01:30:21,067 --> 01:30:23,418
You probably love that
"Don't worry be happy" song.

1408
01:30:23,505 --> 01:30:25,420
I hated that song.

1409
01:30:25,507 --> 01:30:27,334
There's a whole world
changing out there.

1410
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:29,685
I guess if you wanna
die in the vine

1411
01:30:29,772 --> 01:30:31,991
with the Empire in decline,
it's up to you.

1412
01:30:34,733 --> 01:30:36,909
She shouldn't be hitch-hiking
you know.

1413
01:30:36,996 --> 01:30:38,737
She's so young and...

1414
01:30:38,824 --> 01:30:40,478
Insane?

1415
01:30:40,565 --> 01:30:42,741
No...smart.

1416
01:30:45,004 --> 01:30:46,963
Hey, wait.
Wait up.

1417
01:30:48,530 --> 01:30:50,270
'Comin'?'

1418
01:30:50,357 --> 01:30:51,315
Nah.

1419
01:30:55,406 --> 01:30:57,277
Gonna miss you, Joe.

1420
01:30:58,801 --> 01:31:01,891
Yeah, don't worry
about it, man.

1421
01:31:03,849 --> 01:31:06,025
I'll call you
when we get somewhere.

1422
01:31:10,290 --> 01:31:12,423
You can't call me.

1423
01:31:14,556 --> 01:31:16,514
You don't know
my last name.

1424
01:32:16,574 --> 01:32:18,315
Where you headed?

1425
01:32:18,402 --> 01:32:21,187
Idaho, maybe Alaska.
