200
00:14:59,488 --> 00:15:00,338

(feet crunching)

202
00:15:10,898 --> 00:15:13,206

203
00:15:14,776 --> 00:15:19,776
(dramatic music)
(dogs barking)

204

00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:37,448
I'm huntin' for a Miss Amelia Evans.

207
00:15:37,448 --> 00:15:38,281
- How come?

208
00:15:39,618 --> 00:15:40,918

209
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,838
(dramatic music)

210
00:15:44,838 --> 00:15:47,711
- That's me. How'd you mean kin?

211
00:15:48,856 --> 00:15:51,818
- (pants) Because my
mother was Fanny Jessup.

212
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:53,721
She come from Chehaw,
and I remember hear tell

213
00:15:55,048 --> 00:15:57,808
that she had a half sister
named Martha.

214
00:15:57,808 --> 00:16:01,488
And back in Chehaw today, they
tell me she was your mother.

215
00:16:01,488 --> 00:16:04,068
And if Fanny Jessup and
Martha were half sisters,

216
00:16:04,068 --> 00:16:06,968
and I'm the son of the
third husband of Fanny,

217
00:16:06,968 --> 00:16:08,471
that means well, here.

218
00:16:10,568 --> 00:16:13,498
I have a picture

219
00:16:22,018 --> 00:16:24,891
of my mother and her half sister.

220
00:16:27,448 --> 00:16:29,261
- This could be any old picture.

221
00:16:32,728 --> 00:16:33,731

223
00:16:51,328 --> 00:16:52,578
- Where do you come from?

224
00:16:54,126 --> 00:16:55,626
- I was travelin'

225
00:16:57,856 --> 00:17:00,438

226
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,818
- Sho' is a cry baby.

227
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,966

00:18:10,566 --> 00:18:12,483
I don't know your name.

233
00:18:13,915 --> 00:18:15,498

234
00:18:21,486 --> 00:18:24,723
- Well, there's supper in the stove.

235
00:18:24,723 --> 00:18:26,473
Come in, you can eat.

00:18:30,803 --> 00:18:33,471
(feet trudging)

237
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:55,731

(gentle music continues)

246
00:19:54,716 --> 00:19:57,550
- Don't turn off the lamp, Amelia.

247
00:20:00,293 --> 00:20:02,876
(gentle music)

248
00:20:06,218 --> 00:20:07,886
Leave the door open, please.

249
00:20:09,815 --> 00:20:12,398
(gentle music)

250
00:20:25,948 --> 00:20:27,478
- There she is.

251
00:20:27,478 --> 00:20:29,858
She's washin' her head under the pump.

252
00:20:29,858 --> 00:20:32,348
- So? She does that every mornin'

253
00:20:32,348 --> 00:20:35,726
- Is this brokeback, he
claimed kin with her?

254
00:20:35,726 --> 00:20:36,798
With Miss Amelia?

255
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:39,338
- He did. Said he was her cousin.

256
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,141
His mother and her's were sisters.

257
00:20:42,088 --> 00:20:43,476
- I don't see no brokeback.

258
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:44,310
- Well maybe he left.

259
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,468
Maybe she threw 'em out.
How do I know?

260
00:20:47,476 --> 00:20:48,478
Now where's my pail?

261
00:20:48,478 --> 00:20:50,748
- Oh, she's goin' back in the house.

262
00:20:50,748 --> 00:20:51,598
What's she doin'?

263
00:20:52,488 --> 00:20:54,778
Are you sure you saw
this here brokeback?

264
00:20:54,778 --> 00:20:55,788
How much liquor you had?

265
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:56,628
You just been seein' things?

266
00:20:56,628 --> 00:20:58,758
- Weren't just me saw him.

267
00:20:58,758 --> 00:20:59,828
He was there alright.

268
00:20:59,828 --> 00:21:02,748
Just like I said, and
carryin' this old suitcase,

269
00:21:02,748 --> 00:21:04,068
tied up in rope.

270
00:21:04,068 --> 00:21:06,028
They went in the house together.

271
00:21:06,028 --> 00:21:08,278
- Then where is he?
What's she done with him?

272
00:21:10,796 --> 00:21:11,776
- What was he doin' up there?

273
00:21:11,776 --> 00:21:12,616
- Well I don't know.

274
00:21:12,616 --> 00:21:13,528
- Have you seen him?

275
00:21:13,528 --> 00:21:15,033

276
00:21:15,033 --> 00:21:15,956
Oh, shh.

278
00:21:18,206 --> 00:21:20,986
(horse clopping)

279
00:21:20,986 --> 00:21:23,976
- Ya ask me, all that business
'bout kin was trumped up.

280
00:21:23,976 --> 00:21:24,906
- Takin' that creature-
- Ya ask me,

281
00:21:24,906 --> 00:21:26,326
Amelia got no kin.

282
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,906

283
00:21:28,906 --> 00:21:31,873

(men chattering)

286
00:21:37,531 --> 00:21:39,036
- I wonder where in the hell he is.

287
00:21:39,036 --> 00:21:40,271
- I can't say.

288
00:21:40,271 --> 00:21:42,888
- Hey, I know what Miss Amelia done.

289
00:21:42,888 --> 00:21:44,778
I said, I know what Miss Amelia done.

290
00:21:44,778 --> 00:21:46,798
- Yeah? What's she done, Merlie?

291
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:49,548
- She murdered that man for
somethin' in that suitcase.

292
00:21:50,428 --> 00:21:51,918
- Miss Amelia would not kill anyone

293
00:21:51,918 --> 00:21:54,116
for just a few pieces of junk.

294
00:21:54,116 --> 00:21:55,578
- Well how you know it's junk, huh?

295
00:21:55,578 --> 00:21:56,488
How do you know?

296
00:21:56,488 --> 00:21:58,348
- So what's she done with the body?

297
00:21:58,348 --> 00:22:00,328
What's she done with it?

298
00:22:00,328 --> 00:22:02,018
- She chopped him up and
buried him in the swamp,

299
00:22:02,018 --> 00:22:03,188
that's what she done.

300
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,558
- Murdered?
- That brokeback?

301
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:07,248
- He's buried in the swamp.

302
00:22:07,248 --> 00:22:08,648
- Well, if she has kilt him,

303
00:22:09,598 --> 00:22:10,788
they'll come and arrest her.

304
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:12,716
- You're crazy.

305
00:22:12,716 --> 00:22:14,778
- No, I ain't! I ain't crazy.

306
00:22:14,778 --> 00:22:16,798
- Miss Amelia has murdered him.

307
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:18,698
- They will take her to Atlanta.

308
00:22:18,698 --> 00:22:19,766
- They will electrocute her.

309
00:22:19,766 --> 00:22:22,601
- It's wild and foolish
talk that you're doin' here.

310
00:22:23,526 --> 00:22:26,038
And it does none of ya,
none of ya, any credit.

311
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:27,655
- Where is he, Reverend Willin?

312
00:22:27,655 --> 00:22:29,416
- Good question.
- Come on!

313
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:30,948

323
00:23:46,201 --> 00:23:49,508
- Why that's Miss Amelia's snuff box.

324
00:23:49,508 --> 00:23:51,458
That belonged to her daddy.

325
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:52,341

328
00:24:01,718 --> 00:24:03,858

329
00:24:03,858 --> 00:24:05,038
Where you from?

330
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:06,111

He don't mean no harm.

333
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:13,798
He's got three-day malaria.

334
00:24:13,798 --> 00:24:15,138
- Merlie, go fetch those ladies
in here.

335
00:24:15,138 --> 00:24:16,288
They're gonna hurt their noses

336
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,218

- We got to go.

367
00:26:11,975 --> 00:26:14,055
- Well go ahead
and stay a little while.

368
00:26:14,055 --> 00:26:16,741
(people chattering)

369
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:17,658
Good night.

370
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:21,188
It was a pleasure havin'
ya, don't be a stranger.

371
00:26:21,188 --> 00:26:24,496
See y'all.
(people chattering)

372
00:26:24,496 --> 00:26:27,753
Hey Edith, good night.
It's been a pleasure.

373
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,656

374
00:26:29,656 --> 00:26:30,820

375
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,308
(laughs) Good night, don't
let the bedbugs bite, Harlan.

376
00:26:33,308 --> 00:26:36,391
(people chattering)

377
00:26:37,486 --> 00:26:39,788
Good night.
It's been a pleasure ladies.

378
00:26:39,788 --> 00:26:43,705

379

(dog barking)

385
00:27:12,326 --> 00:27:15,638
- I remember when my
Big Papa was alive.

386
00:27:15,638 --> 00:27:18,726
Ah, those days I slept.

387
00:27:18,726 --> 00:27:22,888
I'd go away just as the lamp
was turned on, and I'd sleep.

388
00:27:22,888 --> 00:27:27,078
I slept like I was drownin'
in more mounds of grease.

389
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:27,911
And then Big Papa'd walk in,

390
00:27:27,911 --> 00:27:29,446
and he'd put his hand on my shoulder,

391
00:27:29,446 --> 00:27:32,353
"Get stirrin', Little," he'd say.

392
00:27:32,353 --> 00:27:33,906
- He called you Little?

393
00:27:33,906 --> 00:27:37,028
- Yeah, and then he'd holler
up the stairs from the kitchen

394
00:27:37,028 --> 00:27:38,205
while the stove was hot!

395
00:27:38,205 --> 00:27:40,118
(clock chimes)

396
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:45,111
It's 3:00. "Fried grits," he'd yell!

397
00:27:46,158 --> 00:27:48,788
White meat and gravy, ham and eggs!

398
00:27:48,788 --> 00:27:49,898
And I'd rush down the stairs,

399
00:27:49,898 --> 00:27:51,448
and I'd get my clothes by the stove

400
00:27:51,448 --> 00:27:53,148
while he'd be washin' out by the pump.

401
00:27:53,148 --> 00:27:54,978
And then off we'd go to the still.

402
00:27:54,978 --> 00:27:57,761
- Those grits we had
this mornin' was poor.

403
00:27:58,853 --> 00:28:02,826
Fried so quick that the
insides never heated.

404
00:28:02,826 --> 00:28:06,928
- Mm-hmm, when Big Papa
used to run off the liquor,

405
00:28:06,928 --> 00:28:10,826
in those days, why you just never saw.

406
00:28:10,826 --> 00:28:13,576

408
00:28:20,328 --> 00:28:22,391
What is it that ails ya, Cousin Lymon?

409
00:28:27,648 --> 00:28:29,848
You want me to rub some
liquor on your back?

410
00:28:31,363 --> 00:28:34,488
- No.
(fire crackling)

411
00:28:34,488 --> 00:28:35,988
- What is it then?

412
00:28:37,928 --> 00:28:40,761
- I just don't like the nighttime.

413
00:28:41,658 --> 00:28:44,871
I don't like starin' into
the dark, that's all.

414
00:28:48,356 --> 00:28:52,385

tell ya we were destroyed.

422
00:29:33,108 --> 00:29:35,168
It was terrible.

423
00:29:35,168 --> 00:29:36,681
Never had it so bad.

424
00:29:39,768 --> 00:29:41,148
Mornin'

425
00:29:41,148 --> 00:29:43,598

426
00:29:43,598 --> 00:29:45,751
- This here is my cousin.
This is Lymon Willis.

427
00:29:45,751 --> 00:29:47,378
This is Jack.

428
00:29:47,378 --> 00:29:49,178
- Pleased to meet ya.

429
00:29:49,178 --> 00:29:50,765
- At your service, sir.

430
00:29:50,765 --> 00:29:52,248
- Amelia?

431
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:54,388
That nigger boy there's sloughin'

432
00:29:54,388 --> 00:29:58,763
He's lollygaggin' Ain't
no lollygaggin' now!

(gun blasts)

438
00:30:45,876 --> 00:30:46,710
- Whoo!

439
00:30:49,636 --> 00:30:52,136

440
00:30:56,811 --> 00:31:00,295

00:31:03,151 --> 00:31:05,021
19, twine, (claps) 19.

443
00:31:07,428 --> 00:31:08,888
Corn, pine.
- Amelia.

444
00:31:09,986 --> 00:31:10,951
You know what?

445
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,498
Get some tables in here.

446
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:17,198
- Tables. Cousin Lymon, whatever for?

447
00:31:17,198 --> 00:31:20,188
- So folks could sit down to drink.

448
00:31:20,188 --> 00:31:22,186
- Why do they need to sit down?

449
00:31:22,186 --> 00:31:26,098
- Oh man, Amelia, you can
make those tables yourself.

450
00:31:26,098 --> 00:31:28,338
Look, you could clear out a space.

451
00:31:28,338 --> 00:31:30,978
And then we could have
company every night.

452
00:31:30,978 --> 00:31:32,548
You know I like company.

453
00:31:32,548 --> 00:31:34,368
You know that, Amelia.

454
00:31:34,368 --> 00:31:36,488
- Yeah, but-
- And you can start

455
00:31:36,488 --> 00:31:38,128
sellin' liquor by the glass!

456
00:31:38,128 --> 00:31:40,018
Make more money that way.

457
00:31:40,018 --> 00:31:42,878
And we could brin' that
piano in from outside.

458
00:31:42,878 --> 00:31:45,071
- Well that piano ain't
been used since my ma died.

459
00:31:45,071 --> 00:31:47,298
- That piano would liven
things up, Amelia.

460
00:31:47,298 --> 00:31:49,461
The piano would liven things up!

Well, come on in.

I told you this here's a cafe.

472
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:29,185

I'm so pleased to see you

486
00:33:29,688 --> 00:33:30,908

487
00:33:31,868 --> 00:33:33,971

She's wearin' a scarlet dress.

500
00:34:12,443 --> 00:34:14,143
Y'all know what that means.

501
00:34:14,143 --> 00:34:15,543
She's livin' in sin.

502
00:34:15,543 --> 00:34:17,023
She's livin' in sin
with that brokeback!

503
00:34:17,023 --> 00:34:20,155
That's what it means.

504

You're writin' a story. What about?

512
00:34:50,353 --> 00:34:52,628
- Ah, ah, I don't want you
to see it yet.

513
00:34:52,628 --> 00:34:54,288
- Why not?

514
00:34:54,288 --> 00:34:55,821
What's it about? Tell me.

515
00:34:57,918 --> 00:34:59,068
- It's about foreigners

516
00:35:00,828 --> 00:35:04,058
and trapdoors, and

517
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:07,593
millions of dollars.

518
00:35:07,593 --> 00:35:09,921
- (laughs) Wow. Millions of dollars?

519
00:35:11,098 --> 00:35:12,598
What else?

520
00:35:12,598 --> 00:35:14,318
- I ain't decided yet.

521
00:35:14,318 --> 00:35:16,271
- I like stories
with gangsters in 'em.

522
00:35:16,271 --> 00:35:17,428
(paper rustling)
You got gangsters

523
00:35:17,428 --> 00:35:18,521

524
00:35:20,475 --> 00:35:24,798
Mm?

00:35:24,798 --> 00:35:27,506

527
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:39,246

- $75.
(Lymon gasps)

529
00:35:40,956 --> 00:35:42,206
- 75?
- 75 even.

530
00:35:44,258 --> 00:35:45,318
- What is it?

531
00:35:45,318 --> 00:35:47,138
- Cousin Lymon, it's a car.

532
00:35:47,138 --> 00:35:48,898
I bought it for you.

533
00:35:48,898 --> 00:35:50,468
- I wanna drive it.

534
00:35:50,468 --> 00:35:54,015
I ain't never driven
a car before! (laughs)

536
00:35:54,848 --> 00:35:56,208
- You can't, Cousin Lymon.

537
00:35:56,208 --> 00:35:58,438
- You can!
(upbeat fiddle music)

538
00:35:58,438 --> 00:35:59,823
Let's go to Chehaw.

539
00:35:59,823 --> 00:36:01,328
- [Amelia] Whatever for?

540
00:36:01,328 --> 00:36:02,885
- We could go to the pitcher show.

541
00:36:02,885 --> 00:36:04,168
- Whatever for?

542
00:36:04,168 --> 00:36:06,068
- [Lymon] It would be fun!

543
00:36:06,068 --> 00:36:10,250
- Ah!

Whoo-hoo, Chehaw,

00:36:27,606 --> 00:36:28,955
Two for the picture show.

550
00:36:28,955 --> 00:36:30,238
- Upstairs or downstairs?

551
00:36:30,238 --> 00:36:31,478
- Upstairs.
- What?

552
00:36:31,478 --> 00:36:33,311
- We'd like upstairs.
- That'll be 30 cents.

553
00:36:34,248 --> 00:36:35,198
- [Narrator] The democratic candidate

554
00:36:35,198 --> 00:36:36,918
has spoken forcefully and insistently

555
00:36:36,918 --> 00:36:40,818
of the need for a change, a New Deal.

556
00:36:40,818 --> 00:36:44,666
And on election day, Franklin
Delano Roosevelt is confident.

557
00:36:46,216 --> 00:36:48,800
(upbeat music)

558
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:52,566

00:38:11,723 --> 00:38:13,236
- Move it, Merlie.

576
00:38:13,236 --> 00:38:14,068
All right.

577
00:38:14,068 --> 00:38:14,901
On my way over here,

578
00:38:14,901 --> 00:38:17,258
we's havin' and go by a house,

579
00:38:17,258 --> 00:38:19,818
woman naked standin'
right in the front window!

580
00:38:19,818 --> 00:38:21,128
- Well, who was she?

581
00:38:21,128 --> 00:38:23,711
- Your wife! (laughs)

582
00:38:23,711 --> 00:38:25,388
- These is my neighbors.

583
00:38:25,388 --> 00:38:27,858
I ain't never seen 'em
like this before.

584
00:38:27,858 --> 00:38:31,570
Never before my whole
life, and that is a fact.

585
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:32,570
- Like what?

586
00:38:33,941 --> 00:38:35,618
- Hey, I ain't one for words
Miss Amelia,

587
00:38:35,618 --> 00:38:40,278
but I know everythin' useful
in life's got a price,

588
00:38:40,278 --> 00:38:41,708
and can only be bought with money.

589
00:38:41,708 --> 00:38:43,358
And that is the way the world is run.

590
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:45,818
Ain't that right, Miss Amelia?

591
00:38:45,818 --> 00:38:48,348
- Maybe, maybe so. So what?

592
00:38:48,348 --> 00:38:49,336
- [Customer] Thank you, Miss Amelia.

593
00:38:49,336 --> 00:38:51,986
- Well, you know, not
havin' to think about it,

594
00:38:51,986 --> 00:38:53,583
the price of bale of cotton

595
00:38:53,583 --> 00:38:55,903
or a quart of molasses.

596
00:38:55,903 --> 00:38:57,978
(people laughing)
(people chattering)

597
00:38:57,978 --> 00:39:00,431
Human life, it ain't
got no value put on it.

598
00:39:01,638 --> 00:39:05,501
Seems like you work and you
slave and you try all your life.

599
00:39:09,328 --> 00:39:12,513
All you're tryin' to do
is just to fend off death.

600
00:39:12,513 --> 00:39:15,066
(Lymon laughing wildly)

601
00:39:15,066 --> 00:39:18,150
(people chattering)

602
00:39:19,308 --> 00:39:21,508
Look at these people,
and maybe they forget.

603
00:39:23,078 --> 00:39:23,911
- Two liquors.

604
00:39:25,418 --> 00:39:28,058
- Maybe they forgettin' they
ain't worth much in this world.

605
00:39:28,058 --> 00:39:30,148
It's just like me, Miss
Amelia, I ain't worth much.

606
00:39:30,148 --> 00:39:31,428
I never was worth much.

607
00:39:31,428 --> 00:39:33,268
I never could be worth much, but.

608
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:37,495
Right now I feel good.

609
00:39:37,495 --> 00:39:41,235
(people chattering)
(people laughing)

610
00:39:41,235 --> 00:39:44,318

00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:54,961
(water bubbling)
(crickets chirping)

612
00:39:54,961 --> 00:39:59,675
- Whoo, this is fun!

613
00:39:59,675 --> 00:40:02,341
(both laughing)

614
00:40:04,063 --> 00:40:06,143
When we gonna get there?

615
00:40:06,143 --> 00:40:09,043
- It's far as there around the bend.

616
00:40:09,043 --> 00:40:10,460
- I'm so thirsty.

617
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,773
- A lot of liquor up by the still.

618
00:40:13,773 --> 00:40:17,738
- Ho-hoh.
- You just love that liquor.

619
00:40:17,738 --> 00:40:20,328
- I can't wait.
- Gonna have to.

620
00:40:20,328 --> 00:40:22,938
- Ah, you are always so slow, Amelia.

621
00:40:22,938 --> 00:40:26,216
(thunder crashes)

622
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:29,333

625
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:42,071
(Lymon laughing)

626
00:40:42,071 --> 00:40:44,821
(rain splashing)

627
00:40:48,976 --> 00:40:50,656
(tree crashes)

628
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:51,488
Amelia!

629
00:40:53,926 --> 00:40:56,593
(Amelia laughs)

630
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:05,173
(Lymon laughing)

631
00:41:05,173 --> 00:41:07,303

(rain pouring)

633
00:41:22,618 --> 00:41:25,223
(clock chiming)

634
00:41:25,223 --> 00:41:28,301
- (sighs) Did I ever
show you Papa's acorn?

635
00:41:30,408 --> 00:41:31,241
- Nope.

636
00:41:32,178 --> 00:41:35,506
(clock ticking)

637
00:41:35,506 --> 00:41:38,256
(rain splashing)

638
00:41:53,035 --> 00:41:55,868
(thunder rolling)

639
00:41:57,133 --> 00:41:59,801
(clock ticking)

640
00:42:06,048 --> 00:42:07,448
What does the acorn signify?

641
00:42:08,338 --> 00:42:09,771
- Oh, it's just an acorn.

642
00:42:11,081 --> 00:42:12,848
(laughs) It's just an acorn
I picked up

643
00:42:12,848 --> 00:42:15,308
in the afternoon
Big Papa died. (laughs)

644
00:42:15,308 --> 00:42:16,201
- How do you mean?

645
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:19,618
- I mean, it's just an acorn I
spied on the ground that day.

646
00:42:19,618 --> 00:42:23,163
I pick it up and put in
my pocket. I dunno why.

647
00:42:23,163 --> 00:42:24,578
- Hmm, what else you got in here?

648
00:42:24,578 --> 00:42:27,288
(treasures rattling)

649
00:42:27,288 --> 00:42:29,026
What are these stones, Amelia?

650
00:42:29,026 --> 00:42:32,156
- Oh, they, they're not important.

651
00:42:32,156 --> 00:42:33,778
- Then why do you keep 'em?

652
00:42:33,778 --> 00:42:37,761
- Well, they're my kidney stones.

653
00:42:38,906 --> 00:42:40,378
I had this pain years back.

654
00:42:40,378 --> 00:42:42,211
The doctor in Chehaw cut 'em out.

655
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:46,408
I never felt such a pain
in all my life.

656
00:42:46,408 --> 00:42:47,988
That's why I keep 'em.

657
00:42:49,198 --> 00:42:51,276
To remember the pain.

658
00:42:51,276 --> 00:42:56,276
(clock ticking)
(rain splashing)

659
00:42:58,825 --> 00:43:01,491

660
00:43:05,966 --> 00:43:07,568
(cane banging)

661
00:43:07,568 --> 00:43:10,028
- Where'd ya get that cane, Amelia?

662
00:43:10,028 --> 00:43:12,001
Good sugar cane's green in color.

663
00:43:12,948 --> 00:43:14,961
Any fool knows that.

664
00:43:14,961 --> 00:43:17,628
(cane thudding)

665
00:43:19,303 --> 00:43:21,583
S'mornin' I went up to
Rotten Lake to fish.

666
00:43:21,583 --> 00:43:22,598
- Yeah.

667
00:43:22,598 --> 00:43:24,261
- Steppin' over this fallen tree.

668
00:43:25,308 --> 00:43:28,988
Straddled right over it, and
it suddenly started to stir.

669
00:43:28,988 --> 00:43:31,795
I looked down, (laughs) I'll
be damn if it wasn't a gator,

670
00:43:31,795 --> 00:43:34,828
as long as from here over
there to that there door.

671
00:43:34,828 --> 00:43:36,213
And as thick as a hog.

672
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:37,378
(hog grunts)

673
00:43:37,378 --> 00:43:39,701
- Miss Amelia said you
been in bed all day.

674
00:43:40,588 --> 00:43:42,596
Sick with the stomach quinsy.

675
00:43:42,596 --> 00:43:44,801
(fly buzzing)
- I snuck out.

676
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:48,343
Amelia don't know half of what I do.

677
00:43:48,343 --> 00:43:50,895
- [Man] Who's gonna work

678
00:43:50,895 --> 00:43:52,316
(men yelling)

679
00:43:52,316 --> 00:43:54,996

00:43:54,996 --> 00:43:58,106
take our wives, our
daughters and our sisters?

681
00:43:58,106 --> 00:43:59,806
- [All] Hell no!

682
00:43:59,806 --> 00:44:01,738
- [Man] Brothers, I'm
tellin' ya that today

683
00:44:01,738 --> 00:44:03,935
if we allow a nigger to address

684
00:44:03,935 --> 00:44:06,996
a white woman on the
streets, he will rape and-

685
00:44:06,996 --> 00:44:09,626
- If you don't wanna end

686
00:44:09,626 --> 00:44:10,498

687

(men yelling)

690
00:44:15,441 --> 00:44:18,526
- [Man] Our women and
our sacred white race.

691
00:44:18,526 --> 00:44:19,838
What is the way?

692
00:44:19,838 --> 00:44:21,828

693
00:44:21,828 --> 00:44:23,665

695
00:44:44,495 --> 00:44:47,213
(chair scrapes)

696
00:44:47,213 --> 00:44:49,796
(chair creaks)

697
00:44:54,768 --> 00:44:56,986
- I got a letter from my brother?

698
00:44:56,986 --> 00:44:59,986
(easy piano music)

699
00:45:02,488 --> 00:45:05,248

- He's on parole.

701
00:45:08,068 --> 00:45:09,843
He's out of the penitentiary.

702
00:45:09,843 --> 00:45:11,153
- Who?

703
00:45:11,153 --> 00:45:12,428

00:45:19,288 --> 00:45:20,906
He belongs to be in that penitentiary

707
00:45:20,906 --> 00:45:23,198
for the rest of his life! (slams palm)

708
00:45:23,198 --> 00:45:26,458
- What's he done?
(Amelia bangs table)

709
00:45:26,458 --> 00:45:27,908
Well, what's he done?

710
00:45:27,908 --> 00:45:30,158
Well he's on parole

He musta done somethin'
What's he done?

You all know! Somebody

00:45:35,758 --> 00:45:38,328
- He robbed a couple of
fillin' stations.

714
00:45:38,328 --> 00:45:40,558
- Is that all? What else has he done?

715
00:45:40,558 --> 00:45:42,838
- Why, he's lower than a
snake belly in a wagon rut!

716
00:45:42,838 --> 00:45:45,908
He will not set his split
hoof on my premises.

717
00:45:45,908 --> 00:45:48,538
- Who is Amelia? Who is he?

718
00:45:48,538 --> 00:45:49,431
What's he done?

719
00:45:51,378 --> 00:45:53,528
Why are you so riled, Amelia?

(haunting music)

903
00:59:52,356 --> 00:59:55,106
(engine roaring)

904
00:59:58,321 --> 01:00:01,738
(engine sputtering)

905
01:00:01,738 --> 01:00:04,488
(haunting music)

906
01:00:19,288 --> 01:00:22,871
(haunting music continues)

907
01:00:42,535 --> 01:00:46,118
(haunting music continues)

908
01:01:22,245 --> 01:01:25,078
(cicadas droning)

909
01:01:33,858 --> 01:01:36,311
(children chattering)

910
01:01:36,311 --> 01:01:39,393
(slow sliding music)

911
01:01:58,708 --> 01:01:59,828
- Who is that runt?

912
01:02:01,758 --> 01:02:02,878
- Lymon Willis.

913
01:02:02,878 --> 01:02:04,271
He cousin to Miss Amelia.

914
01:02:06,731 --> 01:02:07,691
She cares for him.

915
01:02:14,528 --> 01:02:18,801
- She cares for that brokeback.

916
01:02:22,348 --> 01:02:23,948
- Why did you come back, Marvin?

917
01:02:27,815 --> 01:02:29,315
- This is my home.

918
01:02:32,418 --> 01:02:34,718
(crow cawing)

919
01:02:34,718 --> 01:02:36,281
- Marvin changed himself,

920
01:02:37,178 --> 01:02:38,891
that time he loved Miss Amelia.

921
01:02:40,438 --> 01:02:41,948
Well, it seemed like
he changed completely.

922
01:02:41,948 --> 01:02:46,318
He was, he was good to me
and to Henry.

923
01:02:46,318 --> 01:02:47,718
You remember that, don't ya?

924
01:02:50,238 --> 01:02:51,898
- I remember that, yeah.

925
01:02:53,981 --> 01:02:55,281
- Why'd she throw him out?

926
01:02:56,333 --> 01:02:59,188
Why'd she marry him
and then throw him out?

927
01:02:59,188 --> 01:03:00,021
Why?

928
01:03:01,828 --> 01:03:06,828
- I don't know.

929
01:03:09,503 --> 01:03:10,671
All I know is,

930
01:03:13,736 --> 01:03:16,241
and it takes two people to be in love.

931
01:03:17,228 --> 01:03:18,158
It takes the

932
01:03:19,458 --> 01:03:22,991
lover and the beloved.

933
01:03:24,018 --> 01:03:27,811
But these two, they come
from uh, different countries.

934
01:03:28,808 --> 01:03:30,126
And sometimes the,

935
01:03:31,758 --> 01:03:35,208
the beloved is the cause for all the,

936
01:03:35,208 --> 01:03:37,338
all the stored-up love

937
01:03:37,338 --> 01:03:39,718
that's layin' in the
heart of the lover

938
01:03:39,718 --> 01:03:42,778
for such a long time.

939
01:03:42,778 --> 01:03:46,278
And every lover knows that

940
01:03:47,638 --> 01:03:50,498
deep, deep in his soul.

941
01:03:50,498 --> 01:03:55,498
He knows that his love is a
lonely and solitary thing.

942
01:03:56,111 --> 01:03:58,988
(laughs) And the funny thing is,

943
01:03:58,988 --> 01:04:00,838
the object of that love

944
01:04:02,908 --> 01:04:07,908
can be anybody, and it
just don't matter one whit.

945
01:04:11,378 --> 01:04:13,818
That's why, I guess most
of us, we'd rather be

946
01:04:14,828 --> 01:04:16,148
the lover than the beloved.

947
01:04:16,148 --> 01:04:18,351
I mean, because the state of bein'

948
01:04:19,628 --> 01:04:23,851
beloved is intolerable.

949
01:04:25,468 --> 01:04:26,768
See, and then after awhile

950
01:04:28,108 --> 01:04:30,768
the beloved gets to hate the lover,

951
01:04:30,768 --> 01:04:32,918
because the lover's
always tryin' to strip,

952
01:04:32,918 --> 01:04:35,881
strip, strip bare the beloved.

953
01:04:37,688 --> 01:04:41,051
See that's because the, the lover,

954
01:04:42,053 --> 01:04:44,438
(gentle music)

955
01:04:44,438 --> 01:04:45,721
he craves that love,

956
01:04:47,718 --> 01:04:50,208
even though he knows that that love

957
01:04:50,208 --> 01:04:52,201
can only 'cause him pain.

958
01:04:54,228 --> 01:04:56,946
(gentle music)

959
01:04:56,946 --> 01:04:59,696
(dirt crunching)

960
01:05:10,538 --> 01:05:15,188
- Did you have a good time
in the penitentiary? (laughs)

961
01:05:16,166 --> 01:05:18,666
(knife snaps)

962
01:05:31,086 --> 01:05:33,670
(horn honking)

963
01:05:41,816 --> 01:05:44,840
(car door slams)

964
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:47,590
(haunting music)

965
01:05:48,693 --> 01:05:50,943
- What ails this brokeback?

966
01:05:54,098 --> 01:05:55,761
What, is the runt throwin' a fit?

967
01:06:05,523 --> 01:06:08,838
(hand slaps)
(Lymon groans)

968
01:06:08,838 --> 01:06:10,458
That'll learn ya, brokeback.

969
01:06:14,983 --> 01:06:17,816
(dramatic music)

970
01:06:35,613 --> 01:06:40,163
- Oh. (groaning)

971
01:06:43,308 --> 01:06:46,141
- Why?
(Lymon crying)

972
01:06:47,808 --> 01:06:49,821
Why, Cousin Lymon? Why?

973
01:06:56,448 --> 01:06:57,841
- Oh, Marvin Macy,

974
01:06:59,061 --> 01:07:00,611
he's been to Atlanta.

975
01:07:03,681 --> 01:07:05,706
- Goin' to Atlanta does him no credit.

976
01:07:07,890 --> 01:07:09,838
- Oh, he's been on a chain gang.

977
01:07:11,848 --> 01:07:13,681
He's been to the penitentiary.

978
01:07:18,138 --> 01:07:19,841
- Been to penitentiary?

979
01:07:21,568 --> 01:07:24,411
Why, that trip ain't no
travel to brag about.

980
01:07:27,618 --> 01:07:28,671
- Marvin Macy.

981
01:07:30,728 --> 01:07:34,303
- Blessed are the meek for
they shall inherit the earth.

982
01:07:34,303 --> 01:07:35,263
Blessed are the children.

983
01:07:35,263 --> 01:07:38,431
(door bangs)
In Jesus-

984
01:07:45,441 --> 01:07:48,525
(crickets chirping)

985
01:07:53,296 --> 01:07:56,046
(apple crunches)

986

(people gasp)

990
01:08:55,660 --> 01:08:58,160
(chair thuds)

991
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:04,168
- Can I fix you somethin',
Marvin Macy?

992
01:09:04,168 --> 01:09:05,468
You want somethin' to eat?

993
01:09:06,338 --> 01:09:08,846
- Get outta my way, runt.
(Lymon yells)

994
01:09:08,846 --> 01:09:13,846
(people chattering)
(Lymon gasps)

995
01:09:17,133 --> 01:09:19,800
(clock ticking)

996
01:09:34,908 --> 01:09:35,981
- Maybe Marvin Macy would like

997
01:09:35,981 --> 01:09:38,248
some of your fine liquor, Amelia.

998
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:46,520
(crickets chirping)
(clock ticking)

999
01:09:57,536 --> 01:10:00,976

1004
01:10:33,190 --> 01:10:36,548
(haunting music)

1005
01:10:36,548 --> 01:10:40,831
- Nice place you got here,
Miss Amelia.

1006
01:10:43,706 --> 01:10:45,435
(birds chirping)

1007
01:10:45,435 --> 01:10:48,185
(Lymon coughing)

1008
01:10:52,583 --> 01:10:55,251
(Lymon panting)

1009
01:11:04,655 --> 01:11:07,808
- How come you never sweat,
Marvin Macy?

1010
01:11:07,808 --> 01:11:08,711
How come that is?

1011
01:11:15,776 --> 01:11:18,896
You wanna see somethin'?

1012
01:11:18,896 --> 01:11:21,185
You know what these are?

1013
01:11:21,185 --> 01:11:23,085
These are Miss Amelia's kidney stones.

1014
01:11:24,368 --> 01:11:25,988
You ever heard such a thing?

1015
01:11:25,988 --> 01:11:29,296
Miss Amelia's kidney stones. (laughs)

1016
01:11:29,296 --> 01:11:32,046
(birds chirping)

1017
01:11:35,936 --> 01:11:40,248
(watch cover clicks)
(watch ticking)

1018
01:11:40,248 --> 01:11:41,811
- This is my watch, runt!

1019
01:11:43,738 --> 01:11:44,941
She stole it from me.

1020
01:11:46,258 --> 01:11:47,708
How come you got it? Huh?

1021
01:11:48,968 --> 01:11:50,858
- Miss Amelia gave it to me.

1022
01:11:50,858 --> 01:11:52,678
Honest Marvin, it was a present.

1023
01:11:52,678 --> 01:11:54,948
You can have it, you can keep it.

1024
01:12:06,413 --> 01:12:09,331
(watch lid clicks)

1025
01:12:18,395 --> 01:12:20,895
You wanna know somethin' else?

1026
01:12:22,541 --> 01:12:24,301
You wanna see Miss Amelia's still?

1027
01:12:25,678 --> 01:12:26,511
- Maybe.

1028
01:12:30,178 --> 01:12:31,011
Where is it?

1029
01:12:33,158 --> 01:12:34,338
- Just up a piece.

1030
01:12:36,108 --> 01:12:37,908
I'll take you there if you wanna go.

1031
01:12:53,558 --> 01:12:55,351
- So you mean to travel,

1032
01:12:56,828 --> 01:13:00,891
loom-fixer? (laughs)

1033
01:13:00,891 --> 01:13:03,878

(Amelia whistling)

1037
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:19,788
- Marvin Macy's gonna be
visitin' a spell with us.

1038
01:13:19,788 --> 01:13:21,838
(feet thudding)

1039

(Marvin laughing)
(Lymon chattering)

1041
01:13:36,950 --> 01:13:37,998
You know, when you shot those guys.

1042
01:13:37,998 --> 01:13:40,676
You shot their eyes-
(Marvin laughing)

1043
01:13:40,676 --> 01:13:42,958
(Lymon laughing)

1044
01:13:42,958 --> 01:13:46,358

- Everythin' you holler at
me bounces back on yourself.

1068
01:17:02,808 --> 01:17:04,801
- Is that so?

1069
01:17:06,148 --> 01:17:11,148
- Yeah. That's so, Miss Amelia.

1070
01:17:27,556 --> 01:17:30,390
(Amelia grunting)

1071
01:17:34,238 --> 01:17:35,701
Go get me somethin' to eat.

I'm hungry.
(clock ticking)

1074

Oh, you really are somethin',
Marvin Macy.

1075

- I ain't so hungry after all.

1080
01:18:59,238 --> 01:19:00,071
- What you mean?

1081
01:19:01,098 --> 01:19:03,641
