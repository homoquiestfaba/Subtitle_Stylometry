So, Richard,
are you allowed to tell us

28
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:55,369
what's going to be
in tomorrow's column?

29
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:56,432
Haven't written it yet.

30
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,441
You haven't written it yet?

31
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,943
Would you believe that
nothing of interest has happened

32
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,377
in the last 24 hours?

33
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:01,778
If there aren't
any scandals

34
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:03,645
by midnight, I'm going to have
to make something up.

35
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:04,774
You know how I hate
to do that.

36
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:07,411
I have missed you.

37
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:08,420
I haven't seen you

38
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:09,716
all summer,
and, oh, my god,

39
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,348
you've both got
more gorgeous.

40
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:12,356
I hate you.

41
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:13,414
Hi, Richard.

42
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:15,324
Look what we brought.
Chocolates!

43
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,385
Mm-mm-mm.

44
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:17,487
How is he?

45
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,497
My father?

46
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,533
He's fine, Stephen.

47
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:21,591
He's fine.

48
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:23,568
What, do you think he's going
to evaporate if you go

49
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:24,864
one day
without seeing him?

50
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:25,905
Bruno here yet?

51
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,133
And ruin his entrance?

52
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:29,368
You know he never gets here
before you two.

53
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:33,207
Fasten your seatbelts.

54
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,043
It's going to be
a bumpy night.

55
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:37,276
This season, I am paying
for my ticket, Stephen.

56
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,578
I mean it.

57
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:40,312
For Christ's sake, Cheryl,
let them pay for it.

58
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:41,684
With what my father
pays them,

59
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:43,187
believe me,
they can afford it.

60
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:44,723
And we're worth
every penny.

61
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:45,723
Says who?

62
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:46,884
Oh, I don't know; your father.

63
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,791
Your mother,
your brothers.

64
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,125
Shall we?

65
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:56,192
I can't wait to see
the look on Stephen's face.

66
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:57,201
What?

67
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,202
What's the matter?

68
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,535
I'm just not sure
about this.

69
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,235
Jack, this is
your birthday present.

70
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:05,642
This is what you said
you wanted.

71
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:07,805
Visiting him
is what I wanted.

72
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,812
Making it a surprise

73
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:10,473
was your idea.

74
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:11,881
You remember when he was little.

75
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,478
He loved surprises.

76
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,988
Ada, he's not
a kid anymore.

77
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,383
He's all grown up.

78
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:42,748
So you didn't think the soprano
sounded a little flat.

79
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:43,804
She sounded fine to me.

80
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,317
I think
she sounded flat.

81
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:46,511
She was fine.

82
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:47,849
But Ricci was magnificent.

83
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,353
Incredible.

84
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:50,480
Excuse us.

85
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:53,014
Nobody sees Mr. Ricci
during intermission.

86
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,862
Max, I told you I didn't want
to see anybody.

87
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:03,026
Bravo, Maestro.

88
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,036
You were
terrific.

89
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,765
Oh, boys.

90
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:06,770
Where's Max?

91
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,136
Max?

92
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:09,937
My bodyguard.

93
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,637
He's not out here.

94
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:12,645
You got a bodyguard?

95
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,842
Make enemies
with the wrong people...

96
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:18,901
How's your pop,
Danny?

97
00:05:18,936 --> 00:05:20,818
He's good,
real good.

98
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:22,582
He listens to your records
all the time.

99
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,418
Pardon my eating
like this, boys.

100
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,118
15 minutes, Mr. Ricci!

101
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,787
Boys, excuse me.

102
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:29,850
My love to your parents.

103
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,693
I mean that.

104
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:40,132
Boys, I said
please excuse me.

105
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,734
You gamble
too much, Maestro.

106
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:47,212
Even money you don't have,
you lose,

107
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,113
borrow to pay it back.

108
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,480
And the worst part is,

109
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,850
you end up owing
your friends money.

110
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:58,083
What the hell
is it to you?

111
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:02,220
You were supposed to pay
Victor Patrizzi $40,000

112
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:03,785
in August.

113
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,230
It's now September.

114
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,426
To treat a man
like Don Patrizzi in this way,

115
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:12,665
well, it shows
a lack of respect.

116
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,866
Respect.

117
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:17,933
I should give
an asshole like that respect?

118
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,740
Do you have any money with you?

119
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,409
You usually carry a blank check.

120
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,584
This is what
Patrizzi sends me,

121
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,286
a couple of fairies

122
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,090
in diapers?

123
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:39,326
Now, you listen
to me, girls.

124
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:43,267
You tell Victor Patrizzi
he'll get his money

125
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:46,204
when I'm good and ready!

126
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,242
Now get out
before Max throws you out.

127
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,110
Relax, Maestro.

128
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:57,480
Breathe through your nose.

129
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,450
The blank check,
where is it?

130
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:00,747
Through your nose,
Maestro.

131
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:01,754
There you go.

132
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:02,948
Breathe through your nose.

133
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:04,889
That's it.

134
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:06,015
Don't swallow.

135
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:07,582
There you go.

136
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,957
You're going to have

137
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,622
to help us out here,
Maestro.

138
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:14,066
You need to write out
a check made to "cash"

139
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,795
for $40,000.

140
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:31,541
Do you have enough money
in your account to cover this?

141
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:32,608
No.

142
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:34,209
That's fine.

143
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,050
Today's Saturday.

144
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:39,148
You have
till Wednesday.

145
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,625
You okay,
Maestro?

146
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:49,190
Here;
drink some water.

147
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,896
There you go.

148
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:55,101
Sing a good second half,
all right?

149
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,768
We're all counting
on you.

150
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,606
You sound great
out there.

151
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:04,445
Well, that was
a disappointing second act.

152
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,212
What was wrong
with him?

153
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,083
Perhaps
he did it on purpose.

154
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,418
Maybe it was his interpretation
of the role.

155
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:11,889
Interpretation?

156
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:13,755
He looked like he didn't know
where he was.

157
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,225
And his voice,
oh!

158
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:19,061
That was a terrible thing
to say, you know.

159
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:20,689
What?

160
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:23,133
About Stephen being
all grown up.

161
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,535
You said it to hurt me,
didn't you?

162
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:28,369
Or did you forget I just
happen to be his mother?

163
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,272
Who are you calling?

164
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,401
Stephen.

165
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:32,968
We're going to see him
in two days.

166
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:34,991
And I haven't spoken to him
in almost a week.

167
00:08:35,026 --> 00:08:36,938
You'll pardon me, Jack,
if I want to make sure

168
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,780
everything's all right
with my only son.

169
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,615
Ada, what are you afraid
will happen?

170
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:43,178
He lives in New York City!

171
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,621
What am I afraid will happen?

172
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:47,217
Your life isn't worth
a stick of gum in that city.

173
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,594
I got it!

174
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,426
Hello?

175
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:54,092
Hi.

176
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,100
Good. And you?

177
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,171
Sure, sure, just a second.

178
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,195
Honey!

179
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,969
Honey, it's your mother.

180
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:03,998
I'm in the shower.

181
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,244
Oh, he's in the shower.

182
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,409
No, no, no, nothing's wrong.

183
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:15,317
The hospital?

184
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,720
Where do you get these ideas,
Mrs. Torcelli?

185
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,226
Yes, I read the papers.

186
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:25,458
No, that only happens to people
who go jogging alone at night.

187
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,625
Stephen never goes

188
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,634
jogging alone at night.

189
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:32,603
Murder capital of the world?

190
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:33,605
No.

191
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,630
New York is much safer now.

192
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:38,976
Yes,

193
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:41,002
I've heard of them.

194
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,015
Mrs. Torcelli,
I wouldn't know where

195
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,108
to find a crack house
if I wanted to.

196
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:48,518
Yeah, business is going
real well.

197
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,287
Yeah, really well.

198
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,026
Yeah.

199
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,823
We've been making a killing.

200
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,824
Mrs. Torcelli,

201
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:01,128
yeah, I got another call
coming through.

202
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:01,826
It's a customer.

203
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:04,093
Yeah, day and night.

204
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:07,299
You know, catering business,
cutthroat.

205
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,306
All right.

206
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,332
Good-bye, Mrs. Torcelli.

207
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,451
I feel like an idiot
every time I talk to her.

208
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:27,925
What's so idiotic
about the idea

209
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,462
of us running
a catering company?

210
00:10:29,497 --> 00:10:30,451
Stephen, we can't cook.

211
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,123
Are we ever going
to tell your parents

212
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:33,222
what we do
for a living?

213
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:35,096
Danny, I don't think
they could handle it.

214
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:36,327
Oh, they couldn't handle it

215
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:37,996
or you couldn't handle
them knowing?

216
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,594
Hey, fellas.

217
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:44,367
Busy night.

218
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,638
Whoa!

219
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,841
Been a lot of that?

220
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:52,750
Is he in back?

221
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,133
He's waiting for you.

222
00:10:54,168 --> 00:10:55,481
I'll see youse later.

223
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,421
Hey, Stephen.
Hey, Danny.

224
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,984
Good costume.

225
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,128
Looking good.

226
00:11:05,163 --> 00:11:07,227
Hey.

227
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:09,062
How you doing, guys?

228
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:22,171
Vito.

229
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:23,704
Vito, wake up.

230
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,376
You're here alone
with your father.

231
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,352
You're supposed
to be bodyguarding.

232
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,512
I am bodyguarding.

233
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:29,987
Do you realize
what an honor it is

234
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,717
to be trusted
with your father's life?

235
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:33,156
Does he know you're asleep?

236
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:34,453
I wasn't asleep.

237
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,518
I can't believe
you guys thought I was asleep.

238
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,254
Where's your brother?

239
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:40,423
He's out front.

240
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:42,627
He's in the back
sewing costumes again, isn't he?

241
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,135
Frankie
sewing costumes?

242
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,569
Did he make
Tania's new outfit?

243
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:46,570
I don't know what-

244
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,664
Frankie.

245
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:51,600
You know what it does
to your father

246
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,544
when he sees you sewing;
watch your head.

247
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,877
You're supposed
to be managing the club.

248
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:57,108
I am.

249
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,411
I am managing the club.

250
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:01,181
Yeah? What about the drunk guy
with the tattoos?

251
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:02,948
Tattoos?

252
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:05,786
Yeah, Leo and Eddie had
to take him out.

253
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,227
What would your kids say
if they saw you now?

254
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:13,787
They'd be proud.

255
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:21,530
You know what this means.

256
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,804
Uh-huh.

257
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:26,436
We said if we ever
got engaged-

258
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,912
No, no.

259
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,350
Damon, we talked
about this.

260
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:33,373
Talked about what?

261
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,410
Damon.

262
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:36,819
It's time
to tell our parents.

263
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:53,937
So...

264
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:54,973
how did it go?

265
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:04,915
Oh, my boys,
my boys.

266
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,442
Did you pass Vito
on the way in?

267
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,388
Why aren't the two of you
Sicilian?

268
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:15,950
Then you could take over
the family

269
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:17,290
after I die.

270
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,627
We don't want to take over
the family, Padrone.

271
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:21,895
He's a good son.
You have two good sons.

272
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,526
They love you.

273
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:26,202
4:00 in the morning.

274
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:27,204
Honey-

275
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:28,570
We have to get all the way

276
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,006
to Indianapolis by tomorrow.

277
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,544
It's our first trip
to see Stephen and Danny.

278
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:35,376
I want everything
to be perfect.

279
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:36,539
Right.

280
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:44,688
All over,

281
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,884
we're being chased out.

282
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,656
First the fish market,
then the garbage trucks.

283
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:52,926
How are we going
to make a living?

284
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:55,058
It's almost like
we're being forced into drugs.

285
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,227
Please, drugs.

286
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,361
You know

287
00:13:58,404 --> 00:13:59,564
how I feel about drugs.

288
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,038
It's easy for you, Victor.

289
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:02,199
It's never easy.

290
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,003
Do I look like a mushroom,
Victor?

291
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,237
Stop feeding me bullshit;
You should pardon the expression.

292
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,439
You're exaggerating
the difference between us.

293
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,038
As I said before, bullshit.

294
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:12,141
You should again pardon
the expression.

295
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,585
I always say,
"Stick with what you know.

296
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,020
"Stick with what works.

297
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:18,454
Stick with what's clean. "

298
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,924
The numbers,
there's a clean business.

299
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:23,484
Unions,
there's a clean business.

300
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,895
Prostitution,
there's a clean business.

301
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:29,327
Oh, Damon, my boy.

302
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,138
I can't believe it.

303
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,264
Engaged.

304
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:37,298
What did you say
her name was?

305
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:39,038
I didn't.

306
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:40,271
It's Jenny.

307
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:41,939
Jenny Patrizzi.

308
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,675
Is she pretty?
Matt.

309
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,705
She's beautiful.

310
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,411
What did you say
her family does?

311
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,418
Dear?
What does her father do?

312
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,424
For a living.

313
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,358
Yoo-hoo!

314
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:56,553
I don't know?

315
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,098
Now, about
the blue fish-

316
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:04,125
Blue fish.
And to drink?

317
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:05,602
How do they grill that?

318
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:07,265
It's in a mustard remoulade.

319
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,136
Doesn't it turn flaky?

320
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:14,613
Well, how would you describe
the consistency?

321
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,774
It's somewhere
between sole and tuna.

322
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,544
Oh.

323
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,051
That comes
with avocado polenta.

324
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,052
How does that-
Vito.

325
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,577
I think
Mr. Levine is hungry.

326
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:24,748
Okay.

327
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,816
I'll have...

328
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,691
He'll have whatever
he was talking about.

329
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,888
The blue fish.

330
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:31,987
He'll have the blue fish.

331
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:33,497
Okay.

332
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:41,598
Victor,

333
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,801
the things you're up on.

334
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:46,970
Wireless this,
internet that.

335
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:47,979
You're as old as I am.

336
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,002
Who taught you all that?

337
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:51,481
It's the 21 st century, Marvin.

338
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:52,848
Got to look forward,
not back.

339
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,284
You know
what you are, Victor?

340
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,309
You're a genius.

341
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:56,411
You're a goddamn genius.

342
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:57,420
Would you excuse me?

343
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:58,421
I have to-

344
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,651
Vito, Mr. Levine
is talking.

345
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,058
Well, he's just embarrassed

346
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:03,618
to hear me talk
about you like that.

347
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,597
You have to go
to the bathroom?

348
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:06,655
Yes.

349
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,826
All right, go, go.

350
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,869
What, are you crazy,
Victor?

351
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:14,907
Leaving you alone?

352
00:16:14,942 --> 00:16:16,135
He had to go.

353
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,402
Well, since when

354
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:19,240
do you sit in public
without a bodyguard?

355
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,541
You don't see me letting my son
go take a piss, do you?

356
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:23,308
I'd make him pee
in his pants right here.

357
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:24,577
Tell him; tell him.

358
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:25,605
Bodyguard?

359
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,141
He's not my bodyguard.

360
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:30,518
Those are my bodyguards.

361
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,650
Those guys?

362
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:38,060
Victor.
They're figureless.

363
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:40,926
Animals.

364
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:46,661
Those guys?

365
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,402
You know what?

366
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,443
They're tougher
than they look.

367
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:53,468
Tougher than they look?

368
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:55,836
Imagine.

369
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:07,317
Vito, you're supposed
to be in the bathroom.

370
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,487
You left your father's table
for this.

371
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:15,626
What would he say
if he saw you?

372
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,362
Let's go.

373
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:24,499
Do you even have to go
to the bathroom?

374
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:25,702
Please tell me you did.

375
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:29,077
Tell me you didn't lie
to your father on purpose.

376
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:33,876
You're going
to be Padrone one day.

377
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,149
What's the matter
with you?

378
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:45,261
So how did you guys meet?

379
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:47,390
We were Army Rangers
together.

380
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,401
This was before
"don't ask, don't tell. "

381
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,266
We asked.

382
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:53,168
We told.

383
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,836
So what does this
make Patrizzi?

384
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,174
A fairy godfather?

385
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:06,815
You have an upset stomach
or something?

386
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:08,581
No.

387
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,347
Old man, get in the car!

388
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,914
Get the car-now!
Must be Levine.

389
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,221
You go.
What about you?

390
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,125
I'll stay with him;
you go.

391
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:19,357
Hurry up,; hurry up!

392
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,455
You okay?

393
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,561
Your job is, before they
drive off with your father,

394
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:56,898
you make them
kill you first.

395
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,901
Okay?

396
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:02,404
You know we'd love to come
and visit you in New York, son,

397
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,965
but I don't know
if I'll have the time.

398
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,602
Of course he'll have
the time, dear.

399
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:07,872
You'll make the time.

400
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,006
I just don't want to get
his hopes up for nothing.

401
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,014
Nonsense.

402
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,482
Of course we'll go.

403
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,783
Of course we'll go.

404
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,981
Damon, darling,

405
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:18,922
could we please talk more
about this later?

406
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:19,923
Sure, Mom.

407
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,620
Mom, Dad, I love you.

408
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:24,127
Oh, we love you too, son.

409
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:26,630
Yeah.

410
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:28,757
Oh, boy.

411
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:32,900
Alma, we can't go
to New York.

412
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:35,805
New York's a stronghold
of the occupation army.

413
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,706
That phone call
was a sign.

414
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:39,404
But Damon isn't even
in the movement.

415
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:40,604
A sign from the Lord.

416
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:43,342
Oh, god, Matt,
I think it may finally be time.

417
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:46,350
Alma, in our lifetime?

418
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:48,909
The days of the so-called
federaI so-called government

419
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,182
are coming to an end.

420
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:52,486
Matt, it's time to attack.

421
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,821
But, Alma, New York.

422
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,850
I mean, I always thought
the final struggle

423
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,225
would begin
in their capital.

424
00:19:57,262 --> 00:20:00,129
No, in Washington,
the enemy is strong.

425
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:02,633
In New York, they're weak.

426
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,067
Come.

427
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:06,036
The others are probably here.

428
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,203
I'm fine.

429
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:13,871
I can see you're fine, Papa.

430
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:16,506
I'm not worried
about what happened today.

431
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:17,913
I'm worried about what could-

432
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,577
They weren't
after me.

433
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:20,811
I feel better when Stephen and Danny
are with you.

434
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,251
Why can't they be
with you all the time?

435
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:24,118
Because they're busy.

436
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,384
They run my whole operation.

437
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:26,651
Someone else can.

438
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,717
Who? Who someone?

439
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,022
Vito and Frankie?

440
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,359
Vito and Frankie.

441
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:33,356
Let's go play upstairs

442
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,389
in the family room.

443
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,869
Why?

444
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,335
Why are you always talking bad

445
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,035
about your sons, Victor?

446
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,067
And with their children sitting
right here.

447
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,272
A soldier must inspire fear,
Stella.

448
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:50,907
Vito and Frankie
do not inspire fear.

449
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:52,610
Of course they inspire fear.

450
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:53,708
I'm afraid of them.

451
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:55,412
Everybody's afraid of them.

452
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:57,389
Stephen, Danny, tell him
how afraid you are

453
00:20:57,424 --> 00:20:58,583
of Vito and Frankie.

454
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,717
The dancing girls at the club

455
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,885
are not afraid
of Vito and Frankie.

456
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,486
Stick to cooking.

457
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:05,791
My wife.

458
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:08,095
I beg her to let me
get her a maid.

459
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:10,328
Why should you spend
your whole day in the kitchen?

460
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:12,529
Of course I spend
my whole day in the kitchen.

461
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,231
I'm afraid to step out
of the kitchen,

462
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:16,173
because I'm afraid
of Vito and Frankie.

463
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:19,110
I'm their mother,
but still I'm afraid of them.

464
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:22,012
People are afraid of you
if you are a killer.

465
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:24,174
Vito and Frankie
are not killers.

466
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:25,376
Of course they're killers.

467
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:26,883
Who says they're not killers?

468
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:28,852
What, because they haven't
killed anyone?

469
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,683
That's because
you haven't asked them.

470
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:31,780
Vito!
Vito, get in here.

471
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:32,949
Mama, this is-

472
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,118
I'm frightened
just thinking about them.

473
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,127
Vito, your father

474
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:37,651
wants you
to kill someone.

475
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:38,889
She's crazy, Vito.

476
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,932
I'm not crazy;
tell him, Victor.

477
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,297
Mama,
what are you doing?

478
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,796
Red wine instead of marsala?

479
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:47,134
We talked about this.

480
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:49,003
The wine is going
to overpower the veaI.

481
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,100
I don't know
what you're talk-

482
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,804
I don't know what
he's talking about.

483
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:55,074
He's never talked
about marsala with me.

484
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,478
Go back upstairs, please.

485
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:58,140
Go. You hear me?
Go.

486
00:21:58,183 --> 00:21:59,912
Boys, tell my husband.

487
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:01,333
Tell him-

488
00:22:01,368 --> 00:22:02,715
Mama, enough.

489
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:04,847
Don't try to put Stephen
and Danny in the middle.

490
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,585
Maybe Vito and Frankie
aren't cut out

491
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,023
to go into the business.

492
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,085
Maybe they should do
something else.

493
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,722
Vito is a talented cook
and a baker.

494
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:14,664
And have you seen some

495
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,361
of the clothes
that Frankie has made?

496
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:18,369
May God forgive you
for what you're saying.

497
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:20,371
Frankie doesn't want

498
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:21,463
to sew clothes.

499
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,030
Storia finita.

500
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:24,940
Of course he does!

501
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:27,240
Sophie, didn't Frankie
make you this blouse?

502
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,873
Um...

503
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:31,883
no, no, he bought it.

504
00:22:31,918 --> 00:22:33,874
In a store.

505
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:34,943
Mommy!

506
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:36,886
Mary, it's time to go home.

507
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:40,517
Ciao bella.

508
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:45,025
Ah!

509
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:48,066
Don't worry about Vito
and Frankie, Stella.

510
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,431
Before I die,
they'll be ready

511
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,903
to take their place
in the business.

512
00:22:51,938 --> 00:22:53,063
Stop talking

513
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:54,231
about dying, Papa.

514
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:55,238
You see how upset

515
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:57,070
it makes Stephen and Danny.

516
00:22:57,109 --> 00:23:00,374
Besides, I've got something
I want to tell you.

517
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:02,073
Mommy?

518
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:03,411
Yes, sweetie?

519
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:06,713
How come Uncle Danny
and Uncle Stephen live together?

520
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,652
Well, because
they love each other

521
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,950
like Mommy and Daddy love
each other.

522
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:14,014
Which one's the mommy,
and which one's the daddy?

523
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:18,824
I'll have to get back to you
on that one, honey.

524
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:21,590
Jenny.

525
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:22,725
Engaged?

526
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,395
That's not a Sicilian name.

527
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:27,564
Papa, this is one of the reasons
I didn't want to tell you.

528
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:29,197
He isn't Sicilian.

529
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,401
He isn't Italian.

530
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:32,069
He's not even Catholic.

531
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:35,046
He's an Episcopalian,
and he comes from Wisconsin.

532
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:37,446
Not Sicilian?

533
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:39,006
You never even
mentioned him.

534
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,847
We both decided
not to tell our parents

535
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:42,251
until we were engaged.

536
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:43,584
Not Italian?

537
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:46,715
What does he do,
this Damon?

538
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,783
He's an editor
at Random House.

539
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,555
What's Episcopalian?

540
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,119
Protestant, Stella.

541
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:53,495
He's not Catholic?

542
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:54,827
Jenny, engaged?

543
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:56,561
And what does his family do?

544
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,398
They're good people.

545
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,528
From the heartland.

546
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,538
Soldiers!

547
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:03,939
The planning stage
is finally over.

548
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:07,001
The great day
is finally upon us.

549
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:09,171
It is time to take action.

550
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:11,444
Sons and daughters
of the colonists

551
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:13,007
must rise up, rise up!

552
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:14,016
Sit down, Matt.

553
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:15,780
The second
American revolution

554
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:18,289
will start in the city
of bankers

555
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:20,450
and lawyers and fleshpots
and sex clubs.

556
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:24,493
They don't stand a chance!

557
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,324
Hello.

558
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:31,334
Hello?

559
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:32,335
Oh, hi, Mom.

560
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:34,065
What?

561
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:36,130
I said, "Hi, Mom. "

562
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,802
You have to speak louder,;
it's very noisy here.

563
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:39,811
Sorry.

564
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:41,369
What is all that noise?

565
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:42,879
That's why I'm calling.

566
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:46,008
Your father and I have decided
to surprise you.

567
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,018
What?

568
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,542
Well, let me
put it this way:

569
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,851
we're cruising comfortably
at-what is it, Jack?

570
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:53,481
29,000 feet.

571
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:56,551
Mom, are you on a plane?

572
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,693
Guess where
we're headed?

573
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:02,029
Where?

574
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:03,932
It's your father's birthday
Saturday,

575
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:06,335
so since he hasn't seen you
in such a long time,

576
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:09,499
we decided the perfect gift
would be a trip to New York

577
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:11,007
to visit you and Danny.

578
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:14,444
Can you pick us up
at the airport?

579
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:17,846
The John F. Kennedy
airport at 2:30.

580
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:19,976
You know how nervous I am
about New York,

581
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:22,281
and to have to get
into a taxi-

582
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,821
Stephen?

583
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,755
I'm still here, Mom.

584
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,052
One more question.

585
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:28,582
Do you have any jobs
Saturday?

586
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,922
Jobs?

587
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:31,485
Catering jobs.

588
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:32,587
Uh, no.

589
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:34,222
Since it's
your father's birthday,

590
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,257
wouldn't it be nice
to give him a big dinner party?

591
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:38,462
You know,
invite all your friends.

592
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:39,800
That way, we can meet them

593
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,463
and the people
who work for you.

594
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:42,530
People who work for us?

595
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:44,040
The cooks and bakers.

596
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:45,565
You know, the whole company.

597
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,635
Plus your father and I
will get a chance

598
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,237
to sample your cooking.

599
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:51,272
We're going to be so proud.

600
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:54,478
Mom?

601
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:56,384
I don't think
this is such a great idea,

602
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:58,321
a whole big dinner like that.

603
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,086
Don't be silly;
it'll be just the thing.

604
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:02,753
Your father's very excited
about it.

605
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:03,886
Aren't you, dear?

606
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:04,918
He's very excited.

607
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,627
I still do not understand.

608
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,190
What is the problem?

609
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,964
Bruno, my parents don't know

610
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:12,969
about us.

611
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:15,472
What, that you two
are a couple?

612
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:17,372
They think you share
the same apartment

613
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,343
and you don't sleep
together?

614
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,343
Oh, Stephen.

615
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,845
Your mother's
a grown woman.

616
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,744
Don't be ridiculous;
they know that.

617
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:25,407
They don't know
what we do.

618
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:28,044
Oh, they think we run
a catering business.

619
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:30,178
A catering business,
how can that be?

620
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:31,313
You can't even cook.

621
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:33,921
I keep hearing that.

622
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,859
If you hadn't agreed
to the birthday party,

623
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,417
you'd have nothing
to worry about.

624
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:38,429
Do you have any idea

625
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:40,090
how many weapons we have
in our house?

626
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:42,429
Don't take them in the rooms
where you keep the stuff.

627
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:43,661
It's all the rooms.

628
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:45,703
Can't you put it all
in one place for a few days?

629
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:47,432
That's what
the Branch Davidians did.

630
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:49,064
You think if they stayed
in a hotel-

631
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,471
They are not staying
in a hotel.

632
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:51,736
Would you just listen
to me?

633
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,107
You can hide
the weapons.

634
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:54,873
You do it every time
the police come by.

635
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:55,970
You can do it now.

636
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:57,571
So what about the dinner?

637
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:59,480
Do what Mickey and Judy
would have done.

638
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:00,483
Mickey?

639
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:01,484
Rooney.

640
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:02,520
Judy?

641
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:04,545
Garland.

642
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:05,578
Mickey and Judy?

643
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:06,589
Miss Garland to you.

644
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:08,057
Mickey and Judy
were never-

645
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:10,152
What did they do
when they were in any fix?

646
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,288
A surefire solution
to all of life's problems.

647
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:16,665
They put on a show.

648
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:18,566
Aw.

649
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:22,005
Stephen, a big, elaborate
ruse like this,

650
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:24,007
it's just going to dig us
deeper and deeper.

651
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:25,906
Danny, there's something
you don't know.

652
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:29,071
It's about my father.

653
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:31,344
The FBl.

654
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:32,349
The FBl?

655
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:35,478
I thought he was
a carpet salesman.

656
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,782
That's what
he tells people.

657
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,379
He's undercover,
deep cover.

658
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:40,914
Spies, assassinations,
I don't know.

659
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,186
But, Stephen, the FBl?

660
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:43,194
What will people say?

661
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:44,320
Now you see why
we can't-

662
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:45,590
He's not
a carpet salesman.

663
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:46,597
All this time.

664
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:47,655
We can't let him know.

665
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:49,326
We talked
about carpeting together.

666
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:50,333
He'd have to turn us in.

667
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:51,334
Color schemes.

668
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,200
He'd be consorting
with known criminals.

669
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:54,205
Swatches.

670
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:55,536
We'd go to jail.

671
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:57,837
I thought he'd help us
recarpet the living room.

672
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:59,467
Are you hearing
one word I'm saying?

673
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,103
You lived with this
all this time.

674
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:02,204
Why didn't you tell me?

675
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:04,238
He made me swear.
Even my mother doesn't know.

676
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:07,079
He only told me 'cause I found
an Uzi hidden in the cellar.

677
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:09,450
TR-6 from '81
with a repeating device.

678
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,453
Cool.

679
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,819
I didn't believe him
at first,

680
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,653
so he showed me
around the headquarters,

681
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:16,125
which was outstanding.

682
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:17,958
You should see
the stuff they have.

683
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,054
Cool; I still can't believe
you didn't tell me.

684
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:21,063
Danny, I couldn't.

685
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:23,123
I told you-
I told you about-

686
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,999
What could you possibly
have told me about

687
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,560
that is any way comparable
to this.

688
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:28,071
You know.

689
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:32,340
That you had a girlfriend
in college?

690
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,605
Well, that and-

691
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:35,442
The two of you had sex?

692
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:40,646
Danny, Danny, if my father
finds out about us,

693
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:41,879
he'd have to turn us in.

694
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:43,181
Except you know he wouldn't;

695
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:45,449
he'd turn in
his own badge first.

696
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,152
Well, we can't let him
do that.

697
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:52,561
Poor old guy.

698
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:54,861
Well, we'd have to quit
the family,

699
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,366
I mean really quit for good.

700
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,294
And you know what.

701
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:01,895
It'd break
the Padrone's heart.

702
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:03,873
Without the family
behind us-

703
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,637
We've stepped
on so many toes.

704
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:08,225
Now those people
are afraid of us,

705
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,773
but if we ever leave
the family...

706
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:13,716
our lives wouldn't be worth
a stick of gum, Danny.

707
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,281
Not a stick of gum.

708
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,289
Well, he has to be told.

709
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:26,524
We can't let him find out
some other way.

710
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:29,158
Do you want me
to tell him?

711
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,258
Yes.

712
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:32,360
Okay, first of all,
make sure he understands-

713
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:34,337
Papa!

714
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:36,808
Stephen and Danny
have something

715
00:29:36,843 --> 00:29:38,036
they want to tell you.

716
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,939
I'll get right to the point, Padrone.

717
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:46,146
It's about my-my parents.

718
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:47,616
Yes, how are they, Stephen?

719
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:49,142
Good, good,
they're good.

720
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,812
You know, I'd like to meet them.

721
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:53,153
When do you think
that'll happen?

722
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:55,749
Soon.
The thing is, Padrone,

723
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:58,660
I haven't been totally honest
with them.

724
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,163
Not honest?

725
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:04,395
You might even say
I've lied to them

726
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:07,165
about certain aspects
of my life.

727
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:09,138
My intentions were good,

728
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:10,971
and I think
I had good reason,

729
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:13,875
but the fact remains
that I lied.

730
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:18,109
And I now know,
I truly believe

731
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,116
that this was wrong.

732
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:24,417
Stephen, I know
what you're getting at.

733
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:27,117
And I want you to know
that although I think,

734
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,388
you know, as a rule,
children should never lie

735
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,449
to their parents,

736
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,894
I can understand
what you did.

737
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:33,021
Really, Padrone?

738
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:34,656
You know, I, of course,

739
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:37,463
am very comfortable with
your and Danny's relationship.

740
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,528
But then I'm
a sophisticated man.

741
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:41,630
I live in a big city,

742
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:42,901
whereas they're from...

743
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:43,906
Indiana. Um-

744
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:45,738
Your parents may need time.

745
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:46,891
Maybe they need

746
00:30:46,926 --> 00:30:48,006
to meet Danny

747
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:50,240
and see what a wonderful thing
you have together.

748
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:51,475
To tell you the truth-

749
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,212
Do you think it would help
if I spoke to them?

750
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:56,753
Padrone...

751
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:59,188
I haven't told them
about all of this.

752
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:02,921
I haven't told them
about you.

753
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,968
He's hurt.

754
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:12,060
His feelings are hurt.

755
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:13,297
He understood.

756
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:15,431
If not, he wouldn't
have okayed our plan.

757
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:16,700
"Our" plan?

758
00:31:16,741 --> 00:31:18,106
Jenny, you should-
Stephen.

759
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:20,736
You spend all your time
taking care of us.

760
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:23,144
Now it's time for us
to help you for a change.

761
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,341
It's just, I've never
disappointed them before.

762
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:26,348
It's hard.

763
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:27,611
Pardon me.

764
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:30,348
But you make
a beautiful couple.

765
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:32,912
Thank you.

766
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:41,532
Wish we didn't have
to strip down like this.

767
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:42,897
They're going to want
to hug us.

768
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:44,697
I feel naked.

769
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,136
I've already said you could
bring your brass knuckles.

770
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:52,473
Want to take your ankle piece?

771
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:53,669
Take your ankle piece.

772
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:01,949
I think
you missed one, dear.

773
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:05,012
What?
Oh, yeah.

774
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:07,752
Remember, Matt, every weapon
we leave behind

775
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:10,761
gives us one less weapon
to fight the enemy.

776
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:12,126
Yeah.

777
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:13,562
Now, remember,

778
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,226
it's Don Patrizzi,
not "mister. "

779
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:19,327
There's nothing
to worry about.

780
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,496
If you want to worry,

781
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:22,630
then worry about meeting
and Stephen and Danny.

782
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,471
Why, you think they'll make
a pass at me?

783
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:25,476
No.

784
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,772
But they will kill you

785
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:28,779
if they think
you're not treating me right.

786
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,692
I thought we could go
to the hotel first

787
00:32:40,727 --> 00:32:42,592
and drop off the bags.

788
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,094
Hotel?
Mom, you're staying here.

789
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,755
Oh, we don't want you
to feel cramped.

790
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,230
We're not going
to feel cramped.

791
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:48,731
There's plenty
of room.

792
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,597
How much room can there be
in an apartment?

793
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,932
It's not
an apartment, Mom.

794
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:53,129
We have the whole house.

795
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:55,832
Oh, pardon me.

796
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:57,636
My!

797
00:32:57,709 --> 00:33:00,906
Look at this.

798
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:02,037
All this

799
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:03,980
from catering?

800
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:05,039
The funny thing is,

801
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:07,018
I didn't know Stephen knew
how to cook.

802
00:33:07,053 --> 00:33:10,078
Look at these ceilings.

803
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:13,454
It's going to be hard to go back
to our place, Jack, after this.

804
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:15,151
It'll seem so small.

805
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:17,285
Look at these floors.

806
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:20,161
Oh, and those windows!

807
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:23,029
How do you keep the place warm
in the winter?

808
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:25,262
Well, I guess
when you're young-

809
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:28,567
Oh, look at you!

810
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:30,800
Oh, what a sweetheart.

811
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,777
Oh, do they really
make you run

812
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,748
up and and down
all these stairs?

813
00:33:36,783 --> 00:33:39,239
No wonder
you're so skinny.

814
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:41,745
My god!

815
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:43,617
How many soaps and lotions
do you need

816
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:45,144
to wash yourself
every day?

817
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,158
Well, you know,
there's different products

818
00:33:47,193 --> 00:33:48,124
for day and evening.

819
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,956
You know, dry weather,
rainy weather.

820
00:33:49,994 --> 00:33:51,894
Sometimes your hair
just gets oily

821
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:53,089
for no reason at all, and-

822
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:55,031
You mean to tell me

823
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:59,264
your hair needs both
rosemary mint equalizing

824
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:00,292
conditioning rinse

825
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,271
and freeze and shine
super spray?

826
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:04,866
And what is this word,
"jo-jo-ba"?

827
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:06,376
Jojoba.

828
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:08,038
How do you keep track
of all of this?

829
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,637
Oh, it's alphabetized.

830
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,170
Alphabetized?

831
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,409
Well, so it is.

832
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:13,415
Jack, did you hear?

833
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:15,452
It's alphabetized.

834
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:16,452
I heard.

835
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:17,784
Please get up.

836
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:19,619
Oh, yes.

837
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:22,215
I haven't seen
any closets.

838
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:24,523
Ah...

839
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:26,529
My god!

840
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:28,656
You have more clothes
than I do,

841
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,166
and I'm a woman.

842
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:32,328
Men can have a lot
of clothes too, Mom.

843
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,427
So I see.

844
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:35,062
And, you know,
Stephen's an autumn,

845
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:38,405
and I'm a spring, so we really
can't share anything.

846
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:04,162
They used to have
dance marathons here

847
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:06,032
in the '30s.

848
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:08,800
My father closed it up
years ago.

849
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,831
I haven't been here
since I was a little girl.

850
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:16,479
Wow, look at this.

851
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:21,541
These moldings, the columns.

852
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:22,610
The chandelier!

853
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:26,817
Is there anyplace else,
Jenny?

854
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:29,918
A better place than this
for your banquet?

855
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,826
You're kidding,
right?

856
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:35,390
Well, it looks like
it could use a little work.

857
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:38,999
Well, we'll hire
a decorator

858
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,037
to spruce it up.

859
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:41,902
We'll get a professional chef.

860
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,531
The place has a great kitchen.

861
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:44,723
And how's this?

862
00:35:44,758 --> 00:35:45,872
We'll get the guys

863
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,775
to serve the dinner.

864
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,245
You really think
they'd do that?

865
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,542
Stephen, trust me.

866
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:52,014
They love you.

867
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:53,846
They don't just work
for you,;

868
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:55,182
they would die for you.

869
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:57,187
They'll certainly do this
for you.

870
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:58,279
No way!

871
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,687
I don't think so.

872
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:04,756
All right, all right, enough.

873
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:08,788
And after all
that Stephen and Danny have done for you.

874
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:15,101
Eddie, who talked
to your son's football coach

875
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:17,130
when he wasn't letting
your son play enough?

876
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:19,469
Stephen and Danny.

877
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,034
How often
does your son play now?

878
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:24,506
Every game.

879
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:25,538
What?

880
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:27,516
Every game.

881
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:29,850
And Leo.

882
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,479
Who made
your daughter's boyfriend

883
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:32,853
leave town and never come back?

884
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:34,516
Stephen and Danny.

885
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:35,526
Who?

886
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,891
Stephen and Danny.

887
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:38,589
Mm-hmm.

888
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:41,063
And you, Chuck.

889
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:42,565
Remember when that casino

890
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:44,123
wouldn't give you credit
anymore?

891
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:46,830
Who went and had a pow-wow
with the chief?

892
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,736
Stephen and Danny.

893
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:50,172
How much credit
do they give you now?

894
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:51,208
10 grand.

895
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:52,368
How much?

896
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:54,206
10 grand.

897
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:59,539
And may God forgive you all
for not saying "yes" right away.

898
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:12,189
You know, it's not
the cooking part

899
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:13,230
that bothers me.

900
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:14,959
It's making believe we're gay.

901
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:16,892
Gay?

902
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:18,196
Why gay?

903
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:20,294
Come on, a catering company
in Manhattan

904
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:21,861
run by two gay guys?

905
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,100
Stephen and Danny run

906
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:24,106
the family.

907
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:25,574
We're not gay.

908
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:26,577
Yeah,

909
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:27,703
but we're soldiers.

910
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:29,871
Here, we're talking
about pastry chefs.

911
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:30,881
I can't do gay.

912
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,280
I think I could pull it off.

913
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:33,943
How am I supposed to do gay?

914
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:37,182
Act like Stephen and Danny.

915
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:38,916
They act like the rest of us.

916
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,457
Well, they dress nicer.

917
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:42,288
They dance
a little different too.

918
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:43,293
They're cuter.

919
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:44,294
I don't want

920
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:45,590
to take any chances.

921
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,962
Jenny's mad enough
at us already.

922
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,694
We're not going to take
any chances.

923
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:51,634
We need an expert.

924
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:55,635
What?

925
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:58,504
I think I know someone.

926
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:01,170
For those of you
who haven't yet been acquainted,

927
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:03,077
this is Mr. Grayson.

928
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,979
Good friend
of Stephen and Danny's.

929
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:07,007
Some of youse may have
seen him around the club.

930
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:08,780
Well, I think I've met
some of you there.

931
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:11,219
Well, Ray I remember,
of course.

932
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:14,053
And, let's see.

933
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,319
You were there.

934
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:18,509
And you were there.

935
00:38:18,544 --> 00:38:20,358
And you were there too.

936
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:23,456
Judy Garland.

937
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,528
The Wizard of Oz.

938
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:33,037
We've got a lot
of work to do.

939
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:35,067
Jenny.

940
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:39,474
What is he doing here?

941
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:43,418
You said you'd get
a professional chef.

942
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:44,853
Vito's a chef.

943
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:48,723
Did it ever occur to you

944
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:50,317
to stop being
my father's slave

945
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:51,350
and actually think

946
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:53,226
for a minute?

947
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,662
To my father,

948
00:38:57,702 --> 00:39:00,569
everything you touch
turns to gold.

949
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:02,333
If he sees Vito
pull this off,

950
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:04,500
see Vito save the day
for you and Danny,

951
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:06,042
he'll look at him
differently.

952
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:09,080
Maybe he'll actually start
to respect him a little.

953
00:39:09,115 --> 00:39:10,775
Would that be
so bad?

954
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:12,248
We're not doing this

955
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:13,272
to your father, Jenny.

956
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:14,841
You'd be helping him.

957
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:17,012
Will you at least think
about it?

958
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:23,021
Okay.

959
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:24,186
Vito, did you hear?

960
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:25,286
Stephen says it's okay!

961
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:27,092
And Frankie will do up
the room.

962
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:28,098
Frankie!
What?

963
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:29,394
Frankie, get in here!

964
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:33,231
Frankie.

965
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:34,293
What are you doing here?

966
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:38,067
Nothin'.

967
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:39,838
We're having a big party
for 50 people,

968
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,537
and you're going
to decorate it.

969
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:43,739
You mean choose
the color scheme,

970
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:45,008
the fabrics,
everything?

971
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,016
Choose?

972
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,312
We want you
to make them.

973
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:50,250
Don't mess in my brain,
Jenny.

974
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:51,253
No.

975
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:52,254
Vito, is this true?

976
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:53,881
And I am cooking.

977
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:55,152
You're-

978
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:58,485
Yeah!

979
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:06,968
It's good.
It's good.

980
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,338
Let's start with the basics.

981
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:31,421
97, 98, 99, 100.

982
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:36,256
Now, it's very important

983
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,098
that you call feel
some connection to gay history.

984
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:41,297
Mr. Elton John.

985
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:46,172
Miss Ellen DeGeneres.

986
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,473
Miss J. Edgar Hoover.

987
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:56,514
Some 17th-century queen.

988
00:40:58,222 --> 00:40:59,849
Shirley Booth as Hazel.

989
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:04,991
Last but by no means least,

990
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:06,496
Wishbone.

991
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:20,468
Maybe if you had come
to me first.

992
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:22,012
It is my sons
we're talking about.

993
00:41:22,047 --> 00:41:22,978
Papa, be reasonable.

994
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:24,878
Jenny, you heard
your father.

995
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:26,849
As if they would even
have time.

996
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:28,009
Vito will probably
be out

997
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:29,314
doing a contract
on someone,

998
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:32,323
and Frankie will be out
stealing something.

999
00:41:32,358 --> 00:41:33,415
Stella,

1000
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:36,858
maybe if Vito can cook
for a party like this-

1001
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:38,622
And leave the family business
for good?

1002
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,027
They're not children
anymore.

1003
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:41,031
Then you need to start

1004
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:42,862
letting them do more
in the business.

1005
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:44,696
Papa's tried, Mama.

1006
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:46,903
He's tried.

1007
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:48,632
Basta!

1008
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:53,043
This is for Stephen and Danny.

1009
00:41:53,078 --> 00:41:54,044
We'll do it for them.

1010
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:55,705
Come, Stella.

1011
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:57,873
You'll buy a new dress, hmm?

1012
00:41:57,948 --> 00:41:59,347
Frankie said he wanted

1013
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:01,351
to make you one.

1014
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:04,744
You'll be
the prettiest woman there.

1015
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:06,517
And you know who
I'll invite also?

1016
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:09,617
The senator.

1017
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:12,857
The senator.
Mm-hmm.

1018
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:15,695
Well, Victor, let's see.

1019
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:16,755
I, uh-

1020
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,767
Pete, are you there?

1021
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:22,204
Uh, it just isn't
a good night.

1022
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:24,707
Yeah, you see,
I have this...

1023
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:25,742
thing.

1024
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:27,607
Is someone there with you,
Pete?

1025
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:28,975
No, Victor.

1026
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:33,643
Pete, I wonder how my father
would handle this.

1027
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:36,209
I think he would have said,

1028
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:38,414
"Peter, do you know

1029
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:42,152
"what you are to me
besides being my friend?

1030
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:46,151
"You're like a bank,
a favor bank.

1031
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:50,724
I put the favors in;
I take the favors out. "

1032
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:52,735
What do you think, Pete?

1033
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:53,895
Have I done favors for you?

1034
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:55,963
Yes, Victor, but-

1035
00:42:56,006 --> 00:43:00,636
"Now, what would you say
if I put money in a bank,

1036
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:03,145
"and when I tried
to take it out,

1037
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:05,681
the banker told me I couldn't?"

1038
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:07,445
Well, I-of course,
I would-

1039
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:09,577
What happened to the money,
Pete?

1040
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,053
Did it disappear?

1041
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:13,146
Did it get up and walk away?

1042
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:15,748
I mean,
if the money isn't there,

1043
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:19,523
it's because someone stole it.

1044
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:21,224
"The banker?

1045
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,426
The banker stole my money?"

1046
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:27,237
What do you think should happen
to such a person, Pete?

1047
00:43:27,272 --> 00:43:29,797
Well, I-I-I can't-

1048
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,671
8:00.

1049
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:32,674
And don't be late.

1050
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:37,476
8:00.

1051
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:40,346
Yes, Victor,
I look forward to it.

1052
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:42,079
Right.

1053
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:44,086
See you then.
Bye-bye.

1054
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:52,222
I'm so glad the three of you
are finally meeting.

1055
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:56,089
Jenny,

1056
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:58,157
can we talk to you
for a second?

1057
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:06,199
Do you ever think
about anybody but yourself?

1058
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:07,334
What?

1059
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:08,470
You never told us anything

1060
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:09,706
about this relationship.

1061
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,680
It's as if, mentally,
you've already left.

1062
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:13,410
You two, what am I going
to do with you?

1063
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,386
And we don't know
the first thing about him.

1064
00:44:15,421 --> 00:44:16,484
Is he even nice to you?

1065
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:17,547
He's very nice to me.

1066
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:19,249
You don't know
what men are like.

1067
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:20,813
She doesn't know
what men are like.

1068
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:22,051
But if he wants trouble-

1069
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:23,150
We'll give him
trouble.

1070
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:24,854
Kill him.

1071
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:25,884
I swear
we'll kill him.

1072
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:27,055
You think
we're kidding?

1073
00:44:27,097 --> 00:44:28,359
We'll mess him up.

1074
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:30,560
And there's nothing you can say
that will stop us.

1075
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:33,365
Oh, you two.

1076
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:35,167
We love you, Jenny.

1077
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:40,333
Damon.

1078
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:44,073
Congratulations.

1079
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:50,179
Welcome to the family.

1080
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:56,183
You've got to cancel,
Senator.

1081
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:58,126
You'll be crucified
in the media.

1082
00:44:58,162 --> 00:45:01,029
Well, Jesus
was crucified too.

1083
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:03,829
Okay, but I'm going with you
to that dinner.

1084
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,835
Understood?
Tim-

1085
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:09,430
I am going with you
to that dinner.

1086
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:11,304
Hmm?

1087
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:21,075
Well, what did I tell you?

1088
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:22,846
Stephen and Danny,
aren't they great?

1089
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,717
Yeah, they sure do talk.

1090
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:27,485
Well, they do more
than just talk.

1091
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:30,316
What's the matter?

1092
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:33,386
It's just, this is all
so new to me,

1093
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:36,228
this atmosphere
of violence.

1094
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,992
Well, good morning,
you two.

1095
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:14,333
Good morning,
Mom.

1096
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:16,429
Morning, boys.

1097
00:46:19,009 --> 00:46:20,840
Please don't feed him
from the table, Mom.

1098
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:23,471
I could get used
to having a maid around.

1099
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:25,345
Please don't feed him
from the table, Mom.

1100
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:27,783
Monty, corner.

1101
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:30,116
You two got in late
last night.

1102
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:31,348
We were working.

1103
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:32,513
Till 3:00 in the morning?

1104
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:34,921
It was a big job.

1105
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,256
You told us you didn't have
any parties this week.

1106
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:39,090
Well, this one came up
at the last minute.

1107
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,357
It was an emergency.

1108
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,261
An emergency party?

1109
00:46:42,332 --> 00:46:44,129
We should really
get going.

1110
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:45,499
What are you
working on today?

1111
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:48,601
Oh, the usual.

1112
00:46:48,636 --> 00:46:51,667
Salads, stews.

1113
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:52,674
Coffee.

1114
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:53,675
Pomegranates.

1115
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:54,676
You know.

1116
00:46:54,745 --> 00:46:56,906
Ooh!

1117
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:02,652
Stephen.

1118
00:47:02,686 --> 00:47:04,085
Who's there?

1119
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,086
Stephen, honey.

1120
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:06,281
Mom, what is it?

1121
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:08,256
I have a question to ask you.
May I come in?

1122
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:10,453
I can hear you just fine.

1123
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,223
Well, I can't hear you.
Can I come in?

1124
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:14,059
It's a mess in here.

1125
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:15,064
Come downstairs.

1126
00:47:15,098 --> 00:47:16,656
We can't, Mom;
we're in a hurry.

1127
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,395
Of all the foolish-

1128
00:47:18,468 --> 00:47:19,901
We've got a-

1129
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:21,460
Why is this door locked?

1130
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,974
Mom, we've got
all our stuff in here.

1131
00:47:24,009 --> 00:47:25,202
It's kind of private.

1132
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:29,910
Ada, can't this wait till later?

1133
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:33,174
I know what they must be doing.

1134
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:38,186
At this hour?

1135
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:40,019
They said they had to leave.

1136
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:41,853
That maid of theirs
is with them.

1137
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,354
We're not in Indiana anymore.

1138
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:49,299
Two words, honey:

1139
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:51,460
puh-lease.

1140
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,605
Two words, honey:

1141
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,902
please.

1142
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:02,410
Two words, honey:

1143
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:04,937
puh-lease!

1144
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,277
Two words, honey:

1145
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,685
please?

1146
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:13,747
Ooh, ooh!

1147
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:14,756
Can I try?

1148
00:48:14,825 --> 00:48:16,656
Yes, come on.

1149
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:25,397
Two words, honey:

1150
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:27,426
puh-lease!

1151
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:38,673
Eggshell.

1152
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:39,943
I said eggshell.

1153
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:41,952
Does this look
like eggshell to you?

1154
00:48:41,987 --> 00:48:43,351
I can't make napkins
from this.

1155
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:47,853
Have you thought about that?

1156
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:50,359
I mean, you know how some
gay men call each other "her. "

1157
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:52,294
"Forget her. " Her.

1158
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:54,194
"Such a queen. "

1159
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:55,993
What about lesbians?
Do they use "him"?

1160
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:57,658
"Forget him. "

1161
00:48:57,701 --> 00:48:59,168
"He's such a king. "

1162
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:01,727
Richard, do you mind sitting
next to Cynthia St. Charles?

1163
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,364
Or Freddie the Chin.

1164
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:08,478
I'd rather drink ink.

1165
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:10,876
Now, about that dinner.

1166
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:13,212
I've got to go
to a costume party first.

1167
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:14,272
It's a benefit.

1168
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:15,945
You're going to make it,
aren't you?

1169
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:16,987
Well, I'll be late.

1170
00:49:17,022 --> 00:49:17,953
Figure around 10:00.

1171
00:49:17,988 --> 00:49:19,080
Well, don't be
too late.

1172
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,487
It's going to be a blast.

1173
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:24,585
@ His truth
is marching on. @

1174
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:27,995
@ Glory, glory,
hallelujah. @ @

1175
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:30,022
You sure you want to do this?

1176
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,226
Vito, we can handle it;
we want to help,

1177
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:33,201
and we should know something
about the food

1178
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:34,965
in case Stephen's parents
ask about it.

1179
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:38,435
Okay.

1180
00:49:38,508 --> 00:49:42,968
Now, the most complicated part
of the dinner

1181
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:44,310
is the dessert.

1182
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:49,242
Ricotta cheesecake.

1183
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,344
Now, I'm going to go see
if the ricotta's here.

1184
00:49:51,421 --> 00:49:52,854
Meanwhile, you can start

1185
00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:54,481
by heating this up.

1186
00:49:56,426 --> 00:49:57,984
Uh, Vito?

1187
00:49:58,028 --> 00:50:00,553
Uh, just nuke it.

1188
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:02,393
In the microwave.

1189
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:25,947
Maybe it's this one:
"meal reheat. "

1190
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:27,456
I mean, they have
to have heated it

1191
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:28,958
before they
condensed it, right?

1192
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:30,482
Yeah.

1193
00:50:34,064 --> 00:50:35,190
Whoa, whoa.

1194
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:37,665
Think we should put them in
with the wrappers?

1195
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:40,468
Yeah, why not?

1196
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:45,106
Vito,
are we supposed

1197
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:46,403
to put the cans in

1198
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:47,773
with the wrappers,
without the wrappers,

1199
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:49,540
or doesn't it really
make a difference?

1200
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:51,103
I bet it doesn't make
a difference.

1201
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:52,273
What?

1202
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,585
Thanks for doing this again,

1203
00:50:58,622 --> 00:50:59,953
Vito.

1204
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:01,787
No, no,
we're really sorry.

1205
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:03,019
Hey, it's my fault.

1206
00:51:03,093 --> 00:51:04,993
Okay, next time,
it's going to be different,

1207
00:51:05,028 --> 00:51:06,393
'cause
we're totally psyched.

1208
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:09,126
Psyched.

1209
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:10,131
Great.

1210
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,224
Okay, look.

1211
00:51:11,301 --> 00:51:13,929
I've been thinking
about it, guys.

1212
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:17,735
And you shouldn't waste
your time on dessert.

1213
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:20,710
I mean, after all,
it's only dessert, right?

1214
00:51:20,745 --> 00:51:24,612
You should work
on the important stuff,

1215
00:51:24,648 --> 00:51:28,140
like the goose liver pate.

1216
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:32,211
Okay, now, you start
by boiling the eggs.

1217
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,222
Three minutes.

1218
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:34,245
No, no, no.

1219
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:36,519
Now, you see,
this is why it was my fault.

1220
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,323
You use this pan.

1221
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:40,454
Now, you wait
until the water is boiling,

1222
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:43,727
and then you take the eggs,
and you add them.

1223
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:44,927
Three minutes.

1224
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:47,095
Now, after the eggs
are boiled,

1225
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:48,331
you take the goose liver.

1226
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:50,601
It's very expensive.

1227
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,633
And then you mash it in
with the eggs, okay?

1228
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:55,667
Boil the eggs-

1229
00:51:55,745 --> 00:51:56,973
And mash in
the goose liver.

1230
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:00,343
That's it.

1231
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:01,941
So what do we use
to do the mashing?

1232
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,828
Call me
when you're done.

1233
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:15,058
@ Papa loves mambo. @

1234
00:52:16,566 --> 00:52:18,431
@ Mama loves mambo. @

1235
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:20,729
@ Look at them sway with it, @

1236
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:22,260
@ getting so gay with it, @

1237
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:23,738
@ shouting "ole" with it. @

1238
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:25,297
@ Wow. @

1239
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:27,343
@ Papa loves mambo. @

1240
00:52:27,377 --> 00:52:29,675
Ah, that's a good one.

1241
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:32,705
@ Papa does great with it, @

1242
00:52:32,782 --> 00:52:34,044
@ swings like a gate with it. @

1243
00:52:34,084 --> 00:52:35,585
@ He loses weight with it now. @

1244
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:37,052
@ He goes... @

1245
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:38,748
How are you guys doing?

1246
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:40,085
Shh.
No problem.

1247
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:43,849
@ He goes fast. @

1248
00:52:45,295 --> 00:52:47,923
@ She goes slow. @

1249
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:50,796
@ He goes left. @

1250
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,597
@ She goes right. @

1251
00:52:52,636 --> 00:52:53,796
Done?

1252
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:56,328
It's mashed.

1253
00:52:56,406 --> 00:52:58,101
@ Mama is nowhere in sight. @

1254
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:02,034
@ Uh! @ @

1255
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:04,444
There he is,
my boy!

1256
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:06,539
You made it.

1257
00:53:06,616 --> 00:53:09,278
When God is on
your side, son...

1258
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:10,377
What?

1259
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,887
Nothing.

1260
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:14,755
Dear, your father is tired
after a long trip.

1261
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:17,952
Who are all those people?

1262
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,552
People?
What-

1263
00:53:19,629 --> 00:53:20,618
Hmm?

1264
00:53:20,664 --> 00:53:21,631
Oh!

1265
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:23,895
Those people.

1266
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:25,595
Well, that is-

1267
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:28,365
That's our church group.

1268
00:53:28,438 --> 00:53:29,632
They wanted
to see New York,

1269
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:31,470
and they were afraid
they would get lost,

1270
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,600
so they followed us here.

1271
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:35,508
And-not to worry.

1272
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,069
They're staying
in a hotel.

1273
00:53:37,147 --> 00:53:40,048
Well, hi!

1274
00:53:41,284 --> 00:53:42,410
Okay.

1275
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:47,056
Who was she married to
in March 1953?

1276
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:49,255
Michael Wilding.

1277
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:51,658
November 1975?

1278
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:52,719
Richard Burton.

1279
00:53:52,762 --> 00:53:54,423
First marriage
or second?

1280
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:56,227
Second?
Very good.

1281
00:53:56,266 --> 00:53:57,528
January 1952.

1282
00:53:58,468 --> 00:53:59,594
Nicky Hilton.

1283
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:02,604
How could she be married
to Nicky Hilton in 1952

1284
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:04,105
when she divorced him
in 1951?

1285
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:08,870
She wasn't married
to anybody.

1286
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:10,539
She was
in between husbands.

1287
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,480
Right.

1288
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:14,415
Come on, Grayson.
That's a trick question.

1289
00:54:14,484 --> 00:54:16,884
That's not a trick question;
that's basic material.

1290
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,285
The dinner is tomorrow.

1291
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:19,788
Now, pull yourselves
together!

1292
00:54:32,202 --> 00:54:34,102
So when do we get
to meet her?

1293
00:54:34,137 --> 00:54:35,263
Soon.

1294
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:36,829
I didn't want to do
too much at once.

1295
00:54:36,906 --> 00:54:37,964
Oh, well, honey,

1296
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:39,066
don't worry about us.

1297
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,371
We want to see
all the sights.

1298
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:42,970
You know, Wall Street,
Empire State Building,

1299
00:54:43,013 --> 00:54:45,140
City Hall.

1300
00:54:45,215 --> 00:54:49,519
All those big, beautiful
government buildings.

1301
00:54:49,554 --> 00:54:51,646
Especially
the government buildings.

1302
00:54:55,525 --> 00:54:57,686
Because we love
the government.

1303
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:02,889
@ Do mi mi. @

1304
00:55:02,932 --> 00:55:04,559
@ Mi so so. @

1305
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:06,226
@ Re fa fa. @

1306
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:07,236
@ La ti ti. @

1307
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:08,237
@ Do mi mi. @

1308
00:55:08,271 --> 00:55:09,238
@ Mi so so. @

1309
00:55:09,272 --> 00:55:10,330
@ Re fa fa. @ @

1310
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:13,240
So, anyway, a friend of mine
invited me to one

1311
00:55:13,276 --> 00:55:15,938
of her Straight Women Loving
Other Straight Women meetings.

1312
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:16,946
Cheryl!

1313
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:17,947
What?
Cheryl.

1314
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:18,948
What?

1315
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,006
Straight Women Loving

1316
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:21,039
Other Straight Women.

1317
00:55:21,084 --> 00:55:22,608
What the hell is that?

1318
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,347
Like us announcing
we're straight men

1319
00:55:24,387 --> 00:55:25,718
that love
other straight men?

1320
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:27,689
But you and Stephen are gay.

1321
00:55:27,757 --> 00:55:32,562
I mean, this is straight women
who love other straight women.

1322
00:55:32,597 --> 00:55:34,496
Okay.

1323
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:36,191
At least it gets me out
of the house.

1324
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:38,668
You'll get out tomorrow
for our dinner, right?

1325
00:55:38,703 --> 00:55:39,657
Of course.

1326
00:55:39,703 --> 00:55:41,136
How are the preparations coming?

1327
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,672
Perfect.

1328
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:54,047
@ You can sing
most anything. @

1329
00:55:54,082 --> 00:55:58,515
@ Do re mi fa so
la ti do. @

1330
00:55:58,588 --> 00:55:59,748
@ So do. @ @

1331
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:01,416
Oh, you won't be imposing.

1332
00:56:01,491 --> 00:56:02,583
Of course you'll come.

1333
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:04,752
I don't even have
anything to wear.

1334
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:06,091
Yeah, sure you do, dear.

1335
00:56:06,129 --> 00:56:08,927
Remember, you brought that dress
for the victory celebration.

1336
00:56:11,801 --> 00:56:12,768
Ooh.

1337
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:14,599
You know, now
that he mentions it,

1338
00:56:14,637 --> 00:56:16,764
I do have
a little something.

1339
00:56:16,806 --> 00:56:18,000
Oh, good.

1340
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,066
And I can introduce you
to Senator Bloomer.

1341
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:22,544
Senator Bloomer?

1342
00:56:22,612 --> 00:56:23,544
From New York.

1343
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:26,514
A United States
senator?

1344
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:27,573
Uh-huh.

1345
00:56:27,617 --> 00:56:31,018
Tell me, is he
an important senator?

1346
00:56:33,456 --> 00:56:34,855
And he's coming
to your dinner?

1347
00:56:34,924 --> 00:56:36,619
He's a friend
of my father's.

1348
00:56:39,629 --> 00:56:40,960
What does your father do again?

1349
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:43,021
He's in catering
He's a businessman.

1350
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:45,057
Sorry?
What?

1351
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:47,729
He's in the catering
business.

1352
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:49,636
It's his company
that's catering

1353
00:56:49,672 --> 00:56:51,731
the dinner.

1354
00:56:51,775 --> 00:56:53,367
Oh, there's one thing.

1355
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:55,572
This employee
of my father's

1356
00:56:55,645 --> 00:56:57,135
whose parents are going
to be there

1357
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:59,011
told them that it's
actually his company,

1358
00:56:59,048 --> 00:57:00,743
so if you meet them,
don't let on, okay?

1359
00:57:00,784 --> 00:57:02,581
Okay.

1360
00:57:02,652 --> 00:57:03,914
Can you keep a secret?

1361
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:05,944
Oh, I think we can.

1362
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:30,337
I can't stand the idea
of leaving him alone all night.

1363
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:31,904
Honey, we'll be back
in a few hours.

1364
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:33,243
Jack, look at him.

1365
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:35,444
How would you like it
if I left you alone

1366
00:57:35,485 --> 00:57:38,420
for hours with nothing
but a bowl of dog food?

1367
00:57:38,488 --> 00:57:39,546
Ada, he's a dog.

1368
00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:40,613
Come on.

1369
00:57:56,105 --> 00:57:59,336
Oh, God, I can't believe it.

1370
00:58:00,844 --> 00:58:02,641
I thought
you'd seen it already.

1371
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:04,873
Yeah, but not like this.

1372
00:58:04,914 --> 00:58:06,006
Where's Frankie?

1373
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:07,641
We've been looking
all over for him.

1374
00:58:07,717 --> 00:58:10,119
Oh, he couldn't handle it;
he was too nervous.

1375
00:58:10,154 --> 00:58:11,347
I told him
I'd call him later

1376
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:13,082
and tell him
how everything looks.

1377
00:58:26,035 --> 00:58:27,161
Hi.

1378
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:32,967
Those are Victor Patrizzi's
gay lieutenants.

1379
00:58:33,042 --> 00:58:35,567
If they ask you for anything,
the answer is "no. "

1380
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:36,669
Tim, look.

1381
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:37,678
We're here.

1382
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:38,714
You may not like it.

1383
00:58:38,748 --> 00:58:41,114
I may not
like it much either.

1384
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:42,412
But we're here,

1385
00:58:42,452 --> 00:58:44,647
and I intend
to have a good time.

1386
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:46,746
So relax.

1387
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:51,392
Oh!

1388
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:53,452
It's beautiful.

1389
00:58:53,496 --> 00:58:55,987
Did you ever have
such a birthday party

1390
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:57,054
in your life,
Jack?

1391
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:59,864
And look at all of you.

1392
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:02,303
I always say everyone
looks better in black tie.

1393
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,033
You need something.

1394
00:59:04,073 --> 00:59:05,165
A carnation.

1395
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,800
There should be a tray
of carnations

1396
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:08,901
right here so all the men
could have one.

1397
00:59:08,978 --> 00:59:11,037
Wouldn't that make everything
even prettier?

1398
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:14,106
She wants carnations.

1399
00:59:14,183 --> 00:59:15,912
Find some.

1400
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:18,112
Find some carnations.

1401
00:59:18,187 --> 00:59:19,916
Roger that.

1402
00:59:29,098 --> 00:59:32,124
Oh, Damon, dear,
you look so handsome.

1403
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:35,136
And Jenny.

1404
00:59:35,204 --> 00:59:37,331
What a pretty dress.

1405
00:59:38,608 --> 00:59:40,803
Stephen, Danny, these
are Damon's parents.

1406
00:59:40,843 --> 00:59:41,935
How do you do?

1407
00:59:42,011 --> 00:59:43,501
Stephen, Danny,
nice to meet you.

1408
00:59:43,546 --> 00:59:44,911
So, is that senator here?

1409
00:59:44,948 --> 00:59:45,915
Yeah.

1410
00:59:45,949 --> 00:59:47,382
He's right over there.

1411
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:48,577
Would you like
to meet him?

1412
00:59:48,618 --> 00:59:50,483
Uh, no.

1413
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:53,114
No, I just-I wanted
to know where he was.

1414
00:59:53,156 --> 00:59:54,453
Right.

1415
00:59:54,524 --> 00:59:56,321
Shall we?
Nice to meet you.

1416
00:59:56,359 --> 00:59:57,724
What do you think
you're doing?

1417
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,125
Do you want
to give us all away?

1418
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:01,497
Thank you.

1419
01:00:03,866 --> 01:00:05,231
Mom, Dad.

1420
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:06,633
I just wanted
to introduce you

1421
01:00:06,669 --> 01:00:09,502
to Don-Mr. Patrizzi.

1422
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:10,938
Donald.

1423
01:00:10,974 --> 01:00:12,236
It's a pleasure.

1424
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:13,799
Do you work for my son?

1425
01:00:13,843 --> 01:00:16,073
Yes.

1426
01:00:16,145 --> 01:00:17,237
Yes, I do.

1427
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:21,774
But Donald is a very
distinguished member

1428
01:00:21,851 --> 01:00:24,319
of the culinary community.

1429
01:00:24,354 --> 01:00:26,652
And we're very honored

1430
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:28,156
to have him
on our staff.

1431
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:29,283
Well, I can tell

1432
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:30,951
you've made
an excellent impression

1433
01:00:30,994 --> 01:00:32,461
on my son, Donald.

1434
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:35,259
It always helps
to get in good with the boss.

1435
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:37,027
Oh!

1436
01:00:37,066 --> 01:00:38,931
You do have carnations.

1437
01:00:48,177 --> 01:00:49,201
Red? White?

1438
01:00:49,278 --> 01:00:50,472
What are the whites?

1439
01:00:50,513 --> 01:00:55,041
We have Mont Monet,
and we also have Mont Blanc.

1440
01:00:55,084 --> 01:00:57,018
No California whites?

1441
01:00:58,121 --> 01:01:00,453
I just love
California whites.

1442
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,048
Whichever.

1443
01:01:04,894 --> 01:01:06,885
Find some California whites.

1444
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:09,989
So there are 18 seconds to go.

1445
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:11,500
Shaq gets the ball,
drives the-

1446
01:01:11,534 --> 01:01:13,058
Ooh!

1447
01:01:13,102 --> 01:01:15,332
I love
basketball.

1448
01:01:15,405 --> 01:01:17,635
Yeah? Good, so do I.

1449
01:01:17,707 --> 01:01:21,404
My favorite player
was Dennis Rodman.

1450
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:23,469
Oh, Denn-is Rod-man.

1451
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:27,005
Love to get my balls
in his basket.

1452
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:29,050
Sammy.

1453
01:01:37,326 --> 01:01:38,384
Is something
the matter?

1454
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:40,419
I'm fine.

1455
01:01:40,463 --> 01:01:42,454
But it looks like somebody
around here needs

1456
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:44,363
to lose
a little 'tude.

1457
01:01:48,337 --> 01:01:49,429
What's going on?

1458
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:51,497
Is your tiara on
crooked again?

1459
01:01:56,646 --> 01:01:57,578
This is delicious.

1460
01:01:57,647 --> 01:01:58,579
What do you call this?

1461
01:01:58,648 --> 01:02:01,913
Yes, Stephen.

1462
01:02:01,951 --> 01:02:03,077
What is it?

1463
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:04,881
What is the appetizer?

1464
01:02:04,954 --> 01:02:07,252
A California white!

1465
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:08,279
Oh.

1466
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:11,251
Spinach Orloff veloute.

1467
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:13,360
The appetizer.

1468
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:16,229
It's spinach Orloff veloute.

1469
01:02:16,265 --> 01:02:17,459
Oh.

1470
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,695
Well, it's lovely.

1471
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:23,703
Fish... or veal, sir?

1472
01:02:23,773 --> 01:02:25,798
I don't know;
you choose.

1473
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:26,899
What?

1474
01:02:26,976 --> 01:02:29,069
You decide what to give me.

1475
01:02:29,112 --> 01:02:31,580
Oh, I know what I'd like
to give you.

1476
01:02:31,614 --> 01:02:33,479
But it isn't on the menu.

1477
01:02:34,784 --> 01:02:36,581
Eddie.

1478
01:02:36,619 --> 01:02:38,143
Eddie!

1479
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:43,285
What are you doing?

1480
01:02:43,326 --> 01:02:44,315
What do you mean?

1481
01:02:44,393 --> 01:02:46,293
I mean
what are you doing?

1482
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:56,731
Fish or veal, ma'am?

1483
01:02:56,806 --> 01:02:58,137
Oh.

1484
01:02:58,207 --> 01:03:00,141
I hate making these decisions.

1485
01:03:00,209 --> 01:03:01,870
Oh, I know.

1486
01:03:01,911 --> 01:03:03,936
I mean, I like Judy.

1487
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:07,005
But I like Liza too.

1488
01:03:07,049 --> 01:03:08,676
Why should I have
to choose?

1489
01:03:09,852 --> 01:03:11,581
Fish.

1490
01:03:14,223 --> 01:03:17,215
Oh, get over it, Mary.

1491
01:03:29,338 --> 01:03:30,635
Huh?

1492
01:03:30,673 --> 01:03:32,573
Nice.

1493
01:03:33,242 --> 01:03:36,837
@ I know you inside out. @

1494
01:03:36,879 --> 01:03:40,781
@ No doubt what you're about. @

1495
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:45,344
@ You can't surprise me, @

1496
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:49,882
@ so why try? @

1497
01:03:49,959 --> 01:03:55,090
@ Play any trick or ruse. @

1498
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:56,825
@ I'm quick @

1499
01:03:56,866 --> 01:03:58,731
@ to pick up clues. @

1500
01:03:58,768 --> 01:04:00,167
@ You can't @

1501
01:04:00,203 --> 01:04:02,433
@ surprise me. @

1502
01:04:02,471 --> 01:04:03,870
@ You know @

1503
01:04:03,906 --> 01:04:09,243
@ I know each wish @

1504
01:04:09,278 --> 01:04:11,678
@ in your heart, each joy @

1505
01:04:11,714 --> 01:04:13,181
@ in your smile, @

1506
01:04:13,216 --> 01:04:17,346
@ each hurt behind each tear. @

1507
01:04:17,386 --> 01:04:21,083
@ whether you're far @

1508
01:04:21,123 --> 01:04:22,647
@ or near, @

1509
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:23,681
@ I know... @

1510
01:04:23,726 --> 01:04:26,696
Isn't he wonderful?

1511
01:04:26,731 --> 01:04:27,662
She.

1512
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:29,562
Oh, you call them "she. "

1513
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:31,829
I call all women "she. "

1514
01:04:31,901 --> 01:04:33,630
She's a woman?

1515
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,796
I thought
she was a drag queen.

1516
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:37,703
You know, a man dressed
like a woman.

1517
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:39,230
I know what
a drag queen is, Mom.

1518
01:04:39,308 --> 01:04:40,639
Are we going
to see any?

1519
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:42,871
I mean, just plain old women,
I can see in Indiana.

1520
01:04:43,913 --> 01:04:46,438
Oh, well.

1521
01:04:46,515 --> 01:04:48,346
Maybe next time.

1522
01:04:48,417 --> 01:04:52,080
Find some drag queens.

1523
01:04:56,325 --> 01:05:02,628
@... how surprisingly much @

1524
01:05:02,665 --> 01:05:14,443
@ you love me. @ @

1525
01:05:19,148 --> 01:05:20,410
Drag queens?

1526
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:22,212
Where are we going
to find drag queens?

1527
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:24,151
Greenwich Village.

1528
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:27,582
Everybody knows that.

1529
01:05:33,296 --> 01:05:34,923
Danny and I would like
to thank you all

1530
01:05:34,964 --> 01:05:36,477
for coming tonight.

1531
01:05:36,512 --> 01:05:37,990
And I want most of all

1532
01:05:38,067 --> 01:05:41,264
to toast
the birthday boy-person.

1533
01:05:41,304 --> 01:05:44,102
The best father that ever lived,
my father,

1534
01:05:44,173 --> 01:05:46,403
who made us promise not
to sing him Happy Birthday.

1535
01:05:46,475 --> 01:05:47,965
But in his honor,
Vito has-

1536
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:50,103
has helped

1537
01:05:50,179 --> 01:05:52,079
Danny and me bake him a cake.

1538
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:53,274
To my father.

1539
01:05:53,316 --> 01:05:54,305
Buon compleanno.

1540
01:05:54,383 --> 01:05:55,714
Buon
compleanno.

1541
01:06:04,093 --> 01:06:05,788
Ooh, excuse me.

1542
01:06:05,828 --> 01:06:08,388
Do you where we could find
some drag queens around here?

1543
01:06:11,334 --> 01:06:12,926
Come on.

1544
01:06:16,105 --> 01:06:17,231
Excuse me.

1545
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:19,866
You know where we could find
some drag queens?

1546
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:21,638
Girlfriend,
if you have to ask.

1547
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:34,553
I have never seen
such a gorgeous cake.

1548
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:36,682
How did you-

1549
01:06:36,726 --> 01:06:38,887
uh, uh, uh,

1550
01:06:38,928 --> 01:06:41,931
you, I mean
all of you.

1551
01:06:41,966 --> 01:06:42,897
Oh, my God!

1552
01:06:42,932 --> 01:06:44,297
Look at what I've done.

1553
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:45,561
I've ruined

1554
01:06:45,634 --> 01:06:47,693
your beautifuI cake.

1555
01:06:47,737 --> 01:06:49,170
Don't worry, Mama.
Don't worry.

1556
01:06:49,238 --> 01:06:50,500
But it was a work
of art.

1557
01:06:50,539 --> 01:06:52,370
It was perfect.

1558
01:06:52,441 --> 01:06:53,999
Then you did
the right thing.

1559
01:06:56,379 --> 01:06:58,347
We don't want
to offend the gods.

1560
01:07:07,156 --> 01:07:08,714
In ancient Persia,

1561
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:10,487
whenever an artist

1562
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:14,655
created something,
he would include a flaw

1563
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:17,325
on purpose, because

1564
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:20,767
only the gods are supposed
to be perfect.

1565
01:07:20,803 --> 01:07:22,168
And so, today,

1566
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:25,469
we introduce a flaw
into something

1567
01:07:25,508 --> 01:07:30,241
that otherwise would be perfect,
and we say it is

1568
01:07:30,279 --> 01:07:34,181
so as not to offend the gods.

1569
01:07:39,688 --> 01:07:42,020
Mr. Torcelli, a speech.

1570
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:46,725
I'm going to go home
and change this dress.

1571
01:07:46,796 --> 01:07:48,593
Okay, sweetheart.

1572
01:07:48,631 --> 01:07:49,598
Just a few words.

1573
01:07:49,632 --> 01:07:51,031
I'm not prepared for this.

1574
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:52,692
Go ask him.

1575
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:54,600
No,
you go ask him.

1576
01:07:54,637 --> 01:07:55,626
Come on, Leo.

1577
01:07:55,704 --> 01:07:57,763
No,
you ask him.

1578
01:08:07,316 --> 01:08:10,080
Can I help you, sir?

1579
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:12,781
Yeah, any drag queens
around here?

1580
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:15,890
Sure.

1581
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:18,120
There's a place
two blocks down.

1582
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:21,857
It's called
Jacqueline's.

1583
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:24,729
You can't miss it.

1584
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:26,928
You have a good time,
all right?

1585
01:08:26,969 --> 01:08:28,129
Right.

1586
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:35,840
To be honest, nothing
could possibly prepare me

1587
01:08:35,878 --> 01:08:37,311
for tonight.

1588
01:08:37,346 --> 01:08:38,540
It's been quite an evening,

1589
01:08:38,581 --> 01:08:40,811
and I'll remember it
for as long as-

1590
01:08:44,053 --> 01:08:45,020
Don't move!

1591
01:08:46,989 --> 01:08:48,854
Put your hands up!
Hands up!

1592
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:51,892
Mom?

1593
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:53,223
Dad?

1594
01:08:53,262 --> 01:08:54,354
What's going on?

1595
01:08:54,396 --> 01:08:55,795
You too, Damon, honey.

1596
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:56,832
Put your hands up!

1597
01:08:56,866 --> 01:08:58,458
Mrs. Jennings.

1598
01:08:58,501 --> 01:09:00,901
Now, let's not have
any trouble here.

1599
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:02,335
Now, just put
the gun down.

1600
01:09:02,371 --> 01:09:03,463
Don't take another step!

1601
01:09:04,273 --> 01:09:05,205
I will shoot;

1602
01:09:05,274 --> 01:09:06,434
I swear it.

1603
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:08,477
Nobody's going
to shoot anybody.

1604
01:09:08,512 --> 01:09:09,876
We all know that.

1605
01:09:09,912 --> 01:09:11,072
Right, Damon?

1606
01:09:11,113 --> 01:09:12,410
Right.

1607
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:29,430
Okay, see?

1608
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:31,989
No guns.

1609
01:09:32,034 --> 01:09:33,763
Now, why don't you just take
the two of us

1610
01:09:33,802 --> 01:09:35,304
and let everyone else go.

1611
01:09:35,339 --> 01:09:36,498
Eat shit.

1612
01:09:36,539 --> 01:09:37,972
Mother!

1613
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:39,838
She never used language
like that at home.

1614
01:09:39,909 --> 01:09:40,876
Cuff those two.

1615
01:09:50,252 --> 01:09:51,981
Sorry, dear.

1616
01:09:54,056 --> 01:09:56,183
Are you done yet, dear?

1617
01:09:56,225 --> 01:09:57,590
Yes, yes, dear.

1618
01:09:57,626 --> 01:09:58,592
Thank you.

1619
01:09:58,627 --> 01:09:59,855
You are all prisoners of war

1620
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:02,921
in the second war
for American independence!

1621
01:10:02,965 --> 01:10:07,197
Our goaI is to liberate
our country

1622
01:10:07,236 --> 01:10:08,794
from the occupying
federaI army,

1623
01:10:08,837 --> 01:10:10,065
of which that man...

1624
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:13,034
is a high-ranking officer.

1625
01:10:13,075 --> 01:10:14,064
While in our custody,

1626
01:10:14,143 --> 01:10:15,542
you will be treated humanely

1627
01:10:15,578 --> 01:10:18,046
in accordance with the laws
of the Geneva Convention.

1628
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,069
In the meantime...

1629
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:20,274
we will submit

1630
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:23,841
a list of our demands
to your government.

1631
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:26,650
Now, do you see
what we had to do

1632
01:10:26,689 --> 01:10:28,156
to these two?

1633
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:30,920
That's because
they're troublemakers.

1634
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,985
Anybody else here
a troublemaker?

1635
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:34,120
Anybody else

1636
01:10:34,163 --> 01:10:35,755
need to be handcuffed?

1637
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:39,099
Okay, men!

1638
01:10:39,168 --> 01:10:40,658
Round 'em up!
Herd 'em in!

1639
01:10:40,703 --> 01:10:43,069
Just like the pigs
and heifers at home.

1640
01:10:43,105 --> 01:10:44,072
Let's go.

1641
01:10:44,106 --> 01:10:46,631
Does Danny always carry
a gun?

1642
01:10:46,675 --> 01:10:49,075
Catering business,
very competitive.

1643
01:10:49,111 --> 01:10:50,738
What about the guys
in the kitchen?

1644
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:51,768
Do you think-

1645
01:10:59,488 --> 01:11:01,046
Will you stop that?

1646
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:02,352
Stop it!

1647
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:03,949
Hands up, ladies,
let's go.

1648
01:11:05,027 --> 01:11:06,995
All right, move it!

1649
01:11:07,029 --> 01:11:08,291
Move it!

1650
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:09,524
Come on, Matt.
Come on..

1651
01:11:09,598 --> 01:11:11,259
I want you
to check out the video room.

1652
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:12,426
Check out the video room.

1653
01:11:12,501 --> 01:11:13,490
Make sure it's ready.

1654
01:11:13,535 --> 01:11:14,524
Now, just settle down.

1655
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:16,002
Settle down,
nice and easy.

1656
01:11:16,038 --> 01:11:17,869
Nice and easy.

1657
01:11:17,906 --> 01:11:19,567
That's good.

1658
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:33,281
What the hell kind
of party is this?

1659
01:11:33,322 --> 01:11:34,288
Oh!

1660
01:11:34,323 --> 01:11:37,121
Stephen, drag queens.

1661
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:41,926
Who are they?

1662
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:44,194
Bunch of big, ugly women.

1663
01:11:44,233 --> 01:11:45,461
They all just showed up.

1664
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:51,462
You owe us big-time, white boys.

1665
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:52,734
Come on, girls!
Come on.

1666
01:11:52,775 --> 01:11:55,300
Hey, hey,
what are you doing?

1667
01:11:55,344 --> 01:11:57,505
Take it easy, Martin.

1668
01:11:57,546 --> 01:12:00,208
Did you arrange
for there to be drag queens?

1669
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:03,952
Uh-uh.

1670
01:12:05,754 --> 01:12:07,585
Don't look at me.

1671
01:12:18,867 --> 01:12:21,062
Is the video ready?

1672
01:12:21,103 --> 01:12:22,070
Okay, then.

1673
01:12:22,104 --> 01:12:23,093
Upsy daisy,
Senator.

1674
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:24,196
Let's skedaddle.

1675
01:12:24,273 --> 01:12:25,797
Just follow me.
Keep an eye on him!

1676
01:12:25,874 --> 01:12:26,806
Great.

1677
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:28,172
They have the senator.

1678
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:29,199
Now what do we do?

1679
01:12:43,625 --> 01:12:47,493
God, this is worse
than a government party.

1680
01:12:48,731 --> 01:12:50,358
Would you watch
what you're doing?

1681
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:52,765
I'm walking as fast as I can
in these things.

1682
01:12:52,801 --> 01:12:53,790
I'm not used to cleats.

1683
01:12:56,605 --> 01:12:57,537
What is your name?

1684
01:12:57,606 --> 01:12:58,766
Richard, be quiet.

1685
01:12:58,807 --> 01:12:59,933
These guys
are serious.

1686
01:13:00,008 --> 01:13:01,339
Oh, they think they're all that,

1687
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:03,105
but they're all just cretins.

1688
01:13:03,145 --> 01:13:04,578
Do you hear me? Cretins!

1689
01:13:04,613 --> 01:13:05,892
Richard, you need-

1690
01:13:05,927 --> 01:13:07,172
I need?
I need?

1691
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:08,547
It's they
who need something.

1692
01:13:08,617 --> 01:13:10,380
It starts with "p"
and ends with "rozac. "

1693
01:13:10,419 --> 01:13:11,408
Shh!

1694
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:18,716
Oh.

1695
01:13:43,185 --> 01:13:44,277
Great party.

1696
01:13:44,353 --> 01:13:48,312
Richard, even if
our dinner hadn't-

1697
01:13:49,391 --> 01:13:51,586
why did you teach our men
to act...

1698
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:53,287
Queenie.
Queenie.

1699
01:13:53,362 --> 01:13:54,294
Queenie?

1700
01:13:54,363 --> 01:13:56,092
Queenie!

1701
01:13:56,165 --> 01:13:57,598
Gods!

1702
01:13:57,666 --> 01:14:00,191
The internalized homophobia
you two carry around with you

1703
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:01,998
is so toxic.

1704
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:03,867
It really isn't healthy.

1705
01:14:03,906 --> 01:14:05,669
I, at least,
have some pride in myself.

1706
01:14:05,707 --> 01:14:06,765
I have dignity.

1707
01:14:08,177 --> 01:14:09,838
It's the costume I wore
to the party.

1708
01:14:09,878 --> 01:14:12,005
I didn't change
because I rushed over here.

1709
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:15,413
I didn't want to miss
one fun-filled minute.

1710
01:14:16,785 --> 01:14:18,548
Look what I won at the raffle.

1711
01:14:18,587 --> 01:14:21,784
They're autographed
by all the Yankees.

1712
01:14:26,695 --> 01:14:28,458
Jealous.

1713
01:14:40,108 --> 01:14:41,598
12:30.

1714
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:44,043
When I think
of that poor dog all alone,

1715
01:14:44,112 --> 01:14:46,080
wondering what's
taking us so long,

1716
01:14:46,114 --> 01:14:48,878
he must be in agony.

1717
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:01,186
Damon?

1718
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:04,393
How long
have your parents been leaders

1719
01:15:04,433 --> 01:15:05,764
in the militia community?

1720
01:15:07,269 --> 01:15:10,932
Don Patrizzi, I don't know
what's wrong with them.

1721
01:15:10,973 --> 01:15:14,500
Whatever it is, it happened
after I moved away.

1722
01:15:14,543 --> 01:15:16,909
They used to be
the nicest, sweetest people.

1723
01:15:16,945 --> 01:15:19,436
I mean, when
the Sicilian Rescue League

1724
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:21,711
asked them to take me,
they said "yes" right away.

1725
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:24,653
The what Rescue League?

1726
01:15:24,688 --> 01:15:25,881
Sicilian.

1727
01:15:25,954 --> 01:15:27,615
You know, from Sicily.

1728
01:15:27,656 --> 01:15:30,090
My birth parents were killed
there in the big earthquake

1729
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:33,457
when I was two,
and the League brought me here.

1730
01:15:33,495 --> 01:15:35,554
And my parents adopted me.

1731
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:43,360
I wasn't supposed
to tell you that.

1732
01:15:43,405 --> 01:15:44,463
Jenny?

1733
01:15:44,506 --> 01:15:47,771
Remember that...

1734
01:15:47,809 --> 01:15:51,142
thing I wasn't supposed to talk
to your parents about?

1735
01:15:52,481 --> 01:15:55,416
So...

1736
01:15:55,484 --> 01:15:58,647
you're Sicilian.

1737
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:02,756
What do you think

1738
01:16:02,791 --> 01:16:04,656
about what Richard said?

1739
01:16:04,693 --> 01:16:07,321
You think we have
internalized homophobia?

1740
01:16:08,497 --> 01:16:09,828
I don't know.

1741
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:16,497
Sometimes I wonder if maybe
I need to do this kind of work,

1742
01:16:16,538 --> 01:16:22,408
something really tough,
you know, really manly

1743
01:16:22,444 --> 01:16:26,005
to almost make up for being gay.

1744
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:30,242
What about you?

1745
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:32,913
It was something we did
together.

1746
01:16:32,955 --> 01:16:36,686
I saw how much you liked it,

1747
01:16:36,725 --> 01:16:38,454
how happy you were.

1748
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:40,961
I'm so sorry, Danny.

1749
01:16:41,029 --> 01:16:42,860
Why, Stephen?

1750
01:16:42,931 --> 01:16:44,592
Why?

1751
01:16:44,633 --> 01:16:46,624
If not for me,
everything would be different.

1752
01:16:46,668 --> 01:16:49,262
Stephen, I'm happy.

1753
01:16:49,338 --> 01:16:50,965
I'm with you.

1754
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:53,837
Come on;
listen to me.

1755
01:16:53,875 --> 01:16:55,467
I'm happy.

1756
01:17:20,702 --> 01:17:21,691
Here he is!

1757
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:23,237
So the canary sang.

1758
01:17:23,271 --> 01:17:26,331
Here's your Benedict Arnold
of the federal occupying army.

1759
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:27,603
There you go.

1760
01:17:27,676 --> 01:17:28,870
Cover him, boys.

1761
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:30,002
Are you all right?
Yeah.

1762
01:17:30,078 --> 01:17:31,477
What'd they make you do
in there?

1763
01:17:31,513 --> 01:17:33,071
They made me read
this statement,

1764
01:17:33,115 --> 01:17:34,241
and they videotaped it.

1765
01:17:34,282 --> 01:17:35,977
They're going to send it
to the police.

1766
01:17:36,018 --> 01:17:38,509
Did I tell you
no talking?

1767
01:17:38,587 --> 01:17:41,887
Get up!

1768
01:17:41,923 --> 01:17:43,049
Get over there.

1769
01:17:43,091 --> 01:17:44,217
Just get over there!

1770
01:17:46,628 --> 01:17:49,756
You know, once the police
get that tape,

1771
01:17:49,798 --> 01:17:52,494
there'll be 500 cops
all over this place.

1772
01:17:52,534 --> 01:17:55,594
That's 500 fingers
on 500 triggers.

1773
01:17:55,637 --> 01:17:57,332
All we need
is one rookie to panic.

1774
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:03,501
Let's end this.

1775
01:18:03,545 --> 01:18:05,206
She looked right at me
and said,

1776
01:18:05,247 --> 01:18:07,215
"Just because
somebody's dead

1777
01:18:07,249 --> 01:18:08,978
doesn't mean
they've changed. "

1778
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,683
Mmm.

1779
01:18:13,722 --> 01:18:17,021
Richard, we need
your balls.

1780
01:18:17,059 --> 01:18:19,425
I've wanted this for years,
and now you ask me?

1781
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:21,292
Just give me
the baseballs.

1782
01:18:21,329 --> 01:18:22,455
I've only got one left.

1783
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:23,555
I gave the other one away.

1784
01:18:23,632 --> 01:18:24,564
Who'd you give it to?

1785
01:18:24,633 --> 01:18:25,861
Him.

1786
01:18:25,934 --> 01:18:27,367
The senator's aide.

1787
01:18:27,436 --> 01:18:28,494
Do you think he's cute?

1788
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:31,062
You're cruising
during a hostage situation?

1789
01:18:31,139 --> 01:18:32,436
What is the matter
with you?

1790
01:18:32,474 --> 01:18:33,771
The really hot one

1791
01:18:33,842 --> 01:18:34,831
is the one right there,

1792
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:36,241
baby.

1793
01:18:36,278 --> 01:18:37,438
Buns of steel.

1794
01:18:37,479 --> 01:18:38,571
Bruno.

1795
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:39,579
What?

1796
01:18:39,648 --> 01:18:41,047
We could all die tonight.

1797
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:42,277
If they want to kill me,

1798
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:45,877
they're going to have
to rape me first.

1799
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:50,488
Something big is going down.

1800
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:52,857
And someone better tell us
what it is.

1801
01:18:52,894 --> 01:18:54,293
Saffron, go find out.

1802
01:18:54,362 --> 01:18:56,956
I don't want to go over there
and get all disrespected.

1803
01:18:56,998 --> 01:18:58,659
What if he don't want
to tell me?

1804
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:01,567
No one's going
to disrespect you.

1805
01:19:01,603 --> 01:19:03,628
Now, take your ass
on over there.

1806
01:19:03,672 --> 01:19:06,505
You don't want to have
to make me go myself, do you?

1807
01:19:09,611 --> 01:19:11,272
Stephen, look-

1808
01:19:11,313 --> 01:19:13,474
No, no, no,
it's not a good time now.

1809
01:19:13,515 --> 01:19:15,005
Go away.

1810
01:19:22,524 --> 01:19:25,425
That Stephen guy
was very disrespectful.

1811
01:19:25,494 --> 01:19:28,327
He told me to go away
and leave him alone.

1812
01:19:28,396 --> 01:19:31,832
Miss Thing told you what?

1813
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:34,801
To go away
and leave him alone.

1814
01:19:40,509 --> 01:19:42,340
Okay, do we all know
what we're doing?

1815
01:19:44,312 --> 01:19:46,075
Okay,
let's do it.

1816
01:19:52,721 --> 01:19:54,382
Is this going to work?

1817
01:19:54,422 --> 01:19:55,889
Yeah, it's going to work,

1818
01:19:55,924 --> 01:19:57,915
because we are going
to grow old together.

1819
01:20:33,762 --> 01:20:35,320
Where're you going, sweetheart.

1820
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:49,575
You're done,
Mr. Jennings.

1821
01:20:55,884 --> 01:20:56,851
Danny!

1822
01:21:27,515 --> 01:21:28,447
Are you all right?

1823
01:21:30,118 --> 01:21:32,018
Dad.

1824
01:21:32,053 --> 01:21:33,042
Sir.

1825
01:21:33,121 --> 01:21:34,486
Stephen and I
want you to know

1826
01:21:34,522 --> 01:21:36,285
that we understand.

1827
01:21:36,324 --> 01:21:37,450
If you have a job to do-

1828
01:21:37,525 --> 01:21:38,753
Job? What job?

1829
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:41,752
I'm retired.

1830
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:43,889
Remember?
It's my birthday.

1831
01:21:43,932 --> 01:21:47,335
60, mandatory retirement
if you're undercover.

1832
01:21:47,370 --> 01:21:49,860
Retired?

1833
01:21:49,938 --> 01:21:51,805
What are you going to do?

1834
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,933
Actually, a carpet salesman
for real.

1835
01:21:53,975 --> 01:21:56,136
A carpet salesman?

1836
01:21:56,177 --> 01:21:58,145
I've had to learn a lot
about it for my cover.

1837
01:21:58,179 --> 01:21:59,407
Really quite interesting.

1838
01:21:59,447 --> 01:22:01,142
Here I am.

1839
01:22:01,182 --> 01:22:02,171
Oh, hi, sweetheart.

1840
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:05,651
Actually, I have
some ideas for your place.

1841
01:22:07,555 --> 01:22:08,954
All right, officer.
All right.

1842
01:22:08,990 --> 01:22:10,480
This has been
the worst day.

1843
01:22:10,558 --> 01:22:11,923
Worst day of my life.

1844
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:13,222
You!
You ruined my dinner!

1845
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:15,729
You ruined my revolution!

1846
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:17,425
Why did he say
the dinner was ruined?

1847
01:22:17,465 --> 01:22:19,262
I thought it was very good.

1848
01:22:19,301 --> 01:22:20,734
So did I.

1849
01:22:24,272 --> 01:22:26,263
To tell you the truth,
Mr. Grayson,

1850
01:22:26,308 --> 01:22:28,333
being gay was fun and all,
but after a while...

1851
01:22:28,376 --> 01:22:29,604
Yeah, I mean,
after a while,

1852
01:22:29,678 --> 01:22:33,170
I felt like I was
the purple teletubby.

1853
01:22:33,214 --> 01:22:34,943
Oh, please.

1854
01:22:34,983 --> 01:22:38,544
As if a gay man would ever have
a body like that.

1855
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:45,616
Was he just calling me fat?

1856
01:22:47,095 --> 01:22:48,892
Mom, Dad, all I ask is that
you not make any judgments

1857
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:52,127
till you get to know the people
we work for a little better.

1858
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:54,862
Well, that Stella that
I talked to seemed very nice.

1859
01:22:54,903 --> 01:22:56,962
So tell me, honestly,
what surprised you more?

1860
01:22:57,005 --> 01:22:58,438
Finding out
about me and Stephen

1861
01:22:58,506 --> 01:23:02,033
or finding out that your husband
works for the FBl?

1862
01:23:02,944 --> 01:23:05,037
Danny, I haven't-

1863
01:23:05,113 --> 01:23:06,478
Oh, God.

1864
01:23:06,514 --> 01:23:07,742
I'm so sorry.

1865
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:08,942
Well, I just thought that-

1866
01:23:09,017 --> 01:23:10,780
Jack.

1867
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:12,878
Stephen,
why didn't you stop me?

1868
01:23:12,921 --> 01:23:14,149
Did you really think

1869
01:23:14,222 --> 01:23:15,951
I didn't know?

1870
01:23:16,024 --> 01:23:17,116
How could I not know

1871
01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:19,422
with that great big Uzi
sitting in the cellar?

1872
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:24,864
Why would he say that
to me?

1873
01:23:24,933 --> 01:23:26,764
You think I'm fat?

1874
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:30,271
Girlfriend,
if the pumps fit.

1875
01:23:36,044 --> 01:23:37,033
Bitch.

1876
01:23:41,282 --> 01:23:42,977
Damon.

1877
01:23:43,051 --> 01:23:44,746
We've been speaking
with Don Patrizzi.

1878
01:23:44,786 --> 01:23:46,515
He's become
very interested in you

1879
01:23:46,554 --> 01:23:48,454
and your future role
in the family.

1880
01:23:49,758 --> 01:23:52,625
Future role
in the family?

1881
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:55,026
You're going to be spending
a lot more time

1882
01:23:55,063 --> 01:23:56,997
with Danny and me.

1883
01:23:57,065 --> 01:23:58,760
Gee, well, you know,
thanks, guys,

1884
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,098
but I don't want
to be a bother.

1885
01:24:01,169 --> 01:24:03,933
And, you know,
I already have a job.

1886
01:24:06,307 --> 01:24:08,172
God, honey,
you look exhausted.

1887
01:24:08,209 --> 01:24:10,803
Why don't you let
my parents take you home?

1888
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:11,868
I'm going to stay here

1889
01:24:11,913 --> 01:24:14,108
and finish things up
with the boys, okay?

1890
01:24:14,783 --> 01:24:16,774
Damon?

1891
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:19,516
Damon.

1892
01:24:20,588 --> 01:24:23,456
@ Hurry on down @

1893
01:24:23,491 --> 01:24:26,790
@ to my house, baby. @

1894
01:24:28,696 --> 01:24:32,223
@ Ain't nobody home but me. @

1895
01:24:36,004 --> 01:24:40,031
@ Hurry on down... @

1896
01:24:40,108 --> 01:24:41,735
What are you doing?

1897
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:43,505
Remember what Bruno said?

1898
01:24:46,414 --> 01:24:49,975
If something's perfect,
you have to create a flaw

1899
01:24:50,018 --> 01:24:52,077
so as not to offend
the gods.

1900
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:54,111
@ I love you. @

1901
01:24:55,857 --> 01:24:58,121
@ And you love me. @

1902
01:24:58,159 --> 01:25:01,287
So as not to offend
the gods.

1903
01:25:01,329 --> 01:25:02,819
@ Hurry through the alley. @

1904
01:25:02,864 --> 01:25:04,456
Stephen? Danny!

1905
01:25:04,532 --> 01:25:05,499
Good night!

1906
01:25:07,569 --> 01:25:09,002
Good night, Mom.
Night, Dad.

1907
01:25:09,037 --> 01:25:10,003
Love you.

1908
01:25:10,038 --> 01:25:11,403
Wait a minute;
the drag queens.

1909
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:13,134
We didn't see any of them
do their acts.

1910
01:25:13,174 --> 01:25:15,267
Stephen!
Stephen!

1911
01:25:15,343 --> 01:25:16,742
@ Something's got @

1912
01:25:16,778 --> 01:25:18,439
@ a hold on me, yeah. @

1913
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,675
@ Oh, it must be love. @

1914
01:25:20,748 --> 01:25:22,340
@ Oh, something's got a hold @

1915
01:25:22,383 --> 01:25:25,352
@ on me right now, child. @

1916
01:25:25,386 --> 01:25:27,149
@ Oh, it must be love. @

1917
01:25:27,188 --> 01:25:28,553
@ Let me tell you, now, @

1918
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:29,557
@ I've got a feeling. @

1919
01:25:29,591 --> 01:25:32,116
@ I feel so strange. @

1920
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:35,163
@ Everything about me
seems to have changed. @

1921
01:25:35,198 --> 01:25:38,155
@ Step by step,
I got a brand-new walk. @

1922
01:25:38,199 --> 01:25:40,793
@ I even sound sweeter
when I talk. @

1923
01:25:40,869 --> 01:25:41,801
@ I said, oh. @

1924
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:42,802
@ Oh. @

1925
01:25:42,871 --> 01:25:43,803

@ Oh. @

@ Oh. @

1928
01:25:45,874 --> 01:25:46,806
@ Oh. @

1929
01:25:46,875 --> 01:25:47,807
@ Oh! @

1930
01:25:47,876 --> 01:25:48,808
@ Oh. @

1931
01:25:48,877 --> 01:25:50,003
@ Hey, hey, yeah. @

1962
01:26:45,066 --> 01:26:48,695
@ I never thought

1963
01:26:48,736 --> 01:26:51,604
@ Got me happy
