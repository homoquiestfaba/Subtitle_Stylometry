336
00:18:02,329 --> 00:18:03,873

<b>"FOLKS, EVERYBODY'S GOT TO</b>

<b>I REMEMBER IT</b>
<b>LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY.</b>

340
00:18:10,387 --> 00:18:13,351
<b>HE SAID, "YOU MIGHT BE</b>
<b>WITNESSING THE BIRTH OF A STAR,</b>

00:18:34,977 --> 00:18:37,816
<b>"I BEGGED YOU NOT TO COME."</b>

00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:40,905
<b>OH, I BEGGED THEM NOT TO COME.</b>

348
00:18:41,574 --> 00:18:43,786
<b>I SAID, "THE ONLY WAY I CAN</b>
<b>HANDLE THIS IS TO CONFRONT IT." </b>

349
00:18:43,786 --> 00:18:45,165
<b>SO I WENT TO MY</b>

350
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:49,256

625
00:32:13,404 --> 00:32:15,241
<i><b> CHAPPELLE'S SHOW</b></i>
<b>WAS A RARE THING.</b>

626
00:32:15,241 --> 00:32:18,498
<b>IT WAS A FULLY FACETED DOCUMENT</b>
<b>OF A HUMAN BEING LIVING IN THE</b>

<b>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,</b>

630
00:32:24,384 --> 00:32:27,182
<b>SO YOU KNOW,</b>
<i><b> PLAYBOY AFTER DARK.</b></i>

631
00:32:28,977 --> 00:32:31,357
<b>ALSO, THE SHOW WAS PERSONAL. </b>

632
00:32:31,357 --> 00:32:33,027

<b>QUIT THE SHOW BECAUSE HE</b>

<b>HE SAID "THIS IS</b>

642
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:04,840
<b>ALRIGHT, AS YOU CAN SEE HE</b>

<b>"I'M FUCKING 44, BEEN DOING</b>

<b>THIS MOTHERFUCKER WAS BORN,</b>

654
00:33:37,405 --> 00:33:40,870
<b>CAME OUT, "WAAH,</b>

<b>BUT ONE CHARACTER IN PARTICULAR,</b>
<b>"ASHY LARRY" A LOT OF PEOPLE</b>

<b>IN FACT, HUMOR WAS</b>

671
00:34:33,851 --> 00:34:37,317
<b>THE ONLY REASON I NEVER GOT MY</b>

673
00:34:39,529 --> 00:34:42,452

<b>YOU REMEMBER WHAT</b>
<b>IT DID TO THIS CITY.</b>

<b>PUSHING STROLLERS AND THINGS,</b>
<b>CAUSE ALL THESE NIGGA'S IN D.C.</b>

<b>I MET DAVE IN, IN THE 90S,</b>
<b>THE EARLY 90S,</b>

779
00:40:28,936 --> 00:40:32,401
<b>HE WAS A 17 YEAR OLD KID,</b>
<b>COMING TO NEW YORK CITY,</b>

780
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,365
<b>JUST OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL,</b>

781
00:40:35,365 --> 00:40:37,620
<b>CUTTING HIS TEETH ON WHAT</b>
<b>WERE SOME OF THE TOUGHEST</b>

782
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:40,375
<b>COMEDY ROOMS IN THE COUNTRY,</b>

783
00:40:40,626 --> 00:40:45,970
<b>AND HE WAS SHOCKINGLY</b>
<b>FORMED AT 17 YEARS OLD.</b>

784
00:40:46,763 --> 00:40:50,228
<b>AND YOU WOULD, OLD GRIZZLED</b>
<b>COMEDY VETERANS FROM THERE,</b>

785
00:40:50,604 --> 00:40:54,571
<b>YOU WOULD THINK WE</b>
<b>WOULD HAVE NOTHING BUT ANGER</b>

786
00:40:54,571 --> 00:40:58,495
<b>AT THIS YOUNG PRODIGY,</b>
<b>THIS YOUNG MOZART.</b>

787
00:41:00,206 --> 00:41:04,507
<b>AND YET, YOU LOVED HIM</b>
<b>BECAUSE OF THE KINDNESS</b>

788
00:41:04,507 --> 00:41:06,845
<b>OF HIS SPIRIT, AND...</b>

789
00:41:06,845 --> 00:41:08,181
<b>EVEN BACK THEN,</b>

790
00:41:08,181 --> 00:41:12,189
<b>I KNEW HOW HILARIOUS HE</b>
<b>WAS AND HOW INSIGHTFUL HE WAS.</b>

791
00:41:12,482 --> 00:41:15,153
<b>I REMEMBER, WE</b>
<b>WORKED TOGETHER IN THE 2000'S,</b>

792
00:41:15,153 --> 00:41:17,157
<b>WE WERE BOTH AT COMEDY CENTRAL.</b>
<b>I WAS AT </b><i><b>THE DAILY SHOW,</b></i>

793
00:41:17,157 --> 00:41:19,453
<b>DAVE WAS AT</b>
<i><b> CHAPPELLE'S SHOW</b></i><b> AND,</b>

794
00:41:19,996 --> 00:41:24,463
<i><b> CHAPPELLE'S SHOW</b></i><b> WAS THIS</b>
<b>ROCKET SHIP THAT HE HAD CREATED.</b>

795
00:41:24,463 --> 00:41:27,762
<b>AND IT BECAME THIS</b>
<b>CULTURAL PHENOMENON,</b>

796
00:41:29,473 --> 00:41:32,522
<b>AND COMEDY CENTRAL WOULD DO</b>
<b>ANYTHING TO KEEP IT GOING.</b>

797
00:41:32,939 --> 00:41:36,697
<b>AND THEY OFFERED DAVE $50</b>
<b>MILLION TO JUST GIVE THEM,</b>

798
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:39,118
<b>JUST GIVE THEM ONE MORE,</b>
<b>JUST GIVE US ONE MORE.</b>

799
00:41:39,118 --> 00:41:42,082
<b>BUT DAVE AT THAT</b>
<b>MOMENT WAS CONFLICTED</b>

800
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:45,171
<b>BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTY</b>
<b>OF HOW THE SHOW WAS TO DO,</b>

801
00:41:45,548 --> 00:41:50,098
<b>BECAUSE HE WONDERED ABOUT</b>
<b>ITS IMPACT ON THE AUDIENCE THAT</b>

802
00:41:50,098 --> 00:41:53,479
<b>HE MEANT IT FOR,</b>
<b>AND HE WALKED AWAY.</b>

803
00:41:54,774 --> 00:41:58,949
<b>AND IT WAS THAT MOMENT</b>
<b>THAT I REMEMBER THINKING...</b>

804

<b>"COMEDY CENTRAL</b>
<b>HAS $50 MILLION?"</b>

<b>WELL AT THAT POINT DAVE</b>
<b>HE LEFT, HE WAS DONE.</b>

810
00:42:39,405 --> 00:42:43,121
<b>BUT I KNEW, THAT MONEY</b>
<b>WAS GOING TO NEED A HOME.</b>

<b>INTERACTS WITH PEOPLE;</b>
<b>RANDOM PEOPLE, RANDOM FANS.</b>

817
00:43:11,093 --> 00:43:13,306

<b>AND THEY SAY IN AFRICA,</b>
<b>WHEN A GRIOT DIES,</b>

1544
01:21:10,230 --> 01:21:13,403
<b>IT'S LIKE A</b>
<b>LIBRARY WAS BURNT DOWN.</b>

1545
01:21:13,862 --> 01:21:15,992
<b>AND MY MOTHER USED TO TELL ME,</b>
<b>BEFORE I EVER THOUGHT ABOUT</b>

1546
01:21:15,992 --> 01:21:19,082
<b>DOING COMEDY, SHE TOLD ME</b>
<b>"YOU SHOULD BE A GRIOT"</b>

1547
01:21:19,082 --> 01:21:21,836
<b>AND SHE'D FILL ME WITH</b>
<b>EVERY STORY OF BLACK LIFE.</b>

1548
01:21:21,836 --> 01:21:24,592
<b>YOU KNOW, SHE'S EDUCATED</b>
<b>IN AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES,</b>

1549
01:21:24,592 --> 01:21:26,763
<b>AND SHE WOULD LET ME</b>
<b>UNDERSTAND THE CONTEXT THAT </b>

1550
01:21:26,763 --> 01:21:28,058
<b>I WAS BEING RAISED IN.</b>

1551
01:21:28,058 --> 01:21:31,147
<b>THAT I'M BEING RAISED IN A</b>
<b>HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT THAT</b>

1552
01:21:31,147 --> 01:21:32,566
<b>I HAVE TO TAME.</b>

1553
01:21:32,566 --> 01:21:35,614
<b>BY THE TIME I WAS 14 YEARS</b>
<b>OLD I WAS IN NIGHTCLUBS,</b>

1554
01:21:35,614 --> 01:21:37,701
<b>MASTERING AN ADULT WORLD.</b>

1555
01:21:38,078 --> 01:21:39,622
<b>IT WAS TERRIFYING.</b>

1556
01:21:39,622 --> 01:21:41,709
<b>CRACK EPIDEMIC WAS GOING ON,</b>
<b>AND MY MOTHER WOULD HEAR</b>

1557
01:21:41,709 --> 01:21:43,880
<b>GUNSHOTS OUTSIDE AND</b>
<b>BE SCARED TO DEATH,</b>

1558
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:45,426
<b>MAYBE IT'S MY SON.</b>

1559
01:21:45,426 --> 01:21:47,721
<b>BUT EARLY IN MY CAREER,</b>
<b>IF YOU REMEMBER MOM,</b>

1560
01:21:48,056 --> 01:21:50,310
<b>YOU USED TO SIT IN</b>
<b>THE CLUB WITH ME.</b>

1561
01:21:50,310 --> 01:21:52,773
<b>SHE'D DO A FULL DAY OF WORK,</b>
<b>YOU'D BE BACK THERE,</b>

1562
01:21:52,773 --> 01:21:54,569
<b>FALLING ASLEEP, JUST</b>
<b>WAITING FOR ME TO GO ON.</b>

1563
01:21:54,987 --> 01:21:57,241
<b>SHE WOULD WATCH MY</b>
<b>SHOW EVERY NIGHT,</b>

1564
01:21:57,241 --> 01:22:00,205
<b>DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG</b>
<b>THAT CAR RIDE IS HOME?</b>

1565
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:03,253
<b>.</b>

1566
01:22:05,090 --> 01:22:07,553
<b>HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE</b>
<b>EVER HEARD YOUR MOTHER SAY,</b>

1567
01:22:07,553 --> 01:22:10,476
<b>"PUSSY JOKES WERE A</b>
<b>LITTLE TOO MUCH TONIGHT, SON"?</b>

1568
01:22:11,269 --> 01:22:13,565
<b>.</b>

1569
01:22:16,237 --> 01:22:18,617
<b>I WAS A SOFT KID.</b>

1570
01:22:18,617 --> 01:22:20,788
<b>I WAS SENSITIVE, I CRIED EASY,</b>

1571
01:22:20,788 --> 01:22:22,750
<b>AND I WOULD BE</b>
<b>SCARED TO FISTFIGHT.</b>

1572
01:22:22,750 --> 01:22:24,629
<b>AND MY MOTHER USED TO</b>
<b>TELL ME THIS THING,</b>

1573
01:22:24,629 --> 01:22:25,881
<b>I DON'T EVEN KNOW</b>
<b>IF YOU REMEMBER,</b>

1574
01:22:25,881 --> 01:22:27,468
<b>BUT YOU SAID THIS TO</b>
<b>ME MORE THAN ONCE.</b>

1575
01:22:27,468 --> 01:22:31,476
<b>YOU SAID, "SON, SOMETIMES YOU</b>
<b>HAVE TO BE A LION SO YOU CAN</b>

1576
01:22:31,476 --> 01:22:33,688
<b>BE THE LAMB YOU REALLY ARE".</b>

1577
01:22:35,234 --> 01:22:38,323
<b>I TALK THIS SHIT LIKE A LION,</b>

1578
01:22:38,323 --> 01:22:41,329
<b>I'M NOT AFRAID OF ANY OF YOU</b>
<b>WHEN IT COMES WORD TO WORD,</b>

1579
01:22:41,663 --> 01:22:44,836
<b>I WILL GAB WITH</b>
<b>THE BEST OF THEM.</b>

1580
01:22:44,836 --> 01:22:47,675
<b>JUST SO I CAN CHILL AND BE ME.</b>

1581
01:22:47,675 --> 01:22:49,470
<b>AND THAT'S WHY I</b>
<b>LOVE MY ART FORM,</b>

1582
01:22:49,470 --> 01:22:51,391
<b>BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND</b>
<b>EVERY PRACTITIONER OF IT.</b>

1583
01:22:51,391 --> 01:22:52,852
<b>WHETHER I AGREE</b>
<b>WITH THEM OR NOT,</b>

1584
01:22:52,852 --> 01:22:54,147
<b>I KNOW WHERE</b>
<b>THEY'RE COMING FROM.</b>

1585
01:22:54,147 --> 01:22:56,025
<b>THEY WANNA BE HEARD,</b>
<b>THEY GOT SOMETHING TO SAY,</b>

1586
01:22:56,025 --> 01:22:59,949
<b>THERE'S SOMETHING THEY NOTICE,</b>
<b>THEY JUST WANNA BE UNDERSTOOD.</b>

<b>SPECIAL WAY THAT I</b>
<b>CANNOT DO ON MY OWN.</b>
