Mission control come in.

00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,430
Mission control, do you read?

3
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,360
Mayday...

4
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:29,800
Mayday!

5
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,670
I'm re-entering Earth's orbit, I seem to have fallen into...

6
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:37,010
I don't know, some kind of tear in time and space.

7
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,600
My coordinates are unknown.

8
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:40,610
And is either...

9
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,270
Seems entrance indicate it should be White Sands, New Mexico.

10
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,740
Obvious error.

11
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,410
Is anyone receiving this?

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,140
Recovery team!

13
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,810
Recovery team, fix coordinates now!

14
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,800
Where the hell am I?

15
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,480
Somebody respond!

16
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,620
Recovery team come back, god damn it.

17
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,950
Oh god, oh god.

18
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,680
Anyone re-!

00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,170
This is TODAY with Matt Lauer.

21
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:33,240
We're back now with Dr. Rick Marshall whose new book arrives in stores tomorrow.

22
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,870
It was back in Oslo, Doctor, last month that you just startled your colleagues,

23
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,350
with this theory of yours that takes science in a completely new direction.

24
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,290
Quantum Paleontology.

25
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,700
Quantum Paleontology, that's correct.

26
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,870
What exactly is that?

27
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:50,180
Well it's a...not to say very modestly...it's our very future Matt.

28
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,900
It's the only real solution to solving this fossil fuel crisis we're experiencing

29
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,220
and it boils down to two simple words.

30
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,930
Renewable bio-fuels?

31
00:01:58,930 --> 00:01:59,530
Close.

32
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,910
Time Warps.

33
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,320
Time Warps? You're serious about this?

34
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,220
I'm deadly serious.

35
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,110
Five years, over fifty million dollars on my research...

36
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,980
You spent fifty million dollars of your own money, studying Time Warps?

37
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,020
No, that's adorable.

38
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,270
No, tax payers' money. I don't have fifty million dollars.

39
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,770
And now you're asking for more?

40
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,480
It's all explained, in my book.

41
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,500
I know we plugged the book.

42
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,970
My Other Car is a Time Machine.

43
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,710
Bantum books, Amazon...

44
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,600
We're living in a time right now, with huge cuts in spend-

45
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,890
I saw, huge cuts in spending.
-Right

46
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,560
We're in dire economic straights,

47
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,140
and you're spending fifty million dollars on studying Time Warps?

48
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,210
How do you not think that's irresponsible?

49
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,240
Are you smoking?

50
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,930
No I'm making a balloon animal here.

51
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,280
You can't smoke in the studio.

52
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,360
No one told me that.

53
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,010
Listen, you can't.

54
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:44,880
Fine.

55
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:50,010
There are huge huge amounts of trans-dimensional energy out there

56
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,210
just waiting for us to throw the switch, energy crisis averted.

57
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:57,710
You are asking people to stake the entire future of industrialized civilization,

58
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,240
on what you call Parallel Dimensions?

59
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:03,870
What about the critics who have a fair question doctor, they say...

60
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,280
This theory of yours is not science, it is non-science,

61
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,860
and some even more bluntly say it's nonsense.

62
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,040
How do you respond to that?

63
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,690
My critics?

64
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,130
Your critics, there are a lot of them.

65
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:13,990
Could you be more specific?

66
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,030
Steven Hawking.

67
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,930
Steven Hawking says this is nonsense, that's his word.

68
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,140
You know what this interview's over.

69
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:21,770
Why?

70
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,650
Your producer said you wouldn't bring that up.

71
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:25,630
It's a fair question.

72
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,020
No it's not, it's a hatchet job!

73
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,500
That was my guest Dr. Rick Marshall his book arrives in stores tomorrow,

74
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,780
God damn right it was!
That was my guest Dr. Rick Marshall his book arrives in stores tomorrow,

75
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,780
That was my guest Dr. Rick Marshall his book arrives in stores tomorrow,

76
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:35,640
you might want to look for it in the I'm out of my freakin' mind department.

77
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,600
When we come back, trampolines. Summer fun or silent killer?

78
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,010
Ladies and gentlemen.

79
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,430
Esteemed colleagues.

80
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,040
I'll conclude with this.

81
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:57,160
Our very future depends on one thing.

82
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,610
Tachyons.

83
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:03,520
Sub-atomic particles that move so incredibly fast they actually travel backwards in time.

84
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,240
Ask yourself, what if there was a device that could harness these tachyons.

85
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:12,680
We could open and travel through warps in time and space.

86
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:13,850
What's that?

87
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:15,890
Not in our lifetime?

88
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,310
My friends, I've designed such a device.

89
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,340
I give to you the Tachyon Amplifier.

90
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,690
Genius in a box.

91
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,870
Only with this device, you don't travel forwards or backwards.

92
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,920
You travel sideways in time.

93
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:35,490
To another dimension where past, present, and future all meet.

94
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:37,880
And, lights.

95
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:40,060
Alright...

96
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,730
Any questions?

97
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,820
Oh, great. Yes, you right there young man.

98
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,340
Yeah, if you shot a ton of pot at the sun,
would it burn up and get everybody high?

99
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,460
No, no...

100
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,700
Are there any real questions that pertain to science?

101
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,000
Do you take Cialis?

102
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,000
Why were you crying in the bathroom before this presentation?

103
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,850
How come it looks like you're about to cry now?

104
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,560
Do Dinosaurs have boobs?

105
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,280
That's it. That's it, everybody out of here.

106
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,040
Get out of here.

107
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,550
Go play in the parking lot.
Go run around on the Fr eway, I don't care.

108
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,370
I have a question.

109
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,230
Did you ever try to make the Tachyon Amplifier?

110
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,260
Who're you?

111
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,360
Oh, I'm sorry.

112
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,360
I'm Holly Cantrell, I studied all your work at Cambridge.

113
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:19,900
I think you're brilliant.

114
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,520
Well, Holly from Cambridge who thinks I'm brilliant.

115
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,410
I started, but I didn't finish so no.

116
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,680
No but you have to build it, it's the most incredible-

117
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,060
What are you eating?

118
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,150
It's a dough nut stuffed with M&M's.

119
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,590
That way when you finish the dough nut, you don't have to eat any M&M's.

120
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,980
But don't you see you are absolutely right, everything-

121
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,520
Stop.

122
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:45,090
Chasing that theory got me laughed out of main stream science and landed me here.

123
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,110
But you know what, I don't got anyone to blame but myself.

124
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,660
Because as they say...

125
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,150
If you don't make it, it's your own damn "vault."

126
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,180
That's a bitch slap of truth right there.

127
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,480
If your theories are such rubbish.

128
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,610
Then explain this.

129
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:09,740
That fossil is over 265 million years old
with an imprint of a $10 lighter.

130
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,910
Go on and explain that.

131
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,590
I found that out in the desert along with crystals like this that radiate pure tachyon energy.

132
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:18,930
Go on.

133
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:21,830
Explain that.

134
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,450
Captain Kirk's nipples...!

135
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:03,690
The tar pits will be opened in 5 minutes, Dr. Marshall please return the page.

136
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:06,620
Dr. Marshall?

137
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,290
Oh god.

138
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:13,750
Are you alright?

139
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:14,630
Hey!

140
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:15,970
Up you go.

141
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,450
Dear...

142
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,520
I'm fine.

143
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:23,590
I'm okay.

144
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,350
I just worked late.

145
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,310
Then I got hungry.

146
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,400
Ate several meals and lapsed into a food coma.

147
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,200
I've had issues with food in the past.

148
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,060
I don't know, you know just with the stress of everything I just overdid it.

149
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,290
But I'm in control.

150
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,670
Now I don't have to go back to Phoenix.

151
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:46,830
I just wanted to come by, and apologize for yesterday,

152
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,390
my behavior was just...

153
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,360
No, no, no...

154
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,810
You finished the Tachyon Amplifier!

155
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,230
No, no...I mean yes.

156
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,010
I-I don't know...

157
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,020
I finished building it yes, but...

158
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,520
I didn't have the nerve to test it out.

159
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,920
So I thought a trip to Arby's might give me some courage, no dice.

160
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,660
But I hit Popeyes, Del Taco...

161
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,230
Fourteen thousand calories later.

162
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,030
I found myself down at Subway.

163
00:08:13,720 --> 00 08:16,340
Powering through a 12 inch veggie on whole wheat.

164
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,080
Battling to come out a "Jared."

165
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,910
Still didn't give me the strength to turn that thing on.

166
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:23,970
I'm a coward.

167
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,920
You are not a coward, you're a visionary.

168
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,160
This is probably the greatest work of genius in the last hundred years.

169
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,890
Is that a chorus line?

170
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,920
It's left over data from the drive.

171
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:45,180
What a piece of crap!

172
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,880
The machine I mean

173
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:49,680
Not a chorus line.

174
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,190
I love show tunes, they really tell the story of the human condition.

175
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,530
It's a bit gay.

176
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,650
It is great.

177
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,210
Right.

178
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,950
Dr. Marshall you're going to stop selling yourself short,

179
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,270
you're on the verge of a major discovery, now get up!

180
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,320
Whoa, where are we going?

181
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,680
We're going to test this little device, in the field.

182
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,900
Are you crazy? I'm not prepared for a field test!

183
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:12,300
No, I'm not going to make a big deal out of it just a routine expedition.

184
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,060
A routine expedition?

185
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,290
Purely routine.

186
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,020
Here, here it is. This is where I found the fossil.

187
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,950
The Devil's Canyon mystery cave.

188
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,400
This dump is a portal?

189
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,170
Would you look at these readings?

190
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,200
We just gotta get back in that cave.

191
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,240
No problem, the place is obviously abandoned.

192
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,920
Not exactly.

193
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,770
What's your pleasure?

194
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:48,000
I got Roman Candles, Bottle Rockets, Twitter Glitters, Dancing Butterflies?

195
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,850
This little bitch right here I call the Mexican Vasectomy.

196
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:51,690
Yeah?

197
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,350
Okay, that's some bad taste.

198
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,340
How 'bout this?

199
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,700
This is a little travel mug I like to call, the perfect woman.

200
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,730
Big ol' set of boobies, no head and a handle.

201
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,500
Look we want to go in the cave, alright?

202
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:06,830
Okay, how about this.

203
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,830
Ya'll spend $30 on crap, I'll give you a deluxe tour.

204
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,260
It all goes to a great cause.

205
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:15,210
The Devil's Canyon Resort & Casino!

206
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,040
Wow, that's nice craft.

207
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,180
Seven thousand luxuriously appointed rooms

208
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,380
Three casinos.

209
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,810
One convention center.

210
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,170
Ass-tons of parking.

211
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,670
And when everything is complete,

212
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:33,150
I will turn the tip of this golden tee-pee into my personal lair.

213
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:36,670
And I will take a mate, and live the rest of my life with her up here.

214
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:40,240
When we fight, and she pisses me off, I will banish her to this tip,

215
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,660
where she will be kept as a prisoner and a slave.

216
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:44,920
So you gonna buy anything?

217
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,180
Yeah, fine.

218
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,700
Hey Earn, taking these guys to the cave. Watch the store.

219
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,140
Close your mouth while you're breathing like we talked about.

220
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,640
Making everybody over here feel wierd.

221
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:10,170
Prepare to meet your darkest fears inside the depths of the Devil's Canyon mystery cave!

222
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,030
Rule number one, keep your arms and legs inside the boat.

223
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,830
Rule number two, have a kick ass awesome time!

224
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,700
But be warned...

225
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,780
You may get wet.

226
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,640
I'm sorry, may?

227
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,960
Actually, I need to know this equipment cannot get wet.

228
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,920
Not you, Mary Poppins

229
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,570
Bam-chica-wow-wow...

230
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,070
Say that again, and I'll drown you.

231
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,600
Good to go!

232
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,310
Woo, cave ride begins!

233
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:40,700
Woo!

234
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:53,010
They all just say this old cave is a hundred years old and holds a thousand mysteries.

235
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,610
Or is it thousand years old, and a hundred mysteries.

236
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,440
Well that my friends, is just one of the mysteries.

237
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:04,380
Say what you will my man, as a showman.

238
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,470
Without a doubt.

239
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,340
This cave is most infamous for the legend of the Devil's Canyon lizard man.

240
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,850
He's been seen around these parts since the pilgrim times.

241
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,720
Snapping his claws, hissin, tryin' to eat people up.

242
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:25,400
Lurking about in the dark dark shadows of this very cave.

243
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,530
But those are just legends, aren't they?

244
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:36,710
Aren't they?!

245
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,630
Are you asking us?

246
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:40,540
No, no.

247
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:41,990
Earnie! Aren't they?

248
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,950
Here it comes, Will!

249
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:45,990
Oh god!

250
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,640
The lizard man!

251
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,830
You're paying for that.

252
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,310
I most definitely am not.

253
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:56,130
You know I'm sitting here trying to give you guys a really awesome adventure,

254
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:58,080
and you guys are giving me nothing in return!

255
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,650
I got the gloves on, the hat, the pageantry!

256
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,980
Holly, I'm getting a strong Tachyon reading!

257
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:07,040
I think I can boost the hell out of this signal with a resonant wave!

258
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,950
Go for it!

259
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,400
You guys don't even care.

260
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,350
No no, there are no showtunes on this ride!

261
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:22,780
Something's happening!

262
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,600
Is this part of the ride?!

263
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,550
Nah, this ain't me!

264
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,910
It's an earthquake!

265
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,000
Greatest earthquake ever known!

266
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,730
Marshall, I think you should turn it up!

267
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,620
The meter!

268
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,580
We're moving!

269
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,250
This isn't me, this isn't me!

270
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,620
Why are we moving so fast?!

271
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,880
Do I look like I know what's going on?!

 72
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:53,840
What's that sound?!

273
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,100
Is there a waterfall in here?!

274
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,000
Hell no dude, this isn't even a real stream!

275
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,030
It's industrial run off of the soap factory down the street!

276
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:07,280
What is that?!

277
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,910
Oh shit!

278
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,550
This is not a routine expedition!

279
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,630
Reverse!

280
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,720
It's beautiful!

281
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,830
I gotta say I did not see that coming.

282
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,160
Earnie! You bastard!

283
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,790
That was way too fast.

284
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,320
Earnie!

285
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,050
Too fast!

286
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,320
Marshall!

287
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:26,050
I think you should come and look at this!

288
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,680
Do you realize what this means?!

289
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,320
Yes!

290
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:35,700
It means...

291
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,910
Matt Lauer can suck it!

292
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,680
Holly, are you rolling?
-Yes!

293
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,220
That was a viking ship and a-

294
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,210
Shut up just shut up!

295
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:48,790
Okay, currently in our party...

296
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,610
Me, Dr. Rick Marshall.

297
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:56,080
Doctoral candidate Holly Cantrell and some trashy
tailer park reject who smells of malt liquor and feet.

298
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,960
I'm standin' right here!

299
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,870
I was right!

300
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,870
Holly, right here!

301
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,410
Just as I predicted we have been...

302
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:06,040
We've fallen through a time portal from our Earth,
to another dimension where past, present and future,

303
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,580
are all mashed up together!

304
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:08,730
How the hell did this happen?

305
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,780
My Tachyon Amplifier, that's how it happened!

306
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,420
You mean that shitty boombox pumpin' showtunes?
-Yes, it worked!

307
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,480
Where the hell is it?

308
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,720
Okay, minor set back.

309
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:22,190
My tachyon amplifier, which undoubtedly will be the only possible way for us to open a doorway home.

310
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,680
Is nowhere to be seen.

311
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,400
What the hell was that?

312
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,120
I have no idea but let's go find out!

313
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,300
Primates!

314
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,800
I heard they had the posture of an Australopithecy but it's actually quite-

315
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,690
No, no, no...shut up!

316
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:49,510
I will not let you ruin this moment, I waited my entire life to see the mighty big foot!

317
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,880
Man, are you touching yourself?

318
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,850
Marshall, look!

319
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,730
Oh my god!

320
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:57,910
Tool construction!

321
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,610
Tool construction!

322
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,800
Yea! They're gonna kill him!

323
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,280
No!

324
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,780
Okay you egg heads you follow my lead.

325
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,950
I know just how to party with these guys.

326
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,420
You little monkey bastards!

327
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:18,940
Prepare to bow down and worship me!

328
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,600
For behold, ye' Troglodytes...

329
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:25,230
I command the power of. .fire!

330
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,380
Will, that's not a good idea.

331
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:28,990
How do you like me now huh?

332
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:30,930
You want to disco dance you-

333
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,390
Ouch! Son of a bitch...!

334
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,000
Well done.

335
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:41,140
You've just now given murderous primitives the power of fire.

336
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,790
It's alright.

337
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,530
It's alright don't be frightened.

338
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:03,240
We're friends.

339
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:08,300
Friends.

340
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,170
Careful Holly.

341
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,430
Come on.

342
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,670
Come on!

343
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,910
Come on.

344
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:16,670
There we go.

345
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,950
I spent 3 years at the Manchester Primate House.

346
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,510
I'm recognizing their very primitive language.

347
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:24,910
Now..

348
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:29,270
Me? Holly.

349
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,280
Yes, Holly!

350
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,440
Holly.

351
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,780
Me? Holly...

352
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,040
You?

353
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:46,870
Cha-ka?

354
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:47,920
Cha-ka!

355
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,700
No, Holly...Cha-ka!

356
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,280
Wi-ill...

357
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:55,520
Will...

358
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,490
Good work Holly.

359
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:00,700
Let me take over from here.

360
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,210
Greeting Cha-ka!

361
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,540
Cha-ka?

362
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,870
I'm Dr. Rick Marshall.

363
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,220
Doctor Rick...Marshall?

364
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:12,530
Okay?

365
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,650
Let's take a look at that ankle.

366
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,270
Does that sound good?

367
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:21,810
Keep in mind Cha-ka, although I'm a doctor, I'm not a licensed physician.

368
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,930
Okay? Just going to take a little look-

369
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,380
How dare you! How dare you!

370
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,250
I mean you no harm!

371
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:29,890
Marshall, Marshall!

372
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,030
Don't you run from me you little shit!

373
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:34,630
Now you're dead!

374
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,490
Damn it Chaka!

375
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,390
Now was that necessary?

376
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,500
Marshall! Marshall, wait stay where you are.

377
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,320
What was that?

378
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,040
Look he was never in any danger, okay?

379
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,320
Cha-ka! Friend!

380
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:56,960
Safety! Safety!

381
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:58,330
Safety!

382
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,820
Holly, tell him.

383
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,540
Marshall?

384
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,720
Marshall...

385
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,800
Haboo! Haboo!

386
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,730
Haboo?

387
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:10,580
Haboo.

388
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,800
Well that's more like it.

389
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,170
Holly what did you tell him?

390
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:22,930
I think I told him that you're a great chief, and you're very powerful.

391
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:25,640
And I think he's pledging his life long loyalty to you.

392
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,730
That's hardly necessary my little friend.

393
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,880
But I will honor your customs.

394
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,860
And you may serve me.

395
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:38,530
In return I will be a fair but very strict master.

396 
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:42,580
What?!

397
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,690
What is wrong with you people?!

398
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,250
That sand dune swallowed us!

399
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:49,500
I mean could you all please stop act like this doesn't happen everyday?

400
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,340
You're starting to make me feel really stupid!

401
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,780
Okay, hold on. Let's gather ourselves.

402
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,490
Take a deep breath in.

403
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:08,420
Fortunately...

404
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:12,630
I've been in this exact situation...three times before.

405
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:13,630
When?!

406
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,950
When have you ever been in this situation?!

407
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,730
I've never been in this situation before!

408
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,500
Just tryin' to keep up morale!

409
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,420
Oh god...

410
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,190
I sure hope that was a Coyote.

411
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,500
Good god, it's a feeding station!

412
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:34,510
If anyone knows about meal presentation, it's me.

413
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,120
Oh god, oh god!

414
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,310
Grab hands!

415
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:39,460
Create some momentum and swing over to that tree.

416
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,450
Extension!

417
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,030
Reach!

418
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,530
Good form everyone!

419
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,430
Working in concert!

420
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,050
Don't be afraid to point the toe!

421
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,470
One more!

422
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,290
One more should do it!

423
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,260
Everybody move out!

424
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,980
Cha-ka, your master commands you to-

425
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:17,580
Bad Cha-ka!

426
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,530
Your loyalty is now in question!

427
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,120
That was a Dinosaur?

428
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,090
T-Rex!

429
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:26,320
Definitely in predator mode!

430
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,560
Would you hurry up, you're slowing us down!

431
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,520
Why are you wearing high heels!

432
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,420
They're not high heels, they're my Floor Shine Zipper Boots!

433
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,930
Why are you wearing Floor Shines on a field expedition!

434
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,860
I told you I was no prepped to go into the field.

435
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,830
Wait, wait! We need a photo!

436
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,090
Nice field skills, Holly!

437
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:44,010
Stand over there!

438
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:44,440
What?!

439
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,430
This is proof that I'm right and I want photos.

440
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,780
Stand there we need you for scale!

441
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,430
Scale?!

442
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,480
Marshall, do we to turn on Red-Eye feature?

443
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:52,720
Yes! His eyes do look red.

444
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,070
Jesus Christ, just take the picture!

445
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,740
Okay just stand still!
-Stand still please.

446
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,910
One, two, three...

447
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,520
Fantastic, run!

448
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,320
Run like hell!

449
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,620
Where the hell's the monkey?

450
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:09,230
Look!

451
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,480
Cha-ka's waiting for us at the other end of the bridge!

452
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,030
Good Cha-ka, your master is pleased!

453
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,790
Marshall!

454
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:19,300
It really looks like he's just trying to destroy the bridge.

455
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,770
Chaka, wait!
 
456
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:21,960
Master not pleased!

457
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,700
It's okay, he can't cross he has terrible depth perception.

458
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,290
Thinks this chasm is a million miles long.

459
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:40,320
He's not what you'd call an athlete.

460
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,780
Mister T-Rexes.

461
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:42,910
See?

462
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,980
Walking away in utter, and helpless defeat.

463
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:49,400
After all their brain is the size of a walnut.

464
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:53,810
Their sense of smell may be acute, but eye sight, hearing, all of his higher functions,

465
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:57,100
completely compromised by that walnut sized brain pan.

466
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,020
I mean forget about the Polish.

467
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,070
It's the T-Rexes who were the real dummies of the world.

468
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,690
In fact Chaka, funny story...

469
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,620
Run!

470
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,230
Follow the monkey!

471
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,220
He's looking at you, Marshall.

472
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,190
He's watching you.

473
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,260
He's looking at everyone.

474
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,130
No I'm certain he's looking at you.

475
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,540
He is grumpy.

476
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,580
I think that's what we should call him, Grumpy.

477
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,260
It's a cute name.

478
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,340
Is it gone?

479
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,610
Yeah.

480
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:07,490
Pussy!

481
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,360
What a puss...

482
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,000
This'll work just fine.

483
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,160
We'll call this base camp.

484
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:26,190
No, no...we cannot stay here!

485
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,970
Bad things happen in caves folks, watch your movies!

486
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,530
Guys, can we just please take a minute to absorb this, I mean...

487
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:36,790
We must be, the first ones to ever step foot in this world, it's incredible!

488
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,370
Oh god, we're screwed.

489
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,050
No, no!

490
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:28,190
Chaka, no...No!

491
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,650
Okay you know what?

492
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,800
I don't want Chaka sleeping in the cave tonight.

493
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,470
Whoa! Not cool dude.

494
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,710
No, it's a reasonable precaution alright?

495
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,560
He was just about to be executed, and I think he might've done something to deserve it.

496
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,060
Hey my man is right here.

497
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,780
Obviously he has feeling, okay?

498
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,800
Doesn't have feelings!

499
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,110
Man, come on look at him he's adorable.

500
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,320
He's a little cuddle machine.

501
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:53,720
What?

502
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,870
Yeah, least you can do is let him defend himself.

503
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,100
I don't speak monkey.

504
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,040
Anyhow...do you?

505
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:00,530
No I didn't think so.

506
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:01,750
Here let me try.

507
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,730
Chaka?

508
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,790
He says he's a prince amongst his people.

509
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:23,560
And the victim of a treacherous plot to steal his throne.

510
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:28,230
And the only thing he's ever guilty of was...

511
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,640
Is love.

512
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,850
Brother, give me a break.

513
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:38,000
And he's been treated far  oo harshly for the very simple crime of...

514
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:41,010
Pooping in the village well.

515
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,910
That's why you're not sleeping in the cave.

516
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,570
I can't tell anymore.

517
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,470
Okay mister...

518
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:55,970
Silently - Fuck you!

519
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,330
Whoa, hold on! Where you going with that?

520
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,200
I'm just gonna block the point of the entry here so we're not vulnerable.

521
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,580
No...no...

522
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,060
Bless your heart.

523
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:09,400
Classic, tender foot mistake.

524
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,550
Don't beat yourself up over it.

525
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:13,010
Here's the thing.

526
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,780
Never put anything near the mouth of the cave to draw attention to us.

527
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:19,450
Did you not just see that we drew the attention
of a highly intelligent psycho Dinosaur?

528
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:23,670
Look I think the "Ph.D" after my name means
I know a little something about Dinosaurs?

529
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,150
Dinosaurs are creatures of brute instinct.

530
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:29,450
Like I said before it's got a brain the size of a walnut!

531
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:30,840
Okay? You got me?

532
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,150
A walnut.

533
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:34,680
What's that?

534
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,200
What's that?!

535
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,000
Sweet Gregor Mendel...

536
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,290
What? What is it?

537
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,980
It's a walnut.

538
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:15,220
Well, obviously this is between you and him.

539
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:22,360
Day 2, 0600...Zulu time.

540
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,950
Did not sleep last night at all.

541
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,500
Not one bit.

542
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,080
Still no sign of the tachyon amplifier our...our only way home.

543
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:35,570
Field rations are...are running dangerously low.

544
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:41,870
Thusly, I've made the determination that if need be, if faced with starvation...

545
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:45,170
we will cook and eat...Chaka.

546
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,430
I've been thinking about this a lot actually.

547
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:53,910
If Chaka meat were the secret ingredient on Iron Chef, I'm sure Bobbly Flay would,

548
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:57,980
probably serve it with a roasted red peppers, and a dash of cumin.

549
00:29:58,550 --> 00:29:59,850
And a braze of polenta.

550
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,750
Wouldn't be an easy thing to do but...

551
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:07,140
but if you slow roast the little guy
I'm sure that Chaka meat would just fall right off the bone.

552
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,070
Fruit train coming through!

553
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:13,410
Fantastic! I'm absolutely starving.

554
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:15,270
Which fruit shall I-

555
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,040
Whoa, hold on a second there Holly.

556
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,100
I don't recognize that genus of succulent.

557
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:22,330
Perhaps the native inhabitant can help us.

558
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,370
Chaka?

559
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:25,680
Rick Marshall!

560
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:26,550
Chaka!

561
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,640
Are they safe?

562
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:29,750
To eat?

563
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,930
Eat? Eat..eat?

564
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,890
Eat!

565
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,280
Eat, eat?

566
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:38,660
Thank you Chaka!

567
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,480
Thank you so much, for listening to me.

568
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,280
Sorry for doubting you my little friend.

 69
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:46,740
Has a pungent flavor, smells good!

570
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:47,970
Very meaty-

571
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,090
Jesus Chaka!

572
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:52,680
What the hell?!

573
00:30:58,330 --> 00:30:59,160
Friends?

574
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:00,700
Friends?

575
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,960
Well? Yes, technically I guess.

576
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:08,350
However I am your master.

577
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:11,360
We have entered into a verbal contract.

578
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,440
You need to understand that.

579
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,810
Holly, quick to the cave mouth.

580
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:20,720
Sentry positions!

581
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,680
Looks like a plasma discharge.

582
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:31,970
Or maybe beta-rays!

583
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,370
Marshall?

584
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:35,630
Marshall!

585
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,040
Marshall?

586
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,310
Help...

587
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:40,490
Me...

588
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,070
Please...

589
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:43,710
I will.

590
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,310
Marshall?

591
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,700
Marshall, where are you going?

592
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:49,740
Someone or something knows we're here.

593
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,610
It's in my head calling to me.

594
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:52,420
Get back Holly!

595
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,060
What are you doing?!

596
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,820
I've seen this before! He's got the jungle madness!

597
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,900
We gotta put him down while he's still has some dignity left!

598
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,110
Chaka, let's roll!

599
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:00,870
What?!

600
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:09,900
You see?

601
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:11,340
This is the place!

602
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,380
A beacon!

603
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,100
A transmitter!

604
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,240
Tapping directly into my prefontal lobe!

605
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,470
What the hell?!

606
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:22,410
Stop it!

607
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,690
Well I'll be...

608
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,350
I guess you weren't crazy.

609
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:26,410
Okay...

610
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:28,500
I'm man enough to say that's my bad.

611
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:34,620
Wow, has incredible architecture...almost like the almanac culture of Western America.

612
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,680
Reminds me of the prudential building.

613
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,490
I'll bet somebody's growing weed in here.

614
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:53,820
Feel that?

615
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:55,320
That ambient energy?

616
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,110
Just like at Devil's Canyon.

617
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:59,410
Yeah, tachyon radiation.

618
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,360
Marshall, the meter can't be far.

619
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,780
Finally something cool huh?

620
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,580
What, no reaction?

621
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:16,870
You guys have seen that before too I take it huh? In your lab...

622
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,100
What's this thing?

623
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,600
Maybe this is where ancient ancestors hosted the latin Grammy's.

624
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,720
Just picture Santana hauling this sucker around.

625
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:29,330
It vibrates.

626
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,810
I wouldn't touch that alright.

627
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,860
Do you believe in life after love!

628
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,870
That is so dumb and childish.

629
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,490
Do you believe in life after love!

630
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:45,090
Will could you please be quiet, Dr. Marshall needs silence.

631
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:48,710
I can feel something ins de me say

632
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:52,760
I really don't think you're strong enough, no!

633
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:56,660
Really feel it in my forearms.

634
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,360
Yeah, you usually have to pay for something like this.

635
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,210
Holly you should sit on this.

636
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,420
What?

637
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:09,480
What is it Chaka?

638
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,530
What'd you say?

639
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:13,790
What's he saying?

640
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,760
I don't know if this is anything I've ever learned...Sarisa?

641
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:17,010
Sarisa Taka?

642
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:18,580
Chorizo Tacos?

643
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,350
Are you saying Chorizo Tacos?

644
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,350
Don't play around because I am super hungry.

645
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,170
Sarisa-?

646
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,870
What the hell does that mean?

647
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:29,900
Well...

648
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:31,590
I'm afraid we'll never know.

649
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,520
Okay...

650
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,380
Oh shit it's not Chorizo Tacos.

651
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:50,710
No immediate danger, cold blooded and slow.

652
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:54,320
I repeat, no immediate danger.

653
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,680
Would you stop that?! Please! You are freaking me out!

654
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,370
They're everywhere!

655
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,600
Just like zombies!

656
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:06,860
That's how zombies get you! Volume!

657
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,040
We're all gonna die!

658
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,190
Like hell...

659
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,210
I'm gonna take at least one of these bastards with me,

660
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:15,180
even if you have to choke to death on my skull!

661
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:18,390
What you want some too do you?

662
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,080
What are you guys doing?!

663
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:21,830
One second...

664
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,760
What in the hell?

665
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:38,030
Get in!

666
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,970
Wait stand down Holly.

667
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,060
Hang on...

668
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:47,290
Hang on I think we're safe.

669
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,220
They don't seem to be able to make it through the entrance.

670
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,420
Thank god for that.

671
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,330
That one keeps peering into my soul.

672
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:53,520
This is just fantastic.

673
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:56,860
Now we're just going to stand in here and suffocate in this tiny little...

674
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,230
Huge...

675
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,600
Thingy...

676
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,090
Wow that is an efficient use of space.

677
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:04,700
Like Snoopy's dog house.

678
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,450
Look, there's a gold one.

679
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,210
Let's stomp his head in.

680
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,220
Do not fear me.

681
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:14,160
I am Enik

682
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,960
The Altrusian.

683
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,650
Thank Vindok you've come to my aid Rick Marshall.

684
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:20,900
You know me?

685
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:21,900
Of course.

686
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:26,230
Even in the farthest reachest of the universe we've seen your Matt Lauer video.

687
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,520
I am a prisoner in this Land of the Lost.

688
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:32,400
Only you can help me escape.

689
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,410
The fate of the universe depends on you.

690
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,020
Well...

691
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,590
Thats very flattering...Enik.

692
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,580
But I th nk you've found the wrong guy.

693
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:47,380
No Rick Marshall, I have summoned you here
specifically to help me stop an evil mad man who

694
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,560
has already conquered my world.

695
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:52,350
And now plans to conquer yours.

696
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:53,570
His name is...

697
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:56,110
The Zarn.

698
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:00,420
I am the Zarn, heed my warning or be destroyed.

699
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:05,300
The Zarn became obsessed with using the power of these crystals to conquer the universe.

700
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,230
If he is not stopped he will open a doorway to your world,

701
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:14,570
and lead his army of Sleestak on a rampage across time and space.

702
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,110
He must be stopped.

703
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,450
Enik...

704
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,540
Buddy...

705
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:22,540
I'm a scientist, you're a scientist.

706
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:25,580
Subs by THEO
I think together you and I could figure this out.

707
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,120
You mustn't touch the crystals!

708
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:33,370
Wrong manipulation of the crystals could turn time and space inside out.

709
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,260
What do you need from us?

710
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:38,630
The Zarn lacks only one thing to enact his evil plan.

711
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:43,960
A device to amplify tachyons and unleash the full power of the crystals.

712
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:47,360
Well Marshall has created a device that isolates tachyon interference.

713
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,380
Yeah I did that.

714
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:54,500
Of course, with tachyon particles focused along the proper temporal vector...

715
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:59,250
...a stable passage way could be opened to any point in the space time continuum.

716
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:01,770
You and I are so smart.

717
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:05,880
Rick Marshall, I knew instantly you could help me.

718
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,660
Thank you.

719
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:09,330
You are a truly advanced intellect.

720
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:12,450
I don't know how you manage amongst these others.

721
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:14,640
I don't know how I do it either, I really don't!

722
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,720
Excuse me?!

723
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:18,070
You have this tachyon amplifier?

724
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:21,970
I lost it on the way in, I don't know where...it could be lost in time.

725
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:23,720
On the contrary I detect it nearby.

726
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,870
It...

727
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:25,980
Strange...

728
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:29,170
I cannot precisely pin point its location it...

729
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,390
...moves.

730
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,000
Leave it to us.

731
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,140
If it's out there.

732
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:33,960
We'll find it.

733
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,300
Not so fast amigo.

734
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,050
Little rule I live by.

735
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:39,110
Never trust a dude in a tunic.

736
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,910
You live by that rule?

737
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:41,640
Yes.

738
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:43,250
It's never led me astray.

739
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,130
Come on Enik, are you well enough to travel?

740
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:47,670
No, my place is here in the pylon.

741
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,370
I must protect the crystals.

742
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:54,570
If you wish to return home these crystals are the doorway. Your device is the key.

743
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,150
Find it before the Zarn does.

744
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,920
Bring it to me, and rescue us all.

745
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,420
Rescue the uni-verse.

746
00:39:05 680 --> 00:39:07,210
Alright everyone gather around.

747
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,190
Let's go, chop chop.

748
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,220
Hustle up.

749
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:12,310
Marshall did you just make that?

750
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,490
Yeah, I'm a bit of a miniatures enthusiast.

751
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,520
It's very impressive.

752
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:19,020
Thank you.

753
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,720
Yeah well I see some obvious scaling issues...

754
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,880
I think its pretty damn good.

755
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:25,090
Alright.

756
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,390
We are here.

757
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:28,770
As you can see desert, forest...

758
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,750
What's this look like?

759
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:31,910
The cave.

760
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:33,250
That's the cave, that's where we're living.

761
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:34,670
Standard volcano.

762
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:35,620
Okay?

763
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,180
Now, I will tether Will to this hot air balloon right here.

764
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:43,510
Okay, it will be fitted with a crude tachyon reflector array

765
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:45,700
that I fashioned out of a thermal blanket and cell phone charger.

766
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,340
I don't remember ever volunteering for that.

767
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,250
Holly!

768
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:53,000
You and I will follow Will's directions as he searches for the tell-tale ping of the missing,

769
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,560
and still presumably operational tachyon meter.

770
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:59,230
Oh god, he's close.

771
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:00,560
I've taken care of that.

772
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:04,740
During the course of my professional career I've done extensive research with,

773
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:07,510
reptiles and various birds of prey of which Dinosaurs are.

774
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:08,790
Well that's disputable.

775
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:09,580
Please be quiet.

776
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:12,060
They have a very acute sense of smell.

777
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:16,930
Now, while I gathered this strictly for genetic research to be used upon our return,

778
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:19,780
I think it would prove wise to use this now.

779
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:21,480
Hadrosaur urine.

780
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:22,610
We're going to cover our-

781
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:23,440
Whoa, wait.

782
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,390
What is that?

783
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:25,840
Hadrosaur urine.

784
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,140
How'd you get that?

785
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:31,100
Well while you are sleeping, I'm out gathering research.

786
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:31,890
Okay?

787
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,380
This was to be used for genetic engineering.

788
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,950
And I was going to write a report on kidney function.

789
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,210
But now it'll just be camouflage, we'll all blend in.

790
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,590
Okay? So...

791
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:42,680
We will cover ourselves-

792
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,440
I'm sorry, so sorry.

793
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,690
I'm just trying to figure this out.

794
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:49,160
So you've been gathering urine?

795
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,260
Yes, what's the problem?

796
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:55,170
That means you stood under a dino dung, with a bucket.

797
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:03,070
If you want to be technical and reduce it to it's basis element...yes I was.

798
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,790
How'd that work out for you?

799
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,970
Are you honestly asking me?

800
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:09,210
Yeah.

801
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:11,770
It's very peaceful.

802
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:13,950
Just a little bit  ike fly fishing.

803
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:20,940
Just out there in the night air still calm, and then zing you get a big catch.

804
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:27,420
Okay so, we'll cover our bodies in urine, and we'll be virtually undetectable to all Dinosaurs.

805
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,590
Here they come, should've thought of this a long time ago.

806
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:39,110
That's refreshing.

807
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:41,610
Make sure to ingest some get that in the blood stream.

808
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:49,690
Don't do that.

809
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:52,920
Okay, whose next?

810
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:56,640
Really?

811
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,240
It's not that bad.

812
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:04,160
Just starting to burn my eyes a little bit did not plan for it.

813
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:07,560
It get's up in the nostrils too, you do not want that.

814
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,630
That's early morning stuff.

815
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,160
That is strong.

816
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:19,170
Maybe a second splash will reduce some of the effects.

817
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,980
Immediately made it worse.

818
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,690
Where's my laser pointer? Nevermind.

819
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:28,830
We will probably have to be doing...

820
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:35,610
Whose that?

821
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,620
Maybe we should just follow him.

822
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:43,510
Nice model though.

823
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:47,420
Yeah fine, let's forget my model and let's follow the monkey.

824
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,020
Shut up Chaka!

825
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:58,430
Are we there yet?

826
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,310
You find this funny Chaka?

827
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:03,510
This is the damn Bhutan death march out here.

828
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:12,090
My god...

829
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:14,510
Absolutely incredible.

830
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,310
This must be the main entry point into this world.

831
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:22,030
It's like...a cosmic lost and found.

832
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,810
Wow look at all this kick ass shit to steal.

833
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,400
This is like the world's greatest mall.

834
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,110
Yeah, Will, it's just like a mall.

835
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:29,940
The only thing it's missing is a food court.

836
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,690
Compsognathus! Look how they move!

837
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,300
Where all these little chupacabres going to?

838
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,870
I'll tell you where they're going to.

839
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,870
Our raft, tachyon meter can't be far.

840
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:41,780
Our raft? That's my raft.

841
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:44,640
Get away from there! Stop pecking at my raft!

842
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,730
There's your food court.

843
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:51,330
Ice cream...

844
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:52,660
Hey! What're you doing?

845
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:55,140
What? I'm gonna poney up and get Chaka a cone, it's his first.

846
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:58,250
No there's a reason those Dinosaurs hang out there, they know.

847
00:43:59,040 --> 00:43:59,780
They know what?

848
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:01,120
It's feeding time.

849
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:41,110
Tyrannosaurus female!

850
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,760
We're in luck.

851
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:49,800
These large predators are extremely territorial, virtually nothing will distract them from each other.

852
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:56,140
Oh crap balls.

853
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:57,330
Whaddya know?

854
00:44:57,430 --> 00:45:00,370
This is one of those situations where dumping piss on your head's a bad idea.

855
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:01,420
Run!

856
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,740
Wait Chaka!

857
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:07,960
Lead your m ster to safety!

858
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:13,580
Chaka no!

859
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:14,840
Why?!

860
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,470
You're a little asshole Chaka!

861
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:21,610
Spread out! It'll confuse them!

862
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,590
Try running in serpentine patterns!

863
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:26,260
He's incapable of rapid forward direction!

864
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,380
Serpentine everyone!

865
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:29,800
Serpentine!

866
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:31,190
Serpentine!

867
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:32,800
Serpentine!!

868
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,690
No! Serpentine!

869
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:36,260
Serpentine!!

870
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:40,440
Son of a kid!

871
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:43,640
Hey Marshall, you ever get tired of being wrong?

872
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:47,460
I do, I really do! I'm so tired!

873
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,760
Get on your horse Rick Marshall!

874
00:45:57,570 --> 00:45:59,080
Fascinating but terrifying!

875
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:22,830
No!

876
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,250
Marshall!

877
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:25,580
Still here!

878
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:27,540
I hope you're taping this!

879
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:28,460
I got it!

880
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:55,520
I don't want to die in a hummer!

881
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:07,990
A massacre...

882
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:23,070
Gross!

883
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,730
Set the catapult!

884
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:34,540
What?!

885
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:36,600
Set the catapult!

886
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:38,110
What?!

887
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,500
Set the fuckin' catapult!

888
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:41,810
This thing?!

889
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:43,510
Catapult! Now!

890
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:46,580
No no, take her that way! Go that way!

891
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:47,920
Just do it!

892
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,170
Come on!

893
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,950
How the hell do you set a catapult!

894
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:52,140
I don't know, just turn it!

895
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,070
One!

896
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:56,000
Two!

897
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:57,640
Three!

898
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,260
Crank that thing!

899
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:07,460
Oh no!

900
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,080
Crank that mother!

901
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:10,980
I'm coming in hot!

902
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:15,980
Keep going!

903
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:17,770
Put your back into it!

904
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:20,830
The package has arrived.

905
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:21,770
What's the package?

906
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:23,610
It's a canister of refridgerant.

907
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:25,750
Now!

908
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:40,730
I did not expect that.

909
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:57,430
Gay showtunes!

910
00:48:58,180 --> 00:48:59,750
Cassie...Beebe.

911
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:01,120
Tachyon meter!

912
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:19,140
Oh that blows.

913
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:20,580
That...

914
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:22,600
BLOWS...

915
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:39,350
Marshall?

916
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:42,860
What're you doing?

917
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:45,530
I'm giving up.

918
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:47,980
It feels good.

919
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:50,320
But what about finding our way home?

920
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:54,940
Validation for your life's work, you just going give that all up just to lie here.

921
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:56,420
No no of course not.

922
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,290
Lying here is just phase one of the plan.

923
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:01,570
It's phase two that gets me really excited.

924
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:08,180
It involves adjusting the angle of my recline, and putting this hand halfway down my pants.

925
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:10,460
D ceptively simple yet elegant.

926
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:12,350
Yeah, I tried.

927
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:13,520
I failed.

928
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:16,680
And you know what, once again it's my own vault.

929
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,850
You mean fault.

930
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:19,560
No, I actually mean vault.

931
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:22,030
It's from a poster with a pole vaulter on it.

932
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:23,750
That's really freaking stupid man.

933
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:25,210
I can't believe I'm hearing this.

934
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:27,170
Any scientist in his right mind wouldn't give-

935
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:29,280
Initiating phase two.

936
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:34,300
Do you know how I first heard about you?

937
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:35,830
As a joke.

938
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:40,150
First year at Cambridge we used to email your
little appearance with Matt Lauer around for a laugh.

939
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:44,130
I mean as you tube hall of fame
moments goes, it was Matt Lauer versus Marshall,

940
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,620
and then that monkey pissin' in his own face.

941
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:47,980
In that order.

942
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:49,590
But I wasn't laughing.

943
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,550
Because I fascinated. I saw a man who was willing to
swim dangerous waters for the sake of his need to know.

944
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:59,540
I took that to heart Dr. Marshall, I've committed
myself to your theories and I got tossed out of Cambridge for it.

945
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,710
For my theories, you threw your future away?

946
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:04,220
Yeah that's what everyone told me.

947
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:07,160
But I didn't believe it, not 'til now.

948
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:16,540
Have you seen this monkey video?

949
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:20,260
Yeah, I've seen it about a dozen times.

950
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:22,650
God bless the internet.

951
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:24,100
Come on Chaka.

952
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:25,630
Let's work on our mission statement.

953
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:41,950
How's it going?

954
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,970
What's wrong little guy, you okay?

955
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:47,820
Lady troubles?

956
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:51,040
Tell me about it.

957
00:51:51,870 --> 00:51:54,250
This obviously stays between me and you but...

958
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,460
I'm coming up on a 6 year dry spell.

959
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:10,120
He says that he misses his tribe, it's a beautiful existence

960
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:14,010
They're carefree and nomadic, and live where the food lives.

961
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:15,400
Just like me.

962
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,260
I moved "tres" times just to be closer to a Ruby Tuesdays.

963
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:19,690
Continue.

964
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:25,790
Their women wait on the men, serve in all their needs.

965
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:27,670
I'm liking this, continue.

966
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:34,620
They're ugly, but they make up for it in nice personalities.

967
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:44,650
He says as prince of his tribe he personally is served by a heron of 7,000 women.

968
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:46,990
Wow, not bad little dude.

969
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:51,570
And they bring him all accruements of food, and-

970
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:55,240
Yeah, you get the idea I'm not translating that.

971
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,260
Any room around that fire for a jerk like me?

972
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,740
Thought you gave up?

973
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:18,380
I did.

974
00:53:19,210 --> 00:53:20,850
I gave up on giving up.

975
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:24,840
Sat out there for a long time.

976
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:30,040
Just me, my shame and this little 4 string.

977
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,390
I've had a change of hear .

978
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:37,370
Tried too long and hard to think something to say to you guys.

979
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:40,680
Well, I realized there wasn't anything to say.

980
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:42,580
But maybe...

981
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:44,000
Just maybe...

982
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:45,970
There's something I could sing.

983
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:46,980
No really it's alright-

984
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:49,470
Marshall...Will and Holly...

985
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:53,020
On a routine expedition.

986
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:58,370
Met the greatest earthquake ever known.

987
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:00,830
That's all I got.

988
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:01,790
That's fine.

989
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:03,040
Apology accepted.

990
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,190
Thanks, you guys are being so generous.

991
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:07,570
Really appreciate it, I think the healing has begun.

992
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:14,440
Met the greatest earthquake ever known...

993
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:18,060
High on the rapids.

994
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:21,370
It struck their tiny raft.

995
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:23,320
That's good.

996
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:25,500
And plunged them down-

997
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:28,750
I'm so tired.

998
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:32,790
A thousand feet below.

999
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:34,450
I'm feeling weak.

1000
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:36,150
Really bushwacked.

1001
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:40,060
Anyway here's how I end it, a little arpeggio nothing fancy.

1002
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:44,520
Guys, I'm sleepy.

1003
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:46,720
The Land...

1004
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:50,910
Land...of the Lost-

1005
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:56,360
I'm so tired!

1006
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:07,600
What happened?

1007
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,290
You had a bug on you.

1008
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:11,940
But it's gone now.

1009
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:13,950
Oh okay.

1010
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,160
Alright everyone!

1011
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,400
Rise and shine.

1012
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:43,640
Listen up, it's a new day.

1013
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:45,670
Yes we've had a set back.

1014
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:49,850
Yes it is tempting to stay on this world and die.

1015
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:52,440
But thats not how a new Marshall rolls.

1016
00:55:52,770 --> 00:55:53,750
You hear me?

1017
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:55,410
Not by a damn sight.

1018
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:58,680
This isn't hands down the pants Marshall.

1019
00:55:58,870 --> 00:55:59,930
Alright?

1020
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:05,010
This is a Gordon on 2 pints of Ben & Jerry's and a whole spiral cut ham while watching not one,

1021
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:06,900
but two Mama's Family reunion Marshall.

1022
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:08,090
Uh-Uh!

1023
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,150
He's gone.

1024
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:10,800
Here's the deal.

1025
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:12,570
Enik's counting on us.

1026
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:14,340
The whole world is counting on us.

1027
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:18,680
If we have any hope of returning home
we need to take back that tachyon meter, and take it back hard.

1028
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,250
That means climbing.

1029
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:23,340
Hours of arduous climbing up sheer cliffs.

1030
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:24,670
Not tomorrow.

1031
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:25,920
Not in a few hours.

1032
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:27,060
But right now!

1033
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,220
Understood?

1034
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:28,990
Yeah.

1035
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:29,990
Understood Will?

1036
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:30,830
Hmm?

1037
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,740
Let's move out you panzies.

1038
00:56:33,350 --> 00:56:36,420
Hey! This is not a race.

1039
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:37,700
Okay?

1040
 0:57:06,430 --> 00:57:07,600
What the hell?

1041
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:11,450
Teradachtyl eggs incubating all over her lair.

1042
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,910
There's your shitty boombox.

1043
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:17,920
Across a sea of thin volcanic glass.

1044
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:23,380
Okay Will, what you're gonna want to do is evenly distribute your weight,

1045
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:26,160
at the same time keep an eye out for the eggs.

1046
00:57:26,930 --> 00:57:28,590
Hey, Will?

1047
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:30,150
I know you're faking.

1048
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:32,290
Okay, Chaka!

1049
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:34,520
Chaka!

1050
00:57:35,610 --> 00:57:36,370
Come on.

1051
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:38,190
Fine.

1052
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:42,330
Maybe I'll need to listen to the words of a group
of young kids words trying to make it on stage.

1053
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:43,690
God I hope I get it.

1054
00:57:44,850 --> 00:57:45,810
I hope I get it.

1055
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:47,030
Marshall?

1056
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:50,150
Be careful.

1057
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:52,980
I'm up!

1058
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:54,060
I'm up I got this.

1059
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:55,870
Oh Marshall, you got it.

1060
00:57:58,680 --> 00:57:59,600
Do me a favor?

1061
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,920
Just keep an eye on the mother okay?

1062
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,060
You mustn't change the surface temperature of the eggs,

1063
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:06,090
any drop of sweat could activate hatching process.

1064
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,470
I got it.

1065
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:36,900
I got it!

1066
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:07,940
They're hatching!

1067
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,030
Why are they hatching?!

1068
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:10,050
The music!

1069
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,590
It must be like a lullaby.

1070
00:59:18,330 --> 00:59:19,510
God I hope I get it!

1071
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:21,020
I hope I get it!

1072
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:24,020
How many people does he need?

1073
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:27,070
God I hope I get it!

1074
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:28,630
I hope I get it!

1075
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:31,620
How many boys, how many girls?

1076
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:34,100
Look at all the people!

1077
00:59:34,610 --> 00:59:35,760
At all the people!

1078
00:59:36,270 --> 00:59:37,830
How many people does he need?

1079
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:39,580
How many boys, how many girls?

1080
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:40,810
How many people does he-

1081
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:43,560
I really need this job.

1082
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:46,300
Please God I need this job.

1083
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:50,970
I've got to get this job!

1084
01:00:27,110 --> 01:00:29,090
I'm gonna miss this place that proves I was right.

1085
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:42,990
Oh drink?

1086
01:00:42,990 --> 01:00:44,050
Drink, yes!

1087
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,040
That is delicious and refreshing.

1088
01:00:49,830 --> 01:00:51,930
Sweet and sour like Chinese food.

1089
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,750
He's saying it's a celebratory drink in his village.

1090
01:00:57,110 --> 01:00:57,890
Cheers!

1091
01:01:00,770 --> 01:01:03,810
It brings a joyful lightness to the heart and soul.

1092
01:01:06,450 --> 01:01:08,000
No, I'm sorry its not joyful lightness.

1093
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,430
A better translation would be, howling loneliness.

1094
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:17,220
And then your bravery will be tested and your mind folds.

1095
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:24,450
And the shadow hats will rise from their graves and hold you in an icy embrace.

1096
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:29,900
And it'll feel like...your bowels being pierced.

1097
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:32,490
By a ghost serpent.

1098
01:01:34,270 --> 01:01:35,470
Well that can't be right.

1099
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:37 140
No, that can't be right.

1100
01:01:37,310 --> 01:01:41,330
Chaka, maki rishu...dong doh?

1101
01:01:43,650 --> 01:01:45,200
Oh okay, so it's not ghost serpent.

1102
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,000
It's much much closer to zombie dick.

1103
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:52,390
I think it might be a narcotic.

1104
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:54,560
Is that so?

1105
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:58,960
Need you to be honest with me okay?

1106
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:01,140
Are you a cop?

1107
01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:06,370
That's not an answer Chaka.

1108
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:07,890
That's your name.

1109
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:12,490
Seriously, by law you have to tell me if you're an officer.

1110
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,110
Marco
-Polo

1111
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:15,430
You wearing a wire?

1112
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:24,790
Marco
-Polo

1113
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:30,870
Hello!

1114
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,060
Hot coffee.

1115
01:03:22,110 --> 01:03:23,430
I need food.

1116
01:03:23,830 --> 01:03:24,720
Marshall!

1117
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:25,350
Yeah?

1118
01:03:25,350 --> 01:03:26,650
Fruit me buddy!

1119
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:07,140
Chaka?

1120
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:10,960
I owe you an apology.

1121
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:12,630
Okay, I...

1122
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:15,560
I'm a guest in your land.

1123
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:19,040
A guest who came unannounced, uninvited.

1124
01:04:20,710 --> 01:04:22,390
I've treated you like a toilet.

1125
01:04:23,310 --> 01:04:24,200
A toilet!

1126
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:26,800
I want to make it up to you.

1127
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:32,440
Because the love I feel for you, I'm not exaggerating...

1128
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:41,480
Is a billion times greater than the love for mankind that Jesus felt on the cross.

1129
01:04:43,610 --> 01:04:44,990
You can take that to the bank.

1130
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:49,840
I'm so glad you guys squashed that.

1131
01:04:50,790 --> 01:04:51,960
I love you guys so much.

1132
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:53,980
You guys are amazing.

1133
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,720
I don't ever want to go home.

1134
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:57,090
No.

1135
01:04:57,580 --> 01:04:59,180
This is just like Sandal's resort.

1136
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:01,930
Just good people, a lot of good food.

1137
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:03,360
Good times.

1138
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,620
I want to make this my life.

1139
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:08,400
I'm just gonna make- ...be here all the time.

1140
01:05:14,420 --> 01:05:15,780
Hey hey!

1141
01:05:15,950 --> 01:05:16,940
You're funny Chaka!

1142
01:05:17,090 --> 01:05:17,810
He's hilarious!

1143
01:05:17,810 --> 01:05:18,610
You're funny.

1144
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:20,010
His jokes are disgusting.

1145
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:23,840
You're funny.

1146
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:24,920
Hey for real though?

1147
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:29,630
How much money would I have to pay ya'll to french kiss each other?

1148
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:31,740
For real?

1149
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:33,120
Totally real!

1150
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:34,500
For real, for real?

1151
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:36,590
Totally, in his mucky mouth.

1152
01:05:37,540 --> 01:05:41,290
Hey if it doesn't leave the three of us, I'll do for free right now.

1153
01:05:41,390 --> 01:05:42,630
It's not gonna leave here.

1154
01:05:43,350 --> 01:05:44,360
I'd do it right now.

1155
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:45,480
Let me see it.

1156
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:47,500
Kiss him.

1157
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:49,240
It doesn't leave the three of us?

1158
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:50,900
No dude, I won't tell anybody.

1159
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:51,940
Who am I gonna tell?

1160
01:05:53,110 --> 01:05:54,000
Why don't you kiss him?

1161
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:54,710
I'm gonna do it!

1162
01: 5:54,840 --> 01:05:55,630
Come here!

1163
01:06:01,010 --> 01:06:02,380
You guys are gross!

1164
01:06:04,730 --> 01:06:07,390
I don't wanna do it!

1165
01:06:08,410 --> 01:06:09,390
I don't want to do it!

1166
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:11,710
I've changed my mind!

1167
01:06:21,730 --> 01:06:22,860
Dinosaur eggs!

1168
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:26,000
Dinosaur poo...

1169
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,910
This is the Zarn!

1170
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:42,530
Heed my warning or be destroyed!

1171
01:06:42,850 --> 01:06:44,430
We're just trying to get home!

1172
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,950
Enik the Altrusian has escaped our custody!

1173
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:50,070
He's over taken the central pylon and the crystals.

1174
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:55,050
And now plans to lead his army of Sleestak on a rampage, across time and space!

1175
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:59,730
If you're hearing this, heed my warning. Do not believe-

1176
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:03,080
No! Enik! No!

1177
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,090
The Zarn?

1178
01:07:27,890 --> 01:07:29,180
I've gotta go and warn the-

1179
01:07:49,010 --> 01:07:49,900
Holly?

1180
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:55,410
Holly...?

1181
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:04,460
They've taken Holly.

1182
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:06,560
Chaka!

1183
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:07,860
I've got a mission for you.

1184
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:09,260
Now listen closely.

1185
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:23,380
I don't know what that means.

1186
01:08:23,550 --> 01:08:24,630
Just come on!

1187
01:08:32,330 --> 01:08:33,220
Oh man.

1188
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:36,610
Sentries, classic hive behavior.

1189
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:38,610
Obviously on patrol.

1190
01:08:39,290 --> 01:08:41,930
Just like drones tirelessly hunting.

1191
01:08:42,090 --> 01:08:44,130
Dude, it looks like they're gettin' ready to make out?

1192
01:08:44,590 --> 01:08:45,880
No. No.

1193
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:56,580
He's about to tap that ass!

1194
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,050
Would you shut up?

1195
01:08:58,050 --> 01:08:59,440
He's not about to tap that ass.

1196
01:09:01,730 --> 01:09:02,820
Oh you're right.

1197
01:09:03,330 --> 01:09:04,640
He's totally tapping that ass.

1198
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:08,310
Yeah wow...Our own little private show.

1199
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:17,660
Oh god, they shed.

1200
01:09:37,230 --> 01:09:38,010
Hi.

1201
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:39,200
Hey don't do that.

1202
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:40,830
Just focus.

1203
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:49,890
We find you guilty, for providing assistance to Enik the Altrusian.

1204
01:09:50,450 --> 01:09:51,450
There she is!

1205
01:09:51,670 --> 01:09:54,630
Prepare the meet the Sleestak god!

1206
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:55,260
Stop!

1207
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:56,220
Marshall!

1208
01:09:56,220 --> 01:09:57,630
Do not interfere!

1209
01:09:57,630 --> 01:09:59,000
Dude, what the hell are you doing?

1210
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,790
This one was caught trying to deliver a tachyon device to Enik!

1211
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:04,960
You want Holly? You've gotta deal with us!

1212
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,000
No, Marshall don't.

1213
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,730
Because we're all friends of Enik!

1214
01:10:09,870 --> 01:10:15,080
Enik the Altrusian is guilty of the destruction of an entire civilization.

1215
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:16,060
Entire what now?

1216
01:10:16,150 --> 01:10:21,140
Convicted of his crimes, he was sentenced to 10,000 years imprisonment.

1217
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:21,830
What?

1218
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:26,360
And made to wear a tunic as a symbol of his deceit.

1219
01:10:26,670 --> 01:10:28,130
Told you dude, tunic.

1220
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:31,700
As his allies, you shall die as well.

1221
01:10:31,850 --> 01:10:32,800
Sieze them!

1222
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:36,530
Marshall! 

1223
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:40,900
Hold on!

1224
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:18,610
Wait!

1225
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:21,460
Wait a minute, our working relationship.

1226
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:27,760
I wanted to do that since I first met you.

1227
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,830
You mean we could've been doing this the whole time?

1228
01:11:29,830 --> 01:11:32,500
Yeah, but I was worried it wouldn't be professional and distract you from your work.

1229
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:34,060
No, no...not distracting.

1230
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:35,540
Never distracting.

1231
01:11:37,310 --> 01:11:39,480
Are you guys kidding me? Come on! Really!

1232
01:11:39,610 --> 01:11:41,320
Now is the time for this?

1233
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:42,640
You know he's-

1234
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:44,670
He's right, we've got to stop Enik!

1235
01:11:45,110 --> 01:11:46,340
Right now  he has the upper hand.

1236
01:11:47,270 --> 01:11:48,070
I know we...

1237
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:49,850
have the element of surprise but...

1238
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:54,670
Yeah about that...

1239
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:57,210
What?

1240
01:11:57,810 --> 01:12:00,370
We sent Chaka to go get him.

1241
01:12:05,790 --> 01:12:06,820
Well then.

1242
01:12:07,010 --> 01:12:08,840
Rick Marshall.

1243
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:12,300
Coming here represents a slight adjustment to my plans but no matter.

1244
01:12:12,970 --> 01:12:14,530
I have what I need.

1245
01:12:14,970 --> 01:12:18,150
And it's all thanks to you, Dr. Marshall.

1246
01:12:18,710 --> 01:12:19,660
And this!

1247
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:22,690
Don't! We're out gunned.

1248
01:12:22,830 --> 01:12:24,960
My Sleestack stand prepared.

1249
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:28,990
With the power of the crystals they are my slaves.

1250
01:12:29,250 --> 01:12:30,580
My conquering army.

1251
01:12:31,310 --> 01:12:32,530
Thanks to your device.

1252
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:38,040
I can lead an invasion force anywhere I choose, in all of time and space.

1253
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:41,270
But I believe I'll begin with your Earth.

1254
01:12:41,820 --> 01:12:44,360
My Sleestak's reproduce rather quickly.

1255
01:12:44,470 --> 01:12:46,350
Yeah we already caught some of that action.

1256
01:12:46,610 --> 01:12:51,260
In merely weeks, your world will be overrun by their scaly offspring.

1257
01:12:52,170 --> 01:12:56,060
And left standing in the cinders of your civilization.

1258
01:12:56,370 --> 01:12:59,700
I'll be sure to give you full scientific credit.

1259
01:13:00,990 --> 01:13:03,320
I know how important that is to you.

1260
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:05,740
Now save your strength.

1261
01:13:06,530 --> 01:13:07,530
You'll need it.

1262
01:13:10,650 --> 01:13:11,780
You'll need it?

1263
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:13,160
What is it?

1264
01:13:18,390 --> 01:13:19,290
Marshall?

1265
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:23,930
Oh great.

1266
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,520
Right, you run and I'll distract him he's not after me.

1267
01:13:34,890 --> 01:13:36,940
No, I'm not running.

1268
01:13:38,050 --> 01:13:38,950
This ends here.

1269
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:41,280
Marshall, what are you doing?

1270
01:13:42,350 --> 01:13:43,800
Maybe what I was always meant to do.

1271
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:48,680
Now just go, I'll meet you at the pylon, I hope.

1272
01:13:48,750 --> 01:13:50,170
No we're not leaving without you.

1273
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:51,300
Go!

1274
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:54,140
Get out of here, I don't love you!

1275
01:13:57,380 --> 01:13:57,960
Go!

1276
01:13:58,030 --> 01:13:59,250
Marshall!

1277
01:13:59,770 --> 01:14:00,670
Get!

1278
01:14:00,670 --> 01:14:01,760
You're ugly!

1279
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:13,290
Look, if you're gonna do this for real take this.

1280
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:15,890
Got some high powered fireworks in here that might come  n handy.

1281
01:14:15,890 --> 01:14:16,870
Are you kidding me?

1282
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:20,880
You mean you've been carrying a bag of fireworks around with you this whole time?

1283
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:24,170
There's literally a dozen situations where we could've used these.

1284
01:14:26,510 --> 01:14:28,760
He's right, none of that is important now okay?

1285
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:30,000
Listen...

1286
01:14:30,770 --> 01:14:32,790
I gotta be straight with you bro, I misjudged you.

1287
01:14:32,790 --> 01:14:34,290
I thought you were just a...

1288
01:14:34,650 --> 01:14:36,900
...dumbass dude who dressed stupid, but I'm wrong.

1289
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:38,080
You're solid.

1290
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:43,860
Thick or thin, I will follow you into battle at anytime, you hear me?

1291
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:46,510
Absolutely anytime.

1292
01:14:46,830 --> 01:14:48,950
Okay! How about now?

1293
01:14:49,290 --> 01:14:50,330
Like, right now?

1294
01:14:50,330 --> 01:14:50,640
Yeah.

1295
01:14:52,940 --> 01:14:53,790
Honestly?

1296
01:14:54,030 --> 01:14:56,380
I didn't really expect you to call the favor in this soon.

1297
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:59,770
So, on this one unfortunately I'm gonna have to say no.

1298
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:04,500
But I think it's gonna be awesome for you for personal growth just to hit this one solo.

1299
01:15:05,130 --> 01:15:06,200
I'm gonna be rootin' for ya.

1300
01:15:06,570 --> 01:15:07,410
Okay?

1301
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:08,660
Trenches bro.

1302
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:10,520
It's all about love.

1303
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:12,210
Okay?

1304
01:15:13,110 --> 01:15:13,970
After this time.

1305
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:16,060
I'm there for you, okay?

1306
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:17,680
Anytime after now.

1307
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:20,870
He's your man, not me.

1308
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:54,890
Alright, it's a fact.

1309
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:56,990
You and I don't like each other.

1310
01:15:59,770 --> 01:16:01,550
Only one will remain.

1311
01:16:02,610 --> 01:16:04,920
Just gonna have to fight you at your own game.

1312
01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:21,030
Damn you're quick, it's because you're a dinosaur!

1313
01:16:21,370 --> 01:16:24,190
But, you don't carry around these, do you?

1314
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:29,130
Welcome to the big bang theory my friend!

1315
01:16:47,430 --> 01:16:48,330
Stupid...

1316
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:55,880
You're cornered man, there's no way out!

1317
01:16:56,220 --> 01:16:57,370
There's always a way out!

1318
01:16:59,910 --> 01:17:01,300
Because if you don't make it...

1319
01:17:03,050 --> 01:17:05,560
It's your own damn vault.

1320
01:17:32,710 --> 01:17:34,250
My god! He's going to do it!

1321
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:35,680
Do it! Do it!

1322
01:17:43,670 --> 01:17:44,440
God!

1323
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:47,420
Can't believe it.

1324
01:17:53,110 --> 01:17:53,780
Hey!

1325
01:17:54,350 --> 01:17:55,680
Yeah, you!

1326
01:17:55,830 --> 01:17:56,980
You bastard!

1327
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:00,680
Do you realize who you just ate, do you?

1328
01:18:01,230 --> 01:18:03,280
Probably the most brilliant man ever.

1329
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:05,320
Probably the only man who ever really knew you.

1330
01:18:05,970 --> 01:18:09,620
Alright, so he was wrong about the size of your brain but you don't go and eat a man for that,

1331
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:11,570
you reason with him you stupid idiot!

1332
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:14,010
He was your future!

1333
01:18:14,830 --> 01:18:16,110
He was my future!

1334
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,360
And I'm never going to get a chance to tell him that because of you!

1335
01:18:29,620 --> 01:18:31,330
It's cool, it's cool!

1336
01:18:36,660 --> 01:18:37,550
Right!

1337
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:39,880
Now we must get home, we're gonna get  ack,

1338
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:42,640
and we're gonna tell the world what Rick Marshall did here today.

1339
01:19:03,330 --> 01:19:05,330
Come on you big green bastards!

1340
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:14,270
I am sick and tired of you slow moving little wankers!

1341
01:19:21,390 --> 01:19:22,330
Will!

1342
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:26,470
Alright little dude, let's do this.

1343
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,350
Lock and load!

1344
01:19:35,910 --> 01:19:36,800
Want some of this?

1345
01:19:37,180 --> 01:19:38,660
Eat Chaka! Eat!

1346
01:19:40,870 --> 01:19:41,530
Will!

1347
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:47,340
Step, step and lift!

1348
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:54,680
Alright my murderous friend take us home.

1349
01:19:59,940 --> 01:20:01,540
Bite that guy right there!

1350
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:05,260
That's him...

1351
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:06,520
That's him!

1352
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:12,260
Oh god that's the coolest thing I've ever seen.

1353
01:20:15,970 --> 01:20:19,170
Would it be cool if he slides down Grumpy's tail just like Fred Flinstone would do-

1354
01:20:23,090 --> 01:20:24,680
Oh god, I've lived.

1355
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:26,160
I have lived.

1356
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:30,110
Come on it tickles.

1357
01:20:30,290 --> 01:20:31,210
Marshall!

1358
01:20:35,890 --> 01:20:36,560
What happened?

1359
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:37,680
We thought you had died.

1360
01:20:38,350 --> 01:20:39,120
Died?

1361
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:41,880
That was just a minor set back.

1362
01:20:43,730 --> 01:20:44,670
Okay let's go home.

1363
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,410
No, this is insane we saw you go down Grumpy's cake hole.

1364
01:20:49,410 --> 01:20:50,710
What did he puke you out or something?

1365
01:20:51,140 --> 01:20:53,460
No, its not possible the...the T-Rex's lacking-

1366
01:20:53,460 --> 01:20:54,610
Not important right now.

1367
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:58,930
I'm okay, and that's it.

1368
01:20:59,310 --> 01:21:00,520
This is messed up.

1369
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:02,270
Look I'd really rather not talk about it.

1370
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:05,610
Now...

1371
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:07,170
Let's light this candle.

1372
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,320
No, Marshall...how did you get out?

1373
01:21:09,630 --> 01:21:11,280
I will talk to you about it later!

1374
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:14,440
Individually to each one of you, I'll explain it.

1375
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,330
Oh geez...

1376
01:21:18,590 --> 01:21:19,750
Would you grow up?

1377
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:21,800
Oh my God!

1378
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:22,890
Yes, he pooped me out!

1379
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:25,530
Now you guys are friends?

1380
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:31,780
Well, I was making my way through his bowels
I must've dislodged some intestinal blockage,

1381
01:21:32,050 --> 01:21:33,720
and yes he's in a much better mood now.

1382
01:21:34,420 --> 01:21:36,500
So, can we move on?

1383
01:21:36,690 --> 01:21:37,880
I really would like to go home.

1384
01:21:38,830 --> 01:21:42,890
You were dueced out by a Dinosaur, that is incredibly cool.

1385
01:21:45,410 --> 01:21:47,760
Grumpy listen...

1386
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:50,860
When you talk about this, and you will...

1387
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:56,800
Please be gentle...okay?

1388
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:00,240
That makes us best buds now.

1389
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:07,080
Don't worry about it, it's hard with your visidual arm.

1390
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:10,080
Let's go guys.

1391
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:11,400
To freedom!

1392
01:22:22,340 --> 01:22:23,900
Thank you Dr. Marshall.

1393
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:28,160
And now the doorway opens.

1394
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:31,500
Enik!

1395
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:33,090
It's over.

1396
01:22:33,730 --> 01:22:34,850
You're not going anywhere.

1397
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:3 ,660
You think you can challenge me?!

1398
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:46,650
I wrestled at Purdue!

1399
01:22:47,910 --> 01:22:48,980
JV!

1400
01:22:50,990 --> 01:22:52,290
Fight! Fight! Fight!

1401
01:22:54,590 --> 01:22:55,210
Chaka!

1402
01:22:55,590 --> 01:22:57,150
Get ready for the ball breaker!

1403
01:22:59,900 --> 01:23:01,920
Marshall, I'm coming in!

1404
01:23:03,890 --> 01:23:05,770
Oh! Misfire!

1405
01:23:23,270 --> 01:23:24,290
What have you done?!

1406
01:23:24,870 --> 01:23:25,930
The door!

1407
01:23:26,630 --> 01:23:27,890
It's closing forever!

1408
01:23:41,540 --> 01:23:42,860
It's barely holding!

1409
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:43,620
Let's go!

1410
01:23:47,180 --> 01:23:48,000
Ha!

1411
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:52,180
It's your home, or your comrade Dr. Marshall!

1412
01:23:53,010 --> 01:23:54,180
No it isn't!

1413
01:23:54,470 --> 01:23:55,260
Reverse!

1414
01:23:56,350 --> 01:23:57,250
You go!

1415
01:23:57,430 --> 01:24:00,710
I've got this yellow bastard on lockdown, I'm gonna stay!

1416
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:01,640
What?!

1417
01:24:02,030 --> 01:24:02,610
Yeah!

1418
01:24:02,910 --> 01:24:04,390
I've been talking to my man Chaka!

1419
01:24:04,390 --> 01:24:05,820
He pitches a pretty good world!

1420
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:07,630
I mean think about it.

1421
01:24:07,990 --> 01:24:09,600
My home was never in the real world?

1422
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,670
Never belonged.

1423
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:12,280
This could be a fresh start for me.

1424
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:14,790
Make some new friends? I could be somebody!

1425
01:24:15,150 --> 01:24:15,850
A winner...

1426
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:19,550
Wow, I really admire you right now.

1427
01:24:19,740 --> 01:24:23,590
I just feel like so many people go through this life
looking for what I've found here, you know?

1428
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:25,460
And they themselves, can never find it.

1429
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:27,150
Or worse.

1430
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:30,030
They find it, and let it slip away.

1431
01:24:31,580 --> 01:24:33,340
I am so afraid of that happening.

1432
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:35,240
You wouldn't be human if you didn't feel scared.

1433
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:36,570
Marshall!

1434
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:39,780
Please, you can't leave me here like this with him.

1435
01:24:40,510 --> 01:24:43,360
As one scientist to another, I beg you for mercy!

1436
01:24:45,570 --> 01:24:46,960
Science shows no mercy.

1437
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:48,580
And neither do I.

1438
01:24:49,310 --> 01:24:50,100
That's good.

1439
01:24:51,630 --> 01:24:52,490
Let's go Holly.

1440
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:57,200
Ready?

1441
01:24:57,930 --> 01:24:58,510
Ready...

1442
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:02,060
Chaka! Technically I'm still your master!

1443
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:15,520
Marshall?

1444
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:16,640
Holly?

1445
01:25:21,570 --> 01:25:22,920
We made it!

1446
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:33,440
I just want to say...

1447
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:37,410
You have grown into a beautiful woman.

1448
01:25:51,350 --> 01:25:52,260
Hey!

1449
01:25:54,290 --> 01:25:55,400
Where's Will?

1450
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,360
He went to a better place.

1451
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:02,010
You killed him?

1452
01:26:02,950 --> 01:26:03,740
No...

1453
01:26:05,180 --> 01:26:08,080
No he went to a strange world.

1454
01:26:09,410 --> 01:26:13,810
A world of Dinosaurs, monkey people, lizard people.

1455
01:26:14,970 --> 01:26:17,410
A whole in space and time, a virtual...

1456
01:26:18,050 --> 01:26:19,210
Land of the lost.

1457
01:26:20,930 --> 01:26:24,490
As hard as it is to believe, Will chose to stay.

1458
01:26:25,930 --> 01:26:27,490
Alright, cool.

1459
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:32,500
Did you see the Sleestaks beat the crap out of Enik?

1460
01:26:33,19  --> 01:26:34,780
I've never seen them move so fast.

1461
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:38,120
Couldn't agree more little buddy.

1462
01:26:38,450 --> 01:26:39,500
Tunic...

1463
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:42,960
I got you come on.

1464
01:26:46,770 --> 01:26:48,260
You are deceptively heavy.

1465
01:27:06,580 --> 01:27:08,490
I'm a pina kusa!

1466
01:27:13,730 --> 01:27:14,630
Chaka!

1467
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:17,290
God, we're kings!

1468
01:27:23,180 --> 01:27:24,450
That's what your women look like?

1469
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:25,980
Hop off, be cool.

1470
01:27:28,820 --> 01:27:31,220
Whoa easy, stand down!

1471
01:27:31,860 --> 01:27:32,980
I got this.

1472
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:37,480
How's it going? I'm Will, pretty much Chaka's best friend.

1473
01:27:37,980 --> 01:27:41,450
I'm here to offer you all protection and shelter.

1474
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:46,060
And really pretty much anything that you guys would ever need.

1475
01:27:47,290 --> 01:27:48,240
Hey, how's it going?

1476
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:50,520
Yeah that's denim.

1477
01:27:50,950 --> 01:27:51,570
Denim.

1478
01:27:52,430 --> 01:27:53,950
Yeah...yeah.

1479
01:27:56,460 --> 01:27:57,960
This was definitely a good choice.

1480
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:03,800
This is TODAY with Matt Lauer.

1481
01:28:04,470 --> 01:28:09,030
It's been sometime since my final guest was here but after the,

1482
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:13,230
remarkable events of the passed year, he needs no introduction.

1483
01:28:13,530 --> 01:28:18,960
He's back with a new book, and more startling evidence
of you guessed it, Time Warps.

1484
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:19,840
The pipe's allowed.

1485
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:20,620
I asked.

1486
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:22,270
That's great news.

1487
01:28:22,950 --> 01:28:25,150
You've had, quite a year.

1488
01:28:25,150 --> 01:28:26,930
Actually stellar year, Matt.

01:28:27,250 --> 01:28:28,930
In fact I brought you back a Dinosaur egg.

1490
01:28:29,180 --> 01:28:34,810
Which my beautiful partner, and lover Holly Cantrell was gracious enough to transport.

1491
01:28:34,810 --> 01:28:37,130
And I'm obviously very excited about my new tome...

1492
01:28:37,130 --> 01:28:37,910
It's a book.

1493
01:28:37,910 --> 01:28:40,020
Sixteen weeks on the NY Time's best seller list.

1494
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:41,840
Let me get to your discovery doctor because this is-

1495
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:42,300
This is for you.

1496
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:43,260
I signed it.

1497
01:28:47,260 --> 01:28:48,870
You're supposed to say the title and the publisher.

1498
01:28:48,870 --> 01:28:49,930
That's not gonna happen.

1499
01:28:50,430 --> 01:28:51,070
Just say it.

1500
01:28:51,070 --> 01:28:51,640
No!

1501
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:52,830
Just say the damn title.

1502
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:54,060
Fine.

1503
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:57,900
Matt Lauer can suck it, by Dr. Rick Marshall.

1504
01:28:58,130 --> 01:29:00,700
I was so surprised that your attorney signed off on that,

1505
01:29:00,700 --> 01:29:02,440
I was like, are you sure? Is this gonna be okay?

1506
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:03,380
He said yeah, go for it.

1507
01:29:03,690 --> 01:29:04,690
