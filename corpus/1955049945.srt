2
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:47,706
It doesn't make sense, I don't

3
00:00:47,732 --> 00:00:50,160
understand how something
like this happened.

4
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,780
I don't know what
I'm going to do.

5
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,715
This has been my whole life,
and now it's gone

6
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:58,048
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

7
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:01,934
Pendleton Industries is
all I've ever known,

8
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:03,776
and now it's all
been taken away.

9
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,692
<i>When someone sees a
weakness in me,

10
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,298
<i>I turn that weakness
into</i> a strength.

11
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:18,286
Danica, you're so strong.

12
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,746
I don't think I can
do anything like this.

13
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:25,468
You can imagine
changing your life

14
00:01:25,568 --> 00:01:28,219
by fighting for the
deed to the land, Clarinda.

15
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:32,228
Which is possible only if
Bartholomew is no longer living.

16
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:38,687
You will never get the
deed to the land again,

17
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,264
I will never allow it.

18
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:42,845
Put down that gun,
you silly girl.

19
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,676
Watch your step, Bartholomew,

20
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:48,107
Ridge is on the way,

21
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:50,184
and he's still in
love with Clarinda.

22
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:53,159
And Jared loves me.

23
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:56,485
Clarinda, it's true.

24
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,233
I'm here for you.

25
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:15,254
<i>This is the story of Joy,

26
00:02:15,304 --> 00:02:20,035
<i>as told by me,
her grandmother.

27
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:28,110
<i>Everybody starts with a some
kind of dream of what life will be.

28
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:37,046
<i>Joy dreams started at this
metal garage her father ran.

29
00:02:49,573 --> 00:02:53,774
<i>My granddaughter had a
best friend, Jackie...

30
00:03:00,368 --> 00:03:03,323
<i>a half-sister, Peggy...

31
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,650
<i>a dog...

32
00:03:08,824 --> 00:03:10,924
<i>a father...

33
00:03:12,787 --> 00:03:15,007
<i>a mother...

34
00:03:16,904 --> 00:03:19,429
<i>who is my daughter...

35
00:03:20,018 --> 00:03:22,931
<i>a grandmother, that's me.

36
00:03:35,476 --> 00:03:40,466
<i>She made many beautiful
things in hers world, magic.

37
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:44,508
<i>Some people love
to make things.

38
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:49,732
<i>They have the patience and the focus
to figure it out with their hands.

39
00:03:50,122 --> 00:03:54,147
<i>Joy was one of those people
who rejoiced in making things.

40
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:58,394
And I open the door to
the big green meadow.

41
00:03:58,768 --> 00:04:01,214
And I go into the forest.

42
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,553
And there I conquered
many dangers:

43
00:04:06,132 --> 00:04:08,985
A wolf and other
scary things.

44
00:04:09,387 --> 00:04:12,847
And I started to build
my very own house,

45
00:04:13,317 --> 00:04:17,821
where I would live and make wonderful
creations for everyone else,

46
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,981
to see and have.

47
00:04:20,181 --> 00:04:23,754
Maybe for the Prince and Princess who
lived across the forest in a castle.

48
00:04:24,608 --> 00:04:28,337
See? And they were in love.

49
00:04:28,462 --> 00:04:31,976
Maybe they'd invite me over
because of the things that I made.

50
00:04:32,989 --> 00:04:36,712
<i>You need a handsome prince,
that's what you need: a prince.

51
00:04:38,562 --> 00:04:43,772
No, I don't need a prince, this is a
special power, I don't need a prince.

52
00:04:46,492 --> 00:04:49,143
<i>My daughter Terry is separated

53
00:04:49,343 --> 00:04:51,694
<i>and alone in her room
watching soap operas.

54
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:53,655
<i>You can imagine changing your life

55
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:56,783
<i>by fighting for the
deed to the land, Clarinda.

56
00:04:57,413 --> 00:05:03,527
- I have something for you.
- Oh, Danica, you're so strong,

57
00:05:03,652 --> 00:05:06,397
I don't think I can ever
do something like this.

58
00:05:10,436 --> 00:05:14,479
<i>I always felt it was
for me to encourage her,

59
00:05:14,653 --> 00:05:16,696
<i>So I said:

60
00:05:16,821 --> 00:05:21,674
You are going to grow up and be
a strong, smart, young woman,

61
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:27,175
go to school, meet a fine, young man,
have beautiful children of your own,

62
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:33,083
and you're gonna build wonderful
things that you do in your room.

63
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:33,838
Okay?

64
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:37,010
<i>What happened to
this girl's dreams?

65
00:05:37,822 --> 00:05:38,739
<i>Watch this...

66
00:05:38,929 --> 00:05:41,243
Mother,
I can't find my lanyard for work,

67
00:05:41,273 --> 00:05:43,428
they're not gonna let me through
airport security without it.

68
00:05:43,517 --> 00:05:45,201
Joy, can't find your lanyard?

69
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:46,905
- Can I help you?
- No but I...

70
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:48,071
Honey, listen,

71
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:52,849
I know life hasn't gone as we
discussed many times, Sweetheart,

72
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:54,943
and you don't exactly have
your WHOLE life ahead of you,

73
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:59,084
but you still have
a good portion of it anyway.

74
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:02,151
"Hope springs eternal."

75
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,060
- Thanks, Mimi.
- Sure.

76
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:07,224
Mother, look what I DID find.

77
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,227
What is that?

78
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:12,202
How can you ask what this is?

79
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:15,073
It's the dog collar I
invented in high school.

80
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:16,605
Remember Mitzi choked
a couple of times

81
00:06:16,805 --> 00:06:18,405
and so I invented
the dog collar

82
00:06:18,429 --> 00:06:20,976
with a quick release so
a dog would never choke

83
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,048
and I covered it
with reflective tape...

84
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:24,276
PLUS, it's a flea collar.

85
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:27,186
I probably wouldn't be
late to this job I'm going to

86
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:29,187
if you had gotten me
a patent or a lawyer.

87
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,091
Joy the Doer, Joy the Doer,
you were always doing things, Honey.

88
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:34,592
How can I be expected
to remember everything?

89
00:06:34,642 --> 00:06:37,286
<i>Now the Hartz Company
has a patent to that collar.

90
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:39,407
I don't know how
to get a patent.

91
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,497
What's that smell?

92
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,933
Ow, how did you get yogurt down here,
Mother?

93
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:47,883
<i>I was wondering
what that odor was.

94
00:06:47,933 --> 00:06:49,778
It's starting to mold,
for Pete's sake.

95
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:54,136
Yes, I am, because I feel like I can
NOT have the life bled out of me this way.

96
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,638
Joy, look who's back,
look who's back!

97
00:06:57,151 --> 00:07:00,416
- Yes, Bartholomew is back!
<i>- No no.

98
00:07:00,466 --> 00:07:01,834
I thought Bartholomew was dead.

99
00:07:01,884 --> 00:07:02,728
<i>I am a ghost.

100
00:07:02,778 --> 00:07:05,019
He came back as a ghost
with even greater powers.

101
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:08,395
<i>- Ghost, you go away!
- My powers are even greater now.

102
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,287
<i>I cannot handle this,
how is it possible?

103
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,626
<i>- I will always...
- Stay away from them!

104
00:07:11,694 --> 00:07:13,903
<i>Clarinda, you don't know
what a ghost can do to you!

105
00:07:13,953 --> 00:07:15,543
<i>...even from beyond the grave.

106
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,162
Grandma's gonna  take you to the
birthday party, okay. 5 minutes?

107
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:25,646
- Hi, what are you doin' here?
- I'm returning him to you.

108
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:28,178
- I don't want him anymore.
- WHAT?

109
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:31,342
He's damaged,
he has no place else to go.

110
00:07:31,392 --> 00:07:33,285
He's been livin'
in my house for two years.

111
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,189
- Oh, Dad, I'm so sorry.
- Yeah...

112
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:37,765
But, ya know,
Tony's livin' in the basement.

113
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,215
Your ex-husband shouldn't be livin'
in your basement,

114
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,251
that's not the proper
way to be divorced.

115
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,626
Okay, I don't know where
I'm gonna put you.

116
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,544
<i>Dad, don't go in there,
Mom's in there.

117
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:51,203
<i>You can have him back, Terry,
I don't want him anymore.

118
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:53,104
What's so much better
in being with Sharon?

119
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:53,997
Dad, don't answer that.

120
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:56,198
We went to the Metropolitan
Museum of Art...

121
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,107
<i>- What did you like at the museum?
- What did I like?

122
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,150
<i>I'll tell you what I liked:

123
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,186
I like the ancient Roman statues,
I liked the medieval armor,

124
00:08:03,236 --> 00:08:04,989
I liked the Etruscan jewelry...

125
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:07,332
Museums are full
dust and death.

126
00:08:07,382 --> 00:08:09,516
- having an espresso, a nice Panini...
<i>- Okay, okay, enough.

127
00:08:09,566 --> 00:08:12,156
<i>- That's what I like.
- You ate a Panini</i> in a coffin, Rudy,

128
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:13,983
A dusty, boring coffin.

129
00:08:14,096 --> 00:08:16,205
Then why did you ask me,
what, are you a crazy person?

130
00:08:16,255 --> 00:08:17,716
It's like having a conversation

131
00:08:17,766 --> 00:08:18,959
- with an insane asylum person.
- What else, Captain Jack?

132
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:19,998
What else was so great?

133
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,033
- Captain Jack?
- Yes, you're Captain Jack, the Flying Jackass.

134
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:24,360
And do you know what you are?
You're like a gas leak.

135
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,742
- We don't smell you, we don't see you,
- I'm not a gas leak.

136
00:08:26,792 --> 00:08:28,037
- But you're killing us all... silently.
- Retract that!

137
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:29,094
Tell me what else
you did with Sharon!

138
00:08:29,118 --> 00:08:31,075
You Creature from the Black Lagoon.

139
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,944
No! This conversation is over!

140
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:36,179
<i>Oh, my god, here it goes,
watch out, Joy,</i> he's gonna snap!

141
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:38,537
Aw, please, you want me to snap,
that's your whole routine.

142
00:08:38,587 --> 00:08:39,873
<i>- You want to...
- Do I have a vagina?

143
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,053
<i>- Hey, Terry!
- Stop.

144
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,179
<i>- Like this?
- Dad, no!

145
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,497
<i>How's this for snapping?

146
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:45,941
- NO!
- How this?

147
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,841
<i>- This is snapping.
- Dad!

148
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,127
<i>- Okay?
- You're disturbed!

149
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:52,614
You're a disturbed man!

150
00:08:52,664 --> 00:08:54,120
- I'm disturbed!
- He's a damaged man!

151
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:57,353
You're right, I AM disturbed!
You're The Great Disturber!

152
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:00,904
I'm sorry, Honey,
I don't like this.

153
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,302
You're not supposed to see this
kind of thing, I'm very, very sorry,

154
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:06,903
<i>- I apologize sincerely...
- It's not gonna happen, okay?

155
00:09:06,953 --> 00:09:08,376
<i>We got other investors.

156
00:09:08,426 --> 00:09:11,405
- Okay, I'm gonna clean all this up.
- Dad, no, don't clean it up.

157
00:09:11,455 --> 00:09:13,834
Dad, stop! Just don't! Okay?

158
00:09:13,884 --> 00:09:14,701
<i>What do you say?

159
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,389
Stop! I'll do it!
I just wanna get you out of this room.

160
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:20,793
Thank you.

161
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,780
Hi, Guys,
I'm sorry about all the yelling.

162
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:24,944
Mimi's gonna take you
to the birthday party, okay?

163
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:26,601
Hi, My Sweethearts.

164
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,283
- You broke things again.
-  He did.

165
00:09:28,305 --> 00:09:30,328
I did, I did brake some things,
but Grandma was WRONG,

166
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:33,100
so, I was a LITTLE wrong,
but she was REALLY wrong.

167
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:34,997
But Grandpa's gonna come stay
with us for a little while.

168
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:36,285
- Yea!
<i>- Yea!

169
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:39,015
A sleepover with Grandpa! Yea!

170
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:43,137
Sharon never separated the wash,
the whites were always gray.

171
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:45,152
- But you have that magic touch, Sweetheart.
- Yea.

172
00:09:45,202 --> 00:09:46,985
- Can I give this to you?
- Yea, I'll take care of it, yea.

173
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,359
- Gotcha back.
- You can put 'em on my ledgers

174
00:09:48,409 --> 00:09:50,848
- and all that stuff, the accounting...
- I know, I'll get them to you later, Dad.

175
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,439
- Love you, Grandpa.
<i>- Love you.

176
00:09:52,528 --> 00:09:54,544
<i>I did your taxes, there's your W-2's.

177
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,303
You suck!

178
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,985
- What is he doing here?
- Sharon brought him back.

179
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:16,629
So, he's gonna stay with us
until he finds a new love or...

180
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:19,379
a new place to live.
You know how this goes.

181
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:21,594
Joy, I can't have your father here.

182
00:10:21,644 --> 00:10:24,303
What do you wanna want me to do,
Tony, I have to work.

183
00:10:24,353 --> 00:10:27,300
I know, Sweetheart, but your father's a nightmare,
we're gonna kill him... I can't...

184
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,524
I can't take it anymore, NITWIT!
That's the end of it!

185
00:10:29,574 --> 00:10:30,459
Dad! Up!

186
00:10:30,509 --> 00:10:33,657
I will KILL myself! I don't like any
of this! I don't like this!

187
00:10:33,707 --> 00:10:35,851
This is not the proper way to be divorced,
the two of you.

188
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:37,635
You're gonna tell me
how to be divorced?

189
00:10:37,659 --> 00:10:38,834
I'm a provider, Tom Jones,

190
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:41,607
I have my own business, I help Joy
with the mortgage. What are you doing?

191
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,811
You sing all night at
Angela Starpoli's club,

192
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,168
You get repeatedly fired
from Campbell's Soup...

193
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,579
Okay, well,
I'm gonna divide the basement.

194
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:50,355
I'm divorced,
I can do whatever I want, Rudy.

195
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:51,865
<i>This is not the proper way
to be divorced.

196
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:54,177
I'll am about to be late for work,
so please,

197
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,188
try not to fight in front
children, okay?

198
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:57,474
Especially not physically.

199
00:10:57,524 --> 00:11:00,279
Rudy, do you see this?
This microphone here?

200
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,626
You touch it, and I kill you.

201
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:08,891
I'm leaving, please, try not to
kill each of while I'm gone.

202
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:10,672
<i>You've gone mad,
this is all YOUR fault!

203
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:12,163
<i>Clarinda, Clarinda!

204
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,002
<i>- Don't.!
- Clarinda.

205
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:16,387
<i>Something terrible happened!
Stay away from him!

206
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:22,565
Oh, God, I have to fix this.

207
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:25,463
<i>- Nice job, Joy, nice job.</i>
- Peggy?

208
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:27,463
What are you doing here?

209
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:30,326
What's the matter with
you sending Grandma Mimi

210
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:33,190
and her arthritis to take them
to their friend's birthday?

211
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm fine!

212
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:37,568
<i>You had a much better time with
me anyway, with Aunt Peggy.

213
00:11:37,618 --> 00:11:42,116
<i>Uh-uh! But I wasn't stupid enough to get into
a bad marriage and have a couple of kids.

214
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:43,265
<i>Don't bother your sister.

215
00:11:43,315 --> 00:11:46,049
I'm here to talk to Dad about business.
All right?

216
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:48,025
You gonna come bring the
books by the garage later?

217
00:11:48,098 --> 00:11:48,874
Yeah, I'm gonna bring 'em later.

218
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:50,484
- He's in the basement.
- I know that you're here, I'm joking.

219
00:11:50,572 --> 00:11:51,815
Yeah, I know.

220
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,317
Kids, we're gonna do
somethin' fun later, okay?

221
00:11:54,367 --> 00:11:55,980
<i>We're doin' somethin' fun now.

222
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:05,114
<i>Well, we found your luggage,
but it's in Cleveland,

223
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,125
<i>So now we just need to get
it back to New York City.

224
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,185
<i>I'm filing a complaint.

225
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:11,224
My husband needs
his medication.

226
00:12:11,274 --> 00:12:13,307
What's your name? Joy?

227
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:17,018
- You don't seem joyous today.
- Perhaps I'm not so joyous today.

228
00:12:17,068 --> 00:12:18,623
Joy, I think you're being too hard.

229
00:12:18,647 --> 00:12:21,071
Listen,
I need you to speak to your supervisor.

230
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:24,908
We're gonna be having some changes, and
you're going to be going to the night hours.

231
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,044
- Night? I was still making...
- We're having cutbacks.

232
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,660
- Joy, I'm sorry.
- Goodbye, nice to meet you.

233
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:53,836
<i>I'm not payin'
for metal that I haven't gotten.

234
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:55,646
<i>And on top of me, he says,
ya know, he wants to get paid,

235
00:12:55,696 --> 00:12:58,174
<i>he doesn't send an invoice and
he hasn't even sent the metal.

236
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:01,926
Why doesn't he just send the invoice?
Send the invoice, I'll pay him.

237
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:05,175
Yeah, that's it,
send the invoice.

238
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:09,179
Hi, Dad, I want to thank you again
for helping with the mortgage.

239
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,945
- It's okay.
- I, um...

240
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,918
- settled accounts, balanced the books.
- Thank you.

241
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:18,142
I'm sorry business is so bad, Dad, but I don't
think that crazy gun range is helping.

242
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,355
How is that still legal?

243
00:13:20,428 --> 00:13:21,952
- What can I do?
- After all these years.

244
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:26,185
I mean, they keep to themselves, it's
their property, the police leave 'em alone.

245
00:13:26,235 --> 00:13:30,095
- Why, you think it's costing us business?
- I don't think it's helping.

246
00:13:30,385 --> 00:13:33,141
Well, if you want to help, why don't you
come here and manage this place?

247
00:13:33,191 --> 00:13:34,656
Ya know, I'd like to go to the next level,

248
00:13:34,732 --> 00:13:37,762
put on a nice suit, ya know,
go out there and get some accounts.

249
00:13:39,549 --> 00:13:44,840
- Yeah, this is 9873, just checking my mailbox.
- What is that?

250
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,654
Yeah, I have a pen,
what is it?

251
00:13:46,704 --> 00:13:49,870
13, 14, that's it? Thank you.

252
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:51,505
What was that?

253
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:55,788
- It's a... 900 number.
- What's a 900 number?

254
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:59,959
It's a, ya know, a dating service for...
widows and widowers.

255
00:14:00,009 --> 00:14:01,485
A dating service?

256
00:14:01,535 --> 00:14:04,373
- You're not a widow or a widower.
<i>- What's the difference, I'm single.

257
00:14:04,423 --> 00:14:07,194
I meet nice ladies,
maybe we fall in love.

258
00:14:07,244 --> 00:14:09,757
I have to fall in love or I'm
not interested, you know me.

259
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,077
I know, Dad.

260
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:16,161
Joan was no good for him, it's nice to have to
need somebody new, I got him some new clothes.

261
00:14:16,211 --> 00:14:19,254
- Okay, okay, sounds good.
<i>- Hello, is this 7633?

262
00:14:19,304 --> 00:14:20,497
- I'll be seeing you.
<i>- Yes.

263
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,553
- G'bye.
- Hi, this is 9833.

264
00:14:23,603 --> 00:14:27,535
- Oh! Hi! How... How are you?
- What a nice voice you have.

265
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,710
<i>- Thank you.
- You have an accent.

266
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,608
- Oh, yes, I am from Italy.
<i>- Oh, continental.

267
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:38,414
<i>- What is your name?</i>
- My name is Rudy, what's yours?

268
00:14:38,464 --> 00:14:39,531
Trudy.

269
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,738
- Are you kidding?
<i>- No.

270
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:43,829
- Your name is Trudy?
- Yes.

271
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:48,300
Rudy and Trudy, I love it.
Let's figure out when we're gonna meet.

272
00:14:48,353 --> 00:14:50,246
<i>That's a good idea,
let's have dinner.

273
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,182
<i>I can come pick you up.

274
00:14:52,232 --> 00:14:55,910
- I have a green Mercedes.
<i>- Okay, 6:30, I'll be ready.

275
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,033
Ciao!

276
00:14:58,164 --> 00:15:00,966
- Good luck with your date, Dad.
<i>- Thank you, I'm excited.

277
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,433
What do you think
you're gonna wear?

278
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,351
Polo by Ralph Lauren.

279
00:15:06,401 --> 00:15:08,544
Do you have to use a
whole bottle of cologne?

280
00:15:08,594 --> 00:15:10,003
<i>- Tony!</i>
- You smell like my grandmother.

281
00:15:10,053 --> 00:15:11,041
He smells like my grandmother.

282
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:13,872
Hey, please, don't make me tense,
don't stress me out.

283
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,705
- Gotta stay nice and loose.
<i>- Are you tense?

284
00:15:16,755 --> 00:15:18,583
<i>- I'm tense, you're makin' me tense.</i>
- Dad, stop!

285
00:15:18,633 --> 00:15:20,055
<i>- I'm making you tense?</i>
- Please.

286
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,012
- My carriage awaits.
- Have a great date.

287
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,291
- Wish me luck.
- You don't need it.

288
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:29,295
- Joy, water!
<i>- Where are my cufflinks?

289
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,048
Mommy, come read to me!

290
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,944
Five minutes, Chris.
Mother AGAIN?

291
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,514
Yeah, just sit right there.

292
00:15:36,564 --> 00:15:40,204
Are you comfortable?
How many times do I have to tell you

293
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:43,140
not to clean the
brushes out in the sink!

294
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:46,953
Danica thinks it's un-ladylike to toss
things in the toilet and I happen to agree.

295
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,531
Yeah? Well, better you have
Danica do your plumbing then, huh?

296
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:53,177
<i>Danica directs her power
anywhere Danica chooses.

297
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:55,682
<i>That's the power of Danica.

298
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:05,106
Oh, God, if this problem gets any worse, we're
gonna have to move you into a different room.

299
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:08,901
That means no TV.
it can be very scary for you.

300
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:13,101
Oh, don't let that happen,
Joy, this is my comfort nest.

301
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:17,400
- We're gonna need to get a plumber in here.
- What?

302
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:20,703
There's... a man in... in my room?

303
00:16:20,753 --> 00:16:23,374
Well, I don't know any female
plumbers other than me.

304
00:16:23,424 --> 00:16:27,384
- Well, can't you fix it, Joy?
- This has surpassed my capabilities.

305
00:16:27,434 --> 00:16:28,770
Thanks, Joy.

306
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:32,484
The cicada's a large, flying insects
two to three inches long,

307
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:36,515
and makes a sound of up to 120 decibels,
louder than some telephones.

308
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:40,102
It lives half its life above
ground evading predators.

309
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,146
This is the book you wanted me to read to you,
Christie Anna? This book didn't get into the house?

310
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:48,254
Aunt Peggy got it for me,
she says that the reason I like cicadas,

311
00:16:48,304 --> 00:16:50,671
is because they fill
the air with sound,

312
00:16:50,871 --> 00:16:53,027
which makes the house
less lonelier for me.

313
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:56,714
Aunt Peggy tells how YOU
feel about the house being lonely?

314
00:16:56,843 --> 00:17:01,051
Aunt Peggy tells me a lot of things,
keep reading, please.

315
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,947
I don't want you listening
to Aunt Peggy too much.

316
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,485
Okay, why?

317
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,254
The cicada, a symbol of
rebirth in many countries,

318
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:13,043
digs into the ground and stays
buried for up to 17 years.

319
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,506
That's such a random number,
why 17 years?

320
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:21,878
It doesn't even say why,
I understand the four seasons in a year.

321
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:26,182
Why would something stay hidden for 17 years,
that's just unsettling.

322
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:29,549
I'm not reading this,
you're sleepy anyway, we gotta go to bed.

323
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:34,211
- I wanna sleep with Nana.
- No, you should sleep upstairs in your room.

324
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:36,312
I want Nana.

325
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:39,320
Anyway, wanna watch out,
there's a hole.

326
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,431
Good night.

327
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:49,171
- Just gonna lay down for a second.
<i>- ...this is on you!

328
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:54,366
You knew that Bartholomew
is the ex-con in the story,

329
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,877
and Clarinda doesn't
even know about it.

330
00:17:57,127 --> 00:17:58,940
<i>Danica's on to him.

331
00:17:59,961 --> 00:18:03,003
<i>They all blame Clarinda but Danica's
gonna get to the bottom of it.

332
00:18:03,353 --> 00:18:06,401
- No!
- Yes! It WAS you, Clarinda.

333
00:18:06,451 --> 00:18:09,948
- I will get to the bottom of this.
- You've made TERRIBLE mistakes.

334
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,210
It was Clarinda!

335
00:18:14,435 --> 00:18:15,136
Oh.

336
00:18:15,186 --> 00:18:17,632
- Look who's here.
- Look who's here.

337
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,148
<i>Look who's here.

338
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:47,420
We are here today to remember what was
lost, 17 years ago, can you remember?

339
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:53,454
Peggy comes with me,
Joy spends half the time with us.

340
00:18:54,537 --> 00:18:55,356
We'll take her paper...

341
00:18:55,433 --> 00:18:58,572
That's Joy's specialty
and it belongs in this house.

342
00:18:58,622 --> 00:19:00,622
No, I...

343
00:19:11,673 --> 00:19:12,884
<i>Joy...

344
00:19:14,508 --> 00:19:18,349
<i>Joy, wake up,
someone's been ringing the door bell.

345
00:19:22,753 --> 00:19:24,796
<i>None of you really
knows what's going on.

346
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:28,157
<i>- But I do.
- Don't you talk to Danica that way.

347
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,296
Jackie.

348
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:37,201
- Oh, my God, what happened?
- I'm worried about you.

349
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:40,268
I don't see you anymore,
you don't come to the PTA.

350
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:44,654
You know how my mom is always clogging
the sink with her hair from the brushes?

351
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,266
- Are the pipes in her room?
- Yeah.

352
00:19:47,316 --> 00:19:49,113
- She did it again.
- Again?

353
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,466
Yes, and I had to bash
open a hole in the floor,

354
00:19:51,516 --> 00:19:54,182
there is a huge hole in the
floor of my mother's room.

355
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,127
and I'm broke.

356
00:19:57,162 --> 00:20:01,038
My father works hard,
he's had some bad breaks.

357
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,796
I hope he gets another girlfriend,
and'll move out of the basement.

358
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,385
- He's in the basement with Tony?
- Yeah.

359
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,211
- And they hate each other.
- Yes.

360
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:16,562
It's a disaster,
they won't stop fighting.

361
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,302
I don't know, I don't know.

362
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:23,059
How are you, how's the family,
how is everybody?

363
00:20:23,452 --> 00:20:25,380
- Everybody's okay.
- How's work?

364
00:20:26,591 --> 00:20:28,848
My job...
I could take it or leave it.

365
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,135
What happened to us, Jackie?

366
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:34,167
All the things we
used to dream about?

367
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:37,418
I feel like things keep getting
farther and farther away.

368
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,669
<i>Do you remember the night at the
party where everything started?

369
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,562
<i>The band was playing,
everyone was excited.

370
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:49,384
How are you?
I need you home so bad.

371
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:51,791
- This is my boyfriend, Andre.
- Hello, Andre.

372
00:20:51,841 --> 00:20:54,287
- A pleasure to meet you.
- Andre, this is my childhood friend, Joy.

373
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:55,619
Come inside!

374
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:58,124
This is my music class.

375
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,595
- This is a CLASS?
- Yes!

376
00:21:00,645 --> 00:21:03,112
♫ Don't turn on the lights,
'cause I don't wanna see. ♫

377
00:21:03,312 --> 00:21:05,988
♫ Mama told me not to come! ♫

378
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:09,524
- They're so good.
- They are, he teaches band.

379
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:28,283
- Who's the bald guy?
- That's my music teacher.

380
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:31,821
<i>- And he has all this music in his house?
- Yeah, this is his house.

381
00:21:31,969 --> 00:21:34,628
- He's from Venezuela.
- Who is that guy?

382
00:21:35,194 --> 00:21:38,038
Yeah, that's the music teacher's son.

383
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:41,280
- My God, my God.
- You see?

384
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,915
You're dancing... here we go.

385
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:47,725
You like dancing?

386
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:51,168
What am I doing?

387
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,102
- You're dancing.
- No.

388
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:55,212
- Let me show you my father's house.
- What?

389
00:21:55,214 --> 00:21:57,114
<i>I'm gonna be a singer.

390
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:59,961
- Really?
- Yeah, I'm gonna be the next Tom Jones.

391
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,309
So, that's a big ambition...
there's only one Tom Jones.

392
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:05,820
I know, but...

393
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:07,896
You can't let the
practical get you down.

394
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,441
You gotta keep doing
to what you love.

395
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:13,093
That's true.

396
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:14,619
That's what my
father taught me.

397
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:19,229
What about you?

398
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:24,111
I invented The Dog Collar.

399
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:27,718
And I want to get patents,
but I don't think I ever will.

400
00:22:29,229 --> 00:22:32,436
I was valedictorian in high school.

401
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:37,220
I got into a college in Boston,
but I...

402
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:40,281
I stayed here because my parents
are getting divorced, and...

403
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,166
I need to help my Mom...

404
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:44,989
and I help my Dad
with business stuff.

405
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:47,129
Accountant.

406
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:50,193
Maybe your dreams are
on hold right now.

407
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:52,093
No?

408
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:54,262
That's a nice way
of putting it.

409
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:58,071
This song,
it's going to be in the town musical.

410
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,304
We should sing it together.

411
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:06,229
♫ I know I stand in line until you think you
have the time to spend an evening with me. ♫

412
00:23:07,286 --> 00:23:08,877
That's really nice.

413
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:10,112
Okay, go.

414
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:11,037
- No!
- Okay...

415
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:16,251
♫ And if we go someplace to dance I know
that there's a chance you won't be... ♫

416
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:19,921
<i>He gave my girl a spring in
her step just when she needed it.

417
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,208
<i>He got her to do the musical.

418
00:23:24,249 --> 00:23:26,262
<i>Something she never woulda done.

419
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:43,970
♫ I know I stand in line until you think you
have the time to spend an evening with me. ♫

420
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:53,615
♫ And if we go someplace to dance I know that
there's a chance you won't be leaving with me. ♫

421
00:23:54,933 --> 00:24:02,301
♫ And afterwards we drop into a quiet
little place and have a drink or two ♫

422
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:06,237
Are you all right, Honey?

423
00:24:13,957 --> 00:24:15,608
...talking to herself... strange.

424
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:19,080
Honey, you should go to bed.

425
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:27,263
- Hi, I'm Toussaint.
<i>- Toussaint? Who's this guy?

426
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:30,358
- Not to me, for you?
- No, it's not for me.

427
00:24:30,408 --> 00:24:32,068
Oh, the plumber.

428
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:33,162
What's he here for?

429
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:36,655
- What do you think? Terry.
- Terry, oh, Terry.

430
00:24:36,705 --> 00:24:38,081
Oh, oh, wait,
what's going on?

431
00:24:38,209 --> 00:24:40,388
What is this MAN
doing in my room?

432
00:24:40,642 --> 00:24:43,697
- This is... Toussaint.
- Toussaint.

433
00:24:44,283 --> 00:24:47,035
- Terry, Toussaint.
- Okay, well.

434
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:52,423
I mean, I... I... I taped my show, and then...
well, exactly how long is this going to take?

435
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,533
Well, it shouldn't take
more than a day.

436
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:59,346
<i>What... what... what accent is that, Joy?</i>
What country is that from?

437
00:24:59,632 --> 00:25:01,292
- Haiti.
- Haiti.

438
00:25:01,342 --> 00:25:04,202
- Haiti.
- It's French and Creole.

439
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:06,409
French and Creole...

440
00:25:06,459 --> 00:25:09,037
Well, is there any way...
could you please put a curtain up here

441
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:12,409
so that I can come and go in my room and
watch my show while he's still working?

442
00:25:12,459 --> 00:25:14,467
<i>Of course, I'll staple it.

443
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,225
- Thank you, Sir.
- You're welcome, Mademoiselle.

444
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:18,955
Mademoiselle?

445
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,278
Good luck in here and...
good luck with that.

446
00:25:24,628 --> 00:25:26,111
<i>Why don't you go to bed.

447
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,972
Go on, keep going up the stairs,
go to bed.

448
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,182
I don't wanna go to sleep,
I don't wanna have that horrible dream.

449
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:36,570
C'mon, you can't have the
same dream twice, it never happens.

450
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,966
- It's impossible.
- That's not true.

451
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:42,977
I had the Peggy dream so many times
when I was younger with masks and rope.

452
00:25:43,027 --> 00:25:44,176
That doesn't make sense, no, no.

453
00:25:44,226 --> 00:25:46,977
You can't have the same dream twice,
maybe it's...

454
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:48,576
<i>Rudy, she's thinking about something.

455
00:25:48,693 --> 00:25:50,970
Maybe it's a kinda dream,
and she's working something out.

456
00:25:51,297 --> 00:25:54,298
I don't WANNA work anything out,
I just want to a nice, dumb sleep.

457
00:25:54,448 --> 00:25:57,119
Let's knock her out, give her a children's
cough medicine, that's what does it.

458
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:58,874
<i>Is that safe?

459
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:01,139
- No, it's not safe.
- Yeah, it's expired.

460
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,592
- Come on, Dear, knock it back, Honey.
- Yeah.

461
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:07,004
- No!
- One more, knock it down, c'mon.

462
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:08,762
- Rudy!
- Do it, Tony.

463
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,747
- Let's do it, one more.
- I do not know. Rudy.

464
00:26:10,771 --> 00:26:11,438
Okay, one more.

465
00:26:11,488 --> 00:26:14,066
Enough of this, that's it,
I'm gonna make a hot toddy.

466
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:15,355
That's what she needs.

467
00:26:15,405 --> 00:26:19,537
<i>- You're gonna intoxicate her.
- It is natural, it's all herbal, nothing strong.

468
00:26:19,587 --> 00:26:26,195
I was kidnapped by another monk,
who was from Switzerland.

469
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:33,865
And it turned out that this monk,
was a duke of a royal family.

470
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,654
<i>I shouldn't say "was",
because he still "is".

471
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:40,527
Leave me alone.

472
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:43,343
I don't think we should let
her sleep on the stairs.

473
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:46,075
Let's just put her here on the couch,
okay?

474
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:04,312
<i>Seventeen years... Think
about it, we've been hiding,

475
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:06,778
for 17 years.

476
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:12,688
Seventeen years...
<i>we used to make things.

477
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:16,975
<i>Seventeen years ago... and that all stopped!
What HAPPENED?

478
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:24,356
When you're hiding, you're safe,
because people can't see you.

479
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:29,171
But the funny thing about hiding...

480
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:31,310
you're even hidden from yourself.

481
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,034
Baby, what's the matter?

482
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:51,471
Tony, you need to move out of basement,
you need to get your own home.

483
00:27:51,521 --> 00:27:52,826
What? Why?

484
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:56,428
Because I go out at night
and sing at Angela's club?

485
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:59,573
No, because we've been
divorced two years.

486
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:03,123
We need to move on.
<i>You need to move out.

487
00:28:03,843 --> 00:28:06,399
- Rudy, you need to move out, too.
- WHAT?

488
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:09,155
There's more room in
the basement for me now.

489
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:13,223
And another thing, Rudy, tomorrow I would like to
have a meeting with you and Trudy at your office

490
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:16,585
to discuss her investing in
manufacturing of my new idea.

491
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:22,477
No, I'm still getting to know her, I'm falling
in love, I can't do that, I won't do that.

492
00:28:22,768 --> 00:28:25,205
<i>And what manufacturing
idea, what are you talking about?

493
00:28:26,672 --> 00:28:28,476
I have always been there for you.

494
00:28:28,645 --> 00:28:29,981
No matter what.

495
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:32,307
I didn't go away to school,
I stayed to help you

496
00:28:32,357 --> 00:28:35,043
and Mom through the divorce
and do your accounting.

497
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:39,093
I let you live here whenever you want,
no matter what it is.

498
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:44,909
I am RESPECTFULLY asking for
the favor that you owe me.

499
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:48,549
If you look into your heart,
you'll know that I'm right.

500
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:55,198
Christie...

501
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:58,634
I need to use your crayons,
and your colored pencils and your paper.

502
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:01,275
Let's go to my room.

503
00:29:36,842 --> 00:29:40,335
<i>You're not gonna believe this,
you know that plumber that you recommended?

504
00:29:40,385 --> 00:29:42,150
<i>- Yes, Toussaint.
- Well, I hired him.

505
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:47,487
Terry freaks out, completely...
she hasn't had a man in her room for 8 years.

506
00:29:47,517 --> 00:29:50,001
Then Rudy makes me
hang a drop cloth.

507
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,297
The way I look at it,
is that this is an opportunity

508
00:29:52,358 --> 00:29:54,604
for you to invest in a new business...

509
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:58,573
that'll mean more money for you.

510
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:01,538
Tell Rico die number 5's gotta go off.

511
00:30:01,588 --> 00:30:03,840
Rico, number 5, no, off!

512
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,724
<i>Turn it off! Thank you.

513
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:12,212
It is a standard handle, 53 inches,
the sleeve connects to the mop head.

514
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:14,595
And this is where
it gets complicated.

515
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:18,285
There's a clip that
connects the sleeve to the...

516
00:30:18,636 --> 00:30:19,963
I don't even know
what to call it...

517
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:23,172
the cup,
which is connected to the mop head.

518
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:26,906
So, when you pull up on the sleeve,
the mop head stretches,

519
00:30:26,956 --> 00:30:29,526
so you can wring it without ever
touching it with your hands.

520
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:33,010
The only thing we see is this...
crayon drawings.

521
00:30:33,096 --> 00:30:36,681
- We can't make heads or tails.
- We don't know what is.

522
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:40,311
<i>So the mop doesn't hang loose,</i>
like hair, like a string?

523
00:30:40,361 --> 00:30:44,219
It hangs, but not on loose. open ends,
like hair, it's one continuous loop.

524
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:45,824
- I do not get it.
<i>- I do not get it.

525
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,034
- I do not get it. What's he doing here?
- What's he doing here?

526
00:30:48,188 --> 00:30:51,446
He is the father of our children,
and my friend, and he looks out for me.

527
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:03,216
- We are doing an invention.
- Cheers.

528
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:05,125
Hi.

529
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:08,181
Yes, we are, Christie.

530
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:11,025
It is very serious.

531
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,449
<i>- It's priority.</i>
- Yes, it is.

532
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:16,632
<i>- And I'm helping.
- Yes, you are.

533
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:29,534
It's crazy like that in Haiti.

534
00:31:29,584 --> 00:31:31,699
Toussaint is teaching
me how to speak French.

535
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,427
<i>And the word for industrious is...

536
00:31:34,477 --> 00:31:36,489
Worker.

537
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:40,897
At first I thought maybe something scary
would happen like what happed to Danica.

538
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:43,469
While she was
kidnapped by a man who,

539
00:31:43,557 --> 00:31:46,187
turned out to be hiding from
a royal family in Switzerland

540
00:31:46,287 --> 00:31:48,200
and then, she moved to Switzerland.

541
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,751
Of course,
she befriended that man, and more.

542
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:53,095
Don't ever try to limit me,
Joy.

543
00:31:53,282 --> 00:31:55,268
And let me know if you want
some of this Chacalaca.

544
00:31:55,318 --> 00:31:56,618
Chaka... say "Chaka"

545
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,340
- Chaka.
- It's very good.

546
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:00,726
Be seeing you.

547
00:32:00,822 --> 00:32:01,935
No more.

548
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:08,100
Hey, Rodney, hey, Tom.

549
00:32:12,197 --> 00:32:14,320
- Hello, Tito.
- Hey.

550
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:16,227
I wanna show
you something.

551
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:18,447
Maybe you help me
figure this out.

552
00:32:18,497 --> 00:32:21,186
I know that has to be welded,
and this part is supposed to twist.

553
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:50,579
One, 2,

554
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:55,259
- 3, 4, 5, 6,
- 4, 5, 6,

555
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:58,055
- What are you doing?
- 17, 18,

556
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:05,772
34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40.

557
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,141
All right,

558
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:10,266
all right, Dad, come over here and grab this,
grab it right in the middle.

559
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:18,024
Okay, there,
you go up, and down.

560
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:20,155
- You see it?
- Not yet.

561
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:21,231
All right.

562
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:25,134
- How about now?
- No.

563
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,385
<i>Well, you're going to.

564
00:33:26,905 --> 00:33:28,777
I don't see it yet,
I mean...

565
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:35,144
- You ready?
- Yeah.

566
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:40,079
- Oh!
- Ah!

567
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:47,280
Three hundred feet of continuous
cotton loops... that's what I drew.

568
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:52,453
This is why I would like to
ask you for your investment, Trudy.

569
00:33:53,298 --> 00:33:58,201
Maurice worked 50 years to
earn his fortune, Joy.

570
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:03,072
Before he passed on to the next world,
he made me promise, on his deathbed...

571
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:06,311
I would never be
neglectful with one dollar...

572
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:09,494
of the money that he
so carefully earned.

573
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:14,949
Therefore, you have to answer Maurice's
four questions of financial worthiness.

574
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:16,637
Are you ready?

575
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:19,086
I think so, yes.

576
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:21,914
Question number 1.

577
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:26,825
- Where did you go to high school?
- Pinefield Public High.

578
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:31,368
Question number 2.
Who were you in high school?

579
00:34:31,503 --> 00:34:33,330
I was valedictorian.

580
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:36,893
The smartest student
in the school.

581
00:34:37,013 --> 00:34:38,402
That's good, right?

582
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:41,111
Maybe.

583
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:46,784
Joy might be a BRILLIANT,
unrealized creator of commerce.

584
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:51,887
<i>But, on the other hand, it's equally possible
that she is a fatally flawed underachiever,

585
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:58,251
doomed to a lifetime of failure,
disappointment... unfulfilled expectations.

586
00:34:58,296 --> 00:35:05,498
You must admit, Joy, that your life to date
makes a stronger case for... disappointment.

587
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,774
I don't about any of this.
it's not only risky, but,

588
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:14,313
it's fiscally irresponsible and
doesn't make any sense whatsoever.

589
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:16,492
Joy's never run a
business in her life,

590
00:35:16,589 --> 00:35:19,177
I've been running my father's
garage for the last 10 years.

591
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:21,168
OUR father.

592
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:26,812
<i>I have ventures that I'm planning to launch,</i>
here, at this EXISTING business.

593
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:31,789
You've never mentioned any of this until
I came to Trudy and asked for investment.

594
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:34,513
What's Morris' third question.

595
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:38,442
Are you prepared,
within six months of commencing

596
00:35:38,496 --> 00:35:42,357
this venture, to show adequate returns?

597
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:45,610
- I accept your terms.
- Don't do it, Joy.

598
00:35:45,677 --> 00:35:47,644
What is the fourth question?

599
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:51,983
You are in a room and
there is a gun on the table,

600
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:57,279
and the only other person in the
room is an adversary in commerce.

601
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:59,840
Only one of you can prevail.

602
00:35:59,899 --> 00:36:05,688
<i>Yet, you have protected your
business and Maurice's money.

603
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:09,669
Do you pick up the gun,
Joy?

604
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:13,303
That's a very strange question.

605
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:17,499
There is nothing strange
about this question at all.

606
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:19,858
This is money.

607
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:24,370
Do you pick up the gun?

608
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,591
- I pick up the gun.
- Good.

609
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,825
I'm going to remember
you said that...

610
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:35,993
when I speak to my lawyer.

611
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:37,973
What did Trudy's lawyer say?

612
00:36:38,223 --> 00:36:42,045
- He did a World-Wide patent search.
- What's a patent?

613
00:36:43,101 --> 00:36:46,345
A patent is like a law that
you get to protect your idea.

614
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:51,869
A lot of people PATENT their ideas, but only
a FEW of them actually get their ideas made.

615
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:54,582
So, Trudy just wanted to be careful.

616
00:36:54,644 --> 00:37:00,333
<i>Joy, I just wanted to let you know that
Toussaint has almost finished his work.

617
00:37:00,383 --> 00:37:05,228
And, uh... yeah, we really to have
to find some more work for him.

618
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:07,292
<i>You want more
work in the house?

619
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:11,559
- I have another bitch I'll have to go to.
- What?

620
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:14,772
- Yes.
- But we have real issues here.

621
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,294
We don't have money for that work,
Mom.

622
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:19,229
Okay.

623
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:21,231
Joy.

624
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:25,098
- What is happening to you, Mother?
<i>- I don't know what's going on.

625
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:30,235
- Are you in love with Toussaint?
<i>- I... I am, I WAS feeling alone,

626
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:36,173
and I didn't even realize it,
ya know, and then...

627
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:43,572
What did the patent search find?

628
00:37:45,163 --> 00:37:48,659
Trudy just wanted to be careful,
and this guy found

629
00:37:48,709 --> 00:37:51,329
a man that's in Texas
who works another guy

630
00:37:51,703 --> 00:37:57,653
in another country where they have an
idea that MIGHT be similar to my mop.

631
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:00,791
- What country?
- Hong Kong.

632
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:04,309
Hong Kong man has a
representative in Dallas, Texas.

633
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:08,289
The Dallas man was very
reasonable with my lawyer.

634
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,151
Okay.

635
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:19,439
So, this guy in Texas...

636
00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:23,524
We're supposed to pay him a royalty
on the patent, as a protection, right?

637
00:38:23,724 --> 00:38:24,724
Right.

638
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:26,695
- To be safe from any claims.
- Yes.

639
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:29,771
- Is that correct?
- Please, stop using the word "we".

640
00:38:30,021 --> 00:38:32,489
None of this is YOUR
money or your business.

641
00:38:32,539 --> 00:38:35,888
But the same guy also
owns a manufacturing plant

642
00:38:36,088 --> 00:38:40,047
that your guys say is
cheaper than any other place?

643
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:41,113
In California.

644
00:38:41,202 --> 00:38:43,936
A metal and plastic
injection mold factory.

645
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:46,814
- Okay, so it's the same guy, he owns the patent...
- This happens all the time in business,

646
00:38:46,864 --> 00:38:50,673
- You find the best partner, it's smart.
- He doesn't understand business.

647
00:38:50,723 --> 00:38:51,738
He doesn't know business.

648
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:53,723
- I know, I'm just...
- I understand business.

649
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:57,228
<i>Dad and I, we buy parts for
the trucks all the time at the garage.

650
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:59,431
Maurice did it all the time.

651
00:38:59,526 --> 00:39:02,088
One stop shopping,
it's the cheapest.

652
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,074
- They're telling major story... yes!
- Is that normal?

653
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,844
But is it normal like
the same guy who has the

654
00:39:05,894 --> 00:39:08,170
patent is the same guy who
has the manufacturing?

655
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,205
- Yes, best, better, better, if you look at it that way.
- Yes.

656
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:13,735
<i>And the lawyer?
Why Morris' lawyer?

657
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:17,650
- Yeah, he's very good.
- Yeah, but he specialized in garment business.

658
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,289
- Tony...
- Not in manufacturing.

659
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:20,526
Tony...

660
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:23,261
Let's quit while we're ahead.

661
00:39:25,263 --> 00:39:29,650
<i>I know that you want Tony to be
your counselor, if you will, and

662
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:32,126
I will respect that,

663
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:35,563
<i>as Tony and you should
respect what we're

664
00:39:35,613 --> 00:39:40,305
<i>proposing as the lawyer for
this who business endeavor.

665
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:47,748
Well, all right,
the parts have arrived from California,

666
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:50,212
and we can start
manufacturing here.

667
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:53,246
I have the first assembled mop.

668
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:57,538
I told you it was gonna be
more refined, and it is.

669
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:02,761
Father Martinez is here, you need to set
those women up right now and get going.

670
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,254
<i>They're gonna be so grateful

671
00:40:04,304 --> 00:40:06,302
- I'm gonna go talk to those ladies.
<i>- for work, Joy.

672
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:08,355
Now we finally
have jobs for them.

673
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,660
I'm a little proud o'ya,
I gotta admit it.

674
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:14,289
But... it cost much more than
$15,000 to make the first run.

675
00:41:14,323 --> 00:41:17,645
I know, Trudy, but with all due
respect, that actually wasn't my fault.

676
00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:19,700
Look at this, more bills.

677
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,833
- WHAT?
<i>- Another bill from Gerhardt.

678
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:27,474
This guy keeps billing
me for his mistakes.

679
00:41:27,524 --> 00:41:28,974
That's business.

680
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:32,849
That's not the way I do business,
I'm calling this guy.

681
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:42,198
Gerhardt, I not gonna keep payin' for these parts
that are taking you four times to get right.

682
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:45,149
<i>That was your design,
you have to pay for those parts.

683
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:48,203
<i>That's mold making,
that's the process.

684
00:41:48,253 --> 00:41:50,614
<i>My client's pay
when we figure it out.

685
00:41:50,664 --> 00:41:53,725
It was not my design,
Gerhardt, it was your mistake.

686
00:41:53,945 --> 00:41:57,273
- I'm not payin' it.
<i>- That was your design, you have to...

687
00:41:57,315 --> 00:41:59,181
<i>Did he just hang up on you?

688
00:41:59,317 --> 00:42:02,774
This guy was supposed to
be easy and inexpensive.

689
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:05,691
He keeps overbilling us,
I'm not payin' for it.

690
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:09,696
Nobody pays it.

691
00:42:09,761 --> 00:42:11,546
I'm gonna fight it
out with this guy.

692
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:14,665
Just assemble them
and try to sell them.

693
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:19,128
Just put it in your window, let your customers
decide, my family's been goin' here my whole life.

694
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:22,168
Look, the big companies,
they pay me for my shelf space.

695
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:24,951
Maybe you could sell your mop
to one of those big companies,

696
00:42:25,176 --> 00:42:27,188
and maybe THEY'LL
put it on my shelf.

697
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:33,203
<i>It's expensive at nineteen ninety-five, but
it's the only mop you'll ever have to buy.

698
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:39,249
But I don't want people... to buy ONE mop for
$20, and never have to buy another mop again.

699
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:44,081
I'd rather they keep buying OUR mops
at $5 dollars 50 times, 100 times.

700
00:42:45,528 --> 00:42:49,964
Ah, you were broke,
and bored and you had an idea.

701
00:42:50,092 --> 00:42:52,224
So what,
lots of people have ideas.

702
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:55,458
<i>Go home, please,
take care of your family.

703
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:58,152
<i>Hi,
would you like to try a new mop?

704
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:00,556
Well, it's the only mop
you'll ever have to buy.

705
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,260
Hi, would you like to try
a new mop?

706
00:43:04,558 --> 00:43:06,208
<i>- No.
- It's self-wringing.

707
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,766
You can remove the mop head...
throw it in the washing machine.

708
00:43:08,853 --> 00:43:10,205
- No germs.
- No.

709
00:43:10,455 --> 00:43:12,302
- No.
- No?

710
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:14,986
You wanna just try it?
You can try it...

711
00:43:15,026 --> 00:43:18,077
It's self-wringing, ya see?
No other mop does this.

712
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:41,869
Come and try the
brand new mop!

713
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:45,981
- It's the mop of the future.
- No thanks.

714
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:48,630
- Wanna try this mop, Lady?
- What's this?

715
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:50,108
It's a brand new mop.

716
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,499
You can wring it without
getting your hands dirty.

717
00:43:53,549 --> 00:43:54,621
Naw, I don't think so.

718
00:43:54,671 --> 00:43:57,001
C'mon, try it,
it's the mop of the future.

719
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:01,150
- Self-wringer, huh?
- Yeah.

720
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:02,360
All right.

721
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:06,167
I do like the idea of that, ya know,
I hate havin' to touch the mop head

722
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:10,237
after I get done cleaning the bathroom
floor... I always think that disgusting.

723
00:44:10,505 --> 00:44:14,601
Wow, it really does get all the corners
that my sponge mop won't get...

724
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:18,486
all those crannies where
my kids spill their juice.

725
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:22,417
- I really like it, can we buy it?
- Take it easy, Christie.

726
00:44:22,793 --> 00:44:26,119
Wow, I mean, that's just amazing,
you really don't have to touch it.

727
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:28,256
Look at that! You know what would
make this perfect, if

728
00:44:28,299 --> 00:44:31,003
you could remove the mop head,
put it in the washing machine...

729
00:44:31,053 --> 00:44:32,167
really get it clean.

730
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:34,232
- You can.
- What!?

731
00:44:34,282 --> 00:44:35,587
Are you serious!?

732
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:38,058
<i>- How much is this mop?
- Nineteen ninety-five.

733
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:38,937
No, that's too much.

734
00:44:38,987 --> 00:44:42,703
But, I guess, I mean, but if it is the only mop
that you ever have to buy, I mean we keep buying...

735
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,783
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, Baby.

736
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:49,807
<i>You... you remember Angela...</i>
and two brothers, right?

737
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:51,544
I do... hello.

738
00:44:51,594 --> 00:44:53,498
- Mommy, the policeman.
- Ma'am.

739
00:44:53,548 --> 00:44:54,690
<i>Did we break the law?

740
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:56,692
- We're takin' this with us.
- No! Don't! We're leavin'.

741
00:44:57,016 --> 00:44:58,649
Now I'm gonna let you
off with a warning.

742
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:02,257
- No! Sir! I feel like it's a couple of minutes...
- If I catch you around here again...

743
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:04,164
- you WILL be prosecuted.
- the mop can do it...

744
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:05,909
- Where would I go?
- You cannot sell on

745
00:45:05,959 --> 00:45:07,170
- Kmart property.
- Sir, please, I made those mops myself.

746
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,648
I paid for them, please!

747
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:11,283
I won't come back but you
don't have to take my stuff!

748
00:45:11,342 --> 00:45:12,274
Please!

749
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:14,895
- Are you even allowed to do this?
- How embarrassing for you,

750
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:18,008
to be seen here like this with your
daughter, <i>what kind of parent are you?

751
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,498
<i>- Yeah, Tony.
- Enough!

752
00:45:20,785 --> 00:45:23,029
- Come, let's go c'mon, let's go.
- Tony, let's go.

753
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,836
Yeah, I'm comin', I'm coming.

754
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:39,260
Honey, it's okay, Mommy's okay.

755
00:45:42,273 --> 00:45:45,377
This stupid thing...
this place is fallin' apart!

756
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:48,707
No! No!

757
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:52,749
<i>- Honey, the telephone isn't working.</i>
- I know, I just got the notice.

758
00:45:52,817 --> 00:45:55,035
I had to go next door
to use the phone.

759
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:57,236
- Tommy's got a fever.
- Tommy has a fever!?

760
00:45:57,286 --> 00:46:00,247
A simple cold, it's a cough,
it's goin' around, all the kids have it.

761
00:46:00,297 --> 00:46:01,991
<i>Thank God the
heat's still working.

762
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:06,118
- Mommy, why isn't this phone working?
- Because I'm late on paying the bill.

763
00:46:06,851 --> 00:46:08,904
- Not you, too?
- Are we going to lose this house?

764
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:10,782
No, we're not gonna lose our house.

765
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:13,167
Come on, get upstairs,
get in the bath.

766
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:14,554
Listen to your Mom,
get right in that tub.

767
00:46:14,604 --> 00:46:16,323
- I don't have to.
- I don't care.

768
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:20,506
Christie, you get in that hot bath, listen to
your mother, I don't want you getting sick, too.

769
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:25,092
Lauren Rose said you're a cleaning
lady and you sell used mops.

770
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:28,119
Lauren Rose said that?

771
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:32,013
Yeah, and I really hurt my feelings.

772
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:35,999
First of all,
even if I was a cleaning lady, so what?

773
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:37,556
There's no shame in hard work.

774
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:41,168
And second of all, you know, I'm...

775
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:46,660
I'm tryin' to sell a new mop,
not used mops.

776
00:46:47,071 --> 00:46:48,455
And third of all...

777
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:52,261
don't...
don't take any guff from anybody.

778
00:46:52,677 --> 00:46:55,524
Ya know, don't... don't let it in.

779
00:46:56,547 --> 00:46:59,495
I know it's hard,
and I'm sorry that happened.

780
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:02,537
Now, get in the bath.

781
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:12,766
Aw, c'mon,
go to sleep, Honey.

782
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:27,823
Joy.

783
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,795
- Not now, Mimi.
- Joy, wait, wait..

784
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:35,069
Just tell me what happened today, I want
know how it went, please, I want to know.

785
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:38,917
It was a disaster.

786
00:47:39,657 --> 00:47:43,151
But you must never give up, ever since
you were little you were born to bear...

787
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,601
Bear what, Mimi?

788
00:47:45,651 --> 00:47:46,855
Failure?

789
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:48,378
Disgrace?

790
00:47:48,554 --> 00:47:51,795
Humiliation in front
of my daughter?

791
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:56,198
You were born to be the...
presence in the world.

792
00:47:56,574 --> 00:47:59,751
And I know that I'm gonna
live to see you grow to be

793
00:47:59,851 --> 00:48:03,082
the successful matriarch
that you were born to be.

794
00:48:03,147 --> 00:48:04,669
Matriarch...

795
00:48:05,394 --> 00:48:08,679
- To be a mother with courage.
- Who can't even support her children.

796
00:48:09,153 --> 00:48:10,414
<i>Sweetheart...

797
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:15,669
What are you doin' here?

798
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:19,127
I have this idea... a guy I know.

799
00:48:19,163 --> 00:48:20,795
- What guy?
- He used to work with me.

800
00:48:21,532 --> 00:48:24,803
And now he works at this... big retailer.

801
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:26,622
A new way of doing business.

802
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:28,912
I mean, it's worth a try.

803
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:33,697
- You would do that for me?
- Of course.

804
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:36,257
<i>They were the best
divorced couple in America.

805
00:48:37,181 --> 00:48:40,496
<i>Much better friends than
they were husband and wife.

806
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,563
I can get you a
meeting with him.

807
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:46,025
Where is it?

808
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:52,211
<i>I don't understand what we're
doing in Amish country, they don't

809
00:48:52,261 --> 00:48:55,059
even have electricity out here,
how can they sell anything on TV?

810
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:57,221
It has nothing to do with it
with the Amish people.

811
00:48:57,271 --> 00:49:01,212
It just happens to be located here,
I looked it up... in Amish country.

812
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,324
- AH-misch.
- What?

813
00:49:03,374 --> 00:49:05,271
- AH-misch.
- AH-misch.

Sign in, please.

815
00:49:20,758 --> 00:49:23,557
We're here to see Marv Brickman.

816
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:29,181
Okay, Marv Brickman, does he know
who you are if I call his office?

817
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:32,390
Of course he know, we're friends,
we used to work together.

818
00:49:46,816 --> 00:49:48,661
<i>Tom was wrong about that...

819
00:49:54,124 --> 00:49:56,565
<i>- Tony.</i>
- Marv, how are you?

820
00:49:56,788 --> 00:49:58,402
- I can't see you today.
- Why?

821
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:03,269
- Maybe tomorrow, if you can stay in town.
- No, we have the kids at home.

822
00:50:04,134 --> 00:50:05,902
- We can stay.
- See you tomorrow.

823
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:09,095
Listen, you can't just expect
to come in here and see someone.

824
00:50:09,106 --> 00:50:10,289
Did you take care of
that advertising?

825
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,960
- Yes, I did.
- Good.

826
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:15,179
- What's going on here?
- This is my good friend, Tony.

827
00:50:15,229 --> 00:50:17,336
- Tony Miranda.
- We work together at Campbell's.

828
00:50:17,386 --> 00:50:20,207
- Leo Walker.
- And this is... she's his ex-wife.

829
00:50:20,257 --> 00:50:21,411
- Joy.
- Hi, Leo.

830
00:50:21,461 --> 00:50:23,728
She's an inventor, she wanted
two minutes of your time today, but...

831
00:50:23,778 --> 00:50:25,959
Leo, don't worry about this.

832
00:50:26,009 --> 00:50:27,315
- Ya know, maybe tomorrow.
- You know what...

833
00:50:27,365 --> 00:50:30,005
Ya know, why don't ya for five minutes
while the sales group's still here?

834
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:33,015
<i>- Are you sure?
- Yeah, absolutely.

835
00:50:33,065 --> 00:50:34,256
<i>Thank you.

836
00:50:34,298 --> 00:50:35,782
- Ya got everything?
- Yeah.

837
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,328
- Great.
- Thank you, Man.

838
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:39,345
Thank you.

839
00:50:47,277 --> 00:50:49,268
So, tell us your name, please.

840
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:54,330
I'm Joy.

841
00:50:56,186 --> 00:51:00,910
- And what would you like to show us today?
<i>- I have a self-wring mop.

842
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:03,058
<i>So...

843
00:51:03,093 --> 00:51:04,977
- Do you need some help?
<i>- No, got it.

844
00:51:05,329 --> 00:51:06,861
<i>Oh! Sorry.

845
00:51:07,331 --> 00:51:09,286
<i>That's my shoe...

846
00:51:09,336 --> 00:51:11,926
<i>Oh my goodness,
I'm so sorry, Sir.

847
00:51:15,353 --> 00:51:16,731
<i>Do you mind...

848
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:18,905
I'm sorry.

849
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:23,718
Is that plastic?

850
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:26,087
- Yes..
- Arnold, why don't you give it a try?

851
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:28,081
- Is that okay?
<i>- Yes, of course.

852
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:30,932
- Just dunk it.
- I dip it?

853
00:51:30,954 --> 00:51:32,895
- Yes.
- And then I...

854
00:51:33,724 --> 00:51:36,092
- push?
- You pull, you have to pull it.

855
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:39,638
- Pull it, pull it first.
- Push it in there.

856
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:42,397
<i>Pull and twist,
just like when you're on the road.

857
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:47,615
We don't mean to be disrespectful,
Joy, it's been a long day for us.

858
00:51:49,273 --> 00:51:52,490
I feel like I wanna tell you
a little bit about who I am.

859
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:57,310
'Cause I have a feeling you don't know exactly
where you are right now, am I right?

860
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,208
<i>10 months ago...

861
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:03,549
a man named Barry Dillard
called me from Los Angeles,

862
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:09,004
He started a television network,
Fox Television Channel.

863
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:13,600
And prior to that, he ran 20th Century Fox,
among other studios.

864
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:19,082
And he acquired a little cable channel,
<i>right here in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

865
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:21,926
<i>And he hired me to run it...

866
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:24,550
as a bigger idea.

867
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:28,581
I'm from Detroit, Michigan.

868
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:33,910
I ran America's largest,
most affordable,

869
00:52:34,589 --> 00:52:39,255
successful, value driven retailer,
<i>a chain called Kmart.

870
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:43,243
<i>Prior to that,
I was buyer for K-Mart.

871
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:48,220
<i>And prior to that,
I managed seven separate Kmart stores.

872
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:51,795
I decide what products we
let into our stores here...

873
00:52:51,845 --> 00:52:54,778
into people's homes,
24 hours a day,

874
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,124
for our valued customers.

875
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:01,924
I choose very carefully
and very conservatively.

876
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:06,884
I spend most of my day deflecting
incoming shots from people like yourself.

877
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:11,637
You see that chart?

878
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:21,142
This green line here rises
or stays the same each month.

879
00:53:22,499 --> 00:53:25,204
There is no problem with
my product choice.

880
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:29,135
Do you know what Q-V-C stands for,
Joy?

881
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:32,780
No, I don't.

882
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:36,691
Quality, Value, Convenience.

883
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:41,468
I sell products affordably,
but I don't sell cheap products,

884
00:53:41,652 --> 00:53:44,209
and your mop is plastic
and it looks strange.

885
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:53,790
I don't know anything about charts, or...
business, frankly,

886
00:53:54,164 --> 00:53:56,975
but I made this mop, do clean my own home,

887
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:00,641
and I did this mop,
because it is better

888
00:54:00,841 --> 00:54:03,699
than anything else out there.

889
00:54:06,143 --> 00:54:07,667
Please give me a chance.

890
00:54:10,113 --> 00:54:14,645
I like that it's plastic, because it's
so light, in my hands it's like nothing.

891
00:54:15,185 --> 00:54:19,456
<i>It's also 10 times more absorbent
than any other mop on the market, why?

892
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:24,756
Because it's 300 feet of continuous
cotton loop, that I looped myself.

893
00:54:25,195 --> 00:54:29,739
That is an enormous amount of absorbent
cotton on a very small mop head.

894
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:33,672
Now, I'm done with the bathroom,
and I haven't wrung the mop once.

895
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:35,549
Let me ask you a question.

896
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:38,602
Would you take this mop,
when you were just cleaning the

897
00:54:38,684 --> 00:54:41,200
bathroom and around the toilet
and all of those germs...

898
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:44,038
and take it into the kitchen where

899
00:54:44,238 --> 00:54:47,183
your family eats,
where you feed your children?

900
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:50,666
I take this mop head,
I put it in the washing machine,

901
00:54:50,735 --> 00:54:52,606
it comes out clean like new.

902
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:56,324
You can't do that
with any other mop.

903
00:54:57,194 --> 00:54:58,600
- So...
- So...

904
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:05,585
Can you make 50 thousand
of these mops by next week?

905
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:10,023
Yeah, I think so.

906
00:55:11,942 --> 00:55:14,235
David Selznick he was
the son of an immigrant,

907
00:55:14,244 --> 00:55:17,845
married Jennifer Jones from Oklahoma,
America's sweetheart.

908
00:55:18,181 --> 00:55:20,019
That just goes to show
you that in America

909
00:55:20,217 --> 00:55:24,463
the ordinary makes
extraordinary every single day.

910
00:55:24,888 --> 00:55:26,231
Thomas, where you going with that?

911
00:55:26,432 --> 00:55:27,699
- The skinny pants you wanted.
- Yeah.

912
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:30,814
No, I never said skinny pants, no,
I said stove pipe, classic look.

913
00:55:30,961 --> 00:55:31,883
I heard skinny pants.

914
00:55:31,962 --> 00:55:34,432
No, I always... I...
you know how much I love the stove pipe.

915
00:55:34,482 --> 00:55:36,612
- Stove pipe, classic, got it.
- Got it. Got it. Got it. got it.

916
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:38,295
- From now on we go with stove pipe.
- Thank you.

917
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:43,561
<i>You see those guys, I told them so many
times, they still don't understand.

918
00:55:44,141 --> 00:55:46,075
A very smart guy once said:

919
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:47,896
Tell somebody something once,
they don't listen,

920
00:55:47,934 --> 00:55:49,172
tell somebody 4 times,
they don't listen,

921
00:55:49,279 --> 00:55:52,593
by the ninth time you say it,
they begin to hear you.

922
00:55:52,643 --> 00:55:54,249
That's why we're
on 24 hours a day.

923
00:55:54,299 --> 00:55:57,033
That why those people I have
to tell about the stove pipe.

924
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:00,065
Music in the makeup rooms?

925
00:56:00,115 --> 00:56:01,417
Yeah,
I thought I'd give a sense of place.

926
00:56:01,576 --> 00:56:03,381
But if you don't want it,
you can always turn it down.

927
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,820
You're our biggest seller,
Todd, whatever you need to do

928
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:08,283
to make you comfortable why are we care
about, you're our number one seller.

929
00:56:08,307 --> 00:56:10,275
- What!?
- Oh, no.

930
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:12,454
He's your number one seller?

931
00:56:12,504 --> 00:56:15,508
No, no, no, no... Cindy, Cindy,
please, you know that we love you.

932
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:18,084
Oh, for Heaven's sake.

933
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:22,269
She's never had a professional attitude,
and clearly she's jealous.

934
00:56:22,312 --> 00:56:24,590
But can you do me a favor
and make your friend?

935
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,472
Can you just do me that favor,
Todd?

936
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:29,211
Please, for me.

937
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,052
- Yes.
- Thank you.

938
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:34,284
This is Joy, she has a very exciting new
mop that we're going to introduce next week.

939
00:56:34,324 --> 00:56:36,817
I would like you to launch,
you're my first choice.

940
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:41,865
Uh... Mop... you want me to
bring this newborn into the world?

941
00:56:42,633 --> 00:56:49,642
That newborn that you're holding is every cent,
every dollar, even debt, that I've ever made.

942
00:56:49,692 --> 00:56:52,274
- Every cent you've ever made?
- That's right.

943
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:54,451
That kind of pressure
is not helpful.

944
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:56,383
- What?
- No...

945
00:56:56,647 --> 00:56:58,797
It's not part of my process,
either.

946
00:56:59,361 --> 00:57:00,247
Oh!

947
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:03,936
- Todd.
- I didn't mean to pressure you, Todd, I...

948
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:07,542
<i>We're... and we're finicky creatures.

949
00:57:07,592 --> 00:57:10,422
- He's very sensitive.
-  He IS our number one seller,

950
00:57:10,475 --> 00:57:13,817
he's selling EVERYTHING through the
roof with numbers we've never seen before.

951
00:57:14,331 --> 00:57:15,951
I take it very seriously,

952
00:57:16,001 --> 00:57:18,170
I see it as a privilege that we
have to go into people's homes

953
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:20,068
and I despise anybody
who's cynical about that.

954
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:23,454
Jack Warner wasn't cynical about that,
Darryl Zanuck wasn't cynical about that,

955
00:57:23,654 --> 00:57:25,200
and Neil Walker is not
cynical about that.

956
00:57:25,242 --> 00:57:27,210
Let me show you the stage.

957
00:57:27,844 --> 00:57:35,458
I believe, eventually, one day, television will
even be BY and ABOUT actual, regular people.

958
00:57:36,086 --> 00:57:38,613
Even on computers,
24 hours a day.

959
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:41,752
Who knows, nobody thought
this network would be real.

960
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:43,991
And here we are.

961
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:46,828
<i>By the,
stocks goin' through the roof.

962
00:57:49,266 --> 00:57:51,031
Must be mine
or Joan's dog.

963
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,485
Who's Joan?

964
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:53,837
Who is Joan?

965
00:57:54,938 --> 00:57:56,989
Thank you, Darling.

966
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:00,536
Oh, you're <i>never going to make it
in a man's world dressed like that.

967
00:58:01,468 --> 00:58:02,886
<i>Oh, Mister Peepers...

968
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:07,381
<i>It's a round stage,
it has 4 or 5 different sets that rotate,

969
00:58:07,431 --> 00:58:09,888
<i>depending on what we're
selling at a given moment.

970
00:58:10,898 --> 00:58:14,996
<i>Look at the quality of this...

971
00:58:15,926 --> 00:58:19,409
Here comes Joan and Cindy,
watch this.

972
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:22,968
These guys are major,
<i>Joan's the original seller.

973
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:28,845
<i>Can you do anything better than...
your blacks, your... your pearls.

974
00:58:28,895 --> 00:58:29,204
- Everything!
- Everything!

975
00:58:29,205 --> 00:58:31,173
Everything, look at it against the peach.

976
00:58:31,207 --> 00:58:33,054
Look at that... morning.

977
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:34,635
Look at that green... afternoon.

978
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:36,648
- Look...black.
- Evening.

979
00:58:36,698 --> 00:58:40,147
Of course, can you be more elegant?
So, it's functional,

980
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:42,735
- elegant...
- You can wear it alone, you can wear it...

981
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:43,927
<i>What I love...

982
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:46,155
The stars are people,
they always make the mistake of thinking

983
00:58:46,179 --> 00:58:49,154
it's about the face, but it's not,
it's about the hands.

984
00:58:49,204 --> 00:58:51,127
Because that's what people use...

985
00:58:51,227 --> 00:58:52,809
they hold things they care about...

986
00:58:52,864 --> 00:58:55,196
and her hands are going
to become their hands.

987
00:58:55,293 --> 00:58:58,937
And that becomes them,
and then their voice and then their eyes.

988
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:00,881
The stars always make
the mistake.

989
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:04,514
<i>It's really not the hands and the voice,
that's the heart of it.

990
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:07,266
6-2-7-6...

991
00:59:07,678 --> 00:59:10,645
A hundred dollar value.
Are they not phenomenal?

992
00:59:11,247 --> 00:59:12,894
Now watch this.

993
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:15,355
Cindy's gonna let us down, right...

Calls, calls, calls,
calls, calls, calls.

Calls... <i>look at the counter,
I guarantee you we're gonna go over 20.

00:59:44,147 --> 00:59:45,205
<i>Do you mind,
you busy?

1008
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:47,025
- Is the queue full?
<I>- The queue's full.

1009
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:49,129
You can hear a phone
call right now.

1010
00:59:49,219 --> 00:59:51,582
When they can't call through,
we gotta keep 'em watching.

1011
00:59:51,643 --> 00:59:54,547
- Did we get a call, did we get a call?
- Okay... we got it!

1012
00:59:54,597 --> 00:59:56,204
Joan, phone call right now!

1013
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:59,745
<i>We have a caller! We have a caller.</i>
Ah, Sharon from Colorado.

1014
00:59:59,795 --> 01:00:01,392
- Hi, Sharon!
<i>- Hi, Sharon.

1015
01:00:01,442 --> 01:00:04,004
<i>Cindy and Joan,
I can't believe I'm talking to you.

1016
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,510
<i>- Are you happy
with your necklace?

1017
01:00:05,588 --> 01:00:09,480
<i>These necklaces are SO
gorgeous and timeless.

1018
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:10,744
<i>Well, good for you.

1019
01:00:10,794 --> 01:00:16,090
<i>My grandmother had things like this,
I am so excited to have these here.

1020
01:00:16,114 --> 01:00:21,411
<i>Go, go, yes, yes, yes,
go, yes, yes, yes...

1021
01:00:22,485 --> 01:00:23,535
Joy!

01:00:25,621 --> 01:00:27,029
Do you see those numbers?

1023
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:29,368
We're gonna wind-up
with 25 thousand.

1024
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,960
- Cindy knows how to close it.
- Wow!

1025
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:36,273
Okay, I want to go home,
I want you to call your lawyer,

1026
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:39,697
look at the contract,
make sure your product factory is in line.

1027
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:42,944
- Okay?
- Okay.

1028
01:00:43,106 --> 01:00:45,765
Okay, Godspeed, good luck,
here we go, I'll walk ya out.

1029
01:00:48,912 --> 01:00:54,068
You can't expect Trudy to write a check
for 200,000 dollars for 50,000 mops,

1030
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:58,512
when you already owe her 18,000 to
make mops you haven't even sold yet.

1031
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:02,282
Do you understand that
there is a business...

1032
01:01:02,792 --> 01:01:05,498
that wants to sell
my mop on television?

1033
01:01:06,129 --> 01:01:07,621
It's going to sell.

1034
01:01:08,131 --> 01:01:11,904
<i>Fine, you feel so strongly about it,
you put up half the money.

1035
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:15,633
Yes, it's only fair that you
share the financial risks, too.

1036
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:18,383
How's she gonna do that?
She's got nothing, she's got no money.

1037
01:01:21,144 --> 01:01:23,968
What? You want me to take out
a second mortgage on my house?

1038
01:01:28,885 --> 01:01:31,256
They want me to take out a
second mortgage on my house.

1039
01:01:31,306 --> 01:01:32,530
A second mortgage?

1040
01:01:32,622 --> 01:01:36,886
<i>- But the house, the kids?
- What's gonna happen, Joy, how would you do that?

1041
01:01:36,926 --> 01:01:38,389
I don't know.

1042
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:54,133
Hey, how ya doin'?

1043
01:01:54,177 --> 01:01:57,078
You know, I've been watchin' you through
that fence since you were a little girl.

1044
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:58,369
I've been watchin'
you grow up.

1045
01:01:58,419 --> 01:01:59,845
- Hey, listen.
- What?

1046
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:01,437
Would it be okay if I...

1047
01:02:01,485 --> 01:02:03,546
- You wanna fire a few rounds?
- I do.

1048
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:06,012
- Good, it might make you feel better.
- Thank you, I think I will.

1049
01:02:06,078 --> 01:02:07,384
- You know how to hold it?
- Yeah, yeah.

1050
01:02:07,434 --> 01:02:09,088
Okay, go ahead.

1051
01:02:14,097 --> 01:02:15,155
Good!

1052
01:02:16,132 --> 01:02:17,224
Good!

1053
01:02:18,134 --> 01:02:19,294
Good!

1054
01:02:35,852 --> 01:02:38,049
Oh, my God.

1055
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:40,961
<i>Get ready,
this is definitely gonna change the holidays

1056
01:02:40,996 --> 01:02:44,578
<i>for anyone who has
a floor</i> or a bathroom.

1057
01:02:44,628 --> 01:02:47,959
Because we have the most exciting
new home product in years.

1058
01:02:48,709 --> 01:02:51,909
<i>This is the new,
self-wringing mop...

1059
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:53,135
Okay, okay.

1060
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:56,135
<i>the new standard in homes.
Right here.

1061
01:02:56,185 --> 01:02:59,804
<i>Let's take a look at this.
This is brought to you only by QVC.

1062
01:02:59,843 --> 01:03:06,039
<i>Now, this is clearly extremely
soft and absorbent cotton.

1063
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:08,751
<i>Here we go,
we just take this...

1064
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:10,766
<i>And you...

1065
01:03:13,056 --> 01:03:15,251
<i>This is a little
trickier than it looks.

1066
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:18,021
We put it...

1067
01:03:18,061 --> 01:03:20,086
Whoops,
it's gettin' my arm wet here.

1068
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:22,891
<i>Let's see,
we got no sales here.

1069
01:03:24,033 --> 01:03:26,342
<i>- Maybe... maybe, maybe a caller, is there a caller?
- What happened?

1070
01:03:27,571 --> 01:03:30,266
<i>So there... so there are no calls.

1071
01:03:31,274 --> 01:03:32,649
<i>All right.

1072
01:03:36,212 --> 01:03:41,182
<i>And we do NOT have any sales still,
so, this is what we're gonna do.

1073
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:44,463
<i>We're gonna move on now, we're gonna
move on to Cindy. who's gonna talk to

1074
01:03:44,563 --> 01:03:48,056
<i>Serena Kendall,
Former star from Falcon Crest and Dynasty.

<i>That is absolutely amazing,
I want you to pan here, look at these.

1080
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:14,049
<i>Look at the detail, look at the detail,
look at the value in that.

1081
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:16,243
<i>About how many sequins
would you say that is?

1082
01:04:16,285 --> 01:04:18,150
- That's it?
- That's all?

1083
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:20,969
No! It's over!
That's how fast it happens!

1084

- They're not gonna give her a second chance.
<i>- Don't give her another chance.

1085
01:04:23,314 --> 01:04:25,160
- Now what's gonna happen?
- No, wait.

1086
01:04:25,328 --> 01:04:28,320
They're going to give her a second chance!

1087
01:04:28,331 --> 01:04:31,451
- They will.
- 200,000 dollars.

1088
01:04:33,069 --> 01:04:34,554
50,000 mops.

1089
01:05:06,824 --> 01:05:08,079
Joy...

1090
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:15,173
Hello.

1091
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:21,683
Five thousand, one hundred and seven
sequins for... get this, how much?

1092
01:05:22,185 --> 01:05:23,835
Two ninety-nine.

1093
01:05:27,123 --> 01:05:29,284
I'm sorry the
product didn't sell.

1094
01:05:32,228 --> 01:05:34,516
That man didn't know
what he was doing, Neil.

1095
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:39,576
Well, it wasn't the man,
Joy, it was the product.

1096
01:05:46,175 --> 01:05:49,536
I made 50,000 units
because you told me to.

1097
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:54,414
I mortgage my house,
I'm in 200,000 dollars of debt, more.

1098
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:58,527
Well, it's your business,
your debt.

1099
01:05:58,577 --> 01:06:01,366
And we indemnify up to a third,
if you read your contract.

1100
01:06:02,525 --> 01:06:05,325
To be honest,
that's even gonna be hard to get.

1101
01:06:07,163 --> 01:06:09,144
Neil, you gotta give us
another chance.

1102
01:06:10,233 --> 01:06:14,199
I'm SO sorry, Joy, I just can't
bring it to my boss, I can't.

1103
01:06:17,273 --> 01:06:19,554
I can't accept your answer.

1104
01:06:21,043 --> 01:06:23,918
I can't, and I won't.

1105
01:06:25,748 --> 01:06:28,743
<i>Joy, you have to let
Trudy report this loss

1106
01:06:28,792 --> 01:06:32,214
<i>to bankruptcy, because otherwise
she's gonna hemorrhage even more money.

1107
01:06:32,255 --> 01:06:35,094
<i>You have to file, too,
because of your mortgage,

1108
01:06:35,154 --> 01:06:39,606
<i>your children's future, and your loss
and you have to prepare yourself for that.

1109
01:06:39,696 --> 01:06:41,356
<i>We have to file for bankruptcy?

1110
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:43,786
<i>I warned you many times, Joy.

1111
01:06:43,866 --> 01:06:45,884
<i>Dad, I warned you not to
spend the money!

1112
01:06:45,958 --> 01:06:52,158
<i>You can go out and gas
her from the very beginning, Peggy

1113
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:54,071
I'm in a meeting
with our lawyers.

1114
01:06:54,911 --> 01:06:56,087
What do you think
you're doing?

1115
01:06:58,181 --> 01:06:59,735
"Go home, Joy."

1116
01:07:00,183 --> 01:07:03,294
"And watch the numbers
roll in on television."

1117
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,467
"Make up to 50,000 mops."

1118
01:07:06,517 --> 01:07:10,626
Borrowing and owing every dollar,
including your home.

1119
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:13,814
It could have been handled better,
I'll let Todd have another shot...

1120
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:18,612
I don't want Todd or anyone
else to try it, it should be me.

1121
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:23,795
We don't have regular people, we have
celebrities as spokesmen that do the selling.

1122
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:25,372
I told you this.

1123
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:27,731
Who showed YOU the mop?

1124
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:30,176
Who you sold it to you?
Who taught YOU how to use it?

1125
01:07:30,226 --> 01:07:34,018
And who convinced YOU that was great
after you thought it was worthless?

1126
01:07:38,321 --> 01:07:40,644
Excuse me,
can you give us a second?

1127
01:07:41,324 --> 01:07:42,831
Come with me.

1128
01:07:53,135 --> 01:07:56,050
Ever been in front of a TV camera? Are
you comfortable in front of a TV camera?

1129
01:07:56,172 --> 01:07:59,658
Because when you get there, there's lights,
and there's cameras, and people freeze up.

1130
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:03,766
You said to me that David
Selznick, the son of immigrants,

1131
01:08:03,823 --> 01:08:07,209
married Jennifer Jones,
an All American girl from Oklahoma,

1132
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:11,024
because, in America,
all races, and all classes,

1133
01:08:11,224 --> 01:08:14,676
can meet and make whatever
opportunities they can,

1134
01:08:14,991 --> 01:08:19,629
and THAT is what you feel, when you reach
into people's homes, with what you sell.

1135
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,134
You said that.

1136
01:08:27,136 --> 01:08:30,272
<i>What do you think?
Looks great, right?

1137
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:34,729
Yeah, yeah, it's beautiful,
very girl, very classic.

1138
01:08:35,011 --> 01:08:37,236
All right, if you come back next time...
Lori, Lori...

1139
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:38,118
Yeah?

1140
01:08:38,218 --> 01:08:40,917
I just want you to take
it a little bit forward,

1141
01:08:40,983 --> 01:08:43,488
Just like that...
if she comes back again.

1142
01:08:43,938 --> 01:08:45,472
Not with the comb,
not with the comb.

1143
01:08:45,624 --> 01:08:47,221
- Try the black.
- Okay.

1144
01:08:47,256 --> 01:08:48,442
- Okay?
- Okay.

1145
01:08:48,758 --> 01:08:49,888
It's gonna be perfect.

1146
01:09:02,338 --> 01:09:03,521
Wow.

1147
01:09:07,109 --> 01:09:09,186
Beautiful. What do you think?
How do you feel?

1148
01:09:10,913 --> 01:09:13,715
I'd like to change just one thing.
Do you mind?

1149
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:16,074
- Okay, surprise me.
- One small thing.

1150
01:09:16,285 --> 01:09:18,925
- I'll surprise you.
- Okay, surprise me.

1151
01:09:21,257 --> 01:09:23,707
I want the small
thing is that she changes.

1152
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:29,256
What!

1153
01:09:29,799 --> 01:09:31,451
You un-did the whole thing.

1154
01:09:32,735 --> 01:09:34,761
- This is me.
<i>- This is you?

1155
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:37,232
<i>You've got the exact same outfit
you had when you came in here.

1156
01:09:37,239 --> 01:09:41,270
I wear a blouse and I wear
pants, that's who I am.

1157
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:43,422
I wanna go on as me.

1158
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:48,371
You wanna go on as you,
then I hope you make it back.

1159
01:09:49,218 --> 01:09:51,619
Joan, Cindy,
say good luck to Joy.

1160
01:09:51,669 --> 01:09:54,145
Well, you look great,
good luck today.

1161
01:09:54,195 --> 01:09:55,128
- Oh, thank you.
- Good luck!

1162
01:09:55,178 --> 01:09:56,255
<i>That's her, that's how she is.

1163
01:09:56,269 --> 01:10:00,127
Blouse and... she should be in a skirt,
she's got nice, long legs, show her legs.

1164
01:10:00,129 --> 01:10:01,202
<i>Good luck.

1165
01:10:01,252 --> 01:10:04,290
Joan Rivers wants me in a skirt,
but I'm gonna use the pants.

1166
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:07,683
<i>Do what you wanna do.</i>
C'mon let's go upstairs.

1167
01:10:17,747 --> 01:10:19,819
- Are you nervous?
- Yes.

1168
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:23,629
Be yourself, and remember,
it's all about the hands.

1169
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,658
Here we go.

1170
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:44,330
<i>Ready!
The stage is moving!

1171
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:46,870
<i>Household product three
hundred seventy-five.

1172
01:10:46,976 --> 01:10:49,067
<i>In 3... 2...

1173
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:55,709
What are you doing?

1174
01:10:56,152 --> 01:10:58,012
Come on! Go!

1175
01:10:58,420 --> 01:10:59,507
Go!

1176
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:02,342
She's freezing.

1177
01:11:04,393 --> 01:11:07,124
Hi! These lights are so bright...

1178
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:12,457
Nobody tells you how bright these...
well, Neil did tell me.

1179
01:11:14,170 --> 01:11:17,118
Neil is my boss here.

1180
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:22,010
I should thank him for
letting me be up here.

1181
01:11:22,044 --> 01:11:24,137
- Uh... sorry.
- You're Joy!

1182
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:25,238
I am Joy?

1183
01:11:25,247 --> 01:11:28,142
Just say something,
talk about the mop!

1184
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:31,296
Oh, my God!
We have to do something.

1185
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:34,146
<i>We have to do something.

1186
01:11:34,223 --> 01:11:35,895
Do we have a call?
Can we go to a call?

1187
01:11:35,953 --> 01:11:36,899
We have a call.

1188
01:11:37,059 --> 01:11:38,297
- Is it a friendly call?
- It's a friendly call?

1189
01:11:38,383 --> 01:11:40,343
Okay, take it, take it.

1190
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:41,970
Joy, we have a call.

1191
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:43,728
<i>A call? How did that happen?

1192
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:46,808
Well, we have a call!

1193
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:48,429
<i>Hi, Jo Ann from New York.

1194
01:11:48,453 --> 01:11:49,259
Jo Ann from New York!

1195
01:11:49,271 --> 01:11:52,172
We have a call coming in
from Jo Ann from New York.

1196
01:11:52,208 --> 01:11:56,769
<i>Yeah, I'm calling in because I would love a
mop that I don't have to touch when I wring it.

1197
01:11:56,819 --> 01:11:58,857
<i>Ya know, my hands</i> get raw when I...

1198
01:11:58,929 --> 01:12:02,544
mop broken glass, and I wring
the mop, I cut my hands.

1199
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:07,084
<i>Do you ever cut your hands
when you're wringing?

1200
01:12:07,123 --> 01:12:11,910
Jo Ann, that is so funny that you said
that, that is actually exactly how I

1201
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:14,160
was inspired to invent this mop.

1202
01:12:14,196 --> 01:12:18,112
I had... there was glass shattered everywhere,
I was with my 2 kids, with my father,

1203
01:12:18,906 --> 01:12:22,808
and I... every time I would wring the mop,
I would get glass shards in my hand.

1204
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:27,199
<i>and the old mop wasn't
very absorbent, so...

1205
01:12:27,243 --> 01:12:30,178
I... I went to my daughter's room,

1206
01:12:30,212 --> 01:12:34,178
I borrowed her crayons
and I designed this mop.

1207
01:12:34,316 --> 01:12:37,251
- Make sure you get down there, yeah, that's it.
- It's made of plastic, so it is lightweight,

1208
01:12:37,253 --> 01:12:40,324
<i>- but very durable.</i>
- Go in, go into the hands.

1209
01:12:40,374 --> 01:12:43,424
It's extremely absorbent,
with 300 continuous

1210
01:12:43,474 --> 01:12:46,404
cotton loops, that I looped
myself, when I designed it.

1211
01:12:46,454 --> 01:12:47,770
How much is it?

1212
01:12:47,797 --> 01:12:49,721
It is nineteen ninety-five.

1213
01:12:49,771 --> 01:12:51,989
I like that price, I want
a whole bunch of them.

1214
01:12:52,902 --> 01:12:54,286
Thank you.

1215
01:12:54,336 --> 01:12:56,391
H-375, that's the order number.

1216
01:12:56,441 --> 01:13:00,106
Household item 3-75.
I guarantee you...

1217
01:13:00,142 --> 01:13:01,110
- That's it, stay right there.
- You are not going to

1218
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:02,949
<i>- Now! Do it again, hands down,</i>
- find another mop like this that exists

1219
01:13:02,999 --> 01:13:04,483
<i>- Right there, that's good, get the hands.</i>
- If there was, I woulda bought it

1220
01:13:04,527 --> 01:13:06,952
and I woulda, ya know,
cut my hands on it.

1221
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:09,414
<i>You can get across
the whole kitchen,

1222
01:13:09,489 --> 01:13:11,519
with one wring,
just imagine that.

1223
01:13:11,921 --> 01:13:13,227
<i>Watch this.

1224
01:13:14,190 --> 01:13:16,158
Chocolate syrup.

1225
01:13:18,127 --> 01:13:19,241
Go to the syrup,
go to the syrup.

1226
01:13:19,291 --> 01:13:22,096
Baby food, a very big spill...
at my house.

1227
01:13:22,131 --> 01:13:25,629
- A very common spill for me.
- Hands, hands.

1228
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:27,135
Now, the biggest difference,

1229
01:13:27,335 --> 01:13:29,670
I don't have to touch
this disgusting mop head.

1230
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:32,247
There's not another mop on the market

1231
01:13:32,297 --> 01:13:36,191
that has as much absorbent
cotton as this mop right here.

1232
01:13:36,241 --> 01:13:39,297
And I guarantee you,
there will be no regrets,

1233
01:13:39,367 --> 01:13:44,000
no returns... I have been<i> mopping for
most of my life, every single day...

1234
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:44,796
The phones are ringing!

1235
01:13:44,896 --> 01:13:46,863
I cannot tell you how much
this mop has changed my life.

1236
01:13:46,913 --> 01:13:48,122
<i>- The phones are ringing!</i>
- The phones are ringing.

1237
01:13:48,224 --> 01:13:50,155
<i>- The phones are ringing.
- The phones are ringing.

1238
01:13:50,192 --> 01:13:54,527
<i>It's gonna be the greatest mop to have
around </i>Christmas time when you have family over,

1239
01:13:54,577 --> 01:13:57,197
I can't... I...
I am a mother of two.

1240
01:13:57,233 --> 01:13:59,258
There is just spill after spill,

1241
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:01,133
family comes to town,

1242
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:03,772
you can mop your entire
kitchen with one wring.

1243
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:06,293
<i>Oh! My God!</i> 29,000!

1244
01:14:07,142 --> 01:14:08,545
<i>This is very special!

1245
01:14:08,595 --> 01:14:11,248
I haven't even told you about
my personal, favorite feature,

1246
01:14:11,513 --> 01:14:13,323
which is the
removable mop head.

1247
01:14:13,373 --> 01:14:15,607
that I can put into
the washing machine,

1248
01:14:15,807 --> 01:14:18,511
and it will come
out clean as new.

1249
01:14:18,561 --> 01:14:19,922
Yes! Yes!

1250
01:14:20,089 --> 01:14:23,158
Oh, my God,
these numbers keep climbing.

1251
01:14:23,259 --> 01:14:25,022
Thank you, I...
I... I...

1252
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:27,440
<i>Yes! That's how you keep it going.</i>
- Thank you.

1253
01:14:28,230 --> 01:14:30,255
<i>The is the most
absorbent mop on the market,

1254
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:33,337
It's lightweight, it's the
only mop you're ever gonna buy,

1255
01:14:33,387 --> 01:14:34,725
the best mop you're
ever gonna use,

1256
01:14:34,813 --> 01:14:39,513
it is lightweight, and durable and that
is just me speaking from my experience...

1257
01:14:39,563 --> 01:14:43,449
as someone who mops the house every,
single day... from my heart.

1258
01:14:44,647 --> 01:14:47,277
This woman's gonna
be all business.

1259
01:14:49,852 --> 01:14:51,280
No way.

1260
01:14:56,249 --> 01:14:57,963
Oh, my God!

1261
01:15:16,946 --> 01:15:19,075
I can't believe it!

1262
01:15:20,049 --> 01:15:21,194
Can you believe it?

1263
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:24,768
I thought for sure you were gonna tell
me that your counting machine was broken!

1264
01:15:25,154 --> 01:15:28,187
- I listened to you, you were right.
I just can't believe...

1265
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:30,162
- that actually happened.
- I know.

1266
01:15:30,259 --> 01:15:32,537
I guess you could say we're
friends in the commerce.

1267
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:35,193
- Friends in commerce.
- Yeah.

1268
01:15:35,278 --> 01:15:37,579
So, let's promise each other,
that if one day,

1269
01:15:37,629 --> 01:15:42,077
and that day may come, that we become
adversaries in commerce, that we remain friends.

1270
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:44,283
That's a true friendship,
indeed.

1271
01:15:44,333 --> 01:15:45,953
Friends in commerce.

1272
01:15:46,241 --> 01:15:48,585
I agree, let's shake on it.

1273
01:16:28,951 --> 01:16:34,604
We've got 10 looms, and then when they're
completed this is where the mop heads are sewn.

1274
01:16:36,759 --> 01:16:40,242
- Who makes your parts?
- A factory out in California.

1275
01:16:40,295 --> 01:16:43,162
It is cheaper and faster
than anyplace around here.

1276
01:16:43,198 --> 01:16:45,314
Smart!
Are they gonna be able to stay on-schedule?

1277
01:16:46,201 --> 01:16:47,919
I hope... yeah.

1278
01:17:15,831 --> 01:17:17,090
- That's a great job.
- Thank you.

1279
01:17:17,140 --> 01:17:18,698
- You're welcome.
- Right here?

1280
01:17:20,169 --> 01:17:21,295
Hello?

1281
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:23,555
Grandma...

1282
01:18:26,235 --> 01:18:27,622
Mimi...

1283
01:18:42,117 --> 01:18:44,731
<i>I so hated to
leave her that day.

1284
01:18:45,954 --> 01:18:49,091
<i>I had so much I
wanted to say to her...

1285
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:51,725
<i>and to my great-granddaughter.

1286
01:18:54,229 --> 01:19:00,108
<i>I felt I wanted to stay
near her and watch over her.

1287
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,165
Christie.

1288
01:20:13,241 --> 01:20:15,050
There's a problem
in California.

1289
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:19,074
There can't be a problem in California,
I told Neil that everything was fine.

1290
01:20:19,281 --> 01:20:24,124
Gerhardt keeps rising his prices,
he just did it again... more money per unit.

1291
01:20:25,153 --> 01:20:27,181
I can't do that
without losing money.

1292
01:20:27,231 --> 01:20:29,233
I sent a representative
to handle it.

1293
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:33,690
Representative? We don't have a
representative, what representative?

1294
01:20:34,563 --> 01:20:37,136
- Peggy went.
- Peggy?

1295
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:43,992
I don't wanna talk
about this right now.

1296
01:20:52,581 --> 01:20:55,828
<i>- She wanted to be part of it.</i>
- How could you send Peggy?

1297
01:21:00,656 --> 01:21:07,050
<i>She wanted to be part of it, you are both
blood relatives, you're half sisters,

1298
01:21:07,295 --> 01:21:11,998
<i>it's very, very important that
you love and respect each other.

1299
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:18,798
I paid them the 20 that
you owed them... I had to.

1300
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:22,986
I got them to fill
the order of 100,000

1301
01:21:23,486 --> 01:21:26,072
with a price increase of
only two dollars per unit.

1302
01:21:26,114 --> 01:21:30,848
We can't increase at all,
Peggy, don't you understand?

1303
01:21:33,221 --> 01:21:36,122
We sold at a certain price.

1304
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:40,265
Any hikes, ESPECIALLY
the ones he's asking for,

1305
01:21:40,429 --> 01:21:42,605
mean that I will
lose so much money

1306
01:21:42,654 --> 01:21:46,950
that I will be in even MORE
debt than I was before.

1307
01:21:49,171 --> 01:21:53,714
- You're gonna make it back.
- I'm gonna make it back?

1308
01:21:54,276 --> 01:21:56,244
How?

1309
01:22:00,315 --> 01:22:03,375
I've got ideas, you know?

1310
01:22:05,053 --> 01:22:07,249
There are things
I'd like to do.

1311
01:22:07,299 --> 01:22:12,053
I spoke to him about a project that Dad
and I have been designing. Right, Dad?

1312
01:22:12,103 --> 01:22:13,855
Yes we did it.

1313
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:20,072
Do you have and idea how
much your idea will cost?

1314
01:22:21,103 --> 01:22:22,759
How or where
you'll sell it?

1315
01:22:23,271 --> 01:22:26,737
If you could even manufacture it,
after it's taken everything we're got

1316
01:22:26,809 --> 01:22:29,061
to sell this one product,
that now, thanks to you,

1317
01:22:30,237 --> 01:22:32,938
that is going to
cost more money?

1318
01:22:33,181 --> 01:22:36,031
Maybe my product is
better than your product.

1319
01:22:36,118 --> 01:22:37,979
I can do what you did on TV,
it's not that hard.

1320
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:42,435
Isn't that the whole purpose of that channel,
is that everybody could do it?

1321
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:47,437
What... what...
what your sister does is...

1322
01:22:47,529 --> 01:22:51,185
not easy, but,
what we were planning to do...

1323
01:22:52,594 --> 01:22:58,413
- is not that difficult.
- Listen me.

1324
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:05,475
Never... speak...
on my behalf...

1325
01:23:07,716 --> 01:23:11,615
about my business... again.

1326
01:23:13,255 --> 01:23:15,858
Now I have to go
to California.

1327
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:20,199
- Can I help you?
- I'm Joy, I'm here to see Gerhardt.

1328
01:24:20,956 --> 01:24:25,252
- He's not available.
- I'll wait.

1329
01:24:28,163 --> 01:24:30,706
She says she's here
to see Gerhardt.

1330
01:24:31,733 --> 01:24:33,144
<i>Gerhardt!

1331
01:24:40,108 --> 01:24:43,896
- Hey... I'm Gerhardt.
- I'm Joy.

1332
01:24:44,179 --> 01:24:45,093
C'mon in.

1333
01:24:45,547 --> 01:24:48,220
Derek Markham is my boss,
he lives in Texas.

1334
01:24:48,270 --> 01:24:52,542
Fabri-Pac is one of the several companies
he owns or collects royalties for.

1335
01:24:52,688 --> 01:24:56,029
I report to him,
he makes pricing decisions.

1336
01:24:56,291 --> 01:24:59,261
I have never met or talked
to this Derek Markham.

1337
01:24:59,311 --> 01:25:01,024
but I've talked to you
many times on the phone,

1338
01:25:01,062 --> 01:25:02,786
and I do find it very curious that

1339
01:25:02,986 --> 01:25:05,656
the second I'm on television
with a lot of success,

1340
01:25:05,701 --> 01:25:07,993
the price of our
products goes up.

1341
01:25:08,152 --> 01:25:10,804
It seems very unfair to me,
to say the least.

1342
01:25:11,707 --> 01:25:13,898
It seems like he's
shaking us down.

1343
01:25:14,169 --> 01:25:16,301
You met Gregory,
our plant foreman.

1344
01:25:16,544 --> 01:25:19,313
<i>It's very hard for us to
lower the costs at this point.

1345
01:25:19,314 --> 01:25:21,713
We are already losing
a lot of money.

1346
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:25,143
How can that possibly be with
the 500,000 we've given you

1347
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:29,054
on TOP of the 50,000 in advanced
royalties that have gone to...

1348
01:25:29,057 --> 01:25:30,290
Derek Markham in Dallas.

1349
01:25:30,340 --> 01:25:32,504
And that's not even
counting what my sister

1350
01:25:32,518 --> 01:25:34,470
paid you without my authority,
by the way.

1351
01:25:34,563 --> 01:25:37,073
For your over-charges
and YOUR mistakes.

1352
01:25:37,999 --> 01:25:41,801
Your sister paid the increase,
that you refused to pay.

1353
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:46,047
Well, she had no authority to do that,
she is not an officer of my corporation.

1354
01:25:46,842 --> 01:25:50,036
But you and I both could spend a
lot of time and money in court,

1355
01:25:50,278 --> 01:25:52,442
to prove I'm right, but...

1356
01:25:52,581 --> 01:25:54,161
that would just make
our lawyers wealthy,

1357
01:25:54,185 --> 01:25:59,018
while my product dies instead of being on
television, like it could be right now.

1358
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:03,290
- You can pay more.
- I can't pay more.

1359
01:26:04,192 --> 01:26:06,045
- I won't.
<i>- Costs are higher.

1360
01:26:06,061 --> 01:26:09,491
<i>Wear and tear on the molds, we have
to re-make them every other week.

1361
01:26:09,831 --> 01:26:12,808
Is that so?
Can I see the molds?

1362
01:26:12,901 --> 01:26:14,278
<i>They're in the machines,

1363
01:26:14,302 --> 01:26:17,417
it'll take some time
to prepare them for ya.

1364
01:26:21,943 --> 01:26:23,997
Is there a
bathroom I can use?

1365
01:26:27,282 --> 01:26:29,656
Yeah, it's down the hall,
<i>Gregory'll show ya.

1366
01:26:37,826 --> 01:26:39,372
Thanks.

1367
01:27:59,891 --> 01:28:01,200
What's this?

1368
01:28:04,713 --> 01:28:06,482
What are you doin'
in here?

1369
01:28:07,215 --> 01:28:11,584
What is THIS? These are my
designs! These are MY molds!

1370
01:28:11,653 --> 01:28:14,026
Those are ours!
We knew you'd be trouble!

1371
01:28:14,149 --> 01:28:15,088
The cops are on their way,

1372
01:28:15,112 --> 01:28:17,017
<i>- we called them as soon as...<i>
- These are MY molds!

1373
01:28:17,225 --> 01:28:20,218
<i>- Those are ours!</i>
- I'm taking these with me!

1374
01:28:20,529 --> 01:28:24,496
I'm taking all of these with me, I want all
these boxes out and I'm taking them.

1375
01:28:24,546 --> 01:28:27,046
- You're trespassing!
<i>- It's not your patent!

1376
01:28:27,268 --> 01:28:29,152
These are my designs!

1377
01:28:30,672 --> 01:28:32,554
<i>I'm not going anywhere
without my molds!

1378
01:28:34,209 --> 01:28:37,957
What? No, no, this is not stealing,
this is MY property.

1379
01:28:38,179 --> 01:28:42,638
This is MY property, I have all of these
designs, these are all mine, they belong to me.

1380
01:28:42,688 --> 01:28:46,245
<i>She's from out of state, John.
You've known me 15 years!

1381
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:48,527
All right, c'mon, Ma'am,
you're trespassing.

1382
01:28:48,724 --> 01:28:51,476
- It's okay, Ma'am.
- I'm not trespassing.

1383
01:28:51,526 --> 01:28:52,822
- You're trespassing.
- I was in your office!

1384
01:28:52,872 --> 01:28:54,172
- I don't know, c'mon.
- He let me in his...

1385
01:28:54,563 --> 01:28:55,966
Gerhardt, you're not
gonna get away with this.

1386
01:28:56,226 --> 01:28:58,306
- You're not gonna get away with this, you're a thief!
- Be careful what you're saying.

1387
01:28:58,330 --> 01:29:01,064
- You're a thief, Gerhardt!
- Be careful...

1388
01:29:01,136 --> 01:29:04,105
- This is stealing!
- Lady, stop it.

1389
01:29:17,252 --> 01:29:20,863
<i>What about Trudy's money, Joy?
You have to pay back Trudy's money.

1390
01:29:21,156 --> 01:29:24,677
- This is only getting worse.
- I predicted tragedy, Joy.

1391
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:30,255
<i>You're racking-up quite a steep bill,
we had to fly out here, bail you out.

1392
01:29:30,265 --> 01:29:33,163
<i>Plus, it cost us an extra
10,000 dollars for Ray Cagney,

1393
01:29:33,213 --> 01:29:36,161
<i>this California patent
attorney to get us to this point.

1394
01:29:36,204 --> 01:29:38,551
<i>We got the State to
decline prosecution.

1395
01:29:38,609 --> 01:29:40,510
<i>They see it's a
contract dispute.

1396
01:29:41,176 --> 01:29:44,168
<i>When you paid royalties
to Derek Markham in Texas,

1397
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:48,950
it put all YOUR parts and molds
under the umbrella of THEIR patent.

1398
01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:52,461
<i>I see you brought your drawings
and hung them to prove your designs.

1399
01:29:52,511 --> 01:29:55,317
But, it's impossible to fight it now.

1400
01:29:55,590 --> 01:29:57,963
<i>You were not
properly advised.

1401
01:29:59,027 --> 01:30:00,944
Christie, please!

1402
01:30:01,196 --> 01:30:04,207
- Tony, take her to bed.
- I don't wanna go to bed, I wanna stay here.

1403
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:09,870
<i>I paid those royalties</i> because you told
me to, because YOUR lawyer told me to.

1404
01:30:09,971 --> 01:30:13,729
<i>Our lawyer was mistaken,
this happens sometimes in business.

1405
01:30:14,175 --> 01:30:15,264
It didn't work for you.

1406
01:30:15,314 --> 01:30:18,067
It happens sometimes,
Trudy's lawyer's not a patent attorney.

1407
01:30:18,179 --> 01:30:23,766
Which I said! And you said I had
no business being Joy's adviser.

1408
01:30:24,052 --> 01:30:25,792
- And now it turns out that I was right...
- This is not helping, Tony!

1409
01:30:25,876 --> 01:30:27,854
- That's enough, Tony, please.
- It's enough now?

1410
01:30:27,889 --> 01:30:30,446
<i>I'm very sorry,
I wish there was more I could do.

1411
01:30:30,559 --> 01:30:35,596
<i>But when your sister, Peggy, paid
unjustified bills that you refused to pay...

1412
01:30:35,664 --> 01:30:37,191
<i>it closed the door on that.

1413
01:30:37,241 --> 01:30:39,220
What about Neil Walker and QVC?

1414
01:30:39,270 --> 01:30:41,771
Wouldn't they pay the expenses
on defending the patent?

1415
01:30:42,096 --> 01:30:45,262
Be careful, Joy, you could be
sued for misrepresentation,

1416
01:30:45,306 --> 01:30:48,942
and failure to deliver your
product, that's breach.

1417
01:30:49,244 --> 01:30:52,671
QVC requires that you deliver
a fully patented product.

1418
01:30:52,681 --> 01:30:57,506
<i>I've been doing this for a long time,
you're in for a long court process,

1419
01:30:57,586 --> 01:31:00,991
<i>that will stall your product,
you will probably you lose.

1420
01:31:01,075 --> 01:31:03,251
<i>I wish I could do more.

1421
01:31:04,192 --> 01:31:05,439
Take care now.

1422
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:08,131
You're gonna have to
check the facts, Joy.

1423
01:31:10,063 --> 01:31:12,063
You're almost over half a
million dollars in debt,

1424
01:31:12,113 --> 01:31:14,019
I don't know how
you're gonna pay it.

1425
01:31:14,269 --> 01:31:18,226
<i>We have to declare bankruptcy.
YOU'RE gonna have to declare bankruptcy.

1426
01:31:19,173 --> 01:31:21,266
- I have to declare bankruptcy.
- She has to.

1427
01:31:21,309 --> 01:31:23,174
- To try to contain my losses.
- Yeah.

1428
01:31:23,211 --> 01:31:26,260
- I have to write it off.
- It just seems so wrong.

1429
01:31:26,314 --> 01:31:28,228
We've worked so hard.

1430
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:31,870
We've come so far for us to just
give up now, it just seems so unfair!

1431
01:31:32,186 --> 01:31:34,580
Business is unfair,
that's it.

1432
01:31:34,732 --> 01:31:37,029
It's not working out,
well, that's what happens.

1433
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:40,293
That's why people don't go around
making an invention every other day.

1434
01:31:41,129 --> 01:31:41,868
Now, wake up!

1435
01:31:41,964 --> 01:31:46,124
It's my fault, I gave her the confidence to
think she was more than an unemployed housewife,

1436
01:31:46,167 --> 01:31:48,936
selling plastic kitchen stuff
to other unemployed housewives

1437
01:31:48,970 --> 01:31:52,987
on a junk cable channel.
It's my fault, it's not your fault, Honey.

1438
01:31:53,007 --> 01:31:55,776
It was my mistake to make her
think she was more than she was.

1439
01:31:56,110 --> 01:31:58,837
<i>She pressured herself into doing
something she shouldn't have done.

1440
01:31:58,913 --> 01:32:00,846
And it was wrong of you to put that
pressure on yourself.

1441
01:32:00,949 --> 01:32:03,104
It was wrong of us put
that pressure on you.

1442
01:32:03,284 --> 01:32:04,705
I need more vodka.

1443
01:32:05,186 --> 01:32:10,691
It was wrong of us to think that you'd
be an INSTANT business person overnight.

1444
01:32:10,792 --> 01:32:12,608
Of course,
this is not who you are!

1445
01:32:14,228 --> 01:32:21,613
It takes a kind of toughness, a
certain acumen that you simply don't have.

1446
01:32:22,937 --> 01:32:24,583
Sign the paper.

1447
01:32:28,810 --> 01:32:31,071
<i>You have to sign these
bankruptcy papers, Honey.

1448
01:32:31,179 --> 01:32:34,016
The notary's right outside,
let me get her.

1449
01:32:37,852 --> 01:32:40,247
You're gonna have to move out of
your house immediately.

1450
01:32:40,855 --> 01:32:42,976
<i>You're gonna have to move
into to an apartment,

1451
01:32:43,026 --> 01:32:45,285
maybe you can move into
a room in Trudy's house.

1452
01:32:45,493 --> 01:32:47,027
- With the children?
<i>- Yeah.

1453
01:32:47,061 --> 01:32:50,484
<i>You have room, she's
my daughter, why not?

1454
01:32:51,099 --> 01:32:52,956
Well, let's talk about it.

1455
01:32:53,668 --> 01:32:58,164
<i>- Trudy, we have to offer her something.
- Again? Why me?

1456
01:33:33,341 --> 01:33:35,312
<i>Thank you.

1457
01:33:38,279 --> 01:33:42,600
Mimi said that you were the one
born to help carry us on to success.

1458
01:33:46,220 --> 01:33:49,800
No, Christie, Mimi was wrong.

1459
01:33:50,218 --> 01:33:55,724
The world does not GIVE you opportunities,
the world destroys opportunities.

1460
01:33:55,763 --> 01:33:57,667
It breaks your heart.

1461
01:33:58,299 --> 01:34:01,933
<i>I should have listened to my mother,
when I was 10 years old.

1462
01:34:02,003 --> 01:34:07,577
<i>I should have spent the rest of my life</i> watching
TV and hiding the world like my mother.

1463
01:34:07,609 --> 01:34:09,985
So I don't want
hear anymore about Mimi.

1464
01:34:10,879 --> 01:34:13,955
She was wrong,
she had her head in the clouds,

1465
01:34:14,005 --> 01:34:18,244
and it was full of stupid ideas,
and it gave me stupid ideas.

1466
01:34:20,321 --> 01:34:22,087
But this?

1467
01:34:24,258 --> 01:34:27,612
This stupid, stupid idea!

1468
01:34:29,297 --> 01:34:33,036
<i>Mommy, don't tear them, no!

1469
01:34:53,588 --> 01:34:56,144
Christie, I'm sorry.

1470
01:34:56,257 --> 01:35:00,170
<i>Christie, I'm so sorry.

1471
01:35:00,220 --> 01:35:03,632
Please, go to bed,
everybody, just go to bed.

1472
01:35:04,131 --> 01:35:07,852
- Goodnight, Mommie.
<i>- Good night, Sweetheart, go to bed.

1473
01:35:10,304 --> 01:35:15,207
<i>- I'm so sorry I failed you, Joy, I'm so sorry.
- Please, just go.

1474
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:54,052
Joy? Joy? Joy, where are you?
Joy, where are you?

1475
01:38:08,082 --> 01:38:09,991
It's open.

1476
01:38:17,291 --> 01:38:19,160
You can leave the door open.

1477
01:38:44,686 --> 01:38:46,717
<i>No one knows I'm here.

1478
01:38:47,922 --> 01:38:50,052
You don't even
know who I am.

1479
01:38:50,124 --> 01:38:55,864
I could be Derek Markham, or I might be
someone Derek Markham sent to handle you.

1480
01:38:56,130 --> 01:38:57,526
You have no case.

1481
01:38:58,437 --> 01:39:02,262
<i>Maybe people think you came to Dallas
in despair to take your own life

1482
01:39:02,303 --> 01:39:07,265
<i>because you were in such deep financial
trouble suddenly from your little venture.

1483
01:39:13,948 --> 01:39:17,087
I made a phone call this
morning to Hong Kong.

1484
01:39:18,219 --> 01:39:22,956
<i>It was 3 a.m. in California, but it was
3</i> p.m. the following afternoon in Hong Kong.

1485
01:39:22,990 --> 01:39:25,215
I always think it's amazing...

1486
01:39:26,127 --> 01:39:28,106
how time works like that.

1487
01:39:29,063 --> 01:39:32,515
<i>But I was fortunate enough to get on
the phone with Mister Christopher,

1488
01:39:32,615 --> 01:39:34,965
who I found to be very friendly.

1489
01:39:35,169 --> 01:39:37,187
Which was surprising, because I
really haven't found the gentlemen

1490
01:39:37,287 --> 01:39:41,876
in California to be very nice,
considering we're all in business together.

1491
01:39:42,109 --> 01:39:45,100
<i>Welcome to the world
of business, I guess.

1492
01:39:46,280 --> 01:39:50,685
I told Mister Christopher that reason that
I was calling was to discuss the differences

1493
01:39:50,885 --> 01:39:52,803
in designs our products.

1494
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:56,326
But I quickly learned
that Mister Christopher

1495
01:39:56,429 --> 01:40:01,498
has no IDEA that his Hong Kong
patent for a self wringing mop

1496
01:40:01,562 --> 01:40:03,870
is worth anything or if it even WORKS.

1497
01:40:04,732 --> 01:40:09,706
Because they have not
made or sold a single mop.

1498
01:40:10,237 --> 01:40:13,727
Unlike us,
who have sold over 200,000.

1499
01:40:15,209 --> 01:40:19,553
And I've paid YOU over 50,000
dollars in advanced royalties

1500
01:40:19,603 --> 01:40:22,074
on behalf of Mister Christopher.

1501
01:40:22,316 --> 01:40:25,610
Blood money
from my family,

1502
01:40:25,820 --> 01:40:27,868
and my second mortgage.

1503
01:40:28,456 --> 01:40:32,575
<i>It turns out Mister Christopher didn't
know anything about those royalties.

1504
01:40:33,194 --> 01:40:40,135
<i>So it seems...</i> we have a
case of fraud and embezzlement.

1505
01:40:42,269 --> 01:40:45,270
And... as if that
weren't bad enough,

1506
01:40:46,073 --> 01:40:49,439
I also discovered in the
paperwork that our mops

1507
01:40:49,539 --> 01:40:51,843
actually don't bear
any similarities.

1508
01:40:51,946 --> 01:40:55,054
So, I never DID owe you any
royalties for your patent.

1509
01:40:56,250 --> 01:40:58,380
<i>That's another case of fraud.

1510
01:40:59,098 --> 01:41:01,274
<i>My lawyers could
really go after you.

1511
01:41:01,789 --> 01:41:04,979
<i>But I told them, "Give me a day."

1512
01:41:05,192 --> 01:41:11,590
To see if maybe, you
might have made a mistake.

1513
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:15,746
And you would correct,
given the chance.

1514
01:41:31,285 --> 01:41:34,078
<i>We'll pay you back all
the royalties you paid us.

1515
01:41:38,192 --> 01:41:43,641
I can pay you... give you 20,000
on top of paying you back the 50.

1516
01:41:55,910 --> 01:41:57,560
<i>Okay?

1517
01:41:58,279 --> 01:42:01,985
I'll give you 50,000 on top
of paying you back the 50...

1518
01:42:14,195 --> 01:42:16,940
Plus interest.

1519
01:42:21,769 --> 01:42:27,036
I want all my molds back,
I want you to sign this piece of paper...

1520
01:42:27,642 --> 01:42:31,164
saying that you have
no rights financially.

1521
01:42:32,146 --> 01:42:33,857
I'm just gonna add...

1522
01:42:34,315 --> 01:42:36,215
50...

1523
01:42:38,052 --> 01:42:40,111
50...

1524
01:42:41,255 --> 01:42:44,156
plus interest.

1525
01:42:55,102 --> 01:42:57,070
Sign here.

1526
01:43:03,478 --> 01:43:06,308
<i>She'd put up with
just about anything...

1527
01:43:07,047 --> 01:43:09,991
<i>until when she had to
bring the hammer down.

1528
01:43:11,218 --> 01:43:13,509
<i>She brought the hammer down.

1529
01:43:15,289 --> 01:43:17,910
<i>She couldn't know
what was to come.

1530
01:43:18,793 --> 01:43:22,963
<i>That she'd go on to make
another 100 record settin' patents.

1531
01:43:23,831 --> 01:43:27,205
<i>Skinny velvet hangers
make neater closets.

1532
01:43:27,237 --> 01:43:29,731
<i>That's a big deal
for a lot of people.

1533
01:43:31,205 --> 01:43:34,425
<i>I mean,
who thinks up things like that?

1534
01:43:34,775 --> 01:43:36,235
<i>Joy did.

1535
01:43:40,247 --> 01:43:45,855
<i>But she didn't know any of this would
happen as she walked that day in Dallas.

1536
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:50,406
<i>Yes, Sir, tonight's the night, folks,
Saint Nick'll make his yearly visit

1537
01:43:50,456 --> 01:43:52,315
<i>to all the folks all over the world.

1538
01:43:52,426 --> 01:43:55,872
<i>There's fun and expectation
in every house across the land.

1539
01:43:55,922 --> 01:44:00,076
<i>And speaking of houses, what do you say
we take a little look in on a typical one.

1540
01:44:03,237 --> 01:44:07,723
<i>Now, I'll admit that what you see right now is
just a small piece of the of the front of the house.

1541
01:44:09,109 --> 01:44:10,309
<i>For all you grown-ups
and kiddies alike,

1542
01:44:10,363 --> 01:44:16,242
<i>This is the time of Santa's magic, so,
I think we can make it become a real house.

1543
01:44:17,117 --> 01:44:18,213
<i>Even the house with love in it.

1544
01:44:18,301 --> 01:44:20,980
<i>Mister Santa Claus,
can we have a little snow, please?

1545
01:44:23,758 --> 01:44:25,452
<i>Thank you, that's fine.

1546
01:44:25,893 --> 01:44:29,487
<i>Now, Santa, let me see what it
really looks like inside this house.

1547
01:44:44,078 --> 01:44:47,206
<i>♫ A house with love in it ♫

1548
01:44:48,315 --> 01:44:51,812
<i>♫ Is rich indeed. ♫

1549
01:44:51,919 --> 01:44:56,046
<i>♫ Although there are a thousand things ♫

1550
01:44:56,090 --> 01:44:58,857
<i>♫ that house may need ♫

1551
01:44:58,893 --> 01:45:03,844
<i>She couldn't know that one day she
would move into a big, beautiful home.

1552
01:45:03,894 --> 01:45:06,041
<i>♫ A roof so plain and bare. ♫

1553
01:45:06,133 --> 01:45:08,850
<i>Her mother was... happy.

1554
01:45:09,036 --> 01:45:13,694
<i>She remained close to her,
and with the rest of her family...

1555
01:45:13,774 --> 01:45:17,202
<i>which was,
as always, complicated.

1556
01:45:18,546 --> 01:45:23,461
<i>She would pay for products
made by Rudy, Trudy, and Peggy...

1557
01:45:24,151 --> 01:45:26,027
<i>even when they failed,

1558
01:45:26,907 --> 01:45:31,123
<i>even when they wrongly sued
for ownership of her company.

1559
01:45:32,259 --> 01:45:37,839
<i>As Rudy got older, Joy continued
to take care of him and love him.

1560
01:45:42,970 --> 01:45:48,800
<i>As Neil Walker predicted,
Joy did become a whole, new business,

1561
01:45:49,109 --> 01:45:51,397
<i>And even out-grew QVC.

1562
01:45:51,447 --> 01:45:53,111
- Is talking...
- Is Tony there?

1563
01:45:53,305 --> 01:45:54,688
Yeah, Tony's in there,
the whole family's in there.

1564
01:45:54,738 --> 01:46:01,153
<i>Her ex-husband and her best friend
would remain her steadfast advisers.

1565
01:46:01,188 --> 01:46:02,915
Please be patient.

1566
01:46:08,195 --> 01:46:09,616
I love you.

1567
01:46:10,030 --> 01:46:12,096
- Good night mom.
- I love you.

1568
01:46:13,989 --> 01:46:16,359
- I love you, too, Papa
- I love you guys.

1569
01:46:21,208 --> 01:46:22,300
- Hi.
- Hi.

1570
01:46:22,309 --> 01:46:24,481
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

1571
01:46:27,014 --> 01:46:27,938
What do you have?

1572
01:46:27,982 --> 01:46:31,277
- A traveling clothes cleaner.
- Let's see it.

1573
01:46:32,119 --> 01:46:34,443
<i>- So, you're from Memphis?</i>
Yes, I am.

1574
01:46:34,655 --> 01:46:36,933
<i>- You work as a waitress?</i>
- Yes, ma'am.

1575
01:46:36,991 --> 01:46:41,057
<i>All right...
let's see it.

1576
01:46:41,528 --> 01:46:44,195
- You made this yourself?
- Yes, I did, Ma'am.

1577
01:46:44,565 --> 01:46:47,063
I made my first invention myself, too.

1578
01:46:48,268 --> 01:46:50,287
I like this,
a very good design.

1579
01:46:50,738 --> 01:46:51,313
<i>Thank you.

1580
01:46:51,588 --> 01:46:54,170
Can you stay an extra day,
maybe see our designers?

1581
01:46:55,175 --> 01:46:57,200
No, because of your boss.

1582
01:46:57,878 --> 01:46:59,577
What hotel are you
staying in right now?

1583
01:46:59,647 --> 01:47:00,638
<i>At the Holiday Inn, Ma'am.

1584
01:47:00,714 --> 01:47:02,922
The Holiday Inn?
Let's move them over to the Radisson,

1585
01:47:02,983 --> 01:47:05,298
get them a suite, they'll be more
comfortable with their baby.

1586
01:47:05,344 --> 01:47:07,163
I'll call your boss and
get it taken care of,

1587
01:47:07,228 --> 01:47:10,018
give you an extra day so that tomorrow
you can come in, meet with the designers,

1588
01:47:10,068 --> 01:47:12,523
<i>- Get tickets, stuff like that, right?</i>
- I get to do that?

1589
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:14,288
<i>We'll work on the idea,
see if we can do something.

1590
01:47:14,328 --> 01:47:16,250
<i>This means so much to me.

1591
01:47:16,464 --> 01:47:18,250
I know what it feels like.

1592
01:47:18,566 --> 01:47:20,664
I know what it feels
like to be in that chair.

1593
01:47:21,301 --> 01:47:23,304
- We'll see you tomorrow, okay?
- Thank you.

1594
01:47:23,354 --> 01:47:25,586
- And good luck.
- C'mon, Sweetie.

1595
01:47:26,106 --> 01:47:29,075
<i>- Thank you.</i>
- Go get the next...

1596
01:47:29,777 --> 01:47:31,169
Neil.

1597
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:35,314
Sorry, we have legal
stuff to bury now.

1598
01:47:38,218 --> 01:47:40,152
<i>Yes, we do.

1599
01:47:41,221 --> 01:47:44,810
- Here we are.
- Here we are.

1600
01:47:45,392 --> 01:47:50,663
- Adversaries in commerce.
- Adversaries in commerce.

1601
01:47:51,932 --> 01:47:55,455
- And friends.
- Hum! And friends.

1602
01:47:56,537 --> 01:47:59,232
I'm gonna tell you somethin',
but you didn't hear it from me.

1603
01:47:59,273 --> 01:48:01,731
I don't know WHO you are or
WHAT you're talkin' about.

1604
01:48:01,775 --> 01:48:03,416
<i>That's what I wanted to hear.

1605
01:48:05,212 --> 01:48:06,929
Barry's gonna come
after you hard.

1606
01:48:07,247 --> 01:48:10,878
But that's just business, that's
the way Barry is, he's a negotiator.

1607
01:48:10,918 --> 01:48:16,087
Ultimately he needs you,
he's buying HSN.

1608
01:48:16,290 --> 01:48:20,350
It's ALL about HSN now, and
he wants you to come with him.

1609
01:48:22,262 --> 01:48:26,635
<i>He needs you...
You're gonna be really big over there.

1610
01:48:27,331 --> 01:48:30,457
<i>That's what's gonna happen.
But...

1611
01:48:30,507 --> 01:48:32,671
<i>you didn't hear from me, right?

1612
01:48:32,840 --> 01:48:37,596
No... I sure didn't.
But thank you.

1613
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:44,783
- Nice to see you.
- It's good to see you.

1614
01:48:46,186 --> 01:48:50,114
- I'll see you later, Bud.
- Yeah.

1615
01:48:57,798 --> 01:48:59,899

<i>- Yes, it has.

1616

<i>This right here,
this is a special power.

1618
01:49:42,175 --> 01:49:45,008
<i>This is a special power.

1619
01:49:48,515 --> 01:49:52,274
<i>And then I started to
build my very own house,

1620
01:49:53,041 --> 01:49:56,568
<i>where I would live and
make a wonderful creation,

1621
01:49:56,733 --> 01:49:59,562
<i>for all of the world
to see and love.

1622
01:50:05,193 --> 01:50:11,484

happen, as she walked that day.
