I do not feel they're
my responsibility or concern.

00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,713
I believe that the DIA itself
should handle this problem.

00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,509
Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

00:21:36,761 --> 00:21:39,129
The house is right there,
past all the trees.

through there?

give me a hand with some of the

Sure.

You mean you guys are planning on
spending the night up here?

Well, if that's the plan,
you can count me out.

to come up here all the time.

coming inside this place.

Don't you think if somebody lived here,

467
00:26:33,624 --> 00:26:34,924
they'd have chased us out by now?

468
00:26:34,992 --> 00:26:37,827
Well, maybe they went out and
haven't come home yet.

469

eating this stuff.

and not to mention all the other...

all this health crap, Mr. Jack LaLanne?

for miles.

Sheriff Holt, come in please.</i>

00:27:26,944 --> 00:27:29,646
This is Sheriff Holt.

<i>I hate to disturb  your dinner, Sheriff,</i>

484
00:27:32,249 --> 00:27:36,553
<i>but we got another call for trespassers
at the old Romero house.</i>

485
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:38,221
Another one?

486
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:40,824
Those damn kids never learn, do they?

487
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:44,428
<i>No, sir.</i>

488
00:27:44,495 --> 00:27:47,931
Hey, any idea who keeps
calling these in?

489
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:50,099
<i>No, sir.</i>

490
00:27:50,167 --> 00:27:51,868
<i>It sounded like the same person</i>

491
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:55,539
<i>who calls every time  some kid
steps foot on property.</i>

492
00:27:55,606 --> 00:27:57,607
<i>But I still can't figure out
who it might be.</i>

493
00:27:58,342 --> 00:28:00,343
Yeah. Well, me neither.

"Me neither."

00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:11,320
Oh, well. I guess we'll go over there
as soon as we finish eating.

00:28:13,657 --> 00:28:15,592
Are we gonna roll on that call now?
What if it's serious?

499
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:17,961
No, no, no, no, no, no!

500
00:28:18,028 --> 00:28:19,629
Twice a month this happens.

501
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:21,131
Like clockwork.

502
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,666
Bunch of kids nose around,

503
00:28:23,734 --> 00:28:26,603
trying to scare their girlfriends.

504
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,605
They all think it's a spook house.

505
00:28:28,672 --> 00:28:30,273
Hell, if I had a dollar

506
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:33,510
for every drunken, horny teenager
I chased away from that place,

507
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:34,844
I'd be a very rich man.

508
00:28:34,912 --> 00:28:37,547
Hey, look. Here comes a car.

509
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:40,117
Oh, good observation, Einstein.

510
00:28:40,184 --> 00:28:43,786
I might've thought it was a plane,
or maybe a UFO.

511
00:28:43,854 --> 00:28:45,955
I mean, maybe he's speeding.

512
00:28:48,392 --> 00:28:49,759
Go ahead.

513
00:28:51,461 --> 00:28:53,496
I know you're gonna ask me.

514
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,465
Turn on the radar.

515
00:28:58,869 --> 00:29:01,604
I got this one.
-No problem.

516
00:29:01,672 --> 00:29:03,639
Five bucks says he's doing the limit.

517
00:29:03,707 --> 00:29:06,375
You're on.
This one's going at least 70.

518
00:29:06,443 --> 00:29:07,977
Okay.  Here he comes.

519
00:29:08,045 --> 00:29:09,578
Get a bead on them, cowboy.

520
00:29:09,646 --> 00:29:11,781
Oh, oh, oh!
Got 'em. Got 'em.

521
00:29:11,849 --> 00:29:12,882
Oh, oh!  We got 'em.

522
00:29:14,051 --> 00:29:15,719
Oh, look at that! Oh!
Shit.

523
00:29:16,987 --> 00:29:18,221
How the hell did that happen?

525
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,592

Oh, it was real close though.

528

Come on, cough it up.

529
00:29:31,835 --> 00:29:33,836
You're such a stupid shit.

530
00:29:41,378 --> 00:29:43,580
How long till we arrive?

531

00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,558

MARC: So when the guy gets out
of the car.

541
00:30:07,404 --> 00:30:10,640
Being a nice guy, he goes around to
her side of the car

542
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:12,141
to open her door.

543
00:30:12,209 --> 00:30:15,444
But when he gets there,
his eyes bulge!

544
00:30:15,512 --> 00:30:18,014
He tells the girl to stay in the car.

545
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:20,282
Because there, on the door handle,

546
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:24,053
is a shiny, bloody metal hook.

(GROANS) Oh!

548
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:29,058
You see, this Hookman was right there
at the car, ready to open the door

549
00:30:29,126 --> 00:30:31,694
when the guy took off out 
of lover's lane.

is when they went to
call the police

553
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:39,969
and the police finally got there,

554
00:30:40,037 --> 00:30:41,671
the hook was gone.

555
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:45,608
Oh, great.  So this Hookman is still
roaming around someplace?

556
00:30:45,676 --> 00:30:46,909
So they say.

557
00:30:47,511 --> 00:30:48,978
I don't believe it.

Well, I do.

559

Look at all the crazies
out there these days.

560
00:30:52,315 --> 00:30:54,383
I won't be surprised if
some lunatic with a hook

561
00:30:54,451 --> 00:30:55,618
was running around killing people.

about something else?

check this place out.

leave me down there?

00:39:47,951 --> 00:39:51,120
Why haven't you changed the tire?

707
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:53,822
Well, ma'am,
we've been trained in survival skills.

708
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:55,458
Unfortunately, those skills
regard survival

709
00:39:55,525 --> 00:39:57,360
after destruction of a vehicle.

710
00:39:57,427 --> 00:39:59,695
Not repairs or tire changing.

711
00:40:01,464 --> 00:40:06,068
You mean to tell me that neither
of you men have ever changed a tire?

712
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:09,938
BOTH: No, ma'am.

713

Oh, great.

714
00:40:12,942 --> 00:40:16,512
Okay, boys, time
for a training exercise.

715
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:20,750
Let's roll those sleeves up
and pop that trunk open.

716
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:23,185
I can only hope that
our efficient government

717
00:40:23,253 --> 00:40:26,222
has provided this car
with a jack and a spare.

718
00:40:26,289 --> 00:40:30,492
Otherwise, one of you two
is carrying me to our destination.

719
00:40:32,962 --> 00:40:34,429
Yes, ma'am.

720
00:40:40,103 --> 00:40:41,871
Wanna do some exploring of our own?

721
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,372
I'd love to.

722
00:40:45,308 --> 00:40:47,075
Hey, you guys.

723
00:40:47,143 --> 00:40:49,011
We're gonna do a little look around
by ourselves, okay?

724
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:51,080
Yeah, no problem.
-What?

725
00:40:51,147 --> 00:40:53,215

occupied, right?

Don't get any ideas.
-I wasn't getting any ideas.

727

with this guy?

with her crotch.

Well, uh...
Why don't we just take advantage of this.

738
00:41:15,204 --> 00:41:17,573
I mean, check out
the rest of the house.

739
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,142
Don't worry,
I won't do anything you won't let me do.

740
00:41:20,209 --> 00:41:21,443

really pisses me off sometimes.

Let's just go take a walk.

748
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,527
All right.
-All right?

749
00:41:38,594 --> 00:41:40,395
Guess it can't hurt.
-You wanna lead?

750
00:41:40,463 --> 00:41:41,730
No.
-Okay.

751
00:41:43,166 --> 00:41:45,467

All right.

1061
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:23,191
He must be hiding upstairs somewhere,
let's go.

1062
00:59:23,258 --> 00:59:25,192
How'd it get through the funky fireplace?

1063
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:26,627
The floor is
pressure-sensitive.

1064
00:59:26,695 --> 00:59:28,796
We were trying to keep people
from getting in here,

1065
00:59:28,864 --> 00:59:30,297
not leaving.

1066
00:59:32,901 --> 00:59:34,335
I knew that.

1067
00:59:46,382 --> 00:59:47,582
Look.

1068
00:59:49,618 --> 00:59:50,718
Oh.

1069
00:59:51,353 --> 00:59:53,320
It's cold.

1070
00:59:53,388 --> 00:59:56,057
Means it's probably been here a while.

1071
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:57,358

got a little hungry.

1075
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:18,112
Oh, my God.

1076
01:00:18,747 --> 01:00:20,515
Going in. Cover me.

1077
01:00:41,737 --> 01:00:44,639
I think he's dead.

1078
01:00:44,707 --> 01:00:48,909
We're gonna split up.
You check around here, I'm going this way.

1079
01:00:48,977 --> 01:00:51,512
I wouldn't advise that, ma'am.

You're my responsibility at this time

1081
01:00:53,148 --> 01:00:55,383
and I just don't think
it's a good idea.

1082
01:00:55,451 --> 01:00:59,654
You know, Liddy,
I still don't like your attitude.

1083
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:02,590
We can cover a lot more area
if we split up.

1084
01:01:03,892 --> 01:01:04,992

01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:12,500

Intelligence Agency

1158

hangs you up by your balls, mister.

That thing was a menace. Your life
was in danger, I did what was necessary.

1160
01:09:26,227 --> 01:09:27,628
That creature was no menace.

1161
01:09:27,696 --> 01:09:31,832
Didn't you read my report?  
It only killed when it was threatened.

1162
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:34,401
Then how do you explain the boy
killed in the bedroom?

1163
01:09:35,737 --> 01:09:37,338
Pheromones, Liddy.

1164
01:09:37,406 --> 01:09:41,575
The creature was
very receptive to
pheromonal excretions.

1165
01:09:45,647 --> 01:09:46,880
Huh?

1166
01:09:48,783 --> 01:09:52,252
I thought you said
you were briefed.

1167
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:55,222
Well, if you had read my report,

1168
01:09:55,290 --> 01:09:58,425
you would know that every mammal,
including humans,

1169
01:09:58,493 --> 01:10:01,862
excrete pheromones when they're in
an agitated state.

1170
01:10:01,929 --> 01:10:06,133
Fear or sexual arousal emit
the most concentrated form
of pheromones.

1171
01:10:07,302 --> 01:10:08,802
The boy was either
upstairs afraid

1172
01:10:08,870 --> 01:10:11,372
or fooling around
with his girlfriend.

1173
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:14,842
So he was killed
because he was horny.

1174
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:19,379
No. It was receptive
to the scent of sexual arousal

1175
01:10:19,447 --> 01:10:22,382
which is the same scent as fear.

1176
01:10:22,450 --> 01:10:25,753
That's why the Defense Department
was so interested.

1177
01:10:25,821 --> 01:10:28,022
Dr. Westmont's final tests 
were trying to tell the creature

1178
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:30,557
the difference between the two.

1179
01:10:30,625 --> 01:10:32,893
Obviously, he failed.

1180
01:10:32,894 --> 01:10:35,729
Look, the thing actually spoke to me.

1181
01:10:35,797 --> 01:10:39,232

unlike you.

01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:42,302
