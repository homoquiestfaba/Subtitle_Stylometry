Reagan fully endorsed

A plan to put 100

husband's a Quantico cop

with Marine Security Battalion.

11
00:01:18,034 --> 00:01:20,210
- [Man] Move back!

12
00:01:20,254 --> 00:01:21,429
- Jill, I'm Special Agent Leino

13
00:01:21,472 --> 00:01:22,647
with the Naval
Investigative Service.

14
00:01:22,691 --> 00:01:24,562
I need you to tell me
what happened tonight.

15
00:01:24,606 --> 00:01:26,390
- My husband was on night duty.

16
00:01:26,434 --> 00:01:29,132
I was alone and someone called
and said they were an MP

17
00:01:29,176 --> 00:01:32,135
and Spencer was
hurt in an accident.

18
00:01:32,179 --> 00:01:33,571
They said they were
sending someone

19
00:01:33,615 --> 00:01:35,443
to take me to the hospital.

20
00:01:35,486 --> 00:01:38,141
We drove to the
woods, pulled over.

00:01:38,185 --> 00:01:39,577
I tried to get out.

00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:40,665
He had a knife.

He raped me.

24
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:45,148
- What did he look like?

25
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:46,062
Help us, ma'am.

26
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,151
Tell us what he looked like.

27
00:01:48,195 --> 00:01:49,500
- Black man.

28
00:01:49,544 --> 00:01:51,546

30
00:01:55,506 --> 00:01:58,814

[upbeat brass music]

33
00:02:20,705 --> 00:02:21,924

I need to speak to you ASAP.

35
00:02:28,757 --> 00:02:30,062
- Yes, Sergeant?

36
00:02:30,106 --> 00:02:31,499
Something wrong?

37
00:02:32,543 --> 00:02:34,893
- A woman was raped last night.

38
00:02:34,937 --> 00:02:36,808

00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,030
- Spencer Ames' wife.

41
00:02:42,423 --> 00:02:44,642
Well, you know
Spencer, don't you?

42
00:02:44,686 --> 00:02:46,470
- I trained with him.

43
00:02:46,514 --> 00:02:47,515
We used to carpool.

44
00:02:47,558 --> 00:02:49,473
He lived in my complex.

45
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:52,172
- Well, we're searching
what appears to be

46
00:02:52,215 --> 00:02:53,782
the crime scene now.

47
00:02:55,262 --> 00:02:57,133
- What did this guy look like?

48
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,527
- It was a black guy, glasses.

49
00:03:02,965 --> 00:03:04,532
Jill says he called
and identified himself

50
00:03:04,575 --> 00:03:08,449
as a military policeman
who works with Spencer.

51
00:03:09,798 --> 00:03:12,496
- I'm the only black man in MP.

52
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:18,720
- Naval investigators would
like to speak to you, Scotty.

53
00:03:18,763 --> 00:03:19,547
Get in.

00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:27,729
[engine starts]

56
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,440
- I'm here with Lori Jackson,

57
00:03:43,484 --> 00:03:45,921
head of the Women for
Equal Social Justice,

58
00:03:45,964 --> 00:03:47,357
who has just won
her civil lawsuit

59
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:49,446
against the owner
of a local diner

60
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,318
who is refusing to serve blacks.

61
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:54,538
Ms. Jackson marched with Dr.
King and continues the crusade.

62
00:03:54,582 --> 00:03:57,193
Ms. Jackson, any further
comments you'd like to make?

63
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,368
- Yes, I would.

64
00:03:58,412 --> 00:04:01,415
This is not just
about a local diner.

65
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,286
I want the people out
there to understand

66
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,722
that this is the 80's.

67
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:06,289
And if they think we're
not paying attention

68
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,030
to what's going
on, they're wrong.

69
00:04:08,073 --> 00:04:09,597
They think they can
hide and continue

70
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,338
the same old prejudiced ways,

71
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:13,427
but I want them to know
we're gonna find them,

72
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,819
we're gonna smoke them out,

73
00:04:14,863 --> 00:04:16,647
we're gonna sue them in
every court in this land,

74
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:18,519
and we're gonna win.

75
00:04:18,562 --> 00:04:19,563
- [Reporter] That
was Lori Jackson

76
00:04:19,607 --> 00:04:21,348
of Women for Equal
Social Justice.

77
00:04:21,391 --> 00:04:23,175
Now, back to Jim in the studio.

78
00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:26,440
- Maybe she can help us
with our organization.

79
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:29,530
[phone ringing]

80
00:04:29,573 --> 00:04:30,618
Hello?

81
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:33,882
Yes, he is.

82
00:04:33,925 --> 00:04:35,449
Just a moment.

83
00:04:35,492 --> 00:04:38,278
It's the military police again.

84
00:04:39,975 --> 00:04:40,758
- Hello?

85
00:04:41,585 --> 00:04:43,370
Yes, this is Lindsey Scott.

86
00:04:43,413 --> 00:04:44,240
I'm here.

87
00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:50,551
- I hate those damn calls.

88
00:04:50,594 --> 00:04:53,467
You've never violated
your house arrest.

89
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:56,557
Why they gotta be calling
you every five times a day?

90
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,820
- It's just procedure, Lola.

91
00:04:58,863 --> 00:05:01,475
It's the way the system works.

92
00:05:05,217 --> 00:05:05,957
- All right, Dena baby.

93
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:06,871
What do you think?

94
00:05:06,915 --> 00:05:08,569
- You look beautiful, Mama.

95
00:05:08,612 --> 00:05:09,396
- Teresa?

96
00:05:10,614 --> 00:05:12,268
- I think you should've
gotten a new dress.

97
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,836
That old thing smells
like moth balls.

98
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,446
- Thanks a lot, honey.

99
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,319
- Just giving my opinion.

100
00:05:19,362 --> 00:05:20,407
- Aunt Lily.

101
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:21,408
- Oh, look at you.

102
00:05:21,451 --> 00:05:22,974
You're beautiful.

103
00:05:24,498 --> 00:05:25,673
- And you're looking good.

104
00:05:25,716 --> 00:05:26,717
Always will.

105
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:32,375
- I got something for you.

106
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:33,289
- No.

107
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,682
- Mm-hmm.

108
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:35,813
Look at this.

109
00:05:40,122 --> 00:05:43,517
- That's Cousin Terry's
good luck charm.

110
00:05:45,562 --> 00:05:47,651
I didn't know we still had it.

111
00:05:47,695 --> 00:05:50,480
- I'd never lose this.

112
00:05:50,524 --> 00:05:51,525
He loved it.

113
00:05:53,483 --> 00:05:55,398
You were his little minnow.

114
00:05:55,442 --> 00:05:59,228
And I know he'd want
you to wear it, dear.

115
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:01,404
You're getting too old to
be getting married anymore,

116
00:06:01,448 --> 00:06:02,753
so I just figured it might help.

117
00:06:02,797 --> 00:06:04,581
[both laugh]

118
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,409
Of course, now you know I've
been looking for a new man

119
00:06:06,453 --> 00:06:09,369
for 40 years and it
ain't done me no good.

120
00:06:09,412 --> 00:06:11,936
[both laugh]

121
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,551
- Thank you.

122
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:20,380
- Yes, baby.

123
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:27,387
Now, where's my Dena and Teresa?

124
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:30,781
Come on over here and
give your old aunt a kiss.

125
00:06:30,825 --> 00:06:33,567

[soft guitar music]

130
00:07:38,806 --> 00:07:40,503
- What are you doing?

131
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:47,510
- Just following
tradition, darling.

132
00:07:50,034 --> 00:07:51,514
Over the threshold.

133
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:56,563
Whoa.

134
00:07:56,606 --> 00:07:57,520
It's gonna be a
little crowded in here

135
00:07:57,564 --> 00:07:59,000
when I get all my stuff in.

136
00:07:59,043 --> 00:08:01,132
- [Lori] Oh, we'll manage.

137
00:08:01,176 --> 00:08:02,482
- I promise you one thing.

138
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:03,831
- What's that?

139
00:08:03,874 --> 00:08:05,136
- We're gonna have that
little cabin in the woods

140
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,050
you've always been
dreaming about.

141
00:08:06,094 --> 00:08:07,312
- You mean like a little house?

142
00:08:07,356 --> 00:08:08,531
- Yes, ma'am.

143
00:08:08,575 --> 00:08:09,750
- Something we
can all move into?

144
00:08:09,793 --> 00:08:12,927
- Yes, and we will make
love all night long.

145
00:08:19,586 --> 00:08:20,587
- Teresa?

146
00:08:21,805 --> 00:08:22,589
Teresa?

147
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:25,766
You know what time to
pick up Dena from school

148
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:29,247
and don't forget the PTA
meeting on Thursday night.

149
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,075
Now, if the people
from the NAACP call,

150
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:32,990
give them the
number at the hotel.

151
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:37,255
And Aunt Lily's in charge
of all emergencies.

152
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:39,649
I don't know how I'm
gonna get everything done.

153
00:08:39,693 --> 00:08:42,434
- I've got two jobs
to worry about.

154
00:08:42,478 --> 00:08:46,482
If I can take time off
for a week, so can you.

155
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,570
- I'm trying, I'm trying.

156
00:08:47,614 --> 00:08:49,050
Believe me.

157
00:08:49,093 --> 00:08:52,096
You know how much I'm
looking forward to this trip?

158
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,534
- Mama, you're not
leaving for two more days

159
00:08:54,577 --> 00:08:55,883
and you're already packed?

160
00:08:55,926 --> 00:08:58,059
- Ain't nothing wrong
with being organized.

161
00:08:58,102 --> 00:08:59,756
Now, you're gonna
water all the plants

162
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,931
and don't you and
your sister eat

163
00:09:00,975 --> 00:09:03,107
that sugar cereal all day long.

164
00:09:03,151 --> 00:09:04,805
- Don't worry about us.

[door opens]

166
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:08,156
- Here's the mail, Mama.

167
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:10,245
Looks like somebody
had a lot to say.

168
00:09:10,288 --> 00:09:11,594
- Thanks, baby.

[subdued music]

170
00:09:37,489 --> 00:09:41,668
Now, tell me what you were
doing the day of the assault.

171
00:09:42,973 --> 00:09:45,410
- Well, I finished
cleaning the apartment

172
00:09:45,454 --> 00:09:47,456
and then I went to
Dumphrey's Drug Store

173
00:09:47,499 --> 00:09:50,677
and bought my wife a foot
massager for her birthday.

174
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,592
I wanted to get
her something else,

175
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:54,768
so I drove to Zayre's
on Woodbridge,

176
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:57,814
it's about 20 miles
away, to look.

177
00:09:57,858 --> 00:10:00,077
I didn't find anything.

178
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:01,731
- Now, you said
something in your letter

179
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:03,603
about buying a Coke.

180
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:05,387
- Yeah, from some
white counter girl.

181
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,215
Her friend called her Pam.

182
00:10:07,258 --> 00:10:08,651
Now, I told my lawyer,

183
00:10:08,695 --> 00:10:11,393
but he said since the NIS
had already talked to her.

184
00:10:11,436 --> 00:10:12,524
- [Lori] NIS?

185
00:10:12,568 --> 00:10:14,004
- The Naval
Investigative Services.

186
00:10:14,048 --> 00:10:15,266
- [Lori] I see.

187
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,485
- Since they had
already talked to her,

188
00:10:16,528 --> 00:10:17,747
and she didn't
recognize my picture,

189
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,096
there was nothing he could do.

190
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:22,273
- But, you can't prove
you were at Zayre's?

191
00:10:22,317 --> 00:10:23,318
- No, ma'am.

192
00:10:23,361 --> 00:10:24,667
- What does your lawyer think?

193
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:26,060
- Mr. Kuhnke?

194
00:10:26,103 --> 00:10:27,496
[scoffs]

195
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:29,541
He says we have
nothing to worry about

196
00:10:29,585 --> 00:10:31,500
because they have no evidence.

197
00:10:31,543 --> 00:10:33,458
But, he's not the one on trial.

198
00:10:33,502 --> 00:10:34,677
- Mm-mm.

199
00:10:34,721 --> 00:10:36,244
- You also said that
you wanted me to contact

200
00:10:36,287 --> 00:10:37,637
a Lieutenant Colonel...

201
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,639
- Colonel Harry.

202
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:41,510
Here's his address,
his phone number.

203
00:10:41,553 --> 00:10:43,077
You can talk to him.

204
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,688
And this here is from
the Article 32 hearing.

205
00:10:45,732 --> 00:10:49,083
It's like the military
grand jury hearing.

206
00:10:49,126 --> 00:10:51,955
- Corporal Scott,
I'm an activist.

207
00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:54,697
I'm not an investigator
or an attorney.

208
00:10:54,741 --> 00:10:57,918
I've picketed, I've
marched, I've filed suits,

209
00:10:57,961 --> 00:11:00,660
but this is a
whole new ballgame.

210
00:11:15,413 --> 00:11:17,589
I'll take a look at it.

211
00:11:17,633 --> 00:11:19,591
- My court martial's
in two weeks.

212
00:11:19,635 --> 00:11:22,203
- I'll read it, but no promises.

213
00:11:29,036 --> 00:11:31,691
- [Lindsey] You're the
only one I heard from.

214
00:11:31,734 --> 00:11:32,692
- Excuse me?

215
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:36,957
- I wrote 25 letters
and you're the only one

216
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,437
who took the time to see us.

217
00:11:40,612 --> 00:11:42,614
Mrs. Jackson, thank you.

218
00:11:49,099 --> 00:11:51,580
[bell dinging]

219
00:11:59,588 --> 00:12:00,458
- [Man] How are you doing today?

220
00:12:00,502 --> 00:12:02,025
- Fine.

221
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:04,506
I'm looking for Lieutenant
Colonel Richard Harry.

222
00:12:04,549 --> 00:12:05,768
I believe he owns this place.

223
00:12:05,812 --> 00:12:06,595
- And you are?

224
00:12:06,638 --> 00:12:08,553
- Lori Jackson.

225
00:12:08,597 --> 00:12:13,036
Lindsey Scott suggested
I speak to Colonel Harry.

226
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,995
- All right, I'm Harry.

227
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:20,217
I was a military
trial magistrate.

228
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:21,566
It was my job to
determine if there was

229
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:25,135
sufficient evidence
to charge him.

230
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:25,962
- And?

231
00:12:27,094 --> 00:12:29,487
- They had nothing.

232
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:32,360
They even had the
FBI do two lab tests.

233
00:12:32,403 --> 00:12:33,143
Nothing.

234
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:34,536
No forensic evidence,

235
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:36,799
nothing to link him to the
crime in any way at all.

236
00:12:36,843 --> 00:12:38,496
He didn't have a
rock-solid alibi,

237
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:43,153
but without any evidence I
didn't think it mattered.

238
00:12:43,197 --> 00:12:44,981
- Why did it go ahead?

239
00:12:46,243 --> 00:12:48,942
- I ordered him released.

240
00:12:48,985 --> 00:12:51,683
The next day I
was retired early.

241
00:12:54,034 --> 00:12:55,078
Command influence.

242
00:12:55,122 --> 00:12:56,645
- What does that mean?

243
00:12:56,688 --> 00:13:00,562
- What that means is that his
superiors determine his fate.

244
00:13:01,911 --> 00:13:04,131
If they think you're guilty,

245
00:13:04,174 --> 00:13:06,960
then by Heaven you
are going down.

246
00:13:08,483 --> 00:13:09,789
And by his actions, a
base commander sent a very

247
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:12,835
clear message to any future
members of the court.

248
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:14,445
You find him guilty.

249
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,336
- [gasps] How could I forget?

250
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:36,685
Our first rally together.

251
00:13:36,728 --> 00:13:37,860
- Mm-hmm.

252
00:13:37,904 --> 00:13:40,645
- And not just our first rally.

253
00:13:48,436 --> 00:13:49,480
- What is all this?

254
00:13:49,524 --> 00:13:50,525
- [Lori] Hmm?

255
00:13:50,568 --> 00:13:51,352
- What's this?

256
00:13:51,395 --> 00:13:52,353
This here?

257
00:13:52,396 --> 00:13:53,876
- Oh.

258
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,619
Oh, I met with that
young guy Lindsey Scott.

259
00:13:57,662 --> 00:14:01,014
I spent the last hour
reading his court transcript.

260
00:14:01,057 --> 00:14:01,841
- Oh, no.

261
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:04,582
I know that look.

262
00:14:06,758 --> 00:14:10,110
Listen, that look
stays in Virginia

263
00:14:10,153 --> 00:14:12,939
'cause they don't allow
that look in Hawaii.

264
00:14:12,982 --> 00:14:15,855
- They are looking
to railroad this guy.

265
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:17,421
They want to send him
right into Leavenworth

266
00:14:17,465 --> 00:14:20,294
for the rest of his life
for something he didn't do.

267
00:14:20,337 --> 00:14:22,035
- Well, maybe he did.

268
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:25,647
- I don't think so.

269
00:14:27,127 --> 00:14:28,345
Paul, Paul.

270
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:29,390
- I know.

271
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:30,173
- No.

272
00:14:30,217 --> 00:14:31,044
- No, just let...

273
00:14:31,087 --> 00:14:31,958
- This is a lynch mob.

274
00:14:32,001 --> 00:14:33,829
- This is not some local yokel

275
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,441
who's refusing to
get with integration.

276
00:14:37,485 --> 00:14:39,487
This is the United
States Marine Corps

277
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:42,142
you're gonna be taking on.

278
00:14:42,185 --> 00:14:45,928
You know, the whole United
States Marine Corps.

279
00:14:45,972 --> 00:14:46,755
- Mm-hmm.

280
00:14:47,974 --> 00:14:50,890
- You take on one,
you take on all.

281
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:53,544
Semper Fi.

282
00:14:57,505 --> 00:14:59,594
- I gotta do it.

283
00:14:59,637 --> 00:15:01,901
[soft music]

284
00:15:06,644 --> 00:15:10,866
- I guess Hawaii will still
be there in two weeks.

285
00:15:11,736 --> 00:15:12,520
- Oh.

286
00:15:15,131 --> 00:15:15,915
Thank you.

287
00:15:29,537 --> 00:15:30,712
Mr. Kuhnke?

288
00:15:30,755 --> 00:15:33,323
- Mrs. Jackson, it's a
pleasure to meet you.

289
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:34,150
Please.

290
00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:38,198
Now, what is it
I can do for you?

291
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:41,592
- Well, actually, Mr.
Kuhnke, you can help me.

292
00:15:41,636 --> 00:15:44,987
Now, I've been goin through
this Article 32 transcript

293
00:15:45,031 --> 00:15:47,381
and I'm finding some
things a bit confusing.

294
00:15:47,424 --> 00:15:49,818
- Well, that's what
I'm here for, honey.

295
00:15:49,861 --> 00:15:53,604
Now, why don't you tell me
what it is that's agitating ya.

296
00:15:53,648 --> 00:15:56,172
- Well, if this woman knew

297
00:15:56,216 --> 00:15:57,782
that Lindsey Scott
lived in her building,

298
00:15:57,826 --> 00:16:00,350
why didn't she
identify him by name?

299
00:16:00,394 --> 00:16:01,830
And the gold tooth.

300
00:16:01,873 --> 00:16:03,440
She said she never noticed it.

301
00:16:03,484 --> 00:16:06,487
Well, I noticed it the first
five seconds after I met him.

302
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:09,403
And she picked two
men out of the lineup?

303
00:16:09,446 --> 00:16:11,971
- Mrs. Jackson, this is
what I've been trying

304
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:13,885
to make Lindsey understand.

305
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:16,366
This is an open-and-shut case.

306
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:19,500
I mean, there's no evidence
linking Lindsey to the crime.

307
00:16:19,543 --> 00:16:22,329
I mean, they can't even
establish a crime scene.

308
00:16:22,372 --> 00:16:24,853
And this Jill Ames
woman, as you noted,

309
00:16:24,896 --> 00:16:27,377
she picked two men
out of the lineup.

310
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:29,118
- Well, I understand
that, Mr. Kuhnke.

311
00:16:29,162 --> 00:16:30,554
But, it seems that...

312
00:16:30,598 --> 00:16:33,122
- Mrs. Jackson, I don't
think there's anything more

313
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:36,952
you can do that we're
not already doing
for Corporal Scott.

314
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,214
And, quite simply,

315
00:16:38,258 --> 00:16:40,390
there is no money to
pay you for your time.

316
00:16:40,434 --> 00:16:43,306
- Mr. Kuhnke, I'm
not talking money.

317
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,916
I'm volunteering my time.

318
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,571
- Well, that's very
generous of you.

319
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:51,140
What exactly is
it you want to do?

320
00:16:51,184 --> 00:16:53,360
- Well, continue what I started.

321
00:16:53,403 --> 00:16:56,406
Talking to people,
retracing his steps.

322
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,105
I want to talk to that
soda girl at Zayre's.

323
00:16:59,148 --> 00:17:00,845
- You're wasting
your time, honey.

324
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:02,934
The NIS has already
interviewed her.

325
00:17:02,978 --> 00:17:05,937
- Well, it is my time
to waste, Mr. Kuhnke.

326
00:17:05,981 --> 00:17:07,548
One more thing.

327
00:17:07,591 --> 00:17:10,551
I talked to the manager at
Hardee's where Jill Ames works.

328
00:17:10,594 --> 00:17:11,334
- You did?

329
00:17:11,378 --> 00:17:12,683
- I did.

330
00:17:12,727 --> 00:17:15,164
Did you know that she
worked with other black men

331
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,079
who also fit that description?

332
00:17:17,123 --> 00:17:19,864
And the NIS did
not question them.

333
00:17:19,908 --> 00:17:22,693
- Well, they're pretty
thorough, honey.

334
00:17:22,737 --> 00:17:25,522
I'm sure they'll
get around to it.

335
00:17:28,395 --> 00:17:30,223
- You know, Mr. Kuhnke.

336
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:33,095
There is another point
of confusion for me.

337
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:34,531
- And what's that?

338
00:17:37,665 --> 00:17:41,016
- Aren't they on the
other side, honey?

339
00:17:49,372 --> 00:17:50,112
- Hi, Mama.

340
00:17:50,156 --> 00:17:51,070
- Hi, baby.

341
00:17:54,203 --> 00:17:55,030
- Hi, Dad.

342
00:17:56,553 --> 00:17:58,207
[typewriter clacking]

343
00:17:58,251 --> 00:17:59,078
Yuck.

344
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,168
- Your fingers are dirty.

345
00:18:02,211 --> 00:18:03,256
- Sorry.

346
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:04,518
He looks guilty.

347
00:18:04,561 --> 00:18:06,346
- That is going to
give you pimples.

348
00:18:06,389 --> 00:18:07,521
- Thanks, Mom.

349
00:18:07,564 --> 00:18:09,958
I sure need the extra pressure.

350
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:15,181
- What do you mean
he looks guilty?

351
00:18:15,224 --> 00:18:16,443
- I don't know.

352
00:18:16,486 --> 00:18:17,705
He just looks like
he'd do something bad.

353
00:18:17,748 --> 00:18:19,010
- Based on what?

354
00:18:19,054 --> 00:18:20,621
His look, his tooth?

355
00:18:22,188 --> 00:18:23,580
What?

356
00:18:23,624 --> 00:18:25,365
- He just looks
ghetto, you know?

357
00:18:25,408 --> 00:18:26,322
Sinister.

358
00:18:26,366 --> 00:18:27,845
Dark and evil.

359
00:18:27,889 --> 00:18:29,673
- I don't believe you sometimes.

360
00:18:29,717 --> 00:18:31,327
- [Teresa] Why not?

361
00:18:31,371 --> 00:18:34,548
- Color does not
define who a person is.

362
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:36,811
Well, look at you.

363
00:18:36,854 --> 00:18:39,335
You're light-skinned and nasty.

364
00:18:39,379 --> 00:18:42,817
And worse than that,
you're judgemental.

365
00:18:50,651 --> 00:18:52,609
Ghetto, sinister.

00:18:52,653 --> 00:18:55,873
[typewriter clacking]

367
00:18:58,528 --> 00:18:59,747
Mr. Kuhnke.

368
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,009
- I was just leaving.

369
00:19:01,052 --> 00:19:02,402
I have an appointment
at the courthouse.

370
00:19:02,445 --> 00:19:03,620
I really don't have time.

371
00:19:03,664 --> 00:19:05,405
- But, I've got some
color photos of Lindsey.

372
00:19:05,448 --> 00:19:07,233
I showed 'em to the
soda girl at Zayre's,

373
00:19:07,276 --> 00:19:08,538
she recognized him.

374
00:19:08,582 --> 00:19:10,105
She said she remembers
selling him a Coke.

375
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,847
- Did she remember
the exact day?

376
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,631
- Well, she said
the end of April.

377
00:19:14,675 --> 00:19:16,242
- It's got to be April 20th.

378
00:19:16,285 --> 00:19:18,679
If it's a day sooner or a
day later, it's no good.

379
00:19:18,722 --> 00:19:21,551
- But, don't you think you
should just talk to her?

380
00:19:21,595 --> 00:19:23,597
- Honey, you worry too much.

381
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,164
I already told ya.

382
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:26,077
There's no evidence.

383
00:19:26,121 --> 00:19:28,123
This case is in the bag.

For the next 15 minutes

That's right.

00:19:45,749 --> 00:19:48,230
Three times the value
on any store coupons

00:19:48,274 --> 00:19:50,189

00:19:55,324 --> 00:19:57,413
- [Woman] Can I help you?

392
00:19:58,327 --> 00:20:00,068
- Ms. Hills?

393
00:20:00,111 --> 00:20:00,895
- Yes?

394
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:03,419
- Hi.

395
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,162
My name is Lori
Jackson and I'm here

396
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,817
on behalf of a young
man who's been accused

397
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,559
of rape and attempted murder.

398
00:20:12,602 --> 00:20:14,387
- Uh-huh.

399
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,389
- Now, he claims that
he was in this store

400
00:20:16,432 --> 00:20:18,565
at the time the crime took place

401
00:20:18,608 --> 00:20:21,785
and I was hoping you
could verify that.

402
00:20:21,829 --> 00:20:22,612
- I see.

403
00:20:24,397 --> 00:20:25,789
- I spoke to your
supervisor and he said

404
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,965
that you were working
the night of April 20th.

405
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:32,013
- Well, if my supervisor
said so, I guess I was.

406
00:20:34,407 --> 00:20:37,932
- [Lori] Do you remember
seeing that man?

407
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,675
- Yeah, I've seen this guy.

408
00:20:41,718 --> 00:20:43,198
- You remember him?

409
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,636
- Yeah, I remember him
because we don't get that many

410
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:50,249
black clientele in this store
and the ones that we do get

411
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:52,468
are our regular customers.

412
00:20:53,948 --> 00:20:57,560
I thought he might
be a shoplifter, so
I kept my eye on him.

413
00:20:57,604 --> 00:21:00,259
But, when I saw that he
wasn't going to do anything,

414
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:02,173
I stopped watching.

415
00:21:02,217 --> 00:21:05,525
- Do you remember seeing
him the night of April 20th?

416
00:21:05,568 --> 00:21:06,395
- April 20th?

417
00:21:08,354 --> 00:21:09,877
Well, that was a long time ago.

418
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,921
At least six months.

419
00:21:10,965 --> 00:21:13,402
I can't remember the exact day.

420
00:21:15,448 --> 00:21:17,101
Was it that night?

421
00:21:20,061 --> 00:21:21,323
I couldn't testify to it.

422
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:23,194
You should've come
and seen me that week.

423
00:21:23,238 --> 00:21:24,457
- Sister, you're right.

424
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,327
Somebody should've
contacted you.

425
00:21:25,371 --> 00:21:26,154
That's true.

426
00:21:26,197 --> 00:21:27,329
- Of course.

427
00:21:27,373 --> 00:21:28,374
- Records.

428
00:21:28,417 --> 00:21:29,853
What about records?

429
00:21:29,897 --> 00:21:33,509
You must keep like store logs
or video tapes from the...

430
00:21:33,553 --> 00:21:34,510
- Oh, no.

431
00:21:34,554 --> 00:21:36,120
We don't keep
surveillance video.

432
00:21:36,164 --> 00:21:39,123
We take photos of the people
we bust, but like I said,

433
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:42,953
I did not bust him, I
just kept my eye on him.

434
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,742
- Would you mind if I had Mr.
Scott's attorney contact you?

435
00:21:50,004 --> 00:21:51,527
- Well, ma'am.

436
00:21:51,571 --> 00:21:55,183
He can call me, but I
cannot testify to anything

437
00:21:55,226 --> 00:21:56,619
unless I'm sure.

438
00:21:57,838 --> 00:22:00,275
I can't purger myself.

439
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,191
- I would never
ask you to do that.

440
00:22:04,888 --> 00:22:05,672
- Okay.

441
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:07,500
- Thank you.

442
00:22:07,543 --> 00:22:08,501
- You're welcome.

443
00:22:08,544 --> 00:22:09,980
- Thank you very much.

444
00:22:10,024 --> 00:22:11,112
We'll be in contact with you.

445
00:22:11,155 --> 00:22:12,374
- [Hills] Okay.

446
00:22:12,418 --> 00:22:13,157
- They'll probably
call you today.

447
00:22:13,201 --> 00:22:13,723
- [Hills] All right.

448
00:22:13,767 --> 00:22:14,463
- Bye-bye.

449
00:22:14,507 --> 00:22:16,117
- [Hills] Bye-bye.

00:22:34,614 --> 00:22:36,442
- Come on, let's go.

00:22:36,485 --> 00:22:38,313
One more time.

453
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,836
Up.

454
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,620
All right.

455
00:22:40,663 --> 00:22:43,449
Here, hold my two tones.

456
00:22:43,492 --> 00:22:44,580
Okay, let's go.

457
00:22:46,147 --> 00:22:47,148
There we go.

458
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:50,412
- [Lori] Terry?

459
00:22:50,456 --> 00:22:51,805
- [Terry] Hmm?

460
00:22:51,848 --> 00:22:54,155
- [Lori] Why do we gotta
walk all the way around here

461
00:22:54,198 --> 00:22:57,201
when the church is
just up Wilmer Road?

462
00:22:57,245 --> 00:22:58,899
- [Terry] We can't
go down Wilmer Road.

463
00:22:58,942 --> 00:23:00,291
- [Lori] Why not?

464
00:23:00,335 --> 00:23:01,554
- [Terry] Because we're colored.

465
00:23:01,597 --> 00:23:04,165
Colored folks aren't
allowed down Wilmer Road.

466
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:05,471
- [Lori] Who says?

467
00:23:05,514 --> 00:23:06,602
- [Terry] White folks.

468
00:23:06,646 --> 00:23:09,170
- [Lori] Even if we
was going to church?

469
00:23:09,213 --> 00:23:11,128
That's a good reason.

470
00:23:11,172 --> 00:23:12,303
- [Terry] That is a good reason,

471
00:23:12,347 --> 00:23:15,306
but they don't think like that.

472
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,569
Now, we're almost there.

473
00:23:16,612 --> 00:23:19,049
Don't drop my two tones now.

474
00:23:21,225 --> 00:23:22,401
All right now.

475
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:23,880
We're almost there.

476
00:23:32,236 --> 00:23:35,457
- Mr. Kuhnke, we're 24 hours
away from Lindsey's trial.

477
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:37,677
What's the plan?

478
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,549
- As I've said before,
there is no evidence.

479
00:23:40,593 --> 00:23:42,159
It's a clear case
of command influence

480
00:23:42,203 --> 00:23:44,031
and I'm requesting
a change of venue.

481
00:23:44,074 --> 00:23:46,773
- And what does that do?

482
00:23:46,816 --> 00:23:49,558
- It'll give us an
unbiased jury pool.

483
00:23:49,602 --> 00:23:53,170
Since there's no evidence,
they can't convict.

484
00:23:53,214 --> 00:23:55,390
- With all due
respect, Mr. Kuhnke.

485
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,523
There are a lot of
innocent people in prison

486
00:23:57,566 --> 00:24:00,743
whose lawyers said
the same thing.

00:24:00,787 --> 00:24:03,920
[slow trumpet music]

488
00:24:18,413 --> 00:24:19,762
Thank you for coming out.

489
00:24:19,806 --> 00:24:21,547
- One cause, one purpose.

490
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,113
No thanks needed.

491
00:24:29,163 --> 00:24:30,469
- [Man] All rise.

[gavel bangs]

493
00:24:43,569 --> 00:24:47,398
- The defense will make
its pretrial motions.

494
00:24:47,442 --> 00:24:51,315
- I'd like to submit a
motion for a change of venue.

495
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:52,403
On two grounds.

496
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,582
On the grounds that Corporal
Scott, in our opinion,

497
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:59,976
cannot receive a fair
and impartial trial

498
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,457
because of command influence.

499
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,328
Undue command influence.

500
00:25:04,372 --> 00:25:06,548
And because of
pretrial publicity.

501
00:25:06,592 --> 00:25:07,767
- Request denied.

502
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:10,900
[people mumbling]

503
00:25:10,944 --> 00:25:12,554
- You're Honor.

504
00:25:12,598 --> 00:25:15,165
- The defense request for a
change of venue is denied.

505
00:25:15,209 --> 00:25:19,169
Counselor, I'll receive the
plea of the accused now.

506
00:25:19,213 --> 00:25:21,389
- [Kuhnke] Your Honor, Corporal
Scott pleads not guilty

507
00:25:21,432 --> 00:25:24,958
to all charges and
specifications.

508
00:25:25,001 --> 00:25:27,526
- My god, we're going to trial.

509
00:25:34,445 --> 00:25:36,752
- We will call a witness

510
00:25:36,796 --> 00:25:40,582
who saw Corporal
Scott that afternoon.

511
00:25:40,626 --> 00:25:42,932
Who will describe his clothing.

512
00:25:42,976 --> 00:25:46,370
Put him in a certain
area at a certain time.

513
00:25:46,414 --> 00:25:50,157
We will call two witnesses
who will place the corporal

514
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,899
at a time which
makes it impossible

515
00:25:52,942 --> 00:25:55,292
for him to have
committed these offenses.

516
00:25:55,336 --> 00:25:58,731
- He hasn't even
talked to any of them.

517
00:25:58,774 --> 00:26:02,125
- Agent Lindner,
you still don't know

518
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:04,824
where the crime
scene is, do you?

519
00:26:06,173 --> 00:26:07,566
- No, sir.

520
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:11,613
- And the FBI lab tests
that you conducted for

521
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:14,398
blood, semen, hair,

522
00:26:16,662 --> 00:26:19,490
soil on the soles of
the shoes of the victim

523
00:26:19,534 --> 00:26:20,927
and the suspect.

524
00:26:22,102 --> 00:26:24,452
What were the results?

525
00:26:24,495 --> 00:26:28,499
- They were all negative
or inconclusive.

526
00:26:28,543 --> 00:26:32,460
- So, there's absolutely
no physical evidence

527
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,420
linking Corporal
Scott with the victim?

528
00:26:37,813 --> 00:26:41,643
- It was all negative
or inconclusive.

529
00:26:41,687 --> 00:26:43,863
- Thank you, Agent Lindner.

530
00:26:43,906 --> 00:26:46,561
[tense music]

531
00:26:48,737 --> 00:26:50,609
- After he raped me,

532
00:26:52,785 --> 00:26:54,656
he started to choke me.

533
00:26:57,354 --> 00:27:01,576
I tried to push his arms
away and then I blacked out.

534
00:27:03,186 --> 00:27:06,668
When I woke up, he
was standing over me,

535
00:27:06,712 --> 00:27:10,890
and he had the knife in his
hands, and he was laughing.

536
00:27:13,414 --> 00:27:14,676
- Do you see the man
who did this to you

537
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,244
in the courtroom today?

538
00:27:17,287 --> 00:27:18,811
- Yes, sir.

539
00:27:18,854 --> 00:27:22,292
- Would you please point him
out to the members of the jury?

540
00:27:27,515 --> 00:27:29,430
- This man right there.

541
00:27:31,432 --> 00:27:32,476
- This government
has no more questions

542
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,044
for this witness, Your Honor.

543
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:43,357
- Ms. Ames, I don't
mean to upset you,

544
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,403
but if I do, it's just
to get at the truth.

545
00:27:46,447 --> 00:27:50,669
At the physical lineup you
identified two men, didn't you?

546
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:55,978
And you said you were sorry,
but you couldn't be sure.

547
00:27:56,022 --> 00:27:58,546
- I was 99.9% sure.

548
00:27:58,589 --> 00:28:02,550
- But, didn't you say you were
sorry you couldn't be sure?

549
00:28:05,422 --> 00:28:06,597
- Yes.

550
00:28:06,641 --> 00:28:08,382
[people chattering]

551
00:28:08,425 --> 00:28:09,426
- Thank you.

552
00:28:11,385 --> 00:28:13,387
- Is that what Kuhnke
calls a cross-examination?

553
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,997
I mean, for God's sake.

554
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:16,956
He didn't even press her on
the fact that she knew Scott.

555
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:18,305
Her husband was
friends with her.

556
00:28:18,348 --> 00:28:19,654
I mean, why didn't
she just come out

557
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,264
and say it was Lindsey Scott,

558
00:28:21,308 --> 00:28:22,962
the black guy who
lives in my building?

559
00:28:23,005 --> 00:28:25,181
It's not like her husband had
a lot of black co-workers.

560
00:28:25,225 --> 00:28:26,400
He only had one.

561
00:28:27,793 --> 00:28:28,707
Mr. Kuhnke.

562
00:28:31,448 --> 00:28:32,319
Mr. Kuhnke!

563
00:28:38,107 --> 00:28:40,719
[phone ringing]

564
00:28:50,903 --> 00:28:51,730
- Hello?

565
00:28:55,821 --> 00:28:57,170
It's Kuhnke.

566
00:28:57,213 --> 00:28:58,737
Honey, it's Kuhnke.

567
00:29:07,441 --> 00:29:08,224
- Hello?

568
00:29:10,096 --> 00:29:10,879
Mm-hmm.

569
00:29:14,622 --> 00:29:16,667
Why are you calling me now?

570
00:29:17,973 --> 00:29:21,847
I tried to have this
conversation with you hours ago.

571
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,892
[sighs]

572
00:29:23,936 --> 00:29:25,546
You know, if Lindsey
Scott's life wasn't

573
00:29:25,589 --> 00:29:29,768
hanging in the balance I would
just tell you to go to hell.

574
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:30,638
Uh-huh.

575
00:29:30,681 --> 00:29:31,552
All right.

576
00:29:31,595 --> 00:29:32,640
Okay.

577
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:37,688
[groans]

578
00:29:39,429 --> 00:29:41,780
[yawns]

579
00:29:41,823 --> 00:29:44,217
Now, he wants me to round
up all the witnesses

580
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:47,568
that he should've talked
to a long time ago.

581
00:29:47,611 --> 00:29:48,961
God, what an idiot.

582
00:29:49,004 --> 00:29:50,440
Should've known.

583
00:29:54,575 --> 00:29:57,578
[people chattering]

584
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,800
He'll be in a few minutes.

585
00:30:16,423 --> 00:30:20,166
Mr. Kuhnke, I got all
the witnesses you wanted.

586
00:30:20,209 --> 00:30:21,689
Everybody's here but Ruby.

587
00:30:21,732 --> 00:30:22,472
- I see.

588
00:30:22,516 --> 00:30:24,213
Well, where is she?

589
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:26,868
I need her now.

590
00:30:26,912 --> 00:30:28,174
- [Lori] Well, I don't know.

591
00:30:28,217 --> 00:30:29,610
I think she's on her
way here, I hope.

592
00:30:29,653 --> 00:30:31,481
I know she hasn't had time
to look at her records.

593
00:30:31,525 --> 00:30:33,875
- Time is of the essence.

594
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,443
- By the way, you're welcome.

595
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,410
Oh, Ruby.

596
00:30:47,454 --> 00:30:48,150
Please, answer the phone.

597
00:30:48,194 --> 00:30:49,412
Sister, be there.

598
00:30:53,547 --> 00:30:54,591
Ruby!

599
00:30:56,332 --> 00:30:58,465
I'm so glad you got my message.

600
00:30:58,508 --> 00:30:59,901
They want to put you
on the stand next.

601
00:30:59,945 --> 00:31:00,684
- What?

602
00:31:00,728 --> 00:31:01,468
- Yes.

603
00:31:01,511 --> 00:31:02,338
- Girl, no.

604
00:31:02,382 --> 00:31:03,339
You must be out of your mind.

605
00:31:03,383 --> 00:31:04,732
No, my hair's a mess.

606
00:31:04,775 --> 00:31:06,386
I didn't even have any time
to put any stockings on.

607
00:31:06,429 --> 00:31:07,648
And honey, nevermind the makeup.

608
00:31:07,691 --> 00:31:08,431
Oh, no.

609
00:31:08,475 --> 00:31:09,476
I cannot do this.

610
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:10,390
- Don't fret.

611
00:31:10,433 --> 00:31:12,261
You're black, you're beautiful,

612
00:31:12,305 --> 00:31:15,482
and you're here to save the day.

613
00:31:15,525 --> 00:31:18,050
- Ms. Hills, did
you see the accused,

614
00:31:18,093 --> 00:31:22,750
Corporal Lindsey Scott, on
the 20th of April, 1983?

615
00:31:22,793 --> 00:31:24,056
- Well, sir.

616
00:31:24,099 --> 00:31:25,535
That's kind of hard
for me to pinpoint

617
00:31:25,579 --> 00:31:28,887
whether I saw him on April 20th.

618
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:32,542
- You don't know if you
saw him on April 20th?

619
00:31:32,586 --> 00:31:36,807
- I remember the last time
I saw him was in the Spring.

620
00:31:38,853 --> 00:31:41,856
[people chattering]

621
00:31:43,336 --> 00:31:46,469
- [Kuhnke] No more
questions, Your Honor.

622
00:31:46,513 --> 00:31:49,211
- [Judge] The witness
will step down.

623
00:31:49,255 --> 00:31:50,996
If the defense doesn't
have any more witnesses

624
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:55,261
to call at this time, the
court will take a brief recess.

625
00:31:57,306 --> 00:31:59,787
[woman crying]

626
00:32:04,618 --> 00:32:06,968
[tense music]

627
00:32:10,058 --> 00:32:12,191
- We, the members of the jury,

628
00:32:12,234 --> 00:32:15,455
find the accused,
Corporal Lindsey Scott,

629
00:32:15,498 --> 00:32:18,762
guilty on all counts and
sentence him to be confined

630
00:32:18,806 --> 00:32:21,243
to hard labor for 30 years

631
00:32:21,287 --> 00:32:25,073
and his rank to be reduced
to that of private.

632
00:32:27,293 --> 00:32:28,076
- Oh, no.

633
00:32:29,034 --> 00:32:31,471
No, he's not guilty.

634
00:32:31,514 --> 00:32:32,602
He's not guilty!

635
00:32:32,646 --> 00:32:34,561
Please, listen to me.

636
00:32:35,649 --> 00:32:36,693
Please, listen!

637
00:32:36,737 --> 00:32:37,999
Leave him alone!

638
00:32:38,043 --> 00:32:39,392
Leave him alone!

639
00:32:39,435 --> 00:32:40,610
He's not guilty!

640
00:32:41,742 --> 00:32:43,178
No, Lindsey!

641
00:32:43,222 --> 00:32:44,223
Lindsey!

642
00:32:44,266 --> 00:32:45,180
Lindsey!

643
00:32:45,224 --> 00:32:47,443
Don't touch me, don't touch me!

644
00:32:47,487 --> 00:32:48,923
Let him go!

645
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,359
Let him go!

646
00:32:50,403 --> 00:32:52,187
He's not guilty!

647
00:32:52,231 --> 00:32:53,406
He's not guilty.

648
00:32:55,103 --> 00:32:57,714
[subdued music]

649
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:07,942
- [Man] Well, this
isn't the first time

650
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,423
we've ran into this problem
and he's said that to us.

651
00:33:10,466 --> 00:33:11,380
[phone ringing]

652
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,947
- Well, why don't you tell him?

653
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:16,559
- [Man] Well, I spoke to
her husband last night.

654
00:33:16,603 --> 00:33:18,518
- Howard and Howard.

655
00:33:18,561 --> 00:33:19,998
Can I help you?

656
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:20,781
One moment, please.

657
00:33:20,824 --> 00:33:21,782
[phone ringing]

658
00:33:21,825 --> 00:33:23,392
Howard and Howard.

659
00:33:23,436 --> 00:33:24,654
No, I'm sorry.

660
00:33:24,698 --> 00:33:25,960
Mr. Leino is on
another phone call.

661
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,048
Hold, please.

662
00:33:28,093 --> 00:33:29,355
Can I help you?

663
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:32,532
- Yeah, I'm here
to see Mr. Leino.

664
00:33:32,575 --> 00:33:34,273
- [Secretary] Do you
have an appointment?

665
00:33:34,316 --> 00:33:35,056
- Lori Jackson.

666
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,275
He's expecting me.

667
00:33:36,318 --> 00:33:38,451
- One moment, please.

668
00:33:38,494 --> 00:33:41,367
- Do you have a restroom
I could use real quick?

669
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:43,151
- [Secretary] Yeah, it's
down the hall to the left.

670
00:33:43,195 --> 00:33:44,631
- Oh, thank you.

671
00:33:46,415 --> 00:33:49,984
[people chattering]

672
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:50,767
- [Man] No, I'm sorry.

673
00:33:50,811 --> 00:33:51,681
I don't know her.

674
00:33:51,725 --> 00:33:54,032
Take a number and a message.

675
00:33:55,381 --> 00:33:56,469
Lori Jackson.

676
00:33:57,383 --> 00:33:58,427
- That's me.

677
00:34:00,342 --> 00:34:02,562
I'm with Women for
Equal Social Justice.

678
00:34:02,605 --> 00:34:04,303
I think you should take
a look at this brief.

679
00:34:04,346 --> 00:34:05,565
It's concerning the case

680
00:34:05,608 --> 00:34:07,523
United States versus
Corporal Lindsey Scott.

681
00:34:07,567 --> 00:34:09,438
Now, he was wrongfully
convicted of a crime

682
00:34:09,482 --> 00:34:10,961
he did not commit
and I think that...

683
00:34:11,005 --> 00:34:11,745
- Excuse me.

684
00:34:11,788 --> 00:34:12,833
Whoa, whoa.

685
00:34:12,876 --> 00:34:15,270
I am familiar with the case.

686
00:34:16,576 --> 00:34:18,534
Please, have a seat.

687
00:34:18,578 --> 00:34:20,058
Take a deep breath.

688
00:34:21,537 --> 00:34:22,538
- Thank you.

689
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,543
- So, how did you get my name?

690
00:34:27,587 --> 00:34:29,545
- Well, someone told
me about your firm.

691
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:32,331
They said it was the best
criminal law firm in town.

692
00:34:32,374 --> 00:34:35,116
They also said it was
impossible to get an appointment

693
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,423
unless you called a month
in advance, or were rich,

694
00:34:37,466 --> 00:34:39,338
or came with someone's
recommendation.

695
00:34:39,381 --> 00:34:43,516
Well, I'm not rich, I don't
have a month, so I improvised.

696
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:46,432
I, however, am
recommending myself.

697
00:34:47,694 --> 00:34:51,350
- New cases have to go
through the partners.

698
00:34:51,393 --> 00:34:53,265
- You're not a partner?

699
00:34:54,266 --> 00:34:55,093
- No.

700
00:34:56,006 --> 00:34:56,746
- Oh.

701
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,096
- Wait a second.

702
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:00,489
That doesn't mean
I can't help you.

703
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,144
Talk to me.

704
00:35:08,193 --> 00:35:11,370
- Is an ineffectual defense
a reason for a new trial?

705
00:35:11,413 --> 00:35:14,590
- Yes, it's called
a Dubay hearing.

706
00:35:16,418 --> 00:35:19,465
Okay, you convince me this
isn't a total waste of time

707
00:35:19,508 --> 00:35:21,945
so I can convince my bosses.

708
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,123
- All right.

709
00:35:34,871 --> 00:35:36,438
- [Leino] Excuse me, Mr. Howard.

710
00:35:36,482 --> 00:35:37,222
- [Mr. Howard] Yes, John.

711
00:35:37,265 --> 00:35:38,571
What is it?

712
00:35:38,614 --> 00:35:40,703
- I just met with a
woman, Lori Jackson,

713
00:35:40,747 --> 00:35:42,575
about the Lindsey Scott case.

714
00:35:42,618 --> 00:35:44,272
- Marine out of Quantico?

715
00:35:44,316 --> 00:35:45,839
Military appeals.

716
00:35:45,882 --> 00:35:48,407
Messy business, especially
appealing the government.

717
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:49,234
Look out.

718
00:35:51,584 --> 00:35:54,413
- She said the defense
was not quite up to par.

719
00:35:54,456 --> 00:35:57,981
Now, I told her a Dubay hearing
was a long shot at best.

720
00:35:58,025 --> 00:36:00,767
It's difficult to prove any
defense team was ineffectual.

721
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:01,681
- Look out.

722
00:36:04,423 --> 00:36:05,206
- Um.

723
00:36:07,556 --> 00:36:08,470
What do you think?

724
00:36:08,514 --> 00:36:10,603
- What do you think?

725
00:36:10,646 --> 00:36:12,257
- Well, she has a good case.

726
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,128
- Military appeals.

727
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,477
Read it.

728
00:36:15,521 --> 00:36:17,523
You have your first case.

729
00:36:17,566 --> 00:36:20,439
And tell them we'll
do it pro bono.

730
00:36:20,482 --> 00:36:21,570
- By myself?

731
00:36:21,614 --> 00:36:22,528
Alone?

732
00:36:22,571 --> 00:36:23,833
- As counsel.

733
00:36:23,877 --> 00:36:25,879
Take Myers here
if you need help.

734
00:36:25,922 --> 00:36:27,097
- Sir.

735
00:36:27,141 --> 00:36:28,360
- You can be co-counsels.

736
00:36:28,403 --> 00:36:30,057
It's about time you
two started getting

737
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,580
some courtroom exposure.

738
00:36:31,624 --> 00:36:32,494
- Yes, sir.

739
00:36:34,322 --> 00:36:35,149
- [Mr. Howard] Leino.

740
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,455
- Yes, sir?

741
00:36:36,498 --> 00:36:40,502
- Take a few lessons from
Myers on how to dress.

742
00:36:40,546 --> 00:36:41,460
- Yes, sir.

743
00:36:42,939 --> 00:36:45,725
What's wrong with
the way I dress?

744
00:36:47,335 --> 00:36:49,598
- I don't know what
you want from me,

745
00:36:49,642 --> 00:36:51,948
but I love the Marine Corps.

746
00:36:51,992 --> 00:36:53,254
I always have.

747
00:36:54,473 --> 00:36:57,519
I don't blame the corps
for this, I blame the NIS.

748
00:36:57,563 --> 00:36:59,913
I was a good Marine
and they had no right

749
00:36:59,956 --> 00:37:02,437
to treat me the way they did.

750
00:37:04,091 --> 00:37:07,268
I just want to be a
good Marine again.

751
00:37:12,621 --> 00:37:13,622
- Mr. Leino?

752
00:37:16,408 --> 00:37:19,541
- I respect your
conviction, Private.

753
00:37:21,848 --> 00:37:23,937
We'll see what we can do.

754
00:37:26,026 --> 00:37:28,420
[knocking on glass]

755
00:37:28,463 --> 00:37:29,638
- Well, that's time.

756
00:37:29,682 --> 00:37:30,552
- Right.

757
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:38,778
You hang in there.

758
00:37:38,821 --> 00:37:39,953
- Yes, sir.

759
00:37:39,996 --> 00:37:40,997
- All right.

760
00:37:42,434 --> 00:37:44,174
- [Lori] I'll talk to you soon.

761
00:37:44,218 --> 00:37:45,219
- All right.

762
00:37:54,576 --> 00:37:56,361
- Myers was in the Army
and I was a Marine.

763
00:37:56,404 --> 00:37:58,841
Myers was in a high-profile
case where he defended a man

764
00:37:58,885 --> 00:38:02,541
accused of misdeeds in the
My Lai massacre in Vietnam.

765
00:38:02,584 --> 00:38:05,544
Lori Jackson, this
is Gary Myers.

766
00:38:06,458 --> 00:38:07,459
- Nice to meet you.

767
00:38:07,502 --> 00:38:08,373
- Likewise.

768
00:38:09,374 --> 00:38:10,592
I'm glad you made it back.

769
00:38:10,636 --> 00:38:13,508
Listen, there's some
things we need to go over.

770
00:38:13,552 --> 00:38:14,379
- Like what?

771
00:38:14,422 --> 00:38:16,119
- Well, Mrs. Jackson.

772
00:38:16,163 --> 00:38:19,035
John and I need to hash
out some legal issues here,

773
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:21,255
so if you would excuse us.

774
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,170
- So, the ignorant black
woman just steps aside

775
00:38:23,213 --> 00:38:26,608
and let the Harvard
boys do their thing?

776
00:38:28,523 --> 00:38:30,612
- This is as much your
case as it is ours.

777
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:33,093
- This is not just a case to me.

778
00:38:33,136 --> 00:38:34,007
This is a cause.

779
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:34,921
There's a big difference.

780
00:38:34,964 --> 00:38:36,488
Now, let me be perfectly clear.

781
00:38:36,531 --> 00:38:38,446
I look out for Lindsey Scott,

782
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:41,754
so I need to know
what's going on.

783
00:38:41,797 --> 00:38:43,582
So, where do we start?

784
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,543
Thank you.

785
00:38:57,683 --> 00:38:59,598
I have something
important to say

786
00:38:59,641 --> 00:39:02,165
and I hope you'll understand.

787
00:39:06,561 --> 00:39:10,609
Lindsey's lawyers have made
a motion for a retrial.

788
00:39:10,652 --> 00:39:12,654
- What does that have
to do with all of us?

789
00:39:12,698 --> 00:39:15,483
- It means I'm going to be
working with Leino and Myers

790
00:39:15,527 --> 00:39:18,486
and it could drag on
for quite some time.

791
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:19,444
- How long?

792
00:39:20,445 --> 00:39:21,837
- Maybe even a year or more.

793
00:39:21,881 --> 00:39:22,664
- A year?

794
00:39:26,842 --> 00:39:29,845
What I don't understand,
Lori, is you've done it.

795
00:39:29,889 --> 00:39:30,977
You've done it.

796
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,457
You got him
high-powered lawyers,

797
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,024
so Scott has a
fighting chance, okay?

798
00:39:35,068 --> 00:39:36,330
- Paul.

799
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,419
- Wait, how do you
girls feel, huh?

800
00:39:38,463 --> 00:39:40,334
Am I the only one here?

801
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,082
I guess I am.

802
00:40:08,493 --> 00:40:11,583
$200 worth of calls
from Lindsey Scott.

803
00:40:16,588 --> 00:40:18,198
- Well, you know he
has to call collect.

804
00:40:18,241 --> 00:40:20,156
- How are we gonna pay it?

805
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,462
And now you're saying
this case could drag on

806
00:40:21,506 --> 00:40:23,769
for another year?

807
00:40:23,812 --> 00:40:25,901
You've got to give it up.

808
00:40:28,121 --> 00:40:29,470
- You know, Paul.

809
00:40:29,514 --> 00:40:31,777
I don't know if you
can ever understand.

810
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:34,040
- I feel like you care
more about Lindsey Scott

811
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:35,955
than you're own family.

812
00:40:37,565 --> 00:40:40,394
- Are you calling
me a bad mother?

813
00:40:42,527 --> 00:40:45,312
Why do you think I'm doing this?

814
00:40:45,355 --> 00:40:48,054
I don't want my girls
called little niggers,

815
00:40:48,097 --> 00:40:51,318
or trying three times
harder just to fit in.

816
00:40:51,361 --> 00:40:53,451
You don't have to make
people comfortable.

817
00:40:53,494 --> 00:40:55,975
As if you're gonna steal their
purse, or rob their house,

818
00:40:56,018 --> 00:40:58,499
just because your skin is dark.

819
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,112
- Have you forgotten?

820
00:41:03,156 --> 00:41:07,377
My parents still haven't talked
to me since I married you.

821
00:41:22,436 --> 00:41:24,525
- How can they just move a
prisoner to another state

822
00:41:24,569 --> 00:41:26,484
without calling his
lawyers, or his family?

823
00:41:26,527 --> 00:41:28,050
What kind of system is this?

824
00:41:28,094 --> 00:41:30,531
I mean, they're sneaking him
out so that nobody can see him.

825
00:41:30,575 --> 00:41:31,663
- The transfer order's legit.

826
00:41:31,706 --> 00:41:33,012
There's nothing we
can do about it.

827
00:41:33,055 --> 00:41:34,274
- Funny they should do
it right when you file

828
00:41:34,317 --> 00:41:35,405
for a new trial and
a Dubay hearing.

829
00:41:35,449 --> 00:41:36,232
- I know.

830
00:41:38,539 --> 00:41:42,108
You need to make time
work for you in there.

831
00:41:43,805 --> 00:41:44,589
Use it.

832
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:48,375
You need to get yourself
in the right mindset

833
00:41:48,418 --> 00:41:50,029
just to get by.

834
00:41:50,072 --> 00:41:53,206
It's like you're getting
ready for a tour of duty.

835
00:41:53,249 --> 00:41:55,687
The toughest tour in the corps.

836
00:41:57,471 --> 00:42:00,343
And you need to be
tough to get by.

837
00:42:06,959 --> 00:42:07,742
- Lindsey.

838
00:42:12,442 --> 00:42:16,534
I swear on everything I
love, I will get you out.

839
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,496
You just have to trust me.

843
00:42:46,085 --> 00:42:47,565
- [Reporter] Mrs. Jackson,
you obviously believe

844
00:42:47,608 --> 00:42:49,567
Lindsey Scott is
an innocent man.

845
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:50,350
- Yes.

846
00:42:50,393 --> 00:42:51,743
Yes, I do.

847
00:42:51,786 --> 00:42:54,528
This man has been railroaded
and convicted unjustly.

848
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,835
- [Reporter] Don't you think
Scott received a fair trial?

849
00:42:56,878 --> 00:42:58,619
- No, absolutely not.

850
00:42:58,663 --> 00:43:00,186
I was there, and
I'm telling you,

851
00:43:00,229 --> 00:43:01,796
there's no way he
received a fair trial.

852
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,059
How could he when
the Quantico command

853
00:43:04,103 --> 00:43:05,365
is pulling all the strings?

854
00:43:05,408 --> 00:43:09,151

What's wrong?

862
00:43:30,782 --> 00:43:33,349
- Kids at school were
giving her a hard time.

- Well, why?

864
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:37,397
- 'Cause her mom's on
TV defending a rapist.

- He is not a rapist.

866

guilty, wasn't he?

867

893
00:45:09,619 --> 00:45:10,403
- Oh, my god!

894
00:45:10,446 --> 00:45:11,491
I've gotta tell Kelly!

895
00:45:11,534 --> 00:45:13,449
- How did that happen?

896
00:45:13,493 --> 00:45:15,451
- [Lori] Well, I
just wrote a letter.

897
00:45:15,495 --> 00:45:16,975
- That's great, that's great.

898
00:45:17,018 --> 00:45:19,586
When are they coming?

899
00:45:19,629 --> 00:45:20,500
- Tomorrow.

900
00:45:22,545 --> 00:45:25,374
[subdued music]

901
00:45:31,467 --> 00:45:33,731
- I said I was going fishing.

902
00:45:35,776 --> 00:45:37,560
So, I'm going fishing.

903
00:45:49,703 --> 00:45:50,922
- [Man] All right, everybody.

904
00:45:50,965 --> 00:45:54,577
We're ready to start
taping in 10 minutes.

905
00:45:54,621 --> 00:45:55,753
- [Crewman] Set it right here?

906
00:45:55,796 --> 00:45:58,668
- [Man] Yeah, that's good.

907
00:45:58,712 --> 00:46:00,409
Kick off that lamp.

908
00:46:01,584 --> 00:46:03,108
Let's do a sound check
on her, all right?

909
00:46:03,151 --> 00:46:05,458
- [Crewman] All right.

910
00:46:05,501 --> 00:46:07,721
- [Man] That's good.

911
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,549
Oh, that's too bright.

912
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:12,117
- Oh, my god.

913
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:12,900
Come on, honey.

914
00:46:12,944 --> 00:46:14,554
Hurry, hurry.

915
00:46:14,597 --> 00:46:15,816
You don't know when
you're coming on.

916
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:16,730
You could be right at the top.

917
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,601
So, we don't want to miss it.

918
00:46:18,645 --> 00:46:19,864
- Can I get anybody
something else to drink?

919
00:46:19,907 --> 00:46:20,690
- No, no, no.

920
00:46:20,734 --> 00:46:21,474
Go sit down.

921
00:46:21,517 --> 00:46:22,388
Watch your show.

922
00:46:22,431 --> 00:46:23,302
Now, this is your moment.

923
00:46:23,345 --> 00:46:24,259
- Come sit down.

924
00:46:24,303 --> 00:46:25,391
- I got my drink.

925
00:46:25,434 --> 00:46:26,218
I'm fine.

926
00:46:27,436 --> 00:46:30,613
- I hope I have
enough makeup on.

927
00:46:30,657 --> 00:46:31,397
- Am I late?

928
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,441
- No.

929
00:46:32,485 --> 00:46:34,008
It's just now starting.

930
00:46:34,052 --> 00:46:36,402
- [Man On TV] Corporal Lindsey
Scott, Marine Corps prisoner.

931
00:46:36,445 --> 00:46:38,099
- There's my baby.

932
00:46:38,143 --> 00:46:39,492
I'm gonna marry him.

933
00:46:39,535 --> 00:46:40,710
[laughs]

934
00:46:40,754 --> 00:46:43,670
He could put his shoes
under my bed any time.

935
00:46:43,713 --> 00:46:45,411
- Aunt Lily.

936
00:46:45,454 --> 00:46:47,892
- [Man On TV] Scott was court
martialed, found guilty,

937
00:46:47,935 --> 00:46:50,590
and sentenced to 30
years at hard labor.

938
00:46:50,633 --> 00:46:53,680
It happened the night
of April 20th, 1983.

939
00:46:53,723 --> 00:46:57,031
- [Lindsey On TV] In a situation
like this, nobody wins.

940
00:46:57,075 --> 00:47:01,166
The victim doesn't win, I
don't win being innocent.

941
00:47:01,209 --> 00:47:04,082
I just hope everything
straightens itself out.

942
00:47:04,125 --> 00:47:05,648
- [Man On TV] The military
revue board has ruled

943
00:47:05,692 --> 00:47:07,955
that Scott is entitled
to a Dubay hearing.

944
00:47:07,999 --> 00:47:10,218
Not a new trial, but
a hearing to decide

945
00:47:10,262 --> 00:47:12,742
whether he received
a proper defense.

946
00:47:12,786 --> 00:47:14,657
- I guess they didn't
need my interview.

947
00:47:14,701 --> 00:47:16,355
- [Man On TV] He
may get a new trial.

948
00:47:16,398 --> 00:47:19,358
The Marine Corps has
declined to comment.

949
00:47:19,401 --> 00:47:20,881
- Millions of people
now are gonna know about

950
00:47:20,925 --> 00:47:23,057
the Lindsey Scott case.

951
00:47:23,101 --> 00:47:24,885
- That's right, honey.

952
00:47:31,457 --> 00:47:32,197
- Hmm.

953
00:47:39,378 --> 00:47:40,248
Oh, honey.

954
00:47:40,292 --> 00:47:43,469
I feel like such a proud fool.

955
00:47:43,512 --> 00:47:46,341
Inviting everybody over
here seeing me on TV

956
00:47:46,385 --> 00:47:49,431
like I'm Betty
Davis or something.

957
00:47:49,475 --> 00:47:54,436
- Honey, this is an incredible
thing and you made it happen.

958
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,047
So, congratulations.

959
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,877
- Thanks, honey.

960
00:48:01,487 --> 00:48:02,270
Oh, well.

961
00:48:03,619 --> 00:48:05,404
That was my big debut.

962
00:48:06,622 --> 00:48:10,017
[slow trumpet music]

963
00:48:10,061 --> 00:48:11,801
- [Crowd] Free Lindsey Scott.

964
00:48:11,845 --> 00:48:13,673
Free Lindsey Scott.

965
00:48:13,716 --> 00:48:14,979
Free Lindsey Scott.

966
00:48:15,022 --> 00:48:17,546
- Wow, all this for
a Dubay hearing.

967
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:20,332
- It's the power of 60 Minutes.

968
00:48:27,861 --> 00:48:31,952
- After April 22, did you next
have a meeting of substance

969
00:48:31,996 --> 00:48:35,129
with Mr. Kuhnke where
presentation of evidence

970
00:48:35,173 --> 00:48:39,090
or exploration of
defenses was discussed?

971
00:48:39,133 --> 00:48:40,569
- I didn't, sir.

972
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:42,528
- Never again?

973
00:48:43,877 --> 00:48:45,618
- Never again, sir.

974
00:48:46,532 --> 00:48:49,796
- Could you elaborate
on this, Private?

975
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:51,189
- Well, sir.

976
00:48:51,232 --> 00:48:55,323
I asked Mr. Kuhnke by
telephone several times

977
00:48:55,367 --> 00:48:57,238
to bring in the witnesses.

978
00:48:57,282 --> 00:49:01,329
Mr. Kuhnke repeatedly told
me not to worry about it

979
00:49:01,373 --> 00:49:05,594
'cause he didn't think the
case would go to trial.

980
00:49:08,641 --> 00:49:11,383
- Private Scott,
in your estimation,

981
00:49:11,426 --> 00:49:14,125
did you have 20 visits
to Mr. Kuhnke's office?

982
00:49:14,168 --> 00:49:15,561
- No.

983
00:49:15,604 --> 00:49:19,565
- Did you have 10
visits to his office?

984
00:49:19,608 --> 00:49:20,392
- No.

985
00:49:22,263 --> 00:49:25,005
- Well, how many visits did
you have alone with Mr. Kuhnke

986
00:49:25,049 --> 00:49:29,227
where you maintained
your innocence and
discussed your case?

987
00:49:30,576 --> 00:49:31,359
- One.

988
00:49:32,534 --> 00:49:36,277
- And that's your
testimony under oath?

989
00:49:36,321 --> 00:49:37,452
- Yes, it is.

990
00:49:41,413 --> 00:49:43,763
- Mr. Kuhnke, in going
to trial you stated

991
00:49:43,806 --> 00:49:45,634
you didn't prep any
of the witnesses?

992
00:49:45,678 --> 00:49:46,984
- That's right.

993
00:49:48,028 --> 00:49:49,073
I had talked.

994
00:49:50,074 --> 00:49:50,813
I had...

995
00:49:50,857 --> 00:49:52,032
- Wait, wait.

996
00:49:52,076 --> 00:49:55,427
What was Private
Scott charged with?

997
00:49:55,470 --> 00:49:59,431
- Attempted murder, rape,
sodomy, forceful abduction.

998
00:50:00,693 --> 00:50:02,390
- And you didn't prep
any of the witnesses?

999
00:50:02,434 --> 00:50:05,480
- I didn't prep them, no.

1000
00:50:05,524 --> 00:50:07,787
- Did you prep Private Scott?

1001
00:50:09,571 --> 00:50:10,616
- I didn't have to.

1002
00:50:10,659 --> 00:50:11,443
- Why not?

1003
00:50:13,445 --> 00:50:15,882
- He professed his innocence

1004
00:50:17,275 --> 00:50:20,017
and I told him to
tell the truth.

1005
00:50:21,888 --> 00:50:22,671
- Okay.

1006
00:50:23,933 --> 00:50:24,717
All right.

1007
00:50:25,848 --> 00:50:28,416
Let me think, let me think.

1008
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:32,377
Okay, on April 20th I
arrested both these guys

1009
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:34,074
for shoplifting.

1010
00:50:34,118 --> 00:50:35,380
And I made a note

1011
00:50:39,775 --> 00:50:42,517
about a third guy who I thought

1012
00:50:43,866 --> 00:50:45,781
was a part of the team.

1013
00:50:48,523 --> 00:50:50,177
Oh, see.

1014
00:50:50,221 --> 00:50:51,091
Here it is.

1015
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:54,007
This note, this guy.

1016
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,965
This is Lindsey Scott.

1017
00:50:56,009 --> 00:50:57,402
I am sure of it.

1018
00:50:58,577 --> 00:50:59,621
- You'll testify to that?

1019
00:50:59,665 --> 00:51:01,188
- Are you kidding
will I testify?

1020
00:51:01,232 --> 00:51:03,321
You bet I will testify.

1021
00:51:03,364 --> 00:51:05,801
- And it is now your
testimony, under oath,

1022
00:51:05,845 --> 00:51:08,804
that on the night
of April 20th, 1983,

1023
00:51:08,848 --> 00:51:11,633
between the hours of
eight and 8:30 p.m.,

1024
00:51:11,677 --> 00:51:16,247
one Lindsey Scott was present
at a Zayre's Department Store?

1025
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:17,596
- That's correct.

1026
00:51:19,032 --> 00:51:20,468
- Thank you, Ms. Hills.

1027
00:51:20,512 --> 00:51:22,122
You may step down.

1028
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:25,169
[people chattering]

1029
00:51:38,747 --> 00:51:41,359
Your Honor, the
defense rests its case

1030
00:51:41,402 --> 00:51:43,317
and moves for a
dismissal of all charges

1031
00:51:43,361 --> 00:51:45,363
against Lindsey Scott.

1032
00:51:45,406 --> 00:51:48,409
- We'll take a recess
while I make my decision.

1033
00:51:48,453 --> 00:51:50,281
[gavel bangs]

1034
00:51:50,324 --> 00:51:52,718
[tense music]

1035
00:52:16,524 --> 00:52:19,527
The defense motion for a
dismissal of the charges

1036
00:52:19,571 --> 00:52:22,487
against Private Scott is denied.

1037
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:23,836
I have no authority beyond that

1038
00:52:23,879 --> 00:52:25,533
which is given me in the order.

1039
00:52:25,577 --> 00:52:28,493
However, given the
facts of this case,

1040
00:52:28,536 --> 00:52:30,756
I am recommending
that this be referred

1041
00:52:30,799 --> 00:52:33,062
to General Tumi for review.

1042
00:52:35,674 --> 00:52:38,111
- Your Honor, we feel
that freeing Private Scott

1043
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,461
to his family with
appropriate restrictions

1044
00:52:40,505 --> 00:52:42,333
is in the interest of justice.

1045
00:52:42,376 --> 00:52:43,551
- I'm sorry, Counselor.

1046
00:52:43,595 --> 00:52:46,337
I have no authority to
grant such a request.

1047
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:48,469
It'll have to be
up to General Tumi.

1048
00:52:48,513 --> 00:52:50,645
[gavel bangs]

1049
00:52:50,689 --> 00:52:52,256
- The man sat on
this case for months,

1050
00:52:52,299 --> 00:52:55,520
now he says he doesn't have
the power to make a decision.

1051
00:52:55,563 --> 00:52:57,086
Back to square one.

1052
00:52:58,784 --> 00:53:01,874
[slow trumpet music]

1053
00:53:13,407 --> 00:53:16,236
[phone ringing]

1054
00:53:18,107 --> 00:53:19,457
Hello?

1055
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,720
- [Man On Phone] Rapist
loving nigger bitch.

1056
00:53:21,763 --> 00:53:23,287
You're gonna die!

1057
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:25,419
- Wrong number.

1058
00:53:28,248 --> 00:53:29,815
- [Paul] Who was it?

1059
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:33,253
- Can I lie?

1060
00:53:33,297 --> 00:53:34,080
- No.

1061
00:53:36,561 --> 00:53:38,389
- Not even a little?

1062
00:53:43,002 --> 00:53:45,874
It started unpleasant
and it ended even worse.

1063
00:53:45,918 --> 00:53:48,399
- Well, you got your publicity.

1064
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:52,446
Now, you got your threats.

1065
00:53:54,622 --> 00:53:56,363
- These threats must mean
that we've touched a nerve

1066
00:53:56,407 --> 00:53:57,625
and as far as I'm concerned

1067
00:53:57,669 --> 00:54:00,019
that means we're
on the right track.

1068
00:54:00,062 --> 00:54:02,717
- [Paul] What if someone
decides to do something more?

1069
00:54:02,761 --> 00:54:04,893
- Look, I can't be concerned
about all that now.

1070
00:54:04,937 --> 00:54:07,679
We've got bigger
things to worry about.

1071
00:54:07,722 --> 00:54:08,723
- Than what?

1072
00:54:10,334 --> 00:54:14,903
What's bigger than the safety
and welfare of our family?

1073
00:54:14,947 --> 00:54:15,948
[phone ringing]

1074
00:54:15,991 --> 00:54:16,731
- [Lori] I'll get it.

1075
00:54:16,775 --> 00:54:17,993
- I'll get it.

1076
00:54:24,217 --> 00:54:26,045
Racism hotline.

1077
00:54:26,088 --> 00:54:26,828
Oh, gosh.

1078
00:54:26,872 --> 00:54:27,612
I'm sorry.

1079
00:54:27,655 --> 00:54:28,526
Just a sec.

1080
00:54:29,483 --> 00:54:30,528
It's Tanya.

1081
00:54:30,571 --> 00:54:31,529
- Tanya?

1082
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:37,056
Hey.

1083
00:54:38,318 --> 00:54:39,188
Yeah, girl.

1084
00:54:40,451 --> 00:54:44,237
We've been receiving
some fan appreciation.

1085
00:54:47,022 --> 00:54:50,112
- Having reviewed the material
from the Dubay hearing

1086
00:54:50,156 --> 00:54:53,420
of the United States
versus Lindsey Scott,

1087
00:54:53,464 --> 00:54:57,119
this court has, in a
two-to-one majority decision,

1088
00:54:57,163 --> 00:55:00,471
decided to uphold
the prior conviction.

1089
00:55:03,561 --> 00:55:06,520
[subdued music]

1090
00:55:06,564 --> 00:55:08,348
- [Lori] Can I come
to the dance with you?

1091
00:55:08,392 --> 00:55:09,610
- [Terry] This is for grownups.

1092
00:55:09,654 --> 00:55:11,917
- [Lori] I won't get in the way.

1093
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,701
- If you behave, I'll bring
you back some licorice,

1094
00:55:13,745 --> 00:55:14,528
all right?

1095
00:55:15,616 --> 00:55:17,139
- My sweater.

1096
00:55:17,183 --> 00:55:19,577
I forgot my sweater
at the church.

1097
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:21,274
- [sighs] We'll
get it next week.

1098
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,102
Ain't nobody gonna take you
sweater from the church.

1099
00:55:23,145 --> 00:55:24,451
- My daddy gave me that sweater.

1100
00:55:24,495 --> 00:55:27,715
That's the sweater
my daddy gave me.

1101
00:55:27,759 --> 00:55:30,152
- Nobody's gonna take the
sweater your daddy gave you.

1102
00:55:30,196 --> 00:55:32,416
- What if it gets dirty?

1103
00:55:32,459 --> 00:55:35,984
It ain't gonna smell
like my daddy no more.

1104
00:55:37,464 --> 00:55:38,247
- All right.

1105
00:55:38,291 --> 00:55:39,553
I want you to go home.

1106
00:55:39,597 --> 00:55:40,598
Start helping your
mama make dinner.

1107
00:55:40,641 --> 00:55:42,251
By the time you
lay down tonight,

1108
00:55:42,295 --> 00:55:45,472
I'll have the sweater
for you, all right?

1109
00:55:45,516 --> 00:55:46,430
Get on now.

1110
00:56:07,494 --> 00:56:10,541
[people shouting]

1111
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:18,636
[tires squealing]

1112
00:56:52,931 --> 00:56:54,106
- You want your kids growing up

1113
00:56:54,149 --> 00:56:57,414
with this kind of
garbage in their faces?

1114
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:02,810
- No, but I damn sure ain't
gonna let them intimidate me.

1115
00:57:04,508 --> 00:57:05,944
Let's go to bed.

1116
00:57:09,251 --> 00:57:10,601
Come on, girls.

1117
00:57:10,644 --> 00:57:11,819
Let's go.

1118
00:57:11,863 --> 00:57:14,474
[wood thumps]

1119
00:57:35,539 --> 00:57:36,365
- Teresa?

1120
00:57:38,542 --> 00:57:41,414
Teresa, why don't you come help?

1121
00:57:44,548 --> 00:57:45,592
Hey.

1122
00:57:47,812 --> 00:57:49,770
You can read that later.

1123
00:57:49,814 --> 00:57:54,035
Right now your mom and I
would like your help, okay?

1124
00:57:55,428 --> 00:57:58,300
[tense music]

1125
00:57:58,344 --> 00:57:59,301
Lori.

1126
00:57:59,345 --> 00:58:00,781
- Mama?

1127
00:58:00,825 --> 00:58:01,608
- Mama?

1128
00:58:02,957 --> 00:58:03,741
- Mama.

1129
00:58:05,612 --> 00:58:06,439
- [Paul] Get a pillow.

1130
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:07,266
Call 911.

1131
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:12,750
- [Woman On PA] Hospital
X-Ray tech to ICU.

1132
00:58:12,793 --> 00:58:15,143
Hospital X-Ray tech to ICU.

1133
00:58:18,364 --> 00:58:21,280
[knocking on door]

1134
00:58:25,719 --> 00:58:26,807
- Let's talk.

1135
00:58:28,766 --> 00:58:30,768
Your test results are in.

1136
00:58:30,811 --> 00:58:31,508
- Oh.

1137
00:58:34,467 --> 00:58:37,296
- You have cancer in your liver.

1138
00:58:39,907 --> 00:58:42,954
- Well, how do we fix that?

1139
00:58:42,997 --> 00:58:46,131
- Well, there are a
number of treatments.

1140
00:58:46,174 --> 00:58:48,568
They're all invasive.

1141
00:58:48,612 --> 00:58:50,831
They're all gonna
make you very sick

1142
00:58:50,875 --> 00:58:54,443
and they're not gonna
change the outcome.

1143
00:59:00,449 --> 00:59:02,234
- What does that mean?

1144
00:59:04,628 --> 00:59:08,806
- I'm sorry to say this,
but your cancer is terminal.

1145
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:14,463
Now, I want you to stay in the
hospital for a week or two.

1146
00:59:14,507 --> 00:59:17,554
I want to try and boost
your immune system.

1147
00:59:17,597 --> 00:59:20,687
The important thing
now is to get rest

1148
00:59:20,731 --> 00:59:23,864
and to conserve your energy.

1149
00:59:23,908 --> 00:59:27,651
- Doc, could you just give
us a little time alone?

1150
00:59:27,694 --> 00:59:28,608
- Yeah.

1151
00:59:28,652 --> 00:59:30,349
- Yeah, just a minute alone.

1152
00:59:30,392 --> 00:59:31,350
That's all.

1153
00:59:31,393 --> 00:59:32,133
- [Doctor] I'll just be...

1154
00:59:32,177 --> 00:59:32,960
- Thanks.

1155
00:59:44,624 --> 00:59:45,407
Honey.

1156
00:59:48,106 --> 00:59:50,587
- Don't look at me like that.

1157
01:00:04,644 --> 01:00:06,994
I have a trial to prepare for.

1158
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:18,440
[subdued music]

1159
01:00:20,921 --> 01:00:24,708
Now, you've gotta let me
tell the kids in my own time.

1160
01:00:24,751 --> 01:00:25,578
Promise?

1161
01:00:29,364 --> 01:00:30,844
Where are we going?

1162
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:41,725
What is this?

1163
01:00:45,424 --> 01:00:49,646
- A little happy place to
hold onto with all your might.

1164
01:00:51,778 --> 01:00:52,866
- What is it?

1165
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:55,652
Whose is it?

1166
01:00:56,827 --> 01:00:59,046
- Well, it's ours.

1167
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:02,310
Well, it's not
actually ours yet, but.

1168
01:01:03,268 --> 01:01:04,748
- Paul, say you're joking.

1169
01:01:04,791 --> 01:01:06,924
Tell me you're joking.

1170
01:01:06,967 --> 01:01:08,403
- Come on.

1171
01:01:08,447 --> 01:01:09,666
- Paul.

1172
01:01:09,709 --> 01:01:10,449
- [Paul] What?

1173
01:01:10,492 --> 01:01:11,493
Come on.

1174
01:01:11,537 --> 01:01:12,407
Come on, girlfriend.

1175
01:01:12,451 --> 01:01:13,452
We're burning daylight.

1176
01:01:13,495 --> 01:01:14,235
- You didn't.

1177
01:01:14,279 --> 01:01:15,759
I can't believe it.

1178
01:01:23,636 --> 01:01:24,942
It's beautiful.

1179
01:01:24,985 --> 01:01:26,421
- [Paul] Mm-hmm.

1180
01:01:40,522 --> 01:01:42,916
- [Both] Welcome home, Mama.

1181
01:01:44,178 --> 01:01:46,485
[laughs]

1182
01:01:46,528 --> 01:01:49,096
- [Dena] Don't you love it?

1183
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:50,837
- I love it.

1184
01:01:50,881 --> 01:01:52,578
- Come on, have a seat.

1185
01:01:52,621 --> 01:01:54,406
- Congratulations, Mama.

1186
01:01:54,449 --> 01:01:56,495
Isn't it the best?

1187
01:01:56,538 --> 01:01:57,496
- It's the best.

1188
01:01:57,539 --> 01:01:59,019
- See?

1189
01:01:59,063 --> 01:02:00,194
It's big enough for the girls
to have their own bedrooms.

1190
01:02:00,238 --> 01:02:02,675
Office for you, office for me.

1191
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,416
And it's so private.

1192
01:02:04,459 --> 01:02:08,812
Bad guys are gonna have
a hard time finding us.

1193
01:02:08,855 --> 01:02:10,770
- It's beautiful.

1194
01:02:10,814 --> 01:02:12,337
You're beautiful.

1195
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:14,513
I love you.

1196
01:02:16,297 --> 01:02:18,299
I love you so very much.

1197
01:02:22,173 --> 01:02:22,956
Thank you.

1198
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:38,276
- Here we go.

1199
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:39,799
Military's equivalent
of the Supreme Court.

1200
01:02:39,843 --> 01:02:41,932
We lose here, we're done.

1201
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:47,067
Myers is presenting
the opening statement.

1202
01:02:54,074 --> 01:02:56,468
- Every man has a
right to a fair trial

1203
01:02:56,511 --> 01:03:01,168
and a fair trial includes
adequate legal counsel.

1204
01:03:01,212 --> 01:03:03,040
If the court case
were a horse race,

1205
01:03:03,083 --> 01:03:05,172
this would be like putting
one jockey on a track

1206
01:03:05,216 --> 01:03:06,565
without a horse.

1207
01:03:06,608 --> 01:03:09,481
That is not fair,
that is not legal.

1208
01:03:09,524 --> 01:03:12,789
That is not how our
justice system works.

1209
01:03:14,268 --> 01:03:17,706
Lindsey Scott's original
defense lawyer, Ervin Kuhnke,

1210
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:21,536
did not prepare an alibi defense
for the inexplicable reason

1211
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:25,236
that he didn't think the
case would go to trial.

1212
01:03:25,279 --> 01:03:27,455
The linkage between
Mr. Kuhnke's conduct

1213
01:03:27,499 --> 01:03:30,502
and the conclusion of the
case was palpable and clear.

1214
01:03:30,545 --> 01:03:32,765
We end up with no
preparation whatsoever

1215
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:35,637
and we end up with a conviction.

1216
01:03:37,117 --> 01:03:38,815
The practice of
criminal law involves

1217
01:03:38,858 --> 01:03:40,686
getting your shoes dirty.

1218
01:03:40,729 --> 01:03:43,994
All Mr. Kuhnke did
was sit at his desk.

1219
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:07,931
[knocking on door]

1220
01:04:07,974 --> 01:04:08,975
- Mr. Myers.

1221
01:04:09,933 --> 01:04:11,586
- Hey, Lori.

1222
01:04:11,630 --> 01:04:14,111
After all this time, it's Gary.

1223
01:04:18,463 --> 01:04:22,380
- Listen, I spoke to my
source at the Washington Post.

1224
01:04:22,423 --> 01:04:25,339
She heard about a
Major Ron McNeil

1225
01:04:25,383 --> 01:04:27,341
who's at the Marine JAG
Office at Camp Lejueune.

1226
01:04:27,385 --> 01:04:29,300
Have you heard of him?

1227
01:04:29,343 --> 01:04:31,519
- Toughest prosecutor
the marine Corps has.

1228
01:04:31,563 --> 01:04:32,869
What about him?

1229
01:04:34,305 --> 01:04:36,481
- Well, she heard that
he's been ordered to report

1230
01:04:36,524 --> 01:04:39,788
to Quantico to start
prepping a big case.

1231
01:04:43,662 --> 01:04:45,969
- You know what this means?

1232
01:04:47,492 --> 01:04:51,191
- Looks like we're winning
the appeal and they're scared.

1233
01:04:56,588 --> 01:04:57,371
Good work.

1234
01:04:59,069 --> 01:05:00,070
- Thank you.

1235
01:05:04,596 --> 01:05:05,858
- I can't believe it.

1236
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:06,641
Finally.

1237
01:05:06,685 --> 01:05:07,947
Oh, John.

1238
01:05:07,991 --> 01:05:08,817
Good job.

1239
01:05:12,256 --> 01:05:13,648
Thank you.

1240
01:05:13,692 --> 01:05:15,259
Yeah.

1241
01:05:15,302 --> 01:05:17,087
I'll talk to you soon.

1242
01:05:23,136 --> 01:05:24,355
It's official.

1243
01:05:25,443 --> 01:05:28,228
Lindsey Scott is coming home.

1244
01:05:28,272 --> 01:05:29,534
At least for now.

1245
01:05:29,577 --> 01:05:31,928
- I'm sick and tired
of Lindsey Scott.

1246
01:05:31,971 --> 01:05:32,841
- Oh, honey.

1247
01:05:32,885 --> 01:05:33,668
Don't be such a sourpuss.

1248
01:05:33,712 --> 01:05:34,539
Ow.

1249
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:39,631
- Mama, you don't look so good.

1250
01:05:39,674 --> 01:05:41,198
- What?

1251
01:05:41,241 --> 01:05:42,547
- You heard me.

1252
01:05:45,028 --> 01:05:46,507
- Oh, don't be such
a sourpuss, honey.

1253
01:05:46,551 --> 01:05:49,423
We have so much to
celebrate about.

01:05:51,556 --> 01:05:53,950
[door creaks]

1255
01:05:57,127 --> 01:06:00,521
- Why are you in
here so much lately?

1256
01:06:00,565 --> 01:06:03,655
- Just trying to get settled in.

1257
01:06:03,698 --> 01:06:06,179
Taking on some extra clients.

1258
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:10,836
- That's not what
I'm asking about.

1259
01:06:13,491 --> 01:06:14,492
Mama's sick.

1260
01:06:17,277 --> 01:06:21,499
- Yeah, well she's been
under a lot of stress lately.

1261
01:06:22,543 --> 01:06:23,762
- Really sick.

1262
01:06:28,158 --> 01:06:29,507
Don't you care?

1263
01:06:34,642 --> 01:06:35,948
- Clean sheets.

1264
01:06:36,862 --> 01:06:37,994
Dena did the laundry.

1265
01:06:38,037 --> 01:06:39,517
Can you believe it?

1266
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:40,605
- Sweetheart.

1267
01:06:40,648 --> 01:06:41,388
- Yeah?

1268
01:06:41,432 --> 01:06:42,737
- Teresa knows.

1269
01:06:44,261 --> 01:06:45,523
- Did you tell her?

1270
01:06:45,566 --> 01:06:48,526
- Two-stepped around it.

1271
01:06:48,569 --> 01:06:49,309
But, I think it's time.

1272
01:06:49,353 --> 01:06:51,094
She's got to be told.

1273
01:06:51,137 --> 01:06:53,139
- I'm just waiting
for the right time.

1274
01:06:53,183 --> 01:06:55,794
- Honey, there is no right time.

1275
01:06:58,579 --> 01:06:59,624

- Excuse me, Dr. Sturla?

1279
01:07:23,691 --> 01:07:25,737
- [Dr. Sturla] Mm-hmm?

1280
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:28,000
- I'm Lori Jackson's daughter.

1281
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:31,264
I need to talk to
you about my mother.

- Mm-hmm.

1285
01:07:41,622 --> 01:07:43,320

go through that document

1286
01:07:43,363 --> 01:07:45,583
and anywhere you see
Ruby Hills' name,

1287
01:07:45,626 --> 01:07:47,193
I want you to
highlight it for me.

1288
01:07:47,237 --> 01:07:48,586
- [Aunt Lily] All right.

1289
01:07:48,629 --> 01:07:49,369
- Coffee?

1290
01:07:49,413 --> 01:07:50,283
- Yeah, thanks.

1291
01:07:50,327 --> 01:07:51,589
- I hope it's not too strong.

1292
01:07:51,632 --> 01:07:53,243
This stuff will make
you stand up for sure.

1293
01:07:53,286 --> 01:07:55,984

[door slams]

1296
01:08:03,470 --> 01:08:06,473
Hey, I was wondering
where you were.

1297
01:08:08,562 --> 01:08:10,608
- I went to the hospital.

1298
01:08:10,651 --> 01:08:12,392
- What happened, baby?

1299
01:08:12,436 --> 01:08:13,828
- I had a talk with your doctor.

1300
01:08:13,872 --> 01:08:17,963
He said I needed to have
a conversation with you.

1301
01:08:21,488 --> 01:08:23,534
- I think we should have
this conversation...

1302
01:08:23,577 --> 01:08:24,926
Sweetheart, we have company.

1303
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:25,710
We should just go in...

1304
01:08:25,753 --> 01:08:27,581
- I don't wan to go.

1305
01:08:29,714 --> 01:08:31,846

01:08:35,285 --> 01:08:36,460
- I'm very sick.

1307

- I have cancer.

1309
01:09:00,527 --> 01:09:03,051
- What are they doing about it?

1310
01:09:04,444 --> 01:09:07,534
- There's nothing
they can do about it.

1311
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:11,451
- Why didn't you tell me?

1312
01:09:11,495 --> 01:09:12,539
Does Paul know.

1313
01:09:12,583 --> 01:09:13,584
Do you know?

Why didn't you tell me?

1315
01:09:23,115 --> 01:09:23,985
I'm your daughter!

1316
01:09:24,029 --> 01:09:25,422
I'm your family!

1317
01:09:25,465 --> 01:09:27,032

Baby, please.

You're right, I should've.

You know, I should've told you.

1326
01:09:38,957 --> 01:09:41,089
I should've told you.

1327

I just couldn't do it.

1328
01:09:43,527 --> 01:09:44,397
Oh, Teresa.

Easy, baby.

Easy.

Oh, Teresa, honey.

1334

- You're my daughter.

You know, you're
Mommy's sweetheart.

You're my baby.

1338
01:10:00,631 --> 01:10:03,286
I know how terrible
this is for you.

1339
01:10:03,329 --> 01:10:06,376

for you to be around.

And now I find out
you're never gonna be.

Good, actually.

- Hmm.

1347
01:11:10,048 --> 01:11:11,049
- It's just this weather.

1348
01:11:11,092 --> 01:11:13,791
It makes me feel
so old and gray.

1349

- You remember what
the Marine stands for?

- Protecting the Constitution,

1363
01:12:02,448 --> 01:12:04,450
protecting people who
can't protect themselves,

1364
01:12:04,494 --> 01:12:07,540
and being the best
man you can be.

1365
01:12:08,411 --> 01:12:09,412
- When we go in there today.

1366

all eyes are on you.

- Standard rape examination.

1376
01:12:34,088 --> 01:12:35,525
At the hospital,

1377
01:12:35,568 --> 01:12:37,265
certain items were
obtained form the victim.

1378
01:12:37,309 --> 01:12:40,051

pubic hair samples,

We also obtained samples
from Corporal Scott.

1381
01:12:45,622 --> 01:12:48,668
We sent it all to the FBI
laboratory in Washington D.C.

1382
01:12:48,712 --> 01:12:51,410
to look for basically
any cross-transfer

1383

of body fluids, fibers, hair.

1384
01:12:53,456 --> 01:12:56,067
Anything that might link
the suspect to the victim.

- [John] And what were the
results of your findings?

1386

- All the tests came back
negative or inconclusive.

- Now, concerning
the physical lineup.

1389
01:13:06,991 --> 01:13:09,428
After looking at the
men in the lineup,

1390
01:13:09,472 --> 01:13:13,780
didn't she pick out two men
then turn to you and say,

1391
01:13:13,824 --> 01:13:15,826
"I'm sorry, I can't be sure,

1392
01:13:15,869 --> 01:13:18,872
but number five
scares me the most"?

1393
01:13:21,092 --> 01:13:22,572
- Her closing statement.

1394
01:13:22,615 --> 01:13:23,399
Yes, sir.

1395
01:13:24,922 --> 01:13:26,445
- Now, Is that your standard
for a positive identification

1396
01:13:26,489 --> 01:13:27,490
in a rape case?

1397
01:13:31,798 --> 01:13:32,582
- No, sir.

1398
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:36,150
- [John] Well, thank
you for your honesty.

1399
01:13:36,194 --> 01:13:38,196
I have nothing further for
this witness, Your Honor.

1400
01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:40,633

Honey?

Shh.

1411
01:14:39,649 --> 01:14:41,085
Okay, it's okay.

everything goes all right

get back to your
nice warm house,

1422
01:15:09,548 --> 01:15:12,290
and I'm gonna call you later
and give you the good results.

1423

I'm gonna ask you a
very important question.

1427
01:15:38,011 --> 01:15:39,752
I want you to look
around this courtroom

1428
01:15:39,796 --> 01:15:43,974
and I want you to point to
the individual who raped you,

1429
01:15:44,017 --> 01:15:47,368
who forced you to commit
sodomy, who stabbed you,

1430
01:15:47,412 --> 01:15:51,721
slashed you in the neck, and
left you in the woods to die.

1431
01:15:51,764 --> 01:15:53,679
Would you point to him?

1432
01:16:00,512 --> 01:16:01,992
Let the record reflect
that the witness

1433
01:16:02,035 --> 01:16:05,561
has identified the
accused, Corporal Scott.

1434
01:16:07,606 --> 01:16:11,697
- Ms. Ames, when you
viewed the physical lineup,

1435
01:16:11,741 --> 01:16:13,873
you became aware of the
fact that Agent Lindner

1436
01:16:13,917 --> 01:16:16,180
wanted to be sure about
your identification

1437
01:16:16,223 --> 01:16:17,224
of the individual.

1438
01:16:17,268 --> 01:16:18,661
- That's correct.

1439
01:16:18,704 --> 01:16:22,490
- Isn't that why you said,
I'm sorry, I can't be sure,

1440
01:16:22,534 --> 01:16:24,667
because in your own mind
you weren't completely sure

1441
01:16:24,710 --> 01:16:27,147
of your identification?

1442
01:16:27,191 --> 01:16:30,281
- I wasn't 100%, that's correct.

1443
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:33,197
- [Ron] How is it that
you could remember seeing

1444
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:37,854
Scott's face for sure on a
specific night years later?

1445
01:16:37,897 --> 01:16:40,987
- I found the arrest
records for that day.

1446
01:16:41,031 --> 01:16:45,122
It had photos of the two
busts I had made that day

1447
01:16:45,165 --> 01:16:49,039
and I remembered him in
conjunction with those two men.

1448
01:16:49,082 --> 01:16:51,432
- [Ron] How did
you remember him?

1449
01:16:51,476 --> 01:16:54,479
- Well, he was very
unusual looking.

1450
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:59,092
- Isn't it true that you were
prompted to provide an alibi

1451
01:16:59,136 --> 01:17:00,659
and that you aren't
really sure when, or if,

1452
01:17:00,703 --> 01:17:02,966
you saw Lindsey Scott?

1453
01:17:03,009 --> 01:17:04,532
- No, sir.

1454
01:17:04,576 --> 01:17:06,709
I know I saw him that night.

1455
01:17:08,362 --> 01:17:10,930
I just needed the
pictures to place him

1456
01:17:10,974 --> 01:17:12,758
on that specific day.

1457
01:17:12,802 --> 01:17:15,761
Those were the two
pictures of the two men

1458
01:17:15,805 --> 01:17:18,416
I had arrested that day.

1459
01:17:18,459 --> 01:17:21,680
I remembered Lindsey
Scott because I thought

1460
01:17:21,724 --> 01:17:24,683
he was a part of a
shoplifting team.

1461
01:17:27,947 --> 01:17:29,775
- We have no further
questions, Your Honor.

1462
01:17:29,819 --> 01:17:32,386
- You may step down, Ms. Hills.

1463
01:17:32,430 --> 01:17:35,433
[people chattering]

1464
01:17:43,615 --> 01:17:47,140
- Your Honor, the
defense rests its case.

1465
01:17:48,533 --> 01:17:49,577
- That went well.

1466
01:17:49,621 --> 01:17:51,014
- [Teresa] Mama.

1467
01:17:53,581 --> 01:17:55,148
- [Lori] Yeah, baby?

1468
01:17:56,541 --> 01:17:57,673
- Mama?

1469
01:17:57,716 --> 01:17:58,499
- Uh-huh.

1470
01:18:02,590 --> 01:18:04,418
What are you doing?

1471
01:18:04,462 --> 01:18:05,202
- I don't know.

1472
01:18:05,245 --> 01:18:07,465
What are you doing?

1473
01:18:07,508 --> 01:18:09,685
Where'd you get all this junk?

1474
01:18:09,728 --> 01:18:10,511
- Junk?

1475
01:18:11,730 --> 01:18:14,472
- Yes, this stuff
is older than I am.

1476
01:18:14,515 --> 01:18:16,517
Look at this dress here.

1477
01:18:19,433 --> 01:18:23,046
- I wore this when I brought
you home from the hospital.

1478
01:18:23,089 --> 01:18:27,354
You were all little and
helpless and quiet, for once.

1479
01:18:31,141 --> 01:18:32,969
- What are you gonna do with it?

1480
01:18:33,012 --> 01:18:34,710
- I don't know.

1481
01:18:34,753 --> 01:18:36,363
Saint Vincent will take it.

1482
01:18:36,407 --> 01:18:38,104
I've been telling Paul I'd
get rid of some of this...

1483
01:18:38,148 --> 01:18:38,888
- No.

1484
01:18:38,931 --> 01:18:41,064
You can't throw it away.

1485
01:18:41,107 --> 01:18:42,413
- [Lori] Well, why not?

1486
01:18:42,456 --> 01:18:44,241
- Maybe I want it.

1487
01:18:44,284 --> 01:18:46,417
You know, my later years.

1488
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:49,376
Might enter a pregnancy pageant.

1489
01:18:49,420 --> 01:18:52,292
[Lori laughing]

1490
01:18:53,206 --> 01:18:54,642
- I don't think.

1491
01:18:56,079 --> 01:18:57,776
You want to see something funny?

1492
01:18:57,820 --> 01:18:59,343
- Sure.

1493
01:18:59,386 --> 01:19:00,170
- Okay.

1494
01:19:05,828 --> 01:19:06,654
Oh.

1495
01:19:11,616 --> 01:19:13,052
Hold out your hand.

1496
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:22,627
Now, let me see.

1497
01:19:22,670 --> 01:19:24,455
These are your teeth.

1498
01:19:24,498 --> 01:19:27,893
Two from you and two from Dena.

1499
01:19:27,937 --> 01:19:29,590
And my Tooth Fairy
paid good money.

1500
01:19:29,634 --> 01:19:32,898
- [laughs] I remember.

1501
01:19:42,908 --> 01:19:45,171
- This was Dena's.

1502
01:19:45,215 --> 01:19:49,436
It took me seven years to
get this away from that girl.

1503
01:19:53,353 --> 01:19:55,921
I want you to save this for her.

1504
01:19:57,967 --> 01:20:01,579
You know, your baby
sister's not like you.

1505
01:20:01,622 --> 01:20:03,973
She needs a lot of validation.

1506
01:20:06,453 --> 01:20:08,586
I don't want a day to go by

1507
01:20:08,629 --> 01:20:11,415
that you don't
compliment her, you hear?

1508
01:20:11,458 --> 01:20:14,287
[subdued music]

1509
01:20:21,468 --> 01:20:22,513
Okay.

1510
01:20:24,515 --> 01:20:28,345
We've gotta clean
all this stuff up.

1511
01:20:28,388 --> 01:20:29,781
I have to go soon.

1512
01:20:34,177 --> 01:20:35,526
One last thing.

1513
01:20:37,702 --> 01:20:40,444
You know what this means to me.

1514
01:20:43,926 --> 01:20:46,015
What it represents to me.

1515
01:20:52,499 --> 01:20:57,156
You know that we will
both be looking over you.

1516
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:57,983
Always.

1517
01:21:01,334 --> 01:21:02,422
Always, baby.

1518
01:21:05,904 --> 01:21:07,993
[crying]

1519
01:21:09,516 --> 01:21:11,562
- [Teresa] I love you.

1520
01:21:13,172 --> 01:21:14,565
- I love you, too.

1521
01:21:15,958 --> 01:21:17,655
Mommy loves you, too.

1522
01:21:19,004 --> 01:21:20,353
Oh, I love you.

1523
01:21:22,312 --> 01:21:24,618
You take care of your sister.

1524
01:21:31,495 --> 01:21:33,279
- The surgery should
remove the blockage.

1525
01:21:33,323 --> 01:21:35,499
Now, I know it's hard,
but try and relax.

1526
01:21:35,542 --> 01:21:37,370
I'll see you in the
recovery room afterwards.

1527
01:21:37,414 --> 01:21:38,415
- Okay.

1528
01:21:38,458 --> 01:21:39,459
Thanks, Doc.

1529
01:21:45,552 --> 01:21:46,597
You know, this is
going to be over

1530
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:49,208
before you know it, darling.

1531
01:21:49,252 --> 01:21:50,122
Piece of cake.

1532
01:21:50,166 --> 01:21:51,558
Don't worry.

1533
01:21:51,602 --> 01:21:53,691
- Jury's deliberating, so
have CNN on when I come out.

1534
01:21:53,734 --> 01:21:54,692
- [Paul] Okay, honey.

1535
01:21:54,735 --> 01:21:56,128
I love you.

1536
01:21:56,172 --> 01:21:57,782
- [Lori] I love you.

1537
01:22:04,963 --> 01:22:08,401
[machine beeping steadily]

1538
01:22:13,711 --> 01:22:16,844
- [Dr. Sturla] All
right, here we go.

1539
01:22:28,987 --> 01:22:31,468
[solemn music]

1540
01:22:33,339 --> 01:22:34,558
- Hey, minnow.

1541
01:22:36,125 --> 01:22:37,561
Look what I got.

1542
01:22:39,041 --> 01:22:40,085
Your sweater.

1543
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:42,348
Here we go.

1544
01:22:42,392 --> 01:22:43,697
[machine beeping rapidly]

1545
01:22:43,741 --> 01:22:47,614
- [Nurse] Doctor, her
vital signs are unstable.

1546
01:22:51,531 --> 01:22:54,752
[steady tone echoing]

1547
01:22:56,188 --> 01:22:59,061
- [Terry] Yeah, I
got your sweater.

1548
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:02,586
Come on, let's go.

1549
01:23:40,798 --> 01:23:44,497
[machine beeping steadily]

1550
01:23:53,289 --> 01:23:54,638
- [Reporter On TV] In
Quantico, Virginia,

1551
01:23:54,681 --> 01:23:57,162
the second court martial
of Corporal Lindsey Scott

1552
01:23:57,206 --> 01:23:58,729
is almost over.

1553
01:23:58,772 --> 01:24:00,557
The defense has rested its case

1554
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:03,908
and a verdict is
expected sometime today.

1555
01:24:03,951 --> 01:24:06,476
CIA operatives used
unmarked helicopters

1556
01:24:06,519 --> 01:24:08,391
to deliver explosives
and other supplies

1557
01:24:08,434 --> 01:24:11,742
to Contra rebel units
inside Nicaragua last year

1558
01:24:11,785 --> 01:24:14,658

ban on U.S.

- We have reached a verdict.

1562
01:24:44,166 --> 01:24:48,779
Corporal Lindsey Scott,
United States Marine Corps,

1563
01:24:48,822 --> 01:24:51,260
this court martial now
finds you of all charges

1564
01:24:51,303 --> 01:24:53,697
and specifications not guilty.

1565
01:24:59,224 --> 01:25:00,225
- Thank you.

1566
01:25:01,139 --> 01:25:04,055

01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:06,971
[triumphant music]

1568
01:25:37,175 --> 01:25:37,958
- Honey?

1569
01:25:45,444 --> 01:25:46,489
Hey.

1570
01:25:49,927 --> 01:25:50,710
- Hey.

1571
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:56,542
- How you doing?

1572
01:26:00,590 --> 01:26:03,810
- Tell me 10 things
you love about me.

1573
01:26:06,596 --> 01:26:07,597
- Right now?

1574
01:26:13,037 --> 01:26:14,386
I love your smile.

1575
01:26:16,258 --> 01:26:18,912
[subdued music]

1576
01:26:21,088 --> 01:26:24,004
I love the way you
brush your hair.

1577
01:26:29,140 --> 01:26:31,273
I love the way you smell.

1578
01:26:35,973 --> 01:26:38,062
I love the way you
hum those silly tunes

1579
01:26:38,105 --> 01:26:40,282
when you're in the shower.

1580
01:26:48,464 --> 01:26:49,856
I love your hands.

1581
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:53,599
How soft they are.

1582
01:27:00,606 --> 01:27:03,653
I love the way you
never give up on me,

1583
01:27:11,748 --> 01:27:13,271
and the children,

1584
01:27:15,012 --> 01:27:18,102
or anything else
that you believe in.

1585
01:27:23,325 --> 01:27:24,587
How many is that?

1586
01:27:28,982 --> 01:27:30,854
- I think two.

1587
01:27:30,897 --> 01:27:33,378
[both laugh]

1588
01:27:37,774 --> 01:27:38,557
- Hey, um,

1589
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:43,519
the verdict's in.

1590
01:27:46,391 --> 01:27:47,436
- I know.

1591
01:27:50,482 --> 01:27:51,527
I know.
