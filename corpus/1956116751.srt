Colonel just let them
out of the brig.

00:05:37,877 --> 00:05:40,245
They went AWOL during Normandy.

make it a mile.

Hey, a lot of men
were scared out there.

think were possible.

40
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:55,994
Yeah, lots of men died
out there on the beach,

41
00:05:55,996 --> 00:05:57,862
probably more than needed
to with guys running away

42
00:05:57,864 --> 00:06:00,264

helping their fellow man.

Nah, I don't got
a damn thing to say to you.

That's right, run away,
run away.

AWOL or not, those men
know how to handle a gun.

49
00:06:28,996 --> 00:06:31,829
Does make me wonder why they
ran away in the first place.

50
00:06:31,831 --> 00:06:34,632
Well, Colonel wants them
to redeem themselves,

51
00:06:34,634 --> 00:06:36,167
so, and he believes
they're good men.

52
00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:37,668
He's giving them
a second chance

53
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:40,170
'cause we're almost out of men.

54
00:06:40,172 --> 00:06:42,841

to turn yellow and run,

00:06:45,312 --> 00:06:47,112

what is the next assignment?

You're coming with us,
right, Captain?

60
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,925
That's why I volunteered.
This is your squad, right?

61
00:07:00,927 --> 00:07:04,661
That's what Colonel told us.

62
00:07:04,663 --> 00:07:06,764
Isn't that what he told you?

63
00:07:06,766 --> 00:07:08,901
Well, look,
I'm sorry I didn't

64
00:07:08,903 --> 00:07:10,836
talk with you
about this earlier

65
00:07:10,838 --> 00:07:15,173
or, to be quite honest, even
ask you, but as we know,

66
00:07:15,175 --> 00:07:19,410

the formalities, you know.

00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,050

you did on the beach,

00:07:25,052 --> 00:07:28,353
and it make me glad to hear
that I have a man

to kick these guys in the nuts

00:08:05,826 --> 00:08:08,059

to send you back home.

Not yet, not without her.

00:08:18,437 --> 00:08:21,372
She's Dr. India Eris,
a British scientist.

86
00:08:21,374 --> 00:08:23,975
She was doing research
in Belgium when the Nazis

87

took her hostage
two months ago.

88
00:08:25,978 --> 00:08:28,379
- What type of research?
- Unknown.

89
00:08:28,381 --> 00:08:30,048
She was working with the

That was her lab
in Belgium.

102
00:08:55,843 --> 00:08:58,475
Now apparently, she was able
to burn down all her research

103
00:08:58,477 --> 00:08:59,945
before the Nazis took her.

104
00:08:59,947 --> 00:09:01,879

the next best thing.

her at a refugee camp

in Romania on a scout.

111
00:09:16,863 --> 00:09:19,230
Now apparently she was
under great duress,

112
00:09:19,232 --> 00:09:23,701
and it appears that she's
working now for the Nazi regime.

113
00:09:23,703 --> 00:09:26,169

that nobody can make you do

anything you
don't want to do.

00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:32,543
Well, if that was the case,
why, half of the men in my unit

117
00:09:32,545 --> 00:09:34,144
wouldn't be doing
what I tell them to do

118
00:09:34,146 --> 00:09:35,346

now, would they?

119
00:09:35,348 --> 00:09:37,117
What's this got to do with me?

120
00:09:39,852 --> 00:09:42,888
Miss Eris is
an invaluable asset.

121
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:45,691

on the Allied side.

122
00:09:45,693 --> 00:09:48,058
Yeah, but she's British,
why don't they go find her?

123
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,496
They tried twice.

124
00:09:52,498 --> 00:09:56,201

125
00:09:56,203 --> 00:09:57,436
And?

126
00:09:57,438 --> 00:09:59,638

units went missing.

00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,206
They went missing.

128

happening in Romania,

00:10:05,178 --> 00:10:07,177
but we can't put
enough boots on the ground

130

to send in
a full unit of men.

131
00:10:09,183 --> 00:10:12,182

I'm not Special Forces.

133

Okay, look, intelligence says
there's a base near there

134
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,155
where the Nazis
are operating from.

135
00:10:18,157 --> 00:10:20,490
My guess, it's within
a five-mile perimeter

136
00:10:20,492 --> 00:10:22,027
of the village.

137
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:24,296
Now just start to scout there.

138
00:10:24,298 --> 00:10:26,130
But I want you to be aware,

139
00:10:26,132 --> 00:10:28,634
these locals are hostile
to Americans.

140
00:10:28,636 --> 00:10:32,870
Sir, with all due respect,

141
00:10:32,872 --> 00:10:37,042
I'm not the right
man for the job.

142
00:10:37,044 --> 00:10:42,113
With all due respect,
yes, you are.

143
00:10:42,115 --> 00:10:44,316
Look, all of our other
resources are in Germany,

144
00:10:44,318 --> 00:10:46,116
China and Japan.

145
00:10:46,118 --> 00:10:48,385
I think the Nazis
know that, okay.

146
00:10:48,387 --> 00:10:50,889
They don't think we're paying
any attention to Romania,

147
00:10:50,891 --> 00:10:55,092
and that's why we're going to
go and take advantage of that.

148
00:10:55,094 --> 00:10:57,361
Sir, since you assigned
me this operation,

149
00:10:57,363 --> 00:10:59,730
I'm assuming you assigned
me my squad, as well?

150
00:10:59,732 --> 00:11:01,865
It's no one you wouldn't
have selected yourself.

151
00:11:01,867 --> 00:11:05,703
You got Lieutenant Haas,
uh, plus Grey,

152
00:11:05,705 --> 00:11:08,907
Thompson, Brisco and any
other jokers you might want.

153
00:11:08,909 --> 00:11:11,142
Including those guys
that went AWOL.

154
00:11:11,144 --> 00:11:13,144
Hey, look, the mission
will give them a chance

155
00:11:13,146 --> 00:11:14,645
to win their spines back

156
00:11:14,647 --> 00:11:18,015
because I don't send
cowards home, all right?

157
00:11:18,017 --> 00:11:21,452
You bring that
doctor back to me,

158
00:11:21,454 --> 00:11:27,227
I will be sure that the
president himself thanks you.

159
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,570
You can shake
my hand now, Sir.

160
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,871
I'm in.

161
00:11:40,873 --> 00:11:43,376
Thank you.

162
00:12:01,495 --> 00:12:04,162
Coffee, Captain?

163
00:12:04,164 --> 00:12:06,496
Where'd you get
the fresh coffee?

164
00:12:06,498 --> 00:12:07,934
I didn't.

165
00:12:11,703 --> 00:12:14,938
So how close are we?

166
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,477
Should be coming up on the
village in a few more paces.

167
00:12:20,213 --> 00:12:22,348
There's something
blocking the road ahead.

168
00:12:27,319 --> 00:12:30,120
Looks like some
fallen branches.

169
00:12:30,122 --> 00:12:31,992
Let's go.

170
00:12:42,702 --> 00:12:45,937
So, uh, this broad's
just gonna be waiting for us

171
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:47,504
with open arms
to come save her?

172
00:12:47,506 --> 00:12:50,008
This isn't a Flash Gordon
serial, Grey.

173
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,710
Eh, screw that.

174
00:12:51,712 --> 00:12:53,677
They're gonna be making movies
about me when I get home.

175
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:56,014
Is that so?

176
00:12:56,016 --> 00:12:59,183
So-di-so-so, Mr. Thompson.

177
00:12:59,185 --> 00:13:03,921
Grey, who's gonna play you,
Ginger Rogers?

What do we do if

They won't, especially
when they see our cargo.

542
00:44:16,595 --> 00:44:18,928
It should buy us enough time
to infiltrate their base

if they can't even
defend themselves?

There must be some other
defense system in place.

brought the good doctor here.
