Enough already, you guys. Okay?
I'’m fine. I just had a bad rush.

330
00:15:06,975 --> 00:15:08,908
You could'’ve stayed
if you wanted to.

331
00:15:08,977 --> 00:15:10,219
'’I just don'’t you.'’

332
00:15:10,288 --> 00:15:12,566
You'’re a beautiful, educated,
successful woman

333
00:15:12,635 --> 00:15:14,568
'’who is like obsessed
with boys.'’

334
00:15:14,637 --> 00:15:16,122
What'’s there to get Jazz?

335
00:15:16,191 --> 00:15:18,883
When it comes to peach fest,
girlfriend just looses it.

336
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:21,851
- Sure.
- Oh, please.

337
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:25,648
[Michelle]
Like I'’m gonna advice
from you on relationships, Lena.

338
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:29,480
At least I don'’t get dogged
or dumped every week in my life.

339
00:15:29,549 --> 00:15:31,827
First of all, Michelle.
Nobody dogs me.

340
00:15:31,896 --> 00:15:35,175
And if I get dumped, it'’s '’cause
of the cards on the table.

341
00:15:35,244 --> 00:15:38,420
If they can'’t deal with my
honesty then fuck '’em very much.

342
00:15:38,489 --> 00:15:41,492
Lena, the minute you let a guy
know that you like him

343
00:15:41,561 --> 00:15:45,047
or that you'’re just happy to
see him, you gonna get dogged.

344
00:15:45,116 --> 00:15:48,533
And that card on the table crap
doesn'’t work in today'’s society.

345
00:15:48,602 --> 00:15:52,468
Oh, bullshit.
Works with the right person.

346
00:15:52,537 --> 00:15:55,920
My parents had the perfect
marriage, let me tell ya.

347
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:57,749
If my daddy
was alive today

348
00:15:57,818 --> 00:16:00,960
my parents would still be
married...in today'’s society.

349
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:05,033
Well, what worked back then
just does not now.

350
00:16:07,035 --> 00:16:11,142
[Lena]
'’That'’s because guys and girls
just don'’t communicate anymore.'’

351
00:16:11,211 --> 00:16:13,041
'’We gotta get rid of all this'’

352
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,560
'’segregated
Venus-Mars bullshit.'’

353
00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:17,355
- '’Just come together as one.'’
- Agreed.

354
00:16:17,424 --> 00:16:21,325
'’Move as one
and think as one and..'’

355
00:16:21,394 --> 00:16:23,223
'’That'’s what
it'’s all about.'’

356
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:26,709
'’You know, it'’s about bonding.
Of being together.'’

357
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:29,367
[Michelle]
You mean, bondage?
Oh, God. Come on.

358
00:16:29,436 --> 00:16:32,129
Why'’d you think Jazz broke off
her engagement with Michael?

359
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:34,441
That'’s '’cause she was losing
her individuality.

360
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:37,065
That'’s not exactly
true, Michelle.

361
00:16:37,134 --> 00:16:38,549
[Lena]
'’Well, something is off.'’

362
00:16:38,618 --> 00:16:40,551
[Michelle]
My point is...Lena.

363
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,277
[Lena]
'’Bad feng shui.'’

364
00:16:42,346 --> 00:16:45,625
Hey-hey, Lena. What you doing?
What you doing? Stop it.

365
00:16:45,694 --> 00:16:47,799
The energy is still
off in here.

366
00:16:47,868 --> 00:16:50,768
[Jasmine]
Please. Energy is always off
when you'’re confused or high.

367
00:16:50,837 --> 00:16:52,459
[Michelle]
My point is..

368
00:16:52,528 --> 00:16:56,429
Lena, you live in a fantasy
world that does not exist.

369
00:16:56,498 --> 00:17:01,227
[Jasmine]
'’No offence, Michelle. But your
reality isn'’t exactly normal.'’

370
00:17:01,296 --> 00:17:02,504
- '’Yeah.'’
- No, it'’s not.

371
00:17:02,573 --> 00:17:04,609
Just having sex
with two guys at once.

372
00:17:04,678 --> 00:17:06,818
[Michelle]
'’Feeds into their
competitive nature.'’

373
00:17:06,887 --> 00:17:08,958
- Oh, please.
- Keeps them on their toes.

374
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:14,171
Doubles my chances of being well
served and pleasantly pleased.

375
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,484
'’Actually, you should
look into it sometime.'’

376
00:17:17,553 --> 00:17:20,280
No, thanks. I'’m not into
waking up with a crowd.

377
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:22,524
[Michelle]
Yeah, well.
Neither am I.

378
00:17:22,593 --> 00:17:27,805
Eternity is from...
the moment I come

379
00:17:27,874 --> 00:17:31,360
until the moment I hear
that front door close.

380
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,813
[Michelle]
Goodnight, ladies.

381
00:17:35,882 --> 00:17:37,987
[doorbell rings]

382
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,713
Who'’s that?

383
00:17:44,546 --> 00:17:45,547
Who is that?

384
00:17:45,616 --> 00:17:47,376
'’It'’s me, Scott.'’

385
00:17:47,445 --> 00:17:48,653
Scott?

386
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:50,828
[Lena]
Oh!

387
00:17:53,175 --> 00:17:55,177
[both]
Booty call.

388
00:17:57,352 --> 00:18:00,320
Don'’t you dare?
Don'’t you dare.

389
00:18:00,389 --> 00:18:02,253
I'’m serious.

390
00:18:13,368 --> 00:18:15,335
Hello, beautiful.

391
00:18:15,404 --> 00:18:16,716
What'’s up?

392
00:18:16,785 --> 00:18:19,201
What'’s up?

393
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,616
She'’s mad at me?

394
00:18:20,685 --> 00:18:23,792
Scott, it'’s 4'’o clock
in the morning. You know?

395
00:18:23,861 --> 00:18:28,279
You stop by without calling
and...you haven'’t returned calls

396
00:18:28,348 --> 00:18:31,455
since the last time
you came without calling.

397
00:18:32,663 --> 00:18:36,080
I guess you could say
I'’m a little pissed.

398
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:39,946
I just came by to apologize
for being such an asshole.

399
00:18:40,015 --> 00:18:41,913
Thanks.

400
00:18:41,982 --> 00:18:43,743
You going to invite me in?

401
00:18:43,812 --> 00:18:46,297
No. I gotta get up
in a few hours.

402
00:18:46,366 --> 00:18:48,403
So, go to sleep.

403
00:18:48,472 --> 00:18:52,131
We can talk about it tomorrow
over breakfast.

404
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,961
You know I'’m going to
be serving it to you.

405
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,515
In bed.
I'’ll even feed you.

406
00:18:59,379 --> 00:19:01,864
Come on. I'’ve been going through
lotta shit lately.

407
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:04,626
My band just broke up.

408
00:19:04,695 --> 00:19:06,835
- Your band broke up?
- Yeah.

409
00:19:06,904 --> 00:19:08,906
It'’s been a real drag.

410
00:19:08,975 --> 00:19:10,528
I'’m sorry.

411
00:19:10,597 --> 00:19:13,600
I just really need someone
to talk to right now.

412
00:19:20,469 --> 00:19:22,368
Okay, but just talk.

413
00:19:27,235 --> 00:19:29,168
I'’m serious.

414
00:19:35,035 --> 00:19:36,830
[moaning]

415
00:19:38,867 --> 00:19:40,800
[moaning continues]

416
00:19:47,427 --> 00:19:49,326
[music]

417
00:20:01,303 --> 00:20:03,236
So much for talking.

418
00:20:05,134 --> 00:20:07,275
'’Nothing like a good doobie.'’

419
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,350
You want some?

420
00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:16,353
No, I-I really should
let you get some sleep.

421
00:20:16,422 --> 00:20:20,115
What, are you kidding?
I'’m wide awake. Oh, I feel good.

422
00:20:22,151 --> 00:20:24,706
'’Let me cook you breakfast.'’

423
00:20:24,775 --> 00:20:26,811
I'’ll even feed you.

424
00:20:29,676 --> 00:20:31,609
I really..

425
00:20:32,886 --> 00:20:34,819
I gotta go.

426
00:20:38,961 --> 00:20:42,379
Oh...okay.

427
00:20:46,106 --> 00:20:48,039
- Scott.
- Yeah?

428
00:20:50,007 --> 00:20:53,252
I really...really like you.

429
00:20:57,773 --> 00:21:02,019
Maybe we can...go out on
a real date sometime, you know.

430
00:21:02,088 --> 00:21:04,470
I mean, don'’t get me wrong.

431
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:07,369
Sex is awesome
and everything but..

432
00:21:12,443 --> 00:21:14,652
I'’d like to think that
we'’re capable of connecting

433
00:21:14,721 --> 00:21:17,759
on...another level, you know.

434
00:21:30,012 --> 00:21:32,429
So what are you doing
tomorrow night?

435
00:21:33,844 --> 00:21:36,295
Ha ha.

436
00:21:36,364 --> 00:21:38,538
I don'’t know.

437
00:21:38,607 --> 00:21:40,885
Why don'’t you tell me?

438
00:21:40,954 --> 00:21:44,441
[Michelle]
'’Oh, please. I cannot believe
you'’ve never faked an orgasm.'’

439
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:47,823
[Jasmine]
'’How do you fake an orgasm?'’

440
00:21:47,892 --> 00:21:49,411
'’No, who are you fooling?'’

441
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,724
[Michelle]
'’Him. And who cares anyway?'’

442
00:21:51,793 --> 00:21:55,210
Sometimes it'’s the only way to
free yourself from a bad fuck.

443
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:58,662
[Lena]
'’Yeah. It'’s the politically
correct thing to do.'’

444
00:21:58,731 --> 00:22:01,009
Thank God, Scott
takes good care of me.

445
00:22:01,078 --> 00:22:03,529
P.C. fucking. No way, honey.

446
00:22:03,598 --> 00:22:05,841
When my show gets on air,
it'’ll be about

447
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:08,361
real issues females
face when it comes to

448
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,259
dating and mating in the '’90s.

449
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,849
[Lena]
Uh, hello. Uh, what do you think
faking orgasms is, girl, huh?

450
00:22:13,918 --> 00:22:15,920
It'’s a serious issue
for females.

451
00:22:15,989 --> 00:22:17,819
Bullshit. Look, if the kiss
ain'’t right

452
00:22:17,888 --> 00:22:19,441
you just keep your legs tight.

453
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,788
- You gotta know before you go.
- '’Uh-huh?'’

454
00:22:21,857 --> 00:22:24,619
[beatboxing]

455
00:22:24,688 --> 00:22:27,449
No, you guys, I'’m serious.
Wa-what do you think that

456
00:22:27,518 --> 00:22:30,556
the guy gets better the further
down your body he travels?

457
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:32,558
- Hello.
- Sometimes.

458
00:22:32,627 --> 00:22:35,837
- Like I wanna wait.
- Ha, ha, ha.

459
00:22:35,906 --> 00:22:39,185
By the way, Lena, could you have
been any louder last night?

460
00:22:39,254 --> 00:22:41,187
- I thought you were dying.
- Oh, my God.

461
00:22:41,256 --> 00:22:43,741
Yeah. Well, I did.
Four times, guys.

462
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:45,916
You came four times last night.

463
00:22:45,985 --> 00:22:49,264
Uh-Huh. Yup.

464
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:50,955
- For real?
- '’Yeah.'’

465
00:22:51,024 --> 00:22:53,717
Oh, my God.
I love when that happens.

466
00:22:53,786 --> 00:22:55,304
Thank you.

467
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,859
Well, I can'’t believe
you even went there with him.

468
00:22:57,928 --> 00:22:59,447
He'’s using you for sex.

469
00:22:59,516 --> 00:23:02,484
Really? Is that why he'’s taking
me out to dinner tonight?

470
00:23:02,553 --> 00:23:04,348
Oh, he'’ll take you
to dinner, honey.

471
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:06,488
But you'’re still
gonna be the dessert.

472
00:23:06,557 --> 00:23:08,559
Wait-wait-wait a minute.

473
00:23:08,628 --> 00:23:10,389
I thought you'’re
interviewing girls with me

474
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:12,460
on the street
today after lunch.

475
00:23:12,529 --> 00:23:16,084
I am, honey. He'’s taking me
out to dinner.

476
00:23:16,153 --> 00:23:19,156
I tell you, he'’s using you for
sex. You'’re wasting your time.

477
00:23:19,225 --> 00:23:21,952
What makes you think
she'’s not using him for sex?

478
00:23:22,021 --> 00:23:24,126
Oh, Michelle,
because she'’s not you.

479
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:26,577
Guys, can we talk
about me behind my back?

480
00:23:26,646 --> 00:23:32,652
- Sure. Turn around. Ha, ha.
- Oh-ho, ha, ha, ha.

481
00:23:32,721 --> 00:23:37,968
- Ha, ha, ha. Oh, God.
- Ha, ha, ha.

482
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:45,941
Well, Lena wet the bed
until she was ten years old.

483
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,117
Mom, can we please talk about
something else? Thank you.

484
00:23:49,186 --> 00:23:52,914
[female #3]
'’Jasmine was bed ridden until
she was around'’ nine years old.

485
00:23:52,983 --> 00:23:55,054
She practically lived
in the hospital.

486
00:23:55,123 --> 00:23:58,644
One illness after the other. She
was so accustomed to being sick.

487
00:23:58,713 --> 00:24:00,784
'’When she first started
growing breasts'’

488
00:24:00,853 --> 00:24:04,995
she thought those cute little
lumps...were cancerous tumors.

489
00:24:05,064 --> 00:24:08,723
- '’Ha, ha, ha.'’
- '’Ha, ha, ha.'’

490
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:12,381
Thank you
for sharing that, mom.

491
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,211
Maybe we should open
the presents.

492
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,490
Nonsense. What'’s the rush?

493
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:21,287
[female #3]

how they were?

after sex and this is dirty

I can'’t believe
I'’ve been stood up again.

715
00:35:50,113 --> 00:35:52,357
I was stood up
at a bar one time

716
00:35:52,426 --> 00:35:54,531
which was really embarrassing.
It'’s kind of humiliating.

717
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,293
If they don'’t want you,
they should tell you

718
00:35:57,362 --> 00:35:58,846
straight up and stick with it.

719
00:35:58,915 --> 00:36:02,505

I guess you feel like

you know, "Oh God, what-what
did I do?" Like, you think.

721
00:36:06,681 --> 00:36:09,374
I think I give him
too much attention.

722
00:36:09,443 --> 00:36:11,030
Maybe, that could'’ve been it.

723
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:15,587
Um, maybe, I-I know
I didn'’t neglect him.

724
00:36:15,656 --> 00:36:18,762
So, I sit on my couch
and stare out my window.

725
00:36:18,831 --> 00:36:21,109
He never, he never told me why.

726
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,284
I had to be the one to call.

727
00:36:23,353 --> 00:36:27,461
That'’s a good indication that
it'’s probably not the person

728

any time with.

729
00:36:29,256 --> 00:36:31,016

his name is or who he is.

733
00:36:39,645 --> 00:36:43,546
I dealt with it the wrong way.
I blocked guys out and thought

"All guys are trash, creeps. All
guys are dogs." But they'’re not.

735
00:36:47,412 --> 00:36:49,759
I think it has to do
with self-esteem.

736
00:36:49,828 --> 00:36:52,244
You gotta have more
confidence in yourself.

737
00:36:52,313 --> 00:36:55,661
Um, '’cause confidence just,
is so attractive.

the reason why girls

give us confidence. Just think.

Well, come on.
You know what I mean.

746
00:37:19,651 --> 00:37:22,654
There are many girls who need
a guy to make them happy.

747
00:37:22,723 --> 00:37:27,348
It'’s like they'’re dying for a
man to validate their existence.

have that control over my life.

off the engagement with Michael?

01:01:01,727 --> 01:01:03,211
Thanks for dropping off
the tape.

1153
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,317
And can you ask the studio
if they can make a copy

1154
01:01:06,386 --> 01:01:09,113
'’cause I didn'’t get to run
any copies of this morning.

1155
01:01:09,182 --> 01:01:11,357
- Will do.
- Good luck.

1156
01:01:13,255 --> 01:01:14,947
Phew, so.

Some..

1159
01:01:19,848 --> 01:01:22,402
Remember, that girl I introduced
you to at Drew'’s party?

1160
01:01:22,471 --> 01:01:25,164
Ah, that night is a bit
of a blur for me.

1161
01:01:25,233 --> 01:01:27,028
[sighs]

1162
01:01:28,477 --> 01:01:32,827
Well, anyway her name
is Chloe, and..

1163
01:01:32,896 --> 01:01:34,725
[sighs]

1164
01:01:34,794 --> 01:01:38,039
The other night
when Drew was at class we..

1165
01:01:41,283 --> 01:01:46,392
We smoked a joint
and decided to..

1166
01:01:46,461 --> 01:01:50,361
Well, make a home movie
and-and--

1167
01:01:50,430 --> 01:01:52,363
- Drew found the tape?
- Oh, shit.

1168
01:01:52,432 --> 01:01:53,813

'’Open the damn door, now.'’

01:01:55,884 --> 01:01:59,163
- Oh, God.
- Okay. No, I got it.

[knocking continues]

1172
01:02:02,166 --> 01:02:04,065
- Oh, no.
- Chloe, please wait.

1173
01:02:04,134 --> 01:02:05,756
No. Where is she?

1174
01:02:11,072 --> 01:02:13,833
I hop in the shower
and you decide to take off?

1175
01:02:13,902 --> 01:02:16,940
- I'’m tired of arguing with you.
- Then just say that.

1176
01:02:17,009 --> 01:02:18,804
Don'’t just fucking walk out.

1177
01:02:18,873 --> 01:02:21,772
If you really gonna leave then,
take your shit with you.

1178
01:02:21,841 --> 01:02:23,049
Fuck you!

1179
01:02:24,326 --> 01:02:26,363
- Meg, stop it.
- Come on.

1180
01:02:26,432 --> 01:02:28,054
Stop it.
You'’re hurting her.

1181
01:02:28,123 --> 01:02:30,436
- Stop it. Beg you.
- You selfish whore.

1182
01:02:30,505 --> 01:02:33,370
Oh, I'’m the whore?
What the fuck are you?

1183
01:02:33,439 --> 01:02:35,372
I mean, every time
I turn around

1184
01:02:35,441 --> 01:02:38,306
you'’re flirting with this girl
and that guy. Fuck you!

1185
01:02:38,375 --> 01:02:40,618
One minute you'’re gay
the next minute you'’re straight

1186
01:02:40,687 --> 01:02:43,414
then yourself, I'’m damn tired
of trying to figure you out.

1187
01:02:43,483 --> 01:02:46,728
Like you'’ve ever tried to
figure me out. You don'’t care.

1188
01:02:46,797 --> 01:02:48,557
All you care is
keeping me around

1189
01:02:48,626 --> 01:02:51,112
like some kinda trophy
to show off to your friends.

1190
01:02:51,181 --> 01:02:54,391
Oh, yeah, well, you'’re some
fucking expensive trophy.

1191
01:02:56,289 --> 01:02:59,361
I'’ve never asked you
for anything.

1192
01:03:00,846 --> 01:03:03,158
You'’re so tied up in being
the heartbreaker

1193

club owner of miss
nothing can hurt me.

1194
01:03:06,127 --> 01:03:09,993
You know I'’m only human.
I hurt, I feel, I have needs.

1195
01:03:13,893 --> 01:03:17,000
Drew, I always tell everyone
how great you are

1196
01:03:17,069 --> 01:03:18,691
and how much I love you.

1197
01:03:19,865 --> 01:03:22,177
Yeah, you ever think
about telling me?

1198
01:03:24,248 --> 01:03:26,250
Some things you
should just know.

1199
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:28,149
Why should I have
to tell you?

1200
01:03:29,771 --> 01:03:31,669
Why?

1201
01:03:37,744 --> 01:03:42,473
Because I love you so much
and I need to hear

1202
01:03:42,542 --> 01:03:44,924
and feel that
I'’m not left alone.

1203
01:03:46,477 --> 01:03:48,341
That'’s why.

[vehicle honking]

1206
01:04:09,293 --> 01:04:11,261
- Good morning, may I help you?
- Hi, yeah.

1207
01:04:11,330 --> 01:04:14,022
I'’m here to drop off
a demo talk show presentation.

1208
01:04:14,091 --> 01:04:16,335
- Hm, for whom?
- That'’s a very good question.

1209
01:04:16,404 --> 01:04:19,545
I'’m dropping it off for a friend
she didn'’t tell me who.

1210
01:04:19,614 --> 01:04:23,204
Eh, excuse me?
Do I know you from somewhere?

1211
01:04:24,446 --> 01:04:26,517
Hi, weren'’t you
the bartender--

1212
01:04:26,586 --> 01:04:28,519
At Drew'’s party, yeah.

1213
01:04:28,588 --> 01:04:31,488
Yeah. Ha ha.
Oh, hi.

1214
01:04:31,557 --> 01:04:33,939
Listen, I'’m really sorry
if I was rude.

1215
01:04:34,008 --> 01:04:37,218
No, not at all, it, uh,
it was good for me.

1216
01:04:38,944 --> 01:04:40,462
So what you here for?

1217
01:04:40,531 --> 01:04:44,052
I'’m dropping off a presentation
but I dunno who to give it to.

1218
01:04:44,121 --> 01:04:45,433
You'’re looking at him.

1219
01:04:45,502 --> 01:04:47,504
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

1220
01:04:47,573 --> 01:04:50,645
Small world. Are you one
of the producers?

1221
01:04:50,714 --> 01:04:52,681
Oh, no. I work
in the editing room.

1222
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:55,512
Putting reels together and
making copies. Things like that.

1223
01:04:55,581 --> 01:04:58,584
That'’s funny, my next question
was can I get a copy made.

1224
01:04:58,653 --> 01:05:00,931
My friend didn'’t have
to do it for herself.

1225
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,382
- Sure. Come with me.
- Okay.

1226
01:05:08,387 --> 01:05:10,044
Have a seat.

1227
01:05:12,494 --> 01:05:17,327

Great name for a show.

1229

Yeah.

1230
01:05:23,402 --> 01:05:26,888
- So you work two jobs?
- For the time being.

1231
01:05:26,957 --> 01:05:29,028
I'’m in the process
of defending my dissertation

1232
01:05:29,097 --> 01:05:31,134
on sexual niblets.

You'’re a shrink?

1234

Nah, I prefer research
over clinical practice.

1235

you get a hold of the right one?

labeled the wrong tape.

the tape of you and Chloe

- Lena!
- What?

01:06:44,862 --> 01:06:47,693
God, I got your message,
there was only one tape

1255
01:06:47,762 --> 01:06:50,178
on the coffee table.
What is it?

1256
01:06:51,697 --> 01:06:54,596
What? Michelle, what happened?

by accident.

And..

01:07:13,374 --> 01:07:16,204
- Shit, they..
- What?

1262
01:07:20,312 --> 01:07:23,522
They burnt Jazz'’s tape.

1263
01:07:24,247 --> 01:07:26,042
Oh, my God.

that was her only copy.

a bitch on wheels

1268
01:07:47,028 --> 01:07:49,617
What'’s going on, you guys?

01:07:51,343 --> 01:07:52,447

1270
01:07:54,691 --> 01:07:56,693
Did you take the tape
to the station?

1271

What do you mean, no?

1272
01:08:01,249 --> 01:08:07,186
Jazz...Drew and Morgan
took your tape

1273
01:08:07,255 --> 01:08:09,395
instead of theirs
when they left this morning.

1274
01:08:09,464 --> 01:08:12,467
Did you get it back?

1275
01:08:12,536 --> 01:08:14,228
I tried.

1276
01:08:15,470 --> 01:08:17,369
What'’s that supposed to mean?

1277
01:08:19,785 --> 01:08:23,133
They burnt it.
Before I could get it back.

No, no, it'’s not
the mother in me.

- Yeah, it is.
- No.
