1
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,511
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

2
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,233
Let go! Let go! Stop!

3
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,716
Damn. Richard Ellespeare died.

4
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,679
- He was a professor of mine at Harvard.
- No!

5
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,911
- He was a novelist, humanitarian.
- Hey, hey, back there.

6
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,197
- Published eight novels, including the best seller...
- Stop it! Quit it!

7
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,430
Hope's Way, for which
he won the Pulitzer Prize.

8
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,554
- What kind of man was this?
- A man who pursues excellence and nothing less.

9
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,312
- Dad?
- Yes?

10
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,755
I have to go to the bathroom.

11
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,078
Can't you hold it
till we get there?

12
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,038
Mmm, yes. I guess...

13
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,310
I can practice
mind over matter.

14
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,432
Atta girl.

15
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,479
Oh, look at
the baby cows, Ellie!

16
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,189
Oh, my God!
Look at them.

17
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,272
I'm reading, Mom.
And baby cows are calves.

18
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,238
I was never close
to my mother growing up.

19
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,476
Is that something Mr. Best
is going to use against me?

20
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,468
Ellen, the D.A.'s not going
to use anything against you.

21
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,791
Okay. Because...
Well, I-I agreed to do this because...

22
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,877
Mrs. Best, his wife,
was a friend of my mother's.

23
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,311
Do I need an attorney?

24
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,119
Nobody in this office
is accusing you of anything.

25
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,077
We're well aware that
this kind of thing happens...

26
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,237
all the time
with terminal patients.

27
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,840
It's... It's a small town.
People talk.

28
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,155
The D.A. Wants to be able to say
that he looked into it...

29
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,959
and he can put it to bed.

30
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,918
What can I say?
It's an election year.

31
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,037
Anyway, were you aware that an autopsy
was being performed on your mother's body?

32
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,352
Yes, uh-huh, at her request.

33
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,876
Uh, actually to find out
the source of the disease.

34
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,115
Primarily for my benefit.

35
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,789
Mm-hmm.
Where are you living now?

36
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,277
In New York. I've been there
since I finished Harvard.

37
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,071
This living in the suburbs
is going to kill me.

38
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,197
Hey, Tweedy, the Bearstone Ladies
predict a stock market crash next month.

39
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,879
- Finish the captions on the junk shot, Casey.
- They're antiques.

40
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,837
- I've got a 110 pulse. I've got to check this again.
- Tweedy.

41
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,996
This story is too good.

42
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,038
Senator Sullivan, youngest guy
ever to be elected to the Senate.

43
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,953
His father was a drug dealer,
he overcomes that... excuse me...

44
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,600
is on his way to big things,
possibly the presidency...

45
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,275
- until he crashes his car into a tree, kills everyone inside...
- That was actually final draft?

46
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,191
While he's on cocaine.

47
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,111
I mean, this is not just good.
This is great.

48
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,714
Shakespearean. Sins of the father
revisited on the son...

49
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,631
- etcetera, etcetera.
- We've got no interview. He's not talking.

50
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,551
- I can get him to talk. I promise you.
- He's checking into rehab.

51
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,551
Some people in town
are describing you as...

52
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,160
cold and insensitive.

53
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,913
Um...

54
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,434
Ambition is Ellen Gulden's religion.

55
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,911
- She's condescending. She's remote, whatever.
- I can get him to talk.

56
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,958
Well, I was ambitious.

57
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,230
I still am.

58
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,949
My father taught me to work very hard
at everything I do, and I always have.

59
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,113
I'm not tired.

60
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,193
- So you were living a pretty
normal life in New York? - Uh-huh.

61
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,111
- Apartment?
- Uh-huh.

62
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,158
- Roommate?
- No. No roommate.

63
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,071
- Boyfriend?
- Boyfriend.

64
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,549
- Honey, please let me explain.
- Jordan, just get out of here.

65
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,471
- I don't want to see you anymore.
- Come on. I got...

66
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,391
I'm standing out here. I got wine,
candles. I got the whole kit.

67
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,710
Just go away, Jordan.

68
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,870
EI, can I just talk to you for five
minutes, please? I'll explain everything.

69
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,797
- Go away!
- We were together...

70
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,717
since senior year in college.

71
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,194
This one was the last time, okay?

72
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,716
Well, not together.
We, uh... We took breaks.

73
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,756
You know, a lot of breaks.

74
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,709
That's mean. That's not funny.

75
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,951
- He just needed some space.
- Space named Linda.

76
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,315
I'm sorry. Was that her name?
Lori? I don't remember.

77
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,396
- Oh, you're so mean.
- Is that not her name?

78
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,278
- That... You're so mean.
- Don't get me wrong.

79
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,675
I like him.

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,549
Of course, it was, um,
Jules, my best girlfriend...

81
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,952
who, uh, came home with me
to celebrate my father's birthday.

82
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,237
Jordan, um, as usual,
had something he had to do.

83
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,028
Oh, this ought to be good.

84
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,997
"Come as your favorite literary
character." I don't know why...

85
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,998
my mom can't just throw
a normal birthday party.

86
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,071
Ellie, it's going to be perfectly fine.

87
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,833
Thank you. Thanks.

88
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,519
- Hey!
- Whoo-hoo!

89
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,352
- Hi.
- Hi.

90
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,079
- Oh, good hat. Uh-huh. - Really
good hat. Really good everything.

91
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,997
Thanks. What'd you guys
come dressed as?

92
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,071
The Sylvia Plath twins?

93
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,236
- Brian, you know I can't do costumes.
- Why?

94
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,834
- It's just so... Mom.
- Human?

95
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,155
- So what have you guys been up to?
- God!

96
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,196
- Ooh. Mm-hmm.
- It's writing and deadlines.

97
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,117
Take me away.

98
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,037
- Okay.
- Oh, wait!

99
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,753
Somebody just finished summer school,
didn't he? Congratulations!

100
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,360
- Actually, I didn't finish.
- That's great!

101
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,908
What?

102
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,468
I, Brian Gulden...

103
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,076
son of Mr. American Literature and the
romantics, failed American Literature.

104
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,831
You're serious?

105
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,913
- Yeah.
- Well, way to go.

106
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,959
- How did you do that?
- I blew the test, Ellen.

107
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,111
Brian.

108
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,750
Did you tell Dad?

109
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,791
No.

110
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,509
Just 'cause I'm failing
doesn't make me a moron.

111
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,471
Yoo-hoo! Hi!

112
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,437
- There she is.
- Hi, Mom.

113
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,636
Your dad's not here.
The coast is clear. Gimme! Gimme!

114
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,870
Gimme!
Hi, Jules.

115
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,315
Hi.

116
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,709
- Hi. You too.
- Good to see you.

117
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,631
- Let me get your...
- Oh, no, no, no. I got it.

118
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,676
- Are you sure? Okay.
- Yeah, yeah. Thanks. Oh, thank you.

119
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,678
- Wow.
- Thank you.

120
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,036
You got a cab? I would have sent
Brian to come and pick you up.

121
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,991
- You should have told me.
- Oh, that's okay.

122
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,911
Come in. Come in,
come in, come in.

123
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,117
- God, this must have taken you days.
- Oh, well, yes.

124
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,031
- Jules, you look wonderful.
- Oh, thanks.

125
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,032
- I just cut my hair.
- Oh. It looks gorgeous.

126
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,680
- And your hair looks great too.
- Oh, thank you.

127
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,877
Oh, this... It's yarn.
Look. Guess who I am.

128
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,791
Hmm? Oh!

129
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,555
Oh, wait! Clue.

130
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,910
- Oh... If I only had a brain
- A heart

131
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,309
A brain
and whatever else

132
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,994
Oh, well.
You're right, as usual.

133
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:45,636
- So, let me see. Who are you?
- Uh...

134
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,276
- Don't tell me. Let me guess. - Actually,
you know what? We-We kind of forgot.

135
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,550
But is was only because
we were trying to hurry...

136
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,513
'cause, of course, we wanted
to be here on time, so...

137
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,790
- God, that cake looks so good. So, we're just us.
- Oh.

138
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,230
That's okay.
That's okay, Ellie. That's...

139
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,390
Ooh!
But I have an idea.

140
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,597
I do have a Thanksgiving
costume upstairs.

141
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,830
- That's okay.
- I could whip something up for you. It's a turkey!

142
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,070
- No, really. It's okay. It's all right.
- It's really...

143
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,276
- Can I help you with anything?
- Oh, yes, thanks.

144
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,359
- You could take those dishes, put them in the buffet. Umm...
- Sure.

145
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,193
And Ellie... Ellie?

146
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,677
You can... keep-keep, uh,
slicing the bread...

147
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,593
- with this knife, okay?
- Thank you.

148
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,956
I read your piece
on Geraldine Ferraro.

149
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,871
My brilliant daughter.

150
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,758
I was so... proud of you.

151
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,559
It's no big deal.
It's just a little follow-up piece.

152
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,955
Back and forth.
Saw on it.

153
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,391
- Do you think that Dad read it?
- Oh, I'm sure he did.

154
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,519
You know your dad.
But he doesn't talk shop with me.

155
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,189
Fuck.

156
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,549
Nope. It's okay. It's okay.
It's not even bleeding.

157
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,511
- It's fine. It's really fine.
- Wrap it up.

158
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,114
- Okay. Thank you.
- Brown paper. There's something in it that stops the bleeding.

159
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,317
- Did you know that? -
Really? - Okay, thanks.

160
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,472
- Oh! Oh, dear.
- Sorry.

161
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,080
- No, I'll get it.
- That's all right. Don't throw the pieces out...

162
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,549
- because I'm going to use it in my mosaic table I'm making.
- Don't worry.

163
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,831
- We got it.
- Keep your finger up and wrapped in the bag.

164
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,832
Hello?
There's no place like home.

165
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,195
- Thank God.
- Are we the first ones here?

166
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,632
- Ellen! Oh, it's good to see you.
- Oh, yeah.

167
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,551
- You're lookin' tired.
- Ellen.

168
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,679
- Now, who are you supposed to be? Who?
- Oh, I'm Lizzie Borden.

169
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,029
You know, Lizzie Borden:
"Took an axe...

170
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,277
gave her mother 40 whacks."

171
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,709
Oh, Mrs. Best, can you
hold the door? Oh, thanks.

172
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,519
- Help! Ellen, I just saw Dad. He just turned the corner.
- Oh! Hey!

173
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,596
Jules! Jules!
Come help. Come help.

174
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,200
Okay.

175
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,477
- So, um, Snow White, explain. What was that?
- Oh.

176
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,031
Mrs. Best, the D.A.'s wife,
she's in my mom's cult.

177
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,957
The Minnies, yeah.

178
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,877
They're named after
some local do-gooder...

179
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,912
who used to decorate Christmas trees
in the town square.

180
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,468
- And, um, they're a cult?
- Woman's group.

181
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,233
- Right. Right.
- You know, bake sales, tag sales, all of that.

182
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,151
- Come on. You be nice.
- Do-good stuff.

183
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,071
- No. Hi.
- You must be Ellen. I'm Harold Simpkey.

184
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,991
- I teach music over...
- Harold, could you, um...

185
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,753
He's here!
Hurry up! Hurry up!

186
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,956
Hurry up! Here he is.

187
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,871
Everybody, get-get-get down!

188
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:22,750
Shh! Ralph, move your... Shh!

189
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,151
Quiet!

190
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,156
Kate?

191
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,397
Kate?

192
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,711
- Kate?
- Surprise!

193
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,071
Happy birthday!

194
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,838
No. Look at all of you.

195
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,757
Kate.

196
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,076
How did you pull this off?
Bravo!

197
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,839
Come on, Dad, speech.

198
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,713
Speech! Speech!

199
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,393
I'm quite out of breath with walking
home. It's only in going uphill...

200
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,910
that you realize
you're headed downhill.

201
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,870
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you all for coming.

202
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,997
I'm really...
I'm really very touched.

203
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,429
I'm very touched.

204
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,432
So, I guess this is the...

205
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,119
last class of the semester.

206
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,077
Thank you for taking this journey
with me. It's been a lot of fun.

207
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,432
And have a great summer.

208
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,630
There it is.

209
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,075
The National Book Award.

210
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,230
Oh, wow. He knows Oliver Most.

211
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,510
Yeah, they went to Harvard together.

212
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,556
Come see this. Come here.

213
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,878
It's his novel, Comeback Inn.

214
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,315
He's been working on it for years.

215
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,396
Took Milton ten
to finish my favorite poem.

216
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,273
Oh, here's his collected essays.

217
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,231
I read this first chapter.

218
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,151
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

219
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,391
And?

220
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,869
- It's great.
- Uh-huh.

221
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,997
So, uh, what-what'd he say
about your article?

222
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,036
Oh, I don't believe it.

223
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,554
You didn't ask him, did you?

224
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,437
Ellie. Tsk.

225
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,354
- That's what they called me.
- Did they now?

226
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,271
You know,
having the dubious distinction...

227
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,750
of having been called "Big Al"
when you were this diminutive...

228
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,719
package is a challenge
to confidence...

229
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,115
but you have obviously
survived it, have you not?

230
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,709
- Yes.
- So here you have in front of you a living example...

231
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,872
of-of everything
you're trying to achieve.

232
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,633
I would just say get an ice breaker
and break out of it.

233
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,551
- I'm havin' a lot of trouble.
- Listen...

234
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,394
a writer calls his friend, he says,
"I've just finished writing a story.

235
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,789
"It's not very good.
In fact, it's terrible.

236
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,314
The worst part of it is
it's the best I can do."

237
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:55,753
The writer is John Steinbeck.
The book is Grapes of Wrath!

238
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,950
- Hi! Hi.
- Hey! Hi.

239
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,833
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

240
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,599
I'm afraid with 55
staring at me in the face...

241
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,835
I'm developing inflammation
of the sentence structure...

242
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,350
and a definite hardening
of the paragraphs, but...

243
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,989
- How are you?
- Oh, no. How are you?

244
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,429
You knew all about
this little thing, didn't you?

245
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,710
- Huh?
- No, actually, I didn't.

246
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,597
Hmm.

247
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,197
Well, did you get a chance
to look at my latest piece?

248
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,710
Yes. Yes, of course.

249
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,593
The Minnies seem to get
their literature from Disney.

250
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,200
I know.

251
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,117
- Hey!
- Oh, my God, they're everywhere.

252
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,790
Enemy forces at 2:00.
Danger, Will Robertson. Danger.

253
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,156
- It's Robinson. Robinson.
- Oh, Robinson.

254
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,312
Safe.

255
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,237
Safe for the moment.

256
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,509
That was better. That was better.
Now I'll show you...

257
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,431
About your article...

258
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,476
- Hmm.
- I don't want to interfere, you know.

259
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,239
- You are doing just fine.
- Oh, no. Come on.

260
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,272
Come on. You know your criticism,
it helps me so much.

261
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,197
I really appreciate it.

262
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,391
All right.

263
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,311
Writer to writer.

264
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,150
- Less is more.
- Hmm.

265
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,512
Your approach is a little
overemotional at times.

266
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,309
It needs to be more succinct. The word
choice needs to be more muscular.

267
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,193
Ellen, you've got a great talent,
but it's not enough.

268
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,111
You have to reach, goddamn it.

269
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,191
When I was 20 years old
working at the New Yorker...

270
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,595
I would spend a whole day
working on one sentence.

271
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,518
I mean, Lord knows I could...

272
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,268
Wait a minute.
It's your best work to date. It's...

273
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,310
It's not your fault. It's like
the problem is that editor, damn it.

274
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,472
- What is his name? Uh, Tw... Twimpy?
- Tweedy.

275
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,391
Yeah.

276
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,675
- George? Well, see ya.
- He's a fool as far as...

277
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,591
- Hey.
- Yeah? We're hiding.

278
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,389
I know. Come inside. It's time to
blow out the candles and make a wish!

279
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,994
Oh, I wish we were... alone.

280
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,436
Well, we're not yet. So hurry up.
Come on. Everybody's waiting.

281
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,991
Man, that's solid.

282
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,958
Brian, how's Harvard treating ya?

283
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,390
Can't complain.
We beat Oxford in the Prentice Cup.

284
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,837
I was referring
to your courses.

285
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,956
Summer school was all right?

286
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,429
Uh, fine.

287
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,870
Yeah? You didn't have
any more problems, did ya?

288
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,791
Nope.
Everything's fine, Dad.

289
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,030
I'd be glad to help
by talking to your professors.

290
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,237
- I'd be glad to look at your...
- I said everything's fine.

291
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,795
Well, good.

292
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,871
Good.

293
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,074
- He's had a few, huh?
- It's his birthday.

294
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,471
Good night!
Good night, Mary!

295
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,471
- Good night, guys.
- Good night... What's his name?

296
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,597
Hewitt.

297
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,114
Hewitt. That's...

298
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,918
Don't do anything.
I'll do it in the morning, honey.

299
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,948
Well, thank you,
thank you one and all for a...

300
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,877
a beautiful birthday.

301
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,957
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, Dad.

302
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,157
Happy birthday, darling.

303
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,312
- Good night. Uh-huh.
- Good night?

304
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,954
You're not going to bed.
You're not going to sleep, anyway.

305
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,998
- Oh, God.
- I have to get up early, you know.

306
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,911
I have Dr. Cohn in the morning.

307
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,754
Shh!

308
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,274
Oh, do you like Bette Midler?

309
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,153
Oh! You.

310
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,993
Come on. Come on.

311
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,071
Just one.

312
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,991
I don't care about that.

313
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,712
I knew my mother was going
to the doctor, but, uh...

314
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,196
I didn't really know
what for.

315
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,511
So you didn't ask.

316
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,789
No.

317
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,348
What poem begins,
"'Twas the night before Christmas"?

318
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,392
Uh, it's not called,
"'Twas the night before Christmas."

319
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,040
It's called, uh... I can recite
the whole thing. Does that count?

320
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,156
Anybody need any coffee?

321
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,760
- We just need the title. No, thank you.
- No? Okay.

322
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,519
- I'm gonna go through the whole thing.
- Don't let him cheat!

323
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,875
Please!

324
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,830
Oh, my God.
"A Visit from St. Nick."

325
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,872
Oh, man! Don't I get the point?

326
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,797
Hey!

327
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,590
- Where's Mom?
- They're going to keep her overnight.

328
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,434
She's going to have to have surgery.

329
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,591
Surgery?

330
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,952
Yes, they're...
They're going to try to take it out.

331
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,157
It's cancer?

332
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,549
- Are they sure?
- I'm going back out there to spend the night.

333
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,917
Is she going to die?

334
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,794
No, she's not going to die.

335
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:53,034
After the operation, she may need
radiation or chemotherapy.

336
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,674
The doctor said that
that can be very debilitating...

337
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,116
in which case she would need somebody
to take care of her during the day.

338
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,951
Actually, l...

339
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,112
I want you to-to move home...

340
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,272
to take care of her.

341
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,515
Move home?

342
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:17,031
- Brian is at school.
- Dad, what about my job?

343
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,078
Well, you can
freelance from here.

344
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,953
She's going to need help
during the day.

345
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,917
Well...

346
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,434
Maybe you could take sabbatical.
I mean, it's been four years since...

347
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,715
- you took one for the novel.
- A sabbatical is out of the question.

348
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,758
I have a department to run,
and I have to make a living.

349
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,957
As you well know, the advance
on my novel was spent years ago...

350
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,871
on yours and Brian's education.

351
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,954
Dad, I have to do my interviews
and my research in New York.

352
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,508
You know my job.
I cannot just drop everything.

353
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,632
I may never catch up again.
It could ruin my career.

354
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,075
- We can get a nurse and I will come home every weekend.
- A nurse?

355
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,908
We're not getting a nurse. Your mother
didn't get a nurse when you had chicken pox.

356
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,794
A nurse. You know she won't tolerate
having strangers in this house.

357
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,310
- But, Dad...
- Your mother needs you, Ellen. Jesus Christ!

358
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,198
You've got a Harvard education,
but where is your heart?

359
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,031
Excuse me.

360
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,756
- Honey? Hi.
- Hey.

361
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,549
- So sorry I'm late. Sorry. Hey, Jules.
- Hi. Bye.

362
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,552
- Okay. Hi. Mmm, kiss.
- Hi.

363
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,871
You okay?

364
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,951
Here, give me your bag.

365
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,310
- What's the matter? She's what?
- My mom is sick.

366
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,076
Ellen, a sick mother means
three weeks off...

367
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,310
and a very nice arrangement
of flowers sent by the staff.

368
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,960
Yeah, still holding.
You're doing great here.

369
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,110
If you leave there's no guarantee. All
I could offer you is some freelance work.

370
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,830
Okay, but I'm still going to finish
the Sullivan piece from home.

371
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,395
How are you going to do that?

372
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,597
- Actually, Casey said that he has a way into Sullivan too.
- No.

373
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,592
This is my piece.
I can do it.

374
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,676
Okay. I know what this is about.

375
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,591
You want an upgrade.

376
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,989
Well, you got it.
I don't know what it is yet...

377
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,036
but it's yours.

378
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,715
You really think that
someone would come in here...

379
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,917
and say that their mother
has cancer for a promotion?

380
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,151
Ellen, this is New York.

381
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,837
Ellen Gulden.

382
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,871
Hello, sweetheart. It's Dad.

383
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,797
Hi, Dad.

384
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,515
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

385
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,435
- Listen, I'm really sorry.
- I'm sorry too.

386
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,315
Don't forget
to make an extra set of keys...

387
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,749
- in case you need to get in.
- I know. I know. You know what I need to do?

388
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,677
- I've got to disconnect the phone.
- Yes, by Wednesday.

389
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,597
- By Wednesday.
- Okay. I'll call then.

390
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,473
- When is she moving in? Saturday?
- Thursday.

391
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,398
- Okay. What are you gonna do?
- Call you when I get there.

392
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:13,029
- You always forget, then I worry.
- I won't forget. I promise.

393
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,350
Thanks. Okay.

394
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,834
Sweetie, I'm all nervous.

395
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,957
I've never asked anybody
to live with me.

396
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,429
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'm gonna miss you too.

397
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,117
Ellie?

398
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,469
- You're home!
- Mm-hmm.

399
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:38,991
I was just... I was remembering when
I moved these plates from Princeton.

400
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:43,119
- Oh, yeah.
- Remember? And Brian was practicing juggling.

401
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,151
- So, how are you?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

402
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,077
- Good.
- I just have to take it easy.

403
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,350
My oncologist, who is...
you'll love this...

404
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,312
a woman,
says no upholstering...

405
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,675
no furniture refinishing.

406
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,035
Oh, no. What are you gonna do?

407
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,237
Can you stay
the whole weekend?

408
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:05,752
Uh, didn't Dad...
Oh, he didn't...

409
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,674
Well, um,
I'm home for a while.

410
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,274
I took some time off from work.

411
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:16,069
Home where? Here?
Well, what about your job...

412
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,991
and your little apartment
and everything?

413
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,389
Well, I'm gonna work
from here, so...

414
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,436
- Oh, don't worry about it.
- Oh, no.

415
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,357
- Tweedy said that it's fine.
- Oh, no, no, no.

416
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,277
Not to play nursemaid to me.

417
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,595
- Oh, no. That's not...
- Oh, I don't need...

418
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,148
Man, you'll hate me.
I'll just make you some dinner.

419
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,071
No, I want to stay.

420
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,310
At least until you feel better.

421
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,960
I mean, it's the right thing.

422
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,796
For who?

423
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,876
- Whose idea was this?
- Mine.

424
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,431
Dad, and...
Well, it was both of ours.

425
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,399
He shouldn't have asked you to do this,
honey, because he knows you.

426
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,432
- He knows this will never work.
- No. Now, I told Dad...

427
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,789
that I want to do this
and I'm going to.

428
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,950
So, that's final.
Okay?

429
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,191
Okay. Okay.

430
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,471
Okay. Oh, my girl.

431
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,910
I'm gonna make you
some cinnamon toast.

432
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,389
And I'll get you
a cup of tea too.

433
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,317
Okay.

434
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,029
I'm glad you're home. Thanks.

435
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,031
She didn't know I was coming.

436
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,594
Well, you know how
your mother is.

437
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,517
If she'd known...

438
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,790
she probably would've redecorated
your entire bedroom.

439
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,115
What's that smell?

440
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,670
Um, that is
an old writer's trick.

441
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,440
Schiller believed that
his body sabotaged...

442
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,869
the attention of his mind
while he was writing.

443
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,791
So, he engaged his body...

444
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,919
with a simple stimulant, apples...

445
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,911
to free his mind.

446
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,959
So far, all it's done for me is
make me hungry for apple pie á la mode.

447
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,191
So, what have you been
working on recently?

448
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,151
My interview with James Sullivan.

449
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,755
- Senator Sullivan?
- Mm-hmm.

450
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,917
That's impressive.
That's a big story.

451
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,992
You know, I've been
meaning to ask you.

452
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,508
Random House has been asking me
who I'd like to write...

453
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,469
the introduction to Volume Two
of my Collected Essays.

454
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,438
It's coming out in the spring.

455
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,357
Feel free to say no,
but if you had the time...

456
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,550
how would you feel
about writing the introduction?

457
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,229
- Are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.

458
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:48,400
- I would love to.
- Great. Great.

459
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:53,195
They envision some biographical sketch
or interview perhaps.

460
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,073
- I'll help you write the questions, if you want.
- Okay.

461
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,634
Here's some literary criticism...

462
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,557
in case you haven't
seen any of that recently.

463
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,353
And two, three examples of my work
in case you don't carry that...

464
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,510
around in your bags
with you wherever you go.

465
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,431
And, wait.

466
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,477
Wow.

467
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,796
Could you wash these for me?
No starch.

468
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,711
And this pocket
needs to be stitched.

469
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,071
Thanks for taking care of this.

470
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,919
Ellie!
Tell Dad dinner's on the table.

471
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,838
Sweetie, later on tonight,
I'm gonna run you a vanilla bath.

472
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,831
That'll help you
go to sleep. Okay?

473
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,034
- Morning.
- Good morning.

474
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,236
Good morning
Mary sunshine

475
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,118
Did you wake so soon

476
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,158
- Remember when we used to sing you that?
- Nope.

477
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,670
I see the decorating season
has officially begun.

478
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,395
- Our quarterback is suiting up.
- Mmm.

479
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,311
Oh, George.
You love it when...

480
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,073
the Minnies decorate
the Christmas trees.

481
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,835
You just pretend to be Scrooge.

482
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,514
- Mm-mm-mm. Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

483
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,632
Good day. Don't forget you have
a staff meeting at 3:00.

484
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,790
- Oh, yeah. I'll see you gals tonight.
- Okay.

485
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,715
Mmm. I wish I had redone
this kitchen years ago...

486
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,955
when I had the money to do it.

487
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,877
- You okay?
- Yeah, I just...

488
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,956
I'm a little tired.

489
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,918
I have my big
Minnie luncheon today.

490
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,470
Just the thought of
all those Minnies is tiring.

491
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,592
- I can make the lunch.
- You could make the lunch?

492
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,511
Yeah, I'll call out
for Chinese...

493
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,353
- or make some tuna fish sandwiches.
- No, no.

494
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,238
This is the steering committee lunch
where we plan the Christmas trees.

495
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,959
It's very important.
I'm gonna make chicken paillard...

496
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,508
zucchini soup,
and my heavenly chocolate cake.

497
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,431
Well, that's what
I'll make then.

498
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,308
You can make chicken paillard
and zucchini soup and chocolate cake?

499
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:12,235
Yeah. Just show me how.
It can't be that hard.

500
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,271
Crap.

501
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,153
Oh, shit! Mom!

502
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,077
Can you come here, quick?

503
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,997
No, I saw it on Donahue.

504
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,635
This woman said a UFO landed
and took away her husband.

505
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,599
- A UFO?
- And the UFO's name was probably Jennifer or Sophia.

506
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,511
Yeah, but she saw something,
you know...

507
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,434
and I think there are things in this world
that are mysterious and unexplainable.

508
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,233
Yeah, like remember
when they had one calorie Tab.

509
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,675
I was always wondering why the need
for that one calorie at all.

510
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,036
Oh, there you are.

511
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,112
Ellie made the lunch.

512
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,993
Since Ellie made the lunch,
let's make her an honorary Minnie.

513
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,918
Oh, yes, honey.

514
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,798
- Come on in and sit down.
- I'm going to the library. I have work to do.

515
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,678
- Oh, come on.
- Let's make Ellie an honorary Minnie.

516
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,029
Come on in. Come on.
Bring the cake when you come.

517
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,595
- A cake.
- She did all this by herself.

518
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,511
- She made a cake?
- That is dear.

519
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,630
- And I slept on the couch all morning.
- That's really nice...

520
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,632
but I really have
to finish my article.

521
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:14,798
And I couldn't be a Minnie.
There's really nothing Minnie about me.

522
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,836
- Oh, don't be silly.
- I don't even like Christmas.

523
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,440
Oh, Ellie. Ellie can help Kate
with her Christmas tree.

524
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,994
Welcome to the Minnies.

525
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,550
Now moving on
to other Minnie matters.

526
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,634
It was... It was awful.

527
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,557
It was awful.

528
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,319
- Mmm.
- I guess that that world...

529
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:39,757
it, um...
it just felt small to me.

530
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:45,073
And, uh, and sometimes I felt
like I was going crazy.

531
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:49,995
But since my mom was
so good at decorating...

532
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,230
and doing those creative things
around the house...

533
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,393
I suggested that she do
something with her talent...

534
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,113
like, uh,
like decorate professionally.

535
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,037
Start her own business.

536
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,117
- You're kidding.
- No, it would be fun.

537
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,191
Ellie, this is the Minnies'
busiest season. You know that.

538
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,430
We have the Halloween festival
for the kids.

539
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,239
We have Thanksgiving,
a benefit for the older people...

540
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,272
and then we have to decorate all
the Christmas trees in the town square.

541
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,151
Okay.

542
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,235
Well...

543
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,113
- Why-Why... You gonna
make coffee now? - Uh-huh.

544
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,196
How are you gonna get
to sleep tonight if...

545
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,117
It really doesn't affect me.

546
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,151
Mm-hmm.

547
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,873
We could do, um...

548
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,070
a project.

549
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,350
- A project?
- Mm-hmm.

550
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,271
You and me.
Something we could do together.

551
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,191
- Together.
- Yeah, something different...

552
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,556
that you would like, like...

553
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,598
- a book club.
- A book club?

554
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,517
Why do you keep repeating
everything I say as if it's...

555
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,516
- the most remarkable thing that you ever heard?
- I'm sorry. Okay.

556
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,434
- No, a book club. That's good. Who else should we have?
- No one.

557
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,040
- No one?
- There you go again.

558
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,119
- Okay. A book club.
- Mm-hmm.

559
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:15,119
- I hate what Jane Austen does in this book too.
- What? What?

560
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,839
Well, she...

561
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,599
The way she makes Jane,
the sweet...

562
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,911
and domestic one,
the good one.

563
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,520
She makes her second fiddle
to Elizabeth...

564
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,830
the one who's
the outspoken and smart one.

565
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,440
They do it at the college too...
women professors.

566
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,830
They say, "Oh, you keep house.
That's terribly interesting."

567
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,150
- Yeah, but I don't see...
- There's another book that does that.

568
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:42,115
Little Women. Yes, the writer's
sister, um, she puts her...

569
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,390
in opposition to the other one
that has babies.

570
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,835
- But, what...
- Meg.

571
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,911
So, you wanted to get back
to New York?

572
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,072
- Right.
- You felt like you were wasting your time?

573
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,918
Sort of. She seemed okay.

574
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,394
- Your anger and resentment were building up.
- Yes.

575
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,189
Well, I mean...

576
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,431
No, um...

577
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,751
The one thing that
I never wanted to do...

578
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:12,550
was to live my mother's life,
and there I was doing it.

579
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,670
Oh, this is my favorite!

580
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:18,799
No! Not Bette Midler, Mom. Please.

581
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,717
Oh, you like this one.

582
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,637
It's just every time
we get in the car...

583
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,557
I'm gonna get me
some of them

584
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,718
Cause you got
to have friends

585
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,469
Ba, ba, ba, ba
ba, ba, ba, ba

586
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,154
Friends

587
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:39,472
- Harmonize with me!
- But you're doing so nicely on your own.

588
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,120
Friends

589
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,879
I'm talking about friends

590
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,394
- Mom, when are we gonna
turn around and head home?

591
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,275
I told you. We have to go get yarn,
sweetheart. Remember?

592
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,074
- Thank you, Kate.
- Okay, sweetheart. Come sit up with me.

593
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,997
I'll see you next week,
if I'm spared.

594
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,158
Thank you again.
I love your mother!

595
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,717
Bye!

596
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,592
Oh.

597
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:23,076
Well, I think
she had fun though, don't you?

598
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,111
No idea.

599
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,031
Honey, give me a pill, will ya?
In the...

600
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,759
Yeah. Look, we've been driving
around for hours...

601
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,719
- There's a thermos down there too.
- Wasting time.

602
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,917
You don't feel well
and I need to meet Dad.

603
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,956
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

604
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,956
- You know where we are?
- Canada.

605
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,669
We just dropped Clarice off
at her mother's house.

606
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,355
That's because she's been living there
for four months...

607
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,829
since her husband left her,
and she hit rock bottom.

608
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,912
And she stays inside all day
with the shades drawn.

609
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,831
Every day.

610
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,150
So, one of us
comes up once a week...

611
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,077
and takes her out
to have some fun, you know.

612
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,509
Have some laughs.

613
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,438
And that's what we did today.

614
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,069
I hope.

615
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,151
You could always do work study.

616
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,071
Right, and do what?

617
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,914
You can work in the library.
That's easy.

618
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,072
He's not here.

619
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,991
So, who's he doing now?

620
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,594
Probably Celine, his new T.A.

621
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,797
You mean "T and A."

622
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,711
I'd do him.

623
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,631
Not me.
He's way too critical.

624
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,551
I mean, can you imagine?

625
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,393
"You have real talent,
but you must reach, goddamn it."

626
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,517
- Hello?
- Hi, Kate.

627
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,790
- Uh, George wanted me to give you a call.
- Harold.

628
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,711
- Yeah, hi.
- Oh, hi.

629
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,349
Yes. Ellie, is that you?
I have it.

630
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,277
Sorry.

631
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,879
So, when you worked
with James Sullivan...

632
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,629
- would you say that he was driven?
- Oh, absolutely.

633
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:19,508
Uh-huh.
How about voracious?

634
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,398
What about
his drug use back then?

635
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,311
- Did you find it?
- I'm coming... now.

636
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,391
Thank you very much.
You've been really helpful.

637
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,233
- What?
- Coming. Could you come now, please?

638
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,151
What?

639
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:35,438
- What is it?
- I've given her two, um, Percocets about an hour ago...

640
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,351
but they don't seem
to be taking an effect.

641
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,635
- L... I can't give her any more.
- No, absolutely not.

642
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:43,315
- What's going on? - Well, I
can't find the-the heating pad.

643
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,392
I need it.
I need the heating pad.

644
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,436
- We didn't find it.
- You want the heating pad? Okay.

645
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,351
She's in horrible pain.
She hasn't slept all night long.

646
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,034
- You woke Ellie up. I told you not to wake her.
- I'm sorry.

647
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,714
I think l... Oh, I hung it...

648
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,797
Ellen, please.

649
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:02,355
Here, here, here. Here we go.
Now I just have to plug it in.

650
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:06,194
- Has she got it?
- Turn it on. Yeah.

651
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,558
Yeah, she got it.
It's good.

652
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,115
- You can go now. You can go to work.
- You think?

653
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,350
- Yeah. Go to class now. It's okay.
- All right.

654
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,558
- What else now? What else?
- I'll wait for Dr. Cohn to call.

655
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,359
And, um, I'll cancel the reservation
at the Porchlight tonight, Kate.

656
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,958
Yeah, that's good.

657
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,230
- Shit! Jesus.
- Go.

658
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:36,711
Go.

659
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,509
- The pill didn't work yet, baby.
- Just wait a little longer.

660
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,471
Is it getting warm?

661
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,518
Yeah, somewhat.

662
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,431
Yeah.

663
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,513
I'm giving her Dilaudid
for her pain.

664
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,398
It may make her a little groggy.

665
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,598
And she shouldn't drive.
Her speech may be a little slurred.

666
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,955
Even though you may see some
transient periods of improvement...

667
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,560
she still shouldn't drive
while she's on this medication.

668
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,471
Okay.

669
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,676
I want to send a nurse
to monitor her vital signs.

670
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,075
In fact, this afternoon.

671
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,152
No, we don't need a nurse.
I can handle this.

672
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,356
I insist. Your mother's
in a great deal of pain.

673
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,556
She needs someone
she can be open with about it.

674
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,433
Well, she can be open with me.

675
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,675
Can she?

676
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:30,675
- Still beating?
- Loud and clear.

677
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,876
Now, what can I do
to help you, Mrs. Gulden?

678
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:36,754
Tell me about your pain.
Is it constant?

679
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:39,308
Mm-hmm. Pretty much, yes.

680
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:43,598
But, um, this medication's
really helping me now.

681
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:48,993
Okay. Are you having trouble
bathing and dressing?

682
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,996
Well, sometimes I have
a little trouble...

683
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,435
getting in and out of the tub.

684
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,080
You didn't tell me that.

685
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,991
Why didn't you tell me that?

686
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:02,153
Oh, Ellie. There's so many things
for you to worry about.

687
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,589
Well, let's go upstairs.

688
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,433
I can show you some easy ways
to get in and out of the tub.

689
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,351
Okay.

690
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,077
Mm-hmm.

691
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,391
Are you having problems
with anything else?

692
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,597
Uh-uh. No.
Everything's, uh...

693
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,359
Sometimes bending down.

694
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,715
You know, it's hard.
Hard to get my trousers on sometimes.

695
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,916
- Mm-hmm.
- And, um...

696
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,238
But my bed is nice and high, so I have
no trouble getting in and out of there.

697
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:56,510
- All right. Kate, I have a surprise.
- Hi.

698
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,916
You have to close your eyes.

699
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:03,839
- Oh.
- And keep them closed. Please, no cheating.

700
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,913
- Ellen, you too.
- What are you doing?

701
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:33,034
- What have you...
- No, no. Don't open your eyes just yet.

702
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:40,038
- Ready? Open.
- It's so...

703
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,036
Oh, it's so...

704
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:45,032
If you can't go to the
Porchlight, the Porchlight comes to you.

705
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,194
It's...

706
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,834
fabulous.

707
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,869
Oh, my.

708
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:14,709
I don't believe it.

709
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,631
Here.

710
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,717
Mmm. Oh.

711
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,392
It's so beautiful.

712
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:35,639
And after dinner,
I've rented your favorite movie.

713
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,071
You awake?

714
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,470
- Go back to bed.
- I can't go to sleep.

715
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,471
Go back to bed.

716
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,397
Whatcha got in the box?

717
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,399
Nothing. Go back to bed.

718
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,750
I guess she doesn't need her pill.

719
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,756
No. She's looking a lot better now.

720
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:20,037
She's gonna be just fine.

721
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,317
- Dad?
- Yeah.

722
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,231
I was just thinking
that maybe...

723
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:32,029
you could cut back on your classes,
help out a little.

724
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,957
Ellie, I'd like to...

725
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,355
but this is the busiest time
of the semester for me.

726
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,279
I've got midterms, which means
I've got evening tutorials.

727
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:44,239
Didn't you see her this morning?
She's getting worse.

728
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:49,479
No, she's not.
Don't you ever say that again.

729
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:53,308
- But, Dad...
- Ellen.

730
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,991
Look, I have essays to grade.

731
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,594
And I've got a deadline.

732
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,517
Dad, if I don't finish
this article...

733
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,437
I'm never going
to get my job back.

734
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,268
- Don't you realize that?
- Ellen, enough. Midterms.

735
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:27,634
I can see why people would think
that I didn't care.

736
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:31,156
But I just didn't know
what to do.

737
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:36,792
My mom would have a couple of bad days,
and then she'd be fine.

738
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:42,950
And, uh, she was still doing
the things she'd always done. So...

739
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,673
I was just wondering
if you could tell me...

740
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,354
when he's gonna be released
from rehab.

741
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,278
I'm just trying to be a friend,
which I'm sure that he needs right now.

742
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,197
Is a friend of yours
in trouble?

743
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:56,869
I'm-I'm sorry.
Can you hold on just a second?

744
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,956
It's a work thing.

745
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,036
Oh, I thought
you said a friend.

746
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:04,032
Anyhow, the reason why I'm asking
is because I'm sure that he's gonna...

747
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:08,392
- Are you... Are you gonna get ready soon, because...
- I'm sorry.

748
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,710
Um, I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

749
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,109
It's kind of important.

750
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:17,193
Okay. So anyhow, I need
to know because I think...

751
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,111
You don't have to come
if you don't want to, you know.

752
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,237
- You really don't have to come. It's fine.
- I'm sorry. Just a second.

753
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:27,154
You do know that this is
exactly what the Moonies do?

754
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:30,471
They take your shoes,
your clothing, your identity.

755
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:33,990
You sure the Minnies aren't
just an offshoot of the Moonies?

756
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:37,350
Well, at least you're
wearing your favorite color.

757
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,277
Next goblin, please.

758
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,470
Come on.

759
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,229
Look!
Two more Madonnas.

760
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:49,757
- Hey, Kate.
- There's Clarice.

761
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,638
Go back to work.
Go back.

762
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,950
- Louise, give me a pie. I got to go first.
- Oh, no.

763
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,560
You stand over there.
Stand over there. Stand over...

764
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,591
Shh. Kate, don't make me laugh.

765
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,671
- Home? Good.
- Yes, darling.

766
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,274
- Hang in there.
- Let me see. No. Maybe I'll...

767
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:36,874
Oh, my God! Evelyn.

768
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,715
- You know, I really should get home.
- Okay.

769
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,631
We'll go... pretty soon.

770
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:46,075
I just want to go around one more time.

771
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,196
Okay.
One more time.

772
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:53,152
- But only once.
- One more.

773
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,630
Okay.
One more time.

774
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,029
Okay.

775
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:12,233
- Whew.
- Whew, look at the little leaves.

776
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,788
Like they're in a big hurry
to get somewhere.

777
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,913
Those Minnies go all out.

778
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,554
- Yep, they do.
- They go all out.

779
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:23,756
Very creative women, huh?

780
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:27,190
- Yes. What?
- More is more.

781
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,510
- You know, your dad always
says less is more. - Mm-hmm.

782
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,830
To me, more is more.

783
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,559
Oh, I love walking in Langhorne.

784
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:39,270
My gosh, look at what Evelyn Best
has done here.

785
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:42,835
Uh-huh.

786
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,991
It's a beautiful night.

787
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,594
Are you okay?

788
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,995
- Mom?
- Uh-huh. You hear that?

789
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,715
- What? Hear what?
- That.

790
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,990
What?

791
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:02,470
Why, I guess it's the rumble
of the furnaces or something.

792
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:06,593
You know, Langhorne kind of,
I don't know, hums.

793
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:11,031
It's... Even in the summertime
you can hear...

794
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,759
Maybe it's the air conditioners...

795
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:16,559
crickets, or the bees.

796
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,471
Hmm.

797
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,719
No, I think it's something more.
You hear it?

798
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,117
No.

799
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:29,390
You can feel it.

800
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:35,158
Trick-or-treaters. Oh, my gosh.

801
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,629
They're gonna beat us home.
You go get your dad up at the college.

802
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,557
- Tell him to hurry up.
- Are you sure?

803
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,239
Yeah, I know he's doesn't
want to miss this fun.

804
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,436
Trick-or-treat.
Trick-or-treat.

805
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,671
Dad.

806
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:14,150
- Hi.
- Hi.

807
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,231
Well, you missed
all the trick-or-treaters.

808
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,629
They were so cute.

809
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,551
Remember when Brian
dressed up like a dice?

810
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,751
And he tipped over
and you wouldn't help him up...

811
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,115
because you were so busy
laughing at his little legs...

812
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:29,720
scrambling around in the air
like a bug.

813
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:35,912
- Did you find your dad?
- His secretary said he had a late class.

814
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:41,990
Oh. That's too bad.

815
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,395
You okay, Ellie?

816
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,069
- Uh-huh. Great.
- Good.

817
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,714
I love this movie.

818
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,671
Do you think
about politics much?

819
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:00,952
And if so, what do you think
about politics?

820
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:43,191
You know how some of these
meetings can go. Some of the faculty...

821
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,953
- Uh-huh. - You know, one of
the students had a little...

822
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,675
- Oh.
- So he, uh, he just wanted me to call.

823
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:52,712
- Okay.
- He thought you... Yeah, he thought you shouldn't...

824
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,115
He didn't want you to worry.

825
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,317
- All right. Thank you, Harold.
- It's just...

826
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:02,035
Yeah, it's just another one
of those meetings.

827
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:06,671
Ellen?

828
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:10,757
- Ellen?
- Hmm?

829
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:15,430
I was asking about your father.
You haven't really mentioned him.

830
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:18,956
- Was he not around that much?
- No, he was around.

831
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:22,635
Um, he was busy with his classes...

832
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:26,599
but-but he managed
to spend time at home.

833
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,832
I looked at my American Express
bill one January...

834
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,155
and went into ring failure.

835
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:34,710
I was so opposed to name tags that once
when a women slapped a gummed label...

836
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,155
over my left bosom that said,
"Hello, my name is Erma..."

837
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,397
I leaned over and said,
"Now what shall we name the other one?"

838
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:43,159
What are you reading?

839
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:46,073
Aunt Erma's Cope Book:

840
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,958
How To Get From Monday
To Friday In Twelve Days.

841
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,871
- Hey, guys?
- Up here.

842
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,873
- Shall I put it away?
- You'd better or else he'll call the thought police.

843
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,428
And they'll come in in tweed jackets...

844
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,592
and pummel us with rolled up
New York Times.

845
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:03,274
Whoa! Is this dissension
in the ranks?

846
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,880
Should I do my reading
from this tonight?

847
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:10,317
No. No readings this Thanksgiving.
Nobody even likes the readings.

848
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,836
- It's just gonna be us.
- And Jordan.

849
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,388
Wait a minute. You're gonna buck
26 years of tradition?

850
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:19,830
You're gonna take away Frost and Whitman
and all those other exciting dead guys?

851
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,956
- Are you feeling all right?
- Shut up.

852
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,675
You are not going to believe
who is downstairs with Harold.

853
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,876
Oliver Most...

854
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,150
poet laureate, in our house.

855
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:36,712
- What is that book?
- Oh, it's mine.

856
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:40,958
Ellen, could you put up, like, some
hors d'oeuvres or something for them?

857
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,951
Are they staying?

858
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,871
Yeah.

859
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,549
- Hmm.
- Uh-huh. Great.

860
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,592
- Dad?
- Yeah.

861
00:57:55,680 --> 00:58:00,196
It was just supposed
to be Jordan and us, just family.

862
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:04,279
Well, I mean...

863
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:08,638
They have no place else to go. Oliver is
down from Harvard for a book-signing tour.

864
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:12,429
He's all by himself. Come on. You know
your mother loves Oliver Most's work.

865
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:14,272
You promised.

866
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:16,993
Well, I can't very well
disinvite them now, can I?

867
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:22,156
And we could all use a little
holiday cheer around here now.

868
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:25,710
Couldn't we?

869
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,758
Get up!

870
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:39,435
- Okay. Thank you.
- Oh, Ellen. You did this?

871
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:42,990
- Oh, Ellie.
- You don't have to be concerned with things like that.

872
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,355
- There's plenty of time.
- I have to pay my father when I get back.

873
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,318
- I don't know if I feel good about it.
- Would you like some wine?

874
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,709
Well, you know,
there is plenty of time.

875
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:54,634
A writer writes something.
He calls his friend. He says...

876
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:58,156
"I'm finished writing a little
something, and it's not very good.

877
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:02,273
In fact, it's terrible. The worse part
about it is it's the best thing I can do."

878
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:06,074
And that was Steinbeck,
Grapes of Wrath.

879
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,879
Your father tells me you write
literary reviews from time to time.

880
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:12,999
- Mm-hmm. That's right. - That's
interesting. Like father, like daughter.

881
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:16,350
Tell me, have you ever had the
opportunity to review any of my work?

882
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,277
Um...

883
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,751
- I want to say grace now.
- Oh, good.

884
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:29,918
Uh, no, George,
I want to say my own grace.

885
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:33,071
Of course.

886
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,919
Thank you for the world so sweet.

887
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,709
Thank you for the food we eat.

888
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,911
Thank you for the birds that sing.

889
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:54,430
Thank you, God, for everything.

890
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:59,952
And thank you, Ellie, for making
such a beautiful Thanksgiving dinner.

891
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:02,395
Sure.

892
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:06,678
- Bravo.
- To Chef Boyardee.

893
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:10,753
- Shut up. That's terrible.
- Well...

894
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,677
to our great surprise and delight...

895
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:16,110
tonight has become a night to go down
in our family's history books.

896
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:19,636
We have the honor to have
with us Oliver Most, who...

897
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:22,188
whose work means so much to me...

898
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:26,831
and who was the first to encourage me
with Comeback Inn.

899
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:30,435
He's agreed after dinner
to read to us from his new book...

900
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,357
for which l...

901
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,356
I'm very grateful.

902
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:37,113
Well, George, I'm happy to oblige...

903
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:41,193
but you're gonna have
to remind me.

904
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,953
What in the hell is Comeback Inn?

905
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:48,079
It sounds as if I've encouraged you
to invest in some sort of...

906
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:52,711
uh, roadside motel.

907
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,950
Honey, would you pass
the vegetables around?

908
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,554
Yeah. You want
some carrots, sweetheart?

909
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,631
That's my novel.

910
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:05,509
- My novel.
- Yeah.

911
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:08,836
Well, Jesus, George.
I'm sorry. I forgot.

912
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:13,317
As Thurber says,
"With 60 staring me in the face...

913
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:17,194
"I've developed inflammation
of the sentence structure...

914
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:21,671
- a definite hardening of the paragraph."
- Everything looks beautiful.

915
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:28,075
Up in my blue room

916
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:35,316
Fools rush in
and not to bed

917
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,153
I am the rich
of the real dead head

918
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,758
Sure am gonna love you
one more time

919
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:48,673
Little bit of whiskey
Little bit of my mind

920
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:54,913
Well, you don't know
the things I see in here

921
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,190
Hey, did you see my dad tonight?

922
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,316
He just kills me.

923
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:01,834
You know, he doesn't say one word
to me about dinner...

924
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:04,348
and then he just goes off
to his study.

925
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,437
Like we're servants there
to serve him or something.

926
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:12,751
Hello? Another round.

927
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:15,832
- What are you, Janice Joplin? Take it easy on the sauce, okay?
- No. No.

928
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:18,878
- I have not been out in two months.
- I know.

929
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,791
- I deserve another drink.
- I know.

930
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,632
I deserve another drink...

931
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,234
especially since it's been
like that since the beginning.

932
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:27,470
Do you know
he doesn't do anything?

933
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:30,791
He really doesn't. He doesn't
do anything. I do everything.

934
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:33,155
- I do. I do everything.
- I realize that.

935
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,760
But I think in situations like this,
you have to...

936
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,677
be sympathetic with people.

937
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:40,598
I mean, everybody has to deal with
bad stuff in their own way, you know.

938
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:42,557
What?

939
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:50,753
Whenever you guys say that people
deal with stuff in their own way...

940
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:53,075
it means that you don't
deal with it at all.

941
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:55,549
We deal with it.
We make the meals...

942
01:02:55,600 --> 01:03:00,230
and we clean up the messes
and we listen while you guys...

943
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:04,552
talk about how you're gonna
deal with stuff in your own way.

944
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:08,673
Well, what way is that, Jordan?
Hmm? What way is that?

945
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,597
What way?

946
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:13,074
See? No way.

947
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:15,469
- And what the fuck are you looking at?
- Hey, hey.

948
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:17,391
- Huh?
- What are you doing? What are you doing?

949
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:20,233
- No, no, no. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being rude.
- What's the matter with you?

950
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:22,709
Well, you know what
I think is rude?

951
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,677
- I think it's rude...
- Hey, stop it. I'm trying to talk.

952
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:27,393
- When Little Miss Delta-Delta-Delta
over here... - Stop it. Stop it!

953
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,795
- Is trying to pick up on my boyfriend...
- Stop it. Stop it.

954
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:32,070
- In front of my face.
- Why don't you just lay off of her?

955
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,116
- Your sister's losing her mind.
- Do you think I look invisible?

956
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:36,276
I am not losing my mind!

957
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:39,636
I am not losing my mind!
I am just tired, Jordan.

958
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:42,632
- I am tired. I am tired.
- Ellen, let's go.

959
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,597
Being my mother is very tiring.

960
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:46,910
Oh, come on. There's nobody more
different than your mother than you.

961
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:49,428
- Come on. Let's go.
- That is the stupidest thing that you have ever said.

962
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,795
- Okay. Great.
- That's the stupidest thing you've ever said.

963
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,671
Oh, God.

964
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,913
- Ellie.
- Yeah.

965
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:22,118
- You all right?
- Yeah, I just have a headache.

966
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:25,072
- What happened to Jordan? I heard Brian go upstairs...
- Yeah, yeah.

967
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:28,072
He has to go to work tomorrow,
so he just took the train back.

968
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:30,754
Hmm. You sure you're all right?

969
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,360
How do you do this...

970
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,432
every day, all day in this house...

971
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:39,876
and no one notices?

972
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,831
Doesn't that drive you crazy?

973
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:47,390
But this is my family, Ellie.

974
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,795
These are the people I love.

975
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:55,071
Maybe it's time for you to start
thinking about going back to New York.

976
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:57,953
Maybe you should go back
to the city...

977
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,516
to your work and your writing and
all those things that you like to do.

978
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:06,798
That's what's important, sweetie.

979
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:12,069
You know, we can get somebody
to help out around here. That's not...

980
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:20,038
But you did a great job tonight.
You should be proud of yourself.

981
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:21,957
Night-night, sweetheart.

982
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:27,600
Good night.

983
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,671
Hello.

984
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,671
Mr. Tweedy, hi.

985
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:57,036
A press conference? Where?

986
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:01,757
The next train
is not till 5:00. Shit.

987
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:03,796
- Then Casey...
- No, don't send Casey. I'll be there.

988
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,117
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

989
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:30,113
Excuse me. No.
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

990
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,390
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

991
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,556
Too late is unacceptable.
You said you'd get the story.

992
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,511
And I will.
I'll find him.

993
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:59,755
Look, I've got a contact at Sullivan's
office. He's getting on a plane at 9:00.

994
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:02,274
No, no, no. I've worked
on this thing for three months.

995
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:04,834
- He's staying at the Plaza Athene. I can check it out.
- Anyone can figure that out.

996
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:07,758
No, I will meet him there. I'll meet
him at the Plaza Athene before he leaves.

997
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,876
This is my story,
goddamn it!

998
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:12,155
This is my story.

999
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:25,799
Good night, sir.

1000
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,469
Taxi!

1001
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:53,357
Hey, don't I know you?

1002
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:56,113
- I don't think so.
- Yes, we went to Harvard together.

1003
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,350
Ellen Gulden.
You were a couple of years ahead of me.

1004
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:02,956
I wrote for the women's magazine,
Peeved Eves.

1005
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:07,073
I remember Peeved Eves.

1006
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:10,635
- Well, it's nice to see you.
- Yeah, yeah. Nice to see you too.

1007
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:14,190
Got to get to J.F. K in time
for the last commuter shuttle.

1008
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:17,272
It's my daughter's
birthday today.

1009
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:20,511
If you're going to J.F. K,
I can give you a lift.

1010
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:26,270
I moved to Seattle a couple of months
ago to get away from all the cameras...

1011
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:29,835
my ex-wife and my ex-kids.

1012
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:33,435
Yeah, you know, I think I saw something
about that on television.

1013
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:37,274
- How horrible.
- You know what's strange?

1014
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:39,669
- One minute you're in school and the
next minute you look up... - Mm-hmm.

1015
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,591
And your life's all turned around
and screwed up.

1016
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:46,151
- Yes, I know. Yeah.
- You try and you try to get ahead.

1017
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:48,834
Somewhere in it all you just...

1018
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:51,440
You lose yourself.

1019
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:53,351
- And you never know when
it's gonna come. - Mm-hmm.

1020
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:57,399
Comes out of nowhere.
Bang. It's just...

1021
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:59,789
- Your life is a disaster.
- Yep.

1022
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,871
Oh, I just hope I can make it up
to my wife and kids.

1023
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:03,916
You know, that's all that counts.
That's all that counts.

1024
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,831
Yeah, you're right.

1025
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:10,152
They're the ones who love you.
That's what counts.

1026
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:21,671
I'm reading, Mom.
And baby cows are calves.

1027
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,794
You're right.

1028
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,949
G.A. Tweedy here.
Leave a message after the noise.

1029
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:54,112
Mr. Tweedy, it's Ellen.

1030
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:56,037
Uh...

1031
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:00,234
Listen, I waited
for Sullivan...

1032
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:04,068
outside of his hotel,
and, uh...

1033
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:07,749
Well, he never showed.

1034
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:14,639
Damn.

1035
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:17,832
Here we go.

1036
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:26,116
They're several reasons why I asked you
here today, one of which...

1037
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:28,594
- Hi, John. Peter.
- George.

1038
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:34,154
One of which is to ask you...

1039
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:39,274
why you were
so hostile with me...

1040
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,191
at Thanksgiving.

1041
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:45,592
I know this is not
the best situation for any of us.

1042
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:49,673
But I'm trying, Ellen.
I'm trying to be patient.

1043
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:01,192
I have some questions
that I'd like to discuss with you.

1044
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:04,556
- I don't think I want to talk about the interview.
- I do.

1045
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:09,711
Okay, Ellen.

1046
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:13,509
How come Mom waited so long?

1047
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:16,512
Why didn't she go
to the doctor sooner?

1048
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:21,031
- What are you talking about?
- Was it because you didn't want your world disrupted?

1049
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:24,908
Because you needed her
to keep your life running smoothly?

1050
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,831
Like you need me now?

1051
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:29,070
- What the hell are you doing?
- Because she can't do it all?

1052
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:33,756
Well, do you have any idea
what it takes to keep your life...

1053
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,479
- running so smoothly?
- Ellen, have you lost your mind?

1054
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:39,836
- Maybe.
- Keep your voice down.

1055
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:42,434
- This is inappropriate.
- It is appropriate!

1056
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:46,393
Everything at our house has changed,
but you don't know about it.

1057
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:49,916
Because you're behaving
as though life goes on as usual.

1058
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,470
Well, life as we know it is done!
This is real life!

1059
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:56,159
Fuck fiction!

1060
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:58,071
Less is not more!

1061
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:03,194
You have taken sabbaticals
for the great American novel.

1062
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:05,111
Why not one for Mom?

1063
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:08,875
Why won't you participate
in the most important thing...

1064
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:11,434
that has happened in your life?

1065
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:14,080
She needs you.

1066
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,675
Why is it always more important
for you to hear...

1067
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,558
what some writer has to say
than me?

1068
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:24,271
And Brian?

1069
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:29,236
Hey.

1070
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:37,836
Hey, what other tricks do you use
besides your fucking apples...

1071
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:41,595
to get your writing juices
flowing, Dad?

1072
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:43,671
Cheating on Mom, is that one?

1073
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:47,548
I will hire a full-time nurse.
You are going back to New York.

1074
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,875
What other tricks?

1075
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:57,153
Several people have mentioned...

1076
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:00,829
a heated argument that you had
with your father...

1077
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:03,997
outside the campus cafe.

1078
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:08,358
It was shortly
after Thanksgiving.

1079
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,277
Do you recall the incident?

1080
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:15,149
Uh-huh.
Yeah, I remember.

1081
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:23,078
It was a stressful time...

1082
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:26,999
and there was a lot to do
and it was hard.

1083
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:29,469
So, there was no problem
between you and your father?

1084
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:31,954
No.

1085
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:34,554
Or your father
and your mother?

1086
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:37,677
My mother and my father?

1087
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:40,911
Of course not.
It was a busy time.

1088
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,673
I mean, I was
a full-fledged Minnie.

1089
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:48,390
I remember we were making
the, uh, ornaments...

1090
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:50,471
the craft ornaments
with the feathers and the sequins...

1091
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:53,757
for my mother's
Christmas tree in the square.

1092
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,229
And, uh, I would climb
up the ladder...

1093
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:58,880
and she would tell me
where to put them.

1094
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:01,190
So, it was fun.

1095
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:04,951
It was a lot of fun.

1096
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:13,838
Yeah, it's really not that bad.

1097
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:15,831
Yeah, it's okay.

1098
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:19,310
You know, I always used to try
to get you to go see Santa.

1099
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:22,312
For years and years.
And then when you were 8 years old...

1100
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:26,871
you got in line and you went to
the very front, pulled his beard off...

1101
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:29,838
- Pulled his beard off.
- And yelled, "Fraud!"

1102
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:33,913
Your dad was so proud of you.

1103
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,195
Well, guess what?

1104
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:43,319
- I'm getting in the line. Yes.
- Oh, now you want to.

1105
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:51,675
- Uh-huh.
- Good girl. Go on. Be good.

1106
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:58,276
- Ellen Gulden.
- Hello.

1107
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,197
- Hi.
- I know what you want:

1108
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:03,232
A new computer
and Diane Sawyer's job.

1109
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:07,592
I'm here, okay?
Okay, here we go.

1110
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:14,478
Nothing for me, Mayor.

1111
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:18,633
Santa.

1112
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:22,309
I guess maybe it is for me.

1113
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:26,957
I really... l...

1114
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,231
Mom!

1115
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:36,669
Mom!

1116
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:39,518
Excuse me, is there
a phone that I can use?

1117
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,431
Sure.

1118
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,750
This line right here.
Press nine to get out.

1119
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:51,918
Answer the phone, Dad.

1120
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:43,751
Ellen?

1121
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:49,591
Mom's in the hospital.

1122
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:54,959
The cancer has progressed
much more quickly than we had expected.

1123
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:58,157
I'm sorry, but I think it's best
to stop the chemotherapy.

1124
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:07,753
Uh, you know what? Um, I'm not
ready to stop the chemotherapy.

1125
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:10,115
I'm afraid there's
no more we can do.

1126
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:13,436
We all need now to focus...

1127
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:15,875
on helping her through
this next part.

1128
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,797
I'm putting her on morphine.

1129
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:21,469
You'll need to give her
one tablet twice a day for the pain.

1130
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:24,910
They shouldn't be chewed or crushed
because they might become toxic.

1131
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:31,191
I am sorry.
I'll get you the prescription.

1132
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:48,069
So, what do you think of the wheels?

1133
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:50,355
Oh, they look wonderful.

1134
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:52,715
- You like 'em?
- Oh, gosh, it's like what we used to do...

1135
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:55,758
- to the bikes when you were kids.
- Uh-huh.

1136
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,671
- You look beautiful.
- Oh, Brian.

1137
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:59,591
You do.

1138
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:02,274
- No coat?
- No, I don't need one. I'm layered, honey.

1139
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:05,118
I just wanna show off
my new sweater.

1140
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:07,953
Oh, I love Christmas!

1141
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:10,315
I love it.

1142
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:12,630
- Hey!
- Hey, folks! Merry Christmas.

1143
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:14,711
- Merry Christmas.
- Hi!

1144
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:20,753
- Oh, everybody's out tonight.
- Are we late?

1145
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:24,276
They should shovel that, you know. They
should shovel that more carefully than that.

1146
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:26,316
- Well, honey, you should do it. Hey!
- Hey, you guys!

1147
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,311
- Merry Christmas.
- Hello.

1148
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:31,358
June Fortier.

1149
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:35,756
Get up here, you.

1150
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,831
Clarice Mitchell.

1151
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,234
- There she is.
- Oh, great!

1152
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:45,191
- Hi, Kate. How are you?
- Hi, Ellen. How are you?

1153
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:48,636
- Hi, Brian, George. Kate.
- Melissa Jamison.

1154
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:50,631
Well, you just look wonderful.
You look wonderful.

1155
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:52,716
- Well, thanks. Don't go get mushy on me.
- I just love the sweater.

1156
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:55,872
- Oh, thanks.
- Evelyn Best.

1157
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:03,440
Kate Gulden.

1158
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:25,638
And Ellen Gulden.

1159
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:27,989
We see you, Ellen.
You can't hide. Come on.

1160
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:30,674
- We need all the Minnies up here.
- Come on, now.

1161
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:40,790
And now for the moment
we have all been waiting for.

1162
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:43,030
Happy holidays, Langhorne!

1163
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:53,950
Silent night

1164
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:58,790
Holy night

1165
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:03,317
All is calm

1166
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:08,394
All is bright

1167
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:13,156
Round yon virgin

1168
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:17,830
Mother and child

1169
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:21,833
Holy infant

1170
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:27,040
So tender and mild

1171
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:30,192
Sleep in

1172
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:33,033
Heavenly

1173
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:37,392
Peace

1174
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:39,914
Sleep in

1175
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:44,715
Heavenly peace

1176
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:51,911
Silent night

1177
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:56,710
Holy night

1178
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:01,794
Shepherds quake

1179
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:06,152
At the sight

1180
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:11,075
Glories stream

1181
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:16,274
From heaven afar

1182
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:20,035
Heavenly hosts

1183
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:25,757
Sing alleluia

1184
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:30,152
Christ the Savior

1185
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:35,519
Is born

1186
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:39,752
Christ the Savior

1187
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:43,679
Is born

1188
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:54,756
Having trouble juggling everything.

1189
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,995
Gee, I haven't dropped one yet.

1190
01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:01,511
I couldn't help it. It was a reflex.

1191
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:07,670
Oh, here...

1192
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:09,990
- Oh, hi!
- Oh, my God!

1193
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:12,713
- Whoa!
- Hi.

1194
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:17,834
- Nice hat.
- Oh, thank you.

1195
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:20,309
- You didn't tell your mom?
- How could I tell her?

1196
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,516
She's never known
about my dad's little flings.

1197
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:26,479
God, he's still doing it, you know?
He's got this friend...

1198
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:30,314
this fucking Harold guy,
who calls and makes excuses for him.

1199
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:33,358
And this woman, she dropped him off
right in front of the house.

1200
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:36,995
- God!
- Oh, God. Why won't he answer?

1201
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:40,350
This is the third time
I've tried to call him today.

1202
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:42,277
The red and gold one is ours.

1203
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:47,349
- Oh. Hey, it's beautiful.
- Mm-hmm.

1204
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:50,591
My mom says with a tree that size,
the key is "gaudy."

1205
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:54,599
- More is more.
- What are you doing? Ellen, don't call him again.

1206
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:56,870
I don't want him to worry.

1207
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:59,599
He's still really upset about
Thanksgiving and I think that...

1208
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:01,995
he was afraid to come
and visit me for the holidays.

1209
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:04,514
- Oh, please!
- No, I'm serious.

1210
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:08,155
- I was really, really hard on him.
- Ellen!

1211
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:12,950
- Hello?
- Hi. Is Jordan there?

1212
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:16,032
Yeah, he's paying for the Chinese food.
Do you wanna hold on?

1213
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:18,878
No, that's okay.

1214
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:24,875
Some girl answered and said
that he was paying...

1215
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:27,918
the Chinese delivery guy.

1216
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:30,269
Okay, uh, Chinese food at home.

1217
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:33,676
- It's New Year's.
- Shit!

1218
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:37,395
- Shit!
- Shit! Don't call him again.

1219
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:40,358
EI!

1220
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:43,517
Come on, Jordan,
just pick up the phone.

1221
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,431
- Answer.
- Hi. This is...

1222
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:48,557
- Oh, puts the answering machine on.
- Okay, good, then hang up.

1223
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:53,031
Hi, Jordan. It's me. Just calling...

1224
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:55,992
to say happy New Year's
and to tell you that...

1225
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:58,958
I've really been thinking
about what you said...

1226
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,195
about how we needed to talk
about our plans.

1227
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:04,437
And yeah, we do need to talk.

1228
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:07,398
I just...

1229
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:10,193
I- I wanna talk.

1230
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:12,077
And, uh...

1231
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:17,796
if you get a chance,
uh, call me.

1232
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:20,991
Okay?

1233
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:25,716
And I really hope that
you have a happy New Year.

1234
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:27,916
Okay.

1235
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,909
Sorry.

1236
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:44,234
Is everybody ready?

1237
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:48,398
Uh, would you... Kate? Darling?

1238
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:50,311
- Here we go.
- With what?

1239
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,470
- It's almost time for the big moment.
- New Year's resolutions.

1240
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:54,835
- Okay.
- Another great Gulden family tradition.

1241
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:57,514
Can't dwell on the negative.
Gotta talk about all the great things...

1242
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:00,068
- that we're gonna accomplish next year.
- Ellen.

1243
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:03,197
- Please.
- Wouldn't it be a lot easier if we could just admit...

1244
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:06,192
to our failures,
the things that we fucked up on.

1245
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:08,840
- Ellen, would you not use that word in the house, please?
- Sorry.

1246
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:10,552
Used the "F" word.

1247
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:13,916
Failure isn't allowed
in the Gulden house.

1248
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,230
You know, maybe-maybe
we should break tradition this year.

1249
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:19,198
And since I've got a hell of
a good list of failures, I'll start.

1250
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:22,113
- I think it's not a good idea. - No, no.
Come on. Come on. - I don't think so either.

1251
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:24,230
- I'd like to. Yeah, I'd like to.
- You'd like to.

1252
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:26,709
Uh, lost my desk
at the magazine.

1253
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:29,598
Uh, really fucked up
the Sullivan interview.

1254
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:33,468
- I'm not gonna get that job back. And by the look of things...
- The Sullivan interview?

1255
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:35,795
- Have, uh, really ruined...
- What are you talking about? Why didn't you say something?

1256
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:38,792
My relationship
with my boyfriend, so...

1257
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:42,395
- There we go. Happy New Year.
- I failed my English class last semester...

1258
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:46,837
I'm on academic probation,
and I got kicked off the tennis team.

1259
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:48,751
- Happy New Year.
- Jesus Christ, Brian.

1260
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:51,513
- I could get a tutor. I could help you.
- What's this?

1261
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:53,989
Mom, I got a job at
the Cambridge Racquet Club.

1262
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:56,076
- Oh.
- And I don't wanna go back to school.

1263
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:59,948
You got a job? That's great.

1264
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:02,349
- Isn't it?
- Ten, nine, eight, seven...

1265
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:05,910
- You like it?
- Yeah, I love it.

1266
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,991
- That's wonderful. That's what you should do then.
- Six, five, four, three...

1267
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:12,198
- Good God, you only live once.
- Two, one... and we're into 1988!

1268
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:24,075
The holidays seemed to take
a lot out of my mother.

1269
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:28,153
It was right after New Year's when
her health really started to decline.

1270
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:30,879
And this guy in my class
was going on and on...

1271
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:33,838
about how selfish
she was and how...

1272
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:36,036
of course, she would leave.

1273
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:38,833
So my professor, who's a woman, said...

1274
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:41,150
"Anna Karenina would have left
her husband for her lover...

1275
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:43,395
"but would never
have left her son.

1276
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:47,194
And had Tolstoy been a woman,
he would've understood that."

1277
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:51,273
- What do you think of that?
- I haven't been reading Anna Karenina.

1278
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:53,914
No more whipping. That's enough.
Just drain the cherries.

1279
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,560
You have two hours
till Brian leaves.

1280
01:26:56,600 --> 01:27:00,070
You know I wanna have his pie
ready for him when he goes.

1281
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:01,997
I think the crust
is probably ready too.

1282
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:04,873
- You better check that.
- It should probably bake a little longer, but I can...

1283
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:07,554
I can't read anything anyway.

1284
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:09,591
My eyesight's gone
like an old lady. Let me see.

1285
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:15,915
- Uh, I don't think...
- Let me see. Let me...

1286
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,436
Goddamn it!
I hate this stupid chair.

1287
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:21,875
I hate it. I hate it.
I wish I could...

1288
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:26,317
just roll it down the street right
through Evelyn Best's front window.

1289
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:28,237
She pet me like a cat at Christmas.
Did you see that?

1290
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:31,630
Don't-Don't do that. Just leave it.
Get-Get another pie plate.

1291
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:34,393
There's another one
over in the left-hand cubby.

1292
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:36,471
Have time to make another.

1293
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:38,630
- Left, left-hand cubby.
- No, actually.

1294
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:43,794
I put them in here. And you know, Mom,
there's handicap access everywhere.

1295
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:45,711
I am not handicapped!

1296
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:48,439
- Oh, God, I'm not!
- What are you doing?

1297
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:50,795
- I am not an invalid!
- Stop that!

1298
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:53,912
I am not! I am not!
It's my house, you know.

1299
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,037
You can't tell me what to do.
I'm still a mother.

1300
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:01,199
Still a mother here.

1301
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:05,918
Mom, I know that.

1302
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:29,079
- Hello.
- Ellen, I'm going to be working late tonight.

1303
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:32,277
- Sorry I didn't make it home for supper.
- Mm-hmm.

1304
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:34,191
I'll get there as soon as I can.

1305
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:37,317
Yeah, I'm sure you will, Dad.

1306
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:40,750
- Who was that?
- It was your husband.

1307
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:44,549
Seems he's working late again.

1308
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:48,593
Well, it's a tough job
running that whole department.

1309
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:53,196
- Not that tough.
- Whatever you're doing, stop and come here.

1310
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:56,555
Right now!

1311
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:04,196
- Yeah?
- What has happened...

1312
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:07,596
- between you and your father?
- What do you mean?

1313
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:10,194
You've been so angry at him
ever since you came home.

1314
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:15,193
I don't know. I mean,
there's some stuff that...

1315
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:17,430
I mean, it doesn't have
anything to do with you.

1316
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:19,875
- Pretty soon he's all you'll have, you know.
- Please, Mom, stop.

1317
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:21,831
No.
You stop.

1318
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:23,757
He's gonna need you.
You're gonna need each other.

1319
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:27,349
My God, you used to be so close.
What... The two of you are so alike.

1320
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:30,989
- Please don't say that.
- Why?

1321
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:33,355
Because he's not perfect?
Because he's not the man...

1322
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:36,318
you thought he was?

1323
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:41,838
No, l... No, I can't...
I can't talk about this with you.

1324
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:44,639
- Come back here. Come on. I want you to sit down here.
- I can't.

1325
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:46,950
I want...
I want to talk to you. You sit there.

1326
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:55,676
Now you listen to me because
I'm only going to say this once...

1327
01:29:55,760 --> 01:30:00,197
and I probably
shouldn't say it at all.

1328
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:03,630
There is nothing that you know
about your father that I don't know.

1329
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:07,076
Nothing.

1330
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:09,509
And understand better.

1331
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:12,398
Okay?

1332
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:15,711
You make concessions
when you're married a long time...

1333
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:19,548
that you don't believe you'll make
when you're beginning.

1334
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:22,319
When you're young, you say,
"Oh, I'll never tolerate...

1335
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:24,590
this or that or the other thing."

1336
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:26,511
But time goes by, darling.

1337
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:29,194
And when you've slept together
a thousand nights...

1338
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:32,596
and you've smelled like spit-up
from the babies when they're sick...

1339
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:35,399
and you've seen your body
droop and get soft...

1340
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:39,228
and some nights you just think, "Oh, God,
I'm not gonna put up with it another minute."

1341
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:41,714
But you wake up
in the next morning...

1342
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:43,756
and the kitchen smells
like coffee...

1343
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:46,354
and the kids have their hair brushed
all by themselves...

1344
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:48,556
and you look at your husband,
and no...

1345
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:53,316
he's not the person
you thought he was.

1346
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:55,191
But he's your life.

1347
01:30:55,280 --> 01:31:00,400
And the kids and the house and everything
that you do is built around him.

1348
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:02,436
And that's your life.
That's your history too.

1349
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:06,314
And if you take him out, that's like
cutting his face out of all the pictures.

1350
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:11,554
It just makes a big hole
and it ruins everything.

1351
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:13,477
You can be hard, Ellen.

1352
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:17,231
And you can be very judgmental.

1353
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:20,392
And with those two things alone you're
gonna make such a mess out of your life...

1354
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:23,830
you wouldn't believe, and I wanna be able
to tell you these things in ten years.

1355
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:27,674
And when I think how most of what you
learned so far came from your dad...

1356
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:31,036
- it just hurts my heart to think how little...
- No. No.

1357
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:33,350
- I have gotten done.
- Mom, don't, um...

1358
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:35,356
- Yes, yes.
- Just, let's not talk about that. Can we...

1359
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:38,159
I wanna talk. You let me talk.
Now, look. Let me talk.

1360
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:41,038
You're dad won't let me talk
because he says I'll upset myself.

1361
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:43,588
And you won't let me talk.
"Oh, Mom, please don't talk."

1362
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:46,074
Brian's the only one that let's me talk.
He's never here.

1363
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:47,991
I wanna talk before I die.

1364
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:50,230
I do. I wanna be able
to say the things...

1365
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:53,517
- I wanna say the deep thoughts... without you shushing me...
- Okay. Okay. What?

1366
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:57,513
- Because what I say hurts you.
- Oh, Mom.

1367
01:31:57,560 --> 01:31:59,835
Tired of being shushed.

1368
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:02,957
What do you wanna say?

1369
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:08,839
I already said everything
I wanna say.

1370
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:11,269
Except I'm sad.

1371
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:19,752
- Why?
- I'm sad that I won't be able to plan your wedding.

1372
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,796
So promise me that you won't have
a ring bearer...

1373
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:24,400
or a flower girl, because those kids
always just misbehave...

1374
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:28,189
and then they distract
from the bride.

1375
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:30,470
And don't invite too many people.

1376
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:36,039
- Well, you know, I might not even get married, so...
- Whatever.

1377
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:41,758
If I knew that you would be happy,
I would close my eyes now.

1378
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:44,195
I would.

1379
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:46,708
It's so much easier
to be happy, my love.

1380
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:49,758
It's so much easier
to choose to love...

1381
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:52,877
the things that you have.

1382
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:54,871
And you have so much...

1383
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:57,918
instead of always yearning
for what you're missing...

1384
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:02,516
or what it is that
you're imagining you're missing.

1385
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:06,229
It is so much more peaceful.

1386
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:14,434
Thank you. That's very nice.
You're-You're too kind. Stay that way.

1387
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:18,871
You know what it is?
I found out today it takes six months...

1388
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,995
What time is it?

1389
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:31,112
I can't see the clock.
What time is it?

1390
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:35,239
- It's 11:35. Uh-uh.
- Did Harold call yet?

1391
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:40,715
Ellie, I need you to go get your father
and bring him home.

1392
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:42,955
Where?

1393
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:06,233
Can I get another beer?

1394
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:08,550
Okay. Yeah.

1395
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:34,158
Dad?

1396
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:43,356
Tsk. Who's that?

1397
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:53,631
Tsk. You weren't supposed
to see this.

1398
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:58,869
You shouldn't have, uh...

1399
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:06,036
I, uh... l...

1400
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:13,119
He didn't, uh... I mean,
he didn't even remember my book.

1401
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:17,198
Didn't even remember it.

1402
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:20,875
The narcissistic
son-of-a-bitch.

1403
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:23,428
Thinks just 'cause he teaches
at Harvard, right?

1404
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:30,156
He didn't even remember it.

1405
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:36,709
- Let's go home. Mom's waiting.
- Ellen...

1406
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:39,917
the first time
I saw your mother...

1407
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:46,313
she was so filled with light.

1408
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:52,355
She lit up everything
around her.

1409
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:59,997
Even me.

1410
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:08,717
I just can't imagine
the light going out.

1411
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:17,232
I can't imagine it.

1412
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:23,636
- I think it's time to go home. Come on.
- Let me get...

1413
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:29,076
Okay. Yeah.

1414
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:33,910
Okay.

1415
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:50,593
Harold?

1416
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:54,269
Ellen. L-l-
I was gonna bring him, but...

1417
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:56,709
I was just gonna call.

1418
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:59,593
Here. Let me. Let me.

1419
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:29,036
Ice-cream monster.

1420
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:31,913
- The ice-cream monster!
- The ice-cream monster!

1421
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:34,349
Good day.

1422
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:16,677
Your brother was back
at his new job in Cambridge...

1423
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:20,952
and your father was back
full time at the college.

1424
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:22,871
Right.

1425
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:26,839
So, you were responsible
for giving her her medicine?

1426
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:29,229
Yeah.

1427
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:41,949
Teresa! Teresa!

1428
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:46,115
Teresa!

1429
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:56,718
Mom! The nurse isn't here.
It's me. Are you okay?

1430
01:38:56,760 --> 01:38:59,149
- Oh, I'm fine.
- Well, do you need me to get you...

1431
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:01,515
I said I'm fine.

1432
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:16,550
I need you to help me.

1433
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:19,279
I can't get up.

1434
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:21,436
Oh, God!

1435
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:24,990
Okay.

1436
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:27,838
Okay, come on.

1437
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:30,673
Put your arm around me.
Up. Ready?

1438
01:39:30,760 --> 01:39:32,955
Ready?

1439
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:36,077
Okay, lift. Put your arm around me.
Put your arm around me.

1440
01:39:36,120 --> 01:39:38,315
Good.

1441
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:44,712
Good. Okay, good.
Here we go. Here we go.

1442
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:46,711
Okay.

1443
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:48,791
Okay.

1444
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:54,351
Okay.

1445
01:39:54,440 --> 01:39:56,271
I need a pill, Ellie.

1446
01:39:56,360 --> 01:40:00,831
It's not time yet. Can you wait?

1447
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:04,509
No.

1448
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:07,836
No. Please.

1449
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:19,475
Oh, I don't wanna live like this.

1450
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:26,834
Here.

1451
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:35,435
It'll be better tomorrow.

1452
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:42,953
No, I won't. This is not living.
This isn't living.

1453
01:40:46,680 --> 01:40:50,639
Why can't...
this be over, baby?

1454
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:54,593
Please help me.
You help me.

1455
01:40:54,640 --> 01:40:58,997
You're my girl. You help me, please.
Ellie, promise me...

1456
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:01,799
you'll help me.

1457
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:06,595
Please. Please. Please.

1458
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:10,315
We all made this
for you, honey.

1459
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:12,960
See, it's got our names
all over it, embroidered.

1460
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:17,033
- Oh, it's beautiful.
- I hope you like it.

1461
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:20,669
What's that smell? It's that
Indian summer potpourri, isn't it?

1462
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:23,792
Mm-hmm.
It's your favorite.

1463
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:26,633
Who's making
a racket out there?

1464
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:29,757
She brought the baby.

1465
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:33,515
You girls do good work,
you know?

1466
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:36,068
Are you available next Tuesday?

1467
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:39,118
- Oh, here he is.
- He says, "I want Kate."

1468
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:41,270
- Where's Kate? There she is.
- Oh, I thought I never...

1469
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:44,716
- Oh, hello, little man. Oh, my gosh.
- Can you sit down for me?

1470
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:48,719
Oh, gosh.
Who's that cute baby?

1471
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:56,235
Ellen, l...

1472
01:41:56,280 --> 01:41:59,670
I'm so sorry.
I know it must be very hard...

1473
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:03,469
for you seeing her like this.

1474
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:05,835
It's okay.

1475
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:09,390
It'll be over soon.

1476
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:13,793
I have a bib too.

1477
01:44:15,320 --> 01:44:17,834
I do remember telling Mrs. Best...

1478
01:44:17,880 --> 01:44:20,997
that it would all be over soon.

1479
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:23,076
But everyone knew that.

1480
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,594
Ellen...

1481
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:31,877
did your mother ever ask you
to help her out of her pain?

1482
01:44:31,960 --> 01:44:35,430
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I gave her
her medication every day.

1483
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:37,351
No.

1484
01:44:38,840 --> 01:44:41,877
Did your mother ever ask you...

1485
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:43,791
to help her take her life?

1486
01:44:48,120 --> 01:44:52,716
If she did, Ellen, I can say with
some assurance no one in this office...

1487
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:55,314
I did not help my mother
take her life.

1488
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:01,751
Where was your father
on that last night?

1489
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:06,078
He had a class.

1490
01:45:06,160 --> 01:45:08,958
He didn't come home
until she was already sleeping.

1491
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:18,274
- George.
- Yeah.

1492
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:20,754
- You came home so early.
- They cancelled my class.

1493
01:45:20,840 --> 01:45:25,038
Oh.

1494
01:45:30,680 --> 01:45:34,195
Hi, you pretty girl.

1495
01:45:34,280 --> 01:45:36,111
Did you miss me?

1496
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:39,431
Oh, no.

1497
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:47,119
I want to talk to George now.

1498
01:46:22,240 --> 01:46:25,232
Did you feed her?

1499
01:46:25,320 --> 01:46:28,995
No one should have
to live like that.

1500
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:30,917
No one.

1501
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:33,520
Mom said that.

1502
01:46:37,640 --> 01:46:39,710
She was right.

1503
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:16,077
Hey.

1504
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:23,158
I finished the table.

1505
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:43,073
Love you, Ellie.

1506
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:47,237
I love you.

1507
01:47:51,440 --> 01:47:53,317
I knew that.

1508
01:47:55,280 --> 01:47:58,795
I always knew that.

1509
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:42,190
Take care, sweetie.

1510
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:53,153
EI?

1511
01:49:53,200 --> 01:49:55,668
- Hey.
- Hi.

1512
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:01,271
Hi.

1513
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:04,631
I'm so sorry.

1514
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:10,396
I don't know what else to say.

1515
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:12,311
I'm so sorry.

1516
01:50:17,320 --> 01:50:19,390
How are you?

1517
01:50:19,440 --> 01:50:23,319
Yeah. You okay?

1518
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:26,233
Never knew I could
miss someone so much.

1519
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:28,151
Oh, God.

1520
01:50:28,240 --> 01:50:30,834
I know.
I missed you too.

1521
01:50:36,480 --> 01:50:39,074
I know this isn't really
a good time to talk, but...

1522
01:50:39,120 --> 01:50:41,270
you know, when you're ready,
we should...

1523
01:50:41,360 --> 01:50:43,828
we should figure out what we're
going to do this year, you know.

1524
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:47,117
- Don't you think?
- You know, Jordan, a lot has happened...

1525
01:50:47,160 --> 01:50:49,037
that you just don't understand.

1526
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:52,436
And I'm sorry, but I don't think
you can understand.

1527
01:50:52,520 --> 01:50:54,351
What? What are you
talking about?

1528
01:50:54,440 --> 01:50:57,238
- Thank you for coming.
- EI?

1529
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:10,790
Ellen...

1530
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:15,470
your mother died
of an overdose of morphine.

1531
01:52:15,560 --> 01:52:17,790
Can you think of any possible
explanation for that?

1532
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:25,995
Do you think your father might have
some idea how it might have happened?

1533
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:29,117
I really don't know
how he could.

1534
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:31,760
Like I said, he didn't come home
until she was sleeping.

1535
01:52:34,280 --> 01:52:36,111
Have you discussed any of this
with your father?

1536
01:52:36,200 --> 01:52:38,031
No.

1537
01:52:38,120 --> 01:52:41,510
Well, only because I went back
to New York right after the funeral.

1538
01:52:41,560 --> 01:52:43,551
And I really haven't talked
to him since then.

1539
01:52:43,600 --> 01:52:46,797
I've been really busy.
New job.

1540
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:49,751
- You're writing again?
- Mm-hmm.

1541
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:52,479
Feature writer for the Voice.

1542
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:56,075
Hmph.
Congratulations.

1543
01:52:56,160 --> 01:52:57,991
Thanks.

1544
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:02,831
I may want to speak to your father.

1545
01:53:06,480 --> 01:53:08,596
Anyway...

1546
01:53:08,680 --> 01:53:10,716
thank you.

1547
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:12,631
Sure.

1548
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:20,631
I'm sorry for your loss.

1549
01:53:20,720 --> 01:53:22,551
Thank you.

1550
01:54:03,640 --> 01:54:06,029
How long have you been here?

1551
01:54:06,120 --> 01:54:09,999
Not long.

1552
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:14,272
I can smell the lilacs
and the hollyhocks under the soil.

1553
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:21,035
Your mother used to say
she could do the same thing.

1554
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:25,797
How'd it go today?

1555
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:28,274
All right, I guess.

1556
01:54:28,360 --> 01:54:30,316
He's gonna want
to talk to you too.

1557
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:36,633
Ellen, I just want you to know
how much I admire your courage.

1558
01:54:37,960 --> 01:54:42,476
And I wish I'd done it.

1559
01:54:42,520 --> 01:54:44,954
What?

1560
01:54:45,040 --> 01:54:46,996
I wish I had.

1561
01:54:50,640 --> 01:54:52,517
I would've.

1562
01:54:55,760 --> 01:54:57,637
Couldn't.

1563
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:07,837
Dad, I didn't do it.

1564
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:11,629
I didn't do it.
I thought that...

1565
01:55:11,720 --> 01:55:14,996
All this time,
I thought that it was you.

1566
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:24,236
- Oh, my God.
- No.

1567
01:55:24,320 --> 01:55:26,834
- It's impossible.
- Oh, my God.

1568
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:29,150
She was too helpless.
She was too frail.

1569
01:55:38,040 --> 01:55:39,917
The pills.

1570
01:55:39,960 --> 01:55:42,076
How could sh...? Jesus.

1571
01:55:48,680 --> 01:55:52,389
Ellen, l...

1572
01:55:52,440 --> 01:55:54,476
I love your mother.

1573
01:56:04,520 --> 01:56:07,876
I don't suppose
I'm ever going to stop loving her.

1574
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:16,236
But because she can do anything...

1575
01:56:16,280 --> 01:56:18,748
run the house, run our lives...

1576
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:22,031
keep everything
so beautiful and so warm...

1577
01:56:28,840 --> 01:56:31,912
I only thought
of what she meant to me.

1578
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:36,869
My... muse.

1579
01:56:36,920 --> 01:56:39,992
My... lovely wife.

1580
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,230
My one true thing.

1581
01:56:48,920 --> 01:56:51,878
Of course she did it.

1582
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:53,831
Who else would've had
the strength?

1583
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:24,673
No, you have to go
deeper than that.

1584
01:57:24,720 --> 01:57:28,952
You have to go four inches.

1585
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:32,589
- Four?
- Yeah.

1586
01:57:32,680 --> 01:57:36,070
Yeah, so that they don't rot in the snow,
or so that the animals don't get them.

1587
01:57:36,160 --> 01:57:37,991
Uh-huh.

1588
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:42,232
And then four inches apart
so that the roots don't tangle...

1589
01:57:42,320 --> 01:57:44,880
and they'll just
look prettier.

1590
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:50,675
What are these plants?

1591
01:57:50,760 --> 01:57:52,591
Daffodils.

1592
01:57:52,680 --> 01:57:55,797
- These are daffodils?
- Yeah.
