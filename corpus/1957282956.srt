1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,780
(bright music)

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,490
(whistles)

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,020
(country music)

4
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,340
(dramatic music)

5
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,420
(country music)

6
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,970
(growls)

7
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,960
(rumbles)

8
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:04,330
(exciting music)

9
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,810
(horse whinnies)

10
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,370
(plucks violin)

11
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,870
- So, tuning your violin again, Papa.

12
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,840
Just in case ask me to play

13
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,680
at the cheese festival today, Mama.

14
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,910
- (laughs) You'll play Papa, whether they ask you to or not.

15
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,370
(laughs)

16
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,910
- That cheesecake smells fantastic, Mama.

17
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,930
You'll win the blue ribbon for sure.

18
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,050
- Not if there's a piece missing I won't.

19
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,850
- Oh, that's not right.

20
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,770
(gurgles)

21
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,850
How will I ever get ready,

22
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:11,470
was supposed to be watching the baby?

23
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:16,290
- He was, now where has that boy disappeared to this time?

24
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,960
- He quietly approached the savage beast

25
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,090
then prepared to make his move.

26
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:25,900
The Lonesome Ranger spied the wildcat up ahead.

27
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,460
There's the wildcat now.

28
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,160
(growls)

29
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,190
Yeehaw!

30
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,800
(growls)

31
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,330
I'll tame you yet, you ornery critter!

32
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,950
(growls)

33
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,080
(screams)

34
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,890
(shouts)

35
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:13,000
- Do hurry Chula, my arm is getting tired.

36
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:17,360
m almost there boss, just a little lower.

37
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,010
(whines)

38
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,550
(shouts)

39
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,290
- [Homeowner] Ah, a spider!

40
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,570
(growls)

41
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,240
(moans)

42
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,500
- Well, what have we here?

43
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,540
- Uh-oh.

44
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,630
- I was looking forward to a roast chicken dinner

45
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,590
for a Mouseling canape instead.

46
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,340
(gulps)

47
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,160
(moans)

48
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,920
come back here you rodent.

49
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,030
That was a close one.

50
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:03,030
- Forgive me Fievel, I didn't recognize you.

51
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,570
Now come out and we'll shake hands

52
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:10,020
and make up like gentlemen.

53
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:18,400
- Chula quick, our lunch is right under your feet.

54
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,550
(moans)

55
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,550
- Gotcha!

56
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,140
(laughs evilly)

57
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,360
(coughs)

58
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,850
The traffic in this town is intolerable.

59
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,650
Now, where were we!

60
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,030
(shouts)

61
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,080
- Whoa!

62
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,150
- Come back I say.

63
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:50,100
(action music)

64
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,770
(laughs)

65
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:56,230
- Who did that?

66
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,830
- [Sidekicks] Yeah, who did that?

67
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,270
(clatters)

68
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,270
- Howdy, partner.

69
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,800
(moans)

70
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:36,410
- Fievel, where have you been?

71
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,060
(pants)

72
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,940
- Hmm, most intriguing, now I see where I can locate lunch

73
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,870
at my convenience.

74
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,360
This is (shouts)

75
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,620
- I thought I told you to stay out of our alley, Wall?

76
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,840
- Yeah. - That's right.

77
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,000
- Now, you've gone and interrupted my meal.

78
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,930
And I hate when that happens.

79
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,870
- Yeah, he hates when that happens.

80
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,070
- Shut up, Slim.

81
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,900
- Yeah, shut up, right chief.

82
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:11,120
- Why, Sweet William, and his delightful alley cat friends.

83
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,180
I was just looking for you gentlemen.

84
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,230
- It seems that we have a problem in common,

85
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,300
namely, proper nourishment and how to obtain it

86
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,140
with the least amount of effort.

87
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,210
It just so happens I have a plan.

88
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,480
- Sorry I'm late, buckaroo.

89
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,190
But I was busy roping me a wildcat.

90
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,260
But instead you were out daydreaming again.

91
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,340
- But Papa, I was just,

92
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,670
- Someday Fievel, your imagination is going

93
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,690
to get you into serious trouble.

94
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:51,050
- Yes, Papa.

95
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,100
- Come on everybody, the wagon is here

96
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,040
to take us to the cheese festival.

97
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,310
(playful music)

98
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,820
- G'day mates.

99
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,090
(sniffs)

100
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,620
Smells like a mighty tasty cheesecake

101
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:18,970
- And how is the Smythe family today, Glynis?

102
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,800
- As we used to say in Australia Mr M,

103
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,890
- G'day Fievel, how's about we ride the wheel?

104
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:29,010
- Oh boy, can I Papa, can I?

105
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:32,900
- I suppose so Fievel, as long as you keep an eye on Yasha.

106
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,190
-Oh.

107
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,000
(laughs)

108
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,440
Gosh, I forgot my Lonesome Ran er Lariat.

109
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,650
I gotta go back and get it.

110
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,460
- [Driver] Giddy up.

111
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,420
(horse neighs)

112
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,230
Don't worry Yasha, I'll catch up.

113
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,490
(moans)

114
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,860
Got it, whoa!

115
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,400
(clangs)

116
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,570
Help, I'm trapped!

117
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,890
- Fievel, bye bye.

118
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,840
(dramatic music)

119
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,360
- Help, I'm trapped in here.

120
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,900
can anybody hear me

121
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:41,900
- Gentlemen I assure you, your money will be well spent.

122
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,230
My mouse tasting tour of Green River

123
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,800
will be remembered as one of the splendid moments,

124
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,940
in culinary history .

125
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,840
- What are you trying to say, Wall?

126
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:57,600
- I mean, we'll be eating mice til we drop.

127
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,930
- Then what are we waiting for?

128
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,830
- Ah, after you, gentlemen.

129
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,350
- Gentlemen, thanks boss.

130
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,830
- [Wall] Not you, bug face.

131
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,340
- What did I do, what did I do?

132
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,830
- Is anybody out there?

133
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:14,970
Please help me.

134
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,890
Papa help, I'm in here, hey, what's going on,

135
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,950
- Fievel, buddy, where is everyone?

136
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,540
On vacation, or what?

137
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,910
The town’s deserted, the humans are gone.

138
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,350
- The whole town went to the cheese festival

139
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,040
at Harvest Meadow.

140
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,810
And I missed the wagon.

141
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,910
- You mean you’re home alone?

142
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,790
- Don't you see, Tiger, I was supposed to look after Yasha.

143
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,860
And now I've let Papa down, again.

144
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,890
- Hey, no problem, let's go find 'em, come on, Fief.

145
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:55,150
(laughs)

146
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,400
Which way to Harvest Meadow?

147
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,750
- You know what they say, when the mice are away

148
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,680
the cats will play.

149
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,630
town to ourselves,

150
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:13,050
hey, lets play a game of cat and mouse.

151
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,710
(laughs)

152
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:19,090
- One one thousand, two one thousand.

153
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,700
- Okay okay, where can I hide?

154
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:28,360
It's got to be a place he'll never think of looking.

155
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:33,980
Oh, ha ha, that's it, he'll never find me there, (laughs)

156
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,020
(moans)

157
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:42,050
I take that back, bad, bad idea.

158
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,460
I'm stuck.

159
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,380
- [Sweet William] All right, what you doing down there?

160
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,420
- Wow, Fievel, that's amazing,

161
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,890
you sound just like Sweet William.

162
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,310
Hey, hi, I mean howdy fellas.

163
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:04,420
- All right pal, we came here to eat some mice,

164
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,070
what did you do with 'em?

165
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:10,870
- Mice, there's no mice around here, Mouseless.

166
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,860
(shouts)

167
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:15,060
oh no, they've got tiger

168
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,840
(bright music)

169
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,630
- Yasha, where's your brother?

170
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,910
(gurgles)

171
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,810
Fievel, where are you?

172
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,030
- Jack here says he saw Fievel run back into the house

173
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:45,370
- Oh, that means we left him back in Green River.

174
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:48,420
And the wagon won't be returning until dusk!

175
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,360
- Fievel.

176
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,840
- Ah, don't you fret, we'll find another way to get back.

177
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,870
- It's not fair, Papa, while we worry about Fievel,

178
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:59,450
he's probably out playing with that silly Tiger.

179
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:04,070
- No, no, oh no, please, you're killing me, ah stop.

180
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,270
please, (laughs) i can't, wooho

181
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,970
oh please, oh please, oh tell him to stop

182
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,910
- All right you mouse in a yellow bellied cat suit.

183
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,980
I'm a give you one more chance,

184
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,860
where are the mice?

185
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,910
I already told ya, they're not here.

186
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,480
They all left town for a picnic.

187
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:30,360
- Oh, so the mice are all gone huh?

188
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,910
If you’ve crossed me Catterwall,

189
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,380
they'll find bits of your fur scatted

190
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,360
from here to Boot Hill.

191
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,810
(laughs)

192
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,350
- Oh, tut, tut, tut, gentlemen.

193
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,360
This is becoming tiresome,

194
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,350
this pathetic excuse for a feline

195
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,850
is obviously prevaricating.

196
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:55,850
that's right

197
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,370
And he's lying too.

198
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:01,990
- There are mice here and I can prove it.

199
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,180
what would the lonesome ranger do?

200
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,290
what would the Lonesome Ranger do?

201
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:14,400
(chomps) (dramatic music)

202
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,180
A good cowboy always has his lasso handy.

203
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,500
(growls)

204
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,540
(moans)

205
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,650
(barks)

206
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:43,510
Uh-oh.

207
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,760
Whoa!

208
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,560
- Oof, oh.

209
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:53,520
Gentlemen, I rest my case, I said there were mice

210
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,960
in Green River and here is my proof.

211
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:01,730
- Oh, that's not proof, that's Fievel.

212
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:04,380
- No, that’s supper.

213
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:08,460
(laughs) (cheers)

214
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:17,810
(laughs evilly)

215
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,210
- Give up you bushwhackers,

216
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:25,820
my men have this place surrounded.

217
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,330
(laughs evilly)

218
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,270
- Indeed.

219
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:35,360
Then why not just open the door and invite them in.

220
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,900
(growls) (gasps)

221
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,530
(barks)

222
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:41,270
(shouts)

223
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,250
(yells)

224
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,850
(groans)

225
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,610
(plops)

226
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,950
- [Wall] Get off, get off me.

227
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,170
(squeaks)

228
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,020
(yells)

229
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:12,000
- Fievel, you saved the day, what a guy!

230
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:15,330
- Yeah, but if I know Catterwall, those cats'll tear

231
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,220
So we leave town too, right?

232
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,490
- Wrong, the Lonesome Ranger doesn’t run

233
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,500
for trouble, partner

234
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,900
It's time to take a stand.

235
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,950
- You sure this thing is seaworthy, Cyrus?

236
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,590
- I'd bet a wallaby' widget on it.

237
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:39,130
With a canoe like this we could hunt crocs in the outback.

238
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,570
- Pappy, bye bye.

239
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,660
(dramatic music)

240
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:50,530
- Well, where was I before we were so rudely interrupted.

241
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:51,980
(snaps) Ah es.

242
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:55,140
- I'm tired of your puss footing Catterwall.

243
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:59,670
All this running around has made me powerful hungry.

244
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,500
We spread out, (mumbles)

245
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,510
oh yeah, yeah, so we can surround 'em.

246
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,010
- [Minions] Great idea chief.

247
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,960
- All right.

248
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,960
Let's get 'em.

249
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,070
(laughs)

250
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,640
- No Chula,

251
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,290
(yawns)

252
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,440
run along and terrify some mice if you must,

253
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:33,140
even ingest one or three but I must catch a brief cat nap.

254
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,960
over my dead body, wall

255
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:41,040
You took our money and now you’re gonna earn it or else.

256
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,960
- On second thought, I do love the thrill of the chase.

257
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,200
(shouts)

258
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,160
(tense music)

259
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,480
- Okay, tiger, lower away

260
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:12,030
Make your move, pole cat.

261
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,520
Let's go, I'm talking to you fur head.

262
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,280
(laughs)

263
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:32,580
- That’s two down and let me see, three take away four

264
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,280
is seven, no, no, no, wait, wait, what am I doing?

265
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,480
maths is my worst subject

266
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,900
(dramatic music)

267
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,990
- Go in and flesh him out, Wall, and then I'll put him

268
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,470
out of our misery.

269
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,120
(yells)

270
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,990
- I loathe this running around as much as you do, Fievel.

271
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:15,240
Hmm, I assure you if you give up

272
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,210
I'll make it quick and painless.

273
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,060
- I'm not finished with you yet, hombre.

274
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,180
- That is that last straw!

275
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,680
(bangs)

276
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,470
I'll have that nap now!

277
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,480
(plops)

278
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,190
- You good for nothing tin horn,

279
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,250
guess I'll have to handle this one myself.

280
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:51,970
When I get my hands on you mice,

281
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,430
I'm gonna, (groans)

282
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,450
Hey, cat.

283
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,790
You want a mouse to munch.

284
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:04,050
keep it up tiger

285
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:08,120
- How bout picking on one your own size!

286
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,660
- Yeah, well, you’re one big rodent.

287
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:15,150
- I knew you was yella.

288
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,770
- With a mouse your size I'll be snacking for a week.

289
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:26,470
- Tiger, we've got a problem.

290
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:30,180
- We've got a problem, you double dealing,

291
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:34,200
oh, Fievel, run for it.

292
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,480
(dramatic music)

293
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,460
- Why you!

294
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,450
(yells)

295
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,120
(grunts)

296
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:54,550
- I've got you now, cheese eater.

297
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,420
(laughs evilly)

298
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:02,490
yeah, now I getcha, (laughs evilly) yeah.

299
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,880
(shouts)

300
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,280
(poofs)

301
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:19,590
(laughs)

302
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,570
(sneezes)

303
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,400
(playful music)

304
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,560
(moans)

305
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,400
(splashes)

306
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,860
- [Wall] You oaf!

307
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:57,020
Go away, go back to your.

308
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,120
(shouts)

309
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:03,140
(yowls)

310
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,580
(meows)

311
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,000
(squeals)

312
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,150
(spits)

313
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:16,960
- That's mud in your eye, partner.

314
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,480
- You forgot about me, little furball.

315
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:28,440
Now it’s dinner time.

316
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,450
(groans)

317
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,640
- Hey Fievel, come here quick.

318
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,000
- Doesn't anybody knock anymore?

319
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,560
- Papa.

320
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:47,330
(laughs)

321
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:51,040
Fievel, you worried your mother sick, what happened to you?

322
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,140
- I thought I had time to go back inside

323
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,000
and get my Lonesome Ranger lariat,

324
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,480
but I'm sorry I let you down, Papa.

325
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,770
- Well, the important thing is that you’re okay.

326
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,530
We were afraid the cats would get you.

327
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,380
- The cats?

328
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,000
Let me tell you pilgrim, they came outta nowhere,

329
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,010
five of 'em, it was a brutal battle

330
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:16,060
but when the smoke cleared he town was saved.

331
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:16,950
(claps)

332
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,620
And me and my trusty sidekick

333
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,730
were the only two left standing.

334
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:22,480
(laughs)

335
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
- Oh Fievel, such a tall tale,

336
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,470
what am I ever going to do with you?

337
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:40,280
(country music)
