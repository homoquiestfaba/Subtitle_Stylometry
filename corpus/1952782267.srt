1
00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:05,664
Ow! Hey, hey!

2
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:07,730
- Keep still.
- Hey, come on.

3
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:11,210
Try a little
sensitivity here.

4
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:14,441
Too bad you're not a horse,
we could shoot you.

5
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:18,184
All right,
let's get going.

6
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:20,880
Hello, Raymond.
Your father's ruined everything.

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,683
What?
What happened to you?

8
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:24,622
I was bringing
the suitcases down.

9
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:26,454
The bum knee
popped out again.

10
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,723
You're so clumsy.

11
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:31,663
That's the thanks I get for blowing
my knee out in Korea

12
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,531
making the world safe
for your mother.

13
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:38,803
You told me you slipped off
a massage table in Tokyo.

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,070
Nevertheless.

15
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:44,770
What about the cruise now?

16
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:47,279
Okay.
Well, thanks.

17
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:51,181
Mom and Dad are screwed.

18
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,617
Can't reschedule, and we can't
get our money back.

19
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:55,086
Why not?

20
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:57,885
Because the discount package
you made us get them

21
00:00:57,924 --> 00:01:00,188
does not permit changes.

22
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:03,889
Oh, we can't go.
You happy now, Tiny Tim?

23
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:08,230
- I'll go, I'll go.
- No, no.

24
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:10,600
I'll go.
I'm going.

25
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:12,434
No, Dad!

26
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:14,463
Ma, you could go
by yourself.

27
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:16,532
Call one of your friends.
Call Lee.

28
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,567
Lee can't go.
Stan's cousin,

29
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:21,409
the diabetic,
is visiting from Arizona.

30
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:23,177
You could always go
by yourself.

31
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:26,276
- No.
- Yes. We got it for your birthday.

32
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,415
I know, dear. And for once
you got us a very nice gift.

33
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,749
Come on, Ma,
you never do anything like this.

34
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:36,557
You bought all
that cruisewear, huh?

35
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,121
Where you gonna wear that?
Around the tub?

36
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:42,191
Not for me.
I couldn't bear to go alone.

37
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:45,534
Ma, this is a deluxe
weekend cruise in Bermuda.

38
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:49,201
This is once in a lifetime.
This is non-refundable.

39
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,940
I'm sorry. It was a lovely
gesture really.

40
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,073
And we want to pay you back
for the whole thing.

41
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,744
Hey!

42
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:02,516
No, Ma, you wanna go.
I want you to go. Come on.

43
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:04,853
What's it gonna take
to get you just go?

44
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,882
I don't know.

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,299
No. Ma, look...
Debra would never let me do that.

46
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:21,000
Now that would be
a real present.

47
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,975
Ma, I would love
to go but...

48
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:27,036
that wouldn't be
fair to Robert.

49
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,015
No, no.
I don't mind.

50
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:33,815
I think it's fair.
In fact, it's more than fair.

51
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:36,344
It's funny.

52
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:39,756
Then, Robert, you can stay home
and take care of your father.

53
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:44,927
Also funny.

54
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:47,865
Oh, Raymond!

55
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,802
This day started
out so good.

56
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,836
Wow, did you
do that yourself?

57
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,410
They're coming!

58
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:50,857
Oh, look how cute this is.

59
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:55,157
This is the deluxe
package?

60
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:58,295
All right, look.
I want to get mad

61
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,898
but I don't think I can fit
another emotion in here.

62
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,008
Oh.

63
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:07,308
I'm gonna bring Debra back
one of these shower-caps

64
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,838
to thank her for letting
me have you for the weekend.

65
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:13,784
Yeah, the one thing
she lets me do.

66
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:19,181
Oh, look how adorable
this little toilet is.

67
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:22,285
Oh, that's great.
They stuff you full of food

68
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:24,728
then they give you
baby's first potty.

69
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:28,925
Come on, let's just get
the hell out of here.

70
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:30,765
- Single file!
- No, no, no.

71
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:33,101
We're gonna have
a wonderful time.

72
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:35,539
Yeah?
How do you figure?

73
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:37,634
Well, for one thing,
we're gonna spend

74
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:40,339
the whole weekend together.

75
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,109
We can talk.

76
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:45,276
You and me,
just talk.

77
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:55,125
Oh, Raymond, thank you
for this lovely trip.

78
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:57,493
Knock, knock.
Oh, hi.

79
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,430
Welcome
to the Star Princess.

80
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,524
I'm your social
director, Ted.

81
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:05,298
Just a list of some of the super
activities we've got going on.

82
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:07,772
Oh God, activities.

83
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,674
Whoo, I've always wanted
to do shuffleboard.

84
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,235
And bingo
and candlemaking.

85
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,679
Oh good.
Skeet shooting.

86
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:17,910
I'd like to sign up
as skeet.

87
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:28,022
This... this is our
first trip.

88
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:30,894
Oh, well then, sir,

89
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,057
may I recommend
the deck by moonlight?

90
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:35,693
You and your lady
might enjoy the gorgeous...

91
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,101
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Lady? Whoa!

92
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:40,765
This is not my lady, okay?
This is my mother.

93
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:43,367
Oh, sure, sure, sure.

94
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,969
Mother. Done.

95
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,106
She really is my mother.
Tell him you're my mother.

96
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:51,810
Oh, honey, look.
Origami!

97
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,581
What did you write there?
I'm telling you the truth.

98
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,611
It doesn't really matter.
We're at sea.

99
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,715
You have a grand time,
you two.

100
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,267
Lunch!

101
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,998
It's about time.
I'm starved.

102
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,029
What?

103
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,575
You...
you're not limping.

104
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:25,050
Oh yeah.
Uh...

105
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:27,075
It's a miracle.

106
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,689
- Dad?
- Honest.

107
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,055
I was watching one
of those religious channels.

108
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:36,687
I pledged five bucks.
Praise the Lord!

109
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,829
You faker!

110
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:44,837
The moaning and groaning
and flopping on the couch.

111
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,998
Pretty good, huh?

112
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,441
What kind of a person
are you?

113
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:52,671
I'm a very smart person.

114
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:55,704
Marie will be much better
off without me anyway.

115
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,876
And what are you complaining about?
You're free to go.

116
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,012
Everybody gets
what they want.

117
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,620
I guess.

118
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,995
Everybody except Raymond.

119
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,033
God bless
that magnificent bastard!

120
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,162
Let's eat!

121
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:22,436
Now this is what
I call a vacation.

122
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:25,672
Three days of sitting
in front of the Tv eating,

123
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:29,408
napping on the couch, soaking in
my new hot tub. Nobody nagging at me...

124
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,917
"Frank, take out
the trash. "

125
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,419
"Frank, cover your mouth
when you burp. "

126
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:38,115
"Frank, that's no place
for a Q-tip. "

127
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:43,723
I'm free!

128
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:46,357
I'm footloose
and fancy-free!

129
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:49,061
Oh, oh, oh.

130
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,434
Come on,
you've got the part!

131
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,566
I'm not kidding.
I really popped it this time.

132
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:58,202
- You did not.
- I did too.

133
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:02,908
Let me see.

134
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:06,211
You just had to dance.

135
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:22,398
Oh, there you are.
Where have you been?

136
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:25,797
Bar hopping.

137
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:31,341
Waffle bar,
omelet bar,

138
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:33,868
tostada bar.

139
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:36,643
Now I'm doing clam shots.

140
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,382
Raymond, so many clams.

141
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,148
You should try
the crab cakes.

142
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,055
- Had 'em.
- And the little eclairs...

143
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,889
Had 'em!

144
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,895
I'm amazed at how much
I can get done

145
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,897
in the morning
without your father.

146
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:55,230
I played bridge, I jazzercised.
And look, origami.

147
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:59,136
Mr. Sasa thinks I have
natural talent.

148
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,332
- What's this made out of?
- Paper.

149
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,103
Oh!

150
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,748
And tomorrow we're
making lotus blossoms.

151
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,545
You should come.

152
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,484
No, I don't know, Ma.

153
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,783
Some scuttlebutt
about a pie buffet.

154
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:19,116
And bingo starts at 4:00.

155
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:22,423
Oh, see, but I'm hanging
myself at 3:00.

156
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:27,694
Come on, it'll be fun. At least you
can sit with me for a little while.

157
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,167
- Nah.
- Marie, Marie.

158
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:33,797
- Here's me in my wedding dress.
- Isn't that beautiful?

159
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,637
Dear, this is Mary Beth
from jazzercise.

160
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:39,645
I'm Ray from Lynbrook.

161
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,613
Mary Beth's
on her honeymoon.

162
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:44,616
We've been working
on our glutes.

163
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,675
To glute work!

164
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,885
You know,
your mother's wonderful.

165
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,256
- Yeah?
- Oh yes.

166
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:57,751
She gave me some great advice on how
to have a long and happy marriage.

167
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,594
Really?

168
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,896
Long and happy?

169
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,926
Yes. She says
it's important to remember

170
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,997
you're not just his lover,
you're his best friend.

171
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:14,646
She's so smart.
Thank you, Marie.

172
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,375
Oh, anytime,
sweetheart.

173
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:18,849
And I'll see you
at Tai Chi, okay?

174
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:23,587
You told her you and Dad
were best friends?

175
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:27,320
I also told her that childbirth
isn't that painful.

176
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,055
She's on her honeymoon.

177
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,723
She's got the rest of her life
to be disappointed.

178
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,699
- Okay, smile, you two!
- Oh!

179
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:37,100
That's a keeper, yes.

180
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,536
We put these on display
on the Lido deck.

181
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:42,200
I think you put that one
on the poop-deck.

182
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,002
So, uh...

183
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,912
what are you and Mom
up to this afternoon?

184
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:52,907
You know, she really
is my mother.

185
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:56,820
I wanted to play bingo,
but I'm not sure Raymond is up for it.

186
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:58,983
You know, several
of our cruisers have told me

187
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,493
they would love to share
a bingo card with you, Marie.

188
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:03,654
That is if Raymond
doesn't mind.

189
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:07,530
Well, why would I mind?
She's my mother!

190
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:12,232
Well then, fantastic.
We'll set it right up.

191
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:19,206
- Oh hi, Walter!
- Marie, how are you, my dear?

192
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:21,338
- This must be Raymond.
- Hey.

193
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,747
Hello. I got to know your mother
this morning over bridge.

194
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:27,810
Nimble.
Nimble mind.

195
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,980
Of course I don't have
to tell you that.

196
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:33,583
Oh, Walter, stop.

197
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:36,823
Yes, Walter.
Stop.

198
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,592
Marie, I'd be honored
if you'd be my partner tomorrow.

199
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,327
- Oh, it's a date.
- Great!

200
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,768
Your mother is one
terrific lady!

201
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:49,432
Marie! We're ready to practice.
Can you please?

202
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:51,136
They're from "The Best
of Broadway. "

203
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:53,543
Oh, girls, we'll be
better than Broadway.

204
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:56,309
Raymond, you have to come
to the cabaret tonight.

205
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:58,942
You know,
life is a cabaret.

206
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:04,221
Oh, don't mind us.
We're a bunch of merry widows.

207
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:06,781
- Right, Marie.
- That's us.

208
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:11,494
I'll see you later.

209
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,792
Merry widows?

210
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:16,063
Yes, all their husbands
are dead.

211
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,595
But you're not a widow.

212
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,980
& How can I be
what I ain't? &

213
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,849
& I can't &

214
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:37,913
& Say no. &

215
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:52,664
Thanks.

216
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:55,265
I appreciate your help.

217
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:58,799
I know there's a lot of other things
you'd rather be doing.

218
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:01,142
That's okay, Dad,
I understand.

219
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,343
The important thing
is we got you there in time.

220
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,286
Damn calzone.

221
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:15,987
Robert?
You're not going to believe this.

222
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:18,394
What? Again?

223
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,796
All right, come on.

224
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,301
- Hurry.
- Okay.

225
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:27,028
Grab the newspaper.

226
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,005
Oh yeah.

227
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:53,610
Ring a bell and the whole world
comes running.

228
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:57,144
I'm done. Help me
out of this thing.

229
00:15:57,189 --> 00:16:00,590
I got your macaroni
and cheese on the stove.

230
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,753
I gotta stir it,

231
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,526
'cause you like your cheese
evenly distributed.

232
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,134
Now, please.

233
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,036
That's it.

234
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,041
What are you doing?
What's the big idea?

235
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:18,009
I'll get you out
when I'm good and ready.

236
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:21,171
- I'm ready now.
- But I'm not.

237
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:24,671
I am the father.
You are the son.

238
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:28,676
The son must serve
the father.

239
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,212
Oh yeah?
You want to be served?

240
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:33,417
All right,
I'll serve you.

241
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:35,723
But first,
I'm gonna cook you.

242
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:38,059
What are you doing?

243
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,656
Robert.

244
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:59,410
Oops.

245
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:02,386
I didn't think
you'd be up.

246
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:06,323
Do you have any idea
how late it is?

247
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:12,257
I don't know, but who cares?
We're at sea.

248
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:15,494
- Where have you been?
- With my friends.

249
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,502
We sang "Carousel"

250
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,800
and practically all
of "Fiddler on the Roof. "

251
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:22,068
I was Tevye.

252
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:24,371
Friends who?
Those merry widows?

253
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:27,208
Uh-huh, and Ted
and Walter

254
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:28,975
and Mary Beth's husband.

255
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:30,743
We're all going
to the discotheque.

256
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:35,282
What did I do
with my evening purse?

257
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,015
Oh yeah.

258
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:40,716
Have you been drinking?

259
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,590
No, but upstairs

260
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:45,028
they're setting up
a whiskey-sour fountain.

261
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:51,062
Who are you?

262
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,230
What do you mean?

263
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:56,469
You're acting all,
I don't know,

264
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,999
like a woo-woo
party girl.

265
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:02,806
I'm having fun.
Can't I have fun?

266
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:06,306
I'm not saying you can't.
I'm just saying it's a little...

267
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:09,115
hard to watch.

268
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:12,021
I didn't know you were
paying any attention.

269
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:15,390
You seemed so busy trying
to get on all the buffet lines.

270
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:18,755
Gotta get there early
or they get picked over.

271
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:21,163
Stop eating.

272
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,432
Stop eating? See, you've never
said that to me before.

273
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,200
Come on,
let's go dancing.

274
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:30,436
No, no, I don't wanna dance.
I'm not a dancer.

275
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,808
All right then,
I'll see you later.

276
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:36,246
Wait, Ma. Don't you think
you're overdoing it a little?

277
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,273
Huh? Take it easy.
Take a break.

278
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,616
Come on, we'll get
something to eat here.

279
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:44,349
Look, room service.
I've got a tab running.

280
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:48,554
I don't wanna stay in the room.
It's too small.

281
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:50,858
What's so special about
those people out there?

282
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:53,763
Nothing. They're just very nice.
They think I'm fun.

283
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,929
They think I'm interesting. They like
doing things with me. They like me.

284
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,437
I like you.

285
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:03,874
Oh, I know you do,
Raymond.

286
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:08,278
You know what? We'll have room service
for breakfast tomorrow.

287
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,304
I won't stay out long.

288
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,340
- But, Mom.
- What?

289
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,219
Maybe I'll...

290
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:19,349
I don't know.

291
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:22,327
I'll go with you.

292
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,826
No, that's all right,
dear, you don't have to.

293
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:27,627
No.

294
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,725
I want to.

295
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:31,668
You want to go dancing?

296
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:33,637
I don't know about that,

297
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,731
but we can hang.

298
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:40,276
Don't be silly.
We'll foxtrot.

299
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:42,780
- I don't know how to do that.
- Yes you do.

300
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:44,975
You remember your
cousin Gene's wedding?

301
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,679
- I was 13.
- But you were very good.

302
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:49,550
All right, just...
follow me now.

303
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,681
It's step-step,
quick step.

304
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:55,557
- Count with me. Step-step, quickstep.
- Step-step, quickstep.

305
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:59,291
Step-step, quickstep.
I got it.

306
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:02,266
- See, Raymond. You're marvelous.
- Okay.

307
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,195
No!

308
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:23,317
Sure could go
for some pretzels.

309
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,885
I'll get them.

310
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,397
& Da da dum. &

311
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,631
Hi, boys!
We're home!

312
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:43,266
Marie!
My Marie!

313
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:46,072
What are you doing up?
You shouldn't be up. Sit down.

314
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,579
I missed you so much.

315
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:52,042
Sit down. Sit.

316
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:56,149
Oh, poor Chi-Chi,

317
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:57,655
Did you miss me?

318
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:00,214
It's been hell
without you.

319
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:03,194
Did Robby take
good care of you?

320
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:06,197
Oh yeah, I took care of him
all right.

321
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:09,626
He should be tender
to the bone.

322
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,932
Thank you, Robby dear.

323
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,066
- Hey.
- Hey.

324
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,076
How was your trip?

325
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,773
Yeah, not bad.
I'll tell you one thing,

326
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:24,907
if Dad's the first to go,
Mom is gonna do just fine.

327
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,887
Oh yeah? Well, if Ma's
the first to go

328
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:32,355
God help us all.

329
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,087
Hey, hold on.
I made this for you.

330
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,654
- Yeah, it's...
- Oh.

331
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:41,689
- Yeah, it's Oriental.
- Good.

332
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:45,503
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

333
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:47,630
Putting on a few pounds,
there, huh, cubby?

334
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:49,664
Yeah, yeah.
