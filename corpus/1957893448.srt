- What are you doing?

- Let go.

Now I feel bad.

177

[Waiter] Excuse me.
Your card didn't work.

00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:36,484
- Do you have another one, maybe?
- Can you try it again, please?

181
00:14:36,527 --> 00:14:39,704
- [Waiter] I tried it twice.

- I'm sorry, we don't accept that one.
- [Carl] Just take this one.

Carl! Just give me a second.
Just wait!

- Yes.

I do think it's quite crazy how
it's such a hard thing to talk about.

It's such a touchy subject.
Don't you think?

Yeah, I think it's un-sexy

I don't know, it's just not
sexy.

199
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,224
Well, you don't think it's because
it's so tied to gender roles?

200
00:16:49,095 --> 00:16:52,663
Fuckin' hell, the menu in the
restaurant didn't even have prices for you.

201
00:16:52,707 --> 00:16:54,752
That's not fair, Carl.

202

- I'm always paying.
- No, no, no, let's take you out of it here.

You don't understand what I'm
trying to say. I mean...

212
00:17:30,962 --> 00:17:33,530
We shouldn't just slip into the
stereotypical gender-based roles

doing.

The thing is, Yaya, I like to take
you for dinner. I enjoy paying for you.

where I do feel used.

feelings now, but sure, if we...

No, no. Just wait. If we go back
the last week or so,

to pay you back.

money right now before going to bed.

- Yes.

- Yeah.

the 50-euro bill?

Once I realized you didn't have
enough cash, I paid the bill.

240

00:38:57,247 --> 00:38:59,206
We're from Great Britain.

506
00:39:12,785 --> 00:39:15,657

00:39:23,535 --> 00:39:26,712
[Uli] Hello. This is my wife,
Therese.

510
00:39:26,755 --> 00:39:30,237
She understands you perfectly,
but my wife had a stroke.

511
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,632
Since then, she's suffering
from a disability of speaking.

[Clementine] In den Wol...?

515
00:39:52,259 --> 00:39:54,174
- Wolken.
- Wo...

516
00:39:54,217 --> 00:39:56,045
- Champagne, sir?
- No, thank you.

517
00:39:56,089 --> 00:39:59,397
- What does it mean?
- [Uli] "Up in the clouds."

518
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,399
Oh! How beautiful.

519
00:40:08,971 --> 00:40:11,060
- Bye, girls.
- Bye.

520
00:40:11,104 --> 00:40:12,497
Take care.

521
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:19,373
[Mario] Nice to meet you, my
friend. I hope I work with you again.

522
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,419
[Man] It was a pleasure, Mario.

523
00:40:23,116 --> 00:40:25,161
- We're going to miss you.
- Miss you already.

524
00:40:25,205 --> 00:40:27,207
- Take care.
- Take care, you.

[♪ MODJO:

528
00:41:07,203 --> 00:41:08,988
Look at that.

529
00:41:11,381 --> 00:41:13,122
Sad, huh?

530
00:41:16,865 --> 00:41:18,780
He's hunting.

531
00:41:18,824 --> 00:41:21,043
- [Carl] Huh?
- He's hunting!

532
00:41:22,784 --> 00:41:24,264
Big dilemma.

533
00:41:25,395 --> 00:41:28,616
Should he take risk,
or go to the room, huh?

534
00:41:32,272 --> 00:41:33,534
Come on.

535
00:41:36,885 --> 00:41:38,583
Look, look!

536
00:41:38,626 --> 00:41:41,499

538
00:42:05,348 --> 00:42:07,002
Amazing...

539
00:42:10,266 --> 00:42:11,659
Wow.

540
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,534
Sorry if I'm interrupting.

541
00:42:16,577 --> 00:42:19,319
Er... could you just do me a
favor?

542
00:42:20,581 --> 00:42:23,149
I have this girl,
who should be here with me,

543
00:42:23,192 --> 00:42:26,021
but couldn't come and...

544
00:42:26,065 --> 00:42:29,068
...I would like to take a
picture. Please.

545
00:42:30,243 --> 00:42:33,115
- Can you take my picture?
- Oh, yeah, of course.

546
00:42:34,813 --> 00:42:36,641
I'll stand over here.

547
00:42:38,077 --> 00:42:39,818
Oh! Sorry, sorry!

548
00:42:49,871 --> 00:42:51,438
Good?

- Thank you very much.
- [Yaya] A pleasure...

550
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,487
- Have a nice evening.
- [Yaya] Yeah, you, too.

551
00:43:02,536 --> 00:43:04,582
Excuse me? Mister?

552
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:09,151
Hi! Eh...
Can you please come back?

553
00:43:11,806 --> 00:43:13,808
You can leave your beer, it's
okay.

554
00:43:13,852 --> 00:43:16,463
- What?
- You can leave your beer.

555
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,773
- If you come in the middle...
- Yeah?

556
00:43:21,816 --> 00:43:23,862
Then we can take a picture
together, the three of us.

[Man] Thank you very much!
You're very generous!

I would like to do something
generous to you.

They have Rolex watches
in the reception.

565

We can go down there now, and I
will buy you Rolex watches!

It may sound strange, but I'm...

What you just did here,
it meant so much to me.

So I can...

I'm very rich.

571
00:44:03,423 --> 00:44:06,948
Yes, let's not beat around the
bush. I'm very rich.

572
00:44:06,992 --> 00:44:08,863
- How rich are you?
- Oh, I'm so...

573
00:44:08,907 --> 00:44:12,824
I'm so fucking rich!
I just sold my company.

574
00:44:12,867 --> 00:44:16,958
[Captain] Yeah, I'm not drunk! I
told you, I'm not feeling well.

575
00:44:17,002 --> 00:44:20,788
- [Door opens]
- Do you have problem with that?

576
00:44:20,832 --> 00:44:23,138
Can't you respect that?

577
00:44:23,182 --> 00:44:25,010
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

578
00:44:25,053 --> 00:44:27,621
- Good evening, madam.
- Good evening.

579

Paula?

00:44:35,585 --> 00:44:37,762
- Thomas?
- What is it?

581
00:44:37,805 --> 00:44:43,202
I just want to ask you when you're
able to hold the Captain's Dinner?

582
00:44:43,245 --> 00:44:45,987
Oh, for fuck's sake...

583
00:44:46,031 --> 00:44:49,469
- I can't do the Captain's Dinner now!
- No, I'm asking you a question, Thomas.

584
00:44:49,512 --> 00:44:53,778
When are you able to put on your
uniform and be there for the guests?

585
00:44:54,604 --> 00:45:00,001
Oh... Okay.
Well, what's the forecast?

586
00:45:00,045 --> 00:45:03,439
The weather's fine, Thomas.
It's about when you can do it.

587
00:45:04,353 --> 00:45:06,486
Any day but Thursday.

588
00:45:06,529 --> 00:45:09,707
- Thurs... Thursday's good.
- No. Thomas.

589
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:11,447
- Thursday's bad.
- Huh?

590

We have a low-pressure zone
moving in. Any day but Thursday.

591
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:17,889
- Yes, Thursday! Okay!
- Okay, Thomas, listen.

592
00:45:17,932 --> 00:45:19,847
I'll come back and talk to you
about this later.

593
00:45:19,891 --> 00:45:23,285
Paula! Every day, they eat
dinner.

594
00:45:23,329 --> 00:45:28,160
And they're going to eat dinner
Thursday as well. Right?

595
00:45:28,203 --> 00:45:31,990
Your most expensive champagne,
and three glasses.

596
00:45:32,033 --> 00:45:34,079
- Is this your boyfriends?
- [Both] Yeah.

Guys, you take care of these
girls now!

598

They're really, really nice
girls! Generous. Caring.

You treat them right, you know!

600
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:49,268
You think they want some
champagne?

601
00:45:49,311 --> 00:45:51,966
Okay, five glasses!
Five glasses.

- [Yaya] What if I go?

606
00:46:14,597 --> 00:46:16,643
- Come on, dance with me!
- No, no...

607
00:46:16,686 --> 00:46:18,688
Come on! Just a little bit.

608
00:46:19,907 --> 00:46:22,954
- No, I'm... I'm so...
- Come on. Don't be shy!

609
00:46:22,997 --> 00:46:24,782
- No...
- Why? I'm dancing.

610
00:46:24,825 --> 00:46:28,481
- No... I never dance.
- Come on, dance with me.

611
00:46:28,524 --> 00:46:29,874
- I just don't.
- Why not?

612
00:46:29,917 --> 00:46:33,051
- I don't like it.
- Okay.

613

- Alright, it's okay. Whatever...

- What?

620

00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:54,436
Sorry about coming into the mansion,
I just needed to get some tools.

624
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,090
[Yaya] Oh?

625
00:48:00,529 --> 00:48:02,444
Over here...

626
00:48:05,491 --> 00:48:08,146
It's very inappropriate.

627

[Carl clears throat]

628
00:48:11,279 --> 00:48:12,890
What if my, er...

629
00:48:14,587 --> 00:48:16,110
...husband comes home?

630
00:48:16,154 --> 00:48:17,895
Where is your husband?

631
00:48:17,938 --> 00:48:21,289
He really shouldn't be leaving
such a beautiful girl on her own.

632
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:24,118
Because it's very dangerous
around here.

633
00:48:24,162 --> 00:48:25,598
[Giggling]

634
00:48:27,774 --> 00:48:29,950
- He's working.
- Oh...

635
00:48:31,038 --> 00:48:33,258
- Always working...
- Is he?

636
00:48:33,301 --> 00:48:35,956
Yeah.
It's hot, huh?

637
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,263
- Yeah, I'm very hot.
- You should take that off.

638
00:48:38,306 --> 00:48:41,135
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Ooh.

639
00:48:42,006 --> 00:48:43,442
Ooh!

640
00:48:47,794 --> 00:48:52,059
The thing is, your husband pays
me a lot of money, you see.

641
00:48:52,103 --> 00:48:57,412
So, I do have to just make sure
I'm doing my job properly.

642
00:48:57,456 --> 00:48:59,719
- Okay?
- You check the pipes.

643
00:48:59,762 --> 00:49:01,547
Yeah, is there any...

644
00:49:02,287 --> 00:49:04,942
...is there any down here
that need to be...

645
00:49:06,465 --> 00:49:10,512
...unblocked, or...
is everything okay?

646
00:49:13,907 --> 00:49:15,996
You're sure you're the right guy
for the job?

647
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,912
I am, I am. I'm very qualified.

648
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:21,088
Hmm... Let me see.

649
00:49:28,617 --> 00:49:30,445
[Camera shutter clicking]

650
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:54,948
[Woman] Do you know what
people regret on their deathbed?

651
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,602
Can you turn the phone?

652
00:49:56,645 --> 00:49:58,256
- [Steward] No.
- [Woman] No?

653
00:49:58,299 --> 00:50:01,476
That they were working too much,
seven out of ten people regret

654
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:05,785
throwing away their lives
on stupid and pointless jobs.

655
00:50:07,091 --> 00:50:11,356
- Can I get you anything to drink?
- [Woman] More champagne, please.

656
00:50:11,399 --> 00:50:15,969
I don't know, I was just born
into this life. It was not my fault.

657
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:20,713
And when this happened, I... I
just felt like, "Why? Why?"

658
00:50:20,756 --> 00:50:24,151
- Life is so unfair.
- Yeah.

659
00:50:24,195 --> 00:50:26,806
We are all equal.

660
00:50:26,849 --> 00:50:29,678
- That is so true.
- Everyone's equal.

661
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:41,864
Is there anything you wish for?

662
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:47,653
- Sorry?
- Is there anything you... wish for?

663
00:50:48,915 --> 00:50:51,961
Well... Well, I don't know.

664
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:56,879
That's so sweet of you, madam,
but I'm perfectly fine.

665
00:50:56,923 --> 00:51:01,971
But, but, but, but if today
was your last day alive...

666
00:51:03,321 --> 00:51:07,281
- ...hmm... what would you wish for?
- I have no idea.

667
00:51:08,717 --> 00:51:12,721
- Have you been for a swim today?
- No, not today.

668
00:51:13,635 --> 00:51:16,986
Why don't you go for a swim
right now?

669
00:51:19,293 --> 00:51:22,296
Because this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

670
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:25,908
That's so kind of you, madam,
but unfortunately we're not allowed

671
00:51:25,952 --> 00:51:28,824
to go for a swim
during working hours, so...

672
00:51:28,868 --> 00:51:31,436
I want all the staff to go for a
swim!

673
00:51:31,479 --> 00:51:34,613
I want you all to go for a swim!

674
00:51:34,656 --> 00:51:39,835
I really feel that I've had
one of these moments.

675
00:51:39,879 --> 00:51:43,970
Yeah, well, today might be
a little bit problematic...

676
00:51:44,013 --> 00:51:45,276
Problematic?

677
00:51:45,319 --> 00:51:47,147
Cos today we have
the Captain's Dinner.

678
00:51:47,191 --> 00:51:51,456
Who cares about the Captain's
Dinner? This will only take half an hour.

679
00:51:51,499 --> 00:51:53,458
Come on, now.

680
00:51:53,501 --> 00:51:55,764
You work too hard, come on.

681
00:51:57,201 --> 00:52:00,682
- Yeah, well, let me see what I can do.
- Merci!

682
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:14,174
No, no, no! Come back!
Come back, please.

683
00:52:14,218 --> 00:52:17,786
Please come back.
I have a better idea.

684
00:52:18,657 --> 00:52:20,659
- Sit down.
- Okay.

685
00:52:22,226 --> 00:52:25,185
Let's reverse roles.

686
00:52:25,229 --> 00:52:28,406
- Sorry?
- Just change roles.

687
00:52:30,234 --> 00:52:34,586
You... chillax in the jacuzzi,
and I'll get the captain.

688
00:52:34,629 --> 00:52:36,153
Oh... well...

689
00:52:36,196 --> 00:52:40,113
Come on! Just be in the moment,
like I was. Please!

690
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:42,594
- Yeah, but...
- Come, come, I know you want to.

691
00:52:42,637 --> 00:52:44,900
- Come on!
- Yes, I do but...

692
00:52:44,944 --> 00:52:47,120
But there might be
a problem for me, if I...

693
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:50,036
Now I have to be the authority.

694
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:52,778
- Yeah, well, I have my clothes on...
- Shut up, shut up, shut up!

695
00:52:52,821 --> 00:52:54,388
Shut up! Now!

696
00:52:56,564 --> 00:53:00,177
I command you, enjoy the moment!

697
00:53:03,354 --> 00:53:05,704
- N-now?
- Please.

698
00:53:10,448 --> 00:53:12,101
- No.
- No?

699
00:53:12,145 --> 00:53:14,060
- No.
- What?

700
00:53:15,148 --> 00:53:17,019
- You say "no" to me?
- No. No!

701
00:53:17,063 --> 00:53:18,717
- So it's "yes"?
- Yes... No.

702
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:21,198
- "Yes" or "no"?
- I'm saying...

703
00:53:22,416 --> 00:53:24,288
Sorry, I'm saying, n...

704
00:53:25,114 --> 00:53:26,420
I'm saying...

705
00:53:27,465 --> 00:53:31,033
- Yes.
- Yes! Ha-ha!

706
00:53:31,077 --> 00:53:34,254
Don't worry.
Dimitrios will buy the yacht.

707
00:53:34,298 --> 00:53:36,387
Come on! Sit down, sit down.

708
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:39,520
- Okay, I'm going in.
- Quick, quick, quick... Yes!

709
00:53:40,739 --> 00:53:42,175
[She speaks French]

710
00:53:45,309 --> 00:53:47,093
- This wonderful Miss...
- Alicia.

711
00:53:58,278 --> 00:54:00,933
[Paula] Darius? I need your
help.

712
00:54:00,976 --> 00:54:05,067
I need you tell one of the guests
that the crew can't go for a swim.

713
00:54:05,111 --> 00:54:06,634
Why?

714
00:54:06,678 --> 00:54:08,636
Well, I told them it's not
possible because of the dinner,

715
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:11,596
but they want to hear it
from the captain in person.

716
00:54:11,639 --> 00:54:14,338
So I went to Thomas' cabin,
I knocked on it, he's not there.

717
00:54:14,381 --> 00:54:17,166
He's not responding.
I can't get a hold of him, so...

718
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:19,343
Could you just please go and
tell them it's not possible?

719
00:54:19,386 --> 00:54:22,607
- That would be a big help.
- Can't you just go for a swim?

720
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:24,913
No. I mean,
that would be the easiest,

721
00:54:24,957 --> 00:54:27,873
but they want us to go
from the water slide and...

722
00:54:27,916 --> 00:54:31,093
It's not even funny.
Why are you laughing, Erik?

723
00:54:31,137 --> 00:54:33,487
- Why are you even here?
- I'm on my break.

724
00:54:33,531 --> 00:54:36,273
Well, your break is over.
Go back to work.

725
00:54:36,316 --> 00:54:39,885
It's not even installed yet, it will
take forever, and I don't have that time.

726
00:54:39,928 --> 00:54:42,975
The chef has started the dinner,
I need the prep-time.

727
00:54:43,018 --> 00:54:44,846
So please go and tell them
it's not possible...

728
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:47,240
I'm not going to go and talk
to some crazy Russians.

729
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:49,677
It's not crazy Russians,
it's very rich Russians.

730
00:54:49,721 --> 00:54:50,939
Same thing.

731
00:54:50,983 --> 00:54:53,072
Go and solve this problem first,
and then...

732
00:54:53,115 --> 00:54:55,509
No! We're done.

733
00:54:55,553 --> 00:54:59,600
- Why won't you do this?
- Go and take a swim. Jesus...

734
00:54:59,644 --> 00:55:01,385
- Hello, sir!
- Hello.

735
00:55:01,428 --> 00:55:05,171
- Can I help you?
- I was just looking.

736
00:55:05,214 --> 00:55:07,347
- You want to see the bridge?
- If possible.

737
00:55:07,391 --> 00:55:11,308
Of course. I can get the First Officer.
He's not doing anything right now.

738
00:55:12,352 --> 00:55:14,789
- Could you show the guest the bridge?
- Yes, of course.

739
00:55:14,833 --> 00:55:16,661
Welcome to the bridge.

740
00:55:16,704 --> 00:55:19,838
I'm Darius. Nice to meet you.

741
00:55:32,546 --> 00:55:33,982
Thomas?

742
00:55:37,725 --> 00:55:39,336
Thomas? Hello?

743
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:48,910
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

744
00:55:48,954 --> 00:55:54,089
- Actually... I have a question.
- Yes, of course.

745
00:55:54,133 --> 00:55:57,354
Yesterday, I was up on the
sundeck.

746
00:55:57,397 --> 00:56:00,444
And the sun was shining,
everything was perfect.

747
00:56:00,487 --> 00:56:02,837
But then I looked at the sails.

748
00:56:02,881 --> 00:56:04,796
- The sails?
- Yes.

749
00:56:04,839 --> 00:56:07,451
And they were... a bit dirty.

750
00:56:07,494 --> 00:56:09,844
- Oh!
- Yeah.

751
00:56:09,888 --> 00:56:11,716

Hi.

755
00:56:26,513 --> 00:56:30,517
Yeah, but do you realize the
food down here is going to be bad?

756
00:56:32,171 --> 00:56:33,477
Okay, bye.

757
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:37,394
Okay, guys, listen up.
You are going to swim.

758
00:56:37,437 --> 00:56:40,135
So, bring your swimming pants,
and go to the main deck

759
00:56:40,179 --> 00:56:42,573
as quick as possible, okay?

760
00:56:42,616 --> 00:56:46,751
Come on! Chop, chop!
You're going to water slide.

761

one of the Russians.

Yeah. And they were dirt-gray.

843
01:02:13,468 --> 01:02:15,732
Do you think it's possible
to wash them?

844
01:02:15,775 --> 01:02:19,779
Well, I don't think that's
possible, ma'am, because, er...

845
01:02:19,823 --> 01:02:23,174
- ...this is a motorized vessel.
- Yeah.

846
01:02:23,217 --> 01:02:25,611

we will clean the sails.

I create code for apps.
So you can program...

872

better to eat something,

In T-shirt and shorts?

1204
01:29:11,215 --> 01:29:15,001
No, no, it's because, er...
I was off duty.

1205
01:29:16,829 --> 01:29:19,266
I was sleeping, and then...

1206
01:29:19,310 --> 01:29:21,834
- You were off duty, yeah?
- Yeah.

1207
01:29:23,009 --> 01:29:26,491

I'm sorry, I've never seen you
before.

- He works in the engine room?
- It doesn't matter where he works.

1212
01:29:36,545 --> 01:29:40,505
Settle down now.
Stay calm in this situation.

1213
01:29:40,549 --> 01:29:43,203
I'm calm, I'm calm. What's the
problem with you, man?

No one else?

1215
01:29:45,075 --> 01:29:46,772
You think I'm a pirate?

Are you okay?

1217
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:51,821
Just because I'm black, you
think that I'm a pirate. That's it!

1218
01:29:51,864 --> 01:29:53,953

shoulder!

says I'm a pirate just because I'm black!

What's the problem with you,
man?

1223
01:30:04,137 --> 01:30:06,270
[Paula] He hasn't said anything
about you being black.

1224
01:30:06,313 --> 01:30:11,101
- You're calling him a racist.
- In the eyes, I can see it in his eyes...

1225
01:30:11,144 --> 01:30:13,538
- [Dimitry] Who are you? Who are you?
- [Paula] Sir!

- [Paula] Excuse me.

1228
01:30:19,022 --> 01:30:21,285
I think you should just calm
down now.

1229
01:30:21,328 --> 01:30:23,896
It's not a good time
to step up the situation.

1230
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:26,943
- Just stay calm and stay positive.
- [Dimitry] He works in the engine room?

1231
01:30:26,986 --> 01:30:30,599
[Paula] There's a lot of people on the
boat. We can't see each other all the time.

1232
01:30:30,642 --> 01:30:34,733
- [Man] So what's the problem?
- [Paula] Please don't go there.

1233
01:30:34,777 --> 01:30:36,605
I'm sorry. I just have to get
that.

1234
01:30:38,128 --> 01:30:41,000
- [Man] Just say what you have to say.
- [Dimitry] Stop.

1235
01:30:41,044 --> 01:30:42,741
[Man] Say it to me.

1236
01:30:42,785 --> 01:30:45,135
[Paula] Yes, I know.
I'll get back to you. I know.

But you can drink it,
it's just water in a can.

1298

Crazy.

Good job! What is that? An
octopus?

- [Abigail] Octopus.
- Good!

1309
01:37:54,085 --> 01:37:57,175

Yes...

1312
01:38:05,227 --> 01:38:08,143
Do any of you know
how to make a fire?

1313
01:38:08,186 --> 01:38:09,405
What?

- What?
- No!

1317
01:38:22,505 --> 01:38:25,247
Then you'll make the fire after you're
done fishing, and then we should...

1318
01:38:25,290 --> 01:38:28,554
- [Abigail] We need to clean the octopus.
- Of course we do.

1319

For you.
For me.

1338
01:39:37,275 --> 01:39:39,538

01:39:45,675 --> 01:39:47,590
That's mine.

1341
01:39:47,633 --> 01:39:49,722
No, the big pile there?
What's that?

01:39:52,160 --> 01:39:55,119
- All of this?
- Yes.

1344
01:39:56,120 --> 01:40:00,081
No. No, no, no...
Why do you get so much food?

1345
01:40:01,865 --> 01:40:03,040
Why?

1346
01:40:05,129 --> 01:40:07,001
[Sighs heavily]

1347
01:40:07,044 --> 01:40:08,915
I caught the fish.

1348
01:40:09,655 --> 01:40:11,831
- Yes?
- I made the fire.

1349
01:40:11,875 --> 01:40:13,746
- And?
- I cooked.

1350
01:40:13,790 --> 01:40:17,837
I did all the work.
And everybody got something.

1351
01:40:20,884 --> 01:40:22,190
Hmm...

1352
01:40:23,104 --> 01:40:26,324
No. No, we all... we all worked.

1353
01:40:26,368 --> 01:40:28,500
What did you do?

1354
01:40:29,501 --> 01:40:33,114
We... gathered all the wood
for the fire.

1355
01:40:33,157 --> 01:40:35,768
- [Abigail snorts]
- I moved the log.

1356
01:40:35,812 --> 01:40:39,337
Yeah, this big log was over
there, and we moved it over here.

1357
01:40:39,381 --> 01:40:41,035
Not enough.

1358
01:40:42,210 --> 01:40:45,430
[Paula] No, maybe not enough,
but we need to work together.

1359
01:40:45,474 --> 01:40:49,565
- They don't know how to do that.
- Exactly.

1360
01:40:51,436 --> 01:40:55,440
And maybe that's why you should
not be so lazy and dependent on me.

1361
01:40:55,484 --> 01:40:58,182
- [Dimitry mutters and chuckles]
- Uh-huh!

1362
01:41:17,245 --> 01:41:20,857
Abigail...
I think you're forgetting

1363
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:24,600
that you and I are employees
of a big shipping company.

1364
01:41:24,643 --> 01:41:26,515
Remember?

1365
01:41:26,558 --> 01:41:30,127
In the end, I'm responsible
for the safety of the guests.

1366
01:41:30,171 --> 01:41:32,086
You have to do what I say.

1367
01:41:33,174 --> 01:41:36,873
We work on a yacht.
You are a toilet manager.

1368
01:41:36,916 --> 01:41:39,745
- You don't know how to handle...
- What yacht?

1369
01:41:39,789 --> 01:41:41,878
- [Dimitry laughs]
- Where's the yacht?

1370
01:41:41,921 --> 01:41:44,968
You know this, Abigail,
I am a very rich man.

1371
01:41:45,011 --> 01:41:48,624
When we get back,
I can do good things for you.

1372
01:41:48,667 --> 01:41:51,105
I can make your life easy and
nice.

1373
01:41:51,148 --> 01:41:53,585
- [Abigail] When we get back?
- Yeah.

1374
01:41:53,629 --> 01:41:55,935
When we get back.
People are looking for us.

1375
01:41:55,979 --> 01:41:59,069
What, you think that
we'll stay here forever? What?

1376
01:41:59,113 --> 01:42:01,811
[Abigail laughs] You're funny.

1377
01:42:01,854 --> 01:42:05,206
This is not how you were
trained, Abigail. Please give...

1378
01:42:05,249 --> 01:42:07,295
[Dimitry] Whoa!

1379
01:42:09,601 --> 01:42:12,082
[Paula] Come on, this is
ridiculous.

1380
01:42:13,736 --> 01:42:16,956
You're scaring people.
Put the stick down.

1381
01:42:18,219 --> 01:42:19,698
[Dimitry] Hey!

1382
01:42:24,921 --> 01:42:26,531
Who am I?

1383
01:42:27,967 --> 01:42:30,448
- [Paula] Who are you?
- Who am I?

1384
01:42:30,492 --> 01:42:34,713
- You're the toilet manager.
- No.

1385
01:42:34,757 --> 01:42:39,327
On the yacht, toilet manager.
Here... captain. Who am I?

1386
01:42:43,548 --> 01:42:45,550
You're the captain.

1387
01:42:47,291 --> 01:42:48,466
Yes.

1388
01:42:51,513 --> 01:42:54,168
- Who am I?
- Captain.

1389
01:42:54,211 --> 01:42:57,214
- [Abigail] Very good. Cutie pie?
- Captain.

1390
01:42:58,128 --> 01:43:00,565
- Who am I?
- Captain.

1391
01:43:00,609 --> 01:43:02,437
- Who am I?
- The captain.

1392
01:43:03,307 --> 01:43:05,440
- Who am I?
- [Mutters]

1393
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:10,706
Who am I?

1394
01:43:12,925 --> 01:43:14,536
Who am I?

1395
01:43:23,980 --> 01:43:26,983
In the yacht, cleaning lady.
Here, captain.

1396
01:43:27,940 --> 01:43:29,333
Okay?

1397
01:43:32,467 --> 01:43:33,772
[Dimitry chuckles]

1398
01:43:43,608 --> 01:43:45,654
[Abigail] Have one more.

1399
01:43:45,697 --> 01:43:47,133
Thank you.

1400
01:43:48,265 --> 01:43:50,311
[Dimitry] I would say, I agree.

1401
01:43:50,354 --> 01:43:54,184
I mean, er...
we have to work together.

1402
01:43:55,272 --> 01:43:58,710
And... create a good group.

1403
01:43:58,754 --> 01:44:00,321
Good society.

1404
01:44:00,364 --> 01:44:02,975
Do you know the saying,

1405
01:44:03,019 --> 01:44:06,327
"From each according to his
ability,

1406
01:44:06,370 --> 01:44:09,243
"to each according to his
needs"?

1407
01:44:12,289 --> 01:44:14,378
You don't know this?

1408
01:44:15,597 --> 01:44:17,251
Ma'am Paula...

1409
01:44:20,210 --> 01:44:25,607
With respect to your expertise
in this situation...

1410
01:44:27,304 --> 01:44:31,003
...I would like to make a
suggestion, if that's okay?

1411
01:44:32,396 --> 01:44:33,832
Sure.

1412
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:39,403
My suggestion is that
the boys...

1413
01:44:40,796 --> 01:44:45,670
stay here and watch the fire,
and take care of madame.

1414
01:44:45,714 --> 01:44:51,285
While you, ma'am Paula, and you
sleep with me in the lifeboat.

1415
01:44:55,637 --> 01:44:57,291
[Animal barks]

1416
01:45:01,686 --> 01:45:03,209
[Barking]

1417
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:07,213
[Closer barking]

1418
01:45:18,486 --> 01:45:19,835
Thank you.

1419
01:45:25,362 --> 01:45:26,842
[Knocking]

1420
01:45:26,885 --> 01:45:29,192
[Dimitry] Hey, Abigail, look
this...

1421
01:45:30,193 --> 01:45:32,500
[Jarmo] I would give you
my Patek Philippe.

1422
01:45:32,543 --> 01:45:35,024
[Dimitry] For one night in the
boat. Hey, Abigail...

1423
01:45:35,067 --> 01:45:37,505
- [Jarmo] 150 thousand euros!
- [Abigail laughs]

1424
01:45:38,723 --> 01:45:42,597
- [Jarmo] Let us in.
- [Dimitry] For you... original Rolex.

1425
01:45:49,517 --> 01:45:53,042
Nelson... she left the bag.

1426
01:45:53,999 --> 01:45:56,306
- What?
- She left the bag.

1427
01:45:59,527 --> 01:46:01,790
[Nelson] What's in it?

1428
01:46:12,453 --> 01:46:14,629
[Carl] Pretzel sticks.

1429
01:46:19,416 --> 01:46:23,464
- No, we can't have it.
- I'm just gonna have a look. Alright?

1430
01:46:29,383 --> 01:46:32,516
- Nice!
- [Carl] We can't. No.

1431
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:34,257
[Zips up bag]

1432
01:46:40,568 --> 01:46:42,308
- Wait...
- What are you doing?

1433
01:46:42,352 --> 01:46:43,788
Wait, wait, wait...

1434
01:46:50,534 --> 01:46:51,970
Maybe...

1435
01:46:54,930 --> 01:46:57,628
...if we just make a little hole
here...

1436
01:46:58,499 --> 01:47:03,852
Take two out. One each.
They'll never notice it.

1437
01:47:03,895 --> 01:47:05,810
[Carl] Okay, let me try.

1438
01:47:09,553 --> 01:47:11,816
- Stop it, stop it, stop it...
- Now?

1439
01:47:24,525 --> 01:47:26,570
That was perfect!

1440
01:47:29,051 --> 01:47:32,184
- I don't wanna eat it! I wanna save it!
- [Nelson] So good!

1441
01:47:34,230 --> 01:47:35,971
[Carl] Put it back.

1442
01:47:53,075 --> 01:47:54,380
[Carl] Hmm...

1443
01:48:00,778 --> 01:48:03,085
- Shall we just have one more?
- Yeah.

1444
01:48:03,128 --> 01:48:04,347
Yeah!

1445
01:48:16,228 --> 01:48:17,621
Vera!

1446
01:48:22,887 --> 01:48:24,323
[Weeping]

1447
01:48:54,571 --> 01:48:56,617
[Crow cawing]

1448
01:49:22,381 --> 01:49:24,688
So, what happened here?

1449
01:49:24,732 --> 01:49:27,517
Er... we made a mistake with...

1450
01:49:29,171 --> 01:49:31,129
[Abigail] Why?

1451
01:49:31,173 --> 01:49:33,305
We just fell asleep.

1452
01:49:33,349 --> 01:49:37,614
Now I won't have enough time to go
fish, because I have to make another fire.

1453
01:49:39,050 --> 01:49:42,010
It takes a lot of work
to make a fire, you know.

1454
01:49:42,053 --> 01:49:43,794
Yeah, yeah. We know.

1455
01:49:47,668 --> 01:49:49,670
[Inaudible whispering]

1456
01:49:56,285 --> 01:49:57,460
[Sighs]

1457
01:50:00,332 --> 01:50:01,986
[Abigail] Okay.

1458
01:50:03,901 --> 01:50:07,209
Okay. Okay, okay.
Let's get this day started.

1459
01:50:07,252 --> 01:50:09,385
Come on, everybody. Let's go.

1460
01:50:11,213 --> 01:50:12,910
- Okay.
- Cool.

1461
01:50:12,954 --> 01:50:15,957
[Abigail] Wait, wait, wait.
There's one more thing.

1462
01:50:17,698 --> 01:50:21,963
Because, last night,
we left our backpack here,

1463
01:50:22,006 --> 01:50:25,314
and, well,
we're not very sure, but...

1464
01:50:25,357 --> 01:50:28,796
...we think we're missing
a pack of pretzel sticks.

1465
01:50:30,014 --> 01:50:32,538
- You didn't take it, did you?
- No.

1466
01:50:32,582 --> 01:50:33,975
No.

1467
01:50:36,325 --> 01:50:38,501
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, we're sure! Come on.

1468
01:50:38,544 --> 01:50:41,983
- Why are we being accused?
- Oh, no, I'm not accusing you.

1469
01:50:42,026 --> 01:50:44,202
I'm just making sure, because...

1470
01:50:50,687 --> 01:50:51,949
What's this?

1471
01:50:54,038 --> 01:50:55,823
- Well, we didn't...
- You didn't?

1472
01:50:55,866 --> 01:50:57,302
- No.
- No, we didn't.

1473
01:50:57,346 --> 01:51:00,131
- And you're sure you didn't?
- We are sure we didn't.

1474
01:51:00,175 --> 01:51:02,003
- Very sure?
- Yes.

1475
01:51:05,310 --> 01:51:08,879
- I think they need to be punished.
- Yes, ma'am Paula.

1476
01:51:11,795 --> 01:51:14,189
This is really bad.

1477
01:51:14,232 --> 01:51:16,582
This is really, really bad.

1478
01:51:17,671 --> 01:51:19,585
[Carl] Oh, come on...

1479
01:51:19,629 --> 01:51:21,718
I mean, you didn't watch the
fire.

1480
01:51:21,762 --> 01:51:24,242
And then you steal
a pack of pretzel sticks?

1481
01:51:24,286 --> 01:51:27,115
- Yeah, and lie about it.
- We deserved it.

1482
01:51:27,158 --> 01:51:30,205
[Abigail] And not just to me,
to everybody here.

1483
01:51:32,076 --> 01:51:34,296
How can we trust you,
after what you did?

1484
01:51:34,339 --> 01:51:36,733
I need to say something now,
because this is becoming ridiculous.

1485
01:51:36,777 --> 01:51:41,129
- No, let me say something, Abigail.
- [Abigail] Did you see that?

1486
01:51:41,172 --> 01:51:42,957
What?

1487
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:46,047
Don't point at her.
Put your hands down.

1488
01:51:47,483 --> 01:51:50,965
- Okay, alright, Just let me say, though...
- [Abigail] Put your hands down!

1489
01:51:51,705 --> 01:51:53,141
What?

1490
01:51:53,184 --> 01:51:56,013
[Yaya] Your body language
is so aggressive, Carl!

1491
01:51:56,057 --> 01:51:59,190
- What?
- [Abigail] I'm not getting any food for you.

1492
01:51:59,234 --> 01:52:02,803
- You find your own food.
- What? Come on, man...

1493
01:52:02,846 --> 01:52:06,241
- No, Abigail, that's so unfair!
- Put your hands down.

1494
01:52:06,284 --> 01:52:09,635
You seriously don't get it.
Put your hands down!

1495
01:52:09,679 --> 01:52:13,378
- I'm trying to defend myself.
- Don't defend yourself!

1496
01:52:13,422 --> 01:52:17,339
You are inflicting pain on her
by defending yourself.

1497
01:52:35,270 --> 01:52:37,881
Shut the fuck up! No...

1498
01:52:40,405 --> 01:52:41,798
No!

1499
01:53:09,434 --> 01:53:11,741
[Dimitry] Hey! Ha-ha!

1500
01:53:13,047 --> 01:53:15,919
Oh... hey.

1501
01:53:16,920 --> 01:53:19,836
- What a nice fish, huh?
- Yes.

1502
01:53:19,880 --> 01:53:21,969
- Wow!
- We have a lot.

1503
01:53:23,013 --> 01:53:25,537
So it's dinner, huh? Great.

1504
01:53:27,322 --> 01:53:30,804
- Where did you get it?
- There, at the back of the rock.

1505
01:53:32,196 --> 01:53:34,938
- You're good at that.
- Thank you.

1506
01:53:38,724 --> 01:53:40,204
You need help?

1507
01:53:40,248 --> 01:53:43,512
Yeah, sure, get some Nutella.
[Laughs]

1508
01:54:05,839 --> 01:54:07,666
Oh, thank you!

1509
01:55:27,442 --> 01:55:29,270
[Yaya] What?

1510
01:55:40,803 --> 01:55:44,285

[Sighs]

1513
01:56:06,089 --> 01:56:09,440
[Abigail] Okay, I'm going
to the lifeboat now.

1514
01:56:09,484 --> 01:56:12,574
Ma'am Paula, can you stay here
and watch the fire?

1515
01:56:12,617 --> 01:56:14,010
Sure.

1516
01:56:16,970 --> 01:56:21,757
And since Carl didn't eat anything today,
he can sleep with me in the lifeboat.

1517
01:56:23,889 --> 01:56:25,369
Okay. Yeah.

1518
01:56:27,850 --> 01:56:29,417
[Dimitry chuckles]

1519
01:56:30,984 --> 01:56:34,857
- [Nelson] Can I come?
- [Carl] Abigail, can we both come or...?

1520
01:56:34,900 --> 01:56:37,120
[Abigail] No, just you.

1521
01:56:40,341 --> 01:56:44,084
- [Yaya] Fine, I'll take the pretzels!
- [Carl] Eh?

1522
01:56:48,653 --> 01:56:50,568
You're making this into an
issue.

1523
01:56:50,612 --> 01:56:52,831
Are you going to take them?
Yes, take them. Good.

1524
01:56:52,875 --> 01:56:56,096
- Why are you making this into an issue?
- [Whistle blowing]

1525
01:56:56,139 --> 01:56:58,228
I'm coming! One second!

1526
01:57:04,408 --> 01:57:08,064
- What are you gonna do on the boat?
- I don't know.

1527
01:57:09,892 --> 01:57:11,633
Don't act naive, seriously!

1528
01:57:11,676 --> 01:57:13,852
I don't know why she asked me,
but I'm gonna do it, of course...

1529
01:57:13,896 --> 01:57:15,376
- Really?
- Yes.

1530
01:57:15,419 --> 01:57:17,943
What do you think she wants with
you?

1531
01:57:17,987 --> 01:57:20,642
You're a young, hot guy. What do
you think she's going to do with you?

1532
01:57:20,685 --> 01:57:22,252
[Whistle blowing]

1533
01:57:22,296 --> 01:57:24,646
- Okay, then give them back...
- No. No!

1534
01:57:24,689 --> 01:57:27,649
- Let me take them back.
- No. And they're mine, okay?

1535
01:57:27,692 --> 01:57:30,217
Take a few, and I'll take them
back, cos I don't wanna do this.

1536
01:57:30,260 --> 01:57:32,175
- It's not a good idea.
- I want these!

1537
01:57:32,219 --> 01:57:36,658
You need to tell me what to do! You
need to tell me how to navigate this.

1538
01:57:36,701 --> 01:57:38,355
[Whistle blowing]

1539
01:57:42,403 --> 01:57:43,752
Yaya?

1540
01:57:47,538 --> 01:57:50,106
You just have to stroke her ego.

1541
01:57:53,240 --> 01:57:56,634
Just... laugh at her jokes.

1542
01:57:56,678 --> 01:57:59,072
- And... and smile.
- Mm-hmm...

1543
01:58:00,247 --> 01:58:01,596
Okay.

1544
01:58:01,639 --> 01:58:04,555
- Make sure to set up boundaries.
- Yeah.

1545
01:58:04,599 --> 01:58:08,472
- And nothing sexual, okay?
- No, I won't do anything sexual.

1546
01:58:09,169 --> 01:58:10,561
Mm-hmm...

1547
01:58:10,605 --> 01:58:12,302
And don't do anything
you wouldn't want me to do.

1548
01:58:12,346 --> 01:58:14,565
No, I won't do anything
you're not comfortable with.

1549
01:58:14,609 --> 01:58:17,525
No kissing. Nothing like that!

1550
01:58:21,877 --> 01:58:23,966
Yaya, I think she's probably
expecting something.

1551
01:58:25,794 --> 01:58:28,884
- Like what?
- I don't know... I, er...

1552
01:58:30,146 --> 01:58:31,974
- A massage, or...
- A massage?

1553
01:58:32,017 --> 01:58:34,977
- I don't know. She might want something.
- Definitely not a massage!

1554
01:58:35,020 --> 01:58:37,458
She just gave me a whole fucking
packet of pretzels for you...

1555
01:58:37,501 --> 01:58:39,938
I don't know what to say...
I can't do anything?

1556
01:58:39,982 --> 01:58:41,679
- No!
- Okay, but...

1557
01:58:41,723 --> 01:58:44,552
- Massage her neck. Okay?
- I can massage her neck?

1558
01:58:44,595 --> 01:58:46,989
- Her neck, that's it!
- Okay, okay, okay...

1559
01:58:49,383 --> 01:58:51,124
Okay.

1560
01:58:53,256 --> 01:58:55,693
- I love you so much.
- Well, I hate you.

1561
01:58:55,737 --> 01:58:58,131
I understand! Fuck...

1562

- Oh, morning.
- Asshole.

1566
01:59:26,376 --> 01:59:29,162

- [Dimitry] Hey, you!
- [Indistinct voices]

1568
02:00:12,335 --> 02:00:14,642

What?

1574
02:00:38,579 --> 02:00:40,624
[Carl] What the fuck?

1575

- Pretty boy!
- We can see you!

02:01:15,703 --> 02:01:19,097
Have you ever used your...
when you were young?

1582
02:01:21,970 --> 02:01:24,233
Oh, you slept with somebody
to get a job?

1583
02:01:35,418 --> 02:01:37,420
No, you didn't?

1584
02:01:37,464 --> 02:01:40,162
Really? Once?

- Give it to me!
- Take it! Take it.

Give me the whistle!

- What was it?
- I don't know what it is.

- What's going on?
- They're hunting something.

[Nelson] No. We don't go there.
What?

- [Jarmo] Thank you very much.

1627
02:05:29,043 --> 02:05:34,962
Okay... To kill a donkey,
it may be a great achievement.

1628
02:05:35,005 --> 02:05:38,008
But there's one thing
that's so much greater.

1629

- [Yaya] To paint!
- To paint, yes!

1630

- Who did this one?
- [Yaya] Me.

1635
02:05:56,070 --> 02:05:59,421
Okay, the feet are close, close
together.

1636
02:05:59,464 --> 02:06:02,816
This donkey wants to be in
control.

1637
02:06:02,859 --> 02:06:06,254
But it looks almost scared.

1638
02:06:07,124 --> 02:06:09,387
You want to tell this donkey
to...

1639
02:06:10,475 --> 02:06:12,303
...to not be so scared.

1640
02:06:12,347 --> 02:06:17,352
To lose control and bound away
across the fields,

1641
02:06:17,395 --> 02:06:20,224
wildly waving its tail!

1642
02:06:21,312 --> 02:06:24,707
- Sure, it will make mistakes...
- Carl, what are you doing?

1643
02:06:28,668 --> 02:06:29,886
Huh?

02:06:31,453 --> 02:06:33,498
- [Yaya] Carl?
- Yeah.

1645
02:06:36,110 --> 02:06:38,329
What are you doing with your
hand?

1646
02:06:41,115 --> 02:06:44,074
- [Carl] Which one?
- Seriously?

1647
02:06:48,731 --> 02:06:50,951
I'm just resting it on the
chair.

1648
02:06:53,170 --> 02:06:56,391
Why is your hand
under her jacket on a chair?

1649
02:06:58,132 --> 02:06:59,612
[Carl] What...?

1650
02:07:00,656 --> 02:07:02,832
It was just...
I don't know, it was there,

1651
02:07:02,876 --> 02:07:05,618
resting on the side of... the
chair.

1652

[Distant thunder]

1653
02:07:28,728 --> 02:07:31,644
[Abigail] I'm coming.
I'm coming!

02:07:33,080 --> 02:07:34,734
I'm coming...

1655
02:07:34,777 --> 02:07:37,519
- Oh, I can't concentrate...
- Oh, God!

1656
02:07:53,622 --> 02:07:55,580
Okay, you know...

1657
02:07:55,624 --> 02:07:59,193
...if you can't handle it, just tell me,
nobody's forcing you to do anything.

1658
02:07:59,236 --> 02:08:03,284
It's just all this fucking sneaking
around and hiding things from everyone.

1659
02:08:03,327 --> 02:08:06,591
It's too much. It's... it's
becoming unbearable.

1660
02:08:06,635 --> 02:08:10,378
I mean, they're obviously not
happy with what we're doing in here.

1661
02:08:12,902 --> 02:08:17,254
Okay, so... Let's just... tell
them the truth.

1662
02:08:20,693 --> 02:08:25,915
You give me something, and I
give you something in return.

1663
02:08:31,094 --> 02:08:33,706
You realize what position
that puts me in?

1664
02:08:34,837 --> 02:08:36,056
No.

1665
02:08:37,840 --> 02:08:41,931
Well, just because it's more
open that you're a flesh peddler,

1666
02:08:41,975 --> 02:08:43,803
it doesn't mean
they're gonna accept the fact

1667
02:08:43,846 --> 02:08:46,501
that you're buying sex
with the common food.

1668
02:08:47,241 --> 02:08:49,025
Wow...

1669
02:08:50,200 --> 02:08:51,767
Oh, come on, I didn't...

1670
02:08:51,811 --> 02:08:54,204
Do you know the amount of work
I put into this island?

1671
02:08:54,248 --> 02:08:57,381
- I go fishing every day, I make fire...
- I know, I know.

1672
02:08:57,425 --> 02:08:59,949
- I'm responsible for everybody here!
- I know, I'm sorry, I know.

1673
02:08:59,993 --> 02:09:04,084
- Shouldn't that give me an advantage?
- Yeah, yeah, of course.

1674
02:09:04,127 --> 02:09:07,783
- Okay!
- You deserve to do what you want, I know.

1675
02:09:15,835 --> 02:09:18,794
The absurd thing is that,
if we were a couple,

1676
02:09:18,838 --> 02:09:21,666
they wouldn't care
what we did in here.

1677
02:09:24,582 --> 02:09:28,412
But, really, maybe we should just do
that, maybe we should just get on with it.

1678
02:09:28,456 --> 02:09:31,372
I don't know, kiss a little bit
in public and hold hands.

1679
02:09:31,415 --> 02:09:34,114
- Surely that would be easier?
- What about Yaya?

1680
02:09:34,157 --> 02:09:38,248
I would have a conversation with
Yaya. I would have to be an adult about it.

1681
02:09:38,292 --> 02:09:42,992
And figure it out, but... I think it
would be easier for her, probably.

1682
02:09:43,036 --> 02:09:45,778
I mean, she's having to deal
with all this gossip as well.

1683
02:09:45,821 --> 02:09:48,041
Carl, I... I don't know.

1684
02:09:56,701 --> 02:09:59,052
Do you want me
to break up with Yaya?

1685
02:09:59,095 --> 02:10:00,749
- No.
- No?

1686
02:10:02,925 --> 02:10:05,449
That's your decision, not mine.

1687
02:10:08,322 --> 02:10:12,413
I'm not asking you to do it, I'm
just seeing what you think about it.

1688
02:10:12,456 --> 02:10:16,069
I know, but that doesn't mean that you
can put me in-between the two of you.

1689
02:10:16,112 --> 02:10:17,592
Okay, okay.

1690
02:10:25,948 --> 02:10:28,472
It's kind of a perfect scenario
for you, I mean...

1691
02:10:30,083 --> 02:10:32,346
You get what you want,
you have no obligations,

1692
02:10:32,389 --> 02:10:34,696
no responsibilities, you know.

1693
02:10:34,739 --> 02:10:36,872
Why do you have to make
everything so complicated?

1694
02:10:36,916 --> 02:10:40,354
Because I feel like I need to
know where this is going, Abigail.

1695
02:10:42,878 --> 02:10:44,880
Let's just have fun.

1696
02:10:44,924 --> 02:10:47,187
No, but I need to try to deal
with this situation.

1697
02:10:47,230 --> 02:10:49,232
I... I don't wanna piss off...

1698
02:10:51,582 --> 02:10:53,846
I don't wanna annoy anyone
anymore.

1699
02:10:56,152 --> 02:10:59,939
Do you remember what you said
the first night you were here?

1700
02:10:59,982 --> 02:11:01,766
What did you say?

1701
02:11:03,899 --> 02:11:06,684
"I love you, you give me fish."

1702
02:11:06,728 --> 02:11:08,338
Exactly.

1703
02:11:08,382 --> 02:11:11,733
And do you know why
that is so beautiful?

1704
02:11:11,776 --> 02:11:13,300
- No.
- Like you...

1705
02:11:13,343 --> 02:11:15,737
- Why?
- Because it's the truth.

1706
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:23,876
So, Nelson... you're a pirate,
huh?

1707
02:11:25,442 --> 02:11:27,183
Come on, stop it.

1708
02:11:29,359 --> 02:11:32,623
Okay. If I was a pirate,
what would you ask me?

1709
02:11:32,667 --> 02:11:35,017
How much money do you make?

1710
02:11:36,410 --> 02:11:38,238
Yeah, of course.

1711
02:11:38,281 --> 02:11:41,632
I don't know, like... 3,000
euros.

1712
02:11:41,676 --> 02:11:43,896
- On one attack?
- Yeah, one attack.

1713
02:11:44,853 --> 02:11:46,507
If we succeed.

1714
02:11:47,551 --> 02:11:50,641
So, you work on commission, huh?

1715
02:11:50,685 --> 02:11:52,643
- Yeah.
- Shit!

1716
02:11:52,687 --> 02:11:54,907
The client is making all money?

1717
02:11:55,820 --> 02:11:59,085
Yeah, but you can make more
if you have your own boat.

1718
02:12:01,565 --> 02:12:05,047
3,000 euros...
Come on, you're crazy.

1719
02:12:06,092 --> 02:12:08,529
My girlfriend is expensive.

1720
02:12:08,572 --> 02:12:11,271
What? You invest in your
girlfriend?

1721
02:12:11,314 --> 02:12:13,360
- Yeah.
- Ah...

1722
02:12:13,403 --> 02:12:16,015
You should do it
the other way around.

1723
02:12:16,058 --> 02:12:19,409
Invest in business, buy a boat,
and the girls will come to you.

1724
02:12:19,453 --> 02:12:20,541
Yeah?

1725
02:12:21,281 --> 02:12:23,587

Hey.

1729
02:12:41,257 --> 02:12:44,173
I was just wondering
if I could borrow the backpack.

1730
02:12:44,217 --> 02:12:46,915
- Abigail?
- [Abigail] Yeah, I know.

1731
02:12:46,959 --> 02:12:50,266
- What are you going to do, Yaya?
- Go for a hike over the mountain.

1732
02:12:50,310 --> 02:12:52,486
See if I can find something.

1733
02:12:55,750 --> 02:12:59,580
- [Abigail] I'll go with you.
- It's okay, I can go by myself.

1734
02:12:59,623 --> 02:13:03,453
No, Yaya, it's not safe for you
to go alone. I'll go with you.

1735
02:13:04,933 --> 02:13:06,326
Okay.

1736
02:13:10,808 --> 02:13:14,899
- Do you want me to come?
- No. You stay here.

1737
02:13:14,943 --> 02:13:16,989
I need some time alone with her.

1738
02:13:17,032 --> 02:13:18,512
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1739
02:13:24,605 --> 02:13:26,346
[Yaya] I'll take it.

1740
02:13:54,287 --> 02:13:56,506
I'm glad we're doing this
together, Yaya.

1741
02:13:58,552 --> 02:13:59,988
Me, too.

1742
02:14:00,858 --> 02:14:03,383
I actually wanted
to tell you that I'm...

1743
02:14:03,426 --> 02:14:06,255
...really impressed by
everything you're doing here.

1744

Yeah!

1748
02:14:26,188 --> 02:14:27,537
Thank you.

1749
02:14:31,454 --> 02:14:33,456
No, it's really impressive.

1750
02:14:41,595 --> 02:14:44,032
We should stick together, huh?

1751
02:15:09,840 --> 02:15:11,494
Oh, my God...

1752
02:15:14,497 --> 02:15:17,239
