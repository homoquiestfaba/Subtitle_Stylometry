1
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:11,378
(silence)

2
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:36,102
(music)

3
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:01,221
Hi there.

4
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:01,921
Hi there, my name's Ted.

5
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:05,892
Nice to meet ya.

6
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:06,759
Hi there.

7
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,595
My name's Ted.

8
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,430
Nice to meet you.

9
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,812
Hi there.

10
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:27,547
My name's Ted.

11
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,951
Nice to meet ya.

12
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:02,609
Now the sociopath

13
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:03,910
represents a different set

14
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:05,411
of problems for the mental

15
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:06,613
health worker.

16
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:09,315
For the sociopath does not

17
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,550
suffer from the sort of

18
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,986
repressed impulses that the

19
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,088
neurotic patient needs to

20
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:17,690
examine and to recognize.

21
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,993
He will lie, he will cheat,

22
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:22,962
even kill to attain

23
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:25,031
his ends.

24
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:27,367
And not even the prospect of

25
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,736
swift and sure punishment

26
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,338
will deter him from his path

27
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:37,777
to gratification.

28
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,983
Four beers, please.

29
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:32,185
Want to dance?

30
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,553
Oh, I just got here.

31
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,555
But thanks anyway.

32
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:51,938
Come on.

33
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,639
Dance with me.

34
00:07:53,673 --> 00:08:00,179
I won't bite, I promise.

35
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:04,116
You won't regret it.

36
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:16,562
are you a student?

37
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:17,230
Uh, huh.

38
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:18,164
Me too.

39
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:24,103
Groovy

40
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:55,034
Urn, thanks.

41
00:08:55,067 --> 00:09:00,773
Sure.

42
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:09,949
I am so drunk I

43
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:15,621
am hallucinating.

44
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:37,036
Aw, hell.

45
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:42,308
You again?

46
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:12,271
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

47
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:18,277
Shit! Fuck! Fuck!

48
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:12,765
(screaming)

49
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:44,964
(laughing)

50
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:22,535
This better be

51
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:23,869
good, Ted.

52
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:24,470
I just needed to hear

53
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:29,175
your voice.

54
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,443
It's four in the morning.

55
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,279
I know, Lee.

56
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,046
I've been hitting the books

57
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,880
so hard I lost track

58
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:35,948
of time.

59
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:36,549
I haven't heard from you

60
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:38,184
in nearly a week.

61
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:38,951
I've been

62
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:39,552
studying. Lee.

63
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:40,486
I'm sorry.

64
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:41,287
Yes, I know you've

65
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,621
been studying.

66
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,191
But, uh, God, I just ... I

67
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:46,091
hate the way you make me

68
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,128
feel sometimes.

69
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,063
I need to see you.

70
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:51,964
You only want to see me

71
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:52,598
when it's convenient

72
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,600
for you.

73
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:55,367
Why can't you just

74
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,303
be honest?

75
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,204
You don't really love me.

76
00:13:58,237 --> 00:13:59,171
Not really.

77
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:02,241
If you did, you would call.

78
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:05,077
Lee, I just ... I just

79
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:09,114
need to hold you.

80
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:10,015
Then why don't you come

81
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:11,083
over right now?

82
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:11,617
I'll make you something

83
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:15,554
to eat.

84
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:16,455
How 'bout tomorrow, Lee?

85
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:22,595
I'm really tired.

86
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:23,395
First tell me what I

87
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:29,101
need to hear.

88
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:32,004
I love you, Lee.

89
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:32,605
And I haven't been seeing

90
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:37,610
anyone else.

91
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:43,015
Now get some sleep, okay?

92
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:50,322
You can't hide from

93
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:52,191
me, Ted.

94
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,025
Ted!

95
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:56,228
Hey cutie pie.

96
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,062
How are ya?

97
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:57,997
Whoa.

98
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:58,497
Oh. No.

99
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,732
No

100
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:01,000
Look, mommy, it's almost

101
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,101
in outer space.

102
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:02,635
It sure is, hon.

103
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,703
Hmm...

104
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,971
Make it come back

105
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:07,973
Well, I can't do that.

106
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:08,607
Did you ever hear the story

107
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:09,275
about the little girl who

108
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:09,942
was holding a balloon and a

109
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:10,442
gust of wind came along and

110
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,278
carried her away?

111
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:13,279
That never happened.

112
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,647
You're just being silly.

113
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,248
Yes, it did.

114
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:17,082
No, I'm not being silly.

115
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:17,983
Aargh, aargh.

116
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:20,219
Oh, ho, ho!

117
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,387
Show you silly.

118
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,721
I gotcha.

119
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,656
I gotcha.

120
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,257
I gotcha.

121
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,099
Be careful.

122
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:34,667
If I had one-tenth her

123
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,401
energy, school would be

124
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,402
a breeze.

125
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,269
She's just showing off

126
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:38,170
for you.

127
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:39,038
Yeah.

128
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:39,538
I seem to have that effect

129
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:40,673
on women.

130
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:42,741
Oh, no, she - she really

131
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,110
adores you, Ted.

132
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,413
So do i.

133
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:50,616
And I adore you, Lee.

134
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:53,018
So, one day maybe I

135
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:53,752
won't have to share you with

136
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,087
so many women

137
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,155
You're so stupid

138
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:56,822
Yeah.

139
00:15:56,855 --> 00:15:57,456
I may be stupid, but not so

140
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:58,490
stupid to think you don't

141
00:15:58,524 --> 00:15:59,325
have plenty of

142
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:00,192
other admirers.

143
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:01,427
Yeah, Lee.

144
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,394
I have admirers, but just

145
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,429
because someone admires me

146
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,363
doesn't mean I'm sleeping

147
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:06,565
with them.

148
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:07,733
Look, look, I don't want

149
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:10,169
to start an argument, okay?

150
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:13,238
I was just hoping we could

151
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,306
commit to each other.

152
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,141
Like really commit, Ted.

153
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:19,078
We are committed.

154
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,045
And I love you, so can we

155
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,717
just focus on that?

156
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,684
Really?

157
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:28,320
Yeah. Really.

158
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,063
Urn. Urn.

159
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:38,464
What's that?

160
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,599
What?

161
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:46,338
What's that?

162
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:47,840
Did you steal this, Ted?

163
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:49,608
(laughs) No.

164
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:51,210
Ted!

165
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:51,744
Well, it's not like it's the

166
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:52,478
first time it's ever

167
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,513
happened, huh?

168
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:55,347
Just - just keep your

169
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:55,981
voice down, okay?

170
00:16:56,014 --> 00:16:56,648
Why, you afraid somebody

171
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,182
might find out the wonderful

172
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:58,484
Ted Bundy's a thief?

173
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,418
You tell anyone that, I

174
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:00,252
will break your fucking

175
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:02,454
neck, you hear me?

176
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:03,322
No. Take

177
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:03,889
it back!

178
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:04,556
Give it to one of your

179
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,257
other girls!

180
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,593
I didn't steal the watch, Lee!

181
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,097
Look.

182
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:13,265
Listen to me.

183
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:14,767
You have a future.

184
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,135
And you've worked so hard.

185
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:16,802
What do you think is going

186
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:17,636
to happen to that future if

187
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:18,437
you get caught

188
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,271
stealing, huh?

189
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:20,506
Yeah, right.

190
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,240
Why do you talk

191
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:23,275
like this?

192
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:23,909
It's easy, because first I

193
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:24,777
flunked out of law school

194
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:25,411
and now I'm flunking

195
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:29,381
psychology.

196
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:30,282
Ted, why didn't you

197
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:33,519
tell me?

198
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:37,489
I don't know, I just..

199
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:41,260
Look, there's still two

200
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:42,661
months left in the semester

201
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,229
and I can still help you.

202
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:44,830
But if you just

203
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:47,399
give up. Ted...

204
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:48,200
Look, I didn't steal

205
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:51,203
the watch.

206
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,137
I just wanted to get

207
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,372
something nice for my gal.

208
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,475
Show my appreciation.

209
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:57,376
After all you've done for

210
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,510
me, all the money you've

211
00:17:58,544 --> 00:17:59,178
given me to stay in school,

212
00:17:59,211 --> 00:17:59,845
I figured it was the least I

213
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:03,749
could do.

214
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:04,450
It's a beautiful

215
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:05,851
watch, Ted.

216
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:08,187
Thank you.

217
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,555
I'm sorry I ever

218
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:14,626
doubted you.

219
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:16,428
Is it good?

220
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:17,429
Yes.

221
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:18,230
Is it good?

222
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:21,800
Yeah.

223
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:27,206
Let's try something else.

224
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:30,776
What?

225
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:31,577
Come on.

226
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,946
Flip over.

227
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:34,847
No! No,

228
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,581
you know I don't

229
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,315
like that.

230
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:37,282
It's disgusting.

231
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:37,916
Lee, it's just another way

232
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,751
to make love.

233
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,552
No, it has nothing to do

234
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:41,353
with love.

235
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:43,255
It's just, it's dirty.

236
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,256
Lee, sex is only dirty

237
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,525
when you do it right.

238
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:47,793
Let's just do

239
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:50,596
it regular.

240
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,532
Okay. Fine.

241
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,868
We'll do it regular.

242
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:57,870
Okay? 'cause

243
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:58,871
that's what feels

244
00:18:58,904 --> 00:18:59,738
like love,

245
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:01,473
right? Yeah?

246
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:02,374
Yeah.

247
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:03,475
That feel like love?

248
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:07,880
Yeah? Good.

249
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:08,514
How 'bout that?

250
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:09,414
Ted!

251
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:09,915
Does that feel like

252
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:10,549
love? Huh?

253
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:11,283
Does that feel like love?

254
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:11,783
Ted!

255
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,318
What about this?

256
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:14,486
Does that feel like love?

257
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,787
Oh, you're choking me!

258
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,488
That's what love feels

259
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:17,489
like to me, Lee!

260
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:21,593
No! Ted!

261
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:24,496
What, are you nuts?

262
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:28,800
I gotta go.

263
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:30,369
No.

264
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:31,303
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

265
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,671
It's fine, Lee.

266
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:36,508
It's fine.

267
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:38,610
Am I going to see

268
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:39,411
you tomorrow?

269
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:40,312
Yeah.

270
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:40,913
I'm at the crisis center

271
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:41,914
from eleven to three.

272
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:44,783
I'll call you when I'm done.

273
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,488
I-I remember it was my

274
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,455
birthday that day and

275
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:51,590
afterwards, when all the

276
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:53,258
kids went home, he, urn,

277
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:55,894
came up into my room and

278
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:58,330
made me put it in my mouth.

279
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,698
He put it in your mouth?

280
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,300
Yeah. I didn't

281
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:01,900
want him to be all

282
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:02,568
mad again.

283
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:05,938
I wanted to make him happy.

284
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:07,739
Did you tell anyone?

285
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:10,375
Yeah, my mother.

286
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:11,543
She didn't believe me.

287
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,045
And if she did, she just

288
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:16,682
looked the other way.

289
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,182
You must have a lot of

290
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,684
anger towards her.

291
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:19,618
I don't know.

292
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:22,955
She's dead now.

293
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,692
You still there, Ted?

294
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,628
Mh-hm, I'm still here.

295
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:30,562
Well, uh, tell me

296
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:31,196
one thing.

297
00:20:31,229 --> 00:20:34,366
Why are men such assholes?

298
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,033
Well, I think you just

299
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,436
haven't met the right guy.

300
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:38,370
You sound like one of

301
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,540
those right kind of guys.

302
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,443
Thank you, Karen.

303
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:46,612
Look, Karen, one day you'll

304
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:47,679
find a love that's deeper

305
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:48,647
and more meaningful than

306
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,481
anything you've ever

307
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:51,016
imagined.

308
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:52,017
God. Do you

309
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,352
really think so, Ted?

310
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:55,621
I know so.

311
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:56,521
Do you think we could

312
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:57,456
talk again.

313
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:58,423
Ted? I gotta

314
00:20:58,457 --> 00:20:59,391
go to work now.

315
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,359
Uh-huh.

316
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:01,727
Anytime, okay?

317
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,528
Okay.

318
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:04,730
Take care, Karen.

319
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:05,731
All right.

320
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:06,498
And don't do

321
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:07,032
anything crazy.

322
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:09,301
All right.

323
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,697
(doorbell rings)

324
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:53,839
Where have you

325
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,975
been? Huh?

326
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:57,809
You said you were going to

327
00:22:57,843 --> 00:23:00,445
call and you didn't.

328
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,214
Ted? Ted.

329
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:03,115
Oh, my God!

330
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:03,849
Are you okay?

331
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,450
What's wrong?

332
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:08,453
Are you sick?

333
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:12,691
Actually, I'm really hungry

334
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:20,599
You really were

335
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:22,634
hungry, huh?

336
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:27,439
Yep.

337
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:36,148
Whatcha thinkin' about?

338
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:41,119
The future.

339
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:42,020
How I want things to

340
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:43,922
turn out.

341
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:44,823
How do you want things

342
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:48,927
to turn out?

343
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,828
Well, I guess we could

344
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:50,762
start with the basic premise

345
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:51,630
that whoever dies with the

346
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:54,966
most toys, wins.

347
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,168
Okay.

348
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:58,570
You want a lot of toys.

349
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:03,175
What else?

350
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:04,609
Good job.

351
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:08,079
Nice clothes.

352
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:11,616
New car.

353
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,584
All the things I didn't have

354
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:15,887
growing up.

355
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:16,922
Maybe go into politics.

356
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:17,622
I still haven't given up

357
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:18,790
on that.

358
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:23,528
Mm-hm.

359
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:24,095
But mostly, I just want

360
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,797
to be normal.

361
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:26,364
What?

362
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:27,032
You don't think you're

363
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:32,103
normal?

364
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:35,674
I'm trying to be.

365
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:38,977
Oh, Ted...

366
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:43,815
I'm really trying to be

367
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:56,221
Don't make a

368
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:57,289
sound. Understand?

369
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:59,090
(whines)

370
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:00,325
Yes? Okay,

371
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:01,760
now get up.

372
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:06,031
Get up.

373
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:06,564
What do you want?

374
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:08,233
Shut up and listen.

375
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:08,967
Cooperate and everything's

376
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,534
going to be okay.

377
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:09,901
Otherwise, I'm going to

378
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:12,170
kill you.

379
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:12,704
Okay.

380
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:13,672
Do you believe me?

381
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:14,306
Yeah.

382
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:16,341
Good. Now, I

383
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:17,375
just broke into your

384
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:22,013
apartment. Why

385
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:22,847
do you want to

386
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:24,049
believe me?

387
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:30,188
(music)

388
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:19,971
A drink?

389
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:21,373
Oh, yeah.

390
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:29,881
Whoa.

391
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:33,385
Nice TV.

392
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:34,019
Yeah, it's a gift from

393
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:35,720
my parents.

394
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:38,390
They're cool, huh?

395
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:41,026
Yeah.

396
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:41,926
So when do I get to meet

397
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,296
your folks?

398
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,498
Mmm ... They look like

399
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:48,199
nice people.

400
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:51,169
They are nice people.

401
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:52,937
So what's the problem?

402
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:53,805
Who said there was

403
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,741
a problem?

404
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:57,375
What, do

405
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:58,743
I embarrass

406
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:02,147
you? Huh?

407
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,148
You're the most paranoid

408
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,516
woman I ever met.

409
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:05,316
No, well, you've met

410
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:05,950
my parents.

411
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:07,018
Yeah, and someday you'll

412
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:09,421
meet mine.

413
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:10,889
Someday?

414
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:11,456
Don't start,

415
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:12,524
Lee. Jesus.

416
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:13,758
No, it's just, if

417
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:15,193
there's a problem, I want to

418
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:16,061
know about it.

419
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:16,928
Yes, there's a problem.

420
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:17,562
But just because there's a

421
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:18,430
problem doesn't mean that

422
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:21,499
you're the center of it.

423
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:22,434
Come on, please, just

424
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:23,101
tell me.

425
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:23,968
I don't want there to be any

426
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:25,937
secrets between

427
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:30,442
us. Please?

428
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:35,213
I'm illegitimate.

429
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:37,816
That's it?

430
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:39,084
I'm a bastard.

431
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:40,151
Ooh.

432
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:41,219
That's an ugly word and it

433
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:42,253
should be removed from the

434
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:44,055
english language.

435
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:44,856
Maybe so, but it's

436
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,424
still true.

437
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,793
Stop saying that.

438
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:50,195
Don't ever, ever, ever

439
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:53,364
say that.

440
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:53,932
Imagine being five years

441
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:55,100
old and finding out that

442
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:56,534
your sister is really

443
00:28:56,568 --> 00:29:00,205
your mother.

444
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,372
Okay, and that would be

445
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,340
a little weird.

446
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:02,974
Yeah, and then being

447
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:03,541
seventeen and finding out

448
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,442
that your father's not

449
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:07,445
your father.

450
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:08,246
Well, they still loved

451
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:11,416
you, didn't they?

452
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:12,283
Yes, they loved me.

453
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:13,084
Of course they loved me.

454
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:14,018
Yeah.

455
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:18,223
Who could not love you?

456
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:29,400
Ah, damn.

457
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,136
Aah.

458
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:31,769
Whenever I see anybody

459
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:32,337
carrying that many books,

460
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,238
they're studying to be

461
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,139
a doctor.

462
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:34,839
Yeah, well, in this case,

463
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:36,975
it's law school.

464
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:37,375
Well, those aren't

465
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,409
law books.

466
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,110
No, these are for

467
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:40,879
everything else.

468
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:41,446
Is there any chance I can

469
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:42,147
get you to help me carry

470
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,381
these to my car?

471
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:44,149
I'm basically helpless with

472
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:45,850
this cast.

473
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:47,318
Well, okay.

474
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:48,119
But if I need any legal

475
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:49,554
advice, you owe me one

476
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:51,990
Its a deal.

477
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:53,024
It's, uh, over here.

478
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:57,395
Okay.

479
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:57,962
I hope this isn't going to

480
00:29:57,996 --> 00:29:59,130
make you late for class.

481
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:05,170
No, I'm fine.

482
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:06,538
If you could just, uh, put

483
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:07,405
them on the floor

484
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:08,173
right there.

485
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:11,976
Okay.

486
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:24,422
The killer came in from

487
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:25,190
the night...

488
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:25,757
Just what this town

489
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:26,457
needs, a psycho killer

490
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,126
running around.

491
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,427
Well, don't look at me.

492
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,262
I didn't do it.

493
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:32,163
I think we can rule you

494
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:33,932
out as a suspect, Ted.

495
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:34,566
I can't wait to see what

496
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:35,433
the son-of-a-bitch

497
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:36,434
looks like.

498
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:37,302
You really think it's just

499
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,203
one guy responsible?

500
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:39,437
You know, what the police

501
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,438
say and what they think are

502
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:41,172
often two completely

503
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:42,941
different things.

504
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:44,309
That's what I think.

505
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,176
I think that they hold a lot

506
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,010
of stuff back so that

507
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:46,611
there's stuff only the

508
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:49,314
perpetrator knows.

509
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:49,881
Do you think those women

510
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:52,150
could still be alive?

511
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,051
No way.

512
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:54,652
They're way dead.

513
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:55,987
Ted, this is a party.

514
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,921
No one wants to talk about

515
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:58,523
this.

516
00:30:58,556 --> 00:30:59,991
Oh, really, Lee?

517
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:00,425
What subjects can we

518
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:03,228
talk about?

519
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:04,996
Actually, uh, I think

520
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,031
it's fascinating.

521
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:07,932
Well, I think its sick

522
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:09,334
and disgusting.

523
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,201
Well, certainly murder is

524
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:12,270
aberrant behavior, but, I

525
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:13,471
mean, the psychology that

526
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:14,672
motivates it is really quite

527
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:15,473
interesting, don't

528
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:16,708
you think?

529
00:31:16,741 --> 00:31:18,376
Totally.

530
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:19,210
I think I need a

531
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:21,079
refill.

532
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:21,613
I'm, so sorry.

533
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:22,347
I'm Betty.

534
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,014
Hi Betty.

535
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:23,548
I'm Ted.

536
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:24,115
Nice to meet you.

537
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:28,286
Nice to meet you, too.

538
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,288
Lee, right?

539
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:31,256
That's me.

540
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:32,223
I'm Beverly from the

541
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:34,359
crisis center.

542
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,227
You know, I-I work with Ted

543
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:37,729
at the crisis center.

544
00:31:37,762 --> 00:31:39,297
Oh, great. Hi.

545
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,198
Oh, he is doing

546
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,133
really great.

547
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:43,401
I- he has an amazing knack

548
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:45,003
with the callers.

549
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:46,104
He always knows the exact

550
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:49,274
right thing to say.

551
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:50,375
Yep, he sure has a way

552
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:53,378
with people, all right.

553
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,402
Oh, my God!

554
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,604
Please don't hurt me.

555
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:20,638
I'm not going to hurt you.

556
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:22,707
What do you want?

557
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,308
I just want you to listen

558
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:25,276
to me.

559
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,010
Pay me a little bit

560
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:28,579
of attention.

561
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:29,247
See, girls like you, they

562
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,014
don't pay attention to guys

563
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:31,749
like me.

564
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,183
Guys who don't came from

565
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:34,285
good families.

566
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,187
Who don't go to top schools,

567
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:39,090
or drive fancy cars.

568
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:39,691
(whimpers)

569
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:40,792
Shut up and

570
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:46,130
listen! God!

571
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:46,698
Don't get me wrong.

572
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:47,732
I'm not some share the

573
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:49,701
wealth' type of pinko creep

574
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:50,568
or something.

575
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:51,502
Don't do this to me.

576
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:53,771
In fact, I'm a republican.

577
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,373
I worked on a number of

578
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:57,709
campaigns, and one day, I'm

579
00:32:57,742 --> 00:33:01,045
gonna be governor.

580
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:01,579
You don't even believe me,

581
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:04,048
do you?

582
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:04,582
You probably just think I'm

583
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:06,351
some kind of loser.

584
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:09,354
Well, maybe you're right.

585
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:10,321
Maybe I'm not so important

586
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:13,624
out there, but here, I'm

587
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,427
in charge.

588
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:19,464
Here, I'm in control.

589
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:20,732
Because this is the court

590
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:22,367
of Ted!

591
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,337
What I say here is law!

592
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:27,071
You get the

593
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:28,139
picture?

594
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,440
(screams)

595
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:31,709
(screams)

596
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:35,713
(cries)

597
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:42,387
Do I have your

598
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:47,058
attention now?

599
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:58,469
And Julie's staying with

600
00:33:58,503 --> 00:33:59,837
your parents for how long?

601
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,106
All month.

602
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,107
I was kind of hoping maybe

603
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:04,242
we could spend some time

604
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:04,876
together alone before you

605
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:05,676
went off, back to

606
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,312
law school.

607
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:09,380
I told you a thousand

608
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:10,248
times, you can come with me

609
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:12,183
if you want to.

610
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:12,817
Your enthusiasm isn't

611
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:15,853
exactly overwhelming, Ted.

612
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:16,287
Hey, you gotta make your

613
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:16,954
own decision.

614
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:18,322
I mean, if things don't work

615
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:19,123
out, I don't want it to be

616
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:20,525
my fault.

617
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:21,225
I don't want to

618
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:21,859
argue, okay?

619
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:22,527
I am just saying, we both

620
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,728
know the reason why I am not

621
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:25,296
going with you to salt lake.

622
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:26,564
Mm-hm.

623
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:27,198
And what is it?

624
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,534
You don't want me to go.

625
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,334
Oh. You know,

626
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:31,302
you're giving me

627
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:34,405
a headache.

628
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:40,411
Is she going with you?

629
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:41,879
Is who going with me

630
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,448
That woman at the party.

631
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:44,115
The one you were talking to

632
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:44,916
that thought murderers were

633
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:47,618
'oh so fascinating'

634
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:48,352
You're certifiable, you

635
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:48,820
know that?

636
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:49,353
You're a hundred

637
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:50,721
percent certifiable.

638
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:51,556
That's right, Ted, just

639
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:52,890
dismiss it.

640
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:53,925
Treat me like I'm crazy.

641
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:55,159
Anybody with the audacity to

642
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:56,427
disagree with the great Ted

643
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:57,295
Bundy has to be

644
00:34:57,328 --> 00:35:03,768
crazy, right?

645
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:15,213
What the hell?

646
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:18,549
Asshole!

647
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:19,851
You're such a fucking jerk.

648
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:20,618
Look, I don't know why

649
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:21,619
you're so upset.

650
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:27,291
It was a joke.

651
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:28,593
Where are my keys?

652
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,195
Don't ask me.

653
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:42,540
What the hell are these?

654
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:43,508
I dunno.

655
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:46,844
I've never seen them before.

656
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:14,772
Who's a pretty girl?

657
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:17,375
You are.

658
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:20,311
You're the pretty girl.

659
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:23,614
Yeah, you are.

660
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:30,288
(knock on door)

661
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:31,956
Who is it?

662
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:36,661
It's me

663
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:40,398
Just a minute.

664
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:41,432
Look, I don't want

665
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:42,533
to fight.

666
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:43,801
I just want us to enjoy our

667
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:44,669
time together before you

668
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,937
have to leave.

669
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,505
Now is that so much to ask?

670
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,040
No. Nothing

671
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:49,807
would make me

672
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:54,412
happier.

673
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:55,479
Mm, what's that

674
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:57,915
smell? Whew.

675
00:36:57,949 --> 00:36:58,883
I left a bologna sandwich

676
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:00,651
out on the kitchen counter.

677
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:01,352
Well, it stinks.

678
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,553
Mm-hm.

679
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:05,289
Sorry.

680
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:05,923
Oh, God, I love

681
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:07,391
kissing you.

682
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:14,332
Hmm, me, too.

683
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,335
What?

684
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:19,904
What?

685
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:21,839
I have an idea.

686
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:23,441
Oh, no.

687
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:24,075
What has that little brain

688
00:37:24,108 --> 00:37:24,976
of yours come up with

689
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:26,577
this time?

690
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:27,378
It's just something I

691
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,014
want to try.

692
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:33,918
What?

693
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:34,552
Have you ever heard of a

694
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:39,056
thing called 'submission'?

695
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,091
Well, I thought that's

696
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:40,858
what I was doing every time

697
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:42,860
I opened my legs.

698
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:43,594
Is that what it feels

699
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:45,630
like to you?

700
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:47,932
Sometimes.

701
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:48,599
But did you ever think

702
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:49,967
there might be a little bit

703
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:51,369
more to sex than just

704
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:54,472
opening your legs?

705
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:56,707
I just want to make love.

706
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:59,677
So, hmm, what could be

707
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,811
more loving than having me

708
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:04,415
take total control?

709
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,054
Okay.

710
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:10,755
Just make sure it

711
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:11,756
doesn't hurt.

712
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:12,790
It's not going to hurt.

713
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:13,357
And it doesn't make me

714
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:14,392
feel degraded, either.

715
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:18,763
Will you stop worrying?

716
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:19,797
Oh, God, Ted, I just want

717
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:22,333
to make you happy.

718
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:34,679
Goddamnit!

719
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:36,547
I hope you're having fun,

720
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,915
'cause I'm not.

721
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:39,016
All right.

722
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,051
All right.

723
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:43,120
All right, don't talk.

724
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:43,654
Don't move.

725
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:44,855
Don't even breathe.

726
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:45,923
What?

727
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:46,557
What, you can't

728
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,025
pretend that you are dead?

729
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:48,859
You serious?

730
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:50,528
Yes, I'm serious!

731
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:51,095
Just give it a

732
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:51,996
fucking try, okay?

733
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:52,797
Okay! I love

734
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,864
you, Ted, and if

735
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:55,399
that's what you want-

736
00:38:55,433 --> 00:39:00,504
I want it.

737
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:02,440
Do it.

738
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:05,109
Okay, open your eyes.

739
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:08,713
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

740
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:11,649
Fuck ... You ... Bitch!

741
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:14,418
Fuck ... You ... Bitch!

742
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:17,121
Aah ... Aah ... Aah ...

743
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:20,791
... Aah ... Aaah ...

744
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,444
Hi. Excuse me.

745
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:41,712
I'm uh, sorry to bother you,

746
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:43,180
but, uh, I was wondering if

747
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,516
you could help me out.

748
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:48,052
Help you out with what?

749
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:51,989
Uh, with my sailboat I

750
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:54,091
hate asking, but, uh, I

751
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:55,593
basically can't do anything

752
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:59,130
with this cast.

753
00:39:59,163 --> 00:39:59,997
I'll take you for a ride in

754
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,566
it, if you'd like.

755
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:06,137
Please? Pretty please?

756
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,005
Okay. Okay.

757
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:09,673
Just don't beg.

758
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:12,610
Sure. It's,

759
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:13,644
uh, right over

760
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:15,780
this way.

761
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:16,614
I'm Ted.

762
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:17,181
What's your name?

763
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:18,015
Shawn.

764
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:20,518
Hi, shawn.

765
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:27,825
H-hey!

766
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:28,392
I thought you needed help

767
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,761
unloading your sailboat.

768
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:31,695
Yeah, it's at my folk's

769
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:32,797
place just up the hill.

770
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,132
Didn't I mention that?

771
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:36,734
No.

772
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,904
Well, is that a problem?

773
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:40,838
Mm, I guess not.

774
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:44,175
Great. Hop in.

775
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:54,185
Don't touch me!

776
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:54,819
You know what?

777
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:55,820
I hope you're not going to

778
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:56,720
act like this all day

779
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:57,655
If you don't start with

780
00:40:57,688 --> 00:40:59,089
me, I'll be fine.

781
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,558
I, uh, are you on the

782
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:01,225
rag or something?

783
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:05,229
Shut up!

784
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:09,533
Goddamn lemmings.

785
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:10,201
Look at them all.

786
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:10,935
They fester like a bunch

787
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,236
of rats.

788
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:13,170
If they're all rats and

789
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:14,205
lemmings, then what does

790
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:19,543
that make us?

791
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:23,214
I like how you make me do

792
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:25,015
all the work.

793
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:25,683
Hey, I brought the

794
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:26,717
cooler down.

795
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:30,688
Whatever.

796
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:33,224
Where is everybody?

797
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:34,692
They could be anywhere.

798
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:35,659
Well, shouldn't we go

799
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:37,828
look far them?

800
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:39,196
Right now, I just want

801
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,599
to drink my beer.

802
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,667
Fine.

803
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:44,235
Wh-whoa, where do you

804
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:45,703
think you're going?

805
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:48,105
I gotta pee.

806
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:50,608
Is that okay, your lordship?

807
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:53,577
Jesus.

808
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:01,318
Excuse me.

809
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,586
Uh, I'm sorry to bother you,

810
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,854
but is there any chance you

811
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:04,622
could help me out with

812
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:05,589
something?

813
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:07,825
Help you out with what?

814
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,593
Well, with my sailboat.

815
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:10,861
Urn, see, I'm having

816
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:12,129
trouble, uh, unloading it

817
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:13,864
with this stupid cast here,

818
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:14,999
and I'd really appreciate it

819
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:19,136
if you'd give me a hand.

820
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:49,900
(screaming)

821
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:51,769
Okay, that was a

822
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:57,174
mistake, bitch.

823
00:42:57,207 --> 00:43:01,612
I'll be right back, kitten.

824
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:06,810
(screaming)

825
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:12,983
Hi, again.

826
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:16,987
(screaming)

827
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:35,005
Get off!

828
00:44:59,897 --> 00:45:06,837
(screaming)

829
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:07,337
Are you ready for some

830
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:10,908
fun, kitten?

831
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,079
Give me that.

832
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:21,452
Thank you, munchkin.

833
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:30,327
Well, guess this is it.

834
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,361
Won't be seeing you for a

835
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:32,930
while, little one.

836
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:34,331
I don't want you to go.

837
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:35,232
When you're here, it's like

838
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:36,567
we're a family.

839
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,434
Yeah, but I gotta go to

840
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:38,368
college so I can become a

841
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,536
lawyer and buy lots of nice

842
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,338
things for you and mommy.

843
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:42,139
Will you still come

844
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:42,840
see us?

845
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:43,540
Mm-hm.

846
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:44,241
And you can come visit

847
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:45,075
me, too.

848
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:46,176
In Utah?

849
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:52,149
You got it.

850
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:54,084
You be good, okay, munchkin?

851
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:56,120
All right.

852
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:10,501
This is it.

853
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:12,169
Call me, okay?

854
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:14,171
As soon as I get settled.

855
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:21,512
See you in the funny papers.

856
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:40,397
We just found a

857
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,566
third body.

858
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:43,267
What kind of shape's

859
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,134
this one in?

860
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:44,868
They're all skeletonized.

861
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:45,936
Nothing good.

862
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:46,436
Seven heads and

863
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,938
three bodies.

864
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,239
Jesus!

865
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:26,944
Thanks for the ride.

866
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:28,212
I really appreciate it.

867
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:30,914
Sure.

868
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:32,316
Where're you headed?

869
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,650
Silver canyon.

870
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:34,518
How 'bout you?

871
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:39,223
Me, too are you from

872
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:41,091
around here?

873
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:43,493
No. Holy shit.

874
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:48,565
Look at that.

875
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:01,178
(screams)

876
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,357
Fuck ... You!

877
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,691
Fuck ... You!

878
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:18,295
Fuck...

879
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:50,260
Fuck ... You ... Bitch

880
00:48:50,294 --> 00:48:56,600
fuck ... Fuck fuck ... Fuck

881
00:48:58,201 --> 00:48:59,136
Excuse me, ma'am.

882
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:01,305
Ma'am. I'm

883
00:49:01,338 --> 00:49:02,005
Officer Roseland with

884
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:02,673
the Murray police department.

885
00:49:02,706 --> 00:49:03,240
I'm sorry to bother you, but

886
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:03,807
it looks like somebody's

887
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,409
broken into your car.

888
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:06,376
What?

889
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:07,311
Yeah, I'm sorry, ma'am,

890
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:08,045
you're going to have to come

891
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:09,212
with me.

892
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:09,680
Do you have any

893
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:10,314
identification?

894
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:11,315
I mean...

895
00:49:11,348 --> 00:49:14,384
Ma'am.

896
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:15,052
I mean, how did you know

897
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:16,320
it was my car?

898
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:17,054
Well, what kind of a car

899
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:17,688
do you drive?

900
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:18,689
Green imperial.

901
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:19,589
I'm sorry, but that's

902
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:20,390
the one.

903
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:20,957
Fuck!

904
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:21,591
Mom's gonna kill me if

905
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:28,298
anything happened to that.

906
00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:28,966
It's still locked.

907
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:30,133
It hasn't even been touched.

908
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:30,767
I'm afraid I'm going to

909
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:31,201
have to ask you to file a

910
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:32,436
report, ma'am.

911
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:33,203
But there is nothing to

912
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:34,037
report. Its fine.

913
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:34,671
Our sub-station's just

914
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:35,639
around the corner here.

915
00:49:35,672 --> 00:49:36,506
This is so stupid!

916
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:37,240
You have, like, the wrong

917
00:49:37,274 --> 00:49:38,442
car or something!

918
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:39,209
Its for your own

919
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:41,411
protection, ma'am.

920
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:42,713
Your station's back here?

921
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:43,513
Oh, it's a

922
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:44,181
substation, ma'am.

923
00:49:44,214 --> 00:49:46,049
It's really just an office.

924
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:46,683
Our headquarters is a few

925
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:48,118
blocks from here.

926
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:48,785
Well, I hope it smells

927
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:51,188
better than this.

928
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:51,588
I assure you, ma'am,

929
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:53,056
it does.

930
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:53,457
We're just to the

931
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:57,794
right, here.

932
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:00,764
Damn, it's locked.

933
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:01,531
My partner must have already

934
00:50:01,565 --> 00:50:03,734
taken the guy in.

935
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:05,302
What guy?

936
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:05,736
The one who broke into

937
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:06,603
your car.

938
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:07,671
But nobody broke into my

939
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:08,338
car, so

940
00:50:08,372 --> 00:50:09,439
Sorry, ma'am, I'm going to

941
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:10,240
have to ask you to accompany

942
00:50:10,273 --> 00:50:11,241
me to the station.

943
00:50:11,274 --> 00:50:12,175
In this?

944
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:12,709
Its the dumbest looking cop

945
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:13,677
car I've ever seen.

946
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:14,544
It's a civilian car,

947
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:15,345
ma'am. Department

948
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:16,113
budget only goes

949
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:16,613
so far.

950
00:50:16,646 --> 00:50:22,085
Oh, great.

951
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:35,766
The police station's not

952
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:39,770
over this way.

953
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,574
What the fuck are you

954
00:50:44,608 --> 00:50:49,112
doing? Fuck!

955
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:50,380
What the fuck are you doing?

956
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:52,582
What the fuck are you doing?

957
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:56,319
You son-of-a-bitch!

958
00:50:56,353 --> 00:51:01,224
Kill you ... The fuck ...

959
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:07,764
Oh, fuck. Fuck.

960
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:14,571
I'm gonna fuckin'

961
00:51:14,604 --> 00:51:18,141
kill you!

962
00:51:22,846 --> 00:51:24,481
Don't fucking move or I

963
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:26,450
will blow your head off!

964
00:51:26,483 --> 00:51:27,818
You hear me?

965
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:30,153
Yes.

966
00:51:30,187 --> 00:51:30,687
Are you gonna be a good

967
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,722
little girl?

968
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:33,457
Yes.

969
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:34,157
Huh?

970
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:38,829
Yes!

971
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:41,531
Fuck.

972
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:43,733
Jesus.

973
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,635
Fucker!

974
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:48,905
Uuhh!

975
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:52,509
Fuck.

976
00:52:14,998 --> 00:52:16,199
God!

977
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:19,469
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

978
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:22,539
Ted, don't mess around!

979
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:27,944
Ted, hit her in the head!

980
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:50,500
Bye.

981
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:52,435
See ya later.

982
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:55,372
Hey.

983
00:52:55,405 --> 00:52:56,907
Oh, my God!

984
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,842
You scared me to death.

985
00:52:58,875 --> 00:52:59,543
Here, let me get that

986
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:00,544
for you.

987
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:02,279
Oh, thank you.

988
00:53:02,312 --> 00:53:04,548
That's so sweet.

989
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:06,316
Don't mention it.

990
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:06,783
Wow, you're just a kid,

991
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:07,784
aren't you?

992
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:08,218
No, I'm actually

993
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:10,787
almost eighteen.

994
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:11,354
I didn't mean to insult

995
00:53:11,388 --> 00:53:14,391
you, it's just ... No,

996
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:18,662
forget it.

997
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:20,664
Wait.

998
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:22,299
I'm sorry.

999
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:22,866
I didn't mean to sound like

1000
00:53:22,899 --> 00:53:24,568
such a bitch.

1001
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:25,135
I just, you know, I don't

1002
00:53:25,168 --> 00:53:26,536
like when people say I'm

1003
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:27,370
like some kind of baby or

1004
00:53:27,404 --> 00:53:29,272
anything.

1005
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:30,507
That's okay, kid.

1006
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,309
Forget it.

1007
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:32,909
Boy, you're batting a

1008
00:53:32,943 --> 00:53:35,812
thousand, aren't you?

1009
00:53:35,845 --> 00:53:36,980
Look, I'm sorry.

1010
00:53:37,013 --> 00:53:38,949
Don't mean to be a jerk.

1011
00:53:38,982 --> 00:53:39,816
It's just that when I first

1012
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:40,550
saw you, I got kinda

1013
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:42,852
turned on.

1014
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:43,954
But now that I can see how

1015
00:53:43,987 --> 00:53:45,589
young you are no offense

1016
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:48,725
intended there either, but

1017
00:53:48,758 --> 00:53:49,593
well, let's just say that

1018
00:53:49,626 --> 00:53:50,427
I'm too old for you and

1019
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,596
leave it at that.

1020
00:53:52,629 --> 00:53:53,597
Well, you may be too old

1021
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:54,831
for me, but that still

1022
00:53:54,864 --> 00:53:58,368
doesn't make me a kid.

1023
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:03,673
Good point.

1024
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:28,531
Another one?

1025
00:54:28,565 --> 00:54:34,738
All right.

1026
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:36,740
Oh, boy, look at this!

1027
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:38,408
Oh, is it a boy or girl?

1028
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:39,609
It's a girl.

1029
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:40,543
We know.

1030
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:41,177
You must have been a

1031
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:41,611
really good girl for Santa

1032
00:54:41,645 --> 00:54:42,045
to bring you all

1033
00:54:42,078 --> 00:54:43,079
these presents.

1034
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,547
Uh-huh, I was.

1035
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:46,750
Okay, well, let's see

1036
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:47,884
what's next.

1037
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:50,887
Why don't you try this one?

1038
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,527
Oh, my gosh!

1039
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:58,361
We know.

1040
00:54:58,395 --> 00:54:59,562
Just what you needed!

1041
00:54:59,596 --> 00:55:00,363
Thank you!

1042
00:55:00,397 --> 00:55:04,067
You're welcome.

1043
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:16,513
Hello?

1044
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:19,749
Hello?

1045
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:21,651
Hello?

1046
00:55:21,685 --> 00:55:23,386
Jesus mister. What is

1047
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:23,787
it, your heart or

1048
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:27,691
something?

1049
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:07,831
(siren)

1050
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:53,743
Hey, I'm sorry, officer-

1051
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:55,011
You stop right there

1052
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:55,845
I didn't see you back-

1053
00:56:55,879 --> 00:56:56,880
Now!

1054
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:57,614
Put your hands above

1055
00:56:57,647 --> 00:57:00,016
your head!

1056
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:00,750
Okay.

1057
00:57:00,784 --> 00:57:01,684
No problem.

1058
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:03,720
Turn around!

1059
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:05,922
Put your hands on your head.

1060
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:09,859
All right.

1061
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:13,563
Okay. You don't

1062
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:14,063
need to explain

1063
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:14,631
the law to me.

1064
00:57:14,664 --> 00:57:16,232
I-I go to law school.

1065
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,167
Yeah we checked that

1066
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,835
out, and you sure do.

1067
00:57:18,868 --> 00:57:19,402
And I worked on the

1068
00:57:19,435 --> 00:57:20,136
"Thompson for governor"

1069
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:20,703
campaign. You

1070
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:22,605
can ask him about me.

1071
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:23,673
A law student active

1072
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:25,508
in politics.

1073
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:26,142
But what's a groovy guy like

1074
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:27,043
you driving around with a

1075
00:57:27,076 --> 00:57:28,244
rape kit in his car?

1076
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:29,078
Look, I told you, it's not

1077
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:31,181
a rape kit.

1078
00:57:31,214 --> 00:57:31,748
I can explain to you every

1079
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:32,782
single thing you found

1080
00:57:32,816 --> 00:57:33,650
in there.

1081
00:57:33,683 --> 00:57:35,185
I don't know, Ted.

1082
00:57:35,218 --> 00:57:36,586
A nylon stocking mask with

1083
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:38,922
eye slits, a hacksaw, a

1084
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:40,123
crowbar with duct tape

1085
00:57:40,156 --> 00:57:41,558
around the handle, a knife,

1086
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:42,792
a rope, handcuffs.

1087
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:44,127
Lock-picking tools?

1088
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,929
So far you haven't

1089
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:47,063
explained anything.

1090
00:57:47,096 --> 00:57:47,597
I think I've explained

1091
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:49,532
things pretty well.

1092
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:50,166
Well, let me ask you

1093
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,169
something else, okay, Ted?

1094
00:57:53,203 --> 00:57:54,070
Look, it's your show.

1095
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:54,838
Dig it.

1096
00:57:54,871 --> 00:57:56,239
Knock yourself out.

1097
00:57:56,272 --> 00:57:57,907
Great.

1098
00:57:57,941 --> 00:57:59,876
So, urn, you ever hear of a

1099
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:04,781
girl named Tina Gabler?

1100
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:08,151
No.

1101
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:08,818
Well, that's funny.

1102
00:58:08,852 --> 00:58:09,485
She saw your picture and she

1103
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:10,753
insists that you're the guy

1104
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:11,421
that tried to kidnap her

1105
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:12,121
from the mall the couple of

1106
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:12,655
months ago.

1107
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:14,090
Well, she's wrong.

1108
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:14,724
Well, you wouldn't mind

1109
00:58:14,757 --> 00:58:15,592
standing in a lineup then,

1110
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:19,128
would you?

1111
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:19,796
You're wasting your time,

1112
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:20,830
but if it'll make you happy,

1113
00:58:20,864 --> 00:58:22,565
go ahead.

1114
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:23,199
Look, why don't we get

1115
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:24,567
back to that stuff later?

1116
00:58:24,601 --> 00:58:25,235
I'm going to read you a list

1117
00:58:25,268 --> 00:58:26,102
of names and see if any of

1118
00:58:26,135 --> 00:58:27,270
them ring a bell, okay?

1119
00:58:27,303 --> 00:58:28,204
Look-

1120
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:29,739
Just shut up.

1121
00:58:29,772 --> 00:58:32,108
Okay, Ted, listen.

1122
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:36,579
Barbara Vincennes, Karen

1123
00:58:36,613 --> 00:58:41,784
Stills, Suzanne Welch,

1124
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:43,853
Karen Parks?

1125
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:45,188
Brenda Ball?

1126
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:46,656
Patricia Garber?

1127
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:47,357
Miriam Cutler?

1128
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:49,325
Shawn Randall?

1129
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:50,260
Lucy Lee?

1130
00:58:50,293 --> 00:58:51,661
Melissa Smith?

1131
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:52,629
Wendy Fit?

1132
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:53,930
Anita Mintier?

1133
00:58:53,963 --> 00:58:55,231
Stephanie Merkson?

1134
00:58:55,265 --> 00:58:56,966
Ellen Carter?

1135
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,167
Betsy Walter?

1136
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,135
Lynn Adams?

1137
00:58:59,168 --> 00:59:00,069
You never heard of any of

1138
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:03,339
these women?

1139
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:03,873
Look, I don't like the

1140
00:59:03,907 --> 00:59:06,009
tone of your voice.

1141
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:09,679
This interview's over.

1142
00:59:43,813 --> 00:59:45,815
My dearest Lee.

1143
00:59:45,848 --> 00:59:46,749
I feel my heart is going to

1144
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:47,317
break as I write

1145
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:49,786
this letter.

1146
00:59:49,819 --> 00:59:50,653
Here I sit in a cage like

1147
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:52,989
some kind of animal.

1148
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:53,823
So much for the humanity

1149
00:59:53,856 --> 00:59:56,125
of mankind.

1150
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:57,193
The so-called authorities

1151
00:59:57,226 --> 00:59:58,227
are continuing to persecute

1152
00:59:58,261 --> 00:59:59,295
me, even though their case

1153
00:59:59,329 --> 01:00:02,031
is a total joke.

1154
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:03,066
They act like I'm supposed

1155
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:03,967
to be remorseful, even

1156
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:04,834
though I've done nothing to

1157
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:08,071
feel remorseful for.

1158
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:10,807
Maybe its all for the better

1159
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:11,407
'cause it makes me

1160
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:12,308
appreciate our love all

1161
01:00:12,342 --> 01:00:14,243
the more.

1162
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:14,877
For even if I'm locked in a

1163
01:00:14,911 --> 01:00:16,346
cage, I think of the love

1164
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:17,447
that we have and I am able

1165
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:18,915
to be free, if only for

1166
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:21,317
a moment.

1167
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:22,118
I know I haven't always

1168
01:00:22,151 --> 01:00:22,785
treated you the way you

1169
01:00:22,819 --> 01:00:23,987
deserve, but I'm only a man

1170
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:26,289
and sometimes it's just

1171
01:00:26,322 --> 01:00:28,891
so hard.

1172
01:00:28,925 --> 01:00:29,792
But all that melts in the

1173
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:31,027
face of the love as strong

1174
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:36,065
as the love I feel for you.

1175
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:39,369
Ever lovin', Ted.

1176
01:00:43,339 --> 01:00:49,012
(sobs.)

1177
01:00:49,045 --> 01:00:49,979
I want to talk to

1178
01:00:50,013 --> 01:00:50,713
you about something.

1179
01:00:50,747 --> 01:00:51,748
Sure.

1180
01:00:51,781 --> 01:00:52,382
Please don't think that

1181
01:00:52,415 --> 01:00:53,416
I'm trying to add to your

1182
01:00:53,449 --> 01:00:54,717
problems here okay?

1183
01:00:54,751 --> 01:00:55,318
I mean, I know you've got a

1184
01:00:55,351 --> 01:00:56,986
lot on your mind lately.

1185
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:58,721
Okay?

1186
01:00:58,755 --> 01:00:59,856
Okay?

1187
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:00,990
And-and the years that we've

1188
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:01,991
been together, I have been

1189
01:01:02,025 --> 01:01:02,992
completely faithful to you,

1190
01:01:03,026 --> 01:01:03,659
an honor that I know you

1191
01:01:03,693 --> 01:01:05,495
haven't always reciprocated.

1192
01:01:05,528 --> 01:01:07,063
Even here in prison, I've

1193
01:01:07,096 --> 01:01:08,131
been willing to give you the

1194
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:09,132
benefit of the doubt.

1195
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:10,266
But when I hear on TV that

1196
01:01:10,299 --> 01:01:12,135
you've got some girlfriend

1197
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:13,136
coming visiting you, that's

1198
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:14,137
when I have to ask myself

1199
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:17,807
what am I doing here?

1200
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:18,241
Is that what this

1201
01:01:18,274 --> 01:01:20,743
is about?

1202
01:01:20,777 --> 01:01:21,310
Look, Lee, that woman is

1203
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:22,445
working for me.

1204
01:01:22,478 --> 01:01:23,179
She's trying to get me

1205
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:24,414
outta here.

1206
01:01:24,447 --> 01:01:25,148
I'm in prison, for

1207
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:25,782
Christ's sake.

1208
01:01:25,815 --> 01:01:26,416
I can't control what they

1209
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:29,385
say on TV.

1210
01:01:29,419 --> 01:01:30,186
Lee, honey-

1211
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:31,054
No!

1212
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:32,989
No more 'Lee, honey'!

1213
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:35,324
Now you tell me right now,

1214
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:36,893
is that woman your

1215
01:01:36,926 --> 01:01:40,363
girlfriend?

1216
01:01:40,396 --> 01:01:41,964
No. You're

1217
01:01:41,998 --> 01:01:47,203
my girlfriend, Lee.

1218
01:01:47,236 --> 01:01:47,870
Now there's something I need

1219
01:01:47,904 --> 01:01:50,373
to tell you.

1220
01:01:50,406 --> 01:01:53,009
Okay.

1221
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:56,179
I'm being charged again.

1222
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:57,313
What?

1223
01:01:57,346 --> 01:02:00,083
For some girl's murder.

1224
01:02:00,116 --> 01:02:02,218
Some girl?

1225
01:02:02,251 --> 01:02:02,952
Yeah, but their case is

1226
01:02:02,985 --> 01:02:03,519
totally weak.

1227
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:04,153
They will never get a

1228
01:02:04,187 --> 01:02:05,154
conviction.

1229
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:23,172
Oh, my God.

1230
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:33,983
Oh, my God. No.

1231
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:36,252
Lee...

1232
01:02:36,285 --> 01:02:40,123
Lee!

1233
01:02:40,156 --> 01:02:42,492
Get me outta here.

1234
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:46,462
Lee.

1235
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:49,365
Theodore Robert Bundy

1236
01:02:49,398 --> 01:02:50,433
was taken from his cell in

1237
01:02:50,466 --> 01:02:51,534
Colorado state prison and

1238
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:53,236
brought to Aspen, where he

1239
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:54,237
will stand trial for the

1240
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:55,972
murder of Terry Bell whom

1241
01:02:56,005 --> 01:02:56,839
authorities claim was

1242
01:02:56,873 --> 01:02:57,907
abducted from the Pinewood

1243
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:02,912
ski resort last Christmas.

1244
01:03:05,314 --> 01:03:05,948
All right, Ted, las get

1245
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:07,917
these chains off you buddy.

1246
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:09,252
All right, Randy. Thanks.

1247
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:09,685
You seem kind of excited

1248
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:11,254
this morning.

1249
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:12,021
Cooking up something for

1250
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:13,089
your defense, huh?

1251
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:15,391
Yeah, I got a few ideas.

1252
01:03:15,424 --> 01:03:16,125
Lets get the legs off

1253
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:17,260
real quick.

1254
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:18,528
Hey, Randy.

1255
01:03:18,561 --> 01:03:19,162
Yeah, Ted, what's

1256
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:20,530
goin' on?

1257
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:21,998
Why do women wear makeup

1258
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:23,332
and use perfume?

1259
01:03:23,366 --> 01:03:24,534
I don't know.

1260
01:03:24,567 --> 01:03:25,868
Why, Ted?

1261
01:03:25,902 --> 01:03:26,569
Because they're ugly and

1262
01:03:26,602 --> 01:03:31,274
they stink.

1263
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:31,841
For your sake, I sure

1264
01:03:31,874 --> 01:03:32,875
hope you've thought this

1265
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:34,110
through.

1266
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,912
You know the old saying:

1267
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:36,479
An attorney that represents

1268
01:03:36,512 --> 01:03:37,180
himself has a fool for

1269
01:03:37,213 --> 01:03:38,247
a client

1270
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:39,982
Yeah, that's what

1271
01:03:40,016 --> 01:03:41,050
I've heard.

1272
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:41,951
Thanks, man.

1273
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:43,119
Good luck now buddy.

1274
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:49,559
Thank you

1275
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:54,263
Hey, Ted.

1276
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:55,198
I'm gonna have a smoke in

1277
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:56,232
the hall, okay?

1278
01:03:56,265 --> 01:03:58,968
Okay.

1279
01:04:40,109 --> 01:04:44,914
Bastard!

1280
01:04:45,648 --> 01:04:46,182
Bundy's loose!

1281
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:48,317
I repeat, Bundy's loose!

1282
01:04:48,351 --> 01:04:50,486
Bundy's loose!

1283
01:04:54,523 --> 01:04:55,124
Bundy jumped out of this

1284
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:56,525
second story window at the

1285
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:57,493
front of the Pitkin County

1286
01:04:57,526 --> 01:04:58,961
courthouse this morning.

1287
01:04:58,995 --> 01:05:00,062
Witnesses say he left in

1288
01:05:00,096 --> 01:05:00,730
a hurry.

1289
01:05:00,763 --> 01:05:01,530
However, nobody saw him open

1290
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:02,698
the window.

1291
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:04,367
And he escaped clean

1292
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,103
in an unknown direction

1293
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:33,996
(screams)

1294
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:36,632
Oh, my God!

1295
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:37,533
Oh, my God!

1296
01:05:37,566 --> 01:05:38,067
Oh, my God!

1297
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:39,568
This is so terrible!

1298
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:40,236
It's okay.

1299
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:41,304
Oh, God.

1300
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:42,338
How could I do it?

1301
01:05:42,371 --> 01:05:43,105
You didn't know.

1302
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:44,106
How could I have ever

1303
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:45,207
touched him?

1304
01:05:45,241 --> 01:05:46,108
Ssh.

1305
01:05:46,142 --> 01:05:46,742
It's okay.

1306
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,010
Oh, my God!

1307
01:05:48,044 --> 01:05:51,414
Oh, my God!

1308
01:06:09,598 --> 01:06:10,700
Hi, Ted.

1309
01:06:10,733 --> 01:06:14,103
Welcome back.

1310
01:06:45,101 --> 01:06:48,070
Ooh.

1311
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:58,481
Oh, God.

1312
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:02,518
Oh, Ted.

1313
01:07:37,853 --> 01:07:38,487
If I didn't have this

1314
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:39,021
visit to look forward to, I

1315
01:07:39,054 --> 01:07:41,457
think I'd go insane.

1316
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:42,658
I-I tried to come last

1317
01:07:42,691 --> 01:07:43,526
week, but you know, with

1318
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:44,393
Christmas and all, I just

1319
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:45,494
couldn't find the time.

1320
01:07:45,528 --> 01:07:47,396
No, it's okay.

1321
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:47,863
Did you get the money

1322
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:48,664
I sent?

1323
01:07:48,697 --> 01:07:51,467
yeah. Thanks.

1324
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:52,835
I'm going to pay you back.

1325
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:55,137
I know you will.

1326
01:07:55,171 --> 01:07:55,671
Just as soon as we get you

1327
01:07:55,704 --> 01:07:58,240
out of this place.

1328
01:07:58,274 --> 01:08:00,810
Yeah.

1329
01:08:00,843 --> 01:08:03,145
We'll see. They

1330
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:06,682
want to kill me.

1331
01:08:06,715 --> 01:08:07,683
What are you

1332
01:08:07,716 --> 01:08:08,250
talking about?

1333
01:08:08,284 --> 01:08:09,718
Who wants to kill you?

1334
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:10,486
They're moving my trial to

1335
01:08:10,519 --> 01:08:12,421
Colorado Springs.

1336
01:08:12,455 --> 01:08:14,256
I don't understand

1337
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:14,690
They're asking for the

1338
01:08:14,723 --> 01:08:16,926
death penalty.

1339
01:08:16,959 --> 01:08:17,693
They don't think they've got

1340
01:08:17,726 --> 01:08:18,127
justice unless they

1341
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:19,829
kill somebody.

1342
01:08:19,862 --> 01:08:20,563
But their case is

1343
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:21,497
so weak.

1344
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:22,331
They framed me once, they

1345
01:08:22,364 --> 01:08:24,266
can frame me again

1346
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:26,702
Okay, Bundy, wrap it up.

1347
01:08:26,735 --> 01:08:28,471
Okay.

1348
01:08:28,504 --> 01:08:30,506
Look, I'm sorry.

1349
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:31,173
I haven't seen you in two

1350
01:08:31,207 --> 01:08:31,607
weeks, and here I am talking

1351
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:34,577
about myself.

1352
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:35,077
How are you?

1353
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:37,246
How was Christmas

1354
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:37,880
Oh, it was good.

1355
01:08:37,913 --> 01:08:40,583
I liked seeing my parents.

1356
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:41,183
What they must think

1357
01:08:41,217 --> 01:08:42,718
of me.

1358
01:08:42,751 --> 01:08:45,354
Don't worry about it.

1359
01:08:45,387 --> 01:08:46,555
I'm here and I love

1360
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:48,724
you, buddy.

1361
01:08:48,757 --> 01:08:51,760
And soon ... Very soon we're

1362
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:54,763
going to be together, okay?

1363
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:55,531
Yeah

1364
01:08:55,564 --> 01:08:56,332
Come on, Bundy.

1365
01:08:56,365 --> 01:08:59,335
Let's go

1366
01:09:05,241 --> 01:09:05,774
Whatever happens, just

1367
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:07,877
know that I love you.

1368
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:09,845
I love you.

1369
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:38,641
Theodore Robert Bundy,

1370
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:39,642
believed by authorities to

1371
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:40,476
be the worst mass

1372
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:41,477
murderer in U.S.

1373
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:42,611
History, and who some

1374
01:09:42,645 --> 01:09:43,646
investigators are saying is

1375
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:44,880
responsible for up to one

1376
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:46,515
hundred and fifty brutal sex

1377
01:09:46,549 --> 01:09:47,650
murders throughout

1378
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:48,684
the country.

1379
01:09:48,717 --> 01:09:49,818
Has escaped from custody for

1380
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:51,954
the second time.

1381
01:09:51,987 --> 01:09:52,988
One detective familiar with

1382
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:54,256
the case is warning the

1383
01:09:54,290 --> 01:09:55,291
public that Bundy should be

1384
01:09:55,324 --> 01:09:56,292
considered extremely

1385
01:09:56,325 --> 01:09:57,927
dangerous and that it's only

1386
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,361
a matter of time before he

1387
01:09:59,395 --> 01:10:03,599
kills again.

1388
01:10:13,676 --> 01:10:15,711
Lord have mercy.

1389
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:17,046
Listen, mister, whatever

1390
01:10:17,079 --> 01:10:17,813
you're selling, I

1391
01:10:17,846 --> 01:10:20,282
ain't buying.

1392
01:10:20,316 --> 01:10:20,816
I'm here about the ad in

1393
01:10:20,849 --> 01:10:21,617
the paper.

1394
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:22,284
You still got that room

1395
01:10:22,318 --> 01:10:22,918
for rent?

1396
01:10:22,952 --> 01:10:23,586
No offense, but you don't

1397
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:24,720
look like you'd know what to

1398
01:10:24,753 --> 01:10:25,854
do with a room if n you

1399
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:28,357
had one.

1400
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:28,958
I got money.

1401
01:10:28,991 --> 01:10:30,492
Right here.

1402
01:10:30,526 --> 01:10:32,494
Mama!

1403
01:10:32,528 --> 01:10:34,597
Mama!

1404
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:35,164
All right!

1405
01:10:35,197 --> 01:10:35,664
What the hell are you

1406
01:10:35,698 --> 01:10:37,032
carrying on about?

1407
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:39,835
Mama, this here is...

1408
01:10:39,868 --> 01:10:41,604
Chris hagen.

1409
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:44,440
Mama, this here's Chris.

1410
01:10:44,473 --> 01:10:45,441
And he'd like to rent

1411
01:10:45,474 --> 01:10:46,609
a room.

1412
01:10:46,642 --> 01:10:47,476
He gives me his word he

1413
01:10:47,509 --> 01:10:50,779
can pay

1414
01:10:50,813 --> 01:10:52,448
Hell, I'd give a dog the

1415
01:10:52,481 --> 01:10:53,549
best room in the house 'he

1416
01:10:53,582 --> 01:10:54,316
had the money to pay for

1417
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:58,020
it. Cash.

1418
01:10:58,053 --> 01:11:00,623
Yes, ma'am.

1419
01:11:00,656 --> 01:11:02,424
You won't regret it.

1420
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:03,626
Yeah.

1421
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:04,460
And don't be botherin'

1422
01:11:04,493 --> 01:11:07,696
me anymore.

1423
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:33,622
I couldn't believe it.

1424
01:11:33,656 --> 01:11:34,256
I mean, I know we haven't

1425
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:35,424
been dating that long, but

1426
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:36,825
I, at least, expect him to

1427
01:11:36,859 --> 01:11:37,526
buy me something

1428
01:11:37,559 --> 01:11:38,494
for Christmas.

1429
01:11:38,527 --> 01:11:38,961
He didn't give

1430
01:11:38,994 --> 01:11:39,428
you anything?

1431
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:40,429
Sure he gave me

1432
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:41,430
something.

1433
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:41,997
The only thing he's been

1434
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:42,631
trying to give me all

1435
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:44,400
year long.

1436
01:11:44,433 --> 01:11:44,833
What are you

1437
01:11:44,867 --> 01:11:45,634
talking about?

1438
01:11:45,668 --> 01:11:47,903
You know what I mean.

1439
01:11:47,936 --> 01:11:50,906
No, I don't.

1440
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:51,473
Tell you what, a few more

1441
01:11:51,507 --> 01:11:52,141
of those and I will just

1442
01:11:52,174 --> 01:11:54,610
tell you all about it, girl.

1443
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:55,611
Good evening, ladies.

1444
01:11:55,644 --> 01:11:56,145
How would you like to help

1445
01:11:56,178 --> 01:11:57,479
me finish my pitcher

1446
01:11:57,513 --> 01:11:58,047
of beer?

1447
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:58,814
We love being helpful

1448
01:11:58,847 --> 01:11:59,948
Great.

1449
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:01,050
I'm Chris

1450
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:01,984
Hi, Chris.

1451
01:12:02,017 --> 01:12:02,785
I'm Vicky.

1452
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:04,653
This is my sister, Lara.

1453
01:12:04,687 --> 01:12:06,021
Sisters, huh?

1454
01:12:06,055 --> 01:12:07,556
Sorority sisters.

1455
01:12:07,589 --> 01:12:10,559
Right. So.

1456
01:12:10,592 --> 01:12:11,827
Obvious question I know,

1457
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:12,961
but, uh ... What are

1458
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:14,096
your majors?

1459
01:12:14,129 --> 01:12:14,863
You know, I haven't quite

1460
01:12:14,897 --> 01:12:16,498
decided yet.

1461
01:12:16,532 --> 01:12:18,667
Mine's pre-law.

1462
01:12:18,701 --> 01:12:20,803
Pre-law?

1463
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:21,403
That's a total waste

1464
01:12:21,437 --> 01:12:22,938
of time.

1465
01:12:22,971 --> 01:12:23,672
What kind of thing is

1466
01:12:23,706 --> 01:12:25,941
that to say?

1467
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:27,042
You know what?

1468
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:28,811
I'm outta here.

1469
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:29,545
Where are you going?

1470
01:12:29,578 --> 01:12:32,948
See ya.

1471
01:12:32,981 --> 01:12:33,382
I don't think your

1472
01:12:33,415 --> 01:12:35,084
sister likes me.

1473
01:12:35,117 --> 01:12:36,018
No, she's just not really

1474
01:12:36,051 --> 01:12:38,420
good in social situations.

1475
01:12:38,454 --> 01:12:40,055
She'll be all right.

1476
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:44,193
So, are you a teacher here?

1477
01:12:44,226 --> 01:12:46,061
Yeah.

1478
01:12:46,095 --> 01:12:47,062
Yeah, I am.

1479
01:12:47,096 --> 01:12:49,698
If you'll excuse me.

1480
01:12:49,732 --> 01:12:52,868
No excuse.

1481
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:17,059
Wasn't tonight fun?

1482
01:13:17,092 --> 01:13:20,129
Yes.

1483
01:13:20,829 --> 01:13:21,597
(knock at the door)

1484
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:23,165
Come in!

1485
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:23,932
Hey, what are you

1486
01:13:23,966 --> 01:13:24,833
guys doing?

1487
01:13:24,867 --> 01:13:25,467
What does it look like

1488
01:13:25,501 --> 01:13:29,238
we're doing?

1489
01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:30,672
Right.

1490
01:13:30,706 --> 01:13:31,607
I met the biggest creep at

1491
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,809
the bar tonight.

1492
01:13:33,842 --> 01:13:34,410
Ooh.

1493
01:13:34,443 --> 01:13:35,744
Anyway, I just came to

1494
01:13:35,778 --> 01:13:37,613
say good night.

1495
01:13:37,646 --> 01:13:39,548
Okay.

1496
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:40,916
Good night.

1497
01:13:40,949 --> 01:13:43,852
Good night, Lara!

1498
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:09,665
Good night.

1499
01:16:09,698 --> 01:16:14,703
See you tomorrow.

1500
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:27,282
Asshole!

1501
01:16:27,316 --> 01:16:31,920
Jesus.

1502
01:16:35,357 --> 01:16:39,294
(screaming)

1503
01:16:45,834 --> 01:16:48,804
Some fucked up shit.

1504
01:16:56,078 --> 01:16:59,014
How you doin', Randy?

1505
01:16:59,047 --> 01:17:00,949
I tell you what, Chris,

1506
01:17:00,983 --> 01:17:01,750
its a crazy world we're

1507
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:02,684
livin' in.

1508
01:17:02,718 --> 01:17:08,857
No argument there.

1509
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:09,691
Hear about that psycho

1510
01:17:09,725 --> 01:17:11,860
last night?

1511
01:17:11,893 --> 01:17:14,029
Went and killed two girls

1512
01:17:14,062 --> 01:17:15,230
and then beat two others

1513
01:17:15,263 --> 01:17:16,999
half to death.

1514
01:17:17,032 --> 01:17:17,899
L-less than a mile

1515
01:17:17,933 --> 01:17:18,967
from here.

1516
01:17:19,001 --> 01:17:24,239
Yeah, I heard about that.

1517
01:17:24,272 --> 01:17:25,007
Why would somebody do a

1518
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,976
thing like that for?

1519
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:29,277
I wish I knew.

1520
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:34,983
I mean, goddamn.

1521
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:36,918
I guess some people are

1522
01:17:36,952 --> 01:17:38,387
just compelled to kill.

1523
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:39,254
I'm compelled to hit my

1524
01:17:39,287 --> 01:17:40,288
mama over the head just

1525
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:41,256
about everyday, but I don't

1526
01:17:41,289 --> 01:17:43,492
do it, goddamnit.

1527
01:17:43,525 --> 01:17:44,126
But still, you gotta

1528
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:46,261
admire the guy who did it.

1529
01:17:46,294 --> 01:17:47,796
Get in there like that, have

1530
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:48,864
his way with those girls,

1531
01:17:48,897 --> 01:17:50,465
and then get away.

1532
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:51,366
Takes cunning.

1533
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:52,401
And guts.

1534
01:17:52,434 --> 01:17:53,201
I ought to smack you in

1535
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:53,735
the mouth for saying

1536
01:17:53,769 --> 01:17:55,871
something like that!

1537
01:17:55,904 --> 01:17:56,738
I'm just saying, man-

1538
01:17:56,772 --> 01:18:00,008
Aw, fuck you!

1539
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:06,515
You're right, Randy.

1540
01:18:06,548 --> 01:18:09,017
Fuck me.

1541
01:18:29,871 --> 01:18:30,839
Hey, little girl, what's

1542
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:31,907
your name?

1543
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:33,041
Suzanne.

1544
01:18:33,075 --> 01:18:35,043
Suzanne, there's a -

1545
01:18:35,077 --> 01:18:35,477
there's been a bit of an

1546
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:36,044
accident.

1547
01:18:36,078 --> 01:18:37,079
Your father's been hurt.

1548
01:18:37,112 --> 01:18:37,913
My dad?

1549
01:18:37,946 --> 01:18:38,580
Yeah.

1550
01:18:38,613 --> 01:18:38,980
He asked me to come get you.

1551
01:18:39,014 --> 01:18:39,381
Is he okay?

1552
01:18:39,414 --> 01:18:39,981
Where is he?

1553
01:18:40,015 --> 01:18:41,850
Uh, he's close to here.

1554
01:18:41,883 --> 01:18:43,085
Yeah, he's going to be okay.

1555
01:18:43,118 --> 01:18:44,119
Well, what happened?

1556
01:18:44,152 --> 01:18:44,686
Well, he had a little

1557
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:46,254
accident, and here, why

1558
01:18:46,288 --> 01:18:48,356
don't you get in.

1559
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:52,260
Is he okay?

1560
01:18:52,594 --> 01:18:56,264
Uh. Uh...Uh..

1561
01:19:00,268 --> 01:19:03,839
Fuck...Fuck

1562
01:19:08,376 --> 01:19:11,947
Aw... aw...

1563
01:19:12,614 --> 01:19:16,184
(yelling continues)

1564
01:19:23,892 --> 01:19:26,128
God.

1565
01:19:26,161 --> 01:19:29,364
She's dead.

1566
01:19:29,397 --> 01:19:34,136
Oh, I'm coming.

1567
01:20:36,464 --> 01:20:39,467
Please kill me.

1568
01:20:47,242 --> 01:20:47,876
It is further ordered

1569
01:20:47,909 --> 01:20:49,311
that on such scheduled date,

1570
01:20:49,344 --> 01:20:52,047
that you be put to death by

1571
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,049
a current of electricity

1572
01:20:54,082 --> 01:20:55,183
sufficient to cause your

1573
01:20:55,217 --> 01:20:57,452
immediate death.

1574
01:20:57,485 --> 01:20:58,086
And such current of

1575
01:20:58,119 --> 01:20:59,921
electricity shall continue

1576
01:20:59,955 --> 01:21:01,189
to pass through your body

1577
01:21:01,223 --> 01:21:04,326
until you are dead.

1578
01:21:09,231 --> 01:21:09,831
I can tell you that

1579
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:10,498
everything's moving ahead

1580
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:12,033
with plans for the execution

1581
01:21:12,067 --> 01:21:13,468
at seven A.M.

1582
01:21:13,501 --> 01:21:14,469
Bundy was offered a last

1583
01:21:14,502 --> 01:21:15,403
meal about forty

1584
01:21:15,437 --> 01:21:17,038
minutes ago.

1585
01:21:17,072 --> 01:21:18,006
He was offered steak and

1586
01:21:18,039 --> 01:21:20,508
eggs, and he refused it.

1587
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:21,676
Prison officials are now

1588
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:23,678
preparing to shave his head

1589
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:25,013
and prepare him for

1590
01:21:25,046 --> 01:21:27,048
execution at seven o'clock.

1591
01:21:28,016 --> 01:21:28,650
I would like to go right

1592
01:21:28,683 --> 01:21:32,354
in there and see him fry.

1593
01:21:32,387 --> 01:21:33,622
Burn

1594
01:21:33,655 --> 01:21:35,490
Ready for him to die.

1595
01:21:35,523 --> 01:21:36,258
Snap, crackle,

1596
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:39,561
pop, buddy.

1597
01:21:39,594 --> 01:21:40,629
Justice- justice is

1598
01:21:40,662 --> 01:21:41,496
gonna be served at seven

1599
01:21:41,529 --> 01:21:42,664
o'clock, bud.

1600
01:21:42,697 --> 01:21:46,635
(crowd noise)

1601
01:21:50,672 --> 01:21:51,306
I-I don't want to die.

1602
01:21:51,339 --> 01:21:53,675
I'm not going to lie to you.

1603
01:21:53,708 --> 01:21:56,278
I admit that.

1604
01:21:56,311 --> 01:21:57,112
And I'm not asking

1605
01:21:57,145 --> 01:21:58,580
for clemency.

1606
01:21:58,613 --> 01:21:59,247
I'm not asking

1607
01:21:59,281 --> 01:22:01,383
for forgiveness.

1608
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:04,452
I'm not asking for sympathy.

1609
01:22:04,486 --> 01:22:04,986
I know they're going to kill

1610
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:05,654
me sooner or later.

1611
01:22:05,687 --> 01:22:08,023
Uh, you don't need to worry

1612
01:22:08,056 --> 01:22:08,723
about that.

1613
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:11,226
But but there's a lot of

1614
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:13,762
crimes I could solve if the

1615
01:22:13,795 --> 01:22:14,696
state could just see fit to

1616
01:22:14,729 --> 01:22:16,765
let me live for two or three

1617
01:22:16,798 --> 01:22:17,766
years longer.

1618
01:22:17,799 --> 01:22:24,072
I-I mean look, I know I'm

1619
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:24,739
not like other people.

1620
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:29,110
I know I can't feel sympathy

1621
01:22:29,144 --> 01:22:34,015
for other people.

1622
01:22:34,049 --> 01:22:38,420
But I'm still human.

1623
01:22:41,056 --> 01:22:41,690
And then I cut her head

1624
01:22:41,723 --> 01:22:42,691
off with the hacksaw, and I

1625
01:22:42,724 --> 01:22:45,660
took it home with me.

1626
01:22:49,497 --> 01:22:50,031
I mean, there's so much

1627
01:22:50,065 --> 01:22:50,699
more to me than this guy

1628
01:22:50,732 --> 01:22:52,033
that goes around doing those

1629
01:22:52,067 --> 01:22:53,168
crazy things.

1630
01:22:53,201 --> 01:22:59,174
I, so much more.

1631
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:05,080
Yea, though I walk

1632
01:23:05,113 --> 01:23:06,314
through the valley of the

1633
01:23:06,348 --> 01:23:07,582
shadow of death, I will fear

1634
01:23:07,615 --> 01:23:08,783
no evil, for thou art

1635
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:10,385
with me.

1636
01:23:10,418 --> 01:23:11,686
Thy rod and thy staff, they

1637
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:13,455
comfort me.

1638
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:14,456
Thou preparest a table

1639
01:23:14,489 --> 01:23:15,357
before me in the presence of

1640
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:17,359
mine enemies.

1641
01:23:17,392 --> 01:23:19,160
Thou anointest my head

1642
01:23:19,194 --> 01:23:21,196
with oil.

1643
01:23:21,229 --> 01:23:23,365
My cup runneth over.

1644
01:23:23,398 --> 01:23:25,066
Surely, goodness and mercy

1645
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:26,267
will follow me all the days

1646
01:23:26,301 --> 01:23:28,737
of my life, and I will dwell

1647
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:30,472
in the house of the lord

1648
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:33,341
forever and ever.

1649
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:34,275
Amen, Ted.

1650
01:23:34,309 --> 01:23:37,245
Amen. Amen, Ted.

1651
01:23:37,278 --> 01:23:40,348
Hallelujah.

1652
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:47,489
Hello, Ted.

1653
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:48,790
Now you take it easy

1654
01:23:48,823 --> 01:23:50,725
now, Ted.

1655
01:23:50,759 --> 01:23:53,461
And just you just keep your

1656
01:23:53,495 --> 01:23:55,697
mind on Jesus.

1657
01:24:04,739 --> 01:24:07,108
It's time, Ted.

1658
01:24:07,142 --> 01:24:08,109
Come on out now.

1659
01:24:08,143 --> 01:24:08,643
Got a couple of things to

1660
01:24:08,676 --> 01:24:11,379
take care of.

1661
01:24:16,751 --> 01:24:19,687
Now, either you come out or

1662
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:21,122
we'll come in and getcha.

1663
01:24:21,156 --> 01:24:21,623
Don't make us come in

1664
01:24:21,656 --> 01:24:21,923
there, Ted.

1665
01:24:21,956 --> 01:24:25,727
Come on.

1666
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:31,499
Come on.

1667
01:24:31,533 --> 01:24:32,667
Take it easy.

1668
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:33,468
Take it easy now.

1669
01:24:33,501 --> 01:24:34,302
It's all right.

1670
01:24:34,335 --> 01:24:36,871
Take it easy now.

1671
01:24:36,905 --> 01:24:39,441
All right.

1672
01:25:06,234 --> 01:25:08,603
What's he doing?

1673
01:25:08,636 --> 01:25:11,306
Don't you worry about him.

1674
01:25:11,339 --> 01:25:11,773
Ted, listen to me,

1675
01:25:11,806 --> 01:25:13,908
okay? Listen.

1676
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:14,476
I want you to stay real

1677
01:25:14,509 --> 01:25:15,543
still for me, all right?

1678
01:25:15,577 --> 01:25:18,713
Can you do that?

1679
01:25:48,409 --> 01:25:49,511
This okay, Uncle Bob?

1680
01:25:49,544 --> 01:25:50,478
Goddamnit, how long you

1681
01:25:50,512 --> 01:25:53,748
been practicing that?

1682
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:04,859
All right.

1683
01:26:04,893 --> 01:26:07,762
You can go, Ted.

1684
01:26:07,795 --> 01:26:09,264
You're all done, okay?

1685
01:26:09,297 --> 01:26:12,534
You look beautiful.

1686
01:26:14,702 --> 01:26:17,238
What's that for?

1687
01:26:17,272 --> 01:26:19,541
That's to stuff your butt.

1688
01:26:19,574 --> 01:26:23,545
So you don't mess yourself.

1689
01:26:23,578 --> 01:26:24,245
What are you

1690
01:26:24,279 --> 01:26:25,013
talking about?

1691
01:26:25,046 --> 01:26:25,680
Ain't nothin' to be

1692
01:26:25,713 --> 01:26:27,282
ashamed of.

1693
01:26:27,315 --> 01:26:29,350
They all do it.

1694
01:26:29,384 --> 01:26:31,653
You will, too.

1695
01:26:31,686 --> 01:26:37,625
Now, drop them pants.

1696
01:26:37,659 --> 01:26:38,560
No.

1697
01:26:38,593 --> 01:26:39,127
Come on, Ted.

1698
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:39,761
Don't make it any harder

1699
01:26:39,794 --> 01:26:40,862
than it is.

1700
01:26:40,895 --> 01:26:42,830
Come on, Ted.

1701
01:26:42,864 --> 01:26:43,731
No!

1702
01:26:43,765 --> 01:26:46,267
No!

1703
01:26:46,301 --> 01:26:46,734
Come on.

1704
01:26:46,768 --> 01:26:51,439
No.

1705
01:26:51,472 --> 01:26:52,407
You relax now.

1706
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:52,907
If you relax, it'll be a lot

1707
01:26:52,941 --> 01:26:54,943
easier okay?

1708
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:58,680
Take it easy.

1709
01:26:58,713 --> 01:26:59,948
(yells)

1710
01:26:59,981 --> 01:27:00,715
Take it easy.

1711
01:27:00,748 --> 01:27:01,416
Try to breathe.

1712
01:27:01,449 --> 01:27:02,650
(yells)

1713
01:27:02,684 --> 01:27:06,454
Just try to breathe.

1714
01:27:06,487 --> 01:27:07,488
Is this okay Uncle Bob?

1715
01:27:07,522 --> 01:27:08,389
Yeah, that's good, Wesley.

1716
01:27:08,423 --> 01:27:10,725
Keep it comin'.

1717
01:27:10,758 --> 01:27:12,827
Aaw!

1718
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:15,663
Feels good, doesn't it?

1719
01:27:15,697 --> 01:27:16,531
Boy. Oh, got

1720
01:27:16,564 --> 01:27:18,600
cotton balls.

1721
01:27:18,633 --> 01:27:24,606
Oh, no!

1722
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:30,445
Just relax

1723
01:27:30,478 --> 01:27:31,713
More, Uncle Bob

1724
01:27:31,746 --> 01:27:32,981
Just like that, boy.

1725
01:27:33,014 --> 01:27:34,415
Stop!

1726
01:27:34,449 --> 01:27:36,951
Oh, God!

1727
01:27:36,985 --> 01:27:37,852
Come on now.

1728
01:27:37,885 --> 01:27:38,720
We're gonna stand up now.

1729
01:27:38,753 --> 01:27:40,588
Come on.

1730
01:27:40,622 --> 01:27:41,456
Come on.

1731
01:27:41,489 --> 01:27:41,990
You're all right.

1732
01:27:42,023 --> 01:27:42,790
Just breathe deep.

1733
01:27:42,824 --> 01:27:43,858
Breathe deep.

1734
01:27:43,891 --> 01:27:45,627
All right now, son.

1735
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:46,894
Come on now.

1736
01:27:46,928 --> 01:27:48,630
Stand up.

1737
01:27:48,663 --> 01:27:49,330
Hold on.

1738
01:27:49,364 --> 01:27:49,897
Hold on.

1739
01:27:49,931 --> 01:27:50,565
We got one more little

1740
01:27:50,598 --> 01:27:54,802
itty-bitty thing to do now.

1741
01:27:54,836 --> 01:27:55,470
It's for your own

1742
01:27:55,503 --> 01:28:00,742
good, Ted.

1743
01:28:00,775 --> 01:28:07,715
Good.

1744
01:28:12,053 --> 01:28:14,055
That's a good boy.

1745
01:28:14,088 --> 01:28:16,090
That's a good boy, huh?

1746
01:28:16,124 --> 01:28:19,360
Now, you ready?

1747
01:28:19,394 --> 01:28:19,894
We don't want to keep your

1748
01:28:19,927 --> 01:28:23,765
fans waitin', do we?

1749
01:28:23,798 --> 01:28:27,001
Come on.

1750
01:29:52,186 --> 01:29:54,689
Theodore Robert Bundy,

1751
01:29:54,722 --> 01:29:55,356
do you have a final

1752
01:29:55,389 --> 01:29:57,825
statement you'd like to make

1753
01:29:57,859 --> 01:29:58,626
before the sentence of the

1754
01:29:58,659 --> 01:30:03,598
court is carried out?

1755
01:30:03,631 --> 01:30:09,036
Yes.

1756
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:14,876
Tell my family I love them.

1757
01:30:14,909 --> 01:30:18,579
Tell them...

1758
01:32:58,039 --> 01:32:58,806
Authorities said that

1759
01:32:58,839 --> 01:32:59,407
Bundy spent the night

1760
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:00,741
weeping and praying.

1761
01:33:00,775 --> 01:33:01,909
Then, at seven A.M., he was

1762
01:33:01,943 --> 01:33:06,847
moved to the electric chair.

1763
01:33:07,381 --> 01:33:08,082
That's it.

1764
01:33:08,115 --> 01:33:09,050
That's it.

1765
01:33:09,083 --> 01:33:09,717
That's it.

1766
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:10,952
(cheers)

1767
01:33:10,985 --> 01:33:11,585
Theodore Bundy was

1768
01:33:11,619 --> 01:33:12,787
executed at seven-sixteen

1769
01:33:12,820 --> 01:33:14,956
this morning in the electric

1770
01:33:14,989 --> 01:33:15,923
chair at

1771
01:33:15,957 --> 01:33:16,824
Florida state prison.

1772
01:33:16,857 --> 01:33:18,326
He was executed for the

1773
01:33:18,359 --> 01:33:19,360
murder of twelve-year-old

1774
01:33:19,393 --> 01:33:20,795
Kimberly Leach of

1775
01:33:20,828 --> 01:33:22,196
Lake City, Florida.

1776
01:33:22,229 --> 01:33:23,297
You know he was also under

1777
01:33:23,331 --> 01:33:24,265
sentence of death for the

1778
01:33:24,298 --> 01:33:25,266
murder of two young women

1779
01:33:25,299 --> 01:33:27,101
in Tallahassee.

1780
01:33:27,134 --> 01:33:28,669
Everything was, uh, carried

1781
01:33:28,703 --> 01:33:29,937
out according to the book.

1782
01:33:29,971 --> 01:33:30,671
What will happen to

1783
01:33:30,705 --> 01:33:31,672
the body?

1784
01:33:31,706 --> 01:33:32,406
The body will be taken

1785
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:33,941
to a - a funeral home

1786
01:33:33,975 --> 01:33:37,078
in Gainesville.

1787
01:33:41,716 --> 01:33:43,351
Finally.

1788
01:33:43,384 --> 01:33:45,252
I can't believe it.

1789
01:33:45,286 --> 01:33:48,089
I was with him for years.

1790
01:33:48,122 --> 01:33:49,090
But I never knew him.

1791
01:33:49,123 --> 01:33:51,258
I never knew him at all.

1792
01:33:51,292 --> 01:33:55,229
Who was that guy?

1793
01:33:55,262 --> 01:33:59,000
Who was Ted Bundy?

1794
01:34:00,101 --> 01:34:02,436
I'm Ted Bundy.

1795
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:05,272
I'm Ted Bundy.

1796
01:34:05,306 --> 01:34:07,775
I'm Ted Bundy.

1797
01:34:07,808 --> 01:34:10,778
I'm Ted Bundy.
