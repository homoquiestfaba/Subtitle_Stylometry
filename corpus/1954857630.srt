1
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,530
Man:
Are you ( bleep ) kidding me?

2
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:47,347
Girl: Whoever named
this town "Downers Grove"

3
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,084
had a sick sense of humor.

4
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:56,900
The suburbs are the ghettos
of the meaningless...

5
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:06,409
...unless your town
has its very own curse,

6
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:09,741
where a senior dies each year
the week before graduation.

7
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:17,355
Now that suddenly gives
your town instant meaning.

8
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:44,041
( Radio static)

9
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,478
Announcer:
You asked for it and more!

10
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:46,982
Announcer #2:
102.3.

11
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,586
Man: A beautiful
sunny day here in Illinois,

12
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:52,121
a whopping 88 degrees.

13
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,122
Summer around the bend.

14
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,318
Got a big shout out
to all our seniors

15
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,156
at Downers Grove High School.

16
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:01,322
One week to graduation.
Make it count.

17
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:04,594
Don't get caught up in the curse.
Ha ha!

18
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:06,669
We're gonna keep playing
all the hits.

19
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:08,397
Announcer:
Your hit music channel.

20
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:10,166
Only the best music.

21
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:16,974
Hey.

22
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,782
What's he doing?

23
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:25,979
<i>Whoa!</i>

24
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,489
( cheering )

25
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,184
Danny, come on!

26
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,829
Yeah, yeah!

27
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:35,660
(cheering continues)

28
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,500
( screaming )

29
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:43,664
(thud)

30
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,342
Oh, shit.

31
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,347
It's the fucking curse.

32
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,277
( Minibike approaching )

33
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,785
Girl: It's only as few days
before graduation,

34
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:43,444
and the curse
hasn't happened yet.

35
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,723
Maybe it won't happen this year.

36
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:59,837
Maybe all the other accidents
are just a coincidence.

37
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:02,867
Hut!

38
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,175
( shouts )

39
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,736
Girl: At last year's sob fest,
the <i>class</i> president read a poem

40
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:38,604
that went something like,
"Don't try to understand everything

41
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,745
because some things
don't make sense."

42
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,074
( squawking )

43
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:50,014
But I can't help wondering
if the curse could be real.

44
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:11,767
The tall swarthy astronaut-type
is why mom dragged us here.

45
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,139
It's a bummer having a single
mother who's miserable.

46
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:17,805
So if astronaut-guy makes
her happy, astronaut-guy it is.

47
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,084
Man on radio: I mean,
come out of the suffering

48
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:29,818
and problems that you face in life

49
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:33,726
brought on because
of the choices that you make.

50
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:37,096
You simply reap what you sow.

51
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,895
Whoa!

52
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:41,733
No one said a word about Rich
the whole way over,

53
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:43,272
and I-- I would...

54
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,604
I would like your opinion.

55
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,110
Well, he isn't a meth addict.

56
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:50,805
Can I go now?

57
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,951
Sure.

58
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:56,947
Mom, I like him.

59
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,456
He seems nice, and I can tell
he really likes you.

60
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,630
I think he does. Thank you.

61
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,424
My angel.

62
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:10,625
I like him, too.

63
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:26,815
Boy: Who knows what Rich
has on his filthy,

64
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,213
repressed religious mind.

65
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,116
Cut him some slack.
He's taking her to Vegas.

66
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,277
Be happy or fake it.

67
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,014
I checked his Match.com profile.

68
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,955
- He enjoys frisky women.
- I don't wanna hear this.

69
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:39,154
And one day hopes to host
his own reality show.

70
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:40,889
Let's hope for the best.

71
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:43,466
Okay, so you've got all
the information. We're at the...

72
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:45,466
Both: Mandalay Bay
and you'll be back Friday.

73
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:46,899
Okay-

74
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,971
I never left you alone before,

75
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:52,702
so please, please,
please tell me not worry.

76
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:56,507
It is about that time the curse
of Downer's Grove rolls in.

77
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,172
Oh, my God.
I didn't even think of that.

78
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,979
Mom, the curse is complete B.S.
We'll be fine.

79
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:04,315
Go. Have a good time.

80
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,821
Okay. God, I love you guys.

81
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,721
Oh, my angels!

82
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:09,986
Come here.

83
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,152
No drumming after 7:00.

84
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,159
Wish me luck.
How do I look?

85
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,733
Is it okay?

86
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,371
Okay, Dave, you don't have
to hear this part.

87
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,029
I love you guys.

88
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:26,768
Okay?

89
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:39,050
Boy: Hey, Chrissie!

90
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:41,283
Dave:
There's your stalker boyfriend.

91
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:44,890
Chrissie: Stop it.

92
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:51,232
- He's harmless.
- He totally likes you.

93
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:02,735
For the zillionth time,

94
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:05,075
her room's all pink and lace
and shit. Not your type.

95
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:07,718
Do you really think
I'm interested in her room?

96
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:09,478
What am I,
an interior decorator?

97
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:12,486
You misread me completely
sometimes.

98
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:15,387
Did I just pass your morn
and her new dude?

99
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,585
- For an older guy, he's not bad.
- I totally agree.

100
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,990
Drop it. Diner?

101
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:24,834
And you're looking
exceptionally hot, Tracy.

102
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,801
And you're looking
exceptionally 15, Dave.

103
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:34,068
I think it's adorable
that you like me all the same.

104
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:40,145
Has she seen
our Facebook page yet?

105
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,446
Uh, I don't think so.

106
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,420
I would've heard, so, no.

107
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,286
Cool.

108
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:51,691
I'll be jamming here later,
if you wanna hang or whatever.

109
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:13,311
Why are we going this way?
Diner's in the other direction.

110
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:16,010
I thought you might want to see
if grease boy was still working.

111
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,712
His name's Bobby.

112
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,356
What? How do you know?

113
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,889
Because I asked him.

114
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,617
When?

115
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:25,058
First semester, when the brakes
on my <i>mom's</i> car went,

116
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:27,630
I was sitting in the shop
waiting, and we got to talking.

117
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,198
Why didn't you tell me?

118
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:35,672
Oh. Oh, I see.
You gave it up to him

119
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:38,741
in some hot steamy love pit
out back, didn't you?

120
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,741
You have to ask
why I didn't tell you?

121
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,641
You guys have been at it
like bunnies.

122
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,645
No. Nothing happened.
We're friends.

123
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,750
- With benefits?
- No.

124
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,647
Not even minimal benefits?

125
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:51,812
Not unless you count giving
my mom a discount a benefit.

126
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:53,389
(giggling )

127
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,322
So wait, hold on.
What's he like?

128
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,985
Actually, he defies the cliché
of townie mechanic.

129
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:01,393
He's smart, ambitious.

130
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,194
He can reassemble an engine
in a day.

131
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:06,894
Why would anyone
want to do that?

132
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:10,032
Just drive.

133
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,881
That's his car.

134
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:21,575
Dude, that's a lime green
fucking muscle car.

135
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,584
So? I like that about him.
It's unique.

136
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,223
So you already broke the ice
and then some?

137
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:28,086
Ruthless with holder!

138
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:31,695
What am I supposed to do with
this battery in my backseat?

139
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,228
You lost me.

140
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:35,593
I was supposed to take it
to the recycling center,

141
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,132
but then I selflessly thought,

142
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,963
"Hey, wouldn't this be
a nice opportunity

143
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,399
for Chrissie
to meet her crush?

144
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,439
Ask him to help
with the battery..."

145
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,542
Apparently I'm out of the loop.

146
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:48,374
( Tracy echoing )
You gave it up to him

147
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,538
in some hot steamy love pit
out back, didn't you?

148
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,775
He's totally your first, isn't he?

149
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:59,580
You raging 'ho.
Why the hell didn't you...

150
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:17,499
Tracy: I bet it's gonna be
Matt Goldberg or James Rocchi.

151
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:19,337
I have a weird feeling.

152
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,479
Plus they're super secret
Internet pervs

153
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,443
into underage shit
that'd make you puke.

154
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:26,812
Total sinners
and begging to be punished.

155
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:32,946
Girl:
I bet Lauren Solomon.

156
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,149
Bitch.

157
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,022
What are you doing?

158
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:40,164
Trying to work out who's next.

159
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,493
Chrissie: Did you ever think
maybe there'll be no next?

160
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,295
After so many in a row?
There's gotta be a next.

161
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,528
Says who?

162
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:48,104
Well, the curse.

163
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:49,672
Oh, so you spoke to the curse?

164
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,706
Chrissie, ever since '04,

165
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:54,344
a senior's died
right before graduation.

166
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,037
Girl: '05, Nina Golden
drowned in the quarry.

167
00:13:57,203 --> 00:14:00,309
Girl #2: '06, Scott Riley drove over
the embankment at Knoll's Hill.

168
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:02,146
Both of them were drunk,
by the way.

169
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:05,949
Girl: 2007, Jason Martin
shot in the liquor store.

170
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:09,616
2008, Myra Crawford, OD'd.

171
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,228
2009, '10, '11, '12.

172
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:15,195
Frank Esposito
ripped in half by the train.

173
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,494
Jennifer Licari, vanished.

174
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:19,659
Amy Mazur died in her sleep.

175
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:21,567
Keith Hardy, farming accident.

176
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:26,234
Last year, Michael Shaw,
water tower.

177
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,572
We were there, Chrissie.
We saw it.

178
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:32,205
I saw a meth head
choosing to climb a water tower,

179
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,646
not a curse.

180
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:35,410
I have to go.
I have a paper to finish.

181
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:38,215
You still have homework?
We're graduating on Saturday.

182
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,824
I'm late with my big report.
Mr. Keller gave me an extension.

183
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,017
I'm having a really hard time
concentrating.

184
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:44,559
Why? The curse?

185
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:48,255
Yeah. I mean,
someone we know is gonna die.

186
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:50,526
Look, we make choices.

187
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,762
Those choices produce results,
good or bad.

188
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:57,874
Climbing a water tower high?
Bad choice, bad result.

189
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,202
Going home to do your report

190
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:00,605
and forgetting all about
this curse so you can finish?

191
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:03,748
Good choice, good result.
See what I'm saying?

192
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,507
See you guys tomorrow.

193
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:06,706
Or maybe you won't.

194
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:08,546
Not funny, Chrissie.

195
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,245
She's right.
Don't joke about it.

196
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,721
Lighten up.

197
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,087
Tracy:
Way to clear a room.

198
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,786
Chrissie: Look, I want
to believe in a better place.

199
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,557
I remember all my
Sunday School stories.

200
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:24,031
Woman who turned into salt,
Noah's Ark,

201
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,534
the burning bush,
the star in the east.

202
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,228
I just hope they're all true

203
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:31,534
and not a bunch of made-up
stories thrown into a book.

204
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,370
I mean, if there's a God,

205
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,137
why would he make my dad
addicted to meth

206
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:38,077
so he could abandon
a wife and two kids?

207
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,114
And why would he give
my 12-year-old cousin

208
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,253
incurable bone cancer?

209
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:43,785
These are just personal gripes.

210
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,889
I'm not even gonna
to get into wars,

211
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,321
gas fucking ovens,
ethnic cleansing,

212
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:49,983
random, meaningless violence
and all that,

213
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:51,321
'cause we'd be here all night.

214
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,054
Wow.

215
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:56,063
That's hardcore deep shit, man.

216
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:58,498
I have a lot of stuff on my mind.

217
00:15:58,658 --> 00:15:59,898
Way too much stuff.

218
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,060
What the fuck?

219
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:04,731
Cut the shit! Jesus!

220
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,934
What's your problem, guy?

221
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,080
Are you psychic?
My name is Guy.

222
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:11,647
- No shit.
- Yeah, shit.

223
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,613
We were wondering if you girls
wanted to join us

224
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:15,480
on a little adventure.

225
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,781
Maybe next time when you don't
scare the shit out of us.

226
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,418
You don't know who he is,
do you?

227
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:24,084
Um, no.

228
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,196
Hi, pretty-

229
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:27,990
I'm Chuck.
What's your name?

230
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,634
I'm Brittany,
she's Courtney.

231
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,168
But we have to go.
Finals for college.

232
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:36,830
College? Really?

233
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,533
You guys look like maybe
you're still in high school.

234
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:41,645
And maybe you're worried
about the curse.

235
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:45,214
We survived the curse.
We're at Northwestern.

236
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:46,782
Where do you go?

237
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,384
Willow Creek.

238
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,545
Chuck is our star QB.
Do you guys not read the paper?

239
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,452
He was our backup
junior year--

240
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:56,219
Hey, Guy, shut the fuck up.

241
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,953
Why don't you guys
come to a party

242
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,155
over on our side of town?
It'll be fun.

243
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,833
No.

244
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:07,972
Hold, please, Chuck.

245
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:09,902
( Whispers )
Please don't make me beg.

246
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:11,735
Willow Creek's
in another county.

247
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:13,844
We'll do a drive-by.

248
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,675
If it's sketch,
we'll get out of there, okay?

249
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:19,544
Please.

250
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,343
- Chuck?
- Yeah.

251
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:25,148
It's a bad night.
Maybe some other time.

252
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,985
What if I promise
to have you home

253
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,423
before you turn
into a pumpkin?

254
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:33,359
Scout's honor.

255
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,578
( Music playing )

256
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:05,922
( glass shatters )

257
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,703
Let's not do
anything stupid, okay?

258
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:14,860
When have I ever?

259
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,904
- Really want me to answer that?
- Yes!

260
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:19,703
Actually, no.

261
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:29,409

You could totally
make out with him.

278
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:10,492
I wouldn't say anything.

279
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,527
It would just be
between you and me

280
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:14,255
and everyone else
who's watching.

281
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,763
( laughing )

282
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:18,197
One, two, three.

283
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:24,133
All right.
Let's go find those boys.

284
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:26,276
I'll be there in a sec.
You'll be okay, right?

285
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:29,311
I'll be fine. Very fine.

286
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,665
Hey.

287
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:50,630
Hey, you.

288
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,860
It's good to see you.

289
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,065
I didn't think
you were gonna come.

290
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:02,144
Yeah, me, too.
( laughs )

291
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,907
- You all right?
- Yeah, no, I'm fine. I'm fine.

292
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:08,012
Shh.

293
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,986
Whoa. Um...

294
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,528
I have to pee.

295
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:23,667
Sorry. I'm just gonna...
Just a sec.

296
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,673
(water running)

297
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:44,413
(turns faucet off)

298
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,090
( knocking )

299
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,454
Just a sec.

300
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,142
Hey.

301
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,211
What was that?

302
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:12,747
I had to go to the bathroom?

303
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,282
Relax, relax, relax.

304
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:24,485
Relax, relax, relax.
It's okay, it's okay.

305
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,823
- Um...
- It's okay. Shh...

306
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,127
Why are you freaking out?

307
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,633
- I'm not. I'm just--
- Shh...

308
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,609
- Um, Chuck, I feel like--
- It's okay. You feel like what?

309
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,677
I feel like I should probably
go find Tracy.

310
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:45,076
Make sure she's okay.

311
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:47,808
- She's fine.
- Chuck...

312
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,647
Hey. Whoa!
Slow down.

313
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,484
Hey! Whoa!
Chuck, come on, please?

314
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:57,189
Chuck, please?

315
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:58,487
- Please.
- Shh...

316
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,028
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

317
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:01,290
I'm just--

318
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:03,763
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

319
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:04,958
Please don't!

320
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:06,125
Stop it! Please!

321
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:08,033
Come on! Stop it!

322
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:10,800
- Wait till we finish.
- Get the fuck off me, Chuck.

323
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:12,806
This is it.

324
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:15,206
Hey!

325
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,973
Fuckin' finish it, bitch!

326
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:19,639
Fuck off me!
Get off of me!

327
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:21,478
- Get off!
- ( Chuck screams)

328
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,052
(screaming continues)

329
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:27,888
Where's Chuck?

330
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,995
(groaning )

331
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:40,637
Are you okay?

332
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:42,636
What the fuck
does it look like, you idiot?

333
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:44,172
( Groans )

334
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:48,404
Tracy? That guy Chuck
tried to fucking rape me.

335
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:51,810
Get out of there!
It's not fucking safe!

336
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:03,188
Hey!

337
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:08,025
( Barking )

338
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,377
- Are you okay?
- Get us out of here.

339
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:35,524
Okay, so definitely not
one of my best ideas.

340
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:41,357
Do you think the curse
may be on one of us?

341
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,124
No.

342
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:46,361
I mean, one of us would be dead,
right? If it was on one of us.

343
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:47,902
Maybe it just, like,
passed over us.

344
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,801
Shut the fuck up!

345
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:54,069
Okay. It's gonna be fine.

346
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:56,406
No, it's not gonna be
fucking fine!

347
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:57,603
Why not?

348
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,716
Because I think I just poked
some fucking guy's eye out,

349
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:02,478
so it's <i>so</i> far
from fucking fine!

350
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:07,088
We can never tell
anyone about this, okay?

351
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:08,281
Okay-

352
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,322
( horn honking )

353
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:18,126
We need a plan.

354
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,261
( Honki)

355
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:24,832
( honking )

356
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:28,805
( honki)

357
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,442
Shit.

358
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:47,658
(Chrissie, thinking )
God, if you do exist and can hear me,

359
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,460
please let this all be a bad dream.

360
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,440
Man on TV: Our friend
seems to be awakening.

361
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:05,139
Man #2: I-- where--
where is this? Where am I?

362
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:07,341
Man #1:
Do not be alarmed, my friend.

363
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,884
My man Ivan found
you in the crypt.

364
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:12,283
( Water spraying )

365
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:19,318
Shit.

366
00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:21,692
Oh, God!

367
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,356
(grunts)

368
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,460
Fu...

369
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:27,801
( groans )

370
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,837
Oh, shit.

371
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:31,474
Oh, God!

372
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:35,305
( Panting )

373
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:36,468
( groans )

374
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:38,637
( panting )

375
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:47,724
What are you doing?
Let me see your eye.

376
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,359
Oh, my God!
What happened to you?

377
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:51,017
- Can you see?
- No.

378
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:53,220
- What?
- No, I can't see!

379
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,728
You know what that does to
your fucking football career?

380
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:56,389
No, I don't know!

381
00:25:56,555 --> 00:26:00,367
They won't even hire
a fucking one-eyed mascot!

382
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:04,064
I busted my ass for years to get
you out of this fucked-up town!

383
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,266
And now...

384
00:26:06,432 --> 00:26:08,434
Damn it!

385
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,911
( Whimpers )

386
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,365
(voices whispering )

387
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:41,635
( chanting )

388
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:47,943
( girl screams )

389
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,815
( min grunts)

390
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:51,977
(chanting continues)

391
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:53,589
(Girl, echoing)
Someone we know is gonna die.

392
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,588
( Gasps )

393
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,393
Chrissie:
I've been dreaming about Indians

394
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,631
since I was a little girl.

395
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:13,072
Maybe it's because
our town was built

396
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:16,941
on land that was stolen
from the Indians in 1832.

397
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:21,451
I can't help but wonder

398
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:23,587
if this has something to do
with the curse.

399
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,244
But if that were the case,

400
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,913
then all of America
would be cursed.

401
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,253
Maybe we all are.

402
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:36,356
Stop it.

403
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:38,798
You're making connections
that aren't there.

404
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:40,493
There is no fucking curse,

405
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,434
God is elusive if he exists,

406
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:44,665
and you poked out
some goon's eye at a party

407
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,208
after he tried to rape you.

408
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:50,279
That's reality.
Get out of your head and deal.

409
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:57,211
What are you doing?

410
00:27:57,376 --> 00:27:59,947
The acoustics in the basement
started to sound funk-defied.

411
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:03,355
It's five in the morning.
Everything sounds...

412
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,290
whatever it is you just said.

413
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,452
You came in last night like
you were in a wrestling match

414
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:09,121
with an engine.

415
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:12,292
You finally get into it
with that mechanic?

416
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:15,370
Hey, what is going on with you?

417
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,375
What happened last night?

418
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,636
Nothing.

419
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,178
Hey, hey-

420
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:26,043
When Dad was around
and had his fits,

421
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,878
you always
protected me and mom.

422
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:33,251
The least I can do is step up
and help when you need it.

423
00:28:33,412 --> 00:28:34,914
Okay-

424
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:39,660
I don't even know
where to start.

425
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:42,424
Ask me about last night.
Whatever you want.

426
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:45,999
Did Tracy say anything
about me?

427
00:28:46,158 --> 00:28:47,535
Dweeb.

428
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:50,503
I have other follow-u ps.
That was just my lead-in.

429
00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:13,559
(line ringing)

430
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:16,859
( ringtone playing )

431
00:29:23,362 --> 00:29:25,137
What?

432
00:29:26,565 --> 00:29:28,476
Did you give any of them
your real name?

433
00:29:28,634 --> 00:29:30,113
Hell, no.

434
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:31,612
What about your purse
with your lD's?

435
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,215
Do you still have it?

436
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:36,148
Hell, yes. Good night.

437
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:38,788
It's already morning.

438
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:55,936
(bell ringing)

439
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:02,443
Sorry.

440
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:04,979
It's okay. I'm just jumpy.

441
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:07,913
You know, we've been friends
since we were in kindergarten,

442
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:11,179
and there's something weird
happening between us.

443
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:12,686
I can't take it anymore.

444
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:14,482
What do you mean?

445
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,956
You haven't answered my texts
in weeks. What did I do?

446
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:19,527
Nothing.
I'vejust been really busy.

447
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,162
Is it the mechanic?

448
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:24,323
Are you keeping tabs on me?

449
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:28,869
Your brother is a font
of useful info, and...

450
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:31,507
- I happen to care a little bit.
- ( bell ringing)

451
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,644
- Come on. I'm parked near you.
- All right.

452
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:40,176
I guess I have been
avoiding you.

453
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:41,647
Why?

454
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:43,616
I don't wanna hurt you.

455
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:45,118
Hurt me from what?

456
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:48,349
You know, we went to prom,
and that happened.

457
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:49,617
It's just weird.

458
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:51,818
Because you laid
a sloppy kiss on me?

459
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:55,294
We were drunk, and we kissed.
So what?

460
00:30:55,454 --> 00:30:57,400
I don't want to lead you on.

461
00:30:57,556 --> 00:31:00,469
Whoa. You thought
I spun a drunken kiss

462
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:03,538
into some kind of
potential relationship?

463
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,572
Really?

464
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:09,207
I'm such an idiot.

465
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:13,009
( laughing )

466
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:16,709
I can just erase it
from my mind, if you so wish.

467
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,482
Want me to-- Okay.

468
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:24,992
There you go. It's gone.

469
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:28,024
Come on.

470
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:29,563
Where are we going?

471
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,564
I don't remember
what I was doing.

472
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,863
You and Monica Chase?
When did that happen?

473
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:38,030
Uh, recent, recent.
Very recent.

474
00:31:39,498 --> 00:31:42,570
Sorry. You should wait here
for a second.

475
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,614
What are you doing here?

476
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:53,382
You're not a very nice girl.

477
00:31:55,614 --> 00:31:57,525
I mean, why the fuck would you
do something like this

478
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:59,855
to somebody who has
an earnest interest in you?

479
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:02,362
An earnest interest
in raping me.

480
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:05,229
Is that how you remember it?

481
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,893
I seem to recall it differently.

482
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:10,934
No?

483
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:12,700
What do you want, Chuck?

484
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,302
What do I want?

485
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,311
What do I want?

486
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,888
- Can I get a ride?
- No.

487
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:31,584
Dave, right?

488
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,491
How do you know his name?

489
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:34,892
I'm Chuck.

490
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:37,465
Pleasure.

491
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,795
By the way, I'm really sorry
to hear about your dad.

492
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:43,064
It's... terrible.

493
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:46,300
No kid should have
to go through that.

494
00:32:48,934 --> 00:32:51,505
- Hi, pal.
- Hi.

495
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:54,514
Who the hell was that?
And how does he know about Dad?

496
00:32:54,673 --> 00:32:56,846
Chuck Whitmore,
starting QB for Willow

497
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:58,954
with a really fucked-up eye.

498
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,589
If either of you
ever see him again,

499
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:02,122
just stay away from him.

500
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,830
Why are you here
on your day off?

501
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,997
The sooner I get the cars
into racing shape,

502
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:21,201
the sooner I can sell them.

503
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:29,615
What's wrong?

504
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:32,550
Are you mothering
your mom again?

505
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:34,782
No. She's away.

506
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,392
I just did something
really stupid.

507
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,120
Like what?

508
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:45,794
You know that group of
Willow Creek football players?

509
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:49,302
Yeah. They drive by
wasted all the time.

510
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:52,465
Yeah, well, Tracy and I went
to one of their parties,

511
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:57,205
and that guy Chuck
tried to attack me.

512
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,381
Are you okay?

513
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,214
Yeah.

514
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:07,687
Look, if he ever
comes near you again,

515
00:34:07,846 --> 00:34:11,020
just promise me
you'll come to me for help.

516
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:19,164
( Heavy breathing )

517
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:21,201
You're pretty cute
when you're worried.

518
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:27,199
Nice. That's nice.

519
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:29,504
How about when
I'm not worried?

520
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:31,705
Un-cute?

521
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,747
No, no, no, no.

522
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:37,011
You're beautiful.

523
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:40,122
But, um, you worry a lot.

524
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:42,280
- So...
- I 9i99le5)

525
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:43,892
Nice save, Bobby.

526
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:46,290
- I should go.
- Uh...

527
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:48,897
No, well, look, don't--
You don't have to leave.

528
00:34:49,054 --> 00:34:50,863
I'm gonna be working
on this car for a while,

529
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:55,630
so you're more than welcome to
stay if... you still want to.

530
00:34:55,794 --> 00:34:59,401
Bobby, mind if I make a complete
and utter ass of myself?

531
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:01,441
The floor's yours.

532
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,580
I've been coming by for months.

533
00:35:03,735 --> 00:35:05,737
We share all these
intimate secrets, and...

534
00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:08,077
why haven't you
asked me out?

535
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,047
L-- I don't know.

536
00:35:16,715 --> 00:35:18,456
Okay, uh...

537
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:21,757
Sorry for putting you
on the spot.

538
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,593
Bye.

539
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:34,841
(grunting )

540
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,302
What did the doctor say?

541
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:02,495
( Panting )

542
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,441
You can play, right?

543
00:36:06,598 --> 00:36:08,942
Spot me. Spot me.

544
00:36:11,036 --> 00:36:13,038
All right. One more.

545
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:15,309
(grunts)

546
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:19,816
- What did the doctor say?
- Shut up!

547
00:36:19,978 --> 00:36:22,356
Would you just
shut the fuck up?

548
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:24,790
What'd the doctor say?
He said I'm fucking blind.

549
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:26,792
That if I'm lucky,
I'll be seeing in my right eye

550
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:29,397
in about 35 fucking years.
That's what the doctor said.

551
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:31,556
That someday maybe
I'll end up being

552
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:34,795
some fucking townie piece
of shit loser like you, Guy.

553
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:38,634
Maybe someday
if I'm fucking lucky!

554
00:36:38,797 --> 00:36:39,798
Fuck!

555
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:43,336
( Door opens, closes )

556
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:47,844
Chrissie.

557
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:52,387
Ian, what's wrong?
What happened?

558
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:54,421
I was jumped.

559
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:57,219
- Did you see him?
- Who?

560
00:36:57,382 --> 00:37:01,330
- Whoever did this.
- It happened too fast.

561
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,424
Does this have to do with you?

562
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:08,662
It's better if you just
keep away from me.

563
00:37:08,827 --> 00:37:10,738
But...

564
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,053
- So you hold it like that.
- Yeah?

565
00:37:24,209 --> 00:37:27,247
- Make sure you press here.
- But what's that going to do?

566
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:29,255
Just ignore that.
That's just decoration.

567
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:30,415
- Decoration?
- Yeah.

568
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:31,925
- You drew that?
- Yeah.

569
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,619
- That's pretty cool.
- Yeah?

570
00:37:33,785 --> 00:37:35,355
( laughing )

571
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,590
- Okay, show me.
-( door opens)

572
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,132
Show me.

573
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:42,402
- ( Door closes)
- Ugh!

574
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,972
God, this is not happening.

575
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:47,132
- Seriously?
- Wait! Hey!

576
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:50,074
Dave said the freak show
showed up at school today.

577
00:37:50,235 --> 00:37:51,578
( Whispers )
Shit, man.

578
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,615
Yeah, he came by school,
knew exactly who I was,

579
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:01,280
who my brother was,
mentioned Dad.

580
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:03,323
Yeah? Hmm?

581
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:04,824
What are you doing?

582
00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:06,758
You know,
I think the freak show

583
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:09,091
was probably just
trying to scare you.

584
00:38:09,254 --> 00:38:10,460
What?

585
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,295
(distant drumming)

586
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,994
What are you not telling me?

587
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:19,336
I'm sorry.

588
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:21,443
In advance.

589
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,442
(drumming continues)

590
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:26,582
You agreed to what?
A fucking party here?

591
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:29,150
- Are you out of your mind?
- It was her idea.

592
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,981
- We came up with it together.
- It's all over Facebook.

593
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,646
Yeah, if you checked your page,
Tracy's page, or my page,

594
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:35,814
you would've known last week.

595
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,186
What's that supposed to mean?

596
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:40,420
- Tell her, Tracy.
- Yeah, tell me, Tracy.

597
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:42,690
We werejust thinking you could
use a little social jolt

598
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:44,265
heading into summer.

599
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:47,028
How selfless of you both,
but no fucking way.

600
00:38:47,192 --> 00:38:49,365
Tracy, you may like
hooking up with random dudes,

601
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:50,835
doing whatever drug they put
in front of your face,

602
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,201
but that's not me.

603
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:54,001
I have a dad
who's an addict, okay?

604
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,145
Could even be dead by now,
for all I know.

605
00:38:56,301 --> 00:38:58,872
I don't want people doing weird
shit in this fucking house!

606
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:01,677
Cancel it.

607
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,650
What? Post it on Facebook.
Canceled.

608
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:06,447
It's not that easy.

609
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:09,490
It's been on our Twitter feeds.
We sent out a mass email.

610
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:11,786
If you paid more attention
to social media

611
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:14,362
instead of lurking around a gas
station between honors classes,

612
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:17,159
- you'd know.
- Shut up! Shut up!

613
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:19,962
Find a way to cancel that party.

614
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:23,298
And stop smoking that shit
in the house!

615
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:32,542
Hey, Bobby. What's up?

616
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:37,016
Um... uh...

617
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:39,553
Chrissie's best-kept secret
here in the flesh.

618
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:42,521
Bobby, is it? I have heard
so many rad stories about you.

619
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,353
Weren't you in the middle of
something really important?

620
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:46,688
Oh, yeah, right, the party.
Tuesday night.

621
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:48,888
I hope you can make it, Bobby.

622
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:55,334
Urn, so...

623
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:57,370
Y-Yeah...

624
00:39:57,528 --> 00:40:00,941
I came over here to, uh...

625
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:04,342
just to ask you if you would
like to go on a date with me.

626
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:06,345
Now?

627
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:10,042
No, not-- not now.
We don't have to go now.

628
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:12,449
If you don't, if you can't--
I can come hack.

629
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,385
Now's perfect. Uh...

630
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:16,456
I'm just gonna go change
real quick.

631
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:17,718
Okay-

632
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:22,562
Ohh...

633
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:41,951
(engine starts)

634
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,724
Chrissie:
It's beautiful.

635
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:53,452
Bobby: Question--
what where you thinking,

636
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,461
going to that party
in the first place?

637
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,896
Why? Do I sense
a little jealousy?

638
00:40:58,056 --> 00:41:01,435
Let's... call it concern.

639
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:06,764
Next question.

640
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:10,105
What does a girl like you want
with a grease monkey like me?

641
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,305
God. I don't know.

642
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,747
You're, uh...

643
00:41:15,907 --> 00:41:18,080
You're different.

644
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:24,787
So what do you think
about this curse

645
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:26,758
everyone keeps talking about?

646
00:41:26,918 --> 00:41:28,454
( Heavy breathing )

647
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:30,826
That's like asking
if you believe in God,

648
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:33,697
the afterlife,
the supernatural.

649
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:35,860
Do you?

650
00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:37,370
( Chuckles )

651
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:39,667
No. The curse?
Absolutely not.

652
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,811
What about God?

653
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:44,537
I mean, I'm not really
a religious guy or anything,

654
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:46,978
but just look at that sky.

655
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:50,176
Impossible that was man-made.

656
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,945
It's made up of molecules.

657
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:55,887
The clouds are made up
of tiny droplets of water

658
00:41:56,047 --> 00:41:59,824
and ice crystals so light
they hang in the sky.

659
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:03,557
I flunked in whatever class
you learned that in, but...

660
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:06,327
let's agree it's not man-made.

661
00:42:06,491 --> 00:42:07,799
Okay-

662
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:13,502
( heavy breathing )

663
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:15,970
Um...

664
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:20,042
What about
physical attraction?

665
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:24,346
Is that made up
of molecules, too?

666
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:34,525
Sorry.

667
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:51,703
( Knocking )

668
00:42:55,006 --> 00:42:56,542
You're fucking...

669
00:42:56,707 --> 00:42:58,948
You're fucking
out of your mind, dude.

670
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,851
What the fuck
are you doing here?

671
00:43:01,012 --> 00:43:02,787
I need to talk to her.
It's really important.

672
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:04,858
No, it's not!
Get the fuck out!

673
00:43:05,016 --> 00:43:09,123
Bobby, it's fine, okay?
I'll be back in one second.

674
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:10,630
Hey, it's gonna be fine.

675
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:12,392
This is something
that I have to do.

676
00:43:12,557 --> 00:43:15,231
Roll your window up.
He's high <i>as</i> hell.

677
00:43:15,393 --> 00:43:17,373
He tried to fucking rape you.

678
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:20,737
Bobby, I can handle this.

679
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:32,720
What? Are you stalking me?

680
00:43:32,877 --> 00:43:34,584
Did you attack my friend Ian?

681
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:35,746
No.

682
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:37,153
( Car door opens )

683
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:44,459
I, uh... Can I just--
I need to talk to you.

684
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,431
About what?

685
00:43:46,591 --> 00:43:49,595
I've been thinking about
that thing you said.

686
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,433
The question you asked.

687
00:43:51,596 --> 00:43:52,768
What question?

688
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:55,934
About what I want.

689
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,808
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

690
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:03,513
Um... I had a dream.

691
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:06,314
And it was fucking vivid.

692
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,821
And then all of sudden, it just...

693
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,426
All this stuff made sense.

694
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:14,085
What? What made sense?

695
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:17,361
This.

696
00:44:17,522 --> 00:44:19,695
What are you talking about?

697
00:44:21,259 --> 00:44:23,933
See, I know that you...

698
00:44:24,095 --> 00:44:26,507
You're feeling the same thing
I'm feeling.

699
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,337
Chuck...

700
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,206
I don't.

701
00:44:30,368 --> 00:44:33,508
Yeah, you do.
Yeah, you do.

702
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,878
You have to.

703
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,145
- No. You're crazy.
- Right?

704
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:39,481
No, Chuck.

705
00:44:39,644 --> 00:44:42,386
Yeah. And...

706
00:44:42,547 --> 00:44:44,527
And that's why
this all makes sense.

707
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,355
You know,
that's why I forgive you.

708
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,861
Forgive me?
Are you kidding?

709
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,398
That's why this is
gonna work for us.

710
00:44:51,556 --> 00:44:54,799
Chuck, there is no "we."

711
00:44:54,959 --> 00:44:57,462
There is no fucking "us."

712
00:44:57,628 --> 00:44:59,471
Whatever you think
you know about me,

713
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:02,736
it's all fucking made up
in your head.

714
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,141
All this shit you're doing,
following me,

715
00:45:05,303 --> 00:45:06,873
you need to stop it,

716
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:09,678
and you just need to keep
the fuck away from me, Chuck.

717
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,753
Stay the fuck away from me.

718
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,390
( Car doors close )

719
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:22,019
(engine starts)

720
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:24,723
(car pulls away)

721
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:28,427
( police radio chatter)

722
00:45:28,593 --> 00:45:30,766
He followed us to the bluff.

723
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:32,669
Man:
What did he say exactly?

724
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:35,504
He thinks we're in
some kind of relationship.

725
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:38,374
Unfortunately there's not much
we can do with that.

726
00:45:38,536 --> 00:45:40,015
Chrissie:
This guy's serious.

727
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:41,775
He tried to rape me.

728
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:43,509
- Any witnesses?
- No.

729
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:45,745
He cornered me in a bathroom.

730
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:48,390
Hey, look,
I mean, she's here now.

731
00:45:48,546 --> 00:45:50,617
Do you guys really want to be
the ones who were warned

732
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:52,283
and then dropped the ball
after the fact?

733
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:54,521
Can't just arrest him.
I can pay him a visit,

734
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:56,062
let him know
we've been made aware.

735
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,222
Usually that's enough.
What's his name?

736
00:45:58,389 --> 00:46:01,734
- Chuck Whitmore.
- Chuck Whitmore.

737
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:03,963
The WC football player.

738
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:05,766
Chuck Whitmore.

739
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:08,604
Yeah, Charlie Whitmore's son.
Charlie's one of us.

740
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,473
So what, that makes him
untouchable?

741
00:46:10,635 --> 00:46:13,309
I think it's best if we
show it to Charlie first.

742
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:15,041
That's enough for now.

743
00:46:15,206 --> 00:46:17,447
When we know more,
you'll know more.

744
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,315
- So that's it?
- Yeah.

745
00:46:19,477 --> 00:46:21,889
That's it.

746
00:46:29,587 --> 00:46:31,396
His dad's an ex-cop?

747
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:35,401
Right, yeah.
Which is not a good thing.

748
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:37,061
Didn't make me feel any better.

749
00:46:37,228 --> 00:46:39,469
As soon as I mentioned his name,
they completely changed.

750
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,234
I'm definitely staying over.

751
00:46:41,399 --> 00:46:42,400
Awesome.

752
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:43,840
On <i>the couch.</i>

753
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:45,480
That's cool.

754
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,343
Jake pissed on it a bunch.
It's been cleaned.

755
00:46:47,505 --> 00:46:49,007
I don't know if it ever
really, truly comes out,

756
00:46:49,173 --> 00:46:50,447
but if you want to...

757
00:46:50,608 --> 00:46:53,646
Chrissie:
Stop. Please?

758
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:59,784
Well, hey, I don't want to
invite myself over--

759
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:02,624
Yes. Stay.

760
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:06,157
That'd be good.

761
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:10,495
Okay, cool. Well, um...

762
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:13,107
I guess I just need to let my boss
know I'll be in and out.

763
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:16,603
Are you sure you don't mind
sticking around?

764
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:18,610
No, of course not.

765
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:20,942
Does that thing work?

766
00:47:21,105 --> 00:47:22,982
Okay, well, use it.

767
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:35,019
( Beeping )

768
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:05,924

769
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:08,324
(dog barking )

770
00:48:27,772 --> 00:48:28,876
- ( girl screams)
- What are you doing?

771
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:30,040
Jesus!

772
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,050
( laughs )
I'm sorry.

773
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:34,246
I took a mean spill.

774
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:36,722
Your brother has
some serious weed.

775
00:48:36,881 --> 00:48:38,224
( laughs )

776
00:48:39,784 --> 00:48:42,424
-( knocking )
- Hey, it's Bobby.

777
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:58,436
I don't have a condom,

778
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:01,139
and even if you do in your
wallet, I'm still a virgin,

779
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:04,582
and I'd like for it
to stay that way, temporarily.

780
00:49:07,745 --> 00:49:10,089
You know, it hadn't even
crossed my mind.

781
00:49:11,382 --> 00:49:12,452
I was kidding.

782
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:15,620
It did, but I got rid of
the idea quick.

783
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,663
Okay, um...

784
00:49:17,822 --> 00:49:20,894
I should probably go to sleep
'cause I have school tomorrow.

785
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:26,907
Will you be here
when I get back?

786
00:49:28,766 --> 00:49:31,838
Yeah, of course,
if it makes you feel safe.

(school bell ringing )

796
00:51:01,191 --> 00:51:02,329
Chrissie:
Maybe there is a curse,

797
00:51:02,493 --> 00:51:03,597
and this year it's on me.

798
00:51:03,761 --> 00:51:05,763
It's the curse.

799
00:51:13,871 --> 00:51:15,612
(Chrissie, thinking)
Maybe I'm the curse.

800
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:24,458
Is that the mechanic's car?

801
00:51:24,615 --> 00:51:26,060
It's nothing.
Thanks for the ride.

802
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:27,524
It's not nothing.
It belongs to that guy.

803
00:51:27,685 --> 00:51:29,687
So Why'd you have
to fucking ask, Ian?

804
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:30,854
( Chuckles )

805
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:33,194
- Sorry.
- It's fine.

806
00:51:33,357 --> 00:51:35,234
You barely said a word
the whole ride home.

807
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:37,065
You got a stranger's car
in your driveway

808
00:51:37,227 --> 00:51:40,367
and this look on your face like
someone is trying to kill you.

809
00:51:40,531 --> 00:51:42,738
Oh, and your locker blew up.

810
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,642
You can't pretend like
it's just another day.

811
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:49,975
Hey, look, I've known you
since kindergarten.

812
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:52,484
You can tell me anything.

813
00:51:52,643 --> 00:51:54,418
If you're worried
about the curse,

814
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:57,286
there's only three days left
to graduation, and if there's--

815
00:51:57,448 --> 00:52:02,830
Bobby, whose car it is,
we started dating and...

816
00:52:02,987 --> 00:52:05,160
and the rest is PMS.

817
00:52:16,934 --> 00:52:19,608
(gunfire on TV)

818
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:23,308
Guys, get out of your PJs
and cancel that fucking party.

819
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:26,353
We tried. We posted
Facebook messages and...

820
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:28,456
We did our best,
but it's in the ether,

821
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:31,616
and we can't stop people
from showing up.

822
00:52:31,782 --> 00:52:33,819
What's wrong?
Something happen?

823
00:52:42,126 --> 00:52:43,662
Are you sure it was him?

824
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:46,330
The fucking car battery
was in my locker, Tracy.

825
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:50,634
Where are you going?

826
00:52:50,801 --> 00:52:52,144
It's probably better
if we don't talk about it.

827
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:54,543
- You can't.
- The hell I can.

828
00:52:54,705 --> 00:52:56,378
If I don't do something about it,
it's just gonna get worse.

829
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:57,712
Bobby...

830
00:52:57,875 --> 00:52:58,876
Come on.

831
00:52:59,043 --> 00:53:01,023
Hey, listen to me.

832
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,350
Bobby?

833
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:04,686
Bobby, I'm serious.
Come on.

834
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:07,829
Look, you don't know me
that well. I can take him.

835
00:53:07,985 --> 00:53:09,623
You're right.
I don't know you.

836
00:53:09,787 --> 00:53:12,131
But I know that
if you do something stupid,

837
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:15,862
you could wind up in jail
or worse.

838
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:18,973
And I'm not up for that.

839
00:53:26,837 --> 00:53:28,248
Okay-

840
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:32,187
We'll do it your way.

841
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:33,753
- What is your way?
- I don't have a way.

842
00:53:33,911 --> 00:53:35,584
I can't think.

843
00:53:35,746 --> 00:53:39,888
You know, it might not be
such a bad idea to have the party.

844
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:43,691
Just hear me out.
If this guy's stupid enough

845
00:53:43,854 --> 00:53:46,334
to show up at your door
uninvited with a bone to pick,

846
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:48,197
we'll have plenty of witnesses.

847
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:50,235
And as long as I can
make sure you're safe,

848
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:54,774
then the cops or his dad
won't be able to save him.

849
00:53:54,932 --> 00:53:57,606
It's just nights like tonight
that I get so concerned about,

850
00:53:57,768 --> 00:53:59,213
the nights where
I won't be here.

851
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:01,440
I don't get off till 3 a.m.

852
00:54:01,605 --> 00:54:03,448
I'll be here when you get back.

853
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:05,348
I promise.

854
00:54:05,509 --> 00:54:07,182
You better be.

855
00:54:16,854 --> 00:54:17,924
( Door closes )

856
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:24,403
Your new boyfriend is rad.

857
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:25,938
And your girlfriend is a slut.

858
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,576
You're not gonna hear
any complaints from me.

859
00:54:28,732 --> 00:54:31,872
She feels bad enough.
So do I.

860
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:36,447
You remember how Dad
taught us how to shoot?

861
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:39,281
Yeah. I have
permanent ear damage.

862
00:54:39,443 --> 00:54:41,923
Well, I guess he was too scared
to use his shotgun on himself

863
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:44,821
before he left
and forgot it when he split.

864
00:54:44,982 --> 00:54:48,589
It's in my room under my bed.

865
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:50,595
Good to know.

866
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,099

00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:32,230
Sounds like
it's coming from outside.

883
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:33,732
( Coughs )

884
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:37,703
-( barking continues)
- ( tires screeching )

885
00:56:53,677 --> 00:56:56,556
Hey, Jake, what is it?

886
00:56:59,016 --> 00:57:00,962
Call the cops.

887
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:34,285
Bobby!

888
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:37,455
If you keep this up,
it's only gonna get uglier.

889
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:39,726
Keep what up?

890
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:43,269
You made your point, all right?
Just let it go.

891
00:57:43,427 --> 00:57:45,771
( laughs )
No, man.

892
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:48,239
I haven't even come close
to making my point.

893
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:50,309
(Sighs)

894
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,775
( scoffs )

895
00:57:51,935 --> 00:57:53,471
So tell me, Bobby,

896
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:56,777
what the fuck are you
gonna do about it?

897
00:57:58,642 --> 00:58:00,781
Whatever I have to.

898
00:58:02,612 --> 00:58:04,455
Let's take a walk.

899
00:58:12,022 --> 00:58:14,628
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Back up, back up, back up!

900
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:17,135
Back up, back up.

901
00:58:18,762 --> 00:58:20,935
Put that down.

902
00:58:21,098 --> 00:58:23,100
Let's do this like men.
Put it down.

903
00:58:28,138 --> 00:58:30,015
I love that you think this is
gonna make a difference.

904
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:32,312
When I'm done with her,
you're going to be tasting me

905
00:58:32,476 --> 00:58:34,956
for the rest of your life.

906
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:05,011
Ooh!

907
00:59:08,178 --> 00:59:09,657
There you go.

908
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:15,056
Good stuff.

909
00:59:25,028 --> 00:59:27,008
I learned a lot about
conflict resolution

910
00:59:27,164 --> 00:59:29,440
in my advanced psych classes.

911
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:31,545
- Oh, did you?
- Mm-hmm.

912
00:59:31,701 --> 00:59:35,080
The last resort
is physical violence.

913
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:37,411
I would've had him
had he not cheap-shotted me.

914
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:38,575
( Heavy breathing )

915
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:41,848
Look, you know about my dad
and meth, right?

916
00:59:42,012 --> 00:59:43,855
What I never told you
was that because of that

917
00:59:44,014 --> 00:59:47,291
he owed some money
to some bad people.

918
00:59:47,451 --> 00:59:49,294
I spent too many nights
either fighting him off

919
00:59:49,453 --> 00:59:51,865
or mending him.

920
00:59:52,022 --> 00:59:55,902
So, please, do not
go after Chuck again.

921
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:58,539
Hey, look at me.

922
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:05,739
Look at me.

923
01:00:05,902 --> 01:00:07,404
Say it.

924
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:10,484
Say it.

925
01:00:16,313 --> 01:00:18,816
I won't go after him again.

926
01:00:18,982 --> 01:00:20,154
Good.

927
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:37,808
Boy:
We gotta figure out what to do.

928
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:39,276
We can't just fucking
sit around here and just--

929
01:00:39,436 --> 01:00:40,437
Boy #2: We're gonna fucking
do something.

930
01:00:40,604 --> 01:00:41,776
As soon as Chuck
figures what we're doing,

931
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:42,939
we're gonna go fucking do it.

932
01:00:43,106 --> 01:00:45,416
Whatever he says,
that's what we're gonna do.

933
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:48,852
What the fuck are we gonna do
about these two?

934
01:00:50,747 --> 01:00:52,158
These chicks, man.

935
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:54,352
They think that they can get--

936
01:00:54,518 --> 01:00:55,997
- Son of a bitch.
- I'm gonna fuck her friend.

937
01:00:56,153 --> 01:00:58,360
- Her little faggot brother, too.
- I'm gonna fuck--

938
01:00:58,522 --> 01:00:59,626
- So what are we gonna do?
- We're gonna do something.

939
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:00,790
We're going to fucking
do something.

940
01:01:00,957 --> 01:01:03,597
As soon as Chuck says what we're
gonna do, we're gonna do.

941
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,297
What about her faggot-ass
little brother?

942
01:01:06,463 --> 01:01:08,841
- ( Snorting )
- What about her brother?

943
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:10,103
You know what I think?

944
01:01:10,267 --> 01:01:12,941
What did you say, Chuck?

945
01:01:14,938 --> 01:01:19,478
I think she took my life,
and I wanna take hers.

946
01:01:19,643 --> 01:01:21,281
Boy: Just like it says
in the Bible, man,

947
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:22,514
an eye for an eye.

948
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,522
Clean this shit up
before my dad gets home.

949
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:26,354
Okay-

950
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:28,393
( snorts )

951
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:37,532
I think we got enough
for the party.

952
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:38,695
Two parties.

953
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:48,811
- Come on. Go, go, go.
- Shit.

954
01:01:48,972 --> 01:01:50,076
Go.

955
01:01:51,808 --> 01:01:54,220
Lock the door.
Don't open it.

956
01:02:02,419 --> 01:02:03,591
Hi, Dave.

957
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:06,233
What's with the ski masks?

958
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:07,663
Hitting the slopes?

959
01:02:07,824 --> 01:02:10,600
You got lots of stuff
in the car.

960
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,933
Are you going to some
big party or something?

961
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:16,009
It'll distract me
from my boredom.

962
01:02:18,768 --> 01:02:21,715
How's that? Hmm?
That wake you up?

963
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:26,581
Are you still bored?

964
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:30,551
Where's C h rissie?

965
01:02:30,714 --> 01:02:32,387
You tell me.

966
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,453
That's the spirit.

967
01:02:35,619 --> 01:02:38,395
I want in that car.

968
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:43,394
Guy, take this little
fucking scab out back.

969
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:45,403
Teach him a lesson.

970
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:47,806
( Dave screams )

971
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:49,799
Fuck!

972
01:02:49,966 --> 01:02:51,468
Get him!

973
01:02:55,405 --> 01:02:57,385
(screaming continues)

974
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:59,884
Tracy, open the door.

975
01:03:00,043 --> 01:03:03,320
Tracy, you open that door,
and I will kill you personally.

976
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,391
Leave him the fuck alone!

977
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:08,228
Fuck him up.

978
01:03:08,385 --> 01:03:09,830
( Screams )

979
01:03:09,986 --> 01:03:11,624
- ( 5t0mps)
- 0oh!

980
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:15,395
God, Dave, it looks like
it hurts so bad!

981
01:03:15,558 --> 01:03:17,834
Go and do it again.
One more time.

982
01:03:17,994 --> 01:03:18,995
Okay, do it again.
Do it again.

983
01:03:19,162 --> 01:03:20,573
( Screams )

984
01:03:22,766 --> 01:03:26,646
Leave him the fuck alone!
Leave him alone!

985
01:03:36,913 --> 01:03:39,655
You tell Mom?

986
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,659
- Not yet.
- Good. Don't.

987
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:43,422
I'm fine.
Let her have her time.

988
01:03:43,586 --> 01:03:44,997
She needs it.

989
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:47,328
You know who these guys are
and yet you do nothing.

990
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:50,437
We paid the boys a visit.
They were all nerves.

991
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:52,539
I could tell by their pupils
they were partying.

992
01:03:52,696 --> 01:03:53,936
That's great.
That's amazing.

993
01:03:54,097 --> 01:03:56,008
So what's next?
A lineup or something?

994
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:57,873
They were partying
in their homes.

995
01:03:58,034 --> 01:04:01,709
No contraband was visible and
our search warrant was rejected.

996
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:03,350
So what are you saying?

997
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:05,713
We don't have enough
to arrest them yet.

998
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:08,378
They broke his hand
in broad daylight.

999
01:04:08,545 --> 01:04:10,491
Line them up.

1000
01:04:10,647 --> 01:04:13,719
Our hands are tied here,
Chrissie. I'm sorry.

1001
01:04:15,385 --> 01:04:18,798
Please leave me with my brother.
Pleasejust go.

1002
01:04:18,955 --> 01:04:20,161
Just go.

1003
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:28,973
This is all my fault.

1004
01:04:29,132 --> 01:04:30,475
There's good news.

1005
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:32,203
What's that?

1006
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:34,508
I'm like a hero to Tracy now.

1007
01:04:34,671 --> 01:04:36,742
This is gonna go down
big for me.

1008
01:04:36,906 --> 01:04:38,476
I'm gonna milk it.
Trust me.

1009
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:40,382
It might even get me
a home run.

1010
01:04:42,078 --> 01:04:44,752
Hey, you all right?

1011
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:48,187

was creeping up behind me

and then nothing was there.

1066
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:27,775
I'll-- I'll call you
right back, okay?

1067
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:30,307
You're security?

1068
01:08:30,473 --> 01:08:32,646
I almost feel bad fucking
your shit up all over again.

1069
01:08:32,809 --> 01:08:35,722
Not me. I've been dreaming about
fucking your shit up.

( Screaming )

01:09:32,201 --> 01:09:34,772
Hmm? You scared now?

1076
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:49,056
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

1077
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:53,467
I'm sorry.

1078
01:09:53,623 --> 01:09:54,829
No, you're not.

1079
01:09:54,991 --> 01:09:58,200
- I am.
- No, you're not!

1080

01:10:09,706 --> 01:10:12,880
I was thinking about
that dream you had.

1083

Don't lie to me.

1084
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:22,188
You're so beautiful.

1085
01:10:24,654 --> 01:10:26,565
I'm so sorry.

1086
01:10:46,042 --> 01:10:47,350
Please.

1087
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:51,555

- No, you don't.

Are you okay?

1116
01:13:45,621 --> 01:13:47,897
Who taught you
how to shoot like that?

( police radio chatter)

Ian: So...

1121
01:14:59,195 --> 01:15:01,141
you just told the cops

1122
01:15:01,297 --> 01:15:03,208
that you took all those guys
down in self-defense,

1123
01:15:03,366 --> 01:15:04,845
and that's it?

1124
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:06,639
And that's it.

1125
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:13,181
You must be traumatized.

1126
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:16,721
I passed that phase yesterday.

1127
01:15:16,879 --> 01:15:19,826
So let's do a head count.

1128
01:15:19,982 --> 01:15:21,484
Not the fucking curse again.

1129
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:24,290
Seriously,
have any seniors died yet?

1130
01:15:24,453 --> 01:15:27,297
Uh, not to my knowledge.

1131
01:15:27,456 --> 01:15:30,062
So the curse
could still be real.

1132
01:15:30,226 --> 01:15:33,139
Ian, we bring this on ourselves.

1133
01:15:33,295 --> 01:15:35,536
There's no curse.

1134
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:38,872
Some drunk senior
is probably about to drive

1135
01:15:39,035 --> 01:15:41,379
into a head-on with a semi
as we speak.

1136
01:15:49,845 --> 01:15:51,256
I should--
I should go check on Bobby.

1137
01:15:51,414 --> 01:15:54,054
You're a mess.
You need to chill for a sec.

1138
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:56,522
Remember we used
to push each other

1139
01:15:56,685 --> 01:15:59,529
to see who could
get highest?

1140
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:03,729
Do you love grease boy?

1141
01:16:03,893 --> 01:16:08,501
Don't be a dick.
His name's Bobby.

1142
01:16:08,664 --> 01:16:10,405
Bobby doesn't deserve you.

1143
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:12,239
Ian...

1144
01:16:15,171 --> 01:16:16,445
Don't.

1145
01:16:18,707 --> 01:16:20,550
I've always loved you.

1146
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:51,111
- What happened?
- I was jumped.

1147
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,002

Chrissie: I feel for all
the people who grieve for me.

1151
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:37,256
And from where I stand,

1152
01:17:37,419 --> 01:17:39,490
I can say for sure
that I was wrong.

1153
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:43,333
The curse of
Downers Grove is real

1154
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:45,438
because the curse
is everywhere.

1155
01:17:45,594 --> 01:17:46,595
The curse is life.

1156
01:17:46,762 --> 01:17:48,799
Man on TV:
Another graduation called off

1157
01:17:48,964 --> 01:17:50,204
and a funeral
to take its place...

1158
01:17:50,366 --> 01:17:54,508
Chrissie: Don't expect me
to tell you to believe in fate

1159
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:58,675
or that there's some
supernatural force guiding us all.

1160
01:17:58,841 --> 01:18:00,684
I can only say this.

1161
