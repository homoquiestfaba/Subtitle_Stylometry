00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:30,910
Let's eat.

3
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,456
It looks delicious!

4
00:02:34,895 --> 00:02:36,025
So...

5
00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:37,608
You should join the training.

6
00:02:37,608 --> 00:02:41,499
Of course! You said that it's
starting this afternoon.

7
00:02:42,457 --> 00:02:47,407
I was absolutely going to go, of course.
That's why I'm here. No matter what.

8
00:02:49,305 --> 00:02:51,536
It's probably not your first kiss at age 23.

9
00:03:01,725 --> 00:03:05,925
It was just a smooch for like
middle school sweethearts.

10
00:03:06,123 --> 00:03:07,654
You're panicking.

11
00:03:14,302 --> 00:03:15,742
Who's panicking?

12
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,429
I'm not! Why would I panic over
such a petty thing!

13
00:03:20,196 --> 00:03:23,326
It's like a hello.

14
00:03:23,326 --> 00:03:24,771
It's like that for me too.

15
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,677
It's not for me.

16
00:03:28,787 --> 00:03:30,099
Huh?

17
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:34,720
I don't do it as hello.

18
00:03:37,741 --> 00:03:40,845
I'm not a easy guy like that.

19
00:03:45,137 --> 00:03:47,001
I am...

20
00:03:47,464 --> 00:03:52,504
I thought that you may feel awkward
if I put too much meaning into that.

21
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,680
It's not awkward, but it's...

22
00:03:56,816 --> 00:04:03,058
It was like a cheer up thing for the future star,
who's just made the hardest choice in her life.

23
00:04:03,397 --> 00:04:05,069
Something like that?

24
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:13,663
Then we can just enjoy the breakfast
without you laughing all weird like this right?

25
00:04:18,953 --> 00:04:20,361
Ok. Let's eat.

26
00:04:27,897 --> 00:04:31,867
You got $50,000 investment as soon as
your fund was decided.

27
00:04:31,867 --> 00:04:33,664
I think so.

28
00:04:33,664 --> 00:04:36,580
As for project B, you received $170,000
four months after.

29
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,327
Additionally you received $30,000 for project A.

30
00:04:40,327 --> 00:04:43,716
I think I took about $200,000.

31
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:47,315
You've received $320,000 total for
Projects A, B, C, and D.

32
00:04:47,315 --> 00:04:52,747
-Can I get something to drink?
-You've never made a contract for a song right?

33
00:04:53,641 --> 00:04:58,425
I did because the policies sort of changed.

34
00:04:58,425 --> 00:05:01,565
Anyways, we're getting onto it right now.

35
00:05:01,565 --> 00:05:04,533
Where's all the money you've received?

36
00:05:05,737 --> 00:05:08,553
You know there are processing costs.

37
00:05:08,553 --> 00:05:12,043
All the whiskeys and wines that you drink.
Hotels that you go...

38
00:05:14,087 --> 00:05:18,353
You know the world of creation, Representative Yu.

39
00:05:18,353 --> 00:05:20,981
I don't think people like you understand.

40
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:23,292
I don't need to know.
And I don't want to know.

41
00:05:23,292 --> 00:05:26,353
Provide evidence for your spending by next week.

42
00:05:26,353 --> 00:05:29,721
You would have to admit to embezzlement
for the ones that you can't prove.

43
00:05:29,721 --> 00:05:32,887
Hey man, you know?

44
00:05:32,887 --> 00:05:37,566
Then you would have to first find out
if I spent all that $320,000.

45
00:05:38,476 --> 00:05:39,945
What do you mean?

46
00:05:41,664 --> 00:05:43,278
Exactly as I said.

47
00:05:44,171 --> 00:05:47,799
You know you weren't the one that
ran this fund in the beginning.

48
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:52,119
When I got the money,
it was when the other Rep Yu was around.

49
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:56,081
That guy! Your cousin.
Yu Jae Joon.

50
00:05:57,995 --> 00:06:01,883
Didn't he tell you anything?

51
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:15,968
Can you hear that? You know those guys are
pretty new themselves.

52
00:06:16,248 --> 00:06:19,304
Someone like you can even call
FF or 20 Body and ...

53
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,917
-Let's talk after you see her!
-That's why I'm saying FF or 20 Body...

54
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,394
Can you even afford those guys?

55
00:06:27,394 --> 00:06:31,275
If it's working with Hong Jae Yi,
who would even ask for money?

56
00:06:32,603 --> 00:06:34,798
Stop using your throat but
use your breath instead!

57
00:06:34,798 --> 00:06:36,729
Oh, you're here!

58
00:06:36,993 --> 00:06:39,159
This is Go Eun Bi.
This is Producer Gu Jak.

59
00:06:39,542 --> 00:06:40,542
Say hi.

60
00:06:41,336 --> 00:06:43,938
Ms. Go Eun Bi.
Nice to meet you.

61
00:06:43,938 --> 00:06:48,486
-Nice to meet you.
-Oh yes.

62
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:53,934
Shouldn't the corporations sponsor
cultural movements?

63
00:06:53,934 --> 00:06:59,574
A big corporation such as this,
giving such a meager amount of money...

64
00:07:00,249 --> 00:07:04,706
then asking what? Investment? Profit?

65
00:07:04,706 --> 00:07:07,507
That's not right.

66
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:13,468
Is it no-smoking?

67
00:07:19,127 --> 00:07:20,546
Take a look.

68
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:27,812
This is when the lead actress runs out to the
center of the stage in shock.

69
00:07:27,812 --> 00:07:29,832
It's the theme song.

70
00:07:34,831 --> 00:07:41,461
<i>~It's not. It's not love.
Absolutely not. ~</i>

71
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:45,996
<i>~Whenever I see you.~</i>

72
00:07:45,996 --> 00:07:48,835
Your heart is being stumbled
by the man whom you thought you couldn't love.

73
00:07:49,627 --> 00:07:53,796
<i>~But my heart. My love. ~</i>

74
00:07:54,096 --> 00:07:57,976
<i>~Whenver I call you it swift wind blows by. ~</i>

75
00:07:57,976 --> 00:08:05,686
<i>~Since when was it? Since it became silver platter. ~</i>

76
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:09,756
<i>~Since when was it?~</i>

77
00:08:10,105 --> 00:08:15,345
<i>~The excitement that I'm feeling for the first time.~</i>

78
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:22,734
<i>~Even if I try to turn my head
and look away from you.~</i>

79
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:31,401
<i>~Even if I shake my body and shake
off the silver fox fur...~</i>

80
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:39,853
<i>~I find myself holding you in my arms.~</i>

81
00:08:40,784 --> 00:08:44,343
<i>~Your wound that only I know.~</i>

82
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:49,536
<i>~Your wound that I hold in my arms.~</i>

83
00:08:57,214 --> 00:09:00,900
I don't think I should sing it like this.

84
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:10,301
It's beating quite excitedly right?

85
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,827
You like the song?

86
00:09:20,901 --> 00:09:23,788
Is there someone that can impress
Hong Jae Yi in Korea?

87
00:09:28,112 --> 00:09:29,549
Hello!

88
00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:31,281
Do you know me?

89
00:09:34,004 --> 00:09:40,816
Your songs, I mean your work.
I know all of them.

90
00:09:42,107 --> 00:09:45,950
Thank you. Now will you excuse us?

91
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,817
I have something to discuss with him.

92
00:09:48,817 --> 00:09:50,769
The door was open.

93
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,561
We're doing lessons right now.

94
00:09:55,561 --> 00:10:02,462
That's ok. I'll just leave.
You guys have your conversation.

95
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:18,803
You shouldn't play around with kids.

96
00:10:18,803 --> 00:10:23,145
If you say that you're not just playing around,
with someone like that then it's insulting me.

97
00:10:25,284 --> 00:10:27,622
Say what you want and leave.

98
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,237
Just take a seat!

99
00:10:39,237 --> 00:10:42,974
If we want to cover it,
we can cover the whole thing.

100
00:10:42,974 --> 00:10:46,654
You know funds with that big of a size,
taking some money out for mutual benefits is...

101
00:10:47,016 --> 00:10:51,639
Isn't it Father? When can there be a
deal without a broker's fee?

102
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:55,580
I said that it's not important whether you
took the money or you didn't.

103
00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:00,548
The important part is whether it will be known
that you took the money or you didn't.

104
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,710
That's what's...

105
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,610
Since when were you here?
You didn't even let us know.

106
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,580
You were talking.

107
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:12,280
- Who taught you manners...
-Sit.

108
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:25,350
I heard that you were taking care of the fund
Jae Joon used to work on.

109
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:28,380
Yes, they all expired.

110
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:34,210
I think Jae Joon made some mistakes
during the beginning of the fund.

111
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,250
Father those weren't mistakes.

112
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,610
Yes, they weren't mistakes.

113
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:43,228
If you call investing 3 to 4 times for a company
that has no intention of performing,

114
00:11:43,228 --> 00:11:46,569
You should say that him doing business
at all is a mistake.

115
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,810
Hey!

116
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,980
It was a mistake. Jae Joon's mistake.

117
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,050
Father,

118
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:05,010
We let you run the fund believing
that you may put it back on course.

119
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:09,050
So, if you just blame Jae Joon for his mistakes,

120
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:13,950
you're just as incapable as he is.

121
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,210
Uncle.

122
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:21,310
In baseball, if the pitcher makes the bases loaded,

123
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,410
and leaves the game to the substitute pitcher,
the stats will be recorded...

124
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:29,550
Yes, on the first pitcher.
He will have the runs in his stats.

125
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:32,950
However, the pitcher that gets in the game
when the bases are loaded.

126
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:39,510
Takes a hit and losing the game is something
anyone can do.

127
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,380
What kind of a pitcher are you?

128
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:45,580
Are you the one that gets three strikes?

129
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:48,480
Saving the team and the face of the first pitcher?

130
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,210
You take the win.

131
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,610
Show everyone your ability.

132
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:57,010
Isn't that the way to build your career?

133
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,650
So, you're coming back to musicals with that song?

134
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:11,580
Umm... yeah.

135
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:19,150
If you don't like Rep Yu,
you can just do it with me alone.

136
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:22,050
As long as you say you're coming back.

137
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:27,550
Do you know what it means that you and I
are starting the musical again?

138
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,780
You already know clearly.

139
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:36,480
Yes. It's because I'm fully aware of what it means.

140
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:49,950
To Hong Jae Yi, musical is Bae Kang Hee.

141
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,280
Bae Kang Hee is musical.

142
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:01,150
That's what I'm trying to get rid of.

143
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,780
Help me.

144
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,950
Help you with what?

145
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,110
Help you try to get away from me?

146
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:12,180
You're the one who left me.

147
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:16,610
At that time...you know that
that was the only choice for me.

148
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:19,450
You admitted so yourself.

149
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,910
Because you loved yourself so much,

150
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:26,410
You chose to marry your husband.

151
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,650
There's no man.

152
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:34,410
No man that can have all of Bae Kang Hee.

153
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,980
But...

154
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,550
I can give you the big part.

155
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,710
No.

156
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,580
I left because I hate complicated things.
And now...

157
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,080
So?

158
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,050
Has it become simple?

159
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,710
Not yet.

160
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,950
Because of that girl earlier?

161
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,080
Maybe...

162
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:07,010
I don't know.
I wonder if it can be that simple.

163
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:18,880
I just hate irresponsible people
who care about nothing but themselves.

164
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,010
There are plenty of those people.

165
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:26,980
Especially in the field we're working on.

166
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:30,280
Talent.

167
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:35,050
If they can't use it for others,
for the world,

168
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:37,280
Then it's just useless.

169
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,814
That's why people like you should help them so that
they can use their talent

170
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:44,803
By investing money and giving them opportunities.

171
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:50,210
Have you gotten a call from someone?

172
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:53,380
I always get calls.

173
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:58,110
-President Han.
-Representative Yu.

174
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:03,680
Because of selfish people who only love
themselves, and who only do what they want to do,

175
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,380
Because of people who act and sing even
though they are starving,

176
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:10,750
We're here today.

177
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:15,610
In the process, injustice could happen.

178
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:18,550
There are situations that we can never understand.

179
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:21,710
Once the curtains unveil and the audience applauds,

180
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,710
you tend to forget everything.

181
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,450
Everything gets covered.

182
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:32,410
What do you want me to do?

183
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:35,510
You don't have to do something for me.

184
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:39,480
I'm just saying that you don't
have to be so tough on everyone.

185
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,680
That was sick! Did you see that?

186
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,880
When the lead actress came up after about 42 minutes.

187
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,610
I'm not a bad person. Don't hit me.

188
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:30,110
I just wanted to earn my way.
We're all the same people.

189
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:32,250
Did you memorize it by watching it just once?

190
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,110
That's so cool.

191
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:37,280
For people like me, it gets straight into
my head after just watching it once.

192
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,910
It's not something anyone can do.

193
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:39,980
What's interesting is that...

194
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,250
The scene right after. The poem.

195
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,350
The poem was from the roof scene.

196
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:49,110
What are you talking about? Do you know
how many times I've watched this?

197
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,910
You said it was your first time!

198
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:54,280
You said that you memorized
it after watching it once.

199
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,710
That's not what's important here.

200
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:04,680
The point here is that, the next scene is
the mountain scene.

201
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,310
It's not.

202
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:11,350
You wanna bet?

203
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,980
The loser gets to take everyone out
tonight for a full course dinner.

204
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,950
Call.

205
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:20,280
You've invested on a company
that performed once in 1991.

206
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:24,610
Now you're saying that
you've invested in their potential?

207
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,710
Director Lee, who has produced
"The Man of the King,"

208
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:31,556
is a man who has never produced in 15 years.

209
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,180
For artists, miracles seldom occur.

210
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,380
Representative Yu!

211
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,150
They say that you're the venomous snake
in the field.

212
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,650
You know better than anyone that Yu Jae Joon
is not the man who would invest knowing these.

213
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,710
How dare you to play dumb?

214
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:49,110
You always talk about honest,
public entrepreneurship.

215
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:53,110
It's always the same family business,
dirty crap kept within family.

216
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:56,050
It's negative 37% on the 50 million fund.

217
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:58,080
That's 20 million dollars.

218
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,610
Didn't you guys take all of these?

219
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:07,661
The agreement that we will minimize the loss on
Dae Hak Ro fund is still in effect.

220
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:13,453
I hope everyone understands that we had put in
our utmost attention to Amour Fund.

221
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:15,650
Hold on.
Let's just hear this out.

222
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,150
Amour Fund is still going well.

223
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,850
But still.

224
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:22,864
How can the 10 million dollar budget for Amour Fund
cover the loss of 50 million dollars?

225
00:19:22,864 --> 00:19:24,880
Do you know what the profit should be then?

226
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,150
300%

227
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:31,380
Are you confident that you can make 300% profit?

228
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,280
Let's start all over tomorrow.

229
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,550
What time can you come?

230
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,680
We already decided to practice together.

231
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,550
I feel that practicing in the office is best.

232
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,950
Guests come to your house and stuff...

233
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:11,410
Kang Hee...

234
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,350
Used to be a very special person to me.

235
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:17,680
I understand very well.

236
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,380
Bae Kang Hee, even to me,
is a stunning person.

237
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,950
She really is cool.

238
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,350
Hey.

239
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,450
You should listen!

240
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,250
She USED TO BE a special person.

241
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,380
USED TO BE.

242
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,750
That's not the only reason.

243
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,710
Bok Ja too.

244
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:46,550
Anyways, I think it's best that I practice in
the office, teacher.

245
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:49,210
-Eun Bi!
-Teacher!

246
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,680
Like you said.

247
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,110
I made the hardest decision in my life.

248
00:20:55,110 --> 00:21:00,697
I gave up everything for the musical.
So I want to focus only on the musical.

249
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,480
Goodnight.

250
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:25,280
She's saying that she thinks of me enough to
have her bothered, even for musical.

251
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,910
<i>Where are you?</i>

252
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,650
I'm wrapping it up.

253
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:18,780
<i>I heard that you defended very well.</i>

254
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,210
Who did you hear that from?

255
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:24,680
Good news travels fast.

256
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,410
It's Soo Ryung's birthday.
Sorry I can't be with you.

257
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:30,350
You want to come?

258
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:33,050
You know Jae Hoon right? Soo Ryung's fiance.

259
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:35,210
Jung Suh and Seul Ki's boyfriend.

260
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,680
What?

261
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:42,580
I still have to finish work here.

262
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,150
Sorry.

263
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,950
Have fun and go home safely.

264
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:47,880
Ok. You go home safely too, Sweetie.

265
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,310
Yeah.

266
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,080
I don't know.

267
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,910
Among the packages that's going to my place,
I think your Grandma packed some for you too.

268
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,980
I think she packed this and that.

269
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,810
It's ok if you're late.

270
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:08,650
I'll just wait for you at home.

271
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,550
Yes, I got it.

272
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,610
Ok.

273
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,480
Bye.

274
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,480
Oh yeah, Kwang Suh.

275
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,510
There's a friend at my place.

276
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,650
She's quite weird.

277
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,480
Hey... Hey...

278
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,980
Traffic accident.

279
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,550
The leg over there. And the arm here.

280
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:40,250
And the fracture on the shoulder. Be extra careful.

281
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,610
I know. Don't worry.

282
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:44,980
And from here on, it's better.

283
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,365
Natural death here.

284
00:23:47,365 --> 00:23:49,011
Suicide here.

285
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,267
Ok.

286
00:23:50,267 --> 00:23:54,280
If we get caught, you will lose your job.
And I'll be... Right?

287
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,250
I know. Don't worry.

288
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,810
It's not our first time.

289
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:59,080
Be careful then.

290
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,880
Yes.

291
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,980
How much money do you get per person?

292
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,580
Per body?

293
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:47,850
We don't call dead people people.
Per body.

294
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:53,247
So you've been washing them with that hand?

295
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,750
Come on...

296
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,250
It's normally not allowed.

297
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,780
The forensics must do it themselves.

298
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:10,350
I'm just doing it because of an
upper class man that I know. So you can't tell anyone.

299
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:13,080
That's illegal then!

300
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,980
So that!

301
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:19,910
How much do you get paid per body?

302
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:22,210
Why? You want to help me out?

303
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:27,080
Yes! I'll lend you money.

304
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,880
Did she make all of these?

305
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,080
Look at the fruits! (expensive in Korea)

306
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,280
They sent all this from Dae Gu?

307
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,350
I don't think it has to do with you.

308
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:41,010
You're so mean.

309
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:43,380
I live with Eun Bi under the same roof.

310
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,010
Aren't you her friend?

311
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:49,310
We're practically a family here!

312
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,510
Umm...

313
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:53,180
I'll just wait here until Eun Bi gets back.

314
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,680
Come on.

315
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,250
What's the rush?

316
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,250
You're quite good looking.

317
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,380
Name?

318
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,810
Kwang Suh. Hyun Kwang Suh.

319
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:05,750
Kwang Suh.

320
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:11,250
It's all about making a living.

321
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:15,650
It's not like it's hospital bill for someone dying.

322
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:18,510
It's just about means to get through.

323
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,450
I have a fully able body.
If I have to borrow money

324
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:23,250
Just for means to get through,
that's just being lazy.

325
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:26,810
You talk so funny...

326
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:29,550
This is how my Grandma talks.

327
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:34,710
It's all right, and it's all good.

328
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,280
But you don't have time.

329
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,180
If you want to get better before the competition,

330
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:42,550
I'll make sure that I won't miss practice.

331
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:47,280
-Is it ego?
-It could be that too.

332
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:58,610
That tastes so good.
She is so good at cooking.

333
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:00,180
There are so many kinds of food.

334
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,780
I can smell her family cooking already.

335
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:07,280
It's so good.
How often does she send these?

336
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:11,680
I hope she sends them often.

337
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:16,410
Among the following which one shows the...

338
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:27,610
I'll help Aunt cleaning up. You guys talk.

339
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,880
You don't need to help.

340
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,450
You're not married yet.

341
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:33,010
We have plenty of people here.

342
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:38,650
Yes. It's been a while seeing you.
Just stay here.

343
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,850
Yes sir.

344
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:41,810
I heard that you cooked that shrimp today!

345
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:44,680
That was really good.

346
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:51,050
Jin! The best thing you did in your life
was getting Ra Kyung.

347
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:52,980
I'm the one who's lucky here.

348
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,450
Don't be like that.

349
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:56,250
Everyone knows that here already.

350
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:59,080
It's a marriage that your family has a lot to lose.

351
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,480
Aren't you going to set up the wedding date?

352
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,880
We're not anxious yet.

353
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,580
In Jin's position, it is something to be anxious about.

354
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:10,110
He is not making any contributions to the family.

355
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:14,439
Shouldn't he at least settle to make his
in-laws happy?

356
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,650
Exactly.

357
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:23,850
There are good news about him wrapping up
well on the fund conference.

358
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:28,010
My Father was especially happy.

359
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:30,750
Your Father is so generous.

360
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:33,150
You should have attended the conference at least.

361
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:37,980
Because I had to talk in your position,
it sounded like I was making excuses.

362
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:42,023
You should have stood up yourself and made
statements about your investments.

363
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,280
You're the one who boasted and took the project.

364
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:53,950
Had I finished the project, it wouldn't have been
that bad you know.

365
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,650
By the way,

366
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:16,610
is it alright for you to not work like this?

367
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:18,380
Huh?

368
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:22,850
If you're staying out of the business,
Father won't be too happy.

369
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:26,680
Father and company?

370
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:32,250
If you say that you're just going to paint,
because you've been married to me.

371
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:35,680
Father will hate his daughter-in-law.

372
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:41,650
He may even hate our child later.

373
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:44,480
He won't.

374
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,080
It's alright.

375
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,650
That's good then.

376
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,750
Our child.

377
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:06,900
I'm really scared of Uncle.

378
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:13,350
I think he's being too harsh on you.

379
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:20,650
That's because my father always beat him.
And Grandpa never acknowledged him.

380
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:27,980
Grandpa always put the younger son, my father,
on top of Uncle.

381
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:31,750
Then one day, that mighty younger brother,

382
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:34,850
disappeared all of the sudden. Throwing everything away.

383
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:36,980
Because he wanted to paint.

384
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:40,210
But that's all in the past.

385
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:44,150
I'm really ok.

386
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:46,850
It's not like it happened once.

387
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:49,450
But still! Aren't you angry?

388
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:53,810
You've cleaned up the mess
your cousin made so well.

389
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:56,210
He's not even thankful.

390
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:59,880
Go in. You did a good job.

391
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:04,110
Tomorrow is the competition right?

392
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:06,180
See you tomorrow.

393
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,150
Don't get anxious!

394
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:46,210
You know what I mean right?

395
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:49,210
You know...
Don't think of it as an audition.

396
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:51,610
Practice like it's real. And do the real like what?

397
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:54,310
-Practice.
-Right like practice. Easy does it.

398
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,780
What's more important?

399
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:58,250
Don't get anxious! Don't be anxious and take it down.

400
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,380
You can do it! You can!

401
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,410
You're the one who's anxious here.

402
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:05,350
By the way...
Isn't Hong Jae Yi coming?

403
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:08,010
Shouldn't he play the song himself?

404
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:10,180
-Hey!
-You scared me!

405
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:13,210
Didn't I say not to mention Hong Jae Yi?

406
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:14,650
What are you going to do if others hear it?

407
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:17,091
His only condition was that his name
won't be put up on the work!

408
00:33:17,091 --> 00:33:19,710
That was his only condition!

409
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:22,310
As soon as people find out that Hong Jae Yi
did our songs, he will leave.

410
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,780
Do you understand?

411
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,410
Don't ever talk about his name again.

412
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:26,180
OK.

413
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:29,710
For one to be this dumb,
it's not called sympathy. But hard beating.

414
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,750
You...

415
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,980
No, no, no.

416
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,410
The important thing here is that.

417
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:37,950
Oh yeah, Eun Bi.

418
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,510
Our lead actress.

419
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:42,180
Don't feel burdened.

420
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,210
You're doing half of it.

421
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:44,050
You know what I mean right?

422
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:46,310
Just do as you normally do it.

423
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,350
You know... Just do it as usual.

424
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,650
I'll take care of him.

425
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:51,450
You guys practice.

426
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:54,250
Don't let him come back today.

427
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:02,050
Ok get together.

428
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:57,450
Yes, teacher.

429
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:00,050
Next next!

430
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,680
It's alright.

431
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,610
No, I'm alright.

432
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:08,066
You're almost here right?

433
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:13,250
Even if I don't do well, the piece is great.

434
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,750
Yes.

435
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:17,680
OK, sure.

436
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:24,680
My friend.

437
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:28,010
He met a person.

438
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:35,280
<i>~Until now, he is still in my heart.~</i>

439
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:44,813
<i>~One letter from your name. One letter from mine.
That's how we were going to name our...~</i>

440
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:59,628
<i>~Singing, singing, sing with me.
In the morning...~</i>

441
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,610
<i>~Please remember me.~</i>

442
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:06,650
<i>~That's when the music comes out.~</i>

443
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:10,980
<i>~Song in the morning.~</i>

444
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:17,950
<i>~Song in the morning.~</i>

445
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:24,710
How do you like it Representative Yu?

446
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:29,580
Listening to one piece and the story
won't make it sound as good as the full musical.

447
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,950
I already like 2 pieces.

448
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:36,413
If it can impress Yu Jin in 15 minutes,
that's already global standards.

449
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,380
That won't be so easy.

450
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,280
How can you be full with just a shot?

451
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,050
Ok. next!

452
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,650
Hello!

453
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:48,610
Hello!

454
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:51,450
She's the co-actress next to the lead actress.

455
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:53,180
It's called "Dog Tail"

456
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:56,110
It's all a funny character.

457
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,580
Sister.

458
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:02,250
One, Two, Three, thank you.

459
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:20,950
Like it says on the synopsis.

460
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:24,580
The lead actress feels love from the lead actor
the first time.

461
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:27,980
She is trembling.

462
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:31,010
Let's begin.

463
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:49,710
<i>~For all those times.~</i>

464
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:53,680
<i>~Until I got here...~</i>

465
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,610
<i>~Through milleniums...~</i>

466
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:02,650
<i>~I still live here.~</i>

467
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:07,050
<i>~All the time, that I have endured.~</i>

468
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:10,610
<i>~It was all for this one person.~</i>

469
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:14,350
<i>~I always told myself to not fall in love.~</i>

470
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:18,110
<i>~I couldn't love anyone.~</i>

471
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:24,650
<i>~But ever since I saw you for the first time.~</i>

472
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:31,750
<i>~The time stopped. And the love grows.~</i>

473
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:38,510
<i>~Long lonely love compared to the millenium.~</i>

474
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:49,350
<i>~My footsteps towards you!
My heart is to you!~</i>

475
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:53,050
<i>~No matter how hard I try to look away.~</i>

476
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:57,550
<i>~There's only one thing that I want.~</i>

477
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:01,980
<i>~I can't stop right here.~</i>

478
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,950
<i>~My love...~</i>

479
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:10,980
<i>~Or you... I'll tell everything today.~</i>

480
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:15,750
<i>~I'll say it with my one last breath.~</i>

481
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:26,480
<i>~You are my only love.~</i>

482
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:46,650
Only two?

483
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:51,910
We have two more.
But the writer wants to edit them some more.

484
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:54,150
Who's the song writer?

485
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:57,810
It doesn't say here.

486
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:03,350
The writer... actually...

487
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:04,910
Hey!

488
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:08,094
The role is Doha. What's your name?

489
00:41:08,094 --> 00:41:11,350
It's Go Eun Bi.

490
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:13,510
The song is very good.

491
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:15,580
But isn't the key too low?

492
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:20,010
It's the lead actress song.
But it sounds like a guy's song.

493
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,350
Can we take it up some keys?

494
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:24,610
But, the music isn't ready...

495
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:27,310
Eun Young. Take it up half a note.

496
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:34,202
Take another key higher?

497
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:40,450
That's good.

498
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:49,614
<i>~The only thing that I want is!~</i>

499
00:41:49,614 --> 00:41:51,080
Like this.

500
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:55,156
I don't think that will match Go Eun Bi's.

501
00:41:55,156 --> 00:41:57,910
We can always edit the song later.

502
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:59,650
Really?

503
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:01,280
But if a girl wants to do musical.

504
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,650
Shouldn't she be able to sing this much at least?

505
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:10,310
Can I have a try?

506
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:17,080
No. I want to listen to it with Go Eun Bi's voice.

507
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:29,910
Yes ma'am. I'll try that.

508
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:40,980
<i>~The only thing that I want is!~</i>

509
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:45,350
<i>~But I can't stop.~</i>

510
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:49,580
<i>~My love...~</i>

511
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:54,280
<i>~I'll be honest with all of my feelings today.~</i>

512
00:42:54,280 --> 00:43:01,050
<i>~I will say it with my one last breath.~</i>

513
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:07,380
<i>~You're my only love.~</i>

514
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,580
Enough.

515
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,280
That's good enough.

516
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:16,150
The song is really good. The singing is...

517
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:19,210
I can't bear it.

518
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:20,910
I'm sorry.

519
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:24,450
It's ok. We're not auditioning for actress here.

520
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:28,450
Is it that the company is that poor to have
an actress who's not ready to come up?

521
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:31,375
Or were you taking this lightly?

522
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:35,110
It's not like that.

523
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:38,550
The key was set for her.

524
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:45,010
So if you get sponsored here,
will you have her as the lead actress?

525
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:48,550
We only need to talk about the piece here.

526
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:50,550
- First...
- Musical pieces...

527
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:55,050
are things that need lots of hands
in order to have their lives prolonged.

528
00:43:55,050 --> 00:44:01,010
We can't be sponsoring on a song like this,
that's been written to suit one person.

529
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:04,750
No matter how good the piece is,
if it's like this...

530
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:07,650
Wouldn't there be problems with sponsoring?

531
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:10,550
It's not that.

532
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:15,097
Yes it's me.
I was the one who lowered the keys.

533
00:44:15,097 --> 00:44:18,255
Other actresses can sing it with high tones.

534
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:23,680
It's not high.
It's normal.

535
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:29,280
Yes. It's normal.

536
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:32,950
I can't take it anymore.

537
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:37,930
Seriously. You don't even have the basics.
How dare you to...

538
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:41,009
If you don't have talent, you should give up.

539
00:44:41,009 --> 00:44:44,680
Aren't you ashamed?

540
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:49,910
I'm sorry.

541
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:55,010
You've given me the opportunity.
I'm not ashamed.

542
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:57,450
-I am sorry.
-It's fine.

543
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:02,050
The professionals hate the word "sorry."

544
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:05,910
Be responsible and quit.

545
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:13,150
Having not enough talent is enough.
Don't ask for forgiveness. I hate such rudeness.

546
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,110
Kang Hee!

547
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,710
Let's take a 10 minute break.

548
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:34,450
Kang Hee.

549
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:43,510
Is something wrong?

550
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:45,965
I want to see Bae Kang Hee for a sec.

551
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:49,980
What she said as a judge...

552
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:53,696
It's not because of that.

553
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,750
I...

554
00:45:57,910 --> 00:46:02,350
I wanted to get her autograph.

555
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:23,950
What's going on?

556
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:28,110
Excuse me...

557
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:33,950
This is embarrassing.

558
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:35,050
Let's go already.

559
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:36,810
We should wait for Eun Bi!

560
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:39,780
We just went through an embarassment all because of her.

561
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:41,450
Let's just go.

562
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:46,373
How come you become such a pain when
Hong Jae Yi isn't around?

563
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:51,880
Forget it.
Let's just go to a cafe or something.

564
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:57,580
Let's go to a cafe.
Text Eun Bi to come.

565
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:06,750
Is it that you have guts?
Or that you have no shame?

566
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:11,050
Or are you stupid?
Or are you really smart?

567
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:18,780
And are you inferring that I'm ok no matter
what kinds of insults you throw at me?

568
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:22,650
It's not that.

569
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:33,510
When this book first came out,
I stood in line to buy this.

570
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,550
I read it more than my textbook.

571
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,750
I read it with more attention.

572
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,910
The reason I dreamed about musicals.

573
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:49,010
And the reason that kept me going was all
this book right here.

574
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:53,280
When I saw you...
I wanted to get an autograph.

575
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:58,380
I just wanted to make a good impression.

576
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:13,350
Although it was quite heartbreaking today,
it's become really hard to see you again.

577
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:16,010
But next time,

578
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:20,310
I'll practice even harder and be here.

579
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,710
That's really touching.

580
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:37,850
I'll be cheering for you.

581
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:45,435
Thank you!

582
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:52,984
-Why did you?
-Let's start again.

583
00:48:52,984 --> 00:48:54,638
How many do we have left?

584
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:34,180
So, by how much did she raise the key?

585
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:43,200
What about Eun Bi?

586
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:52,470
I see. I'll see you at the office.

587
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:10,250
<i>The number you've dialed...</i>

588
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:17,550
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

589
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:21,550
Go Eun Bi.
You're not someone who can't sing.

590
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,850
You're definitely not someone not qualified
for doing musicals.

591
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:29,750
And also.

592
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,352
About how you stood until the end.

593
00:50:32,352 --> 00:50:35,078
Thank you!

594
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:11,780
Are you alright?

595
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,910
I am alright, thank you.

596
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:19,610
Did something happen during the competition?

597
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:22,550
No.

598
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:28,580
I sang really happily.

599
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:32,771
In front of the person that I respect the most.

600
00:51:32,771 --> 00:51:37,150
I sang the song I really liked.

601
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:44,810
Thank you!

602
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:03,010
Are you going to watch the whole thing?

603
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:07,310
I didn't edit. It's really long.

604
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:13,350
No. I just need to watch one of them.
It should be the 7th.

605
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:17,910
The title is... "Chung Dam Dong's Nine Tails. "

606
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:20,880
It's the one they did when I was out.

607
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:23,980
Kang Hee had a strange reaction to it.

608
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:26,950
-Who says that?
-Director Cha who shot the film.

609
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:34,180
Although Kang Hee isn't the nicest person,
he said that she was especially hard on them.

610
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:38,710
What did you make with for this?

611
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:41,550
Something there.

612
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,380
You should have just asked me to do it.

613
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:48,250
You said that guys who can't cook
are not even guys.

614
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:51,480
Who says that?

615
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:05,150
-Her!
-Shh!

616
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:27,350
<i>A piece like this,
can be put on a big stage on a bigger scale.</i>

617
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:31,150
You don't want to sponsor them, but
make a full production investment?

618
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,537
That's right.
The content is interesting.

619
00:53:34,537 --> 00:53:36,371
Music is even better.

620
00:53:36,371 --> 00:53:40,613
And in my opinion, this "Chung Dam Dong Nine Tails"
has a very good Asian taste to it.

621
00:53:40,613 --> 00:53:42,768
It can be even be exported worldwide.

622
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:48,580
Let's make a piece that will earn us the money.

623
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:52,650
If it can happen.
What could I possibly ask for?

624
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:56,282
But...
The reason they hid the writer --

625
00:53:56,282 --> 00:53:59,316
We should check if there are problems.

626
00:53:59,316 --> 00:54:03,080
We will have to see if it's original.

627
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:05,951
There are no other problems except you.

628
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:07,350
What?

629
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:11,461
Us buying the song and producing it.
There are no problems.

630
00:54:11,461 --> 00:54:24,080
I'm just not sure if you will continue liking the piece,
after you've found out who wrote the songs.

631
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:27,005
Who's the writer that's impressed you so much?

632
00:55:37,450 --> 00:55:40,880
Is this Representative Gu Jak?
This is Yu Jin from Amour Fund.

633
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:44,580
Yes I saw you at the competition.

634
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:50,889
Don't worry about me.
What she said was all true.

635
00:55:51,568 --> 00:55:55,219
It is wrong.
I didn't write the song just for anyone.

636
00:55:55,219 --> 00:55:57,995
I won't edit it to suit others' voices either.

637
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:00,191
It's not like that.

638
00:56:00,191 --> 00:56:04,061
It's a good piece.
Make it suitable for a lot of people.

639
00:56:04,061 --> 00:56:06,616
Lots of people watching it. Isn't that great?

640
00:56:06,616 --> 00:56:09,140
This is a song that suited Go Eun Bi!

641
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:11,365
Geez!

642
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:16,161
Anyway the objective was,
to get this piece sponsored.

643
00:56:16,161 --> 00:56:18,280
As long as we accomplish that.

644
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:22,161
And as long as I get better like it's been scheduled.

645
00:56:22,161 --> 00:56:24,462
Doha in "Chung Dang Dong Nine Tails."

646
00:56:24,462 --> 00:56:26,324
What?

647
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:31,950
It's me. Is it out already?

648
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:37,510
What?

649
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:42,010
He wants to go big scale from the start.

650
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:42,710
You know?

651
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:46,910
The Jin Dynasty background.
And the Roman Empire background.

652
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:52,310
What lines do we need? We just need to put
it up on the stage!

653
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,380
They don't want to sponsor it. But
they want to produce it themselves?

654
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:58,050
Yes! Co-producing.

655
00:56:58,210 --> 00:57:00,810
-Forget it.
-Jae Yi.

656
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:06,400
I'm really sorry to break your dreams.
You know Yu Jin?

657
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,319
If he finds out that I'm the one who wrote the song -

658
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:09,750
He does.

659
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:12,350
He already knew.

660
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:16,310
So his condition was that you write all of the songs.

661
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:17,580
Jae Yi.

662
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:22,510
To me this is like,
jackpot in a lottery.

663
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,250
It's like getting the apartment.

664
00:57:25,410 --> 00:57:29,007
It's like Jeon Ji Hyun falling for me on a blind date.
And her wanting to be in my shows.

665
00:57:29,007 --> 00:57:34,410
It's like all of these happening at once.

666
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:39,150
They want to put in 4 million for my music.

667
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:29,010
<i>~I will say all of the things honestly today.~</i>

668
00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:33,980
<i>~My last...~</i>

669
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:41,880
<i>~My last...~</i>

670
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:49,880
<i>~My last breath will tell it.~</i>

671
00:58:50,010 --> 00:59:12,310
<i>~He is my only love.~</i>

672
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:57,810
That's good.

673
00:59:57,980 --> 01:00:02,480
This song is yours.

674
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:07,450
Should I make it so that only you can sing it?

675
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:10,880
You have no idea how good the kids are
at singing.

676
01:00:11,050 --> 01:00:13,310
No...

677
01:00:13,450 --> 01:00:17,050
I'll make it recognizable by everyone.

678
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:25,310
This song is written by Hong Jae Yi for Bae Kang Hee.

679
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:30,410
Others won't be able to sing it.

680
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:05,971
Yes.

681
01:01:15,850 --> 01:01:17,880
What is this?

682
01:01:18,010 --> 01:01:19,150
This?

683
01:01:19,633 --> 01:01:21,072
What do you mean by 'this'?

684
01:01:26,772 --> 01:01:37,772
