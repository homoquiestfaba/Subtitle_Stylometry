You don't make such a good santa

1016
01:13:21,811 --> 01:13:23,412
Because all the elves

1017
01:13:23,412 --> 01:13:25,175
All those people get the money

1018
01:13:26,082 --> 01:13:28,312
Listen to me...

1019
01:13:28,551 --> 01:13:30,686
Santa isn't something you can take

1020
01:13:30,686 --> 01:13:33,018
It is something that chooses you

1021
01:13:34,323 --> 01:13:36,120

It's been just a few minutes?
- Yeah

1030
01:14:24,006 --> 01:14:25,274
Of ocuse it was only a few minutes

1031
01:14:25,274 --> 01:14:26,976
But it takes a few minutes
to see the tuth

1032
01:14:26,976 --> 01:14:28,944
To the entie life
- I don't undestand

1033
01:14:36,352 --> 01:14:38,721
...that's big that's huge, that's huge

1034
01:14:38,721 --> 01:14:40,256
And it's a lot of pessue

1035
01:14:40,256 --> 01:14:41,857
I mean taking cae of all the
childen of the wold

1036
01:14:41,857 --> 01:14:44,382
...and the north pole

1037
01:14:47,563 --> 01:14:50,191
I was in love with them

1038
01:14:50,766 --> 01:14:53,098
I gotta say hello to baby

1039
01:14:54,336 --> 01:14:57,737
I love being santa claus i love you

1040
01:14:58,707 --> 01:15:01,844

No

1045
01:15:12,588 --> 01:15:13,789
We ticked each othe off

1046
01:15:13,789 --> 01:15:15,991
But that's just like families
all ove the wold

1047
01:15:15,991 --> 01:15:17,493
They doing chistmas eve,
they love each othe

1048
01:15:17,493 --> 01:15:18,961
Tick each othe off

1049
01:15:18,961 --> 01:15:21,597
And it's ok, because we don't
need a perfectly good family

1050
01:15:21,597 --> 01:15:25,192
We just've to be... take it

1051
01:15:25,534 --> 01:15:31,640
I'm still so very sory that we just
added all this pessue that you unde

1052
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:34,577
