1
00:00:01,777 --> 00:00:04,694
(soft chime music)

2
00:00:31,355 --> 00:00:34,105
(dramatic music)

3
00:00:44,918 --> 00:00:47,585
(ominous music)

4
00:03:18,783 --> 00:03:20,659
Thanks guys, for comin' over.

5
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,421
That's what we're here for.

6
00:03:22,422 --> 00:03:23,753
We should've gone over to Rick's house

7
00:03:23,754 --> 00:03:25,389
and bashed in his windshield.

8
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,267
Pam!

9
00:03:26,268 --> 00:03:28,016
Do you really think that's
what Kelly needs right now?

10
00:03:28,017 --> 00:03:29,037
Revenge?

11
00:03:29,038 --> 00:03:30,762
She needs to just move on.

12
00:03:30,763 --> 00:03:32,147
That's why we're here.

13
00:03:32,148 --> 00:03:33,330
You would suggest move on.

14
00:03:33,331 --> 00:03:34,399
You're usually the other woman.

15
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,233
Oh, shut up.

16
00:03:35,234 --> 00:03:36,605
Just 'cause I'm prettier than you

17
00:03:36,606 --> 00:03:38,483
and men are more interested in me than you

18
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,542
does not mean you have to be jealous.

19
00:03:40,543 --> 00:03:41,376
Jealous?

20
00:03:41,377 --> 00:03:42,538
I'm not calling you the pretty one.

21
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:43,548
I'm calling you the slut.

22
00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:45,006
And what are you?

23
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:46,302
Can you two stop?

24
00:03:46,303 --> 00:03:48,677
We're here for Kelly.

25
00:03:48,678 --> 00:03:50,200
Alice is right, I'm done.

26
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:51,665
Now you side with Alice?

27
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,431
Where were you when her
boyfriend was cheating on her?

28
00:03:53,432 --> 00:03:54,265
Oh, that's right.

29
00:03:54,265 --> 00:03:55,098
Under him.

30
00:03:55,098 --> 00:03:56,045
Pam!

31
00:03:56,045 --> 00:03:56,958
Enough!

32
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,006
Didn't you guys say
that tonight was about me

33
00:03:59,007 --> 00:04:01,085
and getting over Rick?

34
00:04:01,086 --> 00:04:02,190
And having a little fun?

35
00:04:02,191 --> 00:04:04,441
So let's have a little fun.

36
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:07,129
All right, sorry.

37
00:04:08,053 --> 00:04:08,886
Me, too.

38
00:04:09,934 --> 00:04:11,184
Sorry, Alice.

39
00:04:12,224 --> 00:04:14,306
We're all sorry.

40
00:04:14,307 --> 00:04:15,140
Now what?

41
00:04:17,028 --> 00:04:19,516
Now we get wasted.

42
00:04:19,517 --> 00:04:20,350
Woo!

43
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,433
I'll go make us drinks.

44
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:33,046
(liquor splashing)

45
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:49,747
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

46
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:52,998
To Kelly. (laughing)

47
00:04:54,283 --> 00:04:57,076
Mmm, we should play Never Have I Ever.

48
00:04:57,077 --> 00:04:59,611
Oh, that's a stupid game.

49
00:04:59,612 --> 00:05:02,334
Besides, we pretty much know
everything about each other.

50
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,781
And you'd be drinking and
just about everything said.

51
00:05:04,782 --> 00:05:05,980
(laughing)

52
00:05:05,981 --> 00:05:07,606
Yeah.

53
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:10,030
Know what we should do?

54
00:05:10,031 --> 00:05:11,614
Tell scary stories.

55
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,480
As long as Pam isn't telling any.

56
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,745
What's wrong with me
telling scary stories?

57
00:05:16,746 --> 00:05:19,218
The scary stories you
tell are probably real.

58
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:20,052
Oh, what's the matter?

59
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:22,109
Afraid of hearing about
a bloody crack whore

60
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,133
in a dark alley?

61
00:05:23,134 --> 00:05:25,799
I doubt there are too
many bloody crack whores

62
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,158
in dark alleys while Pam
is on traffic patrol.

63
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:31,794
Is it pick on Pam day?

64
00:05:31,795 --> 00:05:33,874
How often do you get
to make fun of a cop?

65
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,817
Excuse me that my job
means I get to carry a gun

66
00:05:35,818 --> 00:05:37,044
and have power.

67
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,673
Oh, carry a gun and have power?

68
00:05:38,674 --> 00:05:40,955
More like a flashlight and a ticket book.

69
00:05:40,956 --> 00:05:42,588
At least I have a job.

70
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:43,593
Well, don't look at me.

71
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:44,447
I have a job.

72
00:05:44,448 --> 00:05:46,499
Havin' a sugar daddy
doesn't count as a job.

73
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,903
Oh, bite me.

74
00:05:47,904 --> 00:05:49,415
I was referring to Isabel.

75
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,249
Me?

76
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:51,082
Mmm-hmm.

77
00:05:51,082 --> 00:05:52,082
How long did you last at that restaurant?

78
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,868
It interfered with my class schedule.

79
00:05:53,869 --> 00:05:55,095
You can't make fun of her for getting

80
00:05:55,096 --> 00:05:57,182
her graduate degree.

81
00:05:57,183 --> 00:05:58,350
Yes, we can.

82
00:05:59,703 --> 00:06:03,228
Okay, I'm going to
tell a really scary story

83
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:05,248
about my former neighbor.

84
00:06:05,249 --> 00:06:06,953
The neighbor that used to peek through

85
00:06:06,954 --> 00:06:08,486
your window while you
were getting dressed?

86
00:06:08,487 --> 00:06:10,131
No.

87
00:06:10,132 --> 00:06:12,549
This is about old Mr. Morton.

88
00:06:13,876 --> 00:06:16,418
Mr. Morton was a mechanic
and everyone thought

89
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:18,510
he was very nice.

90
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:22,011
Little did they know he had a dark secret.

91
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,692
[Rose] Excuse me, Mr. Morton?

92
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:34,323
Oh, hi Rose.

93
00:06:34,324 --> 00:06:35,212
How are you today?

94
00:06:35,212 --> 00:06:36,144
I'm good.

95
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,608
So my car is making a weird noise.

96
00:06:38,609 --> 00:06:40,758
Do you think you could take a look at it?

97
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:41,899
Sure, sure.

98
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,371
I'll make certain you don't
hear that noise anymore.

99
00:06:44,372 --> 00:06:45,372
Thank you.

100
00:06:58,164 --> 00:06:59,626
Hey, Maury.

101
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:00,705
It's Morton.

102
00:07:00,706 --> 00:07:01,749
Yeah, whatever.

103
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,840
I got this package here for
you from this next vendor.

104
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:05,757
It was delivered to my
store instead of here.

105
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,447
You really need to make sure you put

106
00:07:07,448 --> 00:07:08,880
the right address on your deliveries.

107
00:07:08,881 --> 00:07:11,443
Could you bring 'em to
my back office for me?

108
00:07:11,444 --> 00:07:12,372
Wouldn't you rather it here?

109
00:07:12,372 --> 00:07:13,247
It's the snack foods.

110
00:07:13,248 --> 00:07:14,601
I keep my storage in the back until

111
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:16,353
I'm ready to put it on the shelves.

112
00:07:16,354 --> 00:07:17,937
Look, can't I just leave it with you

113
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,054
or leave it here?

114
00:07:19,055 --> 00:07:20,926
If it's no great trouble,

115
00:07:20,927 --> 00:07:23,447
bring it to my back office
would be of great help.

116
00:07:23,448 --> 00:07:24,281
All right, fine.

117
00:07:24,281 --> 00:07:25,114
Whatever.

118
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:30,796
Stupid, annoying, pain
in the freakin' a...

119
00:07:31,854 --> 00:07:35,075
(dramatic music)

120
00:07:35,076 --> 00:07:37,409
(screaming)

121
00:07:58,136 --> 00:07:59,682
Hello, Mother.

122
00:07:59,683 --> 00:08:02,433
Francis, what are you drinking?

123
00:08:03,628 --> 00:08:04,461
Nothing.

124
00:08:06,248 --> 00:08:07,931
I've told you you need to limit

125
00:08:07,932 --> 00:08:09,986
your sugar intake.

126
00:08:09,987 --> 00:08:11,771
Does that juice contain sugar?

127
00:08:11,772 --> 00:08:13,492
No, Mother.

128
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,481
How do you know?

129
00:08:15,482 --> 00:08:19,190
Did you read the ingredients thoroughly?

130
00:08:19,191 --> 00:08:20,921
Um, no, Mother.

131
00:08:20,922 --> 00:08:22,839
Then how do you know?

132
00:08:24,111 --> 00:08:25,944
Where's the container?

133
00:08:27,193 --> 00:08:30,026
It's in the back office, Mother.

134
00:08:31,451 --> 00:08:33,618
(sighing)

135
00:08:44,406 --> 00:08:47,261
Did you clean that off yet?

136
00:08:47,262 --> 00:08:50,334
You always were such a bad child.

137
00:08:50,335 --> 00:08:52,766
Never cleaning up after yourself.

138
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:54,011
Yes, Mother.

139
00:08:54,012 --> 00:08:55,002
I did clean it.

140
00:08:55,003 --> 00:08:57,564
That's why there's no blood on it.

141
00:08:57,565 --> 00:09:00,211
Are you talking back to me?

142
00:09:00,212 --> 00:09:02,962
(dramatic music)

143
00:09:04,052 --> 00:09:05,834
If you use that fresh tongue with me,

144
00:09:05,835 --> 00:09:08,369
I will remove it from your mouth.

145
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,998
I brought you into this world

146
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:12,267
and it is my right to take you out of it

147
00:09:12,268 --> 00:09:14,351
if you get smart with me!

148
00:09:15,196 --> 00:09:17,189
Yes, Mother.

149
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,107
I am sorry.

150
00:09:24,286 --> 00:09:26,536
Ugh, this is very sugary.

151
00:09:27,717 --> 00:09:30,384
That man ate way too much candy.

152
00:09:32,099 --> 00:09:33,752
I guess his mother didn't tell him

153
00:09:33,753 --> 00:09:36,670
that too much candy could kill him.

154
00:09:59,718 --> 00:10:02,385
(hood thudding)

155
00:10:03,324 --> 00:10:07,324
There's little more
satisfying than what I do.

156
00:10:24,834 --> 00:10:26,917
(crying)

157
00:10:27,978 --> 00:10:30,389
I'm so glad you come to dinner.

158
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,912
I hate eating alone.

159
00:10:31,913 --> 00:10:33,284
(crying)

160
00:10:33,285 --> 00:10:35,596
I'm gonna take your gag off.

161
00:10:35,597 --> 00:10:38,765
But you must promise me that
you're not gonna scream.

162
00:10:38,766 --> 00:10:40,481
Can you do that?

163
00:10:40,482 --> 00:10:41,315
Mmm.

164
00:10:42,772 --> 00:10:45,398
'Cause if you scream,

165
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:48,816
well, let's, let's hope you don't scream.

166
00:10:50,478 --> 00:10:52,479
Please, Mr. Morton, just let me go.

167
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,149
I won't tell anyone, I swear.

168
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,370
I know you won't, Sierra.

169
00:10:56,371 --> 00:10:58,454
What would you tell them?

170
00:10:59,616 --> 00:11:00,449
Nothing.

171
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,688
I couldn't tell them anything.

172
00:11:01,689 --> 00:11:04,356
I just invited you for dinner.

173
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,102
You are the dinner.

174
00:11:11,101 --> 00:11:13,184
(crying)

175
00:11:15,353 --> 00:11:19,520
(screaming)
(knife thudding)

176
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:29,399
Francis, it looks like you
made another good meal here.

177
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,400
Oh, thank you, Mother.

178
00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:37,746
You thought my stories would be sick.

179
00:11:37,747 --> 00:11:40,179
Yeah, but, it can't
be real though, right?

180
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:43,951
I mean, it's not actually real, right?

181
00:11:43,952 --> 00:11:44,869
Is it real?

182
00:11:45,808 --> 00:11:47,512
- [Pam] He's right behind you!
- Oh!

183
00:11:47,513 --> 00:11:48,679
(laughing)

184
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,906
That's not funny!

185
00:11:49,907 --> 00:11:51,826
(laughing)

186
00:11:51,827 --> 00:11:53,083
It's not real though, right?

187
00:11:53,084 --> 00:11:54,539
Are you scared?

188
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,713
Relax, it's just a story.

189
00:11:56,714 --> 00:11:58,788
Well, I know it is, but
I've been to Alice's house.

190
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:00,660
If her neighbor is some
sort of twisted psycho,

191
00:12:00,661 --> 00:12:02,198
I want to know about it.

192
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:03,032
(laughing)

193
00:12:03,033 --> 00:12:04,247
Is it real?

194
00:12:04,248 --> 00:12:07,268
Oh my God, no, you scaredy cat.

195
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:08,991
It isn't real.

196
00:12:08,992 --> 00:12:11,194
(laughing)

197
00:12:11,195 --> 00:12:13,595
Mr. Morton is the name of
my first grade teacher.

198
00:12:13,596 --> 00:12:16,937
I think if my neighbor
were a serial killer,

199
00:12:16,938 --> 00:12:18,910
it'd be in the newspapers or something.

200
00:12:18,911 --> 00:12:20,780
And you know how to
read, right, Veronika?

201
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,305
Ha ha, laugh it up.

202
00:12:22,306 --> 00:12:23,656
We'll see how funny it
is when you're having

203
00:12:23,657 --> 00:12:25,013
nightmares about Mr. Morton cutting your

204
00:12:25,014 --> 00:12:26,826
body up into soup.

205
00:12:26,827 --> 00:12:28,339
All right.

206
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:32,507
That story wasn't anything
compared to the one I have.

207
00:12:35,138 --> 00:12:39,720
This is a story about
a group of five friends

208
00:12:39,721 --> 00:12:40,804
just like us.

209
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:45,432
As much fun as that story sounds,

210
00:12:45,433 --> 00:12:46,740
I don't think I could stomach anymore

211
00:12:46,741 --> 00:12:47,854
scary stories right now.

212
00:12:47,855 --> 00:12:49,175
Sure you can.

213
00:12:49,176 --> 00:12:50,432
Just stick your finger down your throat

214
00:12:50,433 --> 00:12:51,971
and throw them up like you do your dinner.

215
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:54,106
Are you calling me bulimic?

216
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,106
Really? Seriously?

217
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,614
How is that even funny?

218
00:12:56,615 --> 00:12:57,623
Right, I'm kidding.

219
00:12:57,624 --> 00:12:59,449
You're not thin enough to be bulimic.

220
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:02,518
Well, if you wanna continue
to tell scary stories,

221
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:05,409
I'm gonna go downstairs and watch TV.

222
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,852
Kelly, do you wanna come?

223
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:08,892
Oh, Veronika wants to give
you the lesbian experience.

224
00:13:08,893 --> 00:13:10,474
So says the dyke.

225
00:13:10,475 --> 00:13:11,661
Just because you haven't slept with any

226
00:13:11,662 --> 00:13:12,888
of my boyfriends yet.

227
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:15,262
If you want to go and
watch television, then go.

228
00:13:15,263 --> 00:13:16,485
I want to hear Isabel's story

229
00:13:16,486 --> 00:13:19,483
that's supposed to be scarier than mine.

230
00:13:19,484 --> 00:13:20,317
Kelly?

231
00:13:21,941 --> 00:13:24,513
I want to hear the scary story.

232
00:13:24,514 --> 00:13:25,895
Fine, whatever, have fun.

233
00:13:25,896 --> 00:13:29,094
Just let me know when cool time is over.

234
00:13:29,095 --> 00:13:30,095
And yours.

235
00:13:32,088 --> 00:13:33,742
I don't know why you guys
are friends with her.

236
00:13:33,743 --> 00:13:35,371
Oh, please, you're
friends with her, too.

237
00:13:35,372 --> 00:13:36,572
No, I just hang out with her because

238
00:13:36,573 --> 00:13:37,676
the rest of you do.

239
00:13:37,677 --> 00:13:38,657
I can't stand her.

240
00:13:38,658 --> 00:13:40,806
Then why are there
sometimes when just the two

241
00:13:40,807 --> 00:13:42,103
of you hang out together?

242
00:13:42,104 --> 00:13:42,937
Like when?

243
00:13:42,938 --> 00:13:44,686
Ah, two weeks ago when the two of you

244
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:46,858
went to the bar and she
almost slept with the busboy?

245
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,500
I had no one else to hang out with.

246
00:13:48,501 --> 00:13:50,528
You are just as much friends with her

247
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,648
as everyone else in the room is.

248
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:54,503
I just hang out with her out of habit.

249
00:13:54,504 --> 00:13:56,802
I mean, that's about it.

250
00:13:56,803 --> 00:14:00,404
You are so full of shit right now.

251
00:14:00,405 --> 00:14:02,157
Yeah, probably.

252
00:14:02,158 --> 00:14:03,059
Come on, Isabel.

253
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,460
I want to hear your scary story.

254
00:14:04,461 --> 00:14:06,211
I want to see if you can top mine.

255
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:07,795
Okay, you got it.

256
00:14:10,654 --> 00:14:13,259
So there were a group of five friends

257
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,927
hiking in the woods.

258
00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:27,154
I can't believe you made
us go hiking in the snow

259
00:14:27,155 --> 00:14:30,155
and the rain just to see this thing.

260
00:14:31,868 --> 00:14:33,563
How much longer until we get there?

261
00:14:33,564 --> 00:14:35,984
You really love to complain, don't you?

262
00:14:35,985 --> 00:14:38,084
I mean, just enjoy the hike.

263
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,607
Enjoy being in the woods.

264
00:14:39,608 --> 00:14:41,503
It's way better than being in the city.

265
00:14:41,504 --> 00:14:43,195
I wish I were in my bed.

266
00:14:43,196 --> 00:14:45,127
God, I'm exhausted.

267
00:14:45,128 --> 00:14:47,357
I'd enjoy being in
your bed right now, too.

268
00:14:47,358 --> 00:14:48,775
Whatever, perv.

269
00:14:51,032 --> 00:14:53,661
Get your grubby claws off of me.

270
00:14:53,662 --> 00:14:54,787
You said there was a ridge?

271
00:14:54,788 --> 00:14:55,980
Yeah.

272
00:14:55,981 --> 00:14:57,875
I don't see a ridge.

273
00:14:57,876 --> 00:15:01,118
About 10 or so more hours that way.

274
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,546
Did you just say 10 hours?

275
00:15:02,547 --> 00:15:03,962
Oh, grow a pair.

276
00:15:03,963 --> 00:15:04,796
10 hours?

277
00:15:04,797 --> 00:15:06,676
I'm not walking 10 hours.

278
00:15:06,677 --> 00:15:07,866
I'm just kidding.

279
00:15:07,867 --> 00:15:10,867
I don't actually know how far it is.

280
00:15:11,768 --> 00:15:13,851
Hey, watch it, you bum.

281
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,374
Leave him alone.

282
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,291
He's probably homeless.

283
00:15:21,936 --> 00:15:23,363
Come on, guys.

284
00:15:23,364 --> 00:15:25,933
It's just some smelly homeless loser.

285
00:15:25,934 --> 00:15:30,101
Probably doesn't realize
he's back from the war yet.

286
00:15:32,091 --> 00:15:35,174
(soft ominous music)

287
00:15:42,471 --> 00:15:45,221
(steps creaking)

288
00:15:52,455 --> 00:15:54,162
Oh!
(dramatic music)

289
00:15:54,163 --> 00:15:56,715
Oh, I don't know about you guys,

290
00:15:56,716 --> 00:15:58,830
but I have to take a piss.

291
00:15:58,831 --> 00:16:00,015
Thanks for the narrative.

292
00:16:00,016 --> 00:16:01,495
That's really attractive.

293
00:16:01,496 --> 00:16:03,532
You're more than welcome
to come hold it for me.

294
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:04,949
Hey, Lucy.

295
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:08,022
Did you bring tweezers
to hold it for Pete?

296
00:16:08,023 --> 00:16:08,856
Oh, ha ha.

297
00:16:08,856 --> 00:16:09,775
Make your jokes, Janine.

298
00:16:09,776 --> 00:16:11,662
That's why you're always single.

299
00:16:11,663 --> 00:16:13,780
I'm gonna have to use the bathroom also.

300
00:16:13,781 --> 00:16:15,279
It's called a piss.

301
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,113
We're in the woods.

302
00:16:16,114 --> 00:16:17,392
There are no bathrooms.

303
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,378
Yes, there are.

304
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:20,574
Any tree I squat behind is the bathroom.

305
00:16:20,575 --> 00:16:22,399
Come on, let's go with her.

306
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,918
Make sure this guy doesn't
try to peep a show.

307
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:30,134
Oh yeah, 'cause I'm known
for watching girls pee, right?

308
00:16:30,135 --> 00:16:32,465
I don't know what floats your boat.

309
00:16:32,466 --> 00:16:34,312
Well, you caught me.

310
00:16:34,313 --> 00:16:35,921
That's my fetish.

311
00:16:35,922 --> 00:16:38,258
Women peeing on feet.

312
00:16:38,259 --> 00:16:41,190
I'm startin' to think that
this foot fetish is real.

313
00:16:41,191 --> 00:16:43,514
No one said anything about feet.

314
00:16:43,515 --> 00:16:44,447
Come on, let's go.

315
00:16:44,447 --> 00:16:45,447
I gotta pee.

316
00:16:52,351 --> 00:16:56,518
(whimpering and crying)
(ominous music)

317
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:31,925
Oh.

318
00:17:34,741 --> 00:17:35,574
Oh.

319
00:17:37,238 --> 00:17:38,071
Oh.

320
00:17:39,156 --> 00:17:39,989
(dramatic music)

321
00:17:39,989 --> 00:17:40,822
What the?

322
00:17:40,823 --> 00:17:43,072
(grunting)

323
00:17:51,908 --> 00:17:54,408
That looks like a good spot.

324
00:18:05,914 --> 00:18:08,664
(dramatic music)

325
00:18:16,021 --> 00:18:18,354
(screaming)

326
00:18:19,495 --> 00:18:20,328
No! No!

327
00:18:22,257 --> 00:18:26,424
(whimpering and crying)
(ominous music)

328
00:19:20,175 --> 00:19:22,508
(screaming)

329
00:19:24,878 --> 00:19:27,338
What happened to Tom?

330
00:19:27,339 --> 00:19:29,922
Has he been mauled by a bear?

331
00:19:33,366 --> 00:19:36,033
(ominous music)

332
00:19:37,917 --> 00:19:38,917
Lucy, don't.

333
00:19:43,597 --> 00:19:44,597
Oh my God.

334
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:52,809
(dramatic music)

335
00:19:54,021 --> 00:19:55,590
Go!

336
00:19:55,591 --> 00:19:58,341
(dramatic music)

337
00:19:59,605 --> 00:20:02,938
(whimpering and crying)

338
00:20:16,102 --> 00:20:19,102
(breathing heavily)

339
00:20:23,408 --> 00:20:24,925
Tom's dead.

340
00:20:24,926 --> 00:20:26,593
That guy killed him.

341
00:20:29,018 --> 00:20:29,925
Tom's dead!

342
00:20:29,926 --> 00:20:31,639
What are we gonna do?

343
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,394
Pete's probably dead too, right?

344
00:20:33,395 --> 00:20:34,522
No, don't say that.

345
00:20:34,523 --> 00:20:36,069
I'm sure he's fine.

346
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,653
I'm sure he's fine.

347
00:20:38,735 --> 00:20:39,818
Tom's dead.

348
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,949
Pete's probably dead.

349
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,307
Shut up, Mary, please!

350
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:44,779
I'm sure he's fine.

351
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:48,834
He probably saw the drifter
attack Tom and then ran.

352
00:20:48,835 --> 00:20:50,963
I'm sure he's fine.

353
00:20:50,964 --> 00:20:53,617
He's probably looking for us right now.

354
00:20:53,618 --> 00:20:57,109
No, he's probably dead right now.

355
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,523
[Janine] Don't say that!

356
00:20:58,524 --> 00:20:59,357
(screaming)

357
00:20:59,357 --> 00:21:00,190
Run!

358
00:21:00,191 --> 00:21:03,018
(screaming)

359
00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:06,352
(whimpering and crying)

360
00:21:21,727 --> 00:21:24,644
Holy shit, this can't be happening.

361
00:21:28,109 --> 00:21:30,192
Janine, keep it together.

362
00:21:31,244 --> 00:21:33,288
We gotta figure out what we're gonna do.

363
00:21:33,289 --> 00:21:34,796
We're gonna die.

364
00:21:34,797 --> 00:21:37,086
We gotta get out of here.

365
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,587
We gotta get help.

366
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,130
First Tom, Pete.

367
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:51,102
Then Lucy.

368
00:21:55,459 --> 00:21:56,978
We're next.

369
00:21:56,979 --> 00:21:58,790
We're not next.

370
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,872
We need to get out of these woods.

371
00:22:00,873 --> 00:22:01,706
Let's go.

372
00:22:11,528 --> 00:22:14,310
If you don't get up and
go with me right now,

373
00:22:14,311 --> 00:22:16,228
I'm going to leave you.

374
00:22:18,066 --> 00:22:19,296
Do you hear me?

375
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:21,380
I'm gonna leave you here!

376
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:26,449
Fine.

377
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,867
That's your call.

378
00:22:32,825 --> 00:22:35,492
(crying softly)

379
00:22:44,719 --> 00:22:47,469
(snow crunching)

380
00:23:01,951 --> 00:23:05,451
(eerie suspenseful music)

381
00:24:06,326 --> 00:24:08,993
(ominous music)

382
00:24:35,743 --> 00:24:38,743
(breathing heavily)

383
00:24:47,273 --> 00:24:49,523
(grunting)

384
00:25:09,377 --> 00:25:12,044
(ominous music)

385
00:25:32,171 --> 00:25:33,004
Come on, Mary.

386
00:25:33,005 --> 00:25:34,548
Get up.

387
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:36,167
You can do it.

388
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:37,168
Just get up.

389
00:25:46,515 --> 00:25:48,765
(grunting)

390
00:25:52,006 --> 00:25:54,673
(ominous music)

391
00:26:02,032 --> 00:26:04,115
(crying)

392
00:26:13,432 --> 00:26:16,182
(dramatic music)

393
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:22,810
(screaming)
(dramatic music)

394
00:26:47,637 --> 00:26:49,304
Okay, start walking.

395
00:26:50,293 --> 00:26:51,876
Just start walking.

396
00:26:52,916 --> 00:26:55,091
You need to get help.

397
00:26:55,092 --> 00:26:56,675
Just start walking.

398
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,193
Ah.

399
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:07,292
(whimpering)

400
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:19,551
(ominous music)
(coughing)

401
00:27:27,378 --> 00:27:30,128
(snow crunching)

402
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:47,427
(screaming)
(dramatic music)

403
00:27:48,346 --> 00:27:49,918
That wasn't scary.

404
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,284
It scared me.

405
00:27:51,285 --> 00:27:52,118
Don't worry.

406
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:54,439
Pam has her gun to protect us.

407
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,504
Do you actually have your gun with you?

408
00:27:56,505 --> 00:27:58,280
Yeah, I've got it hidden in my bra.

409
00:27:58,281 --> 00:27:59,307
Wanna see?

410
00:27:59,308 --> 00:28:01,507
Are you trying to show
us your gun or your boobs?

411
00:28:01,508 --> 00:28:04,218
Ah, okay, enough with show and tell.

412
00:28:04,219 --> 00:28:06,802
Pam, do you have a scary story?

413
00:28:08,216 --> 00:28:09,826
Nah, you can go.

414
00:28:09,827 --> 00:28:13,132
I'm still trying to
think of one, so you go.

415
00:28:13,133 --> 00:28:15,320
I bet this isn't gonna be scary.

416
00:28:15,321 --> 00:28:17,097
I'll bet you 20 bucks
my story is so scary,

417
00:28:17,098 --> 00:28:18,725
you'll wet yourself.

418
00:28:18,726 --> 00:28:19,726
You're on.

419
00:28:26,092 --> 00:28:29,354
So it was a quiet, rainy night

420
00:28:29,355 --> 00:28:32,966
and a group of girls were
telling scary stories

421
00:28:32,967 --> 00:28:36,662
when all of a sudden toxic water shot out.

422
00:28:36,663 --> 00:28:38,892
(gasping)

423
00:28:38,893 --> 00:28:40,251
What the hell?

424
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:42,238
I smell like alcohol now!

425
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:43,072
Uh!

426
00:28:44,372 --> 00:28:46,496
I'm going to the bathroom and clean off.

427
00:28:46,497 --> 00:28:49,001
There are towels up in the
cabinet if you need them.

428
00:28:49,002 --> 00:28:49,835
Thanks.

429
00:28:59,502 --> 00:29:02,289
That wasn't even funny!

430
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:04,540
(laughing)

431
00:29:08,054 --> 00:29:09,829
Do you have a story that doesn't include

432
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,388
throwing anything on anyone?

433
00:29:11,389 --> 00:29:12,563
Or should I go?

434
00:29:12,564 --> 00:29:13,903
Kelly, maybe you should go.

435
00:29:13,904 --> 00:29:15,916
I don't want anything thrown on me.

436
00:29:15,917 --> 00:29:17,104
Good one. (laughing)

437
00:29:17,105 --> 00:29:20,649
All right, not too long ago in a place

438
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:23,044
you both may have been,

439
00:29:23,045 --> 00:29:26,152
there was a seemingly happy couple.

440
00:29:26,153 --> 00:29:28,927
Hey, Rick, we should go out tonight.

441
00:29:28,928 --> 00:29:30,192
Oh yeah, sweetheart?

442
00:29:30,193 --> 00:29:31,385
Where do you wanna go?

443
00:29:31,386 --> 00:29:33,980
I was thinking we could go
to that new Thai restaurant

444
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:36,898
or that lounge that just opened up.

445
00:29:37,986 --> 00:29:41,647
So you either want to go
to an expensive restaurant

446
00:29:41,648 --> 00:29:43,088
so you can make me feel broke

447
00:29:43,089 --> 00:29:44,481
and that I can't afford the prices,

448
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:47,250
or go to a bar so you can get
hit on by a bunch of guys?

449
00:29:47,251 --> 00:29:48,084
Oh, come on.

450
00:29:48,085 --> 00:29:49,486
No one's gonna hit on me if I'm with you.

451
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:52,518
I just, I thought it would be
nice to go out for a change.

452
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:55,406
Oh, so staying in with
me isn't good enough

453
00:29:55,407 --> 00:29:56,294
for you now?

454
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:57,829
Am I not good enough for you?

455
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:58,741
I wasn't saying that.

456
00:29:58,741 --> 00:29:59,574
No, no, no, no.

457
00:29:59,575 --> 00:30:00,790
What you were saying
is that you'd rather go

458
00:30:00,791 --> 00:30:02,905
to a bar and get hit
on by a bunch of guys.

459
00:30:02,906 --> 00:30:04,586
Are you trying to replace me, is that it?

460
00:30:04,587 --> 00:30:06,135
No, that's crazy!

461
00:30:06,136 --> 00:30:07,800
So now I'm crazy!

462
00:30:07,801 --> 00:30:09,010
I can't take this shit with you.

463
00:30:09,011 --> 00:30:09,844
I'm goin' home, all right?

464
00:30:09,845 --> 00:30:11,084
Rick, please stay.

465
00:30:11,085 --> 00:30:12,188
Now you want me.

466
00:30:12,189 --> 00:30:13,022
Too late.

467
00:30:13,023 --> 00:30:14,272
I'm goin' home.

468
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,283
Oh, that fucking bitch spilled her drink

469
00:30:29,284 --> 00:30:30,784
all over my shirt.

470
00:30:37,088 --> 00:30:37,921
Hey, uh.

471
00:30:39,317 --> 00:30:42,860
You're not holding my hand
the way you normally do.

472
00:30:42,861 --> 00:30:43,798
I'm sorry.

473
00:30:43,798 --> 00:30:44,631
I didn't realize.

474
00:30:44,632 --> 00:30:46,964
Do you want me to adjust it?

475
00:30:48,476 --> 00:30:50,347
Were you holding another guy's hand?

476
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,739
Is that why you're holding
my hand all differently?

477
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,880
What are you talkin' about?

478
00:30:52,881 --> 00:30:56,851
No, I wasn't holding another guy's hand.

479
00:30:56,852 --> 00:30:59,213
So you were holdin'
something else on another guy.

480
00:30:59,214 --> 00:31:01,816
Baby, I would never do that.

481
00:31:01,817 --> 00:31:04,333
Yeah, I believe that.

482
00:31:04,334 --> 00:31:05,413
Rick, I love you.

483
00:31:05,414 --> 00:31:07,633
I would never cheat on you.

484
00:31:07,634 --> 00:31:08,870
You better not.

485
00:31:08,871 --> 00:31:12,097
Because if you ever did,
I'd kill the both of you.

486
00:31:12,098 --> 00:31:13,431
And then myself.

487
00:31:18,986 --> 00:31:21,154
(screaming)

488
00:31:21,155 --> 00:31:22,861
How can you say you don't
want to be with me anymore?

489
00:31:22,862 --> 00:31:23,897
Look, I love you.

490
00:31:23,898 --> 00:31:26,631
I just, this isn't the first
time you cheated on me.

491
00:31:26,632 --> 00:31:28,052
I can't do this anymore.

492
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:30,053
I said I was sorry.

493
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:33,352
Don't you love me enough to forgive me?

494
00:31:33,353 --> 00:31:34,243
Come on, baby.

495
00:31:34,244 --> 00:31:35,442
Give me another chance.

496
00:31:35,443 --> 00:31:37,673
No, I've given you multiple chances.

497
00:31:37,674 --> 00:31:39,978
I'm done, that's it.

498
00:31:39,979 --> 00:31:41,045
You know what?

499
00:31:41,046 --> 00:31:42,392
You're gonna regret this.

500
00:31:42,393 --> 00:31:43,232
Trust me.

501
00:31:43,233 --> 00:31:44,946
You're gonna regret it.

502
00:31:44,947 --> 00:31:47,030
You're gonna regret this.

503
00:31:49,377 --> 00:31:52,294
(soft piano music)

504
00:32:07,491 --> 00:32:09,336
That wasn't a scary story.

505
00:32:09,337 --> 00:32:11,643
Well, it was a little scary,

506
00:32:11,644 --> 00:32:14,199
but not the type of scary we meant.

507
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,535
True stories are
usually the scariest ones.

508
00:32:17,536 --> 00:32:19,570
We'll finish it for you.

509
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:21,865
The crazy boyfriend snuck into the house

510
00:32:21,866 --> 00:32:24,115
where the girl and her friends were.

511
00:32:24,116 --> 00:32:24,949
And killed them all!

512
00:32:24,949 --> 00:32:25,782
(thumping)

513
00:32:25,782 --> 00:32:26,756
What was that?

514
00:32:26,757 --> 00:32:28,269
See, I told a scary story.

515
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:30,986
Yeah, not very funny ones, though.

516
00:32:30,987 --> 00:32:32,839
It's probably just Veronika watching TV.

517
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,920
We should go check on her.

518
00:32:33,921 --> 00:32:35,132
Why? She's fine.

519
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:37,628
I don't think it was Veronika I heard.

520
00:32:37,629 --> 00:32:38,779
Come on, let's just go downstairs

521
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,217
and see what she's doing.

522
00:32:40,218 --> 00:32:41,488
How about another story?

523
00:32:41,489 --> 00:32:43,184
I think I'm storied out for now.

524
00:32:43,185 --> 00:32:44,623
Yeah, me too.

525
00:32:44,624 --> 00:32:46,874
Let's go check on Veronika.

526
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:56,482
Veronika, where are you?

527
00:32:56,483 --> 00:32:58,526
Could she be watching
TV in a different room?

528
00:32:58,527 --> 00:32:59,617
Like in the bedroom with the high school

529
00:32:59,618 --> 00:33:01,061
boy who lives next door.

530
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,543
Unless she went upstairs,
I don't know where

531
00:33:02,544 --> 00:33:04,011
she could be watching TV.

532
00:33:04,012 --> 00:33:04,929
Veronika!

533
00:33:13,567 --> 00:33:16,437
Kelly, how are you holding up?

534
00:33:16,438 --> 00:33:18,105
I'm okay, I guess.

535
00:33:19,174 --> 00:33:20,123
We're here.

536
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,040
Talk to us.

537
00:33:22,877 --> 00:33:23,710
Ah.

538
00:33:24,846 --> 00:33:27,640
I know Rick wasn't perfect.

539
00:33:27,641 --> 00:33:30,892
Our relationship sure wasn't perfect.

540
00:33:30,893 --> 00:33:32,691
But he meant well.

541
00:33:32,692 --> 00:33:33,741
He loved me.

542
00:33:33,742 --> 00:33:36,779
He just couldn't keep it in his pants.

543
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,679
Well, yeah.

544
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,882
But he was there for me.

545
00:33:40,883 --> 00:33:42,953
He would do anything for me.

546
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:44,574
He didn't treat you well.

547
00:33:44,575 --> 00:33:45,408
Mmm-mmm.

548
00:33:45,408 --> 00:33:46,241
I know.

549
00:33:46,242 --> 00:33:47,342
He was an asshole.

550
00:33:47,343 --> 00:33:50,315
You told me some of the shit he did.

551
00:33:50,316 --> 00:33:54,311
I guess I was just so
used to having him around.

552
00:33:54,312 --> 00:33:57,062
It's kind of weird being broken up.

553
00:33:57,063 --> 00:34:00,361
I almost forget he isn't with me.

554
00:34:00,362 --> 00:34:02,461
You are better off without him.

555
00:34:02,462 --> 00:34:03,585
Unless you enjoy having a boyfriend

556
00:34:03,586 --> 00:34:05,710
who sleeps with everyone else.

557
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:06,554
No.

558
00:34:06,555 --> 00:34:09,384
See, you are better off without him.

559
00:34:09,385 --> 00:34:11,134
He was just so sweet sometimes,

560
00:34:11,135 --> 00:34:15,793
and then at other times he
was insanely possessive.

561
00:34:15,794 --> 00:34:18,018
He didn't even like me having friends.

562
00:34:18,019 --> 00:34:20,299
It was jealousy and fear.

563
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,366
He didn't want anyone to help you realize

564
00:34:21,367 --> 00:34:22,950
what a dick he was.

565
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:26,634
I think it was pretty
easy to figure that one out

566
00:34:26,635 --> 00:34:28,253
without anyone else's help.

567
00:34:28,254 --> 00:34:29,793
Yeah.

568
00:34:29,794 --> 00:34:30,872
I don't know how I
could get through this

569
00:34:30,873 --> 00:34:32,320
without you guys.

570
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:35,131
That's what we're here for.

571
00:34:35,132 --> 00:34:36,465
That, and to drink your liquor.

572
00:34:36,466 --> 00:34:37,999
Oh, well at least you're honest.

573
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,296
(laughing)

574
00:34:39,297 --> 00:34:40,619
You know I'm just messing with you.

575
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,453
Yeah, I know.

576
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:44,361
And besides, Alice brought the liquor.

577
00:34:44,362 --> 00:34:46,375
She should've kept it
away from Pam, though.

578
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:47,722
Ha ha.

579
00:34:47,723 --> 00:34:50,503
Actually since you don't
have a drink in your hand

580
00:34:50,504 --> 00:34:52,607
to throw at us, I am
kind of curious to hear

581
00:34:52,608 --> 00:34:55,231
that scary story you had in mind.

582
00:34:55,232 --> 00:34:56,065
Okay.

583
00:34:59,739 --> 00:35:03,266
It's a story about two
co-workers on a first date.

584
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,624
Roland had finally worked up the nerve

585
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:06,757
to ask out Charlie, who
he'd been obsessing over

586
00:35:06,758 --> 00:35:08,425
for quite some time.

587
00:35:09,447 --> 00:35:12,364
(soft piano music)

588
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,010
(knocking)

589
00:35:44,952 --> 00:35:46,084
Hi.

590
00:35:46,085 --> 00:35:47,935
I'm glad you could make it.

591
00:35:47,936 --> 00:35:48,769
Me, too.

592
00:35:48,769 --> 00:35:49,602
Come in.

593
00:35:59,497 --> 00:36:00,858
Thank you.

594
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:01,888
Sure.

595
00:36:01,889 --> 00:36:03,377
Have a seat.

596
00:36:03,378 --> 00:36:05,207
I'm just gonna throw this inside.

597
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:08,541
All right. (chuckles)

598
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:28,243
(whimpering and screaming)

599
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:42,583
Shh.

600
00:36:43,418 --> 00:36:44,251
Shut up!

601
00:36:45,288 --> 00:36:46,455
I got company!

602
00:36:48,607 --> 00:36:49,440
Shh!

603
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:53,916
Shh.

604
00:37:13,942 --> 00:37:15,199
Everything all right?

605
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,723
Oh, are you expecting someone?

606
00:37:16,724 --> 00:37:17,802
Yes.

607
00:37:17,803 --> 00:37:19,351
You.

608
00:37:19,352 --> 00:37:20,185
Wine?

609
00:37:21,456 --> 00:37:22,706
No thank you.

610
00:37:28,118 --> 00:37:30,088
You are a beautiful woman.

611
00:37:30,089 --> 00:37:31,256
You know that?

612
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,276
Everyday I pass by your cubicle

613
00:37:34,277 --> 00:37:35,944
three or four times.

614
00:37:37,776 --> 00:37:39,623
The attention hasn't gone unnoticed.

615
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:40,457
Good.

616
00:37:41,536 --> 00:37:45,664
So you wanted to talk
to me about something?

617
00:37:45,665 --> 00:37:46,832
My daughter.

618
00:37:48,904 --> 00:37:51,237
Um, I'm so sorry, I heard.

619
00:37:52,709 --> 00:37:55,584
Is there anything I can do?

620
00:37:55,585 --> 00:37:57,002
It depends.

621
00:37:57,003 --> 00:37:58,874
The last time that anybody saw her,

622
00:37:58,875 --> 00:38:02,106
she was near our office and I know that,

623
00:38:02,107 --> 00:38:04,552
I know that you usually work pretty late.

624
00:38:04,553 --> 00:38:07,043
So I was wondering if you
were there on Monday night

625
00:38:07,044 --> 00:38:08,583
and perhaps you might've seen her

626
00:38:08,584 --> 00:38:10,742
or you might've seen something suspicious.

627
00:38:10,743 --> 00:38:12,993
(thumping)

628
00:38:14,651 --> 00:38:15,651
Neighbors.

629
00:38:16,608 --> 00:38:18,525
Excuse me for a minute.

630
00:38:31,123 --> 00:38:34,540
(soft suspenseful music)

631
00:39:09,118 --> 00:39:11,868
(dramatic music)

632
00:39:12,768 --> 00:39:13,601
Help!

633
00:39:15,998 --> 00:39:16,831
Help!

634
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:18,843
Help!

635
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,335
Help!

636
00:39:21,336 --> 00:39:22,169
Help!

637
00:39:23,814 --> 00:39:25,147
Someone help me!

638
00:39:26,984 --> 00:39:31,151
(whimpering)
(ominous music)

639
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:39,821
(grunting)

640
00:39:39,822 --> 00:39:43,609
I asked you politely
to please keep it down.

641
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:46,952
(punch thumping)

642
00:39:46,953 --> 00:39:49,486
You're being extremely rude.

643
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:52,320
I'm tryin' to have a good evening!

644
00:40:00,372 --> 00:40:03,205
(paper crinkling)

645
00:40:27,325 --> 00:40:30,242
(soft piano music)

646
00:40:41,623 --> 00:40:43,346
You be a good girl

647
00:40:43,347 --> 00:40:46,855
and nothin's gonna happen to you.

648
00:40:46,856 --> 00:40:47,939
She loves me.

649
00:40:48,777 --> 00:40:50,381
We're gonna have a good time.

650
00:40:50,382 --> 00:40:51,465
Keep it down!

651
00:40:52,399 --> 00:40:54,065
Don't be rude!

652
00:40:54,066 --> 00:40:55,649
I hate rude people!

653
00:41:05,523 --> 00:41:07,190
So sorry about that.

654
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:10,210
Is everything okay?

655
00:41:10,211 --> 00:41:11,486
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

656
00:41:11,487 --> 00:41:13,223
You know how it is.

657
00:41:13,224 --> 00:41:15,956
They kick once, you
kick back twice as hard

658
00:41:15,957 --> 00:41:17,207
to shut 'em up.

659
00:41:21,287 --> 00:41:23,172
So what'd you ask me?

660
00:41:23,173 --> 00:41:25,437
My daughter is my heart and soul

661
00:41:25,438 --> 00:41:27,416
and since she's been missing it's like

662
00:41:27,417 --> 00:41:29,929
my heart and my soul
have been taken from me,

663
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:31,976
ripped from my body.

664
00:41:31,977 --> 00:41:33,529
It is an unbearable heartache

665
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:35,895
that no one should have to bear.

666
00:41:35,896 --> 00:41:38,488
And I would do absolutely anything

667
00:41:38,489 --> 00:41:40,094
to get her back safe.

668
00:41:40,095 --> 00:41:42,389
To have her in my arms one more time

669
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:45,856
to tell her that mommy loves you.

670
00:41:45,857 --> 00:41:47,692
I understand.

671
00:41:47,693 --> 00:41:50,108
I'll do anything to help you.

672
00:41:50,109 --> 00:41:51,240
Why?

673
00:41:51,241 --> 00:41:53,408
'Cause I care about you.

674
00:41:56,918 --> 00:41:57,918
What's this?

675
00:42:00,096 --> 00:42:01,013
A locket.

676
00:42:02,073 --> 00:42:03,369
Look at it.

677
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:04,797
I want you to see how much love

678
00:42:04,798 --> 00:42:06,715
I have for my daughter.

679
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:11,042
When she was 12, God, she was so excited.

680
00:42:12,792 --> 00:42:14,828
That was the first birthday
present she ever got me

681
00:42:14,829 --> 00:42:16,412
with her own money.

682
00:42:17,291 --> 00:42:19,005
And when I opened it up,

683
00:42:19,006 --> 00:42:23,006
the smile on her face,
it just, I almost melted.

684
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:27,562
It's beautiful, just like you.

685
00:42:29,256 --> 00:42:31,339
It's not just a locket.

686
00:42:33,357 --> 00:42:36,857
She always wanted us to be together, so...

687
00:42:38,457 --> 00:42:40,624
She bought a matching set.

688
00:42:41,805 --> 00:42:44,961
And she wore it all the time.

689
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:46,570
That's, Charlie.

690
00:42:46,571 --> 00:42:49,925
I don't know what you're thinking.

691
00:42:49,926 --> 00:42:50,759
Has it?

692
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,468
Whoa, but I can explain!

693
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:53,457
Stop! Don't!

694
00:42:53,458 --> 00:42:55,874
(gun firing)

695
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:04,036
I swore I would never let
anyone hurt my little girl.

696
00:43:07,193 --> 00:43:09,026
Baby, mommy loves you!

697
00:43:12,897 --> 00:43:14,855
Oh my God, oh my God.

698
00:43:14,856 --> 00:43:16,777
Oh my God, baby.

699
00:43:16,778 --> 00:43:17,695
Oh, Carrie.

700
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:20,175
Oh, baby.

701
00:43:20,176 --> 00:43:21,087
Mom.
(crying)

702
00:43:21,088 --> 00:43:23,646
[Charlie] It's okay.

703
00:43:23,647 --> 00:43:24,730
I got, right.

704
00:43:26,397 --> 00:43:27,757
(crying)

705
00:43:27,758 --> 00:43:28,600
It's okay.

706
00:43:28,601 --> 00:43:31,344
And then she untied her.

707
00:43:31,345 --> 00:43:33,678
Oh my God, that was crazy.

708
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:38,420
I knew your story
was gonna be some crazy

709
00:43:38,421 --> 00:43:40,204
story from the job.

710
00:43:40,205 --> 00:43:42,567
I'm gonna have nightmares about it.

711
00:43:42,568 --> 00:43:43,935
Is that a case you worked?

712
00:43:43,936 --> 00:43:46,539
No, it's just something
I saw on TV last week.

713
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,589
What?

714
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:49,314
You had me thinking that that whole thing

715
00:43:49,315 --> 00:43:50,828
actually happened.

716
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:52,459
No, I just said it was a story.

717
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:53,696
I never said it was true.

718
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:54,646
(laughing)

719
00:43:54,646 --> 00:43:55,524
Wow.

720
00:43:55,525 --> 00:43:57,310
Hey, it's your fault for not realizing

721
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:58,691
it's just a story.

722
00:43:58,692 --> 00:44:02,126
Okay, well you got me on that one.

723
00:44:02,127 --> 00:44:05,274
Anyone else have a scary story?

724
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:07,890
I have a story about a friend

725
00:44:07,891 --> 00:44:09,857
whose name I won't mention,

726
00:44:09,858 --> 00:44:11,691
and her 21st birthday.

727
00:44:12,532 --> 00:44:13,365
Okay, you're done.

728
00:44:13,365 --> 00:44:14,238
Isabel, you have one?

729
00:44:14,238 --> 00:44:15,071
No, no, no, no, no.

730
00:44:15,072 --> 00:44:16,675
I want to hear about this 21st birthday.

731
00:44:16,676 --> 00:44:18,127
Come on, please let me tell her.

732
00:44:18,128 --> 00:44:19,375
This is the problem with being friends

733
00:44:19,376 --> 00:44:20,297
with someone for too long.

734
00:44:20,298 --> 00:44:21,977
No, this is the problem
with drinking too much

735
00:44:21,978 --> 00:44:23,067
on your 21st birthday.

736
00:44:23,068 --> 00:44:24,146
I want to hear about this one already.

737
00:44:24,147 --> 00:44:25,522
No, it's too embarrassing!

738
00:44:25,523 --> 00:44:26,391
Oh, come on.

739
00:44:26,392 --> 00:44:27,506
Please?

740
00:44:27,507 --> 00:44:28,379
Tell her.

741
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:30,557
But all your embarrassing
stories are fair game then.

742
00:44:30,558 --> 00:44:31,733
Fine.

743
00:44:31,734 --> 00:44:32,682
Okay.

744
00:44:32,683 --> 00:44:36,844
So it's Pam's 21st
birthday and a bunch of us

745
00:44:36,845 --> 00:44:38,855
decide to go to a bar to celebrate.

746
00:44:38,856 --> 00:44:40,265
Okay.

747
00:44:40,266 --> 00:44:42,400
So it's Pam's 21st birthday and she has

748
00:44:42,401 --> 00:44:43,853
never drank before.

749
00:44:43,854 --> 00:44:44,687
Yes, I had.

750
00:44:44,688 --> 00:44:46,901
No, you didn't even know
what the drinks were called.

751
00:44:46,902 --> 00:44:48,222
Just because I didn't know
what the drinks were called

752
00:44:48,223 --> 00:44:49,458
doesn't mean I never drank before.

753
00:44:49,459 --> 00:44:50,292
Oh, okay.

754
00:44:50,293 --> 00:44:52,866
Regardless, so she's
ordering drink after drink

755
00:44:52,867 --> 00:44:54,726
just because she likes their names.

756
00:44:54,727 --> 00:44:57,289
She gets so drunk, I
don't even think she knew

757
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:59,632
what she was drinking. (laughing)

758
00:44:59,633 --> 00:45:01,156
I'm waiting to hear where this is going!

759
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:02,618
I'll cut to the chase.

760
00:45:02,619 --> 00:45:05,370
I had a Veronika moment at the bar.

761
00:45:05,371 --> 00:45:06,294
So?

762
00:45:06,295 --> 00:45:08,461
No, no, like at the bar.

763
00:45:09,861 --> 00:45:12,186
Not in the bathroom, not anywhere else.

764
00:45:12,187 --> 00:45:13,638
At the end of the night we were trying to

765
00:45:13,639 --> 00:45:15,209
figure out where her shirt was.

766
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:16,566
(laughing)

767
00:45:16,567 --> 00:45:19,276
And the guy was a complete creeper.

768
00:45:19,277 --> 00:45:20,693
(laughing)

769
00:45:20,694 --> 00:45:22,975
I can't even picture you doing that.

770
00:45:22,976 --> 00:45:25,545
And she can't, she can't
even remember doing it.

771
00:45:25,546 --> 00:45:27,222
I still think you guys
made the whole thing up.

772
00:45:27,223 --> 00:45:28,435
Oh, yeah.

773
00:45:28,436 --> 00:45:30,149
We all thought it would
be funny to make up

774
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:31,889
that you got out of control drunk.

775
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:33,449
Well, I learned my lesson.

776
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:34,948
I never got like that again.

777
00:45:34,949 --> 00:45:37,000
Yes, this is true.

778
00:45:37,001 --> 00:45:37,997
What was that?

779
00:45:37,998 --> 00:45:39,308
What was what?

780
00:45:39,309 --> 00:45:41,298
I thought I heard something.

781
00:45:41,299 --> 00:45:42,417
Really?

782
00:45:42,418 --> 00:45:44,223
Are you really trying
to scare us right now?

783
00:45:44,224 --> 00:45:45,152
I'm being serious.

784
00:45:45,153 --> 00:45:48,246
I really thought I heard something.

785
00:45:48,247 --> 00:45:49,687
Veronika, if you think
you're gonna scare us,

786
00:45:49,688 --> 00:45:51,258
you're dead wrong.

787
00:45:51,259 --> 00:45:52,991
Let's just go back upstairs.

788
00:45:52,992 --> 00:45:55,699
No, I want to figure out where she is.

789
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:59,261
I don't know what she
could be doing in my house.

790
00:45:59,262 --> 00:46:00,225
If there were any guys here,

791
00:46:00,226 --> 00:46:01,805
we'd know who she'd be doing.

792
00:46:01,806 --> 00:46:03,292
Okay, be nice.

793
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:05,370
So why don't you check the attic

794
00:46:05,371 --> 00:46:06,713
and you go check the bedrooms.

795
00:46:06,714 --> 00:46:08,129
Why do I have to check the attic?

796
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:09,666
Because you're the cop.

797
00:46:09,667 --> 00:46:11,477
You're not supposed to
be afraid of anything.

798
00:46:11,478 --> 00:46:13,532
I'm not afraid, I'm just asking.

799
00:46:13,533 --> 00:46:15,979
Sure you're not afraid
of anything, super cop.

800
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:17,397
Bite me, bitch.

801
00:46:18,618 --> 00:46:19,451
Come on.

802
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,147
If Veronika came into the attic,

803
00:46:45,148 --> 00:46:48,148
she's dumber than I thought she was.

804
00:46:54,154 --> 00:46:56,821
Then again, I guess I'm up here.

805
00:46:59,282 --> 00:47:01,365
Maybe I'm the stupid one.

806
00:47:08,399 --> 00:47:11,524
(clicking)
(gasping)

807
00:47:11,525 --> 00:47:12,858
What was that?

808
00:47:14,425 --> 00:47:17,925
(eerie suspenseful music)

809
00:47:40,843 --> 00:47:42,059
Get a grip, Izzy.

810
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:44,810
You're gonna make yourself crazy.

811
00:47:46,432 --> 00:47:48,250
(sighing)

812
00:47:48,251 --> 00:47:50,501
(giggling)

813
00:47:53,924 --> 00:47:57,177
(dramatic music)

814
00:47:57,178 --> 00:47:59,428
(thudding)

815
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:16,213
Alice?

816
00:48:17,069 --> 00:48:18,402
Are you in here?

817
00:48:22,736 --> 00:48:25,819
(panicked breathing)

818
00:48:30,989 --> 00:48:32,337
(screaming)

819
00:48:32,338 --> 00:48:34,230
Oh, thank God it's you.

820
00:48:34,231 --> 00:48:35,885
What are you screaming about?

821
00:48:35,886 --> 00:48:37,590
Something bad's happened!

822
00:48:37,591 --> 00:48:38,591
Why, what happened?

823
00:48:38,592 --> 00:48:39,957
Did you find Veronika?

824
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:40,917
I found Alice.

825
00:48:40,917 --> 00:48:41,750
Where?

826
00:48:41,751 --> 00:48:42,833
Over there.

827
00:48:45,136 --> 00:48:47,781
Are you sure that's hers?

828
00:48:47,782 --> 00:48:50,462
It's the shirt she was wearing.

829
00:48:50,463 --> 00:48:51,779
Then where is she?

830
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:53,773
I don't know.

831
00:48:53,774 --> 00:48:55,941
But that's a lot of blood.

832
00:48:57,536 --> 00:48:58,369
Could it be...

833
00:48:58,369 --> 00:48:59,208
God, don't even say it!

834
00:48:59,209 --> 00:49:01,729
I was gonna say could it
be that she cut herself?

835
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:02,563
Oh.

836
00:49:03,595 --> 00:49:07,012
If that were the case, then where is she?

837
00:49:08,725 --> 00:49:11,281
Well, I don't see her body.

838
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:13,532
But that is a lot of blood.

839
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:18,098
Oh God, I think we're in trouble.

840
00:49:18,099 --> 00:49:21,052
I think Rick's here and he's pissed.

841
00:49:21,053 --> 00:49:23,386
Why would Rick kill Alice?

842
00:49:25,553 --> 00:49:28,603
So you agree Alice is dead?

843
00:49:28,604 --> 00:49:30,521
I don't see her body.

844
00:49:31,495 --> 00:49:33,850
But that is a lot of blood.

845
00:49:33,851 --> 00:49:36,370
He's gonna, he's gonna kill all of us.

846
00:49:36,371 --> 00:49:38,338
He's gonna kill all of us. (crying)

847
00:49:38,339 --> 00:49:39,382
Okay, let's just think about this

848
00:49:39,383 --> 00:49:41,158
logically for a minute.

849
00:49:41,159 --> 00:49:42,187
We don't know if this is Rick

850
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:44,424
and we don't know if Alice is dead.

851
00:49:44,425 --> 00:49:47,951
How many other crazy
psychos do you know?

852
00:49:47,952 --> 00:49:51,417
Kelly broke up with Rick
because he was abusive,

853
00:49:51,418 --> 00:49:53,494
and not just verbally.

854
00:49:53,495 --> 00:49:55,962
I know, but do you
really think he'd kill

855
00:49:55,963 --> 00:49:57,963
all of us because of it?

856
00:49:59,043 --> 00:50:00,882
So you think it's possible he's gonna

857
00:50:00,883 --> 00:50:02,455
kill all of us?

858
00:50:02,456 --> 00:50:04,687
Oh, oh my God, what do we do?

859
00:50:04,688 --> 00:50:05,688
Calm down.

860
00:50:07,074 --> 00:50:08,142
Okay, I never said it was Rick

861
00:50:08,143 --> 00:50:10,256
and I never said he was
gonna kill all of us.

862
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:11,674
Then who is it?

863
00:50:13,637 --> 00:50:16,637
You're a sick fuck, you know that?

864
00:50:17,667 --> 00:50:20,429
Please, you can just let me go.

865
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:22,128
I won't say anything, I promise.

866
00:50:22,129 --> 00:50:25,705
Just, you can let me go
and no one will know.

867
00:50:25,706 --> 00:50:29,706
Just please let me go. (crying)

868
00:50:33,468 --> 00:50:36,551
(panicked breathing)

869
00:50:40,378 --> 00:50:42,711
(screaming)

870
00:51:05,992 --> 00:51:10,159
(whimpering)
(dramatic music)

871
00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:38,577
(screaming and crying)
(ominous music)

872
00:53:18,752 --> 00:53:21,502
(knife scraping)

873
00:53:29,324 --> 00:53:33,491
(whimpering and screaming)
(ominous music)

874
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:02,360
(muffled whimpering)

875
00:54:06,713 --> 00:54:10,880
(screaming)
(staple gun clicking)

876
00:54:19,718 --> 00:54:23,885
(crying)
(ominous music)

877
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:38,437
(screaming)
(staple gun clicking)

878
00:54:43,479 --> 00:54:47,646
(crying)
(ominous music)

879
00:54:55,071 --> 00:54:57,509
All right, this conversation's
getting us nowhere.

880
00:54:57,510 --> 00:55:00,781
Then what do you suggest we do?

881
00:55:00,782 --> 00:55:01,615
Well.

882
00:55:02,634 --> 00:55:04,505
(sighing)

883
00:55:04,506 --> 00:55:06,162
Let's try to find Kelly and Veronika.

884
00:55:06,163 --> 00:55:07,287
We'll show them what we found

885
00:55:07,288 --> 00:55:10,160
and then try to figure out
what happened to Alice.

886
00:55:10,161 --> 00:55:10,994
(crying)

887
00:55:10,995 --> 00:55:13,079
Rick's gonna kill us.

888
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:13,913
Come on.

889
00:55:19,028 --> 00:55:21,695
(ominous music)

890
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:27,612
(crying and whimpering)

891
00:55:37,885 --> 00:55:42,052
(screaming)
(ominous music)

892
00:55:44,665 --> 00:55:46,915
(thudding)

893
00:55:59,041 --> 00:56:03,208
(dramatic music)
(screaming)

894
00:56:23,762 --> 00:56:25,093
Cellphones.

895
00:56:25,094 --> 00:56:25,927
What?

896
00:56:25,927 --> 00:56:26,760
Our cellphones.

897
00:56:26,761 --> 00:56:28,085
Let's go downstairs and get them.

898
00:56:28,086 --> 00:56:30,831
Then we can call for help!

899
00:56:30,832 --> 00:56:33,499
(ominous music)

900
00:56:40,984 --> 00:56:43,178
Where the heck are our phones?

901
00:56:43,179 --> 00:56:45,573
I know I left mine sitting out.

902
00:56:45,574 --> 00:56:46,491
So did I.

903
00:56:47,446 --> 00:56:48,708
Someone must've taken them.

904
00:56:48,709 --> 00:56:49,641
Oh!

905
00:56:49,642 --> 00:56:50,988
What are we gonna do? (crying)

906
00:56:50,989 --> 00:56:51,989
Stay calm.

907
00:56:54,398 --> 00:56:55,927
Did you bring your gun with you?

908
00:56:55,928 --> 00:56:57,329
No, I left it at home.

909
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:59,726
Aren't you supposed to have
it with you all the time?

910
00:56:59,727 --> 00:57:01,361
I didn't think I would need it tonight!

911
00:57:01,362 --> 00:57:02,747
Well, you do!

912
00:57:02,748 --> 00:57:04,010
All right, there's
gotta be something else

913
00:57:04,011 --> 00:57:07,094
in the house we can use just in case.

914
00:57:08,208 --> 00:57:09,278
The kitchen!

915
00:57:09,279 --> 00:57:11,002
A knife, we can get a knife!

916
00:57:11,003 --> 00:57:11,836
Come on.

917
00:57:14,763 --> 00:57:15,596
(screaming)

918
00:57:15,597 --> 00:57:16,679
Quick! Run!

919
00:57:18,381 --> 00:57:21,048
(ominous music)

920
00:57:31,773 --> 00:57:33,856
(crying)

921
00:58:30,358 --> 00:58:32,691
(screaming)

922
00:58:36,452 --> 00:58:39,369
(punches smacking)

923
00:58:42,999 --> 00:58:44,811
Pull off his mask.

924
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:45,645
Okay.

925
00:58:45,646 --> 00:58:47,978
Okay, Rick, the jig is up!

926
00:58:49,427 --> 00:58:50,750
Who's that?

927
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:52,183
I don't know.

928
00:58:52,184 --> 00:58:53,812
(crying)

929
00:58:53,813 --> 00:58:55,276
Help me get him to the
room so we can tie him up

930
00:58:55,277 --> 00:58:57,594
before he regains consciousness.

931
00:58:57,595 --> 00:58:59,678
(crying)

932
00:59:09,159 --> 00:59:10,967
What should we do with him?

933
00:59:10,968 --> 00:59:13,224
Should just kill him.

934
00:59:13,225 --> 00:59:15,528
We should find out why he's doing this

935
00:59:15,529 --> 00:59:18,193
or at least who he is.

936
00:59:18,194 --> 00:59:19,665
We should figure out
where everyone else is

937
00:59:19,666 --> 00:59:22,249
and see if they know who he is.

938
00:59:23,198 --> 00:59:25,281
Or we can just ask him.

939
00:59:29,792 --> 00:59:30,792
Who are you?

940
00:59:33,321 --> 00:59:34,154
Boo!

941
00:59:34,155 --> 00:59:36,549
(screaming)

942
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:38,633
(crying)

943
00:59:40,216 --> 00:59:41,817
Who are you?

944
00:59:41,818 --> 00:59:44,290
And did you kill our friends?

945
00:59:44,291 --> 00:59:47,352
You're so concerned about who I am,

946
00:59:47,353 --> 00:59:50,017
but do you really know
who your friends are?

947
00:59:50,018 --> 00:59:51,970
This is bullshit!

948
00:59:51,971 --> 00:59:53,971
We should just kill him.

949
00:59:57,139 --> 00:59:59,938
Why are you doing this?

950
00:59:59,939 --> 01:00:03,700
Maybe I'm not the one
with the motivation.

951
01:00:03,701 --> 01:00:04,775
What?

952
01:00:04,776 --> 01:00:06,041
He's screwing with your head.

953
01:00:06,042 --> 01:00:09,432
Yes, that's exactly what I'm doing.

954
01:00:09,433 --> 01:00:11,832
I'm screwing with your head.

955
01:00:11,833 --> 01:00:14,498
It makes sense that I
would screw with your head.

956
01:00:14,499 --> 01:00:16,703
But ask yourself,

957
01:00:16,704 --> 01:00:18,454
why would I pick you?

958
01:00:22,241 --> 01:00:23,878
What do you mean?

959
01:00:23,879 --> 01:00:25,384
He's just screwing with you!

960
01:00:25,385 --> 01:00:27,848
I don't think she wants me to talk.

961
01:00:27,849 --> 01:00:29,178
I wonder why that is.

962
01:00:29,179 --> 01:00:30,012
[Pam] Shut up!

963
01:00:30,013 --> 01:00:33,179
(punch smacking)
Ah!

964
01:00:36,537 --> 01:00:37,370
Psst.

965
01:00:39,127 --> 01:00:40,615
Come here.

966
01:00:40,616 --> 01:00:42,949
I have a secret to tell you.

967
01:00:46,058 --> 01:00:48,141
(crying)

968
01:00:50,308 --> 01:00:51,968
What is it?

969
01:00:51,969 --> 01:00:53,886
I have an accomplice.

970
01:00:55,375 --> 01:00:56,811
There are two of you?

971
01:00:56,812 --> 01:00:58,375
Yes.

972
01:00:58,376 --> 01:00:59,769
And the second person
is someone you thought

973
01:00:59,770 --> 01:01:01,103
was your friend.

974
01:01:02,202 --> 01:01:04,952
Someone you think is your friend.

975
01:01:07,218 --> 01:01:08,227
Who is it?

976
01:01:08,228 --> 01:01:09,061
Isabel!

977
01:01:09,969 --> 01:01:12,176
He's messing with your head.

978
01:01:12,177 --> 01:01:13,844
Stop talking to him!

979
01:01:14,758 --> 01:01:15,591
Mmm.

980
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:18,323
Think about it.

981
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:22,855
This is bullshit!

982
01:01:22,856 --> 01:01:25,606
Don't listen to anything he says.

983
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:29,253
Okay.

984
01:01:31,709 --> 01:01:33,232
Go to the kitchen and get a knife.

985
01:01:33,233 --> 01:01:36,821
We're gonna get some answers from him.

986
01:01:36,822 --> 01:01:39,405
Go!
(screaming)

987
01:01:42,461 --> 01:01:45,128
(ominous music)

988
01:01:48,491 --> 01:01:51,574
(panicked breathing)

989
01:02:03,663 --> 01:02:04,888
[Pam] Ah!

990
01:02:04,889 --> 01:02:06,525
Alice, there you are.

991
01:02:06,526 --> 01:02:07,953
Are you okay?

992
01:02:07,954 --> 01:02:09,560
I'm not sure.

993
01:02:09,561 --> 01:02:10,505
[Pam] Isabel and I were worried.

994
01:02:10,506 --> 01:02:11,993
We found your shirt with blood on it.

995
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:14,734
Yeah, I cut myself when he attacked me.

996
01:02:14,735 --> 01:02:16,869
I managed to escape and I've been hiding.

997
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:18,715
We were looking for you and Veronika.

998
01:02:18,716 --> 01:02:21,151
Veronika's hiding with me.

999
01:02:21,152 --> 01:02:23,972
She twisted her ankle, so she can't walk.

1000
01:02:23,973 --> 01:02:25,098
Come on, I'll take you to her.

1001
01:02:25,099 --> 01:02:26,517
Okay.

1002
01:02:26,518 --> 01:02:29,185
(ominous music)

1003
01:02:32,979 --> 01:02:33,812
She's in here.

1004
01:02:33,813 --> 01:02:35,294
We've been hiding in the bathroom.

1005
01:02:35,295 --> 01:02:36,501
Isabel.

1006
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:37,991
(ominous music)

1007
01:02:37,992 --> 01:02:38,825
Oh, shit.

1008
01:02:44,122 --> 01:02:46,205
Welcome back, princess.

1009
01:02:48,779 --> 01:02:51,540
Aw, don't look so shocked.

1010
01:02:51,541 --> 01:02:53,290
I could only take so much of all your shit

1011
01:02:53,291 --> 01:02:55,113
for so long.

1012
01:02:55,114 --> 01:02:55,947
Why?

1013
01:02:57,343 --> 01:02:59,221
Let me think.

1014
01:02:59,222 --> 01:03:00,139
Oh, I know.

1015
01:03:01,401 --> 01:03:03,716
When Veronika was fucking my boyfriend

1016
01:03:03,717 --> 01:03:05,436
and all of you knew!

1017
01:03:05,437 --> 01:03:07,756
What were we supposed to do?

1018
01:03:07,757 --> 01:03:10,926
You must not know what friendship is.

1019
01:03:10,927 --> 01:03:12,911
Not letting your friend know

1020
01:03:12,912 --> 01:03:14,495
when her boyfriend is sleeping with a slut

1021
01:03:14,496 --> 01:03:16,320
behind her back.

1022
01:03:16,321 --> 01:03:18,036
That isn't a friend.

1023
01:03:18,037 --> 01:03:21,373
We should've told you, but
we didn't want to hurt you.

1024
01:03:21,374 --> 01:03:23,421
You didn't want to hurt me.

1025
01:03:23,422 --> 01:03:24,839
That is so sweet.

1026
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:28,740
It did hurt me.

1027
01:03:28,741 --> 01:03:30,648
More than just being cheated on.

1028
01:03:30,649 --> 01:03:33,086
More than just being betrayed by Veronika.

1029
01:03:33,087 --> 01:03:36,116
Because all of my friends betrayed me.

1030
01:03:36,117 --> 01:03:39,686
And now I'm going to hurt you all.

1031
01:03:39,687 --> 01:03:43,357
Oops, I already killed
Veronika, Isabel and Kelly.

1032
01:03:43,358 --> 01:03:46,108
Now it's just you I want to hurt.

1033
01:03:47,315 --> 01:03:49,857
And where does Mr. Charming
here fit into the picture?

1034
01:03:49,858 --> 01:03:53,189
Someone wants me to do all
of the detective work for her.

1035
01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:57,223
Maybe I should bring
her to the other room

1036
01:03:57,224 --> 01:03:59,362
and work her over a little.

1037
01:03:59,363 --> 01:04:01,098
What do you mean?

1038
01:04:01,099 --> 01:04:02,587
You know.

1039
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:04,015
Just have a little bit of fun.

1040
01:04:04,016 --> 01:04:08,471
Hey, Alice, when he
was tied up, we kissed.

1041
01:04:08,472 --> 01:04:09,405
Shut up.

1042
01:04:09,406 --> 01:04:10,908
He told me I'm a better kisser than you.

1043
01:04:10,909 --> 01:04:11,834
I said shut up!

1044
01:04:11,835 --> 01:04:13,471
He even copped a feel, too.

1045
01:04:13,472 --> 01:04:14,421
More than a feel.

1046
01:04:14,422 --> 01:04:15,587
I said shut up!

1047
01:04:15,588 --> 01:04:17,352
(slap smacking)

1048
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:20,216
(grunting)

1049
01:04:20,217 --> 01:04:22,884
(ominous music)

1050
01:04:36,523 --> 01:04:37,356
Find her!

1051
01:04:44,197 --> 01:04:46,947
(dramatic music)

1052
01:04:48,792 --> 01:04:50,875
(crying)

1053
01:05:18,269 --> 01:05:19,389
Where is she?

1054
01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:20,226
I can't find her.

1055
01:05:20,227 --> 01:05:21,400
If she gets away, we're finished.

1056
01:05:21,401 --> 01:05:22,265
Do you understand me?

1057
01:05:22,265 --> 01:05:23,102
We will find her.

1058
01:05:23,103 --> 01:05:24,702
We better.

1059
01:05:24,703 --> 01:05:25,786
Now find her!

1060
01:05:36,562 --> 01:05:39,562
(suspenseful music)

1061
01:06:13,263 --> 01:06:16,416
(elbow smacking)

1062
01:06:16,417 --> 01:06:20,584
(choking)
(coughing)

1063
01:06:23,258 --> 01:06:24,785
You're crazy, you know that?

1064
01:06:24,786 --> 01:06:26,039
I wouldn't say crazy.

1065
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,957
Just really pissed off.

1066
01:06:28,835 --> 01:06:30,279
Why can't you make my life easier

1067
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:32,604
and just die like you're supposed to?

1068
01:06:32,605 --> 01:06:33,438
No!

1069
01:06:35,494 --> 01:06:36,623
No!

1070
01:06:36,624 --> 01:06:39,291
(ominous music)

1071
01:06:40,170 --> 01:06:42,420
(groaning)

1072
01:06:54,539 --> 01:06:55,564
Ah!

1073
01:06:55,565 --> 01:06:58,232
(ominous music)

1074
01:07:10,952 --> 01:07:12,336
It hurts.

1075
01:07:12,337 --> 01:07:13,587
It hurts badly.

1076
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:17,961
Everyone is going to think
you and Pam killed everyone.

1077
01:07:17,962 --> 01:07:20,625
I was just the lone
survivor of this nightmare,

1078
01:07:20,626 --> 01:07:23,142
terrified and traumatized.

1079
01:07:23,143 --> 01:07:25,665
They'll all have sympathies for me.

1080
01:07:25,666 --> 01:07:27,499
Uh, I need a doctor.

1081
01:07:28,668 --> 01:07:30,835
You don't need a doctor.

1082
01:07:35,811 --> 01:07:38,478
(ominous music)

1083
01:08:33,823 --> 01:08:35,472
[Woman] Are you just
gonna let her keep laughing

1084
01:08:35,473 --> 01:08:38,285
at you like everyone else does?

1085
01:08:38,286 --> 01:08:40,694
What are you gonna do about it?

1086
01:08:40,695 --> 01:08:42,541
Hello, hello.

1087
01:08:42,542 --> 01:08:45,510
What beautiful, beautiful
brown eyes you have.

1088
01:08:45,511 --> 01:08:49,218
The better to watch
yourself die with, huh?

1089
01:08:49,219 --> 01:08:50,621
Yes.

1090
01:08:50,622 --> 01:08:52,700
You know, they'd make a
nice, little keepsake,

1091
01:08:52,701 --> 01:08:53,993
wouldn't they?

1092
01:08:53,994 --> 01:08:56,010
Would I be able to keep them?

1093
01:08:56,011 --> 01:08:56,853
Do you mind?

1094
01:08:56,853 --> 01:08:57,686
(whimpering)

1095
01:08:57,687 --> 01:08:59,244
Of course you don't mind.

1096
01:08:59,245 --> 01:09:01,741
And who cares, because
I can pluck them out.

1097
01:09:01,742 --> 01:09:06,482
I'll pluck them out of your
pretty, little head, won't I?

1098
01:09:06,483 --> 01:09:07,976
Could I ask you a question?

1099
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:11,633
Now that I have your undivided attention.

1100
01:09:11,634 --> 01:09:12,901
What is it?

1101
01:09:12,902 --> 01:09:15,055
Why is it that girls like you always

1102
01:09:15,056 --> 01:09:17,249
ignore men like me?

1103
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:18,093
Why is it?

1104
01:09:18,093 --> 01:09:19,041
Why do you have a club?

1105
01:09:19,042 --> 01:09:20,441
You have a club and
you hate us, don't you?

1106
01:09:20,442 --> 01:09:21,275
No!

1107
01:09:21,275 --> 01:09:22,108
- You hate us.
- No!

1108
01:09:22,109 --> 01:09:23,131
You do, you do.

1109
01:09:23,132 --> 01:09:25,351
It doesn't matter, doesn't matter because

1110
01:09:25,352 --> 01:09:27,271
you're gonna die anyway.

1111
01:09:27,272 --> 01:09:29,272
In fact, I'd like to
see what you're made of.

1112
01:09:29,273 --> 01:09:31,541
Let's see what you're made of, huh?

1113
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:33,608
Let's see exactly what's inside you.

1114
01:09:33,609 --> 01:09:35,994
Yeah, let's see what's inside you.

1115
01:09:35,995 --> 01:09:38,196
Yes, exactly! (laughing)

1116
01:09:38,197 --> 01:09:40,557
(bat thumping)

1117
01:09:40,558 --> 01:09:42,808
That's enough out of you.

1118
01:09:48,717 --> 01:09:50,140
Thank you.

1119
01:09:50,141 --> 01:09:51,882
Thank you, Roy.

1120
01:09:51,883 --> 01:20:00,000
(soft piano music)
