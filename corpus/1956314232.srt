the verb "exit"

JUNE: Maybe it'll
never really fully go away.

1383
01:12:18,317 --> 01:12:20,715
Maybe it's there
to remind us

1384
01:12:20,717 --> 01:12:24,417
to look at the light
that surrounds us.

Come on, I'll let you buy me
some popcorn.

1392

Yep, I'll be right there!
I just need to... Well...

1393
01:12:48,217 --> 01:12:50,648

June, are you okay?
What happened to you?

1409
01:13:54,817 --> 01:13:58,682
I'm so sorry for being gone a whole
night and not telling you where I was.

1410
01:13:58,684 --> 01:14:02,148
What? I just dropped you off
at Math Camp 30 minutes ago.

Never mind.

1413
01:14:10,517 --> 01:14:12,782
If you did this because
you're worried about me...

1414
01:14:12,784 --> 01:14:14,650
Worry? About you?

1415
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:16,517
You're fine!

1416
01:14:17,183 --> 01:14:19,250
Actually, you're awesome.

1417
01:14:20,584 --> 01:14:21,682
Hmm.

1418
01:14:21,684 --> 01:14:23,916
I have so much
to tell Mom about.

1419
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:27,315
Uh, Junie...

1420
01:14:27,317 --> 01:14:28,648
And before you bring up
going back to Math Camp,

1421
01:14:28,650 --> 01:14:29,782
you have to know

1422
01:14:29,784 --> 01:14:31,115
it's not happening.

1423
01:14:31,117 --> 01:14:32,715
I have
way too much work to do.

1424
01:14:32,717 --> 01:14:35,350
- Such as?
- Making up for lost time.

1425
01:14:36,183 --> 01:14:37,350
Is that...

Can you get that?

Sure thing, Dad.

1433
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:07,281
I strung up all the banners.
What's next?

1434
01:15:07,283 --> 01:15:11,081
Great. Can you make a balloon
arch over the back fence?

1435
01:15:11,083 --> 01:15:12,350
- Yep!
- Thanks.

(DOORBELL RINGING)

1437
01:15:15,150 --> 01:15:18,281
When you say over the back
fence, do you mean

1438
01:15:18,283 --> 01:15:22,515
over the fence, like over it,
or over the fence, like behind it?

1439

Over the fence, like over it.

1440
01:15:24,417 --> 01:15:27,450
Oh. Ding!
Over the fence. Got it.

I got to finish.

get the door, June.

- A Ferris wheel!
- That's a great idea.

But are we thinking just like
a regular old Ferris wheel?

A Ferris wheel
made out of glow sticks.
