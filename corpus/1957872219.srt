They need help.

1386
01:24:07,517 --> 01:24:11,275
And sometimes innocent people
get hurt by their illness.

1387
01:24:11,413 --> 01:24:14,586
But you don't
have anything to worry about.

1388
01:24:14,724 --> 01:24:18,137
I'm here, and I love you.

1389
01:24:18,275 --> 01:24:21,310
Will you stay with me
for a while? I'm afraid.

1390
01:24:21,448 --> 01:24:24,241
Afraid of the monster.
Oh, sure, baby.

1391
01:24:24,379 --> 01:24:26,620
I'm just gonna make sure
the door's locked, okay?

1392
01:24:26,758 --> 01:24:27,724
I'll be right back.

1393
01:24:27,862 --> 01:24:29,344
But what if
the monster comes back?

1394
01:24:29,482 --> 01:24:32,793
Oh, honey, mmm! He won't.

1395
01:24:35,275 --> 01:24:37,068
I'll be one minute.

1396
01:24:41,241 --> 01:24:45,965
Here, while I'm gone,
you hold this.

1397
01:24:46,103 --> 01:24:48,586
You don't have
anything to worry about.

1398
01:24:48,724 --> 01:24:51,000
What do I always tell you?

1399
01:24:51,137 --> 01:24:52,758
Daddy watches over us.

1400
01:24:54,241 --> 01:24:58,172
And Daddy will protect you
from the monster, okay?

1401
01:24:58,310 --> 01:24:59,655
Mmm.

1402
01:25:05,482 --> 01:25:08,482
You'll protect me
from the monster, Daddy.

1403
01:25:08,620 --> 01:25:10,517
You'll protect me.

1404
01:25:10,655 --> 01:25:13,586
