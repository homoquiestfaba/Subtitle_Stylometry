NARRATOR: When a
travelerin north central Louisiana

2
00:00:26,548 --> 00:00:29,681
takes a wrong fork at
thejunction of Boudreaux Road,

3
00:00:29,812 --> 00:00:32,293
just beyond Thibodeau's
Corners, he comes

4
00:00:32,423 --> 00:00:34,556
upon a lonely, curious country.

5
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,303
[music playing]

6
00:00:47,351 --> 00:00:51,442
Here sits the Whateley house,
a cold, desolate place.

7
00:00:51,573 --> 00:00:54,228
Hundreds of years ago,
whenthe talk of voodoo and Satan

8
00:00:54,358 --> 00:00:58,014
worship was commonplace,
thelocals would warn strangers

9
00:00:58,145 --> 00:01:00,147
to stay far, far away.

10
00:01:06,762 --> 00:01:11,027
It was here, 10 years ago,
that the unimaginable happened,

11
00:01:11,158 --> 00:01:14,030
the unspeakable.

12
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:15,858
Athena Whateley.

13
00:01:15,988 --> 00:01:19,079
She was 35 years old.

14
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:20,906
She did nothing to
hide her pregnancy

15
00:01:21,037 --> 00:01:23,735
to others in that small town.

16
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:27,435
She never spoke of
the child [inaudible]..

17
00:01:27,565 --> 00:01:32,396
Some conjectured that OldMan Whateley,
her father,

18
00:01:32,527 --> 00:01:35,095
was responsible
for her pregnancy.

19
00:01:35,225 --> 00:01:39,795
Those wounds were too sinister,
even for this small town.

20
00:01:39,925 --> 00:01:43,277
Any reference to such
a strange family.

21
00:01:43,407 --> 00:01:46,149
[screaming]

22
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,152
I see it.

23
00:01:49,283 --> 00:01:51,546
Here it comes, Logan.

24
00:01:51,676 --> 00:01:54,505
[screaming]

25
00:01:57,595 --> 00:02:00,381
[baby crying]

26
00:02:03,993 --> 00:02:06,343
It's a boy.

27
00:02:06,474 --> 00:02:09,216
[baby crying]

28
00:02:26,102 --> 00:02:29,497
He... he beautiful.

29
00:02:29,627 --> 00:02:30,976
Yes, dear.

30
00:02:31,107 --> 00:02:33,936
[music playing]

00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:40,377

[woman crying]

38
00:05:05,174 --> 00:05:06,523
WOMAN: Why is this happening?

39
00:05:06,654 --> 00:05:09,526
I want my baby back.

40
00:05:09,657 --> 00:05:11,006
It's gonna be OK.

41
00:05:11,136 --> 00:05:12,486
It's gonna be OK.

42
00:05:23,975 --> 00:05:26,804
[crying]

43
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:43,691
Father?

44
00:05:43,821 --> 00:05:44,605
PRIEST: It's all right.

45
00:05:44,735 --> 00:05:46,041
It's all right.

46
00:05:46,171 --> 00:05:48,739
The cut isn't bad.

47
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:49,653
I'll go.

48
00:05:49,784 --> 00:05:50,567
PRIEST: No way.

49
00:05:50,698 --> 00:05:53,222
It's too... too powerful.

50
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,703
If I can't do anything,
there's little that you can do.

51
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:56,617
I can try.

52
00:05:56,747 --> 00:05:59,489
[knocking at door]

53
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:06,148
PRIEST: Dr. Alridge, thank God.

54
00:06:06,278 --> 00:06:08,585
It's much worse
than when I called.

55
00:06:08,716 --> 00:06:10,282
This is my
associate, Dr. Morgan.

56
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:19,553
Good evening.

57
00:06:19,683 --> 00:06:20,989
Good evening.

58
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:24,079
May I ask you how long
you've owned this house?

59
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:25,209
Two months.

60
00:06:27,691 --> 00:06:30,390
She started acting
strangeright after we moved in.

61
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,003
She's home on a
break from college,

62
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:37,527
and we were just hoping
tospend some time with her.

63
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:38,833
Can you help us?

64
00:06:38,963 --> 00:06:42,053
Her room... was it
always a bedroom?

65
00:06:42,184 --> 00:06:43,184
Or was it an attic?

66
00:06:45,796 --> 00:06:47,929
WOMAN: It was an attic.

67
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:50,497
We just added a wall and
made it into her room.

68
00:06:50,627 --> 00:06:52,847
How much renovation?

69
00:06:52,977 --> 00:06:56,546
Uh, we added new
flooring and dry wall.

70
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,247
What does all of this haveto
do with what's going on?

71
00:07:02,378 --> 00:07:04,728
This house was built
by a Silas Brown,

72
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:08,471
a well-known practitioner of
theoccult and a demon worshipper.

73
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:10,168
DR. MORGAN: Chances
are good that he

74
00:07:10,299 --> 00:07:14,042
built something into the
roomto assist in his sorcery.

75
00:07:14,172 --> 00:07:15,541
DR. ALDRIDGE: And he
left something behind.

76
00:07:15,565 --> 00:07:17,828
Does the entity have a name?

77
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:18,959
Yes.

78
00:07:19,003 --> 00:07:20,309
[inaudible]

79
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,137
Splendid.

80
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:23,747
And give us 30 minutes.

81
00:07:23,878 --> 00:07:26,054
If we don't come out,
spread the contents of this

82
00:07:26,184 --> 00:07:29,710
over the entire doorway.

83
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,016
What is it?

84
00:07:32,147 --> 00:07:33,453
Just do as I ask.

85
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,463
PRIEST: Dr, you may want
to keep that jacket on.

86
00:07:38,762 --> 00:07:42,244
I'm just a simple girl.

87
00:07:42,374 --> 00:07:45,160
I just want to be left alone.

88
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,640
I just want to
play with my toys.

89
00:07:50,295 --> 00:07:51,383
I'll handle this.

90
00:07:51,514 --> 00:07:52,514
Try and find it.

91
00:08:06,964 --> 00:08:09,314
So what's your name?

92
00:08:09,445 --> 00:08:11,969
Caitlin.

93
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,319
DR. ALDRIDGE: Oh,
well, that's a quaint

94
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:19,673
name for a 60,000-year-oldalien demon.

95
00:08:19,803 --> 00:08:22,023
The gates are about to open.

96
00:08:24,982 --> 00:08:28,159
And I'll be the
first [inaudible]..

97
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,050
Well,
don't get toocomfortable because you're

98
00:08:30,074 --> 00:08:30,814
going right back.

99
00:08:30,945 --> 00:08:32,076
[laughter]

100
00:08:32,207 --> 00:08:33,207
Almost.

101
00:08:39,997 --> 00:08:40,781
Got it.

102
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:41,911
No!

103
00:08:44,872 --> 00:08:48,179
[pounding noise]

104
00:08:56,187 --> 00:08:59,495
[music playing]

105
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,461
Sumerian ritual pyramid.

106
00:09:09,592 --> 00:09:14,728
5,000 years old.

107
00:09:14,858 --> 00:09:18,209
[child laughing]

108
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:25,695
The pyramid!

109
00:09:25,826 --> 00:09:29,133
[music playing]

110
00:10:13,134 --> 00:10:14,134
Ipsil.

111
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:27,365
You all right, Faye?

112
00:10:27,496 --> 00:10:28,802
Yeah.

113
00:10:28,932 --> 00:10:31,543
I'm fine.

114
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:35,460
Top section always clockwise.

115
00:10:35,591 --> 00:10:36,810
Got it.

116
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,940
Won't happen again.

117
00:10:37,985 --> 00:10:40,770
Sure hope not.

118
00:10:40,901 --> 00:10:42,501
Someone or something
has opened a portal.

119
00:10:45,122 --> 00:10:47,603
We have to close it.

120
00:10:47,734 --> 00:10:50,606
So after reviewing
chapter 10, what

121
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:52,216
is the difference
between the Cthulu

122
00:10:52,347 --> 00:10:55,176
cults of ancientMesopotamia in comparison

123
00:10:55,306 --> 00:10:57,874
to the other polytheiticreligions
of similar cultures

124
00:10:58,005 --> 00:10:59,049
during the Iron Age?

125
00:11:06,753 --> 00:11:09,581
Ms. Badish?

126
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:11,540
No?

127
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,151
Mr. Jones?

128
00:11:14,282 --> 00:11:15,282
Mr. Jones?

129
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,984
Bryce, the only person
who seems to care.

130
00:11:21,115 --> 00:11:23,247
The Cthulhu deities
were all evil,

131
00:11:23,378 --> 00:11:25,293
unlike the Egyptians
and Greeks, who were

132
00:11:25,423 --> 00:11:27,251
benevolent and malevolent gods.

133
00:11:27,382 --> 00:11:28,470
That's correct.

134
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,602
Also, in James
Garland's book, he

135
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:32,779
hypothesizes that
these gods were

136
00:11:32,909 --> 00:11:35,782
actually extraterrestrials,
and primitive man...

137
00:11:35,912 --> 00:11:39,437
Yes, but that conversationis for next week.

138
00:11:39,568 --> 00:11:42,266
Also,
most cultures wentto their gods in the sky

139
00:11:42,397 --> 00:11:44,965
or on mountains, whereas
the Cthulhu [inaudible]

140
00:11:45,095 --> 00:11:46,401
living under the ocean.

141
00:11:46,531 --> 00:11:47,837
Thank you, Bryce.

142
00:11:47,968 --> 00:11:48,988
And that's what they
called [inaudible]..

143
00:11:49,012 --> 00:11:54,061
Bryce, that's quite enough.

144
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:56,846
Thank you.

145
00:11:56,977 --> 00:11:58,215
Well, I guess it's
about that time,

146
00:11:58,239 --> 00:12:01,329
so as our friend
Bryce alluded to,

147
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:05,072
let's discuss chapter one
ofDr. Garland's book next week.

148
00:12:05,202 --> 00:12:05,986
Thank you.

149
00:12:06,116 --> 00:12:07,116
Have a good day.

150
00:12:09,903 --> 00:12:11,078
Pardon me, Dr. Rice...

151
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:14,342
Bryce, office
hours are on Tuesday.

152
00:12:14,472 --> 00:12:19,869
I have an appointment today, OK?

153
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,629
I'll have your schedule
by 10:00 AM tomorrow.

154
00:12:21,653 --> 00:12:22,653
All right.

155
00:12:31,011 --> 00:12:35,842
That is not dead
which can eternal lie.

156
00:12:35,972 --> 00:12:40,890
Strange eons even death may die.

157
00:12:41,021 --> 00:12:43,240
Yeah.

158
00:12:43,371 --> 00:12:44,459
It's so good to see you.

159
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:45,460
Yeah.

160
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:46,940
Same here, my good friend.

161
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,724
It's been too long.

162
00:12:48,855 --> 00:12:49,899
Yes, it has.

163
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,772
We should grab a
coffee... catch up.

164
00:12:52,902 --> 00:12:54,861
What brings you all
the way up here?

165
00:12:54,991 --> 00:12:56,471
Oh, well, we brought
you another piece

166
00:12:56,601 --> 00:12:57,601
for the collection.

167
00:12:57,646 --> 00:12:58,646
We?

168
00:13:04,522 --> 00:13:05,522
Hello, Walter.

169
00:13:10,572 --> 00:13:12,356
Hi, Faye.

170
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:14,054
So you want to see the piece?

171
00:13:17,492 --> 00:13:20,277
WALTER: Definitely Sumerian.

172
00:13:20,408 --> 00:13:23,411
I'd put this at about 2000 BC.- 3000.

173
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,587
Look at the markings.

174
00:13:25,717 --> 00:13:27,154
I did.

175
00:13:27,284 --> 00:13:29,001
These markings are
consistentwith pre-Babylonian,

176
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:30,331
late first dynasty.

177
00:13:30,461 --> 00:13:32,309
But at first glance, at
the second tier glyphs...

178
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:33,595
He's the linguistic expert.

179
00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:36,816
Let him do the analysis, Faye.

180
00:13:36,946 --> 00:13:39,166
And just as Dr.
Garland suggested,

181
00:13:39,296 --> 00:13:41,385
articulated subsections.

182
00:13:41,516 --> 00:13:42,647
Have you tried to move them?

183
00:13:42,778 --> 00:13:43,561
No!

184
00:13:43,692 --> 00:13:45,128
No, stop!

185
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:51,047
[music playing]

186
00:13:51,178 --> 00:13:53,006
[SINGING] If it's broken,
please don't fix it.

187
00:13:53,136 --> 00:13:54,456
If it hurts, then
you can kill it.

188
00:14:04,931 --> 00:14:06,019
Gotta stretch my legs.

189
00:14:10,371 --> 00:14:12,068
Wow, these are old.

190
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:14,157
There's not even a
credit card terminal.

191
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:15,811
I'll go pay inside.

192
00:14:15,942 --> 00:14:16,812
All right, baby.

193
00:14:16,943 --> 00:14:18,137
Hey, I'll probably get a soda.

194
00:14:18,161 --> 00:14:19,441
You want something?
- Yeah, sure.

195
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:20,294
Just a water.

196
00:14:20,424 --> 00:14:21,512
OK.

197
00:14:21,643 --> 00:14:22,923
Hey, let's go ahead and fill up.

198
00:14:22,992 --> 00:14:24,100
We've still got three
hours to Houston.

199
00:14:24,124 --> 00:14:25,821
You got it, hot stuff.

200
00:15:46,902 --> 00:15:47,902
Do you have a bathroom?

201
00:15:53,778 --> 00:15:54,778
Thanks.

202
00:15:58,609 --> 00:15:59,480
Hey.

203
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:00,610
Bathroom.

204
00:16:00,655 --> 00:16:01,655
Save me that key, baby.

205
00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:02,699
Now I gotta go.

206
00:17:08,853 --> 00:17:11,204
[muffled shouting]

207
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,689
Yo.

208
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,083
[laughter] Yeah, man.

209
00:17:21,214 --> 00:17:23,390
We got about three
or four hours left.

210
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,782
Yeah, it's brutal, man.

211
00:17:24,913 --> 00:17:27,655
The I-10's all torn up.

212
00:17:27,785 --> 00:17:30,875
Yeah, we'll be seeing ya.

213
00:17:31,006 --> 00:17:39,006
Well... Yeah, all right.

214
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,710
That's great.

215
00:17:47,762 --> 00:17:50,417
With all due respect,
weare all far too educated

216
00:17:50,547 --> 00:17:54,682
to believe that this mythology,
this archeology that we've

217
00:17:54,812 --> 00:17:58,077
studied our entire
lives is real.

218
00:17:58,207 --> 00:18:00,383
You don't have to believe.

219
00:18:00,514 --> 00:18:02,777
Obtaining the book and
helping us translate it

220
00:18:02,907 --> 00:18:05,171
would be quite the
feather in your cap.

221
00:18:05,301 --> 00:18:08,217
It's because of truebelievers
like the two of you

222
00:18:08,348 --> 00:18:11,351
that securing the Necronomicon
would be extremely

223
00:18:11,481 --> 00:18:15,006
difficult, if not impossible.

224
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:16,617
It's hidden.

225
00:18:16,747 --> 00:18:18,793
And wherever it's hidden,
it's protected by cultists

226
00:18:18,923 --> 00:18:20,011
and religious fanatics.

227
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:21,665
So even if you
did find it, you'd

228
00:18:21,796 --> 00:18:24,451
probably be killed beforeyou
could ever bring it back.

229
00:18:24,581 --> 00:18:26,844
A portal has been
opened between our world

230
00:18:26,975 --> 00:18:29,804
and the realm of the old.

231
00:18:29,934 --> 00:18:32,415
With them come chaos
and destruction.

232
00:18:32,546 --> 00:18:33,677
Why do you need it?

233
00:18:33,808 --> 00:18:35,070
There are several translations.

234
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:36,637
I have one.

235
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:38,397
There's one in BuenosAires,
there's one in Paris.

236
00:18:38,421 --> 00:18:40,554
All of them are incomplete.

237
00:18:40,684 --> 00:18:42,469
Page 751.

238
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:45,907
Every copy,
every translationis missing page 751.

239
00:18:46,037 --> 00:18:49,389
That page contains
theincantations needed to open

240
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:52,043
the portal, and to close it.

241
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:54,872
Only the original has page 751.

242
00:18:55,003 --> 00:18:57,745
But I just don't see that...

243
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:02,445
At the very least,
it's animportant piece of history.

244
00:19:02,576 --> 00:19:06,145
Whoever retrieves it willbe
showered in accolades.

245
00:19:06,275 --> 00:19:08,495
Not to mention all
the research grants.

246
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:11,367
And the press.

247
00:19:11,498 --> 00:19:12,847
OK.

248
00:19:12,977 --> 00:19:14,817
I see where the two of
you are going with this.

249
00:19:18,069 --> 00:19:20,159
We'll have to compare notes.

250
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:22,073
Nobody's even seen the
original since John

251
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:25,033
Dee translated it in 1603.

252
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:33,164
Then we start at 1603.

253
00:19:35,957 --> 00:19:38,264
[static]

254
00:19:40,918 --> 00:19:44,226
We're gonna have a party, Agnes.

255
00:19:44,357 --> 00:19:48,143
It's my boys' birthdays,
and they're coming home.

256
00:19:48,274 --> 00:19:52,539
[laughter] We're gonna
getpretty pretty for my baby.

257
00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:59,415
[laughter] I can't
wait to see my baby.

258
00:20:05,943 --> 00:20:06,727
Shut up!

259
00:20:06,857 --> 00:20:07,857
Just shut up!

260
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:14,865
Wilbur's home.

261
00:20:14,996 --> 00:20:15,996
Wilbur!

262
00:20:18,782 --> 00:20:19,566
Wilbur's home!

263
00:20:19,696 --> 00:20:20,523
Wilbur!

264
00:20:20,654 --> 00:20:22,395
[laughter]

265
00:20:23,526 --> 00:20:24,701
Hello, Mother.

266
00:20:24,832 --> 00:20:25,702
Oh, whatcha got there?

267
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,138
A present for your brother?

268
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:30,141
Yes.

269
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:32,100
[laughter]

270
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,104
[screaming]

271
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,935
Well done, boy.

272
00:20:41,065 --> 00:20:42,371
Take care of your brother.

273
00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:47,419
Shh.

274
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,554
Soon it'll be all over for you.

275
00:20:58,213 --> 00:21:00,520
[demonic whispering]

276
00:21:03,697 --> 00:21:05,046
[screaming]

277
00:21:11,661 --> 00:21:14,011
[demonic whispering]

278
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:40,386
[demonic screaming]

279
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,826
This indicates that
Dee gave the original

280
00:21:45,956 --> 00:21:48,394
to the Anglican church.

281
00:21:48,524 --> 00:21:49,917
Well, that would explain this.

282
00:21:50,047 --> 00:21:52,311
An unnamed book with
great significance

283
00:21:52,441 --> 00:21:54,313
kept by the Knights
Templar in Scotland.

284
00:21:54,443 --> 00:21:57,577
Well, that was until
theylost that in a fire in 1789.

285
00:21:57,707 --> 00:21:59,318
A fire that was most
likely a diversion

286
00:21:59,448 --> 00:22:01,668
to steal the real book.

287
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:03,496
Well, where'd it go?

288
00:22:03,626 --> 00:22:05,149
America.

289
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,457
Taken here by a group
knownas the Black Brotherhood?

290
00:22:08,588 --> 00:22:09,371
Oh.

291
00:22:09,502 --> 00:22:12,156
Olas Wormius.

292
00:22:12,287 --> 00:22:14,463
The Dutch alchemist?

293
00:22:14,594 --> 00:22:16,247
Yes.

294
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:20,643
He translated the book
beforeJohn Dee translated the book.

295
00:22:20,774 --> 00:22:21,514
What are you thinking?

296
00:22:21,644 --> 00:22:22,428
Ask him.

297
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:24,343
He'll know.

298
00:22:24,473 --> 00:22:26,954
And how do we do that?

299
00:22:27,084 --> 00:22:29,739
A seance, or a psychic?

300
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,873
According to my calculations,
he died 700 years ago.

301
00:22:33,003 --> 00:22:36,659
He explained to me thetrue
history of the old ones.

302
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:39,793
The secret cults that
have existed forever.

303
00:22:39,923 --> 00:22:41,901
He claimed to have been
bornduring the Shang dynasty.

304
00:22:41,925 --> 00:22:43,231
Please.

305
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:48,410
That would make him
over 3,000 years old.

306
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:50,693
OK, far be it for me to guessthat
he's really in his mid 60s

307
00:22:50,717 --> 00:22:52,414
somewhere.
Where?

308
00:22:52,545 --> 00:22:54,436
Well, the last time I sawhim
was in southern Louisiana.

309
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,940
He was overseeing
avoodoo cult in the Bayou.

310
00:22:57,071 --> 00:22:59,029
What would he know?

311
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,684
He knew about the brotherhood,
and for a time he was a member.

312
00:23:01,815 --> 00:23:03,469
Yeah, he knows their secrets.

313
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:05,919
Well, it sounds like as gooda
place as any to start to me.

314
00:23:11,172 --> 00:23:12,826
You're gonna need this.

315
00:23:12,956 --> 00:23:14,978
I'm going to stay behind
andtry and figure out who or what

316
00:23:15,002 --> 00:23:16,882
is behind all this,
sowhen you obtain the book,

317
00:23:17,004 --> 00:23:19,528
well, we'll know
where to use it.

318
00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:20,659
Pick me up?
10?

319
00:23:20,747 --> 00:23:21,487
Mm.

320
00:23:21,617 --> 00:23:23,663
Same place?

321
00:23:23,793 --> 00:23:24,968
Do you live alone?

322
00:23:25,099 --> 00:23:26,619
I'd hate for it to
be awkward, and all.

323
00:23:28,537 --> 00:23:29,799
Wait outside.
I'll come out.

324
00:23:35,544 --> 00:23:37,241
You two kids are
going to be fine.

325
00:23:37,372 --> 00:23:39,113
Six years is a long time.

326
00:23:39,243 --> 00:23:42,159
You know, people move on.

327
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:43,290
Sometimes.

328
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:48,252
Are you going to be all right?

329
00:23:48,383 --> 00:23:49,776
Dealing with him?

330
00:23:49,906 --> 00:23:52,996
Well, our personal
history is just that.

331
00:23:53,127 --> 00:23:54,563
History.

332
00:23:54,694 --> 00:23:56,654
I'm more concerned
aboutinvolving him in general.

333
00:23:56,783 --> 00:23:57,890
Well, he's the only one that can

334
00:23:57,914 --> 00:23:59,960
translate the original text.

335
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,440
But he doesn't believe.

336
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:03,267
His believing is irrelevant.

337
00:24:03,398 --> 00:24:07,924
Once he translates it,
I'll perform the ritual.

338
00:24:08,055 --> 00:24:09,883
But they... they
prey on nonbelievers.

339
00:24:10,013 --> 00:24:11,406
Remember what
happened to Darelith?

340
00:24:11,537 --> 00:24:14,583
Well, before longhe'll see it for himself.

341
00:24:14,714 --> 00:24:17,499
Then we'll be glad to
have him on our side.

342
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,911
Let's just hope he doesn'tgive
up before we get that far.

343
00:25:22,085 --> 00:25:23,478
The time is close, boy.

344
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:29,702
Seven days until
your 10th birthday.

345
00:25:29,832 --> 00:25:33,009
You know what that means?

346
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,446
Yes.

347
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:38,188
You been practicing
for the big day?

348
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:39,929
I will be ready.

349
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,497
Henry paid me a visit yesterday.

350
00:25:42,628 --> 00:25:43,846
Henry Armitage?

351
00:25:43,977 --> 00:25:45,979
In the flesh.

352
00:25:46,109 --> 00:25:47,981
Was she with him?

353
00:25:48,111 --> 00:25:48,851
Yes.

354
00:25:48,982 --> 00:25:50,418
She was.

355
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:51,332
What do they want?

356
00:25:51,462 --> 00:25:52,638
Shame I missed them.

357
00:25:52,768 --> 00:25:54,006
I would have loved
to have said hello.

358
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,249
- You would have?
- No.

359
00:25:55,379 --> 00:25:56,163
Not really.

360
00:25:56,293 --> 00:25:57,817
What did they want?

361
00:25:57,947 --> 00:25:59,316
Well, they brought me
anew piece for the collection.

362
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,081
It's a Samaritan ritual pyramid.

363
00:26:01,211 --> 00:26:02,996
It's quite nice, really.

364
00:26:03,126 --> 00:26:05,651
And they also asked
for me to help

365
00:26:05,781 --> 00:26:09,219
them find the Necronomicon.

366
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,917
Well, what did you tell them?

367
00:26:11,047 --> 00:26:12,266
I said I would help.

368
00:26:12,396 --> 00:26:13,180
Why?

369
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,485
I don't know.

370
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:15,985
You're just feeding
their delusions.

371
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:16,749
It's not healthy.
- I know.

372
00:26:16,879 --> 00:26:18,011
I know.

373
00:26:18,141 --> 00:26:19,501
It's an important
piece of history.

374
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:22,232
Yeah, well, some relics
are best left buried.

375
00:26:22,363 --> 00:26:23,363
The missing pages.

376
00:26:26,715 --> 00:26:30,632
There is a copy at the
University in Arkham.

377
00:26:30,763 --> 00:26:33,940
I will steal it.

378
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,724
Good.

379
00:26:35,855 --> 00:26:37,528
Henry was going on abouta portal,
or something.

380
00:26:37,552 --> 00:26:39,859
He said that all thecopies
of the Necronomicon

381
00:26:39,989 --> 00:26:42,035
are missing page 751.

382
00:26:42,165 --> 00:26:44,167
Only the original
has that page, so...

383
00:26:44,298 --> 00:26:46,256
And page 751 contains the spells

384
00:26:46,387 --> 00:26:49,869
and incantations necessary
toopen and close said portal?

385
00:26:49,999 --> 00:26:52,741
Precisely.

386
00:26:52,872 --> 00:26:54,830
Why do you know that?

387
00:26:54,961 --> 00:26:56,702
We took a trip
to, uh, New England.

388
00:26:56,832 --> 00:26:58,921
To a small town called
Innsmouth, I believe.

389
00:26:59,052 --> 00:27:02,011
A seaside village.

390
00:27:02,142 --> 00:27:03,782
The trip seemed innocuousenough at first,

391
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:07,626
but I soon realized thatHenry
was up to something.

392
00:27:07,756 --> 00:27:09,149
You should go.

393
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,325
Fetch it now.

394
00:27:11,455 --> 00:27:12,455
Yes.

395
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:19,594
Who is going to feed him?

396
00:27:19,725 --> 00:27:21,422
He needs to grow.

397
00:27:21,552 --> 00:27:26,383
I'll Have your worthlessmother
do it while you're away.

398
00:27:26,514 --> 00:27:30,300
Give her a reason to
continue to breathe.

399
00:27:30,431 --> 00:27:33,782
There was a cult there,
that Henry was trying to stop.

400
00:27:33,913 --> 00:27:36,524
A cult attempting to opena
portal between our world

401
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,091
and the world of the old ones.

402
00:27:38,221 --> 00:27:40,833
It was a very complex
and detailed ritual.

403
00:27:40,963 --> 00:27:44,271
It was quite the big deal.

404
00:27:44,401 --> 00:27:48,797
Here, you see... first theyhad
to find a willing female...

405
00:27:48,928 --> 00:27:51,191
A woman to give
birth to these twins.

406
00:27:51,321 --> 00:27:52,864
One of the twins would
be human, the other

407
00:27:52,888 --> 00:27:54,542
would be an inhuman
manifestation

408
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:55,761
of the god Yog-Sothoth.

409
00:27:59,895 --> 00:28:02,245
[chanting]

410
00:28:18,827 --> 00:28:21,656
[chanting]

411
00:28:53,209 --> 00:28:55,342
It means for the twins,
10 years shall be 40.

412
00:28:55,472 --> 00:28:56,778
Yes.

413
00:28:56,909 --> 00:28:58,364
One of the cultists
was going on about how

414
00:28:58,388 --> 00:29:00,782
these twins would age rapidly.

415
00:29:00,913 --> 00:29:03,219
So if you run into
any40-year-olds with the intellect

416
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,613
of a child, you be careful.

417
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:06,527
Wilbur?

418
00:29:06,657 --> 00:29:09,835
Yes, Pa?

419
00:29:09,965 --> 00:29:11,227
We have many enemies.

420
00:29:14,143 --> 00:29:19,975
Mankind cannot
comprehendthe new world order.

421
00:29:20,106 --> 00:29:21,455
I know.

422
00:29:21,585 --> 00:29:24,327
When the planet
isliberated by the old ones,

423
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:28,418
only the true believerswill
prosper in the new age.

424
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:36,905
Mind your steps, boy.

425
00:29:37,036 --> 00:29:39,560
I'll find a way, Grandpa.

426
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,518
Or I'll make a way.

427
00:29:51,137 --> 00:29:54,357
Once this inhumanchild grows large enough,

428
00:29:54,488 --> 00:29:57,665
it holds open the portal for thelarger,
more powerful old ones

429
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,232
to enter our world.

430
00:29:59,362 --> 00:30:02,888
And thereby starting
the apocalypse.

431
00:30:03,018 --> 00:30:05,891
The original cult was lookingfor
the Necronomicon, as well.

432
00:30:06,021 --> 00:30:07,501
They were trying
to find a man named

433
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:11,244
Olas Wormius to help them.

434
00:30:11,374 --> 00:30:12,811
That's interesting.

435
00:30:12,941 --> 00:30:14,261
Henry set up an
appointment for me

436
00:30:14,377 --> 00:30:16,989
to meet with him
later this evening.

437
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:18,599
I tried to tell him
that the real Olas

438
00:30:18,729 --> 00:30:20,079
has been dead for
over 700 years,

439
00:30:20,209 --> 00:30:21,384
but he didn't believe me.

440
00:30:21,515 --> 00:30:22,927
It's also quite
convenient that he only

441
00:30:22,951 --> 00:30:24,910
lives four hours north of here.

442
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,956
But they're convinced
that he's legitimate.

443
00:30:28,087 --> 00:30:29,740
Those two areconvinced of quite a bit.

444
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:32,134
Indeed, they are.

445
00:30:32,265 --> 00:30:34,180
Do me a favor.

446
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,834
Be careful.

447
00:30:35,964 --> 00:30:38,401
These cultists,
they... takethis stuff very seriously.

448
00:30:38,532 --> 00:30:39,968
You're quite
cavalier with people,

449
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:43,232
if you don't mind me saying,
so just watch your step.

450
00:30:43,363 --> 00:30:44,668
I'll be careful.

451
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:49,108
Ah... can I borrow these?

452
00:30:49,238 --> 00:30:51,197
Well, they're part of
my private collection.

453
00:30:51,327 --> 00:30:52,696
[inaudible] I will
take care of them.

454
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,593
I'll guard them with my life.

455
00:30:56,724 --> 00:30:57,724
All right.

456
00:30:57,812 --> 00:30:59,858
Just be very careful with them.

457
00:30:59,988 --> 00:31:00,859
Thank you.

458
00:31:00,989 --> 00:31:02,251
- Lunch on Monday?
- Yes.

459
00:31:02,382 --> 00:31:03,382
Yes, yes.

460
00:31:07,169 --> 00:31:08,954
[footsteps]

461
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:24,665
Where is she, freak?

462
00:31:24,795 --> 00:31:27,494
Where is she?

463
00:31:27,624 --> 00:31:28,408
Who?

464
00:31:28,538 --> 00:31:30,192
Amanda!

465
00:31:30,323 --> 00:31:31,648
You were the only other
personthere when she disappeared,

466
00:31:31,672 --> 00:31:33,239
man.

467
00:31:33,369 --> 00:31:34,936
Where is she?

468
00:31:35,067 --> 00:31:36,067
Stop!

469
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:41,987
She's inside.

470
00:31:42,117 --> 00:31:43,466
I will take you to her.

471
00:31:59,613 --> 00:32:00,613
Brandy?

472
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:11,842
Oh, good!

473
00:32:11,973 --> 00:32:12,843
Company!

474
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:14,802
[laughter]

475
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:15,803
Shut up!

476
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,283
Shut up!

477
00:32:17,413 --> 00:32:19,241
[laughter]

478
00:32:20,982 --> 00:32:21,982
Shut up!

479
00:32:26,857 --> 00:32:29,208
[laughter]

480
00:32:31,645 --> 00:32:32,645
Upstairs.

481
00:32:36,737 --> 00:32:38,608
After you.

482
00:32:38,739 --> 00:32:41,307
The both of you!

483
00:32:41,437 --> 00:32:42,699
Now!

484
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:45,093
[laughter]

485
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:49,792
God!

486
00:32:54,189 --> 00:32:56,539
No!

487
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,019
[screaming]

488
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,542
Go upstairs, boy.

489
00:32:59,673 --> 00:33:01,501
She's waiting for you.

490
00:33:01,631 --> 00:33:02,981
What the...

491
00:33:03,111 --> 00:33:04,460
[screaming]

492
00:33:20,085 --> 00:33:21,085
You're late.

493
00:33:26,439 --> 00:33:27,309
I'm sorry.

494
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,182
I thought I was early.

495
00:33:30,312 --> 00:33:32,334
Well, when we were together,
you were never ready on time.

496
00:33:32,358 --> 00:33:34,447
You were usually a
minimumof 15 minutes late.

497
00:33:34,577 --> 00:33:36,231
So I gave you the
benefit of the doubt

498
00:33:36,362 --> 00:33:40,105
and showed up 10
minutes after we agreed.

499
00:33:40,235 --> 00:33:41,915
This is going to be
a long drive, isn't it?

500
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:44,733
I never said that.

501
00:34:47,563 --> 00:34:50,653
If you didn't,
why wouldit be burned into my memory?

502
00:34:50,784 --> 00:34:51,611
I don't know.

503
00:34:51,741 --> 00:34:53,439
Overactive imagination?

504
00:34:53,569 --> 00:34:55,919
Delusions?

505
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:57,182
You're brilliant, Fay.

506
00:34:57,312 --> 00:34:59,314
You're brilliant.

507
00:34:59,445 --> 00:35:02,143
Dr. Armitage is a
wonderful man, and I

508
00:35:02,274 --> 00:35:03,754
think he's a great
teacher, but you're

509
00:35:03,797 --> 00:35:04,624
following him into his cult.

510
00:35:04,754 --> 00:35:05,494
It's not a cult.

511
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:08,367
It's not?

512
00:35:08,497 --> 00:35:10,760
I thought you were
smarter than that.

513
00:35:10,891 --> 00:35:13,198
You haven't seen
what we've seen.

514
00:35:13,328 --> 00:35:15,008
You turned your back
on us before the truth

515
00:35:15,069 --> 00:35:16,766
could be revealed.

516
00:35:16,897 --> 00:35:17,897
The truth?

517
00:35:17,985 --> 00:35:20,509
It's mythology, Fay.

518
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,946
It's legends and storiesfrom
prehistoric dreamers

519
00:35:23,077 --> 00:35:24,209
and science fiction authors.

520
00:35:24,339 --> 00:35:25,751
It's not real.
- Believe what you want.

521
00:35:25,775 --> 00:35:26,559
It's not real.

522
00:35:26,689 --> 00:35:27,777
I know...

523
00:35:27,908 --> 00:35:29,344
I know what's out there.

524
00:35:29,475 --> 00:35:30,669
I know what we
must do, and I know

525
00:35:30,693 --> 00:35:31,912
the consequences if we fail!

526
00:35:35,437 --> 00:35:36,477
That's why we didn't work.

527
00:35:39,398 --> 00:35:41,835
You lost all
respect, because you

528
00:35:41,965 --> 00:35:43,125
think you're smarter than us.

529
00:35:52,889 --> 00:35:54,413
I just always found
your relationship

530
00:35:54,543 --> 00:35:55,762
with Dr. Armitage...

531
00:35:58,591 --> 00:35:59,591
Atypical.

532
00:36:02,812 --> 00:36:06,599
Do you think we slept together?

533
00:36:06,729 --> 00:36:07,729
Me and Henry?

534
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:21,570
WOMAN: Ah... uh-uh.

535
00:36:21,701 --> 00:36:25,966
I can't do it without you.

536
00:36:26,096 --> 00:36:29,970
Grandpa said you
would have to do it.

537
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,885
WOMAN: Ah... I'm...

538
00:36:32,015 --> 00:36:34,627
I've been here
since you were born.

539
00:36:34,757 --> 00:36:36,281
You can't leave
me here with him.

540
00:36:41,895 --> 00:36:43,810
I'm afraid!

541
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,768
There's nothing to be afraid of.

542
00:37:52,313 --> 00:37:54,359
This is it.

543
00:37:54,489 --> 00:37:55,489
This is where we start.

544
00:38:26,173 --> 00:38:27,522
[bell ringing]

545
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,969
Can I help y'all?

546
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,454
We're here to see Olas.

547
00:38:46,585 --> 00:38:47,847
Ah.

548
00:38:47,977 --> 00:38:49,675
No Olas here.

549
00:38:49,805 --> 00:38:54,244
I sell bait and crawfish,
when the season is right.

550
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:55,855
Armitage sent us.

551
00:38:55,985 --> 00:38:57,335
He gave me this to give to you.

552
00:39:01,817 --> 00:39:02,949
It's, uh...

553
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:05,952
I know what it is.

554
00:39:06,082 --> 00:39:09,738
The question is do
y'all know what it is?

555
00:39:09,869 --> 00:39:13,263
Where y'all asking to go?

556
00:39:13,394 --> 00:39:15,353
What y'all asking to see?

557
00:39:18,268 --> 00:39:20,053
We have a question for Olas.

558
00:39:20,183 --> 00:39:21,881
We need to speak to him.

559
00:39:22,011 --> 00:39:25,972
Olas answers allquestions with the truth.

560
00:39:26,102 --> 00:39:27,495
Look within.

561
00:39:27,626 --> 00:39:30,846
You'll find all the
answers you need.

562
00:39:30,977 --> 00:39:32,239
Please.

563
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,197
We've given you what
you need to take us.

564
00:39:38,158 --> 00:39:40,595
Out back there's a little boat.

565
00:39:40,726 --> 00:39:42,249
Take it.

566
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,860
Paddle upstream.

567
00:39:44,991 --> 00:39:47,559
North.

568
00:39:47,689 --> 00:39:48,864
How far north?

569
00:39:48,995 --> 00:39:49,995
You'll know.

570
00:39:53,913 --> 00:39:54,957
OK, great.

571
00:39:55,088 --> 00:39:57,307
Thank you.

572
00:39:57,438 --> 00:39:58,438
Thank you.

573
00:40:01,268 --> 00:40:02,268
Oh, Christ.

574
00:40:06,752 --> 00:40:10,886
I think that Yoda back
therewas a little over-dramatic.

575
00:40:11,017 --> 00:40:13,280
Well, you said yourself,
people believe in this.

576
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,586
They'll protect it.

577
00:40:14,716 --> 00:40:15,717
Try and scare us away.

578
00:40:19,852 --> 00:40:24,073
When I was six, I
stopped going to church.

579
00:40:24,204 --> 00:40:27,425
I told my mother that I was
sickof hearing about virgin births,

580
00:40:27,555 --> 00:40:30,428
and burning bushes,
and a godthat would condemn a good man

581
00:40:30,558 --> 00:40:32,168
who doesn't believe
while welcoming

582
00:40:32,299 --> 00:40:35,128
a mass murderer who repents.

583
00:40:35,258 --> 00:40:37,478
Some blind, Creole
crawfish peddler's

584
00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:40,438
not going to change my mind.

585
00:40:40,568 --> 00:40:44,746
Sometimes you have to
believein things you can't see.

586
00:40:44,877 --> 00:40:46,879
There are higher truths.

587
00:40:47,009 --> 00:40:49,664
Fay, as much as I love you,
you can't convince me, either.

588
00:40:59,935 --> 00:41:02,372
What?

589
00:41:02,503 --> 00:41:05,550
I don't think in the sixyears
that we were together,

590
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,422
you ever once said
that you loved me.

591
00:41:08,553 --> 00:41:09,553
Of course I did.

592
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:15,472
Didn't I?

593
00:41:19,912 --> 00:41:26,222
[suspenseful music playing]

594
00:43:27,648 --> 00:43:28,780
Dr. Rice.

595
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:30,172
Dr. Morgan.

596
00:43:30,303 --> 00:43:31,609
We have been expecting you.

597
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,634
Pick up.
Come on, pick it up.

598
00:43:59,506 --> 00:44:00,550
This is Henry.

599
00:44:00,681 --> 00:44:04,511
Now listen...
There's a connection

600
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:07,601
between the girl's
family from the exorcism

601
00:44:07,732 --> 00:44:10,648
and a Puritan era
cult near Dunwich.

602
00:44:10,778 --> 00:44:12,562
And the girl is a
direct descendant.

603
00:44:12,693 --> 00:44:15,000
She's coming down
here to meet with me,

604
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:16,305
so call me with an update...

605
00:44:19,569 --> 00:44:20,569
Can I help you?

606
00:44:23,486 --> 00:44:25,532
Dr. Rice?

607
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:26,751
No, I'm Dr. Armitage.

608
00:44:26,881 --> 00:44:27,621
Dr. Rice.

609
00:44:27,752 --> 00:44:28,970
Is away on business.

610
00:44:29,101 --> 00:44:31,930
Can I take a message?

611
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,975
Maybe you can help me.

612
00:44:34,106 --> 00:44:37,675
Dr. Rice is the curator
ofthe Antiquities Collection,

613
00:44:37,805 --> 00:44:39,198
is he not?

614
00:44:39,328 --> 00:44:40,808
Yes.

615
00:44:40,939 --> 00:44:44,943
I'm looking for a
book in his library.

616
00:44:45,073 --> 00:44:45,857
A book?

617
00:44:45,987 --> 00:44:49,295
Which book?

618
00:44:49,425 --> 00:44:50,992
I'll know it when I see it.

619
00:44:53,952 --> 00:44:58,086
Well... I'm not
really very familiar

620
00:44:58,217 --> 00:45:00,567
with the surroundings here.

621
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,700
Uh, books... book, book, book.

622
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:05,093
Would it be one of these?

623
00:45:05,224 --> 00:45:05,964
No?

624
00:45:06,094 --> 00:45:07,094
Uh...

625
00:45:07,182 --> 00:45:12,013
Uh... What's your name, friend?

626
00:45:12,144 --> 00:45:13,145
Whateley.

627
00:45:13,275 --> 00:45:14,275
Wilbur Whateley.

628
00:45:20,108 --> 00:45:20,892
Oh, yeah.

629
00:45:21,022 --> 00:45:22,371
OK.

630
00:45:22,502 --> 00:45:23,740
I think I might
know where they are.

631
00:45:23,764 --> 00:45:24,764
Why don't you follow me?

632
00:45:38,083 --> 00:45:39,127
Please enter.

633
00:45:46,656 --> 00:45:47,788
Sit.

634
00:45:47,919 --> 00:45:49,747
The master shall be here soon.

635
00:46:05,066 --> 00:46:07,373
I think we're wasting our time.

636
00:46:07,503 --> 00:46:08,503
Shh.

637
00:46:12,944 --> 00:46:15,816
The master OlasWormius will see you now.

638
00:46:15,947 --> 00:46:16,686
Oh.

639
00:46:16,817 --> 00:46:17,817
Good.

640
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:02,820
There are a great manybooks here,
Mr. Whateley.

641
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:07,085
It might help if you
could describe it to me.

642
00:47:07,215 --> 00:47:08,215
[sigh]

643
00:47:09,217 --> 00:47:11,002
[sniffling]

644
00:47:18,052 --> 00:47:26,052
[inaudible]

645
00:47:30,325 --> 00:47:31,674
[sniffing]

646
00:47:43,034 --> 00:47:44,034
There.

647
00:47:58,397 --> 00:47:59,572
You're not going to find it.

648
00:48:04,098 --> 00:48:05,099
That's a copy.

649
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:06,535
Like yours.

650
00:48:06,666 --> 00:48:14,666
There's no page 751.

651
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:22,160
Where is the original?

652
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:24,379
I don't have it.

653
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:28,253
It's you.
You opened the portal.

654
00:48:37,784 --> 00:48:39,177
What do you know of such things?

655
00:48:43,094 --> 00:48:45,879
You summoned Yog-Sothoth.

656
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:48,795
He holds the door
open for the others.

657
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:50,449
Yes.

658
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:51,579
It grows.

659
00:48:54,844 --> 00:48:59,762
Grows strong enough to
holdit open for the old ones.

660
00:48:59,893 --> 00:49:00,893
Where?

661
00:49:05,681 --> 00:49:06,813
Help me find the book.

662
00:49:10,817 --> 00:49:13,037
I'm like you.

663
00:49:13,167 --> 00:49:14,908
I'm a member of the brotherhood.

664
00:49:18,825 --> 00:49:22,437
Then... you will help me?

665
00:49:22,568 --> 00:49:23,568
Brother.

666
00:49:28,095 --> 00:49:29,792
Where is it?

667
00:49:29,923 --> 00:49:30,923
I will not tell you.

668
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,015
I will take you.

669
00:49:40,542 --> 00:49:42,457
[wheezing]

670
00:49:42,588 --> 00:49:43,415
Air.

671
00:49:43,545 --> 00:49:45,852
I need my air.

672
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:49,595
All my life you've been
telling me I'm no good.

673
00:49:49,725 --> 00:49:51,423
I can't do anything.

674
00:49:51,553 --> 00:49:52,990
I need my air.

675
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:55,993
Boy needs to be fed.

676
00:49:56,123 --> 00:49:57,951
Boy needs to be fed!

677
00:49:58,082 --> 00:49:59,997
I can't leave!

678
00:50:00,127 --> 00:50:02,303
Boy needs to be fed!

679
00:50:02,434 --> 00:50:04,349
What's wrong with you?

680
00:50:04,479 --> 00:50:07,047
Well, he's gonna get fed!

681
00:50:07,178 --> 00:50:08,701
What are you doing?

682
00:50:08,831 --> 00:50:10,268
What are you doing?

683
00:50:10,398 --> 00:50:12,835
Come and get it, boy!

684
00:50:12,966 --> 00:50:13,749
What?

685
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,751
Oh... no, no, no!

686
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:19,233
No!

687
00:50:19,364 --> 00:50:20,234
No!

688
00:50:20,365 --> 00:50:21,235
No!

689
00:50:21,366 --> 00:50:22,366
No!

690
00:50:25,805 --> 00:50:28,199
[shouting]

691
00:50:28,329 --> 00:50:30,157
[screaming]

692
00:50:31,811 --> 00:50:34,118
[roaring]

693
00:50:41,299 --> 00:50:43,605
[laughter]

694
00:50:52,701 --> 00:50:53,701
[sigh]

695
00:50:55,313 --> 00:50:56,313
Welcome.

696
00:51:00,274 --> 00:51:02,146
It's quite the entrance, sir.

697
00:51:02,276 --> 00:51:03,147
Olas.

698
00:51:03,277 --> 00:51:04,104
Dr. Armitage...

699
00:51:04,235 --> 00:51:06,976
I know why you are here.

700
00:51:07,107 --> 00:51:09,892
You seek the book.

701
00:51:10,023 --> 00:51:11,894
The book that is hidden.

702
00:51:12,025 --> 00:51:15,550
The book that should
never be found.

703
00:51:15,681 --> 00:51:18,771
[inaudible]

704
00:51:18,901 --> 00:51:19,901
That's right.

705
00:51:19,989 --> 00:51:21,556
With the old ones comes chaos.

706
00:51:24,864 --> 00:51:28,215
They are not of our world.

707
00:51:28,346 --> 00:51:33,090
They lie in sleep,
waiting to return.

708
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:36,354
To plunge mankind into madness.

709
00:51:41,968 --> 00:51:45,276
Someone has opened a portal.

710
00:51:45,406 --> 00:51:47,626
The old ones are attemptingto
come into this world.

711
00:51:47,756 --> 00:51:49,802
Now.

712
00:51:49,932 --> 00:51:51,934
We must stop them.

713
00:51:52,065 --> 00:51:54,154
I know.

714
00:51:54,285 --> 00:51:56,678
I have seen them.

715
00:51:56,809 --> 00:51:57,636
Cthulhu.

716
00:51:57,766 --> 00:52:00,987
Speaks to me in dreams.

717
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:04,643
Warns me of the
impending apocalypse.

718
00:52:04,773 --> 00:52:06,253
Begging me to unfree him.

719
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:11,246
Did he happen to mentionwhere
we might find the book?

720
00:52:17,003 --> 00:52:20,876
For centuries the book
was in my possession.

721
00:52:21,007 --> 00:52:24,010
It was stolen from me by
the Black Brotherhood.

722
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:28,536
Later it fell into
the hands of a witch.

723
00:52:28,667 --> 00:52:31,844
A witch who escaped
persecutionduring the Salem Witch Trials.

724
00:52:34,542 --> 00:52:38,590
That witch's descendant...
a man came Ward...

725
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,852
Now holds the book.

726
00:52:50,993 --> 00:52:52,125
100 Prospect Road.

727
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:01,961
Do you have a zip code for that?

728
00:53:02,091 --> 00:53:05,573
So I can type it
into my MapQuest?

729
00:53:05,704 --> 00:53:06,531
No, never mind.

730
00:53:06,661 --> 00:53:07,967
I'm sorry.

731
00:53:08,097 --> 00:53:09,097
Can we go?

732
00:53:11,971 --> 00:53:12,971
Thank you.

733
00:53:17,803 --> 00:53:20,893
The house is not
what you expect.

734
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:22,242
I'm not surprised.

735
00:53:22,373 --> 00:53:23,765
Thank you.

736
00:53:23,896 --> 00:53:26,855
You do not believe, Dr. Rice.

737
00:53:31,033 --> 00:53:33,862
No.

738
00:53:33,993 --> 00:53:36,343
Good.

739
00:53:36,474 --> 00:53:38,084
Remember that when
you are inside.

740
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:44,351
[laughter]

741
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:09,028
I can't believe you
were unaffected by that.

742
00:54:09,158 --> 00:54:12,597
I can't believe that you were.

743
00:54:12,727 --> 00:54:15,687
I've seen much better
acts on the Vegas strip.

744
00:54:15,817 --> 00:54:18,385
The man levitated into the room.

745
00:54:18,516 --> 00:54:20,909
That's called a parlor trick.

746
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,520
You know, using
rational thought, Fay,

747
00:54:22,563 --> 00:54:24,478
you can explain the most
extraordinary things.

748
00:54:28,482 --> 00:54:30,745
You're very cold.

749
00:54:30,876 --> 00:54:33,139
I'm very practical.

750
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:36,055
Very practical.

751
00:54:36,185 --> 00:54:38,057
Do you have faith in anything?

752
00:54:38,187 --> 00:54:39,187
Yes.

753
00:54:47,849 --> 00:54:50,243
Nothing from Armitage.

754
00:54:50,374 --> 00:54:52,245
I hope he's made some progress.

755
00:54:52,376 --> 00:54:54,247
I hope we make some progress.

756
00:54:54,378 --> 00:54:55,770
I have this strange
feeling we're

757
00:54:55,901 --> 00:54:57,748
going to run into anotheridiot
speaking gibberish

758
00:54:57,772 --> 00:54:58,904
with grave seriousness.

759
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,834
What?

760
00:55:15,964 --> 00:55:18,750
What time do you have?

761
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:19,751
I don't.

762
00:55:19,881 --> 00:55:20,881
It stopped.

763
00:55:23,494 --> 00:55:24,494
Mine, too.

764
00:55:40,685 --> 00:55:41,685
He is here.

765
00:55:45,516 --> 00:55:48,867
Yog-Sothoth knows the gate.

766
00:55:48,997 --> 00:55:51,609
Yog-Sothoth is the gate.

767
00:55:51,739 --> 00:55:56,309
Yog-Sothoth is the
keyand guardian of the gate.

768
00:55:56,440 --> 00:56:00,400
Past, present, and future.

769
00:56:00,531 --> 00:56:06,928
All are one in Yog-Sothoth.

770
00:56:07,059 --> 00:56:11,890
He knows where the
oldone broke through a void.

771
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:15,328
And there they will
break through again.

772
00:56:44,226 --> 00:56:46,011
This one looks rather inviting.

773
00:56:46,141 --> 00:56:49,754
It's charming, really.

774
00:56:49,884 --> 00:56:50,884
Don't bet on it.

775
00:56:53,105 --> 00:56:54,105
Shall we?

776
00:57:47,594 --> 00:57:48,594
Hello?

777
00:58:00,433 --> 00:58:01,433
OK, let's split up.

778
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:02,653
You should take upstairs.

779
00:58:02,783 --> 00:58:03,567
No.

780
00:58:03,697 --> 00:58:04,872
We should stay together.

781
00:58:05,003 --> 00:58:06,961
OK.

782
00:58:07,092 --> 00:58:09,747
What did he say to you,
right before we left?

783
00:58:09,877 --> 00:58:14,665
He said that it was
goodthat I didn't believe.

784
00:58:14,795 --> 00:58:17,494
I wonder what he meant by that?

785
00:58:17,624 --> 00:58:18,451
Nothing.

786
00:58:18,582 --> 00:58:20,018
He meant nothing.

787
00:58:20,148 --> 00:58:22,237
It was actually meant tobe
more spooky mumbo jumbo.

788
00:58:34,598 --> 00:58:36,425
Well, we're wasting
a lot of time.

789
00:58:40,299 --> 00:58:42,780
Old relics are found
buriedin caves and dig sites,

790
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:46,392
not sitting in an empty
old bed and breakfast.

791
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:47,872
It's not what we expect.

792
00:58:57,577 --> 00:58:58,577
Oh?

793
00:59:01,494 --> 00:59:02,494
Mr. Ward?

794
00:59:43,318 --> 00:59:44,624
[shouting]

795
00:59:54,286 --> 00:59:56,526
Well, that's going to takeme
a little longer to explain.

796
01:00:10,563 --> 01:00:11,912
Who this?

797
01:00:12,043 --> 01:00:15,307
He's here to help us.

798
01:00:15,437 --> 01:00:16,482
I like him.

799
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:17,613
Quiet, Mother.

800
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:27,406
What... happened to Grandpa?

801
01:00:27,536 --> 01:00:30,931
He, um... he, um...

802
01:00:31,062 --> 01:00:32,933
He gave himself to
feed your brother.

803
01:00:36,589 --> 01:00:38,852
He would not do that.

804
01:00:38,983 --> 01:00:39,983
He... he... he did.

805
01:00:43,378 --> 01:00:45,729
That was not the plan.

806
01:00:45,859 --> 01:00:47,252
He... he changed the plan.

807
01:00:47,382 --> 01:00:50,690
He said you'd understand.

808
01:00:50,821 --> 01:00:51,691
You...

809
01:00:51,822 --> 01:00:53,693
I didn't have a choice.

810
01:00:53,824 --> 01:00:57,175
I can't leave.

811
01:00:57,305 --> 01:00:59,656
How dare you?

812
01:00:59,786 --> 01:01:01,179
He was gonna kill me, Wilbur.

813
01:01:01,309 --> 01:01:03,137
He was gonna kill your mama!

814
01:01:03,268 --> 01:01:04,661
[shouting]

815
01:01:17,108 --> 01:01:18,508
We've already gone
up three flights.

816
01:01:21,112 --> 01:01:22,112
I know.

817
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:27,727
I swear this house only
hadtwo stories when we came in.

818
01:01:39,521 --> 01:01:42,699
Look at this hallway.

819
01:01:42,829 --> 01:01:43,829
It goes on forever.

820
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:54,100
I see a light.

821
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:11,945
I don't need you.

822
01:02:12,076 --> 01:02:15,209
You will be next.

The author of the Necronomicon.

826
01:03:28,369 --> 01:03:29,369
Remarkable.

827
01:03:40,338 --> 01:03:41,339
Come here.

828
01:03:41,469 --> 01:03:42,469
Help me.

829
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,908
The door's not there anymore.

830
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:31,911
We're trapped.

Oh, I'm so sorry.

842
01:05:18,697 --> 01:05:20,525
I didn't mean it, Wilbur.

It's OK.

I shouldn't have left you.

Wait, wait, we never
left the bayou.

01:08:08,475 --> 01:08:09,607
It's not real.
Focus.

01:08:14,655 --> 01:08:15,439

01:08:15,569 --> 01:08:17,136
OK.

01:08:17,267 --> 01:08:18,485
It's not real.

875
01:08:18,616 --> 01:08:22,185
So why are we still here?

876
01:08:22,315 --> 01:08:25,144
He said that the old onesspeak
to him in dreams, right?

877
01:08:25,275 --> 01:08:26,058
Right.

878
01:08:26,189 --> 01:08:26,928
Right.

879
01:08:27,059 --> 01:08:28,104
Right.

880
01:08:28,234 --> 01:08:30,454
We're in a dream.

881
01:08:30,584 --> 01:08:32,369
The book is hidden
in this house.

882
01:08:32,499 --> 01:08:33,805
What?

883
01:08:33,935 --> 01:08:36,329
We can't just make it
appear in front of us.

884
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:37,460
No.

885
01:08:40,246 --> 01:08:41,484
We can't take the
book from the dream.

886
01:08:41,508 --> 01:08:42,292
The book doesn't exist.

887
01:08:42,422 --> 01:08:43,902
It never did.

888
01:08:44,032 --> 01:08:45,392
That's why there
isn't an original.

889
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:51,518
The house is the book.

890
01:08:51,649 --> 01:08:53,041
The house is the book.

891
01:08:53,172 --> 01:08:54,172

now do you believe?

We're on our way to you.

911
01:10:57,427 --> 01:10:59,298
Are you still at the university?

912
01:10:59,429 --> 01:11:02,606
It's... it's worse
than we expected.

913
01:11:02,736 --> 01:11:04,869
I'm going to try and
dosomething to slow it down.

914
01:11:04,999 --> 01:11:05,783
I'm still here.

915
01:11:05,913 --> 01:11:07,350
I'll wait for you.

916
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:08,960
Right.

01:11:09,090 --> 01:11:12,006

01:12:18,421 --> 01:12:19,596
He said he would be here.

925
01:12:19,726 --> 01:12:20,510
Call him.

926
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,555
Find out where he went.

927
01:12:22,686 --> 01:12:23,469
Ah!

928
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,341
Straight to voicemail.

929
01:12:25,471 --> 01:12:26,777
Hello?

930
01:12:26,907 --> 01:12:27,734
Caitlin?

931
01:12:27,865 --> 01:12:28,735
What are you doing here?

932
01:12:28,866 --> 01:12:30,476
Dr. Armitage called me.

933
01:12:30,607 --> 01:12:32,847
He said he had some
questionsabout my great grandfather.

934
01:12:35,394 --> 01:12:36,700
What's your last name?

935
01:12:36,830 --> 01:12:37,830
Bowers.

936
01:12:54,805 --> 01:12:56,589
[roaring]

937
01:13:02,726 --> 01:13:05,032
[roaring]

938
01:13:06,686 --> 01:13:08,993
[shouting]

939
01:13:12,083 --> 01:13:13,476
This makes no sense.

940
01:13:13,606 --> 01:13:15,608
I mean, it's not
like him to do this.

941
01:13:15,739 --> 01:13:17,088
Something is amiss.

942
01:13:17,218 --> 01:13:19,438
He fully intended to be here.

943
01:13:19,569 --> 01:13:22,354
Someone or something
drew him from here.

944
01:13:22,485 --> 01:13:23,311
Yeah, but where?

945
01:13:23,442 --> 01:13:24,442
I don't know.

946
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:34,366
Amelia?

947
01:13:34,497 --> 01:13:36,542
Can you bring me the
security log, please?

948
01:13:39,371 --> 01:13:42,940
Anyone after hours,
anybodywho listed me as a contact.

949
01:13:43,070 --> 01:13:44,681
Uh, just one.

950
01:13:44,811 --> 01:13:45,551
A Whateley?

951
01:13:45,682 --> 01:13:47,248
Whateley.

952
01:13:47,379 --> 01:13:55,379
[whispering] Does the
nameWhateley mean anything to you?

953
01:13:57,128 --> 01:13:58,172
No.

954
01:13:58,303 --> 01:13:59,347
Should it?

955
01:13:59,478 --> 01:14:01,045
This is a list of the occultists

956
01:14:01,175 --> 01:14:03,656
and the families tied to
theold ones over the centuries.

957
01:14:03,787 --> 01:14:05,876
So a Mr. Whateley
came to the office

958
01:14:06,006 --> 01:14:08,182
last week to visit Dr. Armitage?

959
01:14:08,313 --> 01:14:09,053
No.

960
01:14:09,183 --> 01:14:11,490
He came here to see me.

961
01:14:11,621 --> 01:14:12,621
To get this.

962
01:14:16,016 --> 01:14:17,453
Grab your things.

963
01:14:17,583 --> 01:14:18,583
Let's go.

964
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:23,328
Directions.

965
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:24,198
Wow.

966
01:14:24,329 --> 01:14:26,287
He's good.

967
01:14:26,418 --> 01:14:27,201
Yeah.

968
01:14:27,332 --> 01:14:28,332
He is.

969
01:14:47,657 --> 01:14:50,007
[creature growling]

970
01:15:00,626 --> 01:15:02,933
[rattling]

971
01:15:09,156 --> 01:15:10,676
I need you to drive
while I study this.

972
01:15:10,767 --> 01:15:11,767
You got it.

973
01:15:14,858 --> 01:15:16,773
What is she doing here?

974
01:15:16,903 --> 01:15:18,533
Well,
the old ones speakthrough family lineage.

975
01:15:18,557 --> 01:15:19,665
They spoke through
her grandfather,

976
01:15:19,689 --> 01:15:20,929
and now they speak through her.

977
01:15:21,038 --> 01:15:21,865
Yeah.

978
01:15:21,995 --> 01:15:23,519
And it could be useful.

979
01:15:23,649 --> 01:15:26,522
Are you sure you
want to do this?

980
01:15:26,652 --> 01:15:28,132
24 hours ago I
was convinced this

981
01:15:28,262 --> 01:15:30,221
was all a big heaping pile of...

982
01:15:30,351 --> 01:15:31,352
Nonsense.

983
01:15:31,483 --> 01:15:33,224
I felt that way 24 hours ago.

984
01:15:33,354 --> 01:15:34,486
So?

985
01:15:34,617 --> 01:15:35,617
So?

986
01:15:37,663 --> 01:15:40,318
I've seen things
that I can't explain.

987
01:15:40,448 --> 01:15:43,277
I've experienced things
faroutside the realm of normal,

988
01:15:43,408 --> 01:15:45,149
and if any of it is
true, or even if it's

989
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:47,847
partly true, what we're
about to experience

990
01:15:47,978 --> 01:15:49,719
is not for the squeamish.

991
01:15:49,849 --> 01:15:52,156
Dr. Rice, I was possessed.

992
01:15:52,286 --> 01:15:54,985
Now, I don't remember much ofit,
but from what they told me,

993
01:15:55,115 --> 01:15:57,248
I had bat wings
growing out of my back.

994
01:15:57,378 --> 01:15:59,816
So I'm down.

995
01:15:59,946 --> 01:16:02,340
Fine.

996
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:03,470
I've got shotgun.

997
01:16:30,194 --> 01:16:32,979
You remember anything, Caitlin?

998
01:16:33,110 --> 01:16:34,502
Not a lot.

999
01:16:34,633 --> 01:16:36,809
I mean... I rememberthings
before it happened.

1000
01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:37,940
Such as?

1001
01:16:41,205 --> 01:16:43,729
CAITLIN [VOICEOVER]: Well,
I started sleepwalking.

1002
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:46,819
I would walk outside,
into the yard.

1003
01:16:46,950 --> 01:16:48,560
I drew things on the ground.

1004
01:16:48,691 --> 01:16:50,431
Circles.

1005
01:16:50,562 --> 01:16:51,955
Circles with symbols.

1006
01:16:52,085 --> 01:16:54,653
The... the symbols
alwayspointed towards the east.

1007
01:16:54,784 --> 01:16:56,960
And I remember the night
before it happened,

1008
01:16:57,090 --> 01:16:59,615
I made circles in myfront yard,
and something

1009
01:16:59,745 --> 01:17:07,745
happened that never
happened before And I

1010
01:17:33,953 --> 01:17:36,129
remember a poem... a song.

1011
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:38,958
Yom sureth, yom
azereth, yom belereth.

1012
01:17:39,089 --> 01:17:40,849
Yom turkis, yom derth. OK,
that's enough of that.

1013
01:17:40,873 --> 01:17:41,873
But remember that.

1014
01:17:41,918 --> 01:17:42,982
The poem is an incantation.

1015
01:17:43,006 --> 01:17:46,226
We're going to need it.

1016
01:17:46,357 --> 01:17:49,534
It says there's a road0.2
miles up on our left.

1017
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:54,234
But... I don't see it anywhere.

1018
01:17:54,365 --> 01:17:55,192
MapQuest is never wrong.

1019
01:17:55,322 --> 01:17:57,324
Maybe it's a private road?

1020
01:17:57,455 --> 01:17:58,455
There!

1021
01:18:23,524 --> 01:18:24,395
[shouting]

1022
01:18:24,525 --> 01:18:27,354
Doctor!

1023
01:18:27,485 --> 01:18:28,878
Henry!

1024
01:18:29,008 --> 01:18:30,314
Henry!
Henry!

1025
01:18:30,444 --> 01:18:31,315
I saw it.

1026
01:18:31,445 --> 01:18:32,229
Henry!

1027
01:18:32,359 --> 01:18:33,359
I saw its face.

1028
01:18:33,447 --> 01:18:34,448
Can you hear me?

1029
01:18:34,579 --> 01:18:35,699
- It looked at me.
- It's OK.

1030
01:18:35,798 --> 01:18:37,190
It's... No, it was inside my head!

1031
01:18:37,321 --> 01:18:38,409
We're here.

1032
01:18:38,539 --> 01:18:39,802
It showed me everything.

1033
01:18:39,932 --> 01:18:41,238
He's in shock.

1034
01:18:41,368 --> 01:18:42,368
[coughing]

1035
01:18:43,893 --> 01:18:45,198
I know.

1036
01:18:45,329 --> 01:18:47,157
Oh, god, I know.

1037
01:18:47,287 --> 01:18:48,462
Come on, Henry.

1038
01:18:48,593 --> 01:18:50,113
Let's stand up.
Caitlin, get a blanket.

1039
01:19:09,092 --> 01:19:10,092
Henry?

1040
01:19:12,530 --> 01:19:13,530
Henry.

1041
01:19:18,405 --> 01:19:21,278
Where did it go?

1042
01:19:21,408 --> 01:19:22,583
Oh, it's gone.

1043
01:19:22,714 --> 01:19:24,672
To the world.

1044
01:19:24,803 --> 01:19:25,803
What is it?

1045
01:19:31,070 --> 01:19:33,377
I can't say.

1046
01:19:33,507 --> 01:19:36,989
I can't speak its name.

1047
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:39,644
When you first
came to me, you said

1048
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:40,975
that a portal had been opened.

1049
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:45,389
Yes.

1050
01:19:45,519 --> 01:19:46,564
The guardian.

1051
01:19:46,694 --> 01:19:48,131
The gate keeper is Yog-Sothoth?

1052
01:19:52,744 --> 01:19:53,744
Is that who you saw?

1053
01:20:08,586 --> 01:20:14,287
Yog-Sothoth controls and
holdsopen the gates for the others.

1054
01:20:14,418 --> 01:20:16,072
He has to grow until
he's large enough

1055
01:20:16,202 --> 01:20:18,602
to hold open the gates for
eventhe greatest of the old ones.

1056
01:20:18,726 --> 01:20:19,727
Did you see that ceiling?

1057
01:20:19,858 --> 01:20:21,773
I mean, it looks pretty big.

1058
01:20:21,904 --> 01:20:23,296
No.

1059
01:20:23,427 --> 01:20:26,386
You're not getting it.

1060
01:20:26,517 --> 01:20:29,781
He can't open the portal.

1061
01:20:29,912 --> 01:20:31,827
Someone from our
world has to open it.

1062
01:20:34,786 --> 01:20:37,006
That's why Whateley
wanted the book.

1063
01:20:37,136 --> 01:20:38,964
He was going to open the portal.

1064
01:20:39,095 --> 01:20:42,576
So the question
is where did he go?

1065
01:20:42,707 --> 01:20:45,797
Well, maybe he went home?

1066
01:20:45,928 --> 01:20:47,451
He can't.

1067
01:20:47,581 --> 01:20:49,757
The woman said it...

1068
01:20:49,888 --> 01:20:52,108
Was Wilbur's brother.

1069
01:20:52,238 --> 01:20:54,980
Her son.

1070
01:20:55,111 --> 01:20:56,286
He can't go home.

1071
01:20:56,416 --> 01:20:57,416
He is home.

1072
01:21:00,812 --> 01:21:02,118
[thunder]

1073
01:21:22,529 --> 01:21:23,400
No.

1074
01:21:23,530 --> 01:21:24,530
Now it's home.

1075
01:21:46,858 --> 01:21:48,053
We're going to open the portal.

1076
01:21:48,077 --> 01:21:49,382
What?

1077
01:21:49,513 --> 01:21:50,882
Just long enough for
it to take its position.

1078
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:52,211
Try and hold it open.

1079
01:21:52,342 --> 01:21:53,778
Walter, if we open the portal...

1080
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:55,562
I know what the book says.

1081
01:21:55,693 --> 01:21:57,976
That's why we have to close
itbefore anything else comes out.

1082
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,653
If we open the portal, then...

1083
01:21:59,784 --> 01:22:01,718
Then the older,
stronger godsare gonna come into our world.

1084
01:22:01,742 --> 01:22:04,484
We'll be powerless.

1085
01:22:04,615 --> 01:22:06,617
I was wrong not to believe you.

1086
01:22:06,747 --> 01:22:08,880
I should have trusted
youand Henry this entire time.

1087
01:22:09,011 --> 01:22:10,751
I was arrogant, and jealous.

1088
01:22:10,882 --> 01:22:12,773
And I don't know what else,
but it blinded me to something

1089
01:22:12,797 --> 01:22:13,624
that I always knew was true.

1090
01:22:13,754 --> 01:22:15,931
Now I'm asking you...

1091
01:22:16,061 --> 01:22:16,932
Believe me.

1092
01:22:17,062 --> 01:22:18,062
We can do this.

1093
01:22:20,587 --> 01:22:22,372
How?

1094
01:22:22,502 --> 01:22:24,896
Henry isn't strong
enough to fight.

1095
01:22:25,027 --> 01:22:27,116
I mean... he knows
the ins and outs.

1096
01:22:27,246 --> 01:22:28,030
The incantations.

1097
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:29,553
He has experience.

1098
01:22:29,683 --> 01:22:33,122
And I've spent my
entirelife alone in a library,

1099
01:22:33,252 --> 01:22:34,273
obsessed with their books.

1100
01:22:34,297 --> 01:22:35,167
I know them, too.

1101
01:22:35,298 --> 01:22:37,169
I know they can be defeated.

1102
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:39,389
He's right.

1103
01:22:39,519 --> 01:22:40,519
We have to try.

1104
01:22:46,831 --> 01:22:47,963
Caitlin!

1105
01:22:48,093 --> 01:22:50,052
Do you remember those
circle drawings?

1106
01:22:50,182 --> 01:22:51,705
- Yeah.
- Good.

1107
01:22:51,836 --> 01:22:53,446
As soon as we get
outside, I need

1108
01:22:53,577 --> 01:22:55,163
you to make one large
enoughfor all four of us to stand in.

1109
01:22:55,187 --> 01:22:57,624
As long as we're in thecircle,
we should be safe.

1110
01:23:00,714 --> 01:23:02,542
[warbling]

1111
01:23:20,908 --> 01:23:22,736
Yog-Sothoth!

1112
01:23:22,867 --> 01:23:27,263
Yog-Sothoth, tu ra nan.

1113
01:23:27,393 --> 01:23:29,134
Yog-Sothoth, tu ra nan!

1114
01:23:33,269 --> 01:23:34,269
Yog-Sothoth!

[roaring]

1116
01:23:43,714 --> 01:23:45,063
Help me!
Help me!

1117
01:23:45,194 --> 01:23:46,194
Don't let it take me!

1118
01:23:46,238 --> 01:23:47,065
I'm not gonna let it take you!

1119
01:23:47,196 --> 01:23:49,111
Don't let it take me!

1120
01:23:49,241 --> 01:23:50,025
Help me!

1121
01:23:50,155 --> 01:23:51,243
Help me!

1122
01:23:51,374 --> 01:23:52,723
Don't let go!

1123
01:24:00,861 --> 01:24:01,861
Dad!

1124
01:24:14,092 --> 01:24:15,441
[chanting]

1125
01:24:21,012 --> 01:24:22,840
[roaring]

1126
01:24:27,801 --> 01:24:29,020
[chanting]

1127
01:24:33,981 --> 01:24:36,114
Now...

1128
01:24:36,245 --> 01:24:37,811
[chanting]

1129
01:24:42,164 --> 01:24:43,252
[chanting]

1130
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:07,667
Fay?

1131
01:25:07,798 --> 01:25:10,148
[shouting]

1132
01:25:16,241 --> 01:25:17,764
[chanting]

1133
01:25:17,895 --> 01:25:21,028
Don't let go, Fay.

1134
01:25:21,159 --> 01:25:22,987
[chanting]

1135
01:25:24,031 --> 01:25:25,031

1136
01:25:25,946 --> 01:25:27,122

1137
01:25:30,299 --> 01:25:31,604

1138

[creature roaring]

1139
01:26:08,206 --> 01:26:09,206
Oh, god.

1140
01:26:35,625 --> 01:26:36,495
Excuse me?

1141
01:26:36,626 --> 01:26:39,281
Professor?

1142
01:26:39,411 --> 01:26:41,674
I was wondering if I
couldschedule some time with you

1143
01:26:41,805 --> 01:26:44,634
during your office hours?

1144
01:26:44,764 --> 01:26:50,509
Actually,
my office hoursare all booked up this week.

1145
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:52,424
Dinner tonight, perhaps?

1146
01:26:52,555 --> 01:26:54,644
Oh... I don't know.

1147
01:26:54,774 --> 01:26:56,907
It hardly seems professional.

1148
01:26:57,037 --> 01:26:59,431
No, I guess it's
not very professional.

1149
01:26:59,562 --> 01:27:00,998
7:00?

1150
01:27:01,128 --> 01:27:05,350
Hm... Perfect.

1151
01:27:05,481 --> 01:27:06,481
I'll see you at 7:15.

1152
01:27:21,410 --> 01:27:24,935
Today we're going
todiscuss the concept of faith.

1153
01:27:27,677 --> 01:27:31,985
Faith is a belief
in power or powers

1154
01:27:32,116 --> 01:27:34,379
that can actually
alter human destiny.

1155
01:27:37,774 --> 01:27:39,036
What?

1156
01:27:39,166 --> 01:27:42,169
Dr. Rice, do you
believe in such a power?

1157
01:27:46,739 --> 01:27:47,914
Yes.

1158
01:27:48,045 --> 01:27:49,045
Yes, I do.
