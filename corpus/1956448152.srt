What am I going through?

1041
01:12:27,952 --> 01:12:29,616
Because I lost
my parents, too.

1042
01:12:29,618 --> 01:12:31,583

- Yes, yes, yes...

I'm talking about.

about my family...

1047
01:12:37,219 --> 01:12:38,450
I lost my parents
when I was a little boy.

1048

They burned up in a fire.

1049

about that. (SNIFFLES)

My parents,
they burned up in a fire

1051
01:12:44,552 --> 01:12:46,851
and I became,
technically, an orphan.

1052
01:12:46,853 --> 01:12:49,751
So believe me when I tell you
that I know what it's like.

1053

Because I do,
I really, really do.

1054
01:12:54,886 --> 01:12:58,551
Yet my difference is, I never
got the chance to feel lost,

1055
01:12:58,553 --> 01:13:02,585
because I had a family here.

1056
01:13:02,587 --> 01:13:06,887
Where everyone embraced me.
And swept me up.

1057
01:13:08,154 --> 01:13:10,320
And I was raised by
a community that doesn't

1058
01:13:10,322 --> 01:13:14,021
bicker over what's theirs
and what's not theirs.

1060
