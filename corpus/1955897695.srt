1
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:03,145
You know what your problem is?
You don't know what you want!

2
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:06,750
And if you had it,
you wouldn't know it!

3
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:10,388
If you had what I wanted,
I'd know what to do with it!

4
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:15,263
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

5
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:20,439
That's it!
You've gone too far this time!

6
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,498
Where's my goddamn gun?

7
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:31,047
We were never right
for each other!

8
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,528
You've probably been
saving yourself...

9
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:36,750
for all those babes
you got stashed somewhere.

10
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:40,692
Doris, number one, there is
no other woman in my life...

11
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,252
and number two, if there was...

12
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:45,697
she'd know I was livin'
with someone who I loved!

13
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,200
Or used to love.

14
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:52,162
Well, it's a good thing
we never got married!

15
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:53,764
Oh, you're damn right!

16
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:56,070
After the honeymoon,
I'd feel like a new man.

17
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,474
And so would you.

18
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,639
- Ohh!
- Where's my damn hat?

19
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,741
- Harry!
- What?

20
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:06,548
Not even a good-bye kiss?

21
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,365
Oh, answer it, Harry.

22
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,727
<i>I'm twin' .</i>

23
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,635
It might be important.

24
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,469
- Yeah?
- Is this the Dobbs agency?

25
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:27,632
Yeah, this is Harry Dobbs.

26
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,403
Would you handle a situation
for me?

27
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:30,841
Yeah, sure,
I could be available.

28
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,778
- Who is it?
- It's about a case. Uh-huh?

29
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:35,281
Do you know
where the Blue Danube is?

30
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:40,481
Oh, uh-huh. Mm-hmm!
Yeah, I... I got that address.

31
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,215
Mm-hmm. I could meet you there.

32
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:43,654
What do you look like?

33
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,216
Me? I'm regular build,
regular height.

34
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,227
It's a woman, isn't it?

35
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:50,355
How much do you charge,
Mr. Dobbs?

36
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:53,559
Well, we have
a standard retainer of $500...

37
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,501
and I will need that
in cash or cashier's check.

38
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:58,698
You son of a bitch!

39
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,638
Jesus!

40
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,698
What was that?
Was that a gunshot?

41
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,905
No, that was a car outside. Yes.

42
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:09,074
Tell her you love me.
Go on, tell her.

43
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:12,016
- My name is Miss Dolan.
- Right, right.

44
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:15,385
All right, I'll meet you there
at that time, Miss Dolan.

45
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,788
Yes, ma'am. Thank you.

46
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:20,418
What is the matter with you?
I could've lost that interview!

47
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,554
Miss Dolan?

48
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:26,060
Get out!

49
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,831
Go prowl around somewhere else!
I never want to see you again!

50
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,963
- Will you shut up in there?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

51
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,939
- What's the matter with you?
- And you, too.

52
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:20,811
Mademoiselle Dolan.

53
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:49,081
Manhattan in a champagne glass.

54
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,310
Bien, madame.

55
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,023
So...

56
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,121
what's on your mind, Miss Dolan?

57
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:05,574
Nothing like this
has ever happened...

58
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:07,191
to me before, Mr. Dobbs.

59
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,327
Harry. Nothing like what?

60
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,303
I need you to follow a man.

61
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:12,937
He can't know
that you're doing it, or...

62
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:18,305
Don't worry. He'll never know.

63
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:28,778
I could be put
in serious jeopardy.

64
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,789
Why do you want me
to follow this guy?

65
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:32,416
I can't tell you that.

66
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,620
Please...

67
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:38,594
they say you can be trusted.

68
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,598
Who says I can be trusted?

69
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:45,798
I saw it in a phone book
in the train station.

70
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:49,206
Please, Mr. Dobbs.
We haven't much time.

71
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,212
I'll pay you $2,000
plus expenses...

72
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,976
to follow Rick for one month.

73
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:01,215
He's coming
to this restaurant tonight.

74
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,217
Cozy-

75
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,455
He'll be here at 9:00.

76
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:17,561
Until you learn the meaning.

77
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,664
Of the blues.

78
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,070
Please say yes.

79
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,384
I'm staying
at the Hotel St. Simone.

80
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:36,181
I want to know who she is.

81
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,122
She?

82
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:39,318
Uh-huh.

83
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:42,384
It's very difficult for me
living in another place...

84
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,760
wondering when it's my turn.

85
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:49,132
Shortens one's life.
Makes one feel unlucky.

86
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:50,761
And that's not for me.

87
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,703
I've always been a lucky person.

88
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:03,712
He's six feet tall
and has sandy hair.

89
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:06,946
He wears glasses
and dresses smartly.

90
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,148
He also smells nice.

91
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:11,748
Well, that's a relief.

92
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:16,524
He may appear very charming,
but believe me, he's dangerous.

93
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,380
I'll need his name...

94
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:37,883
address...

95
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:42,813
type of car, and tag numbers,
if you got 'em.

96
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,345
What do you mean, dangerous?

97
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,187
This operative began
surveillance on February 14.

98
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:25,452
Subject known as Rick...

99
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,391
was seen leaving
the Blue Danube nightclub...

100
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:28,985
accompanied by
a female companion.

101
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:55,210
Rick, I've never been
to this place before.

102
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:07,963
Tag number... 475T3W.

103
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,356
Come to bed.

104
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,254
They gotta be married.

105
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:23,066
- St. Simone Hotel.
- Miss Dolan's <i>room,</i> please.

106
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,237
I'm sorry, Miss Dolan's not in.

107
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,769
- You're sure?
- Yes. Any message, sir?

108
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:30,145
No, no. No messages. Thank you.

109
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,386
Excuse me, sir.

110
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,448
You know,
I saw this blond-haired guy...

111
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,961
leaving here with his wife,
and he sure looks like...

112
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:43,872
this guy I was in the army with,
but I can't tell.

113
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:46,729
His hair's longer, and
I don't remember his last name.

114
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,825
You mean Mr. King?

115
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:51,997
Mr. King? Nope. Wrong guy.

116
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:54,734
- Good morning.
- Hi, Katie. How are you?

117
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:58,176
- Hi, kids.
- Hi, Katie.

118
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,407
Have a nice day, OK?

119
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,074
- Bye, dad.
- Bye.

120
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,981
Get an "A" in math.

121
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,712
- See you later.
- Bye, Susan. Thank you.

122
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:07,981
You're welcome.

123
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:52,622
Paper! Paper!
Have a paper, mister.

124
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:34,833
You friend Rick is going by
the name of Frederick King now.

125
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,275
Did you get a good look at him?

126
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,743
Good enough.

127
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:41,880
And her?

128
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:44,940
Look, Miss Dolan,
excuse me for being blunt, but...

129
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:47,715
Please. I like blunt.

130
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:50,950
No, I mean, this is all
pretty clear, right?

131
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,927
Mr. King
is a happily married man.

132
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,827
- He never told you.
- Told me what?

133
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:03,427
Look, why don't I just
charge you the retainer fee?

134
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,164
I'll even buy you dinner.

135
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:08,469
Maybe I'll give you
half the retainer fee back.

136
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:11,499
I want you to continue
to follow him.

137
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:13,841
Are you sure you want
this guy in your life?

138
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:16,348
- Mr. Dobbs...
- Harry.

139
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:21,252
As long as I know what
Rick is doing, I have a life.

140
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,483
Gil.

141
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:25,991
Dinner will have to wait,
I'm afraid.

142
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,357
I have a previous engagement.

143
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:10,058
You don't know.

144
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:13,595
What love is.

145
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:19,703
Until you've learned
the meaning of the blues.

146
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,271
Until you've loved.

147
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:28,549
A love you've had to lose.

148
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:32,217
You don't know.

149
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:35,249
What love is.

150
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:11,424
Daddy, daddy, the taxi's here!

151
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:20,129
Thank you, Mr. King.
Flight 2495, gate 89.

152
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,655
Thank you.

153
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,032
I'm on the same flight
as that gentleman.

154
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:30,269
- Flight 2495, right?
- Yeah.

155
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,778
- Do you have a ticket?
- No. I'll need one.

156
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:34,336
Round trip. Coach.

157
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,133
Hi, babe. It's me.

158
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,397
Yeah, I miss you, too.

159
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:36,904
No. I won't be able to call you
for a couple of days.

160
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:39,468
I'm going to be moving around
quite a bit, you know?

161
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,947
Oh, I miss you, too, Doris.
Yeah.

162
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:44,813
Please deposit 25 cents.

163
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:45,976
Look, this is gonna be...

164
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,680
a very rough couple of months
for both of us.

165
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,017
Please deposit..

166
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,228
Hey, how about
goin' out to Culver today?

167
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,323
- Sure, we can do that.
- All right.

168
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:10,867
Wake up!

169
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:15,302
- See that blue and white taxi?
- Yeah.

170
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,808
- Follow it.
- OK.

171
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:21,311
Don't get too close.

172
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:37,491
You know, I had a customer...

173
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:40,055
that was following
a cab like this one time...

174
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:41,827
and, boy, was that something.

175
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:42,993
Yeah? What happened?

176
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:44,867
Wound up
halfway across the state...

177
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:47,770
in a drunk tank,
where I met my third wife.

178
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:51,106
She was the nutritionist
at the honor farm.

179
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:01,148
- Hiram, how are you?
- Good, good, Jimbo.

180
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:02,330
- How you doin"?
- Pretty good.

181
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:03,498
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

182
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:06,787
- Is my truck ready?
- Yes, sir.

183
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,097
You better give me a receipt.

184
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:18,034
You don't want me to wait?

185
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,061
No, just give me a receipt.

186
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:22,335
Last guy I picked up
wanted me to wait.

187
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:24,536
I think he was on
an expense account or something.

188
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:26,120
You can tell by the way
they're dressed.

189
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:28,010
He had a funny little moustache.

190
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:30,378
OK, OK. Just don't get lost.

191
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:32,907
How could I get lost? I'm just
going to be sitting here.

192
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:35,318
No, you're not.
You're gonna follow that truck.

193
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:15,603
If you're going
to that farmhouse down there...

194
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,138
I can just take you
right on down there.

195
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:20,564
- It wouldn't be a problem.
- Aw, would you just shut up?

196
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:22,192
I'll be right back.

197
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,903
Daddy! Daddy!

198
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:43,150
Son of a bitch.

199
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,759
Keep the change.
Write me out a receipt.

200
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,753
I'm gonna sign it for tax
purposes, so it's legitimate.

201
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,049
Fine!

202
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:25,520
Your room's down on the end.

203
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:28,261
OK.

204
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,291
Here, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty.

205
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:40,844
Here, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty.

206
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:43,974
Here, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty.

207
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:45,449
<i>I need a room.</i>

208
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:48,579
- Where are you going?
- I'm leaving.

209
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,884
- Leaving?
- I'll make it short, Larry.

210
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:53,550
- My job's finished.
- Well, what does that mean?

211
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:56,687
Wire me the money. I'll be here
about two more days.

212
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:58,492
I have the feeling...

213
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,625
you're holding something back,
Mr. Dobbs.

214
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,532
Hey, I told you what I saw.

215
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:05,832
He visited someone
on a ranch somewhere.

216
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:09,637
Was there a woman on the ranch?

217
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,209
Yeah.

218
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:15,407
Looked like a family to me.

219
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:25,487
What if I told you
we were to be married once?

220
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,152
After all, she didn't want
to be a bigamist.

221
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,184
No, Larry, I never was.

222
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:31,491
Well...

223
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:35,660
Just don't turn your back
on him, Mr. Dobbs...

224
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,067
unless you want a hole in it.

225
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:42,404
I'll keep that in mind.

226
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,273
Call me tomorrow. I'll be here.

227
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:48,280
Right. And I'll be here.

228
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:50,975
You crossed yourself
as well as everybody else...

229
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:52,177
including me.

230
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:01,124
Room service, please.

231
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,007
- Hello?
- Hello, Doris?

232
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:19,704
Harry!

233
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,271
Where are you?

234
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:25,579
Hey, sounds like
you're having a party there.

235
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:27,745
Oh, I'm just listening to music.

236
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:31,313
- Yeah? With who?
- A few friends.

237
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:35,418
Hey, pour me another highball,
would you?

238
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,794
You want me never to work,
Doris? Is that what you want?

239
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:42,960
I don't want anything anymore,
Harry. I've wised up.

240
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:46,062
And with each day, I learn more.

241
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:59,543
- The price is 250.
- 175.

242
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:03,605
- The price is 250.
- 200.

243
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:06,083
The price is 250.

244
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:07,551
I'll tell you what...

245
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:14,016
I'll give you 150
for as long as I use it...

246
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:17,495
and then when I'm finished,
you get it hack free.

247
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,122
How about that?

248
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:22,293
- Oh, you mean rental.
- That's right, rental.

249
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,427
Well, see,
I'm not in the rental business.

250
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:25,903
The price is 250.

251
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,578
Thank you, honey.

252
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:36,893
- Did you help make these?
- Yes.

253
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:45,348
- Howdy.
- Hello.

254
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:51,996
- Can I help you?
- Well, I seem to be lost.

255
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:55,158
Where are you going?

256
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,744
That's the problem.
I really don't know.

257
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:58,862
I parked my car up the road
and saw your house.

258
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:01,270
Say, Ellen! What's up?

259
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:03,138
It's fine!

260
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:06,974
Maybe we can help you
get back on track.

261
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:08,945
Where are you coming from?

262
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,210
Culver.

263
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:14,776
If I could use your phone,
I'd be glad to pay for it.

264
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:16,981
- Don't be silly. Come on in.
- Thank you.

265
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:23,093
Got one more lunch to deliver.

266
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:36,367
Do you want some lunch?
I can fix you lunch inside.

267
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:37,966
No, thank you. I'm in a hurry.

268
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:39,374
But a cup of coffee
would be great.

269
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,900
You got it.

270
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,174
Hi.

271
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:44,341
- I'll race you to the door.
- OK.

272
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:59,830
The phone's in here
around the corner, sir.

273
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:01,298
Thank you.

274
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:06,997
What's your name?

275
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:11,841
- Harry.
- Harry what?

276
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:15,141
- Uh, Harry Johnson.
- Harry Johnson.

277
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,443
That's right.

278
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,711
Where are you from?
You're not from here.

279
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,549
No, I'm not. I... I just need
to use the phone.

280
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:32,589
Mom, do we have
to let him use the phone?

281
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,894
Honey,
you finish your colorin', OK?

282
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:36,697
Cute.

283
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,644
Merle, it's me, Harry Johnson.

284
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,810
That's right. I'm lost.

285
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,081
Merle wants to know where I am.

286
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:58,316
Crooked River Ranch,
Northwest Prairie Road.

287
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,881
The lady of the house says...

288
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:02,985
Crooked River Ranch,
Northwest Prairie Road.

289
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:08,389
Oh, really? Oh. Mm-hmm.

290
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:09,992
Really?

291
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:13,501
Mm-hmm.

292
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:19,871
Uh-huh.

293
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:22,409
Aha.

294
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:25,382
Thanks for the water,
Mrs. McGraw.

295
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:27,009
You're welcome, Art.

296
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:38,389
So, he wants 300 gross of metal
and then 200 gross plastic.

297
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:40,523
Great. Thanks. Bye.

298
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:47,404
Did you figure out
where you're going?

299
00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:49,304
Oh, yes. Thanks.

300
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:53,072
Boy, if I had this place, I'd be
the happiest guy in the world.

301
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:55,580
Yeah, well, it takes
a lot of work, Mr. Johnson.

302
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:59,811
That it does. Still, it brings
everyone so close together...

303
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:01,319
you know what I mean?

304
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:06,789
- Hello.
- Hi.

305
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:09,293
- James McGraw.
- Johnson. Harry Johnson.

306
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:11,421
- Good to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

307
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:12,606
I was just telling your wife...

308
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:13,807
what a wonderful spread
you have here.

309
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:16,596
I'm in grommet sales myself.

310
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:18,966
Grommets are those little
round plastic and metal...

311
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:20,493
Yeah. I know what a grommet is.

312
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:21,699
- You do?
- Sure.

313
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:23,468
Oh, that's better
than most people.

314
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:26,102
- So, did you make your call?
- Yes, sir. Thank you.

315
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:28,772
And thanks for
that great coffee, Mrs. McGraw.

316
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:30,508
You're welcome.

317
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,749
Bye.

318
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:42,487
Bye, little girl.

319
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:02,978
I love you.

320
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,620
We're at
Harbor Town Country Club...

321
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:46,123
in beautiful Hilton Head,
South Carolina...

322
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:49,559
where Harry Dobbs
is teeing off on the first hole.

323
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:55,327
Oh, he sliced that one
into the rough.

324
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,529
This has always been
a tough fairway for Dobbs.

325
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:23,857
You don't know what love is.

326
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:28,230
Until you learn
the meaning of the blues.

327
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:34,968
Until you've loved a love
you had to lose.

328
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:37,600
You don't know.

329
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:40,043
What love is.

330
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:44,015
You don't know how lips hurt.

331
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:18,206
Well, it's tough, babe.
I know it's tough.

332
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,216
You've got to bear with me, hon.

333
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:23,831
I mean, it's only going
to be a few more years...

334
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:25,032
that I'll work at this pace...

335
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,115
and then we can start
doing the thing, you know...

336
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,958
OK, look, I better go, babe, OK?

337
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:37,491
I love you. OK, good-bye.

338
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:48,673
- Good news, Jim?
- Yeah.

339
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:50,203
More coffee, honey?

340
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:53,115
That cheeseburger to go
will be up in just a second.

341
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,017
I'm going to hit you again, Jim.

342
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:56,486
My man.

343
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:01,783
Sure is good to see you.

344
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,624
It's good to see you, Cal.

345
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,755
How long you here for this time?

346
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:09,195
Well, I might leave
for a couple days...

347
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:11,292
but I'm here
for a few months now, anyway.

348
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,804
Hey, how's that other spread
of yours? Is that doing OK?

349
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,739
Doubled our grazing.
Sold real well at market.

350
00:36:16,774 --> 00:36:19,800
Good night, Cal.

351
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,245
- Take her easy, Jimbo.
- Hiram.

352
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:16,356
Thanks, lady. My goddamned car
committed suicide.

353
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,459
Do you think
you could give me a lift?

354
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:25,737
Seeing as how we're both
staying at the same motel.

355
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:46,990
The Love Manual.

356
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:54,337
Out.

357
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:56,238
Come on. What would that prove?

358
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,005
Look, I am here
visiting friends...

359
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:02,673
and I have seen you
three times in two days...

360
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:04,681
and you have not told me why.

361
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:09,443
Maybe we have
some of the same friends.

362
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:14,086
One word, and you walk.

363
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,875
Uh, thanks again for the lift.

364
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,811
Maybe next time we can discuss
that book you're reading.

365
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:53,497
- Phone for you, Doris.
- Oh, thank you, Mario.

366
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:56,522
Yeah. Hello?

367
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:58,729
Hello, Doris. This is Stella.

368
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:02,728
Oh, right, right.
Hey, somebody turn that down.

369
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:06,141
I've been expecting your call.

370
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,804
What'd you find out?

371
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:11,804
Basically what you told me.
He is on a case.

372
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,978
Does he see her every day?

373
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:18,387
Uh, no. Only in the city.

374
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:21,517
Did you talk to him?

375
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:23,584
Yes, but by accident.

376
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:26,562
What'd you talk about?

377
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:28,292
Well, we didn't. We didn't. No.

378
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:32,098
His car broke down,
and I gave him a ride.

379
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:35,106
That was pretty stupid,
don't you think?

380
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:37,073
It was unavoidable.

381
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:40,738
Oh, yeah?
And what else was unavoidable?

382
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:42,974
Well, what is that
supposed to mean?

383
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:45,948
Your agency said
I could trust you.

384
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:47,314
Look, I am not going to have...

385
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:49,183
this conversation
with you, Doris.

386
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,484
They said a woman
could get closer to him.

387
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:54,822
Now that I know what they mean,
I want my money back.

388
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:57,760
Look, I'm going to get off
the phone now, all right?

389
00:39:57,795 --> 00:40:00,196
If you want to replace me,
that is your privilege...

390
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,359
but right now
I'm going to get some sleep.

391
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,495
Yeah, for a long time,
because you're fired!

392
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,500
Fired? That's great.

393
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:20,039
What am I going to do?

394
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,313
Miss Dolan's <i>room,</i> please.

395
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:24,219
- I'm sorry. She's checked out.
- What?

396
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,747
Miss Dolan's checked out, sir.

397
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:28,350
Did she leave
a forwarding number?

398
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:30,724
No, sir, she didn't.

399
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,024
Right.

400
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:49,536
This better be good.

401
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:53,179
- What?
- Mr. Dobbs?

402
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:57,444
Oh, uh, Miss Dolan. Mm-hmm.

403
00:40:57,488 --> 00:40:59,582
Rick called me.

404
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:02,684
I'm frightened.
Please come back.

405
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:05,491
Did you check out
of the St. Simone Hotel?

406
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:07,725
I had to. He threatened me.

407
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:10,757
I'm in the Devonshire now,
registered under Phillips.

408
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:14,203
He'll kill me
if he finds me, Mr. Dobbs.

409
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:17,503
Harry. Relax.
He can't get to you before I do.

410
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:23,275
Uh, are you at all interested
in his second wife?

411
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,681
What did you say?

412
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:28,151
Another wife?

413
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:33,021
Look, I'll talk to you about it
all when I get in tomorrow, OK?

414
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:37,494
Yes. Don't tell me
anything else now.

415
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:40,725
- Thank you, Mr. Dobbs.
- Harry.

416
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:42,732
Good night.

417
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:40,217
One of us is going to move.

418
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:42,589
Not before the other
explains what is going on.

419
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:46,062
I don't know
what you're talking about.

420
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:47,757
I can find out, you know.

421
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:51,234
I'm not going to be very happy
if you're working for McGraw...

422
00:42:51,268 --> 00:42:52,929
or King.

423
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,904
Is that a threat?

424
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:57,533
Let's just say
I'm very good at what I do.

425
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,634
- Fooled me.
- What's that supposed to mean?

426
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:02,908
You get too close
to your subjects, Mr. Dobbs.

427
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:07,441
You mean
because I went to his house?

428
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:08,883
Well, you're wrong.

429
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:13,516
That just happened to be
a very, very shrewd move.

430
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:15,821
And talk about
getting too close.

431
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:19,818
You got a burgundy super
classic at the airport, hmm?

432
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:21,991
And what about picking me up
on the road, hmm?

433
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:23,966
- Cardinal sin.
- That was unavoidable.

434
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:25,469
What, are you
on your off hours now?

435
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:27,493
Look, I want you to move.

436
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:31,437
Bring us a couple of
Bloody Marys, will you, honey?

437
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:33,307
No ice, no juice, please.

438
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:37,178
- Look, Mr. Dobbs...
- Harry.

439
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:41,515
Harry. This is not ethical.

440
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:45,511
If we were discussing ethics,
it'd be pretty silent here.

441
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:47,684
Excuse me.

442
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:50,822
There you go.

443
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:53,730
You better hang onto this...

444
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:55,732
because we'll probably be
ordering a few more.

445
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:57,097
OK. Thank you.

446
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:10,471
Bad luck to refuse a toast.

447
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:25,360
Does that book explain when
you're falling for someone...

448
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:31,301
whether it's the smile or
the situation you're going for?

449
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,207
Are you in love with someone,
Mr. Dobbs?

450
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:40,369
<i>Ham!-</i>

451
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:42,846
Do you think
that she is in love with you?

452
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,747
Well, that's hard to tell.
She's got a temper, that one.

453
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:49,549
But, see,
we're sort of broken up now.

454
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:52,954
Demolished, basically.

455
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:55,186
But when I think back on it...

456
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:57,250
I can't even remember
the tough times.

457
00:44:57,294 --> 00:45:00,229
- Are you waiting for her?
- Waiting?

458
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:05,031
Yes. The one who is in love
always waits.

459
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:06,264
Says who?

460
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:07,828
It's in the book.

461
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,236
The only waiting
I've been doing...

462
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:11,867
is outside some guy's house.
Both houses.

463
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:13,877
Maybe you're in love
with someone else.

464
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:16,505
Yeah? Well, who?

465
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:19,482
Now, come on, now,
you got to see me through this.

466
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:20,950
Please?

467
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:24,954
Please?

468
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:26,979
Please, please, please?

469
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,490
Please?

470
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:39,927
It is a fact
that you can squash...

471
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:41,481
the person that
you are in love with...

472
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:43,496
under the weight of love itself.

473
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:46,601
- Especially during an argument.
- Squash?

474
00:45:46,643 --> 00:45:48,283
Yes, and then something
usually happens...

475
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:52,306
that makes you jealous
and feel threatened.

476
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:53,475
Not me, sorry.

477
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:54,661
And you say
that you can't get hurt...

478
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:56,653
because you are
no longer a part of it.

479
00:45:56,687 --> 00:45:57,813
A part of what?

480
00:45:57,855 --> 00:45:59,653
This feeling of love
that you have.

481
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:01,067
But you're suffering,
because, in fact...

482
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:03,958
they're not a part of it,
and then you blame yourself.

483
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:06,506
- No, it's all her fault.
- And then you feel guilty...

484
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:08,362
- and you suffer.
- Oh, swell.

485
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:09,876
So, either because
you want to feel guilty...

486
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,144
or because you want
to show the other person...

487
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:13,660
how very unhappy you are,
you become critical of yourself.

488
00:46:13,704 --> 00:46:15,672
You change your clothes,
you change your habits...

489
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:19,472
you change your hair,
and you wait.

490
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:25,982
It's the lover's signature.

491
00:46:27,551 --> 00:46:29,576
What is?

492
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:35,986
They're the ones who wait.

493
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:39,295
Am I going to see you around?

494
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:42,697
No, Mr. Dobbs. From now on,
when you turn around...

495
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:44,861
all you're going to see
is your shoulder.

496
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:46,336
No. I mean, you know...

497
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:49,101
a show, a dinner,
or something unethical.

498
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,005
No, I'm afraid
that I can't do that.

499
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:54,011
Why?
You waiting for someone else?

500
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,906
- Yes.
- Oh.

501
00:46:57,948 --> 00:47:00,940
I mean, I have an agency
I have to deal with.

502
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:03,146
Oh, forget the agency.
Hang out a shingle.

503
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:05,849
Go into business for yourself.
It's the only way.

504
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:08,153
- Like you.
- That's right.

505
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:09,682
You know
I can find out your name.

506
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:12,923
Oh, really? You know,
I'm not so sure of that.

507
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:15,955
Well, you can make it easy,
or you can test me.

508
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:20,401
Stella.

509
00:47:20,437 --> 00:47:21,871
Oh, I like that.

510
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:24,067
You got another name?
Don't say Smith.

511
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:25,973
You don't want to know me.

512
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:28,273
Too late for that.

513
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:31,839
Why do you think that
your man has two families?

514
00:47:31,882 --> 00:47:34,442
Most bigamists do.
Who hired you to follow me?

515
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:37,545
Do you think that
he loves them both equally?

516
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:39,078
Does it matter?

517
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:41,250
Well, don't you think it would?
To him, I mean?

518
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:44,556
Would you stop with that stuff“?
I... was it Miss Dolan?

519
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:50,490
Believe me,
it's... it's not important.

520
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,781
- Mr. Dobbs.
- Harry.

521
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:16,259
I'm so glad you're here.

522
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:17,727
Would you like a drink?

523
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:20,628
- Aw...
- Cognac all right?

524
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:21,893
Sure.

525
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:25,459
Please, go on in and sit down.
I'll be right there.

526
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:54,063
I'm ready now to hear
what you've learned.

527
00:48:57,801 --> 00:48:59,929
So...

528
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:01,404
from the beginning.

529
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:04,533
From the beginning?

530
00:49:04,574 --> 00:49:07,737
Well, I didn't much like
the airplane trip.

531
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:10,941
You poor dear.
You must be exhausted.

532
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:13,814
Please, go on.

533
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:15,841
Why don't we start
with what you know?

534
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:18,116
It'd be a lot easier.

535
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:22,114
Well, I'm afraid my story
is very complicated, Harry.

536
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:24,457
May I call you Harry?

537
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:30,698
You think I still love him,
don't you?

538
00:49:30,734 --> 00:49:33,567
You think
that's why I came to town.

539
00:49:33,603 --> 00:49:36,038
I know he does...

540
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:39,304
To be close to him,
wait my turn...

541
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:41,471
take my chances.

542
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:46,979
Well, I could never
love him again.

543
00:49:49,086 --> 00:49:51,987
Especially if...

544
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:55,481
what you said on the phone
is true.

545
00:49:56,793 --> 00:49:59,262
How true it is,
I can't tell you...

546
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:01,993
but I know it to be a fact.

547
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:06,002
Two wives.

548
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:08,999
My God.

549
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,004
I'm sorry.

550
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,508
Look, just let him go.

551
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:21,847
Wipe him out of your memory.

552
00:50:21,885 --> 00:50:25,321
Whatever you do,
don't be jealous.

553
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:28,222
You'll... you'll start
hurting yourself.

554
00:50:28,258 --> 00:50:30,249
You'll feel guilty.

555
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:33,285
Your hair.
You'll... you'll cut your hair...

556
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:35,992
and I kind of like it
the way it is.

557
00:50:38,602 --> 00:50:40,263
He's so very dangerous.

558
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:42,931
He's taken money from people
and beaten them up...

559
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:46,032
Maybe...

560
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:48,878
even murder.

561
00:50:50,113 --> 00:50:52,275
All around good guy, huh?

562
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:02,358
I'm really glad you're here.

563
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:11,093
Oh, my God. It's him.

564
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:35,016
- Dry cleaning.
- Thanks. Here you go.

565
00:51:37,294 --> 00:51:39,023
- Fine.
- Thank you, sir.

566
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,664
I think I'd better get
a room in this hotel...

567
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:47,295
On this floor, if I can.

568
00:51:47,337 --> 00:51:49,897
Yes. I want you to.

569
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,169
Now that you're here...

570
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:53,677
I feel that no one
can lay a finger on me.

571
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:55,735
Right.

572
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:58,214
Uh, keep your door locked.
Don't let anybody in.

573
00:51:58,248 --> 00:52:00,444
Yes.

574
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:03,476
- I'm going to check in now.
- Yes.

575
00:52:29,746 --> 00:52:30,872
Over here on your right...

576
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:32,905
we have the honor bar,
Mr. Dobbs.

577
00:52:34,784 --> 00:52:37,810
We do have twenty-four-hour
room service available.

578
00:52:37,854 --> 00:52:40,448
On the rooftop,
we have a ninety-foot pool.

579
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,083
Whoa.

580
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:44,719
And I hope
that you enjoy your stay.

581
00:52:44,761 --> 00:52:46,559
No golf course?

582
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:50,032
Some of our larger suites
do have putting greens.

583
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,703
Thank you very much.

584
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:03,974
He's just checked in
on the same floor.

585
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:15,424
Twenty four hours in a day,
buster. Use them. Out.

586
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:18,393
So, I suppose you think
I'm a failure, right, Corinne?

587
00:53:18,428 --> 00:53:21,090
What do you want to hear,
that people don't get fired?

588
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:22,963
Well, they do.
That's the bottom line, kid.

589
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:24,865
But I didn't do anything wrong.

590
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:27,165
Who said anything about wrong?

591
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:28,414
The client didn't like
what you were doing...

592
00:53:28,438 --> 00:53:30,497
so you got canned,
pure and simple.

593
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:33,771
I didn't deserve it!
You should've stood up for me!

594
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:35,574
Stella, from the beginning...

595
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:37,273
I'm wondering
what you're doing here.

596
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:39,942
You wander in,
say you want detective work...

597
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:41,212
like it's a haircut.

598
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:42,595
Your first big assignment...
You blow it.

599
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:44,883
<i>So</i> I let you down,
is that what you're saying?

600
00:53:44,921 --> 00:53:46,616
I'm saying you're smart,
you look OK...

601
00:53:46,656 --> 00:53:48,784
you got some class.

602
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:52,386
I have to do this kind of work
just to get attention.

603
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:53,897
You don't.

604
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:56,331
Why do you want to hang around
shady characters...

605
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:59,233
looking for things
that never add up?

606
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:01,237
You gotta be a little weird
for that, Stella...

607
00:54:01,271 --> 00:54:03,899
and you're not weird...
Not that weird.

608
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:05,772
Not enough to keep a man away.

609
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:08,107
Whatever happened to that guy?
He come back or what?

610
00:54:08,144 --> 00:54:09,441
What?

611
00:54:09,479 --> 00:54:10,919
Look, I know
you're on the rebound...

612
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:12,745
from a bad love deal...

613
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:15,410
but this work
ain't a cure-all, you know.

614
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:17,546
So, you want to get
rid of me, Corinne?

615
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:20,454
Stella, I am trying to help you.

616
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:21,634
You're the kind of gal
who should be out...

617
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:24,218
with a guy on a date,
not a stakeout.

618
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:26,855
You let me worry
about the men in my life.

619
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:29,729
And you let me run my business
the way I have to!

620
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:35,129
Oh, so I am fired.

621
00:54:42,379 --> 00:54:47,943
Oh, that's... that's fine.
That's fine. Just... just great.

622
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:50,851
Just perfect. Perfect!

623
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,667
Miss Dolan?

624
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,334
It's me, Harry.

625
00:55:12,108 --> 00:55:14,475
Open up in the name of the law.

626
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:22,451
Miss Dolan.

627
00:55:31,227 --> 00:55:32,820
Miss Phillips?

628
00:55:56,953 --> 00:56:01,015
- Hello?
- Doris, it's Stella.

629
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:02,183
Who?

630
00:56:02,225 --> 00:56:04,717
Stella.

631
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:07,128
Hey, I thought I fired you.

632
00:56:07,163 --> 00:56:09,655
Yeah, I got your message.

633
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,224
Then what do you want?

634
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:19,197
Well, actually, I was wondering
if you had a number on Harry.

635
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:37,216
Have you known my husband
very long, Mr. Wyman?

636
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:40,286
No, not really, but long enough.

637
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:41,820
<i>Mmm.</i>

638
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:50,436
So, what is the message
my husband asked you to deliver?

639
00:56:50,473 --> 00:56:53,738
Mrs. King,
does the name "James McGraw"...

640
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:56,838
have any meaning to you?

641
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:02,410
Um, no. That's not
familiar to me. Why?

642
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:07,219
Well, he's someone
your husband knows quite well.

643
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:08,418
And?

644
00:57:09,893 --> 00:57:13,887
And, well, he's with him
right now, actually.

645
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:17,560
Well, as I said
when you first came in...

646
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,433
I'm not that familiar with
Freddie's business dealings.

647
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:21,747
Is there something wrong,
Mr. Wyman?

648
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:23,349
Why do I get the feeling
that something is wrong?

649
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:26,536
- Freddie's all right, isn't he?
- Well, yeah, sure.

650
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:29,807
He's got his hands full,
but he's fine otherwise.

651
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:33,077
You seem so nervous.
I'm feeling something else.

652
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:36,950
Well, I do apologize
about that, Mrs. King.

653
00:57:36,986 --> 00:57:39,683
To tell you the truth,
something has happened.

654
00:57:39,722 --> 00:57:41,850
To Freddie? Has something
happened to Freddie?

655
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:45,156
No, to a friend of mine.
Someone who Fred knows.

656
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:48,495
I don't understand.

657
00:57:48,531 --> 00:57:52,968
Her name is Miss Dolan.

658
00:57:54,604 --> 00:57:57,835
And your husband...

659
00:57:57,874 --> 00:57:59,433
Yes?

660
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:03,879
Well, he knows
that I know her...

661
00:58:03,913 --> 00:58:09,147
and I thought maybe he might
have mentioned her to you.

662
00:58:09,185 --> 00:58:12,951
I... I haven't seen her
in a while.

663
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:15,788
You're confusing me, Mr. Wyman.

664
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:18,954
Ohh, I'm sorry about that.

665
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,861
Look, I can see
that you know nothing...

666
00:58:20,897 --> 00:58:25,596
about Miss Dolan
or Mr. McGraw...

667
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:27,797
and I'm kind of anxious,
you know...

668
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:31,967
Oh, anxiety
is the devil's impatience.

669
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:36,002
Yeah. Look, Mrs. King, I...

670
00:58:36,045 --> 00:58:38,104
I'd really appreciate it
if you didn't...

671
00:58:38,147 --> 00:58:40,115
say anything at all
about all this to Fred.

672
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:42,027
He might think I've gone
around the bend, you know?

673
00:58:42,051 --> 00:58:45,112
No, no. He'd understand.
You're friends.

674
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:50,854
Well, a friend in need
is a friend to avoid.

675
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:52,919
I'm sorry to bother you
about all this, ma'am.

676
00:58:52,962 --> 00:58:54,726
- No, no.
- Good-bye.

677
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:56,027
Good-bye.

678
00:59:25,094 --> 00:59:28,120
I'm thirsty. You?

679
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:32,396
Bellhop says she's still
not back in her <i>room.</i>

680
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:34,699
But you said that her clothes
were still there.

681
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:36,102
Yeah.

682
00:59:36,139 --> 00:59:40,667
So, we know that she didn't
leave permanently...

683
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:41,836
if she left alone.

684
00:59:41,878 --> 00:59:43,141
Right.

685
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:48,246
"We"?

686
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:50,275
Yeah. You need a dictionary?
You and me.

687
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,446
That ain't written anywhere.

688
00:59:51,487 --> 00:59:54,286
No, Harry, this case
is way too spread out.

689
00:59:54,324 --> 00:59:56,520
- You need a partner.
- You're lookin' at my partner.

690
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:00,928
All right, Harry, fine, fine.
You can be the boss.

691
01:00:00,964 --> 01:00:04,491
I was just trying to help you
solve this thing.

692
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:06,161
Why?

693
01:00:06,202 --> 01:00:08,534
Because
it's so fucking exciting.

694
01:00:08,571 --> 01:00:09,936
Oh, Annie Oakley?

695
01:00:09,973 --> 01:00:11,600
Yeah, when
there's a gun in my hand.

696
01:00:11,641 --> 01:00:14,406
Yeah? Whose gun?

697
01:00:16,245 --> 01:00:18,304
I just thought maybe
a woman's intuition...

698
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:20,646
could've helped you
crack this thing.

699
01:00:20,683 --> 01:00:22,310
That's the first time
we've touched.

700
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:26,914
I could have gotten much more
out of Mrs. King than you did.

701
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:29,584
- I got what I needed.
- You got nothing!

702
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:32,254
- What I needed to know.
- What?

703
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:34,764
I didn't want to hurt her.

704
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:40,528
Well, sometimes
it helps to hurt.

705
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:43,596
She really loves this guy.

706
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,972
She said that?

707
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:47,477
She didn't need to say it.

708
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:50,775
- Suddenly you're the expert?
- No, you're the expert.

709
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:52,941
You've got something, Stella.

710
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:55,781
I don't know what it is,
but you got it.

711
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:58,981
You ever been married, Stella?
Yeah, me, either.

712
01:00:59,022 --> 01:01:00,566
You know, they say
a marriage is the best thing...

713
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:01,867
that's supposed to happen
between two people...

714
01:01:01,891 --> 01:01:03,416
Or the worst.

715
01:01:03,459 --> 01:01:06,360
- Ever want kids, Stella?
- Kids?

716
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:07,940
Yeah. Little people
running around with your face.

717
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:09,432
I know what they are.

718
01:01:09,465 --> 01:01:11,991
Yes, I would like kids,
but not now, OK?

719
01:01:12,035 --> 01:01:14,936
I didn't mean now.
Not at all now.

720
01:01:17,707 --> 01:01:19,436
So, who's the man in your life,
Stella?

721
01:01:19,475 --> 01:01:22,410
Are you gonna call the cops
or what?

722
01:01:22,445 --> 01:01:24,470
You're still waitin"?

723
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:30,447
Your friend is missing.

724
01:01:30,486 --> 01:01:34,855
The guy who might have done it
can hurt people in strange ways.

725
01:01:34,891 --> 01:01:38,589
Now, either you can sit here
and continue to flirt with me...

726
01:01:38,628 --> 01:01:39,754
Flirt?

727
01:01:39,796 --> 01:01:42,891
Or maybe we can help each other
and save someone's life.

728
01:01:44,801 --> 01:01:46,428
Or fuck 'em up.

729
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:49,530
Harry, one of us
has to fly up north tomorrow.

730
01:01:49,572 --> 01:01:50,767
Right. Me.

731
01:01:50,807 --> 01:01:54,471
Fine. OK, I will keep an eye
on the King house...

732
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:56,842
and the hotel
and maybe make some calls.

733
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:58,244
- No.
- No?

734
01:01:58,281 --> 01:02:01,273
OK, then I will leave
first thing in the morning...

735
01:02:01,317 --> 01:02:02,978
and you can reach me
at the same motel.

736
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:05,078
- No.
- God damn you!

737
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:06,816
Look,
this guy could be dangerous.

738
01:02:06,856 --> 01:02:08,620
Besides that,
there's something going on...

739
01:02:08,658 --> 01:02:11,184
between Mrs. McGraw
and the young ranch hand.

740
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:12,456
Really?

741
01:02:12,495 --> 01:02:16,125
It could get sticky, and
I don't want you up there alone.

742
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:20,898
Harry, if you were born stupid,
you're now having a relapse.

743
01:02:20,937 --> 01:02:23,031
I'm going to take
the 10:00 am. Plane.

744
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:26,269
This is my phone here,
and I also have a service.

745
01:02:26,309 --> 01:02:29,210
Stella, listen. You...

746
01:02:36,018 --> 01:02:37,747
Good night, Harry.

747
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:41,383
What was that?

748
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:43,791
Comes with the slap.

749
01:02:43,826 --> 01:02:45,760
<i>So</i> does this, babe.

750
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:55,633
- Stella...
- What?

751
01:02:55,671 --> 01:02:57,765
- Come to my hotel tonight.
- No.

752
01:02:57,807 --> 01:02:58,968
Why not?

753
01:03:00,676 --> 01:03:02,576
I'll call you.

754
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:16,516
Harry, come on.

755
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:19,358
Stella, something's happening
in a hurry.

756
01:03:19,395 --> 01:03:22,296
Yeah, it's a scene. You love
a scene. You told me that.

757
01:03:22,331 --> 01:03:25,357
- I didn't say that.
- Yes, you did.

758
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:26,869
- What?
- Yes.

759
01:03:26,903 --> 01:03:30,168
You said that you couldn't
tell the difference...

760
01:03:30,206 --> 01:03:34,439
between a smile and a situation.

761
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:37,538
Aw, well, I'm learning fast.

762
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:44,611
Besides, you got the smile,
and this is the situation.

763
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:46,122
Please?

764
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:51,286
Oh. You have to get up
in the morning. I have to pack.

765
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:53,421
Then I got to go, and...

766
01:03:55,097 --> 01:03:56,656
OK.

767
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:03,101
- Hey, Harry.
- Yeah.

768
01:04:04,473 --> 01:04:05,838
Good night.

769
01:04:55,491 --> 01:04:58,153
Call me, Harry.

770
01:05:09,138 --> 01:05:12,164
Why don't you call me, Harry?

771
01:05:24,854 --> 01:05:25,980
Yeah.

772
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:28,514
- Stella.
- Yeah.

773
01:05:28,557 --> 01:05:32,255
It's me... Harry.

774
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:35,128
- Yeah.
- Did I wake you?

775
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:39,929
Yeah.

776
01:05:42,638 --> 01:05:45,767
Well, what do you want me
to say?

777
01:05:45,808 --> 01:05:48,743
About what?

778
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,507
You know.

779
01:05:52,682 --> 01:05:55,515
I have to get some sleep, Harry.

780
01:05:55,551 --> 01:05:57,576
- Stella.
- Yeah.

781
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:59,679
Let me come over there.

782
01:05:59,722 --> 01:06:02,919
Oh, Harry,
I don't... I don't think so.

783
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:07,021
I... I have to go to sleep, OK?

784
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:09,054
- Stella.
- Yeah.

785
01:06:09,098 --> 01:06:14,264
Uh, you just be careful
with McGraw, OK?

786
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:18,797
Um, yeah. Yeah, I will.

787
01:06:18,841 --> 01:06:21,572
Good night, Stella.

788
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:25,638
- Hey, Harry.
- Yeah.

789
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:28,810
I'm... I'm glad
that we're partners.

790
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:33,547
Yeah, me, too.

791
01:06:33,589 --> 01:06:35,353
Good night, Stella.

792
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:38,122
OK. Good night.

793
01:06:44,266 --> 01:06:47,395
What if I said I'm falling
in love with you, Stella?

794
01:06:49,372 --> 01:06:51,136
What if I said that?

795
01:06:54,944 --> 01:06:58,141
I'd look for a sign, Harry.

796
01:07:07,890 --> 01:07:11,884
- Hi.
- Stella?

797
01:07:11,927 --> 01:07:13,088
How you doing?

798
01:07:15,231 --> 01:07:18,292
- Marty?
- Yeah.

799
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:23,595
Why are you calling me, Marty?

800
01:07:23,639 --> 01:07:26,199
Why, you don't want me to?

801
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:29,872
You made it very clear
that you didn't want me.

802
01:07:29,912 --> 01:07:33,644
Well, maybe that's not
so clear right now.

803
01:07:33,682 --> 01:07:34,843
Is there somebody else?

804
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:39,185
Uh, yeah. There might be.

805
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:41,019
Oh, that's good.

806
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:43,719
Good. Good, good, good. Mm-hmm.

807
01:07:43,759 --> 01:07:48,287
Stella, take it easy.
It's been real nice knowing you.

808
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:51,664
Marty, you're an asshole.

809
01:08:15,024 --> 01:08:16,185
Yeah.

810
01:08:23,299 --> 01:08:25,768
I got a message to deliver, pal.

811
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:33,034
Out. Out!

812
01:08:33,075 --> 01:08:35,271
We'll continue
this talk later, pal.

813
01:09:02,671 --> 01:09:04,605
- The phone's right here.
- Oh, thank you.

814
01:09:36,038 --> 01:09:38,803
You're at Crooked River Ranch,
Northwest Prairie Road.

815
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:41,173
Ah, thank you.

816
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:47,015
Hey, Earl. Yeah.
It's about those packages.

817
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:50,482
Mm-hmm.

818
01:09:57,693 --> 01:09:58,854
Uh-huh.

819
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:02,688
- I'm thirsty.
- Yeah.

820
01:10:07,236 --> 01:10:08,704
Mm-hmm.

821
01:10:15,477 --> 01:10:16,638
God.

822
01:10:30,025 --> 01:10:32,687
Thanks for the water,
Mrs. McGraw.

823
01:10:38,133 --> 01:10:40,158
You're welcome, Art.

824
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:48,677
What is going on?

825
01:10:48,711 --> 01:10:51,612
Jim, you're hurting me.

826
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:54,241
And what do you think
you're doing to me?

827
01:10:54,283 --> 01:10:56,081
Now, something's going on
when I'm not here.

828
01:10:56,118 --> 01:10:57,916
Yeah, which is most of the time.

829
01:10:59,888 --> 01:11:02,084
OK, what are you saying, girl?

830
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:07,794
Nothing.

831
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:09,662
I'm saying nothing.

832
01:11:09,698 --> 01:11:13,362
Of course it doesn't help
that you're never around.

833
01:11:13,402 --> 01:11:15,564
No, except my making a living.

834
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:17,094
I mean around here for me!

835
01:11:17,139 --> 01:11:20,404
Look, Ellen, you knew I had
another ranch when I met you...

836
01:11:20,442 --> 01:11:22,240
so we're not
talking about it now.

837
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:23,677
But we never talk!

838
01:11:23,712 --> 01:11:26,773
Does Missy know about
what you've been...

839
01:11:28,317 --> 01:11:29,443
Mm-hmm.

840
01:11:29,485 --> 01:11:30,895
Hey, you in there.
Are you about done?

841
01:11:30,919 --> 01:11:32,580
Yeah. I'm just about ready
to hang up.

842
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:33,747
Well, hang up.

843
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:37,089
Yeah, Herman, I'll get you
that delivery this afternoon.

844
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:40,221
- OK, bye.
- OK. All right, then. Bye-bye.

845
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,664
Thanks for the coffee, ma'am.

846
01:11:46,702 --> 01:11:48,192
Where are my keys?

847
01:11:52,007 --> 01:11:55,705
You were listening.
This is none of your business.

848
01:11:55,744 --> 01:11:57,405
Well, I see you crying.

849
01:11:57,446 --> 01:11:59,175
I'm a woman.

850
01:12:02,351 --> 01:12:04,445
That doesn't make it
your affair.

851
01:12:30,879 --> 01:12:33,644
Follow me, please.

852
01:12:35,484 --> 01:12:37,748
- Mr. Wyman is here to see you.
- Thank you, Pamela.

853
01:12:37,786 --> 01:12:39,151
Thank you.

854
01:12:40,556 --> 01:12:42,923
I hope I'm not bothering you,
Mrs. King.

855
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:44,983
I'm just doing some weeding.

856
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:49,487
Oh, always healthy to do that...
In your garden, in your life.

857
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:52,432
Is that why you came back,
Mr. Wyman? To discuss weeding?

858
01:12:52,468 --> 01:12:54,163
No, not directly.

859
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:56,638
Then what is it?

860
01:12:56,672 --> 01:12:58,231
This is the second time
we've met...

861
01:12:58,273 --> 01:12:59,617
and the second time
I've wondered...

862
01:12:59,641 --> 01:13:01,666
what your real motives
are for being here.

863
01:13:02,845 --> 01:13:05,212
Just honest concern.

864
01:13:05,247 --> 01:13:08,444
I know what it's like to be
gone from someone you love.

865
01:13:11,754 --> 01:13:13,347
Is it your purpose
to come here...

866
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:15,448
and cast doubts
upon my marriage?

867
01:13:15,491 --> 01:13:17,425
Are you really
an enemy of my husband's...

868
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:19,188
disguised as a friend?

869
01:13:20,596 --> 01:13:24,226
I'm not an enemy at all,
Mrs. King.

870
01:13:25,934 --> 01:13:29,302
It is all about value,
Mr. Wyman...

871
01:13:29,338 --> 01:13:31,363
and love is my value...

872
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:34,308
Love for my husband
and for my family.

873
01:13:34,343 --> 01:13:37,643
Now, please,
I'm asking you to leave.

874
01:13:40,549 --> 01:13:42,244
The one who loves waits.

875
01:13:42,284 --> 01:13:44,480
What are you implying?

876
01:13:46,021 --> 01:13:48,251
Are you trying to hurt me?

877
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:51,521
- Are you the devil?
- The devil?

878
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:54,791
I love my husband,
and he loves me.

879
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:57,060
We are constantly
reaffirming this fact...

880
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:58,309
and cannot be threatened
by anyone...

881
01:13:58,333 --> 01:14:01,564
I'm sorry, Mrs. King. I...
I'm sorry! I really am!

882
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:03,162
You're the devil!

883
01:14:13,048 --> 01:14:15,574
Here's your peanut butter
and cheese crackers...

884
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:17,381
and your change.

885
01:14:17,419 --> 01:14:18,853
Hey, Cal.

886
01:14:18,887 --> 01:14:24,792
Uh, you can set me up, and
I'd like to square up my tab.

887
01:14:24,827 --> 01:14:26,795
I got to make a phone call.

888
01:14:30,799 --> 01:14:33,564
I'll have
whatever he's drinking.

889
01:14:33,602 --> 01:14:35,127
Yes, ma'am.

890
01:14:40,342 --> 01:14:42,140
Hi, hon, it's me.

891
01:14:43,712 --> 01:14:45,771
Yeah.
I'm going to be coming home.

892
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:53,114
Thank you.

893
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:57,785
I love you.

894
01:14:57,826 --> 01:15:00,659
I love you. Bye.

895
01:15:00,696 --> 01:15:01,993
I love you.

896
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:05,300
I love you.

897
01:15:17,112 --> 01:15:20,013
- You keep 'em coming, Cal.
- All right.

898
01:15:25,888 --> 01:15:27,879
- Hey, I know you.
- We meet again.

899
01:15:27,923 --> 01:15:29,015
Yeah, so we do.

900
01:15:29,057 --> 01:15:31,856
Your wife was kind enough
to let me use the phone.

901
01:15:33,228 --> 01:15:35,390
Well, it's my phone, too.

902
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:42,134
Yes, but I can't tell
if you're kind yet.

903
01:15:43,939 --> 01:15:45,703
<i>Some</i> people think I'm very kind.

904
01:15:45,741 --> 01:15:47,004
Oh, and others?

905
01:15:49,044 --> 01:15:50,724
Well, they just don't know
the whole story.

906
01:15:57,119 --> 01:15:59,781
You know,
a man's got to be who he is.

907
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:05,293
I mean, most people, they just
go on sleepwalking through life.

908
01:16:05,327 --> 01:16:08,160
They haven't got a fucking clue.

909
01:16:08,196 --> 01:16:10,028
See, I know who I am...

910
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:13,558
and I ain't going to change,
so why not just go forward?

911
01:16:13,602 --> 01:16:17,197
Why not just forge ahead
wherever it leads?

912
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:18,638
No matter what the risk.

913
01:16:18,674 --> 01:16:20,733
Yeah, risk.
You got to go out on a limb...

914
01:16:20,776 --> 01:16:22,471
because that's where
the fruits are.

915
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:32,611
You're a nosy little person,
now, aren't you?

916
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:39,622
It's rare that I encounter
someone who lives life so fully.

917
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:43,361
Well, you don't know
the half of it.

918
01:16:43,398 --> 01:16:46,129
Oh, I think I know both halves.

919
01:16:50,806 --> 01:16:52,638
What's your name?

920
01:16:54,343 --> 01:16:57,278
Stella Wynkowski. Yours?

921
01:16:57,312 --> 01:16:59,076
James McG raw.

922
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:01,640
James McGraw. Fits you.

923
01:17:03,185 --> 01:17:05,654
Fits you like a king.

924
01:17:10,492 --> 01:17:11,982
Like what?

925
01:17:13,662 --> 01:17:15,721
A king..

926
01:17:15,764 --> 01:17:18,426
You know, the principal piece
in the game of chess.

927
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:28,440
McGraw?
I want to talk to you outside.

928
01:17:29,511 --> 01:17:31,445
I ain't moving
from this bar stool, Arthur...

929
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,312
except to fire your coward ass.

930
01:17:33,348 --> 01:17:35,783
Well, that suits me fine,
because what I'll do is...

931
01:17:35,817 --> 01:17:37,729
I'll go back there,
and I'll get Ellen and Missy...

932
01:17:37,753 --> 01:17:39,631
and you ain't doing
a thing about it, all right?

933
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:43,319
We won't be having
no trouble here, Art.

934
01:17:46,728 --> 01:17:49,163
I'm going to wipe the floor
with this piece of puppy shit...

935
01:17:49,197 --> 01:17:50,942
and then I'm going to get
some answers out of you.

936
01:17:50,966 --> 01:17:55,528
Yeah? I hardly think that
you're man enough to do either.

937
01:17:55,570 --> 01:17:57,402
Watch my hat for me.

938
01:18:15,323 --> 01:18:18,657
You don't deserve her.
You're never even there.

939
01:18:26,601 --> 01:18:29,070
Why would you want
to ruin her life?

940
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:38,873
I didn't ruin her life!

941
01:18:38,914 --> 01:18:45,217
Why would you hurt somebody
if you loved her? Huh?

942
01:18:46,621 --> 01:18:49,454
I never hurt anybody.

943
01:19:39,841 --> 01:19:41,400
Miss Dolan?

944
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:44,902
- Harry?
- Who?

945
01:19:44,946 --> 01:19:47,005
You lied to me, Harry.

946
01:19:47,048 --> 01:19:50,416
Rick's not married to anybody,
are you, baby?

947
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:52,944
- Who is this guy?
- Who is this guy?

948
01:19:52,988 --> 01:19:55,116
He's just
an acquaintance, baby...

949
01:19:55,157 --> 01:19:58,616
Someone I thought I could trust.

950
01:19:59,995 --> 01:20:02,555
- Hmm.
- Get in the car.

951
01:20:02,597 --> 01:20:05,066
Harley, I don't like
this acquaintance.

952
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:08,001
- Right.
- Hey.

953
01:20:08,036 --> 01:20:09,470
We'll take care of her, pal.

954
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:13,463
Good.

955
01:20:17,345 --> 01:20:20,315
- Are you all right, sir?
- Get out of here!

956
01:20:44,005 --> 01:20:45,871
Art?

957
01:20:45,907 --> 01:20:47,432
I'm driving
you and your daughter...

958
01:20:47,475 --> 01:20:48,965
to your nearest relative.

959
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:51,911
You got one minute to pack.

960
01:20:51,947 --> 01:20:53,915
I'm packed.

961
01:21:00,889 --> 01:21:03,620
Where are we going, mom?

962
01:21:03,658 --> 01:21:06,093
We're going to the airport,
sweetie.

963
01:21:06,127 --> 01:21:08,858
Why?

964
01:21:08,897 --> 01:21:11,195
We're going to go visit
grandma for a little while.

965
01:21:11,233 --> 01:21:15,966
What about daddy?
Did he go away again?

966
01:21:18,773 --> 01:21:21,174
Yeah. He's gone.

967
01:21:22,444 --> 01:21:24,344
Why don't you go back to sleep?

968
01:21:52,007 --> 01:21:53,975
OK, boss, see you tomorrow.

969
01:21:54,009 --> 01:21:56,341
Make it early, Harley.

970
01:21:56,378 --> 01:21:58,676
It's already early.

971
01:22:27,475 --> 01:22:29,569
Rick, where are you?

972
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:32,080
I'm so very ready.

973
01:22:32,113 --> 01:22:35,139
I'm glad you're ready,
angel baby...

974
01:22:35,183 --> 01:22:38,585
because ready or not,
here comes Rick.

975
01:22:49,898 --> 01:22:51,491
How do I look?

976
01:22:51,533 --> 01:22:53,661
You look...

977
01:22:58,373 --> 01:22:59,772
Did you hear that?

978
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:02,072
Only the pounding of my heart.

979
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:05,273
Well, keep on pounding,
angel baby. I'll be right back.

980
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:09,679
Harley?

981
01:23:13,121 --> 01:23:14,816
Harley?

982
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:25,764
Oh! Oh!

983
01:23:28,370 --> 01:23:30,600
Hey! Hey!

984
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:33,931
Hey!

985
01:23:36,244 --> 01:23:37,643
Rick?

986
01:23:41,816 --> 01:23:44,308
Mr. Dobbs.

987
01:23:44,352 --> 01:23:45,751
Ham!

988
01:23:45,787 --> 01:23:48,415
Where is everybody?

989
01:23:48,456 --> 01:23:51,323
- Hanging around. Get dressed.
- Dressed?

990
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:52,849
Hey!

991
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:02,602
Oh, that bitch.

992
01:24:02,637 --> 01:24:05,106
That bitch.

993
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:12,343
Whoa!

994
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:14,314
Hey!

995
01:24:14,349 --> 01:24:17,375
Help!

996
01:24:17,419 --> 01:24:19,945
Help!

997
01:24:44,813 --> 01:24:48,477
Please, Harry.
At least acknowledge me.

998
01:24:48,516 --> 01:24:51,645
I'm feeling frightened
and unloved...

999
01:24:51,686 --> 01:24:53,552
Naked to the world.

1000
01:25:11,573 --> 01:25:12,734
Oh, my God.

1001
01:25:20,081 --> 01:25:21,378
Jesus, Harry.

1002
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:37,592
Well...

1003
01:25:37,632 --> 01:25:40,033
I had to find out about Rick...

1004
01:25:40,068 --> 01:25:42,730
find out if he was the one.

1005
01:25:42,770 --> 01:25:45,239
You do understand?

1006
01:25:45,273 --> 01:25:46,638
Oh...

1007
01:25:48,343 --> 01:25:51,108
Is there a chance for us, Harry?

1008
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:53,638
For you and me?

1009
01:25:53,681 --> 01:25:55,479
What?

1010
01:25:55,517 --> 01:25:58,509
Would we be glad and dizzy
all the time...

1011
01:25:58,553 --> 01:26:00,385
or would we destroy each other?

1012
01:26:00,421 --> 01:26:04,654
Glad and dizzy?
Miss Dolan, get on the train.

1013
01:26:04,692 --> 01:26:08,754
Harry, please... the truth.

1014
01:26:08,796 --> 01:26:11,663
Aren't you in love with me?

1015
01:26:12,967 --> 01:26:15,299
Miss Dolan...

1016
01:26:15,336 --> 01:26:17,805
it would be as thrilling
as winning the exacta...

1017
01:26:17,839 --> 01:26:20,035
but I'm in love
with someone else.

1018
01:26:20,074 --> 01:26:21,599
May I have your attention,
please?

1019
01:26:21,643 --> 01:26:24,874
The Star Coast Starlight
Special, train number 11...

1020
01:26:24,913 --> 01:26:27,678
is arriving
through gate number one.

1021
01:26:27,715 --> 01:26:31,481
- Good-bye, Miss Dolan.
- Gwendolyn.

1022
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:56,273
Your case and your ticket,
Miss Dolan.

1023
01:26:56,311 --> 01:26:58,439
All aboard!

1024
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:05,650
All aboard!

1025
01:27:06,888 --> 01:27:09,016
Good-bye, Harry.

1026
01:27:12,527 --> 01:27:13,688
Excuse me.

1027
01:27:19,133 --> 01:27:21,659
533'. You going far?

1028
01:27:24,005 --> 01:27:25,837
Aw, life.

1029
01:28:45,253 --> 01:28:47,347
- Remember me?
- Jesus.

1030
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:50,985
Marty, what are you doing here?

1031
01:28:51,025 --> 01:28:54,427
Come on, Stella.
You know why I'm here.

1032
01:28:54,462 --> 01:28:56,453
No, I don't.

1033
01:28:58,099 --> 01:29:01,000
You're not coming in.
You are not coming in.

1034
01:29:01,035 --> 01:29:02,196
Mam!-

1035
01:29:04,806 --> 01:29:07,036
You know,
I've been working hard lately.

1036
01:29:07,075 --> 01:29:12,411
Yeah. Trying to write,
trying to create...

1037
01:29:12,447 --> 01:29:14,245
trying not to think about you.

1038
01:29:14,282 --> 01:29:16,341
Go home, Marty, now.

1039
01:29:16,384 --> 01:29:18,284
- No.
- Oh...

1040
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:21,653
- Come here.
- Don't do this to me.

1041
01:29:25,393 --> 01:29:28,021
I'm thinking about
the way that it was.

1042
01:29:28,062 --> 01:29:29,655
I want it back.

1043
01:29:29,697 --> 01:29:31,290
What?

1044
01:29:31,332 --> 01:29:33,061
Wait, wait, wait.

1045
01:29:33,101 --> 01:29:36,036
Oh, oh, oh.

1046
01:29:36,070 --> 01:29:37,902
Oh, that's great.

1047
01:29:37,939 --> 01:29:40,499
Now you're a goddamn sniper.

1048
01:29:40,541 --> 01:29:42,031
- Marty?
- Yes.

1049
01:29:42,076 --> 01:29:44,374
You clear your ass
out of here now.

1050
01:30:10,037 --> 01:30:12,335
What if I said that I loved you?

1051
01:30:14,442 --> 01:30:17,707
I'd look for a sign, Harry.

1052
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:21,409
But not what
I've been seeing lately.

1053
01:30:21,449 --> 01:30:25,215
I'd look for some tenderness...

1054
01:30:26,788 --> 01:30:28,654
sincerity.

1055
01:30:30,291 --> 01:30:31,656
A sign?

1056
01:30:34,061 --> 01:30:36,655
What about a whole billboard?

1057
01:30:40,101 --> 01:30:42,900
And how did you find out
where I lived?

1058
01:30:42,937 --> 01:30:46,100
Like I said once before,
I'm very good at what I do.

1059
01:30:50,578 --> 01:30:53,445
And what are you doing now?

1060
01:30:53,481 --> 01:30:58,920
Well, I was on a case, but
I was following the wrong guy...

1061
01:30:58,953 --> 01:31:01,047
because the beautiful lady
who hired me...

1062
01:31:01,088 --> 01:31:03,250
was doing the same thing.

1063
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:06,727
So, I put her on the train...

1064
01:31:06,761 --> 01:31:10,664
and she kissed me,
and it felt good...

1065
01:31:10,698 --> 01:31:13,690
but not like the kind
that you keep.

1066
01:31:15,303 --> 01:31:18,466
And then I saw you
kissing this guy...

1067
01:31:18,506 --> 01:31:22,204
and I felt real tight inside.

1068
01:31:23,277 --> 01:31:26,110
Until I realized...

1069
01:31:26,147 --> 01:31:28,639
you were solving your case, too.

1070
01:31:34,555 --> 01:31:36,148
Good.

1071
01:31:37,258 --> 01:31:39,386
So, what do we do now?

1072
01:31:39,427 --> 01:31:41,259
What do you think?

1073
01:31:41,295 --> 01:31:43,161
Right.

1074
01:31:57,278 --> 01:32:00,509
Think it'll last, Stella?

1075
01:32:00,548 --> 01:32:02,812
I don't know, Harry.

1076
01:32:04,485 --> 01:32:08,319
I guess there's only
one way to find out.
