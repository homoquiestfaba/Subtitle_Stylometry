00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:21,066
from a long time ago.

179
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,568
I can explain that.

180
00:13:22,651 --> 00:13:25,195
No, you needn't.

181
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,574
You think you're the first
my ex-husband sent?

182
00:13:28,657 --> 00:13:29,658
[scoffs]

183
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:33,329
The first one is in jail.

184
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,748
Beastly man
with no manners.

185
00:13:36,832 --> 00:13:39,209
The second
was more amiable.

186
00:13:41,545 --> 00:13:43,756
Couldn't find Rafo and left.

187
00:13:45,507 --> 00:13:48,177
Tell me, cowboy,

188
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,680
why does his father
really want him now?

189
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:54,558
He has no real love
for the boy.

190
00:13:54,642 --> 00:13:57,895
Well, maybe he's trying
to change all that.

191
00:13:57,978 --> 00:14:01,565
You're picturing
some innocent kid.

192
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:04,568
[chuckles]
Like in that photo.

193
00:14:04,652 --> 00:14:05,903
A nice, respectful boy

194
00:14:05,986 --> 00:14:08,530
who wears clean clothes
to school,

195
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:11,325
and sings in church.
[chuckles]

196
00:14:12,576 --> 00:14:15,329
I guarantee you
that isn't the case.

197
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,208
My son is wild.

198
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,294
An animal
who lives in the gutter.

199
00:14:22,378 --> 00:14:27,049
Gambling, stealing,
cockfighting, at the...

200
00:14:28,175 --> 00:14:30,094
At the<i> calle Choca.</i>

201
00:14:32,763 --> 00:14:34,598
Take him.

202
00:14:34,682 --> 00:14:36,975
Take him
if you can find him.

203
00:14:37,768 --> 00:14:39,728
He's a monster.

204
00:14:41,855 --> 00:14:45,234
You have made a long trip
for nothing.

205
00:14:48,404 --> 00:14:51,240
I don't know
where my son is now.

206
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:53,575
He's like his father.

207
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,994
He runs away.

208
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:59,206
He hates his father.

209
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:01,125
He hates me.

210
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,921
So, go home, Mr. Mike.

211
00:15:07,297 --> 00:15:08,507
Go home.

212
00:15:10,384 --> 00:15:12,219
When did you give up?

213
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,141
No matter what people say,

214
00:15:17,224 --> 00:15:19,727
some aren't cut out
to be parents.

215
00:15:25,274 --> 00:15:27,526
Have a drink with me, hmm?

216
00:15:27,609 --> 00:15:28,652
[snaps fingers]

217
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:32,740
-[bottle cap opens]

218
00:15:32,823 --> 00:15:33,907
[drink pours]

219
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,997
No, I got a job to do.

220
00:15:41,415 --> 00:15:45,544
Well, then, good luck.
You'll need it.

221
00:15:48,297 --> 00:15:49,715
[footsteps receding]

222
00:16:04,104 --> 00:16:05,856
[indistinct chatter
in Spanish]

223
00:16:07,816 --> 00:16:09,193
[lively music playing]

224
00:16:10,068 --> 00:16:11,111
[speaks Spanish]

225
00:16:13,155 --> 00:16:15,115
[people cheering in distance]

226
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:22,623
[indistinct chatter
in Spanish]

227
00:16:27,211 --> 00:16:29,004
[chicken clucking]

228
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:32,591
Hey, Rafo.

229
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:45,854
[crowd continues cheering]

230
00:16:47,356 --> 00:16:49,066
[chickens clucking]

231
00:16:54,363 --> 00:16:56,532
[police sirens blaring]

232
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:57,908
[officer speaking Spanish
over loudspeaker]

233
00:16:57,991 --> 00:16:59,076
[in English] Oh, shit!

234
00:17:00,118 --> 00:17:01,328
Shit, shit.

235
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:05,707
[clamoring]

236
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:19,054
[car engine starts]

237
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:20,430
[police siren chirps faintly]

238
00:17:21,557 --> 00:17:23,433
[car drives away]

239
00:17:34,611 --> 00:17:36,071
Hey, Rafo,
you can come out now.

240
00:17:36,154 --> 00:17:37,531
The cops are gone.

241
00:17:39,199 --> 00:17:41,243
Where the hell are you?

242
00:17:46,748 --> 00:17:48,250
You can come out now.

243
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,168
I'm a friend of the family.

244
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:52,254
[clucking]

245
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:55,757
Okay. Come on.

246
00:17:56,425 --> 00:17:57,467
Come here.

247
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,012
Hey, hey, come on.

248
00:18:00,095 --> 00:18:02,347
Chicken... [mutters]

249
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:04,641
Bad chicken.
No, no! Hey, hey!

250
00:18:04,725 --> 00:18:05,767
Ah.

251
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:10,147
All right,
you little bastard.

252
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,857
Come on out.

253
00:18:12,649 --> 00:18:15,110
I'm gonna count to five.

254
00:18:15,193 --> 00:18:17,487
I'm gonna
wring this chicken's neck.

255
00:18:18,488 --> 00:18:19,990
You got that?

256
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:22,117
One.

257
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,535
Two.

258
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:25,037
Three.

259
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,496
Four.

260
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,707
-Give me my rooster!
-Five.

261
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,501
Not until we talk, Rafo.

262
00:18:31,585 --> 00:18:32,836
You know my name?

263
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,005
How did you find me?

264
00:18:35,088 --> 00:18:36,924
I found you
because your mother told me

265
00:18:37,007 --> 00:18:38,800
where you were.
That's why.

266
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:42,429
If she sold me to you,
you're a fool.

267
00:18:42,512 --> 00:18:45,015
Touch me and I'll kick
your ass, old man.

268
00:18:45,098 --> 00:18:46,683
What the hell
you talking about?

269
00:18:46,767 --> 00:18:48,894
You are some perverted friend
of my mother

270
00:18:48,977 --> 00:18:50,938
from one of her parties.

271
00:18:51,021 --> 00:18:52,814
Perverted old man.

272
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:56,151
Hey. You're talking
to the wrong person.

273
00:18:56,234 --> 00:18:59,821
I'm here representing your dad
who wants to see you.

274
00:19:01,156 --> 00:19:02,199
Howard Polk.

275
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:06,328
I work for him, that's all.

276
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:09,289
You are a cowboy?
A ranch hand?

277
00:19:10,165 --> 00:19:11,375
Yeah.

278
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:14,878
That's right.
I've done a little of that.

279
00:19:15,837 --> 00:19:18,090
Okay, talk.

280
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,967
Not here.

281
00:19:21,176 --> 00:19:22,302
Not here.

282
00:19:29,351 --> 00:19:30,686
You're joking, yes?

283
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:33,105
No, not joking.

284
00:19:33,188 --> 00:19:35,649
My father, he wants me.

285
00:19:35,732 --> 00:19:37,609
Well, you're his only kid.

286
00:19:37,693 --> 00:19:40,070
[scoffs]
And he sent you for me?

287
00:19:40,153 --> 00:19:41,238
Yep.

288
00:19:41,321 --> 00:19:42,364
You're a liar.

289
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:45,200
My father hasn't seen me
for years.

290
00:19:45,283 --> 00:19:47,452
Why does he want
to see me now?

291
00:19:47,536 --> 00:19:50,038
Well, he wants to see you,
that's all.

292
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:52,416
He, uh... He misses you.

293
00:19:52,499 --> 00:19:54,084
[scoffs, chuckles]

294
00:19:54,167 --> 00:19:55,836
You're full of shit.

295
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,212
My father doesn't want me.

296
00:19:57,295 --> 00:19:58,964
He never even called
on my birthdays.

297
00:19:59,047 --> 00:20:00,090
Look at that.

298
00:20:02,884 --> 00:20:04,261
It's me when I was little.

299
00:20:04,344 --> 00:20:06,555
Yeah, that's it.

300
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:07,973
Same guy.

301
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:10,225
He gave you that?

302
00:20:10,308 --> 00:20:11,309
He did.

303
00:20:12,686 --> 00:20:17,232
If my father wants me back,
why didn't he telephone?

304
00:20:17,315 --> 00:20:19,860
He sent you,
some<i> apestoso viejo.</i>

305
00:20:19,943 --> 00:20:23,697
I don't know what that means,
but I don't like it.

306
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,073
When I was little,

307
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:27,701
my father said he would
give me a special horse.

308
00:20:30,704 --> 00:20:31,997
He never did.

309
00:20:33,373 --> 00:20:35,083
He's a liar.

310
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:37,085
Eh, just a little late,
that's all.

311
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:38,920
That doesn't mean he's a liar.

312
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,381
But he's gonna
make it up to you now.

313
00:20:41,465 --> 00:20:42,966
He's got a big ranch.

314
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:44,801
He's got horses, cattle.

315
00:20:44,885 --> 00:20:46,428
In fact,
he's got hundreds of horses.

316
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:48,805
You'll be able
to ride yourself silly.

317
00:20:48,889 --> 00:20:50,807
-Hundreds of horses?
-Yeah.

318
00:20:50,891 --> 00:20:53,351
Even owns a rodeo up there.

319
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:56,104
Rodeo?

320
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:57,773
Hundreds of horses...

321
00:20:58,398 --> 00:20:59,775
He's a big boss!

322
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:02,736
Yeah, he's a big boss.
That's what I'm telling you.

323
00:21:02,819 --> 00:21:03,820
Maybe I'll go.

324
00:21:03,904 --> 00:21:04,946
-Just for a while.
-Yeah.

325
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,615
Good. Good, I think so.

326
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,325
If I don't like it,
I will say,

327
00:21:08,408 --> 00:21:09,618
"To hell with him,"
and come back.

328
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:11,078
Yeah, that's right.

329
00:21:11,161 --> 00:21:13,413
If you don't like it,
to hell with it.

330
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,500
Okay. Deal.

331
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:17,918
I can bring my rooster?

332
00:21:18,001 --> 00:21:20,253
Yeah. I don't see why not.

333
00:21:21,004 --> 00:21:22,506
Hey, Macho, come.

334
00:21:24,925 --> 00:21:25,967
Where ya going?

335
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:27,469
I have to get my things.

336
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:29,471
No, stay here.

337
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:31,056
[indistinct
police radio chatter]

338
00:21:32,682 --> 00:21:33,725
Shit.

339
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:00,752

[humming]

342
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:14,683
[in English] What can I say?

343
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:17,644
I can't believe it.

344
00:22:18,895 --> 00:22:20,522
Where did you find him?

345
00:22:21,648 --> 00:22:23,358
Right where you said.

346
00:22:23,441 --> 00:22:25,360
At the cock fights.

347
00:22:25,443 --> 00:22:26,862
[scoffs]

348
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:29,239
And where is he?

349
00:22:29,322 --> 00:22:32,033
He said he was gonna go out
and get his stuff.

350
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:33,201
[laughs]

351
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:34,870
You poor fool.

352
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:36,037
[speaking Spanish]

353
00:22:37,455 --> 00:22:39,374
-[Mike in English] Yeah.
-[laughing]

354
00:22:39,457 --> 00:22:41,001
-Ah.
-[Mike] Well...

355
00:22:41,084 --> 00:22:42,919
This time...

356
00:22:43,003 --> 00:22:45,755
This time
you'll have a drink with me.

357
00:22:52,554 --> 00:22:56,516
Ah... you really thought
Rafo would go with you, hmm?

358
00:22:57,976 --> 00:22:59,519
Mm, maybe he will.

359
00:23:02,564 --> 00:23:03,607

Otherwise, this job
ain't gonna be finished.

Hey, I'm talking to you.
Don't go!

One more step

00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:33,071
I'll call the<i> Federales</i>

Give them your name,

the rest of your life

He's my property,
and nobody takes my property.

His father ran away from us.

but he left us here.

00:32:00,643 --> 00:32:02,061
Yeah, rodeo.

541
00:32:02,145 --> 00:32:03,980
Working on ranches

542
00:32:04,063 --> 00:32:07,942
and working with horses
and stuff especially.

543
00:32:08,025 --> 00:32:10,528
Well, so I think
he'll be fine.

544
00:32:11,738 --> 00:32:14,240
Macho. His name is Macho.

545
00:32:15,032 --> 00:32:16,743
Whatever.

546
00:32:16,826 --> 00:32:18,578
What's wrong with that?

547
00:32:18,661 --> 00:32:19,787
Nothing.

548
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:22,665
Guy wants to name
his cock "Macho"...

549
00:32:22,749 --> 00:32:25,168
[chuckles] It's okay by me.

550
00:32:26,836 --> 00:32:29,338
He's macho, like me.

551
00:32:29,422 --> 00:32:31,048
Very strong rooster.

552
00:32:31,132 --> 00:32:32,508
Everyone wants him.

553
00:32:32,592 --> 00:32:34,802
One even stole him from me.

554
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:38,848
Yeah, your mother says you've
stolen a few things yourself.

555
00:32:38,931 --> 00:32:40,558
Cars and such.

556
00:32:40,641 --> 00:32:43,811
When we get up in the States,
you touch a man's vehicle,

557
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:46,189
that doesn't go over.

558
00:32:46,272 --> 00:32:49,901
Yeah. I'll remember
when we get to Texas.

559
00:32:49,984 --> 00:32:51,569
Especially in Texas.

560
00:32:51,652 --> 00:32:56,073
{\an5}And you can watch
all that "macho" crap
up there too.

561
00:32:56,157 --> 00:32:58,284
Nobody likes that stuff.

562
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:12,507
How'd you get the bruises?

563
00:33:15,843 --> 00:33:18,513
Being on the street
cause all that?

564
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:21,140
Sometimes.

565
00:33:22,725 --> 00:33:27,522
{\an5}And sometimes
when I go home,
it's worse.

566
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:30,775
That's why I stay
on the streets.

567
00:33:30,858 --> 00:33:33,027
All the bad stuff
happens at home.

568
00:33:37,573 --> 00:33:39,659
My mom hates me.

569
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:44,455
You want to know why?

570
00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:46,165
Not really.

571
00:33:47,583 --> 00:33:50,211
She bring home
a strange man today,

572
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:52,713
another strange man tomorrow,

573
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:55,341
and she said
I should call them "Uncle."

574
00:33:55,424 --> 00:33:57,885
And I say to her,

575
00:33:57,969 --> 00:34:00,137
"How many men
can I call 'Uncle'?"

576
00:34:01,264 --> 00:34:03,808
So, she hates me.

577
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,602
And Aurelio,

578
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:09,272
he was in prison.

579
00:34:09,355 --> 00:34:13,317
Sometimes he sells drugs
and brings her pills and dope.

580
00:34:15,194 --> 00:34:18,072
One time I spit on him.

581
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:20,700
He hits me
to teach me manners

582
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:23,202
and I said to him...

583
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:25,788
[swears in Spanish]

584
00:34:25,872 --> 00:34:27,415
[in English]
"Don't teach me manners

585
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:30,960
{\an5}when you're in bed
with my mom,
where she sleep."

586
00:34:31,043 --> 00:34:34,255
So, I say, to hell with that.

587
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:37,300
I make a few pesos
with Macho for myself

588
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,178
and I do what I want.

589
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,348
On the street,

590
00:34:44,432 --> 00:34:46,100
I trust no one.

591
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:49,478
But it's safer than at home.

592
00:34:57,486 --> 00:35:00,281
You can never trust no one.

[Mike] We're gonna take

<i>-Federales</i> are there.
-Oh, shit.

600
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:45,743
We gotta go down this road.

00:35:45,826 --> 00:35:47,078
[Rafo] What do they want?

602
00:35:47,161 --> 00:35:48,955
[Mike] Well, they probably
wanted you.

603
00:35:50,373 --> 00:35:51,791
We'll stay away from them.

with them.

No good.
It's bump, bump, bump.

Anyway...

he's not the sheriff.
He's a deputy.

1077
01:08:17,151 --> 01:08:19,278
<i>But two goddamn weeks?</i>
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1078
01:08:19,361 --> 01:08:21,780
{\an5}[Mike] I told you
it was gonna
take a little while.

1079
01:08:21,864 --> 01:08:23,449
I heard that already.

1080
01:08:23,532 --> 01:08:25,868
Just keep telling him
what he wants to hear.

1081
01:08:25,951 --> 01:08:27,411
-Who?
-[Howard]<i> "Who?"</i>

1082
01:08:27,494 --> 01:08:30,164
The kid. Rafael.

1083
01:08:31,081 --> 01:08:32,291
Just keep him happy,

1084
01:08:32,374 --> 01:08:33,626
and whatever you do,

1085
01:08:33,709 --> 01:08:35,294
do not let his mother
get a hold of him.

1086
01:08:35,377 --> 01:08:37,713
<i>Or her lawyers</i>
<i>will never respond.</i>

1087
01:08:37,796 --> 01:08:39,131
Respond to what?

1088
01:08:39,214 --> 01:08:40,883
[Howard]<i> It's a business thing.</i>

1089
01:08:40,966 --> 01:08:42,468
A few years ago,
down there in Mexico,

1090
01:08:42,551 --> 01:08:44,720
I invested in some property
in her name

1091
01:08:44,803 --> 01:08:46,972
to avoid their goddamn taxes,

1092
01:08:47,056 --> 01:08:49,725
and now those investments
have matured.

1093
01:08:49,808 --> 01:08:51,977
So I want the return
on my investment.

1094
01:08:52,061 --> 01:08:53,479
[Mike] Just like the kid.

1095
01:08:53,562 --> 01:08:55,522
{\an5}[Howard]
<i>Well, yeah, okay.</i>
<i>So, you get it.</i>

1096
01:08:55,606 --> 01:08:56,732
[Mike] Mm-hmm.

1097
01:08:56,815 --> 01:08:58,984
I get it.
You played me, you bastard.

1098
01:08:59,068 --> 01:09:00,319
I didn't play you.

1099
01:09:00,402 --> 01:09:02,655
What are you,
eight years old, Mike?

1100
01:09:03,239 --> 01:09:04,281
Jesus!

1101
01:09:04,365 --> 01:09:06,700
If I have something
she wants,

1102
01:09:06,784 --> 01:09:08,869
<i>maybe she'll negotiate.</i>

1103
01:09:08,953 --> 01:09:11,288
Christ, I'm a reasonable man.

1104
01:09:11,372 --> 01:09:13,666
I'm just asking for my half.

1105
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:16,502
This kid would be better off
without either one of you.

1106
01:09:16,585 --> 01:09:17,920
Well, you know what?

1107
01:09:18,003 --> 01:09:19,338
It doesn't make a shit
what you think, Mike.

1108
01:09:19,421 --> 01:09:21,173
I'm his father

1109
01:09:21,257 --> 01:09:24,051
and I actually
want him back.

1110
01:09:24,134 --> 01:09:27,888
<i>This isn't all about</i>
<i>the money, okay?</i>

1111
01:09:27,972 --> 01:09:29,556
The kid's my son.

1112
01:09:30,599 --> 01:09:31,976
So, please...

1113
01:09:33,185 --> 01:09:35,854
Please, can you stick
to the plan?

1114
01:09:35,938 --> 01:09:37,815
Just meet me at the border
with him.

1115
01:09:39,525 --> 01:09:40,526
Yeah.

1116
01:09:43,862 --> 01:09:45,322
[indistinct chatter]

1117
01:09:55,833 --> 01:09:57,001
Was that my father?

1118
01:09:57,084 --> 01:09:58,377
Yeah, it was, kid.

1119
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:00,087
[Rafo] Did he say anything
about me?

1120
01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:01,714
Ask how I am?

1121
01:10:01,797 --> 01:10:05,092
Well, he did, yeah. He...
He wants the best for ya.

1122
01:10:05,175 --> 01:10:07,386
-He does?
-[Mike] Yeah.

1123
01:10:07,469 --> 01:10:09,930
He still wants me?
He still wants me to come?

1124
01:10:10,014 --> 01:10:12,349
'Course he does, kid.
Why wouldn't he?

1125
01:10:16,103 --> 01:10:17,354
[horse snorting]

1126
01:10:17,438 --> 01:10:19,732
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
Give me that.

1127
01:10:20,816 --> 01:10:23,235
Okay, come on, there.

1128
01:10:23,319 --> 01:10:24,611
Right through there.

1129
01:10:24,695 --> 01:10:27,448
Stick your head in there,
and put it on up here.

1130
01:10:28,657 --> 01:10:30,826
Put this here. Okay.

1131
01:10:31,994 --> 01:10:33,120
We got him.

1132
01:10:33,203 --> 01:10:35,789
Now, that was the easy part.

1133
01:10:35,873 --> 01:10:38,125
-That was the easy part?
-[Mike] Yeah.

1134
01:10:38,208 --> 01:10:41,253
Next, they don't like it
when you cinch the girth.

1135
01:10:42,254 --> 01:10:43,672
It's just like this.

1136
01:10:43,756 --> 01:10:45,716
You just have to pull,
cinch it up.

1137
01:10:45,799 --> 01:10:46,925
You can do it.

1138
01:10:47,009 --> 01:10:48,594
-You wanna try it?
-[Rafo] Okay.

1139
01:10:48,677 --> 01:10:51,764
{\an5}Just cinch it up,
and put up half of...
An eighth of it.

-[horse whinnies]
-[Rafo] Whoa! Whoa.

1141
01:10:57,519 --> 01:10:58,771
Whoa.

1142
01:10:58,854 --> 01:11:00,522
Whoa! He's so wild.

1143
01:11:00,606 --> 01:11:03,150
[Mike] Okay, yeah.
Take it easy.

1144
01:11:03,233 --> 01:11:04,985
[soothingly] Hey, hey. Hey.

1145
01:11:13,368 --> 01:11:14,953
How did you do that?

1146
01:11:15,746 --> 01:11:17,664
We did it, partner.

1147
01:11:17,748 --> 01:11:18,957
We did it.

No.

We can't do that.
Can't do that.

1159

We've already
imposed on her enough.

-And she already...
-Right.

...cleaned it out for us.

[Mike] It's no.

But what do we do
when we leave?

1175
01:12:50,132 --> 01:12:53,510
We get ourselves another car,

when we talked.

1340
01:25:31,267 --> 01:25:33,019
It's about your dad.

Yeah, I mean,

01:25:35,647 --> 01:25:37,357
{\an5}he wants you
to come be with him
and everything,

1343

but there's another reason.

1344
01:25:38,775 --> 01:25:40,234
And that's 'cause
your mother and he

1345

have some investments
together.

1346
01:25:42,153 --> 01:25:45,239

of all the investments.
