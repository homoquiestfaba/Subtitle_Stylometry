-Sam, they're here.
-[Sam] Yeah. Be right out.

[man 1] Hey let's go, Sam!

12
00:02:10,913 --> 00:02:12,654
[man 2] Yeah, let's go!

13
00:02:12,697 --> 00:02:17,572
[people cheering and applauding]

14
00:02:17,615 --> 00:02:19,356
Delayed flight.
He feels terrible.

15
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,618
[Sam]
What does that mean for us?

16
00:02:20,662 --> 00:02:22,185
He doesn't have all afternoon.

17
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:23,839
He's got early flight
this evening.

18
00:02:23,882 --> 00:02:25,623
There's some bubblegum chewer
in North Dakota.

19
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:27,582
-All right, we'll get it done.
-His name's Alec.

20
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,846
-[Sam] Hey, Alec. Sam.
-Pleasure to meet you.

21
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:33,240
-I am so sorry I'm late.
-[Sam] Don't worry about it.

22
00:02:33,283 --> 00:02:34,893
We'll have you out of here
in no time.

23
00:02:34,937 --> 00:02:36,286
Thanks, Blake. Good looking out.

24
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,896
Wish these things
weren't so fast,

25
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,029
but be assured,
my focus is on you today.

26
00:02:40,072 --> 00:02:42,423
We are so glad
to be here to witness it.

27
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:44,251
Thank you for involving us
in your world records.

28
00:02:44,294 --> 00:02:45,904
[exhales] All Shane.

29
00:02:45,948 --> 00:02:47,471
Oh, I don't know about all that.

30
00:02:47,515 --> 00:02:49,256
It's good to see
how we do under pressure.

31
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:51,171
My unofficial manager.

32
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,609
Hey look, I want
to get this on our social.

33
00:02:54,652 --> 00:02:55,827
-You good with that?
-Sure.

34
00:02:55,871 --> 00:02:56,959
[Shane] All right, cool.

35
00:02:58,134 --> 00:03:00,136
Hey, everybody,
it's your main man, Shane,

36
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,399
live here at my gym, the RCC,

37
00:03:02,443 --> 00:03:04,314
and I'm with the incomparable
Sam Johnson

38
00:03:04,358 --> 00:03:06,403
and the World Record
Federation today.

39
00:03:06,447 --> 00:03:08,492
-Give a shout out, guys.
-Hey guys.

40
00:03:08,536 --> 00:03:10,625
Getting ready
to break some records, right?

41
00:03:10,668 --> 00:03:12,061
That's what we're here for.

42
00:03:12,104 --> 00:03:13,628
That's right, we're going to
shatter them right here.

43
00:03:13,671 --> 00:03:15,543
We're going to get at it
at the top of the hour,

44
00:03:15,586 --> 00:03:17,066
so check back in with us.

45
00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:18,850
-[man] You okay if I start?
-Yes.

46
00:03:18,894 --> 00:03:21,592
[Alec] I just have a few
paperwork items to go over.

47
00:03:21,636 --> 00:03:24,029
Make sure we have the correct
names and exercises listed.

48
00:03:24,073 --> 00:03:26,249
Your full name
is Samantha Aiden Johnson,

49
00:03:26,293 --> 00:03:28,077
-is that correct?
-Yeah.

50
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,426
Love the name Aiden.

51
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,298
Thanks. It's my dad's.

52
00:03:31,341 --> 00:03:33,300
I bet he's really excited
to hear about this today.

53
00:03:33,343 --> 00:03:36,564
Uh, he actually
passed away last year.

54
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:38,957
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-Don't worry about it.

55
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,656
You know,
one of the perks of my job

56
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:43,005
is that I really
get to learn about

57
00:03:43,048 --> 00:03:44,920
some interesting and new things.

58
00:03:44,963 --> 00:03:47,662
Uh, a lot of crazy things, too,
but I won't get into that.

59
00:03:47,705 --> 00:03:50,186
Uh, but I've really enjoyed
getting to know your sport.

60
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,361
How long have you been doing it?

61
00:03:51,405 --> 00:03:53,015
[Sam] About four years now.

62
00:03:53,058 --> 00:03:54,364
And were you an athlete
before or something?

63
00:03:54,408 --> 00:03:55,844
[Sam] Uh, gymnastics growing up,

64
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:57,367
-some bodybuilding.
-That's awesome.

65
00:03:57,411 --> 00:03:59,108
[Shane] Let me
sort out the details.

66
00:03:59,151 --> 00:04:01,241
I got this.
Sam, stay in the headspace.

67
00:04:01,284 --> 00:04:02,590
We have to lock in soon.
All right?

68
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:04,244
I'll let you know
if you need to sign anything.

69
00:04:04,287 --> 00:04:05,375
-All right.
-Okay.

70
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:07,029
[Alec] Thank you.

71
00:04:07,072 --> 00:04:09,423
-I didn't mean--
-It's fine. You didn't know.

72
00:04:09,466 --> 00:04:11,729
-Were they close?
-Oh, yeah, very.

73
00:04:11,773 --> 00:04:13,557
But she's good.
She's ready for this.

74
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:15,080
-All right. What do you got?
-Just right here.

75
00:04:15,124 --> 00:04:16,386
All right.

76
00:04:18,345 --> 00:04:19,737
-[Sam] Hey.
-[Monica] Hey.

77
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:21,217
-Can I pass this to you?
-[Monica] Yeah.

78
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,089
How was class this morning?

79
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:26,004
[sighs]
Brutal as always, you know.

80
00:04:26,614 --> 00:04:27,745
How are you feeling
about this one?

81
00:04:29,138 --> 00:04:31,096
-We'll see. [chuckles]
-Oh, you got it.

82
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,317
[Sam] Do you have to?

83
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:35,666
I'm getting
a free month out of this,

84
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,277
so I'm getting it all.

85
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,279
[Sam] Just a month?

86
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:41,150
[Monica] So this is the one,
over 1,800 pounds in a minute?

87
00:04:41,672 --> 00:04:42,934
How many reps
are you trying to do?

88
00:04:42,978 --> 00:04:44,371
Ten.

89
00:04:44,414 --> 00:04:46,024
-Where does this one fit?
-Less.

90
00:04:46,068 --> 00:04:48,592
Is it still five movements
in 30 minutes?

91
00:04:48,636 --> 00:04:50,507
-[Sam] That's the goal.
-Okay.

92
00:04:50,551 --> 00:04:52,509
I told her she should try
and get some money out of this.

93
00:04:52,553 --> 00:04:54,990
Yeah, she at least talked to
Shane about a free membership.

94
00:04:55,033 --> 00:04:56,426
And for, like, a year.

95
00:04:57,775 --> 00:04:59,299
It's a mock competition.

96
00:04:59,864 --> 00:05:02,084
Just testing my limits.

97
00:05:02,127 --> 00:05:04,826
Yeah, come on, Sam,
what do you get out of this?

98
00:05:04,869 --> 00:05:06,306
You get a sponsorship
with someone?

99
00:05:06,871 --> 00:05:08,569
No way. I want in.

100
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:10,788
I don't want to jinx it.

101
00:05:10,832 --> 00:05:12,529
Plus, you didn't train
a lot harder.

102
00:05:12,573 --> 00:05:14,488
That's low, man.

103
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,359
This is going to be awesome.

104
00:05:16,968 --> 00:05:18,579
You know, you guys
don't have to stay for this.

105
00:05:18,622 --> 00:05:20,276
-Well it's too late now.
-I wouldn't miss this.

106
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,756
-[Sam chuckles] Thanks.
-[cellphone rings]

107
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:23,975
-Oh, hey.
-Oh, thanks.

108
00:05:24,585 --> 00:05:25,803
Mom.

109
00:05:27,675 --> 00:05:29,590
[phone chimes]

110
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:32,419
-Hey, Mom.
-There she is!

111
00:05:32,462 --> 00:05:34,986
My baby, the record breaker.

112
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,684
[scoffs] We haven't started yet.

113
00:05:36,727 --> 00:05:37,815
[Sam's mom]
You haven't?

114
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:40,165
Late start. Pretty soon, though.

115
00:05:40,688 --> 00:05:41,732
-[woman] Good luck, Sam.
-Thanks.

116
00:05:41,776 --> 00:05:42,951
[Sam's mom]
Are you still warmed up?

117
00:05:44,082 --> 00:05:45,388
Yeah.

118
00:05:45,432 --> 00:05:47,956
Oh, hey. Look what I found.

119
00:05:48,957 --> 00:05:50,785
Did you go through
my box of things?

120
00:05:50,828 --> 00:05:53,396
Things? These are not things.

121
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,180
And yes. Yes, I did.

122
00:05:55,224 --> 00:05:56,530
If I can't be there,
then I want to remember

123
00:05:56,573 --> 00:05:58,793
all the other records you broke.

124
00:05:58,836 --> 00:06:02,187
-Oh, my gosh.
-I am so proud of you.

125
00:06:02,231 --> 00:06:04,059
Everything you pushed through
this year.

126
00:06:04,102 --> 00:06:05,452
I know your dad is, too.

127
00:06:05,495 --> 00:06:08,237
He is smiling on you.

128
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,413
-Yeah.
-[Sam's mom] No, he is.

129
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,851
Uh, got a call
with a new sponsor.

130
00:06:15,244 --> 00:06:17,551
Should, uh, open some doors
if I can do this,

131
00:06:17,594 --> 00:06:19,161
Maybe bring in a little money,

132
00:06:19,204 --> 00:06:20,554
at least help with comp fees.

133
00:06:20,597 --> 00:06:22,643
-That's good, right?
-Yeah.

134
00:06:22,686 --> 00:06:25,776
It's not official yet,
but it should be soon.

135
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,995
Good for you.

136
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:28,388
You put that money to good use.

137
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,826
Is Charlie there?

138
00:06:33,871 --> 00:06:35,743
-No.
-Hmm.

139
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,747
I understand.

140
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,836
But you know what?
I will be your lifeline.

141
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,359
If you need anything,
just call me.

142
00:06:43,838 --> 00:06:45,666
Will do.

143
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:47,624
Your dad would say,

144
00:06:47,668 --> 00:06:49,191
-"Go break some records."
-"Go break some records."

145
00:06:49,887 --> 00:06:51,715
Yeah. Thanks, Mom.

146
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,977
-Love you.
-I love you.

147
00:06:53,021 --> 00:06:54,109
Bye.

148
00:06:58,679 --> 00:07:01,725

[upbeat music plays]

153
00:07:43,985 --> 00:07:45,508
Looks like
you haven't started yet.

154
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:48,685
Cool.

155
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:50,034
Cool, I'm glad I didn't miss it.

156
00:07:51,688 --> 00:07:54,691
Um, you're looking good,
you're looking ready.

157
00:07:54,735 --> 00:07:58,956
[music plays faintly
on speakers]

158
00:08:01,002 --> 00:08:02,960
[Sam sniffs, sighs]

159
00:08:05,746 --> 00:08:06,877
[Charlie sighs]

160
00:08:10,707 --> 00:08:12,274
-What?
-[Sam scoffs]

161
00:08:14,537 --> 00:08:16,757
Do you remember
the last thing you said to me?

162
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,803
How about,
"Hey, thanks for coming."

163
00:08:20,674 --> 00:08:22,589
How about, "Hey,
I didn't mean what I said."

164
00:08:23,938 --> 00:08:26,244
The only reason you're here
is to save face.

165
00:08:26,288 --> 00:08:28,725
-I'm not here to save face.
-Okay.

166
00:08:31,467 --> 00:08:32,990
I thought
you'd be done by now, but--

167
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:35,950
[clicks tongue]
Uh, cool. You know?

168
00:08:35,993 --> 00:08:37,995
You got this.
You can totally do this.

169
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,867
-Oh, permission.
-I'm just saying--

170
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,172
If you wanted to talk,

171
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:42,609
you should have called me back.

172
00:08:43,871 --> 00:08:45,829
Why are you doing this now?
Like nothing's going on.

173
00:08:45,873 --> 00:08:48,484
-I've been texting you.
-You know I hate texting.

174
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,790
What do you want me to do, Sam?

175
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,443
We don't live together anymore.

176
00:08:51,487 --> 00:08:53,358
We cannot pick this up
where we left off.

177
00:08:53,402 --> 00:08:54,577
-I'm just trying--
-[Sam] No.

178
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:57,101
Hey, Charlie. How you've been?

179
00:08:57,711 --> 00:08:59,364
-Sam, you good?
-Yeah. Okay.

180
00:08:59,408 --> 00:09:00,757
All right, a few more minutes.

181
00:09:00,801 --> 00:09:02,019
I'm going to need
your signatures.

182
00:09:02,063 --> 00:09:03,630
Okay, yeah.

183
00:09:03,673 --> 00:09:04,935
-Be there in a sec.
-[Shane] All right.

184
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:06,937
Oh, and I like the adjudicator.

185
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:09,113
He wants to review
a few things when you're ready.

186
00:09:09,157 --> 00:09:11,594
Okay. Yeah,
I'll be over in a minute.

187
00:09:11,638 --> 00:09:13,161
All right. We're getting close.

188
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:24,346
You never get Fridays off.

189
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,569
Yeah, well...

190
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,788
I did today.

191
00:09:36,184 --> 00:09:37,881
But I'll go if you want me to.

192
00:09:41,668 --> 00:09:42,756
Do what you want.

193
00:09:43,974 --> 00:09:47,064
Look, your dad would want you
to have all the support.

194
00:09:48,283 --> 00:09:50,111
[sighs] I want to stay.

195
00:09:50,981 --> 00:09:52,069
Cheer you on.

196
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,507
So, are you here for me or him?

197
00:09:57,118 --> 00:09:58,946
Sam. Signatures.

198
00:10:04,212 --> 00:10:07,215
Here and here. Make it official.

199
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,392
Bye, Sam. Good luck!

200
00:10:10,435 --> 00:10:11,872
-Good luck, Sam.
-[woman] See ya.

201
00:10:11,915 --> 00:10:13,395
-Good luck, Sam.
-Thanks, man. See ya.

202
00:10:13,438 --> 00:10:15,049
Did you give him paperwork?

203
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:16,877
[Shane] Yes.

204
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,142
Toxicology report. She's clean.

205
00:10:21,185 --> 00:10:23,623
Right. Okay, great.
I'll add this to the notes.

206
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,886
Fantastic. Okay.

207
00:10:26,582 --> 00:10:29,193
Just a few things I wanted to
go over before we begin.

208
00:10:29,237 --> 00:10:31,326
Can you turn down
the music for me, please?

209
00:10:32,283 --> 00:10:34,590
[Alec] We will be starting
on the hour.

210
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,374
So, in about ten minutes.

211
00:10:36,418 --> 00:10:38,681
Sam, you'll have one minute
to complete each record.

212
00:10:38,725 --> 00:10:41,249
Uh, starting first
with burpee pull ups.

213
00:10:41,292 --> 00:10:43,425
Second will be wall ball squats.

214
00:10:43,468 --> 00:10:45,253
Third are handstand push ups.

215
00:10:45,296 --> 00:10:47,081
Those are fourth.
toe to bar is third.

216
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:50,127
Oh, you're right.
I'm sorry. [chuckles]

217
00:10:50,171 --> 00:10:53,000
Third is toe to bar.
Fourth is handstand push ups.

218
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:56,003
And the last is clean and jerk.

219
00:10:56,046 --> 00:10:58,919
So, uh, all must be completed
in a half hour

220
00:10:58,962 --> 00:11:00,877
for the comprehensive
world record.

221
00:11:00,921 --> 00:11:02,400
Six records in total.

222
00:11:03,314 --> 00:11:06,143
I will be monitoring the clock.

223
00:11:06,187 --> 00:11:07,667
-Do you--
-That one.

224
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,104
O-- okay, great.

225
00:11:10,147 --> 00:11:12,149
Uh, and counting each rep
to make sure that

226
00:11:12,193 --> 00:11:13,585
they're done to completion.

227
00:11:14,238 --> 00:11:17,241
I will also be reminding us
of the previous world records

228
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:19,287
and what needs to be
accomplished for the new record.

229
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:21,245
-Sound good?
-Sounds good.

230
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:22,377
-Yeah.
-[Alec] You ready?

231
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,814
Great.

232
00:11:24,858 --> 00:11:26,294
Uh, Shane,
will you show me the timer.

233
00:11:26,337 --> 00:11:27,599
-one more time, please?
-Yeah, for sure.

234
00:11:30,254 --> 00:11:32,517
Hey, Devin, we should snap
some pictures of Sam

235
00:11:32,561 --> 00:11:34,998
-before she gets going.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

236
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:36,173
Okay, hold on.

237
00:11:37,044 --> 00:11:38,741
-[indistinct] whiskey.
-Whiskey.

238
00:11:38,785 --> 00:11:40,264
[Devan] All right, go ahead--
go ahead and turn,

239
00:11:40,308 --> 00:11:41,788
like, 45 degree-- Nope, nope.

240
00:11:41,831 --> 00:11:43,615
Other way, other way,
other way. Stop.

241
00:11:43,659 --> 00:11:45,966
[speaking Spanish]

242
00:11:48,011 --> 00:11:49,883
[Devan] Oh, perfect.
Perfect. Got it.

243
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:51,754
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

244
00:11:51,798 --> 00:11:53,147
You're doing great.

245
00:11:55,671 --> 00:11:57,412
What?

246
00:11:57,455 --> 00:11:59,109
[Charlie] Maybe after this,
we can go get a burger?

247
00:11:59,631 --> 00:12:01,416
Fries, shake, usual. [chuckles]

248
00:12:04,027 --> 00:12:05,333
And we can talk.

249
00:12:08,118 --> 00:12:09,206
About what?

250
00:12:10,251 --> 00:12:11,774
Hey, Sam! Clock's ticking.

251
00:12:11,818 --> 00:12:13,254
What's your playlist?

252
00:12:13,297 --> 00:12:15,343
-Uh, jam sesh for that.
-All right.

253
00:12:15,386 --> 00:12:16,474
Jam sesh.

254
00:12:18,215 --> 00:12:22,785
[upbeat music plays on speakers]

255
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:25,179
All right.
It's got a vibe to it.

256
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,877
[chuckles] All right,
burpee pull ups are first.

257
00:12:27,921 --> 00:12:30,445
So, we wanna get
some nice gap pulls.

258
00:12:30,488 --> 00:12:31,794
Let's do some kips.

259
00:12:32,534 --> 00:12:35,189
We're going to spot our bars,
keep our nice wide stance.

260
00:12:35,232 --> 00:12:36,756
We're going to cut down
on our turnover time

261
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:37,844
this time, all right?

262
00:12:40,324 --> 00:12:42,109
[Blake] Hey, Sam,
this guy has something for ya.

263
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:46,809
-[man] Samantha Johnson?
-[Sam] Yeah.

264
00:12:46,853 --> 00:12:48,158
-You've been served.
-[Shane] Hey, what's going on?

265
00:12:48,202 --> 00:12:49,986
-Hey, hey! No.
-[Shane] Hey.

266
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,945
[man] I gotta give it to her.
I gotta give it to her.

267
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:54,077
Sam, you've been served.

268
00:12:54,121 --> 00:12:55,513
[Charlie] No,
this is not how this works.

269
00:12:55,557 --> 00:12:57,211
[man]
Hey, no. Settle down.

270
00:12:57,254 --> 00:12:58,952
How the heck did this guy
even get in here?

271
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:00,954
He-- he said he had
something urgent for Sam.

272
00:13:00,997 --> 00:13:03,783
[indistinct arguing]

273
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:04,958
[Shane] Served?

274
00:13:08,483 --> 00:13:10,528
[somber music plays]

275
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,844
[Charlie] Sam?

276
00:13:23,324 --> 00:13:24,847
-[Charlie] Sam.
-[Shane] Okay, Charlie. Okay.

277
00:13:24,891 --> 00:13:26,153
[Charlie]
Sam, I can explain this.

278
00:13:26,196 --> 00:13:27,676
-[Shane] Sam?
-[Charlie] Sam.

279
00:13:28,242 --> 00:13:29,634
[Shane] Charlie,
hold up, hold up, hold up.

280
00:13:29,678 --> 00:13:30,810
-Hold on. Sam.
-[Charlie] Sam.

281
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,855
[Charlie] [muffled]
Sam, I can explain this.

282
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:34,161
[Shane]
What was that?

283
00:13:34,204 --> 00:13:35,684
[Charlie] Shane,
this is none of your business.

284
00:13:35,727 --> 00:13:37,207
[Shane] It's taking place
in my gym. It's my business.

285
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:38,643
[Charlie]
Okay, man.

286
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,428
-Let me explain, please.
-[Shane] Hey. Hey, come on.

287
00:13:41,472 --> 00:13:42,996
[Charlie] Sam, I'm sorry,
That wasn't supposed to happen.

288
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,867
Can you open this?
I need to talk to you.

289
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:46,564
[Shane] I don't think
she wants to talk to you, dude.

290
00:13:46,608 --> 00:13:48,262
Give her space here. Come on.

291
00:13:48,305 --> 00:13:49,698
-[Charlie] Don't touch me.
-[Shane] Come on.

292
00:13:49,741 --> 00:13:51,221
-[Charlie] Sam!
-[Shane] Charlie.

293
00:13:51,265 --> 00:13:52,875
-[Charlie] I-- I--
-[Shane] Let's go.

294
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,703
-Come on, roll out.
-[Charlie] [indistinct]

295
00:13:54,746 --> 00:13:57,401
Is that why you came?
So you could watch my reaction?

296
00:13:57,445 --> 00:13:58,925
-[Charlie] No!
-[Shane] All right.

297
00:13:58,968 --> 00:14:01,101
[Charlie] No!
I said don't touch me.

298
00:14:01,144 --> 00:14:03,581
[Shane] You're overstaying
your welcome.

299
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:06,019
[Charlie] Sam, I'm so sorry,
I-- I promise I had no idea

300
00:14:06,062 --> 00:14:07,672
it was going to be--
be this fast.

301
00:14:07,716 --> 00:14:09,631
I-- I thought
I had time to stop it.

302
00:14:09,674 --> 00:14:11,415
You filed for divorce?

303
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:12,939
[Charlie] It wasn't supposed
to happen like this.

304
00:14:12,982 --> 00:14:14,592
[Shane]
You need to step back.

305
00:14:14,636 --> 00:14:16,290
[Charlie] This isn't
what I wanted, okay?

306
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,857
-[Shane] Come on.
-[Charlie] Don't touch me!

307
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,293
[Shane]
Charlie, let's go.

308
00:14:19,336 --> 00:14:20,207
[Charlie]
I said don't touch me!

309
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,035
That's my wife.

310
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:24,037
[Shane] You're standing
inside of my gym,

311
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,516
and I said you need to go!

312
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,651
[indistinct arguing]

313
00:14:30,826 --> 00:14:33,394
You asshole.
I can't believe you.

314
00:14:34,482 --> 00:14:36,049
Hey, hey. Sam.

315
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:38,878
Sam! Sam, stop!

316
00:14:41,402 --> 00:14:42,794
Look, I know it's a lot.

317
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,884
It's a lot. Okay?

318
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:46,842
Let's take a moment.
Come on, breathe.

319
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:50,541
Let's remember the big picture.

320
00:14:50,585 --> 00:14:51,934
Everything that
you put into this.

321
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:55,024
Let's not walk away
from what you're about to do.

322
00:14:57,418 --> 00:14:59,376
I can go tell Alec that
we need a delay or something

323
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,900
and that will be fine,

324
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:02,510
but I need you
in the right headspace.

325
00:15:02,553 --> 00:15:03,903
-He won't have time for that.
-Charlie.

326
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:08,995
[frustrated sigh]

327
00:15:13,434 --> 00:15:14,739
Look, there's a lot of rage.

328
00:15:14,783 --> 00:15:16,350
I get it.

329
00:15:16,393 --> 00:15:18,439
Trust me.
If anybody understands, I do.

330
00:15:20,397 --> 00:15:21,964
But there's a big
opportunity on the table

331
00:15:22,008 --> 00:15:23,400
in there for you,

332
00:15:24,532 --> 00:15:26,273
Right? World records.

333
00:15:26,316 --> 00:15:28,623
Maybe sponsorship, who knows?

334
00:15:29,145 --> 00:15:30,712
We wanted to see
what you could do.

335
00:15:30,755 --> 00:15:32,235
We wanted to push you
past your limits.

336
00:15:32,844 --> 00:15:34,324
You're the fittest
you ever been, right?

337
00:15:35,325 --> 00:15:37,632
We wanted to test that.
So, let's test it.

338
00:15:38,154 --> 00:15:40,069
Come on, you leaving right now
is not going to change

339
00:15:40,113 --> 00:15:41,592
whatever's happening
between you two.

340
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:44,595
Nobody controls
this moment but you.

341
00:15:48,295 --> 00:15:50,427
I want you to remember
what you're doing this for.

342
00:15:54,475 --> 00:15:56,216
Now, I'll get it
if you say you can't.

343
00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:02,657

511
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:19,903
Look at you.
Look at where you are now.

512
00:22:19,947 --> 00:22:21,731
You got us started
in this direction.

513
00:22:21,775 --> 00:22:23,646
We do this together.
You love this.

514
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,387
I know. And now it's your thing.

515
00:22:25,431 --> 00:22:27,781
-I'm doing this for both of us.
-[Charlie] Really?

516
00:22:27,824 --> 00:22:29,913
You fight more for a trophy
than you do for us.

517
00:22:29,957 --> 00:22:31,480
[Sam]
That is not fair.

518
00:22:31,524 --> 00:22:32,699
You know how hard
this last year has been.

519
00:22:32,742 --> 00:22:34,309
I have been fighting for us,

520
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,050
and you should be
right here with me.

521
00:22:36,093 --> 00:22:38,705
I know, and I tried
to tell you to slow down,

522
00:22:38,748 --> 00:22:41,055
but I can't go there
because it's like an attack.

523
00:22:43,492 --> 00:22:44,928
This is our dream.

524
00:22:45,233 --> 00:22:46,582
[Charlie]
This is your dream, Sam.

525
00:22:47,061 --> 00:22:48,628
People get divorced
all the time.

526
00:22:49,237 --> 00:22:50,281
So?

527
00:22:51,152 --> 00:22:52,588
It's not like we have kids

528
00:22:52,632 --> 00:22:54,111
or a mortgage
that keeps us together.

529
00:22:54,155 --> 00:22:55,852
[Sam]
Do you hear what you're saying?

530
00:22:55,896 --> 00:22:57,898
We don't need kids
or a house to keep us together.

531
00:22:57,941 --> 00:22:59,116
This should be about us.

532
00:23:01,989 --> 00:23:03,164
Am I not enough for you?

533
00:23:10,345 --> 00:23:12,434
Yeah. Maybe you should go.

534
00:23:21,356 --> 00:23:23,184
[Devan]
Hey, welcome back, Sam!

535
00:23:23,227 --> 00:23:24,968
[applause]

536
00:23:25,012 --> 00:23:26,753
[Shane] Let's go.
Let's get back into the zone.

537
00:23:26,796 --> 00:23:28,668
Look, this next one
is a little bit harder,

538
00:23:28,711 --> 00:23:29,886
but we knew this going in.

539
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:31,714
The first two were just warmups.

540
00:23:31,758 --> 00:23:34,021
-We're going for 42, right?
-[Alec] Yeah, or more.

541
00:23:34,064 --> 00:23:36,458
The last world record
was 41 in one minute.

542
00:23:36,502 --> 00:23:38,112
All right,
we got about 20 minutes.

543
00:23:38,155 --> 00:23:39,896
-You good with that?
-Yeah.

544
00:23:41,028 --> 00:23:43,465
Hey. You got this.

545
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:46,947
For one minute,
you're going to go all out

546
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:50,167
and you can do anything
for one minute, you hear me?

547
00:23:50,211 --> 00:23:52,343
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Hey.

548
00:23:53,736 --> 00:23:54,868
You good?

549
00:23:54,911 --> 00:23:56,957
[somber music plays]

550
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,262
Yeah. Okay.

551
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:00,177
All right.

552
00:24:00,874 --> 00:24:02,484
She's good. Let's go.

553
00:24:02,528 --> 00:24:04,094
[Devan] Come on, Sam.
Come on, come on.

554
00:24:04,138 --> 00:24:06,096
[Shane] World record
number three coming up!

555
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,490
-Halfway there.
-World record number three.

556
00:24:08,534 --> 00:24:09,970
Give it up.

557
00:24:10,013 --> 00:24:11,624
-[Blake] Three out of six.
-[Monica] You got this, Sam.

558
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:12,886
[Alec]
Hey, here we go.

559
00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:15,236
Previous record is 41 touches.

560
00:24:17,717 --> 00:24:19,283
[Devan] All right, Sam.
Come on. You got this.

561
00:24:19,327 --> 00:24:20,676
This is you. It's all you.

562
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,765
-[Sam sighs]
-[Alec] You ready, Sam?

563
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:24,071
[Sam clears her throat]

564
00:24:24,114 --> 00:24:25,681
[Alec]
Okay, timer in...

565
00:24:25,725 --> 00:24:28,771
ten, nine, eight,

566
00:24:28,815 --> 00:24:32,340
seven, six, five, four,

567
00:24:32,383 --> 00:24:36,344
[timer beeping]

568
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,781
-[Alec] One. Two.
-[Monica] There you go. Nice.

569
00:24:38,825 --> 00:24:39,913
[Blake] Yep.

570
00:24:41,436 --> 00:24:42,829
-[Blake] Yep. Keep it up.
-[Alec] Five.

571
00:24:42,872 --> 00:24:44,395
-[Blake] Keep it up!
-[Devan] That's it, that's it!

572
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:45,396
[Blake]
Looking good.

573
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:49,313
-[Monica] Looks great.
-[Blake] Yep.

574
00:24:49,357 --> 00:24:50,924
[Devan] Make it look easy, Sam.
Well done. Well done.

575
00:24:50,967 --> 00:24:52,273
-[Monica] 45 seconds.
-Keep that rhythm.

576
00:24:53,361 --> 00:24:54,841
-[Blake] Don't back off.
-[Alec] 15.

577
00:24:54,884 --> 00:24:56,146
Strong core,
strong core, strong core.

578
00:24:57,104 --> 00:24:58,279
[Devan] That's it,
breathe through it.

579
00:24:59,672 --> 00:25:01,325
-There you go.
-[Alec] 20.

580
00:25:01,369 --> 00:25:02,631
[Blake]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

581
00:25:02,675 --> 00:25:04,067
Yep. Strong core.

582
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:06,853
30 seconds. Halfway there.

583
00:25:06,896 --> 00:25:08,289
-[Alec] 25.
-[Blake] Halfway done.

584
00:25:08,332 --> 00:25:09,508
[Devan] Yes.

585
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:11,031
That's right, keep that rhythm.

586
00:25:11,074 --> 00:25:12,467
Keep that rhythm, Sam.
Looking good.

587
00:25:12,772 --> 00:25:14,513
-[Blake] Breathe.
-[Alec] 30.

588
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:16,297
-[Devan] Come on, dig deep.
-[Blake] Go, go, go!

589
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,907
[Shane] Get that foot up there.
Get that foot up there.

590
00:25:17,951 --> 00:25:19,561
-[Blake] Push.
-[Shane] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

591
00:25:19,605 --> 00:25:20,867
-Dig in, dig in, dig in now.
-[Alec] 35.

592
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:22,129
-15 seconds.
-[Blake] Push.

593
00:25:22,869 --> 00:25:24,305
-Keep going, keep going.
-[Devan] Come on, Sam!

594
00:25:24,348 --> 00:25:25,959
Press it!
Press it, press it, Sam.

595
00:25:26,002 --> 00:25:27,917
-[Monica] Ten seconds.
-[Alec] Come on! 40.

596
00:25:27,961 --> 00:25:29,789
-[Monica] Eight. Come on.
-[Shane] That's good.

597
00:25:29,832 --> 00:25:33,096
-[Shane] 42, 43! Let's go, Sam!
-[overlapping cheers]

598
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,838
-Three, two, one.
-[timer beeps]

599
00:25:35,882 --> 00:25:37,666
[Shane]
There we go!

600
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:41,452
[Alec] Amazing, Sam.
I counted 42 official touches.

601
00:25:41,496 --> 00:25:43,542
-Your third world record.
-[Blake] Nicely done.

602
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:45,805
-[Alec] Excellent work.
-[Monica] Oh, man.

603
00:25:46,632 --> 00:25:48,198
-[Devan] Yo!
-[Shane] [indistinct].

604
00:25:48,242 --> 00:25:49,460
Yeah, thanks, Blake.

605
00:25:49,504 --> 00:25:50,810
Take some water when
you need it, okay? Yeah.

606
00:25:52,072 --> 00:25:53,595
Oh, she's so strong.

607
00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:55,336
[all chuckle]

608
00:25:56,816 --> 00:25:59,340
-[Blake] Above and beyond.
-[Shane] Hey, what happened?

609
00:26:00,036 --> 00:26:01,560
-You good?
-Yeah.

610
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,997
-What do I do?
-[Shane] All right.

611
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,607
-Hey, Blake, go get me the kit.
-[Blake] Okay.

612
00:26:05,651 --> 00:26:07,087
And can you turn it down
a little bit?

613
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,479
-[Blake] Yeah.
-How you feel?

614
00:26:08,523 --> 00:26:10,046
-[Sam] Good. Yeah.
-Yeah, you look good up there.

615
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:12,222
-Thanks.
-[Shane chuckles]

616
00:26:12,266 --> 00:26:14,050
-You don't even break a sweat.
-[both chuckle]

617
00:26:14,094 --> 00:26:15,922
Hey, come on,
let's take care of that.

618
00:26:17,967 --> 00:26:19,403
I gotta say, Sam,

619
00:26:19,447 --> 00:26:20,579
when I saw
what was coming today,

620
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:21,580
I wasn't prepared for it.

621
00:26:21,623 --> 00:26:22,711
This is inspiring.

622
00:26:24,191 --> 00:26:26,106
Hey, look, we're going to just
take a few minutes here, okay?

623
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:27,237
We won't take long.

624
00:26:28,021 --> 00:26:29,283
All right.
Take whatever time you need.

625
00:26:29,326 --> 00:26:30,589
All right. Great.

626
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:31,894
Sam, when you're done,
just show me your hand.

627
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,331
Oh, those are the worst.

628
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:35,681
All right, thank you.

629
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,553
Gotta trim the skin.
You want to take off your ring?

630
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,337
Ah, I'll just trim around it.

631
00:26:40,381 --> 00:26:41,991
[Shane] Yeah,
but you got to put tape on.

632
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:44,646
Yeah.

633
00:26:48,432 --> 00:26:50,478
[scissors snipping]

634
00:26:50,521 --> 00:26:51,653
[Shane]
Did Charlie leave?

635
00:26:52,741 --> 00:26:54,874
-Yeah.
-Are you all okay?

636
00:26:54,917 --> 00:26:56,005
I mean...

637
00:26:56,832 --> 00:27:00,183
-Are you safe, Sam?
-Oh, yeah. Nothing like that.

638
00:27:00,227 --> 00:27:03,447
Charlie can't even
smash a spider.

639
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,366
No, we've--

640
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:11,412
we've been going
at it for a while, and...

641
00:27:12,413 --> 00:27:15,416
obviously,
the separation hasn't helped.

642
00:27:16,069 --> 00:27:19,115
Yeah, for what it's worth,
I don't know if you know,

643
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:21,074
but Marie and I were separated.

644
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:22,815
No way.

645
00:27:22,858 --> 00:27:24,207
You guys are the perfect couple.

646
00:27:24,251 --> 00:27:26,122
[Shane]
Fooled you.

647
00:27:26,166 --> 00:27:28,429
-I mean, it was a while ago.
-But you're together now.

648
00:27:29,778 --> 00:27:31,998
We worked it out. You know?

649
00:27:33,956 --> 00:27:36,176
Took a lot out of both of us.
It was a struggle.

650
00:27:36,219 --> 00:27:37,917
And I love her. There's that.

651
00:27:38,787 --> 00:27:40,136
Love fueled us.

652
00:27:40,789 --> 00:27:42,791
Just like you're going to need
some fuel after all this.

653
00:27:42,835 --> 00:27:44,924
It's going to take a lot more
than a protein shake

654
00:27:44,967 --> 00:27:46,186
to save my marriage.

655
00:27:46,229 --> 00:27:47,927
Come on, you know what I mean.

656
00:27:49,232 --> 00:27:50,669
Your dad.

657
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:51,844
What's something
that he would say to you

658
00:27:51,887 --> 00:27:52,975
in the midst of all this?

659
00:27:53,019 --> 00:27:54,281
Huh?

660
00:27:55,325 --> 00:27:57,110
He always knew
I wanted to be an athlete

661
00:27:57,153 --> 00:27:59,503
-or something growing up.
-[Shane] Mm-hmm?

662
00:27:59,547 --> 00:28:01,636
So he'd always say,
"Somebody's got to do it,

663
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,898
so it might as well be you."

664
00:28:03,856 --> 00:28:05,118
So matter of fact.

665
00:28:05,161 --> 00:28:06,293
And it will be you.

666
00:28:08,425 --> 00:28:10,297
So, let's keep that.
You use that for later.

667
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,472
[Sam scoffs]

668
00:28:13,735 --> 00:28:16,172
-For social?
-No, for the news.

669
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:19,001
-You didn't.
-What do you mean?

670
00:28:19,045 --> 00:28:20,829
A member of my gym
is a world class

671
00:28:20,873 --> 00:28:22,483
record-holding
sponsored athlete.

672
00:28:22,526 --> 00:28:24,180
You better believe
I'm calling the news.

673
00:28:24,224 --> 00:28:26,661
-You jerk.
-[Shane chuckles]

674
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,619
Hey, look, we only got
a few more minutes, okay?

675
00:28:28,663 --> 00:28:30,491
So let's do
some dynamic stretches.

676
00:28:30,534 --> 00:28:32,449
Yeah. Stay warm, stay loose.

677
00:28:32,493 --> 00:28:34,277
You're taking too much
of a break over here.

678
00:28:34,321 --> 00:28:35,757
-Don't tell me what to do.
-[Shane chuckles]

679
00:28:35,801 --> 00:28:37,367
I'll get your mats up for you.

680
00:28:41,632 --> 00:28:44,418
-Hey, is she okay?
-Yeah, she's good.

681
00:28:45,941 --> 00:28:48,117
So is the goal The Games?

682
00:28:48,161 --> 00:28:50,598
Well, that's where we
anticipate her to leave a mark.

683
00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:52,643
Right, world's fittest person
or something, right?

684
00:28:55,255 --> 00:28:57,257
-Yeah.
-She's never been?

685
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,172
She killed
at the opening last year.

686
00:28:59,215 --> 00:29:00,782
She moved
right through the semifinals.

687
00:29:00,826 --> 00:29:01,914
How did she do?

688
00:29:02,479 --> 00:29:04,612
Well, that's when
her dad got really sick.

689
00:29:04,655 --> 00:29:06,875
Well, he died
right before it started.

690
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:09,530
She went straight home
and never got on stage.

691
00:29:10,661 --> 00:29:13,664
[music plays faintly
in the background]

692
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:25,546
[paper rustling]

693
00:29:27,069 --> 00:29:31,204
[somber music plays]

694
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,825
All right, let's do it.

695
00:29:46,306 --> 00:29:47,394
Clock's ticking.

696
00:29:48,482 --> 00:29:50,092
Handstand push ups are next.

697
00:29:50,136 --> 00:29:51,790
It's one
of your strongest sections.

698
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:53,356
It's gonna be
a walk in the park for you.

699
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,141
All right,
previous world record is 12.

700
00:29:55,184 --> 00:29:57,621
We're looking for 13
complete handstand push ups.

701
00:29:57,665 --> 00:29:59,928
That means your head must come
all the way down to the mat,

702
00:29:59,972 --> 00:30:02,409
arm's fully extended,
or it won't count.

703
00:30:02,452 --> 00:30:04,585
-Okay, are you ready?
-[Sam] Yeah.

704
00:30:04,628 --> 00:30:06,456
[Alec]
All right, timer in ten,

705
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,242
nine, eight, seven,

706
00:30:09,285 --> 00:30:12,201
six, five, four.

707
00:30:12,245 --> 00:30:15,857
[timer beeping]

708
00:30:15,901 --> 00:30:17,641
-[Devan] Go, Sam.
-Here we go. Here we go.

709
00:30:17,685 --> 00:30:20,166
-One. Two.
-[Devan] That's it. That's it.

710
00:30:20,209 --> 00:30:21,689
[Shane]
Let's go. It's okay.

711
00:30:21,732 --> 00:30:23,430
-[Monica] Right back up.
-You got this.

712
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,608
-Three.
-Feel your balance.

713
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,481
[Sam sighs] Reset. Reset.
I'm going again.

714
00:30:31,525 --> 00:30:33,005
My balance is off.

715
00:30:33,788 --> 00:30:35,268
-[Shane] It's okay.
-[Sam] Way off.

716
00:30:35,311 --> 00:30:36,878
Hey, look, this is easy for you,

717
00:30:36,922 --> 00:30:39,054
-[Sam groans]
-Remember? Hey, it's okay.

718
00:30:39,098 --> 00:30:40,795
You got this. All right?

719
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,449
30 minutes, five records.

720
00:30:42,492 --> 00:30:43,842
Doesn't matter
how many times I try, yeah?

721
00:30:43,885 --> 00:30:45,060
[Alec]
Right. Let's go again.

722
00:30:45,104 --> 00:30:46,714
All right, but you don't have

723
00:30:46,757 --> 00:30:48,150
-as much time left after this--
-I know. I know.

724
00:30:48,194 --> 00:30:49,848
-I'm doing the math.
-Okay.

725
00:30:49,891 --> 00:30:51,066
-This is fine, right?
-[Alec] Absolutely.

726
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,894
As long as you're okay with it.

727
00:30:52,938 --> 00:30:54,635
-[Sam] Yeah. Let's go.
-Okay. So, Sam, you ready?

728
00:30:54,678 --> 00:30:57,072
-Yeah. It's good.
-[Alec] Okay, great. Timer in...

729
00:30:57,116 --> 00:31:00,728
ten, nine, eight,

730
00:31:00,771 --> 00:31:04,775
seven, six, five, four.

731
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:08,649
[timer beeping]

732
00:31:10,651 --> 00:31:13,088
-One. Two.
-You go, Sam.

733
00:31:13,132 --> 00:31:14,611
-Sam.
-Three.

734
00:31:14,655 --> 00:31:15,874
Good balance.

735
00:31:16,962 --> 00:31:18,441
-[Devan] Good. Good!
-Nice.

736
00:31:18,485 --> 00:31:20,095
-That's good.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good.

737
00:31:20,139 --> 00:31:22,750
Take time to reset,
you're at 45 seconds.

738
00:31:22,793 --> 00:31:24,056
Killing it, Sam.

739
00:31:24,099 --> 00:31:25,361
Come on, Sam. Focus. That's it.

740
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,146
[Blake chuckles]

741
00:31:27,189 --> 00:31:28,669
-Make it look easy.
-Ten.

742
00:31:28,712 --> 00:31:30,889
-Nice.
-Not even against the wall.

743
00:31:30,932 --> 00:31:32,586
-Not even halfway.
-[Shane] Good. Good.

744
00:31:32,629 --> 00:31:35,371
-Yes!
-A little faster if you can.

745
00:31:35,415 --> 00:31:37,243
-13, 14.
-[Shane] That's good.

746
00:31:37,286 --> 00:31:38,853
-[Shane] Keep that back.
-[Monica] 30 seconds.

747
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,942
-[Alec] 15.
-[Devan] Come on, come on!

748
00:31:40,986 --> 00:31:42,639
-Yes! Come on, keep going.
-[Shane] Good, Sam.

749
00:31:42,683 --> 00:31:44,598
-17
-Strong in your core.

750
00:31:44,641 --> 00:31:46,556
-Strong in your core.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

751
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,210
-[Alec] It's okay. It's okay.
-[Devan] Breathe, come on.

752
00:31:48,254 --> 00:31:49,646
-[Monica] 20 seconds.
-[Shane] Good. Good.

753
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:51,213
-[Alec] 18.
-Good. Keep going.

754
00:31:51,257 --> 00:31:53,737
19. 20!

755
00:31:53,781 --> 00:31:55,783
[Shane] You got it, Sam!
You got it!

756
00:31:55,826 --> 00:31:57,132
[Alec] 21!

757
00:31:57,176 --> 00:31:58,655
[Shane chuckles]
This is amazing!

758
00:31:58,699 --> 00:32:00,048
-Last push, last push.
-[Alec] 22.

759
00:32:01,136 --> 00:32:02,485
Post stretch. Come on, come on.

760
00:32:02,529 --> 00:32:03,617
Three.

761
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:07,316
-24.
-Three, two, one.

762
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,405
-24.
-[all cheering] Yes!

763
00:32:09,449 --> 00:32:11,320
-[Alec] Yes!
-[Monica] Oh, my gosh!

764
00:32:11,364 --> 00:32:12,626
[Shane]
How many was that, Alec?

765
00:32:12,669 --> 00:32:14,019
-[Alec] 24.
-[Shane] 24.

766
00:32:14,062 --> 00:32:16,064
[Monica]
Doubled the world record.

767
00:32:16,108 --> 00:32:17,979
All right.

768
00:32:18,023 --> 00:32:20,068
All right, all right, all right.

769
00:32:21,896 --> 00:32:23,506
Sam.

770
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,031
Sam, you all right?

771
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,947
Sam? Hey.

772
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:33,429
[retching, coughing]

773
00:32:34,865 --> 00:32:38,565
[Sam coughing, inhaling deeply]

774
00:32:41,481 --> 00:32:43,657
[Shane]
Breathe. Just breathe.

775
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,008
[Sam breathing heavily]

776
00:32:50,011 --> 00:32:51,665
Did you fuel up okay yesterday?

777
00:32:52,579 --> 00:32:54,320
Maybe you overdid
a little with the water.

778
00:32:56,887 --> 00:32:58,541
I don't know. Probably.

779
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:08,987
[sighs deeply]

780
00:33:13,034 --> 00:33:14,470
How much time?

781
00:33:14,514 --> 00:33:16,081
Hm, about seven
or eight more minutes.

782
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,605
[Sam exhales sharply]

783
00:33:20,476 --> 00:33:22,130
So do we add weight to the bar?

784
00:33:22,174 --> 00:33:25,699
Less reps or do we take
some off to do fewer?

785
00:33:25,742 --> 00:33:28,658
We're at 185 already.
It's already pretty heavy.

786
00:33:28,702 --> 00:33:30,095
I don't think
we should go heavier.

787
00:33:31,661 --> 00:33:33,707
Cycling knees
isn't your strongest.

788
00:33:34,186 --> 00:33:35,752
Why is this last again?

789
00:33:36,536 --> 00:33:37,928
Because you asked for it.

790
00:33:37,972 --> 00:33:39,626
[chuckling]

791
00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:41,236
We're pushing
a lot of shoulders.

792
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,022
That was stupid.
Why didn't you stop me?

793
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:45,197
Well, I tried.

794
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,676
Didn't know
you were going to go all out

795
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,895
on the handstands.

796
00:33:50,332 --> 00:33:52,987
We're going to need you
at 110% for this next one.

797
00:33:54,728 --> 00:33:56,730
You currently
hold four world records.

798
00:33:57,818 --> 00:33:59,994
-One more to go.
-[Sam sighs]

799
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,996
Just a minute.
I just need a minute.

800
00:34:05,608 --> 00:34:08,220
All right, you got your minute.

801
00:34:13,703 --> 00:34:16,054
[exhales sharply]

802
00:34:36,726 --> 00:34:38,772
[exhales sharply]

803
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:45,518
[exhales sharply]

804
00:34:50,218 --> 00:34:52,090
[exhales sharply]

805
00:34:57,269 --> 00:34:59,401
[exhales sharply]

806
00:35:04,972 --> 00:35:06,930
[exhales sharply]

807
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,112
[exhales sharply]

808
00:35:24,861 --> 00:35:26,428
[Shane]
You ready for this, Sam?

809
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,169
I know you are.

810
00:35:29,214 --> 00:35:32,478
Bar's been chalked
and set at 185.

811
00:35:33,696 --> 00:35:35,655
We're gonna go ten times.

812
00:35:35,698 --> 00:35:39,485
[Alec] Previous world record
is set at lifting 785 pounds.

813
00:35:40,312 --> 00:35:43,271
10 reps at this point
will be 850 pounds.

814
00:35:44,054 --> 00:35:45,317
You ready, Sam?

815
00:35:46,796 --> 00:35:48,363
[exhales sharply]

816
00:35:49,756 --> 00:35:51,018
-Yeah.
-[Alec] Okay.

817
00:35:51,061 --> 00:35:55,196
Timer in ten, nine, eight,

818
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:59,548
seven, six, five, four.

819
00:35:59,592 --> 00:36:03,204
[timer beeping]

820
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,121
-[Alec] One.
-[athletes] Nice!

821
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,644
Great lock off, Sam.

822
00:36:09,906 --> 00:36:12,213
-[Blake] Deep breath.
-[Monica] You got this.

823
00:36:16,043 --> 00:36:17,697
[Alec]
That's two!

824
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,568
-[Shane] [indistinct]
-[Monica] 45 seconds.

825
00:36:19,612 --> 00:36:21,004
[Alec]
Form is perfect, Sam.

826
00:36:21,614 --> 00:36:23,877
[Devan] Come on, Sam. Dig deep.
You got this. Come on.

827
00:36:28,098 --> 00:36:29,187
[Blake] Nice.

828
00:36:29,752 --> 00:36:31,363
[Devan]
Come on, come on, come on!

829
00:36:31,406 --> 00:36:33,626
-[Blake] Good.
-Great lock off, Sam, good job.

830
00:36:33,669 --> 00:36:35,280
[Monica] Nice!

831
00:36:35,323 --> 00:36:37,151
[Blake] 30 seconds.
Less than 30 seconds.

832
00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:41,373
Make it lighter.
We got to start over.

833
00:36:41,416 --> 00:36:43,679
All right,
we're going to start over.

834
00:36:43,723 --> 00:36:45,899
-Let's reset the clock.
-Set it to 150.

835
00:36:45,942 --> 00:36:47,640
-You want it at 150?
-[Sam] Yes.

836
00:36:47,683 --> 00:36:49,468
-That'll have to be...
-She'll have to do

837
00:36:49,511 --> 00:36:50,947
12 reps at that weight.

838
00:36:50,991 --> 00:36:52,819
-12 reps are good with that?
-I know.

839
00:36:52,862 --> 00:36:54,299
-[Shane] 12 reps are good?
-Yeah. Let's go.

840
00:36:55,822 --> 00:36:57,824
Ah, hey, Blake, can you go
out there and just tell them

841
00:36:57,867 --> 00:36:59,782
to hold a beat,
give us a minute.

842
00:36:59,826 --> 00:37:01,697
They can wait inside, but
they got to be in the corner.

843
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:05,223
Okay, you guys only have about
two minutes left to plan, okay?

844
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:07,094
All right, this is going
to feel a lot lighter,

845
00:37:07,137 --> 00:37:08,791
so you're going to want
to power through it,

846

-[Shane] Yes, Sam, you did.

You made four records
in a half hour.

917

That's probably a record
in and of itself.

five in 30 minutes.

in the history books, right?

it's the sponsors again.

Hey, look, they don't even know
that we started so late.

They probably think we've been
done for a while, now.

926
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:13,498
What I'm saying is, is that
you still have sponsorship

in your cards.

and you cleared the atmosphere.

only lead athletes can do.

all over the world

You are a gifted athlete.

You should be competing
in the games and they know that.
