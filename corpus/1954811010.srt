00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:50,315
       � To you Claire �

2
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:53,085
Hey Claire, make a wish.

3
00:00:53,087 --> 00:00:54,386
             Make it a good one.

4
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:55,754
Don't be afraid to be selfish.

5
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:02,261
Who wants cake?
                           I do.

6
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:06,098
All righty,
starting South Beach tomorrow.

7
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,233
Yeah, that's how I feel.

8
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:12,271
             So, you're 29, huh?
    Oh, God, I know, I'm 29.

9
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:14,673
   Astrologically,
   29 is the most important year

10
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:17,709
              in a woman's life.
Yeah, well, astrologically...

11
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:20,579
Want some cake?
It's Claire's birthday.

12
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,848
           It doesn't need to be
           about food, Mom.

13
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,317
Woo, tickle Daisy.

14
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:27,820
           Happy B-day, C.B.
      Thank you, Steve.

15
00:01:27,822 --> 00:01:29,488
          How are you?
Great.

16
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,856
              Hi.

17
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:32,524
                 Hi, little one.

18
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:34,426
             You look very chic.
    Thank you.

19
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,728
I'm in the middle
of my upper east side
Manhattan phase.

20
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:37,830
           Oh, right.

21
00:01:37,832 --> 00:01:42,835
Ooh, Sharon.
                         Tim.

22
00:01:42,837 --> 00:01:44,736
Hey, Daisy.
                    Hi, Tim.

23
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:47,206
Up top, buddy.
                         Really?

24
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:49,341
Yeah.

25
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:50,642
               And a bump. Nice.

26
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:52,644
                      Well done.

27
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:54,513
             I see you haven't
             tried the cake yet.

28
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:56,615
            Not yet.

29
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,717
  It's just that I brought it.

30
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,187
        Sharon, I will.

31
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,356
Can you not yell at me
     in front of Daisy?

32
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:06,225
  She picks up on the tension.

33
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:08,527
                Did I yell?

34
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,867
- Cheers.
-     Cheers. Happy birthday.

35
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:18,704
We're not supposed to love
one person, you know?

36
00:02:18,706 --> 00:02:21,773
                   Yes. Totally.
   Me.

37
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:24,276
Me, I'm going to love
one person for five years,

38
00:02:24,278 --> 00:02:27,880
and then another,
and then another, and...
                         Cool.

39
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:30,249
So, what'd you wish for?

40
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:32,417
      Wishes are private.

41
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:33,852
          Hey, you didn't
          get your birthday hug.

42
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:37,523
Oh, I'm not really a hugger.

43
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:40,826
Claire always
leaves the family.
      Yeah.

44
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,227
                Christ.

45
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,297
          29.

46
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:47,232
                     59. Ugh.

47
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:49,201
               ��

48
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:51,503
Joanie!
                    Hey, El.

49
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:54,506
Better late than never.
                       Oh, hi.

50
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:58,677
         Thank God.
         Come on, dance with me.
           Sure.

51
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:19,631
                     Hey, Ellen.

52
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:20,866
Hey, sweetie.

53
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,834
     Thanks for your help.

54
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:25,904
Of course.
There isn't anything
I wouldn't do for your mother.

55
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:28,373
   She's the sister I never had.

56
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,975
   Hey, lady.

57
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:33,845
Hey, hi.
             What did I say now?

58
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:35,380
Good to see you.
   Good to see you.

59
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,682
    This is the son I never had.

60
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:39,451
      Thank you.

61
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:40,686
          Mom?

62
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:42,221
How's the photography going?

63
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:45,791
Well, it took a while,
but I rebuilt my empire.

64
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:48,560
Plus, I'm taking classes
to become a medium.

65
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:51,330
     Wow.
Got to have
something to fall back on.

66
00:03:51,332 --> 00:03:53,832
So you're going to be able
to tell when things
are going to happen?

67
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:56,902
No, that's a psychic.
A clairvoyant.

68
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:59,905
People who've crossed over
use as me as like a...

69
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:02,341
tuning fork.
Telephone.

70
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:04,443
        He talks to dead people.
      Wow.

71
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:05,978
  So, what have they taught you?

72
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:10,616
Just, try to eat more fiber,
smoke more marijuana.

73
00:04:10,618 --> 00:04:12,818
         Oh, we don't do that.
Me neither.

74
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,500
     That's too long.
     People look at me too long.

75
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:30,369
It looks nice on you.
People like it.

76
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:32,437
I heard you get
a lot of compliments on it.

77
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,772
    Yeah, I know,
    but it's a distraction.

78
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,875
            I'm going to shower.
    Okay.

79
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:40,379
      I'm going to order dinner.

80
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,482
<i> Lewis?</i>

81
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:45,984
You've got to see this blanket
that Sharon got me.

82
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:48,387
    It's so cute.
 <i> I have to wash my legs before.</i>

83
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:50,489
       <i> I can't just count</i>
       <i> on the soap coming down.</i>

84
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:53,358
                         Oh, no.

85
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,860
Oh, Kendra.

86
00:04:54,862 --> 00:04:56,628
        <i> Oh, the</i> New York Times.

87
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,897
       <i> I want to thank you guys</i>
       <i> for a great write up.</i>

88
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:01,566
           <i> You guys. Thank you.</i>

89
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,379
                 <i> Am I a genius?</i>

90
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:17,516
           <i> No more than you are</i>
           <i> for liking the book.</i>

91
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:22,854
      <i> I want to thank Claire</i>
      <i> out there</i>

92
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:24,589
      <i> for being there for me.</i>

93
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,992
         <i> Every step of the way,</i>
         <i> she's been there.</i>

94
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:39,771
I am loving these new towels.

95
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,846
           Shit.

96
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,548
It looks bad.

97
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,882
It is bad.

98
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:54,786
I don't even know how to...

99
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:57,723
       All right.

100
00:05:57,725 --> 00:06:00,692
I don't think we should
live together anymore.

101
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,929
I don't think
we should stay together.

102
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,707
      I should have known
      when you got me a toaster.

103
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,677
I was trying to be nice.
           It's not nice, Lewis.

104
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:22,013
It was a stupid gift.

105
00:06:24,485 --> 00:06:25,884
                     God.

106
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:30,889
I don't know how to do this.

107
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,557
There hasn't been a window.

108
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,025
Your mom's been
freaking out about the party,

109
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:35,794
Sharon's been
freaking out about the cake,

110
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:38,997
Kendra's been... being Kendra,
which makes you freak out.

111
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:43,568
   I have not been freaking out.

112
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,737
        Is that it?

113
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,173
     It's a lot of "it's."

114
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:49,875
       What?

115
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,412
            I'm sorry.

116
00:06:57,049 --> 00:07:01,453
 Hey,
 it's just seven years, right?

117
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:04,856
     It's not Afghanistan.

118
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:06,591
I'm going to miss
your sense of humor.

119
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,494
I'm sor... sorry.

120
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:13,665
   I'm stupid.

121
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:16,835
      You already know
      what you're going to miss.

122
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,710
<i> I know, honey.</i>
  <i> That's terrible.</i>

123
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:27,646
         <i> I'm so sorry.</i>

124
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:31,616
            Yes.

125
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:34,519
           I agree.

126
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:35,987
      All right, sweetie.

127
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:37,622
I hope you get some rest.

128
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,624
        We love you.
                    We love you.

129
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:40,759
            Yeah.

130
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:42,961
      Okay. All righty.

131
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,464
             Bye.

132
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:47,666
              God.

133
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:49,734
       On her birthday.

134
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,870
          Other fish in the sea.

135
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:53,939
Bob, he's not a fish.

136
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:57,142
He's the man
she loved for seven years.

137
00:07:57,144 --> 00:08:01,613
                     He's a boy.

138
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:07,686
And did you see something
between Sharon and Steve?

139
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,654
                      Yeah.

140
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:12,090
                      Sharon.
          Yeah.

141
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:20,832
   Are we having sex tonight?

142
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,937
   Yeah. Yeah.

143
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:29,741
You want to have sex tonight?

144
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:39,017
Boy, I wish
Kendra could meet someone nice.

145
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,786
              She's just a baby.

146
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,701
              You're so cute.

147
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,103
<i> I don't know.</i>

148
00:08:58,105 --> 00:09:01,006
Sometimes I miss
the sound of a hairdryer.

149
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:07,245
         You can blow dry Zippy.

150
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:09,080
I think I will.

151
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:22,060
<i> It's your mother!</i>

152
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,596
         I can't talk.

153
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:27,198
       <i> She wants to know</i>
       <i> if you've called Claire.</i>

154
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,235
              No!

155
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:33,905
               She wants to know
               if you've tried.

156
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,207
            Is that my shirt?

157
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:39,110
                          No.

158
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,015
Mom,
Claire doesn't want to talk.

159
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:46,918
She says that
but she doesn't really mean it.

160
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,186
           <i> Well, then,</i>
           <i> let Claire say that.</i>

161
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:51,222
  <i> I have an audition here, Mom.</i>

162
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:52,958
            <i> Kendra. Uh, Kendra?</i>

163
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,693
           What, Mom?

164
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:57,128
             Please call Claire.

165
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,297
    Claire, Claire, Claire.

166
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:08,139
Come back later.

167
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:09,975
<i> Maintenance.</i>

168
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:12,143
Oh, my God.

169
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,215
     What?

170
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:18,950
                  Oh, I'm sorry,
                  Alex Cooper,

171
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:22,253
      I thought
      this was my sister's room.

172
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:23,855
What are you doing here?

173
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:30,629
                     Oh, Claire.

174
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:37,869
          Mom was worried.
          She, um, followed you.

175
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:41,306
           Why didn't
           you come to my house?

176
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:44,909
            It hurt my feelings.
    Sharon, please!

177
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:48,947
Really, can I just be
the hurt one right now, please?

178
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:50,415
               Of course.

179
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:53,785
                      I'm sorry.

180
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,858
Can you believe this happened?

181
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,660
           It's disgusting.

182
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:03,928
Like, he doesn't love me.
Fine.

183
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,831
But, I mean,
I don't love him either.

184
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,967
It's like,
you'd think he's so great

185
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:13,271
because he's so successful
and good looking.

186
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:16,041
   I'm a catch, too.

187
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:18,943
            Yes, you are.

188
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:22,447
         Really?
              Yes, you are.

189
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,885
    I see you're eating organic.

190
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:28,319
      Don't judge me.

191
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:30,455
       Is this
       all you brought with you?

192
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:32,323
     I didn't move in.
                           Okay.

193
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:36,895
          You know,
          I looked this place up

194
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:39,798
          on the bedbug registry
          and it is rated

195
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,802
         I'm not
         going to tell you what.

196
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:44,836
       Oh, God.

197
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,340
                 Absolutely not.
       Yes.

198
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:50,775
                No.

199
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:54,713
    But I need them.
                             No.

200
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:02,320
And do I need to pay for this
or have you already prepaid?

201
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:04,489
        Sharon, I'll pay for it.
                  Okay.

202
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,392
               Jesus!

203
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,961
  Will someone
  please move the recycle bin?

204
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,998
     You think
     they actually recycle?

205
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,934
How's the remodel going?

206
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:17,502
         I don't know.

207
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:19,738
     I've lost my instinct.

208
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,107
No, Sharon. It's great.

209
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:26,144
You've always been
who you were.

210
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,814
          Hey, Pavel.

211
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,986
Sharon, I really don't
want to see anybody today.

212
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:36,488
         And you won't.

213
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,356
Claire?

214
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:40,525
God, Sharon.
    I'm sorry, she wore me down.

215
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:42,527
  Oh, Claire.

216
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:46,197
   Hey Mom.
   I'm totally fine, really.
      Good.

217
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,799
She looks really sad.

218
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:50,001
             She's very worried.
             We all are worried.

219
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:51,336
    Uh, honey?

220
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:53,371
You look pretty.

221
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:55,507
           Thank you.

222
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:57,242
     Seriously,
     can you put your foot

223
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:59,310
    on the gas and let's go,
    please?

224
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:01,312
Open up, honey.
What's wrong with this thing?

225
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:02,814
Am I doing
something wrong here?

226
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:04,549
          It's baby locked, Mom.
               Oh, okay.

227
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:07,952
Kendra,
come say hi to your sister.

228
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,487
Come on.

229
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:11,089
                  Is that Mommy?

230
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:13,925
                 Is that Mommy?
    Look at that.

231
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:16,327
        How's my monkey?
        How's my monkey?

232
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,997
What time did she eat?
      She didn't cry for food.

233
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:21,866
     Does she have to cry?
     For food?

234
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:23,368
      Are you saying
      I'm starving our daughter?

235
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,270
  I'm not starving our daughter.
I'm saying...

236
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:27,972
Honey,
we got some good snacks inside.

237
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,808
Come on in.
Want something good to drink?

238
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,242
I just need like one second.

239
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:34,145
Okay, honey. Okay.

240
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,989
                           What?

241
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,292
  Get out of the car, Claire.

242
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:49,360
   I see Kendra's not committing
   to the sympathy march.

243
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:51,830
Don't fight.
Mom's going through enough.

244
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,431
     We're not fighting,
     Sharon, we're just...

245
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:56,467
       just not talking,
       that's all.

246
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:59,470
Listen, I wasn't
supposed to tell you this,

247
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:03,975
but Mom and Dad
have to sell their house.

248
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:05,310
             What?

249
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:07,478
Dad made
some horrible investments,

250
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,347
electric dog collars
or something like that.

251
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,915
              Oh, my God.

252
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,617
I know.

253
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:14,986
         What is that?

254
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:17,622
Oh, we're moving the pool.

255
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,931
<i> Front door closed.</i>

256
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:29,300
        That's driving me crazy.

257
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:32,036
         I've become so horribly
         sound sensitive lately.

258
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,472
 Even a leaf blower
 makes me want to shoot somebody

259
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:35,540
           or myself.

260
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,642
        When did I get this way?

261
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:40,311
Oh, Gosh, Sharon, I don't know.

262
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:41,880
                Come here, baby.

263
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:44,115
           Oh, God. Here she is.
           The breakup girl.

264
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:48,386
          Hey.<i> Mi casa, su casa.</i>

265
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,488
Hey, you seem okay.

266
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,656
             Really, do I?

267
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:53,291
       'Cause I don't feel okay.

268
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:56,261
Then you will be.
  Girls, love each other.

269
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:58,162
                    Mom, please.

270
00:14:58,164 --> 00:14:59,998
Love these pistachios.

271
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,033
Yeah, I got to go,
I have rehearsal.

272
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:03,635
       Oh.

273
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:05,904
            All right. I'm fine.

274
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:08,139
 That's all I was trying to say.

275
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:09,540
   And, if it's any consolation,

276
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,175
        I always
        thought his beard was...

277
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:13,678
               just a little too
               well thought out.

278
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,015
         Thanks.

279
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:28,660
     Robertson was a mess today.

280
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:30,428
  He was downtown the other day,

281
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:34,198
     and there's a secret onramp
     northbound of the 101

282
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,068
just south of Alameda,
which is great.

283
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,003
          Beautiful blueberries.

284
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:41,072
      Low on the glycemic index,

285
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:43,408
              full of vitamin C,
              antioxidants.

286
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,643
Costco
had a huge giant clamshell

287
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:48,613
of these things for 5.99.
Unbelievable.

288
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:49,948
        You get, like,
        three gallons of pickles

289
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,215
            for, like, 37 cents.

290
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:53,151
 They have a travel agency, too.

291
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:56,621
        They're anti-depressant.

292
00:15:56,623 --> 00:16:00,158
       Thanks. I'm okay.
           All right.

293
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:08,566
God, look at this house.

294
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,335
          This stuff.

295
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:13,638
It's just stuff, honey.

296
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,341
Sharon gets all the stuff.

297
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:19,277
             There's stuff
             Sharon doesn't get.

298
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:30,455
   Sort of took you by surprise,
   huh?

299
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:33,157
                   Yeah, me too.

300
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:37,228
       He didn't love me.

301
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,999
     He's nuts.
     Who wouldn't love you, huh?

302
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:43,201
   What's he going to do now,
   baby?

303
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:44,335
                   Dad.
                          Bob.

304
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,436
               It just happened.

305
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:47,271
          Can I speak?

306
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:49,007
Let her just breathe
for a minute.
             Don't ask her that.

307
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,175
  Christ,
  it's like I have four wives.

308
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,011
  Three wives, one's missing.

309
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:56,314
     I just was explaining
     that what's his name,

310
00:16:56,316 --> 00:17:00,118
   Lewis, is gone,
   and she's going to have to be
   more independent.

311
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,320
Okay. All right.
That's enough.

312
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:06,290
Can we just please not talk
about Lewis for two seconds?

313
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,693
I mean,
there are more important things
going on in the world.

314
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:11,529
           There are, there are.
There's a crisis
in Yemen right now.

315
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:12,597
Did you hear about that?

316
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,700
And the E. coli,
you know, in...

317
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:18,236
                 Germany.
          Again with those guys.

318
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:20,071
   You just got to make the most
   of every minute.

319
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:22,173
 Take advantage of every second.

320
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,475
I don't want
to even hear his name, okay?

321
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:27,145
Did you hear that, Bob?
           Got it.

322
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:33,084
Oh, Esperanza, hi.

           Hey, Uri.

334
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:21,365
      I was in the neighborhood.

335
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:22,433
            You look amazing.

336
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:41,152
       I like your hair.

337
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:42,854
       I don't know.
       It came out a little red.

338
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:44,789
    Nah, it's fiery.

339
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,861

340
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:51,829
                      He's okay.

341
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:55,466
Your roommate still evil?

342
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,668
              She stole my robe.

343
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,570
The one with the dragon on it?

344
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:03,174
          She swears she didn't.

345
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:06,544
                    It's okay...

346

       Hey, hey, come on.

347
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:10,214

     I scared you.

350
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:17,922
I'm serious about love,

        Mommy's racing.

362
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:01,699
    You know, when I was running
    a company 70 hours a week,

363
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:05,469
  I was actually
  more calm than I am right now.

364
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:07,305
               Mommy was calmer.

365
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:09,941
So, okay, Mom,

366
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:13,744
     sometimes I'm okay,
     and sometimes I'm not,

367
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:15,947
      but I always
      have this awareness

368
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:20,818
 that my life is 99% better
 than most people in the world.

369
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,354
     99%.

370
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:25,890
              So, yes, I'm fine.

371
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:29,227
 I'm more than fine,
 but, you know, before all this,

372
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:31,963
         I had a life of my own.

373
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:34,599
      So, yeah, some days
      I just want to lay in bed,

00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:36,767
            <i> and other days</i>

you know how I was telling you

I was starting to feel
a little purposeless

386
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:16,340
and people had asked me,
"What do you do?"

387
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:20,278
and I'd freeze?

388
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,480
      Mom,
      you take care of everyone.

389
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:26,484
Well, now,
I'm going to get paid for it.

              Oh.

428
00:23:27,774 --> 00:23:29,940

        your own thing, too.

429
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:31,809

sitting around doing his--

430
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:33,944
          I was editing his blog
          for five years.

Feel good about that.

                            Yes.

434
00:23:39,986 --> 00:23:41,685

435
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:42,720

436
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:44,155
Yes, you can.

437
00:23:44,157 --> 00:23:47,925
I'm going

his stupid boring words.

441
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:56,500

          Yeah.

443

445
00:24:03,643 --> 00:24:05,609

and I lost my imagination.

     how fantastic you are.

451
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:22,827

00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:34,004
     She just got up and danced.

456
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:37,475
Mom! Please,
can we stop talking
about old famous people?

457
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:39,577
   Well,
   maybe I'll just stop talking.

458
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:40,845
             Okay.

459
00:24:40,847 --> 00:24:43,614
     After I tell you one thing.

460
00:24:43,616 --> 00:24:45,616
                   He called.

461
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:47,852
Who called?

462
00:24:47,854 --> 00:24:50,688
     Lewis. He called the house.

463
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,022
   Wait, what?

464
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:55,125
        When?
            Oh, I don't remember
            the exact day.

465
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:57,061
Wait, why is he
calling my family?

466
00:24:57,063 --> 00:24:59,530
             Honey, don't worry.
             It's not about you.

467
00:24:59,532 --> 00:25:01,532
        He just needed
        to speak to your father.

468
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:04,635
Okay, so, wait,
he called, and then what?

469
00:25:04,637 --> 00:25:06,570
                He dropped by.

470
00:25:06,572 --> 00:25:08,739
       What?

471
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:11,742
You guys just stood around
and chatted?

472
00:25:11,744 --> 00:25:14,278
About what? About how
he dumped me like cow shit?

473
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,813
                     Claire.
God, you're just...

474
00:25:15,815 --> 00:25:17,581
You're so busy chatting,
you don't even--

475
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:19,049
            Wait a minute.
              Mom,

476
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:22,152
you told the butcher
when I got my first period.

477
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:24,121
      That was, like,
      a hundred years ago.

478
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:26,857
 You told the tennis instructor
 how much I weighed.

479
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,259
      Roger was a family friend.

480
00:25:28,261 --> 00:25:29,627
Ellen knows everything.

481
00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:32,897
        Ellen is my best friend.

482
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:34,798
Did you tell Sharon?

483
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:37,635
                        No.

484
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:41,071
Did you tell Kendra?

485
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:42,873
                 Absolutely not.
Oh, perfect. Great.

486
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,276
Now she can just sing a song
about me at her show.

487
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:47,211
     Speaking of which,
     you are going, right?

488
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:48,879
              Mom!

489
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,614
            Claire.
                        Mom.

490
00:25:50,616 --> 00:25:53,784
She's your sister.
    I know she's my sister, Mom.

491
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,556
     So, what?
     Sharon and Kendra both knew

492
00:25:58,558 --> 00:25:59,757
  and neither of them called me?

493
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:02,560
Would you have answered?

494
00:26:02,562 --> 00:26:04,862
I can't remember a time
when one of you

495
00:26:04,864 --> 00:26:06,931
wasn't hanging up on the other

496
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:09,867
or slamming the door
or walking out of a room.

497
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:12,269
Always misunderstanding.

498
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:14,171
Especially you, Claire.
              Me?

499
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:16,140
           Yes, you.

500
00:26:16,142 --> 00:26:19,176
   Gosh, I just would love it
   if one of you

501
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:21,245
   would just call the other
   and say,

502
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:24,815
 "Hi, how are you?
 Fine, thank you. How are you?

503
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:27,184
    "I'm good,
    and thanks for calling.

504
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:29,853
      "Oh, you're good?
      Oh, you deserve it.

505
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:31,155
    "Oh, and you know what,

506
00:26:31,157 --> 00:26:33,924
you look pretty in green."

507
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,993
        Pretty in green.
                 Yes.

508
00:26:35,995 --> 00:26:39,196
        Pretty in green.

509
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:42,600
           I'm sorry.

510
00:26:42,602 --> 00:26:44,768
            Oh, Mom.

511
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,037
          All I'm saying is that

512
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,907
       I know it's not Cambodia.

513
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:54,211
         I know it's not the end
         of the world,

514
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:57,381
     but, to me,
     it really feels like it is,

515
00:26:57,383 --> 00:26:59,984
     and I just
     have to deal with it alone.

516
00:26:59,986 --> 00:27:01,819
But where does it get you,
Claire?

517
00:27:01,821 --> 00:27:05,155
All that strife and warfare?

518
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:07,157
And I know
I don't always say the words

519
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:09,360
that you want to hear,
but I feel them.

520
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,098
             I know you do, Mom.

521
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:27,111
                       Here.

522
00:27:27,113 --> 00:27:30,681
             One more.
             That's it, no more.

523
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:37,755
                       Bam.

524
00:27:37,757 --> 00:27:39,189
Bam.

525
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:41,725
Bam.

526
00:27:41,727 --> 00:27:45,262
          Okay, Zippy,
          I'm going to get them.

527
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:48,198
Bam.

528
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:52,369
        I'm out of bullets, Zip.

529
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:54,171
         Running out of bullets.

530
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:02,179
It was nice of you to call.

531
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:04,181
            Oh, just missed you.

532
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:06,750
             Can't a father
             call his baby girl?

533
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:15,125
                 Honey...
What?

534
00:28:15,127 --> 00:28:19,063
 Could you please
 break the ice with your sister?

535
00:28:19,065 --> 00:28:21,732
Has she broken it with me?

536
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:24,034
I knew
there was a reason you called.

537
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:26,870
 She had just been going through
 a very rough time and I hear,

538
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:30,107
  and I cannot reveal the source
  to you,

539
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:31,875
           that you haven't been
           very supportive.

540
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:35,412
Uh-huh, who told you, Mom?
Sharon?

541
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:37,748
                      Esperanza.

542
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,817
        She tells me everything.

543
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:45,489
   What about me, Dad?

544
00:28:45,491 --> 00:28:48,092
My last boyfriend before Uri
wanted me to pretend

545
00:28:48,094 --> 00:28:49,793
   I was Jewel.

546
00:28:49,795 --> 00:28:51,228
What's wrong with my voice?

547
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,297
    I can sing.

548
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:56,934
I have pain too, you know,
you don't have to live in a car
to feel pain.

549
00:28:56,936 --> 00:29:00,871
        Oh, honey,
        I'm sorry you have pain.

550
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:04,308
Dad, I didn't get into the
Ashland Shakespeare Festival.

551
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,143
                No.
And with Claire and Lewis,

552
00:29:06,145 --> 00:29:08,178
and Sharon and her remodels,

553
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,748
I can't even have
my own tragedy.

554
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,851
           Well, hey,
           we're looking forward
           to your show.

555
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:18,021
 Honey, your mother
 and I love you very, very much.

556
00:29:18,023 --> 00:29:19,990
Do you, Dad?
                Uh-huh.

557
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:22,259
  'Cause sometimes I feel like
  I don't even have a family.

558
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:24,795
Sharon's always
too busy to talk to me

559
00:29:24,797 --> 00:29:27,431
and Claire never calls me back,
she just texts me.

560
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:29,032
            I know.
I can talk to you,

561
00:29:29,034 --> 00:29:31,835
  but you're not really there.

562
00:29:31,837 --> 00:29:33,437
          Honey.
It's okay.

563
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:36,974
Sharon was the love child
and Claire was planned

564
00:29:36,976 --> 00:29:39,009
and I was just the mistake.
It's totally--

565
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:40,377
            A wonderful mistake.

566
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:42,780
              No, not a mistake.
              I don't mean that.

567
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:45,916
      Come on. Sit down, please.

568
00:29:45,918 --> 00:29:48,352
      I have something
      I want to tell you.

569
00:29:48,354 --> 00:29:51,321
What, Dad? What?

570
00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:53,290
            Well...
<i> Hey.</i>

571
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,392
        Sorry I'm late.

572
00:29:55,394 --> 00:29:57,127
First I couldn't find my keys,

573
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:58,829
and then I couldn't find
my phone, and...

574
00:29:58,831 --> 00:30:01,298
Anyway, doesn't matter.
I'm here now.

575
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,902
 You're here.
 Now we'll just wait for Claire.

576
00:30:04,904 --> 00:30:06,370
            Claire.

577
00:30:06,372 --> 00:30:08,405
                           Yeah.
              Oh.

578
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:13,210
  Hi.

579
00:30:13,212 --> 00:30:15,245
       Always.

580
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:17,548
         Oh, God.
         Is there anything worse

581
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,583
          than driving to Venice
          on a Saturday?

582
00:30:19,585 --> 00:30:20,884
         I know, right.

583
00:30:20,886 --> 00:30:24,354
  I love Venice on a Saturday.

584
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:25,389
               Oh, good.

585
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:29,927
           My girls.

586
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:31,361
My beautiful girls.

587
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:37,301
   I'm glad you're all here.

588
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:40,871
How are you, honey?

589
00:30:40,873 --> 00:30:44,608
I'm terrible. Terrible.

590
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:46,343
             Um...

591
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,481
                      What, Dad?

592
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:55,953
           I have...

593
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,259
              What, Dad?

594
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:07,030
Okay, I don't want you
to get upset about this.

595
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:09,399
             Okay.

596
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:12,336
      They found a lump...

597
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,574
          on my lung.

598
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:25,482
But you don't smoke.

599
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:27,017
             I should have, huh?

600
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:30,220
It's not funny.

601
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:32,456
  I'm not trying to be funny.
  I just wanted to say

602
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:34,958
  that the reason I called you
  here together

603
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,629
 is that I don't want
 your mother to know about it.

604
00:31:38,631 --> 00:31:40,230
Yet.

605
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:42,232
      Now, I'll tell her
      when the time comes,

606
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,101
    when the time is right.

607
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:46,503
      I want us to all be
      on the same page
      about that now.

608
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:48,105
                           Okay?

609
00:31:48,107 --> 00:31:52,142
She's off hiking
with her friend Ellen right now.

610
00:31:52,144 --> 00:31:54,144
I don't understand.

611
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:57,514
   Kendra, let him--
   let him have his reasons.

612
00:31:57,516 --> 00:31:59,383
             I'm sorry, Dad.
     Thank you, honey.

613
00:31:59,385 --> 00:32:01,919
I'm sorry.
       I just wanna know
       what they are.

614
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:03,120
      It doesn't matter, Kendra.

615
00:32:03,122 --> 00:32:06,223
So you're asking us to lie.
                Omit.

616
00:32:06,225 --> 00:32:09,293
    I'm asking you to omit.
    I'm asking you
    not to say anything

617
00:32:09,295 --> 00:32:11,962
   until I-- I say something.

618
00:32:11,964 --> 00:32:14,364
 We're not telling her anything
 until we get you
 a second opinion.

619
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:17,200
I don't need a second opinion.
             We're gonna get you
             to a decent doctor

620
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:20,270
                and not the ones
                in your plan.
I don't need a second opinion.

621
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,506
         I'm asking you
         to help me.

622
00:32:22,508 --> 00:32:24,508
       What kind of ca--
       What do you have?

623
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,977
      How-- How bad is it?

624
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:29,947
              What are we
              gonna do about it?

625
00:32:29,949 --> 00:32:31,949
        There's nothing
        to do about it.

626
00:32:31,951 --> 00:32:33,417
         Yes, there is.

627
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:43,126
Daddy...

628
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,032
         are you dying?

629
00:32:49,034 --> 00:32:50,367
Kendra.

630
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:52,469
       I suppose so.

631
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,540
                    Here you go.

632
00:32:57,675 --> 00:33:01,745
But not till I eat this.

633
00:33:01,747 --> 00:33:04,348
I know.

634
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:07,651
          I just wanna know
          if we're gonna
          talk about it.

635
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:09,753
            Everybody
            grieves differently.

636
00:33:09,755 --> 00:33:12,289
           I just wanna know
           if she's gonna
           talk about it.

637
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:14,992
 I just don't talk about things
 the way you do, Kendra.

638
00:33:14,994 --> 00:33:17,060
          No, you run away.

639
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:19,763
                        Damn it.

640
00:33:19,765 --> 00:33:22,232
          I've gotta pick up
          Daisy from drum class.

641
00:33:22,234 --> 00:33:24,368
You're leaving?
                  Oh, shit.

642
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,271
Jesus. I gotta go.

643
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:32,142
My, uh, car
is on the street, so...

644
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:39,016
     Okay.

645
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,669
Shit.

646
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:09,212
          Eight bucks.

647
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:10,547
           How much?

648
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:12,549
                          Eight.
              Eight.

649
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,695
There you go, darling.

650
00:34:25,697 --> 00:34:27,397
Thank you.

651
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:24,287
There's my girl.

652
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,857
Let's get you
out of there.

653
00:35:26,859 --> 00:35:30,127
Yeah. Good girl.

654
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:32,796
Come on.

655
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:34,798
Let's go see
what's going on.

656
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,500
Let's go see
what's going on.

657
00:35:36,502 --> 00:35:39,503
Oops. Oh, yeah.

658
00:35:39,505 --> 00:35:41,638
          Ow.

659
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,511
There you go.

660
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,855
<i> Kitchen door open. </i>

661
00:35:58,857 --> 00:36:00,790
Sharon?

662
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:03,760
     <i> Kitchen door closed.</i>

663
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:16,373
Yeah. Okay.
                 You know what?
                 Forget it.

664
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:25,515
Hey, K.B.

665
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,217
                      Hi, Steve.

666
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:29,619
Sharon likes me
to wear these.

667
00:36:29,621 --> 00:36:32,289
Um...

668
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:34,558
         Esperanza, can you run
         a bath for her, please?

669
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,560
     Okay.
                      Thank you.

670
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:39,829
Kendra.

671
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:41,932
              Forgot your phone
              at the restaurant.
Ohh!

672
00:36:41,934 --> 00:36:44,601
Tsk! I can't believe I did that.
Can you believe this?

673
00:36:44,603 --> 00:36:46,303
I can believe it.

674
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:49,806
           Anyway, I didn't mean
           to act like,

675
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:52,742
      you know, the Dad thing
      wasn't a priority for you.

676
00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:55,212
It's fine.

677
00:36:55,214 --> 00:36:56,880
                     It's just--
Really.

678
00:36:56,882 --> 00:37:00,217
        What am I supposed to do
        if Mom asks
        why I'm acting weird?

679
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:02,719
You're gonna
have to do some acting.
You're an actress.

680
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:06,323
               Right. Right.

681
00:37:06,325 --> 00:37:07,824
     Act about what?

682
00:37:07,826 --> 00:37:09,359
                        Nothing.

683
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:13,430
Just...

684
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,302
              My dad has cancer.

685
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:22,639
What?

686
00:37:22,641 --> 00:37:24,941
                 Sharon?
Kendra, sit down.

687
00:37:24,943 --> 00:37:26,943
         I don't wanna sit down.

688
00:37:26,945 --> 00:37:29,479
    Why didn't you tell me?

689
00:37:29,481 --> 00:37:31,881
            Ohh.
I didn't wanna say it.

690
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:34,918
                           Lung.

691
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,822
Oh, I-- I'm so sorry.
If there's, uh,

692
00:37:38,824 --> 00:37:41,291
             anything we can do,
             obviously...

693
00:37:41,293 --> 00:37:44,494
             Some things
             you just can't fix.

694
00:37:44,496 --> 00:37:46,696
No-- Of course.

695
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:49,566
   I don't suggest that I
   have the cure for cancer.
   I'm just--

696
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:52,002
   I just meant that if things--
   when things get dicey--

697
00:37:52,004 --> 00:37:54,738
                 They are dicey.

698
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,906
     He meant dicier.
                             I--

699
00:37:56,908 --> 00:37:58,675
Dicier.

700
00:37:58,677 --> 00:38:01,478
                  Okay, well...

701
00:38:03,482 --> 00:38:05,882
          I need to go feed Dow.

702
00:38:05,884 --> 00:38:07,884
                     Yeah.

703
00:38:07,886 --> 00:38:09,886
              Who's-- Who's Dow?

704
00:38:09,888 --> 00:38:13,490
Her fish.
                      Her fish.

705
00:38:13,492 --> 00:38:15,792
Kendra...

706
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:24,701
So, did you talk
to Claire?

707
00:38:24,703 --> 00:38:27,704
           No, but I don't wanna
           talk about Claire
           when she's not here.

708
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:28,705
Okay.

709
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:40,850
Hey.

710
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:50,560
          I tried to call, but--
What do you need, Lewis?

711
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:56,833
        I feel really bad
        about everything, and...

712
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:03,640
       You all packed?
Uh...

713
00:39:03,642 --> 00:39:05,642
A few things. Yeah.
I just...

714
00:39:05,644 --> 00:39:07,711
I thought the sooner,
the better.

715
00:39:07,713 --> 00:39:11,681
    Oh, I just mean that it'd be
    easier for you to move on.

716
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,352
I didn't wanna move on,
Lewis.

717
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:19,522
I was happy.

718
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:21,991
             No, you weren't.

719
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,562
      So I'm the bad one, right?
Yes!

720
00:39:25,564 --> 00:39:28,531
Yes, you're the bad one,
Lewis!

721
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:30,934
I...

722
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:34,537
     I got you that shirt.

723
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:37,040
     Hey, Claire,
     I, uh, just wanted to say
     I spoke with the landlord--

724
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:39,042
Oh, fuck off.

725
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:42,112
                       Cool.

726
00:39:42,114 --> 00:39:44,114
          Here we go.
          Oh, FYI,

727
00:39:44,116 --> 00:39:47,851
   Aloha Gym/Spa
   is half price on Mondays.

728
00:39:47,853 --> 00:39:50,387
   And I hear that cucumber bath
   at the Oasis

729
00:39:50,389 --> 00:39:51,955
           is out of this world.

730
00:39:51,957 --> 00:39:54,023
Uh, yes,
there is spear fishing,

731
00:39:54,025 --> 00:39:56,092
but you've gotta get
a license first.

732
00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:57,727
Snack bar's open till 4:00.

733
00:39:57,729 --> 00:40:01,931
Room service is available.
But $12 for a papaya.

734
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:03,566
         So...
                           Yeah.

735
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:05,802
Kids, there's an arcade
and dolphins--

736
00:40:05,804 --> 00:40:08,138
Oh, and I got you some gum.

737
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,873
    You never wanna buy this
    at the airport.

738
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:11,808
Highway robbery.
Get in the car.

739
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,510
                Say "thank you."
                      Thank you.

740
00:40:13,512 --> 00:40:15,945
You're welcome.
Didn't you all have a red bag?

741
00:40:15,947 --> 00:40:18,581
Oh, shit.
I thought you had it.
I told you to get the bag.

742
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,717
                 Hello, Officer.
                 How are you?
Hello. How are you?

743
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:22,719
              We're leaving
              right this minute.
Okay.

744
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:24,921
            I saw the temporary
            "no parking" signs--
Mm-hmm.

745
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,457
             ...but these people
             actually live here,

746
00:40:27,459 --> 00:40:29,125
             and this was just
             a 15-second pickup.

747
00:40:29,127 --> 00:40:31,127
                 I'm taking them
                 to the airport.

748
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:33,863
   But as you see,
   their car is in the driveway,

749
00:40:33,865 --> 00:40:36,099
      so I could not park there,
      because

750
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:38,802
they don't want people to know
  they're gonna be away.

751
00:40:38,804 --> 00:40:40,870
Right.
      So, I couldn't park there.

752
00:40:40,872 --> 00:40:42,605
        This was my only option.

753
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:45,008
Yeah, but this is the one place
you can't park, though.

754
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:48,111
            But you know what?
            We're leaving now.
            So no harm, no foul.

755
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:50,113
               We're outta here.
               Oh, great, honey.

756
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:52,949
        Thank you.
        Could you do me a favor?
        This is a little sticky.

757
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:55,785
       Could you?
       I'd really appreciate it.
Yeah. Yeah, I can do that.

758
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:58,555
                All right. Good.
                Oh, thank you.

759
00:40:58,557 --> 00:41:00,957
See this little petoolah?

760
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,859
           How cute is she, huh?
   Yeah.

761
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:05,929
That's my granddaughter Daisy.

762
00:41:05,931 --> 00:41:08,031
She's adopted.

763
00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:13,570
Not being able
to have a child--

764
00:41:13,572 --> 00:41:18,141
it just tore my daughter,
Sharon, apart.

765
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:22,679
Okay, seat belts, everybody.

766
00:41:22,681 --> 00:41:26,850
You know, I just wanna
    thank you for listening.

767
00:41:26,852 --> 00:41:29,853
   So few people do anymore.

768
00:41:29,855 --> 00:41:32,155
All right. Have a good day.
     Drive safe.

769
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:35,225
       Off to the races.
       Here we go.

770
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:40,830
So, what's Dad
up to today?

771
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:44,000
     Oh, staying out of trouble,
     hopefully.

772
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:46,002
          He calls all day long.

773
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:48,538
      "Where are you?
      When are you coming home?"

774
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:52,108
                Then I get home,
                he doesn't talk.

775
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:55,278
Well, maybe he just
needs you there.

776
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,214
               He's-- He's okay.

777
00:41:58,216 --> 00:42:01,084
I have a theory about why Dad
   doesn't want Mom to know.

778
00:42:01,086 --> 00:42:03,553
He's got his head
in the sand.

779
00:42:03,555 --> 00:42:05,555
                No, it's because
                it's a secret.

780
00:42:05,557 --> 00:42:08,291
        You know, everybody's
        just gotta have a secret
        from somebody else

781
00:42:08,293 --> 00:42:10,827
  so the other person can be mad
  when the secret comes out.

782
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:14,531
    It's like, you know,
    it just should've never been
    a secret in the first place.

783
00:42:14,533 --> 00:42:16,866
I saw Mom earlier.
It was horrible.

784
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:20,069
           Oh, God. I'm avoiding
           her calls completely.

785
00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:23,206
Kendra's having
a hard time with it.

786
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:26,976
              Are you...
              talking to Kendra?

787
00:42:26,978 --> 00:42:29,646
Well, not talking talking,
but...

788
00:42:29,648 --> 00:42:32,682
I don't think we should
talk about Kendra
when she's not here.

789
00:42:32,684 --> 00:42:34,884
                     Okay. Um...

790
00:42:37,756 --> 00:42:39,756
                     I gotta go.

791
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:46,229
Hey, uh, we should,
um, talk more.

792
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:48,765
               Yeah. Definitely.
   Call me.

793
00:42:48,767 --> 00:42:51,200
                   Okay. I will.

794
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:57,206
     Sharon, I really
     don't want Daisy
     seeing you smoking a joint.

795
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:59,709
    She's eight months old.

796
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:02,011
           Patti Smith remembers
           her mother's screams
           when she was born.

797
00:43:02,013 --> 00:43:04,714
  Since when do you
  start reading<i> Rolling Stone?</i>

798
00:43:04,716 --> 00:43:07,016
I do.

799
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:28,371
              How are your
              fantastic parents?

800
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:31,941
Fine. Yeah,
everyone is really--

801
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:35,011
    I remember your dad
    came down to the campus jail

802
00:43:35,013 --> 00:43:37,013
        to bail me out of a DUI.

803
00:43:37,015 --> 00:43:39,015
              He's the greatest.

804
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:43,286
           He is.

805
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:46,990
       And how are your sisters?
       Are they still weird?

806
00:43:46,992 --> 00:43:49,125
            Um...

807
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:51,127
You know,
they're not weird, actually.

808
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:53,329
Uh, Sharon is doing really well.

809
00:43:53,331 --> 00:43:56,733
   She has a baby now,
   which is really exciting.

810
00:43:56,735 --> 00:43:58,735
And Kendra is still acting,

811
00:43:58,737 --> 00:44:01,704
and she's actually
really talented--
                        Hey.

812
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:05,708
       Oh, my God.

813
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:07,043
                    Yeah.

814
00:44:07,045 --> 00:44:09,078
Oh, my God.
                    I signed it.

815
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:13,116
          Oh, my God.

816
00:44:13,118 --> 00:44:16,819
Kate, this is just amazing.

817
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:19,689
It's so heavy.

818
00:44:19,691 --> 00:44:22,792
             I had to cut a lot.
         Really?

819
00:44:22,794 --> 00:44:26,229
            I can't tell you
            how many dead bodies
            I've seen.

820
00:44:26,231 --> 00:44:28,865
         Kate...

821
00:44:28,867 --> 00:44:31,067
  This is so awkward. I...

822
00:44:31,069 --> 00:44:33,936
You know,
we came up together...

823
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:37,440
    and I introduced you
    to the newsroom

824
00:44:37,442 --> 00:44:40,209
      and all those people
      that I knew--

825
00:44:40,211 --> 00:44:43,179
     I'm so sorry
     they couldn't keep us both.

826
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:48,951
   Yeah. Yeah.
   That was really hard.

827
00:44:48,953 --> 00:44:50,987
           Um...

828
00:44:50,989 --> 00:44:54,023
 You know, I didn't really have
 the thick skin for it,

829
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:57,026
   and I think that I do now.

830
00:44:57,028 --> 00:45:01,798
      So... I've decided
      to move to New York.

831
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:10,940
      Okay. Um, I don't
      really know anybody,

832
00:45:10,942 --> 00:45:15,344
  and it would be really great
  to have a friend.

833
00:45:15,346 --> 00:45:18,715
And if you could, you know,
maybe put in a good word for me
or something,

834
00:45:18,717 --> 00:45:21,184
I feel like--
                    Wow.

835
00:45:21,186 --> 00:45:24,053
            That's a big move.

836
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:28,224
               And you're 29.

837
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:31,761
           But I will definitely
           ask around.

838
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:35,298
        Thank you.

839
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:40,136
            Sometimes...
            we miss our calling.

840
00:45:40,138 --> 00:45:42,138
      Yeah. We do.

841
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:43,406

00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:04,494
It's my dad.

850
00:46:04,496 --> 00:46:09,298
They found something
on his lung.

851
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,000
                           No...

852
00:46:11,002 --> 00:46:13,102
And we're not allowed
to talk about it.

853
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:15,872
So now we're not talking
even more than when not talking.

854
00:46:15,874 --> 00:46:19,342
And I just feel so alone.

855
00:46:19,344 --> 00:46:21,010
               You're not alone.
               Kendra--

856
00:46:21,012 --> 00:46:22,111
    I--
                         Kendra!

857
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,949
<i> ��</i>

858
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:47,069
         How you doing?

859
00:46:47,071 --> 00:46:48,538
     Okay.

860
00:46:50,007 --> 00:46:52,175
                Anyone talk
                to your mom yet?

861
00:46:52,177 --> 00:46:53,876
No, not yet.

862
00:46:53,878 --> 00:46:56,078
I called, but I hung up.

863
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,314
         Doesn't seem very fair.

864
00:46:58,316 --> 00:47:00,283
I have to respect
my dad's wishes.

865
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:07,056
       And what about P-A-V-E-L?

866
00:47:07,058 --> 00:47:11,260
        Are you gonna
        R-E-S-P-E-C-T P-A-V-E-L?

867
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:16,232
What are you talking a--
Oh, God.

868
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:20,002
You heard that?
            On the baby monitor.

869
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:22,305
               Yeah. I heard it.
     Ohh!

870
00:47:22,307 --> 00:47:24,307
Steve, that--

871
00:47:24,309 --> 00:47:27,009
that's just
a figure of speech.

872
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:28,978
                   "I wanna f"--

873
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:31,581
 "I wanna F-U-C-K everyone else"
 is not a figure of speech.

874
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:34,217
   You can check any phrase book
   anyplace in the world.

875
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:36,452
 Like, is "I wanna fuck everyone
 else" a figure of speech?
I'm sorry.

876
00:47:36,454 --> 00:47:38,588
             No, never heard it.
             Mm-hmm.

877
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:40,890
Look, I've got
a lot of stuff on my mind.

878
00:47:40,892 --> 00:47:43,159
            Okay, let's hear it.
            Okay.
Okay.

879
00:47:43,161 --> 00:47:45,628
And I feel that we
are at a crossroads.

880
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:47,864
          What? Come on, Sharon.

881
00:47:47,866 --> 00:47:49,899
                   "Crossroads"?

882
00:47:49,901 --> 00:47:51,934
  Do you remember when we
  used to drink and have fun?

883
00:47:51,936 --> 00:47:55,004
       Yeah. So you know what?
       Let's drink and have fun.

884
00:47:55,006 --> 00:47:56,539
            I can't.

885
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:58,641
I don't know why,
but I can't.

886
00:47:58,643 --> 00:48:02,111
      Why are we always--
      Why are we always
      moving windows?

887
00:48:02,113 --> 00:48:04,614
To fill the void?

888
00:48:04,616 --> 00:48:06,415
                "Fill the void?"

889
00:48:06,417 --> 00:48:10,419
My head is burning.
           Sharon, take a class.

890
00:48:10,421 --> 00:48:13,256
I don't want to take a class.
       You need
       intellectual stimulation.

891
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:18,628
Hitler is not an aphrodisiac.
That's all I'm saying.

892
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:22,899
       I don't wanna run around
       worrying about
       how to turn you on, okay?

893
00:48:22,901 --> 00:48:26,035
           Hopefully, I just--
           Hopefully, I just do.

894
00:48:26,037 --> 00:48:29,906
Well, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize
you were running around,

895
00:48:29,908 --> 00:48:32,208
worried about
how to turn me on.
              No, no. No. Mm-mm.

896
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:34,644
   You're twisting. Don't twist.
I've never seen you
worry about that.

897
00:48:34,646 --> 00:48:36,913
      That's not what I-- Mm-mm.
      That's not what I said.

898
00:48:36,915 --> 00:48:40,182
Why is the TV always on?
            The TV is my friend.

899
00:48:40,184 --> 00:48:43,386
That was mean.

900
00:48:45,223 --> 00:48:47,523
I wanna get a job.
                    Okay.

901
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:54,297
I can't leave Daisy.
                   Okay.

902
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:59,168
I hate everything
I say.

903
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:00,937
                Okay.

904
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:10,146
Oh...

905
00:49:10,148 --> 00:49:16,218
� You stayed
through wear and tear �

906
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:19,088
� Through every busted day �

907
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:21,657
� An angel to my devil �

908
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:23,693
� Kept my secrets tucked away �

909
00:49:23,695 --> 00:49:25,962
- So stylish.
- Oh, my goodness.

910
00:49:25,964 --> 00:49:27,430
            My stylish daughter.
  Oh...

911
00:49:27,432 --> 00:49:29,966
   Ohhh!
       That's my beautiful girl.

912
00:49:29,968 --> 00:49:32,401
Yeah.

913
00:49:32,403 --> 00:49:34,403
          So...

914
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,975
  have you talked to Mom?

915
00:49:38,977 --> 00:49:42,178
              Soon, honey. Soon.

916
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:45,214
     No need to worry a worrier.

917
00:49:46,616 --> 00:49:50,353
       And how about you?
       How are you doing?

918
00:49:50,355 --> 00:49:53,689
          Fine. Good. Feel good.

919
00:49:53,691 --> 00:49:57,293
Really?
                Yeah. Really.

920
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:04,600
   You're gonna get this back...
   with interest.

921
00:50:04,602 --> 00:50:07,603
Oh, really, Dad,
what's the point of having it
if you can't share it?

922
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:10,339
              That's right.

923
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:13,776
� You never ran, thank God �

924
00:50:13,778 --> 00:50:16,412
  � You stuck by me �

925
00:50:16,414 --> 00:50:21,550
� Angels are looking down
and watching over me �

926
00:50:21,552 --> 00:50:28,257
� Angels are looking down
and watching over me �

927
00:50:28,259 --> 00:50:30,559
Yes, they are.

928
00:50:33,597 --> 00:50:35,498
Robert!

929
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,333
       I didn't know
       you were coming in today.

930
00:50:37,335 --> 00:50:40,069
   I just wanted to check in,
   say hello.

931
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:43,205
Hey, Doc.
    Hey, Bob.
    How you feeling?

932
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:45,374
             Well, I'm good.
             I feel good.

933
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:46,642
                    Have a seat.
Okay.

934
00:50:46,644 --> 00:50:49,745
        Do you want some coffee?
            Oh, sweetheart, yes.

935
00:50:49,747 --> 00:50:53,582
Um, Dad,
we don't really call nurses
"sweetheart" anymore,

936
00:50:53,584 --> 00:50:55,551
because it's not 1910.

937
00:50:55,553 --> 00:50:57,486
                   No, we don't?
                   No, we don't.
    Mm-mm.

938
00:50:57,488 --> 00:51:00,356
Okay.

939
00:51:00,358 --> 00:51:02,358
            Okay?
                         Mm-hmm.

940
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:05,494
Okay.

941
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:16,705
Dad...

942
00:51:16,707 --> 00:51:20,342
why is Lewis calling you?

943
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:26,215
    We just had some business...
    to tie up--

944
00:51:26,217 --> 00:51:28,684
What kind of business?
                    Well...

945
00:51:28,686 --> 00:51:32,521
we, uh, made a little investment
together last year.

946
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,826
              Koa. K-O-A. Koa.

947
00:51:36,828 --> 00:51:39,695
         The most beautiful wood
         in the world...

948
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:44,400
  grows on the top of a mountain
  in Kauai.

949
00:51:44,402 --> 00:51:48,370
        When harvested properly,
        it's worth a fortune.

950
00:51:48,372 --> 00:51:50,706
                And I had an in.

951
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:53,742
          I told Lewis about it,

952
00:51:53,744 --> 00:51:58,214
  and he decided that he wanted
  to make an investment with me.

953
00:51:58,216 --> 00:52:01,417
                            Huh.
               Okay.

954
00:52:01,419 --> 00:52:03,519
So, what happened with it, then?

955
00:52:03,521 --> 00:52:08,124
          Well, it's a very
          complicated operation.

956
00:52:08,126 --> 00:52:10,860
          You need lumberjacks
          to cut the trees down.

957
00:52:10,862 --> 00:52:14,630
       Then you need helicopters
       to bring the trees
       down off the mountain.

958
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:17,766
        Then it turns out
        that the guy on the hill
        is a pot farmer.

959
00:52:17,768 --> 00:52:22,538
He was emotionally unstable.

960
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:25,541
                  He was a mess.

961
00:52:25,543 --> 00:52:27,776
           It was gonna
           make us zillionaires.

962
00:52:30,414 --> 00:52:32,414
  Oh, Dad.
           I know.
           You wanna yell at me.

963
00:52:32,416 --> 00:52:34,717
           I can feel it.
           Go ahead. Yell at me.

964
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:37,553
It's okay.

965
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:42,424
         I wanna yell at me.

966
00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:51,400
       All right, Bob. Let's get
       some deep breaths, okay?
     Okay.

967
00:52:51,402 --> 00:52:53,302
Deep breath in,
               deep breath out.

968
00:52:53,304 --> 00:52:54,637
There you go.

969
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,473
                     Hello.

970
00:52:57,475 --> 00:52:59,808
             <i> Hey.</i>

971
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:01,577
           Hey. Hey, Claire.

972
00:53:01,579 --> 00:53:03,445
                         Um, hi.

973
00:53:03,447 --> 00:53:05,781
             I was just calling,

974
00:53:05,783 --> 00:53:08,317
             'cause, uh,
             my dad just told me

975
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:12,221
            about the Koa thing.

976
00:53:12,223 --> 00:53:16,559
    So I-- I guess I just wanted
    to say thank you,

977
00:53:16,561 --> 00:53:18,527
         <i> I guess.</i>

978
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:21,830
Yeah. I mean, he--
You know, he's an impossible guy
to turn down.

979
00:53:21,832 --> 00:53:24,700
Yeah.

980
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:28,370
            I, uh--
            I meant to call you.

981
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:30,940
     <i> Meaning to call you. </i>
              Really?

982
00:53:30,942 --> 00:53:33,676
  <i> I-- I, uh--</i>
  <i> I heard about him being sick,</i>
