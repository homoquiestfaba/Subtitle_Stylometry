1
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:43,976
Mr. snuffles, what do you
have to say for yourself?

2
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:53,619
You're so silly.

3
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:05,998
There you are.

4
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:19,645
Of course not, we're the
bestest friends forever, ever.

5
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:26,952
I'll always be true.

6
00:01:33,928 --> 00:01:36,495
Who are you talking
with, Princess?

7
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:38,897
Just with my dolls, mommy.

8
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:40,899
Get some sleep, darling.

9
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:43,469
We have a big day ahead of us.

10
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,377
So that went well.

11
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:01,847
Are you okay?

12
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,416
I'm okay.

13
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,790
So what did Hodges say, any
legal problems about probate?

14
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,692
Nope, it's all done,

15
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:19,097
wrapped up in a pretty
legal bow with my signature.

16
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:27,973
I'm sorry, sweetheart,
that was inconsiderate.

17
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:31,610
Where would you like to
go, anywhere, just name it.

18
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:33,579
Home, I'm going home.

19
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:48,353
Hey, miss Mason,
some of your students

20
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:49,955
want to say goodbye.

21
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,257
Bye, we love you!

22
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:53,859
Bye, miss Mason!

23
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:09,508
We're here, baby.

24
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:13,679
Wake up, sleepyhead.

25
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:16,515
You know me and long car rides.

26
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,451
You excited to be home?

27
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:29,594
Yeah, something like that.

28
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:27,018
Well, come in.

29
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,592
Let's get some
lights on in here.

30
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:36,896
All right.

31
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:42,167
Huh.

32
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:44,669
Time to buy some light bulbs.

33
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:01,553
And what is behind
door number one?

34
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:03,889
Can we make sure that the
kitchen and bathroom work

35
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:05,690
before we go exploring?

36
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:09,928
Otherwise, we need to go to
a hotel, I need to shower.

37
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:13,098
Shower it is, okay, baby.

38
00:07:58,077 --> 00:07:59,845
That's one down.

39
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:02,514
Now a shower for milady.

40
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,803
I can't believe this is you.

41
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,608
That is some big hair.

42
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,110
How come you never showed
me this pic before?

43
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:34,613
- Because it's not me.
- What?

44
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:37,015
That's her, that's mother.

45
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:42,355
Huh.

46
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:47,125
She's got a lot of
these laying around.

47
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:51,930
They're all of her.

48
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,766
They always were.

49
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:02,607
You two could be sisters.

50
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:08,280
I'm an only child.

51
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:16,154
Tea, extra honey.

52
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:17,222
Thank you.

53
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:22,260
Looking at pics of
a supermodel, I see.

54
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:24,429
She seemed to think so.

55
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,600
You never really
talked about her much.

56
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:30,268
There's a reason.

57
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,905
Care to share?

58
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,741
Mother only cared
about what she wanted,

59
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,443
not what I wanted.

60
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:40,812
She was impossible to be around.

61
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:43,181
That sounds like all mothers.

62
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:46,484
I mean, you know mine,
all she ever does

63
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:50,388
is guilt-trip me and
tell me to have kids and,

64
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:54,960
uh, send me corned
beef and cabbage.

65
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:57,429
She wanted to be around you.

66
00:09:57,431 --> 00:10:00,398
I got so lonely, I had
an imaginary friend.

67
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,000
- Really?
- Yeah.

68
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:03,969
Her name was Bethany.

69
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:07,939
What, no neighborhood
kids or kids from school?

70
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,841
I was home-schooled,

71
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:13,345
and playing with other
children was unladylike.

72
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:15,380
Wow, my mom is starting to
sound a lot less annoying.

73
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:18,350
I wouldn't go that far, you
remember last Thanksgiving?

74
00:10:18,352 --> 00:10:22,153
Yikes, yes, I do, and
her cell phone rings

75
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:24,289
to the stabbing
music from psycho.

76
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:42,874
This is a big decision,
we need to talk about it.

77
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,376
No, we don't.

78
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:46,478
Yes, we do, Claire.

79
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,848
Look, baby, I love you...
and I love you, Aaron.

80
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,917
That's not the question here,
it never is, it never was.

81
00:10:56,289 --> 00:11:00,091
I think that we should deal
with things one thing at a time,

82
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:03,194
and this house is a big
enough thing to deal with,

83
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:04,829
so can we please
just deal with that...

84
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,166
I am, and you're
right, it is a big thing.

85
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,902
It's a great big thing
that we talked about

86
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:13,772
and agreed upon
before we moved here.

87
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:15,707
Well, it's different now.

88
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:16,709
How?

89
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:19,944
- It's better.
- For you, maybe.

90
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:21,680
For me, this house...

91
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:25,016
it's the best break
we've ever gotten.

92
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,185
Being here feels wrong,

93
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:30,822
off,

94
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,726
like I'm walking through
someone else's memory of life

95
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:37,662
and I don't want it to be mine.

96
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,900
I'm sorry, sweetie.

97
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,536
I am.

98
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:49,107
But the reality is,
this house is old,

99
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,445
it needs a lot of work

100
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:56,014
before it could make any
money on today's market,

101
00:11:56,016 --> 00:11:58,049
but for us,

102
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,719
it's priceless, we've won
the lottery here, sweetie.

103
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:02,454
Yeah, well, when
you win the lottery,

104
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:03,722
you cash in the ticket,

105
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:05,824
you don't move into
the fucking 7-Eleven.

106
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:07,125
Don't.

107
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:09,728
Don't storm off like
that's your final word.

108
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,263
I left my friends and business
to come here with you,

109
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:14,666
as well, so don't act like you're
the only one on the cross.

110
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,251
Goodnight, Bethany.

111
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:13,658
Claire, I think you're

112
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,527
deflecting the question.

113
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:18,263
Remember, my office
is a safe place.

114
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:22,467
The only thing that matters
here is honesty to ourselves.

115
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:25,837
No one is perfect in
the eyes of the world,

116
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,307
so let's address the
monster in the room.

117
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:34,145
You want to have a
child with Aaron?

118
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,918
Yes, I do, just not right now.

119
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:46,124
Is that because last time,

120
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:48,126
the baby was stillborn?

121
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,430
No, it's because I don't want

122
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:54,999
to have a child in this house.

123
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:57,235
Why?

124
00:13:57,237 --> 00:14:00,271
Because I don't want
to become my mother.

125
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:03,274
And having a child in
this house would do that?

126
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:05,243
I mean, that's crazy.
Do not call me that.

127
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:08,780
I'm not calling you crazy,
I'm saying the thought process

128
00:14:08,782 --> 00:14:11,082
is crazy...
well, it's the same thing.

129
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:14,052
That's good,
Claire, you're angry.

130
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:16,221
Now let's talk about why.

131
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:25,163
I cut both of my wrists
after my baby was born dead.

132
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:32,003
I was filled with pain
and anguish and hormones,

133
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:35,173
and I lashed out at
myself to end it.

134
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:40,445
And I have come to terms with
that, it's part of who I am,

135
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:44,549
but it is not why I don't want
to have a baby in this house.

136
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,451
Good, good.

137
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:48,586
So, let's figure out why.

138
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:55,326
What do you think it might be?

139
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,731
Claire?

140
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,567
Honey?

141
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,036
I'm sorry.

142
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:07,772
It's not your fault, Aaron,

143
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:09,774
and anger isn't
always a bad thing.

144
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:11,009
It's progress.

145
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,878
- Really?
- Absolutely!

146
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,346
Her anger will pass,

147
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:19,918
but the moment will be fertile
ground for contemplation.

148
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,753
Just be patient.

149
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,757
Okay.

150
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,158
Okay, thank you.

151
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:46,978
She always prides beauty
and status above all else.

152
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:50,882
These were your mother's?

153
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:52,784
No, these were mine.

154
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,654
What are they for?

155
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,825
- Beauty pageants.
- Beauty pageants, huh?

156
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:02,827
How come I never
knew about this?

157
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:06,631
Because I did them
when I was a little kid.

158
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:11,669
That's just, that's just cruel,

159
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,573
making a little girl for fight

160
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:18,309
for the validation of strangers.

161
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:26,317
That's all my
mother cared about.

162
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:29,687
I'm sorry, honey.

163
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:31,990
This is it.

164
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,225
This is my life.

165
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,872
You see, she's
won every pageant,

166
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:49,574
and she's only just begun.

167
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:51,776
Her accolades are
quite impressive.

168
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:53,511
Yes, she's my perfect girl.

169
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:54,846
Do a pirouette.

170
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,149
Very impressive indeed.

171
00:16:58,151 --> 00:17:00,418
Thank you, miss Freedman,
I also do gymnastics...

172
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,887
oh, that's enough, you can go.

173
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:05,723
Nice to meet you, miss Freedman.

174
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:08,292
You too, sweetie.

175
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:11,029
You know, she would be
the perfect poster child

176
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,097
for your pageant this year.

177
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,565
She is darling.

178
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:16,401
I'll see what I can do, Susan.

179
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:20,271
You know, I think that you
can do more than just see.

180
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:22,173
I can't accept that.

181
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,775
Of course you can.

182
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:27,111
This is her life,
it's all she has.

183
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:31,316
Good.

184
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:33,351
Tea?

185
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:35,219
All right.

186
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:02,313
Don't worry, I'm pretty
sure we can streamline

187
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:03,681
your workflow and
get your office

188
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:06,284
up and running in no time, bye.

189
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:08,686
- Potential new client?
- Potential huge new client.

190
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:11,923
They me to bid on
the entire building.

191
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:17,462
That's fantastic.

192
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:19,630
What did I tell you,
good things ahead.

193
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:23,868
- I'm really excited for you.
- For us, this could be huge.

194
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:36,214
I'll be back soon.

195
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,283
And think about it.

196
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:11,242
Get it.

197
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:54,919
You know, Gary's
been here five years

198
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:58,189
and he's never made a
cross-platform proposal like that.

199
00:20:58,191 --> 00:21:00,324
I mean, the guy looks
and talks like Mr. Magoo,

200
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:02,827
but baby, he's in.
That's great, honey.

201
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:05,263
He's in, he's down,
and he's on board.

202
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:07,932
Their infrastructure,
it's a dinosaur.

203
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:11,202
Their bandwidth's a joke,
the hardware is aztec,

204
00:21:11,204 --> 00:21:13,604
but they just had a massive
acquisition of their ip,

205
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,306
and guess who bought them.

206
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:16,240
Uh...

207
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:17,775
come on, guess, guess, guess.

208
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,144
Who's your favorite
search engine,

209
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:23,114
that makes cyborg eyewear and
wants to cheer for a march?

210
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,616
- Goo...
- Yeah, that's it!

211
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,786
But don't say anything
because, you know,

212
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:32,256
they might have
bugged the house.

213
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:33,824
I mean, I'm kidding,
I'm kidding,

214
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:35,993
but we've got to keep it
on the down-low for now.

215
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:38,095
I mean, this is a complete
reboot of the entire facility

216
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:39,730
and they want me to do it, me.

217
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:43,434
Holy crap, I think I
know how your mom felt

218
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:46,404
when she won miss apple pie.

219
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:47,872
Apple festival.

220
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,574
Exactly, except my crown will

221
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:52,643
be made out of
fiber-optic cable.

222
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,178
Financial stability, baby.

223
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,846
Think about it, you
won't even have to work,

224
00:21:55,848 --> 00:21:57,248
you won't even have to work!

225
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,816
You can be a mom,
like we talked about,

226
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,551
you know, a stay-at-home mom.

227
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:02,620
Of course, you'll want
to get out of the house,

228
00:22:02,622 --> 00:22:04,422
get to the gym, take
care of yourself.

229
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:05,923
You gotta take care

230
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:07,825
of your body, keep you in good
shape, you know what I mean,

231
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,293
sweetheart?

232
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:10,795
Want to keep you pretty and ripe

233
00:22:10,797 --> 00:22:12,430
like a little apple doll,

234
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:14,699
my little apple,
fresh little darling.

235
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:49,133
No, no, no, no, no, no!

236
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:52,370
No, no, no, no, no, get off!

237
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:55,439
They're gonna eat me...
baby, hey!

238
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:57,308
What are you looking at?
They're on me.

239
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,110
Claire, you're okay, Claire!

240
00:22:59,112 --> 00:23:01,712
There's nothing here,
sweetie, there's nothing here,

241
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:04,582
sweetheart, there's
nothing here, it's just,

242
00:23:04,584 --> 00:23:07,017
it's just us.

243
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:09,887
- It's just us.
- It's just us, you're safe.

244
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:13,457
Just you and me.

245
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:15,493
Okay, okay.

246
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:19,363
Do you want to lay down?

247
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:23,033
Okay.

248
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:26,604
You want me to
bring you some tea?

249
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:28,839
Okay, it's okay.

250
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,576
It's all right.

251
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:41,519
- Sorry, I don't know...
- Hush, it's okay.

252
00:23:41,521 --> 00:23:42,987
I'll be right up.

253
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:58,002
I'm really proud of you, Aaron.

254
00:23:58,004 --> 00:24:02,106
You work really hard,
they're lucky to have you.

255
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:03,674
Thank you, baby.

256
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,970
Make sure you use the blush.

257
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,840
A Princess always makes sure

258
00:26:16,842 --> 00:26:20,244
that her cheeks are
like perfect roses.

259
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:28,619
Gently, child.

260
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:33,057
We don't want to
look like a whore.

261
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:35,125
Wipe it clean and do it again.

262
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:36,360
Yes, mother.

263
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:41,899
Again!

264
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,870
Claire, are you okay?

265
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,940
Yeah.

266
00:27:58,243 --> 00:27:59,243
Yeah, I'm,

267
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:05,249
I'm fine, I'm just looking
at something, I guess.

268
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,119
As long as you're all right,

269
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:11,255
I'm just a little
concerned for you.

270
00:28:11,257 --> 00:28:12,257
Yeah.

271
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,359
Thanks.

272
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:17,394
I just, um,

273
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:20,764
I mean, I don't know.

274
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:27,404
Yeah, I get that.

275
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:32,476
So,

276
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:35,779
this is your old room, huh?

277
00:28:35,781 --> 00:28:36,781
Yeah.

278
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,255
Were you a little
person your whole life

279
00:28:45,257 --> 00:28:47,424
before we started dating?

280
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,895
I know, it's weird.

281
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,631
Weird, yeah.

282
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,735
But seriously, you were how
old when you moved down...

283
00:28:57,737 --> 00:28:58,737
- 17.
- 17.

284
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:01,572
I was 17 years old before

285
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:04,408
I stood up to her
and walked out.

286
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:07,044
I just don't see you playing

287
00:29:07,046 --> 00:29:11,815
with dolls and stuffed
animals when you were 17.

288
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:15,486
I kind of see you as
more of a cherry bomb.

289
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:21,959
A hot chick with a bad attitude.

290
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:22,961
You know.

291
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:28,332
Yeah, that was me.

292
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:42,346
So you're not the one who
left your room in a time warp?

293
00:29:42,348 --> 00:29:45,349
No, it was, it
was dark and messy

294
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:48,485
and covered in posters.

295
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:54,224
Because this, this looks
like pre-tween Claire

296
00:29:54,226 --> 00:29:58,862
is frozen in carbonite
and it's a little creepy.

297
00:29:58,864 --> 00:30:01,398
I think this stuff
must have been in boxes

298
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,967
years before I even moved out.

299
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:08,739
Mr. snuffles, here,

300
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:13,577
is where I used to hide
my weed in junior high.

301
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:22,352
It's totally creepy.

302
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,289
Hey, I made some tea.

303
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:32,129
Do you want some?

304
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:46,276
Chamomile, lots of honey.
Thank you.

305
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:53,550
I'm sorry you're having
such a rough time with this.

306
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:56,820
I'm sorry, I didn't know
that this would put me,

307
00:30:56,822 --> 00:30:59,656
us, through the
ringer like this.

308
00:30:59,658 --> 00:31:00,924
I know, baby.

309
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:06,530
I know you know, and
I love you for that.

310
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:09,099
And I love you.

311
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:13,503
I just want you to be
happy, whatever that is.

312
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:14,571
Thank you.

313
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:22,012
Have you thought about
medications, going back on them?

314
00:31:22,014 --> 00:31:23,313
Aaron.

315
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:25,148
I'm just saying that Dr. brown

316
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,117
is way better than
that old quack.

317
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:29,019
He's young and hip and...
really?

318
00:31:29,021 --> 00:31:31,121
No, no, he's no Elvis,

319
00:31:31,123 --> 00:31:33,357
but he's up to speed on
all the newest options

320
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:36,760
and it's just, it's
worth thinking about.

321
00:31:36,762 --> 00:31:40,564
I don't want to be a zombie
again, Aaron, that was awful.

322
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:43,967
I know it was rough,
but it can be better.

323
00:31:43,969 --> 00:31:46,570
We can do it together.

324
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:48,805
Just think about it, okay?

325
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:53,010
- And talk to him.
- Okay, I will.

326
00:31:54,313 --> 00:31:56,346
You were listless
and you didn't bathe

327
00:31:56,348 --> 00:31:58,115
and you didn't laugh at my jokes

328
00:31:58,117 --> 00:31:59,917
and you ate the
neighbor's brains which...

329
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:00,919
hey!

330
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:05,489
Now, I'm going to take a shower

331
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:10,394
so I don't smell
like the undead.

332
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:18,168
You're not just some
stinky zombie, honey.

333
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:20,237
You're my stinky zombie.

334
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:37,774
Hey.

335
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:41,111
Hey, hey, hey.

336
00:34:41,113 --> 00:34:43,513
- You have a nightmare?
- Yeah.

337
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:48,785
I got you, kitten, I got you.

338
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,856
No boogeymen tonight.

339
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:55,592
And tomorrow,

340
00:34:57,161 --> 00:35:00,464
the Mason family steps
onto the gravy train.

341
00:35:00,466 --> 00:35:04,301
It's good dreams
for everybody, okay?

342
00:35:04,303 --> 00:35:05,303
Okay.

343
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:39,522
Bethany?

344
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,671
Claire, you hear that?

345
00:37:57,708 --> 00:37:58,908
Claire?

346
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:06,816
Claire, Claire!

347
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,287
Claire!

348
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:12,255
Oh, oh, no.

349
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:15,659
No, no, no, no, no.

350
00:38:15,661 --> 00:38:19,296
No, no, Claire, Claire,
can you hear me, Claire?

351
00:38:19,298 --> 00:38:21,164
Claire, can you hear me?

352
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:23,466
Uh, sweetie, I need
you to stay awake.

353
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:26,469
Okay, honey, stay awake for me.

354
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,872
And I need you to stay awake

355
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:32,809
and I need you to
tell me your name.

356
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:35,145
Claire, Claire Mason.

357
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:37,314
Yes, that's right, baby.

358
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:38,815
That's very good, very good,

359
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,784
and don't fall asleep.

360
00:38:40,786 --> 00:38:45,021
Okay, so, can you tell
me what year it is?

361
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:46,222
What?

362
00:38:46,224 --> 00:38:49,192
What year is it,
baby, you stay awake.

363
00:38:49,194 --> 00:38:50,794
2016.

364
00:38:50,796 --> 00:38:53,997
That's great, that's
great, sweetie pie.

365
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:56,433
You're doing really
well, don't fall asleep.

366
00:38:56,435 --> 00:38:58,968
- Just tell me my name.
- Bethany.

367
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:01,271
Claire, Claire, stay awake.

368
00:39:01,273 --> 00:39:03,006
They're on their way.

369
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:07,143
Claire, Claire, honey, Claire,
baby, please stay awake.

370
00:39:07,145 --> 00:39:09,479
Stay awake, Claire, Claire.

371
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:53,490
Claire.

372
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:04,334
Claire, come here, baby.

373
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:08,438
Come here, it's okay.

374
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:23,653
Mommy needs a hug, come here.

375
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:26,856
I'm sorry.

376
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,893
Oh, you're so pretty.

377
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:39,169
You're so pretty.

378
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,175
You have so much ahead of you.

379
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:50,280
I used to look like you.

380
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:58,254
You're mom's pretty little
one, now, you know that.

381
00:40:58,256 --> 00:40:59,256
Do you?

382
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:02,725
You're all I have.

383
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:09,165
Beauty is just so brief.

384
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,570
It's goes so fast.

385
00:41:13,572 --> 00:41:15,872
Mommy, you're hurting me.

386
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,942
- Mommy!
- How dare you!

387
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:22,912
- Let go of me!
- Give me that, give it!

388
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:25,114
It's time you grew up!

389
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:09,192
- Aaron.
- I'm here, Claire.

390
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:11,494
How was she in the house?

391
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,531
It was a dream, Claire.

392
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:16,733
What happened?

393
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,337
I was hoping you could tell me.

394
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:25,174
The noise, it moved,

395
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:30,313
she moved further,
further than before,

396
00:42:30,315 --> 00:42:33,516
and I followed her
to the stairs and,

397
00:42:33,518 --> 00:42:35,952
and then she pushed me.

398
00:42:35,954 --> 00:42:39,656
The wall, a hand came from the
wall, and it pushed me down.

399
00:42:39,658 --> 00:42:43,493
It sounds like a great entry

400
00:42:43,495 --> 00:42:45,762
into your dream journal, Claire,

401
00:42:45,764 --> 00:42:47,630
but I want to know the truth.

402
00:42:47,632 --> 00:42:50,600
That is the truth.

403
00:42:50,602 --> 00:42:51,901
Did you know?

404
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:55,371
- What, know?
- Did you know?

405
00:42:55,373 --> 00:42:57,840
- Did I...
- Because I do, now.

406
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:04,280
Er protocol, they, they
checked you for drugs,

407
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:10,853
hallucinogens, they wouldn't
even let me come close to you

408
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:16,225
until Dr. brown talked
to the duty nurse,

409
00:43:16,227 --> 00:43:17,961
explained your past.

410
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:23,399
And then the rabbit died.

411
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,768
Rabbit, what?

412
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:31,975
You're pregnant, Claire.

413
00:43:36,748 --> 00:43:37,814
It's a fact.

414
00:43:38,716 --> 00:43:41,017
It's six weeks of fact.

415
00:43:43,254 --> 00:43:47,156
Now, what I need to know,
what I have to know,

416
00:43:48,058 --> 00:43:50,059
is did you know?

417
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:54,230
Did you know and go down
those stairs on purpose?

418
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:56,799
What?

419
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:59,602
Why would I ever...
I don't know.

420
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:02,572
Exactly, I don't know.

421
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:04,674
No!

422
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:06,609
Aaron, no!

423
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:09,345
No, I would never.

424
00:44:10,347 --> 00:44:12,248
Oh, my god, Aaron, no.

425
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:16,319
I didn't know.

426
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:18,855
I'm sorry.

427
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:23,226
Is it okay?

428
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:27,563
Is the baby okay?

429
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:33,136
Our baby is fine.

430
00:44:41,613 --> 00:44:42,613
We're fine.

431
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:48,451
- We're going to have a baby.
- We're going to have a baby.

432
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:59,228
We're going to have a baby!

433
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:20,950
I will be right downstairs.

434
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,722
Call me if you need anything.

435
00:45:25,724 --> 00:45:27,123
- I will.
- Okay.

436
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:31,060
- Thank you.
- No problem.

437
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:34,797
Let's get you in bed.

438
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:47,710
I love you, Aaron.

439
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:52,648
I love you too, sweetheart.

440
00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:29,118
Okay, I'm fine.

441
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:32,088
I'm okay.

442
00:48:35,747 --> 00:48:37,813
Claire, are you okay?

443
00:48:37,815 --> 00:48:39,715
- Uh, yeah.
- Claire?

444
00:48:42,153 --> 00:48:43,653
You sure you're all right?

445
00:48:43,655 --> 00:48:45,655
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

446
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:52,561
- Can I get in there?
- Just a minute.

447
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:02,772
- Hey.
- What did you need to do?

448
00:49:02,774 --> 00:49:03,774
Uh, why?

449
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:07,209
Were you going to take a shower?

450
00:49:07,211 --> 00:49:08,211
No.

451
00:49:09,913 --> 00:49:12,848
Do I smell, or...
oh, no, it's just,

452
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:16,452
you know, these
old water heaters.

453
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:17,520
Oh, right.

454
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:19,922
- Yeah.
- Okay.

455
00:49:22,025 --> 00:49:23,025
Hey.

456
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:26,829
I love you, Claire bear.

457
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,201
I love all of you.

458
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:39,475
I love you, too.

459
00:49:58,695 --> 00:50:01,297
I will bring you luddites
kicking and screaming

460
00:50:01,299 --> 00:50:02,598
into the modern age.

461
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,467
Hey, not till after
dinner, sith lord.

462
00:50:04,469 --> 00:50:06,802
Yes, ma'am, I promise.

463
00:50:06,804 --> 00:50:07,804
Promise.

464
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,040
Wrong franchise,
but I'll take it.

465
00:50:11,042 --> 00:50:13,676
Oh.

466
00:50:13,678 --> 00:50:15,745
Well, you really didn't have

467
00:50:15,747 --> 00:50:17,246
to go through all this trouble.

468
00:50:17,248 --> 00:50:19,015
I didn't want to put you out.

469
00:50:19,017 --> 00:50:21,617
Oh, no, I mean, you're
practically family.

470
00:50:21,619 --> 00:50:24,220
I mean, the only
family we can stand.

471
00:50:24,222 --> 00:50:25,888
I thought I should follow up,

472
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:29,792
see how you guys were
doing after what happened.

473
00:50:29,794 --> 00:50:32,461
See how she was doing.

474
00:50:32,463 --> 00:50:35,765
It's much appreciated,
really, above and beyond, sir.

475
00:50:35,767 --> 00:50:39,702
You know, secretly, the
drive is like a mini-vacation.

476
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:41,937
I tell Janice that
the phone's dead

477
00:50:41,939 --> 00:50:44,507
then I use it as a
chance to catch up

478
00:50:44,509 --> 00:50:46,642
on all my trashy books on tape.

479
00:50:46,644 --> 00:50:49,245
To life's little luxuries.

480
00:50:49,247 --> 00:50:51,580
Cheers.

481
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:01,757
Oh, I miss Canada sometimes.

482
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:04,126
The little things, Caesar's...

483
00:51:04,128 --> 00:51:06,529
Caesar's, is that
the pizza chain or...

484
00:51:06,531 --> 00:51:08,898
no, Caesar's, it's a bloody Mary

485
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:12,568
with clam juice and booze.
Clam juice and booze?

486
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:14,136
That sounds disgusting.

487
00:51:14,138 --> 00:51:15,838
- But it's good.
- Really?

488
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,440
Do they have, like,
sardines and beer?

489
00:51:17,442 --> 00:51:19,308
Yeah, somebody should do that,

490
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:20,709
or octopus and whiskey.

491
00:51:20,711 --> 00:51:21,644
Yeah.

492
00:51:21,646 --> 00:51:22,812
It's the little things, right?

493
00:51:22,814 --> 00:51:24,780
It's the little things,
like the up-speak,

494
00:51:24,782 --> 00:51:26,949
how we end every sentence
with a question mark.

495
00:51:26,951 --> 00:51:28,951
We sound like a bunch of elves.

496
00:51:30,455 --> 00:51:32,855
It's just not cool, not sexy.

497
00:51:32,857 --> 00:51:34,557
It's the worst with the ladies.

498
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,358
Oh, that's not true.

499
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:39,095
Well, of all the
commonwealth countries,

500
00:51:39,097 --> 00:51:42,498
our accent, Irish,
Australian, Canadian,

501
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:47,002
we sound like a bunch
of apologetic hobbits.

502
00:51:47,004 --> 00:51:48,504
It's not that bad.

503
00:51:48,506 --> 00:51:51,574
Actually, it's our super power.

504
00:51:51,576 --> 00:51:54,510
We hide behind politeness.

505
00:51:54,512 --> 00:51:56,545
It's the ultimate subterfuge,

506
00:51:56,547 --> 00:51:58,481
when everybody
thinks they're safe

507
00:51:58,483 --> 00:52:00,416
and we come charging
in on a moose,

508
00:52:00,418 --> 00:52:03,586
swinging a hockey stick and
screaming beer, it's true.

509
00:52:03,588 --> 00:52:06,322
Yep, I am one of
the chosen, Mr. brown.

510
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,525
That's doc brown to you.

511
00:52:09,527 --> 00:52:11,694
Only if you've got
a flux capacitor, eh?

512
00:52:11,696 --> 00:52:12,761
I just might.

513
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:29,512
Aaron?

514
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:33,349
Don't just sit there, help him!

515
00:52:36,053 --> 00:52:37,053
Aaron!

516
00:52:48,699 --> 00:52:49,832
Yeah, baby?

517
00:52:59,442 --> 00:53:02,111
Uh, nothing.

518
00:53:02,113 --> 00:53:05,281
Just the knife was
a little slippery.

519
00:53:06,483 --> 00:53:08,684
Okay, but you called my name.

520
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:11,587
Yeah, uh, dinner's almost ready.

521
00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:14,890
Okay, thanks, sweetie.

522
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:23,766
So, onto other, more
pressing matters.

523
00:53:23,768 --> 00:53:26,635
There is no way, I have to
give you push back on this,

524
00:53:26,637 --> 00:53:28,737
but there is no way
that a tralfamadorian

525
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:30,039
would be friends with an ewok,

526
00:53:30,041 --> 00:53:31,440
it's not even the same universe.

527
00:53:31,442 --> 00:53:33,342
Clearly you don't
understand the complexities

528
00:53:33,344 --> 00:53:37,580
of slaughterhouse five, or
the politics of the ewok.

529
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:16,051
- A mare, is it inherited...
- Help me, help me!

530
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:18,654
Claire!

531
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:22,224
Claire, Claire, what, oh, no.

532
00:54:22,226 --> 00:54:24,193
No, no, what did you do, baby?

533
00:54:24,195 --> 00:54:25,628
What did you do?

534
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:26,795
I'm going to call an ambulance.

535
00:54:26,797 --> 00:54:28,964
It was Bethany, she grabbed me.

536
00:54:28,966 --> 00:54:32,401
I had to stop her,
cut her fingers off.

537
00:54:34,872 --> 00:54:35,872
Aaron.

538
00:54:37,073 --> 00:54:40,843
Please, no, no, no, no!

539
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:53,622
It's okay, Claire, I'm here.

540
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:56,859
It's okay, Claire,
you're in the hospital.

541
00:54:56,861 --> 00:54:58,594
The baby?

542
00:54:58,596 --> 00:55:01,096
It's fine, the baby is fine.

543
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:06,235
But you're not,
sweetheart, you need rest.

544
00:55:06,237 --> 00:55:08,470
I just woke up.

545
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:11,674
Aaron, why am I handcuffed?

546
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:15,010
It's for your
protection, Claire.

547
00:55:15,012 --> 00:55:16,979
Yours and the child's.

548
00:55:16,981 --> 00:55:20,182
I didn't do
this, I didn't do this.

549
00:55:20,184 --> 00:55:23,085
She, she did this,
she made me do this.

550
00:55:23,087 --> 00:55:26,588
Honey, honey, we were
there, we saw what happened.

551
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:28,724
You didn't see,
you didn't see, Aaron,

552
00:55:28,726 --> 00:55:30,693
because she chose
me, she wants me.

553
00:55:30,695 --> 00:55:32,628
Aaron, you just didn't see.
Claire, please just-

554
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:34,463
- no, Aaron,
you have to listen to me,

555
00:55:34,465 --> 00:55:36,065
you have to be on my side, okay,

556
00:55:36,067 --> 00:55:37,366
you can't turn your back on me...

557
00:55:37,368 --> 00:55:39,101
- Listen, I...
- And think that I'm crazy.

558
00:55:39,103 --> 00:55:40,836
I'm not turning my
back on you, sweetheart,

559
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:42,938
but you need to calm down.
No, no.

560
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:46,041
Just rest, Claire, we're
getting you the help you need.

561
00:55:46,043 --> 00:55:47,543
It's good for you.

562
00:55:47,545 --> 00:55:49,478
No, I'm not
a child, I'm not crazy,

563
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,380
I'm not crazy, she did
this, the little girl,

564
00:55:51,382 --> 00:55:54,016
the girl did this, no,
goddammit, Aaron, let me out.

565
00:55:54,018 --> 00:55:56,652
God, what is that, what is that?

566
00:55:56,654 --> 00:56:00,823
It's fine, she's fine,
it's safe, Claire, it's safe.

567
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:08,130
It's safe.
Aaron, I didn't do this.

568
00:56:08,132 --> 00:56:11,500
It was her, she did
this to me, to us,

569
00:56:11,502 --> 00:56:13,502
Bethany, Bethany.

570
00:56:13,504 --> 00:56:16,472
Please, sweetheart,
it's okay, just sleep.

571
00:56:16,474 --> 00:56:18,407
It's going to be all
right, I love you, baby.

572
00:56:18,409 --> 00:56:20,142
- Aaron...
- I love you so much.

573
00:56:20,144 --> 00:56:21,577
I love you so much.

574
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:47,536
Mom?

575
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:52,508
Mommy?

576
00:57:06,689 --> 00:57:08,424
Mommy, are you okay?

577
00:57:15,166 --> 00:57:16,166
I'm fine.

578
00:57:18,234 --> 00:57:19,234
She bit me.

579
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,371
What?

580
00:57:22,373 --> 00:57:26,675
That ugly, worthless
little animal bit me.

581
00:57:26,677 --> 00:57:27,677
Come here.

582
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,847
I said, come here!

583
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,350
Look at the water.

584
00:57:35,352 --> 00:57:38,487
- No, I don't want to...
- Look at the water!

585
00:57:38,489 --> 00:57:41,857
This is what ugliness
brings, do you understand?

586
00:57:41,859 --> 00:57:43,125
Yes, mother.

587
00:57:43,127 --> 00:57:46,662
This is what happens
when you lose a baby.

588
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:05,781
Claire, Claire, Claire,
no, no, baby, please, please!

589
00:58:05,783 --> 00:58:08,784
Please wake up, please
wake up, please!

590
00:58:08,786 --> 00:58:10,519
Please, baby, don't!

591
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:13,689
No!

592
00:58:15,024 --> 00:58:18,861
Claire, Claire, wake up,
wake up, Claire, Claire!

593
00:58:21,532 --> 00:58:22,865
Aaron, Aaron.

594
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,669
Come on, let's go home.

595
00:58:29,138 --> 00:58:32,307
There's nothing you
can do here now.

596
00:58:32,309 --> 00:58:34,476
She's going to be
asleep for hours.

597
00:58:34,478 --> 00:58:36,044
Let's go, come on.

598
00:58:36,813 --> 00:58:38,447
There's a cab out front.

599
00:58:38,449 --> 00:58:40,649
I'll come pick you
up in the morning.

600
00:58:40,651 --> 00:58:43,619
- You sure?
- Yeah, come on.

601
00:58:43,621 --> 00:58:45,854
- Okay.
- Go home, go home.

602
00:58:49,726 --> 00:58:53,228
Get some sleep.

603
00:58:56,799 --> 00:59:00,102
Thank you, uh, if
you weren't there,

604
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:03,539
I mean, that was...
- hey.

605
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:06,375
I don't know what
I would have done,

606
00:59:06,377 --> 00:59:09,878
Paul, it was just...
I was happy to help.

607
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:13,315
Just get home, get
some rest, okay?

608
00:59:13,317 --> 00:59:14,583
Yeah.

609
00:59:14,585 --> 00:59:17,152
- It's been a long night.
- Yeah.

610
00:59:17,154 --> 00:59:21,023
Uh, thank you for everything.
I'm going on break.

611
00:59:21,025 --> 00:59:22,591
Eight o'clock?

612
00:59:22,593 --> 00:59:24,026
See you then.

613
00:59:24,028 --> 00:59:25,594
Okay.

614
00:59:25,596 --> 00:59:27,596
- She's going to be okay.
- Yeah.

615
00:59:27,598 --> 00:59:29,264
- I'll be here.
- Okay.

616
00:59:29,266 --> 00:59:31,667
- Just relax.
- Thanks, Paul.

617
00:59:42,712 --> 00:59:44,780
Right this way, ma'am.

618
00:59:46,549 --> 00:59:47,683
Late night?

619
00:59:48,484 --> 00:59:49,885
Early morning.

620
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:52,654
How's your patient?

621
00:59:52,656 --> 00:59:54,056
Good, for now.

622
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:57,960
Kind of an odd one,
to be honest with you.

623
00:59:57,962 --> 00:59:59,728
Well, let me know
if you need some help.

624
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:01,496
You are a godsend.

625
01:00:01,498 --> 01:00:04,800
Hey, can I hop on this computer
and check some records?

626
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:49,511
Come on.

627
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:46,635
- Miss Aaron...
- Oh, fuck.

628
01:01:46,637 --> 01:01:49,037
Miss Aaron.

629
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:46,254
Let's take a look, shall we?

630
01:03:46,256 --> 01:03:47,589
I just...

631
01:03:47,591 --> 01:03:50,392
I'm your doctor, dear.

632
01:03:50,394 --> 01:03:53,228
Now let's behave properly.

633
01:03:53,230 --> 01:03:56,765
No need for theatrics
or impudence.

634
01:03:56,767 --> 01:03:58,433
Get away from me.

635
01:03:58,435 --> 01:04:00,101
Oh, don't be shy.

636
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:06,975
We both know that you
wouldn't be in a family way

637
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:10,078
if you were.

638
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:12,347
- What?
- Shy, that is.

639
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:15,383
Get away from me or I'll scream.

640
01:04:15,385 --> 01:04:16,751
Come, come.

641
01:04:16,753 --> 01:04:18,753
The checkup is routine.

642
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,990
We've been down
this road before.

643
01:04:21,992 --> 01:04:26,228
You don't want to raise
up any old ghosts, do you,

644
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:30,832
Mrs. pinnacle?

645
01:04:31,934 --> 01:04:35,203
That's my name, how
do you know my name?

646
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:37,939
My apologies.

647
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:41,743
He's barely cold
by now, isn't he?

648
01:04:42,678 --> 01:04:45,547
What's important are the girls

649
01:04:45,549 --> 01:04:49,784
and you, Susan, you and
your previous little girls.

650
01:04:51,821 --> 01:04:54,823
Mommy's got to be
in tip-top shape.

651
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:58,793
Mommy can't be the apple queen

652
01:04:59,996 --> 01:05:04,232
if she's not in tip-top
shape, now, can she?

653
01:05:04,234 --> 01:05:06,534
Mommy.

654
01:05:06,536 --> 01:05:10,138
I'm not a mother,
I don't have a child.

655
01:05:14,877 --> 01:05:18,880
Silly lies don't suit
your apple pretty lips.

656
01:05:19,949 --> 01:05:22,717
We were both there,
all of us were.

657
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:25,220
Them that was and is not now.

658
01:05:28,024 --> 01:05:29,491
Two little girls,

659
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:34,829
beautiful and pure
on the inside,

660
01:05:34,831 --> 01:05:37,465
one to Cherish, one to nourish,

661
01:05:39,535 --> 01:05:44,039
a blessing and a curse.
Please, I'm not her,

662
01:05:44,041 --> 01:05:46,608
I'm not my mother. Yes, you are!

663
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:50,412
To both of them!

664
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:55,884
God doesn't give us

665
01:05:55,886 --> 01:05:57,185
what we desire.

666
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:00,789
God gives us what we need.

667
01:06:15,404 --> 01:06:18,139
- Oh, babe.
- She's so beautiful.

668
01:06:19,241 --> 01:06:22,911
Oh, my god, my little
Claire, you are perfect.

669
01:06:22,913 --> 01:06:24,479
She's beautiful.

670
01:06:27,783 --> 01:06:31,720
Doctor, I think you need
to take a look at this.

671
01:06:31,722 --> 01:06:34,122
I understand, nurse, thank you.

672
01:06:34,124 --> 01:06:35,657
Let me see her.

673
01:06:35,659 --> 01:06:39,227
Two tiny miracles, we
are so blessed, honey.

674
01:06:39,229 --> 01:06:42,630
- I want to hold her.
- Of course.

675
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:48,236
We did all we could.

676
01:06:49,305 --> 01:06:52,307
I'm sorry.

677
01:06:53,142 --> 01:06:55,110
I don't deserve this.

678
01:06:57,113 --> 01:06:59,581
I don't deserve this!

679
01:06:59,583 --> 01:07:03,451
What did you do to me,
what did you do to me?

680
01:07:05,155 --> 01:07:08,390
- What did you do?
- Susan, Susan.

681
01:07:08,392 --> 01:07:09,991
Oh, my god.

682
01:07:09,993 --> 01:07:12,160
The girls need you now,
they need their mother.

683
01:07:12,162 --> 01:07:13,728
Listen to me... what did you do?

684
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:15,063
It'll be all right, I promise.

685
01:07:15,065 --> 01:07:16,698
Look at me, Susan, I promise.

686
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:19,667
What did you
do, what did you do?

687
01:07:19,669 --> 01:07:21,102
What did you do?

688
01:07:21,104 --> 01:07:23,738
What did you do,
what did you do?

689
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:25,974
What did you do,
what did you do!

690
01:07:25,976 --> 01:07:28,043
Enough, I said enough!

691
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:31,513
Got you.

692
01:07:31,515 --> 01:07:33,081
Come on.

693
01:07:33,083 --> 01:07:35,650
Stop. Miss Mason, are you okay?

694
01:07:35,652 --> 01:07:37,252
Yeah.

695
01:07:37,254 --> 01:07:39,220
Are you sure you're all right?

696
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:41,222
Did he touch you?

697
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:43,625
Yes, or no, no, he didn't.

698
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:46,694
No, no, he didn't.

699
01:07:46,696 --> 01:07:48,563
Get Mr. merman back to his room.

700
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:51,232
This time, follow the
procedures precisely.

701
01:07:51,234 --> 01:07:53,134
Yes, sir, come on, Mr. merman.

702
01:07:53,136 --> 01:07:55,203
Doctor merman to
you, you young...

703
01:07:55,205 --> 01:07:57,105
yeah, just move your ass.

704
01:07:57,107 --> 01:07:58,940
He's a doctor here?

705
01:07:58,942 --> 01:08:00,942
No, he used to be, 15 years ago,

706
01:08:00,944 --> 01:08:03,678
that was before the
pills and the mills.

707
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:06,347
He said he knows me,
he knows my mother.

708
01:08:06,349 --> 01:08:08,249
He said he knows me.

709
01:08:08,251 --> 01:08:10,518
Miss Mason, you seem
a little fuzzy still.

710
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,554
Do you remember anything
about how you got down here?

711
01:08:12,556 --> 01:08:15,356
Listen to me, he
knew my mother's name.

712
01:08:15,358 --> 01:08:18,493
He knew about me, he
said I have a sister.

713
01:08:18,495 --> 01:08:21,096
Yeah, well, he also
wants to do a prostate exam

714
01:08:21,098 --> 01:08:22,630
on me every Wednesday.

715
01:08:22,632 --> 01:08:24,666
He knew our names,
he knew mother's name.

716
01:08:24,668 --> 01:08:26,468
The apple queen, he was there,

717
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:28,670
he saw all of us...
let's take a walk,

718
01:08:28,672 --> 01:08:31,306
and you can tell me all
about the apple queen, okay?

719
01:08:31,308 --> 01:08:34,042
Well, you need to let
my husband in right away.

720
01:08:34,044 --> 01:08:35,610
- We'll do that...
- Just tell him.

721
01:08:35,612 --> 01:08:37,412
But right now, you're
going to get some rest.

722
01:08:37,414 --> 01:08:38,913
Okay.

723
01:08:38,915 --> 01:08:40,515
Because everything is
going to be so much better

724
01:08:40,517 --> 01:08:43,985
once you rest.

725
01:08:47,723 --> 01:08:50,625
Hey, Paul, I was just about
to head to the hospital.

726
01:08:50,627 --> 01:08:52,961
We need to talk,
can I come inside?

727
01:08:52,963 --> 01:08:56,498
Yeah, yeah, uh, is everything
okay, is Claire okay?

728
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:57,732
She will be.

729
01:09:02,371 --> 01:09:05,273
What are these?

730
01:09:05,275 --> 01:09:07,275
Claire's family file.

731
01:09:08,344 --> 01:09:10,445
Is something wrong with Claire?

732
01:09:10,447 --> 01:09:12,046
Yes.

733
01:09:12,048 --> 01:09:15,116
All of Claire's issues must
be stemming form malory.

734
01:09:15,118 --> 01:09:16,118
Malory?

735
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:19,487
Is that a mental illness or...

736
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:21,789
- Her twin sister.
- What?

737
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:23,825
Claire had a twin sister.

738
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:27,795
No, she's never said
anything about a sister.

739
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:31,533
She didn't know,
nobody told her.

740
01:09:31,535 --> 01:09:35,403
Claire's childhood was hidden
from her, from everyone.

741
01:09:35,405 --> 01:09:38,206
Her mother truly must
have been a monster.

742
01:09:38,208 --> 01:09:39,841
Look, look at this.

743
01:09:39,843 --> 01:09:40,843
Here.

744
01:09:41,877 --> 01:09:44,112
The baby was born
horribly deformed,

745
01:09:44,114 --> 01:09:46,314
and her mother was so ashamed,

746
01:09:46,316 --> 01:09:49,417
she bribed the doctor to
falsify the birth records

747
01:09:49,419 --> 01:09:51,452
to show that her
twin was stillborn

748
01:09:51,454 --> 01:09:53,955
even though the baby
was still alive.

749
01:09:53,957 --> 01:09:57,091
That explains the
genetic aberration.

750
01:09:57,093 --> 01:09:59,827
That's why your baby
was born stillborn.

751
01:09:59,829 --> 01:10:02,030
It was inherited
from the mother,

752
01:10:02,032 --> 01:10:03,097
from Claire.

753
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:08,570
So,

754
01:10:11,006 --> 01:10:12,574
what does it mean?

755
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:19,814
- Claire's imaginary friend.
- Yeah, uh, Bethany.

756
01:10:19,816 --> 01:10:22,650
Malory Bethany pinnacle.

757
01:10:22,652 --> 01:10:26,254
Wait, you're saying that
Bethany is Claire's sister?

758
01:10:26,256 --> 01:10:28,089
Her sister, precisely.

759
01:10:28,091 --> 01:10:32,527
Um, okay, Paul, but
you're not suggesting

760
01:10:32,529 --> 01:10:36,531
something supernatural,
this is...

761
01:10:36,533 --> 01:10:38,566
Look, I'm a man of science,

762
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:42,270
but this house is doing
horrible things to her psyche

763
01:10:42,272 --> 01:10:44,872
and I suggest you
don't bring her back.

764
01:11:31,988 --> 01:11:33,955
Put your clothes on and get
dressed, please, right now.

765
01:11:33,957 --> 01:11:35,690
We have to leave, we have to go.

766
01:11:35,692 --> 01:11:36,791
What's going on?

767
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:38,526
I saw her, Bethany, malory,

768
01:11:38,528 --> 01:11:40,295
whatever her name is, I
saw her and she fooled me.

769
01:11:40,297 --> 01:11:41,529
- Where?
- She fooled me,

770
01:11:41,531 --> 01:11:42,664
just the same way
she fooled you.

771
01:11:42,666 --> 01:11:44,766
Dr. brown, she made me cut him.

772
01:11:44,768 --> 01:11:47,769
- My god.
- On his throat, and he bled,

773
01:11:47,771 --> 01:11:50,104
and he died, are you
going to help me,

774
01:11:50,106 --> 01:11:51,773
who's going to believe me?

775
01:11:51,775 --> 01:11:53,241
I don't want to go to jail.

776
01:11:53,243 --> 01:11:55,443
No one believed you
and I'm your husband,

777
01:11:55,445 --> 01:11:56,711
I didn't believe you.

778
01:11:56,713 --> 01:11:57,945
No, no, no, okay?

779
01:11:57,947 --> 01:11:59,847
I need to lay her to rest.

780
01:11:59,849 --> 01:12:01,049
What?

781
01:12:01,051 --> 01:12:02,817
She was my sister and
I will not treat her

782
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:06,154
the way my mother did, I
will not become my mother.

783
01:12:06,156 --> 01:12:08,923
We need to do this to move on.
No, no.

784
01:12:08,925 --> 01:12:11,993
You don't have
to come with me but

785
01:12:13,062 --> 01:12:16,230
I'm going back.
I don't want to go.

786
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:36,417
- Are you sure?
- Not at all.

787
01:12:43,125 --> 01:12:44,192
I'm sorry.

788
01:12:46,261 --> 01:12:48,896
I'm so sorry, I didn't want it.

789
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:52,734
She made, she made me.

790
01:13:00,976 --> 01:13:01,976
I'm sorry.

791
01:13:34,109 --> 01:13:35,109
All right.

792
01:13:52,728 --> 01:13:53,728
There.

793
01:13:55,631 --> 01:13:56,697
That was it.

794
01:13:57,499 --> 01:13:59,400
That was my place.

795
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:25,426
There's a hole in
here, like a tunnel.

796
01:14:25,428 --> 01:14:28,396
Can you make this hole larger?

797
01:14:28,398 --> 01:14:29,797
Yeah, hold on.

798
01:15:06,535 --> 01:15:07,535
Okay.

799
01:15:08,604 --> 01:15:10,638
Okay, that should be big enough.

800
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:12,507
I'm going to, I'm
going to get inside.

801
01:15:12,509 --> 01:15:15,510
- No, no, I have to.
- Claire, it's not safe.

802
01:15:15,512 --> 01:15:17,144
No, Aaron.

803
01:15:17,146 --> 01:15:18,146
I need to.

804
01:15:19,114 --> 01:15:20,515
She's my sister.

805
01:15:33,996 --> 01:15:34,996
Be safe.

806
01:15:53,282 --> 01:15:55,349
Where does it go?

807
01:15:55,351 --> 01:15:57,985
I don't know, it keeps going.

808
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,593
No, honey, I don't like this,

809
01:16:05,595 --> 01:16:07,361
I don't like this, come back.

810
01:16:07,363 --> 01:16:09,030
Aaron, it's okay.

811
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:13,367
Follow my knocking.

812
01:16:38,294 --> 01:16:40,461
I'm right here, Claire.

813
01:16:52,008 --> 01:16:53,608
Again?

814
01:16:53,610 --> 01:16:56,510
Got it.

815
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:20,701
Aaron, I see a tunnel.

816
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:24,805
I'm going to go down.

817
01:17:24,807 --> 01:17:25,973
Be careful.

818
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:38,480
Bethany.

819
01:18:43,453 --> 01:18:45,953
Bethany, I'm your sister!

820
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:53,294
It's okay, it's okay.

821
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:55,930
Stop it!

822
01:18:57,432 --> 01:19:00,701
Stop it, Bethany,
I'm here to help you.

823
01:19:15,351 --> 01:19:18,285
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay!

824
01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:23,491
Listen, I'm here.

825
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:26,694
Stop it, stop it, I'm here.

826
01:19:26,696 --> 01:19:29,930
Bethany, I'm here,
I'm here, I'm here.

827
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:38,672
You're okay.

828
01:19:41,243 --> 01:19:42,409
I'm here now.

829
01:19:43,979 --> 01:19:45,546
I'm here, Bethany.

830
01:19:47,215 --> 01:19:48,282
You're okay.

831
01:19:51,052 --> 01:19:52,119
You're safe.

832
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:42,289
It was my fault.

833
01:22:43,191 --> 01:22:45,326
It was my fault you died.

834
01:22:48,897 --> 01:22:50,064
We went away.

835
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,934
I was 10 years old and I,

836
01:22:55,704 --> 01:22:58,105
I begged mom to take me skiing,

837
01:22:58,107 --> 01:22:59,673
it was a snow day.

838
01:23:01,042 --> 01:23:04,611
Eight days in a cabin
with food and warmth

839
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:10,217
and friends,

840
01:23:11,586 --> 01:23:15,055
while you starved here
alone in the dark.

841
01:23:23,531 --> 01:23:24,765
It's my fault.

842
01:23:27,702 --> 01:23:31,171
I understand why you
hated me, I hate me.

843
01:23:33,775 --> 01:23:35,743
I was your only friend,

844
01:23:37,078 --> 01:23:39,813
but I didn't know you were real.

845
01:23:43,985 --> 01:23:45,152
I'm so sorry.

846
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:55,763
It's time to set you free.

847
01:24:28,630 --> 01:24:30,564
Honestly, I still think you guys

848
01:24:30,566 --> 01:24:32,399
could have gotten
a higher number,

849
01:24:32,401 --> 01:24:35,102
but as long as you're happy.

850
01:24:41,543 --> 01:24:43,777
We are, very, thank you.

851
01:24:50,852 --> 01:24:54,221
Okay, then, well, if you've
taken everything you need

852
01:24:54,223 --> 01:24:56,156
and you've tied up
all your loose ends...

853
01:24:56,158 --> 01:24:57,558
yep, all done.

854
01:25:08,903 --> 01:25:10,938
It's been a real
pleasure, folks.

855
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:13,273
- You, as well.
- Thank you.

856
01:25:37,765 --> 01:25:39,233
Are you hungry?

857
01:25:40,768 --> 01:25:42,469
Not really.

858
01:25:42,471 --> 01:25:44,338
I just want to get out of here.

859
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:45,739
Yeah.

860
01:25:45,741 --> 01:25:48,475
We can get something on the way.

861
01:25:49,811 --> 01:25:53,614
Here's to new beginnings.
To new beginnings.
