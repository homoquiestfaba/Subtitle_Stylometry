00:01:19,591 --> 00:01:22,343
Oh, mans. It's glorious!

3
00:01:22,427 --> 00:01:24,971
Watching TV will never be the same.

4
00:01:25,055 --> 00:01:28,433
Can you believe someone was just
throwing this beauty away?

5
00:01:28,516 --> 00:01:30,977
I mean this baby's got it all!

6
00:01:31,394 --> 00:01:33,813
That pristine wood foam laminate.

7
00:01:33,897 --> 00:01:36,983
Brackets for CDs, DVDs, cassettes,

8
00:01:37,067 --> 00:01:39,194
all kinds of obsolete physical media.

9
00:01:40,236 --> 00:01:42,405
A family of marmots
living in a stereo drawer.

[marmots squeaking]

00:01:43,406 --> 00:01:46,868

[Robin grunts]

00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:54,250
Ain't no thang.

15
00:01:54,334 --> 00:01:56,336
We just got to find something
to wedge under its.

16
00:01:57,754 --> 00:02:00,006
Hmm. Hmm.

17
00:02:06,304 --> 00:02:08,098
Think harder, genius.

18
00:02:13,812 --> 00:02:15,480
Yo, this little squidgy will do.

19
00:02:17,857 --> 00:02:20,068
Nice work! Now to see what's on.

00:02:20,151 --> 00:02:22,737
-[remote clicks]
-Hello, Titans!

21
00:02:22,821 --> 00:02:24,072
Control Freak?

22
00:02:24,155 --> 00:02:26,449
What madness
do you have in store this time?

23
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:28,326
You gonna turn us into claymation?

24
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,703
Make us hawk food processors

25
00:02:29,786 --> 00:02:32,038
in some tacky three-camera infomercial?

26
00:02:32,122 --> 00:02:33,998
Twist us into
a gritty live-action series

27
00:02:34,082 --> 00:02:35,792
targeted at adult audiences?

28
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:38,920
That's been done. So gritty.

29
00:02:39,003 --> 00:02:42,549
Oh, weren't you clods paying attention
to the opening credits?

30
00:02:42,632 --> 00:02:44,676
In our defense, we were getting
this thing up the stairs.

31
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,970
This is your...

00:02:47,053 --> 00:02:50,098

34
00:02:52,058 --> 00:02:54,018
You mean like another movie?

35
00:02:54,102 --> 00:02:55,603
Uh, did I say, movie?

36
00:02:55,687 --> 00:02:59,023
[groans] Not a crossover.
That's when a lame show

37
00:02:59,107 --> 00:03:02,527
tries to glom onto a cooler one in order
to boost their popularity.

38
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:06,740
-Oh, no! Are we's being canceled?
-One can only hope.

39
00:03:07,365 --> 00:03:09,325
Everyone knows a good crossover
has to have

40
00:03:09,409 --> 00:03:12,037
some epic threat that brings the heroes
from two worlds together.

41
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,789
And epic threats just aren't our thing.

42
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,002
Who said this was
a good crossover, huh?

43
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,422
[gulps] He means business, Titans.

44
00:03:22,505 --> 00:03:24,090
We'd better play along. [grunts]

45
00:03:27,218 --> 00:03:29,345
Robin, please, what are you doing?

46
00:03:29,429 --> 00:03:30,930
In superhero crossovers,

47
00:03:31,014 --> 00:03:33,266
each team is introduced
in an action set piece,

48
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:35,810
you know, to remind the audience
how awesome the heroes are

49
00:03:35,894 --> 00:03:37,771
even before they meet
their counterparts.

50
00:03:37,854 --> 00:03:40,607
Quick, everybody, do something action-y,
before they cut away to the other h--

[thrilling music playing]

52
00:03:44,152 --> 00:03:45,987
[Catwoman] The superhero girls?

53
00:03:46,071 --> 00:03:48,823
But our plan for this heist
was purr-fect.

54
00:03:55,205 --> 00:03:56,164
[meows]

55
00:03:56,873 --> 00:03:58,875
Oh, oh, sorry, Mittens.

56
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:01,711
No matter how "purr-fect" your plan is,

57
00:04:01,795 --> 00:04:04,672
our captain is always
gonna have a perfecter one.

58
00:04:04,756 --> 00:04:07,008
I'm flattered. But it is a team effort.

59
00:04:08,218 --> 00:04:09,636

That's my friend, Harleen.

66
00:04:22,857 --> 00:04:25,860
Oh, you care about
your friends now, Babs?

67
00:04:25,944 --> 00:04:27,987
I do, when they're not supervillains.

68
00:04:28,071 --> 00:04:29,989
Oh, don't be so dramatic.

69
00:04:30,073 --> 00:04:31,282
Zee, are you okay?

70
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,076
[growls]

71
00:04:34,869 --> 00:04:36,830
Wha-- Oh, yeah. Totally.

72
00:04:36,996 --> 00:04:37,914
How are you?

73
00:04:41,418 --> 00:04:44,587
One of these days, we're going to crush
you jerks! And...

74
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,880
Wait. What's this?

75
00:04:45,964 --> 00:04:49,300
Ah, who cares what it is.
It's bustin' us free!

76
00:04:49,384 --> 00:04:51,344
So long, clowns!

77
00:04:56,349 --> 00:04:59,227
[scoffs] Let me guess.
Creepy purple cloud got 'em?

78
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,062
Exactly. How did you know?

79
00:05:01,688 --> 00:05:04,566
Same thing happened to me last week
when I took Solomon Grundy down.

80
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:06,317
And when I was pounding on the Riddler.

81
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:08,987
Yesterday, I stopped
both Toyman and Cheetah.

82
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,614
Each time...
[makes whooshing sounds] gone.

83
00:05:14,325 --> 00:05:18,705
Uh... Oh, nothing happened
to the bad guys I caught this week.

84
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,791
Of course, I didn't catch any bad guys,

85
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:25,003
but I did help my neighbor
find his lost cat.

86
00:05:26,421 --> 00:05:28,256
Sounds like we have a mystery to solve.

87
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:32,510
Babs, I think what you meant to say
is, "we" have a mystery to solve.

88
00:05:32,594 --> 00:05:34,429
Boys, there's no need to compete.

89
00:05:34,512 --> 00:05:37,015
-Now! Go!
-[girls laughing]

90
00:05:37,098 --> 00:05:38,683
-[boys grunting]
-We'll let you know

91
00:05:38,767 --> 00:05:40,685
where the bad guys went
after we find 'em!

92
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,106
[Lex Luthor] I know what
you're asking yourselves.

93
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,025
What would a multi-billionaire like me

94
00:05:47,108 --> 00:05:49,444
want with such an eclectic group of...

95
00:05:49,527 --> 00:05:50,987
-you?
-[toilet flushes]

96
00:05:52,155 --> 00:05:54,365
This Hall of Doom
must've cost you a mint.

97
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:57,535
You think you could afford a decent
hand-dryer in the ladies room?

98
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,623
-[squishing sounds]
-Ew, real fur?

99
00:06:01,706 --> 00:06:03,792
-What are you, like, an actual cat?
-[growls softly]

100
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:07,087
-Hey, Selina, eat your heart out.
-[Lex clears throat]

101
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:11,883
What if I told you I hold the power
to get rid of every superhero?

102
00:06:15,011 --> 00:06:17,097
While searching through
the remains of Krypton,

103
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,017
my space probe came across
The Amulet of Cythonna.

104
00:06:21,101 --> 00:06:25,230
This device uses an ancient science
even I have yet to understand.

105
00:06:25,313 --> 00:06:28,608
-But its power is undeniable.
-[Grundy scoffs]

106
00:06:28,691 --> 00:06:31,945
Power? Luthor no find trinket in space.

107
00:06:32,028 --> 00:06:34,906
Luthor find trinket in cereal box.

108
00:06:34,989 --> 00:06:36,741
[villains laugh boisterously]

109
00:06:38,743 --> 00:06:42,747
If it weren't for this, Chuckles,
you'd be in jail now.

110
00:06:42,997 --> 00:06:45,166
But if you are still not convinced...

111
00:06:46,626 --> 00:06:47,919
[grunts]

112
00:06:49,546 --> 00:06:53,383
-Uh, where'd he go?
-They call it the Phantom Zone.

113
00:06:53,466 --> 00:06:57,011
But you can think of it as our own
personal superhero dumping ground.

114
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,515
[screams, grunts]

115
00:07:01,224 --> 00:07:04,477
[growls] If you have that,
why do you need us?

116
00:07:05,103 --> 00:07:08,773
Someone's gotta lure all those heroes
into our little trap.

117
00:07:08,857 --> 00:07:11,693
[Jessica] These are the spots
the mist was seen.

118
00:07:11,776 --> 00:07:13,278
Hmm. I don't see a pattern.

119
00:07:13,361 --> 00:07:15,488
But if you squint just right,
it kind of looks like a puppy.

120
00:07:15,572 --> 00:07:17,532
Come on, Babs. We have to ke--

121
00:07:17,615 --> 00:07:19,909
-Aw...
-Guys, check this out.

122
00:07:20,493 --> 00:07:22,245
See something in your armor-cam video?

123
00:07:22,328 --> 00:07:24,205
Not see, hear.

124
00:07:24,914 --> 00:07:28,334
-Just listen.
-[man] <i>Cythonna.</i>

125
00:07:28,418 --> 00:07:31,087
Uh, is it saying, cellphones?

126
00:07:31,171 --> 00:07:36,134
-Sounds more like "syphon oats."
-She's saying Cythonna.

127
00:07:36,551 --> 00:07:38,636
But that's impossible.

128
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,138
What is Cythonna?

129
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,307
Well, not what. Who.

130
00:07:42,682 --> 00:07:46,436
I mean, even a planet of science dorks
like Krypton had its mythology,

131
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:50,690
and Cythonna was the goddess
of darkness, blight, and suffering.

132
00:07:50,774 --> 00:07:53,109
Yeesh. Bet she was a blast at parties.

133
00:07:53,193 --> 00:07:56,237
Story goes, she ran the show
on Krypton for centuries,

134
00:07:56,321 --> 00:07:59,866
<i>which was pretty much a hot heap</i>
<i>of stink for all concerned,</i>

135
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:03,870
<i>until, one day, her kid brother, Rao,</i>
<i>god of sun and other stuff,</i>

136
00:08:03,953 --> 00:08:07,582
<i>trapped her in an amulet</i>
<i>and chucked her into space.</i>

137
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:10,919
So while kids here are told to wish upon
a shooting star,

138
00:08:11,002 --> 00:08:16,424
we were told to behave, it could be
Cythonna coming to get you.

139
00:08:16,508 --> 00:08:18,468
And did you believe that?

140
00:08:18,551 --> 00:08:20,804
What? No! No. I'm from Krypton.

141
00:08:20,887 --> 00:08:25,558
No one believed in ancient
yet terrifying myths like that.

142
00:08:25,642 --> 00:08:28,228
So, yeah, let's just talk about
something else, all right?

143
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:30,438
Did I hear there's a map
that looks like a puppy?

144
00:08:33,775 --> 00:08:37,153
'Sup nerds? Mind if we play?

Hey, Giganta! You're not gonna
disappear this time.

148
00:08:48,623 --> 00:08:51,543
Oh, we ain't disappearing. You are!

149
00:08:51,876 --> 00:08:53,962
-Huh?
-[both scream]

150
00:08:55,255 --> 00:08:57,424
That's what happens to any superhero

151
00:08:57,507 --> 00:09:00,885
dumb enough to face the Legion of Doom!

Oh, no! [screaming]

Oh, this is terrible!

163
00:09:44,888 --> 00:09:47,807
-Chin up, Garth. We're not done yet.
-No!

-Wait. Garth, are you okay? Talk to me.
-[cellphone beeps]

170
00:10:07,035 --> 00:10:10,914
They've teamed up, and we think they got
Ollie, Hal, and Barry too.

171
00:10:10,997 --> 00:10:14,709
They call themselves the Legacy of Doom!

172
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,753
[Hawkman] <i>It's the Legion of Doom,</i>
<i>Garth.</i>

173
00:10:16,961 --> 00:10:18,088
[Garth] <i>Really?</i>

174
00:10:18,171 --> 00:10:20,006
<i>I could swear Livewire said...</i>

175
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:22,801
Guys, prioritize details. Where are you?

176
00:10:22,884 --> 00:10:24,427
The park! Hurry!

177
00:10:24,511 --> 00:10:27,347
I can't... hold... [screams]

178
00:10:29,516 --> 00:10:32,394
-[phone beeps]
-Team, to the park.

179
00:10:54,207 --> 00:10:56,835
Any sign of them? Oh, no.

180
00:10:58,503 --> 00:11:00,046
Hawkman's mace.

181
00:11:00,422 --> 00:11:02,924
-You don't think...
-[gasps] Hey, what's that?

182
00:11:03,007 --> 00:11:04,467
[chants incantation]

183
00:11:09,514 --> 00:11:12,517
It looks Kryptonian,
or maybe ancient Kryptonian,

184
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,060
because I can only make out

185
00:11:14,144 --> 00:11:15,854
a few of the... the words.

186
00:11:16,396 --> 00:11:18,565
Oh. Oh, that's not good.

187
00:11:18,648 --> 00:11:20,024
What? What does it say?

188
00:11:20,108 --> 00:11:22,861
I think this thing sent our friends
to the Phantom Zone.

189
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:25,113
You mean that creepy limbo dimension?

190
00:11:25,488 --> 00:11:27,782
But we saw what it took
to open a portal.

191
00:11:27,866 --> 00:11:28,992
How can one little ball...

192
00:11:29,075 --> 00:11:31,619
Cythonna. I'm not sure
what the rest of this says,

193
00:11:31,703 --> 00:11:34,664
but I know this says Cythonna.

194
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,709
Clearly, whatever we're up against

195
00:11:37,792 --> 00:11:40,670
is far more formidable
than we anticipated.

196
00:11:40,754 --> 00:11:41,921
We will need a plan.

197
00:11:42,005 --> 00:11:43,465
How's this for a plan?

198
00:11:43,548 --> 00:11:46,384
Find the jerks who are using stuff
from my dead homeworld

199
00:11:46,468 --> 00:11:50,388
to hurt our friends and,
formidable or not, take 'em down.

200
00:11:50,472 --> 00:11:52,807
But how do we find this Legion of Doom?

201
00:11:52,891 --> 00:11:56,144
BT dubs, very cool name.
Makes you wish

202
00:11:56,227 --> 00:11:58,480
we put a little more effort
into Super Hero Girls.

203
00:11:58,563 --> 00:12:01,608
I got a hunch this little guy
might be our biggest clue.

204
00:12:03,151 --> 00:12:05,195
Kara, where are you going?

205
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:07,030
To see a translator.

206
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:11,117
[laughs] Legion of Doom?
That's rich.

207
00:12:11,201 --> 00:12:13,495
Quit it. I think they used
Kryptonian magic

208
00:12:13,578 --> 00:12:15,538
to send my friends to the Phantom Zone.

209
00:12:16,164 --> 00:12:17,999
See, this says Cythonna.

210
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,419
[sighs] Your Kryptonian is awful.

211
00:12:21,503 --> 00:12:22,962
This doesn't say Cythonna.

212
00:12:23,046 --> 00:12:27,342
And even if it did, hello, there's no
such thing as Kryptonian magic.

213
00:12:27,425 --> 00:12:31,471
-Cythonna is a fairy tale.
-You think this is a joke?

214
00:12:31,554 --> 00:12:35,517
I'm sure your buddies are probably
just off goofing around somewhere.

215
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,268
"Goofing around"?

216
00:12:37,352 --> 00:12:39,479
Remember when you couldn't
find that one kid for two days

217
00:12:39,562 --> 00:12:41,398
because he locked himself
in a port-a-pooper?

218
00:12:41,481 --> 00:12:43,525
Garth was only locked inside one day.

219
00:12:43,608 --> 00:12:45,568
He spent the second day in the shower.

220
00:12:45,652 --> 00:12:48,863
Look, Kara. This has been fun.
But if I thought for a second

221
00:12:48,947 --> 00:12:51,282
your pals were in danger
or someone got ahold

222
00:12:51,366 --> 00:12:54,869
of a Kryptonian weapon,
believe me, I'd be all over it.

223
00:12:56,371 --> 00:12:57,372
Hmph!

224
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,583
She knows about the Phantom Zone.

225
00:13:07,382 --> 00:13:08,675
Still no guesses?

226
00:13:09,134 --> 00:13:10,009
I'll give you a hint.

227
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,929
It's not bigger than a breadbox.

228
00:13:14,723 --> 00:13:15,765
Anyone?

229
00:13:16,891 --> 00:13:18,810
Okay. One more hint.

230
00:13:19,102 --> 00:13:22,605
It's not smaller than a breadbox either.

231
00:13:23,064 --> 00:13:25,734
Hal, I ran an hour out
in all directions.

232
00:13:25,817 --> 00:13:26,818
Nothing?

233
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:30,405
Argh! And my ring still can't seem
to penetrate this darkness.

234
00:13:30,488 --> 00:13:31,448
I hate to say this.

235
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:35,118
-We're stuck here.
-[Garth] Give up?

236
00:13:35,785 --> 00:13:39,080
It is a breadbox! Gotcha!

237
00:13:44,753 --> 00:13:46,546
[grunting]

238
00:13:48,256 --> 00:13:50,091
I failed.

239
00:13:50,175 --> 00:13:53,178
-I am sorry, Mother.
-Sorry?

240
00:13:53,553 --> 00:13:56,514
"Sorry" will not shield you
from a vengeful enemy.

241
00:13:56,598 --> 00:13:59,476
Nor will it shield those who follow you.

242
00:14:03,313 --> 00:14:04,606
-[gasps]
-Worried about the Legion of Doom?

243
00:14:04,689 --> 00:14:05,523
[mace thuds]

244
00:14:05,607 --> 00:14:08,401
Why? Are you concerned
a miscalculation in my leadership

245
00:14:08,485 --> 00:14:10,612
against this unknown evil
may bring you harm?

246
00:14:10,695 --> 00:14:14,407
Do you not realize I love you all
too much to allow that to happen?

247
00:14:14,491 --> 00:14:16,242
Zeus as my witness,
Barbara Gordon,

248
00:14:16,326 --> 00:14:17,994
that will not happen!

249
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:20,163
Uh, thanks, D. I love you too.

250
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:25,043
No, I was actually thinking about
the Legion because of Harleen.

251
00:14:25,418 --> 00:14:28,213
I thought, since we found out
each other's secret, she'd,

252
00:14:28,296 --> 00:14:30,298
-you know...
-Change her ways.

253
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:33,134
I know Harleen, Diana. She's not evil.

254
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,513
It is heartbreaking, but you do realize
that, for months,

255
00:14:36,596 --> 00:14:39,391
Harley Quinn has held a supervillain's
deadliest weapon.

256
00:14:39,474 --> 00:14:41,518
A heat-seeking poison-tipped scimitar?

257
00:14:41,601 --> 00:14:43,561
Your secret identity.

258
00:14:43,645 --> 00:14:46,856
She knows who you are, and yet,
has done nothing about it.

259
00:14:47,857 --> 00:14:51,027
You're right. So, I guess there is hope.

260
00:14:51,111 --> 00:14:52,779
[Supergirl groaning]

261
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,574
Well, Super-jerk blew me off.

262
00:14:57,117 --> 00:14:58,410
[whispering] They still don't know.

263
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,246
He would not help translate that sphere?

264
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:04,165
Hmm. If only we had an ancient
Kryptonian-to-English dictionary

265
00:15:04,249 --> 00:15:05,625
lying around, huh?

266
00:15:06,084 --> 00:15:10,255
Actually, I know where we could find
something way better than a dictionary.

267
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:15,343
[Zatanna exclaims] My heat spell
maybe keeping me warm,

268
00:15:15,427 --> 00:15:18,430
but this drastic climate change
is going to be murder on my hair.

269
00:15:18,513 --> 00:15:20,932
Okay, Zee.
Don't worry. Not much farther.

270
00:15:21,015 --> 00:15:23,685
-Not much farther to what?
-That!

271
00:15:40,035 --> 00:15:43,163
-Are you sure it's okay we're here?
-Totally not. No.

272
00:15:43,246 --> 00:15:45,582
That's why he calls it
his Fortress of Solitude,

273
00:15:45,665 --> 00:15:47,208
and not, I don't know, a...

274
00:15:47,292 --> 00:15:48,960
The Buddy Bunker?
Friendship Depot?

275
00:15:49,044 --> 00:15:50,879
Ooh. Kal-El's House of ha-has.

276
00:15:50,962 --> 00:15:52,422
Stop right there.

277
00:15:55,675 --> 00:15:58,011
Oh, we're in so much trouble.

278
00:15:58,094 --> 00:15:59,554
Stop right there.

279
00:16:01,765 --> 00:16:03,641
[Supermen] Stop right there.

280
00:16:03,725 --> 00:16:05,477
Stop right there.

281
00:16:06,853 --> 00:16:10,940
Kara, how many last sons
did Krypton actually have?

282
00:16:11,191 --> 00:16:13,610
Relax, these are
just his dumb robot guards.

283
00:16:13,693 --> 00:16:15,403
Hey, they're tall, tan, and gruesome.

284
00:16:15,487 --> 00:16:18,114
It's cousin Kara. I-- Ow!

285
00:16:18,406 --> 00:16:21,159
Huh? This one must have
a loose circuit or something.

286
00:16:21,242 --> 00:16:22,994
Just gonna take a quick look-see.

287
00:16:26,331 --> 00:16:30,126
Okay. Which one of you
glorified coffee makers is next?

288
00:16:43,598 --> 00:16:44,724
[electricity crackles]

289
00:16:44,891 --> 00:16:46,726
[chants incantation]

290
00:16:46,935 --> 00:16:48,436
[straining]

291
00:16:49,437 --> 00:16:50,772
[whimpering]

292
00:16:54,692 --> 00:16:56,361
[both grunting]

293
00:16:59,989 --> 00:17:01,908
[grunts] Ha-ha.

294
00:17:06,871 --> 00:17:09,082
Hmph! Gotta say, not impressed.

295
00:17:09,165 --> 00:17:11,918
-Where is Supergirl?
-[Supergirl] She's over here, gang.

296
00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:14,838
Good news, she got what we came for.

297
00:17:14,921 --> 00:17:17,340
Ta-daa! Told you we'd be in and out.

298
00:17:17,424 --> 00:17:19,759
You sure did. In fact, you can say

299
00:17:19,843 --> 00:17:22,679
you were a-head of the game. [chuckles]

300
00:17:22,762 --> 00:17:25,765
[laughing] Oh, you're so funny.
Oh, you're so funny.

301
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:27,559
Guys, guys, I'm doing a...

302
00:17:27,642 --> 00:17:28,560
talking as both of us...

303
00:17:31,688 --> 00:17:32,564
[groans]

304
00:17:36,067 --> 00:17:38,069
So, Kara, what's in that case, anyway?

305
00:17:38,486 --> 00:17:41,698
[Supergirl] This is Krypton's
entire wealth of knowledge.

306
00:17:41,781 --> 00:17:44,242
It'll give us the true poop
on Cythonna and her amulet.

307
00:17:44,826 --> 00:17:45,744
Wow.

308
00:17:45,827 --> 00:17:49,414
A complete culture stored
in just a handful of crystals.

309
00:17:49,497 --> 00:17:53,001
[chuckles] Oh, yeah.
Kryptonians loved their crystals.

310
00:17:53,126 --> 00:17:55,211
These babies hold all kinds of things.

311
00:17:57,922 --> 00:17:58,882
Funny.

312
00:17:59,424 --> 00:18:00,967
I don't recall inviting guests.

313
00:18:01,718 --> 00:18:04,637
Another robot? I got this one.

314
00:18:04,721 --> 00:18:05,680
Batgirl, wait!

315
00:18:06,806 --> 00:18:08,183
[grunts] Ow!

316
00:18:08,266 --> 00:18:09,434
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

317
00:18:09,517 --> 00:18:11,186
He's real, he's real,
he's real, he's real!

318
00:18:12,187 --> 00:18:14,022
Put the crystals back, Kara.

319
00:18:14,731 --> 00:18:17,984
No way. Listen, Clark, I know
you don't believe me,

320
00:18:18,068 --> 00:18:20,070
but there is a huge threat.

321
00:18:20,695 --> 00:18:23,323
-I do believe you.
-Don't interrupt me!

322
00:18:23,406 --> 00:18:25,617
-Wait. Wha...
-You're right.

323
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,828
In fact, I already knew Lex Luthor
is behind the Legion of Doom,

324
00:18:28,912 --> 00:18:30,830
and that they're sending heroes
to the Phantom Zone

325
00:18:30,914 --> 00:18:34,084
-using a Kryptonian device.
-The Amulet of Cythonna.

326
00:18:34,167 --> 00:18:38,004
Wait, so, if you knew all of this,
why did you blow me off at your place?

327
00:18:38,088 --> 00:18:40,840
Because I also knew
you're out of your league.

328
00:18:40,924 --> 00:18:43,134
Luthor is not to be trifled with.

329
00:18:43,218 --> 00:18:45,011
We've taken him down before.

330
00:18:45,095 --> 00:18:47,555
Not with a deadly weapon
like this, you haven't.

331
00:18:47,639 --> 00:18:50,517
I know Luthor. This time,
he's playing for keeps.

332
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,893
What are you saying?

333
00:18:51,976 --> 00:18:53,353
What kind of hero would I be

334
00:18:53,436 --> 00:18:55,105
if I let a bunch of kids
walk off to their doom?

335
00:18:57,023 --> 00:18:58,566
Thanks, Dad.

336
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,860
You think you could stop us on your own?

337
00:19:01,653 --> 00:19:04,489
Yeah, I do. But even if I couldn't...

338
00:19:09,869 --> 00:19:11,830
[Hawaiian tune plays]

339
00:19:11,913 --> 00:19:13,415
[exclaims]

340
00:19:20,588 --> 00:19:22,132
the Justice League could.

341
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,094
The Justice League?
Another cool name!

342
00:19:26,511 --> 00:19:28,805
Yeah, I wanted to call ourselves
the Super Friends, man.

343
00:19:28,888 --> 00:19:30,265
But I got out-voted.

344
00:19:30,348 --> 00:19:31,975
[sighs] So unfair.

345
00:19:32,434 --> 00:19:35,979
I mean, we appreciate
the concern, gentlemen,

346
00:19:36,062 --> 00:19:38,481
but we are more than capable
of handling ourselves.

347
00:19:39,399 --> 00:19:41,359
Yeah, Jon, you helped train me on Oa.

348
00:19:41,443 --> 00:19:43,027
I was the top of my class.

349
00:19:43,111 --> 00:19:45,321
Sorry, rookie.
Pacifism won't cut it this time.

350
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,865
Punches have got to be thrown.

351
00:19:47,991 --> 00:19:49,367
[Batgirl exhales] This is just dumb.

352
00:19:49,951 --> 00:19:51,119
Batman, buddy.

353
00:19:51,202 --> 00:19:53,288
Tell these guys how we saved Gotham.

354
00:19:53,997 --> 00:19:55,081
[hoarsely] Not this time.

355
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,000
What do you mean, not this time.

356
00:19:57,876 --> 00:19:59,461
The league already has a plan.

357
00:19:59,586 --> 00:20:01,337
Frankly, you'd only be
getting in the way.

358
00:20:01,838 --> 00:20:03,548
Our friends are the ones in trouble.

359
00:20:03,882 --> 00:20:08,178
So, if we're in your way,
go ahead and move us.

360
00:20:08,678 --> 00:20:09,804
[Supergirl grunts]

361

366

Diamagnetic repulsor.
[gasps] So cool.

367
00:20:28,406 --> 00:20:29,741
I may not be swinging fists,

368
00:20:29,824 --> 00:20:32,118
but I have no problem
restraining you in one.

369
00:20:32,702 --> 00:20:33,578
I'm gonna disagree,

370
00:20:33,787 --> 00:20:35,663
and say you have a pretty big problem.

371
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,459
[Zatanna gushes]

372
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:40,460
So, uh,

373
00:20:40,543 --> 00:20:41,753
shouldn't we be fighting?

374
00:20:41,836 --> 00:20:43,338
Feel like we're just kinda
standing here.

375
00:20:43,797 --> 00:20:45,423
Oh, [clears throat]
I don't care.

376
00:20:45,673 --> 00:20:46,674
I'm up for whatever.

377
00:20:46,883 --> 00:20:47,842
What do you feel like?

378
00:20:49,761 --> 00:20:50,804
[Supergirl grunts]

379
00:20:51,054 --> 00:20:52,222
Kara, stay down.

380
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:54,391
[sighs] Can't you see
I'm trying to protect you?

381
00:20:54,474 --> 00:20:55,558
[Kara groans]

382
00:20:56,017 --> 00:20:58,269
Do we look like we need protecting?

383
00:20:58,645 --> 00:20:59,771
[grunts]

384
00:21:01,815 --> 00:21:03,441
[both grunting]

385
00:21:05,652 --> 00:21:06,653
Enough!

386
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:12,200
Woohoo, you guys are in trouble now.

387
00:21:12,784 --> 00:21:13,618
Superman,

388
00:21:13,702 --> 00:21:14,786
you say you have a plan

389
00:21:14,869 --> 00:21:17,038
stop the Legion of Doom
and free our friends?

390
00:21:17,205 --> 00:21:18,206
Yes.

391
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:19,541
What about Cythonna?

392
00:21:19,874 --> 00:21:21,668
There is no Cythonna, Kara.

393
00:21:22,043 --> 00:21:24,212
The ancient science
that amulet uses may be deadly.

394
00:21:24,462 --> 00:21:25,630
But it's just another weapon.

395
00:21:25,964 --> 00:21:28,258
Once it's out of the wrong
hands, it's harmless.

396
00:21:28,341 --> 00:21:30,093
And you are confident in your plan?

397
00:21:30,176 --> 00:21:31,136
What do you think?

398
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:34,514
[dramatic music playing]

399
00:21:38,601 --> 00:21:40,395
We shall defer to the Justice League.

400

[all gasp]

401
00:21:43,481 --> 00:21:46,192
[suspenseful music playing]

402
00:21:48,153 --> 00:21:49,612
[Supergirl] Are you kidding me?

403
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,864
[girls groan]

404
00:21:55,201 --> 00:21:56,828
Ooh! I can't wait till those

405
00:21:56,911 --> 00:21:58,621
Super Hero Girls show their faces.

406
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:02,167
And we send them to limbo for eternity.

407
00:22:02,417 --> 00:22:03,835
[all cackling]

408
00:22:05,587 --> 00:22:07,714
Yeah, but since it's eternity,

409
00:22:07,797 --> 00:22:08,757
we got time.

410
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,633
I mean, it's not like
we have to send them

411
00:22:10,717 --> 00:22:12,010
to limbo today.

412
00:22:12,677 --> 00:22:14,471
[Poison Ivy laughing]

413
00:22:20,018 --> 00:22:21,895
You must be so proud.

414
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,772
As their confidence grows,

415
00:22:23,855 --> 00:22:25,398
so does their malevolence.

416
00:22:26,649 --> 00:22:28,151
Have you forgotten, Cythonna?

417
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:30,612
You are a silent partner.

418
00:22:30,695 --> 00:22:31,529
[Cythonna scoffs]

419
00:22:31,613 --> 00:22:35,116
Of course not. I appear to only you,
in this astral form.

420
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,368
[Lex Luthor shudders]

421
00:22:36,451 --> 00:22:37,619
Albeit, weakly,

422
00:22:37,911 --> 00:22:39,829
for, as you know,

423
00:22:39,913 --> 00:22:41,456
my powers are limited

424
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,916
while I remain trapped

425
00:22:42,999 --> 00:22:46,211
within this cursed prison forever.

426
00:22:46,711 --> 00:22:47,670
It's not all bad.

427
00:22:47,879 --> 00:22:48,755
Possessing your prison

428
00:22:48,838 --> 00:22:50,924
grants me access to that limited power.

429
00:22:51,007 --> 00:22:52,092
In return,

430
00:22:52,342 --> 00:22:53,385
I only ask--

431
00:22:53,468 --> 00:22:54,636
Oh, I know what you want.

432
00:22:54,719 --> 00:22:56,554
And perhaps once I,
Lex Luther, am victorious,

433
00:22:56,638 --> 00:22:57,764
I will indulge you.

434
00:22:58,765 --> 00:22:59,766
If I'm in a good mood.

435
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:03,478
You haven't begun to know what I want.

436
00:23:03,561 --> 00:23:06,231
[mysterious music playing]

437
00:23:06,439 --> 00:23:08,775
[Supergirl] <i>We're gonna defer</i>
<i>to the league?</i>

438
00:23:08,858 --> 00:23:09,943
Okay, I'll admit,

439
00:23:10,026 --> 00:23:11,444
I don't know what defer means,

440
00:23:11,653 --> 00:23:12,904
but I'm pretty sure you told him,

441
00:23:12,987 --> 00:23:14,197
we just roll over.

442
00:23:14,989 --> 00:23:17,659
Since when do we back down from a fight?

443
00:23:17,909 --> 00:23:20,036
-Are you afraid--
-I am an Amazon!

444
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,663
I fear no fight.

445
00:23:23,289 --> 00:23:24,124
Kara,

446
00:23:24,207 --> 00:23:27,001
your will is the strongest
of any warrior I have known.

447
00:23:27,168 --> 00:23:29,337
And while that is part
of what makes you so mighty,

448
00:23:29,421 --> 00:23:31,172
it can also make you vulnerable

449
00:23:31,256 --> 00:23:32,966
when you allow it to become
bullheadedness.

450
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:34,884
This brings me no pleasure either.

451
00:23:35,343 --> 00:23:36,928
But you chose me as your leader,

452
00:23:37,011 --> 00:23:38,555
not to make popular decisions.

453
00:23:38,638 --> 00:23:39,681
But the tough ones.

454
00:23:39,764 --> 00:23:41,933
And what if the League
blows it? Then what, huh?

455
00:23:42,016 --> 00:23:45,019
We left our only clue to stopping
anything at the North Pole.

456
00:23:45,103 --> 00:23:45,937
[doorbell chiming]

457
00:23:46,563 --> 00:23:47,731
[sighs wearily]

458
00:23:47,814 --> 00:23:49,107
[cell phone ringing]

459
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:54,487
Ugh.

460
00:23:54,946 --> 00:23:56,030
[Supergirl grunts]

461
00:23:56,406 --> 00:23:57,240
Say, Kara,

462
00:23:57,323 --> 00:24:00,160
what was that about leaving
our only clue at the North Pole?

463
00:24:00,243 --> 00:24:03,246
You swiped my cousin's data crystals.

464
00:24:04,247 --> 00:24:05,373
[laughs]

465
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:08,251
[euphoric music playing]

466
00:24:09,878 --> 00:24:11,337
[Superman] Bet your friends
are mad at you, huh?

467
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,506
[Diana] Superman?

468
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,883
This was from you?

469
00:24:14,966 --> 00:24:16,134
From him, actually.

470
00:24:16,676 --> 00:24:18,303
[mutters indistinctly]

471
00:24:18,386 --> 00:24:19,554
Join you!

472
00:24:19,637 --> 00:24:21,973
I am sorry, but I already belong
to a team.

473
00:24:22,265 --> 00:24:23,558
A team you dismissed!

474
00:24:23,641 --> 00:24:25,143
Look, I don't know you well,

475
00:24:25,393 --> 00:24:26,561
but I do know you'd never back down

476
00:24:26,644 --> 00:24:28,229
from a fight against evil.

477
00:24:28,313 --> 00:24:29,814
The only reason you stepped aside

478
00:24:29,898 --> 00:24:30,940
was to protect them.

479
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,776
Because, at the end of the day,

480
00:24:33,193 --> 00:24:34,235
they are just kids.

481
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:35,695
[mutters indistinctly]

482
00:24:35,779 --> 00:24:38,198
And how exactly am I different, Batman?

483
00:24:42,702 --> 00:24:43,870
[Superman] You're no kid.

484
00:24:43,953 --> 00:24:46,081
You got more combat expertise
than any of us.

485
00:24:46,581 --> 00:24:48,541
I have sworn to protect this world.

486
00:24:48,708 --> 00:24:50,585
And to stand up to any threat.

487
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:51,961
But-- [sighs]

488
00:24:52,754 --> 00:24:54,631
But you're worried about
dissing your friends?

489
00:24:54,714 --> 00:24:56,132
This is bigger than that, Diana.

490
00:24:56,299 --> 00:24:57,175
If Luthor wins,

491
00:24:57,258 --> 00:24:59,135
a lot more than feelings
are gonna get hurt.

Uh, Kara,

00:25:11,773 --> 00:25:13,942
I know this is like a piece
from your lost planet.

498
00:25:14,067 --> 00:25:16,903
So, please don't take this
the wrong way, but, snore.

499
00:25:17,612 --> 00:25:18,863
Zee, don't be rude!

[machine whirring]

501
00:25:20,323 --> 00:25:21,825
But can we just skip
to the part about the amulet?

[Jessica slurping]

503
00:25:23,535 --> 00:25:26,538
And for such
a technologically-advanced society,

That'll take days.

00:25:42,095 --> 00:25:43,054

00:26:20,717 --> 00:26:21,551
[slams machine]

524
00:26:21,634 --> 00:26:23,178
Lead flash fryer and tomato slicer

525
00:26:23,261 --> 00:26:25,055
at Krypton's number one
fast food chain--

526
00:26:25,138 --> 00:26:26,097
[Supergirl shushes] Here it is.

527
00:26:27,015 --> 00:26:29,184
<i>Long believed to be merely a relic</i>

528
00:26:29,267 --> 00:26:30,643
<i>from a lost science,</i>

529
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:33,271
<i>the Amulet of Cythonna is, in fact,</i>

530
00:26:33,646 --> 00:26:35,190
<i>something far more sinister.</i>

531
00:26:35,899 --> 00:26:38,109
<i>For as impossible as it may seem,</i>

532
00:26:38,193 --> 00:26:39,652
<i>the crystal within</i>

533
00:26:39,986 --> 00:26:41,404
<i>does, in fact, contain</i>

534
00:26:41,738 --> 00:26:45,116
<i>the essence of the Goddess of Darkness.</i>

535
00:26:45,658 --> 00:26:46,659
Wait...

536
00:26:46,868 --> 00:26:48,453
The actual goddess?

537
00:26:48,536 --> 00:26:49,454
<i>For eons,</i>

538
00:26:49,704 --> 00:26:50,997
<i>the imprisoned Cythonna</i>

539
00:26:51,081 --> 00:26:52,665
<i>has floated through the cosmos,</i>

540
00:26:52,749 --> 00:26:54,501
<i>in search of the one thing</i>

541
00:26:54,793 --> 00:26:56,211
<i>that may free her.</i>

542
00:26:56,294 --> 00:26:57,295
<i>Evil!</i>

543
00:26:57,879 --> 00:26:59,672
<i>She feeds on the souls</i>

544
00:26:59,756 --> 00:27:00,840
<i>of the wicked.</i>

545
00:27:00,924 --> 00:27:02,675
Like Luthor and the Legion of Doom.

546
00:27:02,842 --> 00:27:05,553
<i>The souls will become her servants</i>

547
00:27:05,762 --> 00:27:06,805
<i>and, in turn,</i>

548
00:27:07,263 --> 00:27:09,891
<i>create more evil for her to devour.</i>

549
00:27:11,017 --> 00:27:11,935
Ooh, I get it.

550
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,436
Luthor isn't using Cythonna.

551
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,979
She's using him.

552
00:27:15,522 --> 00:27:16,689
That's actually way worse.

553
00:27:16,773 --> 00:27:18,733
<i>Once she has become strong enough,</i>

554
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:21,486
<i>-she will free herself from her prison.</i>
-[crystal shattering]

555
00:27:21,569 --> 00:27:22,654
-[all gasp]
<i>-She will assume</i>

556
00:27:22,737 --> 00:27:25,031
<i>a new Kryptonian vessel</i>

557
00:27:25,115 --> 00:27:27,075
<i>and reclaim the universe</i>

558
00:27:27,283 --> 00:27:28,535
<i>as her dominion.</i>

559
00:27:30,704 --> 00:27:33,707
The League has totally underestimated
what they're up against.

560
00:27:34,791 --> 00:27:36,793
[gasps] We have to warn Aquaman.

561
00:27:36,876 --> 00:27:38,128
I mean, the League.

562
00:27:38,253 --> 00:27:39,129
We have to warn the League.

563
00:27:39,713 --> 00:27:40,672
I'll call Diana.

564
00:27:41,381 --> 00:27:42,257
Kara, what do you think

565
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,801
your uncle meant by
"a new Kryptonian vessel"?

566
00:27:45,385 --> 00:27:46,553
I don't know.

567
00:27:46,803 --> 00:27:48,763
Well, I guess we could listen
to some more of my uncle--

568
00:27:48,888 --> 00:27:50,348
-[Jessica] I was just curious.
-No way.

569
00:27:50,515 --> 00:27:51,725
[Batgirl] Guys.

570
00:27:51,808 --> 00:27:53,017
Diana's not answering.

571
00:27:55,937 --> 00:27:57,105
Hey, what's going on?

572
00:27:57,188 --> 00:27:59,190
I thought this was
supposed to be a crossover.

573
00:27:59,274 --> 00:28:00,608
Not that I'm complaining,

574
00:28:00,692 --> 00:28:02,736
but we haven't done anything here.

575
00:28:02,819 --> 00:28:04,571
While I am enjoying the escapades

576
00:28:04,654 --> 00:28:07,157
of the heroes
that are both girls and super,

577
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,952
I do not see any evidence
of the crossing or the over.

578
00:28:11,036 --> 00:28:13,580
Yeah, and what's the big deal
about this crossover anyway?

579
00:28:13,663 --> 00:28:16,166
We already met the Super Hero Girls
a bunch of times.

580
00:28:16,249 --> 00:28:18,251
Youse were even there
one time, you remembers?

581
00:28:18,334 --> 00:28:20,253
That was on your show, you clowns.

582
00:28:20,503 --> 00:28:23,339
And while your show plays fast
and loose with internal logic,

583
00:28:23,423 --> 00:28:25,091
throws continuity out its window,

584
00:28:25,175 --> 00:28:28,261
and chooses poop jokes
over actual story,

585
00:28:28,553 --> 00:28:31,514
their show maintains
a coherent, cohesive narrative.

586
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:34,142
Yeah, but how are their ratings?

587
00:28:34,851 --> 00:28:37,312
-Meh.
-[gasps] Wait a minute.

588
00:28:37,562 --> 00:28:38,396
That's it.

589
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,607
We're not glomming onto
their popularity.

590
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,150
They're glomming on to ours.

591
00:28:42,233 --> 00:28:43,151
[all gasp]

592
00:28:43,234 --> 00:28:45,278
I's, I's don't knows what to says.

593
00:28:45,528 --> 00:28:46,613
I feel so,

594
00:28:46,863 --> 00:28:48,531
so used right now.

595
00:28:49,199 --> 00:28:50,033
Indeed.

596
00:28:50,116 --> 00:28:51,993
Much like the bauble
that Beast Boy for used

597
00:28:52,077 --> 00:28:53,495
for the propping up of the TV.

598
00:28:53,578 --> 00:28:55,747
I too am feeling wedged into something,

599
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,415
to which I do not belong.

600
00:28:57,499 --> 00:29:00,502
With the assigned, expressed
purpose of holding it up.

601
00:29:01,503 --> 00:29:03,380
This stinks, Control Freak.

602
00:29:03,463 --> 00:29:05,090
Oh, come now, Robin.

603
00:29:05,173 --> 00:29:06,216
I thought you'd be flattered

604
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:07,884
by how much they think of your funny,

605
00:29:07,967 --> 00:29:10,136
action-packed, popular show.

606
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,430
Oh. Well, you flatter us.

607
00:29:12,514 --> 00:29:14,265
It is pretty-- Hey!

608
00:29:14,432 --> 00:29:16,101
You can't blow me off with compliments.

609
00:29:16,184 --> 00:29:18,311
Yeah. I mean, if you don't
give us this event,

610
00:29:18,436 --> 00:29:19,687
at least you can give us something.

611
00:29:19,771 --> 00:29:21,106
Like a song, yo.

612
00:29:21,314 --> 00:29:22,440
Break it down, Cy.

613
00:29:23,274 --> 00:29:26,194
<i>You say you got us</i>
<i>In this crossover thang</i>

614
00:29:27,987 --> 00:29:29,781
<i>But this ain't how it's supposed to go</i>

615
00:29:29,948 --> 00:29:32,033
<i>It ain't supposed to be like this, y'all</i>

616
00:29:33,034 --> 00:29:35,245
<i>Where's the part where we</i>
<i>Meet the other team</i>

617
00:29:35,328 --> 00:29:37,163
<i>And then laughing</i>

618
00:29:37,831 --> 00:29:39,582
<i>And the dumb misunderstandings</i>

619
00:29:39,666 --> 00:29:42,502
<i>-That bring us to blows</i>
<i>-Oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

620
00:29:42,585 --> 00:29:44,963
<i>-Don't crossover my heart</i>
<i>-Don't do it</i>

621
00:29:45,046 --> 00:29:47,257
<i>Don't crossover my heart</i>

622
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,134
<i>We must find the compare and contrast</i>

623
00:29:49,217 --> 00:29:51,886
<i>-To our counterparts</i>
<i>-Yeah</i>

624
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:54,431
<i>Don't forget the obligatory romance</i>

625
00:29:54,514 --> 00:29:56,641
<i>-Between two crossed hearts</i>
<i>-Don't push it, Rob</i>

626
00:29:56,975 --> 00:29:59,310
<i>Don't crossover my heart</i>

627
00:29:59,394 --> 00:30:01,187
<i>Don't crossover</i>

628
00:30:01,271 --> 00:30:02,188
[Control Freak screams] Stop!

629
00:30:02,856 --> 00:30:05,108
And you wonder why you're not
featured in this event more.

630
00:30:05,191 --> 00:30:06,234
[scoffs]

631
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,158
My trap has been set.

632
00:30:13,783 --> 00:30:15,660
Any remaining heroes
who oppose me will be crushed.

633
00:30:16,286 --> 00:30:17,829
But what of the Kryptonian?

634
00:30:18,747 --> 00:30:21,082
Look, I haven't forgotten your request.

635
00:30:22,459 --> 00:30:24,836
Perhaps I'll honor it. If it suits me.

636
00:30:25,003 --> 00:30:27,839
[dramatic music playing]

637
00:30:27,922 --> 00:30:29,466
And it does suit me.

638
00:30:29,883 --> 00:30:31,801
The Kryptonian you require
will arrive shortly.

639
00:30:35,889 --> 00:30:37,182
[cracks]

640
00:30:38,808 --> 00:30:43,063
The Legion's evil is making me stronger
by the second.

641
00:30:43,146 --> 00:30:45,065
Soon, I shall be free.

642
00:30:48,902 --> 00:30:50,945
I don't see any sign of Diana up here.

643
00:30:51,821 --> 00:30:53,573
I'm coming up empty too.

644
00:30:53,907 --> 00:30:55,367
Ugh, we better regroup.

645
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:57,744
So the last any of us heard from her was

646
00:30:57,827 --> 00:30:59,245
that group text from an hour ago.

647
00:31:00,246 --> 00:31:01,081
Right!

648
00:31:01,164 --> 00:31:02,624
The one that just said, "I'm in"?

649
00:31:02,791 --> 00:31:04,334
Yeah, but in what?

650
00:31:04,793 --> 00:31:06,044
Actually, looking at this again,

651
00:31:06,127 --> 00:31:07,796
I think the real question might be,

652
00:31:08,505 --> 00:31:11,591
who are all these other numbers
she included on that text?

653
00:31:11,674 --> 00:31:14,260
I just assumed it was another one
of Diana's tech goofs,

654
00:31:14,344 --> 00:31:16,554
because I don't
recognize any of the numbers.

655
00:31:16,638 --> 00:31:17,597
[Supergirl] I do.

656
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,848
This is Clark's.

657
00:31:19,015 --> 00:31:21,184
And this one comes up as Jon Stewart.

658
00:31:23,395 --> 00:31:25,271
Batman's emergency line is here too.

659
00:31:26,689 --> 00:31:28,942
So, maybe including these other numbers

660
00:31:29,317 --> 00:31:30,485
wasn't a mistake.

661
00:31:30,777 --> 00:31:33,238
But including ours was.

662
00:31:34,364 --> 00:31:36,282
And when Diana said "I'm in",

663
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,534
she meant...

664
00:31:37,617 --> 00:31:39,160
In the Justice League.

665
00:31:41,204 --> 00:31:42,288
Just curious.

666
00:31:42,372 --> 00:31:43,748
That would make this last number

667
00:31:43,832 --> 00:31:45,041
Aquaman's, right? [giggles]

668
00:31:47,877 --> 00:31:49,838
[dramatic music playing]

669
00:31:49,921 --> 00:31:52,882
Batman's traced the amulet's radiation
signature to this swamp.

670
00:31:52,966 --> 00:31:54,592
<i>We should be closing in</i>
<i>on the Legion's headquarters</i>

671
00:31:54,676 --> 00:31:55,593
<i>any second now.</i>

672
00:31:55,927 --> 00:31:57,846
Ah, about time, man.

673
00:31:57,929 --> 00:31:59,305
That dude can build anything
with that ring.

674
00:31:59,389 --> 00:32:01,641
Try a little lumbar support
next time. Am I right?

675
00:32:03,643 --> 00:32:05,437
Oh, okay. Another serious one, huh?

676
00:32:05,603 --> 00:32:06,479
I am sorry?

677
00:32:06,563 --> 00:32:07,772
No, no, it's cool.

678
00:32:07,856 --> 00:32:10,442
Just between Sergeant Green-never-grin,

679
00:32:10,525 --> 00:32:12,610
Dracula man and the Ego Scout,

680
00:32:12,694 --> 00:32:15,155
[whispering] this team's got
the personality of a sea sponge.

681
00:32:16,114 --> 00:32:18,658
I do not know this
Sergeant Green-never grin.

682
00:32:19,743 --> 00:32:21,619
[chuckles] All right.

683
00:32:21,745 --> 00:32:24,080
Well, none of these guys
has a sense of humor.

684
00:32:24,289 --> 00:32:26,207
[Superman over radio] <i>All right, team.</i>
<i>Let's go over the plan.</i>

685
00:32:26,374 --> 00:32:28,043
Superman will lead the direct strike.

686
00:32:28,168 --> 00:32:29,878
While Batman uses the distraction

687
00:32:29,961 --> 00:32:31,504
to sneak in and steal the amulet.

688
00:32:31,713 --> 00:32:35,175
[muttering]

689
00:32:36,551 --> 00:32:37,385
I'm gonna be honest here,

690
00:32:37,469 --> 00:32:39,387
I am not completely sure
what he just said,

691
00:32:39,471 --> 00:32:41,097
but I think it had something to do with

692
00:32:41,181 --> 00:32:43,433
using the amulet
to free the other dudes?

693
00:32:43,516 --> 00:32:44,809
[muttering]

694
00:32:44,893 --> 00:32:46,394
All right, and then destroy the amulet.

695
00:32:46,478 --> 00:32:47,645
[laughs] Right.

696
00:32:47,729 --> 00:32:48,980
Is it just me, or is anyone else

697
00:32:49,064 --> 00:32:50,398
having trouble understanding
the bat guy?

698
00:32:50,607 --> 00:32:52,192
'Cause I'd be surprised
if it was just me

699
00:32:52,275 --> 00:32:53,943
'cause I can understand jellyfish.

700
00:32:54,527 --> 00:32:55,653
[Superman over the radio] <i>Got a visual.</i>

701
00:32:55,737 --> 00:32:57,614
[dramatic music playing]

702
00:32:59,574 --> 00:33:01,409
<i>And it looks like everyone's home.</i>

703
00:33:02,827 --> 00:33:04,287
[explosion]

704
00:33:04,537 --> 00:33:05,830
Game's over, Luthor.

705
00:33:18,802 --> 00:33:19,886
[shatters]

706
00:33:19,969 --> 00:33:21,346
Yep, it's a phony.

707
00:33:21,471 --> 00:33:23,390
Just something I whipped up
to get your attention.

708
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,683
I call it a trans-thermal transmitter,

709
00:33:25,767 --> 00:33:27,560
but you can call it a trap.

710
00:33:31,898 --> 00:33:33,066
[metal clanks]

711
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:37,237
And you were
supposed to be the smart one.

712
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,196
All right, team.

713
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:41,241
[dramatic music playing]

714
00:33:41,366 --> 00:33:42,367
This shouldn't take long.

715
00:33:44,077 --> 00:33:45,036
[grunts]

716
00:33:49,374 --> 00:33:50,208
Huh?

717
00:33:53,378 --> 00:33:55,463
-[Wonder Woman grunts]
-[growling]

718
00:33:55,588 --> 00:33:56,589
Uh.

719
00:33:59,467 --> 00:34:02,637
[suspenseful music playing]

720
00:34:03,304 --> 00:34:04,139
[Diana] Huh?

721
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:06,307
Holograms?

722
00:34:06,725 --> 00:34:08,309
-What have you--
-[Superman] Okay, be cool.

723
00:34:08,393 --> 00:34:10,395
We may have walked into--
[grunts]

724
00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:15,900
Whatever that thing is,

725
00:34:15,984 --> 00:34:17,360
-it's made of--
-[Luthor] Kryptonite.

726
00:34:21,156 --> 00:34:22,615
[cackling]

727
00:34:27,037 --> 00:34:28,913
I have what I need. Dispose of the rest.

728
00:34:31,374 --> 00:34:32,709
Stand strong, League!

729
00:34:49,642 --> 00:34:50,602
Hey!

730
00:34:50,685 --> 00:34:51,811
That's not cool, man.

731
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,235
So not cool, man.

732
00:35:04,365 --> 00:35:07,160
[giggling] Where are your
little friends?

733
00:35:07,452 --> 00:35:09,412
This won't be the same without them.

734
00:35:09,496 --> 00:35:11,206
They're no threat to us now.

735
00:35:11,289 --> 00:35:14,542
Especially without their
precious captain.

736
00:35:15,168 --> 00:35:18,046
Hold up! This one's mine.

737
00:35:18,129 --> 00:35:19,631
[both grunting]

738
00:35:19,964 --> 00:35:22,008
[grunts] Harley Quinn?

739
00:35:22,175 --> 00:35:24,594
-I will not spare--
-Ah, zip it would ya?

740
00:35:24,761 --> 00:35:26,346
-[grunts]
-[Diana] What is this?

741
00:35:26,429 --> 00:35:27,931
-[hinges creaking]
-[exhales]

742
00:35:28,056 --> 00:35:29,682
These guys are out of control,

743
00:35:29,766 --> 00:35:31,518
and they're getting eviler
by the second.

744
00:35:31,601 --> 00:35:33,186
You need to get Babs
and your pals together

745
00:35:33,269 --> 00:35:34,270
and save the day,

746
00:35:34,354 --> 00:35:36,231
like you jerks always do.

747
00:35:37,482 --> 00:35:40,235
Harleen, I am afraid that is unlikely.

748
00:35:40,402 --> 00:35:41,569
For you see, I have--

749
00:35:41,653 --> 00:35:44,739
Ain't that something. I don't care, go.

750
00:35:45,281 --> 00:35:46,783
-But--
-[door slams]

751
00:35:47,158 --> 00:35:49,828
Uh... Ra-koom!

752
00:35:52,914 --> 00:35:56,334
Uh, welp, add another one
to the old Phantom Zone.

753
00:35:56,876 --> 00:35:58,878
[exclaims]

754
00:36:06,886 --> 00:36:10,682
So, I take it things aren't
going well on the other side.

755
00:36:12,183 --> 00:36:13,393
I can't believe the Legion of Doom

756
00:36:13,476 --> 00:36:15,311
took out a team
of heavy hitters like you.

757
00:36:15,437 --> 00:36:16,855
I can't believe you formed your own team

758
00:36:16,938 --> 00:36:19,065
and didn't call it, "Super Friends."

759
00:36:19,149 --> 00:36:20,525
[scoffs] Told you.

760
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:23,653
And I can't believe
you didn't ask Hal Jordan

761
00:36:23,737 --> 00:36:26,156
to be your Green Lantern. I mean, Jon,

762
00:36:26,281 --> 00:36:27,866
you're cool and all, but...

763
00:36:29,451 --> 00:36:30,994
[whines] Come on!

764
00:36:32,037 --> 00:36:33,955
Hal Jordan!

765
00:36:34,664 --> 00:36:36,166
Unbelievable.

766
00:36:36,249 --> 00:36:37,625
She sold us out.

767
00:36:37,709 --> 00:36:39,502
Look, we're all mad at Diana,

768
00:36:39,586 --> 00:36:41,588
but we have to trust her decision.

769
00:36:41,713 --> 00:36:42,881
Tell 'em, Jess.

770
00:36:42,964 --> 00:36:46,301
Honestly, right now, I don't know.

771
00:36:46,384 --> 00:36:48,970
All my life, people have been
selling me short.

772
00:36:49,137 --> 00:36:51,097
But, Diana?

773
00:36:51,181 --> 00:36:53,892
I'm sure she's got
the team's best interests at heart.

774
00:36:53,975 --> 00:36:55,435
Face it, Babs.

775
00:36:55,518 --> 00:36:56,770
She dumped us.

776
00:36:58,229 --> 00:37:00,690
No, she loves us more than anything.

777
00:37:00,774 --> 00:37:02,025
I mean, after what she went through,

778
00:37:02,108 --> 00:37:03,401
with me and Harley Quinn alone...

779
00:37:03,568 --> 00:37:05,028
[grunting]

780
00:37:05,528 --> 00:37:07,530
What about you and Harley?

781
00:37:08,031 --> 00:37:09,949
Oh, did I not mention

782
00:37:10,033 --> 00:37:11,743
Harley Quinn and Harleen Quinzel

783
00:37:11,826 --> 00:37:13,370
are actually one in the same?

784
00:37:13,578 --> 00:37:15,163
I mean, saying the names together,

785
00:37:15,246 --> 00:37:17,040
it's kind of obvious,
so you probably already

786
00:37:17,123 --> 00:37:18,625
figured it out. Right?

787
00:37:18,792 --> 00:37:20,752
You and Diana knew

788
00:37:20,835 --> 00:37:23,463
your bestie was a super villain
and you didn't tell us?

789
00:37:23,546 --> 00:37:25,965
Technically, ex-bestie.

790
00:37:26,216 --> 00:37:28,760
She threw me off a train, Barbara!

791
00:37:29,886 --> 00:37:32,180
-[Jessica] Zee?
-[gasps]

792
00:37:33,014 --> 00:37:35,392
Babs, I... [sighs]

793
00:37:35,475 --> 00:37:36,476
Forget it.

794
00:37:36,684 --> 00:37:37,894
I quit.

795
00:37:38,603 --> 00:37:40,105
Yup, me too.

796
00:37:41,147 --> 00:37:42,315
What do we do?

797
00:37:42,399 --> 00:37:43,775
What is there to do?

798
00:37:43,858 --> 00:37:45,860
The League is handling the bad guys,

799
00:37:46,611 --> 00:37:48,571
so, I guess...

800
00:37:49,656 --> 00:37:50,865
We go home.

801
00:37:55,912 --> 00:37:58,289
<i>Good evening. Lex Luthor here.</i>

802
00:37:58,373 --> 00:38:00,208
<i>You know me</i>
<i>as the entrepreneurial genius</i>

803
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:01,626
<i>who built a billion-dollar empire</i>

804
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:02,544
<i>with nothing more than his</i>

805
00:38:02,627 --> 00:38:05,046
<i>preternatural savvy</i>
<i>and indomitable drive.</i>

806
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:07,424
Today, I am allowing
these gifts to serve

807
00:38:07,507 --> 00:38:08,967
a much higher purpose.

808
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:11,761
But first, I'd like to introduce
you to some friends of mine.

809
00:38:12,512 --> 00:38:14,723
The Legion of Doom.

810
00:38:15,849 --> 00:38:17,183
[all gasping]

811
00:38:17,267 --> 00:38:18,184
<i>I know, I know.</i>

812
00:38:18,268 --> 00:38:19,686
<i>Pretty cool name. Am I right?</i>

813
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:22,063
Anyway, about my new higher purpose.

814
00:38:22,522 --> 00:38:23,648
I, Lex Luthor

815
00:38:23,732 --> 00:38:25,150
<i>and my Legion of Doom,</i>

816
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:28,027
<i>are going to take over the world.</i>

817
00:38:29,362 --> 00:38:31,197
<i>You're saying, "Come on, Lex.</i>

818
00:38:31,281 --> 00:38:32,991
<i>How are you going</i>
<i>to take over the world?"</i>

819
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:34,367
<i>Simple.</i>

820
00:38:36,453 --> 00:38:37,954
<i>You're gonna give it to us.</i>

821
00:38:38,246 --> 00:38:40,290
<i>Cast your eyes skyward, folks.</i>

822
00:38:40,373 --> 00:38:43,084
[machine whirring]

823
00:38:46,463 --> 00:38:49,299
All right, Cythonna,
show us what you can really do.

824
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,895
[people murmuring]

825
00:39:04,814 --> 00:39:07,067
<i>So, this is when I say,</i>

826
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:09,527
<i>you have 24 hours to meet our demands.</i>

827
00:39:09,652 --> 00:39:10,695
[crowd gasping]

828
00:39:11,196 --> 00:39:13,114
Oh, my gosh. I forgot the best part.

829
00:39:13,364 --> 00:39:15,367
Don't look for any clowns in tights
to save you.

830
00:39:15,533 --> 00:39:16,743
We've gotten rid of them all.

831
00:39:17,243 --> 00:39:18,995
Well, the important ones, anyway.

832
00:39:19,371 --> 00:39:20,955
[all laughing]

833
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:23,708
You now have 23 hours and 59 minutes.

834
00:39:29,464 --> 00:39:32,133
Since when you become
the brooding type of bat?

835
00:39:32,217 --> 00:39:34,427
[growls] You picked the wrong time
to mess with...

836
00:39:34,677 --> 00:39:35,637
Harleen?

837
00:39:35,804 --> 00:39:37,597
-Where is the...
-Jester get-up?

838
00:39:37,722 --> 00:39:39,182
Ah, taking a break.

839
00:39:39,641 --> 00:39:43,103
Turns out I'm a big fan
of causing chaos,

840
00:39:43,311 --> 00:39:44,979
but destroying the world?

841
00:39:45,063 --> 00:39:46,564
Eh, not so much.

842
00:39:46,815 --> 00:39:48,066
You quit the Legion?

843
00:39:48,691 --> 00:39:50,735
Does this mean
you're not a bad guy anymore?

844
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:53,363
Let's just say, I'm taking a sabbatical.

845
00:39:53,613 --> 00:39:54,489
Really?

846
00:39:55,198 --> 00:39:57,242
Well, you couldn't have
quit at a better time.

847
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:00,120
A group of A-list heroes like
Wonder Woman is about to kick their...

848
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:01,287
What?

849
00:40:01,371 --> 00:40:02,914
You don't know, do you?

850
00:40:02,997 --> 00:40:03,873
Know what?

851
00:40:03,957 --> 00:40:06,710
Eesh, Babs! Current events much?

852
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,378
[cell phone ringing]

853
00:40:09,546 --> 00:40:12,090
[Karen] <i>Babs, emergency</i>
<i>at the junkyard. Hurry!</i>

854
00:40:17,053 --> 00:40:18,513
Bumblebee, I'm here.

855
00:40:18,638 --> 00:40:19,681
Where are you?

856
00:40:19,764 --> 00:40:21,182
Bumblebee, are you okay?

857
00:40:24,227 --> 00:40:25,395
Hmph!

858
00:40:26,354 --> 00:40:27,981
You got Bumblebee's distress call too?

859
00:40:28,106 --> 00:40:29,357
[sighs] Harley Quinn.

860
00:40:29,941 --> 00:40:31,359
What did you do with her?

861
00:40:31,443 --> 00:40:33,236
Hold up, Zee. She's with me.

862
00:40:33,361 --> 00:40:35,697
And that changes what exactly, Babs?

863
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:38,032
Whoa, easy! For once,

864
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:40,410
this girl's not with anybody.

865
00:40:40,493 --> 00:40:42,245
Even less reason to trust you.

866
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,705
Quit arguing!

867
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:45,331
We've got to find Bumblebee.

868
00:40:45,415 --> 00:40:46,541
[Bumblebee] I'm right here.

869
00:40:46,624 --> 00:40:48,251
I faked an emergency call.

870
00:40:48,334 --> 00:40:50,086
-Wait. What?
-[Zatanna] So not cool.

871
00:40:50,378 --> 00:40:52,630
Because we got to talk.

872
00:40:52,964 --> 00:40:53,882
Look.

873
00:40:53,965 --> 00:40:56,843
I know we have different ideas of what
being a superhero means,

874
00:40:56,926 --> 00:40:59,179
and honestly, that's what makes us...

875
00:40:59,637 --> 00:41:01,598
made us, such a good team.

876
00:41:02,932 --> 00:41:04,726
But what made us a great team

877
00:41:04,976 --> 00:41:06,019
is that we always agreed

878
00:41:06,102 --> 00:41:08,021
on the one thing a superhero isn't.

879
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:09,647
Selfish.

880
00:41:13,193 --> 00:41:15,695
We've been putting our own issues
ahead of the greater good.

881
00:41:16,154 --> 00:41:18,656
Whether it's a big shadow
only you can see,

882
00:41:18,907 --> 00:41:21,368
or questioning the virtue
of someone you love,

883
00:41:21,576 --> 00:41:23,870
or questioning the virtue in yourself.

884
00:41:24,496 --> 00:41:26,081
Or maybe you're just afraid

885
00:41:26,164 --> 00:41:28,041
to tell your friends
to be quiet and listen

886
00:41:28,166 --> 00:41:29,793
when they're making a huge mistake.

887
00:41:30,335 --> 00:41:32,670
Well, it's time to get over ourselves.

888
00:41:32,921 --> 00:41:34,881
So, be quiet and listen!

889
00:41:35,882 --> 00:41:37,509
The League may have made a big mistake

890
00:41:37,634 --> 00:41:39,302
by underestimating the Legion of Doom.

891
00:41:39,594 --> 00:41:41,888
But by claiming victory
without even considering us,

892
00:41:42,097 --> 00:41:43,973
the bad guys made
an even bigger mistake.

893
00:41:44,557 --> 00:41:47,477
They underestimated
the Super Hero Girls.

894
00:41:47,644 --> 00:41:49,312
Time to kick some Legion butt.

895
00:41:49,396 --> 00:41:50,438
[all] Yeah.

896
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:52,399
[Harley] A word of advice.

897
00:41:52,482 --> 00:41:54,526
If you're planning to storm
the Hall of Doom,

898
00:41:54,692 --> 00:41:55,944
bring hand towels.

899
00:41:56,194 --> 00:41:58,029
The restroom dryers are the pits!

900
00:41:58,571 --> 00:41:59,989
Wait. Harleen.

901
00:42:00,073 --> 00:42:01,241
You're not going to help?

902
00:42:01,408 --> 00:42:03,868
I said I didn't want
to destroy the world.

903
00:42:03,952 --> 00:42:06,246
Never said nothing about saving it.

904
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:08,748
[sighs] Forget her.

905
00:42:08,873 --> 00:42:09,958
We got work to do.

906
00:42:10,166 --> 00:42:11,960
First, we got to get our leader back.

907
00:42:12,085 --> 00:42:13,503
Now, just a minute.

908
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:15,171
She made a mistake, Kara.

909
00:42:15,255 --> 00:42:16,214
One mistake.

910
00:42:16,423 --> 00:42:18,717
How many of yours has she let slide?

911
00:42:20,301 --> 00:42:21,469
Let's go get her.

912
00:42:21,803 --> 00:42:24,139
But how? Isn't she in the Phantom Zone?

913
00:42:24,556 --> 00:42:25,432
Seriously?

914
00:42:25,515 --> 00:42:27,350
Have any of you been checking
your phones, at all?

915
00:42:27,434 --> 00:42:28,893
-We've had a lot going on.
-Lost my charger.

916
00:42:28,977 --> 00:42:30,729
Only to check the fashion month feed.

917
00:42:31,312 --> 00:42:32,147
[sighs]

918
00:42:35,066 --> 00:42:36,234
<i>My beloved sisters.</i>

919
00:42:36,776 --> 00:42:37,902
<i>I have wronged you.</i>

920
00:42:37,986 --> 00:42:40,321
I mean, it's cool she figured out
how to send a video,

921
00:42:40,405 --> 00:42:42,699
but you think she'd have realized
her thumb was covering the scree--

922
00:42:42,824 --> 00:42:44,200
Babs, listen.

923
00:42:44,826 --> 00:42:46,453
[sighs] <i>I know now,</i>

924
00:42:46,661 --> 00:42:48,163
<i>that in trying to protect you,</i>

925
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:50,415
<i>I only hurt you, deeply.</i>

926
00:42:54,502 --> 00:42:55,879
And because of this failure,

927
00:42:56,046 --> 00:42:58,757
I have humbly returned
to Themyscira, Mother.

928
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,051
There is a first for everything.

929
00:43:01,134 --> 00:43:03,803
You of all people know
this is not my first failure,

930
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:06,598
but it is my greatest.

931
00:43:06,681 --> 00:43:09,059
I was referring to your tears.

932
00:43:09,142 --> 00:43:12,187
I cannot recall
ever seeing you cry, my child.

933
00:43:12,312 --> 00:43:13,146
[Diana grunts]

934
00:43:13,605 --> 00:43:16,524
As your mother,
I did everything in my power

935
00:43:16,608 --> 00:43:19,194
to ensure failure never befall you.

936
00:43:19,319 --> 00:43:21,029
I know, Mother. Thank you.

937
00:43:21,112 --> 00:43:24,491
However, the one lesson I never taught

938
00:43:24,574 --> 00:43:26,576
was what to do when it does.

939
00:43:27,285 --> 00:43:28,953
We all fail, Diana.

940
00:43:29,329 --> 00:43:30,997
And that was my failure.

941
00:43:31,247 --> 00:43:33,917
One we will now rectify.

942
00:43:34,167 --> 00:43:35,043
We?

943
00:43:35,168 --> 00:43:38,421
Lucky for you, we're all really familiar
with screwing up.

944
00:43:38,671 --> 00:43:41,132
Yeah, we can give you the crash course.

945
00:43:41,299 --> 00:43:42,425
[all shouting]

946
00:43:44,677 --> 00:43:46,513
[sighs] We'll take it from here, Poly.

947
00:43:48,431 --> 00:43:49,349
Sisters.

948
00:43:49,432 --> 00:43:51,226
You are here. I thought you...

949
00:43:51,309 --> 00:43:52,227
Broke up?

950
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:53,269
We did.

951
00:43:53,353 --> 00:43:55,480
But Karen had a really inspiring speech.

952
00:43:55,605 --> 00:43:57,315
Ooh, do the speech thing again, Karen.

953
00:43:57,399 --> 00:43:59,609
It was more of an in-the-moment thing.

954
00:43:59,734 --> 00:44:01,820
But we did watch your thumb apology.

955
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:03,363
And thanks to Jess' ring,

956
00:44:03,488 --> 00:44:05,323
we got here a lot faster
than your row-boat.

957
00:44:05,573 --> 00:44:08,034
Now, come on.
There's no more time for hugs.

958
00:44:08,952 --> 00:44:11,121
Well, maybe one more.

959
00:44:11,204 --> 00:44:12,622
[all chuckling]

960
00:44:12,914 --> 00:44:14,249
All right. Diana,

961
00:44:14,416 --> 00:44:15,667
let's save the world.

962
00:44:15,834 --> 00:44:17,377
You still trust me to lead you?

963
00:44:17,961 --> 00:44:19,129
More than ever, D.

964
00:44:29,222 --> 00:44:30,640
With no other option,

965
00:44:30,932 --> 00:44:34,144
the United Council of Nations
cedes its power

966
00:44:34,352 --> 00:44:35,854
to the Legion of Doom.

967
00:44:35,979 --> 00:44:37,230
[all cheering]

968
00:44:39,399 --> 00:44:40,734
We make a good team.

969
00:44:40,817 --> 00:44:43,027
Not bad for a Kryptonian.

970
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:44,988
What?

971
00:44:45,071 --> 00:44:47,615
I think we're past any delusions

972
00:44:47,741 --> 00:44:51,619
of this being an actual partnership,
aren't we, Alexander?

973
00:44:51,995 --> 00:44:53,288
[sighs] What on earth are you...

974
00:44:53,371 --> 00:44:54,539
Stop talking.

975
00:44:57,751 --> 00:45:00,837
With my power near its peak,
it's time you assume the role

976
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,173
I'd always intended for you
and your Legion.

977
00:45:03,673 --> 00:45:04,883
Servitude.

978
00:45:05,508 --> 00:45:07,302
I await your command, Cythonna.

979
00:45:07,886 --> 00:45:09,220
Funny thing is,

980
00:45:09,387 --> 00:45:13,224
you've been serving me since the moment
you touched my amulet.

981
00:45:13,308 --> 00:45:17,437
You were just too blinded by your own
greed and ambition to realize it.

982
00:45:18,021 --> 00:45:18,855
So blind.

983
00:45:19,355 --> 00:45:20,732
What will you have me do?

984
00:45:21,024 --> 00:45:23,109
Ugh! I shall soon be free.

985
00:45:23,401 --> 00:45:25,612
I want to see my new Kryptonian body.

986
00:45:35,914 --> 00:45:37,290
What was that?

987
00:45:37,374 --> 00:45:38,291
The Kryptonian.

988
00:45:38,458 --> 00:45:39,376
Just like...

989
00:45:39,459 --> 00:45:40,377
I told you,

990
00:45:40,502 --> 00:45:43,421
I needed the world's
strongest Kryptonian.

991
00:45:43,505 --> 00:45:44,547
That was.

992
00:45:45,006 --> 00:45:46,925
Wait. You mean--

993
00:45:47,008 --> 00:45:50,178
Unlike that one,
Kara's strength is yet to peak.

994
00:45:50,303 --> 00:45:52,680
Her strong will alone
makes her far more suitable

995
00:45:52,764 --> 00:45:55,308
for divinity than this useless thing.

996
00:45:57,227 --> 00:45:58,061
Wait!

997
00:45:58,686 --> 00:46:00,355
He may not be completely useless.

998
00:46:04,234 --> 00:46:07,904
Our only chance is to catch the Legion
off guard with a surprise offensive.

999
00:46:07,987 --> 00:46:10,031
Like going by these schematics
Batman gave you,

1000
00:46:10,323 --> 00:46:11,908
I don't see any way to sneak in.

1001
00:46:12,033 --> 00:46:13,910
But maybe we could sneak out.

1002
00:46:18,915 --> 00:46:20,291
Hey, what gives? It's empty.

1003
00:46:20,375 --> 00:46:21,418
Sorry.

1004
00:46:21,501 --> 00:46:23,002
I downloaded the data
to figure out a way

1005
00:46:23,086 --> 00:46:25,130
to get to the Phantom Zone
and rescue our friends.

1006
00:46:25,296 --> 00:46:28,425
You mean, you think you can create
our own dimensional portal?

1007
00:46:28,508 --> 00:46:29,342
Exactly.

1008
00:46:29,592 --> 00:46:31,886
But now I'm thinking we can create
something even better.

1009
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:33,930
Whoa! A dimensional waterslide?

1010
00:46:34,139 --> 00:46:37,684
So, we know Cythonna's magic has
unlimited access to the Phantom Zone,

1011
00:46:37,851 --> 00:46:39,561
which makes the amulet like a hub.

1012
00:46:39,686 --> 00:46:40,687
Theoretically speaking,

1013
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:42,397
it correlates with what
quantum physicists call

1014
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,982
a Hamiltonian density matrix.

1015
00:46:44,232 --> 00:46:45,066
Here, look.

1016
00:46:45,233 --> 00:46:48,069
Bottom line, a way in is a way out.

1017
00:46:48,278 --> 00:46:50,155
Wait. I see what Karen's thinking.

1018
00:46:50,405 --> 00:46:52,615
You figure out a way to travel
to the Phantom Zone,

1019
00:46:52,699 --> 00:46:53,616
grab our friends,

1020
00:46:53,783 --> 00:46:55,493
but then come back through the amulet.

1021
00:46:55,577 --> 00:46:57,829
Which would put us smack-dab
in the middle of

1022
00:46:57,912 --> 00:46:59,330
the Hall of Doom.

1023
00:46:59,414 --> 00:47:01,875
With all of the heroes in full force.

1024
00:47:02,042 --> 00:47:03,877
Talk about a sneak attack.

1025
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,503
Do you really think you could do it?

1026
00:47:05,587 --> 00:47:07,714
No, but you can.

1027
00:47:07,797 --> 00:47:08,840
Uh, come again?

1028
00:47:08,923 --> 00:47:11,009
I can figure out how to navigate
through dimensions

1029
00:47:11,134 --> 00:47:12,177
but without the right tech,

1030
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:14,554
we have to travel the same way
Cythonna does.

1031
00:47:14,763 --> 00:47:15,930
With magic.

1032
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:18,975
Well, why didn't you say so?
I'm your girl.

1033
00:47:19,726 --> 00:47:21,394
[Bumblebee] Dark magic.

1034
00:47:21,644 --> 00:47:24,230
Oh, dark... [chuckles nervously]

1035
00:47:24,397 --> 00:47:26,941
Yeah, I mean, I guess.

1036
00:47:27,442 --> 00:47:28,693
[Cythonna whispering] <i>Kara.</i>

1037
00:47:29,277 --> 00:47:31,654
[Cythonna whispering] <i>Kara Zor-El.</i>

1038
00:47:32,197 --> 00:47:34,282
[Cythonna] Kara Zor-El of Krypton.

1039
00:47:41,956 --> 00:47:43,333
Cythonna.

1040
00:47:43,625 --> 00:47:46,711
I apologize if I interrupted you
and your friends

1041
00:47:46,836 --> 00:47:49,964
planning what promises to be
an adorable yet futile attack.

1042
00:47:50,298 --> 00:47:51,341
What do you want?

1043
00:47:51,966 --> 00:47:54,427
Simple. I want you to come get...

1044
00:47:54,969 --> 00:47:55,887
Him.

1045
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:57,055
Kal. No!

1046
00:47:57,138 --> 00:47:58,139
[Cythonna] Want him?

1047
00:47:58,723 --> 00:48:00,183
Come get him.

1048
00:48:01,101 --> 00:48:03,645
Goddess or not, I swear I will beat you.

1049
00:48:04,312 --> 00:48:05,814
Kara.

1050
00:48:05,897 --> 00:48:07,607
Kara, are you okay?

1051
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:09,776
Listen, Diana,
you go rescue our friends.

1052
00:48:10,193 --> 00:48:11,653
I need to face Cythonna.

1053
00:48:11,736 --> 00:48:13,988
What? Kara, I must insist--

1054
00:48:14,072 --> 00:48:16,449
I know. I know. You think
I'm being my bullheaded self,

1055
00:48:16,533 --> 00:48:18,410
and I am.

1056
00:48:18,493 --> 00:48:20,453
But they have Clark.

1057
00:48:20,537 --> 00:48:21,621
-Then we should--
-Diana,

1058
00:48:21,746 --> 00:48:25,041
I am asking you to trust me now.

1059
00:48:29,295 --> 00:48:30,755
[computer trilling, beeping]

1060
00:48:31,172 --> 00:48:33,007
[Bumblebee] Okay. I think
we're ready to go.

1061
00:48:34,342 --> 00:48:36,469
-Where's Kara?
-Supergirl will meet us there.

1062
00:48:37,011 --> 00:48:39,097
Trust she knows
what she's doing, sisters.

1063
00:48:39,222 --> 00:48:40,140
I do.

1064
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:41,725
Now, let us away.

1065
00:48:41,891 --> 00:48:44,936
All aboard The Phantom Zone Express.

1066
00:48:45,061 --> 00:48:46,020
Bubble us up, Jess.

1067
00:48:50,817 --> 00:48:52,610
Okay, Zee. Go time.

1068
00:48:52,694 --> 00:48:56,322
All right. Dark, creepy and often
uncontrollable magic coming up.

1069
00:48:56,406 --> 00:48:57,407
It's okay, Zee.

1070
00:48:57,490 --> 00:48:58,533
You got this.

1071
00:49:00,118 --> 00:49:01,619
[indistinct muttering]

1072
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:07,167
[all screaming]

1073
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,547
I never thought I would say this, but,

1074
00:49:12,714 --> 00:49:15,800
burritos for lunch was a horrible idea.

1075
00:49:15,884 --> 00:49:19,679
Zee, each off-shoot tunnel is a gateway
to a different dimension.

1076
00:49:19,804 --> 00:49:21,765
The Phantom Zone is coming up.

1077
00:49:21,848 --> 00:49:23,475
Now, make sure you...

1078
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,851
[Dark Zee] <i>You're gonna blow it.</i>

1079
00:49:24,976 --> 00:49:26,811
Stop it. Stop.

1080
00:49:27,145 --> 00:49:29,564
I can do this. I can.

1081
00:49:29,647 --> 00:49:31,316
You don't seem so sure of yourself.

1082
00:49:31,399 --> 00:49:32,817
How can you be sure of anything

1083
00:49:32,901 --> 00:49:34,235
when you're not even sure
of who you are?

1084
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:35,904
You're nothing. A nobody.

1085
00:49:35,987 --> 00:49:36,863
No one loves you.

1086
00:49:36,988 --> 00:49:38,323
-You are a freak.
-A phoney.

1087
00:49:38,406 --> 00:49:39,449
A monster.

1088
00:49:39,532 --> 00:49:41,201
No wonder your mom left.

1089
00:49:41,451 --> 00:49:42,660
[shouting] Stop it.

1090
00:49:43,912 --> 00:49:45,288
[all screaming]

1091
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,710
Did I do it?

1092
00:49:50,877 --> 00:49:53,797
I'm not sure, but I think so.

1093
00:49:54,589 --> 00:49:56,257
Sisters, at the ready.

1094
00:49:57,050 --> 00:49:59,803
Weird. Awfully bright
for a Phantom Zone.

1095
00:50:01,721 --> 00:50:04,891
Are we sure
we're in the right dimension?

1096
00:50:06,393 --> 00:50:07,894
No, I'm not sure.

1097
00:50:08,269 --> 00:50:09,687
The dark magic...

1098
00:50:09,896 --> 00:50:11,064
It's okay, Zee.

1099
00:50:11,314 --> 00:50:14,359
I mean, we don't know
that this isn't the Phantom Zone.

1100
00:50:14,734 --> 00:50:16,111
Yeah, of course it is.

1101
00:50:16,361 --> 00:50:18,446
Now, let's find the other heroes.

1102
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:20,240
Uh, I see heroes,

1103
00:50:20,573 --> 00:50:23,118
but I don't think they're the ones
we're looking for.

1104
00:50:24,828 --> 00:50:26,579
BB, you seeing what I'm seeing?

1105
00:50:28,039 --> 00:50:30,166
It's the Super Hero Girls, yo.

1106
00:50:33,294 --> 00:50:36,923
Oh, yes, the team
I wish to be the member of,

1107
00:50:37,006 --> 00:50:41,428
but refuse to say as such so as to spare
the feelings of my current team.

1108
00:50:46,015 --> 00:50:48,893
We actually have a door, but whatever.

1109
00:50:50,937 --> 00:50:53,940
Oh, come on.
This literally happened yesterday.

1110
00:50:54,023 --> 00:50:57,902
You mean, we've already been
crossed over and no one told us?

1111
00:50:58,361 --> 00:51:00,864
Well, the hits just keep on coming.

1112
00:51:01,531 --> 00:51:02,574
Just watch.

1113
00:51:02,949 --> 00:51:04,492
You'll play a very important role

1114
00:51:04,659 --> 00:51:05,827
in this story before its end.

1115
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:07,704
Trust me! [chuckles]

1116
00:51:08,913 --> 00:51:09,873
Hmm.

1117
00:51:09,956 --> 00:51:12,292
We apologize, but do we know you?

1118
00:51:12,625 --> 00:51:13,793
[laughs]

1119
00:51:14,002 --> 00:51:15,336
Good one, Wonder lady.

1120
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:17,255
I didn't realize you were the funny one.

1121
00:51:17,338 --> 00:51:19,215
It's like you're the 'me' of your team.

1122
00:51:19,299 --> 00:51:21,259
Come on, guys. It's us.

1123
00:51:21,342 --> 00:51:22,886
The Teen Titans.

1124
00:51:23,011 --> 00:51:24,637
You mean, the tween titans.

1125
00:51:25,013 --> 00:51:26,389
Didn't we babysit you once?

1126
00:51:26,598 --> 00:51:27,432
"Babysit"?

1127
00:51:28,224 --> 00:51:30,685
Do I in any way look like a baby to you?

1128
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:33,354
[Beast Boy] Oh, I gets it.

1129
00:51:33,563 --> 00:51:35,065
They are good enough for our show,

1130
00:51:35,148 --> 00:51:36,858
but the moments we shows up
in their thing,

1131
00:51:36,941 --> 00:51:38,693
it's all like, "What's going on?

1132
00:51:38,818 --> 00:51:39,819
Who's are you?"

1133
00:51:39,944 --> 00:51:40,904
Hey, that's right!

1134
00:51:40,987 --> 00:51:42,530
Continuity snobs.

1135
00:51:42,697 --> 00:51:44,991
Guys, I think I know what's going on.

1136
00:51:45,367 --> 00:51:48,328
We've ended up in some kind
of parallel universe.

1137
00:51:48,912 --> 00:51:50,747
One that's similar to ours.

1138
00:51:50,997 --> 00:51:53,333
But with way larger heads.

1139
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:54,876
And hands.

1140
00:51:54,959 --> 00:51:56,336
Our hands are very large too

1141
00:51:57,879 --> 00:51:59,381
So I guess I did mess up.

1142
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:04,094
As fellow heroes, you can appreciate
the gravity of our mission,

1143
00:52:04,177 --> 00:52:07,389
for we face a crisis
of catastrophic proportions.

1144
00:52:07,472 --> 00:52:09,349
[giggling]

1145
00:52:09,432 --> 00:52:11,559
Forgive us if we seem underwhelmed

1146
00:52:11,726 --> 00:52:14,354
but we eat crises of
catastrophic proportions

1147
00:52:14,521 --> 00:52:15,647
for breakfast.

1148
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:18,441
They're called jalapeno waffle bombs,
yo. Ha-ha!

1149
00:52:18,691 --> 00:52:21,194
Okay, Super Hero Girls, we'll help you.

1150
00:52:21,528 --> 00:52:23,738
Really, we just need a couple
of spare computer parts.

1151
00:52:23,822 --> 00:52:25,490
But I'm only saying this once.

1152
00:52:25,573 --> 00:52:27,367
My world. My rules.

1153
00:52:27,575 --> 00:52:28,827
I call the shots.

1154
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:30,787
I say jump, you say, "I already did

1155
00:52:30,912 --> 00:52:33,289
because I'm so in tune
with your amazing leadership skills,

1156
00:52:33,373 --> 00:52:35,625
I knew what you were going to ask me
before you could even ask it."

1157
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:37,794
[inhales deeply] Are we clear?

1158
00:52:38,211 --> 00:52:39,087
Oh, wow.

1159
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:40,964
Is it possible that
you're even more annoying

1160
00:52:41,131 --> 00:52:42,424
than the Robin in my universe?

1161
00:52:49,806 --> 00:52:50,890
I'm pretty sure I can fix it.

1162
00:52:50,974 --> 00:52:51,850
True. True.

1163
00:52:51,933 --> 00:52:53,184
But let me hit you with this.

1164
00:52:53,268 --> 00:52:55,729
Why fix when you can upgrade?

1165
00:52:55,812 --> 00:52:57,480
Because I only need to...

1166
00:52:57,564 --> 00:52:58,815
Picture it, other BB.

1167
00:52:58,898 --> 00:53:02,444
This baby, with its own ultra TK
mega library of video games.

1168
00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:04,195
A taquito warming drawer.

1169
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,280
Racing stripes.

1170
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:07,741
Why would a computer
need racing stripes?

1171
00:53:08,491 --> 00:53:10,827
A computer would not need
racing stripes.

1172
00:53:10,994 --> 00:53:13,747
But a remote control
funnel cake deep-fryer would.

1173
00:53:13,913 --> 00:53:14,873
No way.

1174
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:18,376
Any animal?

1175
00:53:18,543 --> 00:53:19,419
Mmm-hmm.

1176
00:53:19,586 --> 00:53:21,254
How about a fairy armadillo?

1177
00:53:22,672 --> 00:53:23,798
Oh, an aye-aye.

1178
00:53:23,882 --> 00:53:25,258
Aye. Aye.

1179
00:53:25,467 --> 00:53:26,301
Ooh!

1180
00:53:26,426 --> 00:53:27,385
A Chengdu yak.

1181
00:53:27,844 --> 00:53:30,096
Ooh! Does this mean
you have four stomachs?

1182
00:53:30,221 --> 00:53:31,056
I don't knows.

1183
00:53:31,264 --> 00:53:32,098
Let's find out.

1184
00:53:41,107 --> 00:53:41,941
[gasps]

1185
00:53:42,067 --> 00:53:42,901
[stomach rumbling]

1186
00:53:42,984 --> 00:53:44,611
[groans] That's not sitting right.

1187
00:53:44,778 --> 00:53:46,613
Ah, better.

1188
00:53:46,696 --> 00:53:47,530
Hold up!

1189
00:53:47,697 --> 00:53:48,615
[stomach rumbling]

1190
00:53:50,492 --> 00:53:51,326
[sighs in relief]

1191
00:53:51,409 --> 00:53:53,119
Uh-oh. Here comes number three.

1192
00:53:53,244 --> 00:53:54,245
[shrieking]

1193
00:53:54,537 --> 00:53:56,247
How is it getting worse each time?

1194
00:53:56,539 --> 00:53:57,374
[pants]

1195
00:53:57,457 --> 00:53:58,291
[sighs in relief]

1196
00:53:58,541 --> 00:53:59,376
[stomach rumbling]

1197
00:53:59,542 --> 00:54:00,460
Last one.

1198
00:54:01,044 --> 00:54:01,878
[groans]

1199
00:54:02,462 --> 00:54:03,546
[sighs in relief]

1200
00:54:04,130 --> 00:54:05,548
Four stomachs in the house.

1201
00:54:05,924 --> 00:54:06,758
[stomach rumbling]

1202
00:54:06,841 --> 00:54:09,010
I got to go to the little yak's room.

1203
00:54:11,721 --> 00:54:12,555
[shrieks]

1204
00:54:15,225 --> 00:54:16,559
Oh, hey, Starfire.

1205
00:54:17,185 --> 00:54:20,188
You guys sure do
things differently here.

1206
00:54:20,271 --> 00:54:22,941
I, too, was a comer
to the newness of this world

1207
00:54:23,024 --> 00:54:25,527
on a day that was
not long from this one.

1208
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:27,195
Bet that took getting used to.

1209
00:54:27,278 --> 00:54:29,447
Permit me to give the piece of advice?

1210
00:54:29,614 --> 00:54:30,824
Sure, let's hear it.

1211
00:54:31,241 --> 00:54:34,160
[whispering] Despite the deliciousness
of their appearance,

1212
00:54:34,452 --> 00:54:37,414
cats may not be ingested.

1213
00:54:40,583 --> 00:54:43,837
Oh. Uh, thank you, Starfire.

1214
00:54:44,087 --> 00:54:45,338
Good to know.

1215
00:54:46,756 --> 00:54:48,383
Yeah, my team would
pretty much follow me

1216
00:54:48,466 --> 00:54:49,509
to the end of the Earth.

1217
00:54:49,592 --> 00:54:50,635
I mean, it's not like

1218
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,679
being a better team leader
is a competition.

1219
00:54:52,762 --> 00:54:55,181
It's just, well, if it were,
I'd probably win.

1220
00:54:55,306 --> 00:54:56,808
And, if this mug is to be believed,

1221
00:54:56,891 --> 00:54:58,226
I already have.

1222
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:00,854
You bought that yourself, didn't you?

1223
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:02,689
[chuckles nervously] What? No!

1224
00:55:03,106 --> 00:55:06,985
Sheesh! Sounds like someone's got
a little mug envy.

1225
00:55:07,068 --> 00:55:08,570
Well, I have no mug,

1226
00:55:08,653 --> 00:55:10,780
nor any such boastful
beverage conveyance.

1227
00:55:10,864 --> 00:55:14,409
I do have a lasso that can compel anyone
to tell the truth.

1228
00:55:14,492 --> 00:55:15,618
Would you like to try it?

1229
00:55:16,244 --> 00:55:17,078
[mug breaking]

1230
00:55:17,203 --> 00:55:18,246
[high-pitched voice] I bought the mug.

1231
00:55:22,792 --> 00:55:24,544
You find them instantly
annoying too, huh?

1232
00:55:26,087 --> 00:55:26,921
[laughs softly]

1233
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:28,298
They're not so bad.

1234
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:32,635
We only have one bonehead on our team.

1235
00:55:33,011 --> 00:55:33,928
Me.

1236
00:55:34,054 --> 00:55:35,805
It's my fault we're stuck here.

1237
00:55:36,848 --> 00:55:37,849
Messed up a spell?

1238
00:55:37,932 --> 00:55:39,017
It happens.

1239
00:55:41,102 --> 00:55:42,145
It's more than a spell.

1240
00:55:43,063 --> 00:55:44,606
There's a part of me.

1241
00:55:44,814 --> 00:55:45,899
A dark part.

1242
00:55:46,483 --> 00:55:48,193
I've always been frightened of it.

1243
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:49,903
But, lately...

1244
00:55:51,279 --> 00:55:53,239
Never mind, it's complicated.

1245
00:55:54,866 --> 00:55:55,742
Yeah.

1246
00:55:55,909 --> 00:55:57,369
I wish there was some way
I could relate.

1247
00:55:57,911 --> 00:55:59,371
Oh, wait. I just remembered.

1248
00:55:59,621 --> 00:56:01,915
I am Raven, daughter of Trigon,

1249
00:56:02,082 --> 00:56:05,085
demonic overlord of all he surveys.

1250
00:56:09,881 --> 00:56:11,549
[both laugh]

1251
00:56:16,513 --> 00:56:17,806
Not bad, other BB.

1252
00:56:17,972 --> 00:56:20,225
-We did it.
-You were right.

1253
00:56:20,475 --> 00:56:22,394
The racing stripes are a nice touch.

1254
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:23,812
You two got the computer working?

1255
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:26,022
I just need to power
the external V-drive.

1256
00:56:26,231 --> 00:56:29,359
So we'll need a AAA battery,
like the one in a TV remote.

1257
00:56:33,321 --> 00:56:35,115
[exclaiming nervously]

1258
00:56:35,365 --> 00:56:37,158
Our universe doesn't have remotes.

1259
00:56:37,325 --> 00:56:38,827
Yeah, yeah.

1260
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:40,995
We's control TVs with our minds.

1261
00:56:41,413 --> 00:56:42,247
[button clicks]

1262
00:56:44,332 --> 00:56:46,918
Fear not. We will find a battery--

1263
00:56:47,001 --> 00:56:48,878
Oh, yeah. <i>Battleship Bake Off!</i>

1264
00:56:49,045 --> 00:56:51,798
So, did you have a battery, or no?

1265
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:54,718
Huh? Battery? Oh, yeah.

1266
00:56:54,801 --> 00:56:55,635
Help yourself.

1267
00:56:55,719 --> 00:56:57,095
I think I saw one in the garage.

1268
00:56:57,262 --> 00:56:59,097
Or did I see one in the foyer?

1269
00:56:59,347 --> 00:57:00,974
Ooh la-la. Fo-yay.

1270
00:57:01,141 --> 00:57:03,226
[laughs] He means fo-yur, yo.

1271
00:57:03,393 --> 00:57:05,228
Fo-yur? Where's your flair?

1272
00:57:05,311 --> 00:57:06,187
Your passion?

1273
00:57:06,312 --> 00:57:07,647
Get some culture, fool.

1274
00:57:07,772 --> 00:57:09,858
-It's pronounced fo-yur, bro.
-Nah-uh.

1275
00:57:09,941 --> 00:57:11,443
Fo-yay, all the way.

1276
00:57:11,526 --> 00:57:13,111
Of course, this building comes equipped

1277
00:57:13,194 --> 00:57:15,989
with neither the fo-yur, nor the fo-yay.

1278
00:57:16,281 --> 00:57:18,533
That's really not the point now,
is it, Starfire?

1279
00:57:18,616 --> 00:57:20,035
We do so have a foyer.

1280
00:57:20,118 --> 00:57:21,828
Wait. That's really more of a portico.

1281
00:57:21,911 --> 00:57:23,455
Do you have a battery or not?

1282
00:57:24,289 --> 00:57:25,623
Yes. You remind me of me.

1283
00:57:25,707 --> 00:57:27,375
Let's go find one.

1284
00:57:27,751 --> 00:57:28,585
[objects clattering]

1285
00:57:28,752 --> 00:57:31,337
Oh, oh, no, he did not.

1286
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:33,590
Right, let's go.

1287
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:38,553
So, Luthor,
what's the first order of business

1288
00:57:38,636 --> 00:57:41,139
as rulers of the world? [giggles]

1289
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:42,974
Luthor?

1290
00:57:44,642 --> 00:57:46,269
Uh, hello?

1291
00:57:46,352 --> 00:57:47,187
What's with him?

1292
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:48,229
[crashing]

1293
00:57:52,067 --> 00:57:53,151
Where is Superman?

1294
00:57:56,946 --> 00:57:58,698
Where is Superman?

1295
00:57:58,782 --> 00:57:59,908
[Giganta] Get her!

1296
00:58:01,951 --> 00:58:02,869
[Cythonna] That's enough, children.

1297
00:58:06,748 --> 00:58:08,375
Come, let's talk.

1298
00:58:11,878 --> 00:58:14,506
You've always believed in me, yes?

1299
00:58:14,589 --> 00:58:16,800
Let's just say I heard stories.

1300
00:58:16,883 --> 00:58:19,719
Then you know my essence
will soon be free,

1301
00:58:19,803 --> 00:58:23,681
and I shall require a strong,
new Kryptonian body.

1302
00:58:23,765 --> 00:58:26,893
Ain't happening.
Kal-El's coming with me.

1303
00:58:26,976 --> 00:58:31,731
Oh. And you wonder why others presume
Kal-El is superior to you,

1304
00:58:31,898 --> 00:58:34,692
when you yourself
make the same presumption.

1305
00:58:34,776 --> 00:58:37,946
Wait, you mean, you... you want me?

1306
00:58:38,446 --> 00:58:42,450
Well, I mean, I can't blame you.
I am pretty awesome.

1307
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:49,374
Join me, and together, we will show
the universe the true meaning of power.

1308
00:58:50,208 --> 00:58:52,752
Yeah, that's going to be a hard pass.

1309
00:58:52,961 --> 00:58:54,754
Oh, well, in that case...

1310
00:58:55,213 --> 00:58:58,466
[ominous music playing]

1311
00:58:58,633 --> 00:59:00,593
-Kal!
-Submit...

1312
00:59:01,177 --> 00:59:02,429
-or he dies.
-[gasps]

1313
00:59:03,722 --> 00:59:05,390
I'll give you
some time to think about it.

1314
00:59:05,557 --> 00:59:07,308
[screaming]

1315
00:59:07,559 --> 00:59:08,476
[thuds]

1316
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:10,603
No! You can't do this.

1317
00:59:10,729 --> 00:59:14,899
[sinister music playing]

1318
00:59:16,151 --> 00:59:18,153
It's not about
not having dark thoughts, Zee.

1319
00:59:18,236 --> 00:59:21,114
It's about embracing those thoughts
as part of who you are.

1320
00:59:21,406 --> 00:59:24,284
But what if I do embrace them,
and I lose control?

1321
00:59:24,743 --> 00:59:26,453
What if I hurt someone?

1322
00:59:26,536 --> 00:59:28,288
Hmm. You might be surprised

1323
00:59:28,371 --> 00:59:29,998
what darkness can do,
if you give it a chance.

1324
00:59:30,331 --> 00:59:31,958
Out of all the infinite universes,

1325
00:59:32,042 --> 00:59:34,210
your magic just happened
to bring you here,

1326
00:59:34,294 --> 00:59:36,755
where you got a brief and
narratively convenient pep-talk

1327
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,340
from someone who deals
with the exact same thing.

1328
00:59:42,177 --> 00:59:44,095
[creature roaring]

1329
00:59:46,347 --> 00:59:48,349
Yeesh! Who would've thunk
getting a little battery

1330
00:59:48,433 --> 00:59:49,851
would become such an epic hassle?

1331
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:52,187
Dude, we face way epic-er hassles

1332
00:59:52,270 --> 00:59:54,522
for much smaller stakes all the time.

1333
00:59:54,606 --> 00:59:55,523
It's kind of our thing.

1334
00:59:56,775 --> 00:59:59,235
[electronic whirring]

1335
00:59:59,319 --> 01:00:02,781
Back online and ready to go.
I just hope Zee's up to it.

1336
01:00:04,532 --> 01:00:07,077
Next up, Phantom Zone.

1337
01:00:07,911 --> 01:00:11,956
You know, you might want to bring
the big guns with you on this mission.

1338
01:00:13,166 --> 01:00:14,959
Are they fighting over a remote?

1339
01:00:15,043 --> 01:00:18,421
Come on, BB. I've seen this episode.
[grunts]

1340
01:00:20,548 --> 01:00:23,218
Er, we appreciate the offer, Boy Wonder.

1341
01:00:23,301 --> 01:00:24,594
But this is our fight.

1342
01:00:24,677 --> 01:00:25,720
No, I get it.

1343
01:00:25,887 --> 01:00:27,722
It's your big adventure.

1344
01:00:28,056 --> 01:00:29,891
Bringing us along would
only upstage you.

1345
01:00:30,475 --> 01:00:33,937
I guess this is goodbye.
Thank you, Raven.

1346
01:00:40,819 --> 01:00:42,153
Bye Cy.

1347
01:00:42,278 --> 01:00:43,905
Let me know how
<i>Battleship Bake Off</i> ends.

1348
01:00:44,072 --> 01:00:45,240
Peace, love and animals, yo!

1349
01:00:45,323 --> 01:00:46,700
Keep them racing stripes shiny.

1350
01:00:46,866 --> 01:00:48,118
Take me with you!

1351
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:52,414
So long! By the way,
our adventure was in theaters.

1352
01:00:55,917 --> 01:00:56,918
You okay, Zee?

1353
01:00:57,669 --> 01:00:59,129
Oh, I'm better than okay.

1354
01:00:59,546 --> 01:01:00,588
Whee!

1355
01:01:05,051 --> 01:01:07,637
[grunts] Kara, I told you to--

1356
01:01:07,846 --> 01:01:09,681
I know what you told me, Kal.

1357
01:01:09,806 --> 01:01:11,850
Just because you think
you're so much better than me

1358
01:01:11,933 --> 01:01:13,017
doesn't mean you can tell me--

1359
01:01:13,101 --> 01:01:16,062
I'm not better than you, Kara.
Not by a long shot.

1360
01:01:19,023 --> 01:01:21,985
Then why are you
always such a jerk to me?

1361
01:01:22,110 --> 01:01:23,945
I never told you this, but

1362
01:01:24,028 --> 01:01:26,698
when you first got here,
I was so excited.

1363
01:01:26,781 --> 01:01:29,993
I thought, finally someone else
who will understand

1364
01:01:30,076 --> 01:01:32,037
just how lonely it is to be...

1365
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:34,998
Super. You know,
saying it out loud just now...

1366
01:01:35,373 --> 01:01:38,293
Mm, it is kind of pretentious
to call ourselves that.

1367
01:01:38,376 --> 01:01:39,961
You're not lonely, Kara.

1368
01:01:40,045 --> 01:01:42,380
Look at your friends. They're family.

1369
01:01:42,464 --> 01:01:45,508
Then look at mine. Ugh, Batman? Really?

1370
01:01:45,592 --> 01:01:47,635
-Dude's got serious issues.
-Wait.

1371
01:01:47,969 --> 01:01:50,180
Are you jealous of my friends?

1372
01:01:50,263 --> 01:01:52,932
[sighs] I'm jealous of your strength.

1373
01:01:53,016 --> 01:01:56,227
Okay, I'm only going to say this because
you said something kind of nice, but,

1374
01:01:56,853 --> 01:02:00,148
Kal, you are way stronger than me.

1375
01:02:00,315 --> 01:02:02,067
Well, I am Superman.

1376
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:05,070
[groaning] But that's not what I mean.

1377
01:02:06,237 --> 01:02:08,073
I was born with super strength.

1378
01:02:08,239 --> 01:02:11,242
It was handed to me. But, you,

1379
01:02:11,326 --> 01:02:14,162
your strength, your true strength

1380
01:02:14,245 --> 01:02:17,874
of character, of conviction,
you earned that on your own.

1381
01:02:18,583 --> 01:02:20,794
Way before you got anywhere
near a yellow sun.

1382
01:02:22,379 --> 01:02:24,464
Now we know there's gotta be an answer.

1383
01:02:24,756 --> 01:02:27,258
You just gotta use those noggins
right there, man.

1384
01:02:27,342 --> 01:02:29,260
You gotta use them to grab that answer.

1385
01:02:30,178 --> 01:02:32,055
Seriously, man, nothing?

1386
01:02:32,263 --> 01:02:36,851
-Is it a bread box?
-Ding-ding-ding, you got it.

1387
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:39,938
Man, you're good, kid.
You are good. Whoo!

1388
01:02:40,897 --> 01:02:47,612
[instrumental music playing]

1389
01:02:48,405 --> 01:02:49,948
Anyone need a lift?

1390
01:02:50,615 --> 01:02:53,827
Any second, your master
shall be set free.

1391
01:02:54,411 --> 01:02:56,496
[electronic whirring]

1392
01:03:03,294 --> 01:03:05,630
Heroes! Take them down!

1393
01:03:11,052 --> 01:03:12,512
If I had my mace--

1394
01:03:13,012 --> 01:03:13,888
[grunts]

1395
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:18,601
Huh?

1396
01:03:19,269 --> 01:03:21,312
I shrunk it down to bring to you,

1397
01:03:21,396 --> 01:03:24,774
but totally forgot about it until
you said something. Sorry.

1398
01:03:24,899 --> 01:03:27,277
Oh, I missed you too.

1399
01:03:27,569 --> 01:03:28,778
Hey, Batman!

1400
01:03:30,113 --> 01:03:33,742
So, I know you know about the Joker,
but did you hear about me and Bane?

1401
01:03:36,870 --> 01:03:38,246
[muttering]

1402
01:03:38,329 --> 01:03:42,375
Oh, you did? Yeah? I beat him
pretty good. First try, too. Heh.

1403
01:03:42,459 --> 01:03:43,835
How'd you do against him
your first time?

1404
01:03:44,502 --> 01:03:45,378

[snarling]

1406
01:03:50,216 --> 01:03:53,511
I wish I had a clever remark
about you both being feline villains.

1407
01:04:01,519 --> 01:04:04,689
Looks as if you two
are ready for a cat nap.

1408
01:04:05,273 --> 01:04:06,357
Stick with what you know, Diana.

1409
01:04:06,441 --> 01:04:07,776
[grunting]

1410
01:04:11,321 --> 01:04:14,532
Oh, that the hardest Lantern can hit?

1411
01:04:14,699 --> 01:04:15,575
[Jon] No.

1412
01:04:18,078 --> 01:04:20,163
That is the hardest Lantern can hit.

1413
01:04:20,497 --> 01:04:22,665
Oh, now I get why they went with you.

1414
01:04:22,749 --> 01:04:23,708

1415
01:04:23,792 --> 01:04:27,337
[groaning] Grundy angry.

1416
01:04:29,964 --> 01:04:33,093
How many Lanterns are there?

1417
01:04:33,176 --> 01:04:35,428
Three. It's a big number, I know.

1418
01:04:35,512 --> 01:04:37,097
Keep trying, you'll get there.

1419
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:41,017
[straining]

1420
01:04:41,142 --> 01:04:43,686
These no hold Grundy.

1421
01:04:43,770 --> 01:04:45,563
Yeah, that's kind of the point.

1422
01:04:47,857 --> 01:04:50,568
Oh, and all without
even throwing a punch.

1423
01:04:50,652 --> 01:04:52,278
Ah, look at that!

1424
01:04:52,362 --> 01:04:55,281
Got you again. Totally feeling
deja vu right now.

1425
01:04:55,365 --> 01:04:56,991
[laughs] So am I.

1426
01:04:57,075 --> 01:04:58,034
[ominous music playing]

1427
01:04:58,118 --> 01:05:00,412
-Back off, slick!
-Huh? [grunts]

1428
01:05:00,495 --> 01:05:03,748
Throwing cheap shots
at this one's my job.

1429
01:05:04,666 --> 01:05:07,585
Oh, my gosh, you changed your mind.

1430
01:05:07,836 --> 01:05:11,089
Come on! You knew I was always
gonna come around.

1431
01:05:11,172 --> 01:05:14,008
I just wanted to make
one of those perfectly-timed

1432
01:05:14,092 --> 01:05:16,720
bad-guy-turns-good dramatic entrances.

1433
01:05:16,803 --> 01:05:17,971
How'd I do?

1434
01:05:18,138 --> 01:05:20,348
Oh, pretty good. Thanks.

1435
01:05:20,932 --> 01:05:23,393
Can you see what's happening?

1436
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:26,521
Kryptonite's messing
with my X-ray vision.

1437
01:05:26,688 --> 01:05:28,231
-Oh, no.
-What is it?

1438
01:05:29,691 --> 01:05:31,860
-She's free.
-Quick, Kara.

1439
01:05:32,068 --> 01:05:34,028
[grunting]

1440
01:05:34,779 --> 01:05:35,905
You gotta run.

1441
01:05:36,197 --> 01:05:37,365
She'll come for you.

1442
01:05:37,449 --> 01:05:39,826
[sighs] I'm not leaving you
like this, Kal.

1443
01:05:39,993 --> 01:05:41,953
Why do you have to be so bullheaded?

1444
01:05:42,037 --> 01:05:44,706
Yeah, yeah, I am bullheaded, aren't I?

1445
01:05:45,165 --> 01:05:46,958
Cythonna, I give up.

1446
01:05:47,792 --> 01:05:48,877
Do you hear me?

1447
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:51,004
Kara... [grunts] What are you doing?

1448
01:05:51,087 --> 01:05:52,047
[Supergirl] Sorry, Kal.

1449
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:53,423
I have no choice.

1450
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,300
It's your lucky day.

1451
01:05:55,550 --> 01:05:58,011
I give up to you, Cythonna.

1452
01:05:58,219 --> 01:05:59,763
I'm all yours.

1453
01:05:59,888 --> 01:06:02,390
[grunts] Kara! No!

1454
01:06:02,766 --> 01:06:05,018
[laughs wickedly]

1455
01:06:08,438 --> 01:06:09,314
Okay.

1456
01:06:09,606 --> 01:06:10,940
What exactly happened here?

1457
01:06:11,524 --> 01:06:15,320
[groans] Felt like evil overdrive.

1458
01:06:15,695 --> 01:06:17,197
Totally grody.

1459
01:06:17,489 --> 01:06:18,406
Ugh!

1460
01:06:21,159 --> 01:06:22,452
That's the last of 'em, Wonder Woman.

1461
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:25,038
Good work, Hal.
Any sign of Supergirl yet?

1462
01:06:25,121 --> 01:06:27,332
Nope. Not of her or Superman.

1463
01:06:27,749 --> 01:06:28,666
Come on, Kara,

1464
01:06:29,876 --> 01:06:31,127
[explosion]

1465
01:06:33,254 --> 01:06:34,255
Kara?

1466
01:06:37,509 --> 01:06:38,760
Kara is gone.

1467
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:41,805
I am Cythonna.

1468
01:06:43,431 --> 01:06:44,641
What do we do, Wonder Woman?

1469
01:06:55,026 --> 01:06:57,445
Hal, you and the others
get the Legion to safety.

1470
01:06:57,529 --> 01:06:58,530
We got Cythonna.

1471
01:06:58,613 --> 01:07:00,240
No way. She's too powerful.

1472
01:07:00,448 --> 01:07:02,492
Carter, they can handle it.

1473
01:07:02,909 --> 01:07:05,120
This is a job for the Super Hero Girls.

1474
01:07:05,245 --> 01:07:06,204
Mmm-hmm.

1475
01:07:10,875 --> 01:07:12,627
Okay, Dee, what's the plan?

1476
01:07:16,339 --> 01:07:17,799
We fight.

1477
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:22,053
I was so hoping you would say that.

[rock music playing]

1485
01:07:48,747 --> 01:07:53,251
A rather strange representation
of your inner mind, Kara Zor-El.

1486
01:07:53,793 --> 01:07:55,462
It's my happy place.

1487
01:07:55,545 --> 01:07:58,548
Means I still run things in here.

1488
01:07:58,631 --> 01:08:01,217
I knew I wouldn't stand a chance
against you in the real world,

1489
01:08:01,384 --> 01:08:02,635
but I figure now,

1490
01:08:02,719 --> 01:08:05,013
at least I have some
home-field advantage.

1491
01:08:06,014 --> 01:08:08,224
[laughs mischievously]

1492
01:08:09,059 --> 01:08:11,936
Wait, are you challenging me?

1493
01:08:12,437 --> 01:08:14,397
Yeah, something like that.

1502
01:08:37,379 --> 01:08:39,756
What do you mean,
in case I ever got out of line?

1503
01:08:40,131 --> 01:08:42,008
[sighs] Serious issues.

Seems even I underestimated you.

1507
01:08:50,892 --> 01:08:53,186

Wow. I remember when you would have
killed to be his sidekick.

1567

Well, I've got my own sidekick now.

Oh, no, you're the sidekick.

he's got his League buddies, right, Dee?

01:12:02,876 --> 01:12:05,712
Yes, while I agreed to be

01:12:28,526 --> 01:12:30,278
And we weren't even in it.

1584
01:12:30,361 --> 01:12:31,946
I am not understanding.

1585
01:12:32,030 --> 01:12:34,908
You said we had the role
that is big to play.

1586
01:12:34,991 --> 01:12:36,493
Keep watching.

1587
01:12:38,036 --> 01:12:39,954
You know, Zee, I've been meaning to ask.

1588
01:12:40,038 --> 01:12:42,374
Where did you send
that Cythonna crystal anyway?

1589
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:44,250
You know, since I've come
to terms with this

1590
01:12:44,334 --> 01:12:48,421
whole dark magic part of me,
I figured let it decide.

1591
01:12:49,172 --> 01:12:50,382
[all gasping]

1592
01:12:55,178 --> 01:12:57,764
[ominous music playing]

1593
01:13:03,478 --> 01:13:05,480
Now I know what you're up to,
Control Freak.

1594
01:13:05,730 --> 01:13:08,149
Or should I say, Cythonna!

1595
01:13:13,947 --> 01:13:15,490
[coughs]

1596
01:13:15,740 --> 01:13:18,326
Man, it's like a farago of B.O.,
barbecue corn chips

1597
01:13:18,410 --> 01:13:19,828
and rancid strawberry milk.

1598
01:13:20,912 --> 01:13:23,581
Cayenne and onion chips, thank you.

1599
01:13:23,665 --> 01:13:26,126
I knew something was up
when you complimented Robin.

1600
01:13:26,209 --> 01:13:27,502
Who does that?

1601
01:13:27,627 --> 01:13:29,587
But now you've shown your hand.

1602
01:13:29,671 --> 01:13:33,007
And for the record,
I was always on to you, Cythonna.

1603
01:13:33,133 --> 01:13:34,509
Even before Raven was, I'm sure.

1604
01:13:34,592 --> 01:13:38,096
But, I too was waiting for you
to show your hand.

1605
01:13:38,179 --> 01:13:39,139
Really?

1606
01:13:39,222 --> 01:13:41,182
What is my hand, Boy Wonder?

1607
01:13:41,975 --> 01:13:43,643
Well, [stuttering] I could tell you,

1608
01:13:43,727 --> 01:13:45,729
but I don't want to step
on Raven's toes.

1609
01:13:45,812 --> 01:13:47,147
She wants her crystal back.

1610
01:13:52,110 --> 01:13:53,695
That's right. It is mine.

1611
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:54,904
Now, give it to me!

1612
01:13:55,321 --> 01:13:56,573
Starfire, catch.

1613
01:13:57,490 --> 01:13:59,284
-Give what to you?
-Ah!

1614
01:13:59,367 --> 01:14:00,452
The crystal!

1615
01:14:02,412 --> 01:14:05,040
Oh, you mean the crystal
that was in the hand,

1616
01:14:05,123 --> 01:14:07,083
but is now no longer in the hand

1617
01:14:07,167 --> 01:14:08,501
because of the keeping of away.

1618
01:14:08,585 --> 01:14:10,378
[Cythonna] Give it! Give it.

1619
01:14:10,837 --> 01:14:13,214
Horrible, horrible children.
Give it to me.

1620
01:14:13,339 --> 01:14:15,008
I demand it. My crystal.

1621
01:14:15,091 --> 01:14:17,677
Give it to me, you horrible,
horrible children.

1622
01:14:17,761 --> 01:14:18,720
I will destroy you.

1623
01:14:18,803 --> 01:14:20,764
I will destroy this whole universe.

1624
01:14:21,014 --> 01:14:23,808
We told you, C-train,
we don't do epic threats.

1625
01:14:23,975 --> 01:14:25,894
Raven, send this fool somewhere
they give a snot.

1626
01:14:26,728 --> 01:14:28,354
...at once! I demand you.

1627
01:14:28,438 --> 01:14:30,023
Please! I need it.

1628
01:14:30,106 --> 01:14:31,733
[yells] No!

1629
01:14:34,569 --> 01:14:35,612
Now what's we gonna dos?

1630
01:14:35,695 --> 01:14:37,947
I means, the TV's crooked, yo.

1631
01:14:38,031 --> 01:14:39,949
Nuh-uh. I can't watch a crooked TV.

1632
01:14:40,033 --> 01:14:42,327
You know the strain
that's gonna put on my neck servos?

1633
01:14:43,119 --> 01:14:46,664
So, Raven, where did you send
our friend and her little crystal?

1634
01:14:46,915 --> 01:14:48,708
I don't know. Somewhere.

1635
01:14:51,961 --> 01:14:55,256
<i>Meanwhile, at the Hall of Justice...</i>

1636
01:14:57,258 --> 01:14:59,803
Great Scott, what is this?

1637
01:15:02,639 --> 01:15:04,891
According to the Justice League
computer,

1638
01:15:05,016 --> 01:15:06,976
it's from this crossover dimension.

1639
01:15:07,060 --> 01:15:08,603
Holy crossovers!

1640
01:15:08,686 --> 01:15:10,146
Does this mean the Super Friends

1641
01:15:10,230 --> 01:15:13,066
have to travel to this strange
dimension and return it?

1642
01:15:15,902 --> 01:15:17,821
[clamoring]

1643
01:15:28,623 --> 01:15:32,961
That is going to be a hard pass
from the Super Friends.

1644
01:15:36,256 --> 01:15:38,174
[theme music playing]
