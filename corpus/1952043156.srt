1
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:30,367
Dude, how much longer are
you going to play the fool?

2
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:32,500
I'm telling you,
she's a ripe, little melon,

3
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,700
just waiting to picking.
Look at her.

4
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,233
Look at her over there,

5
00:02:36,233 --> 00:02:39,600
all lonely at that lonely
little lemonade stand.

6
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,967
Swagger over there
and say, hey, babe!

7
00:02:41,967 --> 00:02:44,633
You, me, Saturday Night?
Prom? Be there.

8
00:02:44,633 --> 00:02:47,600
- Be square. Huh?
- Give it a rest.

9
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,733
All right, play it safe then.
Walk over there and say,

10
00:02:49,733 --> 00:02:52,933
hi, ah, Sandy, I was wondering
if you had a date for the prom?

11
00:02:52,933 --> 00:02:53,867
How hard can that be?

12
00:02:53,867 --> 00:02:56,267
You should talk.
You don't have a date.

13
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,333
Yeah, well, my periscope hasn't
settled on a target yet,

14
00:03:00,867 --> 00:03:04,467
but it's obvious yours has.

15
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:08,067
Asking a girl out is something
I have to ease into,

16
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,200
otherwise I'll scare her off.

17
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,333
Shoot, Stan. The only
one scared is you.

18
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,533
No. I'm not scared. I'm cautious.

19
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:16,500
There's a difference there.
Cautious is for people

20
00:03:17,033 --> 00:03:18,633
with weak bladders.
Stan, look at her.

21
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,700
The time is now. Okay?
You have to

22
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,433
claim that property now,
before some other sap will.

23
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:27,633
Maybe tomorrow. Okay?

24
00:03:27,633 --> 00:03:29,767
No! There's no more time.
The prom is in three days.

25
00:03:29,767 --> 00:03:32,433
Stan, look, the cards
are in your hand.

26
00:03:32,433 --> 00:03:36,700
The Joker is wild.
Bet it all, or fold, baby!

27
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,400
Oh! Hi. Can I help you?

28
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,500
Two hot dogs.
Everything on 'em.

29
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,567
Right.

30
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,633
- Hi, Sandy.
- Hi.

31
00:03:58,533 --> 00:04:03,267
- How's hot dog business?
- Oh, great. Great.

32
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,100
We're not too busy
right now though.

33
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,633
Yeah, I know. Me neither.
Ah, can I get a lemonade?

34
00:04:08,633 --> 00:04:09,700
Sure.

35
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,433
So, are you going to be
taking summer school?

36
00:04:13,867 --> 00:04:17,067
No, I'm taking the summer off.
There you go.

37
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:20,300
Thanks. How much do I owe you?
Do I owe you a buck?

38
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,767
- It's on the house.
- Thanks.

39
00:04:22,767 --> 00:04:24,367
Maybe I can get
a hot dog sometime.

40
00:04:24,367 --> 00:04:27,133
Oh yeah. Great. Yeah.
Do you want one right now?

41
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,200
- No. Ha, ha, no. Thanks.
- Okay... okay...

42
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,933
So, ah, are,
are you going to the--

43
00:04:37,933 --> 00:04:41,100
- Hi.
- One large lemonade. Lots of ice.

44
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:46,967
Sandy, prom? You and me,
Saturday Night? Good deal?

45
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:48,733
- SANDY: There you go.
- Oh, God.

46
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:50,867
Sandy, would you like
to go to the prom with me?

47
00:04:50,867 --> 00:04:53,733
- Saturday night?
- Stan.

48
00:04:53,733 --> 00:04:57,167
- What?
- What are you doing?

49
00:04:57,167 --> 00:05:02,900
Um... are you going to be going
to the prom by any chance?

50
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,580
- Nope.
- Nope?

51
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,467
That's cool.

52
00:05:10,467 --> 00:05:13,667
I'd love to go.

53
00:05:15,633 --> 00:05:19,033
So, ah, I guess I'll
see you around then?

54
00:05:19,033 --> 00:05:21,167
Yeah. I'll see you at school.

55
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:24,767
Yeah, school... school.
That's right.

56
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:26,833
That's right.
We go to school together.

57
00:05:41,567 --> 00:05:46,567
- Well. Has the eagle landed?
- Oh, yeah. It sure has.

58
00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:48,400
Cool.

59
00:05:49,467 --> 00:05:51,533
She's really going
to the prom with you?

60
00:05:51,533 --> 00:05:53,533
Well, she doesn't have
anyone else to go with.

61
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:54,533
Wow!

62
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,333
TV REPORTER: ...covered six
hundred forty-one million gap

63
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,933
in this year's budget.
The Los Angeles county

64
00:05:59,933 --> 00:06:03,667
board of supervisors set in
motion a plan of action

65
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:06,333
Thursday, that can result in
reductions in health services.

66
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,000
Now, back to the studio
with Brea Walker.

67
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,133
Mr. Vonn.

68
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:14,867
Ah, Mr. Vonn.
Please, please sit.

69
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,467
Thank you.
I'm a bit short on time.

70
00:06:16,467 --> 00:06:18,600
I think you'll find last nights
news cast very enlightening.

71
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,300
With us now, live, from Ucla,
is archaeology professor,

72
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,500
Dr. Rachel Richman.
Dr. Richman?

73
00:06:25,033 --> 00:06:27,233
- Can you hear us?
- Yes, Brea. I'm... I'm hear.

74
00:06:27,767 --> 00:06:30,767
Doctor, explain to us the
significance of the ancient ring.

75
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:35,667
The ancinet rings of power
were forged of solid gold.

76
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:42,467
As a pair, these rings have been
officially ruled as priceless.

77
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,133
One of the rings
has been missing

78
00:06:45,133 --> 00:06:47,400
for over eight hundred years.

79
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,067
However, it's counterpart
has been on display at

80
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:56,067
the L.A. county
art museum since 1963.

81
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:59,467
Until tonight,
that ring was stolen.

82
00:06:59,467 --> 00:07:01,600
WALKER: Police believe that the
theft was a solo operation,

83
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,733
which occurred earlier this evening.
No arrests have been made.

84
00:07:05,733 --> 00:07:09,767
You did very well, Mr. Vonn.
I'm very pleased.

85
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:11,367
Me, too.

86
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:19,600
Perhaps, you can be of
service to me again someday.

87
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:22,693
Perhaps.

88
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:28,800
- First, the ring.
- The ring?

89
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,900
Yes, the ring. Where is it?

90
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,767
You mean, this ring. Ha, ha, ha.

91
00:07:36,767 --> 00:07:40,800
It's not funny, Mr. Vonn.
Take it off.

92
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,833
Well, I would. But it doesn't
seem to want to come off.

93
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:46,967
Little bugger seems
to be stuck.

94
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:50,700
Mr. Vonn, take it off your finger...

95
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,433
or I'll have someone
take your finger off.

96
00:07:53,433 --> 00:07:56,633
I suggest you honor your
deal with Mr. Deriva.

97
00:07:56,633 --> 00:07:58,300
Well, I appreciate
your concern, Mr. Mosh,

98
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,833
but I've altered the deal.

99
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:04,433
You see, I'm going to keep
the ring and take your money.

100
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:08,267
I don't think so.
I do. Thank you, Mr. Deriva.

101
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,967
And this story, just in
to the CRN news center,

102
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:33,733
a powerful ring has been stolen
from Ucla art museum.

103
00:08:33,733 --> 00:08:36,300
Authorities have no leads
as to the whereabouts

104
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:40,033
of the ring at this time.

105
00:09:08,433 --> 00:09:11,567
Car 612. We have a 211 in
progress. Second street tunnel.

106
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:14,533
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- We came for the ring.

107
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:17,200
Ah, yes, Mr. Mosh. The ring.

108
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,367
Now, the ring doesn't seem
to want you, does it?

109
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,567
Aaaah! Get him!

110
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,567
Car 612.
I'm going to need back up.

111
00:09:50,033 --> 00:09:53,767
Mr. Mosh, please tell Victor,
if he continues to pester me,

112
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,700
I'll send for his soul!

113
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,867
GIRL IN CAR: The cops in coming.

114
00:10:05,033 --> 00:10:07,733
Have a nice evening, gentlemen.

115
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,500
Hey!

116
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:11,533
Officer needs assistance at the
corner of figueroa and second.

117
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:16,933
Suspect is heading...
east on second.

118
00:11:29,733 --> 00:11:31,867
He said he'd send the
devil for your soul,

119
00:11:31,867 --> 00:11:34,567
or something along those lines.

120
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,767
Kid's got a lot of nerve.

121
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:41,367
First he double-crosses me,
and now he treatens me.

122
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,467
That ring's supposed
to have powers.

123
00:11:43,467 --> 00:11:45,600
That ring is worth
a lot of money, stupid.

124
00:11:46,133 --> 00:11:48,733
He went through five of us like
we weren't even there.

125
00:11:49,267 --> 00:11:53,000
- He was wearing the ring.
- Give me a break, Mosh.

126
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,533
Let me tell you what kind
of power that ring has...

127
00:11:57,533 --> 00:12:01,367
5.5 million dollars.

128
00:12:01,367 --> 00:12:06,567
That's what I paid Raymond Vonn
in advance to steal it.

129
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,233
And that's why he's
holding out on me.

130
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:12,833
It has nothing to do with this
hocus-pocus voodoo nonsense.

131
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,100
- It's chinese!
- Yeah, well, whatever it is.

132
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,600
We'll find him again.
We'll find him.

133
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,933
You do that, Mosh.

134
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:26,200
Shit.

135
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,567
Hey, loser.

136
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:51,600
Why don't you just shut up?

137
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,467
What's your problem?

138
00:13:15,467 --> 00:13:18,433
Hey, loser... loser...

139
00:13:18,433 --> 00:13:22,167
Loser, Mom's looking for you.

140
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,100
Where have you been? I've been
looking everywhere for you.

141
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:51,700
I called Dr. Maxwell's,

142
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,967
but they said the police
has already been there.

143
00:13:55,967 --> 00:13:59,800
I know what you're thinking,
but you must let me explain.

144
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,767
They don't know what
happened. The police don't.

145
00:14:02,767 --> 00:14:05,433
The doctor's don't.
They weren't there.

146
00:14:05,433 --> 00:14:09,700
I was there. I know.
Everybody agrees on that,

147
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,900
but they won't believe me.
They won't understand.

148
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,100
They won't listen.
They won't let me go to trail.

149
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:22,333
They think... I'm crazy. Do you?

150
00:14:30,567 --> 00:14:36,300
- Yes, Charice, I do.
- No! No! No, no, no, no, no!

151
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,967
As God as my witness,
I will prove my sanity.

152
00:14:38,967 --> 00:14:43,633
I will prove it to you all!
I'll prove I'm not mad.

153

[ Begins Sobbing ]

154
00:14:48,533 --> 00:14:52,600
- Too much?
- A little.

155
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,733
It'll be there.

156
00:14:58,467 --> 00:15:02,733
So... did you get a date
for the prom yet?

157
00:15:03,267 --> 00:15:05,400
I told you, Mom.
I'm not going to the prom.

158
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,533
Honey, how can you say that?

159
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:12,567
This is a very special time
in your high school career.

160
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:15,233
Boy, I remember my first prom.

161
00:15:15,233 --> 00:15:17,633
It was one of the
highlights of my life.

162
00:15:17,633 --> 00:15:19,767
Now, that's scary.

163
00:15:19,767 --> 00:15:22,967
Look, there's a young girl
in my action class.

164
00:15:22,967 --> 00:15:28,833
Her name is Amulet.
She's nice, she's very pretty.

165
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:33,033
She's a wonderful actress.
She's a virgo.

166
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:35,700
- You'd be perfect together.
- No.

167
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,400
- Why not?

- No.

- You didn't ask her to prom?
- No.

258
00:22:46,467 --> 00:22:52,067
All right, let this be a lesson then.
Nobody asks my girl to prom.

259
00:22:52,067 --> 00:22:54,667
I'm not your girl, Leon.

Stan, you have so much potential,

277
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:05,767

you could be

00:24:08,633 --> 00:24:12,633

- Just think about what I said, Stan.

You know, I'm really
tired of driving you around.

283
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,867
- Why don't you just take a bus?
- Six weeks of karate,

284
00:24:45,867 --> 00:24:47,500
and you would think
that you'd be

285
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,933
able to at least lay
one punch in.

286
00:24:49,933 --> 00:24:51,700
What are you talking about?
There were five of them.

287
00:24:52,233 --> 00:24:54,867
- That's five to choose from.
- So!

288
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,733
Sinsei is right.
You lack what it takes.

289
00:24:59,733 --> 00:25:01,333
You understimate yourself,

290
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,733

your butt kicked like today.

simple to understand.

Okay. I want an
explanation, old man.

315

The best explanation
for all things... is time.

What? Now,
what's that supposed to mean?

317
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,700
Okay, okay. Wake up Stan.
Just wake up.

Oh, great.

But, I did.

for every question.

You will learn them only
in their... due time.

For now, my body grows
tired for the last time.

325
00:35:14,733 --> 00:35:18,067
Give, give me your hand.

326
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:24,433
Boy! Please!
Give me your hand.

327
00:35:55,667 --> 00:35:59,933
The ring is not
the source of power.

328
00:35:59,933 --> 00:36:06,500
It is... but a doorway
to the Power Within you.

Wait!

330
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:19,300
Hold on! Just stay with me.

get you to a doctor.

No.

No.

All righty, sit down.

Dryer, stay up.

506
00:51:08,467 --> 00:51:10,067
Johnson, I want you to be
very, very careful with Dryer,

507
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,433
he's only a green belt,
you understand?

508
00:51:12,433 --> 00:51:15,367
You're a black belt.
Ready? Bow here.

509
00:51:15,367 --> 00:51:20,000
Bow to each other.
Ready, set.

510
00:51:31,867 --> 00:51:33,467
Careful, guys.

511
00:51:53,767 --> 00:51:55,900
Easy.

512
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:02,233
DON: Sensei, let me speak
with Dryer for a minute.

513
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,267
You did great.

514
00:52:10,267 --> 00:52:11,900
Your technique and strategy
was right on the money.

515
00:52:12,433 --> 00:52:14,500
You also seem pretty
sure of yourself,

516
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,233
- Set.
- all of a sudden,

517
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:19,300
I have all of this
power and confidence.

518
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:21,367
I mean, you saw me
beat up that black belt.

519
00:52:21,367 --> 00:52:24,867
Yes, I did.
But that was the easy part.

520
00:52:24,867 --> 00:52:26,467
What do you mean?

521
00:52:26,467 --> 00:52:28,600
Marital Arts has more to
do with mental toughness

522
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:32,033
and more responsibility, than
just beating up black belts.

523
00:52:32,033 --> 00:52:33,633
Ha, ha, ha.
What are you talking about?

524
00:52:34,167 --> 00:52:36,567
You had a whole career
of beating up people.

525
00:52:36,567 --> 00:52:39,233
No, I didn't.
That was kickboxing.

526
00:52:39,233 --> 00:52:40,833
It was just a sport.

527
00:52:40,833 --> 00:52:44,733
I had the utmost
respect for my opponments.

528
00:52:44,733 --> 00:52:46,433
It's true, you're good,

529
00:52:46,433 --> 00:52:49,633
and someday you might be
a champion yourself.

530
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:52,767
But remember there's a
responsibility that comes

531
00:52:52,767 --> 00:52:55,967
with your abilities,
and it's the proper

532
00:52:55,967 --> 00:52:59,333
use of power that's important.

533
00:53:19,033 --> 00:53:21,167
Dude, are you on, like,
on steroids, or something?

534
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:22,233
What?

535
00:53:22,767 --> 00:53:24,867
Well, you kicked Leon's
booty in class today,

536
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:28,033
and that's not like you.

537
00:53:28,033 --> 00:53:29,633
Nah, I've just been
working out. That's all.

538
00:53:29,633 --> 00:53:32,900
What was that Einstein
stuff in class today, huh?

539
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:38,233
- I've been studying.
- No, no, no, I don't buy it.

haven't you? Yeah, you have.

542
00:53:42,233 --> 00:53:43,833
You can tell me.
It's okay, I'm your buddy.

543
00:53:43,833 --> 00:53:45,967
I was reading about
it in the enquirer.

544
00:53:45,967 --> 00:53:51,167
- Excuse me, Stan?
- Sandy, hi, how are you?

545
00:53:51,167 --> 00:53:55,067
- Can I talk to you a minute?
- Oh, yeah. Sure.

546
00:53:58,667 --> 00:54:02,900
What? Oh, I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

547
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:07,600
I was thinking about
what you asked me today,

548
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,867
- you know, about prom.
- Yeah?

549
00:54:10,867 --> 00:54:14,400
- Yeah.
- And?

550
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,367
- Yes.
- Yes?

551
00:54:17,367 --> 00:54:18,300
- Yes.
- Really?

552
00:54:18,833 --> 00:54:23,133
- Really.
- Oh, that's... that's great!

553
00:54:23,667 --> 00:54:25,267
So, what are you
doing right now?

554
00:54:25,267 --> 00:54:26,133
Right now?

555
00:54:26,667 --> 00:54:28,267
I was thinking if
you're not doing anything,

556
00:54:28,267 --> 00:54:31,500
then maybe we could
do something.

557
00:54:32,033 --> 00:54:35,233
Um, actually right now,
I'm not doing anything at all.

558
00:54:35,767 --> 00:54:39,100
Ah, Eric, you said that you
could handle things alone?

559
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,867
- Alone, me?
- Yeah.

00:54:41,867 --> 00:54:46,433
Oh, yeah! Oh!
hey, you two kids go!
