Hey, heads up for cops!

173

[grunts] You little shit!

175
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,263
Don't you ever step foot
in my house again!

176
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:36,125
- [cop 1] Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir, enough!
- I don't wanna see you again!

177
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,728
- [cop 1] Enough! We got it!
- Don't set foot again in my house!

178
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:41,666
You taint the family name!
You're a disgrace to the Keïtas!

179
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,309
- [Agna] Don't! Stop it! That's enough!
- Come here! Good riddance!

180
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,708
Enough! Stop it!

181
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,750
This is all your fault!
You're too weak with him.

182
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:48,833
[cop 1] Come on now.

183
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:52,125
That's right! You're no longer my son!

184
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,208
Get out of here!

You can't even drive! Don't touch me.

I can help you guys.

Really? Tell me.

Can you help Adama get his sight back?

222
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,708
There's nothing we can do
about the apartment.

223
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,083
It's too small.

224
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,166
Too cluttered.

225
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,125
We need more space.

226
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:55,250
So the boy doesn't bump into things
while adapting.

227
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,625
We all must contribute,

Plenty of rooms.
It can fit the entire family.

an apartment so quickly, huh?

You really think
I'm gonna live in an apartment

235
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,875
that you paid for
with your dirty money? Huh?

236
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,583
I have to take care of my family, not you.

237
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:24,833
You know what?

238
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,708
Come talk to me when you're an honest man.

239
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,333
A real man.

240
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,250
Until then...

And what room is going to be Adama's?

247
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,750
Right next to yours.

248
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:10,125
From his room, you can see my tower.

249
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:11,916
When will he arrive?

250
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:15,125
Pretty soon.

in your room, hmm?

- [Ibrahim] No, no, no. It's fine, Mom.

256
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,333
You've gone through a lot.

- We don't always have to surrender.
- [Agna] Hmm.

You need to stop protecting him.

Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine, my boy. I'm fine.

Will you go?

Don't have much of a choice, do I?

If I don't, he'll go to my house
where there's my mom, my sister...

No fuckin' way.

00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,625
- [door shuts]
- [Ibrahim] Shut the fuck up!

344
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,333
Who do you think you are
putting your hands on my sister?

345
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,958
She's a queen, and you're a bum!
That's right, I said it. A bum!

346
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:31,101
- [man] Ibra, I didn't touch your sister.
- [Ibrahim] Shut up! Don't lie to me!

347
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:34,875
I swear, I will end you!
Don't you ever go near her again!

348
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,583
Get him out of here before I pop him.

349
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:37,666
[loud thud]

350
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:39,583
[door opens]

351
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,208
- [woman] Sweet boy, what is happening?
- Shh.

352
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,083
- Sorry.
- [loud thud]

353
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,458
- [Ibrahim] You're fucking dead! Dead!
- [man grunts]

354
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,833
- Get up, get up!
- Go ahead. Kill him, kill him!

355
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,916
Do you understand the words
coming out of my mouth?

356
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,750
I have eyes and ears
all over these streets.

357
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:02,541
If you come anywhere near her,
I'll end you, you bitch! Huh?

358
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,958
Yeah, you bitch.
You understand what I'm saying?

359
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,000
You better.
On my mom's life, I'll kill you.

360
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,123
You little shit,
you like touching people's sisters?

361
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,250
Try to play with me!

362
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:13,166
[Adama gasps, breathes shakily]

363
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,250
[Ibrahim] Get up!

364
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,291
[loud thud]

365
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:18,875
He's left.

366
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,625
Malik. They released him.

367
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,125
[Adama breathes shakily]

368
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,916
I can't take this anymore. I...

369
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,375
They make things unlivable around here.

370
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:30,500
Look at how they constantly stop
the elevator to do their dealing.

371
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,541
[Adama] It'll be fine, Mrs. Diop.

372
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,166
It'll be fine.

373
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,041
[somber music playing]

374
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,125
[Mrs. Diop breathing shakily]

375
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:45,291
[indistinct chatter]

376
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,208
[upbeat music playing]

377
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:59,666
[melodic drums beating]

378
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,250
[Adama's mom] Adama.

379
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,333
[dog groans]

380
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:10,541
Hey.

381
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:12,708
- Someone's here for you.
- Who?

382
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:14,916
[chuckles]

383
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,750
Come on, time to tell him
that beat-up old t-shirt has to go.

384
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,125
Poor guy can't see it.

385
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:22,083
Hey, hey, easy. Lay off that T-shirt.

386
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,500
It used to be mine.

387
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,833
- Ah, I see.
- [chuckles]

388
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,250
My gosh, what a nice shirt.

389
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,250
- Really lovely.
- [all chuckle]

390
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,625
You damn suck-up!

391
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:34,291
You have no shame!
The t-shirt's just fine.

392
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:37,291
All right, kids,
I'm headed back to the restaurant.

393
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,500
- See you later.
- Okay, good luck.

394
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,416
- [Aïssata] Bye, Dad.
- [Ousmane] Bye.

395
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,226
- [Adama's mom] You're so pretty.
- Thank you.

396
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,125
- [Adama] How you doing?
- [Aïssata] Good, you? [exhales]

397
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,208
Just fine.

398
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,000
Getting some work done.

399
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,083
[Aïssata] Hmm.

400
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,333
[sucks teeth]

401
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,416
Do you know where he is?

402
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,291
[Adama] Who?

403
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,375
Who do you think?

404
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:01,125
Don't know.

405
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:07,875
[sighs]

406
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,791
I've been calling him the last two days.
It goes to voicemail.

407
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:23,916
Son of a bitch is ghosting me.
I tried everything. IG, SnapChat.

408
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,833
I just hope nothing happened to him.

409
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:30,552
Because if he's ghosting me
for some other bitch, she's gonna be hurt.

410
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:33,041
[chuckles]

411
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,208
Something funny?

412
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:36,875
Not a thing.

413
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,333
Not a thing, Aïssata.
I'd never dream of it.

414
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,250
You're the baddest thug on the block.

415
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:42,833
I don't mess.

416
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:43,916
[chuckles]

417
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:46,250
Whatever.

418
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,125
Let me hear the track.

419
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,916
- Okay. This one?
- Yeah.

420
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:51,916
Here he is.

421
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:53,791
Your man's right here.

422
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,541
- [upbeat music continues playing]
- [Ousmane panting]

423
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,083
[exhales]

424
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:23,208
[coughing]

425
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,666
[music continues]

426
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:27,833
[chuckles]

427
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,750
[groans]

428
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,666
[breathing heavily]

429
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:38,666
[wheezing]

430
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:41,791
You like it?

431
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:42,666
I love it!

432
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,041
[both chuckle]

433
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:45,625
Ah! Ay!

434
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,208
My man's got the magic, right?

435
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,833
[music stops]

436
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:57,791
If it weren't for my magic, not his BS,
you wouldn't say that.

437
00:21:58,458 --> 00:21:59,375
Are you jealous?

438
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:00,541
Yeah, you bet I am.

439
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,416
Come on, don't even. You're the best.

440
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,291
[chuckles] There. That's more like it.

441
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,833
I'm being serious, though.

442
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:08,000
He's never done this.

443
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:09,625
We talk, like, ten times a day.

444
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:11,791
[sighs]

445
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,625
- You won't repeat this.
- Repeat what?

446
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:16,833
Swear!

447
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,583
- It's between us.
- Mm-hmm.

448
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:21,125
Let's hear it.

449
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:23,166
[exhales]

450
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,041
I was at Mrs. Diop's.

451
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:29,666
I heard Ibra and his guys beating him up.

452
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,500
And threatening to kill him
if he saw you again.

453
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:33,458
Damn it.

454
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:34,541
See now?

455
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:37,458
I've already told you,
do whatever you want,

456
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:38,958
but not in front of others.

457
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:40,641
Who cares about what other people think?

458
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:42,866
You can't just... blah, blah.
Where do you think we are?

459
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,291
[metallic noise echoing in the distance]

460
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:50,666
What is it?

461
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:52,541
You don't hear that?

462
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:55,500
- [dog whimpers]
- No.

463
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:59,208
- I heard a weird noise.
- [dog whimpers]

464
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:01,083
Come with me. Quick.

465
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:03,541

- [Ousmane gasping]

[clanks continue]

470
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,500
It's Dad!

471
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:24,958
It's Dad!

472
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,833
[Aïssata] Papa!

473
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:28,083
We have to call someone!

474
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:29,000
Papa!

475
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:30,916
Help! Help! Papa!

476
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,291
- Papa, please! I'm begging you!
- What's wrong?

477
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:35,559
- What's wrong with him?
- We have to call someone! Help!

478
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:37,000
Somebody help!

479
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,517
- Please, call someone!
- Please help!

480
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:40,875
Papa, please stay with me, please!

481
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:42,666
Papa, please!

482
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,958
- Papa!
- [echoing] Help!

483
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:55,625
[somber music playing]

484
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:19,041
[somber music continues]

485
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:15,416
[imam praying in Arabic]

486
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,291
[all pray in Arabic]

487
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,750
[breathing shakily]

488
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:28,000
[woman 1 muffled] She's right.
This place should be yours.

489
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:32,416
You started it with your husband.
Your sweat and tears.

490
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,250
[woman 2] I can't believe he left
the restaurant to both of you.

491
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,833
[woman 1] I mean, seriously...

492
00:25:36,916 --> 00:25:38,625
She hasn't done a thing.

493
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:41,541
Ousmane already got her that apartment.

494
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:44,166
Now she also inherits this?

495
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,583
What about Ibrahim?

496
00:25:46,666 --> 00:25:47,875
What does he get?

497
00:25:47,958 --> 00:25:49,000
Nothing?

498
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:51,041
Sorry, but that's not right.

499
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:54,041
Even if they weren't speaking,

500
00:25:54,625 --> 00:25:56,291
you can't do that to a son.

501
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:00,666
Don't take this lying down.

502
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,208
Now he's no longer with us.
You have to keep a low profile, son.

503
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:14,250
Even more so than before.

504
00:26:17,583 --> 00:26:18,916
[Aïssata] Malik, wait!

505
00:26:19,666 --> 00:26:21,583
- What is that?
- Nothing.

506
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:24,166
- What do you mean "nothing"?
- It's nothing, relax. Not here.

507
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:28,125
I'm sick of not seeing you anymore.
I'm gonna talk to him. I don't care.

508
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:29,208
To who?

509
00:26:29,291 --> 00:26:30,833
- To Ibrahim.
- No.

510
00:26:30,916 --> 00:26:32,556
No, no, no. You won't talk to him at all.

511
00:26:32,583 --> 00:26:34,250
Hey, this stays under wraps.

512
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:36,791
Wait till this blows over.
There's no other choice.

513
00:26:37,541 --> 00:26:39,875
I swear, I saw it in his eyes.
He really wanted to kill me.

514
00:26:41,916 --> 00:26:43,583
He wasn't always like this.

515
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:47,125
He doesn't know how else to do it.
It's how he protects us.

516
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:49,791
With time, he'll learn to accept you.

517
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:52,875
I can't.

518
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:54,791
I can't. You wouldn't get it.

519
00:26:55,375 --> 00:26:56,375
For real?

520
00:26:59,375 --> 00:27:02,541

- [dramatic swell]
- Adama.

523
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,708
Only you can save us.

524
00:27:20,791 --> 00:27:22,875
Come visit me when you're ready.

525
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,375
I can help you, Adama.

526
00:27:26,416 --> 00:27:27,791
I can help you.

527
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:30,875
We're closing.

528
00:27:33,791 --> 00:27:35,708
Hey, bro, are you blind or deaf?

529
00:27:36,708 --> 00:27:37,875
What are you doing?

530
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:38,958
He won't listen to me.

531
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,500
Leave him alone.

532
00:27:40,541 --> 00:27:43,250
We gotta talk about Eddy.
It's more urgent. Go ahead.

533

Keep your hands behind your head.

538
00:28:11,291 --> 00:28:13,976

- [robber 1] Shut the fuck up!

539
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,208

00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:28,416
What's all this about?

543
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:32,583
What's wrong?

544
00:28:35,208 --> 00:28:37,500
Put it all over there, to the left.
In the bedroom.

545
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:40,333
What's this all mean?

546
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:41,833
[bag thuds]

547
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:43,708
Ibrahim, what's going on?

548
00:28:43,791 --> 00:28:45,833
[Ibrahim] I have to stash
some things here for now.

549
00:28:48,583 --> 00:28:51,083
We're at war with Eddy
and the guys from his block.

550
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:53,517
- It's heating up the neighborhood.
- That's not my business.

551
00:28:53,541 --> 00:28:55,875
- What did you say?
- I'm the one you're putting in danger!

552
00:28:55,958 --> 00:28:58,833
- [Ibrahim] What was that?
- Why don't you take it to your place?

553
00:28:58,916 --> 00:29:02,125
If the cops search mine, I'm through!
They won't mess with the old and blind.

554
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:03,833
Plus, this is my place too.

555
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:06,250
I don't care what his will says!

556
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:08,208
I want to stash shit here, so I will!

557
00:29:08,291 --> 00:29:11,458
Whether Dad likes it or not,
this place is half mine. Period.

558
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:12,541
Got it?

559

[Adama breathing heavily]

560
00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:20,125
I won't abandon you and your mom.

561
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:24,583
I'll take care of you now that he's gone,
but we'll do things my way.

[money thuds]

563

Stand back! Stand back, I said!

589

Stand back!

590
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:48,125
Nothing to see here!

591
00:30:49,041 --> 00:30:50,416
Hey, what's the matter?

592
00:30:51,041 --> 00:30:52,166
What's goin' on?

593
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,500
[man] Get fucked! Fuck off!

594
00:30:53,583 --> 00:30:54,708
We're doing our job!

595
00:30:55,291 --> 00:30:56,916
- What'd he do?
- [cop 1] We got a call.

596
00:30:57,666 --> 00:30:59,346
People saw one of Eddy's guys get held up.

597
00:30:59,416 --> 00:31:00,625
Tom, what's your side?

598
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:02,559
[Tom] I didn't do nothing.
It was the other son of a bitch.

599
00:31:02,583 --> 00:31:03,983
[cop 1] Hey! Hey! Shut the fuck up.

600
00:31:04,041 --> 00:31:06,416
You better show some respect.
Show some respect!

[exhales]

602
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:11,291
Why did your guy book it
as soon as he saw us?

603
00:31:11,375 --> 00:31:12,416
Search him here.

604
00:31:13,541 --> 00:31:15,601
It's not up to you to tell me
how to search somebody.

605
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:17,225
If he held someone up, he'll have a gun.

606
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:18,541
Search for it.

607
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:19,666
If you find something...

608
00:31:20,666 --> 00:31:22,708
you have my word,
you can cart him off, no protest.

609
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,583
But cart him off without searching him,
without proof of your claims,

610
00:31:26,666 --> 00:31:28,746
I'll start a riot here
like you've never seen before.

612

[cop 2] Nothing else.

614
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
- Oh fuck.
- [Ibrahim] Get the fuck out of here.

615
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:01,416
Fuck off.

"Send people your resume."

636
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,708
[laughs] She said that, bro.

637
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:17,000
That boy, your cousin,
he's out of his mind, I swear.

638
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:18,000
That girl said...

639

Hmm?

I don't like what I'm hearing.

644
00:34:29,916 --> 00:34:31,708
I'm protecting these projects.

645
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,458
Everyone has to contribute.

646
00:34:33,541 --> 00:34:35,916
You protect your interests,
not these projects.

647
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,416
I'm not stupid, Ibrahim.

648
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,666
Hey, old head.

649
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:41,750
Don't come here and lecture me.
I'm not ten anymore.

650
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:48,416
Ibrahim, stop telling yourself
you grew up without love.

651
00:34:48,916 --> 00:34:50,500
Your dad loved you.

00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:28,375
[Adama's mom] They stole everything.

670
00:36:28,458 --> 00:36:30,666

00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:37,375
It's what my mom thinks.

What do you want, pal?

719
00:42:30,458 --> 00:42:31,458
Hmm?

720
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,125
This has gotten out of control.

721
00:42:38,208 --> 00:42:40,041
You don't know what he's capable of.

722
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:41,958
No.

723
00:42:44,416 --> 00:42:45,875
But I can do much worse.

724
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:51,041
Your war's wearing on everyone.

725
00:42:53,166 --> 00:42:55,166
The old and the young suffer most.

726
00:42:59,125 --> 00:43:00,541
Please give his stash back.

[laughs]

728
00:43:07,583 --> 00:43:08,916

Where do you think you are?

- [Adama sighs]
- Business is business.

733
00:43:19,208 --> 00:43:20,928
I took back what belonged to me,
that's all.

734
00:43:21,458 --> 00:43:22,916
I'm not giving anything back.

735
00:43:24,083 --> 00:43:27,458
I can tell you're a good kid.
Head back home before things go wrong.

736
00:43:28,208 --> 00:43:29,208
Take him home.

737
00:43:32,166 --> 00:43:33,833
- [man] Let's go.
- Don't touch me.

738
00:43:33,916 --> 00:43:34,916
Go home!

739
00:43:37,416 --> 00:43:38,791

- Stop!
- Get over here!

748

Nothing! I wasn't doing anything!

[grunts, coughs]

759
00:44:42,333 --> 00:44:43,458
Our stash is gone.

760
00:44:43,541 --> 00:44:46,416
You were at Eddy's hood,
but you weren't doing anything?

761
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,208
Tomtom saw you leave.
What were you doing there?

[Adama gulps]

Trying to get the stash back.

764
00:44:53,625 --> 00:44:54,875
To fix the situation.

765
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:55,875
I swear to God.

Don't feel like talking? Come here!

771
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:07,625
He needs to talk.

772
00:45:07,708 --> 00:45:08,583
Or we're dead.

773
00:45:08,666 --> 00:45:10,625
He needs to be able to talk, then.

774
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,166
Chill, I have another idea.

- We'll let you think things over.
- [Adama breathing heavily]

777
00:45:18,041 --> 00:45:20,500
When we come back,
you better have something good to tell us.

Couldn't this wait
till I finished classes?

791
00:46:19,583 --> 00:46:20,625
It couldn't wait.

792
00:46:21,166 --> 00:46:22,625
You heard what people are saying?

793
00:46:23,791 --> 00:46:25,311
Your brother is holding Adama captive.

794
00:46:27,208 --> 00:46:28,041
Ridiculous.

795
00:46:28,125 --> 00:46:29,916
No, it's not ridiculous.

796
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,166
When I asked my boys about it,
they told me.

797
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:34,500
His mom called me looking for him.

798
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,833
- She's scared.
- Who said that?

799
00:46:37,416 --> 00:46:39,250
- [horn honks]
- I can't tell you.

800
00:46:39,333 --> 00:46:40,833
You don't trust me, is that it?

801
00:46:40,916 --> 00:46:43,166
Yes, of course I trust you.

802
00:46:43,916 --> 00:46:45,458
I just don't trust your brother.

803
00:46:45,541 --> 00:46:47,250
If he can do that to Adama, imagine me.

804
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:50,541
Look, I don't know what your friend said,
but he's full of shit, okay?

805
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:54,208
Ibra is no saint,
but stop blaming him for everything.

806
00:46:54,291 --> 00:46:55,583
He'd never do that to Adama.

807
00:46:55,666 --> 00:46:56,666
Really?

808
00:46:57,125 --> 00:46:58,365
Was he not close to killing me?

809
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,583
He was trying to protect me.
That's different.

810

[Malik scoffs]

811
00:47:02,875 --> 00:47:04,625
Stop making excuses for him all the time.

812
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:06,500
Open your eyes, please.

813
00:47:06,583 --> 00:47:07,583
For real.

814
00:47:09,208 --> 00:47:10,916

[Adama's mom] Oh no, my baby!
What have they done to you?

820
00:47:29,083 --> 00:47:30,833
My God! [sobs]

821
00:47:30,916 --> 00:47:31,958
[Adama groans]

822
00:47:36,208 --> 00:47:38,750
What's the matter with you?
Why would you beat him up like that?

823
00:47:38,833 --> 00:47:41,000
- Hey, calm down! Take it easy, damn it!
- [sobbing]

824
00:47:41,083 --> 00:47:42,875
Take it easy. Calm down.

825
00:47:42,958 --> 00:47:45,166
[Adama's mom] Let go of me! [whimpers]

826

[dramatic music playing]

828
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,083
You're gonna be okay.

829
00:47:56,708 --> 00:47:57,625
It's okay, baby.

830
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,000
Get him to say
what he was doing at Eddy's, got it?

831
00:48:00,083 --> 00:48:01,208
Or I'll kill him.

832
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:07,541
[door slams shut, locks]

833
00:48:08,666 --> 00:48:09,875
Let me clean you up.

834
00:48:10,541 --> 00:48:13,291
I'll make it all better.
I'll... I'll take care of you.

835
00:48:13,375 --> 00:48:15,291
[sobbing]

836
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:16,375
My baby.

837
00:48:17,708 --> 00:48:19,791
[inhales deeply] I can see.

838
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:24,750
My vision's improved.

[tender music playing]

840
00:48:35,666 --> 00:48:36,666
[Aïssata] Hmm.

841
00:48:44,541 --> 00:48:46,208
Have you heard from Adama?

842
00:48:48,916 --> 00:48:49,916
What do you mean?

843
00:48:50,708 --> 00:48:52,308
I guess Maimouna's been looking for him.

844
00:48:53,541 --> 00:48:54,958
Do you know where he is?

845
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:57,125
Why are you asking me?

846
00:48:57,833 --> 00:48:58,833
[Aïssata] No reason.

847
00:49:00,083 --> 00:49:02,791
It's just people have been saying things.

848
00:49:02,875 --> 00:49:04,208
What things?

849
00:49:06,625 --> 00:49:08,291
What are they saying? Spit it out.

850
00:49:09,791 --> 00:49:10,791
What is it?

851
00:49:13,541 --> 00:49:16,083
- You're holding Adama captive.
- What?

852
00:49:16,958 --> 00:49:17,958
Hey!

853
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,458
Ibé, tell me you didn't do that.

854
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:23,500
Ibé! Tell me that's not true.

855
00:49:24,291 --> 00:49:25,583
[exhales]

856
00:49:25,666 --> 00:49:28,833
Ibé, tell me you didn't do that.

857
00:49:28,916 --> 00:49:29,916
Ibé!

858
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,875
- He betrayed me.
- What?

859
00:49:32,875 --> 00:49:35,000
He did it to himself.
Nothing to do with me.

860
00:49:35,083 --> 00:49:37,541
You have to let him go, Ibra, please.
You need to let him go.

861
00:49:37,625 --> 00:49:39,416
- I can't. Not now.
- Mom.

862
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,851
Listen to your sister!
You can't do that! He's your brother!

863
00:49:41,875 --> 00:49:43,955
- He's not family anymore.
- [Agna] What do you mean?

864
00:49:44,791 --> 00:49:47,291
Mind your own business.
Leave me alone to my own affairs.

865
00:49:47,375 --> 00:49:49,958
No, we won't mind our business.
This is serious.

866
00:49:50,041 --> 00:49:52,250
- Did you know he beat up Malik too?
- Ibé...

867
00:49:52,333 --> 00:49:53,583
He almost killed him.

868
00:49:55,666 --> 00:49:58,625
- Dad never would've let you do this.
- Shut the fuck up!

869
00:49:59,125 --> 00:50:01,125
What's with you? Shut your fucking mouth!

870
00:50:01,208 --> 00:50:02,916
Don't talk about him here, okay?

871
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,791
Say his name one more time!

872
00:50:04,875 --> 00:50:06,995
Where was he when you had to pay
for your rich school?

873
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,083
And when you needed a computer?

874
00:50:09,625 --> 00:50:11,500
When we had to pay for this place?

875
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,875
I'm out here grinding for you!

876
00:50:12,958 --> 00:50:15,767
You can't imagine what it's like
having a million problems to deal with,

877
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:17,391
but I do it so you can have a good life!

878
00:50:17,458 --> 00:50:19,375
Oh, I see! It's mom's and my fault?

879
00:50:19,458 --> 00:50:22,583
- Be a thug with everyone else, but not us!
- What the hell do you think?

880
00:50:22,666 --> 00:50:25,750
You think this all comes from thin air?
That, that, that, all this?

881
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:27,750
How does it all come to be here?

882
00:50:27,833 --> 00:50:30,916
You don't think I want to do legit things
like all your rich Parisian friends?

883
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,375
That's right, play the victim.

884
00:50:32,458 --> 00:50:33,738
[Ibrahim] Ain't no victims here!

885
00:50:33,791 --> 00:50:35,708
Ain't no victims here!
Don't even start with me!

886
00:50:35,791 --> 00:50:38,458
I made all my money on my own,
and I don't owe anybody a thing!

887
00:50:38,541 --> 00:50:40,851
[Aïssata] You can have your dirty money!
What do you think?

888
00:50:40,875 --> 00:50:42,791
[Ibrahim]
Stop pretending like you don't get it!

889
00:50:42,875 --> 00:50:45,476
- [Aïssata] My conscience isn't for sale!
- [Ibrahim] This is just business!

890
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,041
You can't do what I do
without commanding respect, got that?

891
00:50:48,125 --> 00:50:51,333
[Aïssata] If you want blood on your hands,
go ahead! But you're on your own.

892
00:50:51,458 --> 00:50:53,059
[Ibrahim] You don't know
what you're talking about!

893
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:54,934
[Aïssata] You think I give a fuck
about your money?

894
00:50:54,958 --> 00:50:56,642
- [Ibrahim] Stop getting on my nerves!
- [Aïssata] You first!

895
00:50:56,666 --> 00:50:59,458
- [Ibrahim] To hell with you!
- [Aïssata] Be gone! Piece of shit!

Bring them in.

Come on, this way.

929
00:53:24,833 --> 00:53:26,041
You sure about this?

930
00:53:26,625 --> 00:53:27,666
What's the risk?

931
00:53:28,333 --> 00:53:30,458
She's an old lady. He's a blind kid.

932
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:32,875
And I figure...

933
00:53:34,791 --> 00:53:37,291
if your enemy's family joins your side,

934
00:53:37,375 --> 00:53:38,916
you have him in your hand.

935
00:53:40,541 --> 00:53:42,666

She said she came for you,
but I didn't see her come down here.

941
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:06,666
Shut the fuck up!

942

- [friend] Ibra! Stop!

- I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!
- Ibra! Ibra! Stop!

- Look!
- Easy! Come on.

950
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:22,541
Look!

951
00:54:22,625 --> 00:54:23,625
I know.

952
00:54:24,291 --> 00:54:26,041
[Ibrahim] Look at what they did!

953
00:54:26,125 --> 00:54:27,625

[Maimouna] Adama.

960
00:55:13,958 --> 00:55:15,250
[Adama] Hmm?

961
00:55:19,291 --> 00:55:22,500
While we're here, no one can know
you've recovered your eyesight.

962
00:55:24,375 --> 00:55:27,416
It's like a shield.
No one suspects a blind person.

963
00:55:34,875 --> 00:55:35,875
[Maimouna sighs]

964
00:55:37,583 --> 00:55:40,583
You can't be a murderer
if you're a blind person.

965
00:55:43,791 --> 00:55:45,250
Come here, my boy.

I know, my son.

973
00:56:06,083 --> 00:56:07,291
I'm aware of that.

974
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:10,500
But just stay blind.

975
00:56:11,333 --> 00:56:13,500
No one will be able to question you.

976
00:56:19,083 --> 00:56:21,166
Remember what Dad used to say.

977
00:56:22,833 --> 00:56:24,958
Make a strength of your weakness.

978
00:56:30,583 --> 00:56:31,916

I was at the grocery store.

Grocery store?

997
00:58:44,291 --> 00:58:45,331
You store groceries there?

998
00:58:46,083 --> 00:58:49,083
No, it's just because...
because the store was closed.

999
00:58:56,791 --> 00:58:58,831
[mom in Arabic] Ask Aïssata
if she's eating with us.

1000

You're already on thin ice.

She's looking for you!

There's nothing?

1028

No sign she'll wake up?

- [Malik] No.
- [Adama sucks teeth]

1030

01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:19,708
It's all gone wrong.

1047
01:02:20,333 --> 01:02:22,253
I had to see you and talk to you
because of this.

1048
01:02:22,333 --> 01:02:23,750
We need to do something.

1049
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:27,541
I'm moved by what you're saying,
but what can I do?

1050
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:29,583
Huh?

1051
01:02:29,666 --> 01:02:30,666
I don't know.

1052
01:02:31,583 --> 01:02:32,583
I don't know.

1053
01:02:35,833 --> 01:02:37,791
[Malik breathes deeply]

1054
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:40,541
Maybe...

1055
01:02:40,625 --> 01:02:44,041
[breathing shakily]

1056
01:02:44,125 --> 01:02:45,833
Maybe you should go to the cops.

1057
01:02:47,666 --> 01:02:48,666
What?

1058
01:02:49,458 --> 01:02:50,541
This has to end.

1059
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,916
Go and tell them what happened.
Tell them what Ibrahim did.

1060
01:02:56,375 --> 01:02:58,208
I don't love the police either, bro.

1061
01:02:58,916 --> 01:03:00,208
We don't have a choice.

1062
01:03:00,708 --> 01:03:01,833
It's gone too far.

1063
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:06,083
[Adama breathes deeply]

1064
01:03:06,166 --> 01:03:07,666
What do I say about Agna?

1065
01:03:09,333 --> 01:03:10,666
Well, tell them the truth.

1066
01:03:11,791 --> 01:03:14,958
Tell them you're blind, you can't see,
and you didn't know it was her.

1067
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:18,375
You thought it was Ibrahim and his gang
were coming to kill your mother and you.

1068
01:03:18,875 --> 01:03:21,541
- Go with the truth.
- He'll never go to prison.

1069
01:03:23,125 --> 01:03:24,125
Never.

1070
01:03:25,041 --> 01:03:28,000
I have no proof of what he did.
Nothing. Not even a fucking stash.

1071
01:03:30,916 --> 01:03:32,000
Did he squeal?

1072
01:03:33,166 --> 01:03:34,625
- To the cops?
- Mm-hmm.

1073
01:03:34,708 --> 01:03:35,750
No.

1074
01:03:35,833 --> 01:03:39,166
Of course he didn't squeal to the cops.
He's not the type who'd go to the cops.

1075
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:40,541
[Adama sighs]

1076
01:03:40,625 --> 01:03:42,541
Even Aïssata can't tell anybody.

1077
01:03:43,291 --> 01:03:45,666
- [Adama sighs]
- They want you specifically.

1078
01:03:47,541 --> 01:03:49,833
[gentle music playing]

1079
01:03:52,458 --> 01:03:54,541
[breathes deeply]

1080
01:04:01,625 --> 01:04:02,875
[doorbell rings]

1081
01:04:05,166 --> 01:04:06,833
Morning, Aïssata.

1082
01:04:06,916 --> 01:04:09,791
- [Aïssata] How you doing, sweetie?
- Good. Malik isn't home.

1083
01:04:09,875 --> 01:04:11,835
I know.
I just came to get something, and I'll go.

1084
01:04:11,916 --> 01:04:13,036
Is your mom not home either?

1085
01:04:13,083 --> 01:04:14,583
No, she's at work.

1086
01:04:14,666 --> 01:04:16,000
Okay. Can I come in?

1087
01:04:36,375 --> 01:04:37,375
[sighs]

1088
01:04:57,916 --> 01:05:00,916
- I can't fucking believe this!
- [both chuckle]

1089
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Stop it.

1090
01:05:02,333 --> 01:05:03,791
- Holy shit!
- [Adama chuckles]

1091
01:05:03,875 --> 01:05:05,583
I mean, this is fucking wonderful!

1092
01:05:05,666 --> 01:05:07,625
- Like, you see me?
- Mm-hmm.

1093
01:05:07,708 --> 01:05:09,291
[Malik] It's like a fucking miracle!

1094
01:05:09,791 --> 01:05:11,333
Holy shit.

1095
01:05:11,416 --> 01:05:12,416
[Adama sighs]

1096
01:05:13,041 --> 01:05:13,916
It can happen.

1097
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
What?

1098
01:05:15,916 --> 01:05:17,708
The blind getting their sight back.

1099
01:05:17,791 --> 01:05:18,791
[Malik] What do you mean?

1100
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:23,333
[sighs] In times of emotional duress, or...

1101
01:05:24,041 --> 01:05:26,458
after a blow to the head,
you can get your sight back.

1102
01:05:28,791 --> 01:05:30,541
But Agna was a real accident.

1103
01:05:32,666 --> 01:05:35,208
My vision was still blurry
when it happened.

1104
01:05:37,458 --> 01:05:38,858
I thought he was coming to kill us.

1105
01:05:38,916 --> 01:05:40,166
I believe you.

1106
01:05:44,291 --> 01:05:45,291
[Malik sighs]

1107
01:05:46,333 --> 01:05:47,916
I have to get out of here, bro.

1108
01:05:48,416 --> 01:05:50,750
I can't stay locked up like this
day and night with my mom.

1109
01:05:50,833 --> 01:05:52,333
I can't. Not anymore.

1110
01:05:52,833 --> 01:05:54,083
I need to move far away.

1111
01:05:55,458 --> 01:05:56,458
[Adama sniffles]

1112
01:05:57,375 --> 01:05:59,625
I need to run away.
That's the only way to solve this.

1113
01:05:59,708 --> 01:06:01,468
I've always been a burden
on everyone anyway.

1114
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:02,916
Come on, stop it.

1115
01:06:08,333 --> 01:06:09,333
Thanks for this.

1116
01:06:10,916 --> 01:06:11,916
Thanks, bro.

1117
01:06:16,458 --> 01:06:19,083
[sobbing]

1118
01:06:19,166 --> 01:06:20,166
[sniffles]

1119
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:21,666
[door unlocks]

1120
01:06:27,166 --> 01:06:28,250
[Aïssata sniffles]

1121
01:06:34,541 --> 01:06:36,083
- You all right?
- Mm-hmm.

1122
01:06:47,708 --> 01:06:49,958
- You don't look all right.
- No, I'm fine.

1123
01:06:56,458 --> 01:06:57,541
What's the matter?

1124
01:06:58,125 --> 01:06:59,125
Nothing.

1125
01:06:59,666 --> 01:07:01,083
Come on, you can talk to me.

1126
01:07:01,833 --> 01:07:02,916
Is it about Mom?

1127
01:07:03,958 --> 01:07:05,291
What, did the hospital call?

1128
01:07:08,833 --> 01:07:09,833
What is it?

1129
01:07:13,875 --> 01:07:15,041
We can find him.

1130
01:07:17,208 --> 01:07:18,791
We can find Adama.

1131
01:07:21,875 --> 01:07:24,208
Look, I want that as much as you do.

1132
01:07:24,291 --> 01:07:26,251
But I need you to promise me
you won't hurt Malik.

1133
01:07:27,083 --> 01:07:28,934
What's up with him?
What does he have to do with this?

1134
01:07:28,958 --> 01:07:29,958
Promise.

1135
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:32,916
[Ibrahim sucks teeth, sighs]

1136
01:07:37,333 --> 01:07:38,333
Go on.

1137
01:07:41,125 --> 01:07:42,125
[Adama groans softly]

1138

[Adama gasps]

1143
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:56,791
Eddy wants to see you.

1144
01:07:56,875 --> 01:07:57,958
[Malik grunts]

1145
01:07:58,041 --> 01:08:00,125
[Eddy] There's a right hook and another.

1146
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,101
- [Malik] <i>Let go of me!</i>
- [Eddy] Going to get something.

1147
01:08:03,125 --> 01:08:04,958
<i>What are you doing? What's that?</i>

1148
01:08:05,041 --> 01:08:07,559
- [Eddy] Shears. He grabbed shears.
<i>- What're you doing with that?</i>

1149
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:10,125
<i>No, no, no! Don't do that!
Stop, please! </i>[exhales]

1150

- [shears snip]
- [Malik yells] Fuck!

1151
01:08:13,041 --> 01:08:14,750
Oh, damn it! Oh!

1152
01:08:14,833 --> 01:08:17,166
- [Malik groaning]
- [breathing angrily]

1153
01:08:18,333 --> 01:08:19,333
There's that.

1154
01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:22,583
He left something for you.

1155
01:08:37,916 --> 01:08:39,208
[Adama exhales]

1156
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,166
[breathes shakily]

1157
01:09:02,458 --> 01:09:03,458
I understand.

1158
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,416
Don't worry. [sniffles]

1159
01:09:07,708 --> 01:09:10,333
He said your buddy is in your basement.
He wants you to join him.

1160
01:09:10,958 --> 01:09:12,125
If I hand you over,

1161
01:09:12,791 --> 01:09:15,875
in exchange, he'll let me use
a few trap houses for a couple months.

1162
01:09:22,333 --> 01:09:24,000
[sniffles] Which I accepted.

1163
01:09:26,791 --> 01:09:27,875
You don't blame me, do you?

1164
01:09:28,958 --> 01:09:30,958
[sniffles] It's all just business.

1165
01:09:38,916 --> 01:09:39,916
Take him away.

1166
01:09:43,208 --> 01:09:44,666
[man clicks tongue] Come on.

1167
01:09:48,333 --> 01:09:50,458
What if I could promise you
the whole projects?

1168
01:09:58,041 --> 01:09:59,416
[Maimouna sobbing]

1169
01:10:07,083 --> 01:10:08,333
All right, let's go.

1174
01:10:30,916 --> 01:10:33,291
[thug] I say we just wait
a little longer, Ibra.

1175
01:10:34,666 --> 01:10:37,083
We're cornered.
Those bastards must be waiting.

1176
01:10:37,166 --> 01:10:38,583
- And plus...
- [door opens]

1177
01:10:39,208 --> 01:10:40,500
You promised me.

1178
01:10:40,583 --> 01:10:41,708
You fucking promised me!

1179
01:10:41,791 --> 01:10:44,059
- Aïssata, come on. Get out.
- Oumar, let go of me, please.

1180
01:10:44,083 --> 01:10:46,333
Ibra, I'm begging you. Please let him go.

1181
01:10:46,416 --> 01:10:48,916
If you love me, let him go.
Please listen to me, Ibra.

1182
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,559
Please! Mom's in a coma because of you!

1183
01:10:50,583 --> 01:10:52,291
You don't want to see it, but everything,

1184
01:10:52,375 --> 01:10:56,000
everything that's happening
is because of you! You! Damn it, let go!

1185
01:10:56,083 --> 01:10:58,375
Let go of me, damn it! Stop!

1186
01:11:00,333 --> 01:11:02,653
- You let me out! Open the door, damn it!
- [bangs on door]

1187
01:11:02,708 --> 01:11:06,125
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You've gone mad! Let me out!

1188
01:11:06,208 --> 01:11:09,041
- Let me out!

It's over.
