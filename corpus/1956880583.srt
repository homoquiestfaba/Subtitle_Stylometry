00:01:34,954 --> 00:01:37,924
Gather around, everyone.
Please, Doris, Diane.

9
00:01:37,957 --> 00:01:39,926
With this being Judy's last
morning with us,

10
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:42,929
I was thinking it'd be nice
if we could go around the room

11
00:01:42,962 --> 00:01:46,531
and say what we appreciate most about her.
I'll start us off.

12
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:47,566
Scott, you really don't need
to...

13
00:01:47,967 --> 00:01:48,968
Your scones.

14
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:52,972
Judy, your scones are truly a
revelation.

15
00:01:53,371 --> 00:01:58,945
One bite, one crumb can send me places
I never before dreamt I could go.

16
00:01:59,344 --> 00:02:06,953
Your flavor combinations are so refined
and, excuse my language, freakin' electric.

17
00:02:08,955 --> 00:02:12,925
Look at me here.
I'm babbling on and on.

18
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,961
Doris, is there something you'd
like to say?

19
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,361
Sure.

20
00:02:16,996 --> 00:02:22,935
Well, Judy, even though I wouldn't
feed your macaroons to my dogs.

21
00:02:22,969 --> 00:02:27,940
I still respect your work ethic and
don't wish you any specific harm.

22
00:02:27,974 --> 00:02:29,976
[Bell ring]

23
00:02:30,977 --> 00:02:33,946
I am so sorry to cut this short.

24
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,614
Doris, a moving tribute.

25
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:39,952
I'm so grateful to have had the opportunity
to work alongside each one of you.

26
00:02:40,352 --> 00:02:45,958
But I have to go now.
My planet needs me. Bye.

27
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:54,967
I thought her scones were shit.

28
00:02:55,768 --> 00:02:58,938
Gary, come on, dude. That's all
wrong, dude.

29
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:01,974
The Quilt Queens? And the P...
whose P is that? Why is there a P...

30
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:04,342
Amir.

31
00:03:04,376 --> 00:03:07,980
Judy, hi. As you can see,
we're busy today so what do you want?

32
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:09,982
As promised.

33
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:11,951
Okay. I'll listen to it.

34
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:12,985
Okay.

35
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:21,928
What? What? Why are you still
here?

36
00:03:21,961 --> 00:03:26,933
Oh, uh. I see Shark Dick just
dropped off the Queef Queens show.

37
00:03:26,966 --> 00:03:28,935
Very perceptive. What gave that
away?

38
00:03:28,968 --> 00:03:32,939
Have you found a replacement opener yet?
Will there be a replacement?

39
00:03:32,972 --> 00:03:34,941
I don't know. I don't know.

40
00:03:34,974 --> 00:03:36,943
Well, you know, we could open.

41
00:03:36,976 --> 00:03:39,946
Listen. I just, it's not a good idea.
I don't think that's...

42
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:41,147
Amir, please.

43
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,951
You said we needed something
recorded, so we made a demo.

44
00:03:44,984 --> 00:03:48,120
You said we needed some experience, so
we are about to embark on our first tour.

45
00:03:48,154 --> 00:03:51,991
Can you please, just please, listen to
the tape before you make a decision?

46
00:03:53,993 --> 00:03:55,962
Fine, fine. Just leave.

47
00:03:55,995 --> 00:03:56,963
Okay.

48
00:03:56,996 --> 00:03:58,264
Just go.

49
00:03:58,297 --> 00:03:59,999
All right. I'll call you later
today to see what you think.

50
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,935
If you call me before Friday
morning, I'm going to burn the demo.

51
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:04,937
All right. Friday morning it is.

52
00:04:04,971 --> 00:04:05,938
Goodbye.

53
00:04:05,972 --> 00:04:06,973
Kay. Hi.

54
00:04:08,975 --> 00:04:10,977
Go. Leave.

55
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:14,981
Yes!

56
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:45,978
[Loud bang]

57
00:04:51,984 --> 00:04:52,952
Morning.

58
00:04:52,985 --> 00:04:54,586
It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon.

59
00:04:55,988 --> 00:04:58,991
Mel. Mel!

60
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:04,964
This place is still a sty. I thought you
two were gonna clean it while I was gone.

61
00:05:04,997 --> 00:05:06,999
I had to replace all my drum
heads.

62
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,568
I started to clean

63
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,972
but then I needed to get high
cause I hate cleaning.

64
00:05:13,005 --> 00:05:16,008
But then I got tired
cause weed makes me sleepy.

65
00:05:16,809 --> 00:05:18,978
Then I needed to sleep, so I
slept.

66
00:05:19,011 --> 00:05:22,014
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:23,015 --> 00:05:24,984
Band meeting. Kitchen.

68
00:05:26,986 --> 00:05:29,587
Let's go. Up, up, up!

69
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:42,001
Okay. So... jobs quit, bags packed, merch
boxed, guitars strung, drum heads replaced.

70
00:05:44,003 --> 00:05:46,005
Tour route mapped.

71
00:05:47,605 --> 00:05:53,980
Six shows, seven days, with the possibility
of a seventh show back here with...

72
00:05:54,013 --> 00:05:56,015
Mel, drum roll, please.

73
00:06:02,021 --> 00:06:04,991
The Queef Queens.

74
00:06:05,024 --> 00:06:05,992
The House of Independents show?

75
00:06:06,025 --> 00:06:07,960
The very same.

76
00:06:07,994 --> 00:06:08,961
Shutup.

77
00:06:08,995 --> 00:06:10,363
No way.

78
00:06:10,396 --> 00:06:12,965
Yes, way. And we all know who
drums for the Queef Queens, right?

79
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:13,966
No.

80
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,968
Yes. Jenn Jennings.

81
00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:18,971
And we all know Jenn Jennings'
claim to fame, right?

82
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:20,006
No.

83
00:06:22,008 --> 00:06:23,042
Also, no.

84
00:06:23,075 --> 00:06:26,012
She is owner, operator of
Alliteration Records.

85
00:06:26,812 --> 00:06:28,981
Oh, man. Alliteration has such
an awesome roster of bands.

86
00:06:29,015 --> 00:06:30,582
Yeah.

87
00:06:30,615 --> 00:06:35,021
In the past year alone, they've put out
the Brain Busters LP, the Acid Cat EP,

88
00:06:35,421 --> 00:06:38,623
and two seven inches from Turd
Toilet.

89
00:06:39,025 --> 00:06:41,994
And the soon to be released
debut album from DUH.

90
00:06:42,028 --> 00:06:44,030
Precisely.

91
00:06:45,031 --> 00:06:46,999
We open for the Queef Queens.

92
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:49,969
Jenn Jennings sees us, Jenn
Jennings loves us.

93
00:06:50,002 --> 00:06:51,971
I give Jenn Jennings our demo.

94
00:06:52,004 --> 00:06:54,974
Jenn Jennings offers us a record
deal.

95
00:06:55,007 --> 00:06:56,976
We no longer have to work shit
jobs

96
00:06:57,009 --> 00:07:00,980
and we just get to tour and make
music for the rest of our lives.

97
00:07:01,013 --> 00:07:03,615
Fuckin' A. Yeah!

98
00:07:04,016 --> 00:07:09,021
I wouldn't celebrate just yet,
or ever.

99
00:07:11,023 --> 00:07:14,627
Life has a way of dangling these
small carrots of opportunity

100
00:07:15,027 --> 00:07:16,028
in front of our faces,

101
00:07:16,829 --> 00:07:20,032
ready to completely destroy and
dismantle any hope in sight.

102
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:30,009
The world is chaos. And, though
together, we are alone to suffer.

103
00:07:37,016 --> 00:07:41,020
Okay. Everybody up. Up, c'mon.

104
00:07:44,023 --> 00:07:50,029
We're going on tour, yeah! We're going
on tour, yeah! We're going on tour, yeah!

105
00:07:51,030 --> 00:08:01,040
[Big sludgy music]

106
00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:05,010
Okay. Max.

107
00:08:05,044 --> 00:08:09,014
I don't want us to look like a bunch
of amateurs on our very first tour,

108
00:08:09,048 --> 00:08:11,984
so let's practice some stage
banter.

109
00:08:12,017 --> 00:08:12,985
Right now?

110
00:08:13,018 --> 00:08:13,986
Yes.

111
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:14,987
Why?

112
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,021
Because you suck at talking.

113
00:08:17,022 --> 00:08:18,991
Mm-hm. Let's role play.

114
00:08:19,024 --> 00:08:21,994
Pretend we just finished our
first song.

115
00:08:22,027 --> 00:08:23,028
What would you say?

116
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:29,034
Okay. Uh... hi, I'm Max and I'm
here to say, uh

117
00:08:29,835 --> 00:08:34,006
we're in the band DUH,
and we're playing right now.

118
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:38,010
And, um... we hope you all like
music...

119
00:08:38,043 --> 00:08:42,014
Um... our music, uh, cause,
you know, music's special, um,

120
00:08:42,047 --> 00:08:46,018
and you're special
for being here with us tonight.

121
00:08:46,051 --> 00:08:46,852
Okay. Please stop.

122
00:08:46,886 --> 00:08:49,021
Why? What's wrong with
that... Whoa!

123
00:08:49,054 --> 00:08:50,022
[Hard fall]

124
00:08:50,055 --> 00:08:52,057
[Groaning]

125
00:08:53,058 --> 00:08:54,994
Yikes.

126
00:08:55,027 --> 00:08:57,997
Aw. Jesus, Max. Are you okay?

127
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,032
Yeah, all good. Face broke the
fall.

128
00:09:01,033 --> 00:09:05,037
Aw.
Now, where is the van?

129
00:09:06,038 --> 00:09:12,044
Huh. Uh... oh, I see it.

130
00:09:15,047 --> 00:09:16,048
Shit.

131
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:19,018
No, no, no. Stop!
Do not get in that van! I'm coming!

132
00:09:19,051 --> 00:09:21,020
That's weird. Do we know those
guys?

133
00:09:21,053 --> 00:09:23,055
The van's getting repoed,
dumbass.

134
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:27,059
Please, don't!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

135
00:09:29,061 --> 00:09:31,030
Goddammit!

136
00:09:31,063 --> 00:09:34,033
My one-hitter was in there.
Fuck.

137
00:09:34,066 --> 00:09:36,001
Why is this happening?

138
00:09:36,035 --> 00:09:42,041
Guys, we can fix this.
We can. I think. Probably.

139
00:09:44,043 --> 00:09:49,048
I warned us last night.
The world is cruel and unforgiving.

140
00:09:52,051 --> 00:09:52,851
Shit.

141
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,023
Now that I think about it, the
creditors were calling a lot last week.

142
00:09:58,057 --> 00:10:00,025
Fuuuuuuu...

143
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:10,069
[Whimsical music]

144
00:10:18,043 --> 00:10:21,013
Okay. Last one.

145
00:10:21,046 --> 00:10:23,048
Say a little prayer.

146
00:10:33,058 --> 00:10:35,060
Now, the waiting game.

147
00:10:37,062 --> 00:10:38,030
Hey!

148
00:10:38,063 --> 00:10:39,031
Keep walking.

149
00:10:39,064 --> 00:10:41,066
Hey, is this you?

150
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:47,039
You the kids that just tagged my
windshield?

151
00:10:47,072 --> 00:10:49,074
Uh... yes.

152
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:55,047
That is my property.
You are soliciting on private property.

153
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,049
We're sorry, sir.

154
00:10:57,082 --> 00:10:58,050
Mm-hm.

155
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,052
Now, what's the meaning of this?

156
00:11:00,853 --> 00:11:04,056
Okay. We didn't know you were in
there, so I'll just take this...

157
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:09,028
Now, what do you guys need a van
for?

158
00:11:09,061 --> 00:11:11,063
Cause of the man, man.

159
00:11:13,065 --> 00:11:18,037
Yeah. And we need it pronto
so that our band can go on tour.

160
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,038
You guys are in a band?

161
00:11:19,071 --> 00:11:20,072
Yeah.

162
00:11:21,073 --> 00:11:23,042
Oh shit. You guys rip?

163
00:11:23,075 --> 00:11:26,045
Well, I believe we do. Yeah.

164
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:27,079
Oh. Right on.

165
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,083
Well, does that mean
that we can borrow your van?

166
00:11:33,085 --> 00:11:34,086
Well, no.

167
00:11:35,689 --> 00:11:44,063
Full disclosure, that van back there also
happens to be my home for the moment.

168
00:11:44,863 --> 00:11:49,034
You see, in this cut-throat,
capitalistic world in which we now live,

169
00:11:49,068 --> 00:11:52,071
your boy has fallen on hard
times.

170
00:11:54,473 --> 00:11:58,077
The game is rigged and I am but
a casualty.

171
00:11:58,477 --> 00:12:00,079
A victim.

172
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:03,082
But I am hopeful.

173

[Cop car siren]

174
00:12:27,072 --> 00:12:31,076
Hey. I can drive y'all.

175
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:37,049
I can roadie, too. I mean, every

wouldn't be one of us next time?

Shit, no.

Hey, Peck, do you have diabetes.

No, why?

357
00:27:59,071 --> 00:28:01,073
I thought so.

What's that?

359
00:28:04,076 --> 00:28:07,079
You know exactly what this is.

360
00:28:07,913 --> 00:28:12,084
I found this in his glove
compartment earlier today.

361
00:28:13,085 --> 00:28:15,054
So you're on smack, too.

362
00:28:15,087 --> 00:28:18,090
Aw Peck. Say it ain't so.

363
00:28:19,091 --> 00:28:20,326
Now, now hold the phone.

364
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:25,064
You think that, that I use
this for shooting dope? Hardly.

365
00:28:25,864 --> 00:28:30,035
How do you think I control this
thing, huh?

366
00:28:30,069 --> 00:28:36,041
I use this to sedate myself every
night to keep the beast at bay.

367
00:28:36,075 --> 00:28:36,909
Sorry.

368
00:28:36,942 --> 00:28:41,046
Why wasn't the beast kept at bay
tonight?

369
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:44,049
For, for one thing
I didn't think it was right

370
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:48,053
for some joker to take advantage
of my friends like that.

371
00:28:48,087 --> 00:28:52,224
And when I saw how worried Judy
was about getting to the next show,

372
00:28:52,257 --> 00:28:58,097
what with lack of funds for gas and
food, well, I had to do something.

373
00:28:59,098 --> 00:29:02,101
So I stuck up for all of us.

374

By eating him.

375
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:09,041
I realize that some might think
that that's an extreme response,

376
00:29:09,074 --> 00:29:12,077
but how else were we gonna to
get paid?

377
00:29:13,078 --> 00:29:15,047
Well, we didn't get paid, so.

Holy shit.

381
00:29:30,095 --> 00:29:36,101
There's enough here for gas and
food, maybe even a shower.

382
00:29:38,103 --> 00:29:43,075
I understand how scary that must
have looked.

383
00:29:43,108 --> 00:29:45,077
But I got this. Hmm?

384
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:54,086

No.

389
00:30:26,118 --> 00:30:28,053
Come on, Judy. I think we
should give him another chance.

390
00:30:28,086 --> 00:30:32,057
No. He is literally a man-eating
monster.

00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:37,062

fucked us and a ton of other bands, too.

He said it wouldn't happen again.

No.

Uh, continue to let him drive us
around.

and gas and snacks and...

No no no, I mean like what did
he look like?

Like, did he get like all ripped
like Incredible Hulk

or did he like turn into a sexy
panther like in Cat People?

No. No, nothing like that.

414
00:32:44,924 --> 00:32:51,129
He was just like a paler, uglier
version of himself if you can imagine.

It's tough.

416

Aren't you the slightest bit worried
that he could turn on one of us?

417

Mmm. No.

418

in place.

death anymore.

Oh, well. That's tough to say.
