00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:53,485
[adult Theo] <i>In Amsterdam,</i>

3
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:55,955
<i>I dreamt
I saw my mother again.</i>

4
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:02,061
<i>She was just as glad to see me
as I was to see her.</i>

5
00:01:06,798 --> 00:01:09,601
<i>Same beautiful pale blue eyes.</i>

6
00:01:14,906 --> 00:01:18,477
<i>Everything would've turned out
better if she had lived.</i>

7
00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:26,819
<i>As it was,
she died when I was a kid.</i>

8
00:01:28,286 --> 00:01:30,422
<i>And when I lost her...</i>

9
00:01:30,556 --> 00:01:32,691
<i>I lost sight of any landmark</i>

10
00:01:32,824 --> 00:01:35,595
<i>that might've led me
some place happier.</i>

11
00:01:40,732 --> 00:01:43,034
<i>You see,
her death was my fault.</i>

12
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:48,105
<i>Everybody used to tell me
that it wasn't.</i>

13
00:01:49,173 --> 00:01:51,443
<i>That it was
a terrible accident.</i>

14
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,783
<i>Which is all perfectly true.</i>

15
00:02:00,117 --> 00:02:02,421
<i>And I don't believe
a word of it.</i>

16
00:02:05,324 --> 00:02:06,926
<i>It was my fault.</i>

17
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,997
<i>Just like everything
that's happened since.</i>

18
00:02:13,364 --> 00:02:15,066
<i>The painting.</i>

19
00:02:17,435 --> 00:02:19,171
<i>The painting.</i>

20
00:02:22,741 --> 00:02:24,910
<i>All my fault.</i>

21
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:30,215
<i>I lost something that
should have been immortal.</i>

22
00:02:32,618 --> 00:02:34,587
<i>I didn't mean to do it.</i>

23
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:40,226
<i>Because what I've done
cannot be undone.</i>

24
00:02:44,362 --> 00:02:46,998
<i>It doesn't matter
that I'm going to die.</i>

25
00:02:50,601 --> 00:02:52,670
<i>But for all time,</i>

26
00:02:52,804 --> 00:02:56,374
<i>for as long
as history is written,</i>

27
00:02:56,509 --> 00:03:01,981
<i>that painting will be
remembered and mourned.</i>

28
00:03:22,034 --> 00:03:23,736
[man] <i>As best we can tell,</i>

29
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:25,736
<i>he made his own way back
to his mother's apartment</i>

30
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,304
<i>from the museum.</i>

31
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:29,274
<i>He waited there for her
all night to come back</i>

32
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,809
<i>and when she didn't,</i>

33
00:03:30,941 --> 00:03:33,344
he rang the emergency number
they were showing on TV.

34
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,114
When they realized his age,
they alerted us.

35
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:37,683
[woman] I don't know
if you're aware

36
00:03:37,815 --> 00:03:39,217
but Theo's father
left the family

37
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,484
about six months ago.

38
00:03:40,618 --> 00:03:42,253
[Mrs. Barbour] I wasn't aware.

39
00:03:42,387 --> 00:03:45,423
My son and Theo were friends
in elementary school.

40
00:03:45,557 --> 00:03:46,659
To my knowledge,
they haven't seen

41
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,293
much of each other
for a while.

42
00:03:51,662 --> 00:03:53,864
I'm afraid
I don't quite understand.

43
00:03:54,366 --> 00:03:55,801
Uh, right now,

44
00:03:55,934 --> 00:03:58,102
he is a minor child

45
00:03:58,237 --> 00:04:00,873
in need of temporary
emergency care.

46
00:04:01,005 --> 00:04:03,741
When we asked Theo
if he could think of anyone

47
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,643
that might be able
to help for a while,

48
00:04:06,211 --> 00:04:07,713
he suggested you.

49
00:04:13,485 --> 00:04:14,886
Come in, come in.

50
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:17,790
I'm afraid Andy isn't up yet.

51
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:20,660
You can rest here if you like.

52
00:04:27,932 --> 00:04:29,901
[Mr. Barbour] Let's get you
squared away.

53
00:04:30,802 --> 00:04:32,171
Oh, here we are.

54
00:04:33,571 --> 00:04:34,941
You'll be...

55
00:04:36,675 --> 00:04:38,276
You'll be feeling
awfully rough.

56
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:42,013
Hell of a thing to happen.

57
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,849
Good Lord.

58
00:04:44,816 --> 00:04:45,917
In the circumstances,

59
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,119
I wouldn't see the harm
in pouring you

60
00:04:48,252 --> 00:04:50,221
what my father used to call
a minor nip,

61
00:04:50,355 --> 00:04:51,956
- if you should want some.
- Chance.

62
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,858
[chuckling]
Which of course you don't.

63
00:04:53,992 --> 00:04:55,861
Quite unsuitable.

64
00:04:55,994 --> 00:04:58,064
[Mrs. Barbour] We're perfectly
happy to have you, Theo.

65
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:02,201
I hope you'll make yourself
as comfortable as you can.

66
00:05:09,975 --> 00:05:11,711
[footsteps receding]

67
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,052
[young Andy] What's happening?

68
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:22,388
[Mrs. Barbour] Shh. That's Theo.
His mom passed away.

69
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:23,888
[knock at door]

70
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,892
Someone to see you, Theo.

71
00:05:36,501 --> 00:05:37,637
[young Andy] Wow.

72
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,872
Disturbing.

73
00:05:42,674 --> 00:05:43,809
Yeah.

74
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,278
[Mrs. Barbour] <i>No,</i>

75
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,713
<i>apparently no one has any idea
where he is.</i>

76
00:05:48,847 --> 00:05:50,382
<i>He wasn't paying
child support.</i>

77
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:54,020
He left debts. He more or less
flew town without a word.

78
00:05:56,054 --> 00:05:57,456
I don't think we had a choice.

79
00:05:57,588 --> 00:05:59,257
<i>We couldn't very well
turn the boy away.</i>

80
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:03,128
<i>No. Just for a few weeks.</i>

81
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:04,829
[Mr. Barbour]
Do you sail, Theo?

82
00:06:05,763 --> 00:06:07,331
No, sir.

83
00:06:07,465 --> 00:06:08,766
That's a pity.

84
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,736
Andy had the most
outstanding time

85
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:12,470
at his sailing camp
up in Maine last year.

86
00:06:12,603 --> 00:06:14,706
They were the worst
two weeks of my life.

87
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,174
Nonsense.

88
00:06:16,307 --> 00:06:18,944
You lack confidence.
That's all.

89
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:21,179
Would you like me to ask Etta

90
00:06:21,312 --> 00:06:22,947
to make you something else
to eat, Theo?

91
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:25,917
I'm not hungry.

92
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:27,853
Thank you.

93
00:06:27,985 --> 00:06:29,187
Where's his dad?

94
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:31,290
Good question.

95
00:06:31,422 --> 00:06:32,925
Oh, my God!

96
00:06:50,275 --> 00:06:51,711
[gasping]

97
00:06:52,977 --> 00:06:54,879
[young Theo whimpering]

98
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,118
[panting]

99
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,136
Try this on, Theo.
It's an old one of Platt's.

100
00:07:19,103 --> 00:07:20,872
It's so cold outside.

101
00:07:22,506 --> 00:07:23,975
[young Theo] Outside?

102
00:07:24,109 --> 00:07:26,979
I think you should
go back to school next week.

103
00:07:27,112 --> 00:07:30,114
The sooner we get back to
a normal routine the better.

104
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:34,086
Keeping busy
is the only thing for it.

105
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,489
Perhaps you could go
this afternoon?

106
00:07:39,023 --> 00:07:41,493
To your apartment.

107
00:07:41,626 --> 00:07:43,362
I could come with you.

108
00:07:54,538 --> 00:07:57,308
I meant to clean up
while I was waiting for her.

109
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,413
You get what you need.
I'll tidy this up.

110
00:08:02,547 --> 00:08:04,783
Just your school things.
The rest can wait.

111
00:08:07,785 --> 00:08:09,855
[sirens wailing in distance]

112
00:08:32,977 --> 00:08:34,478
[school bell ringing]

113
00:08:34,612 --> 00:08:36,046
[female announcer on PA]
<i>Also, basketball practice</i>

114
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,949
<i>has been moved
to 4:00 on Thursday.</i>

115
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,483
<i>Tickets for next week's
lacrosse final</i>

116
00:08:39,617 --> 00:08:41,420
<i>are available
in the admissions office.</i>

117
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:43,054
<i>Go Vikings!</i>

118
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:44,924
[indistinct chatter]

119
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,959
- Hey, Tom.
- Hey.

120
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,696
Uh... I heard and all.

121
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:52,797
Yeah.

122
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,632
Yeah, tough luck.

123
00:08:54,766 --> 00:08:56,200
That really bites.

124
00:08:56,334 --> 00:08:57,535
[young Theo] The only reason
we were at the museum

125
00:08:57,669 --> 00:08:59,103
was because my mom
was bringing me in

126
00:08:59,237 --> 00:09:00,706
to see the principal.

127
00:09:00,838 --> 00:09:02,141
About the cigarettes.

128
00:09:02,274 --> 00:09:05,410
Yeah. My mom blew up
over that shit, too.

129
00:09:06,978 --> 00:09:09,480
So, uh, I gotta go.

130
00:09:13,818 --> 00:09:15,154
Later.

131
00:09:18,022 --> 00:09:19,925
[girl] Where are you going?

132
00:09:20,058 --> 00:09:21,927
- [boy 1] Creep-io!
- [boy 2] Loser!

133
00:09:26,097 --> 00:09:29,201
I'm going to go swimming
every day.

134
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:32,371
You can't swim by yourself.
You're not allowed.

135
00:09:32,503 --> 00:09:33,838
[Mr. Barbour]
Everyone's going to swim.

136
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:37,208
The cure for anything
is salt water.

137
00:09:37,342 --> 00:09:39,778
Greatest gift my father
ever gave me was the sea.

138
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,612
The love for it.

139
00:09:41,979 --> 00:09:43,248
The feel.

140
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,886
What's he going to do
while we're away?

141
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,660
Who's the artist
I like, Samantha?

142
00:09:54,793 --> 00:09:56,727
With the grand skies?

143
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:58,130
[Mrs. Barbour]
Maxfield Parrish.

144
00:09:58,262 --> 00:09:59,931
[Mr. Barbour] Maxfield Parrish,
that's the one.

145
00:10:00,064 --> 00:10:01,967
Great towering clouds.

146
00:10:02,099 --> 00:10:03,667
When I was a boy
on the water,

147
00:10:03,801 --> 00:10:06,503
skies just like that. Magical.

148
00:10:06,637 --> 00:10:08,572
Red and orange sunsets.

149
00:10:09,006 --> 00:10:10,441
Arcadian.

150
00:10:16,548 --> 00:10:18,883
Oh. Best to leave that
to Esperenza, Theo.

151
00:10:19,016 --> 00:10:20,385
She's used to doing it.

152
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,453
And the same with your dishes.

153
00:10:26,591 --> 00:10:27,860
Oh.

154
00:10:27,992 --> 00:10:29,460
That is a lovely ring.

155
00:10:30,761 --> 00:10:32,097
Is it a family thing?

156
00:10:32,997 --> 00:10:34,432
Your mother's side?

157
00:10:36,334 --> 00:10:37,701
Yes.

158
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:40,238
Lovely. Carnelian.

159
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:42,406
The intaglio.

160
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:47,246
And the engraving
on the inside says,

161
00:10:49,881 --> 00:10:51,416
"Blackwell."

162
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,489
You should keep it
somewhere safe.

163
00:11:05,896 --> 00:11:07,366
I thought these might help.

164
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:09,434
If you take one at night,

165
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:11,737
it'll keep you
from feeling scared.

166
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,510
It's perfectly understandable.

167
00:11:19,844 --> 00:11:22,647
We all feel afraid sometimes.

168
00:11:27,986 --> 00:11:30,722
[detective 1] <i>We're just trying
to build up a general picture.</i>

169
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,391
<i>Little bits of the puzzle.</i>

170
00:11:32,524 --> 00:11:35,327
Now, how long would you say
you were in the museum

171
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:37,362
before the first explosion?

172
00:11:38,296 --> 00:11:39,697
About an hour.

173
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:41,064
[detective 1] Look at the map.

174
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:42,800
Where were you
when it happened?

175
00:11:42,934 --> 00:11:44,903
Which room were you in?

176
00:11:45,036 --> 00:11:47,739
The last one
before the gift shop.

177
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,441
[detective 2] 32.

178
00:11:50,574 --> 00:11:52,276
But your mother
wasn't with you?

179
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,594
No.

180
00:12:10,295 --> 00:12:12,830
She wanted to go back
and see a painting again.

181
00:12:12,963 --> 00:12:14,199
Which painting?

182
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,568
<i>The Anatomy Lesson.</i>

183
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,102
It's a Rembrandt.

184
00:12:19,636 --> 00:12:21,473
[detective 2]
Why didn't you go with her?

185
00:12:28,512 --> 00:12:29,614
Theo?

186
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:35,087
I said I'd meet her
in the gift shop.

187
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,727
What do you remember
about the incident?

188
00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:45,496
Move! Get out!

189
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,765
[detective 1]
Like, did you smell

190
00:12:46,897 --> 00:12:47,965
anything before it happened?

191
00:12:48,098 --> 00:12:49,434
I don't remember.

192
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:50,769
[detective 1]
Did you see anything unusual?

193
00:12:51,736 --> 00:12:52,703
I don't remember.

194
00:12:53,604 --> 00:12:54,806
[detective 1] Anything at all?

195
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:59,444
Where were you
when the blast happened? Here?

196
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:00,511
Or here?

197
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,216
I don't know.

198
00:13:04,348 --> 00:13:05,650
[detective 2] I know
all these rooms look alike

199
00:13:05,782 --> 00:13:08,752
but maybe if you could
remember where you were,

200
00:13:08,886 --> 00:13:10,421
we can start
to piece this thing together.

201
00:13:10,554 --> 00:13:11,723
[Mrs. Barbour]
I'm not sure I see the point

202
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:13,525
in putting him through
all of this.

203
00:13:15,193 --> 00:13:16,361
Theo hit his head.

204
00:13:17,462 --> 00:13:18,929
He has some memory impairment.

205
00:13:20,164 --> 00:13:23,235
Nobody seems to have thought
to ask if he was hurt or not.

206
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,671
Is that true?

207
00:13:31,075 --> 00:13:32,376
All right.

208
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:34,145
Afterwards,
when you came round,

209
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:36,115
did you see people?

210
00:13:36,881 --> 00:13:38,083
Yes.

211
00:13:38,216 --> 00:13:39,551
[detective 2]
What were they doing?

212
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:42,688
They were dead.

213
00:14:02,373 --> 00:14:03,707
[school bell rings]

214
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:05,710
- [door opens]
- [kids chattering]

215
00:14:05,843 --> 00:14:07,212
[door closes]

216
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:11,415
You told Beeman
the cigarettes were mine.

217
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,483
I was just standing
next to you!

218
00:14:13,851 --> 00:14:14,920
Jesus.

219
00:14:16,721 --> 00:14:17,890
[exhales]

220
00:14:20,324 --> 00:14:21,660
[grunts]

221
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:23,261
Get up!

222
00:14:35,106 --> 00:14:36,475
[door opens]

223
00:14:40,977 --> 00:14:43,582
Right. Okay.

224
00:14:44,782 --> 00:14:47,185
Are you absolutely sure
you wanna do that?

225
00:14:48,185 --> 00:14:49,186
Do what?

226
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,754
Your rook is in danger,

227
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:53,592
but I would suggest
you take a look at your queen.

228
00:15:00,265 --> 00:15:01,466
[sighs]

229
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,536
Sorry things are so fucked up.

230
00:15:08,205 --> 00:15:09,675
She was awfully nice.

231
00:16:41,665 --> 00:16:43,401
[doorbell buzzing]

232
00:16:44,935 --> 00:16:46,405
[exhales]

233
00:16:49,907 --> 00:16:51,442
[door unlocks]

234
00:16:55,112 --> 00:16:57,049
Excuse me, I, um...

235
00:16:58,815 --> 00:17:00,685
He told me to bring it here.

236
00:17:12,864 --> 00:17:14,031
I'm Hobie.

237
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:17,736
Come in.

238
00:17:20,905 --> 00:17:21,973
[door closes]

239
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:50,535
Is that him?

240
00:17:51,302 --> 00:17:52,703
The man who gave you the ring?

241
00:17:53,471 --> 00:17:55,138
Yes.

242
00:17:55,272 --> 00:17:57,007
His name was Welty Blackwell.

243
00:17:58,175 --> 00:17:59,677
He was my business partner.

244
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:03,781
Oh, he was the business,
really.

245
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:06,785
Handled the clients and sales.

246
00:18:15,393 --> 00:18:16,626
You...

247
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,363
You said he gave it to you?

248
00:18:19,496 --> 00:18:21,632
You mean in the gallery?
After...

249
00:18:26,436 --> 00:18:27,772
I'm glad he wasn't alone.

250
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:31,410
He would've hated that.

251
00:18:34,678 --> 00:18:36,046
You're the boy, aren't you?

252
00:18:37,715 --> 00:18:39,417
Whose mother was killed there?

253
00:18:46,323 --> 00:18:47,491
Have you eaten?

254
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:01,873
You like the family
you're staying with?

255
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,675
The Barbours?

256
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,379
It was in the papers.

257
00:19:08,512 --> 00:19:10,549
About her taking you in,
I mean.

258
00:19:11,848 --> 00:19:14,751
Orphan's plight type thing.

259
00:19:14,885 --> 00:19:17,021
I've done some work
for her family in the past.

260
00:19:20,258 --> 00:19:22,194
What's your favorite subject
in school?

261
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,129
English, I guess.

262
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,532
You have a favorite author?

263
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,001
Tolkien.

264
00:19:31,601 --> 00:19:33,737
Edgar Allan Poe.

265
00:19:33,871 --> 00:19:35,639
My dad says
he's second-rate though.

266
00:19:35,773 --> 00:19:39,010
He says he's the Vincent Price
of American letters.

267
00:19:39,143 --> 00:19:40,377
[chuckles]

268
00:19:40,511 --> 00:19:41,779
I don't think
that's fair though.

269
00:19:41,913 --> 00:19:43,515
No, I don't either.

270
00:19:46,082 --> 00:19:48,085
And where is he
in all this then?

271
00:19:48,752 --> 00:19:50,021
Your father?

272
00:19:50,654 --> 00:19:52,256
Oh, I don't know.

273
00:19:52,389 --> 00:19:53,691
He ditched us.

274
00:19:54,091 --> 00:19:55,259
[scoffs]

275
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:57,162
Good riddance.

276
00:19:57,294 --> 00:20:00,498
He could be okay sometimes,
I guess.

277
00:20:01,665 --> 00:20:03,166
He used to be an actor.

278
00:20:03,834 --> 00:20:06,337
And when we watched movies,

279
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,873
he used to tell me

280
00:20:08,005 --> 00:20:10,074
how they did
the special effects and all.

281
00:20:12,676 --> 00:20:14,812
But he drank.

282
00:20:17,315 --> 00:20:19,985
Like sometimes when he picked
me up from school and...

283
00:20:22,552 --> 00:20:25,589
Anyway, he's gone now.

284
00:20:28,693 --> 00:20:29,794
Well, you've pitched up

285
00:20:29,926 --> 00:20:31,228
with an interesting family
anyway.

286
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:43,308
[Welty] Now all that remains
is a handful of paintings.

287
00:20:44,742 --> 00:20:46,476
<i>The Goldfinch</i> is one of them.

288
00:20:47,611 --> 00:20:50,014
[young Pippa] It had to live
its whole life like that?

289
00:20:51,014 --> 00:20:52,182
Trapped?

290
00:20:59,623 --> 00:21:01,059
Is she here?

291
00:21:03,461 --> 00:21:04,863
[Hobie] Pippa?

292
00:21:10,167 --> 00:21:11,636
This is Theo.

293
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:13,171
He wants to say hello.

294
00:21:20,011 --> 00:21:21,745
Not too long, pigeon.

295
00:21:21,878 --> 00:21:23,280
You need to rest.

296
00:21:26,617 --> 00:21:27,886
[door closes]

297
00:21:28,485 --> 00:21:29,787
I know you.

298
00:21:30,654 --> 00:21:31,990
Are we friends?

299
00:21:33,157 --> 00:21:36,160
Sorry. I've forgotten things.

300
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,198
I didn't remember my room
when I came home.

301
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:53,345
What's your favorite piece
of music?

302
00:21:54,811 --> 00:21:56,780
Beethoven.

303
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:59,718
You look like somebody
who listens to Beethoven.

304
00:22:01,051 --> 00:22:02,686
Is that what you wanna do?

305
00:22:04,521 --> 00:22:05,723
Be a musician?

306
00:22:13,329 --> 00:22:15,066
I'm not supposed to
listen to music,

307
00:22:15,832 --> 00:22:17,234
'cause of my head.

308
00:22:17,801 --> 00:22:19,302
It's horrible.

309
00:22:19,436 --> 00:22:23,407
What Beethoven do you like?
I've got some Glenn Gould.

310
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,644
It's my favorite.

311
00:22:29,914 --> 00:22:31,281
It's medicine.

312
00:22:31,915 --> 00:22:33,350
I think it's morphine.

313
00:22:48,965 --> 00:22:51,335
- You get tired during the day?
- Yeah.

314
00:22:51,868 --> 00:22:53,203
I didn't use to.

315
00:22:53,604 --> 00:22:55,039
Me neither.

316
00:22:55,639 --> 00:22:57,708
Now, I can't stay awake.

317
00:22:58,276 --> 00:22:59,810
I'm sorry.

318
00:22:59,943 --> 00:23:01,345
I know it's rude,

319
00:23:01,478 --> 00:23:04,382
but would you mind if I just
close my eyes for a bit?

320
00:23:05,616 --> 00:23:08,019
You can listen to some music,
if you like.

321
00:23:21,232 --> 00:23:23,401
[music playing over earphones]

322
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,479
[Mrs. Barbour] You like it?

323
00:24:15,118 --> 00:24:16,887
John Singleton Copley.

324
00:24:18,355 --> 00:24:20,425
A great Colonial
portrait painter.

325
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:25,764
It was my grandmother's.

326
00:24:31,001 --> 00:24:33,738
She loved it, too.

327
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:36,306
[woman]
<i>Is this option two or three?</i>

328
00:24:36,807 --> 00:24:38,809
- Three.
- Okay.

329
00:24:38,943 --> 00:24:41,612
And now, how about
if this is choice five?

330
00:24:41,745 --> 00:24:43,079
Or choice six?

331
00:24:43,213 --> 00:24:44,448
[young Theo] <i>Six.</i>

332
00:26:07,763 --> 00:26:09,666
[cutlery clinking]

333
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,035
Why can't she listen to music?

334
00:26:14,605 --> 00:26:17,107
She can, sometimes.

335
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,111
It just tends to upset her.

336
00:26:21,244 --> 00:26:23,280
She thinks
she has to practice,

337
00:26:23,414 --> 00:26:25,816
prepare a piece for school.

338
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:30,221
They say that she could
play on some

339
00:26:30,354 --> 00:26:32,155
amateur level one day,

340
00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:37,028
but so many changes.

341
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:43,401
Her aunt is taking her
to Texas.

342
00:26:46,936 --> 00:26:48,438
I thought she lived here.

343
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:50,942
Well, she did.

344
00:26:53,844 --> 00:26:57,415
Welty was her uncle

345
00:26:57,548 --> 00:27:00,218
and her legal guardian,
after her mother died.

346
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:05,022
But now, Margaret is
Pippa's nearest relative.

347
00:27:06,924 --> 00:27:08,126
Blood, anyway.

348
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:13,164
And she thinks
she'd be better off with her.

349
00:27:16,399 --> 00:27:17,934
[young Theo] <i>What's she like?</i>

350
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:20,303
She seemed nice, I guess.

351
00:27:20,436 --> 00:27:23,241
She said she's got horses
and a swimming pool.

352
00:27:23,974 --> 00:27:25,342
I don't ride.

353
00:27:26,577 --> 00:27:27,679
Do you?

354
00:27:28,812 --> 00:27:30,047
No.

355
00:27:31,482 --> 00:27:32,583
My mom did.

356
00:27:32,715 --> 00:27:34,718
She used to have horses
growing up in Kansas.

357
00:27:34,851 --> 00:27:38,121
There was this one,
used to get so lonely,

358
00:27:39,388 --> 00:27:42,425
he would come and put his head
through the window

359
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,328
just to see what was going on.

360
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:49,334
Is your mother dead too?

361
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:52,971
Yes.

362
00:27:54,905 --> 00:27:56,240
Did yours get sick?

363
00:27:57,007 --> 00:27:58,176
No.

364
00:27:59,742 --> 00:28:02,046
Will you stay
with the family you're with?

365
00:28:02,512 --> 00:28:04,146
No.

366
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,216
They're all going away
for the summer.

367
00:28:07,851 --> 00:28:09,152
Then what?

368
00:28:10,721 --> 00:28:11,756
I don't know.

369
00:28:16,393 --> 00:28:18,196
I wish you weren't going.

370
00:28:26,503 --> 00:28:28,305
Do you remember seeing me?

371
00:28:30,607 --> 00:28:31,742
When?

372
00:28:33,243 --> 00:28:34,578
[young Theo] Right before.

373
00:28:35,979 --> 00:28:37,482
I remember you.

374
00:28:38,948 --> 00:28:40,250
I was there.

375
00:28:45,556 --> 00:28:46,723
I was there.

376
00:28:47,857 --> 00:28:50,227
[Hobie] You should get
some rest, pigeon.

377
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:54,064
And I, uh... I told Theo
I'd show him the workshop.

378
00:29:05,142 --> 00:29:07,045
[old-timey music playing
on record]

379
00:29:14,283 --> 00:29:16,053
[Hobie] You like old things.

380
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:18,388
[chuckles softly]

381
00:29:18,521 --> 00:29:21,325
Must be interesting for you
at the Barbours' then.

382
00:29:21,457 --> 00:29:25,095
The Chippendale? Queen Anne?

383
00:29:27,598 --> 00:29:31,402
It's nicer here.
You can see how they're made.

384
00:29:31,534 --> 00:29:34,036
At the Barbours',
they all kind of

385
00:29:34,171 --> 00:29:35,806
look like stuffed animals.

386
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,308
[Hobie laughs]

387
00:29:39,109 --> 00:29:41,745
You can help me sort through
these cherrywood veneers.

388
00:29:44,481 --> 00:29:47,452
Looking to match the case
for this clock here.

389
00:30:03,032 --> 00:30:04,769
Theo, you remember Platt.

390
00:30:10,973 --> 00:30:12,076
Who do I have to blow to get

391
00:30:12,209 --> 00:30:13,644
a cup of coffee
around this place?

392
00:30:15,444 --> 00:30:16,879
Go back to your room.

393
00:30:17,013 --> 00:30:18,281
Chance, just...

394
00:30:18,415 --> 00:30:20,184
No. Not this time.
Go back to your room.

395
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:22,453
Now!

396
00:30:24,186 --> 00:30:25,289
[chair clatters]

397
00:30:28,892 --> 00:30:30,026
[door slams shut]

398
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:31,795
[loud rock music playing]

399
00:30:31,928 --> 00:30:33,796
[young Andy]
<i>Something happened at school.</i>

400
00:30:33,931 --> 00:30:34,965
Something bad.

401
00:30:35,098 --> 00:30:36,098
Has he been expelled?

402
00:30:36,232 --> 00:30:37,702
No one will talk about it.

403
00:30:39,302 --> 00:30:40,670
Mother loves Platt the best.

404
00:30:41,504 --> 00:30:43,206
Daddy loves Kitsey best.

405
00:30:45,842 --> 00:30:47,344
Mother loves Platt.

406
00:30:50,947 --> 00:30:52,682
She loves Toddy a lot, too.

407
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:16,273
[old-timey music playing
on record]

408
00:31:26,082 --> 00:31:27,517
[Hobie clears throat]

409
00:31:37,494 --> 00:31:38,929
I can't tell.

410
00:31:40,297 --> 00:31:44,268
Well, one way
is to check the wear.

411
00:31:45,635 --> 00:31:49,973
If it's too even, like here,
then it's reproduction.

412
00:31:53,277 --> 00:31:56,414
Antiques always wear
asymmetrically.

413
00:32:01,751 --> 00:32:05,455
Another thing, here, this.

414
00:32:07,089 --> 00:32:08,291
It's machine-cut.

415
00:32:09,792 --> 00:32:11,194
You feel it?

416
00:32:11,328 --> 00:32:12,863
[imitates machine whirring]

417
00:32:13,597 --> 00:32:15,665
- Hmm.
- But here,

418
00:32:17,901 --> 00:32:18,903
hand-planed.

419
00:32:25,943 --> 00:32:27,042
So this one is fake.

420
00:32:27,176 --> 00:32:28,712
[chuckles] Well, no.

421
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:31,714
It's only fake if you try to
pass it off as an original.

422
00:32:31,848 --> 00:32:36,020
This is a reproduction
and not a very good one.

423
00:32:36,153 --> 00:32:38,923
There are things you can do
to help the reimagining.

424
00:32:39,056 --> 00:32:43,894
Period wood, acid,
gold size, lampblack.

425
00:32:44,027 --> 00:32:47,530
You can rust old nails
in salt water.

426
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,302
You'll get a feel for it.

427
00:32:53,203 --> 00:32:56,773
The new one's flat. It's dead.

428
00:32:58,008 --> 00:32:59,277
But this one...

429
00:33:02,846 --> 00:33:03,847
That glow.

430
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:09,887
That's hundreds of years
of being touched, used.

431
00:33:12,188 --> 00:33:13,423
That's life.

432
00:33:34,744 --> 00:33:36,347
What do you know about Texas?

433
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,749
You can't walk anywhere

434
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:40,484
and they have
the death penalty.

435
00:33:42,351 --> 00:33:43,919
But it'll be better
for her there.

436
00:33:44,754 --> 00:33:47,223
The climate is good
for convalescents.

437
00:33:47,357 --> 00:33:48,925
She should go
to the planetarium.

438
00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:50,560
Although it's inferior
to the Hayden.

439
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:55,799
Do you wanna go get a burger?

440
00:33:56,867 --> 00:33:58,468
I thought you were
watching your weight,

441
00:33:58,601 --> 00:33:59,869
so you'd fit
into your prom dress.

442
00:34:04,073 --> 00:34:06,009
Oh. Oh. Oh.

443
00:34:06,143 --> 00:34:07,444
[both] Oh!

444
00:34:07,577 --> 00:34:09,011
Well, I've been making
a corsage for your dress

445
00:34:09,144 --> 00:34:10,980
and it goes
a little something like this!

446
00:34:11,414 --> 00:34:12,582
[both chuckle]

447
00:34:12,716 --> 00:34:14,452
[muffled laughter]

448
00:34:18,354 --> 00:34:19,589
[Mrs. Barbour] <i>Theo...</i>

449
00:34:20,223 --> 00:34:21,758
<i>I have a proposal for you.</i>

450
00:34:22,892 --> 00:34:25,161
<i>Would you like to come
to Maine with us this year?</i>

451
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:28,064
Yes! Please! That would be...

452
00:34:28,597 --> 00:34:30,332
Yes, please.

453
00:34:30,466 --> 00:34:32,836
Good. We'll see
how you like sailing.

454
00:34:35,071 --> 00:34:38,407
You think it's going
to be fun, but you'll hate it.

455
00:34:38,542 --> 00:34:40,244
How come they decided
to ask me?

456
00:34:40,743 --> 00:34:42,245
Don't be a dunce.

457
00:34:42,379 --> 00:34:43,881
They've grown
quite fond of you.

458
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:45,749
I think they might make

459
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:46,984
a family announcement
in Maine.

460
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,419
Announcement?

461
00:34:49,553 --> 00:34:51,088
I think they might
wanna keep ya.

462
00:34:51,655 --> 00:34:52,955
[chuckles]

463
00:34:54,024 --> 00:34:55,926
[young Theo]
<i>Andy says we'll be sick.</i>

464
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:59,129
He has to carry a baggie
on board just to throw up in.

465
00:34:59,261 --> 00:35:00,363
[Hobie chuckles]

466
00:35:00,497 --> 00:35:02,499
I'm afraid I'm the same way.

467
00:35:02,631 --> 00:35:05,501
You might just discover
you wanna be a sailor

468
00:35:05,635 --> 00:35:09,607
or a marine biologist.

469
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,611
You never know what's going
to decide your future.

470
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,325
I got deck shoes,
like you said.

471
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,060
And I got a sweater.

472
00:35:30,526 --> 00:35:31,729
Theo...

473
00:35:32,896 --> 00:35:35,165
I have a surprise for you.

474
00:35:44,807 --> 00:35:46,208
[Larry] Hey, buddy.

475
00:35:46,341 --> 00:35:47,677
Long time no see.

476
00:35:49,078 --> 00:35:50,080
Hi.

477
00:35:50,847 --> 00:35:54,183
I'm Xandra. With an "X."

478
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:57,354
So we just got into LaGuardia
about two hours ago.

479
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,856
I'm out in Las Vegas
now and, uh...

480
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:02,193
Well, things are
pretty different for me.

481
00:36:15,104 --> 00:36:17,039
[sighs] Son, we're straight
off the plane.

482
00:36:17,173 --> 00:36:18,707
And, uh, well,
we wanted to see you

483
00:36:18,841 --> 00:36:20,109
straight away, of course,

484
00:36:20,243 --> 00:36:22,112
but also need the key
to the apartment.

485
00:36:22,245 --> 00:36:24,314
Yeah, we couldn't get
in there. We tried already.

486
00:36:24,446 --> 00:36:26,749
[Larry] Yeah, I'm here
to start taking care of stuff.

487
00:36:26,883 --> 00:36:28,819
[Xandra] You should be
proud of your pops.

488
00:36:28,952 --> 00:36:30,854
Fifty-one days sober.

489
00:36:31,421 --> 00:36:32,455
Did it all on his own.

490
00:36:32,589 --> 00:36:34,057
Detoxed on the sofa,

491
00:36:34,191 --> 00:36:36,493
basket of Easter candy
and Valium.

492
00:36:36,626 --> 00:36:38,328
Because I couldn't take it.

493
00:36:38,461 --> 00:36:39,562
My mom's the kind of lush

494
00:36:39,696 --> 00:36:40,730
who would throw up
in her own glass

495
00:36:40,863 --> 00:36:42,800
and then drink it anyway.

496
00:36:42,932 --> 00:36:44,466
[Larry] I guess
I should have called, but...

497
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,803
Well, I figured it was easier
just to come and get you.

498
00:36:49,673 --> 00:36:50,841
Get me?

499
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:58,114
You got a nice
little place here.

500
00:36:58,247 --> 00:36:59,883
[Larry] No,
it's more hers than mine.

501
00:37:06,656 --> 00:37:08,025
What do you got there?

502
00:37:11,227 --> 00:37:12,495
A picture.

503
00:37:12,629 --> 00:37:15,566
No, I told ya. Don't haul
a lot of junk, all right?

504
00:37:15,698 --> 00:37:17,700
You know, the movers
will bring most of it.

505
00:37:21,437 --> 00:37:24,307
You know, your mother wasn't
so easy to get along with.

506
00:37:26,276 --> 00:37:29,312
[sighs] But there's two sides
to every marriage, you know?

507
00:37:30,814 --> 00:37:33,017
And she sure could
hold a grudge.

508
00:37:39,955 --> 00:37:43,026
But God knows
she didn't deserve...

"Desert End Road."

510
00:37:50,367 --> 00:37:53,803
It's like you're moving to
some mining colony on Jupiter.

511
00:37:53,937 --> 00:37:55,072
I wonder
if your school will be

512
00:37:55,205 --> 00:37:57,274
one those places
you read about

513
00:37:57,406 --> 00:38:00,176
with gangs, metal detectors.

514
00:38:07,783 --> 00:38:09,953
Okay. We're off.

515
00:38:10,086 --> 00:38:12,055
[Mrs. Barbour]
Have a good trip, all of you.

516
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:20,297
Goodbye, Theo.

517
00:38:24,801 --> 00:38:26,837
You were
an awfully good guest.

518
00:39:09,278 --> 00:39:10,280

Hey, wake up, buddy.

522
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,825
Come on,
you're holding up the line.

523
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:23,794
Jeez, he's as white
as a sheet.

524
00:39:25,194 --> 00:39:29,133
Why don't you give him
one of those? You know?

525
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,176
Here, this'll help.

526
00:39:45,347 --> 00:39:46,249
Shoes.

527
00:40:46,843 --> 00:40:49,011
[loud whining]

528
00:40:52,582 --> 00:40:53,817
What is that?

529
00:40:54,484 --> 00:40:55,652
That's her dog.

530
00:40:55,785 --> 00:40:57,287
[Xandra] Popper,
you get back here.

531
00:40:57,419 --> 00:40:58,921
- He stayed by himself?
- [Popper barking]

532
00:40:59,055 --> 00:40:59,955
[Xandra] Come here!

533
00:41:00,089 --> 00:41:01,357
He's got a water fountain.

534
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:03,959
Grab these other bags,
will you?

535
00:41:04,093 --> 00:41:06,428
Pop! Would you...
Larry, get the dog.

536
00:41:06,763 --> 00:41:07,997
Popper!

537
00:41:08,131 --> 00:41:10,033

- [Xandra] Popper!

538
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:12,803

he's shit all over the floor!

00:41:12,935 --> 00:41:15,372

I can see that, Larry?

540
00:41:15,872 --> 00:41:17,339
Popper, come here.

541
00:41:17,973 --> 00:41:20,008
Damn it, I stepped in it.

542
00:41:20,142 --> 00:41:22,345
[conversation continues
indistinctly]

543
00:42:20,169 --> 00:42:22,037
I thought he'd stopped?

544
00:42:22,472 --> 00:42:23,473
[Xandra] Hmm?

545
00:42:24,874 --> 00:42:28,010
Oh. That's just a beer.

546
00:42:28,144 --> 00:42:29,879
He doesn't touch
the hard stuff anymore.

547
00:42:32,314 --> 00:42:34,017
Take the trash out, will you?

548
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:36,486
[young Theo] Where does it go?

549
00:42:37,287 --> 00:42:38,620
There's a house
down the street

550
00:42:38,754 --> 00:42:40,490
with a dumpster outside.
Just stick it in there.

551
00:42:41,857 --> 00:42:43,026
Won't they mind?

552
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:45,328
Who?

553
00:42:46,028 --> 00:42:47,362
We're the only ones here.

554
00:42:48,363 --> 00:42:50,566
[TV continues playing
indistinctly]

555
00:43:07,716 --> 00:43:09,086
[dog barking in distance]

556
00:43:53,729 --> 00:43:55,097
[gasps]

557
00:43:59,702 --> 00:44:02,338
[adult Theo]
<i>I wear bespoke suits.</i>

558
00:44:04,006 --> 00:44:06,075
<i>I swim twice a week.</i>

559
00:44:07,477 --> 00:44:10,314
<i>I socialize with people
I can't stand.</i>

560
00:44:11,881 --> 00:44:13,215
<i>I'm relaxed...</i>

561
00:44:14,751 --> 00:44:16,053
<i>personable.</i>

562
00:44:17,452 --> 00:44:19,422
<i>I don't indulge in self-pity.</i>

563
00:44:20,789 --> 00:44:22,525
<i>It's true what I read.</i>

564
00:44:23,859 --> 00:44:25,127
<i>We're so accustomed</i>

565
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,129
<i>to disguise ourselves
to others,</i>

566
00:44:28,765 --> 00:44:31,001
<i>that in the end,</i>

567
00:44:31,133 --> 00:44:33,302
<i>we become disguised
to ourselves.</i>

568
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:41,511
[adult Theo] Warmer.

569
00:44:44,546 --> 00:44:45,548
Warmer.

570
00:44:47,984 --> 00:44:49,186
Warmer.

571
00:44:54,256 --> 00:44:57,059
- Yes.
- [stammers] Really?

572
00:44:57,193 --> 00:44:59,194
No, but it's so beautiful.

573
00:44:59,729 --> 00:45:00,931
How would you know?

574
00:45:01,064 --> 00:45:02,464
Most people wouldn't.

575
00:45:02,597 --> 00:45:04,099
I've seen pieces
he's worked on

576
00:45:04,232 --> 00:45:06,236
that I could've sworn
were completely genuine.

577
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:10,740
This is genuine
Connecticut Queen Anne.

578
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:14,077
But the pediment
and the legs were damaged,

579
00:45:14,209 --> 00:45:17,545
so the finials and the legs

580
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,482
were salvaged
from a different piece.

581
00:45:23,151 --> 00:45:24,420
What? These?

582
00:45:25,421 --> 00:45:26,490
Mmm-hmm.

583
00:45:29,892 --> 00:45:30,894
You feel that?

584
00:45:31,026 --> 00:45:32,229
Yeah.

585
00:45:34,664 --> 00:45:35,665
Wow.

586
00:45:35,798 --> 00:45:37,066
And...

587
00:45:38,568 --> 00:45:39,602
here.

588
00:45:40,937 --> 00:45:42,272
You feel that?

589
00:45:42,972 --> 00:45:44,341
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

590
00:45:46,142 --> 00:45:47,644
[Everett]
What are we looking at?

591
00:45:47,776 --> 00:45:49,713
Oh, come and see
what Hobie made, Everett.

592
00:45:49,845 --> 00:45:51,113
Oh, I didn't make it.

593
00:45:51,247 --> 00:45:53,550
I just patched
the poor thing up.

594
00:45:53,682 --> 00:45:55,417
Not worth much now,
of course,

595
00:45:55,551 --> 00:45:56,786
but maybe we can
find a home for it.

596
00:45:56,919 --> 00:45:59,122
What do you think, Pip?
Shall we take it?

597
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,357
[scoffs] It's bigger
than our bedroom.

598
00:46:02,959 --> 00:46:04,461
[Hobie] I'm gonna take
these two to lunch

599
00:46:04,593 --> 00:46:05,828
and then on to the airport.

600
00:46:05,961 --> 00:46:07,229
What?
Can't you come with us?

601
00:46:08,497 --> 00:46:09,598
Oh.

602
00:46:09,731 --> 00:46:12,200
No, no, I can't.
I have a client meeting, so...

603
00:46:12,334 --> 00:46:14,936
You're such a businessman
these days.

604
00:46:15,071 --> 00:46:16,640
Well, one of us has to be.

605
00:46:17,406 --> 00:46:18,841
All right, let's go.

606
00:46:18,975 --> 00:46:22,379
Yes. Uh, well, it was
so lovely to see you again.

607
00:46:23,812 --> 00:46:25,914
It was great
to finally meet you, Theo.

608
00:46:26,048 --> 00:46:28,016
If you're ever in London,
come and stay with us.

609
00:46:28,151 --> 00:46:31,553
She was exaggerating about
the size of the flat sort of.

610
00:46:31,687 --> 00:46:32,856
[both chuckle]

611
00:46:48,638 --> 00:46:50,140
[Lucius] <i>I can recommend
the poularde.</i>

612
00:46:51,307 --> 00:46:52,509
That's fine. Thank you.

613
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:56,145
- Thank you.
- [waiter] Very good, sir.

614
00:46:56,278 --> 00:46:57,746
This is a pleasant surprise,
Mr. Reeve.

615
00:46:58,214 --> 00:46:59,582
Lucius, please.

616
00:46:59,716 --> 00:47:01,450
Are you looking
for another piece to buy?

617
00:47:01,584 --> 00:47:04,287
I want to talk about the piece
you've already sold me.

618
00:47:04,819 --> 00:47:05,722
The Affleck?

619
00:47:06,756 --> 00:47:08,792
- It is beautiful, isn't it?
- Yes.

620
00:47:08,925 --> 00:47:10,861
Except that it isn't, is it?

621
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:12,962
Thomas Affleck, I mean.

622
00:47:13,095 --> 00:47:16,264
The phoenix ornament is.
I'm fairly certain about that.

623
00:47:16,399 --> 00:47:19,736
But the rest
of the chest is not.

624
00:47:21,303 --> 00:47:24,273
Antique but unremarkable.

625
00:47:25,573 --> 00:47:28,144
Mr. Reeve, I can assure you

626
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:29,412
that if there's been
a mistake...

627
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:31,647
Oh, but there has been,
Mr. Decker.

628
00:47:31,781 --> 00:47:36,153
You sold a fake to someone
who can tell the difference.

629
00:47:36,986 --> 00:47:38,721
To be honest,

630
00:47:38,854 --> 00:47:40,789
I am still quite new
at all this

631
00:47:40,923 --> 00:47:43,859
and I am certainly
not an expert

632
00:47:43,993 --> 00:47:45,162
at Philadelphia Chippendale.

633
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,198
Here's the problem.

634
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:50,533
I know exactly who put

635
00:47:50,665 --> 00:47:52,635
the little Frankenstein's
monster together

636
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:54,770
that you sold me.
Your partner.

637
00:47:54,903 --> 00:47:56,405
My partner had nothing
to do with this.

638
00:47:56,539 --> 00:47:57,673
Oh, I think he did.

639
00:47:57,807 --> 00:47:59,308
I've seen
his handiwork before.

640
00:47:59,441 --> 00:48:01,177
"Changelings."

641
00:48:02,745 --> 00:48:04,547
That's what he calls 'em,
isn't it?

642
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:07,949
A pair of finials from here,
a set of legs from there.

643
00:48:08,084 --> 00:48:10,752
Just enough of a genuinely
collectable piece

644
00:48:10,886 --> 00:48:12,754
to fool the buyer, and <i>voilà.</i>

645
00:48:12,888 --> 00:48:16,692
I'm happy to buy the piece
back from you, Mr. Reeve.

646
00:48:16,825 --> 00:48:18,327
At a premium.

647
00:48:19,095 --> 00:48:20,029
I don't see what else I...

648
00:48:20,162 --> 00:48:21,930
- I know you.
- What?

649
00:48:22,064 --> 00:48:24,732
I've been in this business
for a long time.

650
00:48:24,867 --> 00:48:27,370
We all know poor Hobie
was going under,

651
00:48:27,502 --> 00:48:28,638
swimming in debt.

652
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:32,275
Then along you come,
the wunderkind.

653
00:48:32,408 --> 00:48:35,276
The knowledgeable,
charming young salesman.

654
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:38,213
Suddenly the business
is thriving.

655
00:48:38,347 --> 00:48:41,818
But I know you, Mr. Decker.

656
00:48:46,088 --> 00:48:47,823
I know all about you.

657
00:48:54,229 --> 00:48:55,432
Theo?

658
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,502
It's Platt.

659
00:49:00,269 --> 00:49:01,470
Platt Barbour.

660
00:49:02,303 --> 00:49:04,439
Platt. Good Lord.

661
00:49:05,207 --> 00:49:07,109
Long time.
How are you?

662
00:49:07,243 --> 00:49:08,411
How's Andy?

663
00:49:11,948 --> 00:49:13,682
[adult Platt]
<i>You know how Daddy had...</i>

664
00:49:13,816 --> 00:49:16,285
<i>They used to call it
"problems with his nerves."</i>

665
00:49:17,919 --> 00:49:18,988
Bipolar.

666
00:49:20,055 --> 00:49:21,723
I didn't know.

667
00:49:21,857 --> 00:49:23,892
He was always
very kind with me.

668
00:49:24,026 --> 00:49:25,395
Yeah.

669
00:49:25,528 --> 00:49:29,633
A few years back,
he came off his medication.

670
00:49:32,234 --> 00:49:34,104
You know how he loved sailing.

671
00:49:34,236 --> 00:49:37,539
He decided to go out
off the Northeast Harbor.

672
00:49:38,307 --> 00:49:39,609
I went with him.

673
00:49:40,042 --> 00:49:41,376
Andy came too,

674
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:43,612
just in case Daddy got
storm giddy, you know?

675
00:49:45,481 --> 00:49:47,550
[sighs] Of course,
Andy didn't wanna go.

676
00:49:48,584 --> 00:49:50,453
He always hated the water.

677
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,756
Anyway, the wind blew up

678
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:56,725
and we were trying
to reef the mainsail

679
00:49:57,794 --> 00:50:00,263
and Daddy started just...

680
00:50:00,396 --> 00:50:03,033
shouting all this
poetic bullshit.

681
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,536
Next thing, he's overboard

682
00:50:06,669 --> 00:50:08,604
and we're trying
to haul him back in.

683
00:50:11,006 --> 00:50:12,775
And we get broadsided.

684
00:50:14,276 --> 00:50:15,944
This big wave just...

685
00:50:22,151 --> 00:50:23,419
And they both went.

686
00:50:29,925 --> 00:50:32,361
Andy hadn't tied
his jacket on properly.

687
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,700
He's always
such a fucking klutz.

688
00:50:43,571 --> 00:50:44,774
God, Platt.

689
00:50:52,381 --> 00:50:53,950
Do something for me?

690
00:51:36,725 --> 00:51:37,961
[adult Platt] She's back here.

691
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:43,533
We're very informal now.

692
00:51:46,435 --> 00:51:48,337
[knocks on door]

693
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:51,573
Mom? I've got a guest for you.

694
00:52:02,417 --> 00:52:03,620
Mrs. Barbour?

695
00:52:10,359 --> 00:52:11,561
Theo.

696
00:52:16,798 --> 00:52:18,434
I can't believe it.

697
00:52:20,669 --> 00:52:22,271
<i>So handsome.</i>

698
00:52:22,403 --> 00:52:24,840
Isn't he, Platt? Hmm?

699
00:52:25,406 --> 00:52:26,609
Yeah.

700
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:30,146
Now, you must tell me,

701
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:32,948
what have you been doing
with your life?

702
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:36,018
Uh... Dealing antiques.

703
00:52:36,151 --> 00:52:37,453
[inhales sharply]

704
00:52:37,586 --> 00:52:41,389
Antiques. How marvelous, Theo.

705
00:52:41,524 --> 00:52:43,425
American furniture mostly.

706
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:44,928
You should come by.

707
00:52:45,827 --> 00:52:48,030
You know
how I love old things.

708
00:52:48,162 --> 00:52:50,098
When you were a child,
I used to catch you

709
00:52:50,231 --> 00:52:51,533
studying my paintings.

710
00:52:51,667 --> 00:52:53,569
You'd always go straight
to the very best ones.

711
00:52:53,702 --> 00:52:56,905
The Peale, the Lane,
the Copley.

712
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:01,211
I used to think,
"Oh! A kindred spirit."

713
00:53:03,511 --> 00:53:04,879
Mrs. Barbour...

714
00:53:05,513 --> 00:53:07,282
I didn't know about Andy.

715
00:53:07,415 --> 00:53:09,618
- Hmm.
- I can't believe it.

716
00:53:10,519 --> 00:53:12,054
I am so sorry.

717
00:53:14,823 --> 00:53:17,126
I don't need to tell you
about loss.

718
00:53:21,664 --> 00:53:23,932
You were always

1077

1078

She's always gone.

It's not secret.

1080
01:14:41,376 --> 01:14:44,780
She won't see me
because it was my fault.

1081
01:14:47,382 --> 01:14:50,752
She was taking me
to see the principal

1082
01:14:50,886 --> 01:14:54,356
because they'd said
I'd been smoking.

1083
01:14:55,891 --> 01:14:59,161
And it was raining,
and we were early

1084
01:15:00,494 --> 01:15:03,964
and that's why we went
into the museum.

1085

It was my fault she died.

1086

to do is,

You tell him that I'm sending
you to a private school

transferred to this account.

As long as the money's
being used for your benefit,

And this restaurant,

it'll be
for all of our benefits.

Thing is,
if we angle this right?

1165

for this right now.

will close back East.

to sign documents,

you tell him to fax
to this number, okay?

[TV playing indistinctly]

1252
01:28:24,431 --> 01:28:25,633
What are you doing?

1253
01:28:28,168 --> 01:28:31,571
I didn't think
you could see me.

1254
01:28:31,704 --> 01:28:32,973
You're too young to drink.

1255
01:28:33,841 --> 01:28:35,008
Apologies.

1256
01:28:39,879 --> 01:28:41,748
[both laughing]

1257
01:28:48,454 --> 01:28:49,789
What's wrong with you?

1258
01:28:50,324 --> 01:28:51,357
[snorts]

1259
01:28:51,691 --> 01:28:52,792
[laughs]

1260
01:28:52,926 --> 01:28:55,129
What is wrong with you?

1261
01:28:56,363 --> 01:28:59,199
You can't cry?
Your father is dead.

1262
01:28:59,332 --> 01:29:00,867
Your own father.

1263
01:29:01,001 --> 01:29:02,936
Oh, you think it's funny?

1264
01:29:03,070 --> 01:29:04,939
Yeah, well,
let me tell you something.

1265
01:29:06,472 --> 01:29:09,709
You might not have had
a lot of time for your dad,

1266
01:29:09,842 --> 01:29:12,078
but you are his kid...

1267
01:29:13,780 --> 01:29:15,783
[chuckling]
through and through.

1268
01:29:26,793 --> 01:29:28,162
[exhales sharply]

1269
01:29:38,905 --> 01:29:40,372
They've gone.

1270
01:29:40,507 --> 01:29:41,776
And she's out cold.

1271
01:29:41,909 --> 01:29:44,344
- What are you doing?
- I'm looking for money.

1272
01:29:44,477 --> 01:29:47,247
I'm leaving before people
start showing up.

1273
01:29:47,948 --> 01:29:49,482
- Come with me.
- Where?

1274
01:29:49,617 --> 01:29:51,351
- New York.
- What?

1275
01:29:51,485 --> 01:29:52,986
I can't stay here with her.

1276
01:29:53,119 --> 01:29:54,520
Because of what she said?

1277
01:29:54,654 --> 01:29:55,888
She's a mess, Potter.

1278
01:29:56,021 --> 01:29:57,725
I feel sorry for her.

1279
01:30:04,897 --> 01:30:06,100
Don't.

1280
01:30:07,234 --> 01:30:09,503
We should plan this.
Crazy to go tonight.

1281
01:30:09,636 --> 01:30:11,205
I can't stay here!

1282
01:30:11,337 --> 01:30:13,739
She'll put me in a home.
You understand that?

1283
01:30:13,873 --> 01:30:15,142
Look, I'm a minor.

1284
01:30:15,275 --> 01:30:17,845
I've got no family,
no friends out here.

1285
01:30:18,846 --> 01:30:20,180
We have to go.

1286
01:30:20,314 --> 01:30:21,315
Now.

1287
01:30:37,029 --> 01:30:38,732
What about Popchik?

1288
01:30:45,138 --> 01:30:46,640
We'll stop at yours,
grab your things,

1289
01:30:46,774 --> 01:30:47,975
and then go
to the bus station.

1290
01:30:48,107 --> 01:30:50,410
I can't leave now.
Give me more time.

1291
01:30:50,543 --> 01:30:53,747
What? I don't have time.
They'll come for me.

1292
01:30:53,879 --> 01:30:55,548
- Just one day.
- Why?

1293
01:30:55,681 --> 01:30:56,682
Because I...

1294
01:30:56,816 --> 01:30:58,217
Because what?

1295
01:30:59,418 --> 01:31:01,788
There's something important
I have to tell you.

1296
01:31:03,522 --> 01:31:05,124
Boris, what?

1297
01:31:05,257 --> 01:31:06,926
What do you have to tell me?

1298
01:31:10,363 --> 01:31:13,232
You shouldn't go.
It's a mistake.

1299
01:31:13,367 --> 01:31:14,935
I have to go.

1300
01:31:15,068 --> 01:31:17,003
Now, are you coming or not?

1301
01:31:19,006 --> 01:31:20,207
You go ahead.

1302
01:31:20,873 --> 01:31:22,075
I'll follow.

1303
01:31:22,676 --> 01:31:24,044
One or two days.

1304
01:31:26,145 --> 01:31:29,482
You have to come. Promise me.

1305
01:31:29,615 --> 01:31:30,917
We'll go to Brighton Beach.

1306
01:31:31,051 --> 01:31:32,318
That's where all of
the Russians hang out.

1307
01:31:32,452 --> 01:31:33,619
And we can go
to school together.

1308
01:31:33,753 --> 01:31:34,687
Potter.

1309
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:35,989
And...

1310
01:31:41,294 --> 01:31:42,462
Good luck.

1311
01:31:43,730 --> 01:31:45,832

Chinois china
or Birds of the Nile?

1353
01:35:24,550 --> 01:35:26,285
It wasn't quite as romantic
as I hoped it would be.

1354
01:35:26,418 --> 01:35:28,454
They're beautiful.

1355

What?

1356
01:35:32,292 --> 01:35:34,260
No, nothing.
They're gorgeous.

1357
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:36,629
It's just,
do you think they'll be

1358
01:35:36,763 --> 01:35:39,499
quite right
for the actual day?

1359
01:35:41,501 --> 01:35:42,735
No.

really my stone.

Kitsey said
no speeches today,

1371

[Mrs. Barbour] No. You'll never
ever believe this,

1379
01:36:27,613 --> 01:36:31,050
but I saw this show in Boston
when I was in college.

Forrest Longstreet.

1383
01:36:42,294 --> 01:36:44,163
He was in Andy's class,
wasn't he?

1384
01:36:44,297 --> 01:36:45,799
That's right.

1385
01:36:45,932 --> 01:36:49,168
He didn't invite Andy to
a birthday party, I remember.

1386
01:36:49,302 --> 01:36:51,371
I don't think
Andy would've wanted to go.

1387
01:36:55,408 --> 01:36:56,810
Perhaps not.

1388
01:36:59,812 --> 01:37:01,614
You knew him
better than I did.

1389
01:37:03,083 --> 01:37:07,521
I don't think I ever saw him
for... [sighs] what he was.

1390
01:37:07,654 --> 01:37:11,892
I think I was always trying to
make him into someone else.

1391
01:37:17,262 --> 01:37:18,531
After he'd gone...

1392
01:37:20,132 --> 01:37:23,569
[sighs] I thought everything
would be broken forever.

1393
01:37:26,373 --> 01:37:28,175
And then you came back.

1394
01:37:33,512 --> 01:37:36,350
And I thought I'd never be
quite so happy ever again.

if I speak from the heart,

1398
01:37:46,793 --> 01:37:49,763
but I always did think of you
as one of my own.

1399
01:37:55,802 --> 01:37:58,738
I know this must have been
distressing for you.

1400
01:37:58,872 --> 01:38:01,908
So I'd like to offer you
some compensation.

1401
01:38:02,042 --> 01:38:03,810
Say, an additional 10,000?

1402

01:38:11,016 --> 01:38:13,185
I know you were there

1405
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:16,657

was in that room.

what you're talking about.

in room 32.

01:38:36,743 --> 01:38:39,479
hadn't gone around
telling half the town

1414
01:38:39,611 --> 01:38:41,948
how you turned up at his door
with Welty's ring,

1415
01:38:42,082 --> 01:38:44,751
I might never have
made the connection.

What connection?

to Mr. Hobart,

made you his ward.

- I'm not his...
- Or whatever you are to him.

have been farming out,

01:39:03,136 --> 01:39:05,405
This painting.

1424
01:39:06,806 --> 01:39:09,576
Fabritius' <i>The Goldfinch.</i>

1425
01:39:09,708 --> 01:39:12,878
Destroyed in a mindless
terrorist attack

1426
01:39:13,012 --> 01:39:14,547
on a New York museum.

1427
01:39:14,680 --> 01:39:17,417
Oh, poor, brave little bird.

1428
01:39:19,285 --> 01:39:20,921
Lost forever.

1429
01:39:24,857 --> 01:39:26,859
You've been
irresponsible enough,

1430
01:39:26,993 --> 01:39:29,963
letting those street thugs
handle something so delicate.

1431
01:39:31,396 --> 01:39:33,699
What I'm suggesting is

1432
01:39:34,434 --> 01:39:38,638
you sell it to me for, say,

1433
01:39:40,006 --> 01:39:41,508
half a million dollars.

1434
01:39:43,208 --> 01:39:46,011
Otherwise, I'm sure the police
would be quite interested...

1435
01:39:46,145 --> 01:39:48,347
What the fuck
does this have to do with me?

1436
01:39:52,151 --> 01:39:53,485
All right.

1437
01:39:54,119 --> 01:39:56,189
The FBI received a tip

1438
01:39:56,922 --> 01:39:58,624
that a criminal gang
in Miami

1439
01:39:58,757 --> 01:40:02,595
was using the painting
as collateral in a drug deal.

1440
01:40:02,729 --> 01:40:05,932
But that proves that it didn't
burn in the explosion,

1441
01:40:06,065 --> 01:40:07,367
wouldn't you say?

1442
01:40:11,070 --> 01:40:12,606
[laughing]

1443
01:40:17,709 --> 01:40:21,580
I would advise you to think
about my offer.

1444
01:40:21,714 --> 01:40:24,083
I am quite prepared
to go to the FBI.

1445
01:40:24,217 --> 01:40:25,585
Be my guest.

1446
01:40:25,718 --> 01:40:27,118
Whenever you'd like
to talk about

1447
01:40:27,253 --> 01:40:29,723
the other matter, call me.

1448
01:40:39,364 --> 01:40:40,900
[doorbell rings]

1449
01:40:43,302 --> 01:40:44,770
[Em] <i>Kitsey's not here, Theo.</i>

1450
01:40:44,904 --> 01:40:46,539
[adult Theo] <i>I thought she'd be
back from work by now.</i>

1451
01:40:46,672 --> 01:40:48,140
She's not answering her phone.

1452
01:40:48,275 --> 01:40:50,077
[Em] <i>I don't know
when she'll be back.</i>

1453
01:40:51,410 --> 01:40:52,745
[adult Theo] <i>Okay.</i>

1454
01:40:53,946 --> 01:40:55,915
Can I wait for her here,
please?

1455
01:40:56,882 --> 01:40:59,086
I think you better
come back later.

1456
01:40:59,218 --> 01:41:00,552
[adult Theo] <i>Are you serious?</i>

1457
01:41:00,686 --> 01:41:01,988
<i>I just want to wait
in her room, Em.</i>

1458
01:41:02,120 --> 01:41:03,154
I don't...

1459
01:41:03,288 --> 01:41:04,890
[Em] <i>I live here, too.</i>

1460
01:41:05,025 --> 01:41:07,627
<i>You can't just come
barging in here.</i>

1461
01:41:09,829 --> 01:41:11,765
<i>I'm sorry. It's a bad time.</i>

1462
01:41:13,098 --> 01:41:14,467
[door closes]

1463
01:41:40,726 --> 01:41:42,428
[man] It's all right.

1464
01:41:42,561 --> 01:41:43,896
It's gonna be fine.

1465
01:41:50,736 --> 01:41:51,937
You all right?

1466
01:41:58,211 --> 01:41:59,445
[adult Kitsey] <i>Theo.</i>

1467
01:42:01,748 --> 01:42:03,049
It's so late.

1468
01:42:04,950 --> 01:42:06,653
<i>You should've called me.</i>

1469
01:42:07,119 --> 01:42:08,187
<i>Are you hungry?</i>

1470
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:09,288
<i>I can make us
something to eat,</i>

1471
01:42:09,422 --> 01:42:11,057
if you like?

1472
01:42:11,190 --> 01:42:12,792
Oh, maybe a glass of wine?

1473
01:42:16,995 --> 01:42:18,832
Em said
you stopped by earlier.

1474
01:42:21,467 --> 01:42:22,934
Oh, darling,
will you open this?

1475
01:42:23,069 --> 01:42:24,171
Please don't.

1476
01:42:25,070 --> 01:42:26,071
I'm sorry?

1477
01:42:27,606 --> 01:42:28,941
I saw you.

1478
01:42:37,350 --> 01:42:38,551
Oh.

1479
01:42:38,684 --> 01:42:40,686
You don't mean Tom Cable,
do you?

1480
01:42:42,855 --> 01:42:43,922
He's an old friend.

1481
01:42:44,056 --> 01:42:46,525
Please, Kitsey.
No more secrets.

1482
01:42:52,198 --> 01:42:53,333
[adult Kitsey] <i>I didn't think
it would matter</i>

1483
01:42:53,466 --> 01:42:54,901
<i>until the wedding.</i>

1484
01:42:57,102 --> 01:43:01,239
I tried to break things off
a while back, but...

1485
01:43:01,373 --> 01:43:02,843
But you love him.

1486
01:43:07,079 --> 01:43:09,681
I don't expect you to know
what it feels like

1487
01:43:09,815 --> 01:43:12,018
to be in love
with the wrong person.

1488
01:43:15,922 --> 01:43:16,989
[scoffs]

1489
01:43:17,323 --> 01:43:19,025
Theo...

1490
01:43:19,158 --> 01:43:21,695
does it really matter
as much as all that?

1491
01:43:25,931 --> 01:43:27,733
You know it doesn't.

1492
01:43:28,734 --> 01:43:30,035
Not really.

1493
01:43:31,904 --> 01:43:33,740
I know about your things.

1494
01:43:35,307 --> 01:43:37,243
My things?

1495
01:43:37,376 --> 01:43:39,646
Take all the drugs you want,
I don't care.

1496
01:43:41,913 --> 01:43:43,815
This marriage makes sense.

1497
01:43:44,417 --> 01:43:49,222
Mommy loves you so much.

1498
01:43:51,856 --> 01:43:53,526
It's a good match.

1499
01:43:54,628 --> 01:43:57,163
We like each other
and we get on.

1500
01:44:02,267 --> 01:44:03,636
Head not heart?

1501
01:44:05,236 --> 01:44:06,539
If you like.

1502
01:44:15,914 --> 01:44:17,149
[woman] <i>$2,000.</i>

1503
01:44:17,984 --> 01:44:19,952
Reilly and Britton, of course.

1504
01:44:20,086 --> 01:44:22,622
First edition, first printing.

1505
01:44:24,024 --> 01:44:25,725
As you can see,
in beautiful condition.

1506
01:44:28,227 --> 01:44:29,229
I'll take it.

1507
01:44:30,428 --> 01:44:31,431
[woman] For yourself?

1508
01:44:31,564 --> 01:44:33,033
No. A gift.

1509
01:44:33,766 --> 01:44:35,101
Lucky person.

1510
01:44:39,504 --> 01:44:41,106
[Hobie chuckles]
Look at this.

1511
01:44:42,208 --> 01:44:46,078
Stored in some unheated shed
in Watervliet.

1512
01:44:46,212 --> 01:44:48,281
It's amazing
it survived at all,

1513
01:44:48,414 --> 01:44:49,882
but look at the grain though.

1514
01:44:55,186 --> 01:44:56,189
What?

1515
01:44:57,088 --> 01:44:58,656
I didn't want to bother you.

1516
01:44:58,790 --> 01:45:00,092
Bother me with what?

1517
01:45:02,127 --> 01:45:06,332
This guy Reeve,
Lucius Reeve,

1518
01:45:06,466 --> 01:45:09,169
I sold him the chest-on-chest
with the Affleck ornament.

1519
01:45:10,470 --> 01:45:11,671
And?

1520
01:45:12,271 --> 01:45:14,607
I sold it as an Affleck.

1521
01:45:16,141 --> 01:45:19,811
I should have never, never.
But I didn't know what to do.

1522
01:45:19,945 --> 01:45:21,446
We had the IRS calling
every other day,

1523
01:45:21,580 --> 01:45:22,681
and now he's got it in for us.

1524
01:45:22,815 --> 01:45:24,015
Well, give him the money back.

1525
01:45:24,150 --> 01:45:26,953
I've tried. I don't know
what he wants.

1526
01:45:27,552 --> 01:45:28,787
Uh...

1527
01:45:28,922 --> 01:45:30,522
Dealers live
by their reputation, Theo.

1528
01:45:30,655 --> 01:45:31,824
It's an honor system.

1529
01:45:33,458 --> 01:45:34,827
If, uh...

1530
01:45:36,395 --> 01:45:38,631
If word got out that...

1531
01:45:39,464 --> 01:45:41,100
I'll put it right, Hobie.

1532
01:45:42,301 --> 01:45:44,003
I'll offer him more than
what he paid for the piece.

1533
01:45:44,137 --> 01:45:45,939
I'm sure he just wants money.

1534
01:45:48,673 --> 01:45:50,042
[Hobie] Hmm.

1535
01:45:54,446 --> 01:45:55,681
Hobie?

1536
01:46:00,252 --> 01:46:01,955
- [door opens]
- [bell tinkling]

1537
01:46:02,788 --> 01:46:04,289
[footsteps approaching]

1538
01:46:05,757 --> 01:46:07,026
[door closes]

1539
01:46:16,468 --> 01:46:17,671
Pippa?

1540
01:46:18,471 --> 01:46:19,806
Hello, lovely.

1541
01:46:25,611 --> 01:46:27,379
Are you gonna change the sign?

1542
01:46:27,913 --> 01:46:28,914
[adult Theo] No.

1543
01:46:29,047 --> 01:46:30,782
I didn't ask him to.

1544
01:46:30,915 --> 01:46:32,418
I know you didn't.

1545
01:46:34,087 --> 01:46:36,756
But Hobie's always saying
you've turned things around.

1546
01:46:37,757 --> 01:46:39,091
Quite the salesman.

1547
01:46:40,226 --> 01:46:42,429
And who'd have thought it?
Antique furniture?

1548
01:46:51,604 --> 01:46:52,972
[adult Theo] Do you miss it?

1549
01:46:53,705 --> 01:46:55,074
New York?

1550
01:46:57,109 --> 01:46:59,178
Don't let me forget,
I've got a book for you.

1551
01:47:00,613 --> 01:47:02,147
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

1552
01:47:04,249 --> 01:47:06,151
I've got something
for you, too.

1553
01:47:08,954 --> 01:47:10,088
[adult Pippa] It's good timing.

1554
01:47:10,222 --> 01:47:12,290
I finished my book
on the plane.

1555
01:47:12,423 --> 01:47:14,894
I've got you
<i>The Rings of Saturn.</i>

1556
01:47:15,026 --> 01:47:17,129
Everett said he thought
you'd like it.

1557
01:47:26,573 --> 01:47:28,173
- Is it good?
- Mmm-hmm.

1558
01:47:28,306 --> 01:47:29,341
Great.

1559
01:47:29,476 --> 01:47:31,777
I'm really glad
you're happy, Theo.

1560
01:47:31,910 --> 01:47:33,512
I can't believe
I haven't even met her

1561
01:47:33,645 --> 01:47:34,913
and you're getting married.

1562
01:47:35,413 --> 01:47:36,581
Yeah.

1563
01:47:36,716 --> 01:47:37,984
It was all pretty fast.

1564
01:47:40,285 --> 01:47:42,288
Well, I guess when you know,
you know.

1565
01:47:51,129 --> 01:47:53,432
Okay. I'm bushed.

1566
01:47:54,734 --> 01:47:56,002
Time for bed.

1567
01:48:03,742 --> 01:48:04,909
Night.

1568
01:48:05,043 --> 01:48:06,278
[door opens, closes]

1569
01:48:32,171 --> 01:48:33,740
[narrator on screen]
<i>I remember the feeling of,</i>

1570
01:48:33,873 --> 01:48:35,441
<i>"Who is this guy?"</i>

1571
01:48:35,574 --> 01:48:38,944
<i>That each voice is so clearly
etched in the eloquence</i>

1572
01:48:39,078 --> 01:48:40,279
<i>with which
he was able to play</i>

1573
01:48:40,412 --> 01:48:41,614
<i>the left
and the right hands,</i>

1574
01:48:41,747 --> 01:48:43,082
<i>so they sounded almost like</i>

1575
01:48:43,216 --> 01:48:45,385
<i>it was a duet
played with yourself.</i>

1576
01:48:51,524 --> 01:48:53,059
[adult Theo] <i>I'm sorry.</i>

1577
01:48:54,659 --> 01:48:56,128
<i>I thought you'd like it.</i>

1578
01:48:57,296 --> 01:48:58,597
[adult Pippa] <i>I loved it.</i>

1579
01:49:00,065 --> 01:49:03,068
<i>It just reminded me
of that world.</i>

1580
01:49:06,071 --> 01:49:07,574
It was really hard, you know.

1581
01:49:08,941 --> 01:49:12,945
You just practice, practice,
practice, six hours a day.

1582
01:49:14,247 --> 01:49:17,417
And then everything
stopped that day.

1583
01:49:18,717 --> 01:49:21,253
Now I can't even
go to a concert. [sniffles]

1584
01:49:22,721 --> 01:49:23,923
And Welty...

1585
01:49:25,190 --> 01:49:26,591
you know, he was
only with me that day

1586
01:49:26,726 --> 01:49:29,863
because I was making him
take me to an audition.

1587
01:49:30,829 --> 01:49:32,765
It was my fault, Thee.

1588
01:49:32,897 --> 01:49:34,132
Come home.

1589
01:49:36,836 --> 01:49:38,104
Home here?

1590
01:49:38,738 --> 01:49:40,039
Yes.

1591
01:49:41,207 --> 01:49:42,642
What about Everett?

1592
01:49:45,177 --> 01:49:47,013
When I was with Welty,

1593
01:49:48,413 --> 01:49:50,115
when he gave me this ring,

1594
01:49:51,249 --> 01:49:53,285
something happened between us.

1595
01:49:56,189 --> 01:49:58,091
Like the way he guided me
to the shop.

1596
01:50:00,092 --> 01:50:02,295
The minute I was there,
it felt right.

1597
01:50:03,863 --> 01:50:05,765
And antiques?

1598
01:50:05,897 --> 01:50:08,434
Why would I be interested?
Who would've known that?

1599
01:50:08,566 --> 01:50:09,801
But I was.

1600
01:50:09,936 --> 01:50:13,272
It's like he sent me
exactly where I needed to be.

1601
01:50:14,038 --> 01:50:16,441
And to who
I needed to be with.

1602
01:50:21,113 --> 01:50:22,481
Pippa.

1603
01:50:26,851 --> 01:50:28,120
- I...
- I know.

1604
01:50:28,954 --> 01:50:30,556
I know.

1605
01:50:33,059 --> 01:50:34,427
Don't think I don't.

1606
01:50:41,499 --> 01:50:42,534
Yes.

1607
01:50:43,769 --> 01:50:45,003
I miss it.

1608
01:50:47,138 --> 01:50:48,306
New York.

1609
01:50:49,307 --> 01:50:51,276
But I'll tell you
why I don't come back.

1610
01:50:52,845 --> 01:50:54,446
Because at least in London,

1611
01:50:56,347 --> 01:50:59,318
I don't think about it...

1612
01:51:00,386 --> 01:51:02,187
every second of the day.

1613
01:51:06,391 --> 01:51:08,528
But I miss it. [sniffles]

1614
01:51:10,195 --> 01:51:11,530
I miss Hobie.

1615
01:51:14,132 --> 01:51:15,401
And I miss you.

1616
01:51:29,047 --> 01:51:30,181
[sniffles]

1617
01:51:30,315 --> 01:51:33,019
We are an awful lot alike,
Theo.

1618
01:51:36,521 --> 01:51:38,457
What we both went through,

1619
01:51:38,589 --> 01:51:41,159
I don't think we can lean
on each other.

1620
01:51:43,395 --> 01:51:45,298
If one of us went down...

1621
01:51:47,566 --> 01:51:49,234
the other would go with them.

1622
01:51:53,939 --> 01:51:55,441
Theo, I'm sorry.

1623
01:51:59,043 --> 01:52:00,680
No. No.

1624
01:52:00,812 --> 01:52:02,047
I'm sorry. [sniffles]

1625
01:52:09,954 --> 01:52:11,189
It's okay.

1626
01:52:18,297 --> 01:52:19,832
[line ringing]

1627
01:52:20,466 --> 01:52:21,867
[Jerome on phone] <i>Yo.</i>

1628
01:52:21,999 --> 01:52:24,903
[adult Theo] Jerome?
I need some. Where do I go?

1629
01:52:25,037 --> 01:52:28,908
<i>Hit up my girl Katrina.
Bar G-Slack off Avenue B.</i>

1630
01:52:29,574 --> 01:52:31,776
[music playing on speakers]

1631
01:52:32,378 --> 01:52:34,113
[indistinct chatter]

1632
01:52:43,221 --> 01:52:45,323
Does Katrina work here?

1633
01:52:46,191 --> 01:52:47,526
Katrina?

1634
01:52:48,828 --> 01:52:50,729
I'm a friend of Jerome's.

1635
01:52:50,861 --> 01:52:54,399
He said, uh, she might be
able to help me.

1636
01:52:55,900 --> 01:52:57,135
What's her second name?

1637
01:53:01,774 --> 01:53:03,276
Help you with what?

1638
01:53:05,944 --> 01:53:07,346
It doesn't matter.

1639
01:53:15,654 --> 01:53:16,656
Hey.

1640
01:53:19,525 --> 01:53:20,593
Potter!

1641
01:53:27,098 --> 01:53:28,301
Boris?

1642
01:53:33,939 --> 01:53:36,909
[speaking Russian]

1643
01:53:37,042 --> 01:53:38,311
[speaks Russian]

1644
01:53:42,280 --> 01:53:43,614
[in English]
How did you know I'd be here?

1645
01:53:43,748 --> 01:53:44,749
I... I didn't.

1646
01:53:44,883 --> 01:53:47,352
- You weren't looking for me?
- What?

1647
01:53:47,485 --> 01:53:49,721
This is just accident?

1648
01:53:51,123 --> 01:53:52,325
Yes.

1649
01:53:54,726 --> 01:53:55,727
All right.

1650
01:53:56,428 --> 01:53:57,896
[both chuckle]

1651
01:53:58,029 --> 01:53:59,798
To accident then. Hmm?

1652
01:54:14,279 --> 01:54:15,580
They serve food here?

1653
01:54:16,347 --> 01:54:17,850
Not usually.

1654
01:54:20,185 --> 01:54:21,521
What do you do?

1655
01:54:22,053 --> 01:54:23,320
This, that.

1656
01:54:23,454 --> 01:54:27,292
Many things, you know.
Just getting by.

1657
01:54:29,360 --> 01:54:30,561
You living in New York?

1658
01:54:30,695 --> 01:54:33,297
No. I travel a lot.
Sometimes here.

1659
01:54:33,431 --> 01:54:36,133
Uh, Sweden, Belgium, Germany.

1660
01:54:36,267 --> 01:54:37,535
- Russia?
- Not so much.

1661
01:54:38,404 --> 01:54:41,774
I thought maybe you went back
to Russia

1662
01:54:42,440 --> 01:54:44,141
because you never came.

1663
01:54:44,275 --> 01:54:47,311
Well, um, very fucked-up time.

1664
01:54:47,445 --> 01:54:49,281
For a while,
I worked for Mr. Silver.

1665
01:54:49,714 --> 01:54:50,649
What?

1666
01:54:50,783 --> 01:54:52,551
I was living with Xandra
at the time.

1667
01:54:52,684 --> 01:54:53,718
What?

1668
01:54:53,852 --> 01:54:55,587
My dad had moved.
I had nowhere to go.

1669
01:54:55,721 --> 01:54:57,289
We ended up getting along.

1670
01:54:57,422 --> 01:54:58,690
Mr. Silver would come round.

1671
01:54:58,824 --> 01:55:00,926
So for a while,
I am his assistant.

1672
01:55:01,059 --> 01:55:02,061
Do this, do that.

1673
01:55:02,194 --> 01:55:03,562
I can't believe you're here.

1674
01:55:04,529 --> 01:55:06,497
Do you know
what I did in college?

1675
01:55:06,632 --> 01:55:09,835
Conversational Russian,
because of you.

1676
01:55:13,506 --> 01:55:15,508
It used to make me
think of you.

1677
01:55:19,177 --> 01:55:20,379
[chuckles softly]

1678
01:55:22,247 --> 01:55:23,481
Potter...

1679
01:55:23,614 --> 01:55:25,885
I am so sorry
for what I did to you.

1680
01:55:28,854 --> 01:55:30,222
Forget it.

1681
01:55:30,888 --> 01:55:31,990
No, I can't.

1682
01:55:37,262 --> 01:55:38,597
Are you happy?

1683
01:55:40,833 --> 01:55:41,734
Not very.

1684
01:55:42,868 --> 01:55:43,769
A girl?

1685
01:55:45,236 --> 01:55:47,272
Look, it's not that. It's...

1686
01:55:49,240 --> 01:55:50,943
I'm engaged to be married.

1687
01:55:53,979 --> 01:55:55,414
I don't know why
I'm telling you this,

1688
01:55:56,781 --> 01:55:59,651
but I saw her kissing
another guy.

1689
01:56:01,654 --> 01:56:03,555
Old friend of mine. Tom Cable.

1690
01:56:03,689 --> 01:56:04,923
The asshole
with the cigarette,

1691
01:56:05,056 --> 01:56:06,258
when you were a kid?

1692
01:56:09,194 --> 01:56:10,562
And you love her.

1693
01:56:12,263 --> 01:56:13,665
But not too much, I think.

1694
01:56:15,132 --> 01:56:16,534
It's complicated.

1695
01:56:20,038 --> 01:56:21,507
There is someone else?

1696
01:56:24,743 --> 01:56:26,445
All right. Enough of this.

1697
01:56:26,579 --> 01:56:28,514
Let's go somewhere.
Let's get a taxi.

1698
01:56:28,646 --> 01:56:29,847
- A taxi?
- [chuckles]

1699
01:56:29,981 --> 01:56:30,915
[laughs]

1700
01:56:31,048 --> 01:56:32,917
[laughing]

1701
01:56:33,052 --> 01:56:35,287
You've got a fucking driver.
You?

1702
01:56:35,419 --> 01:56:37,556
[laughing]
I have a fucking driver!

1703
01:56:37,689 --> 01:56:40,159
Gyuri, say hello to Potter.

1704
01:56:40,292 --> 01:56:41,593
[Gyuri] Hello, Potter.

1705
01:56:42,026 --> 01:56:43,494
Hello, Gyuri.

1706
01:56:43,628 --> 01:56:45,163
[stammers] Watch the, uh...

1707
01:56:45,297 --> 01:56:46,897
Watch, you're spilling it!

1708
01:56:47,031 --> 01:56:48,199
Hold it still!

1709
01:56:48,333 --> 01:56:49,435
[inhaling]

1710
01:56:49,568 --> 01:56:51,470
[laughing]

1711
01:56:53,038 --> 01:56:54,607
Come work for me.

1712
01:56:54,739 --> 01:56:58,108
Fate brings us together again.
And you are not happy.

1713
01:56:58,243 --> 01:56:59,544
I want to repay you

1714
01:56:59,677 --> 01:57:01,212
because everything good
that has happened

1715
01:57:01,346 --> 01:57:03,149
is because of you.

1716
01:57:03,281 --> 01:57:05,784
That's great. I got you
started as a drug dealer.

1717
01:57:05,918 --> 01:57:09,054
Not drug dealing.
I have a good life.

1718
01:57:09,186 --> 01:57:10,622
We could...

1719
01:57:11,022 --> 01:57:12,091
[sighs]

1720
01:57:14,126 --> 01:57:16,896
I am so sorry, Potter.

1721
01:57:18,129 --> 01:57:20,199
So sorry for what I did.

1722
01:57:20,333 --> 01:57:22,534
- Forget it.
- I can't forget it.

1723
01:57:23,435 --> 01:57:25,338
That I should
treat you so badly.

1724
01:57:26,471 --> 01:57:28,272
And I have tried,
I swear to you,

1725
01:57:28,405 --> 01:57:29,841
I have tried to get it back.

1726
01:57:31,010 --> 01:57:32,476
I thought you might have
heard about Miami

1727
01:57:32,610 --> 01:57:34,946
and I wanted to tell you
that nothing,

1728
01:57:35,079 --> 01:57:37,682
nothing could be
traced back to you.

1729
01:57:43,321 --> 01:57:44,522
No.

1730
01:57:46,525 --> 01:57:47,993
You never opened it?

1731
01:57:48,126 --> 01:57:49,427
All these years?

1732
01:57:50,462 --> 01:57:52,297
How could you
not fucking open it?

1733
01:57:52,431 --> 01:57:53,665
Shut the fuck up.
What are you...

1734
01:57:53,798 --> 01:57:56,667
You had stayed,
I would have...

1735
01:57:56,801 --> 01:58:00,372
I would have given it
back to you. I promise.

1736
01:58:00,506 --> 01:58:02,374
Told you
that I had switched it.

1737
01:58:02,507 --> 01:58:03,842
But you wouldn't wait.

1738
01:58:03,976 --> 01:58:05,777
You had to go straight away
and I was scared

1739
01:58:05,910 --> 01:58:07,511
to tell you
that I'm so ashamed.

1740
01:58:07,645 --> 01:58:09,080
Still so ashamed!

1741
01:58:09,213 --> 01:58:11,382
Bullshit! Nobody knew
about it. No one has ever...

1742
01:58:11,516 --> 01:58:13,819
You are a blackout drunk,
Potter.

1743
01:58:15,453 --> 01:58:17,656
You showed me it.

1744
01:58:17,788 --> 01:58:20,759
At Thanksgiving.
Totally wrecked.

1745
01:58:22,494 --> 01:58:25,030
You unwrapped it
and showed me.

1746
01:58:26,597 --> 01:58:28,934
And I wanted it.
But not to sell.

1747
01:58:29,066 --> 01:58:32,136
I swear to you. You cannot
sell something like that.

1748
01:58:32,270 --> 01:58:33,806
I don't believe...

1749
01:58:34,873 --> 01:58:36,374
I don't believe
one word you're saying.

1750
01:58:36,507 --> 01:58:38,676
This is the back
of the painting.

1751
01:58:39,677 --> 01:58:42,414
The verso proved
that we have it.

1752
01:58:43,948 --> 01:58:47,453
The painting was used as
collateral on certain deals.

1753
01:58:49,954 --> 01:58:51,422
Until Miami.

1754
01:58:52,290 --> 01:58:54,825
And I swear to you, Potter,
I swear...

1755
01:58:54,959 --> 01:58:56,427
What are you... Wait, Potter!

1756
01:58:56,561 --> 01:58:57,930
- [tires screech]
- Please, stop!

1757
01:59:00,364 --> 01:59:01,900
[panting]

1758
01:59:45,043 --> 01:59:46,044
Move! Get out!

1759
01:59:55,654 --> 01:59:57,089
[muffled explosion]

1760
02:00:25,482 --> 02:00:26,851
[door opens]

1761
02:00:28,820 --> 02:00:30,189
[door closes]

1762
02:00:37,495 --> 02:00:39,163
[Hobie] He came
to see me today.

1763
02:00:41,333 --> 02:00:42,668
Reeve.

1764
02:00:44,869 --> 02:00:47,705
He had photocopies,
bills of shipping.

1765
02:00:49,975 --> 02:00:50,708
Dozens.

1766
02:00:50,842 --> 02:00:52,344
All right. Listen...

1767
02:00:52,476 --> 02:00:53,979
I wanted to tell you.

1768
02:00:54,980 --> 02:00:57,750
I was just trying
to settle some debts.

1769
02:00:57,882 --> 02:00:59,150
I didn't know
how to get out from under.

1770
02:00:59,284 --> 02:01:01,720
No, no, you don't
have to tell me.

1771
02:01:01,852 --> 02:01:05,223
Business turning around
and it suited me

1772
02:01:06,757 --> 02:01:07,859
to keep my head in the sand.

1773
02:01:07,993 --> 02:01:09,394
No, no, that's not
what I'm saying.

1774
02:01:09,526 --> 02:01:10,863
This is all my fault.

1775
02:01:11,495 --> 02:01:13,565
And I'll fix it.

1776
02:01:14,732 --> 02:01:16,569
That's not why he came.

1777
02:01:23,507 --> 02:01:24,943
Is it true?

1778
02:01:28,846 --> 02:01:32,150
Please tell me it isn't true.

1779
02:01:36,020 --> 02:01:37,054
Hobie...

1780
02:01:37,189 --> 02:01:39,091
I called him a liar
and threw him out.

1781
02:01:40,191 --> 02:01:41,260
Now, tell me.

1782
02:01:43,293 --> 02:01:44,363
Is it true?

1783
02:01:46,297 --> 02:01:47,932
The painting?

1784
02:01:50,702 --> 02:01:51,971
Yes.

1785
02:01:54,707 --> 02:01:56,909
Do you know the history
of that painting?

1786
02:01:58,342 --> 02:02:01,913
Do you know that it was his
last painting because he died?

1787
02:02:02,047 --> 02:02:05,851
Died in an explosion.
A stupid accident.

1788
02:02:07,985 --> 02:02:11,689
And one of the only things
that survived,

1789
02:02:11,823 --> 02:02:13,825
like a miracle,

1790
02:02:14,693 --> 02:02:16,028
was that little bird.

1791
02:02:19,897 --> 02:02:24,102
Like nothing that had been
painted before.

1792
02:02:26,337 --> 02:02:29,106
And somehow,
miracle after miracle,

1793
02:02:29,240 --> 02:02:32,176
it survives through centuries.

1794
02:02:35,180 --> 02:02:36,649
Until you.

1795
02:02:39,583 --> 02:02:41,153
Hobie, I never meant...

1796
02:02:43,288 --> 02:02:45,490
I didn't know
what it was at first.

1797
02:02:46,458 --> 02:02:49,428
And then, I don't even know
why I kept it.

1798
02:02:49,561 --> 02:02:52,764
[stammering] I was just
trying to keep it safe.

1799
02:02:52,897 --> 02:02:55,668
It wasn't yours to keep!

1800
02:03:00,504 --> 02:03:05,176
My whole life,
everything I've tried to do...

1801
02:03:07,245 --> 02:03:08,312
I don't know.

1802
02:03:09,181 --> 02:03:10,781
I don't know,
maybe it's ignoble

1803
02:03:10,914 --> 02:03:13,952
to care too much
about objects.

1804
02:03:14,985 --> 02:03:16,387
But, Theo...

1805
02:03:18,789 --> 02:03:22,461
that painting,
pulled from the fire...

1806
02:03:24,395 --> 02:03:28,332
passed down,
saved, preserved...

1807
02:03:28,467 --> 02:03:30,402
so it could be handed on.

1808
02:03:31,470 --> 02:03:32,905
And handed...

1809
02:03:36,540 --> 02:03:37,810
We die.

1810
02:03:39,377 --> 02:03:40,713
We all die.

1811
02:03:42,913 --> 02:03:47,752
But to destroy,
to lose something

1812
02:03:51,222 --> 02:03:53,124
that should have been
immortal...

1813
02:04:16,647 --> 02:04:18,016
Is it lost?

1814
02:04:22,954 --> 02:04:24,256
[exhales deeply]

1815
02:04:24,388 --> 02:04:25,757
[sniffles]

1816
02:04:28,426 --> 02:04:29,428
Hobie...

1817
02:04:31,229 --> 02:04:33,132
I never meant you any harm.

1818
02:04:34,632 --> 02:04:35,834
Never.

1819
02:04:46,311 --> 02:04:47,479
[door opens]

1820
02:04:49,448 --> 02:04:50,449

- [soft music playing]

1822
02:04:58,556 --> 02:05:00,191
Cheers. Happy for you two.

1823
02:05:00,324 --> 02:05:01,525
[adult Kitsey]
Oh, thank you for coming.

1824
02:05:01,659 --> 02:05:02,827
Come over and say hi to Anne.

1825
02:05:02,961 --> 02:05:04,329
I think she's over there
by the corner.

1826
02:05:15,940 --> 02:05:17,309
Everything okay?

1827
02:05:21,346 --> 02:05:22,847
The best thing
that ever happened to her

1828
02:05:22,980 --> 02:05:25,184
is when you came along.

1829
02:05:26,751 --> 02:05:28,186
Did your mother know, Platt?

1830
02:05:30,355 --> 02:05:33,492
She said from the beginning,
it was just an infatuation.

1831
02:05:35,459 --> 02:05:37,995
Women always love assholes,
am I right?

1832
02:05:44,168 --> 02:05:45,537
We need more drinks.

1833
02:05:55,946 --> 02:05:57,216
Oh, hi.

1834
02:06:04,689 --> 02:06:05,958
Which one is she?

1835
02:06:06,958 --> 02:06:08,393
Is that her?

1836
02:06:09,327 --> 02:06:12,163
Loveliest lady in the room.

1837
02:06:12,297 --> 02:06:14,699
Go tell your lovely lady
that you have to leave.

1838
02:06:14,833 --> 02:06:16,501
What are you doing here?

1839
02:06:16,633 --> 02:06:18,735
I have a ticket for you,
but we must go now.

1840
02:06:18,869 --> 02:06:20,337
- Where?
- Amsterdam.

1841
02:06:20,471 --> 02:06:22,706
Why the fuck
would I go to Amsterdam?

1842
02:06:22,841 --> 02:06:24,409
'Cause you want it back.

1843
02:06:28,812 --> 02:06:30,348
[indistinct chatter]

1844
02:06:44,596 --> 02:06:46,564
- I'll find you later, okay?
- Yes.

1845
02:06:46,696 --> 02:06:48,432
[gasps] Oh!

1846
02:06:48,566 --> 02:06:49,633
There you are.

1847
02:06:50,369 --> 02:06:51,970
Oh, you must meet
my godmother,

1848
02:06:52,102 --> 02:06:53,805
Anne de Larmessin.

1849
02:06:53,939 --> 02:06:55,307
What are you doing?

1850
02:06:56,841 --> 02:06:57,943
Hmm?

1851
02:06:59,811 --> 02:07:01,213
I'm going.

1852
02:07:01,346 --> 02:07:03,882
You can't.
There's more photographs.

1853
02:07:04,016 --> 02:07:06,951
I'm going to be away
for a few days.

1854
02:07:07,084 --> 02:07:08,921
Make up an excuse for me.

1855
02:07:10,321 --> 02:07:12,056
Are you coming back?

1856
02:07:15,059 --> 02:07:16,528
Take care, Kitsey.

1857
02:07:29,574 --> 02:07:31,476
[adult Theo] <i>Before and after.</i>

1858
02:07:32,409 --> 02:07:35,146
<i>Everything is
before and after.</i>

1859
02:07:37,015 --> 02:07:39,383
<i>In the middle is the painting.</i>

1860
02:07:40,284 --> 02:07:42,254
<i>The one thing you did.</i>

1861
02:07:43,854 --> 02:07:47,258
<i>You crossed the border
into another country.</i>

1862
02:07:48,793 --> 02:07:50,429
<i>And now you can never go back.</i>

1863
02:07:52,797 --> 02:07:55,066
You cannot sell a painting
like that, Potter.

1864
02:07:55,199 --> 02:07:56,666
It's quickest way
to get caught.

1865
02:07:57,568 --> 02:07:59,370
<i>People with goods,
they front you,</i>

1866
02:07:59,503 --> 02:08:01,238
<i>hold painting as collateral.</i>

1867
02:08:01,372 --> 02:08:03,074
<i>You sell the goods,
you give them their cut,</i>

1868
02:08:03,208 --> 02:08:04,275
<i>painting is returned.</i>

1869
02:08:04,409 --> 02:08:05,644
[adult Theo] <i>Who?</i>

1870
02:08:05,776 --> 02:08:06,778
Who took the painting?

1871
02:08:07,311 --> 02:08:09,013
A German guy I know.

1872
02:08:09,146 --> 02:08:11,682
Deals in stolen art.
Calls himself Sascha.

1873
02:08:11,815 --> 02:08:13,883
Was involved in setting up
the operation

1874
02:08:14,017 --> 02:08:15,220
with those Miami assholes.

1875
02:08:16,053 --> 02:08:18,722
And then, he went missing.

1876
02:08:19,790 --> 02:08:23,093
<i>Now Sascha is feeling heat
from FBI raid.</i>

1877
02:08:23,227 --> 02:08:26,664
<i>So he is willing
to offload it for cash.</i>

1878
02:08:35,406 --> 02:08:37,141
Glad to see you again, Potter.

1879
02:08:37,275 --> 02:08:38,476
You know, that's not
actually my name.

1880
02:08:38,610 --> 02:08:39,544
So?

1881
02:08:39,677 --> 02:08:42,247
Sascha is here
with the painting.

1882
02:08:42,379 --> 02:08:45,283
Victor got in touch,
said he had a buyer.

1883
02:08:45,417 --> 02:08:46,985
An American businessman.

1884
02:08:47,119 --> 02:08:49,687
And who's this
American businessman?

1885
02:08:49,820 --> 02:08:50,789
That would be you.

1886
02:08:55,827 --> 02:08:57,095
You want the painting back?

1887
02:08:57,928 --> 02:08:59,062
<i>Yes?</i>

1888
02:08:59,196 --> 02:09:00,297
[adult Theo] <i>Yes.</i>

1889
02:09:00,431 --> 02:09:02,300
I am going to do this.

1890
02:09:03,635 --> 02:09:05,704
I'm going to make
everything right again.

1892
02:09:10,909 --> 02:09:11,910

1893
02:09:12,043 --> 02:09:13,979
40,000. My money.

1894
02:09:14,111 --> 02:09:15,814
This they get to keep.

1895
02:09:15,946 --> 02:09:18,716
That way, they don't look
so close at bank draft.

1896
02:09:18,850 --> 02:09:22,486
By the time they realize is
no good, we are long gone.

1897
02:09:22,620 --> 02:09:23,687
Now story is,

1898
02:09:23,820 --> 02:09:26,425
you are based in New York,

1899
02:09:30,860 --> 02:09:32,096

Right, I'll see you later.

02:11:34,284 --> 02:11:35,686
A lot of trouble,

1910
02:11:37,821 --> 02:11:39,457

1911
02:11:40,925 --> 02:11:42,193
Yes.

1954
02:16:19,736 --> 02:16:21,605
Okay. [grunts]

1955
02:16:21,739 --> 02:16:23,708
Let's go. [panting]

1956
02:16:24,374 --> 02:16:26,109
There he is. That's it.

1957
02:16:31,214 --> 02:16:32,181
Come on.

1958
02:16:32,315 --> 02:16:34,318
<i>The Chinese boy,</i>

1959
02:16:34,450 --> 02:16:36,653
<i>maybe he runs back to Sascha.</i>

1960
02:16:36,786 --> 02:16:38,655
<i>Gyuri knew this place
in Frankfurt</i>

1961
02:16:38,788 --> 02:16:40,757
<i>that Sascha used to use.</i>

1962
02:16:40,892 --> 02:16:43,494
Place is like fortress.

1963
02:16:43,627 --> 02:16:46,262
Cameras, locks,
pass-codes and shit.

1964
02:16:46,396 --> 02:16:47,598
Need army to get in.

1965
02:16:47,732 --> 02:16:49,566
Or police.

1966
02:16:51,467 --> 02:16:53,504
Eat. You should.

1967
02:16:55,473 --> 02:16:59,343
All right, so, problem is
police need probable cause.

1968
02:16:59,476 --> 02:17:04,883
Gyuri has cousin,
works in very expensive bar.

1969
02:17:05,715 --> 02:17:07,384
Now he goes to the police

1970
02:17:07,518 --> 02:17:09,919
and says he sees
two Germans arguing,

1971
02:17:10,054 --> 02:17:13,156
and one of them
leaves behind folder.

1972
02:17:13,289 --> 02:17:15,526
And inside the folder?

1973
02:17:15,660 --> 02:17:17,461
Photograph of <i>Goldfinch,</i>

1974
02:17:17,595 --> 02:17:18,929
newspaper articles,

1975
02:17:19,063 --> 02:17:22,399
and FedEx envelope
with Sascha's address.

1976
02:17:22,533 --> 02:17:24,635
Next day, is like movie.

1977
02:17:24,768 --> 02:17:27,470
SWAT team fucking
breaking down the door.

1978
02:17:27,605 --> 02:17:29,841
I didn't see it happen.
I wish I had.

1979
02:17:29,974 --> 02:17:31,442
To see the look
on Sascha's face,

1980
02:17:31,574 --> 02:17:32,642
being dragged out.

1981
02:17:32,776 --> 02:17:34,111
[chuckling]

1982
02:17:36,313 --> 02:17:37,581
And yes.

1983
02:17:40,083 --> 02:17:41,151
It is there.

1984
02:17:43,454 --> 02:17:45,223
- Your bird.
- [chuckles]

1985
02:17:46,422 --> 02:17:47,758
They find it

1986
02:17:48,292 --> 02:17:49,794
and it is safe.

1987
02:17:52,395 --> 02:17:53,931
[exhales sharply]

1988
02:17:54,530 --> 02:17:55,866
You are welcome.

1989
02:17:56,633 --> 02:17:58,402
But there is more.

1990
02:17:58,536 --> 02:18:00,671
They find other paintings.

1991
02:18:00,804 --> 02:18:03,341
Stolen paintings.
And also

1992
02:18:03,474 --> 02:18:04,675
a Rembrandt.

1993
02:18:04,807 --> 02:18:06,610
Now drink more coffee.

1994
02:18:12,182 --> 02:18:13,617
Listen to me.

1995
02:18:14,751 --> 02:18:16,186
Is important.

1996
02:18:17,887 --> 02:18:21,625
You talk about bad things
you have done.

1997
02:18:22,426 --> 02:18:23,994
And you blame yourself.

1998
02:18:25,729 --> 02:18:26,998
You wish...

1999
02:18:29,500 --> 02:18:30,834
wish you were dead.

2000
02:18:34,670 --> 02:18:36,840
So we have done bad things.

2001
02:18:38,409 --> 02:18:41,745
But maybe sometimes
good can come from bad.

2002
02:18:44,447 --> 02:18:46,783
[stammers] If you hadn't...

2003
02:18:46,918 --> 02:18:49,053
if I hadn't...

2004
02:18:49,186 --> 02:18:52,190
maybe none of these paintings
would be found.

2005
02:18:52,788 --> 02:18:54,025
Maybe is...

2006
02:18:57,928 --> 02:19:01,665
like huge fucking
weather system rolling over

2007
02:19:01,798 --> 02:19:05,869
and we just get blown
and maybe is fate or...

2008
02:19:09,507 --> 02:19:10,908
Why give name?

2009
02:19:16,046 --> 02:19:17,047
Just...

2010
02:19:18,314 --> 02:19:19,417
life.

2011
02:19:22,118 --> 02:19:23,186
Eh?

2012
02:19:34,931 --> 02:19:38,168
Your bird is
safely back in the world.

2013
02:19:44,775 --> 02:19:46,778
Happy Christmas, Potter.

2014
02:19:54,384 --> 02:19:55,919
[woman] <i>Theo...</i>

2015
02:19:57,355 --> 02:19:59,457
there's too much to see.

2016
02:20:00,590 --> 02:20:01,992
There's <i>The Anatomy Lesson.</i>

2017
02:20:02,125 --> 02:20:04,728
And we should see
Frans Hals, too.

2018
02:20:05,628 --> 02:20:06,897
Oh.

2019
02:20:10,600 --> 02:20:11,802
Look.

2020
02:20:18,307 --> 02:20:19,476
I like this one.

2021
02:20:21,744 --> 02:20:24,147
The Dutch invented
the microscope.

2022
02:20:24,281 --> 02:20:27,918
They wanted it all
as detailed as possible.

2023
02:20:28,052 --> 02:20:30,488
Even the tiniest things
mean something.

2024
02:20:31,688 --> 02:20:33,257
Like that wilted leaf there.

2025
02:20:33,390 --> 02:20:36,126
That's the painter sending you
a secret message

2026
02:20:36,259 --> 02:20:39,429
telling you things don't last.

2027
02:21:08,825 --> 02:21:11,027
[Theo's mother] Oh. Sorry.

2028
02:21:11,161 --> 02:21:13,396
This is the one
I was talking about.

2029
02:21:19,303 --> 02:21:21,439
This is the painting
I love most.

2030
02:21:54,797 --> 02:21:59,797
