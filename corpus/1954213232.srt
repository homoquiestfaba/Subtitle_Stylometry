00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,628
YOU A RELIGIOUS MAN?

175
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,164
GOD-FEARING.
YOU?

176
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,566
( scoffs ) NO.

177
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:30,435
NOT ANYMORE.

178
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,571
<i>I REALLY DON'T</i>
<i>SEE THE POINT.</i>

179
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:36,274
EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF
IN MY OPINION.

180
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:39,878
THAT'S A LONELY WAY
OF THINKING, SON.

181
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:42,513
YOUR CHOICE.

182
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:43,648
I CARE ABOUT THIS TOWN.

183
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:47,185
THE GOOD LORD HAS
BURDENED MY HEART

184
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:48,920
AND I SEE IT AS MY DUTY
TO PROTECT 'EM.

185
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:58,897
Woman:
<i>SUSIE WENT OUT</i>
<i>NIGHT BEFORE LAST</i>

186
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,164
AND SHE HASN'T COME HOME.

187
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:03,968
Sheriff:
<i>WAS SHE ALONE?</i>

188
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,305
THERE WAS A PARTY
OR SOMETHING.  I...

189
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,275
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE THEY WENT.

190
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,646
( whispers )
I TOLD HER WE COULDN'T
AFFORD IT.

191
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:17,582
HEY.

192
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,918
IT'S OKAY, MARGO.

193
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,552
GO AHEAD.

194
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:23,922
SHE WANTS TO GO
TO THE UNIVERSITY.

195
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,924
I TOLD HER
WE COULDN'T AFFORD IT,
SHE STORMED OUT

196
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:27,592
AND THAT'S THE LAST TIME
I SAW HER.

197
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:30,495
I'VE BEEN WORKING
AT WAYNE FLEENER'S,
THE GRAVEYARD SHIFT,

198
00:15:30,497 --> 00:15:32,964
AND I'VE BEEN
SAVING EVERY PENNY
THAT I CAN AND I--

199
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:34,599
IT'S JUST--

200
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,603
DO YOU MIND
IF I KEEP THIS?

201
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,706
CAN YOU TELL ME
IF SHE HAS A BOYFRIEND,

202
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:44,108
- A BEST FRIEND?
- UH, YEAH.

203
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,945
THERE'S THIS KID
NATHAN MILLER.

204
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:48,713
- SHE KNOWS I DON'T APPROVE.
- AND WHY IS THAT?

205
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:50,648
'CAUSE HE'S GOT
ONE THING ON HIS MIND

206
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,685
AND SUSIE'S NOT VERY GOOD
AT TELLING HIM NO.

207
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:57,255
SHE'S DEAD, ISN'T SHE?

208
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:59,157
NO.  NO NO NO NO.

209
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,960
LET'S DON'T JUMP
TO CONCLUSIONS, OKAY?

210
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:03,728
I'M SURE SHE'S FINE.

211
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,505
I USED TO SPEAK
WITH SOMEONE
IN SAN FRANCISCO,

212
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:16,341
BUT I'M FINE.

213
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:20,345
MY HUSBAND, HE INSISTED
I COME SEE YOU.

214
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:28,486
OUR DAUGHTER WAS
KILLED IN AN ACCIDENT
A FEW MONTHS AGO.

215
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,022
WHAT HAPPEN TO HER?

216
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:46,104
( loud splash )

217
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:48,639
( rushing water )

218
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:50,041
( gasps )

219
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,721
<i>YOUR DAUGHTER HAS BEEN</i>
<i>A HUGE PART OF YOUR LIFE.</i>

220
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,625
IF YOU WEREN'T THROWN
OFF-GUARD BY THIS,

221
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:09,727
THEN SOMETHING
WOULD BE WRONG.

222
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:12,330
MY HUSBAND BLAMES ME
FOR HER DEATH.

223
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:14,399
HAVE YOU FORGIVEN YOURSELF?

224
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,136
THINGS HAVEN'T BEEN
THE SAME SINCE.

225
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:19,704
HE WON'T TALK TO ME.

226
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,506
HE WON'T TOUCH ME.  HE--

227
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:23,808
HE'S MARRIED
TO HIS JOB.

228
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,678
HE DOESN'T CARE.

229
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,816
I THOUGHT MOVING HERE
WOULD CHANGE THINGS.

230
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:33,684
AND WHY DID YOU
MOVE HERE?

231
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:35,653
WE NEEDED A CHANGE

232
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:38,122
AND MICHAEL LET ME DECIDE.

233
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:49,400
<i>( birds chirping )</i>

234
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,462
I WENT TO SEE
DR. FARNELL TODAY.

235
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:21,299
ARE YOU TAKING
YOUR MEDS?

236
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,236
THEY MAKE ME NUMB.

237
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,854
( mouths )

238
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:52,497
( faint scream )

239
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:55,733
( gasping )

240
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,137
<i>( wind gusts )</i>

241
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:03,207
( creaking )

242
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,702
<i>( school bell rings )</i>

243
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:34,272
WHO WAS THE LAST PERSON
TO SEE HER?

244
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:36,807
ARE YOU THE NEW GUY?
YOU'RE KINDA CUTE.

245
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:38,843
MISS WILCOX.

246
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:41,345
MILLER-COMMA-NATHAN,
HER BOYFRIEND.

247
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,948
- THEY LEFT THE PARTY EARLY.
- YEAH, WHERE WAS THE PARTY?

248
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,850
CAMPFIRE IN THE FOREST,
NEAR THE OLD GRA--

249
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:49,921
IT WAS NOTHING,
MR. POLICE-OFFICER-MAN.
NOTHING.

250
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:52,356
WAS THERE DRUGS, HUH?  BOOZE?
HAVING A GOOD TIME?

251
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:55,526
- WE DON'T KISS AND TELL.
- THEY'RE-- THEY'RE FINE, MAN.

252
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,428
WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

253
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,630
SHERIFF HENDRICKS, I MEAN,
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE US.

254
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:01,399
WHERE WERE THEY GOING?

255
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:03,501
WHAT'S A MAN LIKE YOU DOING
IN THIS HICK TOWN ANYWAY?

256
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:05,369
- MISS WILCOX!
- NOWHERE ELSE TO GO?

257
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,838
- WHY DON'T YOU
ANSWER THE QUESTION?
- HELL IF I KNOW.

258
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,473
- SUSIE DIDN'T TELL ME.
- YOU DON'T KNOW, HUH?

259
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:12,243
- I DON'T KNOW.
- I THINK YOU'RE LYING.

260
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,520
<i>( birds chirping )</i>

261
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,937
<i>( gusting wind )</i>

262
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,320
HELLO?

263
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:07,031
YOU AND SUSIE DUDLEY,
AS I UNDERSTAND, WERE
VERY GOOD FRIENDS?

264
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:09,567
<i>A LOT OF HISTORY THERE?</i>

265
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:12,003
DID SOMETHING
HAPPEN TO SUSIE?

266
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:13,537
YOU TELL ME.

267
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:14,972
ARE YOU SUGGESTING
THAT I'M KEEPING--

268
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:16,774
<i>WHAT I'M SUGGESTING</i>
<i>IS MAYBE</i>

269
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,744
- HER DISAPPEARANCE
IS DISTURBING TO YOU.
- ( scoffs )

270
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:23,314
BUT THIS IS
TOTALLY LIKE SUSIE.

271
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:25,483
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- <i>SHE'S ALWAYS RUNNING AWAY.</i>

272
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:28,586
SHE AND HER MOM WERE
ALWAYS AT IT.  I DIDN'T
THINK IT WAS A BIG DEAL.

273
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:30,821
I'M SURE SHE'S FINE.

274
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:33,758
JUST WANTS
THE ATTENTION.

275
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,493
WHERE'S HER BOYFRIEND
NATHAN?

276
00:21:35,495 --> 00:21:38,896
- I'LL GO PULL HIM FROM CLASS.
- Sheriff: YEAH.

277
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:40,831
SO TELL ME
ABOUT FRIDAY NIGHT?

278
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:43,000
SUSIE'S MOM SAID
THERE WAS A PARTY?

279
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:45,970
- YEAH, WE WENT
TO THE BOWLING ALLEY.
-  <i>YOU'RE LYING TO ME!</i>

280
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:49,674
OKAY, YOUR FRIENDS TOLD ME
THERE WAS A CAMPFIRE
BY THE WOODS.

281
00:21:49,676 --> 00:21:51,575
- <i>WHY ARE YOU LYING?!</i>
<i>- IT WAS NOTHING.</i>

282
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:52,910
THEN WHY LIE ABOUT IT?

283
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:55,646
Sheriff:
<i>MISS COOK.</i>

284
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:58,416
IF YOU WANT TO KEEP
ON TRACK WITH ATTENDING
THAT IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL,

285
00:21:58,418 --> 00:22:00,685
- I'D ADVISE YOU TO ANSWER THI--
-  <i>IT WAS JUST THIS</i>
<i>SENIOR-YEAR THING</i>

286
00:22:00,687 --> 00:22:01,986
<i>WITH A FEW OF US</i>
<i>HANGING OUT IN THE WOODS.</i>

287
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:04,588
Sheriff:
<i>IT DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE ELSE?</i>

288
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,724
NO SIR.

289
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:09,360
CAN I GO BACK
TO CLASS NOW?

290
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:18,869
EH, YOU KNOW
THERE'S NO NEED

291
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:22,039
TO SCARE THE HELL OUT
OF THESE KIDS, MICHAEL.

292
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,808
JUST FOLLOWING
YOUR ADVICE, HUH?

293
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:26,644
- AND OUR DUTY
TO PROTECT THIS TOWN.
- MURDER?

294
00:22:26,646 --> 00:22:28,879
MICHAEL, WE HAVEN'T HAD
THAT KIND OF TROUBLE HERE
IN A LONG TIME.

295
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:31,015
LOOK, PEOPLE TALK--
ESPECIALLY THESE KIDS.

296
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:33,884
- LAST THING I WANT IS
A PANIC, YOU UNDERSTAND?
- <i>( door opens )</i>

297

<i>BUT, UH, WE GOT</i>
<i>ANOTHER PROBLEM.</i>

299
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,860
NATHAN MILLER DIDN'T
SHOW UP FOR CLASS TODAY.

00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:15,619
- THEY BROUGHT HIM HERE.
- ( muttering in Spanish )

307
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,758
- Mike: WHERE ARE HIS FOLKS?
- BOTH DECEASED.

308
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,461
- THE BOY LIVES

A HOUSE DIVIDED UPON ITSELF

00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:28,044
WELL, SHERIFF HENDRICKS
AIN'T SAYING A WORD,

512
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:31,180
BUT I HEARD
SOMEONE SAW SUSIE

513
00:42:31,182 --> 00:42:33,616
SNEAKING AROUND
THE OLD GRANVILLE PLACE.

514
00:42:33,618 --> 00:42:35,919
<i>I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,</i>

515
00:42:35,921 --> 00:42:38,254
SOMETHING AIN'T RIGHT
ABOUT THAT HOUSE.

516
00:42:38,256 --> 00:42:40,023
DEVIL'S PLAYGROUND.

517
00:42:40,025 --> 00:42:42,625
THERE'S SOMETHING
EVIL OUT THERE.

518
00:42:42,627 --> 00:42:45,261
IT'S CURSED
AND IT ALWAYS WILL BE.

519

521
00:42:57,841 --> 00:42:59,309
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

522
00:42:59,311 --> 00:43:02,745
"I WILL RETURN TO MY HOUSE
FROM WHICH I CAME."

523
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:07,216
HE'S TALKING ABOUT
UNCLEAN SPIRITS.

524
00:43:07,218 --> 00:43:08,818
UNCLEAN SPIRITS?

525
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:13,156
YOU REALLY BELIEVE
IN THIS HOCUS-POCUS?

526
00:43:13,158 --> 00:43:15,124
THE HOUSE HE'S REFERRING TO
IS THE BODY.

527
00:43:15,126 --> 00:43:17,760
THE DEMON RETURNING
TO THE PLACE WHERE
IT ONCE DWELLED,

528
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:20,663
- BUT ONLY IF
IT'S AN EMPTY VESSEL.
- AN EMPTY VESSEL?

529

530
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:28,304
LUKE 11, VERSE 26,

531
00:43:28,306 --> 00:43:31,741
THE DEMON GOES
AND GETS SEVEN OTHER SPIRITS
MORE EVIL THAN ITSELF,

532
00:43:31,743 --> 00:43:34,010
AND THEY ENTER AND DWELL
WITHIN THE VACANT SOUL.

533
00:43:34,012 --> 00:43:36,713
THE PERSON ENDS UP FAR WORSE
THAN THEY WERE BEFORE.

534

TASTE IT.

541
00:44:10,181 --> 00:44:13,282

I BELIEVE THAT
THERE ARE DIFFERENT LEVELS

NO RITUALS, NO MAGIC.

549
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:41,711
IT ALREADY DWELLS
IN ALL OF US.

550
00:44:41,713 --> 00:44:43,179
THAT'S IT.
THAT'S THE BATTLE.

551
00:44:45,382 --> 00:44:47,383
THIS IS WAR.

552
00:44:47,385 --> 00:44:49,052
THERE'S NO NEUTRAL GROUND.

553
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:10,073
"BETHY BANKS."

554
00:46:03,494 --> 00:46:06,095
PROBABLY MAKE IT EASIER
IF YOU TALKED ABOUT IT.

555
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:09,866
NOTHING.

556
00:46:09,868 --> 00:46:12,368
RACHEL JUST LIKES
TO RATTLE MY CAGE.

557
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:14,804
MMM.  FROM WHAT
I SAW LAST NIGHT,

558
00:46:14,806 --> 00:46:16,906
IT LOOKED LIKE SOMETHING
WAS RATTLING HERS.

559
00:46:16,908 --> 00:46:18,541
SHE BLAMES HERSELF

560
00:46:18,543 --> 00:46:20,409
FOR OUR DAUGHTER'S DEATH.

561
00:46:20,411 --> 00:46:22,044
WHO DO YOU BLAME?

562
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:31,287
YOU SEE GOOD PEOPLE
GET SHIT ON ALL THE TIME

563
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:33,322
AND HE LETS IT HAPPEN.

564
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:37,827
SO I SAY TO HELL WITH HIM.

565
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:40,930
WHAT GOOD PEOPLE,
MICHAEL?

566
00:46:40,932 --> 00:46:42,965
THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN
GOOD AND EVIL.

00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:44,467
THAT'S THE GAME.

568
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:47,136
THE CURSE.

569
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:52,408
BUT REALLY WHO IS
INNOCENT WHEN STANDING HERE
BEFORE THE ALMIGHTY?

570
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:58,014
