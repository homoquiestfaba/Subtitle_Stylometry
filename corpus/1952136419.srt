[helicopter blades whirring]

4
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,455
It's shaping up to be
a beautiful day here

5
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,122
in the City of Angels,

6
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:07,792
where Republican presidential
candidate Patricia Lonsdale

7
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:11,166
makes a quick and somewhat
less serious campaign stop

8
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,762
to dedicate the opening
of a recreation center

9
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,900
for disadvantaged youth
in the Venice area.

10
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:19,376
This mark's the governor's
first trip to California.

11
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:27,410
# #

12
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:30,086
Due to an increased threat level,

13
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:33,007
the governor's visit will be
marked by heightened security.

14
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:36,287
Lonsdale's controversial plan
to clamp down on port security

15
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:39,854
and the importation of illegal goods
has sparked heated debate

16
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,924
even among her own supporters.

17
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,866
Detractors have called
her stance reckless

18
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,667
and warn of potentially dire
economic consequences

19
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,104
should she be elected.

20
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:50,802
Lonsdale has recounted that America
needs a strong leader

21
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:52,845
who is willing to make tough decisions.

22
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:57,315

reporting in Venice, California.

[people cheering]

24
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,189
So did you see the game last night?

25
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,227
Game?

26
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:42,761
More like a massacre.

27
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,195
Hate to be the poor guy
who had his money on Atlanta.

28
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:46,232
Don't worry, John.

29
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:47,926
I haven't welshed on a bet yet.

30
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,491
[laughs]

31
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:51,629
Hey, where's your body armor?

32
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:54,764
It's too hot.

33
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,138
Stupid.
- All clear.

34
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:57,176
Copy.

35
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:58,574
We're moving.

36
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,720
[cheers and applause]

37
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:10,820
Ladies and gentlemen,

38
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,485
please welcome
the Republican candidate for President,

39
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:17,655
Governor Patricia Lonsdale.

40
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,924
Welcome.

41
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:20,363
Please.

42
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:23,402
[cheers and applause]

43
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,840
We will offer these kids a choice,

44
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:37,349
an alternative
to a life behind bars.

45
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:47,088
With your support,
I promise an unprecedented war on crime.

46
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,720
Now it's on to Washington,
and let's win this thing.

47
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:52,765
[cheers and applause]

48
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:58,561
I'm gonna count on your vote.

49
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:01,607
Okay, thank you, thank you.

50
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:16,346

52
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,588
Let's go, let's go, this way!

53
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:26,632
[explosion]

54
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:34,098
[people shouting]

55
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:35,162
Come on!

56
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,318
The alley, it's clear.

57
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,807
[gunshot]

58
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,105
Get down.

59
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:12,974
Hey, don't worry.

60
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,274
Everything's gonna be all right.

61
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:15,541
Thanks.

62
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:17,549
But I think it's your friend down there
that needs your help.

63
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:21,553
Ridley, stay with the governor.

64
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:24,954
But you can't leave him out there.

65
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,321
[gunshot]

66
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:28,257
Ridley, if you're not gonna
do something, I will.

67
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,956
Hey, stop it.

68
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,225
If they wanted to kill him,
he'd be dead already.

69
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:35,790
They're trying to draw us out.

70
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:37,335
Look, if we leave him out there,

71
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:38,836
he's a dead man,
and you know it.

72
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,702
Can you live with that?

73
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:43,742
[sighs]

74
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:44,834
Okay.

75
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:47,573
Whatever happens,
you stay put, okay?

76
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,119
[gunshots]

77
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,755
19, 20, and you're out, my friend.

78
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:05,798
[gunshots]

79
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:10,496
[screams]

80
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,537
Hey, Boyd.
- Ridley.

81
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:13,037
Leave me, man.
I'm finished.

82
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:16,166
I'm not leaving you,
'cause you still owe me money.

83
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:17,209
Shut up.

84
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:18,800
I'm saving your life here.

85
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:22,815
[gunshots]

86
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:25,445
[laughs]

87
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:29,682
And I had the impression
I was dealing with the best.

88
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:32,452
Seems like you need a refresher course.

89
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:33,617
Now tell me,

90
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:36,457
what's the first rule of a bodyguard?

91
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,087
Fuck you.

92
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:39,131
Wrong answer.

93
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:42,358
Tell me again.

94
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:47,566
What's the first rule
of a bodyguard?

95
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:53,907
Never leave the client alone.

96
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,881
You remember that next time.

97
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,439
[gunshots]

98
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:02,955
[whimpering]

99
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:05,991
[gunshots]

100
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:15,501
[gasping]

101
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,609
[jumping rap music]

102
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,461
You sure this the place?

103
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,188
This is it.

104
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,825
Lovely.

105
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:28,937
You can do better than that.

106
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,737
Keep the left up.

107
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,107
Don't drop it.

108
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,975
Keep it up.

109
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:39,484
Come on, put something behind
those punches.

110
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,042
Don't stop moving.

111
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,314
Don't stop moving.

112
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:43,377
The minute you stop...

113
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:44,753
Is the moment you die.

114
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,092
Hey, hey.

115
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:50,094
What are you doing down here?

116
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:51,129
Huh?

117
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,323
How long's it been, two years?

118
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,263
Oh, try three.

119
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,994
So why didn't you
ever stop by,

120
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:57,592
pick up the phone or something?

121
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,730
I was beginning to think maybe
you didn't like me anymore.

122
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:02,740
Oh, it's just like-
I wanted to,

123
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:04,537
but you know how it is.

124
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,737
Yeah.

125
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:08,473
You remember Ozu?

126
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,742
Sure.
Hi, Ozu.

127
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,079
He just stepped up
as my right-hand man

128
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:14,619
ever since your extended
leave of absence.

129
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:18,521
Well, well,
guess it's true what they say.

130
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,116
Those who can, do.

131
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:24,629
Those who can't
wind up in shit holes like this.

132
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:28,565
Still haven't lost your razor-sharp wit,
Ozu, have you?

133
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:31,034
Looks like you're really
coming up in the world, Ridley.

134
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:34,266
Guess this is what happens
when you lose your edge.

135
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,864
Ozu.

136
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,569
Wait in the car.

137
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:41,837
Sorry about that.

138
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,973
I don't know how you do it, Graver.

139
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,677
Huh.

140
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:49,084
Yes, he's still pissed
about the whole-you know.

141
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,885
I'm sure you haven't come
all the way down here to talk about this.

142
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:55,416
No, it's not.

143
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,086
I've got a potential client, John,

144
00:09:57,163 --> 00:10:00,496
big government witness.

145
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:02,329
I need the best for this job.

146
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:05,097
I don't do this anymore.

147
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:07,264
This client specifically
asked for you,

148
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,103
knows that you're the best
in the business.

149
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,574
I'm not in the business.

150
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:11,735
You're part of the package.

151
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:15,770
Without you, I lose the account.

152
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:20,584
All right, fine.

153
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:23,053
I'm in way over my head here, okay?

154
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:27,149
So call this what you want,
a personal favor,

155
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:29,319
a professional courtesy, whatever.

156
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:33,195
Just do this one for me, John.

157
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:39,502
Look, when I walked away
from this three years ago,

158
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:40,561
it was for keeps.

159
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,607
You don't mean that.

160
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,198
I know you.

161
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:44,264
You weren't there.

162
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:46,903
You didn't have to watch her die.

163
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,508
Take a good look at yourself.

164
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:55,520
You don't belong here.

165
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,021
You're better than this.

166
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:58,215
No, I'm not.

167
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,781
I'm through with it.

168
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,192
[chuckles]

169
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:05,890
You always were
one stubborn son of a bitch.

170
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:14,638
Anyway, in case you change your mind.

171
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:16,698
I won't.

172
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,368
Nice card.

173
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:21,413
Thank you.

174
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:32,984
Don't stop.

175
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:36,028
Come on.

176
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:38,817
Where are you going?

177
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,449
Salvitti called in sick today.

178
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:41,754
You're joking, right?

179
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:43,260
No, I'm not.

180
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,923
So you'd rather spend your time
with a bunch of gangbangers

181
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:47,397
than with me.

182
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:48,763
Honey, you don't understand.

183
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:49,801
No, I understand.

184
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,234
I understand all right.

185
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:55,330
I understand that John Ridley died
in the alley that day,

186
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:57,671
because the man who came back

187
00:12:57,743 --> 00:13:00,576
isn't the man I fell in love with
five years ago.

188
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:04,013
I don't know who you are anymore.

189
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,607
You're like a stranger to me.

190
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:12,587
When you come back,
don't expect to find me here.

191
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:14,626
Okay.

192
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:16,991
John, you need
to work this out for yourself.

193
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:19,121
I will.

194
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,195
John Ridley.

195
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:00,238
I'm looking for Graver.

196
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:02,570
Training ground.

197
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,233
Thanks.

198
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:12,284
[explosions and gunfire]

199
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:36,237
Be one step ahead of them at all times.

200
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:39,277
[shouting]

201
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,515
[screaming]

202
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:53,751
Ouch.

203
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,190
Well, well.

204
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:02,291
Seems we have a genuine celebrity
joining us today.

205
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:08,398
Let's all give a warm welcome
to John Ridley.

206
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:14,878
They don't make them
like this anymore:

207
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:19,975
washed-out fools who can't keep
their clients alive.

208
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:25,854
That's something this man
knows all about.

209
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,390
Isn't that right?

210
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,452
You know, Ozu, if looks could kill,
I would be half dead.

211
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,967
Go to hell.

212
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,734
Been there;
done that.

213
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:43,172
Ozu!

214
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:46,643
You have a class to teach, don't you?

215
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:50,977
To be continued, Ridley.

216
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,978
I didn't think I would be
seeing you again

217
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,023
for quite some time, John.

218
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,024
Does that job offer still stand?

219
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:04,059
What changed your mind?

220
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,821
Let's just say I'm ready again.

221
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:09,993
Well, I can't tell you how good it is

222
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,627
to have you back on board, John.

223
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:14,138
Okay then.

224
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:16,333
What say we go meet the client?

225
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:18,376
Sounds like a plan.

226
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:21,004
Tell me, John, how's your Spanish?

227
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,344
Probably a little rusty.

228
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:25,679
Come on.

229
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:28,720
[gunshots and explosions]

230
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,071
So tell me again,
why are we in Spain?

231
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:52,007
It's not just Spain, John.

232
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:53,408
It's Barcelona.

233
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:56,471
Wow, somebody pinch me.

234
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:57,674
You gonna answer my question?

235
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,980
Part of our deal with the client.

236
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:01,019
Speaking of which...

237
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,654
"Lee Maxwell."

238
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:08,522
This is all you got, no photos?

239
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:10,027
That's it.

240
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:11,722
Feds are playing this one
close to the vest.

241
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:14,823
All we know is he's
a high-price contractor,

242
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,529
international circuit,
strictly freelance.

243
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:19,866
So how did they finally get him?

244
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:21,269
They didn't.

245
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:26,039
A few weeks ago, Maxwell waltzes
into the American embassy here,

246
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:27,339
turns himself in.

247
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:30,041
Says he's ready
to name names, dates,

248
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:32,049
the works.

249
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:33,311
Just like that?

250
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:36,548
Just like that.

251
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:37,714
So why Barcelona?

252
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,758
One of the conditions
for his testimony

253
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:42,794
was that he be kept here
until his court date.

254
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:47,997
Look, all I know is,
he testifies in three days.

255
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,865
Your job is to keep him alive that long.

256
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:53,364
Oh, and one other thing.

257
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,703
Part of the deal for his testimony

258
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:58,800
was that you be brought in
as his personal bodyguard.

259
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:02,404
Oh, yeah.

260
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,711
Almost forgot.

261
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:06,944
Got a little present for you.

262
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,145
Wow, more surprises?

263
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,620
Your guns.

264
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:14,147
Don't get any crazy ideas
about actually using it.

265
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:15,853
This gets better and better.

266
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,709
Maxwell has flipped.

267
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:39,342
Obviously, this poses a grave threat
to the organization.

268
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:43,218
So exactly what does
Maxwell have on us?

269
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,448
Everything.

270
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,286
One of our inside sources

271
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:48,223
tells me he's cut a deal
with the U.S. government,

272
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:52,024
and he's scheduled to testify
before a grand jury in three days.

273
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:54,861
We can't allow that to happen.

274
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:58,027
This matter must be dealt with swiftly

275
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:02,039
and with the utmost urgency.

276
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,807
Lareina.

277
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,645
How are things progressing
on your end?

278
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:12,911
The wheels are in motion.

279
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:16,148
We should have closure
within 24 hours.

280
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:18,382
I hope so, for all our sakes.

281
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:22,826
It'll be clean, no loose ends.

282
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,329
What about this new security guy
they brought in?

283
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:28,230
Our source on the inside assures us
he won't be a problem.

284
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,234
I'm counting on it.

285
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:32,099
Now if there's nothing further,

286
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,901
I'm sure we all have
other matters to attend to.

287
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:35,940
Thank you, gentlemen.

288
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,373
Wait a minute.

289
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:42,436
You're putting the fate
of our entire operation

290
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,708
in the hands of this broad?

291
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,781
I take it you don't approve.

292
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,717
No, sir, of course not.

293
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:51,915
Since you see fit
to question my choice...

294
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,620
The one on the steps.

295
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:06,571
[screams]

296
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:21,617
Sorry about your man.

297
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:24,289
Thank you, gentlemen.

298
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:36,527
<i>Bon dia, senyor.</i>

299
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,763
Hi.

300
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:43,001
Well, this is it.

301
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,543
Well, they seem
to take good care of Mr. Maxwell.

302
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:46,635
Oh, yeah.

303
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:49,681
He made sure of that.

304
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:58,288
Excuse me, sir.

305
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,086
May I have a word with you?
- Is there a problem?

306
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:01,455
No, no, no.

307
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:04,154
Well, there is Mr. Maxwell's,
or rather, should I say

308
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:08,757
the bill of Mr. Maxwell.

309
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,267
[laughs]

310
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:15,102
Lobster, caviar, oysters,
and two cases of Cava Reserve.

311
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:18,040
Never thought a killer could be
such a prima donna.

312
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:22,240
They tailor, shoemaker, valet,
and in-room masseur, sir,

313
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:23,679
that will go on another bill.

314
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:27,378
If I could just have your signature?

315
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,420
Sorry, you've got the wrong guy.

316
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,012
Uncle Sam's picking up this one.

317
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:34,058
Send him the bill.

318
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,168
Morning.

319
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:47,330
He's with me.

322
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,945
So, Graver, this him?

323
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:56,139
Agent Franklin Aames.

324
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:57,181
John Ridley.

325
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:58,216
Hi.

326
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,113
For the record,
I think this is bullshit.

327
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,418
There is no way just one man's
gonna cover this guy.

328
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,855
I don't care how good you are.

329
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:08,449
Nice to meet you too.

330
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:10,886
Excuse me.

331
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:13,487
Mr. Maxwell.

332
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:15,192
I really hope you like this music.

333
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,360
He hasn't stopped
playing this shit since he got here.

334
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:21,902
Talking about me again
behind my back, Franklin?

335
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:25,739
Now, that's not very polite.

336
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:29,577
And you haven't even
introduced me to our new guest.

337
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:31,912
I'm gonna have to take this up
with your superiors.

338
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:33,848
I'm sorry, Mr. Maxwell.

339
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,083
Your, uh-
your bodyguard is here.

340
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:39,885
Oh.

341
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:43,189
Excellent.

342
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:45,456
[sighs]

343
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:49,728
Let me prepare myself
for the big moment.

344
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,175
Holy shit.

345
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:08,782
You mother... fucker.

346
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:12,556
Let's all chill the hell out.

347
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:13,591
Okay?

348
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:16,627
[beautiful choral music]

349
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:23,759
Well, that was exciting, huh?

350
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:25,166
Wasn't it?

351
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:28,206
[laughs]

352
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:32,607
Well, I think I'm gonna go clean up.

353
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:36,644
[laughs]

354
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:53,722
Look, I'm sorry it had
to go down this way,

355
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:54,959
but my hands were tied.

356
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:57,797
I promised Maxwell
I wouldn't say anything.

357
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:02,806
You've got every right in the world
to want to kill him.

358
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:03,863
I don't blame you.

359
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:04,909
But face it.

360
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:11,905
That's not gonna happen, not now,
not with the feds involved.

361
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:15,077
He knows all the names and faces
of the criminal underworld,

not to mention the present government
who have used his services for years.

Look, I don't care
what I have to do

364
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,193
or who I have to go through.

365
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:26,492
This guy is a dead man.

366

Understand?

367
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:29,256
I have no problem with that.

368
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:30,858
Excuse me?

369
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:32,426
You're absolutely right.

370
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:34,563
The son of a bitch deserves to die.

371
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,266
But not just yet.

372
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:39,401
All you have to do is keep him alive
for three more days.

373
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,308
Three days,

374
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,541
till he testifies.

375
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:46,208
After that, frankly,

376
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:50,015
nobody's gonna give a good goddamn
what happens to him.

377
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:52,955
Think about it, John.

378
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:54,855
You finally got a chance
to even the score.

379
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,057
I bet you lie awake at night
just thinking about

380
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:01,394
what you'd like to do to him.

381
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:08,495
Well, now's your chance.

382
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:11,071
But you got to decide now.

383
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:12,507
You don't take this job,

384
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:14,738
you'll never see
Maxwell again, ever.

385
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:20,877
They'll bury him so deep,
even a psychic won't be able to find him.

386
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:22,010
Just think,

387
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:25,215
three days from now,
he's all yours.

388
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:29,192
Plus, you get a nice fat paycheck
on top of it.

389
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:31,627
It's win-win all the way around.

390
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,061
I don't get it.

391
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:34,098
Why me?

392
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:35,928
What does he want with me?

393
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:38,993
Who knows how his sick mind works?

394
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,059
Just play along.

395
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:45,508
Babysit his sorry ass for three days.

396
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:47,306
Then...

397
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:53,441
So what's it gonna be, John?

398
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:57,477
I need an answer.

399
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:09,191
Everything secure?

400
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:12,236
Yeah, no thanks to your boy.

401
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:18,409
Ridley, a word of advice.

402
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:21,445
Now, that is government property
we got in there.

403
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:23,208
In other words,
his ass belongs to Uncle Sam.

404
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:25,647
You got me?

405
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:27,309
Now, I'm gonna be right outside.

406
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:29,717
If I hear you try anything,

407
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:32,416
I'll be through that door faster
than you can speed-dial your mother.

408
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,048
Do you understand me?

409
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:36,150
Yeah, I just didn't think
a tough guy like you

410
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:38,491
would have a soft spot
for a piece of shit like Maxwell.

411
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:40,531
I don't.

412
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,861
I'm just doing my job.

413
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:46,199
I suggest you do yours.

414
00:26:54,379 --> 00:27:00,113
So you're ready to do this?

415
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:03,882
Yeah, let's get this
dog and pony show on the road.

416
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,822
Just try not to let him get to you.

417
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:08,688
Okay?

418
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,318
Sure.

419
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:14,927
Our field offices
are a couple of blocks away.

420
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,558
It's a private line.

421
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,000
Don't hesitate to use it.

422
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:19,036
What's the matter?

423
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:20,128
You don't trust me anymore?

424
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,307
[chuckles]

425
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:29,703

426
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:34,809
Remember, three days.

428

Ridley.

429
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:54,430
It's good to see you again.

430
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:59,071
But where are my manners, right?

431
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:01,467
Let me offer you something.

432
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:05,812
Would you like something to drink,
a little local beer?

433
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:08,910
Some wine?

434
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:10,079
A little scotch maybe?

435
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:11,122
You like that?

436
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,156
Oh, wait.

437
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:13,190
Am I bad?

438
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:14,350
[chuckles]

439
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:16,121
Am I bad?

440
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,422
You can't drink, right?

441
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:20,760
That's right, no drinking on the job.

442
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:23,027
It dulls your reflexes.

443
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:24,068
Yeah.

444
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:25,796
[chuckles]

445
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,737
Come on, you know,
you got to relax, Ridley.

446
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:31,332
You're way too uptight.

447
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:34,037
Maybe you can't drink, but I can.

448
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:40,745
So how about
you share one with me, no?

449
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:46,350
Cheers.

450
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:49,359
Mm, it's nice.

451
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:54,524
Uh, something to eat maybe,
like a little surf and turf,

452
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:55,793
a little paella?

453
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:58,461
I could have the room service
set it up for you.

454
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:02,939
Here we go,
some nice Cuban cigars.

455
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:05,703
How about it?

456
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:08,268
Cuban, just for you.

457
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:10,041
Fuck it.

458
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:11,605
They'll kill you anyway, those things.

459
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:14,550
[laughs]

460
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:17,452
Stop with the silent treatment,
Ridley, huh?

461
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:19,683
You and I,
we have a lot of catching up to do.

462
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:21,892
Nothing?

463
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,484
That's it?

464
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:25,859
Well, how about some music?

465
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,763
Here, a little Brahms, huh?

466
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:31,301
Stravinsky,

467
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:34,065
Vivaldi?

468
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:35,868
Vivaldi is powerful.

469
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,807
It's like the planets, the moon, stars.

470
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:42,479
No passion?

471
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:44,310
You're gonna like this.

I prefer hip-hop.

480
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:12,300
Don't push it, Ridley.

481
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:13,469
Don't push it.

482
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:31,794
So, Ridley, you're not serious
about this hip-hop stuff?

483
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:32,830
Shut up.

484
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:34,228
Pardon me?

485
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:35,630
I didn't catch that.

486
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,531
I said shut up.

487
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:39,570
Got that?

488
00:30:41,806 --> 00:30:43,467
My God, it speaks.

489
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:44,838
What a breakthrough.

490
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:47,207
Listen, asshole,
I'm only gonna say this once.

491
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:49,303
Just go over there,
fix yourself another drink,

492
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,506

I've had enough of this game.

Let's stop prolonging
the inevitable, huh?

how to push my buttons.

I hear that.

00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:41,750
Truth be told, he had me
jumping through a few hoops too.

I got to admit,

00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:00,926
What?

550
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:03,023
You thought you could
just call me up out of the blue

551
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,399
and I'd welcome you with open arms?

552
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,097
You know how I feel about you,

553
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:11,073
about what you do,
about everything.

554
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:12,803
So why are you calling me?

555
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:14,139
Listen, people change.

556
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:15,406
No.

557
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,540
You'll never change.

558
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,140
I-
listen, let me just explain.

559
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:22,652
First rule of the bodyguard,
never leave the client.

560
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,687
Give me the phone.

561
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:25,278
Give me the fucking phone.

562
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,892
You weren't thinking of leaving

563
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,557
without at least saying good-bye,
were you?

564
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:36,600
Mr. Maxwell-

565
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:37,634
I wasn't running.

566
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:39,033
I told you I had to make a phone call.

567
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:40,127
Do me a favor.

568
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:42,035
Lend me your cuffs.

569
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:43,630
Come on,
you got to be kidding me.

570
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:46,677
I'm not.

571
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:57,045
All right, Ridley, come on.

572
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:58,110
The joke's over, all right?

573
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:01,590
Take these off.

574
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,889
Why don't you pour me one of those?

575
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:05,326
Who was that girl?

576
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,194
None of your business.

577
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:11,132
Come on, can't you
pour me a drink, all right?

578
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:12,226
A drink?

579
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:13,270
Yeah.

580
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:19,534
Why didn't you say so?

581
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,840
Now you just sit there
and shut your mouth,

582
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:22,880
or I tape it shut.

583
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:30,544
You're a real class act, Ridley.

584
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:33,017
A real class act.

585
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:04,281
So, Ridley,

586
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:09,054
this bodyguard thing, I mean,
why do you do it?

587
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:11,560
I mean, I could never understand
why someone would take a bullet

588
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:13,256
meant for somebody else.

589
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:18,200
I mean, is it the money?

590
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:19,395
'Cause I don't get it.

591
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,734
You could never understand.

592
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:25,401
Well, let me take
a wild guess, all right?

593
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:27,535
Is it some nonsense about integrity

594
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:29,546
and duty and honor?

595
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:30,581
Maybe.

596
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:31,615
Yeah.

597
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:34,412
Sounds good, but I don't buy it.

598
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:37,511
I guess this is what separates
someone like me from someone like you.

599
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:38,555
Really?

600
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:40,955
And what exactly is someone like me?

601
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:43,118
From where I'm standing,
you are the scum of the Earth.

602
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:45,094
Why, 'cause I kill people
for a living?

603
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:47,926
Yeah, for starters.

604
00:37:56,607 --> 00:38:02,443
<i>La porta se esta tancando.</i>

605
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:03,775
It's the way of the world, Ridley.

606
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:05,816
I didn't create it.

607
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:09,876
I'm just a little piece of the machinery.

608
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,216
Besides, it's all business.

609
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,756
If I didn't do it,
somebody else would.

610
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:14,518
That's supposed to make it right?

611
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:18,085
No.

612
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:19,459
It just makes it the way it is.

613
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:41,614
Hold it.

614
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:43,847
Where's the regular guy?

615
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:44,888
Called in sick.

616
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:45,979
Flu or something.

617
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:50,223
[electronic beep]

618
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:56,957
Whoa, so on top of being
a stone-cold killer,

619
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:58,194
you're also a pervert.

620
00:38:58,269 --> 00:38:59,258
Nice.

621
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,668
That's not the way it is, Ridley.

622
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:02,069
What's the matter?

623
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:04,107
You don't think I'm capable
of doing anything good?

624
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,473
The only thing you're capable of
is pain, misery, and death.

625
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:08,034
You know what?

626
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:10,580
When you're dead and buried,
nobody's gonna give a shit.

627
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:12,741
Nobody's gonna care one bit.

628
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:13,875
Got any keys or coins?

629
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:15,282
No.

630
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:18,255
[beeping]

631
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:19,687
What's this?

632
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:21,748
Sorry, forgot.

633
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,023
Just got it done last week.

634
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:27,064
Ouch.

635
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:29,099
That's got to hurt.

636
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:31,361
Not as much as this.

637
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:34,404
[muffled gunshots]

638
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:53,079
You know why I picked you
to be my bodyguard, Ridley?

639
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:54,681
Tell me.

640
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:57,227
Who better to guard me than the man
who wants to kill me the most?

641
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,497
You got to love the irony, huh?

642
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:05,091
[chuckles]

643
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:06,830
[knocking at door]

644
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,269
Yes?

645
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:10,102
Room service.

646
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:19,540
[muffled gunshots]

647
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:22,586
[distant crashing]

648
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:27,858
[gunshots]

649
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:35,493
Get me out of these.

650
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:42,773
[gunshots]

651
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:53,244
Fuck you.

652
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:54,614
Fuck me?

653
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:55,674
[gunshot]

654
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,082
Let me guess.

655
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:03,490
They sent you here to dispatch me?

656
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,859
Would that be a fair assumption?

657
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,124
[gun clicking]

658
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:09,393
[explosion]

659
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:13,028
[tires squealing]

660
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:19,976
What the hell was that
standing out in the open shit?

661
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:21,602
They teach you that in assassin school?

662
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:23,374
I wanted to see how good
you really are.

663
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:26,211
Look, if anyone's gonna kill you,
it's gonna be me.

664
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:27,580
Got that?

665
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:28,618
Stop the car.

666
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:30,278
What?

667
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:31,981
I just said stop the car.

668
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:33,921
You can take a leak
at the next gas station.

669
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:34,958
This is no joke.

670
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:36,458
Stop the car now.
- Forget it.

671
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:38,085
If you feel like getting out,
be my guest.

672
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:42,865
If you insist.

673
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:45,561
[tires screeching]

674
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:48,605
[loud crashing]

675
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:55,435
Maxwell.

676
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,904
Damn!

677
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:37,850
[doorbell buzzing]

678
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:38,889
Catherine.

679
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:41,791
What are you doing here?

680
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:44,259
Look at you.

681
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:45,295
You're a woman now.

682
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:47,353
Well, I'm not a child anymore.

683
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:48,762
I make my own decisions now.

684
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:51,494
It's my life,
and you're not a part of it.

685
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,560
I just want you to give me a chance
to make it up to you.

686
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:54,604
Too late for that.

687
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:58,403
You show up after all these years
and decide to play the loving father?

688
00:42:58,475 --> 00:42:59,737
Look, things are different now.

689
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:00,970
Oh, really?

690
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:02,569
So you've given up killing for a living?

691
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:07,811
I'm gonna turn myself in.

692
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:11,744
I am.

693
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:13,483
I promise you,
it's gonna be different now.

694
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:17,254
It's not gonna be like it was.

695
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:19,228
Hey, Houdini, let's go.

696
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:20,957
I'll make this short and sweet.

697
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:24,091
I don't ever want to see you again, okay?

698
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:26,432
So take your trained gorilla here,

699
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:29,165
and get out of my life.

700
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:31,969
Who is Miss PMS?

701
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:34,476
Huh?

702
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:37,139
Let's go.

703
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:39,479
[phone rings]

704
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:40,517
Ridley.

705
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:41,915
Yeah, it's me.
We got hit hard.

706
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:43,146
They wiped out the entire suite.

707
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,949
Christ.

708
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:45,989
You okay?

709
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:47,353
Yeah, I'm fine.

710
00:43:47,424 --> 00:43:48,584
What about-

711
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:50,092
Don't worry.

712
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,684
He's still in one piece for the moment.

713
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:53,093
Okay.

714
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:55,188
I'm gonna get you to a safe house.

715
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:58,234
Where are you now?

716
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,701
Somewhere in the Eixample Esquerra

717
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:01,260
from the looks of it.

718
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:02,930
It's your call, John.

719
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:05,532
Just tell me how you want to work this.

720
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:07,236
Okay, remember my friend
Rogelio's place,

721
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,676
the one I used
on the Scagnetti case?

722
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:09,838
Yeah, sure.

723
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:12,438
The nightclub over in Barri Gótic, right?

724
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:14,143
That's the one.

725
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:15,651
After dark, okay?

726
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:17,914
We'll be there.

727
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:20,389
Don't worry.

728
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:22,584
You'll be sucking down brandy
and caviar again in no time.

729
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,719
You assured me
this little problem of ours

730
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:26,023
would be dealt with,

731
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:29,588
and now you tell me
this seemingly simple task

732
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,864
has been somehow-
how did you put it?

733
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:35,598
Fucked up?

734
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,732
I can't afford incompetence.

735
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:39,708
Our window is rapidly closing.

736
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:41,608
If you cannot get the job done,

737
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:45,012
maybe it's time
I find someone who can.

738
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:47,346
If you'll excuse me
for saying so, Mr. Tolkin,

739
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:48,510
you'll recall it was your man,

740
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:50,985
I mean,
woman who was in charge-

741
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:54,582
If you're referring to Lareina,
she would never disappoint me.

742
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:57,218
You gave me your personal guarantee

743
00:44:57,294 --> 00:45:00,422
that this bodyguard would be
of no consequence.

744
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:02,761
Just a minor setback, sir.

745
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:05,734
But in a short while,
all your troubles will be over.

746
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:07,236
I can assure you.

747
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:10,330
Your assurances don't mean
very much right now, Graver.

748
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:14,173
Just get the job done.

749
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:18,044
I don't want to have
this conversation with you again.

750
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:19,082
Understood?

751
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:21,916
Yes.

752
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:30,351
We wouldn't have been in this mess
if you'd brought me in earlier.

753
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:33,021
Just send over a half dozen
of your best men.

754
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:36,362
Here's the address.

755
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:38,526
You're making a mistake.

756
00:45:38,602 --> 00:45:40,331
Let me go alone.

757
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:44,135
I'll have everything cleaned up
nice and tidy.

758
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:47,177
Just do what I tell you.

759
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:59,348
Oh, oh, oh.

760
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,050
Don't fight the feeling.

761
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:06,028
Oh, oh, oh.

762
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:09,065
[jumping hip-hop music]

763
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:27,116
I'm here for Rogelio.

764
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:44,632
It's amazing what passes
for entertainment these days.

765

00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,609
[laughs]

767
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:30,740
Holy shit, man.
Holy fucking shit.

768
00:47:30,814 --> 00:47:34,375
I can't believe this,
right in front of me.

769
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:39,047
Bigger-than-life Ridley,
John fucking Ridley.

770
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:40,817
Hey, Rogelio, nice to see you.

771
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:45,487
Man, haven't seen you in,
like, forever.

772
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:47,894
Well, didn't catch the name, buddy.

773
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:49,557
Maxwell.

774
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:51,260
Any friend of Johnny's
is a friend of mine.

775
00:47:51,335 --> 00:47:52,893
That's great.

776
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:55,666
Now, I know you didn't come
to Barcelona

777
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:57,366
just to see my ugly mug again.

778
00:47:57,441 --> 00:47:58,408
No.
- So what's up?

779
00:47:58,475 --> 00:47:59,874
In some kind of trouble?
Need my help?

780
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:01,035
Whatever you need, you got it.

781
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:02,442
Just say it, Johnny.

782
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:04,139
Come on, what's the 411?
What's the dealio?

783
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:05,181
Break it down for me.

784
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:06,409
Hey, take it down a notch, okay?

785
00:48:06,483 --> 00:48:08,212
We just need a place
to hold up for a while.

786
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:09,946
We're kind of hot right now.

787
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,715
You mean you're back
in the game?

788
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:13,813
Well, all-freaking-right.

789
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:15,415
Just like the good old days,
huh, Johnny?

790
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:16,857
Just like in the good old days.

791
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:18,292
Anything you need.

792
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:19,329
Just let me know.

793
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:20,920
I can give you 100%, okay?

794
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:23,432
For right now,
we just need some food.

795
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,467
We're hungry, right?

796
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:26,832
Yeah, food.

797
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:27,871
Say no more;
say no more.

798
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:28,905
I'm on it.

799
00:48:28,972 --> 00:48:30,234
You guys make yourselves at home.

800
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:32,400
Kick back, relax, chill.

801
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:33,738
Be back in a flash.

802
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:35,334
Okay.

803
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:36,777
Hey, you want some girls with that?

804
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:39,816
No, thanks.

805
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:46,317
I take it this gentleman here
is a friend of yours.

806
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:48,187
Well, he's a very good friend of mine.

807
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:50,123
I guess it's something
you wouldn't understand.

808
00:48:50,193 --> 00:48:52,286
Yeah, well, I never had
much use for friends, you know.

809
00:48:52,362 --> 00:48:55,661
Oh, how come
that doesn't surprise me?

810
00:48:55,732 --> 00:48:57,461
[laughs]

811
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:02,866
Yeah.

812
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,670
Rogelio and I, we did a few
campaigns together.

813
00:49:05,742 --> 00:49:07,733
Rogelio was a mercenary?

814
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:09,244
You've got to be kidding me.

815
00:49:09,313 --> 00:49:10,837
That guy?

816
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:12,882
He was the best demolition man
in the business.

817
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:16,408
He was really talented
in blowing stuff up.

818
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:21,253
But deep down in his heart,
he always wanted to be a rock star.

819
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:23,520
Guess this is as close as he got.

820
00:49:23,593 --> 00:49:25,584
Yeah, tell him it's called
self-denial, you know?

821
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:26,686
All right?

822
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:28,492
Tell him to get over it.

823
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:30,965
You really are a heartless bastard,
aren't you?

824
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:32,626
Yeah, well, it comes
with the territory.

825
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:34,466
You know, in my line of work,
that's the way it is.

826
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:36,369
That's bullshit.

827
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,067
[chuckles]

828
00:49:57,894 --> 00:49:58,986
Gustav.

829
00:49:59,062 --> 00:50:01,724
Bon appetite.

830
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:03,129
Get a room, okay?

831
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,225
Yeah, bon appetite.

832
00:50:05,302 --> 00:50:08,271
[pulsing dance music]

833
00:50:14,244 --> 00:50:15,211
So who's this guy?

834
00:50:16,646 --> 00:50:17,670
Do you really want to know?

835
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:22,549
Ahh.

836
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:31,822
Let me get this straight.

837
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:34,455
You mean to tell me
that guy sitting in there,

838
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,624
right in my office,
is the same son of a bitch

839
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,792
that killed your last client?

840
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,028
Yeah.

841
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:40,797
And almost fucking ruined
your entire life?

842
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:41,838
Yes.

843
00:50:41,905 --> 00:50:44,567
And you're his bodyguard?

844
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:46,438
Yes.

845
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:47,704
Excuse me for asking,

846
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:50,042
but have you completely
lost your fucking mind?

847
00:50:50,113 --> 00:50:53,173
I think that's a distinct possibility,
yeah.

848
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:54,274
I can't believe this.

849
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:56,615
How can you be so calm about it?

850
00:50:56,686 --> 00:51:00,053
How come you're not in there right now
laying the smack down on his ass?

851
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:02,717
Rogelio, that's a long story.

852
00:51:02,793 --> 00:51:04,385
I don't get it, man.

853
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:05,553
I just don't get it.

854
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:07,722
I mean, call me crazy,
but if it was me,

855
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:09,891
two seconds after that motherfucker

856
00:51:09,966 --> 00:51:11,866
walked back into my life,
he'd be dead.

857
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:15,132
Look, all I used to think about
was killing this guy.

858
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:17,730
I must have murdered him
a thousand times in my sleep.

859
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:19,776
But now...

00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:23,436
[sighs]

861
00:51:23,513 --> 00:51:26,676
I just want this job to be over with.

862

And I want to keep on
with the rest of my life.

Sorry, big boy.

But this one's all mine.

874
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:17,613
You, my friend,

875
00:54:17,687 --> 00:54:21,088
need to get in touch with your,
shall we say,

876
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:22,624
feminine side.

Are you okay?

Whoa, man.

880
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:40,272
Shooting that bitch
was a real tattoo moment.

881
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:41,571
A what?

882
00:54:41,645 --> 00:54:43,738
You know, something that will
stay with you forever.

884
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:45,815
That's funny.

885

Hey, I'm sorry.

886
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:48,383
I did not know this was
going to happen.

887
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:49,509
Oh, don't worry about it.

888
00:54:49,586 --> 00:54:51,213
I just wish I could have
helped you out more.

889
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:53,552
I think you did just fine, bro.

890
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:54,590
I owe you one.

891
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:55,625
A big one.

892
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:57,683
Yeah.

893
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:05,531
What, are you waiting
for an invitation?

894
00:55:05,602 --> 00:55:06,569
Move over.

895
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:08,035
I drive.

896
00:55:08,104 --> 00:55:10,572
I didn't know boosting cars
was part of your repertoire.

897

[tires squealing]

899
00:55:12,776 --> 00:55:13,743
Graver sold you out.

900
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,402
Fuck, no way.

901
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:17,571
Who else knew we were gonna
be there in the first place?

902
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:18,705
No way Graver would set me up.

903
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:19,749
That's not possible.

904
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:20,976
Come on, Ridley.

905
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:22,712
One thing you got to learn,
in this business,

906
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:23,753
anything is possible.

907
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:24,809
Shit, Catherine.

908
00:55:24,888 --> 00:55:27,356
Catherine, the girl from earlier?

909
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:28,755
Yeah, we got to go back and get her.

910
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:30,087
What, the one that despises you?

911
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,252
No way.
Forget it.

912
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,592
Listen, I got no time to sit here
and argue with you, okay?

913
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:34,994
I'm not gonna explain it to you.

914
00:55:35,065 --> 00:55:36,089
Her life's in danger.

915
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,531
We got to go back and get her.

916
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,125
Listen, asshole,
I am sick and tired of playing games.

917
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:41,363
So who is that girl?

918
00:55:41,438 --> 00:55:42,837
She's my daughter.

919
00:55:42,906 --> 00:55:44,703
I don't believe this.

920
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:46,765
Listen, if I'm a target,
then so is she.

921
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,504
We got to go back and get her
before they do.

922
00:55:48,578 --> 00:55:50,307
What makes you think
they even know about her?

923
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:52,439
'Cause there's only one person
who knows about her.

924
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:55,313
And that one person is Graver.

925
00:55:55,385 --> 00:55:56,352
Rogelio was right.

926
00:55:56,419 --> 00:55:57,613
I'm losing it.

927
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:59,712
All right, we'll go back to the city.

928
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:27,047
<i>Café?</i>

929
00:56:27,117 --> 00:56:28,084
<i>Y quieres algo mas?</i>

930
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:29,982
<i>No? Vale.</i>

931
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,179
Catherine.

932
00:56:31,254 --> 00:56:33,745
What the hell are you doing here?

933
00:56:33,823 --> 00:56:34,790
Listen to me.

934
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:35,825
We've got no time to explain.

935
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:36,859
You have to come with us, okay?

936
00:56:36,926 --> 00:56:37,893
It's not safe here.

937
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:38,950
You must be joking.

938
00:56:39,028 --> 00:56:40,325
I'm not going anywhere with you.

939
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:41,364
Catherine, listen-

940
00:56:41,431 --> 00:56:42,898
Get your goddamn hands off me.

941
00:56:42,966 --> 00:56:44,797
<i>Catherine, Te estan molestando</i>
<i>esos hombres?</i>

942
00:56:44,868 --> 00:56:46,597
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>
<i>estos caballeros ya se iban.</i>

943
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:48,967
Look, you have every right
in the world to hate me, all right?

944
00:56:49,038 --> 00:56:50,300
But it's not safe here.

945
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:51,340
You have to come with us now.

946
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:52,375
[gunshot]

947
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:55,411
[people screaming]

948
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:58,072
[gunfire]

949
00:56:58,148 --> 00:56:59,740
What are you gonna do
to get us out of here?

950
00:56:59,816 --> 00:57:00,908
I'm working on it.
Relax.

951
00:57:00,984 --> 00:57:01,951
Well, do something.

952
00:57:02,018 --> 00:57:03,280
[gunshots]

953
00:57:03,353 --> 00:57:04,581
Stay down;
don't move.

954
00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:05,621
I'll be back.

955
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:08,953
[gunshots]

956
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:17,664
Where's your bodyguard now,
Maxwell?

957
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:20,134
Where the hell is he?

958
00:57:20,203 --> 00:57:23,866
[engine revving]

959
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,840
You need an invitation?

960
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:28,878
[gunshots]

961
00:57:47,997 --> 00:57:50,397
You know, really,
I know you're not as dumb as you look.

962
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,128
When you gonna get it
through your thick head

963
00:57:52,202 --> 00:57:53,169
that Graver sold you out?

964
00:57:53,236 --> 00:57:54,464
When are you gonna accept it,

965
00:57:54,537 --> 00:57:55,834
and what are you gonna do
about it?

966
00:57:55,905 --> 00:57:57,167
I still say that's bullshit.

967
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,265
Graver would never do that to me.

968
00:57:59,342 --> 00:58:00,570
You know, you better talk straight,

969
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:01,871
or you're gonna end up
as dead as Lonsdale.

970
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:03,435
Say that again.

971
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:05,504
Say that again,
and see what happens.

972
00:58:05,582 --> 00:58:06,549
You heard me, huh?

973
00:58:06,616 --> 00:58:07,640
You want to see what happens?

974
00:58:07,717 --> 00:58:08,877
I'm gonna show you what happens.

975
00:58:08,952 --> 00:58:10,510
Stop it.
What the fuck are you doing?

976
00:58:10,587 --> 00:58:12,350
It doesn't help anything.

977
00:58:12,422 --> 00:58:13,753
You know what?

978
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:14,790
She's right.

979
00:58:14,858 --> 00:58:16,155
No more talk.

980
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,462
Huh, how's that?

981
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:21,019
Huh, huh?
What are you gonna-

982
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:24,066
[grunts]

983
00:58:29,939 --> 00:58:30,906
What happened?

984
00:58:30,974 --> 00:58:32,032
I didn't hit you that hard.

985
00:58:32,108 --> 00:58:34,076
It's not you.

986
00:58:34,143 --> 00:58:35,405
You still hit like a pussy.

987
00:58:36,813 --> 00:58:37,973
What's wrong?

988
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:39,571
[groans]

989
00:58:39,649 --> 00:58:41,674
I've got to take my pills.

990
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:47,921
Ahh.

991
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:50,789
Saw about a dozen doctors.

992
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:52,259
They all said the same thing.

993
00:58:52,328 --> 00:58:56,264
They said it's terminal,
you know.

994
00:58:56,332 --> 00:58:57,890
So either way I'm dead,

995
00:58:57,967 --> 00:58:59,491
so it doesn't matter.

996
00:58:59,569 --> 00:59:02,163
I guess my body's
turning against me.

997
00:59:02,238 --> 00:59:03,865
I can't blame it though.

998
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:06,408
How long?

999
00:59:08,344 --> 00:59:10,471
I don't know,
two, three months tops.

1000
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:13,607
It seems like I'm getting paid back

1001
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:15,344
for all the horrible things I did,
you know.

1002
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:19,921
Payback's a bitch, huh, Ridley?

1003
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:21,388
So this is what it's all about.

1004
00:59:21,457 --> 00:59:22,583
That's why you're testifying.

1005
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:23,683
No.

1006
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,523
Seems like I want
to show some people

1007
00:59:25,595 --> 00:59:26,892
that I still got some good in me.

1008
00:59:33,102 --> 00:59:34,467
You have your mother's eyes.

1009
00:59:34,537 --> 00:59:35,504
You know that?

1010
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:38,405
Her hair.

1011
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:42,069
You're the spitting image of her.

1012
00:59:44,347 --> 00:59:45,939
I just want you to know
that leaving you both

1013
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:47,312
was the hardest thing I ever did.

1014
00:59:48,952 --> 00:59:51,113
Then why did you?

1015
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:56,484
Catherine, because I knew
as long as I did what I did,

1016
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,322
both of you would always be in danger.

1017
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:01,090
I wouldn't have that.

1018
01:00:01,164 --> 01:00:03,894
Why you didn't just quit then?

1019
01:00:06,869 --> 01:00:09,497
You can't quit, Catherine.

1020
01:00:09,572 --> 01:00:10,937
First time you do what I do, that's it.

1021
01:00:11,007 --> 01:00:11,974
You're in it for life.

1022
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:17,411
I just want you to know
that I never stopped loving your mother.

1023
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:20,074
And I never stopped loving you.

1024
01:00:20,149 --> 01:00:21,946
Okay?

1025
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:26,515
Come on.

1026
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:30,320
I think it's better we get out of here.

1027
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:48,801
Wait, wait, stop the car.

1028
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:51,142
Stop the car.

1029
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:55,410
Where in God's name are we?

1030
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:57,453
This is Rogelio's country house.

1031
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,147
It used to be like my second home.

1032
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:00,655
We'll be safe here.

1033
01:01:35,058 --> 01:01:38,027
[knocking at door]

1034
01:01:41,497 --> 01:01:43,863
Johnny boy.

1035
01:01:43,933 --> 01:01:45,594
[laughs]

1036
01:01:45,668 --> 01:01:53,404
Since you're here,
you must be still in trouble, right?

1037
01:01:53,476 --> 01:01:54,443
Nice, huh?

1038
01:01:56,779 --> 01:01:57,803
Come on, guys.

1039
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,849
Get in here already.

1040
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:05,010
You've got to be kidding.

1041
01:02:08,858 --> 01:02:09,825
You see?

1042
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:14,192
This is my grandma, my grandfather.

1043
01:02:14,263 --> 01:02:17,391
When I travel the world,
I buy things.

1044
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:19,196
I got this in China.

1045
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:20,633
I got this in Japan.

1046
01:02:20,703 --> 01:02:22,864
Well, actually, this is fake.

1047
01:02:22,939 --> 01:02:24,236
And that horse over there,

1048
01:02:24,307 --> 01:02:28,004
it was a real horse
that I bought in Japan.

1049
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:30,375
Come on, come on.

1050
01:02:30,446 --> 01:02:33,745
So who is your decorator,
the Marquis de Sade?

1051
01:02:33,816 --> 01:02:34,908
Well, you know what they say.

1052
01:02:34,984 --> 01:02:36,281
A man's home is his castle.

1053
01:02:36,352 --> 01:02:39,446
Don't believe I've had the pleasure.

1054
01:02:39,522 --> 01:02:41,820
Rogelio, please meet Catherine.

1055
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:43,290
Welcome to Camelot, my lady.

1056
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:44,849
<i>Mi casa, su casa.</i>

1057
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:45,894
Thanks.

1058
01:02:45,962 --> 01:02:47,452
So where is the dungeon?

1059
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:49,930
Down the hall and to the left.

1060
01:02:49,999 --> 01:02:52,593
Beautiful and sarcastic:
I like.

1061
01:02:52,668 --> 01:02:54,226
And of course
you remember Lee, huh?

1062
01:02:54,303 --> 01:02:55,270
Of course.

1063
01:02:55,338 --> 01:02:59,035
Yeah, charmed, I'm sure.

1064
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:02,043
Ozzie used to own it back in the '70s.

1065
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:05,046
Got to maintain that
rock and roll image, you know?

1066
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:06,206
Hey, Rogelio, listen.

1067
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:07,271
What happened in the club-

1068
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:08,578
Oh, forget about it.

1069
01:03:08,651 --> 01:03:11,518
You know, I was getting bored
with that joint anyway.

1070
01:03:11,587 --> 01:03:13,885
Probably would have ended up
torching it myself

1071
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:17,016
for the insurance money.

1072
01:03:17,093 --> 01:03:19,254
So what's the plan, man?

1073
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:20,295
Well, I don't know.

1074
01:03:20,363 --> 01:03:23,230
I make it up as I go along.

1075
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:26,632
Well, looks like you won't be
going anywhere for a while.

1076
01:03:26,702 --> 01:03:28,033
Drink, anyone?

1077
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:29,071
Drink?
Yeah.

1078
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:32,801
How about bring the whole bottle?

1079
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:36,276
Wow.

1080
01:03:58,067 --> 01:04:00,433
Hey, mind if I come in?

1081
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:03,472
No.

1082
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:09,673
Who's that?

1083
01:04:09,745 --> 01:04:10,712
My father.

1084
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:14,511
He always taught me to be strong,

1085
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:19,521
always pushed me to try harder,
to do better, to be the best.

1086
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:20,851
[chuckles]

1087
01:04:20,923 --> 01:04:26,623
He wanted to toughen me up
for the real world.

1088
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:31,099
But one day, he got sick:
lymphoma.

1089
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:35,194
And I had to watch this man who always
seemed like Superman to me

1090
01:04:35,271 --> 01:04:37,899
waste away to nothing.

1091
01:04:37,974 --> 01:04:44,641
And there was nothing
I could do about it.

1092
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:47,376
Is he the reason you became
a bodyguard?

1093
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:49,281
[chuckles]

1094
01:04:49,352 --> 01:04:52,116
Maybe.

1095
01:04:52,188 --> 01:04:54,986
Maybe I was just tired of being
on the wrong side.

1096
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,225
Yeah.

1097
01:05:09,705 --> 01:05:11,263
Why do you still keep this thing?

1098
01:05:13,676 --> 01:05:15,541
As a reminder,

1099
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:18,944
as a reminder of a mistake
I will never make again.

1100
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:29,018
So, Maxwell, tell me.

1101
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:31,025
Why did you let me live?

1102
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,593
Was it another one
of your noble gestures

1103
01:05:34,664 --> 01:05:36,632
of wanting to do something good
before you die?

1104
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:38,564
Maybe.

1105
01:05:38,634 --> 01:05:39,862
You see, in my line of work,

1106
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:41,927
you get used to pulling
the trigger for someone else.

1107
01:05:42,004 --> 01:05:43,801
It's so anonymous.

1108
01:05:43,873 --> 01:05:45,340
Faces don't mean anything.

1109
01:05:45,408 --> 01:05:51,108
After while, you know,
you get a little dead inside.

1110
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:56,015
So in that alleyway
when I saw you leave your client,

1111
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:58,417
protect your friend,

1112
01:05:58,487 --> 01:06:01,854
as stupid as I thought that was,

1113
01:06:01,924 --> 01:06:03,653
there was something
very honorable in that.

1114
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:06,595
Like I said before,

1115
01:06:06,662 --> 01:06:09,222
I can never understand how you guys
take a bullet for somebody else.

1116
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:10,356
I could never do that.

1117
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:16,097
But what you did-
yeah.

1118
01:06:16,172 --> 01:06:18,470
I just thought maybe you should
die in a better place

1119
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:19,530
than some alleyway.

1120
01:06:19,608 --> 01:06:21,405
What?

1121
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:24,446
Now I'm supposed to be
thankful for this?

1122
01:06:24,513 --> 01:06:26,845
I'm just telling you the way it is.

1123
01:06:29,852 --> 01:06:33,549
Listen, I got an idea
how we could make things right.

1124
01:06:33,622 --> 01:06:35,249
What do you mean?

1125
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:36,450
You call Graver.

1126
01:06:36,525 --> 01:06:38,356
You tell him I'm ready
to surrender,

1127
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:40,224
but tell him only
to him personally.

1128
01:06:40,296 --> 01:06:44,289
If you're right about Graver,
you're setting yourself up.

1129
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:45,493
You're gonna be a dead man.

1130
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:48,162
Yeah.

1131
01:06:48,237 --> 01:06:51,138
Don't you love the irony?

1132
01:06:51,207 --> 01:06:54,176
Make the call.

1133
01:07:02,418 --> 01:07:06,286
Shit.

1134
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:09,085
I guess the old saying is true.

1135
01:07:09,158 --> 01:07:10,989
If you want something done right,

1136
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:13,153
you've got to do it yourself.

1137
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:20,362
How very true.

1138
01:07:20,436 --> 01:07:24,566
And since you seem incapable
of following through on your promises,

1139
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,403
the task has fallen to me.

1140
01:07:26,475 --> 01:07:28,568
I've given Mr. Tolkin my word

1141
01:07:28,644 --> 01:07:32,444
that this matter would be resolved
once and for all.

1142
01:07:35,418 --> 01:07:36,385
All right.

1143
01:07:36,452 --> 01:07:39,717
Let's finish this, shall we?

1144
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:43,190
You, get the men.

1145
01:07:45,294 --> 01:07:47,785
You're gonna love this.

1146
01:07:53,035 --> 01:07:56,801
[machinery whirring]

1147
01:07:56,872 --> 01:08:00,808
Just a few souvenirs
from some of our previous ops.

1148
01:08:00,876 --> 01:08:03,436
Always thought this stuff
might come in handy some day.

1149
01:08:06,715 --> 01:08:09,240
Nice, huh?

1150
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:10,945
Let's see what we got here.

1151
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:12,248
It's a-

1152
01:08:12,321 --> 01:08:17,020
Heckler & Koch PSG1,
650 millimeter heavy-duty barrel,

1153
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:19,891
four grooves, right-hand twist,

1154
01:08:19,962 --> 01:08:21,657
Hendsoldt scope with illumination,

1155
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:25,393
target-type pistol grip.

1156
01:08:25,468 --> 01:08:26,435
Nice.

1157
01:08:26,502 --> 01:08:28,766
That's what I was gonna say.

1158
01:08:35,511 --> 01:08:36,478
Let's go to work.

1159
01:09:13,449 --> 01:09:16,418
[electronic beeping]

1160
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:35,562
Hey.

1161
01:09:35,638 --> 01:09:39,369
Just thought you might
need something to warm you up.

1162
01:09:39,441 --> 01:09:41,068
It gets pretty chilly out here.

1163
01:09:41,143 --> 01:09:42,371
Yeah.

1164
01:09:42,444 --> 01:09:44,935
I take it you spend a lot
of time at fountains.

1165
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:50,145
Well, I do some of my best
thinking at fountains.

1166
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:55,122
That's what I was doing;
thinking.

1167
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:57,523
I don't know.

1168
01:09:57,593 --> 01:10:00,187
I feel all mixed up.

1169
01:10:00,262 --> 01:10:02,492
That man in there-

1170
01:10:02,565 --> 01:10:04,032
That man?

1171
01:10:04,099 --> 01:10:06,863
You mean your father?

1172
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:12,499
Yeah, my father.

1173
01:10:12,575 --> 01:10:15,544
I still have problems saying that.

1174
01:10:20,916 --> 01:10:24,249
You can't change the past,
but you can change the way you feel.

1175
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:27,915
It's never too late for this.

1176
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:32,222
Maybe it's time to forgive
and move on.

1177
01:10:32,294 --> 01:10:34,387
And what about you?

1178
01:10:34,463 --> 01:10:38,297
Can you forgive him?

1179
01:10:39,702 --> 01:10:41,602
[sighs]

1180
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:44,764
I don't know.

1181
01:10:48,644 --> 01:10:52,512
Hey.

1182
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:53,548
Take this one here.

1183
01:10:53,616 --> 01:10:54,583
Thanks.

1184
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:57,619
It's nice and warm.

1185
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:07,562
They're coming.

1186
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:08,597
How many?

1187
01:11:08,664 --> 01:11:09,824
Enough to go around.

1188
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:10,990
Rogelio, take her upstairs.

1189
01:11:11,066 --> 01:11:12,033
Get her safe.

1190
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:15,332
Go ahead.

1191
01:11:17,473 --> 01:11:19,566
I got this from Rogelio.

1192
01:11:19,642 --> 01:11:21,041
I can never understand these things.

1193
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:23,408
They're uncomfortable as hell.

1194
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:29,611
But I think it's time
you got a new one, right?

1195
01:11:29,685 --> 01:11:31,846
Thank you.

1196
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,012
Come on.

1197
01:11:33,088 --> 01:11:34,953
Let's go welcome them.

1198
01:11:57,046 --> 01:11:59,037
Let's get this over with quickly.

1199
01:11:59,114 --> 01:12:01,344
Let me handle this.

1200
01:12:01,417 --> 01:12:03,009
It's personal.

1201
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:08,782
Good to see you again, John.

1202
01:12:10,059 --> 01:12:13,961
So where is he?

1203
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:15,257
He's dead.

1204
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:16,662
Dead?

1205
01:12:16,732 --> 01:12:17,790
Ah.

1206
01:12:17,866 --> 01:12:20,130
Guess he pissed me off
one too many times.

1207
01:12:20,202 --> 01:12:21,169
I had to kill him.

1208
01:12:21,236 --> 01:12:23,761
Why don't I believe you, John?

1209
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:25,306
[chuckles]

1210
01:12:25,374 --> 01:12:26,341
You tell me.

1211
01:12:26,408 --> 01:12:27,375
I know you too well.

1212
01:12:27,443 --> 01:12:29,536
That's not your style.

1213
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:35,413
You always did have
a warped sense of honor.

1214
01:12:35,484 --> 01:12:38,612
Now let's stop playing games.

1215
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:39,915
Where the hell is he?

1216
01:12:39,988 --> 01:12:41,853
First tell me why.

1217
01:12:41,924 --> 01:12:46,384
I think you owe me that much.

1218
01:12:46,462 --> 01:12:48,453
For old time's sake, huh?

1219
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:50,725
Sure, why not?

1220
01:12:50,799 --> 01:12:53,165
I did it for the money,

1221
01:12:53,235 --> 01:12:56,068
a lot of money.

1222
01:12:56,138 --> 01:12:59,130
That's what it's all about
in the end, isn't it?

1223
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:01,142
Wave enough green
under someone's nose,

1224
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:03,178
and they're liable to do anything.

1225
01:13:03,245 --> 01:13:04,678
Like sell out a friend.

1226
01:13:04,747 --> 01:13:06,942
You were the perfect scapegoat, John.

1227
01:13:07,015 --> 01:13:11,782
Who better to pin Maxwell's death on
than the man whose life he ruined?

1228
01:13:11,854 --> 01:13:13,116
Nobody would ever question it.

1229
01:13:13,188 --> 01:13:15,520
And I'd be home free.

1230
01:13:15,591 --> 01:13:17,957
But you had to play the hero.

1231
01:13:18,026 --> 01:13:23,692
Anyway, I'd love to stay here
and chat all night,

1232
01:13:23,766 --> 01:13:26,064
but I have a deadline to meet,
you understand.

1233
01:13:26,135 --> 01:13:29,832
I promise I'll make it quick,
for old time's sake.

1234
01:13:31,607 --> 01:13:36,442
Now, where is he?

1235
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:40,405
What if I don't feel like telling you?

1236
01:13:40,482 --> 01:13:41,449
Face it, John.

1237
01:13:41,517 --> 01:13:44,077
The odds aren't in your favor.

1238
01:13:44,153 --> 01:13:47,122
Well, maybe we can help
even things up.

1239
01:13:47,189 --> 01:13:48,781

01:15:14,209 --> 01:15:17,110
Catherine, give me another clip.

1252
01:15:19,214 --> 01:15:20,203
Get my pills.

1253
01:15:28,323 --> 01:15:30,757
Stop, Ridley.

1254
01:15:30,826 --> 01:15:32,350
No more heroics.

1255
01:15:32,427 --> 01:15:36,193
You should have killed me
when you had the chance.

1256
01:15:36,265 --> 01:15:39,257
I'm going to leave you
with more than just a scar.

1257
01:15:51,747 --> 01:15:54,716
[grunting]

1258
01:15:57,486 --> 01:16:00,421
Oh, damn, damn.

1260
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:06,127
Oh, damn.

1261
01:16:06,194 --> 01:16:08,128
Mr. Maxwell.

1262
01:16:13,602 --> 01:16:19,063
I'm afraid your services
will no longer be required.

[gunshots]

1264
01:16:27,816 --> 01:16:29,579
It's okay.

1265
01:16:29,651 --> 01:16:30,913
It's okay.

1266
01:16:30,986 --> 01:16:32,146
I had to do it.
- I know.

1267
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:34,245
I had to.

1268
01:16:38,827 --> 01:16:41,796

1270
01:17:14,863 --> 01:17:17,696
[metallic scraping]

1271
01:17:23,772 --> 01:17:26,741
[metal clanging]

1272
01:17:43,925 --> 01:17:46,894
[gunshots]

1273
01:17:50,599 --> 01:17:51,566
[explosion]

1274
01:17:59,074 --> 01:18:02,043
[both grunting]

1275
01:18:10,118 --> 01:18:13,087
[distant gunfire]

1276
01:18:19,561 --> 01:18:21,426
[coughing]

1277
01:18:21,496 --> 01:18:22,520
Are you okay?

1278
01:18:22,597 --> 01:18:23,825
Yeah, I'm all right.
- You sure?

1279
01:18:23,899 --> 01:18:24,991
Okay.
- Let's go.

1280
01:18:25,067 --> 01:18:26,034
Maxwell.

1281
01:18:31,673 --> 01:18:33,538
You've been one colossal pain
in my ass, Maxwell.

1282
01:18:33,608 --> 01:18:34,575
Leave her alone.

1283
01:18:34,643 --> 01:18:35,610
She knows nothing.

1284
01:18:35,677 --> 01:18:37,338
True.

1285
01:18:37,412 --> 01:18:39,243
But it's not a good idea
to leave any witnesses.

1286
01:18:39,314 --> 01:18:40,713
You of all people should know that.

1287
01:18:47,589 --> 01:18:49,318
You want me, Ridley?

1288
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:50,358
You got to go through him.

1289
01:18:50,425 --> 01:18:53,223
You prepared to do that?

1290
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:00,261
Yeah.

1291
01:19:00,335 --> 01:19:02,929
[gunshot]

1292
01:19:08,376 --> 01:19:11,345
[gunshots]

1293
01:19:17,619 --> 01:19:19,052
Say hello to the devil.

1294
01:19:19,121 --> 01:19:21,954
[gunshot]

1295
01:19:24,092 --> 01:19:25,389
Why did you do it?

1296
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:27,860
You shot me.

1297
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:29,726
I don't believe it.

1298
01:19:29,798 --> 01:19:30,787
How'd you know?

1299
01:19:32,667 --> 01:19:33,634
I didn't.

1300
01:19:37,506 --> 01:19:40,475
[laughter]

1301
01:19:43,578 --> 01:19:46,547
[siren wailing]

1302
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:57,014
Hey, Aames.

1303
01:19:57,092 --> 01:19:58,457
Glad that you could make it in time.

1304
01:19:59,895 --> 01:20:01,419
Why the hell didn't you call me sooner?

1305
01:20:04,499 --> 01:20:06,433
This guy hasn't been giving you
any trouble, has he?

1306
01:20:06,501 --> 01:20:08,025
You have no idea.

1307
01:20:10,205 --> 01:20:12,332
Didn't we have fun tonight, huh?

1308
01:20:12,407 --> 01:20:13,635
[laughs]

1309
01:20:13,708 --> 01:20:14,675
Just like the good old days, Johnny.

1310
01:20:14,743 --> 01:20:16,108
Like the good old days.

1311
01:20:16,178 --> 01:20:18,942
We got two hours to get you
on a flight back to the States.

1312
01:20:19,014 --> 01:20:20,982
I hope you're ready.

1313
01:20:22,017 --> 01:20:23,712
I'm ready as I'll ever be.

1314
01:20:32,227 --> 01:20:33,194
Thanks, Rogelio.

1315
01:20:33,261 --> 01:20:36,230
You take care, Johnny.

1316
01:21:03,992 --> 01:21:06,153
So you think
you're gonna be all right?

1317
01:21:07,762 --> 01:21:09,093
I guess.

1318
01:21:16,271 --> 01:21:19,240
[people talking at once]

1319
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:35,083
Over here, please, sir.

1320
01:21:35,156 --> 01:21:36,646
How did it go in there?

1321
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:38,283
It felt good to get it off my chest.

1322
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:39,327
I'll tell you that.

1323
01:21:39,394 --> 01:21:40,759
Bye-bye, Victor.

1324
01:21:40,829 --> 01:21:42,353
Have a nice life.

1325
01:21:47,202 --> 01:21:48,601
You ready to meet your new world?

1326
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:50,604
Bring it on.

1327
01:21:51,873 --> 01:21:53,397
Let's go.

1328
01:21:53,475 --> 01:21:56,444
[people talking at once]

1329
01:22:03,084 --> 01:22:04,278
Shit.

1330
01:22:04,352 --> 01:22:06,183
Good-bye, Ridley.

1331
01:22:06,254 --> 01:22:09,223
[gunshots]

1332
01:22:22,704 --> 01:22:24,729
[sighs]

1333
01:22:24,806 --> 01:22:27,468
Hey, how do I look, huh?

1334
01:22:27,542 --> 01:22:29,237
I got to look good
for the cameras, right?

1335
01:22:29,311 --> 01:22:31,142
You look fine, Daddy,

1336
01:22:31,212 --> 01:22:34,978
just fine.

1337
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:36,984
Please don't try to talk.

1338
01:22:40,422 --> 01:22:41,514
Now we're even.

1339
01:23:33,041 --> 01:23:36,044
[dramatic music]
