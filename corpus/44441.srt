1
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,475
[My name's Frankie.]

2
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,393
[Frankie Delano.
And l'm a professional watcher.]

3
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,673
[That's what l do. l try to stay
in the shadows and watch.]

4
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,956
[The man who employs me is Angelo.]

5
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,759
[Angelo Allieghieri, who is
considered a generous man..]

6
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,354
[..by some
and a very bad man by others.]

7
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,310
[But good or bad, he is a father
first and foremost and has,..]

8
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,631
[..for years, had me watch
his daughter who, by the way,..]

9
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,150
[..doesn't even know
she's his daughter,..]

10
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,914
[..which really complicates things.]

11
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,075
[ln the last few months,
Angelo has been having me..]

12
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,197
[..film messages to his daughter.
lt's kinda like he's gettin'..]

13
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,430
[..his life in order,
which kinda makes me nervous,..]

14
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,636
[..like he knows something
l don't.]

15
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,874
Hey, Frankie?
You want me to say..

16
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,517
..something for you? You know,
put in a good word or something?

17
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,830
Please, Angelo, it's gonna
embarrass me, okay?

18
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,514
Come on!
You embarrass too easy.

19
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,877
Frankie, if she ever leaves
that sorry excuse of a husband.

20
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,119
You can't keep doing what you
are doin' for me. Understand?

21
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,796
Now, Frankie, watch out.

22
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:51,831
For what?

23
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,479
Watch out for the one..

24
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,034
..who feels pain..

25
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,752
..and wants you to know it.

26
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,716
All right.

27
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,356
Turn it on.

28
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,509
You know,
after so many years,..

29
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,518
..it's become like
a pool of memories to me,..

30
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,797
..never knowing
if those memories are real,..

31
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,118
..or if they're simply
what l want to remember.

32
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,998
Because all l have left
to join me to that world is her.

33
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,031
[See, that's what Angelo
had always said..]

34
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,873
[..that she was all he had left.
But that wasn't exactly true..]

35
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,918
[..because, even though l never
made a big deal out of it,..]

36
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,560
[..he also had me. See,
l pretty much loved Angelo..]

37
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,631
[..like you would your own father.]

38
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,437
Come on.

39
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,559
Before we lose 'em.

40
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,319
[So it was hard for me, too,
having to stay invisible..]

41
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,914
[..as her world fell apart,
after she'd given in..]

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,230
[..to that husband
and sent their little son off..]

43
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,515
[..to some distant
boarding school.]

44
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,756
l see him! ln the plane!

45
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,352
Rawley! Rawley!
lt wasn't my idea!

46
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,433
l didn't mean to send you away,
baby. Oh, l love you!

47
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,910
Jennifer! Jesus! God, what
are you doing? Get back in the car!

48
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,549
Look at him.
He's driving crazy.

49
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,270
A willow in the wind.

50
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,159
- Get back in the car!
- l just want to see his face!

51
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,073
Jennifer, for goodness' sake,
l'm shutting the sun --

52
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,317
Get back!
Just get back in!

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,194
Bloody hell!

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,278
l feel her sadness.
l mean, sending away..

55
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,154
..her only child.

56
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,034
l don't understand that.

57
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,915
But then, l do.

58
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,153
Jennifer, for God's sake,
what exactly is the trauma here?

59
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,437
Our little soldier is going off to
military school. lt'll make him a man.

60
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,910
- He's seven! - And you're
acting about the same age.

61
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,274
Have you ever considered,
lightening your hair?

62
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,510
- What?
- Lightening your hair.

63
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,076
Well, l thought maybe it'd,
you know, brighten your mood.

64
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,434
You know, this can be
corrected, Angelo, seriously,..

65
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,512
..it would be my pleasure.
- You can't. You know that.

66
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,150
- l understand.
- That's right. Keep the distance.

67
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,668
The distance.

68
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,429
We send our son off to military
school where he can be surrounded..

69
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,353
..by nothing but boys. You fire
the gardener. The place is a mess.

70
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,874
The furniture is in storage,
we can't even afford to get it out..

71
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,871
..because you invested
in some other mining stock..

72
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,077
..or something or other. We don't
even have a home! Brilliant!

73
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,348
- Where's my FedEx package, or did
you misplace it? - lt's there. - Oh!

74
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,592
How can you be so blasé?
Don't you miss Rawley?

75
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,672
You know, you really have
to get a grip on this.

76
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,519
A grip on what?

77
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,950
Seriously.
What more could you want?

78
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,554
- You keep asking me that.
- Okay, okay, fine.

79
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,074
- So go out and get a job.
- Well, l had a job, remember?

80
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,754
But you said a mother's place
was in the home.

81
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,592
Besides,
who would hire me now?

82
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,037
Everything we funnel..

83
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,669
..through
to that family of theirs..

84
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,159
..he manages to lose.
Or squander.

85
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,518
Look at her now.
She's skinny.

86
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,035
Probably, nerves.

87
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,916
You know, when l'm gone,..

88
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,471
..you're gonna have
to take over. Be sure..

89
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,433
..and fatten her up.

90
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,589
l'm afraid you're
not goin' anywhere, okay?

91
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,913
Everybody's goin'..

92
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,275
..somewhere.

93
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,190
There's no need for the cannon.

94
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,875
Twenty-two should be all we need.

95
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,715
Let the old man finish his meal.

96
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,514
An ill wind
is blowing this way, ladies.

97
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,749
l am so messed up.

98
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,878
l just sent my baby boy
off to military academy.

99
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,793
Oh God! l am so wired.
Am l having a heart attack?

100
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,472
- ls that what's going on?
- No, sweetie,..

101
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,279
..men get heart attacks. We don't.
- We don't. We don't.

102
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,272
Can you breathe?
Okay, blow out. That's it.

103
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,511
- Oh, God!
- You know what?

104
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,796
Momma's little helper
to the rescue.

105
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,233
l want you to take one of these.

106
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,392
Sweetie, take two. And leave
all your troubles behind. Trust me.

107
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,710
- What are these? - Her husband
gives them to his patients.

108
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,916
Well, for me,
he triples the dosage.

109
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,158
Jennifer, l said take two pills.
How many did you take?

110
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,470
l don't know!
Just what you told me!

111
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,193
- Well, bon voyage, darlin'.
- Oh, my God.

112
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,110
Scusi.

113
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,915
Officer!
ls there a problem here?

114
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,350
- You're in a no parking zone.
- We're talkin' minutiae here.

115
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,271
What does Angelo see
in a guy like that?

116
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,999
l could run circles
around that pain in the ass.

117
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,910
- Does Malatesta know about....
- Does Malatesta what?

118
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,594
Know about this? There's
a lot the old man don't know.

119
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,036
As for you, don't sweat
the small shit. Do you hear me?

120
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,314
This frickin' song.

121
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,233
lt makes my heart weep
every time l hear it.

122
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,436
Yeah.
l get a twinge, too.

123
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,474
A twinge? What kind of person
just gets a frickin' twinge..

124
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,391
..when you hear a song like this?

125
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,756
So, what do you get?

126
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,316
Let me get this straight.
Are you sayin' that this little..

127
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,312
..distance here is not negotiable?
- The law's the law.

128
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,550
Okay. Well, how about
if l just pull it forward?

129
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,676
And how about
l just call for some backup?

130
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,159
How about you not?

131
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,718
- lf you weren't so cute.
- You watch it!

132
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:46,517
Nice shine.
Cheap after-shave.

133
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:58,150
Must be Bruno.

134
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,599
Any last words?

135
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,672
Yeah. Try the clams.
They're fabulous.

136
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,032
Hey! lt's a good thing l didn't
see you earlier, otherwise..

137
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,678
..l would had
to give you a ticket!

138
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,512
Sorry for the inconvenience.

139
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,757
Hello?

140
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,472
What?

141
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,550
l'm on my way.
l'll be right there.

142
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,319
My son has a temperature
of a hundred and three.

143
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,392
Oh. He'll be all right.
You want some company?

144
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,629
l gotta go.

145
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,471
Later, lucky ones.

146
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,275
Good afternoon,
ladies, and welcome.

147
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,558
We have a very special treat
for you this afternoon.

148
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,633
All due to the very hard work
of our own Jennifer Barrett.

149
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,596
Please join me
in welcoming a celebrated author,..

150
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,791
..Marcello Della Rosa!

151
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,992
lt seems there are no men.

152
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,192
Pity.

153
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,472
lf you will indulge me,..

154
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,638
..l would prefer to let
my work speak for itself.

155
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,433
l've taken the liberty
of bringing ''Our Way'',..

156
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,197
..the book l published last year.

157
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,753
Then, if you must,
ask your questions.

158
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,319
But please be gentle.

159
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,277
''He stood on the cliffs
of Apollonia di Mare,..''

160
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,756
''..the cliffs of his Sicilia.''

161
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,236
''All about him swirled sounds
as holy as God's silence.''

162
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,030
''The cry of the sailor''.

163
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,193
''He was home''.

164
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,399
''With ghosts of ships
that came before''.

165
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,188
''Come, you Romans,
and you Greeks''.

166
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,550
''You dark-eyed,
Spanish moors''.

167
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,312
''l've waited
too long to come home, he thought''.

168
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,276
''For time is a thief,
and he never gets caught.''

169
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,194
Never, Jennifer.

170
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,037
Oh!

171
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,794
Jesus Christ!

172
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,029
Now, Jennifer, this is not
the time for another..

173
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,712
..of your scenes.
- My scenes?

174
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,552
lt's not
what it looks like.

175
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,916
You have no clue
what it looks like.

176
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,317
You're doing her in the pool,
and l get Mister Missionary?

177
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,709
- Jen-Jen...
- Don't you ''Jen-Jen'' me.

178
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,591
You were supposed
to be my friend,..

179
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,274
..and now you're nothing
but a porn star.

180
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,757
Now l know why you wanted me
to lighten my hair. That's it.

181
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,068
Get out of here!

182
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,474
Oh!
l have to pick up my kids.

183
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,435
Jennifer,..

184
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,518
..you have to take your share
of responsibility for this.

185
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,717
- My share?! - Yeah. do you have
any idea how lonely l've been..

186
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,553
..while you've been off
doing this book club thing?

187
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,108
You are just
about to get lonelier.

188
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,429
Oh, man!

189
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,995
You creep.

190
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,237
You're not coming back here
in my house since it's my house.

191
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,594
There's nothing you can do
about it, Kip!

192
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,035
And you are not gonna
disrespect me!

193
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,476
Jesus!

194
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,555
Ma'am, please.

195
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,518
lf you don't mind?

196
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,077
Hello.

197
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,116
- You're hurt?
- Yes, ma'am, l am.

198
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,430
You're bleeding.
Rather profusely.

199
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,556
- That's what happens
when you get shot. - Shot!

200
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,835
- Yes, ma'am. - You've been shot?
- Definitely. But it's not..

201
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,558
..as bad as it looks. Really.

202
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,552
Well, you're at the wrong house.
lt's the wrong neighborhood.

203
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,279
- You want Queens. Maybe Brooklyn.
- Uh! No, wait.

204
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,869
l'm at the right house, Jennifer.
May l?

205
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,559
- l know you, don't l?
- Yes, ma'am, you do.

206
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,879
l'm so sorry. l can't
remember your name.

207
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,993
Frankie.
Frankie Delano.

208
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,599
Oh, right! Frankie.

209
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,793
You used to deliver groceries
for Angelo when l was a girl.

210
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,314
Yes, ma'am.
When you were a kid, ma'am.

211
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,316
The news
l heard you presumed.

212
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,476
Come again?

213
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,518
l presume
you heard the news.

214
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,349
- What news?
- Got a television?

215
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,909
Sources close to the investigation
tell Mobile Eight's news team..

216
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,879
..that it had the trademark signs
of a mob hit. - That nice old man?

217
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,151
We've gotta
get you to a hospital.

218
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,031
lt's,..

219
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,079
..not necessary.

220
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,556
The police?

221
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,352
Definitely not necessary.

222
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,354
Well, so what do we do?
You were shot!

223
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,312
That's what you said, right?

224
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,832
Ma'am, do you happen
to have..

225
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,031
..a DVD player?
- DVD?

226
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,756
Yes, ma'am, a DVD player.

227
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,949
- lt's been shot. - Shot?
- Yeah.

228
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,873
DVD's been shot. A lot
of that goin' around tonight.

229
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,791
There's another one
in the master bedroom, l think.

230
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,593
l'm a little drunk and goofy
from the loss of blood,..

231
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,114
..so if l happen to say
something outta line,..

232
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,078
..l'd like to apologize
ahead of time. You can put..

233
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,151
..the towels over there.
- Yes.

234
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,559
Great breasts. Absolutely great.
They're like champagne glasses.

235
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,955
- Apology accepted.
- l'm sorry.

236
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,279
Could you please play this?

237
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,393
You're not gonna do what
l think you're gonna do, are you?

238
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,152
lt's okay. lt's no big deal.

239
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,476
- l've done it before.
- Okay.

240
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,269
Ow! Ow!

241
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,630
Shh!

242
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,031
Oh, smart son of a....

243
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,870
lt's okay.

244
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,198
- Just two more.
- Yeah?

245
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,831
My dear Jennifer.

246
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,035
Did he just say
''Dear Jennifer''?

247
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,554
Could you pass me
the whiskey, please?

248
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,517
lf you're watchin' this,..

249
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,754
..l am dead.

250
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,513
How does he know who l am?

251
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,433
- Why is he telling me this?
- l'm telling you this..

252
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,518
..because you are not
who you think you are.

253
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,352
Well, right now,
that's a relief.

254
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,919
There was a war..

255
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:24,996
..in New York.

256
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,750
He had a lot of enemies at the time.
They were tryin' to take him out.

257
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,798
There was Sammy Carboni
who wanted to kill him.

258
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,475
And the same with Lucio Malatesta,
but as much as they both wanted..

259
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,870
..to get Angelo, they wanted
to kill each other even more.

260
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,991
So Malatesta gave Sammy
a new set of golf clubs.

261
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,597
lt was his way of making sure
the hit man would know just..

262
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,318
..where to find Sammy.

263
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,113
And since this hit man was
a traitor who worked for us,..

264
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,237
..it looked like Angelo
was behind Sammy's death.

265
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,958
And when the hit man
got taken out by Bruno senior..

266
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,714
..who was there left to tell
what really happened..

267
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,475
..with our guy laying dead there
with a smoking gun in his hand.

268
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,233
Wow.
What a hit.

269
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,796
But what kind of hit man,
of any substance, has his kid,..

270
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,555
..Bruno junior, waitin' in the car
when he does the thing?

271
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,273
ln the hospital,..

272
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,874
..Sammy Carboni's first visitor..

273
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,836
..was, of course, Lucio.

274
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,352
Lucio Malatesta,
who's blamed it all on me.

275
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,553
l come to tell you
that the guy who shot you..

276
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,631
..was one of Angelo's men.

277
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:46,958
Lucio. My son, little Gianni.
l ain't gonna be around..

278
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,549
..to watch him grow into man.

279
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,995
lf Angelo..

280
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,114
..ever has a child,..

281
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,712
..find it. Kill it.

282
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,079
My wife, Maria,..

283
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,436
..was pregnant,
so we flew to Sicily..

284
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,359
..to the village of Castellammare.

285
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,998
What more could l want?

286
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,393
My beloved wife,..

287
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,631
..her child on the way.

288
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,358
The opera house that l was..

289
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:27,429
..renovating to hear the music
that my wife Maria loved.

290
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:38,833
My wife died in childbirth.

291
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,351
l do not have the words..

292
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,715
..for my grief to this very day.

293
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,751
This is just the saddest.

294
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,274
His young wife dies giving
childbirth? lt's just.... Oh!

295
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,590
- They had a daughter.
- A daughter?

296
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,558
And when he came to America,
he brought his daughter,..

297
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,837
..but he had enemies over here.
And if they'd ever found him,..

298
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,480
..they woulda killed the baby.
- Oh, that's awful.

299
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,791
So he found this childless couple
that didn't have much money,..

300
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,431
..and he gave the husband a job,
and he bought them a big estate..

301
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,955
..in Glen Cove.

302
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,278
Well, that's where l lived.

303
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,839
And even though she had dark hair,
and they had blonde hair,..

304
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,756
..he still let them adopt her.
- He gave her away.

305
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,873
Ah, is it getting warm in here?

306
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:54,155
So he took care of all
their expenses under one condition.

307
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:00,398
That the girl never know
who her father was..

308
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:06,238
..because if she were to know....
- She'd go looking for him.

309
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,756
....and his enemies
would get to her.

310
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,115
So her parents never told her.

311
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,070
But now..

312
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,430
..it's time she knows.
- Oh, Jesus.

313
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,115
- Now it's time for you to know.
- Don't go there.

314
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,760
- l....
- Don't go there. No.

315
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,551
....am your father, Jennifer.

316
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,070
You..

317
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,469
..are an Allieghieri and we..

318
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,076
..do not bow down!

319
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,959
Night, Jennifer.

320
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,355
Who is it?

321
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,629
l've got a gun!

322
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:17,836
Somewhere.

323
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,348
- lt's only me, ma'am.
- Only you?

324
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,796
Good mornin'.
Let me get this.

325
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,430
Please don't close the door.
l never have any door closed.

326
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,188
Claustrophobic?

327
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,995
My phobias are none
of your business.

328
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,713
l'm calling the police.

329
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,792
Please, please, please.
You don't need to do that.

330
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,513
Are you gonna hurt me?

331
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:45,997
No.

332
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,439
Look what l got here.
ltalian eggs a la Milanese,..

333
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,114
..a little polenta, a little
biscotti, a little ricotta..

334
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,078
..and a lot of espresso.
- l don't eat that stuff.

335
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,636
l know. You have black coffee,
dry toast, no butter.

336
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,509
- Jam once a week.
- How do you know that?

337
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,192
Please,
it's gonna get cold.

338
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,429
- Are you all right? - Yes.
Thank you for asking. Very good.

339
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,352
Please.

340
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,670
Big house.

341
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,277
ls that your way of asking me
why there's no one here?

342
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,397
No, no.

343
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,871
Well, my son's off at military
school, if you can believe it.

344
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,790
At seven.

345
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,752
My husband's idea.
Well, my husband's away.

346
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,874
That's my idea.

347
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,832
- You really like cooking?
- No, l love cooking.

348
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,718
You ought to try the polenta.
lt's great for gaining weight.

349
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,518
See, your father always
wanted you to eat more.

350
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,795
- My father?
- You know, Angelo.

351
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,230
That's it.

352
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,319
Enough already, Frankie,
with the father and all the..

353
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,756
..whatever your name is. He
is not my father. Do you understand?

354
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,317
l..

355
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,032
..have a real-life father
who lives five miles from here.

356
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:08,871
Wait!

357
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,517
Stop!

358
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,229
- Could you just wait a minute?
- Stop!

359
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,993
l'm not gonna stop you,
but slow down for a minute!

360
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,753
l just wanna talk to you
for a second. Ma'am.

361
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,352
Look, if you need
someone to drive you....

362
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,510
Last night did not happen.
All right?

363
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,909
So when l come back,
you will be long gone.

364
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,992
Thank you for breakfast.
lt was lovely meeting you.

365
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,632
Where are you going?

366
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,993
Where are you going?

367
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,189
Therapy!

368
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,032
Come on.
You don't need therapy.

369
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:44,950
Oh, yeah.

370
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:47,870
Shopping.

371
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,639
Are you okay?

372
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,549
May l help you?

373
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,274
- And your name would be?
- Allison. Enchanting.

374
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,477
Allison, may l see everything
you have in Ensada in a size 7?

375
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:26,389
- Everything? - l wanna melt
this mother to the ground.

376
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,229
Cassidy, we have a no-limit on our
hands. l'm going to need backup.

377
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,439
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
l'll take them all.

378
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,469
My God!
Oh, my God!

379
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,949
lt's all right.
lt's all over. All over.

380
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,349
Oh, God! Oh, God! A hit?
That's what that was, right? A hit?

381
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,079
- Yes, ma'am, it was. - Oh, God!
Who would want to kill me?

382
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,469
l'd say Lucio Malatesta
would be at the top of my list.

383
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,073
List? What list?

384
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,234
People are lining up
wanting to kill me? What am l?

385
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,629
A Thanksgiving turkey
and people are placing orders?

386
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,314
- Let me drive this car, ma'am.
- No, l will drive my own car.

387
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,276
l know it's yours,..

388
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,999
..but l think l'm in a little
better mood than you are.

389
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,957
- l am perfectly capable of driving.
- l know you are.

390
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,474
You're probably a very good driver,
but l think now l'm the one..

391
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,630
..who should be driving the car.

392
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,353
Maybe it's my fault, ma'am.

393
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,476
Maybe they followed me
and l led 'em to you.

394
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,393
Great! Just great. Until l met you,
l was perfectly capable..

395
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,233
..of shopping for shoes
without someone trying to kill me!

396
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,795
What is that cologne
you're wearing?!

397
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,398
ls it Brut?
Oh, don't tell me it's Brut!

398
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:29,195
You know, ma'am, could we be just
quiet for a coupla seconds, please?

399
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,555
- Well, l am on edge, you know!
- Well, l understand,..

400
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,073
..but l'm really gettin'
a terrible headache.

401
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,879
Oh, pardon me all over the place.
Five seconds ago..

402
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,315
..l almost didn't even have a head!

403
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,350
And what's with this?
This?! Don't shrug! Speak!

404
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,671
Ma'am, what you're doing is you're
having this panic attack syndrome..

405
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,274
..and that often happens
after a hit. Really.

406
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,193
You know all about those things,
you're a hit man, right?

407
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,590
ls that what you are? No,
actually, a hit man takes a life.

408
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,473
l'm a bodyguard,
and a bodyguard protects it.

409
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,393
So you were my father's
bodyguard, and he got waxed.

410
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,155
And so now you're my bodyguard?
Thatjust fills me with confidence.

411
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,073
Boy, am l getting
a major league friggin' migraine!

412
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,799
Do you have any idea
how powerful my father is?

413
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,996
He is a very successful
New York businessman..

414
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,230
..who will make your life
a living hell!

415
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,469
lt's gettin' there.

416
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,039
Ma'am please, l'm sorry.
You don't have to do that.

417
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,952
l want to see my father, now.

418
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:24,350
- Your father was Angelo.
- Take me to my father's house now!

419
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,750
Mother?

420
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,669
ln here, dear.

421
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,189
My God, did you hear
what happened at the mall?

422
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,477
- There was a shootout! Just
think of it! - l have. Really.

423
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,115
l need to talk to you
and daddy immediately.

424
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,749
l think l just heard
your father return from his..

425
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,948
..racquetball lesson. - When did
daddy start playing racquetball?

426
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,313
Your father's having an affair.
At the club.

427
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,796
With the racquetball instructor.

428
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,274
How old is she?

429
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,512
Well, the she is a he.

430
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,071
Jen-Jen?
ls that you?

431
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,676
Daddy?

432
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,869
Jen-Jen!

433
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,593
Hello, loved one.

434
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,148
My, my.

435
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,550
Someone is looking fabulous!

436
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,679
Daddy,
don't take this in a bad way,..

437
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,717
..but have you switched..

438
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,030
..affiliations?
- Oh!

439
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,995
This doesn't change
anything between us.

440
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,957
After all,
l'm still your father.

441
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,680
l'm feeling better than ever,
thank you.

442
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,871
He's gotten me into great shape,
don't you think?

443
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,437
There is something completely
irrational about all men.

444
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,316
No kiddin'.

445
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,794
So what'd they say?

446
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,877
Exactly what l expected, thank you.
They say that they are indeed..

447
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,111
..my parents and that you,
Mr. Mafia Pants, are full of it.

448
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,158
So there. The emotional extortion
doesn't go past here.

449
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:23,199
- Furthermore, when my attorn --
- Excuse me. Tell me something, ma'am.

450
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,556
ls there a place where people go
to learn how to behave like this?

451
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,757
Talking all the time in a manner
designed to, like,..

452
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,629
..induce a migraine in a rock?
- l will not be talked to like this.

453
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,278
Don't you understand
this is not the real you?

454
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,351
- This is too, me.
- Really?

455
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,070
Do you know what is you?

456
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,711
Don't kill my parents!

457
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,957
They're not your parents.

458
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,276
Please, promise me
you won't wax them.

459
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,716
For the record,
it's not wax.

460
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,713
lt's whack.

461
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,433
How you doin', Whitney?

462
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,557
- Very well, Frankie. And you?
- Been better.

463
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,234
Yeah, l hear.

464
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,160
You look good, Whitney.
Are you takin' care of yourself?

465
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,356
You always did notice
the details, Frankie.

466
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,077
Wait.

467
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,278
You two weren't lovers.

468
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,517
Whitney,..

469
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,079
..it's time. Come on.

470
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,031
Do it.

471
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,832
Come on. Come on.

472
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,313
Simply put,
when Angelo brought you to us,..

473
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,314
..you were
the most beautiful baby girl.

474
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,148
You took my finger
and sat right on my lap.

475
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,034
You kept saying
the only word you knew.

476
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:11,117
''Pretty''.
''Pretty'' over and over.

477
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,319
Of course we took you.

478
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,431
We would've taken you without
the money, although the money..

479
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,795
..has been endlessly spectacular.

480
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:27,397
l've really given you nothing,
Jen-Jen. Nothing except my old,..

481
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,438
..ridiculous heart.

482
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,430
Daddy.

483
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,360
Mom, the food's better
than what we have at home.

484
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,110
Well, l guess it's better
than my cooking, right?

485
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,316
l never really
was too much of a cook.

486
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,516
No! No.

487
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,111
That's good.
lt's great! Really, it is.

488
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,839
Yeah, but, you know, sweetheart,
what l really need to talk..

489
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,070
..to you about is, genetics.

490
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,237
You know, the way things get passed
down through families?

491
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,595
Like,
it seems your grandfather.

492
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,911
Well, at least, l still
think he's your grandfather.

493
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,110
Uh, no.

494
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,393
l guess what l'm tryin' to say,
darling, is..

495
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,551
..how are things in the showers?

496
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:26,595
Okay, the Frankie cooking show
brought to you by Beretta.

497
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,115
- Are you crazy?
- A little.

498
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,758
Nothing. Nothing, darling,
it's just some thunder.

499
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,638
Mom, l gotta go, okay?

500
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,796
Okay.
Bye, darling. l love you.

501
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,119
So how's your boy?

502
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,272
He couldn't be happier.
l couldn't be lonelier.

503
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,913
You wrecked my kitchen.

504
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,878
- Oh, l'm sorry about the bullet.
Really. - No, l mean this.

505
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,554
Oh, this. This is what happens
when you cook a lot.

506
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,311
Really?

507
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,917
- You know, l'm sure your kid
really misses you. - No.

508
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,429
He really doesn't.
l mean, why should he?

509
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,239
He's got a father
who treats him like a dog and..

510
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,158
..a mother who's never had
a clue what to do with her life.

511
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,399
So, tell me the truth.

512
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,516
Somebody else did all this,
right? You're just faking it.

513
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,551
No. No, no, no.

514
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,358
l love cooking,
and l'll tell you what.

515
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,193
Just promise me you'll eat it
before it gets cold.

516
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,597
Sure.

517
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,871
So Frankie,
what's your nickname?

518
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:37,471
You know, your nickname.
All you mob guys have one, right?

519
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,120
Like, Louie the Lump,
Charlie Fat Lips,..

520
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,032
..Frankie the Food Freak.

521
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,471
lt's just Frankie, ma'am.

522
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,755
- What's Frankie short for?
- l don't know. What's that..

523
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,149
..got to do with anything?
- l just want to know.

524
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,868
ls it Francis?

525
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,039
You know, you got more important
things to think about, ma'am.

526
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,758
lt is Francis, isn't it?

527
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,877
You've got a girl's name.
Thatjust explains everything.

528
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,155
See, you've probably been
overcompensating your whole life.

529
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,596
You know, some anxiety
transference syndrome to,..

530
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:08,715
..you know, the macho, non-verbal,
Sicilian mixed in with the Brut..

531
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,589
..to cover the Francis that lives
inside some inner self or something.

532
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,238
That'll be your new nickname.
St. Francis the Brut.

533
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,788
Don't take this the wrong way,
ma'am, but l think you're startin'..

534
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,757
..to give me a small hole
in the side of my brain.

535
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,034
l will make you a deal.

536
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,997
lf you promise
to stop calling me ''ma'am'',..

537
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,479
..l'll stop calling you Francis.

538
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,279
And you swear to God
that you made all this?

539
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:29,752
Yes.

540
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,475
l didn't even know
l had any of this stuff.

541
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,358
You got a lot more
than you think you have.

542
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,270
Thank you.

543
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:44,950
Now what?

544
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,993
Look. Your father's dead
because l didn't do my job,..

545
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,514
..and it's not gonna
happen again. No way.

546
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,069
And l see you got
a guest house out there.

547
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,276
lf you don't mind,
l'd like to move in..

548
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,032
..'cause l don't trust anybody.

549
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,072
There is danger everywhere.
Everywhere l look.

550
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,436
The night has a thousand eyes.

551
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:04,995
Excuse me.

552
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,474
You stole that line.

553
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,916
l know. From Bobby Vee. Remember ''when
you tell those little white lies''?

554
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,594
''The night has a thousand eyes.''
Yes, l do.

555
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:20,239
That was playing when Peter Hackbart
was trying to get under my blouse.

556
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,795
l'm sorry.
l shouldn't have said that.

557
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,830
No.

558
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,271
What?

559
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,470
Actually, it wasn't your blouse.
lt was a bulky knit green sweater.

560
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,472
And what was playing was
Bon Jovi's biggest hit to date,..

561
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,839
..''You Give Love a Bad Name''.
- Jesus!

562
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,918
l'm goin' to bed.
Um...

563
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,353
You can stay
in the guest house, l guess.

564
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,358
- Thank you.
- lt's been a ridiculous day.

565
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,590
Ah!

566
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,913
Frankie!

567
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,273
What's going on?

568
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,996
l know this sack o' shit.

569
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,037
This sack of shit is my husband!

570
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,078
Sh! Now, you want me to take care
of this problem once and for all?

571
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,230
- Seriously? - Seriously.
Why don't you go back to bed..

572
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,392
..and let me do my job.
Do you have a shovel downstairs?

573
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,391
- A shovel? - Yes,
something l can dig a hole with.

574
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,435
Ah! Ah!

575
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:06,592
What the hell is going on?
Who the hell are you?

576
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:10,070
Who the hell is this?
Do you have a boyfriend already?

577
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,555
This is Frankie.
He's my bodyguard.

578
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,069
Look. Who are you
and what is that smell?

579
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,310
- lt's Brut.
- Well, it's overwhelming.

580
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,356
Ma'am, you don't have
to tell him anything.

581
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,479
Hey. You cannot talk to me
in my house like that.

582
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,953
lt's her house.

583
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,715
Reconsider.

584
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,196
Darling?

585
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,755
Darling,
l have to talk to you.

586
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:37,272
- Does he have to be here?
- He's just doing his job.

587
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,510
Whatjob?
l am your husband!

588
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,712
Do you mind? Please?

589
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:42,995
Sorry, Kipster.

590
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,874
Look, um, about yesterday.

591
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,554
That was simply an aberration,
fermented by the consumption..

592
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,678
..of too much single-malt scotch
on an empty stomach.

593
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:57,588
An aberration of marital ethics
for which l am truly,..

594
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,754
..truly grievous.
- Was it the only time?

595
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,039
Oh, absolutely!

596
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,231
August fourteenth,
the airport hotel.

597
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,069
Okay, okay.

598
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,955
Yeah, the Swedish flight attendant,
but that was the only other time.

599
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,671
December fifth, Four Seasons.

600
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,316
Ah, right.

601
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,830
Yeah, the real estate lady,
but she was a nooner!

602
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,316
My only nooner.
l swear to God!

603
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,679
Ah! Oh, Jesus Christ!

604
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,308
The fucking sky is falling!
All right, all right!

605
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,436
lt's been going on for years!

606
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,995
Get out!

607
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,874
You should go.

608
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,670
Then fine.

609
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,190
Great.

610
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,795
Terrific.

611
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,631
l'll see you in court.

612
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,639
- Well, there he goes.
- The past.

613
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,589
The future.

614
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:05,034
- Manless.
- Nah, there'll be other men.

615
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,678
l don't want other men.

616
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,712
l believe in two things.

617
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,788
The kindness of the saints
and there's somebody for everybody.

618
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,915
Do you have a someone, Frankie?

619
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,070
- Sort of.
- That's nice.

620
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,993
- Everyone should have someone.
- Mm-hm.

621
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,434
Why is everybody looking
like they hate me?

622
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,397
They think
you're Angelo's mistress.

623
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,711
Oh, Jesus! l feel
like a whore in a Catholic church!

624
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,115
Sh!
We all do.

625
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,234
What's he saying?

626
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,359
Mostly that we're not worthy.
Now he's talkin' about Christ.

627
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,190
And his blood.
And the wounds.

628
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:15,434
And more blood. Now the guilt.
There's more blood.

629
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,075
More wounds.
More blood.

630
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,550
Now he's back to the wounds.

631
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,430
That guy over there
is Bruno Maranzella.

632
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:32,149
- Where? - That guy over there with
the head like an aircraft carrier.

633
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,390
And this Malatesta fellow,
where is he?

634
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,916
Right in front of him. The guy that
looks like he should be in a box.

635
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,798
Jesus!
And whoever said men age well?

636
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:43,957
Sorry.

637
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,516
Angelo Allieghieri
was a man of great passion.

638
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,194
How Verdi, Rossini
would fill his heart.

639
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,469
He was a man of great sadness.

640
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,473
He lost his wife,..

641
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,950
..his Maria, too soon.

642
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,553
He never had children
or grandchildren whose laughter..

643
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:15,800
..would lighten the burden of old age.
Peace was his sadness.

644
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,390
His emptiness.
To die alone.

645
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:26,630
And so, Angelo, we remember you
here today. All in all.

646
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,711
- Amen.
- Amen.

647
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,151
l'll remember you, Angelo.

648
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,279
''Remembering''
in ltalian means vendetta.

649
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,830
(You keep the distance.)

650
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,152
(Always a distance.)

651
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,035
You gumbas never quit, do you?

652
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:02,430
Frankie?
Frankie, what's that noise?

653
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,111
Just taking out the trash, ma'am.

654
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,797
Frankie, did you say something?

655
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,031
Nothing, ma'am.
l didn't say anything.

656
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,911
Malatesta,
you're using amateurs.

657
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:18,995
Frankie?

658
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,156
Frankie?

659
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,478
- Frankie?
- Yeah!

660
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,348
May l come in?

661
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,356
All right.

662
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,631
Frankie? lt's not exactly warm
out here, you know?

663
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,552
- You okay?
- Peachy.

664
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,239
Oh, God! Oh!

665
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:54,393
l feel like l'm in the Brut center
of the universe!

666
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,754
l'm sorry about that.

667
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,831
Frankie, l am so frightened.

668
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,515
- l'm here, ma'am.
- Yeah, of course.

669
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,877
- You know what's terrific about
being frightened like this? - No.

670
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,837
At least now l'm frightened
about something specific,..

671
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,514
..like being whacked, as opposed
to the non-specific variety,..

672
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,750
..which is what l usually feel.
That kind of dread,..

673
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,560
..that free-floating
whatnot and all. - Mm-hm.

674
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:16,437
Oh.

675
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:21,435
l remember as a little girl
being afraid. Very afraid.

676
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:25,150
Little bogeymen under the bed
and devils in the closet.

677
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,314
lsn't it amazing
how our innermost fears..

678
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,948
..turn into this Freudian whole --

679
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,072
Did you say something?

680
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,519
No. No.

681
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,474
Amazing Freudian nuances
of memory and consciousness.

682
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,111
When l was growing up,
they sent me to an analyst.

683
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,952
Everyone was going
to an analyst at the time.

684
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,837
He said,
Dr. Gilmore was his name,..

685
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,911
..he said it's not so much that,
well, never mind what he said,..

686
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,036
..l lied to him all the time
because l didn't want him..

687
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:57,759
..tellin' my parents
what was going on and....

688
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,037
Ma'am?

689
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,149
Frankie?

690
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,799
We got squirrels.

691
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,436
- Squirrels, Frankie?
- Yes, ma'am.

692
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,194
Big squirrels.
They tend to overeat..

693
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,717
..preparing for a difficult winter,
and sometimes they bloat.

694
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,109
And often
they get caught in the walls.

695
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:24,832
And to get out
of the walls,..

696
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,831
..they have to deflate.

697
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:31,512
And, thus, this is causing
the passage of windage.

698
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:32,792
Oh.

699
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:37,316
Oh. Poor things.

700
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,000
Yeah. Tough luck.
Tough luck.

701
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,159
- Frankie?
- Mm-hm.

702
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,635
Tell me the part again.
That part..

703
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,950
..of dreaming about the saints.

704
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,672
Well, there's a dream that..

705
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,752
..Sicilians that have never
been to Sicily have.

706
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,631
That they're on the coast,..

707
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,629
..on a cliff.

708
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:09,752
Above the water.
And they hear this music.

709
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,595
The sound of opera
coming from somewhere,..

710
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,877
..but they don't know where.

711
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,918
And they believe it's
the saints who are singing.

712
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:21,317
Arias of longing
for what they've never known.

713
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,037
And your father,
he always told your mother..

714
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:29,034
..the greatest love stories
were in the opera.

715
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,796
He loved her very much.

716
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:06,718
Dammi la mano..

717
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,759
..in pegno!

718
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:14,799
 Eccola! - Ohimé!
Cos'hai. Che gelo é questo mai?

719
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,915
[ Skipped item nr. 719 ]

720
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:26,838
No, no, ch'io non mi pento,
Vanne lontan da me!

721
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,430
Pentiti, scellerato!

722
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:35,196
 No, vecchio infatuato!
- Pentiti! - No!

723
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,476
 Pentiti!
- No!

724
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:42,317
 Si! - No!
- Si! - No!

725
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:47,069
No! No!

726
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:54,952
#Ah! Tempo piú non v'é!

727
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,674
l'll be right back.

728
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,435
Great. You made it.
Two dozen, right?

729
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:08,152
Do me a favor and hang out here
until the thing is over,..

730
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,390
..and you'll hear some applause.
You'll come up to the door,..

731
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,436
..and l'll signal you to come on in.

732
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,988
- And we'll surprise her.
- Thank you.

733
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:25,596
- Do you know what they're saying?
- Not really. No. l know he's dead.

734
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,796
- He's dead, yes?
- Completely dead.

735
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,232
- What is he saying?
- Well, he wants his daughter..

736
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:33,869
..to avenge him. He's saying:
''Avenge me, my little one''.

737
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,153
''My little one''?
Oh, God, l can't stand it.

738
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:38,755
What else?

739
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:42,391
''Give the man who gave you life
peace in death''.

740
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,312
La vendetta é tutto!

741
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:49,157
- La vendetta é....
- Tutto. - ....tutto.

742
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:53,470
lnteresting.

743
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:05,430
Marcello!

744
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,194
Can you believe it?
He threw me a rose!

745
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,677
- A white rose. - Yeah, it's nice,
but l always thought the red ones..

746
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,069
..were the special ones.
- Oh, no. You don't understand.

747
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,310
White is special.
lt's pure. Not like red ones.

748
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,391
Everybody gets red roses.

749
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,119
- So how'd you like the opera?
- Oh, more..

750
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,760
..than l could have imagined.
- Yeah, well, Angelo loved it.

751
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:49,152
My father, was he handsome
when he was young?

752
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:55,355
Yeah, very. And your mother, she'd
be able to walk across a room,..

753
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,034
..and everything would just stop.
And l remember that one time,..

754
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:00,634
..at this wedding,
she made me dance with her.

755
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,631
- Were you embarrassed?
- Course l was embarrassed.

756
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:06,315
l was just a kid, but, you know,
she was pregnant with you.

757
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,836
Actually, that means you were
the first person l ever danced with.

758
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:10,750
Mm, l guess.

759
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,512
l like that thought.

760
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:19,071
Frankie, tell me something.
Why haven't you ever been married?

761
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,913
- l'm just waitin'. - Are you
saying you've never been in love?

762
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,673
Love is like this temporary form
of insanity, isn't it?

763
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,591
And you've never been insane?

764
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,634
You're reading that.

765
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:45,157
This Marcello, he turns
everything into such a passion.

766
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,759
l can't put it down.

767
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,912
- Have you ever read him?
- l don't think l'd like the guy.

768
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,833
- Why not?
- Ah, he looks a little too smooth.

769
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,913
- What's wrong with smooth?
- l don't know.

770
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,319
l know guys like that,..

771
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:00,119
..struttin' around like roosters,
taking credit for the sunrise.

772
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:03,510
Sometimes l just think smooth
is not too appealing, that's all.

773
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,989
So you don't think
a man can be called beautiful.

774
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,992
l think there's a possible exception
for every rule in the book,..

775
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:12,231
..but personally, l've never stood
on a chair and, in a loud voice,..

776
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:15,471
..yelled: ''Hey, guy,
you're really kinda gorgeous''.

777
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:19,112
''Wanna go to Palm Springs
this weekend, or whatever?''. No.

778
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,316
You see, women are totally
different about this.

779
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:25,632
Women have been known, on occasion,
to go absolutely crazy over a guy.

780
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,074
l know. Believe me.

781
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:28,429
- You know?
- Mm-hm.

782
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:31,080
You know, the first time l saw it,
it was when Sammy Carboni's kid..

783
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:34,072
..came back to Queens.
He was living over in ltaly,..

784
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,515
..and Angelo wanted to know
what he was like, so he had me..

785
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:40,115
..follow him. And one day,
l see all these little girls..

786
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:43,715
..goin' absolutely cuckoo nuts over
some kid. lt was like this kid..

787
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,678
..was a golden boy that the sun
was shining on all the time.

788
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:50,548
He's the kind of kid that every
13-year-old kid wanted to be like.

789
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,716
l know.
So l was just watchin' this.

790
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,478
Why were you watching him?

791
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,233
Well, it was Carboni.
Gianni Carboni.

792
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:08,915
- Son of Sammy Carboni?
- Uh, yeah. Right, right.

793
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,309
The guy that Lucio Malatesta
murdered, and....

794
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,755
- Frankie!
- ....tried to blame Angelo.

795
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,514
l think he's coming over here.
What should l say?

796
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,628
How do l look? l mean,
if you were walking over here..

797
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,153
..looking at me,
what would you think?

798
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:26,312
- You wouldn't want to know.
- l do. - Wouldn't. - l would.

799
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,675
Frankie! l'm serious.
He's getting closer.

800
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,995
What would you
want me to look like?

801
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,194
What are you doing?

802
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,430
No, no.
Just trust me on this one.

803
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,113
So, what do you think?

804
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,515
What do l think?

805
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:14,953
- Are you together?
- Mm. Yes.

806
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:18,155
Uh-uh-uh-uh-l-no.
l mean-l mean, no.

807
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,271
- He's the....
- ....Security consultant.

808
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,152
You mean, the bodyguard.

809
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:26,792
l am not good at pretending.
We've been watching each other.

810
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:29,189
So forgive me if l cause offense
baring my heart in telling..

811
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:32,636
..the truth. You see, in my soul,
l stand naked before you.

812
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:37,038
Maybe he ought to go back and get
dressed so he doesn't catch a cold.

813
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:37,552
No!

814
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:40,514
He's justjoking.

815
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:44,039
- You are Jennifer Barrett, yes?
- Yes, l am.

816
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:47,237
l wanted to thank you for arranging
my reading at your club.

817
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:50,198
But you seemed,
how shall l say, distracted.

818
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:53,557
l'm such a great admirer of yours.
l've read all of your books..

819
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,791
..over and over and....
- Miss Barrett?

820
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,316
What? Jennifer.

821
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,911
Jennifer. May l call you?

822
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:06,950
Thank you.

823
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,316
l apologize
if l disturb you.

824
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,678
Oh, my God!

825
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,353
Can you believe it?

826
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:30,390
Frankie?

827
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,555
Did Angelo....

828
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,715
Did my father
really want to protect me?

829
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:41,998
Protect you? Your father used
to drive by here on summer nights..

830
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,709
..and watch you go
swimmin' in the moonlight.

831
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,871
Then he'd see you
up in the balcony..

832
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:50,270
..you know, combing your hair,
talking on the phone to this guy..

833
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,193
..and that and comin' home
from school and kickin' up..

834
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,959
..those leaves
in the dyin' light of fall,..

835
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:59,834
..and l saw these things, too,
l'm definitely talking too much.

836
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,036
And l was just living my life.

837
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:06,799
- And you were there.
The whole time. - Yes, ma'am.

838
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:11,554
- Spying on me.
- Spyin'?

839
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:14,877
No. l wouldn't say that.
You know, l was watchin',..

840
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:18,393
..and for your information,
l knew when to turn away.

841
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:21,074
Did you have anything
to do with Bobby Jordan?

842
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,035
Excuse me?

843
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:24,954
Bobby Jordan.

844
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:27,920
Bobby Jordan.
Bobby Jordan.

845
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:32,630
No. Um,
l can't recall a Bobby Jordan.

846
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,836
l went with him in high school.

847
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:38,030
He was cheating on me
the whole time.

848
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:41,078
And l was so crazy about him.
l swear l would have married him.

849
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,754
And, then,
he just got strange, one day.

850
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:47,032
No! No! No, Frankie!
No, Frankie! No!

851
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:49,312
He stopped talking to me.

852
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:52,040
Young guys can go through
this neurotic phase.

853
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,599
Well, it's notjust guys.

854
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,989
- Could l have some more anisette?
- Sure.

855
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,837
What about Polly Peters?
Do you remember her?

856
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,877
No. l've never heard of her.

857
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:07,395
- Polly Peters. No.
- Well, she was this mean,..

858
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,471
..nasty witch who started
spreading awful stories..

859
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:13,269
..about me sleeping around.
She was destroying my reputation.

860
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:16,796
We know the most fragile thing in
the world is a woman's reputation.

861
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,199
lt all stopped,..

862
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:21,512
..right after this terrible thing
happened to her car.

863
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:23,236
My car!

864
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:33,109
lt's like she just sort of upped
and moved to another school.

865
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,031
You know something, Francis?

866
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:40,874
We're becoming friends.
Did you realize that?

867
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,792
No, l didn't know that.

868
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:45,514
Well, like it or not, we are.

869
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,599
Do you realize that you never
call me Jennifer?

870
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:52,394
You may, you know.

871
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,756
That being my name and all.

872
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,393
Good night, Francis.

873
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,512
Good night, Jennifer.

874
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:15,796
What?

875
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:17,435
Frankie!

876
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:22,158
Oh, my God!
The door's closed.

877
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,309
The door's closed.

878
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,311
Okay. Okay. Okay.
l'm gonna go up there.

879
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:28,839
- What are you gonna do?
- Just stay here.

880
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:32,230
No, l'm serious. You go somewhere.
l'll be all right. Stay here.

881
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:35,312
- Stay here. - No! - No!
- Yes. - No. - Yes. - No!

882
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:38,191
No!

883
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:59,710
l know this guy. He used
to work for Malatesta..

884
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,791
..before the Stroons
moved to Chicago.

885
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:04,713
We better move this Stroon because
l got neighbors all over the place.

886
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,711
God, l get so aggravated!

887
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:08,956
- Aggravated?
- Aggravated! Yes!

888
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,679
- Answer it.
- No!

889
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:12,790
- Yes!
- No!

890
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:14,755
Don't hit me.

891
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:16,510
Hold this.

892
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:20,752
Oh, Rawley, honey,
l miss you so.

893
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,438
- Mom?
- Yes, baby?

894
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,836
Make sure you call me tomorrow.

895
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,159
You know l will.
l love you, too.

896
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,678
All right. Bye baby.

897
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:38,510
l can't effing believe it.

898
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,754
My son actually calls me 5 minutes
after one of Malatesta's goons..

899
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:46,032
..tries to wax me!
What if they succeed next time?

900
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:48,953
Where does that leave Rawley? l'll
tell you where that leaves Rawley.

901
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:52,157
lt leaves him
without a mother. Oh, God!

902
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:56,074
My son is not going
to be an orphan!

903
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:09,879
- l made a decision, Frankie.
- Yeah, what's that?

904
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,911
l have to whack Malatesta.

905
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,470
You're gonna whack Malatesta?

906
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:19,638
Frankie, my ''willow
in the wind'' days are over.

907
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:23,590
You're getting in your-way
over your head on this one, really.

908
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:26,029
An Allieghieri does not bow down.

909
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,436
l'm sorry,
l ever told you that.

910
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,876
You're gonna whack Malatesta.
That's just great.

911
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,149
- Nice moon.
- lt's beautiful.

912
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:06,559
Just beautiful.

913
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:26,080
So you think you got this vengeance
thing all figured out.

914
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:28,390
- You know how it's done?
- Done?

915
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,077
- Oh, you mean the thing?
- Yeah.

916
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:34,159
- Not really.
- lt's not as easy as it looks.

917
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:38,350
There's all kinds of courage,
you know?

918
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:40,630
l know.

919
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:44,513
A woman's courage should
never be underestimated.

920
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:46,957
Ever be underestimated.

921
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:48,351
Ever.

922
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,513
Let's go over it again.

923
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:52,990
- Go over what?
- The plan.

924
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:56,831
We go to the Valhalla lnn.

925
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:59,956
You wait in the parking lot.
l walk in.

926
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:01,632
Malatesta takes
a good look at me.

927
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:05,838
He thinks he could have any woman
because he's a little tweaked.

928
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,274
l bat my eyes.

929
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:11,838
And then l whack him.

930
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:13,791
And you think you can do this.

931
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:15,916
Oh, l think l can do this.

932
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,950
Okay. Show me.

933
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:21,152
- What?
- Your walk. - Why?

934
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:23,310
'Cause you go in that place
and your walk doesn't match..

935
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:25,675
..your attitude, and your attitude
doesn't match your walk,..

936
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:28,638
..you're gonna be in a bag
and the bag's gonna be in the river.

937
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:29,630
Really?

938
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:31,710
Watch this.

939
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:37,590
That is nothing short of terrible.

940
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,512
Are you telling me
how to walk now?

941
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:42,319
- Well, somebody's got to.
- Well, you think you can do it?

942
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:43,911
Maybe.

943
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:47,428
Are you gonna
put me on the spot? Okay.

944
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,238
What am l doin'?
Forget about it.

945
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:54,118
- Come on, Jennifer, this is yourjob.
- Concentrate. You said you could.

946
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:58,113
- Enlighten me a bit. - Come on.
You can do it! One, two, one....

947
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,474
That's it.

948
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,676
Nah, do you have an ankle damage?

949
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:04,716
Now you're really starting
to irritate me, and l can't....

950
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:07,268
Just follow me. Just follow me.
l can figure this out. Ready?

951
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:09,715
Let's go.
One, two. Cross over.

952
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:12,310
Like an antelope?
Back and forth.

953
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:09,713
l don't think this is right.
You goin' in there alone.

954
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,870
- l'll be fine. - Well,
l don't know about that,..

955
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:13,439
..because l think it's better
if l go in there..

956
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,238
..and maybe hang out in the back
in case there's any trouble.

957
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:17,356
Frankie, no.
lf this is my life now,..

958
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,829
..l've got to learn to handle
something on my own.

959
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,672
You can't keep bailing me out.

960
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:24,156
All right.

961
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:28,917
He'll be at the corner table,
probably on the phone,..

962
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:31,275
..whacking somebody long distance.

963
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:34,915
Thank you.

964
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:48,478
Jennifer?
The ring. The ring.

965
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:58,672
The boss says you need a rope.

966
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,279
Get her over here!

967
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:34,630
There's someone at my table
that would really like to meet you.

968
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:37,154
Maybe that someone should've
had the manners to come over here..

969
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:40,038
..and introduce himself.
- Don't be a fuckin' idiot.

970
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:42,919
Simple. Direct.
l like that in a man.

971
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:55,039
- So, do l know you?
- She's Angelo's.

972
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:57,031
Was.

973
01:08:57,760 --> 01:09:00,035
So now you come over
to the A-team.

974
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:03,317
You don't exactly look bereft
with grief and, uh..

975
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:04,390
..whatnot.

976
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:06,109
He was old.

977
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:08,589
What am l? Springtime?

978
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:11,998
- Maybe you're different.
- Maybe. Maybe.

979
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,959
Where the hell
do you think you're goin'?

980
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:22,519
You're fantastic.

981
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:30,075
What's the matter with him?
What's goin' on?

982
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:32,515
- Goddamn ticker.
- Ticker?! Let me help.

983
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:35,234
Call the ambulance.
Get some help. Call a doctor.

984
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:36,918
Don't help so much.

985
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:50,270
You're an angel.
My good luck piece.

986
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:52,112
Maybe you shouldn't talk.
Rest.

987
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:55,232
Bruno, shut up.
She comes with me.

988
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:11,158
l keep telling you
l don't need this shit!

989
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:12,669
Just fine.

990
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:17,357
- You'll see.
- l'll see?

991
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:20,073
Get me a priest.

992
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:22,515
Tell your guy to stop
so we can get ourselves a priest.

993
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:25,273
- What do you need a priest for?
- You. Sit there and fix your hair.

994
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:26,634
All right? Now, relax.

995
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:28,915
He'll be fine.
Your big night's coming.

996
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:34,670
Hail, Mary, full of grace....
ls anyone there? Anyone?

997
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:39,870
Could you please get these goons
off my back? Please? Amen. Amen.

998
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:47,628
This is for last rites,
l presume.

999
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:50,880
Hey, Father, relax.
lt's Lucio's little fantasy.

1000
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:54,032
He likes pretendin'
that he's married to all his bimbos.

1001
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:54,956
Jennifer.

1002
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:57,635
Jennifer!

1003
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:02,549
My heart ain't no fine-tuned watch.
But what the hell?

1004
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:05,392
l wanna go out special.

1005
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,638
Like, married to you.

1006
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:09,794
But l am married.

1007
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:12,633
- Don't go gettin' technical.
- But l'm married!

1008
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,916
No. Questo no....
The Church cannot all --

1009
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,309
So, Father, you're gonna pull
some strings right?

1010
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:20,949
The Church cannot allow
such a love so pure to go --

1011
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:23,355
l'm an old man with a couple
of months to live.

1012
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:26,273
Here's a young broad on the make,
so what the hell?

1013
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:30,990
Love, like all things fine and true,
takes time to blossom and bloom.

1014
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:34,237
Blow me with the blossoming
and the blooming. Do it.

1015
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:36,715
You are man and wife.
Kiss the bride.

1016
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:38,515
You heard him.

1017
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:55,196
Everything's all right.
l got the doctor in one room..

1018
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:56,952
..and the broad in the other.
All right?

1019
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:58,632
Be careful with him!

1020
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:09,279
And what the hell is this?

1021
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,316
lt's your wedding trousseau.
Put it on.

1022
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:18,317
Move!

1023
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:20,996
Thank you!

1024
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,038
Fucking dog.
All he does is bark.

1025
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:28,390
Dog's been barkin'
all night long.

1026
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:35,314
Where's my bride?

1027
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:39,077
Oh!

1028
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:43,559
Would you shut up?

1029
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,877
All you do is sit around
and bark. You're useless!

1030
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:54,037
Too bad, huh? Keith, do me a favor.
While this retard reshuffles,..

1031
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:55,951
..will you go check
on the old man for me? Thank you.

1032
01:12:56,040 --> 01:13:00,113
What do you call me a retard for?
What'd l do to you? l just play cards.

1033
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,072
Spell ''ecclesiastical''.

1034
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:04,351
- Ex-scles.... l....
- Retarded.

1035
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:10,235
''Ex-sclesiastical''.
What is that? Ex-sclesiastical.

1036
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:16,191
Where are you, my beloved?

1037
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:20,030
There's only me out here now.

1038
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:31,274
Look at you.
Like an angel, you are.

1039
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:36,553
And look at me, like some
dried-up prune creature.

1040
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:38,316
Oh,..

1041
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:39,869
..mi amore.

1042
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:50,234
But tonight
l'm coming back from the dead,..

1043
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:53,790
..like some mighty oak
rising out of some dead jungle.

1044
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:57,752
But, angel-face, we must go slow.

1045
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:01,070
Very slow. You know?

1046
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:05,508
Like molten lava.

1047
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:11,836
There's a few more tunes
to be played on this flute.

1048
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:15,120
But you must be
careful of the ticker.

1049
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:19,996
Time
to mount the baloney pony.

1050
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:29,793
Ah! Ah!

1051
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:31,956
Ah!

1052
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:48,472
Thanks a lot for that last one.
Let's play ''Chase the Bitch''.

1053
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:49,879
No, we're playin'
a different game.

1054
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:51,518
l know how
to play ''Chase the Bitch''.

1055
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,830
ls your mother in this game?
l didn't notice.

1056
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:56,036
- l got four hundred on this.
- What are you gonna do?

1057
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:01,079
Hey! The broad!
Get-get off your ass!

1058
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:01,911
Let's go!

1059
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,117
Let's go!
Come on! Let's go!

1060
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:12,636
Ah, shit!

1061
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:33,512
Stupid mutt!
lt's payback time!

1062
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:39,996
- Jennifer!
- Frankie? - Come on!

1063
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:43,150
Oh, God!

1064
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,391
- l did it!
- Did what? - l did it!

1065
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:54,550
- What'd you do?
- l whacked Malatesta!

1066
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:56,392
- You did? No, you didn't.
- l did, too.

1067
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:57,959
- Oh, come on. You didn't.
- Oh, l did, too.

1068
01:15:58,040 --> 01:15:59,996
- He looked pretty dead.
- Really? How?

1069
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:01,991
- You wanna know how?
- Look, l wasn't there.

1070
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:04,799
- l'm askin' how.
- l married him to death.

1071
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:10,238
- That'll do it.
- Yeah.

1072
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:12,830
Cheers.

1073
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:23,637
lf l don't have
any more enemies, does that....

1074
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:28,313
Does that mean
that you won't be around?

1075
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:32,357
- Surely l must still be in....
- ....grave danger? - Yes.

1076
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:35,717
Yeah, there's still
a few bad guys hangin' around.

1077
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,836
- l think it's Rawley.
- l'll get it.

1078
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:44,234
He misses me.

1079
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:53,519
Hello? Oh!

1080
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:59,473
Oh, Marcello, l forgot.
Um, no, it's not too late.

1081
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:00,430
lt's not.

1082
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:07,794
Yes, tomorrow would be all right.
Mm-hm.

1083
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:02,832
How you doin', Bruno?

1084
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:05,554
Wanna know what the old man's
last words were?

1085
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:07,073
''Try the clams''.

1086
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:11,313
''They're fabulous''.
You got any last words?

1087
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:16,911
- You ever read this book?
- Have l read that book?

1088
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:19,310
Not only does that insult
my intelligence,..

1089
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:22,392
..it insults my ignorance.
Why would a man like me,..

1090
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:25,593
..who happens to like himself,
be caught dead reading..

1091
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:28,911
..a bit of boy-toy fluff like that?
- 'Cause it's a killer.

1092
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,675
You have a lot of anger
in you, Bruno.

1093
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:01,954
You've been working.

1094
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:04,270
Yeah,
a little home improvement.

1095
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,871
You got stuff here.

1096
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:11,272
He got to you, didn't he?

1097
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:32,349
You okay?

1098
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:35,033
lt was just drinks.

1099
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:38,595
lt's none of my business.
l wasn't asking that.

1100
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:40,955
No, but l know you.

1101
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:43,909
You know me.

1102
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:48,273
Marcello asked me to go
to Sicily with him.

1103
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:51,078
So, l guess you're....

1104
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:52,870
Going.

1105
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:55,436
Course.

1106
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:58,636
lt's no big deal or anything.

1107
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:02,351
What are you afraid of?

1108
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,437
Telling me something
l want to hear?

1109
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:09,159
Telling me that l'm more
than just some obligation?

1110
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:11,470
Maybe l mean something to you?

1111
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:56,435
l ran away and never returned.

1112
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:01,192
From then on, l became a kind
of legend, surrounded by a mystery,..

1113
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:05,876
..fed on itself. Some people
thought l ran drugs. And others..

1114
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:10,113
..suspected l became a killer. None
of that came close to explaining..

1115
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:13,829
..what happened. See, l'm talking
about the kind of pain..

1116
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,639
..that eats away at you
and it never leaves.

1117
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,799
l want you to know it.

1118
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:23,158
l want you to feel it.

1119
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,112
(Watch out for the one..)

1120
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:27,959
(..who feels pain..)

1121
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,831
(..and wants you to know it.)

1122
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:34,076
Check!

1123
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:00,714
This is my mother.

1124
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:06,599
We're in the opera house.

1125
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:09,830
Happy?

1126
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:14,595
Marcello,..

1127
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:17,957
..l have to tell you something.

1128
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:22,358
Uh, l'm not who l say l am.
My name is not really..

1129
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:25,870
..Jennifer Barrett.
l'm an Allieghieri.

1130
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:30,396
My father was a man named
Angelo Allieghieri, and he....

1131
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:32,190
l know.

1132
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:36,236
You know?

1133
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:40,151
And do you want
to know who l am?

1134
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,871
l know who you are, Marcello.

1135
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,594
You have no fucking idea
who l am.

1136
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:48,356
What?

1137
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:50,875
Your father,
he killed my father.

1138
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:53,790
- U-uh, Marcello....
- Call me Gianni.

1139
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:55,075
Sammy's son.

1140
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:57,510
- Sammy who?
- Sammy Carboni.

1141
01:24:58,120 --> 01:25:00,680
Angelo murdered him,
standing there unarmed,..

1142
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:03,832
..with only a golf club
in his hands. Such a coward.

1143
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,992
- No. You're making a mistake.
lt was Lu --. - Enough!

1144
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:11,157
What your father did, it lives
in me like it was yesterday.

1145
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:14,989
- That pain hidden away.
- Uh, Gianni, or Marcello....

1146
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:17,390
Marcello!
What a freaking stupid name!

1147
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:20,319
- l like that name.
- Those stupid books?

1148
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:24,235
l couldn't believe my luck.
But, then Bruno said you needed..

1149
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:26,749
..your little fantasies.
- Bruno?

1150
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:30,590
You killed my father
and not Malatesta?

1151
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:32,751
Jennifer, please, understand.

1152
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:36,313
- La vendetta é tutto.
- Vendetta?

1153
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:39,077
Oh, enough with all that!

1154
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:46,111
- Hey, Jennifer!
- Figlio di puttana.

1155
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:47,509
Parli italiano?

1156
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:50,234
l had a great teacher,
and right now l miss him.

1157
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:51,833
Of course. Frankie.

1158
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,513
Such a pain he was.

1159
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:56,280
lt hurt me to see you
so happy with him.

1160
01:25:56,360 --> 01:26:02,708
Jennifer, please understand. l must
do this. My ancestors demand of me.

1161
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:06,550
Brut?

1162
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:09,391
Oh!

1163
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:16,831
Frankie!

1164
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:35,232
God!

1165
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:40,310
- How bad is it?
- lt's all right.

1166
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:44,193
This is the theater.

1167
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:47,519
Angelo was right.
He said l'd be back some day.

1168
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:54,636
You know when l was a boy
with Angelo, l'd watch you.

1169
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:58,712
l would. On summer nights,
l'd watch you, and l'd memorize..

1170
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:03,999
..your face in the moonlight.
l fell in love with you then.

1171
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:07,590
And l guess l'm fallin' still.

1172
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:11,792
Frankie, l love you,
so don't you do anything dumb,..

1173
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:14,633
..like die on me right after
you made an admission like that.

1174
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:17,188
Because you shoulda made it
a long time ago!

1175
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:23,995
Fair enough.

1176
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:04,278
[You know, Angelo used to say
there's never perfect people,..]

1177
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:06,828
[..only perfect moments.
And, of course, he was right..]

1178
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:08,512
[..because l'm living one of them.]

1179
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:10,989
[Doin' something l love
in a place that l love..]

1180
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:13,436
[..with a new family that l love.]

1181
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:16,913
Go and get Frankie for me,
will you? Thank you, Rawley.

1182
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:22,274
Frankie! Frankie!
Mom says you gotta get pink!

1183
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:25,033
- We gotta go! Or else!
- Whoa!

1184
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:28,113
Su, Frankie. Andiamo.
Andiamo. É tardi.

1185
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:30,788
[Needless to say,
Jennifer has found her roots..]

1186
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:33,155
[..and is becoming
an authentic ltalian mother.]

1187
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:36,949
[And l'm enjoyin'
being around at all. And why not?]

1188
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:39,350
[lsn't living
better than watching?]

1189
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:45,752
[So, Angelo, if you're listening,
l have to apologize.]

1190
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:49,358
[l just couldn't
keep the distance anymore.]
