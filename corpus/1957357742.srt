590
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:33,700

you would say,

"The color of my shirt
is red."

592
00:35:36,052 --> 00:35:39,140
- Make sense?
- But my shirt is white.

593
00:35:39,142 --> 00:35:41,317
Yeah. So, then,
you would say,

00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:43,536
The color of my shirt
is white."

- Yeah.

decide to get into

renting out your house?

600
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:59,248
For starters,
this isn't really my house.

601
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:02,076
My father left it to me
when he died.

602
00:36:02,078 --> 00:36:05,819
He owned it with my stepmom,
and when he passed,

603
00:36:05,821 --> 00:36:07,908
she got his house
in South Carolina,

604
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:09,649
and I got this one.

605
00:36:09,651 --> 00:36:12,261
Oh, wow. I'm...

606
00:36:12,263 --> 00:36:14,045
so sorry to hear that.

607
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:15,742
But it must be nice
to have a place like this

608
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:17,004
to remember him by.

609
00:36:17,006 --> 00:36:19,006
Yeah, it's great.

610
00:36:19,008 --> 00:36:20,791

not far from here...

00:36:20,793 --> 00:36:22,619
much smaller...

612
00:36:22,621 --> 00:36:25,535
so I'm able to
keep an eye on it.

613
00:36:25,537 --> 00:36:28,842
But... it felt wrong
to keep it empty.

614
00:36:28,844 --> 00:36:32,150
So, when all of these

615
00:36:32,152 --> 00:36:35,675

that has stayed,

an entire month over Christmas.

I was living alone,

628

and all of their kids
had kids,

629
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:18,283
and did their own thing
for the holidays.

630
00:37:18,285 --> 00:37:20,503
So, they invited me in.

631
00:37:20,505 --> 00:37:22,940
And we spent
the holidays together.

00:37:22,942 --> 00:37:27,727
