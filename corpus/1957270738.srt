00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,166
Uh, London.

183
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,041
- London?
- Yes.

184
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,791
But my dad was from India.

185
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:07,750
What are you doing here?

186
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,125
[laughs softly]

187
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:12,708
Are you married?

188
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,375
[laughs softly] Nope.

189
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,083
How old are you?

190
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,208
[in English] Thirty four.

191
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,083
[in Hindi] And you're still not married?

192
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,166
[clicks tongue]

193
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,666
My friend has
a one-year-old daughter already.

194
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:30,458
How old are you?

195
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,833
Okay, what grade are you in?

196
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:39,708
Tell me.

197
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,541
I don't go to school anymore.

198
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:43,458
Why not?

199
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,750
I don't have a school uniform.

200
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:50,791
That’s it?

201
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,458
Because of a school uniform?

202
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,541
So what do you do then?

203
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:03,083
Housework, work in the fields
and in the market.

204
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,125
But it's important to go to school.

205
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:08,125
If you don't go to school,
what will you do in the future?

206
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,250
[wheels rolling]

207
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:11,916
[shouting playfully]

208
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:18,333
- [in English] Sorry, auntie.
- [Jessica] You little brat.

209
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:21,416
[in Hindi] Look at my hair and my shirt.

210
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,291
- [in Hindi] You can speak in Hindi?
- Yes.

211
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,000
What's this?

212
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,666
His bearing car.

213
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,291
Come, take a look.

214
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,833
This is my bearing car.

215
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:32,750
[Jessica laughs]

216
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,333
[in English]
Oh my God. Just like a skateboard.

217
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,333
- [in Hindi] Did you make it?
- Yes.

218
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:39,583
Skateboard?

219
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:44,333
You don't know what’s a skateboard?
Okay, give me a minute.

220
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,541
[in English] Ugh! No connection.

221
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,291
[in Hindi] Try it, come on.

222
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,375
- Come.
- Oh no.

223
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:54,000
- Come on.
- Try it, it will be fun.

224
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:55,458
Come.

225
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:56,541
[Jessica laughs]

226
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:57,500

228
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,815
- [Jessica] Now, you do it.
- [Ankush] See, it was fun, right?

229
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,541
[Ankush] Slow down.

230
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,666
Listen, where does one get new uniforms?

231
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:14,125
[Ankush laughing in video]

232
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,708
<i>See, it was fun, right?</i>

233
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:33,166
[mobile phone notifications dinging]

234
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,041
[in Hindi]
I thought she'd yell or even hit me.

235
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,208
- But she didn't.
- [mother chuckles]

236
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:02,833
She was very polite.

237
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,333
And then...

238
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,500
I don't know why.

239
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,083
...she spoke about herself.
Asked me what I do.

240
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:12,791
She’s very sweet.

241
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,208
She's a foreigner
but speaks Hindi really well.

242
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,791
- She also sprays perfume on her hands.
- [laughing]

243
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,583
But what is she doing here?

244
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:25,458
I don't know.

245
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:27,291
She doesn't know either.

246
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,166
- Where is she from?
- London.

247
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:34,583
London? Where's this village?

248
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,541
[Prerna sighs softly]

249
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,000
[clicks tongue] It's brand new.

250
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,375
And she didn't want anything in return?

251
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,500
There's got to be a reason.

252
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,375
[tuts] You're so silly,

253
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,166
taking stuff from strangers.

254
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,625
Don't let your father see this, hmm?

255
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,208
Go now.

256
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,333
Prerna.

257
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,333
The textbook.

258
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,583
- What are you studying?
- The map.

- Where did you get him from?
- He is...

266
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:36,375
Gillu.

267
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:39,083
You goat thief! Did you steal a goat?

268
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,583
Look, Ma, she stole a goat.

269
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:46,000
Ma, he was trapped over there.

270
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,708
I just saved his life.

271
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:50,541
That's good. Now leave him here.
It belongs to someone else.

272
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,166
He's a stray.

273
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,583
Can’t we take him home?

274
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:55,666
[mother] No way!

[soft instrumental music playing]

276
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:08,291
[Ankush] Do you know
what I prayed for in the temple?

277
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:09,916
[Prerna] What?

278
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:17,875
See this.

279
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:21,250
- Cool shoes, right?
- Keep dreaming.

280
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:23,875
What did you pray for?

281
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:29,166
Never mind. God can't hear you
from outside the temple.

282
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,250
Why didn't you come inside?

283
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:36,916
Stomach cramps.

284
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:38,916
Again?

285
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:41,625
Shut up, Ankush.

Why?

00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:15,750
No. I won't be able to do it.

359
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:18,625
Just try and step on the board once.

360
00:25:18,708 --> 00:25:21,083
No, <i>didi</i>, I'll fall.

361

- <i>Bhaiya</i>, please.
- <i>Bhaiya,</i> please.

391
00:27:25,791 --> 00:27:28,351
[in English] Do you wanna stay
and teach them some skateboarding?

392
00:27:28,416 --> 00:27:31,291
I'd love to,
but I'd have to get covered at the school.

393
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:34,000
Wait. Wait. Wait.
How... how long are <i>you </i>here for?

394
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:35,666
Did Sid fire you or something?

395
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,333
No. He let me have two weeks off.

396
00:27:37,416 --> 00:27:41,500
[in Hindi]
<i>Bhaiya</i>, I want to skate again. Please.

397
00:27:41,583 --> 00:27:44,166

another room for you. No issues.

00:27:44,666 --> 00:27:47,000
[in Hindi] <i>Bhaiya</i>, please stay back.

399
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:50,458

Prerna.

Do you know how to go online?

It's like the sea. [whooshes]

412
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:28,375
Hold on to this.

413
00:29:29,208 --> 00:29:31,333
You can practice and give it back.

414
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:34,361
[in Hindi] Can I keep it for now?

415

[in Hindi] Where did this come from?

419
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:44,416
Someone gave it to Ankush for a day.

420
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,041
I will return it tomorrow.

421
00:30:47,666 --> 00:30:49,875
Why are you playing
with things meant for boys?

422
00:30:49,958 --> 00:30:51,166
Go, cook some lentils.

423
00:30:52,791 --> 00:30:55,125
[laughing]

424
00:30:58,833 --> 00:30:59,833

<i>Didi!</i>

440
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:53,666
Who asked you to dive in?

441
00:31:54,583 --> 00:31:56,375
You’ve ruined Erick <i>Bhaiya's </i>board.

442
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:58,916
How will we explain this at home?

443
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:02,250
Had fun skating?

444
00:32:06,416 --> 00:32:07,416
Come, Gillu.

445
00:32:14,958 --> 00:32:16,625
[mother] What did I tell you earlier?

446
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,791
You took something from a stranger again?

[motorbike approaches, stops]

448
00:32:25,583 --> 00:32:29,791
[whispering] Go, hide it now. And listen,
you better return it first thing tomorrow.

449
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:31,916
Go quickly.

450
00:32:35,208 --> 00:32:37,625
Kamlesh has put me
on double shifts starting tomorrow.

00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:40,958
- [mother] Water?
- No.

[bills rustling]

453
00:33:04,541 --> 00:33:07,541
[Jessica, in English] It's so different
to London. It's so peaceful here.

454
00:33:07,625 --> 00:33:08,745
[Vikram, in Hindi] Get down.

455
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,210
[Erick, in English]
It's Miss Inspiration herself.

[Jessica] What... what's happened?
[in Hindi] What happened?

457
00:33:14,541 --> 00:33:15,375
Skateboard!

458

[in Hindi] What?

459
00:33:17,041 --> 00:33:18,625
How much does a skateboard cost?

460
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:23,375
She's ruined Erick <i>Bhaiya's</i> skateboard.
It's destroyed.

461
00:33:24,708 --> 00:33:25,708
Sorry, <i>bhaiya</i>.

How did you even do this?

465
00:33:35,375 --> 00:33:37,333
Oh man! [chuckles]

466
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:38,916
[Jessica] Um...

00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Sorry, <i>bhaiya</i>.

Did you go surfing, huh? [whooshes]

469

[Jessica laughs]

470
00:33:44,583 --> 00:33:45,625
[Prerna] <i>Bhaiya</i>!

- No.
- Please, <i>bhaiya</i>.

472
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:52,208
No. I don't need it. I don't want it.
This is... It's okay.

473
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:54,091
[Jessica, in Hindi]
Come on, now go to school.

474
00:33:57,291 --> 00:33:58,291
[Erick, in English] Hey.

475
00:33:58,958 --> 00:34:01,041
It's okay. I don't mind.

476
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:05,458
[Jessica] Oh no.

477
00:34:18,833 --> 00:34:20,791
[father, in Hindi]
Stealing in your own house?

478
00:34:24,083 --> 00:34:25,291
Is this what we’ve taught you?

479
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:28,166
No, Papa. I...

480
00:34:28,791 --> 00:34:30,125
I was putting it back.

481
00:34:30,791 --> 00:34:32,166
So, you did steal before?

482
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:37,625
I’m asking you something.

483
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:40,833
I made a mistake, Papa.

484
00:34:53,416 --> 00:34:54,416
<i>Didi.</i>

485
00:34:55,833 --> 00:34:57,666
Why did you put the money back?

486
00:34:58,708 --> 00:35:02,625
We could’ve bought chocolates with it.
We could’ve had so much fun.

487
00:35:06,458 --> 00:35:07,458
[in English] Sorry.

488
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,875
It's cool. I will finish that off.

489
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:27,166
- Hi, guys.
- [children] Hi, <i>didi</i>.

490
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,875
[Jessica] I have a small surprise.

491
00:35:33,458 --> 00:35:34,458
You didn't?

492
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:40,166
- No way.
- I couldn't resist.

493
00:35:41,083 --> 00:35:42,541
Want to see what's inside?

494
00:35:42,625 --> 00:35:43,666
[children, in Hindi] Yes!

495
00:35:45,916 --> 00:35:48,125
[Ankush]
This is a real bearing car, right?

496
00:35:48,208 --> 00:35:49,708
[children] Wow! Whoa!

497
00:35:49,791 --> 00:35:51,791
[children chattering]

498
00:35:56,083 --> 00:35:57,083
[Vikram] Subodh.

499
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:02,166
[in English] This one's for you.

500
00:36:04,916 --> 00:36:05,750
[in Hindi] No.

501
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:07,541
[in English] It's for you. Please.

502
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:09,541
- [in Hindi] For me?
- Yes.

503
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:11,375
[in English] Take it.

504
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:27,541
[Erick] No way.

505
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:31,351
- Yours got ruined. So, I just...
- [Erick] Thank you.

506
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:32,375
<i>Didi.</i>

507
00:36:34,416 --> 00:36:37,333
[in Hindi] Do you think
she will get us new shoes too?

508
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:40,250
No?

509
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:01,500
[in English] Perfect.

510
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:31,250
Thanks so much for sticking around.
Couldn't have done it without you.

511
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:33,708
You kidding?
You think I'd have missed this?

512
00:37:33,791 --> 00:37:35,041
This is huge.

513
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:37,458
I mean, this doesn't happen every day.

514
00:37:37,541 --> 00:37:39,958
You just gave these kids
their first board. [laughs softly]

515
00:37:40,666 --> 00:37:42,333
Do you remember your first board?

516
00:37:42,416 --> 00:37:43,708
[Erick] Yeah. I do.

517
00:37:43,791 --> 00:37:45,916
Um, I was eight years old,

518
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,541
and my mom bought it for me.

519
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:49,916
Pretty much saved my life.

520
00:37:50,666 --> 00:37:51,833
[Jessica] What do you mean?

521
00:37:53,541 --> 00:37:54,750
Uh...

522
00:37:54,833 --> 00:37:58,375
I mean, my mom got it
to keep me out of the house.

523
00:37:59,958 --> 00:38:01,625
Because my stepdad was...

524
00:38:01,708 --> 00:38:03,916
[breathes deeply]

525
00:38:04,625 --> 00:38:05,875
He wasn't a nice person.

526
00:38:07,541 --> 00:38:08,583
I'm sorry.

527
00:38:09,791 --> 00:38:10,791
It's cool.

528
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:13,083
So, are you gonna tell me why you're here?

529
00:38:14,708 --> 00:38:17,333
[chuckling] Come on, Jess.
You do not take time off work,

530
00:38:17,416 --> 00:38:19,958
and I haven't seen you visiting
any relatives. So...

531
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,166
Why are you in this village?

532
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,166
[Jessica]
The little boy in the picture is my dad.

533
00:38:29,583 --> 00:38:32,291
He was adopted from this village
when he was seven.

534
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:35,000
I just found out a few weeks ago

535
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:38,083
when my granddad gave me the picture.

536
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,166
How did they even meet?

537
00:38:41,916 --> 00:38:44,625
My granddad used to own
a factory around here,

538
00:38:45,541 --> 00:38:46,916
you know, back in the day.

539
00:38:48,416 --> 00:38:51,041
And one night there was a fire,

540
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:54,416
and one of his workers
got trapped inside the building.

541
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:58,458
And before anyone could help,

542
00:38:59,916 --> 00:39:01,041
he passed away.

543
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,458
When my granddad went to the funeral,

544
00:39:05,458 --> 00:39:07,625
he met the only family of that worker,

545
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:10,375
his seven-year-old son,

546
00:39:11,166 --> 00:39:12,166
my dad.

547
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:14,708
That's incredible.

548
00:39:14,791 --> 00:39:18,666
Yeah. It is incredible how one small step

549
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:22,041
can just completely change
the course of someone's life.

550
00:39:23,625 --> 00:39:26,500
I mean, if it wasn't for my granddad,

551
00:39:26,583 --> 00:39:29,833
my dad would've spent
his whole life in this village.

552
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:33,625
He wouldn't have ever met my mom.

553
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:36,125
I wouldn't even be here.

554
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,791
How do you feel about that?

555
00:39:40,916 --> 00:39:43,208
I wish he had told me
when he was still alive.

556
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:45,125
But...

557
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,083
But I knew that I needed
to come to this village,

558
00:39:50,416 --> 00:39:54,750
and just be here,
and see where he grew up.

559
00:39:54,833 --> 00:39:57,041
And, you know, meeting all these kids,

560
00:39:57,666 --> 00:40:00,458
it just...
It makes me feel like I'm close to him.

561
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:08,833
You told anyone in the village?

562
00:40:10,791 --> 00:40:13,083
No, I don't want to disrupt anything here.

563
00:40:13,166 --> 00:40:14,583
[chuckles]

564
00:40:16,125 --> 00:40:16,958
What?

565
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:19,291
You just gave those kids skateboards.

566
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,583
You have disrupted everything.

567
00:40:23,541 --> 00:40:26,041
[kids cheering]

568
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:28,333
[upbeat music playing]

569
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:36,500
[cyclist shouts]

570
00:40:36,583 --> 00:40:37,583
[boy shouts]

571
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,250
[man, in Hindi] Hey!

572
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:42,416
Hey, get out!

573
00:40:46,416 --> 00:40:48,208
[Ankush]
Wow, <i>didi</i>, you're doing it so well.

574
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:52,375
- [in English] Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

575
00:41:52,458 --> 00:41:54,708
- [in Hindi] Where is everyone else?
<i>- </i>Skating.

576
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,291
[man 1] They've disrupted everything!

577
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:04,166
Sir, we need your support
to get rid of this problem.

578
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:05,851
- [man 2] Very true.
- [man 3] He's right.

579
00:42:05,875 --> 00:42:07,795
- Take action.
- [man 4] I'll be out of business.

580
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:12,833
[soft instrumental music playing]

581
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:41,000
It was fun skipping school today.

582
00:42:47,041 --> 00:42:50,083
FINE FOR SKATEBOARDING - RS. 500

583
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,958
Five-hundred rupees fine.

584
00:42:53,041 --> 00:42:58,625
BEWARE OF DOGS AND DON'T SKATE HERE.

585
00:43:01,291 --> 00:43:03,541
Stop! What are you doing?

586
00:43:03,625 --> 00:43:05,041
Read that board.

587
00:43:07,875 --> 00:43:10,041
SKATEBOARDING NOT ALLOWED.

588
00:43:10,125 --> 00:43:12,000
[teacher] Today we'll study

589
00:43:12,083 --> 00:43:14,416
about the Father of our Nation,
Mahatma Gandhi,

590
00:43:15,083 --> 00:43:18,708
who led India’s struggle
for independence with non-violence.

591
00:43:20,416 --> 00:43:23,833
Gandhi’s Dandi March, Quit India Movement,

592
00:43:23,916 --> 00:43:28,333
and Salt Tax Revolution
caused an outbreak in the nation.

593
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:34,500
Skating is not a crime.

594
00:43:34,583 --> 00:43:36,416
Not a crime, not a crime.

595
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,166
[Ankush] We kids want to shine.

596
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:40,170
[children chanting]
Want to shine, want to shine.

597
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:42,000
Fulfill our wishes now!

598
00:43:42,083 --> 00:43:43,916
Fulfill them now, fulfill them now.

599
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,875
[Ankush] Skating is not a crime.

600
00:43:45,958 --> 00:43:47,718
[children chanting]
Not a crime, not a crime.

601
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:49,500
We kids want to shine.

602
00:43:49,583 --> 00:43:51,375
Want to shine, want to shine.

603
00:43:51,458 --> 00:43:53,208
Fulfill our wishes now!

604
00:43:53,291 --> 00:43:55,000
Fulfill them now, fulfill them now.

605
00:43:55,083 --> 00:43:56,916
[Ankush] Skating is not a crime.

606
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,541
Look! It’s the teacher! Run!

607
00:43:59,333 --> 00:44:01,000
[upbeat music playing]

608
00:44:11,583 --> 00:44:13,083
Now it’s an everyday nuisance.

609
00:44:13,166 --> 00:44:17,083
Excuse me, you can’t confiscate
their boards like this.

610
00:44:17,166 --> 00:44:18,726
Madam, there’s a complaint against you.

611
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:21,083
[scoffs] What is their crime?

612
00:44:22,083 --> 00:44:25,333
There were only two students
in my class today, thanks to you!

613
00:44:27,375 --> 00:44:30,166
The regular ones are skipping school, too,

614
00:44:30,708 --> 00:44:32,250
because of this nuisance.

615
00:44:33,166 --> 00:44:35,083
And these brats are influencing
my son too!

616
00:44:35,166 --> 00:44:36,500
[in English] Okay, look,

617
00:44:36,583 --> 00:44:38,875
the last thing I want is for them
not to go to school.

618
00:44:38,958 --> 00:44:40,158
Please understand. I'm just...

619
00:44:40,208 --> 00:44:41,750
[in Hindi] Do you have a permit?

620
00:44:42,708 --> 00:44:43,541
[in English] Permit?

621
00:44:43,625 --> 00:44:45,000
[in Hindi] This is India!

622
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:49,125
Things work differently here.
Show me your <i>Aadhaar</i> card.

623
00:44:49,708 --> 00:44:50,809
[in English] I don't have one.

624
00:44:50,833 --> 00:44:52,083
[in Hindi] It’s mandatory.

625
00:44:52,166 --> 00:44:53,566
[in English] I'm a British citizen.

626
00:44:53,625 --> 00:44:55,916
- [in Hindi] Show me your passport.
- [scoffs]

627
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,750
This is the root cause of the problem.

628
00:44:57,833 --> 00:45:00,041
- Just hear me out, please...
- Listen to me, madam.

629
00:45:00,541 --> 00:45:02,291
You’re still an Indian, aren’t you?

630
00:45:02,375 --> 00:45:03,375
Yes, do you doubt it?

631
00:45:03,458 --> 00:45:05,375
Then why bring these Western things here?

632
00:45:05,458 --> 00:45:07,258
[in English]
They're kids. They're having fun.

633
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:08,750
They're playing, learning a sport.

634
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:13,666
These kids can't be skating like that
in the middle of the streets.

635
00:45:15,375 --> 00:45:18,083
[in Hindi] They start skating anywhere,
from shops and alleys

636
00:45:18,166 --> 00:45:21,666
to places
where they aren't even allowed to enter.

637
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:23,791
They've created chaos
in the whole village.

638
00:45:23,875 --> 00:45:26,125
Look, madam, we have a system here.

639
00:45:26,916 --> 00:45:27,916
There are rules.

640
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:31,083
They’re ruining public property.

641
00:45:31,833 --> 00:45:33,583
It's not a garden or a park.

642
00:45:34,208 --> 00:45:38,541
Vikram, she’s your guest and a lady,
so I’m letting her go.

643
00:45:38,625 --> 00:45:40,875
- Yes.
- If I get one more complaint...

644
00:45:41,625 --> 00:45:43,425
[in English]
I’ll have to take serious action.

645
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:46,916
- [in Hindi] It won't happen again.
- [police officer] You can go.

646
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,600
[quietly] Singh Sahab, take it in writing,
or they’ll do it again.

647
00:45:55,208 --> 00:45:58,708
Listen, if any of you
miss school tomorrow then...

648
00:45:58,791 --> 00:46:01,875
[in English] I won't let that happen.
I'll make sure they're there tomorrow.

649
00:46:05,125 --> 00:46:06,125
Guys!

650
00:46:08,375 --> 00:46:09,583
[Erick sighs heavily]

651
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:12,750
Doesn't matter where you go in the world,
everybody hates skateboards.

652
00:46:12,833 --> 00:46:15,500
[somber music playing]

653
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,500
[sentimental music playing]

654
00:48:05,541 --> 00:48:06,541
[Prerna] <i>Didi!</i>

655
00:48:09,583 --> 00:48:11,333
[in Hindi] What are you doing here?

656
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,833
This is the upper caste locality.

657
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:17,000
Do people still follow the caste system?

658
00:48:18,875 --> 00:48:21,958
Nobody talks about it,
but it's an unsaid norm.

659
00:48:25,291 --> 00:48:27,333
I am sorry that you can’t skate anymore.

660
00:48:28,625 --> 00:48:30,458
[in English] I thought... I mean, I...

661
00:48:32,125 --> 00:48:33,708
Those boards were a waste.

662
00:48:35,125 --> 00:48:37,750
[in Hindi] Skating is
the best thing that happened to me.

663
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:45,041
How long are you here for?

664
00:48:46,208 --> 00:48:47,541
I leave tomorrow.

665
00:48:51,791 --> 00:48:55,166
But there’s still so much to see here.

666
00:49:01,625 --> 00:49:02,625
[in English] Sit.

667
00:49:03,833 --> 00:49:04,833
It's okay.

668
00:49:05,458 --> 00:49:06,458
Sit.

669
00:49:09,291 --> 00:49:11,291
[soft instrumental music playing]

670
00:50:15,375 --> 00:50:17,041
[Erick] You been here all night?

671
00:50:18,041 --> 00:50:21,125
You know, people don't hate skaters.
They hate their spirit.

672
00:50:21,833 --> 00:50:25,458
I've been researching all night,
and there is no skate park in Rajasthan.

673
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Okay.

674
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:31,916
[chuckles]

675
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,625
[Jessica] Skateboarding is just
in a few places in India.

676
00:50:34,708 --> 00:50:36,916
- It's just picking up.
- [Erick] Yeah, I know.

677
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:41,625
- Uh, let me get this straight. You want...
- I wanna build a skate park.

678
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:42,708
[laughs]

679
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:44,375
- [Vikram] Skate park?
- Yeah.

680
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:46,291
- [in Hindi] In this village?
- [Jessica] Yes.

681
00:50:46,375 --> 00:50:48,095
[in English]
Do you have this kind of money?

682
00:50:48,541 --> 00:50:51,916
Uh, I actually just gave up
a huge promotion at work, so no.

683
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,166
But I really need to do this.

684
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:55,970
[Vikram]
It'll be a huge tourist attraction.

685
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,500
- Exactly.
- I am with you, ma'am. No issues.

686
00:50:59,125 --> 00:51:01,041
Thank you, Vikram. And you?

687
00:51:03,458 --> 00:51:05,375
- I'm going to Bangalore.
- What?

688
00:51:05,458 --> 00:51:06,708
[in Hindi] Hey. Hey, <i>bhai.</i>

689
00:51:06,791 --> 00:51:08,833
[in English]
If you go, who's going to help us?

690
00:51:09,416 --> 00:51:11,708
Well, see,
if we're gonna build a skate park,

691
00:51:11,791 --> 00:51:14,375
we're gonna need a team,
and my guy is in Bangalore.

692

693
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:17,250

694
00:51:17,333 --> 00:51:19,083
Yes! We're doing it!

695
00:51:19,666 --> 00:51:21,208
Thank you.

696
00:51:21,833 --> 00:51:24,208
Thank you, Vikram. Wow.

697
00:51:24,291 --> 00:51:26,000
We're building a skate park.

698
00:51:31,083 --> 00:51:36,291
[children] "No school. No skateboarding."

699
00:51:37,541 --> 00:51:40,125
Yay! No school! Yay!

700
00:51:40,208 --> 00:51:42,000
- [in Hindi] Tipya, no school.
- No!

701
00:51:42,083 --> 00:51:43,916
Ankush, no.

702
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,166
This means if you don’t go to school,
you won’t be allowed to skate.

703
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:49,750
- What?
- [Jessica] Yes.

704
00:51:49,833 --> 00:51:50,916
[in English] It’s a rule.

705
00:51:52,875 --> 00:51:55,208
[in Hindi]
They come up with new rules every day.

706
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:07,125
[children, in English] Good morning, sir.

707
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:10,250
Good morning.

708
00:52:10,333 --> 00:52:11,333
[in Hindi] Sit down.

709
00:52:17,041 --> 00:52:18,041
Hmm.

710
00:52:19,458 --> 00:52:21,583
- [in English] Nice.
- Thank you.

711
00:52:22,208 --> 00:52:24,291
Big goals. Very nice.

712
00:52:25,166 --> 00:52:27,166
[in Hindi]
No one has ever thought this way before.

713
00:52:27,208 --> 00:52:29,333
[in English] Very nice. Very nice.

714
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:31,875
Who is actually involved?

715
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:34,708
Your father? Husband?

716
00:52:34,791 --> 00:52:36,708
Um, no, it's just me.

717
00:52:36,791 --> 00:52:37,958
- [in Hindi] Alone?
- Hmm.

718
00:52:38,041 --> 00:52:40,458
[in English] Very nice. Very nice.

719
00:52:40,541 --> 00:52:42,458
With funds sanctioned from the government,

720
00:52:42,541 --> 00:52:44,750
we can make
an international-standard skate park.

721
00:52:45,583 --> 00:52:47,458
That is very expensive, madam.

722
00:52:48,458 --> 00:52:50,875
[in Hindi]
How can I sanction that kind of money?

723
00:52:52,041 --> 00:52:55,000
Our charity funds
have already been allotted for this year.

724
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:57,750
Besides, you’re not from an official NGO.

725
00:52:57,833 --> 00:52:59,291
Try next year.

726
00:53:00,041 --> 00:53:02,625
[in English] After registration. Promise.

727
00:53:02,708 --> 00:53:05,666
[in Hindi] And if you need any other help,
let me know. Hmm?

728
00:53:06,541 --> 00:53:09,791
- [in English] Actually...
- Your minister is here to help you. Hmm?

729
00:53:09,875 --> 00:53:10,875
Always.

730
00:53:14,125 --> 00:53:16,416
[in Hindi] We can’t justify these funds.

731
00:53:17,541 --> 00:53:19,000
This game...

732
00:53:19,083 --> 00:53:20,208
I mean sport.

733
00:53:20,291 --> 00:53:21,291
It has no rules.

734
00:53:22,833 --> 00:53:25,541
How can I propose a sport
with no rules to the committee?

735
00:53:26,458 --> 00:53:28,833
The Sports Association
won't be able to help you.

736
00:53:28,916 --> 00:53:31,250
Why don’t you try
for private or personal funding?

737
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:33,708
[in English]
I'll do that. Thank you. Let's go.

738
00:53:42,041 --> 00:53:45,458
None of these guys are gonna help us.
There is nothing in it for them.

739
00:53:46,875 --> 00:53:49,208
Ma'am, they don't understand
why you are doing this.

740
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,416
We need a higher up connection
to get things done here.

741
00:54:06,541 --> 00:54:07,375
<i>Namaste</i>.

742
00:54:07,458 --> 00:54:09,000
I heard about your project.

743
00:54:10,125 --> 00:54:12,708
No one has ever dared
to ask my land before.

744
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,083
I know it's a really big ask.

745
00:54:15,875 --> 00:54:20,791
[in Hindi] Why do you want to build
this skate park in that village?

746
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,250
I was raised in London.

747
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,833
I knew what I wanted to be
while I was still in school.

748
00:54:28,583 --> 00:54:30,864
[in English] When I asked
one of the girls in the village...

749
00:54:30,916 --> 00:54:33,416
[in Hindi]
"What do you want to do when you grow up?"

750
00:54:34,208 --> 00:54:36,958
She had no answer.

751
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,791
Because no one
had ever asked her that before.

752
00:54:44,166 --> 00:54:45,246
[in English] It crushed me.

753
00:54:46,125 --> 00:54:48,541
They are so wonderful

754
00:54:49,125 --> 00:54:51,625
and creative with the little they have.

755
00:54:52,291 --> 00:54:53,375
And I look at them,

756
00:54:53,458 --> 00:54:57,708
and I wonder if we would discover
a scientist, or a musician, you know,

757
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:00,125
or the next pro-skater
right here in this village

758
00:55:00,208 --> 00:55:03,708
if we just give them a platform
and someone to believe in them.

759
00:55:04,708 --> 00:55:07,666
And I don't know why,
but skating strikes a chord with them.

760
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:12,541
I know a girl who says
that when she skates, she feels free.

761
00:55:17,083 --> 00:55:21,083
For the first time, she's allowed herself
to dream, you know, and that inspires me.

762
00:55:22,583 --> 00:55:26,583
Now, boys and girls from different castes,
who would never even usually mingle,

763
00:55:26,666 --> 00:55:28,291
are now all skating together.

764
00:55:30,416 --> 00:55:33,125
I mean, if we don't give
these girls a chance, then who will?

765
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:38,291
[woman] Please give me a moment.

766
00:55:39,291 --> 00:55:40,416
[chair moving]

767
00:55:41,166 --> 00:55:43,166
[footsteps receding]

768
00:55:50,916 --> 00:55:53,416
[in Hindi]
I was thinking about what you said.

769
00:55:54,583 --> 00:55:57,333
People resist change here,

770
00:55:58,083 --> 00:56:01,791
especially if that change
is led by a woman.

771
00:56:02,416 --> 00:56:06,333
There are unsaid rules for women here,

772
00:56:06,916 --> 00:56:08,666
some of which you’ve already broken.

773
00:56:12,166 --> 00:56:15,125
If I deny you today,

774
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:19,333
life will go on as is.

775
00:56:20,458 --> 00:56:22,083
But if I say yes,

776
00:56:22,166 --> 00:56:25,041
maybe we’ll see a better tomorrow?

777
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,291
And it could give several girls

778
00:56:29,375 --> 00:56:34,750
the courage to follow their dreams.

779
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:37,291
[sniffles]

780
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:40,541
Someday I’ll tell you my story.

781
00:56:41,458 --> 00:56:43,291
But for now, start your work.

782
00:56:43,875 --> 00:56:44,958

coming from all over India.

[in Hindi] Skaters from all over India
will participate in the contest.

You will each get a 45-second run,

as many tricks as you can.

No, you get back on the board.

846

A whistle will blow
after 45 seconds are over,

847
01:01:41,708 --> 01:01:43,250
which means your time is up.

848
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:48,291

850

Yeah?

852

I hadn't even seen your father
before our wedding.

1159
01:25:48,375 --> 01:25:50,416
I was about your age when I got married.

1160

I was very weak,

I bled a lot when you were born.

1164
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,416
The doctor said I had a weak uterus
and had to be careful.

1165
01:26:09,250 --> 01:26:11,375
That's why you were premature by a month,

1166
01:26:13,375 --> 01:26:16,250
but girls born in the eighth month
have a fighting spirit.

1167

That’s why you’re here today.

1168
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:23,416
Weren’t you weak when Ankush was born?

1169
01:26:25,666 --> 01:26:29,666
I was, but a girl child isn't enough
to complete a family.

Everyone wants a son.

1171
01:26:34,875 --> 01:26:37,250

And a wonderful foot-twisting trick!

1223

Our skate village is rocking it!

Papa, that fabric fell off.

1225
01:30:12,666 --> 01:30:14,583
Okay, go keep this plate inside.

1226

You're still here?
You can't do one thing right.

1227

1234
01:33:30,291 --> 01:33:31,958

[Vikram]
Wow. Mini is landing trick after trick.

1247
01:35:32,125 --> 01:35:35,125
And that's an impressive trick.
I don't even know what it's called.

1248
01:35:35,208 --> 01:35:38,708
Our little shredders are getting
a lot of inspiration today. Right?

1249

Now what can be better than

1252
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:55,125
the queen herself gracing us
with her presence?

1253
01:35:55,625 --> 01:35:57,101

towards the monster bowl!

1275

Before announcing the winners,

1283
01:39:19,583 --> 01:39:21,958
I'd like to say that,

1284
01:39:22,583 --> 01:39:25,916
for the first time,
I'm seeing such joy in this village.

1285
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:31,416
If we just give our kids
that one opportunity,

1286
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:37,333
maybe someday we'll find
a world champion from this village.

1287
01:39:40,625 --> 01:39:44,083
But a champion isn’t someone
who just wins.

1288
01:39:45,583 --> 01:39:51,208
A true champion is someone
who shows courage,

1289
01:39:51,291 --> 01:39:53,833
passion and determination
when faced with adversity.

1290
01:39:55,041 --> 01:39:57,541
You did an amazing drop in. Come.

1291
01:39:58,541 --> 01:40:02,375
[queen] And today I witnessed
that courage and determination in someone.

1292
01:40:03,208 --> 01:40:05,708
I would like to give that person
a special award.

1293
