1
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:45,004
Come on, let's go.

2
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:47,007
Go.

3
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:16,268
Mr. delphino,

4
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:18,704
Tommy sweeney on one.

5
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:22,274
Yeah, Roman, it's Tommy.

6
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:24,177
The safari was a success.

7
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:29,999
But the launch time has been
delayed five days.

8
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,840
But the launch time has been
delayed five days.

9
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:35,354
I think now it's time
we renegotiate

10
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:37,190
the terms of my duty.

11
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,161
Renegotiate?

12
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,162
Yeah.

13
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,498
We should be equal, Roman.

14
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:48,367
I mean, I want
an equal share of the spoils,

15
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:51,671
because either of us
could drop a dime on the other

16
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,340
at any time, you know?

17
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,374
Besides,

18
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,443
with five extra days,

19
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:59,445
we could bag another trophy.

20
00:02:59,446 --> 00:02:59,999
The money's out there,

21
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,647
the money's out there,

22
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:04,016
walking around in skirts.

23
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,651
So how about it?

24
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:08,220
Want to?

25
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,157
You ready for another hunt?

26
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,043
Bus number nine
from gatlin, Nebraska

27
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,612
is now arriving in area six.

28
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,647
Excuse me.

29
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:44,416
Oh, I'm sorry.

30
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,318
Hollywood, you from Ohio, right?

31
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,753
Please, no, thank you.

32
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,688
Attention, please.

33
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,223
Golden tours night service

34
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,726
to palmdale, Lancaster,

35
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:56,061
mojave, bishop Henry

36
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:57,663
now loading at...

37
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,999
Everything is everything, baby.

38
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,000
That's right, honey.

39
00:05:00,001 --> 00:05:01,167
That's right, honey.

40
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:02,334
I'm down.

41
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,737
Check this out.

42
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:07,174
Cute girlfriend walking down
the street.

43
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,016
Detective sergeant teffler.

44
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:18,752
I just got a tip
you're about to be robbed.

45
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,055
Can't you stop them?

46
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,123
If we catch them in the act,

47
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:25,325
they're gonna serve real time.

48
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,065
Guess who.

49
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,739
Okay, everyone on the floor!

50
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,474
Face down!

51
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:43,475
Now!

52
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,211
Down now!

53
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:46,212
Move it!

54
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:48,480
Now!

55
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,216
Get that security door open
fast!

56
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:51,651
Now!

57
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:03,563
Damn.

58
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:09,535
The vault.

59
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,370
Where's the safe, asshole?

60
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,240
Move it!

61
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:15,341
Get it open.

62
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:16,609
Get it open now!

63
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,577
Come on, let's go! Let's go!

64
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,546
Drop your weapon.

65
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,548
Drop it.

66
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,416
Hands behind your head slowly.

67
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,719
Slowly.

68
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,255
Get back!

69
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:37,162
Okay, don't anyone move!

70
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:39,331
You, get down!

71
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,133
Now!

72
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:43,103
Come on, hurry up in there!

73
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:50,709
You, you!

74
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,178
Get up! Get up!

75
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:55,014
Oh, my god.

76
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:57,583
Hold it!

77
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:58,584
Get back, man.

78
00:06:58,585 --> 00:06:59,999
I swear to god I'll kill her.

79
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,160
I swear to god I'll kill her.

80
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,690
What are you?

81
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:06,493
What are you, crazy?

82
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:12,197
I'll kill her.

83
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:13,332
Don't take this personally.

84
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,034
I said drop the gun,
or I'll kill her.

85
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:16,169
I'll kill her!

86
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,507
Verga, verga...

87
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,745
I thought you said
this was your sister.

88
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:00,000
She is.

89
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:01,146
She is.

90
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,716
She goes by her married name.

91
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:08,253
Osterman.

92
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:11,090
That's it, osterman.

93
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:12,725
I thought you said she was 16.

94
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,059
No.

95
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,761
She looks 16.

96
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:19,231
She's really... 18.

97
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:23,168
Osterman.

98
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:27,239
She also goes
by the name of Bambi.

99
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,640
Sometimes.

100
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:29,999
Hey, you heard from the captain?

101
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,010
Hey, you heard from the captain?

102
00:08:30,011 --> 00:08:32,244
Hey, sparks.

103
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:33,345
You know this guy?

104
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,646
This is sparks Morris.

105
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,315
He's reporting a missing girl.

106
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:38,283
Yeah, and last month,
it was Darlene.

107
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:39,752
You cops don't do shit.

108
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:42,221
What did he say? He was
a human resources director?

109
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:44,056
This guy's a pimp.

110
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:45,991
Okay, fine.

111
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:47,126
We don't count.

112
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:48,293
We got no rights.

113
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:50,062
Fine.

114
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:51,663
Fuck you all.

115
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:52,532
Hey.

116
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,999
Well, I hear you're back doing

117
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,373
well, I hear you're back doing

118
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:03,275
your street justice thing again.

119
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:05,377
You know how it is
on the street.

120
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,712
You know,
you're acting just like

121
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,147
one of those punk kids out there

122
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:09,214
trying to hustle the corner.

123
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,983
Now, that's not true.

124
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,518
I got a house now.

125
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,686
Sergeant teffler.

126
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:17,990
Teffler.

127
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:19,358
I have got lawsuits,

128
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,325
hospital bills,

129
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,127
traumatized witnesses,

130
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,328
public outrage,

131
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:25,297
just because one
junior detective

132
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,565
can't follow procedure.

133
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,368
I called for backup.
You should have waited!

134
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:29,999
Hey,
see me about that body work.

135
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,203
Hey,
see me about that body work.

136
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:32,972
I got a guy who can do it
half price.

137
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:37,509
You don't get it, do you?

138
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,712
Watch dogs is pressuring me
to suspend you.

139
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:44,583
Is this the stack on forensics?

140
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,018
Yes, sir, captain.

141
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,453
Good.

142
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:50,155
Look, you put citizens at risk.

143
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,024
You set up those people
in the store like bait.

144
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:53,192
Bait.

145
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,694
The bait's what put these
assholes in jail.

146
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:58,564
Oh, and now you're gonna set
their jail terms.

147
00:09:58,565 --> 00:09:59,999
Hey, would you get me
the Conway autopsy?

148
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,732
Hey, would you get me
the Conway autopsy?

149
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:03,203
And will you ask your dad
how many cassettes he wants?

150
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,174
I knew I was taking a risk

151
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,376
letting you work alone.

152
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:14,046
You're the youngest detective
who's ever had that privilege.

153
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:16,014
Privilege, yeah.

154
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:19,017
Now, do I have to assign you
to a partner?

155
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:19,985
No, sir.

156
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,421
Okay.

157
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:23,556
Okay.

158
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:29,361
What's this?

159
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:29,999
Lorenzo fiero, real estate?

160
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,131
Lorenzo fiero, real estate?

161
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,966
My brother-in-law.

162
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:37,202
Wants to buy your house.

163
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:39,004
Sell it, kid. Get rich.

164
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:39,972
Thank you.

165
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,307
Retire.

166
00:11:32,006 --> 00:11:34,441
Merci?

167
00:11:34,442 --> 00:11:35,843
Merci?

168
00:11:55,296 --> 00:11:56,863
Murky?

169
00:11:56,864 --> 00:11:59,000
Merci, my dear.

170
00:12:05,306 --> 00:12:08,408
And who gave you my name,
may I ask?

171
00:12:08,409 --> 00:12:10,344
Mikey.

172
00:12:10,345 --> 00:12:14,181
Did he, uh--

173
00:12:14,182 --> 00:12:17,385
Did he tell you what I like?

174
00:12:27,756 --> 00:12:29,999
Oh, Mikey from Jamaica.

175
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,060
Oh, Mikey from Jamaica.

176
00:12:32,061 --> 00:12:34,796
He used to fly me to Kingston
every week

177
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:37,832
when I was dating
that record producer.

178
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:41,936
He wanted to give me
a recording contract,

179
00:12:41,937 --> 00:12:44,038
marry me,

180
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:46,041
set me up in a mansion.

181
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,685
But I couldn't do that.

182
00:12:57,686 --> 00:12:59,999
I must remain my own.

183
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,956
I must remain my own.

184
00:13:01,957 --> 00:13:05,927
Self-determined.

185
00:13:05,928 --> 00:13:07,897
And I don't take orders.

186
00:13:10,032 --> 00:13:13,768
And I can't abide men...

187
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:16,338
Who are lazy, cowardly...

188
00:13:21,944 --> 00:13:23,245
Weak.

189
00:13:42,331 --> 00:13:44,098
Hey!

190
00:13:44,099 --> 00:13:45,668
What the hell are you doing?

191
00:13:49,238 --> 00:13:51,239
Tommy.

192
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,142
Your buddies didn't forget.

193
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,613
Happy birthday.

194
00:13:58,614 --> 00:13:59,781
What the fuck?

195
00:13:59,782 --> 00:14:00,000
Hey!

196
00:14:00,001 --> 00:14:00,748
Hey!

197
00:14:00,749 --> 00:14:04,652
Hey, come back here, you bitch!

198
00:14:04,653 --> 00:14:06,355
It's not my birthday!

199
00:14:28,711 --> 00:14:29,999
Alvarez!

200
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,500
Alvarez!

201
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,947
Darling.

202
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:07,149
Okay.

203
00:15:10,052 --> 00:15:11,286
Hey.

204
00:15:25,142 --> 00:15:26,275
Tommy, you're amazing.

205
00:15:26,276 --> 00:15:27,810
You know that?

206
00:15:27,811 --> 00:15:29,846
You have balls of steel.

207
00:15:32,482 --> 00:15:35,318
But you've got
a good deal going,

208
00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:38,454
an easy scam for big money,

209
00:15:38,455 --> 00:15:40,323
and you're willing
to throw it away

210
00:15:40,324 --> 00:15:42,492
because you've decided
you deserve more.

211
00:15:44,728 --> 00:15:46,563
Knowing the kind of man I am...

212
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:51,867
I mean,
that's not just ambition.

213
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:54,170
That takes nerves like lasers.

214
00:15:54,171 --> 00:15:58,407
I saw that once hunting
the white tiger in sumatra.

215
00:15:58,408 --> 00:15:59,999
The sheer willpower of that.

216
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,120
The sheer willpower of that.

217
00:16:02,512 --> 00:16:05,348
Pure.

218
00:16:05,349 --> 00:16:06,482
I mean,

219
00:16:06,483 --> 00:16:08,884
I'm fucking afraid of you,
Tommy.

220
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,786
I know you're pissed,
Roman, but listen.

221
00:16:10,787 --> 00:16:12,321
Just listen.

222
00:16:12,322 --> 00:16:15,358
I always listen to people
I respect.

223
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,860
I am going to make it up to you.

224
00:16:17,861 --> 00:16:21,631
Yeah?

225
00:16:21,632 --> 00:16:22,866
Thank you.

226
00:16:28,772 --> 00:16:29,999
But I'd rather
shoot your balls off.

227
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,400
But I'd rather
shoot your balls off.

228
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:56,298
I'd rule out suicide.

229
00:16:56,299 --> 00:16:59,402
Powder markings suggest
the use of a sound repressor.

230
00:16:59,403 --> 00:16:59,999
You mean silencer.

231
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,569
You mean silencer.

232
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,672
The only sound would have been
that of his screams

233
00:17:02,673 --> 00:17:05,241
as he expired
from fluid depletion.

234
00:17:05,242 --> 00:17:07,710
You mean he bled to death.

235
00:17:07,711 --> 00:17:11,147
You really love this job,
don't you, Laurie?

236
00:17:11,148 --> 00:17:13,849
I enjoy uncovering secrets.

237
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:16,385
You know who did this,
don't you?

238
00:17:16,386 --> 00:17:18,755
Someone who was angry at his...

239
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:24,727
Could a woman get that pent up?

240
00:17:24,728 --> 00:17:28,197
Absolutely.

241
00:17:28,198 --> 00:17:29,565
Sergeant.

242
00:17:29,566 --> 00:17:30,000
We need you outside.

243
00:17:30,001 --> 00:17:31,434
We need you outside.

244
00:17:31,435 --> 00:17:34,537
What do you got there, Johnny,
a phone number?

245
00:17:34,538 --> 00:17:36,406
Okay.
Bag that watch for me, okay?

246
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:39,709
Mr. Birnbaum.

247
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,143
Ernie. Ernie.

248
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:42,712
Detective teffler.

249
00:17:42,713 --> 00:17:44,547
Ernie, this woman
that came through tonight--

250
00:17:44,548 --> 00:17:46,182
I don't know anything
about a woman.

251
00:17:46,183 --> 00:17:47,450
Ernie, Ernie, Ernie,

252
00:17:47,451 --> 00:17:51,420
buddy, you already admitted
you talked to this lady.

253
00:17:51,421 --> 00:17:53,289
Ernie, let's say this lady
was a hooker, okay?

254
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:55,491
Just a theory now.

255
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:57,860
Let's say this hooker killed
Mr. Tommy sweeney.

256
00:17:57,861 --> 00:17:59,829
That means if you protect her,
my friend,

257
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:00,000
that makes you an accessory.

258
00:18:00,001 --> 00:18:01,630
That makes you an accessory.

259
00:18:01,631 --> 00:18:02,832
You got that?

260
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,867
But, of course,
there's always the possibility

261
00:18:04,868 --> 00:18:06,268
that she didn't kill him.

262
00:18:06,269 --> 00:18:07,870
She may have just let
that killer into the room.

263
00:18:07,871 --> 00:18:10,306
Now, the only person we know
she talked to before, I mean,

264
00:18:10,307 --> 00:18:11,507
the only one
we know of for sure,

265
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:12,508
would be you, my friend.

266
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:13,676
Oh, you've got to be kidding.

267
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:14,643
No, sir, I am not kidding.

268
00:18:14,644 --> 00:18:16,746
This is no joke.

269
00:18:16,747 --> 00:18:18,414
Now,
either you cooperate with me,

270
00:18:18,415 --> 00:18:19,482
you answer these questions,

271
00:18:19,483 --> 00:18:20,883
or I'm gonna drag your ass
downtown,

272
00:18:20,884 --> 00:18:22,752
I'm gonna stick you in
a room and leave you there.

273
00:18:22,753 --> 00:18:24,453
I might go have some lunch.
I might go--

274
00:18:24,454 --> 00:18:26,356
All right, all right, all right.

275
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:29,725
She's merci cooper.

276
00:18:29,726 --> 00:18:30,000
She's a regular.

277
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:31,794
She's a regular.

278
00:18:31,795 --> 00:18:32,895
Who does she work for?

279
00:18:32,896 --> 00:18:35,298
No, she's off the boulevard.

280
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,736
Do me a favor.

281
00:18:40,737 --> 00:18:42,505
This is my number, okay?

282
00:18:42,506 --> 00:18:44,841
You talk to her, you see her,
you give me a call.

283
00:18:47,018 --> 00:18:48,685
I want to get an a.P.B.
On merci cooper.

284
00:18:48,686 --> 00:18:50,454
Check Tommy sweeney's record
for me.

285
00:18:50,455 --> 00:18:52,222
I'm gonna get a search warrant
on this joint.

286
00:18:52,223 --> 00:18:53,423
All right.

287
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,225
You seen sweeney before?
You recognize him?

288
00:18:55,226 --> 00:18:56,627
Nah.

289
00:18:56,628 --> 00:18:58,161
Looks familiar to me.

290
00:18:58,162 --> 00:18:59,630
Listen, the hooker did it.

291
00:18:59,631 --> 00:19:00,000
He probably
tried something kinky,

292
00:19:00,001 --> 00:19:01,231
he probably
tried something kinky,

293
00:19:01,232 --> 00:19:02,265
and she got pissed.

294
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,667
Pissed? How pissed?

295
00:19:03,668 --> 00:19:05,102
Pissed off enough
to kill the guy

296
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:07,204
and leave a $10,000 watch
on the dresser?

297
00:19:07,205 --> 00:19:08,739
So she shot him
and then panicked.

298
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,340
She used a silencer.

299
00:19:10,341 --> 00:19:13,310
This thing was planned.
She didn't panic.

300
00:19:13,311 --> 00:19:15,012
Check that out for me, okay?
Okay.

301
00:19:15,013 --> 00:19:16,613
Detective.

302
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,615
Merci couldn't have done this.
He's not a killer.

303
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:19,750
Listen, I hope you're right.

304
00:19:19,751 --> 00:19:21,551
But this chick's
in a lot of danger, okay?

305
00:19:21,552 --> 00:19:22,619
She wouldn't happen to be

306
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,488
in one of these rooms
back here, would she?

307
00:19:24,489 --> 00:19:26,657
You wouldn't happen to have
a search warrant, would you?

308
00:19:26,658 --> 00:19:29,494
You're starting
to get on my nerves.

309
00:19:46,511 --> 00:19:48,646
Just wait.

310
00:20:07,098 --> 00:20:09,133
Go ahead, Dale.
I'm with you in spirit.

311
00:20:12,203 --> 00:20:14,504
Hello, this is merci.

312
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:15,706
It's sparks.

313
00:20:15,707 --> 00:20:18,508
20 bucks,
and the data involved danger.

314
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:21,178
Be right back. No shit.

315
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:22,612
I steered you right before.

316
00:20:22,613 --> 00:20:25,382
When were you left
holding the bag, huh?

317
00:20:25,383 --> 00:20:28,518
Okay, you got it.

318
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:29,999
The police are looking
for you in the connection

319
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,687
the police are looking
for you in the connection

320
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:33,056
with the murder
of one Tommy sweeney.

321
00:20:33,057 --> 00:20:35,625
They already got
your beeper number.

322
00:20:35,626 --> 00:20:36,993
You better lay low, baby.

323
00:20:36,994 --> 00:20:39,564
This time you screwed up royale.

324
00:22:46,123 --> 00:22:47,958
Excuse me.

325
00:22:47,959 --> 00:22:50,727
Do you live here?

326
00:22:50,728 --> 00:22:53,230
I'm looking for merci cooper.

327
00:22:53,231 --> 00:22:54,732
Wait! I'm a police officer!

328
00:23:25,327 --> 00:23:26,394
Don't come near me.

329
00:23:26,395 --> 00:23:27,762
It's okay, I'm a police--

330
00:23:27,763 --> 00:23:29,330
get the hell away from me,
or I'll scream.

331
00:23:29,331 --> 00:23:29,999
It's okay. It's okay.

332
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,965
It's okay. It's okay.

333
00:23:30,966 --> 00:23:33,367
Are you merci cooper?

334
00:23:33,368 --> 00:23:35,703
What's the matter?
What's the matter?

335
00:23:35,704 --> 00:23:37,673
Jesus.

336
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,051
I just want to talk to you.

337
00:23:50,052 --> 00:23:54,021
Here--whoa!

338
00:23:54,022 --> 00:23:57,692
Okay, she's 17,
and she's clean, teff.

339
00:23:57,693 --> 00:23:59,999
Grade "b" student.

340
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,362
Grade "b" student.

341
00:24:00,363 --> 00:24:02,364
Drama club, dancing.

342
00:24:05,233 --> 00:24:08,970
Ten days ago, her old lady
died of a liver ailment.

343
00:24:08,971 --> 00:24:11,339
Three days ago,
her stepdad took her in.

344
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,341
She left.

345
00:24:15,377 --> 00:24:18,346
Skipped school,
cleaned out her bank account,

346
00:24:18,347 --> 00:24:21,415
bought a bus ticket.

347
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:24,019
No wants,
no warrants, no runaways.

348
00:24:25,954 --> 00:24:28,623
Kid's a virgin.

349
00:24:28,624 --> 00:24:29,992
I doubt that.

350
00:24:32,728 --> 00:24:36,731
No sister? She said
something about a sister.

351
00:24:36,732 --> 00:24:38,633
Nope.

352
00:24:38,634 --> 00:24:41,802
And she's got
to be a virgin liar.

353
00:24:41,803 --> 00:24:44,171
With one street move.

354
00:24:44,172 --> 00:24:46,174
That you never saw before.

355
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,920
Here you go.

356
00:24:59,921 --> 00:25:00,000
Why don't you put these on?

357
00:25:00,001 --> 00:25:01,789
Why don't you put these on?

358
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,659
What? Jail clothes?

359
00:25:06,128 --> 00:25:07,895
Why am I here?

360
00:25:07,896 --> 00:25:09,230
Well, I don't know.

361
00:25:09,231 --> 00:25:12,400
Assaulting a police officer,
resisting arrest.

362
00:25:12,401 --> 00:25:14,402
How was I supposed to know that?

363
00:25:14,403 --> 00:25:16,804
You look like a pervert.

364
00:25:16,805 --> 00:25:18,339
You can change right in here.

365
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,807
Why?

366
00:25:19,808 --> 00:25:21,308
Have you got video cameras
in there?

367
00:25:21,309 --> 00:25:23,045
In your fondest dreams.

368
00:25:27,282 --> 00:25:29,999
So, Kyle, you said that, uh,

369
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,052
so, Kyle, you said that, uh,

370
00:25:30,053 --> 00:25:32,920
merci cooper was your sister,
right?

371
00:25:32,921 --> 00:25:35,156
Yeah, she's my half sister.

372
00:25:35,157 --> 00:25:39,160
Do you--do you know
if she's changed her address

373
00:25:39,161 --> 00:25:41,295
or anything like that?

374
00:25:41,296 --> 00:25:42,863
I don't know.

375
00:25:42,864 --> 00:25:45,033
We haven't exactly
kept in touch.

376
00:25:47,803 --> 00:25:49,938
She sent me a postcard
a while ago.

377
00:25:52,407 --> 00:25:53,307
Could I see it?

378
00:25:53,308 --> 00:25:55,209
Could you leave me alone,
please?

379
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:59,213
You cops, you think
you can do anything you want.

380
00:25:59,214 --> 00:25:59,999
Especially to women.

381
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,682
Especially to women.

382
00:26:01,683 --> 00:26:03,384
Kyle,

383
00:26:03,385 --> 00:26:05,953
your sister's
in some serious trouble.

384
00:26:05,954 --> 00:26:08,322
She's a professional
Hollywood singer.

385
00:26:08,323 --> 00:26:09,790
No.

386
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:11,511
She's been doing
a little more than singing.

387
00:26:13,995 --> 00:26:17,998
What's she been doing?

388
00:26:17,999 --> 00:26:19,634
Could I see the postcard please?

389
00:26:25,387 --> 00:26:26,522
Thank you.

390
00:26:28,557 --> 00:26:29,999
Roman's temple?

391
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,825
Roman's temple?

392
00:26:30,826 --> 00:26:32,560
I know this place.

393
00:26:32,561 --> 00:26:34,295
How old's this thing?

394
00:26:34,296 --> 00:26:36,297
A year.

395
00:26:36,298 --> 00:26:38,600
Soliciting
an undercover vice officer?

396
00:26:41,603 --> 00:26:43,271
You want to arrest her?

397
00:26:43,272 --> 00:26:44,739
Sergeant.

398
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,474
You think my sister's a hooker?

399
00:26:46,475 --> 00:26:48,976
Sergeant, are you insulting
this poor girl?

400
00:26:48,977 --> 00:26:50,645
Yeah, he is.

401
00:26:50,646 --> 00:26:51,746
And would you please tell him

402
00:26:51,747 --> 00:26:53,381
to keep his hands off of me?

403
00:26:53,382 --> 00:26:54,282
Look, let's just go.

404
00:26:54,283 --> 00:26:55,416
Thank you.

405
00:26:55,417 --> 00:26:57,385
Tommy sweeney's record.

406
00:26:57,386 --> 00:26:59,999
Used to be a bouncer
at Roman's temple.

407
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,456
Used to be a bouncer
at Roman's temple.

408
00:27:00,457 --> 00:27:01,790
Check it out.

409
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:46,968
Well, we--we picked
her up for vagrancy.

410
00:27:46,969 --> 00:27:48,503
Yes, sir.

411
00:27:48,504 --> 00:27:49,737
Yes, sir.

412
00:27:49,738 --> 00:27:51,472
I understand
that you're her stepfather.

413
00:27:51,473 --> 00:27:53,474
Yeah, yeah, I'm her step-father.

414
00:27:53,475 --> 00:27:54,742
Uh-huh.

415
00:27:54,743 --> 00:27:57,412
I married her mother
4 1/2 years ago.

416
00:27:57,413 --> 00:27:58,746
Terrible thing.

417
00:27:58,747 --> 00:27:59,999
She's been nothing
but a pain in my side.

418
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,449
She's been nothing
but a pain in my side.

419
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,750
She doesn't listen to me--

420
00:28:02,751 --> 00:28:04,452
Well, see,
it's required by the law

421
00:28:04,453 --> 00:28:05,453
that we notify you.

422
00:28:05,454 --> 00:28:07,488
Yeah, I'm glad you notified me.

423
00:28:07,489 --> 00:28:08,523
Keep her out there.

424
00:28:08,524 --> 00:28:09,624
She never listens to me.

425
00:28:09,625 --> 00:28:11,559
She never listened
to her mother.

426
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,329
It's like this kid's
got a mind of her own.

427
00:28:21,737 --> 00:28:23,871
Excuse me.

428
00:28:23,872 --> 00:28:25,473
Where's the women's room?

429
00:28:25,474 --> 00:28:27,775
Right next to the fire exit.

430
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,844
Thank you.

431
00:28:36,485 --> 00:28:37,685
Do me a favor.

432
00:28:37,686 --> 00:28:39,454
If she goes anywhere
or she takes any calls,

433
00:28:39,455 --> 00:28:40,588
you let me know?

434
00:28:40,589 --> 00:28:42,356
Don't worry about her.

435
00:28:42,357 --> 00:28:44,258
She'll be fine so long
as she doesn't run away

436
00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:45,360
like you used to.

437
00:28:47,996 --> 00:28:49,364
What are you gonna do?

438
00:29:04,913 --> 00:29:05,913
Roger, control, this is--

439
00:29:39,414 --> 00:29:40,782
I need it.

440
00:29:44,286 --> 00:29:45,521
I want it.

441
00:29:48,724 --> 00:29:49,992
I want it.

442
00:29:53,462 --> 00:29:55,230
I want it.

443
00:29:58,433 --> 00:29:59,635
Ooh, baby.

444
00:30:02,938 --> 00:30:05,673
Come on, baby.

445
00:30:05,674 --> 00:30:07,575
I think we should
get horizontal.

446
00:30:07,576 --> 00:30:09,777
I want it.

447
00:30:09,778 --> 00:30:11,947
I think we should
shed some skin.

448
00:30:14,216 --> 00:30:17,251
I can feel you beating faster

449
00:30:17,252 --> 00:30:19,687
and faster.

450
00:30:19,688 --> 00:30:21,957
Maybe now I'll let you in.

451
00:30:26,495 --> 00:30:27,829
I need it.

452
00:30:31,433 --> 00:30:33,235
Ooh, baby.

453
00:30:37,096 --> 00:30:39,430
I need it.

454
00:30:39,431 --> 00:30:42,533
She's quite a trophy, isn't she?

455
00:30:42,534 --> 00:30:44,635
I picked her up
off the streets of Chicago.

456
00:30:44,636 --> 00:30:48,473
I catch people like butterflies.

457
00:30:48,474 --> 00:30:50,375
Hi.

458
00:30:50,376 --> 00:30:52,377
I'm Roman.

459
00:30:52,378 --> 00:30:53,411
Kyle.

460
00:30:53,412 --> 00:30:55,646
Bradley.

461
00:30:55,647 --> 00:30:58,015
I'm looking for
my sister, merci cooper.

462
00:30:58,016 --> 00:30:59,999
She wrote me that she used
to sing here a while ago.

463
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,319
She wrote me that she used
to sing here a while ago.

464
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,421
Oh.

465
00:31:03,422 --> 00:31:06,158
Well, won't you have a seat,
Kyle?

466
00:31:18,437 --> 00:31:20,438
Now, while you're
hunting for your sister,

467
00:31:20,439 --> 00:31:23,141
I'm gonna try hunting you.

468
00:31:23,142 --> 00:31:25,510
I like to give women
a fair warning.

469
00:31:25,511 --> 00:31:28,312
Within 48 hours,
I'd say I'm gonna have you.

470
00:31:28,313 --> 00:31:29,999
You'll probably come to me.
If not, I'll find you.

471
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,416
You'll probably come to me.
If not, I'll find you.

472
00:31:31,417 --> 00:31:33,551
I'll catch you,

473
00:31:33,552 --> 00:31:34,719
mount you like a butterfly,

474
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,121
and then sell you
to a collector.

475
00:31:37,122 --> 00:31:39,590
I'll probably start
the hunt tonight.

476
00:31:39,591 --> 00:31:41,759
So you've got
a few hours' head start.

477
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,696
You really think
you're hot shit, don't you?

478
00:31:48,267 --> 00:31:51,235
Well,

479
00:31:51,236 --> 00:31:53,037
women remind me
of a kind of macaw

480
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:56,407
I've heard in the Amazon basin.

481
00:31:56,408 --> 00:31:58,643
They say it can screech
so loud it can kill itself.

482
00:31:58,644 --> 00:31:59,999
That's stretching it
a little bit,

483
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,245
that's stretching it
a little bit,

484
00:32:00,246 --> 00:32:02,747
don't you think, there, romy?

485
00:32:02,748 --> 00:32:04,749
I mean, the closest you ever
come to high adventure

486
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,350
was smuggling
a little dope and porno

487
00:32:06,351 --> 00:32:07,719
out of the back of a stolen van.

488
00:32:12,524 --> 00:32:15,660
Long time, no see, teff.

489
00:32:15,661 --> 00:32:18,629
She's underage, Romeo.

490
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:21,532
I thought you said
you didn't know anybody in L.A.

491
00:32:21,533 --> 00:32:24,268
You want to experience
the street life? Beat it.

492
00:32:24,269 --> 00:32:25,470
Why don't you go find
your sister

493
00:32:25,471 --> 00:32:26,751
and tell her
I'm looking for her.

494
00:32:32,311 --> 00:32:33,511
Sounds like you're
in a bad mood.

495
00:32:33,512 --> 00:32:35,347
Tommy sweeney's your bouncer.

496
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:38,749
Yeah.

497
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:42,386
He was killed last night.

498
00:32:42,387 --> 00:32:44,722
Oh, god.

499
00:32:44,723 --> 00:32:47,558
That's terrible.

500
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:49,727
I knew he was losing it.

501
00:32:49,728 --> 00:32:51,128
He started shooting up.

502
00:32:51,129 --> 00:32:53,498
That kid's sister was there.

503
00:32:53,499 --> 00:32:55,066
The motel Caribbean?

504
00:32:55,067 --> 00:32:56,434
Oh.

505
00:32:56,435 --> 00:32:58,002
Tommy liked rough stuff.

506
00:32:58,003 --> 00:32:59,504
S&m.

507
00:32:59,505 --> 00:33:00,000
He liked the tunnels of love.

508
00:33:00,001 --> 00:33:01,038
He liked the tunnels of love.

509
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,741
You still own that shit hole?

510
00:33:05,377 --> 00:33:07,078
So who's this chick
who killed Tommy?

511
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:08,379
Oh, no.

512
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:11,616
I don't think she did it.

513
00:33:11,617 --> 00:33:14,552
I think she saw it.

514
00:33:14,553 --> 00:33:15,586
Doesn't it make you tense

515
00:33:15,587 --> 00:33:16,754
always digging into the streets?

516
00:33:16,755 --> 00:33:18,189
You know, you're a little nuts.

517
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:21,559
What was Tommy
doing for you lately?

518
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,127
A little bodyguarding.

519
00:33:23,128 --> 00:33:25,396
What else do you know
about his sex habits?

520
00:33:25,397 --> 00:33:27,298
Oh, I think he liked
a little bit of everything.

521
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:29,500
Hey, you know, you've
got to start working out.

522
00:33:29,501 --> 00:33:30,000
Cut the shit, man.

523
00:33:30,001 --> 00:33:32,603
Cut the shit, man.

524
00:33:32,604 --> 00:33:36,707
If you're in the middle
of this, I'll know.

525
00:33:36,708 --> 00:33:39,477
Yeah, well, let me tell
you what I know, huh?

526
00:33:39,478 --> 00:33:41,078
I know two street kids

527
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:43,648
who used to shoplift
and shake down

528
00:33:43,649 --> 00:33:45,349
and eat and run
and dumpster dive

529
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,118
till we were old enough
to sell blood.

530
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:49,021
You remember those days,
teff, huh?

531
00:33:52,024 --> 00:33:55,293
I owed you one.

532
00:33:55,294 --> 00:33:57,229
I just paid you back
with a warning.

533
00:34:13,078 --> 00:34:15,179
Hi.

534
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,248
I dance too.

535
00:34:17,249 --> 00:34:19,017
I mean, amateur, but...

536
00:34:22,654 --> 00:34:25,656
Um,
I was just talking to the owner.

537
00:34:25,657 --> 00:34:27,592
Roman. Do you know him?

538
00:34:27,593 --> 00:34:29,093
I sleep with him.

539
00:34:29,094 --> 00:34:29,999
It's not the same thing.

540
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,295
It's not the same thing.

541
00:34:30,296 --> 00:34:32,163
Oh.

542
00:34:32,164 --> 00:34:35,566
I'm sorry. I--

543
00:34:35,567 --> 00:34:37,468
I just wondered
how I could get a job here.

544
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:40,271
Sleep with someone.

545
00:34:40,272 --> 00:34:43,107
Honey, Roman eats candy
like you every week.

546
00:34:43,108 --> 00:34:47,311
If you want to play with him,
you've got to have some backup.

547
00:34:47,312 --> 00:34:49,547
What's this I hear?

548
00:34:49,548 --> 00:34:51,048
I was just telling
your girlfriend

549
00:34:51,049 --> 00:34:54,619
to go back to her mall.

550
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,655
48 hours, remember.

551
00:35:03,595 --> 00:35:04,595
Hey, kels, do me a favor.

552
00:35:04,596 --> 00:35:06,430
Run a financial check
on Roman delphino.

553
00:35:06,431 --> 00:35:08,332
I need everything,
his taxes, his holdings,

554
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:09,333
the works, okay?

555
00:35:09,334 --> 00:35:10,702
I'll get back to you.

556
00:35:16,041 --> 00:35:17,576
Damn.

557
00:35:22,147 --> 00:35:25,349
Get that hooker merci in here.

558
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:26,484
Hey, man,

559
00:35:26,485 --> 00:35:28,786
you will not be hurting her.

560
00:35:28,787 --> 00:35:29,999
Not if like you said
she didn't see shit.

561
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,600
Not if like you said
she didn't see shit.

562
00:35:37,496 --> 00:35:39,063
Merci. Merci.

563
00:35:39,064 --> 00:35:40,698
You shouldn't be
out on the streets.

564
00:35:40,699 --> 00:35:43,100
You can't work dates now.

565
00:35:43,101 --> 00:35:46,103
How are you gonna
pay me my 20 bucks?

566
00:35:46,104 --> 00:35:47,605
Sparks.

567
00:35:47,606 --> 00:35:49,440
Sparks, you know,
this is karmic,

568
00:35:49,441 --> 00:35:51,308
because, you know,
I was just saying to someone

569
00:35:51,309 --> 00:35:54,378
that sparks Morris is the only
real gentleman on the boulevard.

570
00:35:54,379 --> 00:35:55,646
Do you remember
that Italian count

571
00:35:55,647 --> 00:35:57,381
that wanted me to headline
at his club?

572
00:35:57,382 --> 00:35:59,116
Sure, sure. What's not?

573
00:35:59,117 --> 00:35:59,999
Pardon me? What do you need?

574
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,080
Pardon me? What do you need?

575
00:36:03,622 --> 00:36:05,289
A place to stay.

576
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:07,725
Nonproblem.

577
00:36:07,726 --> 00:36:10,996
Honey,
you were meant to live in Rome.

578
00:36:41,226 --> 00:36:44,695
Checking my finances?

579
00:36:44,696 --> 00:36:47,132
Well, how deep
can a police sergeant dig?

580
00:36:52,704 --> 00:36:54,171
Yeah, okay, do that.

581
00:36:54,172 --> 00:36:55,307
Thanks.

582
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:04,181
You're in trouble, aren't you?

583
00:37:04,182 --> 00:37:05,316
I'm fine.

584
00:37:05,317 --> 00:37:07,151
Now I got to fucking
take it from you too?

585
00:37:07,152 --> 00:37:08,619
I was offering sympathy.

586
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:12,189
Jesus, Roman.

587
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:14,225
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

588
00:37:14,226 --> 00:37:17,161
I dress the way you want.

589
00:37:17,162 --> 00:37:18,662
I'm sorry. Come here, baby.

590
00:37:18,663 --> 00:37:19,697
Never mind.

591
00:37:19,698 --> 00:37:22,032
You kill the mood.

592
00:37:22,033 --> 00:37:26,003
You're always killing the mood.

593
00:37:26,004 --> 00:37:28,039
And your desk is a mess.

594
00:37:31,209 --> 00:37:35,179
Dr. Carlisle,
mark on line for you.

595
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,514
Hello, mark, you're on.

596
00:37:36,515 --> 00:37:38,082
Hello? Hello?

597
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:39,183
Yes.

598
00:37:39,184 --> 00:37:40,584
Is this Dr. Carlisle?

599
00:37:40,585 --> 00:37:41,619
Yes, this is Dr. Carlisle.

600
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,487
Hi, my name is--I'm nervous.

601
00:37:43,488 --> 00:37:44,655
That's all right.

602
00:37:44,656 --> 00:37:46,590
It's the first
time I've called in.

603
00:37:46,591 --> 00:37:50,162
Well--
Can I help you?

604
00:37:53,498 --> 00:37:55,733
Actually,

605
00:37:55,734 --> 00:37:59,999
do you need anybody to sweep up
or wash dishes, huh?

606
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,305
Do you need anybody to sweep up
or wash dishes, huh?

607
00:38:00,306 --> 00:38:01,505
How old are you?

608
00:38:01,506 --> 00:38:02,506
I'm 17.

609
00:38:02,507 --> 00:38:04,708
Go on. Get out of here.

610
00:38:04,709 --> 00:38:06,645
Okay.

611
00:38:29,301 --> 00:38:29,999
Remember, your address
has to be current.

612
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,600
Remember, your address
has to be current.

613
00:38:43,248 --> 00:38:45,216
Where'd that girl go?

614
00:38:45,217 --> 00:38:47,751
She took off that way.

615
00:38:47,752 --> 00:38:50,020
Fucking bum kids.

616
00:38:50,021 --> 00:38:51,755
All I got are skates.

617
00:38:51,756 --> 00:38:53,457
All I got are
her goddamn skates.

618
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:55,259
Everybody thinks
they're so fast.

619
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,994
Well, I'm faster than everybody.

620
00:38:56,995 --> 00:38:58,230
Watch this.

621
00:39:06,738 --> 00:39:08,673
That's fast.

622
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,944
Want some?

623
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:26,580
Don't ever offer
your food to anybody, okay?

624
00:39:26,581 --> 00:39:29,183
Don't be nice.

625
00:39:29,184 --> 00:39:29,999
Come here.

626
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,819
Come here.

627
00:39:36,525 --> 00:39:37,858
I'm a collector, you know?

628
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:40,861
I just enjoy getting
something for nothing.

629
00:39:40,862 --> 00:39:41,862
But I'm on probation,

630
00:39:41,863 --> 00:39:45,833
so you really
saved my ass back there.

631
00:39:45,834 --> 00:39:48,069
I won't forget it.

632
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:52,239
Anyway, you remind me
of me when I first got here.

633
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,875
I was raped twice.

634
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:58,379
You know, if you get desperate

635
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,847
and you need a place to hide,

636
00:39:59,848 --> 00:40:00,000
you go to the L.A. county
drug rehab center, all right?

637
00:40:00,001 --> 00:40:02,183
You go to the L.A. county
drug rehab center, all right?

638
00:40:02,184 --> 00:40:03,150
Remember that.

639
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:05,419
L.A. county drug rehab.

640
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,554
Okay?

641
00:40:06,555 --> 00:40:10,157
Free room and board,
tightest security.

642
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:12,326
What, like cops?

643
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:16,464
Like if some guy won't
leave you alone and he's armed.

644
00:40:16,465 --> 00:40:18,999
Oh, but they only take
smack addicts.

645
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,267
So what you do,
you get a needle,

646
00:40:20,268 --> 00:40:22,870
and you poke little holes
in your arm.

647
00:40:22,871 --> 00:40:26,140
You've done that?

648
00:40:26,141 --> 00:40:28,577
Honey, what the hell did
you think you'd find here?

649
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,949
I'm gonna be a dancer.

650
00:40:39,855 --> 00:40:40,955
All right, look.

651
00:40:40,956 --> 00:40:42,456
You want a job?

652
00:40:42,457 --> 00:40:44,391
Yeah. Of course. I mean, I--

653
00:40:44,392 --> 00:40:46,927
No, not of course.

654
00:40:46,928 --> 00:40:49,196
A job at minimum wage
won't get you off the boulevard.

655
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,532
You bust your ass all day,

656
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:53,100
eat a decent meal,

657
00:40:53,101 --> 00:40:54,870
then you go back to sleep
on the pavement.

658
00:40:57,539 --> 00:40:59,406
What are you doing?

659
00:40:59,407 --> 00:40:59,999
See these wires?

660
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,508
See these wires?

661
00:41:00,509 --> 00:41:02,043
Yeah.

662
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:11,018
That's what I'm doing.

663
00:41:11,019 --> 00:41:13,354
Is this your car? Yeah.

664
00:41:13,355 --> 00:41:16,557
Lost the keys last year.
Real pain in the ass.

665
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:17,792
Are you serious?

666
00:41:17,793 --> 00:41:19,827
Look, check this place out.

667
00:41:19,828 --> 00:41:22,129
Tell 'em pizza girl sent you.

668
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:25,966
I did a favor for the manager.

669
00:41:25,967 --> 00:41:29,069
Want a ride?

670
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:29,999
You're stealing this,
aren't you?

671
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,871
You're stealing this,
aren't you?

672
00:41:30,872 --> 00:41:32,072
You heard him.

673
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:34,975
He's got my wheels.

674
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:38,280
This is what I call
opening negotiations.

675
00:41:42,532 --> 00:41:44,568
Dancing foxes song-a-gram?

676
00:41:59,149 --> 00:41:59,999
Get the girl.

677
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,216
Get the girl.

678
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:01,817
Scare off teffler.

679
00:42:01,818 --> 00:42:03,619
Do it quietly.

680
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:04,787
You got that?

681
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:08,891
Girl, teffler, quietly.

682
00:42:08,892 --> 00:42:10,594
Get out of here.
I got work to do.

683
00:43:12,622 --> 00:43:15,158
Excuse me.

684
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:54,763
Hey.

685
00:43:54,764 --> 00:43:56,031
Do you want
to take something off,

686
00:43:56,032 --> 00:43:59,168
or you've got something we
haven't seen yet?

687
00:43:59,169 --> 00:43:59,999
I'm looking for merci.

688
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:00,769
I'm looking for merci.

689
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:01,770
Aren't we all?

690
00:44:01,771 --> 00:44:03,872
Merci cooper.

691
00:44:03,873 --> 00:44:06,009
It's been a while for you,
hasn't it?

692
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:34,670
Open up, open up.

693
00:44:34,671 --> 00:44:35,938
Can you smell that?

694
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:37,240
Excuse me.

695
00:44:45,148 --> 00:44:46,783
You little peckerhead.

696
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:56,225
Just having some fun.

697
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:57,259
Take a pill, dude.

698
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:58,927
Just let it go, okay?

699
00:44:58,928 --> 00:44:59,999
Hey, we paid for her, huh?

700
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,163
Hey, we paid for her, huh?

701
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:02,064
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

702
00:45:02,065 --> 00:45:04,167
The fuck do you think
you're doing with my wife?

703
00:45:06,536 --> 00:45:08,537
Excuse me.

704
00:45:08,538 --> 00:45:10,906
Excuse me.

705
00:45:10,907 --> 00:45:14,843
Let's go, dear.

706
00:45:14,844 --> 00:45:17,279
I forgot my clothes.

707
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,982
Could you please go get them--

708
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:21,683
No, no. No, no, no, no, no,

709
00:45:21,684 --> 00:45:22,684
I'm not going back in there.

710
00:45:22,685 --> 00:45:24,287
Those guys are pissed off
and plastered.

711
00:45:30,627 --> 00:45:31,927
I can't believe this.
You know what?

712
00:45:31,928 --> 00:45:34,163
I should arrest you
for your own good.

713
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:36,298
You've got a real
love-hate relationship

714
00:45:36,299 --> 00:45:39,668
with women, don't you?

715
00:45:39,669 --> 00:45:42,037
There's no love involved here.

716
00:45:42,038 --> 00:45:49,578
Then what are you doing here?

717
00:45:49,579 --> 00:45:51,647
I don't know.

718
00:45:51,648 --> 00:45:53,081
I'm looking for your sister.

719
00:45:53,082 --> 00:45:56,151
She used to work here.

720
00:45:56,152 --> 00:45:58,086
Listen, she's not wanted
for prostitution, okay?

721
00:45:58,087 --> 00:45:59,999
She's a suspect for murder.

722
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,723
She's a suspect for murder.

723
00:46:01,724 --> 00:46:02,991
Maybe she didn't do it.

724
00:46:02,992 --> 00:46:05,161
Maybe she was only a witness,
but she was at the scene.

725
00:46:08,898 --> 00:46:12,868
I'm sorry.
I don't make this stuff up.

726
00:46:12,869 --> 00:46:15,004
But if you know where she is,
you better tell me.

727
00:46:17,907 --> 00:46:21,276
Come on. Talk.

728
00:46:21,277 --> 00:46:26,015
I think it takes a sick kind
of mind to want to be a cop.

729
00:46:29,986 --> 00:46:30,000
You want to see sick, huh?

730
00:46:30,001 --> 00:46:31,754
You want to see sick, huh?

731
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:40,028
Out! Get out!

732
00:46:40,029 --> 00:46:41,029
This is Annie.

733
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:43,565
It's okay, Annie.

734
00:46:43,566 --> 00:46:45,234
She's a real professional.

735
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:47,002
How old do you think she is?

736
00:46:47,003 --> 00:46:48,538
All of 14?

737
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,008
Everybody out!

738
00:46:53,009 --> 00:46:54,309
Out! Everybody!

739
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:56,612
You against the wall.

740
00:46:56,613 --> 00:46:58,046
Meet your future blow job.

741
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,882
Think you're gonna
be different, huh?

742
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:00,000
Maybe gonna find a nice job
somewhere, Beverly hills.

743
00:47:00,001 --> 00:47:02,851
Maybe gonna find a nice job
somewhere, Beverly hills.

744
00:47:02,852 --> 00:47:04,853
Sansell's from Malibu.

745
00:47:04,854 --> 00:47:05,787
Let's see those arms.

746
00:47:05,788 --> 00:47:07,856
Come here.

747
00:47:07,857 --> 00:47:09,191
I'm clean.

748
00:47:09,192 --> 00:47:11,193
Okay, the shoes,
take off the shoes.

749
00:47:11,194 --> 00:47:13,195
I want to see your feet.
Take off the shoes.

750
00:47:13,196 --> 00:47:15,831
Okay.

751
00:47:15,832 --> 00:47:18,934
I'm gonna be sick.

752
00:47:18,935 --> 00:47:21,270
You say that again,

753
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:23,206
because that's exactly
what I did.

754
00:48:06,983 --> 00:48:10,986
Oh, come on,
you're distracting me.

755
00:48:10,987 --> 00:48:13,089
I got a business
to run here, you know?

756
00:48:41,784 --> 00:48:43,285
You know, just give me
one more day, Roman.

757
00:48:43,286 --> 00:48:44,853
I'm gonna get this squared away.

758
00:48:44,854 --> 00:48:45,989
Hey.

759
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,999
Sister say no.

760
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:00,936
Sister say no.

761
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:03,271
See this badge?

762
00:49:03,272 --> 00:49:04,873
This means
you have to open the gate.

763
00:49:04,874 --> 00:49:07,209
Sister say no beds.

764
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:08,877
Great.

765
00:49:08,878 --> 00:49:11,546
Could you just tell the sister
it's for--for one night?

766
00:49:11,547 --> 00:49:13,582
We just need one bed
for one night.

767
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:14,883
That's it.

768
00:49:14,884 --> 00:49:16,019
Thank you.

769
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:23,025
Thank you.

770
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:26,194
I think it's impressive.

771
00:49:26,195 --> 00:49:28,930
Yeah.

772
00:49:28,931 --> 00:49:29,999
Let's go.

773
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:30,600
Let's go.

774
00:49:35,171 --> 00:49:37,139
Kyle, listen, I'm sorry. No.

775
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:40,175
Okay? It's the only bed in town.

776
00:49:40,176 --> 00:49:43,011
She just died now,
right now in the same--

777
00:49:43,012 --> 00:49:44,012
In the same bed?

778
00:49:44,013 --> 00:49:45,047
Not just now.

779
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:46,314
Kyle, listen, it's--I'm sorry.

780
00:49:46,315 --> 00:49:48,683
You're telling me that--

781
00:49:48,684 --> 00:49:50,786
Listen,
would you just do this for me?

782
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:54,022
I mean, we've been
driving around for hours.

783
00:49:54,023 --> 00:49:56,024
Please.

784
00:49:56,025 --> 00:49:57,693
Oh, my god.

785
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:02,931
Listen, when I find your
sister, we'll come back,

786
00:50:02,932 --> 00:50:04,299
and we'll pull you
out of the place.

787
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:06,535
I promise.

788
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:07,769
But just do me a favor, okay?

789
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:09,172
The house mother's waiting.

790
00:50:13,709 --> 00:50:16,611
Thanks.

791
00:50:16,612 --> 00:50:18,314
Just behave yourself.

792
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:16,672
Don't bother.

793
00:51:31,554 --> 00:51:35,023
This is your place?

794
00:51:35,024 --> 00:51:37,260
Hey, really,
I feel safer on the street.

795
00:51:45,935 --> 00:51:48,603
Condemned look.

796
00:51:48,604 --> 00:51:49,838
I like it.

797
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:51,973
You're very funny.

798
00:51:51,974 --> 00:51:53,074
You're funny.

799
00:51:53,075 --> 00:51:55,544
Would you like some
milk and cookies?

800
00:51:55,545 --> 00:51:56,846
The hamburger was enough.

801
00:52:00,583 --> 00:52:02,083
Are you sure
you're not still hungry?

802
00:52:02,084 --> 00:52:03,018
I'm sure.

803
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:05,887
Okay.

804
00:52:05,888 --> 00:52:08,623
Hey, you got a message.

805
00:52:08,624 --> 00:52:09,825
Can I listen?

806
00:52:13,129 --> 00:52:15,096
Uh, detective sergeant teffler,

807
00:52:15,097 --> 00:52:18,099
this is lorenzo fiero,
captain woods' brother-in-law.

808
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:19,601
I believe he mentioned me
to you.

809
00:52:19,602 --> 00:52:21,169
Look, I've been trying
to get ahold of you

810
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:22,304
about your house.

811
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:26,708
Could you please give me
a call at 555-4929?

812
00:52:26,709 --> 00:52:29,211
Mr. teffler, this is
shelby tuttle once again.

813
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:29,999
We have a buyer
willing to offer you $500,000

814
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,646
we have a buyer
willing to offer you $500,000

815
00:52:31,647 --> 00:52:33,148
for your house cash.

816
00:52:33,149 --> 00:52:35,283
Hey, you're gonna stay here,

817
00:52:35,284 --> 00:52:38,787
you got to learn
something first.

818
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:40,589
No shit.

819
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:43,159
Like just how weird
you really are?

820
00:52:46,357 --> 00:52:48,726
What, just because I'm
gonna turn down $1/2 million?

821
00:53:01,639 --> 00:53:03,706
You like that.

822
00:53:03,707 --> 00:53:06,376
Get out of here.

823
00:53:06,377 --> 00:53:08,278
What do you mean,
"hard to find?" She's a hooker.

824
00:53:08,279 --> 00:53:10,681
Me asked all over town, man.

825
00:53:13,517 --> 00:53:15,185
I don't like this.

826
00:53:15,186 --> 00:53:18,621
Why is she hiding out
if she's got nothing to hide?

827
00:53:18,622 --> 00:53:20,291
Just fucking find her, okay?

828
00:53:28,732 --> 00:53:29,999
Hey, teff, do you have a towel?

829
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,268
Hey, teff, do you have a towel?

830
00:53:35,673 --> 00:53:37,107
Towel.

831
00:53:51,121 --> 00:53:52,423
Towel's right out here.

832
00:54:15,813 --> 00:54:17,313
I already called
the halfway house.

833
00:54:17,314 --> 00:54:20,583
You guys are my last resort.

834
00:54:20,584 --> 00:54:22,585
Well, could she maybe just,
I don't know,

835
00:54:22,586 --> 00:54:24,822
share a room with somebody
for the evening?

836
00:54:27,591 --> 00:54:29,726
Okay.

837
00:54:29,727 --> 00:54:30,000
Okay. Thank you.

838
00:54:30,001 --> 00:54:33,196
Okay. Thank you.

839
00:54:33,197 --> 00:54:35,198
Jesus.

840
00:54:35,199 --> 00:54:37,567
Hey.

841
00:54:37,568 --> 00:54:39,302
Look, I'm sorry. Look, I'll go--

842
00:54:39,303 --> 00:54:41,838
No, no, I--I mean,
you got--I apologize.

843
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:43,106
You're a handful.

844
00:54:43,107 --> 00:54:45,441
You're a firecracker.

845
00:54:45,442 --> 00:54:46,876
Yeah.

846
00:54:46,877 --> 00:54:48,811
That's what my stepdad said
last week

847
00:54:48,812 --> 00:54:50,647
when I moved in with him.

848
00:54:50,648 --> 00:54:53,349
I got out of there right quick.

849
00:54:53,350 --> 00:54:54,351
What do you mean?

850
00:54:57,221 --> 00:54:58,589
What do you mean?

851
00:55:03,093 --> 00:55:05,229
Listen, could you just
cut out the strip tease act?

852
00:55:07,331 --> 00:55:08,598
That's it. Please.

853
00:55:08,599 --> 00:55:10,333
Thanks a lot. Good-bye.

854
00:55:10,334 --> 00:55:11,701
Good-bye? Where are you going?

855
00:55:11,702 --> 00:55:14,203
What, are you gonna go sleep
in a gutter somewhere, huh?

856
00:55:14,204 --> 00:55:15,405
Well, you don't have anything.

857
00:55:15,406 --> 00:55:17,206
You don't even have
the clothes on your back.

858
00:55:17,207 --> 00:55:18,675
Then take the fucking
clothes on my back.

859
00:55:18,676 --> 00:55:20,643
I don't need anything from you.
You want them.

860
00:55:20,644 --> 00:55:21,644
I don't need it.

861
00:55:21,645 --> 00:55:23,347
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

862
00:55:58,456 --> 00:55:59,999
Come on, baby.

863
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,191
Come on, baby.

864
00:56:01,192 --> 00:56:03,527
I think we should
get horizontal.

865
00:56:03,528 --> 00:56:05,262
I want it.

866
00:56:05,263 --> 00:56:09,633
I think we should
shed some skin.

867
00:56:09,634 --> 00:56:15,172
I can feel you beating
faster and faster.

868
00:56:15,173 --> 00:56:18,008
Maybe now I'll let you in.

869
00:56:18,009 --> 00:56:20,677
Duane Winchester.

870
00:56:20,678 --> 00:56:23,614
He's a biochemist.

871
00:56:23,615 --> 00:56:29,286
He lost his wife and
his only son in a car accident.

872
00:56:29,287 --> 00:56:29,999
Basically went around
with a permanent broken heart.

873
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,389
Basically went around
with a permanent broken heart.

874
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:35,659
He picked me up. I was starving.

875
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:39,129
He treated me like a son.

876
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:40,230
Pretty much the closest thing

877
00:56:40,231 --> 00:56:44,034
I've known to having a father.

878
00:56:44,035 --> 00:56:47,538
This is the closest thing
I've known to having a home.

879
00:56:52,277 --> 00:56:54,311
Teff,

880
00:56:54,312 --> 00:56:59,050
am I just, like,
your social work for this week?

881
00:57:13,097 --> 00:57:14,731
You can try some
of the old lady's clothes on

882
00:57:14,732 --> 00:57:17,302
in the closet, but you got
to sleep on the couch.

883
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:00,000
No!

884
00:58:00,001 --> 00:58:01,179
No!

885
00:58:09,354 --> 00:58:11,455
Kyle.

886
00:58:11,456 --> 00:58:12,389
Kyle, hey.

887
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:14,024
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

888
00:58:14,025 --> 00:58:15,192
It's okay.

889
00:58:15,193 --> 00:58:16,226
You're having a dream.

890
00:58:16,227 --> 00:58:17,995
It's okay.

891
00:58:17,996 --> 00:58:18,762
You're okay here.

892
00:58:18,763 --> 00:58:22,299
Come here.

893
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,068
It's okay.

894
00:58:28,473 --> 00:58:29,999
You had a bad dream there.

895
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,242
You had a bad dream there.

896
00:58:32,243 --> 00:58:33,344
You're all right.

897
00:58:36,481 --> 00:58:36,981
Wow.

898
00:58:40,651 --> 00:58:44,087
I wish you were
another year older.

899
00:58:44,088 --> 00:58:45,523
Would a year
make such a difference?

900
00:58:48,126 --> 00:58:49,259
You're gonna be different.

901
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:51,328
In another year, you're
gonna be a different girl.

902
00:58:51,329 --> 00:58:52,630
In another year,
I'll be a woman.

903
00:59:00,238 --> 00:59:02,240
You'll be even
more scared of me.

904
00:59:04,709 --> 00:59:08,645
Come on, hey. Hey.

905
00:59:08,646 --> 00:59:10,013
Kyle, come on.

906
00:59:10,014 --> 00:59:11,494
I know what
you're going through here.

907
00:59:32,285 --> 00:59:36,755
King 26, talk to me.

908
00:59:36,756 --> 00:59:38,290
Control, this is baywatch 26.

909
00:59:38,291 --> 00:59:40,725
I have made visual contact.

910
00:59:40,726 --> 00:59:42,194
What is she doing now?

911
00:59:42,195 --> 00:59:44,729
Looks like she's gonna
be crossing Hollywood boulevard,

912
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:47,233
and right now, she's bumming
change from some guy.

913
00:59:57,558 --> 00:59:59,259
Do you have any idea
how many unwritten laws

914
00:59:59,260 --> 00:59:59,999
you've broken this week?

915
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,828
You've broken this week?

916
01:00:01,829 --> 01:00:05,799
Now,
I know it's your private life.

917
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:08,535
But if you've
harbored a witness,

918
01:00:08,536 --> 01:00:12,005
it could blow
a whole felony case.

919
01:00:12,006 --> 01:00:14,041
Don't take the bullet on
personally, teff.

920
01:00:46,974 --> 01:00:48,075
Ah, shit.

921
01:03:11,152 --> 01:03:12,786
Did she eat something?

922
01:03:12,787 --> 01:03:15,255
Yes. She's washed up.

923
01:03:15,256 --> 01:03:17,258
That's pretty good
for a bag lady.

924
01:03:20,795 --> 01:03:23,530
I want to dance.

925
01:03:23,531 --> 01:03:26,800
Professionally.

926
01:03:26,801 --> 01:03:28,201
I could give you that.

927
01:03:28,202 --> 01:03:29,999
I want a contract,
and I want a down payment.

928
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,639
I want a contract,
and I want a down payment.

929
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:35,008
Jeez, what,
you got an agent already?

930
01:03:35,009 --> 01:03:36,976
And I don't want to get screwed

931
01:03:36,977 --> 01:03:39,613
like you screwed my sister.

932
01:03:43,818 --> 01:03:45,718
Did you ever find her?

933
01:03:45,719 --> 01:03:49,155
Yeah, I found out a lot--

934
01:03:49,156 --> 01:03:51,225
A lot I could tell
my friend, the cop.

935
01:03:54,895 --> 01:03:56,996
You think
I'm some silly little girl?

936
01:03:56,997 --> 01:03:59,532
You think I haven't seen the
14-year-old pros shooting up

937
01:03:59,533 --> 01:04:00,000
or the Johns driving in
from Malibu for a blow job?

938
01:04:00,001 --> 01:04:02,102
Or the Johns driving in
from Malibu for a blow job?

939
01:04:04,839 --> 01:04:08,007
I underestimated you.

940
01:04:08,008 --> 01:04:09,577
So?

941
01:04:12,947 --> 01:04:14,849
Do we open negotiations?

942
01:04:17,017 --> 01:04:18,751
Sure.

943
01:04:18,752 --> 01:04:20,154
Why not?

944
01:04:24,825 --> 01:04:26,527
Sure. Why not?

945
01:04:28,963 --> 01:04:29,999
Tell you what.

946
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:30,763
Tell you what.

947
01:04:30,764 --> 01:04:32,032
Why don't you go first?

948
01:04:35,002 --> 01:04:38,571
Hmm? Why don't you start?

949
01:04:38,572 --> 01:04:41,041
You know, you are quite
a catch, you know that?

950
01:04:43,944 --> 01:04:45,512
You're full of shit.

951
01:04:52,887 --> 01:04:56,756
You know, I've always loved
a woman who could piss me off,

952
01:04:56,757 --> 01:04:58,926
'cause then I know
I'm not taking advantage of her.

953
01:05:19,813 --> 01:05:21,181
She's going home now.

954
01:05:25,085 --> 01:05:27,221
Would you please go away?

955
01:05:30,858 --> 01:05:32,659
That gun's a big mistake.

956
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:34,093
I'm gonna sting your ass.

957
01:05:34,094 --> 01:05:36,062
I'm gonna give you just
enough rope to hang yourself,

958
01:05:36,063 --> 01:05:38,232
and then I'm gonna
put you away for life.

959
01:05:43,504 --> 01:05:44,971
You want to know
why you hate me so much?

960
01:05:44,972 --> 01:05:45,973
Yeah, I do.

961
01:06:05,859 --> 01:06:07,661
Let go of me!

962
01:06:18,233 --> 01:06:20,501
Who the fuck tipped him off,
huh?

963
01:06:20,502 --> 01:06:21,802
No, I swear.

964
01:06:21,803 --> 01:06:23,038
I swear.

965
01:06:36,752 --> 01:06:38,753
What did he shoot you with, huh?

966
01:06:38,754 --> 01:06:40,354
I am fine.

967
01:06:40,355 --> 01:06:42,290
Did he have a name for it?
What did he call it, huh?

968
01:06:42,291 --> 01:06:43,424
I'm fine. He give it a name?

969
01:06:43,425 --> 01:06:44,692
Would you quit
trying to save me?

970
01:06:44,693 --> 01:06:46,227
Come on.
Let's go to the hospital.

971
01:06:46,228 --> 01:06:47,461
You're the one who's bleeding.

972
01:06:47,462 --> 01:06:48,797
Come on, let's go.
Get in the car.

973
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,068
Son of a bitch.

974
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:13,721
Girl, we've been
looking for you.

975
01:07:13,722 --> 01:07:17,058
Mikey, darling, I am hurt.

976
01:07:17,059 --> 01:07:20,094
I want you to know
I am seriously offended.

977
01:07:20,095 --> 01:07:21,429
What you talking under?

978
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:24,098
I trusted you.

979
01:07:24,099 --> 01:07:26,067
And you--you haven't
given me a chance to sing,

980
01:07:26,068 --> 01:07:28,402
and now you've put me
in a very bad position

981
01:07:28,403 --> 01:07:29,999
with the police.

982
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:30,072
With the police.

983
01:07:30,073 --> 01:07:31,339
You come inside.

984
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:32,607
Me get you a drink.

985
01:07:32,608 --> 01:07:34,342
Me make it all better, huh?

986
01:07:34,343 --> 01:07:37,545
I'm not going anywhere with you.

987
01:07:37,546 --> 01:07:39,680
I want you to honor
our friendship.

988
01:07:39,681 --> 01:07:43,517
Me do everything me can.

989
01:07:43,518 --> 01:07:44,819
You come inside.

990
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:46,454
No, listen.

991
01:07:46,455 --> 01:07:48,589
I have to leave for Paris.

992
01:07:48,590 --> 01:07:51,525
There's a photographer there
who offered to pay my way.

993
01:07:51,526 --> 01:07:52,793
However--
Please. Jah.

994
01:07:52,794 --> 01:07:55,763
Look, me loan you money.

995
01:07:55,764 --> 01:07:58,399
You just come inside
with me now.

996
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,734
No.

997
01:07:59,735 --> 01:08:00,000
I'm on the run, damn it.

998
01:08:00,001 --> 01:08:03,437
I'm on the run, damn it.

999
01:08:03,438 --> 01:08:05,606
I would appreciate a loan.

1000
01:08:05,607 --> 01:08:07,142
Thank you.

1001
01:08:11,179 --> 01:08:14,582
What were you doing
with that asshole?

1002
01:08:14,583 --> 01:08:16,150
I don't know.

1003
01:08:16,151 --> 01:08:19,553
I guess I'm just a little
too young to know any better.

1004
01:08:19,554 --> 01:08:23,090
You're old enough
to know better.

1005
01:08:23,091 --> 01:08:25,093
Am I?

1006
01:08:29,631 --> 01:08:30,000
You know, by the way,

1007
01:08:30,001 --> 01:08:31,098
you know, by the way,

1008
01:08:31,099 --> 01:08:33,300
I don't have this love-hate
relationship with women.

1009
01:08:33,301 --> 01:08:34,635
Of course you don't.

1010
01:08:34,636 --> 01:08:36,771
I mean, I may hate
some of the things they do,

1011
01:08:36,772 --> 01:08:38,607
but I don't--
I don't hate them.

1012
01:08:41,076 --> 01:08:42,344
I know.

1013
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:50,685
You know, if you didn't
keep running away from me,

1014
01:08:50,686 --> 01:08:54,455
I wouldn't have
to keep saving you.

1015
01:08:54,456 --> 01:08:55,623
Yeah.

1016
01:08:55,624 --> 01:08:56,657
I really hate it when people

1017
01:08:56,658 --> 01:08:59,094
keep running away from things.

1018
01:09:04,599 --> 01:09:07,535
On your mark...

1019
01:09:07,536 --> 01:09:09,571
Get set...

1020
01:12:07,549 --> 01:12:09,617
Sweet, sweet.

1021
01:12:09,618 --> 01:12:11,386
Sweet.

1022
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:42,014
Me late.

1023
01:12:42,015 --> 01:12:44,517
Late, late, late.

1024
01:12:44,518 --> 01:12:45,885
I don't know why I hang out

1025
01:12:45,886 --> 01:12:48,489
with such an unsavory character
as you.

1026
01:12:51,859 --> 01:12:53,259
The men who killed Tommy sweeney

1027
01:12:53,260 --> 01:12:57,230
are probably out to kill me now,

1028
01:12:57,231 --> 01:12:59,999
the police are ready
to arrest me,

1029
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:00,900
the police are ready
to arrest me,

1030
01:13:00,901 --> 01:13:04,070
I am totally without funds,

1031
01:13:04,071 --> 01:13:06,038
and I must flee
for my life tonight

1032
01:13:06,039 --> 01:13:08,908
under the cover of darkness.

1033
01:13:08,909 --> 01:13:11,477
Or you could sing a set.

1034
01:13:11,478 --> 01:13:15,248
Some record people
will be there.

1035
01:13:15,249 --> 01:13:16,283
Hmm?

1036
01:13:19,553 --> 01:13:21,321
Hmm.

1037
01:13:27,895 --> 01:13:29,061
This is Lee teffler.

1038
01:13:29,062 --> 01:13:29,999
I'm not in to get your call,
so leave a message.

1039
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,063
I'm not in to get your call,
so leave a message.

1040
01:13:31,064 --> 01:13:33,332
One king 89, come in, please.

1041
01:13:33,333 --> 01:13:36,035
Hey, teff, it's me, kelso.

1042
01:13:36,036 --> 01:13:37,303
Come on, answer.

1043
01:13:37,304 --> 01:13:38,404
I got something for you.

1044
01:13:38,405 --> 01:13:39,939
It's about
the Tommy sweeney case.

1045
01:13:39,940 --> 01:13:41,140
Hey, kels, what's happening?

1046
01:13:41,141 --> 01:13:42,942
Hey, that pimp you know, sparks?

1047
01:13:42,943 --> 01:13:44,644
Well, it turns out he's been
charged in the past

1048
01:13:44,645 --> 01:13:46,078
for kidnapping.

1049
01:13:46,079 --> 01:13:48,581
Seems like some of his
street girls have disappeared.

1050
01:13:48,582 --> 01:13:50,449
This may be the guy we're after.

1051
01:13:50,450 --> 01:13:53,052
No, no, no,
that doesn't make sense.

1052
01:13:53,053 --> 01:13:54,487
Why would the guy cut off
his own income

1053
01:13:54,488 --> 01:13:56,522
and then come into the station
to complain about it?

1054
01:13:56,523 --> 01:13:58,057
Hey, I just report the facts.

1055
01:13:58,058 --> 01:13:59,426
You figure it out. Teff!

1056
01:14:02,196 --> 01:14:03,196
Kyle?

1057
01:14:03,197 --> 01:14:04,197
Teff?

1058
01:14:04,198 --> 01:14:06,166
Teff, you there?

1059
01:15:06,126 --> 01:15:08,427
Let go!

1060
01:15:08,428 --> 01:15:10,230

01:23:38,050 --> 01:23:39,050
But it was stupid.

1160
01:23:39,051 --> 01:23:41,553
I thought it was
a birthday joke.

1161
01:23:41,554 --> 01:23:43,289

1162
01:23:46,458 --> 01:23:47,492

1163
01:23:47,493 --> 01:23:50,962

1164
01:23:50,963 --> 01:23:51,963

1165
01:23:51,964 --> 01:23:53,932

01:23:53,933 --> 01:23:54,933

Merci, no.

Let's go.

Go, go, go!

1185
01:24:50,556 --> 01:24:52,591
Hey, get out of the way!

1186
01:25:56,689 --> 01:25:58,524

1187
01:26:01,550 --> 01:26:03,785
No.

1188
01:26:03,786 --> 01:26:06,321
I got to go.

1189
01:26:06,322 --> 01:26:09,457
You wait here a couple
of minutes and then take off.

1190
01:26:09,458 --> 01:26:12,393
I'll meet you
at the bus station.

1191
01:26:12,394 --> 01:26:14,629
Don't.

1192
01:26:14,630 --> 01:26:18,199
You'll be okay.

1193
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:21,836

take care of yourself.

doesn't it?

1195
01:26:34,350 --> 01:26:35,651
Hey.

1196
01:27:26,635 --> 01:27:29,304
Don't even think about it.

1197
01:27:29,305 --> 01:27:29,999
You got your warrant.

1198
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,539
You got your warrant.

1199
01:27:31,540 --> 01:27:34,809

out there.

1200
01:27:34,810 --> 01:27:36,077
Hey.

1201
01:27:36,078 --> 01:27:37,812
How much more do you want?

1202
01:27:37,813 --> 01:27:39,714
They're shipping
a girl out tonight, kelso.

1203
01:27:39,715 --> 01:27:41,149
I've been in his office.

1204
01:27:41,150 --> 01:27:43,151
You got to arrest him first.

1205
01:27:43,152 --> 01:27:44,719
I'm gonna catch him in the act.

1206
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:46,721
We're gonna make it
stick this time.

1207
01:27:46,722 --> 01:27:48,389
Shut up.

1208
01:27:48,390 --> 01:27:49,791
You don't want the captain
to hear you.

1209
01:27:49,792 --> 01:27:50,792
No, we nail him,

1210
01:27:50,793 --> 01:27:53,828
and we put this guy away
for life.

1211
01:27:53,829 --> 01:27:55,630
No, no, no.

1212
01:27:55,631 --> 01:27:56,798
Kels.

1213
01:27:56,799 --> 01:27:58,199

1214
01:27:58,200 --> 01:27:59,999
Man, you're putting
lives at stake.

1215
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:00,702
Man, you're putting
lives at stake.

1216
01:28:00,703 --> 01:28:02,771
Don't you want to get
away from your desk?

1217
01:28:05,213 --> 01:28:08,482
Teff, I'm not an action person.

1218
01:28:08,483 --> 01:28:10,885
I am sorry,
because you're going.

1219
01:28:10,886 --> 01:28:14,021
I got to have somebody there
I can trust.

1220
01:28:14,022 --> 01:28:16,357
You think about
your daughter, man.

1221
01:28:16,358 --> 01:28:18,193
He's got girls just like her
on the street.

1222
01:28:22,364 --> 01:28:24,499
Except there's a certain one
I got to protect first.

1223
01:28:37,212 --> 01:28:38,413
Hey.

1224
01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:43,284
Hi.

1225
01:28:43,285 --> 01:28:44,885

1227
01:28:50,859 --> 01:28:52,127
Here you go.

1228
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,900
This just doesn't
seem right to me.

1229
01:28:59,901 --> 01:29:00,000
This is absolutely right.

1230
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:01,235
This is absolutely right.

1231
01:29:01,236 --> 01:29:04,038
You'll be safe.

1232
01:29:04,039 --> 01:29:05,306
I feel like I'm deserting her.

1233
01:29:05,307 --> 01:29:09,011
I'm--I'm deserting you.

I got to get out of here.

1239
01:30:08,336 --> 01:30:11,172
You're staying.

1240
01:30:11,173 --> 01:30:12,440
You're in on this.

1241
01:30:12,441 --> 01:30:14,442
What?

1242
01:30:14,443 --> 01:30:16,544
Kels, give me a break.

1243
01:30:16,545 --> 01:30:18,145
Roman's got
some inside information.

1244
01:30:18,146 --> 01:30:19,814
He's got police records,
police files.

1245
01:30:19,815 --> 01:30:23,350
I know it's you.

1246
01:30:23,351 --> 01:30:26,120
Hey.

1247
01:30:26,121 --> 01:30:28,055
If you knew how long
I wanted out of this--

1248
01:30:28,056 --> 01:30:29,523
Yeah, everybody wants out, pal.

1249
01:30:29,524 --> 01:30:30,000
You don't. You love it.

1250
01:30:30,001 --> 01:30:31,892
You don't. You love it.

1251
01:30:31,893 --> 01:30:33,961
All it ever did
was make me more in debt.

1252
01:30:33,962 --> 01:30:35,763
Then why didn't you
get another goddamn job?

1253
01:30:35,764 --> 01:30:36,831
I did.

1254
01:30:36,832 --> 01:30:38,199
Working for this piece of shit?

1255
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:39,366
You got a wife.

1256
01:30:39,367 --> 01:30:41,001
You got a daughter.

1257
01:30:41,002 --> 01:30:42,870
Hey, don't give me that shit.

1258
01:30:42,871 --> 01:30:45,172
You got a girlfriend,
and she's underage.

1259
01:30:45,173 --> 01:30:46,373
You know what they're gonna do

1260
01:30:46,374 --> 01:30:47,975
when they found out
about you downtown?

1261
01:30:47,976 --> 01:30:49,376
Nothing.

1262
01:30:49,377 --> 01:30:51,378
'Cause cops don't lose
their badge over this shit.

1263
01:30:51,379 --> 01:30:53,148
They lose their badge
over shit like this.

1264
01:31:13,068 --> 01:31:14,502
Come on. Come on.

1265
01:31:14,503 --> 01:31:16,337
Teff!

1266
01:31:16,338 --> 01:31:21,142
I know you're out there!

1267
01:31:21,143 --> 01:31:22,143
That's Kyle.

1268
01:31:22,144 --> 01:31:23,277
Oh, shit.

1269
01:31:23,278 --> 01:31:24,879
You knew about this,
you son of a bitch?

1270
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:26,213
No, I didn't. I swear I didn't.

1271
01:31:26,214 --> 01:31:28,249
Teff, I told you you'd be
putting lives on the line.

1272
01:31:28,250 --> 01:31:29,999
Not this life.

1273
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:30,118
Not this life.

1274
01:31:30,119 --> 01:31:31,552
You think
if I start fucking with you,

1275
01:31:31,553 --> 01:31:34,021
he'll come out in the open, huh?

1276
01:31:34,022 --> 01:31:36,123
Scream.

1277
01:31:36,124 --> 01:31:38,159
Scream!

1278
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:39,326
Scream.

1279
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:40,327
Go to hell.

1280
01:31:40,328 --> 01:31:41,763
Scream!

1281
01:31:53,942 --> 01:31:55,877
Get your men back on the boat.

1282
01:32:01,416 --> 01:32:03,384
I'm sorry.

1283
01:32:03,385 --> 01:32:05,119
I'm sorry.

1284
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:06,787
Teff!

1285
01:32:06,788 --> 01:32:07,788
Get moving.

1286
01:32:07,789 --> 01:32:09,024
Move it!

1287
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:13,861
Go.

1288
01:32:13,862 --> 01:32:15,329
Go.

1289
01:32:15,330 --> 01:32:16,264
Go.

1290
01:32:22,337 --> 01:32:24,439
Do it right,
or I'll do it myself.

1291
01:33:00,375 --> 01:33:03,245
Come on, you fucking punk cop!

1292
01:33:06,481 --> 01:33:08,950
That was the sound
of my man's gun.

1293
01:33:15,423 --> 01:33:17,558
My man again.

1294
01:33:17,559 --> 01:33:19,394
Something tells me
you'll be leaving soon.

1295
01:34:22,290 --> 01:34:23,858
Hey!

1296
01:34:29,297 --> 01:34:29,999
Hey!

1297
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:30,899
Hey!

1298
01:34:41,509 --> 01:34:42,910
Carlo!

1299
01:34:42,911 --> 01:34:44,212
Is it over?

1300
01:34:53,922 --> 01:34:55,990
Shit.

1301
01:34:55,991 --> 01:34:58,092
It's over.

1302
01:34:58,093 --> 01:34:59,427
Let her go.

1303
01:35:06,725 --> 01:35:09,193
Want to trade?

1304
01:35:09,194 --> 01:35:11,662
Trade what?

1305
01:35:11,663 --> 01:35:13,330
Information.

1306
01:35:13,331 --> 01:35:16,967
What you know, who else knows,
what's your cost.

1307
01:35:16,968 --> 01:35:20,004
Come on, teff,
everybody's got their price.

1308
01:35:20,005 --> 01:35:21,272
Put it down first.

1309
01:35:21,273 --> 01:35:23,308
You first.

1310
01:35:25,977 --> 01:35:28,012
You're a psychopath.

1311
01:35:28,013 --> 01:35:29,914
Then don't take me
personally, huh?

1312
01:35:29,915 --> 01:35:30,000
Then fuck her!

1313
01:35:30,001 --> 01:35:31,715
Then fuck her!

1314
01:35:31,716 --> 01:35:33,251
Okay!

1315
01:35:43,562 --> 01:35:44,963
No!

1316
01:37:09,848 --> 01:37:11,249
Are you okay?

1317
01:37:16,087 --> 01:37:17,856
I thought we were finished.

1318
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:23,795
So did I.

1319
01:37:44,355 --> 01:37:45,523
Let's go.
