2
00:00:34,296 --> 00:00:36,025
Hang on there, Clyde!

3
00:00:36,432 --> 00:00:38,028
Sorry, miss, we're closed.

4
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,703
Just look at what I'm selling!
You'll plotz!

5
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,009
Good work, Harley girl.

6
00:00:58,087 --> 00:01:02,387
Now, what would be a suitable trade
for our joke in the box?

7
00:01:15,337 --> 00:01:17,576
For some reason,
this just speaks to me.

8
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:18,977
What do you think, Harl?

9
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:21,005
It's you, puddin'!

10
00:01:32,821 --> 00:01:35,346
Awfully nice
doing business with you.

11
00:01:35,491 --> 00:01:36,480
Thanks.

12
00:01:37,559 --> 00:01:38,992
What a pleasant fellow.

13
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:50,337
It's weird. All this junk and the Joker
only takes one lousy statue.

14
00:01:50,773 --> 00:01:54,436
Especially since we've heard on the streets
he's desperate for cash these days.

15
00:01:54,676 --> 00:01:57,509
Things are never what they seem
with the Joker.

16
00:01:59,515 --> 00:02:02,040
I guess the night
brings out all the wackos.

17
00:02:09,658 --> 00:02:12,525
It was made of jade,
worth maybe one hundred grand.

18
00:02:15,397 --> 00:02:17,126
I'd like a closer look.

19
00:02:20,602 --> 00:02:23,730
Hey, he can't leave
a crime scene with evidence.

20
00:02:23,972 --> 00:02:26,065
You want to stop him?
Be my guest!

21
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:52,164
According to this, the Laughing Dragon
has own reputation.

22
00:02:53,936 --> 00:02:57,030
Ever since it was carved in China,
nearly thirty years ago...

23
00:02:57,105 --> 00:03:00,973
...it has passed to several owners,
all of them died prematurely.

24
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,039
And I can tell you why.

25
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:06,844
This so called jade is admitting
low level radiation.

26
00:03:09,017 --> 00:03:12,732
Alfred, isn't Bruce Wayne about due
for a trip to Metropolis?

27
00:03:12,855 --> 00:03:15,847
Yes but do you think
this is a appropriate time?

28
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,525
I'd say the timing
couldn't be better.

29
00:03:37,179 --> 00:03:39,224
Ladies and gentlemen of the press,...

30
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:42,974
...if you stay calm, you may
actually live to write about this.

31
00:03:43,218 --> 00:03:44,947
Is the president secured?

32
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,247
Copy. We've already informed him...

33
00:03:47,322 --> 00:03:49,213
<i>...about changing flight plans.</i>

34
00:04:01,003 --> 00:04:03,801
Let's make an example of this hero.

35
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:10,444
A very tragic example,
I'm afraid, Miss...?

36
00:04:11,013 --> 00:04:11,911
Lane.

37
00:04:12,314 --> 00:04:16,348
Lane? Lois Lane?
The one Superman always saves?

38
00:04:16,852 --> 00:04:18,319
Afraid, so.

39
00:04:33,302 --> 00:04:35,236
Thanks for strapping me in.

40
00:04:55,591 --> 00:04:57,957
Happy I can help out, Mr. President.

41
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:07,495
I hope I didn't shake you
and the others up too bad.

42
00:05:07,803 --> 00:05:10,465
I had to say,
I've got used to it.

43
00:05:16,778 --> 00:05:17,870
Um, Superman?

44
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,710
Yes?

45
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,039
Um, how can I put this:
I was just thinking...

46
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,840
...it might be nice
to see each other...

47
00:05:26,922 --> 00:05:30,221
...when I wasn't, I don't know,
falling out a window or something.

48
00:05:30,292 --> 00:05:33,955
Not that I'm not grateful for all the times
you've helped me, you understand.

49
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:36,163
- I understand.
- You do?

50
00:05:44,306 --> 00:05:48,572
- It's the First National Bank.
- You better go. People might...

51
00:05:49,344 --> 00:05:50,470
...get hurt.

52
00:05:56,018 --> 00:05:57,383
"I understand, Lois."

53
00:05:57,452 --> 00:06:00,478
"Really, you do?
Yep, you're a complete moron."

54
00:06:00,555 --> 00:06:04,814
"Why thank you, Superman,
I think I'm a total loser, too." Jeez.

55
00:06:05,327 --> 00:06:08,023
"A grateful president
with stocks heartfelt thanks...

56
00:06:08,096 --> 00:06:11,361
"...to Metropolis' favourite son,
Superman."

57
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:14,393
Favourite son of a...

58
00:06:16,772 --> 00:06:17,534
Mercy!

59
00:06:17,739 --> 00:06:19,730
Start the car.
I'm coming down.

60
00:06:22,044 --> 00:06:23,341
Right away, Lex.

61
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:46,825
The office, now.

62
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,469
Swell, Mr. L.

63
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,470
Mr. L.? Mercy?

64
00:06:56,278 --> 00:06:58,439
Oh, yeah. She had a little accident.

65
00:07:10,492 --> 00:07:11,818
All right, missy.

66
00:07:11,893 --> 00:07:14,043
I don't know what your game is
but I promise you,...

67
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,460
...you'll pay dearly for this!

68
00:07:16,164 --> 00:07:17,859
You're dead!
Do you hear me?

69
00:07:19,234 --> 00:07:20,633
Blah, blah, blah.

70
00:07:22,037 --> 00:07:25,165
Whoa, momma,
check out the cute hitchhiker!

71
00:07:36,384 --> 00:07:37,373
Joker.

72
00:07:37,753 --> 00:07:41,955
Lexy, you old kid.
Do I have a deal for you.

73
00:07:55,504 --> 00:07:57,836
Rich Corinthian leather.

74
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,602
What do you want?

75
00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:03,844
I sense we are kindred spirits,
you and I.

76
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:07,446
Oh, there are differences,
to be sure... like hair.

77
00:08:08,717 --> 00:08:12,517
But underneath it all, we are both
entreprenuers, men of vision.

78
00:08:12,788 --> 00:08:15,985
We see an opportunity, we grab it.
Am I right?

79
00:08:19,361 --> 00:08:20,419
Right.

80
00:08:20,896 --> 00:08:24,525
But in the past few weeks,
I've had run a bad luck.

81
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:26,794
Bad luck that it wears a cape.

82
00:08:26,968 --> 00:08:30,404
Thanks to that miserable
pointy ear rodent Batman...

83
00:08:30,472 --> 00:08:33,703
...all my operations in Gotham City
had been shut down.

84
00:08:35,877 --> 00:08:39,313
But you too, have an over-growned
bully in long underwear...

85
00:08:39,748 --> 00:08:42,740
...which brings me
to my little proposition.

86
00:08:42,818 --> 00:08:43,944
I'm listening.

87
00:08:44,186 --> 00:08:47,485
Pay me one billion dollars,
and I'll kill Superman!

88
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:52,491
What makes you think
you can kill Superman...

89
00:08:52,561 --> 00:08:56,554
...when you can't even handle
a mere mortal in a Halloween costume?

90
00:08:58,233 --> 00:09:00,997
There's nothing mere
about that mortal!

91
00:09:01,369 --> 00:09:04,236
Besides, I have read up
on your fly boy.

92
00:09:04,439 --> 00:09:06,839
I know his weakness.

93
00:09:10,612 --> 00:09:13,172
See? Solid Kryptonite.

94
00:09:13,748 --> 00:09:16,410
You know, I can't be connected
to this anyway.

95
00:09:16,852 --> 00:09:19,480
Oh, you'll be Mr. Clean, I promise.

96
00:09:20,055 --> 00:09:21,283
Deal?

97
00:09:22,524 --> 00:09:23,456
Deal.

98
00:09:25,694 --> 00:09:27,719
LEXCORP AIR FIELD
PRIVATE

99
00:09:30,832 --> 00:09:33,858
I hear Wayne's deal with the Lexcorp
could run into the billions.

100
00:09:33,935 --> 00:09:37,632
- He is a high roller.
- I hear, he's nothing but Gotham trash.

101
00:09:38,006 --> 00:09:39,803
Rich, spoiled and...

102
00:09:40,809 --> 00:09:43,209
...absolutely gorgeous!

103
00:09:48,183 --> 00:09:49,377
Mr. Wayne!

104
00:09:49,551 --> 00:09:52,611
- What brings you to Metropolis?
- How long will you stay?

105
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,221
Quick, is my hair straight?

106
00:10:00,495 --> 00:10:01,519
Excuse me.

107
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,157
Aren't you the famous Lois Lane?

108
00:10:08,603 --> 00:10:13,199
Me? Famous? Well, hardly.
I mean... This is Clark Kent.

109
00:10:14,743 --> 00:10:15,767
Mr. Wayne.

110
00:10:17,312 --> 00:10:20,179
I've read all about your adventure
on Air Force One.

111
00:10:20,248 --> 00:10:22,045
You are quite a news maker.

112
00:10:22,651 --> 00:10:24,016
No more than you.

113
00:10:24,252 --> 00:10:26,846
Which brings up the question,
why you are in town?

114
00:10:26,988 --> 00:10:28,888
Mr. Wayne, your car.

115
00:10:30,525 --> 00:10:33,983
Maybe we can discuss it
over dinner, if you are available.

116
00:10:34,296 --> 00:10:38,357
Totally. I... I mean, I think so.
I'll have to check my... Ok, yes.

117
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,767
Great. I'll pick you up at eight.

118
00:11:02,691 --> 00:11:05,956
More to figure, a guy named Weasel,
can cook this good?

119
00:11:06,661 --> 00:11:10,995
Ceasar Carlini, my old pal!
Why I haven't seen you since...

120
00:11:11,733 --> 00:11:15,225
Wait, I've never seen you, have I?
You need to get out more.

121
00:11:15,403 --> 00:11:19,100
- Who is this clown?
- Not clown. Joker.

122
00:11:22,744 --> 00:11:26,475
I'm in town on business
and I need a place to hang my hat.

123
00:11:26,881 --> 00:11:28,371
Try a motel night.

124
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:32,682
But it will be so much cosier
at your place, like a sleepover.

125
00:11:33,154 --> 00:11:35,588
Are you nuts? Kill him!

126
00:11:41,296 --> 00:11:42,695
Can I play too?

127
00:11:54,576 --> 00:11:58,535
Carlini, all that spicy food.
You look a little gassy.

128
00:12:00,348 --> 00:12:01,679
No! Stop!

129
00:12:14,796 --> 00:12:18,562
Holly guacamole.
Looks like you need a new leader.

130
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,425
I nominate me.

131
00:12:22,203 --> 00:12:24,266
I'm sec in the nomination.

132
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,207
All apposed?

133
00:12:28,576 --> 00:12:31,101
They found him like this
at the city dump.

134
00:12:32,447 --> 00:12:36,008
- The lights are on, but nobody is home.
- But we know who did it.

135
00:12:36,217 --> 00:12:37,878
He is telling us right now.

136
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,853
As you can see, WayneLex T-7
contrives the most difficult terrain...

137
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,623
...never losing sight of
it's ultimate target.

138
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,702
14,8 seconds.

139
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:41,676
- Congratulations.
- This is your project too, you know.

140
00:13:42,283 --> 00:13:45,218
Well, I'm proud of the work
both our teams have done.

141
00:13:45,453 --> 00:13:48,911
These robots are gonna revolutionize
unman space travel.

142
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:53,825
Actually, they're maybe useful
closer to Earth.

143
00:13:57,532 --> 00:13:59,966
The Joint Chief has showned
tremendous interest.

144
00:14:00,034 --> 00:14:03,970
It doesn't take much imagination
to invasion these robots on the battlefield.

145
00:14:05,607 --> 00:14:07,905
Except I won't allowed.

146
00:14:08,243 --> 00:14:10,768
- What?
- I don't like guns.

147
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:14,605
Well, Bruce, I think
I have something to say about this.

148
00:14:15,183 --> 00:14:16,912
Not according to our deal.

149
00:14:17,318 --> 00:14:20,617
All technological applications
need my approval first.

150
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:22,588
Blame it on me, Lex.

151
00:14:22,991 --> 00:14:26,927
Tell your pals at the Pentagon
I just don't have the magination.

152
00:14:29,931 --> 00:14:32,229
So he just appears
when there is trouble?

153
00:14:32,367 --> 00:14:33,766
No special signal?

154
00:14:33,935 --> 00:14:36,563
He's not like your Batman,
thank goodness.

155
00:14:36,838 --> 00:14:38,562
Then how do you contact him?

156
00:14:39,741 --> 00:14:41,504
Committing a felony helps.

157
00:14:42,143 --> 00:14:44,509
Listen, you seem awfully
interested in Superman.

158
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:46,672
Do you want me to fix you two up?

159
00:14:47,015 --> 00:14:47,947
Sorry.

160
00:14:48,016 --> 00:14:50,765
No, I'm sorry. It's just that
I was hoping to get away from...

161
00:14:50,795 --> 00:14:53,582
...the subject of the "Man of Steel"
for one night.

162
00:14:53,655 --> 00:14:56,123
I've been a little too consumed
with him lately.

163
00:15:02,397 --> 00:15:04,228
Maybe we could change subjects.

164
00:15:06,234 --> 00:15:09,268
- No more men in tights.
- Deal.

165
00:15:30,792 --> 00:15:32,384
So just keep your ears open.

166
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,151
Let me know if you hear
any buzz about The Joker.

167
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,630
Sure thing, Mr. Kent.

168
00:15:41,669 --> 00:15:45,305
Eh, but, eh, which one?
There's lots of jokers around here.

169
00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:17,238
Hey, sweetheart!
What are you, dead? Come around!

170
00:16:21,142 --> 00:16:22,507
What's going on?

171
00:16:24,045 --> 00:16:25,273
Who is he?

172
00:16:29,617 --> 00:16:31,551
It's been a long time, Binko.

173
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,888
I heard your boss Carlini
has been replaced.

174
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:39,826
We need to talk!

175
00:16:58,846 --> 00:17:00,072
Get him!

176
00:17:20,635 --> 00:17:22,000
Where's the Joker?

177
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:24,937
Who knows?
Makin' ha-ha with Harley Quinn.

178
00:17:26,607 --> 00:17:30,236
I don't know! Honest! I never
went back after he muscled him!

179
00:17:30,311 --> 00:17:32,677
I don't want nothing to do
with that clown.

180
00:17:32,747 --> 00:17:35,511
That's enough.
I think you got your answer.

181
00:17:53,768 --> 00:17:56,601
I heard you were crazy,
but I didn't think you were stupid.

182
00:18:01,642 --> 00:18:02,802
Bruce Wayne?

183
00:18:03,511 --> 00:18:07,106
- You peeked.
- I won't let vigilantism in my town.

184
00:18:07,582 --> 00:18:11,143
You'll be rid of me,
as soon as I find the Joker.

185
00:18:11,753 --> 00:18:13,448
That may not be soon enough.

186
00:18:18,526 --> 00:18:20,460
It doesn't take much, does it?

187
00:18:20,895 --> 00:18:23,921
The Joker has twenty pounds more
where this came from.

188
00:18:24,432 --> 00:18:26,127
I thought you might want to know.

189
00:18:55,963 --> 00:18:56,725
Hello.

190
00:18:56,998 --> 00:19:00,764
Hi. I just wanted to let you know
I'll be in late tomorrow.

191
00:19:00,835 --> 00:19:02,864
I'm having breakfast with Bruce.

192
00:19:04,372 --> 00:19:05,666
Isn't that special?

193
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,165
Do I detect a note of disapproval?

194
00:19:08,709 --> 00:19:10,939
You were the one
who compared him to garbage.

195
00:19:11,012 --> 00:19:12,445
<i>Well, I was wrong.</i>

196
00:19:14,248 --> 00:19:16,879
He's very thoughtful
and much deeper...

197
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,089
...than the gossip mongers
would let you believe.

198
00:19:19,287 --> 00:19:20,481
You'd be surprised.

199
00:19:20,822 --> 00:19:22,414
Would I know?

200
00:19:25,726 --> 00:19:27,750
<i>I'll let you go,
so you count sheep...</i>

201
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:30,557
<i>...or whatever you
Kansas boys dream about.</i>

202
00:19:30,665 --> 00:19:31,632
<i>Bye.</i>

203
00:19:53,788 --> 00:19:54,982
Touché.

204
00:20:03,431 --> 00:20:07,761
"...the Senator declined comment."

205
00:20:08,436 --> 00:20:09,403
Done.

206
00:20:10,738 --> 00:20:12,205
And not a moment too soon.

207
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,873
Bruce! When did you...?

208
00:20:13,941 --> 00:20:17,172
About three paragraphs ago.
I didn't want to distract you.

209
00:20:17,245 --> 00:20:18,974
Ready to due the town?

210
00:20:19,046 --> 00:20:22,015
Give me a minute to see the Chief.
Then I'm all yours.

211
00:20:24,819 --> 00:20:26,980
Clark, keep an eye
on Bruce, will you?

212
00:20:28,022 --> 00:20:29,250
I'll be right back.

213
00:20:30,391 --> 00:20:31,517
Actually Lois...

214
00:20:31,592 --> 00:20:32,923
Don't be intimidated.

215
00:20:32,994 --> 00:20:36,862
Regale him with mad cab tales
of the nightlife in Smallville.

216
00:20:38,165 --> 00:20:39,792
She never stops, doesn't she?

217
00:20:39,867 --> 00:20:41,248
Not that I've noticed.

218
00:20:41,649 --> 00:20:43,249
Any luck find the comedian?

219
00:20:43,771 --> 00:20:46,706
Three nights, and not
so much as a green hair.

220
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:50,336
Of course, you have been dividing
your time between work and Lois.

221
00:20:50,444 --> 00:20:51,672
Is that a problem?

222
00:20:52,179 --> 00:20:53,840
Let's just say I'm concerned.

223
00:20:53,915 --> 00:20:57,282
Your reputation is... dubious.
In and out of costume.

224
00:20:57,952 --> 00:21:00,987
Don't worry.
I'm taking Lois quite seriously.

225
00:21:01,956 --> 00:21:04,447
Besides, it seems to me,
you had your chance.

226
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:08,893
So, Mr. Wayne,
ready to sweet me of my feet?

227
00:21:11,499 --> 00:21:12,693
Be seein' you.

228
00:21:27,048 --> 00:21:29,312
This city is gorgeous at night.

229
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:32,244
Is it? I wasn't looking at the city.

230
00:21:35,456 --> 00:21:37,924
Lois, about Clark Kent.

231
00:21:38,492 --> 00:21:40,858
Are you and he... I mean...

232
00:21:42,196 --> 00:21:46,360
No, Bruce. Your only competition
flew away some time ago.

233
00:21:48,536 --> 00:21:51,801
My, you do live dangerously.

234
00:21:54,709 --> 00:21:58,406
Don't you realize you're moving in
on Superman's main squeeze?

235
00:21:58,713 --> 00:22:00,010
And then I said...

236
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:00,911
Huh?

237
00:22:14,562 --> 00:22:16,496
Take your hands of her, you...

238
00:22:30,511 --> 00:22:32,342
See that he's street pizza!

239
00:22:32,413 --> 00:22:35,439
In this town, some flying fool
could have caught him!

240
00:23:07,982 --> 00:23:10,280
Well, aren't we tenacious?

241
00:23:19,126 --> 00:23:21,094
Catch you next time, Brucie.

242
00:23:28,569 --> 00:23:31,299
Swell. Now, Gotham
sending us their wackos.

243
00:23:31,405 --> 00:23:35,171
Don't worry, Mr. Wayne.
The S.I.U. will get her back safe and sound.

244
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,677
Thank you, inspector.

245
00:23:39,814 --> 00:23:42,112
You realize, she's just a bait.

246
00:23:42,183 --> 00:23:44,811
- I'll be careful.
- Careful won't cut it out.

247
00:23:44,985 --> 00:23:49,217
- With Joker, expect the unexpected.
- Maybe you should remember that.

248
00:23:55,896 --> 00:23:59,927
Think of it, Miss Lane.
This rock is more precious than gold.

249
00:24:00,201 --> 00:24:04,331
One tinny chip will go for thousands
on the collectors market...

250
00:24:04,939 --> 00:24:07,339
...after it kills your fly boy.

251
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:22,121
- You sick, demented, murdering freak!
- How rude!

252
00:24:26,293 --> 00:24:29,558
Half for now and half for later.

253
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:33,926
You've got a front-row seat
for the story of the century, my dear.

254
00:24:34,001 --> 00:24:36,162
The death of Superman.

255
00:25:17,111 --> 00:25:18,840
S.I.U., Turpin.

256
00:25:19,413 --> 00:25:22,703
Leave the screen, "turnip".
I wanna talk to the boy in blue.

257
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:24,905
If you got something
to say clown, say it to...

258
00:25:25,619 --> 00:25:28,486
I'm here, Joker.
What have you done with Lois Lane?

259
00:25:29,123 --> 00:25:33,321
She's right here, Superman,
and she'd love to see you.

260
00:25:34,829 --> 00:25:37,320
Want to know where "here" is?

261
00:25:37,431 --> 00:25:38,659
Don't blink.

262
00:25:45,406 --> 00:25:48,102
Got the pictures, Supie?
Come alone.

263
00:25:49,043 --> 00:25:52,444
No cops or little Lois dies laughing.

264
00:25:54,882 --> 00:25:57,146
Wait! What picture?
What did he mean?

265
00:26:25,346 --> 00:26:29,749
More powerful than a locomotive...
and just about as subtle.

266
00:26:33,687 --> 00:26:36,315
I'm flattered,
you put on your Sunday best.

267
00:26:38,158 --> 00:26:39,648
Where is she, Joker?

268
00:26:39,894 --> 00:26:41,293
Forget about Lois.

269
00:26:43,097 --> 00:26:45,088
Fix your eyes on this!

270
00:26:51,639 --> 00:26:53,392
Now, I'll asking once more.

271
00:27:00,681 --> 00:27:04,981
I don't understand.
I had it all planned so perfectly.

272
00:27:10,591 --> 00:27:12,286
Oh, wait. That's is!

273
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:13,758
What?

274
00:27:13,994 --> 00:27:17,122
Silly me. I forgot the acid.

275
00:27:30,978 --> 00:27:32,946
What's the matter, Supie?

276
00:27:36,183 --> 00:27:38,835
No steam left in the old locomotive?

277
00:28:06,613 --> 00:28:08,706
I hope you're taking notes.

278
00:28:11,318 --> 00:28:12,542
Not now.

279
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:15,550
But puddin',
Batman has headed your way!

280
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,079
Get out.

281
00:28:22,529 --> 00:28:26,397
Pardon my haste exit.
We have a pest control problem.

282
00:28:28,736 --> 00:28:31,068
Feel free to expire any time.

283
00:29:04,772 --> 00:29:06,262
I'll be back in a moment.

284
00:29:14,248 --> 00:29:16,842
Two of the prize of one!
I love it.

285
00:29:17,151 --> 00:29:20,814
And the best part is,
you're all going out with a smile.

286
00:29:21,722 --> 00:29:23,553
Have a happy ending!

287
00:29:34,134 --> 00:29:35,624
Hydrochloric Acid.

288
00:29:36,103 --> 00:29:38,401
It will take a week
to eat through the wall.

289
00:29:38,739 --> 00:29:40,939
No, wait.

290
00:29:42,476 --> 00:29:43,738
Kryptonite.

291
00:30:02,296 --> 00:30:05,561
Snap out of it, Kent,
or Joker gets the last laugh.

292
00:30:11,705 --> 00:30:13,138
Keep your heads down!

293
00:30:22,049 --> 00:30:24,449
- They're loose.
- That's not fair.

294
00:30:30,357 --> 00:30:31,824
It's over, Joker.

295
00:30:36,296 --> 00:30:38,662
It hasn't begun, Supie!

296
00:30:40,834 --> 00:30:42,358
He's gotta be kidding.

297
00:30:50,177 --> 00:30:53,212
- They're grenades!
- Expect the unexpected.

298
00:31:08,428 --> 00:31:11,454
Thank you. I couldn't
have saved Lois without your help.

299
00:31:11,532 --> 00:31:12,692
I'm aware of that.

300
00:31:31,485 --> 00:31:34,113
Bruce! Bruce Wayne.
He was with me when Joker...

301
00:31:34,354 --> 00:31:38,654
- Is he all right? Do you know?
- He is fine. Just fine.

302
00:31:47,935 --> 00:31:51,803
I wish to assure all of Metropolis that
this explosion was not nuclear...

303
00:31:51,872 --> 00:31:54,204
...and presents no danger
to the community.

304
00:31:54,274 --> 00:31:55,764
Now, if you excuse me.

305
00:31:55,842 --> 00:31:58,072
And what about the Joker,
Mr. Luthor?

306
00:31:58,112 --> 00:32:00,444
You didn't answer the question.
What about Joker?

307
00:32:00,445 --> 00:32:01,445
You heard the man.

308
00:32:05,452 --> 00:32:08,243
What could have possessed me
to trust that clown?

309
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:14,518
Hello, Mr. J. I'm Batman!
Eat me! Eat me! Eat me!

310
00:32:16,563 --> 00:32:19,191
I know, you are trying
to cheer me up, Harley.

311
00:32:19,466 --> 00:32:22,833
But you see, anytime I lost
a billion dollar deal...

312
00:32:22,936 --> 00:32:25,001
...it really kills my appetite!

313
00:32:44,224 --> 00:32:48,125
Honestly, Lex, don't you think
I feel bad enough already?

314
00:32:49,496 --> 00:32:51,698
You maniac! You idiot!

315
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:54,199
How dare you use one of
my laboratories for your...

316
00:32:54,201 --> 00:32:55,190
Harley.

317
00:32:57,304 --> 00:32:59,033
Put him down, baldy!

318
00:32:59,673 --> 00:33:00,662
Mercy!

319
00:33:02,876 --> 00:33:04,605
Here's for that punch in the face!

320
00:33:04,811 --> 00:33:07,575
Can't we discuss this
like gentlemen?

321
00:33:09,983 --> 00:33:12,679
Oh, listen to
Little Miss Can't-Take-A-Joke!

322
00:33:15,522 --> 00:33:17,990
Thank you.
Have a seat, please.

323
00:33:21,662 --> 00:33:22,856
Banzai!

324
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:29,125
You owe me an explanation.

325
00:33:29,403 --> 00:33:31,398
The lab was a perfect setup.

326
00:33:31,471 --> 00:33:33,905
How did I know
old bat brat would show up?

327
00:33:33,974 --> 00:33:36,340
Batman?
He followed you to Metropolis?

328
00:33:37,811 --> 00:33:39,779
Oh, right. Like it's my fault.

329
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,778
Look, I still got half of the kryptonite.
I can still finish the job.

330
00:33:44,251 --> 00:33:46,913
But if I have to cook
with two men in tights...

331
00:33:46,987 --> 00:33:48,477
...the prize goes up.

332
00:33:48,588 --> 00:33:49,646
Unacceptable.

333
00:33:49,723 --> 00:33:53,557
If you can't handle some mental case
in a fright mask, our deal is off.

334
00:33:55,262 --> 00:33:56,889
Mercy, let's go!

335
00:33:57,564 --> 00:34:00,590
Keep in mind,
this is your last chance.

336
00:34:09,943 --> 00:34:14,123
- How you doin', slugger?
- A-okay, Mr. J.!

337
00:34:23,757 --> 00:34:25,884
Hey, Smallville!
Come in. What's up?

338
00:34:26,593 --> 00:34:29,084
I see you are holding up
after last night.

339
00:34:29,162 --> 00:34:30,322
I've been...

340
00:34:33,834 --> 00:34:35,859
I didn't realize you had company.

341
00:34:36,169 --> 00:34:38,603
You might at least
tell me why you stopped by.

342
00:34:38,839 --> 00:34:40,306
I have been nosing around.

343
00:34:40,374 --> 00:34:43,605
I think I may know why the Joker
is suddenly after Superman.

344
00:34:43,677 --> 00:34:45,868
Well, don't keep us in suspense.

345
00:34:46,947 --> 00:34:50,007
I think he is in chorus with
your boyfriend's business partner.

346
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,184
With Lex? Are you sure?

347
00:34:52,419 --> 00:34:54,284
I can't prove it, yet.

348
00:34:55,489 --> 00:34:58,155
I suppose I could ask him.

349
00:35:10,036 --> 00:35:11,298
What? Who?

350
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:18,538
What do you want?

351
00:35:18,779 --> 00:35:22,560
Information. Regarding
a mutual of Queens.

352
00:35:22,649 --> 00:35:25,015
What are you talking about?
I don't know any...

353
00:35:27,888 --> 00:35:30,889
You know exactly who I mean.
Where is he?

354
00:35:31,224 --> 00:35:33,283
What kind of deal
have you made with him?

355
00:35:33,527 --> 00:35:35,392
I don't... I...

356
00:35:35,462 --> 00:35:37,623
- Mr. Luthor, are you alright?
- Who is in there?

357
00:35:37,697 --> 00:35:39,255
- Open up!
- He is in trouble.

358
00:35:39,332 --> 00:35:41,926
- The door is locked.
- I don't have the keys.

359
00:35:47,808 --> 00:35:50,003
Think about it. I'll be back.

360
00:35:52,145 --> 00:35:53,510
Allright, break it.

361
00:35:58,151 --> 00:35:59,982
- Mr. Luthor?
- Get out!

362
00:36:11,164 --> 00:36:13,132
Contact the clown immediately.

363
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,169
It appears we'll have to deal
with his friend after all.

364
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,829
A transfer?

365
00:36:21,475 --> 00:36:24,273
Just to the Planet's
Gotham City bureaux.

366
00:36:25,245 --> 00:36:27,179
Is this mean you and Bruce...

367
00:36:27,614 --> 00:36:30,797
We haven't made it formal
commitment or anything but...

368
00:36:30,798 --> 00:36:32,975
...yeah, it's that serious.

369
00:36:33,286 --> 00:36:34,981
Hey, chin up, Smallville.

370
00:36:35,055 --> 00:36:37,956
With me out of the picture,
you might get a shot a stardom.

371
00:36:38,024 --> 00:36:39,286
Lois! Clark!

372
00:36:39,726 --> 00:36:41,909
I just got the word
cruise ship SS Atlantis...

373
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:44,310
...has sending a distress call
200 miles off-shore.

374
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:50,969
Exactly. Call the Coast Guard to confirm
and cruise line for a statement.

375
00:36:51,438 --> 00:36:53,269
You're not out of here yet, Lane.

376
00:37:18,665 --> 00:37:21,498
LAFF NIGHT AT HOBBS BAY

377
00:37:22,068 --> 00:37:24,065
What the devil is he up to now?

378
00:37:25,005 --> 00:37:26,939
A change of attire, sir?

379
00:37:28,775 --> 00:37:31,266
How fast can we get to Hobbs Bay?

380
00:37:36,049 --> 00:37:39,116
If I maybe required
when you're home, sir?

381
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,898
- What's the problem, captain?
- What do you mean?

382
00:37:53,033 --> 00:37:56,799
- You send out a distress call, didn't you?
- Not on my authorization.

383
00:38:03,276 --> 00:38:06,712
There is the culprit.
It's broadcasting an electronic beacon.

384
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,978
If one of my crews is responsible
for this prank, they...

385
00:38:15,689 --> 00:38:17,418
What is it? What's happening?

386
00:38:22,829 --> 00:38:24,820
Whoever sent that distress signal...

387
00:38:25,298 --> 00:38:27,416
...just provided the distress.

388
00:38:40,947 --> 00:38:42,676
Copy-bat! Copy-bat!

389
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:46,776
Suffering from
propulsion envy, Batboy?

390
00:38:48,421 --> 00:38:49,513
TARGET IDENTIFIED

391
00:38:54,461 --> 00:38:56,759
Think of it's a welcome wagon Bats...

392
00:38:57,097 --> 00:39:00,225
...welcoming you
to the nearest mortuary.

393
00:39:48,715 --> 00:39:52,742
Oh, this could be a fair fight after all!
And who wants to see that?

394
00:40:49,242 --> 00:40:51,836
Evening, Miss Lane.
Where is Mr. Kent?

395
00:40:51,911 --> 00:40:53,640
Probably have asking some corn.

396
00:40:53,713 --> 00:40:55,613
- Mrs. Lane?
- Yeah, I'm still here.

397
00:40:57,016 --> 00:41:00,645
Superman is towing the ship to harbour?
Can you find out how close he is?

398
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,846
Yeah, I'll hold.

399
00:41:12,565 --> 00:41:14,795
Let me guess.
You're the only one here.

400
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,277
Is there something I should know?

401
00:41:41,327 --> 00:41:44,023
- How do I contact Superman?
- He's out at sea!

402
00:41:44,397 --> 00:41:46,490
Never around when you need him.

403
00:41:55,608 --> 00:41:57,803
Stay here. I'm the one it's after.

404
00:42:35,748 --> 00:42:36,715
Bruce?

405
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:56,193
So when were you going to tell me?
The honeymoon?

406
00:43:04,777 --> 00:43:06,244
Stay back.

407
00:43:12,302 --> 00:43:13,360
Did I miss anything?

408
00:43:13,987 --> 00:43:18,251
<i>Reports to get the target acqusition
negative, Mr. Luthor. Sorry.</i>

409
00:43:20,493 --> 00:43:21,858
He survived.

410
00:43:21,928 --> 00:43:25,022
He lasted long enough
to Superman to save him.

411
00:43:25,098 --> 00:43:27,293
- Then, they have the robot.
- I know.

412
00:43:27,567 --> 00:43:30,195
- But, Lex, they'll trace it back to you...
- I know!

413
00:43:31,871 --> 00:43:34,266
Call the clown.
I need one last meeting.

414
00:43:43,449 --> 00:43:47,847
- How could you have lied to me like that?
- Now, I never actually said I wasn't Batman.

415
00:43:49,722 --> 00:43:51,713
You want to know
what really galls me?

416
00:43:51,791 --> 00:43:55,158
I mean, besides the fact that
the new man in my life is really two men?

417
00:43:55,228 --> 00:43:58,095
It's that I'm sitting on
the hottest story of the year...

418
00:43:58,164 --> 00:44:02,594
..."Batman Unmasked!" and there's
not a blessed thing I can do about it!

419
00:44:03,569 --> 00:44:07,005
- Then you really do love me.
- I'll get some iodine for that scrape.

420
00:44:09,042 --> 00:44:11,533
Burning, stinging iodine.

421
00:44:15,615 --> 00:44:18,550
- I see, she is taking it well.
- It's ironic, you know.

422
00:44:19,052 --> 00:44:21,384
She likes Bruce Wayne
and she likes Superman.

423
00:44:21,554 --> 00:44:23,920
It's the other two guys
she's not crazy about.

424
00:44:24,157 --> 00:44:26,318
Too bad we can't mix-and-match.

425
00:44:27,894 --> 00:44:30,692
I'm not used to be rescued.
Thanks.

426
00:44:31,164 --> 00:44:32,392
I owe you one.

427
00:44:32,498 --> 00:44:36,229
That robot tonight, it came
from Lexcorp. I can prove it.

428
00:44:36,469 --> 00:44:39,905
That's why I'm here. I figured you might
wanna help me, bring Luthor in.

429
00:44:39,973 --> 00:44:42,548
A partnership? You're joking!

430
00:44:42,583 --> 00:44:46,234
Actually I'm having trouble finding Luthor
and I thought you might have some ideas.

431
00:44:46,312 --> 00:44:50,578
I might. She's not gonna like this,
me leaving so soon for another fight.

432
00:44:50,783 --> 00:44:51,909
Tell me about it.

433
00:44:54,087 --> 00:44:56,647
That cut on your shoulder
look pretty nasty, Bruce.

434
00:44:56,723 --> 00:44:58,520
I know a good doctor who...

435
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:01,353
Oh, no.

436
00:45:03,229 --> 00:45:04,423
Has to be done.

437
00:45:05,631 --> 00:45:10,295
I don't suppose a stern lecture on
unnecessary risk-taking is going to sway you.

438
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:12,262
Sorry.

439
00:45:13,106 --> 00:45:16,337
I didn't think so.
Just be... careful.

440
00:45:19,712 --> 00:45:22,374
Look at all the toys!

441
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:25,283
Santa has been good to you, Lex.

442
00:45:25,718 --> 00:45:28,482
Joker, we got serious problems.

443
00:45:33,393 --> 00:45:35,156
A flying wing!

444
00:45:35,395 --> 00:45:37,795
Twenty times bigger than Batman's.

445
00:45:37,997 --> 00:45:41,558
- And knowing you, a hundred times lethal!
- Joker!

446
00:45:41,934 --> 00:45:44,402
Did you bring
the rest of the cryptonite?

447
00:45:44,704 --> 00:45:47,434
Right here, cromedome.
What's the plan?

448
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,629
Pay back.

449
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:55,642
What's so funny?

450
00:45:56,382 --> 00:45:59,613
Don't you get it, Harl?
We've been set up to take the fall.

451
00:45:59,886 --> 00:46:01,353
He can't do that.

452
00:46:01,687 --> 00:46:04,087
Oh, no? How is this sound?

453
00:46:04,624 --> 00:46:08,788
When I've heard that one of my robots
had been commandeer to kill Batman...

454
00:46:09,061 --> 00:46:14,987
...I personally came here to investigate
and much to my surprise, I found to you two.

455
00:46:15,101 --> 00:46:19,497
It'll be your words against puddin's.
I... I mean, Mr. J's.

456
00:46:20,039 --> 00:46:23,497
Somehow poodle, I don't think
we're gonna get the chance to say much.

457
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:26,444
You... You mean,
he's gonna kill us?

458
00:46:26,779 --> 00:46:31,011
No, she is.
I'm horde violence.

459
00:46:37,523 --> 00:46:39,787
Now, this is funny, Mr. J...

460
00:46:40,126 --> 00:46:43,095
...except we never gonna collect
our billion bucks now.

461
00:46:43,162 --> 00:46:47,223
True, but I see
a delightful consolation prize.

462
00:46:54,073 --> 00:46:58,339
Taa-daa.
Nothing like a nice big smile.

463
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:03,679
- All done.
- I love the personalize all my stuff.

464
00:47:06,986 --> 00:47:11,548
Very amusing. So how much is it
going to cost me to get out of this?

465
00:47:11,858 --> 00:47:14,156
I'm not a material guy, Lexy.

466
00:47:14,327 --> 00:47:17,160
No, what I want now
is for you to know...

467
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:20,393
...what it feels like
to lose everything you have.

468
00:47:20,466 --> 00:47:24,960
Everything you've ever build,
like I lost everything to old Bat-boy.

469
00:47:30,009 --> 00:47:33,001
We have incoming.
Bats and fly boy!

470
00:47:33,246 --> 00:47:35,510
I'll be right in. B-bye.

471
00:47:57,203 --> 00:47:58,261
See anything?

472
00:47:58,337 --> 00:48:02,273
Luthor's been lining all his buildings
with lead. Blocks my X-ray vision.

473
00:48:02,341 --> 00:48:04,741
Well, there's always
the direct approach.

474
00:48:08,681 --> 00:48:10,080
You're learning.

475
00:48:18,925 --> 00:48:22,986
A little distraction would be useful
right now, wouldn't you say, Lexy?

476
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:43,444
I think your toys
can handle this by themselves.

477
00:48:43,516 --> 00:48:46,849
Besides, I hate to spoil
my new paint job.

478
00:48:47,687 --> 00:48:51,179
Now, let see here.
Ignition!

479
00:50:22,615 --> 00:50:26,046
- I couldn't have done it better myself.
- Helps if you're prepared.

480
00:51:12,732 --> 00:51:15,895
- Where is Luthor?
- Joker took him in the Lex Wing.

481
00:51:15,968 --> 00:51:18,562
He said, he'd make him lose
everything he ever build.

482
00:51:19,238 --> 00:51:21,365
Luthor has build half of Metropolis.

483
00:51:30,716 --> 00:51:33,207
Go after the Joker.
I shouldn't be long.

484
00:51:54,874 --> 00:51:56,899
How is it feel, Lexy boy?

485
00:51:56,976 --> 00:51:59,911
Everything with your name on it,
is going to be ravage.

486
00:52:24,603 --> 00:52:27,328
Batman! It's always Batman!

487
00:52:27,673 --> 00:52:30,164
What you got in the way of
air-to-air missiles, Lex?

488
00:52:30,242 --> 00:52:34,872
- You're asking "me" for help?
- If I go down, you go down.

489
00:52:35,648 --> 00:52:37,343
It's a red switch.

490
00:52:37,516 --> 00:52:39,746
Which red...?
Oh, the heck with it!

491
00:53:53,692 --> 00:53:56,627
Lead lined door.
I have to thank, Luthor.

492
00:54:33,832 --> 00:54:35,766
Who is flying this thing?

493
00:54:37,803 --> 00:54:39,794
Do something for God sake!

494
00:54:41,674 --> 00:54:44,040
Inny, miny, miney, moo.

495
00:55:17,042 --> 00:55:20,205
It's gonna blow!
I'll get Quinn, you take Luthor.

496
00:56:00,552 --> 00:56:04,371
- Puddin'!
- At this point, he probably is.

497
00:56:33,619 --> 00:56:35,678
Hello, this is Angela Chen.

498
00:56:35,754 --> 00:56:38,086
Though the search
for the Joker's body continues...

499
00:56:38,157 --> 00:56:40,785
...the Coast Guard reports,
it's extremely unlikely...

500
00:56:40,859 --> 00:56:44,386
...that Gotham's most notorious
criminal survive the crash.

501
00:56:44,563 --> 00:56:47,396
In related news,
billionaire Lex Luthor...

502
00:56:47,466 --> 00:56:50,128
...was again rigorously
grilled by the D.A.'s office...

503
00:56:50,202 --> 00:56:52,966
...over his allege connection
to the Joker's rampage.

504
00:56:53,038 --> 00:56:56,269
His statements have been questioned
both by local law officials...

505
00:56:56,341 --> 00:57:00,090
...and industrialist Bruce Wayne who
announced the immediate termination...

506
00:57:00,112 --> 00:57:01,946
...of his partnership with Lexcorp.

507
00:57:02,781 --> 00:57:04,339
And add a later note...

508
00:57:04,416 --> 00:57:07,681
...Joker accomplice Harley Quinn,
was returned to Arkham Asylum...

509
00:57:07,753 --> 00:57:10,051
...for another
round of rehabilitation.

510
00:57:10,122 --> 00:57:14,320
I want a lawyer! I want a doctor!
I want a cheese sandwich!

511
00:57:15,327 --> 00:57:16,755
Now that's funny!

512
00:57:21,567 --> 00:57:24,058
I still wish you change
your mind about Gotham.

513
00:57:24,136 --> 00:57:27,697
I adore you, Bruce, but now there is
a lot about you I don't know...

514
00:57:27,773 --> 00:57:29,798
...and I'm not sure I wanna know.

515
00:57:30,075 --> 00:57:31,301
I understand.

516
00:57:31,443 --> 00:57:32,942
Take care of yourself.

517
00:57:49,561 --> 00:57:51,236
Come to make sure I'm leaving?

518
00:57:51,237 --> 00:57:53,590
Actually, I thought
we worked pretty well together.

519
00:57:53,732 --> 00:57:56,200
Not that I wanna make
a regular event.

520
00:57:56,268 --> 00:57:59,203
She's all yours now,
if you can handle that.

521
00:57:59,404 --> 00:58:03,472
But you'd better be good to her...
because I know where you live.

522
00:58:23,597 --> 00:58:29,597
