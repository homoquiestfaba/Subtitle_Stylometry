00:19:56,781 --> 00:19:59,684
Okay, uh, ooh...
have I told you the one

354
00:19:59,717 --> 00:20:02,019
about your mommy
and me, and Scientology?

355
00:20:02,053 --> 00:20:03,320
No, what's Scientology?

356
00:20:03,353 --> 00:20:05,823
- Do you know what bullying is?
- Yes.

357
00:20:05,857 --> 00:20:07,558
It's bullying in
the form of religion.

358
00:20:07,592 --> 00:20:08,760
Stay far away.

359
00:20:08,793 --> 00:20:10,828
- I'm Jewish.
- That's great.

360
00:20:10,862 --> 00:20:13,164
So your mommy and I
are on this road trip, right?

361
00:20:13,197 --> 00:20:14,531
And we're driving to LA,

362
00:20:14,565 --> 00:20:17,400
and we come across
this giant castle,

363
00:20:17,434 --> 00:20:19,103
but they're giving
away free breakfast,

364
00:20:19,137 --> 00:20:21,005
and like, who turns down
free breakfast, right?

365
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:24,341
That was the summer after
your sophomore year, right?

366
00:20:25,977 --> 00:20:27,277
Alec.

367
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,411
Oh my God, how are you?

368
00:20:28,445 --> 00:20:30,347
What are you doing?

369
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,382
Wait, are you Bailey's...
are you Bailey's doctor?

370
00:20:32,415 --> 00:20:34,619
Yeah, we've been seeing
each other since the funeral.

371
00:20:34,652 --> 00:20:35,753
- You were at the funeral?
- Oh, yeah.

372
00:20:35,787 --> 00:20:37,287
We spoke for a second.

373
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,524
Oh, like yeah, I literally
have no memory of that.

374
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:42,627
I'm helping Gemma with Bails.

375
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:46,063
She's not a real babysitter,
so I'm gonna call her my Jane.

376
00:20:46,097 --> 00:20:48,065
Aw, I like that.

377
00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:49,366
You ready, Bailey?

378
00:20:50,067 --> 00:20:51,269
[Bailey] Yep.

379
00:20:53,004 --> 00:20:55,472
What does Gemma normally
do when he goes in there?

380
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:57,440
- Oh, she comes back in an hour.
- An hour?

381
00:20:57,474 --> 00:20:58,609
Sometimes, she stays.

382
00:20:58,643 --> 00:21:00,544
Okay, I'll do that.
[laughs]

383
00:21:00,578 --> 00:21:03,581
Sounds like a better plan,
because I, um,

384
00:21:03,614 --> 00:21:05,183
I don't have anywhere to be.

385
00:21:08,753 --> 00:21:11,122
[phone clicking]

386
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,128
- Jane.
- Hey.

387
00:21:17,161 --> 00:21:18,461
Has it been an hour already?

388
00:21:18,495 --> 00:21:20,765
Almost.
You have a second to chat?

389
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:22,099
Yeah, sure.

390
00:21:22,133 --> 00:21:23,601
You cool to be out
here for a sec, B-boy?

391
00:21:23,634 --> 00:21:24,669
Sure.

392
00:21:29,707 --> 00:21:30,975
Are you seeing anyone?

393
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:34,278
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

394
00:21:34,312 --> 00:21:36,247
I got too busy
to date, you know,

395
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,481
after you and I broke up,
Paper And Bliss starting,

396
00:21:38,515 --> 00:21:40,151
and then Fi getting pregnant,

397
00:21:40,184 --> 00:21:42,286
a lot of responsibility, so yeah, no.
[laughs]

398
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,321
[Alec laughs]

399
00:21:43,353 --> 00:21:44,322
What?
[laughs]

400
00:21:44,354 --> 00:21:45,690
Let me rephrase.

401
00:21:45,723 --> 00:21:49,827
Are you seeing
a therapist or a counselor?

402
00:21:50,527 --> 00:21:52,663
- Oh, my God.
- [Alec] Since Fi died.

403
00:21:52,697 --> 00:21:54,364
I feel like a God damn idiot.

404
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:56,000
No, no, not at all.

405
00:21:56,033 --> 00:21:58,135
I mean, you're still
aggressively self-deprecating.

406
00:21:58,169 --> 00:21:59,402
Aggressively determined
to make a fool

407
00:21:59,436 --> 00:22:01,873
out of myself,
that's for sure.

408
00:22:01,906 --> 00:22:04,275
It might not be a bad
idea to see someone.

409
00:22:04,308 --> 00:22:06,777
Wait, are you
suggesting that I see you?

410
00:22:06,811 --> 00:22:08,511
Is that what you're saying?
Because wouldn't that be...

411
00:22:08,545 --> 00:22:10,281
- Unethical, yeah.
- [Jane] Right?

412
00:22:10,314 --> 00:22:12,016
No, I could never
be objective enough,

413
00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:13,516
but I could make some calls.

414
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:15,553
Yeah, no, I'm good, I'm good.

415
00:22:15,586 --> 00:22:16,821
Thank you though.

416
00:22:16,854 --> 00:22:17,889
Yeah.

417
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:22,026
How's he doing, by the way?

418
00:22:23,526 --> 00:22:27,632
Well, imagine being seven,
your mom is gone,

419
00:22:27,665 --> 00:22:29,700
and you can't
logically comprehend why.

420
00:22:30,601 --> 00:22:33,304
What do I do, or not do?

421
00:22:33,337 --> 00:22:34,739
[scoffs]

422
00:22:34,772 --> 00:22:38,142
I literally have no
idea what I'm doing.

423
00:22:38,175 --> 00:22:39,476
Just be his Jane.

424
00:22:40,611 --> 00:22:42,847
If you listen, you'll know
what he needs from you.

425
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,749
Has he mentioned any changes

426
00:22:44,782 --> 00:22:47,151
in Fi's behavior before,
you know?

427
00:22:47,184 --> 00:22:49,086
I guess what
I'm saying is, like,

428
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,656
did he notice
or, like, allude to any...

429
00:22:51,689 --> 00:22:54,926
Jane, I'm a psychiatrist,
not a mind reader.

430
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:56,493
Besides, I can only speak

431
00:22:56,526 --> 00:22:58,495
to a parent
about Bailey's sessions.

432
00:22:58,528 --> 00:23:02,733
Yeah, never were much
of a rule breaker, were you?

433
00:23:05,303 --> 00:23:08,806
Okay, blink once for yes,
raise an eyebrow for no.

434
00:23:14,544 --> 00:23:16,113
I don't know if
you're having a stroke

435
00:23:16,147 --> 00:23:17,782
or trying to be funny;
it's cute though.

436
00:23:17,815 --> 00:23:19,250
[Alec laughs]

437
00:23:19,283 --> 00:23:21,686
Hey, you can call me
if you need anything,

438
00:23:21,719 --> 00:23:23,955
as a friend or whatever.

439
00:23:23,988 --> 00:23:25,089
Little advice though.

440
00:23:25,122 --> 00:23:26,557
Uh-oh.

441
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,960
You need to work
on your winking abilities.

442
00:23:28,993 --> 00:23:30,394
[girl in video] <i>So you're gonna
wanna make sure</i>

443
00:23:30,428 --> 00:23:33,264
<i>that you ask questions.</i>

444
00:23:33,297 --> 00:23:35,465
<i>The parents will like
that because, you know,</i>

445
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:37,868
<i>it'll make you seem
interested and professional,</i>

446
00:23:37,902 --> 00:23:41,772
<i>and like you're on the ball,
and you know the kid's needs.</i>

447
00:23:41,806 --> 00:23:44,041
<i>You're also gonna wanna
have fun with the kid</i>

448
00:23:44,075 --> 00:23:45,943
<i>and do something funny,
because they like that.</i>

449
00:23:45,977 --> 00:23:49,479
<i>You want to make sure that
they know you mean business.</i>

450
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:52,450
I said you're not
the boss of me!

451
00:23:52,482 --> 00:23:53,751
- Wow.
- You're not the boss of me!

452
00:23:53,784 --> 00:23:55,753
Hey, hey, oh, off the couch.

453
00:23:55,786 --> 00:23:58,089
You get down right now.
Bailey, I mean business.

454
00:23:58,122 --> 00:23:59,790
What are you doing?
Oh!

455
00:23:59,824 --> 00:24:01,926
Get down.
What are you doing?

456
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:03,394
Whoa, hey!
[gasps]

457
00:24:03,427 --> 00:24:07,965
I told you,
you're not the boss of me!

458
00:24:09,033 --> 00:24:12,136
Okay, okay, all right,
no I see, here we go.

459
00:24:13,637 --> 00:24:17,341
I'm a mean kid, I'm a mean kid
that's having a tantrum.

460
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:21,112
I'm such a baby, baby,
baby tantrum, baby.

461
00:24:21,145 --> 00:24:23,280
[sighs]

462
00:24:23,314 --> 00:24:24,382
How'd that look?

463
00:24:24,982 --> 00:24:27,517
Yeah, that's what I thought.

464
00:24:28,052 --> 00:24:29,820
[insects chirping, dog barking]

465
00:24:29,854 --> 00:24:31,655
[door opens]

466
00:24:31,689 --> 00:24:34,959
[Gemma sighs]
I'm so sorry I'm late.

467
00:24:34,992 --> 00:24:36,227
Oh, no worries.

468
00:24:37,695 --> 00:24:39,529
Do you want a glass of wine?

469
00:24:39,563 --> 00:24:41,832
Oh, um, okay.

470
00:24:44,735 --> 00:24:46,370
[Gemma] So how was he today?

471
00:24:47,204 --> 00:24:52,610
Oh, he was a little...
he ripped up his homework.

472
00:24:52,643 --> 00:24:54,945
Oh, he's been doing that.
I'm so sorry.

473
00:24:54,979 --> 00:24:56,546
Yeah, it was intense.
[laughs]

474
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,782
[sighs]

475
00:24:57,815 --> 00:25:00,885
- Alec diagnosed him with ADHD.
- Oh.

476
00:25:00,918 --> 00:25:03,054
He suggested I put him
on medication.

477
00:25:03,087 --> 00:25:04,555
Oh.
He's just a kid, I mean,

478
00:25:04,588 --> 00:25:06,190
there's gotta be other
ways to handle it.

479
00:25:06,223 --> 00:25:07,558
You ever read those
advice articles?

480
00:25:07,591 --> 00:25:09,060
They always pop up
on my social media.

481
00:25:09,093 --> 00:25:11,629
It's like I survived cancer
without using chemo,

482
00:25:11,662 --> 00:25:12,830
that kind of stuff.

483
00:25:12,863 --> 00:25:14,165
What's happening
with your hair?

484
00:25:14,198 --> 00:25:16,367
Oh, um...

485
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,671
I... we played hairdresser
and I was the customer.

486
00:25:20,704 --> 00:25:23,074
You were really lucky that he
did not actually cut your hair.

487
00:25:23,107 --> 00:25:25,042
- Yeah.
- He did that to Fi once.

488
00:25:25,076 --> 00:25:26,677
Oh I remember that.

489
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:28,579
Yeah, I think it's gonna
be a little difficult

490
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:30,214
to brush out, but I don't know,
it's just hair.

491
00:25:30,247 --> 00:25:32,083
I'll cut it;
it'll grow out.

492
00:25:32,917 --> 00:25:34,553
Hold that thought,
I'll be right back.

493
00:25:34,585 --> 00:25:36,253
What?

494
00:25:36,287 --> 00:25:38,355
I was kidding
about cutting my hair.

495
00:25:38,389 --> 00:25:39,824
Not getting scissors.

496
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:43,294
What happened
to Fi's painting?

497
00:25:44,862 --> 00:25:47,098
Ah, that's a brush.

498
00:25:47,131 --> 00:25:48,599
It's good.

499
00:26:00,878 --> 00:26:02,847
What do I do with this?

500
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,916
[gentle music]

501
00:26:08,652 --> 00:26:12,591
[Jane] Oh, um, just don't
throw it away.

502
00:26:14,892 --> 00:26:16,260
Yeah.

503
00:26:21,065 --> 00:26:23,634
So what... what happened
to Fi's painting

504
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:25,136
that was by the piano?

505
00:26:30,609 --> 00:26:33,177
Ruth.
Ruth happened.

506
00:26:35,446 --> 00:26:38,215
She also asked me
to bring over Fi's ashes

507
00:26:38,249 --> 00:26:41,152
for her to keep, when we
come to visit for Passover.

508
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:45,823
Ruth, I mean she's
Fi's mom, so.

509
00:26:45,856 --> 00:26:48,125
She was just so
against you even...

510
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,961
It's fine, it's fine,
it'll be fine.

511
00:26:54,165 --> 00:26:57,001
You're gonna keep
some of them though, right?

512
00:26:57,034 --> 00:26:58,669
Yeah, um...

513
00:26:59,703 --> 00:27:02,641
I was thinking of turning
them into a tattoo,

514
00:27:03,474 --> 00:27:05,943
and, like, putting
a little bit of the ashes

515
00:27:05,976 --> 00:27:07,511
mixed in with the ink.

516
00:27:07,545 --> 00:27:09,180
- Say what now?
- I know.

517
00:27:09,213 --> 00:27:11,782
My receptionist
gave me the idea.

518
00:27:11,815 --> 00:27:14,518
She took some of her cat's ashes

519
00:27:14,553 --> 00:27:16,921
and made a paw print tattoo.

520
00:27:16,954 --> 00:27:22,860
Okay, that is somet... I never thought
of you as, like, a tattoo person.

521
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:25,996
Yeah, well,
I never had a reason.

522
00:27:28,667 --> 00:27:30,167
How're we doing back there?

523
00:27:31,335 --> 00:27:33,003
Uh...

524
00:27:33,037 --> 00:27:34,138

- Thank you so much for coming.
- Yeah.

Bailey had an accident today.

Here's the problem.
He did it on purpose.

[laughs]
Come again?

579
00:29:25,482 --> 00:29:27,551
At morning break,
the kids were swapping food,

580
00:29:27,585 --> 00:29:29,621
and Arthur didn't want
to swap his pudding

581
00:29:29,654 --> 00:29:32,590
for Bailey's carrots, so
Bailey threatened to pee on it.

582
00:29:32,624 --> 00:29:34,391
- He didn't.
- He did.

583
00:29:34,425 --> 00:29:36,960
Did he, like, unzip
and, like, bring it out?

584
00:29:36,994 --> 00:29:38,462
No, no.
No.

585
00:29:38,495 --> 00:29:40,898
He grabbed the pudding,
sat on it, and peed.

586
00:29:41,365 --> 00:29:42,801
Jesus, okay.

587
00:29:42,833 --> 00:29:45,302
So we're looking
at a three-day suspension.

588
00:29:45,336 --> 00:29:49,139
Okay, okay, is that necessary?

589
00:29:49,173 --> 00:29:53,143
We don't condone this sort
of behavior at JT Elementary.

590
00:29:53,177 --> 00:29:55,179
Right, right,
but his mom just died,

591
00:29:55,212 --> 00:29:57,948
so, like, I mean,
can you even imagine

592
00:29:57,981 --> 00:29:59,283
what that's like for him?

593
00:29:59,316 --> 00:30:00,484
Things like this
are bound to happen.

594
00:30:00,517 --> 00:30:02,152
Of course.

595
00:30:02,186 --> 00:30:04,521
However, we think some time
off of school would be best.

596
00:30:04,556 --> 00:30:06,523
Right, for the school, maybe.

597
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:08,192
So wait, your guys'
way to deal with it

598
00:30:08,225 --> 00:30:10,260
is to not deal with it,
that's awesome.

599
00:30:10,294 --> 00:30:12,296
Awesome system you got going on.

600
00:30:12,329 --> 00:30:13,598
You guys teach kids,
you know that, right?

00:30:13,631 --> 00:30:15,099
There's no need to yell.

602
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,940

603
00:30:22,973 --> 00:30:24,975

604
00:30:25,008 --> 00:30:26,143
Yeah, I got nothing.

605

I'm just curious,

been my go-to move.

I give you that.

Mommy always used
to put them in my lunchbox.

Why don't you ask
your mom to get you some?

You can't take a bathtub

You can't just come around here

What can I do then, huh?

668

understand; I don't know why...

He just wanted pudding.

672

He wants something
new every week, Jane.

673
00:33:17,247 --> 00:33:19,116
He wanted a pony last week.

674
00:33:19,149 --> 00:33:20,652
Well, this isn't a pony.
It's the pudding.

675

It's the pudding that
she put in his lunch box.

- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

697
00:34:11,234 --> 00:34:12,604
Happy Friday.

698
00:34:12,637 --> 00:34:13,838
Fuck Friday.
What are you drinking?

699
00:34:13,871 --> 00:34:15,372
- A whiskey ginger.
- Awesome.

700
00:34:15,405 --> 00:34:16,540
[bartender] There you go.
What can I get you?

701
00:34:16,574 --> 00:34:17,709
- Mm.
- Okay?

702
00:34:17,742 --> 00:34:18,943
I hate whiskey.

703
00:34:18,977 --> 00:34:20,544
Hi, Jane.

704
00:34:20,578 --> 00:34:21,746
Oh, shit.

705
00:34:21,779 --> 00:34:23,213
I haven't seen them since...

706
00:34:23,246 --> 00:34:24,448
The night you
broke up with me.

707
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:26,084
- Yeah, this is gonna be weird.
- Yeah.

708
00:34:26,116 --> 00:34:27,952
Oh no, it's been a long time.

709
00:34:27,986 --> 00:34:29,386
- She'll be fine.
- [sighs]

710
00:34:29,419 --> 00:34:30,855
- Come on.
- Okay.

711
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:34,926
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, girl.

712
00:34:34,959 --> 00:34:36,426
Do we know you?

713
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:39,030
Yep, still hate me.

714
00:34:39,063 --> 00:34:41,032
I'm kidding, it's a joke.

715
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:43,735
I'm so sorry about Fi.

716
00:34:43,768 --> 00:34:45,003
Thanks, Suz.

717
00:34:47,772 --> 00:34:49,040
So I'm gonna go... I...

718
00:34:49,073 --> 00:34:50,540
No, hey, come on.

719
00:34:51,009 --> 00:34:52,342
One drink.

720
00:34:54,311 --> 00:34:55,545
Thanks.

721
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,381
So how naked were you?

722
00:34:57,414 --> 00:34:59,050
Because I don't think this has
anything to do with Bailey.

723
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:00,217
[Jane] Wait, what do you mean?

724
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,318
Well, she's a lesbian, right?

725
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:02,587
[Jane] Uh, so?

726
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,254
So let's say Gemma was a man.

727
00:35:04,287 --> 00:35:05,556
Would you have been
that unguarded?

728
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,058
[Jane] With a man, no.

729
00:35:07,091 --> 00:35:08,760
[Suz] Yeah, but she's
attracted to women, right?

730
00:35:08,793 --> 00:35:10,728
I mean perky nipples
through a soaked T-shirt.

731
00:35:10,762 --> 00:35:12,162
- [Paul] Ooh, say more.
- [Suz] No, no, no.

732
00:35:12,195 --> 00:35:13,665
[Alec] On a scale
of one to ten,

733
00:35:13,698 --> 00:35:16,801
ten being the absolute
worst, it's about a six.

734
00:35:16,834 --> 00:35:18,502
[Paul] Need a nanny
for dummies book.

735
00:35:18,535 --> 00:35:20,504
Wow, cheap shot, man.

736
00:35:20,537 --> 00:35:21,739
[Paul] Sorry, lesbian
for dummies.

737
00:35:21,773 --> 00:35:23,407
Paul!

738
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,143
Okay, okay, how about this?

739
00:35:25,175 --> 00:35:27,411
I used to undress in front of Fi
all the time, never an issue.

740
00:35:27,444 --> 00:35:28,813
[Paul] Well that's different.

741
00:35:28,846 --> 00:35:30,480
Lesbians don't have
sex with their friends.

742
00:35:30,514 --> 00:35:32,950
They're far more
intellectualized than that.

743
00:35:32,984 --> 00:35:34,152
Guys, take it
from the lesbian.

744
00:35:34,184 --> 00:35:35,285
[Paul] That's right.
[laughter]

745
00:35:35,318 --> 00:35:36,319
[Jane] Okay, Alec.
Help me out.

746
00:35:36,353 --> 00:35:37,354
You're the professional.

747
00:35:37,387 --> 00:35:38,355
No, I am off the clock.

748
00:35:38,388 --> 00:35:39,791
[Jane] Come on.

749
00:35:39,824 --> 00:35:41,458
I understand why
you did what you did.

750
00:35:41,491 --> 00:35:43,127
[Jane] So why am
I the bad guy?

751
00:35:43,161 --> 00:35:45,529
Because Gemma had no context.

752
00:35:45,563 --> 00:35:47,497
[Suz] How close
are you with Gemma?

753
00:35:47,531 --> 00:35:49,100
I mean, if Fi
and I weren't friends,

754
00:35:49,133 --> 00:35:50,601
I don't think Gemma
and I would be friends.

755
00:35:50,635 --> 00:35:51,836
I don't know; it's a gray area.

756
00:35:51,869 --> 00:35:53,437
Okay, see,
therein lies the conflict.

757
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:54,872
I mean, take Paul for example.

758
00:35:54,906 --> 00:35:57,141
He sleeps with girls
he can't stand.

759
00:35:57,175 --> 00:35:59,977
Oh yeah, there's something
in the aggressive dislike

760
00:36:00,011 --> 00:36:01,445
that turns him on.

761
00:36:01,478 --> 00:36:03,147
Sexual desire
isn't built on love

762
00:36:03,181 --> 00:36:04,381
or the need to build a future.

763
00:36:04,414 --> 00:36:06,383
- Not always.
- Sometimes never.

764
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:08,318
[Jane] Hold on, so you sleep
with people that you hate?

765
00:36:08,351 --> 00:36:09,954
- [Suz laughs]
- I do.

766
00:36:09,987 --> 00:36:11,321
I do do that.

767
00:36:11,354 --> 00:36:13,191
[Jane] You're an honest bunch.

768
00:36:13,223 --> 00:36:14,224
I'm not mad at it.

769
00:36:14,257 --> 00:36:15,793
[all laughing]

770
00:36:15,827 --> 00:36:17,662
This was fun.

771
00:36:17,695 --> 00:36:19,130
Yeah, it was.

772
00:36:19,163 --> 00:36:20,732
Look at you, Alec.

773
00:36:20,765 --> 00:36:22,200
You're a doctor now.

774
00:36:22,232 --> 00:36:24,035
You're a mother fricking doctor.

775
00:36:24,068 --> 00:36:25,970
That's cool; you're cool.

776
00:36:26,003 --> 00:36:28,005
And some would say sexy even.

777
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:31,576
When Fi became a mom,
what did I become?

778
00:36:32,509 --> 00:36:34,212
Still figuring it out.

779
00:36:34,244 --> 00:36:37,514
Well, yeah, but there's
nothing sexy about that.

780
00:36:37,547 --> 00:36:39,316
[both laughing gently]

781
00:36:45,288 --> 00:36:47,759
[Jane sighing]

782
00:36:54,632 --> 00:36:56,701
[Gemma] <i>Hi Jane, it's Gemma.</i>

783
00:36:56,734 --> 00:36:59,436
<i>I've decided to hire
a professional babysitter.</i>

784
00:36:59,469 --> 00:37:02,874
<i>Thank you for your help
the last couple of months.</i>

785
00:37:02,907 --> 00:37:04,976
<i>I hope you have a good day.
Bye.</i>

[gentle guitar music]

787
00:37:16,286 --> 00:37:17,354
Hey, girl.

788
00:37:17,387 --> 00:37:20,524
Hey... Hannah.

789
00:37:21,491 --> 00:37:23,861
- How's life?
- Never been better, you?

790
00:37:23,895 --> 00:37:25,529
Oh, my God, me too.

791
00:37:25,563 --> 00:37:27,031
It's crazy, right?

792
00:37:27,064 --> 00:37:28,566
Are you gonna be
around this weekend?

793
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:30,134
Can't imagine
where else I'd be.

794
00:37:30,168 --> 00:37:32,302
Oh my God, yes.

795
00:37:32,335 --> 00:37:34,238
Do you think you could
water my indoor plants?

796
00:37:34,272 --> 00:37:36,641
I'm going home for a week,
slash Sundays for Passover,

797
00:37:36,674 --> 00:37:38,441
slash my sister's having a baby.

798
00:37:38,475 --> 00:37:40,477
I could leave a key for you.

799
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,546
- Wait, it's Passover?
- Today.

800
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,148
Like today, today?

801
00:37:44,182 --> 00:37:45,348
Uh-huh.

802
00:37:54,292 --> 00:37:56,561
Pick a lane,
any lane, pick it.

803
00:37:56,594 --> 00:37:57,762
Oh, you're not gonna
use your blinker.

804
00:37:57,795 --> 00:37:59,130
Oh, that's great,
that's smart,

805
00:37:59,163 --> 00:38:00,832
'cause you know
that's not for you, right?

806
00:38:03,301 --> 00:38:06,336
[music continues]

807
00:38:10,507 --> 00:38:11,709
Hey.

808
00:38:13,711 --> 00:38:15,012
What are you doing here?

809
00:38:15,046 --> 00:38:16,513
You weren't returning
my messages,

810
00:38:16,546 --> 00:38:19,784
so I made you this;
it's a Ruth survival kit.

811
00:38:19,817 --> 00:38:21,518
It's got Advil

814
00:38:25,522 --> 00:38:27,424
It's stupid, I didn't...
oh, just take it.

815
00:38:27,457 --> 00:38:28,559
[Bailey] Jane's coming?

816
00:38:29,227 --> 00:38:32,997
Oh, B-boy.
[groans]

817
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,832
Get in here, hi.

818
00:38:34,866 --> 00:38:37,201
Jane, you know how
I always tell you my dreams,

819
00:38:37,235 --> 00:38:38,603
but you haven't been here,

820
00:38:38,636 --> 00:38:40,271
so I have all these
dreams to tell you.

821
00:38:40,304 --> 00:38:41,639
- Do you want to hear one?
- Absolutely.

822
00:38:41,672 --> 00:38:43,040
I have so many dreams
to tell you too.

823
00:38:43,074 --> 00:38:44,342
Get in the car.
You can tell Jane on the way.

824
00:38:44,374 --> 00:38:45,776
- Come on!
- What?

825
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:47,111
- Come on.
- Go get your bag.

826
00:38:47,144 --> 00:38:48,980
- Come on!
- I don't have a bag; how did...

827
00:38:49,013 --> 00:38:50,147
- Get your bag.
- How did you know?

828
00:38:50,181 --> 00:38:51,682
Okay.
You're good.

829
00:38:51,716 --> 00:38:52,950
You're coming with us.
We're stealing with you.

830
00:38:52,984 --> 00:38:54,151
Okay, all right,
you can steal me.

831
00:38:54,185 --> 00:38:55,186
- [Bailey] Come on Jane!
- Hold on!

832
00:38:55,219 --> 00:38:56,587
- [Bailey] Hurry up!
- Okay.

833
00:38:58,388 --> 00:38:59,891
- [Bailey] J-dog?
- [laughs]

834
00:38:59,924 --> 00:39:02,293
I'm coming.
Get in your seat and buckle up.

[music fades out]

837
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,881
That was
the second worst dinner

838
00:39:23,915 --> 00:39:25,349
I've ever had ever.

839
00:39:25,383 --> 00:39:28,152
- Bailey.
- In my whole life, what?

840
00:39:28,185 --> 00:39:29,687
What do you expect?

841
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,323
You two never introduced
him to anything kosher.

842
00:39:32,356 --> 00:39:34,491
Hey, Bailey,
show Bubbe your lizard.

843
00:39:34,524 --> 00:39:37,161
Gemma, you did not bring
a lizard into this house.

844
00:39:37,194 --> 00:39:38,629
[Gemma and Jane]
It's imaginary.

845
00:39:40,298 --> 00:39:42,833
Well, I would love
to meet him.

846
00:39:44,635 --> 00:39:47,238
He's in my backpack
and doesn't want to come out.

847
00:39:48,205 --> 00:39:52,076
Oh, that's nice,
sweetheart, that's nice.

848
00:39:53,244 --> 00:39:55,880
The most important thing
to me is that Bailey

849
00:39:55,913 --> 00:39:57,615
gets that money that
is in a trust fund...

850
00:39:57,648 --> 00:39:59,684
- This is all pretty standard.
- And that it's safe in there.

851
00:39:59,717 --> 00:40:01,085
I'm aware,
so I completely understand.

852

where to sign, I can.

00:40:45,796 --> 00:40:47,465
You getting in?

871
00:40:47,497 --> 00:40:48,766
Thinking about it.

872
00:40:48,799 --> 00:40:51,302
[both laughing]

873
00:40:51,335 --> 00:40:53,404
- Here.
- Ugh, thank you.

874
00:40:54,472 --> 00:40:55,873
How's it going in there?

875
00:40:55,906 --> 00:40:57,341
- Uh...
- You okay?

876
00:40:57,375 --> 00:40:58,809
[Gemma sighs]

877
00:40:58,843 --> 00:41:00,811
[Jane] Ah.
[laughs]

878
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:07,218
Can I ask you something?

879
00:41:08,886 --> 00:41:11,288
And I just want you to be
totally honest with me.

880
00:41:11,322 --> 00:41:14,425
I'm not gonna get all Gemma
on you or anything.

881
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:21,165
Am I failing him?

882
00:41:21,198 --> 00:41:23,267
[soft, emotional music]

883
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,402
How so?

884
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:30,074
I don't know how to love him
through all of this.

885
00:41:32,143 --> 00:41:34,912
Like, I look at him
and I just see her.

886
00:41:38,582 --> 00:41:40,184
You know, she made
it look so easy

887
00:41:42,053 --> 00:41:43,521
and it's...

888
00:41:44,155 --> 00:41:45,389
it's not.

889
00:41:47,825 --> 00:41:49,460
It's really not.

890
00:41:51,695 --> 00:41:55,132
And, like, I know that I'm
letting him down, you know?

891
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:01,839
I don't know how to change it.

892
00:42:01,872 --> 00:42:04,909
[music continues]

893
00:42:13,584 --> 00:42:16,120
Do everything
you can to make it right.

894
00:42:18,355 --> 00:42:22,293
Even if you make it wrong,
keep trying, right?

895
00:42:24,595 --> 00:42:26,664
How did she do what she did?

896
00:42:28,032 --> 00:42:30,768
Like what, her being her?

897
00:42:30,801 --> 00:42:33,938
Yeah, that.

898
00:42:36,807 --> 00:42:37,975
I don't know.

899
00:42:40,377 --> 00:42:43,614
She had this way
of making you feel safe,

900
00:42:44,949 --> 00:42:47,751
like she was shielding you
from the outside world.

901
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:54,625
Who was shielding her?

902
00:42:56,794 --> 00:42:58,095
I thought I was.

903
00:42:58,963 --> 00:43:00,498
Yeah.

904
00:43:02,466 --> 00:43:03,534
Me too.

905
00:43:10,274 --> 00:43:11,442
Sorry.

906
00:43:13,277 --> 00:43:15,946
Thank you so much for
helping out with Bailey.

907
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,715
- He's finally down.
- Yeah.

908
00:43:17,748 --> 00:43:18,949
Yeah, no problem.

909
00:43:25,489 --> 00:43:27,424
I'm really sorry you
have to sleep down there.

910
00:43:27,458 --> 00:43:29,126
That can't be comfortable.

911
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,296
Oh, it's not,
but I have survived worse.

912
00:43:45,776 --> 00:43:47,144
You know what?

913
00:43:51,482 --> 00:43:53,083
Yes!

914
00:43:53,851 --> 00:43:55,152
Let's see.

915
00:43:55,654 --> 00:43:56,754
Oh, yeah.

916
00:43:56,787 --> 00:43:57,855
[Gemma] Oh, my God.

917
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:00,625
I wonder if it's still hits.

918
00:44:00,659 --> 00:44:02,693
Is that joint
from high school?

919
00:44:06,797 --> 00:44:08,299
[Jane coughing]

920
00:44:08,332 --> 00:44:09,333
Shh!

921
00:44:09,366 --> 00:44:11,670
[Jane laughing]

922
00:44:11,702 --> 00:44:14,338
It still hits.
It's nasty though.

923
00:44:14,371 --> 00:44:15,906
It's really nasty.
[laughs]

924
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,174
[Gemma] Okay.

925
00:44:23,881 --> 00:44:25,115
Wow.

926
00:44:28,219 --> 00:44:30,988
Ruth is definitely
gonna smell that.

927
00:44:31,021 --> 00:44:32,557
What's she gonna do,
ground us?

928
00:44:35,226 --> 00:44:37,094
God damn, I miss her so much.

929
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:40,699
Me too.

930
00:44:41,666 --> 00:44:43,200
I miss her every day.

931
00:44:45,836 --> 00:44:47,037
Me too.

932
00:44:52,743 --> 00:44:54,445
I don't wanna cry again.

933
00:44:55,846 --> 00:44:56,981
That's okay.

934
00:44:59,083 --> 00:45:01,385
- [Gemma] Do you cry?
- [scoffs]

935
00:45:04,121 --> 00:45:05,322
No.

936
00:45:06,357 --> 00:45:07,458
Why?

937
00:45:13,632 --> 00:45:15,065
'Cause I won't stop.

938
00:45:17,868 --> 00:45:19,604
That's why I can't start.

939
00:45:26,243 --> 00:45:27,478
Scoot over.

940
00:45:40,424 --> 00:45:42,661
[Gemma sighs]

941
00:45:48,132 --> 00:45:50,301
I'm so mad at her, Jane.

942
00:45:53,437 --> 00:45:55,607
Like, I am so mad.

943
00:45:58,809 --> 00:46:01,713
Sometimes I feel that more
than I feel anything else.

944
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:32,142
[gentle music]

945
00:47:18,389 --> 00:47:19,423
Show me.

946
00:47:38,242 --> 00:47:41,245
[music fades out]

947
00:47:44,181 --> 00:47:45,750
- Dragon's dead.
- What?

948
00:47:45,784 --> 00:47:47,752
- [Jane] What?
- He's dead; he's gone.

949
00:47:47,786 --> 00:47:49,253
No, no, no, I just saw him.

950
00:47:49,286 --> 00:47:51,021
He came in here
and he was happy.

951
00:47:51,054 --> 00:47:52,189
You're lying.

952
00:47:52,222 --> 00:47:53,591
I got up and he was dead.

953
00:47:53,625 --> 00:47:54,958
Shh.

954
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:56,594
What's going on?

955
00:47:56,628 --> 00:48:00,097
His lizard died,
his imaginary lizard.

956
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:03,033
- Oh, my goodness.
- It's okay.

957
00:48:03,066 --> 00:48:04,836
It's okay, it's okay.

958
00:48:06,905 --> 00:48:08,038
It's okay.

959
00:48:08,071 --> 00:48:09,473
[Gemma] It's okay, sweetie.

960
00:48:21,586 --> 00:48:24,288
Mom, you have
to say those words.

961
00:48:24,321 --> 00:48:25,489
About Dragon?

962
00:48:30,227 --> 00:48:34,531
Dragon, thank you
for being such a good pet.

963
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,036
You were the bestest.

964
00:48:40,672 --> 00:48:43,140
And we hope you're
happy wherever you are.

965
00:48:46,343 --> 00:48:47,812
- Bubbe?
- Hm?

966
00:48:47,846 --> 00:48:49,614
[Bailey] Can we do
that dirt thing now?

967
00:48:49,647 --> 00:48:50,882
Of course, honey.

968
00:48:53,317 --> 00:48:56,353
[gentle music]

969
00:49:31,288 --> 00:49:32,991
[Gemma] Alec, no, he didn't
say how he died,

970
00:49:33,023 --> 00:49:34,358
just that he died.

971
00:49:35,392 --> 00:49:37,461
I don't... I don't...

972
00:49:37,494 --> 00:49:39,263
Jane, do you know
when Bailey got the lizard?

973
00:49:39,296 --> 00:49:42,266
Oh, I met Dragon when I first
picked him up from school.

974
00:49:42,299 --> 00:49:44,535
Okay, so it was,
like, six months ago.

975
00:49:44,569 --> 00:49:46,036
I think he needs
a better therapist.

976
00:49:46,069 --> 00:49:47,204
- No, Alec's good.
- No, I did.

977
00:49:47,237 --> 00:49:48,472
- Trust me.
- I started him

978
00:49:48,505 --> 00:49:49,473
on the low dose
like two weeks ago.

979
00:49:49,506 --> 00:49:50,507
Wait, low dose?

980
00:49:50,541 --> 00:49:51,809
What low dose?

981
00:49:51,843 --> 00:49:53,110
[Gemma sighs]
Okay, all right.

982
00:49:53,143 --> 00:49:54,344
Thank you, Alec.

983
00:49:55,747 --> 00:49:57,147
What did he say to do?

984
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:58,850
You put him on the meds?

985
00:49:58,883 --> 00:50:00,284
What did he say to do?

986
00:50:00,317 --> 00:50:03,387
Alec thinks that this
is normal behavior,

987
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:05,155
considering the circumstances,

988
00:50:05,188 --> 00:50:07,157
and he's going to bring
it up in his next session.

989
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:08,693
Okay, and the meds?

990
00:50:08,726 --> 00:50:10,394
- What meds?
- Yes, Jane.

991
00:50:10,427 --> 00:50:12,362
I thought that it was a good
idea to start him on the meds.

992
00:50:12,396 --> 00:50:13,798
What meds?

993
00:50:15,065 --> 00:50:16,500
Bailey has ADHD.

994
00:50:16,533 --> 00:50:19,536
- [Bailey] Mom?
- Bailey doesn't have that.

995
00:50:19,571 --> 00:50:21,405
- He's rambunctious.
- Well Alec thinks...

996
00:50:21,438 --> 00:50:23,708
That's not clinical.
That's a typical seven year old.

997
00:50:23,741 --> 00:50:25,509
Alec thinks that it's
going to level him out, Ruth.

998
00:50:25,542 --> 00:50:28,245
I cannot believe he
would do that to a child.

999
00:50:28,278 --> 00:50:29,914
It was recommended.

1000
00:50:29,948 --> 00:50:32,082
Numbing him?
All that's gonna do is help you.

1001
00:50:32,115 --> 00:50:34,284
Ruth, that's not fair, okay?

1002
00:50:36,219 --> 00:50:39,591
Parents drug up their children
to make their own lives easier.

1003
00:50:39,624 --> 00:50:41,158
- Mom!
- Fiona would never

1004
00:50:41,191 --> 00:50:42,326
have done that.

1005
00:50:43,393 --> 00:50:46,064
Wow, Ruth, you are
being unreasonable.

1006
00:50:46,096 --> 00:50:47,765
Oh, and what you're
doing is any better?

1007
00:50:47,799 --> 00:50:49,333
You're kidding
yourself if you think

1008
00:50:49,366 --> 00:50:51,234
you're all of a sudden gay;
give me a break.

1009
00:50:51,268 --> 00:50:52,302
Wait, what?

1010
00:50:52,937 --> 00:50:54,606
Janie, I see
everything you're doing

1011
00:50:54,639 --> 00:50:57,041
to make this family
stay together,

1012
00:50:57,075 --> 00:50:58,676
but Bailey's life
is upside down.

1013
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:00,044
This is gonna make
it a whole lot worse.

1014
00:51:00,078 --> 00:51:01,511
I would never do anything
to hurt him...

1015
00:51:01,545 --> 00:51:03,246
And if you ever smoke
dope in my house again,

1016
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,582
you will not be welcome back.

1017
00:51:04,616 --> 00:51:05,917
Yeah, you think that
was the first time.

1018
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:07,250
Come on, Ruth.
You're smarter than that.

1019
00:51:07,284 --> 00:51:08,452
[Ruth] So are you.

1020
00:51:12,289 --> 00:51:15,325
[gentle music]

1021
00:51:17,461 --> 00:51:22,165
So, in light
of Dragon's death...

1022
00:51:23,635 --> 00:51:26,771
maybe you could come back
and help us out a little bit.

1023
00:51:26,804 --> 00:51:30,340
I mean, if you even want to,
or if you even can.

1024
00:51:30,374 --> 00:51:32,275
I don't know what
you have going on.

1025
00:51:32,309 --> 00:51:33,811
Yeah, no, yeah.

1026
00:51:33,845 --> 00:51:36,546
I can pick him up tomorrow
and take him to therapy.

1027
00:51:36,581 --> 00:51:37,915
Thanks.

1028
00:51:37,949 --> 00:51:39,282
Thanks, Jane.

1029
00:51:45,255 --> 00:51:46,223
And Jane, I...

1030
00:51:46,256 --> 00:51:47,491
Are we home yet?

1031
00:51:48,793 --> 00:51:50,293
Yes, sweetheart.

1032
00:51:50,327 --> 00:51:51,729
[Jane] I'm gonna go.

1033
00:51:51,763 --> 00:51:53,564
- You good?
- [Gemma] Yeah.

1034
00:51:53,598 --> 00:51:56,134
Okay, awesome.
[laughs]

1035
00:51:56,166 --> 00:51:57,367
Yeah, you too.

1036
00:51:58,836 --> 00:52:00,303
- Bye.
- [Gemma] Bye.

00:52:31,535 --> 00:52:33,004
Vanessa, is that all right?

1048
00:52:34,839 --> 00:52:36,774
Uh-huh.
Um...

1049
00:52:37,507 --> 00:52:39,376
Holy shit.

1050
00:52:39,409 --> 00:52:41,646
I'm only telling you because I
need your professional opinion.

1051
00:52:41,679 --> 00:52:44,882
[laughs]
Well as your friend, holy shit.

1052
00:52:44,916 --> 00:52:47,384
Okay, but like, what do I do?

1053
00:52:47,417 --> 00:52:49,352
As a therapist,
tell me as a therapist,

1054
00:52:49,386 --> 00:52:51,321
and I know, I know,
I know that you're like,

1055
00:52:51,354 --> 00:52:52,890
"It's unethical Jane, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah,"

1056
00:52:52,924 --> 00:52:55,893
but, like, seriously,
I've no idea what I'm doing.

1057
00:52:55,927 --> 00:52:57,995
Tell me what to do,
and I'll literally... I'll do it.

1058
00:52:58,029 --> 00:53:00,430
Here's a question for you.
Did you enjoy it?

1059
00:53:04,602 --> 00:53:06,470
Well, don't give me that look.

1060
00:53:06,503 --> 00:53:10,808
Sorry, yeah, I just...
I did not see this coming, okay? Um...

1061
00:53:10,842 --> 00:53:12,677
Am I like a lesbian?

1062
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:15,245
Can it switch like that?

1063
00:53:15,278 --> 00:53:16,914
I don't think you
have to label it.

1064
00:53:16,948 --> 00:53:18,983
Well, you labeled Bailey ADHD.

1065
00:53:19,016 --> 00:53:21,753
That's an actual disorder
with criteria for diagnosis.

1066
00:53:21,786 --> 00:53:23,420
Then give me
your professional diagnosis.

1067
00:53:23,453 --> 00:53:25,089
There's nothing to diagnose.

1068
00:53:25,123 --> 00:53:27,491
You're exploring bisexuality.

1069
00:53:27,524 --> 00:53:29,160
No, that's gray area.

1070
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,429
Could this be like
a symptom of something bigger?

1071
00:53:32,462 --> 00:53:35,833
Sexuality isn't a symptom;
it's a human experience.

1072
00:53:35,867 --> 00:53:37,769
I need more, okay?

1073
00:53:43,507 --> 00:53:45,877
Fi used to help me out
with this kind of shit.

1074
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:47,377
[gentle music]

1075
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:49,747
I can't... I can't go it alone.

1076
00:53:49,781 --> 00:53:52,516
I mean, you think I wanna
be asking <i>you</i> for advice?

1077
00:53:54,152 --> 00:53:56,220
At some point in my stupid life,

1078
00:53:56,254 --> 00:54:01,324
I forgot to make friends,
and forgot to, like, date.

1079
00:54:04,929 --> 00:54:06,030
I hear you.

1080
00:54:07,098 --> 00:54:08,866
Do you?

1081
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:11,636
Are you sure you aren't
interested in talking to someone?

1082
00:54:11,669 --> 00:54:13,070
It's obviously up to you,

1083
00:54:13,104 --> 00:54:14,538
but I think it
would be beneficial.

1084
00:54:14,572 --> 00:54:15,873
There's a lot to unpack here.

1085
00:54:15,907 --> 00:54:17,440
Then start unpacking.

1086
00:54:18,441 --> 00:54:19,710
Sorry, Alec.

1087
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:24,215
Please... give me something.

1088
00:54:25,448 --> 00:54:30,922
Maybe you slept with her because
you really miss Fi; you both do.

1089
00:54:30,955 --> 00:54:32,824
It was a very...

1090
00:54:36,127 --> 00:54:37,728
Gemma's a part of Fi for you,

1091
00:54:38,796 --> 00:54:41,098
and you're a part
of Fi for Gemma,

1092
00:54:41,132 --> 00:54:42,834
so you two had each other.

1093
00:54:42,867 --> 00:54:44,569
So you're saying
I'm not a lesbian?

1094
00:54:44,602 --> 00:54:46,771
[laughs]
Come on, Jane.

1095
00:54:46,804 --> 00:54:50,540
I can't define that for you.

1096
00:54:50,575 --> 00:54:52,310
You might just have
to be okay with that.

1097
00:54:52,342 --> 00:54:54,779
Oh, that's asking me
to do the impossible.

1098
00:54:54,812 --> 00:54:57,281
Oh yeah, well,
that is my specialty:

1099
00:54:57,315 --> 00:54:59,482
taking the impossible,
making it possible.

1100
00:55:00,952 --> 00:55:02,153
You're welcome.

1101
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:10,061
You're a good friend,
and, like, an okay therapist.

1102
00:55:11,494 --> 00:55:14,531
[upbeat pop music]

1103
00:55:19,303 --> 00:55:20,537
[door opens]

1104
00:55:20,571 --> 00:55:22,039
Hey, Gem.

1105
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:24,141
You didn't have to do that.

1106
00:55:24,175 --> 00:55:26,509
Oh no, I know.
I wanted to.

1107
00:55:26,543 --> 00:55:28,613
And there's also,
like, a warm plate

1108
00:55:28,646 --> 00:55:30,681
of food in the oven,
if you want it.

1109
00:55:30,715 --> 00:55:31,849
Thank you.

1110
00:55:32,917 --> 00:55:34,719
How was your day, sweetheart?
[laughs]

1111
00:55:34,752 --> 00:55:36,053
Kidding, sorry.

1112
00:55:36,087 --> 00:55:38,289
Don't mean sweetheart.
That's weird.

1113
00:55:38,322 --> 00:55:40,390
It was a long day, darling.

1114
00:55:42,159 --> 00:55:45,395
The partners are just waiting
for me to make a mistake,

1115
00:55:45,428 --> 00:55:47,598
just to prove I'm off my game,

1116
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,968
and it's really exhausting.

1117
00:55:51,002 --> 00:55:52,570
I can imagine.

1118
00:55:52,603 --> 00:55:55,306
It's sometimes how I feel
when you get all Gem on me.

1119
00:55:56,107 --> 00:55:57,375
Really?

1120
00:55:59,277 --> 00:56:01,212
It's the last thing
I want you to feel.

1121
00:56:02,512 --> 00:56:05,316
I mean, I don't... I don't
take it personally or anything.

1122
00:56:17,128 --> 00:56:20,932
I was thinking I could
maybe stay the night?

1123
00:56:23,301 --> 00:56:24,434
Yeah.

1124
00:56:25,403 --> 00:56:27,004
Was kind of hoping
you'd say that.

1125
00:56:27,038 --> 00:56:28,205
[Jane sighs]

[together] One, two, three!

1128

[Bailey] We made it for you.

1129
00:57:15,485 --> 00:57:17,888
It's called Dragon's Looming.

1130
00:57:30,701 --> 00:57:32,570
Oh, man.
I forgot to bring a book.

1131
00:57:32,603 --> 00:57:34,472
You wanna read to me?

1132
00:57:34,504 --> 00:57:35,639
I'm not reading to you.

1133
00:57:35,673 --> 00:57:36,907
Oh, why?
Too romantic?

1134
00:57:36,941 --> 00:57:37,942
Absolutely.

indistinctly]

1137

He'll bite your hand off.

Never touch shark.
He lives under the monkey bars.

He'll eat you and your parrot.

Hey, I wanna jump, hey.

1141
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:51,022
Hey, you have to share!

1142

- Ow, stop.
- Watch out.

1143
00:57:52,156 --> 00:57:53,657
This is a park for sharing.

1144

- Ow!
- B-boy, ease up.

1145
00:57:56,027 --> 00:57:57,862
- Let me try.
- No!

1146

- Bailey!
- This hurts.

1147
00:57:59,163 --> 00:58:01,265
B-boy, not cool,
man, not cool.

00:58:02,967 --> 00:58:04,035
Ow, get off!

1150
00:58:04,068 --> 00:58:05,603
Bailey, hey!

1151
00:58:05,636 --> 00:58:07,505
- We're playing.
- That is enough.

1152
00:58:07,537 --> 00:58:09,440
- We were playing.
- We are leaving.

1153
00:58:09,473 --> 00:58:10,841
Hold on, hold on.

1154
00:58:10,875 --> 00:58:11,976
Can't he just take
a timeout or something?

1155
00:58:12,009 --> 00:58:13,577
Yeah, timeout.

1156
00:58:14,412 --> 00:58:16,013
I am trying to teach
him a lesson here.

1157
00:58:16,047 --> 00:58:18,282
Yeah, but you're being
a little harsh, don't you think?

1158
00:58:20,718 --> 00:58:21,786
What?

1159
00:58:21,819 --> 00:58:22,887

me to read to you.

Am I done with timeout yet?

Listen, there are boundaries.

I'm literally just doing
what Fi would have done.

1168
00:58:44,442 --> 00:58:45,676
Exactly.

1169
00:58:45,709 --> 00:58:47,311
That's why
it's so weird, okay?

1170
00:58:55,753 --> 00:58:57,254
What are we doing?

1171
00:58:59,423 --> 00:59:00,658
Should we stop?

1172
00:59:08,232 --> 00:59:11,102
If that's what you want,
you have to say it to my face.

1173
00:59:17,775 --> 00:59:18,909
Me neither.

1174
00:59:22,413 --> 00:59:27,118
Do you ever think about her
when we're together?

1175
00:59:27,151 --> 00:59:29,854
Like think, think about her.

1176
00:59:29,887 --> 00:59:32,189
I think about
her all the time...

1177
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:39,697
but no, not like that
when we're together, no.

1178
00:59:39,730 --> 00:59:41,799
Sometimes when I feel happy...

1179
00:59:44,603 --> 00:59:47,705
I feel terrible,

1180
00:59:47,738 --> 00:59:49,807
like we're betraying her.

1181
00:59:54,979 --> 00:59:56,680
Oh, well...

1182
00:59:59,817 --> 01:00:03,555
I mean, if that's
how you feel, then,

1183
01:00:03,588 --> 01:00:05,823
I mean, maybe we should stop.

1184
01:00:05,856 --> 01:00:07,057
No, no, no, no.

1185
01:00:08,859 --> 01:00:10,060
I take it back.

1186
01:00:11,095 --> 01:00:12,997
Go back to bed.

1187
01:00:20,304 --> 01:00:21,438
Are you sure
we have enough space

1188
01:00:21,472 --> 01:00:22,740
in the garage for all this?

1189
01:00:23,642 --> 01:00:25,309

of all this stuff just yet.

Oh, my gosh, Gemma, smell it.

1194
01:00:34,185 --> 01:00:35,352
It smells like her.

[Gemma] You want
to smell, Bailey?

1196
01:00:44,563 --> 01:00:45,930
This one stays.

01:00:47,064 --> 01:00:48,432
So is there anything
in this box

from Paper And Bliss
that you want to keep?

1199
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:51,468
I don't know.
Let me go through it.

1200
01:00:51,502 --> 01:00:52,671

grab some more boxes.

you find these?

1207

There.

1208
01:01:24,268 --> 01:01:26,237
Hey, Gem, can I talk
to you privately?

1209
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:27,738
Yeah, sure.
What's up?

1210
01:01:27,771 --> 01:01:30,709
Bailey, go play
in the living room, okay?

1211
01:01:30,741 --> 01:01:32,276
Yeah, but I wanna
be here with you.

1212
01:01:32,309 --> 01:01:33,744
Hey bud, ten minutes,
and then you can come back.

1213
01:01:33,777 --> 01:01:35,079
I promise, okay?

1214
01:01:41,051 --> 01:01:42,853
Babe, you're freaking me out.

1215
01:01:42,886 --> 01:01:45,389
Fi was on anti-depressants?

1216
01:01:45,422 --> 01:01:47,057
What?

1217
01:01:47,091 --> 01:01:48,525
Where'd you get these?

1218
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:50,461
Bailey found 'em over there.
Was she depressed?

1219
01:01:53,632 --> 01:01:55,866
I mean, I didn't even
know she was taking these.

1220
01:01:55,899 --> 01:01:56,967
You swear?

1221
01:01:57,736 --> 01:01:59,236
Yeah, I swear.

1222
01:01:59,270 --> 01:02:01,538
Were you guys, like, having
problems or something?

1223
01:02:01,573 --> 01:02:04,408
[Gemma] I'm sorry.
What are you saying right now?

1224
01:02:04,441 --> 01:02:05,909
Why would Alec
prescribe these to her?

1225
01:02:05,943 --> 01:02:07,612
Fi was a little bit
stressed out.

1226
01:02:07,646 --> 01:02:09,446
I mean, I wouldn't say
that she was depressed.

1227
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,782
She was stressed out?
She didn't seem stressed out to me.

1228
01:02:11,815 --> 01:02:13,951
Yeah, well we were trying
to have another baby.

1229
01:02:13,984 --> 01:02:15,853
A second baby?

1230
01:02:15,886 --> 01:02:16,954
Yeah.

1231
01:02:16,987 --> 01:02:18,289
[Jane] Since when?

1232
01:02:21,559 --> 01:02:24,094
I mean she did the
insemination two weeks before...

1233
01:02:24,128 --> 01:02:25,462
She never told me that.

1234
01:02:25,496 --> 01:02:26,698
I mean, you don't
need to know everything.

1235
01:02:26,731 --> 01:02:28,265
Why haven't you told me that?

1236
01:02:28,299 --> 01:02:29,967
You don't need to know
everything about our lives.

1237
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,569
You don't know everything
about our relationship...

1238
01:02:31,603 --> 01:02:33,871
Yeah, but you're supposed
to tell me these things.

1239
01:02:33,904 --> 01:02:35,973
I'm supposed to tell you
every detail about my marriage?

1240
01:02:36,006 --> 01:02:37,474
She said that you were
gonna have the next baby.

1241
01:02:37,508 --> 01:02:38,710
Wasn't that the plan?

1242
01:02:40,811 --> 01:02:44,915
Well, we tried,
and it didn't take.

1243
01:02:44,948 --> 01:02:47,117
Did you force her
to have the second child?

1244
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,422
[laughs dryly]

1245
01:02:51,455 --> 01:02:53,157
I didn't force her
to do anything.

1246
01:02:53,190 --> 01:02:55,760
Are you sure?
Because maybe she wasn't ready.

1247
01:02:55,794 --> 01:02:56,960
[Gemma] We were ready...

1248
01:02:56,994 --> 01:02:58,128
Yeah, but you're not the one

1249
01:02:58,162 --> 01:02:59,229
that has to have
the baby, right?

1250
01:02:59,263 --> 01:03:00,598
Oh, my God!

1251
01:03:00,632 --> 01:03:03,167
She had such a hard
time after Bailey.

1252
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,835
She had PTSD
or whatever that's called.

1253
01:03:04,868 --> 01:03:06,403
- Post-partum?
- Yeah.

1254
01:03:06,437 --> 01:03:07,772
She had that, I'm pretty sure,
right after Bailey.

1255
01:03:07,806 --> 01:03:09,440
So what... what is it
that you're saying?

1256
01:03:09,473 --> 01:03:10,742
- You worked all the time.
- Are you saying that, what?

1257
01:03:10,775 --> 01:03:11,975
Maybe she was
scared, I don't know.

1258
01:03:12,009 --> 01:03:13,110
Are you saying
that it's my fault

1259
01:03:13,143 --> 01:03:14,612
that she killed herself?

1260
01:03:14,646 --> 01:03:17,414
Oh, my God, no, no.
That's not what I'm saying.

1261
01:03:17,448 --> 01:03:19,684
I'm not... sorry, I'm just, like,

1262
01:03:19,718 --> 01:03:21,720
I just need to, like,
think through this.

1263
01:03:23,387 --> 01:03:27,091
So you're saying that you guys
wanted a second baby,

1264
01:03:27,124 --> 01:03:29,661
and that stressed her out so
much that she killed herself?

1265
01:03:29,694 --> 01:03:33,430
No, no, no, that's not Fi.
That's not my Fi.

1266
01:03:33,464 --> 01:03:34,998
Your Fi.

1267
01:03:35,032 --> 01:03:37,901
You know what I mean.
That's not what I'm saying.

1268
01:03:39,069 --> 01:03:41,538
You know what?
She was a little bit hesitant.

1269
01:03:41,573 --> 01:03:42,707
[Jane] Okay.

1270
01:03:43,907 --> 01:03:45,109
[Gemma] Because of you.

1271
01:03:47,311 --> 01:03:48,379
Because of me?

1272
01:03:48,412 --> 01:03:49,880
Okay, yeah, so you're just gonna

1273
01:03:49,913 --> 01:03:52,216
spin it around
on me now, uh-huh.

1274
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:55,352
If the insemination took,
she was going to leave

1275
01:03:55,386 --> 01:03:56,520
Paper And Bliss
and stay home with the kids.

1276
01:03:56,553 --> 01:03:57,789
No, maybe that's
what you wanted,

1277
01:03:57,822 --> 01:03:59,022
but she never would
have done that.

1278
01:03:59,056 --> 01:04:00,357
It wasn't an easy
decision, Jane,

1279
01:04:00,391 --> 01:04:01,626
but you depended on her.

1280
01:04:01,659 --> 01:04:03,127
I would have
been happy for her.

1281
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:04,528
That's why that doesn't
make any sense to me.

1282
01:04:04,562 --> 01:04:06,664
She didn't want
to let you down.

1283
01:04:06,698 --> 01:04:11,135
So you're saying that she
was so worried about me,

1284
01:04:11,168 --> 01:04:14,938
and that depressed her, so she
killed herself because of me?

1285
01:04:19,343 --> 01:04:20,612
I don't know.

1286
01:04:22,246 --> 01:04:23,815
You know what?
I think that's a story

1287
01:04:23,848 --> 01:04:25,983
that you tell yourself;
that doesn't make it true.

1288
01:04:26,016 --> 01:04:27,384
I knew her.

1289
01:04:27,418 --> 01:04:29,520
- Why do you do that?
- Do what?

1290
01:04:29,553 --> 01:04:32,356
You are constantly
competing with me!

1291
01:04:32,389 --> 01:04:34,592
You knew her better,
you two were closer,

1292
01:04:34,626 --> 01:04:35,894
you loved her more.

1293
01:04:35,926 --> 01:04:37,361
Do you know how
ridiculous you sound?

1294
01:04:37,394 --> 01:04:39,564
I have never once
made you feel

1295
01:04:39,597 --> 01:04:41,098
- like I knew her better...
- [Gemma] You constantly do.

1296
01:04:41,131 --> 01:04:42,399
That's not even what
I'm talking about right now.

1297
01:04:42,433 --> 01:04:44,602
And it's hurtful,
and it's childish,

1298
01:04:44,636 --> 01:04:46,170
and it's pointless.

1299
01:04:46,203 --> 01:04:49,506
She was <i>my</i> wife, Jane, <i>my wife!</i>

1300
01:04:53,310 --> 01:04:54,679
I can't go here with you.

1301
01:04:56,447 --> 01:04:58,215
Only when it's
on your terms, right?

1302
01:04:58,248 --> 01:05:00,250
Get the hell out of my house.

1303
01:05:02,152 --> 01:05:03,287
Get out.

1304
01:05:14,097 --> 01:05:16,701

[gentle music]

1306
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,107
Where are you going?

1307
01:05:25,175 --> 01:05:27,311
I just have to go out
for a little bit.

1308
01:05:27,344 --> 01:05:29,881
How long is a little bit?

1309
01:05:29,914 --> 01:05:31,381
Just, like, a little bit.

1310
01:05:31,415 --> 01:05:33,651
I don't want you to go, Mommy.

1311
01:05:35,152 --> 01:05:38,455
Hey.
You know what?

1312
01:05:38,489 --> 01:05:40,825
Your mom asked
if you could go in

1313
01:05:40,859 --> 01:05:42,326
and give her
a really big Bailey hug.

1314
01:05:42,359 --> 01:05:43,895
Can you do that?

1315
01:05:43,928 --> 01:05:45,128
Go do that.

1316
01:05:45,162 --> 01:05:48,198

[indistinct bar chatter]

1338
01:06:50,494 --> 01:06:51,663
- Hey, guys.
- [Alec] Hey.

1339
01:06:51,696 --> 01:06:53,196
- Hey.
- Jane!

1340
01:06:53,230 --> 01:06:55,232
- Whose team am I on?
- Mine, and we are losing.

1341
01:06:55,265 --> 01:06:57,200
- That sounds about right.
- You're up.

1342
01:07:02,774 --> 01:07:04,074
You normally need a plan.

1343
01:07:04,107 --> 01:07:05,542
what ball are you
trying to pocket?

1344
01:07:05,577 --> 01:07:07,411
- All of them.
- It's not how you play.

1345
01:07:07,444 --> 01:07:09,079
Okay, my turn.

1346
01:07:09,781 --> 01:07:11,315
Well...

1347
01:07:12,784 --> 01:07:13,918
Nailed it.

1348
01:07:13,952 --> 01:07:15,720
Wow, okay.

1349
01:07:15,753 --> 01:07:18,022
Wrong ball, but good try.

1350
01:07:18,056 --> 01:07:19,256
Let's see.

1351
01:07:25,563 --> 01:07:27,397
- Jane.
- Why'd you give these to her?

1352
01:07:27,431 --> 01:07:29,232
- Jane, not here.
- Why did you give these to her, Alec?

1353
01:07:29,266 --> 01:07:33,337
Jane, come on, please.
Just come outside, okay?

1354
01:07:33,805 --> 01:07:36,406
Hold on, Alec.
Tell me.

1355
01:07:38,643 --> 01:07:40,510
About a month before she...

1356
01:07:41,746 --> 01:07:44,247
she started seeing me
as a patient.

1357
01:07:44,281 --> 01:07:46,450
She was having trouble
sleeping, some anxiety.

1358
01:07:46,483 --> 01:07:48,218
- Miderol is a common...
- Why didn't you tell me?

1359
01:07:48,251 --> 01:07:49,353
Doctor patient
confidentiality.

1360
01:07:49,386 --> 01:07:51,188
Alec, it's me.

1361
01:07:51,221 --> 01:07:53,024
I followed up with her,
and she thought they were helping.

1362
01:07:53,057 --> 01:07:54,424
Okay,
what was the exact conversation?

1363
01:07:54,458 --> 01:07:56,027
I don't remember
it word for word.

1364
01:07:56,060 --> 01:07:57,695
- Well then tell me the gist.
- That's basically it.

1365
01:07:57,729 --> 01:07:58,963
What was her tone?

1366
01:07:58,997 --> 01:08:00,464
Her tone, her tone
was calm, casual.

1367
01:08:00,497 --> 01:08:01,899
Okay, but what
about the side effects?

1368
01:08:01,933 --> 01:08:03,367
The most common
set of side effects

1369
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:04,969
of Miderol include loss
of appetite, diarrhea,

1370
01:08:05,003 --> 01:08:06,470
but Miderol might also cause
anger, suicidal thoughts...

1371
01:08:06,503 --> 01:08:08,039
Yeah I know, but
the percentage of suicide

1372
01:08:08,072 --> 01:08:09,574
while taking
antidepressants are slim.

1373
01:08:09,607 --> 01:08:10,808
Slim, but it has happened.

1374
01:08:10,842 --> 01:08:12,577
There's always
two sides, Jane.

1375
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:14,078
Millions of people
take them and it helps.

1376
01:08:14,112 --> 01:08:16,114
There are people
killing themselves...

1377
01:08:16,146 --> 01:08:17,481
- Why do you think she did it?
- That if they had access to medicine...

1378
01:08:17,514 --> 01:08:19,316
- What do you think happened?
- And therapy.

1379
01:08:19,349 --> 01:08:21,085
I've prescribed them
to many of my patients,

1380
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:23,320
- and it has been proven...
- God Alec, please, please.

1381
01:08:23,353 --> 01:08:26,289
As my friend, tell me
your honest opinion.

1382
01:08:26,323 --> 01:08:29,159
I won't get mad, okay?
I just... I need to know.

1383
01:08:29,192 --> 01:08:30,962
Could these pills
have caused it?

1384
01:08:33,296 --> 01:08:34,799
Uh...

1385
01:08:37,334 --> 01:08:38,603
There's always a chance that

1386
01:08:38,636 --> 01:08:39,904
the chemicals
in the brain don't...

1387
01:08:39,937 --> 01:08:41,139
If you knew that...
if you knew that,

1388
01:08:41,171 --> 01:08:42,172
then why did you
let this happen?

1389
01:08:42,205 --> 01:08:43,507
Why did you risk it?

1390
01:08:46,778 --> 01:08:48,646
- I wanted to tell you, I...
- What?

1391
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:50,148
Stop crying, stop it.

1392
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:51,616
- You don't get to cry.
- I'm sorry, Jane,

1393
01:08:51,649 --> 01:08:54,585
Jane, I wanted to tell you,
I'm sorry, okay?

1394
01:08:54,619 --> 01:08:56,020
Had I known that
she was suicidal,

1395
01:08:56,054 --> 01:08:57,287
- I would have treated...
- Isn't that your job

1396
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:58,488
- to know though?
- I'm a completely...

1397
01:08:58,522 --> 01:08:59,691
- Stop crying!
- I'm trying, please.

1398
01:08:59,724 --> 01:09:01,159
- Jane, Jane.
- Don't touch me, stop!

1399
01:09:10,001 --> 01:09:11,936
I want to sue Alec.

1400
01:09:11,969 --> 01:09:13,370
- Jane.
- We can do that, right?

1401
01:09:13,403 --> 01:09:15,272
[Gemma] We wouldn't be
suing Alec.

1402
01:09:15,305 --> 01:09:17,942
We'd be going up against
the pharmaceutical company.

1403
01:09:19,010 --> 01:09:21,278
They're ready
for lawsuits like that.

1404
01:09:21,311 --> 01:09:22,880
Our lawyers would likely spin it

1405
01:09:22,914 --> 01:09:25,382
so that our relationship
was the cause of Fi's suicide.

1406
01:09:25,415 --> 01:09:27,051
But we weren't
even together then.

1407
01:09:27,085 --> 01:09:28,552
It doesn't matter.

1408
01:09:30,154 --> 01:09:32,557
They'll do anything to keep
their side of the street clean.

1409
01:09:32,590 --> 01:09:33,891
But...

1410
01:09:33,925 --> 01:09:35,358
I have to get up early.

1411
01:09:37,829 --> 01:09:39,564
[Jane sighs]

1412
01:09:43,735 --> 01:09:44,969
[door thuds]

1413
01:09:45,002 --> 01:09:46,604
[Jane screams]

1414
01:09:56,781 --> 01:09:58,049
How are you feeling?

1415
01:09:58,082 --> 01:09:59,282
Pretty terrible.

1416
01:10:00,417 --> 01:10:01,551
I'm running late.

1417
01:10:03,187 --> 01:10:06,157
You're acting like yesterday
didn't happen.

1418
01:10:06,190 --> 01:10:08,059
Oh, it happened.

1419
01:10:09,761 --> 01:10:11,328
Talk about it later, okay?

1420
01:10:21,773 --> 01:10:24,008
[Fiona] <i>Oh yeah, I really
like the lavender one.</i>

1421
01:10:24,041 --> 01:10:25,877
- I do too, and I like this one.
- Oh that one's cute too, yeah.

1422
01:10:25,910 --> 01:10:28,378
Oh, oh!
[laughs]

1423
01:10:28,411 --> 01:10:29,546
Fi, Fi...

1424
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:30,715
- [Fiona] What?
- Oh, damn.

1425
01:10:30,748 --> 01:10:32,016
That came out of your body.

1426
01:10:32,049 --> 01:10:34,284
Oh, my God.
[laughs]

1427
01:10:34,317 --> 01:10:36,520
I think I'm getting
a stomach bug.

1428
01:10:36,553 --> 01:10:38,122
Leave me alone.
[laughs]

1429
01:10:38,156 --> 01:10:39,456
To be honest, you should
be the one leaving me alone,

1430
01:10:39,489 --> 01:10:41,559
like Fi farts for my fall.

1431
01:10:41,592 --> 01:10:46,597
Ah, jerk some Janerism
generating Jamesom jiner.

1432
01:10:46,631 --> 01:10:48,465
Jameson jiner
with the Fi farts.

1433
01:10:48,498 --> 01:10:49,734
[Jane talking gibberish]

1434
01:10:49,767 --> 01:10:52,069
[Gemma]
Your passport's arrived.

1435
01:10:52,103 --> 01:10:54,105
Yes, good timing.

1436
01:10:54,138 --> 01:10:55,273
Where are you going?

1437
01:10:55,305 --> 01:10:56,641
Mexico.

1438
01:10:56,674 --> 01:10:58,109
Who, both of you?

1439
01:10:58,142 --> 01:10:59,911
Yeah, and Bailey.

1440
01:10:59,944 --> 01:11:01,646
Uh, no, I figured that
he was old enough

1441
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:03,147
to stay at home
and fend for himself.

1442
01:11:03,181 --> 01:11:04,782
Five is way too young.

1443
01:11:04,816 --> 01:11:06,284
Gotta wait 'til he's six,
he'll be self-sufficient,

1444
01:11:06,316 --> 01:11:08,653
then he can be our chauffer
and our chef.

1445
01:11:08,686 --> 01:11:10,387
Oh, I like that.

1446
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:12,089
Looking forward to next year.

1447
01:11:12,123 --> 01:11:15,126
- [Fiona and Gemma laughing]
- So when are you going again?

1448
01:11:15,159 --> 01:11:17,161
- Monday.
- Oh, shit.

1449
01:11:17,195 --> 01:11:19,263
So we should
reschedule the pitch.

1450
01:11:19,297 --> 01:11:21,999
No, no, absolutely not.
You got this.

1451
01:11:22,033 --> 01:11:23,634
Gem could only
get this week off,

1452
01:11:23,668 --> 01:11:26,469
so you know, who knows
when we can get away again.

1453
01:11:26,503 --> 01:11:28,639
No, totally, but like,
we should, like, reschedule it,

1454
01:11:28,673 --> 01:11:30,241
because I'm not
gonna do it right.

1455
01:11:30,274 --> 01:11:31,441
You've worked
really hard on this.

1456
01:11:31,474 --> 01:11:32,877
I wouldn't leave you with it

1457
01:11:32,910 --> 01:11:34,312
if I didn't think
you could handle it.

1458
01:11:34,344 --> 01:11:35,512
I can't handle it.

1459
01:11:35,545 --> 01:11:36,614
Okay, I'm gonna
go take a shower.

1460
01:11:36,647 --> 01:11:37,615
Okay.

1461
01:11:37,648 --> 01:11:38,983
[kissing]

1462
01:11:39,016 --> 01:11:40,751
- You're salty.
- Mm-hmm.

1463
01:11:40,785 --> 01:11:43,054
[Fiona and Gemma
laughing and kissing]

1464
01:11:47,892 --> 01:11:49,961
You know I suck
at the talking stuff, Fi.

1465
01:11:49,994 --> 01:11:51,329
Jane, you were
great last time.

1466
01:11:51,361 --> 01:11:53,297
No, I wasn't.
I, like, fumbled my words.

1467
01:11:53,331 --> 01:11:55,398
No, no, you were fine.
You got this, you got this.

1468
01:11:55,432 --> 01:11:56,533
[Bailey] <i>Mommy!</i>

1469
01:11:56,567 --> 01:11:57,869
[Fiona] Shit, okay.

1470
01:11:57,902 --> 01:11:59,804
I don't have time
to worry about this.

1471
01:11:59,837 --> 01:12:01,371
You will surprise yourself.
You always do.

1472
01:12:01,404 --> 01:12:02,573
[scoffs]

1473
01:12:06,177 --> 01:12:08,946
[Jane sighs]

1474
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:11,282
[Gemma on baby screen] <i>Why didn't you
tell her that we were gonna be gone?</i>

1475
01:12:11,315 --> 01:12:13,550
[Fiona] <i>Because
she gets in her head.</i>

1476
01:12:13,584 --> 01:12:15,620
[Gemma sighs]
<i>Well, maybe we should</i>

1477
01:12:15,653 --> 01:12:17,520
<i>just reschedule this
for later in the year.</i>

1478
01:12:17,555 --> 01:12:21,025
[Fiona] <i>No, no, she needs
to learn to be okay on her own.</i>

1479
01:12:21,058 --> 01:12:24,095
[gentle music]
[monitor beeps]

1480
01:12:35,538 --> 01:12:38,009
Do you believe
in heaven or hell?

1481
01:12:38,042 --> 01:12:39,644
Why, what do you believe in?

1482
01:12:41,178 --> 01:12:42,479
That's why I'm asking you,

1483
01:12:42,512 --> 01:12:46,384
because I don't know
where mommy went.

1484
01:12:49,186 --> 01:12:52,390
Well, um...

1485
01:12:55,126 --> 01:12:56,394
Come here.

1486
01:12:58,696 --> 01:13:00,264
[sighs]

1487
01:13:00,298 --> 01:13:05,803
I believe that we have
many, many, many, many lives,

1488
01:13:07,138 --> 01:13:12,009
and we're given
a test in each life,

1489
01:13:12,043 --> 01:13:14,145
and hopefully, we pass it.

1490
01:13:14,912 --> 01:13:16,580
Some of us do.

1491
01:13:18,082 --> 01:13:19,449
Some of us don't.

1492
01:13:21,551 --> 01:13:23,621
Some of us make mistakes,
you know?

1493
01:13:25,256 --> 01:13:28,426
Some of us keep
making those mistakes,

1494
01:13:28,458 --> 01:13:33,130
so we have to come back
and take the test again.

1495
01:13:34,131 --> 01:13:36,300
You think mommy
didn't pass the test?

1496
01:13:36,334 --> 01:13:38,468
Oh no, no, no, buddy.
I'm sorry.

1497
01:13:38,501 --> 01:13:40,571
That's not... that's not
what I meant.

1498
01:13:40,604 --> 01:13:42,773
I'm saying it wrong.

1499
01:13:42,807 --> 01:13:46,210
So, mommy's learning
new lessons?

1500
01:13:47,645 --> 01:13:48,946
Maybe.

1501
01:13:48,980 --> 01:13:51,582
Like a baby, or a squirrel,
or a child,

1502
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:53,451
or a turtle, I don't know.

1503
01:13:53,483 --> 01:13:55,518
A baby, maybe, but...

1504
01:13:57,154 --> 01:14:00,558
So, like, there's a baby
out there that's her?

1505
01:14:04,261 --> 01:14:08,065
No one really knows, Bails,

1506
01:14:08,099 --> 01:14:09,700
and we never will.

1507
01:14:11,302 --> 01:14:14,105
It's the most...

1508
01:14:14,138 --> 01:14:16,307
beautiful and tragic
part of life.

1509
01:14:17,808 --> 01:14:19,844
I feel like we
should know though.

1510
01:14:23,647 --> 01:14:26,017
Do you think you're
going to pass the test?

1511
01:14:26,817 --> 01:14:29,519
I have no idea, B-boy.

1512
01:14:31,288 --> 01:14:32,857
No idea.

1513
01:14:36,494 --> 01:14:38,596
[Bailey] You okay?

1514
01:14:38,629 --> 01:14:39,964
Yeah.

1515
01:14:39,997 --> 01:14:40,998
[door opens]

1516
01:14:41,032 --> 01:14:42,166
[Gemma] Hello?

1517
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:44,368
I'm out here.

1518
01:14:49,573 --> 01:14:52,710
[slowly approaching footsteps]

1519
01:15:05,990 --> 01:15:08,692
Gem, we can't do this anymore.

1520
01:15:11,662 --> 01:15:13,431
We're always gonna choose her.

1521
01:15:14,598 --> 01:15:15,733
I know.

1522
01:15:16,734 --> 01:15:18,769
I don't know.

1523
01:15:21,338 --> 01:15:24,108
I'm not sure how
to do this without you.

1524
01:15:25,242 --> 01:15:26,410
Me too.

1525
01:15:27,945 --> 01:15:30,047
I mean, I don't know why I...

1526
01:15:30,848 --> 01:15:33,818
[gentle piano music]

1527
01:15:33,851 --> 01:15:36,320
I don't know why
I can't say the words.

1528
01:15:36,353 --> 01:15:41,325
Please, don't say them
because...

1529
01:15:41,358 --> 01:15:43,427
if you say them,
I won't want to go.

1530
01:15:46,197 --> 01:15:47,631
And I need to go.

1531
01:15:53,971 --> 01:15:55,873
I do though.

1532
01:15:55,906 --> 01:15:58,109
We need to think about Bailey.

1533
01:16:11,255 --> 01:16:12,857
I love you.

1534
01:16:13,624 --> 01:16:15,092
I love you too.

1535
01:16:16,393 --> 01:16:19,430
[emotional piano music]

1536
01:16:35,246 --> 01:16:37,882
[Bobby]
Ma'am, one second, hold.

1537
01:16:37,915 --> 01:16:39,717
I need permission.

1538
01:16:40,784 --> 01:16:42,386
Hello?

1539
01:16:42,419 --> 01:16:43,654
Landlord.

1540
01:16:44,655 --> 01:16:46,056
Hey, Bobby.
What are you doing?

1541
01:16:46,090 --> 01:16:47,324
Uh, there's a woman
here to see you.

1542
01:16:47,358 --> 01:16:48,792
She says it's an emergency.

1543
01:16:48,826 --> 01:16:51,362
- Is it Gemma?
- You also haven't paid rent.

1544
01:16:52,496 --> 01:16:54,665
I told you to wait outside.

1545
01:16:54,698 --> 01:16:56,734
Are you smoking
in the apartment?

1546
01:16:57,968 --> 01:16:59,136
Not that I know of.

1547
01:17:01,805 --> 01:17:03,073
Hi, Ruth.
What are you doing here?

1548
01:17:03,107 --> 01:17:05,242
You need to get
your act together.

1549
01:17:05,276 --> 01:17:06,844
[Jane] I don't need
to do anything.

1550
01:17:06,877 --> 01:17:07,978
Okay.

1551
01:17:09,446 --> 01:17:12,216
Come on, up.
Up, you get.

1552
01:17:13,450 --> 01:17:15,753
Take a shower.
You stink.

1553
01:17:15,786 --> 01:17:17,656
And then we're gonna
get your puppy.

1554
01:17:17,688 --> 01:17:19,190
What?

1555
01:17:19,223 --> 01:17:21,660
I got one; his name is Cookie.
He's very lovable.

1556
01:17:21,692 --> 01:17:23,260
Well, I don't need a Cookie.

1557
01:17:25,696 --> 01:17:27,531
Gemma's having
