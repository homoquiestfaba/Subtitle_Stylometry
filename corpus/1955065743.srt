1
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:22,149
I'm sorry.

2
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:23,751
I hope I didn't
disturb you.

3
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:25,957
No, that's alright.
lt's just...

4
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:29,690
been a really long day.

5
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,702
What brings you to Brazil?

6
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,170
How long do you have?

7
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,076
About 14 hours.

8
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:43,713
Well, I guess...

9
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,979
I'm going to try
to save my life.

10
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:02,060
Twenty years ago,
I started this company

11
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,261
with two night watchmen
and a guard dog,

12
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,861
and now we have the chance
to turn it into one

13
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:08,406
of the largest
privately-held

14
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,806
corporate security firms
in the country.

15
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,400
The bank wants
its money, Paul.

16
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:16,877
Jericho is bleeding
Tycor dry and you.

17
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:20,475
We shouldn't have invested all the
company's assets into one basket.

18
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:25,455
Project Jericho, utilizing
market-leading processing power,

19
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:28,891
this impenetrable, unified
threat management system

20
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:31,259
decrypts and inspects
data and traffic

21
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,160
throughout all
network layers.

22
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,099
Ten years ago I never would've
dreamed of anything this ambitious.

23
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,193
That's because you weren't
a careless dreamer.

24
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:41,205
You know what, James? I know you've
been with me since the beginning.

25
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:42,433
That's enough.

26
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,942
I know you don't like it;
I think it's worth the risk.

27
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,602
Yeah, SYS-Tek
will probably buy it,

28
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,203
so they won't have to
compete with us.

29
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:49,542
He'll make a fortune.

30
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:51,947
He's already borrowed
and spent a fortune, Ryan!

31
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:56,147
It's time to consider Brazil's
offer of a cash injection,

32
00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:01,124
or share Tycor's proprietary
systems with SYS-Tek,

33
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,489
and offer a merger.

34
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:05,358
SYS-Tek plays dirty.
They can't be trusted.

35
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:09,390
And Ryan, if I take the BVCA's
money, they're gonna own me.

36
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,431
And if you don't,
you will own nothing.

37
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,506
They're our last hope.

38
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:18,805
If Jericho works, I can
sell it on the open market.

39
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,072
We won't even
need Brazil's money.

40
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:24,415
So does it work?

41
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,411
Let's go find out.

42
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,050
Okay, geniuses,
tell me something good.

43
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:38,596
Well, 500 Gray Hats
are about to tell us.

44
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:39,562
Gray Hats?

45
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,599
We've invited the world's
best computer hackers

46
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:42,565
to try and breach Jericho.

47
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:45,000
They're called "Gray Hats" because
they're neither good nor evil.

48
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,332
Just somewhere in between.

49
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,464
If they can't get in,
no one can.

50
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,302
Alright, everybody, heads up.

51
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:54,569
Jericho goes live in 5...

52
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:56,113
4...

53
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,640
3...

54
00:03:58,138 --> 00:03:59,310
2...

55
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:00,777
1-

56
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:05,914
What? Are they already in?

57
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,755
Jericho's just telling us
someone's knocking at the door.

58
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,055
Status?

59
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,294
China is locked down,
and Russia's filtered.

60
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:17,265
UK denied, Germany as well.

61
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:23,300
I've got Mexico boxed in,
and Egypt is blocked.

62
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:25,370
It's working.

63
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,980
Each one of those chimes is
$1 million in your bank account.

64
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,311
Yeah, well, the first million
goes back to the bank.

65
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,044
Indeed, one way or another.

66
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:36,380
We are going worldwide.

67
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:39,983
I've got a straggler
in sector four.

68
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:42,617
A little late to the party,
aren't you, buddy?

69
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:44,593
I hate late crashers.

70
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,399
Origin?

71
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,026
I can't quite pinpoint it.

72
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:54,038
It looks like he's using some
kind of malware, maybe a botnet?

73
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:56,472
China just went down.
Russia is out.

74
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,440
Where are you at?

75
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,568
Yeah, UK is down,
and so is Germany.

76
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:03,877
Mexico just disappeared,
and I can't see Egypt.

77
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:08,181
Security breach in sectors
four, three, seven.

78
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,311
Full breech.

79
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:10,377
System collapse.

80
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,184
We're entering safe mode.

81
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,282
Okay, what's happening?

82
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,384
Fail-safe protocol.

83
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:22,159
The system self-preserved by shutting
itself down and going offline.

84
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:25,893
Who is JOS620?

85
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,370
He's gloating, sir.

86
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,873
- Find out how he did it.
- Well, he's not gonna tell us.

87
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,102
It's a game
to these people.

88
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,371
Well, great,
maybe we should've hired him.

89
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:38,348
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,619
I know you've all
been working hard.

91
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:42,983
Just find him!

92
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:46,748
Call Brazil.

93
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:07,475
- Ah, hey hon.
- Hi, sweetie.

94
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,684
How many people
are you inviting?

95
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:16,710
We are inviting 20 of our
closest friends and relatives.

96
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:18,278
Alright, let me
just remind you

97
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:20,882
this is a wedding vow
renewal ceremony,

98
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,291
not a royal wedding
at the palace.

99
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,626
Have you worked
on your wedding vows?

100
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:32,930
No, not yet, but I will.

101
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:34,438
I promise.

102
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,467
I saw Liz today.

103
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,003
Yeah?

104
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,342
She said her and David
are separated.

105
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,881
What? Why?

106
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,109
She didn't go into it,

107
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,413
but I think it had
something to do with cheating.

108
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:54,120
David had an affair?

109
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:56,991
Oh, it seemed like they
had such a strong marriage.

110
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,687
I know.

111
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,698
You just never know.

112
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,597
Yeah.

113
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,438
Hey, Brenda.

114
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:13,239
- What you got for me?
- I'm not sure how to put it.

115
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,337
James contacted
the BVCA last night.

116
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:17,404
- Brazil?
- They're sending someone over

117
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,246
to evaluate the financial health
and well-being of Tycor.

118
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:22,082
Yeah, great, when?

119
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:23,553
N ow.

120
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:34,029
Tycor, we're here
to keep your secrets.

121
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:47,245
Your father was
a very handsome man.

122
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:50,407
Excuse me?

123
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,881
And you have his eyes.

124
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:55,314
Sorry, I'm Julia Santos.

125
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:58,413
I am with the Brazilian
Venture Capitalist Association,

126
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,424
and you must be Paul?

127
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:04,090
Yeah, you're the Brazilian?

128
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,161
Yes, I'm the Brazilian.

129
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:12,335
Why didn't the BVCA
tell us you were coming?

130
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:14,167
Uh, well...

131
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:23,603
I think they wanted to keep
my surprise visit a surprise.

132
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:27,745
Actually, the truth is

133
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:31,584
I was in the United States
doing other business,

134
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:37,356
and this seemed,
how do you say, prudent?

135
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:41,888
Interesting, I would think
it would be more, how do we say,

136
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:44,299
oh, remarkably convenient?

137
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:51,433
I'm staying at the Plaza,
and you can have the last year

138
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:54,536
and year-to-dates
financial reports sent there,

139
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,979
and we can prepare
over the weekend.

140
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:59,112
Financial reports?

141
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:00,549
Yes.

142
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:08,616
We can reconvene on Monday.

143
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,161
And my cell phone number
is on the back of the card,

144
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:15,063
if you have any questions
or concerns.

145
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,299
Nice to meet you, Paul.

146
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:24,973
Did she catch you
with your pants down?

147
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:27,378
That's not funny.
It's not funny.

148
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:28,913
Oh, it's funny.

149
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,140
She is beautiful.

150
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:33,684
Really?
I hadn't noticed.

151
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:35,986
Yeah.

152
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,616
But why are you so uptight?

153
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:42,524
Look, if she decides that
our company is not a safe bet...

154
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,153
That is our last chance
at survival.

155
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:47,255
Relax, I've seen this happen
all the time.

156
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,596
As soon as you hook the client,
you woo her, you court her,

157
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:52,865
you tell her everything she wants
to hear until she feels safe.

158
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,634
Just, you know,
only let her see your good side.

159
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:57,931
My good side?

160
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,601
Your good side.
Stay focused.

161
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,202
I gotcha, thanks.

162
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,537
Your office is the other way.

163
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,947
Thanks.

164
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,023
Come on, slowpoke.
You're gonna miss the warm-ups.

165
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,717
Okay, that's tight enough.

166
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:17,590
Come on, Dad.
I gotta get out there.

167
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:18,628
People are looking.

168
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:21,222
Hey, safety first. You gotta
protect yourself at all times.

169
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,664
Alright, Coop,
be a good teammate!

170
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,099
Pass to your sister!

171
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,735
Oh, hey hon, thank you.

172
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:34,209
So, how are those marriage
renewal vows coming along?

173
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:37,180
Oh honey,
I've been so busy at work.

174
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:40,116
I'm so sorry.
I'm gonna get to it.

175
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:41,618
Let's go, Coop!

176
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,119
Let's go, Rube!

177
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,621
Quit kidding yourself.

178
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,523
We must understand
the tremendous capacity

179
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:52,358
of every human being
to deceive him or herself

180
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,364
when not connected to God.

181
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,923
You and I really don't
have the anchor in our lives

182
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,470
that we need
to overcome the temptations

183
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,938
that are shot our way
on a daily basis.

184
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:05,909
Know that once we start
making excuses for sin,

185
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:08,571
each excuse
seems more plausible,

186
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:12,082
and you'll sink deeper
and deeper into sin and ruin.

187
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:17,110
We must admit that we can't
trust ourselves apart from God.

188
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:21,717
Sure, sometimes God tests us,
but the choice is ours.

189
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:25,285
Will we choose to obey Him?

190
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:36,604
Oh, look honey,
there's Liz and David.

191
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,138
Let's go talk to them.
Come on.

192
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:42,144
I'll be there
in just a minute, okay?

193
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,374
Okay.

194
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,455
Hey, Paul.

195
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:58,360
Listen, I haven't seen you
in study the last few weeks,

196
00:11:58,418 --> 00:11:59,453
and we have two left.

197
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,692
Just hoping
you can join us this week.

198
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:03,967
Thank you.

199
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:07,766
I'd love to go,
I'm just so busy.

200
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:09,636
- I understand. Ok.
- I wanna go. I wanna go.

201
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:12,506
- Alright, it's good to see ya.
- Thank you. You too.

202
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:21,718
Liz! Liz!

203
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,913
I don't know
what you're going through,

204
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:25,957
but I'm here for you.

205
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:28,515
Do you wanna
tell me anything?

206
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,922
Just be there for me.

207
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,359
Okay.

208
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,733
I made lunch reservations
for Friday

209
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,999
at that new restaurant
on Tucker Street.

210
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:45,099
You know, the one we're thinking
about catering our ceremony?

211
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,974
I thought we should try it
before we commit.

212
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,416
I'm so worried about Liz.

213
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:56,420
I wish she would just open up
to me and tell me what happened.

214
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:02,722
Earth to Paul.

215
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,588
Paul.

216
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:06,687
Hmm?

217
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:09,666
Liz and David, I mean,

218
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,499
having an affair
is a humiliating thing

219
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,299
to open up about.

220
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,767
Has David said
anything to you?

221
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:23,378
There's a Brazilian
corporation

222
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:26,383
that's been threatening
to invest in our company

223
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:29,045
for the past
several months now.

224
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:31,554
Threatening?

225
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:37,027
They can't make up their minds,
so they sent a liaison, a spy,

226
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:39,931
really just to snoop around

227
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,466
to see if we have any
skeletons in our closet.

228
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:45,969
Well, will the man
find anything?

229
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:48,567
What man?

230
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:51,541
The liaison,
the man from Brazil.

231
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:55,741
You mean, he's not gonna
find anything, right?

232
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:00,513
No, of course not.

233
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:32,449
Morning, Brenda.

234
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:34,280
James left your report
on your desk.

235
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,444
Oh, and the bank called,

236
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:37,886
something about your
car payment not being sent.

237
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:40,322
Hey, do you think
my tie matches my shin?

238
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,859
Yeah, sure, looks great.

239
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,827
So what should I tell the bank?

240
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,229
Tell them my tie
matches my shin.

241
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,840
- This is Paul.
- Oh, hi honey.

242
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,608
I'm sorry.
What's all the racket?

243
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:07,116
Oh, just Cooper exercising
his right to be an 8-year-old,

244
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:09,585
and Ruby is...
Ruby, what are you doing?

245
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:10,813
Ruby, please stop.

246
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:13,357
Be careful with that.
Guys...

247
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:17,127
Hi, you must be Julia.

248
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:19,527
- Yes, is Paul around?
- Yes.

249
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,293
- He's waiting for you in his office.
- Oh, perfect. Thank you.

250
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:23,732
So how's that?

251
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,327
Anyway, I was just calling
to see if you could pick up

252
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,929
Cooper's shinguards
before the game tomorrow morning.

253
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:30,531
We had to re-order.

254
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:34,276
Uh... yeah, right, okay.

255
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,040
I'll have to get back to you.

256
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:42,315
Miss Santos, good morn...
Oh!

257
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,219
- Good morning.
- Oh, please call me Julia.

258
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,416
There's no need
for formalities.

259
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:51,786
- Your CFO, James, is it?
- Yeah.

260
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:54,195
Yes, he told me
that you wanted to go over

261
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:56,529
the financial reports
with me personally?

262
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:58,933
Yes, Julia.

263
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:01,861
I don't know, I guess I just
feel that I'm responsible

264
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:04,272
for the good
and the bad.

265
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:08,301
Oh, that's admirable,
and the BVCA believes

266
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:11,371
that when it comes to
making financial investments,

267
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:14,418
a man's character is
as important as his bottom line.

268
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:19,986
So, how was your weekend?

269
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,025
Restful.

270
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:25,658
I'm lying.
I was actually bored to death.

271
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:30,757
I don't know anybody
in Los Angeles,

272
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:36,569
and I didn't have the first idea
of what to do or where to go.

273
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:38,006
Oh, come on.

274
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:39,839
It's the City of Angels.

275
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,379
We have millions
of tourists every year.

276
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:44,642
I mean, you could go to Disneyland,
you could go to the

277
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:46,505
Hollywood Walk of Fame,
you could go to the beach,

278
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:49,885
you could go to O.J. Simpson's house,
Marilyn Monroe's house, I mean...

279
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:52,821
Are you offering to be
my personal tour guide?

280
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,327
You know what I'm gonna do?

281
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:02,889
I'm gonna have Brenda
write up an itinerary for you.

282
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:11,336
Your wife?

283
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,070
No, Brenda's not my...

284
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:19,810
Oh, yeah,
that's my wife, Beth,

285
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:22,517
and my two kids.

286
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,184
The financial reports.

287
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:29,724
Oh, I'm sorry.

288
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:31,625
The financial reports
aren't ready.

289
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:34,494
Maybe if we just had
a little more advanced notice.

290
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:35,658
I understand.

291
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,632
When do you think
you will have them by?

292
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:38,930
Well, we're working
on them right now.

293
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,493
We should have them
by the end of the day.

294
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,005
Tomorrow morning then?

295
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,905
Tomorrow morning
my son has a soccer game,

296
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:49,105
and I never miss a game.

297
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:51,582
Well, then tonight it is.

298
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:57,150
I will come back
at the end of the day,

299
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,519
and we can work
on them together.

300
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:04,393
Do you have a problem
working late tonight?

301
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,861
Of course, it'll be fun.

302
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,490
I mean, that's fine.

303
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:13,435
Yeah, that's fine.
I'll see you then.

304
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:16,029
They're lovely, by the way.

305
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:19,208
Your family.

306
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,175
See you tonight.

307
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,539
Look, I don't know what
you're so worried about.

308
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,482
I mean, owners
of large companies

309
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,349
work long hours
all the time,

310
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:32,719
especially when they got
visitors from foreign countries.

311
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,223
I know.

312
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,891
It's just something
about this woman.

313
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,265
She's driving me crazy.

314
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:45,268
I can see that,
and I don't blame you.

315
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,432
What is Beth gonna say?

316
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,337
About what? Who? Julia?

317
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:53,104
You don't tell her.

318
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:56,009
Ryan, I don't lie to my wife.

319
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,911
It's not lying
if you don't say anything.

320
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,007
Okay, I'm not that stupid.

321
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:03,109
You and Beth
are going camping, okay?

322
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:05,655
It's at night, and she's
asleep in a sleeping bag.

323
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:08,157
You zip up the tent, you spin
around, and what do you see?

324
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:10,751
You see a spider
crawling up the sleeping bag.

325
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:11,828
What do you do?

326
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,886
Do you yell all of a sudden,
"Hey, Beth, watch out!

327
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:16,263
"There's a spider! It's coming!
It's gonna get you!"

328
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,563
- No, and why not?
- Because she'd freak out.

329
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:22,800
Exactly, she would freak out
and in the process get bit.

330
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:24,940
SQ?

331
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:31,481
Look, there's a saying, "What they
don't know won't hurt'em."

332
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:35,246
But my saying is,
"What they do know will hurt them

333
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:37,049
and bite them."

334
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,953
So no spider, no bite, easy.

335
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:46,389
Dude, relax.
Relax.

336
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:50,628
I'm sure this woman sees you
for your true, inner potential.

337
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:53,197
I don't know.

338
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:55,500
Are you seeing somebody
about these issues?

339
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:58,167
- About what?
- Issues, you. You have issues.

340
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:01,211
- No, you have issues.
- And you should see a shrink.

341
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:03,770
You should, you know, somebody
to give you some meds,

342
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:06,339
get the edge off,
help you get through the day.

343
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:09,249
No, I don't believe in that.

344
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:10,853
You don't know what
you're talking about.

345
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,218
Look, I'm gonna do you a big favor.

346
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:14,724
I'm gonna give you my shrink
'cause he's good,

347
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,953
a little out there,
but he's good, okay?

348
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:19,018
You're gonna love him,
and you're gonna thank me.

349
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:22,424
You got this one.

350
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:24,024
See my shrink!

351
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,728
You need a new shrink!

352
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,327
I'm fine!

353
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:31,869
Thanks for helping out, Rose.

354
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:35,071
I've been so busy planning
the ceremony, I'm just...

355
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:36,738
l feel overwhelmed.

356
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:38,406
No problem, hon.

357
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,917
I thought
all this technology

358
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:45,478
was supposed to make
our lives easier.

359
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:51,391
I'm telling you, if you ask me,
the machines we have now

360
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,488
actually make our lives
harder to manage.

361
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:57,534
- Is this right?
- No, you doofus, it's B!

362
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,537
Hey, don't call
your brother a "doofus."

363
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:03,472
I mean, the computers,
the Internet...

364
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:04,872
and that thing.

365
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,501
Don't even get me
started on cell phones.

366
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:11,648
Oh.

367
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:13,877
I got it, C.

368
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,555
You're right.
lam a doofus.

369
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:24,990
Is everything alright?

370
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:28,798
Oh, I'm sure it is.

371
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:36,234
Why didn't you give
the financial report to Julia?

372
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:38,969
I guess...

373
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:43,945
I told myself
I didn't want her to know

374
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:46,711
we're in default
with the banks,

375
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,884
that I was up to
my eyeballs in debt.

376
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:52,320
I was just trying to
keep my head above water.

377
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:55,084
But maybe the real reason?

378
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:59,561
I just wanted to be around her
as long as I could.

379
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:01,556
Oh.

380
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:06,062
And that's why you lied to your wife
about who you were with?

381
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,072
Well, this is a good start.

382
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,274
Yeah, from the looks
of these reports,

383
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,813
everything seems
to be in order.

384
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:17,779
Great.

385
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:20,784
And you know the BVCA
recognizes the increased

386
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,877
and growing need
for corporate security,

387
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:25,821
which is why your company
is intriguing to us.

388
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:28,825
I'm in the business of
keeping people's secrets hidden.

389
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:32,955
I guess as the world gets bigger
and more complicated,

390
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,226
so do their secrets.

391
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:49,675
You know, my dad left
when I was a little girl,

392
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:53,409
and I don't remember
much about him.

393
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:56,486
That must have been hard...

394
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,653
Growing up without him.

395
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,350
A girl accepts
whatever the world

396
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:03,859
puts in front of her
without question.

397
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:07,293
But...

398
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:13,063
I don't trust men
as a result.

399
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:19,041
I'm afraid to get close
to them in fear that

400
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:22,074
they will leave.

401
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,578
You're single?

402
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,841
I mean, I'm just...

403
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,087
I just assumed a woman
like you would,

404
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:34,587
be in a relationship.

405
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,524
I suppose I haven't met
the right man yet.

406
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:42,394
I want to know what
you are thinking right now.

407
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:44,926
Excuse me?

408
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,526
Let me guess.

409
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:50,506
You think these reports could
fool a young girl from Brazil?

410
00:23:52,298 --> 00:23:55,575
I thought you just said
that the reports were in order.

411
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:57,272
- I'm kidding.
- Oh.

412
00:23:57,336 --> 00:23:58,474
I'm kidding.

413
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:00,949
- Well, that's not funny.
- I'm kidding.

414
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:06,449
But they tell me
what you've done,

415
00:24:06,512 --> 00:24:11,120
and I want to know
where you're going.

416
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:15,560
I want to know
what is not in the reports.

417
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:22,698
I want to know your secrets,
Paul Tyson.

418
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:25,371
I want to...

419
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:30,137
know what you are hiding.

420
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:01,929
Beth, honey, can you get that,
pretty please?

421
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:05,204
Beth?

422
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,441
Hello?

423
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:18,454
Hey, you still at home?
I called you over an hour ago.

424
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,888
- You're missing the game.
- Oh!

425
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:23,256
I must have
fallen back asleep.

426
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:26,592
Sorry, I was at the office
all night with Julia.

427
00:26:26,652 --> 00:26:28,563
Honey, I can't hear.
Hold on.

428
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,864
What? Who's Julia?

429
00:26:33,726 --> 00:26:36,070
She's the liaison from Brazil.

430
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:38,404
I thought I told you about her.

431
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,374
Oh yeah, you did.

432
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,877
You just never mentioned
she was a woman.

433
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:45,776
Didn't I?

434
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:50,748
No. Alright,
I'll see you soon, okay?

435
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:53,519
Okay.

436
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,050
Paul!

437
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:08,360
Huh?

438
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:13,861
Are you okay?

439
00:28:13,926 --> 00:28:16,270
Yeah, I'm fine, fine.

440
00:28:16,328 --> 00:28:18,604
What's that all about?

441
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:20,203
What?

442
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:22,176
Nothing.

443
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:26,072
You know, l thought
you might not have

444
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:28,118
been up for date night
tonight.

445
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,814
Are you kidding?

446
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,855
Come on.

447
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:40,654
Oh, sorry.

448
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:54,738
Well, maybe we can
make it an earlier night.

449
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,606
Sorry.

450
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:01,006
Are you sure
every-thing's okay?

451
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,816
Yeah, every-thing's fine,
Beth, really.

452
00:29:05,277 --> 00:29:10,283
You know, Matt said that you
missed men's Bible study again.

453
00:29:11,717 --> 00:29:13,719
A lot going on
at work is all.

454
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,493
I'm just gonna
go ahead and say it.

455
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:22,831
It just, it seems like you've
been so busy at work lately

456
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:27,572
that you don't even answer
my phone calls anymore.

457
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:30,512
I'm sorry I missed
the soccer game.

458
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:32,105
It's just a game.

459
00:29:32,805 --> 00:29:35,479
I've got a lot
going on at work.

460
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:37,179
You wouldn't understand.

461
00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:47,157
So what do you hear
from Liz and David?

462
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:52,362
Nothing.

463
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:56,996
Liz has just basically
disappeared.

464
00:29:58,197 --> 00:30:00,302
I'm so disappointed in David.

465
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:04,040
None of us can begin to
trust ourselves apart from God.

466
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:07,814
Isn't that what Pastor said?

467
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:12,719
Infidelity is
an outside threat, Beth.

468
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:15,054
It's like a common burglar.

469
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:18,325
A man should be able
to protect his family.

470
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:31,169
Jericho status report.

471
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:32,572
What's the rush?

472
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:33,905
Julia wants it.

473
00:30:33,966 --> 00:30:35,968
I'm supposed to
meet her at noon.

474
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:38,415
I thought this was
for your eyes only.

475
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:41,314
There are things in here we may not
be ready to share with the outside.

476
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:44,582
I'll get there early,
and I'll proof it.

477
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:45,849
Don't worry.

478
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:09,311
Thank you.

479
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:11,848
I'm meeting someone here
in about an hour or so.

480
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:13,405
I'll order then?

481
00:31:13,472 --> 00:31:15,474
Thank you. Appreciate it.

482
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,573
You're early.

483
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:42,772
I respect a man
that's punctual.

484
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:45,007
Shows his attention
to detail.

485
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,915
I brought the R&D reports,

486
00:31:48,974 --> 00:31:52,820
the projection analysis based
on the Project Jericho roll out.

487
00:31:52,878 --> 00:31:55,791
I'm sure Tycor
has a very bright future.

488
00:31:57,983 --> 00:32:01,260
Well, I have
worked very hard

489
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,163
to keep that company
in the forefront.

490
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:04,996
To think that you've
managed all of this

491
00:32:05,057 --> 00:32:07,731
while raising a family
and being a devoted husband,

492
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:10,831
well, I've yet
to meet a man like you.

493
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:17,374
Thank you.

494
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:21,047
It's true, too many successful
men ignore their families,

495
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:23,347
and somehow
you found the balance.

496
00:32:24,209 --> 00:32:26,951
Well, my wife...

497
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:29,890
Doesn't appreciate
everything that you do

498
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,188
to keep the machine running?

499
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:34,594
I mean, a guy can't go to
every soccer game, right?

500
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:36,758
I know exactly
what you mean.

501
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,765
Ooh, wow!

502
00:32:42,661 --> 00:32:44,038
Can I be honest with you?

503
00:32:44,096 --> 00:32:45,404
Yes.

504
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:48,570
I'm not sure
if this report is accurate.

505
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:51,341
I haven't had
a chance to proofread it.

506
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:54,941
It's okay, Paul.
It's okay.

507
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:57,509
I know that you
are a very busy man.

508
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,359
Off the record here?

509
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:11,495
Of course.

510
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:14,799
Every friendship is
founded on trust, no?

511
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:21,234
I'm not sure that
Project Jericho is really ready.

512
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:29,279
Paul, may I admit something
to you, as you say,

513
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,878
off the record?

514
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,753
L...

515
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:41,495
Oh, no!

516
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:45,161
It's alright, sorry,
I just... I'm sorry.

517
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:47,328
I wasn't paying attention
to what I was doing.

518
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:49,394
I just...

519
00:33:53,832 --> 00:33:57,109
I'm sorry,
I spilled everything, and I...

520
00:33:57,569 --> 00:33:59,173
Sit, please.

521
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:01,547
This is so embarrassing.
I'm sorry.

522
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:05,276
I brought the R&D reports,
the projection analysis based on...

523
00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:07,052
Oh, whoo!

524
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:11,826
Ay, well, something tells me

525
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:15,353
that we are not going to be
getting much work done today,

526
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:20,665
so I do have to wrap this up,

527
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:24,696
and I'm afraid that I have to
be in Brazil by next week, so...

528
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:26,507
Brazil?

529
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,702
Why so soon?

530
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:33,705
Because it's home.

531
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:38,816
Of course, it's home.

532
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:40,815
Mm-hmm.

533
00:34:42,314 --> 00:34:43,554
Of course, yeah.

534
00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:48,121
I'm gonna print out
another one of these for you.

535
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:49,756
Please.

536
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:51,266
Let me know.

537
00:34:51,323 --> 00:34:52,825
I will.

538
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:12,077
Yes.

539
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:18,357
I'd like to make
an appointment.

540
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:28,399
Mr. Tyson.

541
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:33,040
Dr. Howell, thanks for
seeing me at the last minute.

542
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:35,544
Well, we had a last-minute
cancellation.

543
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,806
You're lucky.

544
00:35:38,003 --> 00:35:40,142
My last client of the night.

545
00:35:40,205 --> 00:35:41,650
Thank you.

546
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:45,950
So you say here that you're
having feelings of anxiety.

547
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:48,687
What medications are you
currently taking?

548
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:52,124
None, I don't take any.

549
00:35:54,286 --> 00:35:56,288
Well, then you've
come to the right place.

550
00:35:57,622 --> 00:36:01,297
No, no,
I'm not here for that.

551
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:04,973
I need help.

552
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:09,376
For the last week or so
I've had difficulty...

553
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,113
How do I say this?

554
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:16,177
Concentrating.

555
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:20,182
I have this issue
with my company,

556
00:36:20,946 --> 00:36:24,120
but I've been so distracted
by this...

557
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:30,890
this other thing, yeah,
that I just haven't been able to

558
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:35,097
take care
of the work at hand.

559
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:40,037
Other thing?

560
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:50,116
I'm attracted to a woman

561
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:52,754
that I work with,

562
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,627
and I'm married.

563
00:37:01,086 --> 00:37:02,565
Now I see.

564
00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:06,493
So, how long have you
been having an affair?

565
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:08,469
Oh, no, it's not like that.

566
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:11,564
I don't even think she knows
that I think about her.

567
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:14,542
So, what you're saying is
that you haven't physically

568
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:17,478
consummated your attraction
to her in any way?

569
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,413
No, it's not like that.

570
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:23,214
Well, perhaps you've
shared videos, photographs,

571
00:37:23,308 --> 00:37:27,484
and texts with provocative
overtones?

572
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,583
No, like I said,

573
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:34,686
I think that she assumes

574
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:37,859
this is strictly
a business relationship.

575
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:42,471
Well, that's what it sounds
like to me, Mr. Tyson.

576
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:47,471
The feelings of
attraction to women is normal,

577
00:37:47,532 --> 00:37:49,512
if not downright healthy.

578
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:53,071
I can't stop
thinking about her.

579
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,947
It's interfering
with my job

580
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:03,651
and my marriage.

581
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:13,259
I'm supposed to be renewing
my wedding vows in a few days.

582
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:19,707
Once again, you cannot control
your more base desires.

583
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:23,007
I mean, if every married man
that dreamt of sleeping

584
00:38:23,068 --> 00:38:25,344
with another woman
sought my counsel,

585
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:30,242
I'd be a very rich
doctor indeed.

586
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:32,616
- The Bible says...
- Oh.

587
00:38:32,911 --> 00:38:36,484
The Bible, oh, I see,
religious guilt,

588
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:39,562
not as profitable as fantasy,

589
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:42,629
but it's kept me
in good shape.

590
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:46,430
Paul, listen to me carefully.

591
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:49,700
You need to understand
the feelings that you're having

592
00:38:49,761 --> 00:38:52,935
are no way a threat to your
relationship with your wife.

593
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,136
As a matter of fact,

594
00:38:56,301 --> 00:38:59,510
if your wife had the right
attitude about the whole thing,

595
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,947
she could find it
actually enhance it.

596
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,653
I don't see myself

597
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:10,659
being able to convince her
of that anytime soon.

598
00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:12,558
I bet the emotional
excitement you get

599
00:39:12,617 --> 00:39:14,756
from flirting with this woman

600
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:19,199
just brings more vitality
and passion to your marriage.

601
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:22,768
You just mentioned you want
to renew your wedding vows.

602
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:27,875
Well, that kind of energy
is a renewal in and of itself.

603
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:36,117
So I'm not doing
anything wrong?

604
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:43,184
Wrong is not a word we like
to use in my profession.

605
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,421
No.

606
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:50,957
You think for the time being
there is no wrong.

607
00:39:57,295 --> 00:40:00,333
There is no wrong.

608
00:40:11,543 --> 00:40:12,749
There is no wrong.

609
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,486
There is no wrong.

610
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,931
- Oh, good morning, Brenda.
- Good morning.

611
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,765
James is waiting for you
in your office.

612
00:40:27,826 --> 00:40:29,328
Excellent!
Just the man I wanna see!

613
00:40:29,394 --> 00:40:31,465
Ok, here's what I need.
I need a half an hour.

614
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:32,906
No interruptions,
no matter what.

615
00:40:32,964 --> 00:40:34,910
And I also need another copy
of the Jericho report.

616
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:38,004
Okay, so the bank called again
about your car payment.

617
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:41,107
- What do you want me to do?
- I'll fix it, no worries.

618
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:50,089
- Paul, we need to talk.
- Yes, we do.

619
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:51,957
I heard from the bank
this morning.

620
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:53,154
Of course you did.

621
00:40:53,218 --> 00:40:54,754
Were you able
to buy us some time?

622
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:56,560
- Yes, 5 days.
- That's good.

623
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:59,727
But that was 4 days ago.
Time's up, Paul.

624
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,293
If you've got
something up your sleeve,

625
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,270
now is the time
to pull it out.

626
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:06,065
We're gonna roll out
Project Jericho.

627
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,132
It isn't ready.
I just talked to Matt...

628
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,837
It's ready enough!

629
00:41:09,901 --> 00:41:10,971
I'm gonna make
the announcement

630
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:13,037
at the next projections
meeting for the BVCA.

631
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:14,378
What projections meeting?

632
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:16,180
The one we're having
Monday morning.

633
00:41:16,274 --> 00:41:19,687
Paul, if the BVCA
invests in Tycor

634
00:41:19,744 --> 00:41:22,588
because you've intentionally
misrepresented yourself,

635
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:26,026
both they and the bank
can bring legal action.

636
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:31,062
You think you have problems now?
We're talking the SOC and the FBI.

637
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:32,795
Add to it that
every employee here

638
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:35,497
could be considered
an accomplice and face jail time.

639
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,233
It was a fluke.

640
00:41:37,295 --> 00:41:39,741
This JOS character
just got lucky.

641
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:42,243
- Paul, this is a bad idea!
- James.

642
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:45,308
I'm the captain
of my own ship!

643
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:51,814
Paul, they're taking
your car away!

644
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:55,752
- What? Who is?
- The bank. They're repossessing it.

645
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:58,323
Why didn't you get me?!

646
00:41:58,383 --> 00:42:00,727
You asked not to be disturbed,
and they just came,

647
00:42:00,785 --> 00:42:02,423
and now they're towing it.

648
00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:09,427
Matt!

649
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:15,343
How long will it take you to put
together a full demo of Jericho?

650
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,778
- I take it it didn't go too well.
- How long?

651
00:42:17,836 --> 00:42:20,817
Well, I mean, I'd have to
get all the data put together

652
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:22,010
on 3D histograms.

653
00:42:22,073 --> 00:42:24,314
- If you want any kind of animation...
- Monday morning?

654
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,218
What happened?

655
00:42:29,314 --> 00:42:30,725
Don't ask.

656
00:42:31,516 --> 00:42:34,224
She's gonna leave
if I don't do something.

657
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:37,827
- Are you alright?
- Yes, I'm fine.

658
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:41,737
I'm just saying,
just be careful.

659
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:46,631
Yeah.

660
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:51,941
Hey, he used some variation
of a Trojan Horse

661
00:42:52,003 --> 00:42:54,347
to bypass security protocol.

662
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:58,516
What?

663
00:43:01,646 --> 00:43:03,455
That's how he bypassed
security protocol.

664
00:43:03,548 --> 00:43:04,959
What are you talking about?

665
00:43:05,383 --> 00:43:07,761
- JOS620.
- Yeah?

666
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:10,099
He got in
through the back door.

667
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:11,758
Well, can we close it?

668
00:43:13,224 --> 00:43:14,532
Probably.

669
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:18,166
I'd really like to know
who left the door open.

670
00:43:18,229 --> 00:43:22,143
The security breach
is on the inside?

671
00:43:24,669 --> 00:43:26,171
Isn't it always?

672
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:29,684
I hope not.

673
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:35,719
Can I borrow your car?

674
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:01,216
I'm here to see Mrs. Santos.

675
00:44:01,272 --> 00:44:04,219
- Would you mind dialing her up?
- No problem. One moment.

676
00:44:04,275 --> 00:44:05,379
Thank you.

677
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,590
Sir, there she goes
right there.

678
00:44:21,793 --> 00:44:22,965
Paul?

679
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,306
David, how ya doing?

680
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:30,445
What are you doing here?

681
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:35,246
I've been staying here
since Liz and I split, you know,

682
00:44:35,306 --> 00:44:37,980
until I can get my feet
on the ground and find my own place.

683
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:41,421
Yeah, I heard about that.

684
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,124
We saw you guys at church.

685
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:47,152
It came as a total shock
to Beth and I.

686
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,725
Me too.

687
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:52,267
Look, I know this
is none of my business,

688
00:44:52,757 --> 00:44:55,328
but how did you
let this happen?

689
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:59,632
- Me?
- Yeah, your affair.

690
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:02,234
I didn't have an affair.

691
00:45:03,301 --> 00:45:04,780
She did.

692
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:06,505
Liz?

693
00:45:06,571 --> 00:45:08,073
Yeah, she...

694
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:14,111
She fell in love with
some guy she met on the Internet.

695
00:45:18,249 --> 00:45:20,286
I'm sorry, we just assumed...

696
00:45:20,351 --> 00:45:22,331
- That it was the man.
- Yeah.

697
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:25,667
Yeah, not this time.

698
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:30,072
Can I buy you
a cup of coffee?

699
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,803
Actually, women
are more susceptible

700
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:36,071
to this kind of thing
than men are.

701
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:39,842
I know it sounds odd,
but they call it emotional adultery.

702
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:42,550
I'm not following.

703
00:45:42,607 --> 00:45:44,484
It's the Internet age, man.

704
00:45:44,542 --> 00:45:46,112
Where have you been?

705
00:45:46,177 --> 00:45:47,747
Happily married.

706
00:45:47,979 --> 00:45:49,424
So was I.

707
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,284
So was I.

708
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,021
It usually goes this way.

709
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:58,659
Maybe a woman is
unhappy in her marriage.

710
00:45:58,723 --> 00:46:01,294
Maybe she's bored.

711
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:04,397
Maybe she's just going through
some kind of a mid-life crisis.

712
00:46:04,462 --> 00:46:06,100
The point is there doesn't
necessarily have to be

713
00:46:06,164 --> 00:46:07,734
anything wrong in her life.

714
00:46:07,832 --> 00:46:09,334
The next thing you know

715
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,313
she starts talking to
somebody in her Zumba class,

716
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:15,249
or it could be a co-worker
in the next cubicle over.

717
00:46:15,306 --> 00:46:16,444
It could be just
somebody she sees

718
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:18,714
at a school bus stop
every morning.

719
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:21,245
It can happen anywhere,
anytime.

720
00:46:21,312 --> 00:46:22,985
What could happen?

721
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,728
She met somebody

722
00:46:28,186 --> 00:46:31,429
on an Internet chat room
intended for people

723
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:34,663
interested in investing
in the stock market.

724
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:37,137
- Liz?
- Yeah.

725
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:38,673
Come on, how did it happen?

726
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:41,801
They start off as friends,
you know?

727
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:45,876
At least that's how Liz told me
that it happened with her.

728
00:46:45,937 --> 00:46:49,578
Next thing you know, they're
talking about common interests.

729
00:46:49,674 --> 00:46:53,281
That leads to more personal
discussions about, you name it,

730
00:46:53,344 --> 00:46:56,484
intimate struggles,
doubts, feelings, fears,

731
00:46:57,782 --> 00:47:01,161
the kinda things
that should be intended

732
00:47:01,219 --> 00:47:04,530
exclusively for
a marriage relationship.

733
00:47:06,524 --> 00:47:08,561
When did they actually meet?

734
00:47:08,626 --> 00:47:11,402
I don't even think
that they have in person.

735
00:47:12,797 --> 00:47:14,777
The guy lives in Wyoming.

736
00:47:18,236 --> 00:47:20,182
But how's it an affair?

737
00:47:21,105 --> 00:47:23,016
She thinks, she...

738
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:26,613
believes

739
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:29,521
that she's gonna have
a future with this guy,

740
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:32,627
one...

741
00:47:34,652 --> 00:47:36,928
one brighter than
the one she has with...

742
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:42,699
with me.

743
00:47:48,399 --> 00:47:49,639
Hang on.

744
00:47:58,309 --> 00:48:00,118
I guess I'm gonna have to
run back to the office.

745
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:01,884
You know what
the scary thing is?

746
00:48:01,946 --> 00:48:03,186
Is that...

747
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,292
I had a good marriage.

748
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:17,373
Imagine what would happen
if someone's in a bad marriage.

749
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:27,608
Sorry I'm late.
What's up?

750
00:48:27,672 --> 00:48:29,117
You've got company.

751
00:48:30,675 --> 00:48:31,779
She's here?

752
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:37,618
Tycor, here to
keep your secrets.

753
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:42,925
Hi, Beth!

754
00:48:42,987 --> 00:48:44,967
Don't look so disappointed.

755
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:48,595
Come on, don't be silly.
I'm just... I'm surprised.

756
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:50,138
- Surprised?
- Yeah.

757
00:48:50,194 --> 00:48:53,266
Lunch today at that
new place on Tucker Street?

758
00:48:54,699 --> 00:48:56,610
I'm so sorry.

759
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:01,679
Iran into David
at his hotel,

760
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:03,810
and I spent the better part
of the day talking to him.

761
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:05,353
How is he?

762
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:08,681
He's holding on.

763
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,522
I found the bills, Paul.

764
00:49:12,583 --> 00:49:14,790
Were you ever
planning on telling me?

765
00:49:14,852 --> 00:49:17,162
I'm sorry, honey.
I just didn't want you to worry.

766
00:49:17,221 --> 00:49:18,666
I will fix it.

767
00:49:18,723 --> 00:49:21,795
Hey, Beth.
What a pleasant surprise.

768
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,705
Hello, Ryan.

769
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:30,039
I see you two are busy,
so I'll just leave you two to it.

770
00:49:30,101 --> 00:49:31,546
Wait, honey.

771
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:35,611
Look, I'm sorry.

772
00:49:35,673 --> 00:49:37,914
Let me make it
up to you, okay?

773
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:40,649
I will, promise.

774
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:43,191
It's fine.

775
00:49:43,681 --> 00:49:45,285
Good bye, Ryan.

776
00:49:45,883 --> 00:49:47,294
Bye, Beth.

777
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:50,022
Did I interrupt?

778
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:52,533
No, no, every-thing's fine.

779
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:55,526
So what's going on?

780
00:49:55,593 --> 00:49:56,663
You tell me.

781
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:58,638
Looks like we're closing
on Jericho Monday morning.

782
00:49:58,696 --> 00:50:00,437
Big day for Tycor.

783
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:02,171
That means you found JOS.

784
00:50:02,233 --> 00:50:04,713
Well, not exactly, but Matt thinks
he's got everything figured out.

785
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:06,076
It's gonna be fine.

786
00:50:06,137 --> 00:50:08,617
The BVCA is gonna want it,
and in less than 24 hours

787
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:11,118
I'm gonna be at the bank
with a commitment letter.

788
00:50:11,175 --> 00:50:13,587
That's what I'm talking about.
The crops are saved.

789
00:50:13,644 --> 00:50:15,055
The crops are saved.

790
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:19,120
Oh, Monday on the rollout,
I wanna make sure I don't miss it.

791
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:20,423
When and where?

792
00:50:20,484 --> 00:50:22,521
That's top secret, Ryan.
You know that.

793
00:50:23,054 --> 00:50:25,330
Okay, whatever,
send me a doughnut.

794
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:42,509
Hey, Matt.

795
00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:46,178
Oh, a visit from
the head of marketing.

796
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:49,781
- To what do we owe this honor?
- I hear you solved the JOS620 issue.

797
00:50:49,847 --> 00:50:51,417
No, I mean, not entirely.

798
00:50:51,482 --> 00:50:54,361
I found a hole in the security
protocol and closed it,

799
00:50:55,486 --> 00:50:57,397
but hopefully
there aren't any more.

800
00:50:57,454 --> 00:50:58,990
A hole, huh?

801
00:50:59,724 --> 00:51:01,101
Alright, well,
I just wanna make sure

802
00:51:01,158 --> 00:51:02,831
we're definitely on
for Monday morning.

803
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,395
Yeah, we're good to go.

804
00:51:04,762 --> 00:51:06,070
Alright, thanks.

805
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:11,273
Oh, and what time
is the rollout?

806
00:51:11,335 --> 00:51:13,838
I got a press release
I gotta put together.

807
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:18,014
That's on a
need-to-know basis.

808
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,748
I mean, you're gonna
have to ask Paul.

809
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:22,757
I know, but he's been
acting a little funny lately.

810
00:51:22,847 --> 00:51:26,226
Between you and me, I think
there's issues going on at home.

811
00:51:26,284 --> 00:51:29,629
I walked in on him and Beth, and
it was like World War Ill in there.

812
00:51:29,687 --> 00:51:31,030
Yeah, I was
worried about that.

813
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:34,797
So, considering all
that he's got going on,

814
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:37,099
I don't wanna bother the guy.

815
00:51:39,997 --> 00:51:42,273
Come on, hook a brother up.

816
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:49,574
Alright, 9:38 a.m.,
but you didn't hear it from me.

817
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,586
Got it.
Thanks, Buddy.

818
00:51:57,081 --> 00:51:59,561
9:38.

819
00:52:26,377 --> 00:52:28,379
Paul, are you about done?

820
00:52:28,779 --> 00:52:29,780
Almost.

821
00:52:29,847 --> 00:52:32,589
I have to pick up
flowers for service early.

822
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,027
We'll just meet you there, okay?

823
00:52:34,084 --> 00:52:36,496
Okay, I'll see you
in a little bit.

824
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:47,406
What is faithfulness?

825
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:50,406
The world has one definition.

826
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:52,505
God has another.

827
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:57,282
This can be a problem when
it comes to marital fidelity.

828
00:52:57,341 --> 00:53:01,221
We try to rationalize
what faithfulness is.

829
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:03,485
Jesus made
a powerful statement.

830
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:06,323
He said if you look on
a woman with lust in your heart,

831
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:08,329
you've already
committed adultery.

832
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:11,059
You see, we try to rationalize
with thoughts like,

833
00:53:11,122 --> 00:53:13,500
"Well, it's okay.
Everybody's doing it,"

834
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:16,629
and, "It's okay as long
as you don't get caught."

835
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:20,197
When we innocently facilitate
arrangements, for instance,

836
00:53:20,264 --> 00:53:23,370
to be with people
of the opposite sex

837
00:53:23,434 --> 00:53:24,970
who are not our spouse

838
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:28,881
and we put it under the guise of
a business meeting, that's sin.

839
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:31,579
We're headed
in the wrong direction.

840
00:53:31,642 --> 00:53:34,486
When we rationalize our thoughts
about another person,

841
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:36,388
we're diluting ourselves.

842
00:53:36,447 --> 00:53:40,224
If we find ourselves fantasizing
or manipulating events,

843
00:53:40,284 --> 00:53:43,458
it's time to make
a very fast U-turn.

844
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,969
See, that same mind
that leads us down the road of sin

845
00:53:48,025 --> 00:53:50,801
can lead us back to God
and our spouse.

846
00:53:50,861 --> 00:53:53,501
We need to daydream
about our spouse.

847
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:56,170
We need to remember
our wedding vows.

848
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:57,439
We need to ask ourselves,

849
00:53:57,501 --> 00:53:59,981
is there something
that we can do today, this week,

850
00:54:00,037 --> 00:54:03,575
right now to remind our spouse
of the intimate relationship

851
00:54:03,641 --> 00:54:05,746
that we were called
to have together?

852
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:07,345
We need to daydream about

853
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:11,052
what attracted us to our spouse
in the first place.

854
00:54:11,148 --> 00:54:15,028
See, God tells us specifically
about how to think.

855
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:18,931
He says, "Finally, brothers,
whatever is true,

856
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:22,198
whatever is noble,
whatever is right,

857
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:25,604
whatever is pure
and lovely and admirable,

858
00:54:25,696 --> 00:54:29,007
if there's anything
excellent or praiseworthy,

859
00:54:29,066 --> 00:54:31,774
think about such things."

860
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:05,605
What are they doing here?

861
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:08,679
The bank has a lot at stake.

862
00:55:08,739 --> 00:55:10,685
I hope you know
what you're doing.

863
00:55:10,741 --> 00:55:12,220
Me too.

864
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:17,352
Well...

865
00:55:18,349 --> 00:55:21,330
I'd like to thank you
all for being here.

866
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:25,990
Today marks a threshold
in information technology.

867
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:32,539
No longer will companies,
governments, individuals

868
00:55:32,596 --> 00:55:36,840
need to fear for the safety
and the protection of their data.

869
00:55:37,401 --> 00:55:43,511
Now, in exactly 10 seconds
Project Jericho will go live.

870
00:55:43,574 --> 00:55:46,487
After we demonstrate
its effectiveness,

871
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:48,181
it will be for sale.

872
00:56:11,435 --> 00:56:12,573
What?

873
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:20,149
Okay, we obviously
have a minor glitch.

874
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:24,389
Do something right away.
Thank you.

875
00:56:33,924 --> 00:56:35,198
Hey...

876
00:56:38,462 --> 00:56:39,873
Obviously,

877
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,543
there is a mistake.

878
00:56:47,805 --> 00:56:49,079
Julia.

879
00:57:29,513 --> 00:57:30,958
Julia!

880
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:33,056
Don't leave.

881
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:35,596
Julia, please!

882
00:57:36,754 --> 00:57:37,960
Julia!

883
00:57:38,555 --> 00:57:39,932
Please, don't go!

884
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:41,196
Julia!

885
00:57:41,692 --> 00:57:43,399
Julia!

886
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,404
Julia, please.

887
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:45,963
Please, I can explain everything.

888
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:47,508
No, Paul, there's no time.

889
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:51,236
You're just like
all the other men.

890
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,645
No, I'm not.
I'm not. I'm not!

891
00:57:53,937 --> 00:57:55,416
- Time's up!
- Julia, please don't go!

892
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:56,746
Julia.

893
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:58,753
Julia, please don't go.

894
00:57:59,143 --> 00:58:02,989
Julia, please don't go.

895
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:03,990
Julia.

896
00:58:04,047 --> 00:58:06,459
Paul, Paul.

897
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:08,894
Paul, wake up!

898
00:58:11,922 --> 00:58:13,094
What?

899
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:14,897
Who is Julia?

900
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:16,637
What?

901
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:19,674
You were calling
her name in your sleep.

902
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:21,732
- Is that the woman from Brazil
- No!

903
00:58:21,799 --> 00:58:22,932
That you've been spending

904
00:58:22,933 --> 00:58:23,911
-so much time with?
- No!

905
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:28,810
Yes, her name is Julia,
but nothing is going on.

906
00:58:28,872 --> 00:58:30,681
Why were you
at David's hotel?

907
00:58:30,741 --> 00:58:33,950
- Beth, please don't overreact.
- And why do you have all those

908
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:36,389
-pictures of her on your cell phone?
- Will you please let me explain?

909
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:40,258
No, Paul! I've been asking you
to explain for weeks now!

910
00:58:40,584 --> 00:58:41,995
I never touched the woman.

911
00:58:42,052 --> 00:58:44,225
It doesn't make that much
of a difference, Paul!

912
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:46,028
Don't you see that?

913
00:58:48,392 --> 00:58:50,565
You need to get
your priorities straight.

914
00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:54,268
You need to figure out what's going
on between you and this woman.

915
00:58:54,331 --> 00:58:56,811
You need to figure out
what you want, Paul!

916
00:58:58,068 --> 00:58:59,775
What do you want?

917
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:02,539
Julia, just not...

918
00:59:02,606 --> 00:59:03,880
Julia?

919
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:06,511
Seriously? Julia?

920
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:09,916
Let me do something.

921
00:59:10,013 --> 00:59:11,583
You wanna do something?

922
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:13,992
Go talk to somebody,
and in the meantime

923
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:17,396
you're gonna stay at a hotel
until you can figure this thing out!

924
00:59:17,454 --> 00:59:20,901
You're either in this marriage,
Paul, or you're not!

925
00:59:59,563 --> 01:00:02,840
I think I'm just
overthinking this.

926
01:00:02,899 --> 01:00:07,405
I mean, he said nothing happened
between the two of them,

927
01:00:07,538 --> 01:00:11,680
and the strangest thing is
that I actually believe him.

928
01:00:11,842 --> 01:00:14,516
Beth, please,
don't kid yourself.

929
01:00:14,911 --> 01:00:18,358
From what you've told me
this sounds like...

930
01:00:21,084 --> 01:00:23,325
It sounds like infidelity.

931
01:00:24,354 --> 01:00:27,801
The experts might have
a fancy word for it now,

932
01:00:27,858 --> 01:00:32,398
but where I come from, they call it
unfaithfulness of the heart.

933
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:36,507
But men are
gonna be men, right?

934
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:38,344
I just...

935
01:00:38,869 --> 01:00:41,873
I feel like I'm making
too big of a deal of this.

936
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:46,409
It's probably
just harmless flirtation.

937
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:49,514
You know, that's what's
wrong with our generation now.

938
01:00:49,913 --> 01:00:51,358
One of the biggest things

939
01:00:51,415 --> 01:00:56,330
in the way of marital fidelity
these days is rationalization.

940
01:00:57,354 --> 01:00:58,992
I mean, there's
more to honesty

941
01:00:59,055 --> 01:01:02,559
than, "It's okay as long
as you don't get caught,"

942
01:01:02,626 --> 01:01:06,073
or, "It's not that bad.
Everybody's doing it."

943
01:01:07,797 --> 01:01:11,540
Listen, Satan loses
a major battle

944
01:01:11,602 --> 01:01:15,914
when we stop asking what's
wrong with certain choices

945
01:01:15,972 --> 01:01:20,284
but instead we start asking
what's right with them.

946
01:01:25,949 --> 01:01:27,519
What do I do?

947
01:01:32,222 --> 01:01:33,895
Trust the Lord.

948
01:01:34,391 --> 01:01:35,995
He is faithful.

949
01:01:41,765 --> 01:01:44,575
Excuse me, could you ring up
Ms. Santos' room, please?

950
01:01:44,634 --> 01:01:46,045
Certainly, sir.

951
01:01:46,103 --> 01:01:47,480
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

952
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:50,814
It appears Ms. Santos
has checked out of the hotel.

953
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:52,915
No, that's not possible.

954
01:01:52,976 --> 01:01:55,513
She would have told me
she was leaving.

955
01:01:58,115 --> 01:02:00,095
Maybe she checked in
to another hotel?

956
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:01,959
Did she take
her luggage with her?

957
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:04,089
I'm afraid I can't reveal
that kind of personal...

958
01:02:04,154 --> 01:02:06,156
Did she take
her luggage with her?

959
01:02:07,758 --> 01:02:08,998
I'm sorry.

960
01:02:09,526 --> 01:02:10,732
Please.

961
01:02:12,762 --> 01:02:15,333
I'm afraid I can't reveal
that kind of personal information.

962
01:02:15,399 --> 01:02:16,878
Come on, please.

963
01:02:25,442 --> 01:02:26,443
Oh, look.

964
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:28,922
It appears the hotel shuttle
brought her to the airport

965
01:02:28,979 --> 01:02:30,151
early this morning.

966
01:02:31,781 --> 01:02:32,987
Thank you.

967
01:02:33,517 --> 01:02:35,519
- Julia?
- The bank is here, Paul!

968
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:37,189
I've been trying
to get a hold of you.

969
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:40,462
They've got a court order saying
we need to vacate the premises.

970
01:02:40,524 --> 01:02:41,559
Where are you?

971
01:02:41,625 --> 01:02:43,627
Okay, Brenda, I will take care
of everything.

972
01:02:43,693 --> 01:02:45,400
Just put Ryan on the phone.

973
01:02:45,462 --> 01:02:47,169
I don't know where Ryan is.

974
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:50,541
People are jumping ship, Paul,
and James is in his office right now

975
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,604
-with the FBI or SOC!
-Look, I will fix this!

976
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:56,709
Ryan...
Just one second.

977
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,719
Ryan...
You'd better stop it!

978
01:03:00,577 --> 01:03:03,820
Now earlier another CEO,
Frank Devlin, from SYS-Tek,

979
01:03:03,914 --> 01:03:05,291
which, of course, is a giant

980
01:03:05,348 --> 01:03:07,692
in the field
of information security,

981
01:03:07,751 --> 01:03:09,628
he suddenly unleashed
a whole barrage of...

982
01:03:09,686 --> 01:03:11,757
Guys, hush!
I can't hear!

983
01:03:11,822 --> 01:03:14,428
Cooper, you and your sister,
go outside and play!

984
01:03:14,491 --> 01:03:16,225
We've got a couple of clips
of that we wanna show you,

985
01:03:16,226 --> 01:03:18,467
and then we'll talk about it
when we come back. Watch this.

986
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:21,971
- Hello?
- Beth, is that you? It's Matt.

987
01:03:22,032 --> 01:03:22,942
Matt!

988
01:03:22,999 --> 01:03:25,377
I really need to speak to your
husband. Do you know where he is?

989
01:03:25,435 --> 01:03:26,971
Is Paul in trouble?

990
01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:30,113
It's not over yet.

991
01:03:30,173 --> 01:03:32,016
One thing Paul knew
how to do is lock it down.

992
01:03:32,075 --> 01:03:34,248
I don't understand.
What's going on?

993
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:35,483
Just find Paul.

994
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:38,024
Tell him I found JOS620.

995
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:43,794
- Paul?
- David, hey, thanks for coming.

996
01:03:43,854 --> 01:03:46,130
- I really appreciate it.
- Yeah, man. You alright?

997
01:03:46,189 --> 01:03:48,692
No, I'm good.
Everything's good.

998
01:03:48,759 --> 01:03:53,572
I just, I was thinking
about Liz, you know and...

999
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,438
her thing.

1000
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:01,106
Her affair?

1001
01:04:01,438 --> 01:04:03,884
Yeah, I mean,
that's just silly.

1002
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:05,715
Why is it an affair?

1003
01:04:08,478 --> 01:04:09,980
What have you done?

1004
01:04:10,747 --> 01:04:12,351
I haven't done anything.

1005
01:04:12,415 --> 01:04:13,951
Well, who is she?

1006
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:19,099
She works for...

1007
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:25,868
She represents a company
I've been doing business with,

1008
01:04:26,096 --> 01:04:29,475
and I need them.

1009
01:04:29,533 --> 01:04:31,843
I could lose everything.

1010
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:35,580
I need her.

1011
01:04:40,644 --> 01:04:42,021
Her?

1012
01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:48,124
Does Beth know?

1013
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:51,222
Look, l wasn't looking
for anything, okay?

1014
01:04:51,288 --> 01:04:54,269
I didn't mean for
any of this to happen.

1015
01:04:54,324 --> 01:04:57,134
I have a happy marriage.

1016
01:04:57,193 --> 01:05:00,299
You know what happens
when you play with fire?

1017
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:05,301
There's a reason why Jesus said,
"if you even look at a woman..."

1018
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:08,747
Nobody takes
that seriously.

1019
01:05:11,941 --> 01:05:14,353
You think Jesus just
liked to hear himself talk?

1020
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:16,652
Think it's meant
to just be good advice?

1021
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:18,453
It's a warning, Paul.

1022
01:05:18,515 --> 01:05:22,554
You really wanna
leave Beth like me?

1023
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:24,922
It's complicated.

1024
01:05:25,288 --> 01:05:26,790
Not really.

1025
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:30,200
You're either in
or you're out.

1026
01:05:31,194 --> 01:05:32,867
Yeah, that's what she said.

1027
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:37,768
I haven't done
anything wrong.

1028
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:40,071
I know what I'm doing.

1029
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:43,216
Do you?

1030
01:05:45,675 --> 01:05:46,813
Yeah.

1031
01:05:49,613 --> 01:05:50,887
Do you?

1032
01:05:58,188 --> 01:06:00,498
You think I'm insane,
don't you?

1033
01:06:00,557 --> 01:06:01,900
Not at all.

1034
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:05,633
I mean, your situation is
more common than you might think,

1035
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:09,165
but you haven't told me
why you come to Brazil.

1036
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:14,673
I gotta get to the BVCA
before Julia gives her report.

1037
01:06:14,738 --> 01:06:17,150
I gotta convince them
I'm a safe bet.

1038
01:06:18,675 --> 01:06:21,986
Shouldn't you be at home taking
care of your wife and kids?

1039
01:06:22,045 --> 01:06:24,355
If I can straighten this
out in Brazil,

1040
01:06:24,447 --> 01:06:26,222
the rest will
take care of itself.

1041
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:28,159
I see.

1042
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:30,664
I'll tell you what,
my friend,

1043
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,722
you should come
to the church tonight

1044
01:06:32,789 --> 01:06:34,735
when we land
at Rio de Janeiro.

1045
01:06:34,791 --> 01:06:36,737
Do you have
something that I...

1046
01:06:36,793 --> 01:06:38,704
Like a card,
like a business card,

1047
01:06:38,762 --> 01:06:43,040
something that I can
write down the address?

1048
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:45,669
Can you just
write on the back of that?

1049
01:06:48,705 --> 01:06:50,013
Sure.

1050
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:52,520
You're gonna love it.
I mean,

1051
01:06:52,575 --> 01:06:56,022
the music is great,
and the company's even better.

1052
01:07:01,651 --> 01:07:03,824
- Maybe.
- Come on, man, please.

1053
01:07:03,887 --> 01:07:04,922
Allow me to introduce you

1054
01:07:04,988 --> 01:07:07,969
to some of the Brazilian
Christian hospitality.

1055
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:11,270
We'll see.

1056
01:07:37,921 --> 01:07:40,231
Where are you going, mister?

1057
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:43,896
I'm sorry, English.

1058
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:45,962
- G Gringo?
- Yes.

1059
01:07:46,029 --> 01:07:47,770
Where you going, sir?

1060
01:07:53,970 --> 01:07:56,473
Sir, where you going?

1061
01:08:01,611 --> 01:08:02,885
Sorry.

1062
01:08:05,415 --> 01:08:06,655
Okay.

1063
01:08:14,524 --> 01:08:19,303
Oh, Lord, I just give you
this whole situation.

1064
01:08:19,629 --> 01:08:21,609
I give you my husband.

1065
01:08:21,664 --> 01:08:23,666
I give you my marriage.

1066
01:08:23,733 --> 01:08:25,679
Father, do a miracle.

1067
01:08:25,735 --> 01:08:28,875
Strengthen me
to walk by faith.

1068
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:31,145
Give Paul wisdom.

1069
01:08:31,207 --> 01:08:34,381
Help him to go
the right way, Father.

1070
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:43,791
I trust that you'll
do this, Father.

1071
01:08:43,853 --> 01:08:45,799
I know you will.

1072
01:08:49,392 --> 01:08:53,135
Make our marriage stronger
than it's ever been before.

1073
01:08:54,397 --> 01:08:56,070
I thank you, Father.

1074
01:08:56,733 --> 01:08:59,043
In Jesus' name I pray.

1075
01:08:59,903 --> 01:09:01,177
Amen.

1076
01:09:08,778 --> 01:09:11,782
There is no wrong.

1077
01:09:16,419 --> 01:09:18,592
You're either in it,
or you're not.

1078
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:24,870
I have yet to meet
a man like you.

1079
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:32,707
Sometimes God tests us,
but the choice is ours.

1080
01:09:33,203 --> 01:09:36,309
Will we choose to obey him?

1081
01:09:55,491 --> 01:09:57,027
I'm sorry.

1082
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:10,446
Here we are, sir.

1083
01:10:12,141 --> 01:10:13,415
Okay...

1084
01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:17,221
- American money okay?
- Yes.

1085
01:10:18,848 --> 01:10:20,259
Thank you.

1086
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:24,929
- Have a good night.
- Good luck.

1087
01:12:55,405 --> 01:12:57,078
Please forgive me.

1088
01:12:59,142 --> 01:13:00,985
I choose you, Lord.

1089
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:04,953
I choose you.

1090
01:13:06,482 --> 01:13:09,929
Please give me the strength
to be the man

1091
01:13:11,854 --> 01:13:13,800
you want me to be.

1092
01:13:42,352 --> 01:13:43,524
Beth,

1093
01:13:44,887 --> 01:13:46,230
it's me.

1094
01:13:49,025 --> 01:13:50,663
Are you okay?

1095
01:13:54,097 --> 01:13:57,044
Yeah, I'm fine.

1096
01:13:58,901 --> 01:14:01,677
In fact, I've never been
better in my whole life.

1097
01:14:05,141 --> 01:14:06,586
I love you, Beth.

1098
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:14,257
I love you, too.

1099
01:14:19,021 --> 01:14:20,398
I'll see you soon?

1100
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:24,366
Okay.

1101
01:14:34,037 --> 01:14:37,849
I wanna thank you
for seeing me.

1102
01:14:38,741 --> 01:14:44,521
I originally
came here to explain,

1103
01:14:46,282 --> 01:14:49,957
to ask for another chance,
to beg for another chance,

1104
01:14:52,155 --> 01:14:56,865
but I think what I really
must do here is just apologize.

1105
01:14:57,794 --> 01:15:00,832
I promised full
transparency,

1106
01:15:00,897 --> 01:15:04,174
and yet I concealed
damaging information.

1107
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:09,472
I lied about the progress
of our flagship product,

1108
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:16,390
and I allowed myself to become
distracted by Ms. Santos,

1109
01:15:18,047 --> 01:15:22,393
to the point where I ignored my
responsibilities to my company,

1110
01:15:23,286 --> 01:15:26,859
to my wife, and my family.

1111
01:15:28,424 --> 01:15:33,897
Are you saying Julia Santos
acted inappropriately?

1112
01:15:33,963 --> 01:15:37,843
No, no, not at all.
The problem...

1113
01:15:40,069 --> 01:15:41,844
The problem was all mine,

1114
01:15:43,706 --> 01:15:45,413
and I apologize,

1115
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:48,446
and I ask
for your forgiveness.

1116
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,223
Thank you for your time.

1117
01:15:58,521 --> 01:15:59,727
Paul.

1118
01:16:01,524 --> 01:16:02,798
Julia.

1119
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:05,963
I heard what you did,

1120
01:16:06,028 --> 01:16:09,009
and I would like to thank you
for your honesty.

1121
01:16:12,201 --> 01:16:15,671
I would like to offer you
my personal services

1122
01:16:15,738 --> 01:16:18,810
as a tour guide
if you'd like.

1123
01:16:20,677 --> 01:16:22,623
Thank you, Julia, but...

1124
01:16:25,014 --> 01:16:27,392
I need to get home
to my family.

1125
01:16:28,251 --> 01:16:30,458
Hope you can understand that.

1126
01:16:35,558 --> 01:16:37,663
She's a lucky woman, Paul.

1127
01:16:41,964 --> 01:16:43,409
No.

1128
01:16:44,167 --> 01:16:45,908
I'm the lucky one.

1129
01:16:48,805 --> 01:16:51,615
I wanna see a different me

1130
01:16:53,276 --> 01:16:57,088
I wanna change my dream

1131
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:02,459
I wanna feel again

1132
01:17:02,518 --> 01:17:05,362
Like it's supposed to be

1133
01:17:06,856 --> 01:17:09,894
I wanna change my mind

1134
01:17:11,461 --> 01:17:14,840
I wanna fix my heart

1135
01:17:16,399 --> 01:17:19,243
Open up my window

1136
01:17:20,903 --> 01:17:24,282
Just to scare off the dark

1137
01:17:26,008 --> 01:17:29,854
Who

1138
01:17:30,579 --> 01:17:34,186
Who

1139
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:38,830
Who

1140
01:17:40,156 --> 01:17:42,466
Who cares?

1141
01:17:43,759 --> 01:17:46,171
When the romance is gone

1142
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:51,068
Removed it from my song

1143
01:17:52,902 --> 01:17:56,247
Touch my lips with a kiss

1144
01:17:57,239 --> 01:18:02,313
The Great Wall of China
is 2500 miles long,

1145
01:18:03,479 --> 01:18:06,221
too tall to climb,
too thick to knock down,

1146
01:18:06,282 --> 01:18:08,785
too long to go around,

1147
01:18:08,851 --> 01:18:12,594
and yet China
was invaded 3 times,

1148
01:18:12,655 --> 01:18:16,467
3 times in the first 100 years
of the Wall's existence.

1149
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:18,266
H ow?

1150
01:18:18,661 --> 01:18:22,302
Their enemies bribed a guard,

1151
01:18:22,365 --> 01:18:25,505
and they simply walked on
through an open gate.

1152
01:18:26,936 --> 01:18:30,383
They spent so much effort
in the building of the Wall

1153
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:33,784
but not enough in the building
of the character

1154
01:18:34,243 --> 01:18:35,881
of the gatekeeper.

1155
01:18:38,147 --> 01:18:39,990
I'm the gatekeeper,

1156
01:18:41,784 --> 01:18:44,526
and my lack of character
in recent weeks

1157
01:18:46,355 --> 01:18:48,266
allowed an enemy in.

1158
01:18:54,296 --> 01:18:55,900
I would like you to meet

1159
01:18:57,333 --> 01:18:59,335
JOS620.

1160
01:18:59,401 --> 01:19:01,381
Alex?

1161
01:19:02,338 --> 01:19:04,909
Well, actually, it's not JOS.

1162
01:19:04,974 --> 01:19:09,116
It's Joshua, as in Joshua,
chapter 6, verse 20.

1163
01:19:09,178 --> 01:19:11,180
He hacked Jericho.

1164
01:19:11,247 --> 01:19:13,193
Yeah, I used a horn...

1165
01:19:13,249 --> 01:19:15,627
Actually, it was
supposed to be a clue.

1166
01:19:15,685 --> 01:19:17,596
I left a bunch of clues.

1167
01:19:17,653 --> 01:19:20,327
In the Bible,
Joshua invaded Jericho

1168
01:19:20,389 --> 01:19:23,131
when the surrounding
walls of the city collapsed,

1169
01:19:23,192 --> 01:19:24,899
but before that he had help.

1170
01:19:24,961 --> 01:19:26,599
He had someone on the inside.

1171
01:19:26,662 --> 01:19:28,141
- Rahab.
- Yeah.

1172
01:19:28,197 --> 01:19:29,972
Why are you
telling us this, Alex?

1173
01:19:30,032 --> 01:19:31,477
Paul, can we get on with it?

1174
01:19:31,534 --> 01:19:33,605
This kid is disrupting
our meeting.

1175
01:19:33,669 --> 01:19:36,172
I'd like to hear what
he has to say, please.

1176
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:37,876
Go on, Alex.

1177
01:19:38,974 --> 01:19:41,352
Well, at first the guy said

1178
01:19:41,577 --> 01:19:44,217
that you always invite hackers
to test the system

1179
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:45,850
and I'd be
helping you guys out,

1180
01:19:45,915 --> 01:19:48,896
but after a while I figured
something was wrong.

1181
01:19:48,951 --> 01:19:52,091
Okay, so, are you telling me
that someone in my own company

1182
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:55,428
hacked our own system?

1183
01:19:56,325 --> 01:19:57,804
Who?

1184
01:19:57,860 --> 01:19:59,567
I don't know.
We never met.

1185
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:01,767
I only talked to him
over the phone.

1186
01:20:01,831 --> 01:20:03,936
Paul, honestly,
this is ridiculous.

1187
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,105
We are wasting
these people's time.

1188
01:20:06,168 --> 01:20:07,579
Go on.

1189
01:20:34,597 --> 01:20:37,203
What does this prove?
It proves nothing!

1190
01:20:37,266 --> 01:20:39,075
My ringer was left on?

1191
01:20:43,372 --> 01:20:44,851
Get off me!

1192
01:20:45,408 --> 01:20:46,785
Let go!

1193
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:52,959
I should've seen it.

1194
01:20:53,549 --> 01:20:58,157
I should've done my job,
but I was distracted.

1195
01:20:58,988 --> 01:21:00,831
For that I'm sorry.

1196
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:06,135
Sometimes the greatest
enemy to combat

1197
01:21:07,596 --> 01:21:08,973
is the one within.

1198
01:21:09,598 --> 01:21:11,100
No fortress,

1199
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:13,540
no lock, no wall

1200
01:21:16,372 --> 01:21:18,477
can keep you from yourself.

1201
01:21:21,544 --> 01:21:24,650
I'm sorry to all of you.

1202
01:21:24,747 --> 01:21:26,283
Again, I apologize.

1203
01:21:26,348 --> 01:21:31,058
I will do better
in the future.

1204
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:34,158
Alex, thank you.
I appreciate you being here.

1205
01:21:52,108 --> 01:21:53,587
Why'd he do it?

1206
01:21:53,642 --> 01:21:55,918
He was working with SYS-Tek.

1207
01:21:56,045 --> 01:21:57,820
They paid him a lot of money
to convince us

1208
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:00,690
that Jericho didn't work,
so we'd abandon it.

1209
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:03,662
After that, he was probably
gonna sell it to them.

1210
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:06,024
Matt, you wanna tell him?

1211
01:22:06,088 --> 01:22:08,830
Well, my friend,
I don't know what you did,

1212
01:22:08,891 --> 01:22:11,462
but you made quite
an impression over in Brazil.

1213
01:22:11,527 --> 01:22:12,767
What are you talking about?

1214
01:22:12,828 --> 01:22:15,069
The BVCA wants to
give us another shot.

1215
01:22:15,131 --> 01:22:16,166
No way.

1216
01:22:16,232 --> 01:22:18,473
- Yeah, and our wonder boy, Alex...
- Yeah?

1217
01:22:18,534 --> 01:22:21,344
Apparently, he's figuring out
the missing element to our system.

1218
01:22:21,403 --> 01:22:24,179
You've gotta be kidding me.
Oh, this is gonna be amazing.

1219
01:22:47,463 --> 01:22:49,067
Yes.

1220
01:22:49,498 --> 01:22:52,604
Operator, I'd like to
place an overseas call, please,

1221
01:22:53,102 --> 01:22:54,672
to Rio de Janeiro.

1222
01:22:56,405 --> 01:22:57,611
That's right.

1223
01:22:59,575 --> 01:23:00,849
Brazil.

1224
01:23:04,613 --> 01:23:07,992
We gather here today
to celebrate the love

1225
01:23:08,050 --> 01:23:10,860
that Paul and Beth
share together

1226
01:23:10,919 --> 01:23:13,661
as they renew their vows
before God.

1227
01:23:13,722 --> 01:23:16,032
I'm sorry, can you hang on?

1228
01:23:16,091 --> 01:23:17,934
Marcos, come here.

1229
01:23:18,527 --> 01:23:20,006
Come here.

1230
01:23:20,896 --> 01:23:23,308
Come here! Hurry up.

1231
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,241
- I couldn't miss it.
- Thank you so much for being here.

1232
01:23:27,303 --> 01:23:29,442
Hey everybody,
this is Pastor Marcos,

1233
01:23:29,505 --> 01:23:30,643
a very good friend of mine.

1234
01:23:30,706 --> 01:23:33,346
He came all the way from Brazil
to be here with us today.

1235
01:23:33,409 --> 01:23:35,389
It means so much to me.

1236
01:23:35,477 --> 01:23:37,457
I'll explain it to you later.

1237
01:23:37,513 --> 01:23:39,515
Thank you for being here.
I appreciate it.

1238
01:23:39,682 --> 01:23:40,786
Alright.

1239
01:23:41,851 --> 01:23:45,424
When two people renew
their vows before the Lord,

1240
01:23:45,488 --> 01:23:48,059
it's a holy
and a profound moment.

1241
01:23:48,123 --> 01:23:51,400
It's profound because of the
day and age in which we live.

1242
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:54,304
Certain things
don't happen often.

1243
01:23:54,363 --> 01:23:57,640
These two people right now have
declared before Mighty God

1244
01:23:57,699 --> 01:23:59,474
that, first of all,
they made it.

1245
01:23:59,535 --> 01:24:01,276
They defied the odds.

1246
01:24:01,336 --> 01:24:03,816
Twenty years is a milestone.

1247
01:24:03,872 --> 01:24:06,318
My prayer
for each one of you

1248
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:09,584
is that your love would
continue to grow and blossom,

1249
01:24:09,678 --> 01:24:11,680
that you'll rely
on God's strength

1250
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:13,726
and the support
of family and friends

1251
01:24:13,782 --> 01:24:17,787
and your commitment that you
make towards one another today.

1252
01:24:18,654 --> 01:24:21,635
Pastor Marcos, would you
like to say a few words?

1253
01:24:24,226 --> 01:24:27,730
I understand you two
have written your own vows

1254
01:24:27,796 --> 01:24:32,108
and provided copies
to all those here to read along.

1255
01:24:32,167 --> 01:24:33,646
Thank you.

1256
01:24:37,773 --> 01:24:40,982
Sweetheart, 20 years ago

1257
01:24:41,944 --> 01:24:44,356
I was asked to say, "I do",

1258
01:24:45,948 --> 01:24:47,359
and I did.

1259
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:50,324
At our wedding ceremony,
l chose

1260
01:24:52,254 --> 01:24:56,100
you to be my wife.

1261
01:24:57,426 --> 01:25:01,431
I promised to live with you
according to God's holy Word.

1262
01:25:01,897 --> 01:25:05,606
I swore to stand by you
for better or worse,

1263
01:25:06,068 --> 01:25:07,604
in sickness and health,

1264
01:25:09,004 --> 01:25:11,507
to renounce all others,

1265
01:25:12,307 --> 01:25:14,548
and give myself to only you

1266
01:25:15,410 --> 01:25:17,515
for all the days
of our lives,

1267
01:25:18,447 --> 01:25:20,154
and I did that.

1268
01:25:23,252 --> 01:25:24,697
Today,

1269
01:25:26,521 --> 01:25:30,492
again, I choose you
to be my wife,

1270
01:25:31,727 --> 01:25:33,798
and I stand here today

1271
01:25:35,664 --> 01:25:37,109
with you

1272
01:25:38,434 --> 01:25:40,038
for better or worse,

1273
01:25:42,104 --> 01:25:45,415
in sickness and health,

1274
01:25:46,075 --> 01:25:47,952
and today and every day

1275
01:25:51,346 --> 01:25:53,519
I renounce all others.

1276
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:58,129
I'll give myself to you
and only you,

1277
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:03,163
and every day
that we share by God's grace

1278
01:26:05,193 --> 01:26:10,040
I will always promise
to always love,

1279
01:26:10,098 --> 01:26:15,013
to always honor,
to always comfort and keep you.

1280
01:26:39,995 --> 01:26:41,633
David, I'm sorry.

1281
01:26:48,670 --> 01:26:50,081
Please forgive me.

1282
01:27:04,186 --> 01:27:05,859
I love you, David.

1283
01:27:08,157 --> 01:27:10,000
I love you, too, Liz.

1284
01:27:15,531 --> 01:27:17,169
I love you, too.

1285
01:27:19,601 --> 01:27:21,103
So...

1286
01:27:26,808 --> 01:27:28,116
Beth Tyson,

1287
01:27:30,512 --> 01:27:32,219
I love you so much.

1288
01:27:36,919 --> 01:27:39,195
Will you again

1289
01:27:43,458 --> 01:27:46,530
be my wife and say, "I do"?

1290
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:51,338
I did,

1291
01:27:54,603 --> 01:27:55,673
I do,

1292
01:27:58,340 --> 01:28:00,149
and I always will.

1293
01:28:03,478 --> 01:28:05,458
We now pronounce you...

1294
01:28:05,514 --> 01:28:07,425
Hold it.
Re-pronounce.

1295
01:28:07,483 --> 01:28:11,056
Re-pronounce you
Mr. and Mrs. Tyson.

1296
01:28:11,253 --> 01:28:14,427
I tried to find my worth

1297
01:28:14,757 --> 01:28:17,795
In things that didn't work

1298
01:28:18,827 --> 01:28:22,969
My confidence was broken

1299
01:28:23,031 --> 01:28:25,170
I was hopeless

1300
01:28:25,234 --> 01:28:30,206
But God,
you have made me new

1301
01:28:30,272 --> 01:28:35,187
You've restored my heart

1302
01:28:35,277 --> 01:28:40,022
And turned
these ashes into life

1303
01:28:42,384 --> 01:28:47,959
Oh God, you have
pulled me through

1304
01:28:48,023 --> 01:28:52,665
And everything I was is gone

1305
01:28:52,728 --> 01:28:55,675
It washed away for good

1306
01:28:57,833 --> 01:29:01,747
I'm a new man in you

1307
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:09,713
I'm trying
to walk as a new man

1308
01:29:09,811 --> 01:29:16,057
I want you to show me
who I am in you

1309
01:29:16,118 --> 01:29:21,625
When I forget that I'm yours

1310
01:29:23,225 --> 01:29:25,603
Now I've found my worth

1311
01:29:25,661 --> 01:29:31,236
It is set in stone
and in stone for good

1312
01:29:31,299 --> 01:29:36,840
'Cause God,
you have pulled me through

1313
01:29:36,905 --> 01:29:40,717
And everything
I was is gone

1314
01:29:40,776 --> 01:29:44,519
It washed away for good

1315
01:29:45,213 --> 01:29:49,855
I'm a new man in you

1316
01:30:04,566 --> 01:30:11,245
Oh God, you have made me new

1317
01:30:11,673 --> 01:30:14,654
You've restored my heart

1318
01:30:14,710 --> 01:30:19,090
And turned
these ashes into life

1319
01:30:21,783 --> 01:30:27,392
Oh God, you have
pulled me through

1320
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:32,030
And everything I was is gone

1321
01:30:32,093 --> 01:30:36,599
It washed away for good

1322
01:30:37,499 --> 01:30:41,242
And everything I was is gone

1323
01:30:41,303 --> 01:30:45,046
It washed away for good

1324
01:30:45,774 --> 01:30:51,622
I'm a new man in you
