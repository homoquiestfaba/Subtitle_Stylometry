1
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,050
"24 HOURS TO DIE"

2
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,799
Your dog is beautiful.

3
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:11,750
What's his name?
- Pooch! We call Pooch.

4
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:15,500
Hey, Pooch? Come here!
Good girl.

5
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:17,900
Look.

6
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:26,399
She's awesome. Remember the dog
I had as a child.

7
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:28,199
Napoleon ...

8
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,699
That dog was crazy.

9
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,099
Do not remember you.
Live around here?

10
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,699
We lived here for years,
with Pooch.

11
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,098
Right ...
Can you do me a favor?

12
00:02:46,298 --> 00:02:47,798
You can get in the car?

13
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:51,199
- What?
- The car.

14
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,899
Get in the car.

15
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,098
Frances, see this.

16
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:03,798
Now coming in?
Get in the car!

17
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:08,199
Help! Help!

18
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,798
They'll kill me?

19
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,699
They'll kill me?

20
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:30,899
I want the money from her husband.

21
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:35,699
He can give you.
Can you give all you want.

22
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:39,500
Hope you keep alive,
really.

23
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
Looks like a nice person.

24
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:47,900
It will not bury me alive, are you?

25
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:51,900
Can not do that.
Can not bury me alive.

26
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:55,900
Please, can not
do this. You can not!

27
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:00,098
I implore you, for God's sake.
Please do not.

28
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:03,500
- Handsome, how are you there?
- Near the end.

29
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,500
Help, please!
Help!

30
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:10,598
- No one will hear you.
- Help!

31
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:14,500
Do not shout, no one will hear you.

32
00:04:15,298 --> 00:04:16,300
Nobody.

33
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:20,098
Nobody.
Well ...

34
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,800
Get undressed.

35
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:34,199
Got enough air
for a day, Frances ...

36
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,000
... If not panic.

37
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,098
No, please!
Wait! Please!

38
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,500
Come on.

39
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,199
I'm afraid of the dark, please!
Give me a torch! I beg you!

40
00:04:45,598 --> 00:04:47,699
- Come on.
- Please, a flashlight!

41
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:50,199
We could give her.

42
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,000
No!

43
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,699
No! Please!
I beg you, please!

44
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,300
Shut up, Frances.
Shut the hell up ...

45
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,098
or not to tell anyone where it is.
The decision is yours.

46
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,000
Bury it, or will be next.

47
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,000
Please give me the flashlight.
Please!

48
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,199
A flashlight.
Please. Please.

49
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,098
No, please!

50
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,098
Please, no!

51
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:38,500
Handsome, you do not
want to do it!

52
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,699
Please let me out!
Let me out!

53
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,900
Let me out!
Let me out!

54
00:05:57,699 --> 00:05:59,100
Get me outta here!

55
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,800
This town is too hot.

56
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:35,598
Today two boys of 10 and 11 years
entered a shop on the second. Av

57
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,500
They were armed.

58
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,500
The weapons were unloaded,
but the clerk did not know.

59
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:45,399
Was Pakistani.
He thought it was going to die.

60
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,899
He handed over the money, right?

61
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:54,500
No! No, the boys thought
was in the bag, they would get.

62
00:06:55,899 --> 00:06:58,800
$ 20 would be rich one day.

63
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,199
Just did not know that
Pakistani was crazy.

64
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:05,899
While the boys surrendered,
He reached into his desk ...

65
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:10,000
grabbed a pistol and began
throwing candy on the shelf.

66
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,899
I arrived ten minutes later. The
boys were on the floor, dead ...

67
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,899
there was blood everywhere, and the
guy was eating chocolate ...

68
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,899
drinking soda and saying:
"These marginal asked."

69
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:29,399
"These marginal asked."
Time and time again.

70
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,500
I hate summer. The people throwing out
because he is a hothead.

71
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:46,699
What is it? I'll buy you a Coke.
It will cool your head.

72
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,098
Why not pay me
a beer?

73
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,500
Funny.

74
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:01,399
It was not, but so what?

75
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:13,149
Do not worry Tim If you happen
again, I speak with my husband.

76
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:16,899
Is this true?
Talk to me?

77
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:21,500
Maddy ... Honey?

78
00:08:28,098 --> 00:08:30,199
Not in service, remember?

79
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:34,700
What have you got?

80
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,200
It's 10-85.

81
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,200
- I can not do anything.
- I can.

82
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:44,498
Ask the radio-enhancement of the subway.
-Wait.

83
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:46,399
Excuse me.

84
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,099
Damn!

85
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:53,899
Step aside.

86
00:08:54,998 --> 00:08:58,099
- What is happening?
- Out! Get out! Get out!

87
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:09,099
Step aside!

88
00:09:10,998 --> 00:09:12,099
What the hell ...

89
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:57,498
Step aside!

90
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:59,099
- Beware!
- My goodness!

91
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,099
Stop, please!

92
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,099
Careful, you idiot!.

93
00:10:30,599 --> 00:10:31,498
On foot!

94
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:35,998
Show your hands and stand!
Not you!

95
00:10:36,998 --> 00:10:41,498
I'm a cop.
I want to show their hands ...

96
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,200
and stand up now!

97
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:55,998
Get down!
He's armed!

98
00:11:16,498 --> 00:11:18,200
Hurry!
You are going to the subway!

99
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,099
- Get him on the subway!
- Let's get him!

100
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,998
- He is coming!
- Get down! He's down!

101
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,200
Do not you even move!

102
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,700
You bitch!

103
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,200
Ready, Detective.
Let us take care of him.

104
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,299
My goodness!

105
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:56,899
Hello?

106
00:12:57,599 --> 00:13:00,099
- It's me.
- I knew you'd call again.

107
00:13:01,498 --> 00:13:04,799
- Where have you been?
- Busy.

108
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,100
Want to come over?

109
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,099
Are you sure?

110
00:13:14,998 --> 00:13:15,998
So tell me.

111
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,799
- I want to go there.
- No way.

112
00:13:23,599 --> 00:13:25,799
- Say again.
- I want to ...

113
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:31,998
I want to go there.

114
00:13:34,998 --> 00:13:35,599
Again.

115
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,299
I want to.
Please.

116
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,200
I want to go there.

117
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,200
Want some?

118
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,498
I want to.

119
00:15:16,099 --> 00:15:16,799
Do you?

120
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:26,700
Please.

121
00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:22,799
Hey shooter!

122
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:28,399
Where were you?
I'm beeping you half an hour ago!

123
00:16:29,498 --> 00:16:32,698
- I'm not in service.
- No more answers his pager?

124
00:16:34,998 --> 00:16:37,299
Is in the bag.
What do you want?

125
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:41,200
I iron, if we are to
precinct. Get in the car.

126
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,400
What happened?

127
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,498
- Kidnapping. We are in search.

128
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:51,099
Jess, I am not
feeling good.

129
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,800
It is not a party, okay?
We both have to go fast.

130
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,498
Or Tim's going to kill us.
Do yourself a favor ...

131
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,000
Suck bales.
You can pick up.

132
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,200
It smells to drink.

133
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:26,700
Caramba!

134
00:17:48,296 --> 00:17:49,099
Damn!

135
00:18:00,099 --> 00:18:01,099
Fuck you!

136
00:18:10,099 --> 00:18:10,900
Damn it!

137
00:18:16,046 --> 00:18:18,296
C'mon!
BHP!

138
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,900
Sorry.

139
00:18:26,796 --> 00:18:29,296
We must go,
he has begun meeting.

140
00:18:29,796 --> 00:18:31,296
I'm going.

141
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,900
Damn!

142
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:56,400
Foster already know and Dillon.
Are also in this case.

143
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,998
- One more minute, and would not.
- How lucky to be married to the boss.

144
00:19:02,296 --> 00:19:05,900
Madeline, Jesse,
this is Clark Hannon.

145
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,796
You may not know that he
owns a collection of art ...

146
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,349
worth millions of dollars.

147
00:19:13,099 --> 00:19:15,998
The kidnappers know that.
As I was saying ...

148
00:19:16,498 --> 00:19:20,099
Mrs. Hannon was seen
last at 3 pm.

149
00:19:20,498 --> 00:19:25,200
Is the time coming out with the dog.
Mr. Hannon arrived home at 7am ...

150
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:29,900
and surprised the woman was not there.
He thought he was still with the dog.

151
00:19:30,296 --> 00:19:33,998
An hour and a half later
Porter league ...

152
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,700
that you have reached
a videotape.

153
00:19:37,099 --> 00:19:40,200
The guy who delivered
was between 20 and 25 years ...

154
00:19:40,296 --> 00:19:43,498
was white
and had brown hair.

155
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,599
This is Mrs. Hannon.

156
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,500
Help me, Clark.

157
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,200
They want money,
and I said they could ...

158
00:19:54,498 --> 00:19:58,190
without having to do all this.
I do not want to hear.

159
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,498
No! Do not!

160
00:20:01,998 --> 00:20:05,900
What will they do
is to bury me, inside.

161
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:11,099
And only if you tell them where I am
der $ 1 million in cash.

162
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,400
If you call the police ...

163
00:20:13,998 --> 00:20:17,599
never tell where I was buried
or anything else.

164
00:20:21,099 --> 00:20:22,200
No, no, please.

165
00:20:26,998 --> 00:20:30,200
They want U.S. $ l million
cash ...

166
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:36,700
up at 6 am.
Take to the cemetery in Queens ...

167
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,900
the grave of Harry Houdini.

168
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,200
If you take the money
and not call the police ...

169
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,498
where I'm going to say
and you can save me.

170
00:20:46,998 --> 00:20:49,700
You must do this,
I promised them.

171
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:53,900
Do that and not spoil it!
Do not spoil everything ...

172
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,700
and do not call the police!
- How often do I see it?

173
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,998
You can stay outside, but is
important to be present.

174
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,299
Do not want to die.

175
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:13,796
Do not want to die.

176
00:21:19,296 --> 00:21:20,900
Do not want to die, Clark.

177
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:27,700
I'm afraid.

178
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,200
Take the hammer
and nails, Handsome.

179
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,900
No, do not!

180
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:50,400
No!

181
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,296
Get me outta here!

182
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,796
- She will die, will not you?
- No, it will not.

183
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:14,700
I called the police,
though it should not.

184
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,099
- Let's try to find it, really.
- How long does she have?

185
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,099
There should be a means
ventilation.

186
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:25,700
If not, she has 24 hours,
if not panic.

187
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:32,099
Do not panic? Are you crazy?
She was buried alive!

188
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,400
Can you tell me how
she's not going to panic?

189
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,400
I think that Ronald.

190
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:45,296
I do not care, it will solve.
I want the money at 5 am.

191
00:22:45,998 --> 00:22:48,998
I want a map of the cemetery,
the streets around ...

192
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,099
and buildings that can
use in the ambush.

193
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,498
Straightaway.

194
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,900
- Will you tell me where I was?
- In Judy.

195
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:04,099
I was shaken after chase
and could not find you.

196
00:23:04,796 --> 00:23:06,498
Did not look right.

197
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,200
- What we have right now?
- Not really.

198
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,296
- Are less than 2 hours from NY.
- That's right.

199
00:23:26,796 --> 00:23:29,700
The kidnapping happened at 3 am,
and the tape was delivered at 18:30.

200
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:33,100
- Buried in the meantime.
- What would it take two hours.

201
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:38,998
But they are in the middle of nowhere
they left the dog barking.

202
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,998
There are no prints on the tape.

203
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,099
The doorman did not recognize
the delivery man in our book.

204
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,200
Who gave was the Handsome.
Not the head.

205
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,200
- How do you know?
- The head is the face of the gun.

206
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,099
He gave all the orders and filmed
the other guy closing the coffin.

207
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,998
- It has power and does not want to work hard.
- Who goes to the cemetery?

208
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,700
- The head or Handsome?
- The head.

209
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,599
Handsome obeys orders,
but can not be trusted with money.

210
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,200
The head will not suspect
we are on the case?

211
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,900
- Who knows?
- Wonder where she lives ...

212
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,498
his name, he left with the
dog, the husband was not ...

213
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:21,200
and they have $ 1 million net.
We assume that in the case.

214
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,000
There is no option.
Now there is no return.

215
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,700
I want you two commanding
operation in the cemetery.

216
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,498
Canti, Peters,
you will stay in the area.

217
00:24:31,099 --> 00:24:35,099
I'm here to coordinate.
It is better, so do not lag behind.

218
00:24:36,296 --> 00:24:38,296
If he does not talk, can ...

219
00:24:43,099 --> 00:24:46,190
"There once was a man
who buried a shoe.

220
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:50,099
Who was the man
that buried the shoe?

221
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,400
I wanted to know.

222
00:24:58,099 --> 00:25:01,498
There once was a man
that a buried shellfish.

223
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:07,700
Who was the man who
buried a shellfish?

224
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,599
I wanted to know.

225
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,599
Once upon a time ...

226
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:30,700
a man who buried a boat.
Who was this man? "

227
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:35,200
"Let me out!
Let me out!

228
00:25:38,099 --> 00:25:39,296
Let me out!

229
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:44,998
Help, let me out!

230
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,000
Let me out!
Let me out! "

231
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,400
Guys, once again.
When it appears calm.

232
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,700
If he gets the information,
seize him when I have them.

233
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,500
If not, I do not want
know you are being followed.

234
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,099
Only Jesse and I go after him.

235
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,000
Jesse reply.

236
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,796
What?

237
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:08,296
I knew my father
was buried here?

238
00:27:10,498 --> 00:27:12,498
Really? No kidding!

239
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,700
I'm not kidding.
In these tombs flights.

240
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:23,796
If it was not kidnapping, we could
take up some flowers and pray.

241
00:27:25,296 --> 00:27:28,498
If not for the kidnapping,
I would not be here.

242
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,099
My dad just saw me
when I was perfect.

243
00:27:32,296 --> 00:27:33,700
And who is perfect?

244
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,498
Well ...

245
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,200
You're doing great.
I bet he'd be proud.

246
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,900
You did not know him ...
- Maddy ...

247
00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:52,400
I hate to interrupt, but stay
ready. I'm seeing someone.

248
00:27:58,296 --> 00:28:02,099
Who is checking the card?
- You got me.

249
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,900
Very good.
Only when I have acted.

250
00:28:52,498 --> 00:28:55,700
- Where does it go?
- Dunno.

251
00:28:56,498 --> 00:28:58,099
I think the scare.

252
00:29:02,498 --> 00:29:04,400
Madeline, he did return.

253
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:07,500
It's coming back?

254
00:29:22,796 --> 00:29:24,579
The head out of the car

255
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:26,400
Is walking.

256
00:29:48,099 --> 00:29:49,500
He called the cops?

257
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,900
If called, it dies.

258
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,998
- I did not call.
- I think the police are here.

259
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:05,099
Are you mike? I will not
frisk you, trust you.

260
00:30:06,498 --> 00:30:08,099
I know you love your wife.

261
00:30:09,796 --> 00:30:10,796
Here we are.

262
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,998
- The money is there?
- It only takes to say where she is.

263
00:30:16,796 --> 00:30:17,998
Are you threatening me?

264
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,296
Will give me orders now?

265
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,099
Stay tuned, folks.

266
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:27,200
Just want to know where she is.

267
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:34,200
- Spend the money, Clark.
- Where is she?

268
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,200
- In the woods.
- I know that. But where?

269
00:30:37,498 --> 00:30:39,700
- In the backyard.
- Where?

270
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:44,700
Are you losing your temper, Clark.

271
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:48,400
I thought it was money
staying calm.

272
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,599
All those millionaires auctions
and even breaking a sweat.

273
00:30:53,998 --> 00:30:57,150
Your money is here.
I made your game.

274
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,650
Take the money and go away,
but tell me where she is.

275
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:04,099
- I want her back.
- "I want her back."

276
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,900
Spend the money
and I say where she is!.

277
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,200
I kept my word,
will keep his?

278
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,099
I am a man of his word.

279
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:17,700
I'll tell you where to bury her.
But you must give me the money.

280
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,099
There goes the money.

281
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,498
If it passes the information
await my orders.

282
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,799
Caramba!

283
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,296
- Where is she?
- It's a beautiful woman! So cute!

284
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,998
- I loved her panties!
- Where is she?

285
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,900
- Why has sex with his secretary?
- You hear me? Tell me!

286
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,200
If you tell now, I'm screwed.

287
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,998
- Say it, please!
- Relax! Go play tennis!

288
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,296
- I'll call you in an hour.
- We had an agreement.

289
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,200
I handed over the money,
and you say where she is.

290
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:12,799
Bastard!

291
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,700
You bastard!

292
00:32:21,099 --> 00:32:22,099
Son of a bitch!

293
00:32:27,099 --> 00:32:28,796
Jesse, I'm behind you.

294
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:56,400
- Identified the card?
- It was stolen in Forest Hills.

295
00:32:56,998 --> 00:32:59,700
There are no witnesses
or fingerprints.

296
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:15,699
Maddy?

297
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,500
He is entering the city.

298
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,500
Damn!

299
00:36:11,699 --> 00:36:12,699
Want to play?

300
00:36:16,898 --> 00:36:17,797
Damn!

301
00:36:22,699 --> 00:36:26,199
I think I was identified.
I need reinforcements now.

302
00:37:30,797 --> 00:37:32,000
Crazy cow!

303
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,800
Excuse me!
He dropped something.

304
00:39:42,699 --> 00:39:45,199
For God's sake,
how long it takes!

305
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,500
My wife is dying
and it does not open its beak.

306
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:48,699
Any results?

307
00:39:49,699 --> 00:39:54,199
This is a joke. We call
The FBI immediately.

308
00:39:54,699 --> 00:39:59,800
- I can not stand his silence!
- It is not the case for the FBI.

309
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,398
- This is not an interstate case.
- Do not give a damn about it!

310
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,898
You know who I am?

311
00:40:07,849 --> 00:40:11,199
I will denounce you,
their incompetent!

312
00:40:13,898 --> 00:40:17,000
- He is not very optimistic.
- We can not blame him.

313
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,800
- He said nothing?
- Not at all.

314
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:23,099
Jerome Jersey is inside,
trying to fold it.

315
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:26,000
He only asked for a pack of cigarettes ...

316
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:28,898
and nothing else.
Time is running out.

317
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:32,699
Send Clark Hannon enter and finish
to race him until he speaks.

318
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:37,099
- I like the idea.
- It's the best so far.

319
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:39,699
Listen ...

320
00:40:40,898 --> 00:40:43,500
... My wife is well?
- She's great.

321
00:40:43,898 --> 00:40:45,898
- I tried to talk to the hospital ...
- It is only a little silly ...

322
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:48,199
and probably very angry.

323
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:52,898
They found his fingerprint
and Handsome?

324
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:55,797
We're checking the Handsome,
but this one ...

325
00:40:56,199 --> 00:41:00,199
Must have passed the acid in the fingers.
He does not want his identity revealed.

326
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:03,699
Well, we need
find out his name.

327
00:41:11,699 --> 00:41:14,898
You can not negotiate
if one side does not speak.

328
00:41:15,099 --> 00:41:18,000
So you will not do.
We should be moving or it dies.

329
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:22,199
- I'll wait a little longer.
- You know what?

330
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:28,300
I'm ready to talk.
I'll open the beak.

331
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:31,699
- I'm getting.
- But not with the Polish!

332
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:34,797
And even with no
these incompetent!

333
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:38,000
I will only talk to one person.

334
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:43,500
Bring the cow that
ruined my plans!

335
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:48,898
- You can talk to someone else?
- We tried for half an hour.

336
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,099
- He will only talk to you.
- I can not do that.

337
00:41:53,297 --> 00:41:57,000
- We have no choice, sorry.
- This is the life of a woman.

338
00:41:57,297 --> 00:42:00,099
It'll be fine.
You're a good cop.

339
00:42:01,398 --> 00:42:03,898
- I have faith in you.
- You?

340
00:42:04,699 --> 00:42:06,000
I've always had.

341
00:42:10,099 --> 00:42:11,000
It is ...

342
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:15,699
- Always have.
- But you never believed.

343
00:42:36,898 --> 00:42:38,699
We need to talk, right?

344
00:42:44,699 --> 00:42:48,898
And let's talk after bringing
Frances Hannon back alive.

345
00:43:26,699 --> 00:43:27,699
Good luck.

346
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,699
I was waiting.

347
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,099
I knew.

348
00:43:51,797 --> 00:43:55,898
- Mario Andretti ...
- In the flesh.

349
00:44:00,797 --> 00:44:04,699
Very good. Why was the
chosen to talk to you?

350
00:44:06,797 --> 00:44:10,000
Want me to shut up again?

351
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:14,099
- It was not what I said.
- So do not worry.

352
00:44:16,898 --> 00:44:20,699
I chose you because it was
who spoiled my plans.

353
00:44:22,297 --> 00:44:25,898
- Could have been a millionaire.
- It was not a perfect plan.

354
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,500
Clark knew that Hannon
call the police.

355
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:32,199
- Do not think it was stupid.
- Donkey?

356
00:44:33,898 --> 00:44:37,898
The guy's wife is buried
alive and know where she is.

357
00:44:38,199 --> 00:44:41,398
I told him to not call the police,
or I would not count.

358
00:44:43,099 --> 00:44:45,300
If he called it, is stupid.

359
00:44:46,099 --> 00:44:49,099
- He killed his own wife.
- Not yet.

360
00:44:50,699 --> 00:44:54,000
It's true.
The clock is ticking.

361
00:44:57,699 --> 00:45:02,199
You're a beauty, you know?
I mean, to a policeman.

362
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,099
What's your name
true, "Mario"?

363
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:08,699
Detective Foster.

364
00:45:10,398 --> 00:45:11,199
Name ...

365
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:17,950
Madeline.

366
00:45:19,398 --> 00:45:23,699
It's a beautiful name.
Beautiful name for a beautiful woman.

367
00:45:26,699 --> 00:45:28,099
And what is yours?

368
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,199
Harry. Want a cigarette?

369
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:44,699
- No smoking. Harry who?
- Do not smoke?

370
00:45:44,699 --> 00:45:45,699
Harry who?

371
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,797
Houdini.
Harry Houdini.

372
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:57,699
- You know Harry Houdini?
- Will talk about what matters?

373
00:45:58,199 --> 00:46:01,199
Time is running out,
you do not want her to die!

374
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:05,900
I do not want? Do not think
're assuming too much?

375
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:10,099
- Awareness of Harry Houdini.
- You or the other?

376
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,300
The other. I know not
know anything about me.

377
00:46:14,199 --> 00:46:16,297
It was a magical and he is dead.

378
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:25,000
It was an escape artist.
The greatest of all time.

379
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:29,800
In 1921 he was buried alive
a shirt-jacket. And he escaped.

380
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:35,300
He was 7 feet,
in a locked box ...

381
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,199
wearing a shirt-jacket,
and escaped.

382
00:46:40,099 --> 00:46:41,898
He was too good.

383
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:45,000
What a pity!
Frances is not as smart.

384
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:48,900
Too bad thing!
It's cool to be smart.

385
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,700
I'm smart.

386
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:59,800
Keep your hands up!
Do not move!

387
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,900
- Want to see your hands! Do not move!
- Easy! Okay, guys!

388
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,900
- I found a wire.
- I was just showing off.

389
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,099
- Are you okay?
- Yes. It's okay.

390
00:47:09,898 --> 00:47:14,300
Okay. I was just showing the
that she will never hold me.

391
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,699
Unleash it.

392
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:21,900
It's okay, guys.
Unhook it and leave. Thank you.

393
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
This guy has accumulated anger.
I can not talk that way.

394
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:32,190
Enough already.

395
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:34,199
Captain ...

396
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:39,100
Enough already. Everything is under control,
and want to continue the conversation.

397
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:41,898
Tim!
Get out!

398
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,500
- Thanks.
- I appreciate that.

399
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:00,800
Shut up!

400
00:48:14,199 --> 00:48:17,500
- It was exciting.
- If you repeat, I'll kill you.

401
00:48:18,199 --> 00:48:19,199
Okay.

402
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,898
Beautiful alliance.
How long have you been married?

403
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:32,900
As there will be more trapped?
Ever been in jail?

404
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,600
Why your husband
burned his arm?

405
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,898
As there will be more trapped?
Ever been in jail?

406
00:48:42,199 --> 00:48:45,199
Answer my question,
and respond to her.

407
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:51,000
Her husband burned you with
cigarette because it was evil?

408
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,300
What is it, Madeline?

409
00:49:04,159 --> 00:49:05,500
He's watching?

410
00:49:09,398 --> 00:49:10,398
It's a cop?

411
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:19,700
Close the window.
We need privacy.

412
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,200
- Will remain open.
- I do not like snoopers.

413
00:49:24,199 --> 00:49:28,000
- You'll feel more comfortable.
- No way, they must observe.

414
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:32,699
- I will not hurt. Just ...
- The window will stay open!

415
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,100
"Get me out of this, the coffin,
please!

416
00:49:38,297 --> 00:49:42,000
- It's so dark! "
- My goodness, that excites you?

417
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:45,300
- You are pissing me off for real!
- Nice to know that chafes.

418
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,500
But at what point?

419
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,500
- Do you like blood?
- Go to hell!

420
00:49:51,699 --> 00:49:55,000
- I will.
- She will die, will help or not?

421
00:49:55,699 --> 00:49:57,500
I think I've helped.

422
00:49:58,599 --> 00:50:01,500
- Tell me something.
- What?

423
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:06,099
Want to talk about the burns
front of her husband strip or not?

424
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:19,599
- She is losing control.
- I know.

425
00:50:24,199 --> 00:50:26,199
The time of amateurism over.

426
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,699
It was easy, you know?

427
00:50:40,699 --> 00:50:41,898
Very easy.

428
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,000
Kidnap her?

429
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,500
Imagine kidnapping her.

430
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,898
I used to think
about it in bed.

431
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:00,900
Sleep was impossible.

432
00:51:02,699 --> 00:51:05,000
It was not so easy,
you got caught.

433
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:07,898
Really?

434
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,898
Did not I think
about it too?

435
00:51:14,599 --> 00:51:16,898
- I do not know.
- Of course you do.

436
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:23,200
I think you know very well what
is to surrender to the fantasies.

437
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,199
- Madeline, to talk to you.
- Not now, Tim

438
00:51:29,297 --> 00:51:32,398
"Not now, Tim
We are making progress. "

439
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,500
Hello, Mr. Madeline.

440
00:51:38,699 --> 00:51:41,199
You are jealous of
Smoking mysterious?

441
00:51:43,398 --> 00:51:45,600
Come, Madeline. Now!

442
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:50,199
Goodbye.

443
00:51:55,398 --> 00:51:58,199
- The FBI will take over.
- Are they here?

444
00:51:59,398 --> 00:52:02,720
Clark Hannon pulled strings.
The case is theirs now.

445
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:05,900
Go downstairs
and pass the report.

446
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:12,900
Tim ...

447
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,500
What happened to Madeline?

448
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,300
Where is the beautiful Madeline?

449
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,000
The party's over?

450
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,000
Time to get serious?

451
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,700
I have not voted in the governor.

452
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:24,300
I'm not from NY, came to service.
And if it did, would vote at the opponent.

453
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:30,000
He scares me. It is a weak
who acts as if he knew everything.

454
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:34,900
He knows nothing, thinks only he knows.
Have you seen the suits him?

455
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
I'm not crazy about fashion,
as you can see ...

456
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:43,800
but if I were governor,
I would only use hand-made suits.

457
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:49,000
The guy is all powerful and not
know how to use a tie. Asshole!

458
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:54,500
I'm talking about him because
even being so weak ...

459
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:58,000
he is a pawn to
some conservatives.

460
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,500
This governor has plenty of power.

461
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:05,900
He reinstated the death penalty
NY. Now they can kill people.

462
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:11,900
They say that lethal injection
is not so cruel.

463
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:14,200
Have you heard?

464
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:19,300
It is horrifying.
A bullet would be less cruel.

465
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:23,900
But think otherwise.
Sages always think otherwise.

466
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,800
The idea of sleeping
and never wake up ...

467
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:32,100
is so appalling that
makes my heart ache.

468
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:36,500
Imagine falling asleep slowly,
be stoned for this ...

469
00:54:37,199 --> 00:54:41,700
Dreaming with family and friends.
Whether you dream of good things ...

470
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:45,900
but can not,
because he knows he will not wake up.

471
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:49,500
It starts fighting
against sleep ...

472
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:54,500
and to think of himself,
No cause of death ...

473
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,800
the person who killed him.

474
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:02,100
Soon the dreams will stop
everything will be darkness ...

475
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:05,300
no light, just death.

476
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:09,700
Nothing more.
Begins to fight the sleep ...

477
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:13,600
You need to wake up
and stop these people.

478
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:18,000
"Stop, please!
Can not sleep!

479
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:22,000
They can not make me sleep and dream
with these horrible things. "

480
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:25,500
Only one problem,
a nightmare.

481
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:30,900
So clear, cold and perfect
as the very evil personified.

482
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,500
Can not wake up ...

483
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:36,700
no matter how hard you try.
Can not.

484
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:41,500
Then you die so
in the most horrible torture.

485
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:46,300
That's what this governor weak
calls "not cruel".

486
00:55:51,199 --> 00:55:54,500
It's what they do with
murderers in this state.

487
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:03,700
- But that monologue beast!
- Where buried, Harry?

488
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:08,500
- Where is he buried?
- Time to negotiate?

489
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:12,800
- No more monologues beasts?
- Enough.

490
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:14,900
Very good.

491
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:20,300
Can you bring me a sandwich
meat and a Coke?

492
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,900
I'll tell you
you need to know.

493
00:56:26,199 --> 00:56:29,500
Let's play "let's make
agreement. "You're Monty Hall.

494
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:34,700
Pego and 20 years probation after
10 years for good behavior.

495
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:40,300
Promise me
and tell you where it is.

496
00:56:45,199 --> 00:56:48,199
Toward Poughkeepsie
near Highway 9.

497
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:51,200
I want three teams waiting
when you get there.

498
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:54,600
I also want to paddle
and goat-feet, understood?

499
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:59,900
And doctors, too. She'll need
care once it is saved.

500
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,900
I want everything ready!
I want this woman alive!

501
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:07,900
I had never been
helicopter!

502
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:27,000
Do not do it.

503
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,900
- Do not drink!
- No stuffing, Tim

504
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:38,300
Damn! We promise that
we would not drink any more.

505
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:42,900
What do you do?
Want to throw it all away?

506
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:44,500
Check This Out!

507
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:49,900
His arm is all burnt!
What are you doing?

508
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,700
- There goes his perfect wife.
- I never asked that.

509
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,300
I cheated on you.

510
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:05,700
And drank hidden.

511
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,300
You do not know me.

512
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:16,000
Still love me?

513
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:20,900
Lie!

514
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:25,700
Madeline!
I'm sorry.

515
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:30,700
Do not follow me.
Please, I ...

516
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:33,700
Not worth the sacrifice.

517
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,500
Just a little bit.

518
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:54,300
A little more ...

519
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:04,000
I was looking for you.
Okay?

520
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,700
You did very well.
Do not think I messed up.

521
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:09,300
Do not worry.
I thank you, but ...

522
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,500
Just wanted to say could
impressions of Handsome.

523
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:20,300
- The party is no longer ours, remember?
- Not interested?

524
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:26,500
What gave?

525
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,300
The name is Greg Evans.
Thief second.

526
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:33,500
Booked into Miami and San Francisco
for prostitution, drugs and theft.

527
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:35,700
A nobody.

528
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:39,700
- Do you think they will find Sra.Hannon?
- I do not know.

529
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:44,300
Why Harry told the FBI?
If she dies, he gets life imprisonment.

530
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:48,300
The show gets better
if the feds get into.

531
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:52,300
- I do not think he's acting.
- Foster?

532
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:55,400
Madeline Foster?
Mollino, FBI.

533
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:59,300
- The psycho was something with her.
- Mine?

534
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,900
When entering the helicopter,
asked to give you this.

535
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:05,500
Sent thank the loan.

536
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:09,300
It is not so honest
managed to steal matches.

537
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:15,100
- Strange.
- Very strange.

538
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:19,500
Not lent any match.

539
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,500
ROOM 10

540
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:34,700
A guy came in here all day,
exactly at 13 h.

541
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:41,100
I think I was a teacher. Vineyard
every day, sitting right there ...

542
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:45,000
asked for a drink, took
denture, put on the counter ...

543
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:48,900
and drink till you drop.
Then he died.

544
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,500
- Nice story, Sally.
- Really.

545
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:11,300
The machine! We can find the name
Harry through the device.

546
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,100
- What are you talking about?
- Listen ...

547
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:18,700
We can not take fingerprints,
but he uses the device.

548
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:22,300
- You must go to a dentist.
- The barber, too, but so what?

549
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:26,000
It is a ridiculous shot,
but it must have been about 25 years.

550
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:29,000
How many guys in this
age wear braces?

551
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:32,800
We sent a picture of him at all
dentists in the city ...

552
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:36,900
by fax, email or by hand.
Someone will identify it.

553
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
All dentists in NY?

554
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:44,700
- You gone crazy?
- Does anyone have a better idea?

555
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:36,300
Does anyone have repellent?
They are eating me alive.

556
01:02:44,199 --> 01:02:46,699
- Kids!
- Come on!

557
01:03:03,199 --> 01:03:04,199
I found it!

558
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,700
I'm listening to something.

559
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:36,450
Damn!

560
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:39,900
- They are holding?
- 1,2,3 ...

561
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,297
How it got there?

562
01:04:29,297 --> 01:04:31,000
It is not my patient.

563
01:04:32,297 --> 01:04:34,000
It is not my patient.

564
01:04:35,297 --> 01:04:38,000
Sorry, never seen this guy.

565
01:04:38,297 --> 01:04:39,398
Yes, sir.

566
01:04:42,297 --> 01:04:45,099
Okay.
Right now.

567
01:04:45,297 --> 01:04:47,199
- They found her?
- Do you know who was buried?

568
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:49,500
- Who?
- The dog of Frances.

569
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:53,500
Harry turns around and says, "They wanted to know
where she was buried, no?

570
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:56,297
There is a 'she'. "
It was a bitch.

571
01:04:57,700 --> 01:04:59,000
Damn!

572
01:05:02,898 --> 01:05:04,000
What?

573
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:07,199
- Do you know why he sent us here?
- Why?

574
01:05:07,297 --> 01:05:09,898
To show she is a murderer.

575
01:05:10,297 --> 01:05:13,898
We can not say: "Tell me where
it is before I die ...

576
01:05:14,297 --> 01:05:17,199
and not be accused. "
He changed the rules.

577
01:05:19,797 --> 01:05:23,500
It's all a game to him.
The Feds are screwed.

578
01:05:23,898 --> 01:05:25,898
- There are not.
- How so?

579
01:05:26,398 --> 01:05:29,099
- You are you.
- Me?

580
01:05:29,398 --> 01:05:34,297
They talked with Harry, and he said
Frances Hannon see only alive ...

581
01:05:34,318 --> 01:05:37,500
if he talk to you alone.

582
01:05:39,297 --> 01:05:40,898
The party is yours.

583
01:06:32,599 --> 01:06:34,099
Planned it, right?

584
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,500
- Hi to you too.
- Answer!

585
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,699
- I did not plan to get caught.
- Really?

586
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:45,500
Then he took the trouble to create
these bad jokes for nothing?

587
01:06:46,297 --> 01:06:47,699
- Do not see the dog engradaçada?
- No. ..

588
01:06:47,898 --> 01:06:51,699
... I did not find anything funny.
- I thought it was hilarious!

589
01:06:51,849 --> 01:06:55,099
Nor were we funny
we find her boyfriend dead.

590
01:06:55,699 --> 01:06:58,398
There is no agreement with you.
Go get the death penalty, right?

591
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:01,000
Stop playing strip.

592
01:07:01,398 --> 01:07:04,398
If I wanted it,
would have made fools of the FBI ...

593
01:07:04,418 --> 01:07:07,099
dig every inch
Westchester County.

594
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,398
And just for his government ...

595
01:07:11,797 --> 01:07:15,898
Handsome was not my boyfriend.
I'm not an idiot deer.

596
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:20,500
Needed someone to dig,
who could have got ready.

597
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:25,898
- I want to be clear.
- Killer, all right, but not gay!

598
01:07:26,599 --> 01:07:31,099
That's it. We can make a
demonstration right here at the table.

599
01:07:32,599 --> 01:07:36,599
- I brought cigarettes
- Fuck you!

600
01:07:37,099 --> 01:07:40,699
You are uptight!
Will getting my period?

601
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:45,699
Your husband can get you
borrow a towel.

602
01:07:46,297 --> 01:07:47,500
Make yourself at home.

603
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,297
We both felt
pleasure with pain.

604
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:55,599
I'm not like you.

605
01:07:56,797 --> 01:08:01,000
Really?
I think it's just like me.

606
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:26,099
In one hour, Frances will
running out of oxygen.

607
01:08:26,398 --> 01:08:29,599
So, we'll stop
to talk to you ...

608
01:08:29,698 --> 01:08:33,898
you stop having fun and will
the rest of your miserable life ...

609
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,500
a cell of 3 m by 5 m.
Is this what you want?

610
01:08:39,898 --> 01:08:43,198
That does not scare me.
I've been to prison.

611
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:49,698
Like you said, it will be charged
murder. Do not want deal.

612
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:55,698
By the way, from which he
one hour of oxygen?

613
01:08:56,898 --> 01:09:00,500
Frances would be surprised if
still alive.

614
01:09:17,698 --> 01:09:19,500
He said he dreamed about doing this.

615
01:09:20,099 --> 01:09:25,099
- Eat a teacher too.
- Why? By chance is a game?

616
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:28,800
- Want to get revenge on the police?
- You're smart.

617
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,000
- Close the window and tell you everything.
- Have you ever been arrested, right?

618
01:09:32,198 --> 01:09:36,198
- Must be willing to take revenge.
- Became a student of psychology?

619
01:09:37,398 --> 01:09:39,599
Close the window and tell you everything.

620
01:09:39,599 --> 01:09:42,300
- Go tell her where he buried?
- I will tell all!

621
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:46,398
But close the window, turn
the microphone and get rid of the cops.

622
01:09:47,698 --> 01:09:48,898
I want privacy.

623
01:09:51,398 --> 01:09:54,198
If you do not,
I do not open the beak.

624
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,898
It will be so for years and years.

625
01:09:58,698 --> 01:10:02,698
Mr. Hannon will
dreaming of worms ...

626
01:10:02,898 --> 01:10:05,300
eating the body
nude of his wife.

627
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:10,898
I know him.

628
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:15,300
- It's my patient.
- Are you sure?

629
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:17,500
I look like a liar?

630
01:10:17,698 --> 01:10:20,898
- I said, I know!
- Has the name or address?

631
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:24,898
No. Do not register my patients.

632
01:10:25,698 --> 01:10:27,898
Neither use anesthesia in surgery.

633
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:31,099
Absolutely!
I have everything!

634
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,500
No need to do this.

635
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,500
- Accurate, yes.
- Need? Why?

636
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,698
- When I look in his eyes ...
- What is it?

637
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:11,398
- What happens?
- Foster ...

638
01:11:11,898 --> 01:11:14,500
if you need
anything, yell.

639
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:18,198
Three armed men ready
to enter that room.

640
01:11:18,698 --> 01:11:21,800
- I will not need.
- He has nothing to lose.

641
01:11:21,898 --> 01:11:24,198
It means that everything is possible.

642
01:11:25,898 --> 01:11:28,198
- I get it.
- The helicopters are stationed.

643
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,500
If he speaks, we're ready.

644
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:33,599
- How long do I have?
- Look at it this way ...

645
01:11:33,698 --> 01:11:38,300
anyone would agree with him.
She is already dead.

646
01:11:40,898 --> 01:11:42,698
20 minutes at most.

647
01:13:15,898 --> 01:13:17,198
And then?

648
01:13:22,198 --> 01:13:26,198
Frances is so close that
can find her alive.

649
01:13:27,898 --> 01:13:30,099
I'll tell you at the right time.

650
01:13:34,698 --> 01:13:36,198
Okay.

651
01:13:37,898 --> 01:13:40,300
- Tell me.
- You already know.

652
01:13:41,898 --> 01:13:43,198
No, I do not know.

653
01:13:44,898 --> 01:13:47,898
- You know, yes.
- I do not know, must tell me.

654
01:13:49,099 --> 01:13:51,698
- First, let's talk.
- For what?

655
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:56,500
I was lucky to find you
and like you.

656
01:13:57,198 --> 01:14:01,700
He planned everything and do not see why
stop now. What do you want?

657
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:07,100
I intend to hold these
chains and run away.

658
01:14:09,898 --> 01:14:11,898
I plan to stay with that famous

659
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:16,599
This miracle will happen before or
after telling where he buried?

660
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:21,500
She is in the backyard.
He said this at the cemetery.

661
01:14:22,698 --> 01:14:24,000
But where?

662
01:14:27,698 --> 01:14:30,500
- Where?
- You already know.

663
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,500
Just need to think.

664
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:51,398
Come on!

665
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:54,198
I cover, you go!
C'mon!

666
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:55,099
Come on, guys!

667
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,300
What type of girl are you?

668
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:10,398
- She was nice or nasty?
- Tell me now where she is!

669
01:15:11,099 --> 01:15:13,500
Conflicts to decide?

670
01:15:15,099 --> 01:15:17,898
Want to be good because
everyone expects it?

671
01:15:18,099 --> 01:15:21,099
Or evil, because
is what is real?

672
01:15:21,898 --> 01:15:25,099
We can not talk.
We have no time.

673
01:15:25,099 --> 01:15:28,198
When I saw the burns,
know that we are equal.

674
01:15:28,599 --> 01:15:30,300
I'm not like you.

675
01:15:31,099 --> 01:15:34,599
These marks do not mean
that are similar.

676
01:15:37,099 --> 01:15:40,000
Know that we are equal.
So again.

677
01:15:40,099 --> 01:15:44,898
You can learn from me.
We like to feel pain ...

678
01:15:45,099 --> 01:15:48,099
... and sadness.
- Not the same thing.

679
01:15:49,099 --> 01:15:51,599
Do not see a little
me in you?

680
01:15:52,898 --> 01:15:56,198
It may not be the same level,
but exceeded the limits.

681
01:15:59,198 --> 01:16:02,198
Not the same thing.
- I do not agree.

682
01:16:09,198 --> 01:16:11,198
You think you understand me?

683
01:16:12,698 --> 01:16:17,099
What is your theory of student
psychology? Maltreated?

684
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:21,698
My father handcuffed
and raped? Nonsense!

685
01:16:22,698 --> 01:16:24,898
I'm just like everyone else!

686
01:16:28,398 --> 01:16:32,898
Some women have
the fantasy of being raped.

687
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:40,198
But do not want
happen for real.

688
01:16:40,698 --> 01:16:42,898
But you, Madeline ...

689
01:16:43,198 --> 01:16:45,198
eventually succumbed to their fantasies.

690
01:16:47,198 --> 01:16:50,698
Me too.
You did what you should not.

691
01:16:53,898 --> 01:16:55,198
Why?

692
01:16:56,898 --> 01:16:58,898
Why, Madeline?

693
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,500
Get me out ...

694
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,898
Get me out!

695
01:17:26,099 --> 01:17:27,300
Captain!

696
01:17:28,898 --> 01:17:31,099
I think you should see this.

697
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:38,800
Which side will you choose?

698
01:17:40,398 --> 01:17:43,198
What makes you feel
sad and useless ...

699
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:47,198
or what makes you feel
so sad and useless, which is good?

700
01:17:50,198 --> 01:17:54,198
What your friend "butt"
has what you need and search?

701
01:17:56,198 --> 01:17:57,698
Tell me what it is.

702
01:17:59,198 --> 01:18:02,198
Tell me where you go,
and everything will be clear.

703
01:18:04,198 --> 01:18:05,198
Say.

704
01:18:09,198 --> 01:18:10,500
Tell me.

705
01:18:15,898 --> 01:18:18,500
Tell me! C'mon!

706
01:18:26,198 --> 01:18:29,198
It is the only place
where I feel free.

707
01:18:30,198 --> 01:18:31,300
Me too.

708
01:18:34,198 --> 01:18:35,898
Not scary?

709
01:18:37,198 --> 01:18:40,099
- Doesn 't panic?
- Yes.

710
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:42,500
And can not tell anyone.

711
01:18:43,198 --> 01:18:46,198
- Your husband will never understand.
- Not true.

712
01:18:47,198 --> 01:18:51,500
I never dared tell him.
You hate that side.

713
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:56,198
You know, he'll never
would love to know.

714
01:18:57,198 --> 01:19:00,300
- Not true.
- See?

715
01:19:01,698 --> 01:19:03,698
Still, conflicts, Madeline.

716
01:19:06,398 --> 01:19:09,898
I've already won.
Always feel free.

717
01:19:13,698 --> 01:19:14,800
Think like me.

718
01:19:18,398 --> 01:19:22,198
Will you tell me where he buried
Frances Hannon?

719
01:19:25,698 --> 01:19:26,698
Think!

720
01:19:28,698 --> 01:19:29,898
Think like me.

721
01:19:32,698 --> 01:19:33,898
Think like you.

722
01:19:43,698 --> 01:19:47,000
- Come on! I know you can.
- He wanted to play because it's good.

723
01:19:49,198 --> 01:19:51,898
It's good because it is wrong.

724
01:19:55,198 --> 01:19:59,898
- You know it's good to do something wrong.
- Are you doing your little game.

725
01:20:01,198 --> 01:20:03,599
It's so good that
got to stop.

726
01:20:04,198 --> 01:20:07,500
Because the little game
down was wrong.

727
01:20:09,198 --> 01:20:13,198
So wrong that every little
detail you excited ...

728
01:20:15,898 --> 01:20:17,198
you let on.

729
01:20:22,698 --> 01:20:24,300
Details excite you?

730
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,099
Plan ...

731
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,698
Planning is the best part
is not it? That's it.

732
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:38,698
- That's all.
- Plan everything.

733
01:20:39,198 --> 01:20:40,198
Everything.

734
01:20:41,198 --> 01:20:43,198
Just to get here.

735
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:52,198
I planned it.

736
01:20:53,398 --> 01:20:56,698
Until coming to the police station
Poughkeepsie.

737
01:20:58,698 --> 01:21:02,698
Yeah, Madeline.
The yard is behind this building.

738
01:21:04,198 --> 01:21:05,698
FRESH INK

739
01:21:21,198 --> 01:21:22,898
There, sir.

740
01:21:38,198 --> 01:21:40,000
POLICE IN POUGHKEEPSIE

741
01:21:40,198 --> 01:21:41,898
Good heavens!

742
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
- Phil Kline.
- Where's Madeline?

743
01:21:47,198 --> 01:21:49,000
- Are you Houdini.
- Alone?

744
01:21:49,198 --> 01:21:42,099
- Yes, but ...
- Hey, it was all a plan!

745
01:21:52,198 --> 01:21:55,099
He planned to stay
alone with a cop!

746
01:21:55,198 --> 01:21:58,198
- What are you talking about?
- Get there now!

747
01:22:06,198 --> 01:22:07,198
Damn!

748
01:22:26,698 --> 01:22:29,198
See the beauty of it all.

749
01:22:29,698 --> 01:22:33,398
I wanted to be rich or be
superfamoso a kidnapper.

750
01:22:33,698 --> 01:22:36,398
Ever wondered what the
newspapers say?

751
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:39,398
Within a week, call the police.

752
01:22:39,698 --> 01:22:43,698
I say we will find the body of
Frances and a young strip ...

753
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:47,698
buried together.
And I am free forever.

754
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:54,500
In hindsight, I am a great
escape artist, is not it?

755
01:22:55,698 --> 01:22:57,000
Must admit.

756
01:22:59,698 --> 01:23:01,698
I'm even better than Houdini.

757
01:23:17,698 --> 01:23:19,698
Do not you dare move.

758
01:23:21,698 --> 01:23:23,698
Okay, time for fun.

759
01:23:26,698 --> 01:23:27,800
Come here!

760
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:30,800
Stay there.

761
01:23:41,698 --> 01:23:44,898
Come on. Time to
join the "Sra.Caixote.

762
01:23:49,698 --> 01:23:51,698
Is it still alive?

763
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:01,000
That uncomfortable having to share
space with a corpse, is not it?

764
01:24:04,898 --> 01:24:07,000
Ready for your worst nightmare?

765
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:24,198
She was so beautiful.

766
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,300
There seems to be at peace?

767
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:46,500
Do not even think about leaving here!

768
01:24:50,698 --> 01:24:53,398
- What will you do?
- I do not know.

769
01:24:56,198 --> 01:25:00,099
I'm torn between throwing
or bury you alive.

770
01:25:01,198 --> 01:25:03,898
It will not do either.

771
01:25:07,198 --> 01:25:11,500
Frances, what do you think?
Shoot or burial alive?

772
01:25:21,698 --> 01:25:23,500
Bury this bastard!

773
01:25:28,198 --> 01:25:30,099
You heard what she said.

774
01:25:33,198 --> 01:25:36,500
Bury me, Madeline!
Go ahead!

775
01:25:38,198 --> 01:25:39,698
I love it!

776
01:25:40,198 --> 01:25:41,500
Bury me!

777
01:25:44,698 --> 01:25:48,000
I want more, baby!
More! Bury me!

778
01:25:48,198 --> 01:25:49,500
C'mon!

779
01:25:53,198 --> 01:25:54,898
Let me, bury me!

780
01:25:55,198 --> 01:25:58,000
Bury me, I'm here!
Bury me!

781
01:26:00,198 --> 01:25:02,099
More! Plus, c'mon!

782
01:26:04,198 --> 01:26:05,198
More!

783
01:26:06,198 --> 01:26:07,898
Bury me!

784
01:26:09,198 --> 01:26:11,500
Bury me, baby!

785
01:26:27,198 --> 01:26:30,099
Madeline ... Madeline ...

786
01:26:33,198 --> 01:26:34,198
What?

787
01:26:36,198 --> 01:26:38,698
Now you're free.

788
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:58,099
The wife of millionaire
was found still alive ...

789
01:27:58,198 --> 01:28:02,099
after spending 24 hours buried.
As for the kidnapper ...

790
01:28:02,198 --> 01:28:06,500
Police still keeps secret
about the circumstances ...
