00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:29,708
             LARRY WAS RAISED
             AT A PIG FARM.

148
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:31,543
             AND AT AGE 13

149
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:34,279
      HE WAS PUT IN CHARGE
    OF INSEMINATING THE PIGS.

150
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:36,948
            AT AGE 15

151
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,651
 HE LEARNED THERE WAS A MACHINE
    THAT COULD DO IT FOR HIM.

152
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:45,323
     A MERE 30 YEARS LATER,
LARRY WAS THE BREAKOUT STAR

    LARRY YELLS "GIT-R-DONE"

158
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,337
        AND HIS AUDIENCE
        COMES A-RUNNIN'.

159
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:01,840
    GIT-R-DONE IS TO REDNECKS

160
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,976
WHAT FREE CHICKEN AND WHITE
      BITCHES IS TO BLACKS.

    BUT COME ON, LARRY.
     HAVEN'T YOU MILKED THIS
  GIT-R-DONE THING LONG ENOUGH?

162
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,755
          YOU'VE BEATEN
      THAT CONCEPT SO HARD

163
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:19,024
         IT'S NOW DATING
          CHRIS BROWN.

172
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,161
    BEFORE GREG GIRALDO

176
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,678
         A WAY TO DO IT.

177
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:16,047

KEEP IT GOING FOR THAT GUY.

191
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,564
        WASN'T HE FUNNY?

192
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:08,633

00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,104
         I LOVE THE PINK
        CAMOUFLAGE, LISA.

195
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,340
        YOU'RE LIKE
         GENERAL FATTON.

196
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,509
         <i>HOLY SHIT.</i>
     <i>LOOK AT YOU, YOU FAT --.</i>

197
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:19,778
     WHO KNEW LANE BRYANT'S
          HAD AN ARMY?

198
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,848
     LISA ACTUALLY HAS A LOT
  IN COMMON WITH THAT OCTOMOM--

199
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,350
    THAT WOMAN WHO GAVE BIRTH
      TO ALL THOSE BABIES.

200
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:26,918
      SHE'S NEVER GIVEN BIRTH,

201
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,688
    BUT SHE HAS HAD 80 FINGERS
    INSIDE HER AT THE SAME TIME.

202
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,901
        LOOK AT THIS PACK
        OF SLOBS UP HERE.

203
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,536
    GARY BUSEY'S HERE,
            KIND OF.

204
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:47,338
         <i>HOW ABOUT GARY?</i>

205
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:49,641
              <i>YEAH.</i>

206
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,810
     GARY, I GUESS, FLEW IN
      FROM LOBOTOMY ISLAND.

207
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:55,146
          JESUS, GARY,
    YOU HORSE-FACED LUNATIC.

208
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,550
    YOU LOOK LIKE NICK NOLTE
        -- A CLYDESDALE.

209
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:03,288
      YOUR TEETH LOOK LIKE
        A ROW OF URINALS.
        LOOK AT YOURSELF.

210
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:06,391
    EVERY TIME YOU TALK
I WANNA PISS IN YOUR MOUTH.

211
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:10,328
     <i>AND I DON'T KNOW--</i>

212
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,765
      WARREN, WHAT THE HELL
    ARE YOU DOING HERE?

213
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,835
        HOLY SHIT.
    WARREN WAS GREAT ON
    "DANCING WITH THE STARS."

214
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,838
        HE CAME IN SECOND
    AND THEN CELEBRATED
     BY DRAGGING HIS PARTNER

215
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,906
          TO THE TOP OF
THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING.

216
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:23,608
        ( crowd groans )

217
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:26,010
        IT'S GREAT TO SEE
        TOBY KEITH.

218
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,946
    TOBY, I'M GLAD YOU
    COULD TAKE TIME OUT

219
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,115
        FROM SPITTING ON
      MEXICANS TO BE HERE.

220
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:33,284
          TOBY, YOU PUT
        THE BIG IN BIGOT.

221
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:35,587
     I LOVED YOUR LAST SONG,
     "GET OUT OF MY COUNTRY,

222
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:38,456
    YOU CAMEL JOCKEY WETBACK
         FAGGY -- JEW."

223
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:43,661
    AND MARSHA BRADY IS HERE.

224
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:45,563
     MAUREEN McCORMICK, HUH?
         HOW ABOUT THAT?

225
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:47,699
        HOLY SHIT,
          MARSHA BRADY.

226
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,969
YOU WROTE IN YOUR BOOK YOU
  USED TO TRADE SEX FOR DRUGS.

227
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:54,806
        HOLY SHIT!
  AS A KID I USED TO FANTASIZE
ABOUT HAVING SEX WITH YOU.

228
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:58,109
    WHO KNEW ALL I NEEDED WAS
    AN 8-BALL AND A BUS
        STATION BATHROOM?

229
00:12:58,177 --> 00:12:59,978
        ( crowd groans )

230
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,046
          AND SPEAKING
    OF BATHROOM STALLS,

231
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,649
      WHERE'S THAT REDNECK
      FRUIT JEFF FOXWORTHY?

232
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,417
          THERE HE IS.

233
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:08,820
       <i>JEFF, YOU LOOK LIKE</i>
      <i>MAGNUM P.I. WITH AIDS.</i>

234
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,091
            MY BUDDY
      NICK DiPAOLO IS HERE.

235
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,326
    NICK, LOOK AT YOU,
  YOU BIG HUNCHED-OVER GUINEA.

236
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:17,095
     <i>YOU'RE LIKE FONZIE</i>
          <i>SPINA BIFIDA.</i>

237
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:21,699
        AND RENO COLLIER,
        I DON'T KNOW WHO
        OR WHAT THAT IS.

238
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:23,434
        I-- I DON'T KNOW.

239
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:26,004
 I GUESS HE'S PART OF THAT NEXT
    WAVE OF LOW-BROW DIPSHITS

240
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:27,839
         THAT'LL MAKE ME
      WANT TO KILL MYSELF.

241
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,674
     OR MAYBE HE'S JUST HERE
    SO LISA LAMPANELLI

242
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:32,911
      WOULDN'T BE THE ONLY
    FAT LESBIAN HACK ONSTAGE.

243
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,816
          AND NOW ON TO
      LARRY THE CABLE GUY.

244
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,984
        THIS IS EXCITING,
    I GOT TO TELL YOU.

245
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,921
     <i>I'VE NEVER ROASTED</i>
     <i>A FAKE CHARACTER BEFORE.</i>

246
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,690
 MAYBE NEXT YEAR WE COULD ROAST
     SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS.

247
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:49,127
            LARRY...

248
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:50,995
        LARRY'S WHOLE ACT
        IS A SHAM,

249
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:52,997
         LIKE THE BIBLE
        OR THE HOLOCAUST.

250
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:55,433
        ( crowd groans )

251
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,968
         SOME PEOPLE SAY
     LARRY'S ONLY SUCCESSFUL

252
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,837
    'CAUSE HE'S PANDERING TO
  THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR

253
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:01,272
          AND BLATANTLY
    AND NON-IRONICALLY
        EXPLOITING

254
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,675
         PEOPLE'S RACIST
AND HOMOPHOBIC TENDENCIES.

255
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:05,109
         DON'T LISTEN TO
      THESE PEOPLE, LARRY.

256
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,012
    THEY'RE JUST BITTER
     AND JEALOUS AND RIGHT.

257
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,715
      <i>YOU INBRED HILLBILLY.</i>

258
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:14,085
     YOU'VE BEEN INSIDE MORE
    FARM ANIMALS THAN PURINA.

259
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,087
        YOU'RE LIKE
        THE TROJAN ARMY.

260
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:19,324
      YOU'RE BIG, PATRIOTIC
    AND YOU BOTH CAME INSIDE
         A GIANT HORSE.

261
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:23,361
    YOU GRAVY-SWEATING
        COUSIN --.

262
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:27,298
    LARRY -- HIS FIRST COUSIN
         WHEN HE WAS 16

263
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,000
        AND HIS LAST ONE
    ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

264
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,871
         YOU LOST 50 LBS
         ON NUTRISYSTEM

265
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:34,906
         AND ANOTHER 10
WHEN YOU SHAVED YOUR BACK.

266
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:38,877
    HOW THE -- ARE YOU
        SO POPULAR?

267
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:44,382
        JESUS -- CHRIST.
 THIS ONE FINALLY BROKE MY BACK.

268
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:48,286
      YOUR FANS CAN'T EVEN
          AFFORD CABLE.

269
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:49,854
    THEY'RE NOT COMING 'CAUSE
    THEY THINK YOU'RE FUNNY.

270
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,023
    THEY'VE NEVER SEEN
          A CABLE GUY.

271
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:54,325
     YOU COULD HAVE COME UP
WITH OTHER CHARACTERS YOUR
      FANS HAVE NEVER SEEN

272
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,161
     LIKE LARRY THE DENTIST
     OR LARRY THE LIBRARIAN

273
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,130
            OR LARRY
    THE HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA.

274
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:03,868
    THANKS FOR LETTING
      ME ROAST YOU, LARRY.

275
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:06,137
  YOU MAKE MORE MONEY IN A WEEK
THAN I'LL MAKE IN MY LIFE,

276
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:08,273
      AND THAT FEELS GOOD,
      I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU.

277
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,809
YOU SAY YOU'VE NEVER DONE DRUGS,
  BUT WATCHING YOUR SUCCESS HAS
     PUT ME IN REHAB TWICE.

278
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:14,879
  SO THANKS FOR RIPPING MY SOUL
     OUT, YOU HILLBILLY --.

279
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:17,482
          ( cheering )

280
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:22,887
        Announcer:
     <i>COMING UP, TOBY KEITH...</i>

282
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,358
    I THINK I'M OVERDRESSED.

283
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,161
  - <i>...JEFFREY ROSS...</i>
  - LARRY, TAKE IT LIKE A MAN.

284
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,997
  - <i>...JEFF FOXWORTHY...</i>
  - THIS IS THE FILTHIEST SHOW
    I'VE EVER BEEN A PART OF.

285
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:36,034
     - <i>...AND GARY BUSEY.</i>
     - I DON'T KNOW WHAT
       I'M TALKING ABOUT.

286
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,169
  I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT I SAID
         10 SECONDS AGO.

287
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:44,275
    TONIGHT'S NEXT PRESENTER

288
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:47,412
        IS PROUD AMERICAN
        TOBY KEITH.

289
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,280
        - <i>( cheering )</i>
        - <i>YES.</i>

290
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:52,183
    TOBY KEITH ACTUALLY
    SCREENED HIS FILM

291
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:55,520
      "BEER FOR MY HORSES"
    FOR THE SOLDIERS IN IRAQ.

292
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:59,123
     THANKS TO BARACK OBAMA
    REDEFINING TORTURE,

293
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:00,792
        THAT WON'T HAPPEN
        EVER AGAIN.

294
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:04,696
      LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
        TOBY KEITH.

295
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:07,699
 <i>( country music playing )</i>

296
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,675
        YOU ASKED FOR IT.

297
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:20,745
      THAT'S A PRETTY DRESS
        YOU HAVE ON, LIS.

298
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,715
        PINK CAMOUFLAGE,
    THAT'S TRULY NICE.

299
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:26,017
          YOU LOOK LIKE
         APOCALYPSE COW.

300
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,619
  YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN TO IRAQ,
    I'VE BEEN TO AFGHANISTAN,

301
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:30,254
        ABOUT 118 SHOWS,

302
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,790
 BUT LISA STILL HAS THE BIGGEST
    CAMEL TOE I'VE EVER SEEN.

303
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,161
  LET'S TALK ABOUT THESE OTHER
     CITY CLICKERS ONSTAGE.

304
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:41,299
          GREG GIRALDO?
    WHO THE -- IS THAT?

305
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,501
         <i>YOU WERE REALLY</i>
       <i>FUNNY TONIGHT, GREG.</i>

306
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,737
         BETWEEN ROASTS,
GREG HAS TO SELL HIS BLOOD,

307
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:48,206
    SPERM AND FURNITURE
          TO MAKE RENT.

308
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:50,475
        LUCKILY ALL
          HIS FURNITURE

309
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,010
        IS COVERED
    IN BLOOD AND SPERM.

310
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,180
          <i>AND JEFF ROSS</i>
           <i>AND I, MAN,</i>

311
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:57,949
        WE BOTH PERFORMED
         FOR THE TROOPS.

312
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,252
DIFFERENCE IS JEFF CHARGED
         FOR HIS SHOWS.

313
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,622
            AND JEFF,
    YOU AMAZED ME ON "DANCING
     WITH THE STARS," DUDE.

314
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,591
      LAST TIME I SAW MOVES
            THAT HOT,

315
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:09,394
         LISA GOT HER --
      CAUGHT IN HER ZIPPER.

316
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,102
     AND WARREN SAPP'S HERE.
      LOOK AT YOU, WARREN,

317
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,339
 GETTING READY TO DO YOUR FIRST
COMEDY STANDUP DEBUT, MAN.

318
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,808
    YOU LOOK LIKE BERNIE MAC
        AND CHEESE.

319
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,379
  AND MAUREEN McCORMICK'S HERE.
          MARSHA BRADY.

320
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:30,515
      MARSH MARSHA MARSHA.
             MAN...

321
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:34,285
     SHE USED TO GET SO HIGH
    ON COKE SHE'D HEAR VOICES
          IN HER HEAD.

322
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:37,021
      TOO BAD NONE OF THEM
      WAS AN ACTING COACH.

323
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:43,094
    HER COUNTRY MUSIC CAREER
    WAS SUCH A TRAGIC EVENT,

324
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,763
      I COULD HAVE WRITTEN
     THREE ALBUMS ABOUT IT.

325
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:48,666
      HER MUSIC WAS SO BAD
I FORGAVE THE DIXIE CHICKS.

326
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:54,405
    AND IT'S REALLY AN HONOR
    FOR ME TO BE HERE TONIGHT
      WITH GARY BUSEY, MAN.

327
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:56,474
    GARY BUSEY IS HERE.
HE'S A GOOD OLD TEXAS BOY.

328
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,943
          <i>OKLAHOMA BOY.</i>

329
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:03,881
    YOU KNOW, GARY NEVER GOT
HIS STAR ON HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD,

330
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:07,518
 BUT, DUDE, YOU DID LEAVE A NOSE
    ON PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY.

331
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,021
      THE ONLY GUY WHO MADE
     WORSE TRAVEL DECISIONS

332
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,056
         THAN YOU, PAL,
        WAS BUDDY HOLLY.

333
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:14,425
         <i>( crowd groans )</i>

334
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:15,726
              IS IT TOO EARLY
              FOR THAT SHIT?

335
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,198
    AND JEFF FOXWORTHY
          IS SO POPULAR

336
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,400
HE HAS FANS THAT FOLLOW HIM
    FROM SHOW TO SHOW,

337
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:25,136
WHICH IS PRETTY EASY TO DO
  WHEN THEY LIVE IN THEIR CAR.

338
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:29,140
    SAY WHAT Y'ALL WANT
         TO ABOUT JEFF,

339
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,576
     BUT HE'S THE ONLY CLEAN
    COMIC ON THE STAGE.

340
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:34,245
      BY THAT I MEAN HE CAN
        PASS A DRUG TEST.

341
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:37,248
            HIS URINE
        IS CRYSTAL CLEAR.

342
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,484
     AND ACCORDING TO LARRY,
    A LITTLE BIT SALTY.

343
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:50,228
    OH COME ON, LARRY'S BEEN
      BLOWING JEFF SO LONG

344
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,029
          THEY COULD BE
          COUSINS, MAN.

345
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:55,099
     AND YOU DON'T SEE A LOT
  OF PEOPLE AROUND LOS ANGELES

346
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,634
        DRESS LIKE LARRY,
            YOU KNOW?

347
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:59,470
    UNLESS IT'S LESBO BOWLING
    NIGHT AT HOLLYWOOD LANES.

348
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,641
        IN "DELTA FARCE"
    LARRY MADE MOVIE HISTORY.

349
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,810
      HE WAS THE FIRST GUY
      EVER TO PLAY A RETARD

350
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,178
      AND NOT WIN AN OSCAR.

351
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:12,683
        ( all laughing )

352
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:16,187
  AND IT'S A GREAT GREAT THING
THAT LARRY'S ON NUTRISYSTEM

353
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:18,322
  BECAUSE IF HIS FAT, PASTY ASS
         GOT ANY FATTER,

354
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,725
      WARREN SAPP WOULD BE
        TRYING TO -- IT.

355
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:23,161
        ( crowd groans )

356
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:30,034
        TRUTH IS, LARRY,
YOU PUT A LOT OF SMILES ON
    A LOT OF PEOPLE'S FACES.

357
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,869
        TIMES BEING
         WHAT THEY ARE,

358
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,038
     I'D SAY THAT MAKES YOU
    A PRETTY GREAT MAN.

359
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:36,674
        YOU MAY NOT BE SMART,
        YOU MAY NOT BE FUNNY,

360
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:39,010
        BUT SOMEHOW
        YOU'RE A SUCCESS.

361
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:42,079
    LARRY SYMBOLIZES ALL THAT
      AMERICA HAS TO OFFER.

362
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:43,548
         AND AS I SPEAK,

363
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:46,350
     THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF
 TROOPS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN

364
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:48,519
    SERVING TO PROTECT
          THAT DREAM--

365
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:51,189
    THAT AND TO GET AS
         FAR AS POSSIBLE

366
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:53,591
         AWAY FROM LARRY
         THE CABLE GUY.

367
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,293
        GOOD NIGHT.

368
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,129
     <i>( music playing )</i>

369
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:07,672
    OUR NEXT ROASTER IS
THE ONLY PERSON ON THE DAIS

370
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:10,241
      WHO HAS TACKLED MORE
    BLACK MEN THAN ME--

371
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,910
          WARREN SAPP!

372
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:14,946
      <i>( rock music playing )</i>

373
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,158
        LET'S HEAR IT FOR
LISA LAMPANELLI, OR AS WE--

374
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,393
           <i>( cheering )</i>

375
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,429

         AROUND OUR WAY,

376
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:33,731
        "OH, THAT BITCH."

377
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,867
     LISA'S VAGINA IS KNOWN
          AS THE LIMO,

378
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:40,271
      'CAUSE IT FITS EIGHT,
    IT HAS LEATHER INTERIOR,

379
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:42,440
    AND I CAME IN IT TONIGHT.

380
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,709
        ( all cheering )

381
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:52,049
     I HAVE TO SAY, THIS IS
  A TRULY SPECIAL NIGHT FOR ME.

382
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:54,518
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE
    EVER SEEN TOBY AND LARRY

383
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,621
     WITHOUT THEIR HOODS ON.

384
00:20:56,688 --> 00:21:00,324
THE ONLY BLACK THING YOU'LL
SEE AT A TOBY KEITH CONCERT

385
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,393
        IS A WOMAN'S EYE.

    WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT,
          NICK DiPAOLO?

388
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:13,271
        YOU'RE SO RACIST,
     EVERY TIME BARACK OBAMA
      GETS UP ON THE STAGE,

389
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:15,273
     YOU TRY AND BID ON HIM.

00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,908
      <i>( laughing, hooting )</i>

391

      <i>SEEN HIM ON A NETWORK.</i>

394
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:32,256
    MOVE YOUR CRAZY WHITE ASS
          AWAY FROM ME.

395
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:35,426
  I'D HATE TO TANGLE WITH A GUY
  WITH MULTIPLE PERSONALITIES.

396
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:37,728
IT'S LIKE GETTING JUMPED ON
          BY SIX DUDES

397
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:41,165
        AND THREE OF THEM

FROM DIFFERENT FAMILIES ALL
     LIVING UNDER ONE ROOF.

400
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:52,677
HOW IN THE HELL AIN'T THERE
    A BLACK PERSON ON THERE?

401

        HAS A ROPE
        HANGING FROM IT,

405
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,288
          YOU MIGHT BE

408
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:17,134
    IF YOU THINK HALLE BERRY
     IS SOMETHING YOU GET AT
          JAMBA JUICE,

409
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:20,237
          YOU MIGHT BE
        A CRACKER.

410

412
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:29,347
          YOU MIGHT BE
        A CRACKER.

413
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:32,750
        AND IF YOU THINK
    THE SOUL TRAIN IS A LINE
        OF BROTHERS

414

     BEHIND LISA LAMPANELLI,

415
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:37,822
        WELL, OKAY,
THAT WOULD BE A SOUL TRAIN.

      THE GUEST OF HONOR--

THEY SHOULD HAVE CALLED YOU
    "LARRY THE CABLE GUIDE."

421
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,410
    AND LARRY, LOOK AT
    YOUR RAGGEDY-ASS CLOTHES.

422
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:02,146
         HOW THE HELL DO
        YOU EXPECT TO GET
SOME -- LOOKING LIKE THAT?

423
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:05,182
    EVEN YOUR SISTER GAVE YOU
      A FAKE PHONE NUMBER.

424
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:10,087
      LARRY, I'VE DEALT OUT
      A LOT OF HARD HITS ON
    THE FOOTBALL FIELD,

425
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,623
     AND I GOT TO GIVE IT UP
     TO YOU FOR WHAT YOU'RE
      TAKING HERE TONIGHT.

426

    I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO
     BE LARRY THE CABLE GUY

428
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:20,731
         BECAUSE TONIGHT
        I SOLD OUT.

429
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,000
    SORRY, BLACK FOLKS.
        GOOD NIGHT.

00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:45,923
 THAT I CAN'T BE THERE TONIGHT,
 BUT IT'S PROBABLY JUST AS WELL

439
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:48,259
      BECAUSE TO BE HONEST,
      I JUST DON'T GET IT.

440
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:51,762
WE'RE ROASTING A GUY WHOSE
 SUCCESS HINGES ON TWO PHRASES:

441
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,832
 "NOW THAT'S FUNNY RIGHT THERE"
        AND "GIT-R-DONE."

442
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,101
     I MEAN, THE ONLY THING
    THIS GUY'S REPEATED MORE
        THAN "GIT-R-DONE"

443
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:58,569
      IS THE EIGHTH GRADE.

444
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:01,605
    I MEAN, HIS WHOLE CAREER
IS BASED ON A LIE, PEOPLE.

445
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:03,941
      HIS NAME ISN'T LARRY,
      HE'S NOT A CABLE GUY,

446
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:06,510
      AND FOR GOD'S SAKES,
    HE ISN'T AN ACTOR.

447
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:08,979
         IN ALL THREE OF
    HIS "BLOCKBUSTER" MOVIES,

448
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:10,748
     THEY TRIED TO MAKE HIM
    THE LOVE INTEREST.

449
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:12,383
        I MEAN, COME ON.

450
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,552
CASTING LARRY THE CABLE GUY
    AS A LOVE INTEREST

451
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,854
         IS LIKE CASTING

452

WHAT YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED--

456
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,230
  YOU'RE A VERY FUNNY COMEDIAN;

    YOU'RE A WONDERFUL FATHER
     AND A DEVOTED HUSBAND;

458
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,569
      AND I AM PROUD TO SAY
     THAT YOU ARE MY FRIEND.

     ISN'T YOUR BOYFRIEND--

477
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:33,964
      HE WOULD HAVE PUNCHED
      HIMSELF IN THE FACE.

      THIS IS RIDICULOUS--
     NOT EVEN A REAL PERSON.

495
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:25,716
HOW COME NOBODY TALKS ABOUT
    YOUR OTHER PERSONAS

496
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:27,918
    YOU TRIED OUT THAT
    DIDN'T WORK OUT SO WELL?

 DISCOVERED LARRY THE CABLE GUY

00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:41,565
    WHEN HE WAS PART OF
  THE BLUE COLLAR COMEDY TOUR.

501

              YEAH.

    WHY'D YOU GUYS BREAK UP?
     UNCREATIVE DIFFERENCES?

     AN EIGHT-DRINK MINIMUM

     <i>YOUR PRESENTATION,</i>

600
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:07,758
      I RECEIVED COMPELLING
        INFORMATION

601
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:10,928

          BE A REDNECK.

        RESEARCH ON LARRY

603

    AND THEY TOLD ME TO FIND
        HIS MOVIES

605

     FROM WITNESS PROTECTION

     WHERE THERE'S A CHANCE
     SOMEBODY MIGHT SEE YOU.

  IS GONNA FLY OFF THE SHELVES

611
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:47,030
         IS IF A TORNADO

 AND EVERY TIME I HEAR HIS JOKES

844

        IT REMINDS ME TO

    LISA'S CD IN A TRUCK STOP

00:47:56,139 --> 00:48:00,376
      THREE HOURS FROM NOW,
     LARRY'S GONNA BE ON HIS
    LEARJET HEADED HOME

871
00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:03,479
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE SITTING
        IN THE DRIVE-THRU

     YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ALWAYS
      ASK ME, "DID YOU SEE
     LARRY'S LATEST MOVIE?"

875
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:21,864
      I ALWAYS ANSWER, "NO,
    BUT I FLUSHED A $10 BILL

876
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:24,166

I ACTUALLY HAD A CHANCE TO
      BE IN "DELTA FARCE,"

878
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:34,176
  BUT I COULDN'T DO IT BECAUSE

              UH...

880
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:41,117

    ENJOY LARRY'S MOVIES

881
00:48:41,184 --> 00:48:44,553
        IS NEVER PUT 'EM IN

  YOU KNOW, TALKING WITH LARRY
      DEEP INTO THE NIGHT.

891
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:18,955
     AND HE WAS JUST ALWAYS
    SO EAGER TO LEARN--

892
00:49:19,022 --> 00:49:21,991
        CONSTANTLY ASKING
         QUESTIONS LIKE,

893
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:25,461
      "IS SECOND BASE OVER
 THE SHIRT OR UNDER THE SHIRT?"

894
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:27,997
    AT WHICH POINT I WOULD GO
         TO RON'S BUNK,

895
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:31,467
  PULL OUT THE INFLATABLE DOLL
AND SHOW HIM ONE MORE TIME.

896
00:49:33,537 --> 00:49:35,137
    THE AMAZING THING
    TO ME

897
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:37,039
        IS HE'S
        HAPPILY MARRIED.

898
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:40,343
        SHE'S MISERABLE,
    BUT HE'S HAPPY AS A CLAM.

899
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:43,512
        I KNOW IT'S TOUGH
    HAVING LITTLE KIDS

900
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:46,015

          ALL THE TIME.

901
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:48,351
    IN FACT, I ASKED LARRY'S
        WIFE CARA--

902
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:50,686
      I SAID, "HOW DO YOU
        AND LARRY DO IT?"

903
00:49:50,754 --> 00:49:53,055
        SHE SAID, "I JUST
          CLOSE MY EYES

904
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:55,524
        AND PRETEND
      IT ISN'T HAPPENING."

905
00:49:57,561 --> 00:49:59,862
    SHE SAID CONCEIVING THOSE
          TWO CHILDREN

906
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:03,232
          WAS THE WORST
     30 SECONDS OF HER LIFE.

     <i>THE COOLEST THING?</i>

908

        TO SHARE HIS ART

      WITH THE WORLD WHILE
      REMAINING TRUE TO HIS
    INBRED, ILLITERATE ROOTS.

910
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:19,215

        GO TO YOUR HEAD.

      GREG GIRALDO, LET ME
    ASK YOU A QUESTION.

914

        YOU KNOW HOW MANY
    FUNNEL CAKES YOU CAN BUY

00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:32,608
         WITH A HANDFUL
            OF PRELL.

970
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:38,414
         <i>-- GARY BUSEY--</i>

     A BRAIN INJURY TO HEAL?

972
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,785
          JESUS CHRIST.

973
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:47,823
    APPARENTLY, GARY DAMAGED
     EVERY PART OF THE BRAIN

974
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:49,892
        EXCEPT FOR ONE--
        THE ASSHOLE LOBE.

00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:11,480
         I SAW WARREN ON
    "DANCING WITH THE STARS."

979
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:14,216
      IT WAS LIKE WATCHING
     A LEATHER COUCH DURING
         AN EARTHQUAKE.

980
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:20,422
I HEARD HIS AGENT BACKSTAGE
      ARGUING ON THE PHONE

981
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:22,258
    ABOUT HIS CONTRACT
         FOR THE ROAST.

982
00:54:22,325 --> 00:54:24,159
I ACTUALLY HEARD HIS AGENT
        SAY THIS--

983
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:27,997
  "NO NO NO, I SAID, '45 ACRES
    AND <i>THREE</i> MULES.'"

             JESUS.

992
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:49,952
  WHAT CAN YOU SAY ABOUT A GUY
WHO LOOKS LIKE BRETT FAVRE,

993
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,820
     SOUNDS LIKE GOMER PYLE

994
00:54:51,888 --> 00:54:55,758
        AND DRESSES LIKE
        ELLEN DeGENERES?

995
00:54:55,825 --> 00:54:57,960
    WE ALL KNOW HIS REAL NAME
         IS DAN WHITNEY,

996
00:54:58,028 --> 00:55:00,663
 BUT HE HAD TO CHANGE IT BECAUSE
  IT HAD THE WORD "WIT" IN IT.

999
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:07,736
        YET HALF HIS FANS
    AREN'T GOING TO SEE THIS

1000
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:10,439
    BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T MADE

     <i>RIGHT NOW IN APPALACHIA,</i>

        A LONG FACE

1007
00:55:32,128 --> 00:55:34,363
      SNIFFING HIS FINGERS.
  I SAID, "WHAT'S THE MATTER?"

1008
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:37,533
            HE GOES,
    "I MISS MY FAMILY."

1009
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:41,603
    LARRY KNOWS NOTHING
         ABOUT POLITICS.

1010
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:44,273
I ASKED HIM WHAT HE THOUGHT
  OF OBAMA'S STIMULUS PACKAGE,

1011
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:46,608
  AND HE SAID, "WHAT CAN I SAY?
     BLACK GUYS GOT BIG --."

1012
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:51,213
          THANKS A LOT.

         HE'S FUNNY NOW,

1016
00:55:58,054 --> 00:56:00,255

      BUT NICK DiPAOLO HAD
        THE INSIDE TRACK

1105
01:01:00,089 --> 01:01:02,991
    TO DO "SMARTER THAN
A FIFTH GRADER" OVER JEFF.

1106
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:05,661
    AND HE ALMOST GOT IT AND
  THEN THE EXECUTIVES FOUND OUT

1107
01:01:05,728 --> 01:01:08,430
    THAT NICK WASN'T ALLOWED
          WITHIN 500yds

1108
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:11,967
    OF A FIFTH GRADER.

1109
01:01:12,035 --> 01:01:14,102
              <i>SO...</i>

1110
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:16,171
    AND THAT BRINGS ME

1111
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:18,607
    TO ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS
        AND MENTORS

1112
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:21,510
    IN THE WHOLE WORLD
      OF COMEDY, AND THAT'S
    MY BUDDY JEFF FOXWORTHY.

1113
01:01:22,712 --> 01:01:25,781
          <i>THAT'S RIGHT.</i>

1114
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:28,650
      JEFF WAS KIND ENOUGH
     TO TAKE ME ON THE ROAD

1115
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:30,786
      WITH HIM AT THE PEAK
         OF HIS CAREER.

1116
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:34,456
      AND HE KEPT DOING IT
        EVEN AFTER 1997.

1117
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:40,429
         YOU KNOW WHAT?
     I'VE BEEN WANTING TO DO
 THIS JOKE FOR JEFF A LONG TIME.

1118
01:01:40,496 --> 01:01:43,699
         BUT THIS IS ONE
    I COME UP WITH THAT MAYBE
          YOU CAN USE:

1119
01:01:43,766 --> 01:01:46,368
      IF YOU UNDERESTIMATE
 THE TALENT OF YOUR OPENING ACT

1120
01:01:46,436 --> 01:01:48,870
AND WATCH HIM GO ON TO MAKE
      MORE MONEY THAN YOU,

1121
01:01:48,938 --> 01:01:51,406
          YOU MIGHT BE
        A REDNECK.

1122
01:01:59,348 --> 01:02:01,550
    AND WITH THAT SAID,

1123
01:02:01,617 --> 01:02:04,486
    I GOTTA SAY, IT WAS
A BLAST TO SIT HERE TONIGHT

1124
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:07,355
    AND TAKE THE SHOTS.
     YOU KNOW, I'M A PRETTY
          EASY TARGET.

1125
01:02:07,423 --> 01:02:09,725
         IT WASN'T HARD
    TO MAKE FUN OF ME, SO...

1126
01:02:09,792 --> 01:02:12,461
        I JUST GOTTA SAY,
      I'VE GOT HUGE RESPECT
     FOR EVERYBODY UP HERE.

1127
01:02:12,528 --> 01:02:14,162
      EVERYBODY UP HERE IS
        A FRIEND OF MINE.

1128
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:16,331
 I'M HONORED TO BE SITTING RIGHT
  THERE IN THE ROASTING CHAIR.

1129
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:18,667
I'M HONORED THAT THESE GUYS
    THINK ENOUGH OF ME

1130
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:20,969
  TO COME OUT HERE AND MAKE FUN
    OF HOW MUCH I SUCK.

1131
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:23,171
        I REALLY DO
        APPRECIATE THAT.

1132
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:25,907
     BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU,
  I LIKE MAKING PEOPLE LAUGH--

1133
01:02:25,975 --> 01:02:27,476
    I LOVE DOING THAT.

1134
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:29,578
        AND I'M GLAD THAT
         PEOPLE LIKE IT.

1135
01:02:29,645 --> 01:02:32,514
         AND I JUST WANT
     TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR
    LETTING ME LIVE MY DREAM

1136
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,483
          OF BEING ABLE
          TO DO COMEDY.

1137
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:37,052
    AND I TAKE MY INSPIRATION
         FROM THE FELLOW

1138
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:40,021
        THAT WROTE THIS:

1139
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:43,525
    ( British accent )
"TO THINE OWN SELF BE TRUE,

1140
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:46,828
    AND IT MUST FOLLOW
      AS THE DAY THE NIGHT,

1141
01:02:46,896 --> 01:02:50,432
    THOU CANST NOT THEN
            BE FALSE

1142
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,200
          TO ANY MAN!"

1143
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:55,771
      BUT THAT DON'T FIT ON
A BALL CAP, SO GIT-R-DONE!

1144
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:58,306
         <i>( all cheering )</i>

1145
01:02:58,374 --> 01:03:00,375
- <i>( rock music playing )</i>
- THANKS AGAIN.

1146
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:20,862
      <i>â™ª SWEET HOME ALABAMA </i>

1147
01:03:22,932 --> 01:03:25,567
     <i>â™ª WHERE THE SKIES</i>
         <i>ARE SO BLUE... â™ª</i>

1148
01:03:26,702 --> 01:03:29,538
U ARE HEE-HAWFUL.

1149
01:03:29,605 --> 01:03:31,439
           <i>( laughing )</i>

1150
01:03:31,507 --> 01:03:34,776
LARRY, I'VE SEEN YOUR ACT--
    YOU ARE HEE-HAWFUL.

1151
01:03:36,679 --> 01:03:38,680
THE ONLY THING MORE CLOGGED
        THAN YOUR TOILET

1152
01:03:38,748 --> 01:03:41,249
    - IS YOUR ARTERIES.
      - <i>( light chuckles )</i>

1153
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:43,084
     - --IS YOUR ARTERIES.
     - <i>( laughter )</i>

1154
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:44,719
    IT WORKED FOR JEFF ROSS.

1155
01:03:44,787 --> 01:03:47,622
     LARRY'S SUCH A RACIST,
 TO GET HIM TO THE SHOW TONIGHT,

1156
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:51,226
      HIS AGENT AND MANAGER
      WERE "MEIN KAMPF"ED.

1157
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:53,795
     "MEIN KAMPF"ED, HE SAID
     TO THE DRUNKEN BITCHES
         FROM HOLLYWOOD

1158
01:03:53,863 --> 01:03:55,564
WHO WOULDN'T GET A JOKE IF
     IT BIT THEM IN THE --.

1159
01:03:55,631 --> 01:03:56,998
      HE DID GOOD, DIDN'T HE?

1160
01:03:57,066 --> 01:03:59,000
 - THANK YOU SO MUCH.
 - HIS FIRST ROAST HE EVER DID.

1161
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:01,536
     I FEEL LIKE ALL IN ALL,
 IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST ROASTS.

1162
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:03,872
I GOT HAMMERED PRETTY GOOD.
          I ENJOYED IT.

1163
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:06,541
YOU KNOW WHAT THE WORD
FUN STANDS FOR-- F-U-N?

1164
01:04:06,609 --> 01:04:09,144
"FINALLY UNDERSTANDING
NOTHING."

1165
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:10,712
THAT'S FUN.
