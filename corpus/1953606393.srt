1
00:00:03,269 --> 00:00:08,263
THE AURORA SHOW

2
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:18,349
To the north, upon a plain, not so big,

3
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:21,214
there is a giant projector.

4
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:26,423
It's a planetarium that projects
the stars in the nightly sky

5
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,399
Operators come and go...

6
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:37,436
while the machine survives the ages.

7
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,340
It may seem a romantic job

8
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:43,339
but in fact it's quite though.

9
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:48,247
The operator is permanently busy
fixing the machine

10
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:16,237
During daytime the operator drinks coffee,
at a nearby cafeteria.

11
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,436
It's his only hobby

12
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,249
It may not be great coffee,

13
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,416
but because he can always sit there
on his own, it gives him time to rest.

14
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,363
A ship passes by, hooping...

15
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:51,267
as if announcing a new season.

16
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:57,249
The operator sighs, because he knows
the new season will get him very busy again

17
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,275
Every time the season changes,

18
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,244
he has to adjust the machine.

19
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,247
He must oil some parts, replace
the batteries and change the reels.

20
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,384
The summer constellation

21
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,411
has to be projected in the summer,

22
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:36,446
and the winter constellation

23
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:38,354
runs only in wintertime.

24
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,361
It's a job that needs a lot of attention.

25
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:03,406
One day, at the usual cafeteria,

26
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,445
a new customer arrives.

27
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:20,490
The man explains

28
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,468
he comes from the south

29
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,470
just to see the aurora.

30
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,337
He said the people from his country

31
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:36,442
work hard every day...

32
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,218
...just to travel to the northern country

33
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:43,481
and watch the beautiful aurora...

34
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:48,284
displayed on the night sky.

35
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,358
Little did the man realize...

36
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,228
that he sat oppose...

37
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,266
the planetarium operator.

38
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:47,250
While traveling the realm of dream...

39
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:49,312
I discovered the little planet "Phantasmagoria".

40
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:56,228
This has been a story from that planet.

41
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:59,322
Till next time!

42
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:23,222
THE COLOR FACTORY FROM RAINBOW VALLEY

43
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,468
There is a paint factory

44
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,503
in the Rainbow Valley.

45
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:53,249
I work there.

46
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,420
To make our paints,

47
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:59,322
we scrape chunks from a shiny rainbow

48
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,416
which materialized here in the past.

49
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:06,455
As far as I can remember,

50
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:11,532
not other rainbow has appeared.

51
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:15,431
The factory has been in decline
the last years

52
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:20,412
and maybe I will loose my job.

53
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:54,472
Every night I go to the city

54
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:02,446
in search of booze.

55
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:06,417
Since there is nothing else to do,

56
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:11,328
day after day... I wake up drunk

57
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:19,233
One day...

58
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,502
I heard a story about a place...

59
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,344
called: Shooting star Hill

60
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:29,439
where often falling stars come down.

61
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:35,514
Those fallen meteors, when found,
are sold for a fortune

62
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:45,389
That's why I decided to go south,

63
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:49,365
hoping to make fast money.

64
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:11,379
But my hopes got shattered.

65
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,257
Not a single meteor was seen...

66
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:19,431
It took me more then a month,
before I got it...

67
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,508
I realized...

68
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:41,410
I had to come back.

69
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,258
The smell of the paint factory

70
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,283
welcomed me.

71
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,361
What should I do now?

72
00:08:57,503 --> 00:09:01,269
Stay until everything was lost?

73
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:03,401
Then...

74
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:08,312
...I could not believe my eyes.

75
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,545
Right there in front of me,

76
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:17,455
there was a new rainbow

77
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:22,324
that we craved for so much.

78
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,233
In my surprise it came back to me.

79
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:37,442
How much I loved rainbows.

80
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:03,468
While travelling the realm of dream...

81
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,262
I discovered the little planet
"Phantasmagoria".

82
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:11,502
This was a story from that planet.

83
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,336
Till next time!

84
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:36,231
GLASSY OCEAN

85
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:15,337
The surface is made of glass...

86
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:23,348
...it waves softly.

87
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:37,462
Inside, a great number of creatures live.

88
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,435
To capture a prey from outside

89
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,437
takes a lot of effort.

90
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:24,238
Telegraphic posts go to work.

91
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:39,252
The moon rises from the surface!

92
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,377
How are you?

93
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,491
Eight sardines.

94
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,456
Maybe tomorrow, I'll go

95
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:22,228
to where the Element IX is.

96
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:34,244
No way, that's a dangerous place.

97
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:36,510
You'll get completely burned!

98
00:13:56,368 --> 00:14:00,270
You see? He's also a victim.

99
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:08,403
When I see ships, I can't avoid it.

100
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:16,445
Have you ever been?

101
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,465
I was a sailor.

102
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,407
The last ship on which I sailed...

103
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:47,351
was called "Gondwana"

104
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:57,295
It was a beautiful Ship.

105
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:16,242
While travelling the realm of dream...

106
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,246
I found the little planet "Phantasmagoria".

107
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:23,345
This is a small story from that planet.

108
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:26,290
Till next time!

109
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:49,407
THE SOUTHERN COUNTRY

110
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:05,287
"Rager", Land of Snowmen, is the coldest
skate rink in the world at -86°F.

111
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:09,290
Today marks the end of the season.

112
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:14,361
Starting tomorrow, the snowmen will begin
preparations to help Santa Claus for Xmas.

113
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:47,238
Just now, Santa has come back from gathering
all kinds of presents from all over the world.

114
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:53,438
The southern country Santa Claus talks about
a lot, is a real traveller's paradise.

115
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:03,385
The south is a strange place.

116
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:07,425
There is a region where everything turns square,

117
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:14,228
an island where exotic plants bear dinosaurs,

118
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:21,497
another island where crystals reflect rainbow
colors and robots try to chisel them out in vain.

119
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:28,378
Yeah... everything sounds really amazing.

120
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:34,475
The snowman Santa told all this to,
decided to go and see it for himself.

121
00:17:53,305 --> 00:18:02,441
A few days later, the snowman escaped silently,
and took the train that headed south.

122
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:19,226
What he saw through the window
was indeed very strange...

123
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:29,339
A city made of bread
with a soft and sweet smell...

124
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:37,278
A planetarium projecting the stars
on the night sky...

125
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:46,281
or a very dizzying labyrinth city.

126
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:53,322
One after another, it was a wonderful world,
new to his eyes.

127
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:13,510
After 3 days, around the 300th view, the breeze
and smell of the peppermint made him remember...

128
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,250
...and miss his town in the north

129
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:37,298
Exactly 5 days after departure.
The train at last arrived to the last stop,
The Hotel at the Frontier Limit.

130
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:43,247
However, there wasn't a snowman
found anymore, among the passengers.

131
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:49,421
Yeah, the south mainland, even at night time,
is really too hot for snowmen.

132
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:04,359
Xmas is coming soon.

133
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:28,291
While traveling the realm of dreams...

134
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:31,421
[discovered a small planet called: "Phantasmagoria".

135
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:35,494
This has been a small story from that planet.

136
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:37,393
Till next time!

137
00:20:56,421 --> 00:21:02,485
THE DAY THE LIGHT BULB SHONE

138
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:14,336
There's an antique left

139
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:17,271
from 4,500 years back:

140
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:20,369
It's a light bulb.

141
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:24,245
Nobody knows it's purpose.

142
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,337
While travelling the realm of dreams...

143
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,502
I discovered this little planet, "Phantasmagoria".

144
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:50,277
This was a story from that planet.

145
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:53,274
Till next time!

146
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:16,340
GHOST TOWN

147
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:31,387
Every year when autumn arrives

148
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:46,403
the town gets its energy back...

149
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:54,344
...from past times of prosperity.

150
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:18,458
The Ice columns begin to melt
at Dragon hill peak

151
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,388
And all over the planet the ghosts
get restless

152
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,454
Many take the opportunity

153
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:19,453
to commit crimes.

154
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:49,324
Finally the ghosts get on the move...

155
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:05,407
They all head towards ghost town.

156
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:35,329
Tonight is the annual celebration...

157
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:54,487
...of the ghosts carnival.

158
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:26,288
While traveling through the realm of dreams,

159
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:30,420
I found a little planet called "Phantasmagoria".

160
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:34,487
This was a little story from that planet.

161
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:37,399
Till next time!

162
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:59,379
MUSHROOM TOWN

163
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:45,487
Hi, long time no see.

164
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:49,364
Everyday is sunny.

165
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:52,402
By the way, last night

166
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:55,531
a walking building passed through.

167
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:59,340
That is very strange.

168
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:07,348
It was headed south.

169
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:16,351
Maybe it wanted to see the ocean again.

170
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:19,488
I wonder,

171
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:24,230
because every day is sunny.

172
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:36,329
The week passed and at last it rained.

173
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:03,529
Everybody had waited for it to start raining.

174
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,264
While travelling the realm of dreams...

175
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:41,499
I discovered al little planet called "Phantasmagoria".

176
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:46,443
This is a story from that planet.

177
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:49,377
Till next time!

178
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:12,460
DISTILLERY

179
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:46,463
This city, that is mysteriously moonshine
illuminated... is the distillery town.

180
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:52,332
In this town there are many
illegal whisky distilleries.

181
00:36:54,445 --> 00:37:01,476
Alcohol spirits roam around in the village, which
sometimes leads to the strangest visual phenomena.

182
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:22,464
It's like the whole town is constantly intoxicated.

183
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:37,516
The one that distills the liquor is Abram.

184
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:41,252
Once a week he leaves town

185
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:44,261
His cart loaded with his own whisky.

186
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:52,266
There's a bar at which every night

187
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,329
all the stars gather.

188
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:05,246
They never mention the illegal liquor,

189
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:07,513
but everybody knows about it.

190
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:11,449
They talk about it's mysterious flavor
and aroma

191
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:18,394
and about the fascinating hallucinations.

192
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:34,469
The whisky made by Abram

193
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:38,243
passes through a lot of hands...

194
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:43,319
...being distributed along secret routes.

195
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:03,439
When the moon shines in the night,

196
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:07,409
a horse pulled chariot arrives to the pier

197
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:10,405
When people sleep,

198
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:13,279
they unload it in silence.

199
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:21,357
The sudden sound of a siren.

200
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:24,292
Tension rises.

201
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:52,320
It's the next day at the liquor store.

202
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:55,382
The illegal liquor provider says:

203
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:59,227
"They almost caught me last night"

204
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,457
"You should be careful, old man"

205
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:05,235
the store owner replied.

206
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:16,245
"Hey, don't worry. These things happen".

207
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:27,381
"Look, the fishes believe the same".

208
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:51,507
While traveling through the realm of dreams...

209
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:55,474
I found a little planet called "Phantasmagoria".

210
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:59,252
This was a story from that planet.

211
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:02,290
Till next time!

212
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:26,282
CACTUS CITY

213
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:33,355
I was born on Dragon Island.

214
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:37,417
It's the largest island of Emerald Bay.

215
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:39,520
It's also a much visited place

216
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:42,528
where rare plant species

217
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,393
and animals live freely.

218
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:49,272
It cost me a lot to make friends

219
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,500
cause I'm covered with thorns

220
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:54,335
and my looks are scary.

221
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:59,415
One day I tried to dance,
so I moved my body

222
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:03,320
but everybody laughed at me

223
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,345
Despite everybody laughed...

224
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:08,357
I made friends...

225
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:44,292
The humans came one day,

226
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:47,396
destroyed the island egotistically,

227
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:51,457
they took me with them.

228
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:11,250
After being on a boat for a long time

229
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:13,449
finally we arrived to a liquor store.

230
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:15,458
I would become an ornament there.

231
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:21,328
Even though the stars looked beautiful,
reflecting on the ocean...

232
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:26,335
I nevertheless didn't stay there for long.

233
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:36,377
One of the stars that went there...

234
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:41,274
fancied me, and took me to another place

235
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:43,453
It was the Altair bar,

236
00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:47,482
the one frequented by stars.

237
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:55,298
I became someone famous

238
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:58,267
because of my way of moving.

239
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:06,238
Do you understand me now?

240
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:09,473
It's true, you knew me then...

241
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:12,243
and were very kind to me.

242
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:15,409
I thank you so much for that.

243
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:21,449
You never minded about my thorns.

244
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:25,362
And always were so good to me.

245
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:28,455
I really mean it. Thanks a lot.

246
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:34,461
It may come as a surprise to you that
I'll be leaving soon. Sorry for that...

247
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:39,441
It's because I overheard a customer.

248
00:44:40,277 --> 00:44:45,237
It seems that there exists
a cactus city in the south.

249
00:44:46,283 --> 00:44:49,309
More of my people live there.

250
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:55,417
When I gave it a thought,
I couldn't keep still anymore!

251
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:04,392
It was nice to have met you!

252
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:11,238
Yes, I'll leave tomorrow.
I'm heading to Cactus City.

253
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:04,256
While travelling through the realm of dreams...

254
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:07,286
I found this little planet called "Phantasmagoria".

255
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:12,232
This was a story from that planet.

256
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:15,271
Till next time!

257
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:39,326
THE HON-YARA BAKERY.

258
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:22,365
Baking county has a bread build bakery.
The Hon-Yara Bakery produces bread.

259
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:38,381
Everybody loves the smell
of recently baked bread.

260
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:49,323
Ah, flocks of birds are attracted soon

261
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:52,460
because of the smell of bread.

262
00:48:14,524 --> 00:48:20,224
The bakery is always in danger.

263
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:33,341
That day they talked about
cleaning the chimney.

264
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:45,483
It was done by an man from Cookie town.

265
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:53,421
He told us stories about Cookie town.

266
00:48:53,463 --> 00:48:55,522
Everywhere it's the same, it's tough.

267
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:26,524
The Hon-Yara Bakery is made
ready to bake bread again.

268
00:49:51,355 --> 00:49:52,515
Mice also like

269
00:49:52,522 --> 00:49:55,491
the smell of recently baked bread.

270
00:50:18,448 --> 00:50:23,385
Life isn't easy for the bakers
of Baking County

271
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:50,310
While travelling through the realm of dreams.

272
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:53,339
I found a little planet called "Phantasmagoria".

273
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:57,452
This has been story from that planet.

274
00:50:58,288 --> 00:51:01,257
Till next time!

275
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:22,470
THE ALTAIR BAR

276
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:32,321
Many billon years have passed

277
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:34,482
while traveling in an orbit

278
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:37,460
through this vast universe.

279
00:51:56,513 --> 00:52:01,314
I finally landed here again.

280
00:52:04,387 --> 00:52:08,323
My shine is about to end.

281
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:11,484
I'm old.

282
00:52:14,498 --> 00:52:17,262
I should turn myself into a meteorite

283
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:20,393
to fall burning to the ground.

284
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:31,314
The Altair Bar?

285
00:52:31,348 --> 00:52:34,511
Maybe if I go there...

286
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:53,234
I'm pretty sure it was here.

287
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:58,235
I can't see it anywhere.

288
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:28,496
Where could the Altair Bar have gone?

289
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:33,272
I have no idea.

290
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:45,513
I went to the liquor store.

291
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:51,360
Have you forgotten?

292
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:55,263
That place is a star.

293
00:53:57,434 --> 00:54:02,303
Of course! It comes from heaven.

294
00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:51,344
I was born here.

295
00:54:54,357 --> 00:54:56,257
I'm going to meet my father,

296
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:58,488
The Star Maker.

297
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:09,272
"You look awful".

298
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:12,332
"Drink this, you'll feel better".

299
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:26,489
Even with my eyes closed

300
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:29,350
I could feel how my body
began to shine again

301
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:35,455
I started talking febrile...

302
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:38,365
And he told me between laughs...

303
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:42,267
to take it calmly.

304
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,431
I told him I couldn't help it

305
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:47,409
because the things I wanted to tell him

306
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:50,470
are countless like the stars.

307
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,284
While traveling the realm of dreams

308
00:56:00,323 --> 00:56:04,350
I found a small planet, called "Phantasmagoria"

309
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:08,520
This has been a story from that planet.

310
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:11,423
Till next time!

311
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:36,258
ARTIFICIAL MOON

312
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,441
Dear Veena,

313
00:57:32,515 --> 00:57:35,382
How are you feeling?

314
00:57:36,553 --> 00:57:40,455
I hope you get better and become able
to go to the seaside again.

315
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:45,352
At the moment I'm writing this letter
from my moon laboratory.

316
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:52,292
I am afraid that I have nothing else to report
than the usual disappointment today.

317
00:57:53,336 --> 00:58:00,367
Veena, the experiment I set my hopes on to
lift of the artificial moon, failed too, I am afraid.

318
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:09,419
Last time it was too heavy and it wasn't able to rise.
This time, it was the opposite.

319
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:39,346
However, I won't give up...

320
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:45,311
...till the day that two moons can be seen
from the window in your room.

321
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:51,283
I believe you will most certainly get better Veena.
Hang in there.

322
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:54,523
Best wishes, good-bye.

323
00:58:55,431 --> 00:58:57,296
(Professor's name)

324
00:59:26,362 --> 00:59:29,263
Dear Veena,

325
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:35,303
Finally, 437 feet above sea level has
been reached in today's experiment.

326
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:44,506
I'm sure you will be able to watch the
success from the window in your room.

327
01:01:01,524 --> 01:01:05,392
Dear Veena...

328
01:01:12,402 --> 01:01:14,529
While traveling the realm of dreams

329
01:01:15,271 --> 01:01:18,240
I found a small planet, called "Phantasmagoria"

330
01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:22,276
This has been the short tale of that planet.

331
01:01:22,478 --> 01:01:24,275
Till next time!

332
01:01:42,498 --> 01:01:49,461
DIGITAL ZONE

333
01:01:55,478 --> 01:01:57,378
Everything that enters this zone

334
01:01:57,413 --> 01:02:00,314
turns into squares.

335
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:03,480
It's unknown why.

336
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,311
Dogs and horses

337
01:02:06,422 --> 01:02:08,287
walk squarely.

338
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:13,352
This is a rhinoceros turned into squares

339
01:02:16,532 --> 01:02:20,263
The snake's movements are also squared

340
01:02:27,276 --> 01:02:31,337
People call it "Digital Zone"

341
01:03:05,481 --> 01:03:07,472
Everything in this zone

342
01:03:07,517 --> 01:03:10,281
has a square form, like bricks.

343
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:13,515
This is the man that produces

344
01:03:14,257 --> 01:03:16,487
these bricks everyday.

345
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:21,387
On warm or cold days,

346
01:03:21,397 --> 01:03:24,423
Every day he works very hard.

347
01:03:43,352 --> 01:03:47,482
It seems he's about to finish.

348
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:05,474
He's finally finished.

349
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:09,342
It really took a lot...

350
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:12,439
to finish this work.

351
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:26,386
Once it was set on fire

352
01:04:26,495 --> 01:04:29,487
by a fire man.

353
01:04:39,508 --> 01:04:42,238
Once it was interrupted

354
01:04:42,278 --> 01:04:45,338
by a thoughtless walking building.

355
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:05,491
But his hard work ended today.

356
01:05:05,534 --> 01:05:08,469
He's so happy, tears roll down his cheeks.

357
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:50,368
But what will he do... after this?

358
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:06,485
Just as we thought...

359
01:06:07,229 --> 01:06:09,390
he comes again every day...

360
01:06:24,447 --> 01:06:26,472
While traveling through the realm of dreams.

361
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:30,451
[Discovered this little planet called "Phantasmagoria.]

362
01:06:30,519 --> 01:06:33,488
This has been a story from that planet.

363
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:36,484
Till next time!

364
01:06:56,312 --> 01:07:02,478
THE NIGHT OF THE PERSEIDS

365
01:07:05,287 --> 01:07:10,486
Shooting Star Hill

366
01:07:46,362 --> 01:07:53,268
Shadow Town

367
01:07:58,541 --> 01:08:03,478
Since the day after the big show in the sky,

368
01:08:04,346 --> 01:08:09,443
the stars started to act strangely.

369
01:08:26,502 --> 01:08:33,305
Watt Desert

370
01:08:38,314 --> 01:08:42,341
Stars sprouted from the desert

371
01:08:55,531 --> 01:09:01,231
Liquor Shop

372
01:09:08,277 --> 01:09:12,236
Fish danced in the water

373
01:09:23,526 --> 01:09:30,261
Dragon Hill Peak

374
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:43,343
There's no doubt something big will happen

375
01:09:49,251 --> 01:09:55,349
Santa Claus Town

376
01:10:13,409 --> 01:10:22,317
Skate Rink

377
01:10:38,267 --> 01:10:44,228
Limit Hotel

378
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:10,426
Star crash at Limit Hotel

379
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:41,320
While travelling the slumbers

380
01:11:41,363 --> 01:11:45,265
I discovered a little planet called "Phantasmagoria"

381
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:49,437
This has been the short tale of that planet.

382
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:52,206
Till next time!

383
01:12:11,293 --> 01:12:16,253
THE END OF THE JOURNEY

384
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:23,335
The last night of the long journey.

385
01:12:36,385 --> 01:12:42,290
Tomorrow I'll go back to my town,

386
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:58,500
Port of Tut.

387
01:13:18,293 --> 01:13:23,321
It was a wonderful journey.

388
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:34,467
I started last summer.

389
01:13:34,543 --> 01:13:37,341
I heard it would be cold in the north

390
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:50,358
so I packed more clothes...

391
01:13:50,359 --> 01:13:53,260
...and headed north through the desert.

392
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:01,403
It was my first visit

393
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:03,370
to the northern city.

394
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:14,416
It was the first time

395
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:16,384
that I tasted illegal whisky.

396
01:14:25,494 --> 01:14:27,359
In the Rainbow Valley

397
01:14:27,396 --> 01:14:30,297
I bought seven color paint...

398
01:14:39,441 --> 01:14:41,306
...and in the cosmic cafeteria

399
01:14:41,343 --> 01:14:43,368
I made a friend.

400
01:14:53,388 --> 01:14:58,451
I saw the aurora for the first time.
It will be the last one too, I am afraid.

401
01:15:19,414 --> 01:15:24,408
Tomorrow is the moonlight festival

402
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:39,428
The memories from this trip
will be something to always cherish.

403
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:25,372
While traveling the realm of dreams.

404
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:29,246
I found a little planet called "Phantasmagoria"

405
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:32,387
This has been a story from that planet.

406
01:16:33,355 --> 01:16:35,482
Goodbye.

407
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:08,382
Goodbye.
