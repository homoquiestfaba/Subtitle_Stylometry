Hi. Merry christmas!

I thought you were
going to the city.

16
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.207
Oh, I am. I just
had to swing by and grab some...

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:43.108
Red velvet cupcakes.

18
00:00:43.144 --> 00:00:45.010
Uh huh.

19
00:00:45.046 --> 00:00:46.111
Your sister and simon's

-Best in utah.
-You betcha.

-Thank you, daddy.

-you bet.

23
00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:51.650
I have a couple more
christmas errands to run

24
00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:53.519
and I'm off.

25
00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:58.323
Okay. Here you go, valerie.

26
00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:00.359
Peppermint hot cocoa.
Exactly 4 marshmallows.

27
00:01:00.394 --> 00:01:02.227
You remember everyone's order.

28
00:01:02.296 --> 00:01:04.129
But I ask you this,

29
00:01:04.165 --> 00:01:05.564
what if I suddenly wanted
2 marshmallows?

30
00:01:05.633 --> 00:01:07.132
Oh, I would advise
against that.

31
00:01:07.168 --> 00:01:09.668
No, 4, is the perfect number.
I should know.

32
00:01:09.703 --> 00:01:11.303
I've been managing this place
since I was 16.

33
00:01:11.338 --> 00:01:13.872
Since she was 6,
if we're being honest.

00:01:13.908 --> 00:01:16.008
Are you still going
to France this year?

35
00:01:16.043 --> 00:01:17.843
Oh, I'm sorry, was that a...

36
00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:19.711
No, no, no. That's okay.
Yes. I am going to France.

37
00:01:19.747 --> 00:01:21.146
And never coming back.

38
00:01:21.182 --> 00:01:23.549
Oh, daddy, stop it!

39
00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:26.485
I...It'll be a little bit
different this year.

40
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.253
I mean, uncle dave and I
used to go every year

41
00:01:28.322 --> 00:01:30.155
for the last decade,

42
00:01:30.191 --> 00:01:32.024
so, it feels like a tradition
at this point,

43
00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:34.593
but I'm still working out
the details.

44
00:01:34.662 --> 00:01:36.695
Well, here's to nothing
being the same without him.

45
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.831
Here's to that.

46
00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:39.898
-Have a good day.
-You too.

How's she doing really?

51
00:01:49.677 --> 00:01:51.043
We have had many
conversations

52
00:01:51.078 --> 00:01:52.578
about your uncle's theater.

53
00:01:52.613 --> 00:01:54.179
She's still thinking
of selling it?

54
00:01:54.215 --> 00:01:57.015
We have talked it through
so many times.

55
00:01:57.051 --> 00:01:58.717
She thinks it's for the best.

56
00:01:58.752 --> 00:02:01.920
Well, then, swift family rules.

57
00:02:01.956 --> 00:02:02.588
We're all here to support her.

58
00:02:02.623 --> 00:02:03.355

Jen: Meg, focus.

66
00:03:03.751 --> 00:03:06.151
We've already practiced it
this way.

67
00:03:06.187 --> 00:03:09.321
Right, jen. But it needs an
extra something.

68
00:03:09.356 --> 00:03:10.255
And if you keep changing it,
we'll never be ready.

your sister's buttons,

don't you?

71
00:03:29.843 --> 00:03:33.378
I think our dance number
needs something.

72
00:03:33.447 --> 00:03:35.847
Is it jet packs?

I know I have a good idea
but

82
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.403
it takes me a minute
to figure it out.

83
00:03:58.472 --> 00:04:00.005
When I opened this theater,

84
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.540
do you know
what I was gonna call it?

85
00:04:01.575 --> 00:04:03.709
The hazelwood show palace.

86
00:04:03.744 --> 00:04:06.812
I know, yikes, right?

87
00:04:06.847 --> 00:04:08.013
And your mom said
to name it something

88
00:04:08.048 --> 00:04:09.214
that had a little more meaning.

89
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.515
So you called it the madison?

90
00:04:10.551 --> 00:04:13.485
After grandpa madison.

91
00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.687
The point is,
your mom was right.

92
00:04:15.723 --> 00:04:16.655

for things like that.

I kind of think I'd have
managed to save it myself.

reflexes.

105

Hmm. Is that right?

of my assist.

-It's a tuba.

It's the basis of the brass.

You play tuba? Professionally?

112

Oh, no, no.
Not professionally.

-No.
-Ah.

How hard can it be?

for spare

00:08:17.631 --> 00:08:19.831
Okay.

180
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.266
-So, we have some shopping to
do.
-Yeah.

181
00:08:21.301 --> 00:08:23.068
And arriving from the kitchen,
a little nosh.

182
00:08:23.103 --> 00:08:24.336
Meg swift.

183
00:08:24.404 --> 00:08:25.804
Always a pleasure.

184
00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:27.973
And you, sir?

185
00:08:28.008 --> 00:08:30.141
Joe: Okay, be honest about
the hors d'oeuvres.

186
00:08:30.177 --> 00:08:31.977
Oh, joe. I don't think
you've met my sister meg.

187
00:08:32.012 --> 00:08:33.345
Meg, this is joe.
Our new general manager.

188
00:08:33.413 --> 00:08:34.513
Well, new-ish.

189
00:08:34.581 --> 00:08:35.747
Uh, we have met.

190
00:08:35.782 --> 00:08:37.482
He likes tubas,

191
00:08:37.518 --> 00:08:39.150
but he's a little clumsy.

192
00:08:39.186 --> 00:08:41.186
Oh. So you're
jennifer's sister, huh?

193
00:08:41.255 --> 00:08:42.687
Mm-hmm.

194
00:08:42.756 --> 00:08:44.289
Cat-like reflexes here.

195
00:08:44.324 --> 00:08:45.423
Tell me about those contests.

196
00:08:45.459 --> 00:08:47.526
Great salt, it's a

197
00:08:47.594 --> 00:08:49.928
local magazine, every year,
they pick 3 restaurants,

198
00:08:49.963 --> 00:08:52.597
to do this whole competition.

199
00:08:52.633 --> 00:08:54.499
They compete to throw
the best christmas party.

200
00:08:54.535 --> 00:08:55.867
-Yeah.
-I love it.
Who chooses the winner?

201
00:08:55.936 --> 00:08:58.036
The magazine. Everybody
gets a ton of publicity,

202
00:08:58.105 --> 00:09:00.772
and if you win, the magazine
will donate $25,000

203
00:09:00.807 --> 00:09:01.439
to the charity of your choice.

204
00:09:01.475 --> 00:09:03.308
Whoa.

205
00:09:03.343 --> 00:09:04.876
And for us,
it's big mountain food bank.

206
00:09:04.945 --> 00:09:06.611
I mean, it would mean
lines out the door.

207
00:09:06.647 --> 00:09:08.213
It takes us to a whole
next level.

208
00:09:08.282 --> 00:09:09.548
It'd be amazing.

209
00:09:09.616 --> 00:09:11.149
-Wow.
-Yeah.

210
00:09:11.184 --> 00:09:13.785
I'm so excited.

211
00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.855
And this is delicious.
Is that chervil?

212
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.723
You can taste the chervil.

213
00:09:18.792 --> 00:09:20.292
Oh, uh, professional
herb taster.

214
00:09:20.327 --> 00:09:21.226
Yeah, jen didn't tell you?

215
00:09:21.295 --> 00:09:23.995
Uh...

216
00:09:24.031 --> 00:09:27.732
Kidding. (laughs)
it's a joke. I was joking.

217
00:09:32.973 --> 00:09:35.006
Jen:
(laughs) I love it here.

218
00:09:35.042 --> 00:09:36.975
I know.

219
00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:38.243
I mean I love hazelwood
at christmas.

220
00:09:38.312 --> 00:09:39.411
-Yeah.
-But salt lake city.

221
00:09:39.479 --> 00:09:40.312
I know, it's amazing, right?

222
00:09:40.347 --> 00:09:42.681
It feels so good.

223
00:09:42.716 --> 00:09:43.481
Why don't you stick around
for a few more days?

224
00:09:43.517 --> 00:09:45.317
You know I'm offering you

225
00:09:45.352 --> 00:09:47.385
the world's most unreliable,
inflatable bed.

226
00:09:47.421 --> 00:09:48.720
(laughs)flat by morning.

227
00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:51.890
Both: Every time!

228
00:09:51.925 --> 00:09:54.092
So, are you still going
to France this year?

229
00:09:54.161 --> 00:09:56.528
Yeah. Without uncle dave.

230
00:09:56.563 --> 00:09:59.331
Oh...You two loved
traveling together.

231
00:09:59.366 --> 00:10:02.434
I loved hanging out with all
of his friends in paris.

232
00:10:02.502 --> 00:10:03.368
I loved that he spoke
terrible french.

233
00:10:03.403 --> 00:10:04.836
[laughs] bone-joor.

234
00:10:04.871 --> 00:10:06.771
Yeah, he'd be like, mare-si.

235
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.207
-[meg laughs]
-he was the best.

236
00:10:09.242 --> 00:10:10.508
But, I just think I gotta go.

237
00:10:10.544 --> 00:10:12.577
Yeah.

238
00:10:12.613 --> 00:10:15.113
I think I might need
to stay for awhile.

239
00:10:15.182 --> 00:10:17.949
Be honest. You have a secret
french boyfriend, don't you?

240
00:10:18.018 --> 00:10:21.286
How dare you bring up jean-louis
at a time like this.

241
00:10:21.355 --> 00:10:25.423
Have you ever felt like you
just needed the next thing?

242
00:10:25.459 --> 00:10:27.125
-All the time.
-Really?

243
00:10:27.194 --> 00:10:31.763
So what is the next thing?

244
00:10:31.798 --> 00:10:32.764
Uncle dave used to say that
big decisions take time,

245
00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:34.466
and I think for me, distance.

246
00:10:34.534 --> 00:10:36.101
Hmm.

247
00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:37.769
Like today, I got in the car,

248
00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:39.938
and I was driving here,
it just

249
00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:41.306
felt like anything was possible.

250
00:10:41.375 --> 00:10:43.208
Yeah.

251
00:10:43.243 --> 00:10:44.409
I mean, whatever's next for me,

252
00:10:44.444 --> 00:10:46.478
I don't think it's in hazelwood.

253
00:10:46.546 --> 00:10:47.912
Well, when you're ready
to figure it out, I'm here.

254
00:10:47.948 --> 00:10:50.281
I know you are.

255
00:10:50.317 --> 00:10:51.583
[meg giggles]

256
00:10:51.618 --> 00:10:52.984
look who I found.

257
00:10:53.053 --> 00:10:55.286
Hey. What are you doing here?

258
00:10:55.322 --> 00:10:57.222
Are you doing some
last minute christmas shopping?

259
00:10:57.257 --> 00:10:58.423
Oh, I usually like to take a
stroll
through the christmas market

260
00:10:58.458 --> 00:10:59.991
before the dinner rush.

261
00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.660
Yes. Magic.
Well, take a walk with us.

262
00:11:01.728 --> 00:11:03.228
Sure.

263
00:11:03.263 --> 00:11:05.230
Actually, simon and I
have to go pick up

264
00:11:05.265 --> 00:11:07.065
a secret christmas present
for somebody.

265
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.667
Are you pointing at me?

266
00:11:08.735 --> 00:11:10.001
-What? No.
-She's pointing at me.

267
00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:11.336
-Goodbye!
-Goodbye!

268
00:11:11.405 --> 00:11:13.672
-See you later!
-A christmas surprise!

269
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.607
Jen: What are christmas tapas?

270
00:11:15.642 --> 00:11:17.809
Um, impossible to describe.

271
00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:19.144
Okay.

272
00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:20.779
It's a rotating menu.

273
00:11:20.814 --> 00:11:21.813
So the only thing
you know for sure

274
00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:23.615
is that it's going to be
delicious.

275
00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:26.651
Oh, I think I'm going to have

276
00:11:26.687 --> 00:11:28.486
the rosemary potatoes,

277
00:11:28.522 --> 00:11:29.654
and the green beans
look really good too.

278
00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:31.122
-Christmas dinner.
-Both: Yes!

279
00:11:31.158 --> 00:11:32.624
Hi there.
What can I get for you?

280
00:11:32.659 --> 00:11:34.259
So hard to decide.

281
00:11:34.294 --> 00:11:34.859
Do you guys have
a sampler platter?

282
00:11:34.928 --> 00:11:37.862
Yes. Oh, hey.

283
00:11:37.931 --> 00:11:39.631
You're back. You were...
You were here yesterday.

284
00:11:39.666 --> 00:11:41.199
Yes, I was.

285
00:11:41.268 --> 00:11:43.535
And the day before.

286
00:11:43.603 --> 00:11:47.172
Yes. Correct.
Everything here
is so good looking.

287
00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:49.007
[jen giggles]
-wait, no, no.

288
00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:51.276
What I meant is that
everything here

289
00:11:51.311 --> 00:11:53.278
looks so good, and I'll have
the sampler platter.

290
00:11:53.313 --> 00:11:54.612
Uh, two of those?

291
00:11:54.648 --> 00:11:56.214
Yes, please. Thank you.

292
00:11:56.283 --> 00:11:57.716
Great.

293
00:11:57.784 --> 00:11:59.317
You are deeply smooth.

294
00:11:59.352 --> 00:12:01.219
I'm obvious.
It's my super power.

295
00:12:01.288 --> 00:12:01.720
[jen giggles]

296
00:12:03.724 --> 00:12:06.057
okay. So today I have combined

297
00:12:06.126 --> 00:12:08.326
the red potato
rosemary coquettes,

298
00:12:08.361 --> 00:12:10.061
and the turkey and gravy
on a biscuit

299
00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:11.996
and green beans
with a dash of spice.

300
00:12:12.032 --> 00:12:13.965
Thank you so much.

301
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.400
-Thank you. Tell your friends.
-Mm-hmm.

302
00:12:15.469 --> 00:12:17.802
And keep coming back.

303
00:12:17.838 --> 00:12:19.637
I'll see you again tomorrow.

304
00:12:19.673 --> 00:12:20.705
I am counting on that.

305
00:12:27.481 --> 00:12:29.214
Thanks for being my wing woman.

306
00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:31.015
Oh, I didn't do anything.

307
00:12:31.051 --> 00:12:32.884
I just stood there and giggled.

308
00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:34.018
Well, what could be more
helpful?

309
00:12:34.054 --> 00:12:34.319
[jen giggles]

310
00:12:46.433 --> 00:12:47.232
mm.

311
00:12:49.669 --> 00:12:50.668
Mm.

312
00:12:52.539 --> 00:12:54.272
Meg: I mean, why don't you
just stay longer?

313
00:12:54.341 --> 00:12:56.941
-Really?
-Yeah. Stay as long as you want.

314
00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:00.445
I mean, I would love it.

315
00:13:00.514 --> 00:13:02.413
I might have to borrow
some clothes.

316
00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:04.849
I love that you're even
pretending to ask.

317
00:13:04.885 --> 00:13:05.884
You're wearing one of
my sweaters right now.

318
00:13:05.919 --> 00:13:08.286
Shoot.

319
00:13:08.355 --> 00:13:13.091
(laughs) you know, I kind of
feel like I should stay too

320
00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:15.426
and help joe and the staff
plan the party.

321
00:13:15.462 --> 00:13:17.595
But I don't want to disappoint
mom and dad.

322
00:13:17.631 --> 00:13:18.563
Well, ulmer and sprig
feels like

323
00:13:18.598 --> 00:13:19.898
a pretty well-oiled machine.

324
00:13:19.933 --> 00:13:21.533
You deserve to enjoy it.

325
00:13:21.568 --> 00:13:23.802
What are you--

326
00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:25.537
-that's better.
-Really?

327
00:13:25.572 --> 00:13:26.070
Goes with the sweater.

328
00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:32.076
Alright, so then,
I'll help with the madison,

329
00:13:32.112 --> 00:13:34.112
and help with mom and dad,

330
00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:35.580
and you just stay
and take some space.

331
00:13:35.615 --> 00:13:36.414
I'm glad you're here.

332
00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:39.984
What's happening?

333
00:13:40.053 --> 00:13:41.452
It's so cute.

334
00:13:41.488 --> 00:13:42.587
-Is it?
-It's your new look.

335
00:13:42.622 --> 00:13:43.621
It's who you are now.

336
00:13:43.657 --> 00:13:46.090
[both laugh]

337
00:13:46.126 --> 00:13:47.926
-whoo! Alright, here.
-Yeah?

338
00:13:47.961 --> 00:13:49.961
Give these to mom

339
00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:51.162
and have her open them
one at a time.

340
00:13:51.231 --> 00:13:53.965
Oh, that's a good idea.
That's so sweet.

341
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.968
Also, go to the antique booth
at the christmas market

342
00:13:57.003 --> 00:13:58.336
ôcause they might have some
more of
those christmas village pieces.

343
00:13:58.405 --> 00:14:00.572
-Oh, I will.
-Okay.

344
00:14:00.607 --> 00:14:03.241
Simon, drive safely. I love
you guys.

345
00:14:03.276 --> 00:14:04.242
-Love you!
-Love you, too.

346
00:14:04.277 --> 00:14:04.909
Seatbelts.

347
00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:10.181
Go, simon! Whoo-hoo!

348
00:14:12.752 --> 00:14:13.751
(sighs)

349
00:14:19.159 --> 00:14:20.992
that's all that I have.

350
00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:22.160
But I can get you
something else.

351
00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:24.028
That's a lot of mistletoe.

352
00:14:24.097 --> 00:14:24.829
Hey. I thought you
were going back to...

353
00:14:24.865 --> 00:14:27.465
Yeah. Change of plans.

354
00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:28.833
Gonna stick around for another
couple of days. What is this?

00:14:28.869 --> 00:14:31.369
Uh, just uh, buying some holly.
For the party.

356
00:14:31.438 --> 00:14:35.540
Holly has red berries.
This is mistletoe.

357
00:14:35.609 --> 00:14:38.443
So unless this the theme of your
christmas party is kissing,

358
00:14:38.478 --> 00:14:39.644
which, by the way,
sounds like a very fun party.

359
00:14:39.679 --> 00:14:41.045
No, no, no.

360
00:14:41.114 --> 00:14:42.881
People would love that.

361
00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:45.283
Yeah, no, I honestly thought
this was uh...

362
00:14:45.318 --> 00:14:47.118
-Oh, no, honestly.
-Holly.

363
00:14:47.153 --> 00:14:48.686
Honest. Honest mistake.

364
00:14:48.722 --> 00:14:53.157
Okay, um... Uh, pine garland.

365
00:14:53.193 --> 00:14:54.192
I never really got
the whole mistletoe thing.

366
00:14:54.227 --> 00:14:57.662
When I was in high school,

367
00:14:57.697 --> 00:14:59.130
I had a huge crush
on this guy named justin leach.

368
00:14:59.165 --> 00:15:00.899
Oh, I went to the christmas
party,

369
00:15:00.967 --> 00:15:03.368
and I stood underneath
the mistletoe for hours.

370
00:15:03.403 --> 00:15:04.469
-Full size. Thank you.
-Waiting.

371
00:15:04.504 --> 00:15:07.038
He's married now. Not to me.

372
00:15:07.073 --> 00:15:09.207
To this woman who's like,
amazing.

373
00:15:09.242 --> 00:15:10.041
-Got it.
-You want me to carry that?

374
00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:12.043
You got any more?

375
00:15:12.078 --> 00:15:13.411
I can carry it.
Here. I can carry it.

376
00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.014
So, this party.
Tell me the plan.

377
00:15:16.049 --> 00:15:18.483
Well, I've been working really
hard to get us nominated.

378
00:15:18.518 --> 00:15:20.585
I put aside some money
for a budget.

379
00:15:20.654 --> 00:15:23.154
Obviously, the food is ready,
uh the decorations, and...

380
00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:24.522
Photo booth.

381
00:15:24.557 --> 00:15:26.357
The photo booth?

382
00:15:26.393 --> 00:15:27.358
You're not gonna have a photo
booth?

383
00:15:27.394 --> 00:15:30.528
I hadn't...Considered uh...

384
00:15:30.563 --> 00:15:32.697
Photo booths are kind of hokey.

385
00:15:32.732 --> 00:15:34.332
No. Especially not a christmas
one.

386
00:15:34.367 --> 00:15:35.667
Do you throw a lot
of christmas parties?

387
00:15:35.702 --> 00:15:37.902
Sometimes. Yeah.

388
00:15:37.938 --> 00:15:40.838
Well, or engagement parties.
Bridal showers. I'm--

-What? No.
-I'm sorry. I'm just...

391
00:15:45.545 --> 00:15:47.412
I've always thought of myself
as cheerfully helpful.

392
00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:48.713
Although I guess
that's what you'd think

393
00:15:48.748 --> 00:15:49.681
if you were the town busybody.

394
00:15:49.716 --> 00:15:51.182
You know what?

395
00:15:51.217 --> 00:15:52.750
The photo booth is a good idea.

396
00:15:52.786 --> 00:15:55.453
-Right?
-Yeah.

00:15:55.522 --> 00:15:56.587

about those ideas.

of simplicity...

too much and fail,

509
00:20:22.255 --> 00:20:23.788
So, I'd been volunteering here

510
00:20:23.823 --> 00:20:25.890
for a long time,
and then your sister and her

511
00:20:25.925 --> 00:20:27.592
staff started showing up
once a week,

512
00:20:27.627 --> 00:20:28.392
and just one big, fun group.

513
00:20:28.428 --> 00:20:30.795
Hmm.

514
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:32.230
I got to know them, and one
thing led to another,

515
00:20:32.265 --> 00:20:35.299
and uh,
then I asked your sister

516
00:20:35.335 --> 00:20:37.501
if she needed someone
to run the place.

517
00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:38.469
Out of the blue you just asked
to run a restaurant?

518
00:20:38.504 --> 00:20:40.171
Well, I have a resume.

519
00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.306
It's kind of always
been my thing, you know.

520
00:20:42.342 --> 00:20:44.742
You know, bars, restaurants,
you name it,

521
00:20:44.777 --> 00:20:46.410
always make the best jobs.

522
00:20:46.446 --> 00:20:48.145
And I knew
working for your sister

523
00:20:48.181 --> 00:20:49.480
would let me carve out time
to volunteer here.

524
00:20:49.515 --> 00:20:51.449
Mm.

525
00:20:51.484 --> 00:20:53.017

need right now.

530
00:21:05.198 --> 00:21:07.832
[bells jingle]
-[meg laughs]

531
00:21:07.867 --> 00:21:10.534
you have to be jennifer's
sister.
I'm maryanne.

532
00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:12.169
Meg. Nice to meet you.

533
00:21:12.205 --> 00:21:14.472
So, we were chosen

534
00:21:14.507 --> 00:21:15.373
for that contest
I was telling you about.

535
00:21:15.441 --> 00:21:17.441
Oh, wow!

536
00:21:17.477 --> 00:21:19.277
And if we win, it's $25,000

537
00:21:19.312 --> 00:21:20.444
to the charity
of our choice.

538
00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.179
I know you have plans to build.

539
00:21:22.215 --> 00:21:24.949
Ok, I'm sorry.
I don't mean to cry.

540
00:21:24.984 --> 00:21:27.652
I...Any act of kindness, and
here come the waterworks.

541
00:21:27.687 --> 00:21:29.153
No, it's good. Let it out.
Feel the feelings.

542
00:21:29.188 --> 00:21:31.022
Well, wait. We haven't won yet.

543
00:21:31.057 --> 00:21:32.690
I know,
but it would mean so much.

544
00:21:32.725 --> 00:21:34.625
See, right now,

545
00:21:34.661 --> 00:21:37.028
we pre-pack
boxes of food for people.

546
00:21:37.063 --> 00:21:39.697
But we want it to be
more like a grocery store.

547
00:21:39.732 --> 00:21:41.365
Where people can come in
and choose.

548
00:21:41.401 --> 00:21:43.534
Oh, I'd love that.

549
00:21:43.569 --> 00:21:45.303
There are these places that
are popping up everywhere.

550
00:21:45.338 --> 00:21:46.637
There's one in santa barbara.

551
00:21:46.673 --> 00:21:48.205
One in nashville.

552
00:21:48.241 --> 00:21:49.640
They call it the store,
but I call it

553
00:22:00.753 --> 00:22:03.187
already needs
some adjustments, of course.

554
00:22:03.222 --> 00:22:06.424
I figure we could put
produce here,

555
00:22:06.492 --> 00:22:08.859
and the refrigerator section
here.
I mean,

556
00:22:08.895 --> 00:22:11.896
it's big enough, right?

557
00:22:11.931 --> 00:22:14.732
Wow, this would be so amazing.

558
00:22:14.767 --> 00:22:16.567
Well, hopefully the prize
money will allow for that.

559
00:22:16.602 --> 00:22:18.703
Well, with the
$25,000 seed money,

560
00:22:18.738 --> 00:22:21.005
I mean, we would qualify
for a ton of grants,

561
00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:23.341
and nonprofit matching funds.

562
00:22:23.376 --> 00:22:26.510
It'd be a lot of work,
but it'd be so worth it.

563
00:22:26.546 --> 00:22:29.113
We will work so hard
to make this happen for you.

564
00:22:29.182 --> 00:22:29.413
Maryanne: Oh, thank you.

565
00:22:33.119 --> 00:22:34.618
But if we get the word out
to enough people,

566
00:22:34.687 --> 00:22:36.587
if we get the right publicity.

567
00:22:36.622 --> 00:22:38.422
Yeah, we can't get ahead
of ourselves.

568
00:22:38.458 --> 00:22:40.591
We're a small staff, meg,
with limited resources.

569
00:22:40.626 --> 00:22:42.026
Well, but you have me.

570
00:22:42.061 --> 00:22:43.294
For how long?

571
00:22:43.363 --> 00:22:44.428
Hey, joe. You got a minute?

572
00:22:52.271 --> 00:22:53.137
[phone rings]

573
00:22:53.206 --> 00:22:55.139
meg?

574
00:22:55.208 --> 00:22:56.907
Does my name not come up
when I call?

575
00:22:56.943 --> 00:22:58.876
I hope I'm listed in your phone.

576
00:22:58.911 --> 00:23:00.644
Very funny. Alright.
How are things there?

577
00:23:00.713 --> 00:23:02.913
-Honestly, it's amazing.
-Yeah?

578
00:23:02.949 --> 00:23:05.716
I love this city!

579
00:23:05.752 --> 00:23:07.318
And joe showed me
the food bank,

580
00:23:07.387 --> 00:23:09.787
and I'm really enjoying myself.

581
00:23:09.822 --> 00:23:11.822
Oh, maryanne's a real
ball of fire, isn't she?

582
00:23:11.891 --> 00:23:14.325
Oh, she's great! I love her.

583
00:23:14.394 --> 00:23:18.129
And I want to help your staff
throw a blow-out party.

584
00:23:18.164 --> 00:23:19.730
So, I was thinking,
what if I didn't

585
00:23:19.766 --> 00:23:21.632
go back to hazelwood?

586
00:23:21.667 --> 00:23:24.402
I think that's really smart.

587
00:23:24.437 --> 00:23:26.070
You don't think mom and dad
are gonna be upset

588
00:23:26.105 --> 00:23:28.439
if I stay here
for a couple more days?

589
00:23:28.474 --> 00:23:29.974
I think they'd be glad
you're trying something new.

590
00:23:30.009 --> 00:23:35.279
Oh, sister swap. I love this!

591
00:23:35.314 --> 00:23:36.981
I do too. Alright,
I'm gonna tell joe

592
00:23:37.016 --> 00:23:38.582
that you're helping out, okay?

593
00:23:38.618 --> 00:23:40.751
Oh, no, no. Let me.
I can handle it.

594
00:23:40.787 --> 00:23:43.954
Okay, alright. Well, um...

595
00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:45.156
I love you. Call me
if anything comes up, okay?

596
00:23:45.191 --> 00:23:46.023
I promise I will.

597
00:23:46.092 --> 00:23:47.158
I love you, too.

598
00:23:47.193 --> 00:23:49.160
Bye.

599
00:23:49.195 --> 00:23:49.593
Also, I'm never giving back
this coat.

600
00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.200
I've just never seen you
take a night off before.

601
00:23:56.269 --> 00:23:57.635
Everything okay?

602
00:23:57.670 --> 00:23:59.203
Yeah. I...I have a date.

603
00:23:59.272 --> 00:24:01.338
-But if you need me...
-No, no, no.

604
00:24:01.374 --> 00:24:05.042
No! I'm happy for you.
Take a chance, man.

605
00:24:05.111 --> 00:24:06.110
Thank you.

606
00:24:06.145 --> 00:24:07.278
Good luck.

607
00:24:07.313 --> 00:24:08.779
Alex: Thank you.

608
00:24:08.815 --> 00:24:10.714
-Hey there.
-Hey.

609
00:24:10.783 --> 00:24:11.982
Is that the rsvp list
for the party?

610
00:24:12.018 --> 00:24:13.818
Uh, yeah, slow going so far,

611
00:24:13.853 --> 00:24:16.654
but uh, we'll catch up.

612
00:24:16.689 --> 00:24:18.355
We should get a mailing list
and send out an email blast.

613
00:24:18.391 --> 00:24:20.357
Also, bear with me,

614
00:24:20.393 --> 00:24:22.193
what if, in terms
of the decorations,

615
00:24:22.228 --> 00:24:24.862
what if we go big?

616
00:24:24.897 --> 00:24:25.863
I'm sorry,
am I missing something here?

617
00:24:25.898 --> 00:24:27.465
Do you work here now?

618
00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:29.834
Oh, uh, sort of.

619
00:24:29.869 --> 00:24:32.002
I had a little chat
with jennifer,

620
00:24:32.038 --> 00:24:33.838
and I'm gonna be helping out

621
00:24:33.873 --> 00:24:35.005
with the planning of the party.

622
00:24:35.041 --> 00:24:37.374
Well, uh...

623
00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:43.080
I don't want to end up with
20-feet of mistletoe, so...

624
00:24:43.149 --> 00:24:44.815
Why don't we meet
in the morning? Go shopping.

625
00:24:44.851 --> 00:24:45.349
-Perfect!
-Perfect!

626
00:24:49.555 --> 00:24:50.354
Ow.

627
00:24:59.031 --> 00:25:01.899
-Hey.
-Hi.

628
00:25:01.934 --> 00:25:02.933
-You wanted to meet me here?
-Yes. Come on in.

629
00:25:02.969 --> 00:25:03.634
Alright.

630
00:25:05.238 --> 00:25:08.806
Oh...Wow!

631
00:25:08.875 --> 00:25:11.242
Oh, my sister told me
about this installation

632
00:25:11.277 --> 00:25:13.310
but I didn't know
it would be so beautiful.

633
00:25:13.379 --> 00:25:16.747
Yeah. People come from all over
every year to see this.

634
00:25:16.782 --> 00:25:18.716
I think we should get an artist

635
00:25:18.751 --> 00:25:20.251
to do an installation
for the party.

636
00:25:20.286 --> 00:25:21.418
Yeah, meg, I...

637
00:25:21.454 --> 00:25:23.821
No, come on.

638
00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:24.955
You said people come
from all over the place.

639
00:25:24.991 --> 00:25:27.157
They'll flock to our party.

640
00:25:27.226 --> 00:25:29.660
Throw in a couple of
activities. Come on.

641
00:25:29.729 --> 00:25:31.462
Yeah, but after yesterday,
I'm a little worried

642
00:25:31.497 --> 00:25:34.798
about what you mean
by activities?

643
00:25:34.834 --> 00:25:37.434
A good christmas party
needs things to do.

644
00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:39.336
-Take weddings. For example.
-Mm-hmm.

645
00:25:39.405 --> 00:25:40.938
They're fun because you get
to watch the groom dance

646
00:25:40.973 --> 00:25:43.807
with his mom.

647
00:25:43.843 --> 00:25:44.808
Someone throws something
you can catch.

648
00:25:44.844 --> 00:25:46.277
Cake in the face!

649
00:25:46.312 --> 00:25:47.745
Yeah, but for a christmas
party--

650
00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.748
it's the same thing.

651
00:25:50.783 --> 00:25:52.182
A party where you stand around
all
day in your formal clothes,

652
00:25:52.251 --> 00:25:55.085
that's a party you leave.

653
00:25:55.121 --> 00:25:57.354
That's a middle school dance.

654
00:25:57.423 --> 00:25:58.322
Did you go
to a middle school dance?

655
00:26:00.326 --> 00:26:01.692
Were you not fun?

656
00:26:01.761 --> 00:26:03.627
I was fun.

657
00:26:03.663 --> 00:26:06.864
But my family
kept christmas simple.

658
00:26:06.933 --> 00:26:08.666
You know, my parents
liked to travel a lot,

659
00:26:08.701 --> 00:26:11.669
and I...I honestly liked to
volunteer over the holidays.

660
00:26:11.704 --> 00:26:13.604
Oh, yeah. My sister told me
about the holiday traditions

661
00:26:13.639 --> 00:26:15.673
of the wait staff.

662
00:26:15.708 --> 00:26:16.941
And no matter what,
I always make sure

663
00:26:16.976 --> 00:26:18.475
that it was for everybody.

664
00:26:18.511 --> 00:26:20.511
Because we have to build

665
00:26:20.546 --> 00:26:22.513
the community
that we want, right?

666
00:26:22.548 --> 00:26:23.981
That's what our party
should be about.

667
00:26:24.016 --> 00:26:26.450
It should be about community.

668
00:26:26.485 --> 00:26:29.853
You know, a big celebration,
you know.

669
00:26:29.889 --> 00:26:31.522
-Get 'em dancing.
-Get 'em dancing, huh?

670
00:26:31.557 --> 00:26:33.190
-Oh.
-Yes.

671
00:26:33.225 --> 00:26:34.391
Oh, dancing, huh?

672
00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:36.694
Whoo!

673
00:26:36.729 --> 00:26:37.861
Yeah, well, we don't have much
time before the lunch rush,

674
00:26:37.897 --> 00:26:39.897
and this is a little more

675
00:26:39.966 --> 00:26:42.066
elaborate than the holly wreaths
that I was thinking.

676
00:26:42.134 --> 00:26:44.568
I'll get a quote for
the poinsettias.

677
00:26:44.637 --> 00:26:46.136
That guy looks like
he might know.

678
00:26:46.172 --> 00:26:46.804
Yeah, wait, but uh...

679
00:26:56.549 --> 00:26:58.682
Hey, frank.
You have a good lunch today?

680
00:26:58.718 --> 00:27:00.918
As it always is.
A good routine is the key

681
00:27:00.987 --> 00:27:02.720
to a healthy life. And...

682
00:27:02.755 --> 00:27:05.022
Sometimes you get free cookies.

683
00:27:05.057 --> 00:27:07.891
(laughs) do you have any
holiday travel coming up?

684
00:27:07.927 --> 00:27:13.831
Um...No. Not so much anymore.

685
00:27:13.866 --> 00:27:16.367
I have a daughter,
but we celebrate separately.

686
00:27:16.402 --> 00:27:18.669
Oh.

687
00:27:18.704 --> 00:27:21.238
Alex, how'd the date go?

688
00:27:21.273 --> 00:27:23.240
Yes, I was curious
about this as well.

689
00:27:23.275 --> 00:27:24.742
Was it stressful trying to
figure out what to wear?

690
00:27:24.777 --> 00:27:26.877
-I always find that part
stressful.
-Where'd you go?

691
00:27:26.912 --> 00:27:31.682
-It was fun. And he's great.
-Oh.

692
00:27:31.717 --> 00:27:34.385
And I invited him to our
volunteer shift tomorrow.

693
00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:36.120
So I'm gonna need you
to play it cool, mom and dad.

694
00:27:36.188 --> 00:27:38.188
Frank: Y'all volunteer?

695
00:27:38.224 --> 00:27:40.858
Together? Where?

696
00:27:40.893 --> 00:27:42.292
The big mountain food bank.

697
00:27:42.361 --> 00:27:44.561
We take a shift once a week.

698
00:27:44.597 --> 00:27:46.130
You should come and join us
sometime, frank.

699
00:27:46.198 --> 00:27:47.598
-I'd love to.
-Great.

700
00:27:47.633 --> 00:27:48.532
Tomorrow morning. 8am.

701
00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:53.103
And you, mister.

702
00:27:53.139 --> 00:27:53.437
We have a date with some
wreaths and trees.

703
00:27:53.472 --> 00:27:54.038
Ah.

704
00:27:56.409 --> 00:27:58.308
Joe: Hey, look at this beauty.

705
00:27:58.377 --> 00:28:00.310
Okay. So in a fantasy world,

706
00:28:00.379 --> 00:28:02.312
in addition
to the poinsettias,

707
00:28:02.381 --> 00:28:04.381
what if we have one
really big tree,

708
00:28:04.417 --> 00:28:06.717
like enormous, tall, and fat.

709
00:28:06.752 --> 00:28:08.819
Where would the people stand?

710
00:28:08.888 --> 00:28:11.955
Have you seen the rsvp list?
We've got 18 people coming.

711
00:28:11.991 --> 00:28:14.124
I think we'll be able
to make room.

712
00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.794
But we have one big tree that
we can all decorate, right?

713
00:28:16.829 --> 00:28:18.562
Not as a kid.

714
00:28:18.597 --> 00:28:20.397
I always wanted
an enormous tree,

715
00:28:20.433 --> 00:28:21.799
but my parents
wouldn't let me get one,

716
00:28:21.834 --> 00:28:23.067
because they were afraid
it would take up

717
00:28:23.102 --> 00:28:23.934
too much space
in the living room.

718
00:28:23.969 --> 00:28:26.136
-Me too.
-Really?

719
00:28:26.172 --> 00:28:28.505
Yeah. But, I would always say

720
00:28:28.574 --> 00:28:30.174
we can cut the bottom out

721
00:28:30.242 --> 00:28:31.675
and we can make

722
00:28:31.744 --> 00:28:32.943
a wreath.

723
00:28:32.978 --> 00:28:34.311
Out of the scraps.

724
00:28:34.346 --> 00:28:35.779
Both: Great minds.

725
00:28:35.815 --> 00:28:37.081
[meg laughs]

726
00:28:37.116 --> 00:28:38.649
so this is what small town

727
00:28:38.684 --> 00:28:42.352
christmas traditions are.

728
00:28:42.421 --> 00:28:45.289
You and some ski patrol dude
making wreaths together.

729
00:28:45.324 --> 00:28:46.590
Well, I'm from
a very small town,

730
00:28:46.625 --> 00:28:48.358
so there's one
ski patrol dude,

731
00:28:48.427 --> 00:28:50.160
and he's older than my dad.

732
00:28:50.196 --> 00:28:51.495
-[joe laughs]
-what about you?

733
00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:53.130
You bring a lot of women

734
00:28:53.165 --> 00:28:54.865
to the old wreath-making table?

735
00:28:54.934 --> 00:28:56.800
Because getting your hands
full of sap

736
00:28:56.836 --> 00:28:59.269
and making something with
questionable
artistic taste

737
00:28:59.305 --> 00:29:01.271
is a solid date.

738
00:29:01.307 --> 00:29:03.607
Well, you can't beat
the pine scented air.

739
00:29:03.642 --> 00:29:04.942
[cell phone buzzes]

740
00:29:07.813 --> 00:29:09.546
oh, uh...
I gotta take this.

741
00:29:09.615 --> 00:29:11.048
Yeah, sure. Go take that.

742
00:29:11.117 --> 00:29:13.684
We're about done here.

743
00:29:13.719 --> 00:29:14.685
We can hang these wreaths up
at the restaurant.

744
00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.720
It'll be beautiful.

745
00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:18.822
We can put it up on the wall,
and we can...Okay.

746
00:29:18.858 --> 00:29:19.523
Joe: Hello?

747
00:29:21.861 --> 00:29:24.962
Hi. Psst. Excuse me.

748
00:29:24.997 --> 00:29:27.464
Could you help me get like

749
00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:30.467
a big centerpiece type tree,
like a

750
00:29:30.503 --> 00:29:33.003
double wide,
but it's kind of a surprise.

751
00:29:33.038 --> 00:29:35.539
No. No, it's no problem.

752
00:29:35.574 --> 00:29:38.308
Okay. Thank you.
Merry christmas.

753
00:29:38.344 --> 00:29:42.045
Sir, um,
I'm looking for a tree

754
00:29:42.081 --> 00:29:44.148
that's kind of uh,
double wide.

755
00:29:44.183 --> 00:29:45.549
-Like this one?
-Yes.

756
00:29:45.584 --> 00:29:46.316
Okay.

757
00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:49.153
And uh...It's a, it's a
surprise. So shh. Okay.

758
00:29:57.263 --> 00:29:57.995
[facetime rings on cell phone]

759
00:30:05.571 --> 00:30:07.671
hey, meg!

760
00:30:07.706 --> 00:30:09.439
Oh, hi, everybody.
I miss you!

761
00:30:09.508 --> 00:30:10.874
Are you decorating the tree?

762
00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:13.210
We are! How are you?

763
00:30:13.245 --> 00:30:14.077
Um...

764
00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:17.247
Wait right there.

765
00:30:20.286 --> 00:30:23.287
Then all of a sudden,
it just hit me like a wave.

766
00:30:23.355 --> 00:30:24.888
And as much as I wanted
to be there

767
00:30:24.924 --> 00:30:26.456
for their big night
at the theater,

768
00:30:26.525 --> 00:30:29.393
I suddenly didn't.
I wanted to be here.

769
00:30:29.428 --> 00:30:31.895
And you feel okay about it?

770
00:30:31.931 --> 00:30:33.964
Well, like always,
jen listened.

771
00:30:34.033 --> 00:30:35.933
Mm-hmm.

772
00:30:35.968 --> 00:30:37.601
And she let me
feel my feelings.

773
00:30:37.636 --> 00:30:40.904
And then she had precisely
the right thing to say.

774
00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:42.039
Sisters are amazing.

775
00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:45.876
Sisters are amazing.
[meg chuckles]

776
00:30:45.911 --> 00:30:47.444
thank you guys once again

777
00:30:47.479 --> 00:30:49.613
for volunteering
tomorrow morning.

778
00:30:49.648 --> 00:30:50.948
Hey, we wouldn't miss it.

779
00:30:50.983 --> 00:30:53.250
Oh, uh, meg.

780
00:30:53.285 --> 00:30:56.086
I still need a photo for the
email blast invitation.

781
00:30:56.121 --> 00:30:57.921
Yes. I'm gonna get that for
you tomorrow, I promise.

782
00:30:57.957 --> 00:30:58.922
Wow. The party's in 7 days.

783
00:30:58.958 --> 00:31:00.724
No.

784
00:31:00.759 --> 00:31:01.725
They don't give us
a lot of time

785
00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:02.893
to plan this thing, do they?

786
00:31:02.928 --> 00:31:04.661
Well, that's the fun part.

787
00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:05.462
-Good night, guys.
-Bye.

788
00:31:05.497 --> 00:31:08.098
Good night.

789
00:31:08.133 --> 00:31:10.334
Hey, I had fun playing christmas
elf with you today.

790
00:31:10.402 --> 00:31:11.401
Maybe tomorrow
we can go down...

791
00:31:11.437 --> 00:31:13.070
-Early morning.
-Oh.

792
00:31:13.105 --> 00:31:15.305
Yeah, I told maryanne
I would go by

793
00:31:15.341 --> 00:31:17.474
and pick up some supplies
before we show up. No.

794
00:31:17.509 --> 00:31:19.109
And it's on the way,
so, yeah.

795
00:31:19.144 --> 00:31:20.077
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

796
00:31:20.112 --> 00:31:22.179
Okay.

797
00:31:22.248 --> 00:31:23.847
Good night, joe.

798
00:31:23.916 --> 00:31:24.848
Good night, meg.

799
00:31:29.922 --> 00:31:31.321
Good night, joe.

800
00:31:31.357 --> 00:31:33.257
Would you stop it.

801
00:31:33.292 --> 00:31:35.158
[victoria laughs]
I don't want to be rude.

802
00:31:35.194 --> 00:31:36.760
It's polite to say
good night to someone.

803
00:31:36.795 --> 00:31:38.462
I don't...
I want to be professional.

804
00:31:38.497 --> 00:31:39.329
-Yeah.
-That's what you do, say
goodnight

805
00:31:39.365 --> 00:31:40.797
my, my person that I work with.

806
00:31:40.833 --> 00:31:41.965
That's what you say!

807
00:31:42.001 --> 00:31:43.333
Of course, you do.

808
00:31:52.044 --> 00:31:53.110
All these boxes
have stuff in them.

809
00:31:56.582 --> 00:31:59.783
Hey, alex. How you doing?

810
00:31:59.818 --> 00:32:01.385
Christmas tapas.
How are you?

811
00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:03.086
Good to see you.

812
00:32:03.122 --> 00:32:04.721
-You too!
-Joe. Welcome aboard.

813
00:32:04.757 --> 00:32:05.756
-Thanks.
-Oh, uh...

814
00:32:05.791 --> 00:32:07.624
We brought muffins.

815
00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:10.661
Well, look at this crew.

816
00:32:10.729 --> 00:32:11.828
There's a lot more
than normal, right?

817
00:32:11.897 --> 00:32:13.830
Yes. This is martin.

818
00:32:13.899 --> 00:32:15.332
-Hi!
-And frank.

819
00:32:15.401 --> 00:32:17.267
Hey!

820
00:32:17.303 --> 00:32:19.336
Oh, well, thank you all
for being here.

821
00:32:19.405 --> 00:32:21.438
There's so much to do, and I
really appreciate the help.

822
00:32:21.473 --> 00:32:25.108
-Put us to work.
-Here. Corn.

823
00:32:25.144 --> 00:32:27.077
No one can find the red
food coloring.

824
00:32:27.112 --> 00:32:29.012
But we found
the green food coloring.

825
00:32:29.081 --> 00:32:30.314
So we figured, oh,
that'd be fine, right?

826
00:32:30.349 --> 00:32:32.082
-It wasn't?
-No, it was not.

827
00:32:32.117 --> 00:32:34.651
But only because I had
swapped sugar for salt.

828
00:32:34.687 --> 00:32:36.153
So it was green,

829
00:32:36.188 --> 00:32:38.689
and it was salty.

830
00:32:38.757 --> 00:32:41.792
Henceforth known as the great
grinch cake christmas.

831
00:32:41.827 --> 00:32:43.660
(laughs) you tell a good story.

832
00:32:43.696 --> 00:32:45.595
My nia's like that.

833
00:32:45.631 --> 00:32:47.597
-Is that your daughter?
-Yeah.

834
00:32:47.633 --> 00:32:49.366
So artistic.
Such a way with words. Just...

835
00:32:49.435 --> 00:32:53.036
-...Capable. Smart. But uh...
-Hmm.

836
00:32:53.105 --> 00:32:56.440
I was too strict.
I know that now.

837
00:32:56.475 --> 00:32:59.843
I worry too much.

838
00:32:59.878 --> 00:33:02.646
I wanted to protect her so
badly,

839
00:33:02.681 --> 00:33:05.315
but she needed
to spread her wings, so...

840
00:33:05.351 --> 00:33:06.683
If I had it to do over, I'd...

841
00:33:06.719 --> 00:33:08.986
You know, I'm rambling.

842
00:33:13.892 --> 00:33:15.892
Is that why you don't celebrate
christmas with her?

843
00:33:15.961 --> 00:33:18.495
It's not just that.

844
00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:22.232
We're both pretty stubborn.

845
00:33:22.301 --> 00:33:24.001
I got another box here.
It's ready to go.

846
00:33:30.976 --> 00:33:33.410
People just...
Tell you things, huh?

847
00:33:33.479 --> 00:33:36.246
Yeah. I have that kind of face.

848
00:33:36.315 --> 00:33:38.081
It means I get to hear
some great stories.

849
00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:38.815
Hmm.

850
00:33:40.753 --> 00:33:45.589
What if we united them?

851
00:33:45.657 --> 00:33:48.525
Bring frank's daughter into
the cafñ. 01:33:55:15
--:--:--:-- I don't know .

852
00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:51.228
I mean, it's very kind,

853
00:33:51.263 --> 00:33:53.663
but that feels like
it be a tiny step too far.

854
00:33:53.699 --> 00:33:55.699
Yeah. Maybe you're right.

855
00:33:55.734 --> 00:33:58.268
Hey, we're about done here.

856
00:33:58.337 --> 00:34:00.837
I've gotta run one errand
before the lunch rush.

857
00:34:00.873 --> 00:34:01.838
Have you done your
christmas shopping yet?

858
00:34:07.679 --> 00:34:10.247
Oh! This is so perfect.

859
00:34:10.282 --> 00:34:11.915
It is.

860
00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:13.717
Here you go.
Thank you so much.

861
00:34:13.752 --> 00:34:15.685
-Oh, thanks. Merry christmas!
-Merry christmas.

862
00:34:15.721 --> 00:34:18.355
We're adding to my uncle dave's
christmas village

863
00:34:18.390 --> 00:34:20.290
-as a present for my mom.
-Ah.

864
00:34:20.359 --> 00:34:21.958
It's also a good way
for her to remember him.

865
00:34:22.027 --> 00:34:23.126
You're heading home
tonight, right,

866
00:34:23.195 --> 00:34:24.628
uh, for the theater opening?

867
00:34:24.696 --> 00:34:27.197
Actually, no.
No, and jennifer

868
00:34:27.232 --> 00:34:28.632
was really cool about me
needing to stay here.

869
00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:30.967
I just can't imagine

870
00:34:31.036 --> 00:34:32.269
going back to the theater
without
uncle dave, you know.

871
00:34:32.304 --> 00:34:33.970
Yeah.

872
00:34:34.039 --> 00:34:36.873
Telling stories
with sound effects.

873
00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:38.575
[joe chuckles] 01:34:45:00
--:--:--:--
-Popping his popcorn. -Yeah.

874
00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:40.977
Also, it kind of feels like

875
00:34:41.046 --> 00:34:43.280
there's something here
that I need to learn.

876
00:34:43.315 --> 00:34:45.048
When I first started here,

877
00:34:45.084 --> 00:34:47.617
I felt I was supposed
to be here.

878
00:34:47.653 --> 00:34:48.919
-You know.
-Mm-hmm.

879
00:34:48.954 --> 00:34:51.388
I mean, I don't know why.

880
00:34:51.423 --> 00:34:53.757
But there's just so many things

881
00:34:53.792 --> 00:34:55.592
I didn't really know how to do.

882
00:34:55.627 --> 00:34:56.893
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

883
00:34:56.929 --> 00:34:59.463
Such as?

884
00:34:59.498 --> 00:35:04.167
Well, I learned I like being
part of a team, you know?

885
00:35:04.236 --> 00:35:05.769
Finding new ways to create
deeper connections

886
00:35:05.804 --> 00:35:08.572
with the restaurant, community.

887
00:35:08.607 --> 00:35:10.140
You really are
a big picture guy, aren't you?

888
00:35:10.175 --> 00:35:12.776
The details on the other hand,

889
00:35:12.811 --> 00:35:13.844
the decorations, the publicity.

890
00:35:13.912 --> 00:35:15.112
Hey.

891
00:35:15.147 --> 00:35:17.013
I'm learning.

892
00:35:17.082 --> 00:35:18.648
As a matter of fact,
I told maryanne

893
00:35:18.684 --> 00:35:20.183
to give me the food bank
donor list.

894
00:35:20.252 --> 00:35:21.785
As soon as alex is done
with that email blast...

895
00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:23.487
Invites away.
[exploding sound]

896
00:35:23.522 --> 00:35:24.921
[exploding sound]

897
00:35:26.825 --> 00:35:28.125
frank: You know, I'm really

898
00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.427
enjoying myself
this morning, meg.

899
00:35:30.462 --> 00:35:32.028
Well, I just hope that we win
this party challenge

900
00:35:32.097 --> 00:35:33.597
so we can help give even more.

901
00:35:33.632 --> 00:35:34.831
What do you mean?

902
00:35:34.867 --> 00:35:37.267
If we win the prize money,

903
00:35:37.302 --> 00:35:38.935
it's gonna go towards expanding
the food bank

904
00:35:38.971 --> 00:35:39.302
into kind of a free
grocery store.

905
00:35:39.338 --> 00:35:41.271
Oh.

906
00:35:41.306 --> 00:35:42.939
Food banks are amazing,
and at the store,

907
00:35:42.975 --> 00:35:44.274
people have even more
choices.

908
00:35:44.309 --> 00:35:46.510
Wow. That's awesome.

909
00:35:46.545 --> 00:35:51.148
Okay! I got you a gift

910
00:35:51.183 --> 00:35:52.816
that you're really gonna love.

911
00:35:52.851 --> 00:35:56.119
This is a double wide tree.

912
00:35:56.155 --> 00:35:58.688
And I got you a gift that
you're really gonna love,

913
00:35:58.724 --> 00:36:01.358
it's a double,
double wide tree.

914
00:36:04.563 --> 00:36:05.829
What, are we
selling these things now?

915
00:36:05.864 --> 00:36:07.664
So let me get this straight,

916
00:36:07.699 --> 00:36:10.300
uh, you got me a tree, and I
got you a tree.

917
00:36:10.335 --> 00:36:12.836
Great minds think alike, huh?

918
00:36:12.871 --> 00:36:14.304
We should take these out back,
put them in some water.

919
00:36:14.339 --> 00:36:17.541
Now hold on. One second.

920
00:36:17.576 --> 00:36:19.809
Let me just...(strains)hold on.

921
00:36:19.845 --> 00:36:21.144
Frank?

922
00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:24.047
Don't move.

923
00:36:24.082 --> 00:36:26.983
This is a perfect picture
for the email blast

924
00:36:27.019 --> 00:36:29.019
for the food bank donor list.
They'll love it!

925
00:36:29.054 --> 00:36:31.421
Ha ha! Yes!
[camera clicks]

926
00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:32.822
yes. Look at this picture!

927
00:36:32.858 --> 00:36:35.492
It's so good!

928
00:36:35.527 --> 00:36:37.527
This is so great.

929
00:36:37.563 --> 00:36:39.896
Ah, maybe we should start
coordinating

930
00:36:39.932 --> 00:36:42.432
our screwball mistakes.

931
00:36:42.501 --> 00:36:44.434
This was the best possible
kind of screwball mistake.

932
00:36:44.503 --> 00:36:45.835
I agree.

933
00:36:48.774 --> 00:36:50.173
Actually, maybe you're right
about
trees in the restaurant.

934
00:36:50.209 --> 00:36:52.108
Maybe we should
put them in the back.

935
00:36:52.177 --> 00:36:54.444
Dinner prep is handled.

936
00:36:54.513 --> 00:36:55.879
Everyone in the kitchen
knows what to do.

937
00:36:55.914 --> 00:36:57.914
This place could run without me.

938
00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:59.916
Which is good 'cause I could
use a break.

939
00:36:59.952 --> 00:37:01.551
Up for a quick walk?

940
00:37:01.587 --> 00:37:03.553
Oh, look at these decorations.

941
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:06.556
Yeah, salt lake knows how
to do business, for sure.

942
00:37:06.592 --> 00:37:08.758
Any news from jennifer?

943
00:37:08.794 --> 00:37:11.294
She's loving spending
so much time with simon.

944
00:37:11.363 --> 00:37:12.562
I think the theater
really lit something

945
00:37:12.598 --> 00:37:14.197
inside of her, you know?

946
00:37:14.233 --> 00:37:17.467
--Hmm.
-What?

947
00:37:17.536 --> 00:37:19.703
I know it's everyone's first
christmas without your uncle,

948
00:37:19.738 --> 00:37:20.470
and I'm glad jennifer
and simon are doing well.

949
00:37:20.539 --> 00:37:22.772
I'm fine. Really.

950
00:37:22.808 --> 00:37:24.641
I am. I'm having fun.

951
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:26.576
Helping out with the party.
Helping the staff.

952
00:37:26.612 --> 00:37:28.245
I almost don't want to leave.

953
00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:29.913
But you are, right?
Off to France?

954
00:37:29.948 --> 00:37:32.415
[cell phone rings]
-I'm...

955
00:37:32.451 --> 00:37:35.085
-Oh, sorry.
-No problem.

956
00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.586
-I have to take this.
-Okay.

957
00:37:36.622 --> 00:37:37.754
I'll see you
back at the restaurant?

958
00:37:37.789 --> 00:37:39.256
Of course.

959
00:37:39.291 --> 00:37:39.923
[sighs]

960
00:37:43.128 --> 00:37:46.162
take two. It's christmas.

961
00:37:46.231 --> 00:37:46.963
Thank you.

962
00:37:49.635 --> 00:37:52.235
Have you seen how many rsvps
we've gotten?

963
00:37:52.271 --> 00:37:54.504
Oh, wow! This is

964
00:37:54.573 --> 00:37:56.306
-way too many.
-Really good news.

965
00:37:56.341 --> 00:37:57.974
This is 20 over what
the restaurant will hold,

966
00:37:58.010 --> 00:38:00.010
and it's still growing.

967
00:38:00.078 --> 00:38:03.346
Aw. Well,
it's a real party now.

968
00:38:03.415 --> 00:38:05.248
Where are we
gonna put all these people?

969
00:38:05.284 --> 00:38:07.751
And how much christmas cheer
can we spread

970
00:38:07.786 --> 00:38:10.320
if everyone is waiting outside
trying to get in?

971
00:38:10.355 --> 00:38:12.622
That's a really good
problem to have.

972
00:38:12.658 --> 00:38:15.358
Some may even say this
is a christmas miracle.

973
00:38:15.427 --> 00:38:16.960
I wish I had your optimism.

974
00:38:16.995 --> 00:38:18.428
Honestly, me too.

975
00:38:18.463 --> 00:38:20.096
Meg, joe.

976
00:38:22.167 --> 00:38:24.301
I have news. First...

977
00:38:24.336 --> 00:38:25.869
I got the job!

978
00:38:25.937 --> 00:38:28.204
The naidre miller?

979
00:38:28.273 --> 00:38:30.774
What? Congratulations,
victoria!

980
00:38:30.809 --> 00:38:32.008
We know how much
you wanted this.

981
00:38:32.044 --> 00:38:33.777
Thank you.

982
00:38:33.812 --> 00:38:34.978
I mean, it's terrible for us.

983
00:38:35.013 --> 00:38:36.112
We're never gonna be the same.

984
00:38:38.116 --> 00:38:39.182
But we're thrilled, victoria.

985
00:38:39.217 --> 00:38:41.184
We really are thrilled for you.

986
00:38:41.219 --> 00:38:43.286
And my sister jane
is having triplets.

987
00:38:43.322 --> 00:38:45.055
-Yes!
-Whoa.

988
00:38:45.123 --> 00:38:46.623
I'm so excited to get them
little matching outfits.

989
00:38:46.658 --> 00:38:48.058
No, no, no, no.
She's having them right now.

990
00:38:48.126 --> 00:38:50.226
As we speak.

991
00:38:50.295 --> 00:38:52.829
Right now? Is everything okay?

992
00:38:52.864 --> 00:38:55.398
Yes. Triplets come early.
It's normal, I guess, but,

993
00:38:55.467 --> 00:38:57.133
but she's going to need help,

994
00:38:57.169 --> 00:38:59.869
and the job starts soon,
and...

995
00:38:59.905 --> 00:39:01.204
I have to go.

996
00:39:01.239 --> 00:39:01.871
Tomorrow.

997
00:39:03.508 --> 00:39:04.841
Tomorrow.

998
00:39:04.876 --> 00:39:06.910
You're leaving?

999
00:39:06.978 --> 00:39:08.178
-You're gonna go.
-Okay.

1000
00:39:08.213 --> 00:39:09.846
Okay.

1001
00:39:09.881 --> 00:39:12.749
Of course. Congratulations.

1002
00:39:12.818 --> 00:39:14.150
-This is good news.
-Yeah.

1003
00:39:14.186 --> 00:39:14.984
Yeah. I'm excited for you.

1004
00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.586
It's huge!

1005
00:39:16.655 --> 00:39:18.188
And don't worry
about this here.

1006
00:39:18.223 --> 00:39:20.256
-Yes.
-We got this.

1007
00:39:20.325 --> 00:39:21.391
-We have totally got this.
-We got this.

1008
00:39:21.426 --> 00:39:23.326
Thank you, guys.

1009
00:39:23.362 --> 00:39:23.993
[joe sighs]

1010
00:39:26.198 --> 00:39:27.564
both: No chef.

1011
00:39:34.172 --> 00:39:38.108
Uh, it's time to call jennifer.

1012
00:39:38.176 --> 00:39:40.510
No. No, I know she needs
to be there.

1013
00:39:40.545 --> 00:39:42.746
And my parents need her there.

1014
00:39:42.781 --> 00:39:45.281
And tonight's the opening
of the theater. Just...

1015
00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:46.282
-We can handle this.
-How?

1016
00:39:46.351 --> 00:39:49.285
What's the plan?

1017
00:39:49.354 --> 00:39:50.186
I-I don't know yet.

1018
00:40:10.842 --> 00:40:11.241
[doorbell rings]

1019
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:26.589
hi.

1020
00:40:26.658 --> 00:40:27.924
Hi. I brought coffee.

1021
00:40:27.993 --> 00:40:30.026
Oh. Not cocoa?

1022
00:40:30.061 --> 00:40:31.428
Listen, cocoa is delicious.
I like cocoa a lot.

1023
00:40:31.496 --> 00:40:32.929
But why is it every December

1024
00:40:32.998 --> 00:40:34.330
that's all anyone
ever offers me?

1025
00:40:34.366 --> 00:40:36.332
Why are we suddenly not allowed
to drink coffee?

1026
00:40:36.368 --> 00:40:37.600
It actually sounds like
you could use some coffee.

1027
00:40:37.669 --> 00:40:39.035
Come on in.

1028
00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:41.504
Thanks.

1029
00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:43.373
So...

1030
00:40:43.408 --> 00:40:44.908
[door closes]

1031
00:40:44.943 --> 00:40:47.177
I came by today
to tell you that

1032
00:40:47.212 --> 00:40:49.245
I didn't tell jennifer yet.

1033
00:40:49.281 --> 00:40:50.547
I appreciate that.

1034
00:40:50.582 --> 00:40:52.015
You know, I'll tell her

1035
00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:53.750
at the hazelwood
park tree lighting.

1036
00:40:53.785 --> 00:40:54.684
But it's my job to tell her,
uh, today.

1037
00:40:54.719 --> 00:40:56.586
If she finds out that we
replaced

1038
00:40:56.621 --> 00:40:58.254
a new head chef
with someone else,

1039
00:40:58.290 --> 00:41:00.557
well, that wouldn't make me
good at my job.

1040
00:41:00.592 --> 00:41:02.959
You know what? Just tell her

1041
00:41:03.028 --> 00:41:03.960
that I've been interviewing
the whole time.

1042
00:41:04.029 --> 00:41:05.261
You absolutely have.

1043
00:41:05.297 --> 00:41:07.530
-Wow.
-Yeah.

1044
00:41:07.566 --> 00:41:09.132
You know what, I'll call her.

1045
00:41:09.201 --> 00:41:11.601
I'll call her up,

1046
00:41:11.636 --> 00:41:14.037
I'll tell her that the search
process is well underway,

1047
00:41:14.072 --> 00:41:15.472
and then I'll counter with
the really good news

1048
00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:17.373
that we've got so many rsvps

1049
00:41:17.409 --> 00:41:18.608
that we've outgrown
the restaurant.

1050
00:41:18.643 --> 00:41:21.778
That doesn't feel better.

1051
00:41:21.813 --> 00:41:23.313
I have a lead on a new chef.

1052
00:41:23.381 --> 00:41:24.647
Oh! You do?

1053
00:41:24.716 --> 00:41:26.449
Jesse collins.

1054
00:41:26.485 --> 00:41:27.817
I know that name.

I never should've left
for this long.

1403
00:55:20.484 --> 00:55:21.350
Alright, we're going back
to the city.

1404
00:55:21.419 --> 00:55:22.751
We gotta figure this out.

1405
00:55:22.787 --> 00:55:24.253
Okay, well, what about
the theater?

1406
00:55:24.288 --> 00:55:26.255
-Wait...
-You don't have to...

1407
00:55:26.290 --> 00:55:27.356
Jen, we really,
we have it under control.

1408
00:55:27.425 --> 00:55:28.791
-Yes.
-We really do.

1409
00:55:28.826 --> 00:55:30.292
I'm sorry, meg,
but can you understand

1410
00:55:30.328 --> 00:55:31.593
how it doesn't
seem that way to me?

1411
00:55:37.802 --> 00:55:38.600
Excuse me one minute.

1412
00:55:57.421 --> 00:55:58.787
Jennifer: Simon,
I understand, but--

1413
00:55:58.823 --> 00:56:00.289
no, no. I get that you're
trying to come up

1414
00:56:00.324 --> 00:56:02.324
with what we're doing next,

1415
00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:03.525
and if we have to go back
to salt lake after this,

1416
00:56:03.594 --> 00:56:05.427
and this is all just

1417
00:56:05.463 --> 00:56:06.528
a really good dream, that's
okay.

1418
00:56:06.597 --> 00:56:08.163
I just really
want to make sure

1419
00:56:08.199 --> 00:56:09.264
that we can do this
tomorrow.

1420
00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:12.935
Okay. Well, I'll turn around

1421
00:56:12.970 --> 00:56:13.969
and come back as soon as I
get everything in order.

1422
00:56:14.004 --> 00:56:15.204
I love you.

1423
00:56:15.272 --> 00:56:16.271
I love you, too.

1424
00:56:25.282 --> 00:56:26.682
Meg?

1425
00:56:26.717 --> 00:56:29.151
You can come out now.

1426
00:56:29.186 --> 00:56:32.054
What? No, I'm not--
I just...

1427
00:56:32.123 --> 00:56:34.390
I just wanted to make sure
that this pole was secure.

1428
00:56:34.458 --> 00:56:36.158
The structure
of these whole buildings.

1429
00:56:36.193 --> 00:56:37.526
Of course.

1430
00:56:37.561 --> 00:56:38.727
-Critical.
-Yeah.

1431
00:56:38.796 --> 00:56:40.662
How'd you know I was there?

1432
00:56:40.698 --> 00:56:41.230
You know, I see a lot more than
people give me credit for.

1433
00:56:41.298 --> 00:56:43.165
Come on.

1434
00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:46.969
So, staying in hazelwood,
are you?

1435
00:56:47.004 --> 00:56:48.570
What's that about?

1436
00:56:48.639 --> 00:56:51.974
Are you kidding?
I love it here.

1437
00:56:52.009 --> 00:56:53.175
I mean, we almost have
the theater up and running.

1438
00:56:53.210 --> 00:56:54.910
Mom is happier and more relaxed

1439
00:56:54.979 --> 00:56:57.012
than I've seen her in years.

1440
00:56:57.047 --> 00:56:59.715
With the exception of
last night, but that's on me.

1441
00:56:59.750 --> 00:57:01.517
Yeah, no. I wouldn't worry
too much about that.

1442
00:57:01.552 --> 00:57:03.152
You guys always bring out
the best in each other.

1443
00:57:03.187 --> 00:57:06.522
Hi! Mom, do you have those
lattes for joe and me?

1444
00:57:06.557 --> 00:57:08.424
Gee, it was good to see you

1445
00:57:08.492 --> 00:57:09.191
at the tree lighting
last night.

1446
00:57:09.226 --> 00:57:11.560
Mm, I had the best time.

1447
00:57:11.595 --> 00:57:13.228
Thank you for lending joe
the couch.

1448
00:57:13.264 --> 00:57:15.197
Joe, we just hope
you were comfortable.

1449
00:57:15.232 --> 00:57:17.533
Oh, it was perfect.

1450
00:57:17.568 --> 00:57:19.568
How often do you get to sleep
next to a christmas tree?

1451
00:57:19.603 --> 00:57:21.603
(laughs) we just loved
having you.

1452
00:57:21.672 --> 00:57:23.439
Oh, thank you.

1453
00:57:23.507 --> 00:57:24.706
The more chance we get to
spend time with you,

1454
00:57:24.742 --> 00:57:27.376
before you go to France,
the better.

1455
00:57:27.411 --> 00:57:29.077
Have you bought that
return ticket yet?

1456
00:57:29.113 --> 00:57:30.913
Dad, I know you think
I'm being reckless.

1457
00:57:30.948 --> 00:57:33.348
We have said no such thing.

1458
00:57:33.384 --> 00:57:35.284
If you are sure that this
is what you want to do,

1459
00:57:35.352 --> 00:57:36.852
we support you.

1460
00:57:36.887 --> 00:57:37.553
Thank you.

1461
00:57:39.890 --> 00:57:42.057
Well, uh, we should
get on the road.

1462
00:57:42.092 --> 00:57:43.959
Mr. And mrs. Swift.

1463
00:57:44.028 --> 00:57:45.461
-Bye, I love you.
-It was a pleasure.

1464
00:57:45.529 --> 00:57:45.894
-Yes, sir.
-So nice to meet you.

1465
00:57:45.930 --> 00:57:48.263
Alright.

1466
00:57:48.299 --> 00:57:50.799
Radio: ♪ we wish you
a merry christmas ♪

1467
00:57:50.868 --> 00:57:53.268
♪ we wish you
a merry christmas ♪

1468
00:57:53.304 --> 00:57:55.871
♪ we wish you a merry...

1469
00:57:55.906 --> 00:57:58.373
You know, these are classic
christmas
tunes playing here.

1470
00:57:58.409 --> 00:57:59.141
Want to sing along?

1471
00:58:02.313 --> 00:58:04.046
Sorry. I was just trying
to think through

1472
00:58:04.081 --> 00:58:05.481
this chef problem,
that's all.

1473
00:58:05.549 --> 00:58:07.916
Maybe you can send someone
from paris.

1474
00:58:11.088 --> 00:58:13.155
I'm just surprised

1475
00:58:13.224 --> 00:58:15.224
you haven't mentioned
this trip at all.

1476
00:58:15.259 --> 00:58:16.992
Well, I wasn't trying to
keep it a secret.

1477
00:58:17.061 --> 00:58:18.327
-Mm.
-Or anything.

1478
00:58:18.395 --> 00:58:20.162
To be honest,

1479
00:58:20.231 --> 00:58:21.296
I don't even know if
it's what I want.

1480
00:58:26.136 --> 00:58:27.503
There's gotta be someone
right in front of us.

1481
00:58:27.571 --> 00:58:30.572
Chef position.
Someone we're not...

1482
00:58:33.110 --> 00:58:34.243
Hold on. Hold on.

1483
00:58:34.278 --> 00:58:35.844
I have an idea.

1484
00:58:35.913 --> 00:58:37.779
[phone rings]

1485
00:58:37.815 --> 00:58:40.782
hi. Oh, hi. It's me.

1486
00:58:40.818 --> 00:58:42.584
Um, listen, I need you
to find

1487
00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:44.520
my sister jennifer's article

1488
00:58:44.588 --> 00:58:46.755
from great salt magazine
from last year.

1489
00:58:46.790 --> 00:58:49.124
And also, talk to me about
the red velvet doughnuts.

1490
00:58:57.201 --> 00:58:58.934
So you think this is
our new chef?

1491
00:58:58.969 --> 00:59:01.203
I mean, martin's great.
I like the guy.

1492
00:59:01.272 --> 00:59:02.971
But I don't think he's ready
for a kitchen like ours.

1493
00:59:03.007 --> 00:59:05.340
His food is best
I've had here.

1494
00:59:05.376 --> 00:59:06.508
Plus, we already know he
fits in with the staff

1495
00:59:06.544 --> 00:59:08.677
which is always a gamble

1496
00:59:08.712 --> 00:59:09.177
when you're hiring
off of an interview.

1497
00:59:09.213 --> 00:59:11.313
That's true.

1498
00:59:11.348 --> 00:59:13.615
-Hey, all. Back--
-hey!

1499
00:59:13.651 --> 00:59:15.017
Wait, you're...
You're jennifer swift.

1500
00:59:15.052 --> 00:59:17.619
Mm, yeah.

1501
00:59:17.655 --> 00:59:19.721
Martin: Wow, okay, uh,
your article last year

1502
00:59:19.790 --> 00:59:23.125
in great salt about uh,
hospitality,

1503
00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:24.026
and community building,
like that--

1504
00:59:24.061 --> 00:59:26.628
yeah.

1505
00:59:26.664 --> 00:59:28.196
That is always what I've
believed
restaurants can be.

1506
00:59:28.232 --> 00:59:29.998
Wow. Well, thank you.

1507
00:59:30.034 --> 00:59:32.568
-Thank you so much.
-Of course.

1508
00:59:32.636 --> 00:59:33.802
Um, we'll each have one
of everything, please.

1509
00:59:33.837 --> 00:59:37.072
-Oh, wow!
-Mm-hmm!

1510
00:59:37.141 --> 00:59:38.006
You know, I would
come here every day!

1511
00:59:38.042 --> 00:59:40.208
Of course!

1512
00:59:40.244 --> 00:59:43.912
You know what?
We need someone immediately.

1513
00:59:43.981 --> 00:59:45.347
I say, let's do it.
Let's make him an offer.

1514
00:59:45.382 --> 00:59:46.682
Yeah?

1515
00:59:46.717 --> 00:59:48.383
(laughs)

1516
00:59:48.419 --> 00:59:51.053
okay.
I'll make him an offer.

1517
00:59:51.088 --> 00:59:51.853
Great.

1518
00:59:57.695 --> 01:00:00.162
Are you two...

1519
01:00:00.197 --> 01:00:02.564
-Is there...
-Between us? (coughs)

1520
01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:04.433
what? Like a romantic...

1521
01:00:04.501 --> 01:00:06.768
(meg coughs) no. We are--

1522
01:00:06.837 --> 01:00:08.337
work in the store.
(coughs)

1523
01:00:08.372 --> 01:00:10.072
I'm just gonna...

1524
01:00:10.107 --> 01:00:11.340
Get some water.
(clears throat)

1525
01:00:14.612 --> 01:00:17.879
hey, joe. What's going on?

1526
01:00:17.915 --> 01:00:19.881
You know, you know
your sister's vision.

1527
01:00:19.917 --> 01:00:21.750
And beyond that, you know,
you uh,

1528
01:00:21.785 --> 01:00:23.585
push things
to the next level.

1529
01:00:23.621 --> 01:00:24.186
It's been amazing to watch.
And helpful.

1530
01:00:24.221 --> 01:00:26.188
Thank you.

1531
01:00:26.223 --> 01:00:28.557
Martin can cook, I think
the staff and I

1532
01:00:28.592 --> 01:00:30.225
can help him
find his way around.

1533
01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:31.593
Bigger kitchen.

1534
01:00:31.629 --> 01:00:33.962
So what's going on here?

1535
01:00:34.031 --> 01:00:36.865
Well, I was thinking
to myself yesterday,

1536
01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:38.233
on the carriage ride,

1537
01:00:38.268 --> 01:00:40.235
that you and I,

1538
01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:45.407
we fit.

1539
01:00:45.442 --> 01:00:49.111
Yes. I was thinking it too,

1540
01:00:49.146 --> 01:00:50.479
but you said that you wanted
something more permanent.

1541
01:00:50.547 --> 01:00:52.214
I know. Um...

1542
01:00:54.652 --> 01:00:56.585
And, and you're going off
to France, and uh...

1543
01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:59.488
Maybe not. I don't know.

1544
01:00:59.556 --> 01:01:01.456
Either way, you know,
um...

1545
01:01:01.492 --> 01:01:03.058
Either way,

1546
01:01:03.093 --> 01:01:05.560
I have a chef I gotta

1547
01:01:05.596 --> 01:01:06.728
hire and train.

1548
01:01:11.635 --> 01:01:11.933
And so, I'll see you
back at the uh...

1549
01:01:14.271 --> 01:01:15.137
Oh, you...

1550
01:01:17.474 --> 01:01:20.075
-Hi.
-Hi.

1551
01:01:20.110 --> 01:01:20.909
It's complicated.

1552
01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:25.480
Come on.

1553
01:01:25.516 --> 01:01:27.816
I'm sorry I didn't trust you,

1554
01:01:27.851 --> 01:01:28.583
you really do know
what you're doing, meg.

1555
01:01:30.354 --> 01:01:31.753
Thanks.

1556
01:01:31.789 --> 01:01:33.689
You okay over there?

1557
01:01:33.757 --> 01:01:37.092
I am. You know,
the longer I'm here,

1558
01:01:37.127 --> 01:01:37.526
the more I think maybe
instead of going to France,

1559
01:01:37.594 --> 01:01:39.661
I should

1560
01:01:39.697 --> 01:01:42.798
use that money to start
something of my own.

1561
01:01:42.833 --> 01:01:44.299
I mean, I'm worried that
without uncle dave,

1562
01:01:44.334 --> 01:01:46.301
France is gonna feel...

1563
01:01:46.336 --> 01:01:48.103
Like hazelwood.

1564
01:01:48.138 --> 01:01:49.871
But with better cheese.

1565
01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:51.273
[jennifer chuckles]

1566
01:01:51.308 --> 01:01:53.008
you know,

1567
01:01:53.043 --> 01:01:55.310
one thing
I know about grief,

1568
01:01:55.345 --> 01:01:57.646
is that you will get to
the other side of it.

1569
01:01:57.681 --> 01:02:00.849
And it's good to do
what feels best

1570
01:02:00.884 --> 01:02:02.117
while you're
moving through it.

1571
01:02:02.152 --> 01:02:04.186
Maybe for you, that's cheese.

1572
01:02:04.221 --> 01:02:05.353
(chuckles) right now,
it feels best

1573
01:02:05.389 --> 01:02:07.122
just sitting here with you.

1574
01:02:07.157 --> 01:02:08.323
I'm glad you came back.

1575
01:02:08.358 --> 01:02:10.525
Mm. Me too.

1576
01:02:10.561 --> 01:02:12.127
And I'm really excited
to sit next to you

1577
01:02:12.162 --> 01:02:13.195
tomorrow night
and watch a movie.

1578
01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:14.196
Yeah.

1579
01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:17.799
This is a really good space.

1580
01:02:30.013 --> 01:02:31.680
Oh, look at her. Wow!

1581
01:02:31.715 --> 01:02:33.715

01:02:54.938 --> 01:02:56.338
-Oh!
-Aah!

1591
01:02:56.373 --> 01:02:57.439
You okay? (laughs)

1592
01:02:57.508 --> 01:02:59.374
yeah. I'm good.

1593
01:02:59.409 --> 01:03:01.343
No jennifer?

1594
01:03:01.378 --> 01:03:02.410
Oh, no. She had to go back
to hazelwood.

1595
01:03:02.446 --> 01:03:03.779
Oh, okay.

1596
01:03:03.847 --> 01:03:05.413
I told her we had it.

1597
01:03:05.449 --> 01:03:07.549
We got it as long as you
hold on to me.

1598
01:03:07.584 --> 01:03:10.018
Oh, you having fun
with your ice skating?

1599
01:03:10.053 --> 01:03:11.353
(chuckles)
oh, I'm having a blast.

1600
01:03:11.388 --> 01:03:13.355
Yeah, seems like it.

1601
01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:15.524
And if I take the job,

1602
01:03:15.559 --> 01:03:17.626
you're sure you're okay
working together?

1603
01:03:17.694 --> 01:03:19.694
Well, the way I see it,

1604
01:03:19.730 --> 01:03:21.897
we're both smart,
reasonable people.

1605
01:03:21.932 --> 01:03:23.932
I just, I don't want to risk

1606
01:03:23.967 --> 01:03:27.269
whatever...This is for--

1607
01:03:32.576 --> 01:03:34.709
just take the job.

1608
01:03:34.745 --> 01:03:36.378
We'll work out
whatever happens next.

1609
01:03:36.413 --> 01:03:37.078
Yeah?

1610
01:03:38.749 --> 01:03:41.383
Okay.

1611
01:03:41.418 --> 01:03:43.385
Announcer: Alright, everyone.
Grab a partner

1612
01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:45.754
because it's time for
the mistletoe skate.

1614
01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:52.227
thank you!

♪ the little things,

1616
01:04:01.071 --> 01:04:02.938
what you said earlier...

1617
01:04:02.973 --> 01:04:04.406
It's like you said before,
you know,

1618
01:04:04.441 --> 01:04:05.907
in order to add someone
to your life,

1619
01:04:08.478 --> 01:04:09.678
you have to know
what you're looking for.

1620
01:04:09.746 --> 01:04:12.180
And uh,

1621
01:04:12.249 --> 01:04:15.283
it's obvious,
you're still searching.

Maryanne: I don't want to
disturb anything,

1626
01:04:52.322 --> 01:04:53.955
but just think about it.

1627
01:04:53.991 --> 01:04:54.756
Joe: I will.
Thank you, maryanne.

1628
01:05:01.698 --> 01:05:02.764
-Hey.
Hey.

1629
01:05:02.799 --> 01:05:04.699
Everything okay?

1630
01:05:04.768 --> 01:05:07.669
Yeah. Just some uh,

1631
01:05:07.704 --> 01:05:08.203
some things for me
to think about, so.

1632
01:05:10.307 --> 01:05:11.940
It's nice in here, right?

1633
01:05:11.975 --> 01:05:14.342
Yeah. You were right.

1634
01:05:14.378 --> 01:05:15.944
The wreaths and the garland
are beautiful.

1635
01:05:15.979 --> 01:05:17.479
-Simple, tasteful.
-Oh.

1636
01:05:17.514 --> 01:05:20.615
Not prim or victorian?

1637
01:05:20.651 --> 01:05:22.717
Not until we start
bringing in

1638
01:05:22.786 --> 01:05:23.652
the tiny cakes
with small, ornate spoons.

1639
01:05:23.687 --> 01:05:26.888
(laughs) so...

1640
01:05:26.957 --> 01:05:28.957
We're okay?

1641
01:05:31.628 --> 01:05:34.195
Yeah. Yeah, I think
you were right,

1642
01:05:34.231 --> 01:05:36.998
I-I don't know
what's next for me.

1643
01:05:37.034 --> 01:05:39.034
But the more I think,
about it...

1644
01:05:41.838 --> 01:05:44.372
I mean, look at this place.

1645
01:05:44.408 --> 01:05:47.075
It has been

1646
01:05:47.144 --> 01:05:50.645
a memorable time,
you know?

1647
01:05:50.681 --> 01:05:52.580
The more I try to pin down
what's next for me,

1648
01:05:52.649 --> 01:05:54.649
the more I think it's,
it's here.

1649
01:05:54.685 --> 01:05:57.852
The restaurant, the people,

1650
01:06:01.224 --> 01:06:03.258
and then I think,
oh, good job.

1651
01:06:03.327 --> 01:06:05.260
Meg, you've just imagined
yourself

1652
01:06:05.329 --> 01:06:07.696
directly into your
big sister's life.

1653
01:06:07.731 --> 01:06:09.230
And that's not what I want.
I want

1654
01:06:09.266 --> 01:06:10.498
something that's mine.

1655
01:06:10.534 --> 01:06:12.600
Hmm.

1656
01:06:12.669 --> 01:06:13.668
And on and on I go in
my brain around and around.

1657
01:06:18.241 --> 01:06:20.075
You know, I have to go.

1658
01:06:20.110 --> 01:06:21.543
Um, I have to swing by
the restaurant

1659
01:06:21.578 --> 01:06:23.111
before I head to hazelwood.

1660
01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:23.845
I'll ride to the restaurant
with you.

1661
01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:25.547
Okay.

1662
01:06:25.582 --> 01:06:26.081
Yeah, I got a few things
to pick up.

1663
01:06:26.116 --> 01:06:28.083
Okay.

1664
01:06:28.118 --> 01:06:30.185
Hey, that lunch rush
is kind of taking...

1665
01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:31.853
It's happening. She's here.

1666
01:06:31.888 --> 01:06:32.754
Frank's daughter
waiting at his table.

1667

-Okay.
-Yeah.

-We gotta be cool.
-Yeah.

1669
01:06:37.294 --> 01:06:38.360
Frank's here.

1670
01:06:38.395 --> 01:06:41.429
He's here. Hi.

1671
01:06:41.465 --> 01:06:43.732
Uh, frank, how-how are you?

1672
01:06:43.767 --> 01:06:45.400
We have some exciting things
on the menu today

1673
01:06:45.435 --> 01:06:46.434
you're gonna enjoy.

1674
01:06:48.305 --> 01:06:49.037
Nina.

1675
01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:59.114
How are you?

1676
01:06:59.149 --> 01:07:00.949
-[meg whispering] okay.
-Okay.

1677
01:07:00.984 --> 01:07:02.550
No, wait. Hold on.
Just stay. Be cool.

1678
01:07:02.586 --> 01:07:05.320
Just, let's just feel it.

1679
01:07:05.389 --> 01:07:07.155
Just feel it.

1680
01:07:07.224 --> 01:07:08.089
I had no idea
you'd be here.

1681
01:07:08.125 --> 01:07:09.591
[nina inaudible]

1682
01:07:09.626 --> 01:07:10.892
I better tell everybody.

1683
01:07:10.927 --> 01:07:13.094
Sounds good.

1684
01:07:13.130 --> 01:07:14.629
Okay, for frank
and his daughter,

1685
01:07:14.664 --> 01:07:16.464
let's send out our very best.

1686
01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:18.266
Let's start with
the christmas tapas,

1687
01:07:18.301 --> 01:07:19.434
move on to the soup,
maybe with a garnish--

1688
01:07:19.469 --> 01:07:21.302
I got this. Use me.

1689
01:07:21.338 --> 01:07:22.470
Really? Okay.

1690
01:07:28.278 --> 01:07:29.277
I don't know
what else to do.

1691
01:07:29.312 --> 01:07:30.645
Nina, wait.

1692
01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:32.480
I came here out of love,

1693
01:07:32.516 --> 01:07:34.315
and you do this every time.

1694
01:07:34.351 --> 01:07:35.617
Frank: Nina...

1695
01:07:35.652 --> 01:07:37.452
Nina: Every time.

1696
01:07:37.487 --> 01:07:38.853
Frank: Why do you have to
be a hot head?

1697
01:07:38.922 --> 01:07:39.154
Nina: Oh, gosh, dad.
You'll never change.

1698
01:07:46.496 --> 01:07:48.496
Hey.

1699
01:07:48.532 --> 01:07:52.767
Some things just...
Take more time, I guess.

1700
01:07:52.803 --> 01:07:53.668
Is there anything we can do
for you?

1701
01:07:53.703 --> 01:07:56.004
No. No. Don't worry about me.

1702
01:07:56.039 --> 01:08:00.475
I'm back tomorrow.
But today...

1703
01:08:00.510 --> 01:08:00.875
Today, I'm just not hungry.

1704
01:08:07.651 --> 01:08:09.851
Should we...Go after him?

1705
01:08:09.886 --> 01:08:12.787
No. I think I've done enough
meddling for today.

1706
01:08:15.992 --> 01:08:16.791
I gotta get on the road
to hazelwood.

1707
01:08:40.050 --> 01:08:42.584
Nobody in this family
does anything by themselves.

1708
01:08:42.652 --> 01:08:44.018
Oh, yay!

1709
01:08:44.054 --> 01:08:44.819
[applause]

1710
01:09:54.124 --> 01:09:54.889
I'll be back.

1711
01:10:18.515 --> 01:10:20.615
Uncle dave: You know, people
aren't always

1712
01:10:20.650 --> 01:10:22.650
gonna listen to your ideas
or change their mind,

1713
01:10:22.686 --> 01:10:23.151
but that doesn't mean
you stop believing in them.

1714
01:10:26.656 --> 01:10:28.256
Uncle dave:
It takes a little patience.

1715
01:10:28.291 --> 01:10:29.657
And you gotta look
for the right time.

1716
01:10:29.693 --> 01:10:33.828
And then you show 'em
what you got.

1717
01:10:33.863 --> 01:10:35.496
You see? The two of you
working together.

1718
01:10:35.532 --> 01:10:36.831
Always the best plan.

1719
01:10:36.866 --> 01:10:37.932
[girls giggling]

1720
01:10:39.936 --> 01:10:41.469
I love you.

1721
01:10:41.504 --> 01:10:42.670
I love you, too.

1722
01:10:46.776 --> 01:10:49.110
(sighs)

1723
01:10:50.981 --> 01:10:52.880
what if we kept everything

1724
01:10:52.949 --> 01:10:55.717
exactly the way it is
right now?

1725
01:10:55.785 --> 01:10:57.318
Hmm.

1726
01:10:57.354 --> 01:10:59.821
Whoa.

1727
01:10:59.856 --> 01:11:01.656
Two sweet old ladies
sitting on a countertop.

1728
01:11:01.691 --> 01:11:03.191
Emphasis on the old.

1729
01:11:03.226 --> 01:11:04.692
True.

1730
01:11:04.728 --> 01:11:06.694
All I need is you, me,

1731
01:11:06.730 --> 01:11:08.730
and a comfortable place
to sit down.

1732
01:11:08.798 --> 01:11:11.332
And snacks.
[meg laughs]

1733
01:11:11.368 --> 01:11:12.734
oh. Snacks!

1734
01:11:12.802 --> 01:11:15.003
Yes!

1735
01:11:15.038 --> 01:11:15.803
Here.

1736
01:11:17.907 --> 01:11:19.907
Nailed it.

1737
01:11:19.976 --> 01:11:22.076
Hey, have you been down
to the basement?

1738
01:11:22.145 --> 01:11:24.012
It's huge. You know,
it's big enough

1739
01:11:24.047 --> 01:11:27.248
for like a working,
restaurant-sized kitchen.

1740
01:11:27.317 --> 01:11:29.317
A movie theater/restaurant's
a good idea.

1741
01:11:29.352 --> 01:11:30.585
I know, right?

1742
01:11:30.654 --> 01:11:31.486
I cancelled my flight.

1743
01:11:31.521 --> 01:11:32.920
What?

1744
01:11:32.989 --> 01:11:34.922
I love salt lake.

1745
01:11:34.991 --> 01:11:36.424
Whatever's next for me,

1746
01:11:36.493 --> 01:11:38.559
I think it's in that city.

1747
01:11:38.595 --> 01:11:40.161
I mean,
if I could work for you,

1748
01:11:40.196 --> 01:11:41.763
for a little while...

1749
01:11:41.831 --> 01:11:42.563
Oh, my gosh,
well, truth be told,

1750
01:11:42.599 --> 01:11:44.232
we should probably

1751
01:11:44.267 --> 01:11:45.600
both: Just go into business
together.

1752
01:11:45.669 --> 01:11:47.335
Wait. So that would mean
we...

1753
01:11:47.370 --> 01:11:48.936
...Pool our resources while...

1754
01:11:49.005 --> 01:11:49.904
...We run the restaurant
together and...

1755
01:11:49.939 --> 01:11:51.773
You build the kitchen.

1756
01:11:51.841 --> 01:11:53.207
And we keep the madison
in the family.

1757
01:11:53.243 --> 01:11:54.175
And then we build
whatever's next...

1758
01:11:54.210 --> 01:11:54.909
Both: Together.

1759
01:12:20.437 --> 01:12:21.235
[sighs]

1760
01:12:28.645 --> 01:12:29.877
whoa!

1761
01:12:35.418 --> 01:12:37.552
Time to whip up
a batch of brownies

1762
01:12:37.587 --> 01:12:40.121
and cuddle up in front of
your favorite cozy flick

1763
01:12:40.156 --> 01:12:41.923
because you're not going
anywhere.

1764
01:12:41.958 --> 01:12:43.758
A surprise christmas
snowstorm

1765
01:12:43.793 --> 01:12:45.760
has snarled traffic
all over the region.

1766
01:12:45.795 --> 01:12:47.929
Expect it to last
through tomorrow

1767
01:12:47.964 --> 01:12:48.730
in downtown salt lake city,

1768
01:12:51.601 --> 01:12:55.002
ooh hoo hoo!
It's really cold!

1769
01:12:55.071 --> 01:12:56.237
-Close your eyes.
-Whoa!

1770
01:12:56.272 --> 01:12:58.940
Oh, my gosh.
Is this a prank?

1771
01:12:58.975 --> 01:13:00.608
Am I about to be
sprayed with water?

1772
01:13:00.643 --> 01:13:02.577
No. Why would I,
why would I do that?

1773
01:13:02.612 --> 01:13:03.578
Just come with me.
Stand here.

1774
01:13:03.613 --> 01:13:04.779
What's happening? (laughs)

1775
01:13:04.814 --> 01:13:07.148
now. You were right.

1776
01:13:07.183 --> 01:13:08.816
A good party needs things
for people to do, so,

1777
01:13:08.852 --> 01:13:10.685
our team and I came up
with a few of those.

1778
01:13:10.754 --> 01:13:11.953
Voila.

1779
01:13:11.988 --> 01:13:14.088
(gasps) oh!

1780
01:13:14.124 --> 01:13:15.289
First, we have

1781
01:13:15.325 --> 01:13:17.291
a cookie decorating station.

1782
01:13:17.327 --> 01:13:18.860
Your suggestion.

1783
01:13:18.928 --> 01:13:21.429
I am gonna make
an entire fleet

1784
01:13:21.464 --> 01:13:22.830
of reindeer cookies
complete with

1785
01:13:22.866 --> 01:13:23.498
tiny, little
ugly christmas sweaters.

1786
01:13:26.002 --> 01:13:28.002
You said photo booths
were hokey!

1787
01:13:28.037 --> 01:13:29.871
And I stand by that.

1788
01:13:29.939 --> 01:13:32.273
Does it work?

1789
01:13:32.308 --> 01:13:34.842
Of course, it works.
Here. Here you go.

1790
01:13:34.878 --> 01:13:36.310
You just press this button.
Here, sit.

1791
01:13:36.346 --> 01:13:37.779
-Sit here.
[meg laughs]

1792
01:13:37.814 --> 01:13:39.614
ready? Say cheese!

1793
01:13:39.649 --> 01:13:42.850
-Cheese! (laughs)
[camera clicks]

1794
01:13:42.886 --> 01:13:45.653
(laughs) oh, I love it!

1795
01:13:45.688 --> 01:13:48.656
See? We make a great team,
right?

1796
01:13:48.691 --> 01:13:50.224
Yes. We do.

1797
01:13:50.293 --> 01:13:52.126
Speaking of which...

1798
01:13:52.162 --> 01:13:53.461
No, wait. I have something
I want to tell you.

1799
01:13:53.496 --> 01:13:56.063
I'm not going to France.
I'm gonna stay.

1800
01:13:56.132 --> 01:13:59.033
Right here.

1801
01:13:59.068 --> 01:14:01.369
Details are still being
worked out,

1802
01:14:01.404 --> 01:14:03.371
but I'm gonna go into
business with my sister.

1803
01:14:03.406 --> 01:14:08.342
Wow. So you're...Staying.

1804
01:14:08.378 --> 01:14:14.148
Yeah. Which, I think,
is good news, for us.

1805
01:14:14.184 --> 01:14:14.982
I hope.

1806
01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:18.319
Maryanne:
Oh. There you are.

1807
01:14:18.354 --> 01:14:20.021
We have a problem.

1808
01:14:20.056 --> 01:14:22.690
The roads are in terrible shape,

1809
01:14:22.725 --> 01:14:23.558
and they're asking anyone
who doesn't need to travel

1810
01:14:23.593 --> 01:14:25.726
to stay home.

1811
01:14:25.762 --> 01:14:27.728
Are people gonna be able to
get to the party tonight?

1812
01:14:27.764 --> 01:14:29.430
[cell phone buzzes]
-I don't know.

1813
01:14:29.499 --> 01:14:31.666
It doesn't matter.

1814
01:14:31.701 --> 01:14:33.167
The magazine just cancelled
everything.

1815
01:14:36.506 --> 01:14:37.171
Oh...

1816
01:14:44.247 --> 01:14:46.781
In consolation for cancelling
the parties,

1817
01:14:46.816 --> 01:14:48.749
great salt will be
splitting the prize money

1818
01:14:48.785 --> 01:14:50.418
among the chosen charities.

1819
01:14:50.453 --> 01:14:51.552
Wow! So we're still
gonna be getting

1820
01:14:51.588 --> 01:14:52.253
a good deal of money.

1821
01:14:52.288 --> 01:14:54.288
Sounds like it.

1822
01:14:54.324 --> 01:14:56.290
Is that gonna be enough
for you to start the store

1823
01:14:56.326 --> 01:14:57.992
oh, probably not.

1824
01:14:58.061 --> 01:15:00.328
But it will feed a lot
of people.

1825
01:15:00.396 --> 01:15:01.429
More than last year.

1826
01:15:01.464 --> 01:15:03.898
Oh, and joe.

1827
01:15:03.933 --> 01:15:05.399
Once you're onboard
full-time,

1828
01:15:05.435 --> 01:15:07.301
maybe we can use
some of the money

1829
01:15:07.337 --> 01:15:07.768
to start the outreach program
you wanted to start.

1830
01:15:07.804 --> 01:15:09.136
Full-time?

1831
01:15:09.172 --> 01:15:10.905
Uh...

1832
01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:12.507
Uh, I got...

1833
01:15:12.575 --> 01:15:13.908
Stuff to...Yeah.

1834
01:15:16.646 --> 01:15:18.980
Yeah, um...

1835
01:15:19.015 --> 01:15:21.983
Maryanne offered me
a full-time position.

1836
01:15:22.018 --> 01:15:23.451
It's longer than the hours
at the restaurant,

1837
01:15:23.486 --> 01:15:25.620
but it's absolutely
what I want

1838
01:15:25.655 --> 01:15:28.456
and uh, I accepted.
She said that

1839
01:15:28.491 --> 01:15:29.457
I could stay as long
as I need to,

1840
01:15:29.492 --> 01:15:30.791
until jennifer finds someone,

1841
01:15:30.827 --> 01:15:33.261
but since that's gonna be you...

1842
01:15:33.296 --> 01:15:36.264
This is great.
You're gonna be so happy.

1843
01:15:36.299 --> 01:15:37.431
It's perfect!

1844
01:15:42.138 --> 01:15:43.638
We should probably

1845
01:15:43.673 --> 01:15:50.211
figure out the uh... Wait.
Um...

1846
01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:52.446
What does this,
what does this mean about us?

1847
01:15:52.482 --> 01:15:53.848
You and me?

1848
01:15:53.883 --> 01:15:54.549
[door opens]

1849
01:15:59.188 --> 01:16:01.222
what is this?

1850
01:16:01.291 --> 01:16:03.124
This is rosemary potato
croquettes.

1851
01:16:03.159 --> 01:16:04.992
And a bite-size
turkey and stuffing

1852
01:16:05.028 --> 01:16:07.995
on water crackers
with a cranberry reduction.

1853
01:16:08.031 --> 01:16:10.331
Yeah, did you guys
not hear about the...

1854
01:16:10.366 --> 01:16:10.898
Oh, yeah. We-we saw the post
about
the party being cancelled

1855
01:16:10.967 --> 01:16:12.667
on our way here.

1856
01:16:12.702 --> 01:16:14.068
We thought we'd see
if maryanne

1857
01:16:14.137 --> 01:16:15.870
can't find a way
to distribute these.

1858
01:16:15.905 --> 01:16:17.705
All this food is not
about to go to waste.

1859
01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:21.909
Hold on. I have an idea. I
have to make a phone call.

1860
01:16:21.978 --> 01:16:24.178
I'm gonna...I... 02:16:32:17
--:--:--:--
You know wha t? This is... I'm
gonna...

1861
01:16:24.213 --> 01:16:24.979
Be back.

1862
01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:27.982
Nobody move.

1863
01:16:31.754 --> 01:16:33.387
[door slams]

1864
01:16:33.423 --> 01:16:35.323
alright, uh, we have to move.

1865
01:16:35.358 --> 01:16:37.892
Yeah. (laughs)

1866
01:16:37.927 --> 01:16:39.560
I'm gonna start taking down
the christmas decorations,

1867
01:16:39.596 --> 01:16:41.028
you guys should get that food
in the fridge.

1868
01:16:41.064 --> 01:16:44.198
Well, if the problem
is transportation,

1869
01:16:44.233 --> 01:16:46.200
maybe we could combine
our resources.

1870
01:16:46.235 --> 01:16:49.904
So, meg's staying.
That's...

1871
01:16:49.939 --> 01:16:52.707
I don't know. Is she?

1872
01:16:52.742 --> 01:16:55.076
Meg makes decisions faster than
any person I've ever met.

1873
01:16:55.111 --> 01:16:56.611
Says the guy who just
changed jobs

1874
01:16:56.679 --> 01:16:58.179
in the blink of an eye.

1875
01:16:58.214 --> 01:17:00.448
What is this
that you're doing?

1876
01:17:00.516 --> 01:17:02.583
And you would have room
for all of us?

1877
01:17:02.619 --> 01:17:04.218
Great!

1878
01:17:04.253 --> 01:17:06.687
Joe: Okay.

1879
01:17:06.723 --> 01:17:09.724
You have told me
to put myself out there.

1880
01:17:09.759 --> 01:17:12.693
Over and over and over.

1881
01:17:12.729 --> 01:17:13.594
You're embarrassing
about it honestly.

1882
01:17:13.630 --> 01:17:14.595
But this is different.

1883
01:17:14.631 --> 01:17:15.763
No, it's not.

1884
01:17:15.798 --> 01:17:18.032
It's the same.

1885
01:17:18.067 --> 01:17:19.634
Maybe things are moving
a little fast,

1886
01:17:19.702 --> 01:17:21.369
but that's just how
these things go.

1887
01:17:21.404 --> 01:17:23.104
If you miss this chance,

1888
01:17:23.139 --> 01:17:24.038
you might not get
another one.

1889
01:17:26.309 --> 01:17:27.575
Yeah.

1890
01:17:27.610 --> 01:17:31.145
(giggling) pack

1891
01:17:31.214 --> 01:17:32.413
everything up!

1892
01:17:32.448 --> 01:17:33.247
The party's back on!

1893
01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:38.886
[meg laughs]
-alright.

1894
01:17:41.457 --> 01:17:43.157
Meg: Hi!

1895
01:17:43.226 --> 01:17:45.126
You can start setting up
over here.

1896
01:17:45.161 --> 01:17:46.494
Yeah, we can't use
the whole space.

1897
01:17:46.562 --> 01:17:48.295
Yeah, we had to leave room

1898
01:17:48.331 --> 01:17:49.764
for the other restaurants
in the contest.

1899
01:17:49.799 --> 01:17:51.599
Joe: She combined forces
so people

1900
01:17:51.634 --> 01:17:53.334
can walk here so no matter
how bad the roads are,

1901
01:17:53.403 --> 01:17:54.568
or if they can't be driveable--

1902
01:17:54.604 --> 01:17:56.937
one party, everybody is welcome.

1903
01:17:56.973 --> 01:17:59.640
Not an invite list,
not a magazine

1904
01:17:59.676 --> 01:18:02.076
with a mysteriously
judgmental editorial board.

1905
01:18:02.111 --> 01:18:03.577
Anyone who can get here safely

1906
01:18:03.613 --> 01:18:05.479
is welcome.

1907
01:18:05.515 --> 01:18:07.481
[festive music plays]

1908
01:18:07.517 --> 01:18:08.082
[camera shutter clicks]

1909
01:18:18.528 --> 01:18:19.660
this looks amazing!

1910
01:18:19.696 --> 01:18:21.429
[meg screams]

1911
01:18:21.464 --> 01:18:23.030
you guys! How are you here?
The roads--

1912
01:18:23.099 --> 01:18:24.765
the roads were terrible.
Yes.

1913
01:18:24.801 --> 01:18:26.534
But we are mountain folk,

1914
01:18:26.602 --> 01:18:27.802
and we know how to put chains
on the tires.

1915
01:18:27.837 --> 01:18:30.037
We would not have missed this.

1916
01:18:30.106 --> 01:18:32.373
It just took
a little bit longer.

1917
01:18:32.442 --> 01:18:33.474
Mom, you hate driving
in the snow.

1918
01:18:33.509 --> 01:18:34.842
That was brave!

1919
01:18:34.877 --> 01:18:37.211
Brave? That?

1920
01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:40.281
You girls keep doing things
that inspire you.

1921
01:18:40.316 --> 01:18:42.049
And those things always seem
to help other people.

1922
01:18:42.118 --> 01:18:43.851
That, my darlings,
is bravery.

1923
01:18:43.886 --> 01:18:46.387
-Hi.
-Hi! (squealing)

1924
01:18:46.456 --> 01:18:48.622
-hi!
