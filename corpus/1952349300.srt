1
00:00:25,607 --> 00:00:28,201
Lord Boynton! Lord Boynton!

2
00:00:28,727 --> 00:00:32,800
Hey! (Shouting in Arabic)

3
00:00:32,847 --> 00:00:35,441
Quoi?!

4
00:01:35,327 --> 00:01:37,522
(Speaking Arabic)

5
00:02:13,127 --> 00:02:14,321
(Horse whinnies)

6
00:03:00,607 --> 00:03:02,882
(Traders calling out)

7
00:03:33,727 --> 00:03:36,605
Don't... Don't speak.

8
00:03:36,647 --> 00:03:38,558
Why not?

9
00:03:38,607 --> 00:03:42,964
You've got sunstroke, you need to stay
where you are, be quite still.

10
00:03:43,007 --> 00:03:48,525
Actually what I need to do is sit, I think,
and drink a lot of water. Shukran.

11
00:03:48,567 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm dehydrated.

12
00:03:50,047 --> 00:03:51,765
I've sent for a doctor.

13
00:03:51,807 --> 00:03:53,957
Already got one. Sarah King, MD.

14
00:03:54,007 --> 00:03:57,966
You're the fellow who's going to get
sunstroke, walking around without a hat.

15
00:03:58,007 --> 00:04:00,601
I just introduced myself.

16
00:04:05,327 --> 00:04:08,717
- (Woman) Raymond.
- Ah, my-my mother needs me.

17
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:13,638
If you can't introduce yourself, perhaps
you might introduce me to your mother?

18
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:15,803
Unlikely.

19
00:04:42,007 --> 00:04:44,123
- Thè au citron, s'il vous plaît.
- Oui, monsieur.

20
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:46,681
- Chaud, très chaud.
- Oui.

21
00:04:47,247 --> 00:04:50,364
Alas, madame, I am desolate.

22
00:04:50,407 --> 00:04:53,524
You have no newspapers
of any description?!

23
00:04:54,647 --> 00:04:56,160
I am so sorry.

24
00:04:56,207 --> 00:04:59,005
(Woman) You don't know
what sorry is!

25
00:05:07,327 --> 00:05:10,558
Got you, you double-distilled blighter!

26
00:05:10,607 --> 00:05:14,122
Colonel Carbury, mon vieux.

27
00:05:14,167 --> 00:05:16,237
Poirot.

28
00:05:17,327 --> 00:05:21,639
All these years travelling, you'd think
I'd be used to creepy-crawlies by now.

29
00:05:21,687 --> 00:05:25,441
I did not know that you were
the enthusiast for I'antiquitè.

30
00:05:25,487 --> 00:05:26,636
For what?

31
00:05:26,687 --> 00:05:28,917
You have come also for the exploration
of Lord Boynton?

32
00:05:28,967 --> 00:05:30,639
Ah, no, no. Passing through.

33
00:05:30,687 --> 00:05:33,201
Vraiment? To where
do you pass, Colonel?

34
00:05:33,247 --> 00:05:34,316
Here and there.

35
00:05:35,527 --> 00:05:37,677
You know, here and then... You know.

36
00:05:37,727 --> 00:05:40,161
- There?
- Or thereabouts.

37
00:05:41,127 --> 00:05:42,606
Absolutely.

38
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:03,635
(Door opens)

39
00:06:05,607 --> 00:06:07,484
- Can I help you?
- Oh!

40
00:06:07,527 --> 00:06:10,758
Agnieszka, you are such a fool.

41
00:06:10,807 --> 00:06:12,638
I am looking for... number nine?

42
00:06:12,687 --> 00:06:14,484
This is six.

43
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,961
So sorry, my dear, for my intrusion.

44
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:23,845
You are, er, come to follow the labours
of Lord Boynton?

45
00:06:23,887 --> 00:06:25,240
Yes, he's my stepfather.

46
00:06:25,287 --> 00:06:27,164
Truly, God has smiled upon you.

47
00:06:28,047 --> 00:06:31,881
Your stepfather does a great thing, I think.
A great man.

48
00:06:50,407 --> 00:06:54,480
(Loud chatter, car horn beeps)

49
00:07:03,607 --> 00:07:05,802
- Oh!
- (Car horn)

50
00:07:20,047 --> 00:07:23,676
(American accent) So I may remain
assured of your very best services?

51
00:07:23,727 --> 00:07:25,319
Thank you very much, sir.

52
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:27,885
Americans.

53
00:07:27,927 --> 00:07:30,282
Do know how to arrive, hm?

54
00:07:31,887 --> 00:07:34,447
(Man) Silly little man!

55
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:37,285
- Please!
- Look here...

56
00:07:37,327 --> 00:07:39,966
- Do you know who I am?
- (Protesting in Arabic) Pay fare!

57
00:07:40,007 --> 00:07:42,840
I am the son of Lord Boynton.

58
00:07:43,847 --> 00:07:46,486
Son of Lord, you pay, please.

59
00:07:47,887 --> 00:07:49,115
Thank you, sir.

60
00:07:50,407 --> 00:07:52,318
(Speaks Arabic)

61
00:07:55,607 --> 00:07:57,438
Bloody shambles!

62
00:07:57,487 --> 00:07:59,603
Typical. If you...

63
00:08:00,407 --> 00:08:02,159
- (Snores)
- (Sighs)

64
00:08:10,327 --> 00:08:12,682
<i>- (Boy) It was an accident.
- (Child crying)</i>

65
00:08:13,607 --> 00:08:16,883
<i>(Child wailing)</i>

66
00:08:27,767 --> 00:08:30,964
(Woman screaming)

67
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:35,564
(Panting)

68
00:08:35,607 --> 00:08:38,883
Jinny... It's all right, honey.

69
00:08:38,927 --> 00:08:40,679
It's all right now.

70
00:08:41,207 --> 00:08:42,925
I was being drowned.

71
00:08:42,967 --> 00:08:45,765
It was a dream, baby,
it was just a dream.

72
00:08:45,807 --> 00:08:47,798
It was a memory!

73
00:08:54,207 --> 00:08:56,482
I can't go on like this.

74
00:09:00,687 --> 00:09:02,484
(Man shouting)

75
00:09:07,607 --> 00:09:09,484
(Knock on door)

76
00:09:09,527 --> 00:09:11,119
Twelve minutes.

77
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,727
- You allowed me to oversleep...
- Mother...

78
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:15,405
...by twelve minutes!
- I'm sorry.

79
00:09:15,447 --> 00:09:16,721
Fetch my stick.

80
00:09:18,087 --> 00:09:19,918
Stick!

81
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:33,678
(Chatter)

82
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,845
Ah, excellent. There you are.

83
00:09:46,047 --> 00:09:47,924
It's Leonard.

84
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:49,958
Boynton. Your stepson.

85
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:52,475
How good of you to come,
Mr Boynton.

86
00:09:52,527 --> 00:09:54,995
- Carol, my vitamins.
- Now, Mother?

87
00:09:55,047 --> 00:09:56,196
Clearly.

88
00:09:58,087 --> 00:10:00,203
Jinny, you look like you're suffering
from consumption.

89
00:10:00,247 --> 00:10:05,367
That's drawing attention to yourself in
the most unattractive way. Apply colour!

90
00:10:05,407 --> 00:10:07,602
Raymond... Don't sit there, sit here.

91
00:10:08,447 --> 00:10:11,962
Nanny... Go somewhere else.

92
00:10:13,407 --> 00:10:15,602
You look tired, dear.

93
00:10:20,647 --> 00:10:22,922
We need to discuss your attitude.

94
00:10:22,967 --> 00:10:27,836
Sulking is like shyness.
It is unacceptable, it is showing off.

95
00:10:27,887 --> 00:10:30,321
I'm not sulking, Mother.

96
00:10:30,367 --> 00:10:34,918
I merely question the wisdom of travelling
when the market is jittery.

97
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:38,357
Wall Street knows better than to breathe
without consulting me,

98
00:10:38,407 --> 00:10:40,682
wherever I may be at whatever juncture.

99
00:10:40,727 --> 00:10:42,763
I forgot my book. Fetch my book.

100
00:10:50,007 --> 00:10:53,886
You think they're a rum crew, wait till
you meet the archaeologist husband.

101
00:10:53,927 --> 00:10:58,842
Although he's not actually psychotic,
just old-fashioned bonkers.

102
00:11:00,087 --> 00:11:02,726
Theodore Gerard. We have met.

103
00:11:02,767 --> 00:11:03,995
Bonce doctor.

104
00:11:04,047 --> 00:11:06,083
I advised on a case in Edinburgh.
Used to have a beard?

105
00:11:06,127 --> 00:11:08,322
Oh. Yes, of course.

106
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,278
The bonce doctor!

107
00:11:10,327 --> 00:11:13,399
- I recognise you, monsieur.
- Of course, it's all a sham.

108
00:11:14,487 --> 00:11:20,596
The real object of the exercise...
is a reconciliation of his offspring and hers.

109
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:23,639
- Happy families among the tombs.
- There is disharmony?

110
00:11:23,687 --> 00:11:29,319
Where Lady Boynton is, the Music of
the Spheres is like nails down a blackboard.

111
00:11:29,367 --> 00:11:32,643
Now, you must excuse me
my personal disorder...

112
00:11:33,207 --> 00:11:36,882
Can't help sticking my face
down the stupid lion's throat.

113
00:11:39,487 --> 00:11:41,921
Do you mind if I join you?

114
00:11:49,447 --> 00:11:51,085
(Sighs)

115
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:54,756
I can't find these wretched pills.
Oh God, Raymond.

116
00:11:56,167 --> 00:11:57,395
She has them.

117
00:11:59,767 --> 00:12:01,246
What?

118
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:04,484
She has them already,
they're in her bag.

119
00:12:05,687 --> 00:12:08,963
The book she sent me to find,
she didn't even bring to Syria.

120
00:12:09,727 --> 00:12:14,437
Carol, we know these games.

121
00:12:14,487 --> 00:12:17,285
One day, Raymond...
I swear to God...

122
00:12:17,327 --> 00:12:19,966
- I know.
- I will take a hammer and I swear...

123
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:22,282
Maybe we should talk about that.

124
00:12:25,127 --> 00:12:27,357
- Don't joke with me, Ray.
- I'm your brother.

125
00:12:29,407 --> 00:12:31,318
I never joke.

126
00:12:37,887 --> 00:12:40,355
(Call to prayer)

127
00:12:49,207 --> 00:12:52,165
(Raymond) The way we let that woman
steal them from us.

128
00:12:52,207 --> 00:12:56,723
(Carol) Oh, God, Raymond.
We have no choice.

129
00:12:56,767 --> 00:12:58,758
(Raymond) She has to die.

130
00:13:00,367 --> 00:13:02,085
(Traders calling out)

131
00:13:25,287 --> 00:13:27,847
(Man speaking Arabic)

132
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:39,324
Now, we're going now!
Please! Please!

133
00:13:43,127 --> 00:13:45,004
Yes, sir. Please, please, please.

134
00:13:45,047 --> 00:13:48,244
Tickety-boo. Please. This way. OK, OK.

135
00:13:51,367 --> 00:13:54,006
(Speaking Arabic)

136
00:14:18,527 --> 00:14:23,043
Whoo! Looks like Lord Boynton's expedition
has created quite a stir.

137
00:14:23,087 --> 00:14:25,647
Apart from the family
and a three-line whip...

138
00:14:26,927 --> 00:14:31,318
Dr King joins us, I suspect, because
she stuck a pin in a map of the world.

139
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:34,279
Mr Jefferson Cope
may actually be a little bit dull.

140
00:14:34,327 --> 00:14:38,206
He might possibly like old bits of bone
and pot and whatnot.

141
00:14:38,247 --> 00:14:41,876
The honourable Leonard, stuck with
running his father's house in Dorset,

142
00:14:41,927 --> 00:14:47,001
on no income, while said father
swans around the Middle East

143
00:14:47,047 --> 00:14:49,277
looking for the head of John the Baptist.

144
00:14:49,327 --> 00:14:52,797
As for the Polish nun, she gives me
the heebie-jeebies personally.

145
00:15:01,207 --> 00:15:02,765
(Shouting in Arabic)

146
00:15:05,247 --> 00:15:07,283
No problem, no problem.

147
00:15:07,327 --> 00:15:08,965
Don't be afraid. No problem.

148
00:15:09,007 --> 00:15:11,043
(Shouting in Arabic)

149
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:27,958
No problem, no problem.
(Speaking Arabic)

150
00:15:42,047 --> 00:15:43,685
(Camel grunts)

151
00:15:55,327 --> 00:15:59,115
Hm. What have we here, I wonder?
A mobile toll-booth?

152
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,203
Dame Celia Westholme.

153
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,999
Sorry to hold up the bus, everybody.
Camel's on loan,

154
00:16:13,047 --> 00:16:14,765
had to go back.

155
00:16:18,647 --> 00:16:21,923
Has Boynton made any significant
progress? Does anybody know?

156
00:16:32,567 --> 00:16:35,320
- Have you read any of her books?
- Oui.

157
00:16:35,367 --> 00:16:38,962
It's her fault I'm here.
She makes travel sound so thrilling.

158
00:16:39,007 --> 00:16:40,679
Ah.

159
00:16:53,967 --> 00:16:57,437
(Shouting in Arabic)

160
00:17:03,727 --> 00:17:07,083
Welcome, welcome, welcome.
Did you have a nice journey?

161
00:17:08,087 --> 00:17:11,841
I know, it's ghastly, isn't it?
Hello, little blossoms.

162
00:17:13,127 --> 00:17:16,278
Hot showers and cold beer for everyone.

163
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:20,764
Even you, Nanny,
you raving old dipsomaniac.

164
00:17:21,367 --> 00:17:23,403
- Leonard, dear boy!
- Father.

165
00:17:25,687 --> 00:17:30,556
Ah. My child bride.

166
00:17:32,727 --> 00:17:36,800
Dinner's in the pavilion at eight.
Everyone's invited.

167
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:39,520
Come along! Raymond.

168
00:17:40,047 --> 00:17:43,926
Utter bonanza of crippled personalities.
I'd have paid extra for this.

169
00:17:52,207 --> 00:17:54,163
(Distant shouting)

170
00:18:08,207 --> 00:18:10,198
(Operatic singing on radio)

171
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:56,997
(Shouting)

172
00:18:58,647 --> 00:19:01,923
Making yourself useful, Leonard?
Good man!

173
00:19:01,967 --> 00:19:04,435
Coming along!

174
00:19:04,487 --> 00:19:07,160
That blind chap down in the Arab camp,

175
00:19:07,207 --> 00:19:10,643
every night I hear him tell a variation
on the same story.

176
00:19:10,687 --> 00:19:13,247
I've heard it all over Syria.

177
00:19:13,287 --> 00:19:18,998
The daughter of Herodius brought
John the Baptist's severed head to this land.

178
00:19:19,047 --> 00:19:22,676
She buried it where the river
meets the mountain.

179
00:19:24,527 --> 00:19:27,200
Now, I've been every damn place
in Syria

180
00:19:27,247 --> 00:19:32,685
where any river meets anything that could
possibly be construed as a mountain,

181
00:19:32,727 --> 00:19:34,365
from Krak to Aleppo.

182
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:37,524
This is the only place left.
It has to be here!

183
00:19:38,527 --> 00:19:41,166
Come along then. Chop-chop.

184
00:20:06,407 --> 00:20:08,204
Ah...

185
00:20:20,407 --> 00:20:24,195
And these words...
Do they speak of John?

186
00:20:24,247 --> 00:20:27,717
No. It tells a different story.

187
00:20:29,487 --> 00:20:32,797
A man is sitting in a tavern in Damascus.

188
00:20:32,847 --> 00:20:38,240
He looks up from his wine and sees Death
staring at him across the room.

189
00:20:39,007 --> 00:20:42,477
He cries out, "But this cannot be my time!"

190
00:20:43,047 --> 00:20:46,676
He flees Damascus,
he rides his horse fast,

191
00:20:46,727 --> 00:20:49,321
right across the desert to Samarra.

192
00:20:49,767 --> 00:20:52,759
<i>When he arrives, he's thirsty.</i>

193
00:20:53,327 --> 00:20:55,716
Standing before him at the well...

194
00:20:55,767 --> 00:20:57,359
is Death.

195
00:20:57,407 --> 00:20:58,999
Hm.

196
00:20:59,047 --> 00:21:01,242
You're nodding.

197
00:21:01,287 --> 00:21:06,281
On seeing Death for the second time,
the man cries out, "This cannot be!

198
00:21:07,127 --> 00:21:09,083
"For I escaped you in Damascus."

199
00:21:13,527 --> 00:21:17,725
And Death, he lays his hand
upon the shoulder of the man

200
00:21:17,767 --> 00:21:22,397
and says, "I also was surprised
to see you..."

201
00:21:26,607 --> 00:21:28,325
"...to see you in Damascus...

202
00:21:30,527 --> 00:21:36,124
"for my appointment with you,
it was always to be here in Samarra."

203
00:21:37,807 --> 00:21:40,196
Try as one might,

204
00:21:40,247 --> 00:21:43,956
one cannot escape
one's rightful destiny.

205
00:21:44,007 --> 00:21:45,201
Oui.

206
00:21:48,967 --> 00:21:51,800
I know you're here, Johnny.

207
00:21:52,327 --> 00:21:54,443
I can almost smell you.

208
00:22:09,647 --> 00:22:11,524
Sugar, Raymond?

209
00:22:12,567 --> 00:22:15,718
To put sugar in one's tea
is indicative of weak character.

210
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,598
Raymond doesn't take sugar.

211
00:22:25,487 --> 00:22:27,523
Oh, good morning.
You look dreadful.

212
00:22:28,407 --> 00:22:31,285
- Thank you. I feel dreadful.
- You should see a doctor.

213
00:22:31,327 --> 00:22:35,081
- I just did. He told me I had malaria.
- Oh, Lord!

214
00:22:35,127 --> 00:22:37,800
I dosed myself up,
as much as it makes a difference.

215
00:22:37,847 --> 00:22:41,476
You shan't come
on the expedition today?

216
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:44,041
If I have an attack on the way to the river,

217
00:22:44,087 --> 00:22:46,282
I'll most probably die.

218
00:22:46,327 --> 00:22:50,081
The obvious solution is to remain here
all day with Lady Boynton.

219
00:22:51,127 --> 00:22:53,595
- Better come with us.
- Not a difficult decision.

220
00:22:53,647 --> 00:22:58,323
The sun is up. I shall spend today
observing from the platform.

221
00:22:58,367 --> 00:23:01,439
Good idea, poppet.
Cracking view of the Kasbah.

222
00:23:01,487 --> 00:23:04,285
You can keep a beady one
on Leonard and myself.

223
00:23:04,327 --> 00:23:06,716
You assist with the digging, monsieur?

224
00:23:06,767 --> 00:23:09,725
Oh, I would assist with digging the drains

225
00:23:09,767 --> 00:23:12,520
if the alternative were enforced
social intercourse

226
00:23:12,567 --> 00:23:15,764
with my father's ghastly ten-ton wife.

227
00:23:15,807 --> 00:23:19,004
You won't come down to the river,
Lady Boynton?

228
00:23:19,047 --> 00:23:22,756
By all accounts, the vista of the Kasbah
is very fine.

229
00:23:22,807 --> 00:23:25,765
- The boy bring my Times yet?
- No, Mother.

230
00:23:25,807 --> 00:23:27,399
Dismiss him!

231
00:23:31,167 --> 00:23:33,556
- (Slap)
- Sorry, might have stung.

232
00:23:33,607 --> 00:23:36,167
Ah! I am stung!

233
00:23:37,047 --> 00:23:38,765
Yes, there's the bugger there.

234
00:23:40,647 --> 00:23:43,241
Goodness, let me look at you.

235
00:23:43,847 --> 00:23:45,485
Don't touch me!

236
00:23:45,527 --> 00:23:47,358
Never touch me!

237
00:24:10,127 --> 00:24:12,197
You're always looking at me.

238
00:24:12,247 --> 00:24:13,839
Golly, am I?

239
00:24:13,887 --> 00:24:15,559
All the time.

240
00:24:15,607 --> 00:24:19,236
I turn round and you're
just looking at me. Why?

241
00:24:21,087 --> 00:24:23,362
Perhaps I like the shape of your face.

242
00:24:23,407 --> 00:24:26,240
It's a very pretty face.
Do you mind?

243
00:24:26,287 --> 00:24:29,643
I certainly shan't do it if you mind.

244
00:24:30,367 --> 00:24:31,356
I don't mind.

245
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:36,920
(Poirot) S'il vous plaît, Monsieur Cope.
Do not allow Poirot to detain you.

246
00:24:36,967 --> 00:24:38,923
Oh, I'm in no hurry.

247
00:24:38,967 --> 00:24:43,165
The place has been there a few years,
it's not going anywhere,

248
00:24:43,207 --> 00:24:45,675
You are acquainted with
the family Boynton?

249
00:24:46,247 --> 00:24:50,126
One can't live in New York and fail
to be acquainted with the Boyntons.

250
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:54,080
Lady B is a pretty big financial noise.
I like her.

251
00:24:54,127 --> 00:24:58,757
If I may say so, monsieur, it seems
your amitiè is not reciprocated.

252
00:24:58,807 --> 00:25:00,684
Oh, she hates everybody.

253
00:25:00,727 --> 00:25:03,924
Everybody knows that,
she just doesn't give a damn.

254
00:25:03,967 --> 00:25:08,483
- I think it's quite stylish.
- You have the outlook most benevolent.

255
00:25:08,527 --> 00:25:10,199
I'm easily pleased.

256
00:25:12,767 --> 00:25:15,327
(Sarah) Out in the sun yet again
without a hat.

257
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:18,403
(Raymond) Some people never learn.

258
00:25:19,647 --> 00:25:23,401
(Carol) Raymond, let me read you
what Mr Baedeker has to say.

259
00:25:23,447 --> 00:25:27,156
"The monumental edifice knows as..."
Excuse me!

260
00:25:27,207 --> 00:25:29,437
Thank you so much.

261
00:25:33,327 --> 00:25:35,318
I thought that free from the mother

262
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,484
I might be permitted some conversation
with Raymond.

263
00:25:38,527 --> 00:25:42,805
But no. Evidently the family
has decided I'm a gold-digger,

264
00:25:42,847 --> 00:25:44,724
and all overtures of friendship
must be stamped on.

265
00:25:44,767 --> 00:25:48,282
Frankly it's rather insulting.
I'm not having it.

266
00:25:51,927 --> 00:25:56,239
Ladies and gentlemen,
now we may rest.

267
00:25:56,967 --> 00:25:59,845
We have arrived. (Speaks Arabic)

268
00:26:07,007 --> 00:26:10,204
(Agnieszka) God is good.
God is glorious.

269
00:26:28,727 --> 00:26:31,116
If you want my professional opinion,
which you don't,

270
00:26:31,167 --> 00:26:33,840
but you should, so I'm gonna give it
to you anyway,

271
00:26:33,887 --> 00:26:37,357
your family would do well to hear
what Herr Freud said to me last year.

272
00:26:37,407 --> 00:26:41,525
"To be American is bad enough,"
he said, "but to put money..."

273
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:43,478
(Mutters)

274
00:26:43,527 --> 00:26:45,324
Oh! Let me look at you.

275
00:26:46,127 --> 00:26:47,879
I'll be fine. I'll be... fine.

276
00:26:47,927 --> 00:26:50,395
This gentleman needs
to return to camp immediately.

277
00:26:50,447 --> 00:26:55,521
Get your hands off me, I'll be fine!
Doctors! Think you know everything?

278
00:26:55,567 --> 00:26:57,558
(Sarah) You're too hot.

279
00:26:57,607 --> 00:27:00,405
(Gerard) You don't have to... carry me.

280
00:27:00,967 --> 00:27:03,401
- Jinny!
- That's my name!

281
00:27:04,887 --> 00:27:07,720
(Gerard) I just need a drink of water.

282
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:33,076
I can hear the gears grinding
in the old cerebellum.

283
00:27:33,127 --> 00:27:34,765
Not really.

284
00:27:34,807 --> 00:27:37,640
I was just wondering how Lady Boynton

285
00:27:37,687 --> 00:27:41,680
managed to negotiate that ladder affair,
it's pretty vertiginous.

286
00:27:41,727 --> 00:27:43,524
Would it kill you to call her "Mother"?

287
00:27:45,047 --> 00:27:46,958
For me.

288
00:27:47,007 --> 00:27:48,998
Stepmother would do.

289
00:27:51,727 --> 00:27:53,445
(Leonard) God, it's hot.

290
00:27:53,487 --> 00:27:54,715
Yes, it is.

291
00:27:54,767 --> 00:27:59,761
Perhaps you would be kind enough to take
the lady in question a glass of water.

292
00:27:59,807 --> 00:28:05,006
Father, look, I'm sorry, but are you
genuinely blind to the way she treats...

293
00:28:05,047 --> 00:28:07,800
everyone, except you?

294
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:10,524
Now!

295
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,284
I say!

296
00:28:22,327 --> 00:28:24,363
Would you like a drink?

297
00:28:26,007 --> 00:28:28,760
Can we get you anything at all?
To drink?

298
00:28:30,647 --> 00:28:32,683
(Quietly) Like a bucket of strychnine.

299
00:28:40,567 --> 00:28:42,478
Get these buggers away from me!

300
00:28:44,487 --> 00:28:46,478
I'm perfectly well.

301
00:28:46,527 --> 00:28:48,643
Lie down.

302
00:28:52,007 --> 00:28:55,682
- Ah...
- Doctor, what do we do?

303
00:28:55,727 --> 00:28:57,604
What did he say?

304
00:28:57,647 --> 00:28:59,717
He said bugger off.

305
00:28:59,767 --> 00:29:02,918
Oh. (Chuckles)
Right you are. Can do.

306
00:29:02,967 --> 00:29:04,480
Not you.

307
00:29:06,167 --> 00:29:08,158
You stay.

308
00:29:32,007 --> 00:29:35,158
- No, Jinny.
- Oh, God. I thought...

309
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:37,118
- Yeah.
- I thought you wanted my company.

310
00:29:37,167 --> 00:29:40,477
I do, yes. That's exactly what I want.

311
00:29:40,527 --> 00:29:44,839
Listen to me, it's not... you.

312
00:29:44,887 --> 00:29:47,879
It's not about a conquest.

313
00:29:50,887 --> 00:29:53,321
For me, denial...

314
00:29:53,367 --> 00:29:58,202
is a very... particular pleasure.

315
00:30:00,927 --> 00:30:03,316
It's not... (Sighs)

316
00:30:12,007 --> 00:30:13,838
(Music on gramophone)

317
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:42,607
People say travel broadens the mind.

318
00:30:42,647 --> 00:30:46,720
Mainly because people like me
insist on it in their books.

319
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:51,356
But I have to say I doubt that it is true.

320
00:30:51,407 --> 00:30:55,082
On the contrary. I suspect travel
narrows the mind.

321
00:30:56,407 --> 00:30:59,524
One becomes so blasè
about the wonders of the world.

322
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:02,365
The more I travel the more clearly
I understand that...

323
00:31:03,407 --> 00:31:05,477
all that ever matters is the people.

324
00:31:07,007 --> 00:31:09,123
Not the places.

325
00:31:10,087 --> 00:31:13,523
Those Arabs, telling stories
over couscous in the camp.

326
00:31:13,567 --> 00:31:15,478
They fascinate me.

327
00:31:15,527 --> 00:31:21,602
This, it's pretty enough,
but show me the humans every time.

328
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:27,162
I don't much care for her.

329
00:31:28,407 --> 00:31:31,205
The way she hangs around
the younger Boynton girl.

330
00:31:33,087 --> 00:31:37,558
They sniff out weakness, nuns,
and misery, and they gorge on it.

331
00:31:37,607 --> 00:31:40,201
Bloody vampires in drag,
quite frankly.

332
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:45,643
(Men shouting, distant)

333
00:31:55,567 --> 00:31:58,718
Poirot! How did you find the river?

334
00:31:58,767 --> 00:32:00,405
- Oh, I...
- Good, good.

335
00:32:00,447 --> 00:32:05,237
We haven't turned up any glories here,
but we live in hope.

336
00:32:05,287 --> 00:32:08,006
Nil carborundum, and all that.

337
00:32:08,047 --> 00:32:10,197
And Lady Boynton,
she has enjoyed her day?

338
00:32:10,247 --> 00:32:13,796
Oh, yes, monsieur.
Of course, she always does.

339
00:32:13,847 --> 00:32:16,759
The word "boredom"
is simply not in the vocab.

340
00:32:17,967 --> 00:32:19,605
Darling!

341
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:24,118
I think it's time you climbed down
from your perch for a martini.

342
00:32:24,167 --> 00:32:28,160
Poppet? Shall we say
about ten minutes?

343
00:32:28,207 --> 00:32:30,960
You little minx. (Chuckles)

344
00:32:45,527 --> 00:32:47,245
(Sighs)

345
00:32:48,047 --> 00:32:49,639
(Greville) Help!

346
00:32:49,687 --> 00:32:51,518
Help!

347
00:32:51,567 --> 00:32:55,321
Et alors. Ça commence.

348
00:33:04,367 --> 00:33:05,959
(Greville) Help!

349
00:33:06,007 --> 00:33:08,760
(Commotion outside)

350
00:33:39,527 --> 00:33:41,518
- Are you the girl who's a doctor?
- Yes.

351
00:33:41,567 --> 00:33:44,400
Then you've met death. So have I.
Come on.

352
00:34:09,167 --> 00:34:12,045
Shut her eyes. Shut them.

353
00:34:21,487 --> 00:34:23,125
I'm afraid it's true.

354
00:34:23,167 --> 00:34:24,395
She's dead.

355
00:34:36,887 --> 00:34:38,923
Your appointment with death,
madame.

356
00:34:40,687 --> 00:34:43,042
It was always to be here.

357
00:35:14,567 --> 00:35:17,445
Et maintenant, mon Colonel,
you are arrived.

358
00:35:17,487 --> 00:35:20,285
This is an event
for which you were prepared. Non?

359
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:22,887
No. This is something else. Later.

360
00:35:22,927 --> 00:35:24,838
Show me the dead woman.

361
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:45,644
What happened here?

362
00:35:45,687 --> 00:35:49,123
Excusez-moi, but do you commission
me to examine this case?

363
00:35:50,687 --> 00:35:51,836
I do.

364
00:35:51,887 --> 00:35:55,675
You two getting married or something?
Mind if I have a gander at your patient?

365
00:35:55,727 --> 00:35:58,560
- Are you recovered, Doctor?
- I'll manage.

366
00:35:58,607 --> 00:36:01,565
Juicy big hole where there
shouldn't be one. Somebody's stuck her.

367
00:36:01,607 --> 00:36:03,916
- Mm, a knife.
- Bigger than a knife.

368
00:36:03,967 --> 00:36:05,195
Fatter blade.

369
00:36:05,247 --> 00:36:08,045
- Chisel?
- Chisel fits the bill.

370
00:36:10,127 --> 00:36:12,846
Whatever the implement,
it was wielded with authority.

371
00:36:12,887 --> 00:36:16,800
One blow in, then vigorously churned about
to create maximum damage.

372
00:36:17,167 --> 00:36:20,398
She can't have been dead
for more than an hour.

373
00:36:20,447 --> 00:36:22,881
Yes. I don't know
why that should be there.

374
00:36:28,007 --> 00:36:29,520
It is wax.

375
00:36:29,567 --> 00:36:32,798
Well, one thing's for certain.
She can't stay here in this heat.

376
00:36:32,847 --> 00:36:36,396
I'll make arrangements
for the body to be transported.

377
00:36:36,447 --> 00:36:38,597
Un moment, s'il vous plaît,
mon Colonel.

378
00:36:38,647 --> 00:36:41,081
- Excusez-moi.
- Yes.

379
00:36:43,007 --> 00:36:45,441
Already there is so much about this case
that is wrong.

380
00:36:45,487 --> 00:36:48,763
You, yourself are wrong.
You are not what you appear.

381
00:36:48,807 --> 00:36:49,876
You are not a policeman,

382
00:36:49,927 --> 00:36:52,999
yet you know a crime has been
committed before it had been reported.

383
00:36:53,047 --> 00:36:56,039
You bear the rank of Colonel,
yet where is it mon ami that you serve?

384
00:36:56,087 --> 00:36:58,362
So enough of these crypticities.

385
00:36:58,407 --> 00:37:02,764
Explain yourself to Poirot
or he cannot accept this case. Point.

386
00:37:02,807 --> 00:37:05,037
- Crypticities?
- Oui.

387
00:37:05,087 --> 00:37:07,476
Poirot, you're a foreigner.

388
00:37:07,527 --> 00:37:10,917
But I judge you to be a good egg,
and therefore trustworthy.

389
00:37:10,967 --> 00:37:12,685
What I'm about to deal you now

390
00:37:12,727 --> 00:37:15,799
is a card you must keep
very close to your chest.

391
00:37:15,847 --> 00:37:17,803
Is that understood?

392
00:37:17,847 --> 00:37:19,166
Oui.

393
00:37:58,887 --> 00:38:01,242
You continue with the digging,
monsieur?

394
00:38:01,287 --> 00:38:05,166
I am given to understand it's what
Lady Boynton would have wanted.

395
00:38:05,207 --> 00:38:09,359
You were, I think...
Please to forgive me...

396
00:38:09,407 --> 00:38:11,204
...somewhere in this area
this afternoon?

397
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:15,525
Poirot, could you postpone your interrogation
of the obvious murder suspect

398
00:38:15,567 --> 00:38:20,083
so he can arrange some necessities for
his distressed father? Thank you so much.

399
00:38:23,087 --> 00:38:24,759
Oh!

400
00:38:24,807 --> 00:38:27,037
I understand you're looking for
a chisel, yes?

401
00:38:28,207 --> 00:38:29,196
Fill your boots.

402
00:39:21,367 --> 00:39:24,882
(Celia reading in Arabic)

403
00:39:43,607 --> 00:39:48,203
Dame Celia. Lord Boynton.
What is it that you read?

404
00:39:48,247 --> 00:39:52,843
I'm cheering the bereaved with judicious
extracts from The Perfumed Garden.

405
00:39:52,887 --> 00:39:55,924
Are people saying
that I killed my wife?

406
00:39:55,967 --> 00:39:58,527
Non. Non, monsieur.

407
00:39:58,567 --> 00:40:01,798
We are all united in our desire
to comfort you.

408
00:40:03,607 --> 00:40:07,043
I was always glad that I was older
than Leonora.

409
00:40:07,087 --> 00:40:11,080
I thought at least... l'll die first.

410
00:40:12,367 --> 00:40:15,882
I won't have the agony
of trying to live without her.

411
00:40:22,487 --> 00:40:25,559
Nevertheless, it must
be admitted the death of Lady B

412
00:40:25,607 --> 00:40:27,404
is hardly detrimental
to the community.

413
00:40:27,447 --> 00:40:31,360
It is not well, monsieur, that a human
should die before her time it is come.

414
00:40:31,407 --> 00:40:34,001
En plus, the nanny Madame
Taylor has the great distress.

415
00:40:34,047 --> 00:40:35,958
All right, all right, keep your hair on.

416
00:40:36,007 --> 00:40:38,999
For heaven's sake,
I was just trying to lighten the mood.

417
00:40:41,287 --> 00:40:43,881
How did you achieve your newspaper,
Monsieur Cope?

418
00:40:43,927 --> 00:40:44,996
Came with me.

419
00:40:45,047 --> 00:40:46,605
Many thanks.

420
00:40:46,647 --> 00:40:50,845
I'm just lousy at being intrepid.
Always so hungry for news of home.

421
00:40:50,887 --> 00:40:53,799
Back at the hotel you couldn't
get a paper for love nor money.

422
00:40:53,847 --> 00:40:55,246
(Gerard) I know.

423
00:41:07,327 --> 00:41:09,602
This may help you in times of stress.

424
00:41:09,647 --> 00:41:11,444
Mon Colonel.

425
00:41:13,127 --> 00:41:15,277
Your men.
When is it that they arrive?

426
00:41:15,327 --> 00:41:18,285
- Midnight, I should think.
- Hm.

427
00:41:18,327 --> 00:41:20,887
Then you must have them
search this area at dawn.

428
00:41:20,927 --> 00:41:23,122
The search most diligent. All around.

429
00:41:23,167 --> 00:41:24,361
Looking for what?

430
00:41:24,407 --> 00:41:26,762
In the first place, mon ami, a syringe.

431
00:41:26,807 --> 00:41:30,436
It is instrumental
in the murder of Lady Boynton.

432
00:41:30,487 --> 00:41:32,796
Right. Good grief.

433
00:41:32,847 --> 00:41:34,803
- It will be done.
- Bon.

434
00:41:34,847 --> 00:41:37,281
You see, mon ami...

435
00:41:37,327 --> 00:41:40,797
the voices
of the little grey cells.

436
00:41:40,847 --> 00:41:43,315
They have begun to sing to Poirot.

437
00:41:53,607 --> 00:41:55,962
(Chanting prayers)

438
00:42:04,767 --> 00:42:05,995
(lnsects buzzing)

439
00:42:11,287 --> 00:42:13,357
Slit throat.

440
00:42:15,247 --> 00:42:17,124
Je comprends pas.

441
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:21,319
It is not the custom du pays
to waste life and food in this manner?

442
00:42:21,367 --> 00:42:23,244
Barbarous.

443
00:42:30,327 --> 00:42:31,555
Monsieur.

444
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,406
- Monsieur.
- Monsieur.

445
00:42:36,447 --> 00:42:40,725
Look, Poirot,
sorry to be so stand-offish.

446
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,803
Bit grim seeing one's father cry.

447
00:42:42,847 --> 00:42:45,156
Oui. Je vous en prie, monsieur.

448
00:42:46,367 --> 00:42:47,720
What do you want to know?

449
00:42:47,767 --> 00:42:51,282
I should like for you to tell me if you spoke
to your stepmother yesterday afternoon,

450
00:42:51,327 --> 00:42:54,603
- and if so, when?
- Er, we spoke...

451
00:42:54,647 --> 00:42:57,719
about one o'clock, hottest part of the day.

452
00:42:57,767 --> 00:42:58,916
Bon.

453
00:42:58,967 --> 00:43:02,516
She'd been perched up there
like some evil great pudding

454
00:43:02,567 --> 00:43:04,478
ever since you lot set off.

455
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:09,637
I say we spoke. I spoke.

456
00:43:10,327 --> 00:43:11,999
She ignored me.

457
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:13,446
Nothing unusual about that.

458
00:43:13,487 --> 00:43:16,524
Can we get you anything at all?
To drink?

459
00:43:16,567 --> 00:43:20,958
You know how it was. One mustn't
disturb her when she was taking the sun,

460
00:43:21,007 --> 00:43:24,522
but... God help you
if you neglected to do so.

461
00:43:25,607 --> 00:43:26,676
- Monsieur.
- Oui.

462
00:43:26,727 --> 00:43:28,524
- We found this syringe.
- Ah.

463
00:43:28,567 --> 00:43:32,003
- Where was this discovered?
- In the tent occupied by the old lady.

464
00:43:32,047 --> 00:43:33,765
The nanny.

465
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:37,239
Merci.

466
00:43:47,807 --> 00:43:50,958
(Agnieszka) "And the Lord said
unto the servant:

467
00:43:51,007 --> 00:43:56,718
"Go out into the highways
and compel them to come in to my feast..."

468
00:43:57,407 --> 00:43:59,637
(Jinny) "...that my house
may be filled."

469
00:44:00,687 --> 00:44:02,359
It's a beautiful parable.

470
00:44:02,407 --> 00:44:05,683
(Agnieszka) The word King James
renders as "compel"

471
00:44:05,727 --> 00:44:08,685
is in the Greek "anankadzo".

472
00:44:08,727 --> 00:44:12,436
It means compel with violence.

473
00:44:12,487 --> 00:44:14,364
The Spanish knew this.

474
00:44:14,407 --> 00:44:18,764
They used this single word to justify
every atrocity of their Inquisition.

475
00:44:20,047 --> 00:44:22,038
For it is God's own command

476
00:44:22,087 --> 00:44:25,124
that those unwilling to enter
His Kingdom

477
00:44:25,167 --> 00:44:27,237
should be persuaded in with pain.

478
00:44:27,287 --> 00:44:28,606
That's terrible.

479
00:44:30,327 --> 00:44:32,443
Compulsion of any kind, my dear.

480
00:44:32,487 --> 00:44:34,921
It can be terrible.

481
00:44:35,687 --> 00:44:39,396
(Jinny) I overheard my stepfather
telling the story that was written here.

482
00:44:39,447 --> 00:44:42,007
Of Death following the man
across the desert.

483
00:44:49,607 --> 00:44:54,203
Something has followed me
here to this place. Something evil.

484
00:44:55,447 --> 00:44:57,563
God is here to guard you, Jinny.

485
00:44:58,527 --> 00:45:01,325
He lives in every grain of sand.

486
00:45:07,647 --> 00:45:10,957
(Man speaking in Arabic)

487
00:45:18,687 --> 00:45:20,120
(Other men chant reply)

488
00:45:34,167 --> 00:45:36,840
(Water splashing,
child gasping)

489
00:45:45,607 --> 00:45:49,566
(Music playing faintly on gramophone)

490
00:45:53,927 --> 00:45:55,997
(Carbury) What is it now?

491
00:45:56,767 --> 00:45:57,756
(Music stops)

492
00:45:57,807 --> 00:46:00,275
Sorry gentlemen.
Sand in the grooves.

493
00:46:00,327 --> 00:46:03,205
Quite. Well,
the Arabs are all accounted for.

494
00:46:03,247 --> 00:46:04,965
Oui.

495
00:46:06,647 --> 00:46:09,286
This case, it is most unsatisfactory.

496
00:46:09,327 --> 00:46:12,000
Still plenty of suspects, old boy.

497
00:46:12,047 --> 00:46:14,038
But almost all of them were outside
of the camp

498
00:46:14,087 --> 00:46:15,884
when the murder it was committed.

499
00:46:15,927 --> 00:46:19,966
And this is corroborated
by a witness who is impeccable.

500
00:46:20,007 --> 00:46:22,840
Me. They were with Poirot
all of the time.

501
00:46:22,887 --> 00:46:25,037
Raymond wasn't. He came back.

502
00:46:25,087 --> 00:46:27,203
Bien sûr.
Cela je connais bien. Oui.

503
00:46:27,247 --> 00:46:28,999
Also Lord Boynton and his son.

504
00:46:29,047 --> 00:46:33,040
Yes, yes, and tomorrow we begin
the further interrogations.

505
00:46:35,847 --> 00:46:37,758
That's a queer one.

506
00:46:37,807 --> 00:46:39,877
Without doubt there is more
to Monsieur Cope

507
00:46:39,927 --> 00:46:42,361
than he wishes to be known.

508
00:46:42,407 --> 00:46:46,798
But in that desire, and in this company...
he is not unique.

509
00:46:52,527 --> 00:46:54,916
(Woman screams)

510
00:46:54,967 --> 00:46:57,959
(Overlapping voices)

511
00:46:58,007 --> 00:47:00,726
(Carbury) Off in this direction.

512
00:47:00,767 --> 00:47:04,362
(Raymond) Where did it come from?

513
00:47:04,967 --> 00:47:06,958
Close all those gates down there.

514
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:09,760
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.

515
00:47:09,807 --> 00:47:11,445
(Men shouting in Arabic)

516
00:47:12,607 --> 00:47:14,245
Did you see anyone moving?

517
00:47:14,287 --> 00:47:16,755
No. Where did it come from?

518
00:47:17,807 --> 00:47:19,638
It's got to be something.

519
00:47:21,887 --> 00:47:24,481
(Jinny gasping)

520
00:47:28,167 --> 00:47:29,600
(Carbury) Good Lord.

521
00:47:30,367 --> 00:47:32,642
Get her inside, quickly!

522
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:35,405
(Carol) It's OK.

523
00:47:38,527 --> 00:47:43,965
(Carbury) You men, over here.
Close all the exits!

524
00:47:48,967 --> 00:47:51,720
Don't let anyone leave.

525
00:47:57,967 --> 00:47:59,366
Sister Agnieszka!

526
00:48:00,207 --> 00:48:01,959
Ohh...

527
00:48:03,887 --> 00:48:07,357
- (Sobbing)
- (Carol) It's OK. It's OK.

528
00:48:08,247 --> 00:48:10,556
It's OK. Shh. It's OK.

529
00:48:17,207 --> 00:48:20,756
Everything's going to be OK.
Shh, shh.

530
00:48:21,567 --> 00:48:22,841
Can I help?

531
00:48:25,847 --> 00:48:28,441
(Agnieszka muttering)

532
00:48:28,487 --> 00:48:31,285
It would be useful to know
what she was trying to tell us.

533
00:48:31,327 --> 00:48:33,761
She's not trying to tell us anything.
She's talking to God.

534
00:48:33,807 --> 00:48:35,684
(Poirot) You have Polish?

535
00:48:35,727 --> 00:48:39,436
You don't need Polish to spot a woman
at her prayers. Pretty needlework, Doc.

536
00:48:39,487 --> 00:48:42,206
Shouldn't we be getting her
back to the hotel?

537
00:48:42,247 --> 00:48:45,478
- Ask Dr King.
- You're the senior physician here.

538
00:48:45,527 --> 00:48:48,439
You're much prettier and you're handier
with the cutlery.

539
00:48:48,487 --> 00:48:51,684
Besides, the nun is your patient.
I've got my hands full with the loony nanny.

540
00:48:51,727 --> 00:48:56,243
Well, this, what I've done, it's only temporary.
So yes, we should.

541
00:48:56,287 --> 00:48:59,245
It would be helpful
to Poirot for all of us to return.

542
00:48:59,287 --> 00:49:02,996
- Ei veniam da.
- That's Latin.

543
00:49:03,767 --> 00:49:05,166
"Forgive him"?

544
00:49:05,207 --> 00:49:09,200
Poirot has little Latin, but it can
also be, I think, "Forgive her".

545
00:49:10,207 --> 00:49:12,084
- My men can track...
- Non, non...

546
00:49:12,127 --> 00:49:15,039
There is no need
to despatch your men, Colonel.

547
00:49:15,087 --> 00:49:17,806
The assailant of Sister Agnieszka
has not fled.

548
00:49:20,887 --> 00:49:22,878
There was a man...

549
00:49:24,567 --> 00:49:26,398
He followed me
across the desert.

550
00:49:29,647 --> 00:49:35,358
I woke up and... he was putting a bag
over my head.

551
00:49:35,407 --> 00:49:38,160
Slaver. Bound to be.

552
00:49:38,207 --> 00:49:41,085
People think the slave trade
is finished. It's not.

553
00:49:41,127 --> 00:49:44,244
I've seen the Waiting Cave
on the beach at Mangapwani.

554
00:49:44,287 --> 00:49:48,246
One hundred souls crammed into a space
hardly bigger than this tent.

555
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:51,563
I threw myself on the floor to get away.

556
00:49:53,447 --> 00:49:55,324
When I looked up, I saw...

557
00:49:55,367 --> 00:50:01,761
You saw Sister Agnieszka
struggling with your attacker and...

558
00:50:03,207 --> 00:50:08,281
Well, you tried to help her, and...
you struck at the man with what?

559
00:50:09,327 --> 00:50:10,726
A rock.

560
00:50:10,767 --> 00:50:14,965
Bon. And in your terror,
and in the dark,

561
00:50:15,727 --> 00:50:19,515
accidentally you
struck your friend and protector.

562
00:50:19,567 --> 00:50:23,606
Now, you try to get some sleep,
if you can.

563
00:50:23,647 --> 00:50:27,435
Because tomorrow we face
the rigours of the return journey.

564
00:50:31,407 --> 00:50:33,363
Come close, Jinny.

565
00:50:34,287 --> 00:50:36,278
Let me tell you story.

566
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:41,879
This... is the legend of Gilgamesh.

567
00:51:06,967 --> 00:51:08,844
Oh. Shukran.

568
00:51:17,487 --> 00:51:20,843
Will she be all right? The nun?

569
00:51:20,887 --> 00:51:22,843
Oh, God knows.

570
00:51:23,967 --> 00:51:26,117
Will you?

571
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:27,805
I'm not wounded.

572
00:51:27,847 --> 00:51:29,997
That's debatable.

573
00:51:32,527 --> 00:51:35,246
Seems to be consensus
that you killed your mother.

574
00:51:36,287 --> 00:51:38,755
(Scoffs) Is that your view, Sarah?

575
00:51:38,807 --> 00:51:44,325
Heavens. Five consecutive words,
culminating in my Christian name.

576
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:47,484
If you're going to be this garrulous,
I shall have to ask you to be less familiar.

577
00:51:47,527 --> 00:51:50,200
- Do you think I killed her?
- No.

578
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:53,876
No, but what I think is irrelevant.

579
00:51:53,927 --> 00:51:56,043
He's the one you need to convince.

580
00:51:58,447 --> 00:52:02,201
You're the authority on stories.
Tell me...

581
00:52:04,047 --> 00:52:06,880
what was it that got loose
when Pandora opened the box?

582
00:52:07,607 --> 00:52:09,916
- All the evils of the world.
- That's it.

583
00:52:10,487 --> 00:52:12,478
Mm.

584
00:52:12,527 --> 00:52:15,485
Madness, greed, shame.

585
00:52:15,527 --> 00:52:19,725
Those guys. My stepfather
did pretty much the same thing

586
00:52:20,727 --> 00:52:23,878
when he took the cork out
of that goddamn tomb.

587
00:52:23,927 --> 00:52:26,316
And here you are, Poirot...

588
00:52:27,767 --> 00:52:29,678
kicking the contents all over town.

589
00:52:30,607 --> 00:52:34,520
Did Lady Boynton...
harm you physically?

590
00:52:35,727 --> 00:52:39,720
My mother had little recourse to violence.
She was too smart for that.

591
00:52:39,767 --> 00:52:43,396
Instead, she just prised open
the top of our skulls

592
00:52:43,447 --> 00:52:47,725
and raked her poisonous tongue
through our brains.

593
00:52:47,767 --> 00:52:51,362
No place to hide, Poirot.

594
00:52:52,047 --> 00:52:54,356
Even in your own head.

595
00:52:55,407 --> 00:52:56,681
Ever.

596
00:52:56,727 --> 00:53:01,801
Carol, Carol grew up petrified,
did her best to ingratiate herself,

597
00:53:01,847 --> 00:53:05,157
you know, to win approval,
which she never got.

598
00:53:06,447 --> 00:53:10,725
Jinny just... was terrified to
the point of madness

599
00:53:12,767 --> 00:53:14,758
and possibly beyond.

600
00:53:16,567 --> 00:53:20,116
(Child gasping and choking)

601
00:53:27,247 --> 00:53:29,442
Did you murder your mother,
monsieur?

602
00:53:30,767 --> 00:53:31,836
No.

603
00:53:31,887 --> 00:53:35,323
But only because I lacked
the moral courage.

604
00:53:36,247 --> 00:53:38,442
She was a monster, Poirot.

605
00:53:38,487 --> 00:53:42,526
It was her pleasure,
always, to watch us suffer.

606
00:53:43,567 --> 00:53:46,798
Why was she driven to be so cruel?

607
00:53:46,847 --> 00:53:50,044
- To punish us, I guess.
- For what offence?

608
00:53:50,887 --> 00:53:53,242
For being someone else's kids.

609
00:54:01,087 --> 00:54:05,638
It's true. We were adopted.
All of us.

610
00:54:06,887 --> 00:54:11,005
It is no crime against God or nature
to be an orphan.

611
00:54:11,047 --> 00:54:13,117
Oh, but it is, monsieur.

612
00:54:13,887 --> 00:54:15,206
It is a hideous crime.

613
00:54:16,527 --> 00:54:20,236
Lady Boynton -
Mrs Pierce as she was then -

614
00:54:20,287 --> 00:54:24,405
she wanted to have children so badly.

615
00:54:24,447 --> 00:54:28,520
But between her and Mr Pierce,
they couldn't make it happen.

616
00:54:28,567 --> 00:54:31,718
For Mom, adoption was the only route.

617
00:54:34,007 --> 00:54:38,205
But once she'd assembled her family
of which there were many candidates...

618
00:54:39,327 --> 00:54:41,795
(Raymond crying)

619
00:54:41,847 --> 00:54:44,725
Don't! It was an accident.

620
00:54:44,767 --> 00:54:46,837
(Carol)... and rejected a great number...

621
00:54:46,887 --> 00:54:50,277
(Beating and child crying)

622
00:54:50,807 --> 00:54:52,559
Yes, monsieur,
there were many children

623
00:54:52,607 --> 00:54:56,236
who were presented to us
as new siblings,

624
00:54:56,287 --> 00:54:57,959
only to be removed a day later...

625
00:54:58,007 --> 00:55:00,077
- (Screaming)
- One child stayed longer than the others

626
00:55:00,127 --> 00:55:03,915
but the beatings went on,
until she also disappeared.

627
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:08,722
So there we were, we lucky few.
Raymond, Carol and Jinny.

628
00:55:08,767 --> 00:55:10,280
Je comprends pas.

629
00:55:10,327 --> 00:55:13,603
Mademoiselle
Jinny, she was not even born.

630
00:55:14,967 --> 00:55:17,356
Who was this other child?

631
00:55:17,407 --> 00:55:19,398
I don't know.

632
00:55:20,807 --> 00:55:23,685
I can't remember.

633
00:55:23,727 --> 00:55:25,718
Who was that little girl?

634
00:55:27,727 --> 00:55:28,921
Unacceptable goods.

635
00:55:28,967 --> 00:55:31,242
(Beating and child screaming)

636
00:55:35,047 --> 00:55:37,003
(Knock on door)

637
00:55:45,847 --> 00:55:47,644
Merci.

638
00:55:56,447 --> 00:55:59,200
Who was the child
that you beat, madame?

639
00:56:00,327 --> 00:56:02,318
Can you tell it to Poirot?

640
00:56:13,407 --> 00:56:15,284
Lesley.

641
00:56:15,327 --> 00:56:18,160
Yes. Lesley.

642
00:56:20,487 --> 00:56:24,116
Can you tell to me
about Lesley, Madame?

643
00:56:25,767 --> 00:56:27,883
You had to beat her.

644
00:56:29,287 --> 00:56:30,766
She needed to be punished.

645
00:56:31,687 --> 00:56:34,406
I did what was required...

646
00:56:34,447 --> 00:56:36,039
of me.

647
00:56:36,087 --> 00:56:40,399
(Screaming and crying)

648
00:56:42,327 --> 00:56:44,522
I don't think we're sufficiently sorry.

649
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:46,797
Not by a long chalk.

650
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:49,236
Again, Nanny.

651
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:55,516
<i>(Nanny) God, she was
an evil woman.</i>

652
00:56:56,847 --> 00:57:01,159
And Lesley, madame?
What became of her? She is alive?

653
00:57:02,887 --> 00:57:05,560
Fa... Fa... Father!

654
00:57:05,607 --> 00:57:07,484
I'm not your father, my dear.

655
00:57:08,887 --> 00:57:11,276
But I'll do my best.
Can you get me that bag?

656
00:57:11,327 --> 00:57:13,795
I'll do my best
to make you comfortable.

657
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:15,075
All right?

658
00:57:16,127 --> 00:57:17,845
Thank you.

659
00:57:20,367 --> 00:57:24,326
Bog standard sedative.
Check it if you want, Poirot.

660
00:57:24,367 --> 00:57:26,164
Come on. There's a good girl.

661
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:01,564
Oh, Monsieur Cope.

662
00:58:01,607 --> 00:58:03,006
Monsieur, do you have a moment?

663
00:58:03,047 --> 00:58:05,402
- But of course.
- I, er...

664
00:58:05,447 --> 00:58:07,961
I don't know if this has
any relevance to, er...

665
00:58:08,007 --> 00:58:10,680
what's been going on, but...

666
00:58:10,727 --> 00:58:12,718
it seems
I've lost quite a lot of money.

667
00:58:12,767 --> 00:58:14,758
Monsieur Cope, je suis desolè.

668
00:58:14,807 --> 00:58:16,160
No, no, that's OK.

669
00:58:16,207 --> 00:58:19,040
What's of interest is that
the stock that's gone down the pan

670
00:58:19,087 --> 00:58:21,203
is The Pierce Holding Company.

671
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:24,239
- Non.
- Yes. Lady Boynton's outfit.

672
00:58:24,847 --> 00:58:27,361
Fireproof, bombproof,

673
00:58:27,407 --> 00:58:29,921
the safest bet on Wall Street.

674
00:58:29,967 --> 00:58:32,640
I myself invested substantially.

675
00:58:32,687 --> 00:58:36,680
Seems that there's been this rumour
about the true value of the company.

676
00:58:36,727 --> 00:58:38,843
These things, they come and go.

677
00:58:38,887 --> 00:58:43,563
Lady Boynton'd generally get up on her
hind legs, tell everyone to sit up straight.

678
00:58:43,607 --> 00:58:45,962
It'd all calm down.

679
00:58:46,007 --> 00:58:49,682
But she wasn't there.
The rumour became a panic,

680
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:52,195
then a stampede to get out.

681
00:58:52,247 --> 00:58:54,442
The whole outfit's bust to hell.

682
00:58:54,487 --> 00:58:57,126
The shares are worthless.

683
00:59:07,847 --> 00:59:10,725
(Men shouting)

684
00:59:21,807 --> 00:59:25,686
Oh God, here comes
that ghastly little Belgian,

685
00:59:25,727 --> 00:59:29,959
wringing his hands like the cowman
come to collect his Christmas box.

686
00:59:30,007 --> 00:59:33,397
- He's being respectful, Father.
- He's being a damned nuisance.

687
00:59:33,447 --> 00:59:35,756
Monsieur.

688
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:38,560
Come for a nightcap
among the bereaved?

689
00:59:38,607 --> 00:59:42,759
Non, merci, Lord Boynton,
quand-même.

690
00:59:44,967 --> 00:59:47,401
Oh for God's sake, sit down, Poirot,

691
00:59:47,447 --> 00:59:50,598
you're giving me indigestion,
hovering like that.

692
00:59:50,647 --> 00:59:52,126
Merci.

693
00:59:55,807 --> 00:59:59,436
I suppose it is quite proper
that I should be questioned.

694
00:59:59,487 --> 01:00:01,284
I was on the spot at the time.

695
01:00:01,327 --> 01:00:04,046
And I imagine
I inherit my wife's estate, so...

696
01:00:04,087 --> 01:00:07,966
And the estate of Lady Boynton.
Of what does this principally consist?

697
01:00:08,007 --> 01:00:10,919
God knows.
I never had charge of the money.

698
01:00:10,967 --> 01:00:13,765
Leonora just subbed the digging
as it went along.

699
01:00:13,807 --> 01:00:15,320
Do you know, Leonard?

700
01:00:15,367 --> 01:00:17,597
Raymond would have
a clearer idea of value

701
01:00:17,647 --> 01:00:20,559
but it must add up to a few quid.

702
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:22,757
You disagree, monsieur?

703
01:00:22,807 --> 01:00:27,119
Since we have been in Syria, there has
been the financial collapse catastrophique.

704
01:00:27,927 --> 01:00:31,158
The Pierce Holding Company
is utterly disintegrated.

705
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:34,681
It seems that the death of Lady Boynton
was not enough.

706
01:00:34,727 --> 01:00:37,480
It also seems that...

707
01:00:37,527 --> 01:00:39,597
she has been obliterated
from the earth.

708
01:00:39,647 --> 01:00:41,683
It may surprise you to know,
Mr Poirot,

709
01:00:41,727 --> 01:00:45,686
that I am not unaware that Lady Boynton
was not universally adored.

710
01:00:45,727 --> 01:00:48,036
Like many women
who know their own mind,

711
01:00:48,087 --> 01:00:50,123
she found it all too easy to make enemies.

712
01:00:50,167 --> 01:00:53,159
She did not make an enemy of me.

713
01:00:55,127 --> 01:00:57,243
I loved her.

714
01:00:57,287 --> 01:00:59,881
I am not ashamed to say so

715
01:00:59,927 --> 01:01:01,918
to you or to my son.

716
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:13,206
Was it necessary to air that
observation in quite that way?

717
01:01:13,247 --> 01:01:17,001
The methods of Poirot, monsieur,
cannot always be agrèable.

718
01:01:44,767 --> 01:01:46,086
Mesdames.

719
01:01:46,127 --> 01:01:47,355
Excusez-moi, Dame Celia.

720
01:01:47,407 --> 01:01:51,036
Were you acquainted with Lady Boynton
before encountering her at the tomb?

721
01:01:51,087 --> 01:01:53,317
Well, I'd seen her about.

722
01:01:54,887 --> 01:01:56,878
Where had you seen her, madame?

723
01:01:57,647 --> 01:02:00,684
Lady Boynton was pointed out to me
by a man at a party

724
01:02:00,727 --> 01:02:03,400
who then preceded to tell me
rather a lot about her.

725
01:02:03,447 --> 01:02:05,597
About the way, in particular,
she treated her children.

726
01:02:05,647 --> 01:02:09,845
I decided then that I had no wish
to further acquaintance with the woman.

727
01:02:09,887 --> 01:02:11,718
She sounded perfectly odious.

728
01:02:11,767 --> 01:02:15,601
Who was this man
that was so well-informed?

729
01:02:15,647 --> 01:02:18,366
I didn't get his name.

730
01:02:19,287 --> 01:02:22,996
I wanted her dead, too.
Just in case you were wondering.

731
01:02:23,847 --> 01:02:25,565
She was clearly blocking my way.

732
01:02:25,607 --> 01:02:27,802
Raymond couldn't even look me in the eye
with her still in existence.

733
01:02:27,847 --> 01:02:31,123
So do you commend yourself to me
as a suspect, mademoiselle?

734
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:35,046
I commend myself to you as one who
has recently invested a great deal of time

735
01:02:35,087 --> 01:02:38,477
in a relationship
that was always heading nowhere.

736
01:02:38,527 --> 01:02:41,917
I now know that when I find something
I want, I must act to take it.

737
01:02:42,807 --> 01:02:44,365
(Celia) Bravo!

738
01:02:44,407 --> 01:02:47,558
Sadly, all this resolution has taken
your mind off the game.

739
01:02:47,607 --> 01:02:52,158
Little trick I learnt the other day
in Vienna.

740
01:02:52,207 --> 01:02:56,883
You see? Just when you least expect it,
the church comes storming back.

741
01:02:58,087 --> 01:02:59,406
Checkmate.

742
01:03:19,367 --> 01:03:21,403
I didn't know you smoked.

743
01:03:26,687 --> 01:03:28,325
I don't.

744
01:03:29,607 --> 01:03:31,006
I've given up.

745
01:03:31,047 --> 01:03:33,481
Since you threw the cigarette away,
you've given up?

746
01:03:33,527 --> 01:03:36,678
Your determination
is impressive. All six seconds of it.

747
01:03:36,727 --> 01:03:38,365
Keep talking, I could go ten.

748
01:03:38,407 --> 01:03:41,877
If I hadn't spoken,
would you just have kept watching me?

749
01:03:43,567 --> 01:03:45,523
We'll never know.

750
01:03:46,367 --> 01:03:48,085
You're a strange man.

751
01:03:48,127 --> 01:03:50,243
Does that matter?

752
01:03:50,287 --> 01:03:52,039
Not necessarily.

753
01:03:53,807 --> 01:03:56,480
- Raymond.
- Yeah.

754
01:03:56,527 --> 01:03:58,483
Now is the time to kiss me.

755
01:03:59,567 --> 01:04:01,000
Yeah.

756
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:17,202
(Speaks Arabic) Anybody in here
who isn't dead?

757
01:04:28,767 --> 01:04:30,678
(Agnieszka praying)

758
01:05:02,407 --> 01:05:05,365
(Continues praying)

759
01:05:14,567 --> 01:05:17,525
(Footsteps)

760
01:05:23,087 --> 01:05:24,076
(Stops abruptly)

761
01:05:34,007 --> 01:05:37,124
(Agnieszka resumes)

762
01:06:02,287 --> 01:06:04,403
(Men shouting)

763
01:06:04,447 --> 01:06:08,918
They have him, by God!
They have found the head of John!

764
01:06:08,967 --> 01:06:10,878
News that is astonishing, monsieur.

765
01:06:10,927 --> 01:06:14,761
I must return to Ain Musa
immediately.

766
01:06:14,807 --> 01:06:16,286
Is there a problem?

767
01:06:16,327 --> 01:06:19,000
Nanny Taylor
has drowned herself in the bath.

768
01:06:19,047 --> 01:06:24,201
- Suicide.
- Oh, my God. That's awful news.

769
01:06:24,247 --> 01:06:26,203
Is somebody... dealing with it?

770
01:06:26,247 --> 01:06:27,521
Oui, monsieur.

771
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:29,637
Because I must...

772
01:06:29,687 --> 01:06:34,317
I must get back to the dig, I can't...
you know.

773
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:35,402
Oui.

774
01:06:37,207 --> 01:06:41,166
Moral of the story: If you want your death
to attract the concern of your employer,

775
01:06:41,207 --> 01:06:43,437
make sure you're 2,000 years old.

776
01:06:43,487 --> 01:06:47,116
Oh! I keep meaning
to give you something.

777
01:06:48,127 --> 01:06:50,880
It's the details of the immigration
you needed.

778
01:06:50,927 --> 01:06:53,122
And on the back
there's a list of employees.

779
01:06:53,167 --> 01:06:54,486
Merci.

780
01:06:54,527 --> 01:06:57,678
As requested,
I've had a word with Mahmoud.

781
01:06:57,727 --> 01:06:59,604
Some of his boys are privately saying

782
01:06:59,647 --> 01:07:03,162
that there was some character lurking about
on the ladder that afternoon.

783
01:07:03,207 --> 01:07:05,357
An Arab. Not one of them.

784
01:07:05,407 --> 01:07:09,320
But that was a good hour or so
before the time of death.

785
01:07:09,367 --> 01:07:12,006
This case is a mess, Poirot.

786
01:07:12,727 --> 01:07:15,241
Not so, mon ami. This case...

787
01:07:16,287 --> 01:07:21,236
When Poirot has almost given up scrabbling
for purchase on its shell of armour...

788
01:07:22,047 --> 01:07:26,120
boff... it opens to him like a flower.

789
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:27,759
Good Lord.

790
01:07:28,647 --> 01:07:31,036
So... What do we do?

791
01:07:32,367 --> 01:07:36,076
We do what the murderer least expects
Poirot to do.

792
01:07:36,607 --> 01:07:38,120
We return to the dig.

793
01:07:39,847 --> 01:07:40,836
All of us.

794
01:07:47,287 --> 01:07:48,959
(Chattering)

795
01:07:52,607 --> 01:07:54,120
(Carbury) Ahem!

796
01:08:10,407 --> 01:08:15,606
This case, mes amis,
it is full of the red...

797
01:08:15,647 --> 01:08:16,966
fish.

798
01:08:17,727 --> 01:08:19,126
(Gerard) Herrings, possibly?

799
01:08:19,167 --> 01:08:24,446
Merci. There's so many diversions,
so many distractions.

800
01:08:25,927 --> 01:08:29,886
Attend well to Poirot as he peels
them away like the skin of an onion.

801
01:08:29,927 --> 01:08:34,955
Herrings, onions, do get a wriggle on,
there's a good fellow.

802
01:08:35,007 --> 01:08:40,001
Your wife, she funded your
expeditions as you went along.

803
01:08:40,047 --> 01:08:43,801
How much more efficient it would be
to have the money all at once, non?

804
01:08:43,847 --> 01:08:45,280
- What?
- There is no money.

805
01:08:45,327 --> 01:08:48,478
Non, vraiment monsieur,
for you there never has been.

806
01:08:48,527 --> 01:08:54,875
For the running of Boynton Hall,
alors, is for you always most arduous.

807
01:08:54,927 --> 01:08:57,885
Lady Boynton, she was always
most munificent to your father

808
01:08:57,927 --> 01:09:00,725
but never towards his son.

809
01:09:00,767 --> 01:09:04,476
You can stare at me significantly
as long as you like, monsieur.

810
01:09:04,527 --> 01:09:06,199
I've done nothing wrong.

811
01:09:06,247 --> 01:09:09,683
Tell to Poirot what was in the bag.

812
01:09:09,727 --> 01:09:10,842
What bag?

813
01:09:10,887 --> 01:09:14,402
<i>What did you agree to purchase
from the ragged Arab boy?</i>

814
01:09:15,367 --> 01:09:19,246
I remember the boy, I don't
remember what rubbish he was flogging.

815
01:09:19,287 --> 01:09:25,806
Fortunately, Poirot, he does.
And from it he extracted...

816
01:09:25,847 --> 01:09:27,519
this.

817
01:09:38,767 --> 01:09:41,361
- Voilà.
- Voilà what?

818
01:09:45,407 --> 01:09:46,442
Well, it's a tooth.

819
01:09:46,487 --> 01:09:48,796
(Poirot) D'être precis,

820
01:09:48,847 --> 01:09:52,556
it is a molar taken
from the upper jaw of St John.

821
01:09:52,607 --> 01:09:57,237
You will observe that it bears the traces
of the filling of gold.

822
01:09:57,287 --> 01:10:00,757
For this skull it was
supposed to masquerade

823
01:10:00,807 --> 01:10:03,640
as the skull of John the Baptist.

824
01:10:03,687 --> 01:10:07,236
But in fact it is as you say,
Monsieur Leonard, rubbish.

825
01:10:07,287 --> 01:10:10,245
What the devil are you
talking about, man?

826
01:10:10,287 --> 01:10:14,724
This wasn't purchased
from a hawker and planted.

827
01:10:14,767 --> 01:10:16,041
This is untouched.

828
01:10:16,087 --> 01:10:23,767
This entire sample was exhumed
e situ intacto.

829
01:10:23,807 --> 01:10:27,595
Forgive me, Poirot,
but you're drivelling utter bilge,

830
01:10:27,647 --> 01:10:28,921
pompous little Belgian.

831
01:10:28,967 --> 01:10:31,686
As my father has explained,
this object was discovered undisturbed.

832
01:10:35,167 --> 01:10:37,158
It's a perfect fit.

833
01:10:42,727 --> 01:10:43,921
I don't understand.

834
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:47,880
All your life, Father,

835
01:10:50,207 --> 01:10:52,437
traipsing about the Middle East...

836
01:10:52,487 --> 01:10:57,003
time after time finding absolutely
nothing of significance.

837
01:10:57,047 --> 01:10:59,436
I wanted it to end.

838
01:10:59,487 --> 01:11:04,003
You dear, deluded, stupid man.

839
01:11:04,047 --> 01:11:07,278
I never expected your wife's bloody money.
I never wanted it.

840
01:11:07,327 --> 01:11:11,002
I wanted you to be free of this need.

841
01:11:11,047 --> 01:11:13,402
To find what you've been looking for.

842
01:11:20,167 --> 01:11:21,759
Do you mind if I step out for a while?

843
01:11:21,807 --> 01:11:24,116
- I'll come with you.
- No, no.

844
01:11:24,167 --> 01:11:26,920
I simply wish to be alone
for a moment.

845
01:11:27,727 --> 01:11:30,161
Is that permitted?

846
01:11:30,207 --> 01:11:31,560
Je vous en prie, monsieur.

847
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:47,600
Now the three of you.

848
01:11:47,647 --> 01:11:50,798
The litany of cruelties
you have endured.

849
01:11:52,327 --> 01:11:54,158
The ceaseless humiliations.

850
01:11:54,207 --> 01:11:57,517
(Beating, child screaming)

851
01:11:58,327 --> 01:12:01,797
You multiply these incidents
by hundreds and thousands.

852
01:12:01,847 --> 01:12:05,522
The corrosion of the spirit,
it is inevitable and insupportable.

853
01:12:05,567 --> 01:12:08,718
(Child sobbing)

854
01:12:10,487 --> 01:12:13,126
No wonder you wished to see
Lady Boynton dead.

855
01:12:13,927 --> 01:12:16,839
Indeed Poirot, he overheard you,
Mademoiselle Carol,

856
01:12:16,887 --> 01:12:21,244
and you, Monsieur Raymond,
whispering that your mother... must die.

857
01:12:23,447 --> 01:12:25,756
And you, Dr King...

858
01:12:26,567 --> 01:12:29,559
By your own admission,
you also wished to see her dead.

859
01:12:29,607 --> 01:12:34,806
You are a woman who has wasted time
and is determined to waste no more.

860
01:12:37,167 --> 01:12:39,920
What do we know of you,
Monsieur Cope?

861
01:12:40,767 --> 01:12:42,086
Me?

862
01:12:43,407 --> 01:12:45,796
Will you show to me your passport?

863
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:52,436
Merci.

864
01:12:55,687 --> 01:12:58,360
You choose to use your second
Christian name and not your first?

865
01:12:58,407 --> 01:13:01,717
- Yes.
- Why is that, I wonder?

866
01:13:02,447 --> 01:13:06,599
My first given name is ambiguous,
in terms of gender.

867
01:13:06,647 --> 01:13:10,765
The spelling is different
but it's also a girl's name.

868
01:13:12,047 --> 01:13:14,766
As a child I found that tiresome.

869
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:17,526
I suggest that there are many things
about your childhood that you found...

870
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:19,558
"tiresome",

871
01:13:19,607 --> 01:13:21,325
Monsieur Leslie...

872
01:13:23,567 --> 01:13:25,319
Jefferson Cope.

873
01:13:26,767 --> 01:13:30,476
(Child crying and screaming)

874
01:13:33,047 --> 01:13:35,322
I don't think we're sufficiently sorry.

875
01:13:35,367 --> 01:13:37,278
The child that was thrashed...

876
01:13:38,207 --> 01:13:41,119
so brutally,
on the orders of Lady Boynton,

877
01:13:41,167 --> 01:13:45,877
was not a girl, as misremembered
by her daughter Carol, non...

878
01:13:47,407 --> 01:13:49,967
but a boy...

879
01:13:50,007 --> 01:13:51,963
by the name of Leslie.

880
01:13:52,007 --> 01:13:53,918
If you know all that,

881
01:13:55,167 --> 01:13:56,964
you'll also know that I didn't kill her.

882
01:13:57,007 --> 01:14:01,444
Merely to deprive her of her life would
afford for you satisfaction most scant.

883
01:14:01,487 --> 01:14:03,876
No, you wanted
to make her life unbearable.

884
01:14:03,927 --> 01:14:07,317
To degrade her,
to hurt the woman,

885
01:14:07,367 --> 01:14:10,723
as she hurt you.

886
01:14:13,007 --> 01:14:16,204
Lady Boynton was a person
preoccupied with station and money

887
01:14:16,247 --> 01:14:18,044
and you decided to strip her
of them both.

888
01:14:18,087 --> 01:14:21,443
So I may remain assured
of your very best services?

889
01:14:21,487 --> 01:14:23,955
<i>(Poirot) Of what service in particular
did you wish to remain assured?</i>

890
01:14:24,007 --> 01:14:27,397
You have no newspapers
of any description?!

891
01:14:27,447 --> 01:14:28,436
I am so sorry.

892
01:14:28,487 --> 01:14:32,400
(Poirot) The withholding from Lady Boynton
of the newspapers...

893
01:14:32,447 --> 01:14:34,119
that would keep her ignorant
of the panic

894
01:14:34,167 --> 01:14:37,842
that you yourself had inspired to ensure
the destruction of her empire.

895
01:14:38,487 --> 01:14:41,206
I'm just lousy at being intrepid.

896
01:14:41,247 --> 01:14:45,206
Back at the hotel you couldn't
get a paper for love nor money.

897
01:14:45,247 --> 01:14:48,398
And like the confidence trickster
so accomplished,

898
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:50,517
you invested in your own deceit.

899
01:14:50,567 --> 01:14:53,559
You wrote off thousands of dollars
of your own savings,

900
01:14:53,607 --> 01:14:55,563
merely to blow smoke
in the face of Poirot!

901
01:14:55,607 --> 01:14:56,960
Oh, Monsieur Cope.

902
01:14:57,007 --> 01:14:59,316
It seems I've lost quite a lot of money.

903
01:15:07,567 --> 01:15:12,880
Alors, Poirot has one more red herring
left to fry.

904
01:15:13,287 --> 01:15:15,926
And it is a fish most substantial.

905
01:15:16,967 --> 01:15:18,286
Le Colonel, mes amis,

906
01:15:18,327 --> 01:15:21,717
he is not a policeman
but is retained by the Foreign Office.

907
01:15:21,767 --> 01:15:26,283
His mission in Syria was to uncover and
destroy the trafficking of female slaves.

908
01:15:26,327 --> 01:15:31,037
The abduction and sale of women
for one purpose only.

909
01:15:31,087 --> 01:15:33,476
- Pardonnez-moi, mesdames.
- I knew it!

910
01:15:33,527 --> 01:15:34,755
Arab women.

911
01:15:34,807 --> 01:15:36,798
Whatever the client ordered.

912
01:15:36,847 --> 01:15:38,678
- White women?
- Yes.

913
01:15:38,727 --> 01:15:40,479
They wanted... me?

914
01:15:42,247 --> 01:15:43,680
Helas, mademoiselle.

915
01:15:44,847 --> 01:15:47,407
It is the opinion of Poirot...

916
01:15:48,847 --> 01:15:52,044
that there is a person
who instructed his agent

917
01:15:52,087 --> 01:15:55,045
to search for a young lady
who is Caucasian and resembled you.

918
01:15:55,087 --> 01:15:56,645
Exactement.

919
01:15:56,687 --> 01:16:01,807
With your skin that is pale
and your hair that is red.

920
01:16:01,847 --> 01:16:04,645
Who is this agent, Poirot?

921
01:16:05,407 --> 01:16:07,637
Is he here amongst us now?

922
01:16:07,687 --> 01:16:08,676
Certainement!

923
01:16:09,447 --> 01:16:12,280
Mademoiselle Jinny, when you struck at
your attacker that night,

924
01:16:12,327 --> 01:16:14,318
you hit your target.

925
01:16:15,287 --> 01:16:16,766
It's OK.

926
01:16:17,407 --> 01:16:20,046
The woman who befriended you
so assiduously...

927
01:16:20,087 --> 01:16:22,681
it was she who was
smothering your face!

928
01:16:22,727 --> 01:16:25,082
Sister Agnieszka!

929
01:16:31,327 --> 01:16:33,318
Rot in hell!

930
01:16:35,807 --> 01:16:38,275
You, Sister,
will face the consequences.

931
01:16:45,807 --> 01:16:49,083
The key... to the murder
of Lady Boynton...

932
01:16:49,807 --> 01:16:53,117
it is not who, it is when.

933
01:16:53,847 --> 01:16:56,236
Dame Celia, do you have any children?

934
01:16:56,287 --> 01:16:58,243
No, I do not.

935
01:16:58,287 --> 01:17:00,562
I urge you to reconsider
your answer, madame.

936
01:17:00,607 --> 01:17:03,997
I cannot reconsider. I have no children.

937
01:17:05,807 --> 01:17:09,720
Madame, you are a liar. You have
a daughter and she is amongst us now.

938
01:17:10,967 --> 01:17:14,721
That is a filthy lie.
And in extremely poor taste.

939
01:17:14,767 --> 01:17:17,440
So you disown her now,
as you did when she was a baby?

940
01:17:17,487 --> 01:17:19,762
Reclaim her of your own volition!

941
01:17:20,527 --> 01:17:23,246
You owe to her a debt of ungiven love!

942
01:17:25,607 --> 01:17:28,565
I had no choice. No choice.

943
01:17:30,927 --> 01:17:33,282
What was your position in the household
of Lady Boynton?

944
01:17:33,327 --> 01:17:35,602
In the days when she was
Mrs Pierce? Hm?

945
01:17:37,727 --> 01:17:40,195
- A junior maid.
- Oui, c'est ça.

946
01:17:40,247 --> 01:17:43,205
The servant of the lowest position
whose duty it is to scrub.

947
01:17:44,247 --> 01:17:48,206
Not to become pregnant
by a guest of your employer.

948
01:17:48,247 --> 01:17:52,320
The woman to whom you surrendered
your child on the day of its birth.

949
01:17:52,367 --> 01:17:53,356
Is it me?

950
01:17:54,247 --> 01:17:57,683
Non, mademoiselle Carol.
It is not you.

951
01:18:00,967 --> 01:18:02,844
Oh, my God.

952
01:18:04,567 --> 01:18:06,637
I'm so sorry.

953
01:18:22,367 --> 01:18:24,835
You gave birth to me?

954
01:18:25,647 --> 01:18:28,286
And delivered me up to that bitch?

955
01:18:28,327 --> 01:18:30,761
I came... to save you.

956
01:18:32,127 --> 01:18:33,924
How did you know this?

957
01:18:36,607 --> 01:18:40,839
Mademoiselle,
Poirot he did not know for certain.

958
01:18:40,887 --> 01:18:44,596
Until this... very moment.

959
01:18:48,447 --> 01:18:51,245
Non, non, non, mademoiselle.

960
01:18:51,287 --> 01:18:54,882
Mon Colonel, Poirot he is much obliged to
you for the accounts of the household

961
01:18:54,927 --> 01:18:56,724
and the registry of immigration

962
01:18:56,767 --> 01:19:00,157
which shows that three weeks
after the baby was born,

963
01:19:00,207 --> 01:19:03,563
Celia Westholme arrived
on the coast of Ireland,

964
01:19:03,607 --> 01:19:07,885
to be taken care of by nuns.

965
01:19:10,207 --> 01:19:12,437
Your child, she had been taken
from you,

966
01:19:12,487 --> 01:19:16,366
and so you were now to become invisible,
to nurse your shame.

967
01:19:16,407 --> 01:19:18,363
But you were not to be
the outcast. Oh, no.

968
01:19:18,407 --> 01:19:21,080
You were to recreate yourself
as a free spirit.

969
01:19:22,407 --> 01:19:24,967
A writer, a traveller. A success.

970
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:28,118
Dame Celia Westholme.

971
01:19:28,167 --> 01:19:31,523
And every time you thought
of your daughter,

972
01:19:31,567 --> 01:19:35,606
you consoled yourself with the hope
that she was happy

973
01:19:35,647 --> 01:19:38,764
but she had not begun life afresh,
she was not happy.

974
01:19:40,407 --> 01:19:45,606
She remained as a prisoner
in the household of Lady Boynton.

975
01:19:45,647 --> 01:19:47,603
(Water splashing)

976
01:19:47,647 --> 01:19:50,002
(Child choking)

977
01:19:50,047 --> 01:19:53,835
And your regret,
it came flooding back...

978
01:19:55,367 --> 01:19:57,562
to boil in your heart.

979
01:19:59,927 --> 01:20:02,805
Let me tell you a story.

980
01:20:02,847 --> 01:20:07,477
This... is the legend of Gilgamesh.

981
01:20:09,007 --> 01:20:13,478
Gilgamesh was
the most beautiful man in all creation.

982
01:20:24,287 --> 01:20:27,359
So you went in search of the father
of your child, to Vienna,

983
01:20:27,407 --> 01:20:29,398
so out of the way
of your customary travels,

984
01:20:29,447 --> 01:20:33,156
and together with this man,
you agreed...

985
01:20:33,207 --> 01:20:36,756
to investigate to see whether the cruelties
of Lady Boynton they were true.

986
01:20:36,807 --> 01:20:41,562
And you discovered that all of the children
had been tormented.

987
01:20:42,207 --> 01:20:45,005
It was not the hornet
that stung Lady Boynton.

988
01:20:45,447 --> 01:20:46,436
<i>How could it?</i>

989
01:20:46,487 --> 01:20:49,206
- Sorry, might have been stung.
- Ah!

990
01:20:49,247 --> 01:20:52,125
The hornet, it was already dead!

991
01:20:56,247 --> 01:20:58,158
You stung her...

992
01:20:58,207 --> 01:20:59,879
with this...

993
01:21:02,327 --> 01:21:03,442
(Lady Boynton) Ah!

994
01:21:03,487 --> 01:21:07,366
(Poirot)... which you then returned
to Dr Gerard, who had prepared it for you.

995
01:21:07,407 --> 01:21:09,363
(Lady Boynton) I am stung!

996
01:21:09,727 --> 01:21:13,640
He then cleaned it and discarded it
in the tent of Nanny Taylor,

997
01:21:13,687 --> 01:21:15,882
to implicate her.

998
01:21:15,927 --> 01:21:17,918
(Scoffs) This is... colossal!

999
01:21:17,967 --> 01:21:22,040
Wh-What was in the syringe?

1000
01:21:22,087 --> 01:21:26,000
A concoction of your own devising,
Doctor, probably based on morphia.

1001
01:21:26,047 --> 01:21:30,484
You can't kill a woman the size of
La Boynton with a thimbleful of morphia.

1002
01:21:30,527 --> 01:21:32,916
As you well know.

1003
01:21:32,967 --> 01:21:36,516
Doctor, you affect to know little
of the administering of drugs,

1004
01:21:36,567 --> 01:21:38,922
when en effet
you are the expert.

1005
01:21:38,967 --> 01:21:43,245
You greet Poirot and ask him
if he remembers you from Edinburgh.

1006
01:21:43,287 --> 01:21:47,200
The "bonce doctor," huh, with a beard?
Poirot, he remembers everything.

1007
01:21:47,247 --> 01:21:50,637
When you took the witness stand
in Edinburgh to speak on the mind,

1008
01:21:50,687 --> 01:21:53,804
the clerk of the court,
he read out your qualifications.

1009
01:21:53,847 --> 01:21:58,318
Anaesthesia, Doctor, was your discipline,
long before psychiatry.

1010
01:21:58,367 --> 01:22:01,564
No, of course you cannot kill Lady Boynton
with such a dose,

1011
01:22:01,607 --> 01:22:04,280
but you can remove from her
control of the nervous system.

1012
01:22:04,327 --> 01:22:07,717
The power over her movement.
The power over her speech.

1013
01:22:08,447 --> 01:22:13,680
And Lady Boynton, who professed herself
a lover of the sun...

1014
01:22:13,727 --> 01:22:18,881
was now roasting to death
and could say nothing.

1015
01:22:20,607 --> 01:22:24,395
Ingenious, monsieur,
and commendably grotesque.

1016
01:22:24,447 --> 01:22:29,316
But Lady Boynton did not "roast to death".
She was stabbed.

1017
01:22:29,367 --> 01:22:33,076
Your prestidigitation with drugs, Doctor,
was not over yet.

1018
01:22:33,127 --> 01:22:36,483
You injected yourself to simulate
the symptoms of malaria.

1019
01:22:36,527 --> 01:22:41,840
Symptoms so authentic
that you fooled even Dr King.

1020
01:22:41,887 --> 01:22:44,276
- I'll be fine!
- This gentleman needs to return to camp.

1021
01:22:44,327 --> 01:22:47,239
<i>Mademoiselle Jinny,
she attended you.</i>

1022
01:22:48,567 --> 01:22:51,240
<i>And how did you repay her
for her kindness?</i>

1023
01:22:51,287 --> 01:22:54,962
By giving to her another sedative
of your own invention,

1024
01:22:55,967 --> 01:22:58,527
to consolidate your alibi.

1025
01:22:58,567 --> 01:23:00,717
Earlier, you had killed a goat

1026
01:23:00,767 --> 01:23:04,521
and trapped a quantity of its blood
in a ball of wax.

1027
01:23:04,567 --> 01:23:08,276
<i>This object you secreted in the folds
of the clothes of your victim,</i>

1028
01:23:08,327 --> 01:23:10,966
<i>where in due course
it would melt in the heat of the sun.</i>

1029
01:23:11,007 --> 01:23:13,965
One can never have enough sun, huh?

1030
01:23:14,007 --> 01:23:16,362
- (She whimpers)
- What?

1031
01:23:16,407 --> 01:23:18,204
You could have killed her then,

1032
01:23:18,247 --> 01:23:21,523
but you wanted her to suffer
for as long as possible.

1033
01:23:22,007 --> 01:23:23,645
Speak up, dear.

1034
01:23:23,687 --> 01:23:26,281
I can't help you if you don't speak up.

1035
01:23:26,327 --> 01:23:30,036
You used the ball of wax
to confuse the time of death,

1036
01:23:30,087 --> 01:23:33,284
and it was this wax that Poirot,
he discovered on the dress of Lady Boynton,

1037
01:23:33,327 --> 01:23:38,117
and on the floorboards and the little
piece of pottery beneath her chair.

1038
01:23:39,767 --> 01:23:44,841
Wax which told to Poirot that there was
an accomplice to the murder.

1039
01:23:44,887 --> 01:23:47,640
Et puis, you waited patiently.

1040
01:23:49,127 --> 01:23:50,640
The wax, it melted,

1041
01:23:50,687 --> 01:23:53,645
the blood of the goat it began to flow,

1042
01:23:53,687 --> 01:23:56,918
suggesting to the naked eye
that she had already been stabbed.

1043
01:23:56,967 --> 01:24:00,755
And at last the cry it went up
to tell the world...

1044
01:24:00,807 --> 01:24:02,206
(Greville) Help!

1045
01:24:02,247 --> 01:24:05,159
...that Lady Boynton was dead,
but she was not dead.

1046
01:24:05,207 --> 01:24:07,118
Non, not yet.

1047
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:09,442
- Are you the girl who's a doctor?
- Yes.

1048
01:24:09,487 --> 01:24:12,399
Then you've met death. So have I.
Come on.

1049
01:24:12,447 --> 01:24:16,235
Only now...
was Death to meet its victim.

1050
01:24:16,287 --> 01:24:20,166
And in the sight of everyone,
in the sight of Hercule Poirot himself...

1051
01:24:21,807 --> 01:24:25,846
you, Dame Celia, murdered Lady Boynton
with your own hands,

1052
01:24:25,887 --> 01:24:30,005
as prescribed by Dr Gerard
to quench your rage.

1053
01:24:30,807 --> 01:24:33,401
It took but a few seconds.

1054
01:24:33,447 --> 01:24:39,682
Even Dr King was deceived into believing
that Lady Boynton had died earlier that day.

1055
01:24:39,727 --> 01:24:43,083
If you please to empty the contents
of your handbag.

1056
01:24:48,407 --> 01:24:51,399
(Poirot) Ha. Ah, oui.

1057
01:24:51,447 --> 01:24:54,962
And Dr Gerard, he encouraged
Poirot to seek for the chisel.

1058
01:24:55,007 --> 01:24:57,237
Chisel fits the bill.

1059
01:25:00,327 --> 01:25:03,285
Whereas the murder weapon
it was in your hand all of the day.

1060
01:25:04,127 --> 01:25:07,164
Goodness. We did go
to considerable trouble.

1061
01:25:09,367 --> 01:25:12,006
One question -

1062
01:25:12,047 --> 01:25:15,596
what makes you think any of this
has any basis whatsoever in the truth?

1063
01:25:18,367 --> 01:25:19,356
Nanny Taylor.

1064
01:25:19,407 --> 01:25:23,559
Dear God! Did I kill her as well
or was she one of yours?

1065
01:25:23,607 --> 01:25:26,724
You disordered her mind with
a solution of mescaline so strong

1066
01:25:26,767 --> 01:25:30,316
that the very speck of it made
the head of Poirot to spin.

1067
01:25:31,007 --> 01:25:35,922
You wanted to promote in her hallucinations
to make her susceptible to suggestion.

1068
01:25:35,967 --> 01:25:38,959
You burdened her mind with
so much shame and guilt

1069
01:25:39,007 --> 01:25:41,919
that given the opportunity you knew
that she would do harm to herself.

1070
01:25:41,967 --> 01:25:44,322
You know you can't go on...

1071
01:25:45,167 --> 01:25:47,044
after everything that you did.

1072
01:25:48,887 --> 01:25:51,640
Think what you helped her do
to little Jinny.

1073
01:25:52,807 --> 01:25:53,796
(Child choking)

1074
01:25:55,527 --> 01:25:57,324
What did Nanny Taylor say to you?

1075
01:25:58,367 --> 01:25:59,720
Fa... Fa... Father!

1076
01:25:59,767 --> 01:26:02,520
This was not the ravings
of a nervous breakdown.

1077
01:26:04,047 --> 01:26:06,242
For you yourself had told to her...

1078
01:26:06,287 --> 01:26:09,279
that you were the father
of Mademoiselle Jinny.

1079
01:26:19,447 --> 01:26:21,085
Portrait of Mum and Dad.

1080
01:26:23,047 --> 01:26:27,404
You'll appreciate now why I declined
your particular offer of affection.

1081
01:26:30,087 --> 01:26:34,558
(Sighs) Well, well. This is a pickle.

1082
01:26:36,847 --> 01:26:40,476
We set out to save you
and destroyed everything.

1083
01:26:43,287 --> 01:26:46,836
- Thank you, Theo.
- It's all part of the service.

1084
01:26:47,607 --> 01:26:49,404
No extra charge.

1085
01:26:55,967 --> 01:26:59,004
I never stopped loving you, you know.

1086
01:27:08,087 --> 01:27:10,362
Be careful with this one, Poirot.

1087
01:27:11,047 --> 01:27:12,958
Digitalis.

1088
01:27:13,007 --> 01:27:16,920
The action, as you will appreciate,
is irreversible.

1089
01:27:16,967 --> 01:27:19,686
I'm so sorry.

1090
01:27:20,327 --> 01:27:22,079
We hoped it wouldn't come to this.

1091
01:27:22,127 --> 01:27:23,276
(Gasps)

1092
01:27:26,007 --> 01:27:27,963
There, there, there.

1093
01:27:28,007 --> 01:27:30,475
There, there. There.

1094
01:27:33,527 --> 01:27:35,677
(Gasps) No. Don't, Doctor.

1095
01:27:39,127 --> 01:27:42,756
(Grunts) Look to the living.

1096
01:27:44,567 --> 01:27:48,355
They pay their bills quicker

1097
01:27:48,407 --> 01:27:53,686
and they make better... conversation.

1098
01:27:56,527 --> 01:27:57,880
(lnhales)

1099
01:28:06,287 --> 01:28:08,278
(Jinny sobbing)

1100
01:30:04,647 --> 01:30:08,959
Monsieur. I've just been chatting
to Lord Boynton.

1101
01:30:09,007 --> 01:30:13,558
He pronounces himself
"cured of archaeology".

1102
01:30:14,167 --> 01:30:16,123
- "Chatting."
- Oui.

1103
01:30:16,167 --> 01:30:19,876
Monsieur Raymond,
in the matter of Pandora,

1104
01:30:19,927 --> 01:30:24,000
you will recall that after all the evils
had escaped the box,

1105
01:30:24,047 --> 01:30:28,438
there was one other creature
very small, very frail,

1106
01:30:28,487 --> 01:30:31,559
that followed them into the world.

1107
01:30:31,607 --> 01:30:33,165
Hope.

1108
01:30:34,847 --> 01:30:36,883
Au revoir, la jeunesse.

1109
01:30:47,407 --> 01:30:49,523
- Monsieur Poirot.
- Mademoiselle.

1110
01:30:49,567 --> 01:30:52,639
Carol and I are going to Egypt,
to see the Sphinx.

1111
01:30:52,687 --> 01:30:55,724
It's not much of an adventure,
but we're doing it on our own.

1112
01:30:55,767 --> 01:30:58,440
It's a start. It was actually my idea.

1113
01:30:58,487 --> 01:31:02,321
Lady Boynton would've said
I was constitutionally too feeble,

1114
01:31:02,367 --> 01:31:05,165
that my skin was too fair

1115
01:31:05,207 --> 01:31:08,836
but I think it's probably time I showed
my feeble skin who's boss.

1116
01:31:08,887 --> 01:31:10,400
C'est bien, mademoiselle.

1117
01:31:11,447 --> 01:31:15,599
Before he leaves,
you will permit an old man to pontificate.

1118
01:31:15,647 --> 01:31:20,163
Alors, mademoiselle, there is
nothing in the world so damaged

1119
01:31:20,207 --> 01:31:23,404
that it cannot be repaired
by the hand of Almighty God.

1120
01:31:24,447 --> 01:31:27,962
I encourage you to know this
because without this certainty,

1121
01:31:28,007 --> 01:31:31,682
we should all of us... be mad.

1122
01:31:38,527 --> 01:31:41,883
Je vous salue, mademoiselle.

1123
01:31:43,327 --> 01:31:44,316
Au revoir.
