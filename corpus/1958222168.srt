1
00:03:55,036 --> 00:03:56,403
- What's up, baby boy?

2
00:03:56,971 --> 00:03:58,506
What's up, mama?

3
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:02,808
Whoa!
What are you doing?

4
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,344
- Washing my hands.
- His mama got locked up.

5
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:07,378
- What? For what?

6
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,515
- An old warrant
or some bullshit.

7
00:04:09,517 --> 00:04:11,517
I don't know, but you
need to go bail her.

8
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,786
- Why can't she just
thug it out?

9
00:04:13,788 --> 00:04:16,055
- Because I got work.
I can't watch him.

10
00:04:16,057 --> 00:04:17,690
- Well, who said you
have to watch him?

11
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:19,961
- Well, I know you ain't gonna
watch him, so...

12
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,762
- How much is it?
400.

13
00:04:22,764 --> 00:04:24,395
- Ah, shit.
What the fuck?

14
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:25,831
How the fuck am I
gonna get that?

15
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,967
- I don't fucking know where
you're gonna get $400.

16
00:04:27,969 --> 00:04:29,568
Ask her aunties.
- Mom, her aunties

17
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,970
don't even like me.

18
00:04:30,972 --> 00:04:32,505
I ain't got time for this.

19
00:04:32,507 --> 00:04:33,839
- You don't have time
for what shit?

20
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:35,777
Your baby mama? Or me?

21
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:01,869
- Oh, you got a collar, huh?

22
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:13,648
Yo.

23
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:16,751
I have your dog.

24
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,621
Yeah, where you live at?

25
00:05:23,825 --> 00:05:26,359
Like the first one
or the second one?

26
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:36,103
Alright. Well, I'll be by
in like a couple minutes
or something.

27
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:39,674
Alright.

28
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:47,847
Yo, you guys wanna buy a PS4?

29
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:49,380
No.

30
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:50,585
- Come on.

31
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:54,487
Come on.

32
00:05:57,692 --> 00:05:59,558
Here you go. Come on.

33
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,660
- What kind of dog is it?
- I don't even know.

34
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:03,130
She was just outside
of my house.

35
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:05,831
She's pretty cool, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

36
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,766
- You wanna buy her?
- No.

37
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:09,136
- Come on.

38
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:55,950
- Hey, you good?

39
00:06:56,784 --> 00:06:59,620
- Man, nah, I'm fucking
confused, bro.

40
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,198
- Fuck, bro, it's hot outside.

41
00:07:12,867 --> 00:07:14,902
- Hotter than Germ's
math teacher.

42
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:17,836
- Oh, score.

43
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:19,004
- Yeah.

44
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:20,940
He's flexing the burrito.

45
00:07:20,942 --> 00:07:22,777
- It's a bologna sandwich.

46
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:25,778
Hey, I'll give you 50 bucks
for this couch.

47
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,916
- I know he got some blaze.

48
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:32,851
- Hey, Donny,
don't look at these.

49
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:34,019
- Holy cow.

50
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:36,155
Holy fuck, these are
pretty nice, bro.

51
00:07:36,157 --> 00:07:39,091
- Hey, don't fuck with that.
My dad will fuck you up, man.

52
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:42,962
- Alright, after I look
I'll return it.

53
00:07:42,964 --> 00:07:44,596
- Geez!
- What?

54
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:46,131
- Holy shit!
What is this?

55
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,100
I knew he had something.

56
00:07:48,102 --> 00:07:49,535
What is this?
- Let me see.

57
00:07:49,537 --> 00:07:51,704
- Let me check it out.

58
00:07:51,706 --> 00:07:53,874
- Fuck you.
- Yo, we can smoke that.

59
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:57,076
Bro, let's smoke it then.

60
00:07:57,078 --> 00:07:59,013
- Fuck that.
- Why?

61
00:08:00,214 --> 00:08:02,081
- My dad will fuck me up.

62
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,049
- Bruh.

63
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:05,617
- Shit's bunk.

64
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:07,553
- Did you experience it?

65
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,925
- Bro... It's meth.

66
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:14,593
- Meth is the best.

67
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:16,964
- I'm about it,
walking around like that.

68
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,666
- Like you tried it.

69
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:22,036
- Like you ever tried it?

70
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:26,538
- Well, I did.
- Oh. My. Gosh.

71
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,640
But I did.

72
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:29,808
- Geez.

73
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,512
- And it tastes like shit.

74
00:08:32,046 --> 00:08:33,912
Bro, it burns the back
of your throat so much

75
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:35,216
it makes you skinny.

76
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:37,916
It makes you throw up
all your food.

77
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:40,185
You stay up for like, 14 days.

78
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,056
Bro, one single fucking hit.

79
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,025
- One hit, you're addicted.
- Fucker.

80
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:50,896
- Boy, you're like, 10.

81
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:52,865
You can't have
tried it back then.

82
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:54,666
- Chicken wing, no way.

83
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:56,237
- Let me see then.

84
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:59,640
You being a bitch, bro.
Just let me see.

85
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:07,982
- Bro, you're gonna end up
bony as fuck.

86
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,819
Let's sell it.

87
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:17,289
- Yo, who is it?

88
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,794
- I was talking to somebody
about returning a dog.

89
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:25,666
- Oh, yeah. She's mine.
Let me see.

90
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:28,035
Come on.

91
00:09:32,073 --> 00:09:34,006
So, what's good?

92
00:09:34,008 --> 00:09:35,374
- Not much.
You got a return fee?

93
00:09:35,376 --> 00:09:37,342
- For what?
- Well, we were just thinking,

94
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:38,777
since we brought it back,

95
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:40,179
you could hook it up
with a little something.

96
00:09:40,181 --> 00:09:41,780
- Can't be giving out
hand-outs, bro.

97
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:43,615
That's bad for business.

98
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:44,917
But if you want to buy her,

99
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:47,152
I could cut you in
because you found her.

100
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:48,987
She's expensive though.
- Fuck.

101
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:51,056
How much is she?
- A rack.

102
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:53,192
Sometimes two.
Just depends.

103
00:09:53,194 --> 00:09:54,960
- Fuck, a rack for that?
- Fuck yeah. Shit.

104
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:57,296
If you breed her,
the puppies go for like,
a rack or two each.

105
00:09:57,298 --> 00:09:59,098
- Holy fuck, man.

106
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,200
- Yo, so I'm gonna make
some tea. Do you guys want any?

107
00:10:01,202 --> 00:10:03,001
- No, I'm good.
- No, we're straight.

108
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:05,704
But I just think it's fucked up
that we did a good deed

109
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:08,674
when we didn't have to, and
we can't get no deal or nothing.

110
00:10:08,676 --> 00:10:10,209
We could've just
ran off with it.

111
00:10:10,211 --> 00:10:12,277
- Could cut you a deal for 990

112
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,946
for your little good
deed or whatever.

113
00:10:13,948 --> 00:10:16,048
- What the fuck? 990? Ain't that
some cheap-skating ass shit?

114
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,282
You're only taking
10 bucks off of that.

115
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:18,851
You fucking serious?
- I mean, you're the one

116
00:10:18,853 --> 00:10:20,219
fucking coming at me
with a deal.

117
00:10:20,221 --> 00:10:21,753
I'm giving you one, bro.

118
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:23,789
- First of all, we ain't come
and ask for a deal.

119
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,826
We're coming because
we're bringing your dog back.

120
00:10:26,561 --> 00:10:28,827
And second of all,
when do I need the money by?

121
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:30,329
Shit.

122
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:32,397
Could be tonight.
Could be tomorrow.

123
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,301
ASAP.

124
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:38,971
- Hurry up, you fucking...

125
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:40,405
- His donkey looks retarded.

126
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:42,808
- We got some meth, bro.
You want some?

127
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,143
- Shut the fuck up.

128
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:45,744
- That donkey's straight up
dementia or something.

129
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:46,912
Fuck.

130
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:48,747
- Yo, why are you calling
me out like that?

131
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:51,185
- 'Cuz, bro, we got some shit
and we need to get rid of it.

132
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:54,119
- How much?
- How much do you want?

133
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:56,056
- Probably just a dub right now.

134
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:58,957
- 100 bucks, bro.
- 100 bucks for

135
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,293
a fucking dub, man?
What the fuck, man?

136
00:11:01,295 --> 00:11:03,162
That shit's outrageous, bro.
- All right. 60 bucks.

137
00:11:03,164 --> 00:11:05,164
- 60 bucks is still
too much, man.

138
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,366
What the fuck? You think
I'm a bank or something?

139
00:11:07,368 --> 00:11:09,268
I'll give you $20
for two dubs, man.
That's a deal.

140
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,936
- Okay wait, hold up.
You got any hoots?

141
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:12,171
- Shit, yeah.
I got a couple.

142
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:13,405
- Well, I'll tell you this.

143
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:15,207
We'll take 40 and the hoots.

144
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:17,176
- Shit, all I got is
20 on me right now.

145
00:11:17,178 --> 00:11:19,745
- Alright, bro, that'll work.
Give it to him.

146
00:11:19,747 --> 00:11:21,348
- Shit, y'all are crazy.

147
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:26,820
Alright, for sure, boys.

148
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,096
- Pleasure doing business
with you and your donkey.

149
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:41,400
- Yeah, papered,
but we have to pay tomorrow.

150
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:44,136
- What's he getting
a poodle for?

151
00:11:44,138 --> 00:11:45,270
- Puppy soup.
- No shit?

152
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:47,206
- Alright, then.
Well, hit me back.

153
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,974
- Bro, what you getting
a poodle for?

154
00:11:48,976 --> 00:11:51,376
- Bro, because when I breed her,
that's like 10 G's per litter.

155
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,045
- Shit. How much?

156
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:55,013
- She's a rack, but I got
a good deal for her.

157
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:57,017
- I know, but how much
for the one you're getting?

158
00:11:57,785 --> 00:11:58,917
- I just said that.

159
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,452
- She's a rack,
but I got a good deal.

160
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:02,120
Damn, a rack for a poodle?

161
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:03,288
- Yeah.
- I've been saying, man.

162
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,823
Fuck, we should have just
stole that thing.

163
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:06,124
Shit.
- Yeah.

164
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:07,426
Bro, that's fucking crazy shit.

165
00:12:07,428 --> 00:12:09,194
- Shit, who are you gonna
breed it with?

166
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:10,295
- Hello?

167
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:11,964
- Who's he gonna
breed it with, bro?

168
00:12:11,966 --> 00:12:13,865
- I don't know, man,
but it don't make no sense.

169
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:16,235
- Yeah, if you want
to split the litter,
you gotta come in on half.

170
00:12:16,237 --> 00:12:18,770
- Who you talking to?
- I'm talking to Tiberius, man.

171
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:20,540
Chill out.
- Man, fuck that motherfucker.

172
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:22,241
- Is it one of those
little poodles?

173
00:12:22,243 --> 00:12:24,176
- No, it's a legit poodle, bro.

174
00:12:24,178 --> 00:12:26,912
- Yeah, bro. Uh...
If we get the brindled ones,

175
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:28,480
it's 4 K a dog.

176
00:12:28,482 --> 00:12:30,082
- Bro, tell him I said
fuck him, bro.

177
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:31,450
If I see him,
I'm gonna fuck him up

178
00:12:31,452 --> 00:12:32,951
and I'm gonna take his dog.

179
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:34,419
- Bro, you need
to calm down, alright?

180
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,822
This is business.
Plus, he don't have the dog.

181
00:12:36,824 --> 00:12:39,157
See, this is the point.
I'm trying to have him
buy the dog with me.

182
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,892
- I could care a less, bro.
Still, fuck him.

183
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:42,494
Tell him I said that shit too.
- Shit.

184
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:44,229
<i>- Hello?</i>
<i>Who are you talking about?</i>

185
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:46,498
- Huh? No, man. We ain't
fucking talking about you.

186
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,333
- We are fucking talking
about you.

187
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:49,801
- Man, shut up.

188
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:51,270
Hey, but I'll talk
to you later, alright?

189
00:12:51,272 --> 00:12:53,506
- Tiberius? What kind
of fucking name is that anyway?

190
00:12:53,508 --> 00:12:55,575
Did he call Popcorn?

191
00:12:55,577 --> 00:12:57,175
- Shit.

192
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:58,443
- Yeah, bro.
But remember Popcorn

193
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,114
is breeding with
Sissy Sanchez now.

194
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,092
- Pop this bitch...

195
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:46,058
- Hey, bro.
This ain't enough.

196
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,993
- I got you.
- Alright, thank you, Auntie.

197
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:49,227
- I got him.

198
00:13:56,337 --> 00:13:58,236
- Hey, are you guys hiring?
- We are not.

199
00:13:58,238 --> 00:13:59,373
- No?

200
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:05,479
Echo!

201
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,013
Echo!
- What?

202
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:10,117
- Is that my baby
or did you have another one?

203
00:14:11,485 --> 00:14:13,285
Echo!
- What do you want?

204
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:15,588
- You. Where you been at?

205
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,525
- Home.
- Oh.

206
00:14:19,594 --> 00:14:22,029
It's like that?
- What do you want?

207
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,031
- I got you this.

208
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:26,064
- I gotta go.
- Why?

209
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:27,899
- Because I don't want
to talk to you right now.

210
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:29,436
- Why?
- Because I'm mad at you.

211
00:14:30,404 --> 00:14:31,937
- Since when?

212
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:33,238
- Since you stole my fucking car

213
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,540
and missed your son's baptism.

214
00:14:34,542 --> 00:14:36,141
Took that hoe on a run
to Denver

215
00:14:36,143 --> 00:14:38,009
when I told you my car
didn't have tags.

216
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:39,581
- Shit.
- Yep.

217
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:42,414
- But like, you don't even
know me anymore.

218
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,149
I'm a changed man.

219
00:14:44,151 --> 00:14:46,519
I'm about to be rich as fuck
with a million poodles.

220
00:14:46,521 --> 00:14:48,623
- I gotta go.
- Ah.

221
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:58,330
- Fuck.

222
00:15:19,854 --> 00:15:21,721
- Man, Germ, you're stinking

223
00:15:21,723 --> 00:15:23,623
like some fucking ass
or something.

224
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:27,227
- You haven't showered
in four weeks.

225
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:29,428
- Chee four.

226
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:33,064
- If you laugh, you're in
love with Lil' Marty.

227
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:34,634
Alright, alright.

228
00:15:34,636 --> 00:15:37,137
- Nay, this guy laughed.
- Starting now.

229
00:15:46,681 --> 00:15:48,248
- Fucker's out.

230
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:55,122
- Hi.

231
00:15:57,491 --> 00:15:59,426
- Stealing from your
own dad now, huh?

232
00:16:03,665 --> 00:16:05,032
Hello?

233
00:16:06,668 --> 00:16:07,968
- No.

234
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:12,139
- Who the fuck ate
my sandwich then?

235
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:14,542
- I did.

236
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:17,411
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

237
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:28,222
- I need the bed tonight.
- Okay.

238
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:10,395
- Alright, I got wheels, rims,

239
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:13,365
catalytic converters,
batteries, gas.

240
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:15,501
Oh, and a GPS system.

241
00:17:15,503 --> 00:17:18,069
- I can do $250 for everything
but the gas.

242
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:20,205
I don't buy gas anymore.
- Fuck, would you be able

243
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:23,709
to do at least $400 or $350?
- No, it's the end of the month.

244
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,711
You'll have to wait
till next Thursday

245
00:17:25,713 --> 00:17:28,113
when the boss gets back if you
want him to take another look.

246
00:17:28,115 --> 00:17:29,849
- To be honest, I'm just
trying to buy this dog.

247
00:17:29,851 --> 00:17:31,584
- What's the best you
can do today?

248
00:17:31,586 --> 00:17:33,418
- It's $250, man.

249
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,522
- Fuck.

250
00:17:35,857 --> 00:17:38,089
- I'll take that rice cooker
for $20, though.

251
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:40,292
- $20? Alright then.

252
00:17:40,294 --> 00:17:41,727
But I gotta sell it with
the dishwashing gloves.

253
00:17:41,729 --> 00:17:43,796
It's like a two-for-one deal.

254
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:46,099
- Well, how about $22 for both?

255
00:17:46,834 --> 00:17:48,536
- Yeah. That sounds good.

256
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,505
- Bro, you know anybody
looking for any PS4's?

257
00:17:52,507 --> 00:17:54,372
- No, we don't buy PS4's, bro.

258
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:56,176
You might have to try
Prairie's Edge.

259
00:17:56,511 --> 00:17:57,843
- Fuck, alright.

260
00:18:06,621 --> 00:18:09,254
- 100 equals 10
to the second power.

261
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:10,856
10 times 10.

262
00:18:10,858 --> 00:18:13,526
1,000 equals 10
to the third power.

263
00:18:13,528 --> 00:18:18,664
10 times 10 times 10 times
10 times 10 times 10,

264
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,900
and so on through the series.

265
00:18:20,902 --> 00:18:23,636
Now, we can do it with
another number like 2

266
00:18:23,638 --> 00:18:25,671
which is pretty straightforward.

267
00:18:25,673 --> 00:18:28,741
Two to the first power
equals itself. Two.

268
00:18:28,743 --> 00:18:31,209
Two to the second power
equals four.

269
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:34,245
Now... following that pattern,

270
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:36,649
what would be the next number
in this series?

271
00:18:36,651 --> 00:18:39,785
- Two to the fifth power?
- Good.

272
00:18:39,787 --> 00:18:42,187
- Two to the fifth power.

273
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:44,458
And the answer to that
would be what?

274
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:47,927
- 20?

275
00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:50,161
- It would be two times two

276
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:53,899
times two times
two times two is eight.

277
00:18:53,901 --> 00:18:55,534
Two times eight is 16.

278
00:18:55,536 --> 00:18:57,937
Two times 16 is 32.

279
00:18:57,939 --> 00:19:01,339
So, this is all the material
that you're gonna need to know

280
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:03,375
for your quiz on Thursday.

281
00:19:03,377 --> 00:19:05,811
Those of you that don't have
your notebooks and pencils out,

282
00:19:05,813 --> 00:19:08,648
you probably want to get them
out and get these down.

283
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:12,285
Any questions on this so far?
Does this make sense?

284
00:19:13,087 --> 00:19:15,588
Thursday's quiz is going
to cover exponents.

285
00:19:16,891 --> 00:19:18,860
So, see you tomorrow.

286
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:39,545
<i>- This is a prepaid</i>
<i>call from...</i>

287
00:19:39,547 --> 00:19:40,980

288
00:19:40,982 --> 00:19:44,249

<i>- What are you doing?</i>
<i>Come bail me.</i>

294
00:19:52,994 --> 00:19:55,460
- What the fuck
you talking about? How?
I don't even have no money.

295
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:57,598
<i>- I don't know, Bill.</i>
<i>Figure it out.</i>

296
00:19:57,999 --> 00:19:59,965
<i>It's fucking cold in here.</i>
- Well, then what the fuck

297
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:01,767
did you do to get there
in the first place?

298
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:03,903
<i>- For a traffic violation, Bill.</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

299
00:20:03,905 --> 00:20:05,971
<i>Is my son okay?</i>

300
00:20:05,973 --> 00:20:08,974
- Duh, what you think?
<i>- Well, where is he?</i>

301
00:20:08,976 --> 00:20:11,409
- With my mom.
<i>- You have 30 seconds left.</i>

302
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:14,647
<i>- Well, man the fuck up</i>
<i>and bail me right now, Bill.</i>
<i>I'm not fucking playing.</i>

303
00:20:14,649 --> 00:20:16,882
- How about you fucking call
the homeboy that you've been

304
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:19,250
messaging and have him
come bail you?

305
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:21,554
<i>- Oh, you mean homeboy</i>
<i>who looks after your son</i>

306
00:20:21,556 --> 00:20:22,922
<i>because you're too busy</i>
<i>rattling off</i>

307
00:20:22,924 --> 00:20:24,757
<i>with your new family to be</i>
<i>a fucking dad to him?</i>

308
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:26,291
<i>You rat off all</i>
<i>the fucking time.</i>

309
00:20:26,293 --> 00:20:27,593
- You know what?
Girl, I rat around

310
00:20:27,595 --> 00:20:29,327
because I don't even know
where we stand, alright?

311
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:30,963
And I ain't got time for this.
<i>- ...bail me out</i>

312
00:20:30,965 --> 00:20:32,667
<i>so I can take care</i>
<i>of my own goddamn--</i>

313
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,406
- Hello?

314
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:42,975
<i>- Hey, man.</i>
<i>What you selling?</i>

315
00:20:42,977 --> 00:20:45,711
- What up, bro?
It's a poodle with papers.

316
00:20:45,713 --> 00:20:47,479
<i>- Why the fuck you buying</i>
<i>a poodle, man?</i>

317
00:20:47,481 --> 00:20:49,682
- Nah, I'm gonna breed her, but
I gotta pay this girl tomorrow.

318
00:20:49,684 --> 00:20:51,550
<i>- Well, how much then?</i>
- Hey, I'm gonna have

319
00:20:51,552 --> 00:20:53,386
to call you back. Alright?
<i>- No problem.</i>

320
00:21:11,873 --> 00:21:13,839
- What's up, man?
- Howdy.

321
00:21:13,841 --> 00:21:14,907
- You need some help?

322
00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:16,809
- Yeah, my front tire's
blown out.

323
00:21:16,811 --> 00:21:19,545
- Damn. Well,
you got any cash on you?

324
00:21:19,547 --> 00:21:21,714
I could help you like,
take you to Rush or something.

325
00:21:21,716 --> 00:21:23,849
- I was hoping maybe
you'd take me up to my house

326
00:21:23,851 --> 00:21:25,885
and I'll have my boys
come back for the truck.

327
00:21:25,887 --> 00:21:28,053
- Well, where do you live?
- About two miles out

328
00:21:28,055 --> 00:21:29,724
of Scottsbluff.

329
00:21:30,057 --> 00:21:31,491
- Ooh.

330
00:21:32,093 --> 00:21:33,426
Hmm.

331
00:21:34,662 --> 00:21:37,596
That's gonna have to cost you.
- Yeah?

332
00:21:37,598 --> 00:21:39,934
How much?
- Shit.

333
00:21:40,835 --> 00:21:43,434
Scottsbluff is pretty far.

334
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:46,874
Plus, I need some gas.
I'd say at least like, $80.

335
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:48,908
- All right.
That'll work.

336
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,676
- Alright. Well, hop in.
- Alrighty.

337
00:22:06,127 --> 00:22:09,094
- What's up, Dad?
- What's up, little man?

338
00:22:09,096 --> 00:22:11,564
- Nothing.
- How was school?

339
00:22:11,566 --> 00:22:12,600
- Good.

340
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,669
- Tight. Tight.

341
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:17,402
- Well, you wanna play
some video games?

342
00:22:17,404 --> 00:22:19,038
- Nah, I gotta work.

343
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,840
- Why, you still got
that one job?

344
00:22:20,842 --> 00:22:22,877
- No, those fuckers fired me
over some dumb shit.

345
00:22:24,979 --> 00:22:27,646
- I'm going to get a job soon.
- Oh, yeah?

346
00:22:27,648 --> 00:22:30,918
- Yeah. So I can get a phone
and talk to my girl.

347
00:22:33,087 --> 00:22:34,789
- You ain't got no girl.

348
00:22:39,093 --> 00:22:40,595
You wanna hit it?

349
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:43,664
I know you smoke.

350
00:22:58,779 --> 00:23:00,713
Alright, Snoop.

351
00:23:00,715 --> 00:23:02,583
Give me that back now.

352
00:23:07,154 --> 00:23:08,623
That's what you get.

353
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,959
- I got a hot lunch for you.

354
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:16,163
- You ate already?
- Yeah, I ate.

355
00:23:17,565 --> 00:23:18,766
- What'd you eat?

356
00:23:19,734 --> 00:23:21,734
- Oh, shit. My bad.

357
00:23:21,736 --> 00:23:24,805
That was last night,
but I'm not even hungry.

358
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,108
- Alright.

359
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:33,145
What's that?
- A book to learn magic.

360
00:23:33,147 --> 00:23:35,080
- Show me a magic trick.

361
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:36,949
- What kind of magic?

362
00:23:36,951 --> 00:23:39,919
- I don't know.
Show me a card trick, something.

363
00:23:39,921 --> 00:23:41,452
- I don't like card tricks.

364
00:23:41,454 --> 00:23:42,556
- Why not?

365
00:23:43,157 --> 00:23:45,925
- 'Cause it's not real magic.
- What's real magic?

366
00:23:45,927 --> 00:23:48,663
- Like when you can change
things with your mind.

367
00:23:49,664 --> 00:23:51,063
- I'll show you a magic trick.

368
00:23:51,065 --> 00:23:52,765
I'll make this food disappear.

369
00:23:52,767 --> 00:23:55,534
Alright, man. I'm out.

370
00:23:55,536 --> 00:23:57,236
- Alright. I'll be in in a bit.

371
00:23:57,238 --> 00:23:58,606
- Alright.

372
00:24:23,898 --> 00:24:25,833
- You can just pull over here.

373
00:24:39,547 --> 00:24:41,048
Wait here for a second.

374
00:24:54,128 --> 00:24:55,763
Say, Bill.

375
00:24:56,263 --> 00:24:58,263
How'd you like
to make another $100?

376
00:24:58,265 --> 00:24:59,898
- Shit, how so?

377
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,568
- The thing is I'm supposed
to have dinner with my wife

378
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:04,603
and I was hoping that
you'd do me a favor

379
00:25:04,605 --> 00:25:07,908
and head out to the truck
and swap out that tire for me.

380
00:25:08,876 --> 00:25:10,277
- Hmm.

381
00:25:12,947 --> 00:25:14,915
Is it all yours?

382
00:25:15,516 --> 00:25:17,918
- Yep. It's all mine.
- Hmm.

383
00:25:19,153 --> 00:25:22,156
I could do it for $200.
- Okay.

384
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:25,926
Here's the thing, Bill.

385
00:25:27,094 --> 00:25:29,762
The important thing
here is that...

386
00:25:29,764 --> 00:25:31,797
I got a girl out in that truck.

387
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,699
- Ooh.

388
00:25:33,701 --> 00:25:36,769
And I'm going to need you
to give her a ride home.

389
00:25:36,771 --> 00:25:38,072
Could you do that for me?

390
00:25:38,606 --> 00:25:40,572
- Sure. Where does she stay?

391
00:25:40,574 --> 00:25:42,174
- I don't know.
You'll have to ask her.

392
00:25:42,176 --> 00:25:43,742
Somewhere on the rez, I think.

393
00:25:43,744 --> 00:25:45,579
- Oh, shit.

394
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,782
Shit, I mean that's like
a couple hours to go pick her up

395
00:25:49,784 --> 00:25:52,051
and an hour back to Ridge,

396
00:25:52,053 --> 00:25:54,319
plus I don't even know
where she'll be staying.

397
00:25:54,321 --> 00:25:56,755
I'm gonna need a little
bit more than $200.

398
00:25:56,757 --> 00:25:58,257
- How much more?
- $400.

399
00:25:58,259 --> 00:25:59,958
- $400?
- And a job.

400
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,228
- And a job?

401
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,963
What makes you think
I got a job for you?

402
00:26:04,965 --> 00:26:06,665
- I mean...

403
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:10,604
You got two big houses,
big 'ol land.

404
00:26:12,306 --> 00:26:13,806
You must be doing
something right.

405
00:26:13,808 --> 00:26:15,042
- Uh-huh.

406
00:26:15,743 --> 00:26:19,311
I'll tell you what.
I'm not gonna give you $400,

407
00:26:19,313 --> 00:26:22,147
but we can see about the job.

408
00:26:22,149 --> 00:26:23,615
What do you think?

409
00:26:23,617 --> 00:26:26,285
- Yeah, well,
I appreciate all that,

410
00:26:26,287 --> 00:26:28,887
but I gotta go get my son
to the dentist.

411
00:26:28,889 --> 00:26:30,189
I'm gonna have to pass.

412
00:26:30,191 --> 00:26:31,824
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

413
00:26:31,826 --> 00:26:33,327
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

414
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:37,696
I'll do $300...

415
00:26:37,698 --> 00:26:40,935
and you might be in luck
with the job, yeah.

416
00:26:41,902 --> 00:26:44,203
- Yeah. Yeah.
I could do that.

417
00:26:44,205 --> 00:26:45,873
Throw it in the trunk.
- Alrighty.

418
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,815
- Check this out.

419
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,116
- That's pretty cool.

420
00:26:57,118 --> 00:26:58,784
- I waited six fucking months

421
00:26:58,786 --> 00:27:00,054
for this little bastard, man.

422
00:27:02,389 --> 00:27:04,723
They sent it
to two or three P.O. boxes

423
00:27:04,725 --> 00:27:06,193
before they finally got us.

424
00:27:07,761 --> 00:27:09,196
I spaced them out.

425
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,700
Yeah.

426
00:27:14,068 --> 00:27:15,903
Alright, little man.
See you later.

427
00:27:16,303 --> 00:27:18,770
Alright. See you, Dad.

428
00:27:18,772 --> 00:27:20,272
- Yeah.

429
00:27:44,698 --> 00:27:46,167
- Fuck!
- What are you doing, bro?

430
00:27:46,934 --> 00:27:49,768
- Don't come barging in
like that next time.

431
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:51,203
- My bad.
- Fuck this guy.

432
00:27:51,205 --> 00:27:54,206
- Scared you shitless?

433
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:55,709
Or shirtless?

434
00:27:56,877 --> 00:27:58,810
- Here you go, bro.
Check it out.

435
00:27:58,812 --> 00:28:02,347
This here, my boy,
is Epsom salt.

436
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:05,052
- Ha, I ain't your fuckin' son.

437
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,767
- You good?
- Yeah.

438
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:23,771
- I'm Bill.
I'm taking you home.

439
00:28:35,916 --> 00:28:37,718
Go ahead.
You can just get in.

440
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,192
- Look at these little guys.

441
00:28:47,194 --> 00:28:48,994
- Fucking mutts,
forget about it.

442
00:28:48,996 --> 00:28:49,897
- Who's looking?

443
00:28:50,331 --> 00:28:52,130
- Who's all looking?

444
00:28:52,132 --> 00:28:53,899
- Is this shit good, or what?

445
00:28:53,901 --> 00:28:56,070
- It's good stuff, bro.
- Yeah, it's legit.

446
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,403
- Who's your dad?

447
00:28:58,405 --> 00:29:00,105
- Arnie Whitehorse.

448
00:29:00,107 --> 00:29:02,374
- Get the fuck outta here.
- Whitehorse's kid out here

449
00:29:02,376 --> 00:29:04,276
trying to sell me
his own fucking drugs.

450
00:29:04,278 --> 00:29:05,811
How much?

451
00:29:05,813 --> 00:29:06,979
- 50 bucks.
- 35.

452
00:29:06,981 --> 00:29:08,780
- 45!

453
00:29:08,782 --> 00:29:09,881
- 45? This kid...

454
00:29:09,883 --> 00:29:11,352
- 45?

455
00:29:12,386 --> 00:29:14,186
Man.
- Whitehorse.

456
00:29:14,188 --> 00:29:15,988
- Arnie Whitehorse.
- Fuck.

457
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,022
- Alright.

458
00:29:17,024 --> 00:29:19,091
Let's go then.

459
00:29:20,828 --> 00:29:22,094
- Yo, let's go around the back.

460
00:29:22,096 --> 00:29:23,996
That guy was fucking...
- What'd you guys get?

461
00:29:23,998 --> 00:29:25,897
- Just wait till we get home.
- What is it?

462
00:29:25,899 --> 00:29:28,100
- Wait till we get home.
- What is this shit, bro?

463
00:29:28,102 --> 00:29:29,935
- What?
- This shit's fake as fuck.

464
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:31,537
What'd y'all give me?
What is this?

465
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:33,005
Fuck!

466
00:29:33,007 --> 00:29:34,074
- Run!

467
00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:37,845
- Dad! Dad!

468
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,913
Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad!
- What the fuck you doing here?

469
00:29:41,915 --> 00:29:43,348
- He's trying to beat us up!
- Who?

470
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,317
- That guy!
- What'd you do?

471
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:47,553
- I don't know what we did!
- What the fuck did you do?

472
00:29:47,555 --> 00:29:49,154
- Who, this guy?
That's my son.

473
00:29:49,156 --> 00:29:51,792
- That's your fuckin--

474
00:30:03,237 --> 00:30:05,472
- Yeah, that's my fucking son!
What's good, bitch?!

475
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,418
- You want some?

476
00:30:24,191 --> 00:30:25,859
- Right here then, WWE style.

477
00:31:08,268 --> 00:31:10,371
- Where were you?

478
00:31:12,439 --> 00:31:14,375
- I think I found a job.

479
00:31:15,376 --> 00:31:16,511
- Doing what?

480
00:31:17,612 --> 00:31:19,547
- Working for some white guy.

481
00:31:20,147 --> 00:31:23,217
I made like, 300 taking
some people home.

482
00:31:24,284 --> 00:31:26,084
- Like a taxi?

483
00:31:26,086 --> 00:31:27,421
- I don't know.

484
00:31:28,155 --> 00:31:29,154
I guess.

485
00:31:29,156 --> 00:31:31,325
But I'll be doing
more stuff, too.

486
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:33,392
- Well, good.

487
00:31:33,394 --> 00:31:35,127
You could bail Carly.

488
00:31:35,129 --> 00:31:37,131
The kid would be happy.

489
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,967
- He already looks happy.

490
00:31:41,969 --> 00:31:44,104
- That's 'cause he's sleeping.

491
00:33:28,242 --> 00:33:29,777
- I saw you dance before.

492
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:32,312
You're a really good dancer.

493
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,046
- Thanks.

494
00:33:35,048 --> 00:33:36,718
- Can I have a kiss?

495
00:33:45,593 --> 00:33:47,327
- Does it hurt?

496
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,397
- I'll be gentle.

497
00:33:52,767 --> 00:33:54,667
- I wasn't talking about that.

498
00:33:54,669 --> 00:33:57,269
- Oh. What were you
talking about?

499
00:33:57,271 --> 00:33:59,304
- Your face.
- Oh, shit.

500
00:33:59,306 --> 00:34:01,408
My bad.

501
00:34:05,513 --> 00:34:07,078
- Um..

502
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,049
I don't want to do it here.

503
00:34:09,851 --> 00:34:11,586
- Okay.

504
00:34:24,431 --> 00:34:25,665
- Come here.

505
00:34:25,667 --> 00:34:27,299
- Man, you're really goofy, huh?

506
00:34:27,301 --> 00:34:28,636
- You still love me.

507
00:34:29,169 --> 00:34:30,803
Why don't you come outside?

508
00:34:30,805 --> 00:34:32,203
- Holy fuck.
- What?

509
00:34:32,205 --> 00:34:33,606
- What the fuck is that?

510
00:34:33,608 --> 00:34:35,307
- What do you mean?
What do you mean,

511
00:34:35,309 --> 00:34:37,142
what is it? It's a poodle.

512
00:34:37,144 --> 00:34:38,744
- I know it's a fucking
poodle, you idiot.

513
00:34:38,746 --> 00:34:40,345
Where'd you even get her at?

514
00:34:40,347 --> 00:34:42,314
- Does it really matter?
- You probably stole it.

515
00:34:42,316 --> 00:34:43,883
- What makes you think
I stole it?

516
00:34:43,885 --> 00:34:45,751
Don't be thinking like that.

517
00:34:45,753 --> 00:34:47,152
I bought it.

518
00:34:47,154 --> 00:34:48,688
- The most goofiest shit
I've ever heard.

519
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:51,289
Only you would buy some white
lady-type dog, I swear.

520
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:53,224
- I'm gonna tell everybody
that she's yours

521
00:34:53,226 --> 00:34:54,594
so I don't look like a pussy.

522
00:34:54,596 --> 00:34:56,662
- Fuck no, you better not tell
nobody that's my dog.

523
00:34:56,664 --> 00:34:58,598
- Why not?
- Why would you even buy it?

524
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,199
Why the fuck would you even
invest in something like this?

525
00:35:01,201 --> 00:35:02,868
- 'Cause, you know,
it's not just mine.
It's yours too.

526
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:04,537
- So, what?
What do you plan to do?

527
00:35:04,539 --> 00:35:06,806
- I don't know.
What do you want to do with it?

528
00:35:06,808 --> 00:35:08,473
It's half yours.
- I can't take care

529
00:35:08,475 --> 00:35:10,308
of no fucking dog, Bill.
- That's alright.

530
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:13,280
She's hella great, though.
She could make us rich.

531
00:35:13,581 --> 00:35:15,413
Buy you that car.

532
00:35:15,415 --> 00:35:17,315
Buy you some new clothes.

533
00:35:17,317 --> 00:35:19,284
I'mma get us a trailer
and give you more baby boys.

534
00:35:19,286 --> 00:35:21,587
- Oh, you're a fucking rat.

535
00:35:21,589 --> 00:35:23,556
- And you're beautiful.
- Yeah?

536
00:35:23,558 --> 00:35:25,425
- Mm-hmm. You know...

537
00:35:29,396 --> 00:35:30,665
- So, what's up?

538
00:35:34,769 --> 00:35:36,470
- She wants you to come outside.

539
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:39,538
I want you to come outside.

540
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:42,307
Please?
- You're fucking crazy.

541
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:44,710
- You need some help?
- No, I'm good.

542
00:35:44,712 --> 00:35:45,880
- All right.

543
00:35:46,246 --> 00:35:48,814
- Oh, shit.
- Here, can you hold this?

544
00:35:48,816 --> 00:35:49,915
- For what?

545
00:35:49,917 --> 00:35:51,884
- Because you're gonna
stay with me.

546
00:36:47,407 --> 00:36:49,510
- Oh, my God.

547
00:37:14,001 --> 00:37:15,970
- Yo, what the fuck did you do?

548
00:37:16,571 --> 00:37:19,437
You really think I would notice,
you stupid little fuck?!

549
00:37:19,439 --> 00:37:20,840
Fuck you!
Look at me!

550
00:37:20,842 --> 00:37:22,708
Look at me!

551
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,810
Fight back!
Fight back, bitch!

552
00:37:24,812 --> 00:37:26,011
Fight back!

553
00:37:27,682 --> 00:37:28,948
You're a bitch!
Fight me!

554
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:31,349
You're gonna get me
fucking killed!

555
00:37:31,351 --> 00:37:33,351
Fight back.
Come on, son.

556
00:37:33,353 --> 00:37:34,754
You putting salt
in my fucking shit!

557
00:37:34,756 --> 00:37:36,389
You think I wouldn't notice it?

558
00:38:02,784 --> 00:38:05,019
Get the fuck out of my house.

559
00:38:05,586 --> 00:38:07,487
I don't want you here no more.

560
00:39:22,897 --> 00:39:24,431
- Hey, Bill!

561
00:39:24,966 --> 00:39:26,399
Come on up!

562
00:39:40,447 --> 00:39:41,716
- Here you go.

563
00:40:07,675 --> 00:40:09,108
Okay.

564
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,976
So, the whole point of wine,

565
00:40:10,978 --> 00:40:14,079
Bill, is sipping it slowly

566
00:40:14,081 --> 00:40:16,181
so you can enjoy it.

567
00:40:16,183 --> 00:40:18,784
- Oh, shit.
Thank you.

568
00:40:18,786 --> 00:40:20,219
- Mm-hmm.

569
00:40:20,221 --> 00:40:24,023
- So, do you have any holiday
plans this year?

570
00:40:24,025 --> 00:40:26,692
- Hmm. Not really.

571
00:40:26,694 --> 00:40:29,797
Probably just try
to hang out with my kids.

572
00:40:30,197 --> 00:40:32,066
- I didn't know you had kids.

573
00:40:33,534 --> 00:40:35,466
- Mm-hmm. I got two sons.

574
00:40:35,468 --> 00:40:36,802
- Wow.

575
00:40:36,804 --> 00:40:38,639
Two sons.

576
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,106
That's amazing.
- So listen, Bill.

577
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:44,810
We own Fall River Farms
and there's a bunch of positions

578
00:40:44,812 --> 00:40:48,180
opening up at the plant
and I was thinking

579
00:40:48,182 --> 00:40:49,915
we could get you started
over there

580
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:51,583
because I know
you could do with more work.

581
00:40:51,585 --> 00:40:53,118
- So adorable.
- What do you think?

582
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,855
- Yeah, I'd appreciate that.

583
00:40:55,323 --> 00:40:58,691
- Thanksgiving is obviously
our busiest time of year

584
00:40:58,693 --> 00:41:01,492
and we're providing
to three new suppliers this year

585
00:41:01,494 --> 00:41:03,864
which is huge for us.
- Huge.

586
00:41:05,566 --> 00:41:06,732
- Yeah.

587
00:41:06,734 --> 00:41:08,600
- Yeah, Bill.

588
00:41:08,602 --> 00:41:10,235
Bill should help with Halloween.

589
00:41:10,237 --> 00:41:11,971
- Oh, okay.

590
00:41:11,973 --> 00:41:14,006
- Yeah, because last year,

591
00:41:14,008 --> 00:41:17,943
we hired this Mexican company
from Rapid and, well,

592
00:41:17,945 --> 00:41:20,012
one of the employees
pooped on our lawn.

593
00:41:20,014 --> 00:41:22,915
- Okay, honey.
It wasn't a Mexican thing.

594
00:41:22,917 --> 00:41:24,616
It was just a bad manners thing.

595
00:41:24,618 --> 00:41:26,919
- No, he was Mexican.

596
00:41:26,921 --> 00:41:28,220
- He just happened
to be Mexican.

597
00:41:28,222 --> 00:41:30,723
That's not why...
I mean, come on.

598
00:41:30,725 --> 00:41:32,825
- We can laugh about it now.

599
00:41:32,827 --> 00:41:35,060
Like I'm laughing,
but at the time,

600
00:41:35,062 --> 00:41:36,662
it really wasn't that funny.

601
00:41:36,664 --> 00:41:38,731
- Look, someone shat
on our lawn,

602
00:41:38,733 --> 00:41:41,900
who happened
to be Mexican, okay?

603
00:41:41,902 --> 00:41:44,937
Anyway, I'd still love
to keep you around the house

604
00:41:44,939 --> 00:41:48,140
doing personal stuff
if you'd be open to, you know,

605
00:41:48,142 --> 00:41:51,610
having two jobs, but we don't
need to get into all that today.

606
00:41:51,612 --> 00:41:53,681
- Oh, my gosh.
Who's this little doggie?

607
00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:56,548
- Oh, that's Beast.
I'm breeding her,

608
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,684
trying to start my own business.

609
00:41:58,686 --> 00:42:00,185
- Beast?

610
00:42:00,187 --> 00:42:02,187
That's an interesting name.

611
00:42:02,189 --> 00:42:03,322
- Yeah. My son named her,

612
00:42:03,324 --> 00:42:04,823
so no rez dogs
would fuck with her.

613
00:42:04,825 --> 00:42:07,559
I love that.

614
00:42:07,561 --> 00:42:10,829
You really are... You're just,
you're so different.

615
00:42:10,831 --> 00:42:12,931
- He's smart, honey.

616
00:42:12,933 --> 00:42:15,034
Unlike most of
the other guys around here.

617
00:42:15,036 --> 00:42:16,769
- Oh, who is this?

618
00:42:16,771 --> 00:42:18,704
- Someone that's dead to me.

619
00:42:18,706 --> 00:42:21,208
- Oh, sweetie.
I'm so sorry.

620
00:42:21,709 --> 00:42:23,242
- No, it's all right.

621
00:42:23,244 --> 00:42:25,010
- No, no, it isn't.

622
00:42:25,012 --> 00:42:27,312
You poor thing.
When did she pass?

623
00:42:27,314 --> 00:42:28,816
- Huh?

624
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,785
- When did she die?

625
00:42:31,218 --> 00:42:33,318
- We just broke up.

626
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,254
- Oh!

627
00:42:35,256 --> 00:42:37,656
I thought she died.

628
00:42:37,658 --> 00:42:40,027
- All right, Bill.
So what did you do?

629
00:42:41,328 --> 00:42:42,795
- Nothing.
- Come on.

630
00:42:42,797 --> 00:42:45,364
You must have done something.
- Nothing.

631
00:42:45,366 --> 00:42:46,899
- Nothing at all, huh?

632
00:42:46,901 --> 00:42:48,967
- See, this is
my new girlfriend.

633
00:42:48,969 --> 00:42:50,369
We also got a kid together.

634
00:42:50,371 --> 00:42:51,872
- Aww.
- Wow.

635
00:42:52,541 --> 00:42:55,040
Well, you want
to hang onto that one,

636
00:42:55,042 --> 00:42:56,842
buy her lots of presents.

637
00:42:56,844 --> 00:42:58,744
Tell her she's always right.

638
00:42:58,746 --> 00:43:00,612
Trust me with this.

639
00:43:00,614 --> 00:43:01,816
Let me tell you something.

640
00:43:02,183 --> 00:43:04,349
If there were no women
in the world,

641
00:43:04,351 --> 00:43:06,687
money would have no meaning.

642
00:43:09,623 --> 00:43:12,291
Matter of fact, Allie,
why don't you take Bill up

643
00:43:12,293 --> 00:43:14,359
to your jewelry box
and give him something

644
00:43:14,361 --> 00:43:16,628
you don't wear anymore
so he can give it to...

645
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,864
What's her name, Bill?
- Echo.

646
00:43:18,866 --> 00:43:20,332
- Ethyl?
- Echo.

647
00:43:20,334 --> 00:43:22,935
- Echo?
- Echo.

648
00:43:22,937 --> 00:43:26,705
- These I got from Alaska.

649
00:43:26,707 --> 00:43:27,973
- Cool.

650
00:43:27,975 --> 00:43:30,008
- But you don't want
these, though.

651
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:32,379
- Why?
- They have bad juju.

652
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,618
Me and Tim, we almost got
divorced that trip.

653
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,856
We almost get divorced
a lot, but...

654
00:43:42,323 --> 00:43:47,795
Um... I think
Echo would like these.

655
00:43:48,729 --> 00:43:50,028
Dreamcatchers.

656
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:51,332
- Hmm.

657
00:43:51,765 --> 00:43:54,032
What about those ones?

658
00:43:54,034 --> 00:43:55,736
- Uh... These?

659
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:58,137
You picked my favorite.

660
00:43:58,139 --> 00:43:59,438
- You just gonna give them
to me?

661
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,406
- Yeah. I'm just
gonna give them to you.

662
00:44:01,408 --> 00:44:03,742
- Wow. Thank you.

663
00:44:03,744 --> 00:44:05,880
- So, anything else?

664
00:44:06,914 --> 00:44:08,714
- No, I'm alright.

665
00:44:08,716 --> 00:44:09,984
- Okay, great.

666
00:44:47,188 --> 00:44:48,822
- I got you this.

667
00:44:49,123 --> 00:44:50,457
- Hi.

668
00:44:51,992 --> 00:44:53,859
- I need some place to stay.

669
00:44:53,861 --> 00:44:55,129
- Why?

670
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:57,798
- My dad kicked me
out of the house.

671
00:44:59,066 --> 00:45:00,267
- Okay.

672
00:45:06,173 --> 00:45:08,943
I got three rules if you're
gonna be staying here with me.

673
00:45:09,443 --> 00:45:11,045
No fighting in the house.

674
00:45:11,946 --> 00:45:15,480
Keep it real with me, and you
gotta go to school every day.

675
00:45:15,482 --> 00:45:17,950
Go ahead and get comfortable.
Pick a shelf.

676
00:45:17,952 --> 00:45:19,720
This is where
you're gonna be staying.

677
00:45:20,888 --> 00:45:23,224
Don't bring no drama
into my tipi, okay?

678
00:45:23,525 --> 00:45:24,792
- Okay.

679
00:45:43,811 --> 00:45:45,077
Thanks.

680
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:47,047
- Coffee time.
- Thanks.

681
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,168
- It ain't him.

682
00:47:03,357 --> 00:47:04,592
- Whoa.

683
00:47:06,594 --> 00:47:08,393
- I'm still mad at you.

684
00:47:08,395 --> 00:47:09,997
- I know.

685
00:47:11,065 --> 00:47:12,534
But you love me.

686
00:47:13,067 --> 00:47:15,603
Everything's gonna be
different this time.

687
00:48:12,126 --> 00:48:13,358
- No, keep it.

688
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,662
Keep it.

689
00:48:20,434 --> 00:48:21,669
You alright?

690
00:48:23,337 --> 00:48:24,338
- Yeah.

691
00:48:45,259 --> 00:48:46,726
- So how'd you get the job? Tim?

692
00:48:46,728 --> 00:48:48,328
- Yeah.

693
00:48:49,096 --> 00:48:52,030
- This is one turkey shed
over here,

694
00:48:52,032 --> 00:48:55,369
then there's like,
three or four down that way.

695
00:48:56,970 --> 00:49:00,105
All right, they might be
a little loud, so beware.

696
00:49:00,107 --> 00:49:01,541
- Alright.
- They're crazy, too.

697
00:49:01,543 --> 00:49:03,041
Rowdy. Really rowdy.

698
00:49:03,043 --> 00:49:05,010
Been locked up 24/7.

699
00:49:06,346 --> 00:49:08,382
You got asthma?
- No.

700
00:49:11,452 --> 00:49:13,452
- This is the turkey jerky room.

701
00:49:13,454 --> 00:49:15,086
This is the layout.

702
00:49:15,088 --> 00:49:17,122
The snipping.

703
00:49:17,124 --> 00:49:18,423
The weighing.

704
00:49:18,425 --> 00:49:21,059
This is probably
where you will start out.

705
00:49:21,061 --> 00:49:23,497
And then, we have
the packaging back there.

706
00:49:25,065 --> 00:49:26,133
Yeah.

707
00:49:39,346 --> 00:49:40,580
- Hello?

708
00:49:40,582 --> 00:49:42,414
<i>- This is a prepaid</i>
<i>call from...</i>

709
00:49:42,416 --> 00:49:44,517
<i>- Carly. Pick up</i>
<i>the phone, bitch.</i>

710
00:50:02,537 --> 00:50:04,104
- Sit.

711
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:08,041
Come on, girl. Sit.

712
00:50:09,042 --> 00:50:10,141
Beast.

713
00:50:10,143 --> 00:50:11,211
Please!

714
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:12,747
Sit.

715
00:51:33,126 --> 00:51:35,493
Let's go! Let's go!

716
00:51:35,495 --> 00:51:37,364
Let's go!

717
00:52:13,635 --> 00:52:16,802
- Hey, you need to come get her.
She's not feeling great.

718
00:52:16,804 --> 00:52:18,271
- Like how?

719
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,238
Is she okay?

720
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,641
- Yeah, I don't fucking know.

721
00:52:21,643 --> 00:52:23,776
She was like this
when I picked her up.

722
00:52:23,778 --> 00:52:25,680
You just need
to get her out of here.

723
00:52:26,413 --> 00:52:27,882
- That's not good.

724
00:52:28,482 --> 00:52:31,218
Well, fuck.
What am I supposed to do?

725
00:52:31,919 --> 00:52:34,787
- Um, it's up to her.

726
00:52:34,789 --> 00:52:36,555
Whatever she wants.

727
00:52:49,704 --> 00:52:50,903
- Hey.

728
00:52:50,905 --> 00:52:52,404
Hey!

729
00:52:52,406 --> 00:52:53,741
I think this is it.

730
00:53:42,023 --> 00:53:43,958
I don't speak Lakota.

731
00:56:35,663 --> 00:56:36,797
- Matho.

732
00:56:42,703 --> 00:56:44,605
- We've been looking
all over for you.

733
00:56:48,743 --> 00:56:49,810
- What?

734
00:56:52,613 --> 00:56:54,081
- Bro, I'm sorry
to tell you this.

735
00:56:54,715 --> 00:56:56,984
They found your dad
in the creek.

736
00:57:01,622 --> 00:57:02,957
- I'm sorry.

737
00:57:08,796 --> 00:57:10,531
<i>- I'm finally home.</i>

738
00:57:11,198 --> 00:57:13,766
I gazed upon the Lord's sweet,

739
00:57:13,768 --> 00:57:15,569
smiling face...

740
00:57:16,737 --> 00:57:19,540
And for the first time
in my life...

741
00:57:21,042 --> 00:57:24,812
I knew and felt His grace.

742
00:58:35,883 --> 00:58:37,752
- Can I have a cigarette?

743
00:59:31,138 --> 00:59:32,871
- Hey, I'm gonna head out.

744
00:59:32,873 --> 00:59:34,273
- Hey, Bill.

745
00:59:34,275 --> 00:59:36,310
Come here.
Share this glass with me.

746
00:59:51,225 --> 00:59:52,660
Goddamn.

747
01:00:18,252 --> 01:00:20,154
- What's up?

748
01:00:21,422 --> 01:00:23,322
- Who the fuck let you out?

749
01:00:23,324 --> 01:00:25,292
- Long time, no see, bitch.

750
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:28,295
Where's my money at?

751
01:00:29,363 --> 01:00:31,096
- Shit.

752
01:00:31,098 --> 01:00:33,065
I don't know where that shit is.

753
01:00:33,067 --> 01:00:35,000
- Well, I heard you got
an expensive new dog

754
01:00:35,002 --> 01:00:37,169
and a fancy job,
so you must have some money.

755
01:00:37,171 --> 01:00:38,806
- Are you mad at me?

756
01:00:39,173 --> 01:00:40,272
- No.

757
01:00:40,274 --> 01:00:42,409
I don't expect much from you.

758
01:00:43,177 --> 01:00:44,712
- Ugh...

759
01:00:45,446 --> 01:00:47,281
- What you mean, "Ugh?"

760
01:00:48,782 --> 01:00:51,350
- Like, "Ugh, why can't you
just be nice to me?"

761
01:00:51,352 --> 01:00:53,154
- You're fucking weird, man.

762
01:00:55,156 --> 01:00:56,323
What's that?

763
01:00:57,725 --> 01:00:59,291
- It's some wine.

764
01:00:59,293 --> 01:01:01,260
- Look at you trying to act
all brand new and shit.

765
01:01:01,262 --> 01:01:03,797
- I just got some
acquired taste.

766
01:01:11,305 --> 01:01:13,805
Oh, I gotta fucking throw up.

767
01:01:17,111 --> 01:01:18,911
- I ain't fucking playing
with you, Bill.

768
01:01:18,913 --> 01:01:20,312
Man, I want my fucking money.

769
01:01:20,314 --> 01:01:21,849
- Bet. Oh...

770
01:01:46,207 --> 01:01:48,075
- Come on, Bill. Get up.

771
01:02:11,031 --> 01:02:13,267
- What?
- Nothing.

772
01:02:17,539 --> 01:02:19,338
- Hurry up. I gotta go.

773
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:20,839
- Who gave you
all those hickeys?

774
01:02:20,841 --> 01:02:22,142
Huh?

775
01:02:22,544 --> 01:02:23,911
Fuck!

776
01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:30,351
Where's Beast?

777
01:02:30,719 --> 01:02:32,219
- I don't know.

778
01:02:32,554 --> 01:02:35,356
- Well, what about Carly?
- I have no clue.

779
01:02:36,323 --> 01:02:37,992
- Oh, my God.

780
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,395
- Fucking idiot.

781
01:02:41,829 --> 01:02:44,830
- Hey, did you guys see my dog?
- No.

782
01:02:50,938 --> 01:02:52,072
- Hello?

783
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:57,144
Yeah, I could do that.

784
01:03:27,074 --> 01:03:28,909
- Stop doing that.

785
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,448
Could I use the bathroom?

786
01:03:49,863 --> 01:03:51,365
Watch the fuck out!

787
01:04:30,237 --> 01:04:31,338
What's up?

788
01:04:34,975 --> 01:04:35,976
- Hey.

789
01:04:38,445 --> 01:04:40,180
Hey, Matho.

790
01:04:42,216 --> 01:04:43,384
Matho!

791
01:04:49,423 --> 01:04:51,123
- Get out of there!

792
01:04:51,125 --> 01:04:52,527
Hustle!

793
01:05:07,341 --> 01:05:09,343
Boy, go on!
Get out of here!

794
01:05:13,347 --> 01:05:15,981
- Ah. There you are!
Don't run, now.

795
01:05:15,983 --> 01:05:17,949
Don't run. Relax, now.
Relax. Relax.

796
01:05:17,951 --> 01:05:19,251
Relax, now.

797
01:05:19,253 --> 01:05:21,554
We'll go to the office, okay?

798
01:05:21,556 --> 01:05:23,155
Let's find out what
the trouble is.

799
01:05:23,157 --> 01:05:25,390
Relax, now. Okay?

800
01:05:25,392 --> 01:05:26,994
All right, we're gonna go.

801
01:05:55,623 --> 01:05:57,525
<i>- It's Carly.</i>
<i>Leave me a message.</i>

802
01:06:03,163 --> 01:06:05,499
- You want some turkey jerky?
- No.

803
01:06:07,735 --> 01:06:09,702
- Well, we're going to have
to make a short stop.

804
01:06:09,704 --> 01:06:11,138
- How short?

805
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:18,043
- Where's Carly at?
- Jail.

806
01:06:18,045 --> 01:06:19,579
They took her back this morning.

807
01:06:19,581 --> 01:06:21,714
- Well, did you see my dog?
- No.

808
01:06:24,017 --> 01:06:25,551
- What the fuck do you want?

809
01:06:25,553 --> 01:06:27,154
- Motherfucker,
my motherfucking dog!

810
01:06:27,655 --> 01:06:29,421
- I sold your little
bitch ass dog.

811
01:06:29,423 --> 01:06:31,557
- Sold him to who?
- To the only other motherfucker

812
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:34,292
down here that's dumb enough
to sell fucking poodles
on the fucking rez.

813
01:06:34,294 --> 01:06:36,194
- Man, you shouldn't even be
taking people's shit like that.

814
01:06:36,196 --> 01:06:37,630
- You know what?
That's pretty fucking funny

815
01:06:37,632 --> 01:06:39,231
coming from your little
bitch ass, Bill.

816
01:06:39,233 --> 01:06:41,233
You left me in jail to go buy
a fucking dog,

817
01:06:41,235 --> 01:06:43,803
so stay in your little fucked up
lane, alright? Fuck you.

818
01:06:43,805 --> 01:06:45,105
- Ooh.

819
01:06:57,519 --> 01:06:58,586
Come on.

820
01:07:15,837 --> 01:07:18,069
- What are you doing? You can't
drive with him like this.

821
01:07:18,071 --> 01:07:19,170
- Why?

822
01:07:19,172 --> 01:07:20,806
- Because he don't
have a car seat.

823
01:07:20,808 --> 01:07:22,575
Yeah, I don't have a car seat.

824
01:07:22,577 --> 01:07:23,809
- Well, then maybe
you shouldn't be driving

825
01:07:23,811 --> 01:07:25,545
with him in the first place.
- Oh, my God.

826
01:07:25,547 --> 01:07:27,312
Listen, I like that you care,

827
01:07:27,314 --> 01:07:29,383
but can you just mind your damn
business for five minutes?

828
01:07:30,417 --> 01:07:33,151
Hey, I need you to watch Mason.
- Where are you going?

829
01:07:33,153 --> 01:07:34,654
- I have to go find
Beast real quick.

830
01:07:34,656 --> 01:07:37,623
- Oh, no, no no.
I have to go to the
volleyball game.

831
01:07:37,625 --> 01:07:39,525
- It'll take an hour.
I'll be right back, okay?

832
01:07:39,527 --> 01:07:41,293
I'm sorry.
- Hey, come on, now.

833
01:07:41,295 --> 01:07:42,730
You're such a butthead.

834
01:07:45,265 --> 01:07:46,599
- Has anybody got a taser?

835
01:07:46,601 --> 01:07:48,568
- What the fuck are you going
to do with a taser

836
01:07:48,570 --> 01:07:51,202
if she has a gun?
- Shit, bro. You ever get tased?

837
01:07:51,204 --> 01:07:52,607
That shit hurts worse,
more than a bullet.

838
01:08:17,364 --> 01:08:18,430
- Hello?

839
01:08:34,015 --> 01:08:35,347
Hey, yo.

840
01:08:35,349 --> 01:08:36,851
Where's my dog at?

841
01:08:37,552 --> 01:08:38,553
Yo!

842
01:08:39,453 --> 01:08:40,686
- What?

843
01:08:40,688 --> 01:08:42,487
- I said, where's my dog at?

844
01:08:42,489 --> 01:08:43,756
- I don't fucking know, man.

845
01:08:43,758 --> 01:08:46,291
Why the fuck is everyone
coming at me today for?

846
01:08:46,293 --> 01:08:48,259
- I'm just looking for my dog.

847
01:08:48,261 --> 01:08:49,795
I'm not trying
to come at you, bro.

848
01:08:49,797 --> 01:08:51,731
- Look, if y'all don't know the
fucking poodle business, man,

849
01:08:51,733 --> 01:08:53,566
there's nothing
I can do for you.

850
01:08:53,568 --> 01:08:55,233
So, can you please
get the fuck out?

851
01:08:55,235 --> 01:08:57,202
- Oh, all right.

852
01:08:57,204 --> 01:08:59,206
Chill, bro.
I'm gone, alright?

853
01:09:08,583 --> 01:09:11,449
She had her babies? Yes!

854
01:09:11,451 --> 01:09:13,153
Go. Go get the boys.

855
01:09:20,795 --> 01:09:22,262
Goddamn.

856
01:09:24,732 --> 01:09:26,266
What did you even do?

857
01:09:31,338 --> 01:09:33,508
Help me get these in. Yeah.

858
01:09:34,374 --> 01:09:35,810
Look what you did.

859
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:41,379
- One, two, three, four, five...

860
01:09:41,381 --> 01:09:43,450
six, seven, eight, nine.

861
01:09:44,317 --> 01:09:45,450
- Shh. Be quiet.

862
01:09:45,452 --> 01:09:47,320
- That's $18,000.
- Shh!

863
01:09:50,558 --> 01:09:51,926
- She's cute.

864
01:09:54,896 --> 01:09:56,496
- Look, it gots waves.

865
01:09:59,767 --> 01:10:01,299
Oh, I missed you.

866
01:10:01,301 --> 01:10:02,570
Where'd you go?

867
01:10:11,913 --> 01:10:13,280
- Hello?

868
01:10:21,989 --> 01:10:23,524
- Come on, come on.

869
01:10:24,959 --> 01:10:27,893
<i>The Bible tells us</i>
<i>to rejoice in hope,</i>

870
01:10:27,895 --> 01:10:30,730
<i>to be patient in tribulation.</i>

871
01:10:30,732 --> 01:10:35,402
<i>There's a lot of problems</i>
<i>in our country and...</i>

872
01:10:36,704 --> 01:10:38,305
<i>I don't...</i>

873
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:41,943
<i>God knows that, and so do we.</i>

874
01:10:42,710 --> 01:10:45,878
<i>If we look at creation, and we</i>
<i>look at everything around...</i>

875
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:47,278
- What the fuck is this?

876
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,683
- They didn't give you
extra pineapple?

877
01:10:49,517 --> 01:10:50,850
- Fuck, I told them.

878
01:10:50,852 --> 01:10:52,685
- Hey, bro.
My dad will go back in there

879
01:10:52,687 --> 01:10:54,319
if they forgot
the extra pineapple

880
01:10:54,321 --> 01:10:55,921
and they'll just
put them on for free.

881
01:10:55,923 --> 01:10:58,023
- Let me have some.
- Alright, man.

882
01:10:58,025 --> 01:10:59,491
- I didn't have none.

883
01:10:59,493 --> 01:11:01,763
<i>- ...that'll save you,</i>
<i>it'll save me.</i>

884
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:03,931
<i>It'll save all of us.</i>

885
01:11:06,801 --> 01:11:08,035
- What's up?

886
01:11:11,404 --> 01:11:13,941
Well, why have you been
leaving me on seen?

887
01:11:15,076 --> 01:11:17,743
- Is it true you got
suspended for meth?

888
01:11:17,745 --> 01:11:19,912
- Who said that?
- Thelma.

889
01:11:19,914 --> 01:11:22,347
- Well, nay.
That's not even true.

890
01:11:22,349 --> 01:11:24,083
- What'd you get suspended for?

891
01:11:24,085 --> 01:11:25,785
- Why do you care?

892
01:11:25,787 --> 01:11:28,419
- My mom said I'm not allowed
to hang around you anymore.

893
01:11:28,421 --> 01:11:30,890
- Why?
- Because she don't trust you.

894
01:11:30,892 --> 01:11:33,559
- Well, she don't even know me.
Tell her to invite me over.

895
01:11:33,561 --> 01:11:35,761
- I don't even want to be
with you anymore.

896
01:11:35,763 --> 01:11:37,763
- We're not even together.
I only snagged you
that one time.

897
01:11:37,765 --> 01:11:38,964
- Save it,
because you're disgusting.

898
01:11:38,966 --> 01:11:40,431
I ain't trying to be
with someone

899
01:11:40,433 --> 01:11:41,700
who can't even
get through high school.

900
01:11:41,702 --> 01:11:43,503
- Well, fuck you, bitch.

901
01:11:47,374 --> 01:11:49,309
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

902
01:12:17,738 --> 01:12:19,439
- Why are you home from school?

903
01:12:20,041 --> 01:12:22,442
- I think I'm sick.
I don't feel good.

904
01:12:23,144 --> 01:12:24,512
- Hmm.

905
01:12:47,802 --> 01:12:49,537
What kind of sick are you?

906
01:12:51,572 --> 01:12:54,809
- My stomach kind of hurts,
and I have a sore throat.

907
01:13:04,417 --> 01:13:05,853
- What are my rules?

908
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:08,754
- Don't lie.

909
01:13:08,756 --> 01:13:10,024
- Speak up.

910
01:13:12,193 --> 01:13:14,896
- Don't lie, don't fight,
and go to school.

911
01:13:18,532 --> 01:13:20,534
- They called my house phone.

912
01:13:25,172 --> 01:13:27,041
- I'll work for you for free.

913
01:13:28,209 --> 01:13:30,009
- Excuse me?

914
01:13:30,011 --> 01:13:32,711
- If you let me stay,
I'll work for you for free.

915
01:13:32,713 --> 01:13:34,880
- Okay, listen.
You got in trouble,

916
01:13:34,882 --> 01:13:36,515
and you told me
you're staying with me,

917
01:13:36,517 --> 01:13:38,617
and now you got the whole school
paying attention to me.

918
01:13:38,619 --> 01:13:39,852
You can't work for me at all.

919
01:13:39,854 --> 01:13:42,154
- But they didn't find anything.
I hid it.

920
01:13:42,156 --> 01:13:44,223
<i>That was the Buddy</i>
<i>Red Bow track there.</i>

921
01:13:44,225 --> 01:13:45,724
<i>I hope you guys enjoyed that.</i>

922
01:13:45,726 --> 01:13:47,026
- Get out.

923
01:13:47,028 --> 01:13:49,528
<i>- You're listening</i>
<i>to KILI radio...</i>

924
01:13:49,530 --> 01:13:51,464
- Can I eat first?

925
01:13:56,871 --> 01:13:58,438
Fuck.

926
01:14:11,686 --> 01:14:13,552
- Yo, I have to get some gas.

927
01:14:13,554 --> 01:14:14,889
- Fuck.

928
01:14:15,523 --> 01:14:17,556
- Bro, what's wrong with you?
You mad at me?

929
01:14:17,558 --> 01:14:19,758
- No, you're too fucking
stupid to get mad at.

930
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:21,860
What do you mean by that?

931
01:14:21,862 --> 01:14:23,796
- You're fucking boring.

932
01:14:23,798 --> 01:14:25,531
You think you're interesting,
and you're not.

933
01:14:25,533 --> 01:14:27,266
Nobody gives a fuck about
your baby mamas

934
01:14:27,268 --> 01:14:29,234
or your fucking stupid
stolen dog.

935
01:14:29,236 --> 01:14:30,669
- Hey, man.
Don't call her stupid.

936
01:14:30,671 --> 01:14:32,571
She's not stupid.
You're stupid.

937
01:14:32,573 --> 01:14:34,206
- Alright. Well, text Tim.
Tell him I'm gonna be late.

938
01:14:34,208 --> 01:14:36,275
- What do you mean, text Tim?
Why don't you just text Tim

939
01:14:36,277 --> 01:14:37,710
if y'all are so close?

940
01:14:37,712 --> 01:14:39,979
- I never said we was close.

941
01:14:39,981 --> 01:14:41,880
- Alright, then. So what is it
that y'all be doing?

942
01:14:41,882 --> 01:14:44,016
What does he do?
Does he pay you or something?

943
01:14:44,018 --> 01:14:46,051
What's the deal?
- That's not your business.

944
01:14:46,053 --> 01:14:49,023
We just fucking kick it.
- You just kick it? Okay.

945
01:14:52,693 --> 01:14:55,763
You know that he has a lot
of girlfriends, right?

946
01:14:56,797 --> 01:14:57,999
- So?

947
01:14:59,133 --> 01:15:00,634
That's not my place.

948
01:15:10,978 --> 01:15:12,644
- Ah, fuck.

949
01:15:12,646 --> 01:15:13,812
- What's wrong?

950
01:15:13,814 --> 01:15:15,114
- She's about to trip.

951
01:15:15,116 --> 01:15:16,548
- What?
- Just stay in the car.

952
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:18,117
- I swear you're not playing
with a full deck.

953
01:15:18,119 --> 01:15:19,651
- Ah, I'm kilt now.

954
01:15:19,653 --> 01:15:21,120
- Fuck.
- Fuck.

955
01:15:21,122 --> 01:15:22,554
I don't like that
kinda energy, bro.

956
01:15:22,556 --> 01:15:24,123
- You're so fucking stupid.
- What?

957
01:15:24,125 --> 01:15:25,758
- What the fuck?
- Don't trip.

958
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,126
- What do you mean, don't trip?

959
01:15:27,128 --> 01:15:28,794
- Let's go. I'll explain.
- Explain what?

960
01:15:28,796 --> 01:15:30,229
- Beast got stolen.
- What?

961
01:15:30,231 --> 01:15:32,197
- Come on, Beast got stolen.
- Who's in your car, Bill?

962
01:15:32,199 --> 01:15:34,600
- It's a girl from work.
I have to give her a ride home

963
01:15:34,602 --> 01:15:36,568
- What do you mean a ride home?
- It's my job.

964
01:15:36,570 --> 01:15:38,904
- What kind of job requires
you have to give bitches rides?

965
01:15:38,906 --> 01:15:40,272
Why you pushing me like that?
- Come here.

966
01:15:40,274 --> 01:15:41,573
- Move! I gotta fucking go!

967
01:15:41,575 --> 01:15:43,142
- I need you to calm
the fuck down.

968
01:15:43,144 --> 01:15:45,244
- Wow. Look at your
fucking neck!

969
01:15:45,246 --> 01:15:46,779
- Man, you're fucking tripping.

970
01:15:46,781 --> 01:15:48,781
- Why the fuck you got
hickeys on your neck?

971
01:15:48,783 --> 01:15:50,049
- What?
- What?

972
01:15:50,051 --> 01:15:51,583
- What?
- Let's fucking go!

973
01:15:51,585 --> 01:15:53,085
- You're fucking gross!

974
01:15:53,087 --> 01:15:55,556
- Oh, my God.
- Are you taking me, or what?

975
01:15:56,057 --> 01:15:57,356
- Let me take you home.

976
01:15:57,358 --> 01:15:58,957
- What, with your other
fucking bitch?

977
01:15:58,959 --> 01:16:00,125
- Gross. I just met him

978
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:01,994
a couple hours ago, but okay.
- Shut up!

979
01:16:01,996 --> 01:16:03,128
- Get the fuck away from me.

980
01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:04,730
- Get in the car then.
- Fuck you!

981
01:16:04,732 --> 01:16:06,298
- Don't tell me
what the fuck to do.

982
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:08,167
- Go!
- You fucking go!

983
01:16:08,169 --> 01:16:10,369
- Go! Damn, you're in the car.

984
01:17:55,676 --> 01:17:58,911
- This sacrifice,
this ancient spell...

985
01:17:58,913 --> 01:18:00,946
I hope the land
receives it well.

986
01:18:00,948 --> 01:18:04,283
And so beneath
the moons descent,

987
01:18:04,285 --> 01:18:07,354
I hope my loved one
might rise again.

988
01:18:09,156 --> 01:18:11,990
- Wake up, wake up, wake up.

989
01:18:11,992 --> 01:18:13,892
What happened right here?

990
01:18:15,896 --> 01:18:17,763
You got bit?
- I did.

991
01:19:11,118 --> 01:19:12,319
- Matho!

992
01:19:13,555 --> 01:19:16,955
<i>- Yo, bro, I could ask</i>
<i>my grandma if you could</i>
<i>spend the night.</i>

993
01:19:16,957 --> 01:19:19,458
- I asked my mom,
but she wasn't into it.

994
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:22,129
- Bro, I'm good. I'll probably
just stay here for a bit.

995
01:19:24,365 --> 01:19:26,298
<i>- But, bro, it's boarded up.</i>

996
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:28,967
<i>- Well, I can maybe</i>
<i>go get some stuff,</i>

997
01:19:28,969 --> 01:19:31,403
<i>and go decorate it or something.</i>

998
01:19:31,405 --> 01:19:34,406
<i>- But where are you gonna get</i>
<i>furniture and all that stuff?</i>

999
01:19:34,408 --> 01:19:36,375
<i>- Maybe I'll just go</i>
<i>on the swap.</i>

1000
01:19:36,377 --> 01:19:39,179
<i>I only need some blankets</i>
<i>and a TV.</i>

1001
01:19:39,947 --> 01:19:43,951
<i>- I could call my auntie</i>
<i>and see if she has an old TV</i>
<i>she don't want no more.</i>

1002
01:19:45,219 --> 01:19:47,019
- Bro, if you want
to make it look nice,

1003
01:19:47,021 --> 01:19:48,887
<i>you could get some plants, too.</i>

1004
01:19:48,889 --> 01:19:51,557
<i>- Yeah, and maybe just like</i>
<i>a couch to sit on.</i>

1005
01:19:51,559 --> 01:19:54,226
<i>- Yeah, maybe from</i>
<i>the dollar store or somewhere.</i>

1006
01:19:54,228 --> 01:19:56,330
<i>- You could also just steal it.</i>

1007
01:20:38,573 --> 01:20:40,542
- It's broken.
- It is.

1008
01:20:41,408 --> 01:20:43,141
I gotta get that fixed.

1009
01:20:45,012 --> 01:20:46,947
I shocked you? My bad.

1010
01:20:56,190 --> 01:20:57,956
Oh, motherfucker.

1011
01:20:59,393 --> 01:21:00,595
Damn.

1012
01:21:03,163 --> 01:21:04,463
Hey.

1013
01:21:04,465 --> 01:21:05,966
- Echo!

1014
01:21:10,270 --> 01:21:11,903
- You locking me out now?

1015
01:21:11,905 --> 01:21:13,271
- What do you want, Bill?

1016
01:21:13,273 --> 01:21:15,209
- Beast had her puppies.

1017
01:21:17,344 --> 01:21:18,544
- Wow.

1018
01:21:18,546 --> 01:21:20,379
- Yo, could I talk
to you for a second?

1019
01:21:20,381 --> 01:21:22,247
- About what?
- I was just driving

1020
01:21:22,249 --> 01:21:24,282
that girl home, and I don't
even know her name

1021
01:21:24,284 --> 01:21:26,552
and I just wanted to tell you
that I'm getting promoted

1022
01:21:26,554 --> 01:21:28,621
at work too so I'll have
more money to help you.

1023
01:21:28,623 --> 01:21:31,089
- Anything else?
- What are you doing tonight?

1024
01:21:31,091 --> 01:21:33,091
- Why?
- Because I want to know.

1025
01:21:33,093 --> 01:21:34,562
- So I could watch Mason?

1026
01:21:35,396 --> 01:21:37,062
- No.

1027
01:21:37,064 --> 01:21:39,299
- I have a fucking kid, Bill.
What else would I be doing?

1028
01:21:42,604 --> 01:21:45,971
- Well, let me watch him.
Yeah, let me watch him.

1029
01:21:45,973 --> 01:21:47,540
It's Halloween.
Go out and have some fun.

1030
01:21:47,542 --> 01:21:50,175
- Don't you have work?
- No.

1031
01:21:50,177 --> 01:21:52,545
- Okay. That would help.

1032
01:21:52,547 --> 01:21:54,246
Thanks.

1033
01:21:54,248 --> 01:21:56,049
- Yeah, you're welcome.

1034
01:22:03,123 --> 01:22:04,458
You boys okay?

1035
01:22:05,292 --> 01:22:07,292
Okay, I'll be back
to check on you guys

1036
01:22:07,294 --> 01:22:09,361
every 10 minutes, alright?
- Yeah.

1037
01:22:09,363 --> 01:22:11,631
- I'll just be right over there.

1038
01:22:11,633 --> 01:22:13,365
Okay?
- Yeah.

1039
01:22:13,367 --> 01:22:15,369
- Watch out for your brother
and those puppies.

1040
01:22:16,069 --> 01:22:18,673
And you got Beast
to protect you, alright?

1041
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:20,941
All right, I love you.

1042
01:22:23,511 --> 01:22:25,010
- Love you.

1043
01:22:48,268 --> 01:22:49,535
- Hi.

1044
01:22:49,537 --> 01:22:50,670
- Hi.

1045
01:22:50,672 --> 01:22:52,103
- You guys look great.

1046
01:22:52,105 --> 01:22:54,039
Spooky.
- Thank you. You too.

1047
01:22:55,342 --> 01:22:57,710
- I'm Allison.
Bill, you know me.

1048
01:22:57,712 --> 01:22:59,779
- Nice to meet you.
- Alright, yep.

1049
01:22:59,781 --> 01:23:02,648
- So, you could help
these guys out.

1050
01:23:02,650 --> 01:23:04,282
They're catering.
- Um...

1051
01:23:04,284 --> 01:23:06,084
I got somebody coming tonight

1052
01:23:06,086 --> 01:23:08,053
that I think wants
to buy one of your pups.

1053
01:23:08,055 --> 01:23:09,755
- Man, no shit. For real?
- Yeah, man.

1054
01:23:09,757 --> 01:23:11,225
- Alright then.

1055
01:23:12,326 --> 01:23:17,364
- We have faders, we have all
these Halloween decorations...

1056
01:23:18,165 --> 01:23:19,399
- Let's go.

1057
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:35,048
- Bro, let's go.

1058
01:23:42,155 --> 01:23:44,389
- What the fuck you
looking at, man?

1059
01:23:53,433 --> 01:23:55,469
- Hey Bill,
could you take that for me?

1060
01:24:35,843 --> 01:24:37,777
- Man, you gotta have a mixer.

1061
01:24:37,779 --> 01:24:39,277
A chaser.

1062
01:24:39,279 --> 01:24:40,648
- It's kinda gross.

1063
01:24:59,734 --> 01:25:01,734
- Oh, damn.

1064
01:25:03,805 --> 01:25:06,106
- There's leftover back there.

1065
01:25:07,542 --> 01:25:09,709
- Sell this or drink it?

1066
01:25:10,845 --> 01:25:12,612
- Just drink it.
- Are we gonna sell this

1067
01:25:12,614 --> 01:25:14,114
or drink it?
- Drink it.

1068
01:25:16,884 --> 01:25:18,149
- Give me that.

1069
01:25:21,455 --> 01:25:22,824
- Scared me.

1070
01:25:31,599 --> 01:25:32,834
- What are you doing?

1071
01:25:35,202 --> 01:25:36,468
- Nothing.

1072
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:39,304
Just looking for some
bottles for upstairs.

1073
01:25:39,306 --> 01:25:42,777
- Oh, okay. Well,
don't let me interrupt you.

1074
01:25:48,116 --> 01:25:51,151
You know, I know about
his little girlfriends.

1075
01:25:52,419 --> 01:25:54,454
It's okay.
It's not like...

1076
01:25:54,989 --> 01:25:59,192
It's not like a thing.
We don't need to talk
about it or anything.

1077
01:25:59,927 --> 01:26:01,627
- Okay.

1078
01:26:01,629 --> 01:26:04,431
- But, like,
it's easier for him now.

1079
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:10,571
Because he has you,
who lives at the rez and...

1080
01:26:13,306 --> 01:26:18,478
Before, he was just finding
these girls on Facebook and...

1081
01:26:19,379 --> 01:26:22,748
- I don't... I don't know
nothing about that.

1082
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:25,520
- Oh. Well, I do.
I read his messages.

1083
01:26:29,724 --> 01:26:32,426
You know, and like...
I really don't get it.

1084
01:26:33,393 --> 01:26:37,863
I don't get it. Personally,
I don't really see the appeal,

1085
01:26:37,865 --> 01:26:39,965
if you know what I mean.

1086
01:26:39,967 --> 01:26:43,401
I don't know if he's got,
like, an Indian fetish

1087
01:26:43,403 --> 01:26:45,370
or they're the only ones
that he can con

1088
01:26:45,372 --> 01:26:46,806
into having sex with him.

1089
01:26:46,808 --> 01:26:49,276
- Like I said, I don't know
anything about that.

1090
01:26:50,277 --> 01:26:51,879
- But like, technically...

1091
01:26:53,548 --> 01:26:55,983
Technically, you're like
sex trafficking.

1092
01:26:56,651 --> 01:26:59,554
And you could go
to jail for that.

1093
01:27:02,657 --> 01:27:05,323
And you know, like,
you know that you're not...

1094
01:27:05,325 --> 01:27:07,528
You're not any different
from them.

1095
01:27:17,872 --> 01:27:19,941
- I think I better
get back to work.

1096
01:27:41,294 --> 01:27:43,030
- Let's go. Nobody saw.

1097
01:27:49,537 --> 01:27:50,838
- What are we doing?

1098
01:27:52,507 --> 01:27:54,640
- My Auntie's not coming
back tonight.

1099
01:27:54,642 --> 01:27:55,941
- Where is she?

1100
01:27:55,943 --> 01:27:57,843
- They're all gone
for the weekend.

1101
01:27:57,845 --> 01:27:59,446
- How do you know
she's not coming back?

1102
01:28:01,549 --> 01:28:03,414
- Come on. Get in there.
- Okay.

1103
01:28:03,416 --> 01:28:04,950
- What are we gonna get?

1104
01:28:04,952 --> 01:28:06,585
- Look for the blue bag.

1105
01:28:06,587 --> 01:28:08,587
She keeps all her guns
and meth in there.

1106
01:28:08,589 --> 01:28:11,590
- Wait, what are we getting?
- Shh, shut the fuck up.

1107
01:28:11,592 --> 01:28:14,427
Just find the blue bag.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1108
01:28:15,696 --> 01:28:17,497
- Here. Yes, yes, yes.

1109
01:28:19,801 --> 01:28:21,334
- Hustle.

1110
01:28:55,468 --> 01:28:57,136
- This one.
- Yeah!

1111
01:28:57,138 --> 01:28:58,773
Let's go.

1112
01:29:00,741 --> 01:29:02,141
- Alright, here you go.

1113
01:29:02,143 --> 01:29:03,676
<i>Screwdriver</i>
<i>in the ignition.</i>

1114
01:29:03,678 --> 01:29:05,376
- Put it in the ignition.

1115
01:29:08,850 --> 01:29:11,449
Try turning it into the...

1116
01:29:11,451 --> 01:29:12,952
There you go.

1117
01:29:14,856 --> 01:29:15,990
Ooh!

1118
01:29:16,791 --> 01:29:17,857
Holy fuck.

1119
01:29:17,859 --> 01:29:18,858
Fucking fruit.

1120
01:29:18,860 --> 01:29:20,626
- I know.
- Weirdo.

1121
01:29:20,628 --> 01:29:21,996
- Fruits these days.

1122
01:30:12,113 --> 01:30:13,714
- Swing it!

1123
01:30:16,083 --> 01:30:17,216
Disgusting.

1124
01:30:19,787 --> 01:30:21,488
- When you gonna pass it?

1125
01:30:22,123 --> 01:30:23,722
- Little Worm... Pass it.

1126
01:30:23,724 --> 01:30:26,160
- Pass it back.
- Little Worm.

1127
01:30:29,630 --> 01:30:31,063
- Bro, pass the blue bag
to the back.

1128
01:30:31,065 --> 01:30:32,631
- Where are we going?

1129
01:30:32,633 --> 01:30:34,802
- Bro, let's go to Denver
and sell all of this.

1130
01:30:36,971 --> 01:30:38,469
- Where is Denver?

1131
01:30:42,076 --> 01:30:43,711

It's pretty quiet.

1143
01:31:56,017 --> 01:31:58,017
- I'm trying to roll.
- I already know.

1144
01:32:04,658 --> 01:32:05,791
- Let me try some.

1145
01:32:05,793 --> 01:32:07,228
- You want some? Alright.

1146
01:32:08,162 --> 01:32:09,964
I ain't giving you that much.

1147
01:32:43,330 --> 01:32:45,030
- Fuck.

1148
01:32:45,032 --> 01:32:47,768
- Oh, bro.
I got something to my arm.

1149
01:32:51,372 --> 01:32:53,305
- Bro, where the fuck
are you going?

1150
01:32:53,307 --> 01:32:54,708
- My fucking head...

1151
01:32:56,077 --> 01:32:57,845
- What's wrong with him?

1152
01:33:00,281 --> 01:33:01,782
- Bro, we gotta go.

1153
01:33:06,020 --> 01:33:08,355
- Man, you're fucking
scaring me.

1154
01:33:10,024 --> 01:33:12,324
Bro, I mean it, bro.
We gotta go.

1155
01:33:12,326 --> 01:33:14,293
- Then fucking leave!
- Let's go. We gotta go.

1156
01:33:14,295 --> 01:33:17,129
Bro, we ain't taking
responsibility for that.

1157
01:33:17,131 --> 01:33:18,332
Let's go.

1158
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:21,068
- Someone grab that blue bag.

1159
01:33:30,911 --> 01:33:32,113
- Oh.

1160
01:33:33,380 --> 01:33:35,114
Thanks, Bill.

1161
01:33:35,116 --> 01:33:38,686
This one's for me, and this
one's for you guys.

1162
01:33:40,087 --> 01:33:41,753
Drive safe, alright?

1163
01:33:41,755 --> 01:33:43,155
- What about that guy?

1164
01:33:43,157 --> 01:33:44,823
- What guy?

1165
01:33:44,825 --> 01:33:47,128
- That guy that you said
would buy that dog?

1166
01:33:47,728 --> 01:33:51,897
- Oh. Well, I know Luis
here doesn't...

1167
01:33:51,899 --> 01:33:54,166
He doesn't want a dog,
because he's allergic to dogs.

1168
01:33:54,168 --> 01:33:56,935
Isn't that right? Yeah.

1169
01:33:56,937 --> 01:33:59,404
Hot Dog, you want a dog?
- What kind of dog is it?

1170
01:33:59,406 --> 01:34:01,974
- It's a poodle.
- Absolutely not.

1171
01:34:03,277 --> 01:34:04,879
- Uh...

1172
01:34:05,446 --> 01:34:08,881
Cynthia, devil woman,
you want a poodle?

1173
01:34:08,883 --> 01:34:10,684
- No.
- No?

1174
01:34:11,385 --> 01:34:13,252
- Omar, do you want a poodle?

1175
01:34:13,254 --> 01:34:15,087
- No, man.
I already got a dog.

1176
01:34:17,124 --> 01:34:18,457
- All right.

1177
01:34:18,459 --> 01:34:21,228
Well... I guess nobody
wants a poodle, Bill.

1178
01:34:23,931 --> 01:34:25,164
- Mm-hmm.

1179
01:34:25,166 --> 01:34:27,735
- Where did that kid
get a poodle?

1180
01:34:34,341 --> 01:34:35,910
- Oh, shit.

1181
01:34:36,477 --> 01:34:38,210
- Yo, what the fuck, bro?

1182
01:34:38,212 --> 01:34:39,813
- What are you guys doing?

1183
01:34:40,214 --> 01:34:41,947
What are you doing
out of the car, son?

1184
01:34:41,949 --> 01:34:43,282
- I needed to go
to the bathroom.

1185
01:34:43,284 --> 01:34:45,352
- Poor guy.
Are you all right?

1186
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:47,855
Shit, I'm sorry.

1187
01:34:49,356 --> 01:34:50,989
Where's my dog?

1188
01:34:50,991 --> 01:34:52,491
Did you see where she went?

1189
01:34:52,493 --> 01:34:53,928
- I can't see shit.

1190
01:34:56,430 --> 01:34:57,996
- Are you okay?

1191
01:34:57,998 --> 01:34:59,765
Aw, don't cry.

1192
01:34:59,767 --> 01:35:01,934
Hold on. Hang on. Hang on.
- What's going on, bud?

1193
01:35:01,936 --> 01:35:03,237
Quit crying.

1194
01:35:08,809 --> 01:35:10,809
- Aw, little guy.

1195
01:35:10,811 --> 01:35:11,877
- Where the fuck is she?

1196
01:35:11,879 --> 01:35:13,212
- Fuck, man.
It's cold as fuck.

1197
01:35:13,214 --> 01:35:14,780
- Can you guys see her?
- No, bro.

1198
01:35:14,782 --> 01:35:16,014
Where the fuck's she at, man?

1199
01:35:16,016 --> 01:35:17,249
- Beast!
- Beast!

1200
01:35:17,251 --> 01:35:18,984
- Beast! Beast!

1201
01:35:18,986 --> 01:35:20,321
- What was that?

1202
01:35:20,788 --> 01:35:23,455
Holy shit. Holy shit.
- Bro, bro, bro, bro, bro!

1203
01:35:29,463 --> 01:35:32,333
- Holy fuck, man.
- Oh, my God.

1204
01:35:39,940 --> 01:35:41,208
- Bill!

1205
01:36:00,995 --> 01:36:02,294
What the fuck happened?

1206
01:36:02,296 --> 01:36:03,929
- Yo, he shot my homie's dog.

1207
01:36:03,931 --> 01:36:05,864
Man, that's some
fucking bullshit.

1208
01:36:05,866 --> 01:36:08,033
- Okay, you need to calm down
right fucking now

1209
01:36:08,035 --> 01:36:09,801
or I'll call the police.

1210
01:36:16,511 --> 01:36:19,213
- You killed my homie's dog
over a fucking turkey!

1211
01:36:19,681 --> 01:36:21,313
- Why are you in my face?

1212
01:36:21,315 --> 01:36:23,048
- Why the fuck are you
in my fucking face?!

1213
01:36:23,050 --> 01:36:25,019
Don't you put your hands on me.

1214
01:36:27,855 --> 01:36:29,290
- Whoa.

1215
01:36:36,930 --> 01:36:38,432
- Go home, Bill.

1216
01:38:29,711 --> 01:38:31,979
- I don't think I could take
care of these...

1217
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:34,348
- Shay.

1218
01:38:42,557 --> 01:38:45,292
- And maybe you
should keep them.

1219
01:38:48,095 --> 01:38:49,997
And I'm really sorry.

1220
01:38:56,203 --> 01:38:59,206
Well, I guess
I'll see you around.

1221
01:43:21,869 --> 01:43:23,470
- What are you doing?

1222
01:43:28,543 --> 01:43:29,911
Are you okay?

1223
01:43:36,584 --> 01:43:38,251
You got a name?

1224
01:43:42,456 --> 01:43:43,524
Are you hungry?

1225
01:43:46,894 --> 01:43:48,863
What do you want, pancakes?

1226
01:43:53,366 --> 01:43:54,902
A sandwich?

1227
01:43:56,303 --> 01:43:58,773
- I want a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.

1228
01:43:59,874 --> 01:44:02,944
- Alright. Well, go sit down.
I'll make it for you.

1229
01:44:46,888 --> 01:44:48,790
Do you like coffee?

1230
01:44:57,064 --> 01:44:59,033
Well, you will
whenever you grow up.

1231
01:45:16,617 --> 01:45:18,418
- Who's calling, please?

1232
01:45:24,959 --> 01:45:26,894
- What's up?
- What's up?

1233
01:45:27,528 --> 01:45:28,529
- Sit down.

1234
01:45:34,434 --> 01:45:36,802
- I was wondering if you could
pay out my wages for me.

1235
01:45:36,804 --> 01:45:39,104
- Uh-huh. Okay. Um...

1236
01:45:39,106 --> 01:45:41,540
Your dog killed
one of the turkeys,

1237
01:45:41,542 --> 01:45:43,609
contaminated my personal pen

1238
01:45:43,611 --> 01:45:46,645
and you punched
my cousin in the face.

1239
01:45:46,647 --> 01:45:48,446
- Yeah, but I worked
them two weeks

1240
01:45:48,448 --> 01:45:49,715
and I didn't get paid for it,

1241
01:45:49,717 --> 01:45:50,983
so I'm just asking
for what you owe.

1242
01:45:50,985 --> 01:45:52,084
- Okay.

1243
01:45:52,086 --> 01:45:54,520
You get me 45 turkeys,

1244
01:45:54,522 --> 01:45:57,089
and then we can talk
about your pay. How's that?

1245
01:45:57,091 --> 01:45:59,558
- She didn't even do shit
to 45 turkeys.

1246
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:01,093
She killed one,
but it was on accident,

1247
01:46:01,095 --> 01:46:02,928
and where the fuck am I gonna
get 45 turkeys from?

1248
01:46:02,930 --> 01:46:04,129
- I don't know.

1249
01:46:04,131 --> 01:46:05,633
You could always
try getting a job.

1250
01:46:06,667 --> 01:46:08,634
Or you could steal them.

1251
01:46:08,636 --> 01:46:10,002
Or you could do
a fucking rain dance.

1252
01:46:10,004 --> 01:46:11,637
- You fucking killed my dog.

1253
01:46:11,639 --> 01:46:14,405
I worked them days,
I chopped your wood,

1254
01:46:14,407 --> 01:46:15,641
I cleaned your fucking closet,

1255
01:46:15,643 --> 01:46:17,643
I took them bitches
everywhere for you.

1256
01:46:17,645 --> 01:46:19,178
- Alright, are you done?
- I don't fucking know.

1257
01:46:19,180 --> 01:46:20,646
Are you gonna pay me?

1258
01:46:20,648 --> 01:46:22,948
- I'm not gonna pay you
because you fucked up.

1259
01:46:22,950 --> 01:46:25,985
So I think that you should
probably go now.

1260
01:46:25,987 --> 01:46:27,620
And we'll leave it at that.

1261
01:48:17,565 --> 01:48:18,899
- Over here.

1262
01:48:25,873 --> 01:48:27,039
- Hey.

1263
01:48:27,041 --> 01:48:28,876
- Ooh, yeah.

1264
01:49:02,810 --> 01:49:04,578
- Let's go! Hurry up!

1265
01:49:48,889 --> 01:49:50,257
- Oh, my God!
