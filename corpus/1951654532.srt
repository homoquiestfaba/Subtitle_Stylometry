1
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:10,195
Now boarding for Bastrop, Smithville...

2
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:14,700
West Point, La Grange, Ellinger, Columbus, Sealy, Brookshire...

3
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:17,578
Katy and Houston.

4
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:20,581
All aboard, please.

5
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:34,970
Man, I just had the weirdest dream back on the bus there.

6
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,181
Do you ever have those dreams that are just completely real?

7
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:40,601
I mean, they're so vivid, it's just like completely real.

8
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,395
It's like there's always something bizarre going on in those.

9
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,397
I have one about every two years or something.

10
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,399
I always remember 'em really good.

11
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:50,485
It's like there's always someone getting run over or something really weird.

12
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:53,864
Uh, one time I had lunch with Tolstoy.

13
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:56,992
Another time I was a roadie for Frank Zappa. Anyway.

14
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,994
So this dream I just had, it was just like that...

15
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,996
except instead of anything bizarre going on...

16
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,373
I mean, there was nothing going on at all.

17
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,960
Man. It was like The Omega Man. There was just nobody around.

18
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:09,296
I was just traveling around...

19
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:13,175
you know, staring out the windows of buses and trains and cars, you know.

20
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,053
When I was at home, I was, like, flipping through the TV stations endlessly,

21
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:16,970
reading.

22
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,765
I mean, how many dreams do you have where you read in a dream?

23
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,561
Wait. Man, there was this book I just read on the bus -

24
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:27,189
You know, it was my dream, so I guess I wrote it or something.

25
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,566
But, uh, man, it was bizarre. It was like, uh...

26
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,693
the premise for this whole book...

27
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:35,697
was that every thought you have creates its own reality, you know?

28
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:38,075
It's like every choice or decision you make...

29
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,077
the thing you choose not to do...

30
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,496
fractions off and becomes its own reality, you know...

31
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,873
and just goes on from there forever.

32
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,875
I mean, it's like...

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,961
uh, you know, in the Wizard of Oz...

34
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:51,338
when Dorothy meets the Scarecrow and they do that little dance at that

35
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,089
crossroads...

36
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,299
and they think about going all those directions...

37
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,385
then they end up going in that one direction.

38
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:59,388
I mean, all those other directions, just because they thought about it...

39
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:01,390
became separate realities.

40
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:04,101
They just went on from there and lived the rest of their life.

41
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,979
I mean, entirely different movies, but we'll never see it...

42
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:10,315
because, you know, we're kind of trapped in this one reality restriction

43
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:11,400
type of thing.

44
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:15,195
Another example would be like back there at the bus station.

45
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:17,990
As I got off the bus, the thought crossed my mind...

46
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:20,367
you know, just for a second, about not taking a cab at all.

47
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:24,371
But, you know, like maybe walking, or bummin' a ride or something like that.

48
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,874
I'm kind of broke right now. I should've done that probably.

49
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:29,376
But, uh, just 'cause that thought crossed my mind...

50
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,461
there now exists at this very second...

51
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:34,590
a whole 'nother reality where I'm at the bus station...

52
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:37,384
and you're probably giving someone else a ride, you know?

53
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,095
I mean, and that reality thinks of itself as this -

54
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:42,598
it thinks of itself as the only reality, you know.

55
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:44,766
I mean, at this very second, I'm in that -

56
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,477
I'm back at the bus station just hangin' out, you know...

57
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,688
probably thumbin' through a paper.

58
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,482
You know, probably goin' up to a pay phone.

59
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,571
Say this beautiful woman just comes up to me, just starts talking to me, you

60
00:03:57,613 --> 00:03:58,739
know?

61
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,366
Uh, she ends up offering me a ride, you know.

62
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,785
We're hitting it off. Go play a little pinball.

63
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:06,663
And we go back to her apartment, I mean, she has this great apartment.

64
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,374
I move in with her, you know.

65
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,293
Say I have a dream some night...

66
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,296
that I'm with some strange woman I've never met...

67
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,798
or I'm living at some place I've never seen before.

68
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:19,593
See, that's just a momentary glimpse into this other reality...

69
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,262
that was all created back there at the bus station.

70
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,389
You know, shoot. And then, you know...

71
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:28,268
I could have a dream from that reality into this one...

72
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:31,063
that, like, this is my dream from that reality.

73
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:34,274
Of course, that's kind of like that dream I just had on the bus, you know.

74
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,401
The whole cycle type of thing.

75
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:40,697
Man, shit. I should've stayed at the bus station.

76
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:40,799
Don't touch her. Need to call the police.

77
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:42,676
Get an ambulance.

78
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,095
Check that bag for some I.D. You better call the family.

79
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:47,389
- Don't touch her! - I've gotta get the bag.

80
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,185
Hurry. I'll stay. Hurry.

81
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,689
What in the hell?

82
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:59,193
- What happened? What's going on? - Accident. Everything's under control.

83
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:01,570
Well, good. So you don't need me?

84
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,198
- No, I don't think so. - Okay.

85
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:07,993
Look, can I help you out? Do you need a ride anywhere or anything?

86
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,703
No, I don't think so.

87
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,498
Tell you what. Take my card. Give me a call.

88
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:15,584
I wish I could stay and help, but I gotta go, really. But call me.

89
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,378
I'd like to hear from you. I mean it.

90
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,677
Whose body is this?

91
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:29,473
- Here, call this guy. - These your groceries, lady?

92
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:02,297
Hello?

93
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:04,591
Uh, yes, it is.

94
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:06,969
This is her son.

95
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:11,890
She's not here right now. I mean, I don't think she's up yet.

96
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:19,064
Oh, drag. Anybody get a licence plate number or anything?

97
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,191
Were there any witnesses?

98
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:24,695
Okay, so the police have been notified.

99
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:30,200
Okay, uh, good. Well, let me know if you need me for anything.

100
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,494
Uh, thanks for calling. Mm-hmm. Okay.

101
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:34,580
Thank you for calling. Thank you.

102
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,897
- Officer Bozzio and Love with the police department. - Hello, it's

103
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:47,606
me.

104
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:13,090
- What happened? - I don't know.

105
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:16,677
Looks like some guy, uh, ran over his mother.

106
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,069
It's so personal

107
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,071
That no one

108
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,991
No one in their right mind

109
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:42,286
Would touch him with a ten-foot pole

110
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,873
With a six-foot pole With a six-inch pole

111
00:11:45,998 --> 00:11:47,875
Well, maybe a six-inch

112
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,669
That's a disturbed young man with a tan

113
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,883
And problems so deep

114
00:11:57,593 --> 00:12:00,304
And so personal torturing himself

115
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,806
With a tan and so personal

116
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,766
Past the Conoco, the Abel's

117
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:06,768
Who's that man with a tan

118
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:09,479
That's a disturbed young man with a tan

119
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:23,869
"Number three: Opportunistic celibacy.

120
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:27,206
"Number four: Renunciation of all human endeavor.

121
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:29,500
"And the fifth and final pillar of euphoria:

122
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,878
"A full-circle, aesthetic reevaluation.

123
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:37,466
"My current response to every worldwide or personal tragedy is:

124
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:39,468
"It's disgusting.

125
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:42,679
I love it. I hope it gets even worse. "

126
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:50,687
Okay. I'm Dostoyevsky. You're Anna. We're writing The Gambler.

127
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:52,689
Take my dictation.

128
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,693
Who's ever written the great work about the immense effort required...

129
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:59,196
in order not to create?

130
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:02,783
Intensity without mastery.

131
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:06,703
The obsessiveness of the utterly passive.

132
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,206
And could it be that in this passivity...

133
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,291
- I shall find my freedom? - Well, I'm headin' over there.

134
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,877
Hey, man. What are you doing? You're supposed to be getting this down. It

135
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:14,711
was pretty good there.

136
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:17,089
- You seen Gary around? - No.

137
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,424
- Does he still live in the same place? - I told you. No one's seen him for

138
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:20,175
months.

139
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,387
- Well, later. - What was that obsessiveness line again?

140
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:26,181
- Obsessiveness without personality? - What are you talking about?

141
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:31,603
Excuse me.

142
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:35,774
Say, pal! Did I overhear you say you got a friend that's missing?

143
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:38,193
Well, I doubt he's missing. He's just not around.

144
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:40,696
Oh, yeah, well. I've been reading in the World Weekly News.

145
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,698
Just a while ago there was a guy out on the street.

146
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:45,868
He's found wandering around, didn't know who he was, where he came from.

147
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:49,496
He's perfectly healthy, but he's a complete amnesiac, you know.

148
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:53,500
A lot of people like that found, uh, just wandering around lately.

149
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:56,295
You know, no history, no nothing.

150
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:58,505
- It's weird, huh? - Yeah.

151
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:02,384
You know about the suppressed transmission, of course?

152
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,178
- Mm-mmm. - No? Oh, well.

153
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:06,180
This is the 20th anniversary of the moon walk, you know.

154
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:09,892
And way back when they're giving us that "One giant step for mankind" bit...

155
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:13,103
another astronaut's in the background yelling his fool head off...

156
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:15,939
saying, "Oh, my God. What's that over in the crater? What the hell is

157
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:16,857
that?"

158
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:18,984
Well, NASA cuts him off just like that.

159
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:22,196
But those of us with the right kind of radios, you know what I mean?

160
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,781
Yeah, we got enough of it. The gist of it was...

161
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:29,203
there's a giant spacecraft over in the other crater, looking at them.

162
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:31,788
That's right. Oh, it all begins to leak out then...

163
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:35,167
that the space program's just one giant big cover-up.

164
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:38,170
It's a covert operation between the United States government and the Soviet

165
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:39,129
Union.

166
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:41,590
It's been going on for over 30 years.

167
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:44,176
We've been on the moon since the '50s.

168
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,595
You wanna know how we got there, right?

169
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:48,305
I'll tell you.

170
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,391
Anti-grav drive. Anti-gravity technology.

171
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:55,479
We stole it from the Nazis after the end of World War II. It's perfectly obvious.

172
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:57,606
And you know, I was watching this Late, Late Show.

173
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:00,067
A lot of truth in the Late, Late Show. You know, they slip it through

174
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,652
there, they figure nobody's watching, but -

175
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:04,404
Anyway, there's this sci-fi movie called Alternative Three.

176
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:07,574
And, uh, it's about kidnapping people, using a little psycho-surgery on

177
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:08,575
them...

178
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,869
and, uh, turn them into zombies.

179
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:14,081
And making them colonize the moon and Mars.

180
00:15:14,206 --> 00:15:16,667
Funny, huh?

181
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:20,170
Except it's absolutely true, all of it.

182
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:23,006
We've been on Mars since '62.

183
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:26,385
It was May 22nd. That's a very important date for you to remember, pal.

184
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:29,972
- Yeah, that's my birthday. - Right. So, see...

185
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:32,808
the reason we're up there covertly is because of the greenhouse effect.

186
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:35,185
It all ties in. Yeah, greenhouse effect.

187
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:36,895
By the way, they discovered that in the '40s.

188
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:39,231
You can ask yourself what they've been doing sitting on their ass for 49 years,

189
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:39,982
huh?

190
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:42,359
While we're out here with some serious social diseases and everything

191
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:43,110
else.

192
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:45,195
Oh, never mind that. Everybody says...

193
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,573
"Greenhouse effect. A hundred years from now.

194
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:50,075
Oh, I'll be long dead, gone and out of here. "

195
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,785
Not so, my friend. Not so.

196
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:54,288
The government's sitting on the fact that it's 10-20 years maximum.

197
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:56,498
It's getting hotter, don't you think?

198
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:58,375
Yeah, it's not even summer yet.

199
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,669
Yeah, and when the polar ice caps begin to melt...

200
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:03,797
it's not gonna take a certified genius to understand that we're in

201
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,798
serious global confusion.

202
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:08,093
I mean, really, we're in massive mainline ecological chaos.

203
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:10,971
Anyway, it's happening even as we speak.

204
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,182
So, I'll tell you what they've already done.

205
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,309
They've colonized outer space.

206
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,394
Oh, they couldn't colonize everybody. No, no.

207
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,479
That would be global bankruptcy.

208
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:21,481
We couldn't beat the greenhouse effect anyway.

209
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:25,277
This secret group, you know, the group that's in charge of the government -

210
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:29,573
Oh, yeah. They're gonna get boosted off this rock before it melts.

211
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:31,575
And the rest of us, what do they care?

212
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,577
We're gonna be left here to fry.

213
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:37,080
By the way, there's something you should know.

214
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:39,208
You see, this entire operation's being funded...

215
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:42,294
by the profits from the Medellín drug cartel.

216
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:44,296
And they're specifically set up by the C.I. A...

217
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:46,673
to handle large sums of money being funneled into this project.

218
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:49,593
Keep it under your hat.

219
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:53,180
The people they need, like scientists. You heard about that?

220
00:16:53,305 --> 00:16:55,557
All the missing scientists around the world, and those that are

221
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:56,308
mysteriously dying...

222
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:58,685
that's all part of the recruiting process.

223
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:02,397
I really hope your friend is not, well -

224
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:04,691
Well, they need a lot of lackeys to do the labor though.

225
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:06,902
So they'll be looking for ordinary guys.

226
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:09,905
You know, just like you and me.

227
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:12,699
Yeah, they need those to kind of colonize things.

228
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:15,786
You know, they do a little psycho-surgery on us, a little liquid lobotomy

229
00:17:15,828 --> 00:17:16,787
here.

230
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,873
Well. And I know this for a fact.

231
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:23,293
They got this drug down in Guatemala in the rain forest.

232
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:25,254
Why do you think the C.I.A.'s down there hacking the hell out of

233
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:25,879
that forest, huh?

234
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:27,881
Make sense? Sure it does.

235
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:30,175
Yeah, this drug takes away your long-term memory...

236
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,804
leaves your short-term memory, so there you are.

237
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:36,390
You got people that don't know who they are, where they came from...

238
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:38,892
but you tell them to do something, and they do it.

239
00:17:40,686 --> 00:17:43,772
They can follow instructions. Perfect employees.

240
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:46,483
- Sounds like most people I know. - So.

241
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:48,485
They must like children too, because...

242
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:50,904
the statistics of the F.B.I. Since 1980...

243
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:54,074
said that 350,000 children are just missing.

244
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:56,285
They disappeared.

245
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:59,079
There are not that many perverts around.

246
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:01,081
You know the worst thing about this, pal?

247
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:03,292
Is that you're in close proximity to all this.

248
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,294
You know, I mean, Houston's right down the road.

249
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:08,088
You know, the main headquarters. NASA.

250
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:10,883
Sure, in the main headquarters, around the world...

251
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:14,469
All right, look. I gotta go see this friend of mine, okay?

252
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:16,680
- Yeah, right in here. - Is this it? Okay.

253
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:19,308
Anyway, look, pal. It's been nice talking to you.

254
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:21,393
I really hope your friend isn't one of them already.

255
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:23,187
- I'm sure he's not. - Yeah, well.

256
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,898
- I just thought you had the right to know. - Thanks.

257
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:28,358
Tell you what, listen. I'm gonna stick around outside, just for a little

258
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,109
while...

259
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:31,403
kind of make sure everything's okay.

260
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:34,281
You know, make sure we weren't followed.

261
00:18:34,406 --> 00:18:36,408
Have a nice day.

262
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:50,380
- Hi, how you doing? - All right.

263
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:52,174
- How's it going? - Fine.

264
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,301
- Matter of fact, where are you going? - Going home.

265
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:56,887
Oh, you live here. Okay, sure. Well.

266
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,181
Just a little security check. There've been some people missing.

267
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:01,808
Nothing to worry about, pal. Okay, you gotta go.

268
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:04,394
I mean, you're in a hurry. That makes perfect sense.

269
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:06,396
Things are speeding up here at the end.

270
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,609
Gotcha.

271
00:19:11,777 --> 00:19:14,404
What a day, what a day.

272
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,368
The thing is, the media's trying to hold up this whole one-party,

273
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:20,327
two-faction system...

274
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:24,706
by telling you that George Bush got this mandate with 54% of the vote.

275
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:27,793
And thatjust doesn't take into account the whole population of the country.

276
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:30,170
They say that 50.3%, in the media...

277
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:34,132
they say 50.3% of the eligible population participated in the '88

278
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:35,384
election.

279
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:38,595
But I think the figure's a hell of a lot lower than that. You gotta consider.

280
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:40,889
Prisoners. We got more people incarcerated in this country...

281
00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:43,308
than any other country in Western history.

282
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:47,771
Noncitizens, the underage, the overage, people too old to get to the polls.

283
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:50,399
People out in rural areas. People who don't have addresses.

284
00:19:50,482 --> 00:19:54,403
I mean, to be conservative, the figure's more like 35%.

285
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:58,282
So Bush got 54% of 35%. What's that, 18%?

286
00:19:58,407 --> 00:20:01,994
Maybe 18% of the people in this country support him.

287
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:04,997
That's nothing. That's nothing. That's not a mandate.

288
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,875
- The people in Nazi Germany had- - You guys done male bonding yet?

289
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,795
Nazi Germany in 1932, the Nazis had maybe 34-38%.

290
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:16,091
And somebody like Pinochet who's already out of there back in Chile...

291
00:20:16,175 --> 00:20:18,594
that guy's got maybe 34-43% of the vote.

292
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:21,597
So 18% is nothing.

293
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,391
Itjust seems like one day it's gonna dawn on everybody...

294
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:27,978
that this large nonvoting majority has been winning every election...

295
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:29,980
for the past three decades.

296
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:32,774
And the people who win these elections are gonna be too ashamed...

297
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,069
or better yet, too afraid to even take power at all.

298
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:40,699
Oh, hey. Ow, man.

299
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:43,577
- Uh, Paul's moved, man. - Where did he go?

300
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:46,497
I don't know. It's like he split, man.

301
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,583
He's like - He disappeared. Nobody knows where he is.

302
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,377
But, uh, his room is, like, totally empty.

303
00:20:52,503 --> 00:20:54,379
It's got everything moved out.

304
00:20:54,505 --> 00:20:56,798
And on the floor there's these postcards just sitting there.

305
00:20:56,882 --> 00:20:59,009
Sitting there right in the middle. It's really bizarre.

306
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:02,596
Why don't you come look? It's really weird.

307
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:09,394
So where you getting all these statistics from anyway?

308
00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:12,397
Dallas Morning News, man. You ought to read it for a change.

309
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:25,077
See, he's gone. All his stuff's gone.

310
00:21:25,202 --> 00:21:27,871
- Strange. - He's a strange guy.

311
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:32,084
- What do we have here? - Those are the cards he left.

312
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:34,086
There's writing on the back of them.

313
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:38,799
They're numbered. It's like a little story or something.

314
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:46,306
"Juan Apagato spends a lot of time wandering around town.

315
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:54,982
"He tried college for a while, but it consumed too much time.

316
00:21:55,107 --> 00:21:57,609
"So now he's looking for a job that doesn't involve much work.

317
00:21:58,694 --> 00:22:01,697
"He rents a room in a large house and rarely sees the people he lives

318
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:02,698
with.

319
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:05,409
"One is called Frank something, and he thinks there are some more...

320
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:07,411
but he can't be sure. "

321
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:09,872
I guess that means all of us.

322
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,502
"He comes from a light blue-collar family.

323
00:22:15,586 --> 00:22:17,796
"He doesn't see his parents much anymore.

324
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,883
"He quit going to visit when they quit sending him money.

325
00:22:21,008 --> 00:22:25,304
One of his grandparents died last month, but he can't remember which. "

326
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:28,891
It's Uncle Fester.

327
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:35,105
"Last summer he thought about sticking his index finger in a fan.

328
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:37,608
"Someone told him his fingerprints are unique, and he believes...

329
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:40,277
"there's too much direct evidence against uniqueness.

330
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:42,654
"He thinks that differences are minor compared to the

331
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:43,405
similarities.

332
00:22:50,996 --> 00:22:53,290
"All his days are about the same.

333
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:55,083
"He wakes up at 11:00 or 12:00...

334
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:57,503
"eats cereal or toast, reads the newspaper...

335
00:22:57,586 --> 00:23:00,088
"looks out the front door, takes a walk...

336
00:23:00,172 --> 00:23:03,008
"goes to a movie matinee, listens to the radio...

337

He likes to sleep. Sometimes he has good dreams. "

340
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:18,398
It's the finale.

344
00:23:28,784 --> 00:23:31,578
Huh. That's interesting.

345
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:36,583
Just a second.

346
00:23:40,212 --> 00:23:43,507
- Hi. - Hey, guy. - Hi.

347
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,509
What's going on?

348
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:47,386
- Paul moved out, man. - Oh, yeah?

349
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:51,181
Yeah, took all his stuff, just left these cards here.

350
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:54,476
- Can I have his room? - Sure, why not?

351
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:56,478
Cool.

352
00:24:02,693 --> 00:24:05,487
Hey, where you headed?

353
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:09,491
Oh, I got some band practice in about five hours...

354
00:24:09,575 --> 00:24:13,787
so I figured I'd mosey on out.

355
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:15,998
- Okay. - See you.

356
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:26,008
Stephanie?

357
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:28,010
- Oh, hi. - Hi. Wow.

358
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:30,179
I haven't seen you around in a long time.

359
00:24:30,304 --> 00:24:32,306
Yeah, I just got back about a week ago.

360
00:24:32,472 --> 00:24:34,975
- Yeah? From where? - Dallas.

361
00:24:35,184 --> 00:24:37,603
Dallas? Man.

362
00:24:37,686 --> 00:24:40,272
What were you doing up there?

363
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:43,275
Hanging out, resting.

364
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:46,904
I was in the hospital for a while.

365
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:50,699
- Wow. - It was really awful.

366
00:24:50,782 --> 00:24:53,202
- Yeah? - Yeah. It was awful.

367
00:24:55,204 --> 00:24:57,873
Your parents, probably?

368
00:24:57,998 --> 00:25:01,502
- Yeah, you could say they put me there. - Yeah.

369
00:25:01,585 --> 00:25:04,087
So what are you up to?

370
00:25:04,213 --> 00:25:08,091
Same old, same old. Just...

371
00:25:08,175 --> 00:25:09,801
lollygagging around.

372
00:25:09,885 --> 00:25:12,012
Still unemployed.

373
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:14,973
Uh, I'm in this band.

374
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:18,810
Well, the one I was in before, but now we've changed our name.

375
00:25:18,894 --> 00:25:20,479
Ta-da

376
00:25:20,604 --> 00:25:22,898
We're The Ultimate Losers now.

377
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:27,194
And, uh, the singer is still a jerk.

378
00:25:27,277 --> 00:25:29,988
And, uh, well.

379
00:25:32,491 --> 00:25:36,411
We're playing this Friday. If you wanna come, I can put you on the list.

380
00:25:39,998 --> 00:25:41,583
I'm sleeping a lot, you know.

381
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:43,877
- Yo, hey, dude. - Hey.

382
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:48,006
Man, I am freaking out so severely. Did you hear what happened on the

383
00:25:48,048 --> 00:25:49,341
freeway?

384
00:25:49,508 --> 00:25:51,385
You didn't see the local news today?

385
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,303
Oh, it's beautiful.

386
00:25:53,387 --> 00:25:56,473
Man, this old man driving to town from San Antonio...

387
00:25:56,598 --> 00:25:59,184
like this old man about 40 or 50 years old...

388
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:01,812
goin' about a hundred miles an hour down the freeway...

389
00:26:01,895 --> 00:26:04,481
waving a gun at people, laughing.

390
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:07,109
Like, doin' fuckin' chicken squawks at people out the window...

391
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:08,777
and showing them his gun and going like -

392
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:12,197
Things like that.

393
00:26:12,281 --> 00:26:14,908
People were freaked. They didn't know if he was just a lunatic, you know...

394
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:16,994
with, like a squirt gun or what.

395
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:20,581
And then, check it out, the guy started firing on the freeway...

396
00:26:20,706 --> 00:26:23,208
randomly through his windows.

397
00:26:23,292 --> 00:26:25,210
He shot one bullet up at the roof of his car...

398
00:26:25,294 --> 00:26:28,297
and it just ricocheted around inside with him for a while.

399
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,800
He was, like, out of his mind. Everybody tried to get off the freeway.

400
00:26:31,884 --> 00:26:35,012
Some chick who had a bullet lodged in her ponytail...

401
00:26:35,095 --> 00:26:37,014
called the pigs in San Marcos.

402
00:26:37,097 --> 00:26:41,101
And they had six or seven pig cars chasing him into the south side of town.

403
00:26:41,185 --> 00:26:44,479
He was still swingin' the gun around, man, and laughing.

404
00:26:44,605 --> 00:26:47,107
He fuckin' laughed all the way.

405
00:26:47,274 --> 00:26:50,903
Finally his car spun out and slammed into the grassy knoll...

406
00:26:50,986 --> 00:26:53,113
you know, the median.

407
00:26:53,197 --> 00:26:55,073
As soon as his car came to a halt, man...

408
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:59,411
he just put the gun to his head and blammo.

409
00:27:01,205 --> 00:27:04,875
Offed himself, man. Blew himself away right there.

410
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,878
It's like, I don't know...

411
00:27:08,003 --> 00:27:11,298
he had had enough, enough.

412
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:13,884
- It's like - - Do you know Stephanie?

413
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:18,305
Oh, yeah. I thought I heard that you were in "Timberlawn. "

414
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:21,892
- I got back about a week ago. - All right, cool.

415
00:27:23,477 --> 00:27:25,395
Oh, yeah. I know what I gotta show you guys.

416
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:27,981
This -This will blow your gourd.

417
00:27:29,274 --> 00:27:32,611
I have this friend, all right, she's a gynecologist in Hollywood.

418
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:36,782
And she scored this for me from the lab where she works.

419
00:27:36,907 --> 00:27:39,993
It's a Madonna pap smear.

420
00:27:40,077 --> 00:27:44,081
I know it's kind of cloudy, but it's a Madonna pap smear.

421
00:27:44,206 --> 00:27:48,377
It's got "Ciccone" on the top. That's like a medical label. "Ciccone. "

422
00:27:49,503 --> 00:27:51,797
Check it out. I know it's kind of disgusting...

423
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,883
but it's like, it's sort of...

424
00:27:55,008 --> 00:28:00,514
like getting down to the real Madonna.

425
00:28:02,474 --> 00:28:05,185
I don't know if you can see it now. I freaked out when it came in the mail.

426
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,813
It had two pubic hairs in it, and I showed it to this asshole...

427
00:28:07,896 --> 00:28:09,815
and he stole one of them.

428
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:13,110
But if you look real close, you can see it's still in there.

429
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:18,282
It's about as black as they come.

430
00:28:21,285 --> 00:28:23,203
Do you think maybe, uh...

431
00:28:23,287 --> 00:28:25,289
you'd be interested in buying something like this?

432
00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:28,083
It's like a high-dollar item.

433
00:28:28,292 --> 00:28:31,378
It's, you know, one of a kind. It's like chance of a lifetime.

434
00:28:31,503 --> 00:28:33,380
Yeah, I'm sure.

435
00:28:33,505 --> 00:28:35,382
I'm pretty broke, though.

436
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:39,595
What about you? Do you think you know anyone who might be -

437
00:28:39,678 --> 00:28:43,807
I mean, it's a little bit getting closer to the rock god herself...

438
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:45,475
than just a poster.

439
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:49,313
No? All right. You guys' loss.

440
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,483
I thought I could, you know, maybe swing a bargain.

441
00:28:53,609 --> 00:28:56,904
- Sorry. - All right. Can't blame me. I tried.

442
00:28:57,112 --> 00:28:59,990
It's a material world and I'm a material girl.

443
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:03,076
I better cruise. I gotta check this guy Chico on the east side.

444
00:29:03,202 --> 00:29:05,204
He's real interested in this.

445
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:07,998
- All right. - Hey, how's your band going anyway?

446
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:10,000
What is it? Beautiful Loser?

447
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:13,295
- Yeah, it's The Ultimate... - All right. Check you later.

448
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:15,297
Losers.

449
00:29:17,508 --> 00:29:21,011
So, yeah, Friday night. Guest list?

450
00:29:21,094 --> 00:29:23,388
Oh, yeah. That might be all right.

451
00:29:23,514 --> 00:29:25,390
Okay.

452
00:29:26,892 --> 00:29:29,186
- Well. - I'll see you Friday.

453
00:29:29,311 --> 00:29:31,313
All right, yeah.

454
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:39,112
Everybody's running around here wondering when the bombs are gonna fall,

455
00:29:39,196 --> 00:29:42,282
and the fact of the matter is that the bombs have already fallen.

456
00:29:42,407 --> 00:29:45,577
People are running around here dwelling in the 11 th-hour concept...

457
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:47,412
and it's well afternoon.

458
00:29:47,496 --> 00:29:50,582
I mean, our thought processes have been totally subverted...

459
00:29:50,707 --> 00:29:53,293
by the concepts these people lay before us.

460
00:29:53,377 --> 00:29:56,505
By the church, the schools and the media right now.

461
00:29:56,588 --> 00:29:58,590
I mean, it's almost impossible to find someone out here...

462
00:29:58,715 --> 00:30:01,885
that can think outside of their own caste system right now.

463
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:04,513
I mean, look at this man across the street in a tie.

464
00:30:04,596 --> 00:30:06,306
This is a ruling-class man...

465
00:30:06,515 --> 00:30:09,393
and he's actually suffering from oxygen deprivation. He's

466
00:30:09,434 --> 00:30:10,352
brain-dead.

467
00:30:10,477 --> 00:30:12,813
Can I sell you a shirt? You know?

468
00:30:12,896 --> 00:30:16,400
And it's like, look at this magazine. Buy this magazine.

469
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:18,610
You might be able to stimulate some thought in yourself...

470
00:30:18,694 --> 00:30:21,405
you know, switch your gestalt so that you might have some perception...

471
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:23,407
and be able to see our way out of this.

472
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:26,910
Alleviate suffering, make us enjoy it or something, you know.

473
00:30:26,994 --> 00:30:30,372
I mean, we're walking around here right now, and it's really time for us to

474
00:30:30,414 --> 00:30:31,498
take action.

475
00:30:31,707 --> 00:30:33,876
All right? We're being taxed out of our asses...

476
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:37,588
to pay for a monopoly on guns by people to oppress us already.

477
00:30:37,713 --> 00:30:40,299
I'm saying if I'm gonna pay taxes on guns and weapons...

478
00:30:40,382 --> 00:30:42,885
that I at least wanna possess them, because I have work for them right

479
00:30:42,926 --> 00:30:43,719
now.

480
00:30:43,886 --> 00:30:47,014
I have some very serious work for them. Something very permanent about death.

481
00:30:47,097 --> 00:30:49,016
- We gotta go. - Remember...

482
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:51,894
terrorism's the surgical strike capability of the oppressed.

483
00:30:51,977 --> 00:30:53,979
- Thanks. - Keep on keepin' on.

484
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:57,316
You everjust want to get the hell out of this country?

485
00:30:57,399 --> 00:31:00,611
- And go where? - I don't know, anywhere.

486
00:31:00,694 --> 00:31:04,490
It doesn't matter. Just some other place.

487
00:31:05,991 --> 00:31:07,910
I don't know.

488
00:31:09,578 --> 00:31:11,705
I've traveled.

489
00:31:11,914 --> 00:31:16,585
And all it is is bad water, bad food, you get sick.

490
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:19,796
You gotta deal with strange people.

491
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:23,300
And when you get back, you can't tell whether it really happened to you...

492
00:31:24,301 --> 00:31:26,178
or you just saw it on TV.

493
00:31:26,303 --> 00:31:29,681
We finally got out of the terrific heat of the Red Sea into the Indian Ocean.

494
00:31:29,806 --> 00:31:32,100
It was just a few degrees cooler.

495
00:31:32,184 --> 00:31:36,188
And then as we got toward Bombay, a wonderful thing happened.

496
00:31:36,313 --> 00:31:38,690
There was a breeze blowing out to sea.

497
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:44,279
And it brought the scent of spices out to us three miles out from shore.

498
00:31:44,404 --> 00:31:47,407
A great wall of incense and spices.

499
00:31:48,408 --> 00:31:52,579
And it was as if we were being wafted into shore on a magic carpet.

500
00:31:54,998 --> 00:31:57,876
The next person who passes us...

501
00:31:58,001 --> 00:32:00,712
will be dead within a fortnight.

502
00:32:25,696 --> 00:32:27,614
- Paper? - No, thank you.

503
00:32:27,698 --> 00:32:29,616
Two-for-one special.

504
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,702
- No. I don't - - Well.

505
00:32:48,802 --> 00:32:51,889
- Hey, have you got change? - You've got a strong back. Get a job.

506
00:32:52,014 --> 00:32:54,808
No, I mean. I have a dollar. I was wondering if I could get change for-

507
00:32:54,892 --> 00:32:57,686
Change. I've got change.

508
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,491
You should quit. Quit.

509
00:33:10,699 --> 00:33:13,911
You should quit. You should quit.

510
00:33:13,994 --> 00:33:16,288
- You should quit. - Howdy.

511
00:33:16,413 --> 00:33:19,583
- What do you need? - Can I have a cup of coffee?

512
00:33:23,086 --> 00:33:27,090
Quit following me. You heard me: Quit following me.

513
00:33:32,012 --> 00:33:34,806
You should never, never, never, never, never traumatizing.

514
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:36,808
You should never- You should never-

515
00:33:36,892 --> 00:33:38,810
You, you, you -

516
00:33:38,894 --> 00:33:41,688
You should - You should -You -

517
00:33:41,813 --> 00:33:46,902
You should never traumatize a woman sexually. I should know.

518
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:49,279
I'm a medical doctor.

519
00:33:49,404 --> 00:33:51,990
You should never traumatize.

520
00:33:52,115 --> 00:33:57,412
You should never name things in order.

521
00:33:57,496 --> 00:33:59,706
You should have to label the order-

522
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:02,501
Hey, cool it down over here.

523
00:34:04,002 --> 00:34:09,508
Ordering. Ordering one, one.

524
00:34:09,591 --> 00:34:14,888
Toothpicks, toothpicks. Toothpick labeling.

525
00:34:15,013 --> 00:34:17,808
- A large coffee to go. - Quit, quit.

526
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:19,810
You should quit. You should quit.

527
00:34:19,893 --> 00:34:22,312
You should- You should-

528
00:34:22,396 --> 00:34:26,608
You should quit traumatizing women with sexual intercourse.

529
00:34:26,692 --> 00:34:29,278
I should know. I'm a medical doctor.

530
00:34:29,403 --> 00:34:32,406
I own a mansion and a yacht.

531
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:34,992
You should quit traumatizing women...

532
00:34:35,117 --> 00:34:37,202
with sexual intercourse.

533
00:34:37,286 --> 00:34:40,789
I should know. I'm a medical doctor.

534
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,004
You should quit. You should quit. You should -

535
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:50,090
You should quit traumatizing women with sexual intercourse.

536
00:34:50,215 --> 00:34:55,888
I should know. You should quit traumatizing women with sexual intercourse.

537
00:34:56,013 --> 00:34:59,016
I should know. I'm a medical doctor.

538
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:01,685
I should know. You should quit.

539
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:04,897
You should never, never know. You never know.

540
00:35:19,495 --> 00:35:21,914
Hey, watch where the hell you're going.!

541
00:35:28,504 --> 00:35:31,298
See, I'm a drifter from Texas.

542
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:34,885
I smoke a lot of pot. Sometimes I trip out to acid.

543
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:38,514
And, uh, wow, it's like the most horrible scene.

544
00:35:38,597 --> 00:35:41,183
Now you tell me how you can live in an apartment...

545
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:47,314
with the pieces of a person rotting away, with decay and not know it.

546
00:35:48,315 --> 00:35:50,317
I was totally sick during that period.

547
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,403
So you didn't kill her, but you did carve her up?

548
00:35:53,487 --> 00:35:55,405
- No. - Who carved her up?

549
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:57,491
There was, like, three people involved in the carving.

550
00:35:57,616 --> 00:35:59,785
So you're denying that you killed her...

551
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:02,996
and you're denying that you took part in carving her up?

552
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,708
- Washing bones. - Why were you washing bones?

553
00:36:06,792 --> 00:36:09,419
- They were smelly. - Then why didn't you tell the police-

554
00:36:09,503 --> 00:36:12,297
God, that is so gross.

555
00:36:14,591 --> 00:36:17,010
Hmm?

556
00:36:17,094 --> 00:36:19,388
I said it's nice outside. We should go do something.

557
00:36:19,513 --> 00:36:22,015
- Like what? - Well, there is a lake in this town.

558
00:36:22,099 --> 00:36:24,893
We could go out there. We could go out to the hills.

559
00:36:25,018 --> 00:36:27,104
We could go to the park and play Frisbee.

560
00:36:27,187 --> 00:36:29,314
I hate shit like that.

561
00:36:29,398 --> 00:36:31,316
All that nature.

562
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,902
And the sunlight's so oppressive now.

563
00:36:35,112 --> 00:36:38,198
And you don't just go to the lake. You have to prepare for it.

564
00:36:38,282 --> 00:36:42,286
You have to get suntan lotion and insecticide.

565
00:36:43,704 --> 00:36:45,706
It's like premeditated fun.

566
00:36:46,999 --> 00:36:49,418
It's too hot outside anyway.

567
00:36:50,794 --> 00:36:53,881
You know, did it ever occur to you that maybe you're what's oppressive?

568
00:36:54,006 --> 00:36:57,885
I mean, "Let's never go out. Let's never venture out of this

569
00:36:57,926 --> 00:36:59,178
one-square-mile area. "

570
00:36:59,386 --> 00:37:01,889
You're just what they want.

571
00:37:02,014 --> 00:37:03,891
Look.

572
00:37:06,101 --> 00:37:08,020
If you're so eager and all fired up...

573
00:37:08,103 --> 00:37:11,398
to get out of the house today, why don't you do that?

574
00:37:11,481 --> 00:37:14,818
Why don't you go to the drugstore and cash a check...

575
00:37:14,902 --> 00:37:19,490
and go to the Kmart and buy a Frisbee.

576
00:37:19,698 --> 00:37:21,909
It takes two people to play Frisbee.

577
00:37:21,992 --> 00:37:23,911
Well, buy a boomerang.

578
00:37:23,994 --> 00:37:26,413
Better yet, I got an idea.

579
00:37:27,414 --> 00:37:29,708
I know something that we could do together...

580
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:32,419
and we wouldn't have to leave the house, and we wouldn't have to buy

581
00:37:32,461 --> 00:37:33,295
anything.

582
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,089
That's the one thing that would be more effective on my own.

583
00:37:36,215 --> 00:37:38,091
- Oh, yeah? - They're back.

584
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,093
Whoa!

585
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:44,890
All right!

586
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:20,509
Come on, guys. We're wasting time.

587
00:38:31,895 --> 00:38:34,398
- Hey, you want a Coke? - Half price.

588
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:36,608
- Diet Coke and Diet Sprite. - Diet Coke.

589
00:38:36,692 --> 00:38:40,112
Hey, come on, man. This shit's getting heavy.

590
00:38:40,195 --> 00:38:42,114
- Come on. - No, bug off. I don't want one.

591
00:38:42,197 --> 00:38:44,116
- Lighten up a little, why don't you? - Fuck off, kid.

592
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:47,995
- Diet Coke? - Man, you guys got...

593
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,414
horrible attitudes.

594
00:38:59,214 --> 00:39:01,717
This is it. Put the typewriter right there.

595
00:39:03,218 --> 00:39:07,389
- So what do we do now? I'm really late. - First of all, give him the tent.

596
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,399
Now recite exactly what I told you to say and throw the tent in.

597
00:39:20,486 --> 00:39:22,404
This was her tent.

598
00:39:25,115 --> 00:39:27,618
- I fucked her in this tent. - A little more feeling.

599
00:39:29,495 --> 00:39:31,580
I fucked her in this tent.

600
00:39:32,706 --> 00:39:35,083
She's probably gonna fuck a lot of other guys.

601
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:37,419
She's off to a good start.

602
00:39:40,214 --> 00:39:42,007
But she's not gonna fuck 'em in this tent.

603
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:44,968
- She's not gonna fuck 'em in this tent. - She's not gonna fuck 'em in this

604
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:45,928
tent.

605
00:39:47,721 --> 00:39:49,598
Throw it in.

606
00:39:55,312 --> 00:39:57,397
Now the typewriter.

607
00:39:57,481 --> 00:39:59,608
- Come on, man. - I don't wanna throw the typewriter in.

608
00:39:59,691 --> 00:40:01,902
You gotta throw the typewriter in. That's why we brought it here.

609
00:40:01,985 --> 00:40:04,321
I been thinking about it. I don't want to throw it in.

610
00:40:04,404 --> 00:40:06,698
- This is juvenile. - Here, you shut up.

611
00:40:06,782 --> 00:40:09,034
When he throws the typewriter in, read the passage that's marked in

612
00:40:09,076 --> 00:40:09,785
the book.

613
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:14,581
Look, man. This is stupid. I'm not gonna throw it in, man.

614
00:40:14,706 --> 00:40:17,501
Why in the hell is he throwing it in? It's a perfectly good typewriter.

615
00:40:17,584 --> 00:40:20,712
The typewriter isn't the point. The point is it symbolizes the bitch that

616
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:21,755
just fucked him over.

617
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,007
It symbolizes the bitch that fucked me over six months ago.

618
00:40:24,091 --> 00:40:26,718
And it symbolizes the bitch that's gonna fuck you over.

619
00:40:26,802 --> 00:40:28,720
Fuck you. I don't wanna read your book.

620
00:40:28,804 --> 00:40:31,014
- Here. You read it. - I'm not gonna read this fuckin' book.

621
00:40:31,098 --> 00:40:33,600
It will make a lot more sense if you read it.

622
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:37,896
- I'm not gonna - - Hey! Goddamn!

623
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:39,982
See how easy that was?

624
00:40:40,107 --> 00:40:43,110
- No problem. Now, just - - Dick.

625
00:40:43,193 --> 00:40:45,821
It all makes sense if you just read this passage here.

626
00:40:45,904 --> 00:40:47,781
What did you do with the bookmark?

627
00:40:47,906 --> 00:40:49,783
I didn't do anything with the bookmark.

628
00:40:49,908 --> 00:40:51,785
- There wasn't one in there. - This is when Leopold discovers...

629
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,787
that he's just been fucked over by his wife.

630
00:40:53,912 --> 00:40:57,583
He says, "If he had smiled, why would he have smiled?

631
00:40:57,708 --> 00:41:01,086
"To reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to

632
00:41:01,128 --> 00:41:02,212
enter?

633
00:41:02,421 --> 00:41:05,716
"Whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series.

634
00:41:05,799 --> 00:41:09,428
"Even if the first term of succeeding ones each imagining himself to be

635
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:10,637
first...

636
00:41:10,804 --> 00:41:12,389
"last, only and alone.

637
00:41:12,514 --> 00:41:16,518
"Whereas he is neither first, nor last, nor only, nor alone...

638
00:41:16,602 --> 00:41:20,189
in a series originating in and repeated to infinity. "

639
00:41:22,816 --> 00:41:24,693
Hey, wait up.

640
00:41:29,281 --> 00:41:32,409
- Hey, how's it going? - Hi. Okay. Where have you been?

641
00:41:32,493 --> 00:41:34,411
- Oh, nowhere. - We've gotta get a move on.

642
00:41:34,495 --> 00:41:36,705
- I got you something. - What?

643
00:41:37,789 --> 00:41:41,502
- Great. NutraSweet, my favorite. - Come on, I got it for half price.

644
00:41:41,585 --> 00:41:44,421
- Budding capitalist youth. - Say, y'all. Y'all got some change.

645
00:41:44,505 --> 00:41:46,381
- Yeah. - Nah.

646
00:41:47,799 --> 00:41:49,718
- There you go. - Thank you.

647
00:41:49,801 --> 00:41:52,095
- You want a soda? - Yeah, I appreciate it.

648
00:41:56,183 --> 00:41:58,519
You know, there's something very wrong with that.

649
00:41:58,602 --> 00:42:02,022
What, that I gave the guy your Coke? The quarter?

650
00:42:02,105 --> 00:42:05,692
Both of them, both of them. It's bad for both of you.

651
00:42:05,818 --> 00:42:08,320
Him because it's not really gonna help him.

652
00:42:08,403 --> 00:42:11,406
And you because that relationship is naturally going to involve...

653
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:14,493
that condescending element, maybe even contempt.

654
00:42:14,618 --> 00:42:17,204
Granted giving the man a quarter isn't gonna change his life around.

655
00:42:17,287 --> 00:42:20,082
I do realize that. There are better ways to help.

656
00:42:20,207 --> 00:42:23,502
- I've been looking into these groups. - That's what I'm talking about.

657
00:42:23,585 --> 00:42:26,713
That's exactly what I'm talking about. See, we're conditioned to assume...

658
00:42:26,797 --> 00:42:28,799
that suffering is bad.

659
00:42:28,882 --> 00:42:31,718
It's not. See, when you pity someone...

660
00:42:31,802 --> 00:42:34,221
all you're able to see is this base creature in them.

661
00:42:34,304 --> 00:42:36,515
You can't see any true potential.

662
00:42:36,598 --> 00:42:38,892
I think it's their potential I do see.

663
00:42:39,017 --> 00:42:43,397
But it's like all these other futile causes that you fall into.

664
00:42:43,522 --> 00:42:45,899
They all stem from a certain weakness.

665
00:42:45,983 --> 00:42:49,820
You know, psychologically, helping everyone else out is easier.

666
00:42:49,987 --> 00:42:52,906
It's an escape from working on yourself, from perfecting yourself.

667
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:54,908
Yeah, Mr. Perfect here.

668
00:42:54,992 --> 00:42:58,203
You know, that's what I hate. When you start talking like this.

669
00:42:58,287 --> 00:43:00,706
It's like you're just pulling these things from the shit you read.

670
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:04,710
You haven't thought it out for yourself, no bearing on the world around us...

671
00:43:04,793 --> 00:43:06,920
and totally unoriginal.

672
00:43:07,921 --> 00:43:12,384
Great. Personal attacks now, is that it? I thought we were beyond that.

673
00:43:12,509 --> 00:43:15,804
It's like you just pasted together these bits and pieces...

674
00:43:15,888 --> 00:43:18,515
from your authoritative sources.

675
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:22,102
I don't know. I'm beginning to suspect maybe there's nothing really in

676
00:43:22,144 --> 00:43:23,270
there.

677
00:43:23,395 --> 00:43:25,606
Suspect, you're beginning to suspect.

678
00:43:25,814 --> 00:43:28,108
Oh, that's rich. That's really rich.

679
00:43:30,194 --> 00:43:34,323
So what? At least what is there is based on good sources.

680
00:43:34,406 --> 00:43:37,034
At least I'm not chained to this slave morality that seems to rule your

681
00:43:37,075 --> 00:43:37,910
life.

682
00:43:37,993 --> 00:43:43,123
Thank you very much. You know, everyone else just thinks you're an asshole.

683
00:43:43,207 --> 00:43:45,083
- Great. - The more I get to know you...

684
00:43:45,209 --> 00:43:47,211
I just feel sorry for you.

685
00:43:47,294 --> 00:43:49,588
- I'm glad they think I'm an asshole. - I bet you are.

686
00:43:49,713 --> 00:43:51,590
I don't think anyone who's ever done anything...

687
00:43:51,715 --> 00:43:54,384
hasn't been considered an asshole by the general populace.

688
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:57,304
- I mean, look at Freud. - Yeah, let's look at Freud. Man.

689
00:43:57,387 --> 00:43:59,890
- I mean, Bob Dylan. - Let's forget it. We're late.

690
00:44:00,015 --> 00:44:02,601
- We've already missed it. - Oh, no. Come on. Come on.

691
00:44:02,684 --> 00:44:05,187
We can make it. There's gonna be five minutes of trailers. It'll be no

692
00:44:05,229 --> 00:44:06,021
problem.

693
00:44:06,104 --> 00:44:08,398
We missed the beginning. Hang it up. I'm gonna go look at some books.

694
00:44:08,524 --> 00:44:11,318
I just need to get away for a little bit. I need some quiet.

695
00:44:11,401 --> 00:44:13,487
How about the next show, two hours from now.

696
00:44:13,612 --> 00:44:15,489
I'll meet you there. You've been wanting to see it.

697
00:44:15,614 --> 00:44:17,407
- Okay. Okay. - Okay?

698
00:44:17,491 --> 00:44:19,409
I'll meet you there. See you.

699
00:44:36,385 --> 00:44:38,387
Oh, I see you're reading Rush toJudgment.

700
00:44:38,512 --> 00:44:41,390
- Oh, yeah. I guess I am. - Oh, that's an excellent book.

701
00:44:41,515 --> 00:44:43,392
- Yeah? - Yeah. Hey.

702
00:44:43,517 --> 00:44:46,311
We had a class a couple of years ago, remember?

703
00:44:46,395 --> 00:44:48,021
No, what class?

704
00:44:48,105 --> 00:44:51,400
It was an anthropology class in ethnographic film.

705
00:44:51,483 --> 00:44:55,487
Oh, yeah, yeah. The dancing birth scenes. Those death rituals.

706
00:44:55,612 --> 00:44:57,489
- Yeah, yeah. - I remember that.

707
00:44:57,614 --> 00:44:59,783
- What have you been up to? - Not too much.

708
00:44:59,908 --> 00:45:02,995
I graduated a couple of years back. Just pretty much hanging out.

709
00:45:05,622 --> 00:45:08,000
- Yourself? - Oh, yeah, you know me.

710
00:45:08,083 --> 00:45:11,086
I've been, uh, keeping up with my J.F.K. Assassination theories,

711
00:45:11,128 --> 00:45:12,087
you know.

712
00:45:12,212 --> 00:45:14,214
- Oh, really? - Yeah.

713
00:45:14,298 --> 00:45:17,092
You know, you're reading one of the great books on the subject.

714
00:45:17,217 --> 00:45:20,721
It's great. Rush toJudgment has all the testimony, you know...

715
00:45:20,804 --> 00:45:23,807
of all the witnesses who were never called before the Warren Commission.

716
00:45:23,891 --> 00:45:25,684
You know, like Mrs. Aquilla Clemmons...

717
00:45:25,809 --> 00:45:29,188
who was that maid who lived on Patton Street who saw the Tippet shooting.

718
00:45:29,313 --> 00:45:33,484
It wasn't Oswald that did it. Of course you know it was Jack Ruby.

719
00:45:33,609 --> 00:45:35,694
- Oh, really? I didn't realize that. - Oh, yes.

720
00:45:35,819 --> 00:45:38,906
This is also the book that's got the testimony of Sam Holland, you know...

721
00:45:38,989 --> 00:45:40,616
the Prince of the Puff of Smoke.

722
00:45:40,824 --> 00:45:43,202
Yeah, he was up there on the overpass over Dealey Plaza...

723
00:45:43,285 --> 00:45:46,121
and he was able to just see everything.

724
00:45:46,205 --> 00:45:48,582
I really don't know too much about this. I was kind of just flipping

725
00:45:48,624 --> 00:45:49,374
through.

726
00:45:49,625 --> 00:45:52,085
Oh, well, it's really good. If you like that...

727
00:45:52,211 --> 00:45:55,088
you should really read one of the other books around here. It might be here.

728
00:45:55,214 --> 00:45:58,383
Best Evidence. That's the one with all the head-snap stuff in it.

729
00:45:58,509 --> 00:46:00,594
- Oh, yeah? - Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

730
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:03,472
Of course, if you like that, you should really read Six Seconds in

731
00:46:03,514 --> 00:46:04,389
Dallas...

732
00:46:04,515 --> 00:46:08,185
'cause, you know, Six Seconds is the one that's got all the trajectories...

733
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:10,812
and the triangulation of the bullets and stuff.

734
00:46:10,896 --> 00:46:13,899
And it's great. It's just got this like second by second account...

735
00:46:14,024 --> 00:46:16,318
of just the entire tragic sequence, you know.

736
00:46:16,401 --> 00:46:18,987
- That's fascinating. Yeah. - Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

737
00:46:19,112 --> 00:46:22,199
But then, of course, then there's my real favorite one right here...

738
00:46:22,324 --> 00:46:24,493
which you really should snap up if you can.

739
00:46:24,618 --> 00:46:26,495
Forgive my Grief. It is great.

740
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:28,789
'Cause, you know, this also has all this testimony in it.

741
00:46:28,914 --> 00:46:31,792
Like, gosh, you know, they talked to Mrs. Erlene Roberts, you know...

742
00:46:31,917 --> 00:46:34,002
who was Oswald's landlady and stuff.

743
00:46:34,086 --> 00:46:37,798
Oh, yeah. And she swears that she saw this, uh, Dallas patrol car...

744
00:46:37,923 --> 00:46:39,925
pull up in front of Oswald's house...

745
00:46:40,008 --> 00:46:43,095
- and give this little "Tit-Tit. " - "Tit-Tit"?

746
00:46:43,303 --> 00:46:46,515
Yeah, yeah. It was the tip-off for Oswald, you know?

747
00:46:46,723 --> 00:46:50,310
Yeah, he was supposed to go up the street up Beckly Avenue -

748
00:46:50,394 --> 00:46:53,522
he was in Oak Cliff- to go to the Steak and Egg Kitchen...

749
00:46:53,605 --> 00:46:55,524
where he was supposed to meet with J.D. Tippet...

750
00:46:55,607 --> 00:46:57,484
and have their "breakfast of infamy. "

751
00:46:57,609 --> 00:47:01,697
Yeah, yeah. You know, the waitresses went on record in the Warren Report...

752
00:47:01,822 --> 00:47:05,075
- saying that Oswald didn't like his eggs and used bad language. -

753
00:47:05,117 --> 00:47:06,160
You're kidding.

754
00:47:06,285 --> 00:47:08,203
- My goodness. - This is good.

755
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:10,789
But, of course, then there's my book, you know.

756
00:47:10,914 --> 00:47:15,586
- You've written one of these books? - Well, I've been working on mine.

757
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:17,921
Yeah. It's gonna be good though.

758
00:47:18,005 --> 00:47:20,090
It's gonna be this totally new approach.

759
00:47:20,215 --> 00:47:23,385
I was just talking with my publisher at this small press.

760
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:26,889
And, I mean, he was telling me that it's gonna be a real winner.

761
00:47:27,097 --> 00:47:31,018
I was thinking of calling it something like Profiles in Cowardice or something.

762
00:47:31,101 --> 00:47:34,104
But he said he didn't think it was too good an idea, you know.

763
00:47:34,188 --> 00:47:36,523
And he really thought that maybe I should, uh...

764
00:47:36,607 --> 00:47:38,692
do something like call it Conspiracy a-Go-Go.

765
00:47:38,817 --> 00:47:40,486
That's catchy. Yeah, I like that.

766
00:47:40,611 --> 00:47:44,114
I've just expanded and expanded upon it, you know. And I went on -

767
00:47:44,198 --> 00:47:47,910
There's this new section about how J.F.K. And Jackie were speed freaks.

768
00:47:47,993 --> 00:47:51,288
And they were just hopped up on amphetamines day in and day out.

769
00:47:51,497 --> 00:47:53,123
- Is that true? - Really, really. Yeah.

770
00:47:53,207 --> 00:47:55,792
At the White House they were visited all the time by this doctor...

771
00:47:55,918 --> 00:47:58,420
that they came to call "Dr. Feel-Good. "

772
00:47:58,504 --> 00:48:00,797
Oh, it's just crazy. It's just crazy.

773
00:48:00,923 --> 00:48:02,799
Well, you know, these all look really good...

774
00:48:02,925 --> 00:48:05,219
but I think I'll just wait for your book to come out.

775
00:48:05,302 --> 00:48:07,888
I'm supposed to be at a movie, so I gotta get a move on.

776
00:48:08,013 --> 00:48:11,225
- But I'll look for your book, okay? - Definitely look for it.

777
00:48:11,308 --> 00:48:14,603
Profiles in Cowardice or Conspiracy a-Go-Go.

778
00:48:35,916 --> 00:48:38,794
- Hey, what's happening? - Hey, not much. How you doing?

779
00:48:38,919 --> 00:48:42,422
Oh, pretty good. I just located this wonderfulJ.F.K. Memorial

780
00:48:42,464 --> 00:48:43,590
booklet.

781
00:48:43,715 --> 00:48:46,301
- His Life, His Words, His Deeds. - Cool.

782
00:48:46,385 --> 00:48:49,096
Yeah, just one more and I'll have the whole set.

783
00:48:49,221 --> 00:48:52,307
- All right. - The last one's theJackie Kennedy issue...

784
00:48:52,391 --> 00:48:55,686
that's got those wonderful articles like "How I Told the Children"...

785
00:48:55,811 --> 00:48:58,605
and "Why the Eternal Flame" and all that stuff.

786
00:48:58,689 --> 00:49:00,315
Uh-huh.

787
00:49:00,524 --> 00:49:03,026
So, what else has been going on?

788
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:07,906
Oh, well, I did find out some really startling information aboutJack Ruby.

789
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:09,908
- Uh-huh? - You know...

790
00:49:09,992 --> 00:49:12,870
I always knew all that stuff how he had been a hit man for the mob in

791
00:49:12,911 --> 00:49:13,829
Chicago...

792
00:49:13,996 --> 00:49:16,415
and in New Orleans and stuff...

793
00:49:16,498 --> 00:49:19,918
and how he was icing people at a pretty young age, but, uh...

794
00:49:20,002 --> 00:49:22,921
you know, I didn't know all that stuff about his dogs.

795
00:49:23,005 --> 00:49:25,215
- Dogs? - Yeah.

796
00:49:25,299 --> 00:49:26,925
He was fascinated with his dogs.

797
00:49:27,009 --> 00:49:31,013
He had this one dachshund named Sheba that he just took with him everywhere.

798
00:49:31,096 --> 00:49:34,391
He treated her like his wife.

799
00:49:35,893 --> 00:49:37,811
That Chevy still poppin' freeze plugs?

800
00:49:37,895 --> 00:49:41,607
Shit. No way. It is blowin' power valves though.

801
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:43,400
- Yeah? - Yeah.

802
00:49:43,525 --> 00:49:46,403
And that was the same dog he took down to the city jail basement...

803
00:49:46,487 --> 00:49:49,698
- when he went to silence Oswald. - Uh-huh.

804
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:51,700
- Hey. - See you guys.

805
00:49:51,825 --> 00:49:54,286
Yeah. Later.

806
00:49:54,411 --> 00:49:56,914
- Here. - Thanks.

807
00:50:01,126 --> 00:50:03,420
Here's those sockets you loaned me.

808
00:50:03,504 --> 00:50:05,589
They're all there.

809
00:50:05,797 --> 00:50:07,925
Thanks. About time.

810
00:50:08,008 --> 00:50:11,011
Yeah, I loaned them to somebody else though.

811
00:50:13,722 --> 00:50:16,600
So you put that 383 bore kit back in here, huh?

812
00:50:16,725 --> 00:50:19,186
Yeah, I got the pop-up pistons.

813
00:50:19,311 --> 00:50:21,688
- Had the block bored over 30. - Yeah.

814
00:50:21,814 --> 00:50:23,816
400 crankshaft.

815
00:50:23,899 --> 00:50:25,818
400 harmonic balancer.

816
00:50:25,901 --> 00:50:28,904
- It's practically a big block now. - You mill the heads?

817
00:50:28,987 --> 00:50:31,490
No, didn't mill the heads.

818
00:50:31,615 --> 00:50:33,617
Stock manifolds though, huh?

819
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:36,495
Yeah, I didn't feel like messin' with the -

820
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:38,914
I didn't feel like messin' with those headers.

821
00:50:44,294 --> 00:50:47,005
Yeah, the tripower linkage never worked out on that Goat.

822
00:50:47,089 --> 00:50:49,091
- Yeah? - Yeah.

823
00:50:49,216 --> 00:50:51,093
- What are you runnin' now? - Quadrajet.

824
00:50:51,218 --> 00:50:54,096
- Uh-huh. That's all right. - G.M.

825
00:50:54,221 --> 00:50:56,098
- Shit, howdy. - Good carburetors.

826
00:50:56,223 --> 00:50:59,518
- Yep. Well, that's pretty clean. - Thanks.

827
00:51:00,894 --> 00:51:04,398
Hey, I gotta get a front left rotor for the Goat. You need anything?

828
00:51:04,523 --> 00:51:06,692
- Yeah, I could get some stuff. - All right.

829
00:51:07,818 --> 00:51:10,612
- I'm going. Free ride. - Okay.

830
00:51:37,389 --> 00:51:40,517
- What did you get? - Distributor.

831
00:51:40,601 --> 00:51:42,895
- H.E.I.? - Yeah.

832
00:51:48,108 --> 00:51:50,027
- You gonna pay for that? - Uh-huh.

833
00:51:52,488 --> 00:51:55,407
Listen, uh...

834
00:51:55,491 --> 00:51:57,826
go over there by those A.M.C.'s.

835
00:51:59,495 --> 00:52:01,997
There's a hole in the fence.

836
00:52:02,122 --> 00:52:04,208
- Okay. - Just go through there.

837
00:52:04,291 --> 00:52:07,127
- All right. - Pick you up on the other side.

838
00:52:26,313 --> 00:52:29,107
- How about a lift back into town? - Yeah.

839
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,319
You better get in back.

840
00:52:58,595 --> 00:53:00,597
That's our last one.

841
00:53:01,598 --> 00:53:03,892
Never mind.

842
00:53:04,017 --> 00:53:06,520
- Where you coming from? - Funeral.

843
00:53:12,609 --> 00:53:16,405
- Sorry. - Fuck it. Should've let him rot.

844
00:53:19,825 --> 00:53:21,827
Who's that?

845
00:53:22,911 --> 00:53:25,414
Stepfather.

846
00:53:29,418 --> 00:53:32,921
- Didn't get along? - Hell, no.

847
00:53:35,007 --> 00:53:37,009
He was a serious fuck-up.

848
00:53:39,219 --> 00:53:42,014
I'm glad the son of a bitch is dead.

849
00:53:42,097 --> 00:53:44,725
I thought he would never die.

850
00:53:45,726 --> 00:53:49,897
He was always getting loaded, beating up my mom...

851
00:53:50,022 --> 00:53:52,316
dragging us kids all over creation.

852
00:53:54,526 --> 00:53:57,112
Nah...

853
00:53:57,196 --> 00:53:59,615
I couldn't wait for the bastard to die.

854
00:54:07,498 --> 00:54:10,918
I'll probably go back next week and dance on his grave.

855
00:54:16,089 --> 00:54:18,008
Just let me out right over here.

856
00:54:58,006 --> 00:55:00,509
Hey, you got a cigarette?

857
00:55:00,592 --> 00:55:04,221
- Hey, you got a cigarette? - Yeah, sure.

858
00:55:10,811 --> 00:55:12,729
Got a light?

859
00:55:20,821 --> 00:55:22,698
Excuse me. Hi.

860
00:55:22,823 --> 00:55:25,909
Do you mind if I ask you a couple questions for a project we're working on?

861
00:55:25,993 --> 00:55:28,495
Sure.

862
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:30,497
Okay?

863
00:55:30,622 --> 00:55:32,708
So, uh.

864
00:55:32,791 --> 00:55:34,793
Did you vote in the most recent election?

865
00:55:34,918 --> 00:55:38,422
Hell, no. I got less important things to do.

866
00:55:39,923 --> 00:55:44,219
- What do you do to earn a living? - You mean work?

867
00:55:44,303 --> 00:55:46,722
To hell with the kind of work you have to do to earn a living.

868
00:55:46,889 --> 00:55:50,517
All it does is fill the bellies of the pigs who exploit us.

869
00:55:51,518 --> 00:55:53,395
Hey.

870
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,689
Look at me. I'm making it.

871
00:55:55,814 --> 00:56:00,027
I may live badly, but at least I don't have to work to do it.

872
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:02,696
What would it take for you to get a job?

873
00:56:02,821 --> 00:56:05,407
Hey, I'll get a job...

874
00:56:05,491 --> 00:56:07,701
when I hear the true call.

875
00:56:07,826 --> 00:56:10,329
What's the true call?

876
00:56:10,412 --> 00:56:13,499
You know, the true call. I know when I hear it.

877
00:56:15,709 --> 00:56:19,296
- Anything else you want to add? - Yeah, there's something else.

878
00:56:19,421 --> 00:56:22,007
To all you workers out there.

879
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:26,720
Every single commodity you produce is a piece of your own death.

880
00:56:26,803 --> 00:56:28,805
What was your relationship like with your parents?

881
00:56:28,889 --> 00:56:30,891
End of interview.

882
00:56:32,392 --> 00:56:34,019
Thanks.

883
00:56:53,205 --> 00:56:55,123
Hey, you got a light?

884
00:56:57,417 --> 00:56:59,419
Hey. Hey, how did you get out?

885
00:56:59,503 --> 00:57:02,130
- Good behavior. - Shit.

886
00:57:05,509 --> 00:57:07,427
- Hey, would you take over? - Okay, I got it.

887
00:57:07,511 --> 00:57:10,305
- Look out for the skinhead with the Mohawk. - I got it.

888
00:57:13,016 --> 00:57:15,102
Ma'am, excuse me.

889
00:57:15,227 --> 00:57:17,104
Uh, I'm with the security in the store.

890
00:57:17,312 --> 00:57:18,814
One of my employees saw you put something in the bag that you haven't paid

891
00:57:18,856 --> 00:57:19,314
for.

892
00:57:19,606 --> 00:57:21,358
- I don't know what you're talking about. - Ma'am, I'm gonna have to ask

893
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:21,942
you...

894
00:57:22,109 --> 00:57:24,486
to step back inside the store back into the office so we can look through the

895
00:57:24,528 --> 00:57:25,279
bag.

896
00:57:25,529 --> 00:57:27,990
Well, I would love to, but I don't have the time.

897
00:57:28,115 --> 00:57:29,992
Ma'am.

898
00:57:30,117 --> 00:57:32,411
Believe me, if you just come back into the office into the store...

899
00:57:32,494 --> 00:57:35,914
it's the best thing for you to do right now to take care of this problem.

900
00:57:35,998 --> 00:57:39,126
There's nothing to take care of. I don't know what you're talking about.

901
00:57:39,209 --> 00:57:43,213
I know her. She was in my ethics class.

902
00:57:43,297 --> 00:57:47,217
I'm always glad to see any young person doing something.

903
00:57:48,218 --> 00:57:52,723
That reminds me of an apprehension I saw in France in the early '40s.

904
00:57:52,806 --> 00:57:54,892
They had finally found some known criminal...

905
00:57:55,017 --> 00:57:57,019
and they were interrogating him.

906
00:57:57,102 --> 00:57:59,021
Something to the effect of...

907
00:57:59,104 --> 00:58:01,815
"It was you who did the job on the rue de Flandue. "

908
00:58:01,899 --> 00:58:03,692
"No, it wasn't me. "

909
00:58:03,817 --> 00:58:05,694
"The concierge recognized you. "

910
00:58:05,819 --> 00:58:07,696
"It's someone who looks like me. "

911
00:58:07,821 --> 00:58:09,823
"She knew your name. "

912
00:58:09,907 --> 00:58:13,827
"It's someone who looks like me and has the same name. "

913
00:58:13,911 --> 00:58:16,830
"She recognized your clothes and hair. "

914
00:58:16,914 --> 00:58:21,126
"He looks like me, has the same name, clothes and hair. "

915
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:24,004
"They found your fingerprints. "

916
00:58:24,213 --> 00:58:27,591
"He looks like me, has the same name, clothes, hair and the same fingerprints.

917
00:58:27,633 --> 00:58:28,717
"

918
00:58:29,009 --> 00:58:32,596
"How long are we going to keep this up?"

919
00:58:32,721 --> 00:58:34,723
"To the very end. "

920
00:58:34,806 --> 00:58:36,600
"It was you who did the job. "

921
00:58:36,725 --> 00:58:39,102
"No, it wasn't me. "

922
00:58:56,495 --> 00:58:58,413
Oh, shit.

923
00:59:00,207 --> 00:59:02,125
Just a sec.

924
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:09,091
If you're here to steal something, you've come to the wrong place.

925
00:59:09,216 --> 00:59:11,301
Nothing much here.

926
00:59:11,426 --> 00:59:14,596
But look around, take whatever you want.

927
00:59:22,813 --> 00:59:25,816
So why don't you let me put that up for you?

928
00:59:25,899 --> 00:59:28,694
It's really not necessary.

929
00:59:28,819 --> 00:59:32,114
No one's going to call the police or anything.

930
00:59:33,198 --> 00:59:35,617
I hate the police more than you, probably.

931
00:59:35,701 --> 00:59:37,619
Never done me any good.

932
00:59:47,504 --> 00:59:50,215
Cup of coffee?

933
00:59:51,508 --> 00:59:53,594
Delia, two cups of coffee, please.

934
00:59:53,719 --> 00:59:55,804
All right, Dad.

935
00:59:57,931 --> 01:00:00,392
So, what do you call yourself?

936
01:00:00,517 --> 01:00:03,103
Paul Yazimsky.

937
01:00:03,228 --> 01:00:05,522
- That Polish? - Uh-huh.

938
01:00:05,606 --> 01:00:08,192
- He was Polish. - Who's that?

939
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,028
One of the true heroes of American history.

940
01:00:11,111 --> 01:00:13,030
Leon Czolgosz.

941
01:00:14,615 --> 01:00:18,118
The man who assassinated William McKinley.

942
01:00:19,495 --> 01:00:23,832
He was an unknown Polish émigré who happened to be an anarchist...

943
01:00:23,916 --> 01:00:27,002
of the "propaganda by the deed" variety.

944
01:00:28,128 --> 01:00:31,215
If there were a hundred like him around today...

945
01:00:31,298 --> 01:00:33,717
you could change the world.

946
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,928
Dad, here you go.

947
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:45,813
The only political assassination of a U.S. President.

948
01:00:47,523 --> 01:00:50,901
Well, except for Lincoln, I guess...

949
01:00:51,026 --> 01:00:54,404
and Kennedy probably, but Leon...

950
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:57,407
was the only anarchist in the bunch.

951
01:00:58,408 --> 01:01:04,331
There was such a thing as belief put into action in those days.

952
01:01:09,294 --> 01:01:11,421
What are you doing this afternoon?

953
01:01:12,631 --> 01:01:16,218
Uh, nothing.

954
01:01:16,426 --> 01:01:18,303
Let's go for a walk.

955
01:01:26,895 --> 01:01:30,399
- Back in a minute, Delia. - Have fun, Dad.

956
01:01:33,694 --> 01:01:36,196
I was there in Catalonia.

957
01:01:36,321 --> 01:01:39,908
Fought with Orwell. Didn't know it then, of course.

958
01:01:39,992 --> 01:01:43,704
Still have my C.N.T. Card. I'll show it to you later.

959
01:01:44,705 --> 01:01:48,709
Those days in Barcelona. My God.

960
01:01:48,792 --> 01:01:51,628
The workers were really in the saddle then...

961
01:01:51,712 --> 01:01:54,298
during the revolution.

962
01:01:54,423 --> 01:01:58,010
Communists killed it long before Franco got there.

963
01:02:01,305 --> 01:02:03,515
Just look at that shit.

964
01:02:04,516 --> 01:02:08,395
I've always dreamed of pulling a Guy Fawkes on the Texas Legislature.

965
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:11,315
Just blow the damn thing sky high.

966
01:02:11,398 --> 01:02:14,318
I've got maps in my room and I'll do it some day.

967
01:02:15,819 --> 01:02:21,033
Texas is so full of these so-called modern-day libertarians...

968
01:02:21,116 --> 01:02:24,495
with all their goddamn selfish individualism.

969
01:02:24,703 --> 01:02:26,997
Just the opposite of real anarchism.

970
01:02:27,122 --> 01:02:30,417
They don't give a damn about improving the world.

971
01:02:30,501 --> 01:02:33,212
But now, Charles Whitman...

972
01:02:34,713 --> 01:02:36,798
there was a man.

973
01:02:36,924 --> 01:02:39,593
Twenty-three years this summer.

974
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:44,097
This town has always had it's share of crazies.

975
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:46,225
I wouldn't want to live anywhere else.

976
01:02:47,309 --> 01:02:49,228
I would have been there too.

977
01:02:49,311 --> 01:02:52,898
I had lunch right out front there every day that summer.

978
01:02:53,023 --> 01:02:56,527
But my fucking wife, God rest her soul...

979
01:02:56,610 --> 01:02:59,530
she had some stupid appointment that day.

980
01:02:59,613 --> 01:03:04,201
So during this town's finest hour, where was I?

981
01:03:04,326 --> 01:03:07,996
Way the hell out on South Congress.

982
01:03:08,121 --> 01:03:11,708
By the time I got there, everything was blocked off.

983
01:03:11,834 --> 01:03:13,710
Shit.

984
01:03:15,796 --> 01:03:18,006
It's taken my entire life...

985
01:03:18,131 --> 01:03:21,635
but I can now say that I've practically given up on not only my own

986
01:03:21,677 --> 01:03:22,803
people...

987
01:03:22,928 --> 01:03:25,722
but for mankind in its entirety.

988
01:03:28,308 --> 01:03:32,229
I can only address myself to singular human beings now.

989
01:03:33,397 --> 01:03:35,899
Hold on a sec. Dad?

990
01:03:36,024 --> 01:03:37,901
- Telephone. It's Lourdes. - Oh, great.

991
01:03:44,408 --> 01:03:46,702
My half-sister.

992
01:03:46,827 --> 01:03:49,204
She might be coming for a visit.

993
01:03:49,329 --> 01:03:53,834
- Where does she live? - Oh, all over.

994
01:03:53,917 --> 01:03:55,794
She travels a lot.

995
01:03:57,504 --> 01:04:00,299
So, he tell you any war stories?

996
01:04:00,424 --> 01:04:04,803
Yeah, I never met anyone that fought in the Spanish civil war before.

997
01:04:05,012 --> 01:04:07,097
Well, you still haven't.

998
01:04:07,222 --> 01:04:09,099
What do you mean?

999
01:04:09,224 --> 01:04:11,101
He tells everybody he fought in the Lincoln Brigade...

1000
01:04:11,226 --> 01:04:14,313
in Barcelona, in Spain.

1001
01:04:14,396 --> 01:04:18,233
Him and my mom went to Spain in, I guess, '55.

1002
01:04:18,317 --> 01:04:20,903
A little late.

1003
01:04:21,028 --> 01:04:23,113
The Lincoln Brigade.

1004
01:04:23,197 --> 01:04:25,115
More like the Hemingway Brigade.

1005
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,327
- I love him though. - Great.

1006
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:31,121
Lourdes will be here end of next week.

1007
01:04:31,205 --> 01:04:33,832
We eat an early dinner if you'd like to stay.

1008
01:04:33,999 --> 01:04:36,126
I gotta go.

1009
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:39,213
Well, come over some other time.

1010
01:04:39,296 --> 01:04:42,925
Yeah, I might. I just might.

1011
01:04:43,008 --> 01:04:45,219
Oh, one more thing.

1012
01:04:46,512 --> 01:04:50,015
The first hurdle for the true warrior.

1013
01:04:51,934 --> 01:04:54,520
"To those humans in whom I have faith.

1014
01:04:54,603 --> 01:05:00,526
"I wish suffering, being forsaken, sickness, maltreatment, humiliation.

1015
01:05:00,609 --> 01:05:05,614
"I wish that they should not remain unfamiliar with profound self-contempt...

1016
01:05:05,823 --> 01:05:10,327
"the torture of self-mistrust, and the misery of the vanquished.

1017
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:12,412
"I have no pity for them...

1018
01:05:12,496 --> 01:05:15,707
"because I wish them the only thing that can prove today...

1019
01:05:15,833 --> 01:05:18,418
"whether one is worth anything or not:

1020
01:05:18,502 --> 01:05:21,213
That one endures. "

1021
01:05:24,007 --> 01:05:26,635
Hey, you forgot something.

1022
01:05:26,718 --> 01:05:31,807
And remember, the passion for destruction is also a creative passion.

1023
01:05:40,107 --> 01:05:42,401
Where the fuck you been, man?

1024
01:05:42,526 --> 01:05:44,403
Doesn't work.

1025
01:05:44,528 --> 01:05:46,905
- What did you get, man? - Man, check it out.

1026
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:51,201
Rare Marquis de Sade, dude. Juliette. Rare Marquis de Sade.

1027
01:05:51,326 --> 01:05:53,912
It's a fuckin' book. Somebody else drive.

1028
01:05:53,996 --> 01:05:55,914
Not me, I'm not drivin'.

1029
01:05:55,998 --> 01:05:58,333
You. You're elected.

1030
01:05:58,417 --> 01:06:02,212
Man, I don't even have my licence. I got warrants out.

1031
01:06:02,296 --> 01:06:04,715
This whole neighborhood and you couldn't get a fuckin' TV?

1032
01:06:04,798 --> 01:06:07,718
Just drop me off at this guy's house.

1033
01:06:07,801 --> 01:06:10,429
The address, man. Take me there. Drop me off.

1034
01:06:25,819 --> 01:06:28,030
- Hey. How's it going? - Hey.

1035
01:06:28,113 --> 01:06:32,409
Oh, better than a sharp stick in the eye, I always say.

1036
01:06:32,534 --> 01:06:35,120
Come on in.

1037
01:06:35,204 --> 01:06:37,498
Did you find me any TVs?

1038
01:06:37,623 --> 01:06:40,501
Oh, well. I looked and stuff.

1039
01:06:40,626 --> 01:06:43,921
But wejust- We don't have that kind of stuff usually.

1040
01:06:44,129 --> 01:06:46,215
I could sure use some.

1041
01:06:46,298 --> 01:06:47,925
Where would you put it?

1042
01:06:48,008 --> 01:06:50,135
Oh, no problem. We rotate the stock.

1043
01:06:50,219 --> 01:06:52,095
Out with the old. In with the new.

1044
01:06:52,221 --> 01:06:54,723
Look, this one here. It's my pride.

1045
01:06:54,807 --> 01:06:57,726
It's been on four years, two months.

1046
01:06:57,810 --> 01:07:00,521
The rest of them, I just kind of keep them going.

1047
01:07:02,397 --> 01:07:06,735
I'm kind of working up a harmonious relationship with them, an equilibrium.

1048
01:07:06,819 --> 01:07:08,904
- Have a seat? - Sure.

1049
01:07:09,029 --> 01:07:12,825
Uh, Pop-Tart? There's red ones. Blue ones over there.

1050
01:07:12,908 --> 01:07:14,910
Oh, no. No, thanks.

1051
01:07:16,829 --> 01:07:18,831
So, uh, what is this...

1052
01:07:18,914 --> 01:07:24,002
some kind of psychic TV-type parallelism?

1053
01:07:24,127 --> 01:07:29,508
Well, we all know the psychic powers of the televised image...

1054
01:07:29,633 --> 01:07:32,928
But we need to capitalize on it...

1055
01:07:33,011 --> 01:07:36,598
and make it work for us instead of us working for it.

1056
01:07:37,933 --> 01:07:42,312
- Like how? - Well, like, to me, my thing is...

1057
01:07:42,396 --> 01:07:46,024
a video image is much more powerful and useful...

1058
01:07:46,108 --> 01:07:49,111
than an actual event.

1059
01:07:49,236 --> 01:07:51,905
Like back when I used to go out, when I was last out...

1060
01:07:52,030 --> 01:07:54,908
I was walking down the street and...

1061
01:07:55,033 --> 01:07:57,411
this guy came barrelling out of a bar...

1062
01:07:57,536 --> 01:08:00,914
fell right in front of me and he had a knife right in his back...

1063
01:08:00,998 --> 01:08:02,916
landed right on the ground.

1064
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,710
And -

1065
01:08:04,835 --> 01:08:07,629
I have no reference to it now. I can't refer back to it.

1066
01:08:07,713 --> 01:08:10,716
I can't press rewind. I can't put it on pause.

1067
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:14,303
I can't put it on slo-mo and see all the little details.

1068
01:08:14,428 --> 01:08:18,015
And the blood, it was all wrong. It didn't look like blood.

1069
01:08:18,098 --> 01:08:20,601
The hue was off and I couldn't adjust the hue.

1070
01:08:20,726 --> 01:08:24,021
I was seeing it for real, but it just wasn't right.

1071
01:08:24,104 --> 01:08:28,901
And I didn't even see the knife impact on the body. I missed that part.

1072
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:32,112
- Too bad. - Yeah.

1073
01:08:32,196 --> 01:08:35,616
Well, I got something to show you. I just got this new tape...

1074
01:08:35,699 --> 01:08:38,535
through some contacts of mine.

1075
01:08:41,205 --> 01:08:43,707
It's by this grad student over in the history department.

1076
01:08:43,832 --> 01:08:47,002
Did you hear about him? He took his whole thesis committee hostage.

1077
01:08:47,127 --> 01:08:50,506
- No. - Yes, it's true. It's unbelievable.

1078
01:08:50,631 --> 01:08:53,800
He took them hostage. The SWAT team came in and offed him.

1079
01:08:53,926 --> 01:08:55,802
- No. - And it's just no one's heard about it.

1080
01:08:55,928 --> 01:08:57,930
It's not getting out.

1081
01:08:58,096 --> 01:09:00,516
Uh, anyway, he made this tape.

1082
01:09:00,599 --> 01:09:04,228
Like, just 15, 20 minutes before he went before the grad committee.

1083
01:09:04,311 --> 01:09:07,105
Because he knew they weren't gonna okay his research.

1084
01:09:07,231 --> 01:09:11,026
It was just way too radical, and way beyond anything they were doing.

1085
01:09:11,109 --> 01:09:13,403
- What was his thesis on? - You know, I don't know.

1086
01:09:13,529 --> 01:09:17,407
I'm really not sure. Something about a bronze age coming in the '90s or

1087
01:09:17,449 --> 01:09:18,700
something.

1088
01:09:18,909 --> 01:09:21,703
I'm just not sure what he was up to.

1089
01:09:28,627 --> 01:09:32,631
Each individual has this absurd notion of this predisposition -

1090
01:09:32,798 --> 01:09:35,717
Hey, looks likeJohn Hinckley.

1091
01:09:35,801 --> 01:09:41,223
He has this-this unending potential, this dormant potential...

1092
01:09:41,306 --> 01:09:46,436
this stupid idea that 95% of the brain is unused...

1093
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:49,022
and that if we could tap into that we would just have...

1094
01:09:49,106 --> 01:09:52,109
we would have Superman or something absurd like that.

1095
01:09:52,234 --> 01:09:54,903
All it does is frustrate man.

1096
01:09:55,028 --> 01:10:00,409
All it does is remind him of his limitations and frustrate him.

1097
01:10:00,534 --> 01:10:03,036
It's just a concoction of lies...

1098
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:06,915
a dynamic that drives man to do things.

1099
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,502
Let me fast-forward to the part where he blows away his camera.

1100
01:10:10,627 --> 01:10:12,504
It's pretty good.

1101
01:10:12,629 --> 01:10:15,632
Every action is a positive action.

1102
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,428
Even if it has a negative result.

1103
01:10:23,432 --> 01:10:27,936
What could be better than a short, uncomplicated life?

1104
01:10:29,021 --> 01:10:31,815
That goes out in a blaze of glory?

1105
01:10:32,816 --> 01:10:34,526
Rock 'n' roll.

1106
01:10:39,907 --> 01:10:41,825
He must've been onto something, man.

1107
01:10:41,909 --> 01:10:44,411
Yeah, he was.

1108
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:47,998
So this is a dub of my copy. You think you'd want a tape of this?

1109
01:10:48,123 --> 01:10:52,002
Yeah, I have some friends in Kansas City. Pirate TV, man.

1110
01:10:53,128 --> 01:10:55,714
If you think you could get this out, I think it really should be shown.

1111
01:10:55,797 --> 01:10:58,717
Oh, yeah, definitely. But, look, I gotta go.

1112
01:11:01,803 --> 01:11:03,722
- Thanks a lot. - All right.

1113
01:11:05,224 --> 01:11:08,310
- Keep looking for those TVs. - Yeah, TVs.

1114
01:11:08,435 --> 01:11:10,229
I'll let you know when we get some.

1115
01:11:10,312 --> 01:11:12,606
Sure. I'll be here.

1116
01:11:19,238 --> 01:11:23,116
Hey, you got "Honor thy error as a hidden intention. "

1117
01:11:25,035 --> 01:11:27,329
Hey, man, uh, you want a card?

1118
01:11:27,412 --> 01:11:29,832
They're, uh, oblique strategies.

1119
01:11:29,915 --> 01:11:33,627
No two cards are alike. Think about whatever you want and take a card.

1120
01:11:33,710 --> 01:11:35,712
Sure.

1121
01:11:35,838 --> 01:11:38,298
Oblique strategies.

1122
01:11:40,717 --> 01:11:43,136
- What one did you get? - It says...

1123
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:46,807
"Withdrawing in disgust is not the same thing as apathy. "

1124
01:11:47,015 --> 01:11:49,434
- Yeah. - What is this?

1125
01:11:50,727 --> 01:11:53,605
Well, that's her menstrual cycle, you know, 28 cups.

1126
01:11:55,315 --> 01:11:57,317
It's got your P.M.S. Section over here.

1127
01:11:57,401 --> 01:11:59,611
And that's taking up a lot of space this month.

1128
01:11:59,736 --> 01:12:01,822
Red ones - Well, you know about the red ones.

1129
01:12:01,905 --> 01:12:05,409
- Pink ones are for water weight days. - Right. The pink ones, water weight.

1130
01:12:06,618 --> 01:12:08,537
Yep, cycles.

1131
01:12:11,498 --> 01:12:13,417
Could I have another one? Is that allowed?

1132
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:15,919
Oh, sure, yeah. You can have as many as you want.

1133
01:12:16,003 --> 01:12:19,506
You can buffer your last thought or think about something new.

1134
01:12:19,715 --> 01:12:21,717
I'm thinking about something new.

1135
01:12:23,802 --> 01:12:26,013
What did you get?

1136
01:12:26,138 --> 01:12:28,515
"It's not building a wall, but making a brick. "

1137
01:12:28,599 --> 01:12:31,018
That's right, man. That's been my day entirely today.

1138
01:12:31,101 --> 01:12:34,438
I can't believe it, man. I told you I was having a breakthrough day today.

1139
01:12:34,521 --> 01:12:38,400
Shooee, howdy, shucks. Okay, well. Yeah, I heard that.

1140
01:12:38,525 --> 01:12:40,402
- No, tell me all about it. - Okay. Well, I mean...

1141
01:12:40,527 --> 01:12:44,031
it's like I've had a total recalibration of my mind, you know.

1142
01:12:44,114 --> 01:12:47,493
I mean, it's like I've been banging my head against this

1143
01:12:47,534 --> 01:12:48,619
19th-Century-type, uh -

1144
01:12:48,702 --> 01:12:51,330
What, thought-mode, construct, human construct?

1145
01:12:51,538 --> 01:12:53,916
Well, the wall doesn't exist. It's not there, you know.

1146
01:12:53,999 --> 01:12:56,126
I mean, they tell you to look for the light at the end of the tunnel.

1147
01:12:56,210 --> 01:12:59,338
Well, there is no tunnel. There is no structure.

1148
01:12:59,421 --> 01:13:02,633
The underlying order is chaos, man.

1149
01:13:02,716 --> 01:13:05,427
I mean, everything's in one big ball of fluctuating matter...

1150
01:13:05,511 --> 01:13:08,222
a constant state of change, you know.

1151
01:13:08,305 --> 01:13:13,101
I mean, it's like across that gray quantum divide is this new consciousness.

1152
01:13:13,227 --> 01:13:16,313
I don't know what that's gonna be like, but I know that we're all part of it.

1153
01:13:16,438 --> 01:13:19,316
I mean, it's new physics. You can't look at something without changing

1154
01:13:19,358 --> 01:13:20,275
it.

1155
01:13:20,526 --> 01:13:22,110
You know, anything.

1156
01:13:22,236 --> 01:13:24,822
I mean, man, that's, like, almost beyond my imagination.

1157
01:13:24,905 --> 01:13:27,825
Geez, it's like that butterfly flapping it's wings in Galveston...

1158
01:13:27,908 --> 01:13:30,202
and somewhere down the road apace it's gonna -

1159
01:13:30,327 --> 01:13:33,121
oh, hey- create a monsoon in China.

1160
01:13:33,205 --> 01:13:35,833
- Hey, can you give me a hand? - Sorry I'm late, you know.

1161
01:13:35,916 --> 01:13:39,002
Oh, that's all right. Time doesn't exist.

1162
01:13:39,127 --> 01:13:42,214
- She's one a day. - Really? One a day for you.

1163
01:13:42,339 --> 01:13:44,925
All right. What did you get?

1164
01:13:45,008 --> 01:13:48,929
"Look closely at the most embarrassing detail and amplify it. "

1165
01:13:49,012 --> 01:13:53,100
- You wanna amplify that? - Whoa! Man, what happened to you?

1166
01:13:53,225 --> 01:13:56,228
Oh, well. I don't really want to go into it at the moment.

1167
01:13:56,311 --> 01:13:59,606
- Uh, you wanna go? Okay. - Yeah.

1168
01:13:59,731 --> 01:14:01,817
Hey, we're gonna ramble on, you guys.

1169
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:04,027
All right, see you.

1170
01:14:04,111 --> 01:14:06,613
- So shooee, howdy, shucks, man. - Who's that guy?

1171
01:14:06,738 --> 01:14:08,615
- What a day, what a day. That guy? - Yeah.

1172
01:14:08,699 --> 01:14:11,326
Oh, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know who he is.

1173
01:14:11,410 --> 01:14:13,704
Just a guy? Yeah.

1174
01:14:13,829 --> 01:14:16,540
- So how's your painting going? - Oh, that one?

1175
01:14:18,625 --> 01:14:21,211
- That same one? - Really, that same one.

1176
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:32,139
Psst.

1177
01:14:33,223 --> 01:14:35,601
- Psst. - Hey, could we get another round?

1178
01:14:35,726 --> 01:14:37,728
Yeah.

1179
01:14:40,230 --> 01:14:42,232
Let me have two, please.

1180
01:14:43,609 --> 01:14:46,111
- Yeah, so what do you guys need? - More coffee, please.

1181
01:14:46,236 --> 01:14:48,906
- Another beer, chips. - Coffee, beer.

1182
01:14:49,031 --> 01:14:51,116
- Great, thanks. - Chips. Hey, may I have another card?

1183
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:53,118
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

1184
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,831
What did you get?

1185
01:14:57,915 --> 01:15:00,834
"Repetition is a form of change. "

1186
01:15:00,918 --> 01:15:03,337
It's all a whole bunch of, like, horrible values.

1187
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:05,506
- More beer? - Yeah, of course.

1188
01:15:05,714 --> 01:15:07,424
Remember, like Saturday morning cartoons?

1189
01:15:07,633 --> 01:15:10,427
It's all a whole bunch of values and junk they're throwing at you.

1190
01:15:10,511 --> 01:15:12,513
Like take Scooby Doo, you know.

1191
01:15:12,638 --> 01:15:15,933
Scooby Doo, he, like, looks at you. It's like -

1192
01:15:16,016 --> 01:15:18,310
Like there's Shaggy and there's Scooby Doo, and they say...

1193
01:15:18,435 --> 01:15:20,604
"Hey, why don't you beat the shit out of this bad guy?

1194
01:15:20,729 --> 01:15:22,439
And, like, we'll give you a Scooby Snack. "

1195
01:15:22,523 --> 01:15:25,400
And he'll go, "Oh, duh. " And they'll say, "Well, two Scooby Snacks. "

1196
01:15:25,526 --> 01:15:27,402
- Yeah, bribery. - Yeah, exactly.

1197
01:15:27,528 --> 01:15:30,531
That's what they're teaching kids. It's like it's all bribery, you know.

1198
01:15:30,614 --> 01:15:33,700
And they're teaching kids fuckin' bribery.

1199
01:15:33,826 --> 01:15:36,703
And then you got the whole other end of the realm where there's like the

1200
01:15:36,745 --> 01:15:37,663
Smurfs...

1201
01:15:37,913 --> 01:15:40,332
and then they've got their little colony group together...

1202
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:42,918
where everybody hangs, you know, in their one little group...

1203
01:15:43,001 --> 01:15:46,338
and everybody's right together, everything flows real well.

1204
01:15:46,421 --> 01:15:49,550
Any time any one of them tries to take off and do their own little

1205
01:15:49,591 --> 01:15:50,592
individual trip...

1206
01:15:50,801 --> 01:15:53,637
that's when Mr. Evil comes down off the hill and stomps on them.

1207
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:59,017
Well, like, Smurfs, you know. It's like a family system, like it's all -

1208
01:15:59,101 --> 01:16:01,937
- Answering to Papa Smurf. - Yeah, it's safety in numbers.

1209
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:05,023
It's like, like the Smurfs are like Mom and Dad.

1210
01:16:05,107 --> 01:16:08,610
And it's like they don't want your kids running off, you know.

1211
01:16:08,735 --> 01:16:11,738
And that's the same thing as Smurfs. They don't want, like, some Smurf...

1212
01:16:11,822 --> 01:16:14,533
leaving the hive colony at all, you know.

1213
01:16:14,616 --> 01:16:16,201
Well, listen, like...

1214
01:16:16,410 --> 01:16:19,037
a friend of mine has this real weird theory about Smurfs.

1215
01:16:19,121 --> 01:16:21,623
But I've been thinking about it, and I think it's kind of cool.

1216
01:16:21,707 --> 01:16:23,625
Actually, I kind of agree with it.

1217
01:16:23,709 --> 01:16:27,504
It's like about Krishna. You know, like Smurfs are blue.

1218
01:16:27,629 --> 01:16:32,009
And he's saying that Smurfs are, like, getting kids used to seeing blue

1219
01:16:32,050 --> 01:16:33,469
people.

1220
01:16:33,635 --> 01:16:36,638
And it's like, you know, with Smurfs being blue...

1221
01:16:36,722 --> 01:16:40,017
kids see blue people, they, like, relate to Smurfs.

1222
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:44,438
And they relate to blue people when Krishna comes about, you know.

1223
01:16:44,521 --> 01:16:48,025
And, I don't know, I kind of agree with that.

1224
01:16:48,108 --> 01:16:50,027
Hey, listen, I'll tell you what.

1225
01:16:50,110 --> 01:16:54,239
I'll buy this round if you, uh, score me a pack of smokes, man.

1226
01:16:54,323 --> 01:16:56,950
All right. But I don't know. Sounds like you're plugging for Scooby Snacks

1227
01:16:56,992 --> 01:16:57,826
to me.

1228
01:16:57,910 --> 01:16:59,828
Yeah, right.

1229
01:17:07,419 --> 01:17:09,922
I heard you had a really great time in Europe.

1230
01:17:10,005 --> 01:17:12,716
- Are you glad to be back? - Yeah, it was incredible.

1231
01:17:12,841 --> 01:17:16,512
I'm real glad to be back though. But at the time I was leaving...

1232
01:17:16,637 --> 01:17:19,223
I really felt the need to get out of this town.

1233
01:17:19,306 --> 01:17:23,435
I'd just ended this two-year relationship with this guy.

1234
01:17:23,602 --> 01:17:27,231
And now that I look back on it, it was really terrible.

1235
01:17:27,314 --> 01:17:30,901
And, like, a boyfriend is the furthest thing from my mind.

1236
01:17:31,026 --> 01:17:32,903
But now that I'm back, things are rolling for me.

1237
01:17:33,028 --> 01:17:35,405
I'm getting a lot of things done.

1238
01:17:35,531 --> 01:17:38,617
I think I can honestly say I'm the happiest I've been in a long time.

1239
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:41,036
- I just feel great. - That's great, yeah.

1240
01:17:41,119 --> 01:17:44,414
A lot of times I leave a relationship and I feel like a whole person again.

1241
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:46,333
And I feel really elated.

1242
01:17:46,416 --> 01:17:50,420
It seems then this ebb and flow thing sets in.

1243
01:17:50,504 --> 01:17:54,424
And I start questioning everything, you know.

1244
01:17:54,633 --> 01:17:58,220
And as long as I'm in a relationship, I swear I cannot be objective.

1245
01:17:58,303 --> 01:18:03,517
It seems like after we've decided that we need one another to be happy...

1246
01:18:03,642 --> 01:18:06,603
then I start getting insecure.

1247
01:18:06,728 --> 01:18:09,439
I'm wondering, worrying all the time.

1248
01:18:09,523 --> 01:18:12,401
It seems like rejection looms, ever-present.

1249
01:18:12,526 --> 01:18:16,738
Rejection. That's one thing I'm not scared of anymore.

1250
01:18:16,822 --> 01:18:19,324
I've conquered the fear of rejection.

1251
01:18:19,408 --> 01:18:21,326
I guess I kind of look at it as a trade-off.

1252
01:18:21,410 --> 01:18:24,705
It's like you reject, you're being rejected constantly.

1253
01:18:24,913 --> 01:18:26,832
So how could you let it bother you?

1254
01:18:26,915 --> 01:18:29,209
No. I don't know if I buy that.

1255
01:18:29,334 --> 01:18:31,920
I don't know that anyone can escape the fear of rejection.

1256
01:18:32,004 --> 01:18:35,924
It's a real primal thing, you know. Can it be escap -

1257
01:18:36,133 --> 01:18:40,137
Perhaps human beings weren't made to be happy and free all the time.

1258
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:42,806
We're always trying to enslave ourselves one way or another.

1259
01:18:42,931 --> 01:18:46,310
If it's not through career, it's through a relationship or it's

1260
01:18:46,351 --> 01:18:47,436
through kids.

1261
01:18:47,603 --> 01:18:50,230
It just doesn't seem to be the natural human state.

1262
01:18:50,314 --> 01:18:54,526
We go through a good phase, then we regress, you know.

1263
01:18:54,610 --> 01:18:56,528
I mean, I'm really glad you're happy.

1264
01:18:56,612 --> 01:18:59,740
Just be prepared. You can always be thrown on the scrap heap.

1265
01:18:59,823 --> 01:19:02,826
- Hey, what's up? How's it going? - Not much. All right.

1266
01:19:02,910 --> 01:19:06,538
- What are you guys up to tonight? - Not much. Just kind of talking.

1267
01:19:06,622 --> 01:19:08,540
Just kind ofhangin'out? You remember...

1268
01:19:08,624 --> 01:19:11,335
I was telling you about my roommate's band earlier?

1269
01:19:11,418 --> 01:19:13,712
Well, he had to borrow my guitar tonight, so...

1270
01:19:13,837 --> 01:19:16,632
I made him put me on the guest list, and I'm on the guest list.

1271
01:19:16,715 --> 01:19:18,509
And I could take some other people with me...

1272
01:19:18,634 --> 01:19:21,512
if some other people might be interested.

1273
01:19:22,805 --> 01:19:24,640
- Hint, hint, you know? - Do y'all wanna go?

1274
01:19:24,723 --> 01:19:27,226
We could maybe have a beer or-

1275
01:19:27,309 --> 01:19:30,437
- Sounds fun to me. - I'm not forcing you or nothing.

1276
01:19:30,521 --> 01:19:32,439
There's no guns involved.

1277
01:19:32,606 --> 01:19:34,316
You know, I'll drive.

1278
01:19:34,525 --> 01:19:37,027
We can go check it out. We could always go to a movie later.

1279
01:19:37,110 --> 01:19:39,029
- Do it, do it. - Okay, yeah.

1280
01:19:39,112 --> 01:19:41,031
- Great. - Cool.

1281
01:19:41,114 --> 01:19:45,327
Well, the problem is that we kind of have to leave now because it's starting.

1282
01:19:45,410 --> 01:19:47,538
- So we gotta like totally roll. - Do you have a car?

1283
01:19:47,621 --> 01:19:49,540
- Do I have a car? I have a van. - Okay.

1284
01:19:49,623 --> 01:19:51,542
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1285
01:20:00,926 --> 01:20:03,303
So, man, have you seen Elvis lately?

1286
01:20:03,428 --> 01:20:05,305
Seen Elvis lately? No.

1287
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:08,684
Check it out, man. I really, honestly believe that this guy is still

1288
01:20:08,725 --> 01:20:09,768
alive.

1289
01:20:09,935 --> 01:20:13,313
And I believe that he's like, you know, living in Las Vegas or something.

1290
01:20:13,438 --> 01:20:16,567
'Cause, you know, if the guy's half-ass cool, you know he's like an Elvis

1291
01:20:16,608 --> 01:20:17,609
impersonator.

1292
01:20:17,818 --> 01:20:21,029
'Cause, I mean, that's kind of like some sort of spiritual hell...

1293
01:20:21,113 --> 01:20:23,907
to parody yourself at the height of your ridiculousness.

1294
01:20:24,032 --> 01:20:25,909
So the guy's gotta get up every day.

1295
01:20:26,034 --> 01:20:28,912
Get as fat as he was and just make fun of himself all day long.

1296
01:20:29,037 --> 01:20:31,540
Isn't that a killer job? Don't you think that's what all old people sort

1297
01:20:31,582 --> 01:20:32,374
of do?

1298
01:20:32,541 --> 01:20:35,127
- Once they get over 28? - Yeah, that's a cool job. Sure.

1299
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:37,129
So how long have you lived here?

1300
01:20:37,212 --> 01:20:41,133
Uh, somewhere in the neighborhood of about six weeks.

1301
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:43,719
- That's it? - Yeah, well, you know.

1302
01:20:43,802 --> 01:20:46,305
- I just skipped out of my old town. Been crashing on couches and shit. - Do you

1303
01:20:46,346 --> 01:20:47,139
like it here?

1304
01:20:47,431 --> 01:20:50,225
- I love it here except for the fuckin' ants. - Ants?

1305
01:20:50,309 --> 01:20:53,437
Yeah, man. All the houses are fuckin' infested with these fuckin' ants.

1306
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,939
- You can't leave anything out. - Not mine.

1307
01:20:56,023 --> 01:20:59,818
Shit. You should come to my house. The other day I went and bought groceries.

1308
01:20:59,943 --> 01:21:02,529
And I'm fuckin' sittin' there. And I walk out of the room, I come back...

1309
01:21:02,613 --> 01:21:05,115
and we got these Cup o' Noodles, and in fuckin' 10 minutes...

1310
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:07,117
the ants have chewed through the Styrofoam cup.

1311
01:21:07,242 --> 01:21:09,328
And they're like all the way in 'em and shit.

1312
01:21:09,411 --> 01:21:12,831
And they ate my crackers. They ate the Ding Dongs, believe it or not.

1313
01:21:12,915 --> 01:21:15,042
The only things left are cans and jars.

1314
01:21:15,209 --> 01:21:17,127
We gotta put the bread and everything in the fridge.

1315
01:21:17,211 --> 01:21:20,130
So everything's all cold and fuckin' chewy and shit all the time.

1316
01:21:20,214 --> 01:21:23,634
- Do you have a girlfriend? - No, 'cause women are from hell.

1317
01:21:23,717 --> 01:21:25,344
- Totally. - I don't think so.

1318
01:21:25,427 --> 01:21:28,138
They're sent here to make men just writhe in pain.

1319
01:21:28,222 --> 01:21:30,307
- No, you're wrong. - It's true.

1320
01:21:30,432 --> 01:21:32,434
Are you making anybody's life hell right now?

1321
01:21:32,518 --> 01:21:36,104
- No, not at all. - Cool.

1322
01:21:36,230 --> 01:21:38,232
- Not at all. - Wanna make somebody's life hell?

1323
01:21:38,315 --> 01:21:40,234
- No. - Okay.

1324
01:21:41,735 --> 01:21:44,321
- Do you know this guy? - No, do you?

1325
01:21:45,823 --> 01:21:47,741
No.

1326
01:21:47,825 --> 01:21:51,328
- I hope she appreciates this. - Yeah, he's a real charmer.

1327
01:21:51,537 --> 01:21:53,831
Really.

1328
01:21:53,914 --> 01:21:56,416
I'm just saying show me a woman that hates her dad...

1329
01:21:56,542 --> 01:21:58,627
and wants to take it out on every man ever born...

1330
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:01,505
and I'll end up with her somehow.

1331
01:22:01,630 --> 01:22:04,925
Well, you picked the wrong night for that.

1332
01:22:05,008 --> 01:22:07,136
Geez, you are no fun, huh?

1333
01:22:07,219 --> 01:22:09,721
This band's gonna be great.

1334
01:22:09,805 --> 01:22:13,183
- This band's gonna be great? I hope so. - Yeah, check it out. You're gonna

1335
01:22:13,225 --> 01:22:14,309
love this.

1336
01:22:14,518 --> 01:22:17,938
- These are friends of yours then? - Friends? Friends is not the word.

1337
01:22:18,021 --> 01:22:20,524
- Brothers of yours? - These are my homeboys.

1338
01:22:32,744 --> 01:22:35,873
I love to drive. Yo, lock it up, because all my really important stuff is

1339
01:22:35,914 --> 01:22:36,915
in here.

1340
01:22:38,917 --> 01:22:42,129
This is my spot. They keep this here for me all the time.

1341
01:22:42,212 --> 01:22:45,716
- Really? - Yeah, check it out. Pretty hip, huh?

1342
01:22:45,841 --> 01:22:49,136
They like me here, you know. 'Cause I'm in, like, tight, you know.

1343
01:22:49,219 --> 01:22:51,138
Tight.

1344
01:22:54,224 --> 01:22:57,519
- What's up, dude? I'm on the guest list. - Three dollars.

1345
01:22:57,644 --> 01:23:00,230
The name's Steve. S-T-E-V-E.

1346
01:23:00,314 --> 01:23:04,109
- Steve plus three or four. - Sorry, Steve. Don't see you.

1347
01:23:04,234 --> 01:23:06,737
Dude, you might wanna check again, 'cause that's my roommate's band.

1348
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:08,822
- I'm supposed to be on the list. - You're not on the list.

1349
01:23:08,906 --> 01:23:12,117
- Is there a problem? - Fuck. I'm not on the list.

1350
01:23:12,242 --> 01:23:14,536
- Figures. - I'm supposed to be.

1351
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:16,830
- You wanna go in? - Okay.

1352
01:23:16,914 --> 01:23:19,416
I feel like hanging out outside.

1353
01:23:19,541 --> 01:23:22,544
- Are you going in? - Yeah.

1354
01:23:22,628 --> 01:23:25,631
- What are you gonna do? - Uh, I don't know.

1355
01:23:25,714 --> 01:23:27,633
I might hang out outside. I might go in.

1356
01:23:27,716 --> 01:23:30,719
Okay, I'm gonna go in, and maybe I'll see you.

1357
01:23:30,844 --> 01:23:32,930
And if not, maybe I'll give you a call or something.

1358
01:23:33,013 --> 01:23:35,808
- All right. I might see you inside. - Have fun inside.

1359
01:23:35,933 --> 01:23:38,227
See you in church.

1360
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:40,604
- What's up, man? - How's life?

1361
01:23:40,729 --> 01:23:44,107
All right. Couldn't get in. Universal sadness all around us.

1362
01:23:44,233 --> 01:23:46,610
- The universe is out of hand. - That sucks.

1363
01:23:46,735 --> 01:23:48,821
- L. Ron Hubbard is gone. - How y'all doing?

1364
01:23:48,904 --> 01:23:50,906
- Hi. - What's going on tonight?

1365
01:23:51,031 --> 01:23:53,116
Oh, my cousin's here. Rachael from Greece.

1366
01:23:53,242 --> 01:23:55,035
- What was your name? - Rachael.

1367
01:23:55,118 --> 01:23:57,037
- That's very pretty. - Thank you.

1368
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,915
Are you enjoying yourself?

1369
01:24:00,123 --> 01:24:02,543
We're gonna go up to the Space. There's a performance.

1370
01:24:02,626 --> 01:24:05,212
Performance? That sounds like fun.

1371
01:24:05,337 --> 01:24:08,340
- You should come check it out. - I'm not sure what we're doing, but -

1372
01:24:08,423 --> 01:24:10,342
- I know what we're doing. - You do?

1373
01:24:10,425 --> 01:24:13,137
- Yeah, you got three bucks? - Okay, we'll see you later.

1374
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:16,223
- Maybe we'll see you there? - Nice to meet you and have a good time.

1375
01:24:16,306 --> 01:24:19,017
Yeah, it was nice meeting you guys.

1376
01:24:19,143 --> 01:24:23,438
Yo, check it out. Liquor store, quarts ofbeer, three bucks. Hey.

1377
01:24:56,013 --> 01:25:00,642
- Hey, what's going on? - Uh, nothing.

1378
01:25:00,726 --> 01:25:04,438
- What's the cover? - Uh, I think it's five bucks.

1379
01:25:04,521 --> 01:25:07,608
But, uh, I got a stamp.

1380
01:25:07,733 --> 01:25:10,736
I think I can, you know, get you in or something.

1381
01:25:10,819 --> 01:25:13,238
See if you lick your wrist or something.

1382
01:25:13,322 --> 01:25:15,824
Great.

1383
01:25:15,908 --> 01:25:17,826
- Perfect. - All right. And Rachael...

1384
01:25:17,910 --> 01:25:19,620
- you need to get a stamp. - What?

1385
01:25:19,745 --> 01:25:22,206
- You need to get a stamp also. - You better have one.

1386
01:25:22,331 --> 01:25:24,541
No, man. I don't want him licking my arm.

1387
01:25:24,625 --> 01:25:27,336
Yeah, but we can get in free. We won't have to pay.

1388
01:25:27,419 --> 01:25:29,338
- Yeah, really. Yeah, it's all right. - Free?

1389
01:25:29,421 --> 01:25:31,840
Here, watch. It's easy. Watch.

1390
01:25:31,924 --> 01:25:33,842
You just do this.

1391
01:25:34,927 --> 01:25:37,221
- Perfect. No problem. - All right.

1392
01:25:37,346 --> 01:25:39,223
- We can get in free. - Thanks.

1393
01:25:39,306 --> 01:25:41,642
Sure. No problem.

1394
01:25:52,236 --> 01:25:54,738
- Five-dollar cover. - I got a stamp.

1395
01:25:56,031 --> 01:25:58,909
- Hey, Kelly. Nice shoes. - Hey, what is that?

1396
01:25:59,034 --> 01:26:02,412
Oh, it's my PixelVision camera. It's for a project I'm putting together.

1397
01:26:02,538 --> 01:26:05,123
Hey, I'll tell you what. Why don't one of you take it?

1398
01:26:05,207 --> 01:26:07,626
Shoot whatever you want.

1399
01:26:07,709 --> 01:26:10,921
Pass it around and we'll see what we come up with later on, okay?

1400
01:26:13,423 --> 01:26:15,509
But I want my camera back, all right?

1401
01:26:28,939 --> 01:26:32,943
That's because they could fuck and think at the same time.

1402
01:26:33,026 --> 01:26:34,945
So history buried 'em.

1403
01:26:35,028 --> 01:26:38,115
It buries every young truth with balls that comes along.

1404
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:40,534
I mean, look at Italo Balbo...

1405
01:26:40,617 --> 01:26:46,331
Christopher Maclaine, Richard Farina, Pierre Landais, Johnny Ace...

1406
01:26:46,415 --> 01:26:48,917
- Let's get the fuck out ofhere. - They never had a chance.

1407
01:26:49,042 --> 01:26:53,046
The reason these guys are being forgotten is they're not Freemasons.

1408
01:26:53,213 --> 01:26:55,132
The Masons are the ones that control history.

1409
01:26:55,215 --> 01:26:57,509
Look, every president but one, a Mason.

1410
01:26:57,634 --> 01:27:01,138
Every man that's walked on the moon, 33rd-degree Mason.

1411
01:27:01,221 --> 01:27:03,474
And look at the Warren Commission, a Shriner convention without

1412
01:27:03,515 --> 01:27:04,224
go-carts.

1413
01:27:04,433 --> 01:27:08,228
Exactly. The slate of American history needs to be wiped clean.

1414
01:27:08,312 --> 01:27:11,023
We need to start all over again.

1415
01:27:11,106 --> 01:27:13,025
Let's put Larry Feynman in the history books.

1416
01:27:13,108 --> 01:27:15,944
Let's put Squeaky Fromme on the one-dollar bill.

1417
01:27:16,028 --> 01:27:19,615
At least we ought to get that Masonic pyramid bullshit off the back.

1418
01:27:19,823 --> 01:27:23,744
- And get some more beer? - Sounds good. Where to?

1419
01:27:23,827 --> 01:27:26,538
Uh, Cue Club? We only got 20 minutes.

1420
01:27:26,622 --> 01:27:28,540
Okay.

1421
01:27:28,624 --> 01:27:32,711
- Are you coming? - Nah, think I'm gonna catch that show.

1422
01:27:32,836 --> 01:27:35,047
Okay, you're either with us or against us.

1423
01:27:35,130 --> 01:27:37,132
Well, I guess I'm against you.

1424
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:39,134
- Let's go. See you later. - All right. Good night.

1425
01:27:39,218 --> 01:27:41,345
See you guys later.

1426
01:27:42,429 --> 01:27:45,641
Man, there ain't no film in that shit.

1427
01:28:03,742 --> 01:28:07,830
I'm getting tired of this mobile home shoved up my ass

1428
01:28:07,913 --> 01:28:11,708
I think something else destroyed your greener grass

1429
01:28:11,834 --> 01:28:16,046
Witness nostalgia seems to be warbling in the throats

1430
01:28:16,129 --> 01:28:21,426
Every time I move it seems I barely miss that damn boat

1431
01:28:21,510 --> 01:28:24,346
Thank you. Good-bye. Thank you.

1432
01:28:33,438 --> 01:28:35,315
Show's over. Let's go.

1433
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:37,234
It's past 2:00. Everybody out.

1434
01:28:37,317 --> 01:28:41,113
Come on, get out. Hit the road. Strike the pavement. Get out of here.

1435
01:28:41,238 --> 01:28:43,532
Time to split. You gotta be somewhere.

1436
01:28:43,615 --> 01:28:47,119
You can't be here. And I wanna go home. Let's go.

1437
01:28:47,244 --> 01:28:49,413
You, passed out, wake up, get out of here!

1438
01:28:49,538 --> 01:28:51,415
Come on, let's go.

1439
01:28:51,540 --> 01:28:53,625
- Hey, what's up, man? - Not much.

1440
01:28:53,709 --> 01:28:56,420
- Whose are these? - They're mine.

1441
01:28:56,545 --> 01:28:58,422
Oh, yeah? Well, where you from?

1442
01:28:58,547 --> 01:29:00,507
- London, England. - Oh.

1443
01:29:00,716 --> 01:29:03,719
Yeah, she's traveling around Texas taking pictures of Dairy Queen.

1444
01:29:03,927 --> 01:29:07,639
Dairy Queens? What the hell you wanna do that for?

1445
01:29:07,723 --> 01:29:10,809
- Dip cones. - Dip cones?

1446
01:29:10,934 --> 01:29:13,937
Nah, I'm kidding. Actually, I'm on my way to New York.

1447
01:29:14,021 --> 01:29:16,607
New York, huh? Are you exhibiting there?

1448
01:29:16,732 --> 01:29:19,026
No, I'm just gonna do some stuff.

1449
01:29:19,109 --> 01:29:24,740
"Do some stuff. " The urban landscape guerrilla graffiti art scene.

1450
01:29:24,823 --> 01:29:28,827
The Soho photographer trudging through the sludge ofTimes Square...

1451
01:29:28,911 --> 01:29:32,539
shooting from the hip and catching the glimpses of all the garbage.

1452
01:29:32,623 --> 01:29:35,000
Working the streets basically. Going to New York just to work the

1453
01:29:35,042 --> 01:29:35,792
streets...

1454
01:29:36,043 --> 01:29:38,045
like everybody else there.

1455
01:29:38,128 --> 01:29:42,007
So, what, do you fancy yourself as some sort of artist, or what?

1456
01:29:42,216 --> 01:29:44,343
No, I'm an anti-artist.

1457
01:29:44,426 --> 01:29:49,515
Oh, one of those neoposeur types that hangs out in coffee shops...

1458
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:51,517
and doesn't do much of anything, yeah.

1459
01:29:51,642 --> 01:29:55,813
No, I feel like being an anti-artist means that...

1460
01:29:55,938 --> 01:29:57,940
I like to destroy other people's artwork.

1461
01:29:58,023 --> 01:29:59,942
Oh, well. In that case.

1462
01:30:00,943 --> 01:30:03,320
No, I'm kidding. I don't do much really.

1463
01:30:03,445 --> 01:30:08,033
I just read and work here and sleep and eat...

1464
01:30:08,116 --> 01:30:10,744
and watch movies.

1465
01:30:10,911 --> 01:30:13,914
Speaking of movies, you being from London...

1466
01:30:14,122 --> 01:30:16,041
and being a photographer and all...

1467
01:30:16,124 --> 01:30:18,627
you might wanna watch Blow Up tonight at 4:00.

1468
01:30:18,710 --> 01:30:20,629
You know Blow Up, you know.

1469
01:30:20,712 --> 01:30:23,549
- London and the '60s. - See you later. - Bye.

1470
01:30:23,632 --> 01:30:27,136
Photographing and mimes playing tennis.

1471
01:30:27,219 --> 01:30:29,221
No, I'm really into photography, not movies.

1472
01:30:29,346 --> 01:30:31,723
But movies are photography, 24 times a second.

1473
01:30:31,849 --> 01:30:33,433
Did I invite you over here to talk to me?

1474
01:32:28,340 --> 01:32:32,427
When young, we mourn for one woman.

1475
01:32:33,512 --> 01:32:37,349
As we grow old, for women in general.

1476
01:32:40,310 --> 01:32:42,229
The tragedy of life...

1477
01:32:42,312 --> 01:32:45,023
is that man is never free...

1478
01:32:45,149 --> 01:32:47,818
yet strives for what can never be.

1479
01:32:51,613 --> 01:32:54,116
The thing most feared in secret...

1480
01:32:54,241 --> 01:32:56,326
always happens.

1481
01:32:56,535 --> 01:33:00,247
My life, my loves, what are they now?

1482
01:33:01,415 --> 01:33:03,917
But the more the pain grows...

1483
01:33:04,042 --> 01:33:09,131
the more this instinct for life somehow asserts itself.

1484
01:33:09,214 --> 01:33:13,218
The necessary beauty in life is in giving yourself to it completely.

1485
01:33:13,343 --> 01:33:16,430
- Wake up, America. - Only later will it clarify itself...

1486
01:33:16,513 --> 01:33:18,932
and become coherent.

1487
01:33:19,141 --> 01:33:21,310
Weapons give away program.

1488
01:33:22,519 --> 01:33:25,147
It's like one of those government programs.

1489
01:33:25,230 --> 01:33:27,816
Just come and fuckin' get anything you want.

1490
01:33:28,025 --> 01:33:31,445
We're gonna give away all the fuckin' automatic weapons.

1491
01:33:31,528 --> 01:33:34,448
All the side-loaders, clip-loaders, shoot-em-backs...

1492
01:33:34,531 --> 01:33:36,450
Saturday night specials...

1493
01:33:36,533 --> 01:33:38,827
Colt. 45s, shotguns.

1494
01:33:38,911 --> 01:33:41,747
Anything you want, chains, knives, straight razors...

1495
01:33:41,830 --> 01:33:45,834
bottles, brick bats, baseball bats...

1496
01:33:45,918 --> 01:33:48,837
and big kind of slanted jagged kind of things.

1497
01:33:48,921 --> 01:33:51,048
I wanna see a goddamn big motherfuckin'...

1498
01:33:51,131 --> 01:33:53,926
shoot 'em up, kill 'em, bang, stab 'em, crush...

1499
01:33:54,009 --> 01:33:58,013
slice, kill, motherfuckin' boilin' oil.

1500
01:33:58,138 --> 01:34:01,433
Catapults throwin' rocks and shit and blowin' up.

1501
01:34:01,642 --> 01:34:03,936
Undercover shit, yeah.

1502
01:34:04,019 --> 01:34:07,523
