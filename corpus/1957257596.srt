1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,733
Gee, Eddie I'm so nervous.

2
00:00:02,766 --> 00:00:04,100
Oh, you'll be just great.

3
00:00:04,133 --> 00:00:05,100
But this is the Palace.

4
00:00:05,133 --> 00:00:07,433
I mean, this is the show
business' Hall of Fame.

5
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:08,500
Oh, they'll love you.

6
00:00:08,533 --> 00:00:11,133
Just imagine Don,
forty million people watching.

7
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:13,566
That's eighty million eyes.

8
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,166
Fifteen seconds, Mr. Knotts.

9
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,300
Fifteen seconds?

10
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:17,700
I'll never make it, Eddie!

11
00:00:17,733 --> 00:00:19,400
You've got to.
They're waiting.

12
00:00:19,433 --> 00:00:20,866
Harvey, how do I look?

13
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,000
Great.
I've dressed you superbly.

14
00:00:23,033 --> 00:00:24,100
Five seconds.

15
00:00:24,133 --> 00:00:25,533
Are you sure I look all right?

16
00:00:26,466 --> 00:00:27,900
Okay, here I go.

17
00:00:28,566 --> 00:00:29,866
Ahh!

18
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,300
What's the matter?

19
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,266
Not again!

20
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,366
Get the pants.

21
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,633
Get the pants!

♪ Don Knotts

31
00:01:21,033 --> 00:01:22,366
Don't go away.

32
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,900
But Mr. Knotts, you're the host.

33
00:01:24,933 --> 00:01:26,566
You're supposed
to open the show.

34
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,866
Yeah I know...

35
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,366
Would you just
excuse me a minute?

36
00:01:32,466 --> 00:01:35,333
What does the host
normally do to open the show?

37
00:01:35,366 --> 00:01:39,166
Oh well, most hosts
usually open with a joke.

38
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,000
Oh well, this is kind
of embarrassing but I
don't know any jokes,

39
00:01:43,033 --> 00:01:45,866
that I could tell here.

40
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,700
Gee, Mr. Knotts for a star
you don't seem very secure.

41
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:51,033
You're not kidding.

42
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:54,466
Grauman's Chinese theater
has my footprints and
silly putty.

43
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,833
That's pretty funny.

44
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:59,733
Hey, why don't you use
that for your opening joke?

45
00:01:59,766 --> 00:02:00,400
What's that?

46
00:02:00,433 --> 00:02:02,533
You know, Grauman's Chinese.

47
00:02:02,566 --> 00:02:04,233
He is?

48
00:02:04,266 --> 00:02:07,600
Oh I, I'm so nervous I don't
even know what I'm saying.

49
00:02:07,633 --> 00:02:08,833
I just...

50
00:02:08,866 --> 00:02:09,833
I'll tell you what's wrong.

51
00:02:09,866 --> 00:02:11,100
I mean, I know you're
all going to leave me

52
00:02:11,133 --> 00:02:13,833
and I'm going to be on the stage
by myself and that scares me.

53
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:16,166
Oh. Well...

54
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,900
Hey, you know,
the Hollywood Palace
Chorale is here.

55
00:02:19,933 --> 00:02:23,033
Maybe I could bring them out

56
00:02:23,066 --> 00:02:24,700
and maybe you could
work with them.

57
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:26,600
Oh, you mean you...they
could sing and maybe I could...

58
00:02:26,633 --> 00:02:27,566
Conduct them!

59
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,600
- Lead them.
- Yeah!

60
00:02:28,633 --> 00:02:29,633
- Is that good?
- Yeah, thank you. Bless you.

61
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:32,033
Okay, would you send
the singers out please?

62
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:42,866
Good evening.

63
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,533
I would like to open the
show by conducting the
Hollywood Palace Chorale

64
00:02:47,566 --> 00:02:52,300
in a song that I have chosen
and the name of the song...

65
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:55,066
- Moonlight Bay.
- Moonlight Bay!

66
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,033

Thank you.

Thank you.

86
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,300
Thank you very much.

87
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,800
Good evening
ladies and gentlemen.

88
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,566
Thank you so much and
welcome to the Hollywood Palace.

89
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,200
You know, I'm awfully glad
to get this chance to return
to the Palace.

90
00:06:03,233 --> 00:06:05,833
I've been so busy
doing feature pictures.

91
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:09,200
My latest picture of course
is "The Love God"

92
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:11,066
and I'll be perfectly
frank with you.

93
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,766
I'm just sick and tired
of being a sex symbol.

94
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:17,933
What do you want?

95
00:06:17,966 --> 00:06:19,633
Flowers for the star.

96
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:25,633
You don't give flowers
during the show, after the show.

97
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:26,833
Who they from?

98
00:06:26,866 --> 00:06:28,233
Me, silly.

99
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,633
Anyway, now ladies
and gentleman,

100
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,500
every adjective in the book
has been used to describe

101
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:44,966
the beauty and the talent
of my first guest

102
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,633
so I'll just use my own
hip expressions.

103
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:51,933
Here's the keen, swell, peachy,
Joey Heatherton.

104
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:49,566
♪ I want to thank you for letting me be myself, again.

105
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:58,066

letting me be myself again.

106
00:08:28,433 --> 00:08:29,933

107
00:08:30,466 --> 00:08:31,733
♪ Oh yeah.

108
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:33,833
♪ Woo-hoo.

109
00:08:36,066 --> 00:08:37,500
♪ Oh...yeah.

110
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,466
♪ Come on boys.

111
00:08:42,866 --> 00:08:48,266

113
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,000

♪ I want to thank you,
for letting me be myself
again, again.

115
00:10:27,633 --> 00:10:31,866
♪ I want to thank you,
for letting me be myself...

116
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,500
That was just marvelous.

117
00:10:47,533 --> 00:10:49,900
You know Joey, you are cute.

118
00:10:49,933 --> 00:10:52,766
Well, you're cute too, Don.

119
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,333
Well, I've always thought so.

120
00:10:56,366 --> 00:11:00,166
It's kind of refreshing to find
someone who agrees with me.

121
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,933
I'm kidding. I really don't
take my beauty that seriously.

122
00:11:03,966 --> 00:11:05,333
Well, you should, Don.

123
00:11:05,366 --> 00:11:08,866
I mean, you may not be a big,
blonde, handsome giant,

124
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,266
but you're beautiful
on the inside.

125
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,033
I wonder where I can go
to turn myself inside out.

126
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:17,133
I wonder if you'd look
the same on the inside?

127
00:11:19,266 --> 00:11:21,566
I think I'll take a look
during the commercial.

128
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:27,100
You know, behind every marriage,
there's a story.

129
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:31,100
Tonight we present a moment
of crisis during the courtship

130
00:11:31,133 --> 00:11:34,166
of Lance Rentzel
and Joey Heatherton.

131
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:41,833
Now listen Joey,
don't worry about a thing.

132
00:11:41,866 --> 00:11:44,466
Everything's going
to be all right.

133
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,633
My father's a real nice guy.

134
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,266
Of course he's very,
very possessive

135
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,100
so I've got to be extremely
careful how I break the news

136
00:11:51,133 --> 00:11:53,033
that we're married.

137
00:11:53,066 --> 00:11:54,966
Well now, you can do
anything you want.

138
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,066
When you come in,
don't let on you're my wife
or even my girlfriend.

139
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,433
I don't know.
Figure out something.

140
00:12:01,466 --> 00:12:02,700
OK?

141
00:12:02,733 --> 00:12:03,833
All right.

142
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,200
Son!

143
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:13,700
Dad!

144
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,233
Oh, look at you boy!
Come here.

145
00:12:15,266 --> 00:12:17,966
- Oh dad, you look good!
- Yeah.

146
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,033
You look good son!

147
00:12:24,066 --> 00:12:26,366
Hey you do too, dad,
but you're kind of purple.

148
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,133
That's because you're
cutting of my wind.

149
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,500
Oh, I'm sorry.

150
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:34,233
- Oh, my son how you've grown.
- It's just great to see you!

151
00:12:34,266 --> 00:12:36,800
You know, you get to be
almost as big as your dad.

152
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,100
Well, it's good eating dad,
good habits, good habits.

153
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,566
Stand next to me.

154
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,900
I got to admit
you're an inch taller.

155
00:12:44,933 --> 00:12:47,200
Let me look at you boy.
Let me look at you.

156
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,200
You know,
you got my nose.

157
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:50,700
You got my eyes.

158
00:12:50,733 --> 00:12:53,000
You got my smile

159
00:12:53,033 --> 00:12:55,566
and you've got
your mother's build.

160
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,133
- Well, let's sit down.
- Yeah.

161
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:01,633
I've been a good father
to you, haven't I, boy?

162
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:02,766
- Oh, you know you have, dad.
- Yeah.

163
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,000
Well, it gets lonely
without you son.

164
00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:09,600
You know, you're all I've had
ever since your mother ran off
with Arthur Treacher.

165
00:13:13,533 --> 00:13:15,500
I guess that's why
I love you so much, son.

166
00:13:15,533 --> 00:13:17,700
I've had to be a mother
to you too.

167
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:20,500
I know dad. That's why I send
you flowers on Mother's Day.

168
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,466
Yes.

169
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,900
You know, it makes me
nervous though when I
think that someday,

170
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:27,866
somehow, someone will,
kinda, come between us.

171
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:32,033
High Lance, old pal!

172
00:13:32,066 --> 00:13:34,700
Who's this?

173
00:13:34,733 --> 00:13:36,233
That's a fraternity
brother of mine.

174
00:13:36,266 --> 00:13:37,866
Oh, I see.

175
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:46,400
He kissed you!

176
00:13:46,433 --> 00:13:48,866
That's one of our
fraternity handshakes.

177
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,600
Well, I think you better
have a meeting and drop it.

178
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,633
Dad, meet our team
quarterback, Joey Jones.

179
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:00,033
Oh well,
pleased to meet you, Joey.

180
00:14:00,066 --> 00:14:02,000
Me too, Mr. Rentzel.

181
00:14:08,433 --> 00:14:11,800
You know, Lance, you've
got some soft quarterback.

182
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,733
I guess he's out of training.
You know.

183
00:14:17,766 --> 00:14:20,700
I told him all about you
and I guess he just got
carried away.

184
00:14:20,733 --> 00:14:22,166
Well, that's all right.

185
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,633
I got kind of a warm
feeling there and I'm not
even in the fraternity.

186
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,300
Sit down, fellah.

187
00:14:32,033 --> 00:14:34,666
Lance has told me
what a great dad he has.

188
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,966
Oh well, thank you.

189
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Have you noticed
he's got my eyes?

190
00:14:38,033 --> 00:14:40,400
Yes.
He must have his mother's build.

191
00:14:40,433 --> 00:14:41,766
Yeah.

192
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,400
She was a biggy.

193
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,900
Hey Lance.

194
00:14:47,933 --> 00:14:49,900
He's holding your hand.

195
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,200
I think he just wants to
keep it warm for passing.

196
00:14:54,233 --> 00:14:55,466
Oh yeah.

197
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,900
Well, I'm sorry but I just have
to think that your quarterback

198
00:14:57,933 --> 00:14:59,633
is a little effeminate.

199
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,433
Dad, no Dallas Cowboy's
are effeminate.

200
00:15:02,466 --> 00:15:04,700
Maybe he's a midnight cowboy.

201
00:15:12,466 --> 00:15:14,900
How'd you fellah's ever
got together anyway?

202
00:15:14,933 --> 00:15:17,033
A blind date.

203
00:15:18,266 --> 00:15:19,833
It was a double date actually.

204
00:15:19,866 --> 00:15:22,266
Oh well, that's
very romantic, yeah.

205
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,433
It was very romantic.

206
00:15:23,466 --> 00:15:25,100
Oh say, I see you're married.

207
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:28,100
Oh yes, that's right, I am.

208
00:15:28,133 --> 00:15:30,033
Well, what's your wife like?

209
00:15:30,066 --> 00:15:35,900
Oh, my wife is blonde
and six foot two.

210
00:15:35,933 --> 00:15:37,333
Six foot two?

211
00:15:37,366 --> 00:15:40,966
- In high heels?
- No, in cleats.

212
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,133
It's a new fashion dad.
Everybody's wearing them.

213
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,566
Sure. Sure.

214
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:49,366
Say Mr. Rentzel,
I suppose you realize that
Lance is very attractive

215
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,933
and one of these days,
a girl is going to take
him away.

216
00:15:52,966 --> 00:15:56,133
Yeah, yeah, that's going to
be thought too, my only son.

217
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,666
You're a good friend, wouldn't
you miss him if he got married.

218
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,200
I sure would.

219
00:16:00,233 --> 00:16:02,933
Us guys have
a lot of fun together.

220
00:16:03,466 --> 00:16:05,666
I bet you do.

221
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,500
Look at it this way dad,

222
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,300
if it meant my happiness,
wouldn't you want to see
me get married?

223
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:13,600
Oh, I suppose if the
right girl came along.

224
00:16:13,633 --> 00:16:17,133
Oh daddy,
I'm so glad you said that.

225
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:24,400
Lance, I want to hear more
about this fraternity!

226
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,266
Dad, I've just got to tell
you something.

227
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,000
You do like Joey, don't you?

228
00:16:30,033 --> 00:16:33,466
I like Joey, of course.
He's a great guy.

229
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,400
Oh well.

230
00:16:36,433 --> 00:16:38,866
Holy smoke!
It's Joe Namath.

231
00:16:46,966 --> 00:16:49,866
It is Joe Namath.

232
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,900
No dad, this is what I've
been trying to tell you.

233
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:55,566
This is Joey Heatherton
and she's now my wife.

234
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,500
Your...Your wife!

235
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:12,400
Dad, dad...how can I say this,

236
00:17:12,433 --> 00:17:14,566
I knew this was
going to be a shock.

237
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,833
You're not angry with me,
are you?

238
00:17:15,866 --> 00:17:17,700
No, but I would've been.

239
00:17:17,733 --> 00:17:20,733
Now I'm just relived
that you married a girl.

240
00:17:32,533 --> 00:17:35,633

Wait a minute, wait a minute.

Thank you, folks.

286
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,133
Hey Don.

287
00:20:38,866 --> 00:20:40,700
Comedians.

288
00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:42,366
You know something Don,

289
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,266
I've been looking forward
to working with you like
this for a long time.

290
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,633
Well, you know something Jimmy,

291
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,100
I've always wanted to,

292
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:52,033
well as they say, share the
spotlight with you too.

293
00:20:52,066 --> 00:20:53,666
You have?

294
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,733
- Why?
- Huh?

295
00:20:55,766 --> 00:20:58,600
The question was, why?

296
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:01,133
Well, that's kind of
a funny thing to ask.

297
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,766
I mean, if you don't mind
my saying so Mr. Durante,

298
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,266
I mean, you're a legend
and it's not exactly
everyday in the week

299
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,866
that I get the chance to meet
a real live legend.

300
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,700
Just the other day
I was thinking of myself,

301
00:21:12,733 --> 00:21:15,700
today, you know, here is
another day and no legend.

302
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:18,533
So today, when I finally
realized, it was my turn--

303
00:21:18,566 --> 00:21:20,800
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

304
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:24,600
Maybe I can help you
un-clarify the situation.

305
00:21:24,633 --> 00:21:27,866
You mean, working with Jimmy has
made all your impossible dreams

306
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,300
and your aspirations
take fruition

307
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:33,666
and the short space of 24 hours?

308
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,533
Well you said it
better than I could.

309
00:21:35,566 --> 00:21:39,400
That's what makes me a legend,

310
00:21:39,433 --> 00:21:42,433
but tell me, exactly, what
gives you the biggest thrill

311
00:21:42,466 --> 00:21:44,933
about this whole experience?

312
00:21:44,966 --> 00:21:46,933
Well, you've done so many
great things, Jimmy.

313
00:21:46,966 --> 00:21:49,300
I mean, they're just
too numerous to mention.

314
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:52,400
I'm willing to let you try.

315
00:21:52,433 --> 00:21:57,066
- Well, first of all there was
- I know what you're going
to say.

316
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,900
My movies,

317
00:21:58,933 --> 00:22:02,033
those unforgettable classics
of the silver screen.

318
00:22:02,066 --> 00:22:03,400
Yeah, that's right.

319
00:22:03,433 --> 00:22:06,400
Like Yankee Doodle Dandy,
The Fighting 69th with
Pat O'Brien--

320
00:22:06,433 --> 00:22:08,166
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

321
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,366
I think you got me confused
with a different Jimmy.

322
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,700
Are you trying to say that
James Cagney's acting style

323
00:22:15,733 --> 00:22:18,866
is so reminiscent of mine,

324
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,633
that makes the public
at some time,

325
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:26,133
a little confused about the
public knowing that I know...

326
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:28,133
Take the next line.

327
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:37,800
You know, you sort of took the
words right out of my mouth.

328
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:42,233
Well, I wasn't too thrilled with
what you were doing with them.

329
00:22:42,266 --> 00:22:46,466
I'm sure you probably are more
impressed with my songs

330
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,300
than my thespian abilities.

331
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:50,733
Well, that's true.

332
00:22:50,766 --> 00:22:54,600
I guess after all, who could
forget that great song like

333
00:22:54,633 --> 00:22:59,966
Inca Banca Boca...
Inca Banca Buca,

334
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,666
Well, I can't remember
the whole melody but...

335
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,700
Well, I want to thank you
for taking this legend

336
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:09,333
and making him an unknown.

337
00:23:09,366 --> 00:23:14,966
I wish I have the ability to
express myself in the clear and
the smooth and the lucid way

338
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,366
that you have of doing it,
Jimmy.

339
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,866
It's easy, Don.

340
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,666
I just open my mouth
and hope for the best.

341
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:25,333
Of course, it's much easier when
you have something nice to say.

342
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:32,400
It's time to play the game
that helps you meet your mate.

343
00:23:32,433 --> 00:23:34,200
Passion Impossible

344
00:23:34,233 --> 00:23:37,633
and here's your host,
Sonny Smiles.

345
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,033
Oh, hi!

346
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,366
Hi there!

347
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,833
How are you doing, folks?

348
00:23:44,866 --> 00:23:48,233
We're just warming up our
contestant Ms. Abigail Finchley.

349
00:23:48,266 --> 00:23:50,400
She warms up very well.
Abigail...

350
00:23:50,433 --> 00:23:51,833
Oh, Sonny.

351
00:23:51,866 --> 00:23:53,000
Oh, You.

352
00:23:53,033 --> 00:23:55,733
All right.
Easy, easy does it.

353
00:23:55,766 --> 00:23:58,966
Abigail, do you want to
tell the audience a little
bit about yourself now?

354
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,500
Well, Sonny.

355
00:24:00,533 --> 00:24:03,366
First of all I'm a kindergarten
teacher from Eastern View.

356
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,233
Eastern View let's hear it
for Eastern View, please.

357
00:24:05,266 --> 00:24:09,233
It we could, if we could,
great town Eastern View.

358
00:24:09,266 --> 00:24:11,566
And I was never kissed
until I was twenty three.

359
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,800
Never kissed until
you were twenty three

360
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:14,033
and then, and then you've...

361
00:24:14,066 --> 00:24:16,400
And then, Geronimo!

362
00:24:18,633 --> 00:24:22,533
Oh yeah, a little bundle
of fun there, aren't we.

363
00:24:22,566 --> 00:24:25,600
Now are you ready to play
Passion Impossible?

364
00:24:25,633 --> 00:24:28,600
Oh, are you kidding?

365
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,966
Now, I wanna point out
that our two bachelors

366
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,666
who are gonna be vying
for your hand tonight

367
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,033
have never met and they
still cannot see each other.

368
00:24:35,066 --> 00:24:38,733
Now, let's meet them right now;
bachelors of the night.

369
00:24:38,766 --> 00:24:42,900
Our first bachelor one of the
world's richest playboys;

370
00:24:42,933 --> 00:24:45,566
he actually owns a
hundred thirty five oil wells,

371
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,433
a fleet of ships, an airline,
three countries

372
00:24:48,466 --> 00:24:51,333
and right now he's
dickering to buy a pair
of bell bottom pants.

373
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:54,266
I like you to meet
Mr. James D. Wealth.

374
00:24:55,366 --> 00:24:58,033
Thank you.
Thank you.

375
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:03,500
Our second bachelor is
a former Vice President
of the United States,

376
00:25:03,533 --> 00:25:06,200
a part time cheer leader
for the New York Jets,

377
00:25:06,233 --> 00:25:07,800
and a big game hunter

378
00:25:07,833 --> 00:25:10,133
who just returned from
a hunting expedition
where he killed

379
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:12,233
twelve lions in the Boston Zoo,

380
00:25:12,266 --> 00:25:15,033
Mr. Donald K. Dangerfield.

381
00:25:21,766 --> 00:25:27,733
I left my jaguar in the
parking lot I hope it
doesn't eat the attendant.

382
00:25:27,766 --> 00:25:29,866
But that's, that's the break
of the passion game.

383
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,233
Now, on with the show.

384
00:25:31,266 --> 00:25:35,100
Well, Abigail now Abigail
you did not hear a think
I said, right?

385
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:40,200
All right dear, let's play,
let's play dear let's, let's...

386
00:25:40,233 --> 00:25:41,666
Oh, let's play...

387
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:47,033
Let's play Passion Impossible.

388
00:25:47,066 --> 00:25:50,700
Well okay,
Bachelor number one now,

389
00:25:50,733 --> 00:25:52,933
what would you do if
we were going steady

390
00:25:52,966 --> 00:25:56,400
and my father forbade me
to ever see you again?

391
00:25:56,433 --> 00:26:00,566
Well, I'd tell him
it's not nice to forbid.

392
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,433
Oh.

393
00:26:02,466 --> 00:26:05,300
Especially in mixed company.

394
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:08,066
Oh, I think I'm in love
with number one.

395
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,000
Oh, but I'll give
number two another chance.

396
00:26:10,033 --> 00:26:14,666
Okay, what if I were captured
by a band of wild savages

397
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,933
and you heard me scream
for help after the third day,

398
00:26:17,966 --> 00:26:20,766
how would you rescue me?

399
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,366
Well, that's easy.

400
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,533
First, I jump into my
private airplane, fly over
where you were held prisoner

401
00:26:26,566 --> 00:26:29,733
parachute down
and smother you with kisses.

402
00:26:29,766 --> 00:26:31,533
Oh!
And what about the savages?

403
00:26:31,566 --> 00:26:33,900
They'll have to wait their turn.

404
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,466
How is that for competition

405
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,833
they gave me Jungle Jim.

406
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,166
Oh, they're fighting over me!

407
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,733
Now, now, fellows.
Lets hold it down now.

408
00:26:49,766 --> 00:26:52,166
- Boys, boys
can we, can we take it easy!
- Hi, Sonny.

409
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,166
They are, they are fighting
over you no wonder too.

410
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,666
Okay, Abigail now
your time is up

411
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,033
make your decision
for whoever you pick,

412
00:26:59,066 --> 00:27:02,700
the two of you will go
on an all expense paid
two-week vacation

413
00:27:02,733 --> 00:27:04,300
in Wheeling, West Virginia.

414
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:06,433
Oh, oh, oh!

415
00:27:06,466 --> 00:27:09,200
Including, including
dinner at both restaurants
in Wheeling there.

416
00:27:09,233 --> 00:27:11,200
Oh, oh!

417
00:27:11,233 --> 00:27:15,500
- And your chaperone on this
dream trip of a life time--
- Who? Who? Who?

418
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:19,133
--will be none other than
the star of the silver
screen Ernest Borgnine!

419
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:20,966
Oh!

420
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,933
Ernest Borgnine?

421
00:27:22,966 --> 00:27:25,066
I've seen all his pictures.

422
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,533
I love the way he sings.

423
00:27:28,566 --> 00:27:32,166
This morning I just bought
a wallet with his picture in it.

424
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,800
All right now, what do you say?
What do you say?

425
00:27:35,833 --> 00:27:39,400
Well, I don't know how,
who to pick I want them both!

426
00:27:39,433 --> 00:27:41,766
- You want them both?
- That means only one thing--
We have a tie!

427
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,800
We have a tie here
on the Passion Game!

428
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:49,500
Looks like one of us is
gonna spend a lot time
with Ernest Borgnine!

429
00:27:49,533 --> 00:27:51,366
All right now, if you two
fellows will come on down

430
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,600
I'd like you to meet each
other and I'd like you to
meet Abigail Finchley.

431
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,500
Dad!

432
00:28:00,533 --> 00:28:01,933
Son!

433
00:28:01,966 --> 00:28:03,766
- What are you doing here?
- What am I doing here?

434
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,800
Well never mind about Dad,
what are you doing here?

435
00:28:06,833 --> 00:28:08,300
You're my husband!

436
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:09,933
You're related?
The two of you?

437
00:28:09,966 --> 00:28:12,300
Well, well he's my husband
and he's my father-in-law and

438
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:14,133
either one of them has a dime!

439
00:28:14,166 --> 00:28:15,533
Yeah, I had a dime.

440
00:28:15,566 --> 00:28:17,800
I had a dime but you
put it on your name!

441
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:19,100
Oh!

442
00:28:19,133 --> 00:28:20,400
Who's watching the kids?

443
00:28:20,433 --> 00:28:21,633
How do you like that!

444
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:24,700
Now I'm never gonna meet
Ernest Borgnine.

445
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:28,900
That's our show for tonight.

446
00:28:28,933 --> 00:28:30,966
Now, you'll be sure to watch
our other family show

447
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,566
I've Got a Secret Lover.

448
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,466
Goodnight everybody.

449
00:28:43,766 --> 00:28:46,466
You know in a few months the
American Medical Association

450
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,733
will be holding their annual
convention in New York City.

451
00:28:49,766 --> 00:28:52,933
Now each year the association
honors one colleague

452
00:28:52,966 --> 00:28:56,100
whom they feel has contributed
the most to modern medicine.

453
00:28:56,133 --> 00:29:01,066
Now last year the gentleman
they paid tribute to was a
Dr. Harry Hillary.

454
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:05,000
The discoverer of a new
important medication.

455
00:29:05,033 --> 00:29:08,333
Unfortunately, Dr. Hillary
was taken ill that day

456
00:29:08,366 --> 00:29:11,866
and accepting the award for him
was one of his assistants,

457
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:15,900
a gentleman who had not made
a speech since high school

458
00:29:15,933 --> 00:29:17,466
probably not even then

459
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:22,100
and he'd rather be
anywhere else as he hears
himself introduced.

460
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:41,466
Thank you, thank you
Mr. Chairman and, thank
you Mr. President,

461
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,000
and good evening doctors.

462
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:48,900
Now, I'm not a speaker

463
00:29:48,933 --> 00:29:54,900
but as you know,
Dr. Hilly Halery, Harry,
Harry Hillary

464
00:29:54,933 --> 00:29:58,633
was supposed to speak tonight
but he couldn't t make it

465
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:02,633
and believe you me
having to take his place

466
00:30:02,666 --> 00:30:09,100
is really having to fill
a couple of awfully big shoes.

467
00:30:09,133 --> 00:30:13,700
I don't mean to imply that
Dr. Hillary has big feet,

468
00:30:13,733 --> 00:30:18,266
just big shoes.

469
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:25,333
Anyway, well, gentlemen
our laboratory has finally
come up with it,

470
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:29,833
a perfect and I say perfect
tranquilizing pill.

471
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,633
I have one over here
it's a small thing I....

472
00:30:36,666 --> 00:30:42,066
and believe you me that the
soothing and the calming

473
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:45,400
and tranquilizing effects
that we've gotten into this pill

474
00:30:45,433 --> 00:30:47,333
has just been remarkable

475
00:30:54,066 --> 00:30:57,166
and it's different from
the other tranquilizers
on the market.

476
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,833
I mean, it's a real departure.

477
00:30:58,866 --> 00:31:03,500
It's neither Reserpine nor
Meprobamate nor Chlorpromazine;

478
00:31:03,533 --> 00:31:07,033
we call ours simply "Becalm".

479
00:31:07,066 --> 00:31:09,600
"Be calm with Becalm"
there's a slogan for you.

480
00:31:10,766 --> 00:31:13,666
In fact with these pills,
you can have four things.

481
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:18,000
You can have calmness,
you can have kind of confidence,

482
00:31:18,033 --> 00:31:23,633
you can have happiness,
and the fourth thing,

483
00:31:23,666 --> 00:31:26,466
the fourth thing...ah...

484
00:31:28,533 --> 00:31:30,666
is a good memory.

485
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:35,233
Being calm of course
has many advantages

486
00:31:35,266 --> 00:31:36,900
that makes you steady of hand,

487
00:31:36,933 --> 00:31:40,066
gives you a better penmanship
and helps you to write better

488
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:44,666
and in fact
some of you doctors really...

489
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:49,300
To prove the confidence they
give you we tried it out up
at the state prison there

490
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:53,933
and let me just read you
a paragraph from a letter
the warden wrote to us.

491
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,833
Okay, I think
I can remember that.

492
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:07,166
Oh, I can't actually...

493
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:12,066
Now, this is from the warden.

494
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,666
"After taking one of your pills,

495
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,266
I let our worst men
up out of solitary

496
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:21,066
and permitted them to throw
a party among themselves.

497
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,900
Head guard Jenkins who had
put these men in solitary

498
00:32:25,933 --> 00:32:29,600
took three of your pills
and attended the party unarmed.

499
00:32:31,133 --> 00:32:33,433
He will be buried on Wednesday."

500
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:41,633
Of course, the important
thing is he indeed enjoyed
the party.

501
00:32:41,666 --> 00:32:46,133
The most amazing thing about
these pills, however, is that
they have no side effects.

502
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:49,333
Most of your various pills
as you know they have on the
market today

503
00:32:49,366 --> 00:32:52,700
they have an awful lot of
trouble with various kinds
of side effects.

504
00:32:52,733 --> 00:32:53,966
[Sneezes]

505
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:59,733
Well, I seem to be getting
a little cold is there a
doctor in the house?

506
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,700
A little humor there.

507
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:10,100
As I say there, um, there,
there are no side effects to
these pills

508
00:33:10,133 --> 00:33:13,933
and we don't have to worry
about putting any labels
on the bottles,

509
00:33:13,966 --> 00:33:16,500
you know, causes drowsiness,

510
00:33:16,533 --> 00:33:22,166
do not drive, take, take while
driving things like that.

511
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:29,366
Anyway, I wish Dr. Hillary
could have been here.

512
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:34,866
He steered these experiments
on the pill but he couldn't
make it.

513
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:39,266
They've got him up at
Smile View.

514
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,633
He flipped out actually.

515
00:33:42,666 --> 00:33:44,700
He's on Phenobarbital.

516
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,766
He's on Phenobarbital.

517
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,900
You know,
I never cease to marvel at

518
00:34:05,933 --> 00:34:08,500
the poise and assurance
of the TV weather man

519
00:34:08,533 --> 00:34:10,733
but after all there's really
no pressure on him.

520
00:34:10,766 --> 00:34:15,466
The actual weather report
is compiled by a competent
meteorologist

521
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,433
and passed on to him
to relate to the viewers.

522
00:34:18,466 --> 00:34:22,400
I wonder however how calm
and poised he'd be if
something happened

523
00:34:22,433 --> 00:34:25,300
and he couldn't get through
to the weather bureau.

524
00:34:27,433 --> 00:34:29,333
What's that, Herb?

525
00:34:29,366 --> 00:34:30,633
You can't get through?

526
00:34:30,666 --> 00:34:31,566
Nothing?

527
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,100
We don't have anything?

528
00:34:33,133 --> 00:34:35,933
I'm on air in ten
seconds. You've got to
come up with something.

529
00:34:35,966 --> 00:34:38,633
Well, I'm at--Good evening!

530
00:34:38,666 --> 00:34:43,400
Good evening and welcome
to your 11:10 weather forecast

531
00:34:43,433 --> 00:34:49,900
just as it is every
evening at 11:10 along
about the same time.

532
00:34:49,933 --> 00:34:53,366
The, the present
temperature is, um,

533
00:34:57,266 --> 00:35:03,000
degrees and the wind is
coming from the, um,

534
00:35:03,033 --> 00:35:06,766
the wind is coming from
the window isn't it?

535
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,333
See, it's heated here
in the studio

536
00:35:08,366 --> 00:35:11,400
so we have no way of knowing
what the weather is outside.

537
00:35:11,433 --> 00:35:13,833
Well, we do have ways...

538
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:18,066
Let's have a look at the map.

539
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,766
Well there it is!
The good old USA.

540
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,000
Of course,
this is Maine right up here

541
00:35:30,033 --> 00:35:34,166
and then way over here
in the west is California,

542
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:38,000
let's just pencil that in,
California.

543
00:35:38,033 --> 00:35:39,500
There we go.

544
00:35:40,566 --> 00:35:42,233
How about that?

545
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:44,300
Anything, Herb? Ah-hum.

546
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:48,166
I was born right in here,
that's West Virginia.

547
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,300
I bet it's really cold
down there now.

548
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:52,066
It's cold in West Virginia,
huh, Herb?

549
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,933
He doesn't know.

550
00:35:55,933 --> 00:35:58,866
Anyway that reminds me
of a little story

551
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,533
about this guy who said

552
00:36:00,566 --> 00:36:04,033
"I understand you're
doing very well by your
gambling casino"

553
00:36:04,066 --> 00:36:05,600
and his friends said

554
00:36:05,633 --> 00:36:08,966
"Oh, the gambling casino is
just the front and the back
is a candy store."

555
00:36:13,733 --> 00:36:16,433
Of course,
I'm not a comedian or anything.

556
00:36:17,266 --> 00:36:18,966
I like to get my licks
in though.

557
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,033
At least you can do is laugh
it up, huh, Herb?

558
00:36:21,066 --> 00:36:24,066
Speaking of weather
as we are here tonight,

559
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:27,533
the other day my little
boy was asked by his
teacher to spell weather

560
00:36:27,566 --> 00:36:32,500
and he spelled it
"w-a-n-d-h-e-r" and I thought
that was just about the

561
00:36:32,533 --> 00:36:35,600
worst spell of weather
we've had in a long time.

562
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:42,433
Oh boy, anyway get me an
old report will you, Herb.

563
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:46,566
An old one, I don't
care how old, just get
it in here.

564
00:36:47,566 --> 00:36:49,933
Oh, folks a bulletin
just came in.

565
00:36:49,966 --> 00:36:52,833
"Heavy snow falls are expected
in the Valley Forge area,

566
00:36:52,866 --> 00:36:55,133
troops movements have been
ordered by General Washington."

567
00:36:55,166 --> 00:36:57,066
Thank you, Herb...

568
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,666
You're leaving?

569
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:03,600
Yeah, go ahead and leave,
check to see if it's raining.

570
00:37:03,633 --> 00:37:05,266
You're, you're sticking
huh, Fred?

571
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,833
Good, good old Fred,
Fred's here.

572
00:37:06,866 --> 00:37:08,766
Anyway, we're gonna
pause now folks,

573
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,766
be right back after these words
from our sponsor.

574
00:37:20,533 --> 00:37:22,300
Am I...

575
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,966
Well, it seems we, um,
no longer have a sponsor.

576
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,233
How about that!

577
00:37:32,266 --> 00:37:34,400
Anyway I'll tell you what
the weather's gonna be

578
00:37:34,433 --> 00:37:39,600
it's gonna be...we're gonna
have some low pressure area
here in the East

579
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:42,933
and, um, even temperatures
in the Midwest

580
00:37:42,966 --> 00:37:47,533
and higher temperature
out in the West. You get
the message NBC?

581
00:37:47,566 --> 00:37:49,466
Does that get through to you?

582
00:38:15,966 --> 00:38:18,533
Affair of the heart?

583
00:38:18,566 --> 00:38:21,233
Mm-hmm.

584
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:23,700
Me too.

585
00:38:23,733 --> 00:38:27,833
Why did I ever get mixed up
with a man like Harry?

586
00:38:27,866 --> 00:38:32,100
He was no good.
He treated me like dirt.

587
00:38:32,133 --> 00:38:35,033
He insulted me
in front of my friends.

588
00:38:35,066 --> 00:38:37,900
He never danced
with me at parties.

589
00:38:37,933 --> 00:38:40,133
I cooked and slaved for him

590
00:38:40,166 --> 00:38:44,866
and he was completely
insensitive to my needs.

591
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:48,233
My George was the same way.

592
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,733
George?

593
00:38:59,766 --> 00:39:01,566
He's a brute.
I'm gonna jump.

594
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,000
Oh no, no, no.

595
00:39:03,033 --> 00:39:06,333
Oh, you mustn't be alone
at a time like this.

596
00:39:06,366 --> 00:39:08,800
Oh, I can help you I know I can.

597
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:11,300
Just come with me
to my apartment.

598
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:13,000
I'll save you.

599
00:39:13,033 --> 00:39:15,233
Just come with me,
I'll get my car.

600
00:39:18,133 --> 00:39:20,133
It works every time.

601
00:39:44,266 --> 00:39:46,033
Oh, what floor did you want?

602
00:39:46,066 --> 00:39:47,900
Fifteen.

603
00:39:47,933 --> 00:39:49,466
Oh, I'm on the same floor.

604
00:39:52,666 --> 00:39:57,033
[Sings] By the time I get to
Phoenix you'll be crying...

605
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,700
Parum pump um parum
pum pum para ree...

606
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:05,833
- I think this elevator
stopped moving!
- Huh?

607
00:40:05,866 --> 00:40:07,833
I think this elevator's stuck!

608
00:40:07,866 --> 00:40:09,100
No, that's impossible.

609
00:40:09,133 --> 00:40:11,066
I've lived in this building all
my life there's never been any--

610
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,300
No, I don't think
we're going anywhere.

611
00:40:12,333 --> 00:40:13,233
This elevator's built
perfectly there never been...

612
00:40:13,266 --> 00:40:14,866
This elevator isn't
moving up or down...

613
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,366
Nothings ever
happened to this elevator...

614
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,500
- We're not going anywhere...
- It's never stopped...

615
00:40:17,533 --> 00:40:19,733
- We're stuck!
- This elevator's stuck!

616
00:40:20,733 --> 00:40:23,566
We're stuck in here!
Help somebody help us!

617
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,966
- Help!!
- Shh.

618
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,866
People could die in
elevators you know!

619
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,366
- Would you...
- I haven't even traveled...

620
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,700
Would you help, can
you hear me down there?

621
00:40:29,733 --> 00:40:31,966
I've never been to Poland...
I don't wanna die! Get out
of here!

622
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,933
We're stuck!

623
00:40:41,266 --> 00:40:44,000
Now listen,
in a situation like this

624
00:40:44,033 --> 00:40:47,400
it's very important
that we keep our cool

625
00:40:47,433 --> 00:40:50,100
and the way to keep our cool
is to just talk,

626
00:40:50,133 --> 00:40:54,300
just talk about anything
you know, so, so just go
ahead and talk.

627
00:40:55,366 --> 00:40:57,533
- Come on talk!
- Don't touch me!

628
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,733
You sex maniac!

629
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,133
I know about you guys.

630
00:41:11,166 --> 00:41:13,633
You follow girls on elevators
and you wanna talk

631
00:41:13,666 --> 00:41:15,066
and what do you want
to talk about?

632
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,633
Sex! Ha, ha, ha.

633
00:41:16,666 --> 00:41:20,433
Well, you talk on your side
of the elevator!

634
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,866
At a time like this I think
it becomes necessary

635
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,600
for one to keep a cool head,

636
00:41:38,633 --> 00:41:41,633
review the facts
and plan a course of action.

637
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:45,066
Now, on every elevator there
is an emergency telephone.

638
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:48,566
I think the first thing I
should do is to call the
emergency department

639
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,900
and inform them of
our predicament.

640
00:41:50,933 --> 00:41:54,600
However, the phone is on
your side of the elevator.

641
00:41:54,633 --> 00:41:56,600
May I use the phone?

642
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,000
All right.

643
00:42:05,866 --> 00:42:07,666
Cool heads prevail.

644
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,966
We're stuck and we're gonna die!
Get us out of here!

645
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,500
I don't know where we are,
somewhere between fifteen
and stuck--

646
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,500
Oh, you idiot!
Give me--

647
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,833
Hello, could you help me please?

648
00:42:21,866 --> 00:42:25,533
I'm stuck on this elevator
with a possible sex maniac!

649
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,433
Yes, thank you very much.
I'd appreciate it.

650
00:42:34,833 --> 00:42:38,000
Now, they're gonna try
and fix the elevator.

651
00:42:38,033 --> 00:42:41,466
We just have to
stay here and relax.

652
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,400
I'm as clam as a calm.

653
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:50,200
They're gonna help us?

654
00:42:50,233 --> 00:42:52,766
Just yes, just relax.

655
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,066
Uh-huh.

656
00:42:56,833 --> 00:43:00,333
Well, I guess I'll
miss my party.

657
00:43:00,366 --> 00:43:01,866
Party, what party?

658
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:05,933
Well I was going to a
birthday party for my friend
Pamela on fif-fifteen

659
00:43:05,966 --> 00:43:08,400
but I guess I'll miss it now.

660
00:43:08,433 --> 00:43:10,900
I was gonna take her
this bottle of scotch.

661
00:43:12,233 --> 00:43:14,533
That's a bottle of scotch?

662
00:43:14,566 --> 00:43:15,800
Uh-huh.

663
00:43:15,833 --> 00:43:22,366
Listen, why don't we just, um,
have a drink maybe?

664
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,966
I don't drink on elevators.

665
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,566
I don't drink on elevators
ordinarily either.

666
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,866
I mean, I don't drink
anywhere but I mean under
the circumstances

667
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:32,233
I think we should have
a little drink just to
calm you down!

668
00:43:47,433 --> 00:43:49,266
- How was it?
- Fine.

669
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,000
How do you feel?

670
00:44:23,066 --> 00:44:25,500
I feel warm, ha-ha.

671
00:44:27,366 --> 00:44:29,833
Deliciously warm.

672
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,966
Ha, all over...warm!

673
00:44:44,666 --> 00:44:47,000
Hey, what's your birth sign?

674
00:44:47,033 --> 00:44:51,000
Listen, I bet you're a Taurus,
the bull.

675
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:08,233
Say listen, I like to talk
to you for a minute.

676
00:45:10,233 --> 00:45:14,733
I really have a tremendous
amount of respect for you
I really do.

677
00:45:14,766 --> 00:45:17,966
I mean I've respected you ever
since we got on this elevator

678
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,366
and I was wondering if it
would be all right if I
cross the line

679
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,033
and came over your side
of the elevator?

680
00:45:23,066 --> 00:45:26,333
Ole Taurus, ole,

681
00:45:26,366 --> 00:45:29,466
Hey, you know what?

00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,200
You're a tiger. Grrrr.

684
00:45:34,633 --> 00:45:36,166
You remind me of someone.

685
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,100
Who?

686
00:45:37,133 --> 00:45:39,400
You know that sexy singer?

687
00:45:39,433 --> 00:45:41,133
Frank Sinatra.

688
00:45:43,666 --> 00:45:44,866
Come on.

689
00:45:46,933 --> 00:45:49,700
Scooby dooby doo.

690
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,900
Hello, room service?

691
00:45:54,933 --> 00:46:00,966
Can you pipe some music
up to the, um, couple on
the stuck elevator?

692
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,866
Ringa-ding-ding.

693
00:46:04,633 --> 00:46:07,100
[Music playing]

694
00:46:07,133 --> 00:46:09,633
May I have the pleasure
of this dance?

695
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:11,566
You bet your bird.

696
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,400
- Do you know something?
- Hmm?

697
00:46:18,433 --> 00:46:21,033
I think we should be
very proud of ourselves.

698
00:46:21,066 --> 00:46:24,100
I mean, the way we controlled
ourselves in this emergency.

699
00:46:24,133 --> 00:46:29,433
Yes, we've acted like two mature
people in complete control.

700
00:46:29,466 --> 00:46:31,333
That's right self control.

701
00:46:31,366 --> 00:46:35,500
I really place a lot of
value on self control I
wanna say and I love you!

maybe we could go to a
little restaurant and maybe
have a bite of dinner or,

734
00:48:30,266 --> 00:48:34,200
you know, little wine
candle light, a little
soft music.
