1
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,371
- Yes, I completely understand.

2
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:53,473
Protocol needs to be followed.

3
00:02:54,676 --> 00:02:55,877
I don't want to make excuses

4
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:00,548
but I went through a really
rough patch earlier in the year.

5
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:02,650
It did set me back a little.

6
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,690
You know I always deliver.

7
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,458
I understand.

8
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,697
I'll pick up rapidly
when I return.

9
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,632
Okay. Thanks.

10
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,968
Idiot.

11
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:28,442
You awake, babe?

12
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:30,978
Almost there.

13
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:05,980
- There you go, sir.

14
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,659
Are you coming?

15
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,562
- Yeah. Of course.

16
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,331
- What are you looking at?

17
00:04:27,702 --> 00:04:30,004
- I thought I saw...

18
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:31,939
Don't worry about it.

19
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,375
- Cozy, at least.

20
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,618
- Don't be silly.

21
00:05:17,752 --> 00:05:20,655
- I'm just so happy
we made this work.

22
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:24,692
This is going to be
so good for us.

23
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:31,464
- I wasn't expecting it
to be cold.

24
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:33,701
- Ah, most houses feel odd

25
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:36,403
when they haven't
been occupied in a while.

26
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:40,074
- It's clean.
- Mm-hm.

27
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:41,509
- And simple.

28
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:59,026
Well, let me know if you
discover anything fascinating.

29
00:05:59,227 --> 00:06:01,696
- Okay.
- I'm going to put these away.

30
00:06:03,798 --> 00:06:05,733
- It's not that clean.

31
00:06:57,685 --> 00:06:58,953
Babe?

32
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:00,621
- <i>Over here.</i>

33
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,568
- Isn't it too dark for you?

34
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:21,842
Much better.

35
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:24,145
- You must be tired.

36
00:07:24,612 --> 00:07:27,682
We would be sleeping by now
if we were back home.

37
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:31,018
- I feel fine.

38
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:34,689
- Had a good look around?

39
00:07:38,092 --> 00:07:40,127
- How did Charles
find this place?

40
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:42,029
- He stayed here before.

41
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,165
- Did he like it?

42
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:46,067
- I didn't ask.

43
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,935
He gave us a good deal on it.

44
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:02,583
I know it's not that glamorous

45
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:05,920
but at least
we have some privacy.

46
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:12,026
- It's fine, Kwame.

47
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:14,795
- Why don't you take a nap?

48
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:17,832
And maybe I can
make you some tea?

49
00:08:23,237 --> 00:08:26,107
- I saw someone
outside gawking at us.

50
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:28,542
- Hmm.

51
00:08:29,744 --> 00:08:31,946
It must be a curious neighbor.

52
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,615
I'm sure they meant well.

53
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,852
- I didn't get that impression.

54
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:39,920
- Hmm.

55
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:43,924
Maybe they thought
we were invading refugees?

56
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:48,829
Come on. Forget it.

57
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:53,000
I just want us to
settle in comfortably.

58
00:08:53,334 --> 00:08:55,636
We had a long flight.

59
00:09:26,801 --> 00:09:29,303
There's nothing in there.
I looked.

60
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,640
- I was just curious.

61
00:09:33,007 --> 00:09:34,575
- Hmm.

62
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:37,678
Curiosity killed the cat.

63
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:40,081
- What is that supposed to mean?

64
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:42,583
- Nothing, though.

65
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,319
- Everything is a joke to you.

66
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:03,324
- <i>Are you nearly done?</i>

67
00:12:03,357 --> 00:12:05,192
<i>I have a surprise for you.</i>

68
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:09,296
- I'll be out in a minute.

69
00:12:20,975 --> 00:12:23,010
I thought we were
going out for dinner?

70
00:12:23,277 --> 00:12:24,478
- Oh.

71
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,148
We have plenty
of going out to do.

72
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:31,352
I thought it would be lovely
to have a traditional meal

73
00:12:31,385 --> 00:12:33,988
for our first dinner in
a new country.

74
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:36,857
- Kenkey?

75
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:40,361
- I also brought some plantains,
spinach and dried fish

76
00:12:40,394 --> 00:12:42,196
if you want that instead.

77
00:12:43,264 --> 00:12:44,932
- Where did you get all this?

78
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:47,502
You brought this with us?

79
00:12:47,636 --> 00:12:49,403
You know if they had
seen this at the airport

80
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,305
they would have
sent us right back.

81
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,308
- It's from my grandmother.

82
00:12:54,475 --> 00:12:57,011
Now, before you get pissed
I want to clarify that

83
00:12:57,044 --> 00:12:58,979
she practically
begged me to bring them

84
00:12:59,013 --> 00:13:01,148
and I couldn't refuse her.

85
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:08,422
- It's okay. I wasn't going to
say anything terrible.

86
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:13,027
I suppose I can't blame you
for being discreet about it.

87
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,929
It's not like she would have
wanted me to know anyway.

88
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,831
She's never liked me.

89
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,435
- Of course she likes you.
Don't be silly.

90
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,605
- Have you noticed
the way she looks at me?

91
00:13:23,638 --> 00:13:26,240
She obviously
disapproves of our marriage.

92
00:13:29,143 --> 00:13:31,045
- That is all in your head.

93
00:13:34,315 --> 00:13:35,983
- Even what she
said to me at our wedding

94
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:37,451
sounded like a curse.

95
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:44,892
- Are you accusing
my grandmother of witchcraft?

96
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,096
- I'm just saying,
she doesn't like me.

97
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,435
- <i>I don't want to argue.</i>

98
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:56,504
<i>I can order you</i>
<i>whatever you want</i>

99
00:13:56,538 --> 00:13:59,440
<i>and then I'll have</i>
<i>all the kenkey to myself.</i>

100
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:04,612
- No, it's fine.

101
00:14:04,646 --> 00:14:06,581
<i>Let's have your special dinner.</i>

102
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:27,868
I wonder what was in
that picture frame.

103
00:14:33,107 --> 00:14:35,008
- What's wrong with the food?

104
00:14:35,142 --> 00:14:37,411
- Nothing. I'm full.

105
00:14:39,547 --> 00:14:41,616
- You barely even touched it.

106
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:46,654
- It's just a bit heavy for me
after the flight.

107
00:14:46,688 --> 00:14:50,023
- Jesus. I suggested we order,
but you said no.

108
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:53,127
- Don't swear, please.
That food will keep.

109
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:21,989
- You're right.

110
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:24,491
This empty frame is interesting.

111
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:28,128
Maybe it had a picture in it

112
00:15:28,162 --> 00:15:30,264
that the house owner didn't
feel comfortable leaving

113
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:32,299
available to strangers.

114
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:35,670
Or maybe it's
some sort of modern art.

115
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,043
- I don't see what's artistic
about an empty picture frame.

116
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:46,413
- You'd be surprised
what people call art these days.

117
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:58,492
- I'm positive there was
a picture in there.

118
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,231
- Well, it is a mystery
we will never know.

119
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:10,705
- Did Charles mention
who the owner is?

120
00:16:11,573 --> 00:16:15,175
- I didn't bother to ask.
I didn't think it was relevant.

121
00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:21,381
- I think it's a woman.

122
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:24,985
I found a makeup purse
in the bathroom.

123
00:16:26,754 --> 00:16:30,190
- Who cares?
It's not like we will meet them.

124
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:46,039
Beautiful, isn't it?

125
00:16:46,608 --> 00:16:49,711
So quiet and peaceful.

126
00:16:56,651 --> 00:16:58,620
Stop being silly.

127
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:01,556
I just want to cheer you up.

128
00:17:13,267 --> 00:17:15,168
- It's cold out here.

129
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:17,304
I think there are mosquitos.

130
00:17:34,722 --> 00:17:36,824
Maybe the battery is dead?

131
00:17:42,864 --> 00:17:43,831
- Well--

132
00:17:43,865 --> 00:17:47,301
- "The sensational Mareros
is back in town

133
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:48,836
after a long hiatus."

134
00:17:49,303 --> 00:17:52,139
It looks interesting.
We should check it out.

135
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,709
It's nearby.

136
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:57,177
- I thought...

137
00:17:59,781 --> 00:18:01,649
Never mind.

138
00:18:01,883 --> 00:18:03,450
- You thought what?

139
00:18:04,652 --> 00:18:06,654
- We just got here.

140
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,491
- Come on. It'll be fun.

141
00:18:12,694 --> 00:18:14,729
This is a new start for us,
right?

142
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:17,832
Let's be spontaneous.

143
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:37,885
- Babe,
come and do the merengue.

144
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:15,288
- It feels like a graveyard.

145
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:20,695
- It is late at night, babe.
People are sleeping.

146
00:19:20,728 --> 00:19:22,530
This isn't that a crowd.

147
00:19:23,731 --> 00:19:26,801
- I'm aware of that,
mister smart ass.

148
00:19:28,636 --> 00:19:32,406
It just feels really eerie.

149
00:19:36,711 --> 00:19:38,880
- It is awfully quiet.

150
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:20,588
- Did you--
What-What was that?

151
00:20:21,589 --> 00:20:24,692
- What?
- I think someone
is at the front door.

152
00:20:26,794 --> 00:20:30,497
- Lay back down, babe.
It's the squirrels.

153
00:20:30,531 --> 00:20:32,466
- Can you go and check?

154
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:39,741
- All right.

155
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:13,608
Who is it?

156
00:21:55,616 --> 00:21:56,984
- Who was it?

157
00:21:58,786 --> 00:22:00,054
- No one.

158
00:22:17,605 --> 00:22:19,841
Oh, come on, babe.

159
00:22:22,543 --> 00:22:25,079
- I don't think that sound
was from a squirrel.

160
00:22:25,112 --> 00:22:28,749
- Okay, who do you think it was?

161
00:22:29,817 --> 00:22:32,419
There wasn't anybody out there.

162
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,494
What's wrong?

163
00:22:42,597 --> 00:22:43,965
Hmm?

164
00:22:44,265 --> 00:22:45,900
Are you upset?

165
00:22:58,012 --> 00:23:00,014
- I'm feeling a bit tired.

166
00:23:54,835 --> 00:23:56,003
That's not funny.

167
00:23:56,037 --> 00:23:57,838
Quit being silly.

168
00:24:08,115 --> 00:24:10,483
I know you came
into the bathroom.

169
00:26:00,694 --> 00:26:01,962
- <i>Mommy!</i>

170
00:26:16,877 --> 00:26:18,345
- Did you sleep okay?

171
00:26:24,385 --> 00:26:25,352
- Okay.

172
00:26:28,022 --> 00:26:29,957
- You want to join me for a jog?

173
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:34,195
- I don't think
I'm feeling up to it.

174
00:26:34,328 --> 00:26:35,830
- Are you sure?

175
00:26:37,031 --> 00:26:39,166
- Positive.
You go ahead.

176
00:26:41,702 --> 00:26:44,205
- Do you want me to get you
breakfast while I'm out?

177
00:26:52,446 --> 00:26:54,181
Oh, Vivian and Anthony,

178
00:26:54,215 --> 00:26:56,117
they're joining us
for dinner tonight.

179
00:26:57,418 --> 00:26:59,086
They said they want to see us.

180
00:26:59,453 --> 00:27:01,388
- Are we going
somewhere for dinner?

181
00:27:01,989 --> 00:27:05,392
- I thought we can have
a nice dinner in the back yard.

182
00:27:05,826 --> 00:27:07,061
Vivian is bringing something

183
00:27:07,094 --> 00:27:10,965
so I thought you could make that
delicious South African dish.

184
00:27:11,198 --> 00:27:14,201
What's it called?
It escapes my memory.

185
00:27:17,872 --> 00:27:21,842
You should be excited.
We haven't seen them in years.

186
00:27:24,912 --> 00:27:27,181
- I just wish
you had told me earlier.

187
00:27:37,224 --> 00:27:38,859
- See you soon.

188
00:29:17,958 --> 00:29:19,994
Babe, are you home?

189
00:29:33,874 --> 00:29:35,242
Hello?

190
00:29:39,246 --> 00:29:40,881
Kwame?

191
00:29:58,132 --> 00:30:00,301
Abena, stop this nonsense.

192
00:30:13,314 --> 00:30:15,015
Whew.

193
00:33:25,607 --> 00:33:27,374
- <i>Abena, is that you?</i>

194
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,317
What happened?

195
00:33:40,087 --> 00:33:41,689
- I don't know.

196
00:33:41,723 --> 00:33:44,191
I couldn't control it.

197
00:33:45,793 --> 00:33:48,195
- I think I have
a first aid kit.

198
00:33:49,664 --> 00:33:52,099
Does it hurt terribly?
- Yes. It's throbbing.

199
00:33:59,841 --> 00:34:01,509
- Let me see.

200
00:34:15,623 --> 00:34:17,625
Is this about the food?

201
00:34:18,058 --> 00:34:21,361
You can walk me through it,
and I'll just do it myself.

202
00:34:21,461 --> 00:34:23,698
You're trying to get out
of the evening.

203
00:34:33,373 --> 00:34:35,610
- What? No.

204
00:34:36,844 --> 00:34:38,746
It was...

205
00:34:41,448 --> 00:34:45,085
I can't explain it.
Let's just forget it.

206
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,056
Don't worry about dinner.
I can handle it.

207
00:34:58,566 --> 00:35:00,702
- You go through
two intersections

208
00:35:00,735 --> 00:35:02,870
and then the house
is on your right.

209
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,572
Mm-hm.

210
00:35:04,872 --> 00:35:07,474
Uh, it's an older house.

211
00:35:09,844 --> 00:35:11,278
Hello?

212
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:13,313
Anthony?

213
00:35:15,315 --> 00:35:18,318
Yeah,
the reception here is terrible.

214
00:35:19,787 --> 00:35:21,522
Text me if you get lost.

215
00:35:21,723 --> 00:35:24,559
Yes, I know.
GPS can be misleading.

216
00:35:24,692 --> 00:35:26,126
Mm-hm.

217
00:35:27,227 --> 00:35:28,596
Hello?

218
00:36:24,317 --> 00:36:25,318
- Hey!
- Hey!

219
00:36:25,352 --> 00:36:26,587
- You weren't kidding
about the directions.

220
00:36:26,621 --> 00:36:27,955
- Yeah.

221
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:31,926
You are looking good!
- Thanks!

222
00:36:31,959 --> 00:36:34,327
You're looking
not so bad yourself.

223
00:36:34,629 --> 00:36:36,196
How long has it been?

224
00:36:36,931 --> 00:36:38,633
- A while.

225
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:41,736
Vivian! Hey.
- Hey, Kwame.

226
00:36:44,204 --> 00:36:45,707
- Where's your beautiful wife?

227
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,407
- Oh, Abena!

228
00:36:48,408 --> 00:36:49,777
Abena?

229
00:36:59,887 --> 00:37:01,288
Abena?

230
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:10,665
She's...

231
00:37:17,304 --> 00:37:20,273
- Welcome, guys.
Sorry, I was freshening up.

232
00:37:20,307 --> 00:37:21,776
- Hi, Abena.

233
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:25,412
You look fabulous!
- Thank you.

234
00:37:25,847 --> 00:37:29,016
- What did you do to your hand?
- Nothing.

235
00:37:32,987 --> 00:37:34,488
- Hey.

236
00:37:35,022 --> 00:37:36,591
- Let me take that for you.

237
00:37:36,624 --> 00:37:39,359
- It's just a fruit tart.

238
00:37:39,392 --> 00:37:42,329
I got it at the French bakery
that opened up near our place.

239
00:37:42,362 --> 00:37:44,065
- Lovely. Thank you.
- Yeah.

240
00:37:44,098 --> 00:37:45,700
- Thanks.

241
00:37:46,033 --> 00:37:48,368
- Uganda must be
treating you guys well.

242
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,805
Who hooked you up
with this place?

243
00:37:51,371 --> 00:37:54,307
- You remember Charles?
- Charles?

244
00:37:54,341 --> 00:37:55,810
Yes! Yes!

245
00:37:55,843 --> 00:37:58,445
I haven't heard from him
in a while.
- Really?

246
00:37:58,713 --> 00:38:01,649
That's strange considering
you live in the same city.

247
00:38:01,916 --> 00:38:03,651
- Things are different here.

248
00:38:04,051 --> 00:38:07,287
People are busy,
and it's easy to lose touch.

249
00:38:13,828 --> 00:38:16,396
- You want a tour?
- I'd love that.

250
00:38:16,429 --> 00:38:17,865
- Oh, your earrings
are gorgeous.

251
00:38:17,899 --> 00:38:19,867
- Oh, thank you, darling.

252
00:38:19,901 --> 00:38:21,334
- Where did you get them?

253
00:38:21,368 --> 00:38:22,937
- They were a birthday gift
from Anthony.

254
00:38:24,005 --> 00:38:25,606
- Lovely.

255
00:38:33,748 --> 00:38:36,316
- Why don't you show
Vivian around?

256
00:38:58,573 --> 00:38:59,941
- Let me try.

257
00:39:07,682 --> 00:39:09,349
Hmm.

258
00:39:10,651 --> 00:39:13,020
- There's nothing interesting
in there anyway.

259
00:39:16,891 --> 00:39:19,492
And... bathroom.

260
00:39:25,733 --> 00:39:28,435
And our bedroom.

261
00:39:29,704 --> 00:39:34,075
And that, my friend,
is the grand tour.

262
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:41,549
- Welcome to L.A.

263
00:39:42,783 --> 00:39:45,385
You get a hug
from Homeland Security?

264
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:49,489
- Just a fist bump,
but the Libyans behind us...

265
00:39:49,991 --> 00:39:52,425
- Yeah. Crazy times, huh?
- Mm-hm.

266
00:39:54,528 --> 00:39:56,797
- It's cooler in here
than it is outside.
- Yeah.

267
00:39:56,831 --> 00:39:59,667
- It's cold, actually. Good A/C.

268
00:39:59,934 --> 00:40:03,004
- No A/C. I've been
freezing since we got here.

269
00:40:09,844 --> 00:40:12,546
- Why didn't you guys
come stay with us?

270
00:40:14,048 --> 00:40:16,483
- Kwame wanted to stay alone.

271
00:40:16,517 --> 00:40:20,487
He's calling this
a "romantic interlude"

272
00:40:20,588 --> 00:40:22,623
but he still wants
home-cooked meals.

273
00:40:34,001 --> 00:40:36,003
- Good thing Vivian's
driving later.

274
00:40:36,103 --> 00:40:38,005
You need to send me the recipe.

275
00:40:40,775 --> 00:40:43,044
- Babe, can you turn on
the heat a little bit?

276
00:40:43,077 --> 00:40:46,747
- Heating?
It's L.A. It's always summer.

277
00:40:46,781 --> 00:40:48,749
- Vivian is cold.

278
00:40:51,686 --> 00:40:53,754
- It's okay
if it's too much trouble.

279
00:40:54,055 --> 00:40:55,856
- No, not at all.

280
00:40:56,257 --> 00:40:57,858
How was the tour?

281
00:40:58,326 --> 00:40:59,961
- It's nice.

282
00:41:00,861 --> 00:41:02,630
Very sparse.

283
00:41:02,663 --> 00:41:04,865
The owner must be a minimalist.

284
00:41:05,366 --> 00:41:07,168
- Or maybe a bachelor.

285
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,570
- Abena thinks it's a spinster.

286
00:41:16,143 --> 00:41:18,012
Can I get you
something to drink?

287
00:41:18,045 --> 00:41:19,013
Wine?

288
00:41:19,046 --> 00:41:20,581
- Sounds good.

289
00:41:20,715 --> 00:41:21,882
What are you drinking, honey?

290
00:41:21,916 --> 00:41:24,151
- Old Fashioned.
Want to try some?

291
00:41:24,285 --> 00:41:25,519
- No, thanks.

292
00:41:39,734 --> 00:41:42,269
- Let me attend to
this heating situation.

293
00:41:55,049 --> 00:41:56,751
- This is interesting.

294
00:41:57,218 --> 00:41:58,819
- What, honey?

295
00:41:59,453 --> 00:42:01,889
- Have you noticed
this picture frame?

296
00:42:04,925 --> 00:42:05,926
- Yeah.

297
00:42:06,227 --> 00:42:08,896
- It's a large picture frame
with no picture.

298
00:42:09,363 --> 00:42:11,999
I think it's odd.

299
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,069
- <i>Lazy decorating,</i>
<i>if you ask me.</i>

300
00:42:15,102 --> 00:42:16,771
<i>What do you think, Vivian?</i>

301
00:42:18,205 --> 00:42:20,608
- <i>I think the frame</i>
<i>is beautiful.</i>

302
00:42:27,281 --> 00:42:31,185
- I see you guys
appreciate modern art.

303
00:42:32,353 --> 00:42:34,922
- I'm not so sure I see
the modern art element here

304
00:42:34,955 --> 00:42:37,024
but that's just me.

305
00:42:40,795 --> 00:42:43,664
- So, our dinner menu
for this evening is

306
00:42:43,697 --> 00:42:46,000
a delicious South African dish

307
00:42:46,033 --> 00:42:48,903
which my wife will be preparing.

308
00:42:49,003 --> 00:42:51,172
She learned it
during her stay there.

309
00:42:51,338 --> 00:42:53,841
- Lovely!
When were you in South Africa?

310
00:42:53,874 --> 00:42:54,809
- Last year.

311
00:42:54,842 --> 00:42:57,711
I was there for
an advanced nursing program.

312
00:42:57,945 --> 00:43:00,281
- Clearly, we haven't
spoken in far too long.

313
00:43:00,314 --> 00:43:02,650
I didn't know
you went back to school.

314
00:43:03,651 --> 00:43:05,386
- Her hospital even paid for it

315
00:43:05,419 --> 00:43:07,955
because they think
she's so talented.

316
00:43:09,657 --> 00:43:10,991
- Gosh, we haven't been
back to South Africa

317
00:43:11,025 --> 00:43:12,193
in such a long time.

318
00:43:12,226 --> 00:43:14,995
Anthony's work doesn't
allow us to travel very much.

319
00:43:15,296 --> 00:43:16,964
Too demanding.

320
00:43:16,997 --> 00:43:19,133
- We'll make a better plan
for vacation this year.

321
00:43:19,166 --> 00:43:20,835
- I know, honey.

322
00:43:21,235 --> 00:43:24,939
- I only managed to visit Abena
once during her stay there.

323
00:43:39,153 --> 00:43:42,323
What do you guys think about
having dinner in the back yard?

324
00:43:42,356 --> 00:43:44,158
- Fantastic idea.
What do you think, honey?

325
00:43:44,191 --> 00:43:46,060
- Of course.
It's warmer outside.

326
00:43:46,994 --> 00:43:49,130
- Chilly?
Are you still feeling cold?

327
00:43:50,865 --> 00:43:52,700
- Well, it's better.

328
00:43:57,872 --> 00:44:00,207
- How much does
a house like this cost?

329
00:44:01,308 --> 00:44:03,110
- $1.5 mil.

330
00:44:03,144 --> 00:44:05,246
- Jeez, that is insane.

331
00:44:05,279 --> 00:44:06,447
- It's all about location, man.

332
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,083
All the houses are in the
millions, even the tear-downs.

333
00:44:09,116 --> 00:44:10,818
- Wow.

334
00:44:11,018 --> 00:44:15,156
Wow. Charles must be making
a killing at this job.

335
00:44:15,189 --> 00:44:17,158
- Yeah,
it's definitely very lucrative

336
00:44:17,191 --> 00:44:19,927
if you're renting out
million dollar homes.

337
00:44:20,027 --> 00:44:21,362
So, does he actually
own this house

338
00:44:21,395 --> 00:44:24,298
or is he just an agent
for some of the people?

339
00:44:24,331 --> 00:44:27,735
- I don't know, to be honest.

340
00:44:28,068 --> 00:44:31,772
- I get all types, people
with post-traumatic stress

341
00:44:31,805 --> 00:44:33,107
insomnia,

342
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:35,342
emotional distress,
that sort of thing.

343
00:44:35,376 --> 00:44:38,045
I usually incorporate hypnosis.

344
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,282
- Does it help?

345
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:44,318
- For the most part.

346
00:44:44,351 --> 00:44:46,921
It's more effective
if the client is mentally

347
00:44:46,954 --> 00:44:50,824
and emotionally open to it
so it's on a case-by-case basis.

348
00:44:52,493 --> 00:44:53,427
- Hm.

349
00:44:53,562 --> 00:44:55,996
- You guys have any other
plans for the weekend?

350
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:57,431
- Oh, we haven't
discussed it yet.

351
00:44:57,464 --> 00:44:59,833
We went to
a local bar last night.

352
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,335
- Was it fun?

353
00:45:01,603 --> 00:45:03,771
- It was an empty dive bar.

354
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:10,945
- But there was this Latin
singer with an unusual voice.

355
00:45:11,178 --> 00:45:14,715
It was very interesting music.
Nothing I've heard before.

356
00:45:15,382 --> 00:45:18,986
- L.A. breeds all sorts of
weird and wonderful musicians.

357
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,255
There's a lot to
do in this city.

358
00:45:21,288 --> 00:45:24,825
Maybe I could steal you
one day for a girls' night out?

359
00:45:24,858 --> 00:45:27,127
- Definitely. That sounds fun.

360
00:45:28,929 --> 00:45:30,798
- So, how's work?

361
00:45:31,465 --> 00:45:34,536
- Well, it pays the bills.

362
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:39,840
- These carrots are delicious.
Here, try one.

363
00:45:46,347 --> 00:45:49,283
- Very tasty.
- Yeah. Where'd you get them?

364
00:45:49,483 --> 00:45:52,853
- Somewhere nearby.
Kwame bought them on his run.

365
00:45:59,126 --> 00:46:00,894
- How's your mom and dad?

366
00:46:03,565 --> 00:46:05,399
- My mom is okay.

367
00:46:05,766 --> 00:46:11,539
My dad suffered a heart attack
a few months ago and...

368
00:46:13,073 --> 00:46:15,209
it's taken a toll on my mom.

369
00:46:15,409 --> 00:46:17,545
- I'm so sorry to hear that.

370
00:46:18,312 --> 00:46:20,114
Is he okay?

371
00:46:23,417 --> 00:46:26,453
- He's not so good, but--

372
00:46:26,588 --> 00:46:28,556
- Sorry to interrupt, ladies.

373
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:33,394
I'm here for some refills and
then I will be out of your way.

374
00:46:33,894 --> 00:46:36,263
- You guys need to
take it easy on the drinks.

375
00:46:36,297 --> 00:46:39,400
- Oh, it is under control.
I promise.

376
00:46:40,467 --> 00:46:43,003
Mm. Smells divine in here.

377
00:46:43,037 --> 00:46:45,472
Mind if I have a taste?

378
00:46:52,946 --> 00:46:54,381
Mm.

379
00:46:55,316 --> 00:46:57,351
That's a different recipe?

380
00:46:57,918 --> 00:47:00,120
It doesn't seem spicy.

381
00:47:00,421 --> 00:47:01,855
That can use more spices

382
00:47:01,889 --> 00:47:04,191
and maybe
a little bit more salt.

383
00:47:04,291 --> 00:47:06,528
I thought
I got the right recipe.

384
00:47:15,202 --> 00:47:17,371
- What the hell, Kwame?

385
00:47:18,138 --> 00:47:19,574
- What?

386
00:47:32,554 --> 00:47:34,955
I was just trying to help.

387
00:47:37,391 --> 00:47:39,460
- Why don't you
finish the rest of it?

388
00:47:41,328 --> 00:47:43,598
You have it all figured out,
right?

389
00:47:49,704 --> 00:47:52,674
I told you it's been
a while since I made it.

390
00:47:52,707 --> 00:47:57,211
You can be such
an asshole sometimes.

391
00:48:01,448 --> 00:48:03,585
I thought we were
here for a break.

392
00:48:07,154 --> 00:48:09,657
- I thought we were
here to start over.

393
00:48:18,999 --> 00:48:21,603
- I don't understand
how you expect me

394
00:48:21,636 --> 00:48:24,639
to just move past it so quickly.

395
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,455
- Where are they?

396
00:48:42,256 --> 00:48:44,191
- They're talking.

397
00:48:45,459 --> 00:48:47,194
- You mean arguing?

398
00:48:48,195 --> 00:48:51,165
- No, don't interrupt.
Let them sort it out.

399
00:49:10,184 --> 00:49:11,952
- I'll handle dinner.

400
00:49:20,027 --> 00:49:22,129
- Wow, that's a huge mansion.

401
00:49:22,564 --> 00:49:24,998
- He's got a couple of them,
apparently.

402
00:49:25,567 --> 00:49:28,636
- It's in Bel Air,
one of the most expensive

403
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:30,471
neighborhoods in Los Angeles.

404
00:49:30,605 --> 00:49:33,173
It's not as interesting
as it appears.

405
00:49:33,273 --> 00:49:37,579
Now, how does a regular priest
afford a $10 million house?

406
00:49:37,612 --> 00:49:39,480
He's a con artist and a crook.

407
00:49:39,514 --> 00:49:41,448
- He's upset
because he hit on me.

408
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:44,619
- That, too.

409
00:49:45,185 --> 00:49:48,590
He used to hit on many of
the women in his congregation.

410
00:49:49,189 --> 00:49:51,391
He's the reason
I stopped going to church.

411
00:49:52,292 --> 00:49:55,563
He's an embarrassment to
the Christian community.

412
00:49:56,129 --> 00:49:58,700
- Why do you hate him so much?

413
00:49:58,999 --> 00:50:00,501
- It's not hate.

414
00:50:01,001 --> 00:50:03,437
I'm simply addressing the issue.

415
00:50:04,104 --> 00:50:08,141
He makes some of us who
work hard for a living look bad.

416
00:50:10,645 --> 00:50:12,112
Apparently, this guy started

417
00:50:12,145 --> 00:50:14,047
this apostolic church
movement in Brazil

418
00:50:14,081 --> 00:50:16,416
where he was making a killing
luring his congregation

419
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:19,286
into performing
human sacrifices.

420
00:50:19,554 --> 00:50:21,689
Some kind of voodoo bullshit.

421
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:25,693
Some of his followers
became very rich overnight.

422
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,428
It was like the rags
to riches story,

423
00:50:28,462 --> 00:50:30,464
but without
the hard work part.

424
00:50:30,732 --> 00:50:32,299
- It's all just speculation.

425
00:50:32,332 --> 00:50:33,835
- Oh, are you defending him now?

426
00:50:33,868 --> 00:50:35,502
- Don't be silly.

427
00:50:37,404 --> 00:50:41,308
- Abena used to work with
this guy at her hospital.

428
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:45,112
Why don't you tell the story,
babe?

429
00:50:45,212 --> 00:50:47,080
- I don't think it's relevant.

430
00:50:47,347 --> 00:50:49,751
- Come on, Abena.
- Anthony.

431
00:50:57,190 --> 00:50:59,259
- I think
we should start a church.

432
00:50:59,527 --> 00:51:01,596
It seems like that's
where all the money is

433
00:51:01,629 --> 00:51:04,766
and maybe you could be
our pastor, Anthony.

434
00:51:06,568 --> 00:51:09,202
- You know,
not all churches are like that.

435
00:51:13,675 --> 00:51:15,510
- I'd like to propose a toast.

436
00:51:16,143 --> 00:51:18,713
I want to thank you
guys for joining us

437
00:51:18,746 --> 00:51:22,617
for a wonderful dinner
and a delicious meal

438
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:25,285
prepared by my beautiful wife.

439
00:51:26,788 --> 00:51:32,392
Let's toast to friendship,
love and success.

440
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:35,395
- To friendship,
love and success.

441
00:51:35,429 --> 00:51:37,097
- Success!

442
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:46,574
Ah, I think I need to
go to the men's room.

443
00:51:48,843 --> 00:51:50,845
- You remember where it is,
right?

444
00:51:51,244 --> 00:51:54,616
- I think I can manage to find
my way to the men's room.

445
00:51:56,084 --> 00:51:59,286
- Anthony, always the comedian.

446
00:52:05,325 --> 00:52:07,227
I'm sorry about earlier.

447
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:11,365
Can you forgive me?

448
00:52:13,901 --> 00:52:16,269
Can I at least have a smile?

449
00:52:19,707 --> 00:52:21,676
- Aw.

450
00:52:33,521 --> 00:52:36,591
- You should know better.
- I know.

451
00:52:36,624 --> 00:52:39,393
It's just that
I blame it on this

452
00:52:39,426 --> 00:52:42,730
which I firmly believe
you should try it.

453
00:52:42,764 --> 00:52:44,398
- Don't let him
lure you into that.

454
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:50,538
- It's actually very tasty.
It'll perk you up.

455
00:52:50,905 --> 00:52:52,540
- Are you trying to
get me drunk?

456
00:52:52,573 --> 00:52:54,742
- It's all in the plan.

457
00:53:11,425 --> 00:53:13,661
- Vivian? Is it you?

458
00:53:40,788 --> 00:53:43,290
- Hey, did you come looking for
me while I was in the bathroom?

459
00:53:43,323 --> 00:53:44,859
- No.

460
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,262
- I thought I smelled
your perfume.

461
00:53:49,296 --> 00:53:50,397
- Dirty mind.

462
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:56,604
- Who are you texting?
- My other husband.

463
00:53:57,905 --> 00:54:00,307
Just responding to
some work emails.

464
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:01,509
- You should tell your clients

465
00:54:01,542 --> 00:54:03,044
not to bother you
on the weekends.

466
00:54:03,077 --> 00:54:04,679
- I can't exactly ignore them.

467
00:54:05,613 --> 00:54:07,715
- It's amazing how
dedicated you are.

468
00:54:07,749 --> 00:54:09,617
- Ha! Sure.

469
00:54:09,951 --> 00:54:12,285
Till it interferes
with your plans.

470
00:54:13,721 --> 00:54:15,523
- How are you doing, Abena?

471
00:54:17,357 --> 00:54:17,992
Hm?

472
00:54:18,025 --> 00:54:19,627
- I'm fine.

473
00:54:21,696 --> 00:54:23,698
- I see you've joined the club.

474
00:54:23,731 --> 00:54:25,833
Drinking Old Fashioneds now.

475
00:54:25,867 --> 00:54:27,835
Did yours talk you into it?

476
00:54:28,435 --> 00:54:30,571
- I've had them before,
actually.

477
00:54:30,605 --> 00:54:31,438
They're quite good.

478
00:54:31,471 --> 00:54:33,975
- Be careful.
They creep up on you.

479
00:54:34,008 --> 00:54:37,011
- Don't listen to him, honey.
He's drunk.

480
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:45,586
- Oh, I just remembered
something, Anthony.

481
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:49,456
Excuse us, ladies.

482
00:54:49,557 --> 00:54:51,058
- Man talk, huh?

483
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:27,949
Kwame...

484
00:57:32,586 --> 00:57:35,756
- Are you okay, honey?
Hm? You're sweating.

485
00:57:36,223 --> 00:57:39,060
- It must be the drink.
I told you it creeps up on you.

486
00:57:40,227 --> 00:57:42,129
- You should drink some water,
babe.

487
00:57:42,163 --> 00:57:44,065
Do you want to go lie down?

488
00:57:46,067 --> 00:57:47,668
- No.

489
00:57:48,035 --> 00:57:50,671
I'm fine.
It's probably just jet-lag.

490
00:57:53,541 --> 00:57:56,043
- Here. Wipe your face.

491
00:57:56,644 --> 00:57:57,678
Huh?

492
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,601
- <i>Abena?</i>

493
00:58:20,634 --> 00:58:21,802
<i>Abena?</i>

494
00:58:21,836 --> 00:58:23,504
Wake up.

495
00:58:33,314 --> 00:58:35,049
What happened?

496
00:58:35,149 --> 00:58:36,117
Huh?

497
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:37,018
Are you sick?

498
00:58:37,051 --> 00:58:38,319
- It's the drink,
I'm telling you.

499
00:58:38,352 --> 00:58:40,021
- Shut up, Anthony.

500
00:58:41,255 --> 00:58:43,924
- Maybe the alcohol
was a bit too strong.

501
00:58:44,025 --> 00:58:47,061
- No, I'm okay. I'm fine.

502
00:58:48,662 --> 00:58:50,898
- Maybe it's time
to move inside.

503
00:58:50,931 --> 00:58:52,933
It's cold out here anyway.

504
00:59:13,788 --> 00:59:16,123
Do you need to
go to the hospital?

505
00:59:18,125 --> 00:59:19,894
- I don't think so.

506
00:59:22,663 --> 00:59:23,597
- Don't worry.

507
00:59:23,631 --> 00:59:26,600
It's probably just
a combination of...

508
00:59:26,634 --> 00:59:30,037
stress and jet-lag, and alcohol.

509
00:59:39,246 --> 00:59:43,784
- Jet-lag doesn't make you
see things, in my experience.

510
00:59:58,065 --> 01:00:00,301
- Maybe we can try hypnosis?

511
01:00:01,902 --> 01:00:06,373
It might help you clarify
what you're experiencing.

512
01:00:10,878 --> 01:00:13,214
Just think about it.
No pressure.

513
01:00:35,736 --> 01:00:37,705
- Fucking battery.

514
01:00:39,206 --> 01:00:41,008
- Hey...

515
01:00:41,543 --> 01:00:43,878
- What are you guys up to?

516
01:00:44,411 --> 01:00:46,981
You're drunk, honey.

517
01:00:47,414 --> 01:00:50,184
- I just want to dance.
- To no music?

518
01:00:50,417 --> 01:00:52,186
- Are you feeling better?

519
01:00:52,753 --> 01:00:55,222
- Just a little headache.

520
01:00:59,426 --> 01:01:01,962
- Ah...

521
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:11,172
- Let's do it.

522
01:01:11,272 --> 01:01:12,806
- Do what?

523
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,675
- I'm ready to try it, Vivian.

524
01:01:17,344 --> 01:01:19,280
- I want to
try hypnosis on Abena.

525
01:01:21,782 --> 01:01:23,918
- Why do you need hypnosis?

526
01:01:24,385 --> 01:01:26,887
Do you think that's a good idea?

527
01:01:28,022 --> 01:01:30,257
- It's a simple
therapeutic technique.

528
01:01:30,791 --> 01:01:32,793
It's nothing alarming.

529
01:01:33,294 --> 01:01:35,396
You can sit at
the dining table and stay quiet

530
01:01:35,429 --> 01:01:38,799
or go outside and I'll
let you know when I'm done.

531
01:01:40,801 --> 01:01:42,336
- We'll cooperate.

532
01:01:47,808 --> 01:01:49,743
- Close your eyes.

533
01:01:53,047 --> 01:01:55,716
I just want you to focus
on your breath...

534
01:01:56,317 --> 01:01:58,485
as it comes into your chest

535
01:01:58,919 --> 01:02:00,988
and then your belly,

536
01:02:04,091 --> 01:02:07,494
and focus on the breath
as it leaves your body.

537
01:02:08,128 --> 01:02:09,830
Inhale...

538
01:02:10,831 --> 01:02:12,766
exhale.

539
01:02:13,568 --> 01:02:16,804
You're feeling very relaxed.

540
01:02:19,541 --> 01:02:22,409
I'm so sorry, guys.
I can't help it.

541
01:02:23,444 --> 01:02:25,813
Please continue, Vivian.

542
01:02:28,882 --> 01:02:30,951
What? I said I was sorry.

543
01:02:32,353 --> 01:02:34,355
- I think we should
probably get going.

544
01:02:36,558 --> 01:02:37,992
Are you upset?

545
01:02:38,125 --> 01:02:39,527
- I'm too tired to
sit through this

546
01:02:39,561 --> 01:02:41,962
and Vivian can come
back tomorrow and do it.

547
01:02:46,834 --> 01:02:48,369
- Thank you guys for coming.

548
01:02:48,603 --> 01:02:51,005
- Dinner was lovely.

549
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:00,515
Talk soon.

550
01:03:00,548 --> 01:03:02,416
- Absolutely.

551
01:03:04,051 --> 01:03:07,855
Good to see you, Vivian.
- Thanks for having us.

552
01:03:09,923 --> 01:03:11,458
I'll come back.

553
01:03:19,433 --> 01:03:21,168
- Good night.

554
01:03:44,659 --> 01:03:46,894
- Well, that was weird.

555
01:03:47,629 --> 01:03:50,565
I mean, it was good to see them,
but that was...

556
01:03:52,399 --> 01:03:54,268
- Something's not right.

557
01:03:56,203 --> 01:03:58,105
Do you think they're okay?

558
01:03:59,239 --> 01:04:04,111
- Yeah. Look, most couples
go through issues, you know.

559
01:04:04,345 --> 01:04:08,315
- We seem to be doing pretty
great with very few issues.

560
01:04:08,882 --> 01:04:11,285
- We're the exception
to the rule.

561
01:04:16,658 --> 01:04:18,459
- I'm worried about her.

562
01:04:21,362 --> 01:04:25,032
- Look, Abena's a big girl.
She can look after herself.

563
01:04:26,701 --> 01:04:28,502
- I know.

564
01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:32,574
I think it's something
more than that.

565
01:04:49,957 --> 01:04:52,092
I think I've got to
go back and see Abena.

566
01:04:52,359 --> 01:04:54,027
- What, now?

567
01:04:54,696 --> 01:04:56,296
- Yeah.

568
01:04:58,031 --> 01:05:00,234
- Can't you just
go in the morning?

569
01:05:02,136 --> 01:05:04,071
- I've got to go.

570
01:05:05,707 --> 01:05:08,976
You remember what happened
to my patient last year.

571
01:05:09,644 --> 01:05:12,446
- Look, you've got to stop
blaming yourself for that.

572
01:05:13,515 --> 01:05:15,550
It wasn't your fault.

573
01:05:20,087 --> 01:05:22,590
- You should go and get
some sleep. It'll be fine.

574
01:05:25,627 --> 01:05:26,694
- Okay.

575
01:05:26,728 --> 01:05:28,730
If you need anything,
give me a call.

576
01:05:28,763 --> 01:05:30,532
- Of course I will.

577
01:05:33,033 --> 01:05:34,968
- Love you.
- Bye.

578
01:05:52,152 --> 01:05:54,522
- This should help
with the headache.

579
01:06:07,769 --> 01:06:10,538
Snap out of it, please.

580
01:06:17,211 --> 01:06:19,547
I can't deal with
this right now.

581
01:06:21,716 --> 01:06:24,117
- You know you're selfish,
right?

582
01:06:25,085 --> 01:06:27,221
Was the laughter necessary?

583
01:06:27,387 --> 01:06:29,289
- Me, selfish?

584
01:06:29,657 --> 01:06:33,393
You can't even disclose to me
why you need hypnosis.

585
01:06:33,528 --> 01:06:35,763
I thought that you
were doing better.

586
01:06:37,431 --> 01:06:40,367
Are you crazy like
one of Vivian's clients now?

587
01:06:50,277 --> 01:06:52,780
- I just miss her so much.

588
01:06:53,213 --> 01:06:55,683
- And you think I don't?

589
01:06:56,183 --> 01:06:59,052
But we have to move forward,
Abena.

590
01:06:59,086 --> 01:07:02,256
We can't live in the past.
It's been nearly two years.

591
01:07:02,289 --> 01:07:05,459
- I'm sorry
if I can't just move on.

592
01:07:06,159 --> 01:07:11,431
It's like part of my body
was ripped away.

593
01:07:38,793 --> 01:07:41,261
- You work with the pastor.

594
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:45,432
You went to South Africa.

595
01:07:45,567 --> 01:07:48,135
We have taken this trip.

596
01:07:49,771 --> 01:07:51,806
What's going to help?

597
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:53,473
Huh?

598
01:07:54,542 --> 01:07:56,711
Hypnosis?

599
01:08:01,448 --> 01:08:04,151
- I should have
never gone to work.

600
01:08:12,492 --> 01:08:14,829
- It was an accident.

601
01:08:19,934 --> 01:08:22,202
But, of course...

602
01:08:24,939 --> 01:08:27,407
it will always be my fault.

603
01:08:44,458 --> 01:08:48,596
I thought coming here
was going to help us heal.

604
01:08:49,329 --> 01:08:51,733
- And how is that
working out for you?

605
01:08:53,768 --> 01:08:57,137
Because so far,
it seems to be all about you.

606
01:08:57,572 --> 01:08:59,741
You just brought me
to tag along.

607
01:09:02,877 --> 01:09:07,247
I have almost no say
in what we do.

608
01:09:07,515 --> 01:09:09,449
"Abena, we should eat at home.

609
01:09:09,483 --> 01:09:12,720
And you should cook a meal.
Oh, it's fun and relaxing."

610
01:09:12,754 --> 01:09:14,388
What's the point of
coming somewhere new

611
01:09:14,421 --> 01:09:16,490
just to end up staying indoors?

612
01:09:16,691 --> 01:09:18,826
- Didn't we go check out
that band last night?

613
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:20,828
- I wouldn't call that
going out in a city

614
01:09:20,862 --> 01:09:22,730
with lots of
amazing things to do.

615
01:09:22,764 --> 01:09:25,232
- But it was your choice
to go there, not mine.

616
01:09:25,265 --> 01:09:27,234
- Don't turn it on me.

617
01:09:27,434 --> 01:09:28,536
You haven't expressed interest

618
01:09:28,569 --> 01:09:30,872
in going anywhere
since we got here.

619
01:09:31,371 --> 01:09:32,740
Correct me if I'm wrong,

620
01:09:32,774 --> 01:09:34,909
but what happened to
going to the beach?

621
01:09:36,476 --> 01:09:39,781
It was obviously fake promises,
as usual.

622
01:09:42,884 --> 01:09:46,386
I heard you
on the phone in the car.

623
01:09:46,854 --> 01:09:48,890
You didn't make quota.

624
01:09:50,758 --> 01:09:53,895
Kwame, I just started this job.

625
01:09:53,928 --> 01:09:54,996
- I know where this is going.

626
01:09:58,666 --> 01:10:00,635
Hold that thought.

627
01:10:07,542 --> 01:10:08,876
Vivian...

628
01:10:09,376 --> 01:10:11,779
I thought you guys went home.

629
01:10:12,046 --> 01:10:14,214
Too drunk to drive, eh?

630
01:10:14,849 --> 01:10:16,751
- Anthony's at home.

631
01:10:17,952 --> 01:10:19,821
I came back for Abena.

632
01:11:23,751 --> 01:11:28,589
Look, we can hold off on
the hypnosis and just talk.

633
01:11:30,625 --> 01:11:32,894
It's equally therapeutic.

634
01:11:48,643 --> 01:11:50,611
After it happened

635
01:11:50,645 --> 01:11:53,648
did you think about
consulting someone...

636
01:11:54,447 --> 01:11:56,416
like a therapist?

637
01:11:57,218 --> 01:11:59,954
- I did counseling
through my church.

638
01:12:00,888 --> 01:12:03,891
I found things to occupy my time

639
01:12:03,925 --> 01:12:06,727
and I thought
I had gotten better

640
01:12:06,861 --> 01:12:09,530
until we arrived here.

641
01:12:10,264 --> 01:12:14,535
And then suddenly,
it's like it happened yesterday.

642
01:12:15,703 --> 01:12:18,639
Or like it's happening now.

643
01:12:22,176 --> 01:12:25,112
I don't feel
in control of my mind.

644
01:12:26,814 --> 01:12:28,716
I hate it.

645
01:12:32,419 --> 01:12:35,556
If you honestly think
hypnosis could help...

646
01:12:42,196 --> 01:12:43,898
- Tell me...

647
01:12:45,132 --> 01:12:47,835
what happened
when you came here?

648
01:12:51,471 --> 01:12:53,841
- I've been having these dreams.

649
01:12:55,076 --> 01:12:58,579
Kwame and I,
we're on the beach.

650
01:13:02,183 --> 01:13:05,086
And then I hear her
calling to me.

651
01:13:06,921 --> 01:13:09,724
Kwame runs to help

652
01:13:12,627 --> 01:13:15,696
and I walk over
to see what's happening.

653
01:13:17,732 --> 01:13:19,901
But it's a stranger.

654
01:13:21,736 --> 01:13:24,404
A woman, at first.

655
01:13:25,673 --> 01:13:26,741
And then...

656
01:13:26,774 --> 01:13:31,078
she transforms into this...

657
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,849
thing.

658
01:13:40,221 --> 01:13:42,857
But I don't think it's a dream.

659
01:13:44,792 --> 01:13:48,562
I think it's here in this house.

660
01:13:54,268 --> 01:13:57,204
- I need a glass of wine.
Do you want a glass of wine?

661
01:15:30,131 --> 01:15:31,866
Vivian?

662
01:16:28,022 --> 01:16:29,890
<i>Vivian.</i>

663
01:16:30,891 --> 01:16:32,927
<i>Vivian.</i>

664
01:17:09,029 --> 01:17:10,698
Vivian?

665
01:17:18,239 --> 01:17:19,773
- <i>Abena?</i>

666
01:17:19,807 --> 01:17:21,208
<i>Abena?</i>

667
01:17:21,809 --> 01:17:23,377
<i>Abena?!</i>

668
01:17:31,318 --> 01:17:32,987
- <i>Abena, wake up!</i>

669
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:35,122
- <i>Abena, wake up!</i>
- <i>Wake up!</i>

670
01:17:35,156 --> 01:17:38,025
- <i>Wake up!</i>
- <i>Can you hear us?</i>

671
01:18:35,182 --> 01:18:36,750
- Babe.

672
01:18:38,152 --> 01:18:40,354
- I feel lightheaded.

673
01:18:47,361 --> 01:18:48,929
- Vivian.

674
01:18:52,199 --> 01:18:54,435
Vivian! Vivian!

675
01:19:39,313 --> 01:19:41,081
Hold this on her head.

676
01:19:44,351 --> 01:19:45,419
I'm going to call for help.

677
01:19:50,324 --> 01:19:52,192
Shit!

678
01:19:58,098 --> 01:20:00,000
Anthony, pick up the phone.

679
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:05,439
Anthony, pick up!

680
01:20:07,308 --> 01:20:09,243
Pick up the phone.

681
01:21:46,974 --> 01:21:49,042
- <i>Abena...</i>

682
01:21:52,179 --> 01:21:55,949
<i>Where are you?</i>

683
01:22:01,422 --> 01:22:04,291
<i>Oh, I see.</i>

684
01:22:05,192 --> 01:22:08,195
<i>This is some kind</i>
<i>of hide and seek.</i>

685
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:43,063
<i>I wish I could join you.</i>

686
01:22:58,145 --> 01:23:01,081
<i>I know you are in there.</i>

687
01:23:04,318 --> 01:23:06,554
<i>Should I come join you?</i>

688
01:23:20,167 --> 01:23:21,435
- It's not Kwame.

689
01:23:21,468 --> 01:23:25,105
You're not Kwame.
I know you're not Kwame.

690
01:23:35,115 --> 01:23:36,518
- <i>Abena?</i>

691
01:23:41,589 --> 01:23:43,223
<i>Abena?</i>

692
01:23:45,158 --> 01:23:46,761
<i>Abena?</i>

693
01:23:52,499 --> 01:23:54,702
Abena, help me.

694
01:23:56,203 --> 01:23:57,605
I'm scared!

695
01:24:05,112 --> 01:24:06,548
- Vivian?

696
01:25:51,686 --> 01:25:53,253
- Hello?

697
01:26:02,764 --> 01:26:04,331
Hello?

698
01:26:12,907 --> 01:26:14,709
Hey, guys?

699
01:26:25,687 --> 01:26:27,454
- <i>Anthony...</i>

700
01:26:36,764 --> 01:26:39,466
<i>Anthony!</i>

701
01:26:57,719 --> 01:26:59,654
<i>Anthony...</i>

702
01:27:02,924 --> 01:27:04,491
- Vivian?

703
01:27:10,765 --> 01:27:12,399
- Vivian?

704
01:27:18,506 --> 01:27:20,373
Help me.

705
01:27:28,583 --> 01:27:30,484
Help...

706
01:27:30,518 --> 01:27:32,419
me.

707
01:27:35,056 --> 01:27:37,692
Help me!
