1
00:00:23,862 --> 00:00:26,302
Don't! Don't come!

2
00:00:26,303 --> 00:00:29,303
Death, that's what you want, isn't it?

3
00:00:29,352 --> 00:00:31,852
No! I don't want to die!

4
00:00:37,712 --> 00:00:39,352
You're my assistant aren't you?

5
00:00:39,352 --> 00:00:41,352
I'll die with you!

6
00:00:43,712 --> 00:00:45,100
Let's go to heaven

7
00:00:45,193 --> 00:00:47,333
where your mom and dad
are waiting for you

8
00:01:35,321 --> 00:01:37,066
"Sakajo Ryotarou"

9
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,336
Amane Misa

10
00:02:08,406 --> 00:02:11,210
Your life's been extended

11
00:02:17,473 --> 00:02:20,418
Are you an ... angel?

12
00:02:20,696 --> 00:02:23,309
No, I'm the Reaper

13
00:02:23,838 --> 00:02:25,246
The Reaper£¿

14
00:02:31,638 --> 00:02:33,092
Cool!

15
00:02:34,527 --> 00:02:38,208
The human whose name is written in the note shall...

16
00:02:39,399 --> 00:02:40,399
die.

17
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:18,320
Akino SHiori was shot and killed by a woman at the museum

18
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,320
Misora Naomi, the murderer, also killed herself there

19
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,320
Did they know each other?

20
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,320
I don't know

21
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,330
Yagami Light, the boy who saw it, was Shiori's boyfriend, wasn't he?

22
00:04:29,011 --> 00:04:31,324
Were they involved in a love triangle?

23
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,314
That's enough! Where do you think you are!

24
00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:37,256
Are you from their college? Can I ask you couple questions?

25
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,835
No, we're not!

26
00:04:38,836 --> 00:04:41,617
Ah, you're detectives! Then I want to ask some...

27
00:04:41,652 --> 00:04:42,449
Get out of here!

28
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,152
The Police...?

29
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,879
I feel sorry for both Shiori and Light

30
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,320
Who said that Misora was an excellent FBI agent?

31
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,320
She was too obsessed with catching the one who killed her fiance

32
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,330
I don't understand why she suspected Light

33
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,300
They're here

34
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,320
Yagami Light

35
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,320
the hero of this tragedy who lost his girlfriend

36
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,320
His father is the director of the detective team

37
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,330
And his sister... must still be in high school

38
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,330
I heard Kira has something to do with this case

39
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,300
Don't say such nonsense

40
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,330
Kira didn't kill her

41
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:38,340
Light must be hurt by such a heartless rumor

42
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,310
You're right..

43
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:48,992
Everyone feels sorry for you, Light

44
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,908
Dad, I will avenge Shiori

45
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:18,279
Sorry, I didn't want you involved

46
00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:22,348
I'll definitely make Kira pay

47
00:06:22,607 --> 00:06:24,514
You ARE the Kira, aren't you?

48
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,340
5 seconds!

49
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,310
Opening!

50
00:06:48,553 --> 00:06:50,138
Good evening

51
00:06:50,927 --> 00:06:52,954
Welcome to Evening Spot, I'm Nishiyama Saeko

52
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,110
Nakayama Kiyohiko, who murdered a girl, just died of heart attack

53
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:04,893
Nakayama was wanted for murder

54
00:07:05,672 --> 00:07:11,025
But today in Shibuya he suddenly fell

55
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,825
and died of heart attack

56
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:18,990
Today was the 10th birthday of Aoki Takuma, the victim's brother

57
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:23,310
My sister asked Kira-sama from heaven to do this

58
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,320
I think this was a gift from her

59
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:33,330
Currently, L, the mysterious detective ICPO invited to investigate

60
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:42,820
has concluded that Kira lives in Kanto, Japan, but has not achieved any further result

61
00:08:06,047 --> 00:08:09,997
This is Kira's handy work

62
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:15,954
The police has not admitted though

63
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,340
You must leave everything communication device, including mobile phone here

64
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,360
Ryuzaki, here is Mr. Yagami Light

65
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,330
Ryuzaki£¿

66
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,370
I see, a false name to protect you from Kira

67
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:35,370
You're so sharp. How did you see it?

68
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:38,370
You can see it easily if you think of the cases logically

69
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,350
I've heard about your extraordinary ability

70
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:48,310
Not sure if they were being sarcastic..

71
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,999
I suspect you to be Kira

72
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,887
Are you joking?

73
00:09:57,887 --> 00:10:00,897
I don't like to joke

74
00:10:00,898 --> 00:10:01,898
Then why did you invite such a dangerous person?

75
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:06,370
Because if I die, you'll be suspected the most

76
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,403
You mean, if you die, I'm Kira

77
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,380
How did you came up with that?

78
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,380
Our investigation status has leaked out to Kira

79
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:18,320
so I had the FBI team investigate our members and their family

80
00:10:18,321 --> 00:10:20,782
including you, Light

81
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:24,096
I felt like someone's been following me

82
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,279
As a result, we've lost

83
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,320
Every member of the team was killed. This is a shame

84
00:10:32,188 --> 00:10:35,188
But we succeeded in profiling the most suspicious person

85
00:10:36,234 --> 00:10:39,488
out of the people we have investigated

86
00:10:39,523 --> 00:10:40,871
You mean me?

87
00:10:40,831 --> 00:10:45,186
Yes, and we set cameras and taps in your room

88
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,350
That's illegal...!

89
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,765
Did my father agree too?

90
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,360
It was a special case

91
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,360
If so, it must've proved that I'm innocent

92
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,672
I bet you can outwit them easily

93
00:11:00,866 --> 00:11:05,309
Besides, Misora Naomi reached you although we didn't give her any information

94
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,855
Hey, Wait!

95
00:11:08,146 --> 00:11:13,037
You're too mean... Light just lost his grilfriend!

96
00:11:13,534 --> 00:11:14,826
because Misora Naomi killed her!

97
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,797
Kira can control the dying situations

98
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:22,320
You think that I controlled Shiori and Misora and killed them...

99
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,067
What for£¿

100
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,360
To make people feel sorry for you and to join our team

101
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,612
to approach me and...

102
00:11:29,413 --> 00:11:30,976
to kill me

103
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,370
You bastard!

104
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:36,664
You may have a superior intelligence, but you don't have a heart!

105
00:11:37,016 --> 00:11:41,600
Mr. Matsuda, I can prove my innocence on my own

106
00:11:43,775 --> 00:11:46,923
So, how do you thik I killed those people?

107
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,390
That's the only think I want to know

108
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:55,320
It will give the answer to every mystery

109
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,360
If all the mysteries were solved and it told that I'm Kira...

110
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,727
Unfortunately, death penalty

111
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,340
Checkmate

112
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,380
bravo

113
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,390
We don't suspect you Light

114
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:25,469
Ryuzaki too. He examined you just to know the probability

115
00:12:25,969 --> 00:12:27,554
You need to suspect, when you're investigating

116
00:12:28,267 --> 00:12:32,406
But the more important thing is to stop Kira from killing people as soon as possible

117
00:12:32,896 --> 00:12:34,618
I also hope...

118
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,970
that you're not Kira

119
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:42,742
If you get the Reaper's eye, you can see his real name

120
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,380
by giving me half of your lifetime

121
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,412
You can kill him when you want!

122
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:53,390
The Diet has stopped the regular council by the speech from the PM

123
00:12:55,979 --> 00:12:58,773
that crime rate is decreasing because of Kira

124
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,652
but many of the citizens and the young members of the Diet

125
00:13:01,687 --> 00:13:05,340
rather seem to support his opinion

126
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,380
Killing is bad, but

127
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,380
a nation often kills criminals under the law

128
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,850
The matter is whether it is a "right killing" or not

129
00:13:18,388 --> 00:13:23,186
from this point of view, Kira's killing seems to be justified

130
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:28,252
Who? Who made this idiot in charge of the government?

131
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,400
We must not allow this situation to happen, sir

132
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,400
Yagami, what are you thinking?

133
00:13:33,935 --> 00:13:36,401
Where and what is your team doing?

134
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:40,820
Everything we do is based on L's directions

135
00:13:43,182 --> 00:13:45,182
What kind of person is L?

136
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,350
Is he American?

137
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,428
I can't tell you, sir

138
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:50,880
You!

139
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,254
L is risking his own life

140
00:13:53,534 --> 00:13:56,235
We believe his will and follow him

141
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,400
I understand

142
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,133
You can have request money or staff as much as you need, so...

143
00:14:02,517 --> 00:14:04,187
catch Kira right away!

144
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:17,062
Nothing exciting at the Sakura TV festival

145
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,390
Isn't there any entertainment?

146
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,390
TV stars for example?

147
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:25,390
That'll cause a riot!

148
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:28,126
No, I don't think it's gonna happen

149
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,400
I beg you Mr. Demegawa! We might lose Saeko's life

150
00:14:34,072 --> 00:14:36,712
You must leave it to me as I've been doing research on Kira

151
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,905
I understand him the most

152
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:41,380
You are kind of..

153
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,380
unattractive

154
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,380
Morning!

155
00:14:47,142 --> 00:14:49,112
Not attractive?

156
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,390
-Saeko, this is our chance!
-I'm so excited

157
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,390
Are you sure it's ok to broadcast it without boss's permission?

158
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:59,400
Protect me even it gets you fired!

159
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,400
If we can get the ratings, they'll put hundreds of testimonials on the wall!

160
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,410
It's going to be the true Sakura TV festival

161
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,923
News isn't a comedy show!

162
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,410
Who do you think you are?

163
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:17,350
Your head and here should both be a little softer

164
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,390
Save the sexual harassment..

165
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:24,350
This is a case of kill or cure

166
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,400
What?

167
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,400
Director

168
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,410
We've got information that Sakurat TV

169
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,993
will broadcast a message from Kira

170
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,420
3 days ago

171
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:50,390
We received two videotapes from somone who called himself the Second Kira

172
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,390
The Second Kira?

173
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,390
In the first videotape

174
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:58,350
there was a notice that the murderer who was arrested recently would die

175
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,400
and yesterday, he did die of heart attack

176
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,410
Ms. Sagami, confirm it please

177
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,410
Yes

178
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,410
Also, the Second Kira

179
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:14,370
requested us to broadcast the other video from 2:59 pm today

180
00:16:16,427 --> 00:16:18,897
We have not watched this video

181
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,390
As I said in the beginning

182
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:25,825
the Second Kira demanded us to broadcast the video

183
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:30,577
or he would kill all of our staff from the top

184
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:36,397
Please understand that we are hostages of Kira

185
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,360
As journalists, we risk our lives to broadcast this

186
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,504
Everyone should stay calm

187
00:16:50,504 --> 00:16:54,444
Is this.. really happening here?

188
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,217
I don't want to goto Sakura TV festival anymore

189
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,400
It's now 2:59. Please watch this video

190
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,370
Here it is

191
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,410
I am the Second Kira

192
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:11,410
Just like Kira, I also hate evil

193
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:15,370
and I want to create an ideal world where there's no crime

194
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:20,140
Anyone who opposes Kira is my enemy

195
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,420
Anyone who disturbes Kira is letting brutal criminals go free

196
00:17:25,204 --> 00:17:28,266
so they must die so the society can become peaceful

197
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:35,706
Hibima Kazuhiko, one of the opposers who's now appearing on Taiyo TV

198
00:17:35,741 --> 00:17:37,798
Will die of heart attack

199
00:17:39,534 --> 00:17:42,111
Kira's judgement is autocratic.

200
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,410
He is just a cruel murderer.

201
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,258
But..

202
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:48,370
What's wrong with Taiyo TV?

203
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,145
-Hurry!

204
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:59,661
He certainly is an autocrat
We might be slaves of Kira

205
00:18:07,191 --> 00:18:09,217
Mr. Hibima?

206
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,380
Somebody.. Help

207
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:14,380
Someone please help

208
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,420
You alright¡­

209
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,420
Can you hear me

210
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,390
Still breathing?

211
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:29,430
Mr. Hibima unfairly insisted that Kira was evil and criticized him

212
00:18:31,838 --> 00:18:33,194
He deserves death

213
00:18:33,194 --> 00:18:35,072
Stop it!

214
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:39,360
You must accept Kira so we can create a future together

215
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,410
What are you doing?

216
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,410
Make them stop showing it now!

217
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,420
The producer of the program doesn't answer the phone

218
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,420
They just want the audience rating

219
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,390
Mr. Mogi arrived at the scene?

220
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,390
The furture is with Kira

221
00:18:57,597 --> 00:19:02,752
If you agree with Kira's justice, gather in from of Sakura TV

222
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,940
Let's raise our voices for Kira

223
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,410
Only Kira can purify this unclean world

224
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,410
He's right!

225
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:15,380
Kira is doing the right thing!

226
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,420
Crime is decreasing thanks to Kira

227
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:21,420
That critic sure deserves it!

228
00:19:22,087 --> 00:19:24,915
Today's the Kira festival!

229
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,112
I'm scared! Let's go!

230
00:19:27,612 --> 00:19:29,860
Come one, let's see what'll happen.
I'm actually a Kira supporter

231
00:19:29,895 --> 00:19:31,057
What?

232
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,400
Kira¡­

233
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,410
I won't let anyone interfer with what Kira's doing

234
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:44,410
Anyone does will die

235
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,420
Police!

236
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,499
Mr. Mogi

237
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:48,679
Stop!

238
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,420
Don't support Kira's justice

239
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:55,430
Do you defend the cruel mass murderer?

240
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:58,103
Don't forgive him!
Get away from here now!

241
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,430
What are you talking about? The police is totally useless

242
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:02,400
ya¡­

243
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,677
Kira is now protecting the world

244
00:20:06,188 --> 00:20:09,184
No, Kira is a cruel murderer!

245
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,450
Wake up and disperse!

246
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,450
Kira taught us...

247
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,420
Disperse¡­

248
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,074
You are in danger too!

249
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:21,380
.... that the laws never help us

250
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:29,430
Do you hear the cries of the people?

251
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:34,786
People who lose their love can never be healed

252
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,851
Stop it

253
00:20:37,851 --> 00:20:39,201
Mr. Mogi!

254
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,410
Mr. Mogi¡­

255
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,420
Mr. Mogi¡­

256
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:49,390
Mr. Mogi¡­

257
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,735
Do you hear the murderer's laugh?

258
00:20:52,035 --> 00:20:55,957
Who took lives of innocent people, and live without being punished

259
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:01,430
You're in danger!
Get away from here!

260
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,440
Step aside!

261
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,410
Let me through

262
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,410
Disperse¡­

263
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,450
Get back

264
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,292
What are you doing?

265
00:21:14,163 --> 00:21:15,306
You must stay away from here

266
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:34,406
Kira has begun to act

267
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,440
for a bright, ideal world

268
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,110
Camera no. 1, zoom in on the fallen policemen

269
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,410
Great! He's dead!

270
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:50,071
You'll be dead if you go there

271
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,460
We can't just sit here and watch TV!

272
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,963
This Kira might be able to kill just by seeing the faces

273
00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:00,642
The the policemen near the scene to keep away

274
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,400
Yes

275
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,410
Ryuzaki...!

276
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,400
We must fight with Kira

277
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,450
But

278
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,450
We must rescue Sayu!

279
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:19,460
This Kira's targets

280
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,460
are people who interrupt the broadcasting

281
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:24,460
Sayu should be safe

282
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,460
And Kira, if you're watching TV,

283
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,470
Come here now

284
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:32,116
I promise I will help you

285
00:22:33,327 --> 00:22:36,885
As you see, I have the eye

286
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,400
Let me see your Reaper, then I'll show you mine

287
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,420
Reaper£¿

288
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:48,871
Do you expect me to believe that such things really exist?

289
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:52,181
It must mean the ability of killing

290
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,221
And let's create a new world together!

291
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,440
What do you mean by the new world!

292
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,440
You murderer!

293
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,440
How can you kill people so easily?

294
00:23:08,072 --> 00:23:10,321
What did they do to you£¿

295
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,410
Murderer!

296
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,450
Murderer!

297
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,449
Sayu...! Don't upset him!

298
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,430
Murderer

299
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,430
Murderer¡­

300
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,430
Murderer

301
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:48,420
Murderer!

302
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,797
What are you doing!

303
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,420
A car just crashed into the station

304
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:48,450
We don't know yet what exactly happened

305
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,420
Is that..

306
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,466
really?

307
00:24:56,096 --> 00:24:56,925
Sayu!

308
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,616
Dad?

309
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,092
Cover your face with this

310
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,440
go inside

311
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,420
Mogi..

312
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:37,669
We'll inform you as soon as we find out what is happening at the entrance

313
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,480
Alright, cut to commercials

314
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,490
The ratings will be 30... no, 40 at least

315
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:49,420
L's message earned 35%

316
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,460
You can't go in

317
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,430
Step aside

318
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,470
Is that you?

319
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:00,470
You're the producer£¿

320
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,738
You can't enter without...

321
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:05,387
The police£¿Stop broadcasting now!

322
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,690
If we do that, we're gonna die

323
00:26:08,385 --> 00:26:09,808
You want to see innocent people...

324
00:26:10,423 --> 00:26:11,474
forced to get involved and killed?

325
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,398
I got it!

326
00:26:14,081 --> 00:26:14,979
Calm down¡­

327
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:18,762
Got it..

328
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:21,494
Hello?

329
00:26:22,192 --> 00:26:22,862
Thank you

330
00:26:26,979 --> 00:26:29,555
Ryuzaki, I told them to stop broadcasting

331
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,949
I go the videotapes too

332
00:26:32,256 --> 00:26:33,118
This is as I thought

333
00:26:33,362 --> 00:26:34,178
It was Mr. yagami!

334
00:26:34,951 --> 00:26:37,046
I can't do this in such as way

335
00:26:37,267 --> 00:26:38,938
Dad, where is Sayu? Is she alright?

336
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,615
Light..

337
00:26:42,042 --> 00:26:44,127
Yes, we're both fine

338
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,658
Mr. Yagami, are you still wearing a helmet?

339
00:26:48,486 --> 00:26:50,276
No, I took it off

340
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:51,902
I'll go pick them up

341
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:53,924
Please arrange for the permission to enter the studio

342
00:26:53,925 --> 00:26:55,094
You'll be Kira's target!

343
00:26:55,292 --> 00:26:57,301
Dad and Sayu will not be harmed inside the studio

344
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:08,355
The Second Kira surely has the Reaper's eye

345
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,273
You've got a nice buddy huh?

346
00:27:11,308 --> 00:27:12,480
No

347
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,990
There's no proof that he's not my enemy

348
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:17,431
Then isn't it dangerous to go?

349
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:21,156
If he truely supports me, he'll be a strong weapon to wipe out L

350
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:23,401
I must find him before L does

351
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,470
Move out

352
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:39,430
Sakura TV has stopped broadcasting, following the order from the police

353
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,480
Taiyo TV

354
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,480
is protesting against Sakura TV

355
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,490
According to Taiyo TV

356
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:50,450
Mr. Hibima died because of Sakura TV

357
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,084
Misa, the recording is cancelled

358
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,500
yeah, alright

359
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,060
It can't be helped

360
00:28:02,345 --> 00:28:03,222
I need to change clothes

361
00:28:13,077 --> 00:28:15,778
The Kira didn't show up

362
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,440
-Sayu
-Light

363
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,128
I was worried about you

364
00:28:41,128 --> 00:28:41,989
Mr. Mogi..

365
00:28:42,412 --> 00:28:43,450
He was killed¡­

366
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:54,500
Yes, I will report it

367
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,460
Excuse me

368
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,450
Kira...?

369
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:18,122
I found you

370
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:21,133
I knew he'd come to me

371
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,295
Yagami...

372
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,595
Tsuki?

373
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:38,510
The videotapes were dispatched

374
00:29:38,863 --> 00:29:41,863
at a post office in Kita-ku Osaka

375
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:43,480
The fingerprints are so small

376
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,490
so 'he' might be 'she'

377
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:50,490
Are you sure that these are from the Second Kira?

378
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:53,490
It may be a fake

379
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:57,500
You mean, this might be a fake by Kira that there are more Kiras?

380
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,585
Light, what do you think?

381
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,192
That's impossible

382
00:30:02,565 --> 00:30:04,854
And this Kira can kill only by seeing the faces

383
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,510
The video images were childish,

384
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,510
trying to use the media slyly

385
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:12,510
This Kira is way stupid and different from the first Kira

386
00:30:12,909 --> 00:30:16,627
Besides, the first Kira doesn't kill innocent people

387
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:18,474
You're right

388
00:30:18,474 --> 00:30:21,712
If I were Kira, I'd get angry

389
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,500
This Kira tried to make us believe that he was outside the studio

390
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,500
Had the studio on surveillance

391
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,500
He could be hidden inside the studio

392
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,523
Check everyone in the studio

393
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:37,436
If the first Kira joins the second Kira

394
00:30:37,437 --> 00:30:39,844
It will be a huge threat

395
00:30:41,114 --> 00:30:43,013
We must prevent it. Mr Yagami..

396
00:30:43,048 --> 00:30:45,946
Is it possible to send Kira a message through TV?

397
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,914
What kind of message?

398
00:30:53,728 --> 00:30:56,514
Nishiyama Saeko is the No. 1 anchorwoman in Japan

399
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,299
Thank you so much

400
00:30:59,106 --> 00:31:01,946
That's clever... You're the man, Demegawa

401
00:31:03,741 --> 00:31:05,701
How can they be so blind?

402
00:31:07,071 --> 00:31:10,152
The Second Kira trusted and sent the tapes to us

403
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:13,986
because you've been reporting on the First Kira's activities

404
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:18,086
They should appreciate you

405
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,193
Irritating¡­

406
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:24,217
Why didn't you become an anchor?

407
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,638
See how Saeko behaves?

408
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:29,599
To be an anchor, you have to sell youself as a 'female'

409
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,400
I can't stand it

410
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,940
You're prettier than her

411
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,782
Give me a break

412
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,078
Demegawa!

413
00:31:39,645 --> 00:31:41,185
Did you survive the torture by the police?

414
00:31:41,842 --> 00:31:43,983
Yeah, and more than that

415
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,321
I got a sweet gift from them

416
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,180
What's that?

417
00:31:47,183 --> 00:31:49,551
That's a message from the police to the Second Kira

418
00:31:50,137 --> 00:31:51,295
We can expect high ratings

419
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:53,490
Great job!

420
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:56,955
This is a message for the Second Kira

421
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,500
Stop trying to approach the First Kira

422
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,470
It's not too late if you haven't met him

423
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,510
You must never get involved in Kira just because you're curious

424
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,510
You'll be used

425
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,510
and definitely killed by Kira

426
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:12,480
Yagami Light....

427
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,936
It's written "Moon"
but read "Light"

428
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,530
"...please provide us with any information regarding Kira"

429
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:25,530
"... save those living under Kira's terrorist acts"

430
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:27,562
"... and save the world"

431
00:32:28,409 --> 00:32:30,476
Reating the message...

432
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,510
Here is the data for every staff at Sakura TV

433
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:39,267
and the list of people who entered the studio that day

434
00:32:39,493 --> 00:32:40,811
What a huge amount

435
00:32:42,246 --> 00:32:43,382
That total...

436
00:32:44,011 --> 00:32:45,984
8000 people. approximately.

437
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,170
Let's start

438
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:06,480
Oh, good evening!

439
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:10,447
Nice to meet you, I'm Amane Misa

440
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,935
You're a friend of Sayu?

441
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,587
Oh, no

442
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,466
I was watching TV and... I thought you must be worried.

443
00:33:20,285 --> 00:33:22,451
I couldn't help come to see you

444
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:26,510
to show you this notebook

445
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,994
Here, touch it

446
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,817
Light, you're back!

447
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,520
She's my friend.

448
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,573
She'll come to my room for a while

449
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,576
Hello

450
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,099
Light, did you invite a friend?

451
00:33:57,362 --> 00:33:58,686
Nice to meet you

452
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,702
Her face looks familiar...

453
00:34:10,737 --> 00:34:14,006
She's Misa-misa! of the Happy Sweets!

454
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,905
Yeah! Amane Misa!

455
00:34:30,121 --> 00:34:31,282
How did you know it?

456
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:33,407
Ah, that's what I thought!

457
00:34:33,407 --> 00:34:35,852
You haven't done 'the deal'

458
00:34:36,431 --> 00:34:39,631
You know, you can see people's names and their lifespan

459
00:34:40,401 --> 00:34:43,229
but you can't see the lifespan of a person who has the notebook

460
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:48,182
I couldn't answer unless you ask me

461
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:54,673
Are you... working in the studio or something?

462
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:59,490
um... I... I think I'm kind of famous..

463
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,227
A singer?

464
00:35:05,227 --> 00:35:07,237
Oh, actually, this is my first CD.

465
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:10,550
I also appear on magazine and TV.

466
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,247
Oh, there's a new movie too

467
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:15,216
How did you find out where I live?

468
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,520
From the internet,

469
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,520
You gave a speech at the entrance ceremony of college

470
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:22,530
I found a photo of you there

471
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:25,530
If you were arrested,

472
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:26,919
Kira's secrets would come out!

473
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:29,530
I'm sorry!

474
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,540
But I haven't been arrested

475
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:35,267
and I won't be if I follow your orders from now on

476
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:36,920
Right?

477
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,386
I can find out L's name

478
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,550
I'll be your eyes. So...

479
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,490
So what?

480
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:54,543
Let me be your girlfriend

481
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,724
I can't

482
00:35:59,011 --> 00:36:00,172
Why not?

483
00:36:00,476 --> 00:36:02,744
There are your fingerprints on the tapes

484
00:36:03,213 --> 00:36:05,974
If the police take fingerprints directly from you,

485
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,966
they'll find out you're the Second Kira.

486
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,455
Those weren't mine!

487
00:36:11,301 --> 00:36:13,276
I'm not that stupid

488
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:16,550
I have a friend in Osaka who's into the occult

489
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,560
and I showed her fake pictures of ghosts

490
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,560
and asked her to send videos to TV stations together...

491
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,177
And what is she doing now?

492
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:28,476
If you want, I'll kill her right now

493
00:36:29,366 --> 00:36:32,376
No, The police'll easily link her to you

494
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:37,067
If you don't believe me...

495
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:41,038
You can keep my Death Note

496
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:44,550
I'm still the owner of the notebook even if you keep it.

497
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:47,550
So I can still work my eyes for you.

498
00:36:48,038 --> 00:36:49,434
Right Remu?

499
00:36:49,873 --> 00:36:51,556
Yes, you're right

500
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,042
Now, I can't kill you

501
00:36:58,408 --> 00:37:00,828
and you can kill me if you don't need me

502
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,529
I'm happy...

503
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:13,132
...even if you're just going to use me

504
00:37:15,374 --> 00:37:16,790
Trust me

505
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,305
Why are you doing this?

506
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,597
Misa lost all of her family members 3 years ago

507
00:37:28,597 --> 00:37:30,680
They were killed by a burglar

508
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:46,950
Since Misa had seen his face

509
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,855
The suspect was soon arrested

510
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,960
But Misa was the only witness so it wasn't enough to convict him

511
00:37:54,034 --> 00:37:57,682
Tamura Yoichi, the suspect was soon released

512
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:07,900
She was caught in a deep empty darkness in her mind

513
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:11,988
Everyone gave up on Misa's future

514
00:38:12,538 --> 00:38:14,465
But one day,

515
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:17,659
Something happened

516
00:38:22,724 --> 00:38:24,906
"Tamura Yoichi Found Dead"

517
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,218
"Is This Kira?"

518
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:34,009
Kira punished him

519
00:38:35,042 --> 00:38:38,593
Misa was grateful to the God named Kira

520
00:38:48,438 --> 00:38:49,307
Please

521
00:38:52,442 --> 00:38:54,614
Trust me

522
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:59,964
You are everything to me

523
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,767
But you killed innocent policemen

524
00:39:03,792 --> 00:39:07,305
Don't you think it's the same as the burglar who killed your family?

525
00:39:08,008 --> 00:39:10,305
Don't say such things to me?

526
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,950
You also think that..

527
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:18,402
...sacrifices for the good of all can't be helped

528
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,920
It was the only thing I could do

529
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:29,569
I really wanted to see you

530
00:39:38,503 --> 00:39:39,845
I understand

531
00:39:42,554 --> 00:39:44,245
For me...

532
00:39:44,979 --> 00:39:47,010
You shortened your own life...

533
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,408
Your eyes became my weapon

534
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:52,415
Thank you...

535
00:39:57,691 --> 00:39:59,353
I'll do my best

536
00:40:01,405 --> 00:40:03,375
to be loved by you..

537
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:18,906
I'll arrange a chance for you to see L.

538
00:40:19,095 --> 00:40:22,095
And you'll see L's real name

539
00:40:22,095 --> 00:40:24,008
Can you do it?

540
00:40:24,997 --> 00:40:27,874
You don't have to ask me, just say "do it"

541
00:40:28,168 --> 00:40:31,590
I'll do anything you want me to

542
00:40:31,957 --> 00:40:34,437
If one of us gets arrested

543
00:40:34,105 --> 00:40:37,115
we'll never talk about the other one and the Death Note

544
00:40:37,115 --> 00:40:39,322
Can you swear?

545
00:40:40,115 --> 00:40:41,854
Yes, I swear

546
00:40:42,115 --> 00:40:43,554
Good

547
00:40:47,125 --> 00:40:49,271
Then... It's my turn

548
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:54,539
We're gonna date at least once a week

549
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,088
You don't understand what I said

550
00:40:58,105 --> 00:41:00,105
But once L dies,

551
00:41:00,105 --> 00:41:01,871
There won't be no difficulty between us, right?

552
00:41:02,105 --> 00:41:04,515
You underestimate L

553
00:41:05,008 --> 00:41:06,524
Besides L is already...

554
00:41:07,115 --> 00:41:09,496
Suspecting that I am Kira

555
00:41:09,497 --> 00:41:10,497
What?

556
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,804
L is so smart

557
00:41:14,826 --> 00:41:18,670
Everybody says L hasn't figured out anything yet...

558
00:41:18,705 --> 00:41:22,064
Now I've reached a position where I can contact him directly,

559
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:24,705
L and Kira are getting closer...?

560
00:41:27,778 --> 00:41:29,391
I'm impressed by both!

561
00:41:29,392 --> 00:41:30,787
It's so exciting

562
00:41:31,105 --> 00:41:33,263
And of course, I need you to kill L.

563
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:35,733
So I wanted to contact you as quickly as possible

564
00:41:35,733 --> 00:41:38,501
If so, why just can't we date?

565
00:41:38,536 --> 00:41:40,115
If you want to date once a week

566
00:41:40,115 --> 00:41:44,115
I'll have to date other girls

567
00:41:44,115 --> 00:41:46,125
to avoid being suspected that we have a special relationship

568
00:41:46,125 --> 00:41:48,085
You can't do that

569
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:51,125
If I see you dating other girl..

570
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:53,624
I'll kill her!

571
00:41:54,135 --> 00:41:56,558
I'm the only one who'll date you!

572
00:41:57,135 --> 00:41:59,649
If you don't obey me, I have to kill you

573
00:42:02,105 --> 00:42:04,105
I won't let you kill her, Yagami Light!

574
00:42:06,115 --> 00:42:08,115
If you harm this girl,

575
00:42:08,115 --> 00:42:09,937
I won't forgive you

576
00:42:10,507 --> 00:42:12,753
I see her lifespan

577
00:42:13,623 --> 00:42:17,050
If she dies, I'll think it's because you killed her. I'll have to kill you

578
00:42:17,125 --> 00:42:20,070
If I find you trying to kill her..

579
00:42:20,125 --> 00:42:23,150
I'll kill you before that happens

580
00:42:41,115 --> 00:42:42,473
Ryuzaki...?

581
00:42:44,115 --> 00:42:47,734
Since that, there's no new action by the Second Kira

582
00:42:48,189 --> 00:42:52,971
I'm afriad the FIrst and the Second Kira have made contact already

583
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,299
Isn't it careless to expose your face?

584
00:42:56,334 --> 00:42:59,222
Yes, it's dangerous if you're Kira

585
00:42:59,765 --> 00:43:03,796
You're the only one outside who knows that I'm L, so

586
00:43:04,888 --> 00:43:08,541
If you told the Second Kira about me, it's "the end." To avoid it,

587
00:43:09,115 --> 00:43:11,085
I brought this

588
00:43:13,756 --> 00:43:14,922
That'll work

589
00:43:17,125 --> 00:43:18,605
Did you come to watch over me?

590
00:43:19,125 --> 00:43:21,726
You think Kira is a college student. don't you?

591
00:43:22,125 --> 00:43:25,135
I have an important job here

592
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:26,427
About Kira?

593
00:43:28,582 --> 00:43:30,552
Light

594
00:43:33,145 --> 00:43:35,368
I had a recording nearby so I came to see you

595
00:43:35,368 --> 00:43:36,215
Here I am

596
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:39,014
You

597
00:43:45,298 --> 00:43:46,340
Oh?

598
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:49,278
Are you Light's friend?

599
00:43:49,982 --> 00:43:50,667
Yeah

600
00:43:53,135 --> 00:43:55,079
His name is Ryuzaki

601
00:43:57,135 --> 00:43:59,880
Why're you wearing such as stupid mask?

602
00:44:00,135 --> 00:44:02,528
Why don't you take it off?

603
00:44:05,145 --> 00:44:06,088
Hi there!

604
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,893
Are you... Ryuzaki...?

605
00:44:18,194 --> 00:44:20,614
Nice to meet you.
I'm Amane Misa

606
00:44:22,125 --> 00:44:25,420
Um... Light?
Your friend is a little weird

607
00:44:26,135 --> 00:44:27,615
He's just shy

608
00:44:32,145 --> 00:44:33,868
I envy you Light

609
00:44:38,145 --> 00:44:39,831
I listen to your Heaven's Door!

610
00:44:40,145 --> 00:44:42,897
Really?
I'm so glad!

611
00:44:43,782 --> 00:44:47,712
Light, why can you date with such a cute pop star?

612
00:44:48,125 --> 00:44:50,233
I approached him first

613
00:44:50,268 --> 00:44:51,698
Misa!

614
00:44:51,699 --> 00:44:53,471
Look, isn't that Misa-Misa?

615
00:44:55,135 --> 00:44:56,602
She really is!

616
00:44:58,135 --> 00:45:00,105
Why! Why is she here?

617
00:45:02,145 --> 00:45:04,145
This is great

618
00:45:04,145 --> 00:45:06,115
It's real

619
00:45:10,818 --> 00:45:14,849
You're the most intelligent students in Japan, right?

620
00:45:14,884 --> 00:45:16,303
Please shake hands with me

621
00:45:18,516 --> 00:45:21,240
Oh! Someone touched my bottom!

622
00:45:22,135 --> 00:45:23,593
Can't forgive him!

623
00:45:24,583 --> 00:45:27,451
I, the greatest detective, will definitely catch the pervert!

624
00:45:28,135 --> 00:45:28,936
Here you go

625
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:32,323
Ryuzaki, you're funny

626
00:45:32,333 --> 00:45:35,333
Then, don't you want to date with me?

627
00:45:36,145 --> 00:45:38,837
Too bad, here's my only sweet heart

628
00:45:39,446 --> 00:45:40,782
Whaaat?

629
00:45:41,297 --> 00:45:43,547
I have a class, so go back to your work

630
00:45:43,968 --> 00:45:44,793
Right

631
00:45:45,155 --> 00:45:47,727
Sorry, but I'm glad to see you

632
00:45:48,155 --> 00:45:49,563
See you soon, Light

633
00:45:58,135 --> 00:46:00,135
It's good...

634
00:46:00,135 --> 00:46:02,105
She's so cute

635
00:46:06,145 --> 00:46:07,434
Ryuzaki

636
00:46:08,145 --> 00:46:09,796
She's my girlfriend

637
00:46:10,869 --> 00:46:11,749
bye

638
00:46:12,594 --> 00:46:14,109
It was lucky to see Misa-Misa.

639
00:46:13,155 --> 00:46:15,125
I'll go back to the office

640
00:46:17,155 --> 00:46:17,988
Take care

641
00:46:25,135 --> 00:46:26,094
I won...!

642
00:46:30,276 --> 00:46:32,648
"Misa"

643
00:46:47,155 --> 00:46:48,241
Hello

644
00:46:53,165 --> 00:46:55,575
What are you doing?

645
00:46:59,135 --> 00:47:03,095
Someone dropped this cell phone and I picked it up

646
00:47:04,145 --> 00:47:05,726
It belongs to Misa

647
00:47:06,844 --> 00:47:08,166
Give it to me

648
00:47:20,165 --> 00:47:23,050
Calling her just after you said goodbye?

649
00:47:23,584 --> 00:47:25,649
You really are in love with her
Or,

650
00:47:26,231 --> 00:47:29,229
Was there anything you had to ask her immediately

651
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:38,998
Hello

652
00:47:39,251 --> 00:47:40,867
We have the target.

653
00:47:41,907 --> 00:47:43,907
It wasn't the place we expected

654
00:47:44,155 --> 00:47:45,571
since she moved around so much

655
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:48,594
We'll send her to the office

656
00:47:48,797 --> 00:47:51,789
I got it
Thank you for the hard work

657
00:47:54,165 --> 00:47:55,276
Just now

658
00:47:55,277 --> 00:47:59,286
We arrested Amane Misa for the suspicion to be the Second Kira

659
00:48:00,175 --> 00:48:01,138
What?

660
00:48:04,064 --> 00:48:08,595
She is an enthusiastic supporter of Kira and she was in the studio that day

661
00:48:09,563 --> 00:48:11,088
From her room,

662
00:48:10,155 --> 00:48:13,155
We found material evidences such as a cosmetic powder

663
00:48:13,155 --> 00:48:16,155
and fibers matching her clothes

664
00:48:16,681 --> 00:48:20,038
We're not going to announce so please cooperate for awhile

665
00:48:21,268 --> 00:48:24,310
You have to stay away from the office

666
00:48:25,165 --> 00:48:26,548
What are you going to do to her?

667
00:48:26,952 --> 00:48:30,948
I can't tell you.
Can I take her phone too?

668
00:48:33,687 --> 00:48:35,451
I can't believe she's the Kira

669
00:48:37,185 --> 00:48:37,379
It can't be

670
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,101
Awwww, Light

671
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:48,028
The goddess of the luck is gone

672
00:48:49,598 --> 00:48:50,727
See you

673
00:49:38,185 --> 00:49:38,865
Ryuzaki

674
00:49:40,285 --> 00:49:42,932
Do we really have to do this?

675
00:49:43,698 --> 00:49:46,131
Second Kira can kill by seeing the face

676
00:49:46,131 --> 00:49:50,080
It's reasonable to restrain her with a 24 hour surveillance

677
00:49:51,276 --> 00:49:54,276
If she isn't Kira...

678
00:49:53,165 --> 00:49:55,818
This will violate human rights

679
00:49:56,339 --> 00:49:57,702
We've got the evidence!

680
00:49:58,175 --> 00:50:01,175
Besides she stays silent even in this situation

681
00:50:01,175 --> 00:50:04,175
If she's innocent, why doesn't she just say so

682
00:50:05,744 --> 00:50:07,744
Tell her agent to announce

683
00:50:06,185 --> 00:50:09,667
that she's in hospital

684
00:50:10,357 --> 00:50:11,779
It's already done

685
00:50:13,342 --> 00:50:14,324
Mr. Yagami

686
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:18,564
Amane and Light have a close relationship

687
00:50:20,223 --> 00:50:20,925
What?

688
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:25,565
She's even visited your home, Mr. Yagami

689
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:27,826
Light...

690
00:50:32,233 --> 00:50:34,233
I have to contact Rem

691
00:50:36,729 --> 00:50:36,729
before Misa talks them about the secrets...

692
00:50:37,233 --> 00:50:39,186
It's gonna get worse

693
00:50:39,673 --> 00:50:43,633
We can't part from the owner of the Death Note

694
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:49,506
Unless the owner abandons the right of possession or...

695
00:50:50,155 --> 00:50:51,801
dies

696
00:51:08,243 --> 00:51:11,889
She hasn't eaten anything in 2 days

697
00:51:13,068 --> 00:51:15,594
She has a lot of guts..
She doesn't even complain

698
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:19,241
I'm... becoming a fan of her

699
00:51:21,253 --> 00:51:21,889
I'm going to buy her CD

700
00:51:22,404 --> 00:51:23,224
Idiot!

701
00:51:24,882 --> 00:51:26,378
Toilet...

702
00:51:27,646 --> 00:51:29,503
I want to use the toilet

703
00:51:36,502 --> 00:51:37,422
Even after she got caught,

704
00:51:37,423 --> 00:51:39,804
Kira hasn't stopped punishing

705
00:51:44,916 --> 00:51:45,658
Here

706
00:51:48,926 --> 00:51:50,250
Misa

707
00:51:53,426 --> 00:51:55,436
Please...

708
00:51:55,436 --> 00:51:57,396
Say something...

709
00:51:59,406 --> 00:52:01,066
We don't want to..

710
00:52:01,067 --> 00:52:03,753
make you suffer anymore

711
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:08,599
What do you...

712
00:52:09,413 --> 00:52:11,262
know about Kira?

713
00:52:14,416 --> 00:52:16,006
I can't stand this anymore

714
00:52:16,426 --> 00:52:17,947
kill me

715
00:52:19,426 --> 00:52:21,254
kill me

716
00:52:23,426 --> 00:52:25,367
We must release her!

717
00:52:26,436 --> 00:52:28,661
Amane Misa, do you hear me?

718
00:52:29,436 --> 00:52:31,406
Please

719
00:52:32,406 --> 00:52:34,376
kill me

720
00:52:38,416 --> 00:52:41,789
Do you mean that you admit you're the Second Kira?

721
00:52:42,299 --> 00:52:44,501
It doesn't matter if I'm Kira or not

722
00:52:46,426 --> 00:52:48,888
If I have to live like this...

723
00:52:51,925 --> 00:52:53,475
I'd rather die

724
00:52:57,805 --> 00:52:58,371
Hey!

725
00:53:00,791 --> 00:53:02,539
kill me now

726
00:53:05,339 --> 00:53:08,129
You're able to kill me easily!

727
00:53:11,477 --> 00:53:15,334
I should have died that time anyway

728
00:53:18,426 --> 00:53:20,719
I'm happy even if I die now

729
00:53:24,021 --> 00:53:26,808
kill me before I get old and lose my beauty

730
00:53:29,436 --> 00:53:31,406
kill me right now

731
00:53:46,426 --> 00:53:48,426
Rem..

732
00:53:48,426 --> 00:53:51,994
Misa abandoned the possessive right of the Death Note

733
00:53:53,936 --> 00:53:56,984
She asked me to kill her

734
00:53:57,654 --> 00:53:59,722
because she didn't want you to get in trouble

735
00:53:59,757 --> 00:54:02,427
Do you understand, Yagami Light?

736
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:05,988
Everything she did was to be loved by you

737
00:54:07,416 --> 00:54:08,354
Did she...

738
00:54:09,933 --> 00:54:13,140
lose all the memory about the Death Note?

739
00:54:13,331 --> 00:54:14,407
Of course

740
00:54:14,765 --> 00:54:16,749
She forgot that she has killed people

741
00:54:16,426 --> 00:54:19,791
or that you are Kira

742
00:54:21,123 --> 00:54:23,500
I told her that she'd never see me anymore

743
00:54:23,535 --> 00:54:28,668
and all she'd remember is that she loves Yagami Light

744
00:54:29,486 --> 00:54:32,563
Misa answered it would be fine

745
00:54:37,446 --> 00:54:40,108
Save her at all cost!

746
00:54:40,446 --> 00:54:43,369
If you don't, I'll kill you

747
00:54:44,456 --> 00:54:47,040
With a Death God being so nice to her..

748
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:49,661
Misa must be very happy

749
00:54:49,696 --> 00:54:53,869
I am just trying to keep the promise with Jealous

750
00:54:56,436 --> 00:54:57,905
Jealous£¿

751
00:54:58,436 --> 00:55:02,233
Jealous was always looking down on Misa

752
00:55:02,436 --> 00:55:07,377
He had a father-like sympathy towards the girl who lost her parents

753
00:55:08,144 --> 00:55:12,126
However, when the time comes when Misa would die

754
00:55:13,564 --> 00:55:17,887
Eventually, he broke the rules of the Death Gods

755
00:55:18,426 --> 00:55:21,426
He wrote the name of the man

756
00:55:21,426 --> 00:55:25,040
and extended Misa's lifespan

757
00:55:25,436 --> 00:55:30,890
The Death Gods exist only to take lives of humans

758
00:55:31,436 --> 00:55:33,446
It's a serious taboo to save a human

759
00:55:33,446 --> 00:55:36,624
and extend her lifespan

760
00:55:37,446 --> 00:55:40,050
Jealous fell to pieces and died

761
00:55:41,197 --> 00:55:44,308
asking me to take care of her

762
00:55:44,770 --> 00:55:45,870
Therefore

763
00:55:46,459 --> 00:55:48,828
Jealous's Death Note was given to Misa

764
00:55:50,466 --> 00:55:54,396
A Death God who falls in love with a human shall die...

765
00:55:58,436 --> 00:56:00,436
a great story, indeed

766
00:56:01,459 --> 00:56:03,469
If you won't save Misa,

767
00:56:02,446 --> 00:56:04,406
I will kill you

768
00:56:05,446 --> 00:56:08,434
Don't give me the same phrase over and over again, Rem

769
00:56:09,207 --> 00:56:11,467
Imagine how she feels if I die

770
00:56:12,954 --> 00:56:14,817
She'll definitely kill herself

771
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:18,525
Can't you even imagine that?

772
00:56:23,294 --> 00:56:24,666
There's a way

773
00:56:28,049 --> 00:56:29,893
It needs a lot of work though..

774
00:56:35,446 --> 00:56:37,516
Are you really sure that it will save Misa

775
00:56:37,551 --> 00:56:40,264
if only I follow your direction

776
00:56:40,446 --> 00:56:42,387
Can't you trust me even a little?

777
00:56:42,387 --> 00:56:45,848
He's smarter than you think

778
00:56:46,456 --> 00:56:48,639
Ok, I trust you

779
00:56:49,456 --> 00:56:50,872
Yagami Light

780
00:56:51,484 --> 00:56:53,131
I leave Misa to you

781
00:57:01,436 --> 00:57:04,214
What are you doing with my Death Note?

782
00:57:04,612 --> 00:57:06,139
I'm just hiding it

783
00:57:07,055 --> 00:57:10,729
When I discard its possession, I'll say...

784
00:57:12,267 --> 00:57:13,593
"I discard it"

785
00:57:15,450 --> 00:57:18,128
"I discard it"...
hum....

786
00:57:20,466 --> 00:57:22,466
Hey stalker

787
00:57:22,466 --> 00:57:24,466
If you quit now,

788
00:57:24,466 --> 00:57:26,549
I won't accuse you!

789
00:57:28,214 --> 00:57:31,290
I'll give you my autograph and a kiss!

790
00:57:33,136 --> 00:57:35,136
Oh please!

791
00:57:34,446 --> 00:57:36,446
Let me out of here!

792
00:57:37,602 --> 00:57:39,231
What happened to her during the blackout

793
00:57:39,231 --> 00:57:40,231
She kept repeating..

794
00:57:42,776 --> 00:57:45,323
We are not stalkers.

795
00:57:45,323 --> 00:57:46,295
We are the police

796
00:57:47,118 --> 00:57:50,128
The police can't do such a thing!

797
00:57:50,128 --> 00:57:53,128
Pop stars are wiser than you think!

798
00:57:53,128 --> 00:57:55,128
If you think we are stalkers,

799
00:57:55,128 --> 00:57:57,128
why did you keep silent?

800
00:57:57,128 --> 00:57:59,057
I don't know!

801
00:57:59,138 --> 00:58:01,138
You suddenly caught me

802
00:58:01,138 --> 00:58:04,138
when I was just going to have lunch with Light

803
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:07,149
Do you admit the relationship between Yagmai Light?

804
00:58:07,184 --> 00:58:08,108
Of course...

805
00:58:08,108 --> 00:58:10,183
Of course I do. He's my boyfriend.

806
00:58:11,787 --> 00:58:13,832
Is she really the same person?

807
00:58:14,598 --> 00:58:16,750
Then how, did you and Light know each other?

808
00:58:16,785 --> 00:58:20,272
I fell in love with him at first sight at Sakura TV station

809
00:58:20,783 --> 00:58:23,417
I found his address and went to his home

810
00:58:25,171 --> 00:58:26,302
Anything wrong?

811
00:58:28,973 --> 00:58:30,859
You know how she acted before

812
00:58:31,712 --> 00:58:34,241
Now she frankly admitted about Light

813
00:58:34,951 --> 00:58:35,956
I'm confused

814
00:58:44,477 --> 00:58:46,946
Who said that we can't bring cellphones into the office?

815
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:47,777
ya..

816
00:58:48,512 --> 00:58:49,425
Hello

817
00:58:51,614 --> 00:58:53,403
I got it, please come in

818
00:58:54,913 --> 00:58:58,626
Keep recording and shut down the screen

819
00:58:58,661 --> 00:58:59,098
Yes

820
00:59:04,094 --> 00:59:06,064
Is someone coming?

821
00:59:08,148 --> 00:59:10,216
Light!

822
00:59:13,026 --> 00:59:14,965
I've told Ryuzaki but...

823
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:18,595
As L said, I might be the Kira

824
00:59:19,270 --> 00:59:20,997
What on earth are you talking about?

825
00:59:22,128 --> 00:59:24,020
I've been thinking that..

826
00:59:25,073 --> 00:59:28,234
It may be better if people who committed serious crimes die

827
00:59:29,079 --> 00:59:30,369
So it's possible that I may become Kira

828
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:33,175
You're not the only one who thinks so!

829
00:59:33,289 --> 00:59:34,812
Are you trying to cover Misa?

830
00:59:35,824 --> 00:59:40,454
I don't know much about her yet since we've just started dating

831
00:59:40,828 --> 00:59:42,824
I can't believe that she's Kira

832
00:59:43,656 --> 00:59:45,576
Of course, I'm not conscious of Kira in me

833
00:59:45,577 --> 00:59:46,913
but,

834
00:59:47,711 --> 00:59:49,765
I might have a multiple personality

835
00:59:50,909 --> 00:59:52,135
I want you to figure it out

836
00:59:52,136 --> 00:59:54,564
We investigated you, but couldn't find anything suspicious

837
00:59:55,147 --> 00:59:57,465
But we watched over him only when he was home

838
00:59:57,986 --> 01:00:00,674
We don't know exactly what he did outside

839
01:00:01,272 --> 01:00:04,945
Then tie his arms and legs and keep him under surveillance

840
01:00:04,945 --> 01:00:05,857
This time

841
01:00:07,594 --> 01:00:09,871
It's an around-the-clock surveillance

842
01:00:11,241 --> 01:00:12,855
That'll be fine with me

843
01:00:13,887 --> 01:00:15,443
But if,

844
01:00:15,934 --> 01:00:18,973
new crimes are committed while I'm under surveillance...

845
01:00:19,411 --> 01:00:21,311
and Kira punishes the criminals

846
01:00:22,157 --> 01:00:23,273
When it happens

847
01:00:23,936 --> 01:00:26,075
We'll certainly free you

848
01:00:29,034 --> 01:00:29,877
Thank you

849
01:00:38,354 --> 01:00:38,960
Light...

850
01:00:40,555 --> 01:00:41,671
Do you really mean it?
