00:00:53,143 --> 00:00:56,345
Sweet.

00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,694
Here ya go.

5
00:01:12,696 --> 00:01:16,031
I ordered
the pan-fried noodles.

6
00:01:18,769 --> 00:01:21,069
And I brought you...Soup!

7
00:01:22,406 --> 00:01:23,906
I can't get anything right.

8
00:01:23,908 --> 00:01:25,607
Everything I touch
turns to garbage.

9
00:01:25,609 --> 00:01:27,442
I'm useless and I'm worthless

10
00:01:27,444 --> 00:01:29,778
and my personal grooming
is mediocre at best.

11
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,014
Oh!

12
00:01:32,016 --> 00:01:33,549
I-I'm sorry.

13
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:36,285
He's been like this
ever since...

14
00:01:36,287 --> 00:01:37,819
Well, you know...

15
00:01:37,821 --> 00:01:38,820
Of course.

16
00:01:38,822 --> 00:01:41,323
How are the others doing?

17
00:01:41,325 --> 00:01:43,559
You mean
the formerly Furious Five?

18
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:47,195
Come on, it's my birthday!

19
00:01:47,197 --> 00:01:48,363
Tigress, come on.

20
00:01:48,365 --> 00:01:50,399
The kids.

21
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:51,800
You cannot defeat me

22
00:01:51,802 --> 00:01:55,304
and my magical talking carrot.

23
00:01:55,306 --> 00:01:56,672
I'm sassy.

24
00:01:56,674 --> 00:01:58,206
Kids, cake!

25
00:02:00,978 --> 00:02:02,744
Birthday parties?

26
00:02:02,746 --> 00:02:03,845
And Shifu,

27
00:02:03,847 --> 00:02:06,548
no one's seen Shifu
for a while now.

28
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,883
Oh, very sad.

29
00:02:07,885 --> 00:02:10,953
So if you could be
just a little sensitive

30
00:02:10,955 --> 00:02:12,854
to my son's situation...

31
00:02:12,856 --> 00:02:14,656
Of course.

32
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,795
No wonder you're not
a Dragon Warrior anymore!

33
00:02:22,766 --> 00:02:26,635
Get out and don't come back!

34
00:02:26,637 --> 00:02:29,171
Until after lunch.
Here's a coupon.

35
00:02:31,975 --> 00:02:33,942
You were the Dragon Warrior,

36
00:02:33,944 --> 00:02:36,445
You had everything
you ever wanted...

37
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,180
And you blew it.

38
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,986
Begin.

39
00:02:57,267 --> 00:02:59,001
Well-done.

40
00:02:59,003 --> 00:03:00,402
Excellent. When you--

41
00:03:00,404 --> 00:03:02,537
And now, the spin!
What?

42
00:03:04,842 --> 00:03:06,174
Po!

43
00:03:06,176 --> 00:03:07,376
- Po!
- Po?

44
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:10,078
Po!

45
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,413
Not what I--

46
00:03:11,415 --> 00:03:14,716
Po, the pyramid of fortitude
is a traditional pose,

47
00:03:14,718 --> 00:03:17,019
representing stability
and unity.

48
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:18,720
It does not spin.

49
00:03:18,722 --> 00:03:21,156
Yeah, but it looks
so cool if I--

50
00:03:21,158 --> 00:03:22,424
I don't care.

51
00:03:22,426 --> 00:03:23,825
The presentation
of the seven forms

52
00:03:23,827 --> 00:03:27,029
must be done in
the traditional way.

53
00:03:27,031 --> 00:03:28,196
This is important, Po.

54
00:03:28,198 --> 00:03:30,999
The masters
of the sacred onyx shaolin

55
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:33,735
are coming to inspect
the jade palace.

56
00:03:33,737 --> 00:03:38,006
I trained with both master Chao
and master Jungjie under Oogway.

57
00:03:38,008 --> 00:03:40,575
Chao and Jungjie
are coming here?

58
00:03:40,577 --> 00:03:42,811
Two of the greatest
kung fu masters of all time!

59
00:03:44,248 --> 00:03:47,883
How well you perform the
presentation of the seven forms

60
00:03:47,885 --> 00:03:50,686
will be a reflection
of my abilities as a teacher.

61
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,354
I need to make
a good impression.

62
00:03:52,356 --> 00:03:55,257
So please, nobody
do anything embarrassing,

63
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:57,526
Stupid, or dangerous.

64
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:00,362
Yeah, you guys.
Be cool.

65
00:04:00,364 --> 00:04:02,230
I mean you, Po.

66
00:04:02,232 --> 00:04:03,832
Don't ask for autographs,

67
00:04:03,834 --> 00:04:05,967
don't tell long stories,

68
00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:08,704
don't offer to show
any of your collections...

69
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,205
don't be Po.

70
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,712
And who should he be?

71
00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:21,183
Oh, my gosh, Chao and Jungjie!

72
00:04:21,185 --> 00:04:22,217
Can I have your autographs?

73
00:04:22,219 --> 00:04:23,652
Can I tell you long stories?

74
00:04:23,654 --> 00:04:26,354
Can I show you my collection
of beets shaped like turnips?

75
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,592
Master Chao, master Jungjie,

76
00:04:30,594 --> 00:04:32,327
Please excuse Po.

77
00:04:32,329 --> 00:04:34,463
He's a little... excitable.

78
00:04:34,465 --> 00:04:37,399
You are the Dragon Warrior?

79
00:04:37,401 --> 00:04:40,368
Yes, and you are
master Jungjie!

80
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,270
I'm so excited I could pee.

81
00:04:42,272 --> 00:04:43,338
Panda!

82
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,874
Hm.
You've maintained exactly

83
00:04:45,876 --> 00:04:49,111
The level of discipline I would
have expected from you.

84
00:04:49,113 --> 00:04:51,079
You can thank me later.

85
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:56,918
And now, the masters'
ceremonial sparring.

86
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,820
Everyone,
back to your quarters.

87
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:04,526
"Ceremonial sparring"?

88
00:05:04,528 --> 00:05:06,228
It's ancient, it's secret,

89
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,362
And I wanna watch!

90
00:05:07,364 --> 00:05:09,231
Really bad.
Really, really bad.

91
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:10,298
Really, really,
really, really--

92
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,433
Panda!

93
00:05:11,435 --> 00:05:12,501
This is private.

94
00:05:12,503 --> 00:05:14,903
Your novice eyes
are not ready to see it.

95
00:05:14,905 --> 00:05:16,304
It's too dangerous.

96
00:05:16,306 --> 00:05:19,474
<i>Ancient, secret
and dangerous?</i>

97
00:05:19,476 --> 00:05:21,443
Oh, it's like
you poured awesome sauce

98
00:05:21,445 --> 00:05:23,979
all over
a big plate of bodacious!

99
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:37,125
Oh, don't listen to Shifu.

100
00:05:37,127 --> 00:05:38,593
He's always been
a stick in the mud.

101
00:05:38,595 --> 00:05:41,029
You are the Dragon Warrior,
my friend.

102
00:05:41,031 --> 00:05:44,566
You should see us sparring.

103
00:05:44,568 --> 00:05:46,535
But Shifu said I wasn't ready.

104
00:05:46,537 --> 00:05:47,969
I'll tell you what.

105
00:05:47,971 --> 00:05:51,173
I'll leave that door open
a little so you can peek in.

106
00:05:51,175 --> 00:05:53,608
Awesome!

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,768
So... awesome.

108
00:06:46,463 --> 00:06:48,363
Cool!

109
00:06:48,365 --> 00:06:49,698
Jungjie...

110
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,033
We are sparring, not fighting.

111
00:06:52,035 --> 00:06:54,302
Shifu is not your enemy.

112
00:06:54,304 --> 00:06:55,637
It's all right.

113
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:58,206
I was just a little slow.

114
00:07:00,176 --> 00:07:02,377
Everyone's a little
slow sometimes,

115
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:04,446
Right, Jungjie?

116
00:07:09,385 --> 00:07:11,353
So much anger.

117
00:07:11,355 --> 00:07:14,890
This is why oogway didn't
pick you to run the jade palace.

118
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,062
Jungjie?

119
00:07:21,064 --> 00:07:24,566
Golden lotus clap!

120
00:07:24,568 --> 00:07:26,868
Don't look!

121
00:07:41,884 --> 00:07:44,219
I-I'm blind!

122
00:07:44,221 --> 00:07:46,421
In my eyes!

123
00:07:48,944 --> 00:07:49,944
I'm blind.

124
00:07:49,946 --> 00:07:51,412
Can't see.

125
00:07:51,414 --> 00:07:53,147
I'm blind--I don't--
all right.

126
00:07:55,085 --> 00:07:56,551
Okay, I can do this.

127
00:07:56,553 --> 00:07:59,320
Just gotta, you know...
Get to know my surroundings.

128
00:08:00,657 --> 00:08:01,723
Right.

129
00:08:01,725 --> 00:08:02,924
That's the tree again.

130
00:08:02,926 --> 00:08:05,493
All right...

131
00:08:06,963 --> 00:08:10,298
All right, who keeps
moving the tree?

132
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,968
Ah, all clear.

133
00:08:16,206 --> 00:08:19,874
Jungjie, the golden lotus clap
is too dangerous.

134
00:08:19,876 --> 00:08:22,644
You are right as always,
master Chao.

135
00:08:22,646 --> 00:08:25,480
I stand in awe
of your prudence and sagacity.

136
00:08:25,482 --> 00:08:27,282
We are done here.

137
00:08:27,284 --> 00:08:30,952
It's time for the presentation
of the seven forms.

138
00:08:31,955 --> 00:08:35,823
Shifu, bring them in.

139
00:08:35,825 --> 00:08:39,327
It is time.

140
00:08:41,898 --> 00:08:43,131
What are you doing
down there?

141
00:08:43,133 --> 00:08:44,332
Come on.

142
00:08:44,334 --> 00:08:46,801
Wait!
I have a little problem.

143
00:08:46,803 --> 00:08:48,970
And I have a little
"I don't care."

144
00:08:52,775 --> 00:08:55,710
I trust you will be impressed.

145
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,250
Begin.

146
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,000
Po, now.

147
00:09:19,002 --> 00:09:20,835
What, who?

148
00:09:20,837 --> 00:09:22,103
Okay.

149
00:09:22,105 --> 00:09:24,272
And a-one-y, and a-two-y...

150
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:35,817
Po, no!

151
00:09:44,194 --> 00:09:45,994
Ta-da!

152
00:09:50,499 --> 00:09:53,701
He must have disobeyed you
and watched us spar.

153
00:09:53,703 --> 00:09:56,671
Shifu, fix him.

154
00:09:56,673 --> 00:09:58,439
Golden lotus clap!

155
00:10:04,814 --> 00:10:05,880
I can see!

156
00:10:05,882 --> 00:10:09,984
I can see... angry, angry faces

157
00:10:09,986 --> 00:10:11,686
pointed at me.

158
00:10:11,688 --> 00:10:15,323
Shifu, shaolin is built
on discipline,

159
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:16,991
honor, and tradition.

160
00:10:16,993 --> 00:10:19,394
Here I see none of that.

161
00:10:19,396 --> 00:10:21,062
It's not Shifu's fault.

162
00:10:21,064 --> 00:10:22,897
See, I was watching
you guys sparring and--

163
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:26,200
If you disobeyed Shifu,
it is his fault.

164
00:10:26,202 --> 00:10:29,904
It means he is unable
to maintain discipline.

165
00:10:29,906 --> 00:10:32,473
What do you have
to say for yourself?

166
00:10:32,475 --> 00:10:35,443
I...

167
00:10:35,445 --> 00:10:37,745
Nothing.

168
00:10:37,747 --> 00:10:39,747
I am sorry.

169
00:10:43,419 --> 00:10:46,688
As hierarch
of the sacred onyx council,

170
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,189
I hereby declare

171
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:53,227
that Shifu is no longer
the master of the jade palace.

172
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:57,899
What?

173
00:10:57,901 --> 00:10:59,467
You can't do that!

174
00:10:59,469 --> 00:11:02,503
Silence! You dare address
the most venerable master Chao

175
00:11:02,505 --> 00:11:04,038
with such disrespect?

176
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,174
Haven't I taught you anything?

177
00:11:09,178 --> 00:11:11,646
No, I haven't.

178
00:11:11,648 --> 00:11:13,314
Master Chao is right,

179
00:11:13,316 --> 00:11:14,716
and I accept his judgment.

180
00:11:14,718 --> 00:11:16,484
No!
It's not true, master Shifu--

181
00:11:16,486 --> 00:11:17,518
It can't be!

182
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,953
As will you.

183
00:11:18,955 --> 00:11:22,056
Now, do as master Chao
and master Jungjie command you.

184
00:11:22,058 --> 00:11:24,358
Do not disgrace me...

185
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,229
any more than
I have disgraced myself.

186
00:11:35,705 --> 00:11:37,939
Shifu is gone.

187
00:11:37,941 --> 00:11:42,076
I am placing the jade palace
in the hands of master Jungjie.

188
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:45,646
Uh, but--
Po...

189
00:11:45,648 --> 00:11:50,451
I expect you to return
the palace to its former glory.

190
00:11:50,453 --> 00:11:52,854
I'll return it
to even greater glory,

191
00:11:52,856 --> 00:11:55,356
As befits you, master Chao.

192
00:11:55,358 --> 00:11:58,559
Henceforth,
you are bound by honor

193
00:11:58,561 --> 00:11:59,794
to obey master Jungjie.

194
00:12:00,964 --> 00:12:03,765
I'll be back
to check on your progress.

195
00:12:03,767 --> 00:12:07,668
Good day to you all.

196
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:10,471
Uh, so, what should we do now?

197
00:12:10,473 --> 00:12:12,073
Get out!

198
00:12:12,075 --> 00:12:13,007
What?

199
00:12:15,395 --> 00:12:17,930
Get out!
What?

200
00:12:21,635 --> 00:12:24,303
Your services
are no longer required.

201
00:12:24,305 --> 00:12:29,275
Meet the new Furious Five.

202
00:12:29,277 --> 00:12:32,144
Tigress...

203
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,850
Let me know if you need
a letter of recommendation.

204
00:12:42,356 --> 00:12:45,324
Come on, guys, we can take 'em
if we all work together.

205
00:12:45,326 --> 00:12:47,459
Didn't you hear
what Shifu said?

206
00:12:47,461 --> 00:12:50,129
He told us to obey master Jungjie.

207
00:12:50,131 --> 00:12:51,797
He's in charge now.

208
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:52,932
If we fight him, it's like

209
00:12:52,934 --> 00:12:55,000
we're fighting against
the jade palace.

210
00:12:55,002 --> 00:12:57,503
It would be
the ultimate dishonor.

211
00:12:57,505 --> 00:12:59,471
We'd be left with nothing.

212
00:12:59,473 --> 00:13:01,807
But what are we left with now?

213
00:13:01,809 --> 00:13:03,642
We have our dignity.

214
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,983
You did this, Po.

215
00:13:10,985 --> 00:13:12,718
You disobeyed Shifu
and destroyed

216
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,522
what we've all devoted
our lives to building.

217
00:13:16,524 --> 00:13:18,123
We're through with you.

218
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:20,192
But...I'm sorry.

219
00:13:20,194 --> 00:13:22,494
Nice.

220
00:13:22,496 --> 00:13:24,797
I'm sorry.

221
00:13:26,367 --> 00:13:28,200
Po? Po!

222
00:13:28,202 --> 00:13:30,202
I need you to make a delivery

223
00:13:30,204 --> 00:13:32,338
to the jade palace.

224
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,006
Won't that be fun?

225
00:13:45,186 --> 00:13:46,619
Very nice.

226
00:13:46,621 --> 00:13:49,021
Really captures my essence.

227
00:13:49,023 --> 00:13:50,956
So the tapestry
is approved then?

228
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,057
Yes.

229
00:13:52,059 --> 00:13:53,492
And the statue?

230
00:13:53,494 --> 00:13:54,526
Yes.

231
00:13:54,528 --> 00:13:55,928
The topiary bues?

232
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:56,962
Yes.

233
00:13:56,964 --> 00:13:57,963
The teapot?

234
00:13:57,965 --> 00:13:59,465
Excellent.

235
00:13:59,467 --> 00:14:01,000
Then there's only
one item left

236
00:14:01,002 --> 00:14:03,168
on your to-do list,
master Jungjie.

237
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:06,138
Destroy Shifu.

238
00:14:07,642 --> 00:14:10,209
I thought I'd never
get around to that!

239
00:14:10,211 --> 00:14:13,012
Tomorrow bring Shifu
up from the catacombs.

240
00:14:13,014 --> 00:14:14,913
Shifu is still here?

241
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,094
It's only
the noodle shop delivery.

242
00:14:31,931 --> 00:14:36,201
Soon I will be the rightful
ruler of this province.

243
00:14:39,407 --> 00:14:41,607
Oh, garlic chow mein.

244
00:14:52,953 --> 00:14:54,520
How was the delivery?

245
00:14:54,522 --> 00:14:55,521
Bad!

246
00:14:55,523 --> 00:14:56,855
What, no tip?

247
00:14:56,857 --> 00:14:59,158
Jungjie has Shifu
and he's gonna destroy him!

248
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,626
The fiend!

249
00:15:00,628 --> 00:15:02,061
So... no tip?

250
00:15:02,063 --> 00:15:04,863
I-I gotta get the Furious Five
back together and rescue him.

251
00:15:04,865 --> 00:15:07,032
Good luck with that.

252
00:15:07,034 --> 00:15:09,368
They'll listen to me.

253
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,369
Will--

254
00:15:10,371 --> 00:15:12,004
You--
just--

255
00:15:12,006 --> 00:15:13,005
Listen--

256
00:15:13,007 --> 00:15:14,339
To me?

257
00:15:15,342 --> 00:15:16,341
You're right.

258
00:15:16,343 --> 00:15:19,211
They'll never listen to me.

259
00:15:20,714 --> 00:15:24,516
So I'm just gonna have
to do it alone.

260
00:15:24,518 --> 00:15:25,884
Alone?

261
00:15:25,886 --> 00:15:27,553
Po, it's impossible.

262
00:15:27,555 --> 00:15:31,356
You can't beat Jungjie and
those five creepy leopard guys!

263
00:15:31,358 --> 00:15:33,225
They are creepy, aren't they?

264
00:15:33,227 --> 00:15:34,993
And I hear
one of them's a girl,

265
00:15:34,995 --> 00:15:37,196
But which one?
Which?

266
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:38,230
It doesn't matter.

267
00:15:38,232 --> 00:15:39,665
It matters to her.

268
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:42,301
No, I mean it doesn't matter
if it's impossible.

269
00:15:42,303 --> 00:15:43,936
Shifu's life is at stake.

270
00:15:43,938 --> 00:15:45,738
I have to try!

271
00:16:07,194 --> 00:16:09,094
Oh, hey, Jungjie,
I was just, uh...

272
00:16:09,096 --> 00:16:11,196
Picking up some stuff
I left here, you know.

273
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:14,299
I mean, you--you seen a brown
duffel bag, kind of looks like--

274
00:16:15,736 --> 00:16:17,002
Enough chit-chat.

275
00:16:17,004 --> 00:16:18,237
I know you've got Shifu here

276
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:21,273
and I'm here to bust him out.

277
00:16:21,275 --> 00:16:24,510
Admirable,
since you unwittingly helped me

278
00:16:24,512 --> 00:16:26,945
trick Chao into giving me
the jade palace,

279
00:16:26,947 --> 00:16:29,815
not that it's hard to trick
that doddering old fool.

280
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,721
Master Chao!

281
00:16:35,723 --> 00:16:37,623
"That doddering old fool"

282
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:41,760
has come to check
on your progress, Jungjie.

283
00:16:41,762 --> 00:16:43,695
Luckily, I prepared for that.

284
00:16:49,904 --> 00:16:51,804
No!

285
00:16:51,806 --> 00:16:54,973
Master Chao.

286
00:16:54,975 --> 00:16:57,576
Poor panda.

287
00:17:01,181 --> 00:17:03,982
Happy birthday!

288
00:17:03,984 --> 00:17:05,117
Mister Ping?

289
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,285
It's your birthday?

290
00:17:06,287 --> 00:17:08,153
It's not me, it's Po.

291
00:17:08,155 --> 00:17:09,755
Po's birthday
and you hired us?

292
00:17:09,757 --> 00:17:11,056
Kinda weird.

293
00:17:11,058 --> 00:17:12,591
No, it's Shifu.

294
00:17:12,593 --> 00:17:14,760
Shifu's birthday
was two months ago.

295
00:17:14,762 --> 00:17:16,795
No, Jungjie--
Jungjie?

296
00:17:16,797 --> 00:17:18,831
Just let me finish!

297
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,966
Jungjie is holding Shifu prisoner,

298
00:17:20,968 --> 00:17:22,034
and Po went to the jade palace

299
00:17:22,036 --> 00:17:23,969
to rescue him all alone.

300
00:17:23,971 --> 00:17:26,071
You have to help him.

301
00:17:26,073 --> 00:17:27,739
Ha! Help Po?

302
00:17:27,741 --> 00:17:29,041
After what he did?

303
00:17:29,043 --> 00:17:30,275
Are you serious?

304
00:17:30,277 --> 00:17:33,412
Would you mind taking off
those ears?

305
00:17:33,414 --> 00:17:35,714
He probably just made that up
about Shifu.

306
00:17:35,716 --> 00:17:38,750
I mean, Jungjie
is a shaolin master.

307
00:17:38,752 --> 00:17:40,586
Listen to me, limp beak.

308
00:17:40,588 --> 00:17:42,154
My son may be not perfect,

309
00:17:42,156 --> 00:17:43,989
he may be big and loud
and clumsy

310
00:17:43,991 --> 00:17:46,291
and annoying and impatient
and hot-headed and--

311
00:17:46,293 --> 00:17:48,560
the--where--
where am I going with this?

312
00:17:48,562 --> 00:17:50,262
But he's not a liar.

313
00:17:50,264 --> 00:17:52,598
Right.

314
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,134
I say, let's do this.

315
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:01,573
Oh, good.

316
00:18:01,575 --> 00:18:04,243
My rescuer is here.

317
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:07,613
I'm sorry, Shifu.

318
00:18:07,615 --> 00:18:09,248
No, I'm sorry.

319
00:18:10,484 --> 00:18:12,751
I suspected that Jungjie
was up to something.

320
00:18:12,753 --> 00:18:15,320
I thought
I could handle it myself.

321
00:18:15,322 --> 00:18:18,290
So I pretended to leave,

322
00:18:18,292 --> 00:18:21,159
then returned later
to confront him.

323
00:18:26,132 --> 00:18:29,635
Jungjie fought without honor.

324
00:18:33,274 --> 00:18:35,440
I was beaten.

325
00:18:35,442 --> 00:18:39,645
Po, I always faulted you
for not following tradition,

326
00:18:39,647 --> 00:18:41,980
for sometimes ignoring
the old rules,

327
00:18:41,982 --> 00:18:44,249
But if I had been like you,

328
00:18:44,251 --> 00:18:46,618
maybe we wouldn't be here.

329
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,321
I think we all learned
an important lesson here.

330
00:18:49,323 --> 00:18:50,656
Yes, I suppose we--

331
00:18:50,658 --> 00:18:55,527
Like I learned how to do
the golden lotus clap!

332
00:19:01,035 --> 00:19:03,535
You learned
the golden lotus clap

333
00:19:03,537 --> 00:19:05,304
After seeing it only once?

334
00:19:05,306 --> 00:19:06,705
Incredible!

335
00:19:06,707 --> 00:19:10,008
Yeah, I'm what they call
"gifted."

336
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:13,011
You forgot to close your eyes,
didn't you?

337
00:19:13,013 --> 00:19:17,215
I'm also what they call
"blinded."

338
00:19:18,318 --> 00:19:19,985
That came from the catacombs!

339
00:19:19,987 --> 00:19:21,820
We can't let them escape!

340
00:19:21,822 --> 00:19:24,523
Hello, Jungjie.

341
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:27,960
Attack!

342
00:19:34,168 --> 00:19:36,168
I can't believe it.

343
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:39,037
Did you actually blind yourself?

344
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:43,108
Yeah, I like to give things
my own personal twist.

345
00:19:59,926 --> 00:20:01,226
You're an impressive fighter.

346
00:20:01,228 --> 00:20:04,129
You might even
stand a chance against me...

347
00:20:04,131 --> 00:20:06,131
if you could see.

348
00:20:08,534 --> 00:20:11,470
But how about if you couldn't?

349
00:20:23,549 --> 00:20:25,017
Fighting blind...

350
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:28,920
an interesting challenge.

351
00:20:28,922 --> 00:20:32,190
But I have one big advantage.

352
00:20:32,192 --> 00:20:33,425
What's that?

353
00:20:33,427 --> 00:20:36,261
I didn't have garlic chow mein
last night.

354
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,752
If I could see you,
this would be over in a second.

355
00:21:02,256 --> 00:21:05,190
Oh, it's over.

356
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,901
Po, it's Monkey!

357
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:18,070
Sorry.
Blind again.

358
00:21:18,072 --> 00:21:19,604
Wait, you guys came to help?

359
00:21:19,606 --> 00:21:21,440
Your dad talked us into it.

360
00:21:21,442 --> 00:21:24,943
Hey, did you hear? For once,
it really isn't all my fault.

361
00:21:24,945 --> 00:21:28,046
It's true.

362
00:21:28,048 --> 00:21:30,148
So, you guys smiling or what?

363
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,783
We're smiling, Po,

364
00:21:31,785 --> 00:21:33,418
Except for tigress.

365
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:37,756
I am smiling.
This is my happy face.

366
00:21:37,758 --> 00:21:42,794
Po, I think Shifu and I have
both learned a lesson from you.

367
00:21:42,796 --> 00:21:45,163
Shifu learned
something from me?

368
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,301
Sometimes doing
the right thing

369
00:21:49,303 --> 00:21:54,172
is more important
than following the old rules.

370
00:21:54,174 --> 00:21:57,409
Master Shifu, the way
your disciples handled this

371
00:21:57,411 --> 00:21:59,744
has proven to me
that the jade palace

372
00:21:59,746 --> 00:22:02,280
could have no better
leader than you.

373
00:22:02,282 --> 00:22:05,517
Please, accept my apologies.

374
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:09,254
Thank you, master Chao.

375
00:22:09,256 --> 00:22:12,991
Jungjie, I am taking
you and your creepy leopards

376
00:22:12,993 --> 00:22:14,493
to Chor Ghum prison.

377
00:22:14,495 --> 00:22:18,830
Oh, shrewd and beneficent
Chao, most merciful of all the--

378
00:22:23,769 --> 00:22:27,305
So... you learned something
from me? Heh heh!

379
00:22:27,307 --> 00:22:29,875
Maybe now I'll get a little
more respect around here.

380
00:22:29,877 --> 00:22:31,076
Oh, of course.

381
00:22:31,078 --> 00:22:33,345
In fact, I now respect you
so much

382
00:22:33,347 --> 00:22:36,214
that I won't insult you
by fixing your eyesight.

383
00:22:36,216 --> 00:22:37,716
What?

384
00:22:37,718 --> 00:22:40,485
Wait! Okay,
maybe I'm not that wise.

385
00:22:40,487 --> 00:22:42,020
I just----
I mean--

386
00:22:42,022 --> 00:22:45,524
Okay, fine, go on!
Yeah, I don't need your help,

387
00:22:45,526 --> 00:22:48,960
'cause I can do the golden
lotus clap all by myse--
