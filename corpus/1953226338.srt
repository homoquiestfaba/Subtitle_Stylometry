1
00:01:34,647 --> 00:01:36,239
Coming Sister.

2
00:01:38,527 --> 00:01:39,676
Sister?

3
00:01:39,887 --> 00:01:41,605
I'm looking for Father McKinnon.

4
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:43,439
- Father.
- I'm Father McKinnon.

5
00:01:44,527 --> 00:01:46,007
Good morning.
What can I do for you?

6
00:01:46,647 --> 00:01:47,841
My name is Thurman.

7
00:01:49,327 --> 00:01:51,204
Hannibal Thurman.
Do you remember me?

8
00:01:51,687 --> 00:01:52,722
Well it's...

9
00:01:53,487 --> 00:01:55,842
some years ago as I recall but...

10
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,398
you are the business associate of
Arthur Barret.

11
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:01,240
Arthur Barret is dead.

12
00:02:02,167 --> 00:02:03,919
He died of a stroke 2 days ago.

13
00:02:06,207 --> 00:02:08,675
In a list of instructions before his death.

14
00:02:10,087 --> 00:02:11,156
He...

15
00:02:13,887 --> 00:02:15,206
said you would explain...

16
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:19,282
everything to me, whatever that means.

17
00:02:20,887 --> 00:02:24,357
This is a codicil to his last
will and testament.

18
00:02:24,567 --> 00:02:26,444
I didn't know it existed until yesterday.

19
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:29,515
- I'm a priest, not a lawyer.
- Father...

20
00:02:31,407 --> 00:02:34,717
It states that I'm obliged to answer
to you although I am not a catholic...

21
00:02:36,367 --> 00:02:39,279
and that I need your blessing
before I can assume...

22
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:41,758
Legal custody of his two sons.

23
00:02:45,247 --> 00:02:47,920
And the boys, they must be what...

24
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:49,520
- 16 now?
- Yes.

25
00:02:50,327 --> 00:02:51,840
And are they like him?

26
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:54,679
Yes. One is.

27
00:02:55,327 --> 00:02:56,885
The other, he's a rebel.

28
00:02:57,727 --> 00:03:00,287
Very much like his mother, Eleanor, was.

29
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:04,605
But they are both Barret's,
if that's what you're asking.

30
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:06,319
Stubborn and proud.

31
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:11,319
You have my blessing Mr. Thurman.

32
00:03:11,767 --> 00:03:12,916
Father...

33
00:03:14,087 --> 00:03:16,237
- is that it?
- That's it.

34
00:03:17,887 --> 00:03:18,876
Father...

35
00:03:19,327 --> 00:03:20,646
I repeat...

36
00:03:21,967 --> 00:03:24,322
Arthur insisted that you
explain everything to me...

37
00:03:24,407 --> 00:03:27,001
and I would assume, that as
a man of the cloth...

38
00:03:27,167 --> 00:03:28,646
you will honor his wish.

39
00:03:34,207 --> 00:03:35,196
Very well.

40
00:03:37,487 --> 00:03:38,886
Sit down Mr. Thurman.

41
00:03:42,127 --> 00:03:44,083
I assume as a lawyer you can...

42
00:03:45,087 --> 00:03:48,284
recognize a logical
motive when you see one.

43
00:03:51,327 --> 00:03:54,364
Then perhaps secrets aren't logical.

44
00:03:57,087 --> 00:03:59,123
I don't know why it had to
happen in this way.

45
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:04,476
It just did.

46
00:04:19,527 --> 00:04:22,200
<i>St. Jude's parish was</i>
<i>my first assignment.</i>

47
00:04:22,367 --> 00:04:24,164
<i>But it was my last choice.</i>

48
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:26,001
<i>I didn't want to go there.</i>

49
00:04:31,327 --> 00:04:32,442
<i>It was a rich parish...</i>

50
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:35,161
<i>with good living quarters</i>
<i>and a wealth of opportunity.</i>

51
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:42,397
<i>All my friends in seminary envied me...</i>

52
00:04:42,527 --> 00:04:45,724
<i>but big religion and big money</i>
<i>was the last thing I wanted.</i>

53
00:04:48,887 --> 00:04:52,163
<i>But my father's influence in the</i>
<i>Church quickly squelched all that...</i>

54
00:04:52,367 --> 00:04:54,244
<i>and landed me in Boston.</i>

55
00:04:57,967 --> 00:05:00,242
<i>This was my father's way,</i>
<i>of keeping tabs on me...</i>

56
00:05:00,807 --> 00:05:03,685
<i>keeping his hand in the game</i>
<i>of controlling my life.</i>

57
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,042
<i>They say all is fair in love and war.</i>

58
00:05:08,327 --> 00:05:11,364
<i>I suppose this was his way</i>
<i>of getting even with me...</i>

59
00:05:11,487 --> 00:05:12,886
<i>for becoming a priest.</i>

60
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:23,162
<i>A rich parish obligated me to remain</i>
<i>close enough to the upper crust...</i>

61
00:05:23,447 --> 00:05:26,803
<i>so that I would never loose my</i>
<i>way back home when the time came.</i>

62
00:05:45,527 --> 00:05:47,199
<i>But despite my father's scheme...</i>

63
00:05:47,367 --> 00:05:49,961
<i>I was determined to make</i>
<i>the best of my new home.</i>

64
00:05:50,527 --> 00:05:53,485
<i>I would work hard, help the needy...</i>

65
00:05:53,927 --> 00:05:55,280
<i>and serve God.</i>

66
00:05:56,327 --> 00:05:57,521
<i>And with any luck...</i>

67
00:05:58,087 --> 00:06:01,523
<i>I'd be able to avoid the one person</i>
<i>in Boston I had no desire to meet...</i>

68
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,806
<i>Arthur Barret.</i>

69
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:20,635
Your attention, please.
Attention everyone.

70
00:06:21,327 --> 00:06:23,557
Eleanor, I believe you have
an announcement to make.

71
00:06:23,647 --> 00:06:24,841
Thank you, Hannibal.

72
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:28,318
I think all of you know
my husband well enough...

73
00:06:28,647 --> 00:06:29,762
to know that...

74
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:33,920
if humility were a cup of tea,
his cup would runneth over.

75
00:06:34,367 --> 00:06:39,839
So, I would like to take this
opportunity to do brag for him...

76
00:06:40,047 --> 00:06:41,275
and to tell you about...

77
00:06:41,327 --> 00:06:45,286
his appointment to President
Roosevelt's foreign finance committee.

78
00:06:46,127 --> 00:06:48,357
They couldn't have picked
a better man for the job.

79
00:06:50,047 --> 00:06:51,639
Congratulations!

80
00:06:52,087 --> 00:06:56,399
Thank you my dear.
What can I say to that...

81
00:06:56,527 --> 00:06:58,807
except to add that what gives
a man the right to brag...

82
00:06:58,808 --> 00:07:00,488
are not so much his accomplishments but...

83
00:07:01,607 --> 00:07:03,962
the friends that he has to share them with.

84
00:07:09,527 --> 00:07:12,280
Madame?
You have a telephone call.

85
00:07:12,927 --> 00:07:14,679
- Is this it?
- It might be.

86
00:07:20,847 --> 00:07:22,838
- Hello Mark.
<i>- Eleanor, hello.</i>

87
00:07:22,927 --> 00:07:25,127
- Do you have news about the book?
<i>- Wonderful news...</i>

88
00:07:25,247 --> 00:07:27,761
<i>- Scribner's are picking it up.</i>
- Not really.

89
00:07:29,527 --> 00:07:31,324
No. That's wonderful.

90
00:07:31,767 --> 00:07:33,166
Yes.

91
00:07:34,007 --> 00:07:36,237
- What did he say?
- Scribner's is mad for it.

92
00:07:36,407 --> 00:07:38,716
Yes, they want to publish it this fall.

93
00:07:47,647 --> 00:07:50,002
Can we expect this on to be
banned in Boston too?

94
00:07:50,207 --> 00:07:53,165
I certainly hope so.
I've got my reputation to uphold.

95
00:08:03,127 --> 00:08:04,879
- Eleanor?
- Come in.

96
00:08:05,287 --> 00:08:08,518
- Are you ill?
- No. I'm just counting.

97
00:08:10,087 --> 00:08:11,645
Syril...

98
00:08:12,647 --> 00:08:15,525
- I think this is it.
- It's a beautiful day.

99
00:08:16,727 --> 00:08:18,479
But is it "the day"?

100
00:08:18,927 --> 00:08:20,838
Well, well. Let's see.

101
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,603
- One, two...
- Good morning.

102
00:08:24,887 --> 00:08:26,286
- Syril.
- Arthur.

103
00:08:29,687 --> 00:08:30,756
I love you.

104
00:08:33,927 --> 00:08:35,440
Did you sleep well?

105
00:08:37,047 --> 00:08:38,116
Me too.

106
00:08:39,047 --> 00:08:41,641
Though I had a marginal night's sleep...

107
00:08:41,807 --> 00:08:44,367
I had a wonderful dream this morning.

108
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:45,636
Tell me.

109
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:49,835
I dreamed that I was holding our baby.

110
00:08:51,847 --> 00:08:54,156
I was feeding it from a bottle.

111
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:58,923
- Was it a boy or a girl?
- I don't know.

112
00:08:59,607 --> 00:09:02,326
I gave it to you when it
came time to change it.

113
00:09:02,927 --> 00:09:04,485
That's terrible.

114
00:09:04,727 --> 00:09:06,399
Not at all.
It was a beautiful dream.

115
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:14,202
What is it?

116
00:09:15,607 --> 00:09:17,404
It's the 12th day.

117
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:19,997
Our odds are best if we try
today or tomorrow.

118
00:09:20,367 --> 00:09:21,402
Well then.

119
00:09:24,687 --> 00:09:26,882
It would appear that
everything is in place.

120
00:09:29,327 --> 00:09:31,283
Tonight we'll make the dream a reality.

121
00:09:37,247 --> 00:09:39,238
Do you have to go
to the office this morning?

122
00:09:43,367 --> 00:09:47,406
Mr. Thurman will be
right with you Mr. Martin.

123
00:09:56,927 --> 00:09:58,042
Greetings, Mr. Martin.

124
00:09:58,127 --> 00:10:00,167
How good of you to come back
on such short notice.

125
00:10:00,327 --> 00:10:02,363
- Of course.
- I've been reviewing your file.

126
00:10:02,407 --> 00:10:04,967
- Very impressive young man.
- Thank you, sir.

127
00:10:05,207 --> 00:10:07,084
I imagine the top student at Harvard...

128
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:10,204
- has had an offer or two.
- Three, actually.

129
00:10:10,807 --> 00:10:13,116
- Have you been tempted yet?
- Not really.

130
00:10:13,207 --> 00:10:14,356
I've been holding back...

131
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,837
I was genuinely hoping for an
invitation to come on here.

132
00:10:18,007 --> 00:10:19,201
- Really?
- Yes, sir.

133
00:10:19,287 --> 00:10:21,727
I am not embarrassed to admit
that Arthur Barret has been...

134
00:10:21,728 --> 00:10:25,076
an idol of mine. His reputation
at Harvard is legendary.

135
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:28,525
How flattering for him, and for us.
I'm glad to hear you say that.

136
00:10:28,847 --> 00:10:30,917
I've always said that
desire and motivation...

137
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:34,239
are two thirds of any successful
employment equation.

138
00:10:34,607 --> 00:10:36,802
- And the other one third?
- Resolve.

139
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:38,838
The ability to do what it takes...

140
00:10:38,927 --> 00:10:41,646
to achieve one's goal
no matter what the cost.

141
00:10:44,287 --> 00:10:47,245
- Are you such a man, Mr. Martin?
- I assume so, yes.

142
00:10:47,687 --> 00:10:48,836
Assume?

143
00:10:49,807 --> 00:10:53,322
I can't be absolutely certain.
I've never been tested.

144
00:10:53,647 --> 00:10:56,207
An open mind. Good.
I like that.

145
00:10:57,487 --> 00:11:01,036
I believe Mr. Martin,
what I am about to propose...

146
00:11:01,287 --> 00:11:03,755
is just such a test.

147
00:11:04,487 --> 00:11:05,556
However...

148
00:11:05,967 --> 00:11:09,323
before I begin I must tell you that
what I'm about to divulge...

149
00:11:09,407 --> 00:11:10,999
must never leave this room.

150
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:13,806
- Do you understand?
- Yes. Of course.

151
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:15,965
I must have your word, sir.

152
00:11:16,487 --> 00:11:19,365
Complete discretion and confidentiality.

153
00:11:23,887 --> 00:11:25,400
Very well, you have my word then.

154
00:11:34,647 --> 00:11:36,000
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

155
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:42,241
Good afternoon, James.

156
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,807
- Good afternoon, ma'am.
- Do you know what time it is, dear?

157
00:11:44,927 --> 00:11:47,646
I know, but Virginia Wade
kept going on and on.

158
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:50,687
I know it takes a good deal of
planning to feed over 500 people...

159
00:11:50,688 --> 00:11:52,968
but, bless her heart, she even
had Father Dryer napping.

160
00:11:53,287 --> 00:11:55,327
Where are you going, now?
You've got to get ready.

161
00:11:55,328 --> 00:11:58,165
I've got to get something to eat.
I have butterflies.

162
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:00,000
That makes two of us.

163
00:12:02,247 --> 00:12:04,363
<i>What you have to understand</i>
<i>about Eleanor...</i>

164
00:12:04,487 --> 00:12:06,443
<i>is that she cherished above all else...</i>

165
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:08,762
<i>a room to call her own.</i>

166
00:12:10,767 --> 00:12:12,246
<i>A place to explore...</i>

167
00:12:12,327 --> 00:12:14,841
<i>to nurture and develop free thought...</i>

168
00:12:14,927 --> 00:12:17,964
<i>uncharacterized by a man's</i>
<i>influences and convention.</i>

169
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:22,241
<i>It was a temple for no religion.</i>
<i>And no expectation save one...</i>

170
00:12:22,847 --> 00:12:24,838
<i>to be at peace with herself.</i>

171
00:12:25,447 --> 00:12:29,042
<i>Eleanor's God was as much female as male.</i>

172
00:12:30,007 --> 00:12:30,996
Thank you.

173
00:12:41,647 --> 00:12:42,716
Is she nervous?

174
00:12:44,247 --> 00:12:45,362
Of course.

175
00:12:47,047 --> 00:12:48,400
What is she doing now?

176
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:51,166
Getting ready I presume.

177
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,126
Anything I can do?

178
00:12:57,207 --> 00:12:58,242
Yes.

179
00:12:59,607 --> 00:13:03,156
Be husband enough to stand beside her
and hold her hand while it happens...

180
00:13:04,287 --> 00:13:05,640
that or call it off.

181
00:13:08,407 --> 00:13:10,921
Don't condescend to me, Syril.

182
00:13:12,327 --> 00:13:14,887
- I won't stand for it.
- Then don't allow this to happen.

183
00:13:14,967 --> 00:13:16,480
It's an abomination.

184
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:20,039
This child will ruin your marriage.

185
00:13:20,287 --> 00:13:21,800
How can you say such a thing?

186
00:13:23,007 --> 00:13:25,237
I love Eleanor more than my own life.

187
00:13:25,327 --> 00:13:26,919
Is this supposed to prove it?

188
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,601
Yes. This is the one thing
I cannot give her.

189
00:13:30,007 --> 00:13:31,326
It's the only answer.

190
00:13:32,567 --> 00:13:36,446
- I badly need an heir.
- I know, but believe me...

191
00:13:37,487 --> 00:13:41,400
you are making a grave mistake if
you allow her to conceive this baby.

192
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,955
God forgive me for saying this, but...

193
00:13:44,767 --> 00:13:47,759
- that was spoken like a man.
- Good.

194
00:13:48,687 --> 00:13:52,646
It will open your ears
and command your respect.

195
00:13:53,687 --> 00:13:55,359
I'm sure it serves your male vanity...

196
00:13:55,487 --> 00:13:58,923
to assume you can control any
situation that you put your mind to.

197
00:13:59,127 --> 00:14:03,006
- But you're mistaken.
- How?

198
00:14:03,807 --> 00:14:07,766
You are about to give an educated
woman complete control of her life.

199
00:14:07,967 --> 00:14:11,676
For a man in your position,
that's a dangerous thing.

200
00:14:11,887 --> 00:14:15,402
Eleanor has always had complete
freedom to do as she wishes.

201
00:14:15,447 --> 00:14:18,086
Haven't I given her everything
she's ever asked for?

202
00:14:18,487 --> 00:14:21,206
What's the problem with
my giving her a baby?

203
00:14:21,647 --> 00:14:23,239
Would you care to rephrase that?

204
00:14:24,607 --> 00:14:25,676
No.

205
00:14:28,647 --> 00:14:30,478
I want you to stay awake all night.

206
00:14:32,327 --> 00:14:34,397
Available to you should she need you.

207
00:14:35,127 --> 00:14:36,355
Of course.

208
00:14:37,287 --> 00:14:39,881
If there's nothing more, I'll go to her.

209
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,242
There is one thing.

210
00:14:44,007 --> 00:14:46,316
This cannot happen in either
one of our bedrooms.

211
00:14:47,047 --> 00:14:49,607
Eleanor asked to have one
of the guest rooms made up.

212
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:53,000
What's he like?

213
00:14:57,167 --> 00:14:58,282
He's young...

214
00:15:00,927 --> 00:15:03,077
Young like I used to be.

215
00:15:06,327 --> 00:15:07,840
You want me to do what?

216
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:09,919
We prefer the term impregnate.

217
00:15:09,967 --> 00:15:13,198
But yes, you must serve as
Mr. Barret's surrogate.

218
00:15:13,327 --> 00:15:15,283
Good God! You're serious!

219
00:15:15,647 --> 00:15:19,242
Yes. But in the interests
of accuracy...

220
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,038
we would like to employ you.

221
00:15:22,207 --> 00:15:25,358
And you would be generously compensated.

222
00:15:38,727 --> 00:15:40,046
Yes. Indeed.

223
00:15:42,927 --> 00:15:44,645
Good idea. I'll join you.

224
00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:52,601
I have a few questions.

225
00:15:52,887 --> 00:15:55,765
- Such as?
- Why?

226
00:15:55,967 --> 00:15:58,207
Because Mr. and Mrs. Barret
want a child desperately...

227
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,480
and Mr. Barret cannot conceive.

228
00:16:00,047 --> 00:16:01,480
Call me old fashioned, but...

229
00:16:01,567 --> 00:16:04,445
- what about adoption?
- Adoption is out of the question.

230
00:16:04,647 --> 00:16:08,037
Mrs. Barret wishes to experience
the real thing...

231
00:16:08,207 --> 00:16:09,847
from the moment of conception to birth...

232
00:16:09,848 --> 00:16:12,287
- She feels it's her right.
- Yeah. I understand.

233
00:16:12,447 --> 00:16:13,880
No. I doubt that.

234
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:17,923
But I do think we can both grasp the...

235
00:16:18,087 --> 00:16:21,523
Logic of her desire to have
a child of her own blood.

236
00:16:22,407 --> 00:16:23,396
When?

237
00:16:23,527 --> 00:16:25,563
- Tonight.
- Tonight?

238
00:16:26,407 --> 00:16:28,841
I'm sorry for such short notice...

239
00:16:29,847 --> 00:16:32,884
but you know how these things go.
Mother nature and all that.

240
00:16:45,967 --> 00:16:47,685
<i>Wrapped in her own thought...</i>

241
00:16:47,767 --> 00:16:49,883
<i>Eleanor meticulously prepared...</i>

242
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:52,202
<i>to exercise the ultimate privilege...</i>

243
00:16:52,327 --> 00:16:53,840
<i>of being her own person.</i>

244
00:16:57,327 --> 00:16:59,557
<i>Contemplative, focused...</i>

245
00:16:59,687 --> 00:17:01,518
<i>and quietly confident with her decision...</i>

246
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:04,276
<i>she knew in her heart that she was ready.</i>

247
00:17:05,207 --> 00:17:07,243
<i>But do not judge this scene too quickly.</i>

248
00:17:07,807 --> 00:17:10,196
<i>For this was not the ritual</i>
<i>of a pampered princess...</i>

249
00:17:10,607 --> 00:17:12,723
<i>so much as it was attention to detail...</i>

250
00:17:12,967 --> 00:17:14,878
<i>by the author of a master plan.</i>

251
00:17:17,007 --> 00:17:20,044
<i>In the end, I could only</i>
<i>sympathize with Arthur.</i>

252
00:17:20,967 --> 00:17:23,197
<i>What a cruel and unusual punishment!</i>

253
00:17:23,567 --> 00:17:25,762
<i>To know whatever went on behind her door...</i>

254
00:17:26,047 --> 00:17:27,924
<i>had nothing to do with him.</i>

255
00:17:28,487 --> 00:17:30,000
<i>Her man.</i>

256
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:37,565
Shall I give you the details?

257
00:17:38,087 --> 00:17:39,918
You mean I don't have them already?

258
00:17:40,007 --> 00:17:42,646
- Are you being snide with me?
- I'm sorry...

259
00:17:42,807 --> 00:17:46,516
you don't expect me to take this
proposition seriously, do you?

260
00:17:46,687 --> 00:17:48,598
I come to this firm in good faith...

261
00:17:48,647 --> 00:17:50,365
seeking respectable employment...

262
00:17:50,407 --> 00:17:54,639
and you insult me with this sordid
scheme of fornication.

263
00:17:54,727 --> 00:17:58,276
If that's how it sounds my
presentation has not been effective.

264
00:17:58,447 --> 00:18:01,325
It's not your presentation
that needs examination...

265
00:18:01,407 --> 00:18:02,727
it is the virtue of your mission.

266
00:18:02,728 --> 00:18:05,116
My mission is to help
my oldest and dearest friend...

267
00:18:05,247 --> 00:18:08,239
in an intensely important
and delicate situation.

268
00:18:08,447 --> 00:18:10,836
I was honored that he chose me to do it.

269
00:18:11,047 --> 00:18:13,163
My God. What kind of a man
is Arthur Barret?

270
00:18:13,367 --> 00:18:16,484
The kind of a man, Mr. Martin,
who has the ability...

271
00:18:17,367 --> 00:18:20,439
to achieve his goals
no matter what the cost.

272
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:31,038
Then he is either a very strong man
or a very stupid one.

273
00:18:31,887 --> 00:18:35,960
There are some thing in life
which are better left undone...

274
00:18:36,287 --> 00:18:38,005
no matter what the cost.

275
00:18:38,047 --> 00:18:42,006
I'm very sorry we have
offended you, Mr. Martin.

276
00:18:42,327 --> 00:18:43,396
I can only hope...

277
00:18:43,527 --> 00:18:48,237
that in time you'll come to see the
great compliment of this proposition.

278
00:18:48,687 --> 00:18:50,359
- Compliment?
- Yes. Think about it.

279
00:18:50,687 --> 00:18:52,598
You were selected to surrogate his child...

280
00:18:52,927 --> 00:18:56,203
Arthur found your profile,
meaning your intellect...

281
00:18:56,327 --> 00:18:59,239
your personality, even your appearance...

282
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:02,206
desirable attributes for a child
of his own to inherit.

283
00:19:02,927 --> 00:19:05,122
In a sense...

284
00:19:05,887 --> 00:19:09,323
Arthur Barret idolized you.

285
00:19:13,247 --> 00:19:14,521
Gee, I hadn't thought of that.

286
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:16,762
I'll be honest Roger-
May I call you Roger?

287
00:19:16,927 --> 00:19:19,805
- Please.
- I'm not sure I'd pass up the money...

288
00:19:19,887 --> 00:19:23,038
just for making love to a beautiful woman.

289
00:19:23,327 --> 00:19:25,761
I guess we never actually
progressed to talking money.

290
00:19:25,887 --> 00:19:27,479
Not that it matters, but...

291
00:19:28,247 --> 00:19:30,886
- how much are we talking about?
- 25,000.

292
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,282
25,000 dollars?

293
00:19:34,647 --> 00:19:36,683
Did I mention how beautiful she is?

294
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:40,283
- Beautiful?
- Ravishing.

295
00:19:41,687 --> 00:19:43,245
You know, Roger...

296
00:19:43,447 --> 00:19:46,041
I'm not sure Arthur was right
about you after all.

297
00:19:46,327 --> 00:19:47,680
- No?
- No.

298
00:19:48,007 --> 00:19:51,556
Now that I think about it,
you must be some sort of damn fool.

299
00:19:51,967 --> 00:19:53,878
Well, very good luck to you.

300
00:19:54,887 --> 00:19:57,481
- Hello, Mr. Thurman.
- Mr. Harrington.

301
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,836
Harrington?

302
00:20:00,047 --> 00:20:01,647
- Hello Rog.
- What are you doing here?

303
00:20:02,207 --> 00:20:04,207
Applying for the same position
as you I expect...

304
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,528
that is if it is still available.

305
00:20:05,727 --> 00:20:07,683
- Yes.
- No, no!

306
00:20:09,127 --> 00:20:11,482
The truth is I've had second
thoughts about your offer.

307
00:20:11,607 --> 00:20:12,881
- Really?
- I accept.

308
00:20:13,847 --> 00:20:16,441
Perhaps I wasn't thinking clearly
because I was so...

309
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:19,117
- flattered.
- Flattered?

310
00:20:20,047 --> 00:20:23,039
It seems the position has
been filled Mr. Harrington...

311
00:20:23,087 --> 00:20:25,123
however we'll keep your
information on file...

312
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:28,964
should Mr. Martin's services
not work out.

313
00:20:29,247 --> 00:20:31,477
- Thank you, I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

314
00:20:32,527 --> 00:20:35,166
Well, Rog, congratulations are in order.

315
00:20:35,927 --> 00:20:37,201
Good luck with it.

316
00:20:37,607 --> 00:20:38,801
Luck, right...

317
00:20:43,687 --> 00:20:47,680
Thank you. You won't regret this.
I can almost guarantee...

318
00:20:47,887 --> 00:20:49,206
that she will enjoy it.

319
00:20:51,047 --> 00:20:54,244
<i>It was obvious to Hannibal,</i>
<i>that young Roger Martin...</i>

320
00:20:54,407 --> 00:20:56,284
<i>was in way over his head.</i>

321
00:21:31,487 --> 00:21:33,876
- Mrs. Barret?
- No.

322
00:21:35,887 --> 00:21:39,004
I believe Mrs. Barret
is expecting me.

323
00:21:39,327 --> 00:21:40,362
Roger Martin.

324
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:44,918
I'll inform her that
you have arrived, Mr. Martin.

325
00:21:45,807 --> 00:21:47,604
- Please come in.
- Thank you.

326
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,116
Well.

327
00:21:57,207 --> 00:21:59,675
- Well what?
- What of him?

328
00:22:00,687 --> 00:22:02,006
How does he look?

329
00:22:03,087 --> 00:22:05,317
- Pubescent.
- Oh stop, Syril.

330
00:22:05,767 --> 00:22:07,246
Arthur said he was 24.

331
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:10,319
Still, the poor baby thinks this is a date.

332
00:22:11,047 --> 00:22:13,242
- What do you mean?
- See for yourself.

333
00:22:18,167 --> 00:22:19,202
He's right down there.

334
00:22:24,567 --> 00:22:26,842
Hello, Mrs. Barret,
these are for you.

335
00:22:28,367 --> 00:22:30,961
Hello, Mrs. Barret...

336
00:22:38,087 --> 00:22:40,601
You're right. He was so much older
looking in the picture.

337
00:22:40,727 --> 00:22:42,319
I won't be surprised if you have to...

338
00:22:42,367 --> 00:22:44,562
- What?
- Show him where it goes.

339
00:22:46,727 --> 00:22:51,721
- You don't think he's never done it?
- I don't know, didn't see his resume.

340
00:23:11,407 --> 00:23:12,476
Good evening.

341
00:23:14,807 --> 00:23:15,876
Good evening.

342
00:23:17,207 --> 00:23:19,880
- Mr. Martin, I presume.
- At your service Mrs. Barret.

343
00:23:20,367 --> 00:23:24,406
- No... what I mean to say is...
- I know what you mean, thank you.

344
00:23:26,247 --> 00:23:28,078
How lovely.
Are they for me?

345
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,396
Yes.

346
00:23:30,047 --> 00:23:32,083
- Sorry.
- It's nothing, just a scratch.

347
00:23:32,247 --> 00:23:33,919
I've cut you!
I can't believe it.

348
00:23:34,047 --> 00:23:36,083
- I'm fine.
- I knew I would botch it...

349
00:23:36,127 --> 00:23:38,038
and we're not even at the hard part yet.

350
00:23:38,327 --> 00:23:42,036
I did so want everything to go well,
I thought I might be good at this...

351
00:23:42,247 --> 00:23:43,807
- Roger.
- I'm not cut out for this...

352
00:23:43,854 --> 00:23:45,294
- this is for someone big.
- Roger!

353
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,281
Yes, Mrs. Barret?

354
00:23:48,047 --> 00:23:49,526
Is it that uncomfortable for you?

355
00:23:50,727 --> 00:23:51,842
God yes.

356
00:23:52,927 --> 00:23:54,076
Unbearable?

357
00:23:56,887 --> 00:24:01,119
At this moment, I would just
as soon vanish and die.

358
00:24:03,447 --> 00:24:05,165
You're a very sweet man.

359
00:24:05,847 --> 00:24:08,964
In light of your obvious misgivings
if you feel you must go...

360
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,397
- I'm truly sorry, Mrs. Barret.
- Not at all.

361
00:24:39,047 --> 00:24:40,162
<i>As a Catholic priest...</i>

362
00:24:40,247 --> 00:24:43,603
<i>my orientation as to the</i>
<i>definition of bonafide miracle...</i>

363
00:24:43,807 --> 00:24:46,401
<i>has always been:</i>
<i>Divine intervention...</i>

364
00:24:46,607 --> 00:24:48,040
<i>plus a little more.</i>

365
00:24:48,447 --> 00:24:50,647
<i>So in this instance, a timely</i>
<i>flat tire might raise...</i>

366
00:24:50,648 --> 00:24:53,763
<i>a few superstitious eyebrows...</i>

367
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:57,167
<i>it's hardly food for thought for</i>
<i>those of us professionally trained...</i>

368
00:24:57,168 --> 00:24:58,878
<i>to recognize the hand of God.</i>

369
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:03,005
<i>When in the pursuit of miracles</i>
<i>timing is everything.</i>

370
00:25:03,727 --> 00:25:06,161
<i>It was beginning to look as if</i>
<i>the hand God was attached...</i>

371
00:25:06,247 --> 00:25:08,124
<i>to a damn good wristwatch.</i>

372
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:10,684
<i>Something wondrous happened.</i>

373
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:35,519
<i>It was a tough decision</i>
<i>but he reasoned it out.</i>

374
00:25:35,927 --> 00:25:38,282
<i>The miracle of life is fraught</i>
<i>with compromise.</i>

375
00:25:38,407 --> 00:25:40,841
<i>The key to success is not</i>
<i>so much pride as it is...</i>

376
00:25:40,887 --> 00:25:43,276
<i>dignity in accomplishing one's goals.</i>

377
00:25:43,447 --> 00:25:46,883
<i>And so, Roger realized that he</i>
<i>simply couldn't bear the thought...</i>

378
00:25:47,007 --> 00:25:49,840
<i>of having that beautiful,</i>
<i>desirable, rich woman...</i>

379
00:25:50,407 --> 00:25:52,047
<i>stand in he warm mansion and watch him...</i>

380
00:25:52,048 --> 00:25:54,567
<i>change that tire in the rain.</i>

381
00:25:56,327 --> 00:25:58,761
<i>He decided to make love to her instead.</i>

382
00:26:35,567 --> 00:26:36,636
Roger?

383
00:26:39,967 --> 00:26:42,640
- Yes, Mr. Barret?
- Is everything alright?

384
00:26:43,767 --> 00:26:45,997
Yes. Why do you ask?

385
00:26:47,167 --> 00:26:49,840
You've been in there for nearly 20 minutes.

386
00:26:51,887 --> 00:26:52,956
Oh?

387
00:26:53,807 --> 00:26:56,275
- May I come in?
- Well you know...

388
00:26:56,927 --> 00:26:58,246
if you could...

389
00:27:01,687 --> 00:27:03,279
- Hello.
- Hello, Roger.

390
00:27:03,527 --> 00:27:04,562
Are you ill?

391
00:27:04,887 --> 00:27:07,481
- No.
- Is there a problem then?

392
00:27:10,127 --> 00:27:12,567
A slight one, but if I could
just have a few more minutes...

393
00:27:12,568 --> 00:27:14,561
- Tell me.
- I'd rather not.

394
00:27:15,807 --> 00:27:19,117
- Is it me?
- No, it's me.

395
00:27:19,527 --> 00:27:21,518
Well what then?
Perhaps I can help.

396
00:27:23,327 --> 00:27:25,397
Well it seems that I have...

397
00:27:26,047 --> 00:27:27,116
an...

398
00:27:30,007 --> 00:27:31,042
you know...

399
00:27:31,727 --> 00:27:33,957
- An erection?
- I'm sorry.

400
00:27:34,607 --> 00:27:37,485
You've been hiding for 20 minutes
because you have an erection?

401
00:27:38,167 --> 00:27:40,283
It's the anticipation I'm afraid...

402
00:27:40,807 --> 00:27:43,446
And you feel somehow that
I'll be offended by that?

403
00:27:44,967 --> 00:27:48,880
Well, yes. I don't want you to think
I'm some sort of sexual animal.

404
00:27:49,767 --> 00:27:52,520
Mr. Martin, we're counting on it.

405
00:27:53,927 --> 00:27:55,679
Now, please, can we get on with this?

406
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:58,480
I'll be right there, Mrs. Barret.

407
00:27:58,647 --> 00:28:01,286
- Eleanor.
- Eleanor, Eleanor.

408
00:28:06,367 --> 00:28:07,846
I don't believe it.

409
00:28:13,327 --> 00:28:14,680
- Ready.
- Me too.

410
00:28:21,887 --> 00:28:22,956
What's the matter now?

411
00:28:25,887 --> 00:28:28,037
We've got a problem.
I'm going down.

412
00:28:29,327 --> 00:28:30,521
It's the...

413
00:28:34,807 --> 00:28:38,595
Roger, there are no problems.

414
00:28:39,127 --> 00:28:40,606
Only solutions.

415
00:28:55,327 --> 00:28:56,999
- Roger.
- Yes, Mrs. Barret.

416
00:28:57,367 --> 00:28:58,720
Not that it really matters but...

417
00:28:58,807 --> 00:29:01,367
I believe it's usually customary
to take off your socks.

418
00:29:01,687 --> 00:29:03,405
Damn! I knew that.

419
00:29:39,007 --> 00:29:41,919
<i>When Roger Martin emerged into</i>
<i>the bright morning sunshine...</i>

420
00:29:42,087 --> 00:29:45,477
<i>he stepped toward</i>
<i>that flat tire like a new man.</i>

421
00:29:45,687 --> 00:29:48,918
<i>His head was high and his step</i>
<i>was charged with affirmation.</i>

422
00:29:49,047 --> 00:29:50,480
<i>He was a stud.</i>

423
00:30:12,807 --> 00:30:16,595
- Thanks for that.
- That's very generous, but no.

424
00:30:16,767 --> 00:30:18,564
- Thank you.
- Right.

425
00:30:20,127 --> 00:30:21,560
Stupid.

426
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:16,876
Father Michael.

427
00:31:19,767 --> 00:31:21,723
You asked me to flag Arthur Barret?

428
00:31:24,407 --> 00:31:26,079
They make a very handsome couple.

429
00:31:26,727 --> 00:31:27,796
His wife is Eleanor.

430
00:31:27,887 --> 00:31:30,924
Yes. The writer. She's brilliant.
I've read some of her work.

431
00:31:31,327 --> 00:31:33,283
Don't admit that to the cardinal.

432
00:31:35,847 --> 00:31:37,166
What about him, Father?

433
00:31:37,247 --> 00:31:39,841
I heard he can be something of a tyrant.

434
00:31:39,887 --> 00:31:40,956
Tyrant?

435
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:43,041
I don't know who told you that.

436
00:31:43,127 --> 00:31:46,403
- I doubt it was anyone in Boston...
- Father Dryer, a minute please.

437
00:32:14,087 --> 00:32:17,318
<i>In nomine patris et filii</i>
<i>et spiritus sancti.</i>

438
00:32:18,367 --> 00:32:20,244
<i>Introivo ad altare dei.</i>

439
00:32:20,367 --> 00:32:22,597
<i>Ad deum que letifican juventuten mean.</i>

440
00:32:23,727 --> 00:32:27,197
I am very pleased today to announce
a new addition to our staff...

441
00:32:27,327 --> 00:32:30,683
Father Michael McKinnon,
comes to us from London, England.

442
00:32:31,127 --> 00:32:33,516
He'll be in charge of our charity
programs for the poor.

443
00:32:33,927 --> 00:32:36,047
I would encourage you all
to introduce yourselves...

444
00:32:36,527 --> 00:32:38,995
and to make Father Michael feel at home.

445
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,765
Jesus tells us...

446
00:32:41,687 --> 00:32:43,086
<i>I watched Arthur Barret...</i>

447
00:32:43,487 --> 00:32:47,366
<i>like a competitor sizes up his opponent.</i>

448
00:32:49,087 --> 00:32:52,636
<i>But I found myself,</i>
<i>drawn to Eleanor instead.</i>

449
00:32:54,287 --> 00:32:56,517
<i>And as unimportant and</i>
<i>trivial as it seemed then...</i>

450
00:32:57,527 --> 00:33:01,236
<i>that's what I remember most about</i>
<i>the first time I saw Arthur Barret.</i>

451
00:33:10,847 --> 00:33:13,998
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Arthur.

452
00:33:14,127 --> 00:33:16,087
- Good morning, Eleanor.
- Good morning, Father.

453
00:33:16,088 --> 00:33:19,163
- I enjoyed your sermon very much.
- It was a fine mass, as always.

454
00:33:19,367 --> 00:33:21,517
- Thank you.
- Father McKinnon...

455
00:33:21,727 --> 00:33:25,083
it gives me pleasure to introduce two
of my favorite people in the world...

456
00:33:25,287 --> 00:33:27,482
Arthur Barret and his wife Eleanor.

457
00:33:28,887 --> 00:33:31,082
Welcome. I'm delighted
to have you joining us...

458
00:33:31,167 --> 00:33:33,362
my wife is particularly glad.

459
00:33:34,327 --> 00:33:36,921
Indeed. I'm a firm believer
in the charity program.

460
00:33:37,087 --> 00:33:39,999
In that case, I would appreciate
any advice you have to offer.

461
00:33:40,607 --> 00:33:43,519
- Why don't you come by our house...?
- Tuesday.

462
00:33:43,687 --> 00:33:46,247
Tuesday.
We'll have dinner and discuss it.

463
00:33:47,367 --> 00:33:48,720
Tuesday sounds delightful.

464
00:33:48,847 --> 00:33:52,760
I will need to check the
parish diary. May I call you?

465
00:33:53,087 --> 00:33:56,363
I warn you, she'll talk
fundraising all night.

466
00:33:56,447 --> 00:33:59,007
Only if my husband will let me
get a word in edgewise.

467
00:34:01,727 --> 00:34:03,206
Please remember, Father...

468
00:34:03,447 --> 00:34:05,915
there can be no more important
event on your diary...

469
00:34:06,287 --> 00:34:08,243
than an invitation from the Barrets.

470
00:34:08,367 --> 00:34:10,562
- If you know what I mean.
- Of course, Father.

471
00:34:25,207 --> 00:34:27,926
Did you really expect
a miracle the first time?

472
00:34:28,527 --> 00:34:30,404
Somehow I honestly think I did.

473
00:34:33,127 --> 00:34:34,879
What am I going to tell Arthur?

474
00:34:35,327 --> 00:34:36,521
Tell him the truth.

475
00:34:37,967 --> 00:34:39,844
Tell him you have to try again.

476
00:34:44,527 --> 00:34:45,562
How can I?

477
00:35:02,887 --> 00:35:03,956
Arthur.

478
00:35:06,407 --> 00:35:09,001
- I thought you were working today.
- I was.

479
00:35:10,247 --> 00:35:14,559
- I've started my period.
- I'm sorry.

480
00:35:15,327 --> 00:35:16,885
How can you be so understanding?

481
00:35:18,767 --> 00:35:21,725
- What would you have me say?
- Something.

482
00:35:22,607 --> 00:35:25,167
Anything other than ask me if I was
alright the morning after.

483
00:35:25,327 --> 00:35:27,927
- You never said a word about it.
- I try not to think about it.

484
00:35:27,928 --> 00:35:29,399
It's a painful subject for me.

485
00:35:30,327 --> 00:35:32,887
I try to focus instead on
what will come of this...

486
00:35:33,327 --> 00:35:34,601
our child.

487
00:35:37,247 --> 00:35:38,521
You're so good.

488
00:35:44,127 --> 00:35:46,127
I want you to know that
I did not and wouldn't...

489
00:35:46,647 --> 00:35:49,320
- kiss him like that.
- Eleanor, please.

490
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:51,207
Just let me say it.
I wanted to tell you...

491
00:35:51,447 --> 00:35:53,324
how lonely that night was for me...

492
00:35:53,407 --> 00:35:56,285
how I tried to imagine your face...

493
00:35:56,367 --> 00:35:59,279
- and body.
- I know. I was lonely too.

494
00:36:03,207 --> 00:36:05,038
I wanted to ask, but...

495
00:36:06,007 --> 00:36:10,080
I couldn't bear to hear one detail.
I'm not that strong.

496
00:36:10,207 --> 00:36:12,084
You're stronger than I ever imagined.

497
00:36:12,967 --> 00:36:16,960
No, I hand picked that man for this...

498
00:36:18,847 --> 00:36:21,042
when he left our house that morning...

499
00:36:21,887 --> 00:36:23,400
I hated him.

500
00:36:24,767 --> 00:36:27,406
Him? Or was it me you hated?

501
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:30,436
I hated him...

502
00:36:32,407 --> 00:36:34,557
for being able to give you
what I never can.

503
00:36:37,527 --> 00:36:39,438
I suppose I will always...

504
00:36:41,207 --> 00:36:42,526
hate him for that...

505
00:36:45,167 --> 00:36:46,964
as much as I will envy him.

506
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:51,765
I'll call Hannibal in the morning.

507
00:37:25,887 --> 00:37:26,956
Roger?

508
00:37:28,047 --> 00:37:29,366
What are you doing?

509
00:37:31,887 --> 00:37:33,206
Come up, please.

510
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:39,439
- Is something wrong Mrs. Barret?
- Well yes. What are you doing?

511
00:37:39,967 --> 00:37:41,719
I'm trying to make love to you.

512
00:37:44,367 --> 00:37:45,436
I'm very flattered...

513
00:37:45,487 --> 00:37:49,878
but this is not what this is about.
We should both remember that.

514
00:37:50,007 --> 00:37:52,601
- My husband is my lover.
- Him?

515
00:37:52,927 --> 00:37:55,287
How can he be a lover to you
when he can't even get it up?

516
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,926
Arthur is sterile, Roger, not impotent.

517
00:38:01,007 --> 00:38:02,725
Well, same difference?

518
00:38:02,927 --> 00:38:05,202
He still can't be a whole man to you.

519
00:38:08,367 --> 00:38:10,437
I think I finally have you figured out.

520
00:38:11,607 --> 00:38:13,359
- You have?
- Yes.

521
00:38:13,647 --> 00:38:15,205
I've been reading your novel.

522
00:38:16,967 --> 00:38:19,276
"If we face the fact that we go alone...

523
00:38:20,447 --> 00:38:22,287
and that we belong to
the world of reality...

524
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:23,766
not only to men and women...

525
00:38:24,887 --> 00:38:27,355
then the dead poet that was
Shakespeare's sister...

526
00:38:27,767 --> 00:38:30,486
will put on the body she
so often laid down."

527
00:38:33,007 --> 00:38:34,156
Virginia Woolf.

528
00:38:34,647 --> 00:38:36,367
You quoted her in the preface of your book.

529
00:38:37,047 --> 00:38:38,844
It's dedicated to her.

530
00:38:40,847 --> 00:38:45,875
She's talking about a day when women
will be recognized as equal to men?

531
00:38:45,967 --> 00:38:49,596
I think she's talking about a day
when gender won't matter.

532
00:38:50,367 --> 00:38:52,562
But Shakespeare didn't
really have a sister, did he?

533
00:38:53,607 --> 00:38:54,722
It's a metaphor.

534
00:38:57,687 --> 00:38:58,915
Still...

535
00:38:59,047 --> 00:39:04,167
you don't believe the sister would be
capable of the same sort of genius?

536
00:39:04,327 --> 00:39:07,922
Given the same opportunities,
yes. I think she could.

537
00:39:08,167 --> 00:39:10,840
Yes. And speaking of opportunities...

538
00:39:17,567 --> 00:39:18,920
I think I love you, Mrs. Barret.

539
00:39:19,047 --> 00:39:22,517
- Oh God! Where did that come from?
- I think about you constantly.

540
00:39:23,167 --> 00:39:24,486
Constantly.

541
00:39:25,727 --> 00:39:26,842
Does that bother you?

542
00:39:26,927 --> 00:39:29,202
- It concerns me, yes.
- Why?

543
00:39:29,727 --> 00:39:31,843
Because I don't want you
to be hurt by this.

544
00:39:35,567 --> 00:39:37,683
I was thinking, perhaps we could...

545
00:39:38,527 --> 00:39:39,960
prolong our arrangement...

546
00:39:40,087 --> 00:39:42,840
if I was to withdraw early
every now and then.

547
00:39:45,687 --> 00:39:48,201
What have we done to you Roger Martin?

548
00:39:50,447 --> 00:39:52,563
Your husband has made me very rich...

549
00:39:53,607 --> 00:39:55,359
and you have made me very happy.

550
00:39:55,807 --> 00:39:59,880
- Roger...
- I don't expect you to love me back.

551
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:03,840
But you should know that
when we do this tonight...

552
00:40:05,207 --> 00:40:06,560
I won't be having sex.

553
00:40:08,807 --> 00:40:10,320
I'll be making love.

554
00:40:19,527 --> 00:40:23,486
<i>Her decision to remain beneath him</i>
<i>was the biggest mistake of her life.</i>

555
00:40:24,327 --> 00:40:26,887
<i>For though she understood</i>
<i>those ramifications...</i>

556
00:40:27,407 --> 00:40:30,126
<i>it was suddenly clear to her</i>
<i>that Roger Martin did not.</i>

557
00:40:31,087 --> 00:40:34,523
<i>She felt she could bear</i>
<i>risking her own soul...</i>

558
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,160
<i>to have a child this way...</i>

559
00:40:36,727 --> 00:40:39,161
<i>but now another person's</i>
<i>spirituality was involved.</i>

560
00:40:40,487 --> 00:40:42,447
<i>Shrouding this event</i>
<i>in business was supposed...</i>

561
00:40:42,448 --> 00:40:43,883
<i>to relieve such danger...</i>

562
00:40:44,407 --> 00:40:46,159
<i>but Roger Martin professed love.</i>

563
00:40:47,207 --> 00:40:49,482
<i>She closed her eyes and tried</i>
<i>not to think about it...</i>

564
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:52,846
<i>but even in darkness...</i>

565
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:55,965
<i>one thing was as clear Eleanor</i>
<i>as the light of day...</i>

566
00:40:56,687 --> 00:40:59,997
<i>she now felt responsible</i>
<i>for Roger's unrequited love.</i>

567
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:10,316
Take a deep breath now.

568
00:41:10,487 --> 00:41:12,603
Exhale. Good.

569
00:41:12,727 --> 00:41:13,842
Excellent.

570
00:41:26,927 --> 00:41:28,485
Congratulations, Mrs. Barret.

571
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:31,996
Is there anything you can do
about this wretched nausea?

572
00:41:33,007 --> 00:41:35,157
Not much.
Light tea and soda crackers.

573
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:38,842
Try not to get too hungry
or overeat. Just munch.

574
00:41:39,527 --> 00:41:42,087
I had no idea being pregnant
was so difficult.

575
00:41:42,207 --> 00:41:44,118
Some of my patients tell me...

576
00:41:45,247 --> 00:41:48,125
that being pregnant is much more
difficult than getting that way.

577
00:41:48,407 --> 00:41:49,556
That's what you think?

578
00:41:51,487 --> 00:41:52,556
Beg your pardon?

579
00:42:05,687 --> 00:42:06,756
Well?

580
00:42:08,447 --> 00:42:09,436
She'll be fine.

581
00:42:12,847 --> 00:42:14,405
Harold. Out with it.

582
00:42:16,047 --> 00:42:19,119
Yes, Arthur. Your wife
is definitely with child.

583
00:42:19,327 --> 00:42:20,601
Congratulations.

584
00:42:21,687 --> 00:42:22,961
Good Arthur.

585
00:42:46,247 --> 00:42:47,646
Syril, could you get that!

586
00:42:56,527 --> 00:42:57,755
- I'll get it.
- Oh, thanks.

587
00:42:58,167 --> 00:43:00,203
- Barret Residence.
<i>- Mrs. Barret, please.</i>

588
00:43:00,567 --> 00:43:03,684
Mr. Martin, I'm sorry but
Mrs. Barret is indisposed.

589
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:07,356
- Would you leave another message?
<i>- No, I would talk to her.</i>

590
00:43:07,447 --> 00:43:09,563
<i>I'm tired of this obvious brush off.</i>

591
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:11,962
- Mr. Martin...
<i>- And don't Mr. Martin me.</i>

592
00:43:12,087 --> 00:43:15,204
<i>I know my rights, she's carrying my baby.</i>

593
00:43:18,167 --> 00:43:21,477
I suggest you leave
Mrs. Barret alone, Mr. Martin...

594
00:43:22,047 --> 00:43:23,605
and never call this house again.

595
00:43:23,727 --> 00:43:25,638
- Do you understand?
<i>- How dare you?</i>

596
00:43:25,727 --> 00:43:28,287
It's breaking his heart.
I should talk to him.

597
00:43:28,447 --> 00:43:29,567
You should do no such thing.

598
00:43:29,887 --> 00:43:33,675
It'll only aggravate the situation by
showing his persistence will pay off.

599
00:43:34,007 --> 00:43:36,999
Let Arthur take care of it.
He'll know what to do.

600
00:43:42,007 --> 00:43:45,443
- Excuse me, you wanted to see me.
- Yes, come along.

601
00:43:45,647 --> 00:43:49,003
- How long have you been with us?
- Nearly four months sir.

602
00:43:49,167 --> 00:43:51,920
- Why, sir?
- I spoke with Arthur Barret and he...

603
00:43:52,047 --> 00:43:56,325
asked me to express his regrets that
you're unable to adjust your agenda...

604
00:43:56,487 --> 00:43:59,207
- so you can have dinner with him.
- That's very thoughtful of him.

605
00:43:59,927 --> 00:44:01,121
You're missing the point.

606
00:44:02,127 --> 00:44:05,802
When you arrived at St. Jude,
did I not make myself clear...

607
00:44:06,487 --> 00:44:09,559
as to exactly how I felt about
the Barrets and their importance.

608
00:44:09,967 --> 00:44:12,197
- You did, Father.
- Then, I can only assume...

609
00:44:12,367 --> 00:44:16,155
since you are a bright man with
a promising future in the Church...

610
00:44:16,327 --> 00:44:19,603
that for the past 4 months you've
not been trying to dodge them...

611
00:44:19,887 --> 00:44:23,038
but rather you've been engaged
in one life or death situation...

612
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,920
after another and have had
no choice but to cancel.

613
00:44:26,687 --> 00:44:30,236
Fortunately, Mr. Barret
is a patient man...

614
00:44:30,927 --> 00:44:34,397
and has now asked if they can adjust
their schedule to yours.

615
00:44:34,487 --> 00:44:36,557
You're invited to dinner next week.

616
00:44:38,887 --> 00:44:40,843
Which night would that be, sir?

617
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:44,724
Whatever night he chooses.

618
00:44:45,847 --> 00:44:47,439
- Is that clear?
- Perfectly.

619
00:44:47,647 --> 00:44:48,636
Good.

620
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:33,087
<i>The Barret estate was magnificent...</i>

621
00:45:33,967 --> 00:45:36,481
<i>but it could not compete</i>
<i>with my father's house.</i>

622
00:45:46,838 --> 00:45:49,398
Mr. and Mrs. Barret this has been
a really wonderful evening...

623
00:45:49,482 --> 00:45:51,442
thank you so much for
sharing your home with me.

624
00:45:51,443 --> 00:45:52,203
You're not leaving?

625
00:45:52,204 --> 00:45:55,124
- It's still early.
- He's right, please stay longer.

626
00:45:55,847 --> 00:45:57,917
You're very kind, thank you.

627
00:45:58,807 --> 00:46:00,684
<i>If ever humility was lost</i>

628
00:46:00,807 --> 00:46:02,445
<i>in a moment of weakness...</i>

629
00:46:03,167 --> 00:46:04,236
<i>this was it.</i>

630
00:46:05,887 --> 00:46:09,482
They say that Wall Street
will never be the same.

631
00:46:09,607 --> 00:46:11,643
You're the financial expert.
Do you agree?

632
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:15,198
I agree that long range investment
will never be the same.

633
00:46:16,727 --> 00:46:19,082
Americans want to take
their profits quickly...

634
00:46:19,567 --> 00:46:21,364
they'll never stay in for the long haul.

635
00:46:22,127 --> 00:46:25,915
So then it makes sense that large
sums of American investment money...

636
00:46:25,967 --> 00:46:27,320
have found their way to Germany.

637
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:30,882
<i>Every instinct should have told me</i>
<i>leave well enough alone...</i>

638
00:46:30,967 --> 00:46:33,845
<i>but alas, foolish pride won out.</i>

639
00:46:34,247 --> 00:46:37,717
<i>I was sliding down a path</i>
<i>I could not resist.</i>

640
00:46:37,887 --> 00:46:40,959
- The Nazis, huh?
- Yes. I'm afraid so.

641
00:46:41,447 --> 00:46:46,202
You appear to be an astute student
of the investment game, Father.

642
00:46:46,287 --> 00:46:49,723
If I may be so bold, where
do you get your information?

643
00:46:49,887 --> 00:46:51,366
From a select few who...

644
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:54,719
have already invested in Germany
rather than Wall St.

645
00:46:54,767 --> 00:46:57,998
- No. Name one.
- Samuel Barret.

646
00:47:07,447 --> 00:47:08,516
What is this?

647
00:47:09,367 --> 00:47:10,436
Arthur don't!

648
00:47:10,887 --> 00:47:11,956
Arthur please!

649
00:47:13,007 --> 00:47:16,477
No. Come on, the charade is over.
This is about something else.

650
00:47:16,607 --> 00:47:19,724
You've led this conversation to
that name. I demand to know why?

651
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:22,127
I didn't intend to come her and
have this conversation...

652
00:47:22,176 --> 00:47:24,856
but I do know that you hate your
older brother and he hates you...

653
00:47:24,857 --> 00:47:26,817
- What business is that of yours?
- I'm his son.

654
00:47:30,167 --> 00:47:31,316
Excuse me.

655
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:34,196
Mr. Barret, there's
a problem developing.

656
00:47:34,247 --> 00:47:36,807
- What is it?
- I think you should just come.

657
00:47:37,047 --> 00:47:38,162
Please, sir.

658
00:47:46,727 --> 00:47:49,560
- I demand to see her right now!
- What the devil is going on here?

659
00:47:49,767 --> 00:47:52,327
I'm here to see Mrs...
to see Eleanor...

660
00:47:52,647 --> 00:47:55,115
and if you don't let me through
I will force my way through.

661
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:56,919
- Is that so?
- I mean it.

662
00:48:01,087 --> 00:48:03,078
Well, Father...

663
00:48:04,287 --> 00:48:07,723
you've proven a fascinating guest,
next you'll not even be a priest.

664
00:48:07,847 --> 00:48:08,916
I am a priest.

665
00:48:09,967 --> 00:48:12,162
If you're really a Barret,
why do you go by McKinnon?

666
00:48:12,447 --> 00:48:15,207
I took it when I entered the Church.
It was my mother's maiden name.

667
00:48:17,127 --> 00:48:19,047
Why couldn't you just be
honest from the start?

668
00:48:19,087 --> 00:48:22,363
Because from the start,
I've been trying to avoid...

669
00:48:23,007 --> 00:48:23,996
all of this.

670
00:48:25,367 --> 00:48:28,837
I'd heard a great deal about
Arthur Barret, mostly bad.

671
00:48:30,167 --> 00:48:34,126
I couldn't resist seeing
for myself if it was true.

672
00:48:35,207 --> 00:48:36,401
Stuff your money!

673
00:48:36,487 --> 00:48:38,796
I haven't been able
to see her or talk to her.

674
00:48:38,887 --> 00:48:41,606
I think at the least I deserve
to see the mother of my own child.

675
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:43,240
What you deserve you have received.

676
00:48:43,367 --> 00:48:45,437
Now you will collect yourself.

677
00:48:45,607 --> 00:48:47,086
You will honor your contract...

678
00:48:47,167 --> 00:48:50,443
you will return to your automobile,
which my money purchased no doubt...

679
00:48:50,567 --> 00:48:53,035
and you will never set foot here
again or so help me God...

680
00:48:53,087 --> 00:48:54,076
What will you do?

681
00:48:54,167 --> 00:48:57,876
Expose me as the father
of your pregnant wife's child?

682
00:48:58,207 --> 00:49:00,243
I suggest you think again
Mr. Barret...

683
00:49:00,407 --> 00:49:03,240
or you may just expose yourself
as your wife's pimp.

684
00:49:04,207 --> 00:49:06,562
Wouldn't that be a presidential
piece of gossip.

685
00:49:14,167 --> 00:49:18,160
If you ever threaten me again,
or approach my wife...

686
00:49:18,727 --> 00:49:21,639
or try to lay claim
to our child, I will kill you.

687
00:49:23,287 --> 00:49:24,515
Do you understand me?

688
00:49:41,527 --> 00:49:43,279
I'm sorry. Everything is alright.

689
00:49:45,087 --> 00:49:49,956
As for you, Father McKinnon,
or whatever your real name is...

690
00:49:51,607 --> 00:49:54,360
I am in no state of mind now
to deal with your motives...

691
00:49:54,407 --> 00:49:56,557
or those of my brother,
who obviously sent you here.

692
00:49:56,647 --> 00:50:00,879
But I will expect a full explanation
from you when next we meet.

693
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:02,839
- Mr. Barret.
- Leave my house!

694
00:50:03,847 --> 00:50:05,326
Or I will have you thrown out.

695
00:50:05,967 --> 00:50:06,956
Mrs. Barret.

696
00:50:25,167 --> 00:50:26,202
Arthur.

697
00:50:27,087 --> 00:50:28,566
Try not to worry...

698
00:50:30,087 --> 00:50:31,156
I will deal with this.

699
00:50:34,727 --> 00:50:36,957
Maybe I should talk to Roger
try to reason with him.

700
00:50:37,047 --> 00:50:39,038
That would be useless.

701
00:50:40,847 --> 00:50:42,121
He's in love with you.

702
00:50:45,727 --> 00:50:48,764
And he's threatening to expose us.

703
00:50:50,207 --> 00:50:53,483
- That would destroy us.
- It certainly would, and he knows it.

704
00:51:01,807 --> 00:51:02,876
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hannibal...

705
00:51:04,407 --> 00:51:06,762
our problem has gotten worse...

706
00:51:06,927 --> 00:51:10,283
Martin was just here.
He won't let go of it.

707
00:51:19,447 --> 00:51:21,438
Did you know that Sam
and Julia had a child?

708
00:51:24,607 --> 00:51:25,801
I knew.

709
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:37,962
Father McKinnon!

710
00:51:39,687 --> 00:51:41,962
- Mrs. Barret?
- May I speak with you a moment?

711
00:51:42,247 --> 00:51:43,316
Certainly.

712
00:51:44,567 --> 00:51:45,967
Does your husband know you're here?

713
00:51:45,968 --> 00:51:48,202
- Certainly not.
- Then, why are you here?

714
00:51:48,407 --> 00:51:50,687
Because I love him Father and
I protect the ones I love.

715
00:51:50,688 --> 00:51:51,676
I don't understand.

716
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:53,647
It should be quite obvious.

717
00:51:54,047 --> 00:51:55,927
Arthur is one of the
president's key advisors.

718
00:51:55,928 --> 00:51:59,396
What if the press finds out that
his brother is a Nazi sympathizer?

719
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,756
- I'm very worried about a scandal.
- A Nazi sympathizer?

720
00:52:02,927 --> 00:52:06,886
- I said my father was that?
- You implied it.

721
00:52:07,127 --> 00:52:08,685
Well, you have no need to worry...

722
00:52:08,727 --> 00:52:12,117
money and sympathy are two very
different things for my father.

723
00:52:12,407 --> 00:52:16,320
He'd invest in the devil if he could
reap his profits before Judgment Day.

724
00:52:16,367 --> 00:52:18,835
Believe me your husband's
reputation is very secure.

725
00:52:20,927 --> 00:52:23,167
The other night you said things
didn't go as planned...

726
00:52:23,207 --> 00:52:26,722
- Now is how you'd hoped they'd go?
- I apologize for the other night...

727
00:52:26,927 --> 00:52:28,076
Father Michael.

728
00:52:31,167 --> 00:52:34,125
- I'm sorry, may we discuss...
- How thoughtless of me.

729
00:52:34,487 --> 00:52:36,637
This is one of the distressing aspects...

730
00:52:36,807 --> 00:52:38,763
of our obligations to the poor.

731
00:52:40,127 --> 00:52:41,242
Did you know them?

732
00:52:41,527 --> 00:52:43,279
No, it's a paupers cemetery.

733
00:52:43,527 --> 00:52:45,757
Most of the people who find
their way in here...

734
00:52:45,887 --> 00:52:48,640
don't have even names to leave
behind them, much less friends.

735
00:52:49,727 --> 00:52:53,242
Unless you care to be
a friend to one of them.

736
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:58,403
- Yes. If I may.
- Certainly.

737
00:53:00,487 --> 00:53:03,001
Does their anonymity make your
job more bearable, Father?

738
00:53:03,167 --> 00:53:06,796
I honestly don't know. I'm not sure
if it's a blessing or a curse.

739
00:53:06,927 --> 00:53:07,996
How so?

740
00:53:08,287 --> 00:53:12,439
I can never forget a face that
I've put into one of these graves...

741
00:53:13,287 --> 00:53:16,597
but I find I can easily forget those.

742
00:53:17,007 --> 00:53:19,805
Makes me wonder if Our Lord
has a selective memory also?

743
00:53:20,167 --> 00:53:21,233
You know what he said...

744
00:53:21,234 --> 00:53:23,754
it's easier for a camel to pass
through the eye of a needle...

745
00:53:23,836 --> 00:53:25,316
than for a rich man to get to heaven.

746
00:53:25,317 --> 00:53:27,397
I'm not sure it's even that
complicated in my case.

747
00:53:28,527 --> 00:53:30,995
I think it's just God's way
of keeping me humble.

748
00:53:31,647 --> 00:53:33,717
What do you think?
Is it working?

749
00:53:34,767 --> 00:53:37,042
If you have to ask,
you already know the answer.

750
00:53:37,567 --> 00:53:39,000
Father, excuse me.

751
00:53:39,527 --> 00:53:41,563
- Thank you, Andre.
- Yes, Father.

752
00:54:16,047 --> 00:54:17,400
Look out Mrs. Barret!

753
00:54:20,847 --> 00:54:23,156
Andre, get Father Dryer.
Quickly!

754
00:54:42,087 --> 00:54:43,156
Arthur.

755
00:54:46,247 --> 00:54:47,521
It's not good.

756
00:54:47,927 --> 00:54:50,760
She's suffered a massive hemorrhage.
She's lost a lot of blood.

757
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:53,285
- And the baby?
- No...

758
00:54:53,847 --> 00:54:55,439
The baby was crushed in the fall.

759
00:54:56,847 --> 00:54:58,439
Good news is...

760
00:54:58,687 --> 00:55:01,997
She's come through the hardest part.
Tonight will tell the whole story.

761
00:55:02,647 --> 00:55:04,638
- Does she know about the baby?
- Yes.

762
00:55:06,007 --> 00:55:07,076
Well, finally.

763
00:55:07,287 --> 00:55:10,279
She's been asking for a priest.
You're Father McKinnon?

764
00:55:11,487 --> 00:55:14,285
- Why no...
- That would be me.

765
00:55:14,487 --> 00:55:18,036
She's been asking for you
ever since she came to.

766
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:21,407
I don't think she'll allow herself
to rest until she's spoken with you.

767
00:55:22,407 --> 00:55:25,763
- Is the baby alright?
- No, our baby is lost.

768
00:55:35,087 --> 00:55:36,884
None of this would have happened...

769
00:55:37,287 --> 00:55:40,836
if you had not come here. She had
no business going to that cemetery.

770
00:55:40,927 --> 00:55:43,487
- It was an accident.
- No business!

771
00:55:44,687 --> 00:55:45,881
Damn you!

772
00:56:18,287 --> 00:56:19,356
Mrs. Barret.

773
00:56:20,687 --> 00:56:22,598
It's Father Michael.
I'm here.

774
00:56:32,647 --> 00:56:35,957
- It's my fault.
- No, it was an accident.

775
00:56:37,007 --> 00:56:38,440
Father, listen...

776
00:56:39,407 --> 00:56:41,079
it was all my fault.

777
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:43,359
What are you talking about?

778
00:56:46,567 --> 00:56:47,886
What do you mean?

779
00:56:50,567 --> 00:56:52,603
I fear he did it.

780
00:56:53,287 --> 00:56:54,402
Did what?

781
00:56:55,447 --> 00:56:56,721
Murder.

782
00:57:03,967 --> 00:57:07,084
- What are we looking for, Father?
- I don't know exactly.

783
00:57:07,247 --> 00:57:09,397
By the looks of him,
he ain't been dead long.

784
00:57:09,527 --> 00:57:11,087
- Where'd he come from?
- Your office.

785
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:13,078
He was in the room where the
paupers are put.

786
00:57:13,207 --> 00:57:14,435
This one ain't ours.

787
00:57:14,687 --> 00:57:18,282
My associate's been out all week,
I've been pulling both shifts...

788
00:57:18,367 --> 00:57:20,087
- I'd have seen him.
- I don't understand.

789
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:22,960
We found him in the room in this
box toe tagged, "nameless".

790
00:57:23,127 --> 00:57:24,845
No, this ain't state built.

791
00:57:25,447 --> 00:57:27,517
We stencil "coroner" on our coffins.

792
00:57:27,647 --> 00:57:29,807
Keeps the employees from stealing
them for fire wood.

793
00:57:29,808 --> 00:57:31,365
Are you absolutely sure about this?

794
00:57:31,567 --> 00:57:34,161
Yeah. I'd remember this one
if I did him alright.

795
00:57:34,287 --> 00:57:36,517
Just look. His tongue is
still all swelled up.

796
00:57:36,607 --> 00:57:37,596
What does that mean?

797
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:43,045
It means that unless
this gentleman ate rat poison...

798
00:57:43,367 --> 00:57:44,487
the poor devil was murdered.

799
00:58:05,487 --> 00:58:07,842
Arthur wants to see you
before he leaves this morning.

800
00:58:07,967 --> 00:58:11,357
Tell him I'm not feeling well.
Just tell him.

801
00:58:20,127 --> 00:58:21,321
I'm sorry, Arthur.

802
00:58:25,007 --> 00:58:27,043
How long can this go on?

803
00:58:32,207 --> 00:58:33,242
No.

804
00:58:34,767 --> 00:58:36,758
She cannot hide from me any longer.

805
00:58:39,007 --> 00:58:40,486
How dare you barge in here?

806
00:58:41,127 --> 00:58:42,196
Eleanor...

807
00:58:43,247 --> 00:58:45,207
has it come to this,
that you're hiding from me?

808
00:58:46,447 --> 00:58:48,563
Are you frightened of me?

809
00:58:49,167 --> 00:58:51,920
- Should I be, Arthur?
- How can you say such a thing?

810
00:58:51,967 --> 00:58:56,358
Do you think I'm angry with you
for going to see that priest?

811
00:58:56,567 --> 00:58:59,798
I don't know anything anymore,
especially about you.

812
00:59:03,527 --> 00:59:05,085
My God. You think I did it?

813
00:59:09,007 --> 00:59:10,042
Did you?

814
00:59:12,687 --> 00:59:14,086
Did you kill him?

815
00:59:14,887 --> 00:59:16,206
Damn you for asking.

816
00:59:24,647 --> 00:59:26,365
I won't be controlled.
You understand?

817
00:59:26,967 --> 00:59:29,327
I will leave you if you don't tell me
the truth right now!

818
00:59:29,927 --> 00:59:31,042
Leave me?

819
00:59:32,887 --> 00:59:35,082
Where will you go?
You have no property of your own.

820
00:59:35,207 --> 00:59:36,435
I'll find a place.

821
00:59:36,687 --> 00:59:39,440
Will this new home match the beauty
of the home we've created here?

822
00:59:39,527 --> 00:59:40,596
It doesn't matter.

823
00:59:40,807 --> 00:59:42,687
- Will this new home have servants?
- Stop it!

824
00:59:42,688 --> 00:59:45,724
Who will draw your bath with
its bubbles from Paris?

825
00:59:45,847 --> 00:59:47,678
Speaking of Paris, will you travel?

826
00:59:47,767 --> 00:59:49,644
- Don't push me, Arthur!
- Pushing is it?

827
00:59:49,727 --> 00:59:51,957
Pushing to ask you how you
will make your living?

828
00:59:52,087 --> 00:59:55,045
- I'll write, of course.
- We both know what women earn.

829
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:59,085
Especially female intellectuals...

830
00:59:59,367 --> 01:00:01,756
concerned with women's rights.

831
01:00:01,847 --> 01:00:04,077
You'll write, but you'll
do laundry to survive!

832
01:00:04,127 --> 01:00:06,595
Fine. I'd rather starve
than sell my soul!

833
01:00:10,567 --> 01:00:12,080
Now that you mention it...

834
01:00:13,487 --> 01:00:15,523
Where will you go to worship God?

835
01:00:15,647 --> 01:00:19,799
You might own Father Dryer, but you
don't own me. I'll find another Church.

836
01:00:20,127 --> 01:00:21,879
Not as a catholic you won't.

837
01:00:23,767 --> 01:00:26,884
Don't you understand? I will
never ask the Church for a divorce.

838
01:00:27,087 --> 01:00:30,636
I will never give you up.
How can you think that?

839
01:00:46,967 --> 01:00:48,400
Stay with me, Eleanor.

840
01:00:54,327 --> 01:00:56,761
In your heart of hearts
you know that I am innocent.

841
01:00:58,807 --> 01:01:02,117
All I've ever done in the name
of sin was to love you...

842
01:01:04,807 --> 01:01:05,796
more than God.

843
01:01:27,207 --> 01:01:28,322
Alright, Arthur.

844
01:01:30,847 --> 01:01:32,724
- You won't leave me?
- No.

845
01:01:35,927 --> 01:01:38,122
I swear, Eleanor,
you'll believe in me again.

846
01:01:40,807 --> 01:01:42,160
I believe, Arthur...

847
01:01:44,327 --> 01:01:46,921
I believe whatever
happened to our marriage...

848
01:01:47,407 --> 01:01:51,320
and to Roger Martin, was
probably my fault to begin with.

849
01:01:57,687 --> 01:02:01,441
<i>It did not occur to Arthur that he</i>
<i>should try to relieve her guilt...</i>

850
01:02:01,567 --> 01:02:05,082
<i>or offer to share the blame</i>
<i>nor did it occur to Eleanor...</i>

851
01:02:05,207 --> 01:02:07,647
<i>that she had just committed</i>
<i>the same mistake as all women...</i>

852
01:02:07,648 --> 01:02:09,199
<i>since the beginning of time.</i>

853
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:11,967
<i>She had not only forgiven a man his ways...</i>

854
01:02:12,007 --> 01:02:14,840
<i>but had taken responsibility</i>
<i>for them as well.</i>

855
01:02:15,047 --> 01:02:19,279
<i>She closed her eyes</i>
<i>and said goodbye to her female God.</i>

856
01:02:32,047 --> 01:02:33,195
You did what?

857
01:02:33,196 --> 01:02:35,476
I asked the police to talk
to Arthur Barret, that's all.

858
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:38,320
I thought you should know in the
event that he mentioned it to you.

859
01:02:38,411 --> 01:02:40,651
Forgive me, Father Michael,
for what I am about to say.

860
01:02:41,207 --> 01:02:45,598
Are you out of your mind?
You are standing there saying...

861
01:02:45,767 --> 01:02:49,476
that you have involved one of the
most influential Catholics in Boston...

862
01:02:49,647 --> 01:02:51,717
not to mention one of our parishioners...

863
01:02:51,767 --> 01:02:54,520
in a murder investigation
without provocation?

864
01:02:54,727 --> 01:02:59,562
- The police say there are suspicious...
- I see, the police tell you.

865
01:03:00,047 --> 01:03:02,927
Have you taken a personal interest
in the persecution of Arthur Barret?

866
01:03:02,928 --> 01:03:03,676
Of course not.

867
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:06,116
Come with me.

868
01:03:08,807 --> 01:03:11,685
Do you know who bought
his headstone, his plot?

869
01:03:11,767 --> 01:03:13,598
Arthur Barret.
And that coffin?

870
01:03:13,887 --> 01:03:17,118
- Why would he do this for a stranger?
- Because he is a generous man.

871
01:03:17,327 --> 01:03:19,636
Which is why he has also
paying for the funeral...

872
01:03:19,687 --> 01:03:21,996
and for the proper
preparation of the body...

873
01:03:22,287 --> 01:03:25,165
and for the new suit that
this poor stinking corpse...

874
01:03:25,287 --> 01:03:28,324
- that you dug up is now wearing.
- Well, he's a hell of a guy, sir.

875
01:03:28,647 --> 01:03:31,525
How astute of you, Father Michael.
Now I ask you...

876
01:03:31,687 --> 01:03:34,007
- are these the acts of a murderer?
- I don't know yet...

877
01:03:34,008 --> 01:03:37,008
- but in fairness to Roger Martin...
- Whatever she told you that night...

878
01:03:37,009 --> 01:03:39,489
- you will treat like a confession.
- It wasn't a confession.

879
01:03:39,532 --> 01:03:41,132
And if you pursue this matter further...

880
01:03:41,133 --> 01:03:43,880
I will bring charges against you
for the violation of that trust...

881
01:03:43,927 --> 01:03:46,760
and I will have you removed from
Arthur Barret's congregation.

882
01:03:47,207 --> 01:03:49,767
- Arthur Barret's congregation?
- Yes. His more than yours.

883
01:03:49,887 --> 01:03:52,526
- Do I make myself clear?
- Perfectly, sir.

884
01:03:53,847 --> 01:03:57,522
There's another piece of information
which may come to light.

885
01:03:57,807 --> 01:03:58,922
Well, let me guess...

886
01:03:59,127 --> 01:04:02,005
you're a protestant heretic
sent here to ruin my life.

887
01:04:03,927 --> 01:04:05,997
Worse, I'm Arthur Barret's nephew.

888
01:04:16,607 --> 01:04:18,563
- Mrs. Barret.
- Good afternoon, Father.

889
01:04:18,647 --> 01:04:21,798
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- I'm surprised you're here at all.

890
01:04:22,447 --> 01:04:25,359
Arthur left for Germany last week.
I've had a million things to do.

891
01:04:26,567 --> 01:04:30,116
You've heard by now, Roger Martin's
death has been labeled a suicide.

892
01:04:30,687 --> 01:04:32,200
- Yes.
- Tell me...

893
01:04:32,367 --> 01:04:35,165
that night at the hospital, were you
offering me your confession?

894
01:04:35,567 --> 01:04:38,127
I think it was a bad dream.
I was delirious.

895
01:04:38,527 --> 01:04:40,040
Delirious enough to tell the truth?

896
01:04:42,407 --> 01:04:44,687
How can you tolerate that?
She's obviously Arthur's spy.

897
01:04:44,767 --> 01:04:46,325
Syril is more than a spy.

898
01:04:46,487 --> 01:04:49,126
She was a ragged street urchin.
Your grandmother took her in...

899
01:04:49,167 --> 01:04:51,367
and educated and refined her.
She helped raise Arthur.

900
01:04:52,967 --> 01:04:56,357
- The Barrets made her a somebody.
- In a word: yes.

901
01:04:56,487 --> 01:04:59,365
And she's protected our privileges
zealously ever since.

902
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:02,487
Can't say I blame her, she knows
what it's like not to have anything.

903
01:05:02,488 --> 01:05:04,561
It's strange that my father
never mentioned her.

904
01:05:05,247 --> 01:05:07,363
- Your father was in love with her.
- What?

905
01:05:07,567 --> 01:05:10,445
Of course Sam wouldn't marry her.
You know the Barret way.

906
01:05:10,647 --> 01:05:13,445
So instead, he ran off with
Arthur's fiancée.

907
01:05:13,847 --> 01:05:15,326
Julia McKinnon.

908
01:05:16,687 --> 01:05:19,918
- My mother was engaged to Arthur?
- Yes.

909
01:05:20,487 --> 01:05:23,445
The brothers had a terrible fight
and parted ways forever.

910
01:05:25,327 --> 01:05:27,602
But for Syril and Arthur
a partnership was formed.

911
01:05:28,167 --> 01:05:30,044
They protect each other to this very day.

912
01:05:30,287 --> 01:05:32,407
So you've known all along
who you were dealing with.

913
01:05:33,127 --> 01:05:36,085
- That makes sense.
- Nothing makes sense anymore.

914
01:05:37,887 --> 01:05:39,605
I've come to you on faith.

915
01:05:47,767 --> 01:05:49,485
- Do you like horses?
- Yes.

916
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:52,321
I'm well enough to ride again.

917
01:05:52,447 --> 01:05:55,803
I usually take my exercise by
the old mill pond, do you know it?

918
01:05:57,367 --> 01:05:58,482
I do, yes.

919
01:06:00,127 --> 01:06:03,164
Was it naive to believe that I could
contend with a man such as Arthur?

920
01:06:03,527 --> 01:06:06,997
- With Arthur no, his power yes.
- How do you separate them?

921
01:06:07,207 --> 01:06:11,166
I don't know. But it's predictable
that one should ask the question.

922
01:06:17,967 --> 01:06:20,487
Did you know it's possible for
someone who's reached heaven...

923
01:06:20,488 --> 01:06:22,128
to fall back through the eye of a needle.

924
01:06:26,327 --> 01:06:27,555
I do now.

925
01:07:11,167 --> 01:07:13,806
- It's such a beautiful day.
- Indeed it is.

926
01:07:15,207 --> 01:07:17,721
Do you think Roger Martin knows
it's a beautiful day too?

927
01:07:18,407 --> 01:07:19,886
Well, you don't waste much time.

928
01:07:20,967 --> 01:07:23,567
I assume you've come all the way
out here to hear my confession.

929
01:07:23,568 --> 01:07:24,761
You assumed wrong.

930
01:07:25,847 --> 01:07:28,645
I've come out here
to be your friend. Really.

931
01:07:39,127 --> 01:07:41,482
He was more than an acquaintance.

932
01:07:43,327 --> 01:07:46,319
- Are you saying you had an affair?
- No.

933
01:07:47,407 --> 01:07:52,925
Arthur can't have children.
So we hired Mr. Martin as a surrogate.

934
01:07:54,407 --> 01:07:57,922
You mean that he and you...?

935
01:07:58,447 --> 01:07:59,960
More than once, I'm afraid.

936
01:08:00,887 --> 01:08:03,879
But finally we were successful
and our business was finished.

937
01:08:04,367 --> 01:08:05,356
Business?

938
01:08:06,447 --> 01:08:09,962
- Does that term offend you?
- I don't know yet.

939
01:08:10,247 --> 01:08:11,316
Go on.

940
01:08:12,887 --> 01:08:14,036
Well, that's it.

941
01:08:15,567 --> 01:08:17,080
I became pregnant, and...

942
01:08:18,887 --> 01:08:20,764
Roger thought that he fell in love with me.

943
01:08:20,807 --> 01:08:23,799
He wouldn't quit.
He threatened to expose Arthur...

944
01:08:24,127 --> 01:08:27,244
- and claim the baby.
- So Arthur had to ki...

945
01:08:28,007 --> 01:08:29,326
I'm sorry.

946
01:08:30,647 --> 01:08:33,081
- That came out all wrong.
- I just need to know why.

947
01:08:34,007 --> 01:08:37,158
- Why would he have to kill him?
- It's you, Eleanor.

948
01:08:38,687 --> 01:08:42,885
You're the one person in the world
he respects enough to fear.

949
01:08:44,847 --> 01:08:46,644
Love's enough to kill for.

950
01:08:47,327 --> 01:08:49,443
Why?
What gives me this power?

951
01:08:51,487 --> 01:08:53,205
Forgive me. I have to go.

952
01:08:53,247 --> 01:08:56,842
Where are you going?
You can't leave me hanging like this.

953
01:08:57,047 --> 01:09:00,596
I'm so sorry but I do have a job,
or rather a vocation.

954
01:09:00,967 --> 01:09:02,844
I'm scheduled to hear confessions.

955
01:09:03,967 --> 01:09:07,846
But I have to admit nothing will top this.

956
01:09:22,367 --> 01:09:24,676
- Hello?
<i>- Hello Michael.</i>

957
01:09:25,087 --> 01:09:27,999
<i>- Is it a bad time?</i>
- Is this a bad time?

958
01:09:29,607 --> 01:09:30,835
Who is this?

959
01:09:31,567 --> 01:09:34,320
This is Eleanor.
You left me hanging today...

960
01:09:34,527 --> 01:09:37,519
I figured if you cost me sleep
I could at least pay you back.

961
01:09:38,647 --> 01:09:41,400
Considered yourself paid in full.

962
01:09:43,607 --> 01:09:45,727
Why do I get the feeling
you're not all caught up...

963
01:09:45,728 --> 01:09:47,046
in the ritual of religion?

964
01:09:47,167 --> 01:09:49,647
You were never once judgmental
as I was telling you my story.

965
01:09:49,687 --> 01:09:52,520
You mean like a good priest would have?

966
01:09:52,687 --> 01:09:54,803
<i>Yes, exactly like that.</i>

967
01:09:55,407 --> 01:09:58,160
Well, because...

968
01:09:58,447 --> 01:10:01,041
<i>my God does not live exclusively</i>
<i>in the Church.</i>

969
01:10:01,167 --> 01:10:02,646
<i>You know, he goes fishing.</i>

970
01:10:02,927 --> 01:10:04,804
<i>He has the occasional headache.</i>

971
01:10:04,927 --> 01:10:06,201
He stubs his toe sometimes.

972
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:10,525
But I don't think that
He blames us for being human.

973
01:10:11,847 --> 01:10:13,200
Then why a priest?

974
01:10:14,327 --> 01:10:16,966
Because my father couldn't buy the company.

975
01:10:23,327 --> 01:10:24,999
My God used to be a she.

976
01:10:25,927 --> 01:10:29,636
Used to be? Right.
And was she pretty?

977
01:10:31,087 --> 01:10:32,122
I don't know...

978
01:10:32,487 --> 01:10:35,206
but it is predictable that
you would ask that question.

979
01:10:35,727 --> 01:10:36,796
"Touché".

980
01:10:41,127 --> 01:10:44,563
So out with it Michael, what gives
with this power over Arthur?

981
01:10:46,567 --> 01:10:48,558
I got to go. I'm sorry.
Bye.

982
01:10:50,727 --> 01:10:54,083
Eleanor, are you awake?

983
01:11:13,287 --> 01:11:17,883
<i>Splendid. I'm wide awake</i>
<i>and there was nothing to do.</i>

984
01:11:19,447 --> 01:11:21,517
<i>It was going to be a very long night.</i>

985
01:11:30,607 --> 01:11:34,839
- Has she gone to him everyday?
- Yes.

986
01:11:37,007 --> 01:11:38,406
Is she with him now?

987
01:11:38,887 --> 01:11:40,115
I believe so.

988
01:11:52,007 --> 01:11:54,157
- Are they lovers?
- No.

989
01:11:55,727 --> 01:11:58,287
But I predict if this
continues they will be.

990
01:12:05,647 --> 01:12:08,445
I lost her.
Just like Julia.

991
01:12:08,567 --> 01:12:11,559
Damn it, Syril.
Tell me what to do.

992
01:12:13,407 --> 01:12:15,238
Decide what you want.

993
01:12:16,807 --> 01:12:18,035
And live with that.

994
01:12:19,887 --> 01:12:21,798
I want Eleanor...

995
01:12:24,647 --> 01:12:26,638
but I want a child too.

996
01:12:27,327 --> 01:12:28,885
Then they should be lovers.

997
01:12:31,527 --> 01:12:35,202
Finish it, Arthur.
Allow her to give birth to this baby.

998
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:36,396
Your baby.

999
01:12:37,167 --> 01:12:39,442
Isn't what all of this was
about in the first place?

1000
01:12:40,167 --> 01:12:42,806
I can't remember what
this was about anymore.

1001
01:12:44,607 --> 01:12:46,643
But this does change things now.

1002
01:12:48,607 --> 01:12:49,676
And you know it.

1003
01:12:50,407 --> 01:12:51,726
But for the better.

1004
01:12:53,807 --> 01:12:56,605
- Now a true Barret will be born.
- I can't.

1005
01:12:58,687 --> 01:13:02,316
I saw how happy you were when
Eleanor was carrying that child.

1006
01:13:04,447 --> 01:13:06,881
The baby will bring you
back together again.

1007
01:13:07,527 --> 01:13:11,315
- All she needs is a push.
- You have pushed enough.

1008
01:13:18,007 --> 01:13:20,521
Now, get out.

1009
01:13:27,447 --> 01:13:28,846
Don't worry, Arthur.

1010
01:13:53,767 --> 01:13:57,043
I can't stay very long, Arthur's home.

1011
01:13:59,407 --> 01:14:00,999
Was his trip successful?

1012
01:14:04,567 --> 01:14:06,717
No. He said he won't do
business with the devil.

1013
01:14:13,207 --> 01:14:15,846
Does that mean he's a man
of good conscience again?

1014
01:14:18,967 --> 01:14:20,366
Is that unbearable for you.

1015
01:14:22,807 --> 01:14:27,039
Arthur and I are like strangers
on a very large elevator.

1016
01:14:27,207 --> 01:14:31,120
We hug the walls, trying to
politely avoid each other.

1017
01:14:39,247 --> 01:14:41,317
What do you suppose God does
on a rainy day?

1018
01:14:42,927 --> 01:14:45,395
I think She probably
catches up on her reading.

1019
01:14:50,487 --> 01:14:51,761
Thank you for that.

1020
01:15:57,807 --> 01:15:59,207
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry. It's me.

1021
01:16:01,607 --> 01:16:02,881
No. It's both of us.

1022
01:16:10,807 --> 01:16:12,081
What now, Eleanor?

1023
01:16:18,607 --> 01:16:20,086
Now we say goodbye.

1024
01:16:30,367 --> 01:16:31,800
Bless me, Father...

1025
01:16:34,407 --> 01:16:35,726
I confess...

1026
01:16:37,047 --> 01:16:39,163
to God Almighty...

1027
01:16:40,127 --> 01:16:41,560
and to you Father...

1028
01:16:44,527 --> 01:16:46,165
that I have sinned.

1029
01:17:18,007 --> 01:17:19,884
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

1030
01:17:24,407 --> 01:17:28,719
I said, Bless me Father, for I have sinned.

1031
01:17:29,327 --> 01:17:30,316
Syril?

1032
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:32,716
What are you doing here?

1033
01:17:33,007 --> 01:17:35,680
- I'm trying to confess.
- You're not even a catholic.

1034
01:17:36,087 --> 01:17:38,396
- All the more reason to confess.
- Confess to what?

1035
01:17:39,327 --> 01:17:41,204
A mutual friend of ours has sinned...

1036
01:17:42,567 --> 01:17:44,125
and is about to sin again.

1037
01:17:44,247 --> 01:17:47,000
- What?
- You heard me, Father.

1038
01:17:48,407 --> 01:17:50,238
- When?
- Tonight.

1039
01:19:05,847 --> 01:19:07,075
What was that?

1040
01:19:08,127 --> 01:19:11,722
The storm might have blown
a window open, I'll see to it.

1041
01:19:12,647 --> 01:19:13,966
Syril, I can't do this.

1042
01:19:15,407 --> 01:19:18,205
- What are you talking about?
- I won't do this again.

1043
01:20:12,247 --> 01:20:15,717
Mr. Harrington to see Mrs. Barret.
I believe she's expecting me.

1044
01:20:16,407 --> 01:20:18,238
You're late Mr. Harrington...

1045
01:20:18,487 --> 01:20:19,886
possibly too late.

1046
01:20:51,207 --> 01:20:52,401
Eleanor?

1047
01:21:07,167 --> 01:21:09,681
Who is it?
Michael, what...?

1048
01:21:23,407 --> 01:21:27,525
- Eleanor, are you alright?
- Yes.

1049
01:21:28,687 --> 01:21:30,200
- Can I come in?
- No...

1050
01:21:31,967 --> 01:21:33,559
I'm not feeling well right now.

1051
01:21:36,127 --> 01:21:39,119
But your young man is here.
He's waiting downstairs.

1052
01:21:42,447 --> 01:21:47,601
Send him my apologies
and tell him we have to postpone.

1053
01:22:29,327 --> 01:22:32,239
<i>Syril sat by the window</i>
<i>in darkness all night...</i>

1054
01:22:32,527 --> 01:22:35,724
<i>watching the elements,</i>
<i>considering their source.</i>

1055
01:22:36,207 --> 01:22:38,801
<i>Appreciating the power of their fury.</i>

1056
01:22:40,167 --> 01:22:41,441
<i>More than once...</i>

1057
01:22:41,567 --> 01:22:43,364
<i>as thunder rolled and lighting</i>

1058
01:22:43,447 --> 01:22:46,405
<i>streaked across Arthur Barret's</i>
<i>lawn, she smiled...</i>

1059
01:22:46,567 --> 01:22:49,639
<i>and relished the similarities</i>
<i>of secrets and storms.</i>

1060
01:22:49,847 --> 01:22:52,998
<i>The bigger they are,</i>
<i>the more dangerous they become.</i>

1061
01:23:24,247 --> 01:23:25,919
- For you Father.
- Andre.

1062
01:23:31,287 --> 01:23:34,085
Would you take care of this?

1063
01:23:39,607 --> 01:23:43,282
Rome? I don't understand.
Why are you doing this to me.

1064
01:23:43,727 --> 01:23:46,002
Because I've just had a chat
with Eleanor Barret.

1065
01:23:46,567 --> 01:23:47,886
Need I say more.

1066
01:23:49,167 --> 01:23:51,283
She's waiting in the sanctuary
to say goodbye.

1067
01:23:58,247 --> 01:23:59,805
How kind you came to say goodbye.

1068
01:23:59,847 --> 01:24:01,883
- It's best.
- For you or for me?

1069
01:24:01,967 --> 01:24:03,767
- For us both.
- I didn't ask for your help.

1070
01:24:03,834 --> 01:24:05,794
I thought what happened
was strictly between us.

1071
01:24:05,795 --> 01:24:06,795
- It was.
- You think...

1072
01:24:06,796 --> 01:24:09,036
I'll fall apart like Roger,
unable to live without you?

1073
01:24:09,087 --> 01:24:11,078
Not me, your child.

1074
01:24:12,007 --> 01:24:13,326
I'm pregnant.

1075
01:24:13,887 --> 01:24:14,922
What?

1076
01:24:15,927 --> 01:24:17,804
I'm going to have a baby.

1077
01:24:18,687 --> 01:24:19,881
It's your baby.

1078
01:24:24,447 --> 01:24:25,482
My baby.

1079
01:24:30,367 --> 01:24:32,164
But will it ever be Arthur's baby.

1080
01:24:37,767 --> 01:24:40,122
Don't you see? Women don't
own things. We don't know how.

1081
01:24:40,207 --> 01:24:42,487
We're talking about a human soul.
Nobody can own a baby.

1082
01:24:43,967 --> 01:24:46,007
When a young woman out
of wedlock gets pregnant...

1083
01:24:46,051 --> 01:24:48,291
what's the first question
her father asks her? Who's...

1084
01:24:48,292 --> 01:24:50,122
- That's just a phrase.
- It's the truth!

1085
01:24:51,087 --> 01:24:54,159
How will you feel when you baptize
your child in Arthur's arms?

1086
01:24:54,287 --> 01:24:58,405
How's he going to feel when you lay
his hand on his head at communion?

1087
01:24:58,607 --> 01:25:02,077
Please, don't blame me for trying
to protect him from that.

1088
01:25:04,527 --> 01:25:06,567
You've fallen in love
with him again, haven't you?

1089
01:25:08,007 --> 01:25:09,076
Haven't you, Eleanor?

1090
01:25:11,047 --> 01:25:14,722
I lost my way, but not my faith.

1091
01:25:14,847 --> 01:25:16,326
Well aren't you the fortunate one.

1092
01:25:17,727 --> 01:25:20,844
- You don't mean that.
- Of course I mean it! Look at this!

1093
01:25:21,519 --> 01:25:23,879
I threw away my father's life
when I entered the Church...

1094
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:25,920
I compromised my judgment
when I came to Boston...

1095
01:25:25,921 --> 01:25:28,121
and threw away my conscience
that night in your house.

1096
01:25:28,122 --> 01:25:29,842
I will face the consequences with my God...

1097
01:25:29,887 --> 01:25:33,562
but please, Eleanor,
don't have me sent away.

1098
01:25:35,167 --> 01:25:36,395
Let me face God here.

1099
01:25:36,487 --> 01:25:39,479
Look, the baby will be yours and Arthur's.

1100
01:25:39,607 --> 01:25:41,120
I will lay no claims upon it.

1101
01:25:41,167 --> 01:25:44,204
- Don't make this child your sacrifice.
- It won't be my sacrifice.

1102
01:25:44,727 --> 01:25:46,285
But it might just be...

1103
01:25:46,527 --> 01:25:47,721
my salvation.

1104
01:26:12,807 --> 01:26:14,286
What about Father Dryer?

1105
01:26:15,567 --> 01:26:18,320
He's a good priest but he runs a business.

1106
01:26:19,687 --> 01:26:22,565
Just convince him it's my soul
you're buying not his.

1107
01:26:25,847 --> 01:26:28,759
You want to threaten him
with Arthur's money?

1108
01:26:29,927 --> 01:26:30,996
Yes.

1109
01:26:42,727 --> 01:26:44,479
Very well, Father McKinnon.

1110
01:26:46,727 --> 01:26:48,160
Together we stand.

1111
01:26:52,887 --> 01:26:55,003
In our witness to our faith in God...

1112
01:26:55,127 --> 01:26:57,960
and a commitment to the work
of the Kingdom on Earth.

1113
01:26:58,007 --> 01:27:00,521
Such a call can be frightening
and daunting...

1114
01:27:00,647 --> 01:27:03,207
<i>How does one tell the tale of healing?</i>

1115
01:27:04,127 --> 01:27:06,038
<i>Or measure progress from within?</i>

1116
01:27:06,767 --> 01:27:10,077
<i>True to his honor, Arthur kept</i>
<i>his promise to Eleanor...</i>

1117
01:27:11,127 --> 01:27:13,960
<i>as ever so patiently, day by day...</i>

1118
01:27:15,127 --> 01:27:17,846
<i>he set out to mend her troubled heart.</i>

1119
01:27:23,087 --> 01:27:25,521
<i>She in turn gave him access.</i>

1120
01:27:28,047 --> 01:27:30,322
<i>Through it all one thing is certain...</i>

1121
01:27:30,687 --> 01:27:33,281
<i>their focus never changed.</i>

1122
01:27:33,807 --> 01:27:37,561
<i>For just as they thought a baby</i>
<i>would make their lives complete...</i>

1123
01:27:37,727 --> 01:27:41,561
<i>they now felt sure</i>
<i>it would turn their lives around.</i>

1124
01:28:11,687 --> 01:28:12,967
Father Michael!
Father Michael!

1125
01:28:17,247 --> 01:28:19,920
- Come please.
- What is it, Andre?

1126
01:28:23,847 --> 01:28:25,166
- Hello?
- <i>Who is this?</i>

1127
01:28:25,407 --> 01:28:26,681
Father McKinnon.
Who is this?

1128
01:28:27,007 --> 01:28:29,237
Dr. Jenkins.
Where is Father Dryer?

1129
01:28:29,367 --> 01:28:31,247
He's out of town,
at a conference. What is it?

1130
01:28:31,327 --> 01:28:34,956
I'm at the Barret estate,
Mrs. Barret is in a very bad way.

1131
01:28:35,167 --> 01:28:38,637
- It's barely been 8 months.
- She asked for Father Dryer.

1132
01:28:38,967 --> 01:28:41,117
<i>You best come quickly in his stead Father.</i>

1133
01:28:52,927 --> 01:28:55,646
- What's happening?
- She woke up in great pain...

1134
01:28:55,807 --> 01:28:59,163
she thought her water broke.
It was blood, another hemorrhage.

1135
01:29:00,327 --> 01:29:02,966
- And the baby?
- So far, they're alive.

1136
01:29:03,287 --> 01:29:05,403
- They?
- Twins. That's the trouble.

1137
01:29:05,487 --> 01:29:08,718
The uterus was damaged in a fall.
The stress of two is too much.

1138
01:29:09,047 --> 01:29:10,480
She might not make it.

1139
01:29:21,087 --> 01:29:22,361
Eleanor.

1140
01:29:25,607 --> 01:29:27,598
Which God do you bring me today?

1141
01:29:28,807 --> 01:29:30,206
Which God would you like?

1142
01:29:30,927 --> 01:29:32,076
Today...

1143
01:29:33,287 --> 01:29:36,359
- I'd like the perfect One.
- You shall have him.

1144
01:29:39,167 --> 01:29:41,681
I'm sorry, Michael, I didn't want you to...

1145
01:29:42,327 --> 01:29:43,521
Save your strength.

1146
01:29:50,247 --> 01:29:51,362
What will you do?

1147
01:29:52,327 --> 01:29:53,362
What?

1148
01:29:55,927 --> 01:29:59,317
What will you do with
the babies now that I'm dead?

1149
01:30:03,607 --> 01:30:04,676
Doctor!

1150
01:30:06,607 --> 01:30:09,246
Eleanor, can you hear me?

1151
01:30:13,287 --> 01:30:14,481
She's unconscious.

1152
01:30:16,207 --> 01:30:18,562
- Tell me what you want Arthur?
- What?

1153
01:30:19,647 --> 01:30:21,046
Oh for God's sake!

1154
01:30:24,047 --> 01:30:26,322
She's gone and there's nothing I can do.

1155
01:30:28,047 --> 01:30:30,481
Tell me what to do about the babies?

1156
01:30:32,887 --> 01:30:36,436
She's gone!
Now. I need to know now!

1157
01:30:39,647 --> 01:30:40,966
Eleanor! Wake up.

1158
01:30:42,167 --> 01:30:44,283
Tell me what to do.
I can't do this without you.

1159
01:30:44,447 --> 01:30:47,325
- Arthur, the babies need your help.
- Do it.

1160
01:30:52,887 --> 01:30:54,161
Tell him. Tell him.

1161
01:30:57,847 --> 01:31:00,805
- Doctor, just do it.
- Stay close father...

1162
01:31:01,167 --> 01:31:02,282
I'll need your help.

1163
01:31:15,967 --> 01:31:17,286
Aspirate him Father.

1164
01:31:18,967 --> 01:31:21,435
- How?
- Set him down quickly.

1165
01:31:22,127 --> 01:31:24,800
Take your little finger and
scoop out his mouth.

1166
01:31:27,007 --> 01:31:29,646
- He's not breathing.
- Tilt his head back.

1167
01:31:29,807 --> 01:31:33,083
Breathe into his mouth.
Don't blow too hard.

1168
01:31:41,847 --> 01:31:43,041
That's it.

1169
01:31:49,767 --> 01:31:51,120
Doctor this isn't working!

1170
01:31:51,647 --> 01:31:52,796
It's not working?

1171
01:31:53,167 --> 01:31:55,283
- Help him.
- I'll take care of it.

1172
01:31:55,367 --> 01:31:57,597
It's alright.
It's alright.

1173
01:32:04,927 --> 01:32:06,121
Well Arthur...

1174
01:32:07,287 --> 01:32:08,720
you have twin sons.

1175
01:32:28,047 --> 01:32:30,356
Once again you have
my deep condolences, Arthur.

1176
01:32:31,327 --> 01:32:32,646
And my congratulations.

1177
01:32:33,367 --> 01:32:34,641
She was a fine woman.

1178
01:32:35,647 --> 01:32:36,875
Thank you, Harold.

1179
01:32:38,567 --> 01:32:39,920
You've done a good thing here.

1180
01:32:41,407 --> 01:32:44,683
As for you Father McKinnon, many thanks.

1181
01:32:51,167 --> 01:32:52,520
I intend to come back for them.

1182
01:32:56,567 --> 01:32:57,795
I will fight you.

1183
01:32:58,127 --> 01:33:01,722
They're mine Arthur.
Eleanor told Father Dryer.

1184
01:33:03,807 --> 01:33:05,399
- He'll never admit that.
- No...

1185
01:33:07,167 --> 01:33:08,486
but Syril knows the truth.

1186
01:33:10,607 --> 01:33:12,563
Tell him I was with her that night...

1187
01:33:13,807 --> 01:33:15,320
that you allowed me to stay.

1188
01:33:17,927 --> 01:33:18,916
Tell him.

1189
01:33:28,527 --> 01:33:30,961
Is there nothing I can say?
Is there nothing I can do?

1190
01:33:31,247 --> 01:33:34,398
No. If you challenge me,
I'll expose it all.

1191
01:33:38,647 --> 01:33:43,118
- Michael, please.
- There will be no negotiation.

1192
01:33:44,807 --> 01:33:48,516
I'll go back to England after
her funeral, I'll get a governess.

1193
01:33:49,567 --> 01:33:51,080
They can stay with Syril until then.

1194
01:33:55,807 --> 01:33:58,082
You bastard.
You are just like him.

1195
01:34:53,247 --> 01:34:56,364
<i>I had come to have my moment</i>
<i>alone with Eleanor.</i>

1196
01:34:56,847 --> 01:34:57,882
Arthur.

1197
01:34:58,807 --> 01:35:00,081
We'll be alright.

1198
01:35:03,647 --> 01:35:06,445
<i>I often wonder how different</i>
<i>my life would be now...</i>

1199
01:35:06,647 --> 01:35:10,162
<i>if I had made them aware</i>
<i>of my presence a moment sooner.</i>

1200
01:35:12,007 --> 01:35:13,565
Why did you do it, Syril?

1201
01:35:20,367 --> 01:35:22,483
Why did you kill that young man?

1202
01:35:26,047 --> 01:35:27,082
Arthur, no.

1203
01:35:27,127 --> 01:35:30,961
Roger came to see Eleanor
that night, didn't he?

1204
01:35:33,527 --> 01:35:36,724
- No.
- Didn't he?

1205
01:35:43,327 --> 01:35:44,362
Yes.

1206
01:35:47,567 --> 01:35:49,000
You were at the theater.

1207
01:35:50,647 --> 01:35:52,399
He was going to destroy you.

1208
01:35:53,487 --> 01:35:56,160
- I had to protect you.
- Protect me?

1209
01:35:56,287 --> 01:35:58,926
Yes. He was beside himself.

1210
01:35:59,607 --> 01:36:04,044
He was screaming he'd expose you
the next day. I lied.

1211
01:36:07,047 --> 01:36:09,481
I told him she was in the bath and to wait.

1212
01:36:09,607 --> 01:36:11,279
I gave him a drink of whiskey.

1213
01:36:12,767 --> 01:36:14,280
Laced with arsenic?

1214
01:36:14,887 --> 01:36:18,004
I did it for you. To save you.

1215
01:36:18,967 --> 01:36:20,036
Save me?

1216
01:36:22,247 --> 01:36:23,919
You have killed me.

1217
01:36:26,247 --> 01:36:27,680
I have nothing now.

1218
01:36:31,927 --> 01:36:33,155
Absolutely nothing.

1219
01:36:45,367 --> 01:36:47,597
I love you like my own son.

1220
01:36:49,807 --> 01:36:51,206
I know.

1221
01:36:54,047 --> 01:36:55,560
Believe me, I know.

1222
01:37:01,727 --> 01:37:03,399
Now give me...

1223
01:37:05,247 --> 01:37:07,807
one last moment alone with my wife.

1224
01:37:24,487 --> 01:37:25,476
I'll love forever.

1225
01:37:34,007 --> 01:37:35,725
Arthur... sir...

1226
01:37:38,927 --> 01:37:41,760
May I ask, what you just said to her?

1227
01:37:42,527 --> 01:37:44,279
Please, I do so need to know.

1228
01:37:45,167 --> 01:37:46,236
Why?

1229
01:37:47,127 --> 01:37:49,243
Because she deserved so much...

1230
01:37:50,567 --> 01:37:52,398
and because, too late...

1231
01:37:53,327 --> 01:37:55,238
and to my eternal shame...

1232
01:37:56,527 --> 01:37:58,324
I see how much you deserve.

1233
01:38:00,567 --> 01:38:01,920
Please, tell me.

1234
01:38:05,727 --> 01:38:07,160
Only the truth...

1235
01:38:10,687 --> 01:38:12,405
that she would never be forgotten.

1236
01:38:17,287 --> 01:38:19,403
I said there would be no negotiation...

1237
01:38:21,567 --> 01:38:24,365
but if I may, I should like
to make a bargain with you.

1238
01:38:26,567 --> 01:38:29,001
Oh God, whose goodness is
always to have mercy...

1239
01:38:29,087 --> 01:38:30,236
and to spare...

1240
01:38:30,287 --> 01:38:33,996
we humbly beseech Thee, that the
soul of Thy servant, Eleanor...

1241
01:38:34,087 --> 01:38:37,875
whom Thou hast this day
commanded to depart this world...

1242
01:39:39,327 --> 01:39:40,646
<i>I said goodbye to Eleanor...</i>

1243
01:39:41,607 --> 01:39:43,802
<i>knowing that now she</i>
<i>would always be with me...</i>

1244
01:39:46,247 --> 01:39:48,363
<i>I would never forget her face.</i>

1245
01:40:21,487 --> 01:40:25,082
You needn't feel guilty for this.
The sun shines here too.

1246
01:40:26,287 --> 01:40:27,766
I don't feel guilty Michael.

1247
01:40:31,407 --> 01:40:33,557
She might have appreciated
it more your way.

1248
01:40:33,647 --> 01:40:34,682
Thank you.

1249
01:40:36,967 --> 01:40:38,923
Eleanor once told me...

1250
01:40:41,687 --> 01:40:43,405
that above all else...

1251
01:40:44,247 --> 01:40:49,367
Shakespeare's sister would have been
a humble, patient, forbearing soul.

1252
01:40:50,247 --> 01:40:52,203
Even after the way she was denied.

1253
01:40:54,927 --> 01:40:58,044
Especially because she was denied.

1254
01:41:33,327 --> 01:41:36,956
<i>Every Sunday Arthur would take</i>
<i>his place at that communion rail...</i>

1255
01:41:37,087 --> 01:41:40,762
<i>and stand proudly hand in hand</i>
<i>with his twin sons.</i>

1256
01:41:41,047 --> 01:41:43,117
May God always bless you, Hannibal.

1257
01:41:45,247 --> 01:41:46,967
<i>Then I would touch the head of the child...</i>

1258
01:41:47,007 --> 01:41:49,919
<i>whose very first breath</i>
<i>was drawn from my own.</i>

1259
01:41:50,247 --> 01:41:52,602
May God always bless you, Michael.

1260
01:41:55,287 --> 01:41:56,925
<i>He named him Michael.</i>

1261
01:41:58,007 --> 01:41:59,360
<i>Imagine that.</i>

1262
01:42:10,047 --> 01:42:12,197
<i>It does not escape my sense of irony...</i>

1263
01:42:12,287 --> 01:42:15,324
<i>to admit that yet another woman's story...</i>

1264
01:42:15,407 --> 01:42:17,682
<i>so clumsily told by a men...</i>

1265
01:42:17,847 --> 01:42:19,724
<i>has ended tragically.</i>

1266
01:42:20,047 --> 01:42:23,642
<i>Although the paths of our lives</i>
<i>may turn unexpectedly...</i>

1267
01:42:23,807 --> 01:42:25,923
<i>and end all too soon...</i>

1268
01:42:26,247 --> 01:42:28,647
<i>I can only believe that the journey</i>
<i>is never in vain and...</i>

1269
01:42:28,648 --> 01:42:30,757
<i>perhaps it is this very journey...</i>

1270
01:42:31,047 --> 01:42:33,561
<i>which gives life hope and meaning.</i>

1271
01:42:34,287 --> 01:42:37,597
<i>They say that a sinner</i>
<i>is someone who knows God...</i>

1272
01:42:37,727 --> 01:42:40,639
<i>and a priest is someone in search of Him.</i>

1273
01:42:41,647 --> 01:42:44,480
<i>I began to know God through Eleanor.</i>

1274
01:42:45,327 --> 01:42:48,444
<i>It was she, who taught me about faith.</i>
