and there's his special goal,
which is this peak called Meru.

for all kinds of reasons.

00:24:20,752 --> 00:24:25,131
But to Mugs, this didn't deter him.
This was- He is the cosmic climber...

304
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:28,301
and this is all part of the cosmic plan,
and he was gonna go back.

00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:39,974
But then Jimmy or Conrad
would launch into the void.

331
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:52,112
[Krakauer] You know, this is steep,
modern A4 E-climbing.

332
00:26:52,195 --> 00:26:54,447
It's using tools. You're a craftsman...

333
00:26:54,531 --> 00:26:56,741
tapping and pounding and tweaking.

334
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:58,868
And he's like this cabinetmaker...

335
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:02,288
chiseling away at this cabinet
out of walnut or something.

336
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:06,626
Except, you know, if you hit that chisel
one more time and you're a cabinetmaker...

337
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:09,629
maybe you split it and
you ruin this cabinet- bummer.

338
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:13,716
If on an A4 pitch, you,
like, split the cabinet, you die.

339
00:27:37,949 --> 00:27:40,076
Yeah, I'll tent right there.

340
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,078
Uh, you wanna be here? Where you wanna be?

341
00:27:42,162 --> 00:27:45,081
I don't care. I'm right on this edge.
I'll sit here for now.

342
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:47,458
I got some hot bevies.

343
00:27:47,542 --> 00:27:51,796
[Jimmy's Voice] It's hard to overstate
what kind of condition we were in.

344
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,674
Barely.
[Sighs]

345
00:27:54,757 --> 00:28:00,013
We're literally down to eating a couple
spoonfuls of granola in the morning...

346
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:03,349
and sharing a couple slices
of salami during the day...

347
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:04,934
with couple pieces of cheese.

348
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:09,063
I mean, we're definitely
on pretty limited rations at this point.

349
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:12,650
- [Conrad] Roasty.
- [Renan Chuckles]

350
00:28:13,985 --> 00:28:18,698
For climbers over a stove
on a half-empty jug of propane...

351
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:20,825
there's nothing finer
than roasting the rind.

352
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:23,494
It becomes quite tasty.

353
00:28:24,996 --> 00:28:28,958
[Jimmy] 'Cause basically eating
everything that you have left.

354
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:31,211
Super efficient.

355
00:28:31,294 --> 00:28:35,965
Next week, we'll be eating our boots.
[Chuckles]

356
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,639
[Metal Clinking]

357
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:55,401
[Krakauer] You know, Conrad talks a lot
about how to keep the risk manageable.

358
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:59,239
Talks about there's acceptable risk
and unacceptable risk.

359
00:28:59,322 --> 00:29:03,284
But he always keeps it on the acceptable
side by leaving this margin.

360
00:29:04,244 --> 00:29:05,745
Om, shanti.

361
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:09,832
[Krakauer Continues] But... you know,
he had tried this climb before...

362
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:13,503
failed, and even
if he didn't admit it to himself...

363
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:18,341
to succeed, he was gonna have to throw
that conservative stuff out the window...

364
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:20,760
and take mega-risk on this.

365
00:29:24,764 --> 00:29:27,267
But, you know,
if they want to stay alive...

366
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,602
they cannot fuck up at all.

367
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:33,856
And he talked about,
"If I die, I've really let down my family.

368
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,192
I cannot make any mistakes."

369
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:38,611
That's not good to be thinkin'
when you're that far out there.

370
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:42,365
He is thinkin', "Man, I cannot die now...

371
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:44,701
because then I've blown it
for my wife and kids."

372
00:29:46,911 --> 00:29:48,830
Jenni has no idea.

373
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:52,542
She has no fucking idea
what he is really doin' out there.

374
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:56,212
[Sighs]

375
00:30:01,676 --> 00:30:04,053
[Jimmy Sighs]

376
00:30:04,137 --> 00:30:06,014
Fuck.

377
00:30:06,097 --> 00:30:08,975
We're all just kind of frayed.

378
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:13,730
Sixteen days up here,
just givin' it everything we have.

379
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:16,691
It's been really slow.

380
00:30:17,775 --> 00:30:20,820
And, uh, we're running
out of fuel actually.

381
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:24,782
Um, and food. And cigarettes and papers.

382
00:30:24,866 --> 00:30:28,661
But tomorrow is kind of the decider.

383
00:30:28,745 --> 00:30:31,581
If we, uh...

384
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:34,751
don't get up and around
this big, steep headwall...

385
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:39,213
we're gonna have to
pull the cord, but, uh...

386
00:30:39,297 --> 00:30:42,759
we got one last push tomorrow.

387
00:30:45,428 --> 00:30:47,388
[Chuckles]

388
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:54,020
Jimmy's strength is that
he's very rational and accepting...

389
00:30:54,103 --> 00:30:56,272
and real in what we can do.

390
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,360
When we first met,
I realized right away...

391
00:31:00,443 --> 00:31:03,363
there was a mentorship
that was going to blossom.

392
00:31:03,446 --> 00:31:08,868
I also immediately sensed that
he was driven and determined.

393
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:12,246
- And I never really knew why.
- [Shutter Clicking]

394
00:31:12,914 --> 00:31:14,457
[Shutter Clicks]

395
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,210
My parents called me Xiao-pang.

396
00:31:17,293 --> 00:31:19,253
It means "Little Chub."

397
00:31:19,337 --> 00:31:24,175
[Jimmy's Voice] My parents had to escape
from China during the Communist Revolution.

398
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:25,968
They both went through a lot.

399
00:31:27,428 --> 00:31:30,390
They came to the United States
to make a new life.

400
00:31:30,473 --> 00:31:34,060
And I think they had
really high expectations for me.

401
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:37,939
My dad was a hard-ass.

402
00:31:38,022 --> 00:31:41,275
In the wintertime, we would get cords of
wood to heat the house.

403
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:44,278
And he'd put it in the back
of this huge yard we had...

404
00:31:44,362 --> 00:31:48,116
and make me drag it back
on a sled in thigh-deep snow.

405
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,286
He was really about being tough.

406
00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:56,666
Mountain climbing,
it wasn't a career to them.

407
00:31:56,749 --> 00:31:59,252
My mom used to call me all the time...

408
00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:03,047
and lament about the fact
her son was this homeless man...

409
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:07,093
who wandered around
and camped and didn't have a home.

410
00:32:07,176 --> 00:32:09,345
[Sizzling]

411
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:12,140
But when I went through
a difficult divorce...

412
00:32:12,223 --> 00:32:15,726
and called Jimmy, crying, upset...

413
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:19,772
his first words were, "Come stay with me."

414
00:32:19,856 --> 00:32:23,734
So, we just moved into his bachelor pad.

415
00:32:23,818 --> 00:32:26,737
Two kids, all their markers
and Legos. [Chuckles]

416
00:32:26,821 --> 00:32:27,821
Yeah.

417
00:32:27,864 --> 00:32:29,532
And he just took us right in.

418
00:32:33,202 --> 00:32:36,956
[Krakauer] You know, he's another one of
these extremely accomplished climbers.

419
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,499
You don't appreciate
how good a climber he is...

420
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:40,751
because
you get distracted by the art...

421
00:32:40,835 --> 00:32:43,463
which is probably the way he likes it.

422
00:32:43,546 --> 00:32:47,175
And taking pictures makes
the climbing Way harder.

423
00:32:47,258 --> 00:32:50,887
He was filming this Everest
expedition, and his morn got really sick.

424
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:55,308
And he found out about it and had to leave
so he could see her before she died.

425
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:03,065
[Jimmy] My mom had made me promise
fairly early on, she was like...

426
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:06,986
"If you're gonna make this your life,
you need to promise me one thing.

427
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:11,240
You have to promise me that
you will not die before me."

428
00:33:11,324 --> 00:33:14,327
And when I was on climbs
and on expeditions...

429
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:18,164
I would get to a certain point,
and I would say, "Okay.

430
00:33:18,247 --> 00:33:22,335
How close am I willing to go to
potentially break that promise?"

431
00:33:22,418 --> 00:33:25,755
So, after my mom died...

432
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:28,841
when the climbing
started to get into that place...

433
00:33:28,925 --> 00:33:34,180
I remember a moment being like,
"Well, I can go for it right now."

434
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:37,058
[Equipment Jingling]

435
00:33:43,314 --> 00:33:46,234
[Renan]
Conrad's up there. Can't find good gear.

436
00:33:47,276 --> 00:33:51,364
Our hands and feet are all frost-numb.

437
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:52,990
Nice, Rad.

438
00:33:53,658 --> 00:33:55,493
Good move.

439
00:33:55,576 --> 00:33:56,869
[Hammering]

440
00:33:56,953 --> 00:34:00,248
We're probably at about 20,500 feet.

441
00:34:00,331 --> 00:34:02,291
Just short of the ridge.

442
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:05,294
It's fucking Arctic.

443
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:09,257
Today's our summit bid.

444
00:34:17,557 --> 00:34:19,100
[Renan]
Bring it in.

445
00:34:20,434 --> 00:34:23,229
- [Conrad] Whoo!
- [Renan] Yeah, Rad!

446
00:34:23,312 --> 00:34:26,691
[Pebbles Rattle]

447
00:34:26,774 --> 00:34:28,568
Nice!

448
00:34:28,651 --> 00:34:31,862
[Krakauer] The game in climbing is cut
that line as fine as you can.

449
00:34:31,946 --> 00:34:34,323
But you don't want to take stupid risk.

450
00:34:34,407 --> 00:34:37,618
If you die taking a stupid risk,
not only are you dead...

451
00:34:37,702 --> 00:34:40,413
but you've embarrassed yourself
and you've disgraced yourself.

452
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:42,623
You're not supposed to take risk lightly.

453
00:34:42,707 --> 00:34:45,835
You're supposed to show
that you're so good and so controlled...

454
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,504
you can take it right to that line
and go no further.

455
00:34:48,588 --> 00:34:50,089
[Chuckles]

456
00:34:51,674 --> 00:34:55,261
[Jimmy] It's been a super long morning.
Started at 2:00.

457
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:58,014
Probably another 500 feet to the summit.

458
00:34:59,974 --> 00:35:02,268
[Jimmy's Voice]
We're gunning for the summit ridgeline...

459
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:07,315
and Conrad's burrowing through
this overhanging cornice.

460
00:35:07,398 --> 00:35:10,776
Renan is in the line of fire.

461
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,946
Snow and ice falling 150 feet...

462
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:16,449
just slamming Renan.

463
00:35:16,532 --> 00:35:19,785
[Renan] All the shrapnel and
the ice that he was kicking down...

464
00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:21,996
was going directly onto me-

465
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,623
like, constant deluge.

466
00:35:23,706 --> 00:35:28,127
And I could really feel
that I was losing my fingers and toes.

467
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:33,341
I started just screaming...
and yelling and crying.

468
00:35:33,424 --> 00:35:36,052
That was my absolute last breaking point.

469
00:35:36,135 --> 00:35:39,972
I even said something when I got up there,
like, "My feet aren't doing so well."

470
00:35:40,056 --> 00:35:43,184
They didn't even acknowledge what I said.

471
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:47,229
They were talking about
spending the night there.

472
00:35:49,482 --> 00:35:51,602
[Jimmy] Conrad and I are having
a conversation like...

473
00:35:51,651 --> 00:35:55,154
"Is there a spot to bivy? Is there a spot
for us to spend the night?"

474
00:35:55,237 --> 00:36:00,868
Trying to sleep perched
on this tiny little corner...

475
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:03,788
at 20,000 feet without sleeping bags...

476
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:07,083
and risk fingers and toes.

477
00:36:10,461 --> 00:36:12,922
[Jimmy]
What if we push on? Should we push on?

478
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:16,008
If you go for it
and you spend the night out...

479
00:36:16,092 --> 00:36:20,179
there's a probability
that's higher than you want...

480
00:36:20,262 --> 00:36:23,015
that you... aren't gonna come back.

481
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:28,979
Just shy of the summit.

482
00:36:29,063 --> 00:36:32,692
It's 4:00, and we're at 17 days.

483
00:36:32,775 --> 00:36:36,445
- We're fuckin' roasted.
- Started out this morning at midnight.

484
00:36:36,529 --> 00:36:40,491
If we go today and attempt to the summit,
that means we're gonna be out tonight...

485
00:36:40,574 --> 00:36:46,205
and an unplanned bivouac at 20,000 feet
in really cold climate...

486
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:49,959
without proper protection
and without sufficient food...

487
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:51,794
just doesn't make any sense.

488
00:36:56,298 --> 00:36:58,300
[Exhales]

489
00:37:06,934 --> 00:37:09,228
[Grunts]

490
00:37:09,311 --> 00:37:11,105
[Renan]
It's over.

491
00:37:11,188 --> 00:37:13,941
A hundred meters short of the summit.

492
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:16,777
We just don't have
the safety margin to make it.

493
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:23,617
It's not easy turning around. But-

494
00:37:23,701 --> 00:37:25,995
Fuck, this thing was an ass-kicker.

495
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:28,497

I've ever seen...

660
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:51,179
is Jimmy sitting upright.

661
00:48:51,263 --> 00:48:52,764
[Exhales Sharply]

662
00:48:52,848 --> 00:48:56,393
[Jimmy] I haven't seen a fuckin' slide-
[Chuckles]

663
00:49:01,148 --> 00:49:05,777
[Jeremy's Voice] This avalanche has
trumped all avalanches I've ever seen.

664
00:49:05,861 --> 00:49:09,197
I couldn't help but think, "Jimmy's dead."

665
00:49:10,365 --> 00:49:13,910
I just can't believe that he survived it.

666
00:49:13,994 --> 00:49:15,871
Oh, boy!

667
00:49:15,954 --> 00:49:17,664
- [Whines]
- Whoo!

668
00:49:17,747 --> 00:49:19,499
[Jeremy]
We just saw a miracle.

669
00:49:19,583 --> 00:49:21,543
[Xavier]
Yeah, they saw a miracle.

670
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:24,754
Or I saw superhuman effort.
I saw somethin'. I don't know.

671
00:49:31,303 --> 00:49:35,015
[Jimmy] Most people don't survive
those kinds of avalanches.

672
00:49:35,098 --> 00:49:37,642
People die in a lot lesser avalanches.

673
00:49:37,726 --> 00:49:39,895
So I got really lucky.

674
00:49:39,978 --> 00:49:42,481
Took off for a while.
I disappeared off the map...

675
00:49:42,564 --> 00:49:46,067
and I needed some time
to really contemplate.

676
00:49:48,445 --> 00:49:51,490
[Grace]
After Renan's near-death accident...

677
00:49:51,573 --> 00:49:53,575
Jimmy was extremely shaken.

678
00:49:53,658 --> 00:49:56,244
And then the avalanche four days later.

679
00:49:56,328 --> 00:49:59,915
It really contributed to him
reexamining his life.

680
00:49:59,998 --> 00:50:03,084
He'd been given a second chance, and so
what do you do with a second chance?

681
00:50:10,342 --> 00:50:13,803
[Krakauer] So, Jimmy survived this thing
that people don't survive...

682
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:17,224
and he was really messed up.

683
00:50:17,307 --> 00:50:19,267
He was in a bad way psychologically.

684
00:50:19,351 --> 00:50:23,396
And this makes you doubt
your judgment about everything.

685
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,482
He bailed from various commitments.

686
00:50:25,565 --> 00:50:28,360
He's not goin' anywhere.
He's certainly not goin' to Meru.

687
00:50:28,443 --> 00:50:32,072
Renan can't go to Meru.
He's crippled, maybe for life. Seriously.

688
00:50:32,155 --> 00:50:34,783
You know, no one knew
if Renan was gonna come out of this.

689
00:50:39,162 --> 00:50:40,664
[Exhales]

690
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:45,210
[Conrad] Renan and I got together.
He had his neck brace on...

691
00:50:45,293 --> 00:50:47,712
and he was in his La-Z-Boy chair.

692
00:50:47,796 --> 00:50:49,548
And he was kind of like this.

693
00:50:51,758 --> 00:50:54,386
[Typing]

694
00:50:56,972 --> 00:50:59,224
I'm offering encouragement.
I'm like, "Yes, we can do this.

695
00:50:59,307 --> 00:51:01,101
This is- This is good."

696
00:51:01,184 --> 00:51:05,105
Yet, in the back of my mind,
I knew that I might have to be-

697
00:51:05,188 --> 00:51:09,985
it might be, "Renan, you're just physically
are not prepared to go back to Meru."

698
00:51:13,738 --> 00:51:18,660
[Jenni] I think Conrad was
the driving force for the entire trip.

699
00:51:18,743 --> 00:51:23,915
At first I didn't want him to go back,
but it was just that loyalty to Mugs...

700
00:51:23,999 --> 00:51:27,460
and wanting to fulfill that shared dream.

701
00:51:30,797 --> 00:51:36,136
Having climbed mountains myself,
I understood that.

702
00:51:36,219 --> 00:51:40,473
Especially if it's a first ascent.
No one's been there before you.

703
00:51:43,476 --> 00:51:48,773
[Jimmy] After some time off and-
and some serious contemplation...

704
00:51:48,857 --> 00:51:54,446
the idea of not skiing and not climbing
and not being in the mountains...

705
00:51:54,529 --> 00:51:59,618
um, was- was too much to- to imagine.

706
00:52:01,453 --> 00:52:03,955
I just wasn't ready to give it all up.

707
00:52:05,624 --> 00:52:06,958
[Panting]

708
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:12,380
[Renan] There was only five months
until we were supposed to leave for Meru.

709
00:52:12,464 --> 00:52:15,383
It was a pretty serious
point in time where...

710
00:52:15,467 --> 00:52:17,177
I didn't care that I was injured.

711
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:20,805
I just cared that I wasn't going to be
able to join the team again.

712
00:52:20,889 --> 00:52:22,849
Can I have you bring your arms up like so?

713
00:52:22,932 --> 00:52:25,685
[Renan Continuing] And I'm sure, to
my friends and family, that was really hard...

714
00:52:25,769 --> 00:52:28,563
because they just wanted to see me okay.

715
00:52:28,647 --> 00:52:31,858
I just feel bad to put them through that.

716
00:52:35,278 --> 00:52:37,518
[Doctor] One of the fractures
is this thing back here...

717
00:52:37,572 --> 00:52:41,534
which is so far displaced
that that's not gonna really heal.

718
00:52:41,618 --> 00:52:43,286
This is the second fracture.

719
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:46,915
[Renan] One of the biggest question
marks was the vertebral artery.

720
00:52:46,998 --> 00:52:49,584
I'd lost half the blood supply
to my brain...

721
00:52:49,668 --> 00:52:53,088
and climbing at altitude,
there's a high risk of...

722
00:52:53,171 --> 00:52:56,299
some sort of blood clot
getting through that artery...

723
00:52:56,383 --> 00:52:58,843
and giving me a stroke during the climb.

724
00:52:58,927 --> 00:53:01,763
But for me, it was worth the risk.

725
00:53:01,846 --> 00:53:03,848
It was something that I had to do.

726
00:53:03,932 --> 00:53:06,893
It was worth possibly dying for.

727
00:53:09,562 --> 00:53:11,773
I mean, in my mind, I thought it was-

728
00:53:11,856 --> 00:53:14,275
I thought it was crazy
that he wanted to go back.

729
00:53:14,359 --> 00:53:19,197
But I realize that Meru for him
was something to hold onto.

730
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,783
For him, it was like, "This is my dream."

731
00:53:21,866 --> 00:53:24,786
To come back and climb Meru...

732
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:30,208
and prove to himself that he had
the capacity to make a comeback.

733
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:32,377
And I- I understood it as well...

734
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:37,966
because, in a way,
I needed the same thing, you know.

735
00:53:42,137 --> 00:53:46,474
[Grunting]

736
00:53:46,558 --> 00:53:49,894
- The bike.
- [Exhales Sharply]

737
00:53:55,859 --> 00:53:59,904
[Jimmy] Renan had put his heart
and mind into recovering.

738
00:53:59,988 --> 00:54:04,242
And the way that he had progressed was...

739
00:54:04,325 --> 00:54:07,454
almost inhuman.

740
00:54:07,537 --> 00:54:10,331
[Panting]

741
00:54:14,502 --> 00:54:17,005
Conrad and I were gonna go back to Meru.

742
00:54:17,088 --> 00:54:20,175
But we still had to make
a decision about Renan.

743
00:54:20,258 --> 00:54:24,345
And Renan was...
pretty adamant about going.

744
00:54:25,597 --> 00:54:29,642
It was this moment when
the three of us got together...

745
00:54:29,726 --> 00:54:31,978
and Jimmy made the case
for Renan to come along.

746
00:54:33,229 --> 00:54:35,982
[Jenni]
I was against Renan going on the climb.

747
00:54:36,065 --> 00:54:38,401
I just confronted Jimmy
and I said, "You know...

748
00:54:38,485 --> 00:54:41,446
I am not keen about this.

749
00:54:41,529 --> 00:54:43,865
You know, you can't take Renan up there.

750
00:54:43,948 --> 00:54:46,451
I mean, what if he dies?"

751
00:54:49,037 --> 00:54:54,209
But I couldn't talk Jimmy into
throwing Renan off the trip. [Laughs]

752
00:54:54,292 --> 00:54:57,879
It's like he was totally dug in.

753
00:54:57,962 --> 00:55:02,217
He just said, flat out, "If Renan feels
he's ready, I trust Renan."

754
00:55:04,135 --> 00:55:06,221
[Jenni]
I was worried about Renan.

755
00:55:06,304 --> 00:55:07,388
[Groaning]

756
00:55:07,472 --> 00:55:10,475
[Jenni Continuing] But I was also worried
about the well-being of the entire team...

757
00:55:10,558 --> 00:55:15,897
because... just to go up onto a face
like that with a weak partner...

758
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:19,150
where, what if they got
into another big, bad storm?

759
00:55:19,234 --> 00:55:21,554
- [Cracks]
- [Jenni Continuing] Or what if one of 'em...

760
00:55:21,611 --> 00:55:23,696
got wacked in the head with a rock...

761
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:25,824
and they had to get him
down off, and they-

762
00:55:25,907 --> 00:55:28,827
You need to have your partners
be sound and strong.

763
00:55:28,910 --> 00:55:32,997
You know, when our friends heard about it,
they were like-

764
00:55:33,081 --> 00:55:35,834
They thought we were
completely out of our minds.

765
00:55:35,917 --> 00:55:38,211
Whew. Dude, I don't know.

766
00:55:38,294 --> 00:55:41,381
No! No! You know, that's not right.

767
00:55:41,464 --> 00:55:43,341
This isn't like Conrad, or Jimmy.

768
00:55:43,424 --> 00:55:46,678
You know, these guys, they don't fuck
around, they don't do stupid stuff.

769
00:55:46,761 --> 00:55:48,888
If they did, they'd be dead by now.

770
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:57,939
Two or three times,
I had these deep anxiety attacks.

771
00:55:58,022 --> 00:56:01,860
I mean, here it was, at 2:00 in the morning,
and all of a sudden it was just like...

772
00:56:01,943 --> 00:56:07,407
this wave of anxiety came over me,
and I'm- I'm up there, like, going, "Shit."

773
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:11,286
I've got two kids sleeping upstairs.
My wife's there.

774
00:56:11,369 --> 00:56:15,373
Another boy's off at college.
I'm responsible for them.

775
00:56:15,456 --> 00:56:17,959
And I'm going, "You're going back?"

776
00:56:20,128 --> 00:56:21,963
You know, the rewards
of climbing are huge.

777
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:25,675
If you- if you survive it,
if your family comes out of it okay...

778
00:56:25,758 --> 00:56:29,637
if everyone comes out,
then climbing- climbing is so worth it.

779
00:56:29,721 --> 00:56:33,182
The problem is, as we know,
you don't always come out of it okay.

780
00:56:33,266 --> 00:56:37,145
People die. And then you can't justify it.
That is the great dilemma.

781
00:56:39,647 --> 00:56:41,733
Conrad knows this better than anyone.

782
00:56:41,816 --> 00:56:46,154
Look at what happened to Mugs,
and Conrad's next partner, Alex.

783
00:56:46,237 --> 00:56:48,573
[Conrad]
After the death of Mugs in '92...

784
00:56:48,656 --> 00:56:51,701
Alex Lowe became my main climbing partner.

785
00:56:51,784 --> 00:56:55,121
Alex was the premier climber at that time.

786
00:56:56,247 --> 00:57:00,752
Conrad was Alex's favorite partner...

787
00:57:00,835 --> 00:57:02,962
and best friend.

788
00:57:03,046 --> 00:57:06,382
Conrad was just right for him...

789
00:57:06,466 --> 00:57:09,260
because he could match Alex's pace.

790
00:57:09,344 --> 00:57:12,472
And there wasn't too many people
who could do that.

791
00:57:12,555 --> 00:57:15,475
This is Nirvana, what this is.

792
00:57:15,558 --> 00:57:19,979
So we're gonna hang out,
just enjoy the mountains.

793
00:57:20,063 --> 00:57:21,606
[Krakauer]
You know, Mugs was the mentor...

794
00:57:21,689 --> 00:57:24,943
but Alex was much more
Conrad's equal.

795
00:57:25,026 --> 00:57:28,780
These are, you know,
two of the most brilliant climbers ever.

796
00:57:28,863 --> 00:57:30,865
I mean, people were blown away by 'em.

797
00:57:30,949 --> 00:57:32,951
And they fed off each other!

798
00:57:34,202 --> 00:57:36,663
They were this perfect match,
the perfect partnership.

799
00:57:36,746 --> 00:57:40,541
I went to Antarctica with
both Alex and Conrad in '97...

800
00:57:40,625 --> 00:57:43,544
in one of the best trips I've ever done,
and they were in rare form.

801
00:57:43,628 --> 00:57:45,338
Just brilliant to behold.

802
00:57:45,421 --> 00:57:48,466
So he had this new partner,
and they were gonna tear up the world.

803
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:56,140
[Conrad] Alex did a remarkable job
of balancing family.

804
00:57:56,224 --> 00:57:58,810
We were all sort of vagabonds.

805
00:57:58,893 --> 00:58:02,730
And here's Alex. He's, like, legit.
He's married, and he's got kids.

806
00:58:07,402 --> 00:58:10,989
I was married to Alex Lowe for 18 years.

807
00:58:11,072 --> 00:58:16,035
And, um, in the autumn of 1999...

808
00:58:16,119 --> 00:58:19,497
uh, he was on an expedition with Conrad.

809
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:22,709
It was to Shishapangma, in Tibet.

810
00:58:22,792 --> 00:58:26,295
And, uh, they went up
to take a look at the mountain.

811
00:58:28,381 --> 00:58:30,675
[Conrad]
It was supposed to be a rest day.

812
00:58:30,758 --> 00:58:35,346
David Bridges, Alex and I
went up, getting ready to do the climb...

813
00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:41,102
and we got to this point-
it was probably 7:30, 8:00 in the morning.

814
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:45,148
All of a sudden, there was, like, this crack,
and we looked up and it was, "Oh, shit."

815
00:58:45,231 --> 00:58:47,025
There was a- a release.

816
00:58:47,108 --> 00:58:49,110
[Rumbling]

817
00:58:49,193 --> 00:58:53,072
[Jenni] Before Alex left,
I had this weird premonition.

818
00:58:53,156 --> 00:58:55,450
I didn't want him to go on the climb.

819
00:58:55,533 --> 00:58:57,452
I said, you know...

820
00:58:57,535 --> 00:59:00,788
"I'm worried that
you're gonna die in an avalanche."

821
00:59:00,872 --> 00:59:05,251
And Alex said, "I always come home."

822
00:59:05,334 --> 00:59:07,462
[Rumbling]

823
00:59:07,545 --> 00:59:12,216
[Conrad] Alex and David ran straight
downhill. I traversed at an angle.

824
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:15,803
I was like, "I'm gonna lay down
before the avalanche hits."

825
00:59:15,887 --> 00:59:21,017
And as I looked over, David and Alex were
still upright, and they were still running.

826
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:24,395
I was picked up and thrown,
battered, tumbled.

827
00:59:24,479 --> 00:59:27,565
And just kind of half-buried.

828
00:59:27,648 --> 00:59:31,277
And then... it was silent.

829
00:59:34,906 --> 00:59:36,908
I remember standing up
and walking around...

830
00:59:36,991 --> 00:59:41,746
and going over to where I had seen them,
and there was nothing there.

831
00:59:41,829 --> 00:59:47,251
There was no ski stick or a glove sticking
out of the snow or anything like that.

832
00:59:47,335 --> 00:59:49,837
Our other teammates came up
to help with the search...

833
00:59:49,921 --> 00:59:54,675
and we searched there
for the better part of the day.

834
00:59:54,759 --> 00:59:58,096
I went back down to camp.
I needed some medical attention.

835
01:00:01,057 --> 01:00:04,477
[Jenni] I got the phone call.
I thought it was Alex at first.

836
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:08,272
And Andrew's voice came on,
and I instantly panicked.

837
01:00:08,356 --> 01:00:11,734
Andrew's like, "Jenni,
there's been an avalanche."

838
01:00:11,818 --> 01:00:14,529
You know, and then my heart was racing.

839
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:19,283
Right away, I said, "Is Conrad there?"

840
01:00:19,367 --> 01:00:21,994
Because, you know, I thought that...

841
01:00:22,078 --> 01:00:25,581
somehow Conrad would've protected Alex.

842
01:00:25,665 --> 01:00:29,210
You know, that it couldn't happen to him
if Conrad was there with him.

843
01:00:31,295 --> 01:00:34,340
I remember Jenni saying,
"Is there anything else you can do?

844
01:00:34,423 --> 01:00:39,637
Can you go back and look for him?"
And we're like, "No. It's just- He's gone."

845
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:43,432
And it was- it was-

846
01:00:43,516 --> 01:00:46,394
There was, um-
There was just this finality of it.

847
01:00:49,605 --> 01:00:53,818
[Krakauer] After Alex died,
Conrad went through this transformation.

848
01:00:53,901 --> 01:00:55,653
He was just- He looked gaunt.

849
01:00:55,736 --> 01:01:01,075
He was- He had retreated somewhere deep
inside and wasn't comin' out.

850
01:01:01,159 --> 01:01:04,412
I worried he was over the edge
and wasn't coming back.

851
01:01:07,081 --> 01:01:09,375
[Conrad] It's just- I mean,
the wheels were coming off.

852
01:01:09,458 --> 01:01:14,005
And, um, I didn't know
why I was so fucked up.

853
01:01:14,088 --> 01:01:18,217
Gil Roberts, a friend of mine,
who was in a very similar situation.

854
01:01:18,301 --> 01:01:20,678
He was there when
his climbing partner died.

855
01:01:20,761 --> 01:01:24,348
And more than once, he picked up
the phone, and he's like, "Hey, man.

856
01:01:24,432 --> 01:01:26,517
I've gotta come talk to you.
We've gotta get together."

857
01:01:26,601 --> 01:01:29,562
And I didn't know why
Gil wanted to get ahold of me.

858
01:01:29,645 --> 01:01:32,440
And it was, like-

859
01:01:32,523 --> 01:01:36,819
I remember his line.
He's like, "Yep. Survivor's guilt is a bear."

860
01:01:36,903 --> 01:01:39,363
And having to do that. And it was, like-

861
01:01:39,447 --> 01:01:42,366
Because for me, it's, like,
this heavy fucking thing...

862
01:01:42,450 --> 01:01:44,785
that wouldn't leave me alone.

863
01:01:44,869 --> 01:01:47,038
'Cause Alex had it going on.

864
01:01:47,121 --> 01:01:50,625
Here he was, he was successful.
He had three kids, a happy married life.

865
01:01:50,708 --> 01:01:54,629
Everything was cool, and I lived in a van.

866
01:01:56,839 --> 01:02:01,886
[Jenni] Conrad was filled with remorse
over Alex's death...

867
01:02:01,969 --> 01:02:06,349
and he came back from the expedition...

868
01:02:06,432 --> 01:02:10,311
feeling like he was the one
who should've died.

869
01:02:12,438 --> 01:02:14,440
[Conrad]
Trying to find balance and peace in that...

870
01:02:14,523 --> 01:02:16,150
I just didn't know where to go.

871
01:02:16,234 --> 01:02:18,402
But it always circled back
to being with Jenni...

872
01:02:18,486 --> 01:02:21,447
and the conversations
that we had on the telephone...

873
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:23,950
and being together with each other.

874
01:02:30,706 --> 01:02:32,416
[Jenni]
I think he felt like...

875
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:36,337
to continue being a great friend,
he needed to be there for us.

876
01:02:38,172 --> 01:02:42,176
It was like a little connection to Alex
that was still there for me.

877
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:46,764
And then, you know, before we- either of
us knew what was happening...

878
01:02:46,847 --> 01:02:48,766
we were kind of falling in love.

879
01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:53,437
[Conrad] The duress of this tragedy-
Jenni and I, we fell in love.

880
01:02:53,521 --> 01:02:59,026
And then eventually we married,
and I have adopted the boys.

881
01:02:59,110 --> 01:03:01,946
[Typing]

882
01:03:04,824 --> 01:03:08,286
[Jenni]
I wasn't like I chose and said, "Okay.

883
01:03:08,369 --> 01:03:11,539
I'm gonna fall in love with another climber."
It just kind of happened.

884
01:03:13,541 --> 01:03:18,546
I still think I might have been
better off with a cowboy.

885
01:03:20,381 --> 01:03:22,758
[Krakauer] Conrad has this side to him
that realizes...

886
01:03:22,842 --> 01:03:25,678
"I got some heavy responsibilities here."

887
01:03:25,761 --> 01:03:30,224
it's the key to Conrad.
There's this constant dialectic.

888
01:03:30,308 --> 01:03:34,478
He needs the mountains to climb, but
it's like, "Am I taking too many chances?

889
01:03:34,562 --> 01:03:37,732
Can I control the risk?"
Of course you can't control the risk.

890
01:03:37,815 --> 01:03:41,527
"Well, why am I doing this? Because
I have to do it or I go fucking crazy."

891
01:03:54,665 --> 01:03:58,336
[Renan] In the end, Jimmy and Conrad
left the decision up to me.

892
01:03:58,419 --> 01:03:59,420
[Shutter Clicks]

893
01:03:59,503 --> 01:04:02,673
Even though it'd only been
five months since the accident...

894
01:04:02,757 --> 01:04:06,010
I decided I wanted to give it a go.

895
01:04:06,093 --> 01:04:10,639
[Conrad] We had become so close
after the 2008 ordeal...

896
01:04:10,723 --> 01:04:14,518
that to not give him the opportunity-

897
01:04:14,602 --> 01:04:17,438
it wasn't celebrating the teamwork that
we came into the climb with.

898
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:19,732
- That was the decision.
- [Exhales]

899
01:04:24,695 --> 01:04:28,532
[Amee] Well, I wasn't really given
a choice... in the matter.

900
01:04:28,616 --> 01:04:30,993
Renan actually decided to go to Meru...

901
01:04:31,077 --> 01:04:33,454
and bought a plane ticket
and didn't even tell me.

902
01:04:34,455 --> 01:04:37,375
It was kind of a slap in the face, but...

903
01:04:37,458 --> 01:04:41,253
the bigger concern was his safety.

904
01:04:43,005 --> 01:04:45,216
[Jimmy]
He knew the heat that we were taking...

905
01:04:45,299 --> 01:04:49,637
and he knew that
we had to trust him to let him go.

906
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:51,931
And that's what we did. We trusted him.

907
01:04:54,850 --> 01:04:57,353
[Krakauer] Maybe that's way
over the heads of most people...

908
01:04:57,436 --> 01:05:01,774
that kind of risk
and that kind of expression of trust.

909
01:05:01,857 --> 01:05:07,071
But when Conrad was a young buck,
and Mugs was teaching him...

910
01:05:07,154 --> 01:05:10,324
they'd be at a really sketchy pitch-
dangerous, you can't afford to fall.

911
01:05:10,408 --> 01:05:14,620
Mugs would be like, "Okay, Conrad,
we all know that I can lead this.

912
01:05:14,703 --> 01:05:18,582
Now let's see if you can lead it.
Are you ready?"

913
01:05:18,666 --> 01:05:21,752
So many decades later, it was Conrad...

914
01:05:21,836 --> 01:05:26,757
saying to Jimmy, Renan, "Okay,
you guys had a rough spring.

915
01:05:26,841 --> 01:05:29,677
But you can do this.
I trust you, and we're gonna do this."

916
01:05:42,273 --> 01:05:44,275
[Chattering]

917
01:05:51,365 --> 01:05:55,453
[Chanting]

918
01:06:05,629 --> 01:06:09,467
[Jimmy]
The entire hike in was intense.

919
01:06:12,052 --> 01:06:15,973
There's no doubt that I had
a heavy heart going into it.

920
01:06:16,056 --> 01:06:20,144
It felt just like so much...

921
01:06:20,227 --> 01:06:21,812
pressure.

922
01:06:21,896 --> 01:06:26,358
You know, it felt a little bit like we
were heading to the gallows. You know?

923
01:06:47,922 --> 01:06:50,049
[Renan]
Fifteen feet, Conrad!

924
01:06:53,844 --> 01:06:57,723
[Equipment Clinking]

925
01:06:59,266 --> 01:07:01,936
[Shouting, indistinct]

926
01:07:23,582 --> 01:07:27,878
[Conrad]
The old geek ripped.

927
01:07:27,962 --> 01:07:30,214
- Is that what sent ya?
- Yeah.

928
01:07:32,049 --> 01:07:36,178
I just heard the "ping"
and then the fucking gear rattling.

929
01:07:36,262 --> 01:07:38,931
Cha-ching, cha-ching.

930
01:07:39,014 --> 01:07:41,725
Oh, it was a good-
Of all the places to fall though-

931
01:07:41,809 --> 01:07:42,809
Ah, it's dreamy.

932
01:07:42,851 --> 01:07:45,312
[Jimmy]
That was a good place to fall.

933
01:07:45,396 --> 01:07:48,732
It must have been, like,
five pounds on you, huh, Renan, like-

934
01:07:48,816 --> 01:07:53,279
[Renan] Yeah. Well, I got lifted
off the triangle ledge.

935
01:07:54,697 --> 01:07:57,199
[Fabric Flapping]

936
01:07:59,368 --> 01:08:01,370
[Wind Howling]

- [Rustling]
- [Grunting]

938
01:08:06,333 --> 01:08:11,088
Oh! Fuck!

939
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:14,800
[Jimmy]
Oh, man.

940
01:08:15,801 --> 01:08:17,678
[Renan]
Survival mode.

941
01:08:21,348 --> 01:08:23,350
It's broke.

942
01:08:25,352 --> 01:08:29,440
We're Himalayan big-wall climbing,
and we broke our portaledge.

943
01:08:38,449 --> 01:08:40,534
- That's more straight.
- Yeah.

944
01:08:49,418 --> 01:08:52,129
- [Jimmy] Whew.
- [Conrad] Athletic tape...

945
01:08:52,212 --> 01:08:55,633
two eye screws, and-
and we're back in business.

946
01:08:56,216 --> 01:08:57,718

This route's pretty steep.

958

That's why all the shit's
hanging off in space. [Chuckling]

[Muttering]

960
01:10:01,782 --> 01:10:05,661
[Chuckles] I just had to film
what we're eating right now.

961
01:10:06,787 --> 01:10:10,541
Conrad wants us to eat
yesterday's leftovers.

962
01:10:10,624 --> 01:10:13,252
Oh, it looks great.

963
01:10:13,335 --> 01:10:15,629
[Conrad] We have one choice
on the menu, and it is couscous.

964
01:10:15,713 --> 01:10:17,256
[Jimmy] Tomorrow,
what are we having for dinner?

965
01:10:17,339 --> 01:10:18,340
Couscous.

966
01:10:18,424 --> 01:10:20,134
- [Jimmy, Laughing] And the next day?
- Couscous.

967
01:10:20,217 --> 01:10:21,927
[Jimmy] What did we have for dinner
four days ago?

968
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:24,138
- Couscous.
- [Jimmy] Sweet.

969
01:10:24,221 --> 01:10:26,515
[Conrad]
This looks really good, I think.

970
01:10:26,598 --> 01:10:30,686
I'm sure that, uh Happy and Leroy, my two
dogs, would just love this.

971
01:10:30,769 --> 01:10:32,229
They'd be like, "Yeah!"

972
01:10:32,312 --> 01:10:34,148
We're not his dogs.

973
01:10:34,815 --> 01:10:36,316
Mmm.

974
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:39,862
Mmm, couscous.

Whew.

977
01:11:15,189 --> 01:11:19,610
[Jimmy] I was watching Renan,
and he seemed confused and slow.

978
01:11:19,693 --> 01:11:21,779
I thought it might have been the altitude.

979
01:11:35,334 --> 01:11:37,044
I'm not sure what's going on.

981
01:11:39,671 --> 01:11:43,008
[Renan's Voice]
Something was really wrong.

982
01:11:46,553 --> 01:11:51,683
I literally just turned
my face away and cried.

983
01:11:54,269 --> 01:11:57,314
[Jimmy] When we finally
