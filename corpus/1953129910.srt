1
00:01:10,338 --> 00:01:12,411
Soon. Soon.

2
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,026
Your child has her nose
pressed against your heart.

3
00:01:20,465 --> 00:01:23,096
Put one more in here for shearing.

4
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,742
it appears she's not too anxious...

5
00:01:45,942 --> 00:01:47,138
...to face life.

6
00:01:48,732 --> 00:01:50,208
Who could blame her?

7
00:01:50,407 --> 00:01:54,075
This world being what it is.

8
00:02:18,356 --> 00:02:21,944
Wives, look after everything for a while.

9
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:25,413
I'm just going to see
how things are with Lot.

10
00:02:26,768 --> 00:02:29,160
Serug! Serug!

11
00:02:34,543 --> 00:02:36,138
Hold her head.

12
00:02:39,048 --> 00:02:41,161
Gentle, gentle, gentle.

13
00:02:43,952 --> 00:02:46,464
You're very close. You're very close.

14
00:02:46,623 --> 00:02:48,657
Aisha, hurry! Quickly!

15
00:02:48,816 --> 00:02:50,331
Quickly.

16
00:02:56,073 --> 00:02:57,907
Try again. Try again.

17
00:02:58,066 --> 00:03:00,060
Push, push!

18
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:01,774
Push!

19
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,383
Come inside, Lot.
She's a strong girl.

20
00:03:11,542 --> 00:03:13,416
Come on! In.

21
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,443
She's fine. Fine.

22
00:03:17,602 --> 00:03:19,197
Inside.

23
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:25,616
You have a god for every need, Nahor.

24
00:03:26,015 --> 00:03:27,331
Even for my needs?

25
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:32,115
lf you are prepared to become
an accomplice to this god.

26
00:03:32,274 --> 00:03:34,906
-Which one is this?
-Sin...

27
00:03:35,065 --> 00:03:36,620
...god of fertility.

28
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,331
Does it have...?

29
00:03:43,558 --> 00:03:45,830
Excellent, excellent.

30
00:03:48,182 --> 00:03:51,651
-How much?
-You see this beardless orphan?

31
00:03:51,811 --> 00:03:53,007
He's my nephew.

32
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,957
And that was his wife,
trying to drop their first child.

33
00:03:56,117 --> 00:03:57,392
How much?

34
00:03:57,552 --> 00:03:59,426
I'll give you a good price.

35
00:03:59,585 --> 00:04:03,413
Reko, my friend, look at this
bird-breasted boy and ask yourself:

36
00:04:03,572 --> 00:04:07,240
''How could a child like this
father a child himself? How?''

37
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,868
Because he sacrificed to Sin,
god of moon.

38
00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:13,221
Four silver pieces.

39
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:15,214
One.

40
00:04:15,852 --> 00:04:18,204
Don't give up now, child. Don't give up.

41
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,912
Clear your mind. Clear your mind.

42
00:04:22,869 --> 00:04:24,025
Clear your mind.

43
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:31,920
lf you think that's loud, wait till the
sound you'll make if she drops a daughter.

44
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,554
Clear your mind.

45
00:04:34,671 --> 00:04:35,907
All right, look...

46
00:04:36,106 --> 00:04:38,937
...I’ll do it for you. I’ll do it for you.

47
00:04:39,096 --> 00:04:41,688
Here, here. I’ll do it for you.

48
00:05:19,484 --> 00:05:21,518
Run, get my brother. Now!

49
00:05:29,013 --> 00:05:30,568
Father....

50
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,402
Don't leave me.

51
00:05:32,562 --> 00:05:33,758
Don't leave me.

52
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,392
Not now.

53
00:05:35,552 --> 00:05:38,263
Not yet. Not yet.

54
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:52,816
This market is ended until further notice.
Clear the square!

55
00:05:53,254 --> 00:05:54,610
Clear the square!

56
00:05:54,769 --> 00:05:56,763
My esteemed first councilor.

57
00:05:56,962 --> 00:05:59,952
You are Nahor, born son of Terah,
are you not?

58
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:01,348
You know l am.

59
00:06:01,507 --> 00:06:03,939
But tell me, why have you ended
the market?

60
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:06,650
This concerns the royal covenant...

61
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:10,398
...to rent the king's lands to Terah
and his people.

62
00:06:10,558 --> 00:06:16,458
l, therefore, bring a summons from the king
for your father to appear before him.

63
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:24,831
Our covenant expires at sunset.

64
00:06:25,668 --> 00:06:26,984
Renew it...

65
00:06:27,143 --> 00:06:31,370
...or you and your people will be expelled
from this city and all its lands.

66
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:34,081
Your Rightful Honor,
first councilor to the king...

67
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,430
...should we discuss delicate matters
under the blistering sun?

68
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:39,942
-Cooler place perhaps?
-Have this dung cleared.

69
00:06:40,141 --> 00:06:41,895
The king walks here today.

70
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:45,165
-Sir....
-Spit it out. What?

71
00:06:45,324 --> 00:06:46,839
Your father....

72
00:06:47,956 --> 00:06:49,351
Your father.

73
00:06:50,467 --> 00:06:56,089
Oh, Father, l thank all the gods
for taking away your pain so quickly.

74
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,192
To be robbed again by that...

75
00:07:01,392 --> 00:07:03,664
...thief and his king.

76
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:07,213
Brother, for 23 years,
you have outwitted that fool.

77
00:07:07,412 --> 00:07:10,562
Today, no doubt, you will do so again.

78
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,914
You ever tried to feed a vulture?

79
00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:17,100
You better count your fingers afterwards.

80
00:07:18,695 --> 00:07:21,685
It's good to hear you laugh.
it means you're getting better.

81
00:07:21,845 --> 00:07:23,280
Yeah. It’s late.

82
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,875
We have business.

83
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:28,423
-Father....
-Please, please stay.

84
00:07:28,623 --> 00:07:31,493
You stay. Let me talk to the king.

85
00:07:31,693 --> 00:07:34,085
He makes the covenant with me, not you.

86
00:07:34,244 --> 00:07:35,480
Not yet.

87
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,075
And you say nothing.

88
00:07:37,275 --> 00:07:38,790
Let Nahor talk.

89
00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:43,654
Your brother knows these people.
His wits have made us richer every year.

90
00:07:43,813 --> 00:07:49,235
Nahor knows how to use his tongue.
And you keep yours in your mouth.

91
00:07:49,515 --> 00:07:52,943
This day marks the end of the covenant...

92
00:07:53,103 --> 00:07:54,737
...between Asdi Takin...

93
00:07:54,977 --> 00:07:59,881
...King of Haran,
and Terah and his people.

94
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,635
So be it.

95
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,343
These shadows grow long.

96
00:08:05,662 --> 00:08:07,895
A new covenant must be made...

97
00:08:08,253 --> 00:08:10,566
...before the last light.

98
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:13,277
l, Nahor, will speak for my father.

99
00:08:13,436 --> 00:08:16,945
The generosity of the King of Haran
is known throughout the world.

100
00:08:17,104 --> 00:08:19,935
We've prospered for many years
under his benevolent hand.

101
00:08:20,095 --> 00:08:21,969
He has our endless gratitude.

102
00:08:22,128 --> 00:08:25,238
Thanks will not feed our people.

103
00:08:25,397 --> 00:08:26,514
What do you offer?

104
00:08:26,713 --> 00:08:30,421
In the new year, we will lay at the feet
of His Majesty the same number...

105
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:33,930
...of mature sheep and cattle
as the old year, the same quantity...

106
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:37,677
...of spun wool, tanned skins,
silver pieces--

107
00:08:37,837 --> 00:08:38,834
The same?

108
00:08:38,993 --> 00:08:40,428
Plus!

109
00:08:41,744 --> 00:08:42,940
Plus...

110
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,372
...a bonus of one-fourth of all that.

111
00:08:46,528 --> 00:08:50,635
We appreciate your sincere remarks...

112
00:08:50,794 --> 00:08:52,668
...and your offer.

113
00:08:54,821 --> 00:08:56,297
But, old man...

114
00:08:56,735 --> 00:08:59,167
...the bonus will not be one-fourth.

115
00:08:59,965 --> 00:09:03,314
To graze on my lands for another year...

116
00:09:03,712 --> 00:09:05,068
...you will pay double.

117
00:09:07,938 --> 00:09:09,693
Double, Your Majesty?

118
00:09:09,852 --> 00:09:11,008
Double?

119
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,042
This is...

120
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:15,753
...an unprecedented demand. It's....

121
00:09:15,912 --> 00:09:17,986
It’s out of the question. We cannot.

122
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,820
Then l am sad to say...

123
00:09:19,979 --> 00:09:24,166
...your tribe must leave my paradise.

124
00:09:25,043 --> 00:09:26,518
Your Majesty...

125
00:09:26,677 --> 00:09:30,465
...why do you abuse us in this manner?

126
00:09:35,688 --> 00:09:38,917
In past years, you've refused us water.

127
00:09:39,077 --> 00:09:43,542
We dug for it. You seized our wells
and made us pay silver for the water.

128
00:09:44,698 --> 00:09:50,240
You gave us your worst lands. After our
herds made the earth fertile with dung...

129
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:55,224
...you drove us off so your farmers
could grow barley fivefold.

130
00:09:56,101 --> 00:10:00,886
You ordered us to fight your enemies.
We gave you victories with our blood.

131
00:10:01,444 --> 00:10:02,999
Oh, yes.

132
00:10:04,275 --> 00:10:06,428
Haran is a paradise...

133
00:10:06,587 --> 00:10:09,218
...but our people helped to make it so.

134
00:10:09,378 --> 00:10:10,534
You?

135
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:12,328
You did all this?

136
00:10:14,242 --> 00:10:20,183
The riches of Haran pour from the hands
of the blessed god Sin and nobody else.

137
00:10:20,342 --> 00:10:24,449
Instead, you wandered here from Ur,
a small tribe...

138
00:10:24,608 --> 00:10:30,270
...and now you are as thick as the lice
in my hair. You will pay double...

139
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:34,097
...because you are now twice
the number you were.

140
00:10:35,014 --> 00:10:37,606
Our tribe grows because of the children.

141
00:10:37,765 --> 00:10:39,360
Our children.

142
00:10:40,516 --> 00:10:41,872
Must we pay twice...

143
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,144
...because our women are fertile?

144
00:10:44,304 --> 00:10:45,779
Not all your women.

145
00:10:46,138 --> 00:10:48,690
Your wife, for instance...

146
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:51,480
...is a woman of great beauty, l hear.

147
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,673
A problem that perhaps lies elsewhere.

148
00:10:53,873 --> 00:10:58,816
We will be glad to pay whatever
His Highness, in his wisdom, asks.

149
00:10:58,976 --> 00:11:00,690
Double?

150
00:11:01,129 --> 00:11:02,883
It will be double.

151
00:11:05,714 --> 00:11:08,545
Let the covenant be made.

152
00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:15,602
lf l break this covenant...

153
00:11:15,761 --> 00:11:19,868
...may what is done to these beasts
be done to me.

154
00:11:26,646 --> 00:11:30,952
There, you've done it. It’s over.

155
00:11:37,371 --> 00:11:41,557
There, there. It’s over.
You've done it, you've done it.

156
00:11:41,756 --> 00:11:44,747
-Oh, she's so lovely.
-All right, all right.

157
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:48,454
-This will help. Let her drink this.
-Look at me. Look at me.

158
00:11:48,614 --> 00:11:50,328
Mint tea. It'll do her good.

159
00:11:51,803 --> 00:11:54,714
Spoiled, ungrateful child!

160
00:12:09,785 --> 00:12:11,499
Take your baby.

161
00:12:11,659 --> 00:12:13,612
She's beautiful.

162
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,686
And hungry. She wants you.

163
00:12:15,845 --> 00:12:18,636
She's a girl. Give her to the servants!

164
00:12:18,795 --> 00:12:21,028
Leave me alone. l don't want her!

165
00:12:22,105 --> 00:12:23,341
You don't...

166
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,895
...want her.

167
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:48,463
Oh, thank you, Sarai.

168
00:13:50,735 --> 00:13:52,968
May you have many more.

169
00:14:08,796 --> 00:14:13,660
So the King of Haran has lice.

170
00:14:15,136 --> 00:14:19,561
A head of hair to a louse is a head of hair,
even if it wears a crown.

171
00:14:19,721 --> 00:14:20,917
Thank you.

172
00:14:21,076 --> 00:14:22,830
Thank you, son.

173
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:30,166
How are you feeling?

174
00:14:31,442 --> 00:14:33,635
That was nothing yesterday.

175
00:14:33,994 --> 00:14:36,665
Something l ate perhaps.

176
00:14:37,463 --> 00:14:40,014
I'm happy for Lot.

177
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,968
Yes.

178
00:14:42,127 --> 00:14:43,682
A daughter.

179
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:46,872
And time for more, time for a son.

180
00:14:47,749 --> 00:14:51,018
And Sarai, as usual,
was a very good midwife.

181
00:14:51,218 --> 00:14:52,613
She probably....

182
00:14:52,773 --> 00:14:54,168
Father...

183
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:55,843
...it is killing her.

184
00:14:56,361 --> 00:14:58,833
She's brought so many children
into the world...

185
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:01,544
...each birth is like a little death to her.

186
00:15:01,703 --> 00:15:04,853
And when she dies a little, so do you.

187
00:15:05,451 --> 00:15:08,880
l have nothing else. She's all l have.

188
00:15:11,113 --> 00:15:12,389
Abram...

189
00:15:12,548 --> 00:15:14,661
...you're a mystery to me.

190
00:15:14,861 --> 00:15:16,854
Now, Lot, l understand.

191
00:15:17,053 --> 00:15:20,961
He's inherited from your dead brother,
so he's a child...

192
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,868
...with the wealth of a man,
trying very hard to be a man.

193
00:15:25,027 --> 00:15:26,742
Nahor, l understand.

194
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,529
He's rich, but he thinks like a pauper...

195
00:15:30,689 --> 00:15:33,878
...looking under every stone
for his next piece of silver.

196
00:15:34,038 --> 00:15:35,673
But you?

197
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,463
You have more wealth
than either of them...

198
00:15:38,623 --> 00:15:41,095
...and when l die, twice that.

199
00:15:41,254 --> 00:15:42,450
And yet...

200
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,205
...it means nothing to you.

201
00:15:44,364 --> 00:15:46,717
Instead, you brood and ponder...

202
00:15:46,876 --> 00:15:49,388
...question and search.

203
00:15:49,747 --> 00:15:51,421
For what?

204
00:15:51,581 --> 00:15:55,368
Why can't you be happy
for what we have here, now?

205
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:01,070
Abram, the king's right.

206
00:16:01,229 --> 00:16:03,502
I've never seen a place so green.

207
00:16:03,661 --> 00:16:05,894
Their gods, as he said...

208
00:16:06,053 --> 00:16:08,246
...have made Haran a paradise.

209
00:16:09,323 --> 00:16:12,273
l have tried to reach those gods...

210
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,024
...but l get nothing.

211
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:17,536
Nothing?

212
00:16:18,732 --> 00:16:20,287
You get nothing from the gods?

213
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,559
-Nothing at all?
-Nothing.

214
00:16:26,108 --> 00:16:27,344
Listen...

215
00:16:27,503 --> 00:16:31,969
...Lot took his bride to the shrine of Sin
for the ritual of the full moon.

216
00:16:32,128 --> 00:16:33,883
Did you know that?

217
00:16:34,042 --> 00:16:37,232
And no sooner does he
take her to bed than:

218
00:16:37,391 --> 00:16:39,105
A child.

219
00:16:39,903 --> 00:16:43,092
Yes, sometimes the gods listen.

220
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,389
What is it?

221
00:16:55,253 --> 00:16:57,007
Is it the king?

222
00:16:57,605 --> 00:16:59,160
The king? No.

223
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:01,512
No, not the king.

224
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,303
He's no better nor worse...

225
00:17:04,463 --> 00:17:06,974
...than any other king I’ve met.

226
00:17:08,729 --> 00:17:10,204
Is it our life here?

227
00:17:10,762 --> 00:17:12,676
How can one...

228
00:17:12,835 --> 00:17:15,586
...not be content in a place like this?

229
00:17:15,746 --> 00:17:18,656
Water, grass.

230
00:17:20,132 --> 00:17:21,487
This...

231
00:17:21,647 --> 00:17:23,401
...is a rich land.

232
00:17:24,756 --> 00:17:25,913
Is it me?

233
00:17:33,926 --> 00:17:36,837
Oh, no, no.

234
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:43,934
Talk to me.

235
00:17:45,608 --> 00:17:47,682
l don't know.

236
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:50,153
l don't know.

237
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,905
l just need....

238
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,373
-What? What do you need?
-It’s....

239
00:17:59,682 --> 00:18:02,394
-l want to give you a child, but l can't.
-No, no. No.

240
00:18:02,553 --> 00:18:04,905
-It’s not that. Not that at all.
-Then what?

241
00:18:05,902 --> 00:18:08,374
The truth is, l....

242
00:18:08,533 --> 00:18:10,208
l don't know.

243
00:18:10,846 --> 00:18:12,760
l just don't know.

244
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:31,299
Father, without doubt,
Sarai is a good woman, a beauty.

245
00:18:31,459 --> 00:18:33,931
Enough's enough.
She is, after all, only a woman.

246
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,881
-Are you suggesting a second wife?
-What else?

247
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,230
Look at me. After Milcah dropped
three sons, l took Reumah.

248
00:18:40,389 --> 00:18:43,340
A luxury at the time perhaps,
but now l have five sons.

249
00:18:43,499 --> 00:18:45,812
A man can't have too many.
That's why we marry.

250
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:50,397
Of course, my brother can't think
like that, practical, feet on the ground.

251
00:18:50,556 --> 00:18:52,948
He fights his secret war in his heart...

252
00:18:53,108 --> 00:18:56,218
...and clings to Sarai
like a drowning man.

253
00:18:56,377 --> 00:18:58,371
Abram with a second wife?

254
00:18:58,769 --> 00:19:00,444
-l don't know.
-Why not?

255
00:19:00,603 --> 00:19:03,913
Who knows, he might even enjoy it,
if he ever allowed himself.

256
00:19:04,112 --> 00:19:05,587
Oh, he's such a-- Brother!

257
00:19:09,096 --> 00:19:10,491
Those pains.

258
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:13,003
Oh, no, no. They've become my friends.

259
00:19:13,202 --> 00:19:14,518
I'd miss them...

260
00:19:14,678 --> 00:19:18,106
...if they didn't visit me once in a while.

261
00:19:21,336 --> 00:19:22,492
Come inside, Abram.

262
00:19:22,651 --> 00:19:24,645
Something I want to show you.

263
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:31,263
Rather impressive, don't you think?

264
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:37,084
Here's a divinity with a hidden power.

265
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:41,271
Herbs of some kind.

266
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,663
I’m not sure exactly which.

267
00:19:43,822 --> 00:19:47,012
Tastes awful, but it's blessed
by this deity...

268
00:19:47,171 --> 00:19:50,800
...which gives it amazing potency.

269
00:19:51,796 --> 00:19:53,590
Is this why you asked me here?

270
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,106
Well, yes, l thought...

271
00:19:55,265 --> 00:19:56,940
...just to show you.

272
00:19:57,099 --> 00:19:59,372
Abram, tonight, try a little of this.

273
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,727
Sarai too.

274
00:20:00,887 --> 00:20:04,156
Reumah and l tried it,
and l can't tell you--

275
00:20:09,778 --> 00:20:12,569
Gods for this. Gods for that.

276
00:20:13,765 --> 00:20:16,237
A god to eat!

277
00:20:16,396 --> 00:20:17,831
Abram, what are you doing?

278
00:20:17,991 --> 00:20:20,184
-A god to sleep!
-Are you insane?!

279
00:20:20,343 --> 00:20:21,938
-Stop it.
-Gods for riches!

280
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:23,812
-Stop it!
-Gods for rain!

281
00:20:23,971 --> 00:20:25,247
You're a madman!

282
00:20:26,045 --> 00:20:27,201
They're all...

283
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,274
...worthless, false!

284
00:20:29,433 --> 00:20:31,188
Useless!

285
00:20:31,347 --> 00:20:32,384
Stop it!

286
00:20:33,062 --> 00:20:34,497
Absurd!

287
00:20:34,696 --> 00:20:37,687
Lies, lies, lies!

288
00:20:37,846 --> 00:20:38,883
Stop!

289
00:20:41,075 --> 00:20:42,232
No, no, no.

290
00:20:42,391 --> 00:20:45,740
-Evil!
-Stop this madness now!

291
00:22:42,918 --> 00:22:44,672
Abram.

292
00:22:46,586 --> 00:22:48,260
Abram.

293
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,811
Go away...

294
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:32,037
...from your father's house.

295
00:23:32,356 --> 00:23:34,350
Your father's...

296
00:23:35,586 --> 00:23:37,260
...house?

297
00:23:38,456 --> 00:23:40,689
From my father's...

298
00:23:40,848 --> 00:23:42,563
...house?

299
00:23:44,796 --> 00:23:48,105
To the land I will show you.

300
00:23:48,304 --> 00:23:50,338
The land l...

301
00:23:51,573 --> 00:23:53,567
...will show you?

302
00:23:59,946 --> 00:24:01,900
Make...

303
00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:03,495
...of you...

304
00:24:05,448 --> 00:24:07,282
...a great...

305
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:10,033
...nation?

306
00:24:16,093 --> 00:24:19,722
And l will bless...

307
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,111
...all those who bless you?

308
00:24:24,865 --> 00:24:28,692
And curse all those who curse you?

309
00:24:30,606 --> 00:24:32,600
And in...

310
00:24:33,317 --> 00:24:34,753
...you...

311
00:24:36,467 --> 00:24:39,138
...shall all the families...

312
00:24:39,975 --> 00:24:41,969
...of the earth...

313
00:24:42,806 --> 00:24:44,560
...be blessed.

314
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:57,602
Let me see if l understand this.

315
00:24:57,761 --> 00:25:00,313
There you were, facedown in the mud...

316
00:25:00,472 --> 00:25:02,825
...and a god spoke to you.

317
00:25:02,984 --> 00:25:04,260
Fine.

318
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,054
But what god?

319
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:08,327
What powers does he have?

320
00:25:08,486 --> 00:25:11,636
What does he look like?
Where does he live?

321
00:25:12,035 --> 00:25:16,580
Brother, l have studied
every god known to man...

322
00:25:16,739 --> 00:25:19,450
...and they all have names, faces, places.

323
00:25:20,049 --> 00:25:21,883
Besides you, Abram...

324
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,474
...who knows this god?

325
00:25:29,697 --> 00:25:30,933
l don't know, Father.

326
00:25:31,092 --> 00:25:33,046
Perhaps many...

327
00:25:33,644 --> 00:25:34,840
...in their hearts.

328
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,355
Oh, l see!

329
00:25:36,515 --> 00:25:38,867
A god to be worshiped in ignorance.

330
00:25:39,027 --> 00:25:40,940
Not so, brother.

331
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,927
It is simply that l am ignorant.

332
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:47,798
l do not know him yet.

333
00:25:48,117 --> 00:25:49,154
But in time....

334
00:25:49,313 --> 00:25:51,187
Fine. Fine. In time.

335
00:25:51,346 --> 00:25:52,503
But now...

336
00:25:52,662 --> 00:25:58,483
...he's telling you to pack up everything and
everyone and leave for who knows where?

337
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,513
No! It’s insane.

338
00:26:01,673 --> 00:26:04,902
l refuse to follow this brother
of mine and his voices.

339
00:26:05,062 --> 00:26:08,451
We've worked too hard and paid
too high a price for what we have.

340
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:11,082
And he wants to forsake it. For what?

341
00:26:11,241 --> 00:26:13,634
You have changed, Abram. l can see it.

342
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:15,707
No, he hasn't.

343
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:20,292
-He's still as stubborn as an ass.
-Stop pacing and sit down.

344
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:22,604
Tell me, Abram...

345
00:26:22,764 --> 00:26:24,797
...help me understand.

346
00:26:25,794 --> 00:26:27,508
What has happened to you?

347
00:26:27,668 --> 00:26:31,854
This god said Abram's name will be famous,
that he will make of him a great nation.

348
00:26:32,014 --> 00:26:35,682
But how? How can Abram make a nation
of people without...?

349
00:26:35,841 --> 00:26:37,595
Children?

350
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:43,935
-l don't know.
-We've heard enough of this nonsense.

351
00:26:44,772 --> 00:26:49,277
lf Abram and his men leave, we're at risk.
And you, brother, are in greater danger.

352
00:26:49,437 --> 00:26:51,470
Out there? Alone?

353
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:54,341
Your people will be like sheep
among jackals.

354
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,175
l feel...

355
00:26:56,813 --> 00:26:58,726
...that l am protected.

356
00:27:00,401 --> 00:27:02,036
This nameless god...

357
00:27:02,195 --> 00:27:03,630
...again.

358
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,225
Nahor.

359
00:27:05,385 --> 00:27:08,056
Lot, leave us.

360
00:27:09,372 --> 00:27:11,485
Come on. Go! Out!

361
00:27:17,146 --> 00:27:18,781
Abram...

362
00:27:19,219 --> 00:27:20,974
...you're my son.

363
00:27:21,133 --> 00:27:23,645
You owe me obedience.

364
00:27:23,924 --> 00:27:27,672
And instead you listen
to this unknown god...

365
00:27:27,831 --> 00:27:31,459
...a nameless god who whispers
into your ear...

366
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:33,931
...and bids you to leave
your father's house...

367
00:27:34,091 --> 00:27:35,726
...to break your heart and mine.

368
00:27:35,885 --> 00:27:38,237
What--? What kind of god is this?

369
00:27:39,673 --> 00:27:41,547
l don't know, Father.

370
00:27:42,025 --> 00:27:43,381
But l....

371
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,534
l heard his voice.

372
00:27:45,773 --> 00:27:49,162
It spoke to me above the silence
of all the other gods.

373
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,149
You despise the gods
who have given us protection...

374
00:27:53,308 --> 00:27:59,448
...and made us rich and allowed our children
and herds to grow healthy and strong.

375
00:28:00,206 --> 00:28:05,389
You renounce all our gods
because you've found a new god?

376
00:28:31,464 --> 00:28:33,138
l cannot stay, Father...

377
00:28:33,816 --> 00:28:35,451
...as much...

378
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:37,803
...as it grieves me...

379
00:28:37,962 --> 00:28:40,036
...the thought of leaving you.

380
00:28:41,192 --> 00:28:42,667
But....

381
00:28:42,826 --> 00:28:44,461
l felt....

382
00:28:45,338 --> 00:28:46,614
l....

383
00:28:47,093 --> 00:28:48,966
I’ve heard him call to me.

384
00:28:53,711 --> 00:28:55,585
Abram...

385
00:28:56,901 --> 00:29:01,406
...you're taking away
much joy from our lives.

386
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,874
l counted on you...

387
00:29:05,512 --> 00:29:08,742
...my son, for the days to come.

388
00:29:10,137 --> 00:29:13,646
You have a new heart,
and l don't know it.

389
00:29:14,643 --> 00:29:16,676
But you know mine.

390
00:29:17,115 --> 00:29:18,390
Go.

391
00:29:18,949 --> 00:29:20,185
Go in peace.

392
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:25,806
With the blessing of your god,
whoever he is.

393
00:29:26,643 --> 00:29:28,717
And with mine.

394
00:29:44,984 --> 00:29:46,578
Uncle...

395
00:29:47,376 --> 00:29:48,931
...I’m going to come with you.

396
00:29:53,276 --> 00:29:55,031
To protect you.

397
00:30:10,022 --> 00:30:12,294
Let us gather the herds.

398
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:12,789
Don't drink too fast.

399
00:34:14,384 --> 00:34:15,779
Slowly.

400
00:35:21,209 --> 00:35:23,402
Where were you going to?

401
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:26,831
To Haran, in the north.

402
00:35:27,229 --> 00:35:29,024
That's where we came from.

403
00:35:31,057 --> 00:35:32,971
Then you're going south.

404
00:35:34,406 --> 00:35:36,001
Toward Damascus.

405
00:35:37,954 --> 00:35:40,666
That's not a place where one
is necessarily welcomed.

406
00:35:41,144 --> 00:35:44,373
Or, at least, as far as I’m concerned.

407
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:47,045
There's much oppression there.

408
00:35:47,204 --> 00:35:49,317
In fact, l was--

409
00:35:50,234 --> 00:35:51,510
Watch out.

410
00:36:05,704 --> 00:36:07,378
We come in peace.

411
00:36:17,824 --> 00:36:22,050
That man is a slave. He ran away
from his master in Damascus.

412
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:23,924
We are taking him back.

413
00:36:25,041 --> 00:36:29,626
That man is a guest in our camp.
Therefore, his life is sacred to us.

414
00:36:29,785 --> 00:36:32,815
He must come with us.
Back to the man who owns him.

415
00:36:32,975 --> 00:36:34,570
Owns him?

416
00:36:35,686 --> 00:36:39,274
Then l am willing to pay
for this slave's freedom.

417
00:36:39,992 --> 00:36:44,417
The price is high. His master spent
a fortune to buy him as a scribe.

418
00:36:44,617 --> 00:36:47,527
-He's fed him for years.
-l will pay the price.

419
00:37:42,268 --> 00:37:44,103
Thank you, master.

420
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:48,528
I’m your slave. My name is Eliezer.

421
00:37:48,688 --> 00:37:52,794
No, no. Please, please, please.
No, no, no.

422
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:57,579
You are free.
You are free to go where you choose.

423
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:01,047
I'll give you what you need
to reach Haran.

424
00:38:01,207 --> 00:38:04,596
l have a brother there who may have
work for an educated man.

425
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:08,024
l can never repay you.

426
00:38:09,938 --> 00:38:12,290
But you have my lifelong gratitude...

427
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:15,560
...and l want to give you this
small piece of advice:

428
00:38:16,158 --> 00:38:17,872
Turn back.

429
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:27,441
Stay the night with us. Eat and rest.

430
00:39:26,727 --> 00:39:28,482
Uncle.

431
00:39:45,825 --> 00:39:49,932
Haran is probably worse than Damascus.

432
00:39:52,643 --> 00:39:54,317
One question, please.

433
00:39:55,195 --> 00:39:58,145
Why are we traveling south?

434
00:41:04,369 --> 00:41:06,282
O my God...

435
00:41:09,352 --> 00:41:12,981
...with all my heart, l give thanks.

436
00:41:14,177 --> 00:41:18,084
l have seen it as you have shown it to me.

437
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:21,911
Canaan.

438
00:41:22,749 --> 00:41:24,184
This...

439
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,972
...is the land of promise.

440
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:09,022
This piece of paradise...

441
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:14,006
...is no accident.
The hand of man is everywhere.

442
00:42:17,754 --> 00:42:20,664
We are not alone here in Canaan.

443
00:42:20,824 --> 00:42:23,376
Take what men you can spare...

444
00:42:24,213 --> 00:42:28,200
...and form a circle right around
this valley, and we--

445
00:42:36,493 --> 00:42:39,403
I am Mambre the Amorite.

446
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:41,995
And these are my two brothers.

447
00:42:42,154 --> 00:42:44,028
l am Abram.

448
00:42:44,188 --> 00:42:48,613
This is my nephew Lot.
These are my people.

449
00:42:48,773 --> 00:42:51,005
And this valley is our land.

450
00:42:51,165 --> 00:42:53,079
And your people are on it.

451
00:42:53,238 --> 00:42:56,946
-It is a well-tended valley.
-Yes, it is.

452
00:42:57,105 --> 00:42:59,936
Because my father's father's father...

453
00:43:00,335 --> 00:43:02,368
...dug for water here...

454
00:43:02,807 --> 00:43:06,036
...and he found a river under the earth.

455
00:43:06,475 --> 00:43:08,229
Now it flows above.

456
00:43:08,907 --> 00:43:12,615
And my father's father planted these trees.

457
00:43:12,774 --> 00:43:16,642
And my father dammed the water
to make the lake...

458
00:43:16,841 --> 00:43:18,954
...where your animals now drink.

459
00:43:19,592 --> 00:43:22,662
Now there's not much work
for you and your brothers to do.

460
00:43:22,822 --> 00:43:26,051
Oh, yes. We defend it.

461
00:43:31,114 --> 00:43:33,068
Uncle Abram.

462
00:43:37,095 --> 00:43:40,843
We have the advantage. The land's good
here. People are tired of wandering.

463
00:43:41,162 --> 00:43:44,351
Let's take the place now.
We can defend it as well as any.

464
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:46,424
First we kill these men?

465
00:43:49,973 --> 00:43:54,558
-lf necessary.
-Oh, it would be necessary.

466
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:02,691
My nephew believes we have
the advantage.

467
00:44:06,997 --> 00:44:09,748
Your nephew is good with numbers.

468
00:44:10,426 --> 00:44:13,536
Now we'll see if he knows
how to use them.

469
00:44:16,805 --> 00:44:18,201
No!

470
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,194
There is no justice between men...

471
00:44:20,354 --> 00:44:23,902
...if our differences are measured
in numbers and in blood.

472
00:44:35,544 --> 00:44:37,219
Your father...

473
00:44:37,378 --> 00:44:40,687
...and his father and his father
made this valley green.

474
00:44:42,641 --> 00:44:44,236
This land is yours.

475
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:48,263
We will leave in peace.

476
00:44:54,163 --> 00:44:57,552
Gather the herds.
We're going back to our valley.

477
00:47:12,232 --> 00:47:14,067
My Lord God.

478
00:47:14,505 --> 00:47:16,499
You have led me here.

479
00:47:16,738 --> 00:47:19,489
You have given me the land
that you have promised.

480
00:47:19,648 --> 00:47:22,439
But why are you taking it away now?

481
00:47:23,914 --> 00:47:28,021
l have brought with me
the hope of my people.

482
00:47:29,297 --> 00:47:31,171
But how do l feed them?

483
00:47:33,284 --> 00:47:36,872
Shall l remain here?
Shall l take them away?

484
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:41,377
But where, Lord? Where? Where?

485
00:47:42,175 --> 00:47:44,088
Tell me what to do.

486
00:47:46,042 --> 00:47:48,036
l am your servant.

487
00:47:48,594 --> 00:47:50,707
But how can l serve you?

488
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:54,335
How am l to serve you?

489
00:48:16,503 --> 00:48:18,257
O my Lord...

490
00:48:19,573 --> 00:48:21,805
...do not abandon me.

491
00:48:40,185 --> 00:48:41,780
l speak to him...

492
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:44,252
...and he will not answer.

493
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:47,362
This is a mysterious god.

494
00:48:47,521 --> 00:48:50,193
He wanted us to come here. We did.

495
00:48:50,631 --> 00:48:52,864
He showed me Canaan as it will be.

496
00:48:53,023 --> 00:48:56,054
He said he would make our people
a great nation.

497
00:48:56,492 --> 00:48:58,605
But how do we exist until then?

498
00:48:59,084 --> 00:49:02,792
He will provide. He made me a promise.

499
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:06,220
He cannot be untrue to that promise.

500
00:49:07,735 --> 00:49:09,211
Last night...

501
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:11,922
...in the tent next to ours, a child died.

502
00:49:12,081 --> 00:49:13,875
-l know.
-The animals are wailing.

503
00:49:14,035 --> 00:49:15,630
-l know.
-The land has dried up.

504
00:49:15,789 --> 00:49:17,783
-l know.
-How can you follow this god?

505
00:49:19,417 --> 00:49:22,687
l do. l can. And l will.

506
00:49:41,784 --> 00:49:43,339
Not you.

507
00:49:44,296 --> 00:49:45,731
Not you too.

508
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:50,037
lf Canaan is the home
that he has promised us...

509
00:49:50,436 --> 00:49:51,991
...and we leave...

510
00:49:53,705 --> 00:49:55,818
...will he not be displeased?

511
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:59,606
Will he not abandon us?

512
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:03,792
But if we stay....

513
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:07,221
We will starve.

514
00:50:15,594 --> 00:50:17,388
What if...?

515
00:50:19,063 --> 00:50:21,375
What if Canaan is not...?

516
00:50:40,034 --> 00:50:41,669
We will not die here.

517
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:46,812
We will not die here.

518
00:52:51,445 --> 00:52:53,199
My people.

519
00:52:54,515 --> 00:52:57,705
What am l doing?
What have l done?

520
00:52:57,984 --> 00:52:59,698
Stay with it.

521
00:53:00,256 --> 00:53:03,526
-Stay with your faith.
-Faith?

522
00:53:12,935 --> 00:53:15,486
Uncle, we must find water and grass soon.

523
00:53:15,686 --> 00:53:18,756
There's plenty of both not far from here.

524
00:53:19,872 --> 00:53:21,826
l traveled through here once...

525
00:53:21,985 --> 00:53:25,095
...with a caravan of merchants
carrying spices.

526
00:53:25,494 --> 00:53:27,447
Spices to where?

527
00:53:28,085 --> 00:53:32,032
To Egypt. The land of the great river Nile.

528
00:53:33,069 --> 00:53:34,664
It’s a very fertile place.

529
00:53:34,823 --> 00:53:38,491
-Maybe that's where we should be going.
-That may not be so easy.

530
00:53:39,129 --> 00:53:42,877
Egypt is ruled by a terrible tyrant
they call Pharaoh.

531
00:53:43,914 --> 00:53:47,701
He watches over his land
like a jealous husband.

532
00:53:47,901 --> 00:53:49,974
Could there not be an oasis...

533
00:53:50,133 --> 00:53:54,280
...a fertile valley, anything,
between here and that Pharaoh?

534
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:56,194
Nothing.

535
00:53:56,672 --> 00:54:00,818
The desert remains harsh
and unfriendly all the way.

536
00:54:06,759 --> 00:54:09,909
We will go on to this...

537
00:54:11,105 --> 00:54:14,215
...land of the river Nile.

538
00:54:16,766 --> 00:54:18,640
We will go on.

539
00:55:31,388 --> 00:55:32,823
Abram.

540
00:55:35,853 --> 00:55:37,009
Abram.

541
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:39,362
I’ve just been told by someone up ahead...

542
00:55:39,521 --> 00:55:42,551
...that you may have a greater problem
than we imagined.

543
00:55:42,711 --> 00:55:45,143
It seems this Pharaoh...

544
00:55:45,302 --> 00:55:47,734
...has a lust for beautiful women.

545
00:55:48,213 --> 00:55:50,725
He pays great rewards for men
who supply them.

546
00:55:50,924 --> 00:55:53,755
-Are there no laws?
-Oh, yes.

547
00:55:53,914 --> 00:55:58,579
In fact, Egyptians are very strict
about such matters.

548
00:55:59,376 --> 00:56:02,367
It’s forbidden by law for a man
to take the wife of another.

549
00:56:02,685 --> 00:56:03,961
And so?

550
00:56:04,121 --> 00:56:06,832
The Pharaoh has found
a way around the law.

551
00:56:07,669 --> 00:56:09,862
He kills the husband.

552
00:56:21,065 --> 00:56:23,896
l am not the kind of woman
a king would want.

553
00:56:33,545 --> 00:56:36,057
-You are?
-Abram.

554
00:56:36,216 --> 00:56:38,409
Son of Terah.

555
00:56:39,206 --> 00:56:42,595
-And these are?
-These are my people.

556
00:56:43,871 --> 00:56:47,300
Do you think you could be
a little more precise than that?

557
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:52,124
Yes. Lot, son of Haran, my nephew.

558
00:56:52,642 --> 00:56:55,154
Eliezer of Damascus.

559
00:56:55,314 --> 00:56:59,101
Sarai, daughter of Terah...

560
00:57:00,178 --> 00:57:05,361
-...my sister, and--
-Enough, enough, enough, just count them.

561
00:57:07,713 --> 00:57:10,145
Fifty-three now.

562
00:57:10,305 --> 00:57:12,458
What do you want in Egypt?

563
00:57:12,617 --> 00:57:16,365
We'd like to rest a while.
Pasture the animals. Trade.

564
00:57:16,524 --> 00:57:18,319
-Trade?
-Yes, trade.

565
00:57:19,435 --> 00:57:20,591
Trade what?

566
00:57:20,751 --> 00:57:25,655
We spin wool and tan hides,
make tunics, cheese, sandals--

567
00:57:25,814 --> 00:57:27,768
-You're a little late.
-Late?

568
00:57:27,927 --> 00:57:31,874
Late. Egypt's choking with nomads
and their filthy sheep.

569
00:57:32,831 --> 00:57:35,821
The hills look like maggots crawling
on a dung heap.

570
00:57:37,775 --> 00:57:39,729
Permission to enter...

571
00:57:40,606 --> 00:57:42,201
...denied.

572
00:57:43,756 --> 00:57:46,387
-Denied?
-Denied.

573
00:58:08,116 --> 00:58:09,950
You. Wait.

574
00:58:17,406 --> 00:58:20,675
A bit warm for all this, don't you think?

575
00:58:32,078 --> 00:58:35,148
And for your crimes of theft
against this merchant...

576
00:58:35,307 --> 00:58:39,015
...it is the judgment of our
Pharaoh that justice will prevail.

577
00:58:39,175 --> 00:58:41,607
Cut off their hands.

578
00:58:55,162 --> 00:58:57,634
Lovely, yes.

579
00:58:59,947 --> 00:59:02,179
Lovely woman.

580
00:59:30,447 --> 00:59:33,278
Now, then, you.

581
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:38,979
You are the brother, is that correct?

582
00:59:40,375 --> 00:59:43,843
And your people are shepherds,
are they not?

583
00:59:45,319 --> 00:59:46,874
Splendid.

584
00:59:47,113 --> 00:59:50,980
You will be given two score of sheep,
one score of cattle...

585
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:54,090
...oxen and carts filled with food,
tents and so forth...

586
00:59:54,249 --> 00:59:58,715
...plus grazing land in the delta. You will
obey Egyptian laws, pay Egyptian taxes...

587
00:59:58,874 --> 01:00:00,788
...worship Egyptian gods.

588
01:00:00,987 --> 01:00:04,297
Your sister is now a member
of the Pharaoh's household.

589
01:00:05,333 --> 01:00:09,241
l know. l know, it's a ridiculously
large reward.

590
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:13,267
Almost embarrassing, isn't it?
But no need for thanks.

591
01:00:13,826 --> 01:00:17,932
The Pharaoh's generosity is as boundless
as the light of the sun.

592
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:21,082
Welcome to Egypt. Enjoy your stay.

593
01:00:26,084 --> 01:00:30,908
Lot, bring in the tribe.
Get them water, food.

594
01:00:31,546 --> 01:00:32,902
Take care of them.

595
01:00:33,779 --> 01:00:37,048
Eliezer, we've got to get her out.

596
01:00:37,527 --> 01:00:41,434
We've got to try. Find out if she's guarded,
how many guards.

597
01:00:41,593 --> 01:00:44,065
I’ll try my best. Be careful.

598
01:00:46,218 --> 01:00:49,487
No, no, no. Don't move.
I’ve almost finished.

599
01:00:51,601 --> 01:00:55,149
l know, it's so thick, you can
hardly keep your eyes open.

600
01:00:55,707 --> 01:00:57,820
But even the men around here use it.

601
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:01,648
Everybody looks like everybody else:
half-awake.

602
01:01:02,684 --> 01:01:04,359
Even the Pharaoh?

603
01:01:04,518 --> 01:01:06,711
I’ve only seen the Pharaoh twice.

604
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:08,944
The first day they brought me here...

605
01:01:09,103 --> 01:01:11,456
...and when he decided
l was to be your slave.

606
01:01:11,615 --> 01:01:13,409
His first gift to you.

607
01:01:14,366 --> 01:01:16,719
-What is he like?
-Well...

608
01:01:16,878 --> 01:01:19,151
...the priests say he's a living god.

609
01:01:19,310 --> 01:01:21,343
l thought he was more like...

610
01:01:21,822 --> 01:01:23,098
...a man.

611
01:01:23,576 --> 01:01:26,287
A very cruel man sometimes.

612
01:01:26,686 --> 01:01:29,437
-What's your name?
-Hagar.

613
01:01:29,597 --> 01:01:33,185
-How did you come here?
-My father lost his farm.

614
01:01:33,344 --> 01:01:37,371
He had debts. I’m the payment.

615
01:01:38,607 --> 01:01:41,159
-Do you have to stay long?
-Mistress...

616
01:01:41,597 --> 01:01:44,109
...no one ever leaves.

617
01:01:47,618 --> 01:01:51,804
We are racing to get you ready,
but it might be weeks before he wants you.

618
01:01:51,963 --> 01:01:54,435
Then, if you don't resist...

619
01:01:54,595 --> 01:01:56,549
...the worst thing that happens...

620
01:01:56,708 --> 01:02:00,695
...is the usual thing that happens
between a man and a woman.

621
01:03:08,274 --> 01:03:10,985
lf you do, l will too.

622
01:03:11,863 --> 01:03:13,457
And did you?

623
01:03:55,082 --> 01:03:57,474
They were wrong as usual.

624
01:03:58,431 --> 01:04:01,102
l was told you were
one of the most beautiful women...

625
01:04:01,261 --> 01:04:03,215
...ever to arrive from the desert.

626
01:04:03,374 --> 01:04:04,929
But they were wrong.

627
01:04:05,288 --> 01:04:09,634
You're one of the most beautiful women
to arrive from anywhere.

628
01:04:13,701 --> 01:04:15,016
Come.

629
01:04:19,482 --> 01:04:21,236
Sit down.

630
01:04:33,117 --> 01:04:34,752
What are you thinking?

631
01:04:39,497 --> 01:04:41,211
Are you afraid to answer?

632
01:04:42,287 --> 01:04:45,397
I’ve never punished anyone
for their thoughts.

633
01:04:47,311 --> 01:04:50,421
Are you thinking what's going to happen
between us?

634
01:04:52,654 --> 01:04:54,448
Nothing will happen.

635
01:04:54,886 --> 01:04:57,597
Nothing you don't want to happen.

636
01:04:59,950 --> 01:05:01,824
You don't believe me?

637
01:05:10,914 --> 01:05:12,868
You're very lovely.

638
01:05:13,944 --> 01:05:17,851
But there are many,
many beautiful women around me.

639
01:05:20,483 --> 01:05:22,994
And l am quite powerful.

640
01:05:26,184 --> 01:05:29,812
But the mere exercise of power...

641
01:05:29,972 --> 01:05:32,204
...l find boring.

642
01:05:36,590 --> 01:05:38,743
l hope we are going to be friends.

643
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:42,890
lf we are to be more than friends,
that's something...

644
01:05:44,883 --> 01:05:46,916
...you will decide.

645
01:05:50,265 --> 01:05:53,256
Now it's time for my prayers.

646
01:05:56,924 --> 01:06:01,309
I’m a god in exile on this earth.

647
01:06:01,628 --> 01:06:03,662
Sometimes...

648
01:06:03,821 --> 01:06:09,164
...l need to ask my heavenly brothers
for their advice.

649
01:06:18,493 --> 01:06:24,434
And in addition, the Pharaoh insists any
further discrepancies will not be tolerated.

650
01:06:24,593 --> 01:06:30,255
The Pharaoh is displeased and will not
condone any further discrepancies.

651
01:06:30,414 --> 01:06:33,205
Such conduct is deplorable.

652
01:06:33,365 --> 01:06:34,999
We await your immediate reply.

653
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:36,754
Eliezer.

654
01:06:39,385 --> 01:06:40,661
Abram.

655
01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:43,691
Please. Come away.

656
01:06:44,847 --> 01:06:49,791
Remain here, and your life won't be worth
more than an Egyptian arrow.

657
01:06:49,951 --> 01:06:54,894
She's too well-guarded. I’ve tried to bribe
a man who said he had friends at court.

658
01:06:55,293 --> 01:06:57,486
He vanished with my silver.

659
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:01,574
Abram...

660
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:06,717
...don't forget you're responsible
for many others.

661
01:07:06,877 --> 01:07:08,711
They still need you.

662
01:07:10,067 --> 01:07:13,336
Sarai is lost to you and us.

663
01:07:17,004 --> 01:07:19,476
We all mourn her.

664
01:07:19,635 --> 01:07:24,739
But it's time you look
at reality in its cruel face.

665
01:07:25,097 --> 01:07:28,088
Sarai belongs to the man
they call Pharaoh...

666
01:07:28,247 --> 01:07:30,560
...a god in his own right.

667
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:35,304
Sarai is mine.

668
01:07:35,464 --> 01:07:38,055
She will always be mine.
Only mine.

669
01:07:38,215 --> 01:07:40,926
How dare you presume to be wiser
than God!

670
01:07:43,438 --> 01:07:44,713
He knows my heart.

671
01:07:44,873 --> 01:07:47,345
He knows it would be better
to have me killed...

672
01:07:47,504 --> 01:07:49,777
...than sentence me to a life without her.

673
01:07:50,136 --> 01:07:51,332
Go.

674
01:07:51,850 --> 01:07:53,206
Leave.

675
01:07:53,365 --> 01:07:54,800
Leave me...

676
01:07:56,754 --> 01:07:58,349
...alone.

677
01:08:08,994 --> 01:08:11,028
And there...

678
01:08:11,187 --> 01:08:13,579
...I’m having a storehouse built.

679
01:08:13,978 --> 01:08:16,450
And I’m giving them a school.

680
01:08:16,848 --> 01:08:18,084
A school?

681
01:08:18,244 --> 01:08:23,188
A school. I’ve built schools
from Nubia to the delta.

682
01:08:23,586 --> 01:08:27,693
Uneducated people make a weak nation.

683
01:08:28,012 --> 01:08:31,321
And this is something very interesting.

684
01:08:41,209 --> 01:08:42,963
What is that?

685
01:08:43,402 --> 01:08:45,076
It looks like a mountain.

686
01:08:45,236 --> 01:08:47,588
It will be as high as a mountain.

687
01:08:48,346 --> 01:08:50,578
And large enough.

688
01:08:51,097 --> 01:08:54,884
-To do what?
-To stop the rush of time.

689
01:08:56,041 --> 01:09:01,104
A pyramid is like a dam
on the flowing river of time.

690
01:09:01,263 --> 01:09:06,766
Inside, there will be a chamber,
a place of eternal being...

691
01:09:06,925 --> 01:09:10,513
...where nothing can change,
time cannot erode.

692
01:09:10,673 --> 01:09:13,743
There, l will have eternal life.

693
01:09:15,298 --> 01:09:16,972
Your tomb.

694
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:21,996
Yes. For some time in the distant future.

695
01:09:23,312 --> 01:09:28,614
For now it is a stronghold
to guard my present.

696
01:09:33,837 --> 01:09:36,867
A present l would like to offer you.

697
01:09:42,449 --> 01:09:45,559
My needs are simpler than that.

698
01:09:47,034 --> 01:09:49,426
What are your needs?

699
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:53,134
Tell me.

700
01:09:55,008 --> 01:09:57,281
What do you want?

701
01:09:57,919 --> 01:09:59,832
Anything.

702
01:10:01,387 --> 01:10:02,743
Anything?

703
01:10:04,457 --> 01:10:06,690
Anything within my power.

704
01:10:09,401 --> 01:10:11,753
l want to see my family.

705
01:10:11,993 --> 01:10:13,667
My brother.

706
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:16,976
l want to go back to my people.

707
01:11:10,203 --> 01:11:12,196
Mistress...

708
01:11:14,349 --> 01:11:17,977
...l thought maybe you would like
a taste of our dates.

709
01:11:23,798 --> 01:11:25,034
You're hurt.

710
01:11:26,071 --> 01:11:27,626
No.

711
01:11:30,935 --> 01:11:32,450
Yes.

712
01:11:34,922 --> 01:11:36,517
He's...

713
01:11:37,274 --> 01:11:39,108
...playing with me...

714
01:11:40,224 --> 01:11:41,500
...torturing me.

715
01:11:41,660 --> 01:11:45,687
He's trying to tear me away
from my own heart.

716
01:11:46,045 --> 01:11:47,800
Did the Pharaoh threaten you?

717
01:11:48,797 --> 01:11:50,670
He shows me kindness.

718
01:11:51,548 --> 01:11:54,099
He treats you like he's treated
no one else before.

719
01:11:54,259 --> 01:11:56,691
And he's been very generous
to your people.

720
01:11:58,166 --> 01:12:00,718
I’m grateful to him for that...

721
01:12:01,236 --> 01:12:05,303
...but l hate myself for how
it makes me feel.

722
01:12:07,416 --> 01:12:10,286
By resisting him, l keep my pride...

723
01:12:10,805 --> 01:12:13,077
...but it hurts me to think...

724
01:12:13,237 --> 01:12:16,984
...that I’m endangering my people.
His anger could fall on them.

725
01:12:21,131 --> 01:12:22,766
Tell me...

726
01:12:23,683 --> 01:12:26,912
-...has any woman ever escaped--?
-Escaped from here?

727
01:12:28,307 --> 01:12:29,703
No.

728
01:12:30,022 --> 01:12:31,736
They try...

729
01:12:31,976 --> 01:12:33,530
...but they don't succeed.

730
01:13:08,257 --> 01:13:11,526
Bring water. Call the doctor. Quickly.

731
01:13:11,686 --> 01:13:15,673
-Your Divine Majesty has had a dream?
-l have.

732
01:13:16,550 --> 01:13:19,102
-Tell me your dream...
-I’m in pain. I’m burning!

733
01:13:19,261 --> 01:13:23,487
-...that l may render its meaning.
-Help me. I’m burning. I’m in pain!

734
01:13:23,647 --> 01:13:25,361
A sign of how deeply you dream.

735
01:13:25,561 --> 01:13:29,388
-Your Majesty, l--
-It’s not a dream. I’m on fire!

736
01:13:29,548 --> 01:13:31,740
My Pharaoh, you too?

737
01:13:33,535 --> 01:13:35,488
Your wives, your children.

738
01:13:35,648 --> 01:13:37,522
They are, like you, all afflicted.

739
01:13:37,681 --> 01:13:39,196
I’ve been poisoned.

740
01:13:39,356 --> 01:13:42,027
Someone has poisoned
me and my family.

741
01:13:42,386 --> 01:13:44,618
But who, Majesty?

742
01:13:45,177 --> 01:13:47,848
How should l know who?
But whoever it is...

743
01:13:48,007 --> 01:13:52,034
...kill him! Kill them! Kill them!
Kill them!

744
01:14:10,215 --> 01:14:15,159
It burns, it burns, you incompetent idiot!

745
01:14:15,318 --> 01:14:17,232
We're doing what we can, my Pharaoh.

746
01:14:17,511 --> 01:14:18,787
Get me out.

747
01:14:18,946 --> 01:14:21,020
Get me out. Get me out.

748
01:14:21,179 --> 01:14:26,282
It is possible, Majesty, a divine power,
a god unknown to us...

749
01:14:26,442 --> 01:14:28,395
...has unleashed his curse.

750
01:14:28,555 --> 01:14:31,984
Curse? What curse? A god unknown to us?
A god unknown to me?

751
01:14:32,143 --> 01:14:33,778
-I’m the only god.
-Your Majesty.

752
01:14:33,937 --> 01:14:36,330
The affliction is spreading
among our populace.

753
01:14:36,529 --> 01:14:38,801
Panic is building.
It’s affecting more people.

754
01:14:38,961 --> 01:14:41,154
Our doctors are becoming desperate.

755
01:14:42,270 --> 01:14:46,417
Pharaoh, l suspect this may be the curse
of a foreign god...

756
01:14:46,576 --> 01:14:49,247
...a god who has journeyed here
with foreigners.

757
01:14:49,407 --> 01:14:52,716
Perhaps the desert people
we've allowed to enter Egypt.

758
01:14:53,394 --> 01:14:55,188
The desert people?

759
01:14:55,507 --> 01:14:57,540
You mean the people of the woman Sarai?

760
01:14:57,740 --> 01:14:59,494
Yes, Majesty.

761
01:15:01,886 --> 01:15:03,600
Majesty...

762
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:05,474
...we have learned something...

763
01:15:05,634 --> 01:15:08,504
...that may explain the wrath
of the god of these nomads.

764
01:15:08,664 --> 01:15:11,893
A god under whose protection
the woman called Sarai might be.

765
01:15:12,252 --> 01:15:14,764
We have arrested the leader of her people.

766
01:15:15,043 --> 01:15:17,993
-Her brother.
-Her husband, Your Majesty.

767
01:15:27,203 --> 01:15:30,473
We should exterminate them. Kill them all.

768
01:15:30,632 --> 01:15:33,902
The men, the women, the children.

769
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:36,732
The entire filthy tribe.

770
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:43,151
Have him brought here at once.

771
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:47,617
-Let him come in.
-In.

772
01:16:03,445 --> 01:16:05,478
On your knees.

773
01:16:07,352 --> 01:16:09,465
l said, on your knees.

774
01:16:10,701 --> 01:16:12,496
Let him stand.

775
01:16:13,293 --> 01:16:14,848
Come close.

776
01:16:15,167 --> 01:16:17,798
l can't see you. Come closer.

777
01:16:28,523 --> 01:16:30,796
You see what you have done to me.

778
01:16:30,955 --> 01:16:32,789
To my family and my people.

779
01:16:33,467 --> 01:16:38,690
By your deceit,
some god has taken revenge...

780
01:16:38,969 --> 01:16:42,836
...for an offense of which I’m innocent.

781
01:16:43,275 --> 01:16:44,870
Why...

782
01:16:45,348 --> 01:16:48,378
...did you lie to us?
Why did you say she's your sister?

783
01:16:48,578 --> 01:16:50,611
Why? Why?

784
01:16:50,850 --> 01:16:52,365
l lied.

785
01:16:53,522 --> 01:16:57,788
But to my God, it is a greater offense
to kill a man and steal his wife...

786
01:16:57,987 --> 01:17:00,020
...than it is to lie.

787
01:17:00,499 --> 01:17:02,054
What...

788
01:17:02,293 --> 01:17:03,728
...god?

789
01:17:03,888 --> 01:17:06,798
A strange god. What...?

790
01:17:07,237 --> 01:17:10,387
What sort of mysterious god...

791
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:11,981
...is he?

792
01:17:12,659 --> 01:17:17,244
Strange, yes. And mysterious.

793
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:23,225
-He has spoken to me and--
-He has spoken to you?

794
01:17:23,464 --> 01:17:24,899
Yes.

795
01:17:25,258 --> 01:17:27,929
-How?
-In here.

796
01:17:28,408 --> 01:17:31,358
He has guided my people.

797
01:17:31,518 --> 01:17:34,906
He's guided you into my Egypt? Why?

798
01:17:35,265 --> 01:17:36,860
Why?

799
01:17:37,618 --> 01:17:39,332
l don't know.

800
01:17:39,691 --> 01:17:41,326
l don't know even if he has.

801
01:17:41,485 --> 01:17:44,236
You see? You don't know.

802
01:17:44,475 --> 01:17:47,864
It’s all imagination.
It’s all your fantasy.

803
01:17:48,263 --> 01:17:50,097
Oh, what sort of a god is that?

804
01:17:50,256 --> 01:17:55,798
Do you think it's just that we have
to suffer, the people, my family and me...

805
01:17:55,958 --> 01:17:57,553
...because of your lie?

806
01:17:57,712 --> 01:18:01,221
Can't he take this curse off us?

807
01:18:01,579 --> 01:18:05,168
-Who are you?
-Abram, a shepherd.

808
01:18:05,327 --> 01:18:06,802
A shepherd.

809
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:08,995
Where is Sarai?

810
01:18:09,513 --> 01:18:11,946
Your wife is my property.

811
01:18:12,464 --> 01:18:14,298
She is...

812
01:18:15,534 --> 01:18:19,441
...in my household.
Your god has sent her to me.

813
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:21,833
-To me.
-There are many things...

814
01:18:21,993 --> 01:18:24,863
...of which l am uncertain,
but one thing l am certain of:

815
01:18:25,063 --> 01:18:27,375
That my God did not send her to you.

816
01:18:29,129 --> 01:18:30,485
Look to her.

817
01:18:30,844 --> 01:18:33,794
Is she not without affliction?

818
01:18:34,631 --> 01:18:37,143
My God said, ''l will bless those
who bless you...

819
01:18:37,303 --> 01:18:40,811
...and l will curse those who curse you.''

820
01:18:42,885 --> 01:18:44,599
Look to her.

821
01:18:49,623 --> 01:18:50,938
Take him away.

822
01:18:55,244 --> 01:18:56,759
Wait!

823
01:19:06,129 --> 01:19:10,793
l don't want to challenge
your god anymore.

824
01:19:11,910 --> 01:19:14,860
Thus the Pharaoh decides:

825
01:19:17,531 --> 01:19:19,485
Take your wife...

826
01:19:19,884 --> 01:19:25,784
...the slaves l gave her, take everything
I’ve given you and your people...

827
01:19:27,140 --> 01:19:31,685
...everything you have touched,
and be gone from my sight.

828
01:19:34,157 --> 01:19:36,310
Out of Egypt.

829
01:19:36,988 --> 01:19:40,058
Then take your contamination with you.

830
01:19:40,496 --> 01:19:41,772
Go.

831
01:19:56,006 --> 01:19:59,235
Out. Out. Keep moving!

832
01:19:59,395 --> 01:20:01,827
Don't touch them.
Beware of the affliction!

833
01:20:02,345 --> 01:20:05,016
Come on! Hurry up!

834
01:20:05,216 --> 01:20:07,688
Out! Keep moving!

835
01:20:15,582 --> 01:20:18,213
Get those stinking dogs out of here.

836
01:20:21,323 --> 01:20:23,317
Get back, don't touch them!

837
01:20:23,556 --> 01:20:24,951
Out.

838
01:20:25,111 --> 01:20:26,785
Out.

839
01:20:27,862 --> 01:20:30,932
And may you all rot in the desert!

840
01:22:17,528 --> 01:22:19,402
We've found it!

841
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:20,877
Water!

842
01:22:21,355 --> 01:22:22,910
Water!

843
01:22:29,455 --> 01:22:30,731
Abram...

844
01:22:30,891 --> 01:22:33,642
...Lot's discovered water, and he--

845
01:22:52,467 --> 01:22:55,656
-You're back, Abram.
-We are home, Mambre.

846
01:22:55,975 --> 01:22:58,766
-And you are digging wells.
-We will need water.

847
01:23:00,545 --> 01:23:03,456
-And you have found more?
-Much more.

848
01:23:03,615 --> 01:23:06,007
And we will share it with our neighbors.

849
01:23:07,841 --> 01:23:09,835
And as our neighbors...

850
01:23:09,994 --> 01:23:14,460
...our friends are your friends,
and our enemies are your enemies?

851
01:23:15,819 --> 01:23:17,134
Yes.

852
01:23:17,414 --> 01:23:19,008
So be it.

853
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:53,217
Stop!

854
01:24:01,866 --> 01:24:03,740
You stop it as well!

855
01:24:06,372 --> 01:24:09,202
What have you done?
You could have killed him.

856
01:24:09,362 --> 01:24:11,555
Lot's men won't let us water
our herds here.

857
01:24:15,128 --> 01:24:17,201
Have you lost your minds?

858
01:24:17,361 --> 01:24:20,231
We are one family.
The water is for all of us.

859
01:24:20,391 --> 01:24:23,301
l am ashamed of you, all of you.

860
01:24:24,896 --> 01:24:29,003
And l hope that you are ashamed
of yourselves.

861
01:24:30,199 --> 01:24:31,634
-My fellow--
-But Lot's men--

862
01:24:33,294 --> 01:24:36,403
Violence will not solve problems.

863
01:24:38,875 --> 01:24:41,427
Now, the pastures beyond that river...

864
01:24:41,586 --> 01:24:44,098
...are overgrazed and turning brown.

865
01:24:44,258 --> 01:24:48,683
lf we do not leave enough grass,
the spring rains will wash away the soil.

866
01:24:50,383 --> 01:24:52,256
Then l must move my herds.

867
01:24:52,615 --> 01:24:55,606
-Move your herds?
-Uncle...

868
01:24:56,483 --> 01:24:59,712
...l prefer to keep what's yours
and what's mine apart.

869
01:25:00,430 --> 01:25:03,300
lf they're mixed,
it makes the counting more difficult.

870
01:25:06,595 --> 01:25:08,070
The counting?

871
01:25:08,708 --> 01:25:14,369
Ah, yes, of course, of course.
The counting is important.

872
01:25:16,529 --> 01:25:18,562
There isn't enough water
for our herds.

873
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:21,154
The land is too small for both of us.

874
01:25:21,313 --> 01:25:25,619
With respect, Lot, by dividing our people,
we grow weaker.

875
01:25:25,778 --> 01:25:28,968
Well, of course, you are free to choose.

876
01:25:31,265 --> 01:25:33,578
lf you go to the right,
l will go to the left.

877
01:25:33,737 --> 01:25:36,329
lf you choose the left,
l will go to the right.

878
01:25:38,243 --> 01:25:42,588
Beyond that hill, there are green pastures
along the river called the Jordan.

879
01:25:42,868 --> 01:25:44,462
And there are cities.

880
01:25:46,162 --> 01:25:48,394
l can go there to trade wool and skins.

881
01:25:48,554 --> 01:25:51,504
But those merchants come here
to trade with us.

882
01:25:51,664 --> 01:25:55,571
Yes. And they pay us less,
whereas if l make the journey to them...

883
01:25:55,730 --> 01:25:57,804
...then l can get a better price.

884
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:03,067
Price? A better price? Oh, yes.

885
01:26:05,625 --> 01:26:07,499
Yes, of course.

886
01:26:07,778 --> 01:26:10,289
Price is important.

887
01:26:14,835 --> 01:26:17,665
Well, so be it. You go, then.

888
01:26:19,484 --> 01:26:20,999
l will miss you.

889
01:26:21,358 --> 01:26:23,272
l hope it brings you what you want.

890
01:26:23,471 --> 01:26:24,787
But be cautious.

891
01:26:24,947 --> 01:26:28,375
l have seen many cities,
some better, some worse.

892
01:26:28,535 --> 01:26:31,724
In none, however,
have l felt a sense of fulfillment.

893
01:26:33,884 --> 01:26:36,914
So keep your people outside the gates.

894
01:26:40,143 --> 01:26:42,177
Thank you, uncle.

895
01:26:43,811 --> 01:26:45,685
Gather the herds. We're going.

896
01:26:55,518 --> 01:26:57,711
He is my brother's son.

897
01:26:58,070 --> 01:27:00,023
But he is like my own.

898
01:27:00,263 --> 01:27:02,336
May God protect him.

899
01:27:28,439 --> 01:27:31,708
The four kings! The four kings!

900
01:27:34,662 --> 01:27:39,008
They attacked Sodom. The four kings.
They're coming.

901
01:27:40,207 --> 01:27:41,244
Get some water.

902
01:28:07,810 --> 01:28:10,082
Are you attempting to save this one's life?

903
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:11,996
How very kind of you.

904
01:28:56,007 --> 01:28:57,562
To whom do you owe allegiance?

905
01:28:57,761 --> 01:29:00,313
To Abram, the son of Terah.

906
01:29:00,473 --> 01:29:02,665
But you're in the land
of the King of Sodom.

907
01:29:02,984 --> 01:29:05,018
For the water, the grass.

908
01:29:06,177 --> 01:29:08,290
Good, is it? Well, you're wrong.

909
01:29:08,450 --> 01:29:10,403
The grass of Sodom
is as bitter as bile.

910
01:29:10,563 --> 01:29:12,836
But soon it'll taste sweet...

911
01:29:14,633 --> 01:29:16,786
...when we water it with blood.

912
01:29:20,776 --> 01:29:23,567
Seize tents, goods, animals.
Everything you can find.

913
01:29:23,726 --> 01:29:25,401
These people have--

914
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:26,956
Shepherd...

915
01:29:27,235 --> 01:29:29,747
...you're moving to greener pastures.

916
01:29:34,614 --> 01:29:37,046
Take them north as slaves.

917
01:29:37,325 --> 01:29:39,199
Father--!

918
01:29:40,794 --> 01:29:43,625
-Mother!
-My child.
