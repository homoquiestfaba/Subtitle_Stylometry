1
00:00:01,348 --> 00:00:02,781
You're going back and forth.

2
00:00:02,883 --> 00:00:04,510
You never go back and forth
with a mop.

3
00:00:04,618 --> 00:00:06,950
You go side to side to side.

4
00:00:07,054 --> 00:00:08,646
Where did you learn to mop?

5
00:00:08,822 --> 00:00:10,255
You filled out an application.

6
00:00:10,357 --> 00:00:12,552
Didn't I ask you
when you took this job?

7
00:00:12,659 --> 00:00:15,423
"I know how to mop.
Yes, I know how to mop."

8
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:17,520
But you don't. You don't.

9
00:00:17,631 --> 00:00:18,893
This is how we mop at home.

10
00:00:18,999 --> 00:00:21,627
Well, it's not how we mop here, lad.

11
00:00:21,735 --> 00:00:24,829
It is not how we mop here, all right?

12
00:00:24,938 --> 00:00:26,132
Yes, Mr. Crolick.

13
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:28,366
Side to side to side.

14
00:00:28,475 --> 00:00:31,638
And not too much soap...
that's expensive.

15
00:00:34,915 --> 00:00:37,782
<i>My life does not suck.</i>

16
00:00:57,838 --> 00:01:00,636
<i>I've pictured this moment before.</i>

17
00:01:03,176 --> 00:01:06,236
<i>Over and over again.</i>

18
00:01:08,048 --> 00:01:09,572
<i>I saw it all very clear.</i>

19
00:01:13,353 --> 00:01:15,480
<i>Today is the last day of summer.</i>

20
00:01:16,256 --> 00:01:19,657
<i>I'll be committing some terrible acts.</i>

21
00:01:19,826 --> 00:01:24,160
<i>You'll most likely
hear about me on the news.</i>

22
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:27,892
<i>You'll talk about me
and hear my actions.</i>

23
00:01:28,268 --> 00:01:34,231
<i>Shocked, terrified, disgusted even.</i>

24
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:38,378
<i>But I won't feel sorry.
Not ever.</i>

25
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:42,676
<i>Today is the day that I strike back.</i>

26
00:01:44,677 --> 00:01:59,677

27
00:02:04,371 --> 00:02:05,360
Thaùs what I thought.

28
00:02:51,451 --> 00:02:52,941
Hello?

29
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,721
Hello? Excuse me.

30
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:00,783
Yup.

31
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,159
I'd like a room please.

32
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:18,002
Is that your rig out there
blocking the driveway?

33
00:03:18,178 --> 00:03:20,510
I didn't park. I don't drive.

34
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,272
You don't drive?

35
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:25,111
No, I don't drive.
I don't have a car, man.

36
00:03:25,218 --> 00:03:28,847
Anyway, uh, 34 is ready.
She's all cleaned out.

37
00:03:28,955 --> 00:03:32,516
Thaùll be $59.64,
and I need your driver's license.

38
00:04:07,527 --> 00:04:09,461
Shit!

39
00:04:10,864 --> 00:04:11,728
No, no, no, my friend.

40
00:04:12,432 --> 00:04:16,198
I'm telling you this is the best one
on the market for your money.

41
00:04:19,706 --> 00:04:20,673
I don't know.

42
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,603
Looks kind of used.
Is it used?

43
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:25,439
Oh no, my friend. I took it
out of the box this morning.

44
00:04:25,545 --> 00:04:27,206
That is why there's
some scratches on there.

45
00:04:27,314 --> 00:04:28,471
Let me...

46
00:04:28,782 --> 00:04:29,874
I can fix that for you.

47
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:30,880
I'm so careless.

48
00:04:30,984 --> 00:04:32,713
Perfect! Like never happened.

49
00:04:32,886 --> 00:04:37,255
And for you, I put in
a brand-new video memory card...

50
00:04:37,424 --> 00:04:38,892
for free.

51
00:04:39,493 --> 00:04:40,550
Free?

52
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,786
Free! Free, no charge.

53
00:04:41,895 --> 00:04:44,022
You can have it.
Just don't try to take it out.

54
00:04:44,197 --> 00:04:47,894
It... iùs a little bit stuck,
but it is not really a problem.

55
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:49,298
Stuck?
What do you mean, "stuck"?

56
00:04:49,402 --> 00:04:50,699
Stuck-stuck, it won't come out.

57
00:04:50,804 --> 00:04:52,465
But y-you don't need to take it out.

58
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,197
You stupid boy,
not too quick in the brain.

59
00:04:54,374 --> 00:04:57,007
You cannot take it out,
but you don't need to take it out.

60
00:04:57,177 --> 00:04:58,202
Iùs good to go.

61
00:04:58,311 --> 00:05:00,375
You want to make movie, you need
the video memory card inside.

62
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,310
You make a movie.

63
00:05:01,448 --> 00:05:04,110
Stop touching.
You want to buy, you buy.

64
00:05:04,284 --> 00:05:05,444
Asshole.

65
00:05:23,903 --> 00:05:25,302
Oh, yeah.

66
00:05:29,876 --> 00:05:31,935
One size fits all, my ass!

67
00:05:57,971 --> 00:06:00,166
Listen up, this is Joe.

68
00:06:00,273 --> 00:06:02,002
I'm a soldier of my destiny.

69
00:06:02,108 --> 00:06:03,666
I rule my destiny.

70
00:06:03,777 --> 00:06:06,245
And my destiny is...

71
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,841
I'm Joe.

72
00:06:12,952 --> 00:06:16,080
Listen up, you degenerates you.

73
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:20,455
This is Joe, and I'm the soldier
of my own destiny.

74
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,755
My destiny.

75
00:06:23,697 --> 00:06:26,928
And... and I'm tired of you
degenerates telling me what to do.

76
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:29,024
You... you degenerates.

77
00:06:29,536 --> 00:06:31,060
Today, I'm going to teach
the world a lesson.

78
00:06:31,171 --> 00:06:33,105
Today, I rule my own destiny.

79
00:06:33,206 --> 00:06:36,073
Today is the day
that Joe is going to show the world

80
00:06:36,176 --> 00:06:39,509
what he is capable of, with this.

81
00:06:40,413 --> 00:06:43,211
Fuck. Where's the...?

82
00:06:44,317 --> 00:06:45,045
Goddamn...

83
00:06:51,825 --> 00:06:54,794
On this historic day,
I will blow out your brain,

84
00:06:54,894 --> 00:06:59,194
and the blood
will wash away your sins.

85
00:07:07,707 --> 00:07:10,005
My life does not suck.

86
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,544
<i>How many more years
can I deny this?</i>

87
00:07:12,645 --> 00:07:14,135
<i>It does fucking suck.</i>

88
00:07:14,314 --> 00:07:18,375
<i>I am a failure. Thaùs what society
has labeled me to be.</i>

89
00:07:18,551 --> 00:07:19,882
<i>A meaningless nothing.</i>

90
00:07:19,986 --> 00:07:22,454
<i>A meaningless stain
smacked against the brick wall</i>

91
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:24,216
<i>we call society...</i>

92
00:07:24,324 --> 00:07:27,293
<i>similar to these mustard stains
on the ceiling.</i>

93
00:07:27,393 --> 00:07:28,951
<i>I think iùs mustard.</i>

94
00:07:29,062 --> 00:07:30,962
<i>Anyway, it wasn't always bad.</i>

95
00:07:31,064 --> 00:07:32,656
<i>Middle school was okay.</i>

96
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:37,066
<i>High school, thaùs when it got bad,
but I won't go into detaiI on that.</i>

97
00:07:37,704 --> 00:07:39,638
<i>I never really went back to school.</i>

98
00:07:39,739 --> 00:07:42,731
<i>Instead, I took matters
into my own hands.</i>

99
00:07:42,842 --> 00:07:46,209
<i>After a few years
of various odd jobs,</i>

100
00:07:46,312 --> 00:07:49,008
<i>I decided to get into business.</i>

101
00:07:53,186 --> 00:07:57,748
<i>The retaiI business was going sour
after a rapid market decline.</i>

102
00:07:57,924 --> 00:08:01,985
<i>Thaùs when I got into
my true passion... entertainment.</i>

103
00:08:02,128 --> 00:08:04,653
<i>I struck up a partnership
with my first rapper</i>

104
00:08:04,764 --> 00:08:07,858
<i>and got him on the right track
towards a record deal.</i>

105
00:08:08,034 --> 00:08:10,127
<i>Thaùs Timmy, the rapper.</i>

106
00:08:10,303 --> 00:08:12,999
<i>? Yeeeaaah?</i>

107
00:08:13,173 --> 00:08:18,978
<i>? Back on a block
like a flock of birds?</i>

108
00:08:19,712 --> 00:08:22,010
<i>? Ohhh?</i>

109
00:08:22,115 --> 00:08:28,020
<i>? In the Ferrari,
gettin' away from the popos?</i>

110
00:08:28,621 --> 00:08:32,318
<i>? Thaùs how I roll?</i>

111
00:08:32,492 --> 00:08:37,896
<i>? Switchin' the speeds,
I change the lanes?</i>

112
00:08:38,064 --> 00:08:44,029
<i>? Faster than the buses
and the airplanes?</i>

113
00:08:45,238 --> 00:08:48,230
Yes, I killed that one.

114
00:08:49,008 --> 00:08:51,272
Yeah. Word, my dawg.

115
00:08:51,377 --> 00:08:54,744
Uh, hey, listen.
Uh, can we do it again?

116
00:08:54,848 --> 00:08:58,113
Just maybe this time
just a little faster, al right?

117
00:08:58,284 --> 00:08:59,945
Uh, yeah, word, yeah.

118
00:09:00,053 --> 00:09:03,819
I just wanted that shit
to sound real clear.

119
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,719
Oh, yeah, it was...
it was clear, dawg.

120
00:09:05,825 --> 00:09:08,191
Um, but let me just check
with my sound engineer.

121
00:09:08,728 --> 00:09:11,492
Hey, engineer, was that clear?

122
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:13,760
Yo, Joey!

123
00:09:13,933 --> 00:09:15,423
Joey, was that clear?

124
00:09:15,602 --> 00:09:17,866
Uh, yeah, thaùs clear, yeah.

125
00:09:20,573 --> 00:09:22,507
Hey, yeah, um, so it was clear.

126
00:09:22,609 --> 00:09:23,906
So leùs take it one more time,

127
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,001
but this time, like I said,
leùs just do it a little faster.

128
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:29,376
I'm gonna make my peeps proud.

129
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:32,110
Okay. Um, good.

130
00:09:32,218 --> 00:09:33,651
Uh, engineer, go!

131
00:09:35,154 --> 00:09:36,746
Artist, go!

132
00:09:36,923 --> 00:09:39,483
<i>? I'm gonna murder this track,
motherfucker!?</i>

133
00:09:53,873 --> 00:09:58,333
I murdered that motherfucker beat.
I told you, man.

134
00:10:06,986 --> 00:10:08,419
<i>The entertainment business</i>

135
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:09,920
<i>didn't welcome me with open arms,</i>

136
00:10:10,023 --> 00:10:12,548
<i>so I had to get
into the food industry...</i>

137
00:10:12,725 --> 00:10:15,023
<i>the bottom of the food chain,
so to speak.</i>

138
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,565
Gregory!

139
00:10:24,737 --> 00:10:27,865
Gregory, how many times
do I have to tell you

140
00:10:27,974 --> 00:10:29,703
when the toilet
is plugged up like that,

141
00:10:29,876 --> 00:10:32,276
you have to get in there
and clean it thoroughly?

142
00:10:32,445 --> 00:10:33,469
Do you read me?

143
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:37,515
You have to get in there
and clean out all the feces.

144
00:10:37,617 --> 00:10:41,383
Every little bit of it... every kernel
of corn thaùs stuck to the rim.

145
00:10:41,487 --> 00:10:43,853
Get the feces!

146
00:10:43,957 --> 00:10:45,015
Yes, Mr. Crolick.

147
00:10:45,124 --> 00:10:49,185
Don't Mr. Crolick me.
Get the feces!

148
00:10:58,838 --> 00:11:00,328
<i>And it all went downhill from there.</i>

149
00:11:09,515 --> 00:11:14,680
If you ever finish with that,
I need you to start on the ceilings.

150
00:11:15,455 --> 00:11:18,185
I'm supposed to clean the ceilings?

151
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,191
I'm pretty sure I just said that.

152
00:11:20,293 --> 00:11:22,318
Of course you're supposed
to clean the ceilings.

153
00:11:22,428 --> 00:11:25,591
Look at them. They're filthy.

154
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:30,892
You are not the sharpest tool
on the workbench, are you, lad?

155
00:12:07,006 --> 00:12:08,633
Whaùs going on in here, lad?

156
00:12:09,042 --> 00:12:11,567
Uh, just a little clog, Mr. Crolick.
I'm on it.

157
00:12:11,677 --> 00:12:15,443
Oh, clog? Well, come on,
we haven't got all month here.

158
00:12:16,849 --> 00:12:19,750
Dig deeper.
Get some strength into it.

159
00:12:20,386 --> 00:12:22,513
I'm trying, sir. There seems to be
something in there.

160
00:12:22,622 --> 00:12:24,317
Oh, get... use your shoulder.
Come on.

161
00:12:24,424 --> 00:12:26,051
Come on, get down in there.

162
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,626
Use your shoulder.
Get it all in there.

163
00:12:27,727 --> 00:12:30,389
Thaùs it! There you go!

164
00:12:30,496 --> 00:12:32,657
Thaùs how you clear a toilet.

165
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,432
<i>That wasn't the end of it.</i>

166
00:12:42,775 --> 00:12:44,868
<i>One day Crolick did something
I'll never forget.</i>

167
00:12:45,044 --> 00:12:48,070
Lad! Hey, lad!

168
00:12:48,181 --> 00:12:49,478
Yes, Mr. Crolick?

169
00:12:49,582 --> 00:12:53,985
Ah, everybody!
Everybody listen up!

170
00:12:54,087 --> 00:12:58,524
I understand that today
is your birthday.

171
00:12:59,158 --> 00:13:00,523
Yes, sir, it is.

172
00:13:00,693 --> 00:13:03,560
Well, I got something for you.

173
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:08,490
Tada!

174
00:13:09,435 --> 00:13:10,993
Go on, go on, open it.

175
00:13:22,682 --> 00:13:24,479
Now you got a chance
to work your way up

176
00:13:24,584 --> 00:13:27,018
to the Employee of the Month Board,
aye?

177
00:13:32,425 --> 00:13:36,156
Well, go get the feces!

178
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,801
I think he really liked it.

179
00:13:42,902 --> 00:13:46,065
I hope so. I can't take it back
once he's used it.

180
00:13:46,172 --> 00:13:49,471
<i>That was it.
I had to do something.</i>

181
00:13:49,642 --> 00:13:53,578
<i>After 20 minutes on the internet,
I located a couple of guys.</i>

182
00:13:54,213 --> 00:13:55,942
<i>They were supposed to be
the real deal.</i>

183
00:14:08,327 --> 00:14:10,420
I am Black Harry.

184
00:14:11,197 --> 00:14:12,664
That is Yuri.

185
00:14:13,132 --> 00:14:13,894
Yuli?

186
00:14:14,066 --> 00:14:15,897
Yuri!

187
00:14:17,303 --> 00:14:18,565
Hi, Yuri.

188
00:14:20,072 --> 00:14:21,562
Are you Antonio?

189
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,434
Are you a police officer?

190
00:14:25,611 --> 00:14:26,908
No.

191
00:14:28,548 --> 00:14:30,448
Lift your top.

192
00:14:31,117 --> 00:14:31,845
What?

193
00:14:32,018 --> 00:14:33,542
Lift your top now!

194
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,958
Now drop your bottom.

195
00:14:42,128 --> 00:14:42,992
What?

196
00:14:43,162 --> 00:14:44,789
Bottoms down!

197
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,707
Okay. Okay.

198
00:15:14,694 --> 00:15:18,596
Desert Eagle Magnum from Israel.

199
00:15:21,901 --> 00:15:23,835
Is that an Uzi?

200
00:15:24,003 --> 00:15:26,767
Fully auto, 9P.

201
00:15:31,544 --> 00:15:33,171
Do you want to see
something bigger?

202
00:15:34,046 --> 00:15:35,673
Yes.

203
00:15:45,024 --> 00:15:49,586
All right, I'll take those four
and the machine gun.

204
00:15:50,396 --> 00:15:52,193
Do you want the bullets?

205
00:15:52,732 --> 00:15:54,529
The bullets don't come with it?

206
00:15:56,869 --> 00:15:58,427
Well, how much are they?

207
00:15:58,604 --> 00:16:00,538
How much do you have?

208
00:16:00,706 --> 00:16:03,038
$137.

209
00:16:04,944 --> 00:16:07,538
And 90 cents.

210
00:16:13,352 --> 00:16:14,944
You can have the junior.

211
00:16:18,357 --> 00:16:20,052
A junior...

212
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,559
...for a junior.

213
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:30,793
All right, I'll take it.

214
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:33,302
But I want the bullets.

215
00:16:34,106 --> 00:16:36,597
<i>After a long discussion with myself,</i>

216
00:16:36,776 --> 00:16:38,368
<i>my mind was set.</i>

217
00:16:38,544 --> 00:16:41,411
<i>It was time to strike back.</i>

218
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,276
<i>I just couldn't let them
get away with it anymore.</i>

219
00:16:44,717 --> 00:16:46,651
<i>No more laughing.</i>

220
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,651
<i>No more pushing me around.</i>

221
00:16:49,822 --> 00:16:52,052
<i>No more of this.</i>

222
00:16:52,224 --> 00:16:53,589
<i>This is my time.</i>

223
00:16:54,126 --> 00:16:56,458
<i>My time to show them.</i>

224
00:16:57,063 --> 00:16:58,997
<i>Fuck them all!</i>

225
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:02,261
<i>All of them.</i>

226
00:17:03,302 --> 00:17:05,293
<i>I don't care. Fuck 'em!</i>

227
00:17:06,238 --> 00:17:07,967
Happy birthday, kid!

228
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:20,416
Today is the day
I strike back.

229
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:23,920
Today is the day
that I make my mark.

230
00:17:24,023 --> 00:17:29,893
Today is the day that you're all
gonna stop and ask, "Why"?

231
00:17:40,439 --> 00:17:42,339
Yeah, Joey, iùs me.

232
00:17:42,441 --> 00:17:46,844
Look, um, I need a quick favor,
all right?

233
00:17:46,946 --> 00:17:50,211
No, Joey, I'm not at the arcade.

234
00:17:50,316 --> 00:17:53,808
I need you to focus for just...
for just two seconds, okay?

235
00:17:53,986 --> 00:17:56,716
Now, listen, I need you to get me
the mailing address

236
00:17:56,822 --> 00:17:58,847
to CNN News, you got that?

237
00:17:59,024 --> 00:18:01,515
CNN News.

238
00:18:02,261 --> 00:18:03,922
Because I need it.

239
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:06,156
Because I do.

240
00:18:07,066 --> 00:18:10,729
Look, Joey. Just get your ass
on the internet,

241
00:18:10,836 --> 00:18:14,033
type in CNN, and call me back.

242
00:19:02,655 --> 00:19:04,623
Hello?

243
00:19:04,723 --> 00:19:06,054
All right, hold on.

244
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,733
And thaùs CNN?

245
00:19:16,602 --> 00:19:18,900
Damn, what took you so long?

246
00:19:19,772 --> 00:19:22,570
All right, fine, whatever. Thanks.

247
00:19:23,142 --> 00:19:25,133
No, not today.

248
00:19:25,244 --> 00:19:27,269
Because.

249
00:19:27,446 --> 00:19:29,641
Just listen, Joey.

250
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:35,615
I may not be seeing you for a while
or something like that, and um...

251
00:19:35,721 --> 00:19:37,484
And... and I just want you to know

252
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:41,754
that you've always
been there for me, and...

253
00:19:42,194 --> 00:19:43,661
No!

254
00:19:43,762 --> 00:19:45,127
No!

255
00:19:45,297 --> 00:19:46,992
What... what part of "no"
makes you think

256
00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:48,930
I wanna fuckin' go to Fun City
with you?

257
00:19:49,034 --> 00:19:52,094
I'm never going to Fun City
with you ever a-fuckin'- gain!

258
00:19:52,238 --> 00:19:55,071
You fuckin' retarded retard!

259
00:21:35,107 --> 00:21:35,971
Hi.

260
00:21:36,075 --> 00:21:36,837
Hello.

261
00:21:37,009 --> 00:21:38,442
I'd like to send this.

262
00:21:42,147 --> 00:21:45,310
You filled out
the wrong form there.

263
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:47,578
This is for international shipments.

264
00:21:47,753 --> 00:21:50,051
Get one of those blue forms.

265
00:21:50,155 --> 00:21:52,419
Actually, we are out
of those blue forms.

266
00:21:52,524 --> 00:21:54,048
I'm gonna get you one.

267
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,617
Fill out this blue form here
and bring it back to me in a second.

268
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:00,323
Yeah, um, okay.

269
00:22:00,432 --> 00:22:02,992
Um, I'm in kind of a hurry,
so I you can just take this,

270
00:22:03,102 --> 00:22:06,435
and... and, uh, bend the rules
this one time, I'd appreciate it.

271
00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:07,936
No can do, sorry.

272
00:22:08,107 --> 00:22:09,301
Just fill out that form.

273
00:22:09,475 --> 00:22:12,239
Uh, iùll only take a minute.
Bring it back to me.

274
00:22:13,912 --> 00:22:15,140
Okie-dokie?

275
00:22:18,651 --> 00:22:20,141
Fucking coward.

276
00:22:22,321 --> 00:22:23,720
Pardon?

277
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:27,456
I'm sorry, what?

278
00:22:27,626 --> 00:22:31,323
- Did you just call me a coward?
- Huh?

279
00:22:31,497 --> 00:22:34,489
A fucking coward?
Did you just do that?

280
00:22:35,634 --> 00:22:36,726
Answer me, little man!

281
00:22:36,902 --> 00:22:39,268
Did you just get the nerve
to call me a fucking coward?

282
00:22:39,438 --> 00:22:42,305
Huh, you little penciI stick!
You little titty-licker!

283
00:22:42,408 --> 00:22:45,172
Uh, can you give me the location
of a shipment service

284
00:22:45,277 --> 00:22:47,973
within a 5-mile radius please?

285
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,445
You don't have one closer?

286
00:24:12,898 --> 00:24:17,198
Coleslaw, Coke, 21.

287
00:24:29,581 --> 00:24:30,513
Gregory!

288
00:24:31,183 --> 00:24:33,083
What are you doing here?
I thought I fired you.

289
00:24:33,252 --> 00:24:34,913
My favorite turd wrangler.

290
00:24:37,422 --> 00:24:39,617
Here, I figured out
what sign you are...

291
00:24:39,725 --> 00:24:42,057
Sagittarius with feces rising.

292
00:25:20,065 --> 00:25:21,259
Did you want something?

293
00:25:24,169 --> 00:25:26,831
He's on drugs or something.

294
00:25:28,106 --> 00:25:30,574
Probably forgot his plunger.

295
00:25:43,922 --> 00:25:48,086
You fuckin' pussy!
You fuckin' pussy coward!

296
00:25:52,297 --> 00:25:54,857
Come on, come on.

297
00:25:54,967 --> 00:25:57,959
Just pull the trigger.
Just pull it.

298
00:25:58,937 --> 00:26:01,201
Look what they've done to you.

299
00:26:01,306 --> 00:26:03,706
Just go out there and make it right.
Just pull the trigger.

300
00:26:03,809 --> 00:26:06,209
Come on! Come on!

301
00:26:08,981 --> 00:26:12,439
You're gonna do this.
You're gonna make it right.

302
00:26:14,353 --> 00:26:15,718
Come on.

303
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:20,620
Where are my buns?

304
00:26:20,726 --> 00:26:23,524
I want soft buns,
and I want them today.

305
00:26:23,695 --> 00:26:25,595
No, I called you two weeks ago,

306
00:26:25,697 --> 00:26:28,097
and the ones that you sent
were hard as rock.

307
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,599
I don't like hard buns.

308
00:26:29,701 --> 00:26:34,161
I like soft buns,
and I need them now, all right?

309
00:26:34,339 --> 00:26:36,068
No, I am not getting excited.

310
00:26:37,175 --> 00:26:42,408
Now. Not tomorrow,
not next week, now. Thank you.

311
00:26:44,716 --> 00:26:46,377
<i>Did she just look at me?</i>

312
00:27:01,166 --> 00:27:04,363
Excuse me? Miss!

313
00:27:08,373 --> 00:27:11,137
Miss, excuse me!

314
00:27:11,243 --> 00:27:12,533
Hello?

315
00:27:12,644 --> 00:27:13,603
Hi.

316
00:27:13,712 --> 00:27:16,046
Hi. I'm not interested.

317
00:27:16,848 --> 00:27:19,248
What do you mean
you're not interested?

318
00:27:19,351 --> 00:27:21,080
Um, I just wanted...

319
00:27:21,186 --> 00:27:22,653
I'm not interested.

320
00:27:22,754 --> 00:27:25,086
Oh, hey, listen, I just...

321
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:27,351
I'm sorry.

322
00:27:27,459 --> 00:27:30,724
I know this is weird,
but I saw you in there,

323
00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:32,763
and you were looking at me,
and I looked at you,

324
00:27:32,864 --> 00:27:35,128
so I just thought I would
just come out and say hello.

325
00:27:35,233 --> 00:27:37,963
Can I help you?
Do you need something?

326
00:27:39,104 --> 00:27:40,537
Why, do you have a boyfriend
or something?

327
00:27:40,639 --> 00:27:42,732
Is that why you don't want
to talk to me?

328
00:27:46,845 --> 00:27:49,780
Listen, hey,
iùs just like, you know...

329
00:27:51,216 --> 00:27:52,240
Thaùs kind of rude.

330
00:27:52,351 --> 00:27:53,613
Yeah, I am so happy
you called just now

331
00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:57,052
because the skinniest,
tallest little man

332
00:27:57,155 --> 00:27:58,622
is standing by me
and trying to talk to me.

333
00:27:58,724 --> 00:27:59,884
I think he's trying to ask me out.

334
00:27:59,992 --> 00:28:01,118
Thaùs not nice.

335
00:28:02,761 --> 00:28:04,160
Thaùs not nice.
You're being rude.

336
00:28:04,262 --> 00:28:05,524
I'm just... all I wanted to do is...

337
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,621
All right, thaùs enough now, okay?

338
00:28:07,733 --> 00:28:09,667
I'm just trying to be nice to you.

339
00:28:09,768 --> 00:28:12,134
You don't let people be nice to you.
I don't...

340
00:28:12,237 --> 00:28:13,397
- You know what?
- All right.

341
00:28:13,505 --> 00:28:14,631
No, listen.
You listen to me now.

342
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,139
Look at all these people
looking at you.

343
00:28:16,241 --> 00:28:17,674
- Nobody can see me.
- Listen to me.

344
00:28:17,776 --> 00:28:20,677
Listen... listen... listen to me.
Listen to me, listen to me.

345
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:23,077
All right. All I wanted was
to talk to you for two seconds,

346
00:28:23,181 --> 00:28:25,046
and you can't even let me
talk to you for two seconds,

347
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,947
but you're going to
because I have this,

348
00:28:27,052 --> 00:28:28,610
and we're gonna walk.

349
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,711
And if you try
to get away from me...

350
00:28:30,822 --> 00:28:32,517
Okay, leùs walk.

351
00:28:32,624 --> 00:28:34,421
Look at all these people
looking at you right now.

352
00:28:34,526 --> 00:28:36,323
Hi.

353
00:28:36,862 --> 00:28:39,558
Oh, you're right.
I'm doing this wrong.

354
00:28:39,664 --> 00:28:41,029
Now.

355
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:43,628
We're walking
towards the restaurant.

356
00:28:43,735 --> 00:28:46,260
Look how natural we look together.
We look good together.

357
00:28:46,371 --> 00:28:47,668
We're gonna walk
past the restaurant,

358
00:28:47,773 --> 00:28:49,934
and we're gonna talk for just
two minutes... just two minutes.

359
00:28:50,042 --> 00:28:52,408
You can't talk to me for two minutes,
whaùs wrong with you?

360
00:28:52,511 --> 00:28:53,842
How drunk are you?

361
00:28:57,282 --> 00:28:58,249
Aah!

362
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,341
You just shut up, bitch.
You just shut up.

363
00:29:00,452 --> 00:29:02,852
Don't you scream, or I'll shoot out
both your fucking eyeballs.

364
00:29:02,954 --> 00:29:04,148
Okay, okay.

365
00:29:56,007 --> 00:29:57,440
Goddamn it!

366
00:29:58,376 --> 00:30:00,936
Just tell me.
Just fucking tell me.

367
00:30:01,046 --> 00:30:03,037
Did you or did you not
give me a sign?

368
00:30:03,148 --> 00:30:05,116
You did, right?
You gave me a sign!

369
00:30:07,686 --> 00:30:09,620
Oh, you didn't! I knew you didn't!

370
00:30:09,721 --> 00:30:11,313
Oh, I'm just a fucking idiot.

371
00:30:11,423 --> 00:30:13,516
I always get this shit wrong
when it comes to girls.

372
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:14,649
I always fucking get...

373
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:18,126
Don't you move, bitch!
Don't you move!

374
00:30:19,164 --> 00:30:20,461
See, I'm trying to be nice to you,

375
00:30:20,632 --> 00:30:23,294
and you fuckin' wanna run away
and tell on me?

376
00:30:24,436 --> 00:30:27,428
I had a fucking plan.
You fucked this up for me.

377
00:30:27,572 --> 00:30:29,506
You're a fuckin' seducer,
thaùs what you are!

378
00:30:29,608 --> 00:30:30,370
This is your fault!

379
00:30:30,475 --> 00:30:33,911
I was just eating my fuckin' lunch,
and you looked at me first!

380
00:30:34,012 --> 00:30:36,537
I didn't look at you!

381
00:30:39,417 --> 00:30:42,443
Fuck! The fucking cops!
Did you call them?

382
00:30:42,554 --> 00:30:43,646
I didn't call the cops.

383
00:30:43,755 --> 00:30:46,690
You're right. You could...
you could not have called the cops.

384
00:30:46,791 --> 00:30:49,419
Somebody called the cops, though,
didn't they?

385
00:30:49,594 --> 00:30:51,494
This is what we're gonna do.

386
00:30:51,596 --> 00:30:54,656
We're gonna walk. Iùs not very far.
We're gonna walk out of here.

387
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:56,391
Yes, we are.
We're gonna fuckin' walk,

388
00:30:56,501 --> 00:31:01,336
and if you move or if you scream,
I'm gonna shoot you in the face.

389
00:31:02,274 --> 00:31:03,707
Okay, leùs go.

390
00:31:03,808 --> 00:31:07,574
I don't fucking give a shit
about shit.

391
00:31:11,149 --> 00:31:14,380
- Where are we going?
- Don't talk, or I'll shoot you.

392
00:31:15,687 --> 00:31:17,552
Eyes forward.

393
00:31:18,557 --> 00:31:22,721
Don't make this hard on me.
I'm having a very bad day.

394
00:31:25,263 --> 00:31:27,390
Sir, please just let me go.

395
00:31:27,499 --> 00:31:29,990
I swear to God I'm not gonna tell
anybody anything about you.

396
00:31:30,101 --> 00:31:30,999
I don't even know you.

397
00:31:31,102 --> 00:31:33,036
Do I look like an idiot to you?

398
00:31:42,214 --> 00:31:45,809
Stop looking so nervous.
You're so damn obvious.

399
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:57,123
Don't you move, or I'll shoot you.

400
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:02,457
The key doesn't work

401
00:32:05,904 --> 00:32:08,464
Stop! Come back here!

402
00:32:14,045 --> 00:32:16,240
You stabbed me, bitch!

403
00:32:16,414 --> 00:32:18,814
Come on. Come here.

404
00:32:19,951 --> 00:32:21,851
Don't make me shoot you, lady.

405
00:32:21,953 --> 00:32:23,352
Please!

406
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,890
I'm sorry.

407
00:32:28,093 --> 00:32:30,527
Okay. So walk.

408
00:32:30,629 --> 00:32:32,893
And don't you fucking try to move.

409
00:32:32,998 --> 00:32:34,431
Okay.

410
00:32:44,476 --> 00:32:46,637
- Please let me go.
- I can't let you go.

411
00:32:46,745 --> 00:32:50,442
- Just let me go.
- I can't. You'll tell on me.

412
00:32:53,952 --> 00:32:55,544
No!

413
00:33:00,158 --> 00:33:03,321
So you think this is the guy...
Gregory?

414
00:33:03,428 --> 00:33:05,726
Well, I'm not actually saying that.

415
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:10,267
I'm actually implying
that it could be him.

416
00:33:10,368 --> 00:33:13,804
I mean, those could be
his bullets there.

417
00:33:13,905 --> 00:33:16,430
So you think that it might be him?

418
00:33:16,608 --> 00:33:19,372
Right, yeah. Well, I...
thaùs what I'm implying.

419
00:33:19,477 --> 00:33:22,913
I'm just... I'm not really saying it.
You know.

420
00:33:23,081 --> 00:33:27,677
So, you're making an implication
but you're not actually saying it?

421
00:33:29,721 --> 00:33:30,983
Yeah, yeah.

422
00:33:31,156 --> 00:33:32,885
Well, you know
we can't make an arrest

423
00:33:33,058 --> 00:33:35,219
solely on your implications, right?

424
00:33:59,718 --> 00:34:03,176
Oh, man. I fuckin' blew it.

425
00:34:07,325 --> 00:34:08,792
This is great.

426
00:34:18,002 --> 00:34:19,094
Fuck.

427
00:34:20,972 --> 00:34:22,371
Fuck!

428
00:34:25,777 --> 00:34:27,210
Just when everything
was gonna happen,

429
00:34:27,312 --> 00:34:29,678
I fuckin' blew it. I blew it.

430
00:34:30,648 --> 00:34:31,945
Now a fuckin' hostage.

431
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:35,611
What the fuck am I gonna do
with a hostage?

432
00:34:38,189 --> 00:34:42,285
Goddamn it.
What a fuckin' mess.

433
00:34:46,464 --> 00:34:47,988
Fuck.

434
00:34:49,467 --> 00:34:51,230
Do you think
this is gonna get infected?

435
00:35:03,214 --> 00:35:04,647
Hello?

436
00:35:04,816 --> 00:35:06,511
Time's up!

437
00:35:07,085 --> 00:35:07,881
What?

438
00:35:07,986 --> 00:35:11,046
Half a day is gone.
Pay up or be gone.

439
00:35:11,156 --> 00:35:13,556
Oh, shit!
I only paid for half a day?

440
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,923
Oh, shit.

441
00:35:22,033 --> 00:35:26,265
Hey, can I borrow 30 bucks?

442
00:35:32,243 --> 00:35:33,972
Come on. Are you comin'?

443
00:35:34,078 --> 00:35:35,511
Fuck.

444
00:35:37,415 --> 00:35:39,849
Jesus Christ! How long are you
gonna make me stand out here?

445
00:35:50,595 --> 00:35:55,726
Listen. I'm gonna go pay this man,
and if you scream...

446
00:36:05,743 --> 00:36:07,677
Look, you got to pay
if you want to stay.

447
00:36:07,779 --> 00:36:09,041
Thaùs the way that it works.

448
00:36:09,147 --> 00:36:11,081
I don't make the rules.
I just got to pay the bills.

449
00:36:11,249 --> 00:36:13,308
The only way I can pay the bills
is if you give me money.

450
00:36:13,418 --> 00:36:16,751
So if you're staying, give me money.
If you're going, get the hell out.

451
00:36:16,921 --> 00:36:20,186
So is there anything else
that you could tell us about him?

452
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:22,122
What was his position?

453
00:36:22,594 --> 00:36:23,925
He was a...

454
00:36:24,095 --> 00:36:26,086
You got to get one more out!

455
00:36:26,264 --> 00:36:27,731
Part-time custodian.

456
00:36:27,899 --> 00:36:29,764
And you fired him because...?

457
00:36:29,868 --> 00:36:33,736
I fired him
because he couldn't do the toilets.

458
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:35,772
- The toilet?
- The toilets.

459
00:36:35,874 --> 00:36:38,206
He truly didn't care
about his position.

460
00:36:38,309 --> 00:36:40,607
I didn't have a choice in the matter.

461
00:36:40,778 --> 00:36:43,269
So you let him go because
he couldn't clean the toilets?

462
00:36:43,448 --> 00:36:44,506
Yes.

463
00:36:56,661 --> 00:36:57,992
Thanks.

464
00:36:58,162 --> 00:37:01,154
I'll pay you back, I promise.

465
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,827
This really isn't like me.

466
00:37:03,935 --> 00:37:08,634
All this stuff...
especially with money.

467
00:37:10,108 --> 00:37:13,635
I promise I will pay you back.
I don't like to borrow.

468
00:37:13,745 --> 00:37:16,839
So please, what are you gonna do?

469
00:37:21,486 --> 00:37:23,511
Listen, you know,
if you wanna rob the place,

470
00:37:23,621 --> 00:37:25,555
I really don't care...
I swear to God.

471
00:37:27,959 --> 00:37:29,051
You mean the restaurant?

472
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,425
Yeah, I swear to God,
I won't tell anyone.

473
00:37:36,868 --> 00:37:37,698
Shit.

474
00:37:47,845 --> 00:37:49,608
Why couldn't you just say hi to me?

475
00:37:49,714 --> 00:37:52,615
Whaùs so hard
about saying hi to somebody?

476
00:37:52,717 --> 00:37:55,083
I don't talk to strangers.
I'm sorry.

477
00:37:56,721 --> 00:37:58,882
Well, I'm Joe.

478
00:38:01,926 --> 00:38:03,325
And you are?

479
00:38:04,362 --> 00:38:06,353
Linda.

480
00:38:06,531 --> 00:38:08,231
Linda, what is that,
like a nickname or something?

481
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,266
What?

482
00:38:09,367 --> 00:38:11,897
Yeah. On your license,
when I was paying that guy,

483
00:38:12,003 --> 00:38:14,836
I saw in your license
it said Stephanie.

484
00:38:15,006 --> 00:38:15,973
So, which one do you prefer?

485
00:38:16,074 --> 00:38:18,042
Do you prefer Linda
or do you prefer Stephanie?

486
00:38:18,142 --> 00:38:19,336
Stephanie is fine.

487
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,807
So why do you have
a license anyway?

488
00:38:20,912 --> 00:38:22,539
I noticed you didn't have a car.

489
00:38:23,615 --> 00:38:26,379
Iùs in the shop.
Iùs being repainted.

490
00:38:30,488 --> 00:38:32,422
Yeah, mine, too.

491
00:38:32,857 --> 00:38:33,846
Sir.

492
00:38:35,393 --> 00:38:40,456
Joe, please just let me go, okay?

493
00:38:40,565 --> 00:38:42,965
I have a 5-year-old son at home,
and he's alone,

494
00:38:43,067 --> 00:38:45,126
and I have to go be with him.

495
00:38:45,303 --> 00:38:46,736
Please.

496
00:38:46,904 --> 00:38:48,531
You have a 5-year-old son?

497
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:52,103
Really?

498
00:38:56,114 --> 00:38:56,978
Whaùs his name?

499
00:38:57,715 --> 00:38:59,307
Brandon.

500
00:39:01,152 --> 00:39:02,642
Brandon.

501
00:39:07,892 --> 00:39:10,793
Why didn't you have any pictures
of him in your wallet?

502
00:39:11,329 --> 00:39:12,591
What do you mean?

503
00:39:12,764 --> 00:39:14,288
What the fuck do you take me for?

504
00:39:14,465 --> 00:39:16,626
Do you think I'm a fuckin' idiot?

505
00:39:35,086 --> 00:39:37,247
- So I guess we're done.
- Yeah.

506
00:39:37,422 --> 00:39:38,855
Wait a minute. Hold...

507
00:39:38,956 --> 00:39:40,583
Now, hang on, what about me?

508
00:39:40,692 --> 00:39:41,488
What about you?

509
00:39:41,659 --> 00:39:43,092
I could be in danger here.

510
00:39:43,194 --> 00:39:45,856
I mean, who knows
what this kid is capable of.

511
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,554
Kids these days? Come on.

512
00:39:47,665 --> 00:39:51,658
But we absolutely have no proof
that he dropped those bullets.

513
00:39:51,836 --> 00:39:53,235
No threat, no motive,

514
00:39:53,337 --> 00:39:58,036
so we can't officially charge anyone.

515
00:39:59,277 --> 00:40:00,608
What are you implying?

516
00:40:00,778 --> 00:40:02,943
- No, we're saying it.
- You know what?

517
00:40:03,047 --> 00:40:06,448
I think you should just relax
and just go on with your day.

518
00:40:06,617 --> 00:40:08,209
Try a little chamomile tea.

519
00:40:08,386 --> 00:40:12,083
Okay.

520
00:40:13,391 --> 00:40:15,382
<i>What am I doing?</i>

521
00:40:15,493 --> 00:40:17,085
<i>Should I just run?</i>

522
00:40:17,195 --> 00:40:20,460
<i>Yeah, I'm gonna just run.</i>

523
00:40:20,565 --> 00:40:22,089
<i>What about her?</i>

524
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,930
<i>Who is she gonna tell?</i>

525
00:40:25,603 --> 00:40:27,070
<i>Yeah, she'll tell.</i>

526
00:40:59,003 --> 00:41:01,733
<i>Oh, pussy.</i>

527
00:41:40,745 --> 00:41:43,111
No!

528
00:41:59,297 --> 00:42:00,787
Miss?

529
00:42:01,265 --> 00:42:03,790
Oh. Oh, shit.

530
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:21,213
<i>I've never hit a girl before.</i>

531
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:23,310
<i>Never really hit a dude either.</i>

532
00:42:23,421 --> 00:42:27,323
<i>Now I hit a girl before a guy. Fuck.</i>

533
00:42:27,425 --> 00:42:31,088
<i>Not a good way to start a relation...
or friendship.</i>

534
00:42:31,195 --> 00:42:32,924
<i>No. I don't know.</i>

535
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:36,329
<i>What the hell do I call it?
An interaction?</i>

536
00:43:12,303 --> 00:43:14,794
I brought you a snack.

537
00:43:27,752 --> 00:43:29,014
What? No appetite?

538
00:43:31,055 --> 00:43:32,215
Okay.

539
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,329
Excuse me.

540
00:44:48,099 --> 00:44:49,532
- Mr. Crolick.
- Gosh!

541
00:44:50,101 --> 00:44:52,228
Jason. Come on, kid.

542
00:44:52,336 --> 00:44:54,566
Come here, come here, come here.
Over here, over here.

543
00:44:54,672 --> 00:44:56,537
- The bathrooms are cleaned, sir.
- Are they?

544
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,834
- Yeah.
- Good.

545
00:44:58,009 --> 00:45:00,500
You... you sure looked
like you're doing a good job.

546
00:45:00,678 --> 00:45:02,009
Oh, well.

547
00:45:02,113 --> 00:45:04,513
Listen. Hey, Jason, you seen...?

548
00:45:04,615 --> 00:45:07,482
Have you seen anything suspicious
going on around here?

549
00:45:07,585 --> 00:45:11,715
Well, in one of the toilets
I saw an unusually large...

550
00:45:11,822 --> 00:45:13,756
No, no, not that, not that.

551
00:45:13,858 --> 00:45:16,725
I mean, around here.

552
00:45:17,995 --> 00:45:19,519
- Here?
- Yeah.

553
00:45:23,234 --> 00:45:25,702
Never mind. Never mind.

554
00:45:25,803 --> 00:45:28,533
Listen, you are a fine boy.

555
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:29,901
You really are.

556
00:45:30,007 --> 00:45:31,668
I'm proud of you, lad.

557
00:45:31,842 --> 00:45:33,275
- You keep up the good work.
- Okay, sir.

558
00:45:33,377 --> 00:45:34,173
- All right?
- Yeah.

559
00:45:34,278 --> 00:45:35,973
- Take care.
- Okay. All right.

560
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,275
Atatat, go this way, this way.

561
00:45:38,382 --> 00:45:39,872
- Right.
- Okay.

562
00:45:39,984 --> 00:45:41,611
Right you are.

563
00:45:42,686 --> 00:45:44,984
Oh, Jesus.

564
00:46:01,405 --> 00:46:02,929
Sorry.

565
00:46:07,244 --> 00:46:09,838
Oh, you work at a hospital.

566
00:46:10,014 --> 00:46:12,346
What are you? A doctor?

567
00:46:20,658 --> 00:46:24,253
Listen, I'm really sorry
about hitting you.

568
00:46:24,428 --> 00:46:25,690
But what else
was I supposed to do?

569
00:46:25,796 --> 00:46:27,730
I mean, you're coming at me
with a knife.

570
00:46:27,898 --> 00:46:30,230
Please take this off.

571
00:46:30,801 --> 00:46:31,597
What?

572
00:46:31,702 --> 00:46:33,897
Let me go.

573
00:47:01,132 --> 00:47:03,066
Are you gonna rape me?

574
00:47:05,102 --> 00:47:06,535
What?

575
00:47:07,138 --> 00:47:11,097
No. I'm not gonna rape you.
I'm not a sicko.

576
00:47:17,648 --> 00:47:20,412
Joe, I really don't care what you do.

577
00:47:21,252 --> 00:47:23,015
I really don't care
if you rob that place.

578
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,782
I promise I'm not gonna tell anyone.

579
00:47:26,657 --> 00:47:28,454
Joe, I give you my word, okay?

580
00:47:28,626 --> 00:47:31,618
I swear to God
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

581
00:47:31,729 --> 00:47:33,720
Honestly, I don't even know
what you look like.

582
00:47:33,831 --> 00:47:38,564
Yeah. I suppose I have one
of those unrememberable faces.

583
00:47:41,172 --> 00:47:43,265
Thaùs not what I meant.

584
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,204
People don't get me, you know.

585
00:47:48,679 --> 00:47:53,446
When I was 7 years old,
I thought that I would own the world,

586
00:47:53,551 --> 00:47:54,518
you know what I mean?

587
00:47:54,618 --> 00:47:56,142
I mean not really, not literally,

588
00:47:56,253 --> 00:48:00,189
but I really thought
I was on to something big.

589
00:48:01,125 --> 00:48:03,423
But I wasn't.

590
00:48:10,935 --> 00:48:13,529
Red Star Buffet.

591
00:48:14,805 --> 00:48:17,797
That sounds nice.
Is it fancy?

592
00:48:18,909 --> 00:48:24,781
Oh, looks like I'm not
the only criminal in the house.

593
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:41,329
Whip it up with miracle mix.

594
00:48:41,432 --> 00:48:42,865
I did.

595
00:48:43,701 --> 00:48:45,293
More miracle mix, please.

596
00:48:45,402 --> 00:48:47,029
Mr. Crolick, I already made
a whole batch.

597
00:48:47,204 --> 00:48:50,537
Don't "Mr. Crolick" me.
Just do as I say.

598
00:48:50,708 --> 00:48:53,541
More miracle mix.

599
00:48:53,711 --> 00:48:56,509
People, listen up.

600
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:00,776
My meat will not be taken for granted
in this kitchen.

601
00:49:00,884 --> 00:49:05,878
When we're dealing with my meat,
we always use an extender.

602
00:49:13,998 --> 00:49:17,399
This is good.
This is really good.

603
00:49:17,501 --> 00:49:20,026
I don't really smoke that much.

604
00:49:23,073 --> 00:49:24,472
Me neither.

605
00:49:24,575 --> 00:49:26,270
It calms me down.

606
00:49:27,978 --> 00:49:30,173
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

607
00:49:30,281 --> 00:49:32,715
Well, it easily makes me paranoid.

608
00:49:34,852 --> 00:49:36,251
Really?

609
00:49:36,353 --> 00:49:38,048
No, not really.

610
00:49:39,023 --> 00:49:43,687
But seriously,
can I ask you something?

611
00:49:45,696 --> 00:49:48,631
Why didn't you talk to me
when I approached you earlier?

612
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:52,200
You... you can tell me the truth.
I won't get mad, I promise.

613
00:49:52,303 --> 00:49:56,262
You know, honestly, it has
nothing to do with you. Iùs me.

614
00:49:56,440 --> 00:50:00,001
No, don't say that. Come on.

615
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:05,210
I don't know.
Maybe iùs your voice.

616
00:50:05,382 --> 00:50:06,644
My voice?

617
00:50:07,184 --> 00:50:10,085
The way you were talking.
It was kind of weird at first.

618
00:50:14,325 --> 00:50:16,122
I think I smelled something.

619
00:50:16,894 --> 00:50:17,918
Was it me?

620
00:50:20,164 --> 00:50:21,392
I don't smell anything.

621
00:50:21,498 --> 00:50:23,932
Can I ask you something?

622
00:50:24,601 --> 00:50:27,126
Why'd you decide to approach me?

623
00:50:27,237 --> 00:50:29,000
I told you,
I thought we had a moment,

624
00:50:29,106 --> 00:50:32,564
you know, the way
we looked at each other.

625
00:50:33,043 --> 00:50:35,739
I was just trying to be spontaneous.

626
00:50:35,913 --> 00:50:37,904
I'll never do that again.

627
00:50:47,157 --> 00:50:48,647
Do you hear that?

628
00:50:53,297 --> 00:50:54,764
Where is that coming from?

629
00:50:55,432 --> 00:50:57,195
From the tub, I think.

630
00:51:04,007 --> 00:51:05,133
You're gonna break it.

631
00:51:05,242 --> 00:51:08,109
I don't care. This isn't my house.

632
00:51:15,552 --> 00:51:16,951
Shit!

633
00:51:17,054 --> 00:51:18,214
Shit, thaùs big!

634
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:23,221
Ken, working hard, I see.

635
00:51:23,327 --> 00:51:25,261
Chopping onions.

636
00:51:25,362 --> 00:51:28,229
Chop, chop.

637
00:51:29,333 --> 00:51:31,494
Really slowly.

638
00:51:32,603 --> 00:51:35,629
Hey listen, Ken, have you, uh...

639
00:51:35,739 --> 00:51:39,402
have you seen anything
out of the ordinary here lately?

640
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:40,499
I don't know.

641
00:51:40,611 --> 00:51:45,344
No, I mean, anything
out of the normal, leùs say.

642
00:51:45,449 --> 00:51:46,916
I don't know.

643
00:51:47,017 --> 00:51:50,817
Have you seen Gregory today?

644
00:51:51,855 --> 00:51:56,258
Not today. I saw him yesterday,
but I didn't see him today.

645
00:51:56,927 --> 00:51:58,394
Right.

646
00:52:00,798 --> 00:52:02,698
You're happy working here,
aren't you?

647
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:06,328
I mean you're a happy worker, right?

648
00:52:06,437 --> 00:52:08,064
Iùs okay.

649
00:52:08,172 --> 00:52:11,300
Not disgruntled in the least?

650
00:52:12,042 --> 00:52:13,236
Yeah.

651
00:52:13,343 --> 00:52:15,368
I like... I like working here, too.

652
00:52:16,413 --> 00:52:21,180
Great job. Great, great job.
Good benefits.

653
00:52:28,392 --> 00:52:32,419
All right. Well, listen,
iùs been great rappin' with you,

654
00:52:32,529 --> 00:52:35,589
and, uh, you carry on, okay?

655
00:52:35,699 --> 00:52:38,668
Catch you on the flip-flop.

656
00:52:38,969 --> 00:52:41,199
I'm just one of the guys.

657
00:53:04,828 --> 00:53:07,797
Right. Carry on.

658
00:53:12,803 --> 00:53:15,465
<i>Say something cool.</i>

659
00:53:15,639 --> 00:53:17,504
<i>Come on.</i>

660
00:53:17,608 --> 00:53:19,405
<i>Nah, wait.</i>

661
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:21,410
<i>Just be natural.</i>

662
00:53:21,512 --> 00:53:22,843
<i>You don't have to think at all.</i>

663
00:53:22,946 --> 00:53:27,474
<i>Just don't try so hard.
Just be smooth.</i>

664
00:53:27,584 --> 00:53:32,351
<i>Oh, no. Let her talk.
She'll think of something.</i>

665
00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:34,357
<i>Nah.</i>

666
00:53:34,458 --> 00:53:36,926
<i>Think of something cool.</i>

667
00:53:37,327 --> 00:53:38,794
I...

668
00:53:40,197 --> 00:53:43,325
I always felt bad for the lobsters.

669
00:53:43,433 --> 00:53:47,631
You know the lobsters in those
big glass sinks in the supermarket?

670
00:53:48,338 --> 00:53:52,866
They're just in there
piled on top of each other.

671
00:53:52,976 --> 00:53:58,437
This one time, me and Joey,
my friend,

672
00:53:58,549 --> 00:54:01,450
we got obliterated,
and we went down there,

673
00:54:01,552 --> 00:54:03,349
and we were staring at them,

674
00:54:03,453 --> 00:54:09,255
and I kept thinking, "I wonder
what they're thinking," you know?

675
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:11,452
I mean, they're in there,

676
00:54:11,562 --> 00:54:13,427
and they can see us
through those glass walls,

677
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:16,931
and we must look
like giants to them.

678
00:54:18,068 --> 00:54:21,265
Then they're just there
and just hanging out,

679
00:54:21,371 --> 00:54:23,839
waiting for their turn
to go into the pot.

680
00:54:25,609 --> 00:54:27,304
What a life.

681
00:54:27,978 --> 00:54:29,343
Man.

682
00:54:30,547 --> 00:54:31,639
Hey, Joe.

683
00:54:32,616 --> 00:54:33,674
Yeah?

684
00:54:34,718 --> 00:54:36,879
What are you gonna do?

685
00:54:36,987 --> 00:54:39,114
I don't know.

686
00:54:44,695 --> 00:54:47,220
What are you gonna do with me?

687
00:54:49,499 --> 00:54:51,933
I don't know.

688
00:54:53,203 --> 00:54:55,501
We could talk.

689
00:54:55,606 --> 00:54:57,164
Do you wanna just talk?

690
00:55:04,781 --> 00:55:07,409
I'm so tired.

691
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:11,883
I'm just really, really tired.

692
00:55:13,323 --> 00:55:15,291
Of everything, you know.

693
00:55:17,828 --> 00:55:20,353
I'm just so tired.

694
00:55:29,206 --> 00:55:31,106
I wrote a book once.

695
00:55:31,208 --> 00:55:32,334
You did?

696
00:55:32,442 --> 00:55:33,500
Yeah.

697
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:35,100
Thaùs cool.
What was it about?

698
00:55:35,212 --> 00:55:37,476
Well, iùs a novel,

699
00:55:37,581 --> 00:55:40,607
and, um, the main character...
he, um... he has this dream

700
00:55:40,717 --> 00:55:45,620
of building the worlÔs
tallest building, this tower,

701
00:55:45,722 --> 00:55:47,781
only he has all this opposition.

702
00:55:47,958 --> 00:55:50,256
Everybody's trying
to mess up his plans,

703
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,851
and he doesn't know
who his enemies are.

704
00:55:52,963 --> 00:55:54,954
But he also doesn't know
who his friends are either

705
00:55:55,065 --> 00:55:59,832
because people keep
shifting identities, and...

706
00:56:02,205 --> 00:56:05,663
Well, it had some
sci-fi elements to it.

707
00:56:05,842 --> 00:56:07,469
Thaùs cool.

708
00:56:07,577 --> 00:56:09,101
Yeah.

709
00:56:09,279 --> 00:56:10,473
Whaùd you do with it?

710
00:56:11,114 --> 00:56:13,674
I sent it to a few publishers.

711
00:56:14,918 --> 00:56:17,148
What did they say?

712
00:56:17,487 --> 00:56:18,647
They sent me back letters.

713
00:56:18,755 --> 00:56:21,417
It said something like, um,
they couldn't read it

714
00:56:21,525 --> 00:56:25,484
because it was unsolicited material
or some shit like that,

715
00:56:25,595 --> 00:56:28,189
whatever the fuck
thaùs supposed to mean.

716
00:56:29,266 --> 00:56:32,758
Fucking cowards.
I hate fucking cowards.

717
00:56:32,936 --> 00:56:36,030
Like, Mr. Crolick, for instance.

718
00:56:36,139 --> 00:56:37,697
Who's that?

719
00:56:37,808 --> 00:56:40,538
He's my boss at that burger joint.

720
00:56:40,711 --> 00:56:43,271
Get the feces!

721
00:56:43,447 --> 00:56:48,111
Like, he made me stick my arms
up to my elbows in toilet bowls.

722
00:56:48,218 --> 00:56:50,049
He's fucking sick.

723
00:56:51,722 --> 00:56:53,383
Did you quit?

724
00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:54,718
Almost.

725
00:56:54,891 --> 00:56:57,621
On the day I decided to quit,
he fired me.

726
00:56:57,728 --> 00:57:00,959
Damn it, Gregory,
I've had it right up to here with you.

727
00:57:01,064 --> 00:57:02,190
Right up to here.

728
00:57:02,299 --> 00:57:04,130
You were the worst employee
I have ever had,

729
00:57:04,234 --> 00:57:05,428
and you're out of here.

730
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:06,627
You hear me? Gone.

731
00:57:06,803 --> 00:57:09,397
Ah, he's the king of assholes.

732
00:57:09,506 --> 00:57:12,634
This one time
he put up a picture of me

733
00:57:12,743 --> 00:57:14,938
right up next
to the Employee of the Month

734
00:57:15,045 --> 00:57:17,707
with a big sign underneath
that read,

735
00:57:17,814 --> 00:57:22,945
"Gregory Wilks,
a lazy, incompetent employee."'

736
00:57:23,587 --> 00:57:25,885
He wanted to make an example
out of me or something.

737
00:57:25,989 --> 00:57:29,516
Out of me, like, for what?
What did I ever do to him?

738
00:57:31,762 --> 00:57:34,390
Did you just say Gregory Wilks?

739
00:57:34,498 --> 00:57:37,990
Yeah. Gregory fucking Wilks.

740
00:57:38,101 --> 00:57:39,090
Joe's my nickname.

741
00:57:39,202 --> 00:57:41,067
Well, not really.
I just call myself that.

742
00:57:41,171 --> 00:57:42,661
I like how it sounds.

743
00:57:46,109 --> 00:57:48,202
Did you go to Stevenson High?

744
00:57:50,013 --> 00:57:53,039
I don't really like to talk
about high school.

745
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:54,879
I went to Stevenson High.

746
00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:59,948
<i>So, wait, are you, like,
the Gregory Wilks?</i>

747
00:58:00,123 --> 00:58:01,852
Yeah, why?

748
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:05,459
Oh, my God.

749
00:58:05,562 --> 00:58:09,623
You're the guy that got caught
jerking off in study hall.

750
00:58:10,133 --> 00:58:12,897
I've heard that story, like,
a million times. You're a legend.

751
00:58:13,069 --> 00:58:13,899
Can you just do me a favor?

752
00:58:14,004 --> 00:58:15,232
Can you just humor me
for a second,

753
00:58:15,338 --> 00:58:18,273
and can you just tell me
your version of this, please?

754
00:58:18,441 --> 00:58:21,005
So many facts about that story
have gotten twisted around.

755
00:58:21,111 --> 00:58:21,977
Yeah.

756
00:58:22,078 --> 00:58:23,675
I mean, I barely even got started.

757
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:24,712
All right.

758
00:58:24,815 --> 00:58:26,715
- No, no, listen to me.
- Okay.

759
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:28,408
I was... it was a study hall,

760
00:58:28,518 --> 00:58:30,645
and everybody was
on a field trip that day.

761
00:58:30,754 --> 00:58:33,552
I was alone. I was all by myself,
and I barely even...

762
00:58:34,825 --> 00:58:36,349
And well, no, listen.

763
00:58:36,459 --> 00:58:39,485
And later I found out that there was
a hidden camera in that classroom.

764
00:58:39,596 --> 00:58:41,120
I have a solid case against it.

765
00:58:42,399 --> 00:58:45,891
- Gregory, I'm sorry.
- Cut it out.

766
00:58:46,002 --> 00:58:48,630
- Iùs not funny, you're right.
- Shut up.

767
00:58:48,738 --> 00:58:50,330
Iùs really fucking funny.

768
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:54,069
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

769
00:58:54,244 --> 00:58:56,178
I could shoot you in the face!

770
00:58:56,346 --> 00:58:58,746
Do you know how fucking
embarrassing that was for me?

771
00:58:58,915 --> 00:59:01,315
My parents thought I was a freak.

772
00:59:01,484 --> 00:59:03,179
The school played them
the video tape

773
00:59:03,353 --> 00:59:05,617
as if me admitting to it
wasn't enough.

774
00:59:06,223 --> 00:59:07,815
They said I needed therapy.

775
00:59:07,924 --> 00:59:10,154
Therapy? For what?

776
00:59:11,094 --> 00:59:13,255
Fuck therapy, and fuck you,

777
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:17,457
and fuck all of this,
and fuck my... fuck!

778
00:59:17,634 --> 00:59:19,261
Oh, goddamnit!

779
00:59:19,436 --> 00:59:20,596
God!

780
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:25,503
Oh, fuck!

781
00:59:31,915 --> 00:59:33,507
Fuck!

782
00:59:45,729 --> 00:59:46,821
Can I see it?

783
00:59:46,997 --> 00:59:48,294
No! Get away from me!

784
00:59:48,398 --> 00:59:51,561
Let me see it.
I'm a nurse's aide. Come on.

785
00:59:53,370 --> 00:59:57,773
I broke it. I fuckin' know I did.
I fuckin' broke it.

786
01:00:02,245 --> 01:00:04,907
Hey, where are you goin'?

787
01:00:12,389 --> 01:00:14,084
Oh, God!

788
01:00:19,696 --> 01:00:21,027
Come here.

789
01:00:22,666 --> 01:00:24,327
Put it in there.

790
01:00:29,506 --> 01:00:31,872
Just let it cool for a second.

791
01:00:39,382 --> 01:00:41,441
Oh, God.

792
01:00:51,928 --> 01:00:54,453
I broke it. I know I fuckin' broke it.
I know I did.

793
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:57,762
Does this hurt?

794
01:00:57,867 --> 01:00:59,061
Yes!

795
01:00:59,169 --> 01:01:00,693
Okay.

796
01:01:08,979 --> 01:01:10,947
Hello?

797
01:01:12,248 --> 01:01:15,308
Yeah. Yeah, Ma.

798
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:18,152
No.

799
01:01:18,321 --> 01:01:20,346
No, Ma, I don't know.

800
01:01:20,457 --> 01:01:22,857
No. No, I won't be home for dinner.

801
01:01:22,959 --> 01:01:24,654
Because I won't.

802
01:01:25,528 --> 01:01:28,759
Yes, I have my key. Yes.

803
01:01:29,466 --> 01:01:31,627
I can handle it, all right?

804
01:01:34,537 --> 01:01:35,697
Sorry.

805
01:01:35,805 --> 01:01:36,931
You live at home?

806
01:01:37,874 --> 01:01:39,569
Yeah.

807
01:01:40,710 --> 01:01:41,836
Like, with your whole family,

808
01:01:41,945 --> 01:01:43,776
like, your mom and your dad
and everyone?

809
01:01:43,947 --> 01:01:49,817
My dad, my mom, my sister,
my older brother, our dog Steve.

810
01:01:49,986 --> 01:01:51,453
Iùs really embarrassing, right?

811
01:01:51,554 --> 01:01:55,456
Iùs kind of cool actually.
I'm a little jealous.

812
01:01:56,159 --> 01:02:01,529
I wish I lived with my parents,
you know.

813
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:06,391
My dad left, like, pretty soon
after I was born,

814
01:02:06,503 --> 01:02:08,368
so I don't really know him.

815
01:02:08,471 --> 01:02:10,029
So it was just me and my mom,
you know.

816
01:02:10,206 --> 01:02:12,470
So my mom was, like,
my best friend, you know.

817
01:02:12,575 --> 01:02:14,270
Iùs just me and her.

818
01:02:14,377 --> 01:02:18,973
And then, um,
when I was 14, she died, so...

819
01:02:19,082 --> 01:02:22,848
And then I lived with my aunt,
and I finished high school there.

820
01:02:24,187 --> 01:02:28,214
She, um... we didn't get along.

821
01:02:29,292 --> 01:02:35,128
So you're kind of lucky,
just so you know.

822
01:02:37,534 --> 01:02:39,126
What did she die of?

823
01:02:39,302 --> 01:02:41,395
She had cancer.

824
01:02:41,571 --> 01:02:45,166
I'm sorry.
Iùs none of my business.

825
01:02:45,275 --> 01:02:46,242
Iùs fine.

826
01:02:49,212 --> 01:02:51,874
How is it with your family?

827
01:02:52,048 --> 01:02:54,039
All right, I guess.

828
01:02:58,321 --> 01:03:00,255
Do they know
that you run around with a gun

829
01:03:00,356 --> 01:03:02,483
trying to rob a fast food restaurant?

830
01:03:02,659 --> 01:03:04,320
No. They wouldn't think
I had the balls to do that

831
01:03:04,427 --> 01:03:06,895
in a million years.

832
01:03:06,996 --> 01:03:11,399
They think I'm just... mediocre.

833
01:03:11,868 --> 01:03:14,336
I mean, I always wanted
to do something.

834
01:03:14,504 --> 01:03:17,029
You know, something to show them

835
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:20,837
that I'm man enough to actually
do something with my life.

836
01:03:20,944 --> 01:03:22,969
That I'm not...

837
01:03:23,079 --> 01:03:25,274
that I'm not worthless.

838
01:03:25,381 --> 01:03:29,408
Yeah, thaùs the word
I was looking for... worthless.

839
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:35,081
I just... I just don't want them
to think that I'm a pussy.

840
01:03:38,595 --> 01:03:41,496
I think they think
I'm stupid or something.

841
01:03:42,098 --> 01:03:44,430
I don't think they think that.

842
01:03:44,534 --> 01:03:47,332
No, I mean,
I did try to do something.

843
01:03:47,437 --> 01:03:48,961
I really, really did.

844
01:03:49,139 --> 01:03:53,667
I mean, sometimes good stuff
just doesn't happen to people.

845
01:03:53,776 --> 01:03:56,870
I mean, maybe if I had a little luck,
but I didn't,

846
01:03:56,980 --> 01:04:01,644
and... and so things just didn't
work out like I planned.

847
01:04:02,218 --> 01:04:04,083
Why don't you write another book?

848
01:04:04,254 --> 01:04:07,052
Ha-ha-ha. Yeah, thaùs funny.

849
01:04:08,057 --> 01:04:09,991
Don't make me laugh.

850
01:04:10,093 --> 01:04:12,323
No, I'm serious.

851
01:04:12,929 --> 01:04:14,624
I mean, do you think your parents
will love you more

852
01:04:14,731 --> 01:04:17,928
if you become a career criminal
and get shot?

853
01:04:18,101 --> 01:04:21,093
At least they'll know
I'm not a coward.

854
01:04:22,672 --> 01:04:25,266
Can I see your hand?

855
01:04:38,354 --> 01:04:41,482
Ow. Can you help me?

856
01:04:42,325 --> 01:04:44,190
Well, I tied you up good.

857
01:04:55,004 --> 01:04:56,266
Let me see.

858
01:05:25,935 --> 01:05:27,562
Shit!

859
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:35,509
You don't dick with the Crolick.

860
01:05:36,379 --> 01:05:38,040
Are you talking to me?

861
01:05:38,214 --> 01:05:42,310
You must be talking to me,
'cause I'm the only Crolick here.

862
01:05:44,754 --> 01:05:46,415
Are you talking to me?

863
01:05:47,790 --> 01:05:49,690
Yeah, watch yourself.

864
01:05:49,859 --> 01:05:52,020
You want piece of me?
You want a piece of me?

865
01:05:52,128 --> 01:05:55,188
Would you like
several pieces of me?

866
01:05:55,365 --> 01:05:57,299
Yeah. Yeah, mister!

867
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,833
Take that. Yeah!

868
01:06:01,204 --> 01:06:04,230
I almost had a heart attack
when you came to me with that knife.

869
01:06:06,042 --> 01:06:07,509
Which time?

870
01:06:07,610 --> 01:06:11,046
The second time.
The first one, I didn't see coming.

871
01:06:11,147 --> 01:06:12,136
Well, what did you expect?

872
01:06:12,248 --> 01:06:14,808
I thought you're, like,
the hitcher or something.

873
01:06:14,917 --> 01:06:16,646
- The hitcher?
- Uh-huh.

874
01:06:16,753 --> 01:06:18,983
You're the one who almost took
my head off with that machete.

875
01:06:19,088 --> 01:06:20,612
You're the one who kidnaps me.

876
01:06:20,790 --> 01:06:22,917
Yeah? Well, you're the one
who couldn't even say hello to me.

877
01:06:23,092 --> 01:06:26,255
- You looked creepy.
- I thought we had a moment.

878
01:06:26,429 --> 01:06:28,090
You put a gun in my hip.

879
01:06:29,299 --> 01:06:33,235
Yeah. I was going
through a rough patch.

880
01:06:35,004 --> 01:06:37,370
You were under a lot of pressure.

881
01:06:40,576 --> 01:06:43,306
Plus, I probably stank.

882
01:06:44,781 --> 01:06:46,612
Is that a mustard stain?

883
01:06:46,783 --> 01:06:48,774
It could be.

884
01:06:50,386 --> 01:06:54,413
Somebody should really clean
the ceilings in these places.

885
01:06:54,524 --> 01:06:56,424
How do you clean a ceiling?

886
01:06:56,526 --> 01:06:58,084
Thaùs what I'm trying to figure out.

887
01:07:08,805 --> 01:07:11,000
Oh, shit!

888
01:07:14,410 --> 01:07:17,038
I never a minute of peace.

889
01:07:17,146 --> 01:07:18,306
Enter!

890
01:07:18,614 --> 01:07:20,241
Mr. Crolick.

891
01:07:20,350 --> 01:07:22,181
We had a little malfunction
in the bathrooms,

892
01:07:22,285 --> 01:07:23,650
but I took care of it, sir.

893
01:07:23,753 --> 01:07:25,152
There's no problemo.

894
01:07:26,289 --> 01:07:29,486
Yeah, well, I used my best instincts
just like you instructed me, sir.

895
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:33,727
Very good, lad.
Very, very good, Jason.

896
01:07:37,834 --> 01:07:40,496
So, what you doin', sir?

897
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:42,331
I'm making a shank.

898
01:07:42,505 --> 01:07:48,375
I'm reading the... the paper.
Thaùs all.

899
01:07:53,483 --> 01:07:55,542
Well, if you, uh,
check the lavatory, sir,

900
01:07:55,651 --> 01:07:56,948
check them for leaks.

901
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:02,384
You know, leaks.
Little bathroom humor.

902
01:08:02,558 --> 01:08:03,616
Sorry.

903
01:08:04,961 --> 01:08:07,657
Good. Iùs good. Thaùs a good one.

904
01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:10,390
No, you know what, I'm gonna
do that later. Thank you, Jason.

905
01:08:10,566 --> 01:08:11,692
Very well, sir.

906
01:08:11,868 --> 01:08:13,028
Great.

907
01:08:21,077 --> 01:08:22,339
Go away, Jason.

908
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:24,746
Oh, yeah, yeah.

909
01:08:25,915 --> 01:08:28,713
Sorry. All right. See you.

910
01:08:32,755 --> 01:08:35,724
Good grief!

911
01:08:36,793 --> 01:08:38,192
Stool.

912
01:08:38,361 --> 01:08:40,226
You know what I hate?
What?

913
01:08:40,329 --> 01:08:42,456
The guys who are on MTV
who are always bragging

914
01:08:42,565 --> 01:08:45,591
about their cribs
and their hoes and their grills.

915
01:08:45,768 --> 01:08:48,703
I don't understand
little ketchup packs.

916
01:08:48,805 --> 01:08:50,432
Why did they make them so small?

917
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:53,668
You have to use 20 ketchup packs
just to eat a thing of French fries.

918
01:08:53,776 --> 01:08:56,336
Iùs a waste. Iùs a waste of plastic.
I'm just saying.

919
01:08:56,512 --> 01:08:58,912
- Oh, you know what I don't get?
- What?

920
01:08:59,015 --> 01:09:01,950
Dudes with ponytails.

921
01:09:04,487 --> 01:09:05,977
You know what I don't get?

922
01:09:06,088 --> 01:09:07,248
Soft-core porn.

923
01:09:07,356 --> 01:09:10,052
You know, iùs like two hours
of a bad story

924
01:09:10,159 --> 01:09:15,062
mixed in with 15 minutes
of fake sex and bad acting.

925
01:09:17,834 --> 01:09:20,234
Why do you have a camera?

926
01:09:23,539 --> 01:09:24,699
Can I see it?

927
01:09:24,807 --> 01:09:26,399
Yeah, go ahead.

928
01:09:26,576 --> 01:09:28,908
I mean, there's no tape in it.

929
01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:37,082
You know what I don't get?

930
01:09:37,186 --> 01:09:37,948
Laid.

931
01:09:41,624 --> 01:09:43,057
<i>This is Joe.
- Thaùs a good one.</i>

932
01:09:43,226 --> 01:09:46,593
<i>Today, I'm the ruler of my destiny.</i>

933
01:09:46,696 --> 01:09:48,994
<i>Today, I make justice my way.</i>

934
01:09:49,799 --> 01:09:52,734
<i>With this, I'll make your blood spill,</i>

935
01:09:52,835 --> 01:09:56,965
<i>and you'll forever remember
what you have all done to me.</i>

936
01:09:57,106 --> 01:09:57,970
Give me that!

937
01:09:58,140 --> 01:09:59,232
<i>- This is Joe.
- Fuck!</i>

938
01:09:59,609 --> 01:10:02,077
<i>This is Joe. This is Joe.</i>

939
01:10:02,178 --> 01:10:03,736
Oh, fuck!

940
01:10:23,833 --> 01:10:26,859
Fucking memory card.

941
01:10:30,773 --> 01:10:34,573
You weren't gonna rob the place,
were you?

942
01:10:45,087 --> 01:10:47,817
I was watching this show
on the Discovery Channel

943
01:10:47,924 --> 01:10:50,358
about taboos.

944
01:10:51,561 --> 01:10:53,859
On the Taiwanese food market,
you can buy stuff

945
01:10:53,963 --> 01:10:59,732
like pig brains and, like,
dog testicles and snakes and stuff.

946
01:11:02,004 --> 01:11:04,734
Yeah, I think I saw it.

947
01:11:06,876 --> 01:11:09,436
Iùs pretty creepy, huh?

948
01:11:09,545 --> 01:11:11,035
Yeah.

949
01:11:12,481 --> 01:11:17,316
Yeah. Kind of like me.

950
01:11:23,526 --> 01:11:25,858
I don't know what to do.

951
01:11:26,028 --> 01:11:29,293
I just feel all this pressure.

952
01:11:30,032 --> 01:11:33,331
I remember when my mom died.

953
01:11:34,537 --> 01:11:37,904
I remember sitting in a bathtub
filled with water...

954
01:11:39,241 --> 01:11:42,836
...holding the plugged-in hairdryer
over the water.

955
01:11:44,013 --> 01:11:46,072
I was holding it by the wire.

956
01:11:46,916 --> 01:11:49,180
Just holding it.

957
01:11:50,186 --> 01:11:52,245
I don't know what I was thinking.

958
01:11:54,724 --> 01:11:58,353
The weird thing is
it wasn't even about my mom.

959
01:12:00,196 --> 01:12:03,859
I just kind of wanted everything
to just stop, you know.

960
01:12:03,966 --> 01:12:08,096
Just... just be quiet for a second.

961
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:14,102
You know what I mean?

962
01:12:16,912 --> 01:12:19,005
I know the feeling.

963
01:12:26,689 --> 01:12:28,418
I'm sorry.

964
01:12:30,493 --> 01:12:31,983
Yeah.

965
01:12:33,596 --> 01:12:35,086
Yeah.

966
01:12:35,498 --> 01:12:36,294
Yeah.

967
01:13:05,861 --> 01:13:08,659
<i>? Another lazy afternoon?</i>

968
01:13:08,764 --> 01:13:13,724
<i>? I know you think iùs time for me
to do some moving?</i>

969
01:13:13,836 --> 01:13:17,636
<i>? But iùs hard to get started
and dust my broom?</i>

970
01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:21,335
<i>? My broom has passed by
for several times now?</i>

971
01:13:21,877 --> 01:13:24,641
<i>? This day is just one out of many?</i>

972
01:13:26,582 --> 01:13:30,074
<i>? You know I am lazy
so stop telling me so?</i>

973
01:13:30,352 --> 01:13:32,616
Iùs nice out tonight.

974
01:13:33,422 --> 01:13:35,754
Iùs the last day of summer.

975
01:13:36,892 --> 01:13:41,488
Yeah. But we still have fall.

976
01:13:45,634 --> 01:13:47,397
So how's your...?

977
01:13:50,639 --> 01:13:52,903
It should be gone by next Friday.

978
01:13:53,642 --> 01:13:55,371
How's your...?

979
01:13:56,245 --> 01:14:00,079
Um, iùs all right, I guess.

980
01:14:00,182 --> 01:14:02,412
Doesn't hurt anymore.

981
01:14:02,518 --> 01:14:04,349
Good.

982
01:14:04,453 --> 01:14:05,886
Yeah.

983
01:14:09,291 --> 01:14:13,694
So, how about dinner sometime?

984
01:14:13,796 --> 01:14:15,058
Maybe tomorrow?

985
01:14:17,066 --> 01:14:20,035
Yeah, I know.

986
01:14:23,005 --> 01:14:29,003
Well, I've got to get rid of this,
so...

987
01:14:49,698 --> 01:14:51,131
Stephanie.

988
01:15:04,013 --> 01:15:06,504
<i>? Oh, I can live without?</i>

989
01:15:06,615 --> 01:15:09,675
<i>? I can live without a thought?</i>

990
01:15:09,819 --> 01:15:12,754
<i>? Of going home?</i>

991
01:15:13,556 --> 01:15:16,116
<i>? Oh, I can see it hurts?</i>

992
01:15:16,225 --> 01:15:21,128
<i>? I can see whatever is in there?</i>

993
01:15:21,230 --> 01:15:23,494
<i>? I can change my clothes?</i>

994
01:15:23,599 --> 01:15:26,830
<i>? I can change my everything?</i>

995
01:15:26,936 --> 01:15:30,235
<i>? To make your mind speak?</i>

996
01:15:30,406 --> 01:15:32,874
<i>? I wish you were right here?</i>

997
01:15:32,975 --> 01:15:36,672
<i>? I wish you were
just every day with me?</i>

998
01:15:40,449 --> 01:15:42,747
<i>? Here I go?</i>

999
01:15:42,852 --> 01:15:45,480
<i>? On my own?</i>

1000
01:15:45,588 --> 01:15:48,557
<i>? Well, thaùs better than waiting?</i>

1001
01:15:48,657 --> 01:15:50,648
<i>? Here I go?</i>

1002
01:15:50,826 --> 01:15:53,624
<i>? On my own?</i>

1003
01:15:53,729 --> 01:15:57,722
<i>? Must be better than waiting?</i>

1004
01:15:57,833 --> 01:16:00,028
<i>? I could hold your hand?</i>

1005
01:16:00,135 --> 01:16:03,366
<i>? I could hold your hand real tight?</i>

1006
01:16:09,812 --> 01:16:11,006
Gregory.

1007
01:16:11,113 --> 01:16:12,546
Crolick.

1008
01:16:14,884 --> 01:16:17,045
How are you, pal?

1009
01:16:18,387 --> 01:16:19,877
What are you...?

1010
01:16:19,989 --> 01:16:22,617
What are you doin'
around these parts?

1011
01:16:24,026 --> 01:16:25,994
Hey, would you like a late dinner?

1012
01:16:26,095 --> 01:16:28,393
I think we have some leftovers.

1013
01:16:28,564 --> 01:16:30,259
Meatloaf, I think.

1014
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:37,406
Listen, uh, I always thought
that you were a great employee.

1015
01:16:39,008 --> 01:16:44,972
But, you know, there... there's
always room for creative criticism.

1016
01:16:46,115 --> 01:16:47,844
Creative criticism.

1017
01:16:48,017 --> 01:16:49,450
Yeah. Well iùs, you know...

1018
01:16:49,551 --> 01:16:52,019
Iùs an important part
of being a boss.

1019
01:16:52,187 --> 01:16:55,588
You made me dive
into a fucking toilet bowl.

1020
01:16:55,758 --> 01:16:59,819
Yeah, well, these are decisions
that I have to live with.

1021
01:17:02,932 --> 01:17:05,867
Would you, uh...
would you like your old job back?

1022
01:17:06,568 --> 01:17:08,502
My job back?

1023
01:17:08,671 --> 01:17:11,367
Yeah, uh, um, dishwasher.

1024
01:17:11,473 --> 01:17:15,409
I could upgrade you to dishwasher
or potato peeler. Thaùs even better.

1025
01:17:15,577 --> 01:17:17,204
Anything higher than that,
we got to retrain you...

1026
01:17:17,379 --> 01:17:19,745
- Shut up.
- Okay.

1027
01:17:22,751 --> 01:17:27,518
Hey, Crolick,
how are your toilet bowls now?

1028
01:17:28,657 --> 01:17:32,252
They're fine. They're very good.
We have a new lad.

1029
01:17:35,464 --> 01:17:37,125
Oh, God.

1030
01:17:39,902 --> 01:17:42,268
Do you want to make a move
on me now, huh?

1031
01:17:43,572 --> 01:17:45,096
No.

1032
01:17:46,408 --> 01:17:48,399
Do you want to order me
around now?

1033
01:17:48,877 --> 01:17:50,504
No, I don't.

1034
01:17:51,413 --> 01:17:55,349
Yeah, thaùs right.

1035
01:17:55,451 --> 01:17:57,612
You can't make me do shit.

1036
01:17:57,786 --> 01:17:59,651
You got that?

1037
01:18:01,423 --> 01:18:04,153
I hate you, Crolick.

1038
01:18:04,326 --> 01:18:07,489
I hate you
because you're an asshole.

1039
01:18:07,596 --> 01:18:13,057
And I'm not gonna fuck up my life
over you, lad.

1040
01:18:13,202 --> 01:18:14,362
Gregory, listen. L...

1041
01:18:14,470 --> 01:18:16,404
- My name is Joe.
- Of course.

1042
01:18:16,505 --> 01:18:20,805
I hate the name Gregory.
I always have. Iùs fuckin' stupid.

1043
01:18:20,909 --> 01:18:24,811
I agree. Thaùs a stupid name.

1044
01:18:27,149 --> 01:18:29,276
I'm Joe.

1045
01:18:30,853 --> 01:18:33,879
And you can go flush yourself.

1046
01:18:37,693 --> 01:18:38,455
No.

1047
01:18:38,627 --> 01:18:41,152
You know what, Crolick?

1048
01:18:42,264 --> 01:18:44,164
You're not the problem, man.

1049
01:18:44,333 --> 01:18:47,666
You might be the biggest asshole
in the world,
