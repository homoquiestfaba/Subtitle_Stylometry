32
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,450
- Yeah, that's me.

33
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,233
- Sorry, I was late, my GPS.
- Don't sweat it, it's okay.

34
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,483
- Ah, 12.99.

35
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,183
- Gotcha.

36
00:02:54,554 --> 00:02:55,980
- I'm sorry, I-I can't break this.

37
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,530
- It's all right, it's all you.

38
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,573
- [Alex] Thanks.

39
00:02:59,573 --> 00:03:00,406
- Of course.

40
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:05,340
- Ah, enjoy the Hawaiian
pizza, it's-it's my favorite.

41
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,475
I know, I'm sorry.

42
00:03:06,475 --> 00:03:07,308
- Really?

43
00:03:07,308 --> 00:03:08,197
- [Alex] Yeah.

44
00:03:08,197 --> 00:03:11,530
- Do you wanna maybe come in, have some?

45
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,700
- I can't.

46
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,200
- Sure?

47
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,339
- Yeah, I'm supposed to see my dad.

48
00:03:18,339 --> 00:03:19,620
(Randy laughing)
Yeah, bye.

49
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,453

(phone ringing)

52
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,730
- [Jack] Alex, it's Jack, you
forgot another pizza again.

53
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,950
I had to have one of the
other guys deliver it

54
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,540
and it was 20 minutes late.

55
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,000
Guess who's paying for
that motherfucking pizza?

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,810
You, I'm docking your pay,
I told you a dozen times

57
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,486
to check the tickets before you leave.

58
00:03:48,486 --> 00:03:51,736
(gentle melodic music)

59
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,433
(drawer thudding)

60
00:04:05,196 --> 00:04:06,029
- Hey.

61
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:07,943
- Hey.

62
00:04:07,943 --> 00:04:09,323
- [Gracie] Are you there yet?

63
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:12,112
- I'm outside.

64
00:04:12,112 --> 00:04:14,625
- You can do this, Alex.

65
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,740
- This isn't gonna work.

66
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,230
- Maybe he's changed.

67
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,868
- [Alex] Gracie, not my dad.

68
00:04:19,868 --> 00:04:21,115
- Well, you changed.

69
00:04:21,115 --> 00:04:23,100
- Because I got sober.

70
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,233
He's just an angry,

71
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,633
drunk, old man.

72
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:31,943
Would you eat that
fucking candy bar already?

73
00:04:31,943 --> 00:04:34,577
- I'm stressed, okay.
- Would you stop?

74
00:04:34,577 --> 00:04:36,390
You're an amazing artist

75
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,520
and your first show's gonna be great.

76
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,353
- I hope you're right.

77
00:04:39,353 --> 00:04:42,660
I've got two weeks and I don't feel ready.

78
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,110
Oh, my boss's husband is
coming, he's a music manager

79
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,647
and I told him all about you.

80
00:04:47,647 --> 00:04:49,673
- You're always looking out for me.

81
00:04:49,673 --> 00:04:51,840
- [Gracie] I got you, boo.

82
00:04:53,718 --> 00:04:56,013
- I really don't wanna do this.

83
00:04:57,502 --> 00:04:59,917
- You know, you once told me

84
00:04:59,917 --> 00:05:04,603
everyone deserves a second
chance and I gave you one, right?

85
00:05:04,603 --> 00:05:06,463
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

86
00:05:07,546 --> 00:05:09,060
- Talk to your sponsor.

87
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,220
- You told her to call me?

88
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,153
- Love you.

89
00:05:14,418 --> 00:05:17,272
(phone ringing)

90
00:05:17,272 --> 00:05:18,870
- You hate video calls.

91
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,267
- Oh, I know.

92
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:24,333
I'm just checking on you, honey, you okay?

93
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,730
- No.

94
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:31,080
- Alex, I want you to
think back a year ago.

95
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,873
If it helps you stay sober, it's worth it.

96
00:05:34,795 --> 00:05:38,002
You've been mad at your
father your whole life.

97
00:05:38,002 --> 00:05:41,523
You need to talk to him,
tell him what he did wrong.

98
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,333
He may not change, but you will.

99
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,469
- Ronnie, you ever been this angry?

100
00:05:47,469 --> 00:05:49,683
- (laughing) Oh, yeah,

101
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,300
so angry

102
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,640
at myself,
(gentle melodic music)

103
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,660
but I had to let it go if
I wanted to stay sober.

104
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,997
- Okay, so I stay sober, then what?

105
00:06:02,997 --> 00:06:04,533
- And then you're free.

106
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:09,873
Alex, your father made your life hell,

107
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,360
but if you can think of him
as sick, instead of bad,

108
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:21,573
the shift in your perception
might be the miracle you need.

109
00:06:23,422 --> 00:06:25,290
- I'll call you after.

110
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,300
- I love you.
- Love you too.

111
00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:32,729
(TV static hissing)

112
00:06:41,536 --> 00:06:42,369
Dad.

113
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,493
Dad.

114
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:51,152
Hello? (knocking)

115
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,480
(door clicking)
Dad.

116
00:07:11,724 --> 00:07:12,557
Dad.

117
00:07:16,933 --> 00:07:17,766
Hello.

118
00:07:23,425 --> 00:07:26,675
(faucet water running)

119
00:07:41,398 --> 00:07:42,790
Dad.

120
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:43,623
You home?

121
00:08:16,353 --> 00:08:19,020
(Alex vomiting)

122
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:30,917
(police radio broadcasting quietly)

123
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:34,170
- Detective Braden
Cole, Slowsburgh County.

124
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:36,420
Mind if I ask you a few questions?

125
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,253
- Yeah, sure.

126
00:08:37,253 --> 00:08:39,360
- [Braden] You live here with your dad?

127
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,310
- No, um, actually I
haven't seen him in a while.

128
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,143
- Why?

129
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:48,689
- We weren't that close?

130
00:08:48,689 --> 00:08:49,556
- I see.

131
00:08:49,556 --> 00:08:51,663
What were you doing here today?

132
00:08:52,537 --> 00:08:54,780
- I don't have to tell you that.

133
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,073
- Alex, just tell her.

134
00:08:57,229 --> 00:09:01,080
He was coming up to talk to
his dad to work things out.

135
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,500
- Alex is sober,
Detective, almost one year.

136
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,073
The time apart from his
dad, he needed it to heal.

137
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:09,893
- I see.

138
00:09:12,007 --> 00:09:13,473
- I didn't kill my father.

139
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,633
- I never said you did,
can you think of a reason

140
00:09:17,633 --> 00:09:21,243
why someone would do this
to your dad, anger anyone?

141
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
- No, he was, he was kind of a loner.

142
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:30,617
- If you think of
anything, here's my number.

143
00:09:32,048 --> 00:09:33,150
- Thank you.

144
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,600
- I might have a few more
questions later on too.

145
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,153
I'm sorry for your loss.

146
00:09:44,332 --> 00:09:48,582
♪ I was wondering what you thought ♪

147
00:09:52,387 --> 00:09:53,720
- How you doing?

148
00:09:59,777 --> 00:10:00,610
- Just,

149
00:10:01,737 --> 00:10:03,900
who would do this?

150
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,733
Why?

151
00:10:07,002 --> 00:10:12,002
- There are a lot of really
sick people in this world.

152
00:10:12,193 --> 00:10:16,743
- Nothing was stolen, it
just, it doesn't make sense.

153
00:10:18,522 --> 00:10:20,640
- Did he have any enemies?

154
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,433
- No, didn't have any friends either.

155
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,916
Why do I miss him?

156
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,933
- He was your dad, Alex.

157
00:10:32,313 --> 00:10:34,323
It's okay that you loved him.

158
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:41,853
- I don't know what to do. (sighing)

159
00:10:43,229 --> 00:10:44,541
- Honey.

160
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:47,624
(soft melodic music)

161
00:11:01,198 --> 00:11:03,690
- I can't believe this house is mine.

162
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:08,061
- Yeah, along with the
mortgage and the unpaid bills,

163
00:11:08,061 --> 00:11:11,190
seems your dad was falling
a little behind, honey.

164
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,180
- How much?

165
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,228
- Almost $5.000 and I'm not even done

166
00:11:14,228 --> 00:11:16,682
going through everything yet.

167
00:11:16,682 --> 00:11:17,826
- Well, sell his car.

168
00:11:17,826 --> 00:11:21,332
- You'd be lucky if you got
$500 for that old wreck,

169
00:11:21,332 --> 00:11:23,502
but you could sell the house though.

170
00:11:23,502 --> 00:11:25,067
- It's probably worth a lot.

171
00:11:25,067 --> 00:11:27,512
You could pay off the
mortgage and keep the rest.

172
00:11:27,512 --> 00:11:29,550
- I don't wanna sell the house.

173
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,309
- Well, where are you
gonna get five grand?

174
00:11:31,309 --> 00:11:32,220
- I don't know.
- And how are you gonna

175
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,470
pay the mortgage, delivering pizzas?

176
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,795
- I'll figure it out.

177
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:38,369
- Well, don't forget
property taxes and insurance.

178
00:11:38,369 --> 00:11:40,497
When something goes
wrong, you gotta fix it.

179
00:11:40,497 --> 00:11:42,210
- I'm not selling the house, Ronnie.

180
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,440
- Why not?
(Veronica sighing)

181
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,266
- Because when else am I
gonna be given a house?

182
00:11:46,266 --> 00:11:48,884
- Well, to be fair, a house
is a solid investment.

183
00:11:48,884 --> 00:11:50,820
You can't go wrong with real estate.

184
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,440
- Yeah and with both of us living here,

185
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,142
it'd be half the mortgage, half the bills.

186
00:11:54,142 --> 00:11:55,770
- I do not wanna live here.

187
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,800
- Why not, because my dad was killed here?

188
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,745
- That and it's in Slowsburgh,

189
00:12:02,745 --> 00:12:05,940
I don't wanna drive 45
minutes back and forth

190
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,110
to work every day.

191
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,835
- GJ, it's a huge house

192
00:12:08,835 --> 00:12:12,213
and we live in a dinky, little shithole.

193
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:17,133
- I love our dinky, little
shithole and it's a night.

194
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,748
- So now what?

195
00:12:20,748 --> 00:12:25,748
- Don't worry about me, the
house is a big deal, I get it.

196
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,303
Do what you need to do.

197
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,733
- Hey, come here.

198
00:12:34,437 --> 00:12:36,873
You're gonna have to get a roommate, baby.

199
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,630
- No pressure.

200
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,713
- Oh, an artiste.

201
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,650
- Well, I'm just starting.
- Don't be modest.

202
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,021
- I am, but if you can come,

203
00:12:49,021 --> 00:12:51,870
it would be a great chance for
us to get to know each other.

204
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,420
You are hands down our favorite applicant.

205
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,713
- Stop it.
- Hey.

206
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,770
- Ah, can we help you?

207
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:01,290
- I'm here about the room for rent?

208
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,093
I knocked, but nobody heard me.

209
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,892
- Ah, I don't have anyone else listed.

210
00:13:07,892 --> 00:13:10,743
- I was driving by and I
saw the sign out front.

211
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,493
Shane Collins.

212
00:13:16,619 --> 00:13:18,570
- I-I'm Alex.

213
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:20,855
- Well, I will let you all do your thing.

214
00:13:20,855 --> 00:13:23,133
Come on, Peachy, come on, baby.

215
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:30,130
Ah, we could always share the room.

216
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,740
(Shane laughing)

217
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,660
Just mull it over.

218
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,010
Bye, y'all.

219
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:35,970
- Not shy, is he?

220
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:38,070
- You must be used to it, you know,

221
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,612
what are you, like a,
like a model or something?

222
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:43,953
- (laughing) No, I'm a trainer.

223
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,963
- Nice.
- Yeah.

224
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,442
Do you work out?

225
00:13:48,442 --> 00:13:51,810
- Oh, struggling a little
bit, if I'm being honest,

226
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:55,590
but I just need like a little motivation.

227
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,856
- I could help with that.

228
00:13:56,856 --> 00:13:58,181
- [Alex] Yeah?

229
00:13:58,181 --> 00:14:02,610
- Yeah, maybe I could train you sometime.

230
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:07,610
- Wow, that's like a
scary, generous offer.

231
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,963
Thanks.
- Yeah.

232
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,813
Can I see the room?

233
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:14,786
- Yeah.

234
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,753
Yeah.

235
00:14:17,753 --> 00:14:20,780
- Sure, sure, it's just this way.

236
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:24,197
(gentle melodic music)

237
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,379
- [Shane] You don't want this room?

238
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:29,610
- I like my room, besides
this was my parents' room

239
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:32,537
and they, they don't...

240
00:14:32,537 --> 00:14:33,537
- They what?

241
00:14:35,088 --> 00:14:36,543
- They passed away.

242
00:14:37,921 --> 00:14:40,380
- And you don't wanna sleep in their room?

243
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,063
- Yeah.
- That makes sense.

244
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,093
Did they pass away together?

245
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:49,293
- No, ah, my mom died when I was a kid,

246
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,643
cancer and my dad, um,

247
00:14:54,743 --> 00:14:56,283
he had a heart attack.

248
00:14:57,424 --> 00:14:59,103
He died in his sleep though.

249
00:15:00,502 --> 00:15:02,250
- At home?

250
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:06,860
- No, no, Bear Mountain,
he loved it out there.

251
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,298
- That must have been quite a shock.

252
00:15:09,298 --> 00:15:10,131
- Yeah.

253
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,383
- This is beautiful.

254
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,590
Must be a nice having the
woods as your backyard.

255
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,065
- Yeah, yeah, totally.

256
00:15:21,065 --> 00:15:24,570
(Gracie clearing throat)

257
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,618
Ah, it is nice.

258
00:15:26,618 --> 00:15:28,380
- [Shane] Is this the bathroom?

259
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,348
- Yeah, feel free to check it out.

260
00:15:30,348 --> 00:15:33,846
(door clicking)

261
00:15:33,846 --> 00:15:36,114
(door thudding)

262
00:15:36,114 --> 00:15:39,482
- Do you believe in cosmic energy?

263
00:15:39,482 --> 00:15:42,107
- I, I don't know,
(laughing) what is that?

264
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,619
- (laughing) I don't know.

265
00:15:43,619 --> 00:15:45,300
- Well, when you walk into a room

266
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,791
and someone's sad or
angry, you can tell, right?

267
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,600
- Can you tell?

268
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,433
- I can tell.

269
00:15:52,433 --> 00:15:53,943
- Well, that's cosmic energy.

270
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,153
This room has a, a dark history.

271
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,180
Maybe if I move in,

272
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:07,413
we can figure it out together.

273
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:12,150
- Or you could just tell him, Alex.

274
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:15,075
- I was just about to, Gracie.

275
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:16,864
- Tell me what?

276
00:16:16,864 --> 00:16:19,375
(gentle melodic music)

277
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,613
- My, my dad,

278
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:27,340
he was a raging alcoholic,
like a mean, a mean drunk

279
00:16:28,984 --> 00:16:32,613
and I, I used to drink too
mostly to get back at him,

280
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,423
but I don't anymore.

281
00:16:38,423 --> 00:16:40,803
- You guys must've had some fights?

282
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,733
- Yeah.

283
00:16:45,115 --> 00:16:47,103
- Well, that doesn't bother me,

284
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,743
but I appreciate your honesty.

285
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,553
- Sweet.

286
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,250
- So I would pay rent
in cash if that's okay?

287
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,643
My clients pay in cash and I
don't really trust banks, so.

288
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:04,920
- Cash works for me.

289
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,070
- Well, it was really
nice meeting you, Shane.

290
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,960
We will let you know
by the end of the week.

291
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,390
- Yeah.
- Listen, Alex,

292
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:16,203
I like you and I, I like the place.

293
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:18,300
When it's right, I don't really hesitate,

294
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,428
so I kind of wanna know
now if that's okay.

295
00:17:22,428 --> 00:17:25,204
- (clears throat) Alex,
can I please talk with you

296
00:17:25,204 --> 00:17:26,838
for one moment in the kitchen?

297
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:28,569
- Yeah, just, just one second.

298
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:30,484
- I understand.

299
00:17:30,484 --> 00:17:32,640
Well, have a nice day both of you.

300
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,113
- No.
- Thanks.

301
00:17:36,486 --> 00:17:37,712
- GJ.
- What?

302
00:17:37,712 --> 00:17:38,823
What is your problem?

303
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,243
- Shane.

304
00:17:41,243 --> 00:17:42,870
- [Gracie] Alex.

305
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:43,703
- Yeah?

306
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,680
- It's yours.

307
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,730
- Yeah?

308
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:48,750
- Yeah.

309
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:52,380
- Cool, oh, last thing,

310
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,870
I'll need a place to
set up my workout area.

311
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:57,737
Not for clients or anything,
just for you and me.

312
00:17:57,737 --> 00:17:59,677
- Will the garage work?

313
00:17:59,677 --> 00:18:01,740
- That's perfect.

314
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,805
- Mind if I ask if you
do any drugs or drink?

315
00:18:05,805 --> 00:18:08,283
- I don't drink or do drugs, so.

316
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,573
We good?

317
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,480
- Yeah.
- We are also asking

318
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,183
for first month's, last and security.

319
00:18:19,562 --> 00:18:20,613
- Of course.

320
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,963
This would be first month,

321
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:33,933
last month and security.

322
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,210
Ah, I'll see you this weekend?

323
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,043
- Yeah.

324
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,003
Oh, one sec.

325
00:18:43,221 --> 00:18:45,876
(keys jangling)

326
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:48,120
These will work in all the doors.

327
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,298
- Thanks.

328
00:18:49,298 --> 00:18:52,193
(soft melodic music)

329
00:18:52,193 --> 00:18:54,063
I'll see you around, Gracie.

330
00:19:02,106 --> 00:19:04,640
(door clicking)

331
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,480
(door thudding)

332
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,680
- Freddy was nice.

333
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,443
- So was Shane, I don't
know why you don't like him.

334
00:19:10,443 --> 00:19:12,986
- (laughing) Doesn't trust banks

335
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:15,231
and who carries around that much cash?

336
00:19:15,231 --> 00:19:16,920
- You're overreacting.

337
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,890
- Really, hm, because
I searched the internet

338
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:23,310
for Mr. Pays in Cash
and guess what I found?

339
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,050
- What?
- Nothing!

340
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:27,810
No social media, not even
a stupid, shirtless pic

341
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,650
and every trainer has that.

342
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:32,145
- I'm a singer songwriter and
I don't have social media,

343
00:19:32,145 --> 00:19:33,840
every singer's got that.

344
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,820
- Yeah and a career, but you don't.

345
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,610
- Hey-o!
- Oh, keep?

346
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,603
- Absolutely not.

347
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:43,980
- Just take my word for it,
okay, he's hiding something.

348
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,093
- Hiding what?

349
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:52,290
- Okay, fine, whatever, just
do not hook up with him.

350
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:54,542
- Okay, like I have a chance.

351
00:19:54,542 --> 00:19:56,340
- You beat yourself up too much.

352
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,210
- Maybe if I start training with Shane,

353
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,169
I'll feel more confident.
- Just remember, Alex,

354
00:20:00,169 --> 00:20:02,317
you don't need this guy.

355
00:20:02,317 --> 00:20:04,308
He creeped me out.

356
00:20:04,308 --> 00:20:06,658
- I'll feel safer with
a guy like Shane around.

357
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:21,330
- You know, you could

360
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,713
Is that?

361
00:20:33,695 --> 00:20:37,754
(laughing) I haven't seen this in years.

362
00:20:37,754 --> 00:20:40,680
I remember you making
this for him at camp.

363
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,947
- Yeah, he used to say, "You're
a chip off the old block."

364
00:20:46,122 --> 00:20:47,853
Stupid that he kept it, right?

365
00:20:49,131 --> 00:20:49,964
- No.

366
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,273

375
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,330
- I didn't hear you come in, sorry.

376
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,250

379
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,872

380
00:21:25,872 --> 00:21:28,020
I got some workout stuff in the truck.

00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,280

rid of a lot of stuff,

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,780
that didn't spark joy.

383
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,833
- Spark joy?

384
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:37,263
- The lady on the TV, Marie something.

385
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,650
- I'd like to get the
gym set up in the garage,

386
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:42,660
so I can work out later.

387
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,237
- For sure, sure, can I help?

388
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:46,983
- Do you have a mirror?

389
00:21:48,195 --> 00:21:49,690

390
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,050
(chain rattling)

391
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:53,478
- How's this?

392
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,025
- Yeah, that's good.
- Yeah.

393
00:21:55,025 --> 00:21:57,480
- [Shane] Put it up against
the wall over there.

394
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,313
- Sure.

395
00:22:03,836 --> 00:22:07,833
- Was that one of your
songs you were writing?

396
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,370
- Trying to, I got stuck.

397
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:14,193
- Do you sell any of your songs?

398
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,935
- No, not yet, at least, um,
I've really gotta get myself

399
00:22:17,935 --> 00:22:19,849
out there more a little bit and-

400
00:22:19,849 --> 00:22:21,363
- What's stopping you?

401
00:22:23,862 --> 00:22:25,563
- I want them to be good enough.

402
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,919
- I see.

403
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:30,667
(Velcro crunching)

404
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:33,243
- [Alex] Is this all the stuff you use?

405
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:37,659
- I run once in a while.

406
00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:41,341
Sometimes I go to the gym,
but I don't like the gym,

407
00:22:41,341 --> 00:22:43,956
too many people sitting on their phones,

408
00:22:43,956 --> 00:22:45,830
wasting time at machines.

409
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:49,443
- I have a gym membership, but
I don't, I don't really go.

410
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:52,634
- That's a waste of money.

411
00:22:52,634 --> 00:22:54,030
- [Alex] I suppose.

412
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:57,300
- No, you don't suppose, if
you know something, say it,

413
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,533
say yes or no.

414
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,103
- Yes, I guess.

415
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:09,566
Yes, having a gym membership
is a waste of money,

416
00:23:09,566 --> 00:23:11,550
if you, if you don't go.

417
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,864
- There you go.
- Okay.

418
00:23:12,864 --> 00:23:14,103
- Is that so hard?

419
00:23:16,447 --> 00:23:19,455
Not owning up to it is
worse than not going.

420
00:23:19,455 --> 00:23:22,205
(blows thudding)

421
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,983
- Wow, intense.

422
00:23:31,896 --> 00:23:33,063
- You wanna try?

423
00:23:34,095 --> 00:23:36,810
- No, no, I don't, I
don't, I don't think so.

424
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:38,345
- Come on.

425
00:23:38,345 --> 00:23:41,262
(soft tense music)

426
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:43,463
Put these on.

427
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:45,993
(Velcro crunching)
This one.

428
00:23:45,993 --> 00:23:46,826
- Okay.

429
00:23:51,483 --> 00:23:53,638
I, I don't think they fit actually.

430
00:23:53,638 --> 00:23:56,449
- I think they do, other hand.

431
00:23:56,449 --> 00:23:59,220
(Velcro crunching)

432
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,053
Halloween.

433
00:24:04,029 --> 00:24:07,710
All right, first we're gonna
get you in your fighter stance.

434
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:10,226
All right, what are you,
right-handed, left-handed?

435
00:24:10,226 --> 00:24:11,160
- Right-handed.

436
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,860
- Okay, so put your right
leg back, put your hands up.

437
00:24:14,776 --> 00:24:16,893
Guard your chin, tuck your elbows.

438
00:24:17,985 --> 00:24:18,843
There you go.

439
00:24:20,343 --> 00:24:22,113
That's your fighter stance.

440
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:25,080
- I feel that.
- All right.

441
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,980
- Okay.

442
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,280
- Give it a shot.
- Okay.

443
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,302
(soft tense music)

444
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:30,240
(blow thudding lightly)

445
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,893
Oh. (laughing)
- Try again.

446
00:24:35,276 --> 00:24:37,042
(blow thudding lightly)

447
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,940
Common mistake.

448
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:42,786
You don't push the bag, you hit the bag.

449
00:24:42,786 --> 00:24:45,933
All right, use your weight and
extend your arm all the way.

450
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:48,213
- Okay.
- Go again.

451
00:24:51,314 --> 00:24:53,814
(blows thudding lightly)

452
00:24:53,814 --> 00:24:55,233
(Alex groaning)
Better.

453
00:24:56,455 --> 00:24:59,970
(blow thudding lightly)

454
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:00,886
Go again.

455
00:25:00,886 --> 00:25:02,233
(phone ringing)
- Oh.

456
00:25:02,233 --> 00:25:06,027
My bad.
(Velcro crunching)

457
00:25:07,637 --> 00:25:12,478
- [Gracie] Did your fantasy
man arrive? (laughing)

458
00:25:12,478 --> 00:25:13,863
- Hello, Gracie.
- Sorry.

459
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,110
Hi, Shane.

460
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,310
- Gracie, we're in the
middle of something,

461
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:19,020
Alex will call you back.

462
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,570
- [Gracie] Alex, I need one
more painting for my show

463
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:23,692
and I can't decide if-
- Ah, GJ,

464
00:25:23,692 --> 00:25:25,410
I'm gonna call you back.

465
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:27,906
- [Gracie] Fine, whatever.

466
00:25:27,906 --> 00:25:28,739
- Okay.

467
00:25:29,642 --> 00:25:32,433
- When we're here,
don't answer your phone.

468
00:25:33,651 --> 00:25:34,653
Be present.

469
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:39,273
- Okay, all right, I
didn't know the rules.

470
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,263
- Now you do.

471
00:25:42,263 --> 00:25:44,550
(soft tense music)

472
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,933
- I'll go again.
- Good.

473
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,533
- Okay.

474
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:54,750
(blows thudding lightly)

475
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,714
- There you go, Alex.

476
00:25:56,714 --> 00:25:59,130
(blows thudding lightly)

477
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,803
Okay, okay.

478
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:02,933
- Okay.

479
00:26:04,442 --> 00:26:06,393
- Don't worry, it takes practice.

480
00:26:08,182 --> 00:26:10,203
We'll make a fighter out of you yet.

481
00:26:11,143 --> 00:26:13,863
(melodic rock music)
(blows thudding)

482
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:16,032
All right, rotate more.

483
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:18,782
(blows thudding)

484
00:26:21,174 --> 00:26:23,644
Not bad.

485
00:26:23,644 --> 00:26:26,984
Not bad, but remember, the
other guy's not stopping.

486
00:26:26,984 --> 00:26:28,788
What are you gonna do?

487
00:26:28,788 --> 00:26:30,704
- Ask for time out.

488
00:26:30,704 --> 00:26:33,573
- All right, smart ass, 45 more seconds,

489
00:26:33,573 --> 00:26:35,583
then we'll take a break 'til tonight.

490
00:26:37,576 --> 00:26:39,205
(blows thudding)
(Alex breathing heavily)

491
00:26:39,205 --> 00:26:40,038
Go on.

492
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:42,308
There you go.

493
00:26:43,236 --> 00:26:46,319
(soft melodic music)

494
00:26:49,366 --> 00:26:52,033
(door thudding)

495
00:26:59,271 --> 00:27:04,271
(phone ringing)
(Alex groaning)

496
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:24,174
(Alex groaning)

497
00:27:25,217 --> 00:27:27,634
- Hope that was your last 10?

498
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,013
- Sadly, no. (breathing heavily)

499
00:27:32,013 --> 00:27:32,863
- [Shane] Get up.

500
00:27:35,421 --> 00:27:37,103
- [Alex] What are you doing?

501
00:27:37,103 --> 00:27:38,313
- Give me your hand.

502
00:27:40,797 --> 00:27:42,340
- Where were you?

503
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,713
- Don't worry about it.

504
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:48,562
One thing I notice about you,
Alex, you have pent up anger,

505
00:27:48,562 --> 00:27:51,010
you learn to control
that or it controls you.

506
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,179
- What makes you think I'm angry?

507
00:27:53,179 --> 00:27:54,877
- Why, do you think you hide it?

508
00:27:54,877 --> 00:27:56,490
- [Alex] I'm supposed to be meditating,

509
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:58,134
Veronica says-
- That's not gonna help.

510
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:01,557
- Well, what about Paul
McCartney, Madonna, Oprah?

511
00:28:01,557 --> 00:28:03,450
I mean, a lot of-
- If you wanna sit there

512
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:06,202
and listen to yourself breathe, go for it.

513
00:28:06,202 --> 00:28:09,084
But that comes after you
fight for what you want.

514
00:28:09,084 --> 00:28:10,833
Punch hard, don't stop.

515
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:15,583
Go.

516
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:16,655
(blows thudding)

517
00:28:16,655 --> 00:28:20,310
Why do you let your little
girlfriend Gracie run your life?

518
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,143
Don't stop.

519
00:28:21,143 --> 00:28:23,043
- She's just looking out for me.

520
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,607
- No, she's trying to control you,

521
00:28:25,607 --> 00:28:27,510
'cause you're her little fixer upper.

522
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:29,311
- She's a good friend, okay.

523
00:28:29,311 --> 00:28:31,486
- She's just sorry for you, Alex,

524
00:28:31,486 --> 00:28:33,998
but you don't mind, you
like the companionship

525
00:28:33,998 --> 00:28:35,737
and you don't wanna be alone.

526
00:28:35,737 --> 00:28:36,745
(blow thudding)

527
00:28:36,745 --> 00:28:38,753
- I don't wanna do this with you, okay.

528
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:41,673
- Alex.

529
00:28:41,673 --> 00:28:44,010
I'm trying to help you.
- Help what?

530
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:44,990
No, I'm fine.

531
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,246
- You're fine?
- Yeah.

532
00:28:46,246 --> 00:28:50,010
- You dream about guys, you
dream about songwriting,

533
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:53,103
but all you do is dream,
you never do anything.

534
00:28:54,685 --> 00:28:58,593
You know what, it's your
life, spend it how you want.

535
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,033
- Hey,

536
00:29:04,704 --> 00:29:05,883
you're not wrong.

537
00:29:09,653 --> 00:29:11,943
- Do you wanna know why I train?

538
00:29:16,462 --> 00:29:19,428
(soft melodic music)

539
00:29:19,428 --> 00:29:23,403
You're in the mirror, you're
forced to face yourself.

540
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:28,143
No lies, no excuses.

541
00:29:30,547 --> 00:29:32,613
Look hard at yourself, Alex,

542
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,363
you wanna know what I see?

543
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,053
Fear.

544
00:29:40,259 --> 00:29:41,973
Something happened to you.

545
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,190
- What if it did?

546
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,960
- The past is the past, Alex,

547
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,030
do something about it and you move on.

548
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:53,790
- It's not that easy and you
don't know everything, okay.

549
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,380
- I know you're afraid of sex.

550
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,310
- What?

551
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,960
- Intimacy?

552
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,973
- I-I've never been comfortable with it.

553
00:30:01,042 --> 00:30:02,641
(soft tense music)

554
00:30:02,641 --> 00:30:04,380
- Do you want me to show you?

555
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,213
- [Alex] What?

556
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:08,373
- I've seen the way you look at me.

557
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,070
- Oh, if you're going
off what Gracie said.

558
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,363
- Don't lie to me, Alex.

559
00:30:18,382 --> 00:30:20,103
- I'm-I'm embarrassed, okay.

560
00:30:21,858 --> 00:30:25,293
- Don't ever be embarrassed
of wanting somebody,

561
00:30:27,481 --> 00:30:29,043
being honest about it.

562
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,510
- I freeze up or I don't,
I don't know what to do

563
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,930
around guys, I-I.

564
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:36,543
- Do you want my help?

565
00:30:37,737 --> 00:30:39,408
- I don't know.

566
00:30:39,408 --> 00:30:41,493
- This has got to come from you, Alex.

567
00:30:43,024 --> 00:30:45,183
- [Alex] You mean with sex stuff?

568
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:47,973
- With anything you want.

569
00:30:49,186 --> 00:30:52,924
(soft tense music)

570
00:30:52,924 --> 00:30:54,783
If you want my help, Alex,

571
00:30:58,830 --> 00:30:59,663
say it.

572
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:05,449
- I, I want your help.

573
00:31:05,449 --> 00:31:08,366
(soft tense music)

574
00:31:19,354 --> 00:31:21,370
- You're trembling.

575
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:23,926
- I'm sorry, I'm-I'm a little nervous.

576
00:31:23,926 --> 00:31:26,509
- [Shane] You don't need to be.

577
00:31:35,417 --> 00:31:36,250
- Ow!

578
00:31:38,341 --> 00:31:41,071
- That keeps you present,

579
00:31:41,071 --> 00:31:44,611
you don't think about anything else.

580
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,106
- Okay.

581
00:31:46,106 --> 00:31:49,023
(soft tense music)

582
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:10,360
- Try to get up.

583
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,019
- Like, like wrestle you?

584
00:32:12,019 --> 00:32:13,533
- Try to take control.

585
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:18,480
(soft tense music)

586
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,846
Try harder.

587
00:32:19,846 --> 00:32:21,272
- I can't, you're too strong.

588
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,105
- Stop making excuses.

589
00:32:25,893 --> 00:32:27,280
Come on.

590
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,197
(soft tense music)

591
00:32:35,897 --> 00:32:37,147
Ready for more?

592
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,227
Someone's getting excited.

593
00:32:46,396 --> 00:32:49,313
(soft tense music)

594
00:32:57,496 --> 00:32:59,075
(Alex coughing)

595
00:32:59,075 --> 00:33:02,773
(hand slapping)
Fight, come on.

596
00:33:02,773 --> 00:33:04,023
Come on, fight.

597
00:33:05,936 --> 00:33:07,951
(soft tense music)

598
00:33:07,951 --> 00:33:10,226
Come on.
(Alex choking)

599
00:33:10,226 --> 00:33:11,476
Fight me, Alex.

600
00:33:13,895 --> 00:33:17,562
- What the fuck, man,
you trying to kill me?

601
00:33:21,115 --> 00:33:24,115
(upbeat rock music)

602
00:33:29,326 --> 00:33:34,326
(blows thudding)
(upbeat rock music)

603
00:33:53,725 --> 00:33:56,725
(upbeat rock music)

604
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,710
- I showed up drunk to my son,

605
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:13,203
Ethan's high school talent show,

606
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:16,443
not even sure how I got there.

607
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:22,170
After the show, Ethan
wouldn't speak to me.

608
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:24,880
He grabbed the car keys out of my hand

609
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,663
and he drove us home.

610
00:34:28,928 --> 00:34:30,453
He was 16.

611
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:35,910
On our way home, we were
hit by a drunk driver

612
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:37,953
on his side of the car.

613
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:43,932
That shouldn't have happened,

614
00:34:43,932 --> 00:34:46,743
he had his whole life in front of him,

615
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,523
but because of me, it was cut short.

616
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:55,110
After that, my life fell apart.

617
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:57,213
Soon after, I went to a meeting,

618
00:34:58,307 --> 00:35:01,490
after the meeting, a woman walked up to me

619
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:03,610
and she asked what was wrong

620
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:08,733
and I told her and she said,

621
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:14,523
I'm not responsible for
my disease of alcoholism,

622
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:20,193
but I am responsible for my recovery.

623
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:26,390
I think about my Ethan
every single day, (sobbing)

624
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:34,180
my living amends to my son

625
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:37,674
is my sobriety

626
00:35:37,674 --> 00:35:39,610
and I would like to think

627
00:35:40,959 --> 00:35:41,920
that Ethan

628
00:35:44,084 --> 00:35:47,193
would be proud of the
woman that I am today.

629
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,245
Thank you for letting me share.

630
00:35:52,245 --> 00:35:55,162
(group applauding)

631
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:04,083
- Thank you for sharing
so honestly, Veronica.

632
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,120
We like to celebrate
milestones at this meeting

633
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:13,590
for every 365 days of continuous sobriety.

634
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:15,753
Tonight, we have one birthday,

635
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,000
Alex for one year

636
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:23,521
and for that, Gracie and
Veronica will give you your cake.

637
00:36:23,521 --> 00:36:24,870
(group applauding)

638
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,529
Come on.

639
00:36:26,529 --> 00:36:35,279
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

640
00:36:35,279 --> 00:36:40,279
♪ Happy birthday, dear Alex ♪

641
00:36:40,471 --> 00:36:44,962

642
00:36:44,962 --> 00:36:47,879

643
00:36:49,544 --> 00:36:50,998
(Veronica laughing)

644
00:36:50,998 --> 00:36:53,915
(group applauding)

645
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:07,522
- [Alex] Hi, I'm Alex, I'm an alcoholic.

646
00:37:07,522 --> 00:37:08,998
- [All] Hi, Alex.

647
00:37:08,998 --> 00:37:10,170
(Veronica laughing)

648
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:12,498
- I'm serious.

649
00:37:12,498 --> 00:37:13,420
I'm serious.

650
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:16,420
(Veronica laughing)

651
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,673
- Brent?

652
00:37:20,765 --> 00:37:23,013
- Yeah, I think I got a shot.

653
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:27,170
- So if someone like
Brent or Shane likes you,

654
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:29,243
that's enough for validation?

655
00:37:29,243 --> 00:37:31,383
- Is wanting to be liked a bad thing?

656
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:35,975
- God loves you, honey,
that's why we have God,

657
00:37:35,975 --> 00:37:38,100
because people won't always be around.

658
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,206
- Come on, Ronnie, don't
you ever get lonely?

659
00:37:40,206 --> 00:37:42,039
- (laughing) Do I get lonely?

660
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:47,039
But with God, I'm not alone,
that's the difference.

661
00:37:49,428 --> 00:37:50,457
- Hey, you two.

662
00:37:50,457 --> 00:37:52,440
- Listen, thanks for sticking
around for my one year.

663
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,650
- You know I wouldn't miss
it, but we do have to go,

664
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:57,720
so I just wanna say congratulations

665
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,510
and sorry about your dad.
- Thanks.

666
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:03,526
Hey, listen, if you, ah, if
you wanna take in a meeting

667
00:38:03,526 --> 00:38:06,390
or like, like dinner or something?

668
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:09,630
- Yeah, I'll text you
tomorrow, that was good.

669
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:12,102
- Yeah.
- Good seeing you, Brent.

670
00:38:12,102 --> 00:38:13,241
- Bye, Brent.

671
00:38:13,241 --> 00:38:15,210
(hand patting)
(Gracie laughing)

672
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,830
Did you just ask him out?

673
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:17,663
- Sort of.

674
00:38:17,663 --> 00:38:18,496
- Not really. (laughing)

675
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:20,493
- Mm-hm, yeah, it sounds about right.

676
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,855
- GJ.
- Yeah.

677
00:38:24,855 --> 00:38:27,757
- You think I like, I'm
gonna like hold you back

678
00:38:27,757 --> 00:38:29,490
from like meeting people or something?

679
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:31,867
- What?
- I don't know.

680
00:38:31,867 --> 00:38:33,475
- Where did that come from?

681
00:38:33,475 --> 00:38:35,470
- [Alex] I just don't wanna hold you back.

682
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:37,143
- Can I talk to Alex for a sec?

683
00:38:39,228 --> 00:38:41,220
(clears throat) Hello.

684
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:44,340
- Ah, Gracie, why don't
you help me clean up?

685
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,173
- Sure,

686
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:48,990
sure and we will finish this later.

687
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:49,823
- Okay.

688
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:58,595
- [Shane] Isn't that the
guy you told me about?

689
00:38:58,595 --> 00:39:00,843
- [Alex] Brent, yeah.

690
00:39:00,843 --> 00:39:02,850
- You just stood here and watched.

691
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:04,620
- [Alex] What am I supposed to do?

692
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,850
- Tell him not to leave.

693
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:07,285
- Then what?
- Anything.

694
00:39:07,285 --> 00:39:09,360
Tell him you wanna wrestle
for top, I don't care.

695
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,790
- Come on, if I said that,
he would laugh in my face.

696
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,027
- Why do you think that?

697
00:39:13,027 --> 00:39:14,273
- Because I'm not you.

698
00:39:14,273 --> 00:39:17,430
I don't look like you, I
don't talk like you, come on.

699
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,263
Why do you care?

700
00:39:18,263 --> 00:39:20,523
- Alex, you take your shot.

701
00:39:21,644 --> 00:39:24,393
You don't let anyone steal
that shot away from you.

702
00:39:26,316 --> 00:39:28,623
That's the main difference
between you and me,

703
00:39:30,363 --> 00:39:32,113
(soft tense music)
I'm not afraid.

704
00:39:35,655 --> 00:39:39,048
- I don't wanna be afraid anymore.

705
00:39:39,048 --> 00:39:41,963
- You act strong, you feel strong.

706
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:44,200
You act weak, you feel weak.

707
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,782
- Shane, this looks heavy.

708
00:39:45,782 --> 00:39:47,613
- This isn't about lifting weights.

709
00:39:48,676 --> 00:39:50,700
This is about whether or
not you have the strength

710
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,350
to step out of your comfort zone.

711
00:39:53,479 --> 00:39:56,142
You've been comfortable
for too long, Alex.

712
00:39:56,142 --> 00:39:58,143
- How do you know me so well?

713
00:40:00,897 --> 00:40:02,972
- I used to be you.

714
00:40:02,972 --> 00:40:04,899
Now let's do this.

715
00:40:04,899 --> 00:40:08,232
(background rock music)

716
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,273
- Here?
- Yep, there.

717
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,967
(metal clanking)
- Argh!

718
00:40:24,967 --> 00:40:25,906
Fuck!
- Push.

719
00:40:25,906 --> 00:40:26,910
- I am!

720
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:29,070
- I'm not helping you.
- I know.

721
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:30,570
- Get angry.

722
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:31,740
- Trying.

723
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,906
- Push it.

724
00:40:32,906 --> 00:40:34,260
(Alex groaning)
Come on, Alex.

725
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,000
Alex, think of a time you were so angry,

726
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,800
you wanted to put your
fist through a wall,

727
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,000
tap into that right now.

728
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,183
- Ah, motherfuck, argh!
- Push!

729
00:40:42,055 --> 00:40:43,890
(metal clanking)
- Ah!

730
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:44,723
Fuck!

731
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:47,813
Shit.

732
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:52,072
- Good job, you did good.

733
00:40:53,101 --> 00:40:56,360
(phone ringing)

734
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,675
- Sorry, it's my boss,

735
00:40:57,675 --> 00:40:59,730
probably gonna tell me off for some shit.

736
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:01,170
- Quit.

737
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:02,003
- What?
(phone ringing)

738
00:41:02,003 --> 00:41:04,410
- People like your boss get away with it,

739
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:06,360
because people like you put up with it.

740
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:09,143
- Hey, Jack.

741
00:41:09,143 --> 00:41:10,770
- [Jack] Hey, Alex, glad I got you.

742
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:13,260
You're working Sunday, starting next week

743
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:16,186
and it's a busy day, so no fuck ups.

744
00:41:16,186 --> 00:41:19,103
(soft tense music)

745
00:41:20,342 --> 00:41:22,380
- Jack, you can't talk
to me like that, man.

746
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,843
- [Jack] Stop fucking up and I won't.

747
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,650
- Yo, I quit, how about that?

748
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:29,860
- [Jack] You're making
a big mistake, Alex.

749
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,131
- Yeah, go fuck yourself, jag off.

750
00:41:32,131 --> 00:41:35,048
(phone clattering)

751
00:41:36,571 --> 00:41:37,833
- Feels good, doesn't it?

752
00:41:41,652 --> 00:41:43,114
- Yeah.

753
00:41:43,114 --> 00:41:46,197
(soft melodic music)

754
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,033
- Do you have that guy's number?

755
00:41:55,182 --> 00:41:56,015
- Who, Brent?

756
00:41:56,015 --> 00:41:57,810
- I don't know, the guy
that you were talking to

757
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:59,973
at your party.
- Brent, yeah.

758
00:41:59,973 --> 00:42:02,902
- I want you to invite him
to one of your meetings,

759
00:42:02,902 --> 00:42:06,725
then when you see him, you
tell him you're taking him out.

760
00:42:06,725 --> 00:42:08,975
You don't ask him over
the phone, you got it?

761
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,000
- Yeah.

762
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:12,833
- Good.

763
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:22,020
Tell me, Alex, how did
you choose your sponsor?

764
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:22,853
- Veronica?

765
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,380
She was a, a speaker at
one of my first meetings.

766
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:30,033
I don't know, I just, I liked
her, she was kind to me.

767
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:31,943
Why?

768
00:42:31,943 --> 00:42:33,633
- Because she's not like you.

769
00:42:34,938 --> 00:42:39,330
You were abused and you
couldn't deal with your anger

770
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:41,253
because of that, so you drank.

771
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:44,820
- Yeah, I guess.

772
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:49,530
- And sex sucks, because you're
afraid of men thanks to Dad,

773
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:50,969
am I right?

774
00:42:50,969 --> 00:42:53,573
- What does this have to do with Ronnie?

775
00:42:53,573 --> 00:42:55,743
- She enables your fear of men.

776
00:42:58,384 --> 00:43:00,843
- She's a good sponsor, okay.

777
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:06,143
- Maybe.

778
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,583
- Look, Gracie's gonna be here
soon, so I gotta get dressed.

779
00:43:11,583 --> 00:43:12,963
Thanks for the shake.

780
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:19,697
(door thudding)

781
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:21,780
(Braden knocking)

782
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:22,613
- I'll get it.

783
00:43:23,466 --> 00:43:26,216
(shower running)

784
00:43:29,121 --> 00:43:31,954
(Braden knocking)

785
00:43:34,565 --> 00:43:36,810
(door clicking)

786
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:38,611
Can I help you?

787
00:43:38,611 --> 00:43:41,250
- Detective Cole, Slowsburgh County,

788
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:42,723
looking for Alex Romero.

789
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,352
- Alex isn't here right now.

790
00:43:45,352 --> 00:43:47,320
Anything that I can help you with?

791
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,380
- [Braden] You live here?

792
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:53,147
- Yeah, I'm his new roommate,
I just moved in recently.

793
00:43:53,147 --> 00:43:55,260
- Just had some questions to ask

794
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,600
about the murder of his father.

795
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,433
- Murder?

796
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,278
Here?

797
00:44:01,278 --> 00:44:02,193
- [Braden] Yeah.

798
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:04,523
- Wow.

799
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,196
I, I had no idea.

800
00:44:07,196 --> 00:44:09,780
- Do you know when Alex will be back?

801
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,543
- Sorry, I, I don't,
he left with a friend.

802
00:44:13,654 --> 00:44:16,140
- Okay, well, just tell
him that I was here.

803
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:17,160
He has my number.

804
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,000
- Of course, yeah.

805
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,273
- I hope I didn't give
you any cause for concern.

806
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:26,943
- I'm not worried, but I'll
keep my eyes open for you.

807
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,447
- Sure, right.

808
00:44:30,447 --> 00:44:31,443
Appreciate it.

809
00:44:37,471 --> 00:44:40,138
(door thudding)

810
00:44:41,404 --> 00:44:42,433
- Who was it?

811
00:44:43,904 --> 00:44:47,010
- I was reading that recovery
book you all subscribe to.

812
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:50,272
- Ah, big book.

813
00:44:50,272 --> 00:44:52,313
Who was at the door?

814
00:44:52,313 --> 00:44:54,363
- It says a lot about being honest,

815
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:58,713
rigorously honest, I think it says.

816
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:01,743
- Yeah, so?

817
00:45:03,086 --> 00:45:04,803
- So get honest with me, Alex,

818
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:07,523
right now.

819
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:11,913
Or should I ask Detective Cole?

820
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:15,623
- Shane.

821
00:45:16,831 --> 00:45:19,953
I'm, I'm sorry, I should've told you.

822
00:45:21,086 --> 00:45:23,730
- And Veronica knew about this?

823
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:24,563
- Yeah.

824
00:45:26,383 --> 00:45:27,828
- And Gracie?
- Yeah.

825
00:45:27,828 --> 00:45:30,060
Look, they wanted me
to tell you the truth,

826
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,003
but I, I didn't wanna lose you.

827
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,593
Come on, don't do this,
Shane, say something.

828
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:43,983
Do something.

829
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,079
Hit me.

830
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:50,603
Come on, hit me, I deserve
it, hit me, go ahead.

831
00:45:52,111 --> 00:45:55,361
(Alex gasping sharply)

832
00:45:58,468 --> 00:46:00,753
- I'm the only honest person in your life.

833
00:46:11,367 --> 00:46:14,034
(door thudding)

834
00:46:21,371 --> 00:46:23,340
- (sighing) I hate to say I told you so,

835
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:24,930
but you should have told him.

836
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:27,540
- I get it, now what's the
deal with tomorrow night again?

837
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:28,980
- The gallery closes at eight,

838
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:31,680
we reopen for the show at
nine and it's over at 10,

839
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,600
so you don't have to worry
about it being all night.

840
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,264
- Who said I was worried?

841
00:46:35,264 --> 00:46:36,303
- Huh?

842
00:46:37,208 --> 00:46:38,940
My boss's husband is coming

843
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:40,950
and I want you to make a good impression.

844
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:42,293
- Should I get a tux?
(soft guitar music)

845
00:46:42,293 --> 00:46:46,287
- (laughing) No, I know
you've got something in here.

846
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:52,440
Yeah, yeah, a button down and jeans,

847
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:55,107
that look like you didn't
run over them is enough.

848
00:46:55,107 --> 00:46:57,156
You really need a music manager, Alex.

849
00:46:57,156 --> 00:46:58,677
- You're too good to me.

850
00:46:58,677 --> 00:47:01,470
- But I know, but I
want this for you, okay.

851
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:03,063
So this,

852
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:07,290
these and this,

853
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:09,783
only, nothing else, okay, I gotta go.

854
00:47:10,944 --> 00:47:12,063
- Give me a kiss.

855
00:47:13,554 --> 00:47:14,954
- Love you.
- Love you too.

856
00:47:16,172 --> 00:47:19,483
(soft tense music)

857
00:47:19,483 --> 00:47:20,483
- Hi, Shane.

858
00:47:24,488 --> 00:47:25,405
Bye, Shane.

859
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:31,133
- [Alex] What?

860
00:47:31,133 --> 00:47:33,727
- She's picking out your clothes now?

861
00:47:33,727 --> 00:47:35,809
What, is she gonna dress you too?

862
00:47:35,809 --> 00:47:37,859
- Do we have to do this right now, Shane?

863
00:47:39,071 --> 00:47:41,002
Look, Shane, I'm sorry that I lied to you.

864
00:47:41,002 --> 00:47:42,105
(hand slapping)

865
00:47:42,105 --> 00:47:43,903
(soft tense music)

866
00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:44,736
Stop.

867
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:47,268
- (hand slapping) Do
something about it, Alex.

868
00:47:47,268 --> 00:47:48,922
(hand slapping) Come on, Alex.

869
00:47:48,922 --> 00:47:50,233
(hand slapping) Fight me.

870
00:47:50,233 --> 00:47:53,142
- I don't feel like-
(hand slapping)

871
00:47:53,142 --> 00:47:54,273
- What if I do?

872
00:47:55,285 --> 00:47:57,333
What if I was the guy who broke in here?

873
00:47:58,656 --> 00:48:00,543
What if I was gonna hurt you?

874
00:48:02,841 --> 00:48:05,260
Would you whine like a little bitch?

875
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:07,299
Think that would help?

876
00:48:07,299 --> 00:48:09,063
- Why you doing this?

877
00:48:10,902 --> 00:48:13,323
- Because the world isn't nice, Alex.

878
00:48:15,868 --> 00:48:17,583
You wanted honesty, right?

879
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:20,883
Courage to change.

880
00:48:23,524 --> 00:48:26,607
(soft melodic music)

881
00:48:33,626 --> 00:48:36,870
- [All] The courage to
change the things we can

882
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:39,190
and the wisdom to know the difference.

883
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:41,261
- Thank you all, have a good night.

884
00:48:41,261 --> 00:48:43,261
- Goodnight.
- Thank you.

885
00:48:44,371 --> 00:48:46,554
Thank you, drive safe please.

886
00:48:46,554 --> 00:48:48,054
Have a good night.

887
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:49,843
- Hey.
- Oh, hi, what's up?

888
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:51,343
- What's going on?

889
00:48:51,343 --> 00:48:53,610
Feel like grabbing dinner?

890
00:48:53,610 --> 00:48:55,983
- Ah, right now?
- Sure, why not?

891
00:48:57,150 --> 00:48:59,130
- Yeah, sure, let's do it.

892
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:00,081
- I'll drive.

893
00:49:00,081 --> 00:49:02,831
(Shane knocking)

894
00:49:16,048 --> 00:49:17,506
(Dale clears throat)

895
00:49:17,506 --> 00:49:19,830
(door clicking)

896
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:21,600
- [Dale] Hi, Peter?

897
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,103
- Yeah, Dale?

898
00:49:28,443 --> 00:49:30,462
(glass clinking)
(alcohol pouring)

899
00:49:30,462 --> 00:49:34,212
(background classical music)

900
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:41,783
- Wow.

901
00:49:43,195 --> 00:49:44,743
Um, you look great.

902
00:49:44,743 --> 00:49:46,170
(both laughing)

903
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:47,100
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

904
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:51,060
Um, I-I, I was a little afraid, you know,

905
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:52,600
faceless pic and all.

906
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:56,679
- The internet and faces
these days, you get it.

907
00:49:56,679 --> 00:49:58,980
- Oh, do you want a drink?

908
00:49:58,980 --> 00:49:59,813
- No, thanks.

909
00:49:59,813 --> 00:50:02,250
- [Dale] You mind if I have one?

910
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:03,100
- Yeah, go ahead.

911
00:50:03,972 --> 00:50:05,952
(glass clinking)

912
00:50:05,952 --> 00:50:07,296
First time jitters?

913
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:09,540
(Dale laughing nervously)

914
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,343
- [Dale] Yeah, is it that obvious?

915
00:50:12,196 --> 00:50:13,593
- Don't worry about it.

916
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:18,090
- Thanks.
(ice cubes clanking)

917
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:21,750
I just um, wasn't too
sure how this all works.

918
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:23,057
Do we, um?

919
00:50:23,057 --> 00:50:26,376
- We can just talk, while
you have your drink,

920
00:50:26,376 --> 00:50:28,868
give you a chance to relax.

921
00:50:28,868 --> 00:50:30,483
- [Dale] Sounds good to me.

922
00:50:31,513 --> 00:50:35,263
(background classical music)

923
00:50:41,878 --> 00:50:43,350
- Nice fire you have going here.

924
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:44,183
- Hm.

925
00:50:52,763 --> 00:50:54,723
So what do we talk about?

926
00:50:56,907 --> 00:50:58,743
- Tell me about yourself.

927
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,383
- [Dale] Ah, like what?

928
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,923
- Well, you like Shakespeare?

929
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:09,693
- Um, (laughing) yeah,

930
00:51:11,064 --> 00:51:13,113
"The Tempest" is a favorite.

931
00:51:14,587 --> 00:51:15,537
- "Tempest?"

932
00:51:16,542 --> 00:51:18,543
What made you find me?

933
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:21,933
- Well, um,

934
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:29,913
I haven't been with anyone in a while.

935
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:38,610
- Must be difficult to meet people,

936
00:51:38,610 --> 00:51:40,460
when you're on the Sex Offender List.

937
00:51:45,797 --> 00:51:47,612
- You know about that?

938
00:51:47,612 --> 00:51:50,412
- I check every address I go to.

939
00:51:50,412 --> 00:51:52,554
I should, shouldn't I?

940
00:51:52,554 --> 00:51:54,033
- Oh, absolutely.

941
00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:56,539
- Yeah.

942
00:51:56,539 --> 00:52:00,843
I did some digging online, I
couldn't believe what I found.

943
00:52:02,887 --> 00:52:04,833
- That was a long time ago.

944
00:52:05,681 --> 00:52:07,443
- Johnny Owens was a minor.

945
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:15,483
- I, I, I swear, I thought he was 18.

946
00:52:16,486 --> 00:52:17,883
- How'd you do it?

947
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,293
How'd you lure him in?

948
00:52:23,356 --> 00:52:27,693
Did you build a little
fire, offer him a drink?

949
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,878
- Listen, that's not who I am anymore.

950
00:52:32,878 --> 00:52:34,383
I've recovered from that.

951
00:52:35,356 --> 00:52:38,145
- Do you think Johnny recovered?

952
00:52:38,145 --> 00:52:41,193
- Listen, if you don't mind,
I'd rather not talk about this.

953
00:52:42,243 --> 00:52:45,003
- You're right, it's cool.

954
00:52:51,048 --> 00:52:52,650
I don't mind.

955
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:53,483
- Good.

956
00:52:55,138 --> 00:52:56,763
- The thing is, Dale,

957
00:52:58,703 --> 00:53:00,835
Johnny minds.

958
00:53:00,835 --> 00:53:02,970
(blow thudding)
- Oh!

959
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:05,605
Oh, oh.
- Johnny minds a lot, Dale!

960
00:53:05,605 --> 00:53:10,605
- Oh, my God. (groaning)

961
00:53:13,804 --> 00:53:15,310
Ah, ow!

962
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:18,540
Look, oh God, I know it was
wrong, I know it was wrong.

963
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:21,651
I was sick, I needed
help, I was abused too.

964
00:53:21,651 --> 00:53:23,823
- Then you should've known better.

965
00:53:24,658 --> 00:53:27,240
What do you see when you
look in the mirror, Dale?

966
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,657
- I don't know, please, please, please,

967
00:53:29,657 --> 00:53:31,950
I'll do anything you want, please.

968
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:33,720
If it's money, I have money, please.

969
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:34,553
- Money?

970
00:53:35,397 --> 00:53:40,397
(Dale thudding to floor)
(Dale groaning)

971
00:53:40,477 --> 00:53:42,217
- Don't, please.

972
00:53:42,217 --> 00:53:45,967
(background classical music)

973
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:51,047
- "He that dies pays all debts."

974
00:53:52,556 --> 00:53:53,990
(Dale shrieking)

975
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:58,990
(poker thudding)
(melodic classical music)

976
00:54:08,037 --> 00:54:10,677
(Shane breathing heavily)

977
00:54:10,677 --> 00:54:14,177
(melodic classical music)

978
00:54:20,642 --> 00:54:25,642
(shower running)
(tense melodic music)

979
00:55:10,092 --> 00:55:13,842
(background classical music)

980
00:55:29,723 --> 00:55:32,180
(door clicking)

981
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:33,360
(door thudding)

982
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,936
- I hated my first year,

983
00:55:34,936 --> 00:55:39,506
the sponsor said no dating, that sucked.

984
00:55:39,506 --> 00:55:41,891
- Mine said the same thing, but you know,

985
00:55:41,891 --> 00:55:43,367
it's all right now.

986
00:55:43,367 --> 00:55:44,200
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

987
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,733
- Well, now that you're past a year sober,

988
00:55:46,733 --> 00:55:48,840
got your eyes on anybody
you wanna ask out?

989
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:49,673
- Sure.

990
00:55:50,561 --> 00:55:53,155
We're here, aren't we?

991
00:55:53,155 --> 00:55:54,264
- You mean me?

992
00:55:54,264 --> 00:55:57,018
- Yeah, I mean you, I'm looking at you.

993
00:55:57,018 --> 00:55:59,959
What, didn't you know this was a date?

994
00:55:59,959 --> 00:56:01,653
- I mean, I thought you were into me,

995
00:56:01,653 --> 00:56:03,120
but I didn't think it
was like a date date.

996
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:05,276
- You thought I was
into you, but you just,

997
00:56:05,276 --> 00:56:06,960
you decided to come for the attention?

998
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,186
- Ah, I don't know about that.

999
00:56:09,186 --> 00:56:11,673
We're guys, we flirt, that's what we do.

1000
00:56:12,898 --> 00:56:15,153
- Brent, you're totally leading me on.

1001
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:19,290
- No, I'm being nice to you
'cause you're a newcomer.

1002
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:21,420
- Bullshit, bullshit!

1003
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:24,090
No, no, come on, you
fucking owe me this date.

1004
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:26,537
- Ooh, no, I don't owe you this date.

1005
00:56:26,537 --> 00:56:29,730
I don't owe you anything, no one does.

1006
00:56:29,730 --> 00:56:32,763
- Okay, oh what, we're
gonna go there with it?

1007
00:56:32,763 --> 00:56:33,857
What an asshole!

1008
00:56:33,857 --> 00:56:35,670
- Okay, let's just dial it back.

1009
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:36,843
- Oh, fuck you.

1010
00:56:38,217 --> 00:56:40,179
No, yeah, yeah, fuck you!

1011
00:56:40,179 --> 00:56:42,010
(glasses clanking)

1012
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:44,886
(background guitar music)

1013
00:56:44,886 --> 00:56:48,803
(background people chattering)

1014
00:56:52,569 --> 00:56:55,236
(hand thudding)

1015
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:15,413
- Oh.

1016
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:18,207
- Who's she?

1017
00:57:18,207 --> 00:57:19,743
- [Kirsty] Who are you?

1018
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:23,553
- Alex, this is Kirsty.

1019
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,113
- Hi.

1020
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,103
- You okay?

1021
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:34,524
- I'm fine.

1022
00:57:34,524 --> 00:57:36,238
- [Kirsty] Don't look it.

1023
00:57:36,238 --> 00:57:38,072
- Don't worry about it.

1024
00:57:38,072 --> 00:57:40,263
- (laughing) Is this about that guy?

1025
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:42,743
- Yeah.

1026
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:45,835
- Did he dump you?

1027
00:57:45,835 --> 00:57:47,403
- Something like that.

1028
00:57:48,838 --> 00:57:51,085
- Remember, it's not about him,

1029
00:57:51,085 --> 00:57:53,784
it was about you taking your shot.

1030
00:57:53,784 --> 00:57:54,933
Now move on.

1031
00:57:55,901 --> 00:57:57,423
- It's not that easy.

1032
00:57:58,345 --> 00:58:00,538
- Don't worry, baby,

1033
00:58:00,538 --> 00:58:03,625
somebody's gonna love
that sweet face of yours.

1034
00:58:03,625 --> 00:58:06,375
(Shane laughing)

1035
00:58:08,116 --> 00:58:09,933
Now if you'll excuse me.

1036
00:58:12,821 --> 00:58:14,670
Don't leave me waiting too long.

1037
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:15,630
- All right.

1038
00:58:15,630 --> 00:58:18,027
(hand patting)

1039
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:20,668
(Shane laughing)

1040
00:58:20,668 --> 00:58:22,353
- Is she one of your clients?

1041
00:58:24,485 --> 00:58:26,193
- Why would you think that?

1042
00:58:27,437 --> 00:58:30,538
- I just thought that you-
- You just thought that?

1043
00:58:30,538 --> 00:58:33,255
(soft tense music)

1044
00:58:33,255 --> 00:58:35,480
You have your little girlfriend.

1045
00:58:41,691 --> 00:58:44,274
(hand patting)

1046
00:58:49,551 --> 00:58:53,218
(Shane and Kirsty laughing)

1047
00:58:56,436 --> 00:58:59,519
(soft melodic music)

1048
00:59:26,125 --> 00:59:28,792
(Alex knocking)

1049
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:34,027
(door clicking)

1050
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:36,523
- Hey.
- Hey.

1051
00:59:36,523 --> 00:59:38,574
- I didn't expect to see you back here.

1052
00:59:38,574 --> 00:59:39,993
- What's up, Randy?

1053
00:59:41,130 --> 00:59:41,963
- What's up?

1054
00:59:42,822 --> 00:59:46,155
(background soft music)

1055
00:59:55,639 --> 00:59:57,213
- [Freddy] Any word yet?

1056
00:59:58,807 --> 01:00:02,282
- No, just starting to
get a little worried.

1057
01:00:02,282 --> 01:00:04,832
- Well, he could still show
up, the night is young.

1058
01:00:09,369 --> 01:00:14,190
Meanwhile, you are so
unbelievably talented.

1059
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:15,483
- Thanks, Freddy.

1060
01:00:18,472 --> 01:00:21,276
- You know, we do tend to
always think the worst.

1061
01:00:21,276 --> 01:00:23,130
I'm sure there's just some dumb reason,

1062
01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:24,570
that he is not here yet.

1063
01:00:24,570 --> 01:00:26,493
- Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

1064
01:00:29,245 --> 01:00:30,078
- Is this okay?

1065
01:00:30,078 --> 01:00:32,070
- Yeah, let's fucking do it.

1066
01:00:32,070 --> 01:00:32,903
- Damn!

1067
01:00:34,495 --> 01:00:37,897
(background melodic music)

1068
01:00:37,897 --> 01:00:38,730
Damn!

1069
01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:39,600
- I take it it'll be a rough one?

1070
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:42,848
- Yeah, what you don't know about me.

1071
01:00:42,848 --> 01:00:44,848
- Like what?
- Like this.

1072
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:50,707
(Randy moaning)

1073
01:00:51,754 --> 01:00:52,587
- Damn.

1074
01:00:52,587 --> 01:00:54,670
- You ready for some more?
- Yeah.

1075
01:00:54,670 --> 01:00:55,670
- Yeah?
- Oh.

1076
01:01:03,164 --> 01:01:08,164
(tense melodic music)
(Randy moaning)

1077
01:01:08,486 --> 01:01:10,995
What the fuck are you doing?

1078
01:01:10,995 --> 01:01:12,553
- Relax.
- What the fuck are you doing?

1079
01:01:12,553 --> 01:01:14,373
- Come on, it's fine.
- No!

1080
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:19,740
I want you to go.
- Randy, I'm sorry,

1081
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:21,090
I thought you liked it, man, it's cool,

1082
01:01:21,090 --> 01:01:23,100
we could, we could do-
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

1083
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:23,970
- Randy.

1084
01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:25,320
- I don't know what you think this is.

1085
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:28,379
- Yo, don't be like that.
- I'm not into that.

1086
01:01:28,379 --> 01:01:31,196
- I-I'm sorry, I was just
trying to impress you.

1087
01:01:31,196 --> 01:01:32,906
Don't be like that.
- Just get out, man.

1088
01:01:32,906 --> 01:01:35,990
- Come on, we could try
again, Randy, don't be like...

1089
01:01:40,789 --> 01:01:43,456
(door thudding)

1090
01:01:44,687 --> 01:01:47,468
(Randy exhaling heavily)

1091
01:01:47,468 --> 01:01:52,468
♪ I thought that's what
you wanted all the time ♪

1092
01:01:52,507 --> 01:01:53,985
(keys jangling)

1093
01:01:53,985 --> 01:01:57,318
(Randy sighing heavily)

1094
01:02:00,397 --> 01:02:05,397
- [Randy] Alex, Alex,
hey, you forgot your keys.

1095
01:02:05,615 --> 01:02:07,868
- Look, Randy, I'm so sorry.

1096
01:02:07,868 --> 01:02:09,540
I'm, I would never hurt you, man,

1097
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:11,670
I just, I wanted you to like me.

1098
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:15,931
- Look, some people are what, into that.

1099
01:02:15,931 --> 01:02:17,700
It's just not my thing, okay.

1100
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:19,170
- I get it, I get it.

1101
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:20,809
Let me just try again, I'll be gentle.

1102
01:02:20,809 --> 01:02:21,870
- I don't know.

1103
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:23,943
- Please, please, look, I'll be gentle.

1104
01:02:46,528 --> 01:02:48,905
- Look at the fairy boys.

1105
01:02:48,905 --> 01:02:51,654
- Come on, man.
- What did you just say?

1106
01:02:51,654 --> 01:02:54,183
- I think you heard me, faggot.

1107
01:02:54,183 --> 01:02:55,980
- You can't talk to us like that.

1108
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:56,813
- Yeah?
- Alex.

1109
01:02:56,813 --> 01:02:57,646
- Step back, Randy.

1110
01:02:57,646 --> 01:03:00,360
Yeah, well, at least I'm
not some fucking closet fuck

1111
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:01,193
getting your rocks up-

1112
01:03:01,193 --> 01:03:02,026
- You trying to start something?

1113
01:03:02,026 --> 01:03:03,900
- Maybe I am, but how
about you blow me first?

1114
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:04,733
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1115
01:03:04,733 --> 01:03:08,175
- Yeah?
(blow thudding)

1116
01:03:08,175 --> 01:03:09,690
(soft tense music)

1117
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:10,950
- Come on.
- Fucking bitch.

1118
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:12,517
- [Alex] Come on.

1119
01:03:12,517 --> 01:03:14,475
(metal bar thudding)

1120
01:03:14,475 --> 01:03:17,370
(Alex thudding to ground)

1121
01:03:17,370 --> 01:03:19,630
- Yeah, yeah, how'd you like that?

1122
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:20,715
(blow thudding)
Huh?

1123
01:03:20,715 --> 01:03:23,238
(blow thudding)
- Oh!

1124
01:03:23,238 --> 01:03:25,376
- [Man] You wanna punch me?

1125
01:03:25,376 --> 01:03:27,060
(blow thudding)
- Uh!

1126
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:27,991
- [Man] Huh?

1127
01:03:27,991 --> 01:03:29,434
(kick thudding)
- Uh!

1128
01:03:29,434 --> 01:03:30,463
- Fuck you!

1129
01:03:30,463 --> 01:03:32,453
(Alex coughing)

1130
01:03:32,453 --> 01:03:35,620
(tense melodic music)

1131
01:03:37,788 --> 01:03:39,930
- Yeah, they're over here
in the, in the alley,

1132
01:03:39,930 --> 01:03:41,520
my, my friend.

1133
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,535
Alex, come on.

1134
01:03:43,535 --> 01:03:46,452
(soft tense music)

1135
01:03:58,550 --> 01:04:00,494
- Oh, there he is.

1136
01:04:00,494 --> 01:04:02,160
(soft melodic music)

1137
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,113
- It hurts so much.

1138
01:04:05,135 --> 01:04:06,780
- You're gonna be okay.

1139
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:07,613
- Hm.

1140
01:04:09,090 --> 01:04:10,440
- [Veronica] Okay.

1141
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:11,343
- So you drank?

1142
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:15,000
- I can't do this with you right now, GJ.

1143
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,791
- [Gracie] I thought you were done.

1144
01:04:16,791 --> 01:04:18,208
- Yeah, so did I.

1145
01:04:21,057 --> 01:04:23,010
Did they find the guy?

1146
01:04:23,010 --> 01:04:25,653
- No, not yet anyway.

1147
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:29,190
- So what happened?

1148
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:32,130
- This asshole called me a faggot.

1149
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:33,993
- [Gracie] And you fought him?

1150
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:36,960
- What was I supposed to do?

1151
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,845
- Walk away, let it go.

1152
01:04:38,845 --> 01:04:41,141
- I'm tired of being
pushed around, Gracie.

1153
01:04:41,141 --> 01:04:43,983
- You could have been killed, Alex!

1154
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:48,900
- You have every right to
stand up for yourself, baby,

1155
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:50,502
but you have to pick your battles.

1156
01:04:50,502 --> 01:04:53,017
- You know this started
when Shane moved in?

1157
01:04:53,017 --> 01:04:54,637
You should have listened to me.

1158
01:04:54,637 --> 01:04:57,750
- Well, I'm a little more
concerned with being the victim

1159
01:04:57,750 --> 01:05:00,000
of a hate crime right now,
if that's okay with you.

1160
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,408
- No, actually it's not
okay, it's not okay at all,

1161
01:05:02,408 --> 01:05:04,560
because there shouldn't
have been a hate crime.

1162
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,060
You weren't supposed to be drunk,

1163
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:07,620
you weren't supposed to be hooking up

1164
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:09,030
and you for damn sure
weren't supposed to be

1165
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:11,833
starting a fight with
some homophobic jackass!

1166
01:05:11,833 --> 01:05:14,294
You were supposed to
be with me at my show,

1167
01:05:14,294 --> 01:05:16,285
because it was my night!

1168
01:05:16,285 --> 01:05:17,640
(Alex sighing)

1169
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:20,220
Yeah, after I talked you
up to my boss's husband,

1170
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:22,320
told him all about my
talented best friend,

1171
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:24,420
who didn't even bother to fucking show up!

1172
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,193
- Shit, Gracie, I'm,

1173
01:05:28,527 --> 01:05:29,397
I'm sorry.

1174
01:05:29,397 --> 01:05:32,700
- I'm so done with you,
Alex, I have one life

1175
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:35,463
and I am done trying
to help you fix yours!

1176
01:05:36,570 --> 01:05:38,486
Good luck, Veronica, you're a saint.

1177
01:05:38,486 --> 01:05:39,319
- Gracie.

1178
01:05:41,955 --> 01:05:44,872
(Veronica sighing)

1179
01:05:46,492 --> 01:05:47,700
(door thudding)

1180
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:49,443
- So I guess you hate me now too?

1181
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:51,873
- No, honey,

1182
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,713
I love you and I'm your sponsor,

1183
01:05:57,570 --> 01:05:59,073
but I can't run your life.

1184
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:04,042
I'm just here to try
to help you stay sober.

1185
01:06:04,042 --> 01:06:05,403
Do you want that?

1186
01:06:07,271 --> 01:06:08,580
- I really don't know.

1187
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:12,400
- Well, you think about it and let me know

1188
01:06:13,716 --> 01:06:15,753
and I urge you to ask yourself,

1189
01:06:17,082 --> 01:06:20,043
do you want the rest of
your life to look like this?

1190
01:06:21,264 --> 01:06:24,514
(gentle melodic music)

1191
01:06:29,557 --> 01:06:33,047
Here you go, slowly.
- Mm-hm, mm-hm, okay.

1192
01:06:33,047 --> 01:06:34,590
- Do you need anything?

1193
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:36,420
- No, they said the
pillow, I should be okay,

1194
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:37,470
I just, I don't know.

1195
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:41,400
- Do you want me to stay?

1196
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,640
- No, it's fine, Ronnie,
you've done enough really.

1197
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:45,646
- [Veronica] Okay.

1198
01:06:45,646 --> 01:06:46,923
- What happened to you?

1199
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:49,863
- He was gay bashed.

1200
01:06:55,870 --> 01:06:57,678
- Did you put up a good fight?

1201
01:06:57,678 --> 01:06:59,643
- He cracked his ribs, you know.

1202
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:02,843
- Here,

1203
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:06,683
for next time.

1204
01:07:06,683 --> 01:07:08,934
(flick knife clicking)

1205
01:07:08,934 --> 01:07:11,013
I believe in protecting myself.

1206
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:15,180
- What you do is none of my business.

1207
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:17,220
- Just like it was none of your business,

1208
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:20,670
when I moved into a house
where his father was murdered?

1209
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:22,073
Alex told me you knew.

1210
01:07:22,073 --> 01:07:25,475
- That was Alex's business
to disclose if he wanted to,

1211
01:07:25,475 --> 01:07:28,260
there was no law that said he had to.

1212
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:30,613
- Hm, I see how it works.

1213
01:07:30,613 --> 01:07:31,923
- I don't think you do.

1214
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,013
Honey, I'm gonna come
back and check on you.

1215
01:07:42,501 --> 01:07:45,751
(gentle melodic music)

1216
01:07:49,622 --> 01:07:50,455
- Bye.

1217
01:07:57,047 --> 01:07:58,147
- She's wrong, you know.

1218
01:07:58,147 --> 01:08:00,033
- Would you get off of her?

1219
01:08:00,989 --> 01:08:02,820
She helps a lot of people.

1220
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:04,120
- I never said she didn't.

1221
01:08:05,099 --> 01:08:07,193
- I shouldn't have pushed that guy.

1222
01:08:07,193 --> 01:08:09,720
- If you don't stand up
for yourself, who will?

1223
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:11,333
- It was stupid, it was stupid.

1224
01:08:11,333 --> 01:08:13,230
- Why are you so afraid to fight back?

1225
01:08:13,230 --> 01:08:14,433
- Look at me.

1226
01:08:18,664 --> 01:08:21,123
- You're stronger than
you think you are, Alex.

1227
01:08:29,667 --> 01:08:31,263
I wanna show you something.

1228
01:08:33,509 --> 01:08:36,259
(Shane knocking)

1229
01:08:44,469 --> 01:08:47,623
(door clicking)

1230
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:48,960
- [Grant] Peter?

1231
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:50,250
- Yeah.

1232
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:51,437
Grant?

1233
01:08:51,437 --> 01:08:53,133
- [Grant] Yeah, that's me.

1234
01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:55,560
Who are you?

1235
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:56,766
- A friend.

1236
01:08:56,766 --> 01:09:00,333
- I don't go alone these
days, you understand?

1237
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:03,971
- [Grant] Yeah, sure.

1238
01:09:03,971 --> 01:09:05,730
- Can we come in?

1239
01:09:05,730 --> 01:09:07,740
- [Grant] Oh, yeah.

1240
01:09:07,740 --> 01:09:08,573
- Thanks.

1241
01:09:11,036 --> 01:09:13,413
Ah, this is a nice place you have.

1242
01:09:13,413 --> 01:09:14,580
(door thudding)

1243
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:15,413
You live alone?

1244
01:09:16,530 --> 01:09:17,820
- Yeah, just me.

1245
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:21,000
Do you guys want a drink or something?

1246
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,323
- No, thanks.

1247
01:09:24,684 --> 01:09:26,340
- Okay, what do we do now?

1248
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:27,608
We could go to the bedroom,

1249
01:09:27,608 --> 01:09:29,658
if your friend doesn't mind staying here.

1250
01:09:31,230 --> 01:09:32,160
- Yeah, in a minute.

1251
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:34,773
I have a few more questions,
if you don't mind.

1252
01:09:36,990 --> 01:09:38,313
- Okay, sure.

1253
01:09:39,810 --> 01:09:41,760
- Can you tell me about Rachel Monahan?

1254
01:09:43,623 --> 01:09:46,643
- Why do you wanna know about her?

1255
01:09:46,643 --> 01:09:48,745
- I think you know why.

1256
01:09:48,745 --> 01:09:50,641
(soft tense music)

1257
01:09:50,641 --> 01:09:52,827
- Okay, you know what, you two
are starting to freak me out

1258
01:09:52,827 --> 01:09:55,856
and I think you should go.
- You're freaked out?

1259
01:09:55,856 --> 01:09:59,905
That's interesting, you
molested Rachel, a teenager,

1260
01:09:59,905 --> 01:10:01,590
you think Rachel was freaked out?

1261
01:10:01,590 --> 01:10:03,210
- Who the fuck are you?
- Who the fuck are you

1262
01:10:03,210 --> 01:10:04,093
to do that to a kid?

1263
01:10:04,093 --> 01:10:05,760
Did you do that to your
own fucking daughter,

1264
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,140
you punk bitch?
- Okay, get out!

1265
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:08,461
I'm gonna call the cops!
- Shut the fuck up!

1266
01:10:08,461 --> 01:10:09,495
(blow thudding)

1267
01:10:09,495 --> 01:10:10,620
(Grant thudding to floor)

1268
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:12,456
- Holy shit!

1269
01:10:12,456 --> 01:10:15,240
(soft tense music)

1270
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:17,730
- Come on!
(Grant coughing)

1271
01:10:17,730 --> 01:10:19,271
- Oh.

1272
01:10:19,271 --> 01:10:21,551
- This is your chance.

1273
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:22,770
(flick knife clicking)

1274
01:10:22,770 --> 01:10:23,720
You wanna kill him?

1275
01:10:25,477 --> 01:10:26,900
- [Alex] Shane, I can't.

1276
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:28,950
- If you don't do this,
he gets away with it.

1277
01:10:28,950 --> 01:10:30,927
- I'm not killing anybody.

1278
01:10:30,927 --> 01:10:32,677
(knife clattering to floor)

1279
01:10:32,677 --> 01:10:34,891
(soft tense music)

1280
01:10:34,891 --> 01:10:39,891
(kicks thudding)
(Grant groaning)

1281
01:10:42,048 --> 01:10:44,253
- You have a choice here, Alex,

1282
01:10:45,385 --> 01:10:48,077
you can crawl back to
that safe, little cave

1283
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:49,600
and drink your life away

1284
01:10:50,639 --> 01:10:53,403
or you can give this sick
fuck what he deserves.

1285
01:10:58,171 --> 01:11:03,171
(kicks thudding)
(Grant groaning)

1286
01:11:06,410 --> 01:11:08,371
- Fuck!

1287
01:11:08,371 --> 01:11:11,121
(Grant groaning)

1288
01:11:14,237 --> 01:11:18,510
- No, no! (groaning)

1289
01:11:18,510 --> 01:11:19,343
Stop.

1290
01:11:21,677 --> 01:11:24,930
- Look at yourself, Grant, you did this,

1291
01:11:24,930 --> 01:11:26,469
you brought this on.

1292
01:11:26,469 --> 01:11:27,302
(flick knife clicking)

1293
01:11:27,302 --> 01:11:29,110
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1294
01:11:29,110 --> 01:11:30,930
- Think hard about what he did, Alex.

1295
01:11:30,930 --> 01:11:31,763
- Shane.

1296
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,050
- No, no, please don't.

1297
01:11:34,050 --> 01:11:35,570
- Should I do it?
- No!

1298
01:11:35,570 --> 01:11:37,370
- No, stop, stop, don't, please.

1299
01:11:37,370 --> 01:11:38,940
(knife thudding)

1300
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:43,940
(soft tense music)
(Grant gurgling)

1301
01:11:47,908 --> 01:11:49,099
(Grant gasping softly)

1302
01:11:49,099 --> 01:11:52,761
(Grant thudding to floor)

1303
01:11:52,761 --> 01:11:54,423
- One less monster.

1304
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:56,693
- Shit.

1305
01:11:58,230 --> 01:11:59,553
You had no right.

1306
01:12:03,788 --> 01:12:07,140
- He's nothing but a
fucking schoolyard-stalking

1307
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:10,413
child molester, do you really
think he deserved to live?

1308
01:12:12,554 --> 01:12:13,387
Do you?

1309
01:12:17,996 --> 01:12:19,383
That's what I thought.

1310
01:12:21,046 --> 01:12:23,963
(soft tense music)

1311
01:12:28,148 --> 01:12:31,481
(background rock music)

1312
01:12:37,024 --> 01:12:38,820
I don't think I need to tell you this,

1313
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:40,710
but this isn't something you
run and tell your sponsor

1314
01:12:40,710 --> 01:12:42,417
or little girlfriend about.
- Yeah, why not?

1315
01:12:42,417 --> 01:12:44,880
- Are you fucking serious?
- Are you fucking serious?

1316
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:47,673
I didn't fucking do
this, I didn't want this!

1317
01:12:52,594 --> 01:12:54,449
- Give me your shirt.

1318
01:12:54,449 --> 01:12:56,223
- What?
- There's blood on it.

1319
01:13:04,316 --> 01:13:07,543
- Does anything you fucking
listen to have lyrics?

1320
01:13:12,534 --> 01:13:17,534
(blows thudding)
(upbeat rock music)

1321
01:13:24,414 --> 01:13:27,914
(Shane breathing heavily)

1322
01:13:33,707 --> 01:13:36,254
(Shane roaring)

1323
01:13:36,254 --> 01:13:41,254
(blows thudding)
(upbeat rock music)

1324
01:13:54,107 --> 01:13:56,043
- How's that working out for you?

1325
01:14:00,507 --> 01:14:04,743
- What you did tonight,
have you done it before?

1326
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:16,923
- People pay for my company,
I look up their address.

1327
01:14:18,678 --> 01:14:22,233
If they're not on a list,
then everyone has a good time,

1328
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:28,002
but if they are, yes,
I do the right thing.

1329
01:14:28,002 --> 01:14:29,310
- Kill people?

1330
01:14:29,310 --> 01:14:30,783
- That deserve to die.

1331
01:14:32,467 --> 01:14:33,483
- You're not God.

1332
01:14:39,930 --> 01:14:40,773
- Alex.

1333
01:14:43,410 --> 01:14:44,943
I'm doing God's work.

1334
01:14:46,272 --> 01:14:48,273
- What the fuck happened to you?

1335
01:14:49,328 --> 01:14:50,883
- That doesn't matter,

1336
01:14:53,010 --> 01:14:54,208
all that is in the past.

1337
01:14:54,208 --> 01:14:57,586
What matters now is we set things right.

1338
01:14:57,586 --> 01:14:59,575
- They deserve a second chance.

1339
01:14:59,575 --> 01:15:01,263
- Do you really believe that?

1340
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:09,273
Some people, after they're
abused, they commit suicide.

1341
01:15:12,403 --> 01:15:14,343
Did they get a second chance?

1342
01:15:17,378 --> 01:15:19,117
- I want you out.

1343
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:23,403
I'm calling the cops.

1344
01:15:25,007 --> 01:15:26,873
- Calling the cops, yeah.

1345
01:15:28,016 --> 01:15:30,633
(gentle melodic music)

1346
01:15:30,633 --> 01:15:34,113
It's okay, call the cops then,

1347
01:15:35,482 --> 01:15:37,380
you were there too.

1348
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:38,490
- So what?

1349
01:15:38,490 --> 01:15:42,063
- In fact, you're the one that killed him.

1350
01:15:43,170 --> 01:15:47,373
I tried to stop you, I have
your shirt with his blood on it.

1351
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:50,850
- Fuck you.

1352
01:15:50,850 --> 01:15:52,583
- No, fuck you, Alex!

1353
01:15:57,752 --> 01:15:58,585
Fuck you.

1354
01:16:07,475 --> 01:16:10,392
(soft piano music)

1355
01:16:18,263 --> 01:16:19,418
(objects clattering)

1356
01:16:19,418 --> 01:16:22,415
(Alex thudding to floor)

1357
01:16:22,415 --> 01:16:23,851
- Fuck.

1358
01:16:23,851 --> 01:16:26,768
(soft piano music)

1359
01:16:38,628 --> 01:16:39,461
Gracie.

1360
01:16:41,598 --> 01:16:42,431
Gracie

1361
01:16:45,047 --> 01:16:45,880
I'm sorry.

1362
01:16:48,417 --> 01:16:49,584
I'm fucked up,

1363
01:16:51,734 --> 01:16:52,984
but I love you.

1364
01:16:56,718 --> 01:16:58,718
I'd do anything for you.

1365
01:17:00,087 --> 01:17:01,930
(bag thudding)

1366
01:17:01,930 --> 01:17:05,103
(soft piano music)

1367
01:17:05,103 --> 01:17:07,203
I told you to get the fuck out.

1368
01:17:10,373 --> 01:17:11,823
- Tell me one thing.

1369
01:17:17,203 --> 01:17:19,353
What were you gonna say to your dad?

1370
01:17:20,309 --> 01:17:22,383
- I don't have to tell you shit.

1371
01:17:30,257 --> 01:17:31,423
- Yeah, you do.

1372
01:17:34,769 --> 01:17:36,602
- I was, I don't know,

1373
01:17:37,873 --> 01:17:40,640
just gonna see if he'd changed.

1374
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,903
Maybe give him a second
chance, I don't know.

1375
01:17:43,770 --> 01:17:44,973
- And then what?

1376
01:17:48,404 --> 01:17:50,313
Pretend nothing ever happened?

1377
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:55,039
(soft piano music)

1378
01:17:55,039 --> 01:17:57,033
You gonna drink some more?

1379
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:01,113
Maybe try to kill yourself again.

1380
01:18:02,875 --> 01:18:04,533
- You're fucking crazy.

1381
01:18:08,054 --> 01:18:09,723
- You try to kill yourself.

1382
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:13,803
I kill monsters.

1383
01:18:17,727 --> 01:18:19,473
Who's the crazy one here?

1384
01:18:27,060 --> 01:18:28,424
- Bye.

1385
01:18:28,424 --> 01:18:31,341
(soft piano music)

1386
01:18:53,810 --> 01:18:57,060
(light haunting music)

1387
01:19:00,490 --> 01:19:03,157
(Alex groaning)

1388
01:19:04,842 --> 01:19:08,711
- [Gracie] There are a
lot of really sick people

1389
01:19:08,711 --> 01:19:09,746
in this world.

1390
01:19:09,746 --> 01:19:14,746
- [Veronica] If you can think
of him as sick instead of bad,

1391
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:19,830
the shift in your perception
might be the miracle you need.

1392
01:19:20,889 --> 01:19:24,222
(soft orchestral music)

1393
01:19:28,706 --> 01:19:30,456
- I forgive you, Dad.

1394
01:19:37,184 --> 01:19:38,351
I forgive you.

1395
01:19:40,907 --> 01:19:41,862
(birds chirping)

1396
01:19:41,862 --> 01:19:45,210
- There's more than 300
murders a year in New York

1397
01:19:45,210 --> 01:19:47,179
and almost 10.000 unsolved murders.

1398
01:19:47,179 --> 01:19:52,140
- What, what are the odds
of, of, of us catching him?

1399
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:56,490
- This guy knows what he's
doing, he doesn't leave a trail,

1400
01:19:56,490 --> 01:19:58,773
but I won't stop until we find him.

1401
01:20:01,077 --> 01:20:05,073
- I should've just called you sooner.

1402
01:20:06,450 --> 01:20:07,590
Stupid.

1403
01:20:07,590 --> 01:20:11,913
- Some people never report
a crime, it takes courage.

1404
01:20:16,813 --> 01:20:17,646
- Thanks.

1405
01:20:19,491 --> 01:20:22,408
(soft tense music)

1406
01:20:27,441 --> 01:20:30,108
(door clicking)

1407
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:36,221
(door thudding)

1408
01:20:36,221 --> 01:20:37,720
(light switch clicking)

1409
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:39,438
(keys jangling)

1410
01:20:39,438 --> 01:20:42,445
(soft tense music)

1411
01:20:42,445 --> 01:20:45,112
(phone ringing)

1412
01:20:46,230 --> 01:20:47,063
Gracie.

1413
01:20:47,063 --> 01:20:48,180
- I have nothing to say to you, Alex.

1414
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:50,430
- [Alex] Let me just explain
to you, I know it's different,

1415
01:20:50,430 --> 01:20:51,510
it's different.
- I don't care.

1416
01:20:51,510 --> 01:20:52,980
- [Alex] You were right about Shane, okay.

1417
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:55,530
- [Gracie] I don't care, it's
always the same with you.

1418
01:20:55,530 --> 01:20:57,537
- [Alex] No, I know, but
he's dangerous, Gracie.

1419
01:20:57,537 --> 01:20:58,583
(soft tense music)
- Goodbye, Alex.

1420
01:21:00,258 --> 01:21:03,008
(Gracie gasping)

1421
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:06,603
- God, I'm having a bad day here.

1422
01:21:07,447 --> 01:21:10,364
(soft piano music)

1423
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:14,793
(Veronica sobbing)

1424
01:21:14,793 --> 01:21:17,460
(Alex knocking)

1425
01:21:19,905 --> 01:21:23,406
Oh.

1426
01:21:23,406 --> 01:21:26,989
(Veronica clearing throat)

1427
01:21:31,515 --> 01:21:32,730
(door clicking)

1428
01:21:32,730 --> 01:21:34,143
- Gracie won't speak to me.

1429
01:21:35,010 --> 01:21:37,410
- No how are you

1430
01:21:37,410 --> 01:21:41,220
or I'm sorry for dropping
by without calling?

1431
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:43,200
- I did call, you didn't
answer, I'm sorry,

1432
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:44,490
but Gracie won't see me.

1433
01:21:44,490 --> 01:21:48,630
- Alex, you relapsed, you missed her show.

1434
01:21:48,630 --> 01:21:51,420
You do nothing but think about yourself,

1435
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:52,863
including right now.

1436
01:21:56,130 --> 01:21:58,713
Honey, I am beat,

1437
01:21:59,670 --> 01:22:01,323
do you want anything else?

1438
01:22:02,370 --> 01:22:04,500
- I need to know how I can
get Gracie to forgive me,

1439
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:06,698
Ronnie, please.
- Stop saying I'm sorry,

1440
01:22:06,698 --> 01:22:08,850
it's just words.

1441
01:22:08,850 --> 01:22:13,050
Show up, be the friend she's been to you.

1442
01:22:13,050 --> 01:22:17,040
You do anything you
want, no matter the cost.

1443
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:18,813
It's time to grow up, Alex.

1444
01:22:21,630 --> 01:22:23,264
- Thanks.

1445
01:22:23,264 --> 01:22:24,903
I'm sorry I bothered you.

1446
01:22:26,610 --> 01:22:28,219
- Alex. (sobbing)

1447
01:22:28,219 --> 01:22:30,000
(soft orchestral music)

1448
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:34,593
When I lost Ethan, I
woke up and I got sober,

1449
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:38,553
but being sober is only the beginning.

1450
01:22:39,930 --> 01:22:43,170
You've got to show Gracie real change,

1451
01:22:43,170 --> 01:22:45,303
before she can trust you again.

1452
01:22:46,693 --> 01:22:49,450
You have a chance that I didn't have

1453
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:55,773
and with time and with
patience, you can fix this,

1454
01:22:56,670 --> 01:22:58,203
I know you can.

1455
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:01,683
- Goodnight, Ronnie.

1456
01:23:03,401 --> 01:23:06,734
(soft orchestral music)

1457
01:23:07,651 --> 01:23:08,876
(car door thudding)

1458
01:23:08,876 --> 01:23:10,147
(Veronica sobbing)

1459
01:23:10,147 --> 01:23:11,591
(car engine starting)

1460
01:23:11,591 --> 01:23:14,174
(car rumbling)

1461
01:23:16,702 --> 01:23:19,320
(phone ringing)
(soft tense music)

1462
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:20,153
- GJ.

1463
01:23:20,153 --> 01:23:21,693
- [Shane] No, but she's here.

1464
01:23:22,959 --> 01:23:24,718
- I'm calling the cops.
- You don't wanna do that,

1465
01:23:24,718 --> 01:23:27,210
not if you wanna see your
little girlfriend alive.

1466
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:30,219
- Leave her alone, you fuck,
this is between you and me!

1467
01:23:30,219 --> 01:23:31,830
- [Shane] I want you to
come to the garage, Alex,

1468
01:23:31,830 --> 01:23:33,550
she's running out time.
- Gracie!

1469
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:36,476
(tense orchestral music)

1470
01:23:36,476 --> 01:23:38,254
(car engine idling)

1471
01:23:38,254 --> 01:23:39,087
Gracie!

1472
01:23:40,033 --> 01:23:41,537
- Alex!
- Gracie! (hands tapping)

1473
01:23:41,537 --> 01:23:42,486
(Alex thudding)
Uh!

1474
01:23:42,486 --> 01:23:43,770
- I said I'd make a
fighter out of you, Alex.

1475
01:23:43,770 --> 01:23:46,072
The only way to do that is to
get rid of your little crutch.

1476
01:23:46,072 --> 01:23:48,690
You're gonna have to
fight harder than that.

1477
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:50,464
You really wanna let her die?

1478
01:23:50,464 --> 01:23:51,473
(Alex grunting)

1479
01:23:51,473 --> 01:23:53,253
(tense orchestral music)

1480
01:23:53,253 --> 01:23:56,135
You said you'd do anything
for Gracie, prove it!

1481
01:23:56,135 --> 01:23:58,051
(head thudding)
- Uh!

1482
01:23:58,051 --> 01:24:01,941
(blows thudding)
(Alex grunting)

1483
01:24:01,941 --> 01:24:05,210
(tense orchestral music)

1484
01:24:05,210 --> 01:24:07,680
- Do you really wanna know
what happened to me, Alex?

1485
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:09,270
I went away to Little League camp.

1486
01:24:09,270 --> 01:24:12,723
Your dad, that sick fuck, he was my coach!

1487
01:24:12,723 --> 01:24:15,788
You know what he did
to me, don't you, Alex?

1488
01:24:15,788 --> 01:24:19,050
I can't count how many years
I walked around ashamed,

1489
01:24:19,050 --> 01:24:21,810
a loser, weak!

1490
01:24:21,810 --> 01:24:25,342
But then I found a way
out, I became a fighter

1491
01:24:25,342 --> 01:24:27,540
and every time I kill
one of those monsters,

1492
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:29,473
I see your dad's face!

1493
01:24:29,473 --> 01:24:32,840
(Alex roaring)
(blow thudding)

1494
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:33,926
- Gracie!
(Gracie screaming)

1495
01:24:33,926 --> 01:24:35,923
- How are the ribs, Alex?

1496
01:24:35,923 --> 01:24:37,108
- No, argh!

1497
01:24:37,108 --> 01:24:38,159
(head thudding)

1498
01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:40,647
(Alex thudding to floor)

1499
01:24:40,647 --> 01:24:43,180
- I did the world a
favor killing your father

1500
01:24:45,873 --> 01:24:47,443
and I tried to help you,

1501
01:24:47,443 --> 01:24:50,613
because I know what it
feels like to be afraid.

1502
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:53,070
(Gracie sobbing fearfully)

1503
01:24:53,070 --> 01:24:55,983
I tried to help you become
somebody that fights back.

1504
01:24:57,232 --> 01:24:59,354
(car horn tooting)

1505
01:24:59,354 --> 01:25:01,811
You really think he's
gonna save you, Gracie?

1506
01:25:01,811 --> 01:25:03,420
He's done nothing but let you down,

1507
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:05,529
why should today be any different?

1508
01:25:05,529 --> 01:25:07,242
(light switch clicking)

1509
01:25:07,242 --> 01:25:08,672
(car engine idling)

1510
01:25:08,672 --> 01:25:11,478
(tense orchestral music)

1511
01:25:11,478 --> 01:25:13,833
Hope this is your best shot, Alex.

1512
01:25:17,845 --> 01:25:19,433
- Uh!
- What are you gonna do now,

1513
01:25:19,433 --> 01:25:21,940
give me a second chance?

1514
01:25:21,940 --> 01:25:23,901
- I learned a lot from you, Shane.

1515
01:25:23,901 --> 01:25:27,840
(flick knife clicking)
(flick knife thudding)

1516
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:29,433
Like always carry a knife.

1517
01:25:30,305 --> 01:25:33,722
(tense orchestral music)

1518
01:25:36,885 --> 01:25:40,599
(Shane thudding to floor)

1519
01:25:40,599 --> 01:25:41,432
Gracie.

1520
01:25:42,465 --> 01:25:45,882
(tense orchestral music)

1521
01:25:48,172 --> 01:25:50,593
(blows thudding)
(Alex grunting)

1522
01:25:50,593 --> 01:25:54,141
(glass shattering)

1523
01:25:54,141 --> 01:25:57,141
(car door clicking)

1524
01:25:58,810 --> 01:26:01,060
Gracie, Gracie, Gracie!

1525
01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:04,170
(soft orchestral music)

1526
01:26:04,170 --> 01:26:07,100
(tape tearing)
(Alex grunting)

1527
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:08,550
Come on, Gracie.

1528
01:26:08,550 --> 01:26:13,550
Come on, Gracie, Gracie, Gracie, please.

1529
01:26:13,849 --> 01:26:15,766
Gracie, Gracie, Gracie.

1530
01:26:18,453 --> 01:26:19,958
Come on, Gracie!

1531
01:26:19,958 --> 01:26:22,541
(hand patting)

1532
01:26:24,451 --> 01:26:26,618
Come on, come on, come on!

1533
01:26:28,014 --> 01:26:28,847
Come on!

1534
01:26:30,088 --> 01:26:32,471
Gracie! (wailing)

1535
01:26:32,471 --> 01:26:34,595
(Gracie gasping)
Argh!

1536
01:26:34,595 --> 01:26:36,316
(Gracie coughing)

1537
01:26:36,316 --> 01:26:37,952
You're good.

1538
01:26:37,952 --> 01:26:39,053
(Gracie screaming)
No, it's me, it's me!

1539
01:26:40,151 --> 01:26:43,347
It's me, it's Alex, Alex,
it's Alex, it's Alex.

1540
01:26:43,347 --> 01:26:46,097
(Gracie sobbing)

1541
01:26:47,610 --> 01:26:48,942
Breathe.

1542
01:26:48,942 --> 01:26:52,275
(soft orchestral music)

1543
01:26:56,580 --> 01:26:58,177
That's good, that's good.

1544
01:26:59,511 --> 01:27:02,261
(Gracie sobbing)

1545
01:27:07,261 --> 01:27:12,261
Come on.

1546
01:27:18,466 --> 01:27:21,966
(gentle orchestral music)

1547
01:27:26,210 --> 01:27:28,470
- Oh, my God, baby, are you okay?

1548
01:27:30,834 --> 01:27:31,667
Oh.

1549
01:27:33,625 --> 01:27:34,792
Oh, it's okay.

1550
01:27:36,504 --> 01:27:37,337
It's okay.

1551
01:27:44,629 --> 01:27:49,446
- [Gracie] "Dear Alex,
I wish you only love.

1552
01:27:49,446 --> 01:27:51,654
I hope you figure it all out,

1553
01:27:51,654 --> 01:27:54,003
I hope you go after your dreams,

1554
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:57,393
but I need to focus on me for a while.

1555
01:27:58,470 --> 01:27:59,850
You know I care about you,

1556
01:27:59,850 --> 01:28:02,853
I just can't be with you right now.

1557
01:28:03,719 --> 01:28:06,393
You have to take these
first steps on your own.

1558
01:28:08,010 --> 01:28:10,437
Love Gracie Jean."

1559
01:28:13,248 --> 01:28:17,165
(background people chattering)

1560
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:19,133
