1
00:03:09,134 --> 00:03:10,965
Thanks, sweetheart.

2
00:04:27,379 --> 00:04:30,644
<i>Hey, babe, it's me. Listen, I'm gonna</i>
<i>do the double shift tonight...</i>

3
00:04:30,816 --> 00:04:34,047
<i>...so I won't be home till morning.</i>
<i>I'll try back later.</i>

4
00:04:34,252 --> 00:04:38,188
<i>Oh, hey, I got you some flowers.</i>
<i>I hope you like them. Love you.</i>

5
00:04:38,557 --> 00:04:41,185
<i>Hey, Claudia, it's Missy.</i>
<i>I just got the sonogram done.</i>

6
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:44,760
<i>You guys gotta come over and see it.</i>
<i>Okay. Call me. Bye.</i>

7
00:04:45,664 --> 00:04:47,029
<i>Claudia, it's Kelly.</i>

8
00:04:47,232 --> 00:04:49,666
<i>Don't forget to go food shopping</i>
<i>for Mom this week.</i>

9
00:04:49,835 --> 00:04:52,326
<i>And don't forget the cigarettes.</i>
<i>Talk to you.</i>

10
00:05:35,814 --> 00:05:37,611
Thanks a lot.

11
00:06:44,616 --> 00:06:46,277
Hey, Ma?

12
00:06:47,686 --> 00:06:49,779
Hey, Mom, are you home?

13
00:07:02,968 --> 00:07:07,132
-I guess you got the check I sent?
-Yeah. Yeah, thanks.

14
00:07:07,305 --> 00:07:10,672
I'll-- I'll pay you back
in a couple of weeks.

15
00:07:10,842 --> 00:07:12,673
Yeah, I won't hold my breath.

16
00:07:12,877 --> 00:07:15,402
So is this a friendly visit
or are you home for good?

17
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,208
No, don't worry, don't worry.
It's just a little visit.

18
00:07:18,383 --> 00:07:21,216
Yeah? What happened? Fired again?

19
00:07:21,553 --> 00:07:23,919
No, no, this time-- This time I quit.

20
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:27,051
Oh, good for you.

21
00:07:27,425 --> 00:07:30,792
Listen, I'm not gonna stand
for your bullshit this time, Charles.

22
00:07:31,896 --> 00:07:34,888
The last three years have been
very peaceful here without you.

23
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,269
Act like an adult or you're out
on your ass. You understand?

24
00:07:39,104 --> 00:07:41,868
Yeah, yeah. I understand.

25
00:07:43,942 --> 00:07:47,002
And get that goddamn car
off my lawn too.

26
00:07:50,882 --> 00:07:53,942
And don't touch
any of my beers either.

27
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,231
So, Claud,
when did you hear about this?

28
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:16,771
This afternoon at the diner.
Alice Smith told me.

29
00:08:16,941 --> 00:08:18,465
-Who's Alice Smith?
-Alice Smith.

30
00:08:18,643 --> 00:08:20,474
That slut that lives
across the street.

31
00:08:20,712 --> 00:08:22,407
Teresa, don't hold that against her.

32
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:26,016
As far as I'm concerned, there aren't
enough chicks around like her.

33
00:08:26,951 --> 00:08:28,350
What?

34
00:08:28,553 --> 00:08:30,043
I wonder if he's home for good.

35
00:08:30,221 --> 00:08:33,088
Did Happy Legs say
he was home for good?

36
00:08:33,258 --> 00:08:36,921
We really didn't talk about it, Goldie.
She asked me if I knew he was home.

37
00:08:37,462 --> 00:08:39,157
Does he know about you guys?

38
00:08:40,231 --> 00:08:42,131
I have no idea.

39
00:08:43,134 --> 00:08:46,626
-You think maybe he'd be pissed?
-I don't give a shit what he thinks.

40
00:08:46,805 --> 00:08:50,400
Come on, you know the guy since
first grade. Give him a break already.

41
00:08:50,575 --> 00:08:52,805
Are you kidding?
This guy's always been a mutt.

42
00:08:52,977 --> 00:08:55,639
He's trying to bang any skank
he can get his hands on.

43
00:08:55,814 --> 00:08:58,874
Even so, I think somebody
should tell him.

44
00:08:59,451 --> 00:09:01,544
I don't give a shit who tells him.
Tell him.

45
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:03,584
Claudia, what do you think?

46
00:09:04,823 --> 00:09:06,791
Yeah, probably.

47
00:09:07,392 --> 00:09:12,386
All right, I'll go by his house
tomorrow after work. I'll go see him.

48
00:09:12,897 --> 00:09:15,297
Mike, come by with me.

49
00:09:15,467 --> 00:09:17,628
Fine. You want me to tell him,
I'll tell him.

50
00:09:17,802 --> 00:09:19,292
Happy now, you pain in the ass?

51
00:09:19,504 --> 00:09:23,440
-I just think it's the right thing.
-Congratulations, Huck Finn.

52
00:09:23,641 --> 00:09:25,836
-Teresa, can I get another drink?
-In a minute.

53
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:30,003
Teresa, I'll take one too.
And put it on Claudia's tab.

54
00:09:55,006 --> 00:09:56,473
Hey, nice car, man.

55
00:09:56,674 --> 00:09:59,837
Just make sure you scumbags
keep your hands off it.

56
00:10:20,098 --> 00:10:23,192
-Hey, Michael, what's happening, man?
-How you doing?

57
00:10:23,368 --> 00:10:26,030
I hear you're home for a week
and nobody hears from you.

58
00:10:26,204 --> 00:10:28,365
Yeah, look,
I was gonna call you guys...

59
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:33,102
...but I figured I'd run into you
sooner or later. So, what's up?

60
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:36,247
Nothing. I hear you're home,
I figured I'd come by, say hello.

61
00:10:36,414 --> 00:10:39,349
You gonna invite me in,
or are we gonna freeze our asses off?

62
00:10:39,517 --> 00:10:41,678
Yeah. Come on in.

63
00:10:46,491 --> 00:10:49,085
-Hey, Ma, you remember Michael, eh?
-Hey, Mrs. Ryan.

64
00:10:50,995 --> 00:10:52,724
Hey. How you doing?

65
00:10:54,499 --> 00:10:58,196
-What's up, man? Everything all right?
-Yeah. Everything's fine.

66
00:10:58,369 --> 00:11:00,303
Man, this place hasn't changed much.

67
00:11:00,538 --> 00:11:04,736
Yeah, my mom hasn't gotten around
to hiring the new interior decorator, so--

68
00:11:04,909 --> 00:11:07,969
I saw the Buick, I can't believe
you got that running again.

69
00:11:08,146 --> 00:11:10,546
Yeah, well. I still see
you're driving the Impala.

70
00:11:10,748 --> 00:11:12,648
I can't believe
that's still on the road.

71
00:11:12,817 --> 00:11:14,785
After you left,
I got a decent mechanic.

72
00:11:16,821 --> 00:11:18,789
So, what brings you back?
You miss home?

73
00:11:18,957 --> 00:11:22,154
Did I miss home or something?
Is there something here to miss?

74
00:11:22,393 --> 00:11:24,258
Hey, fuck you.

75
00:11:24,829 --> 00:11:27,320
So, what's the occasion?
You got any work lined up?

76
00:11:27,532 --> 00:11:30,000
Yeah, yeah, if you can believe it...

77
00:11:30,168 --> 00:11:33,137
...I'm back at Bugsy's pumping gas
a couple of days a week.

78
00:11:34,739 --> 00:11:36,730
So you seen anybody
since you're back?

79
00:11:36,941 --> 00:11:38,533
No, nobody.

80
00:11:39,444 --> 00:11:41,844
Hoping to run into Claudia
if she's still around.

81
00:11:42,013 --> 00:11:45,346
-That's what I came here to talk about.
-Oh, why? What's up?

82
00:11:45,516 --> 00:11:47,507
Please don't tell me she's married.

83
00:11:47,685 --> 00:11:49,983
Not exactly.

84
00:11:51,055 --> 00:11:52,852
We're together now.

85
00:11:54,092 --> 00:11:55,957
What do you mean,
you're together now?

86
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,628
We're together, we live together.

87
00:11:58,796 --> 00:12:01,492
Probably gonna get married
this summer.

88
00:12:03,601 --> 00:12:05,466
No shit.

89
00:12:06,804 --> 00:12:09,796
How long--? How long's
that been going on?

90
00:12:09,974 --> 00:12:12,670
-About three years.
-Three years?

91
00:12:12,844 --> 00:12:14,641
You didn't waste any fucking time.

92
00:12:14,812 --> 00:12:17,007
You treated her like shit
and you took off.

93
00:12:17,181 --> 00:12:18,671
At least I treat her good.

94
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,943
You and Claudia.

95
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,248
I can't-- Can't picture that.

96
00:12:24,188 --> 00:12:27,749
So, what's the deal,
you guys are engaged or something?

97
00:12:27,925 --> 00:12:29,153
Basically.

98
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,852
''Basically''? Hey, Michael,
how is one ''basically'' engaged?

99
00:12:33,398 --> 00:12:36,299
Look, we both decided
we wanted to get married...

100
00:12:36,501 --> 00:12:38,196
...but we haven't decided on a date.

101
00:12:38,369 --> 00:12:41,236
So I guess you'd say
we're not officially engaged.

102
00:12:41,406 --> 00:12:46,173
That's great man. Look, seriously,
no bullshit, I'm happy for you.

103
00:12:46,844 --> 00:12:48,539
-So you're cool with this?
-Look...

104
00:12:49,047 --> 00:12:51,208
...me and her were over
a long time ago.

105
00:12:51,716 --> 00:12:53,843
A long time ago, Charlie.

106
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:56,216
Yeah.

107
00:12:56,387 --> 00:12:59,379
-So no hard feelings?
-No, man.

108
00:13:00,224 --> 00:13:02,192
To old friends.

109
00:13:03,194 --> 00:13:05,025
Old friends.

110
00:13:12,437 --> 00:13:13,904
Hi, babe.

111
00:13:14,138 --> 00:13:17,073
-So how'd it go?
-What?

112
00:13:17,241 --> 00:13:19,937
-What, you didn't go see him?
-Yeah.

113
00:13:20,144 --> 00:13:23,545
-And?
-And he's still an asshole.

114
00:13:23,748 --> 00:13:27,946
Back pumping gas at Bugsy's.
Really setting the world on fire.

115
00:13:33,524 --> 00:13:37,517
-So did you tell him about us?
-Yeah.

116
00:13:37,729 --> 00:13:40,892
-How did he react?
-He was cool with it.

117
00:14:11,629 --> 00:14:13,256
Hey, you.

118
00:14:13,931 --> 00:14:15,728
What's happening?

119
00:14:28,813 --> 00:14:33,250
-You here to eat?
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm here to eat.

120
00:14:34,152 --> 00:14:37,212
-You know what you want?
-Yeah.

121
00:14:38,956 --> 00:14:42,585
Let me get a cheeseburger
and some fries, all right?

122
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,489
That it?

123
00:14:44,662 --> 00:14:48,291
No. No, actually,
there's something I wanna ask you.

124
00:14:48,466 --> 00:14:50,866
Can you sit down with me a second?

125
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,770
You can't see I'm working here?

126
00:14:55,506 --> 00:14:59,101
Hey, Claudia, it's not like this place
is exactly rocking, all right?

127
00:14:59,277 --> 00:15:02,269
Just sit down with me a second.
I'm not gonna bite you.

128
00:15:18,296 --> 00:15:19,661
So?

129
00:15:19,831 --> 00:15:24,200
So, you know, I just--
I wanted to come by and say I'm sorry...

130
00:15:24,368 --> 00:15:27,496
...for the way I just took off,
you know, when I left.

131
00:15:27,672 --> 00:15:29,640
So I'm sorry.

132
00:15:32,276 --> 00:15:34,574
-That's what you wanted to ask me?
-Yeah.

133
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,147
Yeah, and also, you know, I mean,
I just wanted to see if, you know...

134
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,181
...if you're happy with all this.

135
00:15:41,352 --> 00:15:45,083
Still living here, working in this
place, you know, your whole routine.

136
00:15:45,323 --> 00:15:47,382
-What business is that of yours?
-Come on.

137
00:15:47,558 --> 00:15:49,822
I've known you your whole life,
all right?

138
00:15:50,027 --> 00:15:52,791
I just can't see you
being okay with this.

139
00:15:53,498 --> 00:15:55,762
Well, it's not like
I'm gonna be here forever.

140
00:15:55,933 --> 00:15:58,299
Oh, really?
You see your friend back here?

141
00:15:58,669 --> 00:16:00,967
That's what she said too.
Now look at her.

142
00:16:01,138 --> 00:16:04,505
Another couple of months in this town
your hair's gonna turn blue too.

143
00:16:04,675 --> 00:16:06,472
You come here to eat
or to abuse me?

144
00:16:06,644 --> 00:16:09,442
No, look, look,
all I'm saying is, like...

145
00:16:09,614 --> 00:16:12,276
...what happened to all that stuff
you were gonna do?

146
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,408
Remember what I used to call you?

147
00:16:14,585 --> 00:16:16,951
''Cloudia.'' You always
had your head in the clouds.

148
00:16:17,121 --> 00:16:19,749
Talking about getting out of here,
seeing the world.

149
00:16:19,924 --> 00:16:21,789
What happened to that girl?

150
00:16:23,895 --> 00:16:26,830
I was 18 years old and I grew up.
That's what happened.

151
00:16:27,265 --> 00:16:29,927
What about you?
You were the one with big plans...

152
00:16:30,101 --> 00:16:31,591
...big dreams. What happened?

153
00:16:31,769 --> 00:16:35,865
I didn't give up, all right?
It just didn't work out this time.

154
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,975
In a month or so,
I'm gonna get the hell out of here again.

155
00:16:39,143 --> 00:16:41,202
I'm not sticking around here.

156
00:16:42,213 --> 00:16:44,238
So why did you bother
coming back home?

157
00:16:45,883 --> 00:16:47,544
Honestly?

158
00:16:48,853 --> 00:16:50,753
Because I wanted to see you.

159
00:16:55,092 --> 00:16:58,789
Yeah, well, hey,
here I am in all my glory.

160
00:16:58,963 --> 00:17:00,328
Now what are you gonna do?

161
00:17:00,765 --> 00:17:04,257
I'm thinking, you know, I'm thinking
if you're not so happy here...

162
00:17:04,435 --> 00:17:07,768
...then, you know, when I take off,
why don't you come with me?

163
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:10,907
Remember? Like we always said
we were gonna do?

164
00:17:11,108 --> 00:17:14,566
Oh, yeah. Just like that, no big deal.

165
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:16,110
You know what?

166
00:17:16,314 --> 00:17:19,010
I never said I wasn't happy, you did.

167
00:17:19,183 --> 00:17:20,980
Charlie, we've been here once before.

168
00:17:21,152 --> 00:17:22,847
We were kids,
it seemed so romantic.

169
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,284
But it don't seem so romantic now,
does it?

170
00:17:25,456 --> 00:17:27,117
Why not?

171
00:17:28,092 --> 00:17:29,559
Because of Michael?

172
00:17:30,161 --> 00:17:32,095
Partly.

173
00:17:33,631 --> 00:17:35,963
And because I don't trust you.

174
00:17:36,167 --> 00:17:39,967
Remember, you have a habit of running
away when things get a little ugly.

175
00:17:40,338 --> 00:17:42,465
What are you talking about?
Talking about--?

176
00:17:43,274 --> 00:17:45,469
You talking about the abortion?

177
00:17:45,977 --> 00:17:47,604
Yeah.

178
00:17:48,813 --> 00:17:50,747
I'm talking about the abortion.

179
00:17:51,849 --> 00:17:55,945
I stayed and made sure everything
was okay before I left, all right?

180
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,315
I even spoke to the guy
at the clinic.

181
00:17:59,557 --> 00:18:01,548
You even talked to that guy
at the clinic?

182
00:18:01,726 --> 00:18:03,353
Well, that was mighty big of you.

183
00:18:03,561 --> 00:18:05,552
You know something?
Everything wasn't okay.

184
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,595
I needed you
and you weren't there.

185
00:18:09,634 --> 00:18:10,862
What wasn't okay?

186
00:18:11,035 --> 00:18:13,629
Look, that doesn't
even matter now, okay?

187
00:18:13,804 --> 00:18:17,638
But to answer your question, no.
I don't wanna go anywhere with you.

188
00:18:21,646 --> 00:18:23,204
So, what are you gonna do?

189
00:18:23,447 --> 00:18:25,540
You're really gonna stay
and marry Michael?

190
00:18:25,716 --> 00:18:27,479
Yeah.

191
00:18:27,985 --> 00:18:31,352
-I don't see a ring anywhere.
-Don't worry. It's coming.

192
00:18:31,956 --> 00:18:34,254
I guess you play the cards
you're dealt, huh?

193
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,949
Or sometimes you just run away.

194
00:18:40,464 --> 00:18:43,024
Look, I'm gonna
get back to work, okay?

195
00:18:43,234 --> 00:18:45,964
So just-- Just leave me alone.

196
00:18:46,971 --> 00:18:48,404
Fine.

197
00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:17,833
-Oh, hey, babe.
-Hi, honey.

198
00:19:20,905 --> 00:19:22,395
What are you still doing awake?

199
00:19:22,573 --> 00:19:25,007
Nothing, really.
Just figured I'd wait up for you.

200
00:19:25,209 --> 00:19:28,110
Oh, sorry.
I went over to Goldie's after work.

201
00:19:28,312 --> 00:19:31,076
He wanted to show me
Missy's sonogram.

202
00:19:31,282 --> 00:19:33,045
They're gonna have a boy.

203
00:19:33,784 --> 00:19:36,810
I think I saw his little pecker,
it was really cool.

204
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:43,654
You're gonna make a great father,
aren't you?

205
00:19:43,894 --> 00:19:45,794
I'm gonna try.

206
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,396
We got a good thing.

207
00:19:51,569 --> 00:19:53,264
Don't we?

208
00:19:53,771 --> 00:19:55,671
Yeah, we do.

209
00:20:33,611 --> 00:20:35,442
-Hey, Kelly.
-Hey, babe. What's up?

210
00:20:35,646 --> 00:20:38,080
-Is Mom up yet?
-She's right there in the kitchen.

211
00:20:38,282 --> 00:20:39,943
Oh, well, don't get up or anything.

212
00:20:40,117 --> 00:20:42,517
Hold your horses, I'm coming.

213
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,345
-Hey, Ma.
-Hi, hon.

214
00:20:46,524 --> 00:20:49,357
Oh, Claudia, I told you
you didn't have to do that.

215
00:20:49,527 --> 00:20:51,358
I can go to the store myself,
you know.

216
00:20:51,529 --> 00:20:53,394
Yeah, well, don't worry about it.

217
00:20:53,564 --> 00:20:56,897
-So what's going on Kelly, anything?
-Same shit, different day.

218
00:20:57,067 --> 00:20:58,932
-Can't get a date.
-You're one to talk.

219
00:20:59,103 --> 00:21:01,003
I get out of the house once in a while.

220
00:21:01,205 --> 00:21:04,333
What about that guy Marty?
I figured he'd be right up your alley.

221
00:21:04,542 --> 00:21:06,237
From the fish market? No, thank you.

222
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:09,709
-Do I look that desperate to you?
-You want us to honestly answer?

223
00:21:12,183 --> 00:21:15,778
So I guess no news
from your father, huh?

224
00:21:16,687 --> 00:21:19,212
You'd be the first one I'd tell
if I heard from him.

225
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:21,085
Please don't start with that again.

226
00:21:21,258 --> 00:21:23,089
-Start with what?
-He left.

227
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:27,094
He ain't coming back. Trust me, I know
a little something about guys like this.

228
00:21:27,264 --> 00:21:28,856
Why would you say that?

229
00:21:29,033 --> 00:21:30,796
He did this when you were a baby.

230
00:21:30,968 --> 00:21:32,595
He came back then, didn't he?

231
00:21:32,937 --> 00:21:35,804
If he gave a shit about us,
he would've called already.

232
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:40,039
Even if that son of a bitch did call,
I wouldn't wanna talk to him.

233
00:21:40,211 --> 00:21:42,839
Watch your mouth.
He's still your father.

234
00:21:43,013 --> 00:21:44,605
Not to me, he's not.

235
00:21:44,782 --> 00:21:48,149
Why don't you take that fucking picture
off the wall already?

236
00:21:49,153 --> 00:21:51,246
Nice mouth, huh?

237
00:21:58,696 --> 00:22:02,462
This is pretty good.
You're finally getting the hang of it.

238
00:22:08,606 --> 00:22:10,597
What's the matter, babe?

239
00:22:12,176 --> 00:22:14,576
It's just my mom, you know?
She won't give up hope.

240
00:22:14,745 --> 00:22:16,679
It's tough to watch.

241
00:22:17,381 --> 00:22:18,609
I don't get your dad.

242
00:22:18,782 --> 00:22:22,582
I don't know how a guy can just run off
on his wife and kids like that.

243
00:22:22,753 --> 00:22:24,277
Yeah.

244
00:22:25,055 --> 00:22:28,616
-I can sort of understand why he left.
-You can?

245
00:22:28,792 --> 00:22:31,022
Yeah. He obviously
wasn't happy anymore.

246
00:22:31,195 --> 00:22:33,823
Where's it written
you gotta be happy all the time?

247
00:22:34,198 --> 00:22:36,291
He didn't love my mother.
What's he to do?

248
00:22:36,467 --> 00:22:39,300
-Spend his life being miserable?
-That's not the point.

249
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,734
We're talking about a guy
who abandoned his wife...

250
00:22:41,906 --> 00:22:44,067
...in the middle of the night,
no explanation.

251
00:22:44,241 --> 00:22:47,404
If he didn't love her anymore,
he should have asked for a divorce.

252
00:22:47,578 --> 00:22:50,445
He tried. But she wouldn't listen.

253
00:22:50,781 --> 00:22:53,272
She didn't wanna hear it,
didn't wanna believe it.

254
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:56,078
That's bullshit.
And why are you defending this guy?

255
00:22:56,287 --> 00:22:58,414
Can't you see
how it's affecting your mother?

256
00:22:58,589 --> 00:23:00,454
She hasn't left the house
in six months.

257
00:23:00,624 --> 00:23:02,023
I'm not defending him.

258
00:23:02,259 --> 00:23:04,727
I hate the son of a bitch
for what he's done to her.

259
00:23:04,895 --> 00:23:06,123
But he's my father...

260
00:23:06,297 --> 00:23:09,664
...and I grew up in that house,
so I can sort of understand his side.

261
00:23:10,734 --> 00:23:11,962
Well, I can't.

262
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,870
Yeah, well,
I wouldn't expect you to.

263
00:23:57,548 --> 00:24:00,779
Son of a bitch. Not again.

264
00:24:03,487 --> 00:24:07,389
So, man, what happened to that other
mechanic you were telling me about?

265
00:24:07,591 --> 00:24:09,286
He died.

266
00:24:09,793 --> 00:24:12,318
Look, I don't want you
to take this the wrong way.

267
00:24:12,496 --> 00:24:14,657
But that car you got?
A total piece of shit.

268
00:24:14,832 --> 00:24:17,323
Why don't you junk it
and save yourself the headache?

269
00:24:17,501 --> 00:24:19,935
Look who's talking.
What am I supposed to drive?

270
00:24:20,104 --> 00:24:22,504
Buy a new car.
You got the good job now.

271
00:24:22,673 --> 00:24:25,233
Do I look like I can buy a new car?

272
00:24:25,843 --> 00:24:28,676
Why don't you ask your old man
for a loan? He's got money.

273
00:24:28,846 --> 00:24:31,337
What do I look like?
I'm not gonna ask my parents.

274
00:24:31,515 --> 00:24:33,506
What's the big deal?
They're your parents.

275
00:24:33,684 --> 00:24:35,447
They're supposed to give you money.

276
00:24:35,619 --> 00:24:37,985
Maybe if I lived at home,
they'd make my bed too.

277
00:24:38,856 --> 00:24:41,848
Look, Michael, I don't know
if Claudia mentioned it at all...

278
00:24:42,026 --> 00:24:44,893
...but I stopped in at the diner
the other day for lunch...

279
00:24:45,062 --> 00:24:49,522
...and I happened to notice she didn't
have a ring on her finger, man.

280
00:24:50,868 --> 00:24:54,269
-What's up with that?
-It's because she doesn't have one.

281
00:24:54,471 --> 00:24:57,963
You know, I figure I'll buy her the ring
right after I buy that new car.

282
00:24:58,842 --> 00:25:03,211
-You guys are engaged though, right?
-Yes, like I told you.

283
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:06,543
We're just not gonna make it official
till we settle on a date.

284
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,581
Neither one of us is going anywhere.

285
00:25:08,786 --> 00:25:11,619
I gotta admit,
I'm a little jealous of you, you know.

286
00:25:11,855 --> 00:25:14,289
I'm starting to think
maybe that's what I gotta do.

287
00:25:14,458 --> 00:25:16,949
It's time to find a girl,
settle down, do that thing.

288
00:25:17,127 --> 00:25:18,424
Yeah, you should.

289
00:25:18,595 --> 00:25:22,292
Only problem is, it seems all the girls
I used to know around here...

290
00:25:22,466 --> 00:25:25,162
-...they're already spoken for, huh?
-That's right.

291
00:25:25,369 --> 00:25:30,102
-Don't forget it.
-Don't worry, man. I'm not about to.

292
00:25:32,076 --> 00:25:34,271
So you gonna help me out or what?

293
00:25:34,445 --> 00:25:37,005
Come on, you cheap bastard,
don't I always help you?

294
00:25:37,181 --> 00:25:40,116
All of a sudden I'm gonna stop
fixing your car for free?

295
00:25:40,284 --> 00:25:42,149
It died outside the house.

296
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:46,278
I don't know if you're cool with this,
but you'll have to come over to fix it.

297
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:50,688
Yeah, well, look, I got Saturday off.
I could maybe come by do it then?

298
00:25:50,861 --> 00:25:53,455
No, no, no, Saturday's no good.
I gotta work.

299
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:54,961
How about Sunday?

300
00:25:55,666 --> 00:26:00,501
Yeah. No, Sunday-- All right, yeah,
I'll come by-- I'll come by on Sunday.

301
00:27:00,864 --> 00:27:04,459
Hey, Michael. Mike, are you home?

302
00:27:09,273 --> 00:27:11,400
What the hell you are doing in here?

303
00:27:11,608 --> 00:27:13,303
Oh, hey, Claudia. How you doing?

304
00:27:14,077 --> 00:27:16,910
Don't ''How you doing?'' me.
What the fuck are you doing here?

305
00:27:18,382 --> 00:27:21,044
Hey, you know,
it's really nice to see you too.

306
00:27:21,251 --> 00:27:23,116
Nice place you got.

307
00:27:23,287 --> 00:27:26,552
I'm not joking, Charlie.
What are you doing in our house?

308
00:27:28,025 --> 00:27:29,720
I came by to see your boyfriend.

309
00:27:29,893 --> 00:27:31,918
I knocked on the door
and it was open--

310
00:27:32,095 --> 00:27:35,929
So you just let yourself in and started
helping yourself to our beer?

311
00:27:36,533 --> 00:27:39,161
Yeah. Yeah, looks like that.

312
00:27:39,336 --> 00:27:42,533
So is he around?

313
00:27:43,774 --> 00:27:47,335
No. He's at work.

314
00:27:47,511 --> 00:27:49,775
Why? What do you want him for?

315
00:27:50,013 --> 00:27:53,744
Well, didn't he tell you? I'm supposed
to come by today to fix the car.

316
00:27:54,918 --> 00:27:58,115
Yeah, he told me you were supposed
to come by tomorrow.

317
00:27:58,322 --> 00:28:00,620
Yeah, but see, I gotta work tomorrow.

318
00:28:00,824 --> 00:28:05,124
So I don't know, I figured I should
come by, see if I can do it today.

319
00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:07,826
You knew he wasn't
gonna be home today.

320
00:28:08,031 --> 00:28:11,330
No. No, I had no idea.

321
00:28:12,336 --> 00:28:14,099
I mean, I don't know, you know...

322
00:28:14,304 --> 00:28:17,034
...maybe, you know,
he may have mentioned it but--

323
00:28:17,241 --> 00:28:19,334
Then why don't you
just come back tomorrow...

324
00:28:19,576 --> 00:28:21,100
...like you said you were gonna?

325
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:24,611
Because I gotta cover
for The Foot tomorrow, all right?

326
00:28:24,781 --> 00:28:27,511
So if lover-boy wants
his car ready for Monday morning...

327
00:28:27,684 --> 00:28:29,174
...I can only do it today.

328
00:28:29,353 --> 00:28:31,082
So is this gonna be the routine now?

329
00:28:31,288 --> 00:28:33,313
You just hassle me
every chance you get?

330
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:38,689
Hassle you? Hassle you.
All right. Let me get this straight.

331
00:28:38,929 --> 00:28:43,298
I come over here on my day off
to fix your boyfriend's car...

332
00:28:43,467 --> 00:28:47,563
...for free, no less,
and you accuse me of hassling you?

333
00:28:47,771 --> 00:28:50,035
What do you think?
I got nothing better to do...

334
00:28:50,207 --> 00:28:52,368
...than come over
when Michael's not around...

335
00:28:52,576 --> 00:28:55,204
...and see if I can sweet-talk
you for a couple hours?

336
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,842
I mean, come on, Claudia,
you know I'm not that kind of guy.

337
00:29:00,817 --> 00:29:03,581
You're just not gonna give up,
are you?

338
00:29:03,954 --> 00:29:05,819
Hell, no.

339
00:29:10,594 --> 00:29:14,530
All right, look.
And don't laugh at this, all right?

340
00:29:15,032 --> 00:29:18,331
But when I was in California...

341
00:29:18,502 --> 00:29:24,998
...I got a chance to do a lot of thinking
about us and about how I took off...

342
00:29:28,612 --> 00:29:31,308
...and, you know, and about
how much I missed you.

343
00:29:32,316 --> 00:29:36,184
All right? So that's why I came home.

344
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,647
And that's why I'm hassling you.

345
00:29:42,926 --> 00:29:47,158
And that's why I'm probably
gonna continue to hassle you.

346
00:29:48,932 --> 00:29:51,400
Come on, you didn't miss me at all?

347
00:29:57,507 --> 00:29:59,737
Yeah, I missed you.

348
00:30:01,244 --> 00:30:03,405
Then what do you say?

349
00:30:05,682 --> 00:30:08,879
No, I'm not gonna feel like this again.

350
00:30:09,586 --> 00:30:13,181
-Hey, Claud, are you home?
-Yeah, Teresa. In here.

351
00:30:18,061 --> 00:30:19,392
Charlie.

352
00:30:21,098 --> 00:30:23,623
Hey, Teresa, how you doing?

353
00:30:23,967 --> 00:30:25,332
I'm fine.

354
00:30:25,736 --> 00:30:29,570
-How are you, keeping out of trouble?
-Yeah, yeah.

355
00:30:29,773 --> 00:30:33,038
Trying to convince your friend here
to change all that, but--

356
00:30:33,243 --> 00:30:35,734
He's just here to fix Michael's car.

357
00:30:35,912 --> 00:30:38,676
Yeah. Yeah, I'm here to fix the car.

358
00:30:41,218 --> 00:30:43,709
I'm gonna grab my beer
and get started out there.

359
00:30:43,887 --> 00:30:47,789
-Oh, yeah, help yourself.
-All right. Speak to you.

360
00:30:48,692 --> 00:30:51,092
All right, Teresa,
we'll see you at the bar.

361
00:30:58,402 --> 00:31:00,927
-So?
-So what?

362
00:31:01,571 --> 00:31:03,334
Don't pull that. What was going on?

363
00:31:03,507 --> 00:31:05,998
Nothing was going on.
He just came in to get a beer.

364
00:31:06,176 --> 00:31:08,440
Claudia, it was obvious
something was going on.

365
00:31:08,612 --> 00:31:10,273
Teresa, we were just talking.

366
00:31:10,447 --> 00:31:12,881
If I were you,
I wouldn't even give him that much.

367
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:16,219
Yeah? Well, you're not me, are you?

368
00:31:28,932 --> 00:31:30,991
Take a break.

369
00:31:38,175 --> 00:31:40,609
Can we get another round, please?

370
00:32:16,179 --> 00:32:19,512
-Hey, Claudia.
-Hey, Alice.

371
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:25,019
So I heard that Charlie's been doing
lunch over at the diner a lot these days.

372
00:32:25,188 --> 00:32:28,783
-What's up with that?
-Nothing's up with that.

373
00:32:28,992 --> 00:32:31,324
Oh, really? People are talking.

374
00:32:31,528 --> 00:32:34,088
Yeah? Well,
you shouldn't listen to them.

375
00:32:34,264 --> 00:32:36,425
I mean, how long ago
did you guys break up?

376
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,931
About two weeks ago.

377
00:32:38,101 --> 00:32:40,160
-Really?
-Yeah.

378
00:32:40,403 --> 00:32:42,098
You seeing anybody else right now?

379
00:32:42,339 --> 00:32:45,206
-No, not yet.
-That's good.

380
00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:48,334
You wouldn't wanna rush
into something right away...

381
00:32:48,512 --> 00:32:53,381
...you know, get into something crazy,
I don't know, I mean, would you?

382
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:57,281
Can you believe that slut? I don't know
what he was thinking, marrying her.

383
00:32:57,454 --> 00:33:01,083
I'll tell you what. Her father gave him
a job. Couldn't get one on his own.

384
00:33:01,258 --> 00:33:02,850
Bullshit. He got her pregnant.

385
00:33:03,026 --> 00:33:06,291
Her father threatened to cut his balls off
if he didn't marry her.

386
00:33:06,463 --> 00:33:08,590
-Can you see it?
-No.

387
00:33:08,832 --> 00:33:11,528
No, turn it this way.

388
00:33:12,569 --> 00:33:15,732
Oh, yeah. Look at that.
He's got a little one, huh?

389
00:33:15,939 --> 00:33:20,103
-Yeah, takes after his father.
-Sorry.

390
00:33:20,277 --> 00:33:21,608
He comes over on Saturday...

391
00:33:21,778 --> 00:33:24,941
...when I told him to come by on
Sunday to fix the car, you know?

392
00:33:25,115 --> 00:33:28,573
-Did he fix the car?
-That's not the point, Goldie.

393
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:31,114
He said himself,
he wouldn't do anything.

394
00:33:31,354 --> 00:33:33,288
Oh, I feel much better now.

395
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:36,084
Hey, can we have a couple of shots?

396
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,551
-Tony from the pizza place is here.
-So?

397
00:33:39,729 --> 00:33:41,890
What ''so''?
So he broke up with his girlfriend.

398
00:33:42,065 --> 00:33:45,057
-I'm thinking maybe, you know....
-What?

399
00:33:45,368 --> 00:33:47,359
Do you guys have any rubbers on you?

400
00:33:47,537 --> 00:33:49,630
-Hear who moved in on State Street?
-I know.

401
00:33:49,806 --> 00:33:51,774
The O'Hara's sold their house
to them.

402
00:33:51,942 --> 00:33:54,740
That neighborhood's captured territory.
It's a shame.

403
00:33:54,911 --> 00:33:58,142
I give my mother a week
before she's got her house up for sale.

404
00:33:58,315 --> 00:34:01,250
All right, but tell me, why'd
he have to come into my house?

405
00:34:01,418 --> 00:34:04,785
Mikey, the guy, he's--
He's fixing your car for free.

406
00:34:04,988 --> 00:34:08,082
I'd say not out of whack
for him to come in and ask for a beer.

407
00:34:08,258 --> 00:34:10,089
There's something going on
in his head.

408
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,524
I just wonder if he tried anything
with Claudia.

409
00:34:12,696 --> 00:34:14,527
Don't you think she would tell you?

410
00:34:14,698 --> 00:34:16,666
-Yeah, I do.
-Of course she would.

411
00:34:36,353 --> 00:34:37,650
What's happening, fellas?

412
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,798
There they are.
How you doing, gentlemen?

413
00:34:48,965 --> 00:34:50,865
-Hello, Charlie.
-Charlie, how you doing?

414
00:34:51,067 --> 00:34:53,968
What's up, guys?
Guys, look, I want to meet....

415
00:34:55,071 --> 00:34:56,368
Annie, right? Annie.

416
00:34:56,539 --> 00:34:59,235
Annie, this is Michael and Goldie.
My two oldest friends.

417
00:34:59,442 --> 00:35:01,535
Probably his only friends.
Nice to meet you.

418
00:35:01,711 --> 00:35:04,202
I've known these guys
since I was younger than you.

419
00:35:04,381 --> 00:35:05,848
So be nice to them, all right?

420
00:35:06,049 --> 00:35:09,246
Annie. It's very,
very nice to meet you.

421
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,814
Control yourself, Goldie, all right?
You're a married man.

422
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,719
I'm sorry, Charlie.

423
00:35:15,892 --> 00:35:19,259
So, what's up? I come over,
fix the car, I don't get a thank-you call?

424
00:35:19,462 --> 00:35:22,625
No, thanks. I thought you were
coming over on Sunday, that's all.

425
00:35:22,799 --> 00:35:24,266
Yeah, didn't Claudia tell you?

426
00:35:24,467 --> 00:35:27,265
I was gonna come Sunday,
but I had to cover for The Foot...

427
00:35:27,437 --> 00:35:30,463
...so I figured Saturday was cool,
I hope that was all right.

428
00:35:30,674 --> 00:35:32,904
No, no, problem.
Just call us next time.

429
00:35:33,576 --> 00:35:35,601
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

430
00:35:35,779 --> 00:35:38,475
Hey, what are you doing next week?
You're on for poker?

431
00:35:39,049 --> 00:35:43,008
Yeah, I'll be there. I'll be there.
What about you, Mikey, gonna show?

432
00:35:43,186 --> 00:35:45,552
No, I'm definitely in.

433
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:48,855
Hey, I'll be right back.

434
00:35:49,025 --> 00:35:50,925
I just have to go
to the bathroom, okay?

435
00:35:51,094 --> 00:35:53,722
Yeah. Just don't take all night,
all right, sweetheart?

436
00:35:53,897 --> 00:35:56,127
-Okay.
-You guys want drinks? Come on, Mikey.

437
00:35:56,299 --> 00:35:58,290
-No. I'm good.
-Charlie, what do you want?

438
00:35:58,501 --> 00:35:59,866
Yeah. You know what? Get me--

439
00:36:00,036 --> 00:36:02,061
Get me, like, two shots
for her, all right?

440
00:36:02,405 --> 00:36:05,101
Mary, three shots of Jack, please.

441
00:36:05,275 --> 00:36:08,267
Charlie, where did you find her?

442
00:36:08,445 --> 00:36:11,278
I know, can you believe it?
Is she fucking hot or what?

443
00:36:11,448 --> 00:36:13,746
You ain't gonna
take her home tonight, are you?

444
00:36:13,917 --> 00:36:16,078
What do you mean?
Of course I'll take her home.

445
00:36:16,252 --> 00:36:19,710
-You know, if her mother's not home.
-She's jailbait, for chrissake.

446
00:36:19,889 --> 00:36:22,323
You should be buying her
ice cream cones, not shots.

447
00:36:22,726 --> 00:36:25,388
What are you talking about?
She's a freshman in college.

448
00:36:25,562 --> 00:36:28,292
I even saw her lD, right?
So it's legal, right?

449
00:36:28,465 --> 00:36:31,298
You know, in some southern states,
Charlie, it is legal.

450
00:36:31,468 --> 00:36:33,493
I'm out of here.

451
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:35,934
What's with him?
All of a sudden, he's a saint?

452
00:36:36,439 --> 00:36:39,431
Don't worry about him.
Let's do these shots.

453
00:36:39,943 --> 00:36:42,309
-Cheers.
-All right.

454
00:36:42,645 --> 00:36:44,613
To young girls.

455
00:37:01,564 --> 00:37:04,965
-Wait a second.
-What? Something wrong?

456
00:37:05,135 --> 00:37:09,435
No, I-- We just shouldn't be doing this
out here. Somebody might see us.

457
00:37:09,606 --> 00:37:13,406
Well, then, what do you say--?
What do you say we go inside?

458
00:37:13,576 --> 00:37:16,101
I told you we can't.
My parents are home.

459
00:37:16,279 --> 00:37:19,146
-Your parents are home?
-Yeah.

460
00:37:19,315 --> 00:37:23,547
Well, look, I'm kind of tapped out,
but you got any money?

461
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,450
-Or, like, a credit card on you?
-Yeah.

462
00:37:26,623 --> 00:37:29,956
Well, then, what do you say
we go find a motel room?

463
00:37:32,095 --> 00:37:34,063
I don't-- I don't know.

464
00:37:35,198 --> 00:37:38,361
What do you mean, you don't know?
Is something wrong?

465
00:37:38,535 --> 00:37:40,799
No, I-- No.

466
00:37:41,004 --> 00:37:45,873
I'm just-- I'm not sure I'm ready
to do this right now, that's all.

467
00:37:46,109 --> 00:37:48,202
What, are you afraid of me?

468
00:37:48,411 --> 00:37:50,003
I mean, look at me.

469
00:37:50,213 --> 00:37:52,374
Look at me.
I'm a fucking pussycat over here.

470
00:37:52,549 --> 00:37:54,779
I'm not gonna hurt you. Come on.

471
00:37:58,354 --> 00:38:01,949
It's almost 5.
My parents are gonna be up soon.

472
00:38:03,426 --> 00:38:05,519
So, what are you saying to me?

473
00:38:06,262 --> 00:38:09,390
It's time to go home?
You calling it a night?

474
00:38:10,366 --> 00:38:13,893
I'm gonna be back home
in a couple weeks for spring break.

475
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:16,067
Maybe we could wait till then.

476
00:38:16,673 --> 00:38:19,369
-Spring break?
-Yeah.

477
00:38:20,743 --> 00:38:25,544
Yeah, yeah. You know what?
I'll be waiting by the phone.

478
00:38:29,452 --> 00:38:31,545
Okay. Bye.

479
00:38:39,796 --> 00:38:42,765
-Kelly, where are you?
-Hold your freaking horses, I'm coming.

480
00:38:42,932 --> 00:38:44,797
Did she show you
what she's gonna wear?

481
00:38:44,968 --> 00:38:49,701
-Jeez, she looks like a frigging hooker.
-Ma, don't start with her tonight.

482
00:38:50,773 --> 00:38:53,071
-What do you think?
-Oh, my God.

483
00:38:53,276 --> 00:38:54,868
What?

484
00:38:55,578 --> 00:38:58,411
-You look beautiful.
-You really do, Kelly. You look great.

485
00:38:58,615 --> 00:39:02,073
-Yeah? You don't think it's too much?
-If you got it, work it, baby.

486
00:39:02,252 --> 00:39:04,743
I figure a night out
with Marty the fishmonger...

487
00:39:04,921 --> 00:39:07,617
...has got to be better
than another night with you, Ma.

488
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:09,917
-What do you think?
-You look like a floozy.

489
00:39:10,093 --> 00:39:12,584
But you've been dressing like this
since you're 1 3.

490
00:39:12,762 --> 00:39:15,162
You didn't give a crap
what I thought then either.

491
00:39:15,331 --> 00:39:18,926
Oh, don't say that, Ma.
You know I care what you think.

492
00:39:19,102 --> 00:39:21,002
Get the hell out of here.

493
00:39:21,237 --> 00:39:23,330
-So where you guys going?
-Casa Tina's.

494
00:39:23,506 --> 00:39:26,703
Casa Tina's? That's expensive.
This guy must make some coin.

495
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:29,105
Hey, he's got his own shop.

496
00:39:29,746 --> 00:39:33,011
-That's him.
-We got Mr. Manners here too, huh?

497
00:39:33,216 --> 00:39:35,309
Doesn't even come to the door
to say hello.

498
00:39:35,485 --> 00:39:37,578
What, are you embarrassed
about your family?

499
00:39:37,754 --> 00:39:40,552
He's afraid of you, Ma.
He's heard the stories.

500
00:39:40,723 --> 00:39:44,284
-So, what do you think?
-I think you're gonna have a great time.

501
00:39:44,727 --> 00:39:46,854
Can you believe I'm actually nervous?

502
00:39:47,096 --> 00:39:50,224
-Do I look all right?
-Don't worry. You look beautiful.

503
00:39:50,433 --> 00:39:54,426
-Now go have a good time.
-All right, thank you.

504
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:58,867
-I love you, babe.
-Love you too.

505
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:22,298
So how's everything
with you and Michael?

506
00:40:22,465 --> 00:40:24,626
Everything all right?

507
00:40:24,834 --> 00:40:26,893
Yeah, everything's cool. Why?

508
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:32,768
No reason. Just, you know, making sure.
Because I like Mike.

509
00:40:32,976 --> 00:40:34,841
He's a good man.

510
00:40:35,011 --> 00:40:37,206
-Yeah, well, everything's fine.
-Good.

511
00:40:37,413 --> 00:40:39,210
I'm gonna go sit down now,
okay, Tony?

512
00:40:39,415 --> 00:40:40,905
All right.

513
00:40:41,084 --> 00:40:43,575
If you need anything, let me know.

514
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,749
I'll be here.

515
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:50,525
So, what do you think of him?
Do you think he's cute?

516
00:40:50,994 --> 00:40:52,552
He's not really my type.

517
00:40:52,795 --> 00:40:56,322
I used to think
he was sexy in high school.

518
00:40:57,033 --> 00:40:59,558
-I mean, he had hair back then.
-So ask him out.

519
00:40:59,802 --> 00:41:03,499
I tried the other night at the bar,
but he didn't get the hint.

520
00:41:03,706 --> 00:41:07,574
I think he got back with his ex-girlfriend
and I wouldn't feel right about that.

521
00:41:07,744 --> 00:41:10,042
Let's say you're sitting
home alone one night...

522
00:41:10,213 --> 00:41:12,147
...and you decide to order a pizza.

523
00:41:12,315 --> 00:41:16,046
And our man Anthony shows up.
Do you invite him in?

524
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,614
Do I invite him in?
In a heartbeat, I invite him in.

525
00:41:19,789 --> 00:41:22,280
Okay. So you invite him in.
Now what do you do?

526
00:41:23,226 --> 00:41:25,126
Do I think he's into me?

527
00:41:26,129 --> 00:41:28,757
Oh, yeah, he wants you, you can tell.

528
00:41:28,931 --> 00:41:30,762
Okay.

529
00:41:31,134 --> 00:41:32,658
Then I make my move.

530
00:41:33,536 --> 00:41:35,868
-And?
-And....

531
00:41:36,072 --> 00:41:39,064
And what? Do I have sex with him?

532
00:41:39,876 --> 00:41:41,776
-Yeah.
-Yeah, well, if I'm gonna do it...

533
00:41:41,944 --> 00:41:43,969
...I'm gonna do it right, right?

534
00:42:13,115 --> 00:42:15,777
Hey, Foot, tell me...

535
00:42:16,018 --> 00:42:19,283
...what the hell is a guy your age
still doing here pumping gas?

536
00:42:19,488 --> 00:42:22,252
Making the rent, same as you.

537
00:42:22,692 --> 00:42:24,182
Hey, pal, look, all right?

538
00:42:24,393 --> 00:42:26,156
Don't go comparing your life to mine.

539
00:42:26,429 --> 00:42:28,624
I ain't here making the frigging rent.

540
00:42:28,931 --> 00:42:31,593
Yo, Bugs, I'm gonna grab some lunch,
all right?

541
00:42:31,801 --> 00:42:33,769
Charlie, you gotta be kidding me.

542
00:42:33,969 --> 00:42:35,766
You got 40 minutes, I'm timing you.

543
00:42:35,971 --> 00:42:37,836
All right. Thanks.

544
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:41,271
Look, I'm gonna grab some lunch.
You want me to get you anything?

545
00:42:42,712 --> 00:42:44,612
Very nice.

546
00:43:49,111 --> 00:43:51,079
What's that smile about, huh?

547
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,510
You just come back
from the junior high school?

548
00:43:53,682 --> 00:43:56,276
Hey. She was in college, all right?

549
00:43:56,519 --> 00:43:59,920
-Besides, I just drove her home.
-Oh, I'm sure you did.

550
00:44:00,122 --> 00:44:01,749
Want a beer?

551
00:44:03,526 --> 00:44:05,016
Okay.

552
00:44:06,629 --> 00:44:08,790
Look, I'm telling you,
nothing happened, okay?

553
00:44:08,998 --> 00:44:11,432
I mean, I drove her home...

554
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:15,366
...maybe there was, you know,
a little kiss, and that's it.

555
00:44:15,571 --> 00:44:18,233
Why? You-- You jealous or something?

556
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,805
Why would I be jealous?

557
00:44:20,109 --> 00:44:23,306
No reason. I mean,
but if you are jealous, I can understand.

558
00:44:23,512 --> 00:44:27,141
Because I'm sure it was a little weird
for you to see me with another woman.

559
00:44:27,383 --> 00:44:30,113
Especially a fine young thing
like that, right?

560
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:34,221
Well, I suppose if I thought she were out
of the 10th grade, I might be jealous.

561
00:44:34,423 --> 00:44:39,486
Hey, hey, she was in college, okay?
I mean, I saw her lD.

562
00:44:39,662 --> 00:44:41,357
Well, I hope so, for your sake.

563
00:44:48,237 --> 00:44:51,798
If l remember correctly,
you kind of like this song, don't you?

564
00:44:53,642 --> 00:44:56,577
Yeah, you know, I like all his stuff.

565
00:44:56,779 --> 00:45:02,684
Well, then what do you say
you give me a little-- A little dance?

566
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:04,947
What, in here?

567
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,987
Yeah, come on, you know,
a little slow dance.

568
00:45:08,157 --> 00:45:10,853
What are you talking about?
You don't know how to dance.

569
00:45:11,093 --> 00:45:12,526
I don't know how to dance?

570
00:45:12,695 --> 00:45:16,688
First of all, it's a slow dance and any
retard knows how to do a slow dance.

571
00:45:16,932 --> 00:45:19,332
And besides,
you don't remember our prom?

572
00:45:19,501 --> 00:45:21,128
We did some dancing that night.

573
00:45:21,303 --> 00:45:23,703
Sorry, I can't.

574
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:29,873
I don't know, it seemed the other day
at your house you felt like dancing.

575
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:31,637
What happened to that?

576
00:45:32,715 --> 00:45:35,081
Yeah, well, we all make mistakes.

577
00:45:36,452 --> 00:45:38,613
So, what are you trying to say?

578
00:45:39,088 --> 00:45:41,022
You hate me or something?

579
00:45:42,658 --> 00:45:45,559
No, I'm just not dancing with you.

580
00:45:47,897 --> 00:45:50,525
All right, all right.

581
00:45:52,134 --> 00:45:54,625
I guess I'll go back to work then, huh?

582
00:45:55,471 --> 00:45:57,234
Guess so.

583
00:46:00,242 --> 00:46:01,971
Enjoy the beer.

584
00:46:02,144 --> 00:46:03,907
Thank you.

585
00:46:07,917 --> 00:46:09,748
Hey, Claudia.

586
00:46:11,487 --> 00:46:14,388
I told you you'd be cleaning
his dirty underwear, didn't l?

587
00:47:23,225 --> 00:47:25,455
-You okay?
-Yeah.

588
00:47:25,627 --> 00:47:29,427
-You sure?
-Yeah, I said I'm fine.

589
00:47:29,598 --> 00:47:32,328
What, you don't wanna go to the bar
and watch the game?

590
00:47:32,501 --> 00:47:35,197
No, forget it, it's fine.

591
00:47:37,106 --> 00:47:40,769
We don't have to go to the bar. We can
go to my mother's and get a nice meal.

592
00:47:40,943 --> 00:47:42,604
Everybody's gonna be there tonight.

593
00:47:42,778 --> 00:47:45,576
Couldn't we go into the city
and go to a nice restaurant?

594
00:47:45,781 --> 00:47:48,807
I just told you I can barely afford
to pay our bills...

595
00:47:48,984 --> 00:47:51,350
...and you want to go to the city
to a restaurant?

596
00:47:51,587 --> 00:47:54,954
Yeah. We haven't left this town
to do anything in over a year.

597
00:47:55,157 --> 00:47:58,024
It might be nice to see
different faces, different streets.

598
00:47:58,227 --> 00:48:00,422
Every time we go
over to your mother's house...

599
00:48:00,596 --> 00:48:02,621
...you end up sitting
watching football...

600
00:48:02,798 --> 00:48:04,663
...while your mother
and your sisters...

601
00:48:04,833 --> 00:48:07,358
...trap me and ask me
when we're gonna get married.

602
00:48:07,536 --> 00:48:09,595
-No, they don't.
-Yes, they do. Every time.

603
00:48:09,772 --> 00:48:11,831
And what do you say to them?

604
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:13,941
The same thing I always say to you.

605
00:48:14,143 --> 00:48:16,737
Yeah, which is bullshit.

606
00:48:17,012 --> 00:48:19,503
-Please don't start with me.
-Don't start with what?

607
00:48:19,681 --> 00:48:22,946
I'm not gonna wait till I'm old
to get married. I'm ready for this.

608
00:48:23,118 --> 00:48:26,554
I know you're ready. In fact, everyone
we know knows how ready you are.

609
00:48:26,789 --> 00:48:29,189
We've been together forever.
What do you want?

610
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:31,986
I don't know.
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

611
00:48:32,161 --> 00:48:34,652
-You don't want to hear that.
-It doesn't make sense.

612
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:36,297
We're not getting any younger.

613
00:48:36,465 --> 00:48:39,059
I mean, when do you think
you're gonna wanna do this?

614
00:48:39,635 --> 00:48:42,399
I just don't wanna rush into it,
Michael.

615
00:48:43,172 --> 00:48:45,800
What am I doing here?
Am I just wasting time?

616
00:48:46,008 --> 00:48:48,203
If I am, tell me,
so I can get on with my life.

617
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:50,002
Why do you insist on hounding me?

618
00:48:50,179 --> 00:48:51,976
I'm not hounding you. I'm just--

619
00:48:52,147 --> 00:48:55,674
Yes, you are! Because we have
this same conversation every week.

620
00:48:55,851 --> 00:48:59,651
I don't wanna go to your mother's
house and I'm not ready to get married.

621
00:48:59,822 --> 00:49:02,848
-Why not?
-I'm not ready to become a housewife.

622
00:49:03,025 --> 00:49:05,323
-Who says you gotta be?
-What else would I be?

623
00:49:05,494 --> 00:49:07,724
Tell me what else would I be
if we got married.

624
00:49:07,896 --> 00:49:11,525
-What would I do with my life?
-I don't know.

625
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,027
That is exactly my point. Neither do l.

626
00:49:21,543 --> 00:49:23,511
Does she know about this?

627
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:26,842
Oh, ladies, this is my lucky day.

628
00:49:27,049 --> 00:49:31,850
Goldie, I'll see your 50 cents
and I will raise you two bucks.

629
00:49:32,054 --> 00:49:36,514
Oh, Mikey, Mikey. All right.
You sure you can afford this?

630
00:49:36,725 --> 00:49:38,556
Don't you worry about me, Goldie.

631
00:49:38,727 --> 00:49:41,662
Good, because I can't. I'm out.

632
00:49:42,364 --> 00:49:43,922
You in or out?

633
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,964
Look at Mikey over here
playing the big spender.

634
00:49:47,202 --> 00:49:48,760
Yeah, I'm in, tough nuts.

635
00:49:48,971 --> 00:49:54,568
I see your two dollars
and I raise you...

636
00:49:57,146 --> 00:49:58,738
...20. Think you can handle that?

637
00:49:58,914 --> 00:50:01,314
-We don't play for those kind of stakes.
-Come on.

638
00:50:01,483 --> 00:50:04,418
What are you doing?
We don't play for that kind of cash.

639
00:50:04,586 --> 00:50:07,555
He's sitting here grinning
like the big man with the big hand.

640
00:50:07,723 --> 00:50:10,783
I thought I'd give you a chance
to show us how big you are.

641
00:50:10,959 --> 00:50:12,449
Don't be an asshole, come on.

642
00:50:13,262 --> 00:50:14,923
You can always fold, big man.

643
00:50:17,666 --> 00:50:19,634
Goldie, loan me 20 bucks.

644
00:50:19,935 --> 00:50:23,098
Mikey, you're into me for 40 already.

645
00:50:23,272 --> 00:50:25,968
Have I not paid you back?
Come on, loan me 20 bucks.

646
00:50:27,075 --> 00:50:28,508
All right.

647
00:50:28,977 --> 00:50:30,205
All right.

648
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,145
All right, Charlie, show me your hand.

649
00:50:34,283 --> 00:50:36,478
I hate to do this to you,
because I know--

650
00:50:36,652 --> 00:50:39,485
I know times are tough and all...

651
00:50:39,655 --> 00:50:41,782
...but it's a full house.

652
00:50:47,796 --> 00:50:51,357
-You're still a fucking scumbag.
-I don't know what to tell you, Michael.

653
00:50:51,533 --> 00:50:55,196
All your life, I've been beating you.
You thought that was gonna change?

654
00:50:56,438 --> 00:50:58,338
-Don't be a dick.
-He can't help himself.

655
00:50:58,507 --> 00:51:00,236
You should've stayed in California.

656
00:51:00,909 --> 00:51:03,343
I'm breaking your balls a little bit,
all right?

657
00:51:03,512 --> 00:51:05,241
Don't turn into a mary on us, okay?

658
00:51:05,414 --> 00:51:07,405
Guys, can we chill out
and play cards?

659
00:51:07,616 --> 00:51:09,345
Hey, Charlie, take it easy.

660
00:51:09,818 --> 00:51:11,217
Don't push me, Charlie, okay?

661
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:14,389
Man, I'm not pushing you at all,
all right? I'm playing cards.

662
00:51:14,556 --> 00:51:17,423
You can't take it, hit the bricks.

663
00:51:18,427 --> 00:51:21,555
-Fine. I'm out of here.
-Hey, Mikey, come on, man. Don't--

664
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:24,164
-I'll lend you some money, don't worry.
-Fuck him.

665
00:51:24,333 --> 00:51:27,734
You know what? This ain't high school
anymore. You're fucking nothing.

666
00:51:30,505 --> 00:51:33,906
And another thing, keep the fuck away
from Claudia, all right?

667
00:51:37,045 --> 00:51:38,535
It's late.

668
00:51:38,981 --> 00:51:40,972
See you tomorrow, Goldie.

669
00:51:46,021 --> 00:51:47,249
You see this?

670
00:51:47,456 --> 00:51:50,721
I fix the guy's car for free,
this is the thanks I get, right?

671
00:51:51,593 --> 00:51:55,359
You're fucked up.
Why are you doing this?

672
00:51:56,665 --> 00:51:59,725
-What is that suppose to mean?
-Why don't you tell me?

673
00:52:00,335 --> 00:52:03,862
If I knew what you were talking about,
I could help you out, but I don't.

674
00:52:04,339 --> 00:52:06,398
Okay, Charlie.

675
00:52:07,376 --> 00:52:09,606
Is something going on
with you and Claudia?

676
00:52:11,113 --> 00:52:12,876
No. Why?

677
00:52:13,982 --> 00:52:16,473
-People are talking, Charlie.
-People are talking?

678
00:52:16,652 --> 00:52:19,212
Because that's all
there is to do in this town.

679
00:52:19,388 --> 00:52:21,253
Charlie, you can't do it to her.

680
00:52:21,490 --> 00:52:25,483
You can't come back and start screwing
with her head again. It just ain't right.

681
00:52:25,661 --> 00:52:28,892
Hey, who says I'm screwing
with her head, all right?

682
00:52:29,097 --> 00:52:32,294
Let's say the only reason I came home
is because I wanna see her.

683
00:52:32,501 --> 00:52:34,969
I show up to find my best friend
is living with her.

684
00:52:35,137 --> 00:52:37,731
What am I supposed to do?
Pack my bags and take off?

685
00:52:37,906 --> 00:52:40,238
I mean, that sounds fair to you?

686
00:52:41,376 --> 00:52:43,105
So, what are you gonna tell me?

687
00:52:43,312 --> 00:52:46,611
You're still in love with her
after all these years?

688
00:52:49,017 --> 00:52:50,746
Maybe I am.

689
00:53:07,469 --> 00:53:10,267
-What happened?
-She's all right. She's fine, thank God.

690
00:53:10,439 --> 00:53:12,669
The doctor came by
a little while ago.

691
00:53:12,908 --> 00:53:15,741
He said there's nothing wrong with her,
she just collapsed.

692
00:53:15,944 --> 00:53:17,969
She's upstairs sleeping now, finally.

693
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:19,977
So, what was it?

694
00:53:20,582 --> 00:53:22,345
Dad called.

695
00:53:26,121 --> 00:53:28,612
He is such a piece of shit.

696
00:53:31,993 --> 00:53:33,961
You wanna know why he called?

697
00:53:34,162 --> 00:53:35,925
He's in love and he's found himself.

698
00:53:36,131 --> 00:53:40,591
Oh, yeah, and he wanted to tell Ma
that she can have the fucking house.

699
00:53:40,802 --> 00:53:42,326
He's living down in Vegas now...

700
00:53:42,504 --> 00:53:45,632
...and he says
he's not gonna call us anymore...

701
00:53:45,807 --> 00:53:48,275
...and doesn't wanna
hear from us neither.

702
00:53:51,213 --> 00:53:54,205
I told you he never gave a shit
about us.

703
00:53:56,618 --> 00:53:59,485
I hope he fucking dies tomorrow.

704
00:54:02,891 --> 00:54:05,655
When she was on the phone with him,
she just sat there...

705
00:54:05,861 --> 00:54:08,955
...just listening to him,
not saying nothing.

706
00:54:10,232 --> 00:54:13,963
And then she hung up the phone,
reaI calm, you know...

707
00:54:14,336 --> 00:54:16,463
...told me what he said...

708
00:54:17,239 --> 00:54:18,831
...and then she just went to bed.

709
00:54:19,007 --> 00:54:21,840
I woke up this morning to go to Mass,
she was still asleep.

710
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:25,343
So I-- You know,
I thought she was fine.

711
00:54:26,481 --> 00:54:30,247
And then I come home and I found her
sprawled out on the floor.

712
00:54:42,197 --> 00:54:44,165
Oh, hi, baby.

713
00:54:44,366 --> 00:54:46,926
-How you doing?
-I'm okay.

714
00:54:47,169 --> 00:54:50,627
I mean, you know,
it's no big deal, I fell down.

715
00:54:55,577 --> 00:54:58,546
You always were my beautiful baby.

716
00:54:59,581 --> 00:55:04,177
Hey, don't you cry
about a thing, huh?

717
00:55:05,687 --> 00:55:08,053
I told you he's done this before.

718
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:12,924
You'll see, he'll be home soon.

719
00:55:13,161 --> 00:55:14,992
You'll see.

720
00:55:15,163 --> 00:55:17,028
Okay?

721
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,800
Yeah, okay.

722
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:28,903
You get out of here now,
let me take a nap.

723
00:55:29,377 --> 00:55:33,074
-Go on.
-Okay.

724
00:57:45,914 --> 00:57:48,940
I was wondering when you'd find
the time to come by, say hello.

725
00:57:49,117 --> 00:57:50,948
How you doing, Charlie?

726
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:54,919
Same old, same old.
What's up? You need some gas?

727
00:57:55,090 --> 00:57:57,991
Yeah. Fill me up. Regular.

728
00:57:58,927 --> 00:58:00,918
Yeah, I'll fill you up.

729
00:58:19,547 --> 00:58:23,415
-So...?
-Listen, I wanted to talk to you.

730
00:58:23,585 --> 00:58:26,179
Do you think we could,
you know, go somewhere to talk?

731
00:58:26,921 --> 00:58:29,788
Sure, is everything--?
Everything's all right?

732
00:58:29,958 --> 00:58:32,984
Yeah, everything's fine.
I just wanna talk.

733
00:58:33,595 --> 00:58:36,792
-Can you get a few minutes?
-Yeah, I can get a few minutes.

734
00:58:36,965 --> 00:58:38,990
Give me a second, all right?

735
00:58:44,639 --> 00:58:46,436
Hey, Bugs, I'm out of here, okay?

736
00:58:46,608 --> 00:58:49,668
Hey, Charlie,
get over here first, will you?

737
00:58:51,346 --> 00:58:52,574
Hey, man, what's up?

738
00:58:52,747 --> 00:58:55,944
Jimbo's leaving at the end of the month,
leaving me high and dry.

739
00:58:56,117 --> 00:58:59,109
I'm gonna need somebody
full-time at this point...

740
00:58:59,287 --> 00:59:03,223
...so if you give me 30 hours a week
built, you're the man for the job.

741
00:59:06,127 --> 00:59:09,688
I don't know. Give me a little time
to think about it?

742
00:59:09,864 --> 00:59:12,890
Yeah, just don't jerk me on it.
Let me know as soon as you can.

743
00:59:13,068 --> 00:59:16,560
Yeah. Thanks, man.

744
00:59:21,409 --> 00:59:25,175
Look at you, huh?
The happy brown bagger.

745
00:59:25,447 --> 00:59:27,347
Take it easy, Foot.

746
00:59:42,997 --> 00:59:45,227
You think we screwed up?

747
00:59:45,433 --> 00:59:47,230
Is this how
we were supposed to end up?

748
00:59:47,402 --> 00:59:51,236
Why would you say ''end up''? You're
talking like your life's already over.

749
00:59:52,874 --> 00:59:55,206
I feel it closing in.

750
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:57,740
It's always something.

751
01:00:00,949 --> 01:00:04,646
I mean, look at my dad.
I think that's why he left.

752
01:00:04,819 --> 01:00:08,846
Claudia, I mean, if you really feel
that way, why don't--?

753
01:00:09,557 --> 01:00:12,458
You know, why don't you just
come away with me when I go?

754
01:00:13,061 --> 01:00:15,859
Come on, Charlie,
you know I can't do that.

755
01:00:16,064 --> 01:00:18,658
No, you know what? I don't know.

756
01:00:19,234 --> 01:00:20,826
Why not? Why not come with me?

757
01:00:21,402 --> 01:00:23,734
What's keeping you here?

758
01:00:26,908 --> 01:00:31,277
Because you really hurt me last time
and I don't wanna go through that again.

759
01:00:39,554 --> 01:00:41,181
Hey.

760
01:00:42,257 --> 01:00:44,282
Look, all right?

761
01:00:44,459 --> 01:00:47,895
I promise you
I'm not gonna hurt you again.

762
01:00:54,302 --> 01:00:57,430
I know how badly
I screwed up last time.

763
01:00:57,605 --> 01:01:00,938
I mean, why do you think
I was in such a hurry to get out of here?

764
01:01:02,610 --> 01:01:06,569
But it's, you know, it's different now.

765
01:01:07,916 --> 01:01:09,281
How?

766
01:01:10,084 --> 01:01:12,018
I guess this time--

767
01:01:12,587 --> 01:01:14,953
I mean, this time I need you.

768
01:01:15,123 --> 01:01:18,752
And I love you.

769
01:01:22,397 --> 01:01:24,456
Promise me
you're not messing with my head.

770
01:01:25,133 --> 01:01:29,570
Yeah. Yeah, I promise you.

771
01:01:55,763 --> 01:01:59,426
-Here you go.
-Oh, thank you, sweetheart. That'll help.

772
01:02:06,341 --> 01:02:08,707
Want me to fix you
something really good to eat?

773
01:02:08,877 --> 01:02:13,337
-No, this will do just fine for now.
-Okay.

774
01:02:19,354 --> 01:02:21,322
What are you so chipper about, huh?

775
01:02:21,656 --> 01:02:24,819
-Your poor mother lying here half-dead?
-Ma, don't talk like that.

776
01:02:24,993 --> 01:02:28,622
I don't even know what you're saying.
I'm not ''chipper.''

777
01:02:28,796 --> 01:02:30,229
Oh, yeah?

778
01:02:30,999 --> 01:02:33,695
What's that smile on your face
all about?

779
01:02:36,237 --> 01:02:38,671
I don't know. Just stuff.

780
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:40,671
''Just stuff''?

781
01:02:40,842 --> 01:02:42,742
Yeah, just stuff.

782
01:02:46,114 --> 01:02:49,675
Why don't you come over here and rub
some of that stuff off on your mother?

783
01:03:06,668 --> 01:03:08,636
Oh, God.

784
01:03:09,203 --> 01:03:11,330
I still miss him.

785
01:03:12,206 --> 01:03:14,140
I know, Ma.

786
01:03:22,717 --> 01:03:27,154
-She still loves him, you know.
-Yeah, try to figure that one out.

787
01:03:29,857 --> 01:03:33,759
So did I tell you that Charlie moved
back home a couple weeks ago?

788
01:03:34,696 --> 01:03:36,857
Yeah, you told me.

789
01:03:41,035 --> 01:03:43,401
I think I'm gonna go out with him
tomorrow night.

790
01:03:43,571 --> 01:03:45,368
Claudia...

791
01:03:46,975 --> 01:03:50,934
...one asshole walks out of our lives,
you're gonna let another walk back in?

792
01:03:51,112 --> 01:03:53,546
I swear you're as bad as mom.

793
01:03:54,082 --> 01:03:56,607
I don't know
if I ever got over him, Kelly.

794
01:03:56,818 --> 01:03:58,718
What about Michael?

795
01:03:59,587 --> 01:04:02,988
You know? Are you thinking
about him through all of this?

796
01:04:04,492 --> 01:04:08,929
Look, I don't want you to think
I feel good about this...

797
01:04:09,797 --> 01:04:13,198
...but I'm just not happy
with Michael anymore.

798
01:04:14,469 --> 01:04:18,132
I want a different life
than the one I'm living so much.

799
01:04:18,639 --> 01:04:21,301
So you think Charlie's the answer.

800
01:04:23,644 --> 01:04:25,509
I don't know.

801
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:27,980
But he might be.

802
01:04:28,516 --> 01:04:30,074
No.

803
01:04:31,319 --> 01:04:33,514
I'm not gonna tell you
how to live your life...

804
01:04:33,721 --> 01:04:37,851
...but I will give you the one decent
piece of advice Pop ever gave me.

805
01:04:38,092 --> 01:04:41,528
He said, ''No matter how hard you try,
you can't shine shit.''

806
01:04:42,363 --> 01:04:44,763
And that kid is shit.

807
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:49,297
No, Kelly, you're wrong.
It's different now. He changed.

808
01:04:49,871 --> 01:04:53,170
And he's reminded me
I want more out of life.

809
01:04:53,508 --> 01:04:56,739
Oh, I find that so hard to believe,
Claudia.

810
01:04:56,944 --> 01:04:58,468
People don't change.

811
01:04:59,247 --> 01:05:01,181
Look at Pop.

812
01:05:01,349 --> 01:05:03,943
I think you're looking
for something here...

813
01:05:04,118 --> 01:05:06,211
...that wasn't right for you
three years ago.

814
01:05:06,954 --> 01:05:09,047
So why do you gotta do this?

815
01:05:10,324 --> 01:05:14,385
Because I don't wanna wake up
1 0 years from now and ask ''What if?''

816
01:05:17,465 --> 01:05:18,796
Fine.

817
01:05:34,348 --> 01:05:37,078
-Take it easy, Scully.
-You too, doll.

818
01:06:25,933 --> 01:06:27,264
See you on Monday.

819
01:06:27,435 --> 01:06:31,235
-Where are you headed all prettied up?
-Nowhere special.

820
01:06:31,439 --> 01:06:34,374
''Nowhere special,'' my ass.

821
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,265
There you go.

822
01:07:08,743 --> 01:07:11,439
-There you are, young lady.
-Thanks.

823
01:07:11,646 --> 01:07:15,173
All right, so you gotta explain to me
your deal with Florida, all right.

824
01:07:15,416 --> 01:07:19,352
I got a guy that I know from California
who's got a place down in Gainesville.

825
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:23,320
He said we could crash there for free
for a couple of weeks till we get set up.

826
01:07:23,491 --> 01:07:24,856
What do we need with Florida?

827
01:07:25,026 --> 01:07:27,324
It's a bunch of old people,
early-bird specials.

828
01:07:27,495 --> 01:07:29,929
You gotta be kidding me.
It's beautiful down there.

829
01:07:30,097 --> 01:07:33,464
-And they got good beaches, I mean--
-I don't need any more beaches.

830
01:07:33,668 --> 01:07:37,627
I wanna go someplace different,
like Seattle.

831
01:07:37,838 --> 01:07:39,772
Seattle? No shot.

832
01:07:39,941 --> 01:07:42,432
It's miserable there.
I mean, it's cold, it's rainy.

833
01:07:42,610 --> 01:07:45,101
If we're gonna do that,
we may as well stay here.

834
01:07:45,313 --> 01:07:47,804
No, if we're gonna do this,
I want someplace warm.

835
01:07:48,015 --> 01:07:50,506
I mean, let's go out West.
We'll go to Vegas.

836
01:07:50,685 --> 01:07:52,448
No.

837
01:07:53,054 --> 01:07:57,047
How about Texas?
You'd look good in a cowboy hat.

838
01:07:57,225 --> 01:07:58,988
-Oh, you think so, do you?
-Yeah.

839
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:02,561
Texas, huh? I like Texas. That works.

840
01:08:02,730 --> 01:08:04,664
It's a big place,
anywhere in particular?

841
01:08:04,832 --> 01:08:07,562
No. We'll figure it out
when we get there.

842
01:08:07,735 --> 01:08:10,863
All right, then. Texas it is.

843
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,832
You see?

844
01:08:14,075 --> 01:08:16,509
I told you we were meant
for one another, didn't l?

845
01:08:16,711 --> 01:08:18,303
Yeah.

846
01:08:21,349 --> 01:08:24,250
What's up? Something wrong?

847
01:08:25,019 --> 01:08:28,819
Do you ever think about what our lives
would be like if we'd had the baby?

848
01:08:28,990 --> 01:08:32,517
Yeah. Yeah, we'd be miserable.

849
01:08:33,227 --> 01:08:35,593
Because we're just
so happy now, huh?

850
01:08:35,830 --> 01:08:39,266
I'm happy. I'm real happy.

851
01:08:40,534 --> 01:08:44,368
Now, Claudia, think about it. If we
had kids, we'd be spending every day...

852
01:08:44,538 --> 01:08:47,996
...working hard to feed them,
clothe them, put them through school...

853
01:08:48,209 --> 01:08:51,906
...only for them to tell us to go
fuck ourselves when they turn 1 6.

854
01:08:52,113 --> 01:08:53,876
No, thanks.

855
01:08:54,749 --> 01:08:57,047
It's probably good you feel that way.

856
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:03,379
Because I'm wanna tell you something
that I haven't told anybody.

857
01:09:03,557 --> 01:09:07,425
I mean, not my mother, not Michael,
not even Kelly. Okay?

858
01:09:08,029 --> 01:09:11,192
Yeah, yeah. What's up?

859
01:09:14,435 --> 01:09:17,029
After I had the abortion...

860
01:09:17,905 --> 01:09:20,032
...there were some complications...

861
01:09:20,207 --> 01:09:24,371
...and I had to go back
in the hospital.

862
01:09:25,546 --> 01:09:29,209
And now they say there's a chance
I might not be able to have children.

863
01:09:31,619 --> 01:09:33,814
Look, l....

864
01:09:36,657 --> 01:09:39,421
Hey, I'm sorry, you know?

865
01:09:42,897 --> 01:09:44,831
It's weird, you know?

866
01:09:45,566 --> 01:09:50,469
I never really thought about wanting kids
until I heard maybe I couldn't.

867
01:09:57,545 --> 01:09:59,103
Hey.

868
01:10:00,815 --> 01:10:03,978
What do you say
you give me that dance now, huh?

869
01:10:11,592 --> 01:10:13,184
Come on.

870
01:13:02,129 --> 01:13:04,757
-Goldie, you seen Claudia tonight?
-Mikey, what's up?

871
01:13:04,932 --> 01:13:07,025
No, I ain't seen her.

872
01:13:07,501 --> 01:13:11,164
-Help yourself.
-Think she's at your house with Missy?

873
01:13:11,372 --> 01:13:14,432
No, I don't think so.

874
01:13:14,642 --> 01:13:16,439
Is everything all right?

875
01:13:18,012 --> 01:13:20,003
No, everything's not all right, all right?

876
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:23,809
It's 1 :00 in the morning and
I haven't heard from my old lady all day.

877
01:13:23,984 --> 01:13:26,316
Something's up man, I know it.

878
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:29,182
What are you talking about?
What's wrong with you?

879
01:13:29,356 --> 01:13:33,122
She's probably out
with her sister or Teresa.

880
01:13:34,795 --> 01:13:37,491
Maybe you just missed her at home.
Why don't you try her?

881
01:13:37,698 --> 01:13:41,293
You probably just missed her, go ahead.
Come on.

882
01:13:41,835 --> 01:13:45,828
Can I get another shot here?
This is bullshit.

883
01:13:58,419 --> 01:14:01,582
<i>Hi, we're not home.</i>
<i>Leave a message at the beep.</i>

884
01:14:01,822 --> 01:14:04,586
<i>Claudia, if you're there,</i>
<i>pick up, it's me.</i>

885
01:14:04,758 --> 01:14:07,192
Claudia, it's me. Pick up.

886
01:14:14,168 --> 01:14:16,159
She's not there.

887
01:14:22,710 --> 01:14:24,837
Do you know something?

888
01:14:25,012 --> 01:14:26,741
Michael, what would I know?

889
01:14:26,914 --> 01:14:28,905
What would you know?

890
01:14:29,083 --> 01:14:31,608
Is she out with Charlie?
Is that what's going on here?

891
01:14:31,819 --> 01:14:34,720
Mikey, I don't-- I don't know nothing.

892
01:14:34,922 --> 01:14:37,447
Do you know something or not?

893
01:14:39,727 --> 01:14:44,721
Mike, what do you want me
to say to you?

894
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:49,767
Then you're gonna fuck me
behind my back too, huh?

895
01:14:49,937 --> 01:14:52,030
Come on, Mikey.

896
01:14:52,206 --> 01:14:54,231
Here. Thanks for the drink.

897
01:14:54,408 --> 01:14:56,842
Have a nice fucking life.

898
01:15:14,962 --> 01:15:19,399
-Michael, what's going on?
-Hey, Ter, sorry. Is Claudia here?

899
01:15:19,633 --> 01:15:21,123
No.

900
01:15:21,368 --> 01:15:23,427
-No.
-You know where she is?

901
01:15:24,104 --> 01:15:28,734
No. I mean, maybe she's with Kelly.

902
01:15:28,942 --> 01:15:30,739
I called Kelly's, there's no answer.

903
01:15:30,911 --> 01:15:34,176
I tried the bar.
I can't find her anywhere, you know?

904
01:15:36,583 --> 01:15:38,278
Well...

905
01:15:39,253 --> 01:15:42,120
...if she's not there
and she's not here....

906
01:15:47,995 --> 01:15:49,895
Do you...?

907
01:15:52,099 --> 01:15:54,090
Do you wanna to come up?

908
01:15:57,705 --> 01:16:00,469
-I mean, we can just talk--
-No.

909
01:16:00,808 --> 01:16:05,211
Listen, babe, you see Claudia, just
tell her I'm waiting back home, all right?

910
01:16:05,412 --> 01:16:07,846
Great. Fine.

911
01:16:11,218 --> 01:16:13,049
Michael.

912
01:16:13,721 --> 01:16:15,518
I'm sorry.

913
01:16:17,357 --> 01:16:19,052
So am l.

914
01:19:04,524 --> 01:19:07,015
Why are you doing this to me?

915
01:19:11,965 --> 01:19:13,660
What?

916
01:19:13,901 --> 01:19:15,732
Wanna tell me
where you were all night?

917
01:19:18,305 --> 01:19:21,797
-I was at work and then I went out.
-You didn't think to maybe call me?

918
01:19:24,177 --> 01:19:25,974
I'm sorry.

919
01:19:26,914 --> 01:19:29,508
I just went out and lost track of time.

920
01:19:29,716 --> 01:19:32,014
Please don't give me
a hard time about it, okay?

921
01:19:32,219 --> 01:19:34,517
Give you a hard time, huh?

922
01:19:35,756 --> 01:19:38,190
You walk through the door
at 5:00 in the morning...

923
01:19:38,358 --> 01:19:41,259
...and I'm not supposed to
give you a hard time.

924
01:19:42,362 --> 01:19:46,196
I'm sitting alone, staring at these walls.
I don't know if you're alive or dead.

925
01:19:46,366 --> 01:19:49,062
And I'm not supposed
to give you a hard time.

926
01:19:50,904 --> 01:19:53,168
Do me a favor, Claudia.

927
01:19:54,508 --> 01:19:55,839
Sit down.

928
01:19:59,246 --> 01:20:00,941
Sit down.

929
01:20:08,522 --> 01:20:11,286
Now, why don't you tell me
where you were tonight?

930
01:20:15,762 --> 01:20:17,696
I was at work and then I went out.

931
01:20:17,864 --> 01:20:20,731
I called work.
They told me you left early.

932
01:20:21,802 --> 01:20:23,963
Why'd you leave work early?

933
01:20:25,205 --> 01:20:28,106
Because it was quiet and I had plans.

934
01:20:28,275 --> 01:20:30,607
I called your mother's house.

935
01:20:31,078 --> 01:20:34,309
I called there three times,
and there was no answer.

936
01:20:35,749 --> 01:20:38,616
-Why would you call my mother's house?
-I don't know.

937
01:20:38,785 --> 01:20:40,946
Maybe because
I was worried about you.

938
01:20:42,422 --> 01:20:44,322
I'm sorry.

939
01:20:48,695 --> 01:20:51,630
You don't give a fuck about me,
do you?

940
01:20:52,099 --> 01:20:53,964
Michael....

941
01:20:55,268 --> 01:20:57,998
I can't deal with this, Claudia.

942
01:20:59,272 --> 01:21:01,740
Why can't you just
be honest with me?

943
01:21:02,709 --> 01:21:06,270
Just answer me.
Do you give a damn about us anymore?

944
01:21:07,914 --> 01:21:09,814
What? I can't hear you.

945
01:21:09,983 --> 01:21:12,144
Where were you tonight?

946
01:21:17,491 --> 01:21:19,254
I don't know.

947
01:21:19,426 --> 01:21:21,291
You don't know.

948
01:21:23,030 --> 01:21:25,464
You don't know where you were...

949
01:21:25,632 --> 01:21:27,759
...or you don't know
who you were with?

950
01:21:27,934 --> 01:21:30,459
Or you don't know
if you give a damn about us anymore?

951
01:21:30,637 --> 01:21:33,128
I'm not gonna let you
make a jerkoff out of me.

952
01:21:33,306 --> 01:21:37,538
There's plenty of other women out there
who'd show me a little bit of respect.

953
01:21:42,883 --> 01:21:45,443
You were with Charlie, weren't you?

954
01:21:48,622 --> 01:21:50,317
Weren't you?

955
01:21:50,490 --> 01:21:52,287
Yeah.

956
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:02,224
Michael, let me explain.

957
01:22:02,836 --> 01:22:05,066
The last thing I wanted to do
was hurt you.

958
01:22:05,272 --> 01:22:08,708
-I don't deserve this.
-I'm so sorry.

959
01:22:09,376 --> 01:22:11,571
You know what I want you to do?

960
01:22:12,345 --> 01:22:14,575
I want you to leave my house.

961
01:22:15,282 --> 01:22:18,217
I want you to pack a bag
and I want you to leave.

962
01:22:18,385 --> 01:22:20,649
I don't ever wanna fucking
see your face again.

963
01:22:20,854 --> 01:22:23,721
-Michael, come on.
-Get out.

964
01:22:24,224 --> 01:22:26,692
Just get the fuck out of here.

965
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:29,414
Everything all right?

966
01:24:29,616 --> 01:24:33,313
-Yeah, everything's fine, Mom.
-Any news from your father?

967
01:24:33,620 --> 01:24:35,144
No.

968
01:24:35,956 --> 01:24:37,514
Good.

969
01:24:37,857 --> 01:24:40,553
The next time he calls,
he's gonna want the house back...

970
01:24:40,727 --> 01:24:43,719
...and we're gonna be
out on the street.

971
01:24:48,168 --> 01:24:51,626
Oh, God, will you smell that sea air?

972
01:24:53,373 --> 01:24:56,467
Jesus, Mary and Joseph,
I've been holed up long in this house...

973
01:24:56,643 --> 01:24:59,510
...that I forgot
what the ocean smelled like.

974
01:25:02,249 --> 01:25:04,513
You're feeling better, huh?

975
01:25:05,018 --> 01:25:06,815
Yep.

976
01:25:07,487 --> 01:25:09,455
I guess I am.

977
01:25:11,191 --> 01:25:13,386
What's going on with you?

978
01:25:16,863 --> 01:25:18,854
I'm....

979
01:25:20,066 --> 01:25:23,729
I guess it's not gonna work out
with me and Michael after all.

980
01:25:25,272 --> 01:25:28,264
Yeah, I sort of suspected that.

981
01:25:30,610 --> 01:25:33,374
You know,
ever since you were a little girl...

982
01:25:33,546 --> 01:25:37,846
...you were always much more
like your father than you were like me.

983
01:25:38,418 --> 01:25:41,046
Don't take that the wrong way.

984
01:25:41,221 --> 01:25:44,452
I fell in love with him
because he was so different than...

985
01:25:44,624 --> 01:25:47,559
...God, everybody around here.

986
01:25:50,897 --> 01:25:54,628
I guess I knew what I was getting into
when I married him.

987
01:25:57,804 --> 01:26:01,262
But you always think
you're gonna change somebody.

988
01:26:03,510 --> 01:26:05,603
You can't do it.

989
01:26:10,617 --> 01:26:13,142
So it's okay, you know.

990
01:26:15,422 --> 01:26:18,391
It's okay to take care of yourself.

991
01:26:22,462 --> 01:26:24,259
Yep.

992
01:27:35,602 --> 01:27:37,593
Hey, darling.

993
01:27:52,118 --> 01:27:53,642
Well, look who it is.

994
01:27:54,421 --> 01:27:55,752
Hi.

995
01:27:56,990 --> 01:27:58,480
How you been?

996
01:28:01,327 --> 01:28:05,229
So look, I've been doing
some thinking about the trip...

997
01:28:05,432 --> 01:28:10,335
...and I think if we're gonna do this,
I figure we may as well leave next week.

998
01:28:10,503 --> 01:28:12,198
What do you think?

999
01:28:13,173 --> 01:28:15,334
I've been....

1000
01:28:17,644 --> 01:28:22,206
-I just don't think it's gonna work.
-You don't think it's gonna work.

1001
01:28:22,649 --> 01:28:24,378
That's great.

1002
01:28:26,019 --> 01:28:28,920
So, what are you gonna do?
You gonna marry Michael after all?

1003
01:28:31,024 --> 01:28:34,084
Nope. It's got nothing to do with him.

1004
01:28:34,294 --> 01:28:36,262
Well, then, what is it?

1005
01:28:37,263 --> 01:28:40,926
I mean, did I--?
Did I do something wrong?

1006
01:28:41,734 --> 01:28:45,670
No. No, you didn't do
anything wrong. I just--

1007
01:28:46,306 --> 01:28:49,036
I gotta figure some things out.

1008
01:28:49,409 --> 01:28:52,537
And I think it's best
if I just figure them out on my own.

1009
01:28:52,745 --> 01:28:56,408
If anyone's gonna understand that,
it's gonna be you, right?

1010
01:28:57,417 --> 01:28:59,942
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

1011
01:29:01,721 --> 01:29:05,384
So, what, I guess this is
your idea of payback, huh?

1012
01:29:05,558 --> 01:29:08,322
Nope, it's nothing like that.

1013
01:29:08,895 --> 01:29:11,056
I'm just taking care of myself.

1014
01:29:12,632 --> 01:29:14,463
All right.

1015
01:29:15,101 --> 01:29:17,661
So I guess I'll see you around, right?

1016
01:29:20,006 --> 01:29:21,564
Yep.

1017
01:29:22,342 --> 01:29:24,242
See you around.

1018
01:29:28,715 --> 01:29:31,081
Hey, Claudia.

1019
01:29:32,018 --> 01:29:34,612
I hope you find
what you're looking for.
