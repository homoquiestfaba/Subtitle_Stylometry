1
00:00:46,807 --> 00:00:48,295
Emergency?

2
00:00:54,739 --> 00:00:55,730
Hello?

3
00:00:57,982 --> 00:00:59,190
What's the problem?

4
00:01:00,307 --> 00:01:01,438
Hello?

5
00:01:01,515 --> 00:01:02,833
Help.

6
00:01:07,642 --> 00:01:08,801
They're sick.

7
00:01:13,697 --> 00:01:15,591
They're all sick.

8
00:01:29,718 --> 00:01:31,971
There's blood..

9
00:01:33,366 --> 00:01:35,964
There's blood..

10
00:01:36,084 --> 00:01:37,346
Everywhere.

11
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:54,131
They're looking for us.

12
00:01:55,318 --> 00:01:56,117
Please.

13
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:06,054
Find us.

14
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,028
The incidents in the States
were isolated.

15
00:03:03,077 --> 00:03:04,556
Successfuly contained.

16
00:03:04,596 --> 00:03:06,098
We don't know how
it reached there.

17
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,733
Your inability to manage and contain
this situation is mind boggling.

18
00:03:09,765 --> 00:03:14,461
Let me be frank, under your guidance
we're now standing face to face with a catasrophic shitstorm..

19
00:03:14,509 --> 00:03:17,808
And i am standing face to face
with incompetence.

20
00:03:18,008 --> 00:03:19,039
Translate.

21
00:03:19,478 --> 00:03:20,781
May i have your attention please?

22
00:03:21,573 --> 00:03:23,492
From here on,
the team is small.

23
00:03:24,212 --> 00:03:26,748
No parents,
no family.

24
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,746
Anyone meeting that criteria,
please go the the exits now.

25
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,527
If something's go sideways,
i've never been good in sending flowers.

26
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:41,250
Pull it up.

27
00:03:42,886 --> 00:03:45,843
Ground Zero was a non-profit housing
for Humanity's Project.

28
00:03:45,963 --> 00:03:48,297
American tourists building shacks
for the poor.

29
00:03:48,576 --> 00:03:50,550
Fatalities were discovered on site.

30
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,230
One anomaly.

31
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,457
The sample arrived this morning.

32
00:03:57,497 --> 00:03:58,448
Bridget..

33
00:03:58,657 --> 00:04:01,646
He's not a sample. He's a patient.
-Yes.

34
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:04,029
He's Patient Zero.

35
00:04:13,702 --> 00:04:14,590
Mr Porter?

36
00:04:16,404 --> 00:04:17,435
Mr Porter?

37
00:04:17,555 --> 00:04:19,394
My name is Dr. Edwards.

38
00:04:47,502 --> 00:04:48,961
We are..

39
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:50,869
On the verge..

40
00:04:50,989 --> 00:04:52,761
Of a global pandemic.

41
00:04:52,881 --> 00:04:54,469
And you are..

42
00:04:54,589 --> 00:04:58,971
The only known carrier of this virus
who's asymtopmatic.

43
00:04:59,401 --> 00:05:00,849
The good news..

44
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:03,666
Is that it's not an airborne virus.

45
00:05:03,686 --> 00:05:05,384
And the bad news is..

46
00:05:05,504 --> 00:05:07,482
We have no way
of containing it.

47
00:05:08,957 --> 00:05:10,625
Where is my son?

48
00:05:11,624 --> 00:05:13,697
We're supposed to go somewhere.

49
00:05:13,817 --> 00:05:15,195
His prep school.

50
00:05:15,535 --> 00:05:18,667
We have to buy books
and pencils.

51
00:05:20,485 --> 00:05:22,673
Your son is dead, Mr Porter.

52
00:05:22,963 --> 00:05:24,366
I think you know that.

53
00:05:33,293 --> 00:05:35,020
You have..

54
00:05:35,559 --> 00:05:37,747
An incredible
opportunity.

55
00:05:37,867 --> 00:05:40,005
To do something special.

56
00:05:42,026 --> 00:05:43,615
I can't help you.

57
00:05:46,337 --> 00:05:47,986
I wasn't asking.

58
00:05:49,005 --> 00:05:51,104
I don't know who the fuck
you think you are..

59
00:06:29,163 --> 00:06:30,751
There he is.
There he is.

60
00:06:31,171 --> 00:06:32,300
Yeah.

61
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,759
Hey, friend!
-Hey!

62
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:39,642
What's up, bro?

63
00:06:40,811 --> 00:06:43,023
What the hell
are you wearing?

64
00:06:43,233 --> 00:06:46,290
What do you mean?
Kate wants me to look sophisticated.

65
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,425
What's so funny?

66
00:06:48,855 --> 00:06:50,513
Why were you so late?

67
00:06:50,633 --> 00:06:52,769
Oh the transportation,
they ran a little late.

68
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:55,097
I got like an extra $600 on them, though.

69
00:06:55,117 --> 00:06:57,634
Really?
-What do you think? It's about time we..

70
00:06:57,894 --> 00:07:03,217
Do the whole 30 footer boat,
maybe expand the dive shot?

71
00:07:03,337 --> 00:07:07,210
Let's talk business after the wedding, let me just get through this first, alright?
-Alright.

72
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,741
We're late, we're so late.
Kate's whole family is waiting for us.

73
00:07:11,221 --> 00:07:13,269
Come on, we gotta get going.

74
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:14,819
I'm glad you can make it.

75
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:18,375
What do you mean, glad i can make it?
Marky, look at me.

76
00:07:18,735 --> 00:07:21,504
I wouldn't miss this
for the world, brother. Alright?

77
00:07:34,942 --> 00:07:37,169
Bro, this one's taken.

78
00:07:40,346 --> 00:07:41,994
So rude.

79
00:07:43,513 --> 00:07:46,674
To Marcus' brother,
wherever he's hiding.

80
00:07:46,794 --> 00:07:48,552
A warm thank you.

81
00:07:48,812 --> 00:07:52,605
And i'd like to offer a special toast
to those who couldn't be here tonight.

82
00:07:52,635 --> 00:07:54,613
Marcus' parents.

83
00:07:55,053 --> 00:07:56,452
They'll be dearly missed.

84
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,447
You're the guy, buddy.
You're the guy.

85
00:08:10,396 --> 00:08:13,834
Marcus, you promised.
-Promise what?

86
00:08:15,312 --> 00:08:18,829
Oh no.. What is he wearing?

87
00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:21,040
Wait one second.

88
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,678
I'll take care of this.
I'll be right back.

89
00:08:26,026 --> 00:08:28,811
Alright, who ate all the food?

90
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,668
This guy.

91
00:08:31,788 --> 00:08:33,787
Hey Josh..
-Hey.

92
00:08:35,296 --> 00:08:37,335
Come on, i think you've had enough.

93
00:08:38,005 --> 00:08:40,134
Hola.
-Hey.

94
00:08:40,684 --> 00:08:42,523
Hey Marky, long time.

95
00:08:42,643 --> 00:08:44,012
Penny..

96
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:47,691
What?

97
00:08:51,456 --> 00:08:55,672
Guys, guys come on.
There's water right there.

98
00:08:56,362 --> 00:08:59,619
What happened to the shirt i left out for you?
And the pants?

99
00:09:00,518 --> 00:09:02,930
Dude, this looks really cool.

100
00:09:04,898 --> 00:09:06,766
Is it good?
Good food?

101
00:09:06,886 --> 00:09:08,211
Aloha.

102
00:09:08,331 --> 00:09:11,697
Go, go,
go get your lady, man.

103
00:09:12,906 --> 00:09:14,575
This is pretty.

104
00:09:27,229 --> 00:09:30,783
We're gonna..
Why don't we get some fresh oranges?

105
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:42,855
Very lucky man..
How do i say lucky man?

106
00:09:47,684 --> 00:09:49,043
Helo, friend.

107
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,117
What's up?

108
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:06,338
No, thank you.

109
00:10:17,836 --> 00:10:20,683
She's not trying to sell it to you,
she's trying to give it to you.

110
00:10:22,202 --> 00:10:25,447
It's a Puka.

111
00:10:25,737 --> 00:10:28,184
It's for protection,
against evil.

112
00:10:28,843 --> 00:10:30,561
From..
Santeria.

113
00:10:30,661 --> 00:10:32,589
Like a..

114
00:10:32,689 --> 00:10:34,627
Central America voodoo thing.

115
00:10:34,647 --> 00:10:37,624
Beheaded chickens,
sacrifices..

116
00:10:38,293 --> 00:10:40,239
Gotta love the third world.

117
00:10:51,106 --> 00:10:52,165
Marky..

118
00:10:52,395 --> 00:10:54,143
Yo, check that one.

119
00:10:55,558 --> 00:10:57,227
Yeah, not too shabby.

120
00:10:57,347 --> 00:10:59,025
Why don't you take it
for a test drive?

121
00:10:59,055 --> 00:11:01,549
Yeah right.
-Hello, friends.

122
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,307
Marky Marcus..

123
00:11:03,846 --> 00:11:05,345
Your brother and i..

124
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:09,037
Your two best..
Your two lifers..

125
00:11:09,157 --> 00:11:14,110
Your two fuck ups, who couldn't afford
a real bachelor party back home..

126
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,438
Have conspired to pull this off.

127
00:11:17,314 --> 00:11:19,402
Bro, we've been planning this
for months.

128
00:11:19,522 --> 00:11:22,209
One last night of freedom
with the old crew.

129
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:25,340
And a charterred trip to a deserted
tropical island.

130
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,467
Full of beers, suns,
and virgin bitches..

131
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:30,205
Beaches..
-Beaches.

132
00:11:30,325 --> 00:11:31,674
Sand, water..

133
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:38,371
For real?
-Have a good time, babe.

134
00:11:41,122 --> 00:11:45,450
Wait a sec, so all that crap
about no bachelor party?

135
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,208
Was prep..

136
00:11:48,447 --> 00:11:51,695
Hey man, hotel already loaded our bags.
-No..

137
00:11:51,815 --> 00:11:53,603
No..

138
00:11:54,454 --> 00:11:57,660
Don't forget to wear sunscreen,
i don't want you sunburned in all the photos tomorrow.

139
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,515
I won't.
-And do not go too far north.

140
00:12:00,635 --> 00:12:02,433
It's restricted waters.

141
00:12:02,692 --> 00:12:05,100
Hey, if you're so worried,
why don't you come?

142
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,532
It wouldn't be a bachelor party
if i'm there.

143
00:12:08,381 --> 00:12:10,080
Why is Penny going?

144
00:12:12,742 --> 00:12:15,839
She's practically one of the guys,
you guys grew up together.

145
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:19,254
Besides, my family is having
this thing for me tonight and..

146
00:12:19,374 --> 00:12:21,478
It'll be terribly stiff
and proper.

147
00:12:21,748 --> 00:12:24,196
She'd be miserable.
-Would she?

148
00:12:25,015 --> 00:12:27,335
It's easier on all of us.

149
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,642
Go have a good time,
you deserve it.

150
00:12:29,762 --> 00:12:31,391
You're a horrible liar.

151
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,431
You're beautiful.

152
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:43,618
I'll miss you.

153
00:12:47,314 --> 00:12:49,522
Bye.
-Okay..

154
00:12:49,642 --> 00:12:51,171
There he is.
-Okay.

155
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:52,889
Yeah!
-Okay.

156
00:12:54,372 --> 00:12:57,798
Let's keep it adjusted.
Tune time, tune time.

157
00:13:15,803 --> 00:13:18,300
Three blind mice..

158
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,022
Three blind mice..

159
00:13:21,142 --> 00:13:23,789
See how they run..

160
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,240
My mother used to sing
that to me.

161
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:44,028
I love children's songs.

162
00:13:44,967 --> 00:13:46,995
Your children song
is a protest..

163
00:13:47,115 --> 00:13:51,137
Against the wrongful imprisonment,
torture and execution of three Protestans..

164
00:13:51,157 --> 00:13:53,191
By Queen Mary
in the 1500s.

165
00:13:53,311 --> 00:13:55,169
Porter, please.

166
00:13:56,148 --> 00:13:58,907
You can't go days without
talking to anyone.

167
00:13:59,027 --> 00:14:00,995
Please, talk to me.

168
00:14:01,464 --> 00:14:03,013
Oh, you want to talk?

169
00:14:03,512 --> 00:14:04,695
Okay.

170
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:06,803
How's my wife?

171
00:14:08,861 --> 00:14:10,401
Does she know
i'm here?

172
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:12,639
She knows about
her son?

173
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,927
Does she know
that he melted in my arms?

174
00:14:18,306 --> 00:14:19,754
Does she?

175
00:14:19,874 --> 00:14:20,631
Porter, stop.

176
00:14:20,751 --> 00:14:23,808
They all ran after the farmer's wife,
and cut off their tails with a carving knife..

177
00:14:23,928 --> 00:14:26,786
Porter, stop!
Don't put yourself through this.

178
00:14:27,406 --> 00:14:28,934
Please.

179
00:14:29,151 --> 00:14:31,809
I'm a US citizen,
i have rights.

180
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:34,888
I want to talk to the
American Embassy.

181
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:38,475
It's the US CDC law that requires
that you'd be quarantined.

182
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:40,641
You're a pandemic carrier.

183
00:14:40,761 --> 00:14:42,239
We're not in
United States.

184
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:44,047
This is extraordinary rendition..

185
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:46,593
You can't just keep
experimenting on me!

186
00:14:46,713 --> 00:14:49,590
Porter, you're not just
a carrier.

187
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,588
You're a possible cure.

188
00:14:52,987 --> 00:14:55,325
You have a natural imunity
to the virus.

189
00:14:55,445 --> 00:14:57,781
Try to focus on the good
that you're providing.

190
00:14:57,811 --> 00:14:59,699
I've complied to everything
you've wanted.

191
00:14:59,819 --> 00:15:01,935
You've poked and prodded on me
for two months.

192
00:15:02,055 --> 00:15:03,983
If i don't talk to my wife
in the next 15 minutes..

193
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:07,065
I swear to God, i'm gonna kill myself.
Do you hear me?

194
00:15:07,185 --> 00:15:09,291
I'm gonna fucking
kill myself!

195
00:15:09,315 --> 00:15:11,090
I've spoken with Christina.

196
00:15:14,904 --> 00:15:15,896
Porter.

197
00:15:16,141 --> 00:15:18,133
She knows about your son.

198
00:15:22,295 --> 00:15:25,426
She also knows that you are here with us
in quarantine.

199
00:15:25,907 --> 00:15:28,017
Obviously she's worried about you.

200
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:32,280
She wanted me to tell you
that she loves you very much.

201
00:15:34,652 --> 00:15:36,213
And she'll be waiting for you.

202
00:15:53,803 --> 00:15:55,499
I want you to know something.

203
00:15:57,432 --> 00:15:59,636
I'm not just dangerous to myself.

204
00:16:17,931 --> 00:16:19,821
They are remarkable specimens.

205
00:16:19,941 --> 00:16:21,087
Human.

206
00:16:21,207 --> 00:16:24,463
You mean human, don't you doctor?
He's a human being.

207
00:16:26,835 --> 00:16:28,616
Get up, come on.

208
00:16:35,683 --> 00:16:38,577
What we have in that cage
isn't just a man.

209
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,495
It is the engine of a new
life form..

210
00:16:40,549 --> 00:16:43,175
And make no mistake,
it wants to destroy us.

211
00:16:43,991 --> 00:16:46,573
Don't personalize this,
Camila.

212
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:50,196
Sometimes we have to
harm one..

213
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,340
In order to save millions.

214
00:17:25,255 --> 00:17:27,622
The sample's in the ready position, doctor.

215
00:17:27,742 --> 00:17:30,205
Good morning, Mr Porter.
It's time for your 8.30.

216
00:17:30,593 --> 00:17:32,539
Jorge, prepare for another extraction.

217
00:17:32,573 --> 00:17:34,885
Mark it 0713.

218
00:17:35,005 --> 00:17:39,652
Bridget, i'll need a full work up
on the genome and the basic protein.

219
00:18:19,881 --> 00:18:21,511
Don't you get up, Mr Porter.

220
00:18:21,545 --> 00:18:22,659
Don't you move.

221
00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:25,165
It's my blood you want, right?
You want it?

222
00:18:25,285 --> 00:18:26,293
Take it!

223
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:32,565
You want to shoot me?
Come on, shoot!

224
00:18:41,368 --> 00:18:42,372
Wait!

225
00:18:42,492 --> 00:18:43,857
This is a mistake.

226
00:18:43,977 --> 00:18:46,153
The situation has been contained.
-Hello?

227
00:18:46,273 --> 00:18:47,678
The sample is still secure.

228
00:18:47,798 --> 00:18:49,670
I'm sorry, Doctor.
As you know..

229
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:54,164
The protocol requires a mandatory facility lockdown of 48 hours.

230
00:18:54,805 --> 00:18:59,221
All of the staff will be temporarily transferred
to the evacuation bunker.

231
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,837
Where we wait for
re-entry clearance.

232
00:19:02,462 --> 00:19:04,694
I'm sure you understand.

233
00:19:07,352 --> 00:19:09,806
We will see you in two days.

234
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,262
Friend.

235
00:19:48,009 --> 00:19:50,929
You always had the biggest crush on her
back in second grade.

236
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:52,581
You never want to admit it.

237
00:19:52,631 --> 00:19:54,843
So when's the last time
you saw Penny anyway?

238
00:19:57,435 --> 00:20:00,228
Alright, on your feet soldiers!

239
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,068
Come on!

240
00:20:04,358 --> 00:20:06,620
Alright boys, man up.

241
00:20:06,662 --> 00:20:08,463
Open up your hatches on 3.

242
00:20:08,506 --> 00:20:10,548
1.. 2.. 3.

243
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,899
Come on, you're the one who taught me
how to do this.

244
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,640
Yeah, when i was 19.

245
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,209
Now i drink for flavor.

246
00:20:27,766 --> 00:20:29,873
Oh yeah, that's for babies.

247
00:20:29,923 --> 00:20:32,202
He's all fancy now that
he's marrying into money.

248
00:20:32,252 --> 00:20:34,556
Hey, hey..
Jokes aside..

249
00:20:35,206 --> 00:20:36,962
Marky Marcus.

250
00:20:37,082 --> 00:20:39,131
As your little bro
and best friend.

251
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,278
Tomorrow night when you wed
the lovely Kate..

252
00:20:42,398 --> 00:20:45,620
The single world will mourn the loss
of one of the greats.

253
00:20:46,164 --> 00:20:47,565
And in honor of that..

254
00:20:47,685 --> 00:20:51,515
I got you something meaningful
to help prepare you for a new life.

255
00:20:51,536 --> 00:20:53,604
What is this, Joshie?
What did you get me?

256
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:55,739
What is this?

257
00:20:56,237 --> 00:20:58,898
Oh, is this about that thing?

258
00:20:58,931 --> 00:21:02,037
Open it.
-What could this be?

259
00:21:08,264 --> 00:21:09,834
Boom!
-Boom!

260
00:21:11,024 --> 00:21:14,205
Thanks guys, i can take care
of my girl.

261
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:19,039
It's not for her, that's for you.
Getting you all loosen up for all the bend over you'll be doing.

262
00:21:19,081 --> 00:21:21,757
I told these boners
they were crossing the line.

263
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:23,166
Alright, it's my turn.

264
00:21:24,173 --> 00:21:25,987
But mine needs an explanation.

265
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:31,454
Do you remember when we were kids
and you went to go inside the Street Lamp Charade?

266
00:21:31,574 --> 00:21:32,822
Yeah.

267
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:35,233
What is it?
-Open it.

268
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,680
So you always know
where you came from.

269
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,309
Oh wow..
-Watch.

270
00:21:40,264 --> 00:21:42,830
That's awesome, thank you so much, Pen.

271
00:21:43,378 --> 00:21:44,670
It's so cool.

272
00:21:49,671 --> 00:21:50,566
Alright.

273
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:52,743
This is your own present.

274
00:21:57,493 --> 00:21:59,417
No, fuck no.
-Woo Woo..

275
00:21:59,501 --> 00:22:01,417
Hey hey.. We spent a fortune on that.

276
00:22:01,451 --> 00:22:04,379
You guys know how much trouble we're gonna get
if the Coast Guard finds this on here?

277
00:22:04,738 --> 00:22:07,785
Not to mention Kate's family,
how embarassed they'll be guys.

278
00:22:07,905 --> 00:22:09,525
God forbid that happens.

279
00:22:09,645 --> 00:22:11,391
Mark, Mark..

280
00:22:12,783 --> 00:22:15,007
We've been going north
for a while now.

281
00:22:15,127 --> 00:22:17,826
We haven't seen a boat in 2 hours.

282
00:22:19,007 --> 00:22:20,154
Hey, hey..

283
00:22:20,914 --> 00:22:25,098
Think we're far enough away from civilization
where you can relax a little bit, maybe..

284
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,373
Let loose?

285
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:29,992
Yeah, yeah.
-There we go. It's that kid..

286
00:22:30,034 --> 00:22:32,659
There he is, come here.

287
00:22:33,115 --> 00:22:35,694
Firing up from Kate's
scornful lies.

288
00:22:36,191 --> 00:22:38,917
Stop with the comments about Kate, please.

289
00:22:38,951 --> 00:22:40,202
It's just a joke, bro.

290
00:22:40,236 --> 00:22:42,582
No, you don't like her.
I get it.

291
00:22:43,485 --> 00:22:46,084
Now shut up, because after tomorrow night..

292
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,886
That's my wife
you're talking about.

293
00:22:49,671 --> 00:22:52,867
Marky Mark, come on dude.
Hey!

294
00:22:54,176 --> 00:22:55,062
What?

295
00:22:55,182 --> 00:22:57,291
When you get married,
you can't take a joke anymore?

296
00:23:02,724 --> 00:23:04,218
You see what's going on, right?

297
00:23:05,096 --> 00:23:07,046
They're scared that you're marrying up.

298
00:23:07,868 --> 00:23:09,657
And you'll gonna leave them behind.

299
00:23:11,109 --> 00:23:13,330
I'm not gonna leave
them behind.

300
00:23:14,605 --> 00:23:16,664
What's wrong with wanting more
than what you grew up with?

301
00:23:16,698 --> 00:23:17,812
Nothing.

302
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:20,555
If that's what you really want.

303
00:23:25,001 --> 00:23:26,470
Is it?
-Penny..

304
00:23:28,816 --> 00:23:29,879
What do you want?

305
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,178
Penny, come on.
That's not the..

306
00:23:32,298 --> 00:23:34,541
That's not the point,
Kate gets me.

307
00:23:36,027 --> 00:23:38,297
She's not like the people
we grew up with.

308
00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:43,922
And what's wrong with us?

309
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:48,538
Nothing.

310
00:23:49,601 --> 00:23:51,433
Kate just sees more for me.

311
00:23:52,652 --> 00:23:55,404
There was a time when you told me
something similar.

312
00:23:56,653 --> 00:23:58,249
Penny, we were kids.

313
00:23:59,532 --> 00:24:00,536
Funny.

314
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:03,302
I remember doing some
pretty adult things.

315
00:24:03,682 --> 00:24:06,839
Hey, hey, come on.
You're with Josh now.

316
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:08,425
Josh is fun.

317
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,690
But not serious.

318
00:24:11,156 --> 00:24:13,707
Kate's serious,
but not fun.

319
00:24:14,845 --> 00:24:16,895
Maybe we both made
the wrong choice.

320
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:19,041
It was one summer.

321
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:23,879
Don't make it more
than it was.

322
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,506
Sorry, gotta get..
Gotta go.

323
00:24:33,721 --> 00:24:35,977
Hey, she blows..

324
00:24:36,097 --> 00:24:37,594
Check it out.

325
00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:43,403
That's the deserted paradise, huh?

326
00:24:44,271 --> 00:24:46,104
It's Never Neverland, Marky.

327
00:24:46,574 --> 00:24:47,824
It's not even on the map.

328
00:24:49,301 --> 00:24:50,337
So..

329
00:24:51,146 --> 00:24:51,935
Is that..

330
00:24:52,994 --> 00:24:55,808
Is that a building on the northern side
of the ridge over there?

331
00:24:56,301 --> 00:24:57,400
What bui..
What?

332
00:24:59,448 --> 00:25:03,435
Hey, it's supposed to be virgin beach,
understand?

333
00:25:03,686 --> 00:25:06,303
No.. No people.

334
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:08,065
No building.

335
00:25:14,569 --> 00:25:15,730
What does that mean?

336
00:25:17,636 --> 00:25:19,322
Nobody home.

337
00:25:20,409 --> 00:25:22,966
Nobody home.
Nobody home.

338
00:25:23,025 --> 00:25:25,169
Alright. Nobody home.
-Nobody home.

339
00:25:27,313 --> 00:25:29,401
Hey, so we'll see you tomorrow.

340
00:25:29,874 --> 00:25:31,124
Tomorrow.

341
00:25:33,264 --> 00:25:34,240
But..

342
00:25:36,843 --> 00:25:38,477
Whatever.

343
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:41,189
It is beautiful up here.

344
00:25:44,837 --> 00:25:46,833
Wish us luck.

345
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:54,087
Breaker breaker,
this is Eagle Eye 1.

346
00:25:54,139 --> 00:25:56,742
Please advise Mr. Ares
that his son in law..

347
00:25:56,787 --> 00:26:00,506
Is about to get high as a motherfucker.
-Hey, come on.
-Relax.

348
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:02,421
This thing only go for like a mile.

349
00:26:11,808 --> 00:26:13,671
You guys want to head out
by the reef?

350
00:26:14,018 --> 00:26:16,984
And catch hundreds of fish?
It'll be unreal.

351
00:26:17,104 --> 00:26:19,180
I hear it's not to be missed.

352
00:26:19,852 --> 00:26:21,662
So why aren't you guys going?

353
00:26:22,031 --> 00:26:23,355
I'm just gonna chill, bro.

354
00:26:23,475 --> 00:26:24,486
We dive everyday.

355
00:26:24,538 --> 00:26:28,190
But when you guys get back,
we'll have lobsters on the grill, Brewskys on ice..

356
00:26:28,641 --> 00:26:30,016
Get this party started.

357
00:26:30,136 --> 00:26:31,982
We're supposed to be
treating you.

358
00:26:32,034 --> 00:26:33,587
It's fine,
we do this everyday.

359
00:26:35,908 --> 00:26:37,063
Hey, enjoy yourself.

360
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,405
Is that it? Anything else?
-I think so.

361
00:26:50,416 --> 00:26:52,043
Wait, here we go.

362
00:26:53,305 --> 00:26:54,407
Oh shit.

363
00:26:58,022 --> 00:26:58,841
Cheers.

364
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,320
Hey, thanks.

365
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,924
To you and
your wedding.

366
00:27:02,044 --> 00:27:05,182
May it last at least
7 months.

367
00:27:06,727 --> 00:27:08,967
Come on, let's go.
Enjoy paradise, let's do it.

368
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:34,154
So Kate's dad offered me a job
at his firm.

369
00:27:42,845 --> 00:27:43,976
Come on, man.

370
00:27:44,345 --> 00:27:46,527
Marky, you cannot bail
on me right now.

371
00:27:47,405 --> 00:27:49,535
We're finally turning a profit,
you're gonna..

372
00:27:51,221 --> 00:27:52,455
I haven't accept it.

373
00:27:56,465 --> 00:27:57,382
Right.

374
00:27:58,166 --> 00:27:58,980
Yet.

375
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,579
You don't have a choice?

376
00:28:07,993 --> 00:28:10,090
Can we just talk about this
after the wedding please?

377
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:11,295
I've just got..

378
00:28:11,332 --> 00:28:14,083
A hundred things going
through my head right now, and..

379
00:28:14,872 --> 00:28:17,393
The one thing that keeps
popping back up is..

380
00:28:23,532 --> 00:28:25,568
We are not coming home
with all this weed.

381
00:28:30,233 --> 00:28:32,660
That's one problem
i can help you with.

382
00:28:52,883 --> 00:28:54,199
Where are all the fish?

383
00:28:54,687 --> 00:28:55,826
Let's go there.

384
00:30:22,933 --> 00:30:24,286
What the fuck was that?

385
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:26,301
Calm down, just breathe.

386
00:30:26,421 --> 00:30:27,653
No, get me out of here.

387
00:30:27,694 --> 00:30:29,046
What happened?

388
00:30:29,257 --> 00:30:31,123
It's a fucking graveyard
out there.

389
00:30:31,173 --> 00:30:32,997
Penny thinks she saw something.

390
00:30:33,047 --> 00:30:35,114
I saw bodyparts.

391
00:30:37,767 --> 00:30:39,135
Baby, relax.

392
00:30:39,255 --> 00:30:41,735
Probably just some fish bits
left over from a shark attack.

393
00:30:42,116 --> 00:30:43,750
Wait, what did you see?

394
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,589
Shark attack?

395
00:30:52,382 --> 00:30:54,121
Oh God.

396
00:30:58,532 --> 00:31:00,701
You guys are as stone
as you look?

397
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:05,655
Give me some.

398
00:31:50,851 --> 00:31:52,152
This shouldn't be happening.

399
00:31:52,272 --> 00:31:54,910
The virus is attacking
faster than before.

400
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,711
What is that?
A vaccine?

401
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:58,379
Stop thinking small..

402
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:01,691
Why simply prevent a virus
from activating..

403
00:32:01,811 --> 00:32:04,323
If we can hunt it down
and kill it.

404
00:32:07,232 --> 00:32:08,445
Listen.

405
00:32:09,196 --> 00:32:11,207
I need you to go
talk to Porter.

406
00:32:11,239 --> 00:32:13,020
Keep him engaged,
can you do that?

407
00:32:13,063 --> 00:32:14,598
Yes.
-Thank you.

408
00:32:17,485 --> 00:32:19,720
Bridget, you're with me.
-Of course.

409
00:32:50,715 --> 00:32:52,117
What are you doing?

410
00:32:53,781 --> 00:32:55,962
You should have left
when i told you to.

411
00:32:57,898 --> 00:32:59,782
Doctor, we only have
one suit left.

412
00:32:59,902 --> 00:33:01,674
All the others were taken
to the bunker.

413
00:33:01,794 --> 00:33:04,245
Whoever administer the shot
gets the suit.

414
00:33:11,308 --> 00:33:12,449
You trust me?

415
00:33:14,778 --> 00:33:16,117
With my life.

416
00:33:16,353 --> 00:33:17,348
Good.

417
00:33:30,498 --> 00:33:32,839
You know what, it's your compassion..

418
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:34,984
That makes you different
from the rest of them.

419
00:33:42,805 --> 00:33:44,434
Is that what this is about?

420
00:33:44,554 --> 00:33:46,301
Are you distracting me?
-No, no!

421
00:33:46,342 --> 00:33:48,232
No, they're just testing
a virus site.

422
00:33:48,352 --> 00:33:50,649
What?
-A virus site, that's a good thing.

423
00:33:50,932 --> 00:33:52,399
Maybe for you.

424
00:33:52,616 --> 00:33:54,940
You and i both know,
i'm never leaving this room.

425
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:57,646
I will always..

426
00:33:57,766 --> 00:33:59,195
Be a carrier.

427
00:34:06,633 --> 00:34:08,276
I'm gonna die
in quarantine.

428
00:34:30,674 --> 00:34:32,216
Jorge, hold still.

429
00:34:33,785 --> 00:34:35,826
It's in. It's in.
It's okay.

430
00:34:36,506 --> 00:34:38,055
Give it a minute.
Give it a minute.

431
00:34:38,557 --> 00:34:39,694
Damnit.

432
00:34:40,302 --> 00:34:42,575
God damnit, get in here
and help me hold him down.

433
00:34:43,735 --> 00:34:47,007
No. Doctor, i don't think i..
-Get in here!

434
00:35:50,929 --> 00:35:52,320
No!

435
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:58,343
That is what i'm talking about.

436
00:36:00,702 --> 00:36:02,258
Penny, you don't want no steak?

437
00:36:02,378 --> 00:36:03,921
Nah, she's not hungry.

438
00:36:07,649 --> 00:36:10,109
She's okay though, right?
-Yeah, she's fine.

439
00:36:10,153 --> 00:36:12,863
Just came out of the water a little amped-crash.

440
00:36:12,983 --> 00:36:14,767
Sleeping off the jetlag
or whatever.

441
00:36:15,659 --> 00:36:17,395
Josh, can you come in here?

442
00:36:18,647 --> 00:36:19,813
Yup!

443
00:36:22,684 --> 00:36:24,190
Hope she's all clean up.

444
00:36:27,425 --> 00:36:29,574
Daddy don't like no
salty cooch.

445
00:36:29,944 --> 00:36:31,835
The shits that come out your mouth.

446
00:36:32,276 --> 00:36:33,485
Hell yeah.

447
00:36:37,673 --> 00:36:39,436
How are you two related again?

448
00:36:42,013 --> 00:36:42,780
Hike.

449
00:36:45,814 --> 00:36:46,921
Hola.

450
00:36:47,334 --> 00:36:48,275
Close the flap.

451
00:36:48,774 --> 00:36:49,925
Yeah.

452
00:36:50,895 --> 00:36:52,521
That's what i'm talking about.

453
00:36:52,641 --> 00:36:54,815
I'm not..
Look at this.

454
00:36:55,235 --> 00:36:56,468
Oh, Jesus.

455
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,269
Baby, i told you
to put on sun screen.

456
00:36:59,544 --> 00:37:00,606
I did.

457
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:06,177
What is it?

458
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,502
I don't know.

459
00:37:08,711 --> 00:37:10,623
are you allergic to salt water?

460
00:37:10,666 --> 00:37:11,897
No, i mean..

461
00:37:11,969 --> 00:37:14,557
Not before now.
Don't.

462
00:37:15,028 --> 00:37:16,447
It's like it's on fire.

463
00:37:17,975 --> 00:37:21,196
Baby, you're obviously very allergic
to something.

464
00:37:21,316 --> 00:37:24,638
But i'm gonna go get the first aid kit,
everything's gonna be okay.

465
00:37:28,697 --> 00:37:29,956
Look at your legs.

466
00:37:30,805 --> 00:37:32,217
That's how mine started.

467
00:37:33,868 --> 00:37:34,715
What?

468
00:37:34,947 --> 00:37:38,061
It's just started itching a few minutes ago
after i smoked.

469
00:37:38,937 --> 00:37:40,241
Did you have some bud?

470
00:37:40,361 --> 00:37:42,037
Yeah, before the dive.

471
00:37:42,522 --> 00:37:43,886
Hey..

472
00:37:44,725 --> 00:37:46,332
That must be what it is.

473
00:37:46,383 --> 00:37:50,178
We bought that stuff in somewhere,
we're having a little reaction to a different strain..

474
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:51,669
Baby, it's okay.

475
00:37:51,789 --> 00:37:53,751
Relax, relax.

476
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:57,515
Okay? Papi's gonna make it all better.

477
00:37:59,071 --> 00:38:00,555
You still look great.

478
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:06,206
So..

479
00:38:06,438 --> 00:38:07,632
The guy asks his wife.

480
00:38:07,857 --> 00:38:08,921
He says, baby..

481
00:38:09,264 --> 00:38:11,942
Can you tell me something
that makes me angry..

482
00:38:12,062 --> 00:38:13,578
And happy at the same time?

483
00:38:14,015 --> 00:38:15,941
His wife thinks about it
for a second.

484
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,262
She says, sure.

485
00:38:18,382 --> 00:38:20,245
You got a bigger dick
than your brother.

486
00:38:22,646 --> 00:38:24,123
It's terrible.
It's terrible dude.

487
00:38:24,243 --> 00:38:26,360
Bad attitude,
you need to lighten up.

488
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,791
You're getting married tomorrow.

489
00:38:30,122 --> 00:38:31,183
Yeah, about that.

490
00:38:32,717 --> 00:38:34,020
Take these.

491
00:38:34,876 --> 00:38:36,287
Make you feel better.

492
00:38:36,407 --> 00:38:37,735
There you go.

493
00:38:40,508 --> 00:38:42,079
That a girl.

494
00:38:44,506 --> 00:38:47,944
You just need a little distraction
until the Benadryl kicks in.

495
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,982
Now you, just relax.

496
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,944
Because the doctor..

497
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,125
Is in.

498
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:13,307
Give me your leg.

499
00:39:16,249 --> 00:39:17,096
That's it.

500
00:39:18,141 --> 00:39:19,908
It feels good?
-Yeah.

501
00:39:33,669 --> 00:39:34,973
Just laid back.

502
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,602
There you go.

503
00:40:41,891 --> 00:40:43,658
Listen, if i had a list..

504
00:40:43,716 --> 00:40:46,256
Kate would be checked out
in every box, but..

505
00:40:46,521 --> 00:40:49,445
For some reason, i think
what if there's an unfinished business out there?

506
00:40:49,894 --> 00:40:50,612
Like?

507
00:40:54,231 --> 00:40:55,656
Jesus, do they ever let up?

508
00:40:55,776 --> 00:40:56,785
I mean really?

509
00:41:01,055 --> 00:41:03,357
You remember that girl
from a few summers back?

510
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:05,759
The nympho.

511
00:41:06,511 --> 00:41:08,888
Yeah..

512
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,618
cucumber girl.

513
00:41:17,921 --> 00:41:18,565
What?

514
00:41:21,676 --> 00:41:23,536
No..
-Yeah.
-No.

515
00:41:23,656 --> 00:41:26,813
She.. You gotta be fucking..
Are you serious?

516
00:41:27,326 --> 00:41:29,484
Does Josh know?
-No.

517
00:41:29,803 --> 00:41:32,947
No and he doesn't need to know.
-Are you kidding me?

518
00:41:33,207 --> 00:41:34,900
Who are you all of the sudden.

519
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:38,581
First you're gonna sabotage our business
of two years.

520
00:41:38,789 --> 00:41:40,669
And then, on top of it all..

521
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:44,316
You're fucking your brother's girl?
-Hold on.

522
00:41:44,436 --> 00:41:46,585
Technically, he's fucking my girl.

523
00:41:46,603 --> 00:41:51,110
Your..
-Super secret ex-girl childhood friend..

524
00:41:51,146 --> 00:41:53,799
We were lab partners
all through grade 8.

525
00:41:54,089 --> 00:41:55,274
Right.

526
00:41:56,773 --> 00:41:58,501
What? We were.

527
00:42:00,754 --> 00:42:03,234
I can't believe
that's cucumber girl.

528
00:42:03,822 --> 00:42:05,234
The one with..

529
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:07,541
What is so funny about that?

530
00:42:08,906 --> 00:42:11,232
Amazing.
A-ma-zing.

531
00:42:11,277 --> 00:42:13,681
That's awesome, i can't believe..

532
00:42:13,726 --> 00:42:17,038
Does he know?
What she can do with a cucumber..

533
00:42:17,518 --> 00:42:18,499
Come on.

534
00:42:20,544 --> 00:42:23,376
Why do i tell you
these things?

535
00:42:23,496 --> 00:42:26,656
That is awesome, it makes perfect sense
now i think about it.

536
00:42:26,776 --> 00:42:30,658
She always did like salad.
-Please do not say anything to anybody.

537
00:42:30,704 --> 00:42:32,676
I shouldn't have told you that.
-What do you mean?

538
00:42:32,702 --> 00:42:34,548
That's one of the greatest things
i've ever heard.

539
00:42:34,668 --> 00:42:36,479
It's dark, let's go.

540
00:42:37,985 --> 00:42:38,941
What did i say?

541
00:42:42,471 --> 00:42:44,143
Baby, you got so wet.

542
00:43:00,501 --> 00:43:02,672
No, she did not dude.
Give me a break.

543
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:03,816
Holy fuck!

544
00:43:04,634 --> 00:43:05,829
Oh my god, Josh?

545
00:43:07,124 --> 00:43:08,799
Josh, what happened?

546
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:16,340
I think Penny's sick.

547
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:26,665
Mayday, mayday.

548
00:43:26,817 --> 00:43:28,387
Can anybody hear me?

549
00:43:29,147 --> 00:43:31,218
God damnit.
Come on.

550
00:43:32,586 --> 00:43:34,948
Come on, can anybody here me?

551
00:43:35,238 --> 00:43:38,358
Hello, mayday.
We have a medical situation.

552
00:43:38,417 --> 00:43:40,950
Can you hear me, over?
-I told you, the range is too short.

553
00:43:45,608 --> 00:43:46,999
I got no reception.
-Nothing?

554
00:43:47,035 --> 00:43:48,838
No.
-Jesus.

555
00:43:50,944 --> 00:43:52,549
Listen, Penny needs help now.

556
00:43:52,585 --> 00:43:53,852
What about the dingy?

557
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:56,341
No, we won't make it for 2 miles.

558
00:43:56,377 --> 00:43:58,939
The phone's still won't work,
the radio's still won't work.

559
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:03,812
There was a structure
on the northern side of the island.

560
00:44:04,351 --> 00:44:05,465
The one we saw
on the way over?

561
00:44:05,516 --> 00:44:08,201
Yeah, that's right.
Maybe we're not the only ones here after al.

562
00:44:09,501 --> 00:44:10,457
It's worth the shot.

563
00:44:11,788 --> 00:44:13,274
Alright, Josh.

564
00:44:13,795 --> 00:44:16,575
Take care of Penny
and stay in touch, alright?

565
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,524
We're gonna go,
we'll be back soon.

566
00:44:20,203 --> 00:44:21,492
Okay.
-Come on.

567
00:44:25,114 --> 00:44:27,271
Come on babe, let's get you back
inside the tent.

568
00:44:45,337 --> 00:44:47,755
Where the hell is this place?
-Down here, come on.

569
00:44:48,356 --> 00:44:49,803
Now you got all the answers.

570
00:44:49,847 --> 00:44:51,630
I'm trying man,
i'm trying.

571
00:44:51,666 --> 00:44:53,599
It's getting dark,
we gotta go back.

572
00:44:54,236 --> 00:44:56,169
We're not going back.
Penny needs us.

573
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,935
Penny needs us or
Penny needs you?

574
00:45:00,006 --> 00:45:01,171
What's that supposed to mean?

575
00:45:01,953 --> 00:45:03,697
It means that Penny..

576
00:45:03,817 --> 00:45:05,296
She's gonna be fine.

577
00:45:05,332 --> 00:45:07,982
She's with your brother,
her boyfriend.

578
00:45:10,978 --> 00:45:12,742
You want to go, go.

579
00:45:13,124 --> 00:45:15,230
Fine, go.
I'm staying here.

580
00:45:15,499 --> 00:45:17,620
I said i was gonna get them help,
and i'm helping them.

581
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:19,288
He's my brother, man.

582
00:45:21,851 --> 00:45:24,554
I guess i'm just on my own now,
i should get use to that.

583
00:45:24,674 --> 00:45:25,739
It's your choice.

584
00:45:25,859 --> 00:45:28,928
Yeah, just another person getting fucked by the mighty Marcus Bentley.
-It's your choice.

585
00:45:29,048 --> 00:45:30,840
Do what you want, man.

586
00:45:34,935 --> 00:45:37,007
Mark! Marky!

587
00:45:42,896 --> 00:45:44,769
I found it.
-No way.

588
00:46:03,824 --> 00:46:05,575
Hey, how you doing?

589
00:46:07,167 --> 00:46:09,031
We gotta leave the island.

590
00:46:09,529 --> 00:46:12,713
We gotta get the dingy,
and just take a chance.

591
00:46:14,115 --> 00:46:16,647
Marcus and Dobbs are out there right now.

592
00:46:16,767 --> 00:46:18,448
Looking for help, okay?

593
00:46:19,335 --> 00:46:20,484
I don't care.

594
00:46:22,206 --> 00:46:25,816
Pen, he's my brother.
I can't just leave him behind.

595
00:46:27,438 --> 00:46:28,578
Why?

596
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:30,569
He's leaving you.

597
00:46:39,575 --> 00:46:40,888
Baby, i'm..

598
00:46:41,403 --> 00:46:43,334
I'm gonna try the radio again.

599
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:44,800
For help, outside.

600
00:46:44,845 --> 00:46:46,410
Don't leave me!

601
00:47:12,494 --> 00:47:13,706
Hello?

602
00:47:17,707 --> 00:47:18,720
Hello?

603
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,230
What is that smell?

604
00:47:24,528 --> 00:47:25,809
Hello?

605
00:47:49,027 --> 00:47:49,941
Fuck!

606
00:48:06,381 --> 00:48:08,191
Penny, get back in the tent.

607
00:48:08,899 --> 00:48:10,202
It hurts.

608
00:48:10,322 --> 00:48:11,786
I need air.

609
00:48:13,387 --> 00:48:16,118
Get back in the motherfucking tent!

610
00:48:17,258 --> 00:48:18,959
You're such an asshole.

611
00:48:22,286 --> 00:48:23,906
Fuck!

612
00:48:43,335 --> 00:48:45,082
It's locked.

613
00:48:45,718 --> 00:48:48,641
If anyone's there, they obviously
don't want us getting in.

614
00:48:56,671 --> 00:48:58,207
Can we..

615
00:49:04,903 --> 00:49:06,396
God damnit.

616
00:49:17,752 --> 00:49:19,164
Doesn't look locked to me.

617
00:49:30,748 --> 00:49:31,780
Hello?

618
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:34,585
I don't think it's here.

619
00:49:36,194 --> 00:49:37,280
Hey Josh.

620
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,234
Josh, we're inside this
bunker type thing..

621
00:49:40,073 --> 00:49:43,493
We're just gonna take a look around
but it doesn't look like anyone's been here for a long time.

622
00:49:43,783 --> 00:49:44,977
Over.

623
00:49:45,097 --> 00:49:46,853
What is this place?

624
00:49:47,071 --> 00:49:48,437
Hey Josh?

625
00:49:48,708 --> 00:49:50,428
Josh, you read me?
Over.

626
00:49:51,566 --> 00:49:53,339
We're out of range.
-What?

627
00:49:53,459 --> 00:49:55,773
We're out of range.
They're not gonna hear you.

628
00:49:55,893 --> 00:49:57,001
Fuck.

629
00:49:57,121 --> 00:49:59,281
Hey Josh!
Josh!

630
00:49:59,535 --> 00:50:01,109
God damnit.

631
00:50:03,742 --> 00:50:05,416
Some of these stuff
still works.

632
00:50:05,461 --> 00:50:08,259
Maybe there's something we can use for communication, if i can get some of this working.

633
00:50:08,305 --> 00:50:10,223
I don't know man.
-I mean..

634
00:50:10,343 --> 00:50:12,603
I don't know any of this shit.
-There's obviously still power.

635
00:50:18,383 --> 00:50:19,396
Shit.

636
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:22,102
I fucked up, i'm sorry.
-That's alright.

637
00:50:22,222 --> 00:50:23,907
I fucked up.
-It's cool.

638
00:50:24,027 --> 00:50:25,645
There's gotta be some release or something.

639
00:50:25,765 --> 00:50:27,880
I think i just broke it.

640
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,289
Fuck, i'm sorry Marky.
-God damnit.

641
00:50:30,409 --> 00:50:32,650
It's alright, hey calm down!
-What are we gonna do?

642
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:36,163
Calm down? There's blood on the floor.
-Don't touch it!

643
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:39,321
Don't touch the blood.
-There's a lot of blood, i'm not touching.
-Don't touch anything!

644
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:41,004
Nothing!
-Okay.

645
00:50:41,124 --> 00:50:43,809
We gotta figure this shit out.
-Okay.

646
00:50:50,206 --> 00:50:52,359
Wait, come here.
This is a map.

647
00:50:52,386 --> 00:50:55,300
This is a map. This is a map, look!
-Okay.

648
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:58,205
This is us, this is us.

649
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:00,494
We can go down here, we can get out.
-Are you sure?

650
00:51:00,614 --> 00:51:02,423
Yeah, i'm positive.
I'm positive.

651
00:51:03,447 --> 00:51:05,736
Go get my bag,

652
00:51:06,379 --> 00:51:08,198
Dude, take the axe.
-Okay.

653
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:10,787
Get my bag, we gotta get back to Penny and Josh
and get the hell out of here.

654
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:15,153
Just don't touch anything.

655
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:18,752
I'm sorry man, i'm so sorry.
-It's alright.

656
00:51:18,872 --> 00:51:20,027

660
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:36,137
What happened in here?
-It's alright.

661
00:51:38,101 --> 00:51:40,233
Hey, it's gonna be fine.

662
00:51:40,353 --> 00:51:42,839
We're gonna save Penny and Josh, and we're gonna save ourselves.
-Okay.

663
00:51:42,959 --> 00:51:46,515
We need to get out of here right now, let's go.
-Okay.

664
00:51:58,995 --> 00:52:00,600
Marcus?

665
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,414

Are you sure we can get out?
-Step over it, just step over it.

00:55:07,741 --> 00:55:09,184
Just a little bit of blood.

00:56:49,025 --> 00:56:50,250
Anybody?

711
00:57:12,163 --> 00:57:13,275
Shit.

712
00:57:14,774 --> 00:57:17,295
What the fuck happened
in here?

713
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,870
Jesus Christ.

714
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:33,059
What was that?

715
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,719
Go!

716
00:59:45,897 --> 00:59:47,257
Go, go, come on!

717
01:01:03,356 --> 01:01:04,756
Hello?

718
01:01:05,738 --> 01:01:07,167
Help!

719
01:01:09,579 --> 01:01:10,800
Come on!

720
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:12,296
We gotta get out
this island.

721
01:01:12,316 --> 01:01:13,993
Go, go, go.
-Where?

722
01:01:14,113 --> 01:01:15,452
Turn left.
-Where?

723
01:01:15,869 --> 01:01:17,474
Stop, stop.
Left.

724
01:01:31,867 --> 01:01:33,225
Dobbs!

725
01:01:37,244 --> 01:01:38,995
Dobbs!

726
01:01:39,328 --> 01:01:40,822
Dobbs!

727
01:01:44,629 --> 01:01:46,118
Dobbs..

728
01:01:51,351 --> 01:01:52,427
Dobbs..

729
01:01:53,492 --> 01:01:54,773
Look at me.

730
01:01:55,490 --> 01:01:57,359
Dobbs, we have to go.

731
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:12,374
Dobbs!

732
01:05:13,509 --> 01:05:16,273
It's supposed to be safe
in here.

733
01:05:16,914 --> 01:05:19,499
But he got inside.

734
01:05:19,619 --> 01:05:21,324
He got us.

735
01:05:21,444 --> 01:05:22,982
What did you do
to these people?

736
01:05:23,102 --> 01:05:25,100
I'm in control.

737
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:28,870
I can't let it out this island.
-Wait, wait.

738
01:05:28,924 --> 01:05:31,924
Look, i can go get help
alright?

739
01:05:32,044 --> 01:05:34,238
I know a great plastic surgeon.

740
01:05:34,662 --> 01:05:38,591
He did my ex-girlfriend.
Great job.

741
01:05:38,711 --> 01:05:40,384
Spectacular.

742
01:05:40,807 --> 01:05:42,850
Wait, wait.
No.

743
01:05:43,092 --> 01:05:44,699
Please, please..

744
01:06:35,216 --> 01:06:38,026
Hey Dobbs, calm down.
It's me.

745
01:06:38,146 --> 01:06:40,405
What the hell happened?
Where is Marcus?

746
01:07:15,811 --> 01:07:17,071
Mark..

747
01:07:18,507 --> 01:07:19,898
He..

748
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,701
He's gone to find help.

749
01:07:22,821 --> 01:07:25,332
We need to get Marcus,
get to the doctor..

750
01:07:25,452 --> 01:07:28,427
And get to Penny, cause she's not doing
so well, man.

751
01:07:32,896 --> 01:07:33,993
No.

752
01:07:34,113 --> 01:07:36,557
No, you stay the hell
away from me.

753
01:07:36,677 --> 01:07:38,908
Why?
-Stay away.

754
01:07:43,318 --> 01:07:45,147
Marky?
Thank God, man.

755
01:07:45,267 --> 01:07:46,679
Were you gonna leave me back there?

756
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:49,590
No, i was coming back for you.
I wouldn't just let you down there.

757
01:07:49,710 --> 01:07:52,902
You locked the door.
Hey hey..

758
01:07:53,022 --> 01:07:55,205
Don't make me.
-You're gonna shoot me?

759
01:07:55,325 --> 01:07:57,903
Great bachelor party,
you're such a friend.

760
01:07:58,023 --> 01:08:01,303
Guys just settle down, okay?
We just need to get the doctor.

761
01:08:01,423 --> 01:08:04,269
He has it too, look at him.
He has it too!

762
01:08:05,949 --> 01:08:08,425
Who cares what i have?
They're waiting for her.

763
01:08:08,545 --> 01:08:12,013
Who, who's waiting for her?
-Dr Edwards, now put the gun down before i make you.

764
01:08:12,133 --> 01:08:15,869
Come on Marcus, we can take him.
-You think your brother gives a shit about you?

765
01:08:16,597 --> 01:08:18,567
He fucked your girlfriend.

766
01:08:18,871 --> 01:08:21,674
Right? Tell him Marky.
Tell him.

767
01:08:28,814 --> 01:08:31,228
It was a long time ago,
i was gonna tell you..

768
01:08:31,258 --> 01:08:32,857
I was just trying to protect you.

769
01:08:32,977 --> 01:08:34,673
You should've tried harder.

770
01:08:34,986 --> 01:08:37,068
I knew it,
i knew something was up.

771
01:08:37,188 --> 01:08:39,267
How was i suppose to know
you were gonna show up with Penny..

772
01:08:39,302 --> 01:08:41,770
I'm the one who's paying
for your broke ass to come down here..

773
01:08:41,810 --> 01:08:45,584
But not mom and dad, right?
-Guys, can we please just get out of here already?

774
01:08:45,619 --> 01:08:48,330
I only got enough patience for one family fuck-up at this wedding.

775
01:08:48,450 --> 01:08:50,629
One family fuck-up.
-You selfish fuck.

776
01:08:50,749 --> 01:08:53,618
You just can't wait to get the fuck out
of this family?

777
01:08:53,738 --> 01:08:55,710
You got damn right, damn right.

778
01:08:56,726 --> 01:09:00,576
Fucking hurts!
My nose!

779
01:09:12,009 --> 01:09:13,991
Let's get to these doctors, alright?
-Yeah.

780
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:15,233
Fuck you, man.

781
01:09:15,353 --> 01:09:18,139
I can't go back there,
you don't know what's down there.

782
01:09:18,259 --> 01:09:20,650
We got no choice.

783
01:09:20,989 --> 01:09:23,459
You feel bad about what you did before,
here's your chance.

784
01:09:23,503 --> 01:09:27,309
I'm sorry, okay?
I broke my nose.

785
01:09:27,429 --> 01:09:28,857
It's locked, guys.

786
01:09:30,656 --> 01:09:32,655
It's locked, try something.

787
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:34,504
You're smart,
figure it out.

788
01:09:35,651 --> 01:09:37,876
What do you want me to try?

789
01:09:37,996 --> 01:09:40,374
Okay, i'll try something.

790
01:09:41,321 --> 01:09:42,772
There, i tried something.

791
01:09:42,892 --> 01:09:45,157
Can we go now, please?
-Watch out.

792
01:09:49,393 --> 01:09:51,183
Hello? Dr Edwards?

793
01:09:51,661 --> 01:09:53,408
You don't know what can be down here.
-Hello?

794
01:09:54,266 --> 01:09:56,508
I don't get it.
I spoke to someone.

795
01:09:58,446 --> 01:10:00,218
Hello? Who are you?

796
01:10:00,338 --> 01:10:04,611
We have medical emergency,
Dr Edwards told us to come here.

797
01:10:04,731 --> 01:10:05,828
Really?

798
01:10:06,628 --> 01:10:08,548
Did you come by boat?
-Yeah.

799
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:13,173
We have a power outage right now,
Edward is down on the ICU.

800
01:10:13,293 --> 01:10:15,137
He's stabilizing some patients.

801
01:10:15,739 --> 01:10:17,860
He wants us to go straight to the ER.

802
01:10:17,999 --> 01:10:20,145
I can help you as long as we move fast.
-Stop!

803
01:10:20,386 --> 01:10:22,054
She's lying!

804
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:25,574
Don't listen to her.
She's one of our most highly contagious patient.

805
01:10:25,669 --> 01:10:27,653
She's the contagious one.

806
01:10:27,773 --> 01:10:31,502
She's carrying an extremely lethal strain of a flesh eating virus.

807
01:10:31,537 --> 01:10:32,771
Don't be ridiculous.

808
01:10:32,891 --> 01:10:35,778
If i'm gonna help you, we need to leave now.
-Show them your skin, Bridget.

809
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:38,256
We're wasting time, we have to go.
-Let her talk.

810
01:10:38,376 --> 01:10:41,663
She's delusional.
-Listen, we don't have time for this.

811
01:10:50,693 --> 01:10:53,486
Show them your skin,
Bridget.

812
01:11:06,490 --> 01:11:08,559
No, no, no..

813
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:11,756
Listen to me.

814
01:11:12,312 --> 01:11:14,803
Take us to
Dr Edwards..

815
01:11:15,959 --> 01:11:17,332
Now!

816
01:11:18,166 --> 01:11:19,878
Josh, let's go.
Come on.

817
01:11:19,998 --> 01:11:21,425
It's gonna be okay.

818
01:11:27,934 --> 01:11:29,211
This guy.

819
01:11:38,949 --> 01:11:40,435
My name is Dr Edwards.

820
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:44,197
There's been an incident, the rest of the staff
had been temporary removed to the evacuation tunnels..

821
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:46,031
Until we can contain
this breach.

822
01:11:46,083 --> 01:11:48,502
No, everyone in that bunker
is dead.

823
01:11:48,545 --> 01:11:50,075
What?
-Are you sure?

824
01:11:50,195 --> 01:11:51,387
How is that possible?

825
01:11:53,073 --> 01:11:55,393
Dr Edwards, please.
Penny, the girl on our boat..

826
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:57,522
We have to get you to her now.
-Excuse me?

827
01:11:58,172 --> 01:11:59,841
Didn't you respond to our
stress call?

828
01:11:59,961 --> 01:12:02,039
I wouldn't lower that gun.
-You don't move.

829
01:12:02,919 --> 01:12:05,674
He lured you here under false pretenses,
he's gonna take your boat..

830
01:12:05,752 --> 01:12:08,133
And he's gonna leave you behind.
-That's ridiculous.
-No.

831
01:12:08,564 --> 01:12:10,059
Every one of these hazmat suits..

832
01:12:10,179 --> 01:12:12,961
Is equipped with a small high power radio system
in the right sleeve.

833
01:12:13,306 --> 01:12:16,556
It's radio, it doesn't have enough power
to reach the mainland.

834
01:12:16,676 --> 01:12:18,616
It's tiny.
-Yeah? How about the beach?

835
01:12:19,309 --> 01:12:21,881
This award winning scholar
gets off the island all by himself..

836
01:12:22,001 --> 01:12:24,575
And no one knows
that he is responsible.

837
01:12:25,285 --> 01:12:27,744
You piece of shit.
-What happens to us?

838
01:12:27,864 --> 01:12:29,904
What happens to us?
-That's a fabrication.

839
01:12:29,939 --> 01:12:31,851
Very good fabrication, Porter.

840
01:12:31,886 --> 01:12:35,075
He'd throw anyone of you under the bus
if he thought that suit is needed, isn't that right Bridget?

841
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:38,931
Josh, take his gun.

842
01:12:39,557 --> 01:12:42,127
Wait, let's all just try
and use our heads..

843
01:12:42,170 --> 01:12:44,829
Just think for a second.
Just think!

844
01:12:45,082 --> 01:12:47,395
Did he get it from
the bunker too?

845
01:12:49,655 --> 01:12:52,121
We went snorkling in the beach,
that's all.

846
01:12:54,415 --> 01:12:55,788
Jesus Christ.

847
01:12:56,851 --> 01:12:58,641
Everything in that water was dead.

848
01:12:59,632 --> 01:13:02,291
Did you know about this?
-Of course not.

849
01:13:02,411 --> 01:13:03,942
This isn't my facility.

850
01:13:04,062 --> 01:13:07,122
Maybe there's a sanitation line that went into the ocean, maybe not.

851
01:13:07,242 --> 01:13:09,339
Am i suppose to know
where they keep the trash?

852
01:13:09,459 --> 01:13:12,128
If a virus of this magnitude
was allowed to escape..

853
01:13:12,172 --> 01:13:14,670
And becomes a pandemic..
-Pandemic?

854
01:13:15,208 --> 01:13:16,825
The guy who
created the vaccine..

855
01:13:16,945 --> 01:13:18,120
Will be a hero.

856
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:19,514
I'm not trying to
be a hero..

857
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:22,399
I'm trying to save lives.
-That's why Porter's so important to you.

858
01:13:22,519 --> 01:13:24,338
He's the key
to the vaccine.

859
01:13:24,573 --> 01:13:26,111
To your legacy.

860
01:13:26,381 --> 01:13:29,075
We're all getting the hell out
of this place, come on.

861
01:13:29,195 --> 01:13:30,454
You don't understand.

862
01:13:30,574 --> 01:13:32,340
I don't understand?
-No, you don't understand.

863
01:13:32,374 --> 01:13:35,047
Listen to me,
we're getting my brother back on that boat..

864
01:13:35,082 --> 01:13:36,603
And we're doing it right now, okay?

865
01:13:36,646 --> 01:13:38,662
If the system keeps slushing
itself out..

866
01:13:38,782 --> 01:13:40,702
It won't be long until
it reaches mainland.

867
01:13:40,745 --> 01:13:42,370
We're talking about
an outbreak.

868
01:13:42,405 --> 01:13:44,218
On a massive scale.

869
01:13:45,947 --> 01:13:48,326
Please, we need to shut it down
immediately.

870
01:13:48,353 --> 01:13:51,863
Listen, i promise you we will send 
the whole army to clean up this place..

871
01:13:51,889 --> 01:13:56,364
No, we don't have to wait for that,
every facility is engineered with a fail-safe scenario.

872
01:13:57,850 --> 01:14:00,205
Like a self destruct system?

873
01:14:00,753 --> 01:14:03,438
Please, we can stop this right here,
right now.

874
01:14:03,558 --> 01:14:04,542
Josh.

875
01:14:06,054 --> 01:14:08,896
Josh, josh..
You go back to the boat..

876
01:14:09,016 --> 01:14:11,470
You take care of Penny, she's gonna be fine.
-Okay.

877
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:13,869
Wait, i'm coming with you.
I can help.

878
01:14:15,379 --> 01:14:16,317
Dobbs..

879
01:14:16,361 --> 01:14:18,142
You keep an eye on
Dr. Evil.

880
01:14:18,629 --> 01:14:19,712
Okay?

881
01:14:21,615 --> 01:14:23,032
You, let's go.

882
01:14:23,825 --> 01:14:25,077
Let's go.

883
01:14:25,389 --> 01:14:27,258
Come on, keep going.

884
01:14:27,458 --> 01:14:30,203
Let's go.
-Come on, don't fuck around, man!

885
01:14:30,323 --> 01:14:32,480
Jesus Christ!
-Let's go.

886
01:14:34,478 --> 01:14:35,362
Come on.

887
01:14:49,514 --> 01:14:52,010
If we're not back when the boat gets here,
just set sail.

888
01:14:52,758 --> 01:14:53,618
Marky..

889
01:14:53,738 --> 01:14:54,887
Marky..

890
01:14:56,008 --> 01:14:57,215
Listen to me.

891
01:14:57,335 --> 01:14:58,979
Just get Josh
somewhere safe.

892
01:14:59,614 --> 01:15:01,308
Hey, please.

893
01:15:05,256 --> 01:15:06,621
Porter.

894
01:15:07,081 --> 01:15:09,375
We may need your help.
-Let's go, come on.

895
01:15:14,795 --> 01:15:16,202
You heard him,
let's go.

896
01:15:20,746 --> 01:15:23,230
What can they do for us in the ER anyway?

897
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:25,870
Dr Edwards has been working on a virus site.
-A what?

898
01:15:25,990 --> 01:15:27,442
Virus killer.

899
01:15:27,562 --> 01:15:31,049
If we can make it to the CDC facility in time,
they might be able to bind it.

900
01:15:34,374 --> 01:15:37,000
You don't look so good,
relax..

901
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:38,520
Breathe..

902
01:15:39,285 --> 01:15:40,945
Breathe, where's your boat?

903
01:15:41,753 --> 01:15:44,607
It's waiting for us on the beach
just over there.

904
01:15:58,225 --> 01:16:00,764
Wait, wait,
we can't go in there.

905
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:02,850
It's contaminated.

906
01:16:03,539 --> 01:16:04,660
It's conta..

907
01:16:06,928 --> 01:16:08,153
Oh God.

908
01:16:09,325 --> 01:16:11,862
We still have to shut down
the minor release.

909
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:14,148
I'll do it.

910
01:16:52,010 --> 01:16:54,386
You won't be able to conceal
those hives much longer.

911
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:57,671
I told you to shut up.

912
01:16:58,546 --> 01:17:01,849
Do you have any idea
what's the next phase of this virus is?

913
01:17:02,439 --> 01:17:05,998
Horrible blistering pain
as those hives weld up.

914
01:17:06,250 --> 01:17:10,017
Followed by fever and grotesque
postuils on your thighs..

915
01:17:10,044 --> 01:17:12,199
Your mid sections, your face.
And then..

916
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:14,050
Your tissues start necrotizing.

917
01:17:15,093 --> 01:17:16,857
If you want to survive this virus..

918
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:19,255
You've got to let me asses
its progress.

919
01:17:19,472 --> 01:17:20,601
Okay?

920
01:17:23,591 --> 01:17:26,203
If you try anything,
i swear i will kill you.

921
01:17:26,524 --> 01:17:28,193
I swear.
-Okay.

922
01:17:28,975 --> 01:17:29,898
Okay.

923
01:17:31,114 --> 01:17:32,218
Lower the gun.

924
01:17:33,765 --> 01:17:34,947
Put the gun down.

925
01:17:35,163 --> 01:17:36,866
Thank you.
This arm.

926
01:17:40,029 --> 01:17:42,039
Doesn't look like it's that advanced.

927
01:17:49,391 --> 01:17:51,616
Turns out your condition is fatal.

928
01:17:57,602 --> 01:17:58,749
Okay Porter.

929
01:17:58,869 --> 01:18:00,852
Now you have to put
this code into the keypad.

930
01:18:01,990 --> 01:18:03,170
Alpha.

931
01:18:03,466 --> 01:18:04,596
Romeo.

932
01:18:04,874 --> 01:18:06,073
Foxtrot.

933
01:18:06,193 --> 01:18:08,843
1-2-3.

934
01:18:12,087 --> 01:18:13,825
That's it,
it's armed.

935
01:18:15,368 --> 01:18:17,011
There's no turning back, is there?
-No.

936
01:18:18,654 --> 01:18:20,035
Come on, let's get to the beach.

937
01:18:20,079 --> 01:18:23,507
We have to clear the blast radius
before this place goes sky high.

938
01:18:44,203 --> 01:18:45,498
Who are you?

939
01:18:51,578 --> 01:18:53,325
I'm a doctor.

940
01:18:53,759 --> 01:18:55,694
I'm here to take you to the hospital.

941
01:18:56,068 --> 01:18:57,571
Where's Josh?

942
01:18:59,430 --> 01:19:00,890
You must be Penny.

943
01:19:01,942 --> 01:19:03,923
I already took care of Josh.

944
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:07,327
I've been ordered to
transport you.

945
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:09,430
By who?

946
01:19:12,905 --> 01:19:14,183
By who!

947
01:19:29,744 --> 01:19:31,957
Look, you might need a referral.

948
01:19:40,742 --> 01:19:42,987
Don't you fucking touch me!

949
01:20:10,418 --> 01:20:11,721
You're one ugly bitch.

950
01:23:02,174 --> 01:23:04,833
Dobbs, Edwards!
We gotta get..

951
01:23:07,674 --> 01:23:10,059
No, no..

952
01:23:21,726 --> 01:23:23,049
Josh!

953
01:23:41,065 --> 01:23:41,967
Josh..

954
01:23:42,203 --> 01:23:43,467
Josh?

955
01:24:08,099 --> 01:24:10,231
There's nothing you could've done.

956
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:15,251
Edwards!

957
01:24:20,092 --> 01:24:22,729
Edwards, where are you,
you son of a bitch?

958
01:24:34,369 --> 01:24:36,662
You son of a bitch,
where are you?

959
01:24:48,443 --> 01:24:49,446
Watch out!

960
01:24:50,989 --> 01:24:52,809
Change of plans.
-Why?

961
01:24:52,929 --> 01:24:55,152
What are the two rules
of containment?

962
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:56,695
Isolate the exposed..

963
01:24:56,815 --> 01:24:58,684
Quarantine the sick.
-Exactly.

964
01:24:58,726 --> 01:25:00,899
Which is why he can never leave
this island.

965
01:25:01,658 --> 01:25:03,765
But he's not sick!
-Really?

966
01:25:03,885 --> 01:25:07,146
Everyone else on his boat was contaminated.
-What about Dobbs?

967
01:25:07,266 --> 01:25:09,496
What about Dobbs, you killed him
not the virus.

968
01:25:09,530 --> 01:25:13,441
You killed him!
-I spare him from an agonizing death.

969
01:25:13,561 --> 01:25:15,805
You saw what was happening to
your brother.

970
01:25:15,852 --> 01:25:16,645
Stop!

971
01:25:22,832 --> 01:25:24,180
Stop!

972
01:25:24,631 --> 01:25:26,418
You can't do this!

973
01:25:26,538 --> 01:25:28,803
You need to take your emotions
out of this.

974
01:25:29,682 --> 01:25:33,576
I'm offering you the opportunity
of a life time.

975
01:25:34,005 --> 01:25:37,053
This moment could determine
your career.

976
01:25:38,123 --> 01:25:39,404
Your life.

977
01:25:41,111 --> 01:25:42,510
All you have to do..

978
01:25:42,630 --> 01:25:44,634
Is follow my lead.

979
01:25:48,486 --> 01:25:51,631
Am i the only one who has the courage
to do what's necessary?

980
01:25:51,751 --> 01:25:54,252
What's right?
-Porter, do something!

981
01:25:54,372 --> 01:25:56,869
I'm the only chance he has
of seeing his wife again.

982
01:26:02,094 --> 01:26:03,355
Porter.

983
01:26:03,475 --> 01:26:05,108
Your wife's already dead.

984
01:26:23,972 --> 01:26:24,992
Together..

985
01:26:26,265 --> 01:26:28,945
We could've stopped this virus
of its track.

986
01:26:30,507 --> 01:26:33,440
You think your immunity can protect you?

987
01:26:34,853 --> 01:26:35,856
That you're..

988
01:26:39,416 --> 01:26:41,279
That you're some sort of god?

989
01:26:49,028 --> 01:26:50,275
You're nothing but a..

990
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:52,678
Rat.

991
01:26:52,881 --> 01:26:54,305
A sinking ship.

992
01:27:10,925 --> 01:27:12,281
You know, doctor?

993
01:27:14,362 --> 01:27:17,278
Sometimes it's necessary
to harm one..

994
01:27:18,260 --> 01:27:20,418
In hopes of saving millions.

995
01:28:09,539 --> 01:28:11,098
What happened to your friends?

996
01:28:36,646 --> 01:28:38,668
I thought you guys
could use a drink.

997
01:28:41,471 --> 01:28:43,219
Any luck with the radio?

998
01:28:43,339 --> 01:28:45,337
No, we should be in radio range soon.

999
01:28:47,675 --> 01:28:49,453
I'm gonna get some fresh air.

1000
01:28:58,056 --> 01:28:59,594
To think..

1001
01:28:59,994 --> 01:29:02,309
All because of a little mouse.

1002
01:29:02,429 --> 01:29:03,816
What?

1003
01:29:04,869 --> 01:29:07,534
At the bunker,
the pictures.

1004
01:29:07,654 --> 01:29:09,824
Photos,
whole bunch of them.

1005
01:29:09,944 --> 01:29:12,574
They traced it back
to a mouse.

1006
01:29:13,101 --> 01:29:15,018
That's what it looks like
anyway.

1007
01:29:23,783 --> 01:29:25,100
Porter.

1008
01:29:28,292 --> 01:29:30,918
Porter..
-What about Porter?

1009
01:29:31,677 --> 01:29:35,238
Three blind mice,
three blind mice.

1010
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:40,765
Oh my God.
-Wait, what is going on here?

1011
01:29:41,249 --> 01:29:42,448
Porter..

1012
01:29:42,568 --> 01:29:45,051
Oh my God, the water.
-What water?

1013
01:30:29,821 --> 01:30:31,233
Captain Maggio?

1014
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:34,014
Captain Maggio?

1015
01:30:37,343 --> 01:30:38,660
Oh God.

1016
01:30:46,505 --> 01:30:47,738
Shit.

1017
01:30:50,713 --> 01:30:52,756
Why would he want to
infect us?

1018
01:30:55,106 --> 01:30:57,814
We're the only ones left
who know who he is.

1019
01:31:00,037 --> 01:31:02,766
How much water did you drink?

1020
01:31:04,230 --> 01:31:06,316
How much water did you drink?

1021
01:31:06,436 --> 01:31:07,759
Oh God.

1022
01:31:08,486 --> 01:31:09,916
Oh no.

1023
01:31:10,864 --> 01:31:12,107
No.

1024
01:31:17,537 --> 01:31:19,265
The dingy, where's the dingy?

1025
01:31:19,385 --> 01:31:20,824
Porter took it.

1026
01:31:21,646 --> 01:31:23,016
He's gone!

1027
01:31:24,991 --> 01:31:26,814
Porter!

1028
01:31:29,226 --> 01:31:30,601
Porter!

1029
01:33:18,230 --> 01:33:22,098
Where are you located,
and what's the nature of your medical emergency?

1030
01:34:17,895 --> 01:34:24,638
