1
00:00:00,918 --> 00:00:03,086
I'm not going to
unbuckle your pants yet.

2
00:00:03,212 --> 00:00:04,755
Let's get you in.

3
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,975
Miss Mary Ann Fisher,
ladies and gentlemen.

4
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:23,106
Wait till you see what I got
in the goodie bag.

5
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,233
Goodie bag?

6
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:25,817
Gonna fly you to
the moon, baby.

7
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:27,402
Let me get
your hand, Ray.

8
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:30,197
There go three.
That's for you.

9
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:32,950
I thought you was
my friend, Fathead.

10
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,326
The weight is off.

11
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,245
Don't start with me, Ray.

12
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:37,371
The weight is off.

13
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:38,497
It ain't off.

14
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,666
When you get high, man,
and you try to cop,

15
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,292
those dealers spank your ass.

16
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:43,961
You gotta have
more discipline.

17
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:47,965
You know what, man?
I ain't messing up
my high tonight,

18
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:50,968
sitting here with you,
arguing about nothin'.

19
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:55,931
Look, Fathead,
just tie me off.

20
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:58,267
Come on, Fathead. Fat.

21
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:02,855
Take care of
your bad self,
you know so damn much.

22
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,315
Later, Margie.

23
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,526
Bye, Fathead.

24
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,572
Damn.

25
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:19,246
Ain't nothing free
in this world but Jesus.

26
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:26,587
Hey, Margie.

27
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,839
Yeah?
What do you want?

28
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:31,884
Do me a favor, sweetheart,
and... and pick that up for me.

29
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,720
You're going to
have to get me off.

30
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:39,016
I'll do it,
if you let me try some.

31
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,184
Shit. No, honey.

32
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,977
This ain't for
no little girls.

33
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:43,979
I ain't no little girl!

34
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,315
I understand.
It's just that this stuff

35
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:49,359
will take you places
that you don't want to go.

36
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:51,320
See, I want to share
that with you.

37
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,738
Listen to me!

38
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:54,740
If I ever hear about you
doing some drugs

39
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,742
you're through, you hear me?

40
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:59,077
You believe that
more than you
believe in Jesus!

41
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:02,080
Don't say that,
Ray.

42
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,626
Ray!

43
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,754
Ray, I watch your show
every single night.

44
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,882
And every night
is new to me.

45
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:14,218
Maybe because
it's new to you.

46
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:18,180
It's like you live
every single word

47
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:21,517
and then you
bend some crazy note,

48
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,229
And damn if you
don't break my heart.

49
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,648
You got genius, baby.

50
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,526
I just want to
be a part of that.

51
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:32,694
Just want to be
a part of that.

52
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,988
# You know the night time,
darling #

53
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:36,323
# Night and day #

54
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:37,533
# Is the right time #

55
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:38,784
# Night and day #

56
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:40,661
# To be #

57
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:41,703
# Night and day #

58
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,539
# With the one you love, now #

59
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,249
# Night and day #

60
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:46,625
# Say now oh baby #

61
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:47,960
# Night and day #

62
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:49,962
# When I come home baby, now #

63
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,004
# Night and day #

64
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:52,798
# I want you to hold my hand #

65
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,216
# Night and day #

66
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:55,926
# Yeah, tight as you can #

67
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,511
# Night and day #

68
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,221
# I know the night time #

69
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:00,514
# Night and day #

70
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:02,683
# Whoa, is the right time #

71
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:03,725
# Night and day #

72
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,394
# To be with the one
you love, now #

73
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,562
# Night and day #

74
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:08,438
# You know what
I'm thinking of #

75
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:09,731
# Night and day #

76
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:11,275
# Whoa!
Sing your song, Margie #

77
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,734
# Night and day #

78
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,403
# Baby #

79
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,029
# Night and day #

80
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,573
# Baby #

81
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,032
# Night and day #

82
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:20,659
# Oh, baby #

83
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,411
# Night and day #

84
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,954
# Do I love you? #

85
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:25,455
# Night and day #

86
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,166
# No one above you #

87
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:28,667
# Night and day #

88
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:29,710
# Hold me tight #

89
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:32,588
Look at him.
Look at his
knees shaking.

90
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,423
He's got that
junkie itch.

91
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:35,716
# Because the night time #

92
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,426
He's totally hooked.

93
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:39,595
# Oh, is the right time #

94
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,014
Yeah, but listen
to that sound.
He's brilliant.

95
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:44,057
You can never trust
a junkie, man.

96
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:46,476
What do you want me to do?
Listen to him, man.

97
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:48,187
# I said baby #

98
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:49,855
# Night and day #

99
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,315
# Baby #

100
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,900
# Night and day #

101
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:54,610
# Baby #

102
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,195
# Night and day #

103
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,738
# Oh, baby #

104
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:58,906
# Night and day #

105
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:00,324
Happy birthday!

106
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,159
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday, Ray!

107
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:04,036
You know what to do.

108
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,496
Take a deep breath.
Go ahead.

109
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,042
He blow them out?

110
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:11,168
Every single one.

111
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,212
# I know the night time #

112
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,796
# Night and day #

113
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,590
# Everyday is the right time #

114
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:18,091
# Night and day #

115
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:20,802
# Night and day #

116
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:21,929
# You know #

117
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,388
# Night and day #

118
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:30,812
You know what,
I... I just want to
thank you so very much.

119
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:34,691
Please, uh,
another round of applause
for Miss Margie Hendricks.

120
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,945
Thank you so much,
and good night.

121
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,114
Hey, you see
what time it is?

122
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,241
What's the problem?

123
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:44,618
The problem is
on the contract.
That's the problem.

124
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,996
Ray! Ray! You still
got 20 minutes left.

125
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,373
Okay, what you want to do?

126
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,000
That fool's holding us
to every second
of the contract.

127
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:54,419
Go... go baby-sit him.
I'll take care of it.

128
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:55,796
It's okay.

129
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:58,632
You know what, they say
we got a little bit
more work to do.

130
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:00,384
That was the last song
in the book, Ray.

131
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:02,636
You know, Fathead,
it ain't never the last song.

132
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:05,305
Now, band, follow me
and do what I do,
say what I say.

133
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:06,974
This is how we gonna do it.

134
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:44,136
# Hey mama,
don't you treat me wrong #

135
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:46,597
# Come and love your daddy
all night long #

136
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,600
# It's all right #

137
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:52,311
# Whoa, it's all right #

138
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:54,605
# Hey, hey, hey, yeah #

139
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:59,318
# See the girl
with the diamond ring #

140
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,029
# She knows how to
shake that thing #

141
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:07,743
# Whoa, it's all right #

142
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,620
# Hey, hey, hey, yeah #

143
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,672
That's what I'm talking about.

144
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,390
# Tell your mama,
tell your pa #

145
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,101
# I'm gonna send you back
to Arkansas #

146
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,104
# Oh yes, ma'am,
you don't do right #

147
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,649
# Don't do right #

148
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:43,987
# What'd I say? #

149
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,532
# Tell me what'd I say #

150
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:49,618
# Tell me what'd I say #

151
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,370
Where can I get
that record from?

152
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,372
I don't know.
It doesn't exist yet.

153
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,249
I'll tell Ray
he should record it.

154
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,251
# Oh, no #

155
00:06:58,669 --> 00:06:59,711
# Mmm #

156
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,380
# Mmm #

157
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,673
# Ooh #

158
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:04,007
# Ooh #

159
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:05,133
# Eee #
# Eee #

160
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:06,552
# Ooh #
# Ooh #

161
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:10,514
# It's all right #

162
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:12,099
# Baby, it's all right #

163
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:13,642
# Baby, it's all right #

164
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:15,978
# Oh, it's all right #
# Baby, it's all right #

165
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,563
# Mama, it's all right #

166
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,022
# Baby, it's all right #

167
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,107
# It's all right #

168
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,149
# It's all right #

169
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:23,235
# It's all right, now #

170
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:27,114
Yeah, that's it.

171
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:30,284
Oh, this is it.

172
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:36,165
I'm telling you,
that is out of sight.
That's a hit.

173
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:39,459
It's fantastic, Ray.
But what the hell are we
gonna do with this?

174
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:40,544
It's too damn long.

175
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:43,589
Every night we play this, man,
we bring the house down.

176
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:44,715
I'm telling you,
it's guaranteed.

177
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,592
Tom, cut the playback!

178
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:48,260
Come on out here.

179
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:49,720
# Baby, it's all right #

180
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:52,181
You know what, Ray,
you're probably right.

181
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:53,432
I mean,
I'm sure you're right.

182
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,309
I've never heard
a sound like this before.

183
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,186
But how the hell are
we gonna market this?

184
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,897
We could cut the second verse,
pop back into the chorus.

185
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:02,274
Man, you cut that,
I'll cut you in half.

186
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,860
All right, all right,
Ray. Ahem.

187
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,571
We could, uh,
split it up.

188
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:10,073
Do a Side AISide B
type of thing.

189
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,075
It's been done before.
What the hell, right?

190
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:13,202
Yeah.

191
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,288
It's s-sexual.

192
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,290
It's just too
damn sexual for kids.

193
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:19,625
Let's do it.

194
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,752
Yeah, baby!
That's why
I love y'all, man.

195
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:24,087
All right. What the hell?
It's Atlantic, right?

196
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:25,172
Atlantic!

197
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:26,381
We'll release it
in the summer.

198
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:28,091
There's less censorship,
school's out.

199
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:29,927
The kids are ready
to kick loose.

200
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:31,762
Ha, okay!

201
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:37,100
Tom, let's see
if we can cut
this pumpkin in two.

202
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:39,102
Show me what your
genius is all about.

203
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,395
You got it, boss.

204
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:44,316
Yeah, that is it.
You put one on Side A,
put another on Side B.

205
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:45,651
Man, that sounds
out of sight.

206
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:46,818
How you feeling, Ray?

207
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:48,403
I feel groovy, baby.

208
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:51,240
I'm talking about the junk.
What?

209
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,242
It's starting
to show.

210
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,536
You're scratching
all the time.

211
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:56,828
You can't sit still.

212
00:08:57,663 --> 00:08:59,957
Hey, man, have I ever
missed a date?

213
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,792
No, you never have.

214
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:04,127
Who's the one
who delivers a record
in one take, hmm?

215
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,421
Ray, you deliver better
than anybody I know

216
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:08,966
but I'm not talking to you
as a businessman.

217
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,009
Now come on,
listen to me.

218
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:13,679
I'm worried about you.

219
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:17,641
As a friend,
I'm telling you, man,
your slip is hanging.

220
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,143
"Your slip is hanging."

221
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:23,689
You been hanging out
with us country boys
too much, man.

222
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:27,234
Uh, don't worry about this,
man. If this monkey gets
too heavy on my back,

223
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:29,987
I'll get an organ grinder,
man, and put him to work.

224
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:33,866
# One more time #

225
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:35,701
# One more time #

226
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:36,994
He's off the Chitlin' Circuit.

227
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:40,289
Down Beat voted him
Best Male Jazz Vocalist
by a 2-to-1 margin.

228
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:42,708
Well, if you want to keep him
in Philadelphia,

229
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,459
you're going to find him
a bigger venue.

230
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,261
# Make me feel so good #

231
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:56,597
What'd I Say!

232
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:59,183
# Make me feel so good #

233
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:01,310
# Make me feel so good #

234
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:02,769
# Make me feel so good, yeah #

235
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:03,854
Forget second billing.

236
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:06,440
Ray Charles headlines
at a thousand per
or no deal.

237
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:09,151
# Make me feel so good, yeah #

238
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:10,194
Terrific.

239
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:21,747
# Make me feel so fine #

240
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,332
# Make me feel so fine #

241
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:24,583
# Make me feel so fine #

242
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,043
# Make me feel so fine #

243
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:27,628
# Baby, it's all right #

244
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,046
# Baby, it's all right #

245
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,340
Ray, I'm... I'm having
second thoughts about this.

246
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,342
I don't... I don't know
nobody in I.A.

247
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:36,053
Bea, I don't want my kids
growing up in the South.

248
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:40,307
Now, I.A. Is where,
you know, a Negro can
spread his wings and fly.

249
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:43,227
Ray, my whole family's
in Texas.

250
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,395
That's why
we're moving to I.A.

251
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:48,315
Tell you what, Jeff,
tell the boys
they can go ahead

252
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:49,900
and start their
vacation right now.

253
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:52,402
All right, boss.
Once I get you inside.

254
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,364
# Make me feel all right #

255
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,950
Look at that
huge coconut tree!

256
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:00,369
That ain't
no coconut tree, Della.
That's a palm tree.

257
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,411
There's thousands
of them.

258
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:03,539
Okay.

259
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:05,833
Here's the keys
to your life,
a brand-new life.

260
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:10,212
Oh, Ray.

261
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,300
Ray, this is too much.

262
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:17,553
Have you seen
the dining room?

263
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,683
But, baby,
it's October.

264
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:24,685
But you know what,
I wanted to
celebrate early,

265
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:27,396
because the band
is gonna be playing
during the holidays.

266
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:30,941
You are unbelievable.

267
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:32,025
Look at your presents.

268
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:33,986
Baby, look at what
Santa brought you.

269
00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:35,237
You must have been good.

270
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,656
Go ahead!
Christmas is early,
baby!

271
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:38,866
Go get it.

272
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,158
What's he taken?
A guitar.

273
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:41,952
A musician just
like your daddy.

274
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:43,120
Can you play?

275
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:45,998
Hello?

276
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,583
What else you got?

277
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:48,750
What's that?

278
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:49,960
How'd you get this number?

279
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:52,588
How do you think I got it?

280
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:54,256
Put Ray on the phone.

281
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:58,427
Ray, telephone.

282
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:00,012
Deal with it, man.

283
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:02,764
Ray, it's important.
Telephone.

284
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:04,725
I-I'll be right back.

285
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,018
All right.

286
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:08,187
Who is it?

287
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:10,606
It's Margie, man.

288
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:17,321
Junior, come... come
and help your mama
change your brother's diaper.

289
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:18,780
I don't want to go.

290
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:20,365
I want to stay and
open my presents.

291
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:22,034
All right, come on!
I don't want to go.

292
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,994
I don't care.
Don't let me tell you twice.

293
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:25,621
Hello.
Hey, baby.

294
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:29,374
Surprise! I came to I.A.
To surprise you.

295
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,043
Surprise me?
Are you out of your mind?

296
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,503
I'm with my wife
and my kids.

297
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:34,922
Well, on the road,
I'm Mrs. Ray Charles.

298
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:36,089
That's on the road.

299
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:39,760
Yeah, but, baby, come on,
I got everything
set up for us.

300
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:42,012
Did you hear what
I just said to you, huh?

301
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:44,765
Oh, wait a minute,
baby, look,
I got a bottle of Bols, and...

302
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:47,768
Shut up. Shut up.
Listen, we record in
two weeks, okay?

303
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:48,810
I'll see you then.

304
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:50,896
Wait a minute, Ray!
Bye.

305
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:52,189
Ray!

306
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:58,987
# One of these days,
and it won't be long #

307
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:04,117
# You're gonna look for me #

308
00:13:04,243 --> 00:13:07,079
# and I'll be gone #

309
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:08,664
# 'Cause I believe #

310
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:11,792
# I believe, yes #

311
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:15,504
# I say I believe right now #

312
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:17,798
# I believe #

313
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,967
# Yes I believe #

314
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:24,805
# Well I believe
to my soul now #

315
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:28,308
# You're tryin' to make
a fool of me #

316
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:32,855
# I believe, yes I believe #

317
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:34,398
Hold on, wait, wait.

318
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,733
Cut, cut, cut.
You know, y'all know
that sounds off.

319
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:39,278
Ahem, you know what,
the three-part harmony is off.

320
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:42,155
Let's start it
all over again, uh,
from the top with the band.

321
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:46,869
# I believe it,
I believe it #

322
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:49,037
Whoa, pardner!
Uh, what was that?

323
00:13:49,288 --> 00:13:51,999
I knew you'd like that,
Ray. It's an eight-track.
We just got it.

324
00:13:52,124 --> 00:13:53,959
We can record
each part separately.

325
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:56,712
Whoa, Nellie! You know,
I can't wait to see that.

326
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,423
What's so funny?

327
00:13:59,548 --> 00:14:00,966
Nothing, "pardner."

328
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:03,886
Margie's drunk. Jeff?

329
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,139
You should go home
and sleep it off.

330
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:09,183
Margie, come on now,
let me take you home.

331
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:11,310
No! I'll leave when I'm good
and goddamn ready!

332
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:13,020
She's good and goddamn
ready right now.

333
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:15,314
Why don't you make me
leave this, sucker!

334
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:17,858
Teach you to treat me
like some piece of meat!

335
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:19,902
I ain't shutting up!

336
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:21,612
Should we get in there?
No.

337
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,030
Get them all out, right now.

338
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:24,364
You'll have to make me leave!

339
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:27,326
You know what, Jeff?
Get all of them out of here.

340
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:29,495
You're a cold-ass bastard!

341
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:30,746
Let go of me, Jeff!

342
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,623
You're a cold-ass bastard,
Ray!

343
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:36,293
See, he wouldn't spit on me
if my ass was on fire!

344
00:14:36,335 --> 00:14:37,461
Damn right I wouldn't.

345
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:39,588
Put me down, Jeff!
Put me down! Damn it!

346
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:41,215
You dropped your shoe.

347
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:45,636
All right, come on,
let's get back to work.

348
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:47,513
Tom, this is
what I want you to do.

349
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:50,057
We'll lay my vocals down
and finish the harmony parts.

350
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:52,643
Uh, how're we gonna do
the harmonies, Ray?

351
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:53,769
You sent the girls home.

352
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,230
I know what I did
with the girls.
Let me take care of that.

353
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:59,233
You just turn that
eight-track on, and I'll do
the girls' parts myself.

354
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:02,236
And go out here
somewhere and find me
an "Oh, Johnny" girl.

355
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:04,238
Uh, one minute.

356
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:06,782
What the hell's
an "Oh, Johnny" girl?

357
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:08,534
I think I've got an idea.

358
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:12,830
# Last night
you were dreaming #

359
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:15,666
# and I heard you say #

360
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:19,419
# Oh, Johnny! #

361
00:15:19,545 --> 00:15:22,840
# When you know
my name is Ray #

362
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:24,550
# That's why
I believe right now #

363
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:26,343
# I believe #

364
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,638
# Yes I believe #

365
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,348
# I say I believe right now #

366
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,851
# I believe #

367
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:36,979
# Yes I believe #

368
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:39,690
The sky's the limit, Ray.

369
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:41,859
I got you
a $5,000-a-night raise.

370
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,944
They're gonna up you
to 15 per.

371
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:45,529
Rehearsal in
10 minutes.

372
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:47,364
Jeff, could you get
me some cigarettes?

373
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,283
Okay, boss.

374
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:53,162
15 per, huh?

375
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:57,416
You know, Ray,
your contract with Atlantic
is expiring in four months.

376
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:58,750
Yeah.

377
00:15:58,876 --> 00:16:00,752
Yeah, I've got
the contract with me.

378
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:02,880
They're going to
double my royalties.

379
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,882
Before we jump back
in that pond,

380
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:07,176
I thought I'd find out
what else was out there.

381
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:10,888
I had a very productive chat
with ABC-Paramount yesterday.

382
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:12,890
ABC? Who told you
to do that, huh?

383
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:16,018
And you know,
Atlantic is family,
just like the Shaw Agency.

384
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:18,478
Ray, my job is to get you
the best deal possible.

385
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:21,148
ABC is very interested.

386
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,191
No.

387
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:26,195
How interested?

388
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:31,992
How about
a $50,000 advance
each year for three years?

389
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:34,161
You produce
your own records.

390
00:16:34,495 --> 00:16:37,039
They'll deduct recording costs
and give you

391
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:39,041
75 percent.

392
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:45,589
Ahmet and Jerry are
flying in tonight,

393
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:49,468
so will you put them off
until I can talk
things out with ABC?

394
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:54,056
Well, my mama said,
ain't nothing wrong
with talking.

395
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:56,225
Hey, enough of
the formalities.

396
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:58,227
Come on, let's go back
into the office, Ray.

397
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,353
I hope I can call you Ray.

398
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:00,896
I want you to be
comfortable here.

399
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:04,024
Because I'll tell you
something, everything is
gonna be better at ABC.

400
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:05,943
Moving from an indie label
to a major

401
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:07,653
means you can sell
a lot more records,

402
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:11,073
as well as attract
much larger crowds,
both white and Negro.

403
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:14,701
Yeah, but Mr. Clark,
you know, I've been
at Atlantic for so long,

404
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:19,540
I just want to give
those guys a chance, you know,
to at least match the offer.

405
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:21,834
Mm-hmm.
Oh, certainly, certainly.

406
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,418
But, uh, I doubt
they'll be able to.

407
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:25,546
We're giving you
a state-of-the-art deal here.

408
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:28,966
Well, you know, since I'm
producing my own records,
I was wondering if I could

409
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:30,843
uh, own my masters, too.

410
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:39,434
Well,

411
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:41,728
Ray, we've... we've never
done that before.

412
00:17:41,854 --> 00:17:43,856
No record company has.

413
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:48,694
Well, I think I'm going to
have to have it that way for
me to leave Atlantic Records.

414
00:17:57,536 --> 00:17:59,872
Ahmet believes
we're family here at Atlantic.

415
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:01,999
I believe we're family
here at Atlantic.

416
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,876
Obviously, you don't!

417
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:05,961
Ahmet wouldn't believe it.

418
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:07,588
You know what he said, Ray?

419
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:09,590
He said you would never
turn your back on us.

420
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:11,842
Never for a schlockmeister
like Sam Clark!

421
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:15,012
That's rich.
Sam Clark's a corporate slug,

422
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:18,307
who wouldn't know
the difference between
Earl Hines and Art Tatum!

423
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:26,648
We let you grow here, Ray.

424
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:30,652
And nobody's taking
credit for your talent,
but we nourished it.

425
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:33,155
We let you do your thing.

426
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,909
God damn it!
We deserve better than this.

427
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,036
You know what,
don't think that
I don't appreciate

428
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:40,913
everything you guys
have done here, Jerry.

429
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:43,624
Ahmet, I'm very
proud of the work that
we've done here together.

430
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:46,919
But, Atlantic has done
pretty good money-wise
on my records, haven't they?

431
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,378
Yes, we've done
very well, Ray.

432
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:51,673
You... you were the ones that
taught me that making a record
is business,

433
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:54,176
and find the best
business deal you can.

434
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:57,513
Now, 75 cents of every dollar,
and owning my own masters

435
00:18:57,596 --> 00:18:59,681
is a pretty damn
good deal.

436
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:01,892
Can you match it?

437
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:06,939
Ray, we would love to
match it, but we just can't.

438
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:11,068
That's a better deal
than Sinatra gets.

439
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:15,489
I'm very proud of you.

440
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:21,537
Looks like those boys
are going to get
a taste of country dumb.

441
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:22,830
Yeah.

442
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,084
He'll be all right, man.

443
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:30,128
You guys
always do find the best.

444
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:48,939
# Georgia #

445
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:53,402
# Georgia #

446
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:57,990
# The whole day through #

447
00:19:58,115 --> 00:20:00,951
# The whole day through #

448
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:03,162
# Just an old sweet song #

449
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:09,418
# Keeps Georgia on my mind #

450
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:14,173
# Georgia on my mind #

451
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,593
# I said Georgia #

452
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,557
# Georgia #

453
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:25,434
Listen to that crap.

454
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:30,022
Thought you said that
ABC wasn't going to
force nothing on him.

455
00:20:30,189 --> 00:20:31,648
They didn't.

456
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:34,026
It was Ray's idea.

457
00:20:36,195 --> 00:20:37,196
Something new.

458
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:39,865
What are we then, Jeff?
Something old?

459
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:43,619
Yeah, what about us?
We got to eat, too.

460
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:52,628
# Other arms should
reach out to me #

461
00:20:55,047 --> 00:21:00,052
# Other eyes smile tenderly #

462
00:21:02,221 --> 00:21:07,226
# Still in the peaceful dreams
I see #

463
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:12,648
# The road leads back
to you #

464
00:21:20,656 --> 00:21:21,657
It's a hit record.

465
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:23,367
What the hell
is wrong with that?

466
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:25,953
Critics say you've gone
middle-of-the-road.

467
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:29,122
The orchestra, the choir,
The Perry Como Show, man?

468
00:21:29,248 --> 00:21:32,709
If I feel the music,
that means it's real.

469
00:21:32,835 --> 00:21:35,504
No, it ain't.
Ray Charles is a sellout.

470
00:21:35,546 --> 00:21:38,549
The blind Liberace,
leaving those Rocking
Chair roots behind.

471
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:39,633
Quincy Jones.

472
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:41,552
Can we get a picture
of these two guys?

473
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:43,512
Six-nine!
Hey, boy.

474
00:21:43,554 --> 00:21:45,973
Look, here, uh,
this interview is over.

475
00:21:46,098 --> 00:21:47,933
I'd love to
get you two together, man.

476
00:21:47,975 --> 00:21:49,393
S-some other time.

477
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:52,396
Look at you.
How's it going, man?
You look good.

478
00:21:52,396 --> 00:21:54,523
Let me look at you.
You look good, too.

479
00:21:54,565 --> 00:21:56,233
You hear what they're
saying about me?

480
00:21:56,275 --> 00:21:59,403
I just said that I... I
can't do it no more.
I've gone middle-of-the-road.

481
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:00,946
So crank out
another hit.

482
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:02,114
Let me tell you something,

483
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:04,575
it ain't easy
to keep on being greezy, kid.

484
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:06,535
Where you blow in from?

485
00:22:07,703 --> 00:22:08,745
Paris.

486
00:22:08,871 --> 00:22:09,997
Bonjour.

487
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:12,249
Yeah, man.
France is where it's at.

488
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:14,543
Yeah, man. And all that stuff
you've been playing,

489
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:17,004
man, it's just...
it really feels out of sight.

490
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:19,590
You know, we gotta
record something together.

491
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,425
I mean, people will
really dig it.

492
00:22:21,425 --> 00:22:23,302
So, where you going
after the Festival?

493
00:22:23,427 --> 00:22:27,181
Oh, I... I go to D.C., Richmond,
uh, Virginia, Georgia.

494
00:22:27,306 --> 00:22:30,142
You know what, once you
get the record out there,
you gotta sell it.

495
00:22:30,184 --> 00:22:31,602
The South, man?

496
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:34,146
I'm not doing that no more.

497
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:37,024
Hey, come on, kid,
that's where
the money is, baby.

498
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:39,610
You know, When I left Seattle
with Hamp,

499
00:22:39,735 --> 00:22:40,903
we went down there, man.

500
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:43,614
And it felt like
I walked into a prison cell.

501
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:47,326
You know, a black man
is a "boy" in Mississippi, Ray.

502
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:49,328
Even if he's 80 years old.

503
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:55,000
I'm never playing
to Jim Crow again. Ever.

504
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:56,919
If that's what you feel, baby.

505
00:22:57,002 --> 00:23:00,631
I'm serious, Ray.
Man, we gotta do something.

506
00:23:02,341 --> 00:23:04,218
Well, you know,
what... what the hell, man.

507
00:23:04,343 --> 00:23:07,638
You're just going
to leave a lot more money
on the table for me.

508
00:23:08,222 --> 00:23:09,890
You're welcome to it,
man.

509
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,532
You ready to work?

510
00:23:26,657 --> 00:23:27,950
Work on what?

511
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:31,036
Get over here, you gotta
help me with this.

512
00:23:31,078 --> 00:23:32,538
Percy just sent me
some new music.

513
00:23:46,552 --> 00:23:48,846
You know what
they're saying about me?

514
00:23:48,846 --> 00:23:51,348
Said I've lost something,
said I've gone
middle-of-the-road.

515
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:53,684
They may as well say
the same thing about you.

516
00:23:53,684 --> 00:23:55,060
You were the soul
of this band.

517
00:23:55,102 --> 00:23:57,563
Now every time you're around,
you're just drunk.

518
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:01,108
Drunk soul
of a blind junkie.

519
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:02,860
What a lovely couple.

520
00:24:02,985 --> 00:24:05,404
Why don't you
just get out of here?

521
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:09,158
I ain't drunk, Ray.

522
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:11,451
I'm pregnant.

523
00:24:12,661 --> 00:24:15,414
Yeah, that's right.
I'm having your baby.

524
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:18,292
You ain't really...
You... you can't do that.

525
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:20,419
I'm gonna have to
talk to the doctor.

526
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,670
You gotta get rid of it.

527
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:24,882
My God!

528
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:27,176
What, because
I'm not your precious Bea?

529
00:24:27,718 --> 00:24:29,970
I'm not good enough
to have this baby?

530
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,724
You lay up
in my bed every night.

531
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:35,017
My bed!

532
00:24:36,185 --> 00:24:37,853
I'm gonna have this baby, Ray.

533
00:24:41,023 --> 00:24:43,442
No, Ray! No!
Come on, come on.
Come on, just listen.

534
00:24:43,442 --> 00:24:44,443
Just listen to me.

535
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:45,903
You know
I care about you, baby.

536
00:24:45,903 --> 00:24:48,280
I won't let
nothing happen to you.
I'll pay for everything.

537
00:24:48,322 --> 00:24:49,406
No!

538
00:24:49,448 --> 00:24:51,617
It's gonna cost you
more than money.

539
00:24:51,742 --> 00:24:54,745
I want you to leave her, Ray.
Come and be with our baby.

540
00:24:54,745 --> 00:24:58,290
You out of your damn mind.
You knew the rules
when you got into this.

541
00:24:58,332 --> 00:25:00,751
You know goddamn well
I ain't gonna
leave my family.

542
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:03,754
Leave your family?

543
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:06,632
You are a damn fool,
you know that?

544
00:25:07,382 --> 00:25:10,761
Between the dope
and the music and me,

545
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:13,472
you already done left
your damn family!

546
00:25:13,931 --> 00:25:17,893
You know what
the sad part about it is,
Ray, you don't even know it.

547
00:25:22,773 --> 00:25:24,233
You know what?

548
00:25:24,358 --> 00:25:27,903
From now on, it's strictly
business between you and me.

549
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:33,659
Yeah, that's it. That's it.
Keep that anger.

550
00:25:34,368 --> 00:25:36,036
# Hit the road, Jack #

551
00:25:36,078 --> 00:25:37,663
# And don't you come back
no more #

552
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:39,832
# no more,
no more, no more #

553
00:25:39,957 --> 00:25:41,124
# Hit the road, Jack #

554
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,252
# and don't you come back
no more #

555
00:25:43,377 --> 00:25:46,088
# You ain't right,
hit the road Jack #

556
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:47,965
# Don't you come back
no more #

557
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:50,259
# no more,
no more, no more #

558
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:51,510
# Hit the road, Jack #

559
00:25:51,552 --> 00:25:53,637
# and don't come back
no more #

560
00:25:54,221 --> 00:25:55,639
# What you sayin'? #

561
00:25:55,681 --> 00:25:56,807
# Hit the road Jack #

562
00:25:56,849 --> 00:25:58,559
# And don't come back
no more #

563
00:25:58,642 --> 00:26:00,853
# no more,
no more, no more #

564
00:26:00,936 --> 00:26:02,229
# Hit the road Jack #

565
00:26:02,271 --> 00:26:04,690
# And don't you come back
no more #

566
00:26:05,858 --> 00:26:07,818
# Now baby, listen baby #

567
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,403
# don't-a treat me
this-a way #

568
00:26:09,528 --> 00:26:11,864
# For I'll be back
on my feet some day #

569
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:14,533
# Don't care if you do
'cause it's understood #

570
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:17,536
# You ain't got no money,
you just ain't no good #

571
00:26:17,578 --> 00:26:19,705
# Well, I guess
if you say so #

572
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:22,457
# I'd have to pack my things
and go #

573
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:23,584
# That's right #

574
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:24,668
# Hit the road, Jack #

575
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,295
# And don't you come back
no more #

576
00:26:26,378 --> 00:26:28,547
# no more,
no more, no more #

577
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:30,174
# Hit the road Jack #

578
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:32,593
# And don't you come back
no more #

579
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:34,178
# What you sayin'? #

580
00:26:34,178 --> 00:26:35,888
Hey, Ray, it's Sam.

581
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:38,765
Can you hear me? It's Sam!

582
00:26:38,891 --> 00:26:41,560
Yeah, hey, Hit the Road
is our second number one.

583
00:26:41,602 --> 00:26:44,771
Yeah. ABC is taking out ads
in all the trades.

584
00:26:45,189 --> 00:26:47,691
Yeah, oh, and congrats
on your Grammy nomination.

585
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:50,861
No, no, no I know
you're going to win.

586
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:53,197
Hey, you feeling all right?

587
00:26:53,739 --> 00:26:56,325
Well, come on, baby,
be happy.
You're doing good.

588
00:26:56,575 --> 00:26:57,618
Thank you, Sam.

589
00:26:58,869 --> 00:27:00,621
I really am happy about that.

590
00:27:01,205 --> 00:27:02,706
Yeah.

591
00:27:06,293 --> 00:27:09,713
I'll stop by Jeff's room
and get my money
on my way out.

592
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:17,638
Ray.

593
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:21,308
Margie, you ain't gotta leave,
baby.

594
00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:23,477
I'm on your hit record.

595
00:27:23,602 --> 00:27:26,396
If I'm ever going to go solo,
then now's the time.

596
00:27:26,522 --> 00:27:28,315
Yeah, I... I don't want you...

597
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:30,234
I don't want you to go solo.

598
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:32,778
Ray, for once,
I'm doing something for me.

599
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,240
You remember the hummingbird,
right?

600
00:27:37,074 --> 00:27:38,075
What?

601
00:27:38,784 --> 00:27:40,536
The hummingbird, Bea.

602
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:55,551
And I don't want you to go.

603
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:10,357
Somebody will fetch you

604
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:11,942
when your bus
gets to St. Augustine.

605
00:28:11,984 --> 00:28:14,111
And when you get there,
show them this sign,

606
00:28:14,236 --> 00:28:16,572
and tell them you're name is
Ray Charles Robinson.

607
00:28:17,531 --> 00:28:20,450
And them sandwiches I made,
don't eat 'em all at once.
You hear?

608
00:28:20,534 --> 00:28:22,744
Oh, please,
don't make me go away.

609
00:28:22,828 --> 00:28:24,413
I'll keep up
with the normal kids.

610
00:28:24,538 --> 00:28:26,540
I'll be good,
just like George.

611
00:28:26,582 --> 00:28:28,584
This ain't got nothing
to do with George.

612
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:31,128
I've taken you
as far as I can, baby.

613
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:34,464
Them teachers
at that blind school, they can
teach you things I can't.

614
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,300
And you need an education
in this world.

615
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:37,593
I don't want
no education!

616
00:28:37,676 --> 00:28:38,594
Don't say that!

617
00:28:38,719 --> 00:28:40,679
I don't!
I want to stay with you!

618
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:41,722
Stop it, Ray!

619
00:28:41,847 --> 00:28:44,433
I won't have you living
hand-to-mouth like me,
you hear?

620
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:48,770
Now listen, if you
want to do something
to make your mama proud,

621
00:28:49,021 --> 00:28:52,858
promise me, promise me
you'll never let nobody
turn you into no cripple.

622
00:28:52,983 --> 00:28:54,610
You won't become
no charity case.

623
00:28:54,735 --> 00:28:56,653
You'll stand on
your own two feet.

624
00:28:56,737 --> 00:28:58,030
I promise.

625
00:28:58,405 --> 00:28:59,907
I love you, baby.

626
00:29:00,908 --> 00:29:02,409
I'm so proud of you.

627
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:18,509
No more segregation!

628
00:29:18,592 --> 00:29:21,637
No more segregation!
No more segregation!

629
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:24,765
No more segregation!
No more segregation!

630
00:29:28,727 --> 00:29:31,522
No more segregation!
No more segregation!

631
00:29:31,605 --> 00:29:34,650
No more segregation!
No more segregation!

632
00:29:34,733 --> 00:29:37,694
No more segregation!
No more segregation!

633
00:29:37,778 --> 00:29:39,530
Welcome back to Augusta, Ray!

634
00:29:39,655 --> 00:29:41,365
Hey, good to see you.

635
00:29:41,657 --> 00:29:44,618
No more segregation!
No more segregation!

636
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,495
Do you believe
in the protest, Ray?

637
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:48,205
Get out of here!

638
00:29:48,247 --> 00:29:50,833
Ray, I'm sorry about this.
Hurry on up inside.

639
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:52,668
We got refreshments
waiting.

640
00:29:52,709 --> 00:29:54,378
Mr. Charles!
Mr. Charles!

641
00:29:54,378 --> 00:29:56,129
You know tonight's show
is segregated?

642
00:29:56,255 --> 00:29:57,840
The dance floor
is whites only.

643
00:29:57,923 --> 00:29:59,383
Negroes can't leave
the balcony.

644
00:29:59,383 --> 00:30:01,552
That's how it is, man.
You know, this is Georgia.

645
00:30:01,552 --> 00:30:02,928
You think we don't know that?

646
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:05,347
Negroes are persecuted
in this state every day!

647
00:30:05,389 --> 00:30:07,349
Ain't nothing
I can do about that.

648
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:10,519
I'm an entertainer.
And... and we all gotta
play Jim Crow down here.

649
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:12,354
I'm sorry, man.
Now get out of here, boy.

650
00:30:12,396 --> 00:30:13,689
It doesn't have to
be that way.

651
00:30:13,814 --> 00:30:16,066
You could change things,
right here and now!

652
00:30:16,108 --> 00:30:17,734
I'm sorry, son.
Ain't nothing I can do.

653
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,862
You hear that, boy?
That's the way things are.

654
00:30:19,945 --> 00:30:21,572
Ain't nothing
or nobody can change it.

655
00:30:21,655 --> 00:30:24,449
Now get your black ass
out of here, and take
that trash with you!

656
00:30:24,575 --> 00:30:27,870
Hold on... hold on.
He... he's right.
He's right, Jeff.

657
00:30:27,953 --> 00:30:28,996
Get them on the bus.

658
00:30:29,037 --> 00:30:29,997
You sure?

659
00:30:30,122 --> 00:30:31,373
Get them back on the bus!

660
00:30:31,415 --> 00:30:33,041
Y'all heard him!
Y'all heard Ray!

661
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:34,877
Back on the bus!

662
00:30:35,711 --> 00:30:36,712
Are you serious?

663
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:39,131
Get them on the bus.

664
00:30:39,173 --> 00:30:40,674
I can't do nothing here.

665
00:30:40,716 --> 00:30:42,009
Ray, you know me.

666
00:30:42,134 --> 00:30:45,429
I'm not gonna lose money
just because you suddenly
got religion.

667
00:30:45,554 --> 00:30:46,722
Ain't nothing I can do, man.

668
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:49,183
We have a contract with me.
You break it,
I'll sue your ass!

669
00:30:49,308 --> 00:30:51,351
I'll win, Ray!
You gotta do
what you gotta do.

670
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:52,436
Look, I'll win big!

671
00:30:52,436 --> 00:30:53,604
Do what you gotta do.

672
00:30:53,604 --> 00:30:55,439
I told you,
I'll own your ass, Ray!

673
00:30:57,191 --> 00:30:58,400
Thank you, Mr. Charles.

674
00:30:58,442 --> 00:30:59,776
You could be the first.

675
00:30:59,902 --> 00:31:01,486
No, thank you, son.
You were right.

676
00:31:01,612 --> 00:31:03,071
You're right.

677
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,867
You'll never
work Georgia again!

678
00:31:08,494 --> 00:31:11,914
He filed a lawsuit and
it's more than a fine, Ray.

679
00:31:12,498 --> 00:31:15,792
This guy's got juice.
He can get you barred from
ever playing Georgia again.

680
00:31:16,627 --> 00:31:20,005
But he's willing to drop
the suit if you'll
make up the gig.

681
00:31:20,506 --> 00:31:22,466
Not if it's segregated.

682
00:31:22,674 --> 00:31:23,717
Ray,

683
00:31:25,344 --> 00:31:28,347
I admire
what you're doing, man,
but you can't afford this.

684
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,057
Georgia is
our highest-grossing state.

685
00:31:30,182 --> 00:31:33,894
I'm not playing any more
to Jim Crow joints ever again,
did you got that?

686
00:31:34,186 --> 00:31:35,771
Yeah. I got it.

687
00:31:36,355 --> 00:31:38,398
Jeff, get those people in here
so we can rehearse.

688
00:31:38,524 --> 00:31:39,942
Com on, y'all, let's go.

689
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:46,615
# Unchain my heart #

690
00:31:46,657 --> 00:31:48,116
# Unchain my heart #

691
00:31:48,242 --> 00:31:49,451
# Baby, let me be #

692
00:31:49,535 --> 00:31:50,953
# Unchain my heart #

693
00:31:51,036 --> 00:31:52,704
# Unchain my heart #

694
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:53,956
# Unchain my heart #

695
00:31:53,997 --> 00:31:55,833
# 'Cause you don't
care about me #

696
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:57,668
# Unchain my heart #

697
00:31:58,669 --> 00:32:01,255
# Why lead me
through a life of misery #

698
00:32:01,338 --> 00:32:04,091
# When you don't care
a bag of beans for me #

699
00:32:04,216 --> 00:32:08,720
# So unchain my heart
oh please,
please set me free #

700
00:32:11,682 --> 00:32:13,016
Now, go ahead and dance!

701
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,936
Let's dance, everybody!

702
00:32:15,978 --> 00:32:17,145
Come on!

703
00:32:18,146 --> 00:32:19,690
Let's dance now!

704
00:32:25,112 --> 00:32:26,280
Charles, you okay?

705
00:32:26,363 --> 00:32:27,364
Yeah. What's going on?

706
00:32:27,406 --> 00:32:28,699
Just kids onstage dancing.

707
00:32:28,824 --> 00:32:30,868
Well, let them dance.
That's what they're here for.

708
00:32:30,951 --> 00:32:33,162
Please don't hurt them!
Just keep dancing!

709
00:32:33,245 --> 00:32:34,580
Keep going!
Keep going!

710
00:32:34,997 --> 00:32:36,874
# I'm under your spell #

711
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:40,669
# Like a man in a trance #

712
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,422
# But I know darn well #

713
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:47,092
# That I don't
stand a chance #

714
00:32:47,718 --> 00:32:49,553
# So unchain my heart #

715
00:32:49,595 --> 00:32:51,138
# Unchain my heart #

716
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,973
# Let me go my way #

717
00:32:53,015 --> 00:32:54,266
# Unchain my heart #

718
00:32:54,308 --> 00:32:56,268
# Unchain my heart #

719
00:32:57,436 --> 00:32:59,396
# You worry me
night and day #

720
00:32:59,438 --> 00:33:01,190
# Unchain my heart #

721
00:33:01,732 --> 00:33:04,443
# Why lead me
through a life of misery #

722
00:33:04,902 --> 00:33:07,613
# When you don't care
a bag of beans for me #

723
00:33:07,738 --> 00:33:11,200
# So unchain my heart,
oh please,
please set me free #

724
00:33:11,325 --> 00:33:12,493
# Please set me free #

725
00:33:13,327 --> 00:33:14,745
# Oh won't you
set me free #

726
00:33:14,745 --> 00:33:16,163
# Please set me free #

727
00:33:16,205 --> 00:33:17,915
# Whoa, set me free #

728
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,333
# Please set me free #

729
00:33:20,626 --> 00:33:22,294
Mr. Charles,
it's Western Union!

730
00:33:22,336 --> 00:33:23,921
We have a telegram
for you.

731
00:33:24,505 --> 00:33:25,923
You have to sign
for it, sir.

732
00:33:25,923 --> 00:33:27,007
I'm coming.

733
00:33:31,762 --> 00:33:34,765
Indianapolis police.
Got a report of loud music
coming from here.

734
00:33:34,806 --> 00:33:36,934
Where do you think
you're going, pal?

735
00:33:38,227 --> 00:33:39,770
I'm just going
to the bathroom.

736
00:33:39,895 --> 00:33:41,605
Handcuff
this son of a bitch.

737
00:33:42,314 --> 00:33:45,317
Recognize this, Ray?
Heroin's a felony.

738
00:33:45,776 --> 00:33:47,820
It ain't like
I'm dealing it, man.

739
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,321
I'm not hurting nobody.

740
00:33:49,363 --> 00:33:51,323
Oh, no, you're
hurting everybody.

741
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:54,409
Your jungle music is
poisoning our kids' minds.

742
00:33:54,493 --> 00:33:56,662
Hey, I'm gonna put
your black ass away forever.

743
00:33:56,703 --> 00:34:00,123
You have to understand.
I got... I got a wife,
I got kids.

744
00:34:00,207 --> 00:34:01,375
I got responsibilities.

745
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:03,418
Why don't you tell that story
to these people.

746
00:34:03,544 --> 00:34:04,962
Bring them in!

747
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,675
Ray! Was it a setup, Ray?

748
00:34:09,758 --> 00:34:11,635
How long you
been on heroin?

749
00:34:11,677 --> 00:34:13,011
Come on, Ray.

750
00:34:13,095 --> 00:34:15,097
What did they
charge you with?

751
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:26,149
# You give your hand to me #

752
00:34:27,985 --> 00:34:31,155
# And then you say, hello #

753
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:35,450
# And I can hardly speak #

754
00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:40,289
# My heart is beating so #

755
00:34:40,956 --> 00:34:43,834
# And anyone can tell #

756
00:34:45,169 --> 00:34:48,547
# You think you know me well #

757
00:34:50,424 --> 00:34:54,428
# But you,
you don't know me at all #

758
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:56,722
Hi, baby.

759
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:58,056
David.

760
00:34:58,182 --> 00:34:59,600
Uh, uh, Bea, he can stay.

761
00:34:59,725 --> 00:35:01,310
No. Baby, come on.

762
00:35:01,727 --> 00:35:03,020
Bea?
What?

763
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:05,981
You know, since I got back...

764
00:35:06,023 --> 00:35:07,649
Since you got out.

765
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,067
Yeah.

766
00:35:09,484 --> 00:35:13,030
Well, since I got here,
you haven't said more than
two words to me.

767
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,282
Ray, what am I
supposed to say?

768
00:35:15,616 --> 00:35:18,202
My words don't seem to
mean much to you anymore.

769
00:35:18,202 --> 00:35:19,661
Maybe they never did.

770
00:35:19,745 --> 00:35:21,997
Come on, Bea,
you... you know I love you.

771
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:23,749
Are you gonna stop then?

772
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:27,878
You know what, Bea, what you
don't understand is

773
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,214
there's a lot of
mean-spirited people
out there.

774
00:35:31,465 --> 00:35:32,466
Yeah.

775
00:35:37,513 --> 00:35:38,597
Ray?

776
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:45,062
You know, I had to
bring Junior home
from school today

777
00:35:45,062 --> 00:35:46,939
'cause of what
the other kids were sayin'.

778
00:35:47,022 --> 00:35:48,482
They got mean-ass kids
around here.

779
00:35:48,524 --> 00:35:50,484
I think we should move
to Beverly Hills.

780
00:35:50,526 --> 00:35:52,069
No, no, Ray,
we're not gonna move.

781
00:35:52,152 --> 00:35:54,071
'Cause it... it's not
about where we live, Ray.

782
00:35:54,196 --> 00:35:56,532
It's about what you're doing
to yourself.

783
00:35:56,824 --> 00:35:58,408
And those boys worship you.

784
00:35:58,534 --> 00:36:00,953
You want them to end up
using that poison, too?

785
00:36:00,953 --> 00:36:02,663
Bea, that's not fair.

786
00:36:02,746 --> 00:36:05,374
What's not fair?
What's not fair, Ray?

787
00:36:05,415 --> 00:36:07,626
That... that's a low blow.

788
00:36:10,003 --> 00:36:11,004
Hello?

789
00:36:12,506 --> 00:36:15,759
Don't jive me, Milt.
Don't jive me, man!

790
00:36:15,843 --> 00:36:16,969
Really?

791
00:36:17,261 --> 00:36:20,931
Ah, good, good, good.
Tell... tell Sam
I said thank you.

792
00:36:20,973 --> 00:36:22,975
All right.
All right, then.

793
00:36:24,518 --> 00:36:25,561
Oh, yeah!

794
00:36:25,644 --> 00:36:28,355
What, Ray?
What? Come on, now.

795
00:36:28,397 --> 00:36:30,274
Ray, tell me what happened.

796
00:36:30,274 --> 00:36:32,526
ABC got the case dropped.

797
00:36:32,568 --> 00:36:34,403
The police
didn't have a warrant.

798
00:36:34,444 --> 00:36:35,571
They bought them off.

799
00:36:35,696 --> 00:36:37,656
Damn it, Bea, do you
want me to go to prison?

800
00:36:37,698 --> 00:36:40,159
No. Ray, I want you
to stop lying to yourself,

801
00:36:40,284 --> 00:36:42,327
and they are making that
completely impossible.

802
00:36:42,411 --> 00:36:43,954
You know what,
you don't understand.

803
00:36:43,996 --> 00:36:45,706
Then make me understand,
Ray!

804
00:36:45,831 --> 00:36:49,168
Baby, when I walk out
that door, I walk out alone
in the dark!

805
00:36:49,251 --> 00:36:50,669
I'm trying to
do something

806
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:53,422
that ain't nobody ever done
in music and business.

807
00:36:53,463 --> 00:36:56,133
But I can't do it
if I'm alone
everywhere I go.

808
00:36:56,717 --> 00:36:59,052
I don't want to
be alone here, Bea.

809
00:36:59,178 --> 00:37:00,888
Not in my own home.

810
00:37:04,558 --> 00:37:07,186
Look, Bea,
if you don't understand me,

811
00:37:08,061 --> 00:37:09,605
then who will?

812
00:37:16,195 --> 00:37:17,738
I don't know, Ray.

813
00:37:21,325 --> 00:37:23,660
David? I'm coming!

814
00:37:24,786 --> 00:37:26,288
Mama's coming!

815
00:37:30,042 --> 00:37:34,046
Ray, we pull you
out of the fire,
and you want country music?

816
00:37:34,046 --> 00:37:37,174
Look here, I've been singing
country music all my life.

817
00:37:37,216 --> 00:37:39,760
As a matter of fact,
I used to play with
the Florida Playboys.

818
00:37:39,801 --> 00:37:41,345
We made a big
investment in you

819
00:37:41,345 --> 00:37:42,888
and it's paying off
handsomely.

820
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,640
For both of us,
I might add.

821
00:37:44,681 --> 00:37:46,225
We don't want to
lose your fan base.

822
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:48,352
Yeah, you know,
you got a point there,

823
00:37:48,477 --> 00:37:51,939
but I actually think that
we have more to gain
than we do to lose.

824
00:37:52,898 --> 00:37:55,526
Ray, it's a bad idea.

825
00:37:57,528 --> 00:38:00,030
When I came to ABC, you guys
put in the contract

826
00:38:00,072 --> 00:38:02,115
that I can choose
my own music.

827
00:38:02,991 --> 00:38:04,701
You want to read
that paragraph?

828
00:38:08,956 --> 00:38:10,666
It's on page three.

829
00:38:12,042 --> 00:38:13,544
I don't need to see it.

830
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:25,222
Good evening, Saint Louis.

831
00:38:25,264 --> 00:38:27,641
It's time
for the main attraction.

832
00:38:27,683 --> 00:38:31,270
The innovator of soul.
The genius himself.

833
00:38:31,562 --> 00:38:33,397
Ray Charles!

834
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:54,001
Go on, go on, Ray!

835
00:38:59,173 --> 00:39:00,424
Thank you so much.

836
00:39:00,465 --> 00:39:03,677
You know what,
I know that a lot of y'all
don't know that

837
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:06,889
I... I was brought up
in the South.

838
00:39:06,972 --> 00:39:10,100
You know, every time
you turn on the radio there
in the South,

839
00:39:10,184 --> 00:39:11,560
you hear the Grand Ole Opry.

840
00:39:11,602 --> 00:39:14,730
That's what I grew up singing,
so I hope you don't mind,

841
00:39:15,355 --> 00:39:18,901
I... I want to sing something
to give you a taste
of my country roots.

842
00:39:20,152 --> 00:39:21,445
Unchain My Heart!

843
00:39:21,612 --> 00:39:23,197
Georgia on My Mind, Ray!

844
00:39:25,491 --> 00:39:27,743
# I can't stop loving you #

845
00:39:28,327 --> 00:39:31,413
Turn 'em, the lights up top
and on the mezzanine,

846
00:39:31,788 --> 00:39:35,083
let's take everything down
and hit Ray
with a follow spot.

847
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:36,668
We're doing it,
on it on my count.

848
00:39:37,044 --> 00:39:39,046
# To live in memory #

849
00:39:39,922 --> 00:39:42,132
IN 5, 4...

850
00:39:42,591 --> 00:39:45,761
# of the lonesome times #

851
00:39:46,887 --> 00:39:49,932
# Yeah #

852
00:39:49,973 --> 00:39:54,520
# I can't stop wanting you #

853
00:39:56,647 --> 00:40:00,526
# It's useless to say #

854
00:40:03,654 --> 00:40:07,366
# So I'll just live my life #

855
00:40:07,491 --> 00:40:09,785
# I'll live my life #

856
00:40:10,244 --> 00:40:13,539
# in dreams of yesterday #

857
00:40:17,209 --> 00:40:21,088
# Those happy hours #

858
00:40:21,129 --> 00:40:24,675
# Those happy hours #

859
00:40:24,967 --> 00:40:28,428
# that we once knew #

860
00:40:29,805 --> 00:40:30,973
Cab's here.

861
00:40:31,014 --> 00:40:32,099
Okay.

862
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:36,562
Dad, if you can't see,
how can you choose
the right color socks?

863
00:40:36,645 --> 00:40:38,564
I'm... I'm gonna show you,
all right?

864
00:40:38,647 --> 00:40:39,857
Let me show you something.

865
00:40:39,982 --> 00:40:41,859
See? Right here?

866
00:40:42,234 --> 00:40:45,237
The two, right there,
I got it sewn in thick,
so I can feel it.

867
00:40:45,404 --> 00:40:46,989
So, it means two is brown.

868
00:40:47,114 --> 00:40:49,408
One is black. Three is blue.

869
00:40:49,533 --> 00:40:51,285
And... and... and where's four?

870
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:52,452
Nowhere.

871
00:40:52,578 --> 00:40:54,997
Four ain't nowhere.
There ain't no four.
You're right.

872
00:40:57,291 --> 00:41:00,294
# Heals a broken heart #

873
00:41:00,419 --> 00:41:03,297
# But time has stood still #

874
00:41:03,422 --> 00:41:06,091
# Time has stood still #

875
00:41:06,175 --> 00:41:09,553
# Since we've been apart #

876
00:41:09,595 --> 00:41:12,431
# Since we've been apart #

877
00:41:30,616 --> 00:41:32,201
Still working on the balcony.

878
00:41:32,284 --> 00:41:34,036
Okay, guys, we got
10 minutes to load out!

879
00:41:34,077 --> 00:41:35,621
Change back at the hotel.

880
00:41:35,704 --> 00:41:37,748
They bought that
country jive hook,
line and sinker.

881
00:41:37,789 --> 00:41:39,041
Ray, man,
you're amazing.

882
00:41:39,082 --> 00:41:42,211
I'm gonna tell you something.
Country music.
You know why they like it?

883
00:41:42,294 --> 00:41:44,379
The stories, man.
They got great stories.

884
00:41:44,505 --> 00:41:45,589
Hey, Joe.

885
00:41:45,631 --> 00:41:49,009
Ray, I want to introduce you
to Joe Adams.
Hal Ziegler hired Joe

886
00:41:49,051 --> 00:41:51,470
as the announcer
for the rest of the tour.

887
00:41:51,512 --> 00:41:54,056
I know you,
Mayor of Melody.

888
00:41:54,097 --> 00:41:56,600
I used to listen to your
radio show in I.A.
In the '50s.

889
00:41:56,642 --> 00:41:59,228
We've both come
a ways since then.

890
00:41:59,311 --> 00:42:01,939
What was that counting
you were doing back there?

891
00:42:02,022 --> 00:42:04,608
I was cueing down the lights.
That shuts up the audience

892
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:07,236
so you can sing your ballad
instead of
having to scream it.

893
00:42:07,361 --> 00:42:09,655
Hey, well, I'll be damned.
Who told you to do that?

894
00:42:09,738 --> 00:42:11,406
No one.
It just needed to be done.

895
00:42:11,532 --> 00:42:13,367
See, that's what
I'm talking about.

896
00:42:13,492 --> 00:42:16,370
I like to hear a person say
"It needed to be done"

897
00:42:16,411 --> 00:42:19,122
as opposed to
a person saying,
"It ain't my job."

898
00:42:19,665 --> 00:42:21,542
You know,
tell me about Central Avenue.

899
00:42:22,084 --> 00:42:22,960
I know you know
Jack Lauderdale.

900
00:42:24,086 --> 00:42:25,546
Hello, New York!

901
00:42:25,629 --> 00:42:26,964
Hello, Boston!

902
00:42:27,214 --> 00:42:28,549
Hello, Saint Louis!

903
00:42:28,632 --> 00:42:30,384
Good evening, San Francisco!

904
00:42:32,135 --> 00:42:33,971
# Bye bye love #

905
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:36,849
# Bye bye happiness #

906
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:39,434
Ray, I got
some good news for you.

907
00:42:39,518 --> 00:42:41,103
We got the cover of Cash Box.

908
00:42:41,144 --> 00:42:44,398
"The nation's hottest album:
Modern Sounds of
Country & Western."

909
00:42:44,523 --> 00:42:45,566
You are hotter
than hell.

910
00:42:45,649 --> 00:42:46,567
That's what they say.

911
00:42:46,692 --> 00:42:49,111
I've been watchin',
your albums are
going through the roof,

912
00:42:49,153 --> 00:42:50,863
your concerts are
always selling out.

913
00:42:50,988 --> 00:42:52,531
You'll need shelters
for your money.

914
00:42:52,573 --> 00:42:54,158
You're in a
new tax bracket.

915
00:42:54,158 --> 00:42:56,994
Keep your drawers on, Fathead!
I got the instruments!

916
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,580
Jeff, Joe was in
the film Carmen Jones.

917
00:42:59,663 --> 00:43:01,165
Who was
the director again?

918
00:43:01,248 --> 00:43:02,291
Otto Preminger.

919
00:43:02,374 --> 00:43:05,460
He was also on Broadway
with Lena Horne.

920
00:43:05,586 --> 00:43:08,005
She was the star.
I was supporting.

921
00:43:08,172 --> 00:43:09,798
Is that a fact?

922
00:43:09,965 --> 00:43:13,177
Prepare for an extraordinary
evening of music.

923
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,179
Perhaps the most innovative,
unique

924
00:43:15,304 --> 00:43:17,181
and energetic
musical voice today.

925
00:43:17,264 --> 00:43:18,557
Please welcome
to the stage...

926
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:19,892
It is my distinct pleasure...

927
00:43:19,975 --> 00:43:22,269
Please give
your warmest welcome,
the one-of-a-kind...

928
00:43:22,311 --> 00:43:23,729
I present Mr. Ray...

929
00:43:23,854 --> 00:43:25,731
Ray... Ray Charles!

930
00:43:27,566 --> 00:43:29,318
# Bye bye love #

931
00:43:30,694 --> 00:43:32,571
# Bye bye sweet caress #

932
00:43:33,322 --> 00:43:35,073
# Hello emptiness #

933
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:37,034
# I think I'm gonna die #

934
00:43:40,454 --> 00:43:42,122
# Bye bye love #

935
00:43:48,045 --> 00:43:49,505
# I think I'm gonna die #

936
00:43:53,091 --> 00:43:54,760
# I think I'm gonna die #

937
00:43:54,927 --> 00:43:56,386
...Ray Charles!

938
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:59,806
# I think I'm gonna die #

939
00:44:00,891 --> 00:44:02,518
# I think I'm gonna die #

940
00:44:03,352 --> 00:44:05,521
Bea, there's a park right
at the end of the street.

941
00:44:05,604 --> 00:44:07,898
You can see the whole I.A.
Basin from there.

942
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:10,067
Not even Beverly Hills
has views like that.

943
00:44:10,192 --> 00:44:12,903
How does it look, Bea, huh?
You like it, don't you?

944
00:44:12,945 --> 00:44:14,488
I don't know.
I haven't seen it.

945
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:15,948
You got to like it.

946
00:44:16,073 --> 00:44:17,032
Voil.

947
00:44:17,074 --> 00:44:20,410
This foyer is designed
to impress anybody
who walks through the door.

948
00:44:20,536 --> 00:44:23,539
It has a big
winding staircase,
just like Gone With the Wind.

949
00:44:23,622 --> 00:44:26,792
We should get
our portraits painted,
like Rhett and Scarlett.

950
00:44:27,042 --> 00:44:28,544
Bea, bring him in here.

951
00:44:28,627 --> 00:44:30,963
Ray, wait till you hear
what's waiting
in the living room.

952
00:44:31,088 --> 00:44:32,047
What is it?

953
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:35,968
I had them build you
a solid marble fireplace,
two stories high.

954
00:44:36,093 --> 00:44:38,262
Hot damn!
How do you like it, Bea?

955
00:44:38,345 --> 00:44:39,388
It's awful big.

956
00:44:39,513 --> 00:44:41,098
It sure is:
8,500 square feet.

957
00:44:41,139 --> 00:44:42,975
Biggest house in
the neighborhood.

958
00:44:43,058 --> 00:44:44,810
So, does this meet
with your approval?

959
00:44:44,852 --> 00:44:46,395
Man, this is a palace.

960
00:44:46,436 --> 00:44:48,939
You think this is big?
Wait until tomorrow
when you see

961
00:44:48,981 --> 00:44:51,275
30,000 square feet
of RPM Incorporated.

962
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,152
Yeah, headquarters!

963
00:44:53,235 --> 00:44:55,571
This is it, Ray. Your
brand-new recording studio.

964
00:44:55,654 --> 00:44:57,281
Did you get
everything I asked for?

965
00:44:57,364 --> 00:44:58,574
Totally state-of-the-art.

966
00:44:58,699 --> 00:45:02,619
Tom Dowd built
an eight-track mixing console,
two recorders, the works.

967
00:45:02,703 --> 00:45:05,164
Now, this room is bigger
than most people's houses.

968
00:45:05,164 --> 00:45:07,666
Got your own private bathroom
to your left.

969
00:45:07,708 --> 00:45:09,960
Right behind you
is my adjoining office.

970
00:45:10,002 --> 00:45:12,421
And step over
to your private bar
to your left.

971
00:45:12,462 --> 00:45:14,381
Got a bottle of Bols
right in the center.

972
00:45:14,423 --> 00:45:15,841
You know me pretty good.

973
00:45:15,883 --> 00:45:18,302
If you run out, shout,
I'm right next door.

974
00:45:18,677 --> 00:45:19,970
This is nice, right here.

975
00:45:20,012 --> 00:45:21,430
It's the house
that Ray built.

976
00:45:21,471 --> 00:45:22,598
Yes, it is.

977
00:45:22,848 --> 00:45:24,558
# Born to lose #

978
00:45:26,185 --> 00:45:29,897
# I've lived my life
in vain #

979
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:36,445
Ray Junior, slow down!

980
00:45:36,528 --> 00:45:38,322
This ain't no
baseball diamond!

981
00:45:40,866 --> 00:45:42,493
Charles residence.

982
00:45:43,202 --> 00:45:44,786
Mr. Charles?

983
00:45:45,037 --> 00:45:47,498
Hey, girl,
Bring that boy over here!

984
00:45:47,581 --> 00:45:49,750
I got a hot dog
with his name on it!
Come on, now.

985
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:51,001
Hello.

986
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:53,587
Uh, yes,
I know who you are.

987
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,049
What? Oh, God, no.

988
00:45:57,633 --> 00:45:58,509
Ray.

989
00:45:58,634 --> 00:46:02,095
Yes, I'll get on a plane
and I'll be there
as soon as I can.

990
00:46:02,221 --> 00:46:03,514
What happened?

991
00:46:05,641 --> 00:46:07,017
Margie's dead.

992
00:46:07,351 --> 00:46:09,019
Oh, God! H-How?

993
00:46:10,771 --> 00:46:12,314
She overdosed.

994
00:46:15,651 --> 00:46:17,486
I didn't start her, Bea.

995
00:46:18,612 --> 00:46:20,072
I didn't let her
do dope around me.

996
00:46:20,197 --> 00:46:22,115
I... I just wouldn't
let that happen.

997
00:46:22,241 --> 00:46:25,494
Yes, I'm sure, Ray.
I'm sure you set
a fine example.

998
00:46:29,623 --> 00:46:31,375
What about her baby?

999
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:37,089
You knew?

1000
00:46:37,881 --> 00:46:39,842
His name is Charles Wayne.

1001
00:46:40,259 --> 00:46:44,096
He was born October 1,
in New York City.
He's 3 years old.

1002
00:46:45,097 --> 00:46:46,557
The baby's fine.

1003
00:46:47,474 --> 00:46:49,268
He's at her sister's.

1004
00:46:51,061 --> 00:46:52,980
All right.
I'll start sending them
some money.

1005
00:46:53,105 --> 00:46:56,150
You don't have to.
I send them
money every month.

1006
00:47:21,008 --> 00:47:22,593
In five minutes,
Mr. Charles will be here,

1007
00:47:22,718 --> 00:47:24,178
and he'll be ready to go.

1008
00:47:24,261 --> 00:47:25,762
Now the charts
Jeff is handing out

1009
00:47:25,888 --> 00:47:28,682
should be turned in
at the conclusion of...

1010
00:47:29,141 --> 00:47:31,310
You're late,
that's a $50 fine.

1011
00:47:31,894 --> 00:47:33,312
I ain't late.

1012
00:47:33,437 --> 00:47:35,481
I give them
a 10-minute grace period, Joe.

1013
00:47:35,606 --> 00:47:38,901
2:05. He's late.
He'll be charged $50.

1014
00:47:38,984 --> 00:47:41,445
What? You know what?
Where's Ray?

1015
00:47:41,528 --> 00:47:43,906
You don't have to talk to Ray,
you're talking to me.

1016
00:47:43,989 --> 00:47:48,160
I'll talk to whoever
I damn well please,
and it sure as hell ain't you.

1017
00:47:48,202 --> 00:47:49,578
Jive jerk.

1018
00:47:54,333 --> 00:47:55,459
Hey, Ray,

1019
00:47:55,501 --> 00:47:59,630
this fool Joe Adams
is trying to fine me
for being late.

1020
00:48:00,005 --> 00:48:01,465
What time did you get here?

1021
00:48:01,507 --> 00:48:05,511
What? Just now.
The band's still setting up.

1022
00:48:06,094 --> 00:48:07,763
Jeff don't...
Look, I'm not Jeff.

1023
00:48:07,804 --> 00:48:09,598
That's a fact, Jack!

1024
00:48:10,766 --> 00:48:13,435
Ray, you said
the band was my thing.

1025
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:14,937
It is.

1026
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:17,648
Then, Fathead,
you go on back to rehearsal.

1027
00:48:18,732 --> 00:48:20,067
Ray.

1028
00:48:20,526 --> 00:48:22,945
Ray, you know how it is,
you've been there.

1029
00:48:23,529 --> 00:48:25,823
Fathead, go on now.
Let me handle this.

1030
00:48:25,906 --> 00:48:27,658
Fathead, go on now.

1031
00:48:31,078 --> 00:48:33,163
You want to tell me
what the hell
is going on, Ray?

1032
00:48:33,247 --> 00:48:35,249
I'm not doing anything
I haven't been asked to.

1033
00:48:35,374 --> 00:48:36,917
Ray's running a business.

1034
00:48:36,959 --> 00:48:39,962
He shouldn't
have to waste time
hearing why people were late.

1035
00:48:40,087 --> 00:48:41,839
I'm not talking
to you, Joe.

1036
00:48:41,964 --> 00:48:43,674
I'm talking to Ray.

1037
00:48:48,679 --> 00:48:51,557
Ray, now I know you think
I'm soft on the band,

1038
00:48:51,682 --> 00:48:54,059
but those cats would do
whatever I ask.

1039
00:48:54,101 --> 00:48:56,770
But If you come in here
with this, uh,
"running a business" crap,

1040
00:48:56,854 --> 00:48:59,064
you're gonna lose
some good people.
I'm telling you, Ray.

1041
00:48:59,148 --> 00:49:01,567
There are musicians
waiting in line
to play with Ray Charles.

1042
00:49:01,567 --> 00:49:04,403
Not for long,
once they get a taste of you.

1043
00:49:05,112 --> 00:49:07,364
Ray, you're the leader, man.
Be one! Come on, now.

1044
00:49:07,406 --> 00:49:09,408
You now what Jeff, I mean
things have changed.

1045
00:49:09,449 --> 00:49:12,536
It ain't like the days
when it was seven of us
on the Chitlin' Circuit.

1046
00:49:12,578 --> 00:49:16,081
I mean, if you weren't busy
building a bowling alley,
you'd seen that.

1047
00:49:16,498 --> 00:49:18,292
So you know about that, huh?

1048
00:49:18,709 --> 00:49:20,711
I know about everything.

1049
00:49:21,295 --> 00:49:23,297
I'm just trying to figure out
how you did it.

1050
00:49:23,338 --> 00:49:25,007
You think
I'm stealing from you, Ray?

1051
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:28,302
If the Shaw Agency is gonna
give you a cut of
the 10 percent I'm given them.

1052
00:49:28,427 --> 00:49:31,388
I might as well keep
the goddamn money
in my pocket.

1053
00:49:31,597 --> 00:49:33,891
Leave us alone.
We need to talk.

1054
00:49:35,017 --> 00:49:36,101
Ray.

1055
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,562
You can step outside, Joe.

1056
00:49:40,439 --> 00:49:42,191
I'll be in my office.

1057
00:49:47,613 --> 00:49:51,575
Ray, now I know
that jealous bastard
planted that lie in your head.

1058
00:49:52,701 --> 00:49:55,162
But I have never stolen
from you, Ray,
and I never will.

1059
00:49:55,245 --> 00:49:59,041
I got a small business loan,
and, yeah, Milt Shaw
was giving me a little extra,

1060
00:49:59,124 --> 00:50:00,751
but I'm not a thief, Ray.

1061
00:50:00,792 --> 00:50:02,169
Then what about that,
Jeff, huh?

1062
00:50:02,211 --> 00:50:06,340
A promoter swearing you did
side deals with him so
you could split my overages!

1063
00:50:06,423 --> 00:50:08,217
How could you do that to me?

1064
00:50:08,342 --> 00:50:10,427
We've been through so much,
we be so like brothers.

1065
00:50:10,511 --> 00:50:12,221
You know what, Ray?

1066
00:50:13,305 --> 00:50:16,350
If we were like brothers,

1067
00:50:16,642 --> 00:50:19,061
why are you paying Joe
more than you're paying me?

1068
00:50:19,144 --> 00:50:21,522
Damn all that!
You broke my heart, man.

1069
00:50:21,605 --> 00:50:25,943
Well, you know what, Ray?
You broke mine
a long goddamn time ago!

1070
00:50:26,777 --> 00:50:28,654
Well, then there it is.

1071
00:50:35,327 --> 00:50:36,954
You know something, Ray?

1072
00:50:37,037 --> 00:50:38,831
You're going to get yours
one day.

1073
00:50:38,914 --> 00:50:42,668
And I pray to God that he
has mercy on your soul,
you son of a bitch!

1074
00:50:50,509 --> 00:50:52,511
Everything all right, Ray?

1075
00:50:53,762 --> 00:50:56,014
How the hell
do you think it is?

1076
00:51:06,733 --> 00:51:10,112
Go tell him. Go tell him!
Go, go tell him.

1077
00:51:11,697 --> 00:51:12,990
Hey, Dad. Hi, there.

1078
00:51:13,115 --> 00:51:15,159
I made the all-star team!
The game's on Thursday.

1079
00:51:15,159 --> 00:51:16,285
Oh, that's great.

1080
00:51:16,368 --> 00:51:19,079
Oh, damn!
I'm not gonna be in town.
I'm gotta go on tour.

1081
00:51:19,163 --> 00:51:21,707
How about I buy you guys
new uniforms, huh?

1082
00:51:21,832 --> 00:51:23,834
Tell the coach
I don't care
how much they cost.

1083
00:51:23,876 --> 00:51:24,877
Okay.

1084
00:51:24,877 --> 00:51:27,462
All right, son,
you want to take
your dad's briefcase inside.

1085
00:51:27,546 --> 00:51:30,174
The plane to Montreal
leaves at 11:00.
I'll pick you up at 8:30.

1086
00:51:30,257 --> 00:51:31,258
All right.

1087
00:51:31,717 --> 00:51:33,719
Did you hear what
Ray Junior said to you?

1088
00:51:33,802 --> 00:51:34,720
Yeah.

1089
00:51:34,761 --> 00:51:37,139
Do you know how much
making the all-star team
means to him?

1090
00:51:37,181 --> 00:51:39,683
I know.
I got things on my mind.
We had to fire Jeff.

1091
00:51:39,725 --> 00:51:40,726
What?

1092
00:51:40,809 --> 00:51:41,852
He was stealing.

1093
00:51:41,894 --> 00:51:43,020
Jeff?
Hmm.

1094
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:44,313
I don't believe it.

1095
00:51:44,438 --> 00:51:46,398
Yeah, well,
we're better without him.

1096
00:51:46,565 --> 00:51:49,026
# My mother told me #

1097
00:51:53,822 --> 00:51:56,450
# 'Fore she passed away #

1098
00:51:57,910 --> 00:52:01,622
# Said son when I'm gone #

1099
00:52:01,997 --> 00:52:03,916
# Don't forget to pray #

1100
00:52:03,999 --> 00:52:06,293
# 'Cause there'll be
hard times #

1101
00:52:08,879 --> 00:52:11,423
# Hard times #

1102
00:52:11,507 --> 00:52:14,426
# Oh, yeah, yeah #

1103
00:52:14,468 --> 00:52:18,055
# Who knows better than I #

1104
00:52:47,417 --> 00:52:48,836
Excuse me!
Get 'em out!

1105
00:52:49,253 --> 00:52:50,963
U.S. Customs!

1106
00:52:51,088 --> 00:52:53,382
We're goanna need
to see some identification,
please.

1107
00:52:53,465 --> 00:52:55,175
You just arrived
from Montreal?

1108
00:52:55,259 --> 00:52:56,635
Yes. Is there a problem?

1109
00:52:56,677 --> 00:52:59,054
We were alerted
there might be drugs
on this plane.

1110
00:52:59,096 --> 00:53:01,431
What? That's outrageous!
I'm going to call our lawyer.

1111
00:53:01,557 --> 00:53:03,767
No lawyers
at international checkpoints.

1112
00:53:03,851 --> 00:53:06,395
Now, we're going
to have to search
everyone on this plane.

1113
00:53:06,478 --> 00:53:09,148
Mr. Charles,
if you don't mind
we'd like to start with you.

1114
00:53:09,273 --> 00:53:11,108
I'd like to see your overcoat.

1115
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:12,401
I don't mind.

1116
00:53:12,442 --> 00:53:13,902
Don't say anything, Ray.

1117
00:53:14,528 --> 00:53:15,571
What's this?

1118
00:53:17,573 --> 00:53:19,950
Ray, this isn't some judge
in Indiana.

1119
00:53:19,992 --> 00:53:22,035
It's federal.
They can charge you
of smuggling

1120
00:53:22,161 --> 00:53:23,829
which can mean
real prison time.

1121
00:53:25,164 --> 00:53:28,125
Our lawyers will do
what they can, but...

1122
00:53:47,895 --> 00:53:49,188
Hello.

1123
00:53:51,315 --> 00:53:53,192
You can't hide out
in here forever, Ray.

1124
00:53:53,317 --> 00:53:55,152
Look, it's my house.
I'm not in prison yet.

1125
00:53:55,194 --> 00:53:56,278
No, it's my house.

1126
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:59,198
You ain't been here
more than six days
since we moved in.

1127
00:53:59,281 --> 00:54:01,325
No, Ray, no! A needle
ain't gonna solve this!

1128
00:54:01,408 --> 00:54:02,326
Get out of the way.
Move!

1129
00:54:02,451 --> 00:54:04,286
Only thing
that can help you is God, Ray.

1130
00:54:04,328 --> 00:54:07,039
Don't think of God?
Do you have any idea
how it feels to go blind

1131
00:54:07,122 --> 00:54:08,499
and still be afraid
of the dark?

1132
00:54:08,624 --> 00:54:11,752
And every day, you stand pray
for just a little light,
and you get nothing.

1133
00:54:11,877 --> 00:54:13,629
'Cause God don't listen
to people like me.

1134
00:54:13,754 --> 00:54:14,796
Stop talking like that.

1135
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,758
As far as I'm concerned,
me and God is even
and I do what I please.

1136
00:54:17,883 --> 00:54:19,927
If goddamn it,
if I want to shoot up,
I shoot up.

1137
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:22,638
Then go ahead!
But you walk out that door

1138
00:54:22,763 --> 00:54:25,098
and I'm doing something
I should have done
a long time ago.

1139
00:54:25,224 --> 00:54:26,934
I'm taking my boys
and I'll leave.

1140
00:54:27,017 --> 00:54:29,019
You're not going away.
You... you have no place to go.

1141
00:54:29,061 --> 00:54:30,646
No place?
No.

1142
00:54:30,729 --> 00:54:32,815
You think I'm
scared of losing this?

1143
00:54:32,898 --> 00:54:35,818
Ray, the only thing I was
ever scared of losing
was you.

1144
00:54:35,901 --> 00:54:39,029
Because where was
I ever gonna find
another Ray Robinson?

1145
00:54:40,531 --> 00:54:43,075
So I put up with
some terrible stuff.

1146
00:54:43,325 --> 00:54:45,118
Maybe that makes me
part to blame.

1147
00:54:45,244 --> 00:54:46,537
But I ain't scared
no more.

1148
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:49,331
You know I love you
and those boys
more than anything.

1149
00:54:49,373 --> 00:54:51,834
That is a damn lie
and you know it!

1150
00:54:53,377 --> 00:54:55,045
You ever look at this?

1151
00:54:55,254 --> 00:54:57,548
Really look at it, Ray!

1152
00:54:57,881 --> 00:55:00,926
Ray Charles Junior's
"Most Valuable Player."

1153
00:55:02,386 --> 00:55:04,555
He was so proud this day,

1154
00:55:05,556 --> 00:55:09,476
until you came home too loaded
to go to his banquet.

1155
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:12,813
No! No! There is something
you love more than
me and them boys,

1156
00:55:12,855 --> 00:55:15,566
more than all the women
you ever slept with
on the road,

1157
00:55:15,566 --> 00:55:17,234
more than all
the dope you ever took.

1158
00:55:17,276 --> 00:55:19,653
What are you talking about?
Your music.

1159
00:55:21,572 --> 00:55:23,866
And if you don't stop
using that needle,

1160
00:55:23,991 --> 00:55:27,119
they're gonna
take away your music
and put you in jail.

1161
00:55:30,998 --> 00:55:33,375
Is that poison
worth losing everything?

1162
00:56:15,501 --> 00:56:17,085
Mr. Charles?

1163
00:56:29,515 --> 00:56:31,016
Mr. Charles.

1164
00:56:31,642 --> 00:56:33,477
You don't have to
go through this.

1165
00:56:34,353 --> 00:56:38,190
We have a substitute
that can help
wean you off heroin.

1166
00:56:38,524 --> 00:56:42,736
I have to do it on my own.
I can do it. I can do it.

1167
00:56:43,487 --> 00:56:44,905
Ah. Don't touch me.

1168
00:56:48,242 --> 00:56:49,535
All right.

1169
00:56:50,077 --> 00:56:51,829
We'll do it your way.

1170
00:57:02,881 --> 00:57:04,216
Doctor?

1171
00:57:04,508 --> 00:57:07,511
Mr. Charles. Mr. Charles,
I'm coming.

1172
00:57:08,262 --> 00:57:09,972
He's got no fluids left.

1173
00:57:10,097 --> 00:57:11,849
Get an I.V.
In him right away.

1174
00:57:12,266 --> 00:57:14,101
I'll insert the needle.
No needles.

1175
00:57:14,226 --> 00:57:16,145
Yes. It's very important.
You need this.

1176
00:57:16,228 --> 00:57:18,147
Runner, I've got a runner!

1177
00:57:18,814 --> 00:57:19,815
Whoa.

1178
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,777
Let me go. Let me go.
Get him on the bed.

1179
00:57:24,403 --> 00:57:26,864
Put those restraints on him.

1180
00:57:27,364 --> 00:57:28,949
No needles.

1181
00:57:47,176 --> 00:57:48,677
No, no.

1182
00:57:49,678 --> 00:57:51,013
Oh.

1183
00:57:55,017 --> 00:57:57,394
George, I miss you.
I miss you, George.

1184
00:57:57,478 --> 00:57:59,855
I miss you.

1185
00:58:04,485 --> 00:58:05,819
Oh.

1186
00:58:18,999 --> 00:58:20,584
Okay. Uh-oh.

1187
00:58:20,626 --> 00:58:22,920
You might be in trouble
right there, Doc.

1188
00:58:31,929 --> 00:58:34,223
Hot damn,
you whupped my ass again!

1189
00:58:34,348 --> 00:58:37,059
I-I'll tell you what,
I won't lose again
the same way twice.

1190
00:58:37,184 --> 00:58:40,646
I spoke with
the judge in Boston,
and he'll agree to probation.

1191
00:58:40,938 --> 00:58:43,232
He was impressed with
your attorney's arguments,

1192
00:58:43,315 --> 00:58:45,359
and he believes
you deserve one more chance.

1193
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,819
Oh, that's great.

1194
00:58:46,902 --> 00:58:48,904
But you must
complete our program

1195
00:58:49,029 --> 00:58:51,031
and agree to take
periodic drug tests.

1196
00:58:51,073 --> 00:58:53,325
You know what. I'll do it.
I know people don't believe

1197
00:58:53,367 --> 00:58:55,619
I'm done with this dope,
but I'm finished.

1198
00:58:56,537 --> 00:58:57,871
Who's George?

1199
00:59:02,668 --> 00:59:03,794
Ray,

1200
00:59:04,378 --> 00:59:07,172
you've come through
the worst of
the physical reactions.

1201
00:59:07,798 --> 00:59:10,634
We should begin
psychotherapy sessions.

1202
00:59:10,676 --> 00:59:13,262
Uh, look, forget
the head shrinking, Doc.

1203
00:59:13,345 --> 00:59:14,972
I can handle this.

1204
00:59:19,351 --> 00:59:20,811
Mr. Charles,

1205
00:59:20,853 --> 00:59:23,522
you're not the first
celebrity junkie I've treated.

1206
00:59:23,564 --> 00:59:24,690
Junkie? What...

1207
00:59:24,815 --> 00:59:26,817
Nobody cons me
at any price.

1208
00:59:26,859 --> 00:59:27,943
I'm not trying
to do that.

1209
00:59:27,985 --> 00:59:31,155
If you want me
to give that judge
a positive report,

1210
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,240
you will have to earn it.

1211
00:59:36,702 --> 00:59:37,744
Doc?

1212
00:59:38,704 --> 00:59:40,205
Dr. Hacker?

1213
00:59:40,706 --> 00:59:41,707
Doc?

1214
01:00:14,198 --> 01:00:17,034
Ray, come on, Ray,
play with me!

1215
01:00:21,038 --> 01:00:22,706
He ain't there.

1216
01:00:31,048 --> 01:00:32,925
Talk to me, son.

1217
01:00:33,926 --> 01:00:37,387
I ain't no bad dream.
I'm a part of you.

1218
01:00:37,763 --> 01:00:40,224
Even all that dope
couldn't keep me away.

1219
01:00:43,227 --> 01:00:45,229
Mama, I kept my promise.

1220
01:00:45,354 --> 01:00:47,231
You got strong all right.

1221
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:49,066
Went places
I never dreamed of.

1222
01:00:49,817 --> 01:00:52,069
But you still
became a cripple.

1223
01:00:57,825 --> 01:00:59,910
Come here, baby.
Come here.

1224
01:01:07,543 --> 01:01:08,669
Ray?

1225
01:01:15,217 --> 01:01:16,927
It wasn't your fault.

1226
01:01:22,349 --> 01:01:23,851
Now promise us

1227
01:01:24,143 --> 01:01:25,853
you'll never let
nobody or nothing

1228
01:01:25,936 --> 01:01:28,272
turn you into
no cripple ever again.

1229
01:01:28,438 --> 01:01:31,441
That you'll always stand
on your own two feet.

1230
01:01:32,442 --> 01:01:33,569
Promise.

1231
01:01:54,548 --> 01:01:56,592
Today we're here
to right a wrong

1232
01:01:56,675 --> 01:02:00,137
that was done to one
of our native sons
nearly 20 years ago.

1233
01:02:00,679 --> 01:02:02,139
In 1961,

1234
01:02:02,681 --> 01:02:05,851
Ray Charles was banned
from performing
in the state of Georgia

1235
01:02:05,976 --> 01:02:09,104
because he refused to play
before a segregated audience.

1236
01:02:09,313 --> 01:02:12,316
Thankfully, we've come
a long way since then.

1237
01:02:12,733 --> 01:02:16,111
Some of us have fought
for equality through
the political process,

1238
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:20,699
but Ray Charles
changed American culture
by touching people's hearts.

1239
01:02:21,033 --> 01:02:24,786
So on this day,
March 7, 1979,

1240
01:02:25,329 --> 01:02:28,499
we, the duly
elected representatives
of the state of Georgia

1241
01:02:28,874 --> 01:02:32,794
not only proclaim
Georgia on My Mind
our official state song,

1242
01:02:33,212 --> 01:02:36,340
we also offer Mr. Ray Charles
a public apology

1243
01:02:36,465 --> 01:02:38,342
and welcome him back home.

1244
01:02:47,184 --> 01:02:51,939
# Every time
I sing this song #

1245
01:02:58,237 --> 01:03:00,364
If only your mama was here.

1246
01:03:01,031 --> 01:03:02,366
She's here.

1247
01:03:03,033 --> 01:03:04,827
She ain't never left.

1248
01:03:05,077 --> 01:03:06,662
# I sing for #

1249
01:03:09,248 --> 01:03:11,124
# Georgia #

1250
01:03:14,253 --> 01:03:16,839
# Whoa, Georgia #

1251
01:03:19,925 --> 01:03:22,970
# The whole day through #

1252
01:03:26,098 --> 01:03:28,225
# Just this old, sweet song #

1253
01:03:31,979 --> 01:03:35,732
# Keeps Georgia on my mind #

1254
01:03:43,657 --> 01:03:45,868
# Georgia #

1255
01:03:45,951 --> 01:03:47,703
# Oh, yeah #

1256
01:03:50,998 --> 01:03:54,001
# Yeah, Georgia #

1257
01:03:56,670 --> 01:04:00,716
# A song of you #

1258
01:04:04,136 --> 01:04:06,305
# Comes as sweet and clear #

1259
01:04:09,725 --> 01:04:14,480
# as moonlight
through the pines #

1260
01:04:21,153 --> 01:04:23,030
# I feel that #

1261
01:04:25,157 --> 01:04:29,745
# Other arms #

1262
01:04:34,041 --> 01:04:38,754
# reach out to me #

1263
01:04:43,634 --> 01:04:47,930
# Other eyes #

1264
01:04:52,601 --> 01:04:54,186
# smile #

1265
01:04:56,814 --> 01:04:59,358
# tenderly #

1266
01:05:00,192 --> 01:05:01,944
# Well, all right now #

1267
01:05:02,528 --> 01:05:04,029
# Yeah #

1268
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:11,954
# Don't you know? #

1269
01:05:18,252 --> 01:05:21,922
# Still in peaceful dreams #

1270
01:05:23,924 --> 01:05:26,802
# I see a busy road #

1271
01:05:27,845 --> 01:05:31,682
# The road leads back to you #

1272
01:05:43,235 --> 01:05:44,987
# Oh, Georgia #

1273
01:05:47,656 --> 01:05:49,741
# No peace I find #

1274
01:05:50,242 --> 01:05:52,244
# Please stop by #

1275
01:05:52,744 --> 01:05:54,705
# Don't you hear me now? #

1276
01:05:54,872 --> 01:05:58,417
# Just this old, sweet song #

1277
01:05:58,709 --> 01:06:02,045
# I say, oh, I say #

1278
01:06:02,421 --> 01:06:06,175
# Keeps Georgia on my mind #

1279
01:06:08,552 --> 01:06:11,054
# On my mind #

1280
01:06:14,141 --> 01:06:15,851
# On my mind #

1281
01:06:16,894 --> 01:06:18,187
# Yeah #

1282
01:06:23,442 --> 01:06:25,027
# Keeps Georgia #

1283
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:27,821
# On my mind #

1284
01:06:27,905 --> 01:06:31,742
# You know that the little
girls are on my mind, huh? #

1285
01:06:34,495 --> 01:06:37,206
# Yes, it did, now, yeah #

1286
01:06:46,632 --> 01:06:48,425
# Unchain my heart #

1287
01:06:48,467 --> 01:06:49,927
# Unchain my heart #

1288
01:06:49,927 --> 01:06:51,595
# Baby, let me be #

1289
01:06:51,637 --> 01:06:53,055
# Unchain my heart #

1290
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:54,640
# Unchain my heart #

1291
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,058
# Unchain my heart #

1292
01:06:56,141 --> 01:06:57,768
# 'Cause you don't
care about me #

1293
01:06:57,851 --> 01:06:59,812
# Unchain my heart #

1294
01:07:00,312 --> 01:07:03,649
# You've got me sewed up
like a pillow case #

1295
01:07:03,941 --> 01:07:06,068
# But you let my love
go to waste #

1296
01:07:06,109 --> 01:07:10,364
# So unchain my heart,
oh please,
please set me free #

1297
01:07:11,824 --> 01:07:13,659
# Unchain my heart #

1298
01:07:13,742 --> 01:07:15,118
# Unchain my heart #

1299
01:07:15,244 --> 01:07:16,787
# Baby, let me go #

1300
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:18,372
# Unchain my heart #

1301
01:07:18,497 --> 01:07:20,082
# Unchain my heart #

1302
01:07:20,165 --> 01:07:21,333
# Unchain my heart #

1303
01:07:21,375 --> 01:07:22,960
# 'cause you don't love me
no more #

1304
01:07:23,043 --> 01:07:25,045
# Unchain my heart #

1305
01:07:26,213 --> 01:07:28,799
# Every time I call you
on the phone #

1306
01:07:28,966 --> 01:07:31,468
# Some fella tells me that
you're not at home #

1307
01:07:31,552 --> 01:07:35,514
# So unchain my heart,
oh please,
please set me free #

1308
01:08:02,416 --> 01:08:04,418
# I'm under your spell #

1309
01:08:04,543 --> 01:08:05,669
# I'm under your spell #

1310
01:08:05,711 --> 01:08:07,296
# Like a man in a trance #

1311
01:08:07,337 --> 01:08:09,298
# Like a man in a trance #

1312
01:08:09,381 --> 01:08:10,591
# But I know darn well #

1313
01:08:10,674 --> 01:08:11,884
# I know darn well #

1314
01:08:12,009 --> 01:08:13,677
# that I don't
stand a chance #

1315
01:08:13,719 --> 01:08:15,012
# I don't stand a chance #

1316
01:08:15,012 --> 01:08:16,847
# So, unchain my heart #

1317
01:08:16,889 --> 01:08:18,432
# Unchain my heart #

1318
01:08:18,515 --> 01:08:19,892
# Let me go my way #

1319
01:08:19,975 --> 01:08:21,518
# Unchain my heart #

1320
01:08:21,602 --> 01:08:23,145
# Unchain my heart #

1321
01:08:23,187 --> 01:08:24,771
# Unchain my heart #

1322
01:08:24,897 --> 01:08:26,315
# You worry me night and day #

1323
01:08:26,398 --> 01:08:28,484
# Unchain my heart #

1324
01:08:29,193 --> 01:08:31,737
# Why lead me
through a life of misery #

1325
01:08:32,362 --> 01:08:34,698
# When you don't care
a bag of beans for me #

1326
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:38,744
# So unchain my heart,
please, please set me free #

1327
01:08:38,869 --> 01:08:40,204
# Please set me free #

1328
01:08:40,245 --> 01:08:41,830
# Oh, won't you set me free #

1329
01:08:41,914 --> 01:08:43,457
# Please set me free #

1330
01:08:43,499 --> 01:08:45,042
# Whoa, set me free #

1331
01:08:45,125 --> 01:08:47,169
# Please set me free #

1332
01:08:47,211 --> 01:08:48,629
# Wow, set me free #
