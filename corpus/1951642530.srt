As much as in the day

35
00:03:45,327--> 00:03:46,424
Hopefully it will be contagious

36
00:03:46,424--> 00:03:47,924
I could be immune

37
00:03:48,526--> 00:03:49,806
And the one what with the party happens?

00:04:05,820--> 00:04:06,875
Actually not.

45
00:04:08,064--> 00:04:09,374
He/she walks, we go!

46
00:04:09,374--> 00:04:12,120
Why is not going with me
to the room of the female dogs?

47
00:04:12,325--> 00:04:14,927
<i> AND IF it had been more...</i>

48
00:04:14,927--> 00:04:18,194
And it would not go with you
there inside unless...

49
00:04:18,407--> 00:04:19,585
... it was the last female dog of the world.

50

Can I take for trip?

58
00:04:47,187--> 00:04:48,216
This well, this well...

59
00:05:01,573--> 00:05:02,742
He/she comes with the dad!

60
00:05:03,872--> 00:05:04,873
I want to hear his/her story

61
00:05:07,295--> 00:05:09,264
Yes, we will have fun...

62
00:05:10,725--> 00:05:12,109
It was once a dog

63
00:05:12,324--> 00:05:13,689
with a horror life

64
00:05:14,951--> 00:05:16,237
but he/she didn't fear anybody

65
00:05:17,649--> 00:05:19,822
he/she had some teeth
very sharp

66
00:05:21,087--> 00:05:22,785
and the full belly...

67
00:05:24,395--> 00:05:25,996
but with an empty heart

68
00:05:26,578--> 00:05:28,012
therefore he/she wanted to leave traveling

69
00:05:29,165--> 00:05:31,209
for a place a lot, very far

70
00:05:32,786--> 00:05:35,622
It ties that arrived one day
a wide stick...

71
00:05:36,083--> 00:05:39,026
With a ring in the tip

72
00:05:40,360--> 00:05:41,642
And he invited to enter

73
00:05:42,500--> 00:05:46,982
the dog was hypnotized

74
00:05:48,251--> 00:05:49,533
And on this night...

75
00:05:49,974--> 00:05:53,259
An enormous cloud of smoke
leave the chimney

76
00:05:53,774--> 00:05:55,041
but with

77
00:05:55,448--> 00:05:57,651
a horrible smell

78
00:05:58,330--> 00:05:59,178
because he/she will see

79
00:05:59,829--> 00:06:01,247
The man was from China

80
00:06:02,295--> 00:06:03,687
And in China

81
00:06:04,969--> 00:06:06,800
The dogs are eaten

82
00:06:14,070--> 00:06:15,732
Let us see who and his/her owner

83
00:06:34,674--> 00:06:35,768
Curse!

84
00:06:38,794--> 00:06:40,991
An easy work, hein?

85
00:06:42,398--> 00:06:43,226
Good Ta...

86
00:06:44,508--> 00:06:45,836
I can live with one
little of critic

87
00:07:16,688--> 00:07:17,714
I don't believe

88
00:07:22,352--> 00:07:23,357
Very well friend

89
00:07:23,989--> 00:07:24,961
Be quiet

90
00:07:30,159--> 00:07:31,413
Now the where you were?

91

<i> I Destine </i>

92
00:08:25,721--> 00:08:26,953
<i> Maybe the word is big
too much for him </i>

93
00:08:27,735--> 00:08:31,085
<i> If it had been gentile with Cybill
she would not have ordering me behind of that dog </i>

94
00:08:31,417--> 00:08:33,298
<i> it is then I would not have me late
with Agatha this night </i>

95
00:08:33,951--> 00:08:35,437
<i> AND nothing of that would have happened </i>

96
00:08:36,676--> 00:08:37,702
<i> But I was late </i>

97
00:08:38,814--> 00:08:39,987
<i> and that was enough </i>

98
00:08:43,686--> 00:08:44,462
He/she only looks

99
00:08:45,154--> 00:08:46,240
Yes, he/she tries not to vomit

100
00:08:47,685--> 00:08:49,151
Cursed dog of the hell

101
00:08:50,029--> 00:08:51,002
I go kill him/it.

102
00:08:52,210--> 00:08:54,192
It is will be like this a...

103
00:08:54,935--> 00:08:55,873
<u > Damned dog killed of the hell.</u>

104
00:08:56,255--> 00:08:57,188
He/she breathes bottom.

105
00:08:57,719--> 00:08:58,840
Everything will be well.

106
00:08:59,762--> 00:09:01,364
And remember that and yours has a birthday.

107
00:09:02,826--> 00:09:03,559
He/she had not thought about that.

108
00:09:04,241--> 00:09:06,410
Why have to see
do their friends in mine have a birthday?

109
00:09:08,443--> 00:09:09,980
Maybe because you don't have friends.

110
00:09:13,773--> 00:09:14,741
He/she makes sense.

111
00:09:15,230--> 00:09:18,968
Well, I am old, I am deformed,
and I have to live at the hell.

112
00:09:18,968--> 00:09:19,765
No.

113
00:09:20,703--> 00:09:22,072
And haul of that have you to stand.

114
00:09:22,619--> 00:09:26,225
Of face it is noticed that this very well
compared with other.

115
00:09:26,831--> 00:09:28,566
Well, I am also crazy.

116
00:09:28,566--> 00:09:30,011
I will wait for the film.

117
00:09:30,576--> 00:09:31,587
Didn't he/she forget of anything?

118
00:09:32,369--> 00:09:34,221
Of the one what?

119
00:09:35,207--> 00:09:36,127

123
00:09:50,494--> 00:09:51,469

February 3 makes me to be aquariano

128
00:09:59,865--> 00:10:02,039

friends are extremely vital.

All of the characters of this book are fictitious.

139

And any one similar to any
person lives or died...

140

141

It was good the party.

142
00:11:14,329--> 00:11:15,644
What does the one know?

It will be romantic.

146
00:11:21,467--> 00:11:22,609
But also this cold.

147
00:11:23,924--> 00:11:25,179
He/she catches my coat.

148
00:11:25,504--> 00:11:27,265
I tie you!

149
00:11:33,979--> 00:11:35,882
Mom, dad... Hi for you!

150
00:11:37,517--> 00:11:41,897
He/she hoped he/she was sleeping,
it was not for being hearing anything.

151
00:11:47,224--> 00:11:49,052
Dad, I forgot to give you this.

152
00:11:52,083--> 00:11:53,519
I wrapped.

153
00:11:54,492--> 00:11:56,549
This getting better more and more.

154
00:11:58,467--> 00:11:58,925
Did you wrap him/it?

155
00:11:59,528--> 00:12:00,198
Clear...

156
00:12:01,437--> 00:12:02,085
Good, very well.

00:12:09,156--> 00:12:10,972
With certainty dad, good night...
Happy I have a birthday!

161
00:12:11,518--> 00:12:12,616
Thank you.

162
00:12:14,783--> 00:12:16,846
THE FATHER OF THE YEAR.

163

Chapter 1.

164
00:12:25,547--> 00:12:26,835
I can call myself of Fingerling.

165
00:12:27,983--> 00:12:29,262
No and my true name.

166
00:12:30,537--> 00:12:31,933
It comes from a book that I read when he/she was child.

167
00:12:33,334--> 00:12:34,417
Fingerlin in the zoo.

168
00:12:35,880--> 00:12:37,676
The leaves were consumed at times,

169
00:12:38,292--> 00:12:40,906
he/she had a green layer, with texture,

170
00:12:42,251--> 00:12:43,566
and it was probably
my first book.

171
00:12:45,240--> 00:12:48,500
Love, no longer I remember more
on what it was...

172
00:12:49,995--> 00:12:51,564
the only thing that I remember and the name.

173
00:12:52,573--> 00:12:53,597
Fingerling.

174
00:12:54,648--> 00:12:55,800
He/she always wanted that went mine.

175

It is now and.

176
00:13:00,747--> 00:13:02,528
February 4.

177
00:13:12,575--> 00:13:13,977
And his/her first fight?

178
00:13:14,490--> 00:13:15,533
With an animal, yes.

179
00:13:16,786--> 00:13:19,984
My wife and defender of the animals.

180
00:13:20,957--> 00:13:23,082
Talk me about that animal that you fought.

181
00:13:23,845--> 00:13:25,479
What would make if he/she found him/it again?

182
00:13:26,177--> 00:13:29,797
It would arise in my van and it accelerated
he/she ties to hear a "tugh."

183
00:13:33,671--> 00:13:35,221
He/she excuses, he/she was playing...

184
00:13:35,940--> 00:13:37,058
That was stupidity.

185
00:13:37,869--> 00:13:41,416
Mister, the rules of the animal control
they are that any official...

186
00:13:41,416--> 00:13:46,138
... that has been attacked by an animal owes
to have to help psychological for a period of 7 days...

187
00:13:46,857--> 00:13:48,590
... to revalue his/her mental state.

188
00:13:49,015--> 00:13:50,389
I served him my arm in a plate...

189
00:13:51,167--> 00:13:53,152
... I cannot be crazy for that.

190
00:13:53,992--> 00:13:56,605
I committed a mistake, he/she writes down there,
I know that committed a mistake.

191
00:13:57,258--> 00:13:58,051
And my fault.

192
00:13:59,454--> 00:14:02,640
And I eat when he/she said my wife that
she could choose the color of the walls of the room.

193
00:14:04,320--> 00:14:05,697
It was not a very intelligent idea.

194
00:14:10,781--> 00:14:12,737
Have a good morning, Mr. Sparrow

195
00:14:13,219--> 00:14:16,061
No, I think you and the person
more intelligent than I know.

196
00:14:18,484--> 00:14:19,867
But I am not sure.

197
00:14:21,161--> 00:14:23,286
He/she looks, I like the work and I am good in that.

198
00:14:24,856--> 00:14:25,922
It can already go.

199
00:14:26,693--> 00:14:27,903
Yes, but...

200
00:14:27,903--> 00:14:29,156
Don't worry.

201
00:14:29,471--> 00:14:32,483
No and that it is badly, I do for his/her good.

202
00:14:33,357--> 00:14:34,535
You no and dangerous for anybody.

203
00:14:35,110--> 00:14:37,037
Therefore it can go and to remove the day off.

204
00:14:38,279--> 00:14:39,442
Truth?

205
00:14:42,060--> 00:14:43,001
Clear.

206
00:14:43,645--> 00:14:44,434
Mr. Sparrow.

207
00:14:45,034--> 00:14:47,419
What did his/her color wife choose for the walls?

208
00:14:47,419--> 00:14:48,466
Red.

209
00:14:49,359--> 00:14:50,369
He/she chose red.

210
00:14:57,780--> 00:14:59,178
Chapter 2.

211
00:15:02,524--> 00:15:04,206
He/she imagines me is gotten.

212
00:15:05,437--> 00:15:06,999
In somebody that you already knew.

213
00:15:09,587--> 00:15:10,805
Somebody that you maybe have liked.

214
00:15:13,018--> 00:15:14,365
Or better...

215
00:15:15,806--> 00:15:17,417
Imagine like you.

216
00:15:19,208--> 00:15:21,156
When small it was the best of my class.

217
00:15:21,764--> 00:15:22,806
It was not because he/she liked to study.

218
00:15:23,300--> 00:15:26,220
But yes because I knew that to study
it was my best chance of leaving of there.

219
00:15:26,841--> 00:15:29,959
The stork dropped me off at a covered in dust town.

220
00:15:29,959--> 00:15:31,589
He/she didn't have wrong there.

221
00:15:32,287--> 00:15:35,727
Compared with other annoying towns,
we overcame her measured.

222
00:15:38,204--> 00:15:38,995
I had friends.

223
00:15:41,974--> 00:15:43,667
But it felt always alone.

224
00:15:46,519--> 00:15:47,528
Nobody never left.

225
00:15:48,852--> 00:15:50,145
But I would not die here.

226
00:15:50,997--> 00:15:54,405
No matter how much I love him,
he/she didn't want to seem in anything with my father.

227
00:15:55,902--> 00:15:59,363
He seemed always very distant, and sad.

228
00:15:59,601--> 00:16:00,790
The numbers were his/her life.

229
00:16:01,351--> 00:16:04,966
He was an accountant and he/she waited
that I continued his/her business.

230
00:16:06,092--> 00:16:07,392
But I had other plans.

231
00:16:07,979--> 00:16:09,469
My mother was happy
when I completed 8 years.

232
00:16:09,991--> 00:16:11,851
And I announced that he/she wanted to be a detective.

233
00:16:13,161--> 00:16:14,636
It was not like this with my father.

234
00:16:14,956--> 00:16:17,329
He was losing his/her master plan.

235
00:16:18,201--> 00:16:21,491
And that went increasing his/her hate for the
widow Dobkins, she lived to the side.

236
00:16:22,369--> 00:16:26,593
He/she seems strange, but it was for his/her dog,
Alfie, that I turned into detective.

237
00:16:26,906--> 00:16:29,840
The gram and always more green of the other
side of the fence, at least according to Alfie.

238
00:16:32,018--> 00:16:35,328
Therefore always it was in our garden,
and it was my work catch him/it.

239
00:16:38,521--> 00:16:41,443
But I never entered in the garden
of the widow Dobkins.

240
00:16:41,769--> 00:16:42,846
That era a rule of my father.

241
00:16:44,220--> 00:16:45,223
In my eighth I have a birthday...

242
00:16:46,566--> 00:16:47,668
... I broke the rule.

243
00:16:53,803--> 00:16:57,091
I admit that my solitude and obsession
with the detectives' stories...

244
00:16:57,091--> 00:17:01,369
... they had fed fantasies
and I am not sure of all the details.

245
00:17:01,908--> 00:17:03,068
Except one.

246
00:17:07,168--> 00:17:08,261
The widow Dobkins was dead.

247
00:17:16,557--> 00:17:18,994
He/she took one hour ties that medicate him/it arrived.

248
00:17:19,354--> 00:17:22,603
And for that hour,
my 8 year-old mind accelerated.

249
00:17:23,390--> 00:17:27,487
I decided that a crazy man
it had killed the widow Dobkins.

250
00:17:27,868--> 00:17:30,943
Crazy as our town
he/she had never seen.

251
00:17:30,943--> 00:17:33,900
Nobody would be safe,
nor their dear beings.

252
00:17:33,900--> 00:17:35,691
Mainly their dear beings.

253
00:17:35,990--> 00:17:38,713
Of course medicates him/it
he/she said that was suicide.

254
00:17:38,713--> 00:17:40,124
But I never believed.

255
00:17:41,272--> 00:17:43,776
My mind was open
for a new existence.

256
00:17:44,677--> 00:17:47,193
There it began a detective to be born.

257
00:17:48,358--> 00:17:49,740
Detective Fingerling.

258
00:17:55,595--> 00:17:56,473
That and... that and too much.

259
00:17:58,948--> 00:18:00,701
Here this. What this doing?

260
00:18:02,048--> 00:18:03,305
I will clean everything soon.

261
00:18:03,768--> 00:18:04,844
This with the head full of nonsenses?

262
00:18:05,526--> 00:18:06,040
Did he/she read this?

263
00:18:06,918--> 00:18:08,636
Almost everything, and very creative.

264
00:18:09,692--> 00:18:10,999
That Fingerling...

265
00:18:12,601--> 00:18:13,290
Yes, and a good name.

266
00:18:13,783--> 00:18:14,964
Yes? And that impression you had?

267
00:18:15,381--> 00:18:17,838
I was liking,
at least in the beginning.

268
00:18:18,857--> 00:18:19,670
Why in the beginning?

269
00:18:19,964--> 00:18:21,897
Well, the how much you read?

270
00:18:22,441--> 00:18:23,359
Two chapters.

271
00:18:25,210--> 00:18:26,954
Can it move that stairway? Right here.

272
00:18:27,532--> 00:18:31,780
He/she knows that Fingerling reminds me
of my life, and so strange...

273
00:18:33,248--> 00:18:36,791
And as my childhood, my memoirs...

274
00:18:37,346--> 00:18:38,690
Does it pass me the blue paint?

275
00:18:40,805--> 00:18:41,876
Take.

276
00:18:42,263--> 00:18:43,553
Fingerling doesn't seem anything with you.

277
00:18:45,233--> 00:18:46,658
No? He/she looks at this...

278
00:18:47,462--> 00:18:50,354
"Fingerling in the Zoo",
my mother read for me when child.

279
00:18:50,856--> 00:18:52,476
With certainty a lot of people he/she read
when he/she was child.

280
00:18:52,982--> 00:18:53,694
Did you read?

281
00:18:53,917--> 00:18:54,757
- No.
- Daaaaaaa...

282
00:18:55,923--> 00:18:57,306
But every time that I read a book,

283
00:18:57,666--> 00:19:01,142
and as if the author stole me
something that only I knew.

284
00:19:01,987--> 00:19:03,958
Some day I will write something
and that had happened with other.

285
00:19:04,777--> 00:19:07,368
I don't know wanted, and really eccentric.

286
00:19:08,819--> 00:19:12,402
Many neighborhoods exist with houses
as yours.

287
00:19:13,276--> 00:19:14,808
With streets as yours.

288
00:19:15,104--> 00:19:16,175
Yes, and with dogs to the side?

289
00:19:17,601--> 00:19:19,238
His/her neighbor had a dog, that unusual.

290
00:19:20,814--> 00:19:23,233
He/she didn't call himself Alfie, he/she calls himself Genius,
"Bad-tempered", my father called him/it.

291
00:19:24,769--> 00:19:27,798
He/she always escaped, for that
I work in the Control of Animals.

292
00:19:28,313--> 00:19:29,311
Fingerling and a detective.

293
00:19:30,262--> 00:19:32,134
I collected detectives' magazines.

294
00:19:32,607--> 00:19:35,315
The widow to the side? You Dobkins?

295
00:19:36,454--> 00:19:37,385
And as my mother.

296
00:19:39,380--> 00:19:40,988
He/she died in the day that completed 8 years.

297
00:19:42,126--> 00:19:44,370
He/she looks, he/she gets tied up ruffled...

298
00:19:44,951--> 00:19:46,224
Dear, continue reading.

299
00:19:47,672--> 00:19:50,435
Therefore descubrira that Fingerling doesn't have
anything similar to you.

300
00:19:50,776--> 00:19:51,850
Somebody wrote a book
on the dad?

301
00:19:52,464--> 00:19:52,901
- No.
- Yes.

302
00:19:53,977--> 00:19:54,802
Yes.

303
00:19:55,153--> 00:19:56,487
- How was the school?
- Horrible.

304
00:19:59,198--> 00:19:59,816
Am I in him?

305
00:20:00,860--> 00:20:03,786
If and on the dad,
I should have a spectacular paper.

306
00:20:04,531--> 00:20:07,564
Yes, you would owe, but you don't have.
Is it there, what do you think that means?

307
00:20:10,320--> 00:20:10,974
Gee.

308
00:20:11,627--> 00:20:12,906
- Who and that?
- Fabrizia.

309
00:20:13,547--> 00:20:14,652
Fabrizia.

310
00:22:14,207--> 00:22:15,921
Chapter 5

311
00:22:17,535--> 00:22:19,287
I know the blond suicide.

312
00:22:53,308--> 00:22:55,267
They informed me of the neighbors' surveillance.

313
00:22:55,543--> 00:22:59,475
I know that he/she wants to do some thing,
but it had not worked.

314
00:23:01,600--> 00:23:03,188
Arrive close and I kill myself.

315
00:23:06,339--> 00:23:09,590
I hope not,
today and mine has a birthday.

316
00:23:09,590--> 00:23:12,249
If you do that,
he/she will end up being the worst of all of the times.

317
00:23:13,910--> 00:23:14,939
You and pathetic.

318
00:23:17,124--> 00:23:18,430
I am making that of truth...

319
00:23:18,430--> 00:23:20,903
To hang and a painful thing.

320
00:23:22,767--> 00:23:27,119
Most that it is hung,
he/she puts an end to a permanent necklace.

321
00:23:30,024--> 00:23:32,497
A memory finds strange of
how miserable they are.

322
00:23:35,130--> 00:23:36,568
He/she goes, we will talk...

323
00:23:38,332--> 00:23:41,294
If it it continues depressed, I put you
a candy among the eyes.

324
00:23:45,085--> 00:23:46,789
I have good aim.

325
00:23:51,579--> 00:23:52,758
Is it true that and does yours have a birthday?

326
00:24:04,414--> 00:24:08,569
The blond suicide, told me that was already
a good person, but now...

327
00:24:09,458--> 00:24:10,883
... I am a bad person.

328
00:24:12,076--> 00:24:13,463
He/she didn't want to leave you angry.

329
00:24:15,499--> 00:24:17,032
You don't have that power.

330
00:24:19,575--> 00:24:21,249
You should see my former-boyfriend
I will show you.

331
00:24:22,033--> 00:24:25,095
And I was quiet for one moment.

332
00:24:26,113--> 00:24:27,616
But then she said:

333
00:24:27,918--> 00:24:30,857
- And this number, that cursed number.

334
00:24:33,602--> 00:24:34,688
23.
He dominates my world.

335
00:24:34,919--> 00:24:38,318
And my father's fault, he said that
it found a way of winning the number

336
00:24:39,355--> 00:24:42,052
That he had won,
that I was safe.

337
00:24:43,567--> 00:24:45,392
He/she said: dad you love.

338
00:24:45,694--> 00:24:48,963
He will make something to guarantee
that you don't inherit the curse.

339
00:24:55,088--> 00:24:55,895
He was wrong.

340
00:24:57,500--> 00:25:00,169
His/her warranty if it returned with
the blood with that I write.

341
00:25:06,056--> 00:25:08,363
I believe that dad didn't like me enough.

342
00:25:11,578--> 00:25:12,778
This everywhere.

343
00:25:15,161--> 00:25:18,560
Plates, you paginate of books,
it ties in the lights of the elevators.

344
00:25:18,560--> 00:25:21,155
This in my name and in the
words that I say.

345
00:25:22,123--> 00:25:25,150
Anything, anything and safe.

346
00:25:25,589--> 00:25:27,897
Because my favorite and pink color.
Do you know him/it what rose and?

347
00:25:32,085--> 00:25:33,006
Red 27.

348
00:25:33,262--> 00:25:34,200
White 65.

349
00:25:34,200--> 00:25:35,190
65 + 27 = 92

350
00:25:35,537--> 00:25:37,377
Rose has 4 letters, 92 divide for 4.

351
00:25:39,235--> 00:25:40,605
The porra of the 23!

352
00:25:42,836--> 00:25:45,108
For being sincere, I didn't understand anything.

353
00:25:46,944--> 00:25:48,028
I asked the only question
that I remembered.

354
00:25:49,558--> 00:25:50,195
Does he/she have more coffee?

355
00:25:51,549--> 00:25:52,291
<i> THE STAIRWAYS FOR THE SKY </i>

356
00:25:52,291--> 00:25:54,082
It was important that she continued speaking.

357
00:25:55,339--> 00:25:56,883
I told like this him/her a story.

358
00:25:57,411--> 00:25:59,345
I had an uncle that called her Charlie.

359
00:26:02,565--> 00:26:06,156
His/her horoscope said that he/she would fall in love
for a dressed woman of red.

360
00:26:08,813--> 00:26:12,881
Like this he left, it sought everyday
for a, it ties that he/she found.

361
00:26:14,027--> 00:26:15,406
Six months later, were married.

362
00:26:15,644--> 00:26:16,077
Lie.

363
00:26:20,591--> 00:26:25,673
Two years later the red wife got divorced
of my uncle. Everything diffused and it left.

364
00:26:27,898--> 00:26:28,836
Him this outside...

365
00:26:31,031--> 00:26:31,848
... at this time...

366
00:26:35,832--> 00:26:37,752
... it still looks for the dressed woman of red.

367
00:26:40,185--> 00:26:41,503
He/she believes that he/she found the wrong.

368
00:26:43,329--> 00:26:45,018
Was that for doing to feel better?

369
00:26:46,353--> 00:26:48,019
You seem smarter than my uncle Charlie.

370
00:26:52,147--> 00:26:53,915
She had a face done to smile.

371
00:26:55,715--> 00:26:58,280
And while I leave the building, it thought
I had one more work than it was well done.

372
00:27:26,387--> 00:27:29,604
The following day I sought the former-boyfriend
that the blond suicide mentioned.

373
00:27:30,547--> 00:27:33,033
To burn glasses of coffee
and an old trick policeman.

374
00:27:33,033--> 00:27:35,775
To eliminate the smell of the death in the scene of the crime.

375
00:27:35,775--> 00:27:38,243
But somebody had consumed
the whole coffee.

376
00:27:53,827--> 00:27:56,366
When I counted Fabrizia
on the suicidal loiria...

377
00:27:57,041--> 00:27:58,499
She asked me that took her/it to his/her apartment.

378
00:28:00,385--> 00:28:02,288
His/her reaction was Fabrizia purely.

379
00:28:04,072--> 00:28:05,302
Death and sex.

380
00:28:07,221--> 00:28:07,947
That aphrodisiac.

381
00:28:08,577--> 00:28:10,505
While you paginate them if they loosened of the walls...

382
00:28:10,734--> 00:28:13,740
... the reach of the obsession of the
blond suicide if it turned clear.

383
00:28:15,371--> 00:28:17,862
She had reduced everything to 23.

384
00:28:18,090--> 00:28:20,202
<i> This everywhere, dates, hours.</i>

385
00:28:21,058--> 00:28:24,835
<i> Plates, you paginate of books,
it ties in the lights of the elevators.</i>

386
00:28:24,835--> 00:28:27,530
<i> This in my name.
And in the words that I speak.</i>

387
00:28:28,086--> 00:28:29,049
<i> This in my name.</i>

388
00:28:29,590--> 00:28:31,164
<i> This in my name.
And in the words that I speak.</i>

389
00:28:34,775--> 00:28:38,446
When I discovered his/her name,
that was also fit in in the sum.

390
00:28:39,798--> 00:28:41,582
Maybe it only went a coincidence. I want to say...

391
00:28:41,932--> 00:28:46,985
... a name and only a name, and
a number and only a number.

392
00:28:48,428--> 00:28:49,384
No and?

393
00:29:09,791--> 00:29:12,572
Printed by him same, edited by him same...

394
00:29:13,948--> 00:29:15,600
... it is an author that I never heard to speak.

395
00:29:22,491--> 00:29:26,603
He/she seems that this Topsy no
he/she wrote anything nor before nor later.

396
00:29:34,473--> 00:29:35,710
Walter, that this doing?

397
00:29:36,759--> 00:29:37,373
He/she looks at this.

398
00:29:39,742--> 00:29:43,370
Walter Sparrow doesn't work,
but if I use my second name...

399
00:29:43,907--> 00:29:44,571
Walter.

400
00:29:44,571--> 00:29:46,467
5, 1, 1, 9, 7.
No and incredible?

401
00:29:47,453--> 00:29:47,956
What?

402
00:29:49,398--> 00:29:50,434
Everything and 23.

403
00:29:51,009--> 00:29:53,852
Mine has a birthday, driver's license,
number of safe social, everything.

404
00:29:55,573--> 00:29:58,077
I was born 11:12 in the night,
11 more 12

405
00:29:58,559--> 00:30:00,754
And as if he/she was imitating my life.

406
00:30:02,691--> 00:30:03,583
You cannot be speaking serialize.

407
00:30:04,012--> 00:30:06,935
The author knows a lot about me,
I feel that he/she chose me.

408
00:30:07,402--> 00:30:10,245
Did he/she do that all the day?
Did he/she finish the book?

409
00:30:10,245--> 00:30:10,859
Not yet.

410
00:30:11,595--> 00:30:14,934
He/she concentrates on small nuances and
you arrive crazy conclus.es.

411
00:30:15,230--> 00:30:18,760
And the fact that Fingerling sees a murderer? How many did you kill?

412
00:30:20,158--> 00:30:21,535
Wait.
Who does he kill?

413
00:30:22,625--> 00:30:23,521
He/she asks the Mr. Fingerling.

414
00:30:24,215--> 00:30:25,326
Pardon love.

415
00:30:30,090--> 00:30:31,091
Why this color?

416
00:30:31,465--> 00:30:33,341
Why did choose this color?

417
00:30:34,307--> 00:30:35,223
I don't know, you tell me.

418
00:30:36,630--> 00:30:40,303
<i> Red number 5. R, and, d and 27
(red in English). Plus 5 and 32, that and...</i>

419
00:30:41,586--> 00:30:42,673
This exaggerating.

420
00:30:43,103--> 00:30:43,932
Of course exists differences.

421
00:30:44,263--> 00:30:46,609
Fingerling and a detective,
I catch dogs.

422
00:30:46,609--> 00:30:51,415
- He met Fabrizia when he/she had 32, I met you with...
- 23

423
00:30:51,921--> 00:30:53,471
And that day we met each other?

424
00:30:53,471--> 00:30:54,621
September 14.

425
00:30:54,621--> 00:30:57,247
And 14 more 9 and?

426
00:30:57,469--> 00:30:58,343
23.

427
00:31:01,189--> 00:31:05,476
We got married on October 13,
13 more 10, 23.

428
00:31:05,476--> 00:31:08,930
He/she dominated the world of the blond suicide, it killed himself for that.

429
00:31:09,162--> 00:31:12,179
He/she surrendered Fingerling in the day that did 32: 23 to the I contradict.

430
00:31:12,926--> 00:31:15,881
<i> Fingerling said that was destiny (fate). Does he/she know his/her value númerico? 32!</i>

431
00:31:18,293--> 00:31:19,853
"I contain my case, meritíssimo."

432
00:31:21,381--> 00:31:23,835
I think this taking everything serializes her too much.

433
00:31:23,835--> 00:31:25,336
We lived in the 1814.

434
00:31:25,980--> 00:31:28,399
I say that 18 and more than 8 and it is equal to 9.

435
00:31:28,819--> 00:31:30,809
And 9 more 14 and equal to 23.

436
00:31:31,680--> 00:31:33,815
14 and 1 more 4 that of the 5.

437
00:31:34,035--> 00:31:37,225
- And 5 + 18 also and 23!
- My God!

438
00:31:37,577--> 00:31:38,844
Ok Robin, don't begin with that joke.

439
00:31:39,691--> 00:31:40,649
Nobody this of joke.

440
00:31:41,249--> 00:31:43,696
I say that 5 more 18 and 23.

441
00:31:43,908--> 00:31:46,399
Because if the book went 27 or 150, he/she could make the same.

442
00:31:48,447--> 00:31:49,822
18 + 14 and 32.

443
00:31:52,674--> 00:31:53,750
23 to the I contradict.

444
00:31:54,846--> 00:31:55,960
Frightening, hein?

445
00:31:59,471--> 00:32:00,259
Chapter 7.

446
00:32:01,167--> 00:32:04,113
The suicidal loiria provokes in Fabrizia an enthusiasm of new emoc.es.

447
00:32:05,262--> 00:32:08,951
I followed the life, but everything that I got to think was in a number.

448
00:32:11,596--> 00:32:12,111
Thank you.

449
00:32:12,861--> 00:32:16,161
Didn't he/she tell you that the clock behind the table indicated 9:14?

450
00:32:23,573--> 00:32:25,241
Fake that he/she has a knife. Fake that he/she has a knife.

451
00:32:36,737--> 00:32:37,640
I know that will be sorry.

452
00:32:39,434--> 00:32:41,092
He/she shuts up, furious!

453
00:32:42,713--> 00:32:43,782
Or you die.

454
00:32:43,782--> 00:32:45,334
Of course I would never hurt truth Fabrizia.

455
00:32:46,308--> 00:32:47,264
I loved her.

456
00:32:48,528--> 00:32:50,070
And it thought she loved me.

457
00:33:09,322--> 00:33:12,952
But I began to have horrible nightmares.

458
00:34:05,151--> 00:34:08,689
8. 9. 10, 11, 12, 13...

459
00:34:10,127--> 00:34:11,123
What this doing?

460
00:34:13,220--> 00:34:14,124
I am reading.

461
00:34:15,756--> 00:34:16,465
This crazy one?

462
00:34:24,377--> 00:34:25,812
FEBRUARY 6

463
00:35:14,189--> 00:35:14,740
Isaac?

464
00:35:16,081--> 00:35:20,246
In practical terms, and a box that accumulates organic energy.

465
00:35:21,967--> 00:35:24,429
We will speak about WIlbelm Reich
next week, thank you.

466
00:35:26,396--> 00:35:27,706
He/she seems a fascinating book.

467
00:35:28,307--> 00:35:30,742
They exist many few books
in that the protagonist plays Saxophone.

468
00:35:33,997--> 00:35:35,479
He/she didn't know that he/she played.

469
00:35:35,479--> 00:35:37,838
I don't play. No and that that matters...

470
00:35:38,296--> 00:35:40,068
And the number, I see him/it everywhere.

471
00:35:40,792--> 00:35:43,325
An aficcionado for a conspiracy...

472
00:35:44,214--> 00:35:49,128
For all, the world has a Ray of 23 degrees, when I say that 23,5 say that 5 and only 2 + 3.

473
00:35:54,622--> 00:35:57,215
23 and very good for this
I play in matter.

474
00:35:57,921--> 00:35:58,532
Game?

475
00:35:59,045--> 00:35:59,981
Yes! Paranoia.

476
00:36:02,986--> 00:36:04,960
A lot of literature exists on the Enigma of the 23.

477
00:36:04,960--> 00:36:05,967
Do exist?

478
00:36:07,054--> 00:36:09,019
23 axioms exist in the
geometry of Euclides.

479
00:36:10,051--> 00:36:15,051
The human body possesses 46 chromosomes,
23 of the father and 23 of the mother.

480
00:36:16,377--> 00:36:19,171
The blood takes 23 seconds to circulate.

481
00:36:19,459--> 00:36:22,424
The Mayan believed that the end of the world would happen
on December 23, 2012.

482
00:36:24,804--> 00:36:34,186
- 20 + 12 and?
- 23 to the I contradict. Or 20 + 1 + 2. Then, which and this... What and 23?

483
00:36:39,072--> 00:36:40,608
God...

484
00:36:41,408--> 00:36:42,597
2 divided by 3.

485
00:36:43,043--> 00:36:44,122
0,666.

486
00:36:45,240--> 00:36:46,489
666. The number of the devil.

487
00:36:49,632--> 00:36:51,956
Only 22 chapters exist in Apocalypse.

488
00:36:52,484--> 00:36:54,775
And all know as that finishes.

489
00:36:55,570--> 00:36:57,769
23 no and a gift, and a curse.

490
00:36:57,769--> 00:36:59,406
The truth and that a very select group of people exists...

491
00:37:01,232--> 00:37:03,381
... that he/she is delighted in perpetuating the infamy of a number.

492
00:37:03,805--> 00:37:04,746
The 7 of the luck.

493
00:37:05,193--> 00:37:06,407
The 13 of the bad luck.

494
00:37:06,939--> 00:37:08,485
The shoes of an old player's luck.

495
00:37:08,485--> 00:37:10,382
There are people that only prays because he/she believes that God angers to help.

496
00:37:12,696--> 00:37:15,530
That and a magic thought, without rational scientific.

497
00:37:17,579--> 00:37:19,765
Now that it seeks the 23, you always anger finds him/it.

498
00:37:21,467--> 00:37:24,623
Agatha thinks am crazy.

499
00:37:25,347--> 00:37:27,194
Finish the book.

500
00:37:28,608--> 00:37:32,575
If after reading everything still to believe
that the subject and you...

501
00:37:32,575--> 00:37:36,433
... the author knows you well and he will only be able to answer you.

502
00:37:36,820--> 00:37:37,780
And a good idea.

503
00:37:37,780--> 00:37:39,875
Meanwhile, I can speak to Agatha if he/she wants.

504
00:37:51,691--> 00:37:54,550
All of the nights it killed Fabrizia in my dreams.

505
00:37:56,190--> 00:37:58,804
I explained to the psychiatrist the sum of his/her name.

506
00:38:00,519--> 00:38:02,099
23. What does think that means?

507
00:38:02,660--> 00:38:03,561
I don't know, Miles.

508
00:38:07,516--> 00:38:09,220
Who knows should be a damned accountant.

509
00:38:10,738--> 00:38:13,733
The Dr. Phoenix recommends hurt me.

510
00:38:14,388--> 00:38:15,507
He/she should leave of you hurt.

511
00:38:16,127--> 00:38:17,441
As if the time got well.

512
00:38:18,067--> 00:38:19,418
The time and a gentile man.

513
00:38:20,826--> 00:38:22,636
The time and only a murderous system...

514
00:38:23,332--> 00:38:25,359
... with numbers with a composed meaning arrested to him.

515
00:38:25,359--> 00:38:27,867
In any way, I also prescribe myself some you hurt.

516
00:38:29,540--> 00:38:30,473
Emotional license.

517
00:38:32,757--> 00:38:34,058
Then no and one more detective.

518
00:38:35,637--> 00:38:37,316
Fabrizia no longer it was impressed.

519
00:38:38,252--> 00:38:40,091
I am a detective of you hurt.

520
00:38:44,684--> 00:38:45,856
Then you don't have a weapon.

521
00:38:48,513--> 00:38:49,677
I still have these.

522
00:38:50,414--> 00:38:52,175
Maybe should sleep this night.

523
00:39:06,959--> 00:39:08,137
The number was for all sides.

524
00:39:09,623--> 00:39:12,182
At this time I don't need to say how many equal of shoes she had.

525
00:39:26,777--> 00:39:30,007
What are these shoes making in the garbage can?

526
00:39:32,298--> 00:39:33,807
Did he/she know that you had 23 equal?

527
00:39:37,216--> 00:39:39,153
You this crazy one.

528
00:39:39,860--> 00:39:42,530
They threw the bomb in Hiroshima the 8:15.

529
00:39:43,935--> 00:39:44,497
8 + 15 = 23

530
00:39:46,353--> 00:39:51,388
Explos.es in Waco, Texas and in Oklahoma City they were on April 19.

531
00:39:51,609--> 00:39:52,557
4 + 19 = 23.

532
00:39:53,694--> 00:39:57,813
The Tropic of Cancer: 23,5 degrees north. Capricorn: 23,5 degrees south.

533
00:39:59,306--> 00:40:01,686
10886 and the number...

534
00:40:01,686--> 00:40:03,868
... that Al Capone used in his/her uniform of the prison.

535
00:40:06,057--> 00:40:08,554
They executed Ted Bundy on January 23.

536
00:40:14,312--> 00:40:15,170
Everything and 23.

537
00:40:17,580--> 00:40:18,471
She didn't understand.

538
00:40:20,045--> 00:40:22,440
What was not problem, since I didn't also understand.

539
00:40:23,926--> 00:40:28,088
He/she only knew that the number had followed the blond suicide.

540
00:40:28,676--> 00:40:29,911
Isabel Lydia Hunt.

541
00:40:34,804--> 00:40:36,218
Now it came behind me...

542
00:40:38,400--> 00:40:39,813
Can I speak to Fabrizia, if he/she wants?

543
00:40:43,840--> 00:40:45,884
I believe that he/she said him/it at this time with a certain innocence.

544
00:41:08,331--> 00:41:09,420
But thinking well.

545
00:41:10,796--> 00:41:12,061
Can I speak to Fabrizia, if he/she wants?

546
00:41:12,798--> 00:41:14,031
He/she wanted to have reacted different.

547
00:41:45,292--> 00:41:46,710
He/she should have given me bill of the truth.

548
00:41:48,116--> 00:41:49,276
I know that and absurdity.

549
00:41:50,524--> 00:41:52,649
But it ties the color of the tie betrays him.

550
00:41:59,400--> 00:42:00,447
Do you know him/it what and the pink color?

551
00:42:01,063--> 00:42:04,360
Red: 27, white: 65. 65 + 27 and 92.

552
00:42:05,318--> 00:42:06,434
Rose has 4 letters,
92 divided by 4.

553
00:42:07,513--> 00:42:08,480
23, caralho!

554
00:42:11,172--> 00:42:14,722
Meanwhile he/she could speak to Agatha, if he/she wants?

555
00:42:16,106--> 00:42:16,676
Paranoia.

556
00:42:17,012--> 00:42:18,703
23 and very good for this
I play in matter.

557
00:42:19,298--> 00:42:20,093
Paranoia.

558
00:42:21,014--> 00:42:21,907
Can I speak to Agatha?

559
00:42:22,702--> 00:42:23,342
2 divided by 3.

560
00:42:23,626--> 00:42:24,600
And 0,666.

561
00:42:26,278--> 00:42:29,556
When they say that and 23,5 and they say that 5 and 2 + 3.

562
00:42:30,518--> 00:42:31,750
You seek the 23.

563
00:42:34,107--> 00:42:34,947
CLOSED

564
00:42:53,765--> 00:42:56,997
Meanwhile he/she could speak to Agatha, if he/she wants?

565
00:43:10,001--> 00:43:10,848
Chapter 21

566
00:44:36,801--> 00:44:37,842
Oh, my God.

567
00:44:41,487--> 00:44:42,532
.Ag?

568
00:44:44,372--> 00:44:45,640
My God, My God.

569
00:44:52,538--> 00:44:54,870
And a nightmare. And a nightmare. And a nightmare.

570
00:44:56,118--> 00:44:57,459
Everything will be well.

571
00:46:01,174--> 00:46:01,696
Ag.

572
00:46:03,194--> 00:46:04,571
I don't want him to worry.

573
00:46:06,134--> 00:46:07,807
I only need one night to clear my head.

574
00:46:10,783--> 00:46:11,713
Please don't give up of me.

575
00:46:13,128--> 00:46:14,922
His/her husband that loves you and he/she catches dogs, Walter.

576
00:46:35,376--> 00:46:35,970
Why this street?

577
00:46:37,277--> 00:46:38,024
Why this hotel?

578
00:46:40,739--> 00:46:41,785
How was I selected?

579
00:47:05,901--> 00:47:06,979
Good morning.

580
00:47:07,873--> 00:47:08,879
In what I can help?

581
00:47:09,359--> 00:47:10,778
Well, I want...

582
00:47:13,064--> 00:47:14,022
... a room.

583
00:47:14,606--> 00:47:15,200
Sign the registration.

584
00:47:22,155--> 00:47:23,506
The 27 and the most silent.

585
00:47:26,098--> 00:47:26,867
And the 23?

586
00:47:28,418--> 00:47:31,494
We have been having plumbing problems with the 23.

587
00:48:03,255--> 00:48:04,583
Chapter 22.

588
00:48:05,485--> 00:48:06,420
He/she happened what I feared.

589
00:49:16,673--> 00:49:17,792
Playing damned games.

590
00:49:24,317--> 00:49:26,277
Plus 4 and 48, more 50.

591
00:49:26,828--> 00:49:27,943
Tropic of Capricorn.

592
00:49:51,840--> 00:49:53,591
It was not a very happy end.

593
00:49:54,915--> 00:49:55,770
It was not an end at all.

594
00:49:56,551--> 00:50:00,081
After the Chapter 22, there was not anything else haul of the question:

595
00:50:01,912--> 00:50:04,182
Did the number live for killing another day?

596
00:50:04,886--> 00:50:06,837
Was the number behind Fingerling?

597
00:50:08,627--> 00:50:10,267
It is now vineyard behind me.

598
00:50:16,855--> 00:50:17,574
You?

599
00:50:20,072--> 00:50:20,892
And everything his/her fault.

600
00:50:21,860--> 00:50:23,322
If he/she didn't have me late.

601
00:50:53,441--> 00:50:56,304
A place to rest in peace.

602
00:50:58,099--> 00:50:58,883
Yes.

603
00:51:04,347--> 00:51:06,456
I caught you, son of the prostitute.

604
00:51:07,199--> 00:51:11,612
He/she calms, he/she had wakened up in some hours just with a headache.

605
00:51:15,183--> 00:51:16,448
Now no this so ferocious one.

606
00:51:16,814--> 00:51:18,056
Filthy and evil dog.

607
00:51:22,914--> 00:51:25,034
L, M, N, 14.

608
00:51:25,516--> 00:51:27,482
THE, B, C, D, E.

609
00:51:32,581--> 00:51:33,427
Shit.

610
00:51:37,194--> 00:51:39,053
Ned, Ned.

611
00:51:39,987--> 00:51:42,866
I am priest Sebastian, I suppose that that has an explanation.

612
00:51:43,387--> 00:51:46,735
This sleeping. I work for the
Control of Animals. And his/her dog?

613
00:51:47,332--> 00:51:49,195
And of Barnaby, my gardener.

614
00:51:49,689--> 00:51:51,835
Don't worry Barnaby, he had been well, only this sleeping.

615
00:51:58,502--> 00:51:59,388
Why did call him/it of Ned?

616
00:51:59,909--> 00:52:03,869
I didn't go I, was lost and I adopted him/it, he likes cemeteries.

617
00:52:03,869--> 00:52:06,724
He/she sits down and it observes them cut as if it was protecting them.

618
00:52:09,543--> 00:52:12,225
I invented like this his/her nickname, "Guardian of the Deads."

619
00:52:13,135--> 00:52:14,185
Lately and this.

620
00:52:16,038--> 00:52:17,404
Been born on February 10, 1968.

621
00:52:18,274--> 00:52:19,476
Died on February 10, 1991.

622
00:52:20,296--> 00:52:21,266
No and possible.

623
00:52:23,572--> 00:52:24,410
What does happen he/she, son?

624
00:52:25,980--> 00:52:27,743
He/she died in the day that completed 23 years.

625
00:52:28,719--> 00:52:29,661
We can suppose like this.

626
00:52:30,331--> 00:52:31,125
What?

627
00:52:31,688--> 00:52:32,506
That he/she died.

628
00:52:33,609--> 00:52:36,039
They never found the body, and only one cuts.

629
00:52:37,212--> 00:52:39,336
- Where was it?
- In the library. No and a simple book.

630
00:52:39,775--> 00:52:43,301
It is true, the number leaves you crazy, he/she makes to do you things.

631
00:52:46,152--> 00:52:46,942
Terrible things.

632
00:52:48,062--> 00:52:49,109
And better I to go.

633
00:52:50,485--> 00:52:52,553
No, I want him to see this. All you.

634
00:52:53,836--> 00:52:56,782
They murdered a called university student Laura Tollins.

635
00:52:57,594--> 00:53:00,873
They never found his/her body, but his/her bed was full of blood.

636
00:53:02,994--> 00:53:04,786
This man killed her, Kyle Flinch.

637
00:53:05,458--> 00:53:09,564
They found his/her weapon, a butcher knife, with their digital impress.es.

638
00:53:10,123--> 00:53:11,781
Walter, that was to 15 years.

639
00:53:12,301--> 00:53:15,892
Ag, was not just his/her teacher
of psychology, they were lovers.

640
00:53:16,486--> 00:53:20,881
Everything that you/they did together - sexually -
it was as the characters of the book.

641
00:53:21,762--> 00:53:24,008
He said that the knife was her idea.

642
00:53:24,342--> 00:53:25,620
She wanted to fake an attack.

643
00:53:27,982--> 00:53:28,984
Kyle Flich.

644
00:53:29,467--> 00:53:30,922
And Topsy Kretts.

645
00:53:32,186--> 00:53:33,527
The book and yours.

646
00:53:35,035--> 00:53:36,649
Disturbed literary confession.

647
00:53:40,217--> 00:53:42,217
Agatha said that a dog told you this.

648
00:53:44,077--> 00:53:47,354
Ned, no and any dog, and the Guardian of the Deads.

649
00:53:49,110--> 00:53:52,565
What does happen with all these 23?
And his/her name, and the one of the other ones?

650
00:53:53,161--> 00:53:53,686
And everything a coincidence?

651
00:53:54,167--> 00:53:54,990
I don't know.

652
00:53:56,887--> 00:53:58,304
But I know who can tell me.

653
00:54:01,830--> 00:54:02,878
FEBRUARY 8

654
00:54:16,460--> 00:54:18,654
He/she arrived 2 days before.

655
00:54:22,024--> 00:54:23,259
You knew that I would come.

656
00:54:28,288--> 00:54:29,953
The reporters always come on the 10.

657
00:54:30,363--> 00:54:31,737
The day in that killed Laura Tollins.

658
00:54:32,073--> 00:54:35,091
The day that you/they removed her/it of me.

659
00:54:35,659--> 00:54:37,859
I am not a reporter, my name is Walter Sparrow.

660
00:54:38,231--> 00:54:40,844
I was born on February 3.

661
00:54:42,554--> 00:54:44,903
Late congratulations...

662
00:54:46,215--> 00:54:48,033
In February 3, 2-3.

663
00:54:49,747--> 00:54:50,303
Yes.

664
00:54:51,381--> 00:54:52,949
Don't fake that he/she doesn't understand, Topsy Kretts.

665
00:54:53,807--> 00:54:55,145
I Read his/her book.

666
00:54:56,111--> 00:54:57,532
Speak to me about the number.

667
00:54:57,866--> 00:54:59,430
And for that what did he kill her?

668
00:55:00,433--> 00:55:02,335
I need to know, you have to tell me.

669
00:55:07,849--> 00:55:08,708
What does he/she/you happen you?

670
00:55:09,121--> 00:55:10,653
I fear that is passing for me.

671
00:55:11,323--> 00:55:12,458
What me acontence?

672
00:55:18,580--> 00:55:20,730
Does he/she want to know the worst of being in the prison?

673
00:55:22,273--> 00:55:26,301
His/her family, his/her sister, their parents, all come to visit you.

674
00:55:27,864--> 00:55:31,642
With the time, they stop coming, and his/her sister stops coming entirely.

675
00:55:33,676--> 00:55:36,351
Therefore he/she notices that his/her mother doesn't look at you more in the eyes.

676
00:55:37,876--> 00:55:39,985
Therefore she had also stopped coming.

677
00:55:41,174--> 00:55:45,691
Finally his/her father says that his/her sister had a nervous collapse.

678
00:55:47,481--> 00:55:50,626
He/she didn't get to work with the fact of having a murderous brother.

679
00:55:51,240--> 00:55:55,561
He/she has tears in the eyes when it tells you that, but no this sad one.

680
00:55:58,435--> 00:55:59,355
This with rage.

681
00:56:00,925--> 00:56:02,471
That and the last time that he/she sees him/it.

682
00:56:06,273--> 00:56:07,916
I didn't kill Laura.

683
00:56:09,262--> 00:56:10,531
I loved her.

684
00:56:11,352--> 00:56:13,512
And I didn't write a book on a number.

685
00:56:17,525--> 00:56:18,256
You this lying.

686
00:56:19,804--> 00:56:22,746
I am arrested by a crime that I didn't commit, Mr. Sparrow.

687
00:56:26,287--> 00:56:28,469
But I believe that their problems are worse than mine.

688
00:56:32,921--> 00:56:34,318
You and a damned liar.

689
00:56:37,369--> 00:56:38,337
- No.
- Yes.

690
00:56:38,672--> 00:56:39,587
No.

691
00:56:43,528--> 00:56:44,458
If I had writing a book.

692
00:56:45,181--> 00:56:48,016
It would not use a ridiculous name like Topsy Kretts.

693
00:57:04,095--> 00:57:06,102
A Story of Obsession, by Topay Kretts.

694
00:57:12,987--> 00:57:14,639
It was very convincing on his/her innocence.

695
00:57:15,072--> 00:57:16,490
Well, murderers usually the healthy.

696
00:57:16,774--> 00:57:21,717
Their impress.es were in the knife,
her blood in his/her hand when he called for Police.

697
00:57:23,977--> 00:57:25,581
And innocent.

698
00:57:28,080--> 00:57:29,892
Why doesn't his/her name add 23?

699
00:57:30,336--> 00:57:32,870
The true murderer, the author, this loosens, I have that you find him/it.

700
00:57:35,507--> 00:57:36,989
Wait, I know how it can find him/it.

701
00:57:44,688--> 00:57:46,873
Yesterday the night, when he/she was reading the book.

702
00:57:47,971--> 00:57:49,388
I found the number of a Post office box in the end.

703
00:57:58,451--> 00:58:00,444
- Doesn't nothing want inside?
- Only the stuffing.

704
00:58:00,836--> 00:58:03,521
- When does he/she want that arrives?
- Tomorrow of guile.

705
00:58:04,175--> 00:58:06,010
- He/she will have to Be expressed.
- Everything well.

706
00:58:06,696--> 00:58:07,591
That and everything?

707
00:58:08,071--> 00:58:10,085
No... No... We want...

708
00:58:10,679--> 00:58:12,284
We want 23 of them.

709
00:58:17,086--> 00:58:19,434
I dreamed that I killed you, Ag.

710
00:58:20,436--> 00:58:22,027
Fingerling had the same dream on Fa...

711
00:58:23,717--> 00:58:25,275
I am going with you today.

712
00:58:26,465--> 00:58:28,738
And everything this will finish.

713
00:58:31,207--> 00:58:32,655
You would not hurt me, Walter.

714
00:58:35,556--> 00:58:37,562
He/she would not hurt anybody, never.

715
00:58:42,433--> 00:58:44,035
How does he/she know?

716
00:58:48,217--> 00:58:50,525
FEBRUARY 9

717
00:58:53,130--> 00:58:54,221
Here they are their boxes, garotao.

718
00:58:56,305--> 00:58:57,575
Now we will see if somebody appears.

719
00:58:59,997--> 00:59:02,592
It can be that is not the author, maybe nor be a name.

720
00:59:03,561--> 00:59:04,491
Well.

721
00:59:04,491--> 00:59:05,959
We will know soon.

722
00:59:31,065--> 00:59:32,250
- Walter, looks.
- What?

723
00:59:32,628--> 00:59:33,387
Somebody entered.

724
00:59:36,974--> 00:59:37,980
And he, has to be.

725
00:59:39,184--> 00:59:39,926
Do you find?

726
00:59:40,602--> 00:59:43,061
He/she looks for him, he/she has to be him.

727
00:59:51,665--> 00:59:52,713
He/she finished the game, Topsy Kretts.

728
01:00:04,928--> 01:00:07,424
You should be dead.

729
01:00:08,646--> 01:00:10,064
You should be dead.

730
01:00:14,022--> 01:00:14,901
I will call the Police.

731
01:00:15,460--> 01:00:16,376
Stop, unfortunate, stop!

732
01:00:16,890--> 01:00:17,671
Who and you?

733
01:00:18,680--> 01:00:20,310
What does the number, mean?

734
01:00:21,335--> 01:00:22,560
I think you know.

735
01:00:27,079--> 01:00:27,988
Oh my God, an ambulance.

736
01:00:28,991--> 01:00:30,000
God of the sky.

737
01:00:30,000--> 01:00:31,169
He/she calls an ambulance, by God.

738
01:00:33,435--> 01:00:35,854
Don't dare to die.
Does he/she listen to me? Don't die.

739
01:00:36,301--> 01:00:37,386
Walter, please.

740
01:00:38,069--> 01:00:40,458
Only he can help us
to return to the normal.

741
01:00:42,417--> 01:00:46,750
No this helping, I want that you and Robin space home.

742
01:00:47,190--> 01:00:49,794
He needs a hospital, I will take care of that.

743
01:00:49,794--> 01:00:51,197
But he knows.

744
01:00:52,018--> 01:00:53,236
Take Robin and go home.

745
01:00:54,548--> 01:00:55,863
I said that will take care of that.

746
01:01:03,571--> 01:01:04,541
He knows.

747
01:01:05,021--> 01:01:05,578
Shit.

748
01:01:06,826--> 01:01:07,867
He/she had to liberate of me.

749
01:01:08,887--> 01:01:09,610
What?

750
01:01:10,279--> 01:01:11,022
And a madness.

751
01:01:11,630--> 01:01:12,836
What did he go mad?

752
01:01:13,282--> 01:01:14,138
And difficult.

753
01:01:16,060--> 01:01:18,210
Get rid of him.

754
01:01:21,907--> 01:01:23,102
The Institute.

755
01:01:24,903--> 01:01:26,283
Go there.

756
01:01:27,398--> 01:01:28,958
You will see.

757
01:01:29,920--> 01:01:30,759
Oh my God.

758
01:01:43,351--> 01:01:44,832
Agatha?

759
01:01:44,832--> 01:01:47,899
Walter, he didn't survive, I feel a lot.

760
01:01:49,005--> 01:01:49,952
Did something say?

761
01:01:50,606--> 01:01:52,201
No.

762
01:01:52,666--> 01:01:53,261
I feel a lot.

763
01:01:56,648--> 01:02:00,397
Who did you discover he was?

764
01:02:00,397--> 01:02:02,444
No. I will arrive home soon.

765
01:02:08,485--> 01:02:10,837
INSTITUTE NATHANIEL - CARE
PSYCHIATRIC

766
01:03:08,687--> 01:03:09,774
You

767
01:03:12,293--> 01:03:13,266
this

768
01:03:16,108--> 01:03:17,250
reading

769
01:03:26,026--> 01:03:28,019
Hell? ... this... waiting

770
01:03:31,525--> 01:03:32,495
Man Sparrow.

771
01:03:33,716--> 01:03:35,035
Oh, caralho!

772
01:03:35,240--> 01:03:37,971
They are me zoando...

773
01:03:41,073--> 01:03:41,980
Robin.

774
01:04:40,282--> 01:04:42,856
Each twentieth-third word of each twentieth-third paginates.

775
01:04:43,132--> 01:04:46,622
Visit Casanoca Spark. Marry under the stairways for the sky.

776
01:04:48,825--> 01:04:49,699
Who and Casanova Spark?

777
01:04:50,220--> 01:04:50,781
No and a person.

778
01:04:51,180--> 01:04:53,719
You adverto: "the hell you wait, Sparrow"

779
01:04:55,762--> 01:04:56,714
We have to go.

780
01:05:00,698--> 01:05:03,295
Dear Ag: We went
to the park Casanova

781
01:05:31,004--> 01:05:33,059
19 more 4 = 23

782
01:05:42,731--> 01:05:43,451
5 + 18

783
01:05:44,939--> 01:05:46,102
They are 23.

784
01:05:49,236--> 01:05:50,452
What did he go mad?

785
01:06:00,422--> 01:06:03,662
SPARROW
In case No. 85307

786
01:06:25,146--> 01:06:27,607
Does he/she want to bet that they are 23?

787
01:06:32,502--> 01:06:34,311
11, 12...

788
01:06:34,311--> 01:06:36,609
20, 21, 22...

789
01:06:42,107--> 01:06:43,740
Is he/she sure that he/she wants to do this?

790
01:06:47,479--> 01:06:51,944
Is it if the mom is right?
Is it if that man was not the author?

791
01:06:52,495--> 01:06:54,246
If it was alone his/her father or something like that?

792
01:06:55,465--> 01:06:57,162
I think that we have many "and if..."

793
01:06:58,163--> 01:07:00,525
Doesn't he/she mean that the true murderer still this the free?

794
01:07:09,440--> 01:07:10,406
Did he/she hear something?

795
01:07:12,870--> 01:07:14,717
This beginning to be similar to me, garotao.

796
01:07:23,169--> 01:07:25,251
Me of the the flashlight.
Me of the the flashlight!

797
01:07:30,070--> 01:07:31,348
Santo Deus...

798
01:07:39,000--> 01:07:40,016
We should go.

799
01:07:40,386--> 01:07:43,226
Me of the the flashlight, walks.
Me of the the flashlight!

800
01:07:43,806--> 01:07:45,105
We will leave of here.

801
01:07:55,226--> 01:07:56,711
There this a, soon there!

802
01:08:01,613--> 01:08:02,995
Be here.

803
01:08:06,410--> 01:08:08,367
911! Which and his/her emergency?

804
01:08:08,951--> 01:08:12,827
He/she has to order somebody
to the Parque Casanova.

805
01:08:17,563--> 01:08:18,957
By chance that and a joke?

806
01:08:20,600--> 01:08:21,622
This emptiness.

807
01:08:26,317--> 01:08:27,226
What?

808
01:08:28,832--> 01:08:29,856
He/she was...

809
01:08:30,569--> 01:08:31,792
He/she was there.

810
01:08:32,000--> 01:08:33,416
We are not crazy.

811
01:08:33,416--> 01:08:36,991
Each twentieth-third word of each twentieth-third paginates us said so that we came here.

812
01:08:37,604--> 01:08:39,547
And am I seeming totally crazy, ne?

813
01:08:39,946--> 01:08:41,817
They will sleep, we finished here.

814
01:08:42,865--> 01:08:44,378
10-23, we don't have anything.

815
01:08:47,871--> 01:08:48,599
Mom?

816
01:08:51,333--> 01:08:52,710
Oh, dear.

817
01:09:01,105--> 01:09:02,386
Are we going for house, good ta?

818
01:09:02,386--> 01:09:02,886
Yes.

819
01:09:13,912--> 01:09:15,631
A skeleton cannot be to put of foot like this and to flee.

820
01:09:16,134--> 01:09:18,196
You were right, that man was not the murderer...

821
01:09:19,105--> 01:09:21,959
The true murderer this loosens and he/she knows that dad the search.

822
01:09:24,574--> 01:09:26,992
The book had secret messages to each 23 paginate.

823
01:09:28,197--> 01:09:30,245
With certainty, to each 23 you paginate of the book.

824
01:09:30,816--> 01:09:33,096
Already I am enough the two.
Listen to me, 23 and only a number...

825
01:09:34,977--> 01:09:37,063
He/she doesn't have magic meaning, the people create that.

826
01:09:37,439--> 01:09:41,347
It doesn't import how many lunatics fantasized
on the number, but they make a mistake.

827
01:09:41,799--> 01:09:44,288
Any curse doesn't exist.
No there is none murder free.

828
01:09:52,852--> 01:09:53,674
And him.

829
01:09:56,884--> 01:09:57,953
That and Ned.

830
01:10:03,834--> 01:10:06,353
Filthy and evil dog,
and a dead dog.

831
01:10:11,617--> 01:10:12,446
Father!

832
01:10:13,015--> 01:10:14,196
Walter!

833
01:10:42,469--> 01:10:43,344
You

834
01:10:44,926--> 01:10:46,029
You were

835
01:10:48,140--> 01:10:49,408
You moved the skeleton

836
01:10:51,374--> 01:10:52,381
No knife that

837
01:10:52,598--> 01:10:53,765
How did he/she know?
Unless...

838
01:10:59,762--> 01:11:01,476
His/her unmarried woman last name and Rose

839
01:11:02,101--> 01:11:03,349
What does the one know and Rose?

840
01:11:03,973--> 01:11:06,741
Red and white. 92 divided by 4.

841
01:11:09,077--> 01:11:11,159
Some day I will write,
and that had happened with other.

842
01:11:12,540--> 01:11:13,299
My God!

843
01:11:13,561--> 01:11:16,228
Who wrote you knows well,
and he will only be able to answer you.

844
01:11:16,898--> 01:11:17,969
You wrote him/it.

845
01:11:20,919--> 01:11:22,307
Did Isacc know about that, not?

846
01:11:22,559--> 01:11:25,112
Walter, forgets that, please.

847
01:11:26,142--> 01:11:27,866
You and Topsy Kretts.

848
01:11:28,567--> 01:11:29,515
Maybe nor be a man.

849
01:11:29,515--> 01:11:31,761
- Don't force me to do this.
- Why Ag?

850
01:11:36,028--> 01:11:37,358
Why did make this?

851
01:11:39,337--> 01:11:41,631
With who this living?

852
01:11:50,542--> 01:11:51,870
So that this, Ag?

853
01:11:53,711--> 01:11:55,148
What will make with this?

854
01:11:56,608--> 01:11:59,074
I diffused to protect us...

855
01:12:00,134--> 01:12:03,189
... of who found in the mail.

856
01:12:03,482--> 01:12:06,276
Did he/she want to kill the poor man that published his/her book?

857
01:12:06,811--> 01:12:08,164
To protect his/her secret?

858
01:12:08,377--> 01:12:09,431
I will take charge of that.

859
01:12:09,431--> 01:12:11,383
He was alive when you ordered us away.

860
01:12:12,433--> 01:12:13,276
Robin had listened to you.

861
01:12:13,276--> 01:12:14,573
Don't we want that, truth?

862
01:12:15,296--> 01:12:17,946
That our son knows the horrible truth about the mother.

863
01:12:18,835--> 01:12:20,382
Mother, what does father, happen?

864
01:12:20,382--> 01:12:22,634
Her and Topsy Kretts.
She wrote the book.

865
01:12:23,071--> 01:12:23,871
No, no and truth.

866
01:12:24,373--> 01:12:26,575
Will his/her father loosen the knife, no and, Walter?

867
01:12:27,657--> 01:12:28,783
Tell him the truth.

868
01:12:29,545--> 01:12:32,140
Say how it took the skeleton.

869
01:12:32,515--> 01:12:35,532
Yes, Isacc and I moved the skeleton.

870
01:12:35,532--> 01:12:36,585
Truth?

871
01:12:36,585--> 01:12:39,633
And it would return her do him/it,
but I didn't write the book.

872
01:12:39,898--> 01:12:42,083
Don't lie. 13 years, Ag.

873
01:12:42,496--> 01:12:44,504
13 years of lies!
He/she ended.

874
01:12:44,947--> 01:12:46,274
No, no knife that with us, Walter!

875
01:12:46,274--> 01:12:47,601
Who wrote the book?

876
01:12:47,601--> 01:12:48,602
Say who wrote him/it.

877
01:12:48,602--> 01:12:49,603
Say!

878
01:12:51,874--> 01:12:53,620
You wrote the book, Walter.

879
01:12:58,502--> 01:13:00,184
SPARROW
In case No. 85307

880
01:13:06,591--> 01:13:08,848
I found this with the things of the old.

881
01:13:09,848--> 01:13:12,848
A Story of Obsession, by Topsy Kretts.

882
01:13:13,848--> 01:13:16,848
A Story of Obsession, by Walter Paul Sparrow

883
01:13:20,126--> 01:13:23,364
- You wrote my name there.
- No.

884
01:13:24,446--> 01:13:28,798
No, no, not.
Lie! This lying!

885
01:13:29,510--> 01:13:31,570
I didn't write that.

886
01:13:31,956--> 01:13:33,305
Then who was it?

887
01:13:36,955--> 01:13:37,455
You!

888
01:13:39,513--> 01:13:43,054
Were you two, you two the whole time, not?

889
01:13:43,768--> 01:13:46,446
What and that?
What this doing?

890
01:14:14,722--> 01:14:15,552
Father?

891
01:14:19,122--> 01:14:20,893
Father, what this happening?

892
01:14:21,937--> 01:14:23,430
Who killed the widow Dobkins?

893
01:14:25,144--> 01:14:26,285
Walter, let to help us.

894
01:14:29,010--> 01:14:30,442
The dressed woman of red.

895
01:14:30,711--> 01:14:32,093
That anger to do to feel better.

896
01:14:35,536--> 01:14:37,112
The case of the seductive Italian.

897
01:14:37,828--> 01:14:38,668
Curse!

898
01:14:45,121--> 01:14:45,879
Walter!

899
01:14:56,024--> 01:14:57,833
Naoooooo!
Leave!

900
01:14:58,986--> 01:15:00,455
We will catch his/her car.

901
01:15:01,511--> 01:15:02,670
We go, dear.

902
01:16:25,850--> 01:16:27,125
Chapter 23

903
01:16:28,718--> 01:16:30,047
They can call me of Fingerling.

904
01:16:31,484--> 01:16:33,383
But my true name and Walter.

905
01:16:34,727--> 01:16:37,065
Walter Paul Sparrow.

906
01:16:38,396--> 01:16:41,492
The one that you read ties here no and all the truth.

907
01:16:42,563--> 01:16:44,410
Most was changed to protect innocent.

908
01:16:45,633--> 01:16:46,959
And the criminal.

909
01:16:53,379--> 01:16:56,306
Once I read that the only philosophical question that matters...

910
01:16:56,621--> 01:16:57,976
... and to commit suicide or not.

911
01:16:59,724--> 01:17:02,162
I suppose that that makes me a philosopher.

912
01:17:05,101--> 01:17:06,810
He/she can one to say that and my decision.

913
01:17:07,761--> 01:17:09,212
After my mother's death...

914
01:17:10,363--> 01:17:11,947
... my father didn't get to tolerate...

915
01:17:17,382--> 01:17:18,887
... he/she didn't leave any ticket.

916
01:17:20,561--> 01:17:21,998
Only a number.

917
01:17:24,168--> 01:17:27,181
That number pursued me of adoptive house. it marries adoptive...

918
01:17:27,873--> 01:17:29,153
It ties the University, when I met her.

919
01:17:30,971--> 01:17:32,332
Laura Tollins.

920
01:17:33,218--> 01:17:36,061
I believed that she would help me to forget the number of my father.

921
01:17:38,341--> 01:17:40,562
It was a mistake to think that I would escape.

922
01:17:42,571--> 01:17:43,944
Press well.

923
01:17:47,901--> 01:17:49,665
Tell me that he/she has a knife.

924
01:17:51,273--> 01:17:52,247
I have a knife.

925
01:17:52,937--> 01:17:53,814
He/she cuts my blouse.

926
01:17:54,832--> 01:17:55,827
I will cut you more.

927
01:17:56,409--> 01:17:57,208
Cut.

928
01:17:58,488--> 01:17:59,228
I loved her.

929
01:18:03,753--> 01:18:04,701
And I believed that she loved me.

930
01:18:05,909--> 01:18:08,095
He/she has an obsession with the number 23.

931
01:18:08,438--> 01:18:10,656
And quite so has a power on him.

932
01:18:11,036--> 01:18:12,205
- And a type of madness?
- Yes.

933
01:18:12,932--> 01:18:15,840
It ties that the number of my father returned the look for me.

934
01:18:31,167--> 01:18:32,176
This crazy one?

935
01:18:32,955--> 01:18:34,419
That cursed number!

936
01:18:36,008--> 01:18:37,660
THE STAIRWAYS FOR THE SKY

937
01:18:56,273--> 01:18:58,881
When I marked each twentieth-third letter of his/her ticket...

938
01:19:01,278--> 01:19:02,947
Everything was clear.

939
01:19:06,407--> 01:19:08,367
The number came behind me.

940
01:19:12,601--> 01:19:13,686
It is now he wanted her.

941
01:19:17,705--> 01:19:22,206
Laura, you have to go, please.
I don't get to impede him/it!

942
01:19:22,891--> 01:19:23,847
What?

943
01:19:24,732--> 01:19:25,481
The number.

944
01:19:27,399--> 01:19:27,899
No.

945
01:19:28,499--> 01:19:29,464
He/she leaves me alone.

946
01:19:33,120--> 01:19:36,091
Does it think he/she has culhao for using that?
He/she is going ahead!

947
01:19:40,188--> 01:19:41,088
He/she kills me.

948
01:19:46,295--> 01:19:47,237
I love you!

949
01:19:49,534--> 01:19:52,306
I don't love you...
... I never loved you.

950
01:19:53,687--> 01:19:55,135
How would it be able to?

951
01:19:56,720--> 01:19:58,136
How could anybody make that?

952
01:19:59,278--> 01:20:00,304
You and pathetic.

953
01:20:02,427--> 01:20:03,887
Equal to his/her father.

954
01:20:06,474--> 01:20:07,548
Release!

955
01:20:32,963--> 01:20:34,211
I was right.

956
01:20:35,478--> 01:20:36,924
She was in danger.

957
01:20:37,875--> 01:20:39,850
Only that I didn't know that
the danger was me.

958
01:20:57,622--> 01:20:59,447
Laura?

959
01:21:04,504--> 01:21:05,543
Laura?

960
01:21:44,430--> 01:21:48,045
What began as a suicidal ticket, it finished in something more.

961
01:22:01,711--> 01:22:03,593
In a lot, much more...

962
01:22:24,342--> 01:22:25,828
Curse, curse!
I see him/it everywhere!

963
01:22:30,055--> 01:22:31,131
More amusement and games.

964
01:22:33,835--> 01:22:34,890
Laura?

965
01:22:45,646--> 01:22:46,980
Shit!

966
01:22:47,606--> 01:22:50,276
Almost, I am close...

967
01:22:50,276--> 01:22:52,278
No and truth.

968
01:22:52,827--> 01:22:54,853
No, no, not.

969
01:23:01,013--> 01:23:02,229
I love you!

970
01:23:02,229--> 01:23:03,508
That imbecile!

971
01:23:03,964--> 01:23:05,703
Sign of admiration!

972
01:23:13,134--> 01:23:14,636
LAURA DIED

973
01:23:36,827--> 01:23:38,205
Does he/she remember that?

974
01:23:47,369--> 01:23:48,857
The number 23

975
01:23:49,875--> 01:23:52,960
A Story of Obsession, by Walter Paul Sparrow

976
01:24:06,165--> 01:24:07,247
I believe that was the fall.

977
01:24:07,997--> 01:24:09,297
You have a serious traumatism...

978
01:24:09,297--> 01:24:11,763
... something common in case of such severe les.es...

979
01:24:11,763--> 01:24:14,181
But it could recover the memory,
tomorrow or never again...

980
01:24:15,491--> 01:24:18,715
And necessary to consider the report of instability
mental of the family.

981
01:24:19,606--> 01:24:21,367
His/her own father tried to commit suicide.

982
01:24:21,771--> 01:24:23,623
But he/she didn't have success.

983
01:24:26,082--> 01:24:28,027
Once Laura's trauma seemed to be a fiction...

984
01:24:28,665--> 01:24:29,811
And that text?

985
01:24:29,811--> 01:24:33,225
Severe Grafomania,
result of a mind divagante.

986
01:24:33,697--> 01:24:36,637
Guilty conscience for survival mixed with an obsession by numerologia.

987
01:24:38,495--> 01:24:39,934
And something very complicated, Dr.

988
01:24:41,649--> 01:24:42,669
I will do what can.

989
01:24:44,067--> 01:24:46,404
Do look, can I be with the book?

990
01:24:46,989--> 01:24:47,887
Thank you.

991
01:24:49,957--> 01:24:52,579
My story, my confession.

992
01:24:53,274--> 01:24:54,373
My name and Dr. Nathaniel.

993
01:24:54,701--> 01:24:55,688
I will never return her see him/it.

994
01:24:57,540--> 01:24:59,361
Some hurt they heal in some time...

995
01:25:00,783--> 01:25:02,601
... some are too deep to recover.

996
01:25:04,330--> 01:25:06,943
Like this, I preferred to block that horrible thing which I had done...

997
01:25:07,842--> 01:25:09,319
And their reasons.

998
01:25:11,784--> 01:25:13,467
- Take care!
- I hope not to see you never again.

999
01:25:13,467--> 01:25:14,216
I wait like this.

1000
01:25:14,511--> 01:25:15,550
Don't return.

1001
01:25:15,550--> 01:25:16,551
Beauty.

1002
01:25:26,630--> 01:25:28,457
Oh God!
I lament...

1003
01:25:29,292--> 01:25:30,082
Oh not!

1004
01:25:30,344--> 01:25:32,007
Agatha didn't know anything about my past.

1005
01:25:33,945--> 01:25:35,622
Like this, we were two.

1006
01:25:37,048--> 01:25:38,047
He/she was free for the time being.

1007
01:25:39,565--> 01:25:40,830
But the number found a new victim.

1008
01:25:41,919--> 01:25:43,997
The number left me alone
for 13 years...

1009
01:25:46,416--> 01:25:47,891
It ties the night in that she found my book.

1010
01:25:50,695--> 01:25:51,684
Or the book she found.

1011
01:26:16,577--> 01:26:17,695
It was here that I wrote everything.

1012
01:26:20,044--> 01:26:20,821
I went me.

1013
01:26:22,420--> 01:26:23,333
I am a murderer.

1014
01:26:29,003--> 01:26:31,275
I don't know what happened you,
but I know well about this...

1015
01:26:33,884--> 01:26:37,351
... you no and a bad person that got better...

1016
01:26:38,296--> 01:26:40,494
... you were a sick person that got well.

1017
01:26:41,467--> 01:26:42,411
I killed Laura Tollins.

1018
01:26:47,030--> 01:26:49,147
He/she has an innocent man arrested by my cause.

1019
01:26:51,173--> 01:26:52,649
You and a wonderful husband.

1020
01:26:53,483--> 01:26:56,007
And you and the best father
that a son can have.

1021
01:26:57,915--> 01:26:59,564
What Robin would do without you?

1022
01:27:01,983--> 01:27:04,360
But I let to suffer an innocent man.

1023
01:27:05,171--> 01:27:07,016
For my horrible sin.

1024
01:27:08,500--> 01:27:10,581
We were lost, Walter.

1025
01:27:11,033--> 01:27:14,485
Does he/she remind that he/she told me that his/her life began when we met each other?

1026
01:27:16,070--> 01:27:18,843
My life began that day also.

1027
01:27:19,194--> 01:27:20,789
I didn't know who I was.

1028
01:27:20,789--> 01:27:22,158
I didn't know who I was.

1029
01:27:23,414--> 01:27:24,669
I want that it leaves, Ag.

1030
01:27:25,709--> 01:27:26,876
You should go before...

1031
01:27:28,757--> 01:27:29,710
Before the one what?

1032
01:27:35,748--> 01:27:36,888
Before it kills me?

1033
01:27:40,870--> 01:27:41,900
Curse, Walter!

1034
01:27:42,851--> 01:27:43,646
Look!

1035
01:27:44,230--> 01:27:45,849
This, this and who you were.

1036
01:27:46,807--> 01:27:48,157
This no and who you and.

1037
01:27:49,831--> 01:27:50,794
This no and who you and.

1038
01:27:51,154--> 01:27:51,949
I am a murderer!

1039
01:27:54,320--> 01:27:56,367
I killed somebody!

1040
01:27:58,251--> 01:27:59,270
I killed somebody!

1041
01:28:00,767--> 01:28:01,752
And it could return her do him/it...

1042
01:28:02,294--> 01:28:03,395
Do you think he/she would make him/it again?

1043
01:28:06,092--> 01:28:07,542
Then it takes this.

1044
01:28:08,217--> 01:28:10,747
He/she is going ahead!
If you and a murderer, then kills me!

1045
01:28:11,494--> 01:28:14,679
Look about of you, all those beautiful ones 23!
Don't you want disappoint them, does he/she want?

1046
01:28:16,260--> 01:28:17,155
Knife!

1047
01:28:20,336--> 01:28:21,244
I love you!

1048
01:28:22,293--> 01:28:24,701
No, don't say that...

1049
01:28:26,948--> 01:28:27,661
I love you!

1050
01:28:27,661--> 01:28:28,662
No, you are not able to...

1051
01:28:34,301--> 01:28:35,242
Nobody can...

1052
01:29:13,044--> 01:29:13,901
Father!

1053
01:29:25,146--> 01:29:26,378
Destiny doesn't exist.

1054
01:29:28,998--> 01:29:30,117
Only different decis.es exist.

1055
01:29:49,338--> 01:29:50,475
It is just a number.

1056
01:29:51,984--> 01:29:53,331
Some decis.es are easy.

1057
01:29:54,202--> 01:29:55,539
Some not.

1058
01:29:56,328--> 01:29:57,515
Those are the ones that matter really.

1059
01:29:58,558--> 01:30:00,020
The ones that define us as people.

1060
01:30:02,156--> 01:30:04,355
<i> THE Mister and my Shepherd, and anything I had lacked...</i>

1061
01:30:05,343--> 01:30:07,523
<i> to Lie down does at green pastures, < /i > </i>

1062
01:30:08,156--> 01:30:10,412
<i> it guides me gently you water her calm...</i>

1063
01:30:11,791--> 01:30:13,495
13 years ago, I made a wrong decision.

1064
01:30:16,257--> 01:30:17,549
He/she needed to correct her.

1065
01:30:19,509--> 01:30:20,935
And not only for me.

1066
01:30:38,892--> 01:30:40,837
To die there in the street would have been very easy.

1067
01:30:42,069--> 01:30:43,440
But it would not be exactly.

1068
01:30:44,938--> 01:30:47,832
At least not in the concept of justice
that a father teaches to a son.

1069
01:30:57,106--> 01:30:58,581
They sentenced me in more or less one week.

1070
01:30:59,650--> 01:31:02,584
The lawyer said that the judge will be
indulgent for me to have given me.

1071
01:31:04,570--> 01:31:06,318
Maybe this is not the happiest end of all.

1072
01:31:07,369--> 01:31:08,376
But and the right.

1073
01:31:11,136--> 01:31:12,492
Some day they will give me probation.

1074
01:31:13,189--> 01:31:14,561
And we can proceed with our lives.

1075
01:31:15,344--> 01:31:16,457
And only a subject of time.

1076
01:31:18,126--> 01:31:19,767
Of course the time and only a murderous system...

1077
01:31:21,307--> 01:31:23,711
... with numbers with a composed meaning arrested to him.

1078
01:31:27,931--> 01:31:28,830
Or not?

1079
01:31:30,322--> 01:31:35,417
<b >::: NUMBER 23 :::

1080

"Be sure that yours
sin he had found!"
