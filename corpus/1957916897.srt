<i>Today we will be speaking...</i>

5
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:42,476
<i>of the inner turmoil</i>
<i>that plagues us all.</i>

6
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:47,214
<i>The deep-seated trauma</i>
<i>of our lives.</i>

7
00:00:49,684 --> 00:00:52,687
<i>The only way</i>

8
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,692
<i>from the trauma</i>

9
00:00:57,725 --> 00:00:59,561
<i>and ascend</i>

10
00:01:02,697 --> 00:01:04,197
<i>is to remember.</i>

11
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:08,235
<i>There are two psyches.</i>

12
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:11,104
<i>There is the divine psyche.</i>

13
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,243
<i>And the conscious psyche.</i>

14
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:20,682
<i>This meat. This flesh.</i>

15
00:01:20,715 --> 00:01:22,416
<i>This is not you.</i>

16
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:24,418
<i>This is not--</i>

17
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:27,789
<i>this is not you!</i>

18
00:01:27,822 --> 00:01:29,857
<i>Within you</i>
<i>there is the divine.</i>

19
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:35,295
<i>Melding those</i>
<i>is the only way</i>

20
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:37,665
<i>you can ascend.</i>

21
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:42,770
<i>Ascend and touch the pure</i>

22
00:01:42,804 --> 00:01:46,106
<i>and perfect being...</i>

23
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:49,176
<i>that is above.</i>

24
00:02:31,653 --> 00:02:33,521
Why don't you get some perfume
before we meet up again?

25
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:35,590
Excuse me?

26
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:38,826
You need to get some perfume
before we meet.

27
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:42,697
How charming.
Are you implying that I smell?

28
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,365
Listen Ruby, I'm not saying
that you smell bad.

29
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:48,402
Or that you smell good,
but...

30
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:52,439
just, you smell like
you've been

31
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:53,941
with four other men tonight.

32
00:02:53,975 --> 00:02:56,544
I have been
with four other men tonight.

33
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:58,345
Exactly.

34
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,915
I don't need to go home
to the old ball and chain,

35
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:03,685
smelling like four other
filthy fucking bastards.

36
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:07,454
Duffy, you are one of those
filthy bastards.

37
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:11,893
Listen, you gotta get this shit,
it's called Rose Summer?

38
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:14,361
It's what my wife uses.

39
00:03:14,929 --> 00:03:16,196
It's not Chanel...

40
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:19,967
-but it'll mask the stench of--
-Stench?

41
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:22,737
Odor?

42
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:26,373
Whatever.
Fuck you, Duffy.

43
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,743
Not 'til you get that perfume,
my dear.

44
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,454
Ruby!

45
00:03:41,022 --> 00:03:42,824

-Hi!

46
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,460

47
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:48,963
Oh, I'm just peachy.

48
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:51,966
-That bad, huh?
-Mm-hmm.

49
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:53,868
Come here. Let's go out.

50
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,005
No.
I'm gonna call it a night.

51
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,807
-Okay.
-I'm going to bed.

52
00:03:59,841 --> 00:04:02,476
-Okay. Get home safely.
-I will.

53
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,811

00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:53,594
Right.

180
00:19:53,628 --> 00:19:54,896
Hey, did you get that perfume
I asked you to get?

181
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,864
What?

182
00:19:56,898 --> 00:19:59,366
Uh, yeah, I got it.

183
00:20:00,668 --> 00:20:03,805
-Rose Summer?
-Yes Duffy. Rose Summer.

184
00:20:03,838 --> 00:20:05,372
Perfect.

185
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:08,341
And I got that coke
that you wanted.

186
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,944
I did not ask for that.

187
00:20:10,444 --> 00:20:12,212
Well, yeah,
well, I've got it.

188
00:20:12,814 --> 00:20:14,247
And we're going to
do it tonight.

189
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:16,416
Duffy. No.

190
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,351
Listen,
I come to you to do the shit

191
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:19,821
that I'm not allowed
to do at home.

192
00:20:19,854 --> 00:20:21,556
So tonight,
we're going to do the shit

193
00:20:21,589 --> 00:20:22,890
that I'm not allowed
to do at home.

194
00:20:27,028 --> 00:20:28,963
Come on, my wife
would fucking kill me

195
00:20:28,996 --> 00:20:30,798
if she knew
I was doing this shit.

196
00:20:30,832 --> 00:20:32,600
And she certainly
wouldn't do any of it with me.

197
00:20:33,601 --> 00:20:34,769
So, I guess
that leaves you.

198
00:20:35,837 --> 00:20:36,904
Ruby.

199
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,041
I don't know.

200
00:20:40,074 --> 00:20:41,876
It's been a strange day
already.

201
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,277
You just need
a little pick me up.

202
00:20:47,648 --> 00:20:48,716
Pay me double.

203
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:50,852
Sure, that works.

204
00:20:50,885 --> 00:20:52,553
Fine.

205
00:20:52,587 --> 00:20:53,554
All right,
that's what I'm talking about.

206
00:20:53,588 --> 00:20:54,655
Come here.

207
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,882
Ruby! Ruby, wake up.

208
00:21:55,249 --> 00:21:57,384
Fuck! Fuck! Ruby!

209
00:21:57,752 --> 00:21:59,954
Ruby! God--
God fucking dammit!

210
00:22:00,555 --> 00:22:01,823
Wake up!

211
00:22:06,894 --> 00:22:08,529
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

212
00:26:13,908 --> 00:26:17,078
Can you hear me?

213
00:26:18,012 --> 00:26:20,848
You're at Metro West Hospital.

214
00:26:26,821 --> 00:26:28,989
You're very badly injured.

215
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:31,292
You almost didn't make it.

216
00:26:38,766 --> 00:26:40,835
We were able
to remove the rebar.

217
00:26:40,868 --> 00:26:42,369
It missed
all your vital organs.

218
00:26:42,403 --> 00:26:44,872
There was some damage
to your small intestine.

219
00:26:50,277 --> 00:26:52,113
You also have
an orbital fracture

220
00:26:52,146 --> 00:26:53,881
in your face.

221
00:26:53,914 --> 00:26:55,316
We were able to remove
all the grass shards,

222
00:26:55,349 --> 00:26:57,118
stitch you up
and clean your wounds.

223
00:26:57,151 --> 00:26:59,687
It's gonna take
a couple months to heal.

224
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:03,858
It's going to be okay.

225
00:27:04,825 --> 00:27:06,694
But I think for now,

226
00:27:06,727 --> 00:27:08,028
I should probably let you
get some rest and recover.

227
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:09,997
Okay.

228
00:28:14,128 --> 00:28:15,796
Um, excuse me.

229
00:28:15,829 --> 00:28:17,264
Typical street whore.

230
00:28:17,298 --> 00:28:18,365
Probably got
the shit kicked out of her

231
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,067
by her pimp.

232
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,102
Listen, bandage her up,
get her out of here.

233
00:28:22,136 --> 00:28:23,871
Don't--
no special treatment.

234
00:28:23,904 --> 00:28:25,306
We don't need more of them
on the street.

235
00:28:25,873 --> 00:28:27,208
Excuse me?

236
00:28:27,241 --> 00:28:28,809
What the fuck
did you just say?

237
00:28:31,845 --> 00:28:33,113
I'm sorry, ma'am,
this, uh--

238
00:28:33,147 --> 00:28:34,381
this doesn't concern you.

239
00:28:34,415 --> 00:28:36,784
Actually, it fucking does.

240
00:28:36,817 --> 00:28:38,485
That's my fucking friend
in there.

241
00:28:40,854 --> 00:28:43,791
Ma'am,
visiting hours are over.

242
00:28:45,092 --> 00:28:47,027
And I suggest
that you leave.

243
00:28:51,566 --> 00:28:55,069
You know,
you look really familiar.

244
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,138
I probably
busted you before.

245
00:29:00,441 --> 00:29:02,009
Nah. That ain't it.

246
00:29:03,277 --> 00:29:05,112
I don't forget
the pigs that bust me.

247
00:29:07,014 --> 00:29:08,082
I'll remember.

248
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:18,526
Listen, just bandage her up,
get her out of here.

249
00:30:03,237 --> 00:30:04,305
"Our Father...

250
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,075
who art in cosmic heaven.

251
00:30:10,177 --> 00:30:13,213
Hallowed be
thy astronomical name.

252
00:30:14,214 --> 00:30:15,416
Thy kingdom come.

253
00:30:17,084 --> 00:30:18,485
Thy will be done...

254
00:30:19,953 --> 00:30:22,122
as it is
on this earthly plane."

255
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,158
Hey, um, hi.

256
00:30:24,191 --> 00:30:26,427
Hi, uh, your--
your name's Roy, right?

257
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,928
Yeah. Hi.

258
00:30:27,961 --> 00:30:29,463
Hi, I'm-- I'm Zoe.

259
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:31,131
Um, I'm a friend of Ruby's.
You know Ruby?

260
00:30:31,566 --> 00:30:33,100
"Lead us not...

261
00:30:34,935 --> 00:30:37,171
to dimensional...

262
00:30:38,138 --> 00:30:39,507
transformative...

263
00:30:41,676 --> 00:30:43,578
temptation."

264
00:30:43,611 --> 00:30:46,614
Okay, well, she's in there
and she is hurt really bad,

265
00:30:46,648 --> 00:30:48,382
and they won't tell me
anything.

266
00:30:48,415 --> 00:30:50,017
And there's this fucking cop,

267
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,586
and he's being
such a fucking prick,

268
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:53,320
and they won't let me know
if she's alive.

269
00:30:53,354 --> 00:30:54,888
They won't let me know
if know she's dead.

270
00:30:54,922 --> 00:30:56,290
I just want to know

271
00:30:56,323 --> 00:30:57,424
that my friend
is going to be okay,

272
00:30:57,458 --> 00:30:59,159
and I don't know anything.

273
00:30:59,193 --> 00:31:01,195
"Yours is the kingdom
and the power...

274
00:31:02,229 --> 00:31:03,297
of glory.

275
00:31:05,432 --> 00:31:07,935
Forever and ever.

276
00:31:11,405 --> 00:31:13,207
Amen."

277
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,110
Okay. It's okay.
Hey, uh, I-- I work here.

278
00:31:16,143 --> 00:31:19,446
I-- I'm a nurse, uh,
and if-- if Ruby's in there,

279
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,981
I'll-- I'll find her.

280
00:31:21,014 --> 00:31:22,349
Okay?

281
00:31:22,383 --> 00:31:23,685
Uh, everything's
gonna be all right.

282
00:31:23,718 --> 00:31:25,587
-All right?
-Okay. Thank you.

283
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,661
Who-- who are you?

284
00:31:37,498 --> 00:31:38,566
Oh.

285
00:31:40,267 --> 00:31:41,335
You're awake.

286
00:31:43,971 --> 00:31:46,608
I am Father Isiah Ross.

287
00:31:49,476 --> 00:31:50,545
Oh...

288
00:31:51,979 --> 00:31:54,214
I've seen you on TV.

289
00:31:55,717 --> 00:31:56,984
Yes?

290
00:31:58,185 --> 00:32:01,488
Are you a subscriber
to my video series?

291
00:32:04,258 --> 00:32:05,593
No.

292
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,294
Oh.

293
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,666
Okay. That's okay.

294
00:32:18,372 --> 00:32:20,474
Are you in pain?

295
00:32:21,776 --> 00:32:23,444
My dear.

296
00:32:29,717 --> 00:32:30,984
Hmm...

297
00:32:32,687 --> 00:32:35,222
This should take
the edge off...

298
00:32:36,423 --> 00:32:37,491
a bit.

299
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:47,201
Anyway...

300
00:32:49,303 --> 00:32:52,439
what is your name,
my child?

301
00:32:55,242 --> 00:32:56,644
Ruby.

302
00:32:58,445 --> 00:32:59,647
Do you believe...

303
00:33:02,249 --> 00:33:05,052
in the Lord Almighty, Ruby?

304
00:33:08,422 --> 00:33:09,591
I'm sorry.

305
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:13,126
Why are you here?

306
00:33:16,096 --> 00:33:17,264
I have been sent...

307
00:33:19,667 --> 00:33:21,368
by the cosmic Father...

308
00:33:22,704 --> 00:33:25,707
to do his divine bidding.

309
00:33:27,274 --> 00:33:30,377
Something
brought me to you.

310
00:33:31,779 --> 00:33:33,247
Because I knew...

311
00:33:35,482 --> 00:33:38,252
that you are in great pain
and you needed...

312
00:33:39,386 --> 00:33:40,487
salvation.

313
00:33:41,689 --> 00:33:43,023
A savior.

314
00:33:46,661 --> 00:33:47,729
And here I am.

315
00:33:48,796 --> 00:33:51,131
Yeah, well...

316
00:33:52,499 --> 00:33:56,370
I think the doctors
have that handled.

317
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,407
Something haunts you.

318
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:03,811
Am I right?

319
00:34:19,192 --> 00:34:22,229
Tell me what torments you,
Ruby?

320
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:28,670
Right now, it's you.

321
00:34:29,704 --> 00:34:32,139
You're tormenting me.

322
00:34:34,876 --> 00:34:36,476
I'm just here to help.

323
00:34:42,316 --> 00:34:43,383
Now...

324
00:34:44,886 --> 00:34:47,522
tell me, Ruby...

325
00:34:49,524 --> 00:34:51,793
how did you end up here?

326
00:34:54,829 --> 00:34:58,231
Horrible men put me here.

327
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,669
Is that a fact?

328
00:35:03,705 --> 00:35:05,105
Yes.

329
00:35:05,907 --> 00:35:07,307
Fragile...

330
00:35:08,442 --> 00:35:12,112
pathetic egos.

331
00:35:12,747 --> 00:35:15,182
Just like yours.

332
00:35:20,487 --> 00:35:21,556
So...

333
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:28,630
it's masculinity
that traumatizes you.

334
00:35:30,732 --> 00:35:33,801
Tell me, Ruby,
have you ever heard...

335
00:35:35,268 --> 00:35:36,403
the concept...

336
00:35:37,538 --> 00:35:39,641
of the conscious

337
00:35:39,674 --> 00:35:41,876
and the divine psyche?

338
00:35:44,712 --> 00:35:45,780
No.

339
00:35:47,815 --> 00:35:48,883
Well...

340
00:35:50,484 --> 00:35:51,552
it's...

341
00:35:53,955 --> 00:35:55,690
a little thing
I picked up...

342
00:35:57,925 --> 00:36:00,728
through my divine travels...

343
00:36:01,896 --> 00:36:04,431
through
this earthly dimension.

344
00:36:11,371 --> 00:36:12,439
You see...

345
00:36:14,474 --> 00:36:17,578
humans are of two

346
00:36:17,612 --> 00:36:19,514
separate minds.

347
00:36:22,917 --> 00:36:25,853
In one, the conscious.

348
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:31,659
This holds our weakness.

349
00:36:34,896 --> 00:36:35,963
Our suffering...

350
00:36:37,464 --> 00:36:38,666
our trauma.

351
00:36:42,269 --> 00:36:43,705
And it keeps us...

352
00:36:44,706 --> 00:36:47,508
it clouds us...

353
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:52,547
from moving past...

354
00:36:53,715 --> 00:36:55,683
and inheriting...

355
00:36:56,818 --> 00:36:59,987
the pure divine light.

356
00:37:03,558 --> 00:37:07,227
Reaching
our full human potential.

357
00:37:10,497 --> 00:37:11,999
And then,

358
00:37:12,033 --> 00:37:15,002
there is the divine psyche.

359
00:37:17,404 --> 00:37:19,574
Like a perfect computer.

360
00:37:23,678 --> 00:37:25,813
And it's this earthly form...

361
00:37:26,781 --> 00:37:29,416
that keeps us,
holds us back...

362
00:37:32,653 --> 00:37:34,822
from achieving

363
00:37:34,856 --> 00:37:38,391
unlimited power
and potential.

364
00:37:43,564 --> 00:37:45,666
The only way...

365
00:37:47,735 --> 00:37:50,805
to combine these two...

366
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:59,547
is to relive your trauma.

367
00:38:00,948 --> 00:38:02,950
Feel it again.

368
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,654
Bear it.

369
00:38:08,589 --> 00:38:09,991
That's the only way...

370
00:38:11,092 --> 00:38:13,728
anyone can ascend.

371
00:38:17,965 --> 00:38:19,499
Do you understand, Ruby?

372
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:23,070
No.

373
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:28,375
It's okay.

374
00:38:30,077 --> 00:38:31,679
You will.

375
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:39,954
I know you're a whore.

376
00:38:47,562 --> 00:38:48,930
Do you know, Ruby...

377
00:38:50,798 --> 00:38:52,867
what the book of Leviticus

378
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:56,469
says about whores?

379
00:39:00,975 --> 00:39:02,043
No.

380
00:39:07,048 --> 00:39:08,783
It says

381
00:39:08,816 --> 00:39:12,086
they shall be burned

382
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:13,821
to death.

383
00:39:22,864 --> 00:39:23,998
And as much...

384
00:39:26,601 --> 00:39:29,036
as I love

385
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:31,539
a good cleansing
by fire...

386
00:39:32,707 --> 00:39:35,977
I have great faith

387
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:39,947
in my own healing techniques.

388
00:39:53,928 --> 00:39:55,129
Because even...

389
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:58,065
a man of the cloth...

390
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:01,002
must give in...

391
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:04,639
to temptation.

392
00:43:32,279 --> 00:43:34,048
Good morning, kitty.

393
00:43:34,715 --> 00:43:36,951
Thank you
for watching over me.

394
00:43:39,153 --> 00:43:40,354
How did we get home?

395
00:43:43,124 --> 00:43:44,191
Hmm?

396
00:44:44,118 --> 00:44:45,719
How long was I out for?

397
00:46:13,608 --> 00:46:14,875
Hello?

398
00:46:18,445 --> 00:46:20,114
<i>Hey, it's Roy.</i>

399
00:46:23,484 --> 00:46:24,552
Come on up.

400
00:46:41,536 --> 00:46:43,170
This happened on Tuesday?

401
00:46:43,904 --> 00:46:46,440
Yes.
You were with me that night.

402
00:46:47,107 --> 00:46:49,076
Don't you think
you would have noticed?

403
00:46:50,311 --> 00:46:52,046
I don't know.

404
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,014
It wasn't covered
with makeup or something?

405
00:46:55,249 --> 00:46:57,351
-You don't believe me?
-It's not that.

406
00:46:57,384 --> 00:46:59,920
It's just that
it doesn't make any sense.

407
00:46:59,953 --> 00:47:02,489
It's medically impossible.

408
00:47:03,591 --> 00:47:07,094
These wounds
are completely healed.

409
00:47:09,263 --> 00:47:12,032
From the look of it,
these scars could be years old.

410
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,468
It's a miracle.

411
00:47:15,069 --> 00:47:17,037
That's what I've been trying
to tell you.

412
00:47:18,138 --> 00:47:20,407
Something weird
is going on, Roy.

413
00:47:22,109 --> 00:47:23,944
Something really weird.

414
00:47:35,389 --> 00:47:37,424
Ruby,
do you believe in God?

415
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,427
No.

416
00:47:41,328 --> 00:47:42,396
Not really.

417
00:47:47,968 --> 00:47:49,470
Well, if you ask me,

418
00:47:49,504 --> 00:47:51,372
there's only
one explanation for this.

419
00:47:52,172 --> 00:47:53,374
It's a miracle from God.

420
00:47:58,212 --> 00:47:59,913
Hey, cute cat.

421
00:48:55,469 --> 00:48:56,704
Dear God.

422
00:48:58,706 --> 00:49:00,073
Or Lord.

423
00:49:02,309 --> 00:49:04,077
I don't know
what to call you.

424
00:49:07,314 --> 00:49:09,016
But if you are real...

425
00:49:10,518 --> 00:49:12,453
if you are listening...

426
00:49:15,523 --> 00:49:17,525
maybe you could help me.

427
00:49:23,631 --> 00:49:26,668
Is this what
I'm supposed to do?

428
00:49:28,435 --> 00:49:30,538
Why is this happening?

429
00:49:32,574 --> 00:49:35,342
Why is this
happening to me?

430
00:49:37,645 --> 00:49:40,748
Is this a part
of your plan?

431
00:49:44,786 --> 00:49:47,655
Am I supposed
to understand this?

432
00:49:51,693 --> 00:49:53,595
Are you even listening?

433
00:49:55,797 --> 00:49:57,097
Please, God.

434
00:50:07,441 --> 00:50:09,644
Just show me.

435
00:50:14,081 --> 00:50:15,783
Give me
some sort of sign.

436
00:50:47,447 --> 00:50:49,349
Who are you?

437
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:54,087
<i>I am.</i>

438
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:57,859
What do you want?

439
00:50:57,892 --> 00:51:02,162
<i>We want you, Ruby.</i>

440
00:51:04,331 --> 00:51:06,266
Why me?

441
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:09,269
<i>Have you ever experienced</i>

442
00:51:09,303 --> 00:51:11,371
<i>the sweet taste</i>

443
00:51:11,405 --> 00:51:14,576
<i>of someone else's blood?</i>

444
00:51:14,609 --> 00:51:16,209
Oh, God.

445
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:18,646
Help me.

446
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:22,115
<i>God cannot hear you.</i>

447
00:51:22,149 --> 00:51:26,554
<i>God does not love you.</i>

448
00:51:26,588 --> 00:51:29,724
<i>God doesn't even know</i>

449
00:51:29,757 --> 00:51:32,092
<i>you exist.</i>

450
00:51:33,427 --> 00:51:35,563
Are you going to
kill me?

451
00:51:35,597 --> 00:51:40,868
<i>We do not want</i>
<i>to kill you, Ruby.</i>

452
00:51:40,902 --> 00:51:46,139
<i>We cannot make you</i>
<i>a martyr.</i>

453
00:51:46,173 --> 00:51:48,810
<i>If you were to die,</i>

454
00:51:48,843 --> 00:51:53,213
<i>these people</i>
<i>would not care.</i>

455
00:51:53,246 --> 00:51:55,883
<i>They would simply see</i>

456
00:51:55,917 --> 00:51:58,853
<i>a dead harlot.</i>

457
00:51:58,886 --> 00:52:01,388
<i>Another young girl</i>

458
00:52:01,421 --> 00:52:03,825
<i>abused and forgotten</i>

459
00:52:03,858 --> 00:52:07,562
<i>by the patriarchy.</i>

460
00:52:07,595 --> 00:52:11,331
<i>And that does not fulfill</i>

461
00:52:11,365 --> 00:52:13,668
<i>our purpose.</i>

462
00:52:14,669 --> 00:52:18,305
<i>We need you, Ruby.</i>

463
00:52:18,338 --> 00:52:22,877
<i>You are one of us.</i>

464
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:25,412
Who?

465
00:54:48,689 --> 00:54:50,558
<i>Calms the nerves...</i>

466
00:54:50,591 --> 00:54:51,859
<i>Good morning.</i>

467
00:54:54,461 --> 00:54:56,063
<i>And now,</i>
<i>we have a very special</i>

468
00:54:56,097 --> 00:54:57,732
<i>video presentation</i>

469
00:54:57,765 --> 00:54:59,600
<i>for this city's</i>
<i>number one whore.</i>

470
00:54:59,634 --> 00:55:01,602
<i>That's right, Ruby.</i>
<i>We're looking at you.</i>

471
00:55:07,474 --> 00:55:08,609
<i>Tell 'em your name.</i>

472
00:55:11,378 --> 00:55:13,614
<i>Speak. Speak, pig.</i>

473
00:55:13,648 --> 00:55:15,817
<i>My name's Officer</i>
<i>William Duffy.</i>

474
00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:18,619
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>who these people are.</i>

475
00:55:18,653 --> 00:55:19,854
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what they want.</i>

476
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:27,427
- <i>Piggy, piggy, piggy.</i>
<i>- Please, help.</i>

477
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:29,764
<i>Help me! Help!</i>

478
00:55:29,797 --> 00:55:31,532
<i>They want you dead, fucker.</i>

479
00:55:31,566 --> 00:55:33,366
<i>Fucker, fucking dead. Dead!</i>

480
00:58:00,214 --> 00:58:01,882
<i>Wow.</i>

481
00:58:01,916 --> 00:58:04,218
<i>Now, that's what I call</i>
<i>a pig roast.</i>

482
00:58:20,167 --> 00:58:21,501
Pick up.

483
00:58:25,072 --> 00:58:26,907
Hey, it's Ruby.

484
00:58:28,109 --> 00:58:30,911
Listen, do you still
want to get out of here?

485
01:01:32,359 --> 01:01:33,861
Ruby, it's me, it's Roy.

486
01:01:34,361 --> 01:01:35,796
It's Roy.

487
01:01:41,068 --> 01:01:43,737
We got to go.
We got to go.

488
01:01:43,771 --> 01:01:44,939
We gotta
get out of here.

489
01:02:10,965 --> 01:02:12,466
So, you want to
tell me what's going on?

490
01:02:15,302 --> 01:02:18,272
Have I completely
lost my mind?

491
01:02:20,474 --> 01:02:21,976
Are you in some
sort of trouble?

492
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:26,280
It just
doesn't make any sense to me.

493
01:02:28,282 --> 01:02:31,485
Yeah, I'm, uh,
starting to feel the same way.

494
01:02:37,525 --> 01:02:39,860
Ruby, will you please,

495
01:02:39,893 --> 01:02:41,862
just tell me
what the hell is going on?

496
01:02:43,897 --> 01:02:45,065
These--

497
01:02:46,834 --> 01:02:48,435
these people...

498
01:02:50,004 --> 01:02:51,405
they're following me.

499
01:02:53,107 --> 01:02:54,174
Stalkers?

500
01:02:55,610 --> 01:02:56,944
No.

501
01:02:57,512 --> 01:02:59,146
Strangers.

502
01:03:01,048 --> 01:03:02,116
Only...

503
01:03:03,551 --> 01:03:05,886
they seem to know my name.

504
01:03:07,488 --> 01:03:09,390
Well, what do they want
from you?

505
01:03:09,423 --> 01:03:11,025
Do--

506
01:03:11,058 --> 01:03:12,393
do they want money?

507
01:03:12,426 --> 01:03:14,529
'Cause I've--
I've got money.

508
01:03:14,562 --> 01:03:17,197
And you're more
than welcome

509
01:03:17,231 --> 01:03:18,399
to-- to have it.

510
01:03:20,635 --> 01:03:24,104
There was something else
in the room that night.

511
01:03:25,105 --> 01:03:27,274
What? In our room?

512
01:03:29,577 --> 01:03:30,978
I saw him.

513
01:03:33,347 --> 01:03:34,516
He was there.

514
01:03:37,084 --> 01:03:38,352
And then last night...

515
01:03:39,654 --> 01:03:41,288
he came to me again.

516
01:03:45,593 --> 01:03:47,094
I couldn't move.

517
01:03:48,395 --> 01:03:49,463
I tried.

518
01:03:51,065 --> 01:03:53,334
But it was as if...

519
01:03:54,101 --> 01:03:56,571
I was being held down
by something.

520
01:03:58,405 --> 01:03:59,940
I could barely breathe.

521
01:04:01,208 --> 01:04:03,977
It felt like someone
was sitting on my chest.

522
01:04:06,514 --> 01:04:09,083
And he just appeared.

523
01:04:11,185 --> 01:04:12,953
He came out of the shadows.

524
01:04:14,121 --> 01:04:15,222
My God.

525
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:17,491
That's terrifying.

526
01:04:28,001 --> 01:04:29,236
It talked to me.

527
01:04:30,505 --> 01:04:31,939
It talked to you?

528
01:04:33,107 --> 01:04:34,908
He said they wanted me.

529
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:40,080
He said that
I was one of them.

530
01:04:40,914 --> 01:04:44,084
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

531
01:04:46,186 --> 01:04:48,021
Need you for what?

532
01:04:48,055 --> 01:04:49,423
- I don't know.
- One of who?

533
01:04:49,456 --> 01:04:50,625
I don't know.

534
01:04:52,025 --> 01:04:53,528
But they killed Duffy.

535
01:04:54,194 --> 01:04:55,229
Who?

536
01:04:57,197 --> 01:04:58,265
Duffy.

537
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,401
He was a client of mine.

538
01:05:01,168 --> 01:05:03,404
Oh, you mean
that asshole cop?

539
01:05:03,437 --> 01:05:05,139
He was a client of yours?

540
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:08,409
You knew him?

541
01:05:08,442 --> 01:05:10,244
Uh, kind of.

542
01:05:10,277 --> 01:05:12,246
I-- I knew--
I know his wife.

543
01:05:12,279 --> 01:05:13,548
She's a great doctor.

544
01:05:13,981 --> 01:05:16,551
Man, that guy's
a real piece of work.

545
01:05:17,117 --> 01:05:20,555
Uh, I mean,
no disrespect, but, like...

546
01:05:21,355 --> 01:05:23,123
sometimes you get
what you deserve.

547
01:05:32,567 --> 01:05:34,268
She saved my life.

548
01:05:37,539 --> 01:05:38,640
No.

549
01:05:39,674 --> 01:05:41,341
He saved your life,
Ruby.

550
01:05:50,117 --> 01:05:53,420
Now, don't do anything
you're going to regret, Ruby.

551
01:05:53,922 --> 01:05:56,990
You know, this is
a big opportunity for you.

552
01:05:57,024 --> 01:05:59,259
This could change
your whole life.

553
01:05:59,627 --> 01:06:01,028
He can save you.

554
01:06:01,495 --> 01:06:03,030
He saved us all.

555
01:06:04,064 --> 01:06:05,399
He saved us,
all right.

556
01:06:06,568 --> 01:06:08,736
You know,
it's true what they say.

557
01:06:10,638 --> 01:06:12,540
He works
in mysterious ways.

558
01:06:12,941 --> 01:06:16,376
And you may not understand it,
but it's what's best.

559
01:06:17,277 --> 01:06:19,980
He's got all of our
best interests in mind.

560
01:06:22,115 --> 01:06:23,317
It's scary.

561
01:06:24,117 --> 01:06:25,252
Growth is hard.

562
01:06:26,688 --> 01:06:28,121
You don't have a choice.

563
01:06:59,253 --> 01:07:02,524
<i>So, our sweet little Ruby</i>

564
01:07:02,557 --> 01:07:05,425
<i>has returned.</i>

565
01:07:05,459 --> 01:07:09,062
<i>Your cunning attempt</i>
<i>to escape us</i>

566
01:07:09,096 --> 01:07:12,600
<i>is so very disappointing.</i>

567
01:07:15,803 --> 01:07:19,072
Why did you kill Duffy?

568
01:07:19,106 --> 01:07:22,476
<i>It was our</i>
<i>will that he should suffer.</i>

569
01:07:22,510 --> 01:07:24,579
<i>Besides,</i>

570
01:07:24,612 --> 01:07:28,181
<i>have you not entertained</i>
<i>the notion yourself?</i>

571
01:07:28,215 --> 01:07:31,753
<i>Eliminating</i>
<i>the thorn in your side?</i>

572
01:07:31,786 --> 01:07:36,089
<i>A pain that you're now</i>
<i>quite familiar with?</i>

573
01:07:36,123 --> 01:07:38,292
Sure, he was an asshole.

574
01:07:39,126 --> 01:07:41,094
But I wasn't going to
kill him.

575
01:07:41,128 --> 01:07:43,397
<i>Oh, Ruby.</i>

576
01:07:43,430 --> 01:07:46,466
<i>We simply</i>
<i>released his spirit</i>

577
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:49,503
<i>from this earthly plane.</i>

578
01:07:49,537 --> 01:07:51,539
Where's Roy?

579
01:07:51,573 --> 01:07:55,843
<i>There's no</i>
<i>need to worry about Roy.</i>

580
01:07:55,877 --> 01:07:59,246
<i>He's in highly capable hands.</i>

581
01:08:04,484 --> 01:08:06,521
So, what?

582
01:08:07,087 --> 01:08:09,557
You're going to
kill him, too?

583
01:08:09,591 --> 01:08:13,728
<i>That is yet to be decided.</i>

584
01:08:14,629 --> 01:08:17,431
He didn't do anything.

585
01:08:17,464 --> 01:08:20,735
<i>Consider him as collateral.</i>

586
01:08:20,768 --> 01:08:22,537
<i>You, Ruby,</i>

587
01:08:22,570 --> 01:08:25,439
<i>are our investment.</i>

588
01:08:25,472 --> 01:08:29,142
<i>You attract</i>
<i>the transgressors,</i>

589
01:08:29,176 --> 01:08:32,780
<i>and we deal with them</i>
<i>as we see fit.</i>

590
01:08:35,282 --> 01:08:39,486
And what am I supposed
to do?

591
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,756
<i>All you have to do</i>

592
01:08:41,789 --> 01:08:43,591
<i>is prevail.</i>

593
01:08:44,491 --> 01:08:45,860
<i>Your presence</i>

594
01:08:45,893 --> 01:08:49,664
<i>is our existence.</i>

595
01:08:49,697 --> 01:08:51,599
<i>And from us,</i>

596
01:08:51,633 --> 01:08:55,603
<i>your life receives</i>
<i>a purpose.</i>

597
01:08:58,372 --> 01:09:01,475
And what
if I don't want to?

598
01:09:02,710 --> 01:09:04,378
<i>Well,</i>

599
01:09:04,411 --> 01:09:09,182
<i>that would be unacceptable.</i>

600
01:09:09,216 --> 01:09:13,220
<i>Do you not understand,</i>
<i>Ruby?</i>

601
01:09:13,253 --> 01:09:18,258
<i>We are your anti-saviors.</i>

602
01:09:18,291 --> 01:09:20,360
<i>Your anti-Christ,</i>

603
01:09:20,394 --> 01:09:23,397
<i>anti-heroes.</i>

604
01:09:24,866 --> 01:09:29,403
<i>And if you are not with us,</i>

605
01:09:29,436 --> 01:09:33,407
<i>then you are against us.</i>

606
01:11:07,668 --> 01:11:09,436
<i>Hey, uh, it's Roy.</i>

607
01:11:09,469 --> 01:11:11,304
<i>I'm not in right now,</i>
<i>so just--</i>

608
01:12:35,957 --> 01:12:38,425
Hey, it's Ruby.

609
01:12:38,926 --> 01:12:40,460
Could you meet me
somewhere?

610
01:13:21,535 --> 01:13:22,737
Let's go, boys.

611
01:13:52,767 --> 01:13:54,835
Thank you
for meeting me here, Zoey.

612
01:13:54,869 --> 01:13:56,904
I didn't know
where else to go.

613
01:13:56,938 --> 01:13:59,907
Oh, honey,
I'm so worried about you.

614
01:13:59,941 --> 01:14:01,709
It's totally okay.

615
01:14:01,742 --> 01:14:03,778
I can't believe you're out
of the hospital already.

616
01:14:03,811 --> 01:14:06,013
-Yeah. I can't either.
-Come in.

617
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:17,024
So, this is going to
sound a little crazy,

618
01:14:17,058 --> 01:14:20,795
but I have to tell you
what's been going on.

619
01:14:22,863 --> 01:14:24,932
Brothers, sisters...

620
01:14:25,866 --> 01:14:27,101
followers.

621
01:14:27,535 --> 01:14:30,972
There are demons
among us.

622
01:14:31,806 --> 01:14:33,473
You can't see them...

623
01:14:34,976 --> 01:14:36,777
with these,

624
01:14:36,811 --> 01:14:39,847
these human eyes.

625
01:14:42,216 --> 01:14:44,585
For they travel

626
01:14:44,618 --> 01:14:46,287
through dimensions

627
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:48,823
using gravitrons.

628
01:14:50,725 --> 01:14:53,861
You cannot sense them,

629
01:14:53,894 --> 01:14:54,996
but they are there!

630
01:14:55,495 --> 01:14:57,131
They are always there

631
01:14:57,164 --> 01:14:59,667
watching, tasting the...

632
01:15:00,801 --> 01:15:03,170
spit that comes
from your mouth.

633
01:15:07,141 --> 01:15:09,510
Can I help you,
brother?

634
01:15:15,282 --> 01:15:16,984
We have a...

635
01:15:18,119 --> 01:15:20,187
sermon happening here.

636
01:15:20,221 --> 01:15:22,189
Is there anything
I can help you with?

637
01:15:23,024 --> 01:15:25,693
I just wanted to see
where the magic was made.

638
01:15:27,795 --> 01:15:30,131
Well,
now you've seen it.

639
01:15:31,966 --> 01:15:33,100
You can go.

640
01:15:34,301 --> 01:15:36,270
I'm sorry,
my friends want to see

641
01:15:36,303 --> 01:15:37,772
where the magic is made,
too.

642
01:15:38,507 --> 01:15:40,641
Come on.

643
01:15:42,143 --> 01:15:44,245
Hey, hey, hey, now.

644
01:15:44,945 --> 01:15:48,716
Uh, if this is about
the councilman's daughter,

645
01:15:48,749 --> 01:15:51,685
I can assure you,
we settled that out of court.

646
01:15:51,719 --> 01:15:53,120
Oh, no, no.

647
01:15:54,055 --> 01:15:55,790
We're friends of Ruby's.

648
01:15:57,091 --> 01:15:58,192
Oh, shit.

649
01:16:50,945 --> 01:16:53,280
So, who the fuck
are these psychos?

650
01:16:55,182 --> 01:16:57,751
I've either
lost my goddamn mind,

651
01:16:57,785 --> 01:17:01,288
or they really are some
sadistic cult from hell.

652
01:17:03,057 --> 01:17:04,792
You think they're demons?

653
01:17:05,893 --> 01:17:07,294
I don't know.

654
01:17:07,328 --> 01:17:08,929
I don't really believe
in that stuff.

655
01:17:10,197 --> 01:17:11,699
But you believe in hell.

656
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:15,336
What if this is hell,
Zoey?

657
01:17:19,106 --> 01:17:20,241
You're serious.

658
01:17:21,308 --> 01:17:22,643
Fuck.

659
01:17:23,110 --> 01:17:25,346
What if I really
did die the other night?

660
01:17:25,980 --> 01:17:29,049
No, no. No, no.
You're right here with me.

661
01:17:29,083 --> 01:17:31,285
I just don't know
what to do, Zoey.

662
01:17:31,318 --> 01:17:33,387
Oh, okay.
It's okay.

663
01:17:33,420 --> 01:17:35,456
-It's going to be okay.
-I don't know what to do.

664
01:17:35,489 --> 01:17:36,891
It's going to be okay.

665
01:17:42,429 --> 01:17:44,265
All right.

666
01:17:44,298 --> 01:17:46,400
- Face down, on the bed, ladies.
- What the fuck?

667
01:17:46,433 --> 01:17:48,269
Face down
onto the fucking bed now.

668
01:17:48,936 --> 01:17:50,271
Dammit.

669
01:17:50,304 --> 01:17:51,705
- God!
- Stay fucking still.

670
01:17:51,739 --> 01:17:53,407
Ruby?

671
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:56,143
Some fucking friends you got,
you know what I mean?

672
01:17:56,177 --> 01:17:57,745
Stay still.

673
01:17:57,778 --> 01:17:58,846
This will all be over.

674
01:17:59,813 --> 01:18:01,682
Don't fucking move.

675
01:18:02,283 --> 01:18:03,884
Don't fucking move.

676
01:18:05,219 --> 01:18:07,087
Fucking--

677
01:18:09,790 --> 01:18:11,358
This ain't nothing personal,
Ruby.

678
01:18:13,427 --> 01:18:17,331
It's just a little
added security measure.

679
01:18:18,533 --> 01:18:20,167
Now, give me your wrist.

680
01:18:20,201 --> 01:18:21,902
Give me your wrist.

681
01:18:21,936 --> 01:18:23,337
Give me your fucking wrist
right now.

682
01:18:23,837 --> 01:18:25,339
This will all
be over soon.

683
01:18:28,175 --> 01:18:29,443
For you.

684
01:18:32,012 --> 01:18:33,113
There we go.

685
01:20:19,453 --> 01:20:22,222
Don't move.
Be right back.

686
01:22:28,182 --> 01:22:31,351
<i>Welcome, Ruby.</i>

687
01:22:31,385 --> 01:22:35,222
<i>Tonight,</i>
<i>you are our master</i>

688
01:22:35,255 --> 01:22:38,192
<i>of ceremonies.</i>

689
01:22:38,225 --> 01:22:40,595
<i>Please, rise.</i>

690
01:22:57,211 --> 01:23:01,683
<i>Reveal our sacrifice.</i>

691
01:23:31,078 --> 01:23:33,013
<i>Crucify him.</i>

692
01:24:03,645 --> 01:24:07,815
<i>He must die</i>
<i>for his sins.</i>

693
01:25:05,873 --> 01:25:07,508
I can't.

694
01:25:11,813 --> 01:25:15,583
<i>If you cannot</i>
<i>punish your transgressor...</i>

695
01:25:16,618 --> 01:25:18,753
<i>then we will be forced</i>

696
01:25:18,786 --> 01:25:21,889
<i>to punish your allies.</i>

697
01:25:27,662 --> 01:25:29,262
Oh, my God.

698
01:25:34,736 --> 01:25:36,704
Oh, my God.

699
01:26:03,865 --> 01:26:05,232
Oh.

700
01:26:06,233 --> 01:26:07,467
This one
didn't make it.

701
01:26:08,936 --> 01:26:10,838
<i>What a shame.</i>

702
01:26:14,408 --> 01:26:15,943
You sick fucks.

703
01:26:16,577 --> 01:26:18,813
You told me
I didn't have to do anything.

704
01:26:20,313 --> 01:26:22,482
<i>I lied.</i>

705
01:26:23,618 --> 01:26:26,253
<i>Now, unless you wish</i>

706
01:26:26,286 --> 01:26:29,222
<i>the same fate upon Roy,</i>

707
01:26:29,256 --> 01:26:33,193
<i>I suggest you obey us.</i>

708
01:28:37,384 --> 01:28:38,920
<i>Wonderful.</i>

709
01:28:40,655 --> 01:28:43,724
<i>Now, do you remember</i>

710
01:28:43,758 --> 01:28:46,561
<i>what he said on television</i>

711
01:28:46,594 --> 01:28:49,362
<i>the first time you saw him?</i>

712
01:28:50,397 --> 01:28:51,498
No.

713
01:28:52,967 --> 01:28:56,037
<i>Well, he recited</i>

714
01:28:56,070 --> 01:28:58,706
<i>quite a lovely passage</i>

715
01:28:58,739 --> 01:29:01,843
<i>about dismembering</i>
<i>body parts</i>

716
01:29:01,876 --> 01:29:04,078
<i>that cause you to sin.</i>

717
01:29:08,850 --> 01:29:10,084
No!

718
01:29:14,487 --> 01:29:16,389
<i>I highly doubt</i>

719
01:29:16,423 --> 01:29:19,560
<i>that he will make it</i>
<i>into heaven</i>

720
01:29:19,594 --> 01:29:24,397
<i>with those disgraceful</i>
<i>genitals intact.</i>

721
01:30:27,828 --> 01:30:30,031
I don't forgive you,
Father.

722
01:31:22,750 --> 01:31:25,553
It's done.
Now, let us go.

723
01:31:25,586 --> 01:31:28,155
<i>Oh, Ruby.</i>

724
01:31:28,189 --> 01:31:31,025
<i>You can never leave.</i>

725
01:31:31,058 --> 01:31:33,561
<i>You are truly</i>

726
01:31:33,594 --> 01:31:36,998
<i>one of us.</i>

727
01:31:37,898 --> 01:31:39,633
Then let Roy go.

728
01:31:41,335 --> 01:31:43,571
<i>No.</i>

729
01:31:43,604 --> 01:31:47,708
<i>Roy is just as guilty</i>
<i>as the rest.</i>

730
01:31:48,743 --> 01:31:50,611
We had a deal.

731
01:31:50,644 --> 01:31:53,014
<i>No, Ruby.</i>

732
01:31:53,047 --> 01:31:57,084
<i>You never even had</i>
<i>a choice.</i>

733
01:32:09,830 --> 01:32:11,132
Let us go.

734
01:32:11,165 --> 01:32:13,634
Let him go, God damn it.

735
01:32:13,667 --> 01:32:16,704
<i>Ruby, I'm afraid</i>

736
01:32:16,737 --> 01:32:20,041
<i>you just don't understand.</i>

737
01:32:41,796 --> 01:32:44,732
<i>The Lord giveth,</i>

738
01:32:44,765 --> 01:32:47,802
<i>and the Lord taketh away.</i>

739
01:33:47,862 --> 01:33:50,197
<i>Behold.</i>

740
01:33:50,231 --> 01:33:52,199
<i>I am making</i>

741
01:33:52,233 --> 01:33:55,169
<i>all things new.</i>

742
01:35:06,541 --> 01:35:08,309
<i>Though your beginning</i>

743
01:35:08,342 --> 01:35:12,012
<i>was insignificant,</i>

744
01:35:12,046 --> 01:35:14,782
<i>yet, your end</i>

745
01:35:14,815 --> 01:35:18,786
<i>shall increase greatly.</i>
