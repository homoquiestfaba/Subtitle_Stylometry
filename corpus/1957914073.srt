0
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:52,519
He's home!

1
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,088
Get off! Get off!
Get off! Get off!

2
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:56,289
Out of my way, kid.

3
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,791
What's going on, huh?

4
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,493
Watching Mommy.

5
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:03,597
Suzanne's not your mommy.
She's your babysitter.

6
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,334
I just got called back
into work. Stay a couple more hours?

7
00:01:07,335 --> 00:01:08,502
Okay, yeah.

8
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:14,308
Promise you won't
leave me, Suzie?

9
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:20,548
I promise.

10
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,368
Baby, I have to go to work.

11
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:43,170
- No.
- Yes.

12
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:45,138
- Come on.
- No.

13
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:47,175
- Yeah.
- Come on. Please stay.

14
00:01:49,277 --> 00:01:51,378
I can't.
I gotta go.

15
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:53,680
All right.
Are you sure?

16
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:55,683
Yes, I'm sure.

17
00:01:58,186 --> 00:02:00,887
And what are you doing today?

18
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:04,525
Well, I don't know.
I'll probably work on a new song.

19
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,506
Robert, I gotta go!

20
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,609
Bye.

21
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,844
Hey, babe, can you make it
to the gig tonight?

22
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:26,713
I'm gonna try. Yes.

23
00:02:26,714 --> 00:02:28,348
Mom, I gotta get to school.

24
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:30,883
And I gotta get
her to school. Bye.

25
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:33,287
- Have a good day, ladies.
- You, too.

26
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:38,458
No! Actually,
it's not okay.

27
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:41,228
The anniversary edition cover
story should've been decided by now,

28
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:45,232
and I really need that PDF compiled for
everybody's references immediately, okay?

29
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:47,334
Can we do that? Thank you.

30
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:49,569
- Whoa! God! Mom!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

31
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,771
- Why are you being so crazy?
- What a moron.

32
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:54,807
I'm not, honey.
It wasn't my fault.

33
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:56,976
Just pull over here.
I'll walk with Dougie.

34
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:59,312
Baby, I'm sorry.
I don't want you to walk with Dougie.

35
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:00,480
I'll be safer that way.

36
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:03,216
Sweetheart...
Sweetheart, wait...

37
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:05,519
Please, I'm sorry...
Oh, my...

38
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,857
Ugh! Great.

39
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:15,329
I hate that kid.

40
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:40,688
Style Harmony.

41
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:46,593
Suzanne. A word?

42
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:47,794
Sure.

43
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:50,430
As you know,
you're highly valued here.

44
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:52,565
I think that you're
Harmony's top asset.

45
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,267
Thank you.

46
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:55,902
You're getting an assistant.

47
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,804
Excuse me?

48
00:03:57,805 --> 00:04:00,673
I've accepted your unwillingness to work
alongside a comanaging editor

49
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:02,275
since you took this
role five years ago,

50
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:04,844
but it's time for you to step
into the real world.

51
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:06,913
All leaders delegate.

52
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,916
Thank you, but I really
have no need for an assistant.

53
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:13,286
Suzanne, your stress levels
have concerned me lately.

54
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:16,289
Janet, I appreciate the gesture.

55
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,659
It's not a gesture.
I've already hired somebody.

56
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,828
His name is David Barinas,

57
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:25,832
and he is a former assistant to the
editor of Health and Vitality magazine.

58
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:29,369
As everybody knows, that
woman is near impossible

59
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,372
when it comes to her standards
of who she'll work with.

60
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:34,774
She wrote him
a glowing reference.

61
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,076
He approached me last week.

62
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:41,749
We should be thrilled to have him
on board, working with our magazine.

63
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:45,818
Wow. I don't know what to say.

64
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,522
I mean, can I at least have
some time to think about it?

65
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:51,758
Ah, David.

66
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,926
Hello.

67
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:57,565
David Barinas, Suzanne Austin.

68
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:01,334
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleasure is all mine.

69
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:02,736
I'll leave you to it.

70
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:07,940
Well...

71
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:09,942
Great.

72
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:14,714
Before we get started, I would like to
introduce you all to my new assistant.

73
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:16,849
Do not be shocked.

74
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,452
David Barinas.

75
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:21,654
- Mary.
- Charles.

76
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:22,822
Ian.

77
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,256
Nice to meet you guys.

78
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:28,561
As you know, this edition
marks Style Harmony's 50th anniversary,

79
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:32,832
and I need each and every one of you to
step up to the plate on this one, okay?

80
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,602
It is essential
that we accelerate our social media game

81
00:05:35,603 --> 00:05:40,006
and amp up our online interaction and
really get our readers involved.

82
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:44,377
Oh, plus, I want them to get a copy of
this as soon as it hits the shelves.

83
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:45,945
Understood?

84
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:49,849
And by the end of the day,
Mary will have compiled a PDF

85
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,385
of every single cover
in history for your reference.

86
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:54,721
It's already done.

87
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:56,589
Oh, sorry to interrupt.

88
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,157
When I was preparing
for the job,

89
00:05:58,158 --> 00:05:59,692
I compiled that as my research.

90
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:03,796
Great. Well, that
saves you some time.

91
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:05,932
I'll WeTransfer it to everybody.

92
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:07,667
Perfect.

93
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:10,036
Well, uh, I guess
that's it for now.

94
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:14,140
Oh, and please keep brainstorming cover
story ideas for the next meeting,

95
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:17,744
and I have yet to hear anything
exciting enough for our feature

96
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:19,646
and it has to be
truly mind-blowing.

97
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:22,549
Mind-blowing. Please.
Thank you. Goodbye.

98
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,752
Arthur L. Carter
Journalism Institute, NYU.

99
00:06:25,753 --> 00:06:27,887
And how did you find
studying under Professor...

100
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,590
Wilkinson?
He's a difficult man,

101
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:33,593
but I was granted the highest honor he's
given out in over a decade.

102
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:35,995
- And that was class of...
- 2013.

103
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:39,532
Full-time study accompanied by a part-time
internship at Health and Vitality,

104
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:41,100
along with heading
the NYU Local.

105
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:44,504
Where my job was to ensure
a 7:00 a.m. publication each weekday.

106
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:46,839
I will be available
day and night.

107
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,941
I've already dedicated
to learning from you Miss Austin.

108
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:51,478
Along with climbing
the ladder, here at Style and Harmony.

109
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:53,179
I will do absolutely anything.

110
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,848
- Welcome aboard, David.
- Thank you.

111
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:57,551
And it's Mrs. Austin.

112
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:07,860
Suzanne Austin's office.

113
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:11,564
Hi. This is Callista,
Suzanne's daughter.

114
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:13,065
Callista. Hello.

115
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,067
I'm your mother's
new assistant, David.

116
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:17,704
She's actually in a meeting right now,
but I'd be happy to take a message.

117
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:20,740
Assistant? Weird.

118
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:25,144
Um... yeah, can you just tell her that I
don't need to be picked up.

119
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:27,580
I'm going to hang out
at the Red Hen Coffee Shop.

120
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:28,981
I'll be home later.

121
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:31,984
All right. I will pass that
message right along.

122
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:34,887
It was a pleasure to phone-meet you,
Callista. You have a good day.

123
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:36,690
Thanks. Bye.

124
00:07:38,726 --> 00:07:41,060
- Any calls?
- One. Callista.

125
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:44,564
She's going to her regular cafe after
school and doesn't need you to pick her up.

126
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:46,165
Oh, okay.

127
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,934
Your daughter must be
so proud of you.

128
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:50,069
She's got a great role model.

129
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,172
Must be one big power
family, huh? What does your husband do?

130
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:54,607
He's a musician.

131
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:58,110
Excuse me. I have some errands to run on
my way home. Good job today.

132
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:00,113
Thank you.
I'll see you tomorrow.

133
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,088
Hmm.

134
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,405
I mean, can you
believe that guy.

135
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:30,943
Who compiles a PDF
of all magazine covers for research?

136
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:34,781
Yeah, he's definitely
a little eager, but damn he's fine.

137
00:08:34,782 --> 00:08:38,084
Okay, good-looking or not, there is
definitely something weird about him.

138
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:40,219
Yeah, but you think there's
something weird about everybody.

139
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:44,156
Yeah, most people suck.
That's why I don't like many people.

140
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:46,959
I'm going to see
what I can find.

141
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,595
What exactly are you
even looking for?

142
00:08:48,596 --> 00:08:50,563
I want to know his blood type,

143
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:52,565
the name of his
first pet that died,

144
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:53,800
his mother's shoe size.

145
00:08:53,801 --> 00:08:55,167
And she wonders why
she's still single.

146
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:57,604
Hey. What was his
last name again?

147
00:08:57,605 --> 00:08:58,705
Whose last name?

148
00:08:58,706 --> 00:09:00,807
Yours, actually.

149
00:09:00,808 --> 00:09:03,175
I was gonna friend you online.

150
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:07,680
Hmm. I'm not really
into social media.

151
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,983
Huge waste of time,
if you ask me.

152
00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:14,020
Seriously?

153
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:16,923
Whoa! New guy. Hold up.

154
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:20,059
So, where are you from?

155
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,794
Greendale in New York.

156
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:24,997
No way. I'm from Pilsford,
like three towns over.

157
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:26,633
What part of Greendale?

158
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:28,901
- Right by the park.
- Which park?

159
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,337
- The one with the skate ramp.
- Hmm.

160
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:33,272
I don't remember there being
a skate ramp in Greendale.

161
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:35,642
Well, there was one.
I really have to get back to Suzanne.

162
00:09:35,643 --> 00:09:37,777
Yeah, of course.
Hey, you know,

163
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:40,880
a bunch of us are staying late to
brainstorm some ideas for the cover story.

164
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:42,615
You want to join?

165
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:45,985
I would, thank you for the invite, but I
already made plans.

166
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:47,220
Of course.

167
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:56,228
Oh...

168
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:58,164
Damn it.

169
00:09:58,165 --> 00:09:59,599
Really?

170
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:06,773
Dad, that was awesome.
You were amazing.

171
00:10:06,774 --> 00:10:10,009
They went wild for you
when you played "Suzie's Eyes."

172
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,678
- Thanks, guys.
- Hey.

173
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:15,115
- Hey, babe.
- I am so sorry, I got tied up.

174
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,985
Oh, don't worry about it.
I understand.

175
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:20,787
Hi, Callista.

176
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:23,122
Douglas, are you
staying for a while?

177
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,257
Mom, he was just
leaving. God!

178
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:27,827
- Later, babe.
- Bye.

179
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:29,696
Roberto.

180
00:10:29,697 --> 00:10:31,263
Bring me next time, yeah?

181
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:32,932
Thanks, dude,
I appreciate you coming.

182
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:36,068
All right, Mrs. A.
See you later, all right?

183
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:38,404
Good night, Douglas.

184
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:42,341
It's not funny.
I'm not laughing about that.

185
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:44,211
Hey, honey, how was your night?

186
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:47,246
Yup. Okay.

187
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:50,116
Seriously, why is he here?
Why was he here?

188
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:52,018
What in the heck
are you thinking?

189
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,320
He just came to my gig
with Callista.

190
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,823
Come on, think back
to how we were at their age.

191
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:59,926
Yeah, but baby,
we are the adults making the rules now.

192
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:02,829
Yeah, but they'll just do it behind our
backs if we don't let them, right?

193
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,997
I don't want to encourage
or help them.

194
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:10,069
Do you really want your daughter getting
pregnant with some deadbeat loser's baby?

195
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,739
I know what you're saying,
but please try and relax.

196
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,874
And remember what
the doctor said.

197
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,844
Breathe deeply
from the diaphragm.

198
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:22,248
And I don't know, maybe it's time you
start seeing the therapist again.

199
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:25,818
Callista told me that
you had a little bit of road rage.

200
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:28,955
Driving, yelling at
somebody on the road...

201
00:11:28,956 --> 00:11:31,457
and it really scared her.

202
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:35,461
I know. I know.
Work's really hectic right now,

203
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:37,730
but I got a new assistant.

204
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:40,466
So that should make things
a lot easier for us.

205
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:43,402
That's great! That means
we'll get to see more of you, right?

206
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:45,404
- Yeah.
- An assistant! Wow!

207
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:47,073
I never thought I'd see the day.

208
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:50,943
I know, but, you know,
he's hardworking and ambitious,

209
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:55,114
a little overly confident,
maybe, but it's good.

210
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:57,818
Sounds like it might be
a good thing in the editorial world.

211
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:03,056
- I need a drink.
- Yes.

212
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:20,306
What's this?

213
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:21,841
It's Dougie's.

214
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:23,509
And what's it doing
in your room?

215
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,412
I was taking care of it
for him, which is none of your business.

216
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:30,917
Actually, it is my business because this is
my house and you are my teenage daughter.

217
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:34,286
Honey, he's no good
for you. He's using you.

218
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:36,789
You shouldn't let him
push you around.

219
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,058
You would know
all about that, wouldn't you?

220
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:41,293
- Watch your tone.
- You're such a hypocrite.

221
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:44,330
I mean, look at you and Dad, you guys are
constantly fighting and you still stay with him.

222
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:45,932
That's enough, Callista.

223
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:47,366
You're never even here anyway.

224
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:50,369
So I'm pretty sure you lost
the right to judge my life.

225
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,872
Douglas is banned
from this house.

226
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:55,442
Fine. I don't have to be
in this house to see him.

227
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:24,570
How about a piece
on the cost of looking good,

228
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:27,306
that details how much the average person
spends on beauty maintenance?

229
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,976
Mmm.
That could be interesting.

230
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:32,912
I'm pretty sure someone else
did that a few issues ago.

231
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:34,513
So we do it better.

232
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:36,883
Oh.

233
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:39,585
I swear, one of us better get a promotion
for all the overtime we've been putting in.

234
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:41,587
Uh, yeah, it better be me.

235
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:43,890
I'm the one who's been
slaving away here the longest.

236
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:46,331
I don't know, Mary.
Suzanne's new assistant may have you beat.

237
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,428
After that PDF stunt today.

238
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,530
You never know what
that cat's got up his sleeve.

239
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:53,399
Okay, seriously, who does that?

240
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,633
Way to bring it up
again, Charles.

241
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:57,103
She already wants to launch
an FBI investigation on the guy.

242
00:13:57,104 --> 00:13:59,371
I just know a rat
when I smell one.

243
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:02,541
Or someone's feeling a little butt-hurt for
getting owned in front of the whole team today.

244
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:05,044
- Correct.
- Whatever.

245
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:06,445
All right,
I'm calling it a night.

246
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:08,881
- What? We...
- I've got some cyber-stalking to do.

247
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:09,982
Oh, God.

248
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:11,350
She ain't kidding.

249
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,153
- Peace out, my squad.
- Bye.

250
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:24,630
Yeah, Mom, I'm eating enough.
You ask me that everyday.

251
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:28,368
Listen, I'm on my way home. I'll call
you when I get there. Love you. Bye.

252
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,874
Hello?

253
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:48,921
Aah! Oh my...

254
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:50,924
Oh my God!
Oh my God!

255
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:54,693
Mary, are you all right?

256
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:57,163
- You okay?
- My leg.

257
00:14:57,164 --> 00:14:58,697
- What happened?
- My leg! Oh my God!

258
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:01,000
- Hold on. Hold on.
- Oh my God!

259
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:03,002
911.
What's your emergency?

260
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:05,671
- Yeah. I need an ambulance.
- Hurry.

261
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:07,439
Yeah, there's a lot
of blood. I don't know.

262
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,541
Wow.

263
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:12,011
We're treating
this as an assault.

264
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:17,283
Slashing the Achilles points
to intent to cause grievous bodily harm.

265
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:21,620
What we're trying to determine
is whether the attack was at random,

266
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:26,425
if it was a sexual assault that was
thwarted, or if it was calculated.

267
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,227
Calculated, meaning?

268
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:30,998
Meaning that the attacker
could have been somebody that Mary knew.

269
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:36,202
Does she have any enemies
that you know about?

270
00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:37,970
I mean, no one that
I know of at work,

271
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:40,272
but I can't speak
for her personal life.

272
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,574
Good. Great, okay.

273
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:44,310
Well, we'll be in touch.

274
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:47,146
- Thank you, Detective.
- Thank you.

275
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:50,682
As you know, Mary was
attacked in the parking lot last night.

276
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:54,053
But she's in the hospital in a stable
condition. She's going to be fine.

277
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:57,323
- Oh, my God.
- This is so crazy.

278
00:15:57,324 --> 00:15:59,291
Now we've been
speaking with detectives

279
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:03,029
and they are 100% committed
in catching whoever did this to her.

280
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:07,433
But in the meantime, I want you
all to be very careful at night

281
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:10,369
and report anything that looks
suspicious immediately.

282
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,405
So apologies for our brevity,

283
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:17,243
but we've got to get our cover story firm
and we've got to do that today.

284
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:20,646
So, what have you got for us?

285
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:23,115
How about InstaFamous?

286
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:26,318
"Sophia Reeves' Rise
to Model Stardom via Instagram."

287
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,754
That's not a big enough name.

288
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:32,024
All right. How about, "Liv Daly
the New Queen of Funny"?

289
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:34,726
No, she was on our September
cover last year.

290
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:38,330
I have a lead on a former Real Housewife
of Miami from like season one.

291
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,732
I know she'd be up
for a "life after reality TV" piece.

292
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:44,370
No. No.
No reality, please. Substance, you guys.

293
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:45,538
What about Nora Patters?

294
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:51,410
That girl is a bigger mess than
Lindsay Lohan circa 2007.

295
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:54,546
Well, she just got released from prison
for her stint of drunk driving and hitting

296
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:59,451
a pedestrian, and I actually already reached
out to her reps via my personal contacts

297
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:03,322
and, I mean, I'm pretty confident that I
can get us an exclusive interview.

298
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:06,592
But Suzanne just said
"substance only."

299
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:09,261
Sure, in the public eye
that's a common line,

300
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:13,765
but I feel like there's something inherently
sad about the child-star trajectory.

301
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:16,635
And we all know
what her parents were like,

302
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:20,706
and my source says that she's full of remorse
and that prison life has, and I quote,

303
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,774
"changed her for the better."

304
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:25,777
Plus, I have intel that
she just signed on as the lead

305
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:29,282
for Emmanuel Rivera's new indie, and we
know how that transforms careers.

306
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:34,486
I'm sorry. I know it's not my
place place to pitch stories,

307
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:37,089
but I feel like it's something
worth mentioning.

308
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:40,359
So the evolution of Nora.

309
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,429
- And this could be an exclusive?
- Exclusive.

310
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,864
This could be our feature.

311
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:47,599
I like it.

312
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,870
Her rise of the phoenix
story is similar to ours as a magazine.

313
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:57,809
Almost folding, right, in 2004, only to
wind up one of America's top style mags.

314
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,578
Yes, follow up with this, David.

315
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:00,846
- Okay.
- Yes.

316
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:02,849
- Excellent, David.
- Thank you.

317
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:08,420
Hey, guys. Is Mary okay?
Have you talked to her?

318
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,822
Define "okay."
She's in the hospital.

319
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:13,225
Wow. I can't believe this.

320
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:15,627
- Are you going to visit her?
- After work.

321
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,829
Well, hey, please
give her my best.

322
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,866
I mean, you know, I'm trying to keep it
straight 'cause I'm the new guy and all,

323
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:23,769
but it's kind of
shaken me up a bit.

324
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,704
She'll be fine.

325
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:27,739
Our Mary's a tough cookie.

326
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,476
Good.

327
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:41,287
Sorry, it's taken me
a few days and an assault

328
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:42,921
to welcome you
on board with coffee.

329
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:46,292
You must have an interesting
first-impression of Style Harmony.

330
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:49,528
No, not at all.
It takes a lot more than that to phase me.

331
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:53,865
To be honest with you, I have had my eyes
on your magazine since I graduated.

332
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:58,870
Even from your New York skyrise office at
the country's biggest health mag?

333
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:01,873
Well, it may seem odd,
but absolutely.

334
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:06,545
You know, it's not about the publication
so much as the people behind it for me.

335
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:11,250
And I have been a big
fan of yours for years.

336
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:12,619
You have?

337
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,354
I have.

338
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:17,189
You know, I've always
wanted to be in your position.

339
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,558
I really want to run
my own magazine someday.

340
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:25,231
And, yeah, here I'm just trying to learn
everything, and to be honest with you,

341
00:19:25,232 --> 00:19:28,334
sometimes I feel like a bit
of a fraud pushing my way to the top.

342
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:32,439
But I'm positive that
I'm in the right place.

343
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:36,308
Well, you seem like
you're off to a good start.

344
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:38,977
I started at the bottom.
We all have.

345
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:43,582
My first column was in the Los Angeles Daily
Observer. I think it was read by maybe,

346
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,584
eight people total.

347
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:48,554
Although, one of my favorite
pieces was the "Stranger in a Train."

348
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:51,490
"The social anxiety
of public transport.

349
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:53,325
"Have we mutually contracted
to avoid eye contact?

350
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:59,565
"Or if I avoid it, am I breaking some superior
social contract that I never agreed to sign?"

351
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:02,501
That must've been published
about 10 years ago.

352
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:06,372
Yeah, I was...
I was a shy kid.

353
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:11,810
I spent most of my teenage years reading
and learning about anything that I could.

354
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:15,314
- I was pretty lame.
- No.

355
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:17,849
It's not lame. Your parents
must be very proud.

356
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:21,654
Well, my father was.
My mother died when I was born.

357
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:24,757
Sorry to hear that.

358
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:28,627
No. You have a two o'clock.

359
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:30,762
- You better get going.
- Oh, right.

360
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:34,367
Remind me how I went this
long without an assistant.

361
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:49,681
David, what can I do for you?

362
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:52,384
I was wondering if I can
walk you to your car tonight?

363
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:56,054
I don't mean to sound like an old man,
but you know, I'm a little uncomfortable

364
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:58,257
with you walking alone after
what happened to Mary.

365
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:01,728
You have a point.
Thank you.

366
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,503
- Better safe than sorry.
- Yes, of course.

367
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:16,342
Well, uh, thank you
for walking me to my car.

368
00:21:16,343 --> 00:21:19,411
You're welcome. Like I said,
I'm at your disposal.

369
00:21:19,412 --> 00:21:21,013
- I'm never leaving.
- What?

370
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:24,950
I said, I better get leaving.

371
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:27,018
Uh, get home safe, okay?

372
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:29,288
- Yeah, good night.
- Good night.

373
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:38,029
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, babe. Welcome home. How are you?

374
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,666
I'm good.

375
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:44,536
Guess what? I made
everyone's favorite, lasagna.

376
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:46,071
Mmm.

377
00:21:46,072 --> 00:21:51,543
So it looks like we booked Nora Patters
for our anniversary feature story.

378
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:53,379
No way,
that's awesome. Congrats!

379
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,547
Wait, Callista,
didn't you have a poster of her?

380
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:56,983
Yeah, when I was like, 13.

381
00:21:59,352 --> 00:22:01,920
Well, I think she'll be
an interesting story.

382
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:03,855
She seems like she's
been through a lot,

383
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:07,693
and we'll need a lot of graphics arranged
celebrating her past work.

384
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:10,329
Callista, I thought you
could come to the office for some ideas.

385
00:22:11,464 --> 00:22:13,765
- I'll pass. Can I be excused?
- Hey.

386
00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:16,468
We haven't even eaten yet.

387
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:19,838
And there's dessert. I picked up your
favorite raspberry cheesecake on my way home.

388
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,540
Mmm.

389
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:22,774
Yeah, I don't want any.

390
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:26,077
Sit down until
after family dinner.

391
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:27,746
Dougie dumped me, okay?

392
00:22:27,747 --> 00:22:31,016
So, excuse me if dessert
isn't my top priority right now.

393
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:33,151
Sweetheart, I'm sorry.

394
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:35,954
Now, what do you care, anyway? You hated
him. You're probably happy he dumped me.

395
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:37,589
That is not true.

396
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,658
You know what,
this is all your fault.

397
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:42,160
He would never have broken up with me if
you hadn't banned him from this house

398
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:43,862
like I'm some kind
of 12 year old.

399
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,632
Don't you have work to get to?

400
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:50,969
You're not going to help me?

401
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,605
Wow.

402
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,478
Well, let's eat.

403
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:01,813
Great.

404
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:05,851
Yeah, so apparently he broke up with Callista
for some junior he'd been cheating on her with.

405
00:23:05,852 --> 00:23:07,012
I didn't like that guy anyway.

406
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:13,859
- You okay, babe?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

407
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,428
A staff member was
attacked the other day, you know that.

408
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:18,196
And it's just really
stressful at work,

409
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:21,133
because we have this 50th anniversary
edition that I can't seem to close.

410
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:28,474
And my assistant has
been acting strangely.

411
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:30,175
How so?

412
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:32,077
I don't know.
I can't put my finger on it.

413
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:34,045
He got weirdly close
to me today,

414
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:37,006
and I thought I heard him say something,
but maybe I'm just hearing things.

415
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:40,452
I think he's...

416
00:23:40,453 --> 00:23:42,054
overly fond of me or something.

417
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,757
Well, I mean, come on, babe.

418
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:49,628
You're beautiful,
successful, at the top of your field.

419
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:52,163
What kid's not going
to have a crush on you, right?

420
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:54,533
Really? That's how
you're going to help me?

421
00:23:54,534 --> 00:23:57,703
I'm serious.

422
00:23:57,704 --> 00:23:59,170
Go to sleep.

423
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:00,906
I'm trying.

424
00:24:00,907 --> 00:24:03,174
- Your lunch is at Perch.
- Perch?

425
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:06,211
Well, Nora picked it.
I typed the address into your GPS.

426
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:08,847
- Okay, she knows who to look for?
- She knows everything.

427
00:24:08,848 --> 00:24:12,818
She's probably going to enter the restaurant
via the back door to avoid paparazzi.

428
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:15,087
Great. 'Cause I'm not
feeling photo-ready today.

429
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:21,660
The intent is to focus
on your positive steps forward.

430
00:24:21,661 --> 00:24:24,496
Your life changes, transformations.

431
00:24:24,497 --> 00:24:29,968
And I assure you that the exclusive will
be positive for your image.

432
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:32,604
Great. It's important
to me that we don't talk about Diane.

433
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:34,205
- Your mother.
- Yes.

434
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:36,742
She's a compulsive liar
who uses me for money.

435
00:24:36,743 --> 00:24:39,578
She'll probably tell you
I'm dating some guy in a boy band.

436
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:43,815
I'm not. Let's make sure all
communication goes through me from now on.

437
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,283
Of course.

438
00:24:45,284 --> 00:24:48,186
I want you to highlight
the maturity of my role in "Echo."

439
00:24:48,187 --> 00:24:50,288
I age myself up by 15 years.

440
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:53,792
- Yeah, it's amazing...
- I am on a self-development crusade.

441
00:24:53,793 --> 00:24:55,360
You can quote me on that.

442
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:58,997
Almost killing someone was a wake-up call
for me and I hate myself for it.

443
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:02,438
I can't re-write the past, but I can make
sure something like that never happens again.

444
00:25:03,703 --> 00:25:05,937
I have a thing I gotta be at.

445
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:09,307
Okay, absolutely.
It's good to be busy.

446
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:11,242
Are you sure you don't
want to go through the back door?

447
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:14,180
Oh, you're nobody unless
somebody wants your picture.

448
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:20,118
Nora, thank you so much for being part of
the Style Harmony team...

449
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:23,254
Please. Please. Give a girl some space.

450
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:26,058
Oh, and right side
only, thank you.

451
00:25:32,098 --> 00:25:34,566
- You were saying?
- Yeah.

452
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:37,669
- Sorry. So great to meet you.
- So great to meet you.

453
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,204
I'll look forward
to our interview.

454
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:42,008
- Totally. Me, too.
- Bye.

455
00:25:50,016 --> 00:25:53,920
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

456
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:05,097
Robert!

457
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:08,868
Stay out!

458
00:26:26,653 --> 00:26:28,119
Suzanne Austin's office.

459
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,921
We need Suzanne
in the conference room now.

460
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,890
Janet, yeah.
She's just finishing up

461
00:26:31,891 --> 00:26:33,825
a phone call to her
daughter's school right now,

462
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:35,786
and I'll have her meet you
in the conference room.

463
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:39,631
You okay?

464
00:26:39,632 --> 00:26:40,900
Let's go.

465
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:46,271
At Adeline Rose we promote
freedom, enjoyment of life,

466
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:50,041
not unlike Style Harmony, engaging the
human drive to do what makes them happy.

467
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:52,911
At the expense
of their loved ones?

468
00:26:52,912 --> 00:26:55,180
Well, of course our customer
is not the "loved one."

469
00:26:55,181 --> 00:26:56,815
It's quite often the one
who feels un-loved.

470
00:26:56,816 --> 00:26:58,416
Ah, okay.

471
00:26:58,417 --> 00:26:59,918
Well, correct me if I'm wrong,

472
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,822
but you take advantage of weakness to
exploit the sanctity of marriage.

473
00:27:03,823 --> 00:27:08,126
Suzanne, we're here to discuss
a potential partnership

474
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:12,430
with Adeline Rose and Style Harmony, not
to get into any kind of a moral debate.

475
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:15,767
Our business is grounded
on the scientifically established fact

476
00:27:15,768 --> 00:27:17,836
that monogamy
is an unnatural state.

477
00:27:17,837 --> 00:27:19,905
Affairs will happen anyway.

478
00:27:19,906 --> 00:27:25,143
Our app is merely an outlet for our very,
very large and lucrative customer base.

479
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:29,748
Do you have a conscience?
How do you sleep at night?

480
00:27:29,749 --> 00:27:31,416
Soundly.
Business is business.

481
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:33,919
If that's what you
want to call it.

482
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,387
Perhaps...

483
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:39,257
Adeline Rose, as an advertiser,

484
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:41,259
could launch that discussion,

485
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,696
and Style Harmony,
as receiver of those funds,

486
00:27:44,697 --> 00:27:48,734
could easily draw an argument
about "snatching back" from the app

487
00:27:48,735 --> 00:27:52,103
that "snatches" from morality.

488
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:56,441
I think this would draw
a lot of attention to both Style Harmony

489
00:27:56,442 --> 00:27:59,410
and to Adeline Rose.

490
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:00,879
Ladies?

491
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,347
Works for me.

492
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:04,050
I look forward
to working with you.

493
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:13,291
Dad?

494
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:14,927
Hey.

495
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:21,432
You look like crap.

496
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:23,935
Are you okay?

497
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,370
I don't know.

498
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:26,972
I love you.

499
00:28:26,973 --> 00:28:29,741
I love you, too, sweetie.

500
00:28:29,742 --> 00:28:31,877
Is this about you and Mom?

501
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:35,313
I feel like all you
guys do is fight these days.

502
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:38,984
Look, if you're not happy, don't feel like
you have to stay together because of me.

503
00:28:38,985 --> 00:28:42,453
Oh, no, honey.
Listen, I need you to understand something.

504
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:45,123
You mom is the only woman
whom I've ever loved.

505
00:28:45,124 --> 00:28:47,426
She's the love of my life.
I can't imagine it without her.

506
00:28:50,997 --> 00:28:52,865
I love you.

507
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:58,104
I love you, too.

508
00:28:59,872 --> 00:29:01,206
- Uh, Callista.
- Yeah.

509
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:03,408
- The beer. Yeah.
- Right.

510
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:05,244
Nice try.

511
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:10,916
You need to check your
personal opinions at the door.

512
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:13,785
You cannot alienate
potential advertisers.

513
00:29:13,786 --> 00:29:15,921
I mean what happened
in that Adeline Rose meeting.

514
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:18,957
It could just be
so detrimental for the magazine.

515
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:21,426
You know, we're counting
on their ad buy, Suzanne.

516
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:23,962
It was unprofessional
of me, okay?

517
00:29:23,963 --> 00:29:26,865
I just... You know what?
I'll call in to apologize.

518
00:29:26,866 --> 00:29:28,434
No. No, I'll fix it.

519
00:29:30,136 --> 00:29:31,503
Are you okay?

520
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,073
I'm here as your boss, but...

521
00:29:35,074 --> 00:29:37,008
I think you know
I'm your friend.

522
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:39,510
Every thing's fine.
Thank you.

523
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:41,479
Are you doing
your anger exercises?

524
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,182
Of course I am.

525
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:46,018
Well, I wish I could tell.

526
00:29:55,561 --> 00:29:58,163
Suzanne Austin's office.

527
00:29:58,164 --> 00:30:00,531
Hi, Robert. Your wife's actually
not available right now.

528
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:02,567
Can I have her call you back?

529
00:30:02,568 --> 00:30:04,503
Sure. Have a great day.

530
00:30:07,406 --> 00:30:09,007
Any calls for me?

531
00:30:09,008 --> 00:30:10,341
No. None.

532
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:13,511
It seems like you've had
a long and stressful day.

533
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:17,115
Look, I don't want
to step out of line, but...

534
00:30:17,116 --> 00:30:20,252
would you like to grab a drink
after work to decompress?

535
00:30:22,021 --> 00:30:24,123
Sure. I think I need it.

536
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:47,112
Listen, about the
Adeline Rose meeting,

537
00:30:47,113 --> 00:30:50,348
I behaved unprofessionally
and I'm ashamed that you saw that.

538
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:52,350
No, no, no, no.
Don't worry about it.

539
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:55,086
To be honest with you,
I find that concept repulsive as well.

540
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:58,457
I mean, why stay married to someone if
you just want to cheat on them.

541
00:31:02,428 --> 00:31:04,429
Everything okay?

542
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,998
Yeah, everything's fine.

543
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:09,501
Thank you. Cheers.

544
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,539
Mmm.

545
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,341
I definitely needed that.

546
00:31:16,342 --> 00:31:17,609
I thought you did.

547
00:31:20,046 --> 00:31:21,579
You know what's funny?

548
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,982
The timing today.

549
00:31:23,983 --> 00:31:26,584
You know, about an hour
before the meeting,

550
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:31,189
my husband was kissing
a woman that wasn't me.

551
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:35,660
- Life's weird like that, isn't it?
- Wow. I'm so sorry.

552
00:31:35,661 --> 00:31:38,529
A stunning brunette.

553
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:41,333
Beautiful and floaty
like a music video.

554
00:31:47,606 --> 00:31:49,474
You know, I...

555
00:31:49,475 --> 00:31:53,244
I had a girl friend
that cheated on me with my best friend.

556
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:57,415
It wasn't a one-off either. I found out
that they were seeing each other for months

557
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:59,284
by the time I caught 'em.

558
00:31:59,285 --> 00:32:01,419
Sorry.

559
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,289
Ah! Life goes on.

560
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:07,125
Yes, it does.

561
00:32:07,126 --> 00:32:10,595
I don't get why anybody
would want to cheat on you.

562
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:17,735
Really. You are the most beautiful,
intelligent woman I have ever met.

563
00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:21,006
Well, thank you,
but I definitely have my faults.

564
00:32:21,007 --> 00:32:23,541
I am not a perfect
wife or mother.

565
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:26,111
I work a lot, probably too much.

566
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:30,449
And I have a little, little bit
of a temper. Little one.

567
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:35,954
Well, faults and all,
I would never cheat on you.

568
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:40,291
- Thanks.
- Really, I mean, you know,

569
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:45,630
it's tough to balance work
and family and a relationship.

570
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:47,532
And the anger thing,
that's manageable.

571
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:50,568
It's actually not your fault.
It's a chemical imbalance.

572
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:53,371
Have you ever thought
of seeing a therapist?

573
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:55,373
I saw a therapist.

574
00:32:55,374 --> 00:32:58,043
I thought it was working,
but I don't know.

575
00:32:58,044 --> 00:33:01,346
I mean, the more I go,
the more I feel like I need it.

576
00:33:01,347 --> 00:33:05,651
Well, stick with it.
Therapy takes time, but it's worthwhile.

577
00:33:08,354 --> 00:33:11,189
Where'd you get all this wisdom?

578
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:14,092
The whiskey.

579
00:33:14,093 --> 00:33:15,627
You know what relieves stress?

580
00:33:16,762 --> 00:33:18,230
Whiskey.

581
00:33:19,365 --> 00:33:20,799
And sex.

582
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:26,205
Excuse me,
can I get another one?

583
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:57,103
You're beautiful.

584
00:34:06,445 --> 00:34:08,114
This is wrong.

585
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:02,760
Good morning.

586
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:05,230
You've got a breakfast meeting with
GlamCrew regarding their feature,

587
00:36:05,231 --> 00:36:07,898
followed by a luncheon
with the head of Capri Equities.

588
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:11,770
I've got the office shower
running, it should be perfect by now.

589
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,575
Last night was a mistake.
I have to go home.

590
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:19,778
Reschedule my meetings
for this morning.

591
00:36:39,965 --> 00:36:41,732
Where the hell have you been?

592
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:43,000
None of your business.

593
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:44,569
I'm serious, Suzanne.
Where were you?

594
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:46,271
Kissing random strangers.

595
00:36:46,272 --> 00:36:48,273
That's not funny.

596
00:36:48,274 --> 00:36:50,641
If you love me, you wouldn't keep
cheating on me with that hippie whore.

597
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:53,744
Suzanne, what the hell
are you talking about?

598
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:56,847
Tell me, Robert. Tell me how long
have you been seeing her this time?

599
00:36:56,848 --> 00:36:59,317
- Who, Ellie?
- Yes.

600
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:00,851
I saw you kissing her yesterday.

601
00:37:00,852 --> 00:37:02,620
Oh, come on,
I didn't kiss her, she kissed me.

602
00:37:02,621 --> 00:37:04,555
Oh, God! You're lying! Stop!

603
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,457
Okay, you are incapable
of telling me the truth.

604
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:08,726
How can we move on
if you keep reliving the past?

605
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:11,596
Because you're the one
who keeps making the same mistake.

606
00:37:11,597 --> 00:37:14,399
I can't trust you anymore.
I want a divorce.

607
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,402
No. We are not getting divorced,
please don't walk away from me.

608
00:37:17,403 --> 00:37:19,304
It's over, Robert.

609
00:37:19,305 --> 00:37:20,839
Are you seeing someone else?

610
00:37:22,674 --> 00:37:26,477
Okay, look, I know I haven't
been the most faithful husband,

611
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:28,546
but I love you
and I believe in us.

612
00:37:28,547 --> 00:37:30,815
Yeah, well, actions
speak louder than words.

613
00:37:30,816 --> 00:37:33,984
Oh, my God, Stop fighting!

614
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:35,886
I will go to therapy.

615
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:37,988
You hate therapy.

616
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:41,025
I'm serious this time, Suzanne. I will
make the appointment. I will go everyday.

617
00:37:41,026 --> 00:37:42,761
We can go together everyday.

618
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:47,299
I gotta get to school.

619
00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:53,472
Please, I will do anything.

620
00:37:55,341 --> 00:37:57,309
You need to get
your daughter to school.

621
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:09,355
Just installing some
anti-viral software.

622
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:14,659
I'm transferring you
to another desk.

623
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:17,628
Completely unnecessary.
We're two consenting adults,

624
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:19,764
and I had an amazing
time with you last night,

625
00:38:19,765 --> 00:38:22,032
should you ever be in need
of my services again.

626
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:27,004
Don't be absurd. It's absolutely
inappropriate for us to be working together.

627
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:29,408
I'm making arrangements for you
in the fashion department.

628
00:38:32,378 --> 00:38:33,911
No.

629
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:35,079
Excuse me?

630
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,047
I'm opting to stay
as your assistant.

631
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:40,084
- I didn't give you a choice.
- Then I'll give you one.

632
00:38:40,085 --> 00:38:43,789
Move me, and I'll make sure
that everybody's aware of your reasoning.

633
00:38:45,391 --> 00:38:48,526
And it will be your
word against mine.

634
00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:50,862
Oh, what's this?

635
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,702
Bad, bad boy.

636
00:38:59,438 --> 00:39:00,839
Screw you.

637
00:39:06,378 --> 00:39:08,779
So when are you going to end
things with Robert?

638
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,383
'Cause I know that
he hasn't been faithful to you.

639
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:16,421
I'd appreciate it
if you left my office.

640
00:39:16,422 --> 00:39:18,056
I have work to do.

641
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:50,589
- What?
- I've got Nora Patters on line three for you.

642
00:39:58,697 --> 00:40:00,698
Hi, there, Nora.

643
00:40:00,699 --> 00:40:03,934
Just give me a moment.
I'm pulling up the document,

644
00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:08,506
so we can confirm our interview
context for your cover story.

645
00:40:08,507 --> 00:40:11,076
Okay, here it is.

646
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:13,779
Uh...

647
00:40:15,781 --> 00:40:17,515
Uh...

648
00:40:17,516 --> 00:40:19,917
The first topic...

649
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:21,952
The first topic...

650
00:40:21,953 --> 00:40:26,223
we'd like to address
is your recent exit from jail,

651
00:40:26,224 --> 00:40:31,929
and how you felt stepping out into the
public for the first time? Okay?

652
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:35,866
Great, and then we'd
like to get into, um...

653
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:41,539
into how you overcame the difficult step
from childhood stardom to...

654
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,642
potential Oscar fame.

655
00:40:50,215 --> 00:40:53,684
Did you delete
my interview outline content?

656
00:40:53,685 --> 00:40:55,185
I'm sorry. What?

657
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:57,788
Did you delete contents
from the document

658
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:00,725
that I prepared for my interview
with Nora Patters?

659
00:41:00,726 --> 00:41:04,028
No. No. I have no idea
what you're talking about.

660
00:41:04,029 --> 00:41:06,030
No? 'Cause I'm pretty sure
it was there

661
00:41:06,031 --> 00:41:08,699
in perfect condition before
you got on my computer.

662
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,602
Please, keep your
voice down with me.

663
00:41:11,603 --> 00:41:14,004
I mean, I'm sensing
some anger in your tone.

664
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:17,208
Oh, I'll raise my voice,
all right, you little twit!

665
00:41:19,244 --> 00:41:22,179
I know you're lying to me.

666
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:25,215
You ruined my call and you almost
embarrassed me in front of a client.

667
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:27,718
Just who the hell do you
think you're messing with?

668
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:29,721
I will end you, do you hear me?

669
00:41:31,056 --> 00:41:32,924
End you.

670
00:41:54,613 --> 00:41:56,147
God.

671
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:11,797
David.

672
00:42:13,298 --> 00:42:15,933
That was highly
inappropriate behavior by Suzanne.

673
00:42:15,934 --> 00:42:18,035
I want to apologize.

674
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:21,105
It's totally okay. She's under a lot
of stress. I can't take it personally.

675
00:42:21,106 --> 00:42:23,808
Has she behaved aggressively
toward you before?

676
00:42:23,809 --> 00:42:25,776
No, no, no, of course not.

677
00:42:25,777 --> 00:42:26,912
David?

678
00:42:28,947 --> 00:42:31,616
Okay, yes, a couple of times,

679
00:42:31,617 --> 00:42:34,185
but please don't say
anything to her, it'll only make it worse.

680
00:42:35,353 --> 00:42:37,622
I understand.

681
00:42:37,623 --> 00:42:41,191
I'm committed to maintaining a healthy
workplace, so I will sort it out.

682
00:42:41,192 --> 00:42:42,928
I will sort it out, David.

683
00:43:02,981 --> 00:43:05,984
Callista, sweetheart, hi.

684
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:12,990
Listen, I know you're
not my biggest fan right now,

685
00:43:12,991 --> 00:43:15,192
but I just...

686
00:43:15,193 --> 00:43:18,897
I wanted to let you know
the offer to intern here is still open.

687
00:43:20,766 --> 00:43:23,034
I could really use
an ally here right now.

688
00:43:24,903 --> 00:43:27,137
Anyway, I hope your
day at school is good.

689
00:43:27,138 --> 00:43:30,808
Just... call me when you can.

690
00:43:30,809 --> 00:43:32,744
I love you, honey.

691
00:43:45,056 --> 00:43:47,858
That's very Rembrandt.

692
00:43:47,859 --> 00:43:51,128
Oh, thanks.

693
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:54,231
He's actually one of my
biggest inspirations.

694
00:43:54,232 --> 00:43:56,734
Well, you're doing him an honor.

695
00:43:56,735 --> 00:43:58,836
Very talented.

696
00:43:58,837 --> 00:44:00,405
Thank you.

697
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:09,714
So, how do you know about art?

698
00:44:09,715 --> 00:44:11,682
Oh, I don't really.

699
00:44:11,683 --> 00:44:14,952
Just working for a magazine,
you learn new things.

700
00:44:14,953 --> 00:44:17,688
You work for a magazine?
Which one?

701
00:44:17,689 --> 00:44:19,691
Oh, it's called Style Harmony.

702
00:44:21,893 --> 00:44:23,728
I didn't know that
would be up your alley.

703
00:44:23,729 --> 00:44:25,930
No, it's not. It's...

704
00:44:25,931 --> 00:44:28,866
It's just that my mom
works there.

705
00:44:28,867 --> 00:44:30,301
She's the managing editor.

706
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:34,239
Your mom's Suzanne Austin?

707
00:44:35,473 --> 00:44:38,042
Wait. So you must be Callista?

708
00:44:38,043 --> 00:44:39,977
Oh, how do you know that?

709
00:44:39,978 --> 00:44:42,112
Sorry, that probably
sounds weird.

710
00:44:42,113 --> 00:44:43,914
We actually spoke on the phone.

711
00:44:43,915 --> 00:44:46,450
I'm David, Suzanne's assistant.

712
00:44:46,451 --> 00:44:49,386
Oh! Wow!

713
00:44:49,387 --> 00:44:51,956
I'm sorry, you're just
not what I pictured.

714
00:44:51,957 --> 00:44:53,258
What did you picture?

715
00:44:54,726 --> 00:44:56,126
I don't know.

716
00:44:56,127 --> 00:44:59,997
Balding, dorky guy
with Harry Potter glasses?

717
00:44:59,998 --> 00:45:01,999
No, no, no, no, not at all.

718
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,500
Probably a little bit.

719
00:45:03,501 --> 00:45:05,904
Okay, a little bit.

720
00:45:08,506 --> 00:45:11,877
Wow, you look so much
like your mother.

721
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,815
It's a compliment.

722
00:45:18,416 --> 00:45:19,818
Thanks.

723
00:45:21,787 --> 00:45:23,453
Can I... Can I
look at your work?

724
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:25,290
Yeah, sure.

725
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:32,863
You know, we're having a hard time figuring out
the graphics for the new anniversary edition,

726
00:45:32,864 --> 00:45:38,068
and you're really talented. You should
think about interning at Style Harmony.

727
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:41,105
Maybe you can help us out.
Provide some fresh ideas.

728
00:45:41,106 --> 00:45:43,774
Hey, Curtis?

729
00:45:43,775 --> 00:45:45,442
Curtis, I know you, right?

730
00:45:45,443 --> 00:45:48,946
I'm sorry, I think you're
mistaking me for someone else.

731
00:45:48,947 --> 00:45:50,381
Oh, sorry, man.

732
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:55,519
That was weird.

733
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,824
Yeah, well, I have a common face. It
actually happens quite a bit.

734
00:45:59,991 --> 00:46:01,959
You don't have a common face.

735
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,094
Well, thank you.

736
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:07,833
You should really think about it though.
It'd be nice to see you around the office.

737
00:46:23,048 --> 00:46:25,549
Hey, you got a minute?

738
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:28,053
Mary! I'm so glad
you're back. Yes.

739
00:46:35,861 --> 00:46:38,028
- Sorry about that.
- Awesome.

740
00:46:38,029 --> 00:46:40,164
- You okay?
- Yup.

741
00:46:40,165 --> 00:46:41,398
Hopping around on one foot is...

742
00:46:41,399 --> 00:46:43,567
- Not easy.
- lots of fun.

743
00:46:43,568 --> 00:46:45,970
What's going on?

744
00:46:45,971 --> 00:46:47,138
What do you think about David?

745
00:46:48,506 --> 00:46:50,107
Why do you ask?

746
00:46:50,108 --> 00:46:52,409
I don't want to start
any drama, but...

747
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:54,045
I feel like
he's hiding something.

748
00:46:55,613 --> 00:46:58,382
He just gives me a weird vibe.

749
00:46:58,383 --> 00:47:01,318
He said he grew up in Greendale which is
right near my hometown.

750
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:03,120
He said he lived
near a skate park,

751
00:47:03,121 --> 00:47:06,891
but I did some research
and there is no skate park in Greendale.

752
00:47:06,892 --> 00:47:08,859
Well, maybe there
used to be one?

753
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,896
No, I don't remember
there ever being one.

754
00:47:13,098 --> 00:47:14,298
Okay.

755
00:47:14,299 --> 00:47:17,134
Well, I appreciate you coming
to me with your concerns,

756
00:47:17,135 --> 00:47:20,170
and I will keep a very
close eye on David.

757
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:23,640
And in the meantime, I want you to focus
on getting better please.

758
00:47:23,641 --> 00:47:26,376
- Right.
- Right. Okay.

759
00:47:26,377 --> 00:47:28,378
- You think you can do that for me? Yeah?
- Yeah.

760
00:47:28,379 --> 00:47:30,181
- Mmm-hmm.
- Thanks.

761
00:47:32,383 --> 00:47:34,118
Do you mind if I sit?

762
00:47:34,119 --> 00:47:35,920
No, no, not at all.

763
00:47:35,921 --> 00:47:37,387
How are you feeling?

764
00:47:37,388 --> 00:47:39,423
Amazing! Clearly.

765
00:47:39,424 --> 00:47:42,592
Oh. Did they get any leads
on who's responsible?

766
00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:46,130
They found the guy's truck,
but it had been stolen.

767
00:47:46,131 --> 00:47:48,265
Oh, let's hope
that they get him.

768
00:47:48,266 --> 00:47:52,369
So, listen, I was thinking, you and I
probably know a bunch of the same people.

769
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:56,140
Where'd you go to high school?
I went to the Greendale Academy for Girls.

770
00:47:56,141 --> 00:47:57,574
I went to Buxley.

771
00:47:57,575 --> 00:47:59,176
Oh, Buxley.

772
00:47:59,177 --> 00:48:01,478
I didn't really hang out
with a lot of guys from there.

773
00:48:01,479 --> 00:48:02,913
What year did you graduate?

774
00:48:02,914 --> 00:48:06,984
2008. I really gotta get back
to the desk. Got a lot of work to do.

775
00:48:06,985 --> 00:48:10,020
Yeah, sure.
Do you, buddy.

776
00:48:10,021 --> 00:48:12,157
Let's hope nothing else
bad happens to you.

777
00:48:37,682 --> 00:48:39,550
What the...?

778
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:43,621
Who the hell are you?

779
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:51,462
Hey, is Suzanne still
in the office?

780
00:49:07,078 --> 00:49:09,214
No! No...

781
00:49:20,758 --> 00:49:25,195
Oh, yeah. I remember.
We were one year into dating,

782
00:49:25,196 --> 00:49:29,199
and I left school early
to surprise him,

783
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:34,204
and the front door was open, and I went inside
and saw his feet hanging over the couch,

784
00:49:34,205 --> 00:49:37,074
and just as
I went to sneak up on him, I noticed

785
00:49:37,075 --> 00:49:40,410
a pair of red heels
sitting on the floor.

786
00:49:40,411 --> 00:49:42,612
Not mine.

787
00:49:42,613 --> 00:49:45,615
And then I saw her under
the covers with Robert,

788
00:49:45,616 --> 00:49:51,555
and she got up and ran so quickly, she
left her red heels on the floor.

789
00:49:51,556 --> 00:49:55,459
And have these
infidelities continued?

790
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:59,596
There was one woman Ellie.
I went back to her numerous times.

791
00:49:59,597 --> 00:50:02,466
Suzanne already knows this.

792
00:50:02,467 --> 00:50:06,036
I put an end to it.
It's in the past.

793
00:50:06,037 --> 00:50:11,208
Would you like to talk a little about the
most recent situation that upset your wife?

794
00:50:11,209 --> 00:50:13,410
There is no recent situation.

795
00:50:13,411 --> 00:50:15,679
The woman couldn't take a hint.
She tried to kiss me,

796
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,814
I pushed her away
and that's all there is to it.

797
00:50:17,815 --> 00:50:20,317
You're lying.
You're always lying.

798
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:24,522
Robert, why do you think
you went back to Ellie more than once?

799
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:27,425
I don't know.

800
00:50:28,593 --> 00:50:30,360
We hung out.

801
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:32,496
We had fun.

802
00:50:32,497 --> 00:50:36,300
She made me feel like
I was needed and it felt good.

803
00:50:36,301 --> 00:50:38,136
Do you feel Suzanne
doesn't need you?

804
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:45,243
Suzanne has made it
very clear that she doesn't need me.

805
00:50:47,245 --> 00:50:51,815
I remember being on a family
vacation years ago,

806
00:50:51,816 --> 00:50:54,151
and I think I didn't do
the dishes or something like that,

807
00:50:54,152 --> 00:50:57,287
and I admit, I'm not
good at that sort of stuff,

808
00:50:57,288 --> 00:51:01,291
but Suzanne said she was going to count
to three and if the dishes weren't done,

809
00:51:01,292 --> 00:51:05,229
then her and Callista were
going to go snorkeling without me.

810
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:07,831
That trip was over 10 years ago.

811
00:51:07,832 --> 00:51:11,102
Do you feel like you're
an equal partner in the relationship?

812
00:51:14,105 --> 00:51:17,874
My wife runs a very
popular magazine.

813
00:51:17,875 --> 00:51:22,846
She makes more money in a year than I can
imagine making in my entire life.

814
00:51:22,847 --> 00:51:25,449
People that don't even
know her respect her.

815
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:27,484
And me?

816
00:51:27,485 --> 00:51:29,587
My most relevant skill
is that I can cook.

817
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:33,890
I did, however, write
a great song once,

818
00:51:33,891 --> 00:51:36,660
and that did buy our house.

819
00:51:36,661 --> 00:51:39,896
But that was then, and now,

820
00:51:39,897 --> 00:51:42,432
I feel like I have
no value in life,

821
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:44,468
no purpose in life.

822
00:51:44,469 --> 00:51:47,237
What about your daughter?

823
00:51:47,238 --> 00:51:50,207
You're of value to her.

824
00:51:50,208 --> 00:51:52,510
Callista looks up
to you so much.

825
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:58,382
She definitely is
my ray of sunshine.

826
00:51:58,383 --> 00:52:01,886
Callista and me,
we definitely fell from the same tree.

827
00:52:03,921 --> 00:52:08,558
Do you ever put time aside for the two of
you to just reconnect as a couple?

828
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:10,860
No, but I think
that's a great idea.

829
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:13,163
I would love to do that.
Date night.

830
00:52:13,164 --> 00:52:15,500
But work keeps her away.

831
00:52:17,435 --> 00:52:20,537
Honey, I work to pay our bills

832
00:52:20,538 --> 00:52:22,407
and to keep living
the way we live.

833
00:52:24,342 --> 00:52:27,377
I know you're not happy, I know.

834
00:52:27,378 --> 00:52:30,814
But the more you mope,
the more apathetic you get,

835
00:52:30,815 --> 00:52:34,718
and the angrier I get and the less time I
want to spend with you.

836
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:37,421
I know you're depressed,
and I want to try and help you,

837
00:52:37,422 --> 00:52:40,457
but you have to want
to help yourself.

838
00:52:40,458 --> 00:52:44,194
And you have to be invested
in this relationship and try to find

839
00:52:44,195 --> 00:52:45,863
purpose in your life.

840
00:52:49,734 --> 00:52:52,302
I will tell you this,
I will not...

841
00:52:52,303 --> 00:52:55,806
stick around if you cheat
on me again, I will not do that to myself.

842
00:52:57,608 --> 00:53:00,611
And we need to set a better
example for Callista.

843
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:05,649
You're right.

844
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:09,220
And I need you to try
and find more time for us...

845
00:53:11,489 --> 00:53:13,758
so I can rebuild your trust.

846
00:53:15,593 --> 00:53:17,194
Please, can we do that?

847
00:53:22,467 --> 00:53:23,568
Okay.

848
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,575
Suzanne. Hi.

849
00:53:31,576 --> 00:53:35,345
I've a list of social media blasts that
you need to approve before I send out.

850
00:53:35,346 --> 00:53:36,680
You ready?

851
00:53:36,681 --> 00:53:38,315
Uh, sure. Shoot.

852
00:53:38,316 --> 00:53:44,020
All righty. "Nothing more grueling than a
fitness session with @JuliaGainsford.

853
00:53:44,021 --> 00:53:48,558
"Our whole office is getting on board. See
her in this month's issue of #Harmony."

854
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,594
- Great.
- Great.

855
00:53:50,595 --> 00:53:53,463
"Less than one month until
our #anniversary edition.

856
00:53:53,464 --> 00:53:57,033
"Are you as excited
as we are? #HarmonyTurns50"

857
00:53:57,034 --> 00:53:58,368
Sounds great.

858
00:53:58,369 --> 00:53:59,903
All righty.

859
00:53:59,904 --> 00:54:02,506
Then as usual, we'll share messages, add
encouraging comments

860
00:54:02,507 --> 00:54:04,708
about our upcoming
featured celebrities.

861
00:54:04,709 --> 00:54:06,543
That all works.

862
00:54:06,544 --> 00:54:08,379
All right. Perfect.

863
00:54:16,654 --> 00:54:19,323
So, maybe you could place
the corresponding images

864
00:54:19,324 --> 00:54:21,591
side-by-side,
vertically instead on the left.

865
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:24,494
So the "I" is
drawn in with the lines.

866
00:54:24,495 --> 00:54:26,563
- Ah!
- That's a great idea.

867
00:54:26,564 --> 00:54:28,332
What do you think about that?

868
00:54:28,333 --> 00:54:30,900
Actually, I like it.

869
00:54:30,901 --> 00:54:33,337
She's doing really well.

870
00:54:33,338 --> 00:54:35,640
Looks like a young
version of you.

871
00:54:37,642 --> 00:54:40,345
I don't want you
anywhere near my daughter.

872
00:54:41,812 --> 00:54:44,481
Well, being as Callista has
an internship here,

873
00:54:44,482 --> 00:54:46,784
it's going to be hard to avoid.

874
00:54:52,056 --> 00:54:53,457
Hey, Janet.

875
00:54:53,458 --> 00:54:56,693
What in God's name
were you thinking?

876
00:54:56,694 --> 00:54:58,328
What do you mean?

877
00:54:58,329 --> 00:55:01,898
Nora got highly intoxicated this morning
before she went on the GMW appearance,

878
00:55:01,899 --> 00:55:04,901
and she spent
the entire time on the interview

879
00:55:04,902 --> 00:55:08,738
ranting and raving about
how rehab was for suckers,

880
00:55:08,739 --> 00:55:13,477
and how her parents and all parents should
just let their kids enjoy their lives.

881
00:55:13,478 --> 00:55:16,346
And, I quote...

882
00:55:16,347 --> 00:55:18,082
"do all the drugs
that they want."

883
00:55:19,784 --> 00:55:21,451
Oh, my God.

884
00:55:21,452 --> 00:55:23,720
And we endorsed her!

885
00:55:23,721 --> 00:55:26,357
How in the world could you
let a tweet go out like that?

886
00:55:27,492 --> 00:55:29,794
You have got to be kidding me!

887
00:55:33,731 --> 00:55:36,800
- You know what, kids?
- Do whatever the you want.

888
00:55:36,801 --> 00:55:39,837
All the drugs you want, anything.

889
00:55:41,005 --> 00:55:45,442
Whatever puts a smile
on your dial.

890
00:55:45,443 --> 00:55:48,077
Cocaine? Yummy.

891
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:50,079
Alcohol! Yay!

892
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,617
I say, get the party started.

893
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:57,086
You let tweets
go out unapproved?

894
00:55:57,087 --> 00:56:00,990
No, I approved them remotely.

895
00:56:00,991 --> 00:56:03,760
It's your job to be
on top of this kind of thing Suzanne.

896
00:56:03,761 --> 00:56:05,496
Fix it!

897
00:56:09,934 --> 00:56:11,535
You did this!

898
00:56:11,536 --> 00:56:13,737
- Mom.
- Callista!

899
00:56:13,738 --> 00:56:16,806
Well, you approved it. I told you
on the phone along with the others.

900
00:56:16,807 --> 00:56:18,575
I thought you wanted
it to go out.

901
00:56:18,576 --> 00:56:21,144
Why would I approve
something like that?

902
00:56:21,145 --> 00:56:23,447
I don't know.

903
00:56:23,448 --> 00:56:25,449
You're right. I messed up,
I'm going to fix it.

904
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:27,717
I'm going to prepare a statement
of defense right now.

905
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:28,985
No. No.

906
00:56:28,986 --> 00:56:30,888
- Mom!
- Callista, please.

907
00:56:32,623 --> 00:56:34,959
Callista! Callista!

908
00:56:39,163 --> 00:56:43,032
You have done enough already.

909
00:56:43,033 --> 00:56:47,971
Never in my history as an editor have I
done anything remotely inappropriate

910
00:56:47,972 --> 00:56:51,475
or irresponsible when
it comes to what I promote.

911
00:56:51,476 --> 00:56:54,911
Especially, when it comes
to drugs and teenagers.

912
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:57,548
Are you kidding me?
It goes against my ethics!

913
00:56:58,816 --> 00:57:00,817
And why?

914
00:57:00,818 --> 00:57:02,786
Why would I approve
something like that,

915
00:57:02,787 --> 00:57:04,789
if I knew what she had said.

916
00:57:06,591 --> 00:57:11,661
And why didn't you tell me
Nora was drunk at GMW?

917
00:57:11,662 --> 00:57:14,731
Well, I thought you'd seen
the interview.

918
00:57:14,732 --> 00:57:17,568
It's on your schedule
to watch it every morning.

919
00:57:19,003 --> 00:57:21,138
You knew where
I was this morning.

920
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:24,509
You knew. You...

921
00:57:25,676 --> 00:57:27,044
Oh, my God!

922
00:57:38,055 --> 00:57:39,856
I'm sorry you had to see that.

923
00:57:39,857 --> 00:57:41,725
I'm sorry she flipped out
on you like that.

924
00:57:41,726 --> 00:57:43,527
No, no, no, it's fine.

925
00:57:43,528 --> 00:57:47,063
It's a stressful environment
and this is a big issue.

926
00:57:47,064 --> 00:57:48,833
She's the same at home,
believe me.

927
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:51,569
She gets mad at you
like that at home?

928
00:57:53,003 --> 00:57:54,104
Sometimes.

929
00:57:55,172 --> 00:57:56,641
And with my dad.

930
00:57:58,042 --> 00:57:59,776
Oh, I'm sorry.

931
00:57:59,777 --> 00:58:01,678
You okay?

932
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:03,947
Yeah, thanks.

933
00:58:03,948 --> 00:58:05,516
Oh, Dad!

934
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:08,686
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hey.

935
00:58:09,954 --> 00:58:11,888
You must me Mr. Austin.

936
00:58:11,889 --> 00:58:13,189
It's a pleasure
to meet you, sir.

937
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:15,024
I'm David, Suzanne's assistant.

938
00:58:15,025 --> 00:58:17,093
Yeah, I believe Suzanne
has mentioned you.

939
00:58:17,094 --> 00:58:18,796
Well, all good things I hope.

940
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:21,798
You ready to go
home, sweetheart?

941
00:58:21,799 --> 00:58:23,633
- Yeah.
- Nice to meet you, man.

942
00:58:23,634 --> 00:58:25,769
You, too, sir.

943
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:26,971
Good job today.

944
00:58:28,773 --> 00:58:30,007
Bye.

945
00:58:40,818 --> 00:58:44,253
I don't need to tell you how disappointed
I am in your performance just now, Suzanne.

946
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:47,323
I mean, in front of the entire office and
your teenage daughter.

947
00:58:47,324 --> 00:58:50,728
I mean, David's barely been
here a month and you tore him to shreds.

948
00:58:52,329 --> 00:58:55,599
I don't want to sound like
I'm making excuses, but David...

949
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:58,535
David? Don't blame your
assistant, Suzanne.

950
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:01,872
I think David's doing
this to me on purpose.

951
00:59:03,173 --> 00:59:04,207
Doing what?

952
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:07,010
Everything. Setting me up.
Pushing my buttons.

953
00:59:07,011 --> 00:59:08,344
I don't know,
but I'm telling you, Janet.

954
00:59:08,345 --> 00:59:11,148
What reason would
he have to behave like that?

955
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:17,921
I don't know.

956
00:59:17,922 --> 00:59:19,823
All right.

957
00:59:19,824 --> 00:59:22,424
Then I'd like you to consider
that possibly you're over-analyzing.

958
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:29,666
We have bigger problems now.

959
00:59:29,667 --> 00:59:31,968
Yes, we have,

960
00:59:31,969 --> 00:59:35,905
and I've thought of a way
to rectify this.

961
00:59:35,906 --> 00:59:40,777
We run a piece that promotes a better understanding
of people with substance abuse problems,

962
00:59:40,778 --> 00:59:43,747
featuring a plethora
of recovered celebrities

963
00:59:43,748 --> 00:59:45,348
that can shed some light
on Nora's behavior.

964
00:59:45,349 --> 00:59:47,684
Now I don't condone
her behavior.

965
00:59:47,685 --> 00:59:50,019
But we need to understand
that this is an illness,

966
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:52,321
and often times,
it's not their fault.

967
00:59:52,322 --> 00:59:54,925
It's a chemical imbalance.

968
00:59:56,761 --> 00:59:58,195
That could actually work.

969
01:00:02,166 --> 01:00:04,768
Regardless, I need you
to take some time off.

970
01:00:04,769 --> 01:00:07,771
What? For this one thing?
It's so easy to fix.

971
01:00:07,772 --> 01:00:10,139
No, Suzanne, not over
this one issue.

972
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:11,775
You've had numerous outbursts.

973
01:00:11,776 --> 01:00:14,711
I've had complaints
from staff members.

974
01:00:14,712 --> 01:00:17,313
You need to take some time for yourself
and you need to get your anger issues

975
01:00:17,314 --> 01:00:19,950
and your stress levels
under control.

976
01:00:22,086 --> 01:00:26,723
I've already arranged for Amber Barnett
to replace you while you're gone.

977
01:00:26,724 --> 01:00:28,893
The lead editor of Lolene?

978
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:33,931
Wow! I guess you've already
made up your mind.

979
01:00:37,902 --> 01:00:39,368
Detective Westwood
is here to see you.

980
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:41,271
Thank you, David.

981
01:00:43,173 --> 01:00:44,908
Detective.

982
01:00:44,909 --> 01:00:46,711
Why don't you stay here?

983
01:00:49,179 --> 01:00:52,448
Mary O'Connor was found
dead in her apartment this morning.

984
01:00:52,449 --> 01:00:54,151
Oh, my God.

985
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:57,054
She was beaten to death.

986
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:03,027
Mary worked under
Suzanne, correct?

987
01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:05,963
Was she a good employee?

988
01:01:08,265 --> 01:01:10,066
She was very good at her job.

989
01:01:10,067 --> 01:01:13,903
Who were some of her
closest friends, in the office?

990
01:01:13,904 --> 01:01:16,472
She was close with Ian Simpson.

991
01:01:16,473 --> 01:01:18,908
They spent a lot of time
together outside the office.

992
01:01:18,909 --> 01:01:21,509
Can you think of any reason
why someone would've done this to her?

993
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:24,447
No.

994
01:01:24,448 --> 01:01:26,717
No enemies at all
that you know of?

995
01:01:32,089 --> 01:01:34,490
Mary spoke her mind bluntly.

996
01:01:34,491 --> 01:01:39,763
So she basically had enemies,
basically everywhere she went.

997
01:01:39,764 --> 01:01:41,198
That was her thing.

998
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:45,736
It's why I loved her.

999
01:01:47,004 --> 01:01:49,005
Would you say Mary
was a good employee?

1000
01:01:49,006 --> 01:01:51,174
Of course, I only
hire good people.

1001
01:01:51,175 --> 01:01:55,211
Did she ever cause any trouble
with any of the other employees?

1002
01:01:55,212 --> 01:01:57,882
No more than the others.
They're competitive.

1003
01:02:00,017 --> 01:02:02,318
Ever have to reprimand her?

1004
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:04,188
Yes, I did.

1005
01:02:05,322 --> 01:02:07,356
Mary could overstep her bounds

1006
01:02:07,357 --> 01:02:10,359
and hold grudges
against people who slighted her.

1007
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:13,963
It's been bit of a rough start for you
here at Style Harmony, hasn't it?

1008
01:02:13,964 --> 01:02:16,032
I guess it has.

1009
01:02:16,033 --> 01:02:19,235
What happened to Mary
is an absolute tragedy.

1010
01:02:19,236 --> 01:02:21,304
Were you guys friends?

1011
01:02:21,305 --> 01:02:24,140
Well, we didn't exactly
hang out together socially,

1012
01:02:24,141 --> 01:02:26,275
but we were always
friendly at work.

1013
01:02:26,276 --> 01:02:28,946
To be honest with you,
I think she had a bit of a crush on me.

1014
01:02:31,048 --> 01:02:33,250
So people think that
Mary was a troublemaker.

1015
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:35,953
Did he make any trouble for you?

1016
01:02:37,021 --> 01:02:39,155
No, not really.

1017
01:02:39,156 --> 01:02:42,391
You know, Mary once mentioned something
about an online stalker.

1018
01:02:42,392 --> 01:02:45,128
She didn't really
go into details,

1019
01:02:45,129 --> 01:02:47,064
but seems like something
worth looking into.

1020
01:03:27,104 --> 01:03:28,604
Enjoying the read?

1021
01:03:28,605 --> 01:03:30,606
You're behind the Snark?

1022
01:03:30,607 --> 01:03:32,475
You've heard of it?
I'm impressed.

1023
01:03:32,476 --> 01:03:35,078
But no, it's not mine.
I'm just a measly contributor.

1024
01:03:35,079 --> 01:03:36,880
And you write things like that?

1025
01:03:36,881 --> 01:03:39,248
Well, I was inspired
by your advice.

1026
01:03:39,249 --> 01:03:41,418
"Write what you know."

1027
01:03:43,153 --> 01:03:45,022
I want you to stay
out of my life.

1028
01:03:47,091 --> 01:03:49,426
And stay the hell
away from my daughter.

1029
01:04:10,447 --> 01:04:12,381
Oh!

1030
01:04:12,382 --> 01:04:14,151
Oh, damn it!

1031
01:04:21,091 --> 01:04:23,026
That was completely intentional.

1032
01:04:23,027 --> 01:04:25,561
Uh, I am so, so sorry.

1033
01:04:25,562 --> 01:04:27,630
Cut the crap, David,
just cut it.

1034
01:04:27,631 --> 01:04:30,600
You know what? I'm going
to have to report this.

1035
01:04:33,203 --> 01:04:35,471
I know you're screwing with me,

1036
01:04:35,472 --> 01:04:37,592
and I'm going to make sure
you don't get away with it.

1037
01:05:02,332 --> 01:05:04,501
I think it's dead now, Mom.

1038
01:05:08,705 --> 01:05:11,007
I've got you a salad, babe.
Come on in, take a break.

1039
01:05:11,008 --> 01:05:12,176
Okay.

1040
01:05:22,219 --> 01:05:24,021
Mary was murdered.

1041
01:05:25,122 --> 01:05:26,456
Murdered?

1042
01:05:28,725 --> 01:05:29,960
I know.

1043
01:05:32,229 --> 01:05:34,631
Sweetheart, you need
to talk to me.

1044
01:05:36,967 --> 01:05:38,968
I don't trust my assistant.

1045
01:05:38,969 --> 01:05:41,370
I do not trust, David.

1046
01:05:41,371 --> 01:05:43,707
I don't get it.
He seemed like a decent guy when I met him.

1047
01:05:45,475 --> 01:05:47,710
Sweetie, you're gonna
give yourself a breakdown.

1048
01:05:47,711 --> 01:05:49,379
He's driving me crazy.

1049
01:05:57,521 --> 01:05:59,256
I gotta get some air.

1050
01:06:00,357 --> 01:06:02,058
Whoa, where are you going?

1051
01:06:02,059 --> 01:06:03,592
Out!

1052
01:06:03,593 --> 01:06:05,195
Where out?

1053
01:06:15,705 --> 01:06:17,373
No, no, no, no, no.

1054
01:06:17,374 --> 01:06:19,008
What the hell is going on here?

1055
01:06:19,009 --> 01:06:20,576
Callista's with David.

1056
01:06:20,577 --> 01:06:22,211
You gotta be kidding me.

1057
01:06:22,212 --> 01:06:23,647
Damn it, pick up.

1058
01:06:27,417 --> 01:06:29,185
So where are we going?

1059
01:06:29,186 --> 01:06:31,087
Oh, you'll see.

1060
01:06:31,088 --> 01:06:33,623
It's a surprise.
I know just the place.

1061
01:06:38,462 --> 01:06:40,729
I don't understand why
you have such a problem with this guy.

1062
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:43,299
He seems like such
a step up from Dougie.

1063
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:45,734
Come on, baby.
Pick up. Pick up.

1064
01:06:45,735 --> 01:06:47,636
Why are you freaking out?

1065
01:06:47,637 --> 01:06:49,305
What is going on?

1066
01:06:49,306 --> 01:06:53,176
I don't want our daughter
in that sleazy lowlife's car.

1067
01:06:53,177 --> 01:06:55,057
All right, what the hell
are you not telling me?

1068
01:06:58,248 --> 01:06:59,583
You slept with your assistant.

1069
01:07:01,318 --> 01:07:03,386
It was a mistake.

1070
01:07:03,387 --> 01:07:07,723
I asked you, Suzanne. I asked you
and you said, no, you lied to me.

1071
01:07:07,724 --> 01:07:11,460
And you had me thinking I was the bad guy this
entire time when you've been messing around.

1072
01:07:11,461 --> 01:07:12,828
Once.

1073
01:07:12,829 --> 01:07:14,430
But this isn't about
you right now.

1074
01:07:14,431 --> 01:07:16,832
I am seriously worried that
David's been watching us.

1075
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:18,501
Not just me, all of us,

1076
01:07:18,502 --> 01:07:20,269
and now Callista is with him.

1077
01:07:20,270 --> 01:07:22,105
You think he's stalking us?

1078
01:07:22,106 --> 01:07:25,074
So you slept with
your own stalker,

1079
01:07:25,075 --> 01:07:26,642
and now our daughter
has a crush on him?

1080
01:07:26,643 --> 01:07:28,144
You're a real class act,
you know that?

1081
01:07:28,145 --> 01:07:29,812
Robert, you're not listening.

1082
01:07:29,813 --> 01:07:32,115
I think David is out to get us.

1083
01:07:32,116 --> 01:07:35,618
Me, you, Callista, and I don't know what
his limits are and I'm scared.

1084
01:07:35,619 --> 01:07:37,787
Yeah, well, I just think
you're being overly paranoid.

1085
01:07:41,225 --> 01:07:42,591
Robert?

1086
01:07:42,592 --> 01:07:44,161
I'm going for a run.

1087
01:08:08,152 --> 01:08:10,687
Damn it. Damn it. Come on.

1088
01:08:12,222 --> 01:08:13,523
Yeah, it's really pretty.

1089
01:08:17,627 --> 01:08:19,595
I better get you home.

1090
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:20,797
Okay.

1091
01:08:32,742 --> 01:08:34,410
Callista, honey...

1092
01:08:34,411 --> 01:08:36,712
Wait.

1093
01:08:36,713 --> 01:08:40,549
I need you to listen to me.
I need you to stay away from David.

1094
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:42,451
He is trying to ruin my life.

1095
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:44,453
Oh, like you've ruined
everyone else's?

1096
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:45,721
He's bad news.

1097
01:08:45,722 --> 01:08:48,691
- He's obsessed.
- I don't believe you.

1098
01:08:48,692 --> 01:08:52,328
Okay, wait, please!
I'm telling you the truth.

1099
01:08:52,329 --> 01:08:55,864
I caught him writing crazy
things online, a website called the Snark,

1100
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:57,833
and I know he is
writing about me.

1101
01:08:57,834 --> 01:08:59,368
You're delusional.

1102
01:08:59,369 --> 01:09:01,571
You're not the object
of everyone's obsession.

1103
01:09:44,581 --> 01:09:47,716
Robert! Hey!

1104
01:09:47,717 --> 01:09:50,953
Thought that was you.

1105
01:09:50,954 --> 01:09:53,756
Listen to me, David, I don't know what
kind of games you're playing,

1106
01:09:53,757 --> 01:09:56,225
if you go anywhere
near my family again, I'll kill you.

1107
01:09:56,226 --> 01:09:59,596
Whoa! Apparently
your family really likes me.

1108
01:10:01,565 --> 01:10:04,833
You screwed my wife and now you're
smiling in my face like it's nothing?

1109
01:10:04,834 --> 01:10:07,503
Hey, hey, it's not
my fault that you can't satisfy your wife.

1110
01:10:07,504 --> 01:10:10,539
I guess one-hit wonder musicians
aren't that much of a turn-on

1111
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:12,542
'cause I had her
begging for more.

1112
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:47,744
Mom.

1113
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:54,650
Can I help you?

1114
01:10:54,651 --> 01:10:57,853
Yes. I'm Detective Westwood.
Can I come inside?

1115
01:10:57,854 --> 01:10:59,422
Yeah, come in.

1116
01:10:59,423 --> 01:11:00,889
Thank you.

1117
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:02,358
Hi.

1118
01:11:02,359 --> 01:11:04,059
Can I sit down?

1119
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:05,828
Sure.

1120
01:11:05,829 --> 01:11:08,797
What's going on?

1121
01:11:08,798 --> 01:11:13,803
I'm here to inform you that
your husband Robert Austin was found dead.

1122
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:16,705
What?

1123
01:11:16,706 --> 01:11:19,375
I am so sorry,
Mrs. Austin.

1124
01:11:19,376 --> 01:11:20,810
Oh, my God.

1125
01:11:22,446 --> 01:11:25,315
Look, it's my duty
to ask you where you were last night.

1126
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:29,718
Uh, I was here.

1127
01:11:29,719 --> 01:11:32,921
I had a little bit to drink
and I fell asleep early.

1128
01:11:32,922 --> 01:11:34,723
Do you black out when you drink?

1129
01:11:34,724 --> 01:11:37,025
No. No, I don't.

1130
01:11:37,026 --> 01:11:40,396
What about your marriage?
Were you happy in your marriage?

1131
01:11:40,397 --> 01:11:42,631
Why would you ask me that?
I was here all night.

1132
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:44,401
Can anybody confirm that?

1133
01:11:46,870 --> 01:11:49,071
Yes.

1134
01:11:49,072 --> 01:11:53,075
Okay, look I'm going to ask you just one
more question and I'll leave you in peace.

1135
01:11:53,076 --> 01:11:55,779
Is there anybody you know
that could've done this?

1136
01:11:56,846 --> 01:11:57,846
Yes.

1137
01:11:59,449 --> 01:12:02,986
David. David Barinas,
my assistant.

1138
01:12:04,988 --> 01:12:06,456
Mom.

1139
01:12:08,057 --> 01:12:11,494
No. There's no way David
would've killed Dad.

1140
01:12:11,495 --> 01:12:13,463
Callista.

1141
01:12:14,664 --> 01:12:16,632
- Callista, wait.
- Leave me alone!

1142
01:12:16,633 --> 01:12:18,367
Baby, come back, please.

1143
01:12:18,368 --> 01:12:20,103
Why do you think it was David?

1144
01:12:21,738 --> 01:12:23,772
I just know.

1145
01:12:23,773 --> 01:12:25,442
Okay? I know.

1146
01:12:27,944 --> 01:12:30,713
Look, don't leave anywhere.
You're probably going to need an attorney.

1147
01:12:30,714 --> 01:12:32,749
Wait a minute, wait.

1148
01:12:37,053 --> 01:12:42,525
David and I slept together. It was a one
night stand and I ended it immediately.

1149
01:12:42,526 --> 01:12:44,960
But I think he's obsessed
with me and my family.

1150
01:12:44,961 --> 01:12:46,930
This is no coincidence.

1151
01:12:48,565 --> 01:12:50,900
I am telling you David
killed my husband.

1152
01:13:18,862 --> 01:13:20,464
Robert.

1153
01:13:22,832 --> 01:13:24,934
Oh, baby, I'm sorry.

1154
01:13:27,036 --> 01:13:28,472
Oh, my God.

1155
01:13:30,106 --> 01:13:31,640
Oh, my God.

1156
01:13:31,641 --> 01:13:34,209
How do you think Suzanne is taking this?

1157
01:13:34,210 --> 01:13:37,480
She'll be hurting. Badly.

1158
01:13:37,481 --> 01:13:39,782
She doesn't deserve this.

1159
01:13:39,783 --> 01:13:42,217
Why was she suspended
from Style Harmony?

1160
01:13:42,218 --> 01:13:45,220
Look, she was under stress.

1161
01:13:45,221 --> 01:13:47,022
I gave her a break.

1162
01:13:47,023 --> 01:13:49,858
I watched her smash
her car into David's,

1163
01:13:49,859 --> 01:13:52,528
and then she like,
went nuts on him.

1164
01:13:52,529 --> 01:13:55,197
I think she even pushed him.

1165
01:13:55,198 --> 01:13:56,733
It was crazy.

1166
01:13:58,134 --> 01:14:00,704
First Mary, now this.

1167
01:14:14,818 --> 01:14:16,786
Come on, baby.

1168
01:14:19,789 --> 01:14:21,990
I'm so sorry.
I just want you to know...

1169
01:14:21,991 --> 01:14:24,093
Get out!
I don't want you here!

1170
01:14:35,104 --> 01:14:38,907
How familiar were you with
Suzanne and her home life?

1171
01:14:38,908 --> 01:14:41,510
Uh... well...

1172
01:14:41,511 --> 01:14:43,880
I know that Suzanne and Robert
were in couple's counseling.

1173
01:14:45,849 --> 01:14:47,816
I see.

1174
01:14:47,817 --> 01:14:50,697
I heard there was an incident between you
and Suzanne in the parking lot.

1175
01:14:51,154 --> 01:14:53,221
Yeah, yeah. Um...

1176
01:14:53,222 --> 01:14:56,692
Suzanne rear-ended me
out of nowhere,

1177
01:14:56,693 --> 01:14:58,861
and then got really angry
at me about it,

1178
01:14:58,862 --> 01:15:01,664
which was confusing.

1179
01:15:01,665 --> 01:15:04,600
Why do you suppose that...

1180
01:15:04,601 --> 01:15:06,301
she had hostility towards you?

1181
01:15:06,302 --> 01:15:09,205
Well, I made a mistake or two.

1182
01:15:11,975 --> 01:15:15,178
Do you and Suzanne have any kind of
relationship outside the office?

1183
01:15:19,849 --> 01:15:21,249
Yes.

1184
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:23,619
Yes, we...

1185
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:25,654
We had a one night stand.

1186
01:15:25,655 --> 01:15:28,023
Silly, drunken...

1187
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:31,259
She was my boss and
I was just seduced by the idea of it.

1188
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:34,163
But she's a married woman...
Was a married woman...

1189
01:15:36,566 --> 01:15:40,736
and she started acting
strange with me ever since.

1190
01:15:40,737 --> 01:15:42,305
How so?

1191
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:49,845
Jealous, anxious, possessive.

1192
01:15:49,846 --> 01:15:55,651
You know, that night she told me that Robert
was having an affair and that she wanted

1193
01:15:55,652 --> 01:15:58,887
someone for her own and...

1194
01:15:58,888 --> 01:16:02,891
I wasn't in a place to have
something like that in my life,

1195
01:16:02,892 --> 01:16:04,252
and she didn't
take that very well.

1196
01:16:05,995 --> 01:16:07,263
I see.

1197
01:16:09,999 --> 01:16:13,636
No, she's not the type
to kill anyone though.

1198
01:16:13,637 --> 01:16:15,672
Thank you for your
time, Mr. Barinas.

1199
01:16:16,973 --> 01:16:18,373
Yeah.

1200
01:16:18,374 --> 01:16:22,712
And please, give Suzanne
my condolences.

1201
01:16:23,780 --> 01:16:26,950
I feel for her and
her poor daughter.

1202
01:16:33,690 --> 01:16:34,924
How are you?

1203
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:40,764
If there's anything I can
do for you, Suzanne, you just tell me.

1204
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:43,699
Where did his resume come from?

1205
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:45,400
Who?

1206
01:16:45,401 --> 01:16:47,069
David, where did you find him?

1207
01:16:47,070 --> 01:16:50,806
He approached us, Suzanne, but you really
need to give yourself a break on this.

1208
01:16:50,807 --> 01:16:55,243
Do you have the initial correspondence? Can
you forward it to me, an address? Anything?

1209
01:16:55,244 --> 01:16:56,779
Listen to yourself, Suzanne.

1210
01:16:56,780 --> 01:16:59,247
Janet.

1211
01:16:59,248 --> 01:17:01,116
If you're not going
to help me, get out!

1212
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:03,285
- Would you listen to yourself?
- Get out!

1213
01:17:03,286 --> 01:17:04,854
Suzanne!

1214
01:17:10,259 --> 01:17:12,161
I really don't understand you.

1215
01:17:42,191 --> 01:17:44,393
Promise me
you wont leave me, Suzie?

1216
01:17:46,830 --> 01:17:48,331
I promise.

1217
01:17:53,703 --> 01:17:55,104
Suzanne's not your mommy.

1218
01:18:05,414 --> 01:18:09,251
Oh, um, sorry,
I can come back another time.

1219
01:18:09,252 --> 01:18:12,154
No, no, no.
Don't be silly. Come on in.

1220
01:18:12,155 --> 01:18:13,222
Thanks.

1221
01:18:19,195 --> 01:18:20,764
Sit down.

1222
01:18:29,405 --> 01:18:31,373
How are you holding up?

1223
01:18:31,374 --> 01:18:35,111
It's just that...
I can't be in that house with her.

1224
01:18:36,746 --> 01:18:38,981
She was so mean to him.

1225
01:18:38,982 --> 01:18:41,516
All the time.

1226
01:18:41,517 --> 01:18:45,254
And now she wants to play
the widow, the martyr.

1227
01:18:47,290 --> 01:18:49,124
Yeah, well...

1228
01:18:49,125 --> 01:18:52,361
sometimes our parents aren't
everything we want them to be.

1229
01:19:03,306 --> 01:19:06,275
You remind me so much
of your mother at your age.

1230
01:19:07,911 --> 01:19:09,312
My mother?

1231
01:19:10,446 --> 01:19:12,881
Pictures of her...

1232
01:19:12,882 --> 01:19:16,852
that I've seen while
studying for Style Harmony.

1233
01:19:16,853 --> 01:19:19,221
I'm going to get you a beer.

1234
01:19:19,222 --> 01:19:21,024
Sure. Thanks.

1235
01:19:34,170 --> 01:19:36,404
- There you go.
- Thank you.

1236
01:19:36,405 --> 01:19:39,908
All right, I gotta wash up.
I'm filthy.

1237
01:19:39,909 --> 01:19:41,510
I'll be right back.

1238
01:20:20,516 --> 01:20:22,118
You good?

1239
01:20:41,437 --> 01:20:44,406
You haven't
touched your beer. Everything okay?

1240
01:20:44,407 --> 01:20:46,275
Yeah, I'm fine.

1241
01:20:53,316 --> 01:20:54,850
Oh, my God.

1242
01:21:00,089 --> 01:21:01,457
Your phone's going off.

1243
01:21:03,592 --> 01:21:05,228
Don't worry about it.

1244
01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:10,566
Well, it keeps going off.
Sounds like it's important.

1245
01:21:12,235 --> 01:21:14,002
Oh, no, no, no.

1246
01:21:14,003 --> 01:21:16,404
No, no, no, no.
It's probably my mom looking for me.

1247
01:21:16,405 --> 01:21:18,374
Sounds important.

1248
01:21:22,545 --> 01:21:26,581
Hang on baby.
I'm coming.

1249
01:21:26,582 --> 01:21:28,084
Ooh.

1250
01:21:29,285 --> 01:21:30,920
Hmm. Mmm-mmm-mmm.

1251
01:21:34,123 --> 01:21:37,392
Let go of me!
Let go of me!

1252
01:21:37,393 --> 01:21:39,928
No!

1253
01:21:39,929 --> 01:21:41,464
Let go of me!

1254
01:21:45,201 --> 01:21:46,568
What do you want from me?

1255
01:21:46,569 --> 01:21:48,537
Your mother.

1256
01:23:02,278 --> 01:23:04,679
Come on in.

1257
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:08,151
Where the hell is my daughter?
You better not have hurt her.

1258
01:23:09,318 --> 01:23:10,686
She's fine.

1259
01:23:11,787 --> 01:23:13,322
Sit.

1260
01:23:15,224 --> 01:23:17,025
Sit!

1261
01:23:17,026 --> 01:23:18,693
I'm not going to hurt you.

1262
01:23:18,694 --> 01:23:20,463
I'd never do that.

1263
01:23:29,238 --> 01:23:31,574
I want my daughter.

1264
01:23:34,743 --> 01:23:38,446
You promised me...

1265
01:23:38,447 --> 01:23:40,782
that you would never leave me.

1266
01:23:40,783 --> 01:23:43,586
You said that I would
always be your boyfriend.

1267
01:23:48,691 --> 01:23:50,792
I believed you.

1268
01:23:50,793 --> 01:23:52,395
Oh, my God.

1269
01:23:53,562 --> 01:23:55,064
Curtis?

1270
01:23:56,332 --> 01:23:58,400
I used to baby-sit you.

1271
01:23:58,401 --> 01:24:01,070
Five days a week,
and then you left and you never came back.

1272
01:24:04,173 --> 01:24:06,541
I didn't have a choice.
Your dad let me go.

1273
01:24:06,542 --> 01:24:09,211
And then I was dropped
into the foster care system.

1274
01:24:09,212 --> 01:24:12,047
It's too late
for apologies now, Suzie.

1275
01:24:13,649 --> 01:24:15,850
You were seven years old.

1276
01:24:15,851 --> 01:24:18,253
How do you still remember?

1277
01:24:18,254 --> 01:24:20,822
Because I loved you.

1278
01:24:20,823 --> 01:24:24,127
And then you left me for
some scum, just like my real mother.

1279
01:24:25,628 --> 01:24:28,630
Whatever your mother did
has nothing to do with me.

1280
01:24:28,631 --> 01:24:31,666
My mother left me,
my father wanted nothing to do with me.

1281
01:24:31,667 --> 01:24:35,337
But you... you weren't
just my baby-sitter.

1282
01:24:35,338 --> 01:24:39,607
You took care of me better than most
mothers take care of their own children.

1283
01:24:39,608 --> 01:24:42,610
You raised me.

1284
01:24:42,611 --> 01:24:45,780
You loved me.

1285
01:24:45,781 --> 01:24:47,516
I know that you did.

1286
01:24:50,653 --> 01:24:55,390
And then, you started having
Robert come over.

1287
01:24:55,391 --> 01:24:58,226
He took the attention
away from me.

1288
01:24:58,227 --> 01:25:00,628
And finally...

1289
01:25:00,629 --> 01:25:02,865
you abandoned me.

1290
01:25:04,167 --> 01:25:07,269
And you haven't let go of that?

1291
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:10,872
All these irrelevant
people have gotten between us.

1292
01:25:10,873 --> 01:25:13,541
Mary, Robert, your daughter.

1293
01:25:13,542 --> 01:25:17,313
But I'm taking care
of that now, you see?

1294
01:25:18,581 --> 01:25:23,918
Soon it'll just be
you and me, again, finally.

1295
01:25:23,919 --> 01:25:26,489
The way it should've
always been.

1296
01:25:27,790 --> 01:25:32,360
You know, it's always
been about you, Suzie.

1297
01:25:32,361 --> 01:25:36,564
You know, I've been searching for you. That
feeling that I get when I think about you

1298
01:25:36,565 --> 01:25:40,203
and every ex-girlfriend,
every lover, every victim...

1299
01:25:42,505 --> 01:25:44,740
all I've ever wanted is you.

1300
01:25:47,843 --> 01:25:49,412
Callista!

1301
01:25:50,613 --> 01:25:52,914
Mom!

1302
01:25:52,915 --> 01:25:54,449
Mom!

1303
01:25:54,450 --> 01:25:57,385
Oh, baby! Baby, are you okay?

1304
01:25:57,386 --> 01:25:59,855
Please, I'm so sorry.
I didn't believe you about David.

1305
01:26:01,190 --> 01:26:02,525
Oh, my God.

1306
01:26:06,262 --> 01:26:08,330
Sick bastard.
Listen to me.

1307
01:26:08,331 --> 01:26:11,199
You untie your feet
and you stay here.

1308
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:12,701
Mom!

1309
01:26:40,496 --> 01:26:43,431
I lost you.
You're going to lose Callista.

1310
01:26:43,432 --> 01:26:46,768
Curtis, I can't breathe.

1311
01:26:46,769 --> 01:26:48,536
It's your fault they're dead.

1312
01:26:48,537 --> 01:26:52,475
Mary, Robert,
I killed them for us!

1313
01:26:55,010 --> 01:26:56,844
- Baby, are you okay?
- Mom.

1314
01:26:56,845 --> 01:26:58,647
- Yes.
