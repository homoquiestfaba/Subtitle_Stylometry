1
00:01:37,721 --> 00:01:43,681
Isla Nublar
193 miles west of Costa Rica

2
00:02:06,017 --> 00:02:07,697
Relax.

3
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:11,259
Anything in here would
be dead by now.

4
00:02:31,172 --> 00:02:33,640
There she is.

5
00:02:33,742 --> 00:02:36,523
The Indominus Rex.

6
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:19,541
- Specimen collected, sent to the surface.
- Roger that.

7
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:22,111
Air One, clear for takeoff.
Begin tracking.

8
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:22,979
Copy that.

9
00:03:23,004 --> 00:03:25,464
- Go, go.
- Tracking on.

10
00:03:36,234 --> 00:03:39,593
Land One, the asset is secure.
We got what we came for.

11
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,804
Coming back for you.
Close the doors.

12
00:03:42,148 --> 00:03:44,835
Marine One, I gotta close the gate.
Get outta there.

13
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,507
Understood. We're heading out.

14
00:04:06,421 --> 00:04:09,468
Marine One, I need to close the gate.
Confirm position.

15
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:12,780
- Can you hear me, are you out?
- Marine One?

16
00:04:13,851 --> 00:04:16,600
Guys, what is that?

17
00:04:19,896 --> 00:04:22,653
Marine One, I am
closing the gates.

18
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:29,130
Seriously guys, I'm kind
of exposed out here.

19
00:04:29,155 --> 00:04:31,989
Marine One, confirm you're out.
Marine One!

20
00:04:32,077 --> 00:04:35,662
Confirm position. Can you hear me?
Marine One, where are you?

21
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,000
I can't reach them!

22
00:04:42,196 --> 00:04:43,649
What?!

23
00:04:46,555 --> 00:04:50,430
What is going on?
I can't hear you.

24
00:05:08,818 --> 00:05:11,083
Throw him the ladder!

25
00:05:15,435 --> 00:05:17,395
Don't go!

26
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:44,998
We're gonna stall! Cut it now!

27
00:05:45,014 --> 00:05:48,005
- Do it, John!
- We're gonna die here!

28
00:05:52,632 --> 00:05:54,616
I said cut it!

29
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:34,954
DNA sample secure. Tell the
boss we're coming back home.

30
00:07:04,676 --> 00:07:06,832
Three years after the
fall of Jurassic World,

31
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,871
the debate over Isla
Nublar rages on.

32
00:07:09,965 --> 00:07:13,746
The island's long dormant
volcano, reclassified as active,

33
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,863
has shown considerable
unrest in recent months.

34
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:19,652
Theologists now predict
an extinction level event

35
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,160
will kill off the last living
dinosaurs on the planet.

36
00:07:23,207 --> 00:07:26,136
Since the disaster that
shocked the world in 2015,

37
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,441
the Masrani Corporation has
paid out more than $800 million

38
00:07:29,457 --> 00:07:33,371
in damages to settle class action
lawsuits brought by survivors.

39
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:36,300
Activist groups have
mobilized around the globe,

40
00:07:36,316 --> 00:07:40,417
in what has become the flashpoint
animal rights issue of our time.

41
00:07:40,473 --> 00:07:42,925
With an eruption
expected at any moment,

42
00:07:42,941 --> 00:07:45,691
the US Senate has convened
a special committee,

43
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,105
to answer a grave
moral question:

44
00:07:48,145 --> 00:07:50,839
Do dinosaurs deserve
the same protections

45
00:07:50,855 --> 00:07:52,816
given to other
endangered species,

46
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:55,402
or should they be left to die?

47
00:07:55,466 --> 00:07:56,880
I think...

48
00:07:56,905 --> 00:07:59,553
that we should allow our...

49
00:07:59,803 --> 00:08:02,506
magnificent, glorious dinosaurs,

50
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:05,865
to be taken out by the volcano.

51
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:11,747
- Silence, please.
- As deeply sad as that would be.

52
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:14,943
We altered the course
of natural history.

53
00:08:16,091 --> 00:08:17,372
This is the correction.

54
00:08:17,388 --> 00:08:19,614
Are you suggesting
the Almighty is

55
00:08:19,631 --> 00:08:21,646
taking matters in His own hands?

56
00:08:21,662 --> 00:08:23,576
Senator, with all due
respect, God's not...

57
00:08:23,584 --> 00:08:25,607
part of the equation. No.

58
00:08:25,623 --> 00:08:29,013
What I mean is that, in the
last century, we amassed

59
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:31,701
a landmark technological power.

60
00:08:31,725 --> 00:08:36,138
And we've consistently proven ourselves
incapable of handling that power.

61
00:08:36,248 --> 00:08:39,068
80 years ago, who could've
predicted nuclear proliferation?

62
00:08:39,093 --> 00:08:40,022
But then, there it was.

63
00:08:40,038 --> 00:08:41,999
And now, we've got genetic power.
So...

64
00:08:42,023 --> 00:08:45,085
How long is it gonna take for
that to spread around the globe

65
00:08:45,093 --> 00:08:47,764
and, what's gonna
be done with it?

66
00:08:48,413 --> 00:08:51,491
It ain't gonna stop with the
de-extinction of the dinosaurs.

67
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:54,382
I'm not sure I know what
you're talking about.

68
00:08:54,483 --> 00:08:56,139
I'm talking about...

69
00:08:56,249 --> 00:08:59,194
man-made, cataclysmic,

70
00:08:59,514 --> 00:09:01,022
change.

71
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:03,240
What kind of change?

72
00:09:03,513 --> 00:09:05,575
Change is like death.

73
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:10,325
You don't know what it looks like
until you're standing at the gates.

74
00:09:31,408 --> 00:09:34,290
As a matter of fact, I do have the
dinosaurs' best interests in mind.

75
00:09:34,315 --> 00:09:36,877
- I'm a paleo-veterinarian.
- Is that a real thing?

76
00:09:37,182 --> 00:09:38,572
- That's a real thing.
- You've seen one?

77
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,423
No! I hadn't seen one with my own eyes.
you know not

78
00:09:40,448 --> 00:09:43,721
everyone can afford to spend
their life savings... Claire?

79
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,698
Hello, hello, um...

80
00:09:49,494 --> 00:09:53,260
Congresswoman Delgado. I'm Claire,
the lead organizer in here.

81
00:09:53,596 --> 00:09:56,556
Of course, but if I can just
get a moment of your time?

82
00:09:57,659 --> 00:09:59,689
Great. Thank you.

83
00:09:59,752 --> 00:10:02,963
So, our mission here at the
Dinosaur Protection Group is

84
00:10:02,987 --> 00:10:05,611
to secure pivotal
funding for a...

85
00:10:05,635 --> 00:10:07,643
That was like 40 seconds.
You're getting better.

86
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:09,533
You gotta stop letting
your mom shop for you.

87
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,027
You don't need to insult me
everytime someone pisses you off.

88
00:10:12,038 --> 00:10:14,857
Dude. I'm a doctor.
Not a telemarketer.

89
00:10:14,874 --> 00:10:17,834
What is your job again?
You plug in cords, right?

90
00:10:17,842 --> 00:10:19,607
It's actually more
important than it sounds.

91
00:10:19,616 --> 00:10:22,014
Can I ask you a question?

92
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,615
Do you have kids?

93
00:10:23,733 --> 00:10:25,459
Okay. So your kids.

94
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,982
An entire generation has
grown up in a world

95
00:10:28,006 --> 00:10:30,631
where dinosaurs are
living and breathing.

96
00:10:30,991 --> 00:10:33,561
But soon you're gonna have
to watch them go extinct.

97
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:34,889
Or not.

98
00:10:35,404 --> 00:10:37,475
If people like you
make a difference.

99
00:10:40,739 --> 00:10:41,739
Great.

100
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:44,629
Yes!

101
00:10:47,153 --> 00:10:49,926
- Claire, it's on.
- Hey, hey. Turn it up.

102
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:54,301
...take preventative action to protect
the dinosaurs on Isla Nublar.

103
00:10:54,356 --> 00:10:56,160
After thorough deliberations,

104
00:10:56,185 --> 00:10:59,849
the committee has resolved not to
recommend any legislative action

105
00:10:59,874 --> 00:11:03,741
regarding the de-extinct
creatures on Isla Nublar.

106
00:11:04,054 --> 00:11:06,163
This is an act of God, and

107
00:11:06,171 --> 00:11:09,194
while of course, we feel great
sympathy for these animals,

108
00:11:09,226 --> 00:11:11,436
we cannot condone
government involvement,

109
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:14,936
on what amounts to a
privately-owned venture.

110
00:11:18,857 --> 00:11:21,614
They're all gonna die
and no one cares.

111
00:11:22,865 --> 00:11:24,153
We do.

112
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:31,759
Give me one second.
Let's get back to work.

113
00:11:31,939 --> 00:11:33,985
Okay everyone. Come on.

114
00:11:37,317 --> 00:11:40,051
- Hello?
- May I speak with Ms. Dearing?

115
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,106
- Yes, this is Claire Dearing.
- Good morning.

116
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:45,997
I'm calling for Mr. Benjamin Lockwood's
estate. Would you mind holding for a second?

117
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,911
Yes, of course. I'll hold.

118
00:11:53,405 --> 00:11:57,703
Lockwood Estate
California

119
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,986
Ms. Dearing, you're early.

120
00:12:18,267 --> 00:12:20,548
- Would you like to step in?
- Thank you.

121
00:12:22,361 --> 00:12:25,009
I will inform Mr. Mills
that you've arrived.

122
00:12:47,756 --> 00:12:49,327
John Alfred Hammond.

123
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,983
The father of Jurassic Park.

124
00:12:51,022 --> 00:12:52,483
But of course, you know that.

125
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:55,303
Hello, Claire, I'm, I'm Eli.
Mills.

126
00:12:55,327 --> 00:12:58,686
I work for Ben Lockwood. We
actually met once, 7-8 years ago,

127
00:12:58,702 --> 00:13:00,913
- and you don't remember...
- Of course, I remember.

128
00:13:00,921 --> 00:13:03,303
- Haven't you run his foundations since...
- Since college. Yeah.

129
00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:04,498
- You remember?
- Yes!

130
00:13:04,522 --> 00:13:07,389
Wow, cool. He wanted
someone young, and,

131
00:13:07,405 --> 00:13:09,905
idealistic to expand his fortune.

132
00:13:10,319 --> 00:13:12,092
And I used to be both.

133
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,615
Follow me.

134
00:13:16,077 --> 00:13:18,069
Let me give you a
bit of history.

135
00:13:18,249 --> 00:13:19,577
This is where it all began.

136
00:13:19,616 --> 00:13:22,873
Before the islands, Sorna,
Jurassic Park, all of it.

137
00:13:22,975 --> 00:13:26,350
Hammond and Lockwood built
custom lab in a sub-basement

138
00:13:26,417 --> 00:13:28,697
extracted the first
DNA from amber,

139
00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:30,518
right beneath our feet.

140
00:13:30,737 --> 00:13:34,611
My goodness! What they
did here was a miracle.

141
00:13:35,634 --> 00:13:38,344
- I still believe that.
- So do I, Claire.

142
00:13:38,798 --> 00:13:40,798
So do I, and I still believe

143
00:13:40,823 --> 00:13:43,424
it matters, what happens
to those animals.

144
00:13:43,643 --> 00:13:47,777
There is something Mr. Lockwood would
very much like you to do, Claire.

145
00:13:47,802 --> 00:13:50,364
You can call it a favor
for an old friend.

146
00:13:50,427 --> 00:13:53,434
We have, a piece of land.

147
00:13:53,802 --> 00:13:56,825
A sanctuary. Protected
by natural barriers,

148
00:13:56,841 --> 00:14:01,575
fully self-sustaining. A new home
where the dinosaurs will be secure...

149
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:04,028
- And free.
- You're gonna get them out?

150
00:14:04,068 --> 00:14:07,169
- You're gonna save them?
- No, Ms. Dearing.

151
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,247
I'm going to save us.

152
00:14:09,411 --> 00:14:12,419
We could both use a touch
of redemption, couldn't we?

153
00:14:13,216 --> 00:14:16,489
- Lovely to see you again.
- And you, Mr. Lockwood.

154
00:14:17,693 --> 00:14:20,301
This was all John
Hammond's dream.

155
00:14:20,631 --> 00:14:23,114
To let these creatures
live in peace.

156
00:14:23,357 --> 00:14:26,817
So, we have created sanctuary.

157
00:14:26,982 --> 00:14:30,763
No fences, no
cages, no tourists.

158
00:14:30,966 --> 00:14:33,177
Just as Mother Nature intended.

159
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:35,521
John said it best.

160
00:14:36,263 --> 00:14:39,216
"These creatures don't
need our protection."

161
00:14:39,434 --> 00:14:42,013
"They need our absence."

162
00:14:44,097 --> 00:14:45,682
When we were young,

163
00:14:45,964 --> 00:14:49,065
we both shared this
passion, John and I.

164
00:14:50,299 --> 00:14:52,033
What fools we were.

165
00:14:53,588 --> 00:14:56,587
Trying to run before
we'd learn to walk.

166
00:14:56,908 --> 00:14:59,423
As all young men do, I suppose.

167
00:15:00,924 --> 00:15:03,314
But, we learned.

168
00:15:03,642 --> 00:15:07,970
Unfortunately in the
end, it drove us apart.

169
00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:12,048
Life, teaches us some
very hard lessons...

170
00:15:12,431 --> 00:15:14,712
Doesn't it, Claire?

171
00:15:15,477 --> 00:15:16,602
Yes.

172
00:15:16,867 --> 00:15:18,062
Sir Benjamin.

173
00:15:18,102 --> 00:15:19,000
Hmm?

174
00:15:20,234 --> 00:15:22,320
My bloody medicines.

175
00:15:22,453 --> 00:15:25,109
- Would you excuse me, Claire?
- Of course, sir.

176
00:15:25,305 --> 00:15:28,156
Eli here willl help
you with the details.

177
00:15:28,656 --> 00:15:30,968
We will save them.

178
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,015
With a gift...

179
00:15:35,789 --> 00:15:37,484
For our children.

180
00:15:37,921 --> 00:15:39,256
Thank you.

181
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,069
Iris?

182
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:48,204
Does he have children? I thought I saw...
there was a little girl.

183
00:15:48,229 --> 00:15:50,025
Yeah, he has a grandchild.

184
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,930
His daughter died
in a car accident.

185
00:15:52,955 --> 00:15:55,814
- That's awful.
- Yeah, I know. But they're very close.

186
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:57,337
Really close.

187
00:15:58,533 --> 00:16:00,290
So, what do you need from me?

188
00:16:00,782 --> 00:16:03,306
There was a tracking system
in place at the park.

189
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,470
Radio frequency ID
chips in each dinosaur.

190
00:16:05,495 --> 00:16:06,266
I remember.

191
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,446
Right, so if we could
access that system,

192
00:16:08,462 --> 00:16:13,016
our ability to locate and capture those
animals safely, will increase ten-fold.

193
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:15,578
We need your handprint
to access the system.

194
00:16:15,602 --> 00:16:18,171
But what I really
need, Claire...

195
00:16:19,555 --> 00:16:20,507
...is you.

196
00:16:20,532 --> 00:16:23,188
Moving endangered species
isn't exactly legal.

197
00:16:23,212 --> 00:16:26,110
But it's the right thing to do. No one
knows this park as well as you do

198
00:16:26,126 --> 00:16:28,125
and we need that expertise.

199
00:16:29,087 --> 00:16:31,368
- How many can you save?
- Eleven species. For sure,

200
00:16:31,393 --> 00:16:35,557
I mean, more, if we can. But
time is against us I'm afraid.

201
00:16:35,611 --> 00:16:38,814
There is one animal,
in particular

202
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,439
that poses a real
challenge for us.

203
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,650
- Blue.
- I didn't know she had a name. But Blue,

204
00:16:44,674 --> 00:16:47,798
is potentially the second most intelligent
piece of life on this planet.

205
00:16:47,814 --> 00:16:49,298
And she's the last of her kind.

206
00:16:49,369 --> 00:16:50,759
She must be preserved.

207
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:54,314
She can pick up your scent a mile off.
You will never capture her.

208
00:16:54,408 --> 00:16:55,408
Well...

209
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:59,173
We thought you might know
someone who could help.

210
00:17:00,002 --> 00:17:02,009
Maybe you can convince him.

211
00:17:42,298 --> 00:17:44,008
Hey, Owen.

212
00:17:47,868 --> 00:17:49,328
Owen!

213
00:17:49,993 --> 00:17:51,250
Oh, boy.

214
00:17:58,473 --> 00:17:59,473
Hi.

215
00:18:00,864 --> 00:18:02,630
Back for more, huh?

216
00:18:03,177 --> 00:18:04,841
Can I buy you a beer?

217
00:18:05,567 --> 00:18:08,567
You mean bring 'em, or we
gonna like, go somewhere?

218
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:18,526
Seriously?

219
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:20,979
I can't believe you
think that you left me!

220
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:23,283
Replay that conversation in
your head, all right? You said,

221
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:25,666
"You wanna go live in
your van like a bum?"

222
00:18:25,698 --> 00:18:29,119
"Go ahead, Owen."
And I said, "Okay!"

223
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:31,416
- So how is that you leaving me?
- Because I left.

224
00:18:31,448 --> 00:18:34,198
- I left you.
- You left, because...

225
00:18:34,463 --> 00:18:37,572
- I told you to.
- And then, I left.

226
00:18:37,643 --> 00:18:40,181
Because you didn't wanna live in
a van on the side of the road.

227
00:18:40,213 --> 00:18:43,259
No, no, no. Because you wouldn't
let me drive the damn van,

228
00:18:43,283 --> 00:18:45,666
- for 5 minutes.
- I'm chivalrous. What can I do?

229
00:18:45,682 --> 00:18:47,884
- You are so stubborn.
- Well. Look at you now.

230
00:18:47,915 --> 00:18:50,228
- You're saving the world.
- Well, I'm trying, at least.

231
00:18:50,243 --> 00:18:52,579
You can't just run away
from everything, Owen.

232
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:53,985
So, you're what?

233
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,008
Dating an accountant now?

234
00:18:56,048 --> 00:18:58,571
An insurance actuary?

235
00:18:58,727 --> 00:19:00,555
Your skin looks nice.

236
00:19:02,633 --> 00:19:04,937
- Dermatologist?
- Owen?

237
00:19:04,967 --> 00:19:06,670
- Does he check you for moles?
- Stop.

238
00:19:06,694 --> 00:19:07,694
Ventriloquist?

239
00:19:07,719 --> 00:19:11,117
- This is not why we're here, okay?
- Yeah, I know why we're here.

240
00:19:11,727 --> 00:19:13,969
Lockwood's little
flunkie called me.

241
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:15,219
Rescue op.

242
00:19:15,235 --> 00:19:18,414
Save the dinosaurs from an
island that's about to explode.

243
00:19:18,439 --> 00:19:20,087
- What could go wrong?
- I'm going.

244
00:19:20,124 --> 00:19:21,899
- Don't!
- I don't have a choice.

245
00:19:21,924 --> 00:19:24,688
- What, of course you have a choice.
- So what, I should just...

246
00:19:24,721 --> 00:19:27,259
Build my own cabin, play
pool and drink beer all day

247
00:19:27,276 --> 00:19:29,564
while these dinosaurs
go extinct?

248
00:19:29,588 --> 00:19:32,213
Yeah. I like pool.

249
00:19:32,736 --> 00:19:34,673
Blue is alive.

250
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:38,759
- Jesus, Claire.
- You raised her, Owen. You...

251
00:19:38,807 --> 00:19:41,541
You spent years of your
life working with her.

252
00:19:41,869 --> 00:19:44,025
You're just gonna let her die?

253
00:19:45,732 --> 00:19:47,169
Well, yeah.

254
00:19:50,216 --> 00:19:52,317
Come on. You're a
better man than...

255
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,177
you think you are.

256
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,724
You should write for
fortune cookies.

257
00:19:59,459 --> 00:20:00,732
Forget it. I...

258
00:20:01,295 --> 00:20:03,662
There's a chartered flight
leaving tomorrow morning.

259
00:20:03,686 --> 00:20:06,662
You're on the manifest. I just
thought I should let you know.

260
00:20:26,126 --> 00:20:27,883
Back up! Back off.

261
00:20:30,235 --> 00:20:32,805
Take it easy. Echo.

262
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,711
Jeez. There's plenty of food.

263
00:20:36,493 --> 00:20:40,125
You guys been eating sugar or something?
You're hyper today.

264
00:20:41,597 --> 00:20:45,448
Okay, okay, back off.
Thank you, Blue.

265
00:20:54,939 --> 00:20:56,884
Did you get that?

266
00:21:04,906 --> 00:21:05,906
Relax.

267
00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:08,749
You're more likely to die riding
a horse than in a plane.

268
00:21:08,788 --> 00:21:11,819
No, I would not because I wouldn't
get on a horse. My chances are zero.

269
00:21:11,844 --> 00:21:14,101
- Planes are the safest way to travel.
- You call this a plane?

270
00:21:14,126 --> 00:21:16,524
My cousin had a drone
bigger than this.

271
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:25,688
Owen!

272
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,790
Franklin, later!
Get in the plane.

273
00:21:27,815 --> 00:21:30,111
Didn't think you were
gonna ever show up.

274
00:21:30,885 --> 00:21:33,205
- This is Zia Rodriguez.
- Zia.

275
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:35,183
- Hey, how you doing?
- I'm good. How are you?

276
00:21:35,207 --> 00:21:37,253
- Good.
- Franklin Webb.

277
00:21:37,269 --> 00:21:39,183
Systems analyst.

278
00:21:40,573 --> 00:21:41,855
Nervous flyer?

279
00:21:41,878 --> 00:21:44,620
Would you ride a thousand pound
horse with big wheels on the sides?

280
00:21:44,645 --> 00:21:47,706
I rode a motorcycle through the
jungle with a pack of raptors.

281
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,440
We're not compatible.

282
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:04,732
Maisie!

283
00:22:11,453 --> 00:22:12,632
Maisie.

284
00:22:14,922 --> 00:22:16,429
Maisie!

285
00:22:19,031 --> 00:22:20,312
Come out.

286
00:22:34,662 --> 00:22:36,333
You silly sausage!

287
00:22:36,358 --> 00:22:37,707
You'll be the death of me.

288
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:40,058
You know one day, my
heart might really stop.

289
00:22:40,365 --> 00:22:41,740
Then what would you do?

290
00:22:41,842 --> 00:22:44,716
- Go live in the forest with the lions?
- There are no lions in the forest.

291
00:22:44,764 --> 00:22:46,256
Your grandfather's
been asking for you.

292
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,131
Really?

293
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:49,607
So you go see your grandfather and
you go straight to your bath.

294
00:22:49,647 --> 00:22:51,568
- I don't want a bath.
- What?!

295
00:22:51,694 --> 00:22:53,709
Queen's English, girl. Bath.

296
00:22:53,733 --> 00:22:55,225
- Bath. Bath.
- Bath. Bath.

297
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,281
Not bath. You're
not a wild animal.

298
00:22:58,616 --> 00:22:59,616
Stop.

299
00:23:04,706 --> 00:23:07,088
- Hi, Grandpa.
- Ah, there you are.

300
00:23:07,307 --> 00:23:09,284
Come over and sit by me.

301
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:12,126
- I've missed you.
- I went by all the way through the

302
00:23:12,151 --> 00:23:14,276
Cretaceous, to the
Jurassic in one day.

303
00:23:14,407 --> 00:23:15,696
My. What did you see?

304
00:23:15,735 --> 00:23:18,836
Nothing but herbivores. There
was one T-Rex, though.

305
00:23:19,126 --> 00:23:22,216
Casualties, of course.
Ours included.

306
00:23:22,251 --> 00:23:23,829
She jumped out of her skin.

307
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:27,719
You have your mother's
wicked sense of humor.

308
00:23:30,696 --> 00:23:32,532
Do I look like her?

309
00:23:33,868 --> 00:23:34,977
Oh, yes.

310
00:23:36,259 --> 00:23:38,485
You could be her mirror image.

311
00:23:39,782 --> 00:23:42,149
Did my mother ever
visit the park?

312
00:23:43,571 --> 00:23:44,618
Once.

313
00:23:44,907 --> 00:23:47,032
A long time ago.

314
00:23:47,212 --> 00:23:49,696
She would have saved
them too, you know.

315
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,899
She would have saved them all.

316
00:24:50,466 --> 00:24:51,731
Claire.

317
00:24:54,739 --> 00:24:56,567
Ken Wheatley. Welcome back.

318
00:24:56,592 --> 00:24:58,443
What kind of operation
you've got going on here?

319
00:24:58,467 --> 00:25:02,217
Mr. Lockwood takes his humanitarian
efforts very seriously.

320
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,115
Where's the raptor wrangler?

321
00:25:05,458 --> 00:25:07,715
Animal behaviourist. Owen Grady.

322
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,340
Hey, Owen. Ken Wheatley.

323
00:25:09,373 --> 00:25:11,935
And you're our,
great white hunter?

324
00:25:12,756 --> 00:25:15,563
Yes, I'm the expedition's
facilitator.

325
00:25:15,665 --> 00:25:18,407
Oh, God! It's hot!

326
00:25:20,122 --> 00:25:22,677
It's about to get a
whole lot hotter.

327
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:51,268
Bug spray?

328
00:25:51,784 --> 00:25:53,143
Bug spray?

329
00:25:55,769 --> 00:25:57,706
The T-Rex should be
dead by now, right?

330
00:25:57,753 --> 00:26:00,028
Yeah, well it's impossible
to know the max life span

331
00:26:00,054 --> 00:26:02,292
of a clone in a completely
different environment.

332
00:26:02,456 --> 00:26:04,448
Take a caveman that
would've lived 20 years.

333
00:26:04,472 --> 00:26:07,549
Feed him prime meals, give him
healthcare, he's gonna live...

334
00:26:07,683 --> 00:26:09,206
Five times as long.

335
00:26:11,441 --> 00:26:13,636
So, she'd be dead by now.

336
00:26:14,378 --> 00:26:15,737
Right?

337
00:27:01,098 --> 00:27:03,066
Bad memories?

338
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:07,004
Some are good.

339
00:27:17,306 --> 00:27:18,852
What was that?

340
00:27:24,911 --> 00:27:26,512
Is it the T-Rex?

341
00:27:33,715 --> 00:27:35,668
I have to see this.

342
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,785
Hey, Miss?

343
00:27:38,192 --> 00:27:41,809
Miss! This area's not secured.

344
00:28:12,478 --> 00:28:14,126
Look at that.

345
00:28:14,946 --> 00:28:17,617
Never thought I'd see
one in real life.

346
00:28:19,672 --> 00:28:21,789
She's beautiful.

347
00:28:32,708 --> 00:28:34,177
Shall we?

348
00:28:47,789 --> 00:28:49,835
Okay! Let's go.

349
00:28:53,725 --> 00:28:57,021
Okay, I'm good.
Viewing system...

350
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:12,859
Come on, tiger. You
know what you're doing?

351
00:29:17,717 --> 00:29:19,834
After you, tiger.

352
00:29:23,272 --> 00:29:25,857
Are we sure these biometric
chips are still transmitting?

353
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,435
Battery would be dead by now.

354
00:29:27,467 --> 00:29:31,654
The dinosaur is the battery. They're
powered by body heat and movement.

355
00:29:31,866 --> 00:29:33,076
Hand.

356
00:29:36,537 --> 00:29:38,365
How much longer until...

357
00:29:41,037 --> 00:29:42,474
I'm in.

358
00:29:45,626 --> 00:29:47,618
There's a large concentration
on the East Dock.

359
00:29:47,649 --> 00:29:50,141
That's our boat. We've already
captured a bunch of them.

360
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:52,133
Without the tracking system?

361
00:29:52,173 --> 00:29:55,602
The big herbivores were easy to find.
Can you isolate that raptor?

362
00:29:55,626 --> 00:29:57,735
- I need a species code.
- D-9.

363
00:30:01,407 --> 00:30:02,837
There she is.

364
00:30:02,993 --> 00:30:05,719
- I'm gonna need to borrow your truck.
- I'm coming with you.

365
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:07,743
We don't know what kind of
condition she might be in.

366
00:30:07,767 --> 00:30:10,641
Miss, things could
get hairy out there.

367
00:30:13,572 --> 00:30:15,159
These are powerful sedatives.

368
00:30:15,184 --> 00:30:17,493
One too many, and she could
have respiratory failure.

369
00:30:17,528 --> 00:30:20,957
Also, I'm not as soft and witless
as your comment implies.

370
00:30:22,064 --> 00:30:24,149
Let's go, Beefcake.

371
00:30:24,275 --> 00:30:26,142
Oh, Owen...

372
00:30:28,041 --> 00:30:29,915
Be careful. Okay?

373
00:30:33,309 --> 00:30:35,355
If I don't make it back...

374
00:30:36,536 --> 00:30:38,066
Remember.

375
00:30:38,176 --> 00:30:40,215
You're the one who made me come.

376
00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:43,433
I'll be all right.

377
00:30:53,527 --> 00:30:56,378
We're not gonna get any closer
if we're riding this thing.

378
00:30:57,644 --> 00:30:59,941
- You should stop here.
- Pull up!

379
00:31:01,574 --> 00:31:03,769
Move out. Look alive.
Stay alive.

380
00:31:03,816 --> 00:31:06,448
- We got your back, brother.
- Yeah.

381
00:31:07,386 --> 00:31:09,323
Claire, I'm gonna have
to track for a moment.

382
00:31:09,348 --> 00:31:11,660
I'll need you to be my
eyes if she runs. Copy?

383
00:31:11,685 --> 00:31:13,018
Copy that.

384
00:31:48,144 --> 00:31:51,558
Wheatley, I'm on a fresh sign.
Wait for my signal.

385
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,506
There you are.

386
00:32:33,543 --> 00:32:36,300
Hey, Girl. You miss me?

387
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:41,401
Easy. Hey! Hey.

388
00:32:42,667 --> 00:32:44,854
I brought you something.

389
00:32:49,931 --> 00:32:51,751
There you go.

390
00:32:52,033 --> 00:32:53,993
That's right.

391
00:32:56,306 --> 00:32:57,563
Okay.

392
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,752
You know me.

393
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,181
Eyes on me.

394
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:16,258
You know me.

395
00:33:17,602 --> 00:33:18,875
That's right.

396
00:33:19,774 --> 00:33:20,774
That's right.

397
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:24,031
Hold your....

398
00:33:26,453 --> 00:33:28,476
I told you to wait
for my signal!

399
00:33:32,507 --> 00:33:34,374
Back your men off, right now.

400
00:33:47,185 --> 00:33:49,044
No, don't shoot her!

401
00:33:56,678 --> 00:33:59,396
Wheatley, you son of a bitch!

402
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:09,852
Owen! What are you doing?

403
00:34:10,008 --> 00:34:11,140
Owen.

404
00:34:20,466 --> 00:34:22,247
You shoot me...

405
00:34:22,575 --> 00:34:23,989
And that animal dies.

406
00:34:24,114 --> 00:34:26,075
I think we have the drop
on you, sweetheart.

407
00:34:26,091 --> 00:34:27,591
She's losing blood.

408
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:29,282
And if I don't treat her...

409
00:34:30,008 --> 00:34:32,133
She'll never make
it back to camp.

410
00:34:41,488 --> 00:34:42,535
How ' bout this then...

411
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:45,191
If that animal
dies, I shoot you.

412
00:34:45,254 --> 00:34:47,409
You're gonna take care of her.

413
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:49,354
Let's move out!

414
00:35:02,485 --> 00:35:05,672
Get to the car, let's go!
Let's get out of here.

415
00:35:10,179 --> 00:35:11,780
No, no!

416
00:35:16,701 --> 00:35:19,497
Wait, are they protecting us?
What's going on?

417
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,536
I don't think so.

418
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:26,286
Why am I here?

419
00:35:30,184 --> 00:35:33,387
Hey, Mills. We gathered the dinos.
Mission accomplished.

420
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:38,205
And just in the nick of time.

421
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:41,348
Wheatley what the hell is going on there?
We're a day behind schedule already.

422
00:35:41,362 --> 00:35:44,104
I want that money in the bank by
the time I get back, alright?

423
00:35:44,136 --> 00:35:46,979
Okay, listen to me.
No more delays, okay?

424
00:35:47,175 --> 00:35:49,643
If we don't get... not
now, Maisie, thank you.

425
00:35:49,698 --> 00:35:53,026
- Mr. Mills, are the dinosaurs...
- I said not now!

426
00:35:56,858 --> 00:35:59,444
I'm sorry, honey. This
is an important call.

427
00:35:59,506 --> 00:36:02,170
If you would go up to the library, I'll
meet you up there in a few minutes.

428
00:36:02,208 --> 00:36:03,208
- Okay.
- Okay?

429
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:05,317
I'll tell you all about it.
I promise.

430
00:36:05,341 --> 00:36:06,504
Okay.

431
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,183
Wheatley?

432
00:36:09,207 --> 00:36:12,636
You get, those
animals, here, now.

433
00:36:12,668 --> 00:36:14,707
I want that bonus.
We got the blue one.

434
00:36:14,723 --> 00:36:18,215
- Bring her to me first.
 - All right.

435
00:37:53,655 --> 00:37:56,756
Hello? Can anyone hear me?
Hello?

436
00:37:56,873 --> 00:37:58,787
Hello? Is anybody there?

437
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:00,928
Can anybody copy?

438
00:38:02,209 --> 00:38:04,802
I'm trying everything.
It's jammed.

439
00:38:04,873 --> 00:38:08,365
"It's a tough job, son. Build your
people skills." Yeah, thanks, Dad.

440
00:38:09,872 --> 00:38:11,223
That's it.

441
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:15,372
Proximity alert.

442
00:38:16,325 --> 00:38:17,981
Something's coming.

443
00:38:18,036 --> 00:38:19,840
Where does that tunnel lead?

444
00:38:20,106 --> 00:38:22,777
Well, it connects to
the rest of the...

445
00:38:23,553 --> 00:38:24,873
park.

446
00:38:28,224 --> 00:38:30,256
It's the T-Rex. It's the T-Rex.

447
00:38:30,303 --> 00:38:31,842
Claire, it's the T-Rex.
It's the T-Rex.

448
00:38:31,867 --> 00:38:33,827
Will you stop? It's
not the T-Rex.

449
00:38:35,296 --> 00:38:37,835
- Probably.
- Probably?

450
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,413
Lava! Lava!

451
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:43,523
Lava...

452
00:38:43,548 --> 00:38:45,834
Deep breaths, Franklin...

453
00:39:01,259 --> 00:39:04,548
- See? Not a T-Rex!
- This is bigger!

454
00:39:15,236 --> 00:39:18,861
Claire, what do we do?
What do we do?

455
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,986
It's stuck! Chair!

456
00:39:39,263 --> 00:39:41,513
Come on! Let's go.

457
00:39:42,465 --> 00:39:44,723
Come on, Franklin!

458
00:39:44,754 --> 00:39:47,300
We made it! Yeah!

459
00:40:07,369 --> 00:40:09,666
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, Claire!

460
00:40:13,259 --> 00:40:15,501
Yes, let's go!

461
00:40:27,991 --> 00:40:29,389
Claire.

462
00:40:30,968 --> 00:40:32,819
Holy...

463
00:40:43,895 --> 00:40:45,652
Run!

464
00:40:46,832 --> 00:40:48,402
Run!

465
00:40:50,019 --> 00:40:51,308
Run!

466
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:05,255
Go! Go.

467
00:42:08,864 --> 00:42:10,363
Get in!

468
00:43:29,595 --> 00:43:31,110
Owen!

469
00:44:22,927 --> 00:44:25,597
We didn't die. We just
fell from a cliff.

470
00:44:25,622 --> 00:44:28,450
We're alive! We're alive.

471
00:44:28,466 --> 00:44:30,786
Franklin, move!

472
00:44:31,966 --> 00:44:33,517
No, no, no!

473
00:44:34,795 --> 00:44:37,423
Claire, we're gonna
sink, water's leaking!

474
00:44:40,059 --> 00:44:42,176
We need to get out!

475
00:44:44,309 --> 00:44:46,418
Franklin, watch out!

476
00:44:49,761 --> 00:44:51,761
I wanna go home!

477
00:44:54,449 --> 00:44:56,729
Owen. Owen!

478
00:44:56,753 --> 00:44:58,011
Owen?

479
00:45:00,597 --> 00:45:02,800
Move. Move!

480
00:45:06,988 --> 00:45:08,534
No, no, no...

481
00:45:13,136 --> 00:45:14,628
Owen!

482
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:19,738
Where is he going?

483
00:45:19,762 --> 00:45:21,425
Okay, don't panic. Don't panic.

484
00:45:22,823 --> 00:45:25,448
- We're not gonna make it, Claire.
- We are. We are.

485
00:45:25,479 --> 00:45:27,487
Take a deep breath.

486
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:39,934
- Where's Zia?
- It was a double-cross. They took her.

487
00:46:39,957 --> 00:46:43,167
She must be with Blue. Hey,
can you still track 'em?

488
00:46:45,145 --> 00:46:47,042
Not anymore.

489
00:46:47,957 --> 00:46:49,198
It was a lie.

490
00:46:49,355 --> 00:46:52,933
It was a lie. Bastards!
It was all a lie!

491
00:47:07,025 --> 00:47:09,017
Not all of it.

492
00:47:19,447 --> 00:47:21,282
Move! Move!

493
00:47:21,306 --> 00:47:24,087
Anything of value, I want out of here.
Let's go.

494
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:25,845
What are you doing?

495
00:47:25,869 --> 00:47:29,517
Well just put it up and we'll tow it on.
Let's go!

496
00:47:50,924 --> 00:47:52,564
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

497
00:47:52,573 --> 00:47:56,814
Wait up. Wait up. Stop that truck.
Stop it.

498
00:47:59,483 --> 00:48:03,358
Hey, sweetheart. Hey, girl.
Hey, girl.

499
00:48:12,755 --> 00:48:15,731
You're gonna feel that
when you wake up.

500
00:48:16,302 --> 00:48:18,598
Hey, put your weapon down!

501
00:48:23,268 --> 00:48:25,940
- They have Zia. They're loading out.
- They already have the dinosaurs.

502
00:48:25,971 --> 00:48:27,588
Why do they need us?

503
00:48:27,909 --> 00:48:30,744
They needed the tracking
system to capture Blue.

504
00:48:31,315 --> 00:48:33,940
There she is. She
don't look good.

505
00:48:37,237 --> 00:48:39,182
We need to get on that boat.

506
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:42,582
- The rock's good. We're safe on the rock.
- Just get up, Franklin.

507
00:48:42,813 --> 00:48:45,371
All right, boat's good.
I'm on it.

508
00:48:48,204 --> 00:48:51,024
Get on the boat! Get
on the boat now!

509
00:48:58,775 --> 00:49:00,743
Get to that truck!

510
00:49:17,919 --> 00:49:21,247
- Franklin!
- Hey, get that truck going.

511
00:49:21,808 --> 00:49:23,402
- Are you okay?
- Am I dead?

512
00:49:23,424 --> 00:49:25,113
Not yet, kid.

513
00:49:37,722 --> 00:49:40,871
Come on! Give me your hand.

514
00:49:53,834 --> 00:49:55,396
Hold on!

515
00:51:59,021 --> 00:52:03,036
Mr. Mills? Your
visitor's waiting.

516
00:52:07,337 --> 00:52:09,126
Mr. Eversoll.

517
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:11,953
It's a pleasure to meet you in person
after all this time. How are you?

518
00:52:11,969 --> 00:52:13,789
Excuse me, where
are the dinosaurs?

519
00:52:13,805 --> 00:52:16,242
The dinosaurs... are en route.

520
00:52:16,453 --> 00:52:18,828
Oh, so am I supposed
to sell these ones?

521
00:52:18,836 --> 00:52:21,297
You don't need to worry, okay?
They will be here soon.

522
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:23,609
I don't really work
with amateurs,

523
00:52:23,625 --> 00:52:25,913
so I'm gonna contact my
buyers and call this off.

524
00:52:25,938 --> 00:52:29,001
They will be here tomorrow and your
buyers won't be disappointed. Trust me.

525
00:52:29,026 --> 00:52:32,438
Whatever their interest. Agricultural,
industrial, sport-hunting.

526
00:52:32,471 --> 00:52:35,344
We will have something to suit them.
Eleven species.

527
00:52:35,369 --> 00:52:38,510
Each with unique,
bio-pharmaceutical properties.

528
00:52:38,534 --> 00:52:41,064
I estimate $4 million
per species.

529
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:45,096
$4 million is a slow
Tuesday where I'm from.

530
00:52:45,573 --> 00:52:46,925
You're wasting my time.

531
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:50,268
You ready to make $100
million on a Tuesday? Huh?

532
00:52:51,899 --> 00:52:53,727
All of this is in the past.

533
00:52:54,688 --> 00:52:57,375
Now, I wanna talk to
you about the future.

534
00:52:58,157 --> 00:53:00,508
I'll give you ten minutes.

535
00:53:02,133 --> 00:53:05,250
The whole point of selling
the Isla Nublar dinosaurs

536
00:53:05,275 --> 00:53:07,555
is to finance our
future operations here.

537
00:53:07,602 --> 00:53:09,844
It's, uh... seed money.

538
00:53:09,869 --> 00:53:13,008
Call it an overture to
something much more ambitious.

539
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,430
Yeah. And more
lucrative, I guess.

540
00:53:15,455 --> 00:53:18,337
Right. We've reactivated
the old facilities,

541
00:53:18,353 --> 00:53:22,283
updated the technology and imported the
best geneticists from around the world.

542
00:53:22,314 --> 00:53:24,798
This operation has been
many years in the planning.

543
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:27,876
Genetic power is an
uncharted frontier.

544
00:53:28,111 --> 00:53:31,501
The potential for growth is
more than you can fathom.

545
00:53:33,908 --> 00:53:35,368
This way, please.

546
00:53:35,501 --> 00:53:38,782
If the entire run of our sorry
history has taught us one

547
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:40,220
irrevocable lesson,

548
00:53:40,245 --> 00:53:43,479
it's that man is
inevitably drawn to war.

549
00:53:43,503 --> 00:53:47,573
And is willing to use any
means necessary to win it.

550
00:53:47,674 --> 00:53:48,905
You're gonna weaponize them?

551
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:51,315
We've been using animals
in combat for centuries.

552
00:53:51,331 --> 00:53:53,276
Horses, elephants.

553
00:53:53,284 --> 00:53:56,666
The Soviets used disease-bearing rats
against the Germans in Stalingrad.

554
00:53:56,683 --> 00:53:58,299
- Yes, yes.
- Our geneticists,

555
00:53:58,331 --> 00:54:02,370
have created a direct descendant,
of Henry Wu's masterpiece.

556
00:54:02,612 --> 00:54:05,471
The animal that took
down Jurassic World.

557
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:07,009
Indominus Rex.

558
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,274
Her DNA, retrieved
from the island,

559
00:54:09,298 --> 00:54:12,173
way before its destruction,
forms the architecture

560
00:54:12,197 --> 00:54:14,985
of a completely new creature.

561
00:54:15,111 --> 00:54:18,696
Every bone and muscle designed
for hunting and killing.

562
00:54:18,727 --> 00:54:23,187
And thanks to Owen Grady's research,
it follows human command.

563
00:54:23,578 --> 00:54:27,288
We call it, the Indoraptor.

564
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:37,547
Grandpa? Grandpa?

565
00:54:56,497 --> 00:54:58,950
- Grandpa.
- Maisie.

566
00:54:59,021 --> 00:55:00,278
What are you doing up?

567
00:55:00,302 --> 00:55:02,919
There was a man here today, with Mr.
Mills.

568
00:55:02,951 --> 00:55:06,575
It was probably just some business
about the Century, is all.

569
00:55:06,607 --> 00:55:07,982
I heard them talking.

570
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:11,341
They're going to sell the dinosaurs.
They're bringing them here.

571
00:55:11,888 --> 00:55:13,364
I'm sure you misunderstood.

572
00:55:13,389 --> 00:55:15,326
- I know what I heard, Grandpa.
- Maisie...

573
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:17,857
it's way past your bedtime.

574
00:55:18,061 --> 00:55:19,717
Let's talk about
this in the morning.

575
00:55:19,746 --> 00:55:21,128
- But...
- Maisie.

576
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:24,362
I'll find out tomorrow.
Go to bed.

577
00:55:26,136 --> 00:55:29,159
- Good night.
- Good night, my heart.

578
00:55:58,837 --> 00:56:00,087
Jesus!

579
00:56:07,678 --> 00:56:10,248
Hold on. Just a little longer.

580
00:56:10,311 --> 00:56:12,795
Oh, my God, you guys are alive!

581
00:56:16,779 --> 00:56:18,669
Look what they've done to her.

582
00:56:18,701 --> 00:56:21,053
- Who are these assholes?
- Animal traffickers.

583
00:56:21,078 --> 00:56:23,350
Look how they're treating them. They're
not gonna take them to a sanctuary,

584
00:56:23,375 --> 00:56:24,943
- they're gonna sell them.
- Not Blue.

585
00:56:24,974 --> 00:56:27,271
- They need her for something else.
- Like what?

586
00:56:27,318 --> 00:56:28,936
I don't know, but she's...

587
00:56:28,961 --> 00:56:32,734
She's hemorrhaging and I don't have
instruments to keep her alive.

588
00:56:35,563 --> 00:56:38,437
Claire, come here.
Put your hand here.

589
00:56:38,476 --> 00:56:40,038
Steady pressure.

590
00:56:40,187 --> 00:56:41,569
Hey, hey.

591
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:47,119
I can't take the bullet out without
a transfusion from another animal.

592
00:56:47,144 --> 00:56:49,127
Which one of you guys
know how to find a vein?

593
00:56:49,136 --> 00:56:51,198
I did a blood drive
with Red Cross.

594
00:56:51,222 --> 00:56:53,331
Great! Okay.

595
00:56:53,604 --> 00:56:55,550
Franklin, you take
over for Claire.

596
00:56:55,605 --> 00:56:58,690
- No, no, no, no, no...
- Franklin! Now!

597
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:02,433
Steady pressure.

598
00:57:03,574 --> 00:57:05,479
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

599
00:57:05,519 --> 00:57:07,987
Is it in my mouth? Did
it get in my mouth?

600
00:57:08,284 --> 00:57:10,127
- Sure?
- You're good.

601
00:57:10,456 --> 00:57:12,057
All of the animals
should be sedated.

602
00:57:12,082 --> 00:57:15,058
Look for any type of () their blood
type should be close enough.

603
00:57:15,113 --> 00:57:18,472
Look for carnivores, with two or
three fingers. No more than three.

604
00:57:20,292 --> 00:57:22,331
I think there is one on board.

605
00:57:37,107 --> 00:57:38,880
You've got to be kidding me.

606
00:57:55,582 --> 00:57:57,535
She's tranqed.

607
00:58:02,481 --> 00:58:05,059
Okay, okay. I got it, come on.

608
00:58:05,129 --> 00:58:06,129
Okay.

609
00:58:12,956 --> 00:58:14,893
Are you okay?

610
00:58:15,222 --> 00:58:16,526
I'm okay!

611
00:58:16,706 --> 00:58:17,971
Come on.

612
00:58:23,263 --> 00:58:25,365
- You're gonna have to do it.
- I can't

613
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:28,481
The skin is too thick, I'd have to use
both hands to put pressure on the vein.

614
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:31,067
- You gotta do it.
- I, I can't, I can't reach...

615
00:58:31,093 --> 00:58:33,319
You're gonna have
to climb up there.

616
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:35,319
Oh, I'm not...

617
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:36,718
I'm not gonna climb up there.

618
00:58:36,757 --> 00:58:38,788
You'll be okay. It's
like riding a bull.

619
00:58:38,813 --> 00:58:42,016
Riding a bull? I didn't grow up in
a rodeo or wherever you came from.

620
00:58:42,041 --> 00:58:45,055
She's asleep now. I can't say that she's
gonna be asleep a minute from now.

621
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:47,040
- So, get up.
- Okay, fine.

622
00:58:47,087 --> 00:58:50,172
Oh my God, she stinks. Jesus!

623
00:59:03,249 --> 00:59:04,585
Good job.

624
00:59:04,788 --> 00:59:07,304
You're making this
look totally normal.

625
00:59:09,468 --> 00:59:12,843
You're gonna have to jam it in here.
It's really thick skin.

626
00:59:13,101 --> 00:59:14,186
Ready?

627
00:59:14,694 --> 00:59:16,905
One, two...

628
00:59:19,436 --> 00:59:20,787
Owen!

629
00:59:29,268 --> 00:59:31,595
It's working.

630
00:59:35,385 --> 00:59:36,611
Who left this open?

631
00:59:36,770 --> 00:59:37,770
I got it.

632
00:59:55,874 --> 00:59:57,022
The bars!

633
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,857
I can get through here. Come on.

634
01:00:13,388 --> 01:00:15,106
Jump! Owen!

635
01:00:33,447 --> 01:00:35,071
Did you see that?

636
01:00:37,111 --> 01:00:39,166
Please tell me you
have the blood.

637
01:02:03,272 --> 01:02:05,890
This is Delta. She is one of
the four little therapods.

638
01:02:05,915 --> 01:02:07,866
One of the survivors
from the second group.

639
01:02:07,891 --> 01:02:09,007
Now, watch this.

640
01:02:09,032 --> 01:02:12,109
If I show any sign of
weakness, whatsoever...

641
01:02:17,687 --> 01:02:19,110
You see that?

642
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:23,470
Day 176. Blue is showing
unprecedented levels of compliance.

643
01:02:23,815 --> 01:02:25,924
Here I am with Blue.

644
01:02:26,424 --> 01:02:29,252
She's a therapod
from a new group.

645
01:02:29,377 --> 01:02:32,666
If I show signs of weakness...

646
01:02:45,427 --> 01:02:46,466
Hey...

647
01:02:47,934 --> 01:02:49,356
I'm okay.

648
01:02:50,581 --> 01:02:51,581
She...

649
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:53,685
She's pretty extraordinary.

650
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:05,500
Blue...

651
01:03:05,634 --> 01:03:09,727
displaying levels of
interest, concern,

652
01:03:09,759 --> 01:03:13,282
hyperintelligence,
cognitive bonding...

653
01:03:13,322 --> 01:03:14,805
See that?

654
01:03:16,056 --> 01:03:19,337
Tilting her head, she's
playing for us...

655
01:03:19,516 --> 01:03:22,141
Increased eye movement,
she's curious.

656
01:03:22,166 --> 01:03:24,242
She's showing empathy.

657
01:03:25,166 --> 01:03:28,501
Okay, I'm gonna make an incision
on her leg to remove the bullet.

658
01:03:32,588 --> 01:03:34,916
It's a lot of muscle tissue.

659
01:04:07,804 --> 01:04:09,718
She's gonna be okay.

660
01:04:15,682 --> 01:04:17,666
Blue is the key.

661
01:04:19,315 --> 01:04:20,869
You have Blue...

662
01:04:21,314 --> 01:04:23,283
You'll get these raptors
to do anything.

663
01:04:23,308 --> 01:04:24,542
You're sure she'll live?

664
01:04:24,556 --> 01:04:25,945
If it dies, we have
blood samples.

665
01:04:25,970 --> 01:04:29,649
No, that's not good enough. The
raptor is a behavioural specimen.

666
01:04:29,673 --> 01:04:32,899
- We need her in good health.
- I didn't shoot the damn thing.

667
01:04:32,915 --> 01:04:35,337
What do you want me to do, huh?

668
01:04:35,595 --> 01:04:40,196
You don't have the faintest
comprehension of what I'm doing here.

669
01:04:40,345 --> 01:04:44,510
Do you understand the complexity of
creating an entirely new lifeform?

670
01:04:44,535 --> 01:04:48,144
No, but I understand the
complexity of paying for it. Okay?

671
01:04:48,176 --> 01:04:51,886
All your money will have been wasted if
I don't get Blue here in good health.

672
01:04:51,973 --> 01:04:54,527
To get the next iteration
under control,

673
01:04:54,552 --> 01:04:58,097
it needs to form a familial bond
with a closely related genetic link.

674
01:04:58,105 --> 01:05:01,191
- English, Henry.
- It needs a mother!

675
01:05:02,759 --> 01:05:06,915
Blue's DNA will be part of the
next Indoraptor's make up.

676
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:09,815
So it will be genetically coded
to recognize her authority

677
01:05:09,861 --> 01:05:11,338
and assume her traits.

678
01:05:11,378 --> 01:05:14,807
Empathy. Obedience. Everything the
prototype you have now is missing.

679
01:05:14,839 --> 01:05:18,910
- Okay, so how long is this gonna take?
- It's not a sprint, Mr. Mills.

680
01:05:18,996 --> 01:05:21,753
- It's a marathon.
- Marathon sounds expensive.

681
01:05:21,832 --> 01:05:24,878
Besides, time is running out
and so is my patience, Henry.

682
01:05:24,902 --> 01:05:28,074
You have to understand. This
is all uncharted territory.

683
01:05:28,121 --> 01:05:32,128
A wolf, genetically, is barely
distinguishable from a bulldog.

684
01:05:32,152 --> 01:05:35,011
But within that gray area....

685
01:05:36,245 --> 01:05:37,919
is heart.

686
01:05:38,096 --> 01:05:41,627
Spare me the poetry, Henry. Can you do it?
Can you do it?

687
01:05:41,659 --> 01:05:43,533
Yes, I can do it.

688
01:05:43,612 --> 01:05:45,306
Well then, do it!

689
01:05:45,346 --> 01:05:46,689
Thank you.

690
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:49,353
God, you brainy asshole.

691
01:06:01,962 --> 01:06:04,727
Hey, hey! Maisie!

692
01:06:07,095 --> 01:06:09,883
What is that? What is it?

693
01:06:17,191 --> 01:06:19,948
Keep her in there, and
keep the door locked.

694
01:06:19,987 --> 01:06:22,822
- You want to keep her locked in?
- That's exactly what I want.

695
01:06:22,839 --> 01:06:25,244
Sir Benjamin needs
to see her now.

696
01:06:28,409 --> 01:06:30,541
I believe it's important.

697
01:07:09,355 --> 01:07:10,667
We're here.

698
01:07:10,738 --> 01:07:11,738
Where?

699
01:07:16,418 --> 01:07:17,840
She got a heartbeat?

700
01:07:17,872 --> 01:07:19,543
Yeah. Do you?

701
01:07:19,575 --> 01:07:20,714
We need blood samples.

702
01:07:20,739 --> 01:07:22,543
I'm not here to help you
reset the food chain,

703
01:07:22,568 --> 01:07:25,692
so take your own damn samples.

704
01:07:28,302 --> 01:07:30,466
What a nasty woman.

705
01:07:39,298 --> 01:07:40,845
Hey!

706
01:07:41,610 --> 01:07:43,516
- What the hell is going on?
- I was...

707
01:07:44,361 --> 01:07:46,555
I needed an extra pair of hands.
He volunteered.

708
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:48,126
- You deck crew?
- Aye-aye.

709
01:07:48,150 --> 01:07:49,821
We're logging out. Follow me.

710
01:07:49,846 --> 01:07:51,783
Does that mean we're leaving the ship?
Right now?

711
01:07:51,799 --> 01:07:54,814
That means what that means.
Now get moving. Come on, follow me!

712
01:07:56,337 --> 01:07:58,383
- Shit!
- Oh, no.

713
01:07:58,532 --> 01:08:00,360
He's not gonna make it.

714
01:08:00,759 --> 01:08:03,391
- We have to help him.
- Stay here. I'll get him.

715
01:08:04,812 --> 01:08:07,102
There's no time. Let's go.

716
01:08:22,627 --> 01:08:23,627
Roll out!

717
01:08:25,056 --> 01:08:26,970
Where are they taking them?

718
01:08:27,010 --> 01:08:28,744
We're about to find out.

719
01:08:48,792 --> 01:08:49,878
Yes!

720
01:08:56,024 --> 01:08:57,591
Lockwood's Estate?

721
01:08:59,663 --> 01:09:02,209
He must have one big-ass garage.

722
01:09:47,897 --> 01:09:50,897
Did you really think you
could get away with it?

723
01:09:52,030 --> 01:09:53,591
In my own house.

724
01:09:53,632 --> 01:09:55,342
You entrusted me.

725
01:09:56,014 --> 01:09:59,060
To guide your fortune
into the future.

726
01:09:59,615 --> 01:10:02,005
- I have done that.
- Damn you!

727
01:10:05,462 --> 01:10:07,032
Pick up that phone.

728
01:10:07,204 --> 01:10:10,461
I want you to call the police.

729
01:10:11,001 --> 01:10:14,454
It'll be easier if the
story comes from you.

730
01:10:15,962 --> 01:10:18,266
As you say, sir.

731
01:10:24,770 --> 01:10:26,598
You know, I've been thinking...

732
01:10:26,614 --> 01:10:28,918
John Hammond was right.

733
01:10:29,450 --> 01:10:32,785
It was an unholy
thing that you did.

734
01:10:36,208 --> 01:10:39,613
I'm not the only guilty
one here, am I, sir?

735
01:10:58,254 --> 01:10:59,309
Hey.

736
01:11:01,433 --> 01:11:04,722
We hit that town and we call
the cavalry to shut this down.

737
01:11:09,628 --> 01:11:13,105
Hello. You should've
stayed on the island.

738
01:11:13,340 --> 01:11:15,167
Better odds.

739
01:11:25,914 --> 01:11:27,451
Hi, Claire.

740
01:11:28,842 --> 01:11:31,662
I just wanted to
come and apologize.

741
01:11:31,694 --> 01:11:33,631
I didn't want to bring
you into any of this,

742
01:11:33,656 --> 01:11:36,648
but it was the only way
that we can get the raptor.

743
01:11:36,664 --> 01:11:38,312
And we needed it.

744
01:11:38,375 --> 01:11:39,710
Come on.

745
01:11:41,117 --> 01:11:42,593
So, what?

746
01:11:42,618 --> 01:11:44,164
This is it?

747
01:11:44,226 --> 01:11:46,711
I mean, you're a smart
guy who started a

748
01:11:46,736 --> 01:11:49,523
foundation to cure cancer.
But instead, you...

749
01:11:50,131 --> 01:11:51,131
What?

750
01:11:52,361 --> 01:11:54,841
- Sell endangered species?
- I saved these animals.

751
01:11:54,873 --> 01:11:57,091
You betrayed a dying
man for money.

752
01:11:57,123 --> 01:12:01,060
Claire, I admire your idealism, but
we both exploited these animals.

753
01:12:01,076 --> 01:12:03,021
At least, I have the
integrity to admit it.

754
01:12:03,045 --> 01:12:05,289
I never, ever did
anything remotely illegal.

755
01:12:05,314 --> 01:12:08,006
You authorized the creation
of the Indominus Rex.

756
01:12:08,614 --> 01:12:12,590
You exploited a living
thing, in a cage, for money.

757
01:12:12,677 --> 01:12:15,505
How is that different?
Huh? And you.

758
01:12:15,607 --> 01:12:18,012
The man who proved raptors
can follow orders.

759
01:12:18,051 --> 01:12:21,152
You never thought about the
applications of your research, Owen?

760
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:24,152
How many millions a trained
predator might be worth?

761
01:12:26,914 --> 01:12:28,063
You two...

762
01:12:28,782 --> 01:12:31,328
You're the parents
of the new world.

763
01:12:33,860 --> 01:12:35,696
Hey! Let him go.

764
01:12:35,735 --> 01:12:37,532
- Owen?
- I think I'll break it.

765
01:12:37,555 --> 01:12:39,141
Let him go.

766
01:12:43,245 --> 01:12:44,245
Claire, it's....

767
01:12:52,936 --> 01:12:54,556
Say the word, we
got them, Mills.

768
01:12:54,593 --> 01:12:59,624
Well, as far as everybody else is
concerned, they burned up on the island.

769
01:13:17,217 --> 01:13:19,061
Looks like a full house.

770
01:13:19,601 --> 01:13:20,967
Roger that.

771
01:13:47,672 --> 01:13:49,562
- Good evening.
- Good evening, good evening.

772
01:13:49,587 --> 01:13:51,875
Welcome. Welcome.

773
01:13:53,274 --> 01:13:56,939
This guy, he's Ricky Rathrow.
Darius Pharmaceuticals.

774
01:13:56,970 --> 01:13:57,907
Right.

775
01:13:57,932 --> 01:14:01,196
And the guy in the beard? He's
a proxy for Gregor Aldorich.

776
01:14:01,229 --> 01:14:03,385
Slovenian arms dealer.

777
01:14:37,830 --> 01:14:41,173
Well, he only wants carnivores.
Two of them.

778
01:14:41,205 --> 01:14:44,267
Looks like Lockwood's gonna
have a very good night.

779
01:14:44,306 --> 01:14:46,103
Will he be joining us?

780
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:48,642
That's very unlikely.

781
01:15:00,761 --> 01:15:02,245
Grandpa?

782
01:15:09,578 --> 01:15:10,695
Grandpa?

783
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:13,694
Grandpa, wake up.

784
01:15:15,241 --> 01:15:16,538
Grandpa.

785
01:15:17,897 --> 01:15:20,764
Grandpa, wake up. Wake up!

786
01:15:21,522 --> 01:15:22,857
Iris!

787
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:37,411
Iris!

788
01:15:40,331 --> 01:15:41,573
It's over.

789
01:15:45,143 --> 01:15:47,135
What a tragedy.

790
01:15:50,690 --> 01:15:53,119
I suppose now he's gone,

791
01:15:53,159 --> 01:15:56,190
- you'll be looking for another situation.
- No.

792
01:15:57,448 --> 01:15:59,612
Maisie needs me.

793
01:16:00,878 --> 01:16:03,658
I am her guardian now.

794
01:16:04,401 --> 01:16:07,346
What she needs is no
longer your concern.

795
01:16:08,073 --> 01:16:10,932
You don't understand
her the way I do.

796
01:16:11,776 --> 01:16:14,315
I understand her value.

797
01:16:15,301 --> 01:16:17,051
But I raised her.

798
01:16:17,574 --> 01:16:19,027
I raised...

799
01:16:19,059 --> 01:16:20,480
both of them.

800
01:16:24,428 --> 01:16:27,200
- Please, Mr. Mills.
- Goodbye, Iris.

801
01:17:06,995 --> 01:17:11,221
Do you remember the first
time you saw a dinosaur?

802
01:17:13,174 --> 01:17:17,541
First time you see them,
it's like, a miracle.

803
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:20,572
You read about them in books.
You see the bones in museums.

804
01:17:20,597 --> 01:17:23,181
But you don't really believe it.

805
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:25,189
Kind of like myths.

806
01:17:26,010 --> 01:17:27,791
And then you see...

807
01:17:28,711 --> 01:17:31,351
the first one alive.

808
01:17:35,697 --> 01:17:37,626
This is not your fault.

809
01:17:38,392 --> 01:17:40,728
- But it is.
- No.

810
01:17:42,534 --> 01:17:44,737
This one's on me.

811
01:17:46,534 --> 01:17:48,744
I showed them the way.

812
01:17:50,175 --> 01:17:51,932
Now, listen.

813
01:17:51,956 --> 01:17:55,565
You and I are gonna have plenty
of time to talk about this later.

814
01:17:55,581 --> 01:17:58,307
- If there is a later.
- Yes, there is.

815
01:18:00,526 --> 01:18:02,877
I got a cabin to finish.

816
01:18:11,038 --> 01:18:12,717
What is that?

817
01:18:16,335 --> 01:18:19,772
Well, look who just woke up.

818
01:18:29,995 --> 01:18:31,956
We're getting out of here.

819
01:18:33,097 --> 01:18:37,338
Welcome, ladies, gentlemen...

820
01:18:37,378 --> 01:18:40,909
To this extraordinary evening.

821
01:18:40,948 --> 01:18:45,463
Let's dive right in,
with lot number 1.

822
01:18:45,886 --> 01:18:48,299
The ankylosaurus.

823
01:18:49,667 --> 01:18:52,542
This is a herbivorous quadruped.

824
01:18:52,753 --> 01:18:54,706
Late Cretaceous.

825
01:18:54,808 --> 01:18:58,643
This is one of the largest
armored dinosaurs.

826
01:18:58,877 --> 01:19:03,728
Known by paleontologists
as a "living tank".

827
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:12,123
- What are you doing?
- Save it.

828
01:19:12,256 --> 01:19:14,662
- Are you sure about this?
- Nope.

829
01:19:16,907 --> 01:19:19,821
I have $4 million dollars.
Anyone with 5?

830
01:19:19,939 --> 01:19:23,462
$5 million. $5 million.
Do I hear 6?

831
01:19:23,690 --> 01:19:27,494
$6 million. Thank you. Any increase on six?
Seven. $7 million.

832
01:19:27,581 --> 01:19:32,018
$8 million. $9 million on the phones.
Do I hear $10 million?

833
01:19:33,159 --> 01:19:36,119
$10 million. Once, twice...

834
01:19:36,393 --> 01:19:41,674
Sold! To the gentleman from Indonesia.
Congratulations.

835
01:19:46,096 --> 01:19:49,135
Lot number 2, ladies
and gentlemen.

836
01:19:49,893 --> 01:19:52,846
Juvenile Allosaurus.

837
01:19:54,369 --> 01:19:58,494
A fierce and
aggressive predator.

838
01:20:01,745 --> 01:20:02,893
Sold!

839
01:20:03,385 --> 01:20:04,674
Sold!

840
01:20:05,548 --> 01:20:06,899
Sold!

841
01:20:09,295 --> 01:20:12,663
Wonderful. Wonderful.

842
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:42,679
Okay...

843
01:20:43,133 --> 01:20:46,273
Hey, hey you! Look
at me, look at me!

844
01:20:47,101 --> 01:20:48,304
Hey!

845
01:20:50,156 --> 01:20:51,296
Okay.

846
01:21:09,844 --> 01:21:11,664
You're welcome.

847
01:21:19,884 --> 01:21:23,548
Hey! Wait. Please, please, wait.

848
01:21:28,068 --> 01:21:30,559
That's Lockwood's granddaughter.

849
01:21:31,466 --> 01:21:33,388
Hey. Hey, kid.

850
01:21:33,435 --> 01:21:35,849
You wanna come
down out of there?

851
01:21:39,981 --> 01:21:41,988
Do you remember me?

852
01:21:45,372 --> 01:21:48,059
My name is Claire. What's yours?

853
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:49,856
Maisie.

854
01:21:50,307 --> 01:21:52,908
- Maisie Lockwood.
- Maisie.

855
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:55,846
This is my friend, Owen.

856
01:21:56,870 --> 01:22:00,823
I saw you, with the velociraptors.
And Blue.

857
01:22:00,862 --> 01:22:02,291
Oh, yeah?

858
01:22:06,178 --> 01:22:07,904
You like dinosaurs?

859
01:22:09,443 --> 01:22:12,388
So do I. Tell you what, you
come on down from there,

860
01:22:12,427 --> 01:22:14,856
I'll tell you everything you
need to know about Blue.

861
01:22:15,380 --> 01:22:17,067
That sound all right?

862
01:22:17,982 --> 01:22:20,817
Alright. Yeah. Come on down.

863
01:22:29,740 --> 01:22:31,083
Sweetie...

864
01:22:31,357 --> 01:22:33,326
We need some help finding
your grandfather.

865
01:22:33,349 --> 01:22:35,794
Can you take us to him?

866
01:22:35,818 --> 01:22:36,911
No.

867
01:22:37,232 --> 01:22:39,700
You made it down here
all by yourself, huh.

868
01:22:39,724 --> 01:22:43,294
Brave kid. Looks like
you could use a friend.

869
01:22:43,997 --> 01:22:45,918
He's gone!

870
01:22:49,957 --> 01:22:51,917
So listen, I'll tell you what.

871
01:22:51,934 --> 01:22:55,988
We're just about to go and find our
friends and then get the heck outta here.

872
01:22:56,050 --> 01:22:57,925
You wanna come with us?

873
01:22:57,948 --> 01:23:00,128
We could use a friend, too.

874
01:23:15,124 --> 01:23:16,124
Sold!

875
01:23:16,194 --> 01:23:19,162
And now, ladies and
gentlemen, that we are

876
01:23:19,202 --> 01:23:22,131
halfway through the evening...

877
01:23:23,083 --> 01:23:26,528
We'd like to offer a
special treat to our

878
01:23:26,724 --> 01:23:29,692
discriminating buyers.

879
01:23:29,966 --> 01:23:32,567
This evening, we will preview,

880
01:23:32,716 --> 01:23:36,168
a new asset that we've
been developing.

881
01:23:36,762 --> 01:23:38,814
A creature of the future,

882
01:23:38,839 --> 01:23:41,400
made from pieces of the past.

883
01:23:43,181 --> 01:23:45,954
Ladies and gentlemen,
please be warned.

884
01:23:46,111 --> 01:23:50,204
This is the perfect blend of the
two most dangerous creatures...

885
01:23:50,229 --> 01:23:52,849
that have ever walked the earth.

886
01:23:53,237 --> 01:23:54,987
We call it...

887
01:23:55,229 --> 01:23:57,940
The Indoraptor.

888
01:24:19,173 --> 01:24:22,009
The perfect weapon
for the modern age.

889
01:24:22,301 --> 01:24:24,160
Built for combat.

890
01:24:24,207 --> 01:24:28,261
With tactical responses more
acute than any human soldier.

891
01:24:28,286 --> 01:24:29,684
What is that thing?

892
01:24:46,524 --> 01:24:48,539
They made it.

893
01:24:48,602 --> 01:24:50,508
Mr. Mills, and the other man.

894
01:24:50,572 --> 01:24:52,212
What man?

895
01:24:53,095 --> 01:24:53,853
Him.

896
01:24:53,869 --> 01:24:56,587
Designed by Mr. Henry Wu...

897
01:24:56,612 --> 01:25:00,345
Its' intelligence quotient
comparable to the velociraptor.

898
01:25:00,385 --> 01:25:03,916
Bio-specs include
hyper sense of smell,

899
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:08,187
trained to respond to a pulse
coded, laser-targeting system.

900
01:25:08,212 --> 01:25:13,456
Enabling it to isolate and track
prey in complex environments.

901
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:14,925
Voila!

902
01:25:21,269 --> 01:25:24,714
Now first, your laser
sets the target.

903
01:25:26,979 --> 01:25:32,288
Once locked on, the acoustic
signal triggers the attack.

904
01:25:38,390 --> 01:25:41,241
This animal is relentless.

905
01:25:41,304 --> 01:25:44,741
Now, modifications are
still being made.

906
01:25:44,789 --> 01:25:47,015
$20 million!

907
01:25:49,390 --> 01:25:53,382
Well, this is a prototype.
Not for sale.

908
01:25:53,407 --> 01:25:54,569
21!

909
01:25:54,617 --> 01:25:58,601
Well, it is still a
prototype, but...

910
01:25:59,969 --> 01:26:01,710
23!

911
01:26:02,976 --> 01:26:04,640
24!

912
01:26:06,625 --> 01:26:08,468
$24 million.

913
01:26:08,531 --> 01:26:10,929
$25 million!

914
01:26:11,335 --> 01:26:12,937
Do I hear 26?

915
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:15,405
That thing can't
leave this building.

916
01:26:15,444 --> 01:26:16,389
26!

917
01:26:16,514 --> 01:26:19,529
Any advance on 26? $27 million!

918
01:26:19,553 --> 01:26:21,553
What are you doing? This
animal is not for sale.

919
01:26:21,578 --> 01:26:23,834
Let them have it. We have
to give them a taste.

920
01:26:23,873 --> 01:26:25,455
He's a prototype.

921
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:30,225
This prototype is worth
$28 million right now.

922
01:26:30,568 --> 01:26:33,333
Relax. We'll make some more.

923
01:26:33,404 --> 01:26:35,646
So will they.

924
01:26:56,521 --> 01:26:57,950
Hey, buddy.

925
01:26:58,382 --> 01:27:00,637
You thinking what I'm thinking?

926
01:27:02,310 --> 01:27:05,442
Once, twice, sold!

927
01:27:05,466 --> 01:27:07,614
To the Russian from...

928
01:27:08,973 --> 01:27:14,113
Congratulations for purchasing
this magnificent animal...

929
01:28:22,225 --> 01:28:24,482
Get this thing out of here!

930
01:29:16,178 --> 01:29:17,787
Mills!

931
01:29:18,046 --> 01:29:20,015
Mills, where are you?

932
01:29:20,624 --> 01:29:22,593
I want my bonus.

933
01:29:29,001 --> 01:29:32,524
Holy cow. What are you?

934
01:29:33,149 --> 01:29:35,742
I didn't see you on the island.

935
01:29:53,491 --> 01:29:55,764
You are a tough guy.

936
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:30,950
Look at that beauty.

937
01:30:31,809 --> 01:30:36,574
You're some kind of hot-rod.
With pretty teeth.

938
01:30:37,902 --> 01:30:41,198
This will make a perfect
centerpiece for my necklace.

939
01:30:59,885 --> 01:31:01,510
Open up...

940
01:31:55,530 --> 01:31:57,562
Move ! Move!

941
01:32:42,485 --> 01:32:43,922
Don't!

942
01:32:47,344 --> 01:32:49,985
You two, deserve each other.

943
01:32:50,094 --> 01:32:51,695
Maisie, come with me.

944
01:32:51,719 --> 01:32:54,287
You got your money. Walk away.

945
01:32:54,404 --> 01:32:55,576
What are you gonna do, huh?

946
01:32:55,592 --> 01:32:57,349
We're gonna stop this.

947
01:32:57,670 --> 01:32:59,412
- All of it!
- How?

948
01:32:59,662 --> 01:33:02,318
What, you're gonna go back in time
before Hammond decides to play god?

949
01:33:02,342 --> 01:33:04,178
You can't put it
back in the box!

950
01:33:04,256 --> 01:33:05,678
- We have to try.
- It's too late.

951
01:33:05,709 --> 01:33:07,584
Maisie, come.

952
01:33:11,191 --> 01:33:14,496
So, you're gonna take
care of her now? Huh?

953
01:33:15,161 --> 01:33:17,331
You have no idea what she is.

954
01:33:18,386 --> 01:33:21,675
What do you think drove Hammond
and Lockwood apart, huh?

955
01:33:21,808 --> 01:33:25,393
Lockwood never had a grandchild.

956
01:33:25,949 --> 01:33:28,472
He just wanted his
daughter back.

957
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:33,113
And he had the technology.

958
01:33:33,429 --> 01:33:35,765
He created another.

959
01:33:37,094 --> 01:33:38,633
He made her again.

960
01:33:42,275 --> 01:33:43,486
Go!

961
01:33:49,039 --> 01:33:50,805
Come on!

962
01:34:06,032 --> 01:34:09,196
Get this to Mills. Be very careful.
It's extremely valuable.

963
01:34:09,205 --> 01:34:11,790
You, I need blood samples
from the raptor.

964
01:34:12,594 --> 01:34:14,140
Don't just stand
there like an idiot!

965
01:34:14,165 --> 01:34:18,868
Get me 50 cc carfentanil and a
lobotomy kit. It's right there. Now!

966
01:34:19,649 --> 01:34:21,383
Come on. Come on.

967
01:34:22,289 --> 01:34:25,133
I need this raptor's blood.

968
01:34:25,437 --> 01:34:27,546
Sure. Go ahead.

969
01:34:27,585 --> 01:34:29,788
Where is that kit?

970
01:34:29,843 --> 01:34:31,647
Okay, now listen to me.

971
01:34:31,695 --> 01:34:34,553
It's better if we cooperated.
But I'm gonna get this blood,

972
01:34:34,585 --> 01:34:37,344
- With or without your help.
- This blood's contaminated.

973
01:34:37,384 --> 01:34:39,938
I designed this animal myself.

974
01:34:40,134 --> 01:34:43,483
It's pure. Every cell of
her body was created in a

975
01:34:43,508 --> 01:34:47,227
most controlled environment under
the most demanding conditions.

976
01:34:47,722 --> 01:34:50,745
Yeah, but I did an intravenous
blood transfusion with a T-Rex,

977
01:34:50,753 --> 01:34:52,518
so, it's a sock drawer in there.

978
01:34:52,542 --> 01:34:53,979
You what?

979
01:34:55,170 --> 01:34:57,592
Hold, stop! What are you doing?

980
01:34:58,382 --> 01:35:00,585
Saving your life.

981
01:35:04,391 --> 01:35:05,584
Yes!

982
01:35:05,631 --> 01:35:06,928
Stop!

983
01:35:08,858 --> 01:35:10,592
Don't move.

984
01:35:15,426 --> 01:35:17,348
Now, step away from that cage.

985
01:35:17,389 --> 01:35:18,483
Now.

986
01:35:54,601 --> 01:35:56,812
Run. Run!

987
01:38:00,552 --> 01:38:02,052
Run!

988
01:39:26,509 --> 01:39:28,056
You see that?

989
01:39:28,108 --> 01:39:32,748
That's hydrogen cyanide. If it reaches the
containment level, it will kill them all.

990
01:39:33,897 --> 01:39:35,733
The ventilation system is down.

991
01:39:35,865 --> 01:39:37,920
Can you bring it back up?

992
01:40:10,534 --> 01:40:13,346
The server's unresponsive. I
have to reboot the whole system.

993
01:40:13,417 --> 01:40:15,713
- So reboot it.
- I'm trying.

994
01:40:35,660 --> 01:40:38,238
- Franklin, we don't have time.
- I know, I know, I know.

995
01:40:38,316 --> 01:40:39,441
Okay.

996
01:41:19,699 --> 01:41:21,410
Go! Go!

997
01:42:19,119 --> 01:42:22,658
You're okay. Put pressure on it.
Don't look at it. Look at me.

998
01:42:22,689 --> 01:42:25,376
- You have to go find her.
- I can't leave you here.

999
01:42:29,874 --> 01:42:31,811
Go, I'll be fine.

1000
01:42:31,866 --> 01:42:33,100
Run!

1001
01:45:01,986 --> 01:45:04,095
Maisie, stay down!

1002
01:46:08,370 --> 01:46:11,987
Follow me. I know a
way on the outside.

1003
01:46:14,621 --> 01:46:15,949
Come on.

1004
01:46:18,387 --> 01:46:19,980
Come on!

1005
01:46:36,288 --> 01:46:37,733
This way!

1006
01:47:10,786 --> 01:47:12,475
I got you.

1007
01:47:25,122 --> 01:47:26,199
Hey!

1008
01:49:21,428 --> 01:49:23,240
What the hell?

1009
01:49:25,326 --> 01:49:26,388
Hey!

1010
01:49:28,637 --> 01:49:31,456
Hey! You good?

1011
01:49:33,331 --> 01:49:36,166
- Yeah. You?
- Nope!

1012
01:49:36,464 --> 01:49:39,963
Hey, we have a problem downstairs.
I need you to come see this.

1013
01:50:09,918 --> 01:50:11,488
They're all dying.

1014
01:50:11,513 --> 01:50:13,964
The blast damaged the
ventilation system.

1015
01:50:13,990 --> 01:50:16,505
We did everything we could.

1016
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:20,864
I can open the gates from here.

1017
01:50:21,887 --> 01:50:24,574
Claire, be careful.

1018
01:50:24,933 --> 01:50:27,347
We're not on an island anymore.

1019
01:51:22,798 --> 01:51:24,016
Claire....

1020
01:51:24,103 --> 01:51:27,454
You press that button,
there is no going back.

1021
01:51:32,176 --> 01:51:34,668
We can't let them die.

1022
01:52:24,150 --> 01:52:25,815
I had to.

1023
01:52:26,667 --> 01:52:28,620
They're alive.

1024
01:52:28,658 --> 01:52:30,370
Like me.

1025
01:54:43,324 --> 01:54:44,807
Hey, girl.

1026
01:54:44,831 --> 01:54:46,206
Owen.

1027
01:54:48,355 --> 01:54:51,495
It's okay. She won't hurt us.

1028
01:55:21,954 --> 01:55:24,564
Blue, come with me.

1029
01:55:29,416 --> 01:55:32,501
We'll take you to a
safe place, okay?

1030
01:56:11,188 --> 01:56:13,953
How many times do you
have to see the evidence?

1031
01:56:14,500 --> 01:56:17,414
How many times must
a point be made?

1032
01:56:18,164 --> 01:56:21,226
We're causing our
own extinction.

1033
01:56:21,477 --> 01:56:24,210
Too many red lines
have been crossed.

1034
01:56:24,758 --> 01:56:28,562
And our home has, in fundamental
ways, been polluted by

1035
01:56:28,633 --> 01:56:31,148
avarice, and

1036
01:56:31,250 --> 01:56:33,890
political megalomania.

1037
01:56:34,485 --> 01:56:39,860
Genetic power has now been unleashed. And
of course, that's gonna be catastrophic.

1038
01:56:39,977 --> 01:56:42,387
This change was inevitable,
from the moment we

1039
01:56:42,412 --> 01:56:44,923
brought the first dinosaur
back from extinction.

1040
01:56:45,423 --> 01:56:48,156
We convince ourselves that
sudden change, is something that

1041
01:56:48,173 --> 01:56:52,172
happens outside the normal order
of things, like a car crash.

1042
01:56:52,599 --> 01:56:55,239
Or that it's beyond our
control, like a fatal illness.

1043
01:56:55,294 --> 01:56:59,591
We don't conceive of sudden,
radical, irrational change as

1044
01:56:59,622 --> 01:57:02,606
woven into the very
fabric of existence.

1045
01:57:02,927 --> 01:57:06,005
Yet, I can assure you,
it most assuredly is.

1046
01:57:06,302 --> 01:57:08,552
And it's happening now.

1047
01:57:11,168 --> 01:57:15,683
Humans and dinosaurs are now
gonna be forced to co-exist.

1048
01:57:18,675 --> 01:57:21,682
These creatures were
here before us.

1049
01:57:22,244 --> 01:57:25,596
And if we're not careful,
they're gonna be here after.

1050
01:57:31,009 --> 01:57:34,876
We're gonna have to adjust to new
