1			
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:56,913			 
THE GREAT DEBATES			
			
2			
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:12,161			
Every Father Almighty,			
			
3			
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:17,375			
... I stand before the Ti with all the humility of the world.			
			
4			
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,478			
Father who controls all things.			
			
5
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:25,547
The life and death of all creatures

6
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:30,348
It gives us strength and wisdom to
Make your work

7
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:35,656
And allow to do it
For the good of all.

8
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:38,555
Amen

9
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:04,016
When all this ends,
Be a little better.

10
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:07,757
-- I say that this was not the final.
-- Because it seems that took their revenge

11
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:11,895
-- It was better than Henry.
-- You know what I have here?

12
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:13,230
What?

13
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:14,966
Something to you

14
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:19,229
As a boy, he spoke as a boy.

15
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:24,341
Entendia as boy

16
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,777
I thought as a boy

17
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:30,943
But when I became a man,

18
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:34,183
... I get back all
Things for boys.

19
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:59,208
Class of Year 1,

20
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:03,408
... I believe that we are the most
Lucky in America.

21
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:08,615
Because we have the
Work more importantly,

22
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:11,856
... Of America.

23
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:16,918
The education of our children.

24
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:47,648
What there?

25
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:49,759
Devils Who is he?

26
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,463
It is only my husband.

27
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:57,001
I will cut your head.

28
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,906
We must teach our children.

29
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:06,511
What faced many difficulties.

30
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,308
It is not so bad, is it?

31
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,410
Believes that as
Twice as much as me?

32
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:15,416
They should defeat them

33
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:21,452
Devam doing what
Should be done

34
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,753
... To be able to do what they want

35
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:34,363
Education is the only way out.

36
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:39,336
Let's lift bay, lift.

37
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,070
The output of ignorance.

38
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,539
Like to cut us?

39
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,279
Like to cut, hein?

40
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:49,347
Get your hands for me!

41
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:52,056
The output of obscurity

42
00:04:57,864 --> 00:05:03,302
It will be a glorious light.

43
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,683
Let us return, return.

44
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,147
- To our dear Hamilton.
-- This is not legal.

45
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:58,150
Me returns

46
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:20,904
They are

47
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,809
That's me,

48
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,619
... The darker imão

49
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,025
Me send eat in the kitchen
When the company comes

50
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:38,026
But I river, but how well and creço strong.

51
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:42,158
Tomorrow I sentarei the table
When the company reached

52
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:46,264
Nothing is dare to tell me
That coma in the kitchen

53
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,736
In addition to that, you will see that I am beautiful.

54
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,139
And if envergonharam

55
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:58,781
I too am America

56
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:02,477
Who wrote that?

57
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,584
Martin Hughes, 1924.

58
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,416
1925.

59
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:11,629
You hate to be a game

60
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:15,126
What is done with hands full

61
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,803
The memory will put in their hands

62
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,331
... On your chest

63
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:26,203
And you entederás my hate.

64
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:28,510
Gwendolin Bennet wrote that.

65
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:31,316
She was born in 1902

66
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:33,846
Outside the records

67
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,210
Summer in most states

68
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,523
The blacks are denied
The certificate of birth

69
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,954
From what I can deny my
Age for the rest of my life.

70
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,357
Believe that I am funny?

71
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:49,731
Born without registration.

72
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,335
Mr. Reed, distribute it.

73
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:57,171
I shall to you the news
This emestre

74
00:07:57,543 --> 00:08:00,273
There is a revolution in the north.

75
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,312
In Harlow, are changing the way,

76
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,016
... To think of blacks in America

77
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:07,275
I am speaking of people
As Hughes, Bennett,

78
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:10,287
... Zora Neale Hurston, Collin County.

79
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:15,691
Me food with a spoon,
Silver with the stars and sky.

80
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:18,120
Corto my teeth as
A black guaxinim

81
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,691
The implements of war

82
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,407
Me find after class.

83
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,115
What makes a teacher
In the middle of the night,

84
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:45,117
... Dressed as a peasant?

85
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:48,955
What does a student in the middle of the
Night looking to lose their lives?

86
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,820
What strange, I thought
I was defending me.

87
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:54,828
I remember

88
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:58,565
Some years ago
When disappeared.

89
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:00,305
What was?

90
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:03,071
And I will come when I will.

91
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,066
Te suspended?
-- Asked license.

92
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:08,478
Why again?

93
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:10,883
At school is the only place
Where you can read all day.

94
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,511
Except the prison.

95
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:18,282
I want my will
Home tonight at 7:30.

96
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:19,719
It is at the corner of Junhos and Campos

97
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:20,688
Why would it?

98
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,417
We are recruiting for
A team of debate.

99
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,330
Are you sure you want someone like me?

100
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:29,624
No, why will the evidence.

101
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:33,695
At 7:30, and Junhos Campos.

102
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:02,632
Levado by the wind and rain.

103
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:07,130
He and the Junior today.

104
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:14,535
Of the 360 students here
At the University of Wiley.

105
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,237
Only 45 of these were
Brave to come,

106
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:18,081
... The evidence of the team of debate.

107
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:22,252
Of the 45 only 4 left here
When the tests end.

108
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:25,584
Why? Because the debate
Is a esprte of war.

109
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:29,055
It is a fight, but his weapons are words.

110
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:32,256
Enter ... Now that you
Farmer came can begin.

111
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:36,260
Do you feel Mr. Farmer ...
Not there, there.

112
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:41,066
-- Good evening sra. Tolson.
-- Good evening.

113
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:45,403
-- We hope you sir.
-- Will I have.

114
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:48,271
Thank you, smells good sr. Farmer.

115
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,774
-- Thank you.
-- From nothing.

116
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,681
Ladies and senhorita.

117
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:56,279
This is the place,

118
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:00,081
... Hot.

119
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:03,228
Entered running because wanted.

120
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,628
Mr Tolson, and the debates
Last year?

121
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,264
Do not ask what they already know.

122
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:09,727
Get up, will be the first,
Here in the hot zone.

123
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:13,269
The debate begins with a
Proposal, with an idea.

124
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:17,239
The boys must work in
If regular government.

125
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:20,241
The first debate
Speaks positively.

126
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:21,936
So will agree.

127
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,673
Mr Reed, speak
Positive, the second the negative.

128
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,884
-- What is bad?
-- What are against.

129
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:29,348
Brilliant sr. Burgess.

130
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,850
Falará positively
Sr. Reed, start.

131
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:36,558
Well, start with a
Quote the poet Claycoin.

132
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:41,262
The flowers born so close to the mill.

133
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:46,971
What almost all boys
That work can see.

134
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:53,108
-- Y, Y..
-- What was in that minute?

135
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,478
It was learned that
Last year sr Reed?

136
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:59,507
Start something and not finish, it was so?

137
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:02,010
-- No sir.
-- They are.

138
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,820
Who will be the next?
You, lift, lift.

139
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:15,466
If it is late, as
More if you hide?

140
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,827
I am not hiding me sir.

141
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,266
Me transferring from my university
To come to the evidence.

142
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:20,732
I am very excited, as if called?

143
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,938
-- Samantha Booke.
-- Booke?

144
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:26,968
-- A "and" at the end.
-- From Miss Booke footing with "and".

145
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:32,142
Among the hot zone
Miss Bookde with an "e".

146
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:36,647
You know that there has never been a woman
The team of debate, never?

147
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,746
Yes, I know you.

148
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,653
What makes you think
You could be the first?

149
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,357
-- Because I am as smart as ...
-- Not speak it.

150
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,588
-... Any other person.
-- The theme senhorita.

151
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,960
Social assistance
Desestimula the hard work.

152
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,770
-- Do you speak negatively.
-- Well

153
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:56,567
Assistance strip of man
A stronger reason to work.

154
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:58,606
What is survival.

155
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:04,015
And it weakens the will of
Poor, as refutaria that?

156
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,517
I would say not.

157
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:10,446
Most of this goes to the
Children and the disabled.

158
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:12,815
-... And people bigger.
-- That is a conjecture or a fact?

159
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:14,117
-- It is a fact.
-- Highest.

160
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,521
-- It is a fact.
-- What is your source?

161
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,729
-- The Chairman.
-- Of the United States?

162
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,226
Yes, sir.

163
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:21,626
That is their main source?

164
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,233
.... Spoke with the president
Roosevelt in person?

165
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:25,828
Of course not speak with him personally.

166
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:27,834
But the ever hear.

167
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,435
-- In a radio transmission?
-- Yes

168
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:33,440
Some other source? Some other?

169
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,276
Yes, there are other sources,

170
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,685
... Look like the eyes of a mother
That can not feed their children.

171
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,488
Without the assistance sr. Tolson,
Morreriam people from hunger.

172
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,952
-- Who would die of hunger?
-- The unemployed.

173
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,459
The sr. Burgess is unemployed
And as you can see not died of starvation.

174
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:55,165
I have a shot of you senhorita Booke.

175
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:59,195
Me deêm real facts to
I syllogism not fall.

176
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:01,598
-- Silogismo?
-- His logic that speaks.

177
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:03,707
Principal premise,
Desemprecados die of hunger.

178
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,638
Minor premise,
The sr. Burgess is unemployed.

179
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,946
Conclusion, sr. Burgess
Is dying of hunger.

180
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:11,105
Its main premise was
Based on a mistaken belief.

181
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:12,811
Falácia classic.

182
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,147
Who is next?

183
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:22,819
Esteve well.

184
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,356
-- Say you.
-- Henryu Lowe with a "u".

185
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:32,828
Okay, sir. Lowe, I shall the matter,
You speak it.

186
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,164
Is there any citation of the literature.

187
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,864
Ahead.

188
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,644
Beauty.

189
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:43,946
I heard the Lord say
That all beauty is passing,

190
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:45,443
... As the water.

191
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:48,144
Very good, history.

192
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:50,754
And the author's name this time.

193
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,251
The story is a pesadêlo
I want to wake up.

194
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:55,349
James Joyce.

195
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:00,159
Pena itself.

196
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:06,537
Never saw things wild
Feel sorry for themselves

197
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:09,105
D. H. Lawrence.

198
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:14,108
Me encanta D. H.
Lawrence, already read?

199
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,804
-- Mr. Farmer.
-- Yes, sir.

200
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,950
I have eyes on the neck and
Heard on all sides.

201
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,411
Get up.

202
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:26,623
Tell me the irony in the name.
Bethlehem Steel Corporation

203
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:33,228
Bethlehem is where
Jesus was born, after the peace.

204
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:36,426
And Bethlehem however does
Pra war weapons.

205
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:38,760
Well, sit down.

206
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,632
Who next?

207
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:48,136
Samantha.

208
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:55,149
The sr. Tolson is very tough, no?

209
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,148
I am sure it is.

210
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:00,625
My name is James.

211
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:03,723
Your father is Dr. James Farmer?

212
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,723
Yes, it does.

213
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:09,597
I hear the most and that
Man as speaking languages.

214
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,996
French, Greek, Hebrew,
Latin, who speak languages?

215
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:16,531
-- Some languages.
-- Only a few.

216
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,835
Must be the man most
Intelligent Texas.

217
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:22,809
Not so, it is exaggeration.

218
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:24,948
So you want to be on the team?

219
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:28,245
It would be a good entertainment.

220
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:31,345
-- What?
-- Be lawyer.

221
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:34,718
Lawyer? It is genial.

222
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,725
You know how many women are
Lawyers in the United States?

223
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,653
-- Two.
-- Exactly.

224
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:41,023
One is beautiful.

225
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:45,135
Look sr. Farmer, which his age?

226
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:47,429
I am 16.

227
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,068
In 21 months.

228
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:54,642
Miss, James, only
I wanted to thank.

229
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:58,041
-- Why?
-- By their actions today.

230
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,379
How many other students
Tolson faced?

231
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,779
-- I did not.
-- No, you answered a question.

232
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:04,182
And I just said a few citations.

233
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,321
But the senhorita Brooke with an "e".

234
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,890
-- She fought.
-- And lost.

235
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:14,833
But it has to lose by
It is not their legitimate source?

236
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,196
Because Tolson said.

237
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:21,895
Nobody has better access to
Statistics that the President.

238
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:25,833
If I had said that
The Tolson, would have gained.

239
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:30,240
I do not know with certainty
Something would have happened.

240
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,141
Good evening James.

241
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,420
You can believe that has 14
Years and is the university?

242
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:41,925
They are privileged, everyone.

243
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:44,922
Once you should know that chose
This team for the balance.

244
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,859
... And nobody should
Taken as a failure.

245
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,425
As denigrição of his intellect.

246
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,168
Denigrição, you get another word.

247
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:56,030
From Latin niger, deny,
Black is always present.

248
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:59,833
There is in the dictionary, there is no
Speech of a black teacher.

249
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:04,773
Somehow the black
Always been associated with the failure.

250
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:09,386
Write your own dictionary and
Marquem as a new beginning.

251
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,086
If form part of the team or not.

252
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:17,893
The society of the University
Wiley, of 1935-36, is well.

253
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,794
The member of the team of debate will be.

254
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:24,696
The sr. Hamilton Burgess,
The team last year.

255
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,603
Do you feel sr. Burgess.

256
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:29,938
The sr. Henry Lowe.

257
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:36,337
Our alternating, senhorita
Samantha Booke with an "e".

258
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,915
And finally.

259
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,148
Junior, slower.

260
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,950
-- And Daddy?
-- Silence is writing.

261
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:52,760
-- Daddy.
-- Junior.

262
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:56,057
What is the greatest difficulty
Of a great man?

263
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:00,500
Do not believe the doubt.

264
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:06,668
It is therefore obliged Junior, 1914-31.

265
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,973
This will be a lesson.

266
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:12,112
-- Daddy.
-- Te I somewhat of faith.

267
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,976
What doubt?

268
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:18,078
-- Daddy.
-- What was child?

269
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,023
Entered in the team of debate.

270
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:24,523
Congratulations, and who is on your team?

271
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:28,494
We are 4, I am one of the alternating.

272
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:30,524
Who are you?

273
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:32,497
Hamilton Burgess and Henry Lowe.

274
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,600
And another is alternating Samantha Booke

275
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:38,232
-- Are you a girl?
-- Want to be lawyer.

276
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,943
-- Lawyer?
-- She is very intelligent.

277
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,212
It is beautiful?

278
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:49,917
I do not know, the ever seen.

279
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:53,819
Because the activities
Extracurricular are very important.

280
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,117
But no need for neglecting your purpose.

281
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:57,925
Yes, sir.

282
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,225
Then we do here?

283
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:05,529
We do what we need to
Do what you want.

284
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:08,672
-- What we have to do now?
-- My task

285
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,338
-- Go do it.
-- Yes, sir.

286
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:24,747
Papi bought many
Bananas, apples, cookies,

287
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:28,256
... Eggs, lines, pigs and gonzolabis.

288
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,891
-- Gonzolabis.
-- What is it?

289
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:34,459
Perdiz, partridge.

290
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:37,960
We will, we will.

291
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:42,103
-- Abricó.
-- We will, we will.

292
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,669
Caution.

293
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,677
What was that?

294
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:51,880
Not sure.

295
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:03,925
Stay here.

296
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,131
-- What is it?
-- A pig.

297
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:19,939
Only a pig.

00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:26,683
-- What hell was that?
-- Sorry.

301
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,378
Out of a sudden, there you saw coming.

302
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:33,751
-- Matou him.
-- Sorry, you paid.

303

As both?

I have a few US dollars now but I can ...

But I have a check.

307
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:58,081

00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:00,943
They are 17 US dollars and 36 cents.

309

And I endorsement.

It is better that this cheque is good.

Well, take it.

Wait, where will believe?

You must help us
Put it in the truck.

We will hold the neck of the boy

326

In three.

327
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,185
Malditos blacks of the city,
Do not want to be dirty.

328
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,138
-- Daddy.
-- Te said pra enter the car.

When you get to say
Something has to do.

-- Who is the judge?
-- The judge is God.

331
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,114
Why is God?

332
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:25,018
Because decide who
Won and the opposition.

333
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:27,763
-- And who are your opponents?
-- No.

334
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:29,328

The judge is God.

Why not worth knowing.

Who is the judge?

344
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:53,751
The judge is God.

345
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:54,948
Why?

346
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:58,959

Why not worth knowing.

Who is the judge?

-- The judge is God.
-- Highest.

352
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,232
The judge is God.

353
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:12,601

Why not worth knowing.

358
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:24,245
Let us with the truth

359
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,547
Let us with the truth

360
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:27,318
Yes I would like you to speak.

361
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,019
That is a virtue or a vice?

362
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:33,764
I have to admit that whenever
Wanted to be mysterious and silent.

363
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,228
However, I can not keep silent.

364
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,833
Entraria a fight
Street sr. Burgess?

365
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:41,530
No sir.

366
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,230
So please do not
A fight of words.

367
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,365
There has to deceive yourself.

368
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:48,873
Use your mood against your opponent.

369
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:52,174
-- Mr. Farmer.
-- Yes sir.

370
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:57,653
Mr. Happy Farmer, tell us
Something that we do not know about her father.

371
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:02,283
-- He was the first black with a PhD.
-- Something that we do not know, sir. Farmer.

372
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:10,093
Caminhou of Florida to Massachusetts,
Go to the University of Boston.

373
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:13,127
If formed Magnum Kum Laude.

374
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:15,399
Mr. Lowe.

375
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:20,904
Tell us of your father.

376
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:23,342
Why not something on account of his father?

377
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,906
We know sr. Lowe.

378
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:27,512
And I tried, you know.

379
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:29,509
I am not in the team of debate.

380
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:31,118
We are not discussing now.

381
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:34,622
Well

382
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:37,858
I take the initiative.

383
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:44,331
Take the black evil and more restless.

384
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:48,667
Take the clothes ...
In front of other blacks,

385
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,532
... Women, men and children.

386
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:53,972
Pass Pitch and plumes,
Amarrem in each leg,

387
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:55,837
.... A horse going
In the opposite direction.

388
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:58,138
Prendam fire onto the horses,

389
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:00,075
... Until they leave the half.

390
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:03,780
Faced men,
Black women and children.

391
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:08,225
Give chicotadas coups and the
Black men who fall.

392
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:09,893
Almost to death but not kill.

393
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:12,219
But release the fury
Of God on them.

394
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:14,988
Because they can be
Useful for creating later.

395
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,099
Does anyone know who was
I said that?

396
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,997
Raise your hand, anyone?

397
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:21,235
It was a perverse owner of
Slaves in West, Virginia.

398
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:24,805
The foremen of
Colonies have problems,

399
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,807
... Controlling the slaves.

400
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:29,344
Once you bruscaram
Linch to indicate their methods.

401
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:33,712
The word linchar came from his nickname.

402
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:36,919
His methods were very
Simple but diabolical.

403
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,416
Matinham the slaves
Physically strong.

404
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,453
But weak psicológicamente
And dependent on the owner.

405
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:46,956
They remove the body and the mind.

406
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:50,931
I

407
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:53,261
... And all other
Teachers in this university.

408
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,329
We are here to help you.

409
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:02,577
... To find, retrieve and maintain,

410
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:04,571
... Your mind.

411
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:09,080
Because obviously lost.

412
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,787
That is all you need
Learn from me Sr. Lowe.

413
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:19,995
They can go.

414
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:10,172
-- Want to dance?
-- I.

415
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,235
Come on.

416
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:31,261
It is a good dancer.

417
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:35,057
Thank you, in my practice room.

418
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:38,268
Keep practicing.

419
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:43,573
-- Your ponche.
-- Thank you.

420
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,173
Best I go, I will look a little ponche

421
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,812
-- Yes, I also have my own, will.

422
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:00,314
You know that you can take
A place with real music.

423
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:04,626
-- I will not Henry.
-- We will bring you back.

424
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,621
Who would be my company?

425
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,525
You come back before
That the other is give account.

426
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:18,741
You are afraid?

427
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:32,451
Who is the man, is with fear?

428
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,190
Mr. Tolson.

429
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,237
And it is why the lieutenant
Want the organized.

430
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,036
To do things well.

431
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,806
Yes, but trairemos you.

432
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:12,209
Also the organise.

433
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:14,382
Yes, we denounce for everyone.

434
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,444
That is what they
Want you to believe.

435
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:17,813
The heads of farms
Want to believe that.

436
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,216
... Going to war, but will not.

437
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:21,823
Are idiots but are
Intelligent men of business

438
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,755
And because we are
Organized, summer.

439
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,461
Until the weapons can not stop us.

440
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,664
-- In stopped.
-- Why speaks it.

441
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:30,865
About how we organize
According to the color.

442
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:35,227
-- That was in 1919, friend.
-- Yes, but will fall, friend

443
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:37,368
We feel that.

444
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:41,138
But these men were
Alone, it is I am saying.

445
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:42,911
We are in 1935.

446
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,648
We the National Board of Employment.

447
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:49,081
-- We AFBL.
-- We have nothing, no shit.

448
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:02,789
They are coming, are coming.

449
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:05,525
Apaguem the lights, hide themselves all.

450
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,052
Come on.

451
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:44,733
What are doing here?

452
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:49,033
I was walking on his
Home and saw you dressed well.

453
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,138
Vetido I like them, believe that
I would escutariam if a house?

454
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:56,238
Me listening, I listen?

455
00:36:57,181 --> 00:37:00,048
You can not tell anyone what he saw.

456
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,612
Neither my wife knows nothing of the sort.

457
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:03,079
Do not say anything to anyone.

458
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:06,422
Promise by Sacred
Bible that not right anything.

459
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:54,034
Junior, will only be stopped there?

460
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,366
No sir.

461
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:08,777
I have come late.

462
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:13,215
Sit, are one of the morning.

463
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:16,587
You would have sought where wanted.

464
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,889
Fuia the house of the Lord
Tolson after the dance.

465
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:25,598
I thought I would do this,
Why I was there.

466
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:31,803
I talked to him a woman, said
Tolson had left and that you were not there.

467
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:38,310
Once you give another
Opportunity, which was?

468
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:42,144
-- I can not tell you.
-- Why God.

469
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,817
We were worried about you.

470
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:48,156
Junior was where?

471
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:53,119
-- I can not tell you sir.
-- Why not?

472
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:56,126
-- I do not know.
-- Do not know?

473
00:38:58,035 --> 00:39:00,026
This is not an acceptable response.

474
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:04,372
-- Junior.
-- The silence is not an option.

475
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:09,712
-- Were you drinking?
-- Wanted.

476
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,470
Why should be drinking
To come to my house,

477
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:14,981
... For not wanting to say where
Were until 1 am.

478
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:18,084
-- Let's dear, what's wrong?
-- No problem.

479
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:20,280
Something happened,
Something is amiss.

480
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:23,323
It was with that
Girl, was with her?

481
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:24,688
No.

482
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:27,887
Why has 14 years, has
For a long time after that.

483
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:29,493
There was with Samantha.

484
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:33,997
So where was?

485
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:40,305
Where was dear?

486
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:44,208
Not whether we say, ok.

487
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:46,713
But no will of this house.

488
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:48,915
-- What to say?
-- What will not.

489
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:51,253
There will until they tell me the truth.

490
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:54,822
-- And school?
-- Do not question what I say.

491
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:56,854
-- Mamãe in school?
-- Do not raise your voice.

492
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:58,117
I am not raising the voice.

493
00:39:58,429 --> 00:39:59,919
It will raise the voice in my house?

494
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,721
I am not raising the voice.

495
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:03,727
In case has work pra make money?

496
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:06,732
-- I am not talking about high.
-- Only ask excuses.

497
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:09,062
I did not say anything to that
Have to excuse me.

498
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,465
As apologized to
The man of pork?

499
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:13,341
Who said?

500
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:22,145
Go get your room.

501
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:39,661
It will not be weak with him.

502
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,398
I know.

503
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:46,809
I can not allow
My son is a corrupt.

504
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:52,406
You are right, we only get bed.

505
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:56,710
I levarei the school the morning.

506
00:40:57,321 --> 00:40:58,982
-- Okay?
-- Okay.

507
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:15,271
I will be honest with you, I am not well.

508
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,931
I am not anything well this morning.

509
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,632
Sorry sir.

510
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,044
But it seems you well, right?

511
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:23,846
Yes sir, seems very well.

512
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:27,945
We will have some kind of white
North who come to our town.

513
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,950
They are bringing problems between
Men of color and whites.

514
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:33,750
They say that we
Make a union.

515
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:36,790
All workers,
Those of color and whites.

516
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:40,889
Needing a trade union?
Who believes that?

517
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:43,756
I do not know you, I do not know much of this.

518
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:48,963
Esas is a bad idea,
Believe it is an extremely bad.

519
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:50,966
Yes, sir.

520
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:54,401
They say that there was a meeting
Secretly near the lake.

521
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:56,906
Do you know anything about that?

522
00:41:57,214 --> 00:41:58,181
No sir.

523
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,241
Do not know?

524
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:03,652
-- Samuel?
-- No sir.

525
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:04,819
-- Do not know?
-- No sir.

526
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,819
-- Jura?
-- Yes, sir, interest.

527
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:12,259
Okay then.

528
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:16,763
The see later.

529
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:19,628
Our first debate is,

530
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:23,338
.... Within a week.

531
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:26,437
-- In a week?
-- That same.

532
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:28,644
I thought the preview was first.

533
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:30,643
Preview is the highest, so I thought
That we need a warming.

534
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,746
With the best black university in the USA?

535
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:36,347
That same sr. Burgess,
Is with fear?

536
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:37,848
Yes sir.

537
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:41,056
A week is not enough time
Write to the arguments.

538
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:43,251
You will
Research, I should write.

539
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:46,994
Wait, you, so you write?

540
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:48,094
And you tell the sr. Lowe.

541
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:49,698
What devils seem, a postman?

542
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,164
The devil will be
I ask again.

543
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:55,270
In theory seems a student.

544
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:57,570
So is saying
I am not capable?

545
00:42:57,775 --> 00:43:00,505
There is no question of ability
But of experience.

546
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:02,702
-- How can you?
-- So I write.

547
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:06,216
Thus has always been,
Will be well.

548
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:08,611
Some other question?

549
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:12,620
One week.

550
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:18,056
Bring them to our first
Student yes.

551
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:21,054
The University of Callqueen.

552
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:23,463
Oquery Hobert.

553
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:34,639
The assistance of
Unemployed should acarba.

554
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,739
When the depression finish.

555
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:39,740
If it is going to end.

556
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:43,449
I have traveled in atrá
History until 1536.

557
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:45,747
When the first laws of
England were written.

558
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:49,057
In these days to assistance
As a call.

559
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,551
They were paid through
Voluntary donations.

560
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,454
But over time,

561
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:56,866
... The British divided
The systems of maintenance.

562
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:59,167
The first law of unemployment.

563
00:43:59,603 --> 00:44:02,003
If paid with donations not voluntary.

564
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:04,704
More commonly known as taxes.

565
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:08,201
This system was a disaster.

566
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:10,844
Not enough to give
A man a job.

567
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:13,910
But to do so would
That give you an economic life.

568
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,650
Not levy taxes until they died.

569
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:24,523
When capitalism was young.

570
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,762
The concept puritano of duty was,

571
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:29,926
... That no one who works not comeria.

572
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:33,467
And this was happening when
More work than men.

573
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:35,234
But those days passed.

574
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:39,064
Now those who want to
Work are unemployed,

575
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:40,742
So they should not eat?

576
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:42,241
Because there is no work?

577
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:44,437
Today, we need
Another concept of duty.

578
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,150
The right of an individual
Of losing the sociedae,

579
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,285
... Both as a society.

580
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:55,589
Applaud to anything
That seems a solution.

581
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,854
60 million dollars
The month for assistance.

582
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:02,625
Pagaria with it if it
Eliminated the vagabonds of the streets.

583
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,997
One seventh of the population of this
Live country's welfare.

584
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,900
Would be good with it
End the misery.

585
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:12,798
A nation so desperate with this,

586
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:14,500
... Is a danger to itself.

587
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:23,118
As a general Roman brought
Peace provinces rebels.

588
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:26,719
Killing for all its citizens.

589
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:29,048
Until his companions
Romans were in shock.

590
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:32,727
One described ...

591
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:36,322
What that create siginifica
Desolation and call it peace.

592
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:42,331
And with all the facts and data,
Of Callqueen also created desolation.

593
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:44,038
And call for peace.

594
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:47,742
They want that desempregadosmorram
So that the economy could live.

595
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:08,189
A bright young man
Us once asked,

596
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:10,525
... Argued that its position
On social assistance.

597
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:14,528
She named the most powerful source

598
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:18,600
The look in the eyes of a mother
When they can not feed their children.

599
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:25,142
They can look at the famine
In the eyes of a child?

600
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:28,509
See the blood on your feet by walking
Descalço in the fields of cotton?

601
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:31,649
Perguntarem her sister
With pain in the belly of hunger,

602
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:33,617
... It is with ethics
The work of his father?

603
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:46,629
He is good.

604
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:08,184
All that matters is that
The big fish and small,

605
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:10,883
... The color of the fish does not see.

606
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:13,821
GANHADOS 2. LOST 0.

607
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:18,491
We should do something every
Time a victim is black.

608
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:20,693
The federal government
Should not intervene?

609
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:27,741
GANHADOS 3. LOST 0.

610
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:59,736
And the winner is ...

611
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,777
The University of Wiley.

612
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:13,080

Okay, it is what you want.

They will, goodbye.

618
00:48:57,034 --> 00:48:59,332
-- Shit.

619
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:01,701
Captain Wayne Right.

620
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:03,402
The captain of police of Texas?

621
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:10,312
He wants to wait
And not get the leader,

622
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:12,376
... Until he and his boys arrive.

623
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:14,908
Shit, for sure whether
Leave in the newspaper.

624
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:18,584
So we do the whole
Work and they have the glory.

625
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:24,087
Once the world works.

626
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,495
I am sure Samuel?

627

Mandamos some letters
Some universities.

630
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:48,111
Counting of us,
Of our team,

631
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:49,512
... Do we do.

632
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:53,216
Us and they responded.

633
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:57,016
The University of
City of Oklahoma.

634
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:59,318
-- Not?
-- Yes, Anglo-Saxons.

635
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:02,625
We will be the first university
U.S. black,

636
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,323
... And one of the first
University in America,

637
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:06,124
... To have a debate in
A university white.

638
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:07,530
That's nice.

639
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:09,329
The University of Oklahoma.

640
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:12,030
Not the University of Oklahoma
But to the city of Oklahoma.

641
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:14,774
The debate will be in a
Camp in the north.

642
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:17,240
Because a camp?

643
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:20,939
Why should the times
Take things little by little.

644
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:24,379
You are not saying that
Can enter the university?

645
00:50:24,588 --> 00:50:26,783
No, I say we should
Go slowly.

646
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:29,457
-- This is a great opportunity.
-- Thank you.

647
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,491
The opportunity to merge
Migalha one of your plate.

648
00:50:37,901 --> 00:50:39,061
What?

649
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:41,568
I believe that Lowe is afraid.

650
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:44,169
James Who?

651
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:46,503
I believe that is afraid of
Discuss with whites

652
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:47,870
-- Anglo-Saxons.
-- Anglo-Saxons.

653
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:50,170
-- Thank you.
-- Me leave discuss.

654
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,075
I debaterei with
Anglo-Saxons wherever.

655
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:56,309
In a dark alley without light.

656
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:59,020
With a Candelabrum and people
In pursuing with weapons.

657
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:01,247
I debateria with
Anglo-Saxons wherever.

658
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:03,826
-- I am not afraid.
-- I do.

659
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:10,861
Mr. Tolson when I came here today.

660
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:13,229
I saw men of
Sherife watching your house.

661
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:16,029
What is hovendo?

662
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:22,244
Maybe you should
Ask sherife.

663
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:24,338
There are many rumours about what it does.

664
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:27,877
My father called the
Dean last week.

665
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:30,076
And asked if there was a
Communist at the University Methodist.

666
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:34,451
My policy is my problem and promise
That does not put at risk the team.

667
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:36,056
But if you are in danger.

668
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:39,458
I came to learn University
Not that I investigate.

669
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:41,493
-- Te understand.
-- I do not want drag.

670
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:43,193
Yes my father ...

671
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:46,596
Souber.

672
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:51,700
Mr. Tolson me just say
It is not communism is not ...

673
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:53,269
If not what?

674
00:51:57,681 --> 00:51:59,080
If not what?

675
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:00,815
My father said that I should leave him.

676
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:02,712
-- Nobody wants that.
-- Me says.

677
00:52:05,822 --> 00:52:09,724
As I said, my policy is my problem.

678
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,328
Then I leave it.

679
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:28,033
Mrs. Tolson, thanks for dinner.

680
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:31,443
De nada.

681
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:35,283
Good luck in Oklahoma.

682
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,478
I know that win.

683
00:52:56,907 --> 00:52:58,670
If someone wants more
Let me, I entenderei.

684
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:47,850
The black ...

685
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,651
... Should be admitted.

686
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:55,094
We can hear you.

687
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,199
I say,

688
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:03,901
Black people should be admitted,

689
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:06,198
... At the state university.

690
00:54:07,844 --> 00:54:10,108
My companion and I taste it,

691
00:54:10,814 --> 00:54:13,408
... Blocking the admission of blacks,

692
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:16,745
... At the University of the State
Is not only wrong.

693
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,317
It is absurd.

694
00:54:20,323 --> 00:54:25,522
People of color are not
Only the color on the cloth American.

695
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:29,130
They are the line that
Keeps everything together.

696
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:32,731
Considering the records
Legal and historical.

697
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:36,535
May 13, 1865,
Craker sergeant, a black.

698
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:39,538
It is the last soldier who
Died in the Civil War.

699
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:42,368
In 1918 the first
American soldiers,

700
00:54:42,646 --> 00:54:44,273
Condecorados by ...
Prowess in France.

701
00:54:44,648 --> 00:54:48,243
Are blacks Henry
Johnson and Nito Robins.

702
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:53,079
1920, The New York Times
Announces that the "n" of black,

703
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:55,890
... Is to write capital
From there on.

704
00:54:56,192 --> 00:54:59,355
Leaving the south for them, but where
Are not prepared for this.

705
00:55:00,397 --> 00:55:02,524
It would cause nothing but racial hatred.

706
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:08,837
The doctor WE Devoid, perhaps
The most eminent black America.

707
00:55:09,105 --> 00:55:10,402
He said,

708
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:13,300
... It is a loss
Silly of money.

709
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:14,941
Time and temperament,

710
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:17,309
... Deal with what the majority does,

711
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:20,311
... Which determined
That never would.

712
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:23,811
My opponent chose
Conveniently ignore,

713
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:28,814
... That W. E. Devoid is
The first black receberu a PhD,

714
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:31,320
... In a university
White, imagine.

715
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:33,923
The doctor said that it is impossible,

716
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:39,129
... Impossible for a black
Receive a proper education,

717
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:41,234
... In a white university.

718
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:43,233
Most black eminiente
University of America,

719
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,440
... Is the product of a
Education white.

720
00:55:46,142 --> 00:55:49,339
Devoi knows well the resistance
The white man to change.

721
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:52,938
But that is no reason to keep any
The black out of any university.

722
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,341
If someone forçasse the south to something
For which is not prepared.

723
00:55:56,553 --> 00:55:59,044
Then, however, be wrong
And srta. Booke would cook

724
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:06,185
Admit it is true.

725
00:56:07,097 --> 00:56:09,895
Many white are infected
With the disease of racial hatred.

726
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:15,728
And the racism would be impossible
For a negro be happy,

727
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,939
... In a southern university today.

728
00:56:18,641 --> 00:56:20,040
And if someone is unhappy,

729
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:24,346
... It is impossible to see how they can
Receive a proper education.

730
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:29,812
If, come the moment where
Blacks and whites are the same school.

731
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,049
And share the same classes.

732
00:56:34,758 --> 00:56:36,817
But unfortunately that day is not today.

733
00:56:37,427 --> 00:56:40,919
While the schools are segregated.

734
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:44,725
The black one rebeberão
Education which are both,

735
00:56:44,968 --> 00:56:46,833
... Separate and unequal.

736
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:49,235
By thinking of Oklahoma.

737
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:52,940
The state is spending 5 times more,

738
00:56:53,176 --> 00:56:54,837
... In the education of a child white.

739
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:57,170
What in the education of a black.

740
00:56:57,781 --> 00:57:00,045
This means better
Books for that child.

741
00:57:00,283 --> 00:57:02,615
I say that this is a lástima.

742
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:05,979
But my opponent said
That today is not that day,

743
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:09,622
... So that blacks and whites
Go the same university.

744
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:12,187
Share the same premises.

745
00:57:12,395 --> 00:57:14,329
Walking in the same classes.

746
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:17,794
Could you tell me when
Is that that day will come?

747
00:57:18,034 --> 00:57:19,092
On tomorrow?

748
00:57:19,402 --> 00:57:21,597
On this week that
Come, in one hundred years,

749
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:22,997
... Never?

750
00:57:23,306 --> 00:57:27,709
There is no time for justice. The time
For freedom and equality,

751
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:31,344
... Is always, always, always now!

752
00:57:48,832 --> 00:57:50,629
Thank you.

753
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:02,772
What is this?

754
00:58:03,112 --> 00:58:05,080
Te said it is wine,
Care with heart.

755
00:58:06,015 --> 00:58:07,676
-- If said.
-- It's good.

756
00:58:09,686 --> 00:58:11,483
Replace if needed.

757
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:20,722
And my arms were the words.

758
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:23,930
It would not have to do anything, anything, you will see ...

759
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:27,330
Me find out in 5 minutes.

760
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:29,703
Okay.

761
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:45,318
Nobody knows that better than you.

762
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:48,723
-- How is Pearl?
-- Pearl?

763
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:51,016
What vom see you, and your husband?

764
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:52,419
You are in the studio.

765
00:59:06,576 --> 00:59:09,807
-- Dr. Farmer.
-- Congratulations Melvin.

766
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:11,976
-- Thanks.
-- In put on the map.

767
00:59:12,181 --> 00:59:15,014
Your child has done a great job,
His research is impeccable.

768
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:17,878
This is good, good.

769
00:59:19,822 --> 00:59:24,191
There are people of the city that are not
Happy with their other activities.

770
00:59:25,795 --> 00:59:27,126
The call radical.

771
00:59:28,097 --> 00:59:30,122
I surpeenderia
That one day discovered,

772
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,300
... And I said that
You hung in a tree.

773
00:59:33,536 --> 00:59:34,696
Would that get me before.

774
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:37,935
Melvim This is serious, very serious.

775
00:59:38,207 --> 00:59:40,402
A hungry black steals
A chicken and will get prison.

776
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:44,736
A rich merchant, steals the
Farm and goes to the congress.

777
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:45,946
I believe that this is wrong.

778
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:48,515
If that makes me radical, a
Socialist, a communist ...

779
00:59:49,852 --> 00:59:51,342
-- Jesus was radical.
-- Be careful.

780
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:53,316
-- Yes, it was, it was radical.
-- Careful, careful.

781
00:59:53,656 --> 00:59:56,750
Many institutions are in flood
People who badly interpreted Jesus.

782
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:59,119
Now it is compared with Jesus Christ?

783
00:59:59,529 --> 01:00:02,157
If compares with Jesus? You know
What the words are.

784
01:00:02,632 --> 01:00:04,031
-- Come on.
-- Amen

785
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:05,665
I do not want me confused.

786
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:07,334
I am not confusing, I believe.

787
01:00:08,638 --> 01:00:10,765
Do not you think.

788
01:00:12,141 --> 01:00:14,575
Only worries me their methods.

789
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:18,041
What methods?

790
01:00:19,048 --> 01:00:21,448
James was there tonight, huh?

791
01:00:22,752 --> 01:00:24,276
It was not me.

792
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:26,584
-- Is the surrounding it?
-- Of course not.

793
01:00:26,856 --> 01:00:29,051
I will do everything possible
Make it out of this.

794
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:31,657
Deixá it? He wants to be that?
Me says it wants?

795
01:00:31,894 --> 01:00:34,454
No, not whether, perhaps
Should discuss this with him.

796
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:38,163
I am speaking with you and
I do not believe that is honeto.

797
01:00:38,368 --> 01:00:40,063
I am being honest ...

798
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:41,759
I think that was there with him tonight.

799
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:44,166
-- He was not me.
-- He is a boy of 14 years.

800
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:45,296
I understand.

801
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,568
And I will do whatever it takes to
Protect you, understand?

802
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,175
Someone has headquarters?

803
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:53,182
-- Thanks.
-- From nothing.

804
01:00:56,386 --> 01:00:58,684
-- This is a beautiful party.
-- Thank you.

805
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:01,322
I think it is time to cut the cake.

806
01:01:01,524 --> 01:01:02,957
-- Please.
-- Te ajudarei.

807
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,131
It is not time to talk about it.

808
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:15,334
-- Congratulations.
-- Thanks.

809
01:01:40,263 --> 01:01:41,753
This is so beautiful.

810
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:48,069
Yes, I was born here, near the lake.

811
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:51,772
I come here since he was a boy.

812
01:01:53,276 --> 01:01:55,005
His parents live here?

813
01:01:55,812 --> 01:01:58,076
No, they already were.

814
01:01:59,115 --> 01:02:00,343
My grandparents created me.

815
01:02:01,117 --> 01:02:05,713
And my grandfather spent their lives building
All this, of course bounty.

816
01:02:06,422 --> 01:02:07,946
He was a slave?

817
01:02:09,425 --> 01:02:11,325
My grandmother always me
Said that if we do not include well.

818
01:02:11,527 --> 01:02:13,859
The Confederates would
And I would take.

819
01:02:23,473 --> 01:02:24,371
What?

820
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:27,675
Never had seen his side before.

821
01:02:28,444 --> 01:02:29,638
What next?

822
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:33,242
It seems so calm, peace.

823
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:38,248
This happens, I am happy here.

824
01:02:41,657 --> 01:02:42,954
It's funny.

825
01:02:57,273 --> 01:03:00,299
Part of me wants
Stay in the lake.

826
01:03:01,844 --> 01:03:05,541
Reading books all day,
Fishing when you have hunger.

827
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:10,342
And the other part wants to go
To all places and see everything.

828
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:13,414
Want to go to New Orleans,
In New York, Chicago,

829
01:03:13,856 --> 01:03:16,051
... San Francisco.

830
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:22,829
Take the road.

831
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:27,035
And disappear.

832
01:03:30,573 --> 01:03:32,871
Maybe I can take you.

833
01:05:19,815 --> 01:05:21,180
-- Stir Up
-- Which was?

834
01:05:21,217 --> 01:05:22,912
The band is outside.

835
01:05:22,952 --> 01:05:26,353
What? By Allah. He said that
Anyone see today.

836
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:27,912
Usually nobody comes.

837
01:05:27,957 --> 01:05:29,948
Wait, wait.

838
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:35,224
Vista itself

839
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:36,595
What is there?

840
01:05:36,632 --> 01:05:39,533
We will seek Mr. Tolson and
Samantha and return to university.

841
01:05:41,237 --> 01:05:42,499
We will view themselves.

842
01:05:42,538 --> 01:05:45,439
Go and tell Tolson, I
With me later.

843
01:05:46,976 --> 01:05:50,241
Let Lowe, knows that
We will grow ...

844
01:06:01,991 --> 01:06:04,619
It seems that it will join later.

845
01:06:17,206 --> 01:06:19,003
It will join later.

846
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:22,508
Are some things get done.

847
01:06:40,229 --> 01:06:43,721
Good news, good
News, good news ...

848
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:47,263
My phone tapped until
No more power.

849
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:49,497
The University of Michigan wants
Discuss with us.

850
01:06:49,538 --> 01:06:52,974
This goes to you, to Georgia,
Where is sr. Lowe?

851
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:54,771
Once again the debate?

852
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:57,711
Faster than imagined
James, much faster.

853
01:06:57,747 --> 01:06:58,873
When?

854
01:06:58,948 --> 01:06:59,972
When it is ready.

855
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:01,277
I am ready now.

856
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:03,683
Mr. Tolson, I do not believe that James ...

857
01:07:06,589 --> 01:07:08,250
What is there?

858
01:07:08,290 --> 01:07:10,485
Maybe you tired of this.

859
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:11,652
What?

860
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:13,594
From see other people debating.

861
01:07:13,629 --> 01:07:15,893
When I my opportunity Tuesday?

862
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:17,990
It is our best researcher James.

863
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:19,899
There could do nothing without you.

864
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:22,495
I know you can do it without me.

865
01:07:26,909 --> 01:07:28,399
Sorry.

866
01:07:31,313 --> 01:07:32,302
-- James.
-- What?

867
01:07:32,348 --> 01:07:34,509
James, wait.

868
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:38,118
It was very unpleasant what I said.

869
01:07:42,024 --> 01:07:43,548
I do not want to lose your friendship ...

870
01:07:43,626 --> 01:07:46,459
How can you lose
Something that has never?

871
01:07:47,129 --> 01:07:49,222
It has never been my friend?

872
01:07:49,265 --> 01:07:51,665
Perhaps not only want to be your friend.

873
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:54,066
Maybe I machuque be your friend.

874
01:08:09,985 --> 01:08:11,384
-- Legend not translated --

875
01:08:15,491 --> 01:08:17,220
Mr. Tolson.

876
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:23,856
Where is he?

877
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:25,366
-- Calma Lowe.
-- You saw it?

878
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:26,800
We left.

879
01:08:26,836 --> 01:08:28,736
-- They did something to you?
-- No, we are fine.

880
01:08:28,804 --> 01:08:30,271
Journal.

881
01:08:30,306 --> 01:08:31,933
I am Dr. James Farmer.

882
01:08:32,007 --> 01:08:34,100
This is William Taylor,
The lawyer sr. Tolson.

883
01:08:34,143 --> 01:08:36,134
-- And this is his wife, Ruth
-- Hi

884
01:08:36,212 --> 01:08:38,043
I would like to see my client, please.

885
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,604
William.

886
01:08:39,648 --> 01:08:41,673
Journal Dozier, Dr. James Farmer,
This is William ...

887
01:08:41,717 --> 01:08:43,014
William, as it is?

888
01:08:43,052 --> 01:08:46,044
-- Well, sr. And you?
-- Not so bad, not so bad.

889
01:08:46,088 --> 01:08:49,751
Look as time passes, knew
William when I was a boy

890
01:08:49,825 --> 01:08:52,293
Can I see my client
Now, officer?

891
01:08:52,328 --> 01:08:54,057
His client?

892
01:08:54,096 --> 01:08:58,032
The reality of the facts, it
That his client is busy.

893
01:08:58,067 --> 01:08:59,557
Busy, doing what?

894
01:08:59,602 --> 01:09:01,968
Journal, official.

895
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:05,463
We have a problem ...

896
01:09:06,008 --> 01:09:08,670
-- Send the kids get out there.
-- According.

897
01:09:09,879 --> 01:09:13,315
Let it go, let it go ...

898
01:09:27,396 --> 01:09:29,421
-- Are you?
-- OK.

899
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:33,696
Look, this is what happens to a
When people give a lot wing.

900
01:09:34,136 --> 01:09:35,569
They get the problems.

901
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:38,004
The people want to turn away for nothing.

902
01:09:38,073 --> 01:09:41,008
Many may quit
Machucados if this continues.

903
01:09:42,411 --> 01:09:45,073
Journal, it is clear
That is not evidence,

904
01:09:45,114 --> 01:09:46,843
To secure sr Tolson.

905
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:48,850
I suggest that we let it go.

906
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:51,250
You suggest? Who hell are you?

907
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:54,717
Some months,

908
01:09:54,757 --> 01:09:57,419
There was a beating in a bar in the city.

909
01:09:58,327 --> 01:10:02,229
It was a peaceful and dear
Of our citizens,

910
01:10:02,264 --> 01:10:06,530
That was brutally attacked by a
Gangue of violent vigilant.

911
01:10:06,569 --> 01:10:10,130
You have been witness, because there was.

912
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:14,138
If you allow cause
Sherife this anger,

913
01:10:14,176 --> 01:10:17,339
It is you who is
Breaking the law. Not them.

914
01:10:18,614 --> 01:10:20,946
You are threatening me?

915
01:10:20,983 --> 01:10:22,541
No, sir.

916
01:10:22,585 --> 01:10:23,882
I would not make it.

917
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:26,979
But I can not speak for
That people who are outside.

918
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:32,727
When the law is not
Just, not flame law.

919
01:10:32,761 --> 01:10:34,888
What does that mean?

920
01:10:34,964 --> 01:10:36,955
A mass of angry citizens.

921
01:10:36,999 --> 01:10:39,991
Whites and blacks.

922
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:42,333
Brigando as in war.

923
01:10:42,371 --> 01:10:46,068
That's what you want as
Sherife this county?

924
01:10:48,644 --> 01:10:51,078
Leaving that Tolson go get home.

925
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:55,482
I believe that all these friends
That are out there ...

926
01:10:56,785 --> 01:10:58,912
... Will also get home.

927
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,776
-- This application costs 25 US dollars.
-- What?

928
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:30,243
I believe that money should qu eme.

929
01:12:29,745 --> 01:12:31,110
Building up sr. Farmer.

930
01:12:32,881 --> 01:12:34,849
Oh God ...

931
01:12:40,055 --> 01:12:42,615
The Universdidade the Methodist
South canceled.

932
01:12:42,658 --> 01:12:46,526
The University of Georgia
Appear that will do the same.

933
01:12:46,562 --> 01:12:48,189
Why?

934
01:12:49,465 --> 01:12:51,865
Always has been the black.

935
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:54,165
They are speaking on censoring,

936
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:56,637
The council asked me that

937
01:12:56,672 --> 01:12:59,937
Stop working with
Leaders, and in another way,

938
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:02,273
I say that this is not my fight.

939
01:13:02,311 --> 01:13:04,643
So ...

940
01:13:04,713 --> 01:13:06,476
... Things are evil ...

941
01:13:06,515 --> 01:13:08,142
My academic career is at risk,

942
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:10,845
My team for debate is not pra go.

943
01:13:12,921 --> 01:13:15,082
Someone knows who was Anteu?

944
01:13:15,124 --> 01:13:19,424
Certainly, it was a giant
Of Greek mythology.

945
01:13:20,028 --> 01:13:23,828
His mother was Gaia, which was the land.

946
01:13:25,167 --> 01:13:29,160
It was invincible because the contact
With the land was stronger.

947
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:31,638
Correct, was stronger.

948
01:13:31,673 --> 01:13:35,609
It had to defeat the
Which was strong.

949
01:13:35,644 --> 01:13:37,737
You are my students,
I am your teacher.

950
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:40,510
I believe that this bond is sacred.

951
01:13:40,549 --> 01:13:42,449
What will I do now?

953
01:13:43,552 --> 01:13:46,885
Why the board said,
Because the sherife said?

954
01:13:46,955 --> 01:13:49,822
Why do the guards
Texas said? No!

955
01:13:49,858 --> 01:13:52,383
I am being coerced to do.

956
01:13:52,461 --> 01:13:55,157
My message you get
Does not return.

957
01:13:55,197 --> 01:13:56,596
We did not let us quit.

958
01:13:56,665 --> 01:13:57,563
Good

959
01:13:57,599 --> 01:13:59,464
What to do?

960
01:13:59,501 --> 01:14:01,093
-- What discuss with Harvard.
-- Harvard?

961
01:14:01,136 --> 01:14:04,230
The University of Harvard, they
Have the national champions.

962
01:14:04,306 --> 01:14:06,968
If the derrotarmos,
Derrotaremos the best.

963
01:14:07,009 --> 01:14:08,977
Sr.Tolson with respect.

964
01:14:09,011 --> 01:14:11,002
Harvard do not want to compete with us.

965
01:14:11,046 --> 01:14:13,173
We are a small University
From Marshall, Texas.

966
01:14:13,215 --> 01:14:14,375
I know that we Henry.

967
01:14:14,416 --> 01:14:16,247
I have read their letters,
Studied their monitors ...

968
01:14:16,318 --> 01:14:17,751
How do we get there?

969
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:19,287
Only if contunarmos winning.

970
01:14:19,321 --> 01:14:21,915
Dr. Farmer informed me,
That the Harvard University,

971
01:14:23,025 --> 01:14:23,923
Will give a demonstration
Prior next week.

972
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:25,422
We have nothing to lose.

973
01:14:26,328 --> 01:14:27,124
If elimanarmos Harvard ...

974
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:29,727
... We defeated the
University best in the country.

975
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:33,265
Assure them that this will not
Will be able to ignore that.

976
01:14:34,169 --> 01:14:35,636
Correct?

977
01:14:35,737 --> 01:14:37,034
Yes

978
01:14:46,248 --> 01:14:48,773
-- Look good, does not see this?
-- Tried throughout corner.

979
01:14:48,851 --> 01:14:52,548
-- Preview, Texas. It is the 1-27.
-- Me ensiana that meeting.

980
01:14:52,588 --> 01:14:54,556
1-27, look good.

981
01:14:54,590 --> 01:14:57,650
-- Not here.
-- Is yes, that is not found.

982
01:14:57,693 --> 01:14:59,786
He saw the 2 and 7.

983
01:14:59,862 --> 01:15:02,524
Sure, look it, is here.

984
01:15:04,099 --> 01:15:07,398
After 1-26,
Before 1-28.

985
01:15:08,437 --> 01:15:11,600
No way ... where
Gone this map?

986
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:56,149
What are doing?

987
01:15:56,184 --> 01:15:58,084
I will fall.

988
01:15:59,154 --> 01:16:01,179
Tour pro car, close the door.

989
01:16:02,624 --> 01:16:04,592
Nobody moves.

990
01:16:06,295 --> 01:16:09,093
Abaixem is abaixem up.

991
01:16:12,701 --> 01:16:14,430
Download up too.

992
01:16:30,118 --> 01:16:31,608
It has a black in that car.

993
01:16:32,521 --> 01:16:34,614
Come on, let's pick it.

994
01:17:21,403 --> 01:17:25,601
Ok, all seats
Quiet, I will ...

995
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:28,303
... Fetch the keys.

996
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:39,648
-- How is sra. Baker?
-- I am fine.

997
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:40,845
-- Okay?
-- Yes

998
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:43,320
-- Among please.
-- Thanks

999
01:17:49,031 --> 01:17:50,430
Henry.

1000
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:56,435
Henry.

1001
01:17:57,839 --> 01:17:59,431
Henry.

1002
01:19:00,469 --> 01:19:02,494
Hi baby, how are you?

1003
01:19:05,006 --> 01:19:07,372
I was waiting for?

1004
01:19:10,679 --> 01:19:12,977
What is the problem dear? Come on.

1005
01:19:15,717 --> 01:19:17,184
Samantha.

1006
01:19:18,887 --> 01:19:20,377
Shut your mouth and we will.

1007
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:22,185
-- Which was?
-- Come on.

1008
01:19:23,291 --> 01:19:25,885
-- Where are we going?
-- We must talk.

1009
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:32,132
Te thought sr. Tolson.

1010
01:19:49,217 --> 01:19:51,151
Ok, she feels ...

1011
01:19:55,223 --> 01:19:56,850
Come here ...

1012
01:19:56,925 --> 01:19:58,552
... Gives me a hug.

1013
01:19:59,828 --> 01:20:01,318
Stop.

1014
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:12,700
It has no value ...

1015
01:20:12,741 --> 01:20:14,140
How?

1016
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:16,736
Believes that you are the only one affected?

1017
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:24,109
Ok, I feel very ...

1018
01:20:24,152 --> 01:20:26,245
... By all ...

1019
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:30,087
... By drinking ...

1020
01:20:31,459 --> 01:20:33,427
... I am sorry.

1021
01:20:33,461 --> 01:20:37,591
I am not talking about me.

1022
01:20:52,113 --> 01:20:54,274
Ok

1023
01:20:54,316 --> 01:20:55,977
I will deal with it.

1024
01:20:57,285 --> 01:21:00,015
It will not, she does not have to see you so.

1025
01:21:00,722 --> 01:21:02,121
No, all is well,
Talk to her ...

1026
01:21:02,224 --> 01:21:03,851
Let me resolve
My things alone

1027
01:21:10,565 --> 01:21:13,329
Calma boy, stop.

1028
01:21:14,236 --> 01:21:16,067
Stop, I am not fighting you.

1029
01:21:16,137 --> 01:21:17,900
Easy.

1030
01:21:17,939 --> 01:21:19,531
You are crazy?

1031
01:21:23,345 --> 01:21:26,746
Never forget what
Seen, never forgotten.

1032
01:21:27,549 --> 01:21:30,177
These are the ones who can
Cut your fingers,

1033
01:21:30,252 --> 01:21:32,686
Your fingers, your nose, your ears.

1034
01:21:32,754 --> 01:21:34,813
Sometimes the parties have intimate.

1035
01:21:34,856 --> 01:21:37,484
Sometimes you degolam alive.

1036
01:21:40,295 --> 01:21:43,389
We never can forget that.

1037
01:21:58,580 --> 01:21:59,569
Believed that?

1038
01:21:59,614 --> 01:22:02,515
You will not do anything
James, does nothing.

1039
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:05,018
In Texas, lincham the black.

1040
01:22:05,053 --> 01:22:06,714
It?

1041
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:10,451
So no matter what the make?

1042
01:22:10,525 --> 01:22:12,288
What tá speaking ... what?

1043
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:14,386
All this is useless.

1044
01:22:14,429 --> 01:22:16,124
What am I talking about?

1045
01:22:17,032 --> 01:22:21,435
We are only discussing topics blacks
With which we agree.

1046
01:22:21,469 --> 01:22:24,063
James, does not speak well.

1047
01:22:24,139 --> 01:22:26,767
-- Why not ...?
-- Why can not.

1048
01:22:27,742 --> 01:22:29,937
You do not.

1049
01:23:13,922 --> 01:23:16,117
Goodbye, God bless.

1050
01:23:19,961 --> 01:23:21,656
Where is Samantha?

1051
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:23,197
It is not going to us.

1052
01:23:23,231 --> 01:23:24,721
Why not?

1053
01:23:24,766 --> 01:23:26,825
What do you think?

1054
01:23:27,068 --> 01:23:28,365
Take it to the road.

1055
01:23:28,536 --> 01:23:30,333
To come back to school.

1056
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:36,433
I want this opportunity? This is your chance.

1057
01:23:42,450 --> 01:23:44,884
How can any black ...

1058
01:23:44,953 --> 01:23:47,387
... Defend the punishment of imprisonment ...

1059
01:23:47,455 --> 01:23:51,152
... When such exercises
Oppression in their own lives?

1060
01:23:53,962 --> 01:23:54,360
How?

1061
01:23:54,396 --> 01:23:58,958
Because the crime itself
Is a form of oppression.

1062
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:02,629
And the blacks are the victims
Of violent crimes,

1063
01:24:02,704 --> 01:24:06,196
But that ninhuma another race in America.

1064
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:10,511
For us.

1065
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:15,107
... The arrest not only offers
Protection, but retribution.

1066
01:24:15,150 --> 01:24:16,139
Yes, it is so.

1067
01:24:16,217 --> 01:24:17,878
And for the criminals ...

1068
01:24:17,919 --> 01:24:20,717

1088
01:27:02,984 --> 01:27:04,918

Knew it would be very good.

They will have to change their topic of

The two teams will be delivered
The same reference books.

1193
01:37:07,421 --> 01:37:12,051
The new topic arises, the disobedience
Civil morality is a weapon to fight for justice.

1194
01:37:12,092 --> 01:37:15,459
The University of Wiley will
Discussing the affirmative.

1195
01:37:15,496 --> 01:37:16,622
Thank you.

1196
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:21,333
I can not communicate with me sir. Tolson.

1197
01:37:21,702 --> 01:37:23,135
Nobody knows where he is.

1198
01:37:23,204 --> 01:37:24,967
You are in our hands.

1199
01:37:25,005 --> 01:37:26,370
We can not do without it.

1200
01:37:26,407 --> 01:37:31,106
You are mistaken, not
We can win without it.

1201
01:37:34,114 --> 01:37:35,911
Drought?

1202
01:37:43,224 --> 01:37:45,158

-- But is that ...

1206
01:37:55,035 --> 01:37:59,938
Lee, James, let's wait, we
That await the best stop the final.

1207
01:37:59,974 --> 01:38:02,807
Why is that
Head to the hearing ...

1208
01:38:03,477 --> 01:38:06,207
I think we should include this in Graha ...

1209
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:11,183
I disagree, I do not believe that
People understand this, "saragarra" ...

1210
01:38:12,620 --> 01:38:18,286
"Sarcher graha" ... the sânscritos,
Siginifica truth and justice.

1211
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:28,261
Te said.

1212
01:38:28,302 --> 01:38:31,032
It is clear to me that we must
Start the debate with Ghandi.

1213
01:38:31,105 --> 01:38:32,333
That is precisely what I will do.

1214
01:38:32,406 --> 01:38:33,668
Why start with the obvious?

1215
01:38:33,707 --> 01:38:35,106
Because that is what wins the debate.

1216
01:38:35,142 --> 01:38:36,905
Listen to what I said, this is Harvard.

1217
01:38:36,944 --> 01:38:39,640
The first should say that, it
Which means disobedience ...

1218
01:38:40,648 --> 01:38:41,842
Ghandi is a poet strong.

1219
01:38:41,916 --> 01:38:43,440
I want to win. You want to win?

1220
01:38:43,517 --> 01:38:44,449
Do I want to win.

1221
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:48,111
This is the way we win.

1222
01:38:48,923 --> 01:38:51,050
He asked
Responsible. Not to you.

1223
01:38:52,426 --> 01:38:53,358
I am who makes the decision.

1224
01:38:53,427 --> 01:38:54,621
We will not start with Ghandi.

1225
01:38:56,730 --> 01:38:59,961
-- You are a marica.
-- You are an idiot.

1226
01:39:00,968 --> 01:39:02,526
Ah, I am an idiot?

1227
01:39:02,569 --> 01:39:05,595
When the two devil,
To hell with the debate.

1228
01:39:05,673 --> 01:39:09,006
When I devil?
Just because you fix?

1229
01:39:22,690 --> 01:39:25,488
-- She will return right?
-- You will see when you arrive.

1230
01:41:32,086 --> 01:41:34,452
It is beautiful when sleeping.

1231
01:41:48,268 --> 01:41:49,826
Yes, I know, I know ...

1232
01:41:49,870 --> 01:41:52,862
It can not prevent me from you look.

1233
01:41:53,774 --> 01:41:56,174
Shut your mouth a little.

1234
01:41:57,678 --> 01:41:59,873
James, come on, stand up.

1235
01:41:59,913 --> 01:42:01,403
No.

1236
01:42:01,448 --> 01:42:03,109
James ...

1237
01:42:07,421 --> 01:42:09,616
Let James, Levante.

1238
01:42:15,629 --> 01:42:17,221
What?

1239
01:42:22,236 --> 01:42:23,760
What is this?

1240
01:42:25,239 --> 01:42:27,264
These are my notes.

1241
01:42:28,342 --> 01:42:30,537
What is giving me?

1242
01:42:30,577 --> 01:42:33,171
Because you discuss in my place

1243
01:42:33,247 --> 01:42:35,078
What?

1244
01:42:35,149 --> 01:42:36,946
It is your time James.

1245
01:42:36,984 --> 01:42:38,884
You are talking serious?

1246
01:42:39,887 --> 01:42:42,685
-- You are crazy.
-- Has 14 years and is as good as me.

1247
01:42:42,756 --> 01:42:44,018
The judges will love you.

1248
01:42:44,057 --> 01:42:45,615
No, not up.

1249
01:42:45,659 --> 01:42:47,957
I am not giving up Samantha.

1250
01:42:49,963 --> 01:42:53,763
Tolson made me captain, and told me
You were ready.


1251
01:42:54,668 --> 01:42:56,863
You saw me the other
Instead, it was horrible.

1252
01:42:56,904 --> 01:43:00,237
Yes, it was terrible. T
Arrested aquel point. Right?

1253
01:43:00,307 --> 01:43:03,708
So. So I will quit,
So will render?

1254
01:43:06,513 --> 01:43:08,003
No.

1255
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:15,920
Who is the judge?

1256
01:43:16,823 --> 01:43:18,222
What?

1257
01:43:18,258 --> 01:43:20,818
What is the judge?

1258
01:43:22,829 --> 01:43:25,127
The judge is God.

1259
01:43:25,866 --> 01:43:28,426
And why is He?

1260
01:43:29,736 --> 01:43:34,036
Why He decides who wins and
Loser, not my opponent.

1261
01:43:34,942 --> 01:43:37,467
Who is your opponent?

1262
01:43:37,544 --> 01:43:40,206
There is.

1263
01:43:40,247 --> 01:43:42,545
Why not?

1264
01:43:43,150 --> 01:43:48,053
Because it is only a distant voice
Face the truth that I speak.

1265
01:43:50,257 --> 01:43:53,590
Correct. Speak the truth.

1266
01:43:54,861 --> 01:43:59,127
Directly from Harvard, in the Classroom
Magna, in Cambridge Massuchusetts,

1267
01:43:59,166 --> 01:44:05,036
This is the WNBC Radio, bringing
Live the debate that will make history.

1268
01:44:05,105 --> 01:44:08,370
Among the small teams
University of Wiley, Texas,

1269
01:44:08,408 --> 01:44:10,808
And the team of
Harvard University.

1270
01:44:10,844 --> 01:44:15,110
For the first time a small team
Sees the champions of Harvard.

1271
01:44:15,148 --> 01:44:19,107
Who climbs on the stage now,
And the audience is silent.

1272
01:44:21,755 --> 01:44:23,655
On this special occasion,

1273
01:44:23,724 --> 01:44:26,022
We welcome as a separate
Universdidade team of Wiley.

1274
01:44:26,727 --> 01:44:32,723
Presenting the judges, the audience,
And through the radio, the nation.

1275
01:44:33,567 --> 01:44:37,128
The University of Harvard celebrates
300 of his birthday this year.

1276
01:44:37,738 --> 01:44:42,505
Thanking the Franklin Eleanor Roosevelt,
5 th President of the USA.

1277
01:44:42,542 --> 01:44:46,535
But throughout University, no matter
How big is your history,

1278
01:44:46,580 --> 01:44:49,071
Can not allow live in your past,

1279
01:44:49,149 --> 01:44:52,414
Then the spirit of tomorrow,

1280
01:44:52,452 --> 01:44:55,979
The present today,

1281
01:44:57,057 --> 01:44:59,321
Debatedores the University of Wiley.

1282
01:44:59,359 --> 01:45:02,590
Samantha and Booke
Mr. James Farmer Junior.

1283
01:45:14,508 --> 01:45:18,000
Mr. Farmer discuss
The first yes.

1284
01:45:37,264 --> 01:45:39,789
Resolvo:

1285
01:45:39,833 --> 01:45:45,135
The civil disobedience is a weapon
Morality in the fight for justice.

1286
01:45:46,039 --> 01:45:49,270
But how can consider such a thing?

1287
01:45:49,343 --> 01:45:52,335
I think it depends on
Definition of the words.

1288
01:45:53,847 --> 01:45:55,747
Word.

1289
01:45:56,850 --> 01:46:01,253
In 1899 in India, 10
Thousand people gathered,

1290
01:46:01,288 --> 01:46:04,280
To protest
The laws of tyranny.

1291
01:46:04,324 --> 01:46:05,154
We started?

1292
01:46:05,192 --> 01:46:07,319
Your brother is talking, feel.

1293
01:46:07,394 --> 01:46:10,625
The Gal. Reginald Dyer,
The trancou a courtyard,

1294
01:46:10,697 --> 01:46:14,690
The soldiers for their
Confrontassem for 10 minutes.

1295
01:46:16,303 --> 01:46:18,897
379 died.

1296
01:46:19,406 --> 01:46:24,207
Men, women, children,
Murdered in cold blood.

1297
01:46:25,445 --> 01:46:28,903
Dyer said that through
Give them a lesson.

1298
01:46:29,649 --> 01:46:33,050
And people do not
Responded with violence,

1299
01:46:33,720 --> 01:46:37,554
And yes with a campaign
Organised of non-cooperation.

1300
01:46:38,625 --> 01:46:40,820
The buildings of
Government were occupied,

1301
01:46:40,861 --> 01:46:43,796
The streets of people
Which is denied to move.

1302
01:46:43,830 --> 01:46:46,355
Still being beaten by the police.

1303
01:46:46,433 --> 01:46:48,333
Gandhi was arrested.

1304
01:46:48,368 --> 01:46:51,132
But the British were
Obliged to release him.

1305
01:46:52,139 --> 01:46:55,165
The called "a moral victory".

1306
01:46:56,443 --> 01:46:58,707
The definition of morality:

1307
01:46:58,745 --> 01:47:02,476
Assassination of Dyer,
Or the victory of Ghandi?

1308
01:47:03,283 --> 01:47:05,114
You decide.

1309
01:47:22,702 --> 01:47:25,136
- 1914 1918,

1310
01:47:25,906 --> 01:47:29,433
The world was at war with each minute.

1311
01:47:31,111 --> 01:47:34,706
4 men gave their lives.

1312
01:47:35,615 --> 01:47:37,810
Just think them.

1313
01:47:37,851 --> 01:47:41,184
240 young and brave men,

1314
01:47:41,221 --> 01:47:44,952
Were sentenced every hour
Every day,

1315
01:47:45,025 --> 01:47:48,324
Of each night for long 4 years.

1316
01:47:51,431 --> 01:47:54,525
35 thousand hours.

1317
01:47:55,135 --> 01:48:00,664
8,281,000 casualties.

1318
01:48:02,876 --> 01:48:11,978
240

1319
01:48:12,586 --> 01:48:17,489
And here the fact immeasurable
Katerikoli another before the event.

1320
01:48:19,092 --> 01:48:22,323
Is there anything moral about this?


1321
01:48:23,296 --> 01:48:25,059
Nothing.

1322
01:48:25,098 --> 01:48:28,727
Except that Germany wanted
Enslave all of Europe.

1323
01:48:29,636 --> 01:48:33,629
The civil disobedience not
It is moral because it is not violent.

1324
01:48:33,707 --> 01:48:38,974
Fighting with violence to defend
Their country is the most profoundly moral.

1325
01:48:39,012 --> 01:48:43,210
Demandando large
Sacrifices of all.

1326
01:48:44,518 --> 01:48:46,748
The life itself.

1327
01:48:46,820 --> 01:48:50,347
The non-violence, is the mask
Pões so that the civil disobedience

1328
01:48:50,423 --> 01:48:52,653
To conceal its true face.

1329
01:48:54,461 --> 01:48:56,224
The anarchy.

1330
01:49:08,074 --> 01:49:10,907
Gandhi believed that should always act

1331
01:49:10,977 --> 01:49:13,468
With love and respect against his opponents.

1332
01:49:13,513 --> 01:49:17,074
So when are debatedores Harvard.

1333
01:49:18,084 --> 01:49:20,848
Gandhi also believed that
Those quebravam the law,

1334
01:49:20,887 --> 01:49:24,721
Would have to accept the consequences
Legal of their actions.

1335
01:49:25,392 --> 01:49:28,122
That sounds like Anarchy?

1336
01:49:28,194 --> 01:49:32,494
The social disobedience, not
It is something we should fear.

1337
01:49:33,199 --> 01:49:35,895
It is after all
American a concept.

1338
01:49:35,936 --> 01:49:39,929
Gandhi was not their inspiration
In the Indian scriptures,

1339
01:49:40,006 --> 01:49:44,500
But by Henry David Drough that
I was graduated in Harvard,

1340
01:49:44,544 --> 01:49:48,605
Guided by those who do not
Are very far from here.

1341
01:49:55,422 --> 01:49:57,913
My opponent is right in one aspect.

1342
01:49:58,758 --> 01:50:01,454
Drough was a graduate of Harvard,

1343
01:50:01,528 --> 01:50:03,894
And how many of us,

1344
01:50:03,930 --> 01:50:06,558
Bet that expanded their intellect.

1345
01:50:08,535 --> 01:50:11,698
He wanted to say:

1346
01:50:11,738 --> 01:50:13,603
"Any man more
Letrado that its neighbours,

1347
01:50:13,640 --> 01:50:16,973
Constiutui a majority of one. "

1348
01:50:17,477 --> 01:50:20,139
Words that Drought not calculated,

1349
01:50:21,047 --> 01:50:24,983
That Adolf Hitler studied
As them.

1350
01:50:26,486 --> 01:50:30,582
The beauty and value of
Democracy is this:

1351
01:50:30,657 --> 01:50:35,617
"No idea without prevalesce
The support of the majority ".

1352
01:50:35,662 --> 01:50:38,654
The people who decide the
Moral standards of his time,

1353
01:50:38,698 --> 01:50:41,462
Not a majority of one.

1354
01:50:41,501 --> 01:50:45,631
The majority did not decide
What is right or wrong.

1355
01:50:45,672 --> 01:50:48,038
But the conscience yes.

1356
01:50:48,074 --> 01:50:52,477
Because our citizens,
Entregariam their conscience

1357
01:50:52,579 --> 01:50:54,706
By the opinion of a majority.

1358
01:50:54,781 --> 01:50:58,740
We never, never in dobraríamos.

1359
01:50:58,785 --> 01:51:03,347
Forward the belief of any majority.

1360
01:51:10,130 --> 01:51:13,896
We can not choose which laws
Obey, or which ignore.

1361
01:51:13,933 --> 01:51:18,370
If we could never
Pararíamos in the red.

1362
01:51:20,173 --> 01:51:25,042
My father is one of the men
That are between us and chaos.

1363
01:51:26,446 --> 01:51:29,108
It is official police.

1364
01:51:29,149 --> 01:51:31,640
I remember a day that her partner,

1365
01:51:32,452 --> 01:51:34,249
His best friend,

1366
01:51:34,354 --> 01:51:37,687
Was overthrown in the fulfillment of the duty.

1367
01:51:39,159 --> 01:51:44,563
But vivid than the other, I
The expression on the face of my father.

1368
01:51:47,667 --> 01:51:49,635
Nothing ...

1369
01:51:49,669 --> 01:51:53,571
... That impedes the performance of
Law can be moral.

1370
01:51:53,606 --> 01:51:56,973
No matter where it dermos.

1371
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:48,352
Why not say something?

1372
01:53:05,512 --> 01:53:07,742
In Texas ...

1373
01:53:09,516 --> 01:53:12,007
... Lincham the black.

1374
01:53:13,620 --> 01:53:15,747
My companions and I,

1375
01:53:15,822 --> 01:53:18,518
Saw a man hanging by the neck.

1376
01:53:19,826 --> 01:53:22,727
What had also been burned.

1377
01:53:23,763 --> 01:53:26,459
Fugimos the flock of linchadores.

1378
01:53:27,934 --> 01:53:31,734
Pressionamos our faces
Against the floor of the car.

1379
01:53:35,141 --> 01:53:37,769
I looked for my teammates.

1380
01:53:38,378 --> 01:53:40,346
I saw the fear in their eyes.

1381
01:53:42,949 --> 01:53:47,784
And worse, the shame.

1382
01:53:50,590 --> 01:53:53,115
What was the crime that black?

1383
01:53:53,159 --> 01:53:58,392
What should be placed without judgement,
In a forest dark and foggy.

1384
01:53:59,766 --> 01:54:01,700
He was a thief?

1385
01:54:02,602 --> 01:54:04,627
He was a murderer?

1386
01:54:05,638 --> 01:54:08,334
Or just a black?

1387
01:54:09,409 --> 01:54:11,809
It was a worker?

1388
01:54:12,512 --> 01:54:14,207
A preacher?

1389
01:54:14,848 --> 01:54:17,715
His children were waiting for him?

1390
01:54:19,018 --> 01:54:21,953
Who was next?

1391
01:54:22,021 --> 01:54:26,151
And did nothing.

1392
01:54:27,227 --> 01:54:31,721
No matter what was done,
Linchadores were criminals.

1393
01:54:32,832 --> 01:54:35,062
But the law did nothing,

1394
01:54:35,134 --> 01:54:39,332
So we are asking: Why?

1395
01:54:44,677 --> 01:54:46,804
My opponent said:

1396
01:54:46,846 --> 01:54:50,373
"Nothing that break the law
Can be moral. "

1397
01:54:51,150 --> 01:54:54,449
But do not be written law
Say that the black

1398
01:54:54,487 --> 01:54:57,581
Has no right to a home, that
Are rejected in schools,

1399
01:54:57,657 --> 01:55:01,388
In hospitals, nor
We are linchados.

1400
01:55:05,498 --> 01:55:07,796
St. Augustine said:

1401
01:55:07,834 --> 01:55:11,429
"An unjust law is not law."

1402
01:55:12,205 --> 01:55:16,505
What I have
Right, even the duty to resist.

1403
01:55:18,711 --> 01:55:23,705
With violence or civil disobedience ...

1404
01:55:28,021 --> 01:55:31,718
They should pray because
Chose the latter.

1405
01:56:02,088 --> 01:56:03,453
In the debate tonight,

1406
01:56:03,489 --> 01:56:06,014
Between Harvard University,

1407
01:56:06,893 --> 01:56:09,589
And the University of Wiley.

1408
01:56:12,532 --> 01:56:15,399
The winner is ....

1409
01:56:37,023 --> 01:56:40,117
The University of Wiley.

1410
01:58:01,374 --> 01:58:04,309
Only 7 years later in
1942 James Farmer Junior

1411
01:58:05,178 --> 01:58:08,272
Founded the Congress of Racial Equality.

1412
01:58:08,781 --> 01:58:11,909
And became a leader in the
Civil rights movement.

1413
01:58:14,120 --> 01:58:16,884
After a long life
To teach and write.

1414
01:58:17,423 --> 01:58:20,722
James Farmer father, died in 1961.

1415
01:58:21,894 --> 01:58:24,829
The day before
Samantha Booke, lawyer,

1416
01:58:25,431 --> 01:58:27,991
It took the first trip
The freedom to Alabama.

1417
01:58:30,436 --> 01:58:32,802
