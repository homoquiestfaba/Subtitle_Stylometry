There was an article about it

221
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:04,140

Sorry. That's my fault.

235
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,180
Sorry. That's my fault.

236
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:25,090
We were getting our bands

238
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:27,550

You probably noticed

243
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:36,020
It's a major deal

244
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,660
It's a major deal

245
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:38,140
There's a carnival

246
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:41,030
There's a carnival

247
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:41,090

248
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:44,060
You have to be at least

249
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,400
You have to be at least

250
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,060

Wait! Wait, wait, wait.

281
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:40,094
The one thing Doris likes more

282
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,060
The one thing Doris likes more

283
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:45,210
on TV even is yard sales.

284
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,430
on TV even is yard sales.

285
00:07:48,433 --> 00:07:49,060
She even bought her car

286
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,800
She even bought her car

287
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:52,230
She goes to every single one

288
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:55,170
She goes to every single one

289
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:55,210
It's where most of the stuff

290
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:58,100

[man] That's really special.

294
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,200
That belonged to my wife's

295
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,280
That belonged to my wife's

296
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:06,230
or somebody.

00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,060
Came from Europe.

298
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:08,650
Came from Europe.

299
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:09,190
Oh, it's very interesting.

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,020
-(box rattling)

302
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:13,060
It rattles.

303
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,050
$35.

304
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:15,390

$10.

309
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,160
Alright.

310
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,505
Alright.

311
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,060
(chuckles)

312
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,070
This is a better view

313
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,150
that handyman guy

314
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,245
that handyman guy

315
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,020
Now, watch this.

316
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,615
Now, watch this.

00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:38,985
(muttering indistinctly)

320
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,140
I dreamed I went to Manderley

321
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,355
I dreamed I went to Manderley

322
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,725
I dreamed I went to Manderley

323
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:46,060
What?

324
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,100
You were showing some interest

325
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,100
in "Rebecca," Herb.

326
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,095
in "Rebecca," Herb.

327
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,000
I never took you for a romantic.

328
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,465
I never took you for a romantic.

329
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:53,215
You -- You know this one

330
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:55,835
You -- You know this one

331
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:58,150
Word for word, almost.

332
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,205
Word for word, almost.

333
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,170
It's funny.

334
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,575
It's funny.

335
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:03,110
I can remember things like that,

336
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,210
but I can't remember

337
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:05,945
but I can't remember

338
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:08,020
like where I put my car keys.

339
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,315
like where I put my car keys.

340
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:11,030
(chuckles)

341
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,190
Did you check the ignition?

342
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:12,685
Did you check the ignition?

343
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,210
Oh...No, I --

344
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,055
Oh...No, I --

That was --

346
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,425
That was --

347
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:20,000
of the kinds of things

348
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,190
compared to the ki--

349
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:22,795
compared to the ki--

350
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:24,070
(chuckles)

351
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,140
You know what?

352
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:26,165
You know what?

355
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:31,115

You know what?

359
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:36,275
You know what?

360
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:38,130
They could probably go on like

361
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,645
They could probably go on like

362
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:41,130
So, let's take a look

363
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,015
So, let's take a look

364
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:44,060
It'll become important

365
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,385
It'll become important

366
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:47,110
I hope you find the keys.

367
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,100
Oh, okay.

368
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,125
Oh, okay.

Doris pays us $10 each

381
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:09,996
Her store smells

382
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,100
but not so bad

383
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,346
but not so bad

384
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:14,996
I guess.

385
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,050

Move on.

580
00:15:09,232 --> 00:15:09,911
God, they sound like dead cats.

581
00:15:09,911 --> 00:15:11,131
God, they sound like dead cats.

582
00:15:11,132 --> 00:15:13,281

Like who?

587
00:15:19,212 --> 00:15:20,021
Like me.

588
00:15:20,021 --> 00:15:21,011
I'm being honored for winning

589
00:15:21,012 --> 00:15:22,102
I'm being honored for winning

590
00:15:22,102 --> 00:15:23,391
And some others being

591
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,021
They're listed at the bottom.

592
00:15:25,022 --> 00:15:26,212
They're listed at the bottom.

593
00:15:26,212 --> 00:15:26,761
Unfortunately,

594
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:28,151
Unfortunately,

595
00:15:28,152 --> 00:15:30,131
my neighbor needs someone

596
00:15:30,131 --> 00:15:31,121
who just had this

597
00:15:31,122 --> 00:15:33,222
who just had this

598
00:15:33,222 --> 00:15:33,501
who just had this

599
00:15:33,501 --> 00:15:36,871
And of course I can't do it

600
00:15:36,871 --> 00:15:37,111
and because I have a date --

601
00:15:37,112 --> 00:15:40,092
and because I have a date --

602
00:15:40,092 --> 00:15:40,241
You probably don't know him

603
00:15:40,241 --> 00:15:42,101
You probably don't know him

604
00:15:42,102 --> 00:15:43,611
Jennifer?

605
00:15:43,611 --> 00:15:44,151
-[Jennifer] Hmm?

606
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:45,202
-[Jennifer] Hmm?

607
00:15:45,202 --> 00:15:46,981
I'm leaving in ten seconds even

608
00:15:46,981 --> 00:15:48,021
I'm leaving in ten seconds even

609
00:15:48,022 --> 00:15:50,351
Well, maybe you wouldn't mind

610
00:15:50,351 --> 00:15:51,231
Well, maybe you wouldn't mind

611
00:15:51,232 --> 00:15:53,721
to help an unfortunate

612
00:15:53,721 --> 00:15:56,101

You could order pizza

614
00:15:57,091 --> 00:15:58,181
You could order pizza

615
00:15:58,182 --> 00:16:00,461
and probably have

616
00:16:00,461 --> 00:16:01,201
and probably have

617
00:16:01,202 --> 00:16:03,831
Better even.

618
00:16:03,831 --> 00:16:04,001
After all, it's better

619
00:16:04,002 --> 00:16:05,072
After all, it's better

620
00:16:05,072 --> 00:16:07,201
and standing against the wall

621
00:16:07,201 --> 00:16:07,221

Plus some mushrooms

without being noticed.

632
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:24,111

but it was something

636
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:29,101
but it was something

637
00:16:29,102 --> 00:16:30,791
We'd love to help you out,

638
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:31,151

You and your dates.

Don't you think it's a little

659
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:11,022
Don't you think it's a little

660
00:17:11,022 --> 00:17:11,232
Jennifer we have dates when she

661
00:17:11,232 --> 00:17:13,162
Jennifer we have dates when she

662
00:17:13,162 --> 00:17:14,601

Summer was right, of course.

I wish I had different hair.

That's so cool.

736

He hit the trash cans.

737
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:57,032
He hit the trash cans.

738
00:19:57,032 --> 00:19:59,032
Well, that's the --

(Rod continues laughing)

742
00:20:03,103 --> 00:20:04,032
It looks like he's dead.

743
00:20:04,032 --> 00:20:06,472
Well, that's the other

744
00:20:06,473 --> 00:20:07,142
Well, that's the other

(laughs)

747
00:20:09,843 --> 00:20:12,123
Anyway,

748
00:20:13,142 --> 00:20:13,212
(laughs)

749
00:20:13,214 --> 00:20:14,192
Skip it.

750
00:20:14,192 --> 00:20:16,222
Skip it.

751
00:20:18,002 --> 00:20:19,142
[Tod] Hey, what'd they want?

752
00:20:19,142 --> 00:20:19,952
(chuckles) I don't know.

753
00:20:19,954 --> 00:20:21,132
(chuckles) I don't know.

754
00:20:21,132 --> 00:20:23,132
It's my fault, and I admit it.

755
00:20:23,132 --> 00:20:23,322
It's my fault, and I admit it.

756
00:20:23,324 --> 00:20:25,054
I say we just

757
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:26,692
I say we just

758
00:20:26,694 --> 00:20:29,122
So we get laughed at a little.

759
00:20:29,122 --> 00:20:30,062
So we get laughed at a little.

760
00:20:30,064 --> 00:20:32,232
There are worse things.

761
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:33,432
Yeah? Name one.

762
00:20:33,434 --> 00:20:34,182
Yeah? Name one.

763
00:20:34,182 --> 00:20:35,212
Shh!

764
00:20:35,212 --> 00:20:36,802
Doris having

765
00:20:36,804 --> 00:20:37,104
all of a sudden

766
00:20:40,222 --> 00:20:42,062
all of a sudden

767
00:20:44,032 --> 00:20:45,232
What was surprising is the way

768
00:20:45,232 --> 00:20:46,912
What was surprising is the way

769
00:20:46,914 --> 00:20:48,142
Not the way she said it,

770
00:20:48,142 --> 00:20:50,282
Not the way she said it,

771
00:20:50,284 --> 00:20:52,102
I wished for it.

772
00:20:52,102 --> 00:20:53,652
I wished for it.

773
00:20:53,654 --> 00:20:54,222
And I got it.

774
00:20:54,222 --> 00:20:57,022
Isn't it the strangest thing?

775
00:20:57,024 --> 00:20:57,092
Isn't it the strangest thing?

776
00:20:57,092 --> 00:20:59,132
Wanna touch it?

777
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,392
-[Marci] No, thanks.

778
00:21:00,394 --> 00:21:01,132
-[Marci] No, thanks.

779
00:21:01,132 --> 00:21:02,192
You girls notice

780
00:21:02,192 --> 00:21:03,762
You girls notice

781
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:05,042
unusual about me?

782
00:21:05,042 --> 00:21:07,132
Come on, girls.

783
00:21:07,134 --> 00:21:08,142
I'm sorry, Doris,

784
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:10,192
but it's really hard

785
00:21:12,042 --> 00:21:13,172
but it's really hard

786
00:21:15,022 --> 00:21:16,132
I don't have to

787
00:21:16,132 --> 00:21:17,242
I don't have to

788
00:21:17,244 --> 00:21:19,142
Watch this.

789
00:21:19,142 --> 00:21:20,612
"No user serviceable parts

790
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:22,142
"No user serviceable parts

792
00:21:23,232 --> 00:21:23,982
(Doris chuckles)

793
00:21:23,984 --> 00:21:27,132
"Opening case voids warranty."

794
00:21:27,132 --> 00:21:27,352
"Opening case voids warranty."

795
00:21:27,354 --> 00:21:29,182
(Doris giggles)

796
00:21:29,182 --> 00:21:30,722
(Doris giggles)

797
00:21:30,724 --> 00:21:32,092
Look, start, stop, start, stop.

798
00:21:32,092 --> 00:21:34,092
(laughs)

799
00:21:34,094 --> 00:21:34,142
(laughs)

800
00:21:34,142 --> 00:21:37,062
I have perfect vision

801
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:37,462
I have perfect vision

802
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:40,142
because I wished for it.

803
00:21:40,142 --> 00:21:40,832
because I wished for it.

804
00:21:40,834 --> 00:21:43,052
Smile, Marc.

805
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,202
Smile, Marc.

806
00:21:44,204 --> 00:21:46,022
Summer, hello!

807
00:21:46,022 --> 00:21:47,572
(laughs)

808
00:21:47,574 --> 00:21:49,062
(laughs)

809
00:21:49,062 --> 00:21:50,142
I think it has to do

810
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:50,942
I think it has to do

811
00:21:50,944 --> 00:21:52,222
Too many years

812
00:21:52,222 --> 00:21:54,312
Too many years

813
00:21:54,315 --> 00:21:56,182
Um, Doris, maybe you got

814
00:21:56,182 --> 00:21:57,682
Um, Doris, maybe you got

815
00:21:57,685 --> 00:22:00,062
and then just forgot

816
00:22:00,062 --> 00:22:01,052
and then just forgot

817
00:22:01,055 --> 00:22:04,062
Totally understandable.

818
00:22:04,062 --> 00:22:04,422
Totally understandable.

819
00:22:04,425 --> 00:22:06,002
Summer, remember the knight

820
00:22:06,002 --> 00:22:07,792
Summer, remember the knight

821
00:22:07,795 --> 00:22:08,052
Summer, think.

822
00:22:08,052 --> 00:22:11,162
Summer, think.

823
00:22:11,165 --> 00:22:13,102
I turned him into a real knight.

824
00:22:13,102 --> 00:22:14,532
I turned him into a real knight.

825
00:22:14,535 --> 00:22:15,102
He's in the back room.

826
00:22:15,102 --> 00:22:17,902
Come on, girls.

827
00:22:17,905 --> 00:22:18,022
Come on, girls.

828
00:22:18,022 --> 00:22:21,122
Come on, I'll show you.

829
00:22:21,122 --> 00:22:21,272
If this ever happens to me,

830
00:22:21,275 --> 00:22:22,202
If this ever happens to me,

831
00:22:22,202 --> 00:22:24,082
(giggling)

832
00:22:24,082 --> 00:22:24,642

(music playing)

835
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:30,152
Ta-da!

836
00:22:30,152 --> 00:22:31,382
Ta-da!

837
00:22:31,385 --> 00:22:33,182
(laughs)

838
00:22:33,182 --> 00:22:34,752
Oh. Oh, no. He --

839
00:22:34,755 --> 00:22:35,102
Oh. Oh, no. He --

840
00:22:35,102 --> 00:22:37,222
He must've gone out when --

841
00:22:39,222 --> 00:22:41,492
He must've gone out when --

842
00:22:41,495 --> 00:22:42,222
Yes. See? The back door's open.

843
00:22:42,222 --> 00:22:44,862
He's -- He's gone out.

844
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:46,052
He's -- He's gone out.

845
00:22:46,052 --> 00:22:47,222
Here, Summer, here, you try.

846
00:22:47,222 --> 00:22:48,232
Make a wish, anything,

847
00:22:48,235 --> 00:22:49,095
Make a wish, anything,

848
00:22:52,092 --> 00:22:54,102
Okay.

849
00:22:54,102 --> 00:22:54,972
Okay.

850
00:22:54,975 --> 00:22:58,082
Um...

851
00:22:58,082 --> 00:22:58,342
I wish for a couple of cool guys

852
00:22:58,345 --> 00:23:00,022
I wish for a couple of cool guys

853
00:23:00,022 --> 00:23:01,182
so we don't get laughed at.

854
00:23:01,182 --> 00:23:01,712
so we don't get laughed at.

855
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:04,182
Summer, I said I was sorry.

856
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:05,082
Okay?

857
00:23:05,085 --> 00:23:06,082
Okay?

858
00:23:06,082 --> 00:23:08,192
Maybe there's cool guys

859
00:23:08,192 --> 00:23:08,452
...open an artery over it?

860
00:23:08,455 --> 00:23:10,122
...open an artery over it?

861
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:11,122
No, I don't want you to open

862
00:23:11,122 --> 00:23:11,822
You wouldn't do it anyways.

863
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:13,022
You wouldn't do it anyways.

864
00:23:13,022 --> 00:23:14,182
[Marci]

865
00:23:14,182 --> 00:23:15,192
You are so obsessed

866
00:23:15,195 --> 00:23:15,222
You are so obsessed

867
00:23:15,222 --> 00:23:18,082
All those guys think...

868
00:23:18,082 --> 00:23:18,562
All those guys think...

869
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:20,062
I wish they had boys to...

870
00:23:20,062 --> 00:23:21,932
whatever it was they wanted.

871
00:23:21,935 --> 00:23:22,062
(Summer shouting indistinctly)

872
00:23:22,062 --> 00:23:24,052

874
00:23:25,182 --> 00:23:25,302
Um, Doris?

875
00:23:25,305 --> 00:23:28,225
Um, Doris?

876
00:23:36,132 --> 00:23:38,112
"Carlton Plaza" is on.

877
00:23:52,002 --> 00:23:52,262
Uh, why don't you sit here

878
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:54,176
Uh, why don't you sit here

879
00:23:56,012 --> 00:23:58,032
Sorry.

880

882
00:24:01,132 --> 00:24:02,152
I'll turn it on.

883
00:24:02,152 --> 00:24:02,372
And we can come back when

884
00:24:02,376 --> 00:24:04,002
And we can come back when

885
00:24:04,002 --> 00:24:05,132
(gasps) Maybe...

886
00:24:05,132 --> 00:24:05,742
(gasps) Maybe...

887
00:24:05,746 --> 00:24:08,162
three wishes.

888
00:24:08,162 --> 00:24:09,112
three wishes.

889
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:11,142
I -- I made three wishes,

890
00:24:11,142 --> 00:24:12,482
I -- I made three wishes,

891
00:24:12,486 --> 00:24:13,036
and that's all you usually get.

892
00:24:15,082 --> 00:24:15,852
and that's all you usually get.

893
00:24:15,856 --> 00:24:18,032
I wasted one on hair

894
00:24:18,032 --> 00:24:19,222
I wasted one on hair

895
00:24:19,226 --> 00:24:20,096
and one on a knight

896
00:24:22,102 --> 00:24:22,592
and one on a knight

897
00:24:22,596 --> 00:24:25,052
So, we're gonna go now.

898
00:24:25,052 --> 00:24:25,962
So, we're gonna go now.

899
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:27,086

This isn't you talking, Monica.

It's some stranger

922
00:25:03,036 --> 00:25:04,232
You've tormented me

923
00:25:04,232 --> 00:25:06,402
You've tormented me

924
00:25:06,406 --> 00:25:08,172
threatening to ruin me

925
00:25:08,172 --> 00:25:09,772
threatening to ruin me

926
00:25:09,776 --> 00:25:11,212
Maybe I'm wishing the wrong way.

927
00:25:11,212 --> 00:25:13,142
Maybe I'm wishing the wrong way.

928
00:25:13,146 --> 00:25:15,122
It's too late

929
00:25:15,122 --> 00:25:16,517
It's too late

930

Don't you think it's scary?

958

I mean, don't you ever worry

00:26:03,102 --> 00:26:03,697
We are not gonna turn

962
00:26:03,697 --> 00:26:06,182
That so won't happen.

963
00:26:06,182 --> 00:26:07,067
That so won't happen.

964
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:10,052
How do you know?

965
00:26:10,052 --> 00:26:10,437
I mean, I bet even Doris

966
00:26:10,437 --> 00:26:12,022
I mean, I bet even Doris

967
00:26:12,022 --> 00:26:13,072
she was gonna turn into Doris.

968
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:13,807
she was gonna turn into Doris.

969
00:26:13,807 --> 00:26:15,072
Summer, there are lots of

970
00:26:15,072 --> 00:26:17,177
why we won't turn into Doris.

971
00:26:17,177 --> 00:26:17,212
why we won't turn into Doris.

972
00:26:17,212 --> 00:26:19,142
Name one.

973
00:26:19,142 --> 00:26:20,547
Name one.

974
00:26:20,547 --> 00:26:22,102
Okay.

975
00:26:22,102 --> 00:26:23,917
In 11 months for me,

976
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:24,132
In 11 months for me,

977
00:26:24,132 --> 00:26:25,222
we are gonna have totally

978
00:26:25,222 --> 00:26:27,287
and correct jaw lines.

979
00:26:27,287 --> 00:26:28,122
and correct jaw lines.

980
00:26:28,122 --> 00:26:30,052
There's one right there.

981
00:26:30,052 --> 00:26:30,657
Name another one.

982
00:26:30,657 --> 00:26:31,142
Name another one.

983
00:26:31,142 --> 00:26:33,102
We both got our own kidneys.

984
00:26:33,102 --> 00:26:34,027
(tires screech,

985
00:26:34,027 --> 00:26:35,012
(tires screech,

986
00:26:35,012 --> 00:26:36,102
[Doris] Yoo-hoo! Girls!

987
00:26:36,102 --> 00:26:37,397
[Doris] Yoo-hoo! Girls!

988
00:26:37,397 --> 00:26:38,062
Woo! (laughs)

989
00:26:38,062 --> 00:26:40,767
Woo! (laughs)

990
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:41,077
Girls!

991
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:44,137
I'm gonna get my mom, Marci,

992
00:26:44,137 --> 00:26:45,017
I'm gonna get my mom, Marci,

993
00:26:46,082 --> 00:26:47,202
-[Doris] Yoo-hoo,

994
00:26:47,202 --> 00:26:47,507
-[Doris] Yoo-hoo,

995
00:26:47,507 --> 00:26:49,182
That's not Doris.

996
00:26:49,182 --> 00:26:50,877
Oh, my gosh.

997
00:26:50,877 --> 00:26:52,102
Oh, my gosh.

998
00:26:52,102 --> 00:26:54,182
That's popular daytime

999
00:26:54,182 --> 00:26:54,247
That's popular daytime

1000
00:26:54,247 --> 00:26:56,182
Ta-dah!

1001
00:26:56,182 --> 00:26:57,618
Why are you in Doris's car?

1002
00:26:57,618 --> 00:27:00,068
Why are you in Doris's car?

1003
00:27:01,222 --> 00:27:03,142
[Doris] Because, I'm Doris.

1004
00:27:03,142 --> 00:27:04,358
[Doris] Because, I'm Doris.

1005
00:27:04,358 --> 00:27:05,018
I can explain.

1006
00:27:05,022 --> 00:27:07,728
You can try.

1007
00:27:07,728 --> 00:27:08,048
You can try.

1008
00:27:09,182 --> 00:27:11,082
(music playing)

1009
00:27:11,082 --> 00:27:11,098
(music playing)

1010
00:27:11,098 --> 00:27:12,228
It wasn't the -- Oh.

1011
00:27:12,232 --> 00:27:14,468
It wasn't the three wishes thing

1012
00:27:14,468 --> 00:27:14,998
It wasn't the three wishes thing

1013
00:27:15,002 --> 00:27:17,032
It was the Cinderella thing.

1014
00:27:17,032 --> 00:27:17,838
Did the fairy godmother

1015
00:27:17,838 --> 00:27:19,128
Did the fairy godmother

1016
00:27:19,132 --> 00:27:21,162
out of thin air?

1017
00:27:21,162 --> 00:27:21,208
out of thin air?

1018
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:24,148
No!

1019
00:27:24,152 --> 00:27:24,578
No!

1020
00:27:24,578 --> 00:27:25,998
She had to make something

1021
00:27:26,002 --> 00:27:27,948
So she turned a pumpkin and mice

1022
00:27:27,948 --> 00:27:28,218
So she turned a pumpkin and mice

1023
00:27:28,222 --> 00:27:31,102
So she turned a pumpkin and mice

1024
00:27:31,102 --> 00:27:31,318
And you turned yourself

1025
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:34,688
And you turned yourself

1026
00:27:34,688 --> 00:27:36,018
Well, not all at once,

1027
00:27:36,022 --> 00:27:38,058
First I got the legs.

1028
00:27:38,058 --> 00:27:39,018
First I got the legs.

1029
00:27:39,022 --> 00:27:41,192
And they came...

1030
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:41,428
And they came...

1031
00:27:41,428 --> 00:27:44,188
with heels and pantyhose.

1032
00:27:44,192 --> 00:27:44,798
with heels and pantyhose.

1033
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:45,188
And then, bit by bit,

1034
00:27:45,192 --> 00:27:48,168
And then, bit by bit,

1035
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:49,168
I got the bow

1036
00:27:49,172 --> 00:27:51,538
I got the bow

1037
00:27:51,538 --> 00:27:52,118
(laughs)

1038
00:27:52,122 --> 00:27:54,908
You know, things like this,

1039
00:27:54,908 --> 00:27:55,198
You know, things like this,

1040
00:27:55,202 --> 00:27:58,022
once you start

1041
00:27:58,022 --> 00:27:58,278
And the clothes?

1042
00:27:58,278 --> 00:27:59,058
And the clothes?

1043
00:27:59,062 --> 00:28:01,122
Well, I don't know.

1044
00:28:01,122 --> 00:28:01,648
Well, I don't know.

1045
00:28:01,648 --> 00:28:03,138
Maybe it's like Barbie.

1046
00:28:03,142 --> 00:28:05,018
[Marci] That kinda made sense.

1047
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:05,208
[Marci] That kinda made sense.

1048
00:28:05,212 --> 00:28:08,082
I mean Barbie always did come

1049
00:28:08,082 --> 00:28:08,388
I mean Barbie always did come

1050
00:28:08,388 --> 00:28:10,078
(exhales sharply) If you're,

1051
00:28:10,082 --> 00:28:11,758
(exhales sharply) If you're,

1052
00:28:11,758 --> 00:28:14,138
(exhales sharply) If you're,

1053
00:28:14,142 --> 00:28:15,128
Well, who else

1054
00:28:15,128 --> 00:28:18,498
Well, who else

1055
00:28:18,498 --> 00:28:20,038
a semi-restored 1956

1056
00:28:20,042 --> 00:28:21,868
a semi-restored 1956

1057
00:28:21,868 --> 00:28:24,058
You could've stolen it.

1058
00:28:24,062 --> 00:28:25,238
You could've stolen it.

1059
00:28:25,238 --> 00:28:27,198
Good one, Summer.

1060
00:28:27,202 --> 00:28:28,608
Tell us something

1061
00:28:28,608 --> 00:28:29,128
Tell us something

1062
00:28:29,132 --> 00:28:31,032
You two are desperate for dates

1063
00:28:31,032 --> 00:28:31,978
You two are desperate for dates

1064
00:28:31,978 --> 00:28:34,118
because you don't have any

1065
00:28:37,152 --> 00:28:38,719
because you don't have any

1066
00:28:38,719 --> 00:28:40,079
Everyone  so  knows!

1067
00:28:40,082 --> 00:28:42,089
Everyone  so  knows!

1068
00:28:42,089 --> 00:28:43,169
-[Summer] Oh!

1069
00:28:43,172 --> 00:28:45,459
I'm not finished.

1070
00:28:45,459 --> 00:28:46,019
I'm not finished.

1071
00:28:46,022 --> 00:28:48,052
No, but we are. Mom!

1072
00:28:48,052 --> 00:28:48,829
Swear to God, Marci, I am

1073
00:28:48,829 --> 00:28:49,059
Swear to God, Marci, I am

1074
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:51,082
Summer.

1075
00:28:51,082 --> 00:28:52,199
Summer.

1076
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:55,029
[Doris] Aren't they cute?

1077
00:28:55,032 --> 00:28:55,569
[Doris] Aren't they cute?

1078
00:28:55,569 --> 00:28:56,059
Isn't this what you wanted?

1079
00:28:58,182 --> 00:28:58,939
Isn't this what you wanted?

1080
00:28:58,939 --> 00:29:02,059
-[Judy] Summer!

1081
00:29:02,062 --> 00:29:02,309
-[Judy] Summer!

1082
00:29:02,309 --> 00:29:04,209
Here's some crackers.

1083
00:29:04,212 --> 00:29:05,679
Here's some crackers.

1084
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,099
[Judy] Summer?

1085
00:29:08,102 --> 00:29:09,049
[Doris]

1086
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:09,149
[Judy]

1087
00:29:09,152 --> 00:29:10,222
[Judy]

1088
00:29:10,222 --> 00:29:11,222
Ooh, athletic too.

1089
00:29:11,222 --> 00:29:12,419
Ooh, athletic too.

1090
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:14,089
Here, you're gonna need these.

1091
00:29:14,092 --> 00:29:15,789
Bye!

1092
00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:17,029
[Marci] Wait.

1093
00:29:17,032 --> 00:29:18,182
[Marci] Wait.

1094
00:29:20,212 --> 00:29:22,112
-[Judy] You sounded --

1095
00:29:22,112 --> 00:29:22,529
-[Judy] You sounded --

1096
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:24,159
-[Summer] It was a mistake.

1097
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:25,899
[Marci] What?!

1098
00:29:25,899 --> 00:29:26,099
Who are they?

1099
00:29:26,102 --> 00:29:28,032
Who are they?

1100
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:29,192
Uh...

1101
00:29:32,012 --> 00:29:32,639
these guys.

1102
00:29:32,639 --> 00:29:33,209
these guys.

1103
00:29:33,212 --> 00:29:35,022
Oh, do I know them?

1104
00:29:35,022 --> 00:29:36,009
Oh, probably not.

1105
00:29:36,009 --> 00:29:36,169
Oh, probably not.

1106
00:29:36,172 --> 00:29:38,132
Summer, can I see you a sec?

1107
00:29:38,132 --> 00:29:39,379
Oh, would they like to come in?

1108
00:29:39,379 --> 00:29:40,019
Oh, would they like to come in?

1109
00:29:40,022 --> 00:29:42,182
I don't actually, like, know.

1110
00:29:42,182 --> 00:29:42,749
I don't actually, like, know.

1111
00:29:42,749 --> 00:29:44,069
Summer!

1112
00:29:44,072 --> 00:29:46,119
You know we like

1113
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:46,209
Ask them in.

1114
00:29:46,212 --> 00:29:47,232
Ask them in.

1115
00:29:47,232 --> 00:29:49,222
Oh, I know what it's like

1116
00:29:49,222 --> 00:29:49,489
Oh, I know what it's like

I'll be cool.

1118
00:29:51,182 --> 00:29:52,859
Summer!

1119
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:55,109
Summer!

1120
00:29:55,112 --> 00:29:56,112
(both chuckles nervously)

1121
00:29:56,112 --> 00:29:56,229
-[Marci] Whoa.

1122
00:29:56,229 --> 00:29:57,109
-[Marci] Whoa.

00:29:57,112 --> 00:29:59,112
Really gotta tell you something.

1124
00:29:59,112 --> 00:29:59,599
Really gotta tell you something.

1125
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:01,139

-[Summer] Where did

1128
00:30:03,112 --> 00:30:05,132
She wasn't joking about

1129
00:30:05,132 --> 00:30:06,339
Hello, boys.

1130
00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:07,119
Hello, boys.

1131
00:30:07,122 --> 00:30:09,182

They're rats?

1134
00:30:11,212 --> 00:30:13,079
Summer, that's not cute.

1135
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:14,069
Summer, that's not cute.

1136
00:30:14,072 --> 00:30:15,172
And who are you?

1137
00:30:15,172 --> 00:30:16,449
Oh, um, they -- they, you know,

00:30:16,449 --> 00:30:17,159
Oh, um, they -- they, you know,

Oh.

1143
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,930
Are these the boys I read

1144
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:30,130
Are these the boys I read

1145
00:30:30,132 --> 00:30:32,012
Hmm? The foreign

1146

[Judy]

1176
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,030
It's hard enough

1177
00:31:14,032 --> 00:31:15,072
It's hard enough

1178
00:31:15,072 --> 00:31:16,182

1179
00:31:16,182 --> 00:31:17,110

1180
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,040
...without people being rude.

1181

It's a well-known fact

1185
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:26,060

So, I'll just be outside,

1191
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,068
So, I'll just be outside,

She's not there.

1201
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:29,249
Well, where is she?

Well, where is she?

Summer, how am

1205
00:32:35,989 --> 00:32:36,889
Like, she's got a hot bod,

1206
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:39,359
anything could happen,

1207
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:39,739
anything could happen,

1208
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,900
Summer, it's not polite

1209
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,729
Summer, it's not polite

1210
00:32:42,729 --> 00:32:44,789
so you can talk on the phone.

1211
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,099

1217
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:52,839
Personally, I never eat

1218
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:53,879
Personally, I never eat

1219
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,900

I just can't get by it.

1222
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,840
But it is so obvious that not

1223
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,319
But it is so obvious that not

So we keep feeding them

1656
00:44:13,586 --> 00:44:13,786

1657
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:16,750
and that'll keep their mind

1658
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:16,956

None of my other friends

And since obviously nobody was,

1683
00:58:43,297 --> 00:58:44,193
I had only ever sneaked out

1684
00:58:44,193 --> 00:58:46,663
I had only ever sneaked out

1685
00:58:46,667 --> 00:58:48,043
But I only got caught once.

1686
00:58:48,043 --> 00:58:50,033
But I only got caught once.

1687
00:58:50,037 --> 00:58:53,043
Aah!

1688
00:58:53,043 --> 00:58:53,403
Shh.

1689
00:58:53,407 --> 00:58:56,213
Shh.

1690
00:58:56,213 --> 00:58:56,773
Herb, just take your evidence,

I can't imagine that

1697
00:59:10,258 --> 00:59:11,163
I can't imagine that

1698
00:59:11,163 --> 00:59:13,173
Well, frankly I doubt

Whatever this is all about,

1701
00:59:16,203 --> 00:59:16,998
I'm sure it had nothing to do

1702
00:59:16,998 --> 00:59:19,023
I'm sure it had nothing to do

Oh.

That's the second time today

1707
00:59:23,738 --> 00:59:26,013
That's the second time today

1708
00:59:26,013 --> 00:59:27,043
I just saw you on TV.

1709
00:59:27,043 --> 00:59:27,108
Yeah, everyone thinks

1710
00:59:27,108 --> 00:59:28,173
Yeah, everyone thinks

1711
00:59:28,173 --> 00:59:30,478
Um, do you think that maybe

1712
00:59:30,478 --> 00:59:31,203
Um, do you think that maybe

1713
00:59:31,203 --> 00:59:33,113
you're telling

1714
00:59:33,113 --> 00:59:33,848
you're telling

1715
00:59:33,848 --> 00:59:36,163
Yeah, well,

1716
00:59:36,163 --> 00:59:37,218
Yeah, well,

1717
00:59:37,218 --> 00:59:39,183
Doris, look, okay, you're

1718
00:59:39,183 --> 00:59:40,588
Doris, look, okay, you're

1719
00:59:40,588 --> 00:59:41,073
pretending to be

1720
00:59:41,073 --> 00:59:43,958
pretending to be

1721
00:59:43,958 --> 00:59:44,033
Yeah, you're right.

1722
00:59:44,033 --> 00:59:47,328
I'm gonna turn everything

1723
00:59:47,328 --> 00:59:49,203
I'm gonna turn everything

1724
00:59:49,203 --> 00:59:50,698
It's the best thing.

1725
00:59:50,698 --> 00:59:52,003
Go back to being myself.

1726
00:59:52,003 --> 00:59:53,073
Go back to being myself.

1727
00:59:53,073 --> 00:59:54,068
Now you're making sense.

1728
00:59:54,068 --> 00:59:54,163
Turn those boys back into rats.

1729
00:59:54,163 --> 00:59:57,003
Turn those boys back into rats.

1730
00:59:57,003 --> 00:59:57,438
(sighs)

1731
00:59:57,438 --> 00:59:58,163
Don't overreact.

1732
00:59:58,163 --> 01:00:00,103
Don't overreact.

1733
01:00:00,103 --> 01:00:00,808
Um, your part of the deal

1734
01:00:00,808 --> 01:00:02,173
Um, your part of the deal

1735
01:00:02,173 --> 01:00:03,203
But Summer and me, our part

1736
01:00:03,203 --> 01:00:04,178
But Summer and me, our part

1737
01:00:04,178 --> 01:00:06,003
But Summer and me, our part

1738
01:00:06,003 --> 01:00:07,548
-(indistinct shouting)

1739
01:00:07,548 --> 01:00:10,203
Oh, um, Herb the handyman guy,

1740
01:00:10,203 --> 01:00:10,918
Oh, um, Herb the handyman guy,

1741
01:00:10,918 --> 01:00:14,288
-[Doris] (gasps) Oh!

1742
01:00:14,288 --> 01:00:15,213
-[Doris] (gasps) Oh!

1743
01:00:15,213 --> 01:00:17,163
First we've got to go

1744
01:00:17,163 --> 01:00:17,658
We have to take a little ride,

1745
01:00:17,658 --> 01:00:21,003
We have to take a little ride,

1746
01:00:21,003 --> 01:00:21,028
Just go get in the car.

1747
01:00:21,028 --> 01:00:23,043
Just go get in the car.

1748
01:00:23,043 --> 01:00:24,153
But I'm alive,

1749
01:00:24,153 --> 01:00:24,398
But I'm alive,

1750
01:00:24,398 --> 01:00:26,163
Looked in the mirror lately?

1751
01:00:26,163 --> 01:00:27,768
Oh, yeah.

1752
01:00:27,768 --> 01:00:28,163
Oh, yeah.

1753
01:00:28,163 --> 01:00:31,138
Oh. (chuckles)

1754
01:00:31,138 --> 01:00:31,203
It's Doris they think is killed,

1755
01:00:31,203 --> 01:00:33,173
It's Doris they think is killed,

1756
01:00:33,173 --> 01:00:34,508
and Herb thinks that you did it.

1757
01:00:34,508 --> 01:00:35,163
Just use the ring,

1758
01:00:35,163 --> 01:00:36,183
Just use the ring,

1759
01:00:36,183 --> 01:00:37,878
and then show them.

1760
01:00:37,878 --> 01:00:38,213
and then show them.

1761
01:00:38,213 --> 01:00:41,013
Oh.

1762
01:00:41,013 --> 01:00:41,248
About the ring...

1763
01:00:41,248 --> 01:00:44,083
About the ring...

1764
01:00:44,083 --> 01:00:44,619
[Marci] Lost it!

1765
01:00:44,619 --> 01:00:45,099
(dog barking in distance)

1766
01:00:45,103 --> 01:00:46,993
(dog barking in distance)

1767
01:00:46,993 --> 01:00:47,989
Yes.

1768
01:00:47,989 --> 01:00:48,979
You have to help me find it.

1769
01:00:48,983 --> 01:00:51,063
You have to help me find it.

1770
01:00:51,063 --> 01:00:51,359
I'm absolutely positive

1771
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:53,099
I'm absolutely positive

1772
01:00:53,103 --> 01:00:54,163
or at the market, or --

1773
01:00:54,163 --> 01:00:54,729
or back at my store, or --

1774
01:00:54,729 --> 01:00:56,079
or back at my store, or --

1775
01:00:56,083 --> 01:00:58,099
but, anyway,

1776
01:00:58,099 --> 01:00:59,079
but, anyway,

1777
01:00:59,083 --> 01:01:01,043
and I'll take everything else.

1778
01:01:01,043 --> 01:01:01,469
But I -- I'm grounded.

1779
01:01:01,469 --> 01:01:03,979
But I -- I'm grounded.

1780
01:01:03,983 --> 01:01:04,839
And besides, I was just

1781
01:01:04,839 --> 01:01:06,119
And besides, I was just

1782
01:01:06,123 --> 01:01:08,033
And besides, I was just

1783
01:01:08,033 --> 01:01:08,209
[Doris] Marce, please.

1784
01:01:08,209 --> 01:01:11,179
[Doris] Marce, please.

1785
01:01:11,183 --> 01:01:11,579
Please?

1786
01:01:11,579 --> 01:01:14,949
(music playing)

1787
01:01:14,949 --> 01:01:15,129
(music playing)

1788
01:01:15,133 --> 01:01:18,319
Everybody's gonna be

1789
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:19,079
Everybody's gonna be

1790
01:01:19,083 --> 01:01:21,043
I so can't believe it.

1791
01:01:21,043 --> 01:01:21,689
I so can't believe it.

1792
01:01:21,689 --> 01:01:22,989
They're talking?

1793
01:01:28,093 --> 01:01:28,429
You look so good in pink.

1794
01:01:28,429 --> 01:01:30,179
You look so good in pink.

1795
01:01:30,183 --> 01:01:31,799
I'm so not believing it.

1796
01:01:31,799 --> 01:01:32,079
(giggles)

1797
01:01:33,113 --> 01:01:34,113
(giggles)

1798
01:01:34,113 --> 01:01:35,169
Oh, my God, you guys.

1799
01:01:35,169 --> 01:01:35,979
Spike and Scooter had

1800
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:37,163
Spike and Scooter had

1801
01:01:37,163 --> 01:01:38,539
that belonged

1802
01:01:38,539 --> 01:01:39,069
Steve, who joined the army.

1803
01:01:39,073 --> 01:01:41,083
Steve, who joined the army.

1804
01:01:41,083 --> 01:01:41,909
[Summer] No!

1805
01:01:41,909 --> 01:01:43,109
[Summer] No!

1806
01:01:43,113 --> 01:01:45,043
(music playing)

1807
01:01:45,043 --> 01:01:45,279
The fact that they had

1808
01:01:45,279 --> 01:01:48,029
The fact that they had

1809
01:01:48,033 --> 01:01:48,649
instead of eating

1810
01:01:48,649 --> 01:01:49,099
instead of eating

1811
01:01:49,103 --> 01:01:51,183
that things were now

1812
01:01:51,183 --> 01:01:52,019
that things were now

1813
01:01:52,019 --> 01:01:54,079
Get back. Get back.

1814
01:01:54,083 --> 01:01:55,389
Yo, Ding Dongs.

1815
01:01:55,389 --> 01:01:57,009
Yo, Ding Dongs.

1816
01:01:57,013 --> 01:01:58,759
I'm there.

1817
01:01:58,759 --> 01:01:59,149
I'm there.

1818
01:01:59,153 --> 01:02:01,203
[Judy]

1819
01:02:01,203 --> 01:02:02,129
[Judy]

1820
01:02:02,129 --> 01:02:05,159
Okay.

1821
01:02:05,163 --> 01:02:05,499
Okay.

1822
01:02:05,499 --> 01:02:07,089
So that's Marci, so we're going

1823
01:02:10,133 --> 01:02:12,239
So that's Marci, so we're going

1824
01:02:12,239 --> 01:02:13,119
No talking.

1827
01:02:16,013 --> 01:02:18,979
I didn't know you two

1828
01:02:18,979 --> 01:02:20,049
I didn't know you two

1829
01:02:20,053 --> 01:02:21,983
(chuckles) Only since forever.

1830
01:02:21,983 --> 01:02:22,349
Girlfriend, hi.

1831
01:02:22,349 --> 01:02:25,009
Girlfriend, hi.

1832
01:02:30,153 --> 01:02:32,460
[Judy] We are so proud of you

1833
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:33,120
Junior Miss Indiana, Jennifer.

1834
01:02:33,123 --> 01:02:35,033
Junior Miss Indiana, Jennifer.

1835
01:02:35,033 --> 01:02:35,830
I know, everybody is.

1836
01:02:35,830 --> 01:02:37,040
-[Jennifer] Airbag.

1837
01:02:37,043 --> 01:02:39,043
-[Jennifer] Airbag.

1838
01:02:39,043 --> 01:02:39,200
-[Jennifer] Airbag.

1839
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,180
Oh, the boys are back.

1840
01:02:40,183 --> 01:02:42,163
Me and Marci were

1841
01:02:42,163 --> 01:02:42,570
Me and Marci were

1842
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:45,940
Oh, poor Marci.

1843
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:46,030
Oh, poor Marci.

1844
01:02:46,033 --> 01:02:49,083
She's been grounded.

1845
01:02:49,083 --> 01:02:49,310
At least, that's

1846
01:02:49,310 --> 01:02:51,200
At least, that's

1847
01:02:51,203 --> 01:02:52,680
so, I thought, why don't

1848
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:54,050
so, I thought, why don't

1849
01:02:54,053 --> 01:02:55,143
and the boys too.

1850
01:02:55,143 --> 01:02:56,050
I mean if they were here.

1851
01:02:56,050 --> 01:02:57,160
I mean if they were here.

1852
01:02:57,163 --> 01:02:59,420
Randy Frasier's

1853
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:00,020
He's a junior

1854
01:03:00,023 --> 01:03:01,173
He's a junior

1855
01:03:01,173 --> 01:03:02,790
And, as he's my former

1856
01:03:02,790 --> 01:03:03,190
And, as he's my former

1857
01:03:03,193 --> 01:03:05,133
When did you break up?

1858
01:03:05,133 --> 01:03:06,160
Some time tonight.

1859
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:07,990
Some time tonight.

1860
01:03:07,993 --> 01:03:09,530
Oh.

1861
01:03:09,530 --> 01:03:11,160
-[Scooter] No talking.

1862
01:03:11,163 --> 01:03:12,203
No. He's right.

1863
01:03:12,203 --> 01:03:12,900
No. He's right.

1864
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:14,080
No. He's right.

1865
01:03:14,083 --> 01:03:15,113
Randy should be the first

1866
01:03:15,113 --> 01:03:16,213
He's been loyal,

1867
01:03:16,213 --> 01:03:16,270
He's been loyal,

1868
01:03:16,270 --> 01:03:19,640
He's been loyal,

1869
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:19,980
But in the meantime,

1870
01:03:19,983 --> 01:03:23,003
I thought you guys might like

1871
01:03:23,003 --> 01:03:23,010
I thought you guys might like

1872
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:26,380
[Judy] Oh.

1873
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:27,040
You're so obsessed

1874
01:03:27,043 --> 01:03:28,163
You're so obsessed

1875
01:03:28,163 --> 01:03:29,750
I so can't believe it.

1876
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:30,170
I guess it's a yes.

1877
01:03:30,173 --> 01:03:32,003
Don't worry, Mrs. Weingarten,

1878
01:03:32,003 --> 01:03:33,120
Don't worry, Mrs. Weingarten,

1879
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:33,150
I get that all the time.

1880
01:03:33,153 --> 01:03:35,153
I get that all the time.

1881
01:03:35,153 --> 01:03:36,173
Well, as long as Marci's

1882
01:03:36,173 --> 01:03:36,490
Come on, girlfriend.

1883
01:03:36,490 --> 01:03:37,200
Come on, girlfriend.

1884
01:03:37,203 --> 01:03:39,860
I'm so not obsessed

1885
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:40,180
You can be with Summer then.

1886
01:03:40,183 --> 01:03:43,123
You can be with Summer then.

(siren wailing in distance)

1893
01:03:49,970 --> 01:03:51,040
Okay, Herb, I want you

1894
01:03:51,043 --> 01:03:52,163
Okay, Herb, I want you

1895
01:03:54,063 --> 01:03:56,023
Just have a seat.

1896
01:03:56,023 --> 01:03:56,710
Yeah, it's Henderson.

1897
01:03:56,710 --> 01:03:58,200
Yeah, it's Henderson.

1898
01:03:58,203 --> 01:04:00,080
Uh, I got that guy

1899
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:00,090
Uh, I got that guy

1900
01:04:00,093 --> 01:04:01,143
He's waiting here in the lobby.

1901
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:06,821
Just send somebody down,

1902
01:04:06,821 --> 01:04:07,171
pick him up and take him

1903
01:04:07,173 --> 01:04:10,191
pick him up and take him

1904
01:04:10,191 --> 01:04:11,001
Okay?

1905
01:04:11,003 --> 01:04:12,003
Just a second.

1906
01:04:12,003 --> 01:04:13,083
Somebody ripped off

1907
01:04:13,083 --> 01:04:13,561
Somebody ripped off

1908
01:04:13,561 --> 01:04:14,181
I want justice.

1909
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:15,203
I want justice.

1910
01:04:17,133 --> 01:04:18,143
Hello?

1911
01:04:23,183 --> 01:04:23,671
Hey. Hey, get out here.

1912
01:04:23,671 --> 01:04:26,051
Hey. Hey, get out here.

1913
01:04:26,053 --> 01:04:27,041
Get off your coffee break.

1914
01:04:27,041 --> 01:04:28,101
It's time to deal with me.

1915
01:04:28,103 --> 01:04:29,163
It's time to deal with me.

1916
01:04:29,163 --> 01:04:30,411
Come on, I can't play my --

1917
01:04:30,411 --> 01:04:31,151
H-Have a seat right here.

1918
01:04:31,153 --> 01:04:32,153
Someone will be --

1919
01:04:32,153 --> 01:04:33,781
Someone will be --

1920
01:04:33,781 --> 01:04:34,161
I'm bummed, man.

1921
01:04:34,163 --> 01:04:36,083
I'm bummed, man.

1922
01:04:39,103 --> 01:04:40,173
Understandable. Mm-hmm.

1923
01:04:40,173 --> 01:04:40,521
Come with me, please.

1924
01:04:40,521 --> 01:04:43,121
Come with me, please.

1925
01:04:43,123 --> 01:04:43,891
Yo. That was fast.

1926
01:04:43,891 --> 01:04:44,201
I got four months left

1927
01:04:44,203 --> 01:04:47,113
I got four months left

1928
01:04:53,153 --> 01:04:54,001
It's expensive.

1929
01:04:54,001 --> 01:04:55,061
(music playing)

1930
01:04:55,063 --> 01:04:57,073
(music playing)

1931
01:04:57,073 --> 01:04:57,371
(telephone ringing)

1932
01:04:57,371 --> 01:04:59,021
Hello?

1933
01:04:59,023 --> 01:05:00,123
Hello?

1934
01:05:06,013 --> 01:05:07,481
Yes, yes, Rod, yes

1935
01:05:07,481 --> 01:05:08,021
Yes, yes, Rod, yes

1936
01:05:08,023 --> 01:05:10,133
Uh, no. No, I don't think

1937
01:05:10,133 --> 01:05:10,851
Uh, no. No, I don't think

1938
01:05:10,851 --> 01:05:12,131
-[Rod] Tod.

1939
01:05:12,133 --> 01:05:14,221
-[Rod] Tod.

1940
01:05:14,221 --> 01:05:15,141
-[Donna] Well, you're Rod.

1941
01:05:15,143 --> 01:05:17,591
[Rod] Marci came over

1942
01:05:17,591 --> 01:05:20,021
[Rod] Marci came over

1943
01:05:20,023 --> 01:05:20,961
-[Donna] Excuse me?

1944
01:05:20,961 --> 01:05:21,201
-[Donna] The what?

1945
01:05:21,203 --> 01:05:24,163
-[Donna] The what?

1946
01:05:24,163 --> 01:05:24,331
I don't know anything

1947
01:05:24,331 --> 01:05:26,031
I don't know anything

1948
01:05:26,033 --> 01:05:27,203
-[Rod] Ugh!

1949
01:05:27,203 --> 01:05:27,701
Do we know anything

1950
01:05:27,701 --> 01:05:31,021
Do we know anything

1951
01:05:31,023 --> 01:05:31,071
Do we know anything

1952
01:05:31,071 --> 01:05:32,021
-[Chuck] Rod?

1953
01:05:32,023 --> 01:05:34,213
Do we know a boy named Tod?

1954
01:05:34,213 --> 01:05:34,441
Do we know a boy named Tod?

1955
01:05:34,441 --> 01:05:37,811
No.

1956
01:05:37,811 --> 01:05:38,131
I think we better talk

1957
01:05:38,133 --> 01:05:40,133
I think we better talk

1958
01:05:40,133 --> 01:05:41,181
[Marci] (snoring, muttering)

1959
01:05:41,181 --> 01:05:42,021
[Marci] (snoring, muttering)

1960
01:05:42,023 --> 01:05:44,073
Something about

1961
01:05:44,073 --> 01:05:44,551
Something about

1962
01:05:44,551 --> 01:05:46,001
I --

1963
01:05:49,073 --> 01:05:51,292
I --

1964
01:05:51,292 --> 01:05:53,992
(snoring continues)

1965
01:05:53,993 --> 01:05:54,662
(snoring stops)

1966
01:05:54,662 --> 01:05:57,072
(sighs)

1967
01:05:57,073 --> 01:05:58,032
Marci.

1968
01:05:58,032 --> 01:05:58,092
(music playing)

1969
01:05:58,093 --> 01:06:00,073
(music playing)

1970
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:03,083
You mean she's gone?

1971
01:06:03,083 --> 01:06:04,123
[Marci] I had so, like,

1972
01:06:05,163 --> 01:06:06,203
[Marci] I had so, like,

1973
01:06:06,203 --> 01:06:08,142
look for the ring on account

1974
01:06:08,142 --> 01:06:09,122
look for the ring on account

1975
01:06:12,203 --> 01:06:14,163
and I couldn't let her down

1976
01:06:14,163 --> 01:06:14,882
I was hoping that

1977
01:06:14,882 --> 01:06:16,172
I was hoping that

1978
01:06:16,173 --> 01:06:18,252
left to go to the dance, too.

1979
01:06:18,252 --> 01:06:19,082
It's very important.

1980
01:06:19,083 --> 01:06:21,043
It's very important.

1981
01:06:21,043 --> 01:06:21,622
Did you happen to a --

1982
01:06:21,622 --> 01:06:22,212
-[boy] Nope.

1983
01:06:22,213 --> 01:06:23,993
-[boy] Nope.

1984
01:06:23,993 --> 01:06:24,992
It turned out that there was.

1985
01:06:24,992 --> 01:06:25,082
It turned out that there was.

1986
01:06:25,083 --> 01:06:28,003
Man.

1987
01:06:28,003 --> 01:06:28,362
[Doris] Why can't you find

1988
01:06:28,362 --> 01:06:29,202
[Doris] Why can't you find

1989
01:06:29,203 --> 01:06:31,732
In movies, they're big

1990
01:06:31,732 --> 01:06:33,042
In movies, they're big

1991
01:06:33,043 --> 01:06:34,053
They show up

1992
01:06:35,123 --> 01:06:38,472
They show up

1993
01:06:38,472 --> 01:06:39,082
I got the new body.

1994
01:06:39,083 --> 01:06:41,842
I got the great shoes.

1995
01:06:41,842 --> 01:06:43,202
I got the great shoes.

1996
01:06:43,203 --> 01:06:45,212
I got the hair.

1997
01:06:45,212 --> 01:06:46,042
I got the hair.

1998
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:48,033
Same ol' memory.

1999
01:06:48,033 --> 01:06:48,582
What have I done with this ring

2000
01:06:48,582 --> 01:06:50,122
What have I done with this ring

2001
01:06:50,123 --> 01:06:51,952
and why did I buy

2002
01:06:51,952 --> 01:06:52,202
and why did I buy

2003
01:06:52,203 --> 01:06:54,193
I don't care if they're on sale.

2004
01:06:54,193 --> 01:06:55,322
I don't care if they're on sale.

2005
01:06:55,322 --> 01:06:56,202
(music playing)

2006
01:06:56,203 --> 01:06:58,692
(music playing)

2007
01:06:58,692 --> 01:06:59,132
(engine starts)

2008
01:06:59,133 --> 01:07:02,062
-[Herb] Hands up!

2009
01:07:02,062 --> 01:07:04,042
-[Herb] Hands up!

2010
01:07:04,043 --> 01:07:05,432
Oh, look, okay, hands down,

2011
01:07:05,432 --> 01:07:06,192
Oh, look, okay, hands down,

2012
01:07:19,073 --> 01:07:21,983
Was that a gun in his pocket?

2013
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:22,282
(indistinct conversations,

2014
01:07:22,282 --> 01:07:23,072
(indistinct conversations,

2015
01:07:23,073 --> 01:07:25,652
(indistinct conversations,

2016
01:07:25,652 --> 01:07:26,152
I was pretty out of breath

2017
01:07:26,153 --> 01:07:28,043
I figured I had

2018
01:07:28,043 --> 01:07:29,023
I figured I had

2019
01:07:29,023 --> 01:07:32,393
with Spike,

2020
01:07:32,393 --> 01:07:33,013
then figure out someplace

2021
01:07:33,013 --> 01:07:35,133
then figure out someplace

2022
01:07:35,133 --> 01:07:35,763
to store them

2023
01:07:35,763 --> 01:07:37,073
And then get back home

2024
01:07:37,073 --> 01:07:39,043
And then get back home

2025
01:07:39,043 --> 01:07:39,133
It all seemed pretty doable.

2026
01:07:39,133 --> 01:07:40,093
It all seemed pretty doable.

2027
01:07:40,093 --> 01:07:42,043
Until...

2028
01:07:42,043 --> 01:07:42,503
(music playing)

2029
01:07:42,503 --> 01:07:45,043
(music playing)

2030
01:07:45,043 --> 01:07:45,873
Betrayed!

2031
01:07:45,873 --> 01:07:48,043
Betrayed!

2032
01:07:48,043 --> 01:07:49,143
Jennifer had won again.

2033
01:07:49,143 --> 01:07:49,243
Jennifer had won again.

2034
01:07:49,243 --> 01:07:51,123
She had the two coolest guys

2035
01:07:51,123 --> 01:07:52,613
eating right out

2036
01:07:52,613 --> 01:07:53,123
eating right out

2037
01:07:53,123 --> 01:07:55,983
and my best friend

2038
01:07:55,983 --> 01:07:56,093
and my best friend

2039
01:07:56,093 --> 01:07:59,013
This was a wound so deep and --

2040
01:07:59,013 --> 01:07:59,353
This was a wound so deep and --

2041
01:07:59,353 --> 01:08:02,063
This was a wound so deep and --

2042
01:08:02,063 --> 01:08:02,723
I need to --

2043
01:08:02,723 --> 01:08:06,083
...that I...you know...

2044
01:08:09,113 --> 01:08:09,463
...that I...you know...

2045
01:08:09,463 --> 01:08:12,833
Okay, do you remember

2046
01:08:12,833 --> 01:08:13,043
Well -- Well, she --

2047
01:08:13,043 --> 01:08:16,043
Well -- Well, she --

01:08:18,043 --> 01:08:19,073
-(Marci stammering)

2051
01:08:19,073 --> 01:08:19,573
Will you quit it?!

2052
01:08:19,573 --> 01:08:20,213
Will you quit it?!

2053
01:08:20,213 --> 01:08:22,203
Will you quit it?!

2054
01:08:22,203 --> 01:08:22,943
[Rod]

2055
01:08:22,943 --> 01:08:26,183
You remember Tod, right?

2056
01:08:26,183 --> 01:08:26,313
You remember Tod, right?

2057
01:08:26,313 --> 01:08:29,683
I don't know a guy named

2058
01:08:29,683 --> 01:08:30,132
This is what I'm trying

2059
01:08:30,132 --> 01:08:32,092
This is what I'm trying

2060
01:08:32,092 --> 01:08:33,052
I so hope you are

2061
01:08:33,052 --> 01:08:33,992
I so hope you are

2062
01:08:33,993 --> 01:08:36,083
Ugh!

2063
01:08:36,083 --> 01:08:36,422
Marci!

2064
01:08:36,422 --> 01:08:37,152
Jennifer said you were grounded.

2065
01:08:37,153 --> 01:08:39,793
Jennifer said you were grounded.

2066
01:08:39,793 --> 01:08:40,163
Oh? And you were so quick

2067
01:08:40,163 --> 01:08:41,203
Oh? And you were so quick

2068
01:08:41,203 --> 01:08:43,063
You weren't grounded?

2069
01:08:43,063 --> 01:08:43,163
Yes, I was so grounded,

2070
01:08:43,163 --> 01:08:44,212
Yes, I was so grounded,

2071
01:08:44,212 --> 01:08:46,532
I can't even believe you!

2072
01:08:46,533 --> 01:08:47,132
I can't even believe you!

2073
01:08:47,132 --> 01:08:49,102
The point is that Tod --

2074
01:08:49,103 --> 01:08:49,903
-[Marci] The point is --

2075
01:08:49,903 --> 01:08:53,003
-[Marci] The point is --

-[Rod] Tod! Tod!

2077
01:08:53,273 --> 01:08:54,103
and the  only  point is that --

2078
01:08:54,103 --> 01:08:55,163
and the  only  point is that --

2079
01:08:55,163 --> 01:08:56,643
[Ed] Excuse me, son.

2080
01:08:56,643 --> 01:08:57,043
Jennifer...

2081
01:08:57,043 --> 01:08:59,052
Jennifer...

2082
01:08:59,052 --> 01:09:00,012
I need to speak to you

2083
01:09:00,012 --> 01:09:00,192
...my so-called friend --

2084
01:09:00,193 --> 01:09:03,052
...my so-called friend --

2085
01:09:03,052 --> 01:09:03,382
[Ed] Can we go somewhere

2086
01:09:03,382 --> 01:09:04,122
[Ed] Can we go somewhere

2087
01:09:04,123 --> 01:09:06,153
(exhales sharply)

2088
01:09:06,153 --> 01:09:06,753
The point is, is that while you

2089
01:09:06,753 --> 01:09:08,083
The point is, is that while you

2090
01:09:08,083 --> 01:09:10,123
The point is, is that while you

2091
01:09:10,123 --> 01:09:11,172
Doris was in desperate

2092
01:09:11,172 --> 01:09:13,202
Desperate, okay?

2093
01:09:13,203 --> 01:09:13,493
Desperate, okay?

2094
01:09:13,494 --> 01:09:16,864
And I, and only I, and I alone,

2095
01:09:16,864 --> 01:09:17,033
And I, and only I, and I alone,

2096
01:09:17,033 --> 01:09:19,132
Summer, was the only

2097
01:09:19,132 --> 01:09:20,232

2098
01:09:20,234 --> 01:09:21,123
in a time of crisis

2099
01:09:21,123 --> 01:09:23,603
How bad do you feel now?

2100
01:09:23,604 --> 01:09:24,083
How bad do you feel now?

2101
01:09:24,083 --> 01:09:26,193
Doris is in trouble?

2102
01:09:26,193 --> 01:09:26,973
Doris is in trouble?

2103
01:09:26,974 --> 01:09:28,183
Don't try and change

2104
01:09:28,183 --> 01:09:30,343

01:09:30,344 --> 01:09:31,164

2108
01:09:34,113 --> 01:09:37,023
Oh, darn, high heels.

2109
01:09:39,203 --> 01:09:40,453
Oh, darn, high heels.

2110
01:09:40,453 --> 01:09:43,823
How does anybody walk

2111
01:09:43,824 --> 01:09:43,983
Ouch.

2112
01:09:43,983 --> 01:09:46,063
Ouch.

2113
01:09:46,063 --> 01:09:47,193
(metal creaking)

2114
01:09:47,194 --> 01:09:48,153
(metal creaking)

2115
01:09:48,153 --> 01:09:50,063
Oh.

2116
01:09:50,063 --> 01:09:50,563
Oh, boy.

2117
01:09:50,564 --> 01:09:51,154
Oh, boy.

2118
01:09:59,172 --> 01:10:00,672
-[Doris] You must

2119
01:10:00,674 --> 01:10:02,084
Okay, back away from the knight.

2120
01:10:08,183 --> 01:10:10,083
And no funny business.

2121
01:10:10,083 --> 01:10:10,783
And no funny business.

2122
01:10:10,784 --> 01:10:11,213
You got me?

2123
01:10:11,213 --> 01:10:14,013
Mm-hmm.

2124
01:10:22,053 --> 01:10:24,103
You know what this is,

2125
01:10:26,203 --> 01:10:27,633
You know what this is,

2126
01:10:27,634 --> 01:10:28,124
Well, um...

2127
01:10:31,123 --> 01:10:32,133
Well, um...

2128
01:10:32,133 --> 01:10:34,213
a-actually I do.

2129
01:10:34,213 --> 01:10:34,373
Oh, yeah?

2130
01:10:34,374 --> 01:10:37,064
Oh, yeah?

2131
01:10:39,143 --> 01:10:41,113
It's a -- It's a --

2132
01:10:41,114 --> 01:10:41,143
It's a -- It's a --

2133
01:10:41,143 --> 01:10:44,023
Oh.

2134
01:10:44,023 --> 01:10:44,483
Don't make me use it, I will.

2135
01:10:44,484 --> 01:10:45,163
Don't make me use it, I will.

2136
01:10:45,163 --> 01:10:47,853
Oh, Herb.

2137
01:10:47,854 --> 01:10:49,083
This isn't like you.

2138
01:10:49,083 --> 01:10:50,173
This isn't like you.

2139
01:10:50,173 --> 01:10:51,223
(metal squeaks)

2140
01:10:51,225 --> 01:10:53,073
(metal squeaks)

2141
01:10:53,073 --> 01:10:54,163
How come you know so much

2142
01:10:54,163 --> 01:10:54,593
How come you know so much

2143
01:10:54,595 --> 01:10:56,213
And -- and the thing

2144
01:10:56,213 --> 01:10:57,963
even Doris didn't know

2145
01:10:57,965 --> 01:11:00,003
even Doris didn't know

2146
01:11:00,003 --> 01:11:01,333
Oh, yes, she did.

2147
01:11:01,335 --> 01:11:02,043
She did, Herb, because she knew

2148
01:11:02,043 --> 01:11:04,053
She did, Herb, because she knew

2149
01:11:04,053 --> 01:11:04,703

2150
01:11:04,705 --> 01:11:06,083

Alright, uh, inside.

Alright, uh, inside.

2155
01:11:11,445 --> 01:11:13,105
Hello?

Oh, hi, Donna.

No, she didn't come over here.

01:11:38,063 --> 01:11:38,403
No, she didn't come over here.

2161
01:11:38,405 --> 01:11:39,123
It's always bad news

2162
01:11:39,123 --> 01:11:41,043
what they think is going on.

2163
01:11:43,023 --> 01:11:44,023

I hope so.

2295
01:14:48,504 --> 01:14:50,544
Because if this ever hits

2314
01:15:20,424 --> 01:15:20,874
Well, is it any less farfetched

01:15:20,878 --> 01:15:21,524
that some actress would come

2316
01:15:21,524 --> 01:15:23,494

Hey, Marci!

01:23:33,454 --> 01:23:34,544
[Ed] Herb, you've always

And now you suddenly have

2652

01:23:38,434 --> 01:23:39,464
that two people were behind

2654
01:23:39,464 --> 01:23:39,644
that two people were behind

2655
01:23:39,669 --> 01:23:41,659
You expect the voters

2656
01:23:41,660 --> 01:23:43,039
You expect the voters

2657
01:23:43,039 --> 01:23:44,529
[Henderson] Well, nobody

2658
01:23:44,530 --> 01:23:46,409
'til this thing is solved.

2659
01:23:46,409 --> 01:23:47,649
That means mostly for you two.

2660
01:23:47,650 --> 01:23:49,779
That means mostly for you two.

2661
01:23:49,779 --> 01:23:50,529
[Doris] Herb.

2662

(indistinct conversation)

2663
01:23:51,570 --> 01:23:52,650
(indistinct conversation)

2664
01:23:52,650 --> 01:23:53,149
Did you really mean that, Herb?

2665
01:23:53,149 --> 01:23:54,549
That I'm the most important

2666
01:23:54,550 --> 01:23:55,560
That I'm the most important

2667
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:56,519
[Henderson] ...that Herb has

2668
01:23:56,519 --> 01:23:57,469
[Henderson] ...that Herb has

01:23:59,550 --> 01:23:59,889
Herb, don't take

2671
01:23:59,889 --> 01:24:02,569

2672
01:24:02,570 --> 01:24:03,259
to say something, please.

2673
01:24:03,259 --> 01:24:05,659
[Ed] The most important thing,

2674
01:24:05,660 --> 01:24:06,629
[Ed] The most important thing,

2675
01:24:06,629 --> 01:24:09,609
is that we're missing

2676
01:24:09,610 --> 01:24:09,999
Now, you say all this happened

2677
01:24:09,999 --> 01:24:12,489
Now, you say all this happened

Where is it?

2680
01:24:13,630 --> 01:24:16,630
[Doris] I -- I don't have it.

2681
01:24:16,630 --> 01:24:16,739
I didn't know

2682
01:24:16,739 --> 01:24:19,469
I didn't know

2683
01:24:19,470 --> 01:24:20,109
even if she had the ring back.

2684
01:24:20,109 --> 01:24:21,489
As far as I could tell,

2685
01:24:21,490 --> 01:24:22,570
As far as I could tell,

2686
01:24:22,570 --> 01:24:23,480
no matter

2687
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:24,550

2690
01:24:26,850 --> 01:24:27,550
Doris, don't give me

2691
01:24:27,550 --> 01:24:29,560

2693
01:24:30,220 --> 01:24:31,510
short-term memory loss jazz.

2694
01:24:31,510 --> 01:24:33,450
I wish everyone

01:24:35,490 --> 01:24:36,960
I don't remember.

2698

2700
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:40,330
Anything since last November.

2701
01:24:40,330 --> 01:24:42,600
Anything since last November.

2702
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:43,630
Oops.

[Ed] Oh, yeah, now I remember.

Except, what are we doing here?

2708
01:24:49,530 --> 01:24:50,440
Except, what are we doing here?

2709
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:53,530

(magic warbling)

2717
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:03,920
I could -- I could stay.

2718
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:06,470

2719
01:25:06,470 --> 01:25:07,290

(opera music playing)

2722
01:25:08,650 --> 01:25:10,650
I was, like, so proud of myself

2723
01:25:10,650 --> 01:25:10,660
I was, like, so proud of myself

2724
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:14,030

2725
01:25:14,030 --> 01:25:14,510
with the perfect solution

2726
01:25:14,510 --> 01:25:16,580
Mom had forgot all about

2727
01:25:16,580 --> 01:25:17,400
Mom had forgot all about

2728
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:19,430
and Summer getting licked,

2729
01:25:19,430 --> 01:25:20,770

2731
01:25:21,530 --> 01:25:24,140
Mom, Mom,

01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:24,510
Mom, Mom,

01:25:24,510 --> 01:25:26,620
We're going now?

2734

01:25:27,510 --> 01:25:29,430
No.

Yeah, Ma?

2740
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:36,630
This morning when you asked

2741
01:25:36,630 --> 01:25:37,620
if you could have

2742
01:25:37,620 --> 01:25:40,620
if you could have

2743
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:40,990
what did we say?

2744
01:25:40,990 --> 01:25:42,450
what did we say?

2745
01:25:42,450 --> 01:25:43,630
Yes or no?

2746
01:25:43,630 --> 01:25:44,360
(music playing)

2747
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:47,590
Well, Mom, as I recall

2748
01:25:47,590 --> 01:25:47,730
Well, Mom, as I recall

2749
01:25:47,730 --> 01:25:49,480
Of course Summer had forgotten

2750
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:50,590
Of course Summer had forgotten

2751
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:53,530
just like everybody else,

2752
01:25:53,530 --> 01:25:54,470
just like everybody else,

2753
01:25:54,470 --> 01:25:57,630
and it took me most of the next

2754
01:25:57,630 --> 01:25:57,840
and it took me most of the next

2755
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:00,530
She wanted her own

2756
01:26:00,530 --> 01:26:01,210
[Marci] Lost it?!

2757
01:26:01,210 --> 01:26:02,440
[Marci] Lost it?!

2758
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:04,580
[both]

2759
01:26:04,581 --> 01:26:05,550
Girls, shh.

2760
01:26:05,550 --> 01:26:07,610
Girls, shh.

2761
01:26:10,530 --> 01:26:11,320
It's not lost,

2762
01:26:11,321 --> 01:26:12,500
It's not lost,

2763
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:14,520
I found a ring in the back room.

2764
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:14,690
I found a ring in the back room.

2765
01:26:14,691 --> 01:26:16,610
It isn't worth much.

2766
01:26:16,610 --> 01:26:18,060
It isn't worth much.

2767
01:26:18,061 --> 01:26:20,560
I put it some place

2768
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:21,430
I can't remember where.

2769
01:26:21,431 --> 01:26:23,510
I can't remember where.

2770
01:26:23,510 --> 01:26:24,800
You know, I forgot where I put

2771
01:26:24,801 --> 01:26:25,530
You know, I forgot where I put

2772
01:26:25,530 --> 01:26:27,440
Well, we're all getting older.

2773
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:28,170
Well, we're all getting older.

2774
01:26:28,171 --> 01:26:29,490
Oh, Doris, please, please try

2775
01:26:29,490 --> 01:26:31,540

01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:34,910
It'll turn up.

2778
01:26:34,911 --> 01:26:37,480

Hello, Hidden Treasures.

Oh, dinner?

Oh, dinner?

2788
01:26:55,530 --> 01:26:57,520
That would be lovely.

2789
01:26:57,520 --> 01:26:58,500
The end.

01:26:58,501 --> 01:27:00,430
[Summer]

2791
01:27:00,430 --> 01:27:01,870
I so can't believe it.

2792
01:27:01,871 --> 01:27:02,560
What did she give you?

2793
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:04,430
Ah, a D-plus.

2794
01:27:05,490 --> 01:27:06,610
Ah, a D-plus.

2795
01:27:06,610 --> 01:27:08,610
She obviously doesn't like me.

2796
01:27:08,610 --> 01:27:08,611
She obviously doesn't like me.

2797
01:27:08,611 --> 01:27:10,540
What?

2798
01:27:10,540 --> 01:27:11,550
Let me see.

2799
01:27:11,550 --> 01:27:11,980
Let me see.

2800
01:27:11,981 --> 01:27:14,530
Well, she said the assignment

2801
01:27:14,530 --> 01:27:15,350
Well, she said the assignment

2802
01:27:15,351 --> 01:27:16,490
But it was true,

2803
01:27:16,490 --> 01:27:18,480
But it was true,

2804
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:18,720
You have your own phone,

01:27:18,721 --> 01:27:19,590
You have your own phone,

said you couldn't have,

2808
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:25,460
And you have the rats

2809
01:27:25,461 --> 01:27:27,590
And you have the rats

2810
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:28,830
Plus, you wrote six pages when

2811
01:27:28,831 --> 01:27:29,630
Plus, you wrote six pages when

2812
01:27:29,630 --> 01:27:32,200
And everybody knows

2813
01:27:32,201 --> 01:27:33,460
And everybody knows

2814
01:27:33,460 --> 01:27:35,570

2815
01:27:35,571 --> 01:27:37,500
I, like, also lost 20 points

2816
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:38,940
I, like, also lost 20 points

2817
01:27:38,941 --> 01:27:40,610
And then she goes,

2818
01:27:40,610 --> 01:27:42,310
And then she goes,

2819
01:27:42,311 --> 01:27:42,630
why Rod could remember

2820
01:27:42,630 --> 01:27:45,550
why Rod could remember

2821
01:27:45,550 --> 01:27:45,680
and that I could remember

2822
01:27:45,682 --> 01:27:48,540
And then I was all like,

2823
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:49,050
And then I was all like,

2824
01:27:49,052 --> 01:27:50,590

2825
01:27:50,590 --> 01:27:52,420
Some things can't be explained."

2826
01:27:52,422 --> 01:27:52,650
That's why I put the part

2827
01:27:52,650 --> 01:27:54,570
That's why I put the part

2828
01:27:54,570 --> 01:27:55,790

2830
01:27:59,162 --> 01:27:59,450
I know that's your great

2831
01:27:59,450 --> 01:28:01,500
I know that's your great

2832
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:02,530
That's life.

2833
01:28:02,532 --> 01:28:05,902
What can you do?

2834
01:28:05,902 --> 01:28:06,510
What can you do?

2835
01:28:06,510 --> 01:28:08,450
You are so right.

2836
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:09,270
And that's what I told her.

2837
01:28:09,272 --> 01:28:10,580
So much of life is a mystery.

2838
01:28:10,580 --> 01:28:11,630
So much of life is a mystery.

2839
01:28:11,630 --> 01:28:12,640
And nobody's there

2840
01:28:12,642 --> 01:28:13,520
And nobody's there

2841
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:14,520
Why do I gotta start

2842
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:15,600
What did she say?

2843
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:16,010
What did she say?

2844
01:28:16,012 --> 01:28:17,630
Started going on

2845
01:28:17,630 --> 01:28:19,380
Started going on

2846
01:28:19,382 --> 01:28:20,450
What attitude?

2847
01:28:20,450 --> 01:28:22,490
Ugh! Exactly.

2848
01:28:22,490 --> 01:28:22,750
Ugh! Exactly.

2849
01:28:22,752 --> 01:28:23,660
But then, she says if I rewrite

2850
01:28:23,660 --> 01:28:26,120
But then, she says if I rewrite

2851
01:28:26,122 --> 01:28:26,620
I can turn my D plus into a C.

2852
01:28:26,620 --> 01:28:27,650
I can turn my D plus into a C.

2853
01:28:27,650 --> 01:28:29,490
And that's exactly

2854
01:28:29,492 --> 01:28:30,590
Watch this.

2855
01:28:30,590 --> 01:28:32,860
