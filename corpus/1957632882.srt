Thank you.

175
00:11:05,674 --> 00:11:08,410
What... what are y'all doing
here? How did you get here?

176
00:11:08,444 --> 00:11:11,647
Oh, it's a...
It's kind of a long story,

177
00:11:11,681 --> 00:11:16,051
but we just couldn't stay away.

178
00:11:16,085 --> 00:11:19,154
We wanted to let you know
how much we support you.

179
00:11:19,188 --> 00:11:21,623
- I love you two so much.
- You, we too.

180
00:11:21,657 --> 00:11:23,325
Thank you.
It means the world to me.

181
00:11:26,428 --> 00:11:29,331
I'm sure we'll find a way
to get him out soon.

182
00:11:29,365 --> 00:11:30,499
We will.

183
00:11:30,532 --> 00:11:32,067
It was nice to see him.

184
00:11:32,101 --> 00:11:34,636
- It was.
- [both laugh]

185
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,871
- All right.
- Where y'all headed?

186
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:39,541
Oh, um, our grandmother lives
about five miles from here.

187
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:42,478
So we're gonna go visit her and see if
she knows anything about our daddy's case.

188
00:11:42,511 --> 00:11:44,413
Well, you have my number
if you need anything.

189
00:11:44,446 --> 00:11:48,584
I do, and as soon as my phone's
charged, I'll text you.

190
00:11:48,617 --> 00:11:51,987
Thank you, for all your help.
We really appreciate it.

191
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,923
- Yeah.
- It wasn't any trouble at all.

[mellow music playing]

193
00:12:07,002 --> 00:12:09,037
[Erin]
Where have you two been?

194
00:12:09,071 --> 00:12:11,073
Your mama's been worried sick.

195
00:12:12,074 --> 00:12:14,610
- [both] Hi, grandma.
- [Brooke chuckles]

196
00:12:14,643 --> 00:12:16,178
Some rig you got here.

197
00:12:16,211 --> 00:12:18,213
- It was Hailey's idea.
- Yeah.

198
00:12:18,247 --> 00:12:20,315
We texted mom before
our phones died.

199
00:12:20,349 --> 00:12:23,352
Texted her?
You should have called her.

200
00:12:23,385 --> 00:12:27,122
[scoffs] Swear, I'm witnessing
the death of communication.

201
00:12:27,156 --> 00:12:29,158
We just came from seeing daddy.

202
00:12:29,191 --> 00:12:31,527
[Brooke] They said it'll cost
$50,000 to get him out of jail.

203
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,262
I know.

204
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:36,298
Do you have that much money,
grandma?

205
00:12:36,331 --> 00:12:40,169
Well, darlin', I don't
but we'll figure something out.

206
00:12:40,202 --> 00:12:41,637
[car engine revving]

207
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,372
Here comes your mama.

208
00:12:45,274 --> 00:12:49,111
I don't imagine she's going
to be too happy with you two.

209
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:52,014
- [Hailey] Three, oh!
- [Erin] Oh!

210
00:12:58,253 --> 00:13:00,389
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, Mom.

211
00:13:00,422 --> 00:13:04,126
You cannot just ride cross-country
whenever you feel like it.

212
00:13:04,727 --> 00:13:09,064
Look, we're sorry,
but we got to see dad.

213
00:13:09,097 --> 00:13:10,265
Hey, Candace!

214
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:13,502
Hm.
Erin. Can you believe your son?

215
00:13:13,535 --> 00:13:17,005
Last time I heard you're
innocent until proven guilty.

216
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:20,008
[scoffs] Well,
I don't have the money to bail him out

217
00:13:20,042 --> 00:13:22,010
and you haven't worked in years.

218
00:13:22,044 --> 00:13:23,746
I'm literally going to have
to pick up extra shifts

219
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:27,382
just to make ends meet
while Dean's incarcerated.

220
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,718
[Erin]
Well, I could help you out.

221
00:13:28,751 --> 00:13:30,385
Why don't you just leave
the girls with me?

222
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:34,256
I'll look after 'em and its
summer, so there's no school?

223
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:37,159
- Can we, Mom?
- We can text you every day.

224
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,497
I should be punishing you,
not rewarding you.

225
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:44,801
Does that mean, yes?

226
00:13:44,834 --> 00:13:45,702
Fine.

227
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,638
But you better behave
yourselves.

228
00:13:49,671 --> 00:13:52,508
Erin, if they get into any trouble
you better call me immediately.

229
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:56,211
Oh, well, I'm sure they're gonna
be perfect little angels.

230
00:13:56,245 --> 00:13:58,347
- [chuckling]
- [Candace] Get over here.

231
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,015
I'm worried sick about you.

232
00:14:02,184 --> 00:14:04,353
Don't ever do that again.

233
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:05,454
All right.

234
00:14:05,487 --> 00:14:09,324
[mellow music playing]

235
00:14:09,358 --> 00:14:10,793
Why do we have to go here?

236
00:14:10,827 --> 00:14:12,695
I volunteer here
a few days a week.

237
00:14:12,729 --> 00:14:16,131
Volunteer? Didn't you used
to be a country music star?

238
00:14:16,164 --> 00:14:18,534
Yep, and now,
I'm a star volunteer.

239

- Come on.

241
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:26,375
We're gonna be right with you.

242
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:30,612

- Thank you.

- Good morning, Erin.
- Hello, Miss Mays.

245
00:14:34,717 --> 00:14:36,151
My daughters are one
of your biggest fans.

246
00:14:36,184 --> 00:14:38,420
- Can I get a selfie?
- Oh, why, sure.

247
00:14:38,453 --> 00:14:40,522
- Thank you so much. [laughing]
- Okay.

It's so good to see
you, Miss Mays.

We really appreciate you
helping us out today.

Oh, it's my pleasure.

- Well, hot chicken tenders, yeah. Yep.

- Homemade mashed potatoes.

256

How's your son? Is he good?

Is he doing well? Good.

263
00:15:13,756 --> 00:15:16,224
And you young, man,
would you like some chicken?

- All right. All right.

developing my career in music management.

I just heard you sing
and I think you have talent.

Yeah.

be good, too.

00:39:14,196 --> 00:39:16,999
Oh, you don't say.

685
00:39:17,033 --> 00:39:21,070
Remember all those times
just sitting around singing?

686
00:39:21,103 --> 00:39:22,637
I knew you were
something special.

687
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:27,243
You're both so special.

688
00:39:27,276 --> 00:39:29,178
You don't have to say that, Dad.

689
00:39:29,211 --> 00:39:31,881
I mean it.
So proud of all my girls.

690
00:39:33,716 --> 00:39:34,717
All of you.

691
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:39,855
You just hang in there because we're going to
do everything we can to get you out of here.

692
00:39:39,889 --> 00:39:41,824
Thanks, Mom.

693
00:39:41,857 --> 00:39:44,193
In the meantime,
don't worry about me.

694
00:39:44,226 --> 00:39:45,227
I'm okay.

695
00:39:47,363 --> 00:39:51,333
[mellow music playing]

696
00:39:51,367 --> 00:39:52,634
What are we going to do?

697
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:56,172
I wish they'd pay us that
insurance money from the accident.

698
00:39:56,205 --> 00:39:58,707
Well, what's the holdup?
It's been four years.

699
00:39:58,741 --> 00:40:01,710
I know. Typical red tape.

700
00:40:01,744 --> 00:40:03,913
Just need to shake things up.

701
00:40:05,247 --> 00:40:08,350
Well, hello, Miss Mays, girls.

702
00:40:08,384 --> 00:40:10,019
- Mr. Daniels.
- Hi.

703
00:40:10,052 --> 00:40:13,222
It's a beautiful day, isn't it?

704
00:40:13,255 --> 00:40:15,057
I suppose so.

705
00:40:15,091 --> 00:40:17,893
Well, I know you're all busy.
Nice seeing you.

706
00:40:17,927 --> 00:40:20,229
Actually,
it's lucky we ran into you.

707
00:40:20,262 --> 00:40:24,733
We are having dinner at our house
tonight and we wanted to invite you.

708
00:40:24,767 --> 00:40:28,070
- Really?
- Yes.

709
00:40:28,104 --> 00:40:30,739
Well, that sounds lovely.

710
00:40:30,773 --> 00:40:33,342
Shall we say seven o'clock?

711
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:34,910
Sounds perfect.

712
00:40:34,944 --> 00:40:37,079
Lovely. See you then.

713
00:40:37,113 --> 00:40:38,814
212 Lincoln Lane.

714
00:40:38,848 --> 00:40:40,916
I look forward
to seeing you later.

715
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:41,750
Erin.

716
00:40:45,387 --> 00:40:49,091
Yeah, see you later, I guess.

717
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:51,293
What in the world
are you thinking?

718
00:40:51,327 --> 00:40:53,295
Grandma, you said
we need to shake things up.

719
00:40:53,329 --> 00:40:55,731
[chuckling]

720
00:41:06,142 --> 00:41:08,110
- All right.
- Okay, what do you think?

721
00:41:08,144 --> 00:41:10,746
Uh, maybe no scarf.

722
00:41:10,779 --> 00:41:12,982
[doorbell dings]

723
00:41:13,015 --> 00:41:15,017
Oh, he's early.

724
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:16,085
Go answer the door.

725
00:41:16,118 --> 00:41:17,720
You look great, Grandma.

726
00:41:17,753 --> 00:41:21,223
- Thanks.
- [Brooke chuckles]

727
00:41:21,257 --> 00:41:24,793
- Ah, young love.
- [both laughing]

728
00:41:27,997 --> 00:41:29,932
[clears throat]

729
00:41:29,965 --> 00:41:32,001
Hello, Miss Mays.

730
00:41:32,034 --> 00:41:35,004
Mr. Daniels. Please come in.

731
00:41:35,037 --> 00:41:35,804
Thank you.

732
00:41:38,507 --> 00:41:39,875
Nice.

733
00:41:39,909 --> 00:41:41,744
- We're right in here.
- Nice.

734
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,183
- It's right in here.
- Oh!

735
00:41:47,216 --> 00:41:49,151
Aren't you eating with us?

736
00:41:49,185 --> 00:41:53,122
Uh, we changed our minds.
Hi, Mr. Daniels.

737
00:41:53,155 --> 00:41:54,123
- Hi.
- [Brooke] Hi, Mr. Daniels.

738
00:41:54,156 --> 00:41:55,824
Hello.

739
00:41:55,858 --> 00:41:58,994
You know
how flighty teenagers are.

740
00:41:59,028 --> 00:42:01,430
We're gonna go hang out
on our phones instead.

741
00:42:01,463 --> 00:42:02,464
Yeah.

742
00:42:03,432 --> 00:42:06,368
Uh... Oh, would you like
to sit over here?

743
00:42:06,402 --> 00:42:08,504
May I help you?

744
00:42:08,537 --> 00:42:09,905
- Thank you.
- Sure.

745
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,875
Yeah, yeah.

746
00:42:16,278 --> 00:42:18,113
They're very sweet girls.

747
00:42:18,147 --> 00:42:20,482
Someone went through a lot
of trouble.

748
00:42:20,516 --> 00:42:21,717
They are sweet.

749
00:42:22,885 --> 00:42:24,486
- Ah. Ahem.
- [crickets chirping]

750
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:30,426
- Would you like some wine?
- Oh, please. Yes.

751
00:42:30,459 --> 00:42:32,161
- [both laughing]
- Allow me.

752
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:49,311
To... tomorrow.

753
00:42:50,913 --> 00:42:52,414
I'll drink to that.

754
00:42:54,483 --> 00:42:57,219
[rock music playing on mobile]

755
00:42:57,253 --> 00:42:58,320
[laughing]

756
00:43:01,523 --> 00:43:04,360
- Hailey, Brooke, turn that off.
- Oh, no, please.

757
00:43:04,393 --> 00:43:06,395
Leave it on. I love that song.

758
00:43:06,428 --> 00:43:08,430
- You do?
- Yes.

759
00:43:08,464 --> 00:43:11,867
I've always loved your music.

760
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:16,238
You know when I was 20, I could sing
every song in your <i>Silver Ridge</i> album.

761
00:43:16,272 --> 00:43:21,477
You were always the embodiment of...
[stammers] ...a classy, strong, good woman.

762
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:27,049
I really shouldn't say you
were, you still are today.

763
00:43:27,082 --> 00:43:28,017
Thank you.

764
00:43:29,985 --> 00:43:31,553
You can leave that on.

765
00:43:31,587 --> 00:43:35,190
[both laughing]

766
00:43:35,224 --> 00:43:37,293
I haven't heard her laugh
like that in a long time.

767
00:43:39,061 --> 00:43:39,995
Yeah, me neither.

768
00:43:46,435 --> 00:43:48,404
- Thank you.
- Hey, Bill.

769
00:43:48,437 --> 00:43:49,505
Hey.

770
00:43:53,309 --> 00:43:55,911
- Good morning.
- Hey, there.

771
00:43:55,944 --> 00:43:57,146
What will you have?

772
00:43:58,947 --> 00:44:02,117
Hey, I really enjoyed
y'alls concert the other night.

773
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:05,487
That was crazy, wasn't it?

774
00:44:06,488 --> 00:44:08,457
I was wondering. Uh...

775
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:11,860
I play guitar and I thought maybe we
could get together and jam sometime.

776
00:44:15,064 --> 00:44:19,034
I don't jam and I don't date which
sounds like that's where this is heading.

777
00:44:20,602 --> 00:44:22,971
Why not, if you don't
mind me asking?

778
00:44:23,005 --> 00:44:24,440
Well, because of my condition.

779
00:44:26,542 --> 00:44:28,911
No stress, remember?

780
00:44:28,944 --> 00:44:31,647
And dating can be
very stressful.

781
00:44:31,681 --> 00:44:35,250
Okay, well,
I just thought it'd be fun.

782
00:44:35,284 --> 00:44:37,386
Take a look at that menu.
I'll be back in a minute.

783
00:44:40,122 --> 00:44:42,024
[mellow music playing]

784
00:44:48,163 --> 00:44:50,132
You wanted orange juice, right?

785
00:44:50,165 --> 00:44:53,635
What you two girls did last
night was embarrassing

786
00:44:53,669 --> 00:44:57,339
and awkward, and ill conceived.

787
00:44:57,373 --> 00:45:00,376
And I'm gonna have
to give both of you...

788
00:45:00,409 --> 00:45:02,544
a high-five.

789
00:45:02,578 --> 00:45:05,514
[all laughing]

790
00:45:05,547 --> 00:45:08,217
Oh, he is a nice man.

791
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:11,520
I have to say
I really enjoyed myself.

792
00:45:11,553 --> 00:45:15,190
And I've been thinking.
I've decided

793
00:45:15,224 --> 00:45:19,027
that I'm going to come out
of retirement, just temporarily,

794
00:45:19,061 --> 00:45:23,031
and we're gonna raise money
for Dean's bail with a concert.

795
00:45:23,065 --> 00:45:26,034
I mean that is the one
thing I can do.

796
00:45:26,068 --> 00:45:27,436
- Right?
- I love that.

797
00:45:27,469 --> 00:45:29,638
- Yes.
- [all laugh]

798
00:45:29,671 --> 00:45:32,241
- Look, I feel better already.
- Yeah.

799
00:45:38,547 --> 00:45:40,516
All right.

800
00:45:40,549 --> 00:45:44,019
Well, let's talk about
what we're going to do.

801
00:45:44,052 --> 00:45:49,124
Actually, Sir, we're real excited
about cutting a record with you...

802
00:45:49,158 --> 00:45:51,994
but how would you feel about also
doing something with my grandma?

803
00:45:53,763 --> 00:45:59,067
[laughs]
And just who is your grandma?

804
00:45:59,101 --> 00:46:01,303
The amazing Erin Mays.

805
00:46:03,505 --> 00:46:05,374
Erin Mays is your grandmother?

806
00:46:08,277 --> 00:46:09,645
And she's coming out
of retirement?

807
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:12,314
- [door opens]
- Yeah. Here she is now.

808
00:46:15,484 --> 00:46:16,452
Bob.

809
00:46:18,721 --> 00:46:21,190
Good to see you.

810
00:46:21,223 --> 00:46:23,659
[Brooke]
So you already know each other?

811
00:46:23,693 --> 00:46:29,231
Bob was my first manager and if
my memory serves me correctly,

812
00:46:29,264 --> 00:46:33,736
you still owe me $50 in
royalties from my first album.

813
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:36,572
[laughs]
Your check's in the mail.

814
00:46:36,605 --> 00:46:40,175
[all laughing]

815
00:46:40,209 --> 00:46:44,213
So, Erin,
you're planning on unretiring?

816
00:46:45,214 --> 00:46:47,282
Just for one performance.

817
00:46:47,316 --> 00:46:51,053
I'd like to perform
with my granddaughter Hailey.

818
00:46:51,086 --> 00:46:53,723
I want to raise some funds
for my son's defense.

819
00:46:53,756 --> 00:46:56,492
And I thought you could help
us with the concert.

820
00:46:56,525 --> 00:47:01,296
And then, you could release a
single of the live performance.

821
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:03,632
How does that sound?

822
00:47:03,665 --> 00:47:06,602
Sounds really good.

823
00:47:06,635 --> 00:47:08,203
I'm in. [chuckles]

824
00:47:08,237 --> 00:47:12,574
Oh, there's just one
little problem.

825
00:47:12,608 --> 00:47:14,777
You got to give me my 50 bucks.

826
00:47:14,811 --> 00:47:17,112
[all laugh]

827
00:47:17,145 --> 00:47:19,081
Come on.

828
00:47:19,114 --> 00:47:20,082
All right.

829
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:24,286
- Oh, there you go.
- He hates this, you know?

830
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:25,654
[Bob chuckles]

831
00:47:25,688 --> 00:47:27,757
[clears throat]

832
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:29,258
What?

833
00:47:29,291 --> 00:47:32,127
I'm checking to see
if it's counterfeit.

834
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,229
[Bob laughing]

835
00:47:36,665 --> 00:47:40,335
Once I was paralyzed, I wanted to figure
out how to do everything by myself.

836
00:47:40,369 --> 00:47:42,705
Saddle, jump on, everything.

837
00:47:42,739 --> 00:47:46,174
- How long ago was your accident?
- Four years.

838
00:47:46,208 --> 00:47:49,511
- And you haven't ridden since?
- No, Ma'am.

839
00:47:49,545 --> 00:47:51,714
It's probably time
for you to get back on.

840
00:47:51,748 --> 00:47:56,485
[mellow music playing]

841
00:47:59,789 --> 00:48:01,557
- Now it's your turn.
- [chuckles]

842
00:48:03,392 --> 00:48:05,695
Don't be afraid to use
him for balance.

843
00:48:05,728 --> 00:48:07,864
[Marcos] Here you go.
Let me get your leg.

844
00:48:07,897 --> 00:48:08,698
You're going to help her leg?

845
00:48:08,731 --> 00:48:09,999
I'm just going to grab you,
okay?

846
00:48:10,033 --> 00:48:11,801
- Hold that side and then you pull yourself.
- One, two, three.

847
00:48:13,535 --> 00:48:16,371
- [Amberly] How's that feel?
- Weird.

848
00:48:16,405 --> 00:48:17,740
Get comfortable.

849
00:48:17,774 --> 00:48:20,576
Everything we do now is with our
body, our hands, and our voice.

850
00:48:21,878 --> 00:48:23,378
Okay.

851
00:48:23,412 --> 00:48:24,413
You're ready?

852
00:48:24,681 --> 00:48:26,548
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

853
00:48:32,722 --> 00:48:34,089
There she is.

854
00:48:34,857 --> 00:48:36,224
There she is.

855
00:48:38,427 --> 00:48:40,262
Well, I haven't played
in a while, so...

856
00:48:41,263 --> 00:48:43,800
All right.
[laughs]

857
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:45,868
Do you remember that song we

since the accident.

1198
01:11:56,826 --> 01:11:58,227
The accident was my fault.

1199
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:02,131
Oh, no. It's okay.

1200
01:12:02,164 --> 01:12:05,835
Your grandpa loved both
of you girls so much.

1201
01:12:07,003 --> 01:12:11,874
And, you know,
sometimes things just happen

1202
01:12:11,907 --> 01:12:15,577
and there's just no
rhyme or reason.

1203
01:12:15,610 --> 01:12:17,680
You know, you could
twist yourself all up

1204
01:12:17,713 --> 01:12:19,647
trying to figure out why...

1205
01:12:21,784 --> 01:12:23,085
and there ain't no why.

1206
01:12:25,587 --> 01:12:29,759
But we just got
to keep going, right?

1207
01:12:29,792 --> 01:12:34,030
And we got to remember
all of those who are with us.

1208
01:12:35,698 --> 01:12:37,967
And the last thing grandpa
would have wanted

1209
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:42,537
was for us to be sad
or feel guilty.

1210
01:12:44,206 --> 01:12:47,910
He'd want us to live
our lives to the fullest.

1211
01:12:48,911 --> 01:12:49,677
Right?

1212
01:12:52,048 --> 01:12:58,020
So you sing
and you barrel race...

1213
01:13:00,022 --> 01:13:01,656
and fall in love...

1214
01:13:04,393 --> 01:13:06,262
and make your grandpa proud...

1215
01:13:08,197 --> 01:13:10,199
[sobbing]

1216
01:13:10,232 --> 01:13:14,303
...because he is watching
over all of us.

1217
01:13:14,336 --> 01:13:15,137
Okay?

1218
01:13:25,014 --> 01:13:29,318
Hey, Maddie, just checking in.

1219
01:13:29,351 --> 01:13:31,854
Call me back
when you get a chance.

1220
01:13:31,887 --> 01:13:33,055
All right, bye.

1221
01:13:34,757 --> 01:13:36,292
I wonder where she is?

1222
01:13:36,325 --> 01:13:38,194
- I don't know.
- [mobile chimes]

1223
01:13:41,864 --> 01:13:44,066
Can you believe Rufus
just turned 18 today?

1224
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:47,136
- He said he was 19.
- I thought he was 12.

1225
01:13:47,169 --> 01:13:49,205
[birds chirping]

1226
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:53,809
Which means he was 17 last week.

1227
01:13:53,843 --> 01:13:55,010
[door opens]

1228
01:13:56,011 --> 01:13:59,181
Grandma, can you give
us a ride somewhere?

1229
01:13:59,215 --> 01:14:01,383
Mr. Daniels is just pulling up.
Come on, we'll take you.

1230
01:14:01,417 --> 01:14:02,617
[car approaches]

1231
01:14:03,886 --> 01:14:06,021
Mr. Daniels,
can we give the girls a ride?

1232
01:14:06,055 --> 01:14:07,389
Sure, ladies. Come on.

1233
01:14:08,891 --> 01:14:11,260
Yeah, yeah. Listen, I need you to
meet us at that horse betting place.

1234
01:14:11,293 --> 01:14:13,863
Can you be there in ten minutes?
Rufus.

1235
01:14:13,896 --> 01:14:15,865
Rufus, just come, okay?

1236
01:14:15,898 --> 01:14:17,199
Okay, see you there.

1237
01:14:23,339 --> 01:14:26,008
Hailey, I'm telling you,
there's no way to get the money back.

1238
01:14:26,041 --> 01:14:29,211
- Will you at least help me try?
- [people cheering on TV]

1239
01:14:29,245 --> 01:14:30,980
Now, I'll do whatever I can.

1240
01:14:32,114 --> 01:14:34,250
Okay, who did you place
your bets with?

1241
01:14:34,283 --> 01:14:36,719
The guy at the end there,
George.

1242
01:14:38,287 --> 01:14:39,788
[Hailey] All right. Let's go.

1243
01:14:43,792 --> 01:14:46,095
Um, hi, George.

1244
01:14:46,128 --> 01:14:48,998
- You know Rufus, right?
- Hi, George.

1245
01:14:49,031 --> 01:14:50,766
Yeah. Hey, Rufus.

1246
01:14:50,799 --> 01:14:53,869
Are you sure you want
to try this again? [chuckles]

1247
01:14:53,903 --> 01:14:58,374
Well, you see, George,
the $50,000 that Rufus lost last week

1248
01:14:58,407 --> 01:15:00,843
also belonged to me,
so we're here to get it back.

1249
01:15:00,876 --> 01:15:03,312
Yeah, well,
that ain't gonna happen.

1250
01:15:03,345 --> 01:15:05,481
All bets are final.

1251
01:15:05,514 --> 01:15:07,683
It ain't my problem
he lost your money, lady.

1252
01:15:08,951 --> 01:15:11,387
Well, you see,
it actually is your problem

1253
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:15,424
because Rufus was a minor when you took
all those bets from him and that's illegal.

1254
01:15:15,457 --> 01:15:17,159
Whoa... hey!

1255
01:15:17,193 --> 01:15:19,495
- I didn't know he's a minor.
- Yes, you did.

1256
01:15:19,528 --> 01:15:22,164
You were charging 20 percent for
the risk that you were taking.

1257
01:15:22,198 --> 01:15:25,201
Okay, look. So even if I did,
and I ain't saying I did...

1258
01:15:26,302 --> 01:15:28,337
you got no proof
he was ever even here.

1259
01:15:28,370 --> 01:15:30,472
I don't know. I mean, come on.

1260
01:15:30,506 --> 01:15:34,443
With the face like this, I don't think
people around here could forget it.

1261
01:15:34,476 --> 01:15:35,711
Thanks.

1262
01:15:35,744 --> 01:15:40,182
And taking a $50,000 bet from
a minor sounds pretty bad to me.

1263
01:15:40,216 --> 01:15:42,184
It was actually a $40,000 bet.

1264
01:15:42,218 --> 01:15:44,386
He took the 10,000
for himself off top.

1265
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:46,355
Well, it's getting
worse and worse.

1266
01:15:46,388 --> 01:15:50,192
Oh, actually, it's a criminal
offense with a pretty stiff penalty.

1267
01:15:50,226 --> 01:15:51,460
You know, all right,
all right, all right.

1268
01:15:51,493 --> 01:15:53,796
I'll give you
the lousy ten grand.

1269
01:15:53,829 --> 01:15:55,931
You can bet
on any horse you like.

1270
01:15:55,965 --> 01:15:57,433
The last race is in ten minutes,

1271
01:15:57,466 --> 01:15:59,835
so you ain't got a whole lot
of time, Sister.

1272
01:16:02,371 --> 01:16:03,906
Okay. We'll do it.

1273
01:16:05,908 --> 01:16:08,410
Hailey, are you sure you want
to let Rufus bet that money?

1274
01:16:08,444 --> 01:16:10,913
He doesn't have a very
good track record.

1275
01:16:10,946 --> 01:16:14,183
- No pun intended.
- What else can we do?

1276
01:16:14,216 --> 01:16:16,185
$10,000 isn't gonna help dad.

1277
01:16:18,053 --> 01:16:22,057
- Just have to pray.
- Okay.

1278
01:16:22,091 --> 01:16:24,893
Looks like there's a lot of
praying going on around here.

1279
01:16:24,927 --> 01:16:28,063
- [alarm blares]
- [indistinct announcement]

1280
01:16:28,097 --> 01:16:29,098
What about For The Win?

1281
01:16:30,199 --> 01:16:33,135
No, no, no, no, no.
For The Win is only two to one.

1282
01:16:33,168 --> 01:16:34,503
There are three horses
that are five to one,

1283
01:16:34,536 --> 01:16:36,405
your best bet is going
to be Silent Speed.

1284
01:16:36,438 --> 01:16:39,508
The best time
last three races, good jockey.

1285
01:16:39,541 --> 01:16:42,911
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure, Hailey.

1286
01:16:42,945 --> 01:16:44,013
I can feel it in my bones.

1287
01:16:45,848 --> 01:16:49,084
Normally, I would not condone
betting on a horse race.

1288
01:16:50,085 --> 01:16:51,954
But these are not normal times.

1289
01:16:54,957 --> 01:16:55,958
Let's do it.

1290
01:16:57,593 --> 01:16:59,261
[announcer] <i>And they're off. This is
the tenth and last race of the day.</i>

1291
01:16:59,295 --> 01:17:00,162
Come on, Silent Speed.

1292
01:17:02,464 --> 01:17:06,435
- <i>Yeah, come on, Silent speed.</i>
- [Hailey] Go, Silent Speed.

1293
01:17:06,468 --> 01:17:07,469
Come on, come on!

1294
01:17:09,938 --> 01:17:13,575
Get the lightening out,
Silent Speed. Come on!

1295
01:17:13,609 --> 01:17:14,810
Come on, come on.

1296
01:17:14,843 --> 01:17:16,545
[announcer] <i>...and Peter Piper
second and third.</i>

1297
01:17:16,578 --> 01:17:19,481
- <i>For The Win making his move on the inside.</i>
- Come on. Come on.

1298
01:17:19,515 --> 01:17:22,851
[announcer] <i>Silent Speed faltering and
For The Win takes the lead by a nose.</i>

1299
01:17:22,885 --> 01:17:25,254
- <i>Silent Speed tries to make a move on the outside...</i>
- [Brook] Come on, Silent Speed.

1300
01:17:25,287 --> 01:17:27,589
[announcer] <i>...but Peter Piper
maintains lead for third.</i>

1301
01:17:27,623 --> 01:17:29,058
<i>At the finish,</i>

1302
01:17:29,091 --> 01:17:32,861
<i>it's For The Win at first place
followed by Silent Speed in second</i>

1303
01:17:32,895 --> 01:17:34,863
<i>and Peter Piper shows for third.</i>

1304
01:17:36,532 --> 01:17:38,100
Hailey, I'm so sorry.

1305
01:17:39,335 --> 01:17:40,502
I'm so sorry.

1306
01:17:47,009 --> 01:17:48,177
I know. We'll figure it out.

1307
01:17:52,348 --> 01:17:55,384
[announcer] <i>Ladies and gentlemen,
an update from today's final race.</i>

1308
01:17:55,417 --> 01:17:58,187
<i>For The Win
has been disqualified</i>

1309
01:17:58,220 --> 01:18:01,156
<i>and Silent Speed
moves up to first.</i>

1310
01:18:01,190 --> 01:18:02,391
<i>Peter Piper goes into second...</i>

1311
01:18:02,424 --> 01:18:04,893
- No way!
- Are you kidding me?

1312
01:18:04,927 --> 01:18:07,663
- Yes! Yeah!
- [all cheering]

1313
01:18:07,697 --> 01:18:10,132
- Yes!
- We did it.

1314
01:18:11,033 --> 01:18:12,034
We got them!

1315
01:18:13,135 --> 01:18:14,536
[laughing] That's amazing.

1316
01:18:15,170 --> 01:18:17,373
[Erin] Oh, my goodness!
Can y'all believe that?

1317
01:18:17,406 --> 01:18:19,908
- Oh, I almost had a heart attack.
- [Hailey laughing]

1318
01:18:19,942 --> 01:18:21,677
You really love money,
don't you?

1319
01:18:21,711 --> 01:18:24,146
- What's not to like about 50K?
- All right.

1320
01:18:24,179 --> 01:18:28,350
Um... Okay. Hey, Maddie, uh,

1321
01:18:28,384 --> 01:18:30,185
just trying to get
a hold of you again.

1322
01:18:30,219 --> 01:18:31,320
Got some really great news,

1323
01:18:31,353 --> 01:18:34,056
so I don't know, call me back
when you get a chance.

1324
01:18:34,691 --> 01:18:36,191
All right. Bye.

1325
01:18:36,225 --> 01:18:38,560
[ambulance siren wailing]

1326
01:18:49,438 --> 01:18:51,640
We need to follow that ambulance.
Grandma! Mr. Daniels!

1327
01:19:00,048 --> 01:19:01,083
[Hailey] What happened?

1328
01:19:01,116 --> 01:19:03,185
We found her unresponsive
on her kitchen floor.

1329
01:19:10,993 --> 01:19:12,494
Are any of you related
to Maddie?

1330
01:19:12,528 --> 01:19:14,563
Uh, we're her close friends.

1331
01:19:14,596 --> 01:19:16,432
I don't think
she has any family.

1332
01:19:16,465 --> 01:19:17,466
How is she?

1333
01:19:18,701 --> 01:19:22,237
She's stable, but her lupus
is more serious than we thought.

1334
01:19:22,271 --> 01:19:25,674
I feel we need to move on to the
next step which is immunotherapy.

1335
01:19:25,708 --> 01:19:27,209
Uh, when can you start that?

1336
01:19:27,242 --> 01:19:29,611
Well, the treatment
is very expensive

1337
01:19:29,645 --> 01:19:31,681
and she doesn't have
health insurance.

1338
01:19:31,714 --> 01:19:33,382
So we can't do it at this time.

1339
01:19:34,383 --> 01:19:39,455
Um, what will happen to her
if you can't do the treatment?

1340
01:19:41,490 --> 01:19:43,992
Her condition
will worsen over time

1341
01:19:44,026 --> 01:19:46,195
and her episodes
will become more severe.

1342
01:19:49,164 --> 01:19:51,233
I wish I had better
news for you.

1343
01:19:51,266 --> 01:19:52,434
One of you can go see her now.

1344
01:19:54,069 --> 01:19:55,738
- Go ahead, honey.
- Okay.

1345
01:20:00,375 --> 01:20:02,110
[indistinct chatter]

1346
01:20:02,144 --> 01:20:03,312
- Hey.
- Hey.

1347
01:20:06,482 --> 01:20:07,483
Hey.

1348
01:20:09,418 --> 01:20:12,187
I have a flair
for the dramatic, don't I?

1349
01:20:12,221 --> 01:20:14,089
Some people will do
anything for attention.

1350
01:20:14,122 --> 01:20:15,390
[both chuckling]

1351
01:20:15,424 --> 01:20:18,126
- That's me, drama queen.
- Mm-hmm.

1352
01:20:20,162 --> 01:20:21,731
How do you feel?

1353
01:20:21,764 --> 01:20:22,765
Okay.

1354
01:20:24,299 --> 01:20:27,770
Doctor says I need some
expensive new drug,

1355
01:20:27,804 --> 01:20:29,338
but I told her...

1356
01:20:31,206 --> 01:20:32,641
I'm a waitress, so...

1357
01:20:34,476 --> 01:20:36,478
You're gonna be okay, Maddie.

1358
01:20:36,512 --> 01:20:38,380
That's nice of you
to say that...

1359
01:20:39,749 --> 01:20:42,117
but I've been dealing
with this my whole life and...

1360
01:20:43,418 --> 01:20:45,587
it was bound to catch up
with me one of these days.

1361
01:20:50,727 --> 01:20:52,427
I don't want you to lose hope.

1362
01:20:53,662 --> 01:20:55,531
Okay, Maddie.

1363
01:20:55,564 --> 01:20:57,633
It looks like I need
to get some blood.

1364
01:20:57,666 --> 01:20:59,268
Yippie.

1365
01:20:59,301 --> 01:21:02,604
And this is where I exit.
Extreme needle phobia.

1366
01:21:02,638 --> 01:21:04,339
- Lightweight.
- Um...

1367
01:21:04,373 --> 01:21:06,508
We'll all be in the waiting
room if you need us.

1368
01:21:06,542 --> 01:21:07,543
Okay.

1369

1370

Thank you all so much
for being here.

1372
01:21:15,818 --> 01:21:17,185
Of course, we'd be here.

1373
01:21:39,742 --> 01:21:41,510
Are y'all thinking
what I'm thinking?

1374
01:21:42,745 --> 01:21:44,814
I think we are.

1375
01:21:44,847 --> 01:21:46,849
Do you mean use this
money for Maddie?

1376
01:21:53,522 --> 01:21:55,324
What about daddy?

1377
01:21:55,357 --> 01:21:57,593
Oh, honey, he'll understand.

1378
01:21:57,626 --> 01:21:59,528
And he'll be all right.

1379
01:21:59,561 --> 01:22:04,132
And I'll just unretire again
and we'll raise some more money.

1380
01:22:04,166 --> 01:22:07,837
Y'all, that's too much
to ask of you.

1381
01:22:07,870 --> 01:22:09,772
It's the right thing
to do, Collin.

1382
01:22:11,173 --> 01:22:13,710
That money right there was
meant for Maddie's treatment.

1383
01:22:15,577 --> 01:22:18,915
You know, Erin, uh, everyone,
I didn't want to overstep,

1384
01:22:18,948 --> 01:22:23,185
but, um, before I retired
in my early career,

1385
01:22:23,218 --> 01:22:25,621
I was a pretty
successful attorney.

1386
01:22:26,823 --> 01:22:29,424
- You were?
- Among other things.

1387
01:22:29,458 --> 01:22:34,764
So I'd be happy to unretire
and take your son's case.

1388
01:22:34,797 --> 01:22:36,465
Pro bono, of course.

1389
01:22:37,599 --> 01:22:40,535
- What's pro bono?
- Means for free.

1390
01:22:40,569 --> 01:22:44,606
Ah. Wow! Thank you.

1391
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:47,910
- Yeah, thank you, Mr. Daniels.
- You're welcome.

1392
01:22:47,944 --> 01:22:49,344
And in order to better
serve your son,

1393
01:22:49,378 --> 01:22:53,482
first thing I'd do is weigh the jury
and, uh, request a bench trial.

1394
01:22:55,250 --> 01:22:57,920
- Well, you sound like you know what you're talking about.
- [chuckles]

1395
01:23:00,589 --> 01:23:02,491
We gratefully accept.

1396
01:23:03,325 --> 01:23:04,326
It would be my pleasure.

1397
01:23:09,799 --> 01:23:11,466
It looks like
you got some visitors.

1398
01:23:12,467 --> 01:23:13,635
Thank you.

1399
01:23:13,669 --> 01:23:16,571
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

1400
01:23:16,605 --> 01:23:18,407
- Thank you. - Thank you.
- Yeah. Of course.

1401
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:23,445
Um, Maddie, we have something
important to tell you.

1402
01:23:23,478 --> 01:23:26,916
We just want you to know
that we have all agreed on this.

1403
01:23:26,949 --> 01:23:27,950
Even Rufus.

1404
01:23:29,052 --> 01:23:31,486
We've decided to use the money
from the fundraiser

1405
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,188
to help pay
for your treatment.

1406
01:23:34,423 --> 01:23:37,794
No, you guys.

1407
01:23:37,827 --> 01:23:39,696
- It's what we're gonna do.
- Yeah.

1408
01:23:39,729 --> 01:23:43,766
Oh, thank you so much.
Oh, my gosh!

1409
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:46,268
- Of course.
- Thank you.

1410
01:23:46,301 --> 01:23:47,536
Yeah. You're gonna be okay.

1411
01:23:49,304 --> 01:23:52,474
When you agreed to drive
the truck for Mr. Robins,

1412
01:23:52,507 --> 01:23:54,977
did you know the truck
was full of TVs?

1413
01:23:55,011 --> 01:23:56,445
Yes, Sir. I did.

1414
01:23:56,478 --> 01:23:59,448
And, uh, did you know these
TVs were stolen?

1415
01:23:59,481 --> 01:24:02,785
No, Sir. I thought I was doing
a favor for a friend.

1416
01:24:02,819 --> 01:24:06,689
Even though you knew this friend
had a history of criminal activity?

1417
01:24:06,723 --> 01:24:10,727
Yes, Sir. I...
I believe people can change.

1418
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:12,527
He assured me that he had.

1419
01:24:12,561 --> 01:24:15,464
Well, exactly how long have you
and Mr. Robins been friends?

1420
01:24:15,497 --> 01:24:18,801
My whole life. Uh, we went
to grammar school together.

1421
01:24:18,835 --> 01:24:22,337
He got me my first real job.
He was a good friend to me.

1422
01:24:22,370 --> 01:24:27,744
I would ask the defense Exhibit 1 be
entered into the record for evidence.

1423
01:24:27,777 --> 01:24:32,982
It's a copy of an email from Mr. Mays to
Mr. Bill Robins from one month before.

1424
01:24:33,015 --> 01:24:35,317
I need Mr. Mays
to read a portion of it.

1425
01:24:37,419 --> 01:24:40,388
- Response?
- No objections.

1426
01:24:40,422 --> 01:24:41,423
Admitted.

1427
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:47,562
Mr. Mays, would you please
read the last two lines?

1428
01:24:47,596 --> 01:24:51,366
"I know times have been rough
for you the past few years, Bill,

1429
01:24:51,399 --> 01:24:54,036
"but I want you to know
that I'm here for you

1430
01:24:54,070 --> 01:24:57,740
"and if there's anything I can
help you with, you can call me.

1431
01:24:57,774 --> 01:24:59,208
"You've always been
a good friend of me..."

1432
01:24:59,242 --> 01:25:03,545
Your Honor, Mr. Mays is a hard-working
citizen with no prior records.

1433
01:25:03,578 --> 01:25:05,580
I do see a breaking
and entering.

1434
01:25:05,614 --> 01:25:09,584
Oh, that was when he was a minor
and it was taken off his record.

1435
01:25:09,618 --> 01:25:10,853
Yes, I see that.

1436
01:25:10,887 --> 01:25:14,023
He's had the same job for ten
years with the same employer.

1437
01:25:14,056 --> 01:25:16,826
He's also a family man
with two lovely daughters,

1438
01:25:16,859 --> 01:25:20,963
but the prosecution has sucked
Mr. Mays into this case

1439
01:25:20,997 --> 01:25:25,001
as a smokescreen to take
the spotlight off Mr. Robins,

1440
01:25:25,034 --> 01:25:26,568
who is the true guilty party.

1441
01:25:27,804 --> 01:25:30,039
I, therefore,
respectfully request

1442
01:25:30,072 --> 01:25:33,075
that the court declare a mistrial
in its case against Mr. Mays

1443
01:25:33,109 --> 01:25:35,477
and that he be
immediately released.

1444
01:25:37,379 --> 01:25:39,949
That should be fine.
I'll talk to you later.

1445
01:25:39,982 --> 01:25:41,416
- [Rufus] Hey, Hailey.
- Hey.

1446
01:25:42,417 --> 01:25:45,021
Fingers crossed
for a good verdict.

1447
01:25:45,054 --> 01:25:48,590
I'm sorry. That sounded stupid
because you know what I mean.

1448
01:25:48,623 --> 01:25:49,658
I know what you mean.

1449
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:54,396
Hey, you didn't bet
on my dad's trial, did you?

1450
01:25:54,429 --> 01:25:57,566
No, no. Of course not. I...

1451
01:25:57,599 --> 01:26:00,870
I'm actually trying not
to do that anymore.

1452
01:26:00,903 --> 01:26:02,637
I've been going
to these meetings

1453
01:26:02,671 --> 01:26:05,640
and I'm hoping to put
my gambling days behind me.

1454
01:26:05,674 --> 01:26:07,009
That sounds really good, Rufus.

1455
01:26:09,644 --> 01:26:11,113
- I'll see you inside.
- Sure.

1456
01:26:12,882 --> 01:26:14,851
- [Marcos] Hey.
- Hey.

1457
01:26:16,185 --> 01:26:18,821
Thank you for coming.
You didn't have to.

1458
01:26:18,855 --> 01:26:20,857
Well, of course. Yeah, I had to.

1459
01:26:22,591 --> 01:26:23,693
[sighs]

1460
01:26:25,527 --> 01:26:28,164
Listen, Marcos, I was pretty
hard on you the other day.

1461
01:26:28,197 --> 01:26:29,832
Hailey, there's... there's
no need to apologize.

1462
01:26:29,866 --> 01:26:31,466
I should have stopped Rufus,

1463
01:26:31,499 --> 01:26:33,468
but, instead,
I went along with him.

1464
01:26:35,670 --> 01:26:39,909
- I feel terrible.
- No, don't feel terrible.

1465
01:26:39,942 --> 01:26:40,810
I forgive you.

1466
01:26:43,578 --> 01:26:47,549
And, hey, uh, once this is all
over, I thought we could hang out...

1467
01:26:47,582 --> 01:26:51,187
...but just as friends.

1468
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:53,956
Yeah, I'd like that.

1469
01:26:53,990 --> 01:26:57,693
- Me too.
- [clock chimes]

1470
01:26:57,727 --> 01:26:59,996
All right.
It's time for the verdict.

1471
01:27:02,865 --> 01:27:06,568
[judge] I've taken both of your
arguments under careful consideration.

1472
01:27:06,601 --> 01:27:10,139
It's hard to completely
exonerate Mr. Mays,

1473
01:27:10,172 --> 01:27:12,440
but the State
has the burden of proof

1474
01:27:12,474 --> 01:27:15,077
which it has not met
in this case.

1475
01:27:15,111 --> 01:27:20,783
Therefore, I find Mr. Mays not guilty of
transporting contraband across state lines.

1476
01:27:20,816 --> 01:27:23,551
[all cheering]

1477
01:27:25,888 --> 01:27:29,658
But I do find you guilty of not
using your common sense.

1478
01:27:29,692 --> 01:27:34,063
Mr. Mays, the next time an
ex-con asks you to drive a truck

1479
01:27:34,096 --> 01:27:37,733
full of valuable cargo
across the state line,

1480
01:27:37,767 --> 01:27:40,069
I hope you think twice.

1481
01:27:40,102 --> 01:27:41,404
I will, Your Honor.

1482
01:27:42,637 --> 01:27:45,875
In the meantime, you won't
be able to drive for six months

1483
01:27:45,908 --> 01:27:48,044
because I'm suspending
your license

1484
01:27:48,077 --> 01:27:54,183
and I'm fining you $548 for the
original probable cause of speeding.

1485
01:27:55,184 --> 01:27:59,587
You're free to go, Mr. Mays.
