1
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,080
One- two-

2
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,480
One, two, three, four...

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,400
( theme music playing )

4
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,920
- You've got to face it -

5
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,240
- Love makes no sense -

6
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,800
- Don't try to fight it -

7
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,840
- All your defenses
are useless to you now -

8
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,080
- When you leave this room -

9
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,920
- All you will
think about is me -

10
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,120
- I'll be every song on your radio,
everything on your TV -

11
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,040
- Just wait and see -

12
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,840
- Even though you
never looked at me -

13
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,320
- I know the real you -

14
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,760
- Is behind those eyes -

15
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,200
- Every true story -

16
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,320
- Is full of lies -

17
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,280
- We tell -

18
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,800
( phone ringing )

19
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,080
Recording: Hi, this is Eli,
leave a message.

20
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,280
( beep )

21
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,400
Hey, it's Tom...

22
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,040
once again. Call me.

23
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,800
- I'll take you by the hand -

24
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,880
- And soon
I'll cool your fire -

25
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,640
- Out of your body -

26
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,280
- There is no way -

27
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,840
- You can stand me -

28
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,040
- I know the real you... -

29
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,960
( car alarm blaring )

30
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,040
- Is full of lies -

31
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,360
- That keep still -

32
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,400
- The real you -

33
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:19,800
- The real you -

34
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:27,520
- The real you -

35
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,320
- The real you -

36
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,280
- The real... -

37
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,760
- You. -

38
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,400
Hi. I'm Eli Wyckoff.
I'm here for my test results.

39
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,760
You're about an hour early.

40
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,840
Why don't you get yourself
some coffee?

41
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,520
I'm going to wait,
if that's okay.

42
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,520
Okay.

43
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,040
Is this your first time?

44
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,560
My first?

45
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,520
No, no.

46
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,880
I have this habit of getting
tested after every boy-

47
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,960
guy that I ever...

48
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,320
There's only been three
in the past few...

49
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,520
This is the third, so it's not
really a habit.

50
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,040
- Yet.
- Uh-huh.

51
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,600
Oh, no. It's not even a chance
that I have- you know?

52
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,920
I know the dangers.

53
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,080
I do the police blotter
for the Hollywood News,

54
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,040
so, me and danger
are like this.

55
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,400
So why are you here?

56
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,320
( phone ringing )

57
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,760
Feedback Clinic,
this is Esther.

58
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,760
Uh-huh.

59
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
Did you suck his dick?

60
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,240
Then you better come in.

61
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,680
Okay.

62
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,280
Hi, I'm Tom,
and I'm an alcoholic.

63
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,440
Group: Hi, Tom.

64
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm 1 0 days away
from my thirty-day chip.

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,960
Anyway...

66
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,400
both my parents
are drunks.

67
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,760
I still don't feel like
I belong here.

68
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,520
I go to flea markets.

69
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,240
I vote.

70
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,160
Even for, like, school board

71
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,000
and Prop whatever.

72
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,240
I teach special ed,
for Christ's sake.

73
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,760
I'm not like
a Hollywood has-been

74
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,720
crouched in an airport bathroom
sucking on a can of Final Net.

75
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,720
So, why am I here?

76
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,040
The truth?

77
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,600
The truth is I met a guy.

78
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,480
And if I had
to pick... a trigger,

79
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,800
I'd say it was
all over this guy.

80
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,880
But, whatever,
who cares how it happened?

81
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,440
Bottom line is I'm here.

82
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,520
I quit drinking
and guys because

83
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,120
I can't be trusted
with either.

84
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,920
Thanks.

85
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,200
Nice going.

86
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,760
I'll get it right
one of these times.

87
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,240
Sounded right to me.

88
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,640
It was like you were telling
my story.

89
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,680
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

90
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,520
I shared first,
I get the book's rights.

91
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,480
That's fair.

92
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,480
Tell me about the guy.

93
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,160
I don't want
to keep you from-

94
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,200
What?
From what?

95
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,680
The important things in life
like stapling or filing?

96
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,320
Oh, please!
I couldn't be more bored.

97
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,600
This thing with that guy,
you seem okay with it.

98
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,480
Only to the sight-
and-hearing impaired.

99
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,240
Pull up your chair, honey.

100
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,360
- This one?
- Yeah.

101
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,640
So, you and your boyfriend,
you broke up.

102
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,880
Not a boyfriend,
I don't know.

103
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,880
I don't know.

104
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,800
I don't know, but things
just got too... "too."

105
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,080
I choked, I'm an alcoholic.

106
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,720
You do the math.

107
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,840
We met on a blind date
which sucked.

108
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,200
We became friends,

109
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,120
and now we don't speak
to each other.

110
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,440
So it's a happy ending.

111
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,920
How did we meet?

112
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,360
It started with a phone call
from my best friend, Jackie.

113
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,480
( answer machine beeping )

114
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,240
John? Pick up.

115
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,160
Pick up, pick up, pick up...

116
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,680
Damn it!
Where are you?

117
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,160
I'm at a pay phone

118
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,120
because I can't get my shitty
cell phone to work

119
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,680
unless I stand on my head
with my fingers up my ass.

120
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,640
( honking )

121
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,560
Fuck you!

122
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,520
Anyway...

123
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,840
what are you doing
Friday night?

124
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,120
Cause I met this guy, Bret,

125
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,560
at a furniture store
on Montana,

126
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,560
and he showed me this great
loveseat to die for.

127
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,080
I think I can get it wholesale.

128
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,520
There's just one catch...

129
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,360
( music playing )

130
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,280
- Everything I want
You got it -

131
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,760
- Everything I need
You own it -

132
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,320
- Everything I need
You got it -

133
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,720
- Everything in me
You own it -

134
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,280
- Everything I want
You got it -

135
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,640
- Everything I need
You own it -

136
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,320
- Everything I need
You got it -

137
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,480
- Everything in me
You own it. -

138
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,640
Any luck?

139
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,600
Oh! With...?

140
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,320
I thought you were
looking for change

141
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,320
under the cushions.

142
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,040
Oh, God!

143
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,000
You saw me?

144
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,200
Yeah, the whole routine.

145
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,240
Great. Now
I'm thoroughly mortified.

146
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,800
You're fine,
don't worry about it.

147
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,320
I know. Now it's your turn
to do something humiliating.

148
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,880
I work in a furniture store.
Those bases are covered.

149
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,320
What's humiliating about
an employee discount?

150
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,320
Does that apply to
this wheely-carty thing?

151
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,800
'Cause this is yummy.

152
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,040
A, I get 1 0% off of this crap.

153
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,760
And, B, I don't know
if the whole

154
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,520
Clockwork Orange cum Ikea
thing is really your scene.

155
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,280
Quite a salesman.

156
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,040
I don't know
what half this shit is.

157
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,040
Okay, great!

158
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,200
You know, my heart does
beat fast for this loveseat.

159
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,520
You're kidding?

160
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,520
Why?
Do you hate it?

161
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,480
No. It's the only thing
in the store that's mine.

162
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,560
Yours?

163
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,680
One of my designs.

164
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,640
Oh, you're a designer?

165
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,560
Yeah. This is one of
my first projects.

166
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,000
I love it.

167
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,960
Thank you.

168
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,160
What is the color?
Sort of a yellow-beige-yellow?

169
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,120
Buttercup.

170
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,240
Buttercup?

171
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,480
Buttercup.

172
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,200
I'm not gay, just because
I said buttercup.

173
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,920
I have this argument
with Eli all the time.

174
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,120
Just because I say "buttercup,"
doesn't mean I'm gay,

175
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,040
or used to be gay,
or want to be gay.

176
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,360
I'm not gay,
just very particular about

177
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,400
the nomenclature I use
regarding my palette.

178
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,720
Who's Eli?
The boyfriend?

179
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,800
Right.

180
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,320
No, he's my best friend...

181
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,120
who happens to be gay.

182
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,480
- You know what I think?
- What?

183
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,680
I think you're one of those guys
who flirts with a girl,

184
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,160
maybe even takes her to dinner,
but when push comes to shove,

185
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,560
the only frenching you'll be
doing with her are her braids.

186
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,400
Wow! That's pretty sassy!

187
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,200
So you've been
braided a lot lately?

188
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,160
No!
I know gay men,

189
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,920
- I practically invented them.
- Okay.

190
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,640
There's no such thing
as a straight guy

191
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,200
with a gay best friend
he's not fucking.

192
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,560
Don't give me that look.

193
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,920
My friend, Tom, who is single,
if you're interested,

194
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,480
he's the first to agree.

195
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,440
Right. Okay.

196
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,720
Thanks for the tip, but I'm not
particularly interested in Tom.

197
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,280
Unless, of course,
he has your eyes.

198
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,120
So, there's actually a chance
that he didn't hate my guts

199
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,920
and I could be having
his children on that

200
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,760
kick-ass buttercup loveseat.
Which is where you come in.

201
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,760
It was, like, great!

202
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,880
Next she'll ask me to blow
some guy from "3 Day Blinds."

203
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,640
In the movies, when a guy's
in the supermarket

204
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,280
and he accidentally bumps
shopping carts

205
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,960
- with the love of his life?
- Uh-huh.

206
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,920
The last few times
I've bumped carts with anyone

207
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,480
they looked to be
fresh off the special bus.

208
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,640
That is why I let my friends
fix me up.

209
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,560
( phone ringing )

210
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,560
Machine: Hi, this is Eli.
Leave a message.

211
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,080
- ( beep )
- Eli, are you there? Buddy?

212
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,560
That's right. There's
an X-Files marathon on.

213
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,480
I cannot believe I'm friends
with a trekkie, it's pathetic.

214
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,480
I am not a trekkie!
You got that?

215
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,480
I just like the X-Files.

216
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,440
I believe the truth
is out there, don't you?

217
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,800
Whatever,
I fully hooked you up.

218
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,520
You have a date
on Friday night.

219
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,360
Wait a minute!
What?

220
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,760
That's right. Your losing streak
is over, my man.

221
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,080
He's a tall stud,
a big guy.

222
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,280
Okay, you always say that.
It's like entry-level.

223
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,560
It means he's got nipples.

224
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,760
Maybe that'd be a step up.

225
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,760
Ha ha, that's funny.

226
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,800
His friend, Jackie, came
into the store,

227
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,120
I completely hit it off.

228
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,640
Yikes! Let me tell you,
she's got unbelievable KB.

229
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,080
What is that, killer butt?

230
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,160
No, killer boobs.

231
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,320
She told me about
her friend, Tom,

232
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,760
sounds like a nice guy.

233
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,600
I lied and said you were
a great guy. I told her about you.

234
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,560
That's real nice.

235
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,040
Now you two have
to go out Friday.

236
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,120
Wait a minute! Says who?

237
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,840
Can I call you back?

238
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,080
I'm at my loser
gay friend's place.

239
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,440
Funny.

240
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,120
It didn't go so well
last time with... Richard, was it?

241
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,040
Rita, from UPS!
She was a woman!

242
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,280
Whatever!
She's still gay!

243
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,080
That's your problem,
you're so picky.

244
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,080
You, yourself, said
she had KB.

245
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,160
Killer boobs?

246
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,560
No, butt.

247
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,440
The whole initial thing
has got to stop.

248
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,560
And, PS, I never said KB,
I said KGB.

249
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,640
Killer garlic breath.

250
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,320
Bottom line, I made
a reservation for you, for Tom,

251
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,680
Friday night, Annette's, 8:00,
be there, be square.

252
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,920
I hate it when people say that

253
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,920
'cause even when I'm there,
I'm square, so where's the incentive?

254
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,640
He's a teacher, sounds like
a great guy.

255
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,600
Maybe you'll get lucky,
have to stay after class.

256
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,240
Detention?
You'd like that.

257
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,840
- That's really funny.
- Discipline, gravity boots...

258
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,160
Of course, you went.

259
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,120
Yup, I went.

260
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,920
( upbeat music playing )

261
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,120
- She landed on my roof, -

262
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,080
- Mad love from Venus -

263
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,040
- Her ship ran out of gas, -

264
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,840
- Fast as lightning,
love came between us -

265
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,240
- Fashion girl
from outer space, -

266
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,880
- Chorus: I'll never do you wrong. -

267
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,920
- Future love! -

268
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,280
- That's right, that's right,
that's right -

269
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,160
- Making future love tonight -

270
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,320
- That's right, that's right,
that's right -

271
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,320
- Making future love tonight -

272
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,600
- It's all right if I love you -

273
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,320
- It's all right if I don't -

274
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,040
- I'm not afraid
that you're running away -

275
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,360
- 'Cause I got the feeling
honey that you won't -

276
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,840
- Super sonic safety valve, -

277
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,120
- Chorus: I'll never do you wrong -

278
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,120
- That's right, that's right,
making future love tonight -

279
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,600
- That's right, that's right. -

280
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,320
Eli: I didn't have
high hopes for this date.

281
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,360
Receptionist: You didn't have
anything to lose.

282
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,000
Eli: I know. Honestly,
all I kept thinking was,

283
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,320
"I hope he doesn't smoke."

284
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,120
I'm going to get another drink.
Do you want something?

285
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,880
Yes, I'd like another
seltzer with lime.

286
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,880
- Seltzer with lime.
- Make it a wine spritzer.

287
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,040
Spritzer. Got it.

288
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,680
On second thought,
can I get a Seven and Seven?

289
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,640
Rocks with a twist.

290
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,640
Are you sure?

291
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,680
Yeah, I always get
a Seven and Seven.

292
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,280
Hi, we're going to have-

293
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,720
Absolut martini up, two olives,
make it a little dirty.

294
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,480
You?

295
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,760
Do you like movies?

296
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,440
Yeah, I like movies.

297
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,400
Yeah, me too.

298
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,320
I think it was gay night
on cable last night.

299
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,600
"In and Out" was on again.

300
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,480
Uh-huh.

301
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,040
I thought it was great to see
a movie like that with two guys.

302
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:25,920
Not with two guys... two guys who...
you know, in the movie-

303
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,880
I hated it.

304
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,840
Oh, yeah, me too.

305
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,320
I thought it was light, fun.

306
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,280
- Fun?
- Yeah.

307
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,640
Fun to see Kevin Kline get on
his sorry-ass middle-aged knees

308
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,600
and give us a big old
Hollywood blowjob by catering to

309
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,720
every clichéed homophobic
stereotypical idea of

310
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,960
what it means to be gay?

311
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,960
Without having the decency
or the courtesy,

312
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,280
or even just the balls
to drop a little trou

313
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,040
and show us his.

314
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,000
Wait a minute, come on!

315
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,320
I thought it was nice to see
a guy coming out to his family,

316
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,680
his friends, not to mention
his fiancée.

317
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,440
His fiancée? This loser bitch
has been waiting her whole life

318
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,080
to marry this Nellie barber
loving, self-hating,

319
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,760
geriatric English teacher
who can't get it up for her,

320
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,680
and we're supposed to
feel sorry for her?

321
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,640
Aw.
No fucking way!

322
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,600
I mean, you do the math.

323
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,240
Where's the waiter
with my drink?

324
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,640
You want anything?

325
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,920
I'm not even going to mention
"Bird Cage."

326
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,040
- Can I get a diet coke?
- Sure.

327
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,200
All right. What was
your favorite movie of all time?

328
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,040
Let's just start with that.

329
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,720
I'm not a big fan
of the "favorites" game,

330
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,360
so why don't you go first?

331
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,360
Oh. Okay.

332
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,960
I know it sounds corny and
cliché, but I have to say

333
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,200
"Gone with the Wind."

334
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,120
I never saw it.

335
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,640
Yeah, right.

336
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,680
I didn't. I never saw
"Gone with the Wind."

337
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,920
You're kidding, right?

338
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,360
No, I'm not kidding.

339
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,640
Come on!

340
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,040
- I never saw the movie.
- You never saw the movie?

341
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,680
No, I never-

342
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,680
Okay, fine.

343
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,880
Want me to say
I saw the movie?

344
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,840
I will.
I saw the movie.

345
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,720
It was the best movie
I've ever seen.

346
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,440
Especially that part where
Red Buttons is up on a hill

347
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,440
with Charlotte?

348
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,320
Oh my God, you are scaring me.

349
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,040
What do you want me say?

350
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm not a big fan of
black and white movies.

351
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,760
Relax, relax.

352
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,640
I saw "Family" 1 5 times.
Does that help?

353
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,400
It's a start.

354
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,040
KE.

355
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,280
- What?
- What?

356
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,360
What did you just say?

357
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,200
Nothing.

358
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,240
You said something.

359
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,400
No, I didn't.

360
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,240
Yeah, you did.
You said "K," what is that?

361
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,040
It's nothing.
It's nothing.

362
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,680
It's stupid.

363
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,120
It's initial talk.

364
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,600
Bret and I have done it
for years.

365
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,920
It's stupid. It means nothing.
Trust me.

366
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,920
So I just took a hit.

367
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,920
No, you didn't.

368
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,280
Tom, believe me.
I swear to you.

369
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,520
Oh, damn it.

370
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,520
It means...

371
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,760
killer eyes, okay?

372
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,040
I'm gonna go, it's late,
and uh...

373
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,440
Yeah, let's you and I go
on our way- ways.

374
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,080
On our ways, separate,
you and me.

375
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,400
- Here, let's split it.
- No, I got it.

376
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,360
- No, let's split it.
- No, I want to do this.

377
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,360
- Please.
- Let me pay.

378
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,080
- Let me just split it.
- Let me do this.

379
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,960
- Let me pay for my own.
- Just go!

380
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,920
Going.

381
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,800
He hated me.

382
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,800
It was like I activated
his gag reflex.

383
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,400
That is the last time I let you
fix me up, you got that?

384
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,680
Next date I go on will
cost me $2 for the 1 st minute

385
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,200
and $1 .50
each additional minutes.

386
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,440
Did he mention
me and Jackie?

387
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,800
What?
No. It didn't come up.

388
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,720
Are you sure the guy
was even gay?

389
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,000
Are you kidding?

390
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,680
I don't know, with you...

391
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,440
How many straight guys
pretend their gay?

392
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,920
- Besides you?
- Hello!

393
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,120
He didn't
mention me?

394
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,560
You want eggs?
I'll add another.

395
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,560
Are there eggs?

396
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,520
- Yeah!
- Relax.

397
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,480
You're becoming crazy.

398
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,720
You've been whipping
for 20 minutes.

399
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,720
Your mother told me
you would be like this.

400
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,600
My mom called you again?

401
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,920
What did you tell her?

402
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,840
She's concerned about you.

403
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,320
You never talk to the woman.

404
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,400
She thinks you're becoming
a big loser.

405
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,920
That's nice, that's great.

406
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,240
Thanks, thanks for that.

407
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,560
It's easy for her to say.
I know what's out there.

408
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,920
Guys with
bad hair plugs,

409
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,200
staples in their dicks,

410
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,720
Beanie Baby collections
or worse.

411
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,240
- Worse?
- Oh, there's worse.

412
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,680
Come on, it'll be
so much better next time.

413
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,600
There won't be a next time.

414
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,720
Unless his name is
Ben, Jerry, or Jose Cuervo.

415
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,160
Uh-huh. Like you haven't all
ready had those guys.

416
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,280
And their brothers.

417
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,160
Haven't you ever wondered
what it's like

418
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,960
to be with the same guy
for more than five minutes?

419
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,840
The guys I meet, five minutes
is all it takes.

420
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,520
Charming.

421
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,360
More importantly...

422
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,960
what did Eli say about me?

423
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,680
Is it going to happen
with Bret?

424
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,160
I've no idea.
He didn't mention it.

425
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,200
Oh.

426
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,360
Like I care.

427
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,640
Maybe I should call Bret
and find out

428
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,880
what Eli said about your date.

429
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,160
I couldn't care less.

430
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,920
Right. Right.

431
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,760
We officially don't care.

432
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,800
I get it. Yeah.

433
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,680
I definitely
am not going to call.

434
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,720
Where're you going?

435
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,760
Home, to officially not call.

436
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,160
No, no, no. You were supposed
to stay here and watch

437
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,960
Lifetime Television
for women and gay men.

438
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,080
Uh, no.

439
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,280
It's Joan Van Arc and
not without my nose job.

440
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,120
Oh, angel,
I've all ready lived that movie.

441
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,960
That shit people say
about finding the one?

442
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,400
I'm sick of it.

443
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,440
Tom certainly isn't.

444
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,320
I don't think I'll ever
meet the one.

445
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,760
Your whole problem is

446
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,480
there is no such thing
as "the one."

447
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,600
You're such a liar.

448
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,240
Two seconds ago you told me
this girl Jackie is the one.

449
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,440
I met her one time.

450
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,400
She could be the one.
Or one of the ones.

451
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,600
There's notjust one one.

452
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,760
There's fractions of one,
half ones, quarter ones.

453
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,280
The idea is to make yourself
open to someone.

454
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,840
Perhaps Tom is a one.

455
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,280
Are you going to the flea
market with me tomorrow?

456
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,320
No, sweetie. By tomorrow, I'm
hoping to have plans with a man

457
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,840
who'll appreciate me
for my body,

458
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,840
notjust my brains and wit
and sense of style.

459
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,840
So, Dad's in town.

460
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,440
You're disgusting.

461
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,480
Why don't you take a date
to the flea market?

462
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,440
Ugh!

463
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,000
That is why
you never go steady.

464
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,360
I haven't gone steady
since the seventh grade.

465
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,440
You do the math.

466
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,520
Besides, he kept saying,
"You do the math,"

467
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,720
even if it made no sense.

468
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,040
What a turn off!

469
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,000
What's a turn on?

470
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,800
Per your mother,
you haven't had a hard-on

471
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,840
since you saw the Nutcracker

472
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,600
at the Jewish Community Center
in the first grade.

473
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,160
- You talk about my sex life?
- What sex life?

474
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,680
- I have one!
- Uh-huh.

475
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,880
- It counts.
- Right.

476
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,840
I spent 1 0 years learning
which buttons to push,

477
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,480
now I just look at myself
and I come.

478
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,240
( music playing )

479
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,800
- Everybody's looking for
something -

480
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,680
- Step right up and tell 'em
what it's all about -

481
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,480
- Don't you worry
'bout nothin' -

482
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,760
- If you see what you like -

483
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,640
- I'm sure we'll work it out -

484
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,480
- I'll come and see you
on Sundays -

485
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,400
- Eastside, westside,
uptown or down -

486
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,240
- And all your problems
will disappear -

487
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,960
- When you lay
your money down -

488
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,640
- Let's make a deal, man. -

489
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,640
Hey!

490
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,640
Hey!

491
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,400
Hey, how are you doing?

492
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,760
I'm good.
How are you?

493
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,960
Yeah, good.

494
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,480
You look good.

495
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,120
God, thanks.

496
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,240
No, no, really.

497
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,200
So, you were lying
the first time?

498
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,800
What?

499
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,840
No, you've got that fresh

500
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,920
Sunday-morning-read-the-paper-
cup-of-coffee look.

501
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,400
Here I thought I had that stale

502
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,880
Sunday morning-hangover-choke-
on-my-own-vomit thing going.

503
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,520
What are you here for?

504
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,680
Looking for anything
in particular?

505
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,160
Yeah. I'm looking for
a vintage martini set.

506
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,960
The shaker and the glasses.
The whole thing.

507
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,440
How about you?
You just browsing?

508
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,880
Me? Are you kidding?

509
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,840
I'd go nuts.

510
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,080
I have to look for one thing
and just one thing.

511
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,400
And that would be what?

512
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,960
A bathroom, actually.

513
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,680
I bet they don't have
bathrooms.

514
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,800
Probablyjust porta-potties.
God, I hate those.

515
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,120
My parents rented
four of them

516
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,320
for my sister's bat mitzvah.

517
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,080
You didn't come here
for a bathroom.

518
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,120
I didn't?

519
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,960
Okay.

520
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,520
I'm looking for an original
Cornelius action figure.

521
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,120
You know, from
"Planet of the Apes"?

522
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,080
You're yanking my chain, right?

523
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,440
Actually, no I'm not.

524
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,280
And I really hate
that expression.

525
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,680
Nice seeing you.
See you around.

526
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,720
No, no don't.

527
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,400
Come on,
have a sense of humor.

528
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,800
You're funny.
I'm not laughing at you.

529
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,880
Not funny bad,
you're funny good.

530
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,120
Why don't we
go grab a cup of coffee,

531
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,720
then I'll help you
find your dolly?

532
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,720
Action figure!

533
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,840
Is itjust the apes,
or do you have Betsy Wetsy too?

534
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,600
Jackie didn't say
you collected dolls.

535
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,800
Interesting. Bret didn't tell me
you were an asshole.

536
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,360
Speaking of which,
what's up with those two?

537
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,320
- Hi.
- Hi.

538
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,720
I thought you should know-
they hated each other.

539
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,560
Oh... right,
more than life itself.

540
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,120
N-no fucking chemistry.

541
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,040
I had the biggest
"Planet of the Apes" collection

542
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,000
until the sixth grade
when my parents made me sell it

543
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,080
at a garage sale.
They were afraid

544
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,760
it was going to adversely affect
my psycho-sexual development.

545
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,840
They're both shrinks.

546
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,520
- Know what did it?
- What?

547
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,920
Affect your psycho whatever?

548
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,920
I'm gay, aren't I?

549
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,640
So the apes made you gay?

550
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,120
I don't know.

551
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,480
What is that, the ape theory?

552
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,120
You've got a half-naked
Charleton Heston in a cage-

553
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,200
Where he belongs.

554
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,160
plus, my huge crush
on Roddy McDowall,

555
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,720
and those cute little
leather outfits?

556
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,600
That, my friend, is a gay,
pre-teen Happy Meal.

557
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,120
- Do you have any martini sets?
- I'm afraid not.

558
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,240
I gotta admit, I don't even know
what a martini set looks like.

559
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,960
I wouldn't know a martini
if it bit me in the ass.

560
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,400
It shouldn't, if you know
how to make them.

561
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,200
I take it you do?

562
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,720
In my house, you had to.

563
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,960
I couldn't tie my shoes
until I was 1 0,

564
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,360
but I could make a martini.

565
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,200
I was Isaac on our sinking
little Love Boat.

566
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,480
Thank you, sweetheart.

567
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,160
This is perfect.

568
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,680
Tell me, have you met any nice
girls at school this year?

569
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,560
Yeah, they're nice.

570
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,880
Have you given any thought
to what we talked about?

571
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,240
None of the other fifth graders

572
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,840
know what they'll do
after high school.

573
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,600
What do I care about a bunch
of pansy fifth graders

574
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,720
with silver spoons
in their mouths?

575
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,920
I sorta like the idea of
teaching. Teaching sounds good.

576
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,640
That's terrific, honey.

577
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,400
( mother chuckling )

578
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,480
I can't remember them
without a drink in their hand.

579
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,160
When my father used to pitch
baseballs to me in the backyard,

580
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,000
he never spilled a drop.

581
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,120
My God, I can't even imagine.

582
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,120
Your parents didn't drink?

583
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,360
No, we never played games
in the backyard.

584
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,440
Never?

585
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,400
First of all,
we didn't have a backyard.

586
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,680
And second of all, the closest
we ever came to a game was...

587
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,200
the "feel wheel."

588
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,320
Rage is at the top.

589
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,640
Then we move down

590
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:20,840
to frustration,
confusion, loneliness.

591
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,800
On the other side we have
loving, affectionate, silly.

592
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,720
Eli, you go first.

593
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,040
Take your name,

594
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,000
and put it on the emotion
you're feeling right now.

595
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,040
That's right, Eli.
Don't think. Look inside.

596
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:35,840
- What are you feeling?
- Right now, go.

597
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,560
Don't think- go!

598
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,600
Go!

599
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,880
Do I have to, Dr. Wyckoff?

600
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,120
Mother: Can you do it
for Mommy?

601
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,400
You'd be walking,
thinking,

602
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,040
"Gee, I feel happy," and you'd
put your flag on the wheel?

603
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,320
No, no, it was just...

604
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,080
something my parents
wanted us to do

605
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,880
so that they would feel
more enlightened.

606
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,200
Like getting us to say penis
and vagina at the dinner table.

607
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,600
You know, so that we'd feel
comfortable talking about sex?

608
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,920
It's probably why now I prefer
"pee-pee" and "who-who."

609
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,440
More pee-pee
than who-who, I'd imagine.

610
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,400
Does it show?

611
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,760
I don't think that game would
have been a hit in my house,

612
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,160
unless there was section
on the wheel for thirsty.

613
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,720
There was a section
on the wheel for scared...

614
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:32,320
but you'd have had
to share that one with me.

615
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,960
No chance on the Eli
and Tom thing?

616
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,640
What a pain.
The gays are so picky.

617
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:57,160
No, it's Eli. He's got
the worse D.K. on the planet.

618
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,840
Donna Karan?

619
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,680
No, "dating karma."
It sucks.

620
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,000
He told me that, A, he thinks he
insulted Tom a hundred times,

621
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,920
and B, that he's straight.

622
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,920
Tom is just a freak.

623
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,520
He officially hates any guy
that he likes,

624
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,240
or worse, who likes him.

625
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,120
What, dude?

626
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,800
Welcome to the wonderful
world of self-hate.

627
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,760
And he's not even Jewish.

628
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,520
What on God's earth is this?

629
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,120
That's the ugliest thing
I've seen in my entire life.

630
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,960
( clattering )

631
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,800
- 'Morning.
- 'Morning.

632
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,800
What's the hurry?

633
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,720
Today is decoupage day
at school and I'm late.

634
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,240
Okay.

635
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,560
Listen, I just...

636
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,800
want to apologize
for yesterday, and last night,

637
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,720
and it shouldn't
have happened.

638
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,920
Oh.

639
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,280
I feel we got off
to a really good start,

640
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,640
but then I feel like
I fucked things up.

641
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,760
So I promise it won't ever
happen again.

642
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,520
Good, I-

643
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,840
We shouldn't have.

644
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,520
Anyway, it was both
of our faults, so...

645
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,200
No, yeah, so let's pretend
it never happened.

646
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,240
Perfect.

647
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,480
Great. I'll see you later.

648
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,280
- Hey.
- How you doing?

649
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,320
( modem connecting )

650
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,080
We had a great time.
I don't get it.

651
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:34,520
Looked like you did get it-
something called "laid."

652
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,400
FYI, gay guys don't necessarily
play the same bases

653
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,360
that straight guys do.

654
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,080
It's still fucking, dude.

655
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,520
Hello, gentlemen.

656
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,880
You don't mind if the brother
hangs out, do you?

657
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,560
- I had him fixed.
- Do I have a choice?

658
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,920
I don't get the double standard.

659
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,680
Guys can do all kinds
of things with women,

660
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,280
but they don't call it sex
unless they actually fuck.

661
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,480
Like sex with interns.

662
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,360
I'm notjudging you.
It's just sex.

663
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,360
I'm not being defensive,

664
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,080
I'm trying to explain to you
that a guy can get together

665
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,360
with another guy and do all
kinds of things,

666
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,480
without necessarily...
you know.

667
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,200
Right. That's enough.

668
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,360
It's a big step.
I know couples who have never,

669
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,200
and probably will
never actually...

670
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,680
NT- new topic.

671
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,480
What is with you? You were
never this squeamish in college.

672
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,440
That's because you were
dating women.

673
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,520
It's the same thing
if you don't count the vaginas.

674
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,400
I count them. Four, so far.

675
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,720
Know what, Mitch?

676
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,480
It doesn't count if they have
inflate nozzles.

677
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:26,800
It's not like you picked them up
at Ye Old Cock 'N Balls,

678
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,760
and got out the butter spray

679
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,600
and choke collar
and the whole thing.

680
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,640
You spent an afternoon together.
Obviously he likes you.

681
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,600
Right.

682
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,640
Fuck, these are new.

683
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,840
What's the matter?
Are you cranky?

684
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,080
I don't want to do this anymore.
That's fine. That's great.

685
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,880
You did a terrific job.

686
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,000
Listen, what are you doing
on Friday night?

687
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,040
Are you gonna go out
with the guy?

688
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,600
I don't know.
Why, did Jackie say something?

689
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,160
I don't know, but if you come
on Friday night,

690
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,360
she can tell you herself.

691
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,440
I'm not doing that.
That's so seventh grade.

692
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,960
You'll catch up.

693
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,080
- Did she invite Tom?
- No, it's just us,

694
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,920
it'll be fine.
7:00 Friday night, all right?

695
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,440
All right. Take this.

696
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,160
Have a Valerian or something.
Take a nap.

697
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,040
He's too intense.
I like him as a friend, but-

698
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,080
Bullshit.

699
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:14,320
That is just fear of intimacy,
which is so 1991 . Pause.

700
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,760
- Marie?
- Yeah?

701
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,800
Put the headphones on.
The headphones.

702
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,760
There you go.

703
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:26,240
Nice, Marie, but I need
more smile and less sell.

704
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,160
Have fun.

705
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,520
Great... fun, right.
Top notch.

706
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,480
The way you did
in the audition, remember?

707
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,040
The reason we hired you?

708
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:38,880
Right, absolutely.
Good note. Really good note.

709
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,960
Great.

710
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,680
"New Vita-Power Energy Bars

711
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,120
with tasty, chewy goodness
in every bite."

712
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,520
I'm just glad you met a guy
with half a brain in his head.

713
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:52,320
Let me find the love in that.
Oh, right, there is none!

714
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,480
I'm not the one who
fell in love with a guy

715
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,640
who could only get a job
selling sperm samples

716
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,360
and doing experimental
drug research.

717
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,920
Wasn't he allergic?

718
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,360
Yes, but he was cute
and you know it.

719
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,640
Yeah, when the hives cleared up.

720
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,320
"...during and after
your living and giving life."

721
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,960
Pause.

722
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,480
- Sweetie?
- Yeah?

723
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:14,040
What are you doing?
You're not Kathleen Turner, okay?

724
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:18,360
No, I'm not. I'm not
Kathleen Turner. That's right.

725
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,600
I'm me. Is that what you're
saying? I should be me?

726
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,760
No, what I'm saying is that this
isn't Blue Cross, Blue Shield-

727
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,000
it's an energy snack.

728
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,640
So why don't we have,
I don't know... energy?

729
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,160
Energy! Of course!
You're right.

730
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,640
Because it's Vita-Power,
and "Vita" means life.

731
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,520
Correct me if I'm wrong,

732
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:42,480
my intention should be to have-
to give more life.

733
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,320
Except as a bar.

734
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,280
But Jackie, can I-

735
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,960
my concern is that I'm going
to be over the top.

736
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,560
No, honey, you're so under
the top right now,

737
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,200
it's like you're selling me
a douche.

738
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,320
I'm getting you on the beach
in a floral print dress,

739
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,240
talking about feminine
freshness.

740
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,480
Is that the read
you're going for?

741
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,360
No, that's not.
Those were good word pictures.

742
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,560
Just translate them
for what I need...

743
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:11,240
good, yeah, I can do this.
I'm just gonna keep going.

744
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,120
You are so mean. You're not
even listening to her.

745
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,760
Yes, I am. She thinks she's
doing books on tape.

746
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,000
- I think she's good.
- Don't change the subject.

747
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,160
Bret and I are cooking dinner
on Friday night.

748
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,920
What are you having?

749
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,240
Shut up, you're coming.

750
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,640
Is "he" invited?

751
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,480
No, just you.

752
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,880
Pause.

753
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,240
That's it. Go home.

754
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,080
You want me to go?
I should go home?

755
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,480
No, you're incredible.

756
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,760
That voice?
Don't even kid yourself-

757
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,680
you're gonna have
a huge career.

758
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,200
I thought... thank you.
Thanks to you!

759
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,760
Jackie's a piece of work.

760
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,240
Bret's a lying sack of shit.

761
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,280
You look good.

762
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,240
I have no idea.

763
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,920
If it's a sports figure,
I'll kill you.

764
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,720
- Julia White!
- No, no, no.

765
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,680
Eli Weizel!

766
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,800
You're actually not my partner.
Come on! Go go go!

767
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,400
What makes you think I know?

768
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,240
Come on! All right, pass!

769
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,880
This one... fuck! Open!

770
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,480
The ex-football player
who allegedly killed his wife.

771
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,000
Oh-oh-oh-oh... "allegedly"?
What, are you nuts?

772
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,320
- Just say it!
- O.J. Simpson.

773
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,040
Yes!

774
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,080
It's like saying Jackie
allegedly got a nose job.

775
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,440
Shut up.

776
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,280
Both of you shut up!
The first name rhymes with this.

777
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,240
Could you never,
ever do that again?

778
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,640
Just say it!

779
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,240
Time! Time, time, time.

780
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,720
Bret, is it maybe time?

781
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,880
- Who the fuck was that?
- I bet it was one of Brad's.

782
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,840
They're so hard,
because he's so smart.

783
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,240
Apparently not smart enough
to know you had a nose job.

784
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,520
- I told you about that.
- No, you didn't.

785
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,320
So what's the diff?

786
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,680
Come on, Bret,
like you couldn't tell?

787
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,160
Every Jewish teen-age girl with
money winds up with that nose.

788
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,560
Don't you think
it's a little bit weird

789
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,480
that everyone on the planet
knows but your boyfriend?

790
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,320
Seriously, Eli, who was that?

791
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,120
I was doing the hula, so-

792
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,280
It's a little strange. Right?

793
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,200
They used to call me the jackal.

794
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,840
So I got a nose job.
Are you happy now?

795
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,200
I give up, what
rhymes with hula?

796
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,240
Jackal? That's brutal.

797
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,160
You're being a jerk.

798
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,680
But I'm being an honestjerk,
so that counts for something.

799
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,240
Wait, shh! You hear that?

800
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,160
That's the sound of you
not getting laid tonight.

801
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,200
Bret: That's wonderful.

802
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,200
Did you guys hear that?

803
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,520
That was the sound
of Jackie being a bitch.

804
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,480
Did you guys hear that?

805
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,440
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

806
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,440
Jackie: What do you want
from me?

807
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,640
How about a little honesty?

808
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,760
The self-pity bus stops
right in front of my building.

809
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,160
Don't miss it.

810
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,160
Maybe I'll get
on the self-pity bus-

811
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,600
- You do that!
- and maybe I'll get a transfer.

812
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,480
Can we get outta here

813
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,320
before they start
looking like my parents?

814
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,240
- Fine with me.
- Your place?

815
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,360
Yeah, okay-

816
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,440
Was that Tallulah Bankhead?

817
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,680
No, Rula Lenska.

818
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,600
Rula Lenska.

819
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,960
Who the fuck is Rula Lenska?

820
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,840
Guess they made up.

821
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,760
Hope she paid for Scotchgard.

822
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,720
Don't do that.
No, not right now.

823
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,560
Eli: Like when people say
"excetera" instead of "et cetera."

824
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,600
What is that, "excetera"?
It's crazy.

825
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:41,000
My favorite is
"for all intensive purposes."

826
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,520
That's nuts. It's like,
"Where did you go to school?"

827
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,480
Are you sure you don't
want a sandwich?

828
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,040
I don't know how you could
eat that food.

829
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,600
No offense, but Jackie
can't cook for shit.

830
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,280
No wonder Brett's
losing weight.

831
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,160
Hollywood News.
Where's your section?

832
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,480
- No, you don't have to.
- Come on.

833
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,440
It's embarrassing.

834
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,200
That's it, right there.

835
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,080
Look at that, "Police Blotter,
edited by Eli Wyckoff."

836
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,400
I don't want you to...

837
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,720
"Juan A. Maas, 35,
arrested early Sunday for DUI.

838
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,520
Blood alcohol level was 2.1

839
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,160
when suspect was
apprehinded' by LAPD."

840
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,120
What?

841
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,720
It says "apprehinded."

842
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,680
No, it doesn't.
It's apprehended.

843
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,040
It says apprehinded.

844
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,960
Oh my God! Shit!

845
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,480
To apprehind,
that's what...

846
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,080
that's when they grab
the guy on the ass?

847
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,760
God damn it, I proofed this
like a million times! God!

848
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,400
Relax.

849
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,560
- Do you know what you need?
- A newjob.

850
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,440
No, you need a drink.

851
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,440
A drink. A real drink.

852
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,200
Do you have any vodka?

853
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,720
I don't know.

854
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,880
Is this vodka?
I've had it since 1947.

855
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,880
Do you have martini glasses?

856
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,600
Those are my martini glasses...

857
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,880
and myjuice glasses
and my water glasses.

858
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,480
Never mind, they'll do.

859
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,160
I am going to introduce you to
the wonderful world of martinis.

860
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,200
( phone ringing )

861
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,760
No, screen, screen.

862
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,480
- Let me get it.
- Let the machine get it.

863
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,600
I bet you can't do it.

864
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,600
I can do it.

865
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,520
I dare you.

866
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,920
All right.

867
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,960
Hi, this is Eli.
Leave a message.

868
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,680
I gotta get that piece
of shit machine fixed.

869
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,160
Eli, this is Dr. Wyckoff.

870
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,160
There's something wrong
with your machine.

871
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,400
- That's your shrink?
- My mom.

872
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,360
You refer to her-

873
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,840
It took her 1 2 years
to get her Ph.D.

874
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,280
She likes to hear
herself say it.

875
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,640
- Now move.
- No.

876
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,640
Move, I'm serious.
It's not funny.

877
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,560
I was just reading the
New England Journal of Medicine

878
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,640
and there's a pullout section
on the new TSE-

879
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,520
Testicular Self-Examine. How to
make it part of your lifestyle.

880
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,840
- My God.
- Do you want to try?

881
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,000
No, come on. Goddamn it!

882
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,240
I faxed a diagram
over to your office.

883
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,200
I put your name all over it.

884
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,240
- Oh my God.
- Oh my God.

885
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,560
Don't listen, don't listen.

886
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,240
...the hues just hit you
right in the face.

887
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,680
You may want to give yourself
an exam while I read aloud.

888
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,080
I think we should
do this exam together.

889
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,000
Let's take a deep breath
together.

890
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,440
Start by lifting the penis
to one side.

891
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,960
Oh my God!

892
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,640
Slowly roll the testicle
between the thumb and fingers,

893
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,000
applying slight pressure.

894
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,400
Hello, Mom, it's me.

895
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,320
Mom: Who?

896
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:32,080
- Eli?
- Eli, are we screening?

897
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,800
Yeah-no, I wasn't actually.
We just got in.

898
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,120
Mom: "We"?

899
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,640
What does that mean?

900
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,000
Eli: Can I call you back?
Mom: Do we have company?

901
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:40,960
Yes.

902
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:42,960
Mom: Jewish?

903
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,920
No, but...

904
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,880
Cute?

905
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,400
Eli: Will you stop?
Mom: Wear a condom.

906
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,360
Oh, God, Mom, no,
it's not like that.

907
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,680
Mom: You hear
about the TSE?

908
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,200
Did you hear
what I was talking about?

909
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,080
Yeah, we both did. Thanks.

910
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,920
Maybe you both could
do it together then,

911
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,920
nothing wrong with helping each
other with a testicular exam.

912
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,640
- Mom.
- Don't be shy.

913
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,040
I got to call you later, okay?

914
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,120
Wait a second, honey.
Call me tomorrow morning-

915
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,280
Goodbye.

916
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,400
I feel so dirty.

917
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,520
So, why does it matter
if I'm Jewish?

918
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,200
You heard that?

919
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,320
Oh, yeah.

920
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,320
Oh, my God.

921
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,280
I'll be in the bathroom,

922
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,440
hoping to God that I can
overdose on Tums or Maalox

923
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,120
or pine scented Glade.
I'm so embarrassed.

924
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,920
Don't be.
It wasn't that bad.

925
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,920
Eli: Really?

926
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,880
It was funny, actually.

927
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,880
Call Mom for me.

928
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,880
I can not talk to her.

929
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,600
The woman stopped having
boundaries

930
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,000
when she stopped
wearing a bra.

931
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,160
And the fact
that I know that-

932
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,080
I know, it's scary.

933
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,800
Does she pull that shit
with you?

934
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,880
Are you kidding?

935
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,440
She wanted me
to tape my first time

936
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,560
for her evaluation.

937
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,720
Eli: And?

938
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,160
I'm not telling you.

939
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,320
Did I tell you she sent me
this article

940
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,920
about circle jerks
and the new safe sex?

941
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,640
Can you believe
I thought circle jerks

942
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,280
was a figure skating term?

943
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,880
It is among
the male figure skaters.

944
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,320
Will you please
call her for me, please?

945
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,280
I can't talk to her.

946
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,760
You can't fight it.

947
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,080
The more you avoid her,
the more she's going

948
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,720
to insist on meeting- what's
your boyfriend's name?

949
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,440
Tom, and he's not my boyfriend.

950
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,400
Whatever.

951
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,640
I don't know
what he is.

952
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,880
What do you want him to be?

953
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:17,840
It's like...

954
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,400
I just wish I knew,

955
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,800
one way or the other.

956
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:26,240
Okay, put the bong down,
space cowboy.

957
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,720
He's your fucking boyfriend,
just like I said.

958
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,360
Tom: Eli!

959
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,600
( music playing )

960
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:47,880
- When you said to me -

961
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:51,560
- You are not so old -

962
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:55,040
- Did I know it then? -

963
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,440
- 'Cause I've just been told -

964
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,200
- I didn't think I'd find you -

965
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,880
- Perfect in so many ways -

966
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,800
- But I've been waiting... -

967
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,400
What's with you
and nudity?

968
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,840
Nothing,
but that movie was pandering.

969
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,200
It was an art film.

970
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,080
Yeah, the art of guys
with six-pack abs

971
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,920
blowing each other
every chance they get.

972
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,680
Every gay guy in LA
is "run don't walk."

973
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,160
The problem with that is...?

974
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,120
You might as well
stay home and watch

975
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,720
"The Hand that Rocks My Ladle."

976
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,880
Or "Pocahoncho."

977
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,640
At least those movies
don't pretend to be

978
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,600
what they're not.

979
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,520
You have those?
Pop them in.

980
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,120
Oh, God!
You're part of the problem.

981
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,400
Let me get this straight,

982
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,280
you think a movie about two guys
can't be about love, just sex?

983
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,400
Those guys were in love.

984
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,240
But it was
a special kind of love,

985
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,040
The kind of love
that required latex.

986
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,800
Oh my God.
Never mind.

987
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,560
I can't argue
with a guy who never saw

988
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,080
"Gone with the Wind."
What is that?

989
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,240
God, would you relax?

990
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,480
You're gonna have
an aneurysm.

991
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,880
You are infuriating.

992
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,760
You don't have to-

993
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,640
Do you want me to stop?

994
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,240
No.

995
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,120
You always smell so good.

996
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,360
Okay, there you go.

997
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,240
So Saturday is tennis, right?

998
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:22,640
Must be an open from Australia,
British, Pakistani, right?

999
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,360
Is something wrong?

1000
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,000
No, I just want
to watch TV.

1001
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,760
That's okay,
I get it.

1002
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:35,920
Get what?

1003
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,200
Same as usual.

1004
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,960
The whole
come-here-go-away routine.

1005
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,600
Do you want me
to keep massaging you? I will.

1006
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,600
But I tell you,

1007
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,440
this isn't the way
to get me to want to.

1008
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,960
Tom, it's actually fine.

1009
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,880
You're not attracted to me,

1010
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,000
you want to be just friends,
I can handle that.

1011
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,800
But then stop
fucking calling me,

1012
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,320
inviting me to see semi-porn
on a Saturday afternoon,

1013
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,360
then drive me back to my house,
and start rubbing my shoulders

1014
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,640
and expect me to be like,

1015
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,840
"Hey, buddy, thanks a lot,
I'll see you around."

1016
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,680
What is so wrong with
taking things slow?

1017
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,920
Why does it always have to be
all or nothing with you?

1018
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:08,880
I don't know.

1019
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,040
All right, then maybe we should
cool it offfor a while.

1020
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,120
No, I like you, I do.

1021
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,080
Thank you.

1022
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,640
I want to have a good time.

1023
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,760
I don't want this intense thing.

1024
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,320
And you seem to want this...

1025
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,240
I don't know,
what do you want?

1026
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:34,960
Eggs, actually.

1027
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,280
Whatever.

1028
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,520
Remember cooties?

1029
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,680
Don't touch the losers
or you get cooties?

1030
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,240
And who were the losers?

1031
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,320
Easy.

1032
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,920
Anybody with a hard-boiled egg
in their lunch bag.

1033
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,480
I don't think Tom liked
what I had in my lunch bag.

1034
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,760
Eli, let it out.

1035
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,800
No, I don't want
to talk about it.

1036
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:10,760
Cop out!

1037
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,920
Why do you feel the need
to beat yourself up?

1038
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,880
Why won't you
let us into the now?

1039
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,560
Why do I feel like I'm in
a cheesy 70s EST seminar?

1040
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,360
Good, how else do you feel?

1041
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,080
Would you like us
to bring out the feel wheel?

1042
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,360
I would actually like it

1043
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,600
if you would just leave me alone
for a little while.

1044
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,040
Let me in.
I'm not going to hurt you,

1045
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,200
I'm your friend.
What is wrong?

1046
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:40,760
I'm fine, okay?

1047
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,040
I don't think so.

1048
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,280
It's this guy.

1049
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,280
I knew it.

1050
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,760
He has this reputation
for being sort of easy.

1051
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,720
Mm-hmm.

1052
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,240
Not with me.

1053
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,240
With me, it's hard.

1054
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,320
Or not hard,
maybe that's the problem.

1055
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,840
Oh, Eli, what is this?

1056
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,280
I hate this movie.

1057
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,320
David, come in here.

1058
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,280
You won't believe
what they're showing again.

1059
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,200
What a piece of shit film,
honestly.

1060
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,320
- We're supposed to believe-
- They showed it last week.

1061
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,080
that this woman is
going to fall in love with

1062
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,280
a middle-aged homophobic
self-hating teacher

1063
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,920
who's only now discovered
he's gay.

1064
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,880
- We hated this movie.
- I don't think so!

1065
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,160
Both: Change the channel!

1066
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,120
Fuck you!

1067
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,680
Hi.

1068
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:46,640
Hi, Sunny.

1069
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,840
Oh, honey,
that's so sweet.

1070
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,320
Right now the thought offood
makes me want to borscht.

1071
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,400
Pretty picture
to wake up to, huh?

1072
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:04,640
Well, A, I can't imagine
waking up to any other picture.

1073
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,160
And B...

1074
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,720
I don't ever want to have to.

1075
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,400
What is this?

1076
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,880
Those are capers.
I made them on the side.

1077
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,360
Oh, my God!

1078
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,360
Oh, my God!

1079
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,040
Oh, shit!

1080
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,240
Do you...

1081
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,480
Oh no, no, no.

1082
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,080
Of course I'll marry you.

1083
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,880
It's just now everybody's
going to think

1084
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,440
we're doing it
because I'm pregnant.

1085
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,320
Oh, my God!

1086
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:47,880
Oh, my God!

1087
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:52,800
Mr. Preggers!
Wake up, Mr. Preggers!

1088
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,720
We should never
have fooled around.

1089
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,960
I know, why don't you
have some more wine?

1090
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:00,960
What can I say?

1091
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
He doesn't make me
weak in the knees.

1092
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,680
Please, that is exactly
why you should be with him.

1093
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:08,120
The ones that make you dizzy
are only good for a quick fuck.

1094
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,760
The rest are
marriage material.

1095
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,360
Like Bret.

1096
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:15,040
That is exactly
what I'm afraid of.

1097
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:18,760
Wait what?

1098
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,920
Wow!

1099
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,160
Wow, that was fast!

1100
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,880
Well, tick-tock, you know?

1101
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,400
You're crazy!

1102
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,920
I want you to be
my man of honor.

1103
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,320
There's no such thing.

1104
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,600
So. You're my best friend.

1105
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,360
I can't imagine
anybody else by my side.

1106
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,840
And your first duty,
as my personal slave,

1107
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,160
is to pretend to love it.

1108
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,200
Fine, fine.

1109
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,400
Jackie: Thanks. I love you.

1110
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:04,640
It's Jackie...

1111
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,080
again.

1112
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:07,680
Hello?

1113
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,440
Jackie: Where are you?

1114
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,520
Call me back, stat.

1115
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:32,040
Message: Hi, this is Tom.
Leave a message, or don't.

1116
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,400
- ( beep )
- This is the bride-to-be.

1117
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,960
I really wouldn't mind

1118
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,880
having my best friend
around right now,

1119
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,480
being that it's the most
important time of my life.

1120
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,080
But hey, maybe

1121
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,680
that's too much to ask for.

1122
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:50,480
- Just to see your face again -

1123
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,920
- Just to make you smile -

1124
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,640
- Would set me free -

1125
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:03,480
- If I could bring you back -

1126
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:07,040
- That would be
the sweetest thing -

1127
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:10,000
- If I could bring you back -

1128
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:15,440
- To me. -

1129
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,000
Freeze!

1130
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,960
Jack, Jack, pick up, it's me.

1131
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,400
Jackie, please pick up.

1132
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:31,960
I met someone...

1133
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:32,920
apparently.

1134
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,840
Fuck!

1135
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,720
Listen, Jack,

1136
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:46,360
I'm really sorry I haven't
returned your calls.

1137
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,960
I've been a shit, and...

1138
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,200
it's me, it's not you.

1139
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,760
Like you don't know that.

1140
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,920
Jack, I really need
to talk to you.

1141
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,640
I'm freaking out here.

1142
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:06,280
Jesus.

1143
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:09,640
This guy has the number eight
tattooed on his-

1144
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,480
Wait.

1145
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:15,320
Correction, it says
"Eighth Wonder."

1146
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:18,720
I really know how to pick them.
Jack, please call me back.

1147
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:28,840
Open your eyes
and look at me.

1148
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,920
No, I don't think
I will kiss you.

1149
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,920
Although you need
kissing badly...

1150
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,360
...if the right moment
ever came.

1151
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,240
You're a conceited black-hearted
varmint, Rhett Butler.

1152
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,040
I don't know why
I let you come see me.

1153
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:51,280
I'll tell you why, Scarlett.
The war can't last much longer.

1154
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,320
Really, Rhett? Why?

1155
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,400
There's a little battle
going on right now...

1156
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,000
( phone ringing )

1157
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,600
Hello?

1158
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:03,960
How've you been?

1159
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,880
- Okay.
- Good.

1160
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:14,800
Listen...

1161
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,680
What?

1162
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:20,960
What I was going to say was

1163
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,080
I've been procrastinating
about this whole wedding thing.

1164
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:27,160
I haven't gotten a gift
for Jackie's shower yet.

1165
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,360
I guess I'm in denial.

1166
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,280
I'm sure it's not
the first time.

1167
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:35,160
Right.

1168
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:39,360
Tom, I never got the email
that our cooling off period

1169
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,080
was officially over.

1170
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:44,320
And frankly, I'd like
to renew my option.

1171
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,360
- Ummm...
- 'Bye.

1172
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,480
- ( phone ringing )
- Fuck, fuck, fuck...

1173
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:56,000
Hi, this is Eli.
Leave a message.

1174
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:57,160
It's Tom again. Listen...

1175
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,000
Now he's fucking with me.
That's great.

1176
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:02,400
...mean we can't buy
a baby gift together.

1177
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,320
- I hate people like this.
- I know.

1178
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,880
They play this game.
Once you decide to play too,

1179
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,000
they don't want to play anymore.
What the fuck is that?

1180
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:11,200
I'm starting to think that's
all there is out there anymore.

1181
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,160
That's wrong.

1182
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:16,120
No, here's what I think.
I think who I am, what I've been-

1183
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,680
is not working so much anymore.

1184
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,880
From now on there's going
to be a whole new Eli.

1185
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,680
The whole love thing,
I don't buy it.

1186
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,000
How come it works for me?

1187
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,280
You're so full of shit.
It doesn't work for you.

1188
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:26,840
You fall in love with
a different person each week.

1189
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:27,600
My point exactly.

1190
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:31,000
No, you fall in love
with the idea of being in love.

1191
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,760
With a married man. To what?

1192
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,600
So you can experience the rush
of breaking up a family?

1193
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,080
Now you fall in love with a deaf
guy to learn sign language?

1194
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,400
Well, I did.

1195
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,440
Honey, this does not
constitute sign language.

1196
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:43,080
And then with a woman,
just to piss off Mom and Dad.

1197
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:45,040
How much did that backfire?

1198
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:47,680
That's the year they decided
to run for co-president of p-flag.

1199
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:51,200
You know what? From now it's
going to be one night stands,

1200
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,440
casual sex, just a lot
of close friends.

1201
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,080
You sound pathetic.

1202
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,800
No, for the first time
in my life,

1203
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:58,600
I think I actually make sense.

1204
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,840
Great, glad to help you through
the pain. 'Bye-bye.

1205
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,640
'Bye. I'll call you later.

1206
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:06,440
Will you tell that other Eli to
give me a call? This one sucks.

1207
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,600
( phone ringing )

1208
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:10,680
It's that's him,
you're not going shopping.

1209
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,280
FYI, the only reason I'm here

1210
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:17,480
is because your whole
"tires got slashed" story

1211
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,240
was so much more believable

1212
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,120
than the first 1 3 messages
you left me.

1213
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:24,000
I thought I had you with
the tickets to X-Files on Ice.

1214
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,920
I already saw it.

1215
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,720
I always wanted one
when I was a kid.

1216
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,760
Surprising, huh?

1217
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,440
Oh my God,
I had so many dolls.

1218
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:38,880
My dad would've killed me.

1219
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,160
- Really?
- Yeah.

1220
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,640
My house was like
a free-for-all.

1221
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,160
My sister had all these
Barbies and Kens,

1222
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,520
and my parents made me
play with them.

1223
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,280
Your parents forced you
to play with dolls?

1224
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,560
It was just so I could learn
the names of all the body parts.

1225
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,680
Pick whichever doll you like.

1226
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:56,640
It's your choice.
They're all beautiful.

1227
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,840
Good. Now switch.

1228
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,320
What do you call this?

1229
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:07,760
Vagina!

1230
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:11,440
Yes, vagina.
Good, Rayna. Eli?

1231
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:13,760
Vagina.

1232
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:15,400
Vagina.

1233
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,400
Now say it like you mean it.

1234
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,040
Va-gi-na.

1235
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:20,480
Vagina.

1236
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:22,400
Yes, yes.

1237
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:26,520
I always thought Ken was gay.

1238
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,360
He was when I got through
with him.

1239
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,720
That's another story.

1240
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:34,840
You and Ken together
is strangely erotic.

1241
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:41,560
We have been known to do private
shows, if you're interested.

1242
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,800
Not today.

1243
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,760
O-kay.

1244
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:53,440
Hello there, Eli.
I'm Fuzzy Wuzzy the bear.

1245
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:01,440
Jackie would love this bear.

1246
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,880
Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear,
Fuzzy Wuzzy had no hair

1247
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:09,720
Fuzzy Wuzzy wasn't
very fuzzy, was he?

1248
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,200
Was he? Was he? Was he...

1249
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,520
- was he, was he-
- Wuzzy.

1250
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:15,680
Wuzzy! Wuzzy!

1251
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,400
That's what I said.

1252
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:21,680
No, you said, "was he."
It's Wuzzy.

1253
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,400
What's the difference?

1254
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:24,840
You're kidding, right?

1255
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:28,120
You just establish that
Fuzzy Wuzzy had no hair.

1256
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,680
Why would you
then ask "was he"?

1257
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:32,480
Like a question, like you didn't
know if he was fuzzy or not.

1258
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:35,600
It is a question. I am asking
if Fuzzy is or isn't fuzzy.

1259
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:36,600
What is so wrong about that?

1260
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,000
It is a rhetorical question.
There is no answer to it.

1261
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,000
It's supposed to be ironic.

1262
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,920
Fuzzy Wuzzy wasn't
very fuzzy... wuzzy?

1263
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,360
I don't think it's that obvious

1264
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,680
that Fuzzy Wuzzy was
or wasn't fuzzy.

1265
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:02,240
It is the point
of the whole goddamn thing.

1266
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:03,520
Why are you so uptight?

1267
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:04,480
I'm not.

1268
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:05,960
There always has to be
a right way with you

1269
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,960
and a wrong way with you.

1270
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,400
Is that why you like
being with me?

1271
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,920
So you can feel like
you're right all the time?

1272
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,960
What? No.

1273
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,040
Is that what you think?

1274
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:21,440
Alls I know is you have
this rigid idea of how I should be.

1275
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,440
"Alls you know"?

1276
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,360
All right, I can't.

1277
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:31,200
Fuck!

1278
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:33,120
This is mine mine mine!

1279
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:36,200
I love this.

1280
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,440
Enjoy it now,
because in a month or so,

1281
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,440
you're going to be
ripping at the seams.

1282
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:43,120
( woman laughing )

1283
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:43,840
I'm gonna kill you.

1284
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:46,400
Rachel, could you shut
the fuck up?

1285
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:48,480
You're cackling like an idiot.

1286
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:51,360
Liz, grab some bows and help us
with the rehearsal bouquet.

1287
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:53,640
Why do you want me to do it?

1288
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:56,040
'Cause you think it's the only
time I'll get to hold one?

1289
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:58,720
Liz, what time is therapy, hon'?
Do they make house calls?

1290
01:00:58,760 --> 01:00:59,720
That's really sweet.

1291
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:01,280
Very supportive.
I'm taking my gift back.

1292
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:02,480
I'll make it, I'll make it.

1293
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:04,240
- Thank you, nice person.
- Thank you, Tom.

1294
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:05,200
( knocking )

1295
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:07,520
Wait, the door!
Get the door!

1296
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:13,520
Is Jackie here?

1297
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:16,440
Woman: Jackie, did you forget
to pay some parking tickets?

1298
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,880
- Are you Jackie Gold?
- I'll be Jackie Gold!

1299
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,720
Jackie: I'm gonna
kill you guys.

1300
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,200
I can't believe you did this.

1301
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:27,960
Jackie, you have been a bad,
bad, bad girl, haven't you?

1302
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,880
- Oh baby!
- ( dance music playing )

1303
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,320
Put that thing away.

1304
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:50,080
Jackie: You work that booty!

1305
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,840
This is it!

1306
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:00,080
That is going to be amazing.

1307
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,280
Enough with the pictures.

1308
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:03,440
No, it's great!
Just one more!

1309
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,240
- Ring!
- Okay.

1310
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:08,440
Forget about it, can we talk
about our friend the cop?

1311
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,520
Rachel: You mean your future
ex-husband?

1312
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,640
Tom: So how long have you
been doing this?

1313
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:14,560
- Too long.
- Yeah?

1314
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:20,880
Woman #1 : Let me ask you this...

1315
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:22,840
how many of these gifts
can I take home with me?

1316
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:23,920
Woman #2: You're crazy.

1317
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:26,080
Woman #1 : I wrap beautifully,
though.

1318
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:28,800
Woman #2: Don't you think we
should share?

1319
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,800
You don't even like mine.
Can I take it back?

1320
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,880
Excuse me one second.

1321
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:37,320
So, you know, I've been
kind of bad myself.

1322
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:38,320
You have?

1323
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:40,240
( tires screeching )

1324
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:59,880
- Please forgive me
if I act a little strange -

1325
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:04,920
- For I know not what I do... -

1326
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,080
( doorbell ringing )

1327
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:13,000
- Feels like lightning running
through my veins -

1328
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:19,040
- Every time I look at you... -

1329
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:23,520
Hey.

1330
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:25,560
Hey.

1331
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,000
How much do I owe you?

1332
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:29,360
$9.22.

1333
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,240
Why don't you keep that?

1334
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,000
- Thanks a lot.
- Have a good night.

1335
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:34,800
You too. Thanks.

1336
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:38,200
- And there's so much
I want to say -

1337
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:46,120
Wanna tell you
just how good it feels... -

1338
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:52,360
- Hey.
- Hi.

1339
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:58,240
Where did you find this?

1340
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:00,480
Internet.

1341
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,480
Thank you.

1342
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,440
I took it out of the box
so you could play with it.

1343
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,120
It came in a box?

1344
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:12,480
- The original box?
- Mm-hmm.

1345
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:13,440
Where is it?

1346
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:15,400
I tossed it. Why?

1347
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:18,840
Why?

1348
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:21,960
Never mind.

1349
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:32,440
Tom: And then it happened.

1350
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,360
What?

1351
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:38,880
We went where no two men should
ever go without a prescription.

1352
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:40,920
Trust me, you don't want
the details.

1353
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,640
Are you nuts?

1354
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:45,000
At my age, the details
are all I got.

1355
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:48,600
Take off your...

1356
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:49,600
Ouch!

1357
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,560
Sorry.

1358
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:56,320
- Let's not...
- What?

1359
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:59,640
- Let go of my leg.
- Sorry, sorry.

1360
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,560
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1361
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:06,800
Wait.

1362
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:09,280
Don't you want to?

1363
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:10,800
Do you have a thingy?

1364
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,840
Shut up.

1365
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:14,920
You know what I mean.
You know what I mean?

1366
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,880
Yeah, yeah.

1367
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:26,680
- Tom?
- Yeah?

1368
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:27,760
Look at me.

1369
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:30,600
I... love you.

1370
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:31,200
Oh my God.

1371
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:33,520
I love you.

1372
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:35,440
Oh my God!

1373
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:01,880
I'm hungry.

1374
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:03,200
Yeah?

1375
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:05,440
You like eggs? Why don't
I make some eggs?

1376
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:11,360
I'm supposed to meet my parents
at the country club for brunch.

1377
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,240
Do you want to come?

1378
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:23,280
Hey.

1379
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:25,200
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetheart.

1380
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,720
- Hey, Dad.
- Tom.

1381
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,560
This is Eli.

1382
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:32,960
Hi, it's nice to meet you.

1383
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:33,960
- Hello, Eli.
- Hi.

1384
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,400
Nice to meet you.

1385
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:38,440
Why don't we all sit down?

1386
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:40,360
Lydia and I can share a menu.

1387
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,720
I'll get another setup.

1388
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,440
You guys want coffee
orjuice or anything?

1389
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:47,080
Yeah, coffee with milk.

1390
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:50,880
Can I get a mimosa and a coffee?
And a water.

1391
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:53,240
You'll fill up on liquids.
Save room for your meal.

1392
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:55,000
- Leave him alone, Lydia.
- I wasn't criticizing.

1393
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:57,600
He's obviously old enough
to please himself.

1394
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:02,360
So... what have you guys
been up to?

1395
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:07,600
Not much, really. We got back
from Keenan on Friday...

1396
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:10,400
and then I took the girls
from my church group

1397
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,000
to see "Phantom of the Opera."

1398
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:13,200
Is that still running?

1399
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:15,160
It was Friday night.

1400
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:17,320
Right, I didn't know.

1401
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,280
Father: $75 a shot.

1402
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:21,240
It's absurd. It's like throwing
money in the trash.

1403
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:23,560
- It's theater, Jim.
- It's trash, Lydia.

1404
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:26,200
Tom: All right, all right.
How was it up at Keenan?

1405
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:31,800
What? What's wrong?

1406
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,600
Now's not the time, honey.

1407
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:36,320
So there's a right time
to ask about Amy?

1408
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:41,040
- Stupid.
- Excuse me?

1409
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:42,200
You heard me, Lydia.

1410
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,560
You talk to me like that,
you'll see what you get from me.

1411
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:45,920
Is that a threat, Lydia?

1412
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:48,440
- Dad, could you not-
- Shut up, Tom.

1413
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:50,400
Mother: That's rich.

1414
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:56,120
Let's go.

1415
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,160
Come on, let's go.

1416
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:00,440
Let go of me,
don't do that.

1417
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,760
Don't do that,
get your hands off me.

1418
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,040
- I told you do not...
- You always do this...

1419
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:18,040
Let's go.

1420
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:22,360
Tom, the valet's that way.

1421
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:25,080
I'm not ready. If you want
to go, I'll take a cab.

1422
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:37,160
It's a nice club.

1423
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:39,720
You think if
I were half Jewish,

1424
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,640
they'd let me halfway
in the pool?

1425
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:48,840
I'm really sorry.

1426
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:53,640
You didn't do anything.

1427
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:57,560
Who's Amy?

1428
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:04,160
She's my sister.

1429
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,640
What? I didn't know
you had a sister.

1430
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:12,320
I have a sister- Amy.

1431
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:15,040
She lives up north
in a special needs facility.

1432
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:16,960
- Was she in an accident?
- No, no.

1433
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,320
F.A.S. Do you know
what that is?

1434
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:21,240
Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.
Any other questions?

1435
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:22,640
I'm on your side, remember?

1436
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:26,040
I don't want anyone
on my side, remember?

1437
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:30,880
You thinkjust because we
fucked, that makes us "we"?

1438
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:33,400
I didn't ask for this,
for you. Sojust stop.

1439
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:36,000
You called me, remember?
So make up your fucking mind.

1440
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:39,680
How many ways do you need to be
told to leave me the fuck alone?

1441
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:42,480
You know what, asshole?
Just one.

1442
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:58,080
Alls I know is-

1443
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:01,920
all I know is if I wasn't
loaded half the time,

1444
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:03,680
I probably wouldn't be
in this mess.

1445
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:05,680
Don't you feel like
the older you get,

1446
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:07,200
the less you really
know about anything?

1447
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:09,600
Absolutely. I don't know shit.

1448
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:12,440
People thinkjust because
I managed to make it to 60

1449
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:14,640
without getting
a Colombian necklace

1450
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:16,440
or getting run over
by a UPS truck,

1451
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,760
that I have the answers
to life's questions.

1452
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:22,840
Great, so there's
no hope.

1453
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,080
Don't do that.

1454
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:25,760
I'm not that Deepak Chopra

1455
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,240
or whatever the hell
he calls himself.

1456
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:28,760
He tells you, if you believe
in yourself,

1457
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:31,280
you can do anything- pish!

1458
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:35,160
Alls I know is, you keep your
two eyes on your own paper

1459
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:37,160
and both hands on the wheel.

1460
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:39,080
And a multi-vitamin
can't hurt.

1461
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:43,480
So I guess the lesson's the same
with booze as it is with guys.

1462
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:47,200
Wanting it and having it...
totally not the same thing.

1463
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:50,200
I'll be right back.
The bathroom.

1464
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:02,600
Hey.

1465
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:06,680
Sometimes I think
you can want it and have it.

1466
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:11,240
And now what happens now?

1467
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,840
Now?

1468
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:15,800
You mean about Eli
being at the wedding?

1469
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:17,760
That's not what I meant.

1470
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:22,840
Wait, wait, wait.

1471
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:25,880
You made me wait too long.
Think too much about it.

1472
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,720
Told you... negative.

1473
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:28,880
Great.

1474
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:31,080
I guess that's it.

1475
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:34,160
It's nice meeting you.

1476
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:36,520
You'll be seeing a lot more
of me, you'll see.

1477
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:39,000
Now that I'm off relationships
and just doing one night stands.

1478
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:40,960
Yeah, sure.

1479
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,440
Take a condom.

1480
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:45,360
We used to put candy in this.

1481
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:48,000
Anyway, sorry I talked
your ear off.

1482
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:50,920
Please, it's better than
a fucking movie, sweetheart.

1483
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:54,920
Don't you need
a parking validation?

1484
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,520
Right, thank you.

1485
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:00,320
- ( phone ringing )
- Wait a second.

1486
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:02,320
Feedback Clinic,
this is Esther.

1487
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:06,680
Hi, honey, how you doing?

1488
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:09,840
What? Go ahead, ask me.

1489
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:14,800
I'm not a mind reader.

1490
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:17,520
You ever see me on the fucking
Psychic Friends Network channel?

1491
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,160
Would... would you just
shut up for a minute?

1492
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:24,080
So don't tell me.

1493
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:28,840
Trust me, Esther-
one night stands.

1494
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:32,480
It's all black and white
for you, isn't it?

1495
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:33,280
What?

1496
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:37,680
I have been married
to that putz for 42 years.

1497
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:41,200
The strongest, healthiest man
all his life.

1498
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:44,000
And all of a sudden,
he gets sick.

1499
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:46,560
Lung cancer.

1500
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:49,120
He never smoked a day
in his life.

1501
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:53,280
Pretty fucking ironic, isn't it?

1502
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:56,160
He's even got a someone taking
care of him in the afternoon.

1503
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:58,080
Just like a little boy.

1504
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:05,400
But he's dying, and if I stop
hawking him and giving him shit,

1505
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:09,400
calling him asshole,
he'll know he's dying.

1506
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:11,360
So I don't stop.

1507
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:15,480
Plus, he is an asshole,
so that's a bonus.

1508
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:21,960
So I've got my grandmother's
ring. That's old and borrowed.

1509
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,800
And Rachel got me
that blue thong.

1510
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,120
Hoochie floss.

1511
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:27,440
You got something else
that's new and blue?

1512
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:28,920
Actually, I do.

1513
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:32,840
Holy shit, Tom!
What happened?

1514
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:35,080
Bad date.

1515
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:37,600
What did you do,
pick him up on the street?

1516
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:39,200
Worse- AA.

1517
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:41,760
Apparently he uses sex
to work through anger,

1518
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:44,160
which is fine when you're
not quite that angry.

1519
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:47,880
What am I going to do with you?
Give me that.

1520
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:50,200
I smell a lecture.

1521
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:52,120
Fuck you, Tom.

1522
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:55,400
You blow off a great guy who,
by the way, doesn't hit

1523
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:57,960
because he made the tragic
mistake offalling for you.

1524
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,920
And instead you're doing
Ike and Tina Turner

1525
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:02,000
with some asshole from AA.

1526
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:04,120
At least he's not
at Williams Sonoma

1527
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:06,520
registering for our
commitment ceremony.

1528
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:10,600
You're right. You're right,
Eli is such a loser.

1529
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,520
I'm going home.

1530
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:30,080
Holy shit.

1531
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:34,880
- What's the matter?
- What? Nothing.

1532
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:37,280
Bullshit. Why aren't you
getting dressed?

1533
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:41,040
I'm nervous about seeing Tom
at the wedding, that's all.

1534
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:46,040
Only you could turn my wedding day
into the Eli Wyckoff show.

1535
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:48,800
I'm sorry. Believe me, nobody
can hate me as much as I do.

1536
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:52,560
Oh my God, you have
to change the fucking record.

1537
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:54,520
You have to stop.

1538
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:57,760
You cannot make this the be-all and
end-all of your entire life.

1539
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,040
I'm not.

1540
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:00,000
That's exactly
what you're doing.

1541
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:01,120
Let me tell you something.

1542
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:03,520
Love is going to come
up and whack you

1543
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:06,200
- in the head before you know it.
- I don't believe that.

1544
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:08,960
- That happened to me and Jackie.
- You were lucky.

1545
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,560
You're unbelievable.

1546
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:14,080
I was miserable before I met
her, and itjust happens.

1547
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,160
You're a fucking amazing guy.

1548
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:17,840
You don't have
to do this, don't-

1549
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:19,520
Please shut up.
You're a great guy.

1550
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:21,720
If I were into guys,

1551
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,000
we'd be in China right now
picking out a baby.

1552
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,880
Thank God I'm not, but...

1553
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:26,560
Kidding. You know
I love the gays.

1554
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:27,960
And we appreciate it.

1555
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,800
- Guys?
- Mitch?

1556
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:33,320
I don't know if it's just me,
but I love it.

1557
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:34,840
You like the tux?

1558
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:36,760
Loving it.

1559
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:39,080
Mitch, remember when we
discussed the Ritalin situation?

1560
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,760
Please put on your pants...

1561
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,880
or get a tan.

1562
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:51,280
Get doubles.
I want all of these.

1563
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:52,320
When my sister got married,

1564
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:54,400
the best pictures were
from the Instamatics.

1565
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:56,720
Your sister got married?

1566
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:57,440
Yes.

1567
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:59,960
Fuck, what is my problem?

1568
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,480
I'm like man poison.

1569
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:04,280
Fucking penis Raid.

1570
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:05,680
Whatever!

1571
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:08,120
Girls... how do I look?

1572
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:12,160
Oh my God, you look
like a movie star.

1573
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:13,120
Really?

1574
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:14,520
- Yes.
- Totally.

1575
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:15,360
Seriously.

1576
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:17,320
In a million years,

1577
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:19,800
I never thought I'd be
wearing white this soon.

1578
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:22,040
You shouldn't be, unless
you want me to call the Pope

1579
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:24,000
and tell him
it happened again.

1580
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,800
I would've worn the cream one,

1581
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:28,680
except it made me look like
a Jenny Craig "before" picture.

1582
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:31,000
Are you crazy?

1583
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:32,640
Where's Tom?

1584
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:35,440
He's on the patio.
He is a man, after all.

1585
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:38,360
Repellent. Gay or
straight, it doesn't matter.

1586
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:42,600
Put that out. You're killing
my unborn child.

1587
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,160
I was aiming a little higher.

1588
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:47,120
Nice. What are you
doing out here?

1589
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:55,160
Oh my God,
Eli was stalking you?

1590
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:57,600
That is so romantic.

1591
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:59,560
Not to me.

1592
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:03,040
That's right.
But if he tried to kill you,

1593
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:05,520
then you'd be picking out
china patterns.

1594
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:07,440
Are you all right?

1595
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:11,000
Yeah.

1596
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:14,240
You're getting married.
I'm having abandonment issues.

1597
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:15,920
I'm just extending
the family, babe.

1598
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:17,400
Woman: Jackie, let's go.

1599
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:19,360
We'll be right there.

1600
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:27,480
Tom, I owe you an apology.

1601
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:29,760
For what?

1602
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:32,800
The way I've been
pressuring you about Eli.

1603
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:34,720
And I realize that
I've just been trying

1604
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:37,560
to make you like everybody else
and you're not.

1605
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,480
And that's one of things
I love about you.

1606
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,320
You're the only guy I know

1607
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:44,680
who will probably never find
that one person

1608
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:46,800
to settle down with
and still be very happy.

1609
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:50,080
I envy that.

1610
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:53,200
Jackie, get your ass in here
or I'm wearing the veil.

1611
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:57,440
We're coming.

1612
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:00,080
But look at me. Shit!

1613
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:03,000
I'm like one step away
from den mother, PTA,

1614
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:05,200
and "Hi, Honey,
I'm home."

1615
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:06,880
How the fuck
did that happen?

1616
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:09,640
Guess you fell in love.

1617
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:10,960
What?

1618
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,400
No, I just got lipstick all over
every single one of my teeth.

1619
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:15,360
How did I do that?

1620
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:23,200
It's show time.

1621
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:25,120
You may exchange the rings.

1622
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:28,560
Wow, that's a nice one.

1623
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:38,680
Congratulations, I now pronounce
you man and wife.

1624
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:39,720
You may kiss the bride.

1625
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:41,600
( glass breaking )

1626
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:14,600
Eli.

1627
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:18,560
- Eli.
- Yeah?

1628
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:23,560
How long are we going to have
to keep ignoring each other?

1629
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:27,480
What? I'm not ignoring you.

1630
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:29,280
You ignoring me?

1631
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:31,320
Come on, Eli.

1632
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:33,440
You haven't returned
one of my phone calls.

1633
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:36,360
And you've said maybe three
words to me the entire day,

1634
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:37,800
two of which were
"seafood newburg."

1635
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:40,520
Which I have to say
was repulsive.

1636
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:44,840
Can I get some more Champagne?
Champagne?

1637
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,240
No, can I get a-

1638
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:47,320
That's right, I'm sorry.

1639
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:49,760
Absolut Martini, straight up,
two olives. Make it dirty.

1640
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:52,040
No, actually seltzer
with lime, please.

1641
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:57,440
So now you're not drinking?

1642
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:02,680
Wow.

1643
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:04,760
Good for you.

1644
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:06,720
Thanks.

1645
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:09,880
I sorta had to-
I was slipping in the polls.

1646
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:15,680
I, on the other hand,
need more Champagne.

1647
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:40,040
- I'm sorry I didn't-
- Let's not do any of that,

1648
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:43,400
"I'm sorry, it didn't work out"
post-mortem stuff, okay?

1649
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:47,320
Okay.

1650
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:49,840
Besides, it'll free up some time
to make fun of people.

1651
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:54,320
Like Mitch, the man of mystery,
teaching the rabbi the Macarena.

1652
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:56,120
What is this, 1987?

1653
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:58,720
Did you see Bret's mom?

1654
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:00,920
I've never seen a woman
with more hair on her back.

1655
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,720
I keep waiting
for the anti-fur activists

1656
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:04,240
to storm in here
and throw paint on her.

1657
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:07,880
Tom: Poor Brett and Jackie.

1658
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:09,720
They have no idea what they've
gotten themselves into.

1659
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:10,720
But they will, mark my words.

1660
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:14,080
First they'll only
hang out with other couples.

1661
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:16,000
Then they'll start doing
the "we" thing.

1662
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:18,760
"We love this,
and we hate that."

1663
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,320
And ordering
for each other,

1664
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:22,080
because that's what
"we" always have.

1665
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:23,640
Before you know it,

1666
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:25,640
she'll be shopping for lingerie
at Bloomingdales.

1667
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:27,040
And Brett,
the poor loser,

1668
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:28,120
will be outside
the dressing room

1669
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:30,080
with her pocketbook
in his lap.

1670
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:33,920
Oh my God.

1671
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:36,400
You are so full of shit,
you know that?

1672
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:39,520
You got this bullshit,
"I don't need anyone" thing.

1673
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:40,720
And you use that,

1674
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,640
thinking it's going to shield
you from the fact

1675
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:45,200
that your parents were drunks,
had a lousy marriage,

1676
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:46,960
and fucked up everyone
in their lives.

1677
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,640
But it's your life now,
not theirs.

1678
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:51,320
And what do you have
to show for it?

1679
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:54,160
You're just another self-hating
recovering alcoholic

1680
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:57,080
with nothing to live for
but a martini and a blowjob.

1681
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:05,360
Eli. Eli!

1682
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:06,400
Hey!

1683
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:08,600
( dishes crashing )

1684
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:11,600
Don't you dare sum me up.

1685
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:13,440
You don't know the first thing
about me.

1686
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:15,800
And that would be who's fault?

1687
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:18,760
God, it's so easy
for you, Mr.,

1688
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:21,120
love-is-a-many-splendored-thing.

1689
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:23,840
But you know what?
I've seen it. I've seen it.

1690
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:26,800
My parents loved one another.
Until death do us part.

1691
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:28,440
And believe me,
it practically came to that.

1692
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:31,040
Have you ever heard the sound

1693
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:35,560
of two people suffocating
one another? Have you?

1694
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:39,000
Or the sound of ice cubes
smashing against the wall?

1695
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:42,280
Or a pot roast being
shoved down the disposal? No!

1696
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:43,800
How could you possibly,

1697
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:47,360
with your touchy-feely "I'm
okay, you're okay" parents.

1698
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:52,360
I'm sorry I'm bursting
your little bubble.

1699
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:54,320
But there are
a million guys out there

1700
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:56,960
who can give you
what you want.

1701
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:58,880
I'm just not one of them.

1702
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:03,040
I'm sorry.

1703
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,960
You do the math.

1704
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:09,360
You know what?

1705
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:12,000
Fuck you if that's the wrong use
of that expression.

1706
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:29,640
- If could I bring you back -

1707
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:33,680
- That'd be the sweetest thing -

1708
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:37,320
- If I could bring you back -

1709
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:41,760
- I would do anything -

1710
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:45,680
- If I could bring you back... -

1711
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:50,560
- To me. -

1712
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:17,600
I just wanted to say,
before I go...

1713
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:21,600
I'm sorry.

1714
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:25,120
I don't want you
to leave here today

1715
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:28,280
thinking that you can't
do this-

1716
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:31,400
be in a...

1717
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:35,720
Because you can.

1718
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:38,640
Tom, you are going
to meet someone,

1719
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:43,440
and you're going to be
so great at this.

1720
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:47,520
It's not going to be
like your parents,

1721
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:51,760
and it's not going to be
like it was with me.

1722
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:58,560
Anyway, uh...

1723
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:04,000
I'll see you around.

1724
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:06,480
Eli...

1725
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:08,800
What?

1726
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:10,720
What exactly do you want?

1727
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:15,760
W-what do I...

1728
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:19,040
Yeah... you.

1729
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:26,160
I wanted this to stop
being so fucking hard.

1730
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:32,520
I want to meet your sister.

1731
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:37,880
I want to be over this part,

1732
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:42,440
so I can call you an asshole
even when you're sick,

1733
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:45,760
and you'd still know
how much I love you.

1734
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:46,760
Eli.

1735
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,360
I don't know
what you call that, Tom.

1736
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:51,640
Pocketbook holding,
suffocating... maybe.

1737
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:55,160
But if I could ever have
anything even close to that-

1738
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:57,080
Eli!

1739
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:24,320
I'm gonna go.

1740
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:27,800
Valet's got my car.

1741
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:32,080
There you are!

1742
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:33,560
- Eli, hey.
- Hey.

1743
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,760
Should I? Or is this...
is everything okay?

1744
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:38,560
Yeah, yeah.
What's up with the braid?

1745
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:41,720
Brett did it.
It's a long story.

1746
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:43,520
I need to take
a personal moment.

1747
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:44,480
What's the matter?
You're not having fun?

1748
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:46,360
I was until
about five minutes ago.

1749
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:48,560
What happened?

1750
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:50,400
I put my left foot in
I put my left foot out

1751
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:52,600
I put my left foot in
and then I threw up.

1752
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,040
The baby?

1753
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:57,560
No. Bret's cousin Al
bumped his pokey into my hokey

1754
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,120
and I borsched.

1755
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:01,320
I think Brett is the only
normal person in that family.

1756
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,840
Can we talk about
his brother Mitch?

1757
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:05,760
Hello, Freakie-McFreak.

1758
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,240
He wants tojoin
Cirque du Soleil.

1759
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:09,120
He says he can swallow
his own leg.

1760
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:12,480
What's up?

1761
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:14,040
How you doing?

1762
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:15,240
What am I missing?

1763
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:16,800
Just a family resemblance.

1764
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:17,960
And I love you for it.

1765
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,320
Okay. I don't know
what that means.

1766
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:21,640
I'm really smashed...

1767
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:24,240
I think I just made out
with the rabbi.

1768
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:25,200
He is hot.

1769
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:26,160
Is there dancing?

1770
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:27,160
Are we going to dance?

1771
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:30,280
Because I promised the family
some hot man-on-man action.

1772
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:32,160
- You and me?
- No...

1773
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:34,080
I think he means me and you.

1774
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:35,480
Come on guys, let's go.

1775
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:36,640
It's going to be fun.

1776
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:38,320
Come on, sweetheart.

1777
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:40,080
Bret: Look at that ass!

1778
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:41,520
A little something like that...

1779
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:51,600
Eli: I just had my hip replaced.

1780
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:53,480
How hot does this broad look?

1781
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:57,400
Tom: I finally saw
"Gone With The Wind."

1782
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,800
And?

1783
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:00,280
And, I loved it.

1784
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:01,800
Oh, thank God.

1785
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:04,000
I think Scarlett realizes
in the end

1786
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:06,200
that it was just fear
holding her back from the guy

1787
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:08,480
that she wanted to...
you know.

1788
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:09,480
Eli: Hold her pocket book?

1789
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,560
Yeah.

1790
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:13,920
And I think
about Rhett Butler.

1791
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:15,360
Yeah?

1792
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:18,040
He wasn't very fuzzy.
Was he?

1793
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:21,680
( theme music )
- I'm gonna make you love me -

1794
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:25,440
- I'm gonna dry your tears -

1795
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:27,840
- We're gonna stay together -

1796
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:29,280
- For a million years -

1797
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:41,720
- It's the least I can do -

1798
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:45,600
- Just to make you my baby, -

1799
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:49,520
- No words can describe -

1800
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:53,280
- Ah, pinch me I'm dreamin' -

1801
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:56,160
- Your hair's long and black -

1802
01:28:56,160 --> 01:29:00,880
- As it lays cross my pillow -

1803
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:03,680
- When I stare in your eyes -

1804
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:07,880
- I get lost in your glory -

1805
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:11,320
- I'll never be -

1806
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:13,600
- All you want me to -

1807
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:15,120
- But that's all right, -

1808
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:22,160
- I'm gonna make you love me -

1809
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:25,920
- I'm gonna dry your tears, -

1810
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:28,400
- We're gonna stay together -

1811
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:29,600
- For a million... -

1812
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:33,440
- I'm gonna make you love me -

1813
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:37,200
- I'm gonna dry your tears, -

1814
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:39,640
- We're gonna stay together -

1815
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:42,040
- For a million years. -

1816
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:02,920
- If the silence
doesn't kill it, -

1817
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:05,040
- Then illusion will -

1818
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:12,440
- And you're staring
at the sky, -

1819
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:15,480
- But the moon ain't
gonna pay our bills -

1820
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:22,560
- And we're laughin'
'bout it loud, -

1821
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:25,440
- When, oh, you know
it ain't nojoke -

1822
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:33,600
- You see them kick the rose
with glitter, -

1823
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,800
- Trade your dreams for smoke -

1824
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:44,040
- Tear drops in the tree tops, -

1825
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:46,760
- The wind is whistling
through the mountain's teeth -

1826
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:56,800
- A soul for every wounded dove -

1827
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:08,360
- We're out further
than the rainbow's edge -
