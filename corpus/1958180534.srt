These last few years,
Christmas seems like another

27
00:01:42,171 --> 00:01:46,313
sugar coated to do on
my already bloated list.

28
00:01:46,347 --> 00:01:49,626
Women everywhere are expected
to conjure their inner Marthas

29
00:01:49,661 --> 00:01:51,594
and do it all.

30

Give it to me.

You have got to see my new

It's, Soph I really think

think that Nikki needs braces

00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:21,546
and my transmission's shot.

63
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,238

own firm has always seemed

66
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:29,209
kind of speculative to you,

67
00:03:29,243 --> 00:03:31,728
but look I'm a good architect.

68
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,558

everything under control David.

Anna just stop for a
second please, thank you.

91
00:04:14,978 --> 00:04:16,497
- Can we see Santa after school?

92
00:04:16,532 --> 00:04:17,843
- We're busy later right Mom?

93
00:04:17,878 --> 00:04:19,224
- Oh yeah I'm busy.

94
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,467
After lunch I have a staff

I have the contracts at two.

I have a deposition at four

97
00:04:23,711 --> 00:04:25,506
and I sure hope that Bob
doesn't expect me

98
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,232
to work late tonight again.

99
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,647

Get ready.

103
00:04:33,859 --> 00:04:35,413
- Why does no one ever listen
to me?

104
00:04:35,447 --> 00:04:36,759
- I can sing for him.

105
00:04:36,793 --> 00:04:39,140
Jingle bell jingle
bell jingle all the way

106
00:04:39,175 --> 00:04:40,107
- Please Anna anything but that
song.

107
00:04:40,141 --> 00:04:43,213
Anything, I can't bear to hear
it again.

108
00:04:43,248 --> 00:04:44,422
Okay.

109
00:04:44,456 --> 00:04:46,320
- I decided I want a puppy from
Santa.

110
00:04:46,355 --> 00:04:48,011
Do you think he'll get me a
puppy?

111
00:04:48,046 --> 00:04:49,668
- Mom, hello?

112
00:04:49,703 --> 00:04:54,397

of my eye, gem of my life.

- Sophie Kelly are you avoiding
me?

125
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,359
- Hey neighbor, no of course
not.

126
00:05:25,394 --> 00:05:27,741
- Did you bring your
cookies for the bake sale?

127
00:05:27,775 --> 00:05:29,363
- They're cooling on the rack.

128
00:05:29,398 --> 00:05:31,434
- It's just awesome of you to
volunteer.

129
00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:35,404
I don't know how you do
it, you Superwoman you.

133
00:05:44,827 --> 00:05:47,795
- So your Mom really forgot
about the Christmas play today?

134
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,039
- Yeah I even put my
makeup on to remind her.

135
00:05:50,073 --> 00:05:51,178
- And what'd she say?

136
00:05:51,212 --> 00:05:54,284
- She called me a hooker
and then made my Dad upset.

137
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:55,872
- Whoa.

138
00:05:55,907 --> 00:05:57,253

[ominous music]

140
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:05,399
- They man's a donkey who
says it's my own fault

141
00:06:05,434 --> 00:06:07,539
I signed a contract with no
benefits.

142
00:06:07,574 --> 00:06:09,610
I hope this baby knows how to
file.

143
00:06:09,645 --> 00:06:10,439
- You alright Claire?

144
00:06:10,473 --> 00:06:11,578
- Do I look like a whale?

145
00:06:11,612 --> 00:06:12,406
- No.

146
00:06:12,441 --> 00:06:13,269

Bob is choking on his All Bran.

151
00:06:21,933 --> 00:06:23,521
Gosh did I miss the Lasky
meeting?

152
00:06:23,555 --> 00:06:24,625
- They were early.

153
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,937
I swear that woman gets
up at five in the morning

154
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:28,146
just to sharpen her horns.

155
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,699
Here they come.

156
00:06:29,734 --> 00:06:32,219
- Mark, rest assured this firm--

157
00:06:32,253 --> 00:06:33,116
- Quick, duck!

158
00:06:33,151 --> 00:06:37,327
- Will be at your back and call
24 / 7.

159
00:06:44,956 --> 00:06:47,510
- That man is vile, vile!

160
00:06:47,545 --> 00:06:51,652
- Okay look, I need you
to print me up a new copy

161
00:06:52,515 --> 00:06:55,449
of this contract and send
some cookies to school

162
00:06:55,484 --> 00:06:57,831
and rough them up a bit so they
look like they're home made.

163
00:06:57,865 --> 00:06:59,488
You're an angel, thank you.

164
00:06:59,522 --> 00:07:01,144
- You're my goddess.

165
00:07:01,179 --> 00:07:04,078
Which is why it is with
deep regret that I have to

166
00:07:04,113 --> 00:07:05,321
give you the latest.

167
00:07:05,355 --> 00:07:06,702
- What do you mean you're
going to give the Lasky account

168
00:07:06,736 --> 00:07:07,737
to Chuck?

169
00:07:07,772 --> 00:07:11,016
My work on this file has been
spotless.

170
00:07:11,948 --> 00:07:13,778
Figuratively speaking.

171
00:07:14,986 --> 00:07:19,162
- So when I climbed Everest
last year I had the best guide

172
00:07:20,301 --> 00:07:21,130
in Nepal.

173
00:07:22,511 --> 00:07:26,687
Got caught on the peak, ice
storm, 40 below, lost my pick.

174
00:07:28,206 --> 00:07:29,863
Sherpa saved my ass.

175
00:07:31,554 --> 00:07:35,558
- That's a beautiful story
Bob, what's your point.

176
00:07:35,593 --> 00:07:37,802
- You leave work early
several times a week.

177
00:07:37,836 --> 00:07:39,976
- Yeah well things have
been a little hectic lately.

178
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:42,462
- Well there's a major
property deal for the firm.

179
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:44,222
I just don't know if you're
the right person to be

180
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:46,327
up on that mountain right now.

181
00:07:46,362 --> 00:07:47,605
- Excuse me?

182
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:50,642
- Well ever since you came
back from your last kid,

183
00:07:50,677 --> 00:07:54,266
and believe me motherhood
is the most important job

184
00:07:54,301 --> 00:07:55,923
in the world.

185
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:59,409
I just think you may have lost
your edge.

186
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,103
- Lost my edge?

187
00:08:03,137 --> 00:08:03,966
I'm edgy.

188
00:08:05,346 --> 00:08:06,175
No edge.

189
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:08,453
- We're making that push for
the top.

190
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,904
You gotta be able to
depend on your whole team

191
00:08:10,938 --> 00:08:12,043
to get you there.

192
00:08:12,077 --> 00:08:13,044
- I'm here for you Bob.

193
00:08:13,078 --> 00:08:13,976
Look at me.

194
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,843
Okay I might have a run in my
stockings

195
00:08:18,877 --> 00:08:20,085
but I am here for you.

196
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,949
- Oh come on, when push comes
to shove

197
00:08:21,984 --> 00:08:23,537
what's it going to be?

198
00:08:23,572 --> 00:08:27,714
24 / 7 with the Laskys or
little Angela's got pneumonia.

199
00:08:29,647 --> 00:08:33,823
- Her name is Annie and she
refuses to put on warm socks.

200
00:08:35,066 --> 00:08:38,207
- Not all Mommies can
reach the peak Sophie.

201
00:08:38,241 --> 00:08:40,140
- Or the corner office.

202
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:43,764
- Sophie, Sophie, Sophie.

203
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:48,217
Come on, time is money.

204
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:58,434
[knocking]

205
00:08:58,468 --> 00:08:59,987
- Come in.

206
00:09:00,022 --> 00:09:01,506
- Hey sis.

207
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,369
- Hi.

208
00:09:04,371 --> 00:09:05,786
Do you ever call first?

209
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:07,961
- More spontaneous this way.

210
00:09:07,995 --> 00:09:10,826
So did we ever decide what
we were going to get Mom yet?

211
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,587
- We were supposed to get
her something last week.

212
00:09:13,622 --> 00:09:15,037
- Is this some sort of passive
aggressive

213
00:09:15,071 --> 00:09:16,348
sibling order thing?

214
00:09:16,383 --> 00:09:18,592
- No, no, no, I'll get
her something tonight.

215
00:09:18,627 --> 00:09:19,662
I've got to go to the mall.

216
00:09:19,697 --> 00:09:20,594
- No, tonight you're
putting on a pretty dress

217
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:22,769
and making nice with the
clients.

218
00:09:22,803 --> 00:09:24,736
- My god the office party.

219
00:09:24,771 --> 00:09:25,875
- Any single men for me?

220
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:26,980
- No.

221
00:09:27,014 --> 00:09:28,947
- Just for that I'm going
to bring the mashed yams

222
00:09:28,982 --> 00:09:31,881
with the little colored
marshmallows for Christmas
dinner.

223
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,919
- Oh I forgot I was going to
host that.

224
00:09:34,953 --> 00:09:36,645
I volunteered.

225
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:38,854
- After she got drunk
drinking two shots of tequila

226
00:09:38,888 --> 00:09:40,752
at Mom and Dad's anniversary
party.

227
00:09:40,787 --> 00:09:42,512
- Not a good day.

228
00:09:42,547 --> 00:09:43,341
- See ya.

229
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,376
- Bye honey.

230
00:09:46,724 --> 00:09:49,416
[sighing]

231
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,935
[metal clanking]

232
00:09:50,969 --> 00:09:53,558
- The chair, I know, I'm on it.

233
00:09:55,905 --> 00:09:57,217
- [Announcer] Attention holiday
shoppers,

234
00:09:57,251 --> 00:09:59,046
there's only four days
left 'til Christmas.

235
00:09:59,081 --> 00:10:01,324
Be sure to stop by our
Santa's Village to get your

236
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:02,774
photo with Santa.

237
00:10:05,087 --> 00:10:07,537
[upbeat Christmas music]

238
00:10:07,572 --> 00:10:09,125
- [Sophie] Oh baby please.

239
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,575
- [Child] I'm going
first, I'm going first.

240
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,403
- [Sophie] It's going to be
great.

241
00:10:11,438 --> 00:10:12,612
Everything's going to be fine.

242
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:15,718
Would you guys stop arguing,
please.

243
00:10:15,753 --> 00:10:18,134
Santa's going to hear you.

244
00:10:18,169 --> 00:10:22,276
Okay just stand quietly
you're almost there.

245
00:10:22,311 --> 00:10:23,588
- [Child] No I'm the one going
first.

246
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,038
Mom said I could.

247
00:10:25,072 --> 00:10:25,970
- Hey Dave?

248
00:10:28,455 --> 00:10:29,283
Dave?

249
00:10:30,146 --> 00:10:32,010
Pick up the phone.

250
00:10:32,045 --> 00:10:35,531
My battery's dying Dave,
please pick up the phone.

251
00:10:35,565 --> 00:10:36,808
I'm at the mall.

252
00:10:36,843 --> 00:10:40,191
I'm trying to get a dress and
I need you to take care of--

253
00:10:40,225 --> 00:10:41,537
[squealing]

254
00:10:41,571 --> 00:10:45,714
The kids because I have
this office party tonight.

255
00:10:46,715 --> 00:10:48,302
Pick up the phone.

256
00:10:48,337 --> 00:10:49,821
Honey!

257
00:10:49,856 --> 00:10:52,099
[growling]

258
00:10:53,825 --> 00:10:54,654
- Sophie?

259
00:10:56,241 --> 00:10:57,898
- Marcia Wade.

260
00:10:57,933 --> 00:10:59,693
- Oh my gosh.

261
00:10:59,728 --> 00:11:01,143
What's it been 15 years?

262
00:11:01,177 --> 00:11:04,974
- You look the same if that's
possible.

263
00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:07,011
- Well you look healthy.

264
00:11:10,255 --> 00:11:11,705
Tell me this isn't yours.

265
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,880
- Yeah he looks just like Dave.

266
00:11:13,914 --> 00:11:15,088
My other two are other there.

267
00:11:15,122 --> 00:11:16,537
- Mom, Mom!

268
00:11:16,572 --> 00:11:17,987
- Get your rat nest hairdo out
of my face!

269
00:11:18,022 --> 00:11:18,850
- Mom!

270
00:11:20,783 --> 00:11:23,406
- Kids, you ever think about
them?

271
00:11:23,441 --> 00:11:24,649
- Well let's just say the men I
date,

272
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,238
we're not spending a lot of
time thinking about babies.

273
00:11:27,272 --> 00:11:29,102
[laughing]

274
00:11:29,136 --> 00:11:31,000
I can't believe you and
Dave are still together.

275
00:11:31,035 --> 00:11:32,381
- Yeah.

276
00:11:32,415 --> 00:11:34,728
- God we used to have
so much fun in school.

277
00:11:34,763 --> 00:11:36,316
- [Sophie] I know.

278
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,973
- You know, we should
get together for a drink.

279
00:11:38,007 --> 00:11:38,974
Catch up properly.

280
00:11:39,008 --> 00:11:40,803
- Yeah, you still at Coltrane
and Brock?

281
00:11:40,838 --> 00:11:42,529
- It's Wade, Coltrane and Brock.

282
00:11:42,563 --> 00:11:44,117
I took the whole thing over.

283
00:11:44,151 --> 00:11:44,945
[baby screaming and crying]

284
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,533
- Oh well.

285
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:47,810
- You'd better call.

286
00:11:47,845 --> 00:11:49,432
Martinis.

287
00:11:49,467 --> 00:11:51,434
- Not gonna happen.

288
00:11:51,469 --> 00:11:52,297
Here's your binky.

289
00:11:52,332 --> 00:11:53,782
Nikki, please.

290
00:11:53,816 --> 00:11:55,715
[baby crying]

291
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:57,682
Oh that's good.

292
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,960
Honey, it's time to see Santa.

293
00:11:59,995 --> 00:12:01,755
- He looks weird.

294
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:04,171
- Uh well, no honey, come on.

295
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:06,933
Over here.

296
00:12:06,967 --> 00:12:09,176
Santa is your friend.

297
00:12:09,211 --> 00:12:11,696
Don't you want to tell
Santa your special wish?

298
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:12,904
- Uh uh.

299
00:12:12,939 --> 00:12:13,767
- No?

300
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:16,390
Do you mind?

301
00:12:17,357 --> 00:12:18,151
- [Santa] Come on.

302
00:12:18,185 --> 00:12:20,394
- He doesn't bite, okay honey?

303
00:12:20,429 --> 00:12:22,189
See it's okay.

304
00:12:22,224 --> 00:12:23,570
- [Santa] Smile.

305
00:12:24,951 --> 00:12:26,642
[shutter clicking]

306
00:12:26,676 --> 00:12:30,542
And what does Mommy want for
Christmas.

307
00:12:30,577 --> 00:12:31,474
- Her life.

308
00:12:33,028 --> 00:12:35,962
[melancholy music]

309
00:12:39,897 --> 00:12:42,762
[twinkling music]

310
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:44,798
It's your turn now.

311
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:45,626
Come on.

312
00:12:45,661 --> 00:12:47,421
- [Santa] You must be Anna, huh?

313
00:12:47,456 --> 00:12:48,284
Come here.

314
00:12:50,597 --> 00:12:52,392
So what do you want for
Christmas.

315
00:12:52,426 --> 00:12:53,462
- A puppy.

316
00:12:53,496 --> 00:12:54,808
- [Santa] A puppy?

317
00:12:54,843 --> 00:12:56,396
What kind of puppy?

318
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:58,260
- [Anna] A little snowball
puppy.

319
00:12:58,294 --> 00:12:59,502
- [Santa] Snowball puppy?

320
00:12:59,537 --> 00:13:00,331
- [Anna] Like that.

321
00:13:00,365 --> 00:13:01,573
- [Santa] Okay.

322
00:13:01,608 --> 00:13:03,506
Thanks a lot kid, Merry
Christmas.

323
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,646
- [Anna] Merry Christmas.

324
00:13:09,409 --> 00:13:13,827
- Okay um, I've got 10
minutes to drive home

325
00:13:13,862 --> 00:13:16,554
and then three minutes to shower

326
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:17,727
and then try on this dress.

327
00:13:17,762 --> 00:13:19,557
Oh my gosh I hope this dress
fits.

328
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:20,489
I really do.

329
00:13:20,523 --> 00:13:23,630
Hey watch that, it's kinda hot
okay?

330
00:13:23,664 --> 00:13:26,806
- You know Santa said
I could have a puppy.

331
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,982
- You know Santa sometimes
brings other things.

332
00:13:31,017 --> 00:13:32,087
Come here.

333
00:13:32,121 --> 00:13:33,053
Santa brings other things

334
00:13:33,088 --> 00:13:34,261
that you might not have asked
for okay?

335
00:13:34,296 --> 00:13:35,573
- Maybe I should have asked for
a Mom

336
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:36,608
who cares about my life.

337
00:13:36,643 --> 00:13:38,058
- You know you promised

338
00:13:38,093 --> 00:13:39,508
that if I bought you some hot
chocolate

339
00:13:39,542 --> 00:13:42,166
you'd stop complaining
for five minutes, alright?

340
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:42,994
- How can I?

341
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:44,306
This is the worst day ever.

342
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,134
- Agreed.

343
00:13:45,169 --> 00:13:47,585
Keys, keys, where are my keys?

344
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:51,451
Oh god of randomly missing
things don't do this to me now.

345
00:13:51,485 --> 00:13:52,935
[keys jingling]

346
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,661
Honey give me the keys.

347
00:13:54,695 --> 00:13:56,007
Anna, stop it.

348
00:13:56,042 --> 00:13:58,044
Just give me the keys.

349
00:13:58,078 --> 00:13:59,148
[keys jingling]

350
00:13:59,183 --> 00:14:00,943
Anna, stop it.

351
00:14:00,978 --> 00:14:02,772
Anna please.

352
00:14:02,807 --> 00:14:04,982
- Mom this is so boring
can we please just go?

353
00:14:05,016 --> 00:14:07,812
- I know, look, I would send
you to Venus

354
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,607
and leave you there if I could,
alright?

355
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:12,230
Anna what are you doing
with the hot chocolate?

356
00:14:12,265 --> 00:14:13,680
Stop that!

357
00:14:13,714 --> 00:14:15,026
[gasping]

358
00:14:15,061 --> 00:14:16,165
My new dress!

359
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,167
Oh my gosh.

360
00:14:21,377 --> 00:14:23,207
How could you do that?

361
00:14:24,622 --> 00:14:27,280
How am I ever going to
get a dress that fits now.

362
00:14:27,314 --> 00:14:28,212

00:25:20,967 --> 00:25:21,796
- Morris?

547
00:25:22,693 --> 00:25:23,832
You know me?

548
00:25:23,867 --> 00:25:25,144
- Unfortunately.

549
00:25:25,178 --> 00:25:26,559
Are you on your way.

550
00:25:26,594 --> 00:25:28,561
- Alright I'll be there.

551
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:30,598
Soon.

552
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,774
[groaning]

553
00:25:37,915 --> 00:25:41,091
Alright let's see what I have
to wear.

554
00:25:47,131 --> 00:25:50,065
Look at this closet, it's all
in order.

555
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,274
[gasping]

556
00:25:53,586 --> 00:25:54,414
Oh soft.

557
00:25:58,211 --> 00:25:59,040
Wow.

558
00:26:00,628 --> 00:26:02,215
These are all mine.

559
00:26:06,185 --> 00:26:08,808
Whoever said a Kelly bag
doesn't make a woman feel

560
00:26:08,843 --> 00:26:10,465
powerful was lying.

561
00:26:14,158 --> 00:26:16,816
[ominous music]

562
00:26:19,647 --> 00:26:22,581
[phone ringing]

563
00:26:22,615 --> 00:26:23,651
Hi Claire.

564
00:26:23,685 --> 00:26:24,686
- You know my name?

565
00:26:24,721 --> 00:26:26,205
- Yeah.

566
00:26:26,239 --> 00:26:27,033
- She's been pissy since you
refused

567
00:26:27,068 --> 00:26:29,277
to give her maternity leave.

568
00:26:29,311 --> 00:26:30,865
- You look great Morris.

569
00:26:30,899 --> 00:26:32,901
- No, I will not work on
Christmas Day.

570
00:26:32,936 --> 00:26:34,972
Did you get my message about
the client party on Thursday?

571
00:26:35,007 --> 00:26:37,492
Oh and the travel agent called
about Aspen

572
00:26:37,526 --> 00:26:39,494
and Bob is late again.

573
00:26:39,528 --> 00:26:40,633
- Yeah well he is the boss.

574
00:26:40,668 --> 00:26:42,773
- Yeah in his sad little
Italian loafer dreams

575
00:26:42,808 --> 00:26:44,050
he has your job.

576
00:26:44,085 --> 00:26:45,845
[gasping]

577
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,917
- Not all Mommies can reach the
peak.

578
00:26:48,952 --> 00:26:49,780
But I can.

579
00:26:50,885 --> 00:26:54,233
I have waited my entire career
for this.

580
00:26:56,718 --> 00:26:58,133
- I get it.

581
00:26:58,168 --> 00:26:59,790
Late night again last night
with your Tony Robbins

582
00:26:59,825 --> 00:27:01,274
motivational tapes?

583
00:27:01,309 --> 00:27:04,036
- Don't you have something to
do?

584
00:27:05,589 --> 00:27:08,592
I'm kidding Morris, I'm kidding.

585
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,525
[weak laughter]

586
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:11,353
- I know.

587
00:27:15,944 --> 00:27:17,566
- This is the life.

588
00:27:22,192 --> 00:27:23,020
Bob?

589
00:27:24,297 --> 00:27:25,126
Bob!

590
00:27:27,404 --> 00:27:30,407
- Sorry I'm late my kid has the
flu.

591
00:27:31,995 --> 00:27:33,652
- Oh my gosh really?

592
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:36,068
- No.

593
00:27:36,931 --> 00:27:38,346
- A lawyer lying.

594
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:40,451
Bob, Bob, Bob.

595
00:27:41,729 --> 00:27:42,902
Time is money.

596
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:52,153
- The Laskys are in the
conference room.

597
00:27:52,187 --> 00:27:55,846
I think we've kept them
waiting long enough.

598
00:28:03,198 --> 00:28:03,992
- Jake.

599
00:28:05,787 --> 00:28:07,168
- Good morning.

600
00:28:07,202 --> 00:28:08,134
- Margaret.

601
00:28:09,895 --> 00:28:13,622
Okay Ms. Lasky, singing the
land transfer agreements.

602
00:28:13,657 --> 00:28:14,658
Here you go.

603
00:28:15,901 --> 00:28:20,008
- This land has been in the
Lasky family for generations.

604
00:28:20,043 --> 00:28:23,563
Developed properly it could be
our legacy.

605
00:28:24,564 --> 00:28:26,670
- Well I can assure you that
this is my

606
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,776
utmost priority right now

607
00:28:29,673 --> 00:28:31,502
and that this is my...

608
00:28:35,748 --> 00:28:38,199
And like I was saying I can
assure you--

609
00:28:38,233 --> 00:28:39,372
- Do you find this amusing?

610
00:28:39,407 --> 00:28:42,582
- Actually not and if you look
at this

611
00:28:44,619 --> 00:28:46,932
you can tell that this is my
priority

612
00:28:46,966 --> 00:28:49,831
and I'm on this job 24 / 7.

613
00:28:49,866 --> 00:28:50,798
- Me too.

614
00:28:50,832 --> 00:28:52,178
- Let's hope so.

615
00:28:54,594 --> 00:28:58,737
- Alright well can you open
up and look on page one.

616
00:29:02,706 --> 00:29:04,121
You're absolutely right
about those changes,

617
00:29:04,156 --> 00:29:08,919
I will make them and I'm
sure you'll be very happy.

618
00:29:08,954 --> 00:29:10,852
- I will see you later.

619
00:29:20,344 --> 00:29:21,932
- Hypothetically speaking

620
00:29:21,967 --> 00:29:24,555
under the table in some
weird alternate universe

621
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:26,212
count as cheating on my husband

622
00:29:26,247 --> 00:29:29,043
who quite possibly doesn't
even know we're married

623
00:29:29,077 --> 00:29:32,667
and might actually not even
exist?

624
00:29:32,701 --> 00:29:33,772
- Come again?

625
00:29:35,256 --> 00:29:37,120
- What's going on with Jake
Lasky and me?

626
00:29:37,154 --> 00:29:38,466
- You mean Jake Lasky the
most eligible bachelor

627
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,363
in the city?

628
00:29:39,398 --> 00:29:40,226
- Yes.

629
00:29:41,193 --> 00:29:43,022
- He's been after you for weeks.

630
00:29:43,057 --> 00:29:45,231
- After me as in after me?

631
00:29:48,027 --> 00:29:50,616
- Let's just say this land
transfer isn't the only deal

632
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:53,619
he's planning on sealing this
Christmas.

633
00:29:53,653 --> 00:29:55,138
Way to score boss.

634
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:08,220
- Hey!

635
00:30:09,221 --> 00:30:10,049
Hey you!

636
00:30:11,257 --> 00:30:13,018
Weird Santa guy, hey!

637

[melancholy Christmas music]

639
00:30:23,891 --> 00:30:25,099
I need therapy.

640
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:28,827
A little retail therapy.

641
00:30:30,069 --> 00:30:33,486
[upbeat Christmas music]

642
00:30:37,318 --> 00:30:39,803
- Sophie, we've got that Tory
Burch trench

643
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:40,631
you were asking about.

644
00:30:40,666 --> 00:30:41,563
- Oh socks!

645
00:30:45,429 --> 00:30:47,190
- I heard she's seeing Jake
Lasky.

646
00:30:47,224 --> 00:30:50,469
What I wouldn't give for that
life.

647
00:30:50,503 --> 00:30:51,332
Come on.

648
00:30:52,574 --> 00:30:54,680
[sighing]

649
00:30:54,714 --> 00:30:55,957
- Wow.

650
00:30:55,992 --> 00:30:57,959
You come here twice a week?

651
00:30:57,994 --> 00:30:59,133
[laughing]

652
00:30:59,167 --> 00:31:00,617
That's fantastic.

653
00:31:02,101 --> 00:31:04,724
Ah there goes 10 years of
stress.

654
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:06,692
[phone ringing]

655
00:31:06,726 --> 00:31:08,832
Oh can you get that, I...

656
00:31:10,385 --> 00:31:11,421
Thank you.

657
00:31:11,455 --> 00:31:12,491
Hello?

658
00:31:12,525 --> 00:31:13,423
- Where are you?

659
00:31:13,457 --> 00:31:15,908
- I'm right where I belong.

[imitates buzzer buzzing]

661
00:31:17,116 --> 00:31:19,049
- You're late for the
Christmas wish charity concert.

662
00:31:19,084 --> 00:31:20,361
- No can do.

663
00:31:20,395 --> 00:31:22,294
I have a date with a memory
foam mattress

664
00:31:22,328 --> 00:31:24,123
after my nails dry.

665
00:31:24,158 --> 00:31:25,331
- Sting is hosting.

666
00:31:25,366 --> 00:31:26,194
- What?

667
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:28,507
Sting?

668
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:31,682
Oh my god Sting, I love
Sting, I love Sting.

669
00:31:31,717 --> 00:31:32,960
What am I going to wear?

670
00:31:32,994 --> 00:31:34,271
I can't go alone.

671
00:31:34,306 --> 00:31:35,445
Do you want to come with me?

672
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:37,205
- No I have to meet my trainer.

673
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,413
What about Jake.

674
00:31:38,448 --> 00:31:40,933
- Oh no I can't deal
with Mr. Freaky Footsie.

675
00:31:40,968 --> 00:31:42,279
Not tonight.

676
00:31:42,314 --> 00:31:43,763
What about Marcia Wade.

677
00:31:43,798 --> 00:31:45,420
She said she wanted to go for a
drink.

678
00:31:45,455 --> 00:31:47,422
- After you bankrupted her firm
last year?

679
00:31:47,457 --> 00:31:48,354
- What?

680
00:31:48,389 --> 00:31:50,184
Collateral damage after our
expansion.

681
00:31:50,218 --> 00:31:51,840
It was magnificent.

682
00:31:52,772 --> 00:31:55,154
- Oh I'm a slut and a tyrant.

683
00:31:56,707 --> 00:31:58,468
Did you have any luck
with that list of Santas

684
00:31:58,502 --> 00:32:00,435
from the Bay Ridge Mall?

685
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:03,197
- They referred me to
head office in Jersey.

686
00:32:03,231 --> 00:32:05,130
- Oh, well keep trying.

687
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:09,306
- [Morris On The Phone] Yeah
I'm not even going to ask.

688
00:32:09,341 --> 00:32:10,963
- Jill, it's me Sophie.

689
00:32:10,998 --> 00:32:11,999
Your sister.

690
00:32:12,033 --> 00:32:13,552
Do you like Sting?

691
00:32:14,415 --> 00:32:15,795
Jill look at these shoes.

692
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:16,796
Aren't they crazy?

693
00:32:16,831 --> 00:32:18,350
Look how high they are, it's
insane.

694
00:32:18,384 --> 00:32:22,147
And this bag, it's got
this weird horn on it.

695
00:32:23,044 --> 00:32:24,011
I bet it's really expensive.

696
00:32:24,045 --> 00:32:25,081
I wanted to show you these.

697
00:32:25,115 --> 00:32:26,806
Look, real diamonds.

698
00:32:28,912 --> 00:32:30,534
- You're festive.

699
00:32:30,569 --> 00:32:33,503
- Yeah I know well it's not
every night I get to go out

700
00:32:33,537 --> 00:32:35,677
partying with my little
sis in a limo to see Sting,

701
00:32:35,712 --> 00:32:37,093
come on.

702
00:32:37,127 --> 00:32:38,853
- You have to admit it's a
little weird.

703
00:32:38,887 --> 00:32:40,959
I mean all of a sudden
you're leaving messages

704
00:32:40,993 --> 00:32:42,374
and insisting we go out.

705
00:32:42,408 --> 00:32:46,585
- Yeah but we talk five
times a day, I mean come on.

706
00:32:47,827 --> 00:32:51,486
Or maybe I think about
you five times a day.

707
00:32:51,521 --> 00:32:53,143
Forgot to call?

708
00:32:53,178 --> 00:32:54,248
- For a year?

709
00:32:54,282 --> 00:32:55,111
- Oh god.

710
00:32:57,941 --> 00:33:01,186
- I can understand that you
don't have enough time for me

711
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,084
but Mom and Dad?

712
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:04,154
- What?

713
00:33:04,189 --> 00:33:05,466
What is wrong with Mom and Dad?

714
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:09,677
- Sophie, you missed their
50th anniversary party.

715
00:33:11,334 --> 00:33:13,819
- Yeah well I probably
had some important--

716
00:33:13,853 --> 00:33:16,063
- You don't need to make
excuses.

717
00:33:16,097 --> 00:33:18,651
You know what Mom ad Dad are
like.

718
00:33:18,686 --> 00:33:19,859
They're proud.

719
00:33:22,897 --> 00:33:24,588
Your career took front seat

720
00:33:24,623 --> 00:33:27,798
and they just learned to live
with it.

721
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,906
[melancholy music]

722
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:36,704
[crowd chattering]

723
00:33:39,431 --> 00:33:42,054
- You know Jill, I'd really
like to apologize for all the

724
00:33:42,089 --> 00:33:44,505
terrible things I've done,
but I really can't remember

725
00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:46,576
what they are, so.

726
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:50,787
Look all I can say is I'm going
to make it up to you, okay?

727
00:33:55,102 --> 00:33:58,139
Oh champagne, you want some?

728
00:33:58,174 --> 00:33:59,002
No?

729
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,798
Come on honey let's have some
fun.

730
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:03,317
[gasping]

731
00:34:03,351 --> 00:34:04,145
Look at this art.

732
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,285
Dave would love this.

733
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,597
- Dave?

734
00:34:07,631 --> 00:34:09,219
Dave Kelly?

735
00:34:09,254 --> 00:34:10,600
- Yeah.

736
00:34:10,634 --> 00:34:13,258
- I haven't thought about him
in years.

737
00:34:13,292 --> 00:34:15,501
Wonder what happened to him.

738
00:34:15,536 --> 00:34:17,193
- Yeah I wonder too.

739
00:34:18,504 --> 00:34:21,024
- Do you ever imagine what
your life would have been like

740
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,130
if you hadn't dumped him?

741
00:34:24,096 --> 00:34:26,305
- Yeah lately a lot.

742
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,618
- He's just such a great guy.

743
00:34:28,652 --> 00:34:30,309
- He is but sometimes--

744
00:34:30,344 --> 00:34:31,448
- Are you kidding?

745
00:34:31,483 --> 00:34:34,969
Me and my girlfriends we
were just so jealous of you.

746
00:34:35,003 --> 00:34:36,350
- Really?

747
00:34:36,384 --> 00:34:39,732
- Yes, he was just so arty and
into you.

748
00:34:41,182 --> 00:34:45,600
Imagine it, you would have
had like the cutest kids,

749
00:34:45,635 --> 00:34:47,292
big house, 2.5 kids.

750
00:34:48,707 --> 00:34:51,296
- Medium house with three kids.

751
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,126
- Yeah right.

752
00:34:55,369 --> 00:34:56,991
- What?

753
00:34:57,025 --> 00:35:00,408
- I just can't picture you
as the mother of three.

754
00:35:00,443 --> 00:35:02,893
The mother of anything.

755
00:35:02,928 --> 00:35:07,105
- Jill I would make a very
disheveled but charming mother.

756
00:35:09,969 --> 00:35:11,626
A very good one.

757
00:35:11,661 --> 00:35:12,834
- You slay me.

758
00:35:14,388 --> 00:35:15,837
- It's true.

759
00:35:15,872 --> 00:35:19,186
- Sophie, remember you're a
lightweight.

760
00:35:20,739 --> 00:35:21,981
- Not tonight.

761
00:35:22,016 --> 00:35:22,982
- [Announcer] Ladies and
gentlemen please find your
seats.

762
00:35:23,017 --> 00:35:25,123
Sting has arrived--

763
00:35:25,157 --> 00:35:26,193
- Oh my gosh.

764
00:35:31,301 --> 00:35:34,132
[crowd murmuring]

765
00:35:35,305 --> 00:35:37,376
Oh my gosh that was such a
great event.

766
00:35:37,411 --> 00:35:38,895
I wish that he would have sang

767
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:40,586
more than three or four songs.

768
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:41,760
It was four.

769
00:35:41,794 --> 00:35:44,211
- You know I think I'm getting
a little bit tired, so.

770
00:35:44,245 --> 00:35:45,073
- Tired?

771
00:35:45,108 --> 00:35:46,627
What is it, it's nine o'clock.

772
00:35:46,661 --> 00:35:48,180
- Club soda?

773
00:35:48,215 --> 00:35:49,043
- Come on.

774
00:35:49,906 --> 00:35:51,010
Three's dancing.

775
00:35:51,045 --> 00:35:52,874
Woo hoo, come on girl.

776
00:35:53,841 --> 00:35:56,602
- No no no no, Sophie, Sophie,
no no no.

777
00:35:56,637 --> 00:35:59,571
[loud dance music]

778
00:36:01,711 --> 00:36:05,197
[camera shutter clicking]

779
00:36:10,685 --> 00:36:14,862
'Cause I don't want nobody
but you

780
00:36:17,658 --> 00:36:20,730
[crowd cheering]

781
00:36:20,764 --> 00:36:24,941
'Cause I don't want nobody
but you

782
00:36:26,287 --> 00:36:29,808
[camera shutter clicking]

783
00:36:31,603 --> 00:36:32,776
- Hello world!

784
00:36:34,399 --> 00:36:37,574
- Get down Sophie we're
going to get arrested.

785
00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:39,197
Sophie!

786
00:36:39,231 --> 00:36:41,544
- Oh gosh who cares.

787
00:36:41,578 --> 00:36:43,270
None of this is real anyway.

788
00:36:43,304 --> 00:36:46,790
- Well I don't feel like
spending the night in jail.

789
00:36:46,825 --> 00:36:48,585
- What happened to you?

790
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:52,175
What happened to my fun
loving little sister?

791
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,350
- Your fun living little
sister who has to wake up early

792
00:36:54,384 --> 00:36:58,008
in the morning to buy a
Christmas present for Mom?

793
00:36:58,043 --> 00:37:01,288
Don't worry I'll sign
your name on the card.

794
00:37:01,322 --> 00:37:04,946
- Jilly, Jilly oh Jilly
Jilly Jilly flower.

795
00:37:07,397 --> 00:37:08,950
- You're so weird.

796
00:37:08,985 --> 00:37:11,539
You haven't called me that in
years.

797
00:37:11,574 --> 00:37:13,645
It's almost like you're
back to your old self.

798
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:15,267
- I am my old self.

799
00:37:18,615 --> 00:37:19,616
This is not my life.

800
00:37:19,651 --> 00:37:21,860
It is not yours either.

801
00:37:21,894 --> 00:37:23,033
- You're drunk.

802
00:37:23,068 --> 00:37:24,449
- I love you.

803
00:37:24,483 --> 00:37:26,761
- Well I was drinking
cran-sodas.

804
00:37:26,796 --> 00:37:27,797
Here please.

805
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:32,111
[groaning]

806
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,770
- Look honey, Jill wait.

807
00:37:35,805 --> 00:37:37,600
Can't we just spend the
holidays together.

808
00:37:37,634 --> 00:37:41,880
We can do like we did when
we were kids when I would

809
00:37:41,914 --> 00:37:43,916
let you eat all those
chocolate thingys, you know,

810
00:37:43,951 --> 00:37:44,952
from the calendar.

811
00:37:44,986 --> 00:37:46,954
And then we could make
some stockings and eat,

812
00:37:46,988 --> 00:37:49,612
oh that Scotch salmon
from Nova Scotia is good.

813
00:37:49,646 --> 00:37:52,580
- I have plans with friends
upstate.

814
00:37:52,615 --> 00:37:53,823
- Bring them all along.

815
00:37:53,857 --> 00:37:56,722
I've got a very big house
and trust me I've got cooking

816
00:37:56,757 --> 00:37:57,896
for 20 down pat.

817
00:37:57,930 --> 00:37:59,691
- Maybe we can do something
in the New Year, okay?

818
00:37:59,725 --> 00:38:01,175
- Okay.

819
00:38:01,209 --> 00:38:02,728
- Sleep well, thanks for
everything.

820
00:38:02,763 --> 00:38:06,594
Drink lots of water and
Merry Christmas, okay?

821
00:38:08,803 --> 00:38:10,288
- Merry Christmas.

822
00:38:12,186 --> 00:38:14,326
[sighing]

823
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:24,785
[food sizzling]

824
00:38:24,819 --> 00:38:27,477
[phone ringing]

825
00:38:42,734 --> 00:38:45,012
[groaning]

826
00:38:45,875 --> 00:38:47,221
I love pancakes.

827
00:38:48,602 --> 00:38:51,121
Especially when they're burnt.

828
00:38:51,156 --> 00:38:53,641
- Since when do you eat carbs?

829
00:38:57,404 --> 00:39:00,407
- Is it always so quiet around
here?

830
00:39:02,443 --> 00:39:05,791
- When you were dating
that guy from the city gym,

831
00:39:05,826 --> 00:39:10,071
there was the sound of his
expensive electric shaver he
use.

832
00:39:10,106 --> 00:39:13,592
[imitates buzzing shaver]

833
00:39:15,145 --> 00:39:17,941
Though personally, I don't
think it's healthy for a man to

834
00:39:17,976 --> 00:39:20,979
shave so much, you know, down
there.

835
00:39:24,776 --> 00:39:27,019
[groaning]

836
00:39:35,442 --> 00:39:37,892
Hey Sophie, where are you?

837
00:39:37,927 --> 00:39:39,238
Hello?

838
00:39:39,273 --> 00:39:40,101
Sophie?

839
00:39:41,482 --> 00:39:42,759
Are you hiding?

840
00:39:44,071 --> 00:39:45,486
Where did you go?

841
00:39:51,699 --> 00:39:55,462
[melancholy Christmas music]

842
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,364
[kids chattering]

843
00:40:52,898 --> 00:40:53,727
- Hi.

844
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:58,007
Hi oh, are your hands cold?

845
00:40:58,041 --> 00:41:01,113
You should put your mittens on.

846
00:41:01,148 --> 00:41:02,460
Wish I had some.

847
00:41:09,674 --> 00:41:10,502
I'm sorry.

848
00:41:15,818 --> 00:41:18,614
[sighing]

849
00:41:18,648 --> 00:41:21,582
[melancholy music]

850
00:41:29,659 --> 00:41:30,488
Anne? Nik?

851
00:41:37,978 --> 00:41:41,153
[children chattering]

852
00:41:52,268 --> 00:41:56,444
- Get your roasted chestnuts
here, hot roasted chestnuts.

853
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:58,688
Merry Christmas.

854
00:41:58,723 --> 00:42:02,589
Get your roasted chestnuts
here, hot roasted chestnuts.

855
00:42:03,762 --> 00:42:04,763
- You!

856
00:42:04,798 --> 00:42:05,592
- Hey!

857
00:42:05,626 --> 00:42:06,454
- You!

858
00:42:06,489 --> 00:42:08,526
- Whoa with the violence again.

859
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,563
You know you would have
made a great wingman.

860
00:42:11,598 --> 00:42:12,771
- You think this is funny?

861
00:42:12,806 --> 00:42:14,601
What kind of Christmas present
is this?

862
00:42:14,635 --> 00:42:16,913
- Hey, you're the one that
wished for the new life.

863
00:42:16,948 --> 00:42:19,295
- What good is a new life when
the ghosts of your old life

864
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:22,574
keep coming back to haunt
you ever single day.

865
00:42:22,609 --> 00:42:24,369
- You wanted the Manolos
sweetheart,

866
00:42:24,403 --> 00:42:26,336
now you gotta walk the walk.

867
00:42:26,371 --> 00:42:28,338
- Manolos gave me bunions in
the 90s

868
00:42:28,373 --> 00:42:30,237
and now that I have kids
they don't even fit.

869
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:32,653
And speaking of my kids, where
are they?

870
00:42:32,688 --> 00:42:33,723
Do they exist?

871
00:42:33,758 --> 00:42:34,586
Will they ever exist?

872
00:42:34,621 --> 00:42:35,863
And my husband?

873
00:42:35,898 --> 00:42:39,522
Just please, just tell me what
to do to reverse this thing.

874
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,834
- Okay.

875
00:42:40,868 --> 00:42:42,180
It's simple.

876
00:42:42,214 --> 00:42:46,287
You just gotta figure out
what's really important.

877
00:42:46,322 --> 00:42:49,394
- My family, my husband, shoes
that fit.

878
00:42:49,428 --> 00:42:50,844
Isn't it obvious?

879
00:42:51,776 --> 00:42:55,711
Oh please I would do
anything to just see them.

880
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,335
- Don't start crying geez.

881
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:07,723
[children chattering]

882
00:43:14,384 --> 00:43:15,316
- Oh Nikki.

883
00:43:16,455 --> 00:43:17,871
- [Kids] I love you Mommy.

884
00:43:17,905 --> 00:43:18,837
I love you.

885
00:43:22,254 --> 00:43:23,635
- Don't go, wait!

886
00:43:25,361 --> 00:43:26,776
That's just mean!

887
00:43:27,674 --> 00:43:29,192
I have no more time for riddles.

888
00:43:29,227 --> 00:43:30,918
Just tell me what to do.

889
00:43:30,953 --> 00:43:31,850
- I'm sorry.

890
00:43:31,885 --> 00:43:33,162
It doesn't work that way.

891
00:43:33,196 --> 00:43:35,682
You have gotta figure
this out on your own.

892
00:43:35,716 --> 00:43:39,789
You gotta dig deep, you gotta
look for the soul of this.

893
00:43:39,824 --> 00:43:42,343
When it comes you'll know.

894
00:43:42,378 --> 00:43:45,105
You're gonna feel it, right
here.

895
00:43:46,727 --> 00:43:48,453
- I screwed up, I know that.

896
00:43:48,487 --> 00:43:49,661
Isn't that enough?

897
00:43:49,696 --> 00:43:53,838
- Just start at the beginning,
the answer will come.

898
00:44:01,846 --> 00:44:03,433
It starts with a D.

899
00:44:04,331 --> 00:44:05,159
- Dave.

900
00:44:08,059 --> 00:44:10,889
Okay the last time I was talking
to Dave I was mad at him.

901
00:44:10,924 --> 00:44:15,100
Okay, so I need to find him
somewhere and apologize.

902
00:44:17,378 --> 00:44:18,207
Okay.

903
00:44:23,799 --> 00:44:26,318
- Oh and Soph, one more thing.

904
00:44:27,561 --> 00:44:29,218
You've got 'til the close
Christmas Eve

905
00:44:29,252 --> 00:44:31,082
to make any exchanges.

906
00:44:34,741 --> 00:44:39,228
Get your roasted chestnuts
here, hot roasted chestnuts.

907
00:44:39,262 --> 00:44:40,436
Low in sodium.

00:44:41,817 --> 00:44:44,336
[light music]

909
00:45:03,045 --> 00:45:03,873
- Hello?

910
00:45:08,464 --> 00:45:09,292
Dave?

911
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,712
- You're early, I have--

912
00:45:15,678 --> 00:45:16,506
Sophie?

913
00:45:21,511 --> 00:45:23,686
- It's so good to see you.

914
00:45:24,549 --> 00:45:25,895
- Did someone die.

915
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:28,277
- No, no, you look so great.

916
00:45:30,106 --> 00:45:31,383
- What are you doing here.

917
00:45:31,418 --> 00:45:33,765
- You know how hard it is to
find a good diner in the city?

918
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,768
There's one over there
and I thought I'd come by

919
00:45:36,803 --> 00:45:38,149
and say hi.

920
00:45:38,183 --> 00:45:39,012
Hi.

921
00:45:39,909 --> 00:45:41,290
- Hi.

922
00:45:41,324 --> 00:45:43,257
- Um could I come in?

923
00:45:43,292 --> 00:45:45,121
- Um, yeah I guess so.

924
00:45:47,434 --> 00:45:48,262
This way.

925
00:45:49,263 --> 00:45:52,508
I'm just on my way out of town,
so.

926
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:55,166
- Wow this place is not
like I remembered it.

927
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,754
- Well when they turned
the building into condos

928
00:45:56,788 --> 00:46:00,274
I decided to ramp it up a
little bit.

929
00:46:00,309 --> 00:46:01,966
- You've designed buildings
all over the world.

930
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,416
I forgot how talented you are.

931
00:46:04,451 --> 00:46:06,660
- Well my favorite is
this community center

932
00:46:06,694 --> 00:46:09,249
I'm trying to get built
down by the water, but,

933
00:46:09,283 --> 00:46:12,045
you know, no money, monster
hours.

934
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:14,599
- And kind too, I forgot that.

935
00:46:17,188 --> 00:46:19,811
- Okay Sophie, why are you
really here?

936
00:46:19,846 --> 00:46:21,364
- I thought that we
could catch up, you know.

937
00:46:21,399 --> 00:46:22,883
Go over old times.

938
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,853
- Oh is this some kind of
closure thing

939
00:46:26,887 --> 00:46:29,821
because honestly I'm good,
really.

940
00:46:29,856 --> 00:46:32,617
- Oh wow, gee look at this.

941
00:46:32,651 --> 00:46:33,963
Self-improvement.

942
00:46:33,998 --> 00:46:37,173
From the Inside Out, you
working on that.

943
00:46:37,208 --> 00:46:39,141
- Yeah it's a little holiday
break.

944
00:46:39,175 --> 00:46:40,901
- At a health spa?

945
00:46:40,936 --> 00:46:42,938
- Well I haven't had a vacation
in years,

946
00:46:42,972 --> 00:46:45,388
or Christmas actually, so it's,

947
00:46:45,423 --> 00:46:46,976
just call it my attempt at one.

948
00:46:47,011 --> 00:46:49,807
- Oh god, we used to love
to go away before the kids.

949
00:46:49,841 --> 00:46:50,669
- Kids?

950
00:46:52,188 --> 00:46:56,365
- Ah, look what I'm going
to say is going to sound

951
00:46:58,091 --> 00:46:59,333
a little weird.

952
00:47:01,577 --> 00:47:02,750
- Go on.

953
00:47:02,785 --> 00:47:05,512
- What if I told you that we
didn't break up in college

954
00:47:05,546 --> 00:47:07,859
and that we did get
married and we have three

955
00:47:07,894 --> 00:47:12,864
wonderful, amazing, slightly
ill-behaved children.

956
00:47:12,899 --> 00:47:15,487
- Oh you know what I gotta go.

957
00:47:15,522 --> 00:47:17,282
- No please let me explain.

958
00:47:17,317 --> 00:47:19,560
See I was having this
really really horrible day

959
00:47:19,595 --> 00:47:21,424
because Anna wouldn't wear her
socks,

960
00:47:21,459 --> 00:47:23,219
and Nikki, she's going through
one of those weird phases

961
00:47:23,254 --> 00:47:25,428
where she's talking
back and wearing makeup

962
00:47:25,463 --> 00:47:27,430
and then JJ was throwing
up all over the place

963
00:47:27,465 --> 00:47:29,087
and I found myself at the
mall and there was this

964
00:47:29,122 --> 00:47:30,468
really, really weird Santa

965
00:47:30,502 --> 00:47:32,884
and then I ran into Marcia Wade.

966
00:47:32,919 --> 00:47:34,334
Do you remember Marcia Wade?

967
00:47:34,368 --> 00:47:36,854
You know and she looks great
and I was yelling at you

968
00:47:36,888 --> 00:47:39,132
on the phone and I'm really,
really sorry about that.

969
00:47:39,166 --> 00:47:41,859
See this is me apologizing.

970
00:47:41,893 --> 00:47:42,687
Anyone up there?

971
00:47:42,721 --> 00:47:43,515
Come on.

972
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:44,482
Any time now, come on.

973
00:47:44,516 --> 00:47:45,379
[fingers snapping]

974
00:47:45,414 --> 00:47:46,725
- You know what I should call
someone.

975
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:47,899
Can I call someone for you?

976
00:47:47,934 --> 00:47:50,902
- Look the point is I didn't
mean for my entire family

977
00:47:50,937 --> 00:47:51,765
to disappear.

978
00:47:51,799 --> 00:47:54,457
I just needed a good night's
sleep.

979
00:47:54,492 --> 00:47:56,908
- Okay Sophie I gotta tell you,
you're freaking me out now.

980
00:47:56,943 --> 00:47:59,911
- I know none of this makes
any sense to you or me

981
00:47:59,946 --> 00:48:01,913
but maybe it will some day.

982
00:48:01,948 --> 00:48:05,710
But the thing is in order
to reverse this thing

983
00:48:05,744 --> 00:48:07,954
I need to find out what's
really important to me

984
00:48:07,988 --> 00:48:09,783
and that begins with you.

985
00:48:09,817 --> 00:48:11,854
It all starts with you, Dave.

986
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,821
You and me as a family.

987
00:48:14,822 --> 00:48:16,341
Please.

988
00:48:16,376 --> 00:48:19,586
- Why now, of all times why now.

989
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:22,830
- Dave from the bottom
of my heart I am so sorry

990
00:48:22,865 --> 00:48:24,936
for not trying hard
enough and for making you

991
00:48:24,971 --> 00:48:28,077
have your office in the laundry
room.

992
00:48:31,943 --> 00:48:34,877
- Uh hey, honey can you believe
it?

993
00:48:36,396 --> 00:48:39,192
Sophie was just in the
neighborhood and--

994
00:48:39,226 --> 00:48:40,089
- Honey?

995
00:48:40,124 --> 00:48:41,608
- Let me fill you in since I'm
guessing

996
00:48:41,642 --> 00:48:43,058
Dave hasn't gotten around to it.

997
00:48:43,092 --> 00:48:45,405
- Well I was just about to.

998
00:48:45,439 --> 00:48:47,821
- Fill me in on what Dave?

999
00:48:47,855 --> 00:48:49,305
- It's an interesting story.

1000
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:51,756
- Yes a tragedy with a happy
ending.

1001
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:52,930
After you put me out
of business last year,

1002
00:48:52,964 --> 00:48:55,346
you know bankrupting
my firm and putting me

1003
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:57,900
and my 25 employees out of work,

1004
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:01,317
I had a little time on my
hands so I ran a marathon,

1005
00:49:01,352 --> 00:49:04,286
took up crochet and reconnected
with a few old friends

1006
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,944
from college, like Dave.

1007
00:49:06,978 --> 00:49:08,186
- Facebook.

1008
00:49:08,221 --> 00:49:10,292
- Anyway one thing led
to the next and well,

1009
00:49:10,326 --> 00:49:12,328
we're both still single.

1010
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:16,746
- Your mother's heirloom
engagement ring, it's mine.

1011
00:49:16,781 --> 00:49:18,265
- It's going to be a
simple wedding really.

1012
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:22,028
Just us, some relaxing
yoga and some massage.

1013
00:49:24,168 --> 00:49:25,963
- You're getting married?

1014
00:49:25,997 --> 00:49:27,550
- On Christmas Eve.

1015
00:49:28,931 --> 00:49:30,174
- You love her.

1016
00:49:30,208 --> 00:49:32,210
You forgot all about me.

1017
00:49:33,936 --> 00:49:35,593
How did this happen?

1018
00:49:38,423 --> 00:49:41,254
- Well I'm sorry Sophie but you
and I,

1019
00:49:41,288 --> 00:49:43,394
that was a long time ago.

1020
00:49:48,088 --> 00:49:50,263
- I'm going to go to work.

1021
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:52,886
- Probably.

1022
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:00,204
- What?

1023
00:50:00,238 --> 00:50:01,860
She just showed up.

1024
00:50:09,351 --> 00:50:12,112
- Oh come on Sophie, you're the
CEO

1025
00:50:12,147 --> 00:50:15,115
of one of the biggest law
firms in the whole city.

1026
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:18,429
Just get it together,
just get it together.

1027
00:50:18,463 --> 00:50:21,708
[crying and sniffling]

1028
00:50:26,575 --> 00:50:27,334
Hi.

1029
00:50:27,369 --> 00:50:28,197
- Hello.

1030
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,409
- You hate me don't you.

1031
00:50:33,444 --> 00:50:35,032
- Hate is a very strong word.

1032
00:50:35,066 --> 00:50:38,759
- Well I'm a terrible
boss, I'm a bad mother,

1033
00:50:38,794 --> 00:50:40,451
I'm an awful person.

1034
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,077
Oh god I hate this mascara.

1035
00:50:46,112 --> 00:50:48,769
And those eyelash curlers, you
know,

1036
00:50:48,804 --> 00:50:51,531
guys could never use them.

1037
00:50:51,565 --> 00:50:55,880
I'm a 60 percenter in
a hundred percent world

1038
00:50:55,914 --> 00:50:58,020
and now I'm being punished.

1039
00:50:58,055 --> 00:50:59,539
- Do you want me to get Morris?

1040
00:50:59,573 --> 00:51:01,920
- I just have to try harder.

1041
00:51:05,648 --> 00:51:07,719
I have to start with you.

1042
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:12,966
What can I do to make your life
better?

1043
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,450
- Seriously?

1044
00:51:14,485 --> 00:51:15,313
- Yeah.

1045
00:51:17,281 --> 00:51:21,630
- Well the whole maternity
leave policy sucks.

1046
00:51:21,664 --> 00:51:24,046
I mean how am I seriously
expected to be back on the job

1047
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,841
two weeks after I have this
baby?

1048
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:27,739
I need to be able to be a good
lawyer

1049
00:51:27,774 --> 00:51:29,672
and be a decent parent.

1050
00:51:31,467 --> 00:51:33,435
- You know what, take as
much time as you need.

1051
00:51:33,469 --> 00:51:35,057
- Can I get that in writing?

1052
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:37,887
- Yeah, yeah, Morris will draw
it up.

1053
00:51:37,922 --> 00:51:39,337
- Wow, thank you.

1054
00:51:44,031 --> 00:51:44,860
Really.

1055
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:49,623
- Call it new appreciation
for the working Mom.

1056
00:51:53,489 --> 00:51:55,664
[sobbing]

1057
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:07,917
[upbeat Christmas music]

1058
00:52:21,517 --> 00:52:24,175
- So how is it that the new
most popular girl in school

1059
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:27,213
isn't even at her own soiree?

1060
00:52:27,247 --> 00:52:30,008
- Have you ever wished that
you had a different life?

1061
00:52:30,043 --> 00:52:31,872
[laughing]

1062
00:52:31,907 --> 00:52:34,392
- Yeah like only every day.

1063
00:52:34,427 --> 00:52:37,119
See, this is my happy work face.

1064
00:52:39,294 --> 00:52:41,779
- Alright alright, I officially
apologize for being a pain

1065
00:52:41,813 --> 00:52:43,574
to work with.

1066
00:52:43,608 --> 00:52:45,196
Okay?

1067
00:52:45,231 --> 00:52:47,923
- What about my last employee
review where you called me fat

1068
00:52:47,957 --> 00:52:49,200
and said that if I didn't lose
weight

1069
00:52:49,235 --> 00:52:51,478
it would be bad for the
company's image.

1070
00:52:51,513 --> 00:52:53,066
- You look great.

1071
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:53,929
- I know.

1072
00:52:55,448 --> 00:52:59,037
- Yeah, you know my whole
career I've wondered

1073
00:52:59,072 --> 00:53:02,075
what it would be like
if I focused on the job

1074
00:53:02,109 --> 00:53:03,973
instead of my family

1075
00:53:04,008 --> 00:53:05,251
and here it is.

1076
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:11,084
I've destroyed every important
relationship I've ever had.

1077
00:53:11,118 --> 00:53:11,947
For what?

1078
00:53:12,879 --> 00:53:14,605
80 pairs of shoes.

1079
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:17,228
Time to put on my makeup.

1080
00:53:17,263 --> 00:53:18,609
Big empty house.

1081
00:53:20,231 --> 00:53:21,059
God.

1082
00:53:22,164 --> 00:53:25,167
- Well if there's anything I
can do.

1083
00:53:28,584 --> 00:53:30,586
- Can you keep a secret?

1084
00:53:37,352 --> 00:53:39,457
- What a fantastic story.

1085
00:53:39,492 --> 00:53:43,185
A wiseguy Santa, lingerie and a
fur coat.

1086
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,359
- You don't think I'm crazy?

1087
00:53:44,393 --> 00:53:48,397
- Oh yeah, absolutely, but
your story gives me hope.

1088
00:53:48,432 --> 00:53:49,985
- Don't you see, if I don't
figure out

1089
00:53:50,019 --> 00:53:51,607
how to reverse this thing by
Christmas Eve

1090
00:53:51,642 --> 00:53:55,335
I'm in danger of losing my
family forever.

1091
00:53:55,370 --> 00:53:57,682
- Well for starters you
have to stop Marcia Wade

1092
00:53:57,717 --> 00:53:58,856
from marrying Dave.

1093
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:00,029
- Yeah but how can I do that.

1094
00:54:00,064 --> 00:54:00,996
He thinks I'm crazy.

1095
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:03,240
He doesn't even know who I am
any more.

1096
00:54:03,274 --> 00:54:04,689
- Well then he needs
to get to re-know you.

1097
00:54:04,724 --> 00:54:07,347
Remember what he loved about
you in the first place.

1098
00:54:07,382 --> 00:54:10,454
Listen you took Marcia Wade
down once, you can do it again.

1099
00:54:10,488 --> 00:54:11,317
- But that was business.

1100
00:54:11,351 --> 00:54:13,560
I don't want to take anybody
down.

1101
00:54:13,595 --> 00:54:16,322
Besides, we used to be friends.

1102
00:54:16,356 --> 00:54:18,151
- Santa said start at the
beginning.

1103
00:54:18,185 --> 00:54:21,396
Your family begins with the two
of you.

1104
00:54:22,742 --> 00:54:24,640
Besides it wouldn't look
very good if you just

1105
00:54:24,675 --> 00:54:27,194
let your husband run off
and marry somebody else.

1106
00:54:27,229 --> 00:54:28,195
- You're right, you're right.

1107
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:29,990
I've gotta get to that spa.

1108
00:54:30,025 --> 00:54:31,475
- I'll book you a room.

1109
00:54:31,509 --> 00:54:34,547
- Do you think I could
really win him back?

1110
00:54:34,581 --> 00:54:38,758
- Sophie, you are ruthless,
cruel and have fantastic teeth.

1111
00:54:41,416 --> 00:54:42,658
I know you can.

Jake, what?

1117
00:55:06,061 --> 00:55:08,028
- Would you mind explaining
to me why you've not

1118
00:55:08,063 --> 00:55:10,341
been returning my phone calls?

1119
00:55:10,376 --> 00:55:14,069
- Well you know Christmas, busy
busy busy.

1120
00:55:14,103 --> 00:55:17,555
- Odd response considering
I'm your biggest client

1121
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:19,695
and we made plans to spend
the holiday together.

1122
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:21,318
- We did?

1123
00:55:21,352 --> 00:55:22,353
[laughing]

1124

And after six months of sexual
tension

1126
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:29,740
I'm not sure I get the joke.

1127

- Ah well um, here's the thing.

1128
00:55:33,053 --> 00:55:36,229
About those plans, um something
came up.

1129

I have to cancel.

1130
00:55:37,161 --> 00:55:38,576
A family emergency.

1131
00:55:38,611 --> 00:55:40,267

1132
00:55:40,302 --> 00:55:41,130

that part of the evening.

like this side of you.

Makes me hot.

1137
00:55:58,803 --> 00:56:01,565
Aunt Margaret on the other
hand is a little less enthused.

1138
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:05,603
- Well she'll get over
it 'cause she's old.

1139
00:56:05,638 --> 00:56:06,846
- We need a distraction.

1140
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,366
We need to do something special
for her over the holidays.

1141
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,057
This could kill the deal Sophie.

1142
00:56:11,091 --> 00:56:13,818
- Yeah well some things
just aren't meant to be.

1143
00:56:13,853 --> 00:56:18,375
- Trust me a 50 million dollar
land deal is meant to be.

1144
00:56:18,409 --> 00:56:20,480
- I don't really care about
money.

- Since when?

1147
00:56:22,827 --> 00:56:24,311
- I just went to law school
to make my Dad happy,

1148
00:56:24,346 --> 00:56:27,418
and then I bought a house
and I was supporting

You're going to have to
do this one on your own.

1154
00:56:38,153 --> 00:56:39,430
- No way.

1155
00:56:39,465 --> 00:56:40,638
You got me into this
jam with Aunt Margaret.

Some quality family time.

do.

coming?

that the limo broke down.

to have our parents here.

Dad and his cigars in here.

age to make such a big deal.

I'm here is 'cause

from marrying Marcia Wade.

It's not that she's not a nice
person

1222
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:06,016
because I think she is really
deep down.

- Yes, no, yes, no.

1225
01:00:09,882 --> 01:00:14,058
The real, real reason I'm
here is because all that stuff

I told you about, you and
me being married, is true

1229

- Go back, just, just back.

1232

- Look I know I wasn't
the most attentive wife

1233
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:29,695
and I should have been more
supportive of your career

1234
01:00:29,729 --> 01:00:30,661
and I kind of let myself go.

You think I'm crazy because
hello,

but I really have to try.

I have to try really hard
and I'm running out of time.

you know.

the Twinkie out of my hand.

01:01:30,065 --> 01:01:32,516
- She admires your independence.

1257
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:36,693
Me on the other hand she
considers to be a very bad boy.

1258
01:01:41,663 --> 01:01:42,491
- Yeah.

1259
01:01:43,734 --> 01:01:46,944
- You see you're forgetting our
deal.

1260
01:01:46,979 --> 01:01:48,532
- Oh the land transfer deal.

1261
01:01:48,566 --> 01:01:50,741
The contracts are right over
there.

1262
01:01:50,776 --> 01:01:52,467
- No our other deal.

1263
01:01:53,986 --> 01:01:55,194
[laughing]

1264
01:01:55,228 --> 01:01:58,956
- You know I think that Morris
forgot to pack that file.

1265
01:01:58,991 --> 01:02:00,613
- Whoa whoa whoa wait wait wait.

1266
01:02:00,647 --> 01:02:03,133
How do you think your firm got
this gig in the first place?

1267
01:02:03,167 --> 01:02:05,722
- Because I'm a really hard
worker with an eye for fairness.

1268
01:02:05,756 --> 01:02:06,930
[laughing]

1269
01:02:06,964 --> 01:02:08,207
- Guess again.

1270
01:02:08,241 --> 01:02:10,830
- Because I'm a ruthless cow
who's willing to sleep her way

1271
01:02:10,865 --> 01:02:12,798
into the big leagues.

1272
01:02:12,832 --> 01:02:15,490
- Look you get what you want.

1273
01:02:15,524 --> 01:02:17,009
I get what I want.

1274
01:02:17,975 --> 01:02:20,737
- You really think that's
what it takes to get ahead?

1275
01:02:20,771 --> 01:02:22,186
- Yeah, it helps.

1276
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:28,054
It's that guy isn't it?

1277
01:02:28,089 --> 01:02:30,954
Who the hell is he anyway?

1278
01:02:30,988 --> 01:02:32,093
- He's a really great architect.

1279
01:02:32,127 --> 01:02:33,888
He's an old friend.

1280
01:02:33,922 --> 01:02:36,062
Small time land developer.

1281
01:02:36,097 --> 01:02:37,305
- Are you trying to screw
me out of this land deal?

1282
01:02:37,339 --> 01:02:38,789
Because if you are--

1283
01:02:38,824 --> 01:02:41,999
- Believe me I have no
interest in your land deal

1284
01:02:42,034 --> 01:02:43,829
and your inheritance.

1285
01:02:43,863 --> 01:02:45,347
None.

1286
01:02:45,382 --> 01:02:47,522
- You mean, you won't sleep
with me

1287
01:02:47,556 --> 01:02:49,800
just because I'm rich and
powerful?

1288
01:02:49,835 --> 01:02:53,977
- I would never sleep with
someone to get ahead, okay?

1289
01:03:00,328 --> 01:03:03,918
- I finally found a woman
who likes me for me.

1290
01:03:03,952 --> 01:03:05,712
Oh Sophie, oh Sophie.

1291
01:03:10,338 --> 01:03:13,444
- Just hold that thought for
one minute.

1292
01:03:13,479 --> 01:03:16,344
Hello, is this the Bay Ridge
Mall?

1293
01:03:16,378 --> 01:03:17,414
I have a bit of an emergency.

1294
01:03:17,448 --> 01:03:19,450
I need to know what time the
mall closes.

1295
01:03:19,485 --> 01:03:21,936
Or at least the Santa station.

1296
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:24,110
Okay, thank you very much.

1297
01:03:24,145 --> 01:03:24,939
[phone beeps]

1298
01:03:24,973 --> 01:03:26,630
[ominous music]

1299
01:03:26,664 --> 01:03:27,838
Please don't hit me.

1300
01:03:27,873 --> 01:03:31,773
- How dare you suggest that
we call off this wedding?

1301
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:34,086
- Listen I know how
this looks, and trust me

1302
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:35,846
you don't want to know
the real reason I'm here

1303
01:03:35,881 --> 01:03:37,330
any more than the lie
I'm about to tell you,

1304
01:03:37,365 --> 01:03:38,504
so why don't you just
give me a few minutes

1305
01:03:38,538 --> 01:03:39,436
to talk with him alone.

1306
01:03:39,470 --> 01:03:41,990
- Just stay away from my fiance.

1307
01:03:42,025 --> 01:03:44,579
If I catch you within two
feet of us while we are here,

1308
01:03:44,613 --> 01:03:47,444
I am getting a restraining
order.

1309
01:03:47,478 --> 01:03:50,136
[ominous music]

1310
01:03:59,387 --> 01:04:01,078
I was thinking with the
snow capped mountains

1311
01:04:01,113 --> 01:04:03,287
in the background, the
patio would be perfect

1312
01:04:03,322 --> 01:04:05,600
for our wedding photos.

1313
01:04:05,634 --> 01:04:10,225
And this room could be a
fantastic place to have

1314
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:14,505
an intimate dinner with
our closest friends and--

1315
01:04:14,540 --> 01:04:17,888
- Well this is going to be
interesting.

1316
01:04:17,923 --> 01:04:20,995
- Oh yes, flowers, we need
flowers...

1317
01:04:27,173 --> 01:04:28,692
- What am I doing?

1318
01:04:30,936 --> 01:04:32,247
I'm just stupid.

1319
01:04:33,731 --> 01:04:35,906
- I'm on to you dear.

1320
01:04:35,941 --> 01:04:37,011
- Oh?

1321
01:04:37,045 --> 01:04:40,980
- At first I assumed you
were simply after my nephew

1322
01:04:41,015 --> 01:04:43,465
but then I realized
you're too smart for him.

1323
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:45,191
And so the question remains,

1324
01:04:45,226 --> 01:04:48,367
what is it exactly that you
want.

1325
01:04:48,401 --> 01:04:50,783
- Oh to close the deal
and all that corporate--

1326
01:04:50,817 --> 01:04:52,302
- Who is that man?

1327
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:57,617
- You know what, you
wouldn't understand it.

1328
01:04:57,652 --> 01:05:00,793
- Trust me honey, at my
age nothing you could say

1329
01:05:00,827 --> 01:05:02,036
would shock me.

1330
01:05:04,659 --> 01:05:05,729
- My husband.

1331
01:05:06,730 --> 01:05:07,558
- I see.

1332
01:05:09,422 --> 01:05:11,079
- It's a long story.

1333
01:05:11,977 --> 01:05:13,357
- Stories are in the past dear.

1334
01:05:13,392 --> 01:05:15,912
What's to do about it now.

1335
01:05:15,946 --> 01:05:16,982
- Oh I don't know.

1336
01:05:17,016 --> 01:05:18,535
I don't even know why I'm here.

1337
01:05:18,569 --> 01:05:22,539
I should be at home reading
the Grinch, stuffing stockings,

1338
01:05:22,573 --> 01:05:24,437
resenting my in laws.

1339
01:05:24,472 --> 01:05:27,026
I made just a terrible mistake.

1340
01:05:27,958 --> 01:05:31,513
- You know, wealth
always came easy for me.

1341
01:05:34,102 --> 01:05:35,379
Success a snap.

1342
01:05:37,278 --> 01:05:40,626
But family, children, a man
that I love,

1343
01:05:41,834 --> 01:05:43,870
I didn't want any of that.

1344
01:05:43,905 --> 01:05:45,251
Wasn't possible with my career.

1345
01:05:45,286 --> 01:05:47,944
Heck I invented 24/7.

1346
01:05:49,497 --> 01:05:54,226
But you, I think there's
something else for you.

1347
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:58,437
You know dear, if there is
something else or someone else

1348
01:06:00,577 --> 01:06:02,268
who inspires you--

1349
01:06:02,303 --> 01:06:05,237
- There's four other people.

1350
01:06:05,271 --> 01:06:09,172
But I'm afraid I might
have lost them forever.

1351
01:06:09,206 --> 01:06:12,002
- Unless you get that man.

1352
01:06:12,037 --> 01:06:13,797
- I don't know.

1353
01:06:13,831 --> 01:06:15,557
It's all I have to go on right
now.

1354
01:06:15,592 --> 01:06:17,525
- Well then go.

1355
01:06:17,559 --> 01:06:20,148
- But you don't understand,
I've been trying.

1356
01:06:20,183 --> 01:06:21,011
Oh my gosh.

1357
01:06:21,046 --> 01:06:22,461
- Oh stop your whining already.

1358
01:06:22,495 --> 01:06:25,912
Go after him before it's too
late.

1359
01:06:25,947 --> 01:06:27,121
- Okay.

1360
01:06:27,155 --> 01:06:30,331
You're right, you're right,
thank you.

1361
01:06:35,508 --> 01:06:37,062
Why am I so nervous.

1362
01:06:37,096 --> 01:06:39,443
I've known this man forever.

1363
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:47,727
Keep it together Sophie, keep
it together.

1364
01:06:47,762 --> 01:06:48,763
Hey.

1365
01:06:48,797 --> 01:06:49,626
Psst.

1366
01:06:51,421 --> 01:06:52,249
Dave.

1367
01:06:54,424 --> 01:06:56,253
- Since when do you do yoga?

1368
01:06:56,288 --> 01:07:00,223
- Since when do you wear
a matching track suit?

1369
01:07:02,811 --> 01:07:04,123
- It was a gift.

1370
01:07:05,090 --> 01:07:07,092
- I'm sorry I'm just used
to seeing you in those

1371
01:07:07,126 --> 01:07:08,541
funky old sweats.

1372
01:07:10,164 --> 01:07:11,993
- Those sweats are a classic.

1373
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:13,132
- I know I just washed them.

1374
01:07:13,167 --> 01:07:15,617
They're sitting there unfolded
in the laundry basket.

1375
01:07:15,652 --> 01:07:16,446
- Shh.

1376
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:17,309
- Okay.

1377
01:07:18,862 --> 01:07:22,072
- Look, I also know
that you just found out

1378
01:07:22,107 --> 01:07:24,178
that you need glasses.

1379
01:07:24,212 --> 01:07:27,353
[gong ringing]

1380
01:07:27,388 --> 01:07:28,837
I bet even in this alternate
reality

1381
01:07:28,872 --> 01:07:30,701
you're trying to get
your band back together.

1382
01:07:30,736 --> 01:07:32,738
You know, your old band?

1383
01:07:34,498 --> 01:07:36,466
Dave, you won't buy coffee
from Starbucks because

1384
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:37,363
you think it's ridiculous

1385
01:07:37,398 --> 01:07:40,228
that they call a small coffee
tall.

1386
01:07:41,505 --> 01:07:43,921
Now look even if half of
what I say you believe,

1387
01:07:43,956 --> 01:07:44,819
I need you to just--

1388
01:07:44,853 --> 01:07:46,372
- You again.

1389
01:07:46,407 --> 01:07:47,822
That's it.

1390
01:07:47,856 --> 01:07:49,651
I'm calling security.

1391
01:07:49,686 --> 01:07:53,448
I am not going to let
you get away with this.

1392
01:07:54,449 --> 01:07:56,210
- Marcia, Marcia, wait, wait.

1393
01:07:56,244 --> 01:07:58,729
[gong ringing]

1394
01:07:58,764 --> 01:08:01,767
- Um, very relaxing class thank
you.

1395
01:08:05,564 --> 01:08:06,392
Ohm.

1396
01:08:09,154 --> 01:08:11,708
- First she took over my
business and now she's trying to

1397
01:08:11,742 --> 01:08:15,298
sabotage my wedding,
my kundalini, my life.

1398
01:08:16,230 --> 01:08:17,093
- Dave?

1399
01:08:18,853 --> 01:08:21,649
- Don't you take one step
closer.

1400
01:08:21,683 --> 01:08:23,306
- Look Marcia I know
that you're upset with me

1401
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:24,962
and I can't blame you, but--

1402
01:08:24,997 --> 01:08:26,102
- Sophie's just an old friend

1403
01:08:26,136 --> 01:08:27,551
who's going through a tough
time.

1404
01:08:27,586 --> 01:08:28,863
- Old friend, don't
you mean old girlfriend

1405
01:08:28,897 --> 01:08:30,036
who you still have a thing for?

1406
01:08:30,071 --> 01:08:31,383
- No I--

1407
01:08:31,417 --> 01:08:34,903
I'm, well, I don't know, I
didn't expect any of this.

1408
01:08:34,938 --> 01:08:35,835
- Damn you Dave Kelly you've
had cold feet

1409
01:08:35,870 --> 01:08:37,906
ever since she got here the
other day.

1410
01:08:37,941 --> 01:08:38,873
- You have?

1411
01:08:39,908 --> 01:08:41,427
- Just take this okay?

1412
01:08:41,462 --> 01:08:43,119
Take it, take it.

1413
01:08:43,153 --> 01:08:44,396
- That's my ring.

1414
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:45,431
- No it's my ring.

1415
01:08:45,466 --> 01:08:46,225
- Excuse me.

1416
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:47,606
- Excuse me.

1417
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:48,434
- It's my ring.

1418
01:08:48,469 --> 01:08:49,470
- Excuse me.

1419
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:52,680
- Ah okay just--

1420
01:08:52,714 --> 01:08:54,682
[grunting]

1421
01:08:54,716 --> 01:08:55,959
[metal ring pinging]

1422

[splatting]

1425
01:09:18,223 --> 01:09:20,570
- Get out of my way!

1426
01:09:20,604 --> 01:09:21,433
Excuse me.

1427
01:09:26,748 --> 01:09:29,855
- It is not I just had it
cleaned.

1428
01:09:29,889 --> 01:09:30,821
- Get back.

1429
01:09:32,547 --> 01:09:34,066
- It's my ring and I want it.

1430
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:35,481
- Would you stop.

1431
01:09:37,828 --> 01:09:39,002
- Where is it?

1432
01:09:42,902 --> 01:09:44,766
- I got it, I got it,
it's mine and you're not

1433
01:09:44,801 --> 01:09:45,595
getting it back from me.

1434
01:09:45,629 --> 01:09:46,423
- Give me the ring.

1435
01:09:46,458 --> 01:09:47,769
- No it's mine.

1436
01:09:47,804 --> 01:09:48,770
[cake splattering]

1437
01:09:48,805 --> 01:09:51,704
[grunting]

1438
01:09:51,739 --> 01:09:53,741
- I got it, I have it.

1439
01:09:53,775 --> 01:09:56,744
[cake splattering]

1440
01:09:56,778 --> 01:09:58,021
[crowd gasping]

1441
01:09:58,055 --> 01:09:59,954
- No, no Marcia no, no.

1442
01:10:01,887 --> 01:10:03,889
[grunting]

1443
01:10:03,923 --> 01:10:06,754
No, Sophie, Sophie, please
Sophie.

1444
01:10:07,962 --> 01:10:10,206
[grunting]

1445
01:10:12,725 --> 01:10:15,314
[cake splattering]

1446
01:10:15,349 --> 01:10:16,246
- Is that enough for you?

1447
01:10:16,281 --> 01:10:17,937
Did you want some more?

1448
01:10:17,972 --> 01:10:20,354
- [Dave] Marcia, Sophie, Sophie
come on.

1449
01:10:20,388 --> 01:10:22,356
- Where is it now?

1450
01:10:22,390 --> 01:10:23,219
- I don't know.

1451
01:10:23,253 --> 01:10:24,220
- It's gone.

1452
01:10:26,187 --> 01:10:29,639
And I was supposed to
be on a low carb diet.

1453
01:10:29,673 --> 01:10:31,848
[sighing]

1454
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:38,682
Hey.

1455
01:10:38,717 --> 01:10:39,718
- Oh great.

1456
01:10:39,752 --> 01:10:41,029
- No, no please.

1457
01:10:41,064 --> 01:10:41,858
Come here--

1458
01:10:41,892 --> 01:10:42,962
- You can't be serious.

1459
01:10:42,997 --> 01:10:44,136
- I want to apologize.

1460
01:10:44,170 --> 01:10:46,276
Please, sit down.

1461
01:10:46,311 --> 01:10:48,485
Honestly I'm really sorry.

1462
01:10:49,417 --> 01:10:51,833
I didn't mean to make you hate
me.

1463
01:10:51,868 --> 01:10:54,698
I was kind of immature back
there.

1464
01:10:55,872 --> 01:10:58,461
Although you were the first
person to hit me in the face.

1465
01:10:58,495 --> 01:10:59,807
- I was.

1466
01:10:59,841 --> 01:11:00,877
- We used to be friends.

1467
01:11:00,911 --> 01:11:02,154
What happened to us?

1468
01:11:02,188 --> 01:11:03,155
- Girl plague.

1469
01:11:03,189 --> 01:11:05,088
You know that female
competitive thing

1470
01:11:05,122 --> 01:11:09,610
that kicks in somewhere between
middle school and death?

1471
01:11:09,644 --> 01:11:10,680
- I am sorry.

1472
01:11:10,714 --> 01:11:12,751
I know you think I'm
crazy and that I'm trying

1473
01:11:12,785 --> 01:11:16,962
to ruin your life and I would
explain my twisted rationale

1474
01:11:18,308 --> 01:11:19,792
but you wouldn't believe
it unless you were six

1475
01:11:19,827 --> 01:11:22,070
and waiting for Santa Clause.

1476
01:11:22,105 --> 01:11:24,280
- What is it with this time of
year?

1477
01:11:24,314 --> 01:11:25,867
- Brings out the worst in
everyone.

1478
01:11:25,902 --> 01:11:27,041
- I don't know why we do it to
ourselves

1479
01:11:27,075 --> 01:11:29,354
because I am tired.

1480
01:11:29,388 --> 01:11:30,941
- So am I.

1481
01:11:30,976 --> 01:11:32,736
- It's not the men in our
lives, you now.

1482
01:11:32,771 --> 01:11:35,291
It's that women want
to impress each other.

1483
01:11:35,325 --> 01:11:38,086
They just want to out
Superwoman the next person.

1484
01:11:38,121 --> 01:11:39,398
And you now what we really want
to do

1485
01:11:39,433 --> 01:11:41,504
is open a bottle of wine, sit
on a beach,

1486
01:11:41,538 --> 01:11:45,956
and thank god that we weren't
born in the Middle Ages.

1487
01:11:45,991 --> 01:11:49,305
- Yeah but the corsets were
kind of hot.

1488
01:11:50,202 --> 01:11:51,030
- Well.

1489
01:11:52,722 --> 01:11:54,240
- This is the worst Christmas
ever.

1490
01:11:54,275 --> 01:11:56,484
- At least you got the guy.

1491
01:11:59,936 --> 01:12:01,144
- Really?

1492
01:12:01,178 --> 01:12:03,836
- Yeah, Dave still has a thing
for you.

1493
01:12:03,871 --> 01:12:05,597
He confessed.

1494
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:07,081
And I think you should go for
it.

1495
01:12:07,115 --> 01:12:08,358
It's okay.

1496
01:12:08,393 --> 01:12:12,569
Weirdly, very weirdly, I kinda
think that Jake Lasky's cute.

1497
01:12:14,985 --> 01:12:16,401
- I could so hook you up.

1498
01:12:16,435 --> 01:12:17,436
- Oh really?

1499
01:12:18,575 --> 01:12:20,405
Happy New Year Marcia.

1500
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:24,788
- Thanks.

1501
01:12:26,065 --> 01:12:29,966
- So what is it that you do
when you're not breaking hearts?

1502
01:12:31,105 --> 01:12:32,693
- I'm an architect.

1503
01:12:33,590 --> 01:12:36,006
- Condos, shopping malls?

1504
01:12:36,041 --> 01:12:38,595
- No not that kind of architect.

1505
01:12:38,630 --> 01:12:42,358
I'm more of an idealist
than a mogul I guess.

1506
01:12:43,428 --> 01:12:45,844
Current project I have
is a state of the art

1507
01:12:45,878 --> 01:12:48,329
community center with
pools and soccer fields

1508
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:51,263
and a non-profit daycare.

1509
01:12:51,297 --> 01:12:54,887
Kind of like a place
for parents and families

1510
01:12:54,922 --> 01:12:56,993
who could never afford private.

1511
01:12:57,027 --> 01:12:58,581
- Sounds wonderful.

1512
01:12:59,547 --> 01:13:01,238
- Yeah and it will be
as soon as we can find

1513
01:13:01,273 --> 01:13:03,931
someone to donate the land.

1514
01:13:03,965 --> 01:13:05,760
Quite a legacy.

1515
01:13:05,795 --> 01:13:06,623
- Yes.

1516
01:13:08,314 --> 01:13:09,730
Yes, it would be.

1517
01:13:13,147 --> 01:13:17,323
As my father always said,
the true measure of a man

1518
01:13:18,255 --> 01:13:22,398
is not about the deal in
hand, it's what he does next

1519
01:13:24,296 --> 01:13:26,022
that makes him great.

1520
01:13:29,439 --> 01:13:30,716
- Dave?

1521
01:13:30,751 --> 01:13:32,511
Dave, I've got to go.

1522
01:13:36,135 --> 01:13:38,034
- Thanks for the drink.

1523
01:13:40,554 --> 01:13:42,003
- Hey, come here.

1524
01:13:43,453 --> 01:13:46,007
I've got something to tell you.

1525
01:13:46,042 --> 01:13:47,871
- I've got one minute.

1526
01:13:53,118 --> 01:13:55,292
- Thank you so much for coming
with me.

1527
01:13:55,327 --> 01:13:57,709
- Well you were rushing
around and we didn't really

1528
01:13:57,743 --> 01:14:00,574
get the chance to talk to one
another, so.

1529
01:14:00,608 --> 01:14:01,920
- Yeah it was crowded.

1530
01:14:01,954 --> 01:14:05,786
I can't believe that Margaret
Lasky gave you all that land.

1531
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:07,408
- Well she didn't give it to me,

1532
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:11,032
she gave it to the kids of the
city.

1533
01:14:11,067 --> 01:14:12,033
What's something like that
worth?

1534
01:14:12,068 --> 01:14:13,345
10 million, 15?

1535
01:14:14,898 --> 01:14:16,624
Wow, Merry Christmas.

1536
01:14:18,350 --> 01:14:20,283
- Life is full of surprises.

1537
01:14:20,317 --> 01:14:21,387
- Yeah it is.

1538
01:14:24,114 --> 01:14:27,532
You know Margaret also said
that if I were to let you go

1539
01:14:27,566 --> 01:14:28,740
I'd be a fool.

1540
01:14:31,674 --> 01:14:34,400
Sophie, I don't know, I
mean 90% of this stuff

1541
01:14:34,435 --> 01:14:38,508
you talk about just sounds
absolutely ridiculous.

1542
01:14:40,199 --> 01:14:44,376
But then you describe that life
and it sounds pretty great.

1543
01:14:45,722 --> 01:14:47,724
- Well it's messy and it's noisy

1544
01:14:47,759 --> 01:14:50,451
and we never get to sleep alone.

1545
01:14:52,384 --> 01:14:54,800
Oh my god I forgot a
turkey, I forgot a turkey.

1546
01:14:54,835 --> 01:14:56,733
I need one of those that
are already thawed out

1547
01:14:56,768 --> 01:15:00,081
and those prosciutto things
that you love

1548
01:15:00,116 --> 01:15:01,738
and my Mom, and the Christmas
tree.

1549
01:15:01,773 --> 01:15:04,569
I wonder if you fixed the
Christmas tree.

1550
01:15:04,603 --> 01:15:05,777
Oh gee I have a deposition,

1551
01:15:05,811 --> 01:15:07,744
okay I'll wear that black wrap
dress.

1552
01:15:07,779 --> 01:15:09,539
- Do you know what Sophie
you have not changed

1553
01:15:09,574 --> 01:15:11,299
one little bit.

1554
01:15:11,334 --> 01:15:12,542
- What?

1555
01:15:12,577 --> 01:15:14,717
- Isn't this exactly why we
broke up in the first place?

1556
01:15:14,751 --> 01:15:17,443
You always had something on the
go.

1557
01:15:17,478 --> 01:15:19,273
Honestly I think you woke up
one morning and you forgot to

1558
01:15:19,307 --> 01:15:22,897
put me on your to do
list and that was that.

1559
01:15:22,932 --> 01:15:24,071
How much time do you have to
figure out

1560
01:15:24,105 --> 01:15:26,763
this magical curse thing?

1561
01:15:26,798 --> 01:15:29,248
- Oh god, just a few minutes.

1562
01:15:31,906 --> 01:15:35,876
- I don't know whether to kiss
you or have you committed.

1563
01:15:35,910 --> 01:15:36,980
- Maybe both.

1564
01:15:38,706 --> 01:15:40,018
Okay.

1565
01:15:40,052 --> 01:15:40,846
Here's the mall.

1566
01:15:40,881 --> 01:15:41,951
Wish me luck.

1567
01:15:43,780 --> 01:15:44,747
Okay.

1568
01:15:44,781 --> 01:15:45,955
- [Dave] Okay.

1569
01:15:47,646 --> 01:15:48,751
- This is it.

1570
01:15:50,476 --> 01:15:52,755
- Sophie I really hope you
find what you're looking for.

1571
01:15:52,789 --> 01:15:54,308
- Yeah me too, I--

1572
01:15:55,309 --> 01:15:56,137
Wait!

1573
01:15:57,069 --> 01:16:00,486
[joyful Christmas music]

1574
01:16:05,975 --> 01:16:08,529
[gasping]

1575
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:10,980
Oh my god I'm still here.

1576
01:16:11,014 --> 01:16:13,154
That was supposed to be a magic
kiss.

1577
01:16:13,189 --> 01:16:15,363
I did everything you told me to
do.

1578
01:16:15,398 --> 01:16:17,538
I went back to the beginning
and the beginning is Dave

1579
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:19,540
and I'm still here.

1580
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:20,403
Oh god.

1581
01:16:20,437 --> 01:16:21,542
- Sophie what are you doing?

1582
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:22,819
- Don't you see it didn't work.

1583
01:16:22,854 --> 01:16:24,683
I have to go back and
find that stupid Santa.

1584
01:16:24,718 --> 01:16:26,202
- No, no isn't it enough
that I'm willing to

1585
01:16:26,236 --> 01:16:27,721
go through this with you again.

1586
01:16:27,755 --> 01:16:28,998
I mean come on you don't have
to go on

1587
01:16:29,032 --> 01:16:30,827
with this charade, okay.

1588
01:16:30,862 --> 01:16:32,380
You won, you got me.

1589
01:16:32,415 --> 01:16:33,623
I'm yours.

1590
01:16:33,658 --> 01:16:35,418
So enough with the fairy tales.

1591
01:16:35,452 --> 01:16:37,144
- It's not a fairy tale Dave.

1592
01:16:37,178 --> 01:16:40,147
It's my life, it's your
life, it's our kids' life.

1593
01:16:40,181 --> 01:16:42,390
- Sophie, please don't go in
there.

1594
01:16:42,425 --> 01:16:44,634
Stay with me please.

1595
01:16:44,669 --> 01:16:46,602
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1596
01:16:47,913 --> 01:16:50,260
Let me in, let me in please!

1597
01:16:51,296 --> 01:16:53,125
Oh god, I have to try.

1598
01:16:57,233 --> 01:16:58,752
I know there's a back door.

1599
01:16:58,786 --> 01:17:00,305
Dave, wait for me.

1600
01:17:07,726 --> 01:17:08,589
Santa!

1601
01:17:09,832 --> 01:17:11,523
Santa please, Santa!

1602
01:17:14,284 --> 01:17:15,113
Santa!

1603
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:19,462
Oh god.

1604
01:17:21,567 --> 01:17:22,396
Santa.

1605
01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:26,849
No.

1606
01:17:30,404 --> 01:17:31,232
No, no.

1607
01:17:32,682 --> 01:17:34,822
[sobbing]

1608
01:17:59,744 --> 01:18:04,610
- So I got you the tree
and presents for children,

1609
01:18:04,645 --> 01:18:06,095
whoever they are.

1610
01:18:09,132 --> 01:18:12,860
- Thank you Sylvia, no really,
than you.

1611
01:18:12,895 --> 01:18:15,725
- You owe me 78 bucks and
I want time and a half

1612
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,934
for working Christmas Eve.

1613
01:18:19,108 --> 01:18:21,179
- Wow, that's fair, you deserve
that.

1614
01:18:21,213 --> 01:18:24,009
And something a lot more.

1615
01:18:24,044 --> 01:18:24,838
Here.

1616
01:18:24,872 --> 01:18:26,840
- I have keys.

1617
01:18:26,874 --> 01:18:28,565
- No, for the house.

1618
01:18:30,153 --> 01:18:32,604
I want you to have it.

1619
01:18:32,638 --> 01:18:35,124
- You going to take pills or
put your head in the oven?

1620
01:18:35,158 --> 01:18:36,228
- No I'm not.

1621
01:18:38,886 --> 01:18:41,061
- I'll be out tomorrow.

1622
01:18:41,095 --> 01:18:43,373
I want you to have it.

1623
01:18:43,408 --> 01:18:45,513
It's not really my style.

1624
01:18:52,935 --> 01:18:53,763
- I know.

1625
01:19:09,192 --> 01:19:11,367
[sighing]

1626

[melancholy music]

1627
01:19:35,184 --> 01:19:36,012
- Aw.

1628

[bells chiming]

1629
01:19:48,956 --> 01:19:51,648
- You're busy later, right Mom?

1630
01:19:51,683 --> 01:19:54,030
But it's for school.

1631
01:19:54,065 --> 01:19:56,619
You're busy later, right Mom?

1632
01:19:56,653 --> 01:20:00,485
Maybe I should have asked for
a Mom who cares about my life.

1633
01:20:00,519 --> 01:20:01,451
- Oh Nikki.

1634
01:20:02,763 --> 01:20:04,592
Oh I forgot your play.

1635
01:20:10,564 --> 01:20:12,290
- How you holdin' up?

1636
01:20:13,878 --> 01:20:16,570
- My whole life I've been so
worried

1637
01:20:16,604 --> 01:20:19,228
about accomplishing everything,
you know,

1638
01:20:19,262 --> 01:20:21,920
being the best, being in charge,

1639
01:20:22,887 --> 01:20:23,888
being right.

1640
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:28,927
I've been so wrapped up in my
own race to I don't know where

1641
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:34,795
I'm missing the stuff that
matters along the way.

1642
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:38,488
The things I should
have taken time to enjoy

1643
01:20:40,076 --> 01:20:41,975
like kissing my husband

1644
01:20:44,425 --> 01:20:47,428
and really listening to Anna
sing.

1645
01:20:47,463 --> 01:20:49,741
Those little morning snuggles
with JJ

1646
01:20:49,775 --> 01:20:53,918
and little Nikki, that play
was so important to her

1647
01:20:55,609 --> 01:20:58,336
and she was too proud to tell
me.

1648
01:20:59,716 --> 01:21:02,202
Oh, how could I let it happen?

1649
01:21:03,755 --> 01:21:05,274
How could I get so busy

1650
01:21:05,308 --> 01:21:08,484
that I'm actually missing my
own life?

1651
01:21:13,075 --> 01:21:15,767
I thought I wasn't doing enough,

1652
01:21:16,733 --> 01:21:19,391
but Dave had me all figured out.

1653
01:21:21,221 --> 01:21:25,950
My problem has always been
trying to do too much.

1654
01:21:25,984 --> 01:21:27,572
- Balance is important.

1655
01:21:27,606 --> 01:21:28,711
- Yeah it is.

1656
01:21:31,783 --> 01:21:34,406
But it's too late now, huh?

1657
01:21:34,441 --> 01:21:37,340
[melancholy music]

1658
01:21:39,964 --> 01:21:41,172
What?

1659
01:21:41,206 --> 01:21:44,347
- Well you see I just got back
from a quick run to Vegas.

1660
01:21:44,382 --> 01:21:47,488
This librarian who had a thing
for the Cirque du Soleil,

1661
01:21:47,523 --> 01:21:49,421
you know the dirty one?

1662
01:21:50,284 --> 01:21:54,392
You think I'm giving up this
easy on my Ma's meatballs?

1663
01:21:54,426 --> 01:21:57,913
I'm still running on Vegas
time, so this watch says

1664
01:21:57,947 --> 01:22:01,951
we still got 10 minutes
to get you back home.

1665
01:22:01,986 --> 01:22:02,952
[gasping]

1666
01:22:02,987 --> 01:22:05,748
What do you want for Christmas,
Sophie?

1667
01:22:05,782 --> 01:22:08,440
[bells ringing]

1668
01:22:34,294 --> 01:22:37,918
- All I want for
Christmas is my life back.

1669
01:22:43,510 --> 01:22:46,237
[ethereal music]

1670
01:22:51,518 --> 01:22:52,346
I'm home.

[gasping]

1672
01:22:55,453 --> 01:22:56,281
I'm home.

1673
01:22:58,697 --> 01:23:00,596
Is anybody here?

1674
01:23:00,630 --> 01:23:01,769
I'm up.

1675
01:23:01,804 --> 01:23:03,979
- Mom's awake, Mom's awake!

1676
01:23:04,013 --> 01:23:08,155
- Honey, you have no idea
how glad I am to see you.

1677
01:23:09,053 --> 01:23:10,744
- We got a puppy from Santa.

1678
01:23:10,778 --> 01:23:12,815
Mom did you see our new puppy?

1679
01:23:12,849 --> 01:23:14,023
[puppy barking]

1680
01:23:14,058 --> 01:23:16,129
His name's Joey Ramone.

1681
01:23:16,163 --> 01:23:17,337
Joey, come on.

1682
01:23:18,786 --> 01:23:20,616
- Joey Ramone?

1683
01:23:20,650 --> 01:23:21,548
- Joey!

1684
01:23:21,582 --> 01:23:23,343
[laughing]

1685
01:23:23,377 --> 01:23:24,896
- He's so cute.

1686
01:23:24,930 --> 01:23:25,897
Honey where's Daddy?

1687
01:23:25,931 --> 01:23:27,657
- He's in the kitchen.

1688
01:23:27,692 --> 01:23:28,486
- Lets go.

1689
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:31,282
[child laughing]

1690
01:23:32,628 --> 01:23:34,043
Honey!

1691
01:23:34,078 --> 01:23:36,080
- What are you doing up?

1692
01:23:37,426 --> 01:23:39,152
You are supposed to be resting.

1693
01:23:39,186 --> 01:23:41,775
You had a fever of 103.

1694
01:23:41,809 --> 01:23:43,949
- Oh my god how long was I out?

1695
01:23:43,984 --> 01:23:45,020
- A few days.

1696
01:23:45,054 --> 01:23:47,919
The doctor said it was acute
exhaustion.

1697
01:23:47,953 --> 01:23:49,610
- Wait, wait, what about
the presents and the food

1698
01:23:49,645 --> 01:23:50,646
and is my mother here--

1699
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:51,957
- Just don't worry about it.

1700
01:23:51,992 --> 01:23:53,890
We're doing a pot luck, we've
got everything under control.

1701
01:23:53,925 --> 01:23:55,858
Your sister's going to
bring those yams with the

1702
01:23:55,892 --> 01:23:58,447
disgusting little marshmallow
things.

1703
01:23:58,481 --> 01:24:00,380
So listen, hey hey hey.

1704
01:24:01,657 --> 01:24:02,968
Go back to bed.

1705
01:24:03,003 --> 01:24:07,076
I've got, I'm in charge, so go
on you little control freak.

1706
01:24:07,111 --> 01:24:08,457
- Oh my gosh go!

1707
01:24:10,010 --> 01:24:11,425
- No no no no no.

1708
01:24:15,291 --> 01:24:16,672
- Hey honey.

1709
01:24:16,706 --> 01:24:18,432
- Hi Mom, are you feeling
better?

1710
01:24:18,467 --> 01:24:20,158
- Yeah I am.

1711
01:24:20,193 --> 01:24:22,229
Look I'm really sorry
about missing your play.

1712
01:24:22,264 --> 01:24:23,230
- It's okay.

1713
01:24:23,265 --> 01:24:25,094
It was just some stupid drama
class thing.

1714
01:24:25,129 --> 01:24:26,130
- No it wasn't.

1715
01:24:26,164 --> 01:24:27,510
It was important and I
should have been there.

1716
01:24:27,545 --> 01:24:29,098
- It's okay Mom, really.

1717
01:24:29,133 --> 01:24:31,307
- Look, things are going to
be different from now on.

1718
01:24:31,342 --> 01:24:32,619
I promise.

1719
01:24:32,653 --> 01:24:34,069
I'm still going to forget a few
things

1720
01:24:34,103 --> 01:24:35,311
and I'm going to need your help
with that

1721
01:24:35,346 --> 01:24:38,280
but I'm going to try
to just, I don't know,

1722
01:24:38,314 --> 01:24:42,939
just be here with you and
not wish my life away.

1723
01:24:42,974 --> 01:24:45,321
- Mom, you are here.

1724
01:24:45,356 --> 01:24:46,426
- Yeah, I am.

1725
01:24:47,910 --> 01:24:50,637
- Okay who wants crispy
pancakes?

1726
01:24:51,569 --> 01:24:53,467
- Why do they smell like
meatballs?

1727
01:24:53,502 --> 01:24:56,401
Mom, do you smell meatballs?

1728
01:24:56,436 --> 01:24:58,507
- Yeah I smell meatballs.

1729
01:24:59,473 --> 01:25:01,613
- Mom, promise me you're not
going to be

1730
01:25:01,648 --> 01:25:04,133
one of those parents who quits
their job to stay at home

1731
01:25:04,168 --> 01:25:07,447
and then spends all their
time bugging their kids.

1732
01:25:07,481 --> 01:25:08,482
- I promise.

1733
01:25:13,453 --> 01:25:14,902
- No no no don't.

1734
01:25:23,635 --> 01:25:25,810
My 50 million dollar deal.

1735
01:25:28,675 --> 01:25:32,023
Margaret Lasky just gave that
land away.

1736
01:25:34,198 --> 01:25:37,373
- Well, take this up the
mountain Bob.

1737
01:25:39,099 --> 01:25:40,238
- Resignation?

1738
01:25:43,759 --> 01:25:46,313
[upbeat music]

1739
01:25:51,284 --> 01:25:53,217
- So how did Bob react?

1740
01:25:53,251 --> 01:25:54,735
- It was magnificent.

1741
01:25:54,770 --> 01:25:56,599
- I'm looking slimmer
these days don't you think?

1742
01:25:56,634 --> 01:25:58,187
- So who's our first client?

1743
01:25:58,222 --> 01:26:02,364
- Margareta DeSouza, some
big time real estate mogul.
