00:00:47,596 --> 00:00:49,662
- [girl] Beth, is it on?
- [Beth] We're rolling.

3
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:51,298
[girl] Places, guys.
This one's for real.

00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,769
"For centuries, the dark hand of Narash has
been spreading across the borderlands,

5
00:00:56,771 --> 00:00:59,573
ruling with blood
and necromancy.

6
00:00:59,575 --> 00:01:04,810
Are you the chosen one to challenge
him, to crush his bones into dust,

7
00:01:04,812 --> 00:01:07,747
and pry out his innards
with the tip of your sword?"

8
00:01:07,749 --> 00:01:09,548
- [Meg] Beth, film me.
- [hisses]

9
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,817
[Beth] Meg, you look like a boy.
[giggles]

10
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:14,554
- Yes! I am the...
- That's my part.

11
00:01:14,556 --> 00:01:16,555
I just wanted to make
sure you did it right.

12
00:01:16,557 --> 00:01:18,691
This is the pivotal point
for your character.

13
00:01:18,693 --> 00:01:20,659
- Just let me do it my way.
- But I'm the director.

14
00:01:20,661 --> 00:01:21,828
- [Beth] Hi, Amy.
- [giggles]

15
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,563
- [Meg] Okay, fine.
- [Beth] Try it again.

16
00:01:24,565 --> 00:01:30,003
"I am the rightful paladin. Tell me my path,
Lord Gillian, I shall fulfill my prophecy."

17
00:01:30,005 --> 00:01:34,039
"You must travel beyond
the catacombs of Eryx,

18
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:38,177
through the valley of Guell,
and climb the denizen steps

19
00:01:38,179 --> 00:01:41,114
where no human has dared
to venture."

20
00:01:41,116 --> 00:01:43,116
"Ever dared to venture, yet."

21
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:48,554
Uh, it's more like:
"Ever dared to venture, yet!"

22
00:01:48,556 --> 00:01:50,090
In order to continue,

23
00:01:50,092 --> 00:01:52,591
you must offer
sacrifice to Rian,

24
00:01:52,593 --> 00:01:55,661
a dark fairy
of the Killian order.

25
00:01:55,663 --> 00:01:58,265
"You must bring me
the dragon scale relic

26
00:01:58,267 --> 00:01:59,599
of the forgotten droids."

27
00:01:59,601 --> 00:02:01,134
- [giggles]
- Druids!

28
00:02:01,136 --> 00:02:02,903
Whatever.

29
00:02:02,905 --> 00:02:05,739
- "Do you accept?"
- "I am not afraid."

30
00:02:05,741 --> 00:02:09,743
She turned and said farewell,
floating bravely forth,

31
00:02:09,745 --> 00:02:13,515
on her long, unknown journey,
far away.

32
00:02:16,585 --> 00:02:18,718
- End book one.
- [girls clapping]

33
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,754
[Beth] Hey, Jo,
do the epilogue!

34
00:02:20,756 --> 00:02:22,622
But we've heard it
a million times!

35
00:02:22,624 --> 00:02:24,660
It's my favorite part.

36
00:02:25,727 --> 00:02:27,663
The people have spoken.

37
00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:30,162
[sighs]

38
00:02:30,164 --> 00:02:34,333
[Jo] It is not enough for the brave
heroine to desire greatness.

39
00:02:34,335 --> 00:02:40,040
No, even the lowliest serf in the
kingdom may desire greatness.

40
00:02:40,042 --> 00:02:43,944
For our heroine to succeed,
she must demand greatness.

41
00:02:43,946 --> 00:02:45,979
To snatch it
from the powers that be

42
00:02:45,981 --> 00:02:48,948
and wave it over the parapet
for all to see.

43
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,785
To prove
that she is their queen,

44
00:02:51,787 --> 00:02:56,926
and the magnificent rightful
heir to her birthright.

45
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,529
[sighs]

46
00:03:00,628 --> 00:03:03,997
Uh, well,
thank you, Josephine.

47
00:03:03,999 --> 00:03:04,932
Oh, it's just Jo.

48
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:08,100
You certainly gave us
an entertaining read.

49
00:03:08,102 --> 00:03:09,668
- [chuckles]
- [scoffs]

50
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,805
Uh, listen,
it's not my taste per se,

51
00:03:12,807 --> 00:03:15,909
but I could see how it
could appeal to others.

52
00:03:15,911 --> 00:03:20,613
- What are you going for? Young adult fantasy?
- Uh, no.

53
00:03:20,615 --> 00:03:23,083
It can't be Y.A.
There's no love story.

54
00:03:23,085 --> 00:03:25,618
- It's not a love story.
- Then it's definitely a pass for me.

55
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,755
- [Clarkson] Yeah, it's a pass for me as well.
- [Henry] Me too, sweetie.

56
00:03:28,757 --> 00:03:33,093
You have a very creative mind.

57
00:03:33,095 --> 00:03:37,297
But, there's something
missing in the authenticity.

58
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:38,765
I can't hear your voice.

59
00:03:38,767 --> 00:03:39,965
It's not about me!

60
00:03:39,967 --> 00:03:42,334
All the same,
it's still gonna be a pass.

61
00:03:42,336 --> 00:03:43,172
Professor?

62
00:03:47,008 --> 00:03:49,242
Yeah, it's a pass
from me as well.

63
00:03:49,244 --> 00:03:50,343
Thanks.

64
00:03:50,345 --> 00:03:52,678
No, thank you.

65
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,947
Really I...

66
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:58,851
I appreciate you judging
my artistic aptitude

67
00:03:58,853 --> 00:04:02,791
on three pages
of my 400-page novel.

68
00:04:05,661 --> 00:04:06,862
Thank you.

00:04:10,132 --> 00:04:13,333

Hurry up!
The lava's rising.

81
00:05:11,059 --> 00:05:13,259
[woman] Is there any way you could
give me a one-time extension?

82
00:05:13,261 --> 00:05:16,129
- I promise, it won't happen again.
- My earring!

83
00:05:16,131 --> 00:05:19,499
Leave it! No! She just
spontaneously combusted!

84
00:05:19,501 --> 00:05:21,234
- We have to move on.
- Oh, come on.

85
00:05:21,236 --> 00:05:22,335
Jo!

86
00:05:22,337 --> 00:05:23,936
She chose her fate.

87
00:05:23,938 --> 00:05:25,804
We are not
going without her.

88
00:05:25,806 --> 00:05:27,473
[woman] Is there any way
you could reverse the fee?

89
00:05:27,475 --> 00:05:29,475
- Apollyon!
- [woman] Yes?

90
00:05:29,477 --> 00:05:30,509
[girls calling]
Apollyon!

91
00:05:30,511 --> 00:05:32,345
[woman] I'm sorry.
Can you just hold?

92
00:05:32,347 --> 00:05:34,213
- [phone beeps]
- I am here!

93
00:05:34,215 --> 00:05:38,251
From whence come you,
and whither are you bound?

94
00:05:38,253 --> 00:05:41,121
We have traveled
from the city of desolation

95
00:05:41,123 --> 00:05:44,790
- through the fires of purgatory, fighting beasts of the night.
- [gasps]

96
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:49,732
- We seek access to the city of Zion.
- Ooh. Hmm.

97
00:05:51,099 --> 00:05:52,968
You may release
your burdens.

98
00:05:55,302 --> 00:06:00,073
But you must each sacrifice
one valuable to the altar.

99
00:06:00,075 --> 00:06:04,244
But choose carefully.
Be not selfish!

100
00:06:04,246 --> 00:06:08,381
Whatever you select
must be of great value.

101
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,986
Good. Yes.

102
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,121
- Hair?
- It's valuable to me.

103
00:06:15,123 --> 00:06:15,858
Hmm.

104
00:06:17,992 --> 00:06:20,195
Your castles await you.

105
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,997
- Go!
- [Jo] Except for Amy.

106
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,898
- [phone beeps]
- Oh.

107
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,999
- Hey!
- Oh. Ah.

108
00:06:27,001 --> 00:06:30,271
Hello? Thanks for holding.
I'm so sorry.

109
00:06:36,511 --> 00:06:37,477
Hey, let me in!

110
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:38,912
- [knocking]
- No! You cheated!

111
00:06:38,914 --> 00:06:40,345
You don't deserve
to be in the castle!

112
00:06:40,347 --> 00:06:42,381
- Just let her in.
- [Jo] She has to play by the rules!

113
00:06:42,383 --> 00:06:43,516
- [Amy knocking]
- It's just a game.

114
00:06:43,518 --> 00:06:45,888
- Let me in!
- [Jo] It's not a game to me!

115
00:06:46,987 --> 00:06:48,955
- Let me in!
- Let her in.

116
00:06:48,957 --> 00:06:51,523
- [sighs]
- All my sisters are allowed in my castle.

117
00:06:51,525 --> 00:06:53,228
[Meg] Mine too.

118
00:06:56,097 --> 00:06:58,100
- Oh, my goodness.
- This is so cool.

119
00:06:59,167 --> 00:07:00,035
Mine's pink!

120
00:07:03,003 --> 00:07:04,970
"Welcome to your castles
in the air.

121
00:07:04,972 --> 00:07:07,109
Fill them wisely.
Love Marmee."

122
00:07:12,179 --> 00:07:13,412
[gasps]

123
00:07:13,414 --> 00:07:17,917
- Jo, what's in your castle?
- [Jo] Well, I want a lot of things.

124
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,319
- I, Jo March...
- [older Jo] <i>I, Jo March...</i>

125
00:07:20,321 --> 00:07:25,290
I, Jo March... I'll get out of this
town and move to the big city.

126
00:07:25,292 --> 00:07:28,528
I, Jo March, will be a
very successful writer

127
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:32,131
and will buy a big house in the
city so we can all live together.

128
00:07:32,133 --> 00:07:34,199
[Meg] I don't want to
live with you forever!

129
00:07:34,201 --> 00:07:36,869
I want to get married
and have kids and...

130
00:07:36,871 --> 00:07:40,907
And have a nanny,
and a maid, and... a butler!

131
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:44,276
- [Jo] Amy, that's stupid.
- [Meg] Hey, you can't judge other people's castles.

132
00:07:44,278 --> 00:07:47,213
[Jo] Fine.
Then I change the rules of mine.

133
00:07:47,215 --> 00:07:49,448
Only Beth and I are
allowed in my castle.

134
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,884
[Amy] Hey!

135
00:07:50,886 --> 00:07:54,254
I, Jo March, will be
a very successful writer,

136
00:07:54,256 --> 00:07:56,122
and will visit
every single country

137
00:07:56,124 --> 00:07:57,924
and eat out
every single meal.

138
00:07:57,926 --> 00:08:03,028
Oh, and I will see every play and
musical and opera ever written.

139
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,564
Or will be written
ever.

140
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:06,435
[Beth]
I think that's too long.

141
00:08:08,102 --> 00:08:13,208
I, Jo March, will be a very
successful writer and will...

142
00:08:14,376 --> 00:08:16,878
do
all the things.

143
00:08:18,946 --> 00:08:20,415
[Amy] My turn.

144
00:08:22,316 --> 00:08:27,953
I, Amy March, will be...
a rich and famous painter

145
00:08:27,955 --> 00:08:30,355
so I can...

146
00:08:30,357 --> 00:08:33,325
buy whatever I want
and go wherever I want.

147
00:08:33,327 --> 00:08:34,928
[Beth giggles]
Amy.

148
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:38,997
I, Margaret March, will have
a family of my own,

149
00:08:38,999 --> 00:08:41,470
and, um, just be...

150
00:08:42,537 --> 00:08:45,139
well, happy.

151
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:47,075
[Jo] And?

152
00:08:48,409 --> 00:08:50,245
[Meg] And nothing.

153
00:08:51,345 --> 00:08:53,578
- <i>Beth?</i>
- [young Beth] <i>I, Elizabeth March...</i>

154
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,383
I, Elizabeth March...

155
00:08:57,018 --> 00:08:59,218
[laughs]
I don't know what to say.

156
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,923
[Jo] Just... think about what you
want to be when you grow up.

157
00:09:03,157 --> 00:09:06,291
[Beth]
Well, I think this is my castle.

158
00:09:06,293 --> 00:09:09,364
- The attic?
- Just being here with all of you.

159
00:09:10,465 --> 00:09:12,397
[Jo] Okay, Beth.

160
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,166
Yeah, that's really sweet.
We'll take it.

161
00:09:14,168 --> 00:09:16,435
- [giggling]
- Let's make an oath.

162
00:09:16,437 --> 00:09:17,469
- Okay.
- Yeah.

163
00:09:17,471 --> 00:09:18,941
[Jo] All right.

164
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:22,311
[sighs]

165
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:27,181
To always help each other
reach our castles.

166
00:09:28,048 --> 00:09:29,484
No matter
where they may be.

167
00:09:31,652 --> 00:09:32,488
[sighs]

168
00:09:34,221 --> 00:09:36,457
[kisses]

169
00:09:40,595 --> 00:09:42,064
[kisses]

170
00:09:45,332 --> 00:09:47,733
- [men murmuring]
- [Freddy] "Everybody gets a prize" mentality.

171
00:09:47,735 --> 00:09:50,269
- [Henry] My principles could be...
- [Freddy] No. Not everybody wins.

172
00:09:50,271 --> 00:09:53,039
Hey, excuse me!
Excuse me.

173
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,272
- Professor Bhaer.
- Oh, dear.

174
00:09:54,274 --> 00:09:55,040
Hey!

175
00:09:55,042 --> 00:09:57,275
- It's dragon lady.
- Professor Bhaer!

176
00:09:57,277 --> 00:09:59,112
- Good luck with that.
- I need to talk to you.

177
00:09:59,114 --> 00:10:00,713
Just Jo, with the
fantasy novel, right?

178
00:10:00,715 --> 00:10:04,150
It's a high-fantasy
mythopoeic fable.

179
00:10:04,152 --> 00:10:06,352
Sorry I'm not more
familiar with that genre.

180
00:10:06,354 --> 00:10:09,521
Yeah, neither was your panel
of patriarchs in there.

181
00:10:09,523 --> 00:10:12,025
Which, you know, I might expect
from some of those hacks,

182
00:10:12,027 --> 00:10:13,659
but not from you.

183
00:10:13,661 --> 00:10:15,328
Not from someone
with your résumé.

184
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,597
It doesn't matter.
I will find my audience,

185
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:22,200
no thanks to Columbia or Hooton
Muffin or however you say it.

186
00:10:22,202 --> 00:10:26,271
- I'm sure you will.
- You probably didn't even understand that the protagonist

187
00:10:26,273 --> 00:10:29,174
- is actually a girl who dresses up as a boy.
- I didn't.

188
00:10:29,176 --> 00:10:31,444
And when I was growing up,
I dressed up as a boy.

189
00:10:31,446 --> 00:10:35,113
I was inspired by my
"authentic self," you see?

190
00:10:35,115 --> 00:10:39,484
I really think you would have understood
that and possibly even enjoyed it a little,

191
00:10:39,486 --> 00:10:42,554
had you heard more than
a measly three-minute reading

192
00:10:42,556 --> 00:10:45,223
in a synthetic,
almost hostile environment,

193
00:10:45,225 --> 00:10:49,261
where the critiques were really more
about subjective capitalistic conjecture

194
00:10:49,263 --> 00:10:52,198
than a chance for writers
to be discovered.

195
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,369
I'd be happy to read
more of your novel.

196
00:10:54,835 --> 00:10:56,169
You would?

197
00:10:56,171 --> 00:10:58,404
Oh, yes! Thank you!

198
00:10:58,406 --> 00:11:01,207
I've been wanting anyone...
everyone... to read it.

199
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:02,275
Besides my sister.

200
00:11:02,277 --> 00:11:04,146
Freddy, by the way.
Freddy Bhaer.

201
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,214
Here. Contact info,
title page.

202
00:11:09,216 --> 00:11:10,817
E-mail would have been fine.

203
00:11:10,819 --> 00:11:12,418
No.

204
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,655
You have to hold the words,
let them seep into your skin.

205
00:11:16,657 --> 00:11:18,757
All right.

206
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:21,229
I'll be expecting your call.

207
00:11:23,764 --> 00:11:24,600
[sighs]

208
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,434
[horns honking]

209
00:11:28,436 --> 00:11:32,137
- [machine beeps]
- <i>Hey, it's Freddy. I'm just, uh, checking in.</i>

210
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:35,474
<i>I haven't heard from you. I know
that notes can be overwhelming.</i>

211
00:11:35,476 --> 00:11:37,175
<i>Keep your chin up.</i>

212
00:11:37,177 --> 00:11:39,478
- <i>Let me know when you have another draft.</i>
- [beeps]

213
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,583
[vibrating]

214
00:11:45,152 --> 00:11:49,457
Josephine? Good heavens, child. It
smells like a Turkish bath in here.

215
00:11:50,457 --> 00:11:51,626
[sighs]

216
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:57,796
If you're going to quarantine yourself
in this room for weeks on end,

217
00:11:57,798 --> 00:11:59,431
the least you could do
is crack a window.

218
00:11:59,433 --> 00:12:01,467
The least you could do
is knock.

219
00:12:01,469 --> 00:12:04,402
Oh, I'm your employer,
and I'm supposed to knock?

220
00:12:04,404 --> 00:12:06,572
How very millennial of you.

221
00:12:06,574 --> 00:12:08,440
Dinner's at 6:00.

222
00:12:08,442 --> 00:12:10,476
- I don't want her to starve
- [growls]

223
00:12:10,478 --> 00:12:13,346
while you escape into
your Neverwood Forest

224
00:12:13,348 --> 00:12:15,247
or whatever
you're scribbling about.

225
00:12:15,249 --> 00:12:17,382
I will do my best.

226
00:12:17,384 --> 00:12:19,285
Well, I sure hope
that's enough.

227
00:12:19,287 --> 00:12:21,355
Love you too,
Aunt March.

228
00:12:27,928 --> 00:12:30,231
[sighs]

229
00:12:33,868 --> 00:12:37,236
<i>Honey, it's Mom, just wanting
to know how your meetings went.</i>

230
00:12:37,238 --> 00:12:42,942
<i>So exciting. I bet they were busy fighting over
who gets to publish Concord's own Jo March.</i>

231
00:12:42,944 --> 00:12:44,577
[chuckles] <i>Anyway, I
know you're busy,</i>

232
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:48,383
<i>but just check in and let us know when
you're coming home for Christm...</i> [beeps]

233
00:12:49,584 --> 00:12:52,818
[Amy] This is going to be
the worst Christmas ever.

234
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,621
All my friends at school
get a whole pile of presents,

235
00:12:55,623 --> 00:12:57,593
and we get nothing.

236
00:12:59,561 --> 00:13:03,828
Well, we each get one gift, and
that's more than most people get.

237
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,564
You want to know
what I asked for?

238
00:13:05,566 --> 00:13:08,200
Do not say a bra.

239
00:13:08,202 --> 00:13:09,901
New paintbrushes!

240
00:13:09,903 --> 00:13:11,539
[Jo] There he is again!

241
00:13:14,975 --> 00:13:19,280
[wind howling]

242
00:13:20,648 --> 00:13:22,518
[Meg] I heard he just
moved here from Europe.

243
00:13:23,585 --> 00:13:26,618
Maybe he was forced
to move here,

244
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,290
after stowing away on
the Trans-Siberian railroad.

245
00:13:30,457 --> 00:13:33,227
Marmee said his parents
just died in a car accident.

246
00:13:33,894 --> 00:13:34,993
He doesn't
have any siblings,

247
00:13:34,995 --> 00:13:39,534
- so now he has to live with his grandfather.
- How sad.

248
00:13:43,437 --> 00:13:45,306
He's kind of cute, though.

249
00:13:46,441 --> 00:13:48,607
I mean,
I guess, for an old guy.

250
00:13:48,609 --> 00:13:50,809
[laughing]

251
00:13:50,811 --> 00:13:54,247
I don't think I could
ever live in that creepy house.

252
00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:55,747
Mr. Laurence is so scary.

253
00:13:55,749 --> 00:14:00,019
Oh, maybe Mr. Laurence
isn't his grandfather.

254
00:14:00,021 --> 00:14:02,288
He's the new kid's
vampire mentor,

255
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:05,290
and he's trying to tame
his ravishing appetite.

256
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:08,426
- Wait, that is really good.
- [chuckles]

257
00:14:08,428 --> 00:14:09,728
We should do something
nice for them.

258
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,766
- Maybe we could bake them something.
- [Amy] Yes!

259
00:14:14,002 --> 00:14:15,734
[gasps]

260
00:14:15,736 --> 00:14:20,673
[on radio]
<i>♪ Angels we have heard on high ♪</i>

261
00:14:20,675 --> 00:14:22,275
Ooh.

262
00:14:22,277 --> 00:14:24,843
Amy, let's wait till
everyone gets here, okay?

263
00:14:24,845 --> 00:14:26,344
But I'm starving!

264
00:14:26,346 --> 00:14:29,015
You continue to use
that word incorrectly.

265
00:14:29,017 --> 00:14:31,383
- You know what I mean.
- Actually, I don't.

266
00:14:31,385 --> 00:14:32,550
- Shut up, Jo.
- [Marmee] Good morning!

267
00:14:32,552 --> 00:14:35,320
Oh, it smells like Christmas
in here.

268
00:14:35,322 --> 00:14:36,822
- You're back!
- How was the shelter?

269
00:14:36,824 --> 00:14:38,991
- [Marmee] Well...
- There were so many people there,

270
00:14:38,993 --> 00:14:41,327
we didn't have enough
food for everyone.

271
00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:43,996
See Amy? Those
people <i>are</i> starving.

272
00:14:43,998 --> 00:14:46,899
But not if
they like cupcakes.

273
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:49,334
- Oh!
- I'll grab my costumes.

274
00:14:49,336 --> 00:14:51,036
We can do
the nativity musical!

275
00:14:51,038 --> 00:14:54,842
Oh! No, no, no, no, no.
Not the cupcakes!

276
00:14:56,043 --> 00:14:58,444
Can we just be
a normal family

277
00:14:58,446 --> 00:15:01,546
and eat breakfast
and open presents at home?

278
00:15:01,548 --> 00:15:03,518
- [knocks]
- I'll get that.

279
00:15:04,951 --> 00:15:07,053
- Oh, hi.
- [Meg] Hi.

280
00:15:07,055 --> 00:15:08,688
- Hey, hi.
- Hi.

281
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:09,954
- Oh!
- I think this one's yours.

282
00:15:09,956 --> 00:15:11,357
Yeah.

283
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,992
- Thank you so much.
- There you go.

284
00:15:12,994 --> 00:15:14,559
Fat ol' Goob
is always running away.

285
00:15:14,561 --> 00:15:17,096
- Yeah.
- Dove? Where are you?

286
00:15:17,098 --> 00:15:18,930
Dove? I thought
you called him Goob.

287
00:15:18,932 --> 00:15:20,833
Oh, I'm Dove.
I mean, I'm Meg.

288
00:15:20,835 --> 00:15:23,468
But my family...
That's what they call me.

289
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,670
I'm John Brooke. I live next
door with the Laurences.

290
00:15:25,672 --> 00:15:27,906
- Oh.
- You don't look like a Laurence.

291
00:15:27,908 --> 00:15:31,711
- This is my sister, Jo.
- Yeah, I'm just a family friend of the Laurences.

292
00:15:31,713 --> 00:15:36,848
Mr. Laurence hired me to tutor his
grandson. Math, music and whatever else.

293
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:39,852
- That's nice.
- So the new kid has a manny.

294
00:15:39,854 --> 00:15:41,853
Nope. Just a tutor.

295
00:15:41,855 --> 00:15:43,421
Right. Okay, yeah.

296
00:15:43,423 --> 00:15:45,524
Well, uh, we have to go
help some poor people.

297
00:15:45,526 --> 00:15:47,126
- Oh.
- So we'll catch you later.

298
00:15:47,128 --> 00:15:48,093
Merry Christmas.

299
00:15:48,095 --> 00:15:49,962
- Mm, bye!
- Merry Christmas.

300
00:15:49,964 --> 00:15:52,964
- [man] <i>Goob, buddy. Get off the computer.</i>
- [Meg] Oops, sorry, Dad.

301
00:15:52,966 --> 00:15:54,900
- <i>Rascal.</i>
- [meows]

302
00:15:54,902 --> 00:15:58,136
- Come here, Goob.
- <i>What do you got for me, Amy?</i>

303
00:15:58,138 --> 00:16:01,506
Okay. This one
is Marmee's favorite.

304
00:16:01,508 --> 00:16:04,443
- <i>Wow.</i>
- She says it's very "ethetically" pleasing.

305
00:16:04,445 --> 00:16:06,846
- Aesthetically.
- Aesthetically. [chuckles]

306
00:16:06,848 --> 00:16:10,448
<i>Well done. Amy, that's beautiful.
You're getting so good!</i>

307
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:12,751
[chuckles]
Thank you.

308
00:16:12,753 --> 00:16:15,420
- Did I show you this one?
- No. No, no, no. Your time is up!

309
00:16:15,422 --> 00:16:16,421
- Jo.
- No.

310
00:16:16,423 --> 00:16:17,589
Come on!
Time is up!

311
00:16:17,591 --> 00:16:18,958
- Move.
- <i>Hey, you guys.</i>

312
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,458
Thank you.

313
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,127
Hi, Dad.
Okay, really quick question.

314
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:26,131
Uh, when you first cut into a
liver, is the blood that seeps out,

315
00:16:26,133 --> 00:16:28,467
is it more crimson or maroon?

316
00:16:28,469 --> 00:16:30,535
<i>Writing a murder mystery,
are we?</i>

317
00:16:30,537 --> 00:16:34,939
- No, it's a post-apocalyptic zombie thriller.
- <i>Whoa.</i>

318
00:16:34,941 --> 00:16:38,777
<i>Uh, crimson, I would say.
But I only operate on humans.</i>

319
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:41,947
- <i>So I don't really know about zombie blood.</i>
- Okay. Thank you.

320
00:16:41,949 --> 00:16:44,650
<i>All right, listen up, girls.
I only have a minute left.</i>

321
00:16:44,652 --> 00:16:47,051
<i>Jo, I'm going to put you
in charge of the club this year.</i>

322
00:16:47,053 --> 00:16:48,487
<i>So here's your marching orders.</i>

323
00:16:48,489 --> 00:16:50,823
[clears throat]

324
00:16:50,825 --> 00:16:54,193
<i>Your first assignment of the year will
be to write your grievances every week</i>

325
00:16:54,195 --> 00:16:56,761
<i>and come up with a plan
as to how to fix them.</i>

326
00:16:56,763 --> 00:17:00,735
<i>That way, you can be strong,
kind, independent little women</i>

327
00:17:01,469 --> 00:17:02,535
<i>like your mother.</i>

328
00:17:02,537 --> 00:17:05,937
- <i>Is that clear?</i>
- Sir, yes, sir!

329
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:07,842
<i>Good. At ease, soldiers.</i>

330
00:17:09,176 --> 00:17:10,376
<i>I love you guys so much.</i>

331
00:17:10,378 --> 00:17:13,511
- <i>Hey, where's my beautiful Marmee?</i>
- Marmee!

332
00:17:13,513 --> 00:17:16,682
- <i>I need to see her one more time.</i>
- Hi.

333
00:17:16,684 --> 00:17:19,684
<i>Ah, there she is.
Hi, Marmee.</i>

334
00:17:19,686 --> 00:17:22,620
- <i>I love you so much.</i>
- [girls] Love you, Dad!

335
00:17:22,622 --> 00:17:24,790
<i>Merry Christmas, you guys.
I miss you so much.</i>

336
00:17:24,792 --> 00:17:27,460
<i>I'll think about you every day.
I promise.</i>

337
00:17:27,462 --> 00:17:29,094
[all]
Merry Christmas, Dad!

338
00:17:29,096 --> 00:17:31,864
- <i>Take care of your mom. I love you.</i>
- [Meg] Always.

339
00:17:31,866 --> 00:17:32,734
<i>Bye.</i>

340
00:17:38,939 --> 00:17:41,008
[all sigh]

341
00:17:44,544 --> 00:17:49,514
<i>Fifteen! Sixteen! Seventeen!</i>

342
00:17:49,516 --> 00:17:51,183
Say it with me, ladies!

343
00:17:51,185 --> 00:17:56,821
[all]
Eighteen! Nineteen! Twenty!

344
00:17:56,823 --> 00:18:00,494
All right. [blows whistle]
Fall in, soldiers!

345
00:18:02,964 --> 00:18:05,530
As Staff Sergeant
of the Pickwick Club,

346
00:18:05,532 --> 00:18:08,733
I request a read of the earthly
grievances of each of our members

347
00:18:08,735 --> 00:18:10,839
as requested
by our commander-in-chief.

348
00:18:14,574 --> 00:18:17,009
- Staff Sergeant Snodgrass.
- [clears throat]

349
00:18:17,011 --> 00:18:20,512
Your clothes and notebooks are everywhere
and when asked to clean it up,

350
00:18:20,514 --> 00:18:23,048
you launched an airborne Cabbage
Patch at Private Winkle's head!

351
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:24,849
You're lucky
that you missed.

352
00:18:24,851 --> 00:18:27,086
With all due respect,
who's the lucky one?

353
00:18:27,088 --> 00:18:30,591
- Soldier...
- Apologies, Private. Duly noted.

354
00:18:32,859 --> 00:18:35,793
- [clears throat]
- Corporal Tupman.

355
00:18:35,795 --> 00:18:38,630
Though we love
your feline companion,

356
00:18:38,632 --> 00:18:41,799
we request that you fulfill
your kitty litter duties

357
00:18:41,801 --> 00:18:46,004
and pick up the litter box since the stench
is considered to be highly offensive.

358
00:18:46,006 --> 00:18:47,508
Can do, sir.

359
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:55,813
Private Winkle. It has been reported
that on multiple occasions,

360
00:18:55,815 --> 00:18:58,951
you have stolen toilet paper
out of the latrine,

361
00:18:58,953 --> 00:19:02,053
with the express purpose
of stuffing your shirt.

362
00:19:02,055 --> 00:19:03,155
- [giggles]
- You are so mean!

363
00:19:03,157 --> 00:19:05,057
On the contrary.

364
00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:09,294
We wish only to help you enjoy
your youthful freedom,

365
00:19:09,296 --> 00:19:14,332
for you will soon come to know the cumbersome
and unwieldy nature of a full chest.

366
00:19:14,334 --> 00:19:16,702
- Like you would know.
- Private Winkle!

367
00:19:16,704 --> 00:19:18,169
[sighs, clears throat]

368
00:19:18,171 --> 00:19:20,271
General Pickwick!

369
00:19:20,273 --> 00:19:23,876
It has been noted that you have
not visited the shelter all week

370
00:19:23,878 --> 00:19:27,245
because of frequent flirtations
with the manny.

371
00:19:27,247 --> 00:19:29,280
So you must go twice
next week.

372
00:19:29,282 --> 00:19:30,886
Sir, yes, sir.

373
00:19:33,721 --> 00:19:38,123
- [Aunt March] Josephine, what on earth is going on here?
- [dog whining]

374
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:42,828
Wha... Sorry. I'm... I'm just, uh... trying
to lay everything out, see everything.

375
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,629
I'm not talking about
your little story.

376
00:19:44,631 --> 00:19:48,200
I'm talking about the fact that
Katinka's water bowl is bone dry,

377
00:19:48,202 --> 00:19:49,335
and she pooped
in the entryway.

378
00:19:49,337 --> 00:19:53,038
- Serious? I just took her out.
- When? Last Christmas?

379
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,976
- What am I paying you for?
- I'm sorry my life doesn't revolve around your dog.

380
00:19:57,978 --> 00:20:01,012
Well, what does it revolve
around, exactly? Hmm?

381
00:20:01,014 --> 00:20:05,020
Trolls? Dragons?
Cross-dressing pirates?

382
00:20:06,853 --> 00:20:09,221
I don't mean
to hurt your feelings.

383
00:20:09,223 --> 00:20:11,255
I'm just worried
about you is all.

384
00:20:11,257 --> 00:20:15,194
Is this really the life you want?
The life of... insecurity?

385
00:20:15,196 --> 00:20:16,761
Yes.

386
00:20:16,763 --> 00:20:19,164
What if the professor
doesn't like this version

387
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,098
or the next?

388
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,734
- He will.
- I hate to see you working so hard

389
00:20:22,736 --> 00:20:24,703
when it could all
come to nothing.

390
00:20:24,705 --> 00:20:27,639
There's no shame
in changing your mind.

391
00:20:27,641 --> 00:20:30,709
You're still...
youngish.

392
00:20:30,711 --> 00:20:34,178
It's not too late to pursue something
with a little more promise in it.

393
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:38,049
I know it doesn't look
like much right now,

394
00:20:38,051 --> 00:20:40,251
but you are going to be sorry
you ever doubted me.

395
00:20:40,253 --> 00:20:41,990
I certainly hope so.

396
00:20:45,392 --> 00:20:47,628
Just think about a
plan "B." [kisses]

397
00:20:56,771 --> 00:20:59,905
- I knew it. You hate the new beginning.
- No.

398
00:20:59,907 --> 00:21:02,875
I liked it.
A lot, actually.

399
00:21:02,877 --> 00:21:05,180
But then I've always been a
fan of <i>A Wrinkle in Time.</i>

400
00:21:06,379 --> 00:21:09,848
I am trying to get
inspired by the greats.

401
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,817
Isn't that what artists do?

402
00:21:11,819 --> 00:21:13,018
Yes.

403
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,154
And then they tell
their own stories.

404
00:21:15,156 --> 00:21:17,955
- Was it at least better than the last time you read it?
- It was.

405
00:21:17,957 --> 00:21:19,660
But...

406
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,895
Am I a hopeless case?

407
00:21:22,897 --> 00:21:26,098
Please just tell me now.
Save me the heartache.

408
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,901
You know, there are
other things I could do.

409
00:21:28,903 --> 00:21:31,436
I do have
marketable skills.

410
00:21:31,438 --> 00:21:34,306
I could be a nanny
till the day I croak.

411
00:21:34,308 --> 00:21:39,778
I love books. I-I should be
an old spinster librarian

412
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,815
who reads saucy romance
novels under her desk.

413
00:21:42,817 --> 00:21:44,051
I'm sure you'll
find time for both.

414
00:21:45,218 --> 00:21:46,085
You are not helping!

415
00:21:46,087 --> 00:21:49,954
I'm not your therapist.
I'm your editor.

416
00:21:49,956 --> 00:21:51,824
I'm not going to pity an artist
for taking their stripes.

417
00:21:51,826 --> 00:21:55,094
You signed up for this struggle the
moment you called yourself a writer.

418
00:21:55,096 --> 00:21:58,030
I have a feeling you'd
be bored with anything less.

419
00:21:58,032 --> 00:22:02,334
[sighs] You're good, Jo.
You're a good writer.

420
00:22:02,336 --> 00:22:05,771
But now that I've gotten
to know you, as a person,

421
00:22:05,773 --> 00:22:08,072
you are far more interesting
than what you write.

422
00:22:08,074 --> 00:22:11,011
I want to be reading...
more of this.

423
00:22:13,214 --> 00:22:14,480
More of you.

424
00:22:14,482 --> 00:22:16,084
Me?

425
00:22:16,817 --> 00:22:19,417
I am not
interesting!

426
00:22:19,419 --> 00:22:20,586
Hell,
I'm 29 years old.

427
00:22:20,588 --> 00:22:23,888
And I live alone in Queens while
I work for my great aunt.

428
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:25,257
I still haven't been to Europe.

429
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:27,859
I haven't been marooned
on a desert island.

430
00:22:27,861 --> 00:22:30,796
I haven't been falsely
accused of murder.

431
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:32,865
I haven't even been
a victim of identify theft!

432
00:22:32,867 --> 00:22:36,801
If... If my younger self
could see me now,

433
00:22:36,803 --> 00:22:41,875
she'd straight up join a nunnery because
at least then her life would have purpose.

434
00:22:43,144 --> 00:22:47,011
Actually,
that is not a bad idea.

435
00:22:47,013 --> 00:22:49,147
Do nuns take old people
like me?

436
00:22:49,149 --> 00:22:50,317
See? More of this.

437
00:22:52,253 --> 00:22:53,286
Where are you going?

438
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:56,053
Thanks to you, I have a
whole new draft to start.

439
00:22:56,055 --> 00:22:59,424
We could talk about something else. It
doesn't always have to be about your work.

440
00:22:59,426 --> 00:23:01,059
I don't have time
to sit and chat.

441
00:23:01,061 --> 00:23:03,828
If my muse
isn't going to visit me,

442
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:08,802
- I am going to find her and knock her dumb door down.
- [ladder rattles]

443
00:23:09,403 --> 00:23:11,537
Maybe I can help.

444
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:13,405
- ['50s rock]
- [Amy] You guys...

445
00:23:13,407 --> 00:23:15,339
My nose won't stop growing!

446
00:23:15,341 --> 00:23:18,810
- I need a nose job.
- Take that ridiculous thing off.

447
00:23:18,812 --> 00:23:21,879
You don't know what it's like to have
everyone else make fun of your nose.

448
00:23:21,881 --> 00:23:26,151
What is it gonna be like when you cut off
your circulation and your nose falls off?

449
00:23:26,153 --> 00:23:28,419
- You'd look like Voldemort.
- [Jo] Oh! That would be awesome.

450
00:23:28,421 --> 00:23:32,124
- [chuckles]
- Why can't I go to the New Year's Eve party?

451
00:23:32,126 --> 00:23:34,158
You can go to all the parties
you want when you're older.

452
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:38,096
For now, you can stay home and watch
the ball drop with Marmee and Beth.

453
00:23:38,098 --> 00:23:41,332
- Does that sound like any fun to you?
- Yes.

454
00:23:41,334 --> 00:23:43,100
It's not.
I'm the worst.

455
00:23:43,102 --> 00:23:44,903
I always fall asleep
before midnight.

456
00:23:44,905 --> 00:23:49,407
Yeah! You see what I mean?
Beth is so boring!

457
00:23:49,409 --> 00:23:52,376
And I could care less
about watching a ball drop.

458
00:23:52,378 --> 00:23:54,546
- [Beth] Couldn't care less.
- What's the difference?

459
00:23:54,548 --> 00:23:58,416
Well, if you could care less, that means you
care a little bit about the ball dropping.

460
00:23:58,418 --> 00:24:01,319
- I don't.
- Okay, look. I think you're lucky.

461
00:24:01,321 --> 00:24:04,056
I would rather pass a kidney stone
than go to this freakin' party.

462
00:24:04,058 --> 00:24:06,023
- You have to come with me. You promised.
- I'll go!

463
00:24:06,025 --> 00:24:08,527
[all]
You're too young!

464
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:12,231
Can I at least
pick out your outfit?

465
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:13,866
No, I'm wearing this.

466
00:24:13,868 --> 00:24:15,934
[Amy scoffs]
You'll never get a boyfriend.

467
00:24:15,936 --> 00:24:17,935
- That's the plan.
- [hissing]

468
00:24:17,937 --> 00:24:21,943
- I don't want a boyfriend. Boys are gross. I...
- What's that smell?

469
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:23,908
[gasps]
Jo!

470
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:27,613
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm sorry! You should have never let me do this!

471
00:24:27,615 --> 00:24:31,082
- Meg, Meg, Meg.
- [Beth] Say "sorry"!

472
00:24:31,084 --> 00:24:33,388
[Amy] You can just cover
it up with a headband.

473
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:39,023
You still look
so pretty.

474
00:24:39,025 --> 00:24:40,524
It's not that bad,
is it?

475
00:24:40,526 --> 00:24:42,296
- [all] No.
- [Amy] Not at all.

476
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,303
I don't like looking at
myself in the mirror.

477
00:24:50,404 --> 00:24:51,239
Me neither.

478
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:53,571
You get used to it.

479
00:24:53,573 --> 00:24:56,575
Jo, why don't you wear one too?
You can match Meg.

480
00:24:56,577 --> 00:24:58,944
I'm not wearing
a stupid headband.

481
00:24:58,946 --> 00:25:03,915
You don't even like Sally Moffat, and
her, like, giggly little brat pack.

482
00:25:03,917 --> 00:25:07,051
- They're not that bad.
- They talk about the stupidest things.

483
00:25:07,053 --> 00:25:09,421
And her brother always
gives me the weirdest looks.

484
00:25:09,423 --> 00:25:12,026
Let's go get pizza instead
and say that we didn't.

485
00:25:13,694 --> 00:25:15,260
Jo, listen.

486
00:25:15,262 --> 00:25:18,131
I'm sick of being the weird
home-schooled sisters.

487
00:25:20,301 --> 00:25:24,302
I want to make friends and go to
parties and talk to guys our own age.

488
00:25:24,304 --> 00:25:26,006
Why?

489
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,307
Because I just do!

490
00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:29,207
[sighs]

491
00:25:29,209 --> 00:25:31,879
And I really need
you to be my wing woman.

492
00:25:35,014 --> 00:25:38,151
[sighs] Wing woman
reporting for duty.

493
00:25:38,686 --> 00:25:40,219
[squeals]

494
00:25:40,221 --> 00:25:43,422
[hip-hop] <i>♪ It's Saturday night
And I'm feeling real good ♪</i>

495
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:46,157
I am so glad you're here.

496
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,297
I have somebody that I have been

00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:11,195
Further, I believe this soldier will
add a unique voice to the platoon.

665
00:34:11,197 --> 00:34:12,663
[all]
Who?

666
00:34:12,665 --> 00:34:16,867
I nominate
Mr. Laurie Laurence.

667
00:34:16,869 --> 00:34:20,871
- Mm-hmm.
- No! No, no, no. That would be so embarrassing!

668
00:34:20,873 --> 00:34:23,208
I agree with Amy.
I mean, Private Winkle.

669
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:24,275
He would just make fun of us.

670
00:34:24,277 --> 00:34:28,813
I give my word, as a soldier,
and as Staff Sergeant

671
00:34:28,815 --> 00:34:32,916
that he will not make fun of
our grievances or our oaths.

672
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:35,954
He wants nothing more than
to be a full part of the PC!

673
00:34:35,956 --> 00:34:38,857
He's like our brother!
Guys, we have to do it!

674
00:34:38,859 --> 00:34:41,960
- What if he tells Brooke?
- I promise I won't tell a soul!

675
00:34:41,962 --> 00:34:43,895
- Traitor!
- [Meg] You've been in there the whole time?

676
00:34:43,897 --> 00:34:46,063
- I hardly heard anything.
- You heard everything!

677
00:34:46,065 --> 00:34:50,567
My fellow comrades. I come to you
as a lowly Private First Class!

678
00:34:50,569 --> 00:34:53,570
A faithful friend
and a keeper of secrets.

679
00:34:53,572 --> 00:34:57,478
As a token of my appreciation for your
consideration, I have brought you this.

680
00:35:03,049 --> 00:35:04,616
Whoa.

681
00:35:04,618 --> 00:35:07,619
[Meg] What is it? A birdhouse?

682
00:35:07,621 --> 00:35:11,088
- What's it for?
- Every club needs a secret mailbox.

683
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:15,659
To keep our correspondence safely in
the hedge between our two nations.

684
00:35:15,661 --> 00:35:20,067
This one is for secrets,
never to be told.

685
00:35:24,904 --> 00:35:26,040
An alliance then?

686
00:35:27,907 --> 00:35:29,873
Well, then, Private.

687
00:35:29,875 --> 00:35:31,078
As General, I say...

688
00:35:32,244 --> 00:35:34,514
welcome
to the Pickwick Club.

689
00:35:35,147 --> 00:35:37,648
- [exhales]
- Yes!

690
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:40,217
[girl]
Your sister's really not coming?

691
00:35:40,219 --> 00:35:43,755
She said she's not interested
in "primitive rituals."

692
00:35:43,757 --> 00:35:46,891
Tonight is going to be
anything but primitive.

693
00:35:46,893 --> 00:35:49,594
Oh!
Your step-mom is the best!

694
00:35:49,596 --> 00:35:51,098
I know, right?

695
00:35:53,299 --> 00:35:55,632
That's a cute little dress.

696
00:35:55,634 --> 00:35:58,538
- It was my grandma's.
- How couture.

697
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:01,940
Just throwing this
out there.

698
00:36:01,942 --> 00:36:06,679
I think I might have something
a little bit more flattering.

699
00:36:07,913 --> 00:36:09,646
Totally goes with our color
scheme, don't you think?

700
00:36:09,648 --> 00:36:10,815
- Um...
- Here.

701
00:36:10,817 --> 00:36:12,250
You definitely have
the body for it.

702
00:36:12,252 --> 00:36:14,918
Yes, I would kill
for that stomach.

703
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,788
- Really?
- Face it, Meg. You're hot.

704
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:19,257
- Everyone knows you're hot.
- Especially Brian.

705
00:36:19,259 --> 00:36:20,991
I heard he was dating
Miss Cape Cod.

706
00:36:20,993 --> 00:36:23,563
Well, here's to
the best prom ever!

I'm gonna go dance

- Where are we going?
- It's a surprise.

730
00:37:51,985 --> 00:37:55,386
Sorry. It's...
stuffy up there.

731
00:37:55,388 --> 00:37:57,422
We're in a basement.

732
00:37:57,424 --> 00:37:59,994
- Oh! [giggles]
- [laughs]

733
00:38:01,027 --> 00:38:03,427

00:38:05,799 --> 00:38:07,799
[clears throat]
That's gross.

736
00:38:07,801 --> 00:38:11,038
That's Jäger.
It's an acquired taste.

737
00:38:13,306 --> 00:38:15,009
Maybe this will help.

738
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:19,212
[Laurie] Meg?

739
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,148
What are you doing here?

740
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:27,921
Jo said you might need a
"wing woman" or wingman.

741
00:38:28,388 --> 00:38:29,922
I don't.

742
00:38:31,891 --> 00:38:33,159
Okay.

743
00:38:36,795 --> 00:38:38,931
[scoffs]
What's with Willy Wonka?

744
00:38:40,165 --> 00:38:42,201
[sighs]
Nothing.

745
00:38:56,348 --> 00:38:58,382
[sucking]

746
00:38:58,384 --> 00:39:01,284
I'm sorry.
I can't do this.

747
00:39:01,286 --> 00:39:03,156
[sighs]
What's the problem?

748
00:39:04,223 --> 00:39:06,192
I don't want to do this.

749
00:39:07,092 --> 00:39:08,458
[sighs]

750
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:11,964
Fine. There's plenty
other girls that do.

751
00:39:29,549 --> 00:39:31,752
[sighs]

752
00:39:37,389 --> 00:39:40,224

[John Brooke]
Meg!

754
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:45,862
Laurie send you?

755
00:39:45,864 --> 00:39:47,767
I thought you might
need a ride.

756
00:39:48,433 --> 00:39:49,869
Well, I don't.

757
00:39:52,272 --> 00:39:53,206
Hungry?

758
00:39:55,842 --> 00:39:57,875
[sighs]
There you go.

759
00:39:57,877 --> 00:40:00,143
- [chuckles]
- Come on.

760
00:40:00,145 --> 00:40:01,881
Burgers and fries.

761
00:40:10,089 --> 00:40:12,223
So did you at least
get a slow dance in?

762
00:40:12,225 --> 00:40:15,328
- Nobody does that anymore.
- What? That's stupid.

763
00:40:17,462 --> 00:40:18,895
You look
really pretty.

764
00:40:18,897 --> 00:40:21,367
[cackles]
Yeah, I doubt that.

765
00:40:24,337 --> 00:40:26,170
I'm so stupid.
I just...

766
00:40:26,172 --> 00:40:28,375
I wanted to be like
everyone else for once.

767
00:40:29,542 --> 00:40:32,045
I don't know.
Fitting in is overrated.

768
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,949
Why are you
so sweet to me?

769
00:40:38,618 --> 00:40:40,585
You're a dove.

770
00:40:40,587 --> 00:40:42,052
- You can't be mean to a dove.
- [chuckles]

771
00:40:42,054 --> 00:40:44,188
It's impossible.
Can't do it.

772
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,793
- [vomits]
- Oh.

773
00:40:49,996 --> 00:40:51,831
[door closes]
Hey oh!

774
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:54,532
Oh!

775
00:40:54,534 --> 00:40:58,636
I didn't know that you were coming.
I'm such mess right now.

776
00:40:58,638 --> 00:41:00,808
It's okay. I'm just
here to pick up Jo.

777
00:41:02,407 --> 00:41:07,210
[sighs]
Jo! Laurie's here!

778
00:41:07,212 --> 00:41:12,884
- So, what you got goin' on here?
- I finished my Paris skyline.

779
00:41:12,886 --> 00:41:15,186
- Nobody cares.
- Laurie does.

780
00:41:15,188 --> 00:41:16,219
It's very nice.

781
00:41:16,221 --> 00:41:17,824
[giggles]

782
00:41:19,092 --> 00:41:20,391
Come on. I don't want
to miss the previews.

783
00:41:20,393 --> 00:41:22,226
Sorry, I'm in the zone.
Hold on one second.

784
00:41:22,228 --> 00:41:24,398
- [clears throat]
- I'm onto something really good. Hold on!

785
00:41:25,364 --> 00:41:26,429
Hold on!

786
00:41:26,431 --> 00:41:27,967
Okay!

787
00:41:29,368 --> 00:41:32,003
- Can I come?
- No.

788
00:41:32,005 --> 00:41:35,940
- Why not?
- Because we don't want you to come.

789
00:41:35,942 --> 00:41:38,009
- [Laurie] That's not true.
- No.

790
00:41:38,011 --> 00:41:39,210
She's not coming.

791
00:41:39,212 --> 00:41:42,212
I'm not a kid. You don't get
to tell me what to do anymore!

792
00:41:42,214 --> 00:41:46,516
Actually, you are. By definition, in fact.
Look it up.

793
00:41:46,518 --> 00:41:48,119
Okay, Jo, easy.
Come on.

794
00:41:48,121 --> 00:41:51,355
You don't have to deal with her
all day like I do.

795
00:41:51,357 --> 00:41:54,291
I just want to see a
movie with my sister.

796
00:41:54,293 --> 00:41:57,263
You just want to
see a movie with Laurie.

797
00:41:58,998 --> 00:42:00,965
She's so obsessed
with you.

798
00:42:00,967 --> 00:42:02,599
It's sickening.

799
00:42:02,601 --> 00:42:04,937
- [door slams]
- I hate you!

800
00:42:07,507 --> 00:42:10,043
[sighs]

801
00:42:12,545 --> 00:42:16,413
[Laurie] Hey, it's not too late.
You wanna go to Scoops maybe?

802
00:42:16,415 --> 00:42:19,150
[Jo] Laurie, no. I don't have time
to go get ice cream right now.

803
00:42:19,152 --> 00:42:21,518
- I am so inspired by that movie!
- [Laurie laughs]

804
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,688
Inspired? I thought you
said you hated it.

805
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:27,458
I did. But it just inspired
me to write something better.

806
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:30,527
'Cause if that crap is
getting made into movies,

807
00:42:30,529 --> 00:42:32,429
my scripts are
going to crush it.

808
00:42:32,431 --> 00:42:34,565
Oh, I thought you were
a novelist, not a screenwriter.

809
00:42:34,567 --> 00:42:37,201
I am. I just... I'm gonna do both.
How hard can it be?

810
00:42:37,203 --> 00:42:39,302
Have you seen my notebook?

811
00:42:39,304 --> 00:42:41,572
You know, I don't know why you
don't just use my old laptop.

812
00:42:41,574 --> 00:42:45,041
What would happen if it randomly
deleted all of my work?

813
00:42:45,043 --> 00:42:47,978
But a hard copy,
you never lose.

814
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:52,315
- Well, except for right now.
- It is not lost. It is misplaced.

815
00:42:52,317 --> 00:42:55,288
Okay, uh, guess I'll...
see you later then?

816
00:42:55,989 --> 00:42:57,958
Okay, bye.

817
00:42:58,725 --> 00:43:00,960
[door closes]

818
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,233
Still moping?

819
00:43:09,235 --> 00:43:11,501
Still looking for something?

820
00:43:11,503 --> 00:43:12,603
Give me that!

821
00:43:12,605 --> 00:43:15,572
Amy! Amy! Amy!
Give me that.

822
00:43:15,574 --> 00:43:18,208
Amy, give me that.
Amy! Amy!

823
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:21,212
- Open the door, you little brat!
- You should have let me come!

824
00:43:21,214 --> 00:43:24,014
- No one wanted you there!
- Laurie said he did!

825
00:43:24,016 --> 00:43:27,550
He also said he liked your paintings,
but he lied so you don't cry about it.

826
00:43:27,552 --> 00:43:32,088
[grunts] Why do you have
to be so difficult?

827
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:34,425
- He's my friend too!
- No, he's not.

828
00:43:34,427 --> 00:43:38,231
He thinks you're stupid and immature,
just like the rest of us do.

829
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:42,299
No!

830
00:43:42,301 --> 00:43:44,237
[screams]

831
00:43:50,676 --> 00:43:53,309
- I'm going to kill you!
- [screams]

832
00:43:53,311 --> 00:43:55,579
- What's going on?
- She burned it!

833
00:43:55,581 --> 00:43:57,148
Burned what?
Put that down!

834
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:59,386
My notebook!
What is wrong with you?

835
00:44:01,753 --> 00:44:04,123
You! Go to your room.

836
00:44:04,656 --> 00:44:05,558
Honey.

837
00:44:09,795 --> 00:44:12,131
Honey.

838
00:44:12,665 --> 00:44:17,268
I'm sorry. Hey...

839
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:20,206
I will never write
like that again!

840
00:44:25,411 --> 00:44:28,545
I know you're angry
right now and I get it.

841
00:44:28,547 --> 00:44:30,581
It's going to
take some time to heal.

842
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:32,516
But I promise you,

843
00:44:32,518 --> 00:44:37,224
the longer it takes for you to forgive
her, the longer your pain will last.

844
00:44:39,725 --> 00:44:44,163
All right, Rene, you ready for
a wild ride into the sunset?

845
00:44:45,464 --> 00:44:47,130
Come on.

846
00:44:47,132 --> 00:44:49,233
Crap. Buckle
on the cinch is busted.

847
00:44:49,235 --> 00:44:50,867
We'll have to double up.

848
00:44:50,869 --> 00:44:53,237
Serious?

849
00:44:53,239 --> 00:44:55,572
What? Do you think
I want to ride with you?

850
00:44:55,574 --> 00:44:57,608
- It's either this or we can't go.
- Fine.

851
00:44:57,610 --> 00:44:59,576
We only have an hour of daylight.
[clicks tongue]

852
00:44:59,578 --> 00:45:01,080
- Come on.
- Come on.

853
00:45:05,518 --> 00:45:08,719
[Amy] Jo! Laurie!

854
00:45:08,721 --> 00:45:10,688
Guys!
I wanna come with!

855
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:13,190
- [horse whinnies]
- Jo! Jo! Wait up!

856
00:45:13,192 --> 00:45:15,391
Hold up, guys!
Guys, wait!

857
00:45:15,393 --> 00:45:16,527
Jo!

858
00:45:16,529 --> 00:45:17,531
Whoa, whoa.

859
00:45:19,197 --> 00:45:21,201
- What should we do?
- What do you think?

Hey, look.

873
00:46:11,717 --> 00:46:13,317
Is that Saint?

874
00:46:13,319 --> 00:46:14,621
[Jo]
Sure looks like it.

875
00:46:15,855 --> 00:46:18,922
Hey. Hey.

876
00:46:18,924 --> 00:46:20,757
- [Laurie] Saint.
- Saint!

877
00:46:20,759 --> 00:46:22,726
Easy, boy. Hey.

878
00:46:22,728 --> 00:46:23,726
[Jo] Saint.

879
00:46:23,728 --> 00:46:27,831
Yeah, come here.
No, no. Saint.

880
00:46:27,833 --> 00:46:29,967
- [Laurie] Jo, you don't think...
- No.

881
00:46:29,969 --> 00:46:32,405
- [Laurie] There's no way.
- She's back at the barn.

882
00:46:35,407 --> 00:46:37,409
- Amy!
- [Laurie] Hey, Amy!

883
00:46:37,909 --> 00:46:39,311
Amy!

884
00:46:40,246 --> 00:46:42,612
Amy, yell if you can hear me.

885
00:46:42,614 --> 00:46:44,717
- [whinnies]
- Saddle.

886
00:46:47,652 --> 00:46:48,754
Amy?

887
00:46:49,889 --> 00:46:51,491
- Amy?
- Amy!

888
00:46:51,824 --> 00:46:53,426
Amy!

889
00:46:54,793 --> 00:46:57,364
Amy. No. No, no, no.

890
00:46:57,830 --> 00:46:59,362
Help me.
Please.

891
00:46:59,364 --> 00:47:01,965
[Laurie]
Easy, easy. Amy.

892
00:47:01,967 --> 00:47:04,235
- Amy!
- Easy. Easy, easy.

893
00:47:04,237 --> 00:47:06,436
Oh, my God.

894
00:47:06,438 --> 00:47:07,804
Amy.

895
00:47:07,806 --> 00:47:08,973
Amy!

896
00:47:08,975 --> 00:47:11,541
Jo, it's okay.
Hold this. Hold this on her.

897
00:47:11,543 --> 00:47:13,576
Hold it right there. I'm
gonna go get some help.

898
00:47:13,578 --> 00:47:16,515
- No. Amy. [sobbing]
- It's okay.

899
00:47:20,018 --> 00:47:23,587
- Amy.
- Come on.

900
00:47:23,589 --> 00:47:24,590
Amy.

901
00:47:25,525 --> 00:47:29,196
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

902
00:47:33,766 --> 00:47:37,604
Please.
Help.

903
00:47:40,306 --> 00:47:43,340
[crying]
Amy.

904
00:47:43,342 --> 00:47:45,009
[Amy] I just wanted
to come with you.

905
00:47:45,011 --> 00:47:47,911
I know.
I should have let you.

906
00:47:47,913 --> 00:47:49,947
I'm sorry
I destroyed your journal.

907
00:47:49,949 --> 00:47:52,549
I don't care
about the journal.

908
00:47:52,551 --> 00:47:54,617
Okay, I so cared
about the journal.

909
00:47:54,619 --> 00:47:56,690
It was my entire life's work.
How can I not?

910
00:47:58,023 --> 00:48:03,893
But, I'd rather lose every word
I ever wrote than lose you.

911
00:48:03,895 --> 00:48:05,628
[chuckles]
That's a lot of words.

912
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:07,701
I'll write a heck
of a lot more.

913
00:48:11,002 --> 00:48:13,505
Maybe this will help.

914
00:48:13,938 --> 00:48:15,375
Amy.
[scoffs]

915
00:48:16,942 --> 00:48:19,909
I know that sometimes you might
not like me much, but...

916
00:48:19,911 --> 00:48:21,679
No.

917
00:48:21,681 --> 00:48:23,547
Do not say that.

918
00:48:23,549 --> 00:48:26,349
We are just...
different.

919
00:48:26,351 --> 00:48:27,684
<i>And know what 'tis to pity.</i>

920
00:48:27,686 --> 00:48:31,755
Let gentleness
my strong enforcement be,

921
00:48:31,757 --> 00:48:36,626
in the which hope
I blush and hide my sword.

922
00:48:36,628 --> 00:48:39,663
True it is that
we have seen better days

923
00:48:39,665 --> 00:48:43,670
and have with holy bell
been knolled to church.

924
00:48:45,571 --> 00:48:48,005
I like watching
the rehearsals.

925
00:48:48,007 --> 00:48:49,806
Well, the Duke
needs to step it up.

926
00:48:49,808 --> 00:48:50,708
He's still
not off book.

927
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:53,780
Just let the creative
process inspire you.

928
00:48:55,114 --> 00:48:57,947
Or just try to enjoy it.

929
00:48:57,949 --> 00:49:02,386
I will have you know I love plays,
I just hate this monologue.

930
00:49:02,388 --> 00:49:04,657
What? How? Why?
It's beautiful.

931
00:49:05,857 --> 00:49:08,494
Beautiful?
It's depressing.

932
00:49:09,462 --> 00:49:11,728
All the world's a stage

933
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:14,398
and all the men and women
merely players.

934
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,366
[Jo with actor] They have
their exits and entrances,

935
00:49:16,368 --> 00:49:19,902
and one man in his time
plays many parts.

936
00:49:19,904 --> 00:49:23,440
It is one of Bill's
most depressing soliloquies.

937
00:49:23,442 --> 00:49:29,112
I like to think a life is a bit more
meaningful than playing a part on a stage.

938
00:49:29,114 --> 00:49:34,016
Shining morning face creeping like
a snail unwillingly to school.

939
00:49:34,018 --> 00:49:36,322
- I don't see it that way at all.
- No?

940
00:49:38,456 --> 00:49:40,659
Please enlighten me,
Professor Bhaer.

941
00:49:42,594 --> 00:49:45,596
I think it's about growth
and accepting change.

942
00:49:45,598 --> 00:49:47,197
We come into this world perfect.

943
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:52,469
Then we go through all these stages of
learning, shifting, changing, breaking even.

944
00:49:52,471 --> 00:49:54,570
And we become
something new,

945
00:49:54,572 --> 00:49:59,545
something... far from perfect
but perfectly unique.

946
00:50:01,781 --> 00:50:03,514
I find that inspiring.

947
00:50:03,516 --> 00:50:06,750
I guess that is one way
to think about it.

948
00:50:06,752 --> 00:50:12,489
"Last scene of all, that
ends this strange history,

949
00:50:12,491 --> 00:50:14,958

and mere oblivion,

00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:20,532
sans teeth, sans taste,
sans every... thing."

[Laurie] <i>I'm scared.</i>

952
00:50:23,536 --> 00:50:26,103
You have a hundred letters in your hand.
Open 'em. One will be a yes.

953
00:50:26,105 --> 00:50:29,038
I still can't believe
you only applied to one school.

954
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,741
When you're meant for the best,
you don't settle for less.

955
00:50:31,743 --> 00:50:34,076
I'd settle for UMass
Lowell at this point.

956
00:50:34,078 --> 00:50:36,045
Just open them.

957
00:50:36,047 --> 00:50:37,780
[sighs] I can't. You do it.

958
00:50:37,782 --> 00:50:40,420
- Okay.
- Uh, start with this one.

959
00:50:42,188 --> 00:50:43,923
[grunts]
Okay.

960
00:50:47,525 --> 00:50:49,992
Right.
"Mr. Laurie Laurence,

961
00:50:49,994 --> 00:50:52,195
thank you for your application
to Stanford University.

962

We are pleased to announce your
acceptance for the fall semester."

963
00:50:56,067 --> 00:50:58,469
- I got in?
- Yes! I knew you would.

964
00:50:58,471 --> 00:51:00,540
I can't believe it!

965
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:03,607
- Yes.
- [laughs]

966
00:51:03,609 --> 00:51:04,942
Let's open the rest.

967
00:51:04,944 --> 00:51:08,078
Oh! Throw 'em away! Burn 'em! I don't care.
I'm going to Stanford!

968
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:08,982
[screams]

969
00:51:10,549 --> 00:51:12,014
Okay, okay.
Your turn.

970
00:51:12,016 --> 00:51:14,217
[sighs]
You do the honors.

971
00:51:14,219 --> 00:51:15,922
[in posh accent]
With pleasure.

972
00:51:20,558 --> 00:51:25,962
"Miss Josephine March, We thank you for
your interest in the University of Oxford.

973
00:51:25,964 --> 00:51:27,699
It is with regret that..."

974
00:51:35,574 --> 00:51:37,976
Jo, I'm sorry.

975
00:51:55,194 --> 00:51:56,496

You've got to get goin'. You're
going to miss orientation.

978
00:52:17,882 --> 00:52:20,052
Stanford waits for no man.
[clears throat]

979
00:52:20,886 --> 00:52:22,819
It's not fair.

980
00:52:22,821 --> 00:52:25,221
- You're so much smarter than me.
- It's fine.

981

I'm gonna hang out here, write a
few novels and hang out with Beth.

You're gonna be back
before we know it.

- I'll text you when I get there.
- Yeah.

00:54:13,398 --> 00:54:16,233
What if Marek
was actually a girl,

1006
00:54:16,235 --> 00:54:19,168
who dresses up as a boy
to make her journey safer,

1007
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:22,338
but then by the third act
she can no longer hide?

1008
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:23,676
Beth.

1009
00:54:25,043 --> 00:54:26,812
That is genius!

1010
00:54:29,415 --> 00:54:32,282
I think that Clarissa should still
fall in love with the Prince.

1011
00:54:32,284 --> 00:54:34,284
It's not a love story!

1012
00:54:34,286 --> 00:54:35,755
Isn't everything?

1013
00:54:37,723 --> 00:54:39,993
Overall, though,
I loved it.

1014
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:44,728
I don't think I'll ever be as good
at anything as you are at writing.

1015
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:47,766
You're way better
at being a good human.

1016
00:54:48,701 --> 00:54:50,203
I can help you
with that.

1017
00:54:51,436 --> 00:54:53,335
Oh, and piano.

1018
00:54:53,337 --> 00:54:55,739
Mmm.
Can't help you there.

1019
00:54:55,741 --> 00:54:56,773
You're pretty much
hopeless.

1020
00:54:56,775 --> 00:54:58,911
- [scoffs]
- [giggles]

1021
00:54:59,478 --> 00:55:00,780
I just...

1022
00:55:02,313 --> 00:55:06,685
I want to write something that
won't be forgotten after I die.

1023
00:55:08,087 --> 00:55:09,722
You will.

1024
00:55:10,288 --> 00:55:11,723
I know it.

1025
00:55:17,429 --> 00:55:20,163
- It's the one.
- What do you mean?

1026
00:55:20,165 --> 00:55:22,701
You know. The draft to
send out to publishers?

1027
00:55:24,502 --> 00:55:26,503
[grunts]

1028
00:55:26,505 --> 00:55:29,809
Jo. I-I don't...

1029
00:55:31,375 --> 00:55:33,409
- It's not quite ready.
- How do you know?

1030
00:55:33,411 --> 00:55:36,279
You haven't finished it yet.
[scoffs]

1031
00:55:36,281 --> 00:55:37,447
I just know.

1032
00:55:37,449 --> 00:55:40,817
It's a grueling process.
Listen.

1033
00:55:40,819 --> 00:55:44,920
Madeleine L'Engle
racked up 26 rejections

1034
00:55:44,922 --> 00:55:46,155
before <i>Wrinkle</i>
was published.

1035
00:55:46,157 --> 00:55:48,058
Is that supposed to
make me feel better?

1036
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:49,326
It's supposed to
give you perspective.

1037
00:55:49,328 --> 00:55:53,797
Even Freddy Bhaer wrote
an impressive 14 novels

1038
00:55:53,799 --> 00:55:54,931
before he was published.

1039
00:55:54,933 --> 00:55:57,266
Oh, "Freddy Bhaer."
Wow.

1040
00:55:57,268 --> 00:55:59,304
You love throwing your name
in there, right?

1041
00:56:00,772 --> 00:56:03,206
[sighs]
Is it any good?

1042
00:56:03,208 --> 00:56:05,509
Some say yes.

1043
00:56:05,511 --> 00:56:08,313
The <i>New Yorker</i> said "lacks
linguistic vision," so...

1044
00:56:09,514 --> 00:56:11,114
You should
read it sometime.

1045
00:56:11,116 --> 00:56:12,185
I will.

1046
00:56:13,418 --> 00:56:16,018
Right after
you send off my draft.

1047
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:20,292
Maybe... Maybe it's time to
take a break from this one.

1048
00:56:21,826 --> 00:56:23,058
Work on something new.

1049
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:24,994
Something new?

1050
00:56:24,996 --> 00:56:26,962
I've been working on this
for ten years.

1051
00:56:26,964 --> 00:56:28,799
That's exactly
why it might be helpful

1052
00:56:28,801 --> 00:56:30,866
to try working on something
else for a change.

1053
00:56:30,868 --> 00:56:32,201
So you're not going to help me?

1054
00:56:32,203 --> 00:56:33,869
What do you think
I've been doing?

1055
00:56:33,871 --> 00:56:36,172
I don't know, actually.

1056
00:56:36,174 --> 00:56:39,208
Why do you spend so much time with
me if you don't think I can do it?

1057
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:41,545
I didn't say that, and I thought
we liked spending time together.

1058
00:56:41,547 --> 00:56:43,282
That's beside the point!

1059
00:56:44,282 --> 00:56:45,982
Is it?

1060
00:56:45,984 --> 00:56:48,154
- [phone vibrates]
- Josephine.

1061
00:56:49,888 --> 00:56:52,087
- I have to go.
- We need to talk about this.

1062
00:56:52,089 --> 00:56:54,226
I don't want to talk about it.

1063
00:56:56,828 --> 00:56:58,161
[door slams]

1064
00:56:58,163 --> 00:56:59,232
[sighs]

1065
00:57:01,266 --> 00:57:04,433
Marmee, I just want to say
before you say anything...

1066
00:57:04,435 --> 00:57:05,904
<i>Listen to me.
It's back.</i>

1067
00:57:06,971 --> 00:57:08,137
[Jo]
You have to eat it!

1068
00:57:08,139 --> 00:57:09,471
[Amy] I don't wanna eat it.
It's so gross!

1069
00:57:09,473 --> 00:57:11,474
[Jo]
You asked for a dare!

1070
00:57:11,476 --> 00:57:12,976
Don't eat it
if you don't want to.

1071
00:57:12,978 --> 00:57:14,076
What the heck,
you guys?

1072
00:57:14,078 --> 00:57:16,246
- Come back.
- Oh, my God!

1073
00:57:16,248 --> 00:57:17,114
Let it go.

1074
00:57:17,116 --> 00:57:20,150
Whatever! I heard
you the first time!

1075
00:57:20,152 --> 00:57:22,085
Okay, okay.
We're going on.

1076
00:57:22,087 --> 00:57:25,387
It's my turn.
It's my turn. Okay.

1077
00:57:25,389 --> 00:57:27,456
Laurie, truth or dare.

1078
00:57:27,458 --> 00:57:28,958
- Truth.
- Coward.

1079
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,862
Who do you think
is the prettiest girl here?

1080
00:57:31,864 --> 00:57:33,864
Oh, you are lame.

1081
00:57:33,866 --> 00:57:36,099
Easy. Meg.
No question.

1082
00:57:36,101 --> 00:57:40,637
Now, Brooke, um, what's your
thoughts on the matter? Hmm?

1083
00:57:40,639 --> 00:57:43,172
You know, I only see inner beauty.
So...

1084
00:57:43,174 --> 00:57:45,942
Oh! Okay. All right.
That's enough.

1085
00:57:45,944 --> 00:57:47,543
- [retches]
- Look, she's pretty.

1086
00:57:47,545 --> 00:57:49,246
Inside and out.
We all get it.

1087
00:57:49,248 --> 00:57:51,882
- This is stupid. Let's play Extreme Sardine.
- Yeah!

1088
00:57:51,884 --> 00:57:57,186
I say the last person to find me has
to lick every one of our big toes.

1089
00:57:57,188 --> 00:57:58,255
Oh!

1090
00:57:58,257 --> 00:58:00,357
One, two,

1091
00:58:00,359 --> 00:58:03,960
[all]
three, four, five,

1092
00:58:03,962 --> 00:58:08,398
six, seven, eight, nine,

1093
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,969
[both] ten.

1094
00:58:11,235 --> 00:58:12,237
Oh.

1095
00:58:17,375 --> 00:58:18,910
I see you!

1096
00:58:32,523 --> 00:58:33,993
Jo?

1097
00:58:47,038 --> 00:58:48,907
[taps piano keys]

1098
00:58:58,382 --> 00:59:01,052
[begins playing piano]

1099
00:59:23,407 --> 00:59:26,076
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm so sorry. The...

1100
00:59:26,078 --> 00:59:29,378
You come in here,
you play my favorite piece,

1101
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:32,051
and you don't have
the decency to finish it?

1102
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:34,183
Hmm?

1103
00:59:34,185 --> 00:59:35,719
Go.

1104
00:59:35,721 --> 00:59:37,420
I-I'm sorry.

1105
00:59:37,422 --> 00:59:39,755
As well you should be.

1106
00:59:39,757 --> 00:59:43,726
And I think that you should come
over here three days a week

1107
00:59:43,728 --> 00:59:45,964
and play whatever you like.

1108
00:59:47,699 --> 00:59:49,502
Do we have a deal?

1109
00:59:50,402 --> 00:59:52,168
Well, then I...

1110
00:59:52,170 --> 00:59:55,975
I think this calls for a
little Beethoven, don't you?

1111
01:00:12,056 --> 01:00:13,993
[continues playing]

1112
01:01:17,322 --> 01:01:19,558
[doctor]
Chronic myelogenous leukemia.

1113
01:01:20,759 --> 01:01:23,159
Leukemia?

1114
01:01:23,161 --> 01:01:25,063
She's young, so there's
a lot we can do.

1115
01:01:27,299 --> 01:01:29,435
- [whispers] Cancer?
- It's a type of cancer.

1116
01:01:30,402 --> 01:01:33,503
[Marmee] So, okay.
What can we do?

1117
01:01:33,505 --> 01:01:37,474
We want to start with radiation
and chemotherapy immediately.

1118
01:01:37,476 --> 01:01:41,543
It will be very hard on her.
She's already quite frail.

1119
01:01:41,545 --> 01:01:45,215
- But she seems like a fighter.
- Do not call her frail!

1120
01:01:45,217 --> 01:01:46,683
You don't even know her!

1121
01:01:46,685 --> 01:01:48,550
Josephine.
Josephine.

1122
01:01:48,552 --> 01:01:51,257
Meg, honey, will you
go get her please? Go.

1123
01:01:52,857 --> 01:01:55,427
- I'm really sorry.
- It's a lot.

1124
01:01:56,761 --> 01:01:58,197
Uhh!

1125
01:02:01,366 --> 01:02:02,435
[yells]

1126
01:02:09,141 --> 01:02:10,476
I'm sorry.

1127
01:02:14,645 --> 01:02:17,582
[monitor beeping]

1128
01:02:33,931 --> 01:02:35,498
[sighs]

1129
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:37,136
It's gonna be okay.

1130
01:02:38,770 --> 01:02:41,503
What if I get sick too?

1131
01:02:41,505 --> 01:02:45,507
What if I die before
I get to do anything?

1132
01:02:45,509 --> 01:02:50,679
I've never been in love.
I've never had a boyfriend.

1133
01:02:50,681 --> 01:02:52,250
Never even been kissed.

1134
01:02:54,252 --> 01:02:58,257
Hey. You're gonna be okay.

1135
01:03:00,424 --> 01:03:04,194
I promise. You're not gonna
die without being kissed.

1136
01:03:04,196 --> 01:03:05,929
How do you know?

1137
01:03:05,931 --> 01:03:07,465
I just know.

1138
01:03:08,433 --> 01:03:10,400
Even if I have to
do it myself,

1139
01:03:10,402 --> 01:03:11,800
I'm gonna make it happen.

1140
01:03:11,802 --> 01:03:13,936
[chuckling]

1141
01:03:13,938 --> 01:03:15,406
Fine.

1142
01:03:21,813 --> 01:03:24,913
Excuse me, sir, you can't go
past here without signing in.

1143
01:03:24,915 --> 01:03:27,683
I'm not a <i>sir,</i> sir.

1144
01:03:27,685 --> 01:03:31,520
Check your clipboard. Name's Jo March.
I'm already signed in.

1145
01:03:31,522 --> 01:03:34,626
[sighs] You're tired, honey.
I'm sorry.

1146
01:03:36,328 --> 01:03:38,697
- You're looking better though.
- Thanks.

1147
01:03:40,364 --> 01:03:42,599
- Where have you been?
- I was so worried about you.

1148
01:03:42,601 --> 01:03:45,969
Beth, do not worry about me. I'm fine.
I-I'm sorry. I freaked out.

1149
01:03:45,971 --> 01:03:50,572
I know. I-I felt so helpless,
and so I had to do something.

1150
01:03:50,574 --> 01:03:53,275
So I started on the Internet,
didn't know what to do.

1151
01:03:53,277 --> 01:03:56,913
Horrible idea. WebMD
scared the crap out of me.

1152
01:03:56,915 --> 01:04:00,916
And then I started Googling
all these cures and treatments

1153
01:04:00,918 --> 01:04:04,723
and three hours in, I realized
that's not what you need.

1154
01:04:06,023 --> 01:04:11,628
Beth, I know
you're gonna fight this.

1155
01:04:11,630 --> 01:04:13,532
And I know
you're gonna beat it.

1156
01:04:14,266 --> 01:04:15,998
You have to.

1157
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,237
So, one thing
that I promise...

1158
01:04:20,471 --> 01:04:24,607
that I'm going to be by your
side for every bit of it.

1159
01:04:24,609 --> 01:04:28,444
So if you have to go on a special
diet of spinach juice and tree bark,

1160
01:04:28,446 --> 01:04:30,380
- I will eat it with you.
- [giggling]

1161
01:04:30,382 --> 01:04:32,614
If you have to bathe
in essential oils twice a day,

1162
01:04:32,616 --> 01:04:36,386
I will join that pyramid scheme,
and I will get you those oils.

1163
01:04:36,388 --> 01:04:40,759
If you're gonna lose
that gorgeous hair...

1164
01:04:44,895 --> 01:04:46,631
well, soldier...

1165
01:04:51,969 --> 01:04:53,503
[gasps]

1166
01:04:53,505 --> 01:04:55,840
I'm losing it with you.

1167
01:04:56,907 --> 01:04:58,444
Wow!

1168
01:04:59,444 --> 01:05:02,011
That's really bald.

1169
01:05:02,013 --> 01:05:03,445
[trembling]

1170
01:05:03,447 --> 01:05:06,516
God, it feels like
the head of an alien.

1171
01:05:06,518 --> 01:05:08,650
[Marmee] What did you do with your hair?
Did you donate it?

1172
01:05:08,652 --> 01:05:11,688
No, Mom. I sold it to pay
for that stupid candy machine.

01:05:11,690 --> 01:05:13,389

selection down there.

- [screams]
- Gosh!

1175
01:05:15,493 --> 01:05:16,826
Jo!

1176
01:05:16,828 --> 01:05:18,895
How did you... Why?

1177
01:05:18,897 --> 01:05:21,299
Your one beauty.

1178
01:05:26,670 --> 01:05:30,609
Honey, cheer up. She's
gonna be all right.

1179
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:35,078
[Jo] I shouldn't be this upset.

1180
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:40,416
[Marmee] We all are, honey.
Come on, Jo.

1181
01:05:40,418 --> 01:05:41,753
It's natural.

1182
01:05:44,989 --> 01:05:47,857
It's okay to be upset. I know
she means the world to you.

1183
01:05:47,859 --> 01:05:51,694
No, it's... I never
realized how ugly I am.

1184
01:05:51,696 --> 01:05:54,130
Oh, honey,
your hair will grow back.

1185
01:05:54,132 --> 01:05:56,632
Not for forever.

1186
01:05:56,634 --> 01:05:59,000
Trust me, when you
look back at this time,

1187
01:05:59,002 --> 01:06:00,672
you're not gonna care
how you looked.

1188
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:06,679
Besides. What's the most important
is the workings of your mind.

1189
01:06:07,444 --> 01:06:10,348
Your humor, your kindness.

1190
01:06:10,982 --> 01:06:12,518
Your courage.

1191
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:19,457
Don't tell Bethy, okay?

1192
01:06:20,692 --> 01:06:22,525
Of course not.

1193
01:06:22,527 --> 01:06:24,897
She's lucky to have you.

1194
01:06:25,996 --> 01:06:28,466

- Yeah.

- It was a stupid oath that we made when we were kids.

01:09:05,923 --> 01:09:08,823
Why do you even want
to get married?

1231
01:09:08,825 --> 01:09:12,627
We don't live in the 1700s. We
don't have to rely on men anymore.

1232
01:09:12,629 --> 01:09:15,096
- Because I love him.
- Oh, how do you even know?

why I wanna be a mom and
get married and have kids,

1237
01:09:25,276 --> 01:09:26,609
but it's what I want.

1238

I don't believe you.

It's not your castle.
It's mine.

Meg, just remember this.

1241
01:09:33,317 --> 01:09:37,052
One day when you're 40 years
old, you're gonna wake up

1242
01:09:37,054 --> 01:09:40,055
and you're gonna look at
your wrinkly face in the mirror,

1243
01:09:40,057 --> 01:09:45,760
and you're gonna ask yourself,
"What did I do with my life,

1244
01:09:45,762 --> 01:09:49,799
except give up everything
for a man?"

1245
01:09:49,801 --> 01:09:55,203
How dare you belittle
my life and my dreams?

1246
01:09:55,205 --> 01:09:58,640
I have always been there for you with
your work and all of your ambitions,

1247

no matter how insane
they seemed to me.

All I'm asking is that you
be by my side for one day

to support me in the life I have
chosen to live, without judgment.

1252
01:10:15,994 --> 01:10:17,963
You seriously can't
give me that?

1253
01:10:20,731 --> 01:10:22,833
How selfish are you?

1254
01:10:39,917 --> 01:10:44,119
Dove's right.
We're growing up.

1255
01:10:44,121 --> 01:10:45,320
You have to deal with that.

1256
01:10:45,322 --> 01:10:49,257
So, I'm just supposed to sit
around, let her ruin her life?

1257
01:10:49,259 --> 01:10:53,931
Well, that's the point.
It's her life, it's not yours.

1258
01:10:57,401 --> 01:11:00,202
She's going to regret this.

1259
01:11:00,204 --> 01:11:02,941
If you don't go to this wedding,
you will regret it.

- So, what's next?
- I don't know.

1264
01:12:51,115 --> 01:12:54,949
Part of me wants to just chill
out and work on my music,

1265
01:12:54,951 --> 01:12:58,988
but there's so much pressure
to go out and get a real job.

1266
01:12:58,990 --> 01:13:01,290
Grandpa wants me to move
to London

1267

and learn the exciting world
of bond trading.

1268
01:13:04,962 --> 01:13:08,329
No, that is awesome.
You have to do it.

1269
01:13:08,331 --> 01:13:09,931
But what about my music?

1270
01:13:09,933 --> 01:13:12,568
Do both. It's London.

1271
01:13:12,570 --> 01:13:15,907
Come on.
You can't pass it up.

- Come with me.
- [scoffs] Okay.

You know I want to, but I can't.
Not yet anyway.

1274
01:13:24,915 --> 01:13:28,917
Why not? You've always said you
wanted to get out of here, so do it.

1275
01:13:28,919 --> 01:13:32,289
I have classes at Lowell.

1276

I-I cannot be
that far from Beth.

1277
01:13:41,164 --> 01:13:43,998
What if we both go
to New York instead?

1278
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,905
- You hate New York.
- So what?

1279
01:13:47,838 --> 01:13:49,305
It's closer to the family.

1280
01:13:49,307 --> 01:13:51,172
Then we could be together.

1281
01:13:51,174 --> 01:13:52,474
No.

1282
01:13:52,476 --> 01:13:55,243
No. You need to go
to Europe.

1283
01:13:55,245 --> 01:13:58,948
- Do not change your plans for me.
- But I want to be with you.

whenever I can.

because I know you love me too.

- I do, but...
- But what?

- You're like my brother.
- But I'm not.

1292
01:14:27,011 --> 01:14:30,112
- But I don't love you like that.
- Yes, you do.

in this whole world.

but it's... it's...

No, what we have is... It
is not that kind of love.

- It's...
- Because you won't...

1297

It's not you, Laurie. It's just I don't
know if that's what I want, Laurie.

- Yes, you do.
- With anyone ever!

- No, I don't!
- Yes, you will! One day you will!

You're gonna find someone...

for you to say no.

- No. No, not yet, honey.

- And it's twins. So...

- Why didn't you tell me?
- I wanted to surprise you.

1321

Oh, please! You wanted
to see my reaction.

1322

Oh.

1323
01:16:03,574 --> 01:16:05,207
It was entertaining.

01:16:55,092 --> 01:17:00,331
You're out making your mark
in <i>New York City.</i>

1338
01:17:01,365 --> 01:17:03,465
So proud of you.

1339
01:17:03,467 --> 01:17:06,301
Waking up every morning
in a city full of...

1340
01:17:06,303 --> 01:17:07,472
I hate it.

1341
01:17:09,106 --> 01:17:11,573
- I thought you loved it.
- No.

1342
01:17:11,575 --> 01:17:14,275
Well, it's New York.
Everybody says they love it.

1343
01:17:14,277 --> 01:17:17,115
You have to,
but nobody really does.

1344
01:17:19,049 --> 01:17:23,652
I thought I would feel inspired, but
instead of bringing out my creativity,

1345
01:17:23,654 --> 01:17:27,189
- it brings out my anger issues.
- Uh-oh.

1346
01:17:27,191 --> 01:17:31,225
Sometimes when I'm
walking up the subway steps,

1347
01:17:31,227 --> 01:17:34,128
and people are shoving
and on their phones,

1348
01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:36,665
I just want to grab them
by the shoulders and scream,

1349
01:17:36,667 --> 01:17:43,771
"Do you know there is a big,
spacious green world out there?"

1350
01:17:43,773 --> 01:17:45,343
You don't though, right?

1351
01:17:46,643 --> 01:17:53,051
One time, to a really nice
Chinese man named Han.

1352
01:17:54,451 --> 01:17:57,752
And, apparently, everybody's
dream is to be a writer.

1353
01:17:57,754 --> 01:18:01,857
Except Han. He's a fishmonger,
and he's doing great.

1354
01:18:01,859 --> 01:18:03,428
I just...

1355
01:18:05,161 --> 01:18:07,197
don't think I can compete.

1356
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:11,233
You're the best writer
I know.

1357
01:18:11,235 --> 01:18:15,703
Well, no offense,
but you don't get out much.

1358
01:18:15,705 --> 01:18:18,306
[both laugh]

1359
01:18:18,308 --> 01:18:21,710
[Jo] Still think there's some
pretty juicy secrets in here.

1360
01:18:21,712 --> 01:18:24,212
Don't even think
about it.

1361
01:18:24,214 --> 01:18:27,582
I'm pretty sure we've
outgrown the club rules.

1362
01:18:27,584 --> 01:18:31,487
- Maybe you old hags have.
- [gasps] Amy! You made it!

1363
01:18:31,489 --> 01:18:33,454
Ooh.

1364
01:18:33,456 --> 01:18:37,126
You seriously look like this
after an international flight?

1365
01:18:37,128 --> 01:18:39,130
It was the longest flight
of my life.

1366
01:18:40,530 --> 01:18:41,762
[laughs]

1367
01:18:41,764 --> 01:18:43,200
- [Beth] Amy.
- Beth!

1368
01:18:47,471 --> 01:18:50,538
- I missed you.
- I missed you more.

1369
01:18:50,540 --> 01:18:55,610
Mm! Whoa! We do not fit
on this like we used to.

1370
01:18:55,612 --> 01:18:58,479
Amy, I want to hear
all about Oxford.

1371
01:18:58,481 --> 01:19:01,350
One semester left, and already
two different galleries

1372
01:19:01,352 --> 01:19:03,351
wanna buy my Haslemere
landscape series.

1373
01:19:03,353 --> 01:19:04,786
What about the
"Watching Deer Triptych"?

1374
01:19:04,788 --> 01:19:06,921
- Oh, that's my favorite!
- The what?

1375
01:19:06,923 --> 01:19:09,224
So, last week, I met
with the Lisson Gallery,

1376
01:19:09,226 --> 01:19:13,228
- and they seem interested.
- That's so exciting!

1377
01:19:13,230 --> 01:19:17,466
Wait, what? The what gallery? Why do I
not know what you're talking about?

1378
01:19:17,468 --> 01:19:19,734
If you answered your phone,
you would know.

1379
01:19:19,736 --> 01:19:21,636
Wait. Who dug this out?

1380
01:19:21,638 --> 01:19:23,305
Oh...

1381
01:19:23,307 --> 01:19:26,377
I always want to read through
it when I'm here alone.

1382
01:19:29,746 --> 01:19:31,345
Oh, my gosh.

1383
01:19:31,347 --> 01:19:32,382
What?

1384
01:19:32,917 --> 01:19:34,384
Okay.

1385
01:19:35,486 --> 01:19:37,952
I think it's time
to share this one.

1386
01:19:37,954 --> 01:19:42,558
<i>♪ I'm not afraid
Of the storm ♪</i>

1387
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:45,394
So, I guess now I know why you
joined the home-schooled crew.

1388
01:19:45,396 --> 01:19:48,396
Yep. And now you know why I
used to clip little pug nose.

1389
01:19:48,398 --> 01:19:50,498
I miss your
little pug nose.

1390
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:53,737
- <i>♪ As they made ♪</i>
- [no audible dialogue]

1391
01:19:56,373 --> 01:19:58,774
- <i>♪ In your heart ♪</i>
- I had such a crush on him.

1392
01:19:58,776 --> 01:20:00,841
You had a crush
on everybody.

1393
01:20:00,843 --> 01:20:02,277
Hey!

1394
01:20:02,279 --> 01:20:04,579
[Meg] <i>Prom.
The year you didn't come.</i>

1395
01:20:04,581 --> 01:20:10,551
[Jo] <i>Chasing wine coolers with

1396
01:20:10,553 --> 01:20:11,619

1397
01:20:11,621 --> 01:20:14,422
[Jo] <i>It was the best

1398
01:20:14,424 --> 01:20:16,390
<i>It was the worst

01:20:16,392 --> 01:20:18,393
[Beth] <i>It seems like

1400
01:20:18,395 --> 01:20:21,331
- <i>When did we get so old?</i>
- [Amy] <i>Speak for yourself!</i>

1401
01:20:22,398 --> 01:20:24,632
<i>♪ All of our stories ♪</i>

1402
01:20:24,634 --> 01:20:27,402
Oh, he still hates
when you call him that.

1403
01:20:27,404 --> 01:20:30,439
Then I will continue
to do so.

1404
01:20:30,441 --> 01:20:32,774
I'm just glad
you speak to him at all.

1405
01:20:32,776 --> 01:20:36,345
I think it should be illegal for
anybody under 30 to get married.

1406
01:20:36,347 --> 01:20:39,848
Well, you're almost there,
so... any prospects?

1407
01:20:39,850 --> 01:20:42,783
No. Not you too?

1408
01:20:42,785 --> 01:20:47,256
I'm just curious. And
vicariously living through you.

1409
01:20:47,258 --> 01:20:49,591
Hey, Jo. Do you mind
helping me with dinner?

1410
01:20:49,593 --> 01:20:53,327
Oh, sorry. We're working
on our "Heart and Soul" duet.

1411
01:20:53,329 --> 01:20:55,497
Really gonna wow
everyone this year.

1412
01:20:55,499 --> 01:20:58,567
- Just come help me, please.
- Put me on trash duty.

1413
01:20:58,569 --> 01:21:00,405
Jo, please.

1414
01:21:02,673 --> 01:21:04,739
[Jo] I thought you
needed my help.

1415
01:21:04,741 --> 01:21:07,376
[Amy] I just said that because I
wanted to be alone for a minute.

1416
01:21:07,378 --> 01:21:09,543
Is everything okay?

1417
01:21:09,545 --> 01:21:11,579
Yeah. I just wanted to catch up.

1418
01:21:11,581 --> 01:21:13,748
There's so much
going on in both our lives

1419
01:21:13,750 --> 01:21:16,551
that I don't even know what we
don't know about each other.

1420
01:21:16,553 --> 01:21:18,723
- You know what I mean?
- Not really.

1421
01:21:20,023 --> 01:21:21,491
[forced laugh]

1422
01:21:23,893 --> 01:21:25,629
Okay, um...

1423
01:21:27,063 --> 01:21:30,931
I wanted to tell you
about me and...

1424
01:21:30,933 --> 01:21:32,967
[Meg] Laurie, you made it!

1425
01:21:32,969 --> 01:21:34,638
Laurie?

1426
01:21:36,039 --> 01:21:37,973
- It's so good to see you.
- You too.

1427
01:21:37,975 --> 01:21:39,440
Laurie.

1428
01:21:39,442 --> 01:21:40,775
Jo.

1429
01:21:40,777 --> 01:21:41,976
[screams]

1430
01:21:41,978 --> 01:21:44,613
[both laughing]

1431
01:21:44,615 --> 01:21:46,681
Laurie, I thought you
couldn't come till later.

1432
01:21:46,683 --> 01:21:50,051
I caught an earlier flight.
I wanted to surprise you guys.

1433
01:21:50,053 --> 01:21:51,853
Well, we are
definitely surprised.

1434
01:21:51,855 --> 01:21:55,857
I am so glad you're here.
Now it feels like Christmas.

1435
01:21:55,859 --> 01:21:57,359
- Hey, Laurie.
- Oh, my Bethy.

1436
01:21:57,361 --> 01:21:59,427
- Mmm.
- How are you?

1437
01:21:59,429 --> 01:22:03,064
You know me. Just happy
that everyone's home.

1438
01:22:03,066 --> 01:22:05,100
I missed my platoon.

1439
01:22:05,102 --> 01:22:09,837
Okay. What's new? I have not
talked to you in, like, forever!

1440
01:22:09,839 --> 01:22:13,841
You mean the last four e-mails that I
sent you that you didn't write back?

1441
01:22:13,843 --> 01:22:16,845
You know I'm better in person.

1442
01:22:16,847 --> 01:22:20,948
Come on. Tell me everything.
Spare me no details. None.

1443
01:22:20,950 --> 01:22:22,486
You first.

1444
01:22:27,825 --> 01:22:30,762
[no audible dialogue]

1445
01:22:53,584 --> 01:22:55,417
You know you're gonna
be a grandpa soon.

1446
01:22:55,419 --> 01:22:57,452
- If it's a girl...
- Grandpa? No.

1447
01:22:57,454 --> 01:22:59,787
[Marmee] We're gonna be
grandparents, guys!

1448
01:22:59,789 --> 01:23:03,625
- I'm not ready for that. I'm not ready for Grandpa.
- Twice as good.

1449
01:23:03,627 --> 01:23:06,127
I wanna hear about the business.
How's the...

1450
01:23:06,129 --> 01:23:07,528
You know, business is good.

1451
01:23:07,530 --> 01:23:09,064
[Jo]
He's lying!

1452
01:23:09,066 --> 01:23:12,400
He's a working man now. It's
respectable to be a working man.

1453
01:23:12,402 --> 01:23:15,103
I... I, uh, I can't complain.

1454
01:23:15,105 --> 01:23:16,904
[Meg] Are you
still doing your music?

1455
01:23:16,906 --> 01:23:18,473
You know, I can't complain.

1456
01:23:18,475 --> 01:23:21,409
- [everyone laughs]
- Gotcha. Gotcha.

1457
01:23:21,411 --> 01:23:22,778
You okay?

1458
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:25,646
Oops. Merry Christmas,
my pretties.

1459
01:23:25,648 --> 01:23:27,482
- [all yelling]
- Aunt March!

1460
01:23:27,484 --> 01:23:29,518
- Hey!
- [Jo] What are you doing here?

1461
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:30,818
What a surprise.

1462
01:23:30,820 --> 01:23:32,921
What happened to
your seniors cruise?

1463
01:23:32,923 --> 01:23:34,922
Well, I don't know.

1464
01:23:34,924 --> 01:23:38,693
I suppose the Danube has lost
its luster in my old age.

1465
01:23:38,695 --> 01:23:42,764
Aunt March, I think
that you're the only person

1466
01:23:42,766 --> 01:23:45,634
in the history of time that's
ever gotten bored with Europe.

1467
01:23:45,636 --> 01:23:48,702
- Besides Marco Polo.
- And Christopher Columbus.

1468
01:23:48,704 --> 01:23:51,006
- Countless immigrants also.
- Mm-hmm.

1469
01:23:51,008 --> 01:23:52,640
- The Vikings.
- The Beatles.

1470
01:23:52,642 --> 01:23:54,643
- One Direction.
- Tons of people, really.

1471
01:23:54,645 --> 01:23:57,112
Yeah, I get it.
Okay, got it. Ha ha!

1472
01:23:57,114 --> 01:23:58,680
Josephine,
this is for you.

1473
01:23:58,682 --> 01:23:59,848
You shouldn't have.
What?

1474
01:23:59,850 --> 01:24:02,516
I didn't. I found it
on your doorstep.

1475
01:24:02,518 --> 01:24:04,552
- Oh.
- Nearly tripped over it

1476
01:24:04,554 --> 01:24:06,220
when I went to pick up
your mail.

1477
01:24:06,222 --> 01:24:08,523
Can't say "Grandpa."
Somethin' else.

1478
01:24:08,525 --> 01:24:11,827
Pappy, pappy.
Poppy, Pop-pop.

1479
01:24:11,829 --> 01:24:12,864
Look at that.

1480
01:24:19,937 --> 01:24:21,101
[Marmee]
Who's it from?

1481
01:24:21,103 --> 01:24:23,204
Ooh. Who's Freddy?

1482
01:24:23,206 --> 01:24:25,172
Are you 12?

1483
01:24:25,174 --> 01:24:27,074
[Meg]
What does the note say?

1484
01:24:27,076 --> 01:24:29,944
It said,
"When life is rough..."

1485
01:24:29,946 --> 01:24:32,213
That's all I got to
before she slammed it shut.

1486
01:24:32,215 --> 01:24:34,515
[Papa March] All right, take it easy.
She's not gonna tell you.

1487
01:24:34,517 --> 01:24:35,917
You little cheat!

1488
01:24:35,919 --> 01:24:38,019
She'll tell me. Right?

1489
01:24:38,021 --> 01:24:39,554
- Yeah.
- Don't even try it.

1490
01:24:39,556 --> 01:24:40,921
- I'm not telling you.
- Come on.

1491
01:24:40,923 --> 01:24:42,556
- No.
- Jo, you always...

1492
01:24:42,558 --> 01:24:45,793
- I'm not telling anyone!
- You always tell your dad.

1493
01:24:45,795 --> 01:24:48,997
It's literally nothing.
There's nothing to tell!

1494
01:24:48,999 --> 01:24:51,936
- It's seriously nothing.
- Leave her alone.

1495
01:24:53,136 --> 01:24:56,070
It's probably from that
professor she's been seeing.

1496
01:24:56,072 --> 01:24:57,605
- Oh.
- [together] What?

1497
01:24:57,607 --> 01:24:59,573
- Professor?
- [Papa March] How old is this professor?

1498
01:24:59,575 --> 01:25:02,743
No, no, no, no.

1499
01:25:02,745 --> 01:25:06,915
We are not seeing each other.
He is a professor at Columbia

1500
01:25:06,917 --> 01:25:10,252
who is interested in my writing.
That's is all.

1501
01:25:10,254 --> 01:25:12,253
Jo, that's so exciting.

1502
01:25:12,255 --> 01:25:15,155
Is he also interested
in you?

1503
01:25:15,157 --> 01:25:17,725
No. It's strictly professional.

1504
01:25:17,727 --> 01:25:21,195
- Then why would he send you a package on Christmas Eve?
- That's a good point.

1505
01:25:21,197 --> 01:25:23,532
Because it's Christmas,

1506
01:25:23,534 --> 01:25:25,600
and you give people presents
on Christmas.

1507
01:25:25,602 --> 01:25:27,801
He sent me a Christmas present!

1508
01:25:27,803 --> 01:25:31,605
Why is that so hard to understand?
Is that okay with everybody?

1509
01:25:31,607 --> 01:25:33,274
That's very okay.
That is totally fine.

1510
01:25:33,276 --> 01:25:35,543
Come on.
No, I don't think so.

1511
01:25:35,545 --> 01:25:39,146
You're children.
All of you.

1512
01:25:39,148 --> 01:25:41,882
Especially Dad.
All of you!

1513
01:25:41,884 --> 01:25:44,786
No. That's great that he likes your
writing. He's a very smart man.

1514
01:25:44,788 --> 01:25:48,023
I wouldn't say that he likes it.

1515
01:25:48,025 --> 01:25:52,060
Every time I send him a draft, he sends
me pages and pages and pages of notes.

1516
01:25:52,062 --> 01:25:56,634
But I guess no matter how many drafts
I send, he still reads them, so...

1517
01:25:57,968 --> 01:25:59,935
Well, then he definitely
has a crush on you.

1518
01:25:59,937 --> 01:26:02,770
All right.
All right, I'm done. Out!

1519
01:26:02,772 --> 01:26:06,875
Hey, Jo.
You get back in that seat.

1520
01:26:06,877 --> 01:26:10,882
- Move, move!
- Sit down. We're just teasing you.

1521
01:26:12,648 --> 01:26:13,881
We're just interested
in your life.

1522
01:26:13,883 --> 01:26:16,650
Then stop trying
to freak me out.

1523
01:26:16,652 --> 01:26:17,851
[Papa March] All right, Joe.

1524
01:26:17,853 --> 01:26:19,988
Maybe you're just
overthinking this a bit.

1525
01:26:19,990 --> 01:26:22,256

"Ul" with a "U." It...

1527
01:26:25,094 --> 01:26:27,761
- You know what I meant.
- If you're gonna make a point, use the right word.

1528
01:26:27,763 --> 01:26:30,534
Laurie always read your stuff.
He was always just a friend.

1529
01:26:33,736 --> 01:26:38,340
Yeah. Maybe he's just a normal guy who just
so happens to be into mythopoeic fables.

1530
01:26:38,342 --> 01:26:40,274
- Yeah.
- [Laurie] You know?

1531
01:26:40,276 --> 01:26:43,043
Yes.

1532
01:26:43,045 --> 01:26:47,616
A toast. To Jo's novel,
and its inevitable success.

1533
01:26:47,618 --> 01:26:49,184
- Cheers.
- Cheers to Jo.

1534
01:26:49,186 --> 01:26:51,286
[all] Cheers.

1535
01:26:51,288 --> 01:26:56,157
And to Freddy. May his intentions be
pure and his heart not be broken.

1536
01:26:56,159 --> 01:26:58,926
I am not cheersing to that.

1537
01:26:58,928 --> 01:27:02,697
No! I am not... I am
not cheersing to that!

1538
01:27:02,699 --> 01:27:05,100
I am not cheersing!
Stop! I'm not!

1539
01:27:05,102 --> 01:27:06,704
[Jo] No!

Amy, are you okay?

1547
01:28:15,438 --> 01:28:17,439
Yeah.
I'm such a klutz.

1548
01:28:17,441 --> 01:28:20,111
- Oh, my... You're bleeding.
- I know.

1549
01:28:29,486 --> 01:28:33,657
[Amy] Jo! Come back!
Please just talk to me!

1550
01:28:34,725 --> 01:28:36,160
Let me explain.

1551
01:28:38,294 --> 01:28:42,796
He's been in London. So, of course
we've been seeing a lot of each other.

1552
01:28:42,798 --> 01:28:45,466
At first,
it was just as friends,

1553
01:28:45,468 --> 01:28:48,470
but then at some point,
it changed.

1554
01:28:48,472 --> 01:28:50,007
So, what?
You're dating now?

1555
01:28:51,074 --> 01:28:54,042
I know this must be
so weird for you.

1556
01:28:54,044 --> 01:28:56,147
At first it was weird
for me too...

1557
01:28:57,981 --> 01:28:59,850
but please
don't be mad at me.

1558
01:29:02,119 --> 01:29:03,254
Do you love him?

1559
01:29:04,187 --> 01:29:05,890
I think I always have.

1560
01:29:07,356 --> 01:29:08,892
And how does he feel?

1561
01:29:09,459 --> 01:29:11,792
The same.

1562
01:29:11,794 --> 01:29:14,065
At least that's what
he tells me.

1563
01:29:19,369 --> 01:29:22,237
Then, I'm happy for you.

1564
01:29:22,239 --> 01:29:23,438
You are?

1565
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:25,076
Of course.

1566
01:29:30,213 --> 01:29:33,148
That stinkin' Laurie.

1567
01:29:33,150 --> 01:29:37,818

I think they were nervous
about how you would react.

Why did she
have to choose him?

You didn't want him.

1582
01:30:43,587 --> 01:30:46,924
Yeah, but I didn't want anyone
else to have him either.

I'm not always gonna
be here to tell you.

I...

I don't think that I was ever
meant to be here for long.

1621
01:33:55,544 --> 01:33:58,548
And there's a reason why
I never wanted to move away.

two were gonna do all the things?

01:39:16,865 --> 01:39:17,801
[Beth] <i>You will.</i>

1671
01:39:18,834 --> 01:39:19,835
<i>I know it.</i>

1672
01:39:21,838 --> 01:39:25,506
<i>I don't think I'll ever be as good
at anything as you are at writing.</i>

1673
01:39:25,508 --> 01:39:29,313
[Jo] <i>You're way better
at being a good human.</i>

1674
01:39:36,518 --> 01:39:39,854
- [Beth] <i>I think this is my castle.</i>
- [Amy] <i>The attic?</i>

1675
01:39:39,856 --> 01:39:42,359
[Beth] <i>Just being
here with all of you.</i>

1676
01:39:45,794 --> 01:39:48,931
[older Beth] <i>We're growing up.
You have to deal with that.</i>

1677
01:39:56,172 --> 01:39:59,439
<i>To always help each other
reach our castles.</i>

1678
01:39:59,441 --> 01:40:01,544
<i>No matter where they may be.</i>

1679
01:40:58,734 --> 01:41:00,904
[Jo's voice] <i>There are
many Beths in the world.</i>

1680
01:41:02,204 --> 01:41:03,672
<i>Shy and quiet.</i>

1681
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:07,009
<i>Sitting in corners till needed.</i>

1682
01:41:08,210 --> 01:41:11,110
<i>And living for others
so cheerfully,</i>

1683
01:41:11,112 --> 01:41:13,581
<i>that no one sees the sacrifices</i>

1684
01:41:13,583 --> 01:41:16,018
<i>till the little cricket
on the hearth stops chirping.</i>

1685
01:41:17,786 --> 01:41:22,592
<i>And the sweet,
sunshiny presence vanishes...</i>

1686
01:41:24,826 --> 01:41:28,798
<i>leaving silence
and shadow behind.</i>

1687
01:41:59,128 --> 01:42:00,464
[sighs]

1688
01:42:03,132 --> 01:42:05,265
[giggling]

1689
01:42:05,267 --> 01:42:07,835
You happy? Yeah.

1690
01:42:07,837 --> 01:42:10,170
- [crying]
- Oh.

1691
01:42:10,172 --> 01:42:13,974
- I have no idea what to do with them yet.
- [chuckling]

1692
01:42:13,976 --> 01:42:17,610
But I think once they
become actual humans,

1693
01:42:17,612 --> 01:42:19,145
I'm gonna be
their favorite aunt.

1694
01:42:19,147 --> 01:42:22,082
- I'm sure you will be.
- [knocking]

1695
01:42:22,084 --> 01:42:24,952
Could you get it?
It might be their playdate.

1696
01:42:24,954 --> 01:42:28,087
Playdate? They...
They hardly move.

1697
01:42:28,089 --> 01:42:30,060
Just get the door.
Come here.

1698
01:42:31,060 --> 01:42:32,893
There we go.
Oh, hi.

1699
01:42:32,895 --> 01:42:36,296
Hi, there. Oh, my.

1700
01:42:36,298 --> 01:42:37,900
Who could be at the door?

1701
01:42:41,236 --> 01:42:42,538
Freddy.

1702
01:42:43,172 --> 01:42:45,072
What are you doing here?

1703
01:42:45,074 --> 01:42:46,843
I read your book.

1704
01:42:48,244 --> 01:42:50,743
A few times... actually.

1705
01:42:50,745 --> 01:42:55,783
Did you take a six-hour train
ride just to tell me that?

1706
01:42:55,785 --> 01:42:58,121
I needed to see something.

1707
01:43:05,794 --> 01:43:08,097
The famous March attic.

1708
01:43:09,965 --> 01:43:13,199
I can see why this was
a young tomboy's playground.

1709
01:43:13,201 --> 01:43:14,704
You really did read it.

1710
01:43:16,271 --> 01:43:17,673
Mm-hmm.

1711
01:43:34,990 --> 01:43:36,125
Jo, I'm sorry.

1712
01:43:43,965 --> 01:43:46,169
I'm sorry for
how we left things.

1713
01:43:50,972 --> 01:43:52,074
Me too.

1714
01:43:54,709 --> 01:43:58,244
I was not ready
to hear the truth.

1715
01:43:58,246 --> 01:44:00,950
But you were right.

1716
01:44:01,851 --> 01:44:03,954
You ready for
some more truth?

1717
01:44:05,954 --> 01:44:06,956
Let me guess.

1718
01:44:08,657 --> 01:44:12,161
It was childish,
cliché...

1719
01:44:14,163 --> 01:44:15,732
and my family is...

1720
01:44:17,032 --> 01:44:19,736
weird and boring.

1721
01:44:22,103 --> 01:44:23,804
The beginning was slow.

1722
01:44:23,806 --> 01:44:25,738
Your structure needs work,

1723
01:44:25,740 --> 01:44:29,042
and you have a tendency
for run-on sentences.

1724
01:44:29,044 --> 01:44:31,213
But it's beautiful
and authentic.

1725
01:44:33,048 --> 01:44:34,149
And I loved it.

1726
01:44:36,951 --> 01:44:38,154
You did?

1727
01:44:39,355 --> 01:44:40,889
I might have
even cried.

1728
01:44:42,057 --> 01:44:43,158
Twice.

1729
01:44:45,761 --> 01:44:46,996
I think this is the one.

1730
01:44:49,298 --> 01:44:51,765
Come back
to New York with me.

1731
01:44:51,767 --> 01:44:54,301
I can help you
get this book out.

1732
01:44:54,303 --> 01:44:57,171
Beth wouldn't want you to stay here
and let your talents go to waste.

1733
01:44:57,173 --> 01:44:58,108
Come back with me.

1734
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:07,480
That was supposed to be
my part.

1735
01:45:07,482 --> 01:45:09,119
Get used to it.

1736
01:45:27,837 --> 01:45:30,940
[no audible dialogue]

1737
01:45:44,954 --> 01:45:48,023
[no audible dialogue]

1738
01:45:55,097 --> 01:46:00,434
Hey, munchkins. What have you got?
Show me.

1739
01:46:00,436 --> 01:46:03,173
Oh, it's so pretty.
Is this for Aunt Jo?

1740
01:46:03,905 --> 01:46:05,975
Thank you so much.

1741
01:46:23,124 --> 01:46:26,059
I cannot believe
I'm breaking my own oath.

1742
01:46:26,061 --> 01:46:27,860
[all laugh]

1743
01:46:27,862 --> 01:46:29,298
You didn't break
the important ones.

1744
01:46:31,432 --> 01:46:34,835
I hate doing this
without her.

1745
01:46:34,837 --> 01:46:36,772
She's here.

1746
01:46:45,246 --> 01:46:46,883
I propose an oath.

1747
01:46:53,054 --> 01:46:55,758
An oath to surpass
all other oaths.

1748
01:47:06,168 --> 01:47:07,370
To always...

1749
01:47:09,204 --> 01:47:13,909
always...
try and be as good...

1750
01:47:15,977 --> 01:47:19,782
and sweet and strong...

1751
01:47:23,118 --> 01:47:24,254
as our Beth.

1752
01:47:25,454 --> 01:47:26,987
Always and forever.

1753
01:47:26,989 --> 01:47:28,924
Always and forever.

1754
01:47:51,246 --> 01:47:52,848
[all laughing]

1755
01:47:55,250 --> 01:47:56,285
