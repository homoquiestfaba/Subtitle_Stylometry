1
00:02:13,572 --> 00:02:16,572
There are other people involved!

2
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,470
Teenaged Journey, narrating:
<i>Mama named me Journey.</i>

3
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,471
<i>Journey...</i>

4
00:03:21,571 --> 00:03:25,470
<i>As if somehow she wished
her restlessness on me.</i>

5
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,470
<i>But it was mama who
would be gone when I was 11,</i>

6
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,470
<i>before spring
crashed onto our hillside</i>

7
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,469
<i>with explosions
from mount Laurel,</i>

8
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:35,469
<i>before summer came,</i>

9
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:37,469
<i>with the soft slap
of the screen door,</i>

10
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:39,469
<i>breathless nights and mildew</i>

11
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:41,569
<i>on the books.</i>

12
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:45,469
You shouldn't do this.
It's wrong.

13
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:48,469
I can't live here anymore.

14
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:51,469
You're always telling me
what I do wrong.

15
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:53,469
It's your house, too.
Your children.

16
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:55,469
They have you.

17
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,469
I'm not enough, Min.

18
00:03:58,569 --> 00:03:59,470
Oh, yes, you are.

19
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,469
You fill up this house, Marcus.

20
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:03,468
It's your house, your land,

21
00:04:03,568 --> 00:04:05,468
your grandchildren, your rules.

22
00:04:05,568 --> 00:04:07,468
And my fault,
like it's always been.

23
00:04:07,568 --> 00:04:09,468
Someone else's fault.

24
00:04:09,568 --> 00:04:11,468
I can't be
what you want, Marcus.

25
00:04:11,568 --> 00:04:13,468
I never could.

26
00:04:13,568 --> 00:04:14,469
Even when I was little,

27
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:17,468
you remember when I wanted
to ride the tractor with you?

28
00:04:17,568 --> 00:04:19,468
You said I shouldn't.

29
00:04:19,568 --> 00:04:21,468
When I wanted to work in town,

30
00:04:21,568 --> 00:04:23,468
you said I shouldn't.

31
00:04:23,568 --> 00:04:25,468
When I wanted
to go away to school,

32
00:04:25,568 --> 00:04:27,468
you made me stay here.

33
00:04:27,568 --> 00:04:29,468
Oh, that was a long time ago.

34
00:04:29,568 --> 00:04:32,567
Yeah. You gave up on me
a long time ago.

35
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:40,467
Is it my fault he left you, too?

36
00:04:40,567 --> 00:04:41,717
I don't think so.

37
00:04:46,318 --> 00:04:47,468
Nobody leaves this place.

38
00:04:47,568 --> 00:04:49,467
Family's lived here forever.

39
00:04:49,567 --> 00:04:52,567
Our family doesn't go away.

40
00:05:01,566 --> 00:05:04,466
I go away.

41
00:05:04,566 --> 00:05:07,466
It isn't fair
to Journey and Cat.

42
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:09,466
You come and go like a visitor.

43
00:05:09,566 --> 00:05:12,466
That's not a mother's way.

44
00:05:12,566 --> 00:05:14,566
Don't come back.

45
00:06:25,564 --> 00:06:28,464
When I was little,

46
00:06:28,564 --> 00:06:30,464
I used to stare
at daddy's picture,

47
00:06:30,564 --> 00:06:33,463
try to remember him.

48
00:06:33,563 --> 00:06:35,463
Tried to place the picture

49
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:37,563
so his eyes
would look into mine.

50
00:06:39,563 --> 00:06:42,463
They never did.

51
00:06:42,563 --> 00:06:44,563
They always looked past me.

52
00:06:53,563 --> 00:06:56,463
Do you remember him?

53
00:06:56,563 --> 00:06:58,563
Do you know why daddy ran away?

54
00:07:02,313 --> 00:07:03,463
No one talks about it.

55
00:07:03,563 --> 00:07:06,562
I don't even think about him.

56
00:07:33,312 --> 00:07:34,462
She's leaving.

57
00:07:34,562 --> 00:07:37,561
Again?

58
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,460
She's got a suitcase.

59
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,560
No. No!

60
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,559
I'll send money
for Cat and Journey.

61
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,459
They're better off here.

62
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:47,459
It's not good enough, Min.

63
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:49,559
I'll call.

64
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:52,559
Mom.

65
00:09:01,558 --> 00:09:03,458
I'll come back, Journey.

66
00:09:03,558 --> 00:09:07,558
No, son, she won't be back.

67
00:09:26,558 --> 00:09:28,558
Mama?

68
00:10:18,556 --> 00:10:21,456
She won't be back.

69
00:10:21,556 --> 00:10:22,706
Oof!

70
00:10:31,555 --> 00:10:33,555
Oh!

71
00:10:35,555 --> 00:10:37,555
Oh, no.

72
00:10:58,555 --> 00:11:00,454
Lottie?

73
00:11:00,554 --> 00:11:01,704
Lott...

74
00:11:06,554 --> 00:11:09,554
Ohh...

75
00:11:11,554 --> 00:11:16,454
That's all we have
of Min and the children.

76
00:11:16,554 --> 00:11:18,554
Oh, Lottie.

77
00:11:21,554 --> 00:11:23,454
Cat?

78
00:11:23,554 --> 00:11:25,554
Cat?

79
00:11:57,304 --> 00:11:58,454
Where you going?

80
00:11:58,554 --> 00:12:00,452
I'm rearranging my life.

81
00:12:00,552 --> 00:12:02,452
I don't want my camera,
mama's recorder,

82
00:12:02,552 --> 00:12:05,452
and most everything
else. Including meat.

83
00:12:05,552 --> 00:12:07,452
I spent yesterday
looking into a cow's eyes,

84
00:12:07,552 --> 00:12:10,452
and I will be a vegetarian.

85
00:12:10,552 --> 00:12:12,552
Which cow?

86
00:12:23,552 --> 00:12:24,702
Tired of this, Cat?

87
00:12:28,552 --> 00:12:31,451
My pictures are so...

88
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:33,551
Boring?

89
00:12:35,551 --> 00:12:37,451
You're right, grandpa.

90
00:12:37,551 --> 00:12:39,551
You take it.

91
00:12:43,302 --> 00:12:44,452
Journey?

92
00:12:44,552 --> 00:12:46,451
I know the farm.

93
00:12:46,551 --> 00:12:48,451
Why would I need to
take pictures of it?

94
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:50,551
Oh.

95
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,450
Oh, look.
A recorder.

96
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,450
I used to play the recorder.

97
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,550
A long time ago, remember?

98
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,550
Oh, look.

99
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,550
That's mama's shirt.

100
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:31,449
Journey...

101
00:13:31,549 --> 00:13:32,450
Come here.

102
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,449
Come here, come here.

103
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:35,449
Cat, come here.

104
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:36,699
It's o.K.

105
00:13:39,549 --> 00:13:43,449
Lottie?

106
00:13:43,549 --> 00:13:45,549
Turn around.

107
00:14:42,547 --> 00:14:45,447
Good morning, Journey.

108
00:14:45,547 --> 00:14:48,447
Looking for your grandfather?

109
00:14:48,547 --> 00:14:49,697
No.

110
00:14:54,547 --> 00:14:56,547
Where is he?

111
00:14:58,546 --> 00:15:01,546
Taking pictures of cow pies.

112
00:15:17,546 --> 00:15:19,546
Sorry about your mama, Journey.

113
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,546
She'll be back.

114
00:16:36,543 --> 00:16:38,443
Oh, Marcus!

115
00:16:38,543 --> 00:16:39,761
I'm getting
really tired of that.

116
00:16:57,292 --> 00:16:58,442
Hi, Cat.

117
00:16:58,542 --> 00:16:59,692
Thank you.

118
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:22,542
No return address.

119
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,443
I expect she won't...

120
00:17:25,543 --> 00:17:28,441
Marcus...

121
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:29,691
Let it be.

122
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,441
I think...

123
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:35,442
That what grandpa means...

124
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:38,441
Is that there'll be
money in the envelope,

125
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:39,442
not words,

126
00:17:39,542 --> 00:17:41,441
not the words you want.

127
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:44,541
You'll be disappointed.

128
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:52,441
I'm not disappointed!
I'm not!

129
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,441
There are words.

130
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,441
Our names are there.
Our names are words.

131
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:58,440
Journey, you keep the money.

132
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,440
Do what you want with it.

133
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,540
I'll put it in the bank.

134
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,441
I'll start a child account.

135
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:09,440
When mama tells where she is,
we could visit.

136
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,441
She forgot the return address.

137
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:13,540
She forgot. That's all.

138
00:18:32,539 --> 00:18:34,539
Oh, Journey.

139
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:50,439
Why do you do that?

140
00:18:50,539 --> 00:18:52,539
Why?

141
00:18:55,539 --> 00:18:57,438
'Cause he needs to.

142
00:18:57,538 --> 00:18:59,438
I don't understand.

143
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,538
I know, honey, I know.

144
00:20:30,535 --> 00:20:31,685
Journey?

145
00:20:33,535 --> 00:20:35,535
Come here.

146
00:20:40,535 --> 00:20:42,535
Let's look at these.

147
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,535
There's your great-uncle Tom.

148
00:20:50,535 --> 00:20:53,435
Oh, and your cousin Bob.

149
00:20:53,535 --> 00:20:54,685
Remember him?

150
00:21:00,285 --> 00:21:01,435
Ahh.

151
00:21:01,535 --> 00:21:04,434
And that's me...

152
00:21:04,534 --> 00:21:07,534
When I was Cat's age.

153
00:21:11,534 --> 00:21:14,434
And that's me again.

154
00:21:14,534 --> 00:21:18,534
Now, that was taken
on a long-ago 4th of July.

155
00:21:19,534 --> 00:21:21,434
You look happy.

156
00:21:21,534 --> 00:21:22,435
I was happy.

157
00:21:22,535 --> 00:21:24,534
That was the day
I met your grandpa.

158
00:21:28,533 --> 00:21:30,433
Aw, and there's your mother...

159
00:21:30,533 --> 00:21:35,433
Same age, same date,
many years later.

160
00:21:35,533 --> 00:21:37,433
Hey, that's aunt Lacy
and uncle Maynard.

161
00:21:37,533 --> 00:21:38,434
That's right.

162
00:21:38,534 --> 00:21:41,433
Your grandpa took that picture.

163
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:43,533
It's a good picture.

164
00:21:45,533 --> 00:21:47,533
Except for mama.

165
00:21:49,533 --> 00:21:51,533
Journey.

166
00:21:53,533 --> 00:21:56,432
Now, your mama always
wanted to be somewhere else.

167
00:21:56,532 --> 00:22:00,432
Well, now she is...

168
00:22:00,532 --> 00:22:02,532
Somewhere else.

169
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:25,429
Wait!

170
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:26,430
Mama!

171
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,529
Wait, mama!

172
00:23:30,529 --> 00:23:32,529
Wait!

173
00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:37,529
Mama, wait! Mama!

174
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:25,427
Do you ever come through
the door like everyone else?

175
00:24:25,527 --> 00:24:27,527
No.

176
00:24:28,527 --> 00:24:30,427
Here we go, Emmet.

177
00:24:30,527 --> 00:24:33,427
Good boy.

178
00:24:33,527 --> 00:24:36,427
Emmet, hi.

179
00:24:36,527 --> 00:24:38,527
Hey, guys.

180
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:41,428
How are you?

181
00:24:41,528 --> 00:24:43,527
Will you marry me?

182
00:24:44,527 --> 00:24:47,427
That's the first time
this month he's asked.

183
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:48,428
He'll get tired of it.

184
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:50,427
Routine is good.

185
00:24:50,527 --> 00:24:51,677
My mother says so.

186
00:24:56,526 --> 00:24:57,676
So?

187
00:25:02,526 --> 00:25:04,526
She's gone.

188
00:25:11,526 --> 00:25:14,426
He looks like you, Cooper.

189
00:25:14,526 --> 00:25:17,426
Oh, yeah.

190
00:25:17,526 --> 00:25:19,426
That's what everybody says.

191
00:25:19,526 --> 00:25:24,426
We all look alike,
the whole family down through the ages.

192
00:25:24,526 --> 00:25:27,425
Toss our pictures in the air.

193
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:29,425
When they came down,
they'd all look like me.

194
00:25:29,525 --> 00:25:32,425
Well, I don't look like anyone.

195
00:25:32,525 --> 00:25:34,525
Is that you, Cat?

196
00:25:36,525 --> 00:25:38,425
No.

197
00:25:38,525 --> 00:25:41,425
That's mama,
mama a long time ago.

198
00:25:41,525 --> 00:25:43,425
Oh, it's just that...

199
00:25:43,525 --> 00:25:45,425
We look so much
the same, I know.

200
00:25:45,525 --> 00:25:47,425
Yeah.

201
00:25:47,525 --> 00:25:50,425
There. That's
who I look like.

202
00:25:50,525 --> 00:25:53,425
Look. See?

203
00:25:53,525 --> 00:25:54,426
Yeah, I do.

204
00:25:54,526 --> 00:25:56,424
I do.

205
00:25:56,524 --> 00:25:57,674
Sounds like a wedding.

206
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:01,524
But you look like mama, too.

207
00:26:05,524 --> 00:26:09,424
Well, well, look
who's come for a visit.

208
00:26:09,524 --> 00:26:10,424
Hello, Cooper.

209
00:26:10,524 --> 00:26:11,425
Hey.

210
00:26:11,525 --> 00:26:13,424
Would you hold that, Journey?

211
00:26:13,524 --> 00:26:16,424
Oh, Emmet. Well,
nice to see you again.

212
00:26:16,524 --> 00:26:18,424
How's my boy?

213
00:26:18,524 --> 00:26:19,425
Ha ha ha!

214
00:26:19,525 --> 00:26:21,424
Yeah. Come on.

215
00:26:21,524 --> 00:26:23,424
Yeah.

216
00:26:23,524 --> 00:26:25,423
How are you?

217
00:26:25,523 --> 00:26:26,424
Sorry.

218
00:26:26,524 --> 00:26:28,423
I didn't mean to do that.

219
00:26:28,523 --> 00:26:30,423
No, no.
That's all right.

220
00:26:30,523 --> 00:26:32,523
You can take as many
pictures as you want.

221
00:26:36,523 --> 00:26:39,423
Trot, trot to Boston,

222
00:26:39,523 --> 00:26:41,423
trot, trot to Lynn,

223
00:26:41,523 --> 00:26:42,424
watch out, little boy,

224
00:26:42,524 --> 00:26:45,423
or you'll fall in.

225
00:26:45,523 --> 00:26:47,423
Trot, trot to Boston,

226
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:49,423
trot, trot to Lynn,

227
00:26:49,523 --> 00:26:51,423
watch out, little boy,

228
00:26:51,523 --> 00:26:53,423
or you'll fall in.

229
00:26:53,523 --> 00:26:56,422
Trot, trot to Boston,

230
00:26:56,522 --> 00:26:57,423
trot, trot to Lynn,

231
00:26:57,523 --> 00:26:59,422
watch out, little boy,

232
00:26:59,522 --> 00:27:02,422
or you'll fall in.

233
00:27:02,522 --> 00:27:04,957
Teenaged Journey, narrating:
<i>We're in the garden, up and down I go,</i>

234
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:08,422
<i>my eyes fastened on white
buttons against a blue shirt.</i>

235
00:27:08,522 --> 00:27:10,422
<i>The smell of summer
fills the air,</i>

236
00:27:10,522 --> 00:27:12,422
<i>and voices rising and falling</i>

237
00:27:12,522 --> 00:27:14,422
<i>and laughter.</i>

238
00:27:14,522 --> 00:27:15,423
<i>Watch out, little boy.</i>

239
00:27:15,523 --> 00:27:17,422
<i>Or you'll...</i>

240
00:27:17,522 --> 00:27:21,422
<i>I look at the shirt button
and then the neck,</i>

241
00:27:21,522 --> 00:27:23,422
<i>but there's no face.</i>

242
00:27:23,522 --> 00:27:27,521
<i>It's my father, I know,
but there's no face.</i>

243
00:27:29,521 --> 00:27:33,421
Ha ha ha!

244
00:27:33,521 --> 00:27:35,421
Ha ha ha!

245
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:36,422
Oh, yeah.

246
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:38,421
Ha ha ha.

247
00:27:38,521 --> 00:27:40,421
Yeah. There you go,
big fella.

248
00:27:40,521 --> 00:27:42,521
Ah.

249
00:27:46,521 --> 00:27:49,421
Things don't look the
same through the camera,

250
00:27:49,521 --> 00:27:52,421
not the way they
are in real life.

251
00:27:52,521 --> 00:27:56,420
Sometimes, and sometimes
pictures show us

252
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,421
what is really there.

253
00:27:57,521 --> 00:27:59,420
How can that be?

254
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,421
I don't know, Journey.

255
00:28:00,521 --> 00:28:03,420
Maybe that's why
people take pictures...

256
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,420
To see what's there.

257
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,520
What do you mean,
"to see what is there"?

258
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,670
Look.

259
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,419
What does he mean?

260
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:28,419
That could be you, Journey.

261
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:30,419
Is that daddy?
It's him, isn't it?

262
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:31,420
Two of a kind.

263
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,419
It's grandfather, Journey.

264
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:35,419
Grandfather.

265
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:38,419
And you look like him.

266
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:40,419
You are like him.

267
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:42,519
No.

268
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:47,419
Cat, I need some milk.

269
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:48,420
Coming!

270
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,419
I'll come with you.

271
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:51,420
Come on, Emmet.

272
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,519
Let's go see
Journey's grandmother.

273
00:29:01,518 --> 00:29:03,518
No.

274
00:29:06,518 --> 00:29:08,418
You've got to try.

275
00:29:08,518 --> 00:29:10,418
I can't.

276
00:29:10,518 --> 00:29:11,418
You've got to.

277
00:29:11,518 --> 00:29:12,419
Stop arguing.

278
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:14,418
We're not arguing.
We're having a dialogue.

279
00:29:14,518 --> 00:29:16,418
It sounds like arguing.

280
00:29:16,518 --> 00:29:18,418
I don't know
how to drive to town.

281
00:29:18,518 --> 00:29:19,418
You'll learn.

282
00:29:19,518 --> 00:29:20,418
I don't want to learn.

283
00:29:20,518 --> 00:29:21,418
You'll be glad someday

284
00:29:21,518 --> 00:29:22,419
to know how to drive!

285
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:24,417
Why?

286
00:29:24,517 --> 00:29:25,418
I'm an old man.

287
00:29:25,518 --> 00:29:27,417
If I die behind the wheel,

288
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:29,417
you'll be able to drive.

289
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:31,417
I'm only a boy.

290
00:29:31,517 --> 00:29:32,418
So drive like a boy.

291
00:29:32,518 --> 00:29:34,417
Just a minute.
Come on over here.

292
00:29:34,517 --> 00:29:36,417
Stand there.

293
00:29:36,517 --> 00:29:37,418
Not another family picture.

294
00:29:37,518 --> 00:29:39,417
Yes. Lottie!

295
00:29:39,517 --> 00:29:41,417
Lottie!

296
00:29:41,517 --> 00:29:43,517
A picture, Lottie.
Get a hat.

297
00:29:46,517 --> 00:29:49,417
It's hot. Why
are we doing this?

298
00:29:49,517 --> 00:29:50,418
I'm not an actor, Marcus.

299
00:29:50,518 --> 00:29:52,417
I'm a hot, old woman.

300
00:29:52,517 --> 00:29:54,516
You're a fetching
hot, old woman.

301
00:29:56,516 --> 00:29:58,416
Timer's set.

302
00:29:58,516 --> 00:30:01,416
10, 9, 8...

303
00:30:01,516 --> 00:30:02,416
7...
Why?

304
00:30:02,516 --> 00:30:03,416
6...

305
00:30:03,516 --> 00:30:04,417
5...

306
00:30:04,517 --> 00:30:06,416
4...

307
00:30:06,516 --> 00:30:07,416
3...

308
00:30:07,516 --> 00:30:08,417
Don't look up.

309
00:30:08,517 --> 00:30:10,516
2, 1.

310
00:30:17,267 --> 00:30:18,417
Oh, no.

311
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:20,416
Never mind.

312
00:30:20,516 --> 00:30:22,516
Let's get going.

313
00:30:24,515 --> 00:30:27,415
I've got rolls
of film to drop off,

314
00:30:27,515 --> 00:30:29,415
pictures to pick up.

315
00:30:29,515 --> 00:30:33,415
And, uh, other things
to get in town.

316
00:30:33,515 --> 00:30:34,416
Other things?
What other things?

317
00:30:34,516 --> 00:30:38,415
Things. Photo things.

318
00:30:38,515 --> 00:30:39,416
Come on, Journey.

319
00:30:39,516 --> 00:30:43,415
I'll drive
when we get into town.

320
00:30:43,515 --> 00:30:45,515
You drive now.

321
00:30:48,515 --> 00:30:50,415
I can't reach the pedals.

322
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,415
I can't even see out.

323
00:30:52,515 --> 00:30:54,414
Here. Sit on this pillow.

324
00:30:54,514 --> 00:30:56,514
Wait. This is
the brake.

325
00:30:58,265 --> 00:30:59,415
No. The clutch.
The clutch!

326
00:30:59,515 --> 00:31:02,414
You said...
I know. I know.

327
00:31:02,514 --> 00:31:04,514
Ha ha ha.

328
00:31:07,514 --> 00:31:10,414
I remember when he
taught Min how to drive.

329
00:31:10,514 --> 00:31:12,414
Oh, that was some yelling.

330
00:31:12,514 --> 00:31:14,414
Lots of yelling.

331
00:31:14,514 --> 00:31:15,415
Min never did take to anyone

332
00:31:15,515 --> 00:31:18,414
telling her what to do,
especially Marcus.

333
00:31:18,514 --> 00:31:20,514
Especially Marcus.

334
00:31:22,264 --> 00:31:23,414
It's funny how some people

335
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:25,413
bump up against each other.

336
00:31:25,513 --> 00:31:29,413
Yeah, but they did all the time,

337
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:32,413
even when Min was little.

338
00:31:32,513 --> 00:31:35,413
Marcus has his way.

339
00:31:35,513 --> 00:31:38,413
She never liked his way.

340
00:31:38,513 --> 00:31:39,414
Well, he never liked
her way, either, Lottie.

341
00:31:39,514 --> 00:31:42,513
Ha ha! That's true.

342
00:31:48,513 --> 00:31:50,513
Maybe she'll come back.

343
00:31:52,513 --> 00:31:54,512
Maybe not.

344
00:32:01,512 --> 00:32:04,512
Maybe it's better
if she stays away.

345
00:32:16,512 --> 00:32:17,662
Hello?

346
00:32:22,512 --> 00:32:23,662
Hello?

347
00:32:29,511 --> 00:32:30,661
Min?

348
00:32:40,511 --> 00:32:42,511
Here.

349
00:32:44,511 --> 00:32:46,411
You sure you wanna stay?

350
00:32:46,511 --> 00:32:48,411
You're a good worker.

351
00:32:48,511 --> 00:32:50,511
Gotta move on.

352
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:54,410
Maybe you'll come
through here again.

353
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:57,510
Thank you.

354
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:49,409
That's it.
He's doing all right.

355
00:33:49,509 --> 00:33:50,410
I can't do this.

356
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,408
Why do you have a car like this?

357
00:33:52,508 --> 00:33:54,408
I love this car.

358
00:33:54,508 --> 00:33:55,409
There aren't many left.

359
00:33:55,509 --> 00:33:57,408
They're extinct, like
the passenger pigeon.

360
00:33:57,508 --> 00:33:58,409
That's what grandma says.

361
00:33:58,509 --> 00:34:00,408
Oh, does she?

362
00:34:00,508 --> 00:34:02,408
Well. Ha ha!

363
00:34:02,508 --> 00:34:03,409
Hold it steady now.

364
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:05,408
Come on.
Hold it steady.

365
00:34:05,508 --> 00:34:08,408
If we crash,
he'll photograph it as it happens.

366
00:34:08,508 --> 00:34:11,408
Hold it there now.
That's right.

367
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:13,408
Good.

368
00:34:13,508 --> 00:34:14,408
Hey!

369
00:34:14,508 --> 00:34:15,409
Millie!

370
00:34:15,509 --> 00:34:17,408
Hey!

371
00:34:17,508 --> 00:34:19,408
Hey!

372
00:34:19,508 --> 00:34:20,658
Oh!

373
00:34:22,507 --> 00:34:24,507
Oh.

374
00:34:27,507 --> 00:34:29,407
Hey, jed's back!

375
00:34:29,507 --> 00:34:30,407
Hi!

376
00:34:30,507 --> 00:34:31,657
Hey, Marcus!

377
00:34:37,507 --> 00:34:39,407
Hey, grandpa, look.

378
00:34:39,507 --> 00:34:41,407
Quick! Take a picture.

379
00:34:41,507 --> 00:34:42,408
Oh. Oh!

380
00:34:42,508 --> 00:34:44,507
Cooper! Hey!

381
00:34:48,507 --> 00:34:50,407
Ahh.

382
00:34:50,507 --> 00:34:51,407
You know?

383
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:52,407
Huh?

384
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,406
I bet that picture of all of us

385
00:34:54,506 --> 00:34:57,406
looking at the airplane,
it'll be fine.

386
00:34:57,506 --> 00:35:00,406
I think so, too, Journey.

387
00:35:00,506 --> 00:35:01,656
Two of a kind.

388
00:35:20,506 --> 00:35:22,405
Come on!
It's coming down harder!

389
00:35:22,505 --> 00:35:24,405
Hurry up. Let's go.

390
00:35:24,505 --> 00:35:26,405
Hurry up, you guys.

391
00:35:26,505 --> 00:35:28,405
I am hurrying.

392
00:35:28,505 --> 00:35:29,406
We can't get 'em all.

393
00:35:29,506 --> 00:35:31,405
Don't we have enough?

394
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:34,505
Come on, Cat.
Come on, Journey.

395
00:35:36,505 --> 00:35:38,405
Come on, boy.
Let's get inside.

396
00:35:38,505 --> 00:35:40,405
It's wet.

397
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:42,405
Oh, let's get in there.

398
00:35:42,505 --> 00:35:43,406
Hurry up.

399
00:35:43,506 --> 00:35:45,505
Journey, move faster, go, quick.

400
00:35:49,256 --> 00:35:50,406
Whoa!

401
00:35:50,506 --> 00:35:53,404
Oh, let's get inside.

402
00:35:53,504 --> 00:35:55,404
Here we are.

403
00:35:55,504 --> 00:35:57,404
Saved from the rain.

404
00:35:57,504 --> 00:35:58,405
Well done.

405
00:35:58,505 --> 00:36:00,404
Oh, smell those.

406
00:36:00,504 --> 00:36:03,404
Oh, that's a wonderful smell,
isn't it?

407
00:36:03,504 --> 00:36:04,405
Oh, yeah.

408
00:36:04,505 --> 00:36:06,404
Well, there are ants everywhere.

409
00:36:06,504 --> 00:36:07,404
There are, yeah.

410
00:36:07,504 --> 00:36:08,404
Well, just regard them

411
00:36:08,504 --> 00:36:09,404
like they're sightseers

412
00:36:09,504 --> 00:36:10,405
or like they're visitors.

413
00:36:10,505 --> 00:36:12,404
Marcus...

414
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,404
It's new.

415
00:36:14,504 --> 00:36:16,504
I bought it in town.

416
00:36:21,503 --> 00:36:23,503
Ha ha.

417
00:36:26,503 --> 00:36:28,403
Marcus,
I have spots in front of my eyes.

418
00:36:28,503 --> 00:36:30,403
I can't see.

419
00:36:30,503 --> 00:36:32,403
Go away and be a farmer,
will you?

420
00:36:32,503 --> 00:36:35,403
I'm a farmer who
takes pictures, Lottie.

421
00:36:35,503 --> 00:36:37,403
I'm a photographer farmer.

422
00:36:37,503 --> 00:36:39,403
Ha ha ha.

423
00:36:39,503 --> 00:36:40,404
Marcus, you've got to learn

424
00:36:40,504 --> 00:36:43,503
you cannot always have
things your own way.

425
00:37:24,501 --> 00:37:26,501
Maybe the chickens.

426
00:38:59,498 --> 00:39:01,398
You moved the camera.

427
00:39:01,498 --> 00:39:03,398
That's why the edges are fuzzy.

428
00:39:03,498 --> 00:39:05,398
It's not a good picture,
I guess.

429
00:39:05,498 --> 00:39:08,398
Journey, it's
a wonderful picture.

430
00:39:08,498 --> 00:39:10,398
But I moved the camera.

431
00:39:10,498 --> 00:39:13,398
You did, but you
see how Emmet and I

432
00:39:13,498 --> 00:39:15,398
look like we're
the only ones there,

433
00:39:15,498 --> 00:39:19,398
how we look like we're
wrapped in a cocoon,

434
00:39:19,498 --> 00:39:21,397
away from the rest of the world?

435
00:39:21,497 --> 00:39:23,397
See how the edge is framed?

436
00:39:23,497 --> 00:39:27,397
Yeah, but it's not perfect.

437
00:39:27,497 --> 00:39:28,398
Perfect?

438
00:39:28,498 --> 00:39:30,397
What's perfect?

439
00:39:30,497 --> 00:39:32,397
Journey...

440
00:39:32,497 --> 00:39:35,397
Things don't have to be
perfect to make them fine.

441
00:39:35,497 --> 00:39:37,397
Now, that goes for pictures,

442
00:39:37,497 --> 00:39:39,397
and that goes for life.

443
00:39:39,497 --> 00:39:42,497
Things could be good enough.

444
00:39:45,497 --> 00:39:47,397
Grandfather...

445
00:39:47,497 --> 00:39:48,398
Hmm?

446
00:39:48,498 --> 00:39:50,396
Do you think mama left

447
00:39:50,496 --> 00:39:53,396
because I wasn't good enough?

448
00:39:53,496 --> 00:39:55,396
No.

449
00:39:55,496 --> 00:39:58,396
No, Journey.

450
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:00,396
You know that
I tell you the truth,

451
00:40:00,496 --> 00:40:03,396
even when you
don't like to hear it.

452
00:40:03,496 --> 00:40:06,396
Sometimes you tell me the truth.

453
00:40:06,496 --> 00:40:08,396
You say that mama
won't come back,

454
00:40:08,496 --> 00:40:10,396
and I know she will.

455
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,397
That wasn't the truth.

456
00:40:11,497 --> 00:40:15,396
You need someone to blame,
Journey, is that it?

457
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,396
Well, here's an important truth.

458
00:40:17,496 --> 00:40:20,395
It is not your fault.

459
00:40:20,495 --> 00:40:21,396
It's not all mama's fault.

460
00:40:21,496 --> 00:40:25,395
No. I can see that
you can't blame Min,

461
00:40:25,495 --> 00:40:26,396
and that's all right.

462
00:40:26,496 --> 00:40:28,395
I remember things.

463
00:40:28,495 --> 00:40:30,395
I remember
"trot, trot to Boston."

464
00:40:30,495 --> 00:40:32,395
I do.

465
00:40:32,495 --> 00:40:35,395
Oh, I'm not surprised
that you remember.

466
00:40:35,495 --> 00:40:37,395
You were very little,

467
00:40:37,495 --> 00:40:41,395
but you wanted to hear
that rhyme over and over.

468
00:40:41,495 --> 00:40:42,396
I remember I sat on daddy's
lap before he went away.

469
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,395
I remember his buttons,

470
00:40:44,495 --> 00:40:48,395
that he held my hands
and wouldn't let me fall.

471
00:40:48,495 --> 00:40:50,394
Mama and papa kept me safe

472
00:40:50,494 --> 00:40:52,394
and cared for me until you...

473
00:40:52,494 --> 00:40:54,394
Until I made them go away?

474
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:57,494
You think I did that?

475
00:40:59,494 --> 00:41:02,394
Where are the pictures?
I want to see them.

476
00:41:02,494 --> 00:41:03,395
What pictures?

477
00:41:03,495 --> 00:41:06,394
Of papa, mama, me, and Cat

478
00:41:06,494 --> 00:41:08,394
when we were babies, like Emmet,

479
00:41:08,494 --> 00:41:10,394
when I was on papa's knees
and he sang to me.

480
00:41:10,494 --> 00:41:11,395
There weren't many.

481
00:41:11,495 --> 00:41:13,394
I don't need many.

482
00:41:13,494 --> 00:41:15,394
They're gone.

483
00:41:15,494 --> 00:41:17,394
Gone? You mean
mama took them?

484
00:41:17,494 --> 00:41:19,394
The truth?

485
00:41:19,494 --> 00:41:20,394
Yes.

486
00:41:20,494 --> 00:41:22,393
Did she take them?

487
00:41:22,493 --> 00:41:23,394
No, Journey.

488
00:41:23,494 --> 00:41:25,493
Your mama tore them up.

489
00:41:59,492 --> 00:42:00,642
Marcus?

490
00:42:03,243 --> 00:42:04,393
He blames me.

491
00:42:04,493 --> 00:42:07,392
Oh, he blames you.
You blame her.

492
00:42:07,492 --> 00:42:09,392
All this blame.

493
00:42:09,492 --> 00:42:11,392
How could she
leave the children?

494
00:42:11,492 --> 00:42:14,492
How could she do that?

495
00:42:18,492 --> 00:42:21,491
I don't know.

496
00:42:33,491 --> 00:42:36,391
Do you remember when
min used to sit on my lap...

497
00:42:36,491 --> 00:42:39,391
When she was little?

498
00:42:39,491 --> 00:42:41,391
She'd stay for a while,

499
00:42:41,491 --> 00:42:45,391
and then she wandered.

500
00:42:45,491 --> 00:42:49,390
Remember we'd find her
way down the road,

501
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:51,390
way out in the Meadow,

502
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:54,390
as if she was going away?

503
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:57,490
As if she was going away then.

504
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:01,390
Oh, I don't know, Marcus.

505
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:03,490
I... I don't know.

506
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:16,390
I loved her when she was little.

507
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:18,390
Yeah.

508
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:20,389
You're trying
not to love her now,

509
00:43:20,489 --> 00:43:22,489
just like Journey's
trying not to love you.

510
00:44:02,488 --> 00:44:04,388
I don't believe
you're sick, Journey.

511
00:44:04,488 --> 00:44:05,389
If you are,

512
00:44:05,489 --> 00:44:08,388
you like us to bring you
ginger ale and soup.

513
00:44:08,488 --> 00:44:09,389
I have a sore throat.

514
00:44:09,489 --> 00:44:11,388
Yeah, let's see.

515
00:44:11,488 --> 00:44:13,388
I have a temperature, too.

516
00:44:13,488 --> 00:44:14,389
How many quilts
do you have here?

517
00:44:14,489 --> 00:44:18,388
1, 2, 3... a quilt, bedspread.

518
00:44:18,488 --> 00:44:19,388
You've got five blankets.
It's summer.

519
00:44:19,488 --> 00:44:21,387
You may turn into a butterfly.

520
00:44:21,487 --> 00:44:23,387
Cat...

521
00:44:23,487 --> 00:44:27,487
Mama tore up our pictures.

522
00:44:30,487 --> 00:44:31,637
I know.

523
00:44:34,237 --> 00:44:35,387
Cat!

524
00:44:35,487 --> 00:44:36,388
You're not sick, Journey!

525
00:44:36,488 --> 00:44:38,387
You're hiding out.

526
00:44:38,487 --> 00:44:41,487
You always hide out
when things go wrong.

527
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:48,637
Here! Listen
to the music.

528
00:45:29,485 --> 00:45:31,385
Hi.

529
00:45:31,485 --> 00:45:32,635
Hi.

530
00:45:34,485 --> 00:45:36,385
You feeling better?

531
00:45:36,485 --> 00:45:37,386
Cat made me get up.

532
00:45:37,486 --> 00:45:41,485
Cat's a woman of action.

533
00:45:42,485 --> 00:45:45,385
She don't believe much
in introspection.

534
00:45:45,485 --> 00:45:48,384
Introspection?

535
00:45:48,484 --> 00:45:49,385
That's what you've been doing

536
00:45:49,485 --> 00:45:51,384
for the past two days,

537
00:45:51,484 --> 00:45:52,385
thinking mostly about yourself.

538
00:45:52,485 --> 00:45:55,384
You see, Cat...

539
00:45:55,484 --> 00:45:58,384
She believes
that if she keeps busy,

540
00:45:58,484 --> 00:46:01,384
all of her problems
will just go away.

541
00:46:01,484 --> 00:46:03,384
Does that work?

542
00:46:03,484 --> 00:46:06,484
No more than thinking works.

543
00:46:08,484 --> 00:46:11,384
But if you notice,
my garden is... what?

544
00:46:11,484 --> 00:46:13,384
Twice the size it was last year.

545
00:46:13,484 --> 00:46:16,384
We all do the best we can.

546
00:46:16,484 --> 00:46:18,383
Your sister and I,

547
00:46:18,483 --> 00:46:22,483
we garden ourselves
into a kind of madness.

548
00:46:23,483 --> 00:46:27,483
You think yourself
into a sore throat.

549
00:46:29,483 --> 00:46:31,483
And your grandpa takes pictures.

550
00:46:37,483 --> 00:46:40,483
Ha ha ha!

551
00:46:46,483 --> 00:46:49,382
He's going to take
a picture of us now,

552
00:46:49,482 --> 00:46:50,383
that old buzzard.

553
00:46:50,483 --> 00:46:53,382
How do you know?
He didn't look here.

554
00:46:53,482 --> 00:46:54,383
Oh, yes, he did.

555
00:46:54,483 --> 00:46:57,482
I saw his eyes roll to the side.

556
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,383
Why are we whispering?

557
00:47:00,483 --> 00:47:02,382
I don't know,

558
00:47:02,482 --> 00:47:05,382
but I know I'm the smartest
woman on this porch.

559
00:47:05,482 --> 00:47:08,382
When he takes the picture,
we'll cover our face.

560
00:47:08,482 --> 00:47:10,382
1, 2, 3...

561
00:47:10,482 --> 00:47:12,482
Ha ha ha!

562
00:47:20,481 --> 00:47:22,481
He is such a noodle, isn't he?

563
00:47:25,481 --> 00:47:26,631
Grandma...

564
00:47:29,481 --> 00:47:32,481
Why did mama do it,
tear up the pictures?

565
00:47:34,481 --> 00:47:36,381
Journey, I've told you before.

566
00:47:36,481 --> 00:47:38,381
I can't speak for Min.

567
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:41,381
I'll have to ask her
when I see her.

568
00:47:41,481 --> 00:47:43,381
Come here.

569
00:47:43,481 --> 00:47:45,381
Oh, I hope you get to do that.

570
00:47:45,481 --> 00:47:48,480
I really do.

571
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,380
Grandfather shouldn't
have told me.

572
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,381
He shouldn't have told me

573
00:47:57,481 --> 00:47:59,380
that mama tore up the pictures.

574
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:02,380
Journey, you asked.

575
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,380
It's funny sometimes how we
just get angry at the wrong person,

576
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,630
you know?

577
00:48:31,479 --> 00:48:35,379
I could have a sore throat.
I could have a temperature.

578
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:37,479
Do you hear me?

579
00:49:04,478 --> 00:49:07,378
There you go.

580
00:49:07,478 --> 00:49:09,378
Up we go.

581
00:49:09,478 --> 00:49:10,379
Oop! No more.

582
00:49:10,479 --> 00:49:13,378
Scoop the new... ah, get away!

583
00:49:13,478 --> 00:49:14,628
Emmet.

584
00:49:16,228 --> 00:49:17,378
Here we go, Emmet.

585
00:49:17,478 --> 00:49:19,477
Applesauce.
It's your favorite.

586
00:49:20,228 --> 00:49:21,378
Here we go.
Open up.

587
00:49:21,478 --> 00:49:23,377
Here it comes.

588
00:49:23,477 --> 00:49:24,378
All right.

589
00:49:24,478 --> 00:49:26,477
Good boy.

590
00:49:32,477 --> 00:49:36,377
There we are.
Look. That's you, Millie.

591
00:49:36,477 --> 00:49:38,377
Oh, Marcus, you rogue,

592
00:49:38,477 --> 00:49:40,377
leaning out
a speeding automobile,

593
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,377
catching me with curlers!

594
00:49:42,477 --> 00:49:45,377
I saw you driving, Journey!

595
00:49:45,477 --> 00:49:46,627
He made me.

596
00:49:48,476 --> 00:49:51,376
Now, here is one
nobody should own.

597
00:49:51,476 --> 00:49:53,476
Oh.

598
00:50:00,476 --> 00:50:03,376
Who took this picture?

599
00:50:03,476 --> 00:50:05,376
You, Marcus?

600
00:50:05,476 --> 00:50:07,376
It was that hot spell, Boone.

601
00:50:07,476 --> 00:50:09,376
I also have a nice close-up
of your underwear.

602
00:50:09,476 --> 00:50:11,476
In a heap by the pond.

603
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:14,376
Marcus, you're
a menace, you are.

604
00:50:14,476 --> 00:50:17,375
I've got pictures I'd
rather do away with.

605
00:50:17,475 --> 00:50:19,375
When I was young and gawky.

606
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:20,376
Aw, when I first
met Mrs. Macdougal,

607
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:23,375
she had her hair all
swept up to one side.

608
00:50:23,475 --> 00:50:25,475
Lot of lipstick and her
cheeks like little apples.

609
00:50:27,225 --> 00:50:28,375
I wanted to look older.

610
00:50:28,475 --> 00:50:29,376
Didn't we want that?

611
00:50:29,476 --> 00:50:31,375
Yeah.

612
00:50:31,475 --> 00:50:33,375
Journey, would you get the pies

613
00:50:33,475 --> 00:50:34,376
from the kitchen table?

614
00:50:34,476 --> 00:50:36,375
Sure.

615
00:50:36,475 --> 00:50:41,375
I have pictures of when
I dyed my hair yellow.

616
00:50:41,475 --> 00:50:42,625
She looked like a sunflower.

617
00:51:04,474 --> 00:51:07,374
Journey, what is it?

618
00:51:07,474 --> 00:51:08,374
Shh!

619
00:51:08,474 --> 00:51:09,375
It's a Cat.

620
00:51:09,475 --> 00:51:12,374
I've never seen that Cat before.

621
00:51:12,474 --> 00:51:13,375
Beautiful.

622
00:51:13,475 --> 00:51:16,373
Who do you think he belongs to?

623
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:17,374
No one.

624
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:19,373
He belongs to no one.

625
00:51:19,473 --> 00:51:21,373
He belongs to someone.

626
00:51:21,473 --> 00:51:24,473
Everything belongs to someone.

627
00:51:26,473 --> 00:51:28,473
Hey, guy, come here.

628
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:35,374
Have you seen Journey?

629
00:51:35,474 --> 00:51:38,373
No, I haven't seen him.

630
00:51:38,473 --> 00:51:40,473
Journey, what is it?

631
00:51:41,224 --> 00:51:42,374
A Cat.

632
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:44,373
A Cat?

633
00:51:44,473 --> 00:51:46,372
Well, that Cat

634
00:51:46,472 --> 00:51:48,472
better not get any of my birds.

635
00:51:50,472 --> 00:51:52,372
That's the only bad thing
about grandma.

636
00:51:52,472 --> 00:51:55,472
She hates cats.

637
00:52:09,472 --> 00:52:11,472
Cooper!

638
00:52:14,472 --> 00:52:15,622
Cooper!

639
00:52:29,471 --> 00:52:31,371
Look.

640
00:52:31,471 --> 00:52:32,621
Careful.

641
00:52:33,471 --> 00:52:36,471
Oh, Cat, get the phone,
will you?

642
00:52:38,471 --> 00:52:39,621
Hello.

643
00:52:44,471 --> 00:52:45,621
No.

644
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:50,470
No, I will not
let you speak to him!

645
00:52:56,470 --> 00:52:59,470
It was no one.

646
00:53:54,468 --> 00:53:56,368
Thanks again, Lottie!
See, y'all!

647
00:53:56,468 --> 00:53:58,468
See ya! Bye, Cat!

648
00:55:42,465 --> 00:55:44,365
Can I do something for you?

649
00:55:44,465 --> 00:55:46,364
No.

650
00:55:46,464 --> 00:55:48,364
Thanks, grandma.
Good night.

651
00:55:48,464 --> 00:55:49,365
Good night.

652
00:55:49,465 --> 00:55:51,464
Good night.

653
00:56:11,215 --> 00:56:12,365
What is it, Journey?

654
00:56:12,465 --> 00:56:14,464
Look.

655
00:56:16,463 --> 00:56:18,363
Oh, look at that.

656
00:56:18,463 --> 00:56:20,463
Well.

657
00:56:21,463 --> 00:56:24,463
Aw, all tuckered out, eh?

658
00:56:26,463 --> 00:56:28,463
Whose Cat is it?

659
00:56:31,463 --> 00:56:33,363
No, Journey.

660
00:56:33,463 --> 00:56:35,363
You know your grandma's
not fond of cats.

661
00:56:35,463 --> 00:56:38,363
She loves her birds.

662
00:56:38,463 --> 00:56:39,364
Well, I love this Cat.

663
00:56:39,464 --> 00:56:42,363
He came to my window.

664
00:56:42,463 --> 00:56:44,463
I think he's mine.

665
00:56:45,462 --> 00:56:47,362
Do not...

666
00:56:47,462 --> 00:56:50,362
Do not name this Cat.

667
00:56:50,462 --> 00:56:53,362
You know the family rules.

668
00:56:53,462 --> 00:56:55,362
If you name it,

669
00:56:55,462 --> 00:56:57,462
you have to take care of it.

670
00:56:59,462 --> 00:57:01,462
If I name it, he's mine.

671
00:57:04,213 --> 00:57:05,363
Oh!

672
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:07,462
Look.

673
00:57:10,462 --> 00:57:14,361
There's a little blood here. Look,
huh?

674
00:57:14,461 --> 00:57:17,361
Oh, see?

675
00:57:17,461 --> 00:57:19,461
A cut on his foot.

676
00:57:20,461 --> 00:57:24,361
Aw, you're really something.

677
00:57:24,461 --> 00:57:27,361
Yes, you are really
a good pussycat.

678
00:57:27,461 --> 00:57:28,362
What's going on in...

679
00:57:28,462 --> 00:57:31,461
Marcus, for heaven's sakes!

680
00:57:32,461 --> 00:57:34,361
Oh!

681
00:57:34,461 --> 00:57:36,361
Have you named him yet?

682
00:57:36,461 --> 00:57:37,611
Marcus.

683
00:57:39,461 --> 00:57:43,361
Lottie, this is
an injured animal.

684
00:57:43,461 --> 00:57:45,360
We have to be humane here.

685
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:48,360
Marcus, you know how
I feel about cats.

686
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:50,360
And cats are not
humane to birds.

687
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:51,361
Grandma?

688
00:57:51,461 --> 00:57:53,360
I need this Cat.

689
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:55,360
Actually, Lottie,

690
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:57,360
it's unfortunate, I know,

691
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:58,361
but Journey has
named the Cat already.

692
00:57:58,461 --> 00:58:00,360
You know the rules.

693
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:03,360
Oh, yeah? What's the name?
What have you named him?

694
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:05,360
Uh, yes...

695
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:08,460
His name is, uh...

696
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:13,360
His name is bloom.

697
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:15,359
Isn't that what you call him,
Journey?

698
00:58:15,459 --> 00:58:17,359
Yes. Bloom.

699
00:58:17,459 --> 00:58:20,359
You just made that up, old man.

700
00:58:20,459 --> 00:58:23,359
You might as well
have called him peony.

701
00:58:23,459 --> 00:58:25,359
Lottie, Journey knows that peony

702
00:58:25,459 --> 00:58:27,459
is no name for a Cat.

703
00:58:30,459 --> 00:58:31,609
Hi.

704
00:58:33,459 --> 00:58:34,609
Mom forgot her sweater and...

705
00:58:39,459 --> 00:58:41,359
Hey, what did you name him?

706
00:58:41,459 --> 00:58:43,359
Bloom.

707
00:58:43,459 --> 00:58:45,458
I'll get the camera!

708
00:58:46,458 --> 00:58:48,358
Such a pretty kitty.

709
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:50,358
So soft.

710
00:58:50,458 --> 00:58:51,608
Yes, you are.

711
00:59:06,458 --> 00:59:08,458
Hmm.

712
00:59:22,457 --> 00:59:23,607
Grandfather?

713
00:59:25,457 --> 00:59:27,357
Thank you.

714
00:59:27,457 --> 00:59:28,607
You're welcome.

715
00:59:34,457 --> 00:59:36,457
So...

716
00:59:37,457 --> 00:59:39,357
How's Lottie taking all this?

717
00:59:39,457 --> 00:59:40,358
Fair to middling.

718
00:59:40,458 --> 00:59:42,357
More fair than middling.

719
00:59:42,457 --> 00:59:44,356
He's a good Cat bird.

720
00:59:44,456 --> 00:59:46,356
He catches mice, not birds.

721
00:59:46,456 --> 00:59:47,357
Mmm.

722
00:59:47,457 --> 00:59:50,356
Oh, boy.

723
00:59:50,456 --> 00:59:54,356
And does Lottie know
that he is a she?

724
00:59:54,456 --> 00:59:56,356
From the looks of it,

725
00:59:56,456 --> 00:59:57,357
about to have a litter.

726
00:59:57,457 --> 00:59:59,356
Not yet.

727
00:59:59,456 --> 01:00:01,356
Well, she will soon.

728
01:00:01,456 --> 01:00:03,356
Congratulations.

729
01:00:03,456 --> 01:00:04,606
You're going to be a papa.

730
01:00:10,456 --> 01:00:12,356
Did you really think

731
01:00:12,456 --> 01:00:13,356
that I didn't know
bloom was female?

732
01:00:13,456 --> 01:00:15,355
You knew?

733
01:00:15,455 --> 01:00:16,356
Grandma knows everything.

734
01:00:16,456 --> 01:00:18,355
Of course I knew.

735
01:00:18,455 --> 01:00:19,356
This means there's going to be

736
01:00:19,456 --> 01:00:21,355
half a dozen
furry little animals

737
01:00:21,455 --> 01:00:22,356
that are going to grow up to be

738
01:00:22,456 --> 01:00:24,355
large, hungry, furry animals

739
01:00:24,455 --> 01:00:25,605
that are going to eat my birds!

740
01:00:26,455 --> 01:00:28,355
Oh, psst! Psst!

741
01:00:28,455 --> 01:00:29,356
She likes you, Lottie.

742
01:00:29,456 --> 01:00:32,455
Oh,
get out of here. There's work to be done.

743
01:00:35,206 --> 01:00:36,356
What about dessert?

744
01:00:36,456 --> 01:00:39,455
The pie is cooling.
Now, go on.

745
01:00:46,454 --> 01:00:48,354
Oh, not another mouse!

746
01:00:48,454 --> 01:00:50,354
You are a filthy cannibal.

747
01:00:50,454 --> 01:00:52,354
She's angry.

748
01:00:52,454 --> 01:00:53,604
Just get out of here, will you?

749
01:01:00,454 --> 01:01:02,454
Do you want a little treat?

750
01:01:04,454 --> 01:01:07,454
You are a beautiful Cat.

751
01:01:10,454 --> 01:01:13,453
Oh, you are beautiful.

752
01:01:16,453 --> 01:01:20,353
You are the best Cat
in the world.

753
01:01:20,453 --> 01:01:22,453
You like that?

754
01:01:52,452 --> 01:01:53,602
Hi.

755
01:02:01,452 --> 01:02:03,452
Be good.

756
01:02:25,451 --> 01:02:28,351
Still no return address.

757
01:02:28,451 --> 01:02:31,351
It's like she left
this postmark path

758
01:02:31,451 --> 01:02:32,601
he can't follow.

759
01:02:35,451 --> 01:02:37,451
She did it to you, too, Cat.

760
01:03:10,450 --> 01:03:12,349
Better run.

761
01:03:12,449 --> 01:03:15,349
Grandfather wants to take
another family picture.

762
01:03:15,449 --> 01:03:17,449
Everybody!

763
01:03:18,449 --> 01:03:19,599
Come on, hurry!

764
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,350
Come on!

765
01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:27,349
Come on, just one picture!

766
01:03:27,449 --> 01:03:29,349
One family picture!

767
01:03:29,449 --> 01:03:31,449
Come on!

768
01:03:59,199 --> 01:04:00,349
Bloom.

769
01:04:00,449 --> 01:04:02,448
Bloom.

770
01:04:07,448 --> 01:04:10,448
I think we're safe.

771
01:04:20,447 --> 01:04:22,347
Trying to hide from me, are you?

772
01:04:22,447 --> 01:04:25,347
Now, I've caught you.
I've caught you.

773
01:04:25,447 --> 01:04:27,347
Come on now.
Come on now.

774
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:29,447
Yes, just one picture.

775
01:04:31,447 --> 01:04:35,347
She didn't take them with her.

776
01:04:35,447 --> 01:04:37,347
She left them here.

777
01:04:37,447 --> 01:04:40,447
She sure destroyed
our family, didn't she?

778
01:04:42,446 --> 01:04:44,446
It looks like murder.

779
01:04:47,446 --> 01:04:49,346
I'm going to fix this, Cat.

780
01:04:49,446 --> 01:04:53,346
I'm going to tape these
pictures back together.

781
01:04:53,446 --> 01:04:54,347
Journey...

782
01:04:54,447 --> 01:04:56,446
It's all right, Lottie.

783
01:04:58,446 --> 01:05:00,346
He has a right
to those pictures.

784
01:05:00,446 --> 01:05:03,446
They're Journey's past.

785
01:06:57,442 --> 01:07:00,342
I'm going to put all these
pictures back together,

786
01:07:00,442 --> 01:07:02,342
and everything will be fine.

787
01:07:02,442 --> 01:07:04,342
It will.

788
01:07:04,442 --> 01:07:06,342
Journey, it's too hard.

789
01:07:06,442 --> 01:07:08,342
It's impossible.

790
01:07:08,442 --> 01:07:10,342
There's hundreds
of pictures here.

791
01:07:10,442 --> 01:07:12,441
Hundreds.

792
01:07:14,441 --> 01:07:16,441
Your cowboy hat looks stupid.

793
01:09:04,438 --> 01:09:11,337
Cat,
she tore the pictures up so small,

794
01:09:11,437 --> 01:09:12,587
can't fix them.

795
01:09:18,437 --> 01:09:20,337
Mom is not coming back.

796
01:09:20,437 --> 01:09:23,437
Is she?

797
01:09:58,436 --> 01:10:00,336
The box is all yours, bloom.

798
01:10:00,436 --> 01:10:02,436
You found it, after all.

799
01:11:21,433 --> 01:11:25,333
Hey, thanks
for bringing my bike.

800
01:11:25,433 --> 01:11:27,333
Sorry...

801
01:11:27,433 --> 01:11:29,333
About what I said to you

802
01:11:29,433 --> 01:11:30,583
about your hat.

803
01:11:35,433 --> 01:11:37,433
You been crying?

804
01:11:38,433 --> 01:11:40,432
Yeah.

805
01:11:43,432 --> 01:11:45,332
Well, then, let's go in.

806
01:11:45,432 --> 01:11:47,432
Mrs. Macdougal's
making breakfast.

807
01:11:48,432 --> 01:11:51,332
Why do you call your mom
Mrs. Macdougal?

808
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:53,332
Well, that's her name.

809
01:11:53,432 --> 01:11:55,432
Come on.

810
01:12:23,431 --> 01:12:25,431
He's learning to feed himself.

811
01:12:30,431 --> 01:12:33,331
Mr. Macdougal!

812
01:12:33,431 --> 01:12:35,331
I've eaten,
Mrs. Macdougal.

813
01:12:35,431 --> 01:12:37,431
I'll have coffee.

814
01:12:42,430 --> 01:12:44,330
Oh, here.

815
01:12:44,430 --> 01:12:46,330
Ooh, pancakes.

816
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:48,330
Good morning.

817
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:49,331
Good morning,
Mr. Macdougal.

818
01:12:49,431 --> 01:12:51,430
Come on. Let's
have some breakfast.

819
01:12:53,181 --> 01:12:54,331
Good morning.

820
01:12:54,431 --> 01:12:56,430
Look at this little boy.

821
01:12:59,181 --> 01:13:00,331
Good morning, young man.

822
01:13:00,431 --> 01:13:03,330
Good morning, Journey.
How you doing, son?

823
01:13:03,430 --> 01:13:05,330
Isn't that a face he made?

824
01:13:05,430 --> 01:13:06,331
You eating?

825
01:13:06,431 --> 01:13:08,330
Yeah.
He needs a plate.

826
01:13:08,430 --> 01:13:10,329
Woo woo woo!

827
01:13:10,429 --> 01:13:12,429
Oh, you don't have any pancakes.

828
01:13:14,429 --> 01:13:16,329
There.
Eggs?

829
01:13:16,429 --> 01:13:18,429
Yes, yes, give him eggs.

830
01:13:26,429 --> 01:13:28,329
Is your coffee cold?

831
01:13:28,429 --> 01:13:30,429
No, it's all right.

832
01:13:38,179 --> 01:13:39,329
Syrup.

833
01:13:39,429 --> 01:13:41,428
Here.

834
01:14:15,427 --> 01:14:17,427
You?

835
01:14:18,427 --> 01:14:21,427
Plump as a plum, wasn't he?

836
01:14:25,427 --> 01:14:29,327
Grandfather says pictures
show the truth sometimes.

837
01:14:29,427 --> 01:14:32,327
There's truth in this one,
I'd say.

838
01:14:32,427 --> 01:14:35,327
Look at
my smile. Ha ha.

839
01:14:35,427 --> 01:14:36,328
I'd captured her.

840
01:14:36,428 --> 01:14:40,326
And you see how
happy she is I did?

841
01:14:40,426 --> 01:14:43,326
Sometimes there's truth,
duncan's right,

842
01:14:43,426 --> 01:14:46,326
but do you see that
picture of me there?

843
01:14:46,426 --> 01:14:47,327
Don't we look like
the perfect family?

844
01:14:47,427 --> 01:14:49,326
My brother Fergus
there on the left

845
01:14:49,426 --> 01:14:51,326
was pinching the devil out of me

846
01:14:51,426 --> 01:14:52,327
when that picture was taken.

847
01:14:52,427 --> 01:14:54,326
He did that all my life.

848
01:14:54,426 --> 01:14:57,326
He still does.

849
01:14:57,426 --> 01:14:59,426
Sometimes the truth is
somewhere behind the pictures,

850
01:14:59,526 --> 01:15:00,676
not in them.

851
01:15:02,426 --> 01:15:06,326
Well, I'd better
go hose him off.

852
01:15:06,426 --> 01:15:08,325
It's early, Journey.

853
01:15:08,425 --> 01:15:09,326
Do Marcus and Lottie
know where you are?

854
01:15:09,426 --> 01:15:11,325
You want a ride?

855
01:15:11,425 --> 01:15:14,325
I'm going to ride him home
on my bike, Mr. Macdougal

856
01:15:14,425 --> 01:15:15,575
all right, then.
I'm off.

857
01:15:18,425 --> 01:15:20,325
Bye.

858
01:15:20,425 --> 01:15:21,325
Bye.

859
01:15:21,425 --> 01:15:22,575
Bye.

860
01:15:31,425 --> 01:15:33,425
Wheezer, come on!

861
01:15:34,425 --> 01:15:36,325
Come on, come on.

862
01:15:36,425 --> 01:15:39,324
Ok, wheezer, go home.

863
01:15:39,424 --> 01:15:41,324
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

864
01:15:41,424 --> 01:15:42,325
Get out of here, wheezer.

865
01:15:42,425 --> 01:15:44,324
Whoo-hoo!

866
01:15:44,424 --> 01:15:45,574
Whoo-hoo!

867
01:16:26,423 --> 01:16:28,323
Yes.

868
01:16:28,423 --> 01:16:32,423
You are a wonderful mother.

869
01:16:35,174 --> 01:16:36,324
Who taught her?

870
01:16:36,424 --> 01:16:39,322
Taught her what?
How to have kittens?

871
01:16:39,422 --> 01:16:41,322
No, how to be a mother.

872
01:16:41,422 --> 01:16:42,323
Mothers know.

873
01:16:42,423 --> 01:16:44,422
Well, not all of them.

874
01:16:48,422 --> 01:16:50,322
Grandfather.

875
01:16:50,422 --> 01:16:51,323
Hmm?

876
01:16:51,423 --> 01:16:53,322
I want to take a
picture with the timer.

877
01:16:53,422 --> 01:16:55,422
Oh, no.

878
01:16:57,172 --> 01:16:58,322
In the hall, Journey.

879
01:16:58,422 --> 01:16:59,323
Oh, no.

880
01:16:59,423 --> 01:17:01,422
Now we have two of them.

881
01:17:03,422 --> 01:17:05,322
Everybody get closer.

882
01:17:05,422 --> 01:17:08,421
All right.
Get around there.

883
01:17:09,421 --> 01:17:11,321
You sound like you-know-who.

884
01:17:11,421 --> 01:17:12,321
Who?

885
01:17:12,421 --> 01:17:13,571
The photographer twins.

886
01:17:15,421 --> 01:17:17,321
There.

887
01:17:17,421 --> 01:17:18,322
We're starting.

888
01:17:18,422 --> 01:17:20,321
10...

889
01:17:20,421 --> 01:17:21,571
9...

890
01:17:29,421 --> 01:17:31,421
Quick! Camera.

891
01:17:43,171 --> 01:17:44,321
We could keep them in my room.

892
01:17:44,421 --> 01:17:47,320
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe we could.

893
01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:48,321
It's good to eat with people

894
01:17:48,421 --> 01:17:51,320
who don't have food on
their faces. But I love Emmet.

895
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:53,320
You certainly do.

896
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:55,420
You're a good brother,
Cooper. Thank you.

897
01:17:58,171 --> 01:17:59,321
Where's she going?

898
01:17:59,421 --> 01:18:02,320
She's going out.
Don't worry.

899
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:04,320
She'll be back.

900
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:05,320
She'll come back, Journey.

901
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:06,570
She'll be back.

902
01:18:10,419 --> 01:18:13,419
Well, thanks.
I'd better get going.

903
01:18:21,419 --> 01:18:23,319
Bye. Thanks again.

904
01:18:23,419 --> 01:18:24,319
Bye, Cooper.

905
01:18:24,419 --> 01:18:25,569
Bye.

906
01:18:31,419 --> 01:18:33,419
Maybe someday I will marry him.

907
01:18:35,419 --> 01:18:38,318
Hey, come and do some gardening with me,
yeah?

908
01:18:38,418 --> 01:18:40,418
I think I'll take a
walk to the henhouse.

909
01:18:42,418 --> 01:18:44,418
Oh, I'll get it, grandfather.

910
01:18:48,418 --> 01:18:50,318
Hello.

911
01:18:50,418 --> 01:18:51,568
Journey?

912
01:18:52,418 --> 01:18:54,418
Journey, is that you?

913
01:18:57,418 --> 01:18:59,418
Journey, it's mama.

914
01:19:02,418 --> 01:19:04,418
Journey?

915
01:19:05,418 --> 01:19:07,417
Yes.

916
01:19:09,417 --> 01:19:10,567
How... how are you?

917
01:19:13,417 --> 01:19:17,317
Mama, a Cat has come...

918
01:19:17,417 --> 01:19:19,417
And the Cat's
a very good mother.

919
01:19:21,417 --> 01:19:24,317
She's staying with me...

920
01:19:24,417 --> 01:19:25,567
Forever.

921
01:20:04,167 --> 01:20:05,317
That's a new one.

922
01:20:05,417 --> 01:20:08,315
Some chicken pecked me.

923
01:20:08,415 --> 01:20:10,415
This taking pictures
is dangerous business.

924
01:20:14,166 --> 01:20:15,316
Mama called.

925
01:20:15,416 --> 01:20:18,315
She asked me how I was.

926
01:20:18,415 --> 01:20:22,415
She never said
she was sorry for leaving.

927
01:20:23,415 --> 01:20:25,315
No...

928
01:20:25,415 --> 01:20:28,415
Min doesn't want to feel guilty.

929
01:20:35,415 --> 01:20:37,314
Then mama said...

930
01:20:37,414 --> 01:20:40,414
"They were only pictures,
Journey."

931
01:20:46,414 --> 01:20:48,314
Your mama...

932
01:20:48,414 --> 01:20:52,414
Doesn't really understand
about the pictures.

933
01:20:56,414 --> 01:20:59,314
Mama wants me to visit her.

934
01:20:59,414 --> 01:21:01,314
I told her I couldn't.

935
01:21:01,414 --> 01:21:05,314
I told her I had a Cat
and kittens to take care of.

936
01:21:05,414 --> 01:21:09,313
I told her someday, maybe,

937
01:21:09,413 --> 01:21:12,313
if she sent me words
instead of money,

938
01:21:12,413 --> 01:21:13,563
I might visit her...

939
01:21:15,413 --> 01:21:16,563
Maybe.

940
01:21:19,164 --> 01:21:20,314
Grandfather?

941
01:21:20,414 --> 01:21:22,313
What, Journey?

942
01:21:22,413 --> 01:21:25,413
I told her nothing is perfect.

943
01:21:27,413 --> 01:21:29,413
Sometimes,
things are good enough.

944
01:21:35,162 --> 01:21:36,312
I like that picture.

945
01:21:36,412 --> 01:21:37,313
Hmm?

946
01:21:37,413 --> 01:21:40,312
Oh, so do I.

947
01:21:40,412 --> 01:21:42,312
Hey, is that the chicken
that pecked you?

948
01:21:42,412 --> 01:21:45,312
Ha.

949
01:21:45,412 --> 01:21:47,412
Maybe. Ha.

950
01:22:22,411 --> 01:22:23,561
Well...

951
01:22:25,411 --> 01:22:28,311
He needs things to look back on.

952
01:22:28,411 --> 01:22:31,311
Shame about the old pictures.

953
01:22:31,411 --> 01:22:33,411
Guess there's no way
to get them back.

954
01:23:15,409 --> 01:23:17,409
Where has he been?

955
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:21,310
Do you know, Journey?

956
01:23:21,410 --> 01:23:23,309
No.

957
01:23:23,409 --> 01:23:26,409
This is his third trip
to town this week.

958
01:23:29,409 --> 01:23:33,309
Do not follow me.

959
01:23:33,409 --> 01:23:35,309
Ha ha. What's he doing?

960
01:23:35,409 --> 01:23:37,408
Well, let's find out.

961
01:23:54,408 --> 01:23:57,308
Marcus...
My darling man,

962
01:23:57,408 --> 01:23:59,308
what are you doing?

963
01:23:59,408 --> 01:24:01,408
Don't sweet-talk me, Lottie!

964
01:24:08,407 --> 01:24:11,307
Well, we could spy on him.

965
01:24:11,407 --> 01:24:14,307
Better sooner than ask him.

966
01:24:14,407 --> 01:24:16,307
I think it's more fun to keep him waiting,
don't you?

967
01:24:16,407 --> 01:24:17,557
Shh.
Yeah.

968
01:24:24,407 --> 01:24:27,407
It's locked.
Knock.

969
01:24:28,158 --> 01:24:29,308
Grandfather?

970
01:24:29,408 --> 01:24:32,407
I'm busy, busy in my office.

971
01:24:35,406 --> 01:24:38,406
Well, leave him.
Come on. Come on.

972
01:25:18,405 --> 01:25:20,305
Every third or every fourth?

973
01:25:20,405 --> 01:25:21,305
Every other.

974
01:25:21,405 --> 01:25:22,555
Third.

975
01:25:25,405 --> 01:25:28,305
Remember when we used
to make tents in the backyard?

976
01:25:28,405 --> 01:25:31,305
You liked to build the tents,

977
01:25:31,405 --> 01:25:33,305
and when you were done,

978
01:25:33,405 --> 01:25:35,304
you'd sit inside all jittery,

979
01:25:35,404 --> 01:25:38,404
waiting for something more
to happen.

980
01:25:45,404 --> 01:25:47,404
What?

981
01:25:48,404 --> 01:25:50,304
Something grandfather said...

982
01:25:50,404 --> 01:25:53,304
Mama waiting
for things to happen.

983
01:25:53,404 --> 01:25:57,304
Remember when mama
got in the tent with us once?

984
01:25:57,404 --> 01:25:59,404
Yeah.

985
01:26:01,404 --> 01:26:03,304
She sat for a minute,

986
01:26:03,404 --> 01:26:07,303
and then she looked at us
and said, "well, what now?"

987
01:26:07,403 --> 01:26:10,403
You and I, we weren't enough.

988
01:26:14,403 --> 01:26:16,303
Cat...

989
01:26:16,403 --> 01:26:20,303
Sorry I couldn't put the
pictures back together.

990
01:26:20,403 --> 01:26:22,303
I tried to make
everything all right again.

991
01:26:22,403 --> 01:26:24,303
I know.

992
01:26:24,403 --> 01:26:27,303
You and grandfather...
two of a kind.

993
01:26:27,403 --> 01:26:29,303
What do you mean?

994
01:26:29,403 --> 01:26:32,303
Why do you think grandfather
takes family pictures?

995
01:26:32,403 --> 01:26:36,302
Because he likes to,
he likes the camera.

996
01:26:36,402 --> 01:26:39,302
Don't you know that grandfather
wants to give you back

997
01:26:39,402 --> 01:26:44,402
everything that mama
took away... Family.

998
01:26:47,402 --> 01:26:49,402
Cat...

999
01:26:50,402 --> 01:26:52,402
Do you... do you hate mama?

1000
01:26:55,402 --> 01:26:57,402
I hate what she did.

1001
01:26:58,402 --> 01:27:01,402
You say that,
but do you really feel that way?

1002
01:27:03,402 --> 01:27:04,552
I'm trying.

1003
01:27:10,401 --> 01:27:13,301
Do you think she cares about us?

1004
01:27:13,401 --> 01:27:16,401
In her way, I guess.

1005
01:27:28,152 --> 01:27:29,302
What? What's wrong?

1006
01:27:29,402 --> 01:27:32,301
Wish I had grandpa's
camera right now.

1007
01:27:32,401 --> 01:27:33,302
You're red.

1008
01:27:33,402 --> 01:27:35,300
Journey!

1009
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:37,300
I'm going to get you!

1010
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:39,300
I'm going to kill you!
Come back here!

1011
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:42,400
You're dead.

1012
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:46,400
Stop running!
Come here!

1013
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:53,300
You can run, but you can't hide!

1014
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:54,550
Aah!

1015
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:58,300
Can't catch me!

1016
01:27:58,400 --> 01:27:59,550
You got it all over me!

1017
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:04,550
Can't run forever.

1018
01:28:06,399 --> 01:28:07,549
I'm going to get you!

1019
01:28:09,399 --> 01:28:11,399
Stop!

1020
01:28:15,399 --> 01:28:19,299
You're a noodle, Journey!
A noodle!

1021
01:28:19,399 --> 01:28:21,299
Journey, come back here!

1022
01:28:21,399 --> 01:28:23,299
Where are you going?

1023
01:28:23,399 --> 01:28:25,399
Journey, where are you going?

1024
01:28:31,399 --> 01:28:33,299
Hello, mother.

1025
01:28:33,399 --> 01:28:36,298
Hello, Min.

1026
01:28:36,398 --> 01:28:40,298
I've not come back.

1027
01:28:40,398 --> 01:28:42,398
I didn't think you had.

1028
01:28:48,398 --> 01:28:49,548
I...

1029
01:28:51,398 --> 01:28:53,398
I can't live here.
I just can't.

1030
01:28:57,398 --> 01:28:59,398
I'm sorry.

1031
01:29:09,397 --> 01:29:11,397
I'll write you.

1032
01:29:18,397 --> 01:29:20,397
And the children?

1033
01:29:27,397 --> 01:29:29,397
They seem happy.

1034
01:29:39,396 --> 01:29:40,546
Min.

1035
01:29:42,396 --> 01:29:45,396
Min, I've learned
to play your recorder.

1036
01:29:51,396 --> 01:29:54,396
Are you all right?

1037
01:29:57,396 --> 01:29:58,546
Yeah.

1038
01:30:01,396 --> 01:30:03,296
I...

1039
01:30:03,396 --> 01:30:05,395
I have to go.

1040
01:30:51,394 --> 01:30:53,294
Good night, Journey.

1041
01:30:53,394 --> 01:30:55,294
Were you in mama's bedroom?

1042
01:30:55,394 --> 01:30:57,294
Yeah.
Kitty went in there.

1043
01:30:57,394 --> 01:30:59,294
Are you going to bed?

1044
01:30:59,394 --> 01:31:01,294
No, I'm not going to bed yet.

1045
01:31:01,394 --> 01:31:03,393
No, I've got work to do.
Good night.

1046
01:33:34,388 --> 01:33:36,288
Where are your shoes?

1047
01:33:36,388 --> 01:33:39,288
What is all this?

1048
01:33:39,388 --> 01:33:41,388
Don't talk for a minute.

1049
01:33:44,388 --> 01:33:46,288
5... 4...

1050
01:33:46,388 --> 01:33:49,288
3... 2...

1051
01:33:49,388 --> 01:33:51,388
1... yeah.

1052
01:33:59,388 --> 01:34:01,288
This is an enlarger.

1053
01:34:01,388 --> 01:34:04,387
The red light is for developing.

1054
01:34:06,138 --> 01:34:07,288
A darkroom?

1055
01:34:07,388 --> 01:34:09,287
You did all this?

1056
01:34:09,387 --> 01:34:11,287
They're black and white
pictures.

1057
01:34:11,387 --> 01:34:14,387
They're pictures from the past.

1058
01:34:22,387 --> 01:34:25,387
Now, this is a fine picture.

1059
01:34:28,387 --> 01:34:30,287
Not perfect.

1060
01:34:30,387 --> 01:34:32,286
But good enough.

1061
01:34:32,386 --> 01:34:33,536
Ha ha.

1062
01:34:36,386 --> 01:34:38,386
And there's more.

1063
01:34:44,386 --> 01:34:46,386
Mama's pictures.

1064
01:34:48,386 --> 01:34:50,286
There's a baby.

1065
01:34:50,386 --> 01:34:52,386
This one.

1066
01:35:08,385 --> 01:35:10,385
That baby...

1067
01:35:14,385 --> 01:35:16,385
Is you.

1068
01:35:39,384 --> 01:35:42,384
That's not the face I remember.

1069
01:35:47,384 --> 01:35:48,534
And now...

1070
01:35:50,135 --> 01:35:51,285
The other picture.

1071
01:35:51,385 --> 01:35:53,384
I know.

1072
01:35:55,384 --> 01:35:57,384
I already know.

1073
01:36:00,384 --> 01:36:03,283
It was your lap I sat on.

1074
01:36:03,383 --> 01:36:06,283
You sang "trot, trot to Boston,"

1075
01:36:06,383 --> 01:36:09,283
not papa.

1076
01:36:09,383 --> 01:36:10,284
It was your shirt,

1077
01:36:10,384 --> 01:36:14,283
your button I remember,

1078
01:36:14,383 --> 01:36:15,533
your face.

1079
01:36:18,383 --> 01:36:20,283
It was you who took care of me,

1080
01:36:20,383 --> 01:36:22,283
not papa.

1081
01:36:22,383 --> 01:36:24,383
It was you.

1082
01:36:42,382 --> 01:36:43,532
And this is when you knew.

1083
01:37:05,381 --> 01:37:07,281
Teenaged Journey, narrating:
<i>That summer night,</i>

1084
01:37:07,381 --> 01:37:10,281
<i>grandfather and I walked
out through the barn.</i>

1085
01:37:10,381 --> 01:37:13,281
<i>I trailed my fingers
along the wood walls.</i>

1086
01:37:13,381 --> 01:37:15,281
<i>I touched the hay,</i>

1087
01:37:15,381 --> 01:37:18,381
<i>as if touching it
somehow made it mine.</i>

1088
01:37:30,381 --> 01:37:32,380
<i>Once they loved me.</i>

1089
01:37:35,380 --> 01:37:37,280
<i>Teenaged when we opened the door</i>

1090
01:37:37,380 --> 01:37:40,280
<i>and walked out of the barn,</i>

1091
01:37:40,380 --> 01:37:42,280
<i>the night had gone,</i>

1092
01:37:42,380 --> 01:37:49,380
<i>and the sun had come up.</i>
