1
00:01:01,348 --> 00:01:02,679
Stay down.

2
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,717
- Where do you think he is, Jesse?
- Could be anywhere.

3
00:01:07,954 --> 00:01:09,182
Come on.

4
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:13,951
Let's go, come on.

5
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:24,628
Go!

6
00:01:31,878 --> 00:01:34,438
- What is it?
- Thought I heard Morgan.

7
00:01:34,514 --> 00:01:35,845
Behind us.

8
00:01:40,554 --> 00:01:43,352
- What are we doing?
- We're waiting, Steve.

9
00:01:50,163 --> 00:01:52,063
- Here he comes.
- There's Morgan.

10
00:01:52,132 --> 00:01:54,862
He'll come rushing in like always.

11
00:01:54,935 --> 00:01:56,425
We'll get him.

12
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,428
Now!

13
00:02:01,274 --> 00:02:03,299
You'll walk the plank, Bluebeard!

14
00:02:03,376 --> 00:02:05,310
You're going to be food for sharks.

15
00:02:05,378 --> 00:02:07,141
You'll never take me alive.

16
00:02:11,618 --> 00:02:12,778
Gotcha!

17
00:02:12,853 --> 00:02:14,218
You got me.

18
00:02:14,321 --> 00:02:18,758
I can see it.
My whole life flashing before my eyes.

19
00:02:29,169 --> 00:02:31,296
You know, Morgan, you always die good.

20
00:02:32,572 --> 00:02:36,099
- What are you doing?
- We're going to bury some treasure.

21
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:40,046
- Here's our treasure chest.
- Great! Now all we need is the treasure.

22
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,738
I got treasure...

23
00:02:42,082 --> 00:02:43,549
...my lucky clearie.

24
00:02:45,418 --> 00:02:49,218
- My Apache arrowhead.
- My penny that was run over by a train.

25
00:02:56,463 --> 00:02:59,057
Careful, Jesse. That knife is sharp.

26
00:03:01,768 --> 00:03:03,395
Your turn, Steve.

27
00:03:10,577 --> 00:03:12,169
Repeat after me...

28
00:03:12,345 --> 00:03:14,813
Some day we'll come back
and dig up the treasure.

29
00:03:14,881 --> 00:03:17,441
"Some day we'll come back
and dig up the treasure."

30
00:03:17,517 --> 00:03:20,918
- And we'll never split up.
- "And we'll never split up."

31
00:03:20,987 --> 00:03:22,784
"We'll never split up."

32
00:04:00,794 --> 00:04:02,159
Hey, Jesse.

33
00:04:05,465 --> 00:04:07,194
- Hey, Bridget.
- Jesse!

34
00:04:11,538 --> 00:04:13,267
You look like shit.

35
00:04:14,374 --> 00:04:15,568
Thanks.

36
00:04:17,243 --> 00:04:22,044
Listen, can you hook me up, darling?
I'm a little on edge.

37
00:04:23,283 --> 00:04:26,343
I can't do that for you. I'll get you a beer.

38
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,883
Carl, can I have a beer?

39
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,044
Yeah, sure.

40
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,085
Is there anything around?

41
00:04:33,626 --> 00:04:35,753
Mouse or Elliot?

42
00:04:36,262 --> 00:04:37,286
No.

43
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,862
I don't like to see you look like this.

44
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:46,903
You can move back in with me, you know.
Any time.

45
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,871
I'd like that.

46
00:04:51,778 --> 00:04:53,302
I wish I could.

47
00:04:56,082 --> 00:04:57,845
Thanks for the beer.

48
00:05:01,621 --> 00:05:03,816
You're wasting your time on that one.

49
00:05:04,124 --> 00:05:05,853
He's just a junkie.

50
00:05:09,896 --> 00:05:12,364
I can't go to Mouse, I'm flat broke.

51
00:05:12,465 --> 00:05:14,558
Can't you just hook me up? I'm hurting.

52
00:05:14,634 --> 00:05:17,694
- I can't help you, man.
- I need something, bad. Come on.

53
00:05:17,771 --> 00:05:18,863
Shit.

54
00:05:19,572 --> 00:05:22,405
- Step off, man.
- Know it blows, bro.

55
00:06:08,755 --> 00:06:11,349
You're $1 short and a day late, baby.

56
00:06:11,858 --> 00:06:13,189
They gone.

57
00:06:13,293 --> 00:06:15,022
They all long gone.

58
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:20,429
But you know what?
They had that good shit, too.

59
00:06:22,268 --> 00:06:23,360
Right!

60
00:06:54,033 --> 00:06:56,661
What are you trying to fuckin' sell me?

61
00:06:56,736 --> 00:06:58,897
There ain't no fuckin' crank in this.

62
00:07:02,075 --> 00:07:03,736
Hey, motherfucker.

63
00:07:04,944 --> 00:07:06,605
Thought you said you liked dope.

64
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,128
Boo.

65
00:08:58,091 --> 00:08:59,922
What the fuck are you doing?

66
00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:08,965
Shit! What's happening, Jesse?

67
00:09:27,353 --> 00:09:28,513
Jesse!

68
00:09:34,927 --> 00:09:36,053
Jesse.

69
00:09:46,673 --> 00:09:49,335
- Mouse here.
- Hello, Mouse. It's Jesse.

70
00:09:49,409 --> 00:09:51,900
- Fuckin' Jesse...
- No, don't hang up!

71
00:09:52,045 --> 00:09:55,572
- Do you have my money?
- Yeah, I do. I got some money.

72
00:09:55,648 --> 00:09:59,414
I swear to God, man. You hear that?
That is cash.

73
00:10:00,753 --> 00:10:05,349
- Great. I'll see you in the morning.
- Not in the morning. I need some now.

74
00:10:05,525 --> 00:10:08,551
- It's too late now.
- I'll give you all that I owe you and more.

75
00:10:08,628 --> 00:10:11,256
Come on, please. Let me come over right now.

76
00:10:11,331 --> 00:10:13,390
All right, you shit. We'll do it now.

77
00:10:14,267 --> 00:10:16,497
Thank you very much. Thanks.

78
00:10:52,138 --> 00:10:53,162
Fuck.

79
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:14,084
- I'm going to split.
- Okay, man. I'll see you later.

80
00:11:14,494 --> 00:11:18,624
No, I mean, I'm going to split.

81
00:11:20,566 --> 00:11:24,058
Go stay with Bridget maybe or somewhere.

82
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:27,469
What about my money, man?
You still haven't paid me shit.

83
00:11:29,842 --> 00:11:32,743
Let's see... Uno, dos...

84
00:11:34,547 --> 00:11:37,141
...tres hundred dollars. Is that cool?

85
00:11:37,316 --> 00:11:39,284
Yeah, man. That's cool.

86
00:11:40,686 --> 00:11:41,914
Want some spaghetti?

87
00:11:46,225 --> 00:11:47,817
I think I'll pass.

88
00:11:50,263 --> 00:11:52,356
The drumming sounds good, man.

89
00:12:12,885 --> 00:12:15,581
Have you seen Bridget? She been here today?

90
00:12:16,022 --> 00:12:18,456
She left about 30 minutes ago.

91
00:12:19,358 --> 00:12:23,260
- Did she say where she was going?
- No, just that she was hungry.

92
00:12:23,329 --> 00:12:25,524
Tell her good-bye. I've got to split.

93
00:12:25,598 --> 00:12:28,123
- How about paying your bill?
- Yeah.

94
00:12:43,483 --> 00:12:44,950
Motherfucker!

95
00:12:46,986 --> 00:12:48,317
Come here!

96
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,182
Shit!

97
00:13:08,441 --> 00:13:13,378
Flight 421 to Houston, now boarding at 37 D.

98
00:13:15,081 --> 00:13:21,452
Your attention, please. Flight 421
to Houston, now boarding at gate 37 D.

99
00:13:54,654 --> 00:13:57,145
- How much to go to Galveston?
- Galveston?

100
00:13:59,926 --> 00:14:01,325
Yeah, right!

101
00:14:01,861 --> 00:14:04,421
Galveston's 50 miles from here, boy.

102
00:14:06,699 --> 00:14:08,667
Can you take me or what?

103
00:14:09,635 --> 00:14:12,433
You got the money, honey, I got the time.

104
00:15:03,723 --> 00:15:08,126
Morgan, here. Leave a message
after the beep. I'll return it if I feel like it.

105
00:15:15,001 --> 00:15:17,561
- How long will you need the boat?
- About a month...

106
00:15:17,637 --> 00:15:19,571
...to go back and forth to the island.

107
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:23,871
All right. Why don't you just buy it
with that wad of money you got?

108
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:27,104
What would I want to buy this piece ofjunk for?

109
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:36,750
I'm driving a boat in Texas now!

110
00:15:55,808 --> 00:15:57,207
Hey, Morgan.

111
00:16:00,413 --> 00:16:01,971
Fuck me a-running.

112
00:16:05,184 --> 00:16:06,412
God damn!

113
00:16:07,953 --> 00:16:09,045
Shit.

114
00:16:11,457 --> 00:16:15,689
You're lucky you came to see the doctor
because I'm going to fix you right up.

115
00:16:15,761 --> 00:16:17,854
I got your medicine, buddy.

116
00:16:25,137 --> 00:16:28,903
A little cool pop on the rocks.
Nothing like it to settle your stomach.

117
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,472
- Thanks.
- Salud.

118
00:16:33,512 --> 00:16:34,604
Damn.

119
00:16:36,048 --> 00:16:37,913
Fixing to fight a war?

120
00:16:38,751 --> 00:16:40,150
If I ever have to.

121
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,552
Yours?

122
00:16:46,225 --> 00:16:48,352
No. Some chick named Shelley.

123
00:16:48,561 --> 00:16:51,052
You know they always like to leave something.

124
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:53,530
Gives them a reason to come back.

125
00:16:54,967 --> 00:16:56,832
You're not dead.

126
00:16:57,903 --> 00:17:00,667
Me and Steve, we thought
you had to be dead or something.

127
00:17:00,906 --> 00:17:02,498
You didn't call.

128
00:17:03,042 --> 00:17:04,669
You didn't write.

129
00:17:07,947 --> 00:17:08,936
Hey, dude.

130
00:17:10,116 --> 00:17:11,708
You look like shit.

131
00:17:12,017 --> 00:17:15,453
I'm okay. I'm just a little beat.

132
00:17:30,536 --> 00:17:32,367
The curtain just moved again.

133
00:17:37,743 --> 00:17:40,337
Man, Steve is going to shit his drawers.

134
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:44,672
I called him this morning,
but some woman answered, so I hung up.

135
00:17:45,251 --> 00:17:47,651
That's no woman, that's his wife.

136
00:17:48,621 --> 00:17:50,088
He's married?

137
00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:54,350
Steve's been married so long,
he's wearing fuckin' golfing shirts.

138
00:17:55,027 --> 00:17:59,157
She's something else, I'll tell you that.
Her Daddy's an oil man, loaded to the tits.

139
00:17:59,698 --> 00:18:03,464
- Steve's a big old corporate fuck now.
- Figures.

140
00:18:03,536 --> 00:18:06,198
What about you?
You still playing that guit-fiddle?

141
00:18:06,272 --> 00:18:08,706
You rich and famous out there yet?

142
00:18:09,074 --> 00:18:11,372
Yeah, I'm rich and famous.

143
00:18:16,515 --> 00:18:17,812
What about yourself?

144
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,608
I'm working them off-shore oil rigs.

145
00:18:21,921 --> 00:18:23,786
You must be hauling in good money.

146
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:27,254
I make enough to keep me
in beer and poontang.

147
00:18:37,036 --> 00:18:39,163
Hold on. Here he comes.

148
00:18:50,716 --> 00:18:52,183
Hey, Skipper!

149
00:19:02,528 --> 00:19:05,554
That's a snappy-looking sports coat
you got on there, Skipper.

150
00:19:05,631 --> 00:19:06,928
How you doing, Marshall?

151
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:08,700
Hey, Skipper.

152
00:19:09,969 --> 00:19:13,962
Seems like to me you'd have been
back up in Humboldt by now.

153
00:19:15,741 --> 00:19:18,676
I was going to call you today.
I got a problem down here.

154
00:19:18,744 --> 00:19:21,338
I'm working on it now.
Just about got it fixed back.

155
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,738
Fixed back?

156
00:19:22,815 --> 00:19:26,080
Yeah, it's a long, fucked-up story.
I'm lucky I'm even here.

157
00:19:26,318 --> 00:19:27,683
Where's the money?

158
00:19:27,953 --> 00:19:29,147
That's the problem.

159
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:34,059
Sort of. I know where it is.
I know who's got it, anyway.

160
00:19:35,227 --> 00:19:37,092
You remember Chuck T?

161
00:19:39,231 --> 00:19:42,257
Chuck T. From Humboldt? Yeah.

162
00:19:42,801 --> 00:19:45,429
He's letting us use his house
out there in Topanga.

163
00:19:45,504 --> 00:19:47,165
Why don't you come with us?

164
00:19:47,239 --> 00:19:50,402
You can tell us your story
about how everything got screwed up.

165
00:19:51,076 --> 00:19:52,941
He's got a pool table.

166
00:19:53,412 --> 00:19:57,280
- What do you say?
- Okay. That'd be good.

167
00:19:59,685 --> 00:20:01,653
Are you mad at me?

168
00:20:02,087 --> 00:20:06,888
Look at that. His wife's name is on
his damn boat. Pussy-whipped or what?

169
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:08,517
Ship ahoy, asshole.

170
00:20:08,627 --> 00:20:10,288
What do you say, Morgan?

171
00:20:13,198 --> 00:20:15,894
I hear you're a Republican now, Steven.

172
00:20:19,939 --> 00:20:20,928
Jesse?

173
00:20:21,607 --> 00:20:23,905
- I'm afraid so.
- Where you been?

174
00:20:24,243 --> 00:20:26,370
He's a world traveler, been everywhere.

175
00:20:26,445 --> 00:20:28,538
Now he's back. You believe it?

176
00:20:29,014 --> 00:20:31,812
Why didn't you let us know where you were?

177
00:20:33,018 --> 00:20:35,145
I don't know, I should have.

178
00:20:36,388 --> 00:20:40,449
Why didn't you let your granddad know?
He went to the police. They didn't know.

179
00:20:40,526 --> 00:20:43,393
Everybody thought something
must have happened to you.

180
00:20:44,063 --> 00:20:48,056
- I'm sorry.
- Seven fuckin' years and not a word!

181
00:20:48,133 --> 00:20:50,624
Know what you put us through?
You couldn't call?

182
00:20:50,703 --> 00:20:54,139
- You couldn't write us a postcard?
- Damn it, Steve, back off.

183
00:20:54,306 --> 00:20:57,571
I came back to see y'all.
You don't have to start giving me shit.

184
00:20:57,977 --> 00:20:59,808
- Damn.
- Come on.

185
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,608
Come on.

186
00:21:03,048 --> 00:21:04,276
Hold on.

187
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,082
It's great to see you.

188
00:21:21,767 --> 00:21:23,564
Get off the goddamn rag.

189
00:21:23,736 --> 00:21:25,431
- Daddy!
- No.

190
00:21:26,238 --> 00:21:27,262
You're kidding.

191
00:21:29,174 --> 00:21:32,632
Jeremy, come over here
and say hey to your Uncle Jesse.

192
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:35,068
Hey, kid.

193
00:21:35,914 --> 00:21:37,211
Hi, Uncle Jesse.

194
00:22:03,342 --> 00:22:05,936
- Good shot.
- Wasn't that fuckin' hard.

195
00:22:13,952 --> 00:22:16,079
- Where do they live?
- I'm serious.

196
00:22:16,155 --> 00:22:18,350
Shut the fuck up, this is their neighborhood.

197
00:22:18,424 --> 00:22:20,051
Steve lives here?

198
00:22:20,225 --> 00:22:22,489
He's big shit. He's corporate and all.

199
00:22:22,661 --> 00:22:24,526
This is big, clean...

200
00:22:24,963 --> 00:22:26,453
Little Stevie!

201
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:30,631
Hey there, Michelle. How you doing, darling?

202
00:22:30,702 --> 00:22:31,828
Hi, Morgan.

203
00:22:31,937 --> 00:22:34,735
I want you to say hey to Jesse, the Jesse.

204
00:22:35,174 --> 00:22:38,473
Steve told me you were back for a visit.
Nice to finally meet you.

205
00:22:38,544 --> 00:22:40,739
- Nice to meet you.
- See there.

206
00:22:42,247 --> 00:22:47,082
We're on our way to the Point.
Thought you both might want to come.

207
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:49,947
We'd love to, but my parents are here.

208
00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:52,120
Hi, there.

209
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:55,654
Steve, come on now! Let's go get drunk.

210
00:22:56,028 --> 00:22:57,586
Get some clean underwear on.

211
00:22:58,297 --> 00:23:00,765
So you say this cat's name is Jesse?

212
00:23:03,969 --> 00:23:06,164
And you been looking for him.

213
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,734
I've been looking for him.

214
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:12,203
I tore up half of goddamn Hollywood
looking for him.

215
00:23:12,277 --> 00:23:14,871
I almost caught the son of a bitch
in a crosswalk.

216
00:23:14,947 --> 00:23:16,471
In a crosswalk?

217
00:23:17,549 --> 00:23:19,414
But he got away again?

218
00:23:21,787 --> 00:23:24,221
I couldn't get out of the fuckin' car.

219
00:23:29,728 --> 00:23:32,663
You didn't take that money yourself, did you?

220
00:23:33,065 --> 00:23:34,157
What?

221
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,961
Hell no, Marshall!

222
00:23:37,503 --> 00:23:41,030
God damn it! I didn't want to come down
here in the first place.

223
00:23:41,106 --> 00:23:43,734
Skipper, son, this is a major fuck-up.

224
00:23:44,543 --> 00:23:47,068
You lost track of a lot of my money.

225
00:23:47,212 --> 00:23:49,874
I know I did. I'm sorry, I just fucked this up.

226
00:23:50,482 --> 00:23:53,007
This is business, did you know that?

227
00:23:55,454 --> 00:23:57,445
Are you pissed off at me?

228
00:23:57,789 --> 00:24:00,781
- Did you tell me the whole story?
- Yeah.

229
00:24:01,527 --> 00:24:05,588
I gave you all the damn details. I know
I'm good with details, you've said that.

230
00:24:05,831 --> 00:24:10,393
Take your finger out of your ass
and send this prick to get our money, or...

231
00:24:11,603 --> 00:24:13,901
Duff, I believe I'd keep my mouth shut.

232
00:24:21,013 --> 00:24:25,143
I got half a mind to send your ass
back to Humboldt County, but I won't.

233
00:24:25,217 --> 00:24:27,879
I appreciate that. Thank you.

234
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,813
I'm sorry I fucked this up.

235
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:35,290
But I'm going to do the best I can
to help straighten it out, I mean it.

236
00:24:37,296 --> 00:24:39,093
I'll set it straight.

237
00:24:39,865 --> 00:24:41,992
You told me the whole story?

238
00:24:42,367 --> 00:24:43,356
Yeah.

239
00:24:43,535 --> 00:24:47,335
- Didn't leave anything out?
- No, I didn't leave nothing out...

240
00:25:01,887 --> 00:25:04,685
Get this sack of shit out of here,
then clean this up.

241
00:25:04,756 --> 00:25:06,621
This is not our house.

242
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,185
How are we going to get the money?

243
00:25:12,731 --> 00:25:14,221
We find Jesse.

244
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,536
Will somebody light a joint?
I got a fuckin' headache.

245
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:41,158
I've been up in Alaska
working on them crab boats.

246
00:25:41,226 --> 00:25:43,091
Made a bunch of money.

247
00:25:43,161 --> 00:25:46,187
So I went to Vegas
where I lost it all playing roulette...

248
00:25:46,398 --> 00:25:50,198
...but not to worry, I won it all back
and then some playing blackjack...

249
00:25:50,269 --> 00:25:53,966
...so I thought I'd spread it around,
come back here and spend it on my boys.

250
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:56,269
- Hell, get it out, man.
- That's great.

251
00:26:00,178 --> 00:26:04,638
Hey, fellas. Those three little chicky birds
are looking at us.

252
00:26:05,317 --> 00:26:06,545
Don't you start...

253
00:26:09,354 --> 00:26:11,083
Excuse me, Lou-Ann.

254
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:15,551
We would like to buy those three,
hot, little chicky birds some alcohol.

255
00:26:15,627 --> 00:26:18,960
- And another round for this table here.
- No, you better count me out.

256
00:26:19,031 --> 00:26:21,158
- Come on!
- I promised Michelle I'd get back...

257
00:26:21,233 --> 00:26:22,393
Relax!

258
00:26:23,935 --> 00:26:25,459
We'll get you back.

259
00:26:26,004 --> 00:26:28,700
We don't want you getting conked
with no rolling pin.

260
00:26:28,774 --> 00:26:31,800
It's just that her parents go to bed
real early and...

261
00:26:31,877 --> 00:26:33,344
That's sweet.

262
00:26:34,379 --> 00:26:38,782
Couldn't do it. You know, my balls, Jesse,
they sensitive to squeezing.

263
00:26:41,219 --> 00:26:43,585
- Morgan was married. Did he tell you this?
- No.

264
00:26:43,855 --> 00:26:46,119
- Did he tell you he was married?
- This Morgan?

265
00:26:46,191 --> 00:26:48,421
- This Morgan. Did he tell you?
- He was married?

266
00:26:48,727 --> 00:26:52,356
He didn't tell you about this?
Tell him, how was that marriage?

267
00:26:52,497 --> 00:26:55,295
- Fuck you.
- I'm just curious. How was that?

268
00:26:58,103 --> 00:27:01,038
The longest six weeks of my life.
I'll tell you that.

269
00:27:01,106 --> 00:27:03,074
You were married for six whole weeks?

270
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:05,176
That's a long time for you.

271
00:27:05,243 --> 00:27:07,711
Then, the dumb fuck went
and joined the Marines.

272
00:27:08,146 --> 00:27:09,545
The Marines?

273
00:27:10,916 --> 00:27:14,215
I was in the Marines, and watch it
with that "dumb fuck" shit, Steve.

274
00:27:14,353 --> 00:27:16,321
- I'm proud to be a Marine.
- Yes, sir.

275
00:27:16,388 --> 00:27:19,721
- Dumb fuck to you, son.
- This guy wanted to go the damn Gulf War.

276
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:22,552
- Get out. You were in the Gulf?
- Yeah.

277
00:27:23,495 --> 00:27:24,860
What was that like?

278
00:27:24,996 --> 00:27:29,490
Hell, man. There were 17,000 of us
on ships off the Kuwait coast.

279
00:27:30,302 --> 00:27:31,963
I was on a Nassau.

280
00:27:33,739 --> 00:27:36,640
I was primed. I was ready to hit the beach.

281
00:27:37,109 --> 00:27:40,340
I couldn't sleep at night thinking about it.
Me and my buddies...

282
00:27:40,412 --> 00:27:44,906
...storming through the surf, up that sand,
going to kick Abdul's ass, right?

283
00:27:45,717 --> 00:27:47,184
So we waited.

284
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:49,250
We waited.

285
00:27:49,821 --> 00:27:51,311
And we waited.

286
00:27:54,126 --> 00:27:56,788
- And?
- They never sent us in.

287
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,598
We were just a fuckin' decoy.

288
00:28:00,665 --> 00:28:04,101
That's all we were.
The whole show went on without us.

289
00:28:04,569 --> 00:28:07,094
The biggest goddamn disappointment of my life.

290
00:28:07,239 --> 00:28:11,733
The closest I came to combat
was an incoming from a fuckin' seagull.

291
00:28:13,178 --> 00:28:15,772
He's pissed he didn't get a chance
to shoot anyone.

292
00:28:15,847 --> 00:28:19,476
No, I ain't. Don't make fun
of shit you don't understand, son.

293
00:28:19,551 --> 00:28:22,145
Greatest honor a man can have
is to die for his country.

294
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,415
- Don't you understand?
- I don't know.

295
00:28:24,489 --> 00:28:26,980
Thank you. I don't think I agree.

296
00:28:27,192 --> 00:28:30,628
I don't think I'd be willing to die
for anything any politician...

297
00:28:30,695 --> 00:28:32,822
...or government told me to.

298
00:28:32,898 --> 00:28:34,092
Not me.

299
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:37,829
There are some things
I might be willing to die for.

300
00:28:38,036 --> 00:28:39,367
Like what?

301
00:28:40,272 --> 00:28:41,739
Like what?

302
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,471
Like what would you be willing to die for?
I'm a little curious.

303
00:28:45,877 --> 00:28:48,175
- My family.
- Your family?

304
00:28:48,413 --> 00:28:51,211
What about your friends?
What about me and him?

305
00:28:51,283 --> 00:28:53,080
What about me or him?

306
00:28:54,186 --> 00:28:57,155
You, maybe. You're an asshole.

307
00:28:57,989 --> 00:28:59,388
- Salud.
- Salud.

308
00:29:00,091 --> 00:29:02,855
Jesus Christ! The fuckin' friends I have.

309
00:29:30,455 --> 00:29:32,218
I ate it all, Mommy.

310
00:29:34,226 --> 00:29:36,421
- Good.
- Can I go out and play?

311
00:29:36,695 --> 00:29:38,094
Sure, honey.

312
00:29:59,251 --> 00:30:02,948
This guy's fat. Skipper said Jesse was skinny.

313
00:30:03,021 --> 00:30:07,082
This guy's long gone. He's probably
spending our money in Hawaii.

314
00:30:09,194 --> 00:30:10,718
We'll find him.

315
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,561
Here's your peppers, honey.

316
00:30:13,632 --> 00:30:17,625
I'll give you some onions.
Sauté them in some butter, slowly.

317
00:30:27,012 --> 00:30:28,502
Jesse Parish.

318
00:31:26,404 --> 00:31:28,235
How are you, Granddad?

319
00:31:29,674 --> 00:31:31,164
Tolerable.

320
00:31:33,511 --> 00:31:34,910
That's good.

321
00:31:36,948 --> 00:31:38,711
What are you making?

322
00:31:38,783 --> 00:31:41,308
Don't rightly know till I finish it.

323
00:31:53,932 --> 00:31:56,230
What happened to the bait shop?

324
00:31:56,668 --> 00:31:58,067
Blowed down.

325
00:31:59,504 --> 00:32:01,870
How come you didn't build it back?

326
00:32:18,523 --> 00:32:20,616
You're pretty good at this.

327
00:32:23,061 --> 00:32:24,995
How come you didn't come back here?

328
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:28,628
Ain't heard hide nor hair of you for years.

329
00:32:29,467 --> 00:32:31,799
Ain't got no money to speak of.

330
00:32:34,239 --> 00:32:37,766
To tell you the truth,
I wasn't going to ask for any money.

331
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:40,810
I was going to give you some.

332
00:32:43,348 --> 00:32:46,977
You can use it for the bait shop
or whatever you want.

333
00:32:50,221 --> 00:32:54,317
Where'd you get that?
Don't tell me. I don't want to know.

334
00:32:54,392 --> 00:32:57,020
And I don't want none of that, neither.

335
00:32:57,362 --> 00:33:00,456
I guess I shouldn't be surprised
at your irresponsible ways, boy.

336
00:33:00,532 --> 00:33:02,193
Just like your mama was.

337
00:33:02,701 --> 00:33:06,762
One of these days I expect
she'll come waltzing back in here, too.

338
00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:09,106
I doubt that.

339
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:12,771
You ain't staying here with me, are you?

340
00:33:14,112 --> 00:33:16,012
No, I'm staying at Morgan's.

341
00:33:16,247 --> 00:33:19,580
I was going to say you could stay
in the tool shed in the back.

342
00:33:19,751 --> 00:33:24,518
I got kind of used to staying by myself.
Ain't nothing against you in particular.

343
00:33:26,357 --> 00:33:27,688
Thank you.

344
00:33:34,032 --> 00:33:37,433
When was the last time
that you called me by my name?

345
00:34:39,664 --> 00:34:42,326
His name's Jesse. Long-haired rocker type.

346
00:34:42,467 --> 00:34:45,300
He was supposed to hang out here all the time.

347
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:48,937
Hey, white boy.
What the hell them damn tattoos mean?

348
00:34:49,607 --> 00:34:53,236
I know y'all not white supremacists,
some kind of Nazis.

349
00:34:53,878 --> 00:34:55,345
Yeah, we are.

350
00:34:56,681 --> 00:34:59,377
The tattoos mean we don't like niggers.

351
00:34:59,884 --> 00:35:01,249
Know where this guy is?

352
00:35:01,319 --> 00:35:04,049
No, man. We don't know no goddamn Jesse!

353
00:35:05,123 --> 00:35:08,422
Y'all don't want Calvin
to cut your guts out, do ya?

354
00:35:11,563 --> 00:35:15,021
There's a guy named Mouse.
He sells a lot of shit to the rockers.

355
00:35:15,133 --> 00:35:16,862
Why don't you ask him?

356
00:35:16,935 --> 00:35:20,063
If your boy's smoked out or a junkie,
Mouse'll know him.

357
00:35:20,572 --> 00:35:21,732
Mouse.

358
00:35:35,553 --> 00:35:37,077
Yee-haw! This is great!

359
00:35:37,222 --> 00:35:38,450
Yee-haw.

360
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:41,087
Now I remember why I left Texas.

361
00:35:46,764 --> 00:35:49,358
- What a dumb-ass, man.
- I hate to see that happen.

362
00:35:49,434 --> 00:35:52,267
Would you ride one of them bulls for $1,000?

363
00:35:52,604 --> 00:35:53,628
No.

364
00:35:55,139 --> 00:35:56,231
Look.

365
00:35:58,576 --> 00:36:00,703
Jesse, you feeling all right?

366
00:36:02,847 --> 00:36:04,747
I got to go to the can.

367
00:36:09,754 --> 00:36:12,723
Whoa there, fella. Don't you say "excuse me"?

368
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:15,156
Fuck off, I've got to go to the bathroom.

369
00:36:15,293 --> 00:36:19,696
- Don't they teach you freaks any manners?
- Get the fuck off of me, you redneck!

370
00:36:24,102 --> 00:36:25,592
Fuckin' pussy.

371
00:36:26,137 --> 00:36:30,403
I'm going to rip this goddamn door off,
and whoop your scrawny little ass.

372
00:37:06,911 --> 00:37:09,072
Son of a bitch probably picked my wallet.

373
00:37:09,213 --> 00:37:11,306
He's probably on dope, too.

374
00:37:12,817 --> 00:37:16,184
Sir, I'm a police officer.
Could you open up, please?

375
00:37:20,758 --> 00:37:23,283
Hold on, I'm taking a crap.

376
00:37:30,435 --> 00:37:32,801
God damn it, open up, you little thief!

377
00:37:33,871 --> 00:37:35,736
Would you come out, please?

378
00:37:36,107 --> 00:37:39,235
Just a minute. I'll just get my pants up.

379
00:37:43,748 --> 00:37:45,773
What the hell's going on here?

380
00:37:46,017 --> 00:37:48,611
He said you tried to take his wallet.

381
00:37:49,954 --> 00:37:53,253
He's crazy.
Look how he's dressed, for God's sake.

382
00:37:53,591 --> 00:37:55,582
Hell, look at that shirt.

383
00:37:57,428 --> 00:37:59,555
What are you high on, buddy?

384
00:38:01,232 --> 00:38:03,723
Unfortunately, I am not high on anything.

385
00:38:03,835 --> 00:38:06,668
If you'll excuse me,
I've got some friends waiting for me.

386
00:38:06,771 --> 00:38:08,102
Excuse me.

387
00:38:08,306 --> 00:38:10,501
The boy put this in my stall.

388
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,878
- What's your name?
- I'm not going to tell you.

389
00:38:17,949 --> 00:38:19,109
What's your name?

390
00:38:19,183 --> 00:38:21,651
You're so pretty. Where'd you go to school?

391
00:38:21,819 --> 00:38:24,447
Where you from? What's your name?

392
00:38:26,524 --> 00:38:27,616
Fuck.

393
00:38:31,729 --> 00:38:32,753
Elizabeth.

394
00:38:44,208 --> 00:38:45,903
What the fuck is going on?

395
00:38:45,977 --> 00:38:47,467
Where'd he go?

396
00:38:53,351 --> 00:38:55,148
Didn't he go the other way?

397
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,784
No, he was headed for the back gate.

398
00:38:58,056 --> 00:38:59,080
There he is.

399
00:39:02,427 --> 00:39:04,292
Get in here. It's us.

400
00:39:08,232 --> 00:39:11,963
- Let's go. Come on.
- Let's get the hell out of here.

401
00:39:13,404 --> 00:39:16,032
- What's wrong?
- Let's take him to the hospital.

402
00:39:16,207 --> 00:39:19,108
No hospitals. Just get me back to Galveston.

403
00:39:21,813 --> 00:39:24,077
- What are you doing?
- Tell me what's going on.

404
00:39:24,148 --> 00:39:25,911
Did you steal something? Are you sick?

405
00:39:25,983 --> 00:39:29,248
Fuck, he's not sick. Look, he's a fuckin' junkie.

406
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,753
Fuck you!

407
00:39:32,123 --> 00:39:33,215
Shit.

408
00:39:45,937 --> 00:39:48,838
- What happened to you out there?
- You don't know shit!

409
00:39:48,906 --> 00:39:52,899
Just get me the hell home.
Not to Granddad's to Morgan's where my...

410
00:39:52,977 --> 00:39:55,241
- You should've told us.
- Where my thing is!

411
00:39:55,646 --> 00:39:59,082
- Lf you had come back, we could've helped.
- I am back!

412
00:40:01,586 --> 00:40:02,848
I'm here.

413
00:40:10,261 --> 00:40:12,456
How you doing tonight, Mouse?

414
00:40:16,234 --> 00:40:18,202
What's the fuckin' deal?

415
00:40:20,838 --> 00:40:25,172
We just want a little information
and then we'll get out of here.

416
00:40:25,343 --> 00:40:27,641
I'll give you a little information.

417
00:40:27,712 --> 00:40:31,273
I don't like dickheads who invite
themselves into my fuckin' house.

418
00:40:32,517 --> 00:40:34,178
Actually, Mouse...

419
00:40:34,819 --> 00:40:36,810
...Esmerelda here, she invited us in.

420
00:40:36,954 --> 00:40:38,478
They're real nice, Mouse.

421
00:40:38,556 --> 00:40:40,114
You shut the fuck up!

422
00:40:41,492 --> 00:40:43,756
- Sit down.
- Don't tell me what to fuckin' do...

423
00:40:43,828 --> 00:40:46,126
God damn you, sit the fuck down!

424
00:40:47,565 --> 00:40:48,930
God damn it!

425
00:40:56,941 --> 00:40:59,273
You sure know how to piss a guy off, don't you?

426
00:40:59,343 --> 00:41:01,208
I've got one simple question for you.

427
00:41:01,846 --> 00:41:03,336
Where's Jesse?

428
00:41:04,215 --> 00:41:06,979
Jesse? That fuckin' skank head.

429
00:41:08,786 --> 00:41:10,378
He lives on Franklin.

430
00:41:10,454 --> 00:41:12,388
Franklin's a long street.

431
00:41:12,456 --> 00:41:15,391
East of Highland,
in those little fuckin' shitty buildings.

432
00:41:15,459 --> 00:41:17,518
He lives with a guy named Gary.

433
00:41:17,595 --> 00:41:20,223
He's a fat fuckin' drummer, all right?

434
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,858
See how easy that was?

435
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,320
Someone's at your door.

436
00:41:44,655 --> 00:41:47,146
Could you get it, you fuckin' slug?

437
00:41:49,026 --> 00:41:51,517
I'm coming. Keep your britches on.

438
00:41:53,731 --> 00:41:56,256
- Hey, Michelle.
- Why are you doing this to my husband?

439
00:41:56,334 --> 00:41:58,734
- Excuse me?
- I know all about you.

440
00:41:59,136 --> 00:42:00,262
Do you?

441
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:03,197
You're a heroin addict.

442
00:42:05,076 --> 00:42:06,634
But I'm going to stop.

443
00:42:06,911 --> 00:42:10,369
You expect Steve to drop everything
and take a week off from work...

444
00:42:10,448 --> 00:42:12,916
...and stay with you till you get off drugs?
- No.

445
00:42:12,984 --> 00:42:15,612
- You think Steve's at your beck and call.
- No, I don't.

446
00:42:15,686 --> 00:42:18,280
Michelle, honey, why don't you cool out a little?

447
00:42:18,589 --> 00:42:21,183
You waltz back into town
and corrupt my husband...

448
00:42:21,259 --> 00:42:24,228
...and go out drinking all night
and no telling what else.

449
00:42:24,295 --> 00:42:26,388
I wouldn't do anything to hurt y'all.

450
00:42:26,564 --> 00:42:29,795
Why don't you stay in California?
You don't belong here.

451
00:42:29,867 --> 00:42:31,835
God damn it! That's enough.

452
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:36,128
This is my house. You don't come
in here talking that kind of shit.

453
00:42:36,207 --> 00:42:38,107
He's a guest in my house.

454
00:42:38,175 --> 00:42:40,405
Why would Steve ever care about you?

455
00:42:40,478 --> 00:42:43,003
- Why?
- Why? There's lots of reasons.

456
00:42:43,714 --> 00:42:46,239
You know what happened
in the summer of 1981?

457
00:42:46,317 --> 00:42:49,844
- Morgan, don't, man.
- Shut your mouth. She needs to hear this.

458
00:42:50,354 --> 00:42:52,720
You know Steve's dad was killed in a car wreck?

459
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:55,588
- Of course.
- His mom became a basket case.

460
00:42:55,993 --> 00:42:57,654
One night she goes on a binge.

461
00:42:58,095 --> 00:43:00,586
These guys get in the car
and drive all over town.

462
00:43:00,665 --> 00:43:03,725
Finally, Jesse sees her car outside
that shit-ass bar, Mike's.

463
00:43:03,801 --> 00:43:08,101
So, he goes in. There's Elaine sitting
in the booth with three fuckin' big dudes.

464
00:43:08,172 --> 00:43:11,073
She's out of it.
She's trying to get away from them.

465
00:43:11,208 --> 00:43:13,733
They're not letting her go.
She's half-undressed.

466
00:43:13,811 --> 00:43:16,803
He's a 16-year-old skinny fuckin' kid...

467
00:43:17,648 --> 00:43:21,812
...and he wades into them,
and they kick the living shit out of him.

468
00:43:22,053 --> 00:43:25,716
But when he comes out of Mike's,
he's got Steve's mom with him.

469
00:43:26,257 --> 00:43:29,852
To this fuckin' day
she don't know what he did for her.

470
00:43:30,294 --> 00:43:33,786
It's funny, she never did approve of Jesse.
She still don't.

471
00:43:33,864 --> 00:43:37,300
That's just one fuckin' story
about Jesse Parish. There's others.

472
00:43:38,135 --> 00:43:42,538
I told them that Jesse was going to have
to pack some clothes for this coming week.

473
00:43:43,207 --> 00:43:45,175
Just because you're going into the woods...

474
00:43:45,242 --> 00:43:48,439
...I don't want y'all to be slobs
and never change clothes.

475
00:43:48,512 --> 00:43:49,843
Come here.

476
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:54,242
God, I love you.

477
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,518
Squirrel hunting's great up here.

478
00:43:58,589 --> 00:44:01,649
I thought that was for shooting Jesse
if he tries to escape.

479
00:44:01,726 --> 00:44:06,060
That's funny. Y'all don't get it, do ya?
You fuckers are going to kill me.

480
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:08,189
You guys don't have clue one.

481
00:44:08,566 --> 00:44:12,058
Come on. Let's go back to the city
and get me fixed up.

482
00:44:13,904 --> 00:44:15,496
I can't do this.

483
00:44:15,873 --> 00:44:17,170
Look!

484
00:44:17,908 --> 00:44:19,842
There's nothing here.

485
00:45:32,183 --> 00:45:33,912
Wake up.

486
00:45:34,084 --> 00:45:35,847
- What?
- Jesse's gone.

487
00:45:36,921 --> 00:45:38,252
He's gone.

488
00:45:39,356 --> 00:45:41,984
- Fuck! You're supposed to watch him.
- I know.

489
00:45:42,526 --> 00:45:45,654
- I fall asleep for three hours...
- I'm sorry!

490
00:45:46,897 --> 00:45:48,387
- Shit!
- What?

491
00:45:48,466 --> 00:45:50,457
- My rifle's gone.
- Are you serious?

492
00:45:51,001 --> 00:45:53,492
Settle down. Go that way, I'll go this way.

493
00:45:53,571 --> 00:45:55,562
We'll make a circle. We'll find him.

494
00:45:55,639 --> 00:45:56,901
Hurry up.

495
00:46:02,947 --> 00:46:04,744
I shot two squirrels.

496
00:46:07,051 --> 00:46:09,986
- What's going on?
- You scared us half to death, cocksucker.

497
00:46:10,054 --> 00:46:13,785
You don't be leaving like that,
taking a rifle without letting us know.

498
00:46:14,892 --> 00:46:16,052
Sorry.

499
00:46:17,328 --> 00:46:19,853
- Why don't you cook these?
- Fuck you.

500
00:46:21,866 --> 00:46:23,458
So, you're okay?

501
00:46:23,968 --> 00:46:25,629
Everything's okay?

502
00:46:27,104 --> 00:46:30,471
I guess, but I'm afraid
I'm not out of the woods yet.

503
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:35,440
I'm looking for somebody that might live here...

504
00:46:35,513 --> 00:46:38,414
...an old friend of mine, his name's Jesse.

505
00:46:38,482 --> 00:46:39,972
No Jesse here.

506
00:46:40,117 --> 00:46:42,347
I think he lives with a guy named Gary.

507
00:46:42,586 --> 00:46:45,680
Gary's kind of fat, plays the drums.

508
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:51,056
Gary Dell, he's always drumming,
driving everybody crazy.

509
00:46:51,495 --> 00:46:52,962
He's in 422.

510
00:46:53,464 --> 00:46:56,160
If he's home, you'd know it.

511
00:46:59,336 --> 00:47:02,464
- You're a pain in my ass, man.
- I know.

512
00:47:03,007 --> 00:47:06,238
- Ever since you were a kid...
- I said, yeah. Lay off.

513
00:47:07,111 --> 00:47:10,547
Thank you, fellas. Be my valentine, all right?

514
00:47:12,016 --> 00:47:14,246
What do you want? A blow job?

515
00:47:17,121 --> 00:47:18,520
I don't know.

516
00:47:22,893 --> 00:47:25,623
Y'all are my friends. You saved my ass.

517
00:47:26,797 --> 00:47:31,564
Wish there was something I could do
to really thank you.

518
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:34,670
Are you serious about that blow job?

519
00:47:39,843 --> 00:47:41,811
Where the fuck is Jesse?

520
00:47:42,112 --> 00:47:45,206
Jesse split, man.
He's not staying here anymore.

521
00:47:45,416 --> 00:47:48,579
Look, I'm really not one of Jesse's friends.

522
00:47:49,053 --> 00:47:50,714
I should've known.

523
00:47:53,023 --> 00:47:55,583
Maybe he moved in with Bridget,
his old girlfriend.

524
00:47:55,726 --> 00:47:57,318
He said something about that.

525
00:47:57,494 --> 00:48:00,224
- Where does she live?
- Shit, I don't know.

526
00:48:01,465 --> 00:48:05,799
But she hangs out at Boardners.
Jesse hangs out there, too.

527
00:48:06,637 --> 00:48:09,128
It's on Cherokee just down from Hollywood.

528
00:48:15,546 --> 00:48:17,741
Hey, man. I'm back.

529
00:48:24,622 --> 00:48:26,112
Hey, shitheel.

530
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:46,600
Hey, man. You okay?
Come on, open up the door.

531
00:48:48,479 --> 00:48:51,471
- What's up?
- Nothing. What are you doing?

532
00:48:52,049 --> 00:48:53,914
Sitting here thinking.

533
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:57,817
Know what I realized?

534
00:48:58,889 --> 00:49:00,618
I was never very good at this.

535
00:49:02,359 --> 00:49:05,089
Come on, man, I got a date.
Get out of the bathroom.

536
00:49:05,429 --> 00:49:08,091
I've been meaning to talk to you
about something.

537
00:49:08,165 --> 00:49:09,291
What?

538
00:49:09,867 --> 00:49:12,131
It's about that money I got.

539
00:49:12,636 --> 00:49:14,126
Blackjack, right?

540
00:49:15,739 --> 00:49:17,104
I stole it.

541
00:49:18,308 --> 00:49:19,900
Out in LA.

542
00:49:20,611 --> 00:49:23,671
These two dudes
were trying to kill each other in a car...

543
00:49:23,747 --> 00:49:26,147
...some dope deal or something.

544
00:49:26,283 --> 00:49:29,377
I kind of stumbled on it and saw this briefcase.

545
00:49:30,721 --> 00:49:32,052
I took it.

546
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:34,052
Are you shitting me?

547
00:49:35,092 --> 00:49:36,616
I shit you not.

548
00:49:36,994 --> 00:49:39,519
How much money are we talking about?

549
00:49:42,099 --> 00:49:43,760
$200,000.

550
00:49:44,401 --> 00:49:45,663
God damn.

551
00:49:46,704 --> 00:49:48,729
- Where is it at?
- I hid it.

552
00:49:49,073 --> 00:49:51,337
- Where did you hide it?
- I buried it.

553
00:49:53,077 --> 00:49:55,978
I just felt bad about not telling you guys.

554
00:49:57,815 --> 00:50:01,808
All right, look. We got to keep this
between me and you, for one.

555
00:50:02,986 --> 00:50:05,511
I think it might make Steve nervous.

556
00:50:07,157 --> 00:50:09,682
What are you? A fuckin' outlaw, now?

557
00:50:09,893 --> 00:50:12,054
- I guess so.
- Shit.

558
00:50:13,297 --> 00:50:16,562
They know where you are?
Can they come here and track you down?

559
00:50:17,134 --> 00:50:18,158
No.

560
00:50:20,104 --> 00:50:21,162
I don't think so.

561
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:57,306
Hey, Bridget.

562
00:50:58,208 --> 00:51:00,335
How you doing tonight, honey?

563
00:51:02,846 --> 00:51:04,336
Where's Jesse?

564
00:51:04,748 --> 00:51:08,115
I don't know where he is. He's gone.

565
00:51:08,252 --> 00:51:09,810
I also don't know you.

566
00:51:10,254 --> 00:51:14,418
I'm sorry. I'm an old buddy of Jesse's.
He told me a lot about you.

567
00:51:14,992 --> 00:51:17,392
I thought he'd be here with you tonight.

568
00:51:17,461 --> 00:51:19,156
What can I get for you?

569
00:51:19,696 --> 00:51:22,426
Not a damn thing. Thank you, I'm fine.

570
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:24,863
Who are you, anyway?

571
00:51:25,636 --> 00:51:28,230
Like I said, I'm a friend of Jesse's.

572
00:51:28,806 --> 00:51:31,172
I was hoping you could help us find him.

573
00:51:32,142 --> 00:51:34,076
You're not a friend of his.

574
00:51:34,144 --> 00:51:35,236
I am.

575
00:51:36,213 --> 00:51:37,908
What do you want from him?

576
00:51:39,149 --> 00:51:40,946
I just want to talk to him.

577
00:51:47,691 --> 00:51:52,424
You know something, I got a good idea.
Why don't we go look for him together?

578
00:51:56,033 --> 00:51:57,500
I don't think so.

579
00:51:58,569 --> 00:52:00,366
Come on, it'll be fun.

580
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:05,271
Thanks for the offer, but I'll just stay here.
So just fuck off!

581
00:52:08,078 --> 00:52:09,340
Fuck off.

582
00:52:13,217 --> 00:52:16,277
Sorry, ma'am. I didn't mean to ruin your night.

583
00:52:28,932 --> 00:52:31,162
Why don't you get out of here?

584
00:53:06,303 --> 00:53:09,898
I'll ask you one more time, and then
cut your throat and find him myself.

585
00:53:09,973 --> 00:53:13,306
I'm not some fuckin' idiot.
You're not going to kill anybody here.

586
00:53:13,543 --> 00:53:16,444
You can't threaten me, you fuckin' redneck!

587
00:53:19,783 --> 00:53:21,774
Cut her a little, Calvin.

588
00:53:21,985 --> 00:53:23,384
I'd love to.

589
00:53:24,855 --> 00:53:26,117
Oh, baby.

590
00:53:32,429 --> 00:53:34,420
He left a message on my machine...

591
00:53:34,498 --> 00:53:37,729
...telling me he had to get out of town.

592
00:53:39,236 --> 00:53:43,935
He didn't tell me where. He wasn't
specific. Like San Francisco or Texas.

593
00:53:44,341 --> 00:53:48,300
- Where would he go in Texas?
- Galveston. That's where he's from.

594
00:53:48,512 --> 00:53:50,412
What's his last name? He have family?

595
00:53:50,547 --> 00:53:53,209
His granddad is from Galveston...

596
00:53:53,283 --> 00:53:56,150
...and his last name's Parish.

597
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:59,216
I don't know anymore, really, please...

598
00:53:59,656 --> 00:54:00,987
...can I go?

599
00:54:02,092 --> 00:54:04,686
Kill her and bury her. Let's get out of here.

600
00:54:05,329 --> 00:54:07,194
- Thanks. I want to go home.
- No.

601
00:54:08,165 --> 00:54:10,565
- My God.
- It's going to be all right.

602
00:54:11,001 --> 00:54:14,459
It won't be bad, baby, don't worry.

603
00:54:35,525 --> 00:54:38,289
Do you know what time it is, you son of a bitch?

604
00:54:38,428 --> 00:54:39,895
How did you know it was me, Red?

605
00:54:41,665 --> 00:54:43,428
How's life in the Lone Star State?

606
00:54:44,334 --> 00:54:47,235
It's lonesome, partner. How about you?

607
00:54:48,605 --> 00:54:50,835
Actually, I've been a lot better.

608
00:54:50,907 --> 00:54:55,173
You never call me just to shoot the shit.
You got a problem, what is it?

609
00:54:55,312 --> 00:55:00,181
I'm looking for an old boy. I think he
might be down in your neck of the woods.

610
00:55:01,084 --> 00:55:03,882
He's got a lot of my money,
I was hoping you could find him.

611
00:55:04,388 --> 00:55:07,448
- What's his name?
- His name's Jesse.

612
00:55:07,891 --> 00:55:09,119
Jesse Parish.

613
00:55:21,605 --> 00:55:23,266
It's your granddad.

614
00:55:24,808 --> 00:55:27,606
- Granddad?
- I need to talk to you, boy.

615
00:55:29,312 --> 00:55:33,180
- Okay.
- Not on the telephone. Out here.

616
00:55:34,384 --> 00:55:36,614
- Right now?
- Right now, boy.

617
00:55:37,387 --> 00:55:38,877
You coming or ain't you?

618
00:55:38,955 --> 00:55:41,583
- Sure.
- All right, then.

619
00:55:44,528 --> 00:55:45,961
All right, then.

620
00:56:07,684 --> 00:56:09,914
- What happened?
- I did.

621
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:15,487
I'm happening to you.

622
00:56:16,359 --> 00:56:19,055
A friend of mine says you
stole something from him.

623
00:56:19,129 --> 00:56:20,221
What friend?

624
00:56:20,297 --> 00:56:23,596
An old boy named Marshall Tanner
from Humboldt County, California.

625
00:56:23,834 --> 00:56:28,328
I don't know any Marshall Tanner.
I've never even been to Humboldt County.

626
00:56:30,373 --> 00:56:32,705
You been to LA, ain't you, baby?

627
00:56:33,143 --> 00:56:35,270
I'm looking for a briefcase.

628
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:39,205
I can get it for you. It's no problem.

629
00:56:40,684 --> 00:56:42,777
Promise that you'll let my granddad go.

630
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:45,745
All I care about is the money, baby.

631
00:56:49,192 --> 00:56:50,420
All right.

632
00:56:54,498 --> 00:56:55,658
Where is it at?

633
00:56:57,367 --> 00:57:00,632
I don't have it here,
but I can take you to it.

634
00:57:01,505 --> 00:57:02,767
So take me to it.

635
00:57:04,741 --> 00:57:07,107
How do I know you're not going
to kill me?

636
00:57:07,577 --> 00:57:10,102
Do I look like a killer to you, boy?

637
00:57:32,769 --> 00:57:33,997
Oh, God.

638
00:57:42,746 --> 00:57:45,340
He would've killed you for sure, boy.

639
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:49,280
Was that his car at the fruit stand?

640
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:08,737
Did Red call?

641
00:58:09,072 --> 00:58:11,666
He called from Galveston a while ago.

642
00:58:11,775 --> 00:58:14,539
He said he found out
where that punk's granddad lives.

643
00:58:15,111 --> 00:58:16,510
That's good.

644
00:58:17,514 --> 00:58:20,005
So Red's paying him a little visit?

645
00:58:20,383 --> 00:58:22,578
He should've already paid it.

646
00:58:23,019 --> 00:58:26,420
He said he'd call back in an hour,
that was two and half hours ago.

647
00:58:27,257 --> 00:58:31,125
- Can we trust Red?
- Red's a straight-up guy.

648
00:58:32,429 --> 00:58:35,489
There's only one reason Red
wouldn't call back.

649
00:58:35,565 --> 00:58:36,793
What's that?

650
00:58:37,133 --> 00:58:38,361
He's dead.

651
00:58:43,573 --> 00:58:44,562
Calvin?

652
00:58:45,875 --> 00:58:47,900
Get us on the first plane to Houston.

653
00:58:47,978 --> 00:58:51,914
Call the Wheeler brothers in Dallas.
Tell them to meet us at the airport.

654
00:58:52,849 --> 00:58:55,215
- Tell them we'll need some firearms.
- Done deal.

655
00:58:56,653 --> 00:59:00,749
I'm going to dump the body, so there's
no way he can be connected to you.

656
00:59:00,824 --> 00:59:04,260
I'm going to come back, get the car,
and leave Galveston.

657
00:59:06,363 --> 00:59:09,161
Listen, I think you ought to go somewhere, too.

658
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:13,900
I don't know how they tracked me down,
but there might be more of them coming.

659
00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:17,963
It's going to blow tonight, harder than they say.

660
00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:22,071
Are you all right?

661
00:59:24,614 --> 00:59:26,844
I'll be back as soon as I can.

662
00:59:38,561 --> 00:59:39,721
May I help you?

663
00:59:39,796 --> 00:59:42,697
Dell, party of four. We're going to Houston.

664
00:59:45,235 --> 00:59:47,726
Do you have a picture ID, Mr. Dell?

665
00:59:48,705 --> 00:59:51,139
- Do you have a picture ID?
- Of who?

666
00:59:52,275 --> 00:59:54,243
Who fuckin' cares?

667
01:01:39,716 --> 01:01:41,513
Are you the grandson?

668
01:01:43,286 --> 01:01:44,548
Yes, sir.

669
01:01:45,555 --> 01:01:46,886
How is he?

670
01:01:46,990 --> 01:01:49,788
How did he get those bruises on his face?

671
01:01:50,827 --> 01:01:54,524
He fell. I should've been there.

672
01:01:55,665 --> 01:01:57,428
These things happen.

673
01:01:58,101 --> 01:02:01,264
- Can I see him?
- He's had a heart attack.

674
01:02:02,372 --> 01:02:05,808
- Is he going to make it?
- We'll have to wait and see.

675
01:02:09,579 --> 01:02:11,240
I don't know, man.

676
01:02:12,015 --> 01:02:16,247
Listen to me. I woke up this morning
and he was gone. He didn't leave a note.

677
01:02:16,453 --> 01:02:18,045
Is his stuff still there?

678
01:02:21,157 --> 01:02:23,284
Then I'm sure he'll be back.

679
01:02:25,028 --> 01:02:28,828
Listen, you don't got to worry about Jesse.
He's fine.

680
01:02:31,901 --> 01:02:34,199
Louis, Jimmy, let's go.

681
01:02:55,992 --> 01:02:57,391
Thanks, man.

682
01:03:00,763 --> 01:03:02,128
I love these things.

683
01:03:02,699 --> 01:03:04,098
Good for me.

684
01:04:01,658 --> 01:04:03,853
How come you ain't gone, son?

685
01:04:09,799 --> 01:04:11,824
I'll be here when you get back.

686
01:04:14,537 --> 01:04:15,765
Now, get.

687
01:04:38,361 --> 01:04:40,386
Jeremy, honey, come inside.

688
01:04:45,802 --> 01:04:47,770
Come on. Let's get ready for dinner.

689
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:52,273
I'm sure he'll be back by tonight.

690
01:04:53,676 --> 01:04:55,769
I'm worried about Michelle.

691
01:04:58,414 --> 01:05:01,781
You know how it is, I really love her.

692
01:05:02,552 --> 01:05:04,213
Too much, probably.

693
01:05:06,556 --> 01:05:09,548
I think of her as delicate and easily-injured...

694
01:05:09,626 --> 01:05:12,288
...but she's about as sturdy as they come.

695
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:20,663
The thing is, Morgan,
you never can tell with these storms.

696
01:05:20,770 --> 01:05:24,001
I was even thinking
about getting her out of the water.

697
01:05:24,641 --> 01:05:26,666
I might go to the marina after supper.

698
01:05:26,743 --> 01:05:29,541
If you're not busy, you want to come along?

699
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:32,743
My wife just bit me.

700
01:05:33,783 --> 01:05:35,114
I have no idea.

701
01:05:43,926 --> 01:05:45,188
Nobody's home.

702
01:05:46,329 --> 01:05:49,264
Calvin, you and the boys go and check it out.

703
01:06:19,529 --> 01:06:22,089
Damn weather. How you doing?

704
01:06:22,432 --> 01:06:24,263
We're fine. How are you, ma'am?

705
01:06:24,801 --> 01:06:27,292
- Nobody home?
- Doesn't look like it.

706
01:06:28,104 --> 01:06:31,005
That's strange. Mr. Parish is always here.

707
01:06:32,108 --> 01:06:34,440
I wonder where he could've gone.

708
01:06:35,611 --> 01:06:39,308
I came to give him some cinnamon rolls.
He loves my cinnamon rolls.

709
01:06:39,782 --> 01:06:42,478
I'm Mrs. Lawson. I live down the road.

710
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:46,547
Y'all friends of Mr. Parish?

711
01:06:47,957 --> 01:06:51,154
Ma'am! Can I see you over here
for just a minute?

712
01:06:52,595 --> 01:06:56,725
We're friends of Mr. Parish's grandson, Jesse.

713
01:06:57,433 --> 01:06:58,923
You know Jesse!

714
01:06:59,001 --> 01:07:01,697
Yes, ma'am. We go way back.
He's a good old boy.

715
01:07:01,938 --> 01:07:03,735
He sure is, ain't he?

716
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:07,405
It's real important that we get
a hold of him. It's about a job.

717
01:07:07,477 --> 01:07:11,004
He ain't staying with his grandpapa.
He's staying with his friend Morgan.

718
01:07:14,717 --> 01:07:16,446
Hold it one minute.

719
01:07:18,154 --> 01:07:20,418
Let me see if I understand you correctly.

720
01:07:20,690 --> 01:07:23,215
You mentioned something about a job?

721
01:07:25,561 --> 01:07:28,826
You're not involved in the music business,
are you?

722
01:07:30,133 --> 01:07:31,828
Yes, ma'am.

723
01:07:32,168 --> 01:07:35,831
I can't say I'm always proud of it,
but we are in the music business.

724
01:07:37,373 --> 01:07:39,000
That's wonderful!

725
01:07:41,978 --> 01:07:44,811
Can you tell us where his friend Morgan lives?

726
01:07:45,047 --> 01:07:46,844
Sure, I can tell you.

727
01:07:47,283 --> 01:07:49,308
Jesse's going to be so happy.

728
01:07:49,452 --> 01:07:51,079
I bet he will be.

729
01:07:51,988 --> 01:07:53,615
I'm starting to get worried.

730
01:07:53,689 --> 01:07:55,088
Maybe he's at his granddad's.

731
01:07:55,158 --> 01:07:57,786
He ain't. I called over there.
There ain't no answer.

732
01:07:58,127 --> 01:08:01,119
Maybe he decided
to become a drug addict again.

733
01:08:07,670 --> 01:08:09,194
Where you been?

734
01:08:13,643 --> 01:08:15,235
What's going on?

735
01:08:15,545 --> 01:08:17,012
They're here.

736
01:08:19,148 --> 01:08:20,342
What's going on?

737
01:08:20,416 --> 01:08:24,352
- Where are you going?
- As far away as I can fuckin' get.

738
01:08:24,587 --> 01:08:26,020
For everybody's sake.

739
01:08:26,522 --> 01:08:29,685
God damn! Will somebody tell me
what's happening?

740
01:08:30,326 --> 01:08:31,987
Granddad killed someone.

741
01:08:32,061 --> 01:08:34,029
Killed someone? Who?

742
01:08:34,096 --> 01:08:37,065
I don't know. Some guy. He would've killed me.

743
01:08:37,266 --> 01:08:41,259
- Why would he have killed you?
- Because out in LA, I stole some money.

744
01:08:41,771 --> 01:08:43,295
A lot of money.

745
01:08:44,674 --> 01:08:46,801
But I got the bastard's gun.

746
01:08:48,311 --> 01:08:50,575
- Why don't you go play?
- Play what, Daddy?

747
01:08:50,646 --> 01:08:52,136
I don't know. Just go play.

748
01:08:52,215 --> 01:08:54,547
The last thing I want is to drag y'all into this.

749
01:08:54,617 --> 01:08:57,245
I'm just going to go as far away as I can.

750
01:08:57,320 --> 01:09:01,654
Call and let them know where the money is.
They'll be on my ass forever if I don't.

751
01:09:01,724 --> 01:09:05,990
Why didn't you tell me about this?
Isn't there any end to it with you?

752
01:09:06,262 --> 01:09:08,230
This is the end, Stevie.

753
01:09:10,032 --> 01:09:11,795
You're right, it is.

754
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:18,771
All right.

755
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:24,011
I just want to thank you guys
for everything.

756
01:09:25,414 --> 01:09:26,574
Adios.

757
01:09:27,550 --> 01:09:28,778
Come on.

758
01:09:34,290 --> 01:09:36,884
You're telling me you knew about this
the whole time?

759
01:09:36,993 --> 01:09:39,052
Why do you guys have little secrets?

760
01:09:39,228 --> 01:09:40,991
Why didn't you tell me?

761
01:09:41,063 --> 01:09:43,793
Steve, I didn't want you to
get worried.

762
01:09:45,301 --> 01:09:46,928
Daddy, come here!

763
01:09:47,303 --> 01:09:49,737
You didn't want me to get worried?

764
01:09:49,939 --> 01:09:52,169
Come on, fuck it, you know...

765
01:09:52,909 --> 01:09:54,240
Daddy, come here.

766
01:09:54,310 --> 01:09:57,074
You're a fucking asshole, man. Both of you.

767
01:09:59,048 --> 01:10:00,140
What, Jeremy?

768
01:10:06,422 --> 01:10:08,822
There's nothing in this guitar case.

769
01:10:10,326 --> 01:10:12,089
All right, where's the money?

770
01:10:15,798 --> 01:10:18,733
Son, you'd better tell me where the money is.

771
01:10:18,801 --> 01:10:23,431
You're never going to find it without me,
so we might as well make a deal.

772
01:10:24,807 --> 01:10:26,900
Jimmy, turn the car around.

773
01:10:34,350 --> 01:10:36,079
Where are we going?

774
01:10:36,218 --> 01:10:39,585
Back to your friend's place
and kill everybody there.

775
01:10:45,861 --> 01:10:47,192
All right.

776
01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:49,254
Damn it.

777
01:10:49,966 --> 01:10:52,025
There ain't nobody down there.

778
01:10:52,134 --> 01:10:53,999
- Who are you calling?
- The police.

779
01:10:54,136 --> 01:10:56,229
You can't do that. Hang up the phone.

780
01:10:56,305 --> 01:10:58,364
- Why?
- Jesse has a shitload of drug money.

781
01:10:58,441 --> 01:10:59,874
You can't involve the cops.

782
01:10:59,942 --> 01:11:02,740
I'm not sure stealing money from criminals
is a crime.

783
01:11:02,812 --> 01:11:04,609
If they arrest him, he'll be alive.

784
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:08,138
Listen, if this ain't handled right,
Jesse's going to wind up dead.

785
01:11:08,217 --> 01:11:09,912
Hang up that fuckin' phone.

786
01:11:16,192 --> 01:11:17,921
What are you doing?

787
01:11:21,197 --> 01:11:23,062
I've got a family to think about.

788
01:11:23,232 --> 01:11:25,530
Nobody's asking you to come along.

789
01:11:25,601 --> 01:11:28,126
Where? You don't know where they're going.

790
01:11:28,204 --> 01:11:29,330
Sure, I do.

791
01:11:29,405 --> 01:11:32,135
They'll make Jesse take them
where he buried the money.

792
01:11:32,208 --> 01:11:35,302
If you were him,
where would you bury that money?

793
01:11:38,347 --> 01:11:40,247
I'm going to need your boat.

794
01:11:42,952 --> 01:11:45,921
- How far away is this fuckin' island?
- About half an hour.

795
01:11:46,188 --> 01:11:49,089
- How do we get there? Swim?
- I got a boat.

796
01:11:50,126 --> 01:11:52,651
There ain't nobody out there.
This place is closed.

797
01:11:52,728 --> 01:11:54,286
I have the keys. I know the owner.

798
01:11:54,363 --> 01:11:57,457
You wouldn't be lying to us,
would you, skipper?

799
01:11:58,334 --> 01:11:59,824
He called him "skipper."

800
01:12:03,439 --> 01:12:04,599
Honey?

801
01:12:06,976 --> 01:12:08,500
What's the matter?

802
01:12:08,677 --> 01:12:09,905
Nothing.

803
01:12:13,949 --> 01:12:16,315
- It's okay, Mommy.
- What's going on?

804
01:12:16,585 --> 01:12:18,382
Daddy's playing with his friends.

805
01:12:24,427 --> 01:12:27,362
It seems pretty rough out past the breakwater.

806
01:12:27,496 --> 01:12:29,987
What do you want me to do about it?

807
01:12:51,587 --> 01:12:54,750
You know how this works, right?
Just fire and pump.

808
01:12:55,724 --> 01:12:57,248
I'm not touching that thing.

809
01:12:57,326 --> 01:13:00,989
I'm taking you to the island, but that's it.
I'm staying with the boat.

810
01:13:01,097 --> 01:13:04,191
God damn it! This is for just in case. Take it.

811
01:13:07,470 --> 01:13:11,065
You're happy about this?
You might get a chance to shoot people.

812
01:13:11,140 --> 01:13:13,005
You act like I want this to happen.

813
01:13:13,075 --> 01:13:14,975
- You said it.
- That's bullshit!

814
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:25,909
That's it.

815
01:13:30,693 --> 01:13:34,254
- Fuckin' psycho.
- Think what you want. I don't give a shit.

816
01:13:36,765 --> 01:13:40,223
Let's go. Calvin, get that shovel
and that flashlight.

817
01:13:45,107 --> 01:13:49,237
- I'm in a different position here.
- You got to do what you got to do.

818
01:13:49,478 --> 01:13:53,915
I got to do what I got to do.
Get me out there, I'll take care of the rest.

819
01:13:56,652 --> 01:14:00,053
You little fuck, you caused me a lot
of trouble. Where's my money?

820
01:14:00,122 --> 01:14:01,851
The other side of the island.

821
01:14:01,924 --> 01:14:04,256
What the fuck are we doing on this side, then?

822
01:14:04,326 --> 01:14:07,090
The boat would've capsized on the other side...

823
01:14:07,163 --> 01:14:09,028
...and we would've drowned, idiot!

824
01:14:09,098 --> 01:14:11,999
- Who's the idiot?
- God damn it!

825
01:14:12,201 --> 01:14:14,999
You want me to blow your fuckin' brains out?

826
01:14:15,204 --> 01:14:18,367
Let's go. You lead the way, Jesse.
Give him a flashlight.

827
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:21,807
- Take this, boy.
- Louis, give me that flashlight.

828
01:14:38,027 --> 01:14:40,325
Where the hell is he taking us?

829
01:14:43,766 --> 01:14:47,930
- Can't this thing go any faster?
- Not in this weather.

830
01:14:50,506 --> 01:14:53,441
- Move!
- Move that little pissant along!

831
01:14:57,947 --> 01:14:59,437
We were right.

832
01:15:04,954 --> 01:15:07,650
I need you to keep your fuckin' eyes peeled.

833
01:15:07,723 --> 01:15:10,692
You see any crazy shit go down,
you get your ass out of here.

834
01:15:12,628 --> 01:15:15,893
This little punk is either jerking us off
or we're lost.

835
01:15:15,965 --> 01:15:18,160
I've never been here at night before.

836
01:15:18,234 --> 01:15:21,294
You fuckin' find the money, punk!
You understand me?

837
01:15:21,370 --> 01:15:22,928
Get the fuck out of here!

838
01:15:23,038 --> 01:15:25,006
We'll see you real soon.

839
01:15:28,611 --> 01:15:30,943
You don't know how many of them there are.

840
01:15:31,347 --> 01:15:34,510
They're not going to be packing
what I'm packing.

841
01:15:52,735 --> 01:15:54,498
All right! Come on.

842
01:16:06,515 --> 01:16:08,415
This whole thing sucks!

843
01:16:09,785 --> 01:16:11,878
This better be it, asshole.

844
01:16:14,723 --> 01:16:15,690
Is this it?

845
01:16:55,931 --> 01:16:58,229
Shit! There's about 20 of them.

846
01:16:58,334 --> 01:16:59,733
I count six.

847
01:17:01,136 --> 01:17:02,933
Here's what we're going to do.

848
01:17:03,205 --> 01:17:04,968
I'll cut to the right...

849
01:17:05,207 --> 01:17:08,370
...you get on the other side of them, over there.

850
01:17:08,711 --> 01:17:10,474
You don't move until I do.

851
01:17:10,913 --> 01:17:14,474
We'll catch them in our crossfire
and cut them to pieces.

852
01:17:15,684 --> 01:17:16,946
Got that?

853
01:17:26,261 --> 01:17:28,320
What the hell's going on here?

854
01:17:28,530 --> 01:17:30,122
He's dicking us!

855
01:17:43,579 --> 01:17:45,376
All right, you fuckin' assholes!

856
01:17:49,518 --> 01:17:51,645
Drop your weapons right now!

857
01:17:58,961 --> 01:18:00,792
Drop them like he said!

858
01:18:03,298 --> 01:18:04,925
I said drop them!

859
01:18:05,367 --> 01:18:06,698
Drop them!

860
01:18:08,337 --> 01:18:09,634
Take it easy, boys.

861
01:18:25,521 --> 01:18:27,045
Son of a bitch!

862
01:18:36,565 --> 01:18:38,226
Come on! Let's go.

863
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:39,724
Come on!

864
01:18:42,004 --> 01:18:44,939
- Shit!
- One of those fuckin' punks killed Duff.

865
01:18:51,747 --> 01:18:52,839
Shit!

866
01:18:56,652 --> 01:18:59,485
- What about Morgan?
- He said to meet us at the boat.

867
01:19:05,194 --> 01:19:07,594
You know, we could be walking into a trap.

868
01:19:07,996 --> 01:19:09,657
- We got to split up.
- Right.

869
01:19:09,731 --> 01:19:12,495
- Calvin, go on out that way.
- I'm gone.

870
01:19:12,568 --> 01:19:14,468
- I'm with you.
- Come on.

871
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:26,945
You shot my brother!

872
01:19:28,917 --> 01:19:31,249
You're dead, you son of a bitch!

873
01:19:44,766 --> 01:19:46,028
- Hold it!
- What?

874
01:19:46,101 --> 01:19:48,626
This is stupid. Let's wait for him.

875
01:19:54,243 --> 01:19:55,301
Now!

876
01:19:58,347 --> 01:20:00,645
Come on. Shoot him.

877
01:20:15,097 --> 01:20:16,724
- Shit!
- I'm sorry.

878
01:20:17,366 --> 01:20:20,096
Damn it! If you're going to be here,
don't freeze up.

879
01:20:47,162 --> 01:20:48,390
Fuck!

880
01:21:23,932 --> 01:21:24,990
Shoot him!

881
01:21:35,544 --> 01:21:37,011
Cut your...

882
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:39,470
You little...

883
01:21:43,218 --> 01:21:45,448
- Are you hit?
- My leg.

884
01:21:48,757 --> 01:21:51,055
Come on, let's get out of here.

885
01:21:54,496 --> 01:21:55,895
Fuck!

886
01:22:00,636 --> 01:22:03,036
- Shit, where is he?
- I don't know.

887
01:22:09,978 --> 01:22:12,276
I'm going to go back and find him.

888
01:22:19,287 --> 01:22:20,549
It's him.

889
01:22:21,189 --> 01:22:24,283
- You okay?
- Kicked them fuckers' ass, didn't we?

890
01:22:25,627 --> 01:22:28,790
- You're hit.
- Let's get the hell out of here.

891
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,161
Here! Grab him. I'll be right back.

892
01:22:45,781 --> 01:22:47,908
- You know what, Steve?
- What?

893
01:22:49,017 --> 01:22:51,611
It's quiet without all those guns.

894
01:22:51,687 --> 01:22:54,212
What the fuck are you talking about?

895
01:23:01,463 --> 01:23:03,897
I got my money, you fuckin' punks!

896
01:23:10,038 --> 01:23:11,562
He shot Morgan!

897
01:23:12,708 --> 01:23:14,835
Shot Morgan?

898
01:23:55,584 --> 01:23:57,609
Let's get him to the boat.

899
01:23:58,787 --> 01:24:00,220
Don't move me.

900
01:24:02,524 --> 01:24:05,687
Stevie boy, I knew you'd come with me,
you fuck.

901
01:24:07,529 --> 01:24:08,553
You knew?

902
01:24:09,798 --> 01:24:11,891
Of course I was going to come.

903
01:24:15,103 --> 01:24:16,434
Hang in there.

904
01:24:17,139 --> 01:24:18,197
I will.

905
01:24:20,742 --> 01:24:22,710
You hang in there, okay?

906
01:24:26,548 --> 01:24:27,537
I will.

907
01:24:29,151 --> 01:24:30,516
I'm scared.

908
01:25:43,792 --> 01:25:45,657
Glad to see you're stirring around.

909
01:25:47,696 --> 01:25:50,529
Figured it was time.
I've been driving Michelle crazy.

910
01:25:50,599 --> 01:25:52,760
- Hey, kid.
- Say hi to your Uncle.

911
01:25:52,834 --> 01:25:54,426
Hi, Uncle Jesse.

912
01:25:55,937 --> 01:25:57,598
This is how you spent the money?

913
01:25:58,173 --> 01:26:01,370
This and the funeral.
There wasn't that much left.

914
01:26:02,344 --> 01:26:05,711
Me and Granddad figured
we'd get the bait shop up and going again.

915
01:26:05,814 --> 01:26:06,940
No kidding?

916
01:26:07,582 --> 01:26:09,106
Good for y'all.

917
01:26:16,825 --> 01:26:18,486
Steve, you know...

918
01:26:19,261 --> 01:26:22,355
...if I could trade places with Morgan, I would.

919
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:33,969
Still feel like going out there?

920
01:26:36,244 --> 01:26:37,836
It's a good day for it.

921
01:27:25,026 --> 01:27:27,586
"Some day we'll come back
and dig up the treasure."

922
01:27:27,662 --> 01:27:30,460
- And we'll never split up.
- "And we'll never split up."

923
01:27:30,532 --> 01:27:32,329
"We'll never split up."
