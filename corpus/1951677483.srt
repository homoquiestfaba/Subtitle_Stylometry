1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:02:13,159
THE KEYS TO THE HOUSE

2
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,289
How old was he here?

3
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,099
Six.

4
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:38,229
He still wasn't walking.

5
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,729
Livia filled the whole house
with footballs.

6
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,139
He crawled around everywhere.
just like a puppy.

7
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,900
Does he look like me now?

8
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,310
No. he's just like his mother.

9
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:58,469
That's what Livia always says.

10
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,129
Your wife hates me.

11
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:05,509
That's not true.

12
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,270
You have to understand her.

13
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,330
You died along with her sister.

14
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,319
Why the decision
to let me see him now?

15
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,099
The doctor said to.

16
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,949
Maybe if he sees his father
a miracle will happen.

17
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:32,319
lt works lots oftimes.

18
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:39,340
Sorry if l made you come so far.

19
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,159
l had problems at work.

20
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,689
Every so often
a trip's a good thing.

21
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,849
l've got dealings here.

22
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:58,460
- Does Paolo know who l am?
- Sure.

23
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,210
What does he say?

24
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,699
What can he say?

25
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,539
You can't even imagine
what he's like.

26
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,139
At home he calls us
Alberto and Livia.

27
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:15,669
Outside.

28
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,310
''my uncle. my aunt.''
''my father. my mother...''

29
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,910
He's a super kid.

30
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:26,089
You don't deserve him.

31
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:37,540
Your life's on an even keel now.
The baby's growing. wife's happy.

32
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,769
- l should go.
- There's time. have your coffee.

33
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,149
- What do l say when he wakes up?
- Whatever you want.

34
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,540
Don't you want your coffee?

35
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,439
Paolo?

36
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,189
That's me.

37
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:56,430
What is it?
You got anything to tell me?

38
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:59,029
l brought your shoes.

39
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:02,319
l woke up and didn't see you.

40
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:06,389
Everything all right? l mean...

41
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,269
To the right.

42
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,379
- How did you sleep last night?
- On my tummy.

43
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,399
You. on your side?

44
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,920
- Did l snore?
- Something awful!

45
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,440
l snored that much?

46
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:40,529
Did they tell you my name?

47
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,179
Gianni.

48
00:08:53,669 --> 00:08:55,389
You want my number?

49
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:57,230

50
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,990
Get a pen and paper.

51
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,539
l don't have a pen.

52
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,090
How about later?

53
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,570
So., it's 06...

54
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,940

55
00:09:16,669 --> 00:09:19,200
- You want mine?
- Give it to me.

56
00:09:19,669 --> 00:09:22,860

l'll write it down for you later.

60
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,850
And then l'll write yours too.

61
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,100
Do you know where l live?

62
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,299
ln Milan.

63
00:09:43,669 --> 00:09:45,389
Where's that?

64
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:54,850
Hear the music? Shall l turn it up?

65
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,190
No., l hear it.

66
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,100
Turn it down a bit.
it might bother people.

67
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,000
Does it bother you?

68
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,320
Does it bother you?
No. it's OK.

69
00:10:24,789 --> 00:10:27,279
Let's go get ready.
this is our stop.

70
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:30,759
Want some help?

71
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,320
Don't hold on to me.

72
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,070
l shouldn't hold on to you?
You're OK by yourself?

73
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,120
l'll say it for the last time.
l can do it myself!

74
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,200
Pull my underwear down
or l'll get it wet.

75
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:32,919
Go away. l can't concentrate.

76
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,129
l'll stand here
and won't look at you.

77
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:45,519
Then you can help me
put my shirt on.

78
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,039
Sure. l'll put it on for you.

79
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,899

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,820
Don't look at me.

83
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,549
l'm not looking. don't worry.

84
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:14,240
Nice., eh?

85
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,059
l even have the postcard at home.

86
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,740
with ''Berlin'' written on it.
and ''Lazio''.

87
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,580
Do you know the way?

88
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,490
Straight ahead. then right.

89
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:40,450
go over the bridge
and you get to my house.

90
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,480
Number ten. Via Persio.

91
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:46,769
My number is 7182402.

92
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,539
My mobile phone...

93
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,029
What's the mattter with the boy?

94
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,200
l don't understand.

95
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,720
He doesn't understand.

96
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,970
Straight ahead.
then right and we're there.

97
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:03,360
My brother is like him.

98
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,879
He's in a wheelchair.

99
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,659
l don't understand German.

100
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,539
He doesn't understand.

101
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,629
Look.

102
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,750
Yes. give it back to the man.

103
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,960
Shall we go?

104
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,600
Are we in the hotel or the hospital?

105
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:41,929
We go to the hospital later.

106
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,000
With all these suitcases?

107
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,620
They're not ours.
they belong to the guests.

108
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,450
Do they have to be operated on too?

109
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:55,009
What do you think?

110
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:04,879
Come along.

111
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,179
l'm taller than the hospital.

112
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:11,470
You're a giant.

113
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,629
Now we go to the 12th floor.
Orthoµädi'sche für Ki'nder.

114
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:18,909
''Children's Orthopaedics''. in German.

115
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:22,840
l slept in this hospital once.

116
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:27,830
Will l have to tonight?

117
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,860
No. tonight we sleep in the hotel.

118
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,500
So what did we come for?
To waste time?

119
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,169
No. l have to do
a few things for admitttance.

120
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,500
What is it?

121
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,570
- What's that kid's name?
- l don't know.

122
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,250
He knows you though.

126
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,399
- Are you the boy's father?
- Yes.

127
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,860
But you and he not the same name.

128
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,450
His mother and l weren't married.
There's my power of atttorney.

129
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:27,330
Doesn't mattter power of atttorney.
We treat disease. no private life.

130
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,820
Can you see the match here?

131
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,899
Can you see the match on TV?

132
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:50,210
The match!

133
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,360

No.

135
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,299
No. so l'm leaving.

136
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,590
At this point.

137
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,980
Now they take blood.

138
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,049
l've had it. l want to go home!

139
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,789
l went home...

140
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,079
ln those hospitals...

141
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:41,160
a stink of cigaretttes!

142
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:48,210
Something awful!

143
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,779
- Do you smoke?
- No.

144
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,519
l do. tobacco.

145
00:18:12,109 --> 00:18:13,829
Smoking's bad for you.

146
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:16,549
l have to smoke?

147
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,599
Do like this.

148
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,859
- Breathe the smoke out.
- All around?

149
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:37,539
What are you doing?

150
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:44,900
What the heck's he saying?

151
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:48,480
l don't understand German.

152
00:18:52,829 --> 00:18:54,130
Just get on with it.

153
00:18:57,589 --> 00:18:59,730
He's caressing me.

154
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,759
lt's nothing. thanks.

155
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,650
ls this your first time here?

156
00:20:21,829 --> 00:20:24,640
lt's rough the first time.

157
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,660
lt's strange to see a man here.

158
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,630
This is the mothers' dirty work.

159
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,710
The fathers can't take it.

160
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,259
With one excuse or another.

161
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:47,950
they back out.

162
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:55,849
My husband has always been afraid
to get close to our daughter.

163
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,450
to touch her.

164
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,569
Afraid he'd hurt her.

165
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,440
Excuse me.

166
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,519
Are you this boy's father?

167
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,400
No. l'm not.

168
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:25,589
They took a blood sample.

169
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,240
- They took my blood...
- Shall l put my hand here?

170
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:41,970
Will you let me cut it?

171
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:47,769
lt's almost all cut up.

172
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,960
Tiny. tiny pieces?

173
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,730
- But l feed myself.
- OK.

174
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:01,349
Don't you like steak?

175
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,440
l'm not hungry.

176
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,880
Did Alberto give you
the money to pay?

177
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,119
No. l've got money.

178
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:18,240
- How much have you got?
- Enough for a meal.

179
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,509
Have you got a good job?

180
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:23,910
Yes. l work in a company.

181
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,970
lnside a company. or outside?

182
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,559
- No. for a company.
- Inside or outside?

183
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:37,210
lnside. but sometimes even outside
to check things.

184
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:40,220
What does this company do?

185
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,450

186
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:53,329

You can't imagine
all the stuffthey've told me!

190
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:18,319
They told me you're my father.

191
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,859
Just teasing me. some ofthem.

192
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,549
They weren't teasing you.

193
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,720
So that's all right.

194
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,190
Want another chip?

195
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,549
We'll go back to the hotel

Then l have to go to school.

202
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:24,069
Don't worry.
you don't have to go to school.

203
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,400
That's good.

204
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:31,730
- Don't you like going to school?
- Not too much.

205
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:38,849
l have an assistant teacher
and the others don't.

206
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,059

207
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:47,410

- No.

208
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:50,410

215
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,039
That's enough.

So. you like it?

217

Now l don't want any more.

219
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:06,150
He wanted to walk alone.
with his walking stick.

220
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:09,859
He hangs onto that stick.
never tires.

221
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,299
He'll be admittted tomorrow.

222
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,720

223
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:19,650
He wasn't scared at all.

224
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:22,259
he joked. enjoyed himself.

225
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,519
He remembered my name.

226
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,779
he was friendly right off.

227
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,180
This morning when he saw me...
What is it?

228
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:37,630
Did he wake up?

229
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:41,019
He'll cry a litttle.

because my father's alone.

233
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,019
The other daughter's alone...

234
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,509
We have to go back inside now.

You forgot.

247
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,230

00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:03,480

Lower the volume. it's too loud.

00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,650
You have to turn the volume down.

253
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,320
What the heck do you want?

254
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,559
Lower it. it's too loud.

255
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,829
The other arm first.

256

00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:31,630

Put them away or you'll lose them.

00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,110
Once. Alberto lost
the ones for the car.

275
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,550
Only if someone's there.

00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,070
This is my girlfriend.

277
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,199

338
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,000

Only one person can be here.

00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,150
But he didn't tell me to leave.

346
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:50,460

347
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,610

l've said it five times.

351
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,530
Reading in this light
hurts your eyes.

352
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:27,340
lt's a book l can't put down.
Do you know it?

357
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:54,760
Will the boy be sleeping
here this evening?

358
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,389
They're running tests.

359
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:04,409
He kicked me out.

360
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:06,840
My daughter too.

361
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:11,349
When she draws with colours...

362
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,639
- When she...?
- Paints.

363
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:18,630
When she plays with colours
she doesn't want anyone around.

364
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,769
So you're at a loose end too.

365
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:25,969
l'm a useless person this evening.

366
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:43,059
Yesterday in the hospital.

367
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:46,360
you made a strange impression on me.

368
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,739
You thought l was nosy.

369
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,179
When you spend lots oftime
in the hospital

370
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:57,170
you get curious
about other people's lives.

371
00:43:57,639 --> 00:43:59,989
and even a litttle forward.

372
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:04,070
Do you come to Berlin often?

373
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,400
Every six months.

374
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,800
Nadine has to do her therapy.

375
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,139
Now we live in Lyon.

376
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,110
- And you?
- Near Milan.

377
00:44:16,679 --> 00:44:18,929
l transferred for work.

378
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:23,780
When l was studying in Italy.
l thought l'd live there forever.

379
00:44:24,519 --> 00:44:26,130
l had so many plans.

380
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,199
What do you do now?

381
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:32,780
l always answer this with.
''l don't do anything.''

382
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,179
What do you mean. nothing?

383
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,750
Nothing.

384
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:41,239
Since the day my daughter was born.

385
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,519
You love her very much.

386
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:49,059
Sorry?

387
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,199
Maybe l understand.

388
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:54,539
l love Paolo very much.
that's true.

389
00:44:56,599 --> 00:44:58,809
- Don't you have children?
- l do.

390
00:44:59,239 --> 00:45:02,929
An eight-month-old boy. Francesco.

391
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,670
lt's kind of you
to look after Paolo too.

392
00:45:08,199 --> 00:45:10,059
Why do you do it?

393
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,690
Need to be forgiven for something?

394
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:17,320
Maybe.

395
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:20,710
l was joking!

396
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,260
l meant it's a big task.

397
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:26,659
Are Paolo's parents
relatives of yours?

398
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:30,340
They're my friends.
l'm like family.

399
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,679
Excuse me a moment.

400
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,929
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

401
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,909
More than a friend ofthe family.

402
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:18,550
you seemed like
Paolo's father yesterday.

403
00:46:20,679 --> 00:46:25,909
You had the same look as my husband
when he'd go out with Nadine.

404
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:30,170
An apprehensive look.

405
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,480
embarrassed.

406
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,289
like excusing yourself
with people for disturbing.

407
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,579
l'm not used to it.
l'm afraid l'll make a mistake.

408
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,570
lt's obvious.

409
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,500
How?

410
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,449
l don't know.

411
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,590
As l watched you l thought.

412
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:56,409
''This man is ashamed.''

413
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,219
ls your phone off?

414
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:06,929
They're not allowed in hospitals.

415
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,679
Good night.

416
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:28,340
Let me catch my breath a minute.

417
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:26,780
The other arm first
or you'll hurt me.

418
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,550
You'll have to learn.

419
00:52:35,559 --> 00:52:40,199
Left when it goes on.
right when it comes off.

420
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,840
Want an orange juice?

421
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:50,000
Something to eat?

422
00:52:51,559 --> 00:52:53,559
An orange juice with two straws.

423
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:09,610
Hi. how are you?

424
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,769
- Do you remember me?
- Yes.

425
00:53:16,599 --> 00:53:20,250
That girl isn't very normal.

426
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,070
My daughter?

427
00:53:22,679 --> 00:53:26,230
The one in the bed. Iying like this.

428
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:28,630
Sleeping.

429
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:32,610
- Can you understand her?
- Sure l can.

430
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:36,820
Go inside.,

431
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:41,920
ask Gianni to get me
a cheese sandwich.

432
00:53:42,679 --> 00:53:45,000
with ''nothing on it''
writtten on it.

433
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,010
Paolo said he's hungry.

434
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,010
Thanks.

435
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,769
What trouble did you cause?

436
00:54:05,239 --> 00:54:07,199
None. why?

437
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:09,389
The doctor is very angry.

438
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:14,619
She says the real problem
with some children isn't the disease.

439
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,000
it's the parents.

440
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:22,789
Paolo is your son. isn't he?

441
00:54:23,239 --> 00:54:24,960
Yes.

442
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:28,650
Tell the doctor l don't care
if he doesn't walk well.

443
00:54:29,239 --> 00:54:31,199
it's other things he needs.

444
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,949
Do you know how old Paolo is? 1 5.

445
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,210
Sometimes he's like a pup
that can't think.

446
00:54:39,719 --> 00:54:42,110
loving just anyone with no reason.

447
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:49,110
l'm sure that when he was born
he was left alone too often.

448
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:52,920
he lacked the warm breath
of someone beside him.

449
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:57,280
What happened?

450
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:04,219
lt's bettter l don't answer.
l'd just lie again.

451
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:20,400
Your sandwich and orange juice.

452
00:55:27,159 --> 00:55:28,980
She forgot her book.

453
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:32,400
What'll they do to her at school?

454
00:55:34,519 --> 00:55:36,340
They'll fail her for sure.

455
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:49,440
What is it?

456
00:55:52,039 --> 00:55:53,860
He's selling newspapers.

457
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,719
- To who?
- To German passengers.

458
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,880
Has he got a bike too?

459
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,170
There are some bicycles too. see?

460
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:19,969
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

461
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:22,070
You look terrible!

462
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,820
Nothing's wrong.

463
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,679
How did that doctor go?

464
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,159
That's enough.

465
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:15,320
The last one.

466
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:21,969
Eat up. you're too skinny.

467
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,019
You have to get fat like lafrate.

468
00:57:30,639 --> 00:57:32,389
Who's lafrate?

469
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,409
A friend of mine at school.

470
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,860
How are you doing in school?

471
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,289
l've always passed my exams.

472
00:57:40,679 --> 00:57:42,849
Open. or it'll get all over you.

473
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,400
You're really good.

474
00:57:49,719 --> 00:57:51,889
Want to see something?

475
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:54,420
Give me a piece of paper and a pen.

476
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:00,260
A marker.

477
00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:04,739
A piece of paper with a pen.

478
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:10,329
One sheet.

479
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,900
l'll show you how l can write.

480
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,679
You wrote ''Gianni''?

481
00:58:30,199 --> 00:58:31,989
You wrote my name?

482
00:58:33,079 --> 00:58:34,869
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

483
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:40,380
Gianni and Paolo.

484
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,670
You owe me five euros.

485
00:58:58,679 --> 00:59:01,730
Dear Cristina.

486
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,699
Kristin., not Cristina!

487
00:59:05,159 --> 00:59:07,510
- Dear Kristin...
- With a K?

488
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,380
How are you?

489
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,559
l'm fine. thank you.

490
00:59:17,199 --> 00:59:19,269
What can l say to you?

491
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:21,469
You're very prettty.

492
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:23,630
Prettty just as you are...

493
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,719
Prettty. prettty...
Prettty with two 't's.

494
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:32,849
- Just once. right?
- No. ten times.

495
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:37,579
Numbered.
so you can see there are ten.

496
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:43,170
- That's all.
- Is that it?

497
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:47,519
l love you.

498
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,599
Full stop.

499
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,690
We'll get married and that's all!

500
00:59:53,079 --> 00:59:55,289
l love you.

501
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:57,769
Then we'll get married.

502
01:00:02,159 --> 01:00:03,699
Come visit me soon.

503
01:00:04,039 --> 01:00:06,530
- No.
- Why not?

504
01:00:08,199 --> 01:00:10,900
l have no time.
l have so many things to do.

505
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:14,690
We won't write that.

506
01:00:15,079 --> 01:00:18,800
Write.. Why don't you get glasses?

507
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:24,400
l wear them. and you don't.
because l see double.

508
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:28,780
How do you see? Single?

509
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,000
Should we write that?

510
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:35,900
- Alberto saw your picture.
- Slow down.

511
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:42,019
He said. ''Will you introduce her...
question mark.''

512
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:46,150
l told him. ''Not on your life!''

513
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:51,440
Now that's all and bye.
Full stop.

514
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:55,570
Lots of kisses
and hope to see you soon...

515
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,650
- Lots of kisses and that's all.
- No ''See you soon''?

516
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,219
Yours. Paolo.

517
01:01:04,599 --> 01:01:06,320
Full stop.

518
01:01:07,639 --> 01:01:10,409
You. full stop...

519
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:12,530
Yours. full stop.

520
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,809
Yours. Paolo... full stop.

521
01:01:15,199 --> 01:01:18,320
Yours. full stop and Paolo... full stop.

522
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,159
That's all.

523
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:37,119
You'll get tired. come sit down.

524
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,480
Don't worry.

525
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:30,599
- Do you like basketball?
- Yes...

526
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:35,039
but it's played standing up.
not in a wheelchair.

527
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:37,090
But they're doing fine.

528
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:40,519
They're good. but they're very...

529
01:02:41,079 --> 01:02:42,969
- Want to sit down?
- No.

530
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,250
Wait here. don't move.

531
01:03:03,239 --> 01:03:05,130
l brought your book back.

532
01:03:05,519 --> 01:03:07,239
l thought l'd lost it.

533
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,659
This is Nadine. my daughter.

534
01:03:12,039 --> 01:03:14,110
They've organised a kind of party.

535
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,940
She wants you to know
she did these herself.

536
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:28,150
You can have one as a gift.

537
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,539
Thank you. they're lovely.

538
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,780
See how happy she is?

539
01:04:08,519 --> 01:04:10,309
She loves to be surrounded by people.

540
01:04:10,679 --> 01:04:12,929
to be the centre of atttention.

541
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:18,139
So. will you make peace
with the doctor?

542
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,059
l'm not sure.

543
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,889
Things are somewhat more complicated.

544
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:29,590
- Where's Paolo?
- In there. watching the game.

545
01:05:03,679 --> 01:05:05,400
Will you help me get on?

546
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:10,010
He makes a return shot...
a long shot. a header...

547
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,579
A header again and he scores.

548
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,719
One to one.

549
01:07:18,679 --> 01:07:20,889
You have to mark the other player

550
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:25,250
and then shoot for the goal.

551
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,130
That's football.

552
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:35,679
Volleyball is played with your hands.

553
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:42,230
A smash. that's volleyball!

554
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:48,760
Can you play volleyball?

555
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:09,699
The sound ofthe door slamming
stayed in my head for years.

556
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,630
Doctors kept coming in.

557
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,949
Coming and going. all ofthem.

558
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:25,359
Doctors and nurses.

559
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:33,659
Giulia's mother and sister
Iooking at me from a distance.

560
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:38,689
as ifto say. ''lt's your fault.''

561
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:46,659
At one point l saw a priest.

562
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:55,069
They wanted to take him into the operating
room where Giulia was having the baby.

563
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:01,770
l yelled something at him

564
01:10:03,239 --> 01:10:05,869
and l yanked that stuff
from his hands.

565
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:10,479
the holy oil.

566
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:16,119
They grabbed me
and dragged me away.

567
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:21,390
There was an eerie silence.

568
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:27,279
Everyone had disappeared.

569
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:34,140
Then a doctor came in.

570
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:38,640
He said.

571
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:42,619
''The mother didn't make it.''

572
01:10:46,430 --> 01:10:48,220
Those were his words.

573
01:10:53,470 --> 01:10:55,470
''The baby's alive.''

574
01:10:59,319 --> 01:11:01,529
''He just has a few problems.''

575
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:05,189
They'd pulled him out
at the last minute.

576
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,180
when a caesarean
could no longer be done.

577
01:11:14,279 --> 01:11:16,310
Paolo's mother was 19.

578
01:11:21,350 --> 01:11:24,680
Who took care of him?

579
01:11:29,390 --> 01:11:31,779
l didn't even want to see him.

580
01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:42,859
l met him for the first time
three days ago.

581
01:11:52,159 --> 01:11:54,789
- What did he say?
- That everything's fine.

582
01:12:11,319 --> 01:12:13,039
What did you do?

583
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:25,680
Nothing.

584
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:43,470
His sleep is troubled.
like my daughter's.

585
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:49,029
She's never still at night.
she trembles.

586
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:57,229
We were gettting along fine.
Why did he run away?

587
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:59,960
Not even he knows that.

588
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:03,670
lt'll never happen again.

589
01:13:04,199 --> 01:13:05,920
l'll be more careful.

590
01:13:07,319 --> 01:13:09,180
He'll get lost again.

591
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:12,750
When someone like Paolo
gets lost in his darkness.

592
01:13:13,319 --> 01:13:16,649
all you can do is wait
for his return.

593
01:13:18,319 --> 01:13:20,710
What will he be like
when he's grown up?

594
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:23,510
Your son is lucky.

595
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:27,500
Did you see the others
in the hospital. like Nadine?

596
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:33,329
Paolo is lucky because
he still looks like a child.

597
01:13:36,319 --> 01:13:38,810
All of us are moved before a child.

598
01:13:40,470 --> 01:13:43,239
smile at him. give caresses.

599
01:13:46,279 --> 01:13:48,069
especially if he's ill.

600
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:50,600
Perhaps.

601
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:52,880
Even if it seems absurd.

602
01:13:53,279 --> 01:13:57,319
his illness will protect him
from the others.

603
01:13:58,390 --> 01:14:00,710
Prepare yourselffor suffering

604
01:14:02,279 --> 01:14:04,909
if you intend to be close to him.

605
01:14:19,079 --> 01:14:21,220
- Can l ask you something?
- Sure.

606
01:14:23,119 --> 01:14:24,840
How can you be so serene?

607
01:14:28,079 --> 01:14:29,829
lt took time.

608
01:14:31,470 --> 01:14:35,020
l began by thinking about
just the litttle things.

609
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:38,710
the everyday things.

610
01:14:39,159 --> 01:14:41,689
Nadine needs new pyjamas.

611
01:14:43,159 --> 01:14:45,550
the toothpaste is running out.

612
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,720
remember to put
her favourite biscuits in her milk.

613
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:54,430
lt's good to be
a litttle superficial.

614
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:57,619
it helps to survive.

615
01:15:01,239 --> 01:15:05,000
When l see someone gettting bettter

616
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:07,739
and my daughter is suffering.

617
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:09,979
l'm jealous even.

618
01:15:11,390 --> 01:15:13,140
and l'm not ashamed to admit it.

619
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:20,840
You'd bettter get back to Paolo.

620
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:27,560
Thank you.

621
01:17:03,239 --> 01:17:05,170
For over 20 years.

622
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:10,960
every single minute. my daughter
has been my only thought.

623
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:15,060
As l wash her.

624
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:18,310
as l caress her...

625
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:25,569
sometimes she looks at me
with desperate eyes.

626
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:32,109
l say to myself.

627
01:17:39,319 --> 01:17:41,069
''Why doesn't she die?''

628
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:02,489
- How are you?
- Fine.

629
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:06,710
l counted one hundred trains.

630
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:10,380
Five trains.

631
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:12,619
A red one and a yellow one.

632
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,979
That's not true. you slept.
And you even snored!

633
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:20,319
Yes. you snored.

634
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:25,710
Do we have to go to the hospital?

635
01:20:28,199 --> 01:20:30,869
- It's over?
- We won't go any more.

636
01:20:33,039 --> 01:20:35,000
And we're leaving here too.

637
01:20:39,279 --> 01:20:40,859
Want to?

638
01:20:41,199 --> 01:20:44,010
Last night l played on
the PlayStation with Dad.

639
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:49,529
- Who won?
- Me.

640
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,960
You beat him? Good for you.

641
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,890
Today l'll beat you too.

642
01:20:56,350 --> 01:20:58,310
Show me how you'll beat me.

643
01:21:03,039 --> 01:21:05,039
Do you need some cuddles?

644
01:21:05,430 --> 01:21:07,920
Are you looking for affection
when you do this?

645
01:21:08,390 --> 01:21:10,670
Stretch. like this.

646
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:14,170
Like waking up in the morning?

647
01:21:15,279 --> 01:21:17,630
Really stretch. with both arms.

648
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:28,899
He fell offthe bed!

649
01:21:48,350 --> 01:21:50,739
This time Alberto
will beat up the two of us.

650
01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:52,920
l'll defend you.

651
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:56,649
You'll get the worst of it.

652
01:22:00,159 --> 01:22:01,979
There'll be hell to pay...

653
01:22:03,390 --> 01:22:05,180
Where are we going?

654
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:08,970
To a place you've seen.
but never been.

655
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:12,359
What do you mean?

656
01:22:13,390 --> 01:22:15,319
You've seen the moon?

657
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:17,579
- Ever been there?
- Yes.

658
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:19,470
On the moon?

659
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:22,569
No. you've seen it at night.
in the sky!

660
01:22:23,079 --> 01:22:24,869
l saw it on TV.

661
01:22:28,199 --> 01:22:30,449
Have you ever driven a Bugattti?

662
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:35,310
l've seen a picture of one.

663
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:39,109
l'm taking you to a place
you've seen in pictures.

664
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:43,329
lt begins with ''N''.

665
01:22:45,430 --> 01:22:47,149
l don't know.

666
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:52,399
''N'' like No...

667
01:22:54,159 --> 01:22:55,880
- Like Nor...?
- North!

668
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:58,590
- Norwa...?
- Norway!

669
01:23:00,430 --> 01:23:02,180
Like Kristin.

670
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:05,119
- Your hand.
- l'm taking you to Kristin.

671
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:08,170
- Are you happy?
- Yes. l'm glad.

672
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:14,640
l'm happy.

673
01:23:36,350 --> 01:23:38,279
What are you looking at?

674
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:40,399
The sea.

675
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:44,399
Beautiful., isn't it?

676
01:23:59,319 --> 01:24:02,649
l'll put gel in my hair.
Good idea. right?

677
01:24:08,079 --> 01:24:09,869
My red T-shirt

678
01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:13,220
or the one with ''nothing on it''
writtten on it?

679
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:15,340
Whichever you like.

680
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:18,170
Which one would Kristin like best?

681
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:20,500
l don't know.

682
01:24:22,279 --> 01:24:24,069
Then l'll wear them both.

683
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:32,239
My shoes are OK.

684
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:36,960
They cost a lot
because ofthe insoles.

685
01:24:38,319 --> 01:24:41,939
They're not normal shoes.
like other kids have.

686
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:45,119
- They're really nice.
- Very nice.

687
01:24:52,390 --> 01:24:54,279
l can't take this.

688
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:55,840
Why not?

689
01:24:57,560 --> 01:24:59,310
The rubber is worn down.

690
01:25:02,239 --> 01:25:04,560
l might slip in front of Kristin.

691
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:08,050
What a laugh she'd have!

692
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:10,539
Know what we'll do?

693
01:25:12,350 --> 01:25:14,029
Want to see?

694
01:25:14,390 --> 01:25:16,640
- Are you ready?
- Go!

695
01:25:17,079 --> 01:25:18,659
We'll throw it?

696
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,069
lnto the sea?

697
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:26,399
You're really nuts!

698
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:28,479
Look.

699
01:25:40,279 --> 01:25:42,000
You're nuts!

700
01:25:44,199 --> 01:25:47,920
- What'll l do now?
- l'll help you.

701
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,449
You'll buy me another one.

702
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:28,729
The diary.

703
01:26:29,119 --> 01:26:30,840
The cake.

704
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,760
l'll close it. like always?

705
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:51,640
- Why are they shooting?
- They're playing.

706
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,859
For real or pretend?

707
01:26:55,239 --> 01:26:57,489
lt's a sport they do around here.

708
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:00,409
- With a gun?
- Yes. it's called biathlon.

709
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:02,600
Biathlon?

710
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:06,939
l'll go see when Kristin gets out.

711
01:27:50,039 --> 01:27:53,270
- What do we do now?
- Nothing.

712
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:56,890
Today's Sunday. the school's closed.

713
01:27:57,439 --> 01:28:00,140
Right. it's a holiday.

714
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:03,800
We won't see Kristin any more?

715
01:28:04,359 --> 01:28:06,319
She'll be here tomorrow.

716
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:08,539
She has a test.

717
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:13,130
- Do you want to come back tomorrow?
- She always gets As...

718
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:17,350
in the important subjects...

719
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:19,680
She gets As?

720
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:23,829
You should see how she writes.
how she reads.

721
01:28:24,359 --> 01:28:26,850
how she does dictation...

722
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:29,739
