1
00:01:07,245 --> 00:01:09,957
Should we go shopping?

2
00:01:48,616 --> 00:01:49,715
Azim, please.

3
00:07:13,961 --> 00:07:15,533
Who the fuck's that?

4
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,748
Maybe somebody sent your dad a hooker for Christmas

5
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:35,799
Move!

6
00:07:36,827 --> 00:07:37,287
See you.

7
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,428
Goodbye, Anna.

8
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:48,375
Calm down.

9
00:16:21,466 --> 00:16:22,567
Be calm.

10
00:16:23,727 --> 00:16:25,408
Slowly

11
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,002
Come on.

12
00:17:42,072 --> 00:17:43,231
Pederast!

13
00:19:14,349 --> 00:19:16,088
You too.

14
00:19:59,113 --> 00:20:00,504
Wait...

15
00:20:07,055 --> 00:20:10,997
This is the best spot to get rid of a corpse.

16
00:20:11,287 --> 00:20:12,156
Let's go.

17
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:14,939
One...

18
00:20:15,403 --> 00:20:16,736
Two...

19
00:20:17,142 --> 00:20:17,895
Three...

20
00:22:49,187 --> 00:22:51,100
Come on, Kirill

21
00:22:51,285 --> 00:22:52,444
Get Out.

22
00:22:57,314 --> 00:22:58,821
Get up, Kirill

23
00:22:58,937 --> 00:23:00,212
We're partners now, man.

24
00:23:00,328 --> 00:23:01,951
Yeah, yeah.

25
00:23:02,067 --> 00:23:02,995
You know?

26
00:24:04,327 --> 00:24:08,037
I think he's had enough.

27
00:25:34,273 --> 00:25:36,186
Allow me.

28
00:32:26,227 --> 00:32:30,227
That's an order.

29
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:43,218
What's the matter with you?

30
00:32:55,044 --> 00:32:57,131
That's enough, Kirill.

31
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,493
Enough?

32
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:01,884
Siberian ox...

33
00:33:26,019 --> 00:33:27,236
Psycho.

34
00:33:31,062 --> 00:33:33,323
So, which one is it going to be?

35
00:34:26,192 --> 00:34:28,627
Thank you, brother.

36
00:35:25,149 --> 00:35:27,583
What's your last name?

37
00:35:30,018 --> 00:35:32,801
Tell me your last name

38
00:35:33,785 --> 00:35:35,871
Kirilenko

39
00:35:36,741 --> 00:35:38,654
Where are you from?

40
00:35:39,524 --> 00:35:41,437
Ukraine

41
00:35:43,002 --> 00:35:45,958
Which village? Which town?

42
00:35:47,176 --> 00:35:48,393
Irpen

43
00:35:49,263 --> 00:35:51,002
Outside kiev

44
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:05,089
Stay alive a little longer.

45
00:36:09,958 --> 00:36:11,698
Understand?

46
00:40:36,013 --> 00:40:40,187
I dealt with the <i>vory v zakone</i> when
I worked for the KGB

47
00:40:44,234 --> 00:40:45,915
I was an auxiliary!

48
00:43:22,223 --> 00:43:23,672
What are you saying?

49
00:43:23,788 --> 00:43:25,701
Azim's nephew slit Soyka's throat

50
00:43:26,513 --> 00:43:28,252
Kirill paid him to do it.

51
00:43:29,237 --> 00:43:30,687
Shut your fucking mouth!

52
00:43:31,034 --> 00:43:32,716
Your dad always knows the truth.

53
00:44:38,511 --> 00:44:40,424
Kirill did the right thing.

54
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:44,888
He did a good thing for our people.
They will appreciate that.

55
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:29,699
Ok, ok.

56
00:46:32,046 --> 00:46:35,698
When I was in the KGB,
we knew how to deal with scum like you.

57
00:46:36,046 --> 00:46:37,959
And you did what there?

58
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:47,610
Calm down.

59
00:48:09,582 --> 00:48:11,089
Devil!

60
00:48:12,596 --> 00:48:14,219
Motherfucker!

61
00:49:39,917 --> 00:49:41,308
It was nothing important.

62
00:50:34,076 --> 00:50:36,858
My only son.

63
00:51:31,401 --> 00:51:32,966
I met him.

64
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:41,778
Yes, yes.

65
00:51:55,029 --> 00:51:56,826
Do you understand me?

66
00:51:58,101 --> 00:51:58,623
Yes.

67
00:55:36,183 --> 00:55:38,676
For my brother...

68
01:00:30,774 --> 01:00:31,933
Nikolai, come on

69
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:45,338
What's she talking about?

70
01:00:45,339 --> 01:00:46,555
I didn't catch it

71
01:00:53,975 --> 01:00:55,309
What did she say?

72
01:00:56,004 --> 01:00:56,932
I don't know.

73
01:01:08,591 --> 01:01:09,693
Shut up, bitch!

74
01:01:09,694 --> 01:01:10,562
Fuck her, Kirill!

75
01:01:11,664 --> 01:01:12,437
Forget her

76
01:01:29,878 --> 01:01:30,786
That's an order!

77
01:02:08,844 --> 01:02:09,771
I don't know

78
01:02:09,772 --> 01:02:10,569
I don't know either

79
01:02:20,689 --> 01:02:22,660
She is one hundred years old.

80
01:03:30,553 --> 01:03:31,423
Yes

81
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:39,133
It's time you joined us.

82
01:03:43,076 --> 01:03:44,815
Thank you...

83
01:03:44,816 --> 01:03:45,685
Papa.

84
01:03:46,555 --> 01:03:50,323
<i>You, my dear friend...</i>

85
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,323
<i>... don't think ill of me.</i>

86
01:03:57,801 --> 01:04:01,801
<i>In this wilderness...</i>

87
01:04:02,902 --> 01:04:07,134
<i>... simply bury me.</i>

88
01:04:20,002 --> 01:04:23,132
My dad swapped a little girl from Georgia for this shit.

89
01:04:39,162 --> 01:04:41,713
Let's drink to the little Georgian girl.

90
01:06:23,584 --> 01:06:25,149
Yes, yes Kirill.

91
01:06:27,526 --> 01:06:28,453
Hey...

92
01:06:32,453 --> 01:06:33,787
I am a vor by birth.

93
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:38,366
I know.

94
01:06:41,091 --> 01:06:42,366
Don't you forget it

95
01:07:31,361 --> 01:07:32,579
Beautiful building..

96
01:07:36,675 --> 01:07:37,236
Good evening

97
01:07:37,237 --> 01:07:38,530
Good evening

98
01:07:42,945 --> 01:07:44,877
Is everything alright?

99
01:07:44,993 --> 01:07:46,672
Yes, everything's fine.

100
01:07:55,816 --> 01:07:59,320
We can see that you were in prison in Siberia...

101
01:08:00,805 --> 01:08:01,965
...and that you were a thief.

102
01:08:04,206 --> 01:08:06,718
My father was a government worker.

103
01:08:06,719 --> 01:08:09,372
He fixed the cars of officials.

104
01:08:09,373 --> 01:08:13,218
I began by selling the spare parts
when I was fifteen.

105
01:08:15,575 --> 01:08:17,256
You have no forced tattoos?

106
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:18,686
None.

107
01:08:19,865 --> 01:08:21,565
You were not cooperative?

108
01:08:24,116 --> 01:08:25,623
I spent two years in the punishment block.

109
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:29,738
You went through the Crosses in St. Petersburg?

110
01:08:30,546 --> 01:08:32,381
I was in solitary confinement a dozen times.

111
01:08:32,382 --> 01:08:34,287
I was called "The Stump" because
they couldn't shaft me.

112
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:40,858
Your father was a bitch and a weak fucker
for working for the Government.

113
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:42,133
Right?

114
01:08:45,225 --> 01:08:45,920
That's right.

115
01:08:47,076 --> 01:08:48,312
He means nothing to me.

116
01:08:49,336 --> 01:08:49,934
My mother...

117
01:08:49,935 --> 01:08:50,979
You have no mother.

118
01:08:51,752 --> 01:08:53,491
She was a whore anyway.

119
01:08:57,329 --> 01:08:57,754
Yes.

120
01:09:04,928 --> 01:09:07,768
I have no mother and no father...

121
01:09:07,769 --> 01:09:11,652
There is only the code,
The vory v zakone...

122
01:09:11,653 --> 01:09:14,609
... which I have always followed

123
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:19,826
That is why there is an empty space
above your heart...

124
01:09:19,827 --> 01:09:22,435
... where the stars will go.

125
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:28,174
And an empty space
on your knees.

126
01:09:29,337 --> 01:09:31,366
I am dead already

127
01:09:31,367 --> 01:09:33,627
I died when I was fifteen

128
01:09:33,628 --> 01:09:36,409
Now I live in the zone all the time

129
01:13:53,214 --> 01:13:56,344
Kirill is in there...

130
01:13:56,345 --> 01:13:58,953
... there, there..

131
01:15:07,296 --> 01:15:08,339
Are you ok?

132
01:15:08,919 --> 01:15:10,137
Finish him off.

133
01:20:11,865 --> 01:20:14,509
You didn't come here to give me flowers...

134
01:20:34,016 --> 01:20:35,987
You have gone beyond what was agreed.

135
01:21:58,652 --> 01:22:00,218
What are you looking at, baby?

136
01:22:00,855 --> 01:22:01,609
You..

137
01:25:44,382 --> 01:25:45,773
Sorry.

138
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:50,751
You're either with him or with me...

139
01:27:09,386 --> 01:27:13,502
With him... or with me...

140
01:27:24,169 --> 01:27:26,082
I know, Kirill...

141
01:27:30,546 --> 01:27:32,632
Give her to me...

142
01:27:47,749 --> 01:27:49,431
Your father's going away.

143
01:27:49,432 --> 01:27:53,257
The family business will be yours.
It's our time.

144
01:28:15,671 --> 01:28:16,351
Let's go

145
01:28:17,732 --> 01:28:18,543
Come on!

146
01:28:19,548 --> 01:28:20,920
That's an order!

147
01:28:51,174 --> 01:28:52,855
Bless you.

148
01:29:21,329 --> 01:29:24,921
Goodbye, Anna Ivanovna.

149
01:30:22,100 --> 01:30:26,622
My little russian doll...

150
01:30:47,144 --> 01:30:49,057
My muffin.
