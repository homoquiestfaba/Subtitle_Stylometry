[puppy whimpering]

00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:52,362
- Naughty baby, whatever will you about?

5
00:00:53,432 --> 00:00:56,125
What if everyone should
run away from home?

6
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:58,299
Why, there would be no more home at all.

7
00:00:58,334 --> 00:01:01,164
And then what should
your mommy do but cry?

8
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,028
You don't want your mommy to cry.

9
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,616
Do you?
- Elizabeth?

10
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:05,996
Elizabeth, we're leaving.

11
00:01:06,031 --> 00:01:07,619
We're leaving now.

12
00:01:08,378 --> 00:01:10,691
- Come back, you naughty baby.

13
00:01:12,382 --> 00:01:15,351
- Oh yes, and if it were up to
you, we'd accomplish nothing.

14
00:01:15,385 --> 00:01:18,802
- Sarah, no one doubts
your drive for a moment.

15
00:01:18,837 --> 00:01:20,149
- Elizabeth.

16
00:01:20,183 --> 00:01:23,152
Elizabeth Taylor, are you
deliberately being naughty?

17
00:01:23,186 --> 00:01:24,670
- I merely question if it's natural

18
00:01:24,705 --> 00:01:26,224
to put a child out to work.

19
00:01:26,258 --> 00:01:27,777
- Oh, and you're such an expert

20
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:29,848
on the natural order, Francis?

21
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:33,541
Besides, I'm hardly sending
her off to the coal mines.

22
00:01:33,576 --> 00:01:36,303
To have a chance to be more than an--

23
00:01:36,337 --> 00:01:37,787
- Art dealer's wife?

24
00:01:37,821 --> 00:01:41,791
- Oh my, we're full of canny
wisdom this morning, aren't we?

25
00:01:41,825 --> 00:01:43,310
Get the bloody dogs.

26
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,797
Elizabeth, tell Daddy
this is what you want.

27
00:01:47,831 --> 00:01:50,386
Tell him Mommy isn't
forcing you to do anything.

28
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,872
Tell him you have always
dreamed of being a movie star.

29
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:55,632
- But I haven't.

30
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:56,530
- What?

31
00:01:59,326 --> 00:02:01,155
Is this your doing?

32
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,261
- Bye, bye Elizabeth.

33
00:02:03,295 --> 00:02:04,296
- Bye, Daddy.

34
00:02:04,331 --> 00:02:06,781
I want to be an actress.

35
00:02:06,816 --> 00:02:09,922
Actresses can make
people believe anything.

36
00:02:09,957 --> 00:02:12,166
- Yes, well, actresses go hungry.

37
00:02:12,201 --> 00:02:14,720
I know, I saw enough of them when I tried

38
00:02:14,755 --> 00:02:16,550
for a career in the theater.

39
00:02:16,584 --> 00:02:17,551
Here you go.

40
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:19,553
Hop in.

41
00:02:23,971 --> 00:02:26,698
But movie stars have everything.

42
00:02:31,392 --> 00:02:35,707
All right now, we mustn't
keep Aunt Hedda waiting.

43
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,573
- Is Miss Hedda really my aunt, Mommy?

44
00:02:40,884 --> 00:02:45,372
- Hedda Hopper may well turn
out to be our fairy godmother.

Perhaps if she had some accompaniment.

51
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:00,110
- I can't play.

52
00:03:00,145 --> 00:03:01,698
Perhaps you?

And Sarah, she is a lovely child, but...

57
00:03:12,571 --> 00:03:16,437
Elizabeth, the would is full
of things for you to do.

58
00:03:16,472 --> 00:03:19,233
You can marry, teach, be a nurse.

59
00:03:19,268 --> 00:03:23,099
You don't have to be an actress, you know.

60
00:03:23,133 --> 00:03:24,583
Not to be happy.

61
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,283
- Aren't you a love?

62
00:03:34,317 --> 00:03:37,286
Aren't you Mummy's precious love.

63
00:03:38,045 --> 00:03:39,011
You're so pretty.

64
00:03:39,046 --> 00:03:40,806
- You know, Sarah.

65
00:03:40,841 --> 00:03:44,707
I might just have a
rabbit or two in my hat.

66
00:03:53,163 --> 00:03:55,235
- Okay Hedda, what'd I do wrong?

67
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:58,307
- [laughing] Well don't
be such a goose, Sam.

68
00:03:58,341 --> 00:04:00,964
Oh, I do hope I'm interrupting.

69
00:04:00,999 --> 00:04:02,276
- You are.

70
00:04:02,311 --> 00:04:05,037
We're just about to cast
the little girl for Lassie.

71
00:04:05,072 --> 00:04:07,247
Stick around, you're gonna
have a scoop for your column.

72
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:08,455
- Oh really?

73
00:04:10,353 --> 00:04:14,530
Well, Sam, you are about
to make a huge mistake.

74
00:04:15,841 --> 00:04:18,396
- None of them are above four feet, Hedda,

75
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,638
it can't be that huge.

76
00:04:19,673 --> 00:04:22,676
- Well, if you had read
my column recently,

77
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,300
you would know that
very dear family friends

78
00:04:26,335 --> 00:04:28,475
have just arrived from London,

79
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:31,374
moments ahead of the blitz, as it were.

80
00:04:31,409 --> 00:04:34,584
- I'm sorry Hedda, we pretty
much made our decision.

81
00:04:34,619 --> 00:04:37,449
- Huh, you think you have.

82
00:04:37,484 --> 00:04:39,209
Elizabeth, Sam Marks,

83
00:04:39,244 --> 00:04:42,972
permit me to present,
Miss Elizabeth Taylor.

84
00:04:47,494 --> 00:04:50,531
- [chuckling] I know all
about this little lady.

85
00:04:50,566 --> 00:04:53,534
Her father Francis and I were
air raid wardens together.

86
00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:56,261
He told me his wife was dying
to see her in the movies,

87
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,022
I told him I'd try and take a look at her.

88
00:04:59,057 --> 00:05:00,748
Elizabeth.

89
00:05:00,783 --> 00:05:01,646
- Yes sir?

90
00:05:03,441 --> 00:05:06,375
- Elizabeth, do you think you can act?

91
00:05:06,409 --> 00:05:07,893
- I have, many times.

92
00:05:07,928 --> 00:05:09,170
- Where was that?

93
00:05:09,205 --> 00:05:11,000
- A bit at Universal.

94
00:05:11,034 --> 00:05:13,036
There's One Born Every Minute?

95
00:05:13,071 --> 00:05:13,761
You must have seen it.

96
00:05:13,796 --> 00:05:14,866
- I don't think so.

97
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,318
Elizabeth, do you think
you could talk to a dog

98
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:21,666
and make us believe you believe it?

99
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,599
- Could you wait a moment?

100
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:24,496
- Sure.

101
00:05:38,614 --> 00:05:40,270
- I know you love me, Lassie,

102
00:05:40,305 --> 00:05:42,963
because no matter how far away you go,

103
00:05:42,997 --> 00:05:45,206
you'll always come back.

104
00:05:45,241 --> 00:05:46,207
You know why?

105
00:05:46,242 --> 00:05:48,002
Because you love me.

106
00:05:48,037 --> 00:05:51,316
You don't want your Mummy to cry.

107
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,181
Do you know a secret, Lassie?

108
00:05:54,215 --> 00:05:57,115
If everyone ran away from home,

109
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:59,600
there would be no more home.

110
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:05,192
- Hedda.

111
00:06:05,226 --> 00:06:06,089
I owe you.

112
00:06:07,056 --> 00:06:07,919
- Uh huh.

113
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:18,032
- Of all time, the
original Lassie stars in,

114
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:19,586
Lassie Come Home.

115
00:06:21,104 --> 00:06:23,383
You must see the original Lassie

116
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:27,387
in her greatest movie
role, Lassie Come Home.

117
00:06:28,595 --> 00:06:31,183
Introducing, Elizabeth Taylor.

118
00:06:33,254 --> 00:06:36,292
- Darling girl, you got wonderful reviews

119
00:06:36,326 --> 00:06:37,811
for your work in Lassie.

120
00:06:37,845 --> 00:06:40,469
I wrote one myself, remember?

121
00:06:40,503 --> 00:06:43,126
Why not rest a bit on your laurels?

122
00:06:43,161 --> 00:06:46,233
- But Aunt Hedda, it
truly is my favorite book.

123
00:06:46,267 --> 00:06:49,374
- Elizabeth, I think Mr. Mayer knows best.

124
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,341
Besides, your plate is quite full

125
00:06:51,376 --> 00:06:53,067
with White Cliffs of Dover.

126
00:06:53,102 --> 00:06:54,552
Your time will come, dear.

127
00:06:54,586 --> 00:06:57,209
It has to, with Lassie
such a huge success.

128
00:06:57,244 --> 00:06:58,245
- It isn't fair.

129
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:00,454
I was born to play Velvet Brown.

130
00:07:00,489 --> 00:07:01,593
I ride.

131
00:07:01,628 --> 00:07:02,456
I ride like a--

132
00:07:02,491 --> 00:07:03,906
- Listen to me, Elizabeth.

133
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,116
You could turn yourself
into a flying horse

134
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:11,051
and they still won't
give you National Velvet.

135
00:07:11,948 --> 00:07:15,849
They're looking for someone more mature.

136
00:07:15,883 --> 00:07:16,677
- Taller?

137
00:07:16,712 --> 00:07:19,024
- Well, taller, yes.

138
00:07:19,059 --> 00:07:21,441
But someone more developed.

139
00:07:22,165 --> 00:07:23,097
- You mean?

140
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:28,758
- Uh, we'll stick with taller.

141
00:07:30,657 --> 00:07:33,798
[sentimental music]

142
00:07:58,201 --> 00:08:01,204
- National Velvet, scene 28, take 2.

143
00:08:11,214 --> 00:08:13,078
- Heels down, Elizabeth, heels down!

144
00:08:13,113 --> 00:08:16,047
- What a determined
young lady, Miss Taylor.

145
00:08:16,081 --> 00:08:20,500
Elizabeth has really
blossomed into Velvet Brown.

146
00:08:29,854 --> 00:08:30,786
[cries out]

147
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,995
- Elizabeth!
- Cut!

148
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:34,272
- Let's go, come on!

149
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:35,376
- Are you all right?

150
00:08:35,411 --> 00:08:36,723
Is it your back?

151
00:08:36,757 --> 00:08:39,035
Get an ambulance, she's hurt her back!

152
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,934
- No no, don't do that.

153
00:08:40,968 --> 00:08:41,935
I'm fine.

154
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:43,108
Smashing.

155
00:08:43,143 --> 00:08:46,387
I ought to know to have kept
my heels down a bit more.

156
00:08:46,422 --> 00:08:49,598
- That was quite a tumble, kiddo.

157
00:08:49,632 --> 00:08:51,013
Let's call it a day.

158
00:08:51,047 --> 00:08:52,048
- No no, don't.

159
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:52,739
I'll be fine.

160
00:08:52,773 --> 00:08:55,051
Just let me catch my breath.

161
00:08:55,086 --> 00:08:56,087
- You sure?

162
00:08:56,121 --> 00:08:56,984
- Yeah.

163
00:08:58,503 --> 00:08:59,953
- Darling.

164
00:08:59,987 --> 00:09:03,819
I know you think I push
too much, too hard,

165
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:05,786
but even I don't expect.

166
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:06,960
- Mummy.

167
00:09:06,994 --> 00:09:09,859
I know that at first I didn't
want to be a movie star,

168
00:09:09,894 --> 00:09:12,621
but now, now if I couldn't be in films,

169
00:09:12,655 --> 00:09:15,831
I'd feel like a tree that fell down.

170
00:09:16,728 --> 00:09:19,075
A tree without roots.

171
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,698
Isn't he wondrous?

172
00:09:24,253 --> 00:09:26,669
I loved him at first sight.

173
00:09:26,704 --> 00:09:31,191
Do you think they'd give
him to me after the film?

174
00:09:31,225 --> 00:09:32,951
- Darling, after this film,

175
00:09:32,986 --> 00:09:36,092
I imagine they'd give you anything.

176
00:09:38,025 --> 00:09:41,788
- A sweeping saga of love,
tenderness and courage.

177
00:09:41,822 --> 00:09:44,894
You'll thrill to the new screen sensation,

178
00:09:44,929 --> 00:09:48,449
Elizabeth Taylor, as she
steals your heart in,

179
00:09:48,484 --> 00:09:52,799
National Velvet.
[dramatic music]

180
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:11,576
- Bye, darling.

181
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,888
- Janie?

182
00:10:12,922 --> 00:10:15,856
Why don't you continue with
your essay on Wordsworth

183
00:10:15,891 --> 00:10:17,962
that you started last week.

184
00:10:17,996 --> 00:10:19,273
Dickie, Darrell.

185
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,035
- More like last month.

186
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:25,555
I've been writing the same
essay through my last two films.

187
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,487
- Oh, children!

188
00:10:26,522 --> 00:10:27,419
I'm afraid you'll have to forgo

189
00:10:27,454 --> 00:10:28,904
your science test until tomorrow.

190
00:10:28,938 --> 00:10:31,251
Mr. Strickland of
publicity wants to come in

191
00:10:31,285 --> 00:10:34,599
and make a few suggestions
before you meet with photo play.

192
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,565
- Night shoot?

193
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,946
- Three in a row.

194
00:10:36,981 --> 00:10:39,811
Been up at the bloody crack
of dawn to study my lines.

195
00:10:39,846 --> 00:10:41,226
- It's worth it, though.

196
00:10:41,261 --> 00:10:45,161
Everyone says National
Velvet will make you a star.

197
00:10:45,196 --> 00:10:46,991
- I'm already a star.

198
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,652
- Three, two.
[bright music]

199
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:54,343
- This is Hedda Hopper.

200
00:10:54,377 --> 00:10:56,759
And this is Hollywood.

201
00:10:56,794 --> 00:10:59,831
Elizabeth Taylor is in New
York to be photographed

202
00:10:59,866 --> 00:11:02,834
for her 17th birthday
spread in Life Magazine

203
00:11:02,869 --> 00:11:04,456
by Felipe Hoffman.

204
00:11:06,735 --> 00:11:07,805
- It's rather scary.

205
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,014
I mean, Life Magazine.

206
00:11:10,048 --> 00:11:13,224
- It's your birthday spread in Life.

207
00:11:18,816 --> 00:11:20,887
I think it's time the studio realized

208
00:11:20,921 --> 00:11:24,166
that their baby girl is all grown up.

209
00:11:25,926 --> 00:11:26,996
- At 17?

210
00:11:27,031 --> 00:11:27,894
- 17?

211
00:11:28,757 --> 00:11:29,792
Famous.

212
00:11:32,415 --> 00:11:34,383
You're uncomfortable?

213
00:11:34,417 --> 00:11:35,280
- No.

214
00:11:38,387 --> 00:11:39,526
Maybe.

215
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,872
- Know why?

216
00:11:40,907 --> 00:11:44,427
Because I am focusing on your whole body.

217
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:50,710
It is a woman's body.

218
00:11:53,436 --> 00:11:54,299
Stunning.

219
00:11:55,611 --> 00:11:57,440
Like a woman.

220
00:11:57,475 --> 00:11:59,097
Free, like a woman.

221
00:11:59,132 --> 00:11:59,995
Sensuous.

222
00:12:01,272 --> 00:12:02,825
- I don't know.

223
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,793
Inside I still feel like a girl.

224
00:12:04,827 --> 00:12:06,829
- But you're not a little girl.

225
00:12:06,864 --> 00:12:09,142
You are a woman.

226
00:12:09,176 --> 00:12:10,039
Yes, yes.

227
00:12:12,904 --> 00:12:13,767
You have bosoms.

228
00:12:13,802 --> 00:12:15,389
So stick them out!

229
00:12:16,494 --> 00:12:19,290
[romantic music]

230
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:33,718
- Well.

231
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,617
There's your Mr. Montgomery Clift.

232
00:12:36,652 --> 00:12:39,517
- He's beautiful, isn't he, Mummy?

233
00:12:41,622 --> 00:12:43,003
- Go say hello.

234
00:13:00,641 --> 00:13:01,504
- Coffee?

235
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,444
Don't do that.

236
00:13:10,479 --> 00:13:11,756
- Do what?

237
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,102
- Stare at me.

238
00:13:13,447 --> 00:13:14,448
- Oh.

239
00:13:14,483 --> 00:13:17,210
Me too, I'm so tired
of people staring at me

240
00:13:17,244 --> 00:13:19,281
and telling me I'm beautiful.

241
00:13:19,315 --> 00:13:19,971
I hate it.

242
00:13:20,006 --> 00:13:21,628
- Well you are beautiful.

243
00:13:21,662 --> 00:13:23,492
And it says so right here.

244
00:13:23,526 --> 00:13:24,700
And I'm beautiful.

245
00:13:24,734 --> 00:13:28,152
This is the movies, even the
ugly people are beautiful.

246
00:13:28,186 --> 00:13:29,049
So what?

247
00:13:30,533 --> 00:13:32,432
- I'm Elizabeth Taylor.

248
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:40,371
- Monty Clift, how do you do?

249
00:13:42,787 --> 00:13:47,136
Listen, you know what
the word is around here?

250
00:13:47,171 --> 00:13:49,898
You're the girl on the candy box cover.

251
00:13:49,932 --> 00:13:51,382
Is that what you want?

252
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,004
To be a thing?

253
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:55,558
Because I have to be honest
with you, Bessie Mae.

254
00:13:55,593 --> 00:13:58,216
I don't do my best work
against a mannequin.

255
00:13:58,251 --> 00:14:00,598
- Well then you'd better help
me, mister method acting,

256
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:05,637
because I've done my finest
work opposite a horse and a dog.

257
00:14:05,672 --> 00:14:07,570
[barking]

258
00:14:07,605 --> 00:14:10,608
[laughing] Stop it!

259
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:12,472
- Uh oh.

260
00:14:12,506 --> 00:14:13,335
Oh, dear.

261
00:14:13,369 --> 00:14:14,060
- What's wrong?

262
00:14:14,094 --> 00:14:15,613
Are you all right?

263
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:16,717
- Dog biscuits.

264
00:14:16,752 --> 00:14:18,547
For the shakes.

265
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:20,066
Great method actor, huh?

266
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,827
Still getting stage fright.

267
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:23,932
- Pain pills.

268
00:14:23,966 --> 00:14:25,105
For my back.

269
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:28,143
Came courtesy of National Velvet.

270
00:14:28,177 --> 00:14:31,215
- Oh, we're a sorry pair, Bessie Mae.

271
00:14:31,249 --> 00:14:32,319
A sorry pair.

272
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:34,804
- Bessie Mae.

273
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:37,117
[laughing]

274
00:14:37,152 --> 00:14:39,188
Monty look at you, you're so thin.

275
00:14:39,223 --> 00:14:41,087
Come, let's eat something.

276
00:14:41,121 --> 00:14:42,571
- Oh dammit, I'm not hungry.

277
00:14:42,605 --> 00:14:46,299
- Oh come on, you look as if
you never eat, and you have to.

278
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,921
You can't live on.

279
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,131
Go on then, do it for me.

280
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:54,100
Do it for Mama.

281
00:14:55,722 --> 00:14:57,103
Do it for Mama.

282
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:06,112
[laughing]

283
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:14,948
- Oh, good grief, I got the
same hand I got last time.

284
00:15:14,983 --> 00:15:15,949
- I bet a dime.

285
00:15:15,984 --> 00:15:17,019
- Me too.

286
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:20,126
- Come on, Elizabeth.

287
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,922
- Rewrites for the next scene.

288
00:15:27,098 --> 00:15:31,516
- Excuse me George, but
what the hell is this?

289
00:15:31,551 --> 00:15:33,415
This is, this is ridiculous!

290
00:15:33,449 --> 00:15:37,695
No young lady would speak
this way to the man she loves.

291
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:38,661
- She will.

292
00:15:39,835 --> 00:15:41,043
- Potato face.

293
00:15:41,078 --> 00:15:45,254
- Elizabeth, will you pay
attention to the game.

294
00:15:46,221 --> 00:15:49,983
[sweeping romantic music]

295
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,679
- I'm the happiest person in the world.

296
00:15:56,714 --> 00:15:58,129
- Second happiest.

297
00:15:58,164 --> 00:16:01,546
- Oh Angela, if only I could
tell you how much I love you.

298
00:16:01,581 --> 00:16:03,031
If only I could tell all.

299
00:16:03,065 --> 00:16:04,170
- Tell 'em.

300
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,206
Tell 'em all.

301
00:16:22,326 --> 00:16:23,258
- And, cut.

302
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,227
Print.
[bell ringing]

303
00:16:38,859 --> 00:16:40,240
I was right, wasn't I?

304
00:16:40,275 --> 00:16:42,208
About that new line.

305
00:16:42,242 --> 00:16:43,588
- Don't be ridiculous.

306
00:16:43,623 --> 00:16:47,765
No woman wants to be Mama
to the many she loves.

307
00:17:02,745 --> 00:17:05,334
[dog barking]

308
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,449
- Why don't you take the day off work?

309
00:17:16,483 --> 00:17:21,074
We could drive down to
the beach or something.

310
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:23,697
- Knock knock, I come bearing gifts!

311
00:17:23,732 --> 00:17:25,527
- Well hello Bessie Mae!

312
00:17:25,561 --> 00:17:26,838
What a lifesaver.

313
00:17:26,873 --> 00:17:28,081
Uh, give me a minute Billy

314
00:17:28,116 --> 00:17:30,118
and we'll go for our little drive, okay?

315
00:17:30,152 --> 00:17:32,706
- Right, I'll see you later.

316
00:17:32,741 --> 00:17:34,536
- I'm sorry, I'm interrupting.

317
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,365
- No no no, no no no.

318
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,128
Now you hate me.

319
00:17:40,162 --> 00:17:41,094
- Hate you?

320
00:17:41,129 --> 00:17:43,372
My God Monty, I love you.

321
00:17:45,512 --> 00:17:46,824
- I know.

322
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:47,721
I know.

323
00:17:48,998 --> 00:17:50,931
- I have since that first day

324
00:17:50,966 --> 00:17:53,624
when you refused to speak to my breasts.

325
00:17:53,658 --> 00:17:58,042
- Well Bessie Mae, let me
now address your breasts.

326
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,286
- [laughing] Stop it.

327
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,736
- Don't give me so much credit.

328
00:18:02,771 --> 00:18:04,152
- Oh, damn you.

329
00:18:04,186 --> 00:18:05,808
You've broken my heart.

330
00:18:05,843 --> 00:18:06,671
- I know.

331
00:18:06,706 --> 00:18:08,777
Hell, I've broken my own.

332
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,472
You're the girl, Bessie Mae.

333
00:18:14,507 --> 00:18:18,821
If anyone could have lured me
away from my wicked loving.

334
00:18:21,652 --> 00:18:23,240
- It doesn't matter.

335
00:18:23,274 --> 00:18:27,451
Whatever happens, I will
always be here for you.

336
00:18:33,836 --> 00:18:36,632
Mama will always be here for you.

337
00:18:40,636 --> 00:18:43,639
[bright jazz music]

338
00:18:57,481 --> 00:19:00,208
- Aren't you ever gonna dance?

339
00:19:00,242 --> 00:19:01,209
- I suppose.

340
00:19:01,243 --> 00:19:02,900
- It's Monty, right?

341
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:04,212
- Oh, that is so silly,

342
00:19:04,246 --> 00:19:06,559
just because I want to be
alone with my thoughts.

343
00:19:06,593 --> 00:19:09,424
- You are still in love with that guy.

344
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:12,254
- Monty and I have great
respect for each other.

345
00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:14,670
He understands the nature of me.

346
00:19:14,705 --> 00:19:16,155
- Excuse me?

347
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:18,053
Ever since A Place In The Sun,

348
00:19:18,087 --> 00:19:20,918
you have become queen of the world.

349
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:24,266
- You know, Debbie, it's like
your souls meet somewhere else

350
00:19:24,301 --> 00:19:25,509
and they come here.

351
00:19:25,543 --> 00:19:27,442
And if they don't meet again,

352
00:19:27,476 --> 00:19:31,756
then you spend your whole life
like a wanderer, searching.

353
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:32,999
- Jeepers.

354
00:19:33,033 --> 00:19:34,242
- Jeepers?

355
00:19:34,276 --> 00:19:36,520
I tell you something as
deeply moving as that,

356
00:19:36,554 --> 00:19:39,385
and you answer me like a teenager!

357
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:40,972
- I am a teenager!

358
00:19:41,007 --> 00:19:42,560
And so are you.

359
00:19:42,595 --> 00:19:46,288
- [sighs] Will no one
treat me like a grownup?

360
00:19:46,323 --> 00:19:48,014
- Well that handsome hunk over there

361
00:19:48,048 --> 00:19:51,362
seems to think you've grown up enough.

362
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,055
- Who is that?

363
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:55,953
- Nicky Hilton.

364
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:57,126
- Who?

365
00:19:57,161 --> 00:19:58,852
- His parents only own
the Waldorf Astoria,

366
00:19:58,887 --> 00:20:01,061
and about a hundred other hotels.

367
00:20:01,096 --> 00:20:01,959
- Hmm.

368
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,584
He's coming this way.

369
00:20:06,619 --> 00:20:07,620
Say something.

370
00:20:07,654 --> 00:20:09,069
- [squeals] Broccoli broccoli!

371
00:20:09,104 --> 00:20:10,726
- Stop it, Debbie. [laughing]

372
00:20:10,761 --> 00:20:11,762
- Excuse me.

373
00:20:11,796 --> 00:20:14,730
You don't know who I am,
but you're Liz Taylor.

374
00:20:14,765 --> 00:20:15,973
- Oh, I hate that name.

375
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:17,112
- Liz, or Taylor?

376
00:20:17,146 --> 00:20:18,631
I can change one of them.

377
00:20:18,665 --> 00:20:19,183
- Liz.

378
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,529
- I'm Nicky Hilton.

379
00:20:20,564 --> 00:20:22,497
- And this is a close friend
of mine, Debbie Reynolds.

380
00:20:22,531 --> 00:20:23,843
- Debbie.

381
00:20:23,877 --> 00:20:25,224
As her close friend,

382
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:27,778
do you think Elizabeth
should dance with me?

383
00:20:27,812 --> 00:20:30,194
- I'm always telling Elizabeth what to do,

384
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,300
and she never listens. [laughing]

385
00:20:32,334 --> 00:20:34,129
- Okay wiseguy, what should I do?

386
00:20:34,163 --> 00:20:35,889
- Go dance with him.

387
00:20:37,822 --> 00:20:40,687
[slow jazz music]

388
00:21:01,605 --> 00:21:05,298
- Test for picture number
17271, Father Of The Bride,

389
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:09,889
director Vincent Minelli,
actor Elizabeth Taylor.

390
00:21:09,923 --> 00:21:10,890
- Turn, please.

391
00:21:10,924 --> 00:21:11,891
Turn right.

392
00:21:11,925 --> 00:21:12,788
And left.

393
00:21:18,035 --> 00:21:20,106
- It's crazy, I know, so sudden.

394
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:24,317
But if I mean to escape
I've got only two options.

395
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,905
College, or marriage.

396
00:21:25,939 --> 00:21:29,115
And with everyone making
my decisions for me,

397
00:21:29,149 --> 00:21:31,531
I can't even pee without instructions.

398
00:21:31,566 --> 00:21:34,465
- Uh oh, Bessie Mae, sound
like you're going method on me,

399
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,571
what with a the Father
Of The Bride and all.

400
00:21:36,605 --> 00:21:38,952
- [laughing] Be serious.

401
00:21:38,987 --> 00:21:40,402
- Okay.

402
00:21:40,437 --> 00:21:42,404
Do you love this guy?

403
00:21:44,268 --> 00:21:45,787
- Would you mind?

404
00:21:47,616 --> 00:21:51,931
- [sighs] I just want you
to be happy, that's all.

405
00:21:52,863 --> 00:21:54,796
You be careful, though.

406
00:21:55,797 --> 00:21:57,350
Whatever you decide,

407
00:21:57,385 --> 00:21:58,903
I heard a few things.

408
00:22:00,042 --> 00:22:03,977
- You mean he's not an
actor or a suffering poet.

409
00:22:04,012 --> 00:22:04,978
[laughing]

410
00:22:05,013 --> 00:22:07,153
I do believe you're jealous.

411
00:22:07,187 --> 00:22:08,844
- Okay, maybe I am.

412
00:22:09,776 --> 00:22:10,846
- Well, good.

413
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:14,919
[cheering]

414
00:22:28,933 --> 00:22:30,245
- What's next, Liz?

415
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:32,661
- Well I want nothing more than
to spend the rest of my life

416
00:22:32,696 --> 00:22:36,078
as Mrs. Conrad Nicholson Hilton Junior.

417
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,367
- Oh good evening.

418
00:22:48,401 --> 00:22:50,576
Hasn't it been a lovely day?

419
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:53,026
Do please follow me.

420
00:22:55,581 --> 00:22:57,376
Miss Taylor, this is your table.

421
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:58,722
- Wrong, pal.

422
00:22:58,756 --> 00:23:02,242
We're looking for the table
of Mr. and Mrs. Hilton.

423
00:23:02,277 --> 00:23:05,004
- Oh Mr. Hilton, I do apologize.

424
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:07,696
This of course is your table.

425
00:23:07,731 --> 00:23:08,732
- Thank you.

426
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,149
- Bon appetit.

427
00:23:13,978 --> 00:23:14,979
- Husband.

428
00:23:15,014 --> 00:23:19,363
I've only been able to
stay that for a week.

429
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,710
Husband, husband, husband.

430
00:23:23,781 --> 00:23:26,439
Promise you'll love me forever.

431
00:23:26,474 --> 00:23:28,752
No, more than forever.

432
00:23:28,786 --> 00:23:29,649
- Fine.

433
00:23:30,995 --> 00:23:34,378
- If you were an actor, I'd
make you work on that reading.

434
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,345
- Well I'm not an actor, okay?

435
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,623
You got that?

436
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,492
- Oh please, this is my honeymoon.

437
00:23:44,526 --> 00:23:46,148
- Oh please, just one.

438
00:23:46,183 --> 00:23:47,495
- Yes, please.

439
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,778
- Are you famous too?

440
00:23:54,812 --> 00:23:57,919
- Not to old bats like you I'm not.

441
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,577
- The nerve of him.

442
00:24:04,304 --> 00:24:05,167
Thank you.

443
00:24:09,137 --> 00:24:11,208
- This is my honeymoon.

444
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:12,209
- Mine too.

445
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:14,038
- Don't embarrass me.

446
00:24:14,901 --> 00:24:15,592
- Waiter.

447
00:24:15,626 --> 00:24:18,215
Bring us a fifth of something.

448
00:24:19,078 --> 00:24:19,941
Gin!

449
00:24:30,192 --> 00:24:31,021
And raise.

450
00:24:42,066 --> 00:24:43,861
- Three threes, fold.

451
00:24:46,312 --> 00:24:49,626
[wistful piano music]

452
00:25:18,965 --> 00:25:21,554
[glass breaking]

453
00:25:21,589 --> 00:25:22,486
- Nicky, honey?

454
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,177
That you?

455
00:25:24,212 --> 00:25:25,075
- Yeah.

456
00:25:30,598 --> 00:25:32,323
- Are you all right?

457
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:34,602
- Yeah.

458
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,578
- Win big?

459
00:25:46,475 --> 00:25:47,269
- Yeah.

460
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:50,583
Don't ever pull that Hollywood star crap

461
00:25:50,618 --> 00:25:52,930
with me again, you bitch.

462
00:25:52,965 --> 00:25:55,692
[cries in pain]

463
00:26:04,424 --> 00:26:07,600
- There were many violent outbursts.

464
00:26:11,155 --> 00:26:13,226
He was indifferent to me.

465
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,544
- I'm sorry Mrs. Hilton,
we just can't hear you.

466
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,960
- He was indifferent to me.

467
00:26:24,065 --> 00:26:27,102
It caused me great mental anguish.

468
00:26:28,863 --> 00:26:32,314
- I understand that you have
substantial income of your own

469
00:26:32,349 --> 00:26:34,109
and you wish to waive any alimony,

470
00:26:34,144 --> 00:26:38,148
and that you petition for the
right to use your maiden name.

471
00:26:38,182 --> 00:26:39,218
- Yes.

472
00:26:39,252 --> 00:26:43,015
- Divorce granted, this
marriage is dissolved.

473
00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:45,914
[people shouting]

474
00:26:48,917 --> 00:26:51,264
- Miss Taylor, what's next for you?

475
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:53,922
- How do you feel, Miss Taylor?

476
00:27:09,317 --> 00:27:10,559
- I've let myself in.

477
00:27:10,594 --> 00:27:12,458
- Mother, this is my place.

478
00:27:12,492 --> 00:27:15,185
- Well, shall I go back out to knock?

479
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:17,290
What's that your cooking?

480
00:27:17,325 --> 00:27:19,430
French toast for lunch?

481
00:27:19,465 --> 00:27:21,536
Well I won't say a word.

482
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:23,124
Isn't this nice?

483
00:27:23,158 --> 00:27:24,677
Your own place.

484
00:27:24,712 --> 00:27:27,197
My little girl, all grown up.

485
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:30,787
You know, we haven't said
a thing about Ivanhoe yet.

486
00:27:30,821 --> 00:27:34,687
- [sighs] I am committed,
but it's a terrible script.

487
00:27:34,722 --> 00:27:37,759
- Well that may well be,
but a few months in London,

488
00:27:37,794 --> 00:27:39,381
away from all the press,

489
00:27:39,416 --> 00:27:40,969
help them forget about your marriage.

490
00:27:41,004 --> 00:27:41,832
- Mummy.

491
00:27:41,867 --> 00:27:43,696
- Darling, clean up that egg, will you?

492
00:27:43,731 --> 00:27:44,732
It's dripping.

493
00:27:44,766 --> 00:27:47,079
- Mummy, have you spoken with Ben Thau?

494
00:27:47,113 --> 00:27:48,494
- About what?

495
00:27:48,528 --> 00:27:50,082
- About London.

496
00:27:50,116 --> 00:27:52,222
- [laughing] Well I know
all about London darling,

497
00:27:52,256 --> 00:27:54,362
we used to live there.

498
00:27:54,396 --> 00:27:58,815
- About how I won't be
needing a chaperone there.

499
00:27:59,539 --> 00:28:01,990
- This was Mr. Thau's idea?

500
00:28:02,025 --> 00:28:03,474
- And even though you'll be staying,

501
00:28:03,509 --> 00:28:05,304
you'll still be on salary.

502
00:28:05,338 --> 00:28:06,719
Benny promised.

503
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,549
- I see.

504
00:28:09,584 --> 00:28:12,449
- I'm sorry, but it's as you said.

505
00:28:13,381 --> 00:28:14,900
I'm all grown up.

506
00:28:16,867 --> 00:28:19,249
- You're burning the toast.

507
00:28:20,837 --> 00:28:22,079
- All right, turn over.

508
00:28:22,114 --> 00:28:23,253
Camera rolling.

509
00:28:23,287 --> 00:28:23,943
Speed.

510
00:28:23,978 --> 00:28:25,531
Ivanhoe 72, marker.

511
00:28:25,565 --> 00:28:26,532
[board clapping]

512
00:28:26,566 --> 00:28:27,740
And, action.

513
00:28:28,603 --> 00:28:31,917
- That is the way it must be, Rebecca.

514
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:37,888
That is the way it must be.

515
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:40,339
Take it again.

516
00:28:40,373 --> 00:28:42,893
- But I don't understand why.

517
00:28:42,928 --> 00:28:45,378
- It is the law of the land.

518
00:28:49,244 --> 00:28:50,142
- And cut.

519
00:28:50,176 --> 00:28:51,971
Is there some problem, Elizabeth?

520
00:28:52,006 --> 00:28:53,973
- Yes, this headpiece weighs a ton.

521
00:28:54,008 --> 00:28:55,595
It's killing my poor back.

522
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,183
- Well I'm more concerned about dialogue.

523
00:28:57,218 --> 00:28:58,737
Can we put a little life into it?

524
00:28:58,771 --> 00:29:00,911
- You should have told that to the writer.

525
00:29:00,946 --> 00:29:01,809
- Sir Walter Scott?

526
00:29:01,843 --> 00:29:02,810
He's dead.

527
00:29:02,844 --> 00:29:03,914
- You're telling me.

528
00:29:03,949 --> 00:29:05,744
- Well, if it isn't Michael Wilding,

529
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:07,849
England's answer to Robert Taylor.

530
00:29:07,884 --> 00:29:09,989
- I could never aspire to
fill your chain mail, Robert.

531
00:29:10,024 --> 00:29:11,611
- [laughing] Well, slumming, Michael?

532
00:29:11,646 --> 00:29:14,891
Or have you rediscovered a
passion for Sir Walter Scott.

533
00:29:14,925 --> 00:29:16,478
- As a matter of fact,
I've become all curious

534
00:29:16,513 --> 00:29:18,964
about the ways and habits
of Hollywood starlets.

535
00:29:18,998 --> 00:29:21,069
- Well, this one's having a fit.

536
00:29:21,104 --> 00:29:24,417
- Quite fantastic, just
like a storm at sea.

537
00:29:24,452 --> 00:29:26,074
Don't care how many ships go down,

538
00:29:26,109 --> 00:29:28,076
just as long as we can watch them.

539
00:29:28,111 --> 00:29:30,320
[laughing]

540
00:29:33,047 --> 00:29:35,774
- Am I allowed to meet your friend?

541
00:29:35,808 --> 00:29:37,430
- This is Michael Wilding.

542
00:29:37,465 --> 00:29:39,329
Michael, this is Elizabeth Taylor.

543
00:29:39,363 --> 00:29:40,226
- Hello.

544
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,959
[bell ringing]

545
00:29:48,994 --> 00:29:52,169
[sentimental music]

546
00:29:59,245 --> 00:30:02,076
- My dear, you look enchanting.

547
00:30:03,836 --> 00:30:04,872
Please.

548
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:09,808
- Can you believe this is the first night

549
00:30:09,842 --> 00:30:11,395
I've been out on the town?

550
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,396
- You know, I don't.

551
00:30:12,431 --> 00:30:13,328
A beauty like you.

552
00:30:13,363 --> 00:30:14,951
- Strange, everyone takes for granted

553
00:30:14,985 --> 00:30:18,471
that I have a date every night,
and nobody thinks to ask.

554
00:30:18,506 --> 00:30:19,921
- Oh, so I'm Mr. Nobody?

555
00:30:19,956 --> 00:30:22,372
- [laughing] You are funny.

556
00:30:22,406 --> 00:30:23,545
- For an older man?

557
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,444
- Stop that, my father's an older man.

558
00:30:25,478 --> 00:30:28,205
- Are you quite sure
you wanted to say that?

559
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,345
[laughing]

560
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,519
- I like older men.

561
00:30:31,553 --> 00:30:36,213
They're wise about things
like, you know, life, love.

562
00:30:36,248 --> 00:30:39,251
- I'm not sure anyone's really that wise.

563
00:30:39,285 --> 00:30:40,286
Not about love.

564
00:30:40,321 --> 00:30:42,910
The poets claim it, but I don't think

565
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:45,913
they really know what
they're complaining about.

566
00:30:45,947 --> 00:30:49,330
- God, if you couldn't believe in love.

567
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,609
- Do you believe in love?

568
00:30:52,643 --> 00:30:54,266
- I used to.

569
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:58,339
Used to be the most
important thing in my life.

570
00:30:58,373 --> 00:31:00,272
- I'm terribly sorry.

571
00:31:00,306 --> 00:31:05,277
- I'll bet you'd marry me if
I were older, wouldn't you?

572
00:31:05,311 --> 00:31:06,312
- I tell you what.

573
00:31:06,347 --> 00:31:10,247
You stay the same age,
and I'll get younger.

574
00:31:27,195 --> 00:31:30,164
- Elizabeth, please, no
thanks are necessary.

575
00:31:30,198 --> 00:31:32,683
We've always been a family here at Metro.

576
00:31:32,718 --> 00:31:34,685
Beside the, Michael's a great actor.

577
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,343
We'd be more than happy
to put him under contract.

578
00:31:37,378 --> 00:31:40,484
- Oh, it'd be such a
help to us, thank you.

579
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:41,347
- Good.

580
00:31:41,382 --> 00:31:42,383
- Also, a loan.

581
00:31:42,417 --> 00:31:44,868
We would love to get a house, a big house.

582
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,353
We're so eager to start
a family, you know.

583
00:31:47,388 --> 00:31:49,942
And have dozens of children. [laughing]

584
00:31:49,977 --> 00:31:51,633
- Well yes, but not too soon.

585
00:31:51,668 --> 00:31:55,948
Elizabeth, we have big
plans for you, you know.

586
00:31:56,845 --> 00:31:58,157
[laughing]

587
00:31:58,192 --> 00:32:00,366
- You are certifiable, you know that?

588
00:32:00,401 --> 00:32:02,403
- Michaelangelo had the
roof of the Sistine.

589
00:32:02,437 --> 00:32:04,336
I make due with only slightly less space.

590
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:05,993
- Bugger off, you British weasel.

591
00:32:06,027 --> 00:32:08,133
- You're as big as a
barn and mad as a hatter

592
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:10,929
and I love you and I want you.

593
00:32:11,895 --> 00:32:13,966
- Don't forget to sign.

594
00:32:15,347 --> 00:32:17,556
[laughing]

595
00:32:34,366 --> 00:32:35,436
- Oh, Elizabeth.

596
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:38,680
You won't believe this
script the studio sent me,

597
00:32:38,715 --> 00:32:41,304
it's nonsense, utter nonsense.

598
00:32:41,338 --> 00:32:44,583
- What is this, the third,
fourth script you've rejected?

599
00:32:44,617 --> 00:32:47,586
No pay, no play, Michael,
read the fine print.

600
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:50,727
- You'd think they'd send
me anything top drawer.

601
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:53,764
I mean, a man does have his dignity.

602
00:32:55,352 --> 00:32:58,252
- Dignity doesn't pay the bills, I do.

603
00:32:58,286 --> 00:33:00,771
I've done four dreadful
films back to back,

604
00:33:00,806 --> 00:33:04,672
and to be perfectly honest
with you, I feel as...

605
00:33:04,706 --> 00:33:07,295
I feel as though I'm drowning.

606
00:33:15,717 --> 00:33:20,205
A bit of help from the home
front wouldn't be amiss.

607
00:33:29,593 --> 00:33:30,422
- And cut!

608
00:33:30,456 --> 00:33:31,216
[whistling]

609
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,079
Print.

610
00:33:32,113 --> 00:33:35,496
Get this over to the production office.

611
00:33:36,635 --> 00:33:39,638
- Hey dollface, you made it.

612
00:33:39,672 --> 00:33:41,053
You meet Jimmy?

613
00:33:42,192 --> 00:33:43,573
- Hello, Jimmy!

614
00:33:45,368 --> 00:33:46,990
Is he always like that?

615
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,268
- No, sometimes he's just rude.

616
00:33:49,303 --> 00:33:50,925
Hey George, look who's here.

617
00:33:50,959 --> 00:33:52,202
- Hello Mama.

618
00:33:52,237 --> 00:33:53,514
- Hello potato face.

619
00:33:53,548 --> 00:33:56,034
- That's right dollface,
you show him who's boss.

620
00:33:56,068 --> 00:33:57,242
- You know why you're here?

621
00:33:57,276 --> 00:33:59,382
Because I told old George
I wanted Liz Taylor

622
00:33:59,416 --> 00:34:00,866
or I wouldn't do this damn thing.

623
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,178
What do you think of that?

624
00:34:02,212 --> 00:34:04,318
- Well I think you're
pretty terrific, Mr. Hudson.

625
00:34:04,352 --> 00:34:06,423
A film like Giant doesn't
come along every day.

626
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:08,322
- Well neither does a face
and figure like yours.

627
00:34:08,356 --> 00:34:12,015
You're so beautiful Liz,
a man has to squint.

628
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,224
- That's the problem.

629
00:34:14,259 --> 00:34:18,228
Until you get rid of
that phony MGM veneer,

630
00:34:18,263 --> 00:34:20,748
you never will be an actress.

631
00:34:25,718 --> 00:34:27,789
- Excuse me, Mr. Stevens.

632
00:34:40,492 --> 00:34:43,219
[playful music]

633
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:52,228
Is this what a real actress
is supposed to look like?

634
00:34:55,023 --> 00:34:59,407
Hey, I want it understood,
I'm more than a pretty face.

635
00:34:59,442 --> 00:35:00,305
Got that?

636
00:35:01,029 --> 00:35:03,411
[laughing]

637
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:13,145
- God pity the guy that doesn't pay homage

638
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,905
to that pretty face.

639
00:35:19,772 --> 00:35:23,155
[bright country music]

640
00:35:26,262 --> 00:35:27,504
- What you got there?

641
00:35:27,539 --> 00:35:30,473
- I got a little vodka,
mixed with a vermouthy.

642
00:35:30,507 --> 00:35:32,544
- I got no vermouthy, partner.

643
00:35:32,578 --> 00:35:36,237
- Well here partner, what are you having?

644
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,171
- Kahlua.

645
00:35:39,206 --> 00:35:41,173
[laughing]

646
00:35:41,208 --> 00:35:42,864
- Hey, do you mind?

647
00:35:48,594 --> 00:35:52,909
You know what you get when
you mix vodka with Kahlua?

648
00:36:00,227 --> 00:36:01,780
Chocolate martini.

649
00:36:01,814 --> 00:36:04,196
[laughing]

650
00:36:08,338 --> 00:36:10,168
Chocolate martinis!

651
00:36:13,516 --> 00:36:15,725
[laughing]

652
00:36:19,694 --> 00:36:20,695
- City folk.

653
00:36:33,398 --> 00:36:34,537
- Good evening.

654
00:36:34,571 --> 00:36:36,332
Could you direct me to
Miss Taylor, please.

655
00:36:36,366 --> 00:36:37,333
- I'm sorry, sir.

656
00:36:37,367 --> 00:36:38,886
- I've just flown into this place

657
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,819
from an air core base in El Paso.

658
00:36:40,853 --> 00:36:42,441
I'm tired, I'm hungry,

659
00:36:42,476 --> 00:36:44,995
and I'd like to see Miss Elizabeth Taylor.

660
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:45,686
I'm the husband?

661
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,756
- Oh yes sir.

662
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:50,829
I believe she's having
dinner with Mr. Hudson.

663
00:36:55,868 --> 00:36:58,077
[laughing]

664
00:36:58,112 --> 00:37:00,977
[emotional music]

665
00:37:17,994 --> 00:37:18,857
- Hello.

666
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:23,241
I always seem to

667
00:37:23,275 --> 00:37:26,830
fall a little in love with my leading man.

668
00:37:30,282 --> 00:37:32,008
Guess I always will.

669
00:37:33,803 --> 00:37:34,873
It's nothing.

670
00:37:52,546 --> 00:37:56,860
- Well I guess everything
ain't perfect in paradise.

671
00:38:02,003 --> 00:38:04,592
- Come on, little one, let's go.

672
00:38:04,627 --> 00:38:08,941
It's nap time, we can get
up and play later, okay?

673
00:38:11,427 --> 00:38:12,255
- Thank you.

674
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,532
My God am I having fun.

675
00:38:13,567 --> 00:38:15,741
- You will try to be pleasant, won't you?

676
00:38:15,776 --> 00:38:18,330
There's some people here
that could help you.

677
00:38:18,365 --> 00:38:20,090
- You know I haven't got
your talent, Elizabeth.

678
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:21,126
I can't just snap my fingers

679
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,886
and have any man do what I want.

680
00:38:22,921 --> 00:38:25,303
- Am I really so bad?

681
00:38:25,337 --> 00:38:26,304
- Bad, no.

682
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:27,719
Spoiled, maybe.

683
00:38:30,515 --> 00:38:34,484
- I didn't mean for it
to turn out like this.

684
00:38:35,416 --> 00:38:37,073
I do love you.

685
00:38:37,107 --> 00:38:38,626
- When business permits.

686
00:38:38,661 --> 00:38:40,973
But why should I complain?

687
00:38:50,155 --> 00:38:52,295
- Come on, Bessie, have some bubbles.

688
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,608
- [laughing] Rock.

689
00:38:54,642 --> 00:38:56,541
- What's the skinny on Rain Tree?

690
00:38:56,575 --> 00:38:57,990
- Strictly hush hush.

691
00:38:58,025 --> 00:39:00,027
The South loses, you know.

692
00:39:00,061 --> 00:39:01,131
- Good script?

693
00:39:01,166 --> 00:39:04,411
- I suppose it's sort of
a Scarlet O'Hara gone mad.

694
00:39:04,445 --> 00:39:06,205
But I don't get to kiss Clark Gable.

695
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,035
I get that sweet pea.

696
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:15,456
- I thought you were too tired to come.

697
00:39:15,491 --> 00:39:17,424
- Too tired to come, Michael.

698
00:39:17,458 --> 00:39:20,047
But Bessie Mae called and called.

699
00:39:20,081 --> 00:39:20,910
- And what?

700
00:39:20,944 --> 00:39:21,773
- She always wins.

701
00:39:21,807 --> 00:39:23,222
- Oh, yes.

702
00:39:23,257 --> 00:39:26,191
- I guess you wanna talk about, um.

703
00:39:26,225 --> 00:39:27,882
Well, you know.

704
00:39:27,917 --> 00:39:30,126
She has marital problems.

705
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,748
- She does indeed.

706
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:37,133
You know, I think Elizabeth's
biggest problem is,

707
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:39,515
she can have any man she wants.

708
00:39:40,585 --> 00:39:42,621
- And that compelled you
to cavort in the pool

709
00:39:42,656 --> 00:39:45,728
with a couple of, what were they, Michael?

710
00:39:45,762 --> 00:39:46,763
Strippers?

711
00:39:46,798 --> 00:39:49,007
Who told everything to
Confidential Magazine.

712
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:50,077
- Utter nonsense.

713
00:39:50,111 --> 00:39:52,666
These girls dropped by,
nothing really happened.

714
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,807
And how was I to know
they'd sell the story?

715
00:39:55,841 --> 00:39:56,670
- Michael.

716
00:39:56,704 --> 00:39:57,360
- Uh huh.

717
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,396
- You live in Hollywood.

718
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:01,813
And you're married to Elizabeth Taylor.

719
00:40:08,682 --> 00:40:10,891
- I heard she was in
Texas with whatshisname,

720
00:40:10,925 --> 00:40:12,306
doing God knows what.

721
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,584
And what was I supposed to do here?

722
00:40:14,619 --> 00:40:16,552
Scoop up after the bloody dogs.

723
00:40:16,586 --> 00:40:19,727
You know, she sleeps every
night surrounded by her animals.

724
00:40:19,762 --> 00:40:22,074
I mean, where does that leave me?

725
00:40:22,109 --> 00:40:25,215
- Here's to the dogs of marriage.

726
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,113
- Cheers.

727
00:40:27,114 --> 00:40:29,496
[laughing]

728
00:40:33,569 --> 00:40:35,571
- Why don't you just sleep here?

729
00:40:35,605 --> 00:40:37,331
- No no really, I'm fine.

730
00:40:37,365 --> 00:40:38,332
- You know, it's okay.

731
00:40:38,366 --> 00:40:39,644
I'll get in front of him.

732
00:40:39,678 --> 00:40:41,128
- What good will that do?

733
00:40:41,162 --> 00:40:45,132
- It'll keep him slow,
guide the way for him.

734
00:40:46,202 --> 00:40:47,065
- So long.

735
00:40:48,894 --> 00:40:49,550
- Be careful.

736
00:40:49,585 --> 00:40:51,828
- I'll call you tomorrow.

737
00:40:58,904 --> 00:41:01,493
[tense music]

738
00:41:31,696 --> 00:41:34,802
[tires screeching]

739
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,742
[crashing]

740
00:42:20,158 --> 00:42:21,055
Okay.

741
00:42:22,332 --> 00:42:24,783
What? You can't breathe.

742
00:42:27,372 --> 00:42:28,615
It's a tooth.

743
00:42:28,649 --> 00:42:30,755
Mama's got it, it's okay.

744
00:42:35,587 --> 00:42:38,038
[indistinct chatter]

745
00:42:50,291 --> 00:42:51,396
- It's Monty Clift.

746
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:54,606
- Stop it, get the hell out of here!

747
00:42:55,538 --> 00:42:57,851
Vultures, get out of here!

748
00:42:59,231 --> 00:43:00,094
Get away!

749
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,391
[sirens blaring]

750
00:43:26,431 --> 00:43:27,294
Yoo hoo!

751
00:43:28,226 --> 00:43:28,709
Monty!

752
00:43:28,744 --> 00:43:30,124
Here he is, Monty.

753
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:34,542
Your replacement if you're
not back on the set in a week.

754
00:43:34,577 --> 00:43:35,889
Now, he's good, baby.

755
00:43:35,923 --> 00:43:38,236
Trained in the method, you know.

756
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:39,099
- Oh no.

757
00:43:39,133 --> 00:43:39,996
- Yes.

758
00:43:40,928 --> 00:43:43,655
I've missed you, you sweet old disaster.

759
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:45,139
But you look great.

760
00:43:45,174 --> 00:43:46,175
- So they tell me.

761
00:43:46,209 --> 00:43:47,245
- Well they're right.

762
00:43:47,279 --> 00:43:51,007
- Why are you so excited
about, what's going on?

763
00:43:51,042 --> 00:43:53,596
- I ran into Mike Todd again last night.

764
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,459
- Oh.

765
00:43:54,493 --> 00:43:55,840
- He's really great fun.

766
00:43:55,874 --> 00:43:59,671
[sighs] And so different from Michael.

767
00:43:59,706 --> 00:44:01,777
- What about Michael?

768
00:44:01,811 --> 00:44:03,779
- What about Michael?

769
00:44:07,127 --> 00:44:09,405
[phone ringing]

770
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:10,924
- Michael Wilding.

771
00:44:10,958 --> 00:44:12,650
- Michael, it's Elizabeth.

772
00:44:12,684 --> 00:44:14,134
- Elizabeth, so nice to hear you.

773
00:44:14,168 --> 00:44:16,723
Tell me, how's Monty getting along?

774
00:44:16,757 --> 00:44:18,069
- Oh he's fine, fine.

775
00:44:18,103 --> 00:44:19,104
Um, Michael.

776
00:44:20,381 --> 00:44:22,729
I need you to know that I love you

777
00:44:22,763 --> 00:44:24,316
and I will always love you.

778
00:44:24,351 --> 00:44:25,559
- That's very comforting.

779
00:44:25,593 --> 00:44:27,388
- What I'm trying to say,

780
00:44:27,423 --> 00:44:28,942
and I want you to hear it from me

781
00:44:28,976 --> 00:44:31,945
before it appears in the papers,

782
00:44:31,979 --> 00:44:35,293
darling, I filed for legal separation.

783
00:44:39,504 --> 00:44:40,505
- Well thanks, but I'd rather

784
00:44:40,539 --> 00:44:42,024
have read it in the newspapers.

785
00:44:42,058 --> 00:44:43,335
- Yes?

786
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:47,857
- I could have pretended it had
to do with two other people.

787
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:08,395
- You tell me if I'm
interrupting, I'll get lost.

788
00:45:08,429 --> 00:45:10,708
- Not at all Mike, we
were waiting for you.

789
00:45:10,742 --> 00:45:13,572
- Yes we were, though I'm not sure why.

790
00:45:13,607 --> 00:45:14,470
- Are you leaving?

791
00:45:14,504 --> 00:45:15,574
- Me? No, why?

792
00:45:15,609 --> 00:45:16,437
This is my office.

793
00:45:16,472 --> 00:45:17,300
It says so on the door.

794
00:45:17,335 --> 00:45:18,129
Benny Thau.

795
00:45:18,163 --> 00:45:19,993
- I thought you was going some place.

796
00:45:20,027 --> 00:45:23,272
- Benny, I think he's being subtle.

797
00:45:23,306 --> 00:45:26,171
- Oh. [chuckling]

798
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:31,729
Hey, excuse me.

799
00:45:31,763 --> 00:45:34,559
- Well don't run off, Benny.

800
00:45:34,593 --> 00:45:36,009
Please, don't run off.

801
00:45:36,043 --> 00:45:38,114
- Please, play nice Mike.

802
00:45:39,391 --> 00:45:42,705
- Well I'm not used to being
summoned this way, Mr. Todd.

803
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,569
I've been waiting, what is it, 30 minutes?

804
00:45:44,603 --> 00:45:45,915
- You comfortable there?

805
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:47,848
- Hey, get your mitts off of me!

806
00:45:47,883 --> 00:45:49,332
- Hey there, is that more comfortable?

807
00:45:49,367 --> 00:45:51,403
Now you're the damnedest
prettiest woman I ever saw.

808
00:45:51,438 --> 00:45:53,751
That's for openers.

809
00:45:53,785 --> 00:45:55,718
Now, I'm gonna lay my lot on the table

810
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,030
and I think you'll have to take a look

811
00:45:57,064 --> 00:45:58,963
and consider the cards I have showing.

812
00:45:58,997 --> 00:46:00,965
I was president of my own
company when I was 18.

813
00:46:00,999 --> 00:46:03,070
The age I am now, and that ain't that old,

814
00:46:03,105 --> 00:46:05,763
I've produced 16 shows up in Central Park,

815
00:46:05,797 --> 00:46:07,143
maybe you've heard of it?

816
00:46:07,178 --> 00:46:07,903
The Hot Mercado?

817
00:46:07,937 --> 00:46:08,938
Anyway, the bottom line is,

818
00:46:08,973 --> 00:46:10,595
I grossed 18 million bucks on Broadway,

819
00:46:10,629 --> 00:46:13,253
and that's just the cards I have showing.

820
00:46:13,287 --> 00:46:15,738
Now, you didn't ask me
what my hold card is.

821
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,498
You only see the up cards.

822
00:46:17,533 --> 00:46:18,499
Nothing but aces.

823
00:46:18,534 --> 00:46:20,847
But the hold card is, Miss Taylor,

824
00:46:20,881 --> 00:46:22,193
and I will turn it over for you,

825
00:46:22,227 --> 00:46:25,196
the hold card is, I'm in love with you.

826
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:27,439
Don't argue against it,
because I know how I feel.

827
00:46:27,474 --> 00:46:28,509
- You what?

828
00:46:28,544 --> 00:46:30,166
- I know it surprised
the hell out of me too,

829
00:46:30,201 --> 00:46:31,996
but not half as much as this, baby.

830
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:33,273
I not only love you,

831
00:46:33,307 --> 00:46:34,757
I'm gonna marry you.

832
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,932
What do you say to that?

833
00:46:38,381 --> 00:46:39,210
- Speechless.

834
00:46:39,244 --> 00:46:39,900
- Oh, great!

835
00:46:39,935 --> 00:46:41,315
You believe in fate?

836
00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:42,489
- I believe I'm leaving.

837
00:46:42,523 --> 00:46:43,248
- Liz, Liz!

838
00:46:43,283 --> 00:46:45,492
Now don't get on my bad side now.

839
00:46:45,526 --> 00:46:47,011
- Don't call me Liz, Mr. Todd.

840
00:46:47,045 --> 00:46:48,391
- All right, Miss Taylor.

841
00:46:48,426 --> 00:46:50,566
We're getting married because
like I said, it's fate.

842
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,705
And I love you.

843
00:46:51,739 --> 00:46:54,087
- Do you understand I'm a married woman?

844
00:46:54,121 --> 00:46:55,985
- I understand you're breaking up.

845
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:57,815
- It's none of your damned business.

846
00:46:57,849 --> 00:46:59,057
- I'm making it my business.

847
00:46:59,092 --> 00:47:01,094
- And I don't like being
mauled in an office,

848
00:47:01,128 --> 00:47:02,198
thrown around the furniture,

849
00:47:02,233 --> 00:47:05,546
and told who I'm going to marry next!

850
00:47:05,581 --> 00:47:06,789
- You know what this means?

851
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:07,997
- What what means?

852
00:47:08,032 --> 00:47:09,205
- It means you and me,

853
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,415
you are never going to see me again!

854
00:47:16,557 --> 00:47:17,420
Ever!

855
00:47:18,732 --> 00:47:21,459
[door slamming]

856
00:47:25,118 --> 00:47:27,189
- Great to have you back,
Monty, you look terrific.

857
00:47:27,223 --> 00:47:30,226
Hell, we all should look
so good before a car crash.

858
00:47:30,261 --> 00:47:34,127
All right everyone, we'll
block in half an hour.

859
00:47:34,161 --> 00:47:36,508
- I have a present for you.

860
00:47:36,543 --> 00:47:37,406
- What?

861
00:47:40,892 --> 00:47:43,412
[gasps] Ooh.

862
00:47:46,346 --> 00:47:47,209
Monty.

863
00:47:48,348 --> 00:47:49,590
- It's the tooth.

864
00:47:49,625 --> 00:47:50,971
[laughing]

865
00:47:51,006 --> 00:47:53,042
- I like a good joke.

866
00:47:53,077 --> 00:47:54,595
- What are you doing here?

867
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:56,045
- Well I was flying east on business

868
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,426
and I heard you were back on your feet

869
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:58,979
and I thought I'd make a little detour,

870
00:47:59,014 --> 00:48:00,429
and, Mike Todd.

871
00:48:00,463 --> 00:48:01,879
- Thanks, Mike.

872
00:48:01,913 --> 00:48:03,294
- Roses.

873
00:48:03,328 --> 00:48:05,020
How very ordinary.

874
00:48:05,054 --> 00:48:08,644
- Well then I'm glad I
didn't bring them for you.

875
00:48:08,678 --> 00:48:10,542
My mother had a fondness for roses.

876
00:48:10,577 --> 00:48:11,440
I thought they would add

877
00:48:11,474 --> 00:48:13,166
to your general enjoyment of the occasion.

878
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,684
- Thanks again, Mike.

879
00:48:14,719 --> 00:48:15,582
Excuse me.

880
00:48:17,722 --> 00:48:20,587
- You're right, roses are ordinary.

881
00:48:20,621 --> 00:48:23,210
And there ain't nothing
ordinary about Liz Taylor,

882
00:48:23,245 --> 00:48:26,524
or Mike Todd for that matter.

883
00:48:26,558 --> 00:48:28,008
This is for you.

884
00:48:29,941 --> 00:48:30,977
- Mike.

885
00:48:32,081 --> 00:48:34,773
[gasps] God, it's beautiful.

886
00:48:34,808 --> 00:48:36,844
- I can be a horse's butt, Liz.

887
00:48:36,879 --> 00:48:39,261
I think we've already established that.

888
00:48:39,295 --> 00:48:42,091
But I think also that
I am the man for you.

889
00:48:42,126 --> 00:48:44,093
I think we both know that too.

890
00:48:44,128 --> 00:48:46,164
- Mike, I don't know what to say.

891
00:48:46,199 --> 00:48:49,996
- Well I do, so you just do
the listening, all right?

892
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:52,895
Lizzy, you've been married
to a kid and an old man.

893
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,932
It's time you took a mate.

894
00:48:54,966 --> 00:48:58,452
You know, one who gives
as good as he gets.

895
00:48:58,487 --> 00:48:59,005
Sure, I'll roar.

896
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:00,385
So, you roar back.

897
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:03,906
Then we'll laugh our asses
off while we spend my money.

898
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:04,976
[laughing]

899
00:49:05,011 --> 00:49:08,393
- I heard you always get what you want.

900
00:49:08,428 --> 00:49:09,256
- Is that bad?

901
00:49:09,291 --> 00:49:10,050
- No, no.

902
00:49:11,155 --> 00:49:14,986
I admire a man who get
anything what he wants.

903
00:49:15,021 --> 00:49:17,264
As long as he sets his heart to it.

904
00:49:17,299 --> 00:49:21,130
- I already told you
where my heart is set.

905
00:49:37,457 --> 00:49:42,565
- Now it's time to kiss! [laughing]

906
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,533
[clapping]

907
00:49:44,567 --> 00:49:47,225
[bright music]

908
00:50:10,938 --> 00:50:13,251
[booming]

909
00:50:29,992 --> 00:50:32,339
[laughing]

910
00:50:33,271 --> 00:50:36,102
- Oh Mike, look, our initials.

911
00:50:36,136 --> 00:50:38,656
We're up in the sky together.

912
00:50:39,726 --> 00:50:42,453
Oh Mike look, there's something.

913
00:50:44,006 --> 00:50:46,802
Promise me you'll never leave me.

914
00:50:48,666 --> 00:50:49,529
Promise.

915
00:50:59,332 --> 00:51:00,229
- You get the picture?

916
00:51:00,264 --> 00:51:01,782
The plane is about to taxi out.

917
00:51:01,817 --> 00:51:03,025
I'm looking for her.

918
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,992
Where is this fathead I married?

919
00:51:05,027 --> 00:51:06,028
- This is extraordinary,

920
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:07,719
you mixed mashed potatoes with the corn?

921
00:51:07,754 --> 00:51:08,617
- And cream.

922
00:51:08,651 --> 00:51:10,308
- So I called airport security and I say,

923
00:51:10,343 --> 00:51:12,931
you guys seen some
overdressed fatass around?

924
00:51:12,966 --> 00:51:14,278
- We're not listening, Mike.

925
00:51:14,312 --> 00:51:15,589
- You know, it's real important

926
00:51:15,624 --> 00:51:17,557
that you two are here with Debbie and me.

927
00:51:17,591 --> 00:51:20,456
- Come on Eddie, now I'm
trying to tell you the story.

928
00:51:20,491 --> 00:51:23,045
- Debbie.
- Will you listen please?

929
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,633
- To Elizabeth, to Mike,

930
00:51:24,667 --> 00:51:27,601
a man as important to me as my own father.

931
00:51:27,636 --> 00:51:28,602
- Thanks, kid.

932
00:51:28,637 --> 00:51:29,500
Thank you.

933
00:51:30,708 --> 00:51:33,366
So anyway, I'm at
Heathrow, and our plane's

934
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,954
about to hop over the pond, as
they say, and I got no wife.

935
00:51:35,989 --> 00:51:36,783
She's in the bar.

936
00:51:36,817 --> 00:51:37,542
- Flying makes me nervous.

937
00:51:37,577 --> 00:51:38,854
- Sucking up all the bloody marys.

938
00:51:38,888 --> 00:51:40,925
- I was sitting right
underneath the loudspeaker,

939
00:51:40,959 --> 00:51:42,202
waiting to be called.

940
00:51:42,237 --> 00:51:43,790
They never announced the flight.

941
00:51:43,824 --> 00:51:44,825
- Liz, you listen to me.

942
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:46,689
You don't hear nothing
you don't wanna hear.

943
00:51:46,724 --> 00:51:48,519
You're like that damned
Alice in Wonderland.

944
00:51:48,553 --> 00:51:50,037
You are sitting on the other side

945
00:51:50,072 --> 00:51:51,211
of the damned looking glass.

946
00:51:51,246 --> 00:51:53,765
- Imagine, Mike has read
Alice in Wonderland.

947
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,422
- Sure I read it, it's a classic.

948
00:51:55,457 --> 00:51:57,390
- And you read the entire book?

949
00:51:57,424 --> 00:52:01,048
Or some kindly adult read it to you?

950
00:52:01,083 --> 00:52:03,672
[laughing] He's such a child.

951
00:52:03,706 --> 00:52:04,845
- I like children.

952
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,882
- Yes Deborah, we know.

953
00:52:06,916 --> 00:52:08,401
- Golly, is it a federal crime?

954
00:52:08,435 --> 00:52:09,988
All I said is I like children.

955
00:52:10,023 --> 00:52:12,819
- Look broad, I'm the man here, all right?

956
00:52:12,853 --> 00:52:14,338
I'm your kindly adult.

957
00:52:14,372 --> 00:52:16,823
So you just zip up your lip!

958
00:52:18,445 --> 00:52:20,551
What's the matter with you?

959
00:52:20,585 --> 00:52:21,448
You stop.

960
00:52:24,831 --> 00:52:28,179
[playful music]

961
00:52:28,214 --> 00:52:29,870
- Get off of her!

962
00:52:29,905 --> 00:52:31,286
Get off of her!

963
00:52:33,426 --> 00:52:34,289
- Debbie.

964
00:52:38,534 --> 00:52:41,572
- Hey, don't be such a Girl Scout.

965
00:52:42,469 --> 00:52:44,506
You really are square.

966
00:52:45,645 --> 00:52:46,473
- Is there desert?

967
00:52:46,508 --> 00:52:50,753
- Mike loves desert. [laughing]

968
00:52:53,722 --> 00:52:55,310
- It's a wonderful world,

969
00:52:55,344 --> 00:52:59,141
if you'll only take the
time to go around it.

970
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:03,318
- Formally challenging me to
go around the world in 80 days.

971
00:53:03,352 --> 00:53:07,322
- Michael Todd's Around
the World in 80 Days.

972
00:53:09,427 --> 00:53:11,464
We make all the stops.

973
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:13,742
Two oceans.

974
00:53:15,985 --> 00:53:16,848
Five seas.

975
00:53:18,609 --> 00:53:19,955
And 16 countries.

976
00:53:28,343 --> 00:53:29,171
- Welcome home.

977
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:30,586
I guess it's safe to say

978
00:53:30,621 --> 00:53:32,243
that you've taken the world by storm?

979
00:53:32,278 --> 00:53:34,003
- It's all Mike, it's his picture.

980
00:53:34,038 --> 00:53:35,073
I just went along.

981
00:53:35,108 --> 00:53:36,868
- Well there is an awful lot of publicity

982
00:53:36,903 --> 00:53:38,284
about your public spats.

983
00:53:38,318 --> 00:53:39,906
- What? Bite your tongue.

984
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:43,220
- Well you see, I heard
that at the London airport

985
00:53:43,254 --> 00:53:45,912
they had to call security
to separate you two.

986
00:53:45,946 --> 00:53:47,810
Something about a champagne bottle.

987
00:53:47,845 --> 00:53:50,503
- That is the most filthy thing
I've ever heard in my life.

988
00:53:50,537 --> 00:53:51,711
I don't usually get cross.

989
00:53:51,745 --> 00:53:53,022
- Well, what about this?

990
00:53:53,057 --> 00:53:56,025
- Look, I just wish everybody
could be as unhappy as we are,

991
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:58,269
then there'd be no wars and no problems.

992
00:53:58,304 --> 00:53:59,684
The world would be quite nice.

993
00:53:59,719 --> 00:54:00,720
- You know, when I have something to say,

994
00:54:00,754 --> 00:54:02,377
I holler, hey Liz, she says, hey Mike.

995
00:54:02,411 --> 00:54:05,276
You wanna make a case
out of that, too bad.

996
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,070
- It doesn't matter.

997
00:54:06,104 --> 00:54:07,382
- We're so happy.

998
00:54:07,416 --> 00:54:09,970
- I don't care what anybody
thinks, because we know,

999
00:54:10,005 --> 00:54:12,456
and we'll know 10 years
from now, 20 years from now,

1000
00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:13,871
if we're still alive.

1001
00:54:13,905 --> 00:54:15,010
- Liz, Liz, Liz.

1002
00:54:15,044 --> 00:54:17,046
I'm quoting you now.

1003
00:54:17,081 --> 00:54:18,531
You once said that you had

1004
00:54:18,565 --> 00:54:21,050
the mind of a child and
the body of a woman.

1005
00:54:21,085 --> 00:54:23,190
- That's when I was 15, yes.

1006
00:54:23,225 --> 00:54:25,020
- Well now that you're married to such a,

1007
00:54:25,054 --> 00:54:27,402
such a man of the world as Mr. Todd,

1008
00:54:27,436 --> 00:54:29,990
do you think that you're
maturing somewhat?

1009
00:54:30,025 --> 00:54:33,339
- I hope so, otherwise I'd be
slightly retarded, wouldn't I?

1010
00:54:33,373 --> 00:54:35,306
- You're not playing with children here.

1011
00:54:35,341 --> 00:54:37,929
That was a very good comeback.

1012
00:54:40,138 --> 00:54:41,830
Okay, broad.

1013
00:54:41,864 --> 00:54:43,280
I am the man here.

1014
00:54:43,314 --> 00:54:44,695
- Yes.

1015
00:54:44,729 --> 00:54:46,006
- Huh, babydoll?

1016
00:54:46,041 --> 00:54:47,284
- I'm fathead.

1017
00:54:47,318 --> 00:54:49,907
[laughing]

1018
00:54:49,941 --> 00:54:51,184
Meow.

1019
00:54:51,218 --> 00:54:53,462
- Oh, now don't start with the cat.

1020
00:54:53,497 --> 00:54:55,222
- Meow, you don't want me?

1021
00:54:55,257 --> 00:54:56,465
Hmm?

1022
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,536
You don't want your little
cat to purr for you?

1023
00:54:58,571 --> 00:54:59,779
- You're not gonna do that picture.

1024
00:54:59,813 --> 00:55:02,575
- You don't want me on a hot tin roof?

1025
00:55:02,609 --> 00:55:05,543
- [laughing] You're
doing Don Quixote next,

1026
00:55:05,578 --> 00:55:07,304
and you're doing it for me.

1027
00:55:07,338 --> 00:55:08,443
You understand?

1028
00:55:08,477 --> 00:55:09,306
- Hey bozo, you wanna fight?

1029
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:10,168
- Yeah, you want one?

1030
00:55:10,203 --> 00:55:11,515
- I'll ask you first.

1031
00:55:11,549 --> 00:55:14,207
- Why you little!
[laughing]

1032
00:55:14,241 --> 00:55:16,174
- So how do you feel, Miss Taylor?

1033
00:55:16,209 --> 00:55:19,350
- What are your plans for the future?

1034
00:55:19,385 --> 00:55:21,697
- What's the baby's name?

1035
00:55:21,732 --> 00:55:22,457
- Eliza Todd.

1036
00:55:22,491 --> 00:55:24,079
- Oh, then it's a girl.

1037
00:55:24,113 --> 00:55:25,287
- Of course it's a girl.

1038
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,116
The world's not ready
for another Mike Todd.

1039
00:55:27,151 --> 00:55:29,533
[laughing]

1040
00:55:36,678 --> 00:55:37,541
- Action.

1041
00:55:56,249 --> 00:55:57,388
Cut!

1042
00:55:57,423 --> 00:55:58,251
And print.

1043
00:55:58,285 --> 00:56:00,943
[bell ringing]

1044
00:56:02,255 --> 00:56:06,742
- Ah Lizzie, I have to admit
it, you're damn good, you are.

1045
00:56:09,193 --> 00:56:10,056
- Hello.

1046
00:56:11,471 --> 00:56:13,508
- Now who's gonna believe
a story like this?

1047
00:56:13,542 --> 00:56:17,581
What guy's not gonna
fall for a dame like you?

1048
00:56:19,583 --> 00:56:22,033
How's the old back, Lizzie?

1049
00:56:22,068 --> 00:56:22,965
- Not so bad.

1050
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:23,863
Why?

1051
00:56:23,897 --> 00:56:26,555
- I sure do wish we were alone right now.

1052
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:29,109
I love you so much, it hurts.

1053
00:56:33,597 --> 00:56:36,600
[thunder booming]

1054
00:56:41,087 --> 00:56:42,744
- It's not too bad.

1055
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:51,131
- Well it doesn't take
a medical genius to say,

1056
00:56:51,166 --> 00:56:52,132
lady, you are sick!

1057
00:56:52,167 --> 00:56:53,168
104 is sick.

1058
00:56:53,202 --> 00:56:54,894
- I'm flying to New York tonight.

1059
00:56:54,928 --> 00:56:56,102
Medical genius.

1060
00:56:56,136 --> 00:56:57,241
- Nuts, too.

1061
00:56:57,275 --> 00:56:58,345
- Delusional.

1062
00:56:58,380 --> 00:56:59,830
It's the fever.

1063
00:56:59,864 --> 00:57:01,038
- Oh, Mikey Mike.

1064
00:57:01,072 --> 00:57:02,522
My fathead sweetie.

1065
00:57:02,557 --> 00:57:06,112
They're giving you Showman
of the Year tomorrow night.

1066
00:57:06,146 --> 00:57:06,837
- So?

1067
00:57:06,871 --> 00:57:08,494
They'll name me it every year.

1068
00:57:08,528 --> 00:57:10,910
- 1200 people at the Waldorf Astoria.

1069
00:57:10,944 --> 00:57:11,980
- Am I wrong, doc?

1070
00:57:12,014 --> 00:57:14,500
- I'd say there's gonna
be one less than 1200

1071
00:57:14,534 --> 00:57:17,123
at the Waldorf tomorrow night.

1072
00:57:18,296 --> 00:57:21,299
- Hey!
[laughing]

1073
00:57:21,334 --> 00:57:23,854
Hi you guys, Mommy's real sick now.

1074
00:57:23,888 --> 00:57:24,924
[laughing]

1075
00:57:24,958 --> 00:57:26,443
[children shouting]

1076
00:57:26,477 --> 00:57:27,547
- Let's take the puppies,

1077
00:57:27,582 --> 00:57:29,998
and we'll go rustle up some cookies, huh?

1078
00:57:30,032 --> 00:57:31,068
- Say bye to Mommy.

1079
00:57:31,102 --> 00:57:33,173
- I love you, I love you.

1080
00:57:44,737 --> 00:57:47,464
- This is a good angle.

1081
00:57:47,498 --> 00:57:49,845
- For what, a picture about a corpse?

1082
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:52,227
- I'm gonna use it in my next picture.

1083
00:57:52,261 --> 00:57:53,228
- Kiss me.

1084
00:57:53,262 --> 00:57:55,541
- I already did, won't change my mind.

1085
00:57:55,575 --> 00:57:58,613
- Then kiss me for the hell of it.

1086
00:58:01,374 --> 00:58:04,032
- Oh God, you make me so happy.

1087
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:08,864
[thunder booming]

1088
00:58:08,899 --> 00:58:09,555
- Oh, Mike.

1089
00:58:09,589 --> 00:58:10,763
- Don't you worry, sweetie.

1090
00:58:10,797 --> 00:58:13,006
I can fly above any storm.

1091
00:58:13,041 --> 00:58:14,663
I married you, didn't I?

1092
00:58:14,698 --> 00:58:16,458
I'll call you from Tulsa.

1093
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:17,459
- What time?

1094
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,322
- Three AM sharp.

1095
00:58:18,356 --> 00:58:19,185
- Don't forget.

1096
00:58:19,219 --> 00:58:20,289
- Yes, Mummy.

1097
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:28,953
Oh, forgot something!

1098
00:58:28,988 --> 00:58:31,197
[laughing]

1099
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:35,546
I love you.

1100
00:58:35,581 --> 00:58:36,823
- I love you.

1101
00:58:43,934 --> 00:58:45,970
[thunder booming]

1102
00:58:46,005 --> 00:58:49,077
[suspenseful music]

1103
00:59:03,056 --> 00:59:04,023
Doctor?

1104
00:59:04,057 --> 00:59:06,819
This isn't a medical
emergency or anything.

1105
00:59:06,853 --> 00:59:09,131
- Elizabeth, what's wrong?

1106
00:59:10,581 --> 00:59:12,514
- It's after three.

1107
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:13,791
- Tell me.

1108
00:59:13,826 --> 00:59:18,727
- Mike was supposed to
call from Tulsa, by three.

1109
00:59:18,762 --> 00:59:20,764
- Mike can take care of himself.

1110
00:59:20,798 --> 00:59:22,628
- I have this feeling.

1111
00:59:22,662 --> 00:59:25,527
- I can hear you smoking.

1112
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:26,597
- I'm not.

1113
00:59:27,356 --> 00:59:29,496
- Liz, you're sick.

1114
00:59:29,531 --> 00:59:30,705
Go to sleep.

1115
00:59:31,809 --> 00:59:33,570
- When Mike calls.

1116
01:00:12,885 --> 01:00:13,748
No, no!

1117
01:00:15,646 --> 01:00:17,890
[crying]

1118
01:00:22,377 --> 01:00:25,276
- I'm sorry Liz, I'm so sorry.

1119
01:00:25,311 --> 01:00:27,624
Mike, the plane went down.

1120
01:00:28,901 --> 01:00:31,075
There were no survivors.

1121
01:00:31,973 --> 01:00:33,215
- No!

1122
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:34,113
No, God!

1123
01:00:40,567 --> 01:00:41,430
Why?

1124
01:00:48,748 --> 01:00:52,787
[people talking from outside]

1125
01:01:03,142 --> 01:01:05,731
[car honking]

1126
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:07,698
- Eddie.

1127
01:01:20,607 --> 01:01:21,470
- Mike.

1128
01:01:28,339 --> 01:01:29,409
- I'm glad you're here!

1129
01:01:29,444 --> 01:01:31,273
- I got here as fast as I could.

1130
01:01:31,308 --> 01:01:32,136
Is she?

1131
01:01:32,171 --> 01:01:32,999
- Go to her.

1132
01:01:33,034 --> 01:01:33,690
- You think?

1133
01:01:33,724 --> 01:01:35,588
- You're the perfect one.

1134
01:01:35,622 --> 01:01:37,555
Mike loved you so much.

1135
01:01:37,590 --> 01:01:38,729
- You're right.

1136
01:01:38,764 --> 01:01:41,318
Oh, this is a nightmare.

1137
01:01:41,352 --> 01:01:43,492
But, for Mike's sake.

1138
01:01:43,527 --> 01:01:44,908
- For hers too.

1139
01:02:00,026 --> 01:02:00,889
- Eddie.

1140
01:02:23,463 --> 01:02:25,465
You know what I figured out?

1141
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:30,954
Mike and I were married 413 days exactly.

1142
01:02:32,887 --> 01:02:37,201
No one's ever gonna know
how much I loved that man.

1143
01:02:38,271 --> 01:02:39,031
- Me too.

1144
01:02:39,065 --> 01:02:41,102
- You did, didn't you?

1145
01:02:42,206 --> 01:02:44,761
- Did I ever tell you
about the time he said,

1146
01:02:44,795 --> 01:02:47,039
most boys dream of growing up to be

1147
01:02:47,073 --> 01:02:50,456
the president of the United States,

1148
01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:52,009
but not me, he said.

1149
01:02:52,044 --> 01:02:56,358
I dream of growing up and
marrying Elizabeth Taylor.

1150
01:02:59,258 --> 01:03:03,572
- Big, overdressed,
fatass broad. [laughing]

1151
01:03:06,058 --> 01:03:09,716
- You know, when we were
in Europe, Debbie and me,

1152
01:03:09,751 --> 01:03:12,202
and we ran into you and Mike,

1153
01:03:12,236 --> 01:03:15,550
I have to be honest, I was so envious.

1154
01:03:16,723 --> 01:03:17,863
- Of what?

1155
01:03:17,897 --> 01:03:20,072
Our brawls? [laughing]

1156
01:03:20,106 --> 01:03:20,762
- Yeah.

1157
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:23,247
Yeah, you two were so close.

1158
01:03:26,457 --> 01:03:30,945
- I feel like half a pair
of scissors without him.

1159
01:03:34,707 --> 01:03:35,881
- I think,

1160
01:03:35,915 --> 01:03:39,885
Mike would want you to
get on with your life.

1161
01:03:52,759 --> 01:03:54,347
- Gonna invite me in?

1162
01:03:54,382 --> 01:03:56,902
- No, I'll come to you.

1163
01:03:56,936 --> 01:03:59,905
- I didn't get a chance to tell you, but,

1164
01:03:59,939 --> 01:04:03,149
the trouble with people
dying is, it's stupid.

1165
01:04:03,184 --> 01:04:05,703
- That's what Mike would have said.

1166
01:04:05,738 --> 01:04:07,360
Oh Richard, Mike's barely cold

1167
01:04:07,395 --> 01:04:10,398
and all they can think
about is their damn movie.

1168
01:04:10,432 --> 01:04:11,399
- This town.

1169
01:04:11,433 --> 01:04:14,885
I found things to shoot,
shooting around you.

1170
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:15,886
Hey, kid.

1171
01:04:15,921 --> 01:04:18,855
I've been worried about you.

1172
01:04:18,889 --> 01:04:19,925
- Thanks.

1173
01:04:28,588 --> 01:04:29,589
[sighs] Oh, gosh.

1174
01:04:29,624 --> 01:04:33,939
I haven't been on this
lot since I was a child.

1175
01:04:33,973 --> 01:04:35,872
Went to school here.

1176
01:04:37,045 --> 01:04:39,703
I've given MGM my entire life.

1177
01:04:39,737 --> 01:04:42,119
And all they can say is,

1178
01:04:42,154 --> 01:04:45,882
all they want is to stuff me
back into the meat grinder.

1179
01:04:45,916 --> 01:04:47,711
- Hey, I'm with you on this.

1180
01:04:47,745 --> 01:04:48,988
We'll manage.

1181
01:04:50,817 --> 01:04:52,647
- They fired Judy.

1182
01:04:52,681 --> 01:04:54,476
Judy Garland, for God's sake!

1183
01:04:54,511 --> 01:04:58,204
Gable, Tracy, oh, and
they let Garbo sneak away

1184
01:04:58,239 --> 01:05:01,380
without so much as a thank you.

1185
01:05:01,414 --> 01:05:02,243
- Look.

1186
01:05:02,277 --> 01:05:04,590
I don't give a damn about this picture.

1187
01:05:04,624 --> 01:05:05,763
We'll recast.

1188
01:05:05,798 --> 01:05:07,351
You, please, go home.

1189
01:05:07,386 --> 01:05:10,699
It's a movie, for crying out loud!

1190
01:05:10,734 --> 01:05:14,876
- You're one of the few men
in this town who'd say that.

1191
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:17,361
- Yeah, I'm a hell of a guy.

1192
01:05:24,644 --> 01:05:27,509
[emotional music]

1193
01:05:30,271 --> 01:05:34,516
- I think Mike would want
me to get back to work.

1194
01:05:34,551 --> 01:05:38,451
- Well, if that's what you
think Mike would have wanted.

1195
01:05:39,763 --> 01:05:43,905
- I came here today so you
would convince me to come back.

1196
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:47,633
- No, you came here to convince yourself.

1197
01:05:47,667 --> 01:05:50,567
Now get your butt over to wardrobe.

1198
01:05:52,603 --> 01:05:54,364
[dogs barking]

1199
01:05:54,398 --> 01:05:56,573
[laughing]

1200
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:01,819
- Hey, I got your message.

1201
01:06:01,854 --> 01:06:03,407
What's wrong?

1202
01:06:03,442 --> 01:06:04,339
- Oh no, nothing.

1203
01:06:04,374 --> 01:06:07,170
I wanted to give you something.

1204
01:06:11,105 --> 01:06:12,416
It was Mike's.

1205
01:06:16,834 --> 01:06:18,526
- His gold money clip?

1206
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:20,010
Are you sure?

1207
01:06:20,045 --> 01:06:21,011
- Positive.

1208
01:06:21,046 --> 01:06:23,358
Mike loved you like a son.

1209
01:06:26,361 --> 01:06:27,224
Me too.

1210
01:06:32,850 --> 01:06:33,713
Sit down.

1211
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:38,408
- I'd love it if you could come to Vegas,

1212
01:06:38,442 --> 01:06:41,894
to my opening at the Tropicana.

1213
01:06:41,928 --> 01:06:45,001
Or maybe that wouldn't
be such a good idea,

1214
01:06:45,035 --> 01:06:46,692
people might think...

1215
01:06:46,726 --> 01:06:48,625
- Not if Debbie's with you.

1216
01:06:48,659 --> 01:06:49,522
- She hates Vegas.

1217
01:06:49,557 --> 01:06:51,731
She can't stand the guys I hang out with,

1218
01:06:51,766 --> 01:06:53,423
she thinks I gamble too much.

1219
01:06:53,457 --> 01:06:54,631
- Well, you do.

1220
01:06:54,665 --> 01:06:56,702
[laughing]

1221
01:06:56,736 --> 01:06:57,565
- Yeah.

1222
01:06:57,599 --> 01:06:59,049
Is that a crime?

1223
01:06:59,084 --> 01:07:00,809
- Not in Vegas.

1224
01:07:00,844 --> 01:07:02,363
That's the charm.

1225
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:12,200
Eddie, what do you want?

1226
01:07:13,339 --> 01:07:15,514
What do you really want?

1227
01:07:19,794 --> 01:07:21,037
- I want out.

1228
01:07:21,968 --> 01:07:24,419
- And what does Debbie want?

1229
01:07:26,387 --> 01:07:28,975
- She wants the marriage to work.

1230
01:07:29,010 --> 01:07:30,701
- That is a problem.

1231
01:07:31,426 --> 01:07:34,050
- I've got a bigger problem.

1232
01:07:35,016 --> 01:07:37,743
I think I'm falling in love with you.

1233
01:07:37,777 --> 01:07:39,365
I wanna marry you.

1234
01:07:43,473 --> 01:07:44,543
[popping]

1235
01:07:44,577 --> 01:07:46,786
[laughing]

1236
01:07:54,484 --> 01:07:55,623
- Fill her up.

1237
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:03,286
[phone ringing]

1238
01:08:04,114 --> 01:08:05,150
Hello?

1239
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:13,123
- Yeah?

1240
01:08:14,711 --> 01:08:16,092
Deb.

1241
01:08:16,126 --> 01:08:17,162
Debbie.

1242
01:08:18,232 --> 01:08:19,750
How did you know?

1243
01:08:21,994 --> 01:08:22,857
Oh.

1244
01:08:23,892 --> 01:08:26,274
Well that was a good guess.

1245
01:08:28,207 --> 01:08:29,864
Debbie, uh, listen.

1246
01:08:31,831 --> 01:08:33,281
This isn't easy.

1247
01:08:35,283 --> 01:08:39,149
Uh, Elizabeth and I are together here.

1248
01:08:39,184 --> 01:08:41,220
We're in love, Debbie.

1249
01:08:51,299 --> 01:08:52,887
- What did she say?

1250
01:08:54,095 --> 01:08:57,823
- She said, we'd discuss
it, just come home.

1251
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:05,589
- Are you going home, Eddie?

1252
01:09:10,076 --> 01:09:11,733
- God, how could I?

1253
01:09:14,805 --> 01:09:17,877
- Frankly, I'm shocked
such lies would be printed.

1254
01:09:17,912 --> 01:09:19,983
Eddie and Liz are just good friends.

1255
01:09:20,017 --> 01:09:21,364
Now what's wrong with a good friend

1256
01:09:21,398 --> 01:09:23,297
taking another friend out for the evening.

1257
01:09:23,331 --> 01:09:26,162
- Debbie, you do that very well, but,

1258
01:09:26,196 --> 01:09:26,921
this is Hedda.

1259
01:09:26,955 --> 01:09:28,267
Level with me.

1260
01:09:28,302 --> 01:09:32,685
We both know Eddie is not
exactly mister picket fence.

1261
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:34,722
What's really happening?

1262
01:09:37,449 --> 01:09:40,969
- All I'm saying, is Eddie's a great guy.

1263
01:09:43,903 --> 01:09:44,835
I love him.

1264
01:09:47,631 --> 01:09:49,219
Don't blame Eddie.

1265
01:09:50,669 --> 01:09:51,670
- Level with me.

1266
01:09:51,704 --> 01:09:53,499
I'll find out anyway.

1267
01:09:54,707 --> 01:09:57,227
The word is, that they are breaking up

1268
01:09:57,262 --> 01:09:59,056
and you are the cause.

1269
01:09:59,091 --> 01:10:00,230
- That's bull.

1270
01:10:00,265 --> 01:10:01,783
I don't break up marriages.

1271
01:10:01,818 --> 01:10:04,614
Besides, you don't break
up a happy marriage.

1272
01:10:04,648 --> 01:10:07,064
- You cannot hurt Debbie this way

1273
01:10:07,099 --> 01:10:09,274
without hurting yourself more.

1274
01:10:09,308 --> 01:10:12,277
Elizabeth, she truly loves Eddie.

1275
01:10:13,139 --> 01:10:15,314
- He doesn't love her, he never did.

1276
01:10:15,349 --> 01:10:16,798
The marriage was a farce.

1277
01:10:16,833 --> 01:10:19,939
- What do you think Mike
would think about all this?

1278
01:10:19,974 --> 01:10:21,734
- Mike's dead!

1279
01:10:21,769 --> 01:10:22,632
I'm alive.

1280
01:10:26,567 --> 01:10:30,260
What do you expect me to do, sleep alone?

1281
01:10:36,197 --> 01:10:37,992
[phone ringing]

1282
01:10:38,026 --> 01:10:39,476
You viper!

1283
01:10:39,511 --> 01:10:42,583
You depicted me as something
cruel and absolutely heartless!

1284
01:10:42,617 --> 01:10:45,241
- Darling, I only wrote what you told me.

1285
01:10:45,275 --> 01:10:47,864
- I didn't think you'd
print it, for God's sake!

1286
01:10:47,898 --> 01:10:49,866
- Darling, that's my job.

1287
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:53,007
- You betrayed me, Aunt Hedda.

1288
01:10:53,041 --> 01:10:54,595
I will never forgive you.

1289
01:10:54,629 --> 01:10:58,909
- I would imagine Debbie's
singing the same song these days.

1290
01:11:01,947 --> 01:11:03,259
[crashing]

1291
01:11:03,293 --> 01:11:05,675
[clapping]

1292
01:11:06,538 --> 01:11:09,195
Eddie's ruined, of course.

1293
01:11:09,230 --> 01:11:12,509
Hate mail is flowing in like a flood

1294
01:11:12,544 --> 01:11:14,408
in the streets of this town.

1295
01:11:14,442 --> 01:11:16,686
The network's dropped him.

1296
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:21,035
Only that element out in Las
Vegas will hire him any more.

1297
01:11:22,692 --> 01:11:25,729
The man does have a full-time job.

1298
01:11:26,765 --> 01:11:28,698
Full-time Elizabeth.

1299
01:11:28,732 --> 01:11:32,357
But then, you'd know all about
that, wouldn't you, Sarah?

1300
01:11:32,391 --> 01:11:36,430
- I won't say a bad word about Elizabeth.

1301
01:11:36,464 --> 01:11:38,328
But if she had listened to me,

1302
01:11:38,363 --> 01:11:40,123
this never would have happened.

1303
01:11:40,157 --> 01:11:43,713
That Fisher man has taken her
off to Europe for a honeymoon.

1304
01:11:43,747 --> 01:11:47,579
Elizabeth says she
hopes it lasts 40 years.

1305
01:11:48,856 --> 01:11:49,926
- Poor Eddie.

1306
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:59,418
[speaking in foreign language]

1307
01:11:59,453 --> 01:12:01,006
- Do you speak English?

1308
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:05,182
No that's okay, that's
okay, just put it down.

1309
01:12:05,217 --> 01:12:08,393
Very good, very good, that's fine.

1310
01:12:08,427 --> 01:12:11,154
This can go downstairs in storage.

1311
01:12:11,188 --> 01:12:15,123
[speaking in foreign language]

1312
01:12:18,368 --> 01:12:21,060
- Could you order me up a scotch?

1313
01:12:21,095 --> 01:12:22,614
- In a sec, babe.

1314
01:12:26,238 --> 01:12:28,033
[phone ringing]

1315
01:12:28,067 --> 01:12:32,037
- Really, I'm in so much
pain, my back again.

1316
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,525
Are you going to answer that?

1317
01:12:46,292 --> 01:12:48,329
What in God's heaven is this?

1318
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:49,123
- Oh, it's fine.

1319
01:12:49,157 --> 01:12:50,331
Just medicine.

1320
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:52,333
Don't worry, it's all
been prescribed for me

1321
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:53,921
by Dr. Jacobson in New York.

1322
01:12:53,955 --> 01:12:56,475
- Oh Eddie, don't you read the magazines?

1323
01:12:56,510 --> 01:12:57,925
That's Dr. Feelgood!

1324
01:12:57,959 --> 01:12:59,444
He's notorious!

1325
01:12:59,478 --> 01:13:03,206
- It's just vitamins, and
a bunch of other stuff.

1326
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:04,069
- Stuff?

1327
01:13:04,103 --> 01:13:05,277
Damn right, stuff.

1328
01:13:05,311 --> 01:13:07,244
Stuff mixed with amphetamines.

1329
01:13:07,279 --> 01:13:08,625
With all kinds of stuff.

1330
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:10,834
- Yeah, uppers, so what?

1331
01:13:13,458 --> 01:13:15,391
- God, this frightens me, Eddie.

1332
01:13:15,425 --> 01:13:17,289
How long have you been doing this?

1333
01:13:17,323 --> 01:13:19,671
- For a while, it helps me perform.

1334
01:13:19,705 --> 01:13:21,673
What about all the pills you take?

1335
01:13:21,707 --> 01:13:25,987
- Mine are prescribed
but a real doctor, Eddie.

1336
01:13:26,022 --> 01:13:26,885
Come on.

1337
01:13:29,543 --> 01:13:32,442
[phone ringing]

1338
01:13:38,897 --> 01:13:40,243
- Yeah?

1339
01:13:40,277 --> 01:13:42,245
Oh yeah, hi Walter.

1340
01:13:42,279 --> 01:13:43,764
No, I can hear you.

1341
01:13:43,798 --> 01:13:45,731
It sound like you're next door.

1342
01:13:45,766 --> 01:13:48,182
Oh, you're next door to Daryl Zanuck.

1343
01:13:48,216 --> 01:13:49,839
You're in Hollywood.

1344
01:13:49,873 --> 01:13:50,805
Very funny.

1345
01:13:52,393 --> 01:13:53,774
It's Walter Wanger.

1346
01:13:53,808 --> 01:13:55,569
- Oh, it's that Cleopatra thing.

1347
01:13:55,603 --> 01:13:56,846
You talk to him.

1348
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,435
- He says Fox is ready to
go the distance with you.

1349
01:13:59,469 --> 01:14:03,093
- Tell him I'm too young
to go the distance.

1350
01:14:03,128 --> 01:14:04,405
- Walter?

1351
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,889
She's in her room now,

1352
01:14:05,924 --> 01:14:08,582
she's learning French verbs or something.

1353
01:14:08,616 --> 01:14:10,031
But go ahead and I'll write it down.

1354
01:14:10,066 --> 01:14:12,068
- Tell him I'll do it for a million bucks

1355
01:14:12,102 --> 01:14:15,796
against 10 percent of the
gross from the first dollar.

1356
01:14:15,830 --> 01:14:18,315
- No one's gotten a million dollars.

1357
01:14:18,350 --> 01:14:21,008
- Or a percentage of the gross.

1358
01:14:22,354 --> 01:14:24,287
- Well she just stepped in.

1359
01:14:24,321 --> 01:14:26,772
Are you sure you wanna hear?

1360
01:14:27,946 --> 01:14:30,500
She says she'll do it
for a million dollars

1361
01:14:30,535 --> 01:14:32,226
against 10 percent of the gross.

1362
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:33,261
- From the first dollar.

1363
01:14:33,296 --> 01:14:35,194
- From the first dollar.

1364
01:14:35,919 --> 01:14:37,783
All right, Walter.

1365
01:14:39,405 --> 01:14:41,028
- So what'd he say?

1366
01:14:41,062 --> 01:14:41,891
Forget it?

1367
01:14:41,925 --> 01:14:43,237
- No.

1368
01:14:43,271 --> 01:14:45,032
- Then what'd he say?

1369
01:14:46,378 --> 01:14:47,241
- He said,

1370
01:14:48,656 --> 01:14:51,141
I'll get back to you.

1371
01:14:51,176 --> 01:14:53,972
- No! [laughing]

1372
01:15:05,570 --> 01:15:07,641
- Liz, before we can let you go to England

1373
01:15:08,469 --> 01:15:11,783
to play Cleopatra, for one million,

1374
01:15:11,817 --> 01:15:14,855
[laughing] 10 percent of the gross,

1375
01:15:14,889 --> 01:15:17,478
I have to remind you that
you owe us a picture,

1376
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:20,101
and that picture's got
to be Butterfield 8.

1377
01:15:20,136 --> 01:15:21,240
- That is outrageous!

1378
01:15:21,275 --> 01:15:23,173
- I'm afraid it means that
you're gonna have to do

1379
01:15:23,208 --> 01:15:26,591
Butterfield 8 for considerable
less compensation.

1380
01:15:26,625 --> 01:15:28,627
- You're asking me to play a whore.

1381
01:15:28,662 --> 01:15:31,043
- That word does not
appear in our screenplay.

1382
01:15:31,078 --> 01:15:33,632
And I want to remind
you that Butterfield 8

1383
01:15:33,667 --> 01:15:36,152
is a bestselling novel by a renowned

1384
01:15:36,186 --> 01:15:38,361
and respected American author.

1385
01:15:38,395 --> 01:15:39,500
- I don't care!

1386
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:42,192
I won't do it, under any circumstance.

1387
01:15:42,227 --> 01:15:45,886
- Well, if you refuse to abide
by the terms of our contract,

1388
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:48,958
I'm afraid it leaves us
no choice but to block you

1389
01:15:48,992 --> 01:15:51,961
from working anywhere
for the next two years.

1390
01:15:51,995 --> 01:15:55,758
- And this is how you choose
to end an 18-year relationship.

1391
01:15:55,792 --> 01:16:00,417
- Liz, sentiment went out
of this business years ago.

1392
01:16:00,452 --> 01:16:02,178
Adjust! I've had to.

1393
01:16:02,212 --> 01:16:03,835
Oh yes, but that's the business.

1394
01:16:03,869 --> 01:16:07,010
Personally, me, I'm still
a very sentimental guy.

1395
01:16:07,045 --> 01:16:09,875
I remember the luck we
made with National Velvet,

1396
01:16:09,910 --> 01:16:12,878
and that horse, that
beautiful horse, King Charles,

1397
01:16:12,913 --> 01:16:15,363
that you loved so much.

1398
01:16:15,398 --> 01:16:16,986
- Thanks a lot, you SOB.

1399
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:21,128
I'm still paying for the
feed on that damn nag!

1400
01:16:27,065 --> 01:16:28,584
- Liz! Elizabeth!

1401
01:16:31,172 --> 01:16:32,518
Don't do this to me.

1402
01:16:32,553 --> 01:16:35,763
- You can make me do it, but
you can't make me act in it.

1403
01:16:35,798 --> 01:16:38,041
I'll be unprepared, I'll be late.

1404
01:16:38,076 --> 01:16:41,010
- I think you're too much
the professional for that.

1405
01:16:41,044 --> 01:16:42,390
- In a pig's eye.

1406
01:16:57,923 --> 01:16:59,545
But I want Eddie there.

1407
01:16:59,580 --> 01:17:00,685
- Well of course.

1408
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:03,170
- To play the role of Steve.

1409
01:17:03,204 --> 01:17:04,171
- What?

1410
01:17:04,205 --> 01:17:05,206
He's a singer!

1411
01:17:05,241 --> 01:17:06,380
- Singing is acting.

1412
01:17:06,414 --> 01:17:09,555
He's acted in front of
hundreds, thousands of people.

1413
01:17:09,590 --> 01:17:11,937
He's perfect for the role.

1414
01:17:11,972 --> 01:17:14,077
Do this for me, please.

1415
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:36,410
You really are mad at me this morning.

1416
01:17:36,444 --> 01:17:38,101
- Put your coat on!

1417
01:17:40,586 --> 01:17:41,933
- Why this morning?

1418
01:17:43,175 --> 01:17:45,937
- Because I'm sick of opening
this door every other day

1419
01:17:45,971 --> 01:17:49,941
and finding you burned
out, boozed up, and...

1420
01:17:52,598 --> 01:17:55,118
Burned out, boozed up, and...

1421
01:17:56,568 --> 01:17:57,396
Sorry, baby.

1422
01:17:58,466 --> 01:18:00,641
- [sighs] Eddie, you're not even trying.

1423
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:02,747
We broke early so that you could rehearse.

1424
01:18:02,781 --> 01:18:03,609
- I am trying!

1425
01:18:03,644 --> 01:18:04,990
I never said I was an actor.

1426
01:18:05,025 --> 01:18:06,164
- No, I did.

1427
01:18:06,198 --> 01:18:08,822
And what this hateful film
doesn't destroy, you will.

1428
01:18:08,856 --> 01:18:10,962
I staked my reputation on you.

1429
01:18:10,996 --> 01:18:12,377
- Did I ask for this?

1430
01:18:12,411 --> 01:18:14,275
Did I ever ask to be in this?

1431
01:18:14,310 --> 01:18:15,518
- No, you don't ask.

1432
01:18:15,552 --> 01:18:19,073
You just sit around waiting
for Mama to make it better.

1433
01:18:19,108 --> 01:18:19,971
- Hey hey hey.

1434
01:18:20,005 --> 01:18:22,456
Come on you two, you don't wanna do this.

1435
01:18:22,490 --> 01:18:23,319
- I do.

1436
01:18:23,353 --> 01:18:24,458
I want to kill something.

1437
01:18:24,492 --> 01:18:25,873
- No no, Bessie Mae.

1438
01:18:25,908 --> 01:18:29,981
Come on, go get dressed, we
have reservations at eight.

1439
01:18:30,015 --> 01:18:30,878
Go on.

1440
01:18:32,915 --> 01:18:34,433
Eddie, come here.

1441
01:18:35,952 --> 01:18:38,265
It's all right, come here.

1442
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:41,268
Now look, you can't just say the words.

1443
01:18:41,302 --> 01:18:42,303
- You're telling me.

1444
01:18:42,338 --> 01:18:45,203
- No no, I mean you gotta
feel past the words.

1445
01:18:45,237 --> 01:18:49,000
They're nothing, an envelope, maybe.

1446
01:18:49,034 --> 01:18:52,279
The message comes from here, the gut.

1447
01:18:54,384 --> 01:18:55,454
- Sure.

1448
01:18:55,489 --> 01:18:57,525
- Okay, over here, come on.

1449
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:58,941
This guy Steve.

1450
01:18:59,976 --> 01:19:02,565
He looks at this woman, he's had her.

1451
01:19:02,599 --> 01:19:03,773
Right?

1452
01:19:03,808 --> 01:19:06,914
And he looks at her and
he sees filth, dirt.

1453
01:19:06,949 --> 01:19:10,815
You have to look at
Elizabeth and see filth.

1454
01:19:10,849 --> 01:19:12,333
- But I love her.

1455
01:19:12,368 --> 01:19:13,231
- Now.

1456
01:19:13,265 --> 01:19:16,199
Now come on, pal, you can do it, come on.

1457
01:19:16,234 --> 01:19:19,478
Come on, from the gut, you can do it.

1458
01:19:25,864 --> 01:19:29,834
- I'm sick of opening that door every.

1459
01:19:29,868 --> 01:19:31,697
I'm sick of...

1460
01:19:31,732 --> 01:19:34,459
Let me walk, I'm better walking.

1461
01:19:40,845 --> 01:19:42,536
I'm sick of opening that door every day

1462
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:45,435
and finding you boozed
out, burned up, and ugly.

1463
01:19:45,470 --> 01:19:47,852
Boozed out, burned up, and ugly.

1464
01:19:47,886 --> 01:19:49,198
I'm sick of...

1465
01:19:55,825 --> 01:19:58,414
[dog barking]

1466
01:20:41,975 --> 01:20:44,287
- God, not more hate mail.

1467
01:20:44,322 --> 01:20:48,360
- Fox is on my back about
delays on Cleopatra.

1468
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:51,294
They're way over budget.

1469
01:20:53,710 --> 01:20:54,573
Baby?

1470
01:20:57,128 --> 01:20:57,922
- What?

1471
01:20:57,956 --> 01:20:59,337
I'm sick, okay?

1472
01:21:01,615 --> 01:21:04,860
- I don't know how much
of this I can take.

1473
01:21:04,894 --> 01:21:06,344
- What about me?

1474
01:21:07,103 --> 01:21:09,347
- Everything is stalled here.

1475
01:21:09,381 --> 01:21:11,004
I have no career!

1476
01:21:11,038 --> 01:21:12,798
You're too sick to work.

1477
01:21:12,833 --> 01:21:13,799
Even if you could,

1478
01:21:13,834 --> 01:21:16,043
the rain won't stop.
[coughing]

1479
01:21:16,078 --> 01:21:19,875
This town is like living in
the bottom of a damn well.

1480
01:21:19,909 --> 01:21:21,738
- I hate it too, Eddie.

1481
01:21:21,773 --> 01:21:23,154
- Maybe I should go back

1482
01:21:23,188 --> 01:21:25,535
and try and get some work, something.

1483
01:21:25,570 --> 01:21:26,985
- Now don't start that again.

1484
01:21:27,020 --> 01:21:30,195
- I said I'm just thinking about it.

1485
01:21:31,403 --> 01:21:34,510
- I'll tell you what I think about.

1486
01:21:43,174 --> 01:21:46,349
Every man I've ever known has either

1487
01:21:48,075 --> 01:21:50,043
died or abandoned me.

1488
01:21:58,810 --> 01:22:01,054
[crying]

1489
01:22:04,816 --> 01:22:07,681
[dramatic music]

1490
01:22:17,622 --> 01:22:19,313
- Oh my God.

1491
01:22:19,348 --> 01:22:20,728
Help!

1492
01:22:20,763 --> 01:22:22,006
Someone help!

1493
01:22:23,421 --> 01:22:25,561
[gasping]

1494
01:22:30,911 --> 01:22:31,877
What is it?

1495
01:22:31,912 --> 01:22:32,878
- Congestion.

1496
01:22:32,913 --> 01:22:35,226
She's not getting any air.

1497
01:22:53,830 --> 01:22:55,901
- Can you believe this?

1498
01:22:55,936 --> 01:22:58,249
Tons of letters and telegrams.

1499
01:22:58,283 --> 01:23:01,459
And look here, here's your obituary.

1500
01:23:02,356 --> 01:23:03,185
- I saw.

1501
01:23:05,014 --> 01:23:06,982
- Everyone loves you.

1502
01:23:08,086 --> 01:23:10,330
- Everyone loves me dead.

1503
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:14,920
Alive, I'm the whore of Babylon.

1504
01:23:14,955 --> 01:23:16,405
- No babe, they love you.

1505
01:23:16,439 --> 01:23:19,753
The fans, they forgive you everything.

1506
01:23:21,237 --> 01:23:23,377
- I'll let them know when I have.

1507
01:23:23,412 --> 01:23:26,587
- Now is that any way to get better?

1508
01:23:29,487 --> 01:23:31,696
[knocking]

1509
01:23:35,907 --> 01:23:36,735
- Mummy.

1510
01:23:36,770 --> 01:23:38,427
I've missed you so.

1511
01:23:39,945 --> 01:23:40,808
Daddy.

1512
01:23:48,954 --> 01:23:49,783
Mummy.

1513
01:23:49,817 --> 01:23:51,405
I saw Mike, I did.

1514
01:23:52,544 --> 01:23:53,338
- Where, baby?

1515
01:23:53,373 --> 01:23:55,616
- When I died, I saw him.

1516
01:24:00,414 --> 01:24:03,383
I wanted so badly to be with him.

1517
01:24:04,867 --> 01:24:06,248
But he said no.

1518
01:24:07,835 --> 01:24:09,147
No, you can't.

1519
01:24:10,079 --> 01:24:11,736
It's not your time.

1520
01:24:13,703 --> 01:24:14,566
Go back.

1521
01:24:16,016 --> 01:24:17,052
Back.

1522
01:24:18,777 --> 01:24:20,365
- Did he, darling?

1523
01:24:22,609 --> 01:24:24,266
- Fight to go back.

1524
01:24:25,750 --> 01:24:27,476
That's what he said.

1525
01:24:28,925 --> 01:24:30,651
I'll be here.

1526
01:24:30,686 --> 01:24:31,756
He said that.

1527
01:24:32,791 --> 01:24:33,861
I'll be here.

1528
01:24:37,002 --> 01:24:39,867
[people chanting]

1529
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:44,286
- Can you hear that, hun?

1530
01:24:45,045 --> 01:24:47,703
Would you get a load of that?

1531
01:24:47,737 --> 01:24:50,602
[people cheering]

1532
01:25:03,443 --> 01:25:05,410
- Burt Lancaster wins his Oscar

1533
01:25:05,445 --> 01:25:09,034
against an outstanding
field of movie favorites.

1534
01:25:09,069 --> 01:25:11,485
The distinguished audience is hushed.

1535
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:13,729
The tension is great when to Yul Brynner

1536
01:25:13,763 --> 01:25:18,251
falls the assignment of
telling who is Best Actress.

1537
01:25:19,079 --> 01:25:20,563
- Elizabeth Taylor.

1538
01:25:20,598 --> 01:25:21,633
[clapping]

1539
01:25:21,668 --> 01:25:23,980
- Escorted by her husband, Eddie Fisher,

1540
01:25:24,015 --> 01:25:26,431
the star who was honored for her portrayal

1541
01:25:26,466 --> 01:25:30,470
in MGM's Butterfield 8 comes
up to receive the Oscar.

1542
01:25:30,504 --> 01:25:34,094
A pleasure indeed, for Elizabeth
Taylor has won a victory

1543
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:36,924
over a near-fatal illness.

1544
01:25:36,959 --> 01:25:39,272
And this too is her fourth consecutive try

1545
01:25:39,306 --> 01:25:40,894
at winning an Oscar.

1546
01:25:40,928 --> 01:25:42,999
And now it is hers at last.

1547
01:25:43,034 --> 01:25:47,521
She is overcome with emotion
as the presentation is made.

1548
01:25:55,633 --> 01:25:56,461
- Oh.

1549
01:25:58,670 --> 01:26:00,327
I don't really know

1550
01:26:01,156 --> 01:26:03,537
how to express my gratitude

1551
01:26:04,262 --> 01:26:06,920
for this after everything.

1552
01:26:06,954 --> 01:26:10,372
I guess all I can do is say thank you.

1553
01:26:10,406 --> 01:26:12,926
Thank you, with all my heart.

1554
01:26:14,790 --> 01:26:16,654
[clapping]

1555
01:26:16,688 --> 01:26:19,967
- Academy Awards, a reminder
that every moviegoer

1556
01:26:20,002 --> 01:26:21,797
is also a star maker.

1557
01:26:27,837 --> 01:26:29,322
- Butterfield 8.

1558
01:26:29,356 --> 01:26:31,255
- Congratulations.

1559
01:26:31,289 --> 01:26:33,395
I'm so happy for you.

1560
01:26:33,429 --> 01:26:37,192
Now, would you like some more good news?

1561
01:26:37,226 --> 01:26:38,400
- Yes.

1562
01:26:38,434 --> 01:26:40,298
- We're gonna start up
again with Cleopatra.

1563
01:26:40,333 --> 01:26:42,058
Only this time we're going to Rome.

1564
01:26:42,093 --> 01:26:44,440
We're going to pretend that Rome is Rome.

1565
01:26:44,475 --> 01:26:48,030
And here's the kicker, Joe
Mankiewicz said he would direct.

1566
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:50,170
- Oh Walter, that's wonderful.

1567
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:52,103
- But he wants to recast the men.

1568
01:26:52,137 --> 01:26:54,519
Only English actors, the cream.

1569
01:26:54,554 --> 01:26:56,832
- Rex Harrison, of course.

1570
01:26:56,866 --> 01:26:57,971
- For Caesar, yes.

1571
01:26:58,005 --> 01:27:00,145
A real actor, a man of the field.

1572
01:27:00,180 --> 01:27:02,907
- And Antony, who will play Antony?

1573
01:27:02,941 --> 01:27:04,357
- You're gonna love this.

1574
01:27:04,391 --> 01:27:06,669
The best, the new Olivier.

1575
01:27:06,704 --> 01:27:08,223
- Who?

1576
01:27:08,257 --> 01:27:09,776
- Richard Burton.

1577
01:27:11,502 --> 01:27:12,365
- Who?

1578
01:27:13,193 --> 01:27:16,990
[dramatic orchestral music]

1579
01:27:54,959 --> 01:27:56,029
- Hmm, what's that line again?

1580
01:27:56,063 --> 01:27:57,030
- I need to--

1581
01:27:57,064 --> 01:27:57,893
- Heard it.

1582
01:27:57,927 --> 01:28:00,654
[group murmurs]

1583
01:28:02,104 --> 01:28:05,107
[water pours]

1584
01:28:05,141 --> 01:28:06,073
- Please, will you stop fiddling.

1585
01:28:06,108 --> 01:28:07,696
- I'm trying to fix it, Mr Burton.

1586
01:28:07,730 --> 01:28:09,249
- Ah hail,

1587
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:10,215
Encuador!

1588
01:28:10,250 --> 01:28:11,734
- What's in the cup, Richard?

1589
01:28:11,769 --> 01:28:14,116
- Oh, I've grappled with the grape,

1590
01:28:14,150 --> 01:28:16,291
and now I'm grounding with the beans.

1591
01:28:16,325 --> 01:28:17,671
- Well, lucky it's not nitroglycerin

1592
01:28:17,706 --> 01:28:19,535
with your hand shaking like that.

1593
01:28:19,570 --> 01:28:20,398
- Ah.

1594
01:28:20,433 --> 01:28:21,537
Well Joe, when in Rome, one has to

1595
01:28:21,572 --> 01:28:24,126
celebrate the local gods, I ...

1596
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:25,265
Late last night, I know,

1597
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:27,854
but it's all in honor of Bacchus,

1598
01:28:27,888 --> 01:28:29,165
the sweet God of Wine.

1599
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:30,512
- Call sheet, Mr Mankiewicz.

1600
01:28:30,546 --> 01:28:32,514
- And none for the little
boy who lives down the lane?

1601
01:28:32,548 --> 01:28:35,068
- Oh, goodness, I thought
I gave you one, Mr Burton.

1602
01:28:35,102 --> 01:28:36,000
- Oh really?

1603
01:28:36,034 --> 01:28:36,932
We must do it again then sometime.

1604
01:28:36,966 --> 01:28:39,141
- Sheila, please see if Miss Taylor's ready.

1605
01:28:39,175 --> 01:28:40,729
- I told her twice.

1606
01:28:40,763 --> 01:28:43,145
- Well tell her I said get her butt out here.

1607
01:28:43,179 --> 01:28:44,802
- Just like that, Mr Mankiewicz?

1608
01:28:44,836 --> 01:28:46,217
- Yes.

1609
01:28:46,251 --> 01:28:49,531
But tell her I said it
with enormous charm.

1610
01:28:49,565 --> 01:28:51,947
- That strumpet will be late
for bloody Judgment Day.

1611
01:28:51,981 --> 01:28:54,467
- I hope you can curb your
tongue around Elizabeth.

1612
01:28:54,501 --> 01:28:56,158
- My tongue's as tame as a geldy.

1613

- You have a long summer ahead.

1614
01:28:57,987 --> 01:29:01,750

said that she's all ...

1615

Breasts?

1616
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:06,064
No legs, and the voice of a fish wife?

[men shout]

1618
01:29:09,689 --> 01:29:10,690
- Hmm.

1619
01:29:10,724 --> 01:29:11,587
Well ...

1620
01:29:12,899 --> 01:29:14,763
- Fish wife and Queen.

1621
01:29:17,524 --> 01:29:18,905
- Your majesty!

1622
01:29:21,873 --> 01:29:23,875
Has anyone ever told you

1623
01:29:25,049 --> 01:29:27,534
what a pretty girl you are?

1624
01:29:27,569 --> 01:29:31,089
- Why no, you're the very first!

1625
01:29:31,124 --> 01:29:33,506
Better stick to the dialogue.

1626
01:29:34,369 --> 01:29:36,094
- The thing that motivates these two,

1627
01:29:36,129 --> 01:29:38,062
they both needed Caesar.

1628
01:29:38,096 --> 01:29:40,271
But he's dead, so to keep the power,

1629
01:29:40,305 --> 01:29:42,100
she hooks into the new guy.

1630
01:29:42,135 --> 01:29:43,826
But the hook gets her too.

1631
01:29:43,861 --> 01:29:45,587
For the first time in her life,

1632
01:29:45,621 --> 01:29:49,798
Cleopatra falls deeply
and passionately in love.

1633
01:29:51,524 --> 01:29:52,628
- But she ...

1634
01:29:52,663 --> 01:29:55,113
She loved Caesar, yes?

1635
01:29:55,148 --> 01:29:56,321
- No, not like this.

1636
01:29:56,356 --> 01:29:57,633
This is mutual.

the cat gets the mouse,

01:29:59,601 --> 01:30:01,361
and the mouse gets the cat,

1639
01:30:01,396 --> 01:30:03,225
and they both go under.

1640
01:30:03,259 --> 01:30:04,744
No survivors.

1641
01:30:04,778 --> 01:30:07,056
- Well that's a chilling thought.

1642
01:30:07,091 --> 01:30:08,161
- Yes,

1643
01:30:08,195 --> 01:30:10,232
we must beware, my lady.

1644
01:30:10,266 --> 01:30:11,613
You can't act falling in love

1645
01:30:11,647 --> 01:30:14,270
without actually falling in love,

1646
01:30:14,305 --> 01:30:16,100
if it's deliberate.

1647
01:30:16,134 --> 01:30:16,859
- Not me.

1648
01:30:16,894 --> 01:30:18,102
Maybe a few schoolgirl crushes,

1649

but you'll notice I never
marry my leading man.

1650

- I didn't say marriage, I said love.

1651

- Well I'm an old-fashioned
girl Mr Burton,

1652
01:30:25,489 --> 01:30:27,352
just like Mummy raised me.

1653
01:30:27,387 --> 01:30:29,769
First I love, then I marry.

1654
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:31,943
- She says,

1655
01:30:32,772 --> 01:30:36,292
she's an old-fashioned girl, Walter.

1656
01:30:36,327 --> 01:30:37,949
Whatever that means.

1657
01:30:37,984 --> 01:30:40,504
Okay, let's see what this looks like!

1658
01:30:40,538 --> 01:30:42,195

1665
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:52,516

Joe, give us a moment.

Are you all right?

or the early morning, can't figure out

1670

which one of them got to me.

What you've done.

I see how you conquer.

tomorrow, my Empress.

you go home to your wife and
get a good night's sleep?

Yes, good idea.

01:31:42,324 --> 01:31:43,014
- You started it.

1688
01:31:43,049 --> 01:31:43,394
- No, you did.

1689
01:31:43,428 --> 01:31:44,706
- You did.

1690
01:31:44,740 --> 01:31:46,742
- Why don't you just try
and turn up sober tomorrow?

1691
01:31:46,777 --> 01:31:49,020
- I'll turn up sober
if you turn up on time.

01:43:59,474 --> 01:44:00,751
You were rather a bit
of a mess this morning

1979
01:44:00,786 --> 01:44:03,064
when you came in, weren't you, old girl?

1980
01:44:03,098 --> 01:44:05,929
- You look like something
the cat dragged in, old boy.

1981
01:44:05,963 --> 01:44:06,826
- Yes, I was hungover.

1982
01:44:06,861 --> 01:44:09,070
A little too much of the vine last night.

1983
01:44:09,104 --> 01:44:09,967
- Me too.

1984
01:44:11,624 --> 01:44:12,487
Pure love.

1985
01:44:13,764 --> 01:44:14,903
And 100 proof.

1986
01:44:15,801 --> 01:44:16,595
[kisses]

1987
01:44:16,629 --> 01:44:17,803
- Ocean, you deceive yourself.

1988
01:44:17,837 --> 01:44:18,942
That was never love.

1989
01:44:18,976 --> 01:44:19,977
- No?

1990
01:44:20,012 --> 01:44:21,116
- No.

1991
01:44:21,151 --> 01:44:22,394
It was lust.

1992
01:44:22,428 --> 01:44:24,154
- Love, you bloated old goat!

1993
01:44:24,188 --> 01:44:24,948
Love!

1994
01:44:24,982 --> 01:44:26,121
- You silly trollop!

1995
01:44:26,156 --> 01:44:28,434
- I see you need some
coaching on the finer points.

1996
01:44:28,469 --> 01:44:30,333
- It's my blunt point that you admire.

1997
01:44:30,367 --> 01:44:31,472
- [laughs]

1998
01:44:31,506 --> 01:44:32,783
You bloody coward!

1999
01:44:32,818 --> 01:44:33,646
- You ...

2000
01:44:33,681 --> 01:44:34,337
- Coward!

2001
01:44:34,371 --> 01:44:35,199
- You scurrilous slag!

2002
01:44:35,234 --> 01:44:38,202
- [laughs]

2003
01:44:38,237 --> 01:44:39,273
- Joe.

2004
01:44:41,551 --> 01:44:42,068
- Don't.

2005
01:44:42,103 --> 01:44:43,242
- I'm--

2006
01:44:43,277 --> 01:44:44,278
- You were going to
remind me that I've been

2007
01:44:44,312 --> 01:44:45,520
sitting here for 40 minutes,

2008
01:44:45,555 --> 01:44:47,695
and I don't want to be reminded.

2009
01:44:47,729 --> 01:44:48,592
- Oh good.

2010
01:44:57,567 --> 01:44:59,845
- What in hell were they up to?

2011
01:44:59,879 --> 01:45:02,123
- They were rehearsing the love scenes.

2012
01:45:02,157 --> 01:45:04,401
Everything but the lines.

2013
01:45:05,747 --> 01:45:07,231
- All right, places everybody!

2014
01:45:07,266 --> 01:45:09,233
- Elizabeth, you look radiant, my darling!

2015
01:45:09,268 --> 01:45:10,442
Mmm.

2016
01:45:10,476 --> 01:45:12,858
The sunshine of our day!

2017
01:45:12,892 --> 01:45:13,859
Come, let me show you.

2018
01:45:13,893 --> 01:45:14,722
Richard?

Eddie?

2027
01:45:59,387 --> 01:46:00,354
We're about to sit down,

2028
01:46:00,388 --> 01:46:01,872
what's going on?

2029
01:46:01,907 --> 01:46:03,046
- Socks.

2030
01:46:03,080 --> 01:46:03,943
Underwear.

2031
01:46:04,634 --> 01:46:06,463
- Eddie, stop this!

2032
01:46:07,257 --> 01:46:08,569
- Look,

2033
01:46:08,603 --> 01:46:10,674
I'm not going away for good,
so don't go nuts, okay?

2034
01:46:10,709 --> 01:46:13,021
- Of course you're not,
there's too much going on!

2035
01:46:13,056 --> 01:46:15,645
Eddie, I'm in the middle
of a picture, I need you.

2036
01:46:15,679 --> 01:46:16,646
- I'm taking off for a few days,

2037
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:18,268
I'm going up to Switzerland.

2038
01:46:18,302 --> 01:46:19,718
I'm gonna go get a chalet.

2039
01:46:19,752 --> 01:46:22,065
Do you remember, a chalet?

2040
01:46:23,238 --> 01:46:24,101
Our dream.

2041
01:46:25,413 --> 01:46:27,967
- Eddie, you can't do this.

2042
01:46:28,002 --> 01:46:28,658
- Why not?

2043
01:46:28,692 --> 01:46:29,521
You've got people here.

2044
01:46:29,555 --> 01:46:30,418
You've got Richard.

2045
01:46:30,453 --> 01:46:31,833
- He has his own wife!

2046
01:46:31,868 --> 01:46:34,422
- Somebody told me I should
buy a gun and shoot the guy!

2047
01:46:34,457 --> 01:46:35,492
- Oh, stop it!

2048
01:46:35,527 --> 01:46:36,493
- You think there's a judge in this would

2049
01:46:36,528 --> 01:46:37,287
that would convict me?

2050
01:46:37,321 --> 01:46:38,219
Especially in Italy!

2051
01:46:38,253 --> 01:46:39,496
Here, you know what they would do?

2052
01:46:39,531 --> 01:46:41,015
Hell, they would stand
up and they'd applaud!

2053
01:46:41,049 --> 01:46:42,154
They would have a parade!

2054
01:46:42,188 --> 01:46:43,017
- Eddie, listen.

2055
01:46:43,051 --> 01:46:44,570

- Ah, good evening Sir,

2060
01:46:56,686 --> 01:46:58,895
did you know that the verb, to be,

2061
01:46:58,929 --> 01:47:01,863
is the most brilliant verb
in the English language?

2062
01:47:01,898 --> 01:47:03,796
I am ...

2063
01:47:03,831 --> 01:47:05,108
You are!

2064
01:47:05,142 --> 01:47:06,005

2068
01:47:13,116 --> 01:47:14,082

2069
01:47:14,117 --> 01:47:15,187
[laughs]

2070
01:47:15,221 --> 01:47:16,947
- We were just about to sit down.

2071
01:47:16,982 --> 01:47:19,467
- What's he doing here?

2072
01:47:19,502 --> 01:47:21,365
What are you doing here?

2073
01:47:21,400 --> 01:47:22,781
- I am in love!

2074
01:47:24,990 --> 01:47:26,060
With this girl.

2075
01:47:26,094 --> 01:47:28,027
- You have your own girl.

2076
01:47:28,062 --> 01:47:29,201
You have Sybil.

2077
01:47:29,235 --> 01:47:30,098
- Sybil.

2078

are both my girls.

Yeah, she is.

2094
01:48:40,548 --> 01:48:41,584
Yes, I am.

2095
01:48:42,930 --> 01:48:46,312
Yes, well I do know one thing.

2096
01:48:46,347 --> 01:48:48,280
Will you let me speak!?

2097
01:48:49,212 --> 01:48:50,075
Thank you.

2098
01:48:51,179 --> 01:48:52,180
I know that,

2099
01:48:53,699 --> 01:48:54,942
that it will soon be dawn,

2100
01:48:54,976 --> 01:48:57,082
and in that harsh light,
my thoughts will clear

2101
01:48:57,116 --> 01:49:00,223
and I will, I will rescue my Guinevere,

2102
01:49:00,257 --> 01:49:02,984
I will do the right thing, I ...

- I have to.

2107

- You don't have to.

2108
01:49:16,446 --> 01:49:17,896
You want to?

2109
01:49:17,930 --> 01:49:19,587

What do you wanna do?

2112
01:49:23,660 --> 01:49:25,869
- I want to love you.

2113
01:49:25,904 --> 01:49:27,491
You said you wanted to
get more out of life,

2114
01:49:27,526 --> 01:49:29,183
and that's what we've got.

2115

We are more!

2116
01:49:30,322 --> 01:49:31,565
- What we get in life, Elizabeth,

2117
01:49:31,599 --> 01:49:33,014
is that we get to love a little,

2118
01:49:33,049 --> 01:49:35,430
just a little, and then
we get to die, a lot.

2119
01:49:35,465 --> 01:49:36,570
- I don't want to die!

2120

- Richard.

2123
01:49:43,197 --> 01:49:46,234
- Oh, I thought I could get away with it.

2124
01:49:46,269 --> 01:49:47,615
- With what?

2125
01:49:47,650 --> 01:49:48,754
- With you.

2126
01:49:50,273 --> 01:49:51,999
I'm drowning in you.

2127
01:49:54,242 --> 01:49:55,658

- Yes I am.

2131
01:50:08,705 --> 01:50:09,844
- Damn you, Richard.

How dare you run away from me,

2133
01:50:11,397 --> 01:50:13,158
I've given up everything for you!

2134
01:50:13,192 --> 01:50:15,643
I've made a spectacle
out of myself for you!

2135
01:50:15,678 --> 01:50:16,402
- For me?

2136
01:50:16,437 --> 01:50:17,334
- Yes!

2137
01:50:17,369 --> 01:50:18,819

on the Elizabeth Taylor merry-go-round,

2139
01:50:20,890 --> 01:50:23,996
and I expect that you always shall.

[slaps]

2141
01:50:28,829 --> 01:50:31,348
At least until your looks go.

- Oh, Mick.

2153

thrilled, I should mention.

2155

Where's Eddie?

Some time now.

2158

- Ah yes.

2159
01:51:43,662 --> 01:51:45,491
I'd forgotten.

2160
01:51:45,526 --> 01:51:48,460
I'd forget my head if it wasn't ...

Did you see this?

2163

It's from the Vatican newspaper.

2164
01:51:55,122 --> 01:51:59,367
I didn't even know the
Pope had a newspaper.

2165
01:51:59,402 --> 01:52:02,405
No-one's gonna tell me
who I can and cannot love.

2166
01:52:02,439 --> 01:52:03,475
- Ah.

2167
01:52:03,509 --> 01:52:04,545
Ignore it.

2168
01:52:04,579 --> 01:52:05,546

- It ain't flattering.

2172

2173
01:52:12,070 --> 01:52:13,692
I mean, I love my children!

2174

I'm a wonderful mother.

2177

2178
01:52:21,942 --> 01:52:24,945
I've gotta wire my lawyers,
I can't let that happen.

You just concentrate on giving
your feet back under you.

finish this picture.

the kids back to London.

- Escaia, what is that,
that's an island, isn't it?

2199
01:53:08,574 --> 01:53:11,405
What a break that would
be, the sea, the salt air.

2200
01:53:11,439 --> 01:53:12,475
- And the moonlight.

- Oh yes, this is a little emerald broach

2218
01:53:54,828 --> 01:53:56,450
Richard bought me at Bulgarry.

Never.

2224
01:54:03,526 --> 01:54:05,735
- Then what's the deal?

not sure I should share this with you,

2227
01:54:08,772 --> 01:54:10,015
it's such a private thought,

2228
01:54:10,050 --> 01:54:13,156
but sometimes the heart
speaks and you have to.

2229
01:54:13,191 --> 01:54:14,778
I always believed that I
was a child of destiny.

If that's true,

2231
01:54:16,919 --> 01:54:20,094

01:54:47,673 --> 01:54:48,951
do I want to be a household name

02:08:05,229 --> 02:08:06,955
How did she take it?

2525
02:08:08,991 --> 02:08:10,613
Sybil, what did she say?

2526
02:08:10,648 --> 02:08:11,753
- Not much.

2527
02:08:13,202 --> 02:08:14,238
- You told her?

2528
02:08:14,272 --> 02:08:15,135
- No.

2529
02:08:16,102 --> 02:08:17,241
[laughs]

2530
02:08:17,275 --> 02:08:18,138
Oh.

2531
02:08:20,106 --> 02:08:24,144
No reproaches, no rampage,
no threats of death

2532
02:08:25,870 --> 02:08:28,355
and destruction, Richard you fool,

2533
02:08:28,390 --> 02:08:32,049
Richard you lout, you
worm, you insipid ...

2534
02:08:32,083 --> 02:08:34,637
[groans]

2535
02:08:34,672 --> 02:08:36,501
Where the hell you think you're going?

2536
02:08:36,536 --> 02:08:37,917
- I'm going to my room,

2537
02:08:37,951 --> 02:08:39,504
and you're going home to Sybil.

2538
02:08:39,539 --> 02:08:40,609
- To hell I am.

2539
02:08:40,643 --> 02:08:42,024
I'm coming through that door.

2540
02:08:42,059 --> 02:08:44,268
- Well, you better bring a locksmith.

2541
02:08:44,302 --> 02:08:48,341
- You can't toss me out
like some errant schoolboy!

2542
02:08:48,375 --> 02:08:50,619
- Richard, you can have
a wife and a mistress,

2543
02:08:50,653 --> 02:08:53,656
you cannot have a wife and a fiance.

2544
02:08:53,691 --> 02:08:54,692
- Why not?

2545
02:08:54,727 --> 02:08:55,658
- Because,

2546
02:08:55,693 --> 02:08:57,074
I'm the fiance.

2547
02:09:00,111 --> 02:09:01,630
[door slams]

2548
02:09:01,664 --> 02:09:02,942
- You think just because I'm drunk

2549
02:09:02,976 --> 02:09:05,116
I'm not gonna remember any
of this in the morning,

2550
02:09:05,151 --> 02:09:06,014
you cow!

2551
02:09:07,291 --> 02:09:09,327
[yells]

2552
02:09:09,362 --> 02:09:10,225
You sow!

[sighs]

2557
02:09:40,703 --> 02:09:42,291
Sybil, hello love.

2558
02:09:43,776 --> 02:09:47,055
Yes, yes, I know it's rather late.

2559
02:09:47,089 --> 02:09:51,404
Well, it's early actually [laughs].

2560
02:09:51,438 --> 02:09:53,578
No, no, I didn't tell her.

2561
02:09:55,028 --> 02:09:57,203
Well, the thing is love,

2562
02:09:58,273 --> 02:10:01,966
I do believe I'm going to need a divorce.

2563
02:10:09,802 --> 02:10:12,977
[puts phone down]

2564
02:10:13,012 --> 02:10:15,497

[crowd yells]

2567
02:10:20,329 --> 02:10:23,194
- This is like being
swallowed up by an avalanche.

2568
02:10:23,229 --> 02:10:25,334
- Yes, every night the same thing,

2569
02:10:25,369 --> 02:10:26,888
more of these ...

2570
02:10:28,199 --> 02:10:28,993
- Vultures!

2571
02:10:29,028 --> 02:10:30,823
- No fans, love, fans.

2572
02:10:30,857 --> 02:10:32,997
All come to see me, me.

2573
02:10:33,032 --> 02:10:34,447
- Love, they come to see us,

2574
02:10:34,481 --> 02:10:36,759
we're a pair of circus freaks.

2575
02:10:36,794 --> 02:10:38,175
Well it's true, the
only reason they're here

2576
02:10:38,209 --> 02:10:40,142
is to see sinners on display.

2577
02:10:40,177 --> 02:10:43,974
[crowd cheers and applaud]

2578
02:10:58,712 --> 02:11:01,439
[crowd applaud]

2579
02:11:17,386 --> 02:11:19,078
- That man is a child of the theater.

2580
02:11:19,112 --> 02:11:21,839
- Mmm, just a natural chic bea.

2581
02:11:21,874 --> 02:11:24,048
It's where he belongs.

2582
02:11:24,083 --> 02:11:26,119
- You wouldn't mind if he stayed?

2583
02:11:26,154 --> 02:11:29,122
- I just want to be with Richard.

2584
02:11:31,055 --> 02:11:33,333
- Congratulations.

2585
02:11:33,368 --> 02:11:36,095
[crowd applaud]

2586
02:11:47,900 --> 02:11:49,177
- Thank you.

2587
02:11:49,211 --> 02:11:51,800
You're such a kind audience,

2588
02:11:51,834 --> 02:11:53,422
all of you.

2589
02:11:53,457 --> 02:11:54,320
However,

2590
02:11:55,355 --> 02:11:58,531
my heart feels either appreciations,

2591
02:11:59,773 --> 02:12:02,500
I have at last married the girl.

2592
02:12:05,020 --> 02:12:08,161
[crowd applaud]

2593
02:12:08,196 --> 02:12:11,233
And indeed, she is such a treasure

2594
02:12:12,579 --> 02:12:14,443
that I must honor her.

2595
02:12:15,479 --> 02:12:18,068
[crowd cheer]

2596
02:12:18,827 --> 02:12:19,690
My bride.

2597
02:12:24,005 --> 02:12:26,007
You see, they love us.

2598
02:12:26,835 --> 02:12:28,423
- Mmm, please don't turn your back,

2599
02:12:28,457 --> 02:12:32,945
they love the lions as much
as they love the Christians.

2600
02:12:35,844 --> 02:12:37,708
- Ladies and gentlemen,

2601
02:12:37,742 --> 02:12:40,193
as the bard would have it,

2602
02:12:40,228 --> 02:12:43,610
we will have no more marriages.

2603
02:12:43,645 --> 02:12:45,509
[laughs]

2604
02:12:45,543 --> 02:12:48,270
[crowd applaud]

2605
02:12:54,656 --> 02:12:55,588
[birds tweet]

2606
02:12:55,622 --> 02:12:57,866
- So you've both
undergone a lot of changes

2607
02:12:57,900 --> 02:12:59,972
to play in Virginia Woolf.

2608
02:13:00,006 --> 02:13:01,283
- You'd be sure and tell your readers,

2609
02:13:01,318 --> 02:13:03,699
this is part me, part foam.

2610
02:13:03,734 --> 02:13:05,978
I gained 15 pounds in 15 years,

2611
02:13:06,012 --> 02:13:09,084
and the first time the
studio insisted on it.

2612
02:13:09,119 --> 02:13:11,880
- You ever feel like
you've become this woman?

2613
02:13:11,914 --> 02:13:13,192
- Only on the set.

2614
02:13:14,400 --> 02:13:17,610
Richard doesn't let me use
four letter words at home.

2615
02:13:17,644 --> 02:13:19,336
- Yes, I've cured Elizabeth of

2616
02:13:19,370 --> 02:13:21,683
that rather unfortunate tendency.

2617
02:13:21,717 --> 02:13:23,133
- You bet your ass.

2618
02:13:23,167 --> 02:13:25,687
- That's a three letter word.

2619
02:13:27,723 --> 02:13:29,829
Of course my only concern
is that my quality

2620
02:13:29,863 --> 02:13:33,212
is not exactly this American professor

2621
02:13:33,246 --> 02:13:35,766
I've gone to see, he's not ...

2622
02:13:35,800 --> 02:13:36,974
- Rich?

2623
02:13:37,009 --> 02:13:39,632
- He's not me, this moon-faced chap,

2624
02:13:39,666 --> 02:13:41,979
beaten down by a woman.

2625
02:13:42,014 --> 02:13:43,049
- Richard!

2626
02:13:51,057 --> 02:13:52,817
- Thank you, Mr Burton.

2627
02:13:52,852 --> 02:13:55,165
[Richard mumbles]

2628
02:13:55,199 --> 02:13:56,614
- You're mumbling!

2629
02:13:56,649 --> 02:13:58,892
- I'm running my lines.

2630
02:13:58,927 --> 02:13:59,652
- Mumbler!

2631
02:14:00,756 --> 02:14:03,276
- One of your less glaring
defects, Elizabeth,

2632
02:14:03,311 --> 02:14:05,244
is you've never been able to distinguish

2633
02:14:05,278 --> 02:14:07,453
between art and mumbles.

2634
02:14:09,386 --> 02:14:10,421
- Can too.

2635
02:14:10,456 --> 02:14:11,802
You're a mumbler!

2636
02:14:12,699 --> 02:14:14,460
Accurate lines?

2637
02:14:14,494 --> 02:14:18,360
- Page four, it says,
George takes the bottle,

2638
02:14:18,395 --> 02:14:19,258
and pours.

2639
02:14:19,844 --> 02:14:21,087
[pours]

2640
02:14:21,122 --> 02:14:22,364
- Don't you think you've
rehearsed that one enough?

2641
02:14:22,399 --> 02:14:23,710
- Oh, it's method, darling.

2642
02:14:23,745 --> 02:14:26,506
You see, I'm sending my way
into the role of a drunk.

2643
02:14:26,541 --> 02:14:28,301
- Hah, for years!

2644
02:14:28,336 --> 02:14:30,338
- You see, that hurts.

2645
02:14:30,372 --> 02:14:32,616
I have a reason to drink.

2646
02:14:46,595 --> 02:14:48,218
- Page 27, Martha takes a chicken leg

2647
02:14:48,252 --> 02:14:50,944
from the refrigerator, it's in the script.

2648
02:14:50,979 --> 02:14:52,843
- Haha, I've never have for the life of me

2649
02:14:52,877 --> 02:14:55,328
understood your attraction
to those poor birds.

2650
02:14:55,363 --> 02:14:56,536
- Really?

2651
02:14:56,571 --> 02:14:58,780
Well listen, buster, maybe
that's one of your defects,

2652
02:14:58,814 --> 02:15:00,885
in a big, fat glaring way too!

2653
02:15:00,920 --> 02:15:02,922
- Why don't you swallow first?

2654
02:15:02,956 --> 02:15:04,441
- All your nutrients come in bottles.

2655
02:15:04,475 --> 02:15:06,063
You know, you oughta try food sometime.

2656
02:15:06,098 --> 02:15:08,065
- Oh, it's all of God's poor little birds

2657
02:15:08,100 --> 02:15:09,756
that I'm concerned for,

2658
02:15:09,791 --> 02:15:11,551
they seem naked and vulnerable.

2659
02:15:11,586 --> 02:15:12,483
- Oh, brother.

2660
02:15:12,518 --> 02:15:14,036
- Have you ever considered that you should

2661
02:15:14,071 --> 02:15:16,556
eat only what you can kill?

2662
02:15:16,591 --> 02:15:17,937
- I've considered your snapping

2663
02:15:17,971 --> 02:15:19,801
your fat little Welsh neck!

2664
02:15:19,835 --> 02:15:20,629
- Give me vegetables myself.

2665
02:15:20,664 --> 02:15:23,080
For instance, the hops, or the juniper

2666
02:15:23,115 --> 02:15:24,323
one finds in gin.

2667
02:15:24,357 --> 02:15:24,875
The--

2668
02:15:24,909 --> 02:15:26,187
- Blah, blah, blah.

2669
02:15:26,221 --> 02:15:30,156
- Take to the Russians
take to the magic of vodka.

2670
02:15:30,191 --> 02:15:32,193
I'm a vegetarian.

2671
02:15:32,227 --> 02:15:34,574
- I'm speechless.

2672
02:15:34,609 --> 02:15:35,541
- Oh, I hope not,

2673
02:15:35,575 --> 02:15:37,370
I'd miss your voice, my little dove.

2674
02:15:37,405 --> 02:15:39,200
- You'd be thrilled.

2675
02:15:39,234 --> 02:15:41,305
- No so, like the sailor, I take comfort

2676
02:15:41,340 --> 02:15:45,654
there off into misty distant
hooting of your little horn.

2677
02:15:47,415 --> 02:15:49,486
[laughs]

2678
02:15:51,798 --> 02:15:53,524
- Bullseye!

2679
02:15:53,559 --> 02:15:55,354
[laughs]

2680
02:15:55,388 --> 02:15:57,218
- I am prepared to sacrifice many things

2681
02:15:57,252 --> 02:16:00,635
for our relationship, Elizabeth,

2682
02:16:00,669 --> 02:16:02,154
but to my dignity ...

2683
02:16:02,188 --> 02:16:03,672
- Oh, dignity?

2684
02:16:03,707 --> 02:16:04,501
- No.

2685
02:16:04,535 --> 02:16:05,674
- Dickie's little dignity.

2686
02:16:05,709 --> 02:16:06,744
- That's enough.

2687
02:16:06,779 --> 02:16:08,125
- Yes, you gave up dignity
you popped the cork

2688
02:16:08,160 --> 02:16:09,540
on that bottle!

2689
02:16:10,507 --> 02:16:11,370
Pop!

2690
02:16:11,404 --> 02:16:13,889
What a shot, a shot heard round the world!

2691
02:16:13,924 --> 02:16:16,029
Dickie's popped his little cork!

2692
02:16:16,064 --> 02:16:17,376
Pop, pop, pop!

2693
02:16:18,170 --> 02:16:19,205
Pop!

[laughs]

2695
02:16:21,794 --> 02:16:23,554
- Snap, snap, snap,

2696
02:16:23,589 --> 02:16:25,694
you little viper!

2697
02:16:25,729 --> 02:16:26,971
- Stop it!

2698
02:16:27,006 --> 02:16:27,869
- Oh!

2699
02:16:30,216 --> 02:16:31,286
You missed.

2700
02:16:31,321 --> 02:16:32,839
Come on, come on.

02:16:44,126 --> 02:16:47,716
This is the hymn of chicken, hmm?

2705
02:16:47,751 --> 02:16:49,822
- I don't like our games.

2706
02:16:51,272 --> 02:16:53,239
I hate our games.

2707

[cries]

2708
02:16:55,103 --> 02:16:56,829
- Don't be sad, hmm?

2709
02:16:59,935 --> 02:17:01,247
- I'm not sad.

2710
02:17:05,044 --> 02:17:06,218
I feel lost.

2711
02:17:19,334 --> 02:17:20,956
[door opens]

2712
02:17:20,991 --> 02:17:22,095
- What on Earth?

2713
02:17:22,130 --> 02:17:24,650
Will you stop that dawdling!?

2714
02:17:25,789 --> 02:17:26,928
Come on!

takes me, it's like getting
dressed five times over again,

2719
02:17:32,761 --> 02:17:34,246
not like you.

2720
02:17:34,280 --> 02:17:36,006
These pantyhose.

2721
02:17:36,040 --> 02:17:38,353
- Madam, may I remind thee

2722
02:17:38,388 --> 02:17:41,080
that I am thy husband and thy Lord,

2723
02:17:41,114 --> 02:17:42,081
thy life?

[kisses]

2725
02:17:43,185 --> 02:17:46,085
And like frumpet, thy ...

2726
02:17:46,119 --> 02:17:47,259
- Thy pain in the ass.

2727
02:17:47,293 --> 02:17:48,950
- Oh, yes indeed.

2728
02:17:48,984 --> 02:17:49,847
Come!

02:17:51,677 --> 02:17:52,540
Ah.

2730
02:17:55,543 --> 02:17:57,717
Elizabeth, it's for you.

2731
02:18:01,065 --> 02:18:03,516
I feel a cocktail coming on.

2732
02:18:10,696 --> 02:18:12,180
Elizabeth?

2733
02:18:12,214 --> 02:18:13,319
What is it?

2734
02:18:14,976 --> 02:18:16,011

2736
02:18:17,047 --> 02:18:18,290
Monty's dead!

2737
02:18:26,470 --> 02:18:27,713
- Let him go.

2738
02:18:29,231 --> 02:18:31,095
He was a broken heart.

2739
02:18:32,062 --> 02:18:34,513
Nobody could have saved him.

2740
02:18:36,342 --> 02:18:38,482
[emotional music]

2741
02:18:38,517 --> 02:18:40,967
- We were too busy being us.

2742
02:18:45,040 --> 02:18:46,766
I'd forgotten Monty.

2743
02:18:48,837 --> 02:18:51,599
- He fell in love, you were married,

2744
02:18:51,633 --> 02:18:54,567
he never expected anything from you.

2745
02:18:54,602 --> 02:18:55,879

2746
02:18:55,913 --> 02:18:56,845

Reflections in a golden eye.

2748
02:19:04,543 --> 02:19:09,306

could tell everything to.

2749
02:19:09,341 --> 02:19:12,896
Even things that were very private.

2750
02:19:12,930 --> 02:19:14,035
- He loved you.

[cries]

2752
02:19:19,868 --> 02:19:20,835

[laughs]

2754
02:19:23,078 --> 02:19:24,666
He left Bessy May.

2755
02:19:32,985 --> 02:19:34,262
God, I had many proposals,

2756
02:19:34,296 --> 02:19:38,749
but he was the only man I
should have asked to marry me.

2757
02:19:41,269 --> 02:19:42,788
- Is that a fact?

2758
02:19:45,618 --> 02:19:47,724
Was it a drug overdose?

2759
02:19:51,831 --> 02:19:52,970
- A life over.

2760
02:19:54,247 --> 02:19:56,353

Miss Anne Baxter.

2766
02:20:04,499 --> 02:20:05,673
- They just gave you an Oscar,

2767
02:20:05,707 --> 02:20:08,123
and you're complaining.

2768
02:20:08,158 --> 02:20:09,504
- I'm not complaining for me,

2769
02:20:09,539 --> 02:20:11,057
I'm complaining for you.

2770
02:20:11,092 --> 02:20:12,300
- Oh, I'm a chronic complainer,

2771
02:20:12,334 --> 02:20:13,888
I don't need help.

2772
02:20:14,992 --> 02:20:16,753
- Damn, this is your
fifth nomination, Richard.

2773
02:20:16,787 --> 02:20:19,100
You deserve the Oscar, not me.

2774
02:20:19,134 --> 02:20:19,687
- Shh.

2775
02:20:20,757 --> 02:20:24,657
We've named the yacht
after our three girls,

Kate, Liza and Maria,

2777

- Oh.

2781
02:20:39,845 --> 02:20:40,915
It's quaintly comforting that

2782
02:20:40,949 --> 02:20:44,643
a mere yacht can make you happy, my love.

Where are you going?

People are coming, we're gonna celebrate.

I'm taking a launch to
pick some of my mates.

your crowning achievement.

- Hmm.

2797
02:21:20,955 --> 02:21:21,852
I was just asking.

2798
02:21:21,887 --> 02:21:22,888
- No you weren't.

2799
02:21:22,922 --> 02:21:24,959
You were concerned about
whether I was going to

2800
02:21:24,993 --> 02:21:27,271
fall off the wagon that
I've been clinging to

2801
02:21:27,306 --> 02:21:29,722
so desperately for the last 13 days,

2802
02:21:29,757 --> 02:21:32,242
and well, don't worry love,

2803

You don't even look--

2838
02:23:10,133 --> 02:23:12,411
- Well, how about my being
a Grandmother last year?

2839
02:23:12,445 --> 02:23:13,446
Would you believe it?

2840
02:23:13,481 --> 02:23:14,551
- I refuse to believe it.

2845
02:23:19,142 --> 02:23:21,351
who would allow Richard
to put on this shindig

2846
02:23:21,385 --> 02:23:22,559
here in Budapest?

2847
02:23:22,594 --> 02:23:25,389
But to fly in all these guests?

2848
02:23:25,424 --> 02:23:26,736
- Well Mother, we have to,

2849
02:23:26,770 --> 02:23:28,530
because he's shooting Bluebeard here,

2850
02:23:28,565 --> 02:23:30,153
and with eight wives, I don't want him

your old stage stories.

Hmm, give the old Vic a break, will you?

- Oh.

have to see this up close.

- Yes, that's the way we like it, love.

2880

- The most vulgar thing I've ever seen.

2887
02:24:34,182 --> 02:24:36,633
[laughs]

2888
02:24:36,668 --> 02:24:38,255
- Would you like to try it on?

2889
02:24:38,290 --> 02:24:39,153
- Oh ...

2890
02:24:43,882 --> 02:24:48,127
- Well, doesn't look
so vulgar now, does it?

2891
02:24:48,162 --> 02:24:50,233
[laughs]

2892
02:24:57,827 --> 02:25:00,795
[traffic passes]

2893
02:25:01,693 --> 02:25:03,453
[door buzzes]

2894
02:25:03,487 --> 02:25:04,972
- Darling?

2895
02:25:05,006 --> 02:25:08,113
The scribbler is here from the whatever,

2896
02:25:08,147 --> 02:25:12,186
that journal, the cinematic magazine.

2897
02:25:12,220 --> 02:25:13,428
I'll handle it!

2898
02:25:15,258 --> 02:25:16,224
Ah--

2899
02:25:16,259 --> 02:25:17,087
- Mr Burton!

2900
02:25:17,122 --> 02:25:18,019
- Yes, Mr Durham.

2901
02:25:18,054 --> 02:25:18,848
- Durlam.

2902
02:25:18,882 --> 02:25:20,539
- Oh, whatever, it's nice to meet you.

2903
02:25:20,573 --> 02:25:21,713
Sit down.

2904
02:25:21,747 --> 02:25:22,955
- I'm extremely grateful--

2905
02:25:22,990 --> 02:25:26,856
- Sad to see that my beloved is ill today.

2906
02:25:26,890 --> 02:25:28,340
- I'm sorry, maybe I should come back.

2907
02:25:28,374 --> 02:25:29,375
- Oh, nothing serious,

2908
02:25:29,410 --> 02:25:31,550
we just think it's German measles.

2909
02:25:31,584 --> 02:25:33,034
- You're joking.

2910
02:25:34,242 --> 02:25:36,072
- She'll be up in a day.

2911
02:25:36,106 --> 02:25:37,936
We've prescribed her Italian vodka.

2912
02:25:37,970 --> 02:25:41,249
Quite remarkable, tastes like a paragoric.

2913
02:25:41,284 --> 02:25:43,665
[thunder rolls]

2914
02:25:43,700 --> 02:25:44,736
Go ahead.

2915
02:25:45,633 --> 02:25:46,496
- Sir.

2916
02:25:47,393 --> 02:25:48,222
- Your interview.

2917
02:25:48,256 --> 02:25:49,119
- Oh, yes.

2918
02:25:50,672 --> 02:25:51,812
- I hope you haven't come prepared to ask

2919
02:25:51,846 --> 02:25:55,539
us about the recent
flops we've been having.

2920
02:25:56,713 --> 02:25:58,542
- Richard, I can hear you!

2921
02:25:58,577 --> 02:25:59,785
- Yes.

2922
02:25:59,820 --> 02:26:02,546
We've only had four
flops in a row, actually,

2923
02:26:02,581 --> 02:26:05,342
but some of them had merit, small merit.

2924
02:26:05,377 --> 02:26:07,586
- I'm sure this gentleman
would prefer to come back

2925
02:26:07,620 --> 02:26:08,690
when it isn't raining.

2926
02:26:08,725 --> 02:26:09,726
- Not so.

2927
02:26:09,761 --> 02:26:12,039
He's a veritable duck.

2928
02:26:12,073 --> 02:26:13,005
Hmm?

2929
02:26:13,040 --> 02:26:14,904
You don't mind the rain, do you?

2930
02:26:14,938 --> 02:26:16,043
- Not at all.

2931
02:26:16,077 --> 02:26:17,320
- When it isn't raining,

2932
02:26:17,354 --> 02:26:20,599
perhaps you'll have
sunnier things to say, hmm?

2933
02:26:20,633 --> 02:26:22,083
- Hmm, yes, yes.

2934
02:26:27,675 --> 02:26:30,851
[church bell rings]

2935
02:26:35,648 --> 02:26:37,167
You're racing.

2936
02:26:37,202 --> 02:26:38,617
- We're crawling.

2937
02:26:38,651 --> 02:26:39,791
- I've always been of the opinion

2938
02:26:39,825 --> 02:26:42,517
that mother nature, like
one's mother in law,

2939
02:26:42,552 --> 02:26:45,486
should be visited, but sparingly.

2940
02:26:45,520 --> 02:26:48,454
- It's the drink that wears you out.

2941
02:26:48,489 --> 02:26:50,146
And the cigarettes.

2942
02:26:51,699 --> 02:26:54,667
- It's arthritis actually.

2943
02:26:54,702 --> 02:26:57,360
It reminds me, medication time.

2944
02:26:58,499 --> 02:27:01,122
- Oh Richard, I worry about you.

2945
02:27:01,157 --> 02:27:03,366
- Me too, that's why I drink.

2946
02:27:03,400 --> 02:27:04,988
[wind howls]

2947
02:27:05,023 --> 02:27:06,990
- You really regret
taking a few days here?

2948
02:27:07,025 --> 02:27:11,063
I mean, look around, the
chalet, the mountains ...

2949
02:27:11,098 --> 02:27:12,996
Did you ever believe you'd
have a life like this?

2950
02:27:13,031 --> 02:27:14,756
- Oh yes, this is
precisely the kind of life

2951
02:27:14,791 --> 02:27:16,448
I thought we'd be having.

2952
02:27:16,482 --> 02:27:20,210
Apart from our occasional
trip to this snow palace,

2953
02:27:20,245 --> 02:27:24,870
we have a life of hotel
rooms and rented houses,

2954
02:27:24,905 --> 02:27:27,045
and, oh yes, that yacht,

2955
02:27:27,079 --> 02:27:29,841
that luxuriously
appointed floating prison.

2956
02:27:29,875 --> 02:27:31,981
- I don't like your tone, Richard.

2957
02:27:32,015 --> 02:27:33,051
- It's a life,

2958
02:27:33,085 --> 02:27:34,915
or a half life, actually.

2959
02:27:34,949 --> 02:27:36,709
And to make up for the missing half,

2960
02:27:36,744 --> 02:27:38,539
I drink twice as much.

2961
02:27:38,573 --> 02:27:40,644
- Oh stop it, Richard.

2962
02:27:40,679 --> 02:27:43,233
- Oh, I'll stop, I'll die of drink,

2963
02:27:44,372 --> 02:27:48,549
and you shall go on
blithely in your half world.

2964
02:27:49,343 --> 02:27:51,793
- Do you have to say these things?

2965
02:27:51,828 --> 02:27:53,623
I mean, I know you think them,

2966
02:27:53,657 --> 02:27:55,487
but must you say them?

2967
02:27:55,521 --> 02:27:56,453
Constantly?

2968
02:28:00,872 --> 02:28:03,460
[plane flies]

2969
02:28:06,981 --> 02:28:08,293
Are you going to hold up?

2970
02:28:08,327 --> 02:28:09,501
- I'll hold up.

2971
02:28:09,535 --> 02:28:11,503
Bloody Marys'll hold me up.

2972
02:28:11,537 --> 02:28:14,264
Bob, two large Bloody Mary's.

2973
02:28:14,299 --> 02:28:15,162
- Okay.

2974
02:28:15,196 --> 02:28:16,197
- I hate to leave you,

2975
02:28:16,232 --> 02:28:17,750
New York is dreadful this time of year.

2976
02:28:17,785 --> 02:28:18,855
- Oh.

2977
02:28:18,890 --> 02:28:22,169
You go off to the coast, I'll be fine.

2978
02:28:22,203 --> 02:28:25,966
It's always dreadful out there anyway.

2979
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:29,970
Always open season if you like small game.

2980
02:28:30,004 --> 02:28:31,523
- We haven't gone off on our separate ways

2981
02:28:31,557 --> 02:28:32,938
in a long time.

2982
02:28:34,767 --> 02:28:35,596
We're doing the right thing?

2983
02:28:35,630 --> 02:28:36,838
- [laughs]

2984
02:28:36,873 --> 02:28:40,808
It's been a long time since
we've done the right thing.

2985
02:28:40,842 --> 02:28:42,154
- Richard!

2986
02:28:42,189 --> 02:28:42,844
[laughs]

2987
02:28:42,879 --> 02:28:45,640
- Doing the right thing.

2988
02:28:45,675 --> 02:28:46,538
Huh.

2989
02:28:48,264 --> 02:28:50,714
It's like seeming and being.

2990
02:28:52,130 --> 02:28:53,717
Being and seeming.

2991
02:28:54,787 --> 02:28:56,651
The Dick and Liz Show.

2992
02:28:58,136 --> 02:29:01,070
We're like Laurel and Hardy.

2993
02:29:01,104 --> 02:29:04,038
- I've always been fond
of Lauren and Hardy.

2994
02:29:04,073 --> 02:29:05,695
- Oh yes, well we're not as cute,

2995
02:29:05,729 --> 02:29:06,730
not anymore.

2996
02:29:09,112 --> 02:29:11,804
Everybody's sick to death
of us, especially me.

[phone rings]

2998
02:29:12,874 --> 02:29:14,773
Especially me.

2999
02:29:14,807 --> 02:29:15,670
I know.

3000
02:29:16,671 --> 02:29:18,466
We need, new writers.

3001
02:29:19,778 --> 02:29:21,021
- Premier airlines, flight two,

3002
02:29:21,055 --> 02:29:22,505
two lost--

3003
02:29:22,539 --> 02:29:24,921
- That's my last plane.

3004
02:29:24,956 --> 02:29:26,923
- Miss Taylor, we'll escort you.

3005
02:29:26,958 --> 02:29:28,166
- You've been waiting for an hour.

3006
02:29:28,200 --> 02:29:31,100
Just so they know that it's you.

3007
02:29:34,034 --> 02:29:35,483
- Goodbye Daffy.

3008
02:29:39,073 --> 02:29:40,109
- Bye bye.

3009
02:29:48,738 --> 02:29:50,602
- Would you give this to the press?

3010
02:29:50,636 --> 02:29:52,121
[phone rings]

3011
02:29:52,155 --> 02:29:55,124
[slow sad music]

3012
02:29:56,125 --> 02:29:57,816
- Like this?

3013
02:29:57,850 --> 02:29:59,093
To the press?

3014
02:30:00,163 --> 02:30:02,269
- I just can't face him.

3015
02:30:02,303 --> 02:30:03,477
[cries]

3016
02:30:03,511 --> 02:30:06,031
I am convinced it would be
a good and constructive idea

3017
02:30:06,066 --> 02:30:09,690
if Richard and I were
separated for a while.

3018
02:30:09,724 --> 02:30:12,279
Maybe we loved each other too much.

3019
02:30:12,313 --> 02:30:15,489
I never believed such
a thing was possible.

3020
02:30:15,523 --> 02:30:18,250
But we have been in each
other's pockets constantly,

3021
02:30:18,285 --> 02:30:21,943
never being apart but for
matters of life and death.

3022
02:30:21,978 --> 02:30:23,221
I believe with all my heart

3023
02:30:23,255 --> 02:30:24,774
that the separation will ultimately

3024
02:30:24,808 --> 02:30:29,606
bring us back to where we
should be, and that's together.

3025
02:30:29,641 --> 02:30:32,713
It's just while during
this difficult time.

3026
02:30:32,747 --> 02:30:33,748
Pray for us.

- Evening.

3032
02:31:07,610 --> 02:31:09,025
I'm your date tonight.

3033
02:31:09,060 --> 02:31:10,751
- Oh, then you must be John Warner.

3034
02:31:10,785 --> 02:31:13,305
- Yes ma'am, there's no
question who you are.

3035
02:31:13,340 --> 02:31:14,548
- Oh, call me Elizabeth.

3036
02:31:14,582 --> 02:31:17,689
Well, I can't even remember a time,

3037
02:31:17,723 --> 02:31:19,691
I must have been a teenager

3038
02:31:19,725 --> 02:31:21,658
when I had my last blind date.

3039
02:31:21,693 --> 02:31:22,521
[laughs]

3040
02:31:22,556 --> 02:31:23,902
- Well we're all awfully grateful over

3041
02:31:23,936 --> 02:31:25,110
at the bicentennial committee

3042
02:31:25,145 --> 02:31:26,491
that you agreed to attend
our little ball here

3043
02:31:26,525 --> 02:31:27,561
in Washington.

3044
02:31:27,595 --> 02:31:31,737
- Well, consider it my patriotic duty.

3045
02:31:31,772 --> 02:31:33,498
So tell me about yourself.

3046
02:31:33,532 --> 02:31:35,051
- Well there's not much to tell.

3047
02:31:35,086 --> 02:31:36,570
I'm a Virginian, I got a farm down there,

3048
02:31:36,604 --> 02:31:38,365
I work in the government, and one day

3049
02:31:38,399 --> 02:31:39,849
I plan to run for Senator.

3050
02:31:39,883 --> 02:31:40,884
- Oh.

3051
02:31:40,919 --> 02:31:41,920
You have a farm?

3052
02:31:41,954 --> 02:31:42,886
- Yes ma'am.

3053
02:31:42,921 --> 02:31:43,922
- And you have animals?

3054
02:31:43,956 --> 02:31:44,923
- You betcha.

3055
02:31:44,957 --> 02:31:46,683

It's so beautiful.

02:32:15,781 --> 02:32:20,407
- It's nice of you coming
all the way out here with me.

3062
02:32:20,441 --> 02:32:22,271
- This is my childhood.

3063
02:32:22,305 --> 02:32:26,516
Really, I feel like I'm back in England.

3064
02:32:26,551 --> 02:32:27,517
- You like it?

3065
02:32:27,552 --> 02:32:28,760
- Mhmm,

3066
02:32:28,794 --> 02:32:29,657
yes.

3067
02:32:31,694 --> 02:32:35,249
Have you ever instantly fallen in love?

3068
02:32:36,147 --> 02:32:37,389
With a place.

3069
02:32:39,357 --> 02:32:42,532
- Tell me about yourself, Elizabeth.

3070
02:32:43,913 --> 02:32:47,158
- I'm still reeling from my
second divorce from Richard.

3071
02:32:47,192 --> 02:32:48,159
Richard Burton.

3072
02:32:48,193 --> 02:32:49,919
- Yes, I know who he is.

3073
02:32:49,953 --> 02:32:51,058
- Oh, you've met him?

3074
02:32:51,092 --> 02:32:52,197
- No.

3075
02:32:52,232 --> 02:32:54,061
But I've read about him.

3076
02:32:54,095 --> 02:32:55,787
Like everyone else in America.

02:32:58,376 --> 02:32:59,687
- Well, for a change,

3079
02:32:59,722 --> 02:33:02,000
what you've read in the
papers is pretty much true.

3080
02:33:02,034 --> 02:33:04,485
I've had five husbands and five divorces.

3081
02:33:04,520 --> 02:33:07,005
- Sounds a little discouraging.

3082
02:33:07,039 --> 02:33:08,109
- Hmm.

3083
02:33:08,144 --> 02:33:09,180
Well ...

3084
02:33:11,009 --> 02:33:13,425

I'm John Warner and I'm looking
to be your next senator!

Now what do you say to
Republican fat cats?

3097
02:34:20,181 --> 02:34:21,631
- I wish you wouldn't say that.

3098
02:34:21,666 --> 02:34:22,667
- Oh God, I haven't even met them,

3099
02:34:22,701 --> 02:34:24,220
I've already said something wrong?

3100

in the enemy party.

3113
02:35:01,602 --> 02:35:03,673
I want you all to know how at home

3114
02:35:03,708 --> 02:35:06,504
I feel here in the Old Dominion.

3115
02:35:06,538 --> 02:35:10,128

way for quite some time.

- That sort of get-up
might go in California,

3119
02:35:17,411 --> 02:35:18,861
but here in Virginia, we have something

3120
02:35:18,895 --> 02:35:20,587
we like to call taste.

3121
02:35:20,621 --> 02:35:22,382
- It doesn't bother John.

3122
02:35:22,416 --> 02:35:24,004
- The more attention that lady gets,

3123
02:35:24,038 --> 02:35:26,524
the closer he is to the senate.

3124

that women have made to this country,

3127
02:35:32,115 --> 02:35:33,703
but we cannot ask the fairer sex

3128
02:35:33,738 --> 02:35:35,947
to go into combat, that is not acceptable

3129
02:35:35,981 --> 02:35:37,569

- And any so called equal rights amendment

3132
02:35:41,849 --> 02:35:44,231
that would put a woman in harm's way,

3133
02:35:44,265 --> 02:35:46,440
that cannot be condoned.

and to ask them to face
the harshest reality

3137
02:35:54,345 --> 02:35:57,865
of modern existence, we can't do that.

02:36:00,316 --> 02:36:01,904
- What, Elizabeth?

3140
02:36:02,974 --> 02:36:04,355
- Don't women have been
facing the harshest

the beginning of time?

I just don't see how you can ...

02:42:39,957 --> 02:42:41,372
- Well there's a real problem,

3247
02:42:41,406 --> 02:42:44,168
I don't like the name, Liz.

3248
02:42:44,202 --> 02:42:45,548
- Sorry.

3249
02:42:45,583 --> 02:42:47,965
- And I don't do kitchens.

3250
02:42:49,173 --> 02:42:50,381
- Ma'am,

3251
02:42:50,415 --> 02:42:52,659
this is the Betty Ford Center.

3252
02:42:52,693 --> 02:42:54,868
We do whatever it takes.

3253
02:42:54,903 --> 02:42:58,320
And above all, we don't drink or use.

3254
02:42:58,354 --> 02:42:59,217
Even if--

3255
02:42:59,252 --> 02:43:02,945
- Even if our ass falls off, yes, I know.

3256
02:43:05,430 --> 02:43:08,813
[slow concerned music]

3257
02:43:15,302 --> 02:43:19,065
I'm Elizabeth Taylor and I'm an alcoholic.

3258
02:43:28,488 --> 02:43:31,836
- Thank you all for sharing
your experiences with us.

3259
02:43:31,871 --> 02:43:33,562
Um, Elizabeth.

3260
02:43:34,390 --> 02:43:36,461
Can you recall what event

3261
02:43:36,496 --> 02:43:39,740
or incident it was that caused you

3262
02:43:39,775 --> 02:43:41,501
to recognize the fact that

3263
02:43:41,535 --> 02:43:43,123
you had a problem?

3264
02:43:46,955 --> 02:43:48,542
- I still have a hard time believing

3265
02:43:48,577 --> 02:43:51,200
I'm actually here [laughs].

3266
02:43:51,235 --> 02:43:52,167
But yes ...

3267
02:43:53,720 --> 02:43:56,033
[sighs]

3268
02:43:56,067 --> 02:43:59,036
I remember waking up in hospital,

3269
02:44:00,037 --> 02:44:02,798
surrounded by friends and family,

3270
02:44:02,833 --> 02:44:05,939
and they said that I had a problem.

3271
02:44:07,561 --> 02:44:09,080
- We all have a problem,

3272
02:44:09,115 --> 02:44:11,117
that's why we're here.

3273
02:44:12,152 --> 02:44:13,602
- Well I guess I'd become an alcoholic,

3274
02:44:13,636 --> 02:44:17,399
and that combined with the
pain killers I was taking,

3275
02:44:17,433 --> 02:44:19,228
I couldn't handle it.

3276
02:44:21,230 --> 02:44:23,060
- At least you didn't try to hide it.

3277
02:44:23,094 --> 02:44:25,614
You had the courage to
come out in the open.

3278
02:44:25,648 --> 02:44:27,133
- Well ...

3279
02:44:27,167 --> 02:44:31,689
Yes, I just hope to God
that's all behind me now.

3280
02:44:31,723 --> 02:44:35,175
[slow optimistic music]

3281
02:44:37,522 --> 02:44:41,250
- That woman doesn't have one
single unexpressed thought

3282
02:44:41,285 --> 02:44:42,251
in her head.

3283
02:44:48,119 --> 02:44:50,190
[laughs]

3284
02:45:06,172 --> 02:45:09,485
No longer mourn for me when I am dead,

3285
02:45:10,555 --> 02:45:14,387
than you shall hear
the surly, sullen bell.

3286

Give warning to the world

3287
02:45:17,769 --> 02:45:20,945
that I am fled from this vile world,

3288
02:45:24,052 --> 02:45:27,227
with vilest worlds to dwell.

3289
02:45:27,262 --> 02:45:28,539
[men shout]

3290
02:45:28,573 --> 02:45:29,885
- Miss Taylor!

- Madam!

[cameras click]

3293
02:45:37,237 --> 02:45:40,240

[speaks in foreign language]

3295
02:45:44,003 --> 02:45:46,626
- I love you, Richard.

3296
02:45:46,660 --> 02:45:49,525
And I will never cease loving you.

3297
02:45:57,257 --> 02:45:58,120
Hey, Rock.

3298
02:45:58,879 --> 02:46:01,468
[laughs]

3299
02:46:01,503 --> 02:46:02,469
- Hi Bessy.

3300
02:46:02,504 --> 02:46:04,161
Careful who you kiss.

3301
02:46:04,195 --> 02:46:06,680
- I always kiss gorgeous men.

3302
02:46:06,715 --> 02:46:08,544
- Not so gorgeous.

3303
02:46:08,579 --> 02:46:09,545
Not no more.

3304
02:46:09,580 --> 02:46:10,857
- Oh baloney.

3305
02:46:10,891 --> 02:46:13,308
- Not like you, you piss me off.

3306
02:46:13,342 --> 02:46:15,586
You look as good as you
did when we made Giant.

3307
02:46:15,620 --> 02:46:17,829
- Oh, boy, are you some actor.

3308
02:46:17,864 --> 02:46:19,383
Who wrote your lines, hmm?

3309
02:46:19,417 --> 02:46:20,901
- Nah.

3310
02:46:20,936 --> 02:46:21,937
I'm serious.

3311
02:46:21,972 --> 02:46:23,594
You look great.

[coughs]

3313
02:46:25,458 --> 02:46:26,873
How's your life?

3314
02:46:26,907 --> 02:46:28,979
- Oh, you know me, kiddo.

3315
02:46:29,013 --> 02:46:31,084
I'm a survivor, it's in the genes.

3316
02:46:31,119 --> 02:46:33,362
- You always did look hot in your jeans.

3317
02:46:33,397 --> 02:46:35,468
[laughs]

3318
02:46:38,747 --> 02:46:40,507
- Hey partner.

3319
02:46:40,542 --> 02:46:44,097
What do you say we head
on back to Texas, hmm?

3320
02:46:44,132 --> 02:46:46,203
- I'd like to go back.

[slow concerned music]

3322
02:46:49,309 --> 02:46:50,172

3323
02:46:52,623 --> 02:46:53,486
- I know.

3324
02:47:00,148 --> 02:47:03,254
- You know what I miss about Texas?

3325
02:47:04,566 --> 02:47:06,223
Chocolate Martinis.

3327
02:47:09,709 --> 02:47:11,366
- Okay, then I'll give you one.

3328
02:47:11,400 --> 02:47:12,367
- Just one.

3329
02:47:12,401 --> 02:47:13,506
- A whole batch.

02:47:13,540 --> 02:47:16,129
[birds tweet]

3331
02:47:21,583 --> 02:47:23,378
- Chocolate Martinis.

3332
02:47:34,458 --> 02:47:37,185
- I am tired and I am grieving.

3333
02:47:38,427 --> 02:47:41,775
I am tired of us having to
convince the world out there

3334
02:47:41,810 --> 02:47:45,952
that AIDS is a universal
threat to all mankind.

3335

[crowd applaud]

02:47:49,162 --> 02:47:51,095
I have held a good friend in my arms

as his body began to fail,

3338
02:47:53,442 --> 02:47:56,445
and I am compelled by grief.

[cameras click]

3340
02:47:58,758 --> 02:48:01,209
The delays in confronting AIDS

3341
02:48:01,243 --> 02:48:03,970
tragically remind me of
the high price to be paid

3342
02:48:04,004 --> 02:48:06,179
when prejudice prevails.

3343
02:48:07,905 --> 02:48:12,289
AIDS has taught me how
fragile human existence is,

3344
02:48:12,323 --> 02:48:15,085
and that every life is to be cherished.

3345

02:48:17,328 --> 02:48:18,812
- Are you gonna act again, Miss Taylor,

3347
02:48:18,847 --> 02:48:20,814
or are you just gonna
pursue this AIDS work?

3348
02:48:20,849 --> 02:48:22,368
- I don't know if I pursue
it or it pursues me,

3349
02:48:22,402 --> 02:48:23,507
but--

3350
02:48:23,541 --> 02:48:24,680
- Miss Taylor?

3351
02:48:26,717 --> 02:48:27,821
- Since Rock Hudson's death,

3352
02:48:27,856 --> 02:48:29,892
I guess it's made the
work a little easier.

3353
02:48:29,927 --> 02:48:32,274
- Yes, but I'll tell you what amazes me.

3354
02:48:32,309 --> 02:48:33,758
It's truly amazing,

3355
02:48:33,793 --> 02:48:35,829
I call good friends of mine

3356
02:48:35,864 --> 02:48:37,555
to ask them to be a part of this,

3357
02:48:37,590 --> 02:48:38,832
lifelong friends,

3358
02:48:38,867 --> 02:48:41,973
and they duck out on me, they
just don't return my calls.

3359
02:48:42,008 --> 02:48:43,216
- Well, you know, it's AIDS.

3360
02:48:43,251 --> 02:48:44,700
People are embarrassed.

3361
02:48:44,735 --> 02:48:46,046
- Yes, but that's terrible,

3362
02:48:46,081 --> 02:48:47,462
I mean, it's like alcoholism,

3363
02:48:47,496 --> 02:48:50,982
it shouldn't be a disease
of shame, and it is.

3364
02:48:51,017 --> 02:48:51,983
- Well, what can you do?

3365
02:48:52,018 --> 02:48:54,365
- Well, we can all do something.

3366
02:48:54,400 --> 02:48:55,366
Try to make people aware,

3367
02:48:55,401 --> 02:48:56,367
I believe that's the first step,

3368
02:48:56,402 --> 02:48:57,989
that's what I'm trying to do.

3369
02:48:58,024 --> 02:48:58,956
Thank you.

3370
02:48:58,990 --> 02:48:59,819
- Over here, Miss Taylor, over here.

3371
02:48:59,853 --> 02:49:00,820
- Miss Taylor?

3372
02:49:00,854 --> 02:49:01,855
- One more question.

3373

[pours]

3374
02:49:03,823 --> 02:49:04,686
- Uhuh.

3375
02:49:05,652 --> 02:49:09,139
No, she's handling the press pretty well.

3376
02:49:09,173 --> 02:49:10,209
Right?

[plane takes off]

3378
02:49:12,245 --> 02:49:15,214
Well, we arrived at 2:30 LA time.

3379
02:49:17,285 --> 02:49:20,564
I'm afraid she's gonna have
to see a doctor though.

3380
02:49:20,598 --> 02:49:21,461
Yeah.

3381
02:49:24,119 --> 02:49:25,845
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

3382
02:49:28,572 --> 02:49:29,435
Mhmm.

3383
02:49:32,300 --> 02:49:34,129
- I don't know what
got me back here, I ...

3384
02:49:34,164 --> 02:49:37,615
I don't know, I'm trying to booze, food.

3385
02:49:41,343 --> 02:49:42,827
Pills, again.

3386
02:49:42,862 --> 02:49:43,897
- Yeah.

3387
02:49:43,932 --> 02:49:45,865
- It's always the pills for me too.

3388
02:49:45,899 --> 02:49:47,522
- Yes, but these were prescription.

3389
02:49:47,556 --> 02:49:48,419
- Yeah.

3390
02:49:48,454 --> 02:49:50,076
- They were prescribed to me for my back.

3391
02:49:50,110 --> 02:49:53,079
Damarall, percoden, valium.

3392
02:49:53,113 --> 02:49:54,598
- All in one day?

3393
02:49:55,392 --> 02:49:56,841
- Give me the name of that doctor.

3394
02:49:56,876 --> 02:49:59,016
[laughs]

3395
02:49:59,050 --> 02:50:01,639
- Oh honey, you're just like me.

3396
02:50:01,674 --> 02:50:03,123
- I beg your pardon?

3397
02:50:03,158 --> 02:50:06,196
- Give me pills, booze, food, men.

3398
02:50:07,852 --> 02:50:09,716
Nothing's ever enough.

3399
02:50:11,131 --> 02:50:12,443
- Yes, but you don't equate

3400
02:50:12,478 --> 02:50:14,859
alcohol and pills with men?

3401
02:50:16,136 --> 02:50:18,794
- Yes, it's a love addiction.

3402
02:50:18,829 --> 02:50:20,796
Look at me, I've been married four times,

3403
02:50:20,831 --> 02:50:23,523
and I never found anything,

3404
02:50:23,558 --> 02:50:25,042
not in this lifetime to fill up

3405
02:50:25,076 --> 02:50:27,803
that great big emptiness inside.

3406
02:50:29,322 --> 02:50:30,496
- Oh my God,

3407
02:50:30,530 --> 02:50:34,362
I've never thought of
love as an addiction.

3408
02:50:35,328 --> 02:50:37,572
So your name's Larry?

3409
02:50:37,606 --> 02:50:38,573
- Yeah.

02:50:38,607 --> 02:50:39,436
Larry Vercinski.

3411
02:50:39,470 --> 02:50:40,333
- Hmm.

3412
02:50:41,886 --> 02:50:43,612
And what do you, Larry?

3413
02:50:43,647 --> 02:50:44,717
[ducks quack]

3414
02:50:44,751 --> 02:50:46,097
- I move earth.

3415
02:50:46,132 --> 02:50:48,721
[laughs]

3416
02:50:48,755 --> 02:50:49,756
- I'll bet.

3417
02:50:49,791 --> 02:50:51,310
[laughs]

3418
02:50:51,344 --> 02:50:53,243
- Operator, moving equipment.

3419
02:50:53,277 --> 02:50:55,003
- Ah, I'm impressed.

3420
02:50:58,524 --> 02:51:00,422
- Do you wanna walk?

3421
02:51:01,734 --> 02:51:02,597
- Okay.

3422
02:51:04,392 --> 02:51:06,428
I'm a bit slow at the start.

3423
02:51:06,463 --> 02:51:08,741
[clears throat]

3424
02:51:08,775 --> 02:51:12,331
Maybe I should get a job
moving earth [laughs].

3425
02:51:12,365 --> 02:51:14,988
God knows I need something.

3426
02:51:15,023 --> 02:51:17,474
My career, ugh, almost dead.

3427
02:51:19,165 --> 02:51:21,719
- But you're Elizabeth Taylor.

3428
02:51:21,754 --> 02:51:23,100
- Being Elizabeth Taylor used to be

3429
02:51:23,134 --> 02:51:25,516
good and sufficient reason
for waking up every morning.

3430
02:51:25,551 --> 02:51:28,070
Now it just seems so nothing.

3431
02:51:29,279 --> 02:51:31,867
- Oh come on, don't talk like that.

3432
02:51:31,902 --> 02:51:33,075
You're still full of fire,

3433
02:51:33,110 --> 02:51:35,940
you have your AIDS charity.

3434
02:51:35,975 --> 02:51:36,941
How many people that matter

3435
02:51:36,976 --> 02:51:39,634
care about people like you do?

3436
02:51:39,668 --> 02:51:42,982
Even that's bigger than
being Elizabeth Taylor, huh?

3437
02:51:43,016 --> 02:51:44,121
No offense.

3438
02:51:44,155 --> 02:51:45,225
[laughs]

3439
02:51:45,260 --> 02:51:47,952
- It's okay, kid, I can take it.

3440
02:51:49,644 --> 02:51:52,888
Someone suggested I start a new career.

3441
02:51:52,923 --> 02:51:53,889
In perfume.

3442
02:51:53,924 --> 02:51:55,166
- There you go.

3443
02:51:55,201 --> 02:51:56,961
What would you call it?

3444
02:51:56,996 --> 02:51:58,515
- Hmm.

3445
02:51:58,549 --> 02:52:00,448
What do I know best?

3446
02:52:01,276 --> 02:52:02,691
- What?

3447
02:52:02,726 --> 02:52:03,727
- Passion.

3448
02:52:03,761 --> 02:52:04,900

3450
02:52:23,988 --> 02:52:24,955
- John.

3451
02:52:24,989 --> 02:52:25,956
Just walk in.

3452
02:52:25,990 --> 02:52:27,095
- This is it.

3453
02:52:27,129 --> 02:52:27,958
- Wow.

3454
02:52:27,992 --> 02:52:28,821
[laughs]

[sexy country music]

3458
02:52:36,484 --> 02:52:38,313
- That is a double-decker.

3459
02:52:38,348 --> 02:52:40,453
Pickles, onions, relish, mustard

3460
02:52:40,488 --> 02:52:42,282
and mayonnaise with fries.

3461
02:52:42,317 --> 02:52:43,283
You got enough fries?

3462
02:52:43,318 --> 02:52:44,354
- Oh yes.

3463
02:52:45,803 --> 02:52:49,013
Of course I haven't been to
a place like this in years.

3464
02:52:49,048 --> 02:52:50,394
- Right well,

3465
02:52:50,429 --> 02:52:54,225
it's not exactly the typical
beller palace, but ...

3466
02:52:54,260 --> 02:52:55,572
Ready to leap?

3467
02:52:56,849 --> 02:52:57,815
- Mmm.

3468
02:52:57,850 --> 02:52:59,127
Yes, let's leap.

3469
02:53:09,171 --> 02:53:10,932
[laugh]

3470
02:53:10,966 --> 02:53:12,416
What?

3471
02:53:12,451 --> 02:53:15,937
- I've never met anyone like you before.

3472
02:53:15,971 --> 02:53:17,352
It's scary.

3473
02:53:17,387 --> 02:53:18,698
It's wonderful.

3474
02:53:19,458 --> 02:53:22,322
- Well, it could be dangerous.

3475
02:53:22,357 --> 02:53:24,532
What if we fall in love?

3476
02:53:28,156 --> 02:53:30,400
- I think I already have.

3477
02:53:35,335 --> 02:53:38,511

- How's my little girl?

3484
02:54:10,474 --> 02:54:12,165
- Happy.

3485
02:54:12,200 --> 02:54:14,167
And about to be 60.

3486
02:54:14,202 --> 02:54:16,791
- Well, that's not so bad.

3487
02:54:16,825 --> 02:54:20,795
What's important is that those
60 years have been good ones.

3488
02:54:20,829 --> 02:54:23,453
You've had a wonderful life.

3489

get it all together here.

Good.

Can you, will you take this please?

02:54:55,795 --> 02:54:58,315
you'll be coming here.
