and fasten your seat belt.

181
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:25,432
Can I have your
attention, folks,

182
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:27,035
for a brief safety
demonstration.

183
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,236
So if you look at this in
the seatback in front of you,

184
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:30,904
this'll have all the information
you'll need.

185
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:33,707
There are two exits on this side
of the aircraft...

186
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:39,413
By the way, thank you
for giving up

187
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:40,914
your first-class seat
for that passenger.

188
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:42,382
You did him and I a big favor,

189
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:44,151
so thank you,
that's very kind of you.

190
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:45,652
Don't mention it.

191
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:47,354
When you've flown five hours
in cattle class

192
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:49,489
on a C-130 bound for Kabul,

193
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:51,959
nine hours in coach
is a welcome luxury.

194
00:09:52,026 --> 00:09:54,394
-You're military?
-Army. EOD.

195
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:57,130
Well, retired.
Flying down to Santo Domingo

196
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:58,732
to walk my daughter
down the aisle.

197
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,101
Yeah, she always wanted
to get married on the beach,

198
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:02,669
so I'm not going
to disappoint her.

199
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:03,570
That's wonderful.

200
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:05,039
Congratulations, Mr. Garrett.

201
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,473
Thanks.

202
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:10,611
I'll be glad when we finally
land in Santo Domingo.

203
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:12,379
I just need a few drinks
on the beach,

204
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,514
then we can turn around
and head back to NYC.

205
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:17,484
-It's been a tough week.
-Sounds like a plan to me.

206
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:23,290
You set the device
with one of these.

207
00:10:23,357 --> 00:10:25,792
Why would you have
these otherwise?

208
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:30,697
I've been thinking about it.

209
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:31,965
The numbers 3, 9, and 10

210
00:10:32,033 --> 00:10:34,835
are the most prevalent
throughout <i>Inferno.</i>

211
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:36,803
The poem is in three parts.

212
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,405
There are nine circles of Hell.

213
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:41,308
The poem is 145 components.

214
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,543
Add those up, you get 10.

215
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,446
All right, so what did you
come up with?

216
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:47,948
Nothing.

217
00:10:48,016 --> 00:10:50,118
None of the math adds up.

218
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:51,918
No matter how
I think it over.

219
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:57,190
But what if I'm overthinking it?

220
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:58,859
[snaps fingers]
Then it hit me.

221
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:02,462
Canto I, <i>The Divine Comedy.</i>

222
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:04,665
The poem begins
on March 24.

223
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,967
Are you kidding?
Today's date?

224
00:11:07,035 --> 00:11:11,039
March 24, the year 1300.

225
00:11:11,105 --> 00:11:14,441
All right, contact TSA JFK.

226
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:16,343
Have them run all
the fake IDs we found

227
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,278
through their facial
recognition.

228
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,547
I want to find out if our perps
were there today.

229
00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:21,948
Copy that.

230
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:34,327
Flight attendants,
arm doors, cross check.

231
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:42,235
Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf
of Captain Wayne Curtis

232
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:43,737
and the entire crew,
welcome aboard

233
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:46,606
Coastal Air Flight 2191
with nonstop service

234
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:48,642
from New York
to Santo Domingo.

235
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:21,908
This is Special Agent Rico Dietz

236
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:23,710
with the FBI New York City
field office.

237
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:25,445
Put me through to Frank Wolfe.

238
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:27,514
This is an emergency.

239
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:29,916
FRANK WOLFE: Yeah, mm-hmm.

240
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:33,620
So have them write
the report again.

241
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,825
Let me get back to you.

242
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,231
This is Frank Wolfe.

243
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:45,398
Mr. Wolfe, this is
Special Agent Rico Dietz

244
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,467
at the JTTF New York office.

245
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:49,736
We have credible evidence
that there's an airliner

246
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:52,206
with an IED outbound
of New York today.

247
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,008
What are you talking about?

248
00:12:54,075 --> 00:12:56,309
This morning, my team
conducted a raid on

249
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:58,179
a suspected terror cell
out of Queens.

250
00:12:58,246 --> 00:13:00,914
What we found were bomb-making
materials and equipment.

251
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:05,552
FBI intel branch intercepted
multiple communications

252
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:08,288
with the numbers 2191.

253
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:10,423
At first, we thought
it was an address.

254
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,993
But now we believe
it's a flight number.

255
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,196
It's a Coastal Air flight
outbound JFK,

256
00:13:15,263 --> 00:13:17,497
Flight 2191 to Santo Domingo.

257
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:20,700
Departure time 8:05 a.m.

258
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,036
8:05.

259
00:13:22,103 --> 00:13:24,371
That flight takes off
from JFK in three minutes.

260
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:26,274
Contact JFK Tower.

261
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:29,342
They must ground
that flight immediately.

262
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:34,314
Tower, this is
Coastal 2-1-Niner-1.

263
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:36,083
Request taxi.

264
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,924
Coastal 2-1-Niner-1,
runway 3-1-left,

265
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,992
taxi left, Bravo Juliet.

266
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,295
Copy, Tower.

267
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,197
3-1-left.

268
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:51,299
Bravo and Juliet.

269
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:53,100
Coastal 2-1-Niner-1,

270
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:54,334
you're cleared
for takeoff.

271
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:55,735
Better get outta here.

272
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:57,238
Probably be the last plane
to make it up

273
00:13:57,305 --> 00:13:59,506
before the storm
shuts down the Tri-State.

274
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:02,876
Music to my ears, Tower.

275
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:06,713
Flight attendants,
prepare for takeoff.

276
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:11,052
[phone rings]

277
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:16,623
[ring]

278
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,792
JFK Tower, go ahead.

279
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:20,560
It's Frank Wolfe
at Eastern Regional,

280
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:22,662
with me on the line is
Special Agent Rico Dietz

281
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:25,132
of the FBI,
listen very carefully:

282
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,601
I need you to execute
an immediate takeoff abort

283
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:29,636
to Coastal Air Flight 2191.

284
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,805
That's 2-1-Niner-1.

285
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,673
There's an explosive device
onboard the plane.

286
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,343
We're heading to JFK now.

287
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:36,810
This is Dietz,
be advised

288
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:38,678
the device on that plane
is not yet armed.

289
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:40,281
But once it reaches 1,300 feet,

290
00:14:40,348 --> 00:14:42,949
-we're gonna miss the abort.
-How do you know that?

291
00:14:43,017 --> 00:14:45,019
This group has a thing
for numerology,

292
00:14:45,086 --> 00:14:47,454
the 1,300 holds
significance for them.

293
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:51,958
Plus it fits the pattern
for this kind of attack.

294
00:14:52,026 --> 00:14:55,363
But once it passes 1,300 feet,
we will miss the abort.

295
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:57,064
Now hurry.

296
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:01,168
Who has eyes on
Coastal 2191?

297
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:03,037
I do.

298
00:15:03,104 --> 00:15:04,938
[phone clatters]

299
00:15:07,308 --> 00:15:11,511
I just gave 2191 the all-clear
on runway 3-1-left.

300
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:21,188
-Coastal approach V1.
-2191 has reached

301
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:23,590
decision speed,
it's too late to abort.

302
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:27,094
That is 137 tons of aircraft
moving at V1 speed.

303
00:15:27,161 --> 00:15:29,096
You can't just
hit the brakes on that.

304
00:15:29,163 --> 00:15:31,132
No, the pilots have to continue
takeoff at this point.

305
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:33,067
If they don't, they're going
to overshoot the runway,

306
00:15:33,134 --> 00:15:35,869
jeopardize the airplane
and the passengers.

307
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:39,106
WOLFE: <i>Alert 2191,</i>
<i>tell them what's happening.</i>

308
00:15:39,173 --> 00:15:40,740
<i>They can turn around</i>
<i>and circle the airport</i>

309
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:42,776
<i>until they maintain</i>
<i>landing speed.</i>

310
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,614
What's going on?

311
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:50,151
Coastal 2191,
this is JFK Tower.

312
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:51,851
A little bit of a situation.

313
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:55,189
FBI has alerted us that there
may be an explosive device

314
00:15:55,256 --> 00:15:56,523
on your aircraft.

315
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:59,193
Now just remain
at a safety altitude

316
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,129
of under 1,300 feet.

317
00:16:02,196 --> 00:16:04,365
Tower, do you have
a location on the device?

318
00:16:04,432 --> 00:16:06,133
<i>Coastal 2191, negative.</i>

319
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,137
You are to maintain
altitude below 1,300 feet.

320
00:16:10,204 --> 00:16:13,540
Did she just say 1,300?

321
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:15,842
Tower, please repeat altitude.

322
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:20,114
Coastal 2191, I repeat,
maintain below 1,300.

323
00:16:20,181 --> 00:16:22,649
The device isn't active
until it reaches 1,300,

324
00:16:22,716 --> 00:16:24,851
at which point,
it will be armed.

325
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:26,420
Our current speed is 230 knots.

326
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:29,056
We'll reach 1,300
in 20 seconds.

327
00:16:29,123 --> 00:16:31,058
Level off climb angle.

328
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:34,261
Copy that, Tower. 2-5-0.

329
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:36,397
2-5-0?
What've they got,

330
00:16:36,464 --> 00:16:39,133
shorter buildings
in Long Island?

331
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,202
Tower, reducing thrust
for heading.

332
00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:45,206
Already at 800 feet.

333
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:06,726
Coastal exiting traffic pattern.

334
00:17:09,497 --> 00:17:11,931
900.

335
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:15,169
1,000 feet, reduce thrust.

336
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:19,507
Tower, request immediate
alternate vector

337
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:21,841
for return to JFK.

338
00:17:24,045 --> 00:17:27,048
We've reached 1,200,
reduce thrust.

339
00:17:27,114 --> 00:17:29,350
We're moving
as fast as possible.

340
00:17:29,417 --> 00:17:32,053
Leveling to maintain below 13.

341
00:17:34,522 --> 00:17:36,223
Maintaining 13.

342
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,261
Obstacle.

343
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:44,265
Obstacle approaching.

344
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:46,033
Radio broadcast tower!

345
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:50,504
Tower, Coastal increasing lift
along 250.

346
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,239
We have no choice or we crash.

347
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:05,186
[heavy breathing]

348
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:06,454
Oh, we're not gonna die!

349
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,155
We are not gonna die!

350
00:18:17,498 --> 00:18:18,731
[both panting]

351
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:24,338
2191 surpassed 1,300.

352
00:18:24,405 --> 00:18:25,839
Coastal 2191,

353
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:28,175
maintain until
further instructions.

354
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:31,345
Get Coastal
some new heading,

355
00:18:31,412 --> 00:18:33,880
turn them around and bring them
back over that storm system

356
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,648
as best as you can.

357
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:36,983
Get Air Traffic on the line,

358
00:18:37,051 --> 00:18:39,120
they need to know
what's going on.

359
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:41,489
<i>Sir, they've reached 1,300.</i>

360
00:18:41,555 --> 00:18:42,822
Damn it!

361
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:45,725
This plan was set in
motion long ago.

362
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:48,295
You cannot stop us.

363
00:18:48,362 --> 00:18:50,663
Why not?

364
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,665
What is it you want
with this plane?

365
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:55,735
To simply destroy evil.

366
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,871
Look to scripture.

367
00:18:57,937 --> 00:19:00,640
It's all there if you
read the passages.

368
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:04,178
21, the number of sin.

369
00:19:04,245 --> 00:19:06,679
Rebellion.

370
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:09,316
The disobedience of God.

371
00:19:09,383 --> 00:19:11,619
91.

372
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:13,853
From Psalms 91.

373
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,190
Protection of prayer.

374
00:19:17,358 --> 00:19:18,992
Don't be fooled.

375
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:21,028
For the Devil quotes
from Psalm 91

376
00:19:21,095 --> 00:19:23,564
in the Book of Matthew.

377
00:19:23,631 --> 00:19:28,935
2, 1, 9, 1.

378
00:19:29,003 --> 00:19:31,671
The wicked must be punished.

379
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,345
Don't get in our way.

380
00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:40,114
Dietz, I'm on with TSA.

381
00:19:40,181 --> 00:19:42,016
Coastal runs out of
Terminal Four.

382
00:19:42,082 --> 00:19:44,817
They just put in brand-new
credential authorization units.

383
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:46,753
The system verifies
every passenger.

384
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:49,223
It'll spot a fake on content.

385
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:52,426
But so far, every passenger
is verified.

386
00:19:52,493 --> 00:19:54,928
They're still working
on the facial rec.

387
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:58,566
All right, tell them
to forward it to me here.

388
00:19:58,632 --> 00:19:59,999
This will happen.

389
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:03,836
You will see.

390
00:20:11,011 --> 00:20:13,013
We've armed the damn thing.

391
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:18,851
So...

392
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:20,853
we all right?

393
00:20:25,626 --> 00:20:28,462
Flight crew, 7-700.

394
00:20:41,675 --> 00:20:44,278
[heavy breathing]

395
00:20:44,345 --> 00:20:46,879
[gasps] Hey, is something
wrong with the plane?

396
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:48,449
Everything's okay
with the plane.

397
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:50,084
It was just an air pocket.

398
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,751
What's an air pocket?

399
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:53,187
D-Do the pilots
know what that is?

400
00:20:53,254 --> 00:20:54,787
Have they flown
through one before?

401
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:56,223
-Do they know what that is?
-Of course.

402
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:57,957
Captain Curtis has
over 7,000 logged hours

403
00:20:58,025 --> 00:20:59,393
and First Officer Misch
was a lieutenant

404
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,828
in the Air Force
and is now a training pilot.

405
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:04,231
We're in good hands.

406
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:07,368
Oh, it's bad.

407
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:08,535
I know it is.

408
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:10,404
I know it is.
[deep breathing]

409
00:21:24,652 --> 00:21:27,688
I'm here.
Why are we code 7-700?

410
00:21:27,755 --> 00:21:30,391
What happened on the takeoff?

411
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:31,759
Military has informed us

412
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:35,396
that we do have
an active bomb on board.

413
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:37,598
We don't know who has it,

414
00:21:37,665 --> 00:21:39,932
we don't know if it's
on one of the passengers,

415
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:41,435
on their person.

416
00:21:41,502 --> 00:21:43,137
There's only a little bit
of information

417
00:21:43,203 --> 00:21:45,105
available at this time.

418
00:21:45,172 --> 00:21:46,906
Why aren't we landing?

419
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:48,575
We're not sure how
the bomb operates,

420
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:50,477
and we think it would be
a bigger danger if we landed

421
00:21:50,544 --> 00:21:55,848
at this time, so we're not gonna
be informing the passengers.

422
00:21:55,915 --> 00:21:57,217
Understood.

423
00:21:57,284 --> 00:21:58,818
Thank you.

424
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:17,404
Marshal...

425
00:22:17,471 --> 00:22:19,206
What's up with the 7-700?

426
00:22:19,273 --> 00:22:22,242
Um, we have a situation where

427
00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:25,245
ground control believes that
there is an explosive device

428
00:22:25,312 --> 00:22:27,414
on the plane,
and we can't land

429
00:22:27,481 --> 00:22:29,750
or we risk putting
a lot more lives in danger

430
00:22:29,817 --> 00:22:31,085
than just our own,
and it's--

431
00:22:31,151 --> 00:22:33,420
-Where is it?
-No idea.

432
00:22:33,487 --> 00:22:35,489
They don't know where it is
or what it looks like.

433
00:22:35,556 --> 00:22:37,890
-Any suspects?
-No, all they know

434
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:39,760
is that it's armed.

435
00:22:39,827 --> 00:22:41,261
Okay, all right,
so we're--

436
00:22:41,328 --> 00:22:44,665
we're looking for
a suspicious item

437
00:22:44,732 --> 00:22:46,633
that could be...

438
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,137
that could be a detonator,
there's 285 people on board.

439
00:22:50,204 --> 00:22:52,206
They all have carry-on,
personal items,

440
00:22:52,272 --> 00:22:54,775
so just--let's just...

441
00:22:54,842 --> 00:22:58,245
They might've used plastic
explosives to get it past TSA.

442
00:22:58,312 --> 00:23:00,047
Um, I'll call the airline
and get a bagg--

443
00:23:00,114 --> 00:23:01,782
baggage reconciliation report.

444
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:05,352
Maybe if we can connect
the bag that the bomb is in

445
00:23:05,419 --> 00:23:06,986
to the passenger
that checked it...

446
00:23:07,054 --> 00:23:10,190
Okay, okay, honey,
calm down, all right?

447
00:23:10,257 --> 00:23:12,892
Now before you come
back out there,

448
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:14,228
take a look around
and see if there's

449
00:23:14,294 --> 00:23:16,663
anything suspicious
in here, okay?

450
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,866
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right.

451
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:20,467
Take it easy.

452
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,481
Nothing.

453
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,785
That storm is getting stronger.

454
00:24:11,852 --> 00:24:15,389
We need to adjust course
heading to avoid the system.

455
00:24:15,456 --> 00:24:17,925
It's gonna be shaky either way.

456
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,594
That storm is messing up
everything.

457
00:24:20,661 --> 00:24:22,563
Everything.

458
00:24:23,697 --> 00:24:26,133
Rico, we got that footage
you requested.

459
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:33,474
Wait, play that back.

460
00:24:45,686 --> 00:24:48,121
This is Dietz.

461
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,124
We have a code yellow.

462
00:24:51,191 --> 00:24:53,894
And how do we know this
bomb threat isn't a hoax?

463
00:24:53,961 --> 00:24:55,662
Have they made their demands?

464
00:24:55,729 --> 00:24:57,598
Did the group declare
their reasons

465
00:24:57,664 --> 00:24:59,967
or intentions
behind the threat?

466
00:25:00,033 --> 00:25:03,337
Bomb threats and bomb scares
are two very different things.

467
00:25:03,403 --> 00:25:04,671
Most threats are fake,

468
00:25:04,738 --> 00:25:06,807
made to instill fear,
intimidate.

469
00:25:06,874 --> 00:25:08,475
Fewer than 7% of threats

470
00:25:08,542 --> 00:25:10,711
turn up actual live
explosive material.

471
00:25:10,777 --> 00:25:14,047
100% of scares involve
imminent risk from

472
00:25:14,114 --> 00:25:16,550
an actual live
explosive device.

473
00:25:16,617 --> 00:25:19,286
And bomb scares come with
little to no warning.

474
00:25:19,353 --> 00:25:23,690
So, has the bomb scare been
reported to the DEN/ATSC?

475
00:25:23,757 --> 00:25:25,959
I want all channels open
on the Domestic Events Network.

476
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:27,661
ATSC has been notified.

477
00:25:27,728 --> 00:25:31,164
Put airport security and
emergency crews on standby.

478
00:25:31,231 --> 00:25:33,066
And let JFK management
know we're bringing

479
00:25:33,133 --> 00:25:34,868
this bird back down.

480
00:25:34,935 --> 00:25:36,670
Alert TSA explosives teams

481
00:25:36,737 --> 00:25:39,406
to the situation
and have them ready.

482
00:25:39,473 --> 00:25:42,142
I want that plane on
the ground ASAP

483
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:44,478
with a military escort
to bring them home.

484
00:25:44,545 --> 00:25:46,647
[phone rings]

485
00:25:47,848 --> 00:25:50,083
We've got a problem.
One of our perps was

486
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:52,753
at JFK this morning.
Looks like he hacked

487
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:55,489
into the TSA's credential
authentication system

488
00:25:55,556 --> 00:25:58,825
using one of those fake IDs
at Terminal Four.

489
00:25:58,892 --> 00:26:01,895
TSA thinks it might've been
some kind of AI attack.

490
00:26:01,962 --> 00:26:04,765
They've been blind all morning
and didn't even realize--

491
00:26:04,831 --> 00:26:06,433
Wait, I don't understand, blind?

492
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,936
-Blind how?
-TSA's still trying

493
00:26:09,003 --> 00:26:10,671
to figure that out.

494
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:13,774
They're afraid that the hack
reprogrammed their system

495
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,643
in order to let only specific
items go through.

496
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:19,947
And that's how they
got the device past the TSA.

497
00:26:20,014 --> 00:26:21,848
That's the theory
at the moment.

498
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:23,784
Our suspect initiated tech,

499
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:26,253
made for sure the plane
took off, and then he left.

500
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,155
Their techs think it
might've been some kind of

501
00:26:28,221 --> 00:26:31,258
military grade AI in order
to commandeer such an advanced

502
00:26:31,325 --> 00:26:35,095
security system so quickly
and accurately.

503
00:26:35,162 --> 00:26:38,265
Unfortunately, our tech
who initiated everything

504
00:26:38,332 --> 00:26:41,001
died of a gunshot wound
less than an hour ago.

505
00:26:41,069 --> 00:26:43,570
Another scan of the place where
we found him turned up nothing,

506
00:26:43,637 --> 00:26:45,973
and the field office is
scouring for leads

507
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,741
and hellbent on red tape.

508
00:27:25,946 --> 00:27:28,082
Hey, can I talk to you, please?

509
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:31,151
Someplace private, quiet?

510
00:27:32,386 --> 00:27:34,287
In the galley?

511
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,298
Is there an Air Marshal
on board?

512
00:27:45,365 --> 00:27:47,501
I can't disclose
that information.

513
00:27:47,567 --> 00:27:49,169
Okay, then who's the guy
out there doing

514
00:27:49,236 --> 00:27:50,871
random sweeps of
the overhead bins?

515
00:27:50,937 --> 00:27:53,740
-What's he looking for?
-Sir, I-I appreciate your help

516
00:27:53,807 --> 00:27:55,776
with the seat change earlier,
but I'm gonna have

517
00:27:55,842 --> 00:27:58,412
-to ask you to take your seat.
-Is there a specific threat

518
00:27:58,478 --> 00:28:00,180
against this aircraft?

519
00:28:00,247 --> 00:28:01,615
Are we carrying something
onboard?

520
00:28:01,682 --> 00:28:04,317
Sir, please take your seat.

521
00:28:04,384 --> 00:28:06,186
You don't know where it is.

522
00:28:06,253 --> 00:28:07,554
That's why he's sweeping
the bins

523
00:28:07,621 --> 00:28:09,656
and I assume you
cleared the galley here.

524
00:28:09,723 --> 00:28:11,458
Is everything all right
back here?

525
00:28:11,525 --> 00:28:13,460
Yes, we're fine.
This passenger just

526
00:28:13,527 --> 00:28:14,928
had some questions.

527
00:28:14,995 --> 00:28:16,663
You can escort him back
to his seat for me?

528
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:19,167
-Gladly, let's go.
-You must be the Air Marshal.

529
00:28:19,232 --> 00:28:21,401
Sir, please exit the galley.

530
00:28:21,468 --> 00:28:24,038
Look, I can assist with
in-flight threat SOP

531
00:28:24,105 --> 00:28:25,605
for a Code Bravo.

532
00:28:25,672 --> 00:28:27,374
Sweep all the areas
that are normally missed

533
00:28:27,441 --> 00:28:31,211
-by ground security checks--
-Who is this guy?

534
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:33,647
Army, 71st Ordnance Group.

535
00:28:33,714 --> 00:28:35,916
I have EOD experience,
man, I can help.

536
00:28:35,982 --> 00:28:37,350
Is that so?

537
00:28:37,417 --> 00:28:39,187
I'll show you my VA card
if you want.

538
00:28:39,252 --> 00:28:40,420
That won't be necessary.

539
00:28:40,487 --> 00:28:42,123
I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

540
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,890
Please leave the galley, sir.

541
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:47,694
[scoffs]

542
00:28:56,403 --> 00:28:58,472
Where's he seated, Vanessa?

543
00:28:58,538 --> 00:29:01,209
He was ticketed for first class,
but he switched seats

544
00:29:01,274 --> 00:29:02,743
with another passenger
while boarding.

545
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:04,878
He had a first-class ticket
and he switched with

546
00:29:04,945 --> 00:29:07,581
another passenger to
come back here in coach?

547
00:29:11,284 --> 00:29:13,720
I'm gonna run a check
on both of them.

548
00:29:13,787 --> 00:29:16,323
See if either raise
a red flag.

549
00:29:42,883 --> 00:29:46,353
Ground,
this is Coastal 2-1-Niner-1.

550
00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:48,955
35 miles out over
the Atlantic,

551
00:29:49,023 --> 00:29:51,391
initiating emergency
fuel release

552
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:54,661
per earlier ATC request.

553
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,370
Can you go back
to your seat, sir?

554
00:30:03,436 --> 00:30:05,039
The fasten seat belt sign is on.

555
00:30:05,106 --> 00:30:06,706
Yeah, no problem.

556
00:30:06,773 --> 00:30:08,308
Thank you.

557
00:30:18,952 --> 00:30:20,954
This is Wolfe.

558
00:30:21,022 --> 00:30:23,291
When was this?

559
00:30:23,356 --> 00:30:24,791
Send it to me right now,

560
00:30:24,858 --> 00:30:26,060
I wanna see
what they're seeing.

561
00:30:26,127 --> 00:30:27,527
Thanks.

562
00:30:29,263 --> 00:30:32,099
Dietz, it's Frank Wolfe.

563
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:38,005
TSA just got a passenger
background request on 2191.

564
00:30:38,072 --> 00:30:40,507
Air Marshal up there
called it in.

565
00:30:40,574 --> 00:30:42,109
FBI cross-checked notice,

566
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,877
they're gonna send me over
what they've got.

567
00:30:43,944 --> 00:30:45,979
-They're CC'ing me on it.
-Did they say if there

568
00:30:46,047 --> 00:30:48,015
was a specific disturbance
of any kind?

569
00:30:48,082 --> 00:30:50,817
No, not yet.
Maybe the Air Marshal's

570
00:30:50,884 --> 00:30:54,487
got a couple of people
that are-- Hang on.

571
00:30:57,357 --> 00:31:00,161
"Taylor Garrett.

572
00:31:00,228 --> 00:31:04,798
Chief Master Sergeant,
Army, 71st Ordnance Group."

573
00:31:04,865 --> 00:31:06,933
Military.

574
00:31:08,435 --> 00:31:11,305
"Larry Durante,
Scranton, Pennsylvania."

575
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:12,472
No, he's not military.

576
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:14,141
<i>Okay, send me those, will ya?</i>

577
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:16,077
No problem.
Where are you?

578
00:31:16,143 --> 00:31:18,678
FBI cast a wide net.

579
00:31:18,745 --> 00:31:21,015
Agents deployed for interviews
with military personnel,

580
00:31:21,082 --> 00:31:25,585
contractors, subcontractors
active duty, retired, enlisted,

581
00:31:25,652 --> 00:31:28,055
and officers all around
the country.

582
00:31:28,122 --> 00:31:31,458
One of our agents got a POI over
at the Air National Guard Base

583
00:31:31,524 --> 00:31:33,094
in West Hampton, New York.

584
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,729
We think he might
be part of this corrupt AI.

585
00:31:35,795 --> 00:31:38,865
Figured I'd do a face to face.

586
00:31:44,372 --> 00:31:47,108
Nothing came back on those
two guys, Garrett and Durante.

587
00:31:47,174 --> 00:31:50,777
The one was with the 71st,
or he used to be.

588
00:31:50,844 --> 00:31:53,580
Used to be.
What's that mean?

589
00:31:53,647 --> 00:31:55,715
He's retired, but according
to his record,

590
00:31:55,782 --> 00:31:57,951
he had a long and distinguished
military career.

591
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:00,754
So he's actually
able to help.

592
00:32:02,023 --> 00:32:03,690
Yeah.

593
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:06,826
BANSHEE: Oh, look,
I made it to round two.

594
00:32:06,893 --> 00:32:09,629
You're not the same two feds
I spoke to earlier?

595
00:32:09,696 --> 00:32:12,066
I'm Special Agent Rico Dietz,
this is--

596
00:32:12,133 --> 00:32:13,267
Special?

597
00:32:13,334 --> 00:32:15,001
What makes you so special?

598
00:32:15,069 --> 00:32:17,271
You know, those two guys
I talked to earlier?

599
00:32:17,338 --> 00:32:18,571
They were special.

600
00:32:18,638 --> 00:32:21,208
Bet your partner here
is special.

601
00:32:21,275 --> 00:32:22,709
Tell you something, Rico.

602
00:32:22,776 --> 00:32:26,013
If everybody's special,
then nobody is.

603
00:32:27,514 --> 00:32:29,783
Little early
for a drink, no?

604
00:32:29,849 --> 00:32:31,218
So you know why we're here?

605
00:32:31,285 --> 00:32:32,686
Well, the guys earlier
wanted to talk to me

606
00:32:32,752 --> 00:32:34,621
about a classified project.

607
00:32:34,688 --> 00:32:36,357
What can you tell us
about your work

608
00:32:36,424 --> 00:32:37,757
with artificial intelligence?

609
00:32:37,824 --> 00:32:40,694
That it's classified.

610
00:32:43,663 --> 00:32:45,565
"Project Hat Trick.

611
00:32:45,632 --> 00:32:47,368
"Declassified,

612
00:32:47,435 --> 00:32:49,869
"October 31, 2021.

613
00:32:51,671 --> 00:32:55,242
Military Artificial
Intelligence Program."

614
00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:57,577
Hat Trick.

615
00:32:57,644 --> 00:32:59,113
Are you a hockey fan?

616
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,547
I don't name the projects.

617
00:33:00,613 --> 00:33:02,183
And I prefer football.

618
00:33:02,249 --> 00:33:03,384
Go Steelers.

619
00:33:03,451 --> 00:33:05,652
Hey, I'm from Pittsburgh.

620
00:33:05,719 --> 00:33:07,388
Is that where you're from?

621
00:33:07,455 --> 00:33:11,092
Good for you.

622
00:33:11,158 --> 00:33:13,227
All right, so why did they
name it Hat Trick?

623
00:33:13,294 --> 00:33:15,762
I haven't worked on
this project in 10 months.

624
00:33:15,829 --> 00:33:18,631
I am not the person
you're looking for.

625
00:33:20,034 --> 00:33:24,305
Look, I know,
and you know,

626
00:33:24,372 --> 00:33:27,008
you're probably not our guy.

627
00:33:27,074 --> 00:33:29,043
But we came all the way
out here.

628
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:31,845
Gotta make it worth
the taxpayers' money.

629
00:33:31,911 --> 00:33:35,648
Just answer three questions
and we'll be on our way.

630
00:33:35,715 --> 00:33:38,419
Okay, you wanna know why
it's called Hat Trick?

631
00:33:38,486 --> 00:33:41,188
The three most difficult points
of functionality in AI:

632
00:33:41,255 --> 00:33:44,358
computing power, trust deficit,
and human level performance.

633
00:33:44,425 --> 00:33:47,094
The primary program objective
was to optimize

634
00:33:47,161 --> 00:33:49,130
those three points
for air combat,

635
00:33:49,196 --> 00:33:51,631
build a faster,
smarter-thinking aircraft

636
00:33:51,698 --> 00:33:54,168
while still remaining
subservient to the pilot.

637
00:33:54,235 --> 00:33:56,003
So how did it go?

638
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:58,372
[scoffs]

639
00:33:58,439 --> 00:34:01,708
How did it go?

640
00:34:01,775 --> 00:34:04,844
Goddamn Volos shot down
a great pilot

641
00:34:04,911 --> 00:34:06,846
and a very good friend of mine.

642
00:34:12,685 --> 00:34:14,721
Have you ever called
a friend's mother,

643
00:34:14,788 --> 00:34:17,757
gave her the single most
horrific piece of news

644
00:34:17,824 --> 00:34:20,127
that she will ever hear?

645
00:34:21,694 --> 00:34:24,864
Volos? You mean
the Volodrezjkans?

646
00:34:24,931 --> 00:34:27,301
BANSHEE: About 10 months ago,
DeMarcus and I

647
00:34:27,368 --> 00:34:29,103
were on a sortie providing
air support

648
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:30,703
to rebel fighters
on the ground

649
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:33,307
trying to overthrow
that son of a bitch

650
00:34:33,374 --> 00:34:35,443
they got in charge over there.

651
00:34:35,509 --> 00:34:37,044
Their so-called president,

652
00:34:37,111 --> 00:34:39,013
Artosk.

653
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,615
The man is a sadist,
a butcher.

654
00:34:42,682 --> 00:34:44,918
We call him
the Volodrezjkan Viper.

655
00:34:48,422 --> 00:34:52,159
Our planes had
the Hat Trick tech installed.

656
00:34:52,226 --> 00:34:54,661
When it was initiated,

657
00:34:54,727 --> 00:34:58,432
Demon's plane
essentially froze up.

658
00:34:58,499 --> 00:34:59,999
There was a glitch,

659
00:35:00,067 --> 00:35:03,703
and he was shot down
by the Volodrezjkan Air Force.

660
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:05,406
Because my AI failed.

661
00:35:05,473 --> 00:35:06,773
<i>Hang on, I got him!</i>

662
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,176
I told them it wasn't
quite ready yet.

663
00:35:09,243 --> 00:35:11,178
I told them
it needed more testing.

664
00:35:11,245 --> 00:35:14,614
You think the Pentagon
gave a damn?

665
00:35:14,681 --> 00:35:16,649
And now I've been butting heads

666
00:35:16,716 --> 00:35:18,052
with their frickin'
advisory board

667
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:19,953
for the last year trying
to get them to keep

668
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,423
searching for the wreckage
of Demon's plane.

669
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:25,593
At least figure out if
the tech burnt up,

670
00:35:25,658 --> 00:35:27,061
or if it was intercepted

671
00:35:27,128 --> 00:35:29,096
somewhere on
the coastal mountain range.

672
00:35:29,163 --> 00:35:32,333
[chuckles] And you know
what the Pentagon says?

673
00:35:32,399 --> 00:35:35,869
"Oh, Project Hat Trick
remains top priority."

674
00:35:35,935 --> 00:35:39,406
Yeah, it's such a top priority,
they can't even find it.

675
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,543
Bastards are fumbling
around in the dark

676
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:44,777
without guys like
me and Demon.

677
00:35:47,881 --> 00:35:51,385
This morning,
Coastal Air Flight 2191

678
00:35:51,452 --> 00:35:54,821
was targeted by a group
of right-wing radicals.

679
00:35:54,888 --> 00:35:56,990
They go by the name
Pavdekshem.

680
00:35:57,057 --> 00:36:01,328
They were able to get
an IED aboard this flight.

681
00:36:01,395 --> 00:36:03,897
It's in the air right now.

682
00:36:03,963 --> 00:36:06,400
These radicals
that we're up against,

683
00:36:06,467 --> 00:36:09,236
they were exiled from
their home country.

684
00:36:09,303 --> 00:36:11,771
And we have very credible proof
that they're hiding out

685
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:14,141
in Volodrezjka.

686
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,177
They're hiding in Volodrezjka?

687
00:36:16,243 --> 00:36:18,579
Yes.

688
00:36:18,646 --> 00:36:24,018
How they actually got and hacked
the TSA security clearance

689
00:36:24,084 --> 00:36:26,920
was through military grade
artificial intelligence.

690
00:36:28,988 --> 00:36:31,891
Major, is that tech yours?

691
00:36:33,693 --> 00:36:35,728
God, I hope not.

692
00:36:35,795 --> 00:36:39,133
Miss, please,
we need your help.

693
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,935
Hundreds of lives
hang in the balance.

694
00:36:59,653 --> 00:37:00,820
Mr. Garrett.

695
00:37:00,887 --> 00:37:03,723
Okay, you got me.

696
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:05,725
Come with me.

697
00:37:15,835 --> 00:37:18,072
So what is this,
you gonna arrest me now?

698
00:37:18,138 --> 00:37:21,008
Mr. Garrett, Tony Wilkes,
Air Marshal.

699
00:37:21,075 --> 00:37:23,344
So he's not arresting me.

700
00:37:24,478 --> 00:37:26,879
Look, you need to
understand my position.

701
00:37:26,946 --> 00:37:29,283
We've been notified that there's
an item on board.

702
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:31,619
It's my duty
to protect everyone,

703
00:37:31,685 --> 00:37:33,287
and everyone is a suspect.

704
00:37:33,354 --> 00:37:36,190
Especially someone who's willing
to help without being asked

705
00:37:36,257 --> 00:37:38,058
and has demonstrated
an awareness of

706
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:41,629
internal airline protocols
in situations such as this.

707
00:37:41,695 --> 00:37:45,199
Look, when you put it that way,
it does sound suspicious.

708
00:37:45,266 --> 00:37:48,702
Well, with all that aside,
was I right?

709
00:37:48,768 --> 00:37:50,704
Your experience and expertise

710
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:55,242
in this type of situation
would help a lot right now.

711
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,345
Let's find this thing.

712
00:37:58,412 --> 00:38:00,414
[rumbling]

713
00:38:01,948 --> 00:38:03,517
What is it?
What's wrong?

714
00:38:03,584 --> 00:38:07,954
Nothing, I'll just feel better
once we find this IED.

715
00:38:08,022 --> 00:38:09,922
Rough turbulence can
sometimes set it off

716
00:38:09,989 --> 00:38:11,625
if it's sensitive enough.

717
00:38:11,692 --> 00:38:14,328
[rumbling]

718
00:38:16,196 --> 00:38:17,698
Okay, look,
if you locate the IED,

719
00:38:17,765 --> 00:38:19,667
don't move it, don't touch it.

720
00:38:19,733 --> 00:38:20,768
Just leave it be.

721
00:38:20,833 --> 00:38:22,336
What's an IED?

722
00:38:22,403 --> 00:38:25,306
It's a device made up
of otherwise harmless items,

723
00:38:25,372 --> 00:38:28,542
but expertly combined to inflict
as much damage as possible.

724
00:38:30,177 --> 00:38:31,978
Let's go.

725
00:38:37,884 --> 00:38:39,420
I wanna check back here.

726
00:39:03,644 --> 00:39:05,179
Augh!

727
00:39:46,754 --> 00:39:48,288
[keystrokes]

728
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:53,293
Wow, Major Banning.

729
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,429
Captain, we have
a situation.

730
00:39:55,496 --> 00:39:56,497
This is the FBI.

731
00:39:56,563 --> 00:39:59,032
Special Agent Dietz,
Agent Smith.

732
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:01,201
-What's going on?
-They've just informed me

733
00:40:01,268 --> 00:40:04,071
that there's an active bomb
threat on a commercial airliner.

734
00:40:04,138 --> 00:40:06,573
And the terror group responsible

735
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,177
used military grade AI
to get past TSA.

736
00:40:11,612 --> 00:40:13,013
You're serious?

737
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,148
There's more.

738
00:40:14,214 --> 00:40:16,650
This group has ties to Volo.

739
00:40:16,717 --> 00:40:17,950
Where did this happen?

740
00:40:18,018 --> 00:40:19,753
JFK Airport.

741
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:22,623
TSA reports that the breach
was swift and accurate.

742
00:40:22,689 --> 00:40:25,426
So this AI,
it's designed to go in jets?

743
00:40:25,492 --> 00:40:28,629
-Like to fly them?
-Pilots fly.

744
00:40:28,695 --> 00:40:31,632
The AI must remain subordinate
to the pilot.

745
00:40:31,698 --> 00:40:33,667
If you remove pilots
from the equation,

746
00:40:33,734 --> 00:40:36,770
you're no longer creating a
superior fighting force of men.

747
00:40:36,837 --> 00:40:40,140
You're building heavily armed
war machines running on software

748
00:40:40,207 --> 00:40:43,277
too unpredictable to be
relied upon for combat yet.

749
00:40:44,678 --> 00:40:46,547
Why is it so unpredictable?

750
00:40:46,613 --> 00:40:50,617
The AI algorithms work
in simulated combat scenarios.

751
00:40:50,684 --> 00:40:52,786
We have yet to fully develop
what would happen

752
00:40:52,853 --> 00:40:55,489
in real world
combat scenarios.

753
00:40:55,556 --> 00:41:00,360
So the computer brain acts more
like a wingman than a pilot.

754
00:41:00,427 --> 00:41:02,995
And don't let anybody
tell you otherwise.

755
00:41:03,063 --> 00:41:05,566
A commercial airliner
has live ordnance on it.

756
00:41:05,632 --> 00:41:08,502
So I assume the SOP is
to bring it back to JFK?

757
00:41:08,569 --> 00:41:10,904
That's correct.

758
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:12,439
Fuel dumping over
the Atlantic.

759
00:41:12,506 --> 00:41:14,675
We can't risk it going to
a lower elevation airport

760
00:41:14,741 --> 00:41:16,343
and endangering other lives.

761
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:19,313
SOP would also dictate
it requires a military escort

762
00:41:19,379 --> 00:41:21,081
to return it to origin.

763
00:41:21,148 --> 00:41:23,217
Are you commandeering orders

764
00:41:23,283 --> 00:41:24,751
that have yet
to be assigned?

765
00:41:24,818 --> 00:41:26,687
Just call it thinking ahead.

766
00:41:26,753 --> 00:41:28,589
NORAD is bound to issue
the order any minute.

767
00:41:28,655 --> 00:41:31,358
Our location makes us
the most likely to get it.

768
00:41:31,425 --> 00:41:33,594
We might as well accept
in advance.

769
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:37,664
Okay.

770
00:41:41,635 --> 00:41:44,204
<i>This is Banshee and Smoke,</i>
<i>we're in the air.</i>

771
00:41:46,807 --> 00:41:50,110
<i>Stay alert for enemy bogeys.</i>

772
00:41:55,616 --> 00:41:58,719
<i>Coastal 2-1-Niner-1,</i>
<i>be advised you'll be joined by</i>

773
00:41:58,785 --> 00:42:00,220
<i>military escort</i>
<i>to bring you in.</i>

774
00:42:00,287 --> 00:42:02,422
<i>ETA 10 minutes</i>
<i>due to weather.</i>

775
00:42:02,489 --> 00:42:04,858
Tower, this is Coastal.
Copy that.

776
00:42:04,925 --> 00:42:06,693
Storm is messing
everything up.

777
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,629
Both cabins have been
swept for the IED.

778
00:42:08,695 --> 00:42:09,963
We haven't checked

779
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,465
the passengers' carry-ons,
obviously.

780
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,203
We've got about 10 minutes left
on this fuel dump

781
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:18,405
before we reach
the approved landing weight.

782
00:42:18,472 --> 00:42:19,740
Then...

783
00:42:19,806 --> 00:42:21,375
Then we'll get the passengers
ready for descent.

784
00:42:21,441 --> 00:42:23,710
They're asking
a lot of questions already.

785
00:42:23,777 --> 00:42:25,345
They can wait 10 more minutes
until we check

786
00:42:25,412 --> 00:42:27,147
the baggage compartment
down below.

787
00:42:27,214 --> 00:42:29,116
The Air Marshal
and one of the passengers

788
00:42:29,182 --> 00:42:30,651
has agreed to go look for it.

789
00:42:30,717 --> 00:42:32,152
What, are you kidding?

790
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:33,287
We can't allow a passenger
to go down there.

791
00:42:33,353 --> 00:42:34,988
His name is Taylor Garrett.

792
00:42:35,055 --> 00:42:36,423
He's a retired army sergeant

793
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:39,660
who used to work on
these type of IEDs.

794
00:42:39,726 --> 00:42:41,762
So he has the skills
and the training

795
00:42:41,828 --> 00:42:43,397
to build something like this.

796
00:42:43,463 --> 00:42:44,898
Which means he has a training

797
00:42:44,965 --> 00:42:47,534
and he knows how to disarm
something like this.

798
00:42:47,601 --> 00:42:50,771
Look, Air Marshal Wilkes
has checked with TSA.

799
00:42:50,837 --> 00:42:52,339
He's clean, and...

800
00:42:52,406 --> 00:42:55,842
he's the best and only expert
we have right now.

801
00:42:55,909 --> 00:42:58,245
Captain,
it's your decision.

802
00:42:58,312 --> 00:43:00,881
But if we can find this thing
before we land,

803
00:43:00,948 --> 00:43:03,183
we can give TSA a head start
on dealing with it.

804
00:43:05,686 --> 00:43:09,023
All right, but I want those
passengers back in their seats

805
00:43:09,122 --> 00:43:10,757
by initial descent.

806
00:43:10,824 --> 00:43:12,526
We've only got 10 minutes.

807
00:43:12,593 --> 00:43:14,161
Understood.

808
00:43:18,365 --> 00:43:20,500
-What's the verdict?
-You can both go

809
00:43:20,567 --> 00:43:22,369
down to baggage and sweep
the area together, but hurry.

810
00:43:22,436 --> 00:43:24,504
We only have about
nine minutes.

811
00:43:24,571 --> 00:43:28,408
I'll have you hold onto this.

812
00:43:31,012 --> 00:43:32,779
Follow me.

813
00:43:42,756 --> 00:43:44,424
Excuse me, I'm trying
to get to the restroom.

814
00:43:44,491 --> 00:43:45,926
I'm trying to get
to the restroom--

815
00:43:45,993 --> 00:43:47,961
If I don't use it,
I'ma use it on myself, okay?

816
00:43:48,029 --> 00:43:49,563
Get off of me.

817
00:44:01,141 --> 00:44:02,676
Down the hatch.

818
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:18,659
Hey, we'll find it.

819
00:44:22,596 --> 00:44:24,765
Uh, $60 extra and
I can't use the bathroom?

820
00:44:24,831 --> 00:44:26,299
I'm sorry, this one's
out of order.

821
00:44:26,366 --> 00:44:27,834
The toilet not
flushing properly...

822
00:44:27,901 --> 00:44:29,469
That's fine, I-- look...

823
00:44:33,674 --> 00:44:36,077
<i>Coastal Air,</i>
<i>this is Cobra 1.</i>

824
00:44:36,144 --> 00:44:38,845
We're here to help bring you
down safe and sound.

825
00:44:38,912 --> 00:44:40,881
Cobra 1, this is Coastal.

826
00:44:40,947 --> 00:44:43,684
You don't know how happy I am
to hear that.

827
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:50,757
Hey, excuse me,
flight attendant.

828
00:44:50,824 --> 00:44:51,758
Yes, sir?

829
00:44:51,825 --> 00:44:53,660
Uh, is there problem?

830
00:44:53,727 --> 00:44:55,829
Pilots have not said anything.

831
00:44:55,896 --> 00:44:58,365
And maybe you could tell us
what's happening.

832
00:44:58,432 --> 00:45:01,535
[all murmuring]

833
00:45:01,601 --> 00:45:03,603
Uh, I have no other
information.

834
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:05,439
I only know what
you know at this time.

835
00:45:05,505 --> 00:45:07,574
-Oh, come on!
-Please, please--

836
00:45:07,641 --> 00:45:09,643
I'm sorry, look, I'll go
ask the flight deck

837
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:11,344
for an update
as soon as possible.

838
00:45:11,411 --> 00:45:13,147
I want to know
as badly as you.

839
00:45:13,213 --> 00:45:14,848
[murmuring continues]

840
00:45:14,915 --> 00:45:16,750
Please. Please.

841
00:45:28,929 --> 00:45:32,133
Cobra 2, I've got a pair
of bogeys on approach

842
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,735
coming in 0-8-0,
westbound.

843
00:45:36,104 --> 00:45:38,072
Affirmative. Due west.

844
00:45:38,139 --> 00:45:40,240
19 miles out.

845
00:45:45,612 --> 00:45:48,082
-[jet whirring]
-Those are fighter jets!

846
00:45:48,149 --> 00:45:50,450
What's going on?

847
00:45:52,919 --> 00:45:54,354
It's freezing down here.

848
00:45:54,421 --> 00:45:56,157
Yeah, well,
if we're gonna be

849
00:45:56,224 --> 00:45:57,491
moving these bags around,

850
00:45:57,557 --> 00:45:59,292
we'll break out
in a sweat.

851
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:02,596
They must have made a killing
overweight bag fees today.

852
00:46:12,973 --> 00:46:15,675
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what is that?
What'd you just pick up?

853
00:46:16,543 --> 00:46:18,045
You smell that?

854
00:46:18,112 --> 00:46:19,379
It's acetone.

855
00:46:19,446 --> 00:46:21,048
I smell it now.

856
00:46:21,115 --> 00:46:23,784
Do not drop that bag.

857
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:26,553
All right, we're gonna
set this down real easy, okay?

858
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:29,389
Nice and easy.
Very gentle.

859
00:46:29,456 --> 00:46:32,893
That's triacetone triperoxide
in the detonator.

860
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:36,663
TATP? That's the same shit
that the shoe bomber used.

861
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:39,933
Yeah, except there's
a lot more of it in here.

862
00:46:41,401 --> 00:46:44,704
Hey, this bag didn't
go through security.

863
00:46:44,771 --> 00:46:46,207
There's no baggage
check tag on here.

864
00:46:46,274 --> 00:46:48,475
That's a clue.

865
00:46:49,776 --> 00:46:51,444
All right.

866
00:46:54,981 --> 00:46:56,416
Okay.

867
00:46:56,483 --> 00:46:59,686
I don't see any wires or pins.

868
00:46:59,753 --> 00:47:01,521
I think it's safe to open.

869
00:47:02,956 --> 00:47:04,691
I need something sharp,
I'm gonna cut through this bag.

870
00:47:04,758 --> 00:47:06,593
The zippers could be rigged.

871
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:11,965
Never leave home without 'em.

872
00:47:12,033 --> 00:47:15,036
Thatta boy,
always be prepared.

873
00:47:27,547 --> 00:47:30,184
We got a barometric IED.

874
00:47:30,251 --> 00:47:32,053
It's a live weapon.

875
00:47:34,855 --> 00:47:36,489
Okay...

876
00:47:36,556 --> 00:47:38,358
we need to pile up
these suitcases and bags.

877
00:47:38,425 --> 00:47:41,962
Form a kind of barricade
to, you know,

878
00:47:42,029 --> 00:47:44,031
absorb some-- if something
goes horribly wrong.

879
00:47:47,335 --> 00:47:49,836
Let's start stacking these up.

880
00:47:49,903 --> 00:47:51,438
Very carefully.

881
00:47:51,504 --> 00:47:54,608
Look, just be careful
going near the IED.

882
00:47:54,674 --> 00:47:55,909
Don't touch anything.

883
00:47:55,976 --> 00:47:58,411
Shouldn't we move this
to an LRBL?

884
00:47:58,478 --> 00:48:00,248
No, not right now,
a sudden movement

885
00:48:00,314 --> 00:48:01,982
could make it detonate.

886
00:48:02,049 --> 00:48:04,885
We'll try moving it to
a least risk bomb location

887
00:48:04,951 --> 00:48:06,686
once I figure out what
we're dealing with.

888
00:48:06,753 --> 00:48:10,124
Let's just hope this
is the only one onboard.

889
00:48:10,191 --> 00:48:12,392
[thunder]

890
00:48:14,694 --> 00:48:16,297
Let's just stack
these carefully.

891
00:48:16,364 --> 00:48:18,498
We can't have them collapsing
down on top of the IED.

892
00:48:18,565 --> 00:48:20,101
Otherwise, it's goodnight.

893
00:48:24,404 --> 00:48:25,772
So, Vanessa, we have the IED.

894
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:27,774
<i>It's in baggage</i>
<i>and it's armed.</i>

895
00:48:27,841 --> 00:48:30,911
-Can we disarm it?
-Can you disarm it?

896
00:48:30,977 --> 00:48:32,779
-This is garbage, man.
-Where are we supposed to go?

897
00:48:32,846 --> 00:48:34,848
I'm sorry, please, there's more
lavatories in the back.

898
00:48:34,915 --> 00:48:37,018
This one's out of order
right now, okay?

899
00:48:37,084 --> 00:48:38,718
Stand by.

900
00:48:38,785 --> 00:48:40,553
We're about to find out.

901
00:48:42,889 --> 00:48:44,591
Careful.

902
00:48:52,532 --> 00:48:54,168
Okay, the IED is armed

903
00:48:54,235 --> 00:48:56,937
with an Aneroid Altimeter.

904
00:48:57,004 --> 00:48:58,838
It's detecting changes
in altitude.

905
00:48:58,905 --> 00:49:00,540
That definitely armed the thing.

906
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:05,578
Mother of Satan.

907
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,149
Don't.

908
00:49:08,215 --> 00:49:11,052
It's very sensitive
to impact infriction.

909
00:49:11,118 --> 00:49:14,055
There's enough in here
to tear the plane apart.

910
00:49:14,121 --> 00:49:15,323
But I already moved it.

911
00:49:15,389 --> 00:49:16,957
Well, now that
the bag is open,

912
00:49:17,024 --> 00:49:19,859
it's more sensitive to
pressure changes and abrasion.

913
00:49:19,926 --> 00:49:21,528
Just stay there.

914
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:29,103
All right,
there's a signal box.

915
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:30,937
A signal box?

916
00:49:31,005 --> 00:49:33,107
What kind of signal
is it emitting?

917
00:49:33,174 --> 00:49:34,641
No, it's not emitting.

918
00:49:34,708 --> 00:49:36,643
It's detecting signals.

919
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:38,145
They set it up as
a trigger for the IED.

920
00:49:38,212 --> 00:49:40,480
If that's the trigger,
where's the signal?

921
00:49:40,547 --> 00:49:42,882
It's reading electrical signals

922
00:49:42,949 --> 00:49:45,286
from LVDT and RVDT sensors.

923
00:49:45,353 --> 00:49:47,487
I saw this all the time
in Kabul

924
00:49:47,554 --> 00:49:49,156
on our patrol
in Helmand Province.

925
00:49:49,223 --> 00:49:52,525
Wh-What are the sensors?

926
00:49:52,592 --> 00:49:54,894
They're electromechanical
transducers.

927
00:49:54,961 --> 00:49:56,796
They convert rectilinear
motion of objects

928
00:49:56,863 --> 00:49:58,165
into electrical signals.

929
00:49:58,232 --> 00:50:00,101
Aircrafts like this
are full of them.

930
00:50:00,167 --> 00:50:02,602
Why? What for?

931
00:50:02,669 --> 00:50:04,537
Well, they make sure that
the flight controls,

932
00:50:04,604 --> 00:50:08,142
all the systems are
operating properly.

933
00:50:08,209 --> 00:50:12,279
So that box, it detects
electrical signals?

934
00:50:12,346 --> 00:50:14,981
Yes.

935
00:50:15,049 --> 00:50:16,484
Well, if the plane
hasn't blown up,

936
00:50:16,549 --> 00:50:18,785
it hasn't gotten
the right signal, right?

937
00:50:20,087 --> 00:50:22,089
That's correct.

938
00:50:22,156 --> 00:50:24,557
So what signal
is it waiting for?

939
00:50:24,624 --> 00:50:25,792
We're at landing weight.
Vanessa, get them back

940
00:50:25,859 --> 00:50:27,361

We're gonna land.

941
00:50:27,428 --> 00:50:29,163

to begin our descent.

<i>to get back up here, copy?</i>

943
00:50:31,165 --> 00:50:32,500
Now wait a minute.

944
00:50:32,565 --> 00:50:35,702
You said that these sensors
are all over the plane.

945
00:50:35,769 --> 00:50:37,171
-Right?
-Yeah, y--

946
00:50:37,238 --> 00:50:40,241
And they make sure
that the flight controls

947
00:50:40,307 --> 00:50:42,675
and the mechanical structures
are working, right?

948
00:50:42,742 --> 00:50:45,845
Yeah, yoke, foot pedals,
thrust levers, you name it.

949
00:50:45,912 --> 00:50:50,317
What parts of the plane with
these sensors aren't being used?

950
00:50:50,384 --> 00:50:52,786
No, they're all in use.

951
00:50:52,852 --> 00:50:55,089
Since this thing
has become active.

952
00:50:56,990 --> 00:50:59,859
It's the landing gear.
It's gotta be the landing gear.

953
00:50:59,926 --> 00:51:01,495
The landing gear is
a mechanical structure

954
00:51:01,561 --> 00:51:03,097
-and has those sensors?
-Yes.

955
00:51:03,164 --> 00:51:05,965
There's a sensor in
the nose wheel steering column.

956
00:51:06,033 --> 00:51:09,303
The landing gear was retracted
when the IED was armed.

957

when you try to touch down.

1053
00:56:28,322 --> 00:56:30,657
<i>The slightest nudge might</i>
<i>detonate them.</i>

1054
00:56:33,694 --> 00:56:34,961
We lost Wilkes.

1055
00:56:36,263 --> 00:56:37,997
What? What happened?

1056
00:56:39,566 --> 00:56:41,335
When the IED sent
the remote beacon to arm

1057
00:56:41,402 --> 00:56:44,571
the charges in the other bags,

1058
00:56:44,638 --> 00:56:46,840
Tony caught one,

1059
00:56:46,906 --> 00:56:49,143
prevented it
from falling on the IED.

1060
00:56:49,209 --> 00:56:52,179
Shielded it with his own body.

1061
00:56:52,246 --> 00:56:53,980
He saved the plane.

1062
00:56:56,116 --> 00:56:58,318
The man went out a hero.

1063
00:57:02,489 --> 00:57:06,393
<i>Listen, Taylor, I've been</i>
<i>flying for eight years.</i>

1064
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:09,229
<i>I think I can handle</i>
<i>a smooth landing.</i>

1065
00:57:09,296 --> 00:57:11,465
Yeah, and I've been dealing
with this stuff for 12.

1066
00:57:11,532 --> 00:57:13,834
This has nothing to do with
your landing abilities.

1067
00:57:13,901 --> 00:57:15,469
We're gonna have
to land in the storm.

1068
00:57:15,536 --> 00:57:17,171
Even if the weather clears,
it's windy

1069
00:57:17,237 --> 00:57:19,139
and the runway is wet.

1070
00:57:19,206 --> 00:57:22,042
You'll need to descend faster
than five feet per second

1071
00:57:22,109 --> 00:57:24,077
just to stop hydroplaning.

1072
00:57:24,144 --> 00:57:26,180
He's right,
we'd have to execute

1073
00:57:26,246 --> 00:57:27,815
a positive landing
at that rate of speed.

1074
00:57:27,881 --> 00:57:29,616
<i>Look, we don't know what</i>
<i>failsafes these terrorists</i>

1075
00:57:29,683 --> 00:57:31,718
<i>have installed elsewhere</i>
<i>in the plane,</i>

1076
00:57:31,785 --> 00:57:33,754
<i>but until we can do</i>
<i>a scan of the entire aircraft</i>

1077
00:57:33,821 --> 00:57:36,323
<i>we have to assume</i>
<i>it's not safe to land.</i>

1078
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:39,226
Sophie, what's AWC saying?

1079
00:57:41,395 --> 00:57:43,564
Advisory's still in effect
for the Tri-State area

1080
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:45,599
until 8:30 p.m.

1081
00:57:47,067 --> 00:57:50,504
Okay, so what do you
suggest we do?

1082
00:57:50,571 --> 00:57:54,775
Look, we don't have the luxury
of a proper disposal.

1083
00:57:54,842 --> 00:57:57,845
I have to throw it out of
the plane over the ocean.

1084
00:57:57,911 --> 00:57:59,246
But first we're gonna
shield it.

1085
00:57:59,313 --> 00:58:01,715
Better let JFK know
what's going on.

1086
00:58:01,782 --> 00:58:03,517
<i>Yeah, I'll need to</i>
<i>transfer the IED</i>

1087
00:58:03,584 --> 00:58:05,752
<i>to one of these</i>
<i>hard shell suitcases.</i>

1088
00:58:05,819 --> 00:58:07,287
[shudders]

1089
00:58:07,354 --> 00:58:09,790
-Vanessa?
-I'm sorry.

1090
00:58:09,857 --> 00:58:11,458
I'm--I'll be all right.

1091
00:58:12,926 --> 00:58:14,862
I hate to say it,

1092
00:58:14,928 --> 00:58:16,864
but were we wrong
to trust Taylor?

1093
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:18,699
No, he was vetted by ATC

1094
00:58:18,765 --> 00:58:22,269
and he put his life at risk
to go down there.

1095
00:58:22,336 --> 00:58:23,770
If he wanted to
blow up the plane,

1096
00:58:23,837 --> 00:58:26,173
he would've done it already.

1097
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,542
Besides, none of us know
how to defuse a bomb.

1098
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:31,745
You're right.

1099
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:34,548
-Do you need a minute?
-No, sorry.

1100
00:58:34,615 --> 00:58:37,351
I'm--I'm all right.

1101
00:58:37,417 --> 00:58:38,752
Taylor, I can show you
where the designated

1102
00:58:38,819 --> 00:58:40,420
LRVL is on the plane.

1103
00:58:40,487 --> 00:58:44,691
There is a cabin closet
in the bulkhead divider

1104
00:58:44,758 --> 00:58:45,993
at the rear galley.

1105
00:58:46,059 --> 00:58:47,561
No, look, we can't
take that risk.

1106
00:58:47,628 --> 00:58:50,597
I'll have to pack it up
and toss it out down here.

1107
00:58:50,664 --> 00:58:53,500
Tower, this is
Coastal 2-1-Niner-1.

1108
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:56,036
<i>The explosive device</i>
<i>has been defused.</i>

1109
00:58:56,103 --> 00:59:00,641
<i>However, it is too unstable</i>
<i>to land at this time.</i>

1110
00:59:00,707 --> 00:59:03,677
We are going to try to dispose
of the device in midair.

1111
00:59:03,744 --> 00:59:05,112
Do you copy?

1112
00:59:05,178 --> 00:59:08,215
Coastal, what is your
current fuel level?

1113
00:59:08,282 --> 00:59:10,317
Did they disable it?

1114
00:59:10,384 --> 00:59:11,785
Reroute all your planes

1115
00:59:11,852 --> 00:59:14,621
for vertical and horizontal
separation.

1116
00:59:14,688 --> 00:59:17,057
They found the device
and disabled it,

1117
00:59:17,124 --> 00:59:18,358
but they don't know if the bomb

1118
00:59:18,425 --> 00:59:20,694
could be reactivated
on landing.

1119
00:59:21,895 --> 00:59:24,698
So what are they going to do?

1120
00:59:24,765 --> 00:59:27,501
They're gonna drop them
from the plane.

1121
00:59:28,468 --> 00:59:31,772
Better alert the Coast Guard.

1122
00:59:31,838 --> 00:59:34,575
Have them clear all the ships
and vessels from the area.

1123
00:59:41,915 --> 00:59:43,650
Yeah, this'll work.

1124
00:59:46,587 --> 00:59:49,523
Coastal 2-1-Niner-1, I have
an unidentified aircraft

1125
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:53,760
moving your way extremely fast
along heading 1-2-5.

1126
00:59:58,131 --> 01:00:00,300
Cobra 2, I've got
an unidentified aircraft

1127
01:00:00,367 --> 01:00:03,170
approaching at 1-2-5.
You seein' this?

1128
01:00:03,236 --> 01:00:05,272
I've got that same bogey
coming in real hot

1129
01:00:05,339 --> 01:00:07,441
on 1-2-5, 18 miles.

1130
01:00:07,507 --> 01:00:09,943
What is it doing here?

1131
01:00:10,011 --> 01:00:12,779
[MiG roaring]

1132
01:00:17,284 --> 01:00:21,788
Cobra 2, bogey,
bandit moving westbound.

1133
01:00:21,855 --> 01:00:23,757
Appears he's on his own.

1134
01:00:23,824 --> 01:00:26,193
Copy, Cobra 1.
Proceeding as threat hostile.

1135
01:00:26,259 --> 01:00:27,594
Threat hostile!

1136
01:00:36,737 --> 01:00:39,206
Cobra 2, arm hot.

1137
01:00:39,272 --> 01:00:42,509
Tower, this is
Coastal 2-1-Niner-1.

1138
01:00:42,576 --> 01:00:44,978
Just got a visual
on that bogey from earlier.

1139
01:00:45,046 --> 01:00:47,614
Cobra 2.
Fox 1!

1140
01:00:55,522 --> 01:00:58,492
Cobra 2, he's on me.

1141
01:01:03,997 --> 01:01:06,600
Cobra 2,
MiG staying on me.

1142
01:01:06,667 --> 01:01:09,436
The guy won't let me out
of the defensive.

1143
01:01:13,107 --> 01:01:15,208
[power surge, beeping]

1144
01:01:17,344 --> 01:01:18,945
Cobra 2, Fox 3!

01:01:22,983 --> 01:01:24,118
[explosion]

1146
01:01:24,184 --> 01:01:25,886
Yes! Splash one!

1147
01:01:25,952 --> 01:01:28,555
Splash one! Whooo!

1148
01:01:28,622 --> 01:01:31,092
Cobra 2, return to escort
immediately.

1149
01:01:31,159 --> 01:01:32,859
Copy that.

1150
01:01:32,926 --> 01:01:34,761
That was a Volodrezjkan MiG.

1151
01:01:34,828 --> 01:01:39,433
Our bogey was buzzing
an American airliner?

1152
01:01:39,499 --> 01:01:41,135
We may be over
international waters,

1153
01:01:41,201 --> 01:01:43,236
but he's a long way
from the Bahamas.

1154
01:01:45,139 --> 01:01:47,674
<i>Coastal Air,</i>
<i>this is Cobra 1.</i>

1155
01:01:47,741 --> 01:01:49,276
<i>We just encountered</i>

1156
01:01:49,342 --> 01:01:50,944
<i>entering our airspace.</i>

1157
01:01:51,012 --> 01:01:52,879
<i>Do you have any further</i>

<i>of the threat against</i>

please be advised,
we have been given

1161

no further information about
the threat at this time.

01:02:06,927 --> 01:02:09,262
Cobra 1, we have
nothing that would be

1165
01:02:09,329 --> 01:02:11,431
of interest on the vessel.

1166
01:02:11,498 --> 01:02:13,533
No persons of interest.

1167
01:02:14,434 --> 01:02:17,437
Maybe... the bomb?

Hey, nobody goes
in there, all right?

1169
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,248
It's out of order,

Mm-hmm, and the crash axe

is in the flight deck,
I'll go get it.

1178

All right.

How's it going out there?

01:03:18,565 --> 01:03:19,833
Passengers are getting angry,
they're scared,

1181

and to be honest,
I don't blame them.

1220
01:05:00,567 --> 01:05:02,069
-Okay, stay calm.
-All right, hold him.

1221
01:05:02,136 --> 01:05:04,671
[overlapping shouting]

1222
01:05:04,738 --> 01:05:06,606
-Hold him, hold him!
-Get off of me!

1223
01:05:06,673 --> 01:05:08,808
-It's all right!
-They're gonna kill us!

1224
01:05:08,875 --> 01:05:11,645
You're gonna let 'em kill us!
You're gonna let 'em kill us!

1225
01:05:11,711 --> 01:05:13,381
[shouting continues]

1226
01:05:13,446 --> 01:05:15,749
They've got him back
from the door.

1227
01:05:15,815 --> 01:05:17,784
It's okay. It's okay.

1228
01:05:17,851 --> 01:05:19,653
They're gonna kill us all!

1229
01:05:19,719 --> 01:05:21,655
Okay, calm down,
calm down!

1230
01:05:31,165 --> 01:05:34,768
I'm fine, really.
I am, I am, I just...

1231
01:05:34,834 --> 01:05:36,404
I just lost--I lost my head
for a second.

1232
01:05:36,469 --> 01:05:38,638
But I'm fine now, I am.

1233
01:05:38,705 --> 01:05:40,707
I know, I know.
I just want to make sure you

1234
01:05:40,774 --> 01:05:44,011
and all the other passengers
feel safe, okay?

1235
01:05:44,078 --> 01:05:45,779
You can go ahead
and take your seat, sir.

1236
01:05:45,845 --> 01:05:47,381
Fasten your seat belt,
thank you so much for your help.

1237
01:05:47,447 --> 01:05:49,849
-Is he going to be all right?
-Yes.

1238
01:05:49,916 --> 01:05:52,719
I'ma be fine soon as
he done feeling me up.

1239
01:05:57,524 --> 01:05:59,526
Hey.

1240
01:05:59,592 --> 01:06:01,795
Thanks for stepping up
to help me.

1241
01:06:02,595 --> 01:06:03,997
Taylor.

1242
01:06:05,232 --> 01:06:08,302
I'm Peter.

1243
01:06:08,369 --> 01:06:09,803
Just goes to show,

1244
01:06:09,869 --> 01:06:11,805
you never know where
the threat is coming from.

1245
01:06:16,710 --> 01:06:19,213
Stewardess,
you have to untie me.

1246
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,048
You can't keep me here.
I'm a paying customer.

1247
01:06:21,115 --> 01:06:22,649
I know my rights.

1248
01:06:25,386 --> 01:06:26,753
That's mine.

1249
01:06:28,521 --> 01:06:29,823
That's mine.

1250
01:06:33,493 --> 01:06:36,263
It's clear, nothing here.

1251
01:06:39,033 --> 01:06:42,002
Who gave you the right
to just go through my stuff?

1252
01:06:42,069 --> 01:06:44,071
He's not our guy.

1253
01:06:48,242 --> 01:06:49,343
Hey!

1254
01:06:49,410 --> 01:06:51,578
I wanna see some credentials!

1255
01:06:51,644 --> 01:06:53,080
Credentials!

1256
01:06:53,147 --> 01:06:54,581
I want to see 'em!

1257
01:06:54,647 --> 01:06:56,183
[deep breathing]

1258
01:07:04,325 --> 01:07:06,559
WOLFE: Okay, we'll be waiting
on that email.

1259
01:07:06,626 --> 01:07:08,129
Two minutes, right?

1260
01:07:08,195 --> 01:07:09,896
Thanks.

1261
01:07:12,866 --> 01:07:15,969
Dietz, Wolfe.
Coastal Air is sending over

1262
01:07:16,037 --> 01:07:18,506
the passenger manifest
for 2191.

1263
01:07:18,571 --> 01:07:20,607
Send the manifest
to the field office.

1264
01:07:20,673 --> 01:07:24,412
When it arrives,
they'll cross-ref for flags.

1265
01:07:24,478 --> 01:07:27,081
Cobra 2, let's deploy left.

1266
01:07:27,148 --> 01:07:29,250
Meet 'em halfway.

1267
01:07:29,316 --> 01:07:30,850
Go burners.

1268
01:07:33,987 --> 01:07:36,990
Captain, that's two more
bogeys on approach.

1269
01:07:37,058 --> 01:07:40,727
Jesus, who are they?
What do they want?

1270
01:07:40,794 --> 01:07:43,330
Taylor, our military escort
just broke off to engage

1271
01:07:43,397 --> 01:07:45,199
more fighters. Whatever
you're doing, do it fast.

1272
01:07:45,266 --> 01:07:46,966
What are you doing down here?
It's not safe, go back up.

1273
01:07:47,034 --> 01:07:49,002
It's not safe for anyone
onboard, so just let me

1274
01:07:49,070 --> 01:07:51,172
help you. What are you doing,
why you chopping up suitcases?

1275
01:07:51,238 --> 01:07:53,706
It's mine.
It's got Kevlar panels.

1276
01:07:53,773 --> 01:07:56,843
It was a gift from
the guys in my unit.

1277
01:07:56,910 --> 01:07:59,280
Okay, look, help me quick
and then go back up.

1278
01:07:59,346 --> 01:08:01,515
All right, here.

1279
01:08:01,581 --> 01:08:02,849
Get the tape.

1280
01:08:02,916 --> 01:08:04,918
Tape it around my torso.

1281
01:08:06,020 --> 01:08:07,555
This is a makeshift blast suit,

1282
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:10,024
it's not much,
but it's all I got.

1283
01:08:10,091 --> 01:08:13,494
-There you go, yep.
-Tight? Okay.

1284
01:08:13,561 --> 01:08:18,099
Tower, this is
Coastal 2-1-Niner-1.

1285
01:08:18,165 --> 01:08:22,103
F-16s engaging bogeys on
two more aircraft.

1286
01:08:22,169 --> 01:08:26,507
I repeat, F-16s engaging bogeys
on two more aircraft.

1287
01:08:26,574 --> 01:08:28,175
-Okay, we good?
-Yeah.

1288
01:08:28,242 --> 01:08:30,277
-All right, now go back up.
-Okay.

1289
01:08:30,344 --> 01:08:31,945
Hey, stay on walkie.
I'll let you know

1290
01:08:32,012 --> 01:08:33,481
when I'm at
the compartment door.

1291
01:08:33,547 --> 01:08:36,117
And the captain needs to disarm
the outer door.

1292
01:08:36,183 --> 01:08:37,617
Okay, he's got us
at a low enough altitude

1293
01:08:37,684 --> 01:08:39,886
-for depressurization.
-Okay.

1294
01:08:48,728 --> 01:08:50,264
Oh, God.

1295
01:09:23,364 --> 01:09:25,032
[rapid gunfire]

1296
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:30,304
Cobra 2,
bandits heading 3-2-0.

1297
01:09:30,371 --> 01:09:31,572
I'm on MiG 1.

1298
01:09:31,639 --> 01:09:33,207
Copy 1, I'm on 2.

1299
01:09:35,942 --> 01:09:38,112
Cobra 2,
bogey bandits breaking.

1300
01:09:38,179 --> 01:09:41,081
-Stay on MiG 2.
-I'm on him!

1301
01:09:43,184 --> 01:09:44,951
[beeping]

1302
01:09:50,591 --> 01:09:52,326
Did you hear from
the field office?

1303
01:09:52,393 --> 01:09:55,029
Wolfe, we got a hit, we're
about to get on the chopper.

1304
01:09:55,095 --> 01:09:56,963
<i>Patch us through</i>
<i>to the plane.</i>

1305
01:09:57,031 --> 01:09:59,366
We know we have to keep
the ATC line open.

1306
01:09:59,433 --> 01:10:02,403
Try the cell numbers of
the flight crew on the manifest.

1307
01:10:02,469 --> 01:10:04,003
[cell phone ringing]

1308
01:10:05,673 --> 01:10:07,408
Hello, this is Vanessa Jensen.

1309
01:10:07,474 --> 01:10:10,177
Miss Jensen, this is
Special Agent Rico Dietz

1310
01:10:10,244 --> 01:10:12,079
of the FBI JTTF.

1311
01:10:12,146 --> 01:10:14,248
<i>We received a manifest</i>
<i>from Coastal Air.</i>

1312
01:10:14,315 --> 01:10:17,351
We had our office cross
reference every name on here.

1313
01:10:17,418 --> 01:10:18,952
<i>Peter Guren.</i>

1314
01:10:19,019 --> 01:10:21,021
He's part of an international
hacktivist collective

1315
01:10:21,088 --> 01:10:23,023
called Peanut Ravioli.

1316
01:10:23,090 --> 01:10:25,125
They go after
foreign governments,

1317
01:10:25,192 --> 01:10:28,895
religious groups, politicians,
anyone they deem corrupt.

1318
01:10:28,962 --> 01:10:31,265
He's on our plane?
Do you have a photo of him?

1319
01:10:31,332 --> 01:10:33,267
I'll text it to you now.

1320
01:10:39,906 --> 01:10:41,975
Cobra 2, he's on you.

1321
01:10:42,042 --> 01:10:43,510
Break away, evade.

1322
01:10:43,577 --> 01:10:44,777
I'll come up from behind.

1323
01:10:44,844 --> 01:10:46,614
They got us on
the defensive!

1324
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:48,349
Cobra 2...

1325
01:10:48,415 --> 01:10:51,252
Cobra 2, they're going
for 2-1-Niner-1.

1326
01:10:55,623 --> 01:10:57,324
They're firing on us!

1327
01:11:01,061 --> 01:11:02,762
[all screaming]

1328
01:11:20,281 --> 01:11:21,615
Gotcha!

1329
01:11:21,682 --> 01:11:23,217
MiG 1, splash!

1330
01:11:25,852 --> 01:11:28,155
There's nobody in it.

1331
01:11:28,222 --> 01:11:29,956
The Hat Trick AI targeting
system didn't burn up.

1332
01:11:30,024 --> 01:11:32,760
It was stolen.

1333
01:11:32,859 --> 01:11:35,229
<i>That's our tech!</i>

1334
01:11:35,296 --> 01:11:38,098
Cobra 1,
bandit 2 targeting Coastal.

1335
01:11:39,266 --> 01:11:42,136
Cobra 1, R-33's away,
on approach!

1336
01:11:43,604 --> 01:11:47,374
Oh, my God.
It's gonna hit that plane.

1337
01:11:47,441 --> 01:11:49,677
<i>There's nothing they can do,</i>
<i>they're just sitting ducks!</i>

1338
01:11:49,743 --> 01:11:50,877
Banshee...

1339
01:11:51,712 --> 01:11:53,380
<i>Finish this fight.</i>

1340
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:57,518
Cobra 2?

1341
01:11:57,584 --> 01:12:00,387
<i>[Smoke screaming]</i>

1342
01:12:01,888 --> 01:12:03,823
Cobra 2!

1343
01:12:10,863 --> 01:12:12,399
[beep]

1344
01:12:15,536 --> 01:12:18,439
Come on, Garrett,
get this thing off the plane!

1345
01:12:40,461 --> 01:12:42,629
-No, taken!
-Is that so, Pete?

1346
01:12:42,696 --> 01:12:45,733
Wanna tell me what you're doing
with a laptop in the lavatory?

1347
01:12:45,799 --> 01:12:48,502
-No, no...
-This is Piotr Gurin.

1348
01:12:48,569 --> 01:12:50,104
He look familiar to you?

1349
01:12:50,170 --> 01:12:52,005
Who sent you this?

1350
01:12:52,072 --> 01:12:54,608
-FBI?
-You're a suspect now.

1351
01:12:54,675 --> 01:12:56,643
Probably their only suspect.

1352
01:12:56,710 --> 01:12:58,911
You think I'm the one

1353
01:12:58,978 --> 01:13:00,414
who put bomb on plane?

1354
01:13:00,481 --> 01:13:02,915
No, I'm not trying
to blow up plane.

1355
01:13:02,982 --> 01:13:04,884
I need plane to get out
of New York.

1356
01:13:04,951 --> 01:13:08,988
-It is not safe for me there.
-Why? FBI closing in on you?

1357
01:13:09,056 --> 01:13:11,024
I need to get out of city.

1358
01:13:11,091 --> 01:13:12,526
Lay low, Dominican Republic.

1359
01:13:12,593 --> 01:13:14,461
Well, we are headed
back to JFK now.

1360
01:13:14,528 --> 01:13:16,463
I'm going to hold on to this,
and the FBI will deal with it

1361
01:13:16,530 --> 01:13:18,599
-when we get there.
-No, please, no, please.

1362
01:13:18,665 --> 01:13:21,034
I need that, please.

1363
01:13:21,101 --> 01:13:23,070
The plane, it didn't get
to cruising altitude.

1364
01:13:23,137 --> 01:13:25,606
No WiFi, I need to use VPN.

1365
01:13:25,672 --> 01:13:26,774
I can't do that.

1366
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:28,975
No, he has people.

1367
01:13:29,042 --> 01:13:30,844
He has people.

1368
01:13:30,910 --> 01:13:32,880
They are hunting us
one by one.

1369
01:13:32,945 --> 01:13:35,982
What are you talking about?

1370
01:13:36,049 --> 01:13:38,085
I am Volodrezjkan.

1371
01:13:38,152 --> 01:13:40,087
The Artosk regime
is coming after me,

1372
01:13:40,154 --> 01:13:42,089
and he has no problem
blowing up plane

1373
01:13:42,156 --> 01:13:44,892
full of Americans to do it.

1374
01:13:44,957 --> 01:13:48,028
Especially since your government
got involved with the rebels

1375
01:13:48,095 --> 01:13:49,163
who are fighting against him.

1376
01:13:49,229 --> 01:13:51,498
Why would he be after you?

1377
01:13:53,033 --> 01:13:55,968
I am a good guy.

1378
01:13:56,036 --> 01:13:59,406
I can prove it.
I can prove it.

1379
01:13:59,473 --> 01:14:02,342
Artosk regime turned
Volodrezjka into

1380
01:14:02,409 --> 01:14:05,145
surveillance state,
but we turned it against him.

1381
01:14:05,212 --> 01:14:07,614
We are going to bring down
his regime in disgrace.

1382
01:14:07,681 --> 01:14:09,683
Look, none of this is
making sense to me.

1383
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:11,885
You can explain it
to the FBI when we land.

1384
01:14:11,951 --> 01:14:14,388
No, please, please!

1385
01:14:14,455 --> 01:14:16,056
No, please,
I can't let you take it.

1386
01:14:16,123 --> 01:14:17,624
I have emails,
I have documents,

1387
01:14:17,691 --> 01:14:19,626
I have evidence
against him, okay?

1388
01:14:19,693 --> 01:14:21,061
Before he kills us!

1389
01:14:21,128 --> 01:14:22,763
He will kill us all,
do you understand?

1390
01:14:22,830 --> 01:14:24,565
I've had enough unruly
passengers for one flight.

1391
01:14:24,631 --> 01:14:27,367
-You're taking your seat, sir!
-Please, please!

1392
01:14:31,538 --> 01:14:34,641
<i>Coastal Air,</i>
<i>this is Cobra 1.</i>

1393
01:14:34,708 --> 01:14:38,078
<i>We lost Cobra 2.</i>

1394
01:14:38,145 --> 01:14:41,114
<i>I repeat, Cobra 2</i>
<i>has been shot down.</i>

1395
01:14:41,181 --> 01:14:45,352
<i>Be advised,</i>
<i>begin your descent ASAP.</i>

1396
01:14:45,419 --> 01:14:46,887
<i>These jets are unmanned.</i>

1397
01:14:46,954 --> 01:14:49,156
<i>AI control, Hat Trick.</i>

1398
01:14:49,223 --> 01:14:51,425
<i>I don't know what</i>
<i>they're capable of.</i>

1399
01:14:51,492 --> 01:14:53,293
I thought that AI was lost?

1400
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:55,295
<i>Well, they found it.</i>

1401
01:14:55,362 --> 01:14:57,598
Coastal, there are more
of them coming.

1402
01:14:57,664 --> 01:15:01,602
Two more MiGs.
I repeat, begin your descent.

1403
01:15:10,911 --> 01:15:12,546
Coastal, you're under attack.

1404
01:15:12,613 --> 01:15:14,515
-Incoming MiG!
-We see it.

1405
01:15:14,581 --> 01:15:16,283
Give me the flight deck,
Captain.

1406
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:18,018
I can outmaneuver these guys.

1407
01:15:18,085 --> 01:15:19,753
It's all yours, Lieutenant.

1408
01:15:28,262 --> 01:15:30,864
Coastal, the MiG
is coming right for you

1409
01:15:30,931 --> 01:15:32,566
at heading 0-9-0!

1410
01:15:33,834 --> 01:15:36,603
Cobra 1, seeing bandit.

1411
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:38,705
MiG-29...

1412
01:15:38,772 --> 01:15:41,408
0-5-0.

1413
01:15:41,475 --> 01:15:43,443
50.

1414
01:15:43,510 --> 01:15:45,379
Angels 10.

1415
01:15:45,445 --> 01:15:48,949
Coastal, here comes MiG 1.

1416
01:15:49,017 --> 01:15:51,051
I'm on him, go evasive.

1417
01:16:00,894 --> 01:16:05,165
Cobra 1, enemy MiG attempting
collision with our aircraft.

1418
01:16:08,769 --> 01:16:12,839
Vanessa, tell the captain
to open the hatch.

1419
01:16:12,906 --> 01:16:15,475
Captain, disarm the baggage
compartment door.

1420
01:16:17,110 --> 01:16:18,612
You're good to go.

1421
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:24,785
Fox 1.

1422
01:16:26,553 --> 01:16:27,688
Fox 2.

1423
01:16:29,323 --> 01:16:31,358
Splash one MiG.

1424
01:16:36,897 --> 01:16:38,465
Do you see he's circling?

1425
01:16:40,267 --> 01:16:42,536
MiG 2 circling back.

1426
01:16:44,438 --> 01:16:46,573
On collision heading...

1427
01:16:49,010 --> 01:16:51,545
Aaah!

1428
01:16:53,014 --> 01:16:55,182
Sayonara, you son of a bitch.

1429
01:16:56,717 --> 01:16:58,352
[explosion]

1430
01:17:05,325 --> 01:17:08,128
[all screaming]

1431
01:17:12,866 --> 01:17:15,402
Oh, God, oh, God!

1432
01:17:15,469 --> 01:17:18,271
[screaming continues]

1433
01:17:30,951 --> 01:17:32,319
We have to land the plane.

1434
01:17:32,386 --> 01:17:33,820
I don't know how to fly a plane!

1435
01:17:33,887 --> 01:17:35,622
Look, I don't either.
We don't have a choice,

1436
01:17:35,689 --> 01:17:37,491
unless you wanna get on the PA
and find out if we got

1437
01:17:37,557 --> 01:17:39,826
any pilots onboard as we go
screaming into the Atlantic.

1438
01:17:39,893 --> 01:17:40,994
Come on!

1439
01:17:41,062 --> 01:17:42,162
Coastal, do you copy?

1440
01:17:42,229 --> 01:17:43,497
This is Ground, come in.

1441
01:17:43,563 --> 01:17:44,965
Coastal, do you copy?

1442
01:17:45,033 --> 01:17:46,833
Nothing, I'm getting
nothing from the plane.

1443
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:49,703
What? You can't hail 2191
on the radio?

1444
01:17:49,770 --> 01:17:50,937
No.

1445
01:17:52,172 --> 01:17:54,207
Coastal 2191, do you copy?

1446
01:17:54,274 --> 01:17:56,176
Are you there?
Do you read me?

1447
01:17:56,243 --> 01:17:58,245
Are you there?

1448
01:17:58,311 --> 01:17:59,813
[muttering indistinctly]

1449
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:01,348
The pilots are dead!

1450
01:18:01,415 --> 01:18:02,983
It's them,
they're on the way in!

1451
01:18:03,051 --> 01:18:04,518
-Take the phone.
-Hello?

1452
01:18:04,584 --> 01:18:06,286
We're bringing it in
for a landing.

1453
01:18:06,353 --> 01:18:08,288
We're landing.

1454
01:18:08,355 --> 01:18:10,290
What? You're what?

1455
01:18:10,357 --> 01:18:12,859
Okay, okay, listen closely,
I'll steer you in.

1456
01:18:12,926 --> 01:18:15,063
You're gonna be
coming in on runway 13R--

1457
01:18:15,129 --> 01:18:17,898
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I don't know
what any of that means.

1458
01:18:17,964 --> 01:18:19,433
Okay, okay, okay.

1459
01:18:19,499 --> 01:18:21,635
Pay close attention
and do not deviate.

1460
01:18:21,702 --> 01:18:24,738
You're going to be coming in
slowly on runway 13R.

1461
01:18:27,474 --> 01:18:28,875
Give me that,
I'll bring them in.

1462
01:18:28,942 --> 01:18:30,744
This is Janis,
your ATC supervisor

1463
01:18:30,811 --> 01:18:32,713
Listen very carefully
to every word.

1464
01:18:32,779 --> 01:18:34,381
<i>Now, the system switched</i>
<i>to autopilot because</i>

1465
01:18:34,448 --> 01:18:35,982
<i>of all the rain</i>
<i>from the runway</i>

1466
01:18:36,050 --> 01:18:37,051
<i>and I'm gonna need</i>
<i>your help steering her in.</i>

1467
01:18:37,118 --> 01:18:38,952
I got you, ATC.

1468
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:40,887
My headset isn't working.

1469
01:18:43,724 --> 01:18:45,959
Now the water from the rain
is not going to make it easy,

1470
01:18:46,027 --> 01:18:48,328
so I don't know how much
autopilot is going to work.

1471
01:18:48,395 --> 01:18:50,697
Listen very carefully,
I'm gonna need your help

1472
01:18:50,764 --> 01:18:52,200
to steer her in.

1473
01:18:52,265 --> 01:18:54,035
Where's the landing gear?

1474
01:18:54,102 --> 01:18:55,969
I can't find the switch!

1475
01:18:56,037 --> 01:18:57,904
I think the comms are down!

1476
01:19:01,975 --> 01:19:04,745
All right, we're going in
without wheels.

1477
01:19:09,716 --> 01:19:11,052
BANSHEE: <i>The switch</i>
<i>for the landing gear</i>

1478
01:19:11,119 --> 01:19:12,419
<i>is directly above your head!</i>

1479
01:19:12,486 --> 01:19:15,089
<i>I repeat, directly</i>
<i>above your head!</i>

1480
01:19:15,156 --> 01:19:16,623
Who is that?

1481
01:19:16,690 --> 01:19:18,358
I got the comm to work.

1482
01:19:18,425 --> 01:19:21,294
Coastal,
flip that switch now!

1483
01:19:25,632 --> 01:19:27,334
All right, listen carefully.

1484
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:28,902
Increase speed.

1485
01:19:29,936 --> 01:19:31,972
Reach for that throttle
by your side.

1486
01:19:35,308 --> 01:19:37,577
They're coming in too fast.

1487
01:19:37,644 --> 01:19:39,346
-Are you looking at the screen?
-Reach for that throttle,

1488
01:19:39,412 --> 01:19:40,781
increase the speed.

1489
01:19:40,847 --> 01:19:43,650
Now thrust it forward
and bring the nose down.

1490
01:19:44,618 --> 01:19:45,819
-[alarm blaring]
-Okay, uh, yeah,

1491
01:19:45,886 --> 01:19:47,888
we're getting some
kind of a sound,

1492
01:19:47,954 --> 01:19:50,757
a very bad sound,
some kind of alarm going.

1493
01:19:52,526 --> 01:19:54,494
You're doing it on purpose.

1494
01:19:54,561 --> 01:19:55,862
You're gonna crash the plane!

1495
01:19:55,929 --> 01:19:58,199
What did you s--
Give me that phone!

1496
01:19:58,266 --> 01:20:00,168
[all shouting]

1497
01:20:00,234 --> 01:20:02,136
You're under arrest.

1498
01:20:02,203 --> 01:20:03,870
No! Let it crash!

1499
01:20:03,937 --> 01:20:06,007
Let 'em all crash!

1500
01:20:09,076 --> 01:20:10,544
Oh, my God!

1501
01:20:19,319 --> 01:20:20,487
I'm not ready for this.

1502
01:20:20,554 --> 01:20:22,789
[screaming]

1503
01:20:25,126 --> 01:20:26,393
Okay, we can do this

1504
01:20:26,459 --> 01:20:28,461
We're gonna land this plane!

1505
01:20:57,524 --> 01:20:59,893
[exhales, laughs]

1506
01:21:12,405 --> 01:21:14,208
[laughing]

1507
01:21:14,275 --> 01:21:16,344
We did it.

1508
01:21:16,409 --> 01:21:19,247
We did it,
we landed the plane.

1509
01:21:19,313 --> 01:21:21,414
[laughing]

1510
01:21:21,481 --> 01:21:23,583
Oh my-- Holy...

1511
01:21:23,650 --> 01:21:25,119
We did it, we did it.

1512
01:21:25,186 --> 01:21:27,888
It's okay, it's okay.

1513
01:21:44,404 --> 01:21:46,140
This is yours.

1514
01:21:48,408 --> 01:21:49,976
Thank you.

1515
01:21:50,044 --> 01:21:52,712
I've just been debriefed
by Mr. Gurin here.

1516
01:21:52,779 --> 01:21:54,915
He's told me why
the aircraft was targeted.

1517
01:21:54,981 --> 01:21:57,617
We're going to place him under
federal protected custody

1518
01:21:57,684 --> 01:21:59,452
so that way he can meet
with the State Department.

1519
01:21:59,519 --> 01:22:05,059
Artosk labeled our group
as enemy of state.

1520
01:22:05,126 --> 01:22:08,362
They got the Pavdekshem
to bomb the plane.

1521
01:22:08,428 --> 01:22:10,231
For what?

1522
01:22:10,298 --> 01:22:12,099
Plausible deniability?

1523
01:22:12,166 --> 01:22:14,601
Yes, of course.

1524
01:22:14,668 --> 01:22:17,537
Blame us for the crime
in front of the whole world

1525
01:22:17,604 --> 01:22:20,241
and then tell Pavdekshem
they are free from exile

1526
01:22:20,308 --> 01:22:25,445
if they do dirty work,
like bomb airline carrier.

1527
01:22:25,512 --> 01:22:27,514
But when it didn't work

1528
01:22:27,580 --> 01:22:29,950
he got his military drones
to attack.

1529
01:22:31,818 --> 01:22:33,421
You're all free to go.

1530
01:22:33,486 --> 01:22:36,223
We're gonna put him on a flight
to DC within the hour.

1531
01:22:37,824 --> 01:22:40,161
Maybe put him
on a train this time.

1532
01:22:40,227 --> 01:22:42,096
[all chuckling]

1533
01:22:52,672 --> 01:22:54,507
I feel like I wanna barf.

1534
01:22:56,277 --> 01:22:59,846
So, what are your plans
for the night?

1535
01:22:59,913 --> 01:23:01,415
[laughing]

1536
01:23:01,481 --> 01:23:02,749
Why?

1537
01:23:02,816 --> 01:23:05,086
What do you have in mind?

1538
01:23:05,152 --> 01:23:08,022
Want to go to a wedding?

1539
01:23:08,089 --> 01:23:10,657
Are you kidding me?
Go on another flight?

1540
01:23:12,592 --> 01:23:14,594
Hey there.

1541
01:23:14,661 --> 01:23:16,763
You two need a lift?

1542
01:23:16,830 --> 01:23:19,499
I don't think we'll fly
this one.

1543
01:23:21,534 --> 01:23:24,238
So what do you think?

1544
01:23:24,305 --> 01:23:26,107
Sure, why not?

1545
01:23:26,173 --> 01:23:29,609
There's some good flying
you guys did up there.

1546
01:23:29,676 --> 01:23:31,678
Well, we had some help.

1547
01:23:31,745 --> 01:23:34,048
We're natural born pilots,
I guess.

1548
01:23:34,115 --> 01:23:35,582
That's what we do.

1549
01:23:35,648 --> 01:23:37,917
