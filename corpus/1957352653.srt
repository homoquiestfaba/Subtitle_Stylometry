1
00:01:26,067 --> 00:01:27,827
Thank you.

2
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,545
- Martin.
- Hm?

3
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:46,092
- I'm gonna die.
- No, ya aren't.

4
00:02:46,573 --> 00:02:48,810
Yes, I am.

5
00:02:58,658 --> 00:03:00,734
What's wrong with me doctor?

6
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:04,583
Well, I can't give you a
definite answer Mrs. Hightower,

7
00:03:04,633 --> 00:03:08,068
in medicine we're
never 100% sure.

8
00:03:08,734 --> 00:03:12,336
Now, when the pain gets too
bad take one of these.

9
00:03:12,395 --> 00:03:17,205
But, try not to take
more than two in any given day.

10
00:03:20,965 --> 00:03:22,573
I'm gonna die, ain't I.

11
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,362
Well, we're all going
to die, Mrs. Hightower.

12
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,440
Look, perhaps I should have
a chat with your husband.

13
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:36,491
Doctor, I got three more like this at home.

14
00:03:36,864 --> 00:03:40,096
I gotta know,
I gotta make plans.

15
00:03:57,295 --> 00:03:58,488
Seen him.

16
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:01,105
Well?

17
00:04:01,465 --> 00:04:04,625
- He says I'm right about dying.
-<i> He's cracked.

18
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,713
He ain't cracked, he's got a
paper with ribbons on the wall.

19
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:10,588
What about that doctor
told the Henleys their...

20
00:04:10,682 --> 00:04:16,682
little Jimmy had the ague,<i> turned out
to be the diphtheria? Doctors... all cracked.

21
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:20,013
- He's an Army doctor, he knows.
- He's cracked.

22
00:04:20,363 --> 00:04:23,307
- I got this thing growing inside of me.
- I don't want to hear about it!

23
00:04:23,757 --> 00:04:24,441
Ya gotta to hear about it.

24
00:04:24,548 --> 00:04:26,808
- No.
- Yep.

25
00:04:27,651 --> 00:04:29,870
It's in me, and it just
keeps gettin' bigger

26
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,301
till there's no room for
the other stuff to do what

27
00:04:32,321 --> 00:04:37,581
it has to do, and in time,
my body's just gonna stop.

28
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:45,103
- How much time?
- Two months, maybe a little more.

29
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,563
We gotta make plans, Martin.

30
00:05:00,522 --> 00:05:02,032
No.

31
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:05,884
No plans.

32
00:05:08,967 --> 00:05:13,510
Whatever happens, it happens, but I
don't want to think about it.

33
00:05:15,944 --> 00:05:19,017
And I don't want to talk about it.

34
00:05:34,015 --> 00:05:36,763
You better get yourself into bed today.
Give me that.

35
00:05:36,813 --> 00:05:40,773
I was gonna make soap and
vinegar and vanilla pudding...

36
00:05:40,823 --> 00:05:42,791
I... I'll do all of it,
you just tell me how, come on.

37
00:05:42,841 --> 00:05:46,438
Well, what about the pharmacy?
Well, I'll do it myself...

38
00:06:21,177 --> 00:06:26,290
Oh! Oh! Oh!

39
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,864
- What are ya doing?
- Just tidyin' up a bit?

40
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,644
I'm really... I'm feeling much better.

41
00:06:46,994 --> 00:06:49,911
Martin, what are ya gonna
do when I'm gone?

42
00:06:49,961 --> 00:06:51,574
We gotta talk, I gotta know.

43
00:06:51,624 --> 00:06:52,598
I'll get by.

44
00:06:53,592 --> 00:06:57,032
How? You can't manage a<i> farm and
four young children yourself.

45
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,261
There went the today.

46
00:07:04,105 --> 00:07:05,203
Come here.

47
00:07:05,453 --> 00:07:10,293
If it's God's will, and you go,
then I'll just worry about it then.

48
00:07:11,156 --> 00:07:13,274
Be too late then,
we gotta start worrying now.

49
00:07:13,324 --> 00:07:14,527
What are ya going to do
with the children?

50
00:07:14,577 --> 00:07:17,146
<i>Ya can't tend to 'em, what
are ya going to do?

51
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,762
I don't know.

52
00:07:21,012 --> 00:07:24,679
Jessica is old enough to tend
to <i>herself, maybe Nathan.

53
00:07:25,405 --> 00:07:27,527
Maybe they could stay with
me and we send Margaret

54
00:07:27,577 --> 00:07:30,598
and Jack off to Emma's <i>in
Cleveland, at least for few years.

55
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,870
Your sister's got six of
her own and poor as rat.

56
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,026
Well, maybe she could
just manage Margaret

57
00:07:36,076 --> 00:07:37,700
and we'll take Jack
and we'll send him to

58
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,547
your brother Daniel in
Baltimore. I don't know.

59
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,064
You expect me
to die knowin' my

60
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:44,778
family's scattered all
across the continent.

61
00:07:47,404 --> 00:07:49,369
You can't separate my babies.

62
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:52,378
I'll come back and
haunt you, I swear it.

63
00:07:53,303 --> 00:07:55,622
Maybe I'll be just sell the
durn farm and I'll go back

64
00:07:55,728 --> 00:07:58,754
to Bucks County open up a
harness shop with my father.

65
00:07:58,804 --> 00:08:02,513
I'll have the kids with me all
day long and have kin to help me.

66
00:08:03,675 --> 00:08:05,092
Martin Hightower...

67
00:08:05,866 --> 00:08:09,034
we came across 2000 miles of
purgatory to claim this land.

68
00:08:09,084 --> 00:08:11,609
We've been working 18 hours a
day to make somethin' of it.

69
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:14,467
Ain't worth buffalo
cookies now but someday...

70
00:08:14,957 --> 00:08:17,706
This farm is their inheritance...

71
00:08:17,838 --> 00:08:20,123
don't you dare sell it.

72
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:23,336
Don't you dare.

73
00:08:32,592 --> 00:08:35,459
Well, what do ya want me to do?

74
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:38,242
Start worrying about it.

75
00:08:42,828 --> 00:08:45,284
Don't you think I hadn't been?

76
00:08:56,752 --> 00:09:01,272
Martin? I know we gotta do, we
gotta find you another wife.

77
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,781
I don't want no other wife.

78
00:09:03,831 --> 00:09:06,013
Yeah, but after I'm dead,
you're gonna need another wife.

79
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,618
It's the only way, now put that down
and think, who we're going to get?

80
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,236
Now looky here, Mrs. Hightower,
if there ever comes a time where you are...

81
00:09:12,321 --> 00:09:14,266
what you said, maybe I'll
put my mind to it then,

82
00:09:14,316 --> 00:09:16,615
but if you'll excuse me,
I don't intend holding a discussion

83
00:09:16,665 --> 00:09:19,810
with my first wife about
the selection of my second.

84
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,938
It can't wait till after,

85
00:09:22,388 --> 00:09:25,741
it'll be too late, everything will fall
apart around here, we got to start now.

86
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:28,825
We got to have someone ready to step
in my shoes the minute I'm gone.

87
00:09:28,907 --> 00:09:32,503
Now you just stop this,
Amy, this here conversation's ungodly.

88
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,178
God? Are you saying
God don't want you and

89
00:09:36,228 --> 00:09:38,473
the children have a life
together on this farm.

90
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,486
God wants to disperse this family,
is that what you're saying?

91
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,916
I don't know what the heck I'm saying.

92
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:48,922
But there are 10 men for every one woman
on these plains from Texas to Dakota.

93
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:50,756
Now where are you going to find one,

94
00:09:50,815 --> 00:09:54,802
wants to tend a farm and four
kids what aren't even our own?

95
00:09:56,831 --> 00:09:59,160
All the more reason
to start looking now.

96
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,028
- Mr. Van Der Meer?
- Yes.

97
00:10:25,122 --> 00:10:29,369
I'm Amy Hightower from across the creek,
I was wondering if I could have a talk.

98
00:10:30,108 --> 00:10:32,448
Come in, sit, my wife Merka.

99
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:35,362
Pleased to meet you,
I'll get some coffee.

100
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,668
No trouble, please.

101
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:44,156
I have a sickness,
gonna die reasonable soon.

102
00:10:44,664 --> 00:10:46,349
Ain't the fever.

103
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,037
Well, that's too bad,
I'm sorry to hear that.

104
00:10:49,387 --> 00:10:51,979
My husband and I have four
children, eldest seven.

105
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:54,404
After I go he's going to
need a wife real quick.

106
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:57,710
I hear ya have a daughter, Caroline.

107
00:10:59,443 --> 00:11:00,732
I assume that's her.

108
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,073
<i>Oh, no, that's Hester,
she's just big,</i>

109
00:11:03,151 --> 00:11:05,981
she's only 11. That's Caroline.

110
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:11,165
Well, anyway, I was
wondering if you'd let my

111
00:11:11,215 --> 00:11:13,750
husband take her to wife
when the time comes.

112
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,469
Oh... I see.

113
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:24,003
We're homesteaders, got
a fine piece of land,

114
00:11:24,053 --> 00:11:26,058
20 acres corn planted this year.

115
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:32,156
We got six cows, ox,
<i>pigs and hens, got a nice size soddy.

116
00:11:32,206 --> 00:11:35,037
<i>And an oak</i> sideboard we
brought from Maryland.

117
00:11:35,087 --> 00:11:37,797
We got a cotton
mattress, a goose feather quilt

118
00:11:37,847 --> 00:11:40,497
and a Calico store
bought frock she'd have.

119
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,774
<i>Might just need some takin' in.

120
00:11:43,568 --> 00:11:47,985
Martin's a real gentle, wholesome man.

121
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,977
He'd make her a fine husband.

122
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,847
Miss Hightower,
you seem like a fine woman

123
00:11:56,897 --> 00:11:59,344
and I wish I could help
you out with your situation,

124
00:11:59,394 --> 00:12:00,981
but they...
they're already five offers

125
00:12:01,031 --> 00:12:03,750
of <i>matrimony on line
for Caroline ahead of you.

126
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,503
<i>The mill owner over there at
Bellevue, he offered my $600 for her,

127
00:12:07,553 --> 00:12:10,060
he's an old man,
but he's a good Christian.

128
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,124
And that smith over there,
he's got a handsome young

129
00:12:12,137 --> 00:12:15,834
son that's gonna inherit that
whole business<i> one day soon.

130
00:12:18,844 --> 00:12:22,353
Mrs. Hightower, I know the kind
of life a soddy woman lives.

131
00:12:22,954 --> 00:12:26,708
I just want something
better for my Caroline.

132
00:12:27,354 --> 00:12:28,982
I'm sorry.

133
00:12:29,432 --> 00:12:31,520
<i>Yea, though I walk through the Valley of

134
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,420
<i>the Shadow of Death, I will fear no evil.

135
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:39,733
<i>Thy rod and thy staff comfort me. I will
dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

136
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:46,254
He was a good farmer, a good husband,
a good father, a good man.

137
00:12:46,504 --> 00:12:49,277
<i>We know you'll take him gentle
into to your bosom Lord,

138
00:12:49,327 --> 00:12:54,789
and we pray you'll send comfort and
grace to <i>those he left behind.

139
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,159
<i>Dust thou art and under
dust thou shall return.

140
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,246
Excuse me. I ask your forgiveness
for intruding on your grief.

141
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:19,269
But I happen to be riddin'
passed and witnessed the proceedings.

142
00:13:19,742 --> 00:13:23,971
I just had the feeling it
was fate brought me here.

143
00:13:25,231 --> 00:13:30,752
Please, can I talk to
you for a moment, please?

144
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,046
All right.

145
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,872
- I see you've just been widowed.
- Yeah.

146
00:13:40,922 --> 00:13:43,820
You're going to need a
father for your children.

147
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,904
And it just so happens in a short time,

148
00:13:45,954 --> 00:13:50,073
my husband's going to be a widower in
need of a mother for our children.

149
00:13:50,487 --> 00:13:51,924
So I'd like to ask
you on his behalf

150
00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:54,393
if you consider
marrying up with him.

151
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,605
I understand and I appreciate it,

152
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:05,781
unfortunately, it comes a little late...
I'm already spoken for.

153
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,232
Oh... well...

154
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,955
I wish you both the best.

155
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,292
Whoa!

156
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,929
Excuse me, I was looking
for the widow Donohue.

157
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,805
You found her.

158
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:49,570
Oh, I'm sorry. I must have been
laboring under some misunderstanding.

159
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:52,212
<i>Sorry for disturbing you.

160
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:56,624
Good day.

161
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:06,217
Hey! You looking for the widow Hattie
Donahue or the widow Isabel Donahue?

162
00:15:17,935 --> 00:15:20,494
- They're coming, Ma.
- Nathan.

163
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:25,270
Alrighty. Now, you good now, and don't
you speak lest you're asked something.

164
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,688
Martin!

165
00:15:39,597 --> 00:15:43,315
<i>Please, come in.

166
00:15:45,067 --> 00:15:48,816
This is Miss Hattie Donahue
and Miss Isabel Donahue.

167
00:15:49,243 --> 00:15:52,160
<i>This is my husband Martin Hightower.

168
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,717
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

169
00:15:54,967 --> 00:15:58,295
And these are our children,
<i>Jessica, Nathan, and Jack...

170
00:15:58,345 --> 00:16:01,469
and baby Margaret over
there in the crib.

171
00:16:02,786 --> 00:16:05,595
The Lord never saw fit
to make me a mother.

172
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:09,834
But they all seem... <i>healthy.

173
00:16:10,744 --> 00:16:14,603
<i>They are,</i> and
good natured, all of 'em.

174
00:16:21,983 --> 00:16:25,032
Well, shall we sit down?

175
00:16:37,034 --> 00:16:38,537
Ladies...

176
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:44,234
My wife has made a chokeberry pie and I
hope you'll stay and refresh yourselves.

177
00:16:44,974 --> 00:16:48,326
But Miss Donahue, I aren't gonna marry
you and that's the finish of it.

178
00:16:48,706 --> 00:16:50,463
<i>I thank you for the visit.

179
00:16:50,513 --> 00:16:54,403
Now, if you'll excuse me,
one of my hogs is ailin'.

180
00:17:13,943 --> 00:17:17,896
I'm sorry, Amy, I just couldn't
take that woman t'wife.

181
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:25,023
But we agreed,
ya have to get married again.

182
00:17:25,673 --> 00:17:27,321
I know, but not her.

183
00:17:28,144 --> 00:17:32,285
Why in damnation not, she's a
strong, moral, healthy woman.

184
00:17:33,101 --> 00:17:36,507
- She don't give me the tingles.
- What?

185
00:17:39,557 --> 00:17:42,342
She don't give me tingles.

186
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:46,144
<i>A man oughtn't have to bed a
woman don't give him the tingles.

187
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,154
Then don't bed 'er.

188
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:51,305
Ya don't have to if you don't want to,
ya could still marry her.

189
00:17:51,355 --> 00:17:55,722
It's a man's duty to bed his wife,
a man don't bed his wife is not a man.

190
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,574
There ain't nobody else,
I've looked for miles around.

191
00:18:01,624 --> 00:18:05,467
Well, we'll just look...
further afield then.

192
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:09,845
Criminy!

193
00:18:20,904 --> 00:18:23,627
Do I give you the tingles.

194
00:18:24,706 --> 00:18:27,505
Every time I look at ya.

195
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,854
Every blessin' time.

196
00:19:57,662 --> 00:20:01,804
Excuse me, do you have any single
women livin' in these parts?

197
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:06,301
Do you know of any single
women livin' in these parts?

198
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,587
Naw, not in this town.

199
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,879
- What can I get ya?
- A lemonade?

200
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:31,529
Sarsaparilla?

201
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,995
- Sarsaparilla, take a seat.
- Thank you.

202
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:46,172
You alright?

203
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:53,176
I was so sure in a town this size
there'd be some marriageable women.

204
00:20:53,411 --> 00:20:55,946
I have to locate one
and there ain't any.

205
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:59,949
That's true, soon as one shows
up or a young'n grows up,

206
00:20:59,999 --> 00:21:02,512
men swarm around like flies.

207
00:21:02,607 --> 00:21:05,797
I bet there ain't an unwed
female between 14 and 114...

208
00:21:05,856 --> 00:21:08,588
aside from the
ladies on the line.

209
00:21:09,202 --> 00:21:11,697
Ladies on the line,
who are they?

210
00:21:12,017 --> 00:21:14,097
Well, you know...

211
00:21:14,794 --> 00:21:17,018
they live in cribs down
by the edge of town.

212
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:21,285
- And they're unattached?
- So to speak.

213
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,683
They're working women,
if you get my drift.

214
00:21:26,555 --> 00:21:28,595
Working at what?

215
00:21:30,116 --> 00:21:31,570
Oh.

216
00:21:32,568 --> 00:21:34,748
Oh...

217
00:21:35,053 --> 00:21:36,805
Thank you.

218
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:57,550
What do you want?

219
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,454
I was wonderin' if I could
talk to you a moment.

220
00:21:59,533 --> 00:22:02,908
I'm busy!
Can't you see the door is closed!

221
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:06,782
Sorry, Pat darlin',
now where was I?

222
00:22:12,239 --> 00:22:15,573
Oh!
Oh, I... I'm sorry.

223
00:22:43,623 --> 00:22:46,806
- Yeah!
- Could I have a moment of your time.

224
00:22:47,016 --> 00:22:48,402
My time's valuable.

225
00:22:53,543 --> 00:22:55,042
No, come on in.

226
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:04,553
- My name is Amy Hightower, you're Pearl?
- Yeah.

227
00:23:05,162 --> 00:23:07,023
What's your last name?

228
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,935
I don't need one.

229
00:23:11,095 --> 00:23:13,659
Well, how long have you
lived in Cedar Springs?

230
00:23:13,709 --> 00:23:15,821
Well, too long.

231
00:23:17,442 --> 00:23:18,356
Are you married?

232
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:21,639
Yeah, I'm married my work,
what do you want lady?

233
00:23:23,453 --> 00:23:24,265
I want you to
marry up with my

234
00:23:24,304 --> 00:23:26,959
husband and tend to my
children after I die.

235
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:29,730
Which is gonna be soon.

236
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:37,719
All right.

237
00:23:37,869 --> 00:23:40,161
You haven't even asked
me where we're goin',

238
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:42,107
what sort of life it is.

239
00:23:42,157 --> 00:23:44,930
Haven't even asked me
what my husband's like.

240
00:23:45,113 --> 00:23:47,115
Does he kill people in their sleep.

241
00:23:47,394 --> 00:23:50,673
- No.
- Then I reckon I can handle him.

242
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,725
Do you like children?

243
00:23:55,775 --> 00:23:58,766
Some, some not, same as with people.

244
00:23:58,816 --> 00:24:02,292
Well, I gotta warn ya, life is pretty hard and wearing.

245
00:24:02,342 --> 00:24:04,871
Wait, wait, wait.
You haven't second thoughts, lady?

246
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:08,552
- Well...
- We can just call the whole thing off.

247
00:24:08,831 --> 00:24:11,774
Well, I guess I'm just kind of worried.

248
00:24:11,824 --> 00:24:15,232
I mean, here I am entrusting you
with my home, my man, my children.

249
00:24:15,682 --> 00:24:17,919
I don't know nothin'
about you except...

250
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,708
Except I'm a whore?

251
00:24:22,857 --> 00:24:25,521
Well, let me tell you a
little bit about myself.

252
00:24:25,671 --> 00:24:27,166
Goodbye!

253
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:32,371
I ain't just a whore, I'm a
good whore, a damned good whore.

254
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:35,115
<i>The house I worked at
New Orleans, </i> men made

255
00:24:35,165 --> 00:24:38,396
reservations for my time,
days in advance.

256
00:24:39,097 --> 00:24:44,492
In California, them miners, they paid
up to $500 for half an hour of my time.

257
00:24:45,044 --> 00:24:47,415
Of course a cup of coffee
was eighty dollars.

258
00:24:47,465 --> 00:24:49,412
But anyway...
in there, <i>that rat trap,

259
00:24:49,462 --> 00:24:51,647
<i>I got by,
</i>surrounded by girls half my age.

260
00:24:51,697 --> 00:24:55,704
Ya know that ain't easy,
but I'm good... good.

261
00:24:55,754 --> 00:24:58,547
A good whore, just like I'll be
a good mother and a good wife.

262
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,772
So am I going with you or not?

263
00:25:00,922 --> 00:25:03,499
'Cause I'm going somewhere, I'm packed.

264
00:25:08,272 --> 00:25:10,740
Is California pretty?

265
00:25:35,391 --> 00:25:37,117
Hi, Ma!

266
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:40,479
Whoa!

267
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,595
Were you a good boy?

268
00:25:47,258 --> 00:25:50,778
Are you here for daddy?

269
00:25:54,993 --> 00:25:57,716
- Daddy, Ma, and she... a lady's here.
- Sh, sh, Nathan.

270
00:25:57,766 --> 00:26:00,774
- But Daddy...
- Now, Jessica... sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

271
00:26:03,201 --> 00:26:06,280
- You need to be goin' outside now.
- C'mon.

272
00:26:07,792 --> 00:26:14,051
There was an old mule her name was A-Fool.

273
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:17,971
We've been singin'.

274
00:26:18,637 --> 00:26:24,049
She'd been crying all day but now we've
been having some fun, we've been singin'.

275
00:26:24,578 --> 00:26:28,399
- Haven't we? There ya go.
- Come here you.

276
00:26:32,981 --> 00:26:37,967
Pearl, this is my husband Martin Hightower.

277
00:26:39,769 --> 00:26:42,489
Martin, Pearl.

278
00:26:51,767 --> 00:26:54,117
He do for you?

279
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,836
He'll do.

280
00:26:58,576 --> 00:27:00,996
She do for you?

281
00:27:08,996 --> 00:27:12,525
I want ya to know none
of those weren't my idea.

282
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:15,077
<i>None of it, no fashion.

283
00:27:15,227 --> 00:27:18,585
<i>But my wife had</i> arguments and
I didn't have answers for them.

284
00:27:19,635 --> 00:27:21,768
She do for you or not?

285
00:27:24,667 --> 00:27:27,275
She'll do.

286
00:27:38,137 --> 00:27:40,114
Ain't ya gonna tell him?

287
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:45,739
I'm debatin' the necessity of it.

288
00:28:12,354 --> 00:28:15,238
- She's a whore.
- What?

289
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:18,795
She's a whore.

290
00:28:20,487 --> 00:28:22,231
She's a what?

291
00:28:23,708 --> 00:28:26,955
- She's a whore.
- A whore?

292
00:28:29,779 --> 00:28:31,832
Ya didn't tell me that.

293
00:28:33,941 --> 00:28:38,198
- I'm tellin' ya now.
- Well, what did you bring a whore for?

294
00:28:39,546 --> 00:28:40,854
It's all they had?

295
00:28:40,967 --> 00:28:45,326
I searched from one end of that
town to the other, it's all they had.

296
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:56,804
I never agreed to marry no whore.

297
00:28:59,806 --> 00:29:03,307
Would you rather marry the Widow
Donohue, 'cause I'll go get her?

298
00:29:03,457 --> 00:29:05,898
<i>Just make up your mind,</i>
the whore or the Widow Donahue,

299
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:09,816
one or the other,
it's your only choice.

300
00:29:11,232 --> 00:29:13,157
The whore.

301
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:17,753
Martin!

302
00:29:19,394 --> 00:29:21,140
Martin, come here.

303
00:29:24,058 --> 00:29:25,544
Look.

304
00:29:29,539 --> 00:29:31,926
Look, look, and look.

305
00:29:32,757 --> 00:29:35,852
I'm runnin' out of time,
Martin, I can feel it.

306
00:29:38,626 --> 00:29:41,275
I'll take the whore.

307
00:30:18,614 --> 00:30:22,260
Well, how's she gonna get backed to...
Cedar Springs?

308
00:30:22,658 --> 00:30:25,018
Pearl ain't going back, she's stayin'.

309
00:30:25,268 --> 00:30:27,139
Stayin'?

310
00:30:30,244 --> 00:30:35,152
Pearl ain't never lived on a farm or had no
children to mind, I got a lot to teach her.

311
00:30:35,246 --> 00:30:39,463
Besides, once I get down to dyin'
could take a long time,

312
00:30:39,513 --> 00:30:41,654
gonna need some help around here.

313
00:30:41,804 --> 00:30:44,122
It ain't godly all of
us living together here.

314
00:30:44,778 --> 00:30:48,142
She can stay in the shed.
You can build her bunk?

315
00:30:48,192 --> 00:30:49,650
I'll make her some curtains.

316
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:53,611
No, Amy... her and me and
you <i>and you and her and...

317
00:30:53,661 --> 00:30:55,370
It's the only sensible way.

318
00:30:55,877 --> 00:30:58,631
Sensible, but it ain't godly.

319
00:30:59,971 --> 00:31:02,414
Nice chattin' with you.

320
00:31:07,437 --> 00:31:09,876
<i>So for ear ache,
Nathan gets them all the time,

321
00:31:09,926 --> 00:31:14,237
just mix a little tobacco juice, then
you boil it up, pour it in the ear warm.

322
00:31:14,487 --> 00:31:18,319
And you'll notice I always leave
cobwebs in the corner, stops the bleedin'.

323
00:31:18,569 --> 00:31:21,706
And for croup, I...
Oh!

324
00:31:21,786 --> 00:31:23,329
Excuse me?

325
00:31:24,122 --> 00:31:26,468
Can you get that, that's a good one?

326
00:31:28,615 --> 00:31:29,599
What is this?

327
00:31:29,649 --> 00:31:32,294
Apple droppin's,
makes good fuel.

328
00:31:32,344 --> 00:31:35,980
- You bring 'em in the house?
- Gotta bring 'em in to use 'em.

329
00:31:36,556 --> 00:31:40,422
We store 'em outside, they're all
dried out, hard to smell it all.

330
00:31:40,477 --> 00:31:44,222
Come winter, you'll be
real grateful for 'em.

331
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:49,589
Sure I'll rush right out and kiss
the first buffalo's ass I spy.

332
00:32:08,418 --> 00:32:12,595
Well, Abe Lincoln should forgot
about the slaves and freed you.

333
00:32:13,903 --> 00:32:16,569
Oh! My soup!

334
00:32:33,047 --> 00:32:35,530
- All right.
- I slept on worse.

335
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:37,681
I'll bet.

336
00:32:41,796 --> 00:32:44,433
Sorry, uncalled for.

337
00:32:44,483 --> 00:32:48,336
That's all right, never knew you
could put a whole sentence together.

338
00:33:16,531 --> 00:33:18,038
What's that?

339
00:33:19,793 --> 00:33:22,179
Just stuff someone gave me once.

340
00:33:23,414 --> 00:33:24,805
Can I try?

341
00:33:24,881 --> 00:33:28,407
Maybe sometime when you have a little
more skin showing through that mud.

342
00:33:30,123 --> 00:33:32,185
I know why you're here.

343
00:33:37,201 --> 00:33:39,672
Wish I did, kid.

344
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:46,190
How old do they have to be before
they start changing themselves?

345
00:33:47,461 --> 00:33:49,187
No, I'll do it.

346
00:33:52,386 --> 00:33:56,047
Here! Here! Look, watch this!

347
00:34:03,483 --> 00:34:04,709
You all right, Jack?

348
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:07,259
Nathan put a grasshopper down my pants!

349
00:34:07,326 --> 00:34:10,127
Stop that, Nathan,
tell your brother you're sorry.

350
00:34:11,009 --> 00:34:13,554
And tell that grasshopper you're sorry, too.

351
00:34:15,411 --> 00:34:17,648
Pearl, what are thinkin' about?

352
00:34:19,231 --> 00:34:22,066
About all those nights I
was laying with some...

353
00:34:22,198 --> 00:34:27,267
sweaty... unshaven...
foul breath drunks,

354
00:34:27,397 --> 00:34:29,877
huffing and puffing on top of me.

355
00:34:31,042 --> 00:34:34,047
Never realized how lucky I was.

356
00:34:51,708 --> 00:34:54,601
-<i> Pearl?
- Yeah.

357
00:34:57,096 --> 00:34:59,575
- We're in.
- Hear you.

358
00:34:59,792 --> 00:35:01,564
Just some water.

359
00:35:02,598 --> 00:35:06,006
- Smells good.
- Got it from Europe.

360
00:35:06,056 --> 00:35:08,557
I like to look my best for the pigs.

361
00:35:09,297 --> 00:35:13,450
I was gonna prepare the jerky for the
smokin', thought you might want to see how.

362
00:35:13,786 --> 00:35:15,611
I can hardly wait.

363
00:35:17,934 --> 00:35:21,298
Here, try some.

364
00:35:25,085 --> 00:35:27,465
It's so soft.

365
00:35:32,917 --> 00:35:38,167
I make my own complexion salve from white
wax and sweet oil and rose petals.

366
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:44,706
Ain't the same as store bought.
That's so dear.

367
00:36:14,882 --> 00:36:16,589
Oh!

368
00:36:17,939 --> 00:36:21,590
They're beautiful Black Deer, thank you.

369
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:27,194
There for you, Jack,
aren't they beautiful?

370
00:36:44,063 --> 00:36:50,076
Yes, Black Deer,
I'm sure my friend would like some, too.

371
00:36:58,554 --> 00:37:00,069
- Bye!
- Goodbye!

372
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:02,452
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

373
00:37:06,102 --> 00:37:08,217
I wonder what he thinks about us.

374
00:37:08,567 --> 00:37:10,901
Well, he thinks we're plumb strange.

375
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,286
He's got my vote.

376
00:37:16,017 --> 00:37:18,298
Listen you!
Since you got here you ain't stopped

377
00:37:18,348 --> 00:37:20,547
snipin' at the way we
do and the way we are.

378
00:37:20,597 --> 00:37:22,127
I haven't even started yet.

379
00:37:22,177 --> 00:37:24,871
Oh, what? If you hate it here so much,
why don't you just pack up and leave?

380
00:37:24,921 --> 00:37:26,682
Because what the hell are
you gonna do if I do?

381
00:37:26,732 --> 00:37:28,966
Even if I am stupid enough
to take on this mess?

382
00:37:29,016 --> 00:37:30,659
Oh, well, don't you worry about me,

383
00:37:30,709 --> 00:37:35,661
I'm sure that's there's another old
whore right out pack it in somewhere.

384
00:37:36,172 --> 00:37:40,463
Oh, god, I'm sorry, Pearl,
don't leave, please.

385
00:37:43,722 --> 00:37:49,809
I ain't leavin', don't worry, deal's a deal.

386
00:37:53,964 --> 00:37:56,570
When I was 12 my daddy
sent me to a whorehouse,

387
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,721
I didn't have a lot of choice in the matter.

388
00:37:59,576 --> 00:38:04,587
But there was times down the road,
I had some put by, I coulda got out.

389
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:07,995
I know where this is done me.

390
00:38:08,054 --> 00:38:12,639
And I was young and pretty,
I could have found a man, raise kids.

391
00:38:13,962 --> 00:38:17,413
I had a choice.
I made it, now I gotta live with it.

392
00:38:19,383 --> 00:38:23,258
Hey, if I can manage to
hate what you got here,

393
00:38:23,308 --> 00:38:27,014
just a little bit,
makes that easier to do.

394
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:37,756
<i>I try to get in an hour during the
day</i> and then an hour after supper.

395
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:42,221
This here's a good primer to start them
out on and then this one's for history.

396
00:38:42,271 --> 00:38:46,336
And here's the book of English
poems by some English fellas

397
00:38:46,386 --> 00:38:49,073
and it's might hard but
like some of the words.

398
00:38:51,133 --> 00:38:52,246
Pearl...

399
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,708
Listen,
I never had much need for reading,

400
00:38:55,786 --> 00:38:57,726
so I'm not going to be able to help 'em.

401
00:38:57,896 --> 00:39:01,255
- Can't your husband teach 'em?
- No.

402
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:05,341
Martin pretends to read the Bible
but he only knows it by heart.

403
00:39:06,462 --> 00:39:09,665
But it... it.. it doesn't matter,
they're building the school house,

404
00:39:09,751 --> 00:39:11,337
hope to hire a teacher by February.

405
00:39:11,587 --> 00:39:14,363
It's only 6 miles,
Jessica and Nathan can attend there.

406
00:39:14,413 --> 00:39:15,522
Good.

407
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:22,023
Look, I... might be able to teach 'em
a few songs, I'm good at that.

408
00:39:22,459 --> 00:39:27,275
Ask me what 35% of something is.
Go on!

409
00:39:27,304 --> 00:39:31,182
Well, what's 35% of 600?
Two hundred and ten.

410
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:33,604
Figure it, go on!

411
00:39:34,115 --> 00:39:38,082
Ask me something else, tougher, real tough.

412
00:39:38,132 --> 00:39:40,052
Four thousand nine
hundred and eighty.

413
00:39:40,102 --> 00:39:43,848
One thousand seven
hundred and forty three.

414
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:48,739
That's a wonder, how did you do that?

415
00:39:48,892 --> 00:39:51,816
The house I worked at
in... in... New Orleans,

416
00:39:52,148 --> 00:39:58,067
the Court Rouge, whatever I
earn took 65%, I took 35%.

417
00:39:58,951 --> 00:40:01,720
So I got real good at the calculatin'.

418
00:40:03,186 --> 00:40:06,175
Pick her up under the arms,
she won't slip or anything.

419
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:11,576
- Right on your shoulder, right there.
- Ain't exactly ugly are they?

420
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,135
No they ain't.

421
00:40:13,185 --> 00:40:16,308
Think maybe you'd like
to have one, still could?

422
00:40:17,053 --> 00:40:20,970
One got started in there once, had to
get it stopped by the local barber.

423
00:40:21,795 --> 00:40:24,550
He did a bit too good of a job.

424
00:40:24,796 --> 00:40:27,549
Ain't no way another baby'll
get started in there.

425
00:40:40,934 --> 00:40:44,142
Pearl made the pie, ain't it good?

426
00:40:44,792 --> 00:40:45,737
Uh-huh.

427
00:40:46,087 --> 00:40:48,965
- Well, tell her it's good.
- I just did.

428
00:40:49,215 --> 00:40:51,525
No ya didn't, ya told me.

429
00:40:51,575 --> 00:40:54,389
She picked the berries, rolled the dough,
did the whole thing by herself.

430
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:58,568
First pie she made her whole life.
Now, you tell her it's good.

431
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:00,163
I already did.

432
00:41:01,201 --> 00:41:03,684
Silver tongued devil ain't he?

433
00:41:22,536 --> 00:41:23,813
You sure?

434
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:27,176
I've been feelin'
real fine these last few days.

435
00:41:27,771 --> 00:41:30,544
If it hurts you, you tell
me straight away, alright?

436
00:41:30,594 --> 00:41:32,174
Okay.

437
00:41:43,397 --> 00:41:45,671
Oh! Ow!

438
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:53,238
It's pressin' inside me, I just can't.

439
00:41:58,043 --> 00:42:01,088
- ..._..._ ..._...
- No, ya don't.

440
00:42:05,185 --> 00:42:08,024
How come we used to do
it near every night?

441
00:42:10,082 --> 00:42:13,736
A man wants it but he don't need it.

442
00:43:10,486 --> 00:43:12,947
- Martin.
- Huh.

443
00:43:14,365 --> 00:43:21,015
If you and Pearl wanna...
have at it... it's fine with me.

444
00:43:22,476 --> 00:43:24,089
<i>Have at what?

445
00:43:26,285 --> 00:43:29,463
Do it, you know?

446
00:43:30,799 --> 00:43:32,302
<i>What?

447
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:37,362
You know...

448
00:43:38,234 --> 00:43:41,976
Holy... what are you...
woman are you out of your mind?

449
00:43:43,588 --> 00:43:46,820
Soon as I die, you're going to
be doing it anyway, why wait?

450
00:43:47,511 --> 00:43:50,130
What kind of man do
you think you married?

451
00:43:51,464 --> 00:43:54,216
You're good man, but you're a man.

452
00:43:54,981 --> 00:43:58,790
You're entitled to the comforts of a woman's
body and I can't give it to ya no more.

453
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:03,676
Well, that's fine, we'll just call her right
in here and you can sit right over there

454
00:44:03,728 --> 00:44:08,360
and you can watch us have at it and give
her instructions on the whole damn thing.

455
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,210
I just wanted ya to know...

456
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:13,158
I just want you to know that if I
hear another word about this,

457
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:16,257
I'll call a whole arrangement off
and send her packin'.

458
00:44:16,707 --> 00:44:18,054
<i>Understand.

459
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,553
I understand.

460
00:44:36,059 --> 00:44:38,734
Consider it of ya to figure it though.

461
00:44:46,618 --> 00:45:04,511
35% of $100 is $35, 35% of $200
is $70, 35% of $300 is $105.

462
00:45:29,149 --> 00:45:32,427
- You get the milk for Jack?
- What?

463
00:45:44,506 --> 00:45:50,012
- Did you get Jack's milk?
- Milk? Uh... yeah.

464
00:45:55,217 --> 00:45:56,806
All right.

465
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,870
- Beautiful day.
- What?

466
00:46:11,851 --> 00:46:14,827
I'm just commenting on the
beautifulness of the day.

467
00:46:15,695 --> 00:46:19,163
- Oh.
- Ya hear that?

468
00:46:21,129 --> 00:46:24,851
It's a jay, that's what it is, a jay.

469
00:46:25,189 --> 00:46:27,334
- Ya don't say?
- Ya like birds?

470
00:46:28,271 --> 00:46:30,387
Nothin' specific against 'em.

471
00:46:30,837 --> 00:46:32,705
Now me,
I... I always loved birds ever

472
00:46:32,746 --> 00:46:36,114
since I was I was...
I was tiny and I did their calls.

473
00:46:36,164 --> 00:46:39,047
I can do all kinds of...
do all kinds of owls.

474
00:46:39,264 --> 00:46:42,979
Ya know, I can...
this here's a screech owl.

475
00:46:47,958 --> 00:46:51,607
This is... this here's a...
a flammulated owl.

476
00:46:56,590 --> 00:47:00,265
This is a... a...
great horned owl.

477
00:47:07,179 --> 00:47:09,281
Real impressive.

478
00:47:18,108 --> 00:47:19,091
Let go of 'em.

479
00:47:19,141 --> 00:47:21,174
Amy says to go ahead and do it.

480
00:47:21,729 --> 00:47:25,368
I don't imagine it's gonna be too easy
doin' birdcalls without your teeth.

481
00:47:26,607 --> 00:47:28,949
Well, you're a... you're whore, aren't ya?

482
00:47:29,184 --> 00:47:34,256
No, I ain't a whore, I was a whore,
but now I'm a fiancé, you got that?

483
00:47:36,371 --> 00:47:39,827
Dad! Dad! It's ma!
She's having a stomach attack.

484
00:47:39,877 --> 00:47:40,446
What?

485
00:47:40,496 --> 00:47:44,129
Ma just plopped down on the
floor, her stomach's hurtin'.

486
00:47:52,005 --> 00:47:54,921
- It's bad, never hit inside someone's house.
- Easy!

487
00:47:54,971 --> 00:47:55,877
Give her some laudanum.

488
00:47:55,927 --> 00:47:57,935
I gave her some laudanum.
- Give her some more.

489
00:47:57,985 --> 00:48:00,854
- It's too soon.
- Just get it!

490
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:02,938
Now!

491
00:48:09,888 --> 00:48:11,967
Good night, Mommie.

492
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:24,150
Look here, honey,
Pearl's brought you something to eat.

493
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:27,878
It's a little hot, but don't ya wanna
try a little bit, just a...

494
00:48:27,983 --> 00:48:29,065
I can't.

495
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:30,383
Well, just try it,<i> one little taste,

496
00:48:30,453 --> 00:48:33,888
<i>don't want to hurt Pearl's</i>
feelin's now, do ya?

497
00:48:38,774 --> 00:48:41,280
- One more.
- I just can't.

498
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:43,400
All right.

499
00:48:44,349 --> 00:48:47,548
Ya want...
ya want Jessy to read to ya or somethin',

500
00:48:47,598 --> 00:48:50,247
Ya know she reads better me now
and Mr. Honaker give us this

501
00:48:50,293 --> 00:48:55,031
Atlantic Monthly it's only a
year old, he let us borrow it.

502
00:48:55,439 --> 00:48:58,467
No, just let me sleep, okay?

503
00:48:59,315 --> 00:49:01,051
All right.

504
00:49:05,682 --> 00:49:07,710
Go to sleep.

505
00:50:18,726 --> 00:50:21,234
I...

506
00:51:49,148 --> 00:51:51,764
No kissing.

507
00:51:53,211 --> 00:51:54,595
Why not?

508
00:51:54,960 --> 00:52:00,575
Kissing's special, anybody
can do this, animals do this.

509
00:52:01,225 --> 00:52:06,940
People's the only creatures that can
kiss... it oughta mean somethin'.

510
00:52:07,954 --> 00:52:14,070
- Very interestin'.
- The rest is all right.

511
00:52:26,062 --> 00:52:29,871
<i>You better go, she'll
wake up,</i> she'll miss you.

512
00:52:30,071 --> 00:52:33,417
Naw, it's all her idea,
it's what she wanted.

513
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:38,356
Sometimes what a woman says she wants
is a long walk from what she really wants.

514
00:52:39,894 --> 00:52:42,352
Well, I think I'm gonna I tell her about it,

515
00:52:42,411 --> 00:52:46,503
I think she's just gonna be real
happy that you and me are getting along.

516
00:52:46,566 --> 00:52:49,004
- Tell her.
- Uh-huh.

517
00:52:49,688 --> 00:52:52,928
- I don't think so.
- Well, I'm gonna.

518
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:59,100
Oh, yeah, and uh... uh...

519
00:52:59,461 --> 00:53:01,542
this here was... uh...

520
00:53:04,777 --> 00:53:06,762
real nice.

521
00:53:07,116 --> 00:53:10,745
- You gonna tell her that, too?
- Of course.

522
00:53:10,856 --> 00:53:14,578
<i>Well, hold on,</i>
I don't think I want to miss this.

523
00:53:22,504 --> 00:53:24,433
Morning.

524
00:53:25,311 --> 00:53:27,525
Mornin'.

525
00:53:30,506 --> 00:53:32,245
Morning.

526
00:53:36,733 --> 00:53:45,162
Amy... uh...
Pearl and I did like you said and uh...

527
00:53:45,212 --> 00:53:50,262
we uh... well, Pearl was
afraid, you wouldn't be glad

528
00:53:50,312 --> 00:53:57,246
and I told Pearl that you'd be
glad and so... well... you're glad.

529
00:53:57,296 --> 00:53:59,258
Aren't ya?

530
00:54:00,217 --> 00:54:01,755
Of course I am.

531
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:03,643
Why don't you go start the stove.

532
00:54:03,693 --> 00:54:04,974
Oh, Jessica's done doin' that.

533
00:54:05,006 --> 00:54:09,908
- No, I wanna talk to Pearl.
- Oh, all right.

534
00:54:12,435 --> 00:54:13,924
I'll just uh...

535
00:54:14,981 --> 00:54:19,564
Pearl... come here.

536
00:54:24,258 --> 00:54:26,784
- Was he all right?
- What?

537
00:54:27,863 --> 00:54:32,066
Was he, you know, satisfying
to you, was he all right.

538
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:37,272
You've been married to the man 10 years
anybody knows that it ought to be you.

539
00:54:37,991 --> 00:54:43,789
Well, course he's always been fine for me,
but... he's the only man I've ever known.

540
00:54:44,034 --> 00:54:47,244
And you with your
broader experience

541
00:54:47,294 --> 00:54:52,288
might judge him differently
based on more stringent standards.

542
00:54:54,856 --> 00:54:59,100
- You phrased that real nice.
- Thank you.

543
00:55:04,991 --> 00:55:15,178
Well, based on my... stringent
standards, he stood up real good.

544
00:55:21,178 --> 00:55:24,363
- I'm pleased.
- The pleasure was all mine.

545
00:55:29,805 --> 00:55:36,938
Just before he... exploded,
did he shout anything?

546
00:55:38,715 --> 00:55:48,328
Well, I was kinda busy myself but,
uh... I... I think... glory, glory?

547
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,097
- That's it.
- Every time?

548
00:55:51,385 --> 00:55:55,947
Every time, every time.

549
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:14,183
Don't it... hurt you... thinking
about me with him... like that.

550
00:56:18,164 --> 00:56:22,555
Yeah... it does...

551
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:27,835
but not as much as the
thought of you leavin'.

552
00:56:33,627 --> 00:56:38,348
Water! I got water!<i> Water!

553
00:56:38,902 --> 00:56:42,310
<i>- Yea!
- Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

554
00:56:47,477 --> 00:56:51,755
I'm gonna get you wet!
I'm gonna get you wet!

555
00:56:51,805 --> 00:56:53,605
Water!

556
00:57:45,565 --> 00:57:47,287
There ya go, Hon.

557
00:57:47,656 --> 00:57:50,069
Family, this here is Royal Spencer,

558
00:57:50,111 --> 00:57:54,434
he owns the farm 30 miles over
to Riverdale... from church.

559
00:57:54,484 --> 00:57:56,312
<i>You wants some... somethin'
to eat or something, Royal?

560
00:57:56,489 --> 00:57:59,326
- Uh, no thank you.
- Maybe some coffee.

561
00:57:59,376 --> 00:58:01,281
- Coffee?
- Comin' right up.

562
00:58:01,331 --> 00:58:02,137
Coffee.

563
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:05,109
My wife just had a baby,
it's our first son.

564
00:58:05,159 --> 00:58:05,975
Uh-huh.

565
00:58:06,025 --> 00:58:07,849
We're having a shivaree
a week from Saturday and

566
00:58:07,891 --> 00:58:10,489
I'd like to invite you and the Mrs.

567
00:58:10,939 --> 00:58:13,457
Oh, well, Mrs. Hightower,

friend is Miss Hickson, and,

569
00:58:16,734 --> 00:58:19,388
as you might notice my wife
is doin' none too well.

570
00:58:19,438 --> 00:58:21,429
- She...
- She's dying.

571
00:58:21,749 --> 00:58:24,127
- Now, hush now, Nathan!
<i>- You and Pearl go.

572
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:26,779
- No, Amy.
-<i> She never stops workin'.

573
00:58:26,810 --> 00:58:30,310
and does everything I used
to and has nurse me as well.

574
00:58:30,535 --> 00:58:32,043
They oughta do 'er good.

575
00:58:32,093 --> 00:58:35,544
- Amy...
- Don't argue with me, just do it.

576
00:58:35,867 --> 00:58:37,723
You'll be fine.

577
00:58:43,241 --> 00:58:45,661
Well, wadaya think?

578
00:58:46,115 --> 00:58:50,592
Beautiful... maybe a tad too
beautiful for the folks around here.

579
00:58:50,759 --> 00:58:55,668
Yeah, that's what I figured,
it's the only party dress I still got.

580
00:58:56,272 --> 00:59:01,454
Well, maybe we can let out mine around
here and it would fit you just fine.

581
00:59:02,683 --> 00:59:06,843
Oh, I don't know, it's one thing
borrowin' a woman's husband,

582
00:59:06,893 --> 00:59:09,855
a party dress is a
whole other thing.

583
00:59:17,029 --> 00:59:23,632
- All right?
- Well, maybe a few more buttons... I think.

584
00:59:24,371 --> 00:59:25,540
Martin!

585
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:32,739
You need some water, Jessica'll fetch it for
ya and Jack and Nathan will start the fire.

586
00:59:32,789 --> 00:59:34,930
Nathan's pretty good with the...
with the matches now, and...

587
00:59:34,953 --> 00:59:38,632
We'll be fine, I'm feeling better.

588
00:59:44,504 --> 00:59:46,804
- Wait a second.
- What?

589
00:59:47,484 --> 00:59:49,517
Offer her your arm.

590
00:59:53,292 --> 00:59:58,706
- Why?
- Just... offer her your arm.

591
01:00:08,032 --> 01:00:10,429
You make a fine looking couple.

592
01:00:29,097 --> 01:00:32,005
Afternoon, good to see ya,
come on in.

593
01:00:32,455 --> 01:00:37,520
Food's over here, the dance has just
started, you go enjoy yourself.

594
01:01:29,021 --> 01:01:31,616
Excuse me, may I?

595
01:01:35,576 --> 01:01:39,942
My name is Jake Masterson,
I'm Royal's kin.

596
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:46,673
Woulda asked you t'dance earlier
but figured you was the Mrs.

597
01:01:46,723 --> 01:01:49,163
to that feller that come in here.

598
01:01:49,213 --> 01:01:52,459
<i>And Royal tells me you're just
staying with him and his wife.

599
01:01:52,801 --> 01:01:54,037
Um-hum.

600
01:01:54,263 --> 01:01:57,704
Ya know, you're the prettiest woman here.

601
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:01,935
The fact is, you're the prettiest woman
I've seen since I got here six months ago.

602
01:02:02,924 --> 01:02:05,668
I guess you're probably the
prettiest woman I ever seen.

603
01:02:06,302 --> 01:02:09,385
- I guess what I'm trying to say is...
- I'm pretty.

604
01:02:09,935 --> 01:02:11,139
Yep.

605
01:02:11,555 --> 01:02:14,787
I was wonderin' if I might be able to come
by and call on ya some evenin' and, uh...

606
01:02:14,899 --> 01:02:18,356
with the possible eye on the
venture of matrimony.

607
01:02:18,506 --> 01:02:20,767
Excuse me, thank you.

608
01:02:27,445 --> 01:02:29,814
- What did he want?
- To marry me.

609
01:02:29,864 --> 01:02:33,595
- What did ya say?
- Didn't have a chance to answer.

610
01:02:39,449 --> 01:02:40,530
Excuse me.

611
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:43,532
You've danced with her already and
now she's dancin' with who brung 'er.

612
01:02:43,582 --> 01:02:48,683
- I just want to finish our conversation.
- Your conversation is finished.

613
01:02:49,049 --> 01:02:51,709
Do that again and you're gonna regret it.

614
01:02:53,078 --> 01:02:55,720
Well, I'll take that chance.

615
01:02:57,591 --> 01:02:59,937
I coulda knocked his block
off, he was just lucky, he's a

616
01:02:59,987 --> 01:03:03,299
little faster and stronger, a little
more skilled than I was, I suppose.

617
01:03:03,705 --> 01:03:05,805
<i>Yeah, he was fortunate in that regard.

618
01:03:06,506 --> 01:03:09,443
Let's understand somethin',
I'm not sure property.

619
01:03:09,493 --> 01:03:13,049
We have a business arrangement,
a provisional business arrangement.

620
01:03:14,241 --> 01:03:19,177
And if certain eventualities should
come to pass and I become... your wife,

621
01:03:19,675 --> 01:03:24,029
then you'll be entitled to certain
expectations in regard to my behavior.

622
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:27,202
Until then, I'm gonna do
what I want with who I want.

623
01:03:27,252 --> 01:03:29,349
What in the hell are you
talking about doing

624
01:03:29,399 --> 01:03:31,776
a business arrangement after
how we've been together?

625
01:03:32,995 --> 01:03:34,484
That don't count for nothin'.

626
01:03:36,397 --> 01:03:37,964
In deference to
your wife's wishes,

627
01:03:38,069 --> 01:03:41,935
I've simply been servicing
certain of your biological needs.

628
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:44,177
It's all that easy.

629
01:03:47,962 --> 01:03:49,664
Whoa!

630
01:03:54,525 --> 01:03:56,515
Then how come when I
saw in that man's arms,

631
01:03:56,556 --> 01:04:00,364
it felt like someone was
banging a stake in my gut?

632
01:04:06,626 --> 01:04:09,062
Whoa there! Whoa!

633
01:04:17,733 --> 01:04:19,632
How'd you get here?

634
01:04:19,895 --> 01:04:23,618
Jessica helped me over, you can bring
the rest of my things in the morning.

635
01:04:23,885 --> 01:04:25,421
What happened to you?

636
01:04:26,049 --> 01:04:28,659
Oh, don't mind that.
What are you doin'?

637
01:04:29,406 --> 01:04:32,516
I want Pearl to move into
the house with you.

638
01:04:32,986 --> 01:04:36,118
<i>- No, Amy!</i>
- I can't do that.

639
01:04:36,586 --> 01:04:39,375
- That's your home.
- It ain't gonna be long now.

640
01:04:39,725 --> 01:04:43,011
It'd pleasure me considerable to
see <i>all of ya livin' like a family.

641
01:04:43,295 --> 01:04:46,407
- Considerable.
- No, absolutely not.

642
01:04:46,826 --> 01:04:49,155
Makes no sense my being in the house.

643
01:04:49,205 --> 01:04:52,381
I keep you awake all night, and I can't
rest with <i>the children playing.

644
01:04:52,431 --> 01:04:56,244
Well, I'll just march right on
over there and I'll keep 'em still.

645
01:04:58,144 --> 01:05:01,280
I don't imagine the next
while being too pretty.

646
01:05:01,706 --> 01:05:04,946
I'd rather the children didn't
have to see and hear everything,

647
01:05:06,449 --> 01:05:10,583
Please, it's what I want.

648
01:05:33,684 --> 01:05:39,261
...of three hundred dollars
is a hundred and five dollars.

649
01:05:39,611 --> 01:05:45,867
- 35 percent of four hundred dollars is...
- What?

650
01:05:45,917 --> 01:05:49,073
- A hundred and forty dollars!
- Yes!

651
01:06:53,788 --> 01:06:56,691
It's been three days since
she's kept anything down.

652
01:07:14,515 --> 01:07:19,030
<i>It's okay, honey, come on in.

653
01:07:22,322 --> 01:07:24,675
It's okay.

654
01:07:38,031 --> 01:07:41,063
We don't have to do this now.
We shouldn't do this now.

655
01:07:41,657 --> 01:07:45,690
Yes we do, got to do it now,
got to do it proper.

656
01:07:46,734 --> 01:07:49,910
<i>- You want me to stay?</i>
- Course.

657
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:52,499
<i>Gotta have witnesses.

658
01:07:54,427 --> 01:07:56,130
Oh, honey... right?

659
01:07:59,104 --> 01:08:03,479
<i>The last will...
and... testament of...

660
01:08:03,729 --> 01:08:06,457
How do you spell "testament"?

661
01:08:07,711 --> 01:08:12,786
I don't remember.
Just do it how it sounds, it'll be fine.

662
01:08:13,950 --> 01:08:17,310
Amy Marigold Hightower.

663
01:08:18,204 --> 01:08:20,593
I didn't know ya had a middle name.

664
01:08:22,297 --> 01:08:27,085
- I never liked it much.
- I think it's pretty.

665
01:08:31,581 --> 01:08:34,805
To my beautiful... daughter Jessica,

666
01:08:35,030 --> 01:08:42,283
I leave my...
<i>jade pin that was my grandma Reba's.

667
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:46,726
And... to Nathan I leave
my volume of poetry.

668
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:49,644
And to Jack...

669
01:08:51,802 --> 01:08:56,293
to Jack I leave my daddy's silver tie pin.

670
01:08:56,875 --> 01:08:59,899
<i>And... to my precious baby Margaret,

671
01:08:59,949 --> 01:09:05,762
my photograph in my diary
so she may know me a little bit.

672
01:09:06,286 --> 01:09:11,515
And to my adoring friend Pearl...

673
01:09:12,996 --> 01:09:16,510
all my dresses she can find use for.

674
01:09:16,710 --> 01:09:19,298
In particular...

675
01:09:20,116 --> 01:09:22,112
but you can leave that one out...

676
01:09:22,162 --> 01:09:25,193
my wedding dress.

677
01:09:30,050 --> 01:09:33,097
And to my loving husband, Martin...

678
01:09:33,147 --> 01:09:38,284
my share of the claim and all
the rest of my worldly goods.

679
01:09:41,753 --> 01:09:43,780
Did ya get that, honey?

680
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:46,314
Most of it, I reckon.

681
01:09:47,112 --> 01:09:49,027
Let me sign it.

682
01:09:58,416 --> 01:10:02,002
I need you to sign, here.

683
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:15,787
Jessy, come here, you go in and see to the
children's supper, it's in the stove.

684
01:11:45,767 --> 01:11:49,140
<i>- Can I have a piece of bacon?
- Sure, go ahead..

685
01:11:50,701 --> 01:11:52,498
G'mornin'.

686
01:11:53,729 --> 01:11:57,492
Just had a hand for some Johnny cakes,
come and get it while it's hot.

687
01:12:04,410 --> 01:12:06,093
Come on.

688
01:12:25,096 --> 01:12:27,507
Okay, I'll be right back.

689
01:12:29,091 --> 01:12:32,920
Oh, why don't you let me do that?
You go help Martin with the shoeing.

690
01:12:33,258 --> 01:12:35,523
You shouldn't overdo it,
why don't you go lie down?

691
01:12:35,737 --> 01:12:39,281
I don't ever want to... lie down again.

692
01:12:40,013 --> 01:12:44,726
I just want to run and jump
and dance and eat like a pig.

693
01:12:44,776 --> 01:12:46,603
I feel so good.

694
01:12:47,587 --> 01:12:49,809
I guess God wasn't ready for me yet.

695
01:12:50,546 --> 01:12:54,189
Maybe hell was so crowded nowadays,
they're using Nebraska for the overflow.

696
01:12:54,847 --> 01:12:57,944
It feels so good, it feels so good.

697
01:13:35,575 --> 01:13:39,344
<i>Go to her, Martin.

698
01:13:41,143 --> 01:13:43,796
You're her husband.

699
01:13:46,091 --> 01:13:49,102
You belong in her bed, not mine.

700
01:13:51,988 --> 01:13:57,294
- You love her don't you?
- I'll always love 'er.

701
01:13:58,746 --> 01:14:02,321
I was merely substitutin'
for her during her indisposition.

702
01:14:03,175 --> 01:14:05,408
I thought it might be permanent.

703
01:14:05,769 --> 01:14:07,720
Isn't that so?

704
01:14:09,479 --> 01:14:11,542
Go on!

705
01:14:17,513 --> 01:14:22,377
Ya know, it just ain't right, first she says
me to you, and now you send me to her and...

706
01:14:23,490 --> 01:14:27,384
I feel like some great big
old Indian rubber ball.

707
01:14:36,716 --> 01:14:41,533
It's all right... go on.

708
01:14:45,969 --> 01:14:49,875
It's just real confusin' bein' a man.

709
01:16:31,610 --> 01:16:32,677
Where do you think you're goin'?

710
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:34,359
Stage Coach Station.

711
01:16:34,409 --> 01:16:36,081
- No you ain't.
- Yes, I am.

712
01:16:36,232 --> 01:16:39,245
I got no place back there
now, you know that's so.

713
01:16:39,525 --> 01:16:42,286
Just like that, just up and go? Whoa!

714
01:16:42,855 --> 01:16:45,294
I was hoping to avoid
this very conversation.

715
01:16:45,344 --> 01:16:47,226
Well, it ain't fair, we had an arrangement.

716
01:16:47,442 --> 01:16:51,516
Yeah, that's right, we did, and you didn't
keep up your end, you didn't go belly up.

717
01:16:51,566 --> 01:16:53,298
You just can't trust some people.

718
01:16:54,999 --> 01:16:58,533
We woulda lost the farm if it weren't for
all you've done, and we owe you so much.

719
01:16:58,898 --> 01:17:02,605
Not as much as you think,
I took $20 and the egg money.

720
01:17:03,775 --> 01:17:08,168
These last months, I didn't
exactly get nothing from 'em.

721
01:17:08,732 --> 01:17:13,573
In fact, if you just give me a ride
to the station, it might be near quick.

722
01:17:34,034 --> 01:17:37,585
- So where are you going?
- Oh, maybe Oregon.

723
01:17:37,964 --> 01:17:41,321
- Got lots of lumber camps up there.
- What are ya gonna do?

724
01:17:42,204 --> 01:17:45,301
- No, Pearl!
- It's what I do best.

725
01:17:45,631 --> 01:17:47,360
I don't know what I'm going to do.

726
01:17:47,573 --> 01:17:50,944
But if I'd wanted a husband, I wouldn't
have any trouble around these parts.

727
01:17:51,114 --> 01:17:53,802
Put a skirt on a warthog,
somebody'd marry it.

728
01:17:54,059 --> 01:17:57,209
I guess a husband and a family just
ain't what I want, that's all.

729
01:17:57,784 --> 01:18:00,875
- Why not?
- Who knows?

730
01:18:00,925 --> 01:18:05,213
I do, within your heart, you already
have a husband and family, it's mine.

731
01:18:07,113 --> 01:18:08,677
Whoa!

732
01:18:09,144 --> 01:18:11,395
You ain't leavin',
we're gonna work something out.

733
01:18:11,577 --> 01:18:14,742
This farm is your home, you belong here.

734
01:18:15,407 --> 01:18:19,551
- What about your husband?
- We'll work something out there, too.

735
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:29,643
<i>It makes such perfect
sense, there's way too

736
01:18:29,693 --> 01:18:31,728
<i>much work for all of
us to do around here.

737
01:18:31,978 --> 01:18:32,914
<i>So it'll be like this...

738
01:18:32,977 --> 01:18:34,654
<i>I'll do the housework
and </i> Pearl'll help you

739
01:18:34,704 --> 01:18:36,982
in the field one day,
and the next day we switch.

740
01:18:37,190 --> 01:18:40,384
That way you'll always have a helper
and life will be easier for everyone.

741
01:18:40,682 --> 01:18:41,776
Sounds practical.

742
01:18:42,245 --> 01:18:45,077
<i>Now, Pearl's insisted on
moving back in the shed.

743
01:18:45,527 --> 01:18:47,191
<i>But I figured with all
of us working, you'll have

744
01:18:47,241 --> 01:18:49,305
<i>time to put that addition
on we were talking about

745
01:18:49,355 --> 01:18:51,300
<i>and Pearl have our
own room right in here.

746
01:18:51,847 --> 01:18:54,894
- I'll get started on it right after planting.
-<i> Good.

747
01:18:54,944 --> 01:18:58,300
And there's one other thing, since Pearl
and me gonna be sharing all the chores,

748
01:18:58,350 --> 01:19:00,980
the cooking the cleaning,
the laundry,<i> the child rearing,

749
01:19:01,030 --> 01:19:03,637
<i>I think it's only fair</i>  that
we should share everything...

750
01:19:04,226 --> 01:19:07,192
including... your attentions.

751
01:19:10,804 --> 01:19:12,913
What exactly you proposin'?

752
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:16,708
Well, you have a deep
feeling for me, don't you?

753
01:19:17,470 --> 01:19:19,093
You're my wife, Amy.

754
01:19:19,366 --> 01:19:22,984
And you have a deep feeling
for Pearl, too, right?

755
01:19:25,291 --> 01:19:26,451
Well, yeah.

756
01:19:26,485 --> 01:19:28,290
We both have similar feelings for you.

757
01:19:28,481 --> 01:19:31,679
So I don't see any reason why all these
feelings shouldn't be accommodated.

758
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:33,233
You don't?

759
01:19:35,184 --> 01:19:36,682
Well, what about God?

760
01:19:37,420 --> 01:19:40,303
Why are you always bringing
him into it, he won't mind?

761
01:19:40,453 --> 01:19:43,864
King Solomon was God's Anointed
and he had 1000 wives.

762
01:19:43,914 --> 01:19:47,965
And those Mormons, they're Christians
and they have as many wives as they want.

763
01:19:48,745 --> 01:19:51,941
Well, I ain't no king
and I ain't no Mormon.

764
01:19:52,599 --> 01:19:54,247
So how was you plannin' on doing it?

765
01:19:54,297 --> 01:19:56,964
Is it like the housework, she
gets me Monday, <i>Wednesday, Friday,

766
01:19:57,039 --> 01:19:58,826
<i>you get me Tuesday,
Thursday, Saturday?

767
01:19:59,158 --> 01:20:02,893
<i>Or maybe you was plannin' on us all
bouncing around </i> in bed all at once.

768
01:20:03,209 --> 01:20:06,968
Well, sorry Martin. I just thought
you might like the idea.

769
01:20:07,018 --> 01:20:10,695
I didn't say I didn't like it,
Amy, I said it aren't right.

770
01:20:11,341 --> 01:20:13,104
And it is right for Pearl<i> to leave here,

771
01:20:13,136 --> 01:20:16,729
<i>no place to go when we promised</i>
her this would be her home?

772
01:20:17,438 --> 01:20:21,422
Well, no it aren't,
but she can stay here without...

773
01:20:21,472 --> 01:20:26,307
No she can't!
A woman has needs, too, just like a man.

774
01:20:27,057 --> 01:20:29,811
- She does?
-<i> Yes.

775
01:20:30,347 --> 01:20:31,316
<i>And it's more than that,

776
01:20:31,646 --> 01:20:34,700
Pearl has a very
special attachment to you.

777
01:20:52,341 --> 01:20:55,439
You've been with me,
you've been with Pearl.

778
01:20:56,697 --> 01:20:59,249
Yeah, but whilst I was with you,
I was just with you,

779
01:20:59,299 --> 01:21:01,358
and whilst I was with Pearl,
I was just with Pearl,

780
01:21:01,381 --> 01:21:04,682
I didn't go switching back
and forth, night to night.

781
01:21:05,203 --> 01:21:08,115
What if it wasn't switching
back and forth, night to night?

782
01:21:08,165 --> 01:21:12,911
What if it was... say, half... half a
year with her and half a year with me?

783
01:21:20,111 --> 01:21:25,027
Well, that might make a difference
seems a little more... dignified.

784
01:21:28,763 --> 01:21:31,465
Yep, it might make a difference to me.

785
01:21:32,495 --> 01:21:35,195
I think that can be arranged,
what do you think, Pearl?

786
01:21:38,898 --> 01:21:41,063
Who gets winter?

787
01:21:42,281 --> 01:21:44,322
We'll draw a straw.

788
01:21:45,232 --> 01:21:47,427
I think we managed
that right well.

789
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:50,439
Let's seal it with the kiss.

790
01:21:54,476 --> 01:21:56,133
<i>Come on.

791
01:21:58,588 --> 01:21:59,998
Well...

792
01:22:02,656 --> 01:22:08,311
ya know, we might not have
to wait exactly... half a year.

793
01:22:10,095 --> 01:22:14,248
I think... three months might work fine.

794
01:22:23,739 --> 01:22:28,184
Or maybe one...
one month might do.

795
01:22:30,516 --> 01:22:32,221
<i>Or...

796
01:22:35,562 --> 01:22:37,725
tell you what...

797
01:22:37,895 --> 01:22:39,938
one week might do fine...

798
01:22:39,988 --> 01:22:42,612
long as it wasn't... ya know...

799
01:22:43,926 --> 01:22:46,198
- Back and forth, night to night?
-<i> Right!

800
01:22:47,244 --> 01:22:49,407
At first anyways.

801
01:24:16,590 --> 01:24:18,854
Pretty cold night.

802
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:25,820
- Pearl must be freezing in that shed.
- I hope she's alright.

803
01:24:46,491 --> 01:24:48,132
Ain't it pretty?

804
01:24:49,424 --> 01:24:51,406
I'll get your candy for ya.

805
01:24:52,817 --> 01:24:54,980
Here it is, here it is!

806
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:03,251
Here ya go.

807
01:25:03,301 --> 01:25:05,190
How do you know you're gonna like this?

808
01:25:05,234 --> 01:25:08,931
You never tasted molasses candy before,
how do you know?

809
01:25:09,398 --> 01:25:12,023
You know! Yeah!

810
01:25:35,111 --> 01:25:39,079
You're gonna get better,
just like last time, I promise ya.

811
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:41,344
I hope so.

812
01:25:48,459 --> 01:25:52,185
I better put this little one to bed.

813
01:25:56,706 --> 01:25:58,206
Pearl.

814
01:25:59,928 --> 01:26:01,577
Pearl.

815
01:26:05,945 --> 01:26:09,318
Ya know, a little while
ago you helped me out back,

816
01:26:09,831 --> 01:26:12,608
- you know what I was thinkin'?
- What?

817
01:26:13,309 --> 01:26:16,945
Right when I was doing it,
I was thinking this here's my last pee.

818
01:26:17,053 --> 01:26:19,248
Oh... Amy.

819
01:26:19,298 --> 01:26:21,999
I haven't really appreciated it before.

820
01:26:22,054 --> 01:26:23,512
I'm gonna miss it.

821
01:26:23,923 --> 01:26:26,098
It's a real good thing.

822
01:26:26,450 --> 01:26:28,290
You ever notice?

823
01:26:29,027 --> 01:26:35,370
No... well...
try t'pay it more heed in the future.

824
01:26:36,514 --> 01:26:39,378
Ya know, you had bad spells before.

825
01:26:44,003 --> 01:26:47,344
Nathan... he's got a real good head...

826
01:26:47,894 --> 01:26:52,110
they build that high school up<i>
in Holdrege, you make him go.

827
01:26:53,259 --> 01:26:56,460
Jessica, she's just got
to know your love her,

828
01:26:56,510 --> 01:26:59,711
ya gotta to tell her
every day, or she forgets.

829
01:27:01,876 --> 01:27:06,467
<i>Then Jack, he'll try to see what
he can get away with, but...

830
01:27:06,893 --> 01:27:09,928
<i>just let him know what the
limits are and he'll accept 'em.

831
01:27:11,338 --> 01:27:13,026
<i>Then Margaret...

832
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:18,515
a little early the tell,
but... I think she's gonna be a beauty.

833
01:27:20,318 --> 01:27:22,931
Still ain't no reason to spoil her.

834
01:27:25,406 --> 01:27:29,280
- Spoil her a little.
- Yeah, okay.

835
01:27:34,953 --> 01:27:37,249
Any tips on how to handle your husband?

836
01:27:37,345 --> 01:27:39,948
Oh... well...

837
01:27:41,325 --> 01:27:43,161
Someday years from now
you and him are going to

838
01:27:43,252 --> 01:27:46,717
be having some argument about
something or another, and...

839
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:53,007
he'll make some nasty reference
to your life before you came here.

840
01:27:53,516 --> 01:27:59,018
Of course he'll feel rotten about it and
be all contrite and beg you to forgive him.

841
01:28:00,798 --> 01:28:03,212
You will forgive him, won't you?

842
01:28:03,805 --> 01:28:05,072
Sure I will...

843
01:28:05,322 --> 01:28:09,175
right after I knock him right
upside the head with the iron pot.

844
01:28:12,814 --> 01:28:13,977
Is that all right?

845
01:28:14,166 --> 01:28:22,482
Well, the pot's a might extreme, but...
the philosophy's good.

846
01:28:25,639 --> 01:28:27,881
You gotta get some rest.

847
01:28:38,664 --> 01:28:40,097
<i>Pearl.

848
01:28:43,749 --> 01:28:46,652
A while ago, I was talking to my maker,

849
01:28:46,999 --> 01:28:49,883
and I was real angry with him.

850
01:28:50,237 --> 01:28:55,657
And I was asking him, "Why?
Why do you want to take me so soon?"

851
01:28:58,283 --> 01:29:00,377
I realized...

852
01:29:01,152 --> 01:29:06,984
it's the only way he could figure
it out to get me to meet you.

853
01:29:08,312 --> 01:29:10,675
It shut me up real good.

854
01:29:28,669 --> 01:29:32,674
Lord, thou hast been our
dwelling place in all generations.

855
01:29:33,061 --> 01:29:35,483
Before the mountains
were brought forth,

856
01:29:35,533 --> 01:29:40,293
for even thou hast formed the earth in the
world,<i> from everlasting to everlasting.

857
01:29:40,343 --> 01:29:44,491
<i>Thou art with God, the Lord
shall preserve thee from all evil,

858
01:29:44,541 --> 01:29:48,038
<i>yea, it is even He that shall keep thy soul.

859
01:29:48,251 --> 01:29:50,511
<i>The Lord shall preserve thy going </i>out

860
01:29:50,904 --> 01:29:56,334
and thy coming in,
from this time forth, for forevermore.

861
01:29:57,980 --> 01:30:01,677
<i>Do you take this man to be
your lawfully wedded husband,

862
01:30:01,691 --> 01:30:04,982
to have and to hold,
to love and to cherish,

863
01:30:05,032 --> 01:30:09,495
in sickness and in health,
until death do you part?

864
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:10,859
I do.

865
01:30:10,909 --> 01:30:14,899
<i>And do you Edwin Jerome Beasley
take Jessica Anne Hightower

866
01:30:15,006 --> 01:30:17,371
<i>to have and to hold,
to love and to cherish,

867
01:30:17,421 --> 01:30:20,676
<i>in sickness and in health,
till death do you part?

868
01:30:22,634 --> 01:30:25,728
<i>Today, by the power vested
in me by this church,

869
01:30:25,747 --> 01:30:30,391
<i>and by the State of Nebraska,
I pronounce you husband and wife.

870
01:30:50,709 --> 01:30:53,384
My word!

871
01:30:54,162 --> 01:30:57,165
You'd think it was our wedding night.

872
01:30:57,221 --> 01:31:01,107
I'm a very fortunate man.
