Flavor Flav, you've done it again.

4
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:33,803
He's gotta come outside.

5
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,238
Every time we waste our time here,
we always missin' games.

6
00:04:37,455 --> 00:04:39,455
Yo, Bleek!

7
00:04:39,672 --> 00:04:41,455
Yo, Bleek!

8
00:04:41,673 --> 00:04:45,368
- You coming out to play?
- You're wasting time on him.

9
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:47,977

10
00:04:48,194 --> 00:04:50,064
We're going to miss the game!

11
00:04:50,976 --> 00:04:53,630
Boys! Boys!

12
00:04:53,846 --> 00:04:56,498
Boys, please be quiet!

13
00:04:56,716 --> 00:04:59,847
Sorry, Mrs Gilliam, we wanted to know
if Bleek can come out.

14
00:05:00,065 --> 00:05:03,325
l understand that,
but this noise has got to stop.

15
00:05:03,542 --> 00:05:05,847
- Psst!
- Oh, man!

16
00:05:09,195 --> 00:05:10,717
Bleek.

17
00:05:10,934 --> 00:05:13,152
<i>Bleek!</i>

18
00:05:13,369 --> 00:05:15,978
l told you to tell your friends
not to come around.

19
00:05:16,195 --> 00:05:17,935
Leave the boy alone.

20
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,673
- Can l go outside now?
- When you've finished.

21
00:05:20,891 --> 00:05:22,848
- What about then?
- We'll see.

22
00:05:23,065 --> 00:05:28,195
- Let the boy be a boy, have some fun.
- He could be a bum for all you care.

23
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:30,369
Running the streets with those kids.

24
00:05:30,587 --> 00:05:34,587
<i>Almost wlthln walklng dlstance

<i>He ls just 21 years old.</i>

26
00:05:38,587 --> 00:05:42,848
That child's going to drive me
up the wall. Go tell them to go home.

27
00:05:43,065 --> 00:05:46,414
- You don't let me do nothing.
- You hear what l said?

28
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,935
Go tell him to go home.

29

Yo, Ty,

- You!
- You're a sissy, sissy.

43
00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:28,414

l'll come down.

44
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:33,632
- Man, he does this every time.
- Thanks for nothing.

45
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:36,240
We'll win the game without you.

46
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:39,328
Bleek!
Get your butt out of that window.

47
00:06:44,415 --> 00:06:46,372
Throw the ball, man!

48
00:06:48,502 --> 00:06:50,893
Mommy,
l never get to play with my friends.

49
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:53,807
Now they callin' me a sissy.
l ain't no sissy.

50
00:06:54,023 --> 00:06:57,807
- A sissy?!
- Don't pay those fools no mind.

51
00:06:58,023 --> 00:07:01,806
l'm sick and tired of the trumpet.
l hate the trumpet!

52
00:07:02,024 --> 00:07:05,763
All the money l paid for that horn?
You must be losing your mind.

53
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,589
- You better play that trumpet.
- Look...

54
00:07:08,807 --> 00:07:10,937
That child will drive me up the wall.

55
00:07:11,154 --> 00:07:14,459
- Don't say that.
- l can say it if l want to...

56
00:07:14,677 --> 00:07:17,459
You got a lot of time
to be with your friends.

57
00:07:17,677 --> 00:07:20,459
- Like when?
- l don't want you to grow up like them.

58
00:07:20,676 --> 00:07:25,198
- After your lessons.
- l have to play this stupid trumpet.

59
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:30,199
- This instrument can be your friend.
- Shut up! Shut up!

60
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,503
- l'm not having this.
- We'll go to a game.

61
00:07:32,721 --> 00:07:34,894
- l don't want to go.
- l got a game on, OK?

62
00:07:35,112 --> 00:07:37,155
- Go look at it.
- You spoiled him rotten.

63
00:07:37,372 --> 00:07:42,417
He's not worth a damn. Listen.
Shut up! Don't you talk back to me.

64
00:07:42,633 --> 00:07:47,547
l want you to pick up the horn,
and you're going to play the scales.

65
00:07:47,764 --> 00:07:51,112
Do you hear me?
And you're going to do it right now.

66
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:55,590
Boy, l think you better do
what your mother says, OK? Now?

67
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,808
<i>Moose ls worklng on a no-hltter.</i>

68
00:07:59,025 --> 00:08:00,982
l still hate it.

69
00:08:06,852 --> 00:08:11,635
Good boy. Damn. l'm missing the game.
lt's for the pennant here.

70
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:08,854
He's a chucker, man.
He comes off the bench shooting, Bleek.

71
00:10:09,072 --> 00:10:13,681
Never gonna see no pass from this guy.
He's a selfish ballplayer.

72
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:15,681
You need to get rid of him.

73
00:10:15,898 --> 00:10:20,160
lt's your team. lt's your band.
You're the coach. Fire his ass.

74
00:10:20,377 --> 00:10:23,377
Every night, three-hour solos.
Bleek, what's up?

75
00:10:23,595 --> 00:10:25,550
lt's your band.

76
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:29,986
Get rid of this guy.
Go out there and play.

77
00:10:30,203 --> 00:10:31,855
Great.

78
00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:33,159
God.

79
00:10:33,377 --> 00:10:35,812
Bleek, just talk to the guy, all right?

80
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,029
Talk to him.

81
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,031
All right!

82
00:11:30,248 --> 00:11:32,901
Left Hand Lacey on the piano.

83
00:11:33,117 --> 00:11:35,683
Left Hand.

84
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:41,423
The earl himself.
The earl of rhythm.

85
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,249
- Rhythm Jones on the drums.
- Thank you. Thank you.

86
00:11:44,466 --> 00:11:46,771
On the bottom, the bass,
Bottom Hammer.

87
00:11:46,987 --> 00:11:50,640
- Rock bottom, that's my man!
- Bottom Hammer.

88
00:11:50,857 --> 00:11:55,684

90
00:12:01,031 --> 00:12:04,988

91
00:12:05,205 --> 00:12:06,944
- He's the best, that guy.
- The best.

92
00:12:07,162 --> 00:12:09,031
Your band! lt's your band!

93
00:12:09,902 --> 00:12:11,989
Thank you for coming.
You didn't have to.

94
00:12:12,206 --> 00:12:15,640
You could have stayed home
and watched Arsenio Hall or something.

95
00:12:15,858 --> 00:12:19,640
No, listen,
l got nothing against the brother.

96
00:12:19,858 --> 00:12:23,119
But er... thank you again for coming.

97
00:12:23,336 --> 00:12:25,945
This concludes our first set.
We'll be back soon.

98
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:30,510
We got some beautiful waitresses here,
so put them to work.

99
00:12:30,728 --> 00:12:32,945
Give them some business and a fat tip.

100
00:12:34,467 --> 00:12:35,771
Speaking of fat...

101
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:39,163
Don't get mad, Bleek.
l'll kick your ass.

102
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,815
l know l'm gonna hear it now.
Butterbean.

103
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,685
Whoo!

104
00:12:51,468 --> 00:12:54,380
Nice, boy. Nice set.

105
00:12:54,598 --> 00:12:57,641
You see them girls out in front?
The girl in purple?

106
00:12:57,859 --> 00:13:00,120
When she crossed her legs,
l saw sparks fly.

107
00:13:00,337 --> 00:13:03,251
- What's up, man?
- She got a big baseball booty.

108
00:13:03,468 --> 00:13:05,250
Oh, man, she was fine!

109
00:13:05,468 --> 00:13:07,425
She was looking at me the whole show.

110
00:13:08,468 --> 00:13:11,729
She was looking at me
the whole motherfucking show, man.

111
00:13:11,946 --> 00:13:14,816
Yo, cut the bullshit, hold up.

112
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:18,469
Shadow, what's up with this ego stuff?
What's up with the outing?

113
00:13:18,685 --> 00:13:21,425
- Grandstanding!
- You're the only one complaining.

114
00:13:21,642 --> 00:13:24,207
- Everybody else is OK.
- Everybody who?

115
00:13:24,425 --> 00:13:26,251
The audience got no problem.

116
00:13:26,468 --> 00:13:28,946
All you doing
is playing for the audience?

117
00:13:29,164 --> 00:13:31,947
- That's what l do.
- That's ego, grandstanding.

118
00:13:32,164 --> 00:13:36,425
- Do l tell you what to play?
- ls your name on the marquee?

119
00:13:36,643 --> 00:13:39,947
- Shadow sounds good, man.
- Who asked you, Left Hand?

120
00:13:40,164 --> 00:13:43,425
- Nobody asked me.
- Well, shut the fuck up!

121
00:13:43,643 --> 00:13:47,991
What the fuck is this?
You shut the fuck up, you midget!

122
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:52,426
- My name is Giant, all right?
- Blame your motherfucking mother, man.

123
00:13:52,643 --> 00:13:56,426
- On the real side.
- Why you talking about my mother, man?

124
00:13:56,643 --> 00:14:00,035
- Stop talking about my mother.
- On the real side.

125
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:06,991
Yo, chill.
Everybody chill for one second.

126
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:10,513
Relax on the solos, OK?
Bring them down a little bit, all right?

127
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,165
- Could you do that for me?
- Down to an hour.

128
00:14:13,382 --> 00:14:15,295
Maybe an hour, 45 minutes?

129
00:14:16,035 --> 00:14:18,165
You do have an option.
You can always quit.

130
00:14:19,774 --> 00:14:22,469
- What?
- Don't be playing with my balls.

131
00:14:22,687 --> 00:14:25,557
- Yo, hold up, man.
- Here, take your balls.

132
00:14:26,818 --> 00:14:30,036
Well, you right.
You right. l could quit.

133
00:14:30,252 --> 00:14:32,992
- Hey, wait a minute!
- He ain't going nowhere.

134
00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:35,992
- Where you going?
- To the bathroom, right?

135
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,209
- l'm going to the bathroom.
- He's always going.

136
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:45,818
l like women with big asses.
Why brothers drive Oadillacs.

137
00:14:46,035 --> 00:14:48,210
Can't get all that ass in a Volkswagen.

138
00:14:49,732 --> 00:14:52,470
The first thing they be saying,
''Kiss my ass''.

139
00:14:55,689 --> 00:14:59,123
Some ugly women in here, too, tonight.

140
00:14:59,993 --> 00:15:02,689
How you doing?

141
00:15:02,862 --> 00:15:05,732

Pretty woman, too...
You know how they do.

144
00:15:14,645 --> 00:15:17,210
''Fuck you. l'll do what l want to do.''

145
00:15:17,428 --> 00:15:20,863
Ugly woman easy to get along with.
They don't want no trouble.

146
00:15:22,385 --> 00:15:24,949
You can tell an ugly woman anything,
can't you?

147
00:15:25,211 --> 00:15:30,602
Hey, bitch, l'm going to the moon.

148
00:15:30,819 --> 00:15:33,081
''Well, you be careful.''

''l don't want nothing to happen
to you now, cos you know l...

150
00:15:37,429 --> 00:15:39,776

00:15:39,993 --> 00:15:41,950
''Oh, l love you.''

152
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:46,211
''Please don't call me a bitch
in front of the kids.''

153
00:15:46,428 --> 00:15:49,993
All right, whore, l'll be back

154
00:16:31,864 --> 00:16:35,256
Hey. Hey, wake up.

158
00:16:45,734 --> 00:16:47,691

161
00:16:55,257 --> 00:16:57,039
You'll be late for school.

162
00:16:57,256 --> 00:17:00,082
Your children will have
their little hearts broken.

163
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,692
Yeah, speaking of broken hearts, Bleek,

164
00:17:02,908 --> 00:17:05,213
you know what my mother
used to tell me?

165
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:08,691
She used to say,
''Don't ever marry a musician,

166
00:17:08,909 --> 00:17:11,431
let alone go out with one.''

167
00:17:11,648 --> 00:17:18,344
She said l'd be inviting grief and pain
and tears and heartbreak to my doorstep.

168
00:17:18,561 --> 00:17:20,822
Your mother wasn't talking about me.

169
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,997
Maybe not.

170
00:17:23,213 --> 00:17:28,040
You're a good brother, Bleek,
but you still don't know what you want.

171
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:31,518
Guess it's time for confessions
of a modern-day dog, huh?

172
00:17:31,736 --> 00:17:35,431
Well,... like it or not,...
you're a dog.

173
00:17:36,867 --> 00:17:38,954
You are a dog.

174
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:43,867
You're a good doggy, a nice dog,
but you're a dog nonetheless.

175
00:17:44,084 --> 00:17:47,344
What can l say?
l'm not going to argue the point.

176
00:17:47,562 --> 00:17:49,475
You know how l am.

177
00:17:50,562 --> 00:17:52,736
- With men, it's a dick thing.
- A dick thing?

178
00:17:52,954 --> 00:17:54,867
A D-l-O-K thing.

179
00:17:58,388 --> 00:18:00,867
A D-l-O-K thing.

180
00:18:09,954 --> 00:18:11,867
Hey, Bleek, you're late.

181
00:18:12,084 --> 00:18:13,302
Three minutes.

182
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,127
Probably one of your lady friends
held you up.

183
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:20,562
- Hi, Mr Gilliam.
- Hello.

184
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:24,041
Sorry l can't stop. l'm late for school.
Bye-bye.

185
00:18:28,563 --> 00:18:31,824
- What?
- You something else, you know that?

186
00:18:33,302 --> 00:18:36,868
- How's the arm?
- l'm off the disabled list.

187
00:18:40,693 --> 00:18:42,215
You love her?

188
00:18:42,433 --> 00:18:44,433
l like her.

189
00:18:44,651 --> 00:18:46,954
You like her.
What about the others?

190
00:18:47,172 --> 00:18:50,042
l like her, too. l like women.

191
00:18:54,303 --> 00:18:56,259
Just be careful.

192
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,259
Don't bring babies into this world
until you're married.

193
00:19:01,477 --> 00:19:04,129
lf l see another 16-year-old,
black, unwed mother,

194
00:19:04,347 --> 00:19:07,738
pushing a stroller, a baby in one arm,
another on the way,

195
00:19:07,956 --> 00:19:09,216
l don't know what l'll do.

196
00:19:09,434 --> 00:19:12,216
- l hear you.
- l can still smoke 'em.

197
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,303
Come on with it.

198
00:19:15,477 --> 00:19:17,825
That's it, that's it.
That's enough.

199
00:19:18,043 --> 00:19:19,391
l felt a twinge.

200
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:22,956
Come upstairs.
l'll ice it down for you.

201
00:19:23,173 --> 00:19:25,129
No. l'm going back home.

202
00:19:25,347 --> 00:19:27,304
All right. l'll call you later.

203
00:19:27,521 --> 00:19:28,478
All right.

204
00:19:28,695 --> 00:19:33,130
- Take care of that arm, all right?
- lt's just old age.

205
00:21:29,394 --> 00:21:31,655
<i>- Olarke, what time is it?
- One o'clock pm.</i>

206
00:21:31,872 --> 00:21:34,089
<i>- What does that mean?
- You're practlslng.</i>

207
00:21:34,307 --> 00:21:36,612
That's right.
lt means l'm practising.

208
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:40,829
lf you know l'm practising
and l don't finish practising till 2:00,

209
00:21:41,046 --> 00:21:43,959
which is another 60 minutes,
why you buzzing my buzzer?

210
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:46,090
<i>Because l want to see you.</i>

211
00:21:46,307 --> 00:21:49,437
<i>- What is that supposed to mean?
- That means let me up.</i>

212
00:21:49,655 --> 00:21:52,568
<i>- And who are you?
- l'm Clarke.</i>

213
00:21:54,308 --> 00:21:56,569
How many times
do l have to tell you?

214
00:21:56,786 --> 00:21:59,569
l have a certain time
allotted for daily practice.

215
00:21:59,786 --> 00:22:03,655
You know this, yet you
consistently overlook my programme.

216
00:22:07,134 --> 00:22:09,656
l get the times mixed up.

217
00:22:09,873 --> 00:22:12,612
Everything with you
is so damn regulated.

218
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,786
A certain time to do this,
a certain time to do that.

219
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:18,308
Everything's on a schedule, a timetable.

220
00:22:18,525 --> 00:22:22,352
- Loosen up, tight ass.
- Let me explain something to you.

221
00:22:22,569 --> 00:22:24,613
Life is short, OK?

222
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:28,134
l need it like this
to get everything done. l like order.

223
00:22:28,351 --> 00:22:31,439
Order's fine, but you're ridiculous.

224
00:22:33,438 --> 00:22:34,786
And what do you want?

225
00:22:35,004 --> 00:22:38,700
l want a man
who knows what he wants. Decisive.

226
00:22:38,918 --> 00:22:40,700
You don't know what you want.

227
00:22:40,917 --> 00:22:43,917
Make up your mind to be a man
and don't be wishy-washy on me.

228
00:22:46,874 --> 00:22:49,961
l know what l want. My music.
Everything else is secondary.

229
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:52,874
- l knew you would say that.
- Then why'd you ask?

230
00:22:58,266 --> 00:23:03,527
Brother,... if your music
is the be all to end all, as you state,

231
00:23:03,744 --> 00:23:07,701
to ensure that you better
get rid of Giant as your manager.

232
00:23:07,918 --> 00:23:10,788
Olarke, stay out of my business, OK?

233
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:16,484
Are you screwing him, or what?
He's a horrible manager.

234
00:23:16,701 --> 00:23:19,048
Everybody can see that but you.

235
00:23:19,266 --> 00:23:21,483
Why bring this confusion
into my home?

236
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:24,005
l'm looking out for your best interest.

237
00:23:24,223 --> 00:23:25,918
Oh.

238
00:23:26,745 --> 00:23:28,049
l see.

239
00:23:29,266 --> 00:23:30,440
- Bleek.
- Mm?

240
00:23:30,658 --> 00:23:35,702
l'm not saying l'm a brain surgeon,
but everybody's a teacher.

241
00:23:35,918 --> 00:23:41,354
People can teach you two things,
what to do and what not to do.

242
00:23:44,571 --> 00:23:46,745
Say something.

243
00:23:48,398 --> 00:23:50,353
Let's make love.

244
00:23:51,528 --> 00:23:53,746
For once, let's be real.

245
00:23:53,962 --> 00:23:56,832
What you and l do
is not ''make love''.

246
00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:00,137
- What would you call it?
- lt's definitely not making love.

247
00:24:00,354 --> 00:24:03,093
- Boning?
- You've been more imaginative.

248
00:24:03,311 --> 00:24:05,876
- You ever heard of the mo' better?
- Mo' what?

249
00:24:06,093 --> 00:24:08,311
Mo' better makes it mo' better.

250
00:24:08,485 --> 00:24:10,311
Mo' better makes it mo' better.

251
00:24:10,528 --> 00:24:14,267
That's what we do. We don't make love
because you don't love me.

252
00:24:15,615 --> 00:24:18,702
But in the meantime,
l'll settle for some of that mo' better.

253
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,877
Yeah. l knew you would.

254
00:24:25,702 --> 00:24:27,398
Step back.

255
00:24:28,268 --> 00:24:30,224
Open your coat.

256
00:24:36,485 --> 00:24:38,442
Take off your clothes.

257
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:34,008
Ow!

258
00:25:34,226 --> 00:25:37,009
- l'm sorry.
- You bit my lip.

259
00:25:37,226 --> 00:25:40,269
Oh, shit. ls it bleeding?
What you laughing at?

260
00:25:40,487 --> 00:25:43,226
- l was playing.
- Don't play with my lips.

261
00:25:45,008 --> 00:25:47,835
l'm sorry.
Jesus Christ, l said l'm sorry.

262
00:25:48,052 --> 00:25:50,400
Damn, she done cut my...

263
00:25:50,618 --> 00:25:51,878
You're nuts!

264
00:25:52,096 --> 00:25:54,227
Want me to kiss it
to make it mo' better?

265
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,879
This shit ain't funny, man.

266
00:25:57,096 --> 00:25:58,705
l was joking.

267
00:25:58,922 --> 00:26:01,792
All right, l won't ever kiss you again.

268
00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:03,531
That's good.

269
00:26:04,662 --> 00:26:06,314
l make my living with my lips.

270
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:08,618
l make my living with my lips.

271
00:26:12,836 --> 00:26:15,923
Why don't you clean this place up?
lt's filthy.

272
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:18,270
Oleanliness is next to godliness, right?

273
00:26:18,488 --> 00:26:20,705
This is the last time l carry you.

274
00:26:21,749 --> 00:26:24,531
l want to play the full schedule today.

275
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,836
Start with the National League.

276
00:26:27,053 --> 00:26:29,358
The Pirates play the Mets
in a doubleheader.

277
00:26:29,576 --> 00:26:33,880
Give me the Pirates in both games.
The Mets need more black ballplayers.

278
00:26:34,097 --> 00:26:35,793
Give me the Reds over the 'stros,

279
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:39,010
Expos over the Phillies,
Braves over the Dodgers,

280
00:26:39,184 --> 00:26:42,575
Oubs over the Oardinals,
the Giants over the Padres.

281
00:26:47,488 --> 00:26:50,184
ln the American League,
the Yankees over the Tigers,

282
00:26:50,402 --> 00:26:52,402
even though Steinbrenner needs to go.

283
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:55,706
Brewers over the Red Sox,
Orioles over the Jays.

284
00:26:55,924 --> 00:26:57,793
That's my main man, Frank Robinson.

285
00:26:58,011 --> 00:27:00,010
Yucca, barbecue, Oreo cookies.

286
00:27:00,228 --> 00:27:03,141
lndians over the White Sox,
the Twins over the Mariners,

287
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:05,620
A's over the Royals,
and Angels over Rangers.

288
00:27:05,837 --> 00:27:09,533
<i>lce cream, tamale, arroz, azucar.
All of that?</i>

289
00:27:09,706 --> 00:27:11,012
All of that.

290
00:27:11,228 --> 00:27:13,533
Give me two C-notes on each game.

291
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,272
- Can you cover that?
- Just make the bet.

292
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:17,750
Two C-notes on each?

293
00:27:17,968 --> 00:27:21,229
Two C-notes on each game.
l'm coming back, Petey.

294
00:27:21,447 --> 00:27:24,403
lt's never over till it's over.

295
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:27,185
- Will you stop with that?
- l rehearse my luck.

296
00:27:27,403 --> 00:27:29,360
This is my luck.

297
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,403
- What does it look like?
- lt looks good.

298
00:27:35,621 --> 00:27:38,185
The numbers look good.
Numbers never lie.

299
00:27:38,403 --> 00:27:41,968
That's why l like numbers. People
lie from the crib, but not numbers.

300
00:27:42,186 --> 00:27:44,230
Moe, the numbers never lie.

301
00:27:44,404 --> 00:27:47,186
- But human beings?
- Human beings is another story.

302
00:27:47,404 --> 00:27:49,229
You meet some shmendrick.

303
00:27:49,403 --> 00:27:53,273
The guy says ''Yes. No. Maybe''
but you never know, right?

304
00:27:53,491 --> 00:27:55,838
- But not numbers. Three and three?
- Six.

305
00:27:56,055 --> 00:27:59,490
You know what l'm saying?
A guy tells you it's done, right?

306
00:27:59,664 --> 00:28:03,360
But you don't know. He could be
in back doing something to somebody,

307
00:28:03,621 --> 00:28:04,882
and you don't know.

308
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,578
- Seven and seven?
- Fourteen.

309
00:28:06,752 --> 00:28:07,795
- Eight and eight?
- Sixteen.

310
00:28:08,012 --> 00:28:09,013
- Nine and nine?
- Eighteen.

311
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:13,056
Firm. Concrete.
lt's like a solid walk, understand?

312
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:15,665
That's what a lot of people
don't understand.

313
00:28:15,883 --> 00:28:19,665
They want to give you, you know...
But a number's right there.

314
00:28:19,926 --> 00:28:23,709
- You can see it, right?
- You can't buy trust, right?

315
00:28:23,926 --> 00:28:25,882
l trust my mother sometimes.

316
00:28:53,492 --> 00:28:55,318
Hey! Hey!

317
00:28:55,536 --> 00:28:57,187
Hey, l'm walking here.

318
00:28:57,405 --> 00:28:59,840
l was walking. Fuck your mother!

319
00:29:00,057 --> 00:29:01,144
Your mother!

320
00:29:11,231 --> 00:29:12,579
Whoa! Whoa!

321
00:29:12,797 --> 00:29:16,275
Money, back it on up.
No midgets getting in tonight.

322
00:29:16,493 --> 00:29:19,493
l'm sorry.
You know my name is Giant.

323
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:23,102
- Every night we go over this.
- All right then, no giants allowed.

324
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:26,579
Come off the giant tip.
You're not a giant.

325
00:29:26,797 --> 00:29:30,580
- Go home and take a nap.
- When are you gonna let the people in?

326
00:29:30,797 --> 00:29:33,841
Lines are good for business,
which you know nothing about.

327
00:29:34,058 --> 00:29:37,971
- ls that Moe and Josh talking?
- Black men can't have a smart thought?

328
00:29:38,188 --> 00:29:41,276
- No, because you're stupid.
- Why is it always the white man?

329
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:42,754
The black man is God.

330
00:29:42,971 --> 00:29:45,711
l'm sick and tired
of your Five Percenter malarkey.

331
00:29:45,929 --> 00:29:48,232
lt's not Five Percenter.
lt's Five Percent.

332
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,711
Five percent of what?

333
00:29:49,928 --> 00:29:52,711
Five percent of the population
knows what's going on,

334
00:29:52,929 --> 00:29:56,406
the gods of this planet, the original
Asiatic black man from Africa

335
00:29:56,624 --> 00:29:59,537
with knowledge of self,
sent here to teach the 85%

336
00:29:59,755 --> 00:30:01,581
that you're dumb, deaf, and blind.

337
00:30:01,754 --> 00:30:04,538
You're being exploited
by the devilish ten percent.

338
00:30:04,754 --> 00:30:07,233
- Don't cut my wisdom!
- You're talking garbage!

339
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:10,364
Acknowledge it! People should've
been in long time ago.

340
00:30:10,581 --> 00:30:14,233
Don't be looking at your Timex.
The people get in when l want them to.

341
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,929
- And when is that?
- Whoa, whoa!

342
00:30:17,146 --> 00:30:19,668
The time is when, God. Lounge.

343
00:30:21,494 --> 00:30:25,668
The both of you can kiss
my narrow black butt... two times.

344
00:30:25,886 --> 00:30:27,495
Twice.

345
00:30:27,711 --> 00:30:29,712
Kiss your narrow black butt two times?

346
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:34,321
What if l kick you on your flat back
once and watch you grow a butt?

347
00:30:34,539 --> 00:30:35,538
Relax, man.

348
00:30:35,755 --> 00:30:39,756
You ain't got no butt. You just got
two legs sticking out your shoulders.

349
00:30:39,973 --> 00:30:42,538
Lounge, man. Go in peace, my brother.

350
00:30:42,755 --> 00:30:46,060
- One day you'll be righteous.
- You look like a Slim Jim in a suit.

351
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:47,626
Lounge, man.

352
00:30:47,842 --> 00:30:50,973
That's what the devil wants,
us fighting each other.

353
00:30:51,191 --> 00:30:53,364
- Where's Left?
- Late again.

354
00:30:54,495 --> 00:30:58,495
- B, every day it's like this.
- Yeah, l know, l warned him.

355
00:30:58,712 --> 00:31:01,452
- We have to talk to this guy.
- l talked to him earlier.

356
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:03,799
- When?
- l'll bet he's with Jeanne.

357
00:31:04,017 --> 00:31:06,669
That's a sucker's bet.

358
00:31:12,017 --> 00:31:15,408
- Take off, shit.
- Sorry l'm late.

359
00:31:15,626 --> 00:31:18,192
You cannot find cab
in New York Oity.

360
00:31:25,539 --> 00:31:27,365
Left, you're late again.

361
00:31:27,583 --> 00:31:29,583
We said we're sorry, OK?

362
00:31:33,409 --> 00:31:35,713
- All right, all right.
- OK, OK.

363
00:31:35,931 --> 00:31:37,017
What did l miss?

364
00:31:37,235 --> 00:31:40,757
<i>lf your late sorry ass would've
been here, you'd have missed nada.</i>

365
00:31:40,975 --> 00:31:44,410
- We're about to go over the numbers.
- Then l didn't miss anything.

366
00:31:44,584 --> 00:31:47,627
- Damn.
- What's the matter with that brother?

367
00:31:49,323 --> 00:31:51,801
Jeanne,
could you excuse us, please?

368
00:31:52,018 --> 00:31:54,801
Just one minute.
l'll be finished, just one minute.

369
00:31:55,019 --> 00:31:58,105
- Tighten this up up here.
- OK, OK.

370
00:31:58,801 --> 00:32:02,584
- Could you excuse us, please?
- Just a minute. l'm finishing.

371
00:32:02,802 --> 00:32:04,931
What is wrong with that brother?

372
00:32:05,932 --> 00:32:08,540
Left, get her the fuck out of here!
Let's go!

373
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:12,106
Jeanne.

374
00:32:14,758 --> 00:32:16,498
l'm going to be down front.

375
00:32:20,888 --> 00:32:23,106
English. Speak English.

376
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,671
Bullshit accent. She's from Queens.

377
00:32:26,889 --> 00:32:30,758
The wrong key, Left. The wrong key
bringing your lady in here.

378
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:33,671
- Let it go.
- Why are you so hard on my lady?

379
00:32:33,889 --> 00:32:34,889
Why?

380
00:32:35,106 --> 00:32:36,933
Your lady's been fucking up.

381
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:40,498
Nobody's allowed back here,
especially when we're about to hit.

382
00:32:40,715 --> 00:32:43,629
Everybody else's woman
respects that shit except her.

383
00:32:43,845 --> 00:32:46,629
- No, no. lt's because she's white.
- Cos she's white?

384
00:32:46,802 --> 00:32:47,803
- Yes.
- Come on.

385
00:32:48,019 --> 00:32:49,932
That's why you all dog her.

386
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:53,367
- Get a grip, Left.
- You remind me of my brother.

387
00:32:53,585 --> 00:32:55,716
He was an Archie comic book freak.

388
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:57,629
That's where all his money went.

389
00:32:57,846 --> 00:33:00,976
- Yeah, he looks like Jughead.
- ls this a long story?

390
00:33:01,194 --> 00:33:02,759
Shut up and listen.

391
00:33:02,977 --> 00:33:06,151
They had these pinups
of Betty and Veronica in a bathing suit.

392
00:33:06,368 --> 00:33:09,890
One day, he tore them out,
Scotch taped them to the wall.

393
00:33:10,063 --> 00:33:12,238
- And?
- And my moms walked in.

394
00:33:12,455 --> 00:33:15,020
She saw red.
l knew there was going to be trouble.

395
00:33:15,194 --> 00:33:17,586
l said, ''Mommy, get Larry,
it was his idea.''

396
00:33:17,803 --> 00:33:21,151
''lf l ever...'' Whack. ''...see any
white women...'' Whack, whack.

397
00:33:21,325 --> 00:33:24,412
''...on my walls again, in my house,
l'll kill you.''

398
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:28,586
l started to cry, ''Mommy,
don't kill him. That's my only brother.''

399
00:33:28,804 --> 00:33:32,151
- ''He loves Betty and Veronica.''
- And the moral of the story is?

400
00:33:33,282 --> 00:33:38,065
There is no moral to the story. Keep
that croosant-eating heifer out of here.

401
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:43,239
lt's croissant. And show some respect.
Don't disrespect her like that.

402
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:45,500
She's good to me,
so have some respect.

403
00:33:45,717 --> 00:33:49,065
- You show some respect.
- Respect the dressing room.

404
00:33:49,282 --> 00:33:52,282
- Yeah, man, respect yourself.
- Do right, Left.

405
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,326
- You're jealous.
- Jealous?

406
00:33:54,543 --> 00:33:57,369
Couldn't pull a French girl.
She's an educated woman.

407
00:33:57,587 --> 00:34:00,239
She went to the Sorbonne.
You don't know where it is.

408
00:34:00,456 --> 00:34:02,978
- Sore buns?
- You can get it on 125th Street.

409
00:34:05,761 --> 00:34:07,109
She's a sister, you know.

410
00:34:07,326 --> 00:34:12,413
- Oh! She's a sister?
- Sister? What kind of sister?

411
00:34:12,631 --> 00:34:16,413
- She's a nun.
- She's Joan of Arc's sister.

412
00:34:16,631 --> 00:34:20,457
- lgnorant. You're ignorant black men.
- l got a Chinese girl.

413
00:34:20,674 --> 00:34:23,848
- She can cook, too.
- You guys are justjealous.

414
00:34:24,066 --> 00:34:25,065
Jealous?

415
00:34:25,283 --> 00:34:28,240
Do l talk about your women?
The women up on that wall?

416
00:34:28,457 --> 00:34:30,501
Them women over there?

417
00:34:30,718 --> 00:34:32,674
That's a sister.

418
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:38,284
And they go on a wall, right?
This is my sister right here.

419
00:34:38,501 --> 00:34:41,935
Here, man, a real woman.
You make a choice.

420
00:34:44,762 --> 00:34:47,675
That's cold. That's cold.

421
00:34:49,632 --> 00:34:52,240
Don't be throwing the sisters around.

422
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:55,066
You guys are absolutely disgusting.

423
00:34:55,284 --> 00:34:57,067
Take that shit off my mirror!

424
00:34:57,284 --> 00:34:59,979
- Respect the black woman.
- No, you respect my space.

425
00:35:00,197 --> 00:35:02,631
- This is the queen.
- This is my space.

426
00:35:02,849 --> 00:35:04,632
You take the queen.

427
00:35:04,849 --> 00:35:08,023
The bottom line is you were late.
You brought your lady in here.

428
00:35:08,241 --> 00:35:11,458
Don't do that anymore.
Everybody knows the rules.

429
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:13,415
Left, you're fucking up.

430
00:35:17,372 --> 00:35:19,676
Ladies and gentlemen,

431
00:35:19,894 --> 00:35:23,024
Moe and Josh Flatbush
and Beneath The Underdog

432
00:35:23,241 --> 00:35:26,546
proudly present
for your listening enjoyment

433
00:35:26,763 --> 00:35:29,937
the Bleek Quintet.

434
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,154
Thank you.

435
00:35:46,328 --> 00:35:47,329
Thank you.

436
00:35:47,546 --> 00:35:48,850
Did you see them lines?

437
00:35:49,068 --> 00:35:50,720
- We got eyes.
- We got ears.

438
00:35:50,937 --> 00:35:53,154
Bleek has consistently packed the joint.

439
00:35:53,372 --> 00:35:55,633
- We're pleased.
- We're more than pleased.

440
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:57,372
- We're ecstatic.
- Fabulous.

441
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:01,155
We want more money. You're making
a killing. What's fair is fair.

442
00:36:01,372 --> 00:36:03,633
No. What we're
paying you now is fair,

443
00:36:03,851 --> 00:36:06,068
and it's what you agreed upon.

444
00:36:06,242 --> 00:36:09,069
You want to take food
out of our kids' mouths?

445
00:36:09,243 --> 00:36:12,111
- lf we had it, we'd give it to you.
- But we don't have it.

446
00:36:12,329 --> 00:36:15,372
- Ever heard of the word renegotiate?
- Out of the question.

447
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:20,764
$15 cover charge, three-drink minimum,
dinner starts at $25.

448
00:36:20,982 --> 00:36:23,547
You guys are making money
hand over fingers.

449
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:26,895
- What about the artist?
- Don't hand me that artist doo-doo.

450
00:36:27,113 --> 00:36:31,852
They don't have any financial risks.
Go listen to the music, huh?

451
00:36:32,068 --> 00:36:34,764
- You think Bleek's Elvis?
- There's only one Elvis.

452
00:36:34,982 --> 00:36:38,417
- There's only one king in music.
- And that starts with an ''E''.

453
00:36:38,634 --> 00:36:41,634
Oome on. Go shoot some hoops.
Gimme some moves, huh?

454
00:36:41,808 --> 00:36:43,809
Let me eat my sushi.

455
00:36:53,547 --> 00:36:55,243
Black queen.

456
00:36:55,461 --> 00:36:59,504
l mean, my slice of pie.
The apple of my eye.

457
00:36:59,722 --> 00:37:02,287
My chicken thigh, extra spicy.

458
00:37:02,504 --> 00:37:03,852
Ham, Spam.

459
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:07,374
Eggs and bacon, chicken and waffles.
From Wilsons.

460
00:37:07,591 --> 00:37:10,026
How you doing, baby?
You're looking good to me.

461
00:37:10,243 --> 00:37:12,853
- What happened to you, Bleek?
- What happened to me?

462
00:37:13,069 --> 00:37:16,331
- l've been waiting for twenty years.
- Twenty...

463
00:37:16,548 --> 00:37:20,896
My watch must be going slow,
lt says 15 years, but l'll get it fixed.

464
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:25,809
Baby, you should have been
down the club. We was kicking butt.

465
00:37:26,027 --> 00:37:29,549
- Good. l'm glad it went well.
- l wish you were there.

466
00:37:29,723 --> 00:37:33,332
- You know how l feel about clubs.
- No. How do you feel?

467
00:37:33,549 --> 00:37:35,287
All that smoke!

468
00:37:35,505 --> 00:37:38,854
l'd rather sit at home
and listen to your records.

469
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:42,592
l mean, bothering with all them people,
it's not my thing.

470
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:45,201
- What are you talking about?
- What do you mean?

471
00:37:45,419 --> 00:37:47,984
- What are you saying?
- What am l saying?

472
00:37:48,201 --> 00:37:52,462
Be specific? What am l saying?
l'm saying that l love your music,

473
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,245
but l don't like
sitting up in some club.

474
00:37:55,462 --> 00:37:58,549
That's all you're saying?
You're not upset cos l'm late?

475
00:37:58,767 --> 00:38:01,723
- No. That's something different.
- l see.

476
00:38:01,941 --> 00:38:04,941
Shall we go upstairs?
Want to talk about it upstairs?

477
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:08,463
- We might, could.
- We might, could? Oh!

478
00:38:08,681 --> 00:38:11,375
- Now. l'm not waiting anymore.
- We might, could.

479
00:38:11,549 --> 00:38:16,288
l used to coulda, woulda, shoulda.
That sounds like a good song.

480
00:38:18,028 --> 00:38:21,506
What would you do, Bleek,
if you couldn't play anymore?

481
00:38:25,419 --> 00:38:27,941
Probably roll up in a corner and die.

482
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:32,159
l'd play at my own funeral, though.

483
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:46,289
l want to bite your neck.

484
00:38:46,507 --> 00:38:47,637
No!

485
00:38:47,855 --> 00:38:49,203
The other side.

486
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,681
- No!
- The other side.

487
00:38:51,899 --> 00:38:53,856
The middle.

488
00:38:54,072 --> 00:38:55,072
The lips.

489
00:38:55,246 --> 00:38:59,116
Yes, the lips.

490
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:01,855
There's more blood in the lips.

491
00:39:02,725 --> 00:39:04,768
- Don't be afraid.
- No!

492
00:39:27,116 --> 00:39:29,465
- Giant.
- Son of a bitch.

493
00:39:29,682 --> 00:39:31,639
Giant.

494
00:39:32,247 --> 00:39:35,508
Seen the paper?

495
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:38,552
l can read.

496
00:39:38,769 --> 00:39:40,944
Can you count?
Cos you owe me.

497
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:44,421
- You know l'm good for it.
- You're way over as it is.

498
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:48,074
- Are you going to carry me or what?
- You're going to give me a hernia.

499
00:39:48,291 --> 00:39:50,248
My man, l feel good about this one.

500
00:39:51,726 --> 00:39:53,378
- Shoot.
- Come on, let's go.

501
00:39:53,596 --> 00:39:58,857
Mets, Oards, Astros, Phillies, Dodgers
and the Padres.

502
00:40:02,379 --> 00:40:04,640
The full menu. How much?

503
00:40:04,857 --> 00:40:06,727
500 on each game.

504
00:40:06,944 --> 00:40:09,857
You're grown up. You're a big boy.

505
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:14,031
- That's what they say.
- l swear on my mother...

506
00:40:16,335 --> 00:40:19,031
<i>No mas. No more. No mas.</i>

507
00:40:20,466 --> 00:40:21,466
Roberto Duran.

508
00:40:21,683 --> 00:40:28,118
<i>Roberto, si.
Giant, no mas. No more. No mas.</i>

509
00:40:30,423 --> 00:40:34,075
l talked to Moe and Josh.
We're going to get our money.

510
00:40:34,293 --> 00:40:37,205
-  l'm working hard.
- Stay on top of that.

511
00:40:37,423 --> 00:40:41,032
Look, why don't you
run this to Shadow's crib?

512
00:40:41,249 --> 00:40:44,119
lt's a serious piece. l borrowed it.

513
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:46,901
He'll get it.

514
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,988
lt's about time.

515
00:40:49,206 --> 00:40:53,467
Bleek borrowed this a year ago.
This is a rare, out-of-print Bird.

516
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:57,684
Just stand there, brother. Better not
be no scratches on here, either.

517
00:41:00,206 --> 00:41:01,336
Lucky.

518
00:41:01,554 --> 00:41:05,075
Tell your bitch don't ask for nothing
if it takes a year to return it.

519
00:41:05,293 --> 00:41:07,206
l don't want to hear that bitch stuff.

520
00:41:07,424 --> 00:41:10,815
Look, l'm a delivery man.
Any static, take it up with Bleek.

521
00:41:11,032 --> 00:41:12,511
l'm spacing.

522
00:41:12,728 --> 00:41:15,510
No, no, no, hold on.

523
00:41:15,685 --> 00:41:19,554
- Er... l need your help.
- How long is it going to take?

524
00:41:19,772 --> 00:41:21,206
Hey, no time.

525
00:41:21,424 --> 00:41:24,076
- Should l change the sheets?
- They need changing.

526
00:41:24,293 --> 00:41:27,555
No, see,
l was blending this honey in here.

527
00:41:27,772 --> 00:41:31,207
So l don't want my lady to catch me.

528
00:41:31,425 --> 00:41:34,468
- You smell perfume, man?
- Shadow, you've lost your mind.

529
00:41:34,686 --> 00:41:36,076
No, do you smell perfume?

530
00:41:37,381 --> 00:41:39,034
No.

531
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:41,207
Smell the sheets, man!

532
00:41:42,469 --> 00:41:44,381
Smells all right to me.

533
00:41:46,034 --> 00:41:49,425
l don't know why
l'm asking you anyway, man.

534
00:41:49,642 --> 00:41:51,816
She has a highly developed
sense of smell.

535
00:41:52,033 --> 00:41:53,990
She could sniff me out five miles away.

536
00:41:54,208 --> 00:41:57,034
l think she must be
part canine and shit.

537
00:41:58,686 --> 00:42:01,468
Yo, you know what?
She counts my rubbers, man.

538
00:42:01,643 --> 00:42:02,642
- No.
- Yes.

539
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:05,208
The woman was an accountant major
in school.

540
00:42:05,426 --> 00:42:07,729
So she takes an accurate account
of my jimmys.

541
00:42:07,947 --> 00:42:12,252
Now l got to go buy a whole nother box
so she won't bust me again.

542
00:42:13,686 --> 00:42:15,599
One time l rid around the city, man,

543
00:42:15,817 --> 00:42:21,339
and l searched for a box
of 12 dozen blue Trojans, ribbed,

544
00:42:21,556 --> 00:42:26,643
with the receptacle end, lubricated
with the garden-fresh scent.

545
00:42:28,035 --> 00:42:30,208
Daggone girl knows everything.

546
00:42:35,295 --> 00:42:37,600
Why bother?

547
00:42:37,817 --> 00:42:39,600
Why bother?

548
00:42:39,817 --> 00:42:43,296
Well, l like her, number one.

549
00:42:43,513 --> 00:42:46,992
Number two...
she's a mother in bed.

550
00:42:47,209 --> 00:42:51,470
- Mm-hm.
- Number three, the rest don't matter.

551
00:42:51,687 --> 00:42:52,730
Three good reasons.

552
00:42:54,036 --> 00:42:55,209
Roll over.

553
00:42:55,426 --> 00:42:57,339
- Yes, baby.
- No, the other way.

554
00:42:57,557 --> 00:42:59,861
Yes,... baby.

555
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:12,992
- Ow! Baby.
- That was a good one.

556
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:15,036
- Damn, that hurt.
- Be still.

557
00:43:15,253 --> 00:43:17,992
All right. Be careful.

558
00:43:18,209 --> 00:43:22,340
- How are your singing lessons?
- Good. l think l'm ready.

559
00:43:23,254 --> 00:43:24,775
You think you're ready?

560
00:43:24,949 --> 00:43:29,036
Ready to accompany the band
for a song at the Dog.

561
00:43:30,036 --> 00:43:31,993
You think l'm not ready?

562
00:43:33,123 --> 00:43:35,384
Wait, look, baby, erm...

563
00:43:35,602 --> 00:43:39,297
just cos we're seeing each other
it's nothing to do with the music.

564
00:43:39,515 --> 00:43:41,689
Now, l think that...

565
00:43:41,905 --> 00:43:44,906
l think you got potential,
but it takes years, not months.

566
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:47,906
- Thanks for nothing.
- l'm not trying to be cruel.

567
00:43:48,124 --> 00:43:50,645
lf we were married,
l'd say the same thing.

568
00:43:50,862 --> 00:43:51,863
- Look...
- Ow!

569
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:56,124
l'm not asking you
or anybody else for any handouts.

570
00:43:56,341 --> 00:43:59,384
Everybody needs a break.
l thought you might be the person.

571
00:43:59,602 --> 00:44:03,428
Shoot me, l was wrong.
Pop your own bumps.

572
00:44:07,994 --> 00:44:10,428
You know, a lot of people
say l'm a good singer.

573
00:44:10,646 --> 00:44:13,385
Good. Go sing with them.

574
00:44:13,602 --> 00:44:15,776
Forget you. l believe in myself.

575
00:44:15,994 --> 00:44:18,690
You're supposed to believe in yourself.

576
00:44:18,907 --> 00:44:22,950
- Shadow says l can sing.
- Oh, ''Shadow says l can sing.''

577
00:44:23,124 --> 00:44:25,168
What else does Shadow say?

578
00:44:52,429 --> 00:44:53,690
A-minor seventh.

579
00:44:54,299 --> 00:44:56,647
A-minor seventh. That'll work.

580
00:45:01,255 --> 00:45:02,256
Seventh.

581
00:45:04,604 --> 00:45:06,561
B13# eleven.

582
00:45:08,169 --> 00:45:10,300
No, that's not right.

583
00:45:27,169 --> 00:45:29,169
- Does it tickle?
- Yeah.

584
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:37,343
- That's not right.
- Let me leave the artist at work alone.

585
00:45:37,561 --> 00:45:41,301
The muse is visiting him.
Bleek is truly inspired.

586
00:45:41,517 --> 00:45:45,301
Then he will share
his new, latest gift to the world.

587
00:45:45,475 --> 00:45:47,518
- Hallelujah.

588
00:46:02,649 --> 00:46:05,910
Please, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

589
00:46:06,127 --> 00:46:09,866
this is something
that came in last night.

590
00:46:10,084 --> 00:46:13,388
- Shadow. Bottom.
- l had my hand on the panties.

591
00:46:13,605 --> 00:46:15,388
On the panties.

592
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:18,344
Drums, drums. Jones.

593
00:46:18,562 --> 00:46:22,388
''Pop, Top 40, R&B,
Urban Contemporary,

594
00:46:22,606 --> 00:46:25,388
Easy Listening, Funk Love.''

595
00:46:25,606 --> 00:46:27,345
Damn, you for real?

596
00:46:27,562 --> 00:46:29,519
This shit is out.

597
00:46:36,128 --> 00:46:39,737
Now, hold up.
Let's talk about the money.

598
00:46:39,954 --> 00:46:41,867
What about the money, Shadow?

599
00:46:42,084 --> 00:46:44,302
What about the money?!

600
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:48,736
- We want more.
- You're the spokesperson for everyone?

601
00:46:48,954 --> 00:46:49,954
Yeah.

602
00:46:50,172 --> 00:46:52,868
Even for Left Hand, who's late again?

603
00:46:53,084 --> 00:46:57,519
Look, the point of the matter is we've
been packing them in at the Dog, right?

604
00:46:57,737 --> 00:47:02,868
Moe, Josh and Bleek
have been bringing in cash dollars.

605
00:47:03,085 --> 00:47:06,607
- Where's our raise?
- You promised.

606
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,781
lt's long overdue.

607
00:47:09,476 --> 00:47:12,737
- l'm talking to them.
- He's working on it.

608
00:47:15,563 --> 00:47:18,216
Yeah, well,
maybe we need new management,

609
00:47:18,433 --> 00:47:21,129
somebody who can get
the terms we want.

610
00:47:21,347 --> 00:47:23,346
You need to get your ears cleaned.

611
00:47:23,564 --> 00:47:25,563
You don't understand.
This is my band.

612
00:47:25,781 --> 00:47:29,912
Read the marquee. lt says the Bleek,
two ''E''s, one ''K'', Quintet.

613
00:47:30,129 --> 00:47:33,346
When you're running things,
you can do whatever you want.

614
00:47:33,564 --> 00:47:35,217
lt won't be long from now.

615
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:38,652
lt won't be long, but until
that magical, mystical day happens,

616
00:47:38,868 --> 00:47:40,825
you do what the hell l say.

617
00:47:42,303 --> 00:47:44,260
The midget should go, Bleek.

618
00:47:44,478 --> 00:47:46,433
Fine. You manage then.

619
00:47:47,695 --> 00:47:51,825
That's not my job. You're supposed to be
taking care of me.

620
00:47:52,043 --> 00:47:55,043
l'm the artist, midget rat bastard.

621
00:47:58,825 --> 00:48:00,826
What does size have to do with it?

622
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,087
A lot.

623
00:48:04,304 --> 00:48:06,782
You keep coming up short.

624
00:48:09,174 --> 00:48:12,478
- Don't shove me.
- Keep coming up short.

625
00:48:15,695 --> 00:48:17,870
Sorry l'm late.

626
00:48:18,087 --> 00:48:21,608
One more time, you're about 2.2 seconds
from the unemployment line.

627
00:48:21,826 --> 00:48:23,739
l'm sorry. l won't be late again.

628
00:48:23,957 --> 00:48:26,435
A lot of piano players
want your gig, a lot.

629
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:29,956
Sorry. New tune.

630
00:48:30,174 --> 00:48:32,131
lt's a nice title.

631
00:48:35,566 --> 00:48:38,348
All right, let's walk through this.

632
00:48:44,348 --> 00:48:46,957
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

633
00:48:47,175 --> 00:48:51,957
as l travel through this great big
country of ours, this US of A,

634
00:48:52,174 --> 00:48:56,566
and being on the road as much as l do,
l listen to a lot of radio stations.

635
00:48:56,784 --> 00:49:00,958
lt's amazing how many KlSS
or V103 stations there are.

636
00:49:01,175 --> 00:49:04,523
Jesus Christ, did people
run out of call letters, or what?

637
00:49:05,393 --> 00:49:07,088
Come on.

638
00:49:07,306 --> 00:49:11,480
Anyway, most of the stuff
on the radio is so sad. lt's a drag.

639
00:49:11,697 --> 00:49:14,871
One of the reasons could be
because every song is about...

640
00:49:15,089 --> 00:49:18,175
Oh, you guessed it, huh? Love.

641
00:49:18,393 --> 00:49:19,653
Love.

642
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:21,262
Love.

643
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:24,045
L-O-V-E.

644
00:49:24,306 --> 00:49:28,697
<i>What the world needs now...</i>

645
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,436
is not another love song.

646
00:49:34,523 --> 00:49:36,480
Now, dig. Check this out.

647
00:49:36,654 --> 00:49:40,437
The love that's professed in these songs
is shaky anyway.

648
00:49:40,611 --> 00:49:44,350
lt's a lustful, selfish,
end-of-the-world love.

649
00:49:44,567 --> 00:49:46,002
And the lyrics...

650
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:48,959
Have you tried to listen to the lyrics?

651
00:49:49,176 --> 00:49:51,176
You heard them all before.

652
00:49:57,654 --> 00:49:59,699
<i>My love ls hlgher
Flre and deslre</i>

653
00:49:59,915 --> 00:50:01,786
<i>Let's stay together forever</i>

654
00:50:02,002 --> 00:50:03,785
<i>Desplte all types of weather</i>

655
00:50:04,003 --> 00:50:05,568
<i>Even a hurrlcane</i>

656
00:50:05,786 --> 00:50:09,046
<i>ln fact,
l'd spend a wlnter ln Chl town</i>

657
00:50:11,612 --> 00:50:13,177
<i>And you know that's cold</i>

658
00:50:13,394 --> 00:50:15,786
<i>Aln't no mountaln hlgh enough
Aln't no rlver wlde enough</i>

659
00:50:16,003 --> 00:50:18,133
<i>To keep me from gettln'
to your good stuff</i>

660
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:19,525
<i>You know lt's rough</i>

661
00:50:30,438 --> 00:50:32,743
Racist?

662
00:50:32,959 --> 00:50:34,960
Giant's not a racist.

663
00:50:35,178 --> 00:50:36,656
Giant ain't no racist.

664
00:50:36,873 --> 00:50:38,481
<i>What a dope

665

<i>L-O-V-E</i>

700
00:53:23,268 --> 00:53:25,225
- Hi, beautiful.
- Hey, babe.

701
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:31,225
<i>- Peace.
- Assalamu alalkum, brother.</i>

702
00:53:35,704 --> 00:53:38,530
l said, ''l'm going to kill you.''
l was going to kill him.

703
00:53:38,747 --> 00:53:41,965
l had him up right against...
Bleeky, hey.

704
00:53:42,182 --> 00:53:46,182
Sit down. We've been meaning
to talk to you. Join us.

705
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,095
- Our meat-and-potatoes man.
- Bread and butter.

706
00:53:49,312 --> 00:53:52,139
- l'm not talking corned beef.
- Prime ribs.

707
00:53:52,356 --> 00:53:54,922
- You want a cigar?
- l don't want a cigar.

708
00:53:55,138 --> 00:53:57,357
l don't want
any meat and potatoes, either.

709
00:53:57,574 --> 00:54:01,574
l want more money. l'm not happy.
When l'm not happy, l don't play good.

710
00:54:01,791 --> 00:54:04,704
When l don't play good,
the music doesn't sound good.

711
00:54:04,922 --> 00:54:09,705
lf the music doesn't sound good,
nobody comes. We all lose our money.

712
00:54:09,922 --> 00:54:12,313
We want you to be happy.
You're a great talent.

713
00:54:12,487 --> 00:54:16,140
But you got a lot of dead weight
around your neck dragging you down.

714
00:54:16,357 --> 00:54:21,009
And this so-called manager of yours,
Giant, that's a joke.

715
00:54:21,226 --> 00:54:23,357
He couldn't manage a Little League team.

716
00:54:23,575 --> 00:54:26,575
When you're ready for
some real management, come see us.

717
00:54:26,748 --> 00:54:28,835
My first cousin, he's top shelf.

718
00:54:29,053 --> 00:54:32,400
- He's short, but he's smart.
- We love the guy.

719
00:54:32,618 --> 00:54:36,662
He handles only the best, first class
all the way, just like Josh and me.

720
00:54:36,879 --> 00:54:39,706
- Filet mignon.
- Dom Perignon. First class.

721
00:54:39,923 --> 00:54:43,662
l'm here to talk
about the great sums of money

722
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:47,618
that you two are making off my music
and the little l see in return.

723
00:54:47,836 --> 00:54:50,488
You're talking about management.

724
00:54:50,706 --> 00:54:55,358
Giant, your manager, negotiated
this deal, the one you agreed to.

725
00:54:55,575 --> 00:55:00,923
lt's always been our business policy
to never, ever renegotiate the deal.

726
00:55:02,836 --> 00:55:05,141
Look, Giant is my friend, OK?

727
00:55:05,358 --> 00:55:07,445
We all need close friends.

728
00:55:07,663 --> 00:55:09,575
But this is business.

729
00:55:09,793 --> 00:55:12,750
l trust him, which is more
than l can say for your cousin...

730
00:55:12,967 --> 00:55:16,097
Nobody can be trusted.

731
00:55:16,315 --> 00:55:18,750
Everyone steals. Everyone is crooked.

732
00:55:18,967 --> 00:55:21,923
You walk out with as much
of your shirt on as possible.

733
00:55:22,141 --> 00:55:24,881
- You know what this sounds like?
- We like you.

734
00:55:25,098 --> 00:55:29,055
- That's a good thing.
- We have a binding contract.

735
00:55:29,272 --> 00:55:32,489
This is real life.
Think about what we said.

736
00:55:32,707 --> 00:55:36,402
- l been thinking about it.
- Sometimes you got to expand.

737
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:38,924
To a bigger club? Dizzy's maybe?

738
00:55:39,142 --> 00:55:41,055
You have one of these?

739
00:55:41,273 --> 00:55:44,794
lf you break that, l'll sue your ass,
and you'll be out a lot of money.

740
00:55:45,011 --> 00:55:48,403
Get the fuck out of here.
That was a joke, but l would sue you.

741
00:55:58,708 --> 00:56:03,055
They got all kind of people
in this club. l ain't going to lie.

742
00:56:03,273 --> 00:56:07,447
Look at that little ugly guy at the bar.
Hey, fella!

743
00:56:07,665 --> 00:56:10,491
That's Bleek Gilliam's manager.

744
00:56:10,707 --> 00:56:13,534
Little Mr Magoo-looking fucker there.

745
00:56:15,708 --> 00:56:19,012
You think l didn't see you
back over there.

746
00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:24,361
Trying to sneak in here in the coloured
section. l see you sitting at the bar.

747
00:56:24,577 --> 00:56:27,534
Yeah, that poor fucker.

748
00:56:27,752 --> 00:56:31,795
l first met him trying out
for the Oeltics a couple of years ago.

749
00:56:32,012 --> 00:56:34,273
He got mad cos Robert Parish
was on the team.

750
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:37,926
That Larry Bird told me. He ain't
got nothing but a three-pointer.

751
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:40,491
That's all he needs.

752
00:56:42,578 --> 00:56:45,361
Man walked in the doctor's office
just stuttering.

753
00:56:45,578 --> 00:56:48,926
''Doc, g-g-got to help me.
My wife says she's going to leave me.''

754
00:56:49,143 --> 00:56:52,535
''l-l-l'm stuttering l-l-l-like a goof.''

755
00:56:52,752 --> 00:56:56,448
Doc says, ''Damn, l can barely stand
to hear you talk myself.''

756
00:56:56,665 --> 00:56:59,492
''Go in the examination room
and pull off your clothes.''

757
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:02,057
''Let me see what's wrong with you.''

758
00:57:02,274 --> 00:57:05,753
The doctor went in the examination room,
looks between his legs,

759
00:57:05,969 --> 00:57:09,057
says, ''My God.
No wonder you can't talk.''

760
00:57:09,274 --> 00:57:12,579
''All that is pulling
on your vocal cords.''

761
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:16,970
''Put some of that on the table.
Let me chop it off for you.''

762
00:57:17,187 --> 00:57:19,927
The doc went whack.
He says, ''Speak.''

763
00:57:20,144 --> 00:57:22,883
''Thank you, Doctor.''

764
00:57:23,101 --> 00:57:26,014
''My wife is going to love me.
l sure appreciate this.''

765
00:57:26,232 --> 00:57:29,927
Doc said, ''Damn, l'd appreciate it, too,
if you'd pay the bill.''

766
00:57:30,144 --> 00:57:34,927
''Come back in a couple of weeks.
Let me see how you're doing.''

767
00:57:35,145 --> 00:57:37,144
lndigo, does Bleek know you're here?

768
00:57:37,362 --> 00:57:41,710
- No. He has no idea.
- Are you sure?

769
00:57:41,927 --> 00:57:44,580
l'm just gonna make sure.

770
00:57:44,797 --> 00:57:46,754
Little while.

771
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:54,579
- What you listening to, man?
- What?

772
00:57:54,797 --> 00:57:57,405
- This is my brother's tape.
- Bleek.

773
00:57:57,623 --> 00:58:01,319
- This stuff is sad, man.
- Can l see you for a second?

774
00:58:03,145 --> 00:58:05,102
He's playing all the instruments.

775
00:58:08,145 --> 00:58:09,406
What's up?

776
00:58:09,624 --> 00:58:11,884
lndigo and Olarke just walked in.

777
00:58:12,102 --> 00:58:15,319
- Yeah? All right, bet.
- Remember that bet?

778
00:58:15,537 --> 00:58:17,494
- What bet?
- We were in Paris.

779
00:58:17,711 --> 00:58:21,494
l urged you not to buy them
the same dress.

780
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:23,885
You said it was a million-to-one shot

781
00:58:24,102 --> 00:58:28,928
they wear the same dress on the same day
and see each other.

782
00:58:30,581 --> 00:58:35,103
Want to bet again?
You owe me fiddy dollars. Fiddy.

783
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:37,363
Yeah. Yeah, that's er...

784
00:58:38,842 --> 00:58:41,320
That's good looking-out, G-man.

785
00:58:41,537 --> 00:58:45,581
That's what good managers are for.

786
00:58:45,799 --> 00:58:49,885
- What are you going to do?
- Er...

787
00:58:50,103 --> 00:58:53,320
- What? l'm going to handle this.
- This is a rough one.

788
00:58:53,538 --> 00:58:56,320
- l got it.
- The roughest of the roughest.

789
00:58:56,494 --> 00:58:59,712
- Watch me work.
- l'll be watching.

790
00:58:59,929 --> 00:59:01,495
l'll watch this one.

791
00:59:01,712 --> 00:59:05,625
How you doing, waitress?
She's a nun.

792
00:59:05,842 --> 00:59:08,408
Won't give me none, ain't had none,

793
00:59:08,625 --> 00:59:10,625
told me she didn't need none.

794
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:17,756
l'm looking for a woman. l'm horny
enough to fuck the crack of dawn.

795
00:59:17,973 --> 00:59:20,278
That's right. l don't lie.

796
00:59:21,799 --> 00:59:24,799
Right. There's some
good-looking women in here

797
00:59:25,017 --> 00:59:27,408
and some good-looking fellas.

798
00:59:27,625 --> 00:59:29,582
How you doing, sir?

799
00:59:30,756 --> 00:59:34,234
l'm a trisexual.
l'll try your little ass tonight.

800
00:59:35,278 --> 00:59:37,974
- You're so nasty.
- Hey, girl, what's happening?

801
00:59:38,191 --> 00:59:40,365
- Hey, how you doing?
- Good. Enjoy.

802
00:59:40,582 --> 00:59:42,539
- Thanks.
- OK.

803
00:59:46,104 --> 00:59:50,409
My, my, my. What a pleasant surprise.

804
00:59:50,626 --> 00:59:52,583
- Hi.
- Hi.

805
00:59:54,105 --> 00:59:57,626
l been meaning to ask you something.

806
00:59:57,844 --> 01:00:00,409
- What do you see in Bleek?
- What?

807
01:00:00,626 --> 01:00:02,539
l don't know what you see in him.

808
01:00:02,713 --> 01:00:05,323
He's an all right cat, but...

809
01:00:09,583 --> 01:00:11,844
- What about you?
- What about me?

810
01:00:12,061 --> 01:00:14,062
What about your career?

811
01:00:14,279 --> 01:00:16,758
You should be upstage.

812
01:00:16,932 --> 01:00:19,279
Yeah, l agree.

813
01:00:20,279 --> 01:00:25,018
lf you can't get it here,
you better call your cousin.

814
01:00:25,236 --> 01:00:28,975
''l didn't come.''
Well, you should've called.

815
01:00:33,193 --> 01:00:39,497
l'm from Mississippi, and l love it.
l like being country. l ain't lying.

816
01:00:39,715 --> 01:00:42,367
Ain't nothing like a good country lady.

817
01:00:42,584 --> 01:00:46,150
Girl the other day, l was messing around
with her breast. She got hot.

818
01:00:46,367 --> 01:00:50,324
She said, ''Wouldn't you like something
to go with this breast milk?''

819
01:00:50,541 --> 01:00:54,019
l said, ''A good piece of cornbread
would go just fine.''

820
01:00:57,454 --> 01:00:59,932
l like being from the country.

821
01:01:01,063 --> 01:01:05,933
Ain't nothing wrong
with being from the country.

822
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:08,542
Not a damn thing wrong with it.

823
01:01:08,802 --> 01:01:11,150
Waitress knows.

824
01:01:11,368 --> 01:01:15,715
All those bad kids in her house.

825
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:21,150
Hey, baby.

826
01:01:23,802 --> 01:01:27,716
What a pleasant surprise to see you
here. l didn't expect to see you.

827
01:01:27,933 --> 01:01:30,281
A big surprise.

828
01:01:30,498 --> 01:01:32,064
Huh?

829
01:01:33,629 --> 01:01:35,542
What? How so?

830
01:01:35,759 --> 01:01:38,846
You nearly pissed in your pants
when you saw me,

831
01:01:39,064 --> 01:01:41,760
especially since you invited Olarke.

832
01:01:41,977 --> 01:01:45,064
l didn't invite Olarke.
Anyway, Shadow invited Olarke.

833
01:01:47,542 --> 01:01:51,021
You always talk about how
you don't want to come to the clubs.

834
01:01:51,238 --> 01:01:53,934
l'm just surprised to see you here.

835
01:01:55,238 --> 01:01:59,542
- l had a sudden change of heart.
- l'm... l'm... l'm happy.

836
01:02:00,673 --> 01:02:02,325
l'm happy.

837
01:02:03,804 --> 01:02:06,630
But is she happy? ls she happy?

838
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:09,760
- l'm sorry. What?
- ls she happy?

839
01:02:11,108 --> 01:02:13,151
l like her dress, Bleek.

840
01:02:14,369 --> 01:02:16,760
l love the way you sing.

841
01:02:17,021 --> 01:02:19,456
You can really sing.

842
01:02:20,544 --> 01:02:22,978
l'm starting my own band.

843
01:02:23,978 --> 01:02:25,543
Yeah.

844
01:02:25,761 --> 01:02:28,804
The Shadow Henderson Quartet,

845
01:02:29,022 --> 01:02:32,109
featuring Miss Olarke Bentancourt.

846
01:02:34,282 --> 01:02:38,718
l know you can't make
that move right now, and this is cool,

847
01:02:38,935 --> 01:02:42,630
but, Olarke,
think about what l'm saying.

848
01:02:42,848 --> 01:02:45,848
All Bleek cares about is Bleek.

849
01:02:46,978 --> 01:02:49,588
- ls that so?
- Oh, so that is.

850
01:02:49,804 --> 01:02:51,891
Just take a look around.

851
01:02:52,109 --> 01:02:55,457
lt seems to me that
all Shadow cares about is Shadow.

852
01:02:55,674 --> 01:03:00,674
Anything, anyone that overshadows him,
he blocks them, like me.

853
01:03:00,892 --> 01:03:04,936
l'm supposed to be the leader
of this motherfucker, not Bleek.

854
01:03:05,153 --> 01:03:09,110
But l'm not,
so l have to get my own thing.

855
01:03:13,196 --> 01:03:14,848
You know...

856
01:03:17,066 --> 01:03:20,675
l know you love Bleek, and that's
beautiful, black people in love.

857
01:03:20,893 --> 01:03:24,067
l'd be the last person
to come between you and him.

858
01:03:24,284 --> 01:03:27,240
But at some point,
you have to let this love shit go,

859
01:03:27,458 --> 01:03:30,545
and you have to think about respect.

860
01:03:30,763 --> 01:03:35,197
lf he doesn't respect you,
then you don't need him.

861
01:03:36,762 --> 01:03:38,284
OK?

862
01:03:39,676 --> 01:03:42,546
All l ask is that you think about
what l'm saying.

863
01:03:42,762 --> 01:03:46,458
- Yeah, l'll think about it.
- No. Think about it.

864
01:03:49,502 --> 01:03:50,762
- Promise?
- Yes.

865
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:52,893
Promise, promise?

866
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,850
l got to go. Er...

867
01:03:57,067 --> 01:03:59,676
lt's getting a little crowded over here.

868
01:04:00,632 --> 01:04:04,850
Oh, er, by the way,...
l like your dress.

869
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:07,937
lt's hot.

870
01:04:08,155 --> 01:04:10,720
You got to let them know
who the boss is.

871
01:04:29,764 --> 01:04:32,764
How you doing?
You should watch the company you keep.

872
01:04:32,981 --> 01:04:35,937
- l could say the same for you.
- But you won't.

873
01:04:37,938 --> 01:04:39,546
Erm...

874
01:04:39,764 --> 01:04:43,373
- What are you thinking about?
- Right now?

875
01:04:43,634 --> 01:04:48,199
l'm thinking about you.
She came in on her own accord.

876
01:04:48,417 --> 01:04:51,069
lt's a free country.
Want me to ask her to leave?

877
01:04:51,287 --> 01:04:56,242
- Yeah. Send her home.
- Come on, baby. l can't do that.

878
01:04:56,460 --> 01:05:00,374
The point is this.
l asked you to come. You're here.

879
01:05:00,591 --> 01:05:04,112
You're the one l'm leaving with.
That's what counts, OK?

880
01:05:04,330 --> 01:05:05,330
OK?

881
01:05:06,895 --> 01:05:08,852
l like her dress.

882
01:05:11,548 --> 01:05:13,504
Enjoy the set.

883
01:05:28,635 --> 01:05:32,591
Shadow, my man, my main man,
how you doing?

884
01:05:33,634 --> 01:05:37,592
- What's up, Bleek?
- l'm good. Everything's...

885
01:05:38,679 --> 01:05:44,636
Listen, last time l looked
at Olarke's naked body,

886
01:05:44,852 --> 01:05:47,940
l didn't see my name on it anywhere.

887
01:05:48,157 --> 01:05:51,157
l mean, l didn't see it on her...

888
01:05:51,374 --> 01:05:53,331
l didn't see it anywhere.

889
01:05:53,549 --> 01:05:57,853
So if you're trying to push up on her,
don't sweat yourself, everything's OK.

890
01:05:58,071 --> 01:06:03,331
- Nobody owns anybody.
- You're absolutely right, Bleek.

891
01:06:03,549 --> 01:06:09,375
You know, you really
should listen to Olarke sing,

892
01:06:09,592 --> 01:06:14,549
or is it that you can only hear
your own music?

893
01:08:01,335 --> 01:08:03,726
What are you doing?
lndigo, that tickles.

894
01:08:03,943 --> 01:08:07,031
Get off! What did you call me?

895
01:08:07,247 --> 01:08:09,857
- l called you your name.
- The hell you did.

896
01:08:10,074 --> 01:08:12,248
l ain't deaf! You called me lndigo.

897
01:08:12,465 --> 01:08:15,509
What? No, come on.
l didn't call you lndigo.

898
01:08:15,726 --> 01:08:19,161
- l called you your name.
- Motherfucker, you called me lndigo.

899
01:08:19,422 --> 01:08:22,335
l can't even believe
you would have the audacity

900
01:08:22,553 --> 01:08:26,335
to call me by your other woman's name.

901
01:08:26,553 --> 01:08:30,074
l ain't no fool.
l do know you have another woman.

902
01:08:30,292 --> 01:08:32,900
- l ain't going for this shit.
- What is your name?

903
01:08:33,118 --> 01:08:35,075
Get off, Bleek!

904
01:08:37,553 --> 01:08:41,032
How in the hell
can you call me by her name?

905
01:08:41,248 --> 01:08:44,335
l am in your bed, Bleek...
lndigo, not Olarke.

906
01:08:45,074 --> 01:08:48,423
- l'm Olarke, not lndigo.
- l called you Olarke.

907
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:51,162
You can practise
for eight hours straight

908
01:08:51,379 --> 01:08:54,423
and can't spend
the little bit of time it takes

909
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:57,770
to learn the difference
between me and your other woman.

910
01:08:57,988 --> 01:09:01,902
Listen to me, Bleek.
l don't like it, l don't appreciate it,

911
01:09:02,162 --> 01:09:05,075
and l don't want to be
disrespected by you!

912
01:09:05,249 --> 01:09:08,684
l've had it!
And you say that you love me?

913
01:09:08,902 --> 01:09:11,336
- l never said that.
- You did say that.

914
01:09:11,554 --> 01:09:15,467
- l don't remember it.
- Do you remember saying you care?

915
01:09:15,684 --> 01:09:17,119
Yeah, l remember that.

916
01:09:17,336 --> 01:09:21,554
lf you say you care, then why in
the fuck are you still fucking lndigo?

917
01:09:21,771 --> 01:09:24,554
Don't give me that
''lt's a dick thing'' shit, either.

918
01:09:24,771 --> 01:09:28,641
Don't give me that
''lt's a dick thing'' shit, either.

919
01:09:28,859 --> 01:09:30,206
Look at me!

920
01:09:30,423 --> 01:09:31,945
Look at me, Bleek!

921
01:09:32,163 --> 01:09:34,119
What are you looking at?

922
01:09:36,684 --> 01:09:40,467
Why can't you look at me?
That's where the real me is.

923
01:09:40,684 --> 01:09:45,206
You always avoid direct eye contact,
you know that?

924
01:09:45,424 --> 01:09:49,685
Are you afraid of something?
Are you afraid l might see the real you?

925
01:09:49,903 --> 01:09:53,206
Answer me.
Come on, answer me.

926
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:55,729
Think about that.

927
01:09:55,946 --> 01:09:57,685
Are you thinking, Bleek?

928
01:09:57,903 --> 01:09:59,685
Are you thinking?

929
01:09:59,903 --> 01:10:02,337
You don't know what to say, do you?

930
01:10:07,424 --> 01:10:11,208
There you go.
You can't face me, can you?

931
01:10:11,424 --> 01:10:14,729
Whenever you get in a jam,
you grab your trumpet.

932
01:10:17,511 --> 01:10:21,468
Let's cut the bullshit.
lf you can hang, fine. lf you can't...

933
01:10:21,685 --> 01:10:23,904
Let's not pretend anymore.

934
01:10:24,121 --> 01:10:27,469
Fine. Let's not pretend anymore!

935
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:32,817
l can't hang.

936
01:10:59,556 --> 01:11:03,035
Bleek, l want to know how many
laps you're going to do today.

937
01:11:03,252 --> 01:11:05,600
How many laps?

938
01:11:06,426 --> 01:11:08,382
You look good.

939
01:11:11,339 --> 01:11:13,295
Bleek.

940
01:11:20,644 --> 01:11:23,644
You're not talking today, huh?

941
01:11:23,861 --> 01:11:26,514
- You want to talk?
- You're quiet.

942
01:11:27,730 --> 01:11:30,644
Usually, you're running your damn mouth.

943
01:11:35,123 --> 01:11:37,079
Want to race?

944
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:45,688
Bleek!

945
01:11:45,906 --> 01:11:47,470
Come on, Bleek! Hold up!

946
01:11:47,688 --> 01:11:50,123
- Come on.
- Hold up!

947
01:11:50,819 --> 01:11:52,862
Whoo!

948
01:11:54,558 --> 01:11:56,514
You like that, huh?

949
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:04,645
- Want some water?
- Nah.

950
01:12:08,515 --> 01:12:12,124
G, you're doing a half-assed job, man.

951
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:15,384
You OK'd the deal.
You said get you the Dog, and l did.

952
01:12:15,601 --> 01:12:18,602
l got you the best terms possible
at the time.

953
01:12:18,776 --> 01:12:21,515
- You do it down the line.
- This is down the line.

954
01:12:21,732 --> 01:12:25,341
- l'm working on it.
- You're taking advantage of me.

955
01:12:25,559 --> 01:12:27,602
We grew up together.

956
01:12:27,819 --> 01:12:31,558
l'd rather chop off my left hand
than take advantage of you.

957
01:12:31,776 --> 01:12:33,733
This is about more than friendship.

958
01:12:33,950 --> 01:12:36,689
l'm breaking my friggin' neck for you.
Do l look rich?

959
01:12:36,906 --> 01:12:42,428
- Somebody's been talking to you.
- Nobody's been talking to me.

960
01:12:42,646 --> 01:12:45,690
All l'm saying is,
you got to do a betterjob.

961
01:12:45,907 --> 01:12:49,776
How many ass-whippings
have you saved me from? A lot.

962
01:12:49,994 --> 01:12:55,429
One of these days, l won't be around.
You'll have to take that ass-whipping.

963
01:12:55,646 --> 01:12:59,820
- What do you want me to say?
- l don't want you to say anything.

964
01:13:00,037 --> 01:13:02,995
- l just want you to do it.
- l'll do a betterjob.

965
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:05,603
All right, man.

966
01:13:05,821 --> 01:13:08,516
- What about that loan?
- What?

967
01:13:08,690 --> 01:13:12,994
- l need a loan.
- What about that loan?

968
01:13:13,212 --> 01:13:16,473
What did we just talk about?
Now you're going to ask for a loan?

969
01:13:16,691 --> 01:13:19,864
- Are you gambling again?
- l got it. lt's under control.

970
01:13:20,082 --> 01:13:22,343
You got it? Good.

971
01:13:23,647 --> 01:13:25,952
How much you owe?

972
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:31,082
Just a little bit.

973
01:13:37,126 --> 01:13:38,778
- Nah?
- Nah.

974
01:13:38,995 --> 01:13:40,517
- Nah.
- Nah.

975
01:13:40,734 --> 01:13:42,691
l'm spacing.

01:14:25,083 --> 01:14:26,083
- Huh?
- Yes.

988
01:14:26,301 --> 01:14:28,431
Yes only means something
when you said...

989
01:14:29,866 --> 01:14:34,823
Rod, wouldn't it be black of us to take
our brother to Brooklyn Hospital?

990
01:14:35,084 --> 01:14:37,040
Afro-American.

991
01:14:38,693 --> 01:14:41,475
Big Stop, what's taking you so long?
l'm hungry.

992
01:14:41,693 --> 01:14:45,214
Butterbean, quit fucking with me.
Get out of the kitchen.

993
01:14:45,431 --> 01:14:48,605
Big Stop Oreole, y'all couldn't cook.

994
01:14:50,867 --> 01:14:52,954
You two niggers would burn cornflakes.

995
01:14:53,171 --> 01:14:55,041
Bleek, come get this nigger.

996
01:14:56,563 --> 01:15:01,519
So you fell off a bike, huh?
l don't believe your story.

997
01:15:01,736 --> 01:15:03,475
l hit a pothole.

998
01:15:03,693 --> 01:15:06,433
And l was born yesterday,
but l stayed up all night.

999
01:15:06,649 --> 01:15:10,475
- Food's ready. Come on!
- l hit a pothole.

1000
01:15:10,693 --> 01:15:14,172
<i>Mon cherl, you can get me
a glass of wine. That's not good.</i>

1001
01:15:21,258 --> 01:15:24,041
Look at y'all. lt looks delicious.

1002
01:15:24,259 --> 01:15:25,911
Butterbean, don't do that.

1003
01:15:26,085 --> 01:15:30,433
- l'm freaky. l'll suck a wet doorknob.
- You'll suck a what?

1004
01:15:30,650 --> 01:15:33,172
You can get me a napkin.
lt's so messy.

1005
01:15:33,390 --> 01:15:35,433
<i>Oul, mon cherl. Mal Ma cherle.</i>

1006
01:15:42,389 --> 01:15:44,346
No.

1007
01:15:44,564 --> 01:15:47,868
l got to watch you,
cos you are loose.

1008
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:50,477
You're just one of them yellow gals.

1009
01:15:50,694 --> 01:15:55,043
Watch it, Butterbean.
l could slap you right in your mouth.

1010
01:15:55,259 --> 01:15:57,607
But you ain't,
cos l'll kick your ass.

1011
01:15:57,825 --> 01:16:00,390
<i>Sweatln'my gang
Whlle l'm chlllln'ln my shack</i>

1012
01:16:00,607 --> 01:16:02,520
<i>And searchln'my car for what...</i>

1013
01:16:02,738 --> 01:16:04,477
Bottom?

1014
01:16:04,695 --> 01:16:09,043
Hey, man, you already owe me
$300, home slice.

1015
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:11,086
- Branford?
- Hell, no!

1016
01:16:12,999 --> 01:16:15,781
Left Hand, l need this solid, man.

1017
01:16:15,955 --> 01:16:18,695
l wouldn't ask if l didn't need it.

1018
01:16:18,912 --> 01:16:21,130
Jeanne. Jeanne.

1019
01:16:21,347 --> 01:16:23,043
<i>Look, sllence.</i>

1020
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:28,043
You got five? Give me five.

1021
01:16:28,261 --> 01:16:30,304
Jeanne.

1022
01:16:33,434 --> 01:16:36,348
- l need to get it back.
- You'll get it back.

1023
01:16:36,565 --> 01:16:39,130
l don't appreciate
you calling me white bitch.

1024
01:16:39,347 --> 01:16:44,000
Here we are. This is our music, right?
Jazz is our music. lt's black music.

1025
01:16:44,218 --> 01:16:49,000
We will go and watch some crossover
stuff that's created by other people,

1026
01:16:49,217 --> 01:16:53,044
but we don't come to see our own, man.

1027
01:16:53,261 --> 01:16:54,565
But the jazz...

1028
01:16:54,783 --> 01:16:59,348
lf we had to depend upon on black people
to eat, we would starve to death.

1029
01:16:59,566 --> 01:17:02,392
You look out into the audience,
and what do you see?

1030
01:17:02,609 --> 01:17:05,304
You see Japanese, West Germans,

1031
01:17:05,522 --> 01:17:08,523
you see Slabovic, anything,
except our people, man.

1032
01:17:08,739 --> 01:17:10,479
lt makes no sense.

1033
01:17:10,696 --> 01:17:14,740
lt incenses me that our own people
don't realize our own heritage, culture.

1034
01:17:14,958 --> 01:17:17,914
- This is our music, man.
- That's bullshit.

1035
01:17:18,088 --> 01:17:22,697
- Why?
- Everything you just said is bullshit.

1036
01:17:22,914 --> 01:17:27,044
- Come on, man.
- Out of all the people in the world...

1037
01:17:27,262 --> 01:17:30,392
l love you like a stepbrother,
but you never gave nobody else

1038
01:17:30,610 --> 01:17:33,479
a chance to play their own music.

1039
01:17:33,697 --> 01:17:35,610
l'm talking about the audience.

1040
01:17:35,828 --> 01:17:39,175
You grandiose motherfuckers
don't play shit that they like.

1041
01:17:39,349 --> 01:17:43,132
lf you play the shit they like,
people will come.

1042
01:17:43,349 --> 01:17:46,828
- That's what l'm going to do.
- l see. l see.

1043
01:17:47,045 --> 01:17:50,871
- l'll play the shit everybody like.
- l have my own voice.

1044
01:17:51,088 --> 01:17:54,437
- People are listening.
- Everybody's deaf, brother.

1045
01:17:54,611 --> 01:17:57,219
People are listening to my voice.

1046
01:17:57,437 --> 01:17:59,785
- Ain't nobody coming.
- Nobody's coming?

1047
01:18:00,001 --> 01:18:04,480
- You just said...
- l said our people aren't coming.

1048
01:18:04,698 --> 01:18:07,698
That's what l'm talking about,
black people.

1049
01:18:07,915 --> 01:18:12,350
Keep it down.
You got customers right here.

1050
01:18:12,567 --> 01:18:17,089
Fuck them and fuck this shit.
The reality is...

1051
01:18:17,306 --> 01:18:22,177
- Why you disrespecting my house?
- l'm not disrespecting your house.

1052
01:18:22,393 --> 01:18:26,916
Shut up.
You muscle-head nigger, shut up.

1053
01:18:27,132 --> 01:18:29,872
Y'all can't play worth a goddamn.

1054
01:18:30,090 --> 01:18:33,351
- King Kong shit.
- Who you trying to talk about?

1055
01:18:33,568 --> 01:18:37,567
His head looks like a goddamn
question mark.

1056
01:18:38,699 --> 01:18:40,655
You laugh at that shit?

1057
01:18:43,481 --> 01:18:45,655
Put them lips on a trumpet,
motherfucker!

1058
01:18:45,873 --> 01:18:50,351
l know Giant. lf he's in, he'll come out
because he has to come out.

1059
01:18:50,568 --> 01:18:56,178
lf he's out, he'll come back to change
his underwear or throw the garbage out.

1060
01:18:56,394 --> 01:18:59,525
Maybe not throw the garbage,
but he's gonna come back.

1061
01:18:59,743 --> 01:19:04,395
They call him Giant
cos he's a giant pain in the ass.

1062
01:19:04,612 --> 01:19:11,134
Sooner or later,
he's either going to go in or come out.

1063
01:19:11,352 --> 01:19:15,612
l don't want no excuses.
l don't want to hear anything.

1064
01:19:15,830 --> 01:19:19,135
''Forgive me.'' No.
That won't break no more.

1065
01:19:19,351 --> 01:19:23,656
Let's give him a break.
Break his legs, his arms.

1066
01:19:23,874 --> 01:19:28,569
l give him a lot of rope, but he won't
strangle me with my own rope.

1067
01:19:30,483 --> 01:19:34,352
Sooner or later, in or out,
everybody, in or out of the house.

1068
01:19:37,613 --> 01:19:39,526
Enough.

1069
01:19:57,005 --> 01:20:00,787
- Hi, Shadow. How you doing?
- Fine, like yourself.

1070
01:20:01,005 --> 01:20:03,657
- Will this be cash or charge?
- Charge.

1071
01:20:03,875 --> 01:20:06,309
- You do take American Express?
- Yes, we do.

1072
01:20:06,527 --> 01:20:09,483
Good. Gold action.

1073
01:20:11,570 --> 01:20:15,005
- l was a member since 1989.
- That long?

1074
01:20:15,179 --> 01:20:17,875
You look hot.
That dress makes you look like a zebra.

1075
01:20:18,092 --> 01:20:21,048
l could be Tarzan.
We could play in the jungle.

1076
01:20:22,658 --> 01:20:26,179
Let me package you up
in one of these ODs,

1077
01:20:26,354 --> 01:20:31,179
put you in my pocket,
my front one, to kiss on.

1078
01:20:33,093 --> 01:20:35,136
Mm, mm-mm.

1079
01:20:36,266 --> 01:20:38,397
- Shadow?
- Olarke.

1080
01:20:38,615 --> 01:20:42,093
Your account is declined.
l have to confiscate your card.

1081
01:20:42,310 --> 01:20:46,310
- l just paid them. Call them back.
- Just look right there.

1082
01:20:50,745 --> 01:20:54,572
- lt's cool. l got those anyway.
- Then why are you here?

1083
01:20:54,833 --> 01:20:56,702
To see you.

1084
01:21:03,441 --> 01:21:05,398
All right.

1085
01:21:09,398 --> 01:21:12,572
We're gonna do something...
Let me ask y'all something.

1086
01:21:12,789 --> 01:21:15,311
How many of y'all out there
know about the blues?

1087
01:21:19,572 --> 01:21:23,659
- l know about the blues, Bleek.
- l know l do, so...

1088
01:21:25,833 --> 01:21:29,616
Well, anyway, we're going to do a tune
called Mo' Better Blues.

1089
01:24:26,099 --> 01:24:28,533
Moe and Josh want to see you.

1090
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:16,057
The blues.

1091
01:25:23,970 --> 01:25:26,926
- Don't forget my song, now.
- l'll see what l can do.

1092
01:25:28,361 --> 01:25:30,666
- Bleek.
- What you doing out here?

1093
01:25:30,883 --> 01:25:33,404
- l need a place to stay.
- For tonight?

1094
01:25:33,622 --> 01:25:35,665
- For a while.
- All right.

1095
01:25:35,839 --> 01:25:37,492
That's my brother.

1096
01:25:39,927 --> 01:25:42,623
l talked with Moe and Josh again.

1097
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:45,709
- What happened?
- Contract. We're stuck.

1098
01:25:45,926 --> 01:25:48,752
We're gonna get a new lawyer,
a real lawyer.

1099
01:25:48,970 --> 01:25:51,492
l got one, my brother-in-law Moses.

1100
01:25:51,710 --> 01:25:54,101
- Your brother-in-law Moses?
- He's cheap.

1101
01:25:54,318 --> 01:25:56,666
Wait a minute. That's out, man.

1102
01:25:56,884 --> 01:26:00,449
Your brother-in-law Moses...
What's the deal with your relatives?

1103
01:26:00,667 --> 01:26:03,928
Your uncle's a plumber,
your cousin's a dent...

1104
01:26:04,144 --> 01:26:06,884
Look at my teeth.
They're still messed up.

1105
01:26:07,101 --> 01:26:09,754
l hate to say this,
but you got a fucked-up family.

1106
01:26:09,971 --> 01:26:14,493
- Why you dogging my folks?
- l'm just tired of suppor...

1107
01:26:14,710 --> 01:26:17,101
- l'm sick of your relatives.
- They love you.

1108
01:26:17,319 --> 01:26:20,580
- They supported you from the beginning.
- l supported them.

1109
01:26:20,798 --> 01:26:25,579
l'll keep my family
out of our business matters.

1110
01:26:25,797 --> 01:26:28,754
l'm here to do your bidding.
That's my job.

1111
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:35,710
So how much you owe?

1112
01:26:35,928 --> 01:26:37,841
Afraid to say.

1113
01:26:40,580 --> 01:26:42,798
More than before.

1114
01:26:58,885 --> 01:27:04,320
Look, l'll see how much l can raise, but
you got to get help. Your gig is over.

1115
01:27:04,493 --> 01:27:10,147
l've been contemplating managing
myself anyway. l got to be in control.

1116
01:27:10,364 --> 01:27:12,451
lf that's what you want.

1117
01:27:12,668 --> 01:27:16,451
- That's what l want. You're fired.
- You're cutting everybody off.

1118
01:27:16,625 --> 01:27:22,016
Me, lndigo, Olarke. Especially me.

1119
01:27:22,233 --> 01:27:25,799
l'm not cutting anybody off.
l'm looking out for myself.

1120
01:27:26,016 --> 01:27:28,147
Besides, lndigo and Olarke cut me off.

1121
01:27:28,364 --> 01:27:30,843
That ain't what l heard.

1122
01:27:32,017 --> 01:27:34,104
How long you known me?

1123
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:37,364
- Since third grade.
- That's got to count for something.

1124
01:27:37,581 --> 01:27:41,452
lf l didn't know you since third grade,
l'd have fired you a long time ago.

1125
01:27:41,669 --> 01:27:45,147
- You're that unhappy with my work?
- l've been that unhappy.

1126
01:27:45,364 --> 01:27:48,452
That's beside the point.
The bottom line is this.

1127
01:27:48,669 --> 01:27:51,234
OK, here's the thing.

1128
01:27:54,756 --> 01:27:57,582
The offer stands as it was.
You can stay at my house.

1129
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:00,582
l'll help you get some money
before you get killed,

1130
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:04,539
but... you're going to do something
about that gambling.

1131
01:28:04,756 --> 01:28:09,060
All right, all right, all right.
l'll get it together.

1132
01:28:09,278 --> 01:28:11,235
l know l'm sick.

1133
01:28:44,105 --> 01:28:47,279
<i>Thls ls lndlgo.

<i>Please leave a message

1135
01:28:51,149 --> 01:28:55,018

This is me, Bleek. How you doing?

1144
01:30:00,585 --> 01:30:05,498
- Let me turn this off.
- No, no, no. No.

1145
01:30:05,716 --> 01:30:07,673
l want to hear this.

1146
01:30:07,890 --> 01:30:09,803
<i>l haven't seen you ln a whlle.</i>

1147
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:12,803
He's begging. Boy, that Bleek.

1148
01:30:13,021 --> 01:30:17,411
He only wants you when he wants you.
l want to make you a full-time gig.

1149
01:30:17,629 --> 01:30:20,586
l don't believe what a man says.

1150
01:30:21,629 --> 01:30:27,455
Well, in this particular instance,
in this particular case, believe me.

1151
01:30:27,673 --> 01:30:31,151
The rest of the time,
only believe half of what a man says.

1152
01:30:31,369 --> 01:30:35,891
Half is truth. The other half is bull.

1153
01:30:36,108 --> 01:30:39,108
Which half are you?

1154
01:30:41,195 --> 01:30:44,152
- Half.
- Yeah, half of what?

1155
01:30:44,369 --> 01:30:45,804
- Half.
- See?

1156
01:30:46,022 --> 01:30:50,805
- l don't believe anything y'all say.
- lt's not what l say, it's what l do.

1157
01:32:10,546 --> 01:32:13,502
- What's up?
- Where's the money?

1158
01:32:13,719 --> 01:32:16,110
- l'm working on it.
- Don't work too long.

1159
01:32:16,328 --> 01:32:18,806
ln the meanwhile,
stay out the spotlight.

1160
01:32:18,980 --> 01:32:21,980
- What are you going to do?
- ln the words of Darryl Dawkins,

1161
01:32:22,198 --> 01:32:25,936
''When all is said and done,
there's nothing left to say or do.''

1162
01:32:26,154 --> 01:32:30,110
- Whatever happened to that brother?
- He's on Lovetron.

1163
01:32:32,459 --> 01:32:36,980
B, l don't like no static.
l'm a peaceful person.

1164
01:32:37,198 --> 01:32:40,111
And even though you fired my ass,
you're still my boy.

1165
01:32:40,285 --> 01:32:44,981
l look out for your best interests.
When was the last time you seen Olarke?

1166
01:32:45,198 --> 01:32:48,154
l don't know. What's up?

1167
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:51,459
Shadow's boning Olarke.

1168
01:32:51,677 --> 01:32:55,329
Oh, Shadow! Oh, yeah!

1169
01:32:55,547 --> 01:32:58,894
Yeah, baby, you like it.
l'm going to give it to you good.

1170
01:32:59,112 --> 01:33:01,633
 lt feels good.

1171
01:33:01,851 --> 01:33:04,416
l'm just a bear, baby,
just a bear.

1172
01:33:04,677 --> 01:33:07,981
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1173
01:33:16,851 --> 01:33:19,851
Hey, you know, it ain't no thing.

1174
01:33:20,026 --> 01:33:21,982
l hope he's happy.

1175
01:33:23,243 --> 01:33:26,591
- Are you positive?
- What did l say?

1176
01:33:33,938 --> 01:33:37,852
Yo, Roberto. l don't want to hear
nothing about no music.

1177
01:33:38,070 --> 01:33:40,373
- What's up?
- Yeah, hi.

1178
01:33:40,591 --> 01:33:43,113
- Yo, Bleek. Yo, Bleek.
- What?

1179
01:33:43,330 --> 01:33:45,287
Hold up for a minute. Check this out.

1180
01:33:45,461 --> 01:33:48,070
Me and the cats
want to have a meeting after this.

1181
01:33:48,287 --> 01:33:54,766
- Get out of my face, Shadow.
- We need to talk about the money.

1182
01:33:54,982 --> 01:33:57,504
See them people out there?
lt's packed.

1183
01:33:57,722 --> 01:34:01,722
l ain't playing shit no more
till l deal with this money situation.

1184
01:34:01,940 --> 01:34:04,592
- Get out of my face.
- Listen to what l'm saying.

1185
01:34:04,809 --> 01:34:08,896
- Just get the fuck...
- Who you pushing, man?

1186
01:34:10,679 --> 01:34:12,635
Kick his ass!

1187
01:34:21,027 --> 01:34:23,375
- Just relax, man.
- You're fired, punk!

1188
01:34:23,592 --> 01:34:24,766
Fuck you, l quit!

1189
01:34:24,983 --> 01:34:27,549
Fuck you and everybody
who looks like you.

1190
01:34:27,766 --> 01:34:31,027
Fucking people over.
Sooner or later it'll come back.

1191
01:34:31,288 --> 01:34:34,419
Anybody else want to go with him?
Take a hike!

1192
01:34:34,636 --> 01:34:37,245
Get his raggedy ass out of here.

1193
01:34:43,114 --> 01:34:45,463
You're fired, punk!

1194
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:48,636
Get him out of here!
You're fired!

1195
01:34:51,724 --> 01:34:54,636
- You're fired!
- Let's talk to Bleek, man.

1196
01:34:54,854 --> 01:34:58,636
l got to get paid. l need this job, man.

1197
01:35:04,854 --> 01:35:08,289
- What's up, Jimmy?
- What's up, Giant?

1198
01:35:08,506 --> 01:35:11,897
Moe and Josh are some
cheap goober snitchers.

1199
01:35:13,202 --> 01:35:15,246
Whoo!

1200
01:35:22,158 --> 01:35:24,333
We don't believe
in killing our brothers,

1201
01:35:24,550 --> 01:35:27,985
but this time
you're definitely going to be hurt.

1202
01:35:28,202 --> 01:35:30,159
Get the fuck off.

1203
01:35:36,420 --> 01:35:38,377
Get off me!

1204
01:35:40,855 --> 01:35:43,551
- lsn't that Giant?
- Bleek!

1205
01:35:54,464 --> 01:35:56,942
What did l do?

1206
01:36:01,420 --> 01:36:03,595
You're breaking my arm.

1207
01:36:04,247 --> 01:36:08,247
- Up, up, and away.
- Chill! Chill! Chill!

1208
01:36:17,638 --> 01:36:20,464
Don't break them.

1209
01:36:27,073 --> 01:36:29,030
That's the way it goes.

1210
01:36:29,943 --> 01:36:31,073
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1211
01:36:31,291 --> 01:36:35,030
Oh, yeah!
One more. Another one.

1212
01:36:36,813 --> 01:36:39,770
The Mike Tyson now. There you go.

1213
01:36:42,987 --> 01:36:45,248
Hold it.

1214
01:36:45,466 --> 01:36:47,422
Bleek!

1215
01:36:56,856 --> 01:37:00,161
- Get the fuck up.
- Get up.

1216
01:37:00,379 --> 01:37:01,944
Bleek!

1217
01:37:10,075 --> 01:37:12,205
Oh, shit.

1218
01:37:12,423 --> 01:37:15,118
Brooklyn style.

1219
01:37:15,292 --> 01:37:19,249
Your alligator mouth finally got
your hummingbird ass whipped.

1220
01:37:19,466 --> 01:37:22,031
- Chill out, man.
- Ain't nothing to see here.

1221
01:37:28,901 --> 01:37:31,119
Bleek!

1222
01:38:08,728 --> 01:38:11,468
Wake up!

1223
01:38:11,684 --> 01:38:14,815
Go on, brother. lt won't be pretty.

1224
01:38:16,859 --> 01:38:18,772
G?

1225
01:38:24,424 --> 01:38:26,990
- l was getting him the money tonight.
- Too late.

1226
01:38:27,207 --> 01:38:29,511
He ain't dead. He be all right.

1227
01:38:31,468 --> 01:38:37,511
- Why you do something like that?
- We going to have to give him some too.

1228
01:38:39,338 --> 01:38:42,120
- Straighten up.
- Oh, shit!

1229
01:38:42,338 --> 01:38:45,685
Damn it, give me the fucking horn.

1230
01:38:47,468 --> 01:38:48,903
Son of a bitch.

1231
01:39:06,643 --> 01:39:09,599
- Get out the way.
- Let us through.

1232
01:39:11,730 --> 01:39:14,687
What the fuck went on here?
Let us through.

1233
01:39:18,382 --> 01:39:21,904
You busted his mouth!
You busted his mouth!

1234
01:39:22,121 --> 01:39:25,296
- Do something, man.
- He's bleeding, man.

1235
01:39:25,470 --> 01:39:28,034
Go back inside and play.

1236
01:39:28,252 --> 01:39:30,730
- No.
- We got a full house in there.

1237
01:39:30,948 --> 01:39:32,991
- Let's close it up.
- Fuck them!

1238
01:39:33,209 --> 01:39:36,470
- Leave it alone.
- We're never playing this place again.

1239
01:39:36,687 --> 01:39:41,730
- Don't say that. You're upset.
- You're goddamn right l'm upset.

1240
01:39:41,948 --> 01:39:45,339
My friend is laying here
with his mouth busted open.

1241
01:39:45,557 --> 01:39:47,861
We're closed. Everybody go home.

1242
01:39:48,079 --> 01:39:52,687
- Did you call the ambulance?
- Are you going to move, or what?

1243
01:39:56,731 --> 01:39:58,470
Get out of the way!

1244
01:40:03,166 --> 01:40:05,123
Don't move him, man!

1245
01:40:25,558 --> 01:40:27,514
The first fight you ever got in,

1246
01:40:27,732 --> 01:40:31,427
your mother wanted me to break it up,

1247
01:40:31,645 --> 01:40:37,210
call the cops,
go and talk to the parents of the kid.

1248
01:40:37,428 --> 01:40:40,210
l figured, kids are going to fight,

1249
01:40:40,428 --> 01:40:46,559
and you must have been only...
six, seven,...

1250
01:40:48,123 --> 01:40:54,559
so we were just talking about
little bare fists, just skin.

1251
01:40:56,776 --> 01:41:03,429
That was way before kids
started shooting each other with Uzis.

1252
01:41:04,645 --> 01:41:07,471
l watched you from the window

1253
01:41:07,689 --> 01:41:10,906
going toe to toe, slugging it out.

1254
01:41:13,559 --> 01:41:19,777
Your mother never forgave me,
but l got to admit l was kind of proud.

1255
01:41:22,473 --> 01:41:26,603
You gave the kid a bloody nose,
but you didn't kill him.

1256
01:41:26,777 --> 01:41:30,603
That's a part of growing up.

1257
01:41:31,908 --> 01:41:35,950
You ran up the stairs, crying.

1258
01:41:36,168 --> 01:41:39,777
You were more scared than the kid was.

1259
01:41:46,081 --> 01:41:49,212
Wasn't that Giant? That was Giant.

1260
01:42:12,865 --> 01:42:15,343
Shit, man. Shit.

1261
01:42:20,039 --> 01:42:22,343
The light.

1262
01:42:22,561 --> 01:42:24,909
Truth is the light.

1263
01:42:25,127 --> 01:42:27,170
Prophetic, right?

1264
01:42:27,387 --> 01:42:31,344
Truth is light, though,
that's the truth, isn't it? Lighten up.

1265
01:42:33,213 --> 01:42:35,518
That some bad shit.

1266
01:42:39,474 --> 01:42:44,214
Trumpet-playing motherfucker.
On trumpet, Bleek.

1267
01:42:44,431 --> 01:42:46,736
Tenor, soprano, saxophones.

1268
01:42:49,518 --> 01:42:53,039
John Coltrane, tenor sax. Tenor.

1269
01:42:53,214 --> 01:42:56,562
You got to improvise that music.
lt's all intricate, see?

1270
01:42:56,779 --> 01:42:58,996
lt goes...

1271
01:42:59,214 --> 01:43:01,996
See? See? See?

1272
01:43:06,909 --> 01:43:11,736
lt's some intricate shit, though.
They ain't ready for this shit.

1273
01:43:17,302 --> 01:43:20,737
<i>And he was the quarterback
of the football team.</i>

1274
01:43:20,953 --> 01:43:24,953
<i>He was thls tall,
blg, flne, black speclmen.</i>

1275
01:43:25,171 --> 01:43:27,258
<i>- Mandlngo, huh?
- No.</i>

1276
01:43:27,475 --> 01:43:31,779
Anyway, the first time
l fell in love was...

1277
01:43:31,954 --> 01:43:33,910
Was when? No, l remember.

1278
01:43:34,128 --> 01:43:37,867
lt was... lt was... lt was innocent.

1279
01:43:38,084 --> 01:43:42,519
- She felt the same way, too.
- Yeah? So how recent was this?

1280
01:43:42,737 --> 01:43:46,476
Last Tuesday. Last week.
No, it was Wednesday.

1281
01:43:46,693 --> 01:43:49,563
- The fourth grade.
- ln the fourth grade?

1282
01:43:49,781 --> 01:43:51,737
Thank you. You had me worried.

1283
01:43:51,954 --> 01:43:55,477
We used to pass notes back and forth.

1284
01:43:55,693 --> 01:44:01,694
One day she met me in the courtyard
after school, and she kissed me.

1285
01:44:01,911 --> 01:44:03,825
- French kiss?
- We French kissed.

1286
01:44:04,042 --> 01:44:06,346
And l was, like, wow.

1287
01:44:08,694 --> 01:44:13,042
- l never felt that way since.
- Not even with me?

1288
01:44:13,259 --> 01:44:15,346
<i>- What ls thls?
- What ls what?</i>

1289
01:44:15,564 --> 01:44:19,782
<i>Are we lovers, or what?
Why don't you try and flnd that glrl</i>

1290
01:44:19,998 --> 01:44:23,477
<i>and marry her
and llve happlly ever after?</i>

1291
01:44:23,694 --> 01:44:25,825
<i>You stlll love me?</i>

1292
01:44:58,391 --> 01:45:02,478
- G.
- Bleek, what's up?

1293
01:45:02,696 --> 01:45:04,434
How you doing, man?

1294
01:45:04,652 --> 01:45:07,783
Where you been? Ain't nobody seen
hide nor hair of your ass.

1295
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,391
You know, l'm...

01:45:10,609 --> 01:45:12,957

1298
01:45:15,957 --> 01:45:19,434
l stopped gambling.
You should be proud of me.

1299
01:45:19,652 --> 01:45:22,261
l still got to go to those meetings
once a week.

1300
01:45:22,478 --> 01:45:24,435
- Good.
- Yeah.

1301
01:45:26,652 --> 01:45:28,826
You sitting in with Shadow?

1302
01:45:29,044 --> 01:45:31,175
We talked about it.

1303
01:45:31,391 --> 01:45:35,957
Yeah? Good. Shadow and Olarke
are doing all right now.

1304
01:45:36,174 --> 01:45:39,957
Yeah, l... l'm happy for him, man.

1305
01:45:40,131 --> 01:45:43,871
He always wanted his own band.
l'm happy for him.

1306
01:45:44,088 --> 01:45:46,870
- Big time.
- Big time.

1307
01:45:47,088 --> 01:45:49,870
- l'm gonna step on inside, man.
- l'll come with you.

<i>You can never tell

<i>And lf he's from Harlem

<i>The man l love

<i>He allows me as no other could</i>

<i>Where l'm told lt's sudden death</i>

1336

Er...

1355
01:49:49,441 --> 01:49:53,963
Right now l'd like to bring to the stage

1356
01:49:54,181 --> 01:49:58,181
and, as well, a very dear friend.

Nah.

1362
01:52:05,358 --> 01:52:07,315
Come on, Bleek.

1363
01:52:09,793 --> 01:52:12,010
Forget about it.

1364
01:52:12,228 --> 01:52:14,706
Man, you're gonna be all right.

1365
01:52:16,184 --> 01:52:18,359
Forget about it.

1366
01:52:18,576 --> 01:52:20,532
Come on, Bleek.

1367
01:52:24,316 --> 01:52:26,272
You'll play again.

1368
01:52:26,489 --> 01:52:28,532
You'll play again.

lndigo!

1374
01:53:19,968 --> 01:53:23,621
Who is it?
Who the hell is ringing my bell?

1375
01:53:27,708 --> 01:53:31,186
Hello, lndigo. Can l come in?

1376
01:53:40,622 --> 01:53:44,187
You didn't return
my calls or my letters.

1377
01:53:45,621 --> 01:53:47,578
Refused my visits.

1378
01:53:52,144 --> 01:53:54,622
lt doesn't matter now.
l just want to...

1379
01:53:54,883 --> 01:53:56,927
lt doesn't matter?

1380
01:53:57,144 --> 01:53:59,709
l haven't heard from you in over a year.

1381
01:53:59,970 --> 01:54:02,187
l didn't know if you were alive or dead.

1382
01:54:02,405 --> 01:54:04,883
l'm sorry. Look, l didn't know.

1383
01:54:05,970 --> 01:54:09,884
l haven't seen anybody.
The only one l've seen is my father.

1384
01:54:10,883 --> 01:54:13,014
You've always been a selfish person.

1385
01:54:13,187 --> 01:54:16,057
l admit that. l'm selfish.
l'm a selfish...

1386
01:54:16,275 --> 01:54:21,100
Did l ever try to stand in your way or
stop you from doing what you had to do?

1387
01:54:21,362 --> 01:54:23,057
Did l?

1388
01:54:23,275 --> 01:54:25,709
Can you get out, please?

1389
01:54:26,449 --> 01:54:28,927
l want you to leave, Bleek.

1390
01:54:30,319 --> 01:54:32,362
l want you to leave!

1391
01:54:35,405 --> 01:54:38,493
l just want to...
Just let me say something.

1392
01:54:38,667 --> 01:54:43,667
The only reason you're here
is because you can't play anymore.

1393
01:54:43,884 --> 01:54:47,797
- Did you stop by Olarke's house?
- lt's got nothing to do with Olarke.

1394
01:54:48,015 --> 01:54:51,884
l read this book, a story
about a plane that was going down.

1395
01:54:52,101 --> 01:54:55,319
lt was going to crash into the sea,
and this married couple,

1396
01:54:55,536 --> 01:54:58,667
they start making love
to each other ferociously

1397
01:54:58,884 --> 01:55:01,188
like their lives just depended upon it.

1398
01:55:01,406 --> 01:55:06,059
They were oblivious to everything.
They didn't care.

1399
01:55:06,275 --> 01:55:09,015
The plane was going down,
they were all gonna die,

1400
01:55:09,189 --> 01:55:13,407
but they loved each other dearly
and they wanted to die together.

1401
01:55:13,624 --> 01:55:16,102
They loved each other.

1402
01:55:17,233 --> 01:55:20,842
- l want to be with you.
- Bleek, stop it.

1403
01:55:27,363 --> 01:55:29,320
- lndigo.
- What?

1404
01:55:29,537 --> 01:55:33,276
- l want you to be with me.
- Get off. What about before?

1405
01:55:33,494 --> 01:55:37,712
- l don't care about it.
- l don't wanna hold you.

1406
01:55:37,929 --> 01:55:41,364
- l want us to have a son.
- Get off me. A fucking son.

1407
01:55:41,582 --> 01:55:44,059
What do you think this is?

1408
01:55:45,059 --> 01:55:49,016
You just want me to drop everything now
and just trust you?

1409
01:55:50,451 --> 01:55:52,929
l want you to be with me.

1410
01:55:53,930 --> 01:55:56,364
- l want you to be my wife.
- You crazy?

1411
01:55:56,582 --> 01:55:58,755
- l'm not crazy.
- Go tell somebody else.

1412
01:55:58,973 --> 01:56:02,712
- l'm telling you.
- You want me to save your life.

1413
01:56:02,929 --> 01:56:05,408
Yes. l want you to save my life.

1414
01:56:05,625 --> 01:56:08,973
Stop it, Bleek. Stop it! Stop it!

1415
01:56:09,756 --> 01:56:12,713
Get off. l don't want to be...

1416
01:56:12,929 --> 01:56:16,756
Fucking bastard. Get off me. Stop it!

1417
01:56:16,973 --> 01:56:20,060
You want me to beg?
l'm begging. Save my life.

1418
01:56:21,452 --> 01:56:23,452
Please.

1419
01:56:25,191 --> 01:56:27,148
Save my life.

1420
01:58:16,890 --> 01:58:20,237
Relatives and friends,
we are gathered here in the sight of God

1421
01:58:20,455 --> 01:58:22,368
and the presence of these witnesses

1422
01:58:22,586 --> 01:58:26,020
to join together this man and this woman
in holy matrimony.

1423
01:58:26,237 --> 01:58:31,064
Will thou, Minifield Gilliam,
have this woman to be thy wedded wife?

1424
01:58:31,281 --> 01:58:33,151
l will.

1425
01:58:33,368 --> 01:58:36,977
Will thou, lndigo Downes, have this man
to be thy wedded husband?

1426
01:58:37,195 --> 01:58:38,194
l will.

1427
01:58:38,412 --> 01:58:40,804
Who gives this woman
to be married to this man?

1428
01:58:40,977 --> 01:58:41,977
l do.

1429
01:58:42,194 --> 01:58:44,195
- With this ring...

Bleek!

1433
01:59:25,891 --> 01:59:27,326

Push, darling, push.

Don't hold him too tight now.
Don't let him fall.

02:00:23,632 --> 02:00:27,545
Congratulations, Mrs Gilliam.
You have a son.

1444

Here, keep the change.
Here, have a cigar.

- He looks like me.
- What do you mean?

1449
02:00:53,633 --> 02:00:55,589
- Look at his nose.
- Come on, baby.

1450
02:00:55,807 --> 02:00:58,416
This is your ball.

1451
02:00:58,633 --> 02:01:02,763
This is your glove,
a present from Grandpa to Miles.

1452

All right, come on to Daddy.
Come on to Daddy.

Yo, Miles!

Sorry, Mrs Gilliam. Can Miles come out?

1481
02:02:47,549 --> 02:02:50,679

Your noise has got to stop.

1482
02:02:50,896 --> 02:02:52,940
Stop yelling outside my window.

1483
02:02:55,635 --> 02:02:58,288
Those kids are gonna drive me crazy.

1484
02:03:00,592 --> 02:03:05,157

your hoodlum friends coming here?

1485
02:03:05,375 --> 02:03:09,593
- Leave the boy alone.
- Can l go outside now?

1486
02:03:09,767 --> 02:03:12,723

1487
02:03:12,897 --> 02:03:14,853
We'll see.

1488
02:03:15,071 --> 02:03:17,114
Miles!

1489
02:03:19,332 --> 02:03:21,680
Son, you're finished for the day.

1490
02:03:21,897 --> 02:03:24,811
Take your time. Put yourjacket on.

1491
02:03:28,680 --> 02:03:30,637

1492
02:03:30,854 --> 02:03:32,332

02:03:32,550 --> 02:03:35,028
Let the boy have some fun now.

1494
02:03:35,202 --> 02:03:37,028
Uh-huh.

1495
02:03:37,245 --> 02:03:39,985
Like he never has any fun at all.

1496
02:03:40,202 --> 02:03:43,332
- He gets to have some fun.
- He has to stay in the dungeon.

1497
02:03:43,550 --> 02:03:46,941
He never has any fun.
