1
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:19,011
[man #1] I think we're
supposed to act Mexican.

2
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:20,814
Three Mexicans in a dark alley.

3
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:25,381
[narrator] This is a story
about three amigos.

4
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:29,554
Not the white ones,
but the brown ones.

5
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:31,654
Three pistoleros

6
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:35,997
tonight will meet their destiny.

7
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:39,732
Passion, action, danger,

8
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:42,798
romance, desire.

9
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,868
You know.
All the same old shit.

10
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:48,937
- [man #1 ] Why did you stop, bro?
- [man #2] I stepped in shit!

11
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:51,711
[man #1 ] You do not stop
in the middle of a take.

12
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:53,946
[man #3] But it's off-camera, Freddy.

13
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,580
[man #1 ] It's a movie.
They can't see your shoes.

14
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:59,989
- Put your feet down, Freddy.
- [man #3] Horse shit or dog shit!

15
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,791
[Freddy] We're walking
in the the dark for God's sake.

16
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:06,195
[man #1] We don't have money
to pay for lights.

17
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:07,699
You still keep walking.

18
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:11,259
- We don't have film to do another
take. - [Freddy] There's no lights!

19
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:14,397
- [man #1] "There's shit there."
- [Freddy] Get me a shoe!

20
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:22,438
Freddy Soto I relate to a lot

21
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:25,848
because his father, that he does
in his act, is just like mine.

22
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,046
The balls that Freddy has

23
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:31,386
to commit to what he does
is impressive.

24
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,551
Freddy is a guy that,
if he wanted to,

25
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:36,618
could go up on stage and
get a laugh every 30 seconds.

26
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:40,024
[announcer] Let's party.
From the proud state of Texas,

27
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,867
please welcome Freddy Soto!

28
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,998
- [hip hop music]
- [people cheering]

29
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,104
What's up?

30
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:57,843
What is up, T exas?

31
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:01,986
Whoo!

32
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,919
I love you all.

33
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:10,292
So, what's up, man?
I got...

34
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:12,763
I know you're gonna be happy
about this shit.

35
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:14,959
I got married.
Dig it. I got married.

36
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:17,025
- [people jeering]
- [chuckles]

37
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:20,834
Some people are booing me.
"Boo! Get out of here."

38
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:24,308
Sound like my family, man.
What's up?

39
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:27,437
It's hard because my chick
was so into it. You know?

40
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:30,210
She's so happy, my beautiful Corey.
She's so into it.

41
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:33,184
"Oh, my God!
I'm gonna be a Mexican!"

42
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:38,682
I'm like, "Babe, it doesn't
work like that. You know?"

43
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:41,989
When she met my family though,
she knew it was gonna be craZy.

44
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:43,722
'Cause my dad comes up with shit.

45
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:46,788
He's got his favorite English word
he says for everything.

46
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:49,198
"Hey, regardless."

47
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:53,964
He doesn't know what it means.
He likes to say it.

48
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,237
"Hey, pendejo, regardless."

49
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,677
He'll just stick it into a word,
whether it belongs there or not.

50
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:04,046
"Hey, Freddy, come over here.
Listen to me. Hey.

51
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:05,482
On the barrel on the side,

52
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:07,679
we need to wax it on the side
regardless,

53
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,314
and on the bottom too,
we need to..."

54
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,755
What did you say, man?

55
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:14,384
Did you throw in a "regardless" in
for no reason?

56
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,590
"No. Not for no reason.
Regardless, it needs it!"

57
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,698
[chuckling] Dad, come on.

58
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,033
He's been doing it since I was a kid.

59
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:28,198
He would ask me
how to spell things for him.

60
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:30,037
"Guy, come over here, guy.

61
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:32,771
How many S's are there
in the word 'shicken'?"

62
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,410
A "shicken"?

63
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:46,216
What the fuck are you
talking about "shicken," man?

64
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,953
He gets pissed and...

65
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:52,293
"Cabron, ese shicken!
How many, goddamn it?"

66
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,465
Well, fuck it, man. Four.

67
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,434
Put as many as you want, brother.
Damn.

68
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:05,272
The way you say it,
there's a lot of S's. I'm just...

69
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,245
I'm just telling you, man.

70
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:08,610
I try to help the guy out.

71
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:11,047
How come it's "shair"
and it's "shicken,"

72
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:13,881
but your knife, it's "charp"?

73
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:19,187
All of a sudden there's a C-H, man.
You know?

74
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,090
And it just pops out. "Choes."

75
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,424
Whoa.

76
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:26,624
Come on, guy.

77
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,133
I was always a smart-ass, man.

78
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:32,228
We lived a stressful life, brother.

79
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:35,832
I had roaches in my house, man.
That's stress.

80
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:37,773
They were just flying around.

81
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:39,937
[flapping sound]

82
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:44,315
Flying around, man.

83
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:47,444
I hated those things too, man.
Roaches are the worst, bro.

84
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,683
My dad used to step on them
and then just leave them there.

85
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,425
Dad, come on. We're in the kitchen.
You wanna pick it up?

86
00:04:56,496 --> 00:05:01,024
"No, leave it so the other ones know
what's waiting for them, goddamn it.

87
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:05,671
Come down, cabrones!
Come out!

88
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:08,002
Let's go!
Bring your friends, goddamn it!

89
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:10,406
I got choes! Let's do it!"

90
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,445
Dad, man, you can spray them, bro.

91
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,174
"l could give them candies too.

92
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,614
[chuckling] Here, take them."

93
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,118
No, man, put a roach motel.

94
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:23,485
"Why? They're already
living in my house!

95
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:25,285
Here's the keys to my car.

96
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:29,624
Drive it around.
Drive it around.

97
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:32,824
No, cabron. They eat here
for free and live here for free,

98
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:35,026
just like my kids.

99
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,433
Maybe I should spray you, cabron. "

100
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:42,704
[chuckling] What?

101
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:45,039
That was the kind of fun we had.
You know?

102
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,976
We grew up broke.

103
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:49,776
When you grow up
kinda broke, you know,

104
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:53,046
you gotta make your own toys
and shit like that, man.

105
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,814
You gotta get creative, bro.

106
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:58,653
I wanted a Slip 'N Slide
so bad, man, in the summer.

107
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:02,559
I had to make a Hefty Slide.
[chuckles]

108
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,964
- [whistling]
- [screaming]

109
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:11,526
You know what I mean, man.
You tape some Hefty bags together.

110
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:14,266
You go lay it out on the front lawn.

111
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,707
You put some rocks down
on the corners.

112
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,143
Right there.

113
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,704
You're out there.
The cars are going by. Vroom!

114
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:25,148
"What the hell are they doing?"

115
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,845
Everybody's going by,

116
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:30,685
and my Dad's watering it
in his fuckin' underwear.

117
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:34,716
"Go ahead, mijo. Take a slide.
It's ready. Take a slide."

118
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,728
I don't wanna!
I don't wanna!

119
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,957
"Take a slide, mijo.

120
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:42,728
Don't worry. When you come down,
I'm gonna pick up the rock.

121
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:46,465
I'll pick up the rock, pendejo.
Don't cry."

122
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,465
Promise you'll pick up the rock?

123
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:53,671
And they never picked up the rock.

124
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,873
You go sailing on that thing.
You know?

125
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,040
Whoo!

126
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:59,949
Whoa! My nipple! My nipple.

127
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:02,249
It got cut off.

128
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:05,757
I got sand in my eye, Dad.
I got sand.

129
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,652
Oh, it was beautiful, bro.

130
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,788
That's how we did it though.

131
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:14,856
We had fun. We liked to play
practical jokes on each other.

132
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,731
Oh, it was a blast, man.

133
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:20,762
My dad liked to take pictures
of you when you were pissed off.

134
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,775
He had a little Polaroid camera.
He'd just take it out.

135
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:28,246
[clicking sound]
"Look at your face.

136
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:31,283
Look at the face
you're making at me, cabron.

137
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,341
You don't love me."

138
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:39,648
Dad, I love you.

139
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:42,319
"All right. Show me.

140
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:45,193
Let's go do something to your mom."

141
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:50,363
I remember I went to...
[chuckles]

142
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:53,428
I remember I went to,
you know, JuareZ.

143
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:56,339
That's where I went to cross.
You know? JuareZ.

144
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,104
It's near El Paso, Texas, man.

145
00:07:58,177 --> 00:07:59,804
[people cheering]

146
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,847
And, uh, you can go over there,

147
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:03,905
and you can get this toy.
All right?

148
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,213
It's a little miniature shoebox.

149
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:07,843
And what you do is,

150
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,582
when you open it,
there's a spider that comes out,

151
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,216
and that little nail
comes out of his mouth.

152
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:17,160
And when you open it fast enough,
it goes right through your knuckle.

153
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,722
Yeah. This is a fuckin' toy, man.
All right?

154
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,793
People get this shit on Christmas
and shit like that. You know?

155
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:29,001
Here, Dad. Open this, man.
It'll scare you.

156
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:32,010
"What? I'm gonna be scared
of you and your little cagada?

157
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,067
[laughing]

158
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:36,376
Que chingado.
No, you're craZy, mijo.

159
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,007
[laughing]

160
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,678
I don't get scared, cabron.
All right?

161
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:44,189
'Ooh, I'm scared.
I'm peeing on my toes.

162
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,316
I don't know what to do.'

163
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,326
He has a little cagada.

164
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:50,862
Let me see how scary you are,
pendejo.

165
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,956
Cabron!

166
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,969
What's wrong with you,
goddamn it? Look at my finger!

167
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:01,632
[Spanish]

168
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:05,775
[whimpering]

169
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,245
Cabron, are you craZy?

170
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:13,508
[groaning] Oh, goddamn it, guy.

171
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:17,080
[sighing]

172
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,882
That's a good one, guy.

173
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,724
That's a good one.

174
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:25,457
Here, let me see it.
I'm gonna go show your mom.

175
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,194
Get the camera.
Get the camera!"

176
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,469
By the end of the day,
my grandmother would be,

177
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:36,406
"They got me too, mijo.
I have a Band-Aid."

178
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:42,812
Just remember that when you start
those kind of things, it's not over.

179
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:46,045
You start some shit like that
in your house...

180
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:48,313
...watch out, brother.

181
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:50,719
'Cause your dad
is right there, man.

182
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,987
They're not adults, really.
They're like little babies.

183
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,857
Mexicans get pissed off.

184
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,691
They pretend like they're not,

185
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,823
but deep down inside,
they're fuckin' pissed off.

186
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:05,604
Dad, did you like that one, man,
with the ring

187
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,502
and the thing
that sting you, man?

188
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:09,975
[laughing] "l liked that one.

189
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,510
I liked that one, cabron.
I liked it a lot.

190
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:14,569
Just remember.

191
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,318
Huh?"

192
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,786
Oh, shit, man.
That was kind of weird.

193
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:26,550
What do you mean?
I thought you liked it.

194
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,184
Don't you like it?

195
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,593
"Pendejo, I liked it!
Just remember."

196
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:38,426
And they won't get you back
in the next week... or two.

197
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:41,166
They'll wait a couple years, man.

198
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:43,973
So you're always
on pins and needles, bro.

199
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:45,135
He got me too.

200
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,702
A year later, I was watching TV,
he comes in.

201
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,238
[groaning] "Hijo, mijo.
I don't know, guy.

202
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,511
[straining] Ah!

203
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:56,316
My back. My back, mijo.
It hurts. [groans]

204
00:10:56,389 --> 00:11:00,120
[Spanish]

205
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:03,286
Mijo, put me some BenGay.
Put me some BenGay."

206
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:06,593
All right, Dad. So I get some BenGay,
I put it on his shoulder.

207
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,760
"Oh, mijo, you have something
on your eye." I go, oh, fuck.

208
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:17,003
Hey, Dad, I can't see.
I can't see, man! Where are you?

209
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:25,243
"Look at your eye, cabron,
in the mirror! It's coming out!

210
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:31,546
[speaking Spanish]

211
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:34,755
Why'd you do it, stupid?

212
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:39,094
Don't get mad, cabron.
Don't get mad.

213
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:42,225
I did it to myself yesterday.
I didn't know either, cabron.

214
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:44,792
But it burns, guy.

215
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,069
Anna, get the camera!

216
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,735
Cabron, no. Hey, hey.

217
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:55,576
Don't start crying, goddamn it.
Don't cry!

218
00:11:55,648 --> 00:12:00,551
No, Cabron. Remember that spider?
Remember that spider?

219
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:05,386
If you do the spider, I'm gonna do
the BenGay. All right? Regardless."

220
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,526
All right, Dad. You got me.
[chuckles]

221
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,495
That's when I go to my mom,
you know.

222
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,363
'Cause my mom will put a stop.
"Mijo, please.

223
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:19,301
Don't play with your father.

224
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,234
Don't play with your father, mijo.

225
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,301
He's craZy.

226
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:32,349
He doesn't know
how to treat children, mijo.

227
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,251
He has the Devil inside of him."

228
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,384
All right, Mom.

229
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,918
- Mom, but my eye still hurts.
- "All right, mijo. Don't worry."

230
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:48,592
[speaking Spanish]

231
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:54,265
[speaking Spanish]

232
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:59,535
Mom, what's that supposed to do?

233
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,843
It still hurts.

234
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:06,078
"You're not gonna go to the doctor,
cabron. All right?

235
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:10,646
They'll never take you to the doctor.

236
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:13,954
That's just some, like,
Mexican witchcraft. "Sana, sana. "

237
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:17,860
You guys know what that means?
"Rub, rub the ass of a frog."

238
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:22,533
Take me to a doctor.

239
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:24,364
[chuckling] They won't do it.

240
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:26,700
It's always a home remedy
for something.

241
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:29,070
Everybody's got 'em.
My grandmother...

242
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,371
You could cut your arm off
at my grandma's.

243
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:36,107
"Don't worry about it, mijo.
Just put some butter on it.

244
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:39,345
Put some butter
and some sour cream.

245
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:42,751
And then rub a potato
and then stick it in the oven."

246
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,086
My dad had a good one.

247
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,720
Dad, I've got athlete's foot.

248
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:55,062
"Oh, really?
You have to pee on your feet."

249
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:59,837
Man, I'm not gonna
pee on my feet.

250
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:01,896
"Oh, you want me to?"

251
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:08,743
Man, get away from me.

252
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:10,679
Mom, Dad wants to pee
on my feet.

253
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:14,446
"Oh, you've got athlete's foot.

254
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,545
Mm-hmm.

255
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:19,455
Yeah, you better let him.

256
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,356
Do you have dandruff?"

257
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,258
Hey, hey.

258
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:27,163
Get the fuck away from me, man.
Both of you are sick.

259
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,794
Everybody's got something, man.
Right?

260
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,169
Where are my black people at?
They know what I'm talking about.

261
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,502
[man shouts]

262
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:37,508
Oh, shit.

263
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:41,435
There's only two
in the fucked-up seats.

264
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:45,276
Oh, shit.

265
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:52,483
Well, I guess we can all
start the meeting now.

266
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:58,490
We all know who's not invited.
Please put on your hoods. Feel free.

267
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,623
Let's get this party started.

268
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,096
You know what I'm talking about.

269
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,898
We got the beans,
you guys have the fried chicken.

270
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,075
Yeah. Fried chicken, watermelon...

271
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:14,044
Look. All the audience is scared
'cause you're nine feet tall.

272
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:18,283
Is that... [laughing]

273
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:21,148
Everybody's like,
"What? Why is he talking like that?

274
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,448
Doesn't he know?

275
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:26,013
Doesn't he know he's from the jungle?
He'll swing down!"

276
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:31,094
Calm down.

277
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:33,427
Come on.
Chinese people have their rice.

278
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:34,898
You've seen that.

279
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:39,131
Right? They eat the rice.
"Oh! I like rice. I like rice.

280
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:43,607
Oh, I like it so much.
I'm crouching tiger."

281
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:45,871
I love that, man.

282
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,908
The ltalian people
have their spaghetti.

283
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:54,112
Uh, the gay people have their
croutons. You've seen that.

284
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:56,017
What'd I say?

285
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,615
They do. They love salad, man.
You guys know that.

286
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,054
You've seen it.

287
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,959
You've seen it, man.

288
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,396
"Ooh! Cherry tomatoes.
Like a testi-cule.

289
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:11,795
Mmm... So salty.

290
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,636
I love it."

291
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,311
I better not piss off
the queers, man.

292
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:21,209
That's a whole other trip.

293
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,613
You piss off a Latino gay, man,
he'll freak out on you.

294
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:28,210
"No, you better stop it, stupid.

295
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,855
No, no, no, no.

296
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:36,293
No, no, no, no.

297
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,956
You better stop it.

298
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:41,761
I'm serious.

299
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,894
You're being stupid.

300
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:47,702
You better stop it,

301
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:51,106
before I start it."

302
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,912
I'll chill out on that.

303
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:05,020
But you try to think of everybody.
You know what I mean? You try to...

304
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:07,354
White people.
We're trying to pin them down.

305
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:09,621
We call them "crackers."

306
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:13,290
It's not doing as good
as I'd like it to.

307
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,458
But they're hard to pin down, man.

308
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,162
They're always in
everybody else's restaurant,

309
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:20,865
so you can't really nail them down.

310
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,601
It's hard.

311
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:28,409
It's hard, man.

312
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,539
You'll see them in your shit.
Trust me.

313
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:33,813
"Whoo. I had the most wonderful
Mexican plate the other day.

314
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,877
I'm still gassy.

315
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,048
[farting]

316
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:40,716
Ooh.

317
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:44,285
Was that me or the salsa?
Dear Jesus.

318
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:47,897
No wonder your people
dance so good."

319
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:59,074
I'm just having a good time, guys.
All right, man?

320
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:06,180
"Why do you gotta make it racial,
dude?"

321
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,515
'Cause it's fuckin' funny.

322
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:12,353
That's all we've got, man,
is who we are and what we were, man.

323
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,791
You gotta know where you came from
to know where you're going.

324
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:22,866
It makes sense to me, man.

325
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,733
My parents let me know
where I came from.

326
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:27,237
Oh, every...

327
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:31,401
Every fuckin' day.

328
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:34,935
"Hey, cabron, you know where
you came from, goddamn it?

329
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:36,640
My balls.

330
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:41,077
Yup.

331
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:45,487
That's where you lived, cabron.
In my little apartment right there.

332
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:49,891
In my two-bedroom apartment,
that's where you grew up. Right there.

333
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:53,295
You were just a little fish, cabron.
Just a little fish.

334
00:18:56,568 --> 00:19:00,004
And you were the fastest one.

335
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,130
Goddamn right.

336
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:03,766
You came out of the Mexican cannon!

337
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,635
And you were born.

338
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,413
And then I don't know how your mom
fucked it up. I don't know."

339
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:17,345
It was awesome, man.

340
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:20,482
I used to push it with my dad
all the time, man.

341
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,925
I loved doing it too, man.
It was great.

342
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:26,431
I used to come home drunk,
like, really drunk, all the time, man.

343
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,160
Not just drunk. I mean wasted.

344
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:33,102
Where you come home and you
take a leak... in one of their closets.

345
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,571
Fuck this.

346
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:44,480
"What the fuck
are you doing to my choes?"

347
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,047
You got athlete's foot, man.
I'm just...

348
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:52,554
Just trying to help you out.

349
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:56,389
Fuckin' A.

350
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:57,894
Whoo!

351
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:01,624
"You better go to sleep,
goddamn it.

352
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,796
Tomorrow you're gonna be the early
goddamn bird tomorrow, believe me!"

353
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:10,365
I think it's funny at the time.
Fuckin' early bird.

354
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:14,071
[vomiting sound]

355
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:19,012
[slurring] Fuck this shit, man.

356
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:22,447
You're being an asshole.

357
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:25,122
Serious.

358
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:30,284
Fuck this shit. I don't need this shit.
I'm moving out!

359
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,660
Brotha.

360
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,790
Moving out.
I'm fuckin' 28 years old.

361
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:36,993
I don't need this shit.
Fuck that.

362
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:45,375
But they'll wake you up
the next day, bro.

363
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:49,505
They'll wake you up at 5:30
in the morning, man. Maybe earlier.

364
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,516
Right? They don't even have to
shake you to wake you up.

365
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,916
All they gotta do is stare at you.

366
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,950
That'll open your eyes, man.

367
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:02,926
It feels like they've been there
all fuckin' night.

368
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:06,761
Then you open your little crusty eye.
You know? Huh?

369
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:09,699
"Hey, good morning!

370
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:14,671
Mr. Party Time!

371
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,332
Let's go, cabron. Wake up.

372
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:19,002
We're gonna reroof
the goddamn house."

373
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:25,077
Huh?

374
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,811
Mom.

375
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:29,844
"Che's not here."

376
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:35,926
Oh, fuck.

377
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:39,760
You're up on the roof, man,
and you're busting your balls.

378
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:42,425
Right? Hammering.

379
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:44,765
You have that
father-and-son tension.

380
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:47,327
You know, where they send you
to go look for shit

381
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:50,500
but they don't know
what it is or where it is.

382
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:55,536
"Mijo, go find me the,
you know, the...

383
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,513
[speaking Spanish]

384
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:01,950
[speaking Spanish]

385
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,649
You know, to put it next to it
and do it. You know?"

386
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:08,693
[speaking Spanish]

387
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:14,388
Dad, I don't know what
you're talking about, man.

388
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:16,161
"Find it."

389
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:20,500
All right, man. Take it easy.

390
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:24,008
Just tell me where it is, man,
and I'll find it. Where is it?

391
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:27,204
"Pendejo, where is it?
It's right there."

392
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,611
Right there?
What do you mean right there?

393
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,114
Everything's right there.

394
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,344
"Don't be stupid.

395
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:36,080
All right? Look right there,
next to the left."

396
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:42,255
Next to the what, now?

397
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:45,319
"lf you don't see it on the left,
then look more lefter."

398
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:51,193
Dad, "more lefter,"
that's not even a word, man.

399
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:55,831
"Well, I'm not in school, Mr. Rogers.
All right, goddamn it?

400
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:58,899
Now look on top of the thing
by the side on the middle.

401
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:03,346
[speaking Spanish]

402
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:07,408
Look next to the top of the thing
by the left that I'm telling you!

403
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:10,717
No, you're not looking
on purpose, cabron!

404
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:13,314
I know what you're doing.

405
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,485
No. No.

406
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,087
Oh! Oh, but if it was your friends
that you got drunk with...

407
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:21,189
Oh!

408
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:23,757
Oh!

409
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:27,362
'l found it!

410
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:31,398
Oh, let me look harder for you,
Sharlie. Look, I found it.

411
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:34,070
I love you, Sharlie.

412
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:37,138
Let's go get drunk
and pee on my dad!"'

413
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:41,248
Dad, that was a mistake.
I didn't mean to.

414
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:43,685
"You better find it,

415
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:47,213
because if I go there
and I find it,

416
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:50,090
I'm gonna kick your ass.

417
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:53,620
Regardless."

418
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:57,794
- [hip hop music]
- [cheering]

419
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:15,987
[Carlos] I can't say enough
about Pablo, man.

420
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:18,148
[Carlos] I can't say enough
about Pablo, man.

421
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:19,690
What he does to an audience,

422
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:22,852
how Pablo makes an audience
cheer and roar...

423
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:25,829
I was like, wow. This guy
does something that I can't do.

424
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:28,798
Pablo just absorbs everything,

425
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:32,325
the good, the bad, the ugly,
and puts it through his filter.

426
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:36,670
[announcer] Please, a warm round
of applause. From Arizona,

427
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:40,199

What's up, everybody?
It's Friday night!

430
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:56,360
Right on. How you doing?
What's up, Austin? How you doing?

431
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:57,690
Whoo!

[beatboxing]

433
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:04,364
[chuckling] How you guys doing?
Feeling good tonight?

434
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:08,035
Austin's a party town, man. Shit.

435
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,039
There's partying everywhere.

436
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:12,770
I've been to New York, I mean...

437
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:15,210
They always got the same
techno clubs too.

438
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,477
[techno beat sounds]

439
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:25,712
"What the fuck is this shit?"

440
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:30,058
[chuckling] Whoo!

441
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:33,393
[techno beat sounds]

442
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:37,899
And no matter what the music says,
people still dance to it, don't they?

443
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:39,903
[techno beat sounds]
 Kill myself

444
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:41,802
"Kill myself."

445
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:44,641
Whoo!

446
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:50,170
People got earrings everywhere too.
[drilling sounds]

447
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:54,207
Face looks like a fuckin' tambourine
and shit. [chiming sound]

448
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:56,681
"Hi!

[giggling] Pikachu!

455
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,740
A bang-bang on my bumba."

456
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:21,009
Can't believe people
get it down there.

457
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,740
"l wanna do it.

458
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:25,339
I wanna do it."

459
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:29,251
- "What are you gonna do?"
- "l wanna fuckin' do it.

460
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:31,881
I'll smoke some crack
and get my pecker pierced."

461
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:35,085
[drilling sounds]

462
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,756
They got jewelry
that goes on your pecker.

463
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,354
They make that shit.

464
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,900
"This one's a bell.

465
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:47,405
It's a little tiny bell,
goes right there on your huevo.

466
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:51,374
When the lights are down, you're
having sex, you can hear it going off."

467
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,809
Like fucking the Salvation Army guy
and shit.

468
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:55,345
Ding! Ding! Ding!

469
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:57,409
Whoo!

Shit, I'm sweating my ass off.
Look at this shit.

477
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:20,096
You can pick up the ladies
though. That music's craZy.

478
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:22,696
Any music can be better
than Backstreet Boys.

479
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:25,106
98 Degrees.
You guys into that shit still?

480
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:28,475
- [man] Yeah!
- "Whoo! Backstreet!"

481
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:31,947
In every song... They don't
understand in every song.

482
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:34,577
 Girl, I don't understand

483
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,695
[gibberish]

484
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:50,434
What's that shit, you know?

485
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:54,666
You walk into a fuckin' grocery store
and there's a magaZine of five guys...

486
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,143
It doesn't sound like music, man.

487
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:02,668
I grew up with The Gap Band.
You know? Remember that shit?

488
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:06,410
[whistles] "Motherfucker, let's go."

489
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:10,113
Blue Oyster Cult. Remember Rick James?
That motherfucker was bad.

490
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:13,453
Rick James... That guy just
tells it like it is. "Pussy!

491
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,184
Cocaine! Come on."

492
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:22,597
Backstreet Boys, man,

493
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:25,966
their music sounds like they're
singing to a Casio keyboard.

494

Some music, man.

500
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:54,094
 I am your fire

501
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:57,601

- ...say
-  I'm a pussy

508
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:19,346
 'Cause I like it both ways 

509
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,417
You guys are hot.

510
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:28,521
"You are hot."

511
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,001
Good-looking women, man.
Ricky Martin, man. That fuckin' guy.

512
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,732
Like Ricky? "Ricky!

513
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:36,603

514
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:39,142

Teases women, Ricky Martin, man.
"Would you like to touch Ricky?

517
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:49,348
No, you cannot.
Would you like to touch Ricky?

No, you cannot touch Ricky."

519
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:57,920
Every song, he's in love.
He doesn't understand either.

520
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:01,488
I don't... I don't believe
in lyrics. You know? Lyrics.

521
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:04,467
 Here I am

522

 Alone again

523
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:12,633
 The whole world
wants to fuck me

524
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:15,406
 But I'm all alone

525
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,608

It is, man.

533
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:47,173
You notice that thing
when you walk in a room.

534
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:49,509
 By my mole

535
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:53,244
 Room is taken over

536

I go for a good-looking face.

537
00:30:57,755 --> 00:31:00,053
Nice body/ugly face sucks,
doesn't it?

538
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:01,819
Doesn't it suck?

Sucks.
And they'll trick you too, man.

542
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:15,128
They'll be on the StairMaster.

Mexican women, they're the best
girlfriends to have, man.

553

That's fuckin' right, man.

554
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:52,369
They get right in your shit.
In my neighborhood,

555
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:55,606
you got a Mexican girlfriend,
you don't need a big brother.

556
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:58,472
You get hit in the face.

557

560
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:11,862
They're the only women
who don't need mace and shit.

561
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,524
I carry pepper spray, fucker.

562

576
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:56,098
Oh, they're outlawing
pepper spray now.

577
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:59,701
Because pepper spray hurts
the criminal's eyes.

578
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:01,335
It hurts his eyes,

579
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:03,744
so if he comes into your house,
let him kill you

580
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,909
because you don't want to go
through a lawsuit and shit.

581
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,976
Well, next you'll
just have pepper.

I met that guy in real life.
He really talks like that.

"Hi, Pablo. Nice to meet you.
My name is Don."

I was like, holy shit!

601

"Hello, Daddy. How are you?"

"Go to your room.
Go to your room.

Take it to the base.
Take it to the base.

690
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:01,064
a word,

691
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:04,232
and think about it so much

692
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:06,742
that it becomes a volume.

693
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:08,369
You'll learn a lot from him,

694
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:11,210
how to express yourself better
by watching him.

695
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:14,080
How he gets things
off his mind, which is...

696
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:16,142
Just a black belt at comedy.

697
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:20,520
[announcer] Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together for

698
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:24,049
Carlos Mencia!

699
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:25,755
[rock music plays]

700
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:43,243
Oh, come on.
You're too nice to me, fuckers.

701
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:45,976
You're making this beaner
feel white.

702
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:50,077
Stop. I'm gonna get used
to that fuckin' treatment.

703
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:53,416
By the way, the old man up here,

704
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:57,257
I apologiZe right now, 'cause I'm
gonna scare the fuck out of you, so...

705
00:39:57,328 --> 00:40:00,559
I just hope you don't have
a heart attack. [Spanish]

706
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:02,861
It's gonna fuck you up.
I'm sorry.

707
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:05,527
I'm already starting.
I don't care. Fuck.

708
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:08,572
See, but I like fuckin'
with old people like you.

709
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:12,006
'Cause you've seen everything.
You don't give a shit.

710
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:16,240
You're not like the little punks
that are protesting war and shit.

711
00:40:16,313 --> 00:40:20,716
"Come on. We shouldn't be
bombing people, 'cause it's not nice.

712
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:23,049
We should send them
love and peace."

713
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,783
You're old. You've seen people.
You've tried to talk to people.

714
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:29,655
You've been there trying to tell 'em,
"Please, stop."

715
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:33,060
And they don't listen to you.
"Stop, motherfucker, stop!

716
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:35,963
God, how many fuckin' times
do I have to tell you?

717
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:37,762
Jesus fuckin' Christ!

718
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:41,904
Fuck."

719
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:43,701
It's a fuckin', you know...

720
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,800
And we're raising them here,
fuckin' stupid people.

721
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:49,812
Idiots, fuckin'
all over the place.

722
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,940
There's no way to get rid
of them. That's the problem.

723
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:58,455
We don't have, like, Jeffrey Dahmer
to come and eat these goofy fucks.

724
00:40:58,522 --> 00:41:01,457
Have you met somebody that
stupid that you wish you had

725
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:05,621
a 1 -800-DAHMER-COME-EAT-THlS-
CULERO-RlGHT-NOW type of shit?

726
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:08,460
They're just fuckin' dumb?
You know what I mean?

727
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:12,161
They go to the mall, and they're
like, "How much does this cost?"

728
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:15,103
It cost $1,900.
"Nah-ah. It says 1 9."

729
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:17,163
Then why did you fuckin' ask?

730
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:19,904
Fuck!

731
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:24,741
You see how some of you
can't laugh at it?

732
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:28,444
'Cause you're... and you know it,
and that's the fuckin' problem.

733
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:32,421
If you're sitting there going,
"l wonder if he's talking about me"...

734
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:36,017
If you gotta ask, pendejo,
I'm talking about you.

735
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:38,994
See the old man laughing?
He fuckin' knows it's not him.

736
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:43,864
He survived. He's there.
You see that shit?

737
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:46,095
Fuckin' smart.

738
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,434
Look at his wife.
She's way cuter than him.

739
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,667
He's a fuckin' smart man.

740
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:51,969
Motherfucker knew.

741
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:54,670
"I'm fat and I'm ugly.
How do I get good pussy?

742
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:57,873
Make better money than all
the other fuckers." Am I right?

743
00:41:57,948 --> 00:41:59,882
That's the way you did it,
viejo.

744
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,815
Look at the lady laughing.

745
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:05,014
"How does he know?"
That's how it happens.

746
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:08,820
That's why you see hot chicks
with ugly midgets all the time.

747
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:11,123
She's all hot, and he's just like...

748
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:14,289
[humming circus tune]

749
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,959
How the fuck did this happen?

750
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:20,733
It's always ugly guys
that have the balls.

751
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:23,864
They're the ones.
Ugly guys are smart. They know.

752
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:27,502
They play the odds. "You wanna
dance? No? Fuck you, then.

753
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:29,637
You wanna dance?
No? Fuck you, then."

754
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,044
They have the balls.

755
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:33,982
And the hot chicks, you know
how you hear it? It's true.

756
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:37,817
Hot chicks go to clubs, and guys
don't have the balls to talk to them.

757
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,981
"She's gonna say no.
She's too pretty."

758
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:42,787
But the ugly fucker, he goes,
"What do I have to lose?

759
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:45,090
I'm already ugly.

760
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:49,064
What's she gonna do, not fuck me?
She's already not gonna fuck me."

761
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:53,092
So he just goes up to her...
[humming circus tune]

762
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:57,231
He doesn't even ask. "Come on.
I like that song, puta. Let's go."

763
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:05,439
Dancing all that old shit.
"Come on, bitch. I know the moves."

764
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:12,645
That's the cool guy
right there.

765
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:16,621
I hate that shit.

766
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:19,356
'Cause, see, what it's
all about is, first of all,

767
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:23,196
stupid people have more babies
than the rest of us.

768
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:26,202
Rich people and educated people
don't have many kids.

769
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,704
A, because it's
really fuckin' expensive.

770
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:32,105
When you're broke, you don't
realiZe how expensive shit is,

771
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:36,112
because you can't afford the shit, so
you don't even think about that shit.

772
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:39,377
You don't think, "Fuck, what if
my mijo goes to college?"

773
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:42,214
You didn't go.
You're not thinking that way.

774
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:45,050
There's parents going,
"I'm a janitor, pendejo,

775
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,147
and why can't you be?"

776
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:53,327
'Cause, you know, it's expected now.
You know what I mean?

777
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:55,729
That expectation.
That's what it is.

778
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:58,825
We go to Taco Bell the other day,
and we get shitty service.

779
00:43:58,902 --> 00:44:02,895
I said, "l want a fuckin' burrito with
no onions. Bean and cheese burrito."

780
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:05,134
I open the shit up,
it has fuckin' onions.

781
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:07,769
So I told my friend
I'm gonna fuckin' complain.

782
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:09,813
"Don't do it.
Just... It's cool, man.

783
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,440
They work at Taco Bell.
What do you expect?"

784
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:15,747
I expect the motherfucker to do
his job. That's what I expect.

785
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:18,049
It ain't my fuckin' fault
you roll tacos.

786
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:20,113
How the fuck is that my fault?

787
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:24,017
I fuckin' snapped.

788
00:44:24,094 --> 00:44:27,723
It's always you fuckin' white people
saying stupid shit like that.

789
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:30,824
That's why the fuckin' Taliban
and all them fuck with us,

790
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:33,631
because you're so goddamn
nice to them all the time

791
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:37,162
that they think they can piss over us
whenever the fuck they want.

792
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:41,769
Hey, fuck that! I'm not putting up
with that shit any goddamn more.

793
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:45,337
I gave him the shit back and said,
"Motherfucker, I said no onions."

794
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:47,543
I even said it in Spanish.
"No cebollas.

795
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:50,178
How many languages will
I need to fuckin' tell it?

796
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:53,746
You will take this back.
You will make me another one.

797
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:56,793
And I don't give a fuck if you
get mad and you spit in my shit.

798
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:01,194
I'm gonna open that fuckin' burrito,
and if I see a moco, I'm gonna be okay

799
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:04,359
as long as there are
no fuckin' onions!"

800
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:15,874
Do your fuckin' job.

801
00:45:15,946 --> 00:45:19,347
Those are the people
that have shitloads of kid.

802
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:21,714
"l got fuckin' four kids
I gotta feed."

803
00:45:21,785 --> 00:45:24,117
Wear a rubber, fucker.

804
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:26,520
Come in her mouth.
I don't care.

805
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:30,185
Jesus, have you ever come
on your wife's face? It's fuckin'...

806
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:31,852
Viejo, tell them
how nice it is.

807
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:35,595
Tell them.

808
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:39,159
Do you see that?

809
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:43,737
See, some of you are like,
"Carlos, that's fucked up.

810
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:46,901
Don't be talking about sex
with that old man."

811
00:45:46,977 --> 00:45:51,346
They've done shit that you haven't
even dreamt of fuckin' doing.

812
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,849
They've been together
for 20, 30 years.

813
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,784
You think he hasn't
bent her over the fuckin' stool

814
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:59,379
with her culo
straight in the fuckin' air

815
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:03,517
put it in her ass and said,
"Dale gas, viejo! Dale gas!"?

816
00:46:05,195 --> 00:46:07,993
You know you have, mama.
You know you have.

817
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:13,367
You know you know what "balls-deep"
means. Don't act like you don't.

818
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:16,463
These kind of little
pussy kids we're raising.

819
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:19,873
I never said that. I got in trouble
in school all the time.

820
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:21,877
Ask my mom if I got in trouble.

821
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:23,469
"Senora Mencia, did you...

822
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:25,640
Did he ever get in trouble
at school?"

823
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:27,206
"No, not that I know of."

824
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:30,515
I never told her shit
She wouldn't have reacted like that.

825
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:32,987
My mother had 1 8 kids.
That's a craZy bitch.

826
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:35,081
You don't fuckin' know her.

827
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:38,390
My mother's like a uterus with
a head. That's my fuckin' mom.

828
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,454
She had babies to the conga.

829
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:44,399
[humming conga]
Just popping shit out.

830
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:47,164
She's like popcorn.
[popping sound]

831
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:51,105
"Maria, Alberto, Jose, Joaquin,
Ramon, move out of the way!"

832
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:57,137
She didn't even know
when I was born.

833
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:00,773
I was 1 6th in my family.

834
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:02,842
Sixteenth.

835
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:06,185
There were 1 5 kids
born before me.

836
00:47:06,256 --> 00:47:09,714
Yeah. I'm not saying
she was loose or anything,

837
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:13,285
but by the time I got there,
it was a fuckin' Slip 'N Slide.

838
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:20,965
For the last three months, I was
holding on. "What the fuck?"

839
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:27,072
She would go dancing.
I could see the disco lights.

840
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:31,839
[Spanish]

841
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,508
You have no idea what it's like

842
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:39,647
to see your dad's dick flying
at you at 3:00 in the morning.

843
00:47:39,723 --> 00:47:43,682
Thank God he was a beaner
and never got that close. You know?

844
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,662
Oh, fuck you. I'm glad he wasn't black,
and I'm sticking to that story.

845
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:49,631
Fuckin' big black dick.

846
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,430
"Hey, that's bigger than
the la... Holy shit!

847
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:56,262
Mommy, chupala!

848
00:47:58,075 --> 00:48:01,238
I don't care what it says
in the Bible. Suck it!"

849
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:09,909
She didn't even know
when I was fuckin' born.

850
00:48:09,987 --> 00:48:14,515
She's washing dishes. I'm hanging
from the cord like a fuckin' pinata.

851
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:17,822
I'm like,
"Come on, puta! Look down!"

852
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:21,888
My brothers are like,
"How come the candies don't come out?"

853
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:23,557
Motherfuckers.

854
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:27,699
A great mom, though.

855
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:32,404
My mom was awesome.
She was fuckin' bad-ass.

856
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:36,742
She raised a goddamn kid that
didn't sit and complain about shit.

857
00:48:36,813 --> 00:48:38,838
That's why everybody
hates America.

858
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,316
"Why do you have so much? Why?"

859
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:43,376
Because we fuckin' work hard.

860
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:47,184
Because we put more hours in
than everybody else.

861
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:53,887
Because we realiZe that, in order to be
a great country, you need diversity,

862
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:56,899
for diversity
is what makes America great.

863
00:48:56,967 --> 00:49:00,425
See? We might talk a lot of shit,
but we let the black people in,

864
00:49:00,504 --> 00:49:04,941
because, goddamn it, every four years
there are Olympics, and they run fast.

865
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,180
We let the chinks in too.

866
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:14,444
"Come on, fucker.
Teach us how to fight."

867
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:19,185
We let the beaners in.
Why? We gotta go to war.

868
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:21,724
And sometimes,
borders need to be crossed.

869
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:25,361
We need experts at this shit.

870
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,121
We have everybody.

871
00:49:33,603 --> 00:49:35,901
See, that's the way
my parents raised me.

872
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,999
Don't cry about shit.
Make it happen.

873
00:49:39,076 --> 00:49:42,568
I never came home, "Mommy,
they were making fun of me at school."

874
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:45,308
My mom would've went,
"Maricon, and you let them?

875
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:49,644
Fag!

876
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,712
Is that a panocha
between your legs?

877
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:56,555
Ay, look at her pussy!

878
00:49:56,626 --> 00:50:00,824
We made a mistake, viejo.
It's a girl!

879
00:50:00,897 --> 00:50:04,128
Look at her pussy. Call your
friends. Get the cigars back!"

880
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:09,263
That's when my mom would look
at my dad and go, "This is your fault."

881
00:50:10,907 --> 00:50:13,637
That's when my dad would
give me that fuckin' speech.

882
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:17,578
"I'm not gonna beat the fuck outta you
because you didn't know the rules,

883
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:19,478
so I'm gonna explain them
to you.

884
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:21,642
Never come home
crying like a bitch.

885
00:50:21,718 --> 00:50:24,846
You had family go to that school
that didn't act like a bitch,

886
00:50:24,921 --> 00:50:27,185
and you have two brothers
that are gonna go

887
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:30,283
and get their chit beat out of them
because you'll be a fag,

888
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,793
and it's not gonna happen.

889
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,830
Second of all,
goddamn it, you fight.

890
00:50:33,897 --> 00:50:36,365
If they kick you out
because you got into a fight,

891
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:39,459
por Dios y mi madre,
I'm gonna be proud of you.

892
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:44,034
[Spanish]
You're the man."

893
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:48,341
Fuck, Dad. What if
they're bigger than me?

894
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:51,245
"Then you stab
that motherfucker!

895
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:55,182
Get a #2 pencil, charpen it,
y dale gas, cabron!

896
00:50:55,252 --> 00:50:59,245
And when it's inside, break it.
pa' que se le quite lo pendejo.

897
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:04,423
That way he have to go
to the hospital to take it out.

898
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:06,485
But don't tell them
I told you that.

899
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:11,900
That's called 'accessory,'
pendejo.

900
00:51:11,968 --> 00:51:16,132
They go 'What happened?'
'l put it in, I slipped, and it broke.'

901
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,672
You gotta have an alibi."

902
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:24,909
Your parents...
You'd be afraid of your parents.

903
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:27,779
My mother is that fuckin' tall.
I swear to God.

904
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:29,785
That's my mom right there.

905
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:34,313
She's fuckin' 90 pounds,
she's fuckin' 60-something years old,

906
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:36,416
and I'm afraid of that bitch.

907
00:51:36,493 --> 00:51:39,155
She scares the shit outta me.

908
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,698
And she beat the shit outta me.

909
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:45,633
I wanna fuck her up before
she dies. Don't get me wrong.

910
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:49,638
And when I hug her, her neck is right
there just waiting to fuckin' snap it.

911
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:53,107
But if I do, on the way down
she'll pull a gun outta her chichis

912
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:54,871
and go, "Hijo de la chingada!"

913
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:57,038
She'll fuckin' shoot my ass.

914
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:05,047
And with my luck,
she won't kill me.

915
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:08,922
She'll just fuckin' hit me in
the head, and I'll be retarded.

916
00:52:08,992 --> 00:52:11,790
You'll see me in ten years.
"Give it up for Carlos."

917
00:52:11,862 --> 00:52:14,262
[slurring]
"That fuckin' craZy bitch!

918
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:17,300
Look at what she did to me!

919
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:21,303
I can't drive in the convertible
'cause my head whistles."

920
00:52:26,743 --> 00:52:29,007
We used to get preventive
ass-whoopings.

921
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:32,708
Kids don't not only get beat, we
used to get beat before we did shit.

922
00:52:32,782 --> 00:52:36,843
You remember going to fuckin' Fiesta
or HEB when you were a fuckin' kid?

923
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:40,185
The goddamn supermarket.
When you stepped on that black mat,

924
00:52:40,257 --> 00:52:43,249
and your mom would look at you
before you walked in and go,

925
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:47,160
"Mira, cabron,
don't embarrass me."

926
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:51,496
What the fuck?

927
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:55,596
I didn't even do shit, Mom.

928
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:57,663
"You better not."

929
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:03,910
I go to Kmart now, I see kids
all fuckin', "l want a Pikachu!

930
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:07,143
I want a Pikachu! You said you
were gonna buy me the Pikachu,

931
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:10,983
but you haven't bought me
a Pikachu, a Pikachu!"

932
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:15,218
If you don't beat the fuck outta him,
I'm gonna beat the fuck outta you.

933
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:17,385
Somebody's gonna
get their ass beat.

934
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:21,191
I don't know who. You pick.
Somebody's gonna get their ass beat.

935
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:27,059
That's how you raise kids.

936
00:53:27,137 --> 00:53:29,605
To respect and shit.

937
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:32,574
But, no,
we don't do that anymore.

938
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:37,045
My mother beat me at fuckin' Kmart
when we were in the parking lot.

939
00:53:37,113 --> 00:53:38,944
Fuck.

940
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:43,349
I was three years old. She just
smacks me on the fuckin' forehead.

941
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:47,279
Pendejo,
remember where we parked.

942
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:54,993
What the fuck, Mom?
We came on the bus, bitch!

943
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:11,240
But we're fuckin' pussies
when it comes to kids now.

944
00:54:11,314 --> 00:54:13,714
"Let's not do that.
That's not fair.

945
00:54:13,783 --> 00:54:16,308
It's not nice, Carlos."

946
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:19,048
Gotta raise
fuckin' bright kids, man.

947
00:54:19,122 --> 00:54:21,056
You gotta push them
to be excellent.

948
00:54:21,124 --> 00:54:23,217
Gotta fuckin' get them
off their asses.

949
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:25,761
Make them understand
you're kicking their ass

950
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:29,230
so that they can have
fuckin' guidance in life

951
00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:32,791
so that they know that they can't
just act like fools and shit.

952
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:36,066
We don't do that.
We're all selfish and shit.

953
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:38,903
"It's all about me, dude.
It's all about me, man."

954
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:42,467
It's like chicks. Always wanna
blame all their problems on men.

955
00:54:42,545 --> 00:54:46,777
It's never their fault. It's never
your fault that you can't come. No.

956
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:51,082
It's not fuckin' possible
that you couldn't fuckin' come.

957
00:54:51,154 --> 00:54:53,088
"He didn't make me come,
Jennifer.

958
00:54:53,156 --> 00:54:55,147
He didn't make me come."

959
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:58,854
No, let's get this shit straight.
You didn't make you come.

960
00:54:58,928 --> 00:55:01,328
Why is it that we never have
a problem coming

961
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:03,457
no matter how fuckin' ugly
you are?

962
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:09,804
You could be fat, ugly. We don't care.
We come because we focus.

963
00:55:09,873 --> 00:55:14,242
When we're fuckin' you,
that's all we're thinking about.

964
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:18,975
The problem is that you don't
think about what you're doing.

965
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:23,486
All of a sudden you start thinking,
"Oh, my God. Should I have done this?

966
00:55:23,553 --> 00:55:26,351
Is he gonna get any ideas?
He better remember my name.

967
00:55:26,423 --> 00:55:27,890
Fucker better call me.

968
00:55:27,957 --> 00:55:31,791
Does he remember my name?
Do I have his number? Do I like him?

969
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:34,193
I think I like him.
Should I grab his ass?

970
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:37,961
Should I let him stick it in my ass?
Should I put my finger in his ass?

971
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:41,970
Do I have milk? I don't think
I have milk. We need orange juice."

972
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:43,528
Holy shit!

973
00:55:43,606 --> 00:55:46,268
By the time you fuckin',
we're coming all over.

974
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:48,777
[grunting]

975
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:51,712
And then you have the balls
to go, "You already came?"

976
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:55,046
I've been fuckin' you
for 45 minutes!

977
00:55:55,118 --> 00:55:57,780
My dick is chafing
at this point!

978
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:04,559
'Cause women don't
apply the same rules. See?

979
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:07,790
You don't understand that men
and women are different.

980
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:11,459
We're completely different.
It's easy to make a man come.

981
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:14,025
It's hard to make a woman come.

982
00:56:14,104 --> 00:56:15,662
- Bullshit!
- Bullshit?

983
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:17,536
See, and I know
why you say that.

984
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:20,405
Because you think that
men and women are the same.

985
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:22,308
But you're fuckin' wrong.
See...

986
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:25,371
For example, men have a G-spot.
Of course we do.

987
00:56:25,448 --> 00:56:28,781
It's an easy G-spot. Every guy
has it in the same fuckin' place.

988
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:30,149
Whoomp. There it is.

989
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:33,053
It never hides.
It never changes.

990
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:35,683
As a matter of fact,
it's retarded-proof.

991
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:37,818
Just in case
you don't know where it is,

992
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:41,159
it gets a little fuckin' bigger
just for your retarded ass.

993
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:45,930
It's my dick's way of going,
"Maybe she's stupid. Here, dummy!"

994
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:51,572
And I know what you're thinking.
"Women have G-spots too."

995
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:54,474
Concur. Of course you do.
The difference?

996
00:56:54,544 --> 00:56:57,741
Every one of you bitches
in this room has a G-spot,

997
00:56:57,814 --> 00:57:01,580
except in every one of you it's
in a different fuckin' place!

998
00:57:08,158 --> 00:57:11,423
Now, how the fuck am l
supposed to find this shit?

999
00:57:11,494 --> 00:57:15,021
You fuck one girl, she comes
when you grab her right fuckin' here.

1000
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,963
The next girl, you grab there,

1001
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:19,433
she goes,
"You gonna fuck me or tickle me?"

1002
00:57:21,671 --> 00:57:25,198
Every time you fuck a girl it moves.
How would you like to be Columbus?

1003
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,675
You discover America,
say "l found it,"

1004
00:57:27,744 --> 00:57:30,975
go back to the same place and,
"l swear it was right there."

1005
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:39,320
Women, you need to understand
that we're different.

1006
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:42,290
You need to understand
that you're very complicated.

1007
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:45,919
See, once a woman learns how
to give one man a blowjob, guess what.

1008
00:57:45,995 --> 00:57:47,656
You graduated.

1009
00:57:49,332 --> 00:57:53,826
You don't need any more classes.
You know how to suck every guy's dick.

1010
00:57:53,903 --> 00:57:56,872
It's different. We learn how to
go down on our girlfriend,

1011
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:59,170
and how to make her come,
and that's cool,

1012
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:01,767
but you only know
how to make her come.

1013
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:05,406
If you did that shit to her
friend, she'd be like, "No.

1014
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:10,419
I don't know who taught you that,
but you gotta fuckin' lick the bean.

1015
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,148
You gotta lick the bean.

1016
00:58:12,222 --> 00:58:15,555
You gotta get the little man
in the boat, bite him and...

1017
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:24,660
See, that's difficult for a man.

1018
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:27,464
And you fuckin' women don't help.

1019
00:58:27,537 --> 00:58:31,633
"What can I do to make you come?
I wanna make you feel good."

1020
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:34,199
Here's your stupid answer:
"Whatever."

1021
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:39,712
You act like you've never seen
a dick in your life. "What's that?"

1022
00:58:39,782 --> 00:58:43,775
"You can do whatever."
Don't fuckin' say "whatever."

1023
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:46,720
Well, don't get mad
when I stick it in your culo.

1024
00:58:46,789 --> 00:58:48,950
"No! Not that! Not that!"

1025
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:52,461
Shut up, puta. You said "whatever."
I know what "whatever" means.

1026
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:55,123
Here's Webster's Dictionary.
Read it.

1027
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:01,995
It's easy for a woman.

1028
00:59:02,071 --> 00:59:04,631
You don't understand
how easy it is for you.

1029
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:08,199
Whatever you do to a dick,
it feels good. Whatever you do.

1030
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:11,213
You can hit a dick like that.
It feels good.

1031
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:15,047
You can lick it. You can
spit on it. It feels good.

1032
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:17,951
You can fuckin' jerk it,
whack it, punch it...

1033
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:22,321
If you stare at a dick long enough,
ladies, with the proper intensity,

1034
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:25,225
and just stare at it,
it'll get hard and go...

1035
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:28,760
Holy shit!

1036
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:30,389
Did you see that?

1037
00:59:34,804 --> 00:59:37,238
Oh! Did you... Holy shit!

1038
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:39,332
You'll be calling your friends,

1039
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:43,743
"She didn't even touch it.
She Jedi-mind-tricked my dick!"

1040
00:59:43,813 --> 00:59:47,112
You can't tell your friends,
'cause they'll be at your house.

1041
00:59:47,183 --> 00:59:49,981
"Where's Amy, dude?

1042
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:53,454
I'm not gonna touch her, fag.
I'm not gonna touch her."

1043
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:57,489
Dale Dudley would be
over my fuckin' house.

1044
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:01,462
- [laughing]
- [man shouts] Yeah!

1045
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:03,999
"l just wanna talk to her, Carlos."

1046
01:00:07,036 --> 01:00:11,769
See? You gotta realiZe this shit
and you gotta grow beyond it. See?

1047
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:15,902
The comprehension of it is one thing.
The understanding of it is another.

1048
01:00:15,979 --> 01:00:17,947
You gotta exercise this shit.

1049
01:00:18,014 --> 01:00:20,482
You gotta understand that
in your generation,

1050
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:23,246
you know what it is
to lose life.

1051
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:27,949
To give up your life for liberty,
the pursuit of happiness,

1052
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:30,458
freedom of speech, so take it,

1053
01:00:30,526 --> 01:00:33,859
instead of crying about shit
like the Taco Bell dog.

1054
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:37,093
Remember that fuckin' bullshit?
All the fuckin' Latinos.

1055
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:40,727
"It's a very negative
misrepresentation

1056
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:43,670
of the Latino people
and culture."

1057
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:47,972
Listen, if you're a fuckin' beaner, and
you look at the fuckin' Taco Bell dog,

1058
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:50,239
and you actually
have the balls to go,

1059
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:52,474
"He looks like me"...

1060
01:00:56,085 --> 01:00:59,248
...how fucked is
your self-esteem?

1061
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:01,847
"l see that Chihuahua,
and I see myself...

1062
01:01:03,459 --> 01:01:05,552
...and I don't like
what it represents."

1063
01:01:05,628 --> 01:01:07,220
'Cause you're a retard.

1064
01:01:07,296 --> 01:01:10,231
'Cause you're so used to
looking at the glass half empty

1065
01:01:10,299 --> 01:01:12,529
that you don't know how
to make shit better.

1066
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:16,504
See, life can be good or bad
depending on how you look at it.

1067
01:01:16,572 --> 01:01:19,097
"The Taco Bell dog, Carlos.
What about that?"

1068
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:21,473
It's fuckin' great.
First, you stupid ass,

1069
01:01:21,544 --> 01:01:24,308
white people didn't bitch
when the Budweiser frogs

1070
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:26,905
started fuckin' talking
all retarded, did they?

1071
01:01:26,983 --> 01:01:28,917
You didn't hear that shit.

1072
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:32,887
You didn't hear people going,
"That's bullshit!

1073
01:01:32,955 --> 01:01:37,119
How come it takes three frogs
to say one fuckin' word?"

1074
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:45,991
No. Just fuckin' beaners.
"Ah, that's fucked up."

1075
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:47,866
Pendejo, look on the bright side.

1076
01:01:47,937 --> 01:01:50,929
White people, you wanna believe
that the Chihuahua dog

1077
01:01:51,007 --> 01:01:53,202
is a representation
of Hispanic people?

1078
01:01:53,276 --> 01:01:56,302
Fuckin' bring it on.
I accept, for he talks.

1079
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:59,348
He is the smartest dog
in the fuckin' world ever to exist

1080
01:01:59,415 --> 01:02:01,280
in the history of the earth.

1081
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:04,183
A talking dog. That's right.
'Cause you know what?

1082
01:02:04,253 --> 01:02:07,347
White people, your dog, Lassie,
that bitch couldn't talk.

1083
01:02:07,423 --> 01:02:10,586
Fuck you and your fuckin' dog.
Your dog ain't shit.

1084
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:15,030
"What's wrong, Lassie?"
[barking]

1085
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:18,890
Taco Bell dog don't fuck around.
"What wrong?"

1086
01:02:18,968 --> 01:02:21,732
- "Your house is on fire."
- "Shit! Gotta go, fucker.

1087
01:02:21,804 --> 01:02:23,863
My house is on fire. Gotta go.

1088
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:26,170
Thanks, puto.
Here's some Gravy Train."

1089
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:30,206
Horse shit. See, if I was black,
I'd be pissed.

1090
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:32,770
Where's the nigga dog?

1091
01:02:32,849 --> 01:02:35,477
Where's a goddamn
ghetto-ass nigga rottweiler

1092
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:39,351
with a bullet wound
in his ass and shit?

1093
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:43,722
Doing commercials for Kentucky
Fried Chicken, motherfucker!

1094
01:02:43,793 --> 01:02:46,455
"Woof woof, nigga, woof woof!

1095
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:50,892
You want some
macaroni and cheese?

1096
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:53,697
Nigga, KFC!

1097
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:56,933
Original crispy!"

1098
01:02:57,006 --> 01:02:58,997
That's fuckin' great.

1099
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:03,006
And the Asians are gonna be mad.
"How 'bout our dog?"

1100
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:06,515
You get a dog too, ching-a-ling.

1101
01:03:06,582 --> 01:03:10,746
A Shih TZu, the one that looks like
you grabbed it by the face and went...

1102
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:17,990
That dog. We got that Shih TZu doing
commercials for Chinese restaurant.

1103
01:03:19,762 --> 01:03:22,356
[out of sync] "lf you're
in the neighborhood...

1104
01:03:22,431 --> 01:03:24,422
[chuckling out of sync]

1105
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:27,401
...we've got Kung Pao Chicken,
Egg Foo Yung...

1106
01:03:29,005 --> 01:03:32,133
...beef fried rice."
[chuckling]

1107
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:36,406
There's a couple of Asians going,
"How in the fuck does he do that?

1108
01:03:38,848 --> 01:03:40,907
I cannot do that.

1109
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:43,975
I could get straight A,
but I cannot do that."

1110
01:03:47,023 --> 01:03:50,857
We need an lrish setter doing
commercials for lrish Spring soap.

1111
01:03:50,927 --> 01:03:53,259
"You ever wake up
in the mornin',

1112
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:55,991
you smell your ass
but you're thinkin',

1113
01:03:56,065 --> 01:03:59,159
[sniffs]
'Motherfucker!'?

1114
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:05,135
You walk up to another dog,
you smell his culo,

1115
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:10,236
and you're thinkin',
'Don't you ever wash your arse hair?

1116
01:04:10,313 --> 01:04:13,749
Haven't you ever heard
of lrish Spring soap?'

1117
01:04:14,784 --> 01:04:16,775
That's what I do.

1118
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:20,448
I scrub my balls
with lrish Spring soap.

1119
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:23,356
Make 'em nice and spring-fresh.

1120
01:04:23,426 --> 01:04:27,157
So when the bitches walk up to me
and they smell it, they go... [sniffs]

1121
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:30,358
'Oh, those are
Lucky Charm-fresh balls, they are!'

1122
01:04:32,768 --> 01:04:35,931
That's right, bitch.
Lick my shillelagh.

1123
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,431
It's magically delicious."

1124
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:42,500
[clicks tongue]

1125
01:04:43,779 --> 01:04:46,873
That's right.
We need a fag dog too.

1126
01:04:46,949 --> 01:04:50,817
I know you fags were thinking,
"He forgot about us."

1127
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:54,345
Au contraire, mon ami.
I love homos.

1128
01:04:54,423 --> 01:04:57,824
Anybody willing to suck my dick
is a good person.

1129
01:05:00,963 --> 01:05:04,626
But we do.
We need a little fag poodle...

1130
01:05:07,136 --> 01:05:10,264
...doing commercials
for K-Y Jelly.

1131
01:05:10,339 --> 01:05:13,001
'Cause sometimes it hurts.

1132
01:05:15,945 --> 01:05:20,780
We need a little fag poodle doing
commercials for Ricky Martin concerts.

1133
01:05:22,818 --> 01:05:26,754
That's right. You heard Pablo earlier
talk about his faggoty ass.

1134
01:05:26,822 --> 01:05:30,314
I don't even care that he's gay.
Just fuckin' tell me the truth.

1135
01:05:30,393 --> 01:05:32,452
Don't play that bullshit game.

1136
01:05:32,528 --> 01:05:36,020
Do you know that Ricky Martin
thinks you're bigots? That's right.

1137
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:38,862
He thinks every one
of you motherfuckers is a bigot,

1138
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:41,563
and he also thinks
that you guys are anti-gay.

1139
01:05:41,637 --> 01:05:44,970
If he didn't, he wouldn't have a
problem coming out of the closet,

1140
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:48,010
but he thinks as soon as you
find out he sucks dick,

1141
01:05:48,077 --> 01:05:50,068
you're not gonna buy his albums.

1142
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:52,637
It's about you. And you know
what I say to Ricky?

1143
01:05:52,715 --> 01:05:56,207
Fuck you. First of all, if you
suck dick, I don't give a shit.

1144
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:59,516
I don't care whose balls you lick
or where you stick your ass.

1145
01:05:59,588 --> 01:06:01,249
That has nothing to do with me.

1146
01:06:01,324 --> 01:06:04,384
If you sing good music that makes
a chick wanna suck my dick,

1147
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:08,294
then power to you, motherfucker.
That's the way I look at that shit.

1148
01:06:09,832 --> 01:06:11,766
Don't get mad when they ask you.

1149
01:06:11,834 --> 01:06:15,964
They're gonna ask you, 'cause
you act like a fag and then not.

1150
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:18,370
They asked him.
Remember Barbara Walters?

1151
01:06:18,441 --> 01:06:19,806
"Are you gay?"

1152
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:23,276
"Some things you just
keep to yourself."

1153
01:06:23,346 --> 01:06:25,712
Fag answer, my friend.

1154
01:06:25,781 --> 01:06:28,215
That is a fag answer.

1155
01:06:28,284 --> 01:06:30,684
Let me show you
a real-man answer.

1156
01:06:30,753 --> 01:06:32,948
"Mr. Mencia,
there's a rumor you're gay.

1157
01:06:33,022 --> 01:06:34,819
How would you like to address it?"

1158
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:38,451
By eating your pussy, Barbara,
on national television.

1159
01:06:38,527 --> 01:06:42,657
Spread that crusty old
fuckin' 2020 snatch

1160
01:06:42,732 --> 01:06:44,723
and let me in!

1161
01:06:46,369 --> 01:06:49,827
'Cause, goddamn it...
[Spanish]

1162
01:06:49,905 --> 01:06:53,841
So bring that skanky pussy
my way. I roll my R's, bitch.

1163
01:06:53,909 --> 01:06:55,968
[trilling]

1164
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:01,710
What?

1165
01:07:03,285 --> 01:07:05,344
Why are you covering
your fuckin' face?

1166
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:07,150
I know who you are.

1167
01:07:07,223 --> 01:07:09,919
You're the kind that,
when your boyfriend farts,

1168
01:07:09,992 --> 01:07:13,018
you get all fuckin'... [whining]

1169
01:07:14,063 --> 01:07:16,395
"That's not funny, Kevin.

1170
01:07:16,465 --> 01:07:18,797
It's fuckin' gross."

1171
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:21,166
Don't be doing that shit.
Let a man be a man.

1172
01:07:21,237 --> 01:07:22,966
I'm a fuckin' man, and I fart.

1173
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:26,236
I got stains on my motherfuckin'
underwears right now.

1174
01:07:26,308 --> 01:07:29,800
Big, brown, chocolate stains,
'cause I'm a motherfuckin' man.

1175
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:33,679
I don't wanna hear your shit, ladies.
We do shit for you. That's right.

1176
01:07:33,749 --> 01:07:35,876
That is symbiosis.
It's a balance.

1177
01:07:35,951 --> 01:07:38,715
It ain't one or the other.
It's one and the other.

1178
01:07:38,788 --> 01:07:40,483
"But I have to smell
your farts!"

1179
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:43,047
Yeah, but I do shit
for you too, mija.

1180
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:46,094
"No! I have to smell
your farts!"

1181
01:07:46,162 --> 01:07:50,656
And I have to wash your blood
off my cock! So shut the fuck up!

1182
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:59,037
Look at how some of the women
can't laugh.

1183
01:07:59,108 --> 01:08:00,837
No!

1184
01:08:02,344 --> 01:08:04,744
Hey, ladies, it ain't our fault.

1185
01:08:04,814 --> 01:08:07,248
It's your fault.
That's right, don't go...

1186
01:08:07,316 --> 01:08:10,080
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.
Yes, it is.

1187
01:08:10,152 --> 01:08:14,521
Do you think that we wanna have sex
with you when you're on your period?

1188
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:18,549
Listen, mija. You have this hole,
this hole, this hole, this hole,

1189
01:08:18,627 --> 01:08:20,561
and with some K-Y, this hole.

1190
01:08:20,629 --> 01:08:23,962
Do you understand that?
That's five alternative holes.

1191
01:08:24,033 --> 01:08:28,868
Why would we wanna stick it in the one
that looks like a dead rooster?

1192
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:30,565
Huh? 'Cause you lie to us.

1193
01:08:30,639 --> 01:08:33,437
You're horny and you start
playing with our dick,

1194
01:08:33,509 --> 01:08:36,410
and we're like, "You know
what time of the month it is,"

1195
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:41,781
and you look at your fuckin' man
and you go, "Ay, I'm only spotting!"

1196
01:08:41,851 --> 01:08:43,876
You fuckin' liar!

1197
01:08:45,254 --> 01:08:47,415
And we believe your stupid ass.

1198
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:51,324
Then we're in the fuckin' shower.
Holy shit! My balls are bleeding!

1199
01:08:53,696 --> 01:08:56,631
"You're a cochino. It's not that bad.
It's only blood.

1200
01:08:56,699 --> 01:09:00,260
Bullshit! What are these
little chunky things on my nuts?

1201
01:09:02,771 --> 01:09:05,763
I did not order
Hamburger Helper.

1202
01:09:10,546 --> 01:09:13,071
That's right. I said it.

1203
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:17,643
'Cause I'm inspired. I hope
this movie inspires people too.

1204
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:19,654
'Cause I have shit
that inspires me.

1205
01:09:19,722 --> 01:09:23,488
I'm gonna fuckin' even be
craZier than I was before,

1206
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:26,153
because now I know
that people die for this shit,

1207
01:09:26,228 --> 01:09:30,597
for our right to have a little fuckin'
good time amongst each other.

1208
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:32,861
But no, we gotta be pussies.

1209
01:09:32,935 --> 01:09:37,133
Well, watch Braveheart and act
like the motherfucker's American

1210
01:09:37,206 --> 01:09:40,642
so that you can hear him say,
and you can feel it in your heart,

1211
01:09:40,709 --> 01:09:43,473
and if there's any
Middle Eastern people out there

1212
01:09:43,546 --> 01:09:47,004
or any fuckers offended to the point
where you wanna fuck with me,

1213
01:09:47,082 --> 01:09:50,540
Iet me tell you something:
you will never fuckin' ever scare me

1214
01:09:50,619 --> 01:09:55,215
or people into coming and fuckin'
being real human beings and Americans.

1215
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:59,387
'Cause you can fuckin' take our planes,
you can take down our buildings,

1216
01:09:59,461 --> 01:10:01,395
you can fuckin' bring us to war,

1217
01:10:01,463 --> 01:10:04,796
but you know what you can't take,
Ahmed Raheem Salaam?

1218
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:07,028
Our motherfuckin' freedom to say

1219
01:10:07,102 --> 01:10:10,868
"Kiss my motherfuckin'
American ass."

1220
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:12,237
Good night, everybody!

1221
01:10:12,308 --> 01:10:15,277
Thank you for coming out
to The Three Amigos!

1222
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:32,217
And keep it going
for Mr. Pablo Francisco!

1223
01:10:32,294 --> 01:10:36,253
That's my boy! That's my boy
in the motherfuckin' house!

1224
01:10:36,332 --> 01:10:39,768
Don't stop, goddamn it! Don't
stop! Get it, get it, Mr....

1225
01:10:39,835 --> 01:10:42,099
...Freddy Soto!

1226
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:46,064
 Who's the man?
Who's the man?

1227
01:10:46,141 --> 01:10:48,905
Freddy and Pablo and Carlos.

1228
01:10:48,978 --> 01:10:51,378
- The three...
- [audience] Amigos!

1229
01:10:51,447 --> 01:10:53,005
Thank you. We're outta here.

1230
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:55,573
Good night, Texas!

1231
01:10:55,651 --> 01:10:58,916
[whooping, hollering]

1232
01:10:59,021 --> 01:11:00,511
Whoo!

1233
01:11:00,556 --> 01:11:02,649
- Rockin' show.
- [Pablo] I'm numb.

1234
01:11:02,725 --> 01:11:06,058
- [Freddy] Right on, man.
- [Carlos] That was so awesome.

1235
01:11:06,128 --> 01:11:10,963
[all chattering at once]

1236
01:11:12,668 --> 01:11:15,728
[narrator]
As the night draws to a close,

1237
01:11:15,804 --> 01:11:18,602
and you walk
out of this theater

1238
01:11:18,674 --> 01:11:21,404
to face your own destiny,

1239
01:11:22,678 --> 01:11:25,374
just remember this;

1240
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:27,472
There are no refunds.

1241
01:11:27,549 --> 01:11:29,881
[man]
Whoo-ha-ha-ha-ha!
