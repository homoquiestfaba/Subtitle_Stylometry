00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,600
Hello, how are you darling? When will we see?

2
00:01:53,175 --> 00:01:57,705
I will not be ready by then. I have one last patient.

3
00:01:58,182 --> 00:02:01,677
I know it's late. But it is a new patient.

4
00:02:02,464 --> 00:02:05,061
I could not say no. He insisted so much.

5
00:02:05,604 --> 00:02:09,794
What could I do? I have healing powers in my hands.

6
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:13,043
Yes, for you too, dear.

7
00:02:13,057 --> 00:02:14,383
But with you I am hard.

8
00:02:20,334 --> 00:02:22,432
Hello. Your Welcome. Pass.

9
00:02:22,572 --> 00:02:23,587
Before starting ...

10
00:02:23,624 --> 00:02:26,546
... I like having the history of my new patients.

11
00:02:26,582 --> 00:02:29,181
Please complete this form.

12
00:02:29,217 --> 00:02:32,398
Put your bag there. So we can start.

13
00:02:32,746 --> 00:02:37,058
As said by telephone, has herniated disc.

14
00:02:37,094 --> 00:02:38,747
I know it's very painful.

15
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,066
Are you sure it's your first time?

16
00:02:52,037 --> 00:02:53,654
Has familiar face.

17
00:02:54,418 --> 00:02:56,272
And I never forget a face.

18
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,479
-give Me your hand. -just Leave me alone.

19
00:04:10,242 --> 00:04:15,481
Come on, I can help. Do you want to kill you?

20
00:04:15,517 --> 00:04:16,487
Yup.

21
00:04:16,731 --> 00:04:20,524
No ... Come on, come ...

22
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,372
I do not want your help. Let me go, please!

23
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,574
-Oh Shit. -stay With me!

24
00:04:31,011 --> 00:04:35,225
Come on, stop fighting. Stop fighting, I can help.

25
00:04:35,253 --> 00:04:37,686
Not want to do this. -if I want to.

26
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:41,363
Everything will be fine. Give me your hand.

27
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,922
The hand ... I do not want.

28
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,197
That's it. They Watch.

29
00:04:52,613 --> 00:04:53,500
What look?

30
00:04:53,501 --> 00:05:00,866
Your beautiful bracelet. Want to eat something?

31
00:05:00,902 --> 00:05:03,408
-and Had lunch. -an Ice cream?

32
00:05:03,444 --> 00:05:06,306
No, I have to go now. What's your hurry?

33
00:05:06,342 --> 00:05:08,219
What do you care? What do you care?

34
00:05:08,567 --> 00:05:11,993
We could go for a coffee. Do Not?

35
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,080
Mind your own business. That all right.

36
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:28,091
You do not worry. Get in the car. That all right.

37
00:05:32,597 --> 00:05:34,382
'There is. -Thx.

38
00:05:39,603 --> 00:05:41,574
You want this? -no Thanks.

39
00:05:42,753 --> 00:05:46,278
So what like me first?

40
00:05:47,976 --> 00:05:49,240
Both are rich.

41
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,036
Not for me.

42
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,994
You always distresses your parents well?

43
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,267
I see my parents!

44
00:05:55,757 --> 00:05:59,727
'Do not you live with them? No, I live alone. I have a lot of money.

45
00:05:59,764 --> 00:06:01,437
How old are you? 14? 15?

46
00:06:01,473 --> 00:06:06,049
-16 Do you still go to school?

47
00:06:06,085 --> 00:06:10,333
Stop asking me questions. Basta. Huh?

48
00:06:11,616 --> 00:06:12,432
Sorry ...

49
00:06:15,966 --> 00:06:22,719
... Is that I also had marks as well.

50
00:06:22,754 --> 00:06:26,108
You do not know anything about me. Yeah I know.

51
00:06:26,144 --> 00:06:27,296
You do not now.

52
00:06:28,891 --> 00:06:30,826
If you have drug problems I can help you.

53
00:06:30,862 --> 00:06:33,712
I do not have drug problems. You Only ...

54
00:06:44,706 --> 00:06:45,689
Are you happy?

55
00:06:47,353 --> 00:06:49,535
Are you happy I'm eating?

56
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:50,366
Yup

57
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:53,802
Well, I go to the bathroom.

58
00:07:31,342 --> 00:07:33,180
One moment, we want to talk to you.

59
00:07:33,216 --> 00:07:34,756
I did nothing, they make a mistake.

60
00:07:34,813 --> 00:07:37,677
I study visit Romania.

61
00:07:37,741 --> 00:07:40,375
Looks like we were right. But committed no crime.

62
00:07:40,411 --> 00:07:41,907
We take you to the clinic Ferriday.

63
00:07:41,943 --> 00:07:45,022
-¡No! -Aura Petruscu, vamos.

64
00:07:45,059 --> 00:07:48,071
Do not take me there, I have a lot of money ...

65
00:07:48,211 --> 00:07:49,801
... I can give you thousands of dollars.

66
00:07:49,838 --> 00:07:52,329
Do not worry, we'll take you there.

67
00:07:52,433 --> 00:07:54,218
The law says we should take with your parents.

68
00:07:59,387 --> 00:08:02,781
-Help. -Déjenla Go.

69
00:08:04,998 --> 00:08:09,110
Relax, everything is under control. Walk.

70
00:08:24,859 --> 00:08:26,300
Home Sweet Home.

71
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:32,203
Leave me alone! Let me go! Damn It!

72
00:08:41,015 --> 00:08:41,856
What do you want?

73
00:08:41,892 --> 00:08:43,898
Good evenning. We are Metro Youth Services.

74
00:08:44,142 --> 00:08:46,009
-Yes Y? We brought her daughter.

75
00:08:46,045 --> 00:08:48,720
Ah, my beautiful daughter.

76
00:08:52,356 --> 00:08:54,849
My beautiful girl.

77
00:08:55,819 --> 00:08:59,919
I am the mother of this difficult but beautiful girl.

78
00:09:00,579 --> 00:09:00,650
Thank you for bringing me back my baby.

79
00:09:00,686 --> 00:09:06,049
They have been very kind. Thank You.

80
00:09:10,797 --> 00:09:13,304
It was for your sake that you got in that clinic.

81
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,891
There you will stay until we decide what to do.

82
00:09:17,447 --> 00:09:20,100
Let me go. I hate being there.

83
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,621
Please do not make me go back. I will die.

84
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,891
Stephan! Look who's back.

85
00:09:25,238 --> 00:09:31,399
Two policemen brought as a criminal.

86
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:37,507
What a surprise. It always causes problems for your mother.

87
00:09:37,603 --> 00:09:40,354
Sorry, Daddy. But the clinic is horrible.

88
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,091
I want to kill.

89
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:46,992
Take her up and give her some tea ...

90
00:09:48,135 --> 00:09:49,174
... I wait inside.

91
00:09:50,248 --> 00:09:51,733
Come On.

92
00:09:58,523 --> 00:10:02,256
This is too much. Your mother is very angry.

93
00:10:02,454 --> 00:10:03,795
I know, Daddy. But let me stay here.

94
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,640
-stop It. I swear I'll be better.

95
00:10:05,676 --> 00:10:07,195
Your mother has a lot to think about today.

96
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,927
-Another Session spiritualist? -A Large.

97
00:10:12,428 --> 00:10:14,838
Then I'll take dinner.

98
00:10:14,874 --> 00:10:19,387
Try to eat. Make your mother is happy.

99
00:10:19,491 --> 00:10:22,954
-I Am not hungry. -Aura, You should eat.

100
00:10:22,991 --> 00:10:25,550
So you will return to the clinic.

101
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:41,800
Good night, Stephan.

102
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:02,451
I'm glad to see you. Give me your umbrella.

103
00:11:02,591 --> 00:11:05,869
It's a horrible night. But just like the spirits.

104
00:11:06,321 --> 00:11:11,265
She is very good. When Nicholas start talking.

105
00:11:11,406 --> 00:11:14,095
Look at my hands.

106
00:11:15,585 --> 00:11:18,191
I'm the one who called.

107
00:11:20,387 --> 00:11:22,283
Oh my goodness.

108
00:11:51,481 --> 00:11:53,048
Am I late?

109
00:12:26,518 --> 00:12:27,765
Will Get?

110
00:12:45,134 --> 00:12:46,143
Ask Question.

111
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:49,538
Can we communicate with my mother?

112
00:12:49,574 --> 00:12:55,147
We have so many questions, we're here.

113
00:12:57,262 --> 00:13:04,753
Nicholas, my dear. You help us?

114
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:15,388
Nicholas, are you here tonight?

115
00:13:18,895 --> 00:13:20,383
I'm looking for.

116
00:13:25,128 --> 00:13:28,671
Let me in.

117
00:13:29,492 --> 00:13:31,465
Let me in.

118
00:13:35,932 --> 00:13:42,115
This is not Nicholas. There is another spirit here.

119
00:13:43,203 --> 00:13:44,300
He is trying to enter.

120
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:55,129
A soul that follows the newly dead ...

121
00:13:55,165 --> 00:13:59,084
... Who follow their murderers.

122
00:13:59,328 --> 00:14:00,440
Speaks ...

123
00:14:03,045 --> 00:14:05,746
My head.

124
00:14:06,785 --> 00:14:10,212
They took me head!

125
00:14:13,765 --> 00:14:16,619
A monster with a bow.

126
00:14:18,627 --> 00:14:31,197
I was not the first, nor will I be the last.

127
00:14:33,067 --> 00:14:37,326
I know who the murderer.

128
00:14:39,611 --> 00:14:43,871
Am I the only one who knows!

129
00:14:44,702 --> 00:14:46,987
The murderer is ...

130
00:14:47,402 --> 00:14:48,753
¡Presente!

131
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,765
Do not break the chain.

132
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,916
I see you!

133
00:14:59,994 --> 00:15:06,294
You can not hide from me! I know you.

134
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,926
¡Mami! ¡Mami!

135
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,485
You must have seen something. Who was?

136
00:16:47,004 --> 00:16:49,099
I did not see anything.

137
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,900
If anything I saw.

138
00:16:52,163 --> 00:16:55,747
Had the heads in front of his face.

139
00:16:58,863 --> 00:17:04,680
Look at those strange things. Should be things of the occult.

140
00:17:05,772 --> 00:17:08,546
It's getting late. Bring me home.

141
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:14,491
There was something wrong from the start. I sensed.

142
00:17:16,362 --> 00:17:17,957
Did not hear anything?

143
00:17:31,177 --> 00:17:34,052
Do you have another relative other than their parents?

144
00:17:34,089 --> 00:17:37,983
No, Captain. Until his recent escape was under ...

145
00:17:38,019 --> 00:17:41,969
-... My care. -for Real?

146
00:17:42,005 --> 00:17:45,171
It was my patient in Ferriday clinic.

147
00:17:45,207 --> 00:17:48,062
Her parents wanted there.

148
00:17:48,098 --> 00:17:49,707
What was it?

149
00:17:49,743 --> 00:17:52,365
No what I can say, Captain.

150
00:17:52,402 --> 00:17:55,035
But it has nothing to do with it.

151
00:17:55,071 --> 00:17:59,860
We take her back. Needs our help.

152
00:17:59,896 --> 00:18:04,395
Go to the center tomorrow and fill the forms ...

153
00:18:04,431 --> 00:18:06,567
... With youth services. Sure that the delivered ...

154
00:18:06,603 --> 00:18:09,831
... After the interrogate.

155
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:20,650
Another strange double murder and you go insane 4.

156
00:18:20,686 --> 00:18:23,592
The striking steel workers renegotiated.

157
00:18:23,628 --> 00:18:26,663
Price increases damaged their pockets.

158
00:18:27,842 --> 00:18:29,598
It seems you could have fun with that.

159
00:18:29,634 --> 00:18:31,762
They call it the "Hunt-Heads".

160
00:18:32,318 --> 00:18:33,903
That I heard.

161
00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:36,287
I suppose you what Grace said.

162
00:18:36,739 --> 00:18:39,046
Yes, we talked occasionally.

163
00:18:39,082 --> 00:18:40,995
Then you will be told how he is.

164
00:18:41,966 --> 00:18:44,178
Do not worry Mark, nobody saw.

165
00:18:44,201 --> 00:18:48,001
What comic, you're very funny.

166
00:18:48,037 --> 00:18:50,808
Now can we work?

167
00:18:50,844 --> 00:18:54,589
Do you you do Arnie, plus fat?

168
00:18:55,769 --> 00:19:00,689
We have a main compound using the KKK last night ...

169
00:19:00,726 --> 00:19:03,424
... Landing ship ...

170
00:19:03,937 --> 00:19:08,493
... And the president's trip to Belgrade.

171
00:19:08,494 --> 00:19:08,946
Is there sex?

172
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:12,023
It is probable, the first lady will not go.

173
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:15,368
Forget it. I think there was sex in the Tour de France. OK?

174
00:19:15,786 --> 00:19:19,362
God will not appear in front of it.

175
00:19:19,813 --> 00:19:20,848
Welcome Grace.

176
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:23,750
Can not we do something more stylish?

177
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:27,006
I did this. But not yet finished.

178
00:19:27,109 --> 00:19:28,807
That's better. -is Not it.

179
00:19:28,924 --> 00:19:31,764
I'd rather have just written something.

180
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,240
Maybe "Hunt-Heads"

181
00:19:33,446 --> 00:19:35,210
-what A great idea. -Originalísimo.

182
00:19:36,285 --> 00:19:40,926
I have to go back. Ben wants you to review the ads.

183
00:19:46,655 --> 00:19:49,502
Grace, which is that suit you well.

184
00:19:49,539 --> 00:19:52,046
'I know we can give. I what?

185
00:19:52,082 --> 00:19:54,505
Great lyrics written as blood.

186
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,299
3 meters high.

187
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:05,597
Hi Yes. Speaks him.

188
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,976
Of course I love her. Where the hell are you?

189
00:20:12,903 --> 00:20:16,600
I only got $ 6 to eat.

190
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:18,878
I was wandering all night.

191
00:20:19,953 --> 00:20:20,913
How you find me?

192
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:25,150
For your document. First I called your house.

193
00:20:25,637 --> 00:20:27,986
'Are not you go? -Do Not.

194
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,074
Looking for a place to stay?

195
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:37,955
No, I need something more. Would you want to help me?

196
00:20:39,142 --> 00:20:40,969
You Need some more money? -Do Not.

197
00:20:42,882 --> 00:20:43,761
So what?

198
00:20:46,725 --> 00:20:48,198
I want to go home.

199
00:20:49,845 --> 00:20:52,427
Want to go home? I'll take you.

200
00:20:54,308 --> 00:20:56,307
Come to my office and call your parents.

201
00:20:56,308 --> 00:20:57,558
Everything's gonna be all right.

202
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:05,425
Will not you raise and call your parents?

203
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:17,162
Okay, I will go find my keys. Wait for me?

204
00:21:17,742 --> 00:21:21,008
There were two other victims beheaded last night ...

205
00:21:21,044 --> 00:21:23,873
... In a house opposite the park Inhamus the north.

206
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:26,401
The victims were two professional spiritualists.

207
00:21:26,437 --> 00:21:27,818
Stephan y Adrianne Petrescu.

208
00:21:27,855 --> 00:21:32,632
Captain Travis, Do victims are random or is there a pattern?

209
00:21:32,669 --> 00:21:35,699
We know that all were paralyzed by a stroke ...

210
00:21:35,735 --> 00:21:38,482
... And were aware during the murder.

211
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:40,442
Do you see that never shows any of those idiots?

212
00:21:40,687 --> 00:21:42,188
I'm going out for a while.

213
00:21:42,224 --> 00:21:45,424
Immigrants from Romania, 10 years ...

214
00:21:45,461 --> 00:21:47,409
... And had an only daughter, Aura, 16.

215
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:48,581
Tell Grace I had to leave.

216
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:51,098
I have a very good track for a note.

217
00:21:51,134 --> 00:21:53,677
The child is reported missing since last night.

218
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,872
Aura, why you wanna go home?

219
00:21:57,908 --> 00:21:59,754
I need some clothes.

220
00:22:01,037 --> 00:22:02,117
How did you know my name?

221
00:22:03,025 --> 00:22:04,518
I saw it on the news ...

222
00:22:06,764 --> 00:22:08,400
... I'm sorry ...

223
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,373
... I can not imagine how you feel.

224
00:22:12,854 --> 00:22:16,215
Do not have relatives who can stay?

225
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:18,400
It's not your business.

226
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:24,045
I just wanted to help. I do not need your help.

227
00:22:24,081 --> 00:22:26,630
I do not think we should go home.

228
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:29,098
I think you should see a doctor.

229
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:34,388
Doctor! I will not see more doctors!

230
00:22:35,851 --> 00:22:40,671
I just sneak one, I do not need another.

231
00:22:43,136 --> 00:22:47,915
I need answers. I want to know who killed my parents.

232
00:22:52,056 --> 00:22:53,927
Stop here. No stations nearby.

233
00:23:45,548 --> 00:23:50,222
No light, must be in the storm last night.

234
00:23:53,755 --> 00:23:55,417
Are you sure you wanna do this?

235
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:57,019
Yup.

236
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:00,819
Okay. Where is the basement?

237
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:03,096
This way.

238
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:22,013
I think it's there.

239
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:32,794
So Perfect.

240
00:24:37,236 --> 00:24:38,939
Be right back.

241
00:25:41,703 --> 00:25:44,738
Mom. ¡Mami!

242
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,025
... I will not be the last.

243
00:26:05,103 --> 00:26:08,982
I know who the murderer.

244
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:15,741
Am I the only one who knows!

245
00:26:16,635 --> 00:26:19,019
The murderer is ...

246
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,474
¡Presente!

247
00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:29,572
I almost did not recognize her. -to Who?

248
00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:37,381
My mom. It is the first time I hear this.

249
00:26:40,227 --> 00:26:43,968
All right.

250
00:27:09,926 --> 00:27:10,930
Come On! Come On!

251
00:27:20,268 --> 00:27:21,143
What happened?

252
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:22,820
Someone broke my window.

253
00:27:23,607 --> 00:27:26,119
It should be a warning. Damn It!

254
00:27:26,406 --> 00:27:27,292
The police!

255
00:27:29,328 --> 00:27:30,582
Stay down.

256
00:27:44,573 --> 00:27:47,631
Hi, I was told that you have a great note for me.

257
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:50,923
Do you want to put on my land?

258
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:54,177
Call me at the station if you return before 10.

259
00:27:54,213 --> 00:27:58,614
Then I'm in the air again. Goodbye Bye.

260
00:28:43,236 --> 00:28:46,024
Gabriel, what do you do? Go to sleep.

261
00:28:46,788 --> 00:28:50,859
Mami, the woman of the house looks at me all the time.

262
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:53,638
-It Does not move. -go To bed.

263
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,392
There is no woman there.

264
00:29:16,264 --> 00:29:22,223
Yes there is. He is looking. It is a black lady.

265
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:27,398
Sorry to call so late, Mr. Ferriday. But I was not.

266
00:29:27,435 --> 00:29:31,018
We had a board meeting. I'll talk to you ...

267
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:33,216
... About the girl that got away.

268
00:29:33,357 --> 00:29:34,926
Aura Petruscu.

269
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:38,416
Dr. Judd, the clinic does not need the publicity.

270
00:29:38,453 --> 00:29:43,301
Let me, Mr. Ferriday. I'll find her.

271
00:29:45,231 --> 00:29:47,556
My head.

272
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:52,697
They took me head!

273
00:30:08,657 --> 00:30:09,239
Hello

274
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:13,213
I was thinking to go home tonight.

275
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:16,559
No, not tonight, Grace.

276
00:30:16,594 --> 00:30:18,086
Do not you want me?

277
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:26,745
There is another person here. He's sleeping in the other room.

278
00:30:26,885 --> 00:30:28,475
Is it someone I know?

279
00:30:29,588 --> 00:30:35,652
No, it's just a girl who did not know where to spend the night.

280
00:30:35,689 --> 00:30:40,074
Good-bye, then. Grace.

281
00:31:31,825 --> 00:31:32,865
He said I was anorexic.

282
00:31:35,607 --> 00:31:36,614
I would not have imagined.

283
00:31:36,858 --> 00:31:40,809
Do not beat yourself. Anorexics keep their secrets.

284
00:31:40,845 --> 00:31:43,568
Behave, hide their problems.

285
00:31:44,331 --> 00:31:47,872
Are you serious? What else?

286
00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:52,382
Well, they are very attached to an unstable mother.

287
00:31:53,354 --> 00:31:56,948
They are upper middle class girls. Boys too.

288
00:31:56,984 --> 00:31:58,944
In general they are the brightest and artistic.

289
00:31:59,604 --> 00:32:03,248
What else? How could I forget? Sex.

290
00:32:03,284 --> 00:32:06,331
What about sex? Did you sleep with her?

291
00:32:06,367 --> 00:32:07,726
Annie is just a child.

292
00:32:07,762 --> 00:32:09,997
-Same, Did you? -Do Not!

293
00:32:10,033 --> 00:32:13,689
I thought so. Anorexics are afraid of sex.

294
00:32:13,726 --> 00:32:17,368
Want to go back to his childhood. A when there was fear.

295
00:32:17,405 --> 00:32:19,430
There are about 8 million patients.

296
00:32:19,882 --> 00:32:20,944
How do you know all this?

297
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,009
Why Talk-Shows looked like everyone else.

298
00:32:24,045 --> 00:32:25,523
I do not look.

299
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:26,922
There's your problem.

300
00:32:27,204 --> 00:32:31,273
This is television! You can not go well and ...

301
00:32:31,517 --> 00:32:34,742
You should see it and eat it.

302
00:32:34,779 --> 00:32:36,961
This is a way to let anorexia.

303
00:32:38,348 --> 00:32:41,472
Seriously. Your friend may be in danger.

304
00:32:41,509 --> 00:32:44,571
Many anorexics die. Commit suicide.

305
00:32:45,438 --> 00:32:47,611
The worst is that she will not leave your help.

306
00:32:47,855 --> 00:32:50,389
She wants your help but leave you.

307
00:32:51,464 --> 00:32:53,409
How did you get that?

308
00:32:53,764 --> 00:32:55,622
Problems with parents.

309
00:32:55,658 --> 00:32:58,532
Are said to have a recurring dream ...

310
00:32:58,568 --> 00:33:00,992
... Where his father were about to kiss.

311
00:33:14,795 --> 00:33:17,072
Concaliaconmisia.

312
00:33:23,945 --> 00:33:25,363
Teliapolytheus

313
00:37:20,109 --> 00:37:21,584
Talk to you soon ...

314
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:29,128
Grace, ¿me perdonas?

315
00:37:29,165 --> 00:37:31,115
That girl is just a name?

316
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:32,202
Yup.

317
00:37:32,893 --> 00:37:34,770
I do not see very safe.

318
00:37:34,806 --> 00:37:36,705
Believe me, I do not hide anything.

319
00:37:36,741 --> 00:37:38,628
Are you coming to dinner tonight?

320
00:37:39,899 --> 00:37:41,482
Maybe, maybe.

321
00:37:43,698 --> 00:37:44,512
Hola como andas?

322
00:37:44,776 --> 00:37:48,770
David, are you? I continue to see that scene in my mind

323
00:37:50,372 --> 00:37:52,945
Well, I'm back. Do you need anything?

324
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:55,240
No, I recently ate

325
00:37:56,069 --> 00:37:59,658
-for Real? -Yup. And you do not know the mess I left in the kitchen.

326
00:37:59,664 --> 00:38:03,458
I made roast chicken and chips.

327
00:38:03,732 --> 00:38:08,200
Now I feel full, I'm tired and want to go to sleep

328
00:38:08,201 --> 00:38:10,821
Aura, I'm a little worried about you.

329
00:38:11,007 --> 00:38:12,752
No, do not tell me that.

330
00:38:12,788 --> 00:38:14,982
See you soon. Chau.

331
00:38:30,293 --> 00:38:32,870
Just cook the food. There must be some progress.

332
00:38:33,218 --> 00:38:36,126
No, you're probably lying, David.

333
00:38:36,175 --> 00:38:39,075
They are not easy to cure. So many die.

334
00:38:43,158 --> 00:38:44,984
Many anorexics commit suicide.

335
00:38:48,985 --> 00:38:51,000
There are about 8,000,000 of them.

336
00:38:57,329 --> 00:38:59,560
Very attached to an unstable mother.

337
00:39:02,485 --> 00:39:05,985
It will dream that his father is about to kiss her.

338
00:40:11,522 --> 00:40:14,262
-what Was that? Not heard anything.

339
00:40:15,094 --> 00:40:16,022
I'll see.

340
00:40:29,264 --> 00:40:32,315
-what Was it? -he Left.

341
00:40:32,708 --> 00:40:36,013
So? I'll go for it.

342
00:40:36,129 --> 00:40:39,883
Do not be ridiculous. You can not shoquear so easily.

343
00:40:39,945 --> 00:40:42,459
Let Grace. It's just a girl.

344
00:40:42,495 --> 00:40:45,499
Te is exploding. As everyone else.

345
00:40:46,367 --> 00:40:49,489
Believe me Grace. Need help. It wants to commit suicide.

346
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:52,495
It was in the damn clinic Ferriday whole last month.

347
00:40:52,589 --> 00:40:54,783
Does the Ferriday clinic? You Joke.

348
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,375
The mistreated. But he escaped.

349
00:40:58,002 --> 00:41:01,970
It is a manipulative crazy. Let her go.

350
00:41:02,661 --> 00:41:04,242
Fuck you, Grace.

351
00:41:04,321 --> 00:41:09,756
David, David. Damn It!

352
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:36,574
Sorry about last night. Do not want to leave.

353
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,745
Are you angry with me?

354
00:42:39,075 --> 00:42:43,870
-Not, do you are you? No, I'm not angry.

355
00:42:43,907 --> 00:42:46,213
Good, because I have to go to work.

356
00:42:47,229 --> 00:42:47,908
I because?

357
00:42:48,568 --> 00:42:51,231
Because I have to pretend to be a normal person.

358
00:42:53,486 --> 00:42:59,808
Go to the market and buy fruits and vegetables that you like.

359
00:43:00,572 --> 00:43:04,648
Ok T. I'll make a delicious meal.

360
00:44:11,598 --> 00:44:14,740
Watching TV will get everything.

361
00:44:14,776 --> 00:44:18,951
The 18, 23 and 29. Do not you realize?

362
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,811
... Only God kills when it rains.

363
00:44:26,453 --> 00:44:28,016
Stay away from the rain.

364
00:44:29,618 --> 00:44:32,752
If you wait. A time.

365
00:44:32,789 --> 00:44:35,114
It is for you, your new girlfriend.

366
00:44:39,717 --> 00:44:44,030
David, went to the market and saw Dr. Judd.

367
00:44:44,274 --> 00:44:45,215
He followed me and I ...

368
00:44:46,455 --> 00:44:50,276
No, let me go!

369
00:45:07,472 --> 00:45:08,642
Will Get?

370
00:45:11,637 --> 00:45:12,542
¿Aura? Are you there?

371
00:45:17,321 --> 00:45:18,292
Will Get?

372
00:45:21,029 --> 00:45:22,357
He is not here.

373
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,058
How do you know that is not here?

374
00:45:25,415 --> 00:45:31,886
I was worried about you and her.

375
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:35,193
You yourself said he wanted to commit suicide.

376
00:45:36,137 --> 00:45:40,311
So I did what any responsible person.

377
00:45:42,228 --> 00:45:47,510
I called Ferriday. They will know help her.

378
00:45:47,547 --> 00:45:49,036
Did you call the clinic?

379
00:45:49,263 --> 00:45:55,326
I hope you're happy!

380
00:46:01,869 --> 00:46:04,777
I did not think would meet again so soon.

381
00:46:05,048 --> 00:46:09,649
Is it because I'm charming?

382
00:46:09,685 --> 00:46:15,001
You can go. Miss. Petruscu is an old friend.

383
00:46:16,492 --> 00:46:21,846
Aura is alone now and I must take care.

384
00:46:21,882 --> 00:46:26,113
All up to you.

385
00:46:26,149 --> 00:46:29,536
If you're willing to see inside you ...

386
00:46:29,573 --> 00:46:32,610
... And face the past.

387
00:46:32,646 --> 00:46:36,376
You are not interested in me. Want something more.

388
00:46:36,413 --> 00:46:39,702
I want you to get better. That I want.

389
00:46:39,739 --> 00:46:45,087
But the secret is there.

390
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:47,512
Do not worry.

391
00:46:49,146 --> 00:46:52,569
I'll reveal one thing.

392
00:46:52,615 --> 00:46:58,997
The head of each human being contains the soul ...

393
00:46:59,034 --> 00:47:03,215
... The only puzzle that is the universe.

394
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:07,596
Look inside your head. Opens memory.

395
00:47:08,572 --> 00:47:13,486
And the universe will open as a map.

396
00:47:16,487 --> 00:47:21,829
Aura, do you see this?

397
00:47:25,021 --> 00:47:27,456
It will help you remember everything.

398
00:47:28,121 --> 00:47:29,081
What is it?

399
00:47:29,118 --> 00:47:33,503
A very rare arrears. A psychotropic very strong.

400
00:47:33,743 --> 00:47:35,854
It is a drug. I do not want drugs.

401
00:47:35,994 --> 00:47:38,348
It is not a drug. Work with memory.

402
00:47:38,653 --> 00:47:42,229
Clears obstacles.

403
00:47:43,209 --> 00:47:48,295
Do not worry. Come on, take it.

404
00:47:48,331 --> 00:47:55,470
Squeeze Mulberry teeth and drink the juice.

405
00:47:55,471 --> 00:47:56,951
No, I beg you.

406
00:47:58,907 --> 00:48:06,720
That's it. Now squeeze it.

407
00:48:06,756 --> 00:48:09,904
The power of your brain and your imagination ...

408
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:13,217
... They are stronger than a volcano.

409
00:49:02,052 --> 00:49:05,151
Carry on.

410
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:33,466
Now I remember. It was you.

411
00:49:34,484 --> 00:49:36,739
Carry on.

412
00:49:39,057 --> 00:49:41,176
I do not want to.

413
00:49:55,611 --> 00:50:03,137
His face ... behind the heads of mommy and daddy.

414
00:50:03,173 --> 00:50:06,404
The face of who? You saw her.

415
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:09,841
The face of who, Aura?

416
00:50:09,877 --> 00:50:13,855
-I Did not see anything. 'Do I think.

417
00:50:13,892 --> 00:50:15,641
It's the truth.

418
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:29,367
Damn It!

419
00:50:41,275 --> 00:50:46,275
Take her to her room.

420
00:50:46,277 --> 00:50:49,580
No, leave me alone.

421
00:50:54,581 --> 00:50:56,684
Denlen painkillers.

422
00:51:00,677 --> 00:51:03,753
Please let me go.

423
00:52:40,678 --> 00:52:41,831
Responds you.

424
00:52:44,012 --> 00:52:46,485
Please do not.

425
00:52:50,253 --> 00:52:55,898
Try not to move. Should metérta vein.

426
00:52:59,865 --> 00:53:03,616
Save you I can hurt your arm. Be good.

427
00:53:09,142 --> 00:53:10,587
Good night.

428
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:14,503
Come On.

429
00:53:14,539 --> 00:53:18,528
Stay still.

430
00:53:24,287 --> 00:53:26,122
Be still treasure.

431
00:53:40,028 --> 00:53:41,481
Okay. That's it.

432
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:16,070
Looking for Aura Petruscu. What room are you?

433
00:55:16,106 --> 00:55:19,551
I can not give you that information.

434
00:55:19,587 --> 00:55:21,380
In addition, visiting hours are over.

435
00:55:22,607 --> 00:55:23,870
All right.

436
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:37,729
Where were you? I do not want to hear excuses.

437
00:55:37,853 --> 00:55:40,892
It was in service ...

438
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:31,478
Keys.

439
00:56:34,013 --> 00:56:34,472
God.

440
00:58:25,977 --> 00:58:29,360
It's me. Are you okay?

441
00:58:29,396 --> 00:58:31,180
Me drogaron.

442
00:58:33,981 --> 00:58:37,953
'Where did you get? -The Stole.

443
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:44,790
Wait here. Are you going to be okay?

444
00:58:44,827 --> 00:58:50,911
I'll see what happens. Stay here.

445
00:59:20,821 --> 00:59:38,193
You. did it! You. did it!

446
00:59:38,229 --> 00:59:40,035
Let's get outta here!

447
01:00:47,512 --> 01:00:50,811
Tonight, the Ferriday clinic was the scene ...

448
01:00:50,847 --> 01:00:53,254
... A series of horrific beheadings.

449
01:00:53,290 --> 01:00:57,624
Aura, Aura, come here.

450
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:01,321
They killed anyone in the Ferriday clinic. I knew it!

451
01:01:01,357 --> 01:01:03,978
It was ... my nurse.

452
01:01:04,074 --> 01:01:04,899
Are you sure?

453
01:01:06,648 --> 01:01:12,086
He worked with Dr. Judd. She was the one who shot me.

454
01:01:12,122 --> 01:01:14,679
Did you hear something? Did you see anything? -Do Not.

455
01:01:25,866 --> 01:01:28,757
Wherever you go, people die.

456
01:01:29,417 --> 01:01:33,305
Come on, you're not responsible for their deaths.

457
01:01:33,341 --> 01:01:35,367
The director of the clinic, Dr. Leopold Judd ...

458
01:01:35,403 --> 01:01:37,477
... Was not available for comment.

459
01:01:37,514 --> 01:01:41,749
You're not a killer. You're a thief.

460
01:01:41,785 --> 01:01:45,317
On the local scene, the weather is improving.

461
01:01:45,551 --> 01:01:49,167
-what Is this? -The Keys to the nurse.

462
01:01:51,803 --> 01:01:53,211
It's all my fault.

463
01:01:59,381 --> 01:02:04,937
"Marigold" I know that place. Is a deposit.

464
01:02:15,823 --> 01:02:19,263
It's time to turn off the TV and go to bed.

465
01:02:19,423 --> 01:02:21,657
I want you're sleeping for when you arrive.

466
01:02:22,796 --> 01:02:25,082
Not afraid to go to sleep alone. Do Not?

467
01:02:25,437 --> 01:02:30,199
No, Mommy. Good-bye, I love you.

468
01:03:31,863 --> 01:03:34,783
He had his head.

469
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:38,893
I did not see anything. It's the truth.

470
01:03:53,263 --> 01:03:54,717
Maybe the police were already here.

471
01:03:54,753 --> 01:03:58,165
It is not possible. How will you know about this site?

472
01:03:58,202 --> 01:04:01,845
They're going to find. You see something in the house Hilda ...

473
01:04:01,882 --> 01:04:06,887
... A key or a receipt. Let's not waste our time.

474
01:04:10,104 --> 01:04:15,089
Seven years ago this home is rented by the same person.

475
01:04:15,328 --> 01:04:20,770
And sometimes they come here they can count on the fingers of one hand.

476
01:05:01,466 --> 01:05:03,327
The police! Let'S Get Going! Come on now!

477
01:05:07,517 --> 01:05:10,480
Wait, the key! That's grip police.

478
01:05:11,884 --> 01:05:15,582
Mira. This is strange. They're all dead.

479
01:05:16,865 --> 01:05:22,527
OMG ... she is dead. She and her too.

480
01:05:22,564 --> 01:05:26,223
"Dear Hilda, in memory of the crazy times we had ...

481
01:05:26,342 --> 01:05:28,145
... With Love, Linda "

482
01:05:28,701 --> 01:05:30,450
She must be Linda.

483
01:05:32,082 --> 01:05:35,525
"Linda Quirk. 992, calle Benton."

484
01:05:35,561 --> 01:05:39,506
He lives near here. At least alive when they took the picture.

485
01:05:39,527 --> 01:05:41,068
What is this?

486
01:05:43,354 --> 01:05:46,161
Looks like a badge.

487
01:05:46,405 --> 01:05:48,952
I think he is the murderer. The Doctor.

488
01:05:49,715 --> 01:05:51,844
How do you know? She could be the killer.

489
01:05:51,845 --> 01:05:53,919
Not likely.

490
01:05:54,371 --> 01:05:56,389
Do not know what a murderer.

491
01:05:56,425 --> 01:06:04,143
I'll give this to the police ... anonymously.

492
01:06:04,699 --> 01:06:07,007
Tomorrow will be too late.

493
01:06:10,832 --> 01:06:16,085
Alice knew. Also Katherine and Georgia ...

494
01:06:16,121 --> 01:06:17,838
... Why I have so much fear.

495
01:06:17,874 --> 01:06:19,168
All we were stuck in that.

496
01:06:19,204 --> 01:06:21,388
-in What? -In An accident.

497
01:06:22,288 --> 01:06:23,822
Before you met me?

498
01:06:25,384 --> 01:06:30,146
ECT was my specialty.

499
01:06:31,111 --> 01:06:32,696
Was treatment of shock?

500
01:06:33,252 --> 01:06:35,785
I thought I knew all about it.

501
01:06:36,654 --> 01:06:39,052
Including how to make people forget everything.

502
01:06:39,977 --> 01:06:46,102
Quirk, Quirk ... there it is.

503
01:06:46,138 --> 01:06:50,039
Is L. Quirk. But there is another street.

504
01:06:50,116 --> 01:06:52,610
But what did you do?

505
01:06:52,646 --> 01:06:55,842
Something horrible.

506
01:06:58,056 --> 01:07:02,183
I do not know how we free ourselves from this.

507
01:07:06,023 --> 01:07:07,848
-Hello. -¿Linda Quirk?

508
01:07:07,885 --> 01:07:12,230
A time. It is a type. Question for you.

509
01:07:17,374 --> 01:07:19,798
-Hello. I'm looking for Linda Quirk.

510
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:22,234
I because? Who is speaking?

511
01:07:22,686 --> 01:07:24,865
Know Hilda Volkman?

512
01:07:28,946 --> 01:07:30,659
He hung up.

513
01:07:30,695 --> 01:07:32,346
Try again.

514
01:07:48,617 --> 01:07:50,009
It's her.

515
01:07:52,582 --> 01:07:53,520
We'd better go there.

516
01:07:55,879 --> 01:07:59,999
-there Is it. -are Them.

517
01:08:08,952 --> 01:08:10,741
Come here! Come here!

518
01:08:10,777 --> 01:08:14,896
-What wants rays? Just want to talk.

519
01:08:45,003 --> 01:08:50,252
Damn, do not see it. -Doblemos Left.

520
01:08:52,614 --> 01:08:54,382
I go to the right.

521
01:09:10,107 --> 01:09:13,266
Damn, we lost! -turn Around.

522
01:09:43,819 --> 01:09:46,205
There it is. In the parking lot.

523
01:09:46,242 --> 01:09:48,648
I knew.

524
01:09:54,967 --> 01:09:56,260
-he Needs something?

525
01:09:56,297 --> 01:10:01,984
I'm looking for a lady who came earlier.

526
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:03,086
Does your name?

527
01:10:03,642 --> 01:10:05,274
Quirk. Linda Quirk.

528
01:10:05,310 --> 01:10:07,747
We have no registered with that name.

529
01:10:07,783 --> 01:10:09,435
I wonder, he said he'd be here.

530
01:10:09,471 --> 01:10:12,879
Probably still not arrived. Want a room?

531
01:10:13,105 --> 01:10:24,054
Ah, sí, Maclin Edd, 140,
Weyslon Street, Onkpark.

532
01:10:24,090 --> 01:10:26,796
I want a room overlooking the parking lot.

533
01:10:26,833 --> 01:10:28,242
¿When parking?

534
01:10:28,278 --> 01:10:30,376
Yup.

535
01:10:35,322 --> 01:10:37,462
Did I notice it's there?

536
01:10:38,089 --> 01:10:39,733
Do not let.

537
01:10:45,886 --> 01:10:47,474
From here we can watch her.

538
01:10:47,822 --> 01:10:50,715
Do you think it will rain?

539
01:10:52,475 --> 01:10:55,470
It's a beautiful day. Sure not.

540
01:10:59,258 --> 01:11:00,558
Linda? Are you?

541
01:11:00,594 --> 01:11:02,047
Thank God you're okay.

542
01:11:02,084 --> 01:11:06,450
I'm in a hotel. I want you to come now.

543
01:11:06,486 --> 01:11:09,822
Peace Out. React too strong.

544
01:11:09,859 --> 01:11:13,654
Were just kids. They did not seem dangerous.

545
01:11:13,691 --> 01:11:15,175
You are very Influenced as.

546
01:11:15,211 --> 01:11:18,158
I do not know who they were. I just know I'm in danger.

547
01:11:18,195 --> 01:11:20,309
And you too if you're in my house.

548
01:11:20,346 --> 01:11:22,255
Please come here.

549
01:11:22,291 --> 01:11:25,717
Better call the police.

550
01:11:25,753 --> 01:11:27,628
Discuss this when you arrive.

551
01:11:27,665 --> 01:11:29,972
All right. Where are you?

552
01:11:30,008 --> 01:11:34,003
In Hopkins House. Room 301. Near the airport.

553
01:11:36,223 --> 01:11:38,057
-I'm Going there. -be Careful.

554
01:12:40,236 --> 01:12:43,583
-¿David? -What's The matter?

555
01:12:43,931 --> 01:12:47,530
Nothing, just wanted to know if you were there.

556
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:04,985
-I Sure do. Well, now go.

557
01:13:05,021 --> 01:13:06,139
I because?

558
01:13:06,175 --> 01:13:08,565
Because I do not want to get wet.

559
01:13:24,426 --> 01:13:27,283
Hi, yes, to rise.

560
01:15:38,322 --> 01:15:40,594
Be ...

561
01:15:41,939 --> 01:15:44,760
Lloyd.

562
01:16:07,178 --> 01:16:10,661
-¿El Doctor Lloyd? Do you still work here?

563
01:16:11,009 --> 01:16:13,823
No, it was long ago.

564
01:16:13,859 --> 01:16:19,667
But he returned a few years ago and looked terrible.

565
01:16:20,777 --> 01:16:26,121
He fled with medicine clinic, if I understand.

566
01:16:26,469 --> 01:16:29,721
Yes I understand. Do you know where can I find it?

567
01:16:29,757 --> 01:16:34,065
The last I heard of him is that he lived in the district of deposits.

568
01:16:34,101 --> 01:16:36,964
You can search bars.

569
01:16:37,831 --> 01:16:39,183
Good thanks.

570
01:17:00,355 --> 01:17:03,137
She's Hilda Volkman. Worked here.

571
01:17:04,836 --> 01:17:06,413
And Linda Quirk.

572
01:17:06,449 --> 01:17:10,192
Harry, I know who are women. Who is he?

573
01:17:10,228 --> 01:17:13,782
Dr. Lloyd. What curious.

574
01:17:13,818 --> 01:17:17,720
A guy just now came with the same photo.

575
01:17:17,756 --> 01:17:19,110
What did you say to him?

576
01:17:19,146 --> 01:17:21,105
I sent it to the warehouse district.

577
01:18:07,287 --> 01:18:08,983
Want something?

578
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:10,031
Are you Dr. Lloyd?

579
01:18:10,067 --> 01:18:12,643
Perhaps I was in another life.

580
01:18:12,705 --> 01:18:14,113
Do you have money?

581
01:18:14,149 --> 01:18:18,210
No, but Linda Quirk, Hilda Volkman, ...

582
01:18:18,247 --> 01:18:19,563
... Did these names sound?

583
01:18:19,599 --> 01:18:21,345
¿Katherine Duran? ¿Georgia Jackson?

584
01:18:21,382 --> 01:18:24,054
-leave Me alone. They're dead. Did you know?

585
01:18:24,091 --> 01:18:25,754
People die every day.

586
01:18:25,790 --> 01:18:28,353
'They were decapitated. I what?

587
01:18:28,764 --> 01:18:31,190
I said we were beheaded.

588
01:18:31,434 --> 01:18:35,557
God ... that's not my fault.

589
01:18:35,594 --> 01:18:38,708
Let Doctor Lloyd. You must tell me something.

590
01:18:38,744 --> 01:18:39,880
It is too late.

591
01:18:40,872 --> 01:18:42,374
You must know something.

592
01:18:42,410 --> 01:18:46,188
Do Not! Leave me alone!

593
01:18:48,907 --> 01:18:52,220
This is my phone. Call me if you change your mind.

594
01:22:43,590 --> 01:22:45,768
This used to be a nice neighborhood.

595
01:22:46,892 --> 01:22:52,459
That's all I had, a phone number: David.

596
01:22:57,104 --> 01:22:58,020
What's this?

597
01:23:07,269 --> 01:23:10,684
I'm here. I'll take you back.

598
01:23:13,113 --> 01:23:20,343
Aura, come with me.

599
01:23:22,409 --> 01:23:41,494
'What happens there! Enough! Help me!

600
01:24:35,062 --> 01:24:39,865
I used to love her. I used to love her.

601
01:24:56,895 --> 01:24:59,102
Come see this.

602
01:25:01,002 --> 01:25:03,572
Stay there, you can not pass.

603
01:25:04,024 --> 01:25:06,062
Come on, muévase.

604
01:25:06,099 --> 01:25:07,612
All right.

605
01:25:42,476 --> 01:25:43,979
"Dear David, went to join with my mom ...

606
01:25:44,431 --> 01:25:48,452
... Forgive Me. I'll always love. "

607
01:25:51,689 --> 01:25:54,831
Aura returns!

608
01:26:14,622 --> 01:26:16,500
¿Aura? Go Back!

609
01:26:20,250 --> 01:26:23,250
Will Have !. Will Have !.

610
01:27:28,837 --> 01:27:30,370
Sálvenla.

611
01:27:30,406 --> 01:27:33,368
-what Does he say? I think "Save her"

612
01:27:33,405 --> 01:27:34,983
A little late for that.

613
01:27:35,019 --> 01:27:39,170
Sálvenla, sálvenla.

614
01:27:39,669 --> 01:27:43,233
The terror of "Hunting-Heads" that threatened the city ...

615
01:27:43,270 --> 01:27:45,551
... Ended this morning when an old Cadillac ...

616
01:27:45,587 --> 01:27:50,352
... Crashed near Lake Veronica.

617
01:27:50,388 --> 01:27:54,517
The driver, Dr. Leopold Judd, died on the spot ...

618
01:27:54,553 --> 01:27:57,088
The severed heads of all his victims ...

619
01:27:57,124 --> 01:27:59,241
... Were in the trunk of his car.

620
01:27:59,278 --> 01:28:03,288
Ben Aldridge was there and spoke with the police.

621
01:28:03,948 --> 01:28:06,388
Captain Travis, Will the Doctor Judd was the murderer?

622
01:28:06,424 --> 01:28:10,342
The evidence we found it connects to the murders.

623
01:28:10,379 --> 01:28:11,564
What was his motive?

624
01:28:12,431 --> 01:28:15,977
Looks like he was obsessed with para-Normal.

625
01:28:16,684 --> 01:28:18,708
Other than that I see no other reason.

626
01:28:18,745 --> 01:28:20,057
Will they continue with the investigation?

627
01:28:20,829 --> 01:28:22,797
As far as I am concerned, this case is now closed.

628
01:28:24,785 --> 01:28:26,884
What led to the brilliant psychologist Leopold Judd ...

629
01:28:26,921 --> 01:28:32,675
... Specialist anorexia and chief clinical Ferriday ...

630
01:28:32,711 --> 01:28:34,330
... To commit these crimes?

631
01:28:35,830 --> 01:28:37,746
What they had in common victims?

632
01:28:37,990 --> 01:28:41,767
¿Shared secret that met ...

633
01:28:41,804 --> 01:28:43,224
... In this sad fate?

634
01:28:43,261 --> 01:28:45,831
These and more are the questions ...

635
01:28:45,867 --> 01:28:48,863
... To be made in our special report.

636
01:28:48,899 --> 01:28:53,081
But one thing is clear. The nightmare is over.

637
01:29:22,975 --> 01:29:24,568
Grace Hannigton, please.

638
01:29:27,804 --> 01:29:30,319
Grace, me, David.

639
01:29:32,201 --> 01:29:34,034
I need some recipes.

640
01:29:35,540 --> 01:29:37,281
Let's Grace.

641
01:29:39,376 --> 01:29:43,979
Please only two, please.

642
01:29:44,692 --> 01:29:50,975
All right.

643
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:37,785
His back $ 19.

644
01:30:46,886 --> 01:30:49,741
-Be Thank you.

645
01:30:51,457 --> 01:30:55,322
Mike, come. This requirement is false.

646
01:30:55,489 --> 01:30:56,734
Hey boy.

647
01:31:01,996 --> 01:31:05,767
This requirement is false. Give it back.

648
01:31:05,804 --> 01:31:08,800
-Devuélvelo 'Go to hell.

649
01:31:29,229 --> 01:31:31,174
You deserve fucking junkie.

650
01:32:24,931 --> 01:32:29,461
Hey, did you see a girl going through a dark covered?

651
01:32:33,455 --> 01:32:39,497
You Sure? Come on, you can trust me.

652
01:33:02,296 --> 01:33:06,724
Sorry, sought another person.

653
01:33:06,903 --> 01:33:09,732
Someone wearing a bracelet.

654
01:35:40,867 --> 01:35:42,377
What a jerk.

655
01:35:49,946 --> 01:35:55,104
Aura, Aura.

656
01:36:01,872 --> 01:36:02,832
What thing is this?

657
01:36:51,273 --> 01:36:55,543
Did you think that was Aura? Was just me.

658
01:36:55,722 --> 01:36:57,209
You wanted to see Aura.

659
01:37:16,579 --> 01:37:24,124
Aura ... I knew you would see.

660
01:37:25,769 --> 01:37:27,854
Do not wanna see you do this.

661
01:37:28,076 --> 01:37:30,386
Where are we? -In My mom's house above.

662
01:37:34,387 --> 01:37:35,387
How did we get up?

663
01:37:36,922 --> 01:37:39,001
-is Alive? -Yup.

664
01:37:40,103 --> 01:37:42,800
God, where is it now?

665
01:37:42,859 --> 01:37:47,030
Side Up. Fast. Fast.

666
01:37:48,537 --> 01:37:49,836
No time.

667
01:38:00,324 --> 01:38:01,425
What are you doing?

668
01:38:02,483 --> 01:38:03,966
Chaining the door.

669
01:38:06,944 --> 01:38:08,378
In work.

670
01:38:08,830 --> 01:38:10,987
At least let's try fucking.

671
01:38:19,909 --> 01:38:21,350
¿David?

672
01:38:32,731 --> 01:38:36,931
I do not understand. I thought your mother was dead.

673
01:38:37,018 --> 01:38:38,818
La seen decapitated, ¿no?

674
01:38:38,854 --> 01:38:46,287
I saw a body. But it was not her. It was a neighbor.

675
01:38:48,133 --> 01:38:49,322
Oh my God.

676
01:38:49,938 --> 01:38:52,304
He faked his own death.

677
01:38:53,421 --> 01:38:59,556
I should have realized. He was ahead of me.

678
01:38:59,940 --> 01:39:03,862
In the dark it looked like someone had two heads.

679
01:39:03,898 --> 01:39:08,266
But it was only one, my father.

680
01:39:09,561 --> 01:39:12,147
He was sure that Judd had killed your mother.

681
01:39:12,545 --> 01:39:16,750
No, he never killed anyone.

682
01:39:17,808 --> 01:39:20,741
But he knew who the killer:

683
01:39:23,284 --> 01:39:24,238
My mom.

684
01:41:06,974 --> 01:41:12,092
Help! Somebody help us!

685
01:41:12,128 --> 01:41:14,885
Help us to leave the house!

686
01:41:17,097 --> 01:41:19,704
I can not believe your mother killed those people.

687
01:41:19,740 --> 01:41:20,693
Yes it did.

688
01:41:20,729 --> 01:41:24,000
Are you sure killed your father? -Yup!

689
01:41:25,295 --> 01:41:28,445
I because? I because?

690
01:41:31,947 --> 01:41:33,463
Here he comes.

691
01:41:42,451 --> 01:41:43,935
Take the chain.

692
01:41:46,527 --> 01:41:47,260
Do not do it.

693
01:41:48,394 --> 01:41:51,215
Do not let your mother outside.

694
01:41:54,156 --> 01:41:55,000
Never hurt you. You know that.

695
01:41:55,001 --> 01:41:56,800
I can not hear you.

696
01:41:58,341 --> 01:42:00,704
I will never hurt you.

697
01:42:02,567 --> 01:42:08,550
Open this door. Take the chain.

698
01:42:09,106 --> 01:42:19,201
Take it out! Take it out now!

699
01:42:31,229 --> 01:42:33,248
Why do you do this?

700
01:42:46,633 --> 01:42:49,798
After the others, I thought I would stop.

701
01:42:49,835 --> 01:42:53,730
-Please Please. -Why He killed?

702
01:42:53,766 --> 01:43:00,971
Porque... Nicholas... Nicholas.

703
01:43:05,919 --> 01:43:08,105
Push, push.

704
01:43:08,675 --> 01:43:11,115
We have problems. Scalpel. Scalpel.

705
01:43:26,669 --> 01:43:29,192
He beheaded the baby!

706
01:43:50,356 --> 01:43:54,701
Animals! Animals!

707
01:43:58,145 --> 01:44:00,073
Let Dr. Contrólese.

708
01:44:03,133 --> 01:44:08,750
Bastards! Bastards! Killer Beasts!

709
01:44:14,630 --> 01:44:16,594
Say yes.

710
01:44:20,053 --> 01:44:26,757
Murderer! Miserable! Farsante!

711
01:44:39,895 --> 01:44:42,817
They believed they could make me forget everything.

712
01:44:44,431 --> 01:44:45,969
But Nicholas ...

713
01:44:47,164 --> 01:44:51,814
... He asked me to die their murderers.

714
01:44:52,151 --> 01:44:54,610
So I obeyed.

715
01:44:55,283 --> 01:44:56,744
Now you know my secret!

716
01:44:57,864 --> 01:45:00,688
Do Not! I beg you!

717
01:45:44,650 --> 01:45:47,124
Ms. Petrescu. I want to ask some questions.

718
01:45:53,596 --> 01:45:55,655
Get these damn reporters here.

719
01:45:59,986 --> 01:46:04,203
Did you know Dr. Judd? Can you tell me something about it?

720
01:46:05,378 --> 01:46:06,904
Does Dr. Judd?

721
01:46:07,462 --> 01:46:09,323
Dr. Judd.

722
01:46:15,456 --> 01:46:17,235
Did you work with your mother?

723
01:46:19,199 --> 01:46:20,286
Worked.

724
01:46:23,345 --> 01:46:25,153
