1
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,130
-The things you lose,
 you don't ever get back.

2
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,510
It can never happen again
 except in the smudgy carbon

3
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,280
copy of memory.

4
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,150
There are things that seem
 irreconcilable that you

5
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,970
must find a way
 to reconcile with.

6
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,530
The simple passage of days
 tells the sharpness of the pain,

7
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:14,590
but never quite wears it out.

8
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,760
And it doesn't get
 washed away with time.

9
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:22,570
It becomes a cold hard
 lump of something,

10
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,850
and a loseable souvenir.

11
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,910
Donny once told me,
 there's no future

12
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,740
in holding on to the past.

13
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,720
-I've never taken
 the train before.

14
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,890
-I used to come up
 almost every weekend.

15
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,050
-With Tony?

16
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,640
-Um-hmm.

17
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,080
Haven't been up
 for almost a year.

18
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,190
-Oh, Lyle called.

19
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,760
He's bringing a friend.

20
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,230
-He didn't say he was
 bringing a friend when

21
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:57,540
I talked to him Thursday.

22
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,120
-Well, maybe it's a new friend.

23
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,530
-Lyle comes up here, John,
 to get away from his friends.

24
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,310
He's certainly not going
 to bring one with him.

25
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:10,130
-Well, he is today on the 1140.

26
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,670
-He hasn't been up
 all summer, and then

27
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:17,900
to come up this weekend and
 bring someone, it seems odd.

28
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,120
-What is so special
 about this weekend?

29
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,270
-It's the anniversary
 of Tony's death.

30
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,290
You think Lyle's forgot?

31
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,760
-Of course not.

32
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,680
-You did.

33
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,500
-Tony wasn't my lover.

34
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,000
-Nope.

35
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,400
He was your brother.

36
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,250
-He was my half
 brother, actually.

37
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,530
-Are we there yet?

38
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,000
-Soon.

39
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,270
-You know, you have ugly feet.

40
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:37,790
-Don't.

41
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,920
It's cold.

42
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,880
-Feet, in general,
 are pretty ugly,

43
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,780
but yours are especially ugly
 if you look at them closely.

44
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,000
-Well, then don't
 look at them closely.

45
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,710
-Anything gets uglier
 the more you look at it.

46
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,090
-Not true.

47
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,800
-Name one ugly
 thing that gets more

48
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,010
beautiful if you
 look at it closely.

49
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,500
-Insect.

50
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,130
-Actually, I like your feet.

51
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,720
They're genuine.

52
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,390
Old World.

53
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:17,840
Biblically even.

54
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,930
-Do that again.

55
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,630
My Old World feet liked it.

56
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,100
-Come on in, you'll
 get used to it.

57
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,970
-Mission accomplished?

58
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,320
-Hey.

59
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,590
-I did my part.

60
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,750
-Yes, but did John do his?

61
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,740
-Let's just hope
 he did something.

62
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,700
And a cheer.

63
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,480
-Do you make love
 differently when

64
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,480
you're trying to get pregnant?

65
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,060
-I forgot what it's like
 to make love and try

66
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,070
not to get pregnant.

67
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,860
-Was that a mating schedule I
 saw stuck on your refrigerator?

68
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,700
-That is not on
 the refrigerator.

69
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,220
That's on top of
 the refrigerator.

70
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,160
You snooped.

71
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,140
-Oh, god, I feel no
 desire to procreate.

72
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,510
-I prefer the idea
 of having a ward

73
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,120
a la Dick Grayson in Batman.

74
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,580
-It's hot out here.

75
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,950
I wish I'd brought
 my bathing suit.

76
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:32,030
-I don't have mine on.

77
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:34,990
-You never have yours on.

78
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:35,700
-Take off your dress.

79
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,520
Come here, get naked.

80
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,970
To be naked is to be oneself.

81
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:44,480
-I'm not getting nude
 in front of this one.

82
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,390
-No, no, nude is set on
 display, but a naked body

83
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,180
reveals itself without disguise.

84
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,710
-Oh, for Christ's sake.

85
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,300
You two are impossible.

86
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,210
OK, if this goes out
 in the refrigerator,

87
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:05,180
I'll kill you both.

88
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:05,680
Duh-duh-da-duh.

89
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,350
-What should I do about beds
 for Lyle and his friend?

90
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,140
One or two?

91
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,360
Are they sleeping together?

92
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,830
-Didn't ask.

93
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:22,100
Two and leave it to them.

94
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,140
-Different rooms?

95
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,700
-The same room should be fine.

96
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,480
-Lyle always sleeps
 in the yellow room.

97
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,360
-Things are about
 to change with Lyle.

98
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,080
Mustn't let it upset you?

99
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,990
-Wouldn't matter.

100
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:43,930
LAURA (OFFSCREEN):
 Perspective is

101
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,290
nothing but a scientific fact.

102
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:49,180
If it disturbs you, ignore it.

103
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:53,670
My husband's disdain for
 perspective was legendary.

104
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,200
Something of a disadvantage
 in an architect.

105
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,600
I'm such a moron.

106
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,240
I'm making you
 sound like one, too.

107
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,990
You made so much more
 sense in life, darling,

108
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:13,000
than you do in death.

109
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,950
OK, that's gotta go.

110
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,780
That does, too.

111
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,900
-Nina, if your
 mother's so awful,

112
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,720
why have we come all this way
 to spend the weekend with her?

113
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,550
I didn't say she was awful.

114
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,370
-You did.

115
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,920
Since we left the
 city three hours ago.

116
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,010
You've done nothing
 but criticize her.

117
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:36,420
You know how precious
 our free time is.

118
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:36,920
Hmm.

119
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,160
We could have been in
 Santa Monica by now.

120
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,830
-Yeah, but I'm not
 in Santa Monica.

121
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:47,930
-Neither is your mother.

122
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,060
-I thought you might
 like some iced tea.

123
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:50,900
-Thank you.

124
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,860
-If you don't mind
 my asking, why

125
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,230
don't you just sweep those up?

126
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,320
-They burst and stain the patio.

127
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,170
-Oh.

128
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,700
Well, there really is a reason
 for everything, isn't there?

129
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,360
I have plenty of
 time for small talk.

130
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,510
-It took forever for
 us to find this place.

131
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,920
-Nina.

132
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,270
How lovely to see you.

133
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,040
Though it would have been
 more wonderful if I'd known

134
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,550
you were coming.

135
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,020
-Well, it was one of those
 spur of the moment things,

136
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,920
you know, like getting married.

137
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,830
This is Thierry by the way.

138
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:21,330
-Hello.

139
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,170
-[SPEAKING_FRENCH]

140
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,380
-Then this is--

141
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,790
-Jerry, how are you?

142
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,020
-Fine, Jerry, how are you?

143
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:27,750
-Jerry drove us up.

144
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,780
I thought it would be a
 lot cheaper than a cab,

145
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,030
but it wasn't.

146
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,390
-Oh, how much do I owe?

147
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:33,890
-$300?

148
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,330
-I also told him he could
 have a swim in the pool.

149
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,910
-Well, certainly.

150
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:41,530
Certainly.

151
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:44,640
I'm sure we have a spare
 pair of Speedos somewhere.

152
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,310
The people I rented this house
 from moved out in such a hurry,

153
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:50,180
you'd be surprised
 what they left behind.

154
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:54,780
-Well, it certainly is a bitch
 to get to, but it's lovely.

155
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,310
-I'm not supposed
 to get too much sun.

156
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,190
I'm playing a prostitute.

157
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,840
-Are you an actor, too, Theirry?

158
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,900
-No, I train the
 pigeons in this movie.

159
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,270
-The pigeons?

160
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,450
-Thierry can get a pigeon
 to do almost anything.

161
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,210
-Yeah.

162
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,690
Uh, we use to use
 carrier pigeons,

163
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,180
but they're all extinct.

164
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,930
So now we use street pigeons.

165
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:32,870
They're so much easier to
 use than the common cairns

166
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,370
and herring goals
 that we used when

167
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:38,110
we did the remake of
 Hitchcock "Birds" with Nina.

168
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,540
-I played a topless dancer
 who gets pecked to death

169
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,760
by a chicken.

170
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,660
-Great film.

171
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:50,020
-I don't think I saw that one.

172
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,220
-Well, you told me you did.

173
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,840
My mother thinks
 that all film people

174
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,900
are hypocrites, especially me.

175
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,580
-That's not true,
 Nina, and I'm very

176
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,040
proud of everything you do.

177
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,440
-Why is it that every time you
 pat me on the back, mother,

178
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,870
it feels like there's
 a knife in your hand?

179
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,840
I hope there's no
 chlorine in the pool.

180
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,920
I'll get a rash.

181
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,420
-Well, you are
 playing a prostitute.

182
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,000
-What have you
 done to your hair?

183
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,680
-Cut it.

184
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,850
-Oh, you look great.

185
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:31,130
-I am great, thanks to--

186
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,400
-So you're the reason we
 haven't seen Lyle all summer,

187
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,570
and here he's trying
 to convince us

188
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,340
that he's been working
 on book number two.

189
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,070
Have you read his book, Robert?

190
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,060
-Actually, no.

191
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,850
Lyle won't let me read it.

192
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,660
I think he's afraid
 it might scare me off.

193
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,010
-Oh, well, it might.

194
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:49,700
It stopped me from painting,
 but it's a wonderful book.

195
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,600
-Which has only just come
 out in paperback, so I really

196
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,030
don't need to write a
 second book now, do I?

197
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,890
I work at the museum, and
 traveling almost every weekend.

198
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:57,680
-Oh, poor baby.

199
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,970
And I might as well exploit
 my celebrity while I can.

200
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:00,620
-Your what?

201
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,760
-On a very small scale.

202
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,260
That's all I meant.

203
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,800
Oh, god, Tony would have been
 mortified to see you celebrate.

204
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,470
-Not exploit it?

205
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,060
-Celebrate it.

206
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,630
-So how are you?

207
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,130
-Fine.

208
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:24,090
I mean, it's been a bit muggier
 than usual, but I'm fine.

209
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,520
-How are you?

210
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,130
-So how long have
 you lived up here?

211
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:36,460
-Oh, um, we moved up here
 for good two years ago.

212
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:39,220
It used to be more
 of a weekend retreat.

213
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,170
-Hmm, a debauchery.

214
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,660
-Are you hot back there, Robert?

215
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,810
-Oh, I'm fine, thanks.

216
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,640
So do you miss New York?

217
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,170
-Sorry?

218
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,240
-Do you miss New York?

219
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,680
-Um, sometimes, but it's easy
 enough to get into the city

220
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,220
if you want.

221
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,420
Although with little
 Rowland, that's

222
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,550
become a thing of the past.

223
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,910
-How is little Rowland?

224
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,410
-Fine.

225
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:11,350
He's at home helping
 John with his wall.

226
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,910
-His wall?

227
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:15,660
-His wall.

228
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,220
John is building a stone
 wall at the edge of the lake.

229
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,170
-That's interesting.

230
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,120
-What for?

231
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,500
-Oh, who knows what
 goes on in his mind.

232
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,320
[BABY CRYING]

233
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,480
-Rowland, hey,
 what are you doing?

234
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,430
John?

235
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,140
-Uh, John, John.

236
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:31,830
Hey, buddy.

237
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,160
I want you to meet Robert.

238
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,860
-How are you?

239
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,360
-Good, John.

240
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,710
-Hey, Rowland.

241
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,410
-The sticks.

242
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,160
I can't believe you
 actually live here.

243
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,370
-I'd like to leave sometimes.

244
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,630
-John, you were supposed
 to be watching him.

245
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,270
-I was.

246
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,280
He was about to stick
 a wicket in his eye.

247
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,260
-Are you helping
 Daddy with his wall?

248
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,230
-How did you know about that?

249
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,040
-I told him.

250
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,110
-It's supposed to be a surprise.

251
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,040
-Decorative or functional?

252
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,620
Which one is it?

253
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,840
-You have to wait and see.

254
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,840
-I don't want to wait and see.

255
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,420
-All right, come
 on, let's go down.

256
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,250
Robert, you want to come?

257
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:57,750
-Sure.

258
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,090
-Maybe Robert would
 like to freshen up

259
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:01,320
first and save the
 surprise for later.

260
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,260
-I don't mind.

261
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,120
-Yeah, come on.

262
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,820
It's just down there.

263
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,320
-You don't have to be
 polite up here, Robert.

264
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,250
Why don't we take your bags,
 and I'll get you a beer?

265
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,530
-Whatever.

266
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,030
-Nice to meet you, John.

267
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,610
-Nice to see you, too.

268
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:15,540
-Look at this.

269
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,040
Wow.

270
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,370
-So how long have
 you known Robert?

271
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,720
-Three weeks.

272
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,580
I met him at an artist
 colony in Maine.

273
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,550
Skowhegan, do you know it?

274
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,000
-You're dating a painter?

275
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,970
-Not me.

276
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:32,460
Paintings dead, man,
 haven't you read my book?

277
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,140
-I guess that makes being an art
 critic a hell of a lot easier.

278
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,490
-The best thing about
 Maine, apart from meeting

279
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,620
Lyle is I got to paint all day.

280
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:45,000
I don't really have
 that luxury in New York.

281
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,270
-Why not?

282
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,060
-Can't afford it.

283
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:50,090
-But as an artist, you
 can't really afford not to.

284
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:52,840
-Well, I'll remember that the
 next time I can pay my rent.

285
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,180
That was meant to
 sound encouraging.

286
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,240
Do you like children, Robert?

287
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,610
-Uh, I like their
 hands and their feet.

288
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,750
-Well, that's a start.

289
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,070
-Oh, no, sorry.

290
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,280
I don't drink beer.

291
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,300
-Um, we have wine.

292
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,800
-Uh, water would be great.

293
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,300
-Hmm.

294
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,300
Water's coming up.

295
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,840
-Thanks.

296
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,640
-So what do you paint?

297
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,020
-Contemporary landscapes.

298
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:24,100
-Oh, any insights on shopping
 malls and parking lots?

299
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,710
I'll get you a glass.

300
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:30,250
-Uh, well, I paint what I see
 and hope it's significant.

301
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,640
Lyle said you were
 a painter, too.

302
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,140
-Did he?

303
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,790
Well, that's more than
 he's ever said to me.

304
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,470
It's more of a hobby these days.

305
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,890
I don't think that
 there's anything

306
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:42,070
I have to say that
 hasn't been said before.

307
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,180
-Come on, how do you know?

308
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,930
You silence the artist, and
 you silence the most articulate

309
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:47,300
voice that people have.

310
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,130
-Well, let's just take
 your bags upstairs

311
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,540
and think about that one.

312
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,750
-Oscar Wilde.

313
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,750
I don't know what year though.

314
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,430
-Hmm, very Donna Reed.

315
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,120
-Oh.

316
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,900
Don't be nostalgic for the 50s.

317
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,730
They were terribly drab.

318
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:03,870
-Really?

319
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:04,960
Even with you in them?

320
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,530
-Yes, even so.

321
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,480
-Oh, Mom, not too
 much sugar, please.

322
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,730
Some of us have careers
 that depend on how we look.

323
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:14,140
-Oh, I don't know, I think
 you could use a few pounds.

324
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:14,640
-Butter?

325
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,850
-In the refrigerator.

326
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,150
-So, what do you want to
 do about dinner tonight?

327
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:23,130
-Well, actually, I'm going out.

328
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,550
-But you have me
 and Thierry tonight.

329
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:28,350
-Well, I have you and Thierry
 all day tomorrow, too.

330
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,380
-But we've come all
 the way up here.

331
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,650
-Listen, darling, I
 wouldn't have even accepted

332
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:35,140
this invitation if I'd known
 you were going to show up.

333
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,400
But you haven't for the
 last six weeks, so you know,

334
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,620
it seemed really
 foolish to expect you.

335
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,680
-And now that I am
 here, you're going out.

336
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,180
Perfect.

337
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,980
It's only for a few hours.

338
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,760
It's not exactly a
 criminal offense.

339
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,730
Besides, you'll have Thierry.

340
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,580
You won't even notice I'm gone.

341
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,620
-So are you having dinner with?

342
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,440
Do you remember Iris Kerr?

343
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,440
That beautiful American
 woman who lived in Rome?

344
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,470
-The drunk?

345
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:03,650
-Uh, I prefer to
 remember her beauty.

346
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:04,150
-Perspective.

347
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,000
-True.

348
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,540
Well, it's her son and his wife.

349
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,650
They live up here.

350
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,110
-Tony Kerr is married?

351
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,220
-No, it's not Tony.

352
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,670
It's the other one.

353
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,010
John.

354
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:17,330
-Tony Kerr was the most
 gorgeous man I had ever met.

355
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,480
I wanted to go to his
 leverage energy to him.

356
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,950
-Hmm, did you?

357
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:22,900
-Nope.

358
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:27,080
He broke my heart, not my hyman.

359
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,070
He likes boys.

360
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,550
-Uh, where'd you get the idea?

361
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:41,330
-I just started building it.

362
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:44,210
-You're not worried about it
 collapsing or falling down?

363
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,520
Didn't use any mortar, did you?

364
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,290
-It's not meant to
 last forever, Lyle.

365
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:05,450
-Ah, it's the most
 beautiful place on earth.

366
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:08,030
-Then you should
 visit it more often.

367
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:11,510
-I will now.

368
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,470
-Robert seems nice.

369
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,010
-He is nice.

370
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:18,640
He's the most instinctively
 nice person I've ever met

371
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,160
and he's lovely.

372
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,920
-Is he the first since Tony?

373
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:36,500
What's it like being
 with somebody new?

374
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,250
I haven't had sex
 since I got married.

375
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:45,330
I mean, I mean, with
 anyone other than Marian.

376
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:48,870
-The first time
 Robert and I had sex,

377
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:54,440
I wake up early in the morning,
 and I just watched him sleep.

378
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,020
And I thought if you
 unwound this boy,

379
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:03,200
you would find nothing bad,
 nothing rotten or unnecessary.

380
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,460
Just everything
 down to the bone.

381
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,840
Perfect and clean.

382
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:14,360
-Ah, so is it romantic
 or just sexual?

383
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,000
-I'm going to put you and
 Lyle in the yellow room.

384
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,200
Oh, I hate to refer
 to rooms by the color,

385
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,990
but it's something
 we do up here seeing

386
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,140
as the rooms are
 different colors.

387
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,070
-Colors.

388
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:26,570
-Yellow.

389
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:33,200
-This is such a beautiful room.

390
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,160
-Thank you.

391
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:45,920
-You know, in India, Hindu
 women often decorate their homes

392
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,490
with brightly colored
 rice paste paintings

393
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:52,300
in the hope of persuading the
 goddess of love to stop by.

394
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,750
-Wow.

395
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,520
Are you Indian?

396
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,650
-My father is.

397
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,560
He lives in Delhi.

398
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,940
He's a counterfeitor.

399
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,400
-Ooh, how exotic.

400
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,880
What does he counterfeit.

401
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,140
-Anything that will
 make him a lot of money.

402
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,640
-And your mother?

403
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,700
-Was American.

404
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,560
She, uh, died when I wasn't
 much older than Rowland.

405
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,820
-Oh, I'm sorry.

406
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:19,810
-That's OK.

407
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:22,200
So I went to live with
 my grandparents in LA

408
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,490
when I was 10.

409
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:25,090
-LA?

410
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:25,660
oh my god.

411
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,330
Ultra shock.

412
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:30,900
-Well, I wasn't very happy
 with my father, so it's OK.

413
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,950
I don't think he liked
 the way I turned out.

414
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:37,610
-What, that you're a painter?

415
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:39,560
-OK.

416
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,760
-Oh.

417
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,660
-Would you be happy
 if Rowland was gay?

418
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,290
-Well, if he was happy.

419
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:49,280
-You wouldn't be happy first?

420
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,950
I mean, you'd wait for him to be
 happy and then you'd be happy.

421
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:55,820
-I haven't really
 given it much thought.

422
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,640
I think it's a bit premature.

423
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,670
-Oh, I'm sorry.

424
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,270
-That's all right.

425
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,810
I'll just leave
 you to settle in.

426
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:02,310
-Thanks.

427
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:09,430
-There are times when you think
 no one is actually look at you

428
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,300
when you have a quality I
 can only describe as sexy.

429
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:29,300
Oh, god, I'm exhausted.

430
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,640
I could fall asleep.

431
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,140
-No!

432
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,500
No, don't fall asleep.

433
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,870
Talk to me.

434
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:39,580
Is John a good lover?

435
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,790
-You shouldn't ask me
 questions like that.

436
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:42,790
-Why not?

437
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,290
-Because.

438
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:47,290
-Why are people always to
 reluctant to talk about sex?

439
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:49,420
It's intimate, Tony.

440
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,990
-I used to have a crush on John.

441
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:58,990
-He's your brother.

442
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:01,080
-I was 10.

443
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,160
Oh, lord, well, I trust
 you've gotten over it.

444
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,270
-It was just a phase.

445
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,440
He doesn't seem
 sexy to me anymore.

446
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,390
-Is Lyle a good lover?

447
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,760
-Sex isn't a high
 priority with Lyle.

448
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,580
-Is it with you?

449
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:30,050
-I like sex, and Lyle doesn't?

450
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,890
Not as much as me.

451
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:34,870
-Is that a problem?

452
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,860
-No.

453
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:40,540
When I travel sometimes,
 I fool around.

454
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:45,400
-Does Lyle know you do this?

455
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,710
-We don't really talk about it.

456
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,350
-Does Lyle have other lovers?

457
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,120
-No.

458
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,920
We're happy together.

459
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,820
That's the important thing.

460
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:02,590
-What's it like to fool around?

461
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:05,480
-Why do you want to know?

462
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,010
Deep down, you're just like me.

463
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,880
It's the chase, not the catch.

464
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,810
Sometimes I think I
 should have married you.

465
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,300
I'm serious.

466
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:28,350
I've never felt that
 way about anyone.

467
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:32,090
Before me and Lyle,
 and you and John,

468
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:35,460
we were lepers in the same spot.

469
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:38,000
Always kissing the last
 person you'd expect.

470
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,420
-Isn't there a
 danger that you could

471
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,990
fall in love with
 one of your liaisons.

472
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,600
And there's nothing
 stopping it from happening?

473
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:03,800
-It doesn't happen.

474
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,560
-No, as long as you're safe.

475
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,820
-It's a little late for that.

476
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,060
-What did you just say?

477
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,060
How long have you known?

478
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,270
-A couple of years.

479
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,620
-Why didn't you tell me?

480
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,630
-I decided I wouldn't tell
 anyone until it mattered.

481
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,030
Except Lyle.

482
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,020
I'm sorry.

483
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:40,850
-Oh, you're healthy.

484
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,450
-Like an ox.

485
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:43,960
Or is it a horse?

486
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,680
I can never remember.

487
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,050
-It's a horse.

488
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,400
I think we should go back now.

489
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,240
-Oh, stay a bit with me.

490
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:17,130
-I need a beer.

491
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,970
Oh, you.

492
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:35,610
Send Lyle with the rowboat.

493
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,430
-Nina.

494
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:57,930
-What?

495
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:58,920
-Your mother.

496
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,900
-So you're working on your book.

497
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:09,610
-Oh, arranging and
 rearranging notes mostly.

498
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:11,730
I'm writing a book
 about, well, I

499
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:15,880
should say I'm working on a
 biography of my late husband.

500
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,390
-One of her late husbands.

501
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:17,890
Yes?

502
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:18,580
-The latest.

503
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,980
It's Atorian Ponti.

504
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,180
Maybe you've heard of him.

505
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:25,460
He was quite a
 celebrated architect.

506
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,650
-No, I don't think so.

507
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:28,930
-Not that celebrated, obviously.

508
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:31,390
-Oh, the first time I saw
 a building he designed,

509
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:34,490
I was actually speechless.

510
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:36,500
The book is not
 going well, however.

511
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,980
Biographies.

512
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,990
They can make the most
 thrilling lives seem banal.

513
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,740
It's just much more
 interesting trying

514
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,370
to get his whole life
 on paper when I was--

515
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,840
-Giddy with widowhood?

516
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,270
-Yes.

517
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,710
Yes.

518
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,150
Exactly.

519
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,360
-May I see?

520
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:56,950
-Oh, yes, please.

521
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:04,980
-Do I at least rate a mention?

522
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,240
-Oh, of course.

523
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,610
Atorian loved you as if
 you were his own daughter.

524
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,310
-Which is why he sent me
 away to boarding school.

525
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:14,540
-Nina, you begged to
 go to boarding school.

526
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,440
You said all of your
 friends were going.

527
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,240
-I was 12, Mom.

528
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,490
I also wanted to be one
 of Charlie's Angels.

529
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:21,590
You know, she
 didn't even want me

530
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:25,060
to call her mother in
 public, only Laura,

531
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,930
as if we were friends.

532
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:29,640
-Well, you never seemed
 particularly interested in me

533
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,140
as a mother.

534
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,360
I thought perhaps you'd
 prefer me as a friend.

535
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,170
-I had plenty of friends.

536
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:36,710
-You certainly did, and you
 were with them all of the time.

537
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,320
You never even came
 home on vacation.

538
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,860
-Well, I wasn't ready
 to be paraded around

539
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,220
as one of your precious
 little accessories.

540
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:46,740
-You know, about a year
 after she'd gone to school,

541
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:50,720
Atorian and I went to a party,
 and someone asked how she was.

542
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,980
And I remember thinking, oh,
 oh, Nina, yes, that's right.

543
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,820
I have a daughter.

544
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,150
I'd put her clean
 out of my head.

545
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,390
-Your life.

546
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,610
-If we expect nothing
 from our children,

547
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:04,620
and they expect nothing from
 us, nobody will be disappointed.

548
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,900
-Hmm, only lonely.

549
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:10,450
-It's very beautiful.

550
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:14,810
One or another is lost since
 we fall apart endlessly,

551
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:17,370
in one motion depart
 from each other.

552
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:22,680
-D.H. Lawrence was
 Atorian's favorite poet.

553
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,610
And that so sums up the
 way I feel about him.

554
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:27,890
At least writing about him.

555
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:32,390
How are we ever supposed to know
 what a person's really like?

556
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,460
Maybe it's impossible.

557
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,320
Maybe they just
 keep sliding away

558
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,140
like water changing
 all the time.

559
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:46,340
-To be celebrated is nothing,
 but to be loved is everything.

560
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:51,540
-Oh, my mother was less inspired
 when my father passed away.

561
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:54,550
She sent a card.

562
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:57,320
-Well, I just had so
 little to say about him.

563
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:02,020
I mean, the whole relationship
 was such a whirlwind,

564
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,590
[FRENCH] I think
 you say in France.

565
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,460
-[FRENCH] yes.

566
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:10,260
-A sudden, exhilarating
 leap into the void.

567
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,250
-Well, I should have looked.

568
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:14,790
Within a year he had
 me under a pedestal.

569
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:17,200
And in the end, the only
 thing that we had in common

570
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,190
was Nina, which, of course,
 made it all worthwhile.

571
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:24,430
Well, I must say it was
 fund while it lasted.

572
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,560
I swear he had a
 hand with 20 fingers,

573
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,040
and it was always on my ass.

574
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:45,990
-I was going to spend the day
 at Wilbur Robinson's house.

575
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:50,750
And Wilbur is my best
 friend, and his house

576
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:53,780
is the greatest place
 in the world to visit.

577
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:04,430
It's kind of dull around
 here today, said Wilbur.

578
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:11,040
And I looked around, Aunt Billy
 was playing with her train set,

579
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,200
cousin Pete was
 walking the cats.

580
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:19,940
And Uncle Gaston sat comfortably
 in the family county.

581
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:24,490
-It's so odd having
 a child, Lyle.

582
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:25,790
I keep thinking when
 he learns to talk,

583
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:27,790
he's going to tell me everything
 that's on that little mind,

584
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,330
and I'm going to
 know him entirely.

585
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,890
We never know anyone
 like that, do we?

586
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:36,160
-How well did our
 parents know us?

587
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:41,840
-But you'll tell Mommy what
 you're thinking, won't you?

588
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,320
-Don't do it.

589
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:43,820
-Huh?

590
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:46,000
Tell me what's on your mind?

591
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:51,280
Aw, are you thinking
 you're stinky?

592
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,750
Because I do.

593
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:55,320
Or are you thinking
 you want Uncle

594
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,570
Lyle to change your
 diaper, are you?

595
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:00,800
-Oh, there are limits to
 Uncle Lyle's devotion.

596
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:07,150
-Oh, actually, he's warm.

597
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:11,510
Here, just run this
 under some cold water.

598
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:14,100
Hey, honey, hey.

599
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,590
Hey.

600
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:19,080
Hey.

601
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:22,070
-Here you go.

602
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,560
-Hello, happy one.

603
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:32,250
-You know, towards
 the end, I used

604
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,880
to pray that Tony's
 illness would just turn him

605
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,180
into a baby, and
 then he wouldn't

606
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:40,410
know what was happening to him.

607
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:41,320
-But he did.

608
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:46,620
That's what he wanted.

609
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,500
-I never knew what Tony wanted.

610
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,630
It should be easier than
 changing a grown man,

611
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:56,270
don't you think?

612
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:06,170
-I think I'm more afraid of
 being sick than I am of dying.

613
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:08,570
It's too abstract for me.

614
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:12,830
I can't imagine
 dying or being dead.

615
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:16,910
But I can imagine being sick.

616
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:18,060
I don't mind dying,
 you see, it's

617
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:21,700
just the preliminaries I hate.

618
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:25,310
I can feel it coming, I think.

619
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:27,290
-What do you feel?

620
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:31,910
-Just scared.

621
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:36,370
Being sick in a
 way that makes me

622
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:37,860
feel like it's
 already happening.

623
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:50,260
And if I died now, on a gorgeous
 day like today, with you here,

624
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:53,770
my life would have ended well.

625
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:54,660
I love you.

626
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:28,920
-What are you doing
 in here all alone?

627
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,380
Are you being
 mysterious or exclusive?

628
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:37,510
-Enigmatic.

629
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:39,520
-Where's Lyle?

630
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,440
-He's upstairs asleep.

631
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,120
It's amazing how exhausting
 indolence can be.

632
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,190
And Marian?

633
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:52,390
-I think she's
 checking on Rowland.

634
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,250
-Tony was my half brother.

635
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:57,950
We had the same mother.

636
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:00,490
He used to get all the girls.

637
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:02,530
The only problem was
 he didn't want them.

638
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:10,560
Well, I'd better get cleaned up.

639
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,670
Um, I just wanted to say
 that Marian and I are

640
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:18,650
very pleased that
 you're here, Robert.

641
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:22,070
And very happy to
 see you with Lyle.

642
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:24,040
-Thanks, John.

643
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:27,790
I mean, maybe it should
 be awkward with Robert.

644
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:31,940
-Is it?

645
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,660
-Well, I can't
 pretend it doesn't

646
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,070
make me feel a
 little uncomfortable.

647
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:57,830
This last year has
 been unbearable.

648
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:01,430
There were times I wish I'd had
 the strength to commit suicide.

649
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,360
I guess if I'd had the strength,
 I wouldn't have felt the need.

650
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,640
But even at my most
 desperate, I always

651
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,700
thought something
 wonderful my happen.

652
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,330
It wasn't optimism.

653
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:17,520
It was just a respect
 for the possible.

654
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,470
And then this boy walks into my
 life, and I feel human again.

655
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:28,510
And I just wanted to
 share that with you.

656
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:31,820
-Well, now, I feel awful.

657
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:32,320
-Good.

658
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:38,320
-How could I not say
 anything, because that

659
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,860
would be dishonest.

660
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:43,220
And you know me
 too well for that.

661
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,290
And you are my best friend.

662
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:57,230
-I don't know why I always feel
 like whispering when I'm here.

663
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:02,070
The first time I saw this
 place, I nearly cried.

664
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:04,030
-Well, you were always more
 sentimental about nature

665
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:05,710
than people.

666
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:09,200
-Well, God is in nature.

667
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,250
-And truth is in wine.

668
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:13,270
-Thierry seems very nice.

669
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:14,740
-He's married.

670
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,740
-Oh.

671
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:20,020
Well, the nicest
 men often are, which

672
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:25,030
probably means that they aren't
 quite as nice as they appear.

673
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:26,630
-You never let that stop you.

674
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:33,430
-Did you know he was married
 when you first met him?

675
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:35,500
-It slipped his mind.

676
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,400
-Yeah.

677
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,050
His wife lives in France?

678
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:40,830
-Santa Monica.

679
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,030
Yeah, it's not really a
 matter of distance though.

680
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,150
It really is lovely here.

681
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,660
-Isn't it?

682
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:55,050
-You know it's
 beautiful in Italy, too.

683
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:57,390
Have you thought any more
 about that offer I made you?

684
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:59,010
-What would I do in Italy?

685
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:00,810
-They make movies
 in Italy, Nina.

686
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:01,950
-Yeah, in Italian.

687
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:03,140
-You speak Italian.

688
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,870
-Used to.

689
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:09,270
So is, uh, Tony's
 brother good looking?

690
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:11,500
-I don't really
 remember, you know.

691
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,150
He's just very, very quiet.

692
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:20,370
His personality doesn't really
 quite extend out to its edges.

693
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:22,800
His wife speaks her mind though.

694
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,040
-They sound awful.

695
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,510
-No, they really aren't so bad.

696
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:26,700
They're just not his type.

697
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,330
-You sound like such a snob.

698
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:31,090
-Hey, you're the one that
 said they sounded so awful.

699
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:32,310
-Can we go back now.

700
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:35,120
I think I've have enough
 beauty for one day.

701
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:35,620
-OK.

702
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,310
-What do you think of Robert?

703
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:52,600
-He's nice enough.

704
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,460
He's young.

705
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:55,960
How are you going to cook these?

706
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:58,070
-We're going to saute them.

707
00:43:58,070 --> 00:43:58,970
-Hmm.

708
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,760
-I don't like him.

709
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,700
-Why not?

710
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:04,520
-Just something about him.

711
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:07,900
-It must be hard for
 him coming up here.

712
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:11,710
So well in being
 so closed to Tony.

713
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:13,020
-Oh, I understand that.

714
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:15,290
It's just, I don't
 buy his enthusiasm.

715
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:19,770
He seems presumptuous
 or judgmental.

716
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:30,040
-Aren't you being just a
 little judgmental yourself?

717
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,260
-We can't help but form
 impressions of people, can we?

718
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,610
I don't think it will last.

719
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:50,260
-Well, then you should be nice.

720
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:52,230
If he's just something
 that Lyle's going through,

721
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:53,600
you probably won't
 have to see him again.

722
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:56,700
-Yeah.

723
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,590
-A turban?

724
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:11,060
-I thought we could use
 a little ammunition,

725
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:13,950
I hope that thing works.

726
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:16,650
-Don't you have somewhere to go?

727
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:17,200
-I'm Italian.

728
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:21,220
I'm expected to be late.

729
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:22,940
-You know, I always
 thought that a grudge

730
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:24,880
would make a person ugly.

731
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,090
But that isn't true
 in your case, is it?

732
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:30,360
Strange.

733
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,970
-You can go anyplace
 in the world

734
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:33,940
and some things remain constant.

735
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:37,010
The sun goes up,
 the moon comes down

736
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:41,600
and children resent
 their parents.

737
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,660
-You wear too much
 makeup, Mother.

738
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:46,520
In this light, you look
 like a beautiful prostitute.

739
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:49,850
-You know, one thing that
 is disturbing about children

740
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:52,520
is that they can always see
 right through their parents.

741
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:55,050
What they don't realize,
 is their parents

742
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:58,950
can see right through them back.

743
00:45:58,950 --> 00:45:59,900
-Nina, take the wine.

744
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:03,740
You're too much.

745
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:05,690
-It doesn't matter, Thierry.

746
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:06,890
I should get going anyway.

747
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:08,410
-You look very beautiful.

748
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:09,220
-Thank you.

749
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:10,450
-Have a nice evening.

750
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:10,970
-Thank you.

751
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:41,550
-Hey.

752
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:43,030
-Hi.

753
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:43,530
-Hi.

754
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:44,510
How are you?

755
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,480
I'll be done in just a minute.

756
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:54,860
-Where did Tony die?

757
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:55,360
-What?

758
00:46:58,330 --> 00:47:02,770
-It was here in this
 house, wasn't it?

759
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:07,570
-Robert, I don't think
 that's a question to really--

760
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:09,530
-True.

761
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:11,360
-Robert, it doesn't matter.

762
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:14,020
Of course, it fucking matters.

763
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:16,440
-Robert, please.

764
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:16,970
-Tell me.

765
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:32,730
-Jesus.

766
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:34,540
-My daughter, Nina,
 came up from the city

767
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:36,880
unexpectedly, so it kind
 of slowed things down.

768
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:37,430
-Hello.

769
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:37,930
-Hello.

770
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:39,040
-You remember my husband?

771
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,040
-Yes, how are you?

772
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,650
-You should have brought
 your daughter with you.

773
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:46,170
-Yes, I-- oh, my word.

774
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:47,240
What lovely paintings.

775
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,470
-Yes, Marian painted them.

776
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:50,400
-Really?

777
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,520
Well, if you cook half
 as well as you paint,

778
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,240
we're in for a rare treat.

779
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,740
-Can I get you
 something to drink?

780
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,380
-Absolutely.

781
00:47:58,380 --> 00:47:59,120
-Red wine?

782
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,430
-Red, please.

783
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:01,860
-OK.

784
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:04,120
-Now what should we
 do about Nina, is it?

785
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,440
-Oh, nothing, she's just fine.

786
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,730
She's here with her fiance.

787
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:08,100
-Well, you should have
 brought them both.

788
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,220
-Why don't you give them a call?

789
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,200
-Well, it's very
 kind of you, but they

790
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,490
don't have a car, actually.

791
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:14,470
-Then I'll pick them up.

792
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:16,260
The more the merrier, huh?

793
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,630
-Thank you.

794
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:18,130
-Cheers.

795
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:19,210
-Cheers.

796
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:19,710
-Cheers.

797
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:43,090
Oh, it's a wonderful house.

798
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:44,500
Just wonderful.

799
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,080
Although, it does
 have that renty

800
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,920
feeling as if it
 suspects me of not having

801
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,170
committed myself
 to it fully yet.

802
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:53,990
-Well, then it must be nice for
 you that Nina's made it out.

803
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:55,870
-Yes, it really is.

804
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:58,930
Though, it's a little
 disturbing to have

805
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:02,420
someone just for the weekend.

806
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:05,410
Just beginning to enjoy their
 company, you turn around,

807
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:07,330
and they've gone again.

808
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:08,030
-More weekend guests.

809
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:08,820
Sorry about that.

810
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:11,310
You're really not
 guests, you're family.

811
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:14,170
-No, I'm the guest,
 and I'm glad.

812
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:15,650
Thank you for having me.

813
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:17,410
-Well, you're welcome.

814
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:18,720
Laura Ponti, this is Robert.

815
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,780
-Hello, how are you?

816
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:21,690
-Pleasure.

817
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:25,020
-Lyle, nice to meet you.

818
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:27,240
Laura's daughter, Nina, and her
 fiance are up for the evening,

819
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,550
so John's just gone
 to pick them up.

-[SPEAKING_FRENCH]

821
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:47,210
-What happened to that martini?

822
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:48,890
-Shh.

823
00:49:48,890 --> 00:49:50,840
-So how long are you two up for.

824
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,130
-Just the weekend.

825
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:53,980
We go back tomorrow.

826
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:55,930
-Morning.

827
00:49:55,930 --> 00:49:58,480
-I thought we were going
 to have a lazy day.

828
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:02,100
-I wish I could, but I have
 to work tomorrow evening.

829
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,970
-Oh, it's a shame you
 have to go back so soon.

830
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:06,870
It's such a beautiful weekend.

831
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:09,540
My daughter came in
 from the city today,

832
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,270
and she just
 practically drove me

833
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:12,620
crazy with all her urban energy.

834
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:14,930
-You bastard!

835
00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:16,130
-Be reasonable, Nina.

836
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:17,050
-Reasonable?

837
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:19,710
You call your fucking wife
 from my mother's telephone,

838
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:22,400
and you've got the nerve to
 tell me to be reasonable?

839
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,430
Well, you should
 have thought of that

840
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:27,190
before you decided to spend
 the weekend fucking me.

841
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,470
-Hello?

00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:28,970
Hello?

00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:29,720
-Oh, Christ.

844
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:32,410
Whatever it is, I
 don't live here.

845
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:33,650
-You must be Nina.

846
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:35,680
The name's Kerr, John Kerr.

847
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:43,660

00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:45,030
Tony's brother.

-Yeah.

850
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:47,670
-What does she do?

851
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:48,660
-She's an actress.

852
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:51,160
She's making a
 movie in the city.

853
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:51,840
-Oh, what is it?

854
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,930
Maybe we've heard of it.

855
00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:55,380
-Oh, I was afraid
 you'd ask me that.

856
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,460
I haven't any idea.

857
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:01,440
She does quite a lot of stuff,
 mostly in action and horror

858
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,640
films, which means
 she has to bare

859
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,910
her breasts before she's killed.

860
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:11,590
-My wife, Marian, wanted to
 ask you both over for dinner.

861
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:15,590
We tried to call, with
 the line was busy.

-But, uh, I'd be delighted.

865
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:25,940
I actually liked
 all of her movies.

866
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:27,280
At least they
 weren't pornography.

867
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,910
-Yes, at least.

868
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:33,390
-Still, if they were,
 and she was really happy,

869
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:36,510
I suppose I find some way
 of approving on that, too.

870
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:44,230
Oh, this damn thing.

871
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:46,500
-She's quite
 something, your mother.

872
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:50,240
The way she just parked on
 our lawn, like she was saying,

873
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,440
I have arrived, and I will
 park where I damn well please.

874
00:51:57,070 --> 00:51:58,700
-Please sit down, make
 yourself comfortable.

875
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:00,550
Just throw all that
 stuff on the floor.

876
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:02,320
It's what I do.

00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,780
-Is it all right to
 smoke in the house?

878
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,650
-Sure.

879

-Marian's very good at
 collecting interesting people.

880
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:13,960
You know what the trouble
 with interesting people is?

 like your brother,

-I'm nothing like, Tony.

Although, my mother, God bless,
 has spent most of her life

886
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:28,840
encouraging me to be.

887
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:32,160
-Your mother never struck me
 as being particularly happy

888
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,970
though.

889
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:36,150
-No.

890
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:38,480
She used to joke
 a lot, but I don't

891
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,630
remember her laughing much.

892
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:43,870
You know what she used
 to say all the time.

893
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:50,020
Life's too short not to
 do exactly what you want.

894
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:52,380
-Hmph, sounds like a threat.

895
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:55,010
-No, it was meant to be.

896
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:58,320
-Well, she sounds like
 my mother, selfish.

897
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,670
-Yeah, but somehow she
 managed to turn it into charm.

898
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:06,120
-Well, spoiled people
 are always charming.

899
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:09,010
It's part of what
 makes us attractive.

900
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:11,770
-Nina has a certain
 splendor about her,

901
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:16,590
which is far rarer and much more
 delightful than common sense.

902
00:53:16,590 --> 00:53:21,160
I swear she could charm
 an angel out of its wings.

903
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:23,810
-You make her
 sound a bit unreal.

904
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:25,860
-Well, sometimes
 she seems that way.

905
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:29,590
-Is Tony going to
 be there tonight?

906
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:32,670
You wouldn't believe the
 crush I used to have on him.

907
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:34,950
All he had to do was walk into
 a room and the walls danced,

908
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:37,740
and my legs buckled.

909
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:39,600
-Tony's dead.

910
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:40,100
-What?

911
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:44,360
-He died of AIDS last year.

912
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:53,840
-Aw, I'm so sorry.

913
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:54,840
-It's all right.

914
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,840
-I can't believe it.

915
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:02,290
We went to Morocco together.

916
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:08,500
I spent two weeks
 trying to seduce him.

917
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:15,510
Until I finally figured him out
 as far as anyone ever could.

918
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:18,770
-You've no idea how
 many beautiful women

919
00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:21,920
have told me that story.

920
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:22,880
-Thank you.

921
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:29,560
-I see so little of her
 nowadays that sometimes I

922
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:31,690
feel we're more like
 friends grown apart.

923
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:33,490
-Aren't you disappointed?

924
00:54:33,490 --> 00:54:34,340
-No.

925
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:35,320
Absolutely not.

926
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:38,700
I do not allow any room in
 my life for disappointments.

927
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:41,330
It's such a pernicious emotion.

928
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:45,680
There seems to me to be such
 a romantic notion of family

929
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,570
intimacy that I
 think is just that.

930
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:49,210
I think it's a notion.

931
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:51,470
Family should get
 together when they need to

932
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:55,340
and want to just
 like, like friends.

933
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:57,140
-But needing isn't
 always mutual.

934
00:54:57,140 --> 00:55:00,170
I mean, I know we're not obliged
 to love one another, but we do.

935
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:03,480
It would be unnatural not
 to want to be close to

936
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:04,570
and attend those we love.

937
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:05,520
Don't you think?

938
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,630
-That hasn't been my experience.

939
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:09,130
-Sorry.

940
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:13,800
It's just that it's been mine.

941
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:14,900
-Then you're lucky.

942
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:28,650
-Well, there's just another
 one of those damn notions.

943
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:31,740
I mean, ideally, we should
 all just love one another,

944
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:35,780
but family relationships
 do not always

945
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:37,900
live up to their expectations.

946
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:40,990
-So you're saying we
 should lower them?

947
00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:44,090
-If you ask me, we should
 get rid of them all together.

948
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:46,260
-So how old were you when
 your parents divorced.

949
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:50,360
-Uh, my mother divorced my
 father when I was a baby

950
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,140
and moved to Italy.

951
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53,480
I stayed in England
 with my father.

952
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:56,860
Tony went to live
 with my mother.

953
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:58,520
I used to see them every summer.

954
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:01,350
-So how did you end up here?

955
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:04,380
-My father sent me to
 camp here one summer.

956
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:06,390
I loved it.

957
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:08,170
Pretty much didn't go back.

958
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:09,880
You preferred camp to Europe?

959
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,400
-What can I say?

960
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,280
I'm not sophisticated.

961
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:13,560
Told you I was dull.

962
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,130
-All right.

963
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:15,990
OK.

964
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:19,800
-I used to imagine Tony and my
 mother on the beach in Italy,

965
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:23,930
you know, soaking up the sun
 and checking out the boys.

966
00:56:23,930 --> 00:56:26,650
And I'd think, well,
 I'm not like that.

967
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:28,610
Then I'd see my
 father sitting down

968
00:56:28,610 --> 00:56:32,110
to one of his fancy
 dinners in his London club,

969
00:56:32,110 --> 00:56:34,810
and I knew I wasn't
 like that either.

970
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:36,570
-So what are you like?

971
00:56:36,570 --> 00:56:44,330
-Well, these days just a kid
 happy to be in the woods.

972
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:47,340
-Oh, there's nothing so
 wonderful as being in love,

973
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:48,270
is there?

974
00:56:48,270 --> 00:56:53,270
I've been in love,
 have loved, 11 times

975
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:55,860
and have married four times.

976
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:58,220
-Are you in love now?

977
00:56:58,220 --> 00:56:58,720
-Yes.

978
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,710
Not with a man.

979
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:03,510
And not with a woman
 either for that matter.

980
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:05,770
I'm in love with
 my villa in Italy.

981
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:08,450
And it's one of the best
 love affairs I've ever had.

982
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:10,810
-I'd rather love people.

983
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:14,350
-Well, that's
 because you're young.

984
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:17,590
Young people are always in love
 with each other, and the world,

985
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:19,690
and themselves.

986
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:22,780
But when you get
 older, you'll find

987
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:28,520
a special joy of loving a home.

988
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:31,550
I mean, a home is-- it's yours.

989
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:33,320
A home belongs to you.

990
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:35,180
You belong to it.

991
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:41,540
And it never leaves you,
 which is comforting.

992
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:42,860
-Tony came to visit me once.

993
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:44,150
-At camp?

994
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:44,900
-Um-hmm.

995
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:46,890
It was an absolute disaster.

996
00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:48,960
-Oh, why is that?

997
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,650
He seduced one of
 the camp counselors.

998
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:53,940
Oh, it's funny now.

999
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:56,380
It was humiliating at the time.

1000
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:57,630
I was furious.

1001
00:57:57,630 --> 00:57:59,540
I didn't speak to him
 for years after that.

1002
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:01,350
-Well, did you ever make up?

1003
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:02,120
-Yeah.

1004
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:06,290
You know, we wouldn't have
 picked one another as brothers

1005
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:08,060
if we'd had the choice.

1006
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:11,570
But I think afterward,
 we forgave one another

1007
00:58:11,570 --> 00:58:12,860
for being different.

1008
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:19,060
We were both surprised by
 how much we liked each other.

1009
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:26,310
-Well, I never have
 been particularly lucky

1010
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:28,500
in my choice of men.

1011
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:32,090
They're either gay, or married.

1012
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:43,820
-I'm telling you, when
 I'm in my villa, all

1013
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:49,530
by myself alone at night,
 I feel wrapped in its arms.

1014
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:51,660
-Well, then to have a house
 full of people that you love

1015
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:52,870
would be ideal.

1016
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:54,540
-But then the house
 wouldn't be yours.

1017
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:56,480
-But wouldn't sharing
 make it better?

1018
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:01,760
-Well, would sharing
 Robert make him any better?

1019
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:02,330
No.

1020
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:05,580
I think we give away too
 much, and then we regret it.

1021
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:08,260
-Oh, but you can't give away
 too much to those you love.

1022
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:10,070
-Oh, well, you
 can only say that,

1023
00:59:10,070 --> 00:59:13,720
because you are such a
 kind and really good woman.

1024
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:16,820
I'm not that any longer.

1025
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:20,500
Kindness is a quality that
 gets worn out with the years.

1026
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,310
It leaves you with
 a little patent,

1027
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:24,130
but it's not the real thing.

1028
00:59:24,130 --> 00:59:28,310
That's why I like
 people like Robert here.

1029
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:30,850
Someone who desperately
 wants to love

1030
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:33,050
people instead of buildings.

1031
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:34,490
-Really?

1032
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:37,240
Most people think I'm cynical.

1033
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,030
No, judgmental.

1034
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:41,270
-Well, how can you
 live today and not

1035
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:43,320
be cynical unless
 you're an idiot.

1036
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:48,770
It's just an armor anyway,
 just covering our true selves.

1037
00:59:48,770 --> 00:59:51,510
And I don't think it's
 very thick on you yet.

1038
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:02,710
-You look like a man about
 to face a firing squad.

1039
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,330
-You're right, you're right.

1040
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:09,790
I've always been lucky.

1041
01:00:09,790 --> 01:00:11,950
-Oh, luck has very
 little to do with it.

1042
01:00:11,950 --> 01:00:12,940
Marrying well does.

1043
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:13,440
-Hello.

1044
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,170
-Please, don't get up.

1045
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:17,200
-We, um, we started without you.

1046
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,770
-Well, I've already eaten.

1047
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:21,250
I'm just here for the
 company and the alcohol.

1048
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:22,800
I'll start with a beer.

1049
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:23,880
-So where's Thierry?

1050
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:25,270
-He had to go back to the city.

1051
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:26,750
You must be Marian.

1052
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:27,250
I'm Nina.

1053
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:27,750
-Hello.

1054
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:29,170
-I've heard all about you.

1055
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:32,710
-This is Lyle and
 Robert, his friend.

1056
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:34,490
-His lover.

1057
01:00:34,490 --> 01:00:36,140
-What did I tell you?

1058
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:40,790
-What did she tell you?

1059
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:42,600
That all of the men
 that I find attractive

1060
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:47,350
are either gay, like these two,
 or Tony, or married like John.

1061
01:00:47,350 --> 01:00:49,770
-Your mother said
 you were engaged.

1062
01:00:49,770 --> 01:00:52,760
-Did she?

1063
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:56,950
Well, Thierry was, was being the
 operative word, my boyfriend.

1064
01:00:56,950 --> 01:00:59,120
And we were saying a
 less than tearful goodbye

1065
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,900
when your gallant
 husband arrived.

1066
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:02,010
-Oh.

1067
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:05,220
-Well, maybe my gallant husband
 could help me in the kitchen.

1068
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:16,120
Gallant, my ass.

1069
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:18,400
-You mentioned Tony.

1070
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,100
Tony Kerr.

1071
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:20,050
Did you know him?

1072
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:21,550
-Yeah, I used to very well.

1073
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:23,760
We went to Morocco together.

1074
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:27,330
-You went to Morocco
 with Tony Kerr?

1075
01:01:27,330 --> 01:01:27,990
-Yeah.

1076
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:31,930
When I was 18, right
 after boarding school.

1077
01:01:31,930 --> 01:01:34,490
-Wait, I was there, too.

1078
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:35,200
-With Tony?

1079
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,080
-Did you stay at the--

1080
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:38,200
-Aahana Hotel.

1081
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,120
-Yeah.

1082
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:40,960
-Hotel.

1083
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:45,650
Oh, we used to sit naked
 and read Joe Orton together.

1084
01:01:45,650 --> 01:01:47,360
-Yeah.

1085
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:50,540
-I had no idea he had died.

1086
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,180
-Well, I hadn't either.

1087
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:55,500
-He died here in this house.

1088
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:59,140
-Oh, well, this is
 no topic for dinner.

1089
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:00,750
-No, it's fine, really.

1090
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:05,340
-Well, I meant-- never mind.

1091
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:07,420
-She look's like she just
 got out of the Navy the way

1092
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:08,540
she's looking at you.

1093
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:15,630
-Well, everything looks
 just delicious Marian.

1094
01:02:19,590 --> 01:02:23,390
-Lyle, I was reading a review
 of your book in the "Times".

1095
01:02:23,390 --> 01:02:25,140
I found it very interesting.

1096
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:27,660
I tried to get a copy, but
 the book stores up here

1097
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:28,900
are just hopeless.

1098
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:30,630
-Well, I'm sure I've got
 an extra copy somewhere,

1099
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:33,630
and I could sign it for you
 before you go if you'd like.

1100
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:34,730
-Really, that
 would be very nice.

1101
01:02:34,730 --> 01:02:35,770
Thank you.
 -What's it called?

1102
01:02:35,770 --> 01:02:37,180
Neo This, Neo That.

1103
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:40,030
-Oh, that's the
 story of my life.

1104
01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:41,550
Here, to a happy weekend.

1105
01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:47,860
-My mother's writing a book.

1106
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:48,630
-Really?

1107
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:49,430
What about?

1108
01:02:49,430 --> 01:02:50,450
My late husband.

1109
01:02:50,450 --> 01:02:53,350
Nina's stepfather,
 Atorian Ponti.

1110
01:02:53,350 --> 01:02:54,420
-The architect?

1111
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:54,920
-Yes.

1112
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:55,870
You've heard of him?

1113
01:02:55,870 --> 01:02:57,300
-Of course.

1114
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:59,030
He's one of the greatest
 European architects

1115
01:02:59,030 --> 01:02:59,560
of this century.

1116
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:02,210
-It's a pity his work never
 caught on in the United States.

1117
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:04,100
-I guess he was just
 too much of a maverick.

1118
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:05,370
-Yes, he was a maverick.

1119
01:03:05,370 --> 01:03:06,840
-I think he was a genius.

1120
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:07,920
-So do I.

1121
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:10,600
-I would love to read your
 book when it's finished.

1122
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:14,010
-Well, I'm afraid it's not
 going forward very quickly.

1123
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:16,850
I guess I've just bitten
 off more than I can chew.

1124
01:03:16,850 --> 01:03:19,980
Atorian is so rich
 and contrast, it's

1125
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:21,990
really hard to
 capture him in words.

1126
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:22,970
-Excuse me.

1127
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,800
-Where are you going?

1128
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:32,360
-I left my wallet
 down by the wall.

1129
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:35,240
-Well, it's not going anywhere.

1130
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:36,710
-Be right back.

1131
01:03:50,050 --> 01:03:51,280
-I don't know, pretty
 soon he's going

1132
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:53,800
to start sleeping
 by that damn wall.

1133
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,320
-Well, let him.

1134
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:56,920
One thing I've
 learned in my life

1135
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:59,130
is to let men sleep
 where they want to.

1136
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,770
So Robert, you
 don't know anything

1137
01:04:06,770 --> 01:04:10,450
about restoration
 of canvases and--

1138
01:04:10,450 --> 01:04:14,400
-Marian did that for
 several years at the Met.

1139
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:14,900
-Really?

1140
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:15,750
Well, I didn't know that.

1141
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:18,160
That's very interesting.

1142
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:21,400
Have you restored old
 canvases and things?

1143
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:21,900
-Um-hmm.

1144
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:25,440
-How about frescoes, which is
 what I'm really getting at?

1145
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:25,970
-Only canvasses.

1146
01:04:25,970 --> 01:04:27,480
Why do you ask?

1147
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:31,170
-I'm doing some work
 on my house in Italy.

1148
01:04:31,170 --> 01:04:33,200
And we ran across some frescoes.

1149
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:36,020
They're very badly
 damaged, but I

1150
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:37,610
would love to have
 them restored.

1151
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:38,880
-That must feel like a miracle.

1152
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,270
-It does.

1153
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:43,830
-Just digging in the
 ground and there they are.

1154
01:04:43,830 --> 01:04:44,330
-Yes.

1155
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:46,020
-Are they beautiful?

1156
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:47,550
-Oh, I think so.

1157
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,490
I mean, I don't know whether
 Atorian would have thought

1158
01:04:49,490 --> 01:04:53,720
really, but I think
 they're very beautiful.

1159
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:56,040
Well, I could certainly get some
 names of someone if you want.

1160
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:58,450
I mean, you hate to
 go to all that trouble

1161
01:04:58,450 --> 01:05:01,430
and have them turn
 out second rate.

1162
01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:08,710
-I wouldn't want you
 to go to any trouble.

1163
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:12,400
-Oh, it wouldn't be a trouble.

1164
01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:25,710
-Lyle, could you go
 see where John is.

1165
01:05:25,710 --> 01:05:27,090
His food's getting cold.

1166
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:28,150
-I'll go.

1167
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:28,650
-Nina.

1168
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:32,920
-It makes much
 more sense if I go.

1169
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:37,160
I've already eaten, so
 which way is this, uh, wall.

1170
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:38,490
-You might get lost down there.

1171
01:05:38,490 --> 01:05:40,560
I think he's created
 a bit of a maze.

1172
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:45,360
Well, I have an unerring
 sense of direction as long

1173
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:47,720
as I know where I'm going.

1174
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:49,400
-It's just across the lawn.

1175
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:51,620
There's a little pathway
 above the trees to the right.

1176
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:19,960
-Did you know the word, crochet
 comes from the old French word

1177
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:24,540
croak, meaning, say
 your prayers, rabbit.

1178
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:26,360
-Oh, no, no.

1179
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:29,550
It comes from the old
 Gaelic word [GAELIC],

1180
01:06:29,550 --> 01:06:31,720
which means leave my
 ball alone you lying,

1181
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:34,360
cheating, sick bastard.

1182
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:40,530
-Can we play doubles?

1183
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:44,600
No, no, because
 then Lyle and Marian

1184
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,620
will be discussing
 postmodernism,

1185
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:49,700
and I can only take so much
 deconstruction in one weekend.

1186
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:54,400
Hmm.

1187
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,540
Sometimes I wish I'd
 been born lucky instead

1188
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:59,540
of handsome and talented.

1189
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:02,310
-It's funny.

1190
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:05,140
I always thought you
 were the lucky one.

1191
01:07:05,140 --> 01:07:06,890
-Compared to you?

1192
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:07,680
It's all relative.

1193
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:20,230
-You know, you can stay
 here as long as you like.

1194
01:07:20,230 --> 01:07:22,810
-Maybe it's like a vacation.

1195
01:07:22,810 --> 01:07:25,340
-What is?

1196
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:27,860
You know how when
 you're on holiday,

1197
01:07:27,860 --> 01:07:30,030
you pretend you're
 having such a great time,

1198
01:07:30,030 --> 01:07:35,500
but then towards the end, you
 just, you want to get home,

1199
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:39,070
sleep in your own bed
 with your pillows.

1200
01:07:39,070 --> 01:07:40,270
Maybe life's like that.

1201
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:46,500
Whoa, what hit me?

1202
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:47,230
-Last martini, mate.

1203
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:53,050
-All right.

1204
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:01,300
Hey.

1205
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:03,520
I'm poison.

1206
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:04,220
I'm poison.

1207
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:17,210
-Sorry, the door was open.

1208
01:08:22,030 --> 01:08:26,210
-So whole circus coming,
 or is it just us?

1209
01:08:26,210 --> 01:08:27,700
-It's just us.

1210
01:08:31,170 --> 01:08:34,140
Did you make this?

1211
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:34,640
-Yeah.

1212
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:39,150
-It's amazing.

1213
01:08:39,150 --> 01:08:39,650
-Thanks.

1214
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:47,900
I was just thinking what
 I was going to build next.

1215
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:50,520
Something big right
 out in the middle

1216
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:52,490
of the lake with
 about two feet of it

1217
01:08:52,490 --> 01:08:55,350
sticking above the surface.

1218
01:08:55,350 --> 01:08:58,110
-Something you can
 only see from below.

1219
01:08:58,110 --> 01:08:58,610
-Yeah.

1220
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:03,010
-I like that.

1221
01:09:08,730 --> 01:09:12,800
We should go back.

1222
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:15,370
-You just got here.

1223
01:09:15,370 --> 01:09:16,360
Sit down.

1224
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:36,980
-Two people sitting side by
 side on a rocking good night.

1225
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:42,280
We're as good as guilty already.

1226
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:15,050
You're not dull.

1227
01:10:36,610 --> 01:10:39,050
-Hmm.

1228
01:10:39,050 --> 01:10:40,220
-Violence gathers
 in a small place.

1229
01:10:43,190 --> 01:10:46,660
A room, a bed, a glove.

1230
01:10:46,660 --> 01:10:49,120
-What's that?

1231
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,920
-That's the infant Jesus
 of Prague, James Schuyler.

1232
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:56,150
-I don't think I like it.

1233
01:10:56,150 --> 01:10:58,210
-It's the most wonderful thing.

1234
01:10:58,210 --> 01:10:59,310
-It sounds like a threat.

1235
01:11:02,790 --> 01:11:03,930
-More like a warning.

1236
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:17,990
-What am I going to do with you?

1237
01:11:17,990 --> 01:11:20,140
-Hey, what am I going
 to do without you?

1238
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:23,120
-Get on with your life.

1239
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,200
You don't need to
 know what you want.

1240
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:27,110
You just need to know
 what you don't want.

1241
01:11:27,110 --> 01:11:29,270
-I don't want you to keep
 trying to cheer me up.

1242
01:11:29,270 --> 01:11:29,770
-Hey.

1243
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:49,010
Times like this you
 have to figure out

1244
01:11:49,010 --> 01:11:53,150
what it is about life
 that still delights you.

1245
01:11:53,150 --> 01:11:56,070
Then grab a hold of it.

1246
01:11:56,070 --> 01:11:58,720
Grow claws if you have
 to, but just don't let go.

1247
01:12:07,870 --> 01:12:09,320
You delight me.

1248
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:28,250
-All the anodized aluminum,
 but that is if they let me.

1249
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:31,570
The Italian government is
 just impossible sometimes.

1250
01:12:31,570 --> 01:12:33,390
You can't even
 clean out a closet

1251
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:36,120
without their permission.

1252
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:38,020
-Yeah, but you really
 got to hand to them.

1253
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:40,330
They've kept their
 country really beautiful.

1254
01:12:40,330 --> 01:12:42,810
-Yeah, they have, haven't they?

1255
01:12:42,810 --> 01:12:45,820
Well, I'm going to
 ask you something,

1256
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:48,080
and just answer me honestly.

1257
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:51,330
Are you a good painter?

1258
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:53,240
-I think I am.

1259
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:54,200
Yes.

1260
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:56,770
I admit I am.

1261
01:12:56,770 --> 01:12:59,080
All right, then, I want
 to make you an offer.

1262
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:02,180
You know those I have
 that need restoring?

1263
01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:05,330
Why don't you come and do them?

1264
01:13:05,330 --> 01:13:07,480
-Oh, I, I don't really
 know a lot about frescoes.

1265
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:08,750
Oh, you can learn.

1266
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:09,990
I'm sure you can.

1267
01:13:09,990 --> 01:13:12,820
I mean, I'd pay you,
 of course, and there's

1268
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:15,200
a very nice little apartment
 right on the grounds.

1269
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:17,580
-I don't know what to say.

1270
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:20,040
-Well, think about it.

1271
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:21,480
-Love at first sight.

1272
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:24,150
-My mother's always been
 a sucker for artists.

1273
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:26,860
-Ah, put it on your head.

1274
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:27,690
You'd be Carmen Miranda.

1275
01:13:27,690 --> 01:13:29,150
-Too beautiful to eat.

1276
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:34,700
-Oh, Robert.

1277
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:35,800
Here.

1278
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:36,950
They're grape scissors.

1279
01:13:36,950 --> 01:13:39,570
We use them to cut a bunch.

1280
01:13:39,570 --> 01:13:42,950
Take a branch and cut
 the stem like this.

1281
01:13:42,950 --> 01:13:45,370
Not difficult.

1282
01:13:45,370 --> 01:13:47,300
-Go ahead, Robert.

1283
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:49,690
-Oh, for heaven's
 sakes, don't tame him.

1284
01:13:49,690 --> 01:13:53,780
Let him eat grapes with
 his fingers if he wants to.

1285
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:56,500
Let's all rid ourselves of
 these ridiculous, ridiculous,

1286
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:58,980
ridiculous affectations.

1287
01:14:04,930 --> 01:14:06,910
-They were my grandmothers.

1288
01:14:16,830 --> 01:14:19,310
-I didn't mean any harm.

1289
01:14:19,310 --> 01:14:22,150
-That's when you usually
 do the most damage.

1290
01:14:22,150 --> 01:14:23,070
-I'll go talk to her.

1291
01:14:23,070 --> 01:14:23,570
-No, no.

1292
01:14:23,570 --> 01:14:26,850
I, I've broken something here.

1293
01:14:26,850 --> 01:14:29,570
It's up to me to put it right.

1294
01:14:29,570 --> 01:14:30,530
Oh, dear.

1295
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:38,150
-I'm going for a walk.

1296
01:14:38,150 --> 01:14:39,310
-I'll come with you.

1297
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:48,050
Marian, I am so sorry.

1298
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:48,710
-I'm sorry.

1299
01:14:48,710 --> 01:14:51,750
-Oh, no, you have nothing
 to be sorry about.

1300
01:14:51,750 --> 01:14:55,060
I just, I know you want this
 to be a special evening,

1301
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:56,710
and I've gong and spoiled it.

1302
01:14:56,710 --> 01:14:57,210
-Laura--

1303
01:14:57,210 --> 01:14:57,810
-I'm really sorry.

1304
01:14:57,810 --> 01:14:58,680
-You didn't spoil it.

1305
01:14:58,680 --> 01:14:59,780
I spoiled it.

1306
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:01,810
Gloriously.

1307
01:15:01,810 --> 01:15:03,260
Where's Jonathan?

1308
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:06,620
-He's outside with Nina.

1309
01:15:06,620 --> 01:15:08,560
And Lyle, and Robert.

1310
01:15:11,950 --> 01:15:12,450
-OK.

1311
01:15:12,450 --> 01:15:15,700
-One night's good food
 and wine, tears, laughter.

1312
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:18,130
Summer casts a spell
 on all of us, Marian.

1313
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,340
Oh, come on.

1314
01:15:32,310 --> 01:15:36,870
-One of my mother's
 more restrained moments.

1315
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:39,950
Well, I guess Tony was
 here tonight after all.

1316
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:51,230
Why, if you, if you were dead
 would you ever choose to hold.

1317
01:15:55,950 --> 01:15:58,210
-I didn't know you smoked.

1318
01:15:58,210 --> 01:16:00,900
-I used to smoke, all the time.

1319
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:03,030
-In the good old days?

1320
01:16:03,030 --> 01:16:05,500
Before dinner, I overheard John
 and Marian talking about us.

1321
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:06,670
They don't think
 I'm right for you.

1322
01:16:06,670 --> 01:16:08,910
They think it won't last.

1323
01:16:08,910 --> 01:16:11,120
-People conjecture about
 relationships all the time.

1324
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:12,670
It doesn't necessarily
 mean they're right.

1325
01:16:12,670 --> 01:16:14,130
-So you think they're wrong?

1326
01:16:14,130 --> 01:16:15,220
You think I'm right for you?

1327
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:17,050
-Look, you're still not upset
 about the grape scissors,

1328
01:16:17,050 --> 01:16:17,860
are you?

1329
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:20,480
-All I'm asking
 is can you imagine

1330
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,230
our relationship developing?

1331
01:16:22,230 --> 01:16:25,450
Can you imagine us loving
 one another, because I can.

1332
01:16:25,450 --> 01:16:27,300
-Robert, I'm fond of you.

1333
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:29,480
This isn't about love.

1334
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:32,480
-Well, if you don't love, why
 did you tell me that you did?

1335
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:34,420
-Robert, there are times one
 could be forgiven for not

1336
01:16:34,420 --> 01:16:36,690
speaking the literal
 truth when one's--

1337
01:16:36,690 --> 01:16:38,040
-Fuck this one stuff.

1338
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:39,980
And if you think that
 I'm going back there,

1339
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:42,030
you're fucking crazy.

1340
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:43,280
-You know, one of
 these days, life

1341
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:44,760
is going to present
 both of us a bill.

1342
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:49,070
I'm not sure either one of us
 are going to be able to pay up.

1343
01:16:49,070 --> 01:16:51,030
-Oh, please.

1344
01:16:51,030 --> 01:16:52,350
There is a lot more
 bothering Marian

1345
01:16:52,350 --> 01:16:53,480
than me flirting
 with her husband.

1346
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:56,210
And I don't think throwing
 the grape scissors did

1347
01:16:56,210 --> 01:16:58,940
too much for her equilibrium.

1348
01:16:58,940 --> 01:17:01,990
-No, but I did apologize.

1349
01:17:01,990 --> 01:17:03,970
-Well, maybe you shouldn't have.

1350
01:17:03,970 --> 01:17:06,430
If I was Robert, I
 would have hit her.

1351
01:17:06,430 --> 01:17:09,880
-You know, people only humiliate
 each other when they're afraid.

1352
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:12,840
-And what are we afraid of?

1353
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:14,320
-Us?

1354
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:17,280
-Yeah.

1355
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:19,740
-Each other.

1356
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:20,980
-Oh, Jesus, watch out!

1357
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:32,570
-Lyle, what are you doing?

1358
01:17:32,570 --> 01:17:35,020
Where's Robert?

1359
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:38,150
-He went back to the house.

1360
01:17:38,150 --> 01:17:38,860
-I couldn't hear.

1361
01:17:44,890 --> 01:17:52,580
-Look, uh, sorry about the
 thing with the grape scissors.

1362
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:55,440
-I thought it was pretty rude.

1363
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:59,530
-No, Marian wasn't,
 didn't mean to be rude.

1364
01:17:59,530 --> 01:18:01,370
Robert just didn't understand.

1365
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:04,100
-She'll apologize in
 the morning, I'm sure.

1366
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:05,340
Your face is cut.

1367
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:06,140
You have blood all over.

1368
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:06,640
What--

1369
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:09,550
-No, I'm all right.

1370
01:18:09,550 --> 01:18:13,030
-What happened?

1371
01:18:13,030 --> 01:18:15,900
-I fell down and I
 broke my glasses.

1372
01:18:18,550 --> 01:18:22,950
I can't really see without them.

1373
01:18:22,950 --> 01:18:26,020
Robert's not really
 at the house.

1374
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:27,790
-What?

1375
01:18:27,790 --> 01:18:30,890
-We had a fight, and he
 ran off into the woods

1376
01:18:30,890 --> 01:18:34,510
to look for the train station.

1377
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:36,550
-He didn't do this?

1378
01:18:36,550 --> 01:18:38,370
-No.

1379
01:18:38,370 --> 01:18:41,160
-Look, I'd better get
 you back in the house.

1380
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:42,450
I'll go look for Robert.

1381
01:18:42,450 --> 01:18:43,830
If he wants to
 leave, I'll take him

1382
01:18:43,830 --> 01:18:44,830
to the station in the morning.

1383
01:18:44,830 --> 01:18:45,800
Come on.

1384
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:48,210
-What the fuck was I doing?

1385
01:18:48,210 --> 01:18:51,430
I mean, what business did
 I have bringing him here?

1386
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:54,520
-Business.

1387
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:58,200
-Then, why do we invest in them?

1388
01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:59,470
Why do we spend our
 whole lives trying

1389
01:18:59,470 --> 01:19:01,000
to get something out of them?

1390
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:06,590
-Some of it's done.

1391
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:11,890
-I was betraying him.

1392
01:19:15,230 --> 01:19:16,210
Your brother.

1393
01:19:29,470 --> 01:19:30,940
-I don't know.

1394
01:19:30,940 --> 01:19:34,870
This doesn't look
 very promising.

1395
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:36,500
Listen, why don't
 you change your mind

1396
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:39,010
and come on over to my
 house and spend the night.

1397
01:19:39,010 --> 01:19:40,840
-She makes a terrific breakfast.

1398
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:43,690
-Yes, I really do, and it's
 freezing to death out here.

1399
01:19:43,690 --> 01:19:45,590
Come on.

1400
01:19:45,590 --> 01:19:52,210
-Thanks, but I think I prefer
 to stay here at the station.

1401
01:19:52,210 --> 01:19:54,280
-Oh, maybe you shouldn't
 have pressed Lyle.

1402
01:19:57,970 --> 01:20:00,980
-You know, I thought
 he'd answer differently.

1403
01:20:00,980 --> 01:20:01,890
-Yeah.

1404
01:20:01,890 --> 01:20:04,350
-At least, I hoped he might.

1405
01:20:04,350 --> 01:20:08,290
-Hope can be very intimidating
 to a lot of people.

1406
01:20:08,290 --> 01:20:09,890
Especially to people
 like Lyle and me,

1407
01:20:09,890 --> 01:20:12,800
who don't have a whole lot left.

1408
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,120
-Hey, I didn't
 know what you were

1409
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:15,970
doing with him in
 the first place.

1410
01:20:15,970 --> 01:20:18,490
-You know, I think
 that mourning should

1411
01:20:18,490 --> 01:20:21,100
be taken as an aphrodisiac.

1412
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:23,600
No, I simply mean
 that I don't think

1413
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:27,770
it should be an excuse for
 you not to fall in love again.

1414
01:20:27,770 --> 01:20:36,300
Still, it can be very difficult
 when it fizzles again,

1415
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:39,130
especially when you're young
 and have no perspective.

1416
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,430
-I have my own perspective.

1417
01:20:45,430 --> 01:20:47,290
-Oh, of course, you do.

1418
01:20:47,290 --> 01:20:48,860
That was so smug of me.

1419
01:20:48,860 --> 01:20:49,870
No, no.

1420
01:20:49,870 --> 01:20:52,750
I just sometimes, I
 think, because I've

1421
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:54,910
been asked questions,
 I know all the answers.

1422
01:20:54,910 --> 01:20:56,190
I'm really sorry.

1423
01:20:56,190 --> 01:20:58,310
-No, I think you're wonderful.

1424
01:20:58,310 --> 01:20:59,270
You're smart.

1425
01:20:59,270 --> 01:21:00,690
You're funny.

1426
01:21:00,690 --> 01:21:02,590
And nice.

1427
01:21:02,590 --> 01:21:04,020
-Thank you.

1428
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:06,390
-Your welcome.

1429
01:21:06,390 --> 01:21:09,700
-Listen, let me
 give you my card.

1430
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:12,540
I'll be in Italy in September.

1431
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:15,520
Now, whatever you
 decide, you know?

1432
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,920
Keep in touch.

1433
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:21,670
I mean, if it's only to let
 me know that the train came.

1434
01:21:21,670 --> 01:21:22,660
I will.

1435
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:37,280
-Ciao.

1436
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:37,780
-Ciao.

1437
01:21:56,270 --> 01:21:58,430
-You really should go, you know?

1438
01:21:58,430 --> 01:22:01,690
It's Italy.

1439
01:22:01,690 --> 01:22:03,530
My mother's got a lot
 of maternal instincts

1440
01:22:03,530 --> 01:22:06,810
she needs to express.

1441
01:22:06,810 --> 01:22:09,870
It might as well be to you.

1442
01:22:09,870 --> 01:22:13,290
-Why not you?

1443
01:22:13,290 --> 01:22:20,620
-It takes time and
 effort, selflessness.

1444
01:22:25,050 --> 01:22:26,330
Something we both
 lack in spades.

1445
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:32,260
Promise me you'll go.

1446
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:40,160
-OK.

1447
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:42,630
-Thank you.

1448
01:22:42,630 --> 01:22:44,110
Good night, Robert.

1449
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:52,010
[KNOCKING]

1450
01:22:52,010 --> 01:22:52,510
-Lyle.

1451
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:58,720
[KNOCKING]

1452
01:22:58,720 --> 01:22:59,520
-Lyle?

1453
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:00,020
-Yes.

1454
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:04,120
-Is everything all right?

1455
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:06,210
I saw John drive away.

1456
01:23:06,210 --> 01:23:09,620
-Laura Ponti left
 her house keys here.

1457
01:23:09,620 --> 01:23:12,570
-Oh.

1458
01:23:12,570 --> 01:23:15,030
I didn't hear the phone.

1459
01:23:15,030 --> 01:23:17,520
-Maybe John found them,
 and then called her.

1460
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:22,120
I'm not sure which, but
 he said to be right back.

1461
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:23,320
-He's probably on
 one of his drives.

1462
01:23:27,450 --> 01:23:31,020
Did you and Robert
 have a nice walk?

1463
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:33,940
-Yes.

1464
01:23:33,940 --> 01:23:35,110
Good night, Marian.

1465
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:38,100
-Night.

1466
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:41,860
Night Robert, and sorry
 about the grape scissors.

1467
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:54,110
-Marian, this is Laura.

1468
01:23:54,110 --> 01:23:57,750
I'm sorry to be calling
 so late, but I just

1469
01:23:57,750 --> 01:23:59,980
thought you would like to
 know that I dropped Robert off

1470
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:01,190
at the station.

1471
01:24:01,190 --> 01:24:03,580
-I thought Robert was here.

1472
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:05,320
Why would you drop
 him at the station?

1473
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:08,870
-Well, that's where
 he wanted to go.

1474
01:24:08,870 --> 01:24:11,390
Would you tell Lyle that I
 called, because Robert really

1475
01:24:11,390 --> 01:24:13,900
wanted him to know
 that he was all right.

1476
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:16,420
And Marian, thank you
 again for a lovely dinner.

1477
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:17,200
Good night.

1478
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:18,180
-Good night.

1479
01:24:33,830 --> 01:24:35,300
-What's going on?

1480
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:36,490
Laura Ponti just
 called, and said

1481
01:24:36,490 --> 01:24:38,200
that she dropped
 Robert at the station.

1482
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:40,990
-Oh, she found him.

1483
01:24:40,990 --> 01:24:42,820
Good.

1484
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:43,320
-Good.

1485
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:43,820
What's good?

1486
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:45,200
What's going on, John?

1487
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:47,330
-Robert and Lyle had a fight.

1488
01:24:51,070 --> 01:24:51,600
Robert ran off.

1489
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:52,820
Lyle walked into a tree.

1490
01:24:58,450 --> 01:25:01,830
-But he's OK.

1491
01:25:01,830 --> 01:25:04,730
-He cut his face.

1492
01:25:04,730 --> 01:25:05,610
And he's upset.

1493
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:12,470
-So where have you been?

1494
01:25:12,470 --> 01:25:14,360
-I went to look for Robert.

1495
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:15,210
-Hmm.

1496
01:25:15,210 --> 01:25:19,480
Well, Lyle said that you'd
 gone to drop off Laura's keys

1497
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:20,590
that she had left from here.

1498
01:25:20,590 --> 01:25:21,360
Why would he lie to me?

1499
01:25:24,010 --> 01:25:24,880
-Maybe he was embarrassed.

1500
01:25:35,190 --> 01:25:38,250
-Well, so we were right
 about the two of them.

1501
01:25:48,150 --> 01:25:50,120
-God, Marian.

1502
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:51,490
You sound so mean.

1503
01:27:14,830 --> 01:27:16,810
-Oh, shit.

1504
01:27:44,150 --> 01:27:46,140
-Morning.

1505
01:27:46,140 --> 01:27:47,190
-Ouch!

1506
01:27:47,190 --> 01:27:49,660
That's got to hurt.

1507
01:27:49,660 --> 01:27:50,990
-Actually, It's not so bad.

1508
01:27:50,990 --> 01:27:53,820
I'm feeling quite butch.

1509
01:27:56,690 --> 01:27:59,480
Well, I do have no idea why
 they call them black eyes.

1510
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:01,700
-You mean the color blue.

1511
01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:04,560
Did I wake you?

1512
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:08,400
-No, I couldn't sleep.

1513
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:09,800
Checking for the damage.

1514
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:15,040
-Just because you can't see
 doesn't me it's not there.

1515
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:18,420
-What's this?

1516
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:21,810
It's Robert's chair.

1517
01:28:21,810 --> 01:28:22,480
-It's lovely.

1518
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:26,240
-May I ask you something?

1519
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:27,700
-Of course.

1520
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:30,000
-Did you like Robert?

1521
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,490
-Nope.

1522
01:28:32,490 --> 01:28:35,930
I didn't get a chance to
 know him before he ran off.

1523
01:28:35,930 --> 01:28:39,140
-He kind of got the feeling
 you didn't like him.

1524
01:28:39,140 --> 01:28:41,900
-That's a shame.

1525
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:43,490
-Actually, he
 overheard you telling

1526
01:28:43,490 --> 01:28:45,020
John you didn't like him.

1527
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:45,910
-Why did you do that to me?

1528
01:28:45,910 --> 01:28:46,170
-What?

1529
01:28:46,170 --> 01:28:47,640
-Ask me a question when
 you knew the answer?

1530
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:48,990
-I wanted to see
 what you'd tell me.

1531
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:50,850
-Well, you didn't think
 I'd tell you the truth?

1532
01:28:50,850 --> 01:28:53,110
-Marian, yesterday you
 told me you liked him.

1533
01:28:53,110 --> 01:28:54,510
-Well, maybe yesterday
 I liked him Lyle,

1534
01:28:54,510 --> 01:28:55,610
but I'm not going
 to sit and make

1535
01:28:55,610 --> 01:28:58,180
a judgment on whether I like
 a person or not based on what?

1536
01:28:58,180 --> 01:28:59,350
A couple of hours
 in their company?

1537
01:28:59,350 --> 01:29:01,510
-Oh really, see, that's exactly
 what he thought you did.

1538
01:29:01,510 --> 01:29:02,010
-What?

1539
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:03,910
He ran off because
 Marian didn't like him?

1540
01:29:03,910 --> 01:29:05,310
-Knew you didn't like him.

1541
01:29:05,310 --> 01:29:07,130
-Well, I'm sorry that he
 overheard a conversation that

1542
01:29:07,130 --> 01:29:07,630
he--

1543
01:29:07,630 --> 01:29:10,030
-Don't be sorry, Marian.

1544
01:29:10,030 --> 01:29:10,530
-Why?

1545
01:29:10,530 --> 01:29:11,270
It's my fault.

1546
01:29:11,270 --> 01:29:12,270
Isn't that what you're saying?

1547
01:29:12,270 --> 01:29:13,920
-Jesus Christ, your fault,
 you, all your fault.

1548
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:14,990
No, it's not your fault.

1549
01:29:19,110 --> 01:29:24,090
He didn't leave because he
 thought you didn't like him.

1550
01:29:24,090 --> 01:29:28,720
He left, because he
 thought I didn't like him.

1551
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:33,600
He wanted me to tell
 him that I loved him.

1552
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:34,340
I couldn't.

1553
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:40,170
So he panicked, and he ran away.

1554
01:29:40,170 --> 01:29:42,290
-Well, he's well.

1555
01:29:42,290 --> 01:29:45,160
-Some of us are just better
 at hiding it than others.

1556
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:46,890
-Lyle, you don't run off
 in the middle of the night

1557
01:29:46,890 --> 01:29:48,960
just because someone
 doesn't say I love you.

1558
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:49,460
-Really?

1559
01:29:49,460 --> 01:29:49,960
Brilliant.

1560
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:51,950
I didn't know that.

1561
01:29:51,950 --> 01:29:53,940
I liked him.

1562
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:56,430
I liked him a lot.

1563
01:30:10,110 --> 01:30:13,820
-Did Lyle say what the
 argument with Robert was about?

1564
01:30:13,820 --> 01:30:16,770
-Robert overheard me telling
 you I didn't like him.

1565
01:30:16,770 --> 01:30:17,270
-Oh.

1566
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:27,420
-Do you really think I'm mean?

1567
01:30:27,420 --> 01:30:29,400
-You're a fine person, Marian.

1568
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:39,060
What did Lyle really say to you?

1569
01:30:39,060 --> 01:30:41,660
-It's about me.

1570
01:30:41,660 --> 01:30:42,160
Hey.

1571
01:30:44,930 --> 01:30:45,430
Oh.

1572
01:30:45,430 --> 01:30:48,240
Did Mommy upset you, too?

1573
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:51,670
There Mommy.

1574
01:30:51,670 --> 01:30:52,580
There Mommy.

1575
01:31:19,900 --> 01:31:22,220
-Anything interesting
 in the "Times".

1576
01:31:22,220 --> 01:31:25,860
-One laugh after another.

1577
01:31:25,860 --> 01:31:28,340
-Why is it that you look
 the best in the peace

1578
01:31:28,340 --> 01:31:31,350
and quiet that follows
 a violent storm?

1579
01:31:31,350 --> 01:31:34,850
-Well, I am something
 of a season campaigner.

1580
01:31:34,850 --> 01:31:37,060
What's up?

1581
01:31:37,060 --> 01:31:38,140
-My schedule.

1582
01:31:38,140 --> 01:31:41,910
We're going to
 Toronto on Thursday.

1583
01:31:41,910 --> 01:31:44,620
-Oh, well, will you
 have any spare time?

1584
01:31:44,620 --> 01:31:47,640
I mean, you could stay
 up here a few days.

1585
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:49,680
Thierry, too, of
 course, if you'd like.

1586
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:53,580
-The only place I'll be
 seeing Thierry is at the set.

1587
01:31:53,580 --> 01:31:54,550
-Oh.

1588
01:31:54,550 --> 01:31:57,910
I'm sorry.

1589
01:31:57,910 --> 01:32:01,770
-No, you're not.

1590
01:32:01,770 --> 01:32:07,660
He was just another way of
 punishing you, and hurting

1591
01:32:07,660 --> 01:32:09,500
myself.

1592
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:11,830
And I think it's
 about time I stopped

1593
01:32:11,830 --> 01:32:15,620
doing both of those things.

1594
01:32:15,620 --> 01:32:16,770
-That would make me very happy.

1595
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:26,620
Listen, um, I didn't misbehave
 too badly last night, did I?

1596
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:29,020
-No, half the time
 you were charming.

1597
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:32,370
-And the other half?

1598
01:32:32,370 --> 01:32:34,320
-You thought you were charming.

1599
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:46,500
You loved Atorian
 very much, didn't you?

1600
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,560
-As much as you
 loved your father.

1601
01:32:56,420 --> 01:32:59,530
Well, they're still alive
 in our dreams, aren't they?

1602
01:33:02,980 --> 01:33:03,480
-Yeah.

1603
01:33:36,140 --> 01:33:37,840
-It's better going
 back to the city

1604
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:40,910
than leaving it don't you think?

1605
01:33:40,910 --> 01:33:43,860
Lyle?

1606
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:47,790
It's comforting traveling in
 the same direction as the river.

1607
01:33:47,790 --> 01:33:48,290
-Hmm.

1608
01:34:00,420 --> 01:34:02,810
-I do feel awful about
 what happened with Robert.

1609
01:34:05,580 --> 01:34:10,030
When the two of you came here
 to stay, you were both so happy.

1610
01:34:10,030 --> 01:34:13,000
I wasn't nice to him.

1611
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:13,500
-No.

1612
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:23,430
It wasn't about Robert.

1613
01:34:23,430 --> 01:34:24,600
It was about Tony.

1614
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:25,570
-I know.

1615
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:35,330
-Mourning should sooth the
 objects, not the subjects.

1616
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:40,970
-And I don't mourn Tony well.

1617
01:34:44,420 --> 01:34:55,290
-Neither do I. Will
 you invite Robert back?

1618
01:34:58,050 --> 01:34:59,350
Do you want me to call him?

1619
01:34:59,350 --> 01:35:00,530
-I will.

1620
01:35:00,530 --> 01:35:01,030
-OK.

1621
01:35:08,150 --> 01:35:09,880
-That's us.

1622
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:10,620
Well, me.

1623
01:35:17,630 --> 01:35:20,540
-Are we still friends?

1624
01:35:20,540 --> 01:35:22,380
-Of course, we are.

1625
01:35:31,290 --> 01:35:31,790
-OK.

1626
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:08,420
-Lyle.

1627
01:36:12,120 --> 01:36:16,980
In your life, love never
 gets expressed directly.

1628
01:36:16,980 --> 01:36:19,460
You get in touch
 with your emotions,

1629
01:36:19,460 --> 01:36:22,370
and then you run away from them.

1630
01:36:22,370 --> 01:36:25,150
-But you know I love you.

1631
01:36:25,150 --> 01:36:28,030
-It shouldn't require so
 much effort on my part.

1632
01:36:30,980 --> 01:36:36,170
Promise me things
 will be different.

1633
01:36:36,170 --> 01:36:39,150
After.

1634
01:36:39,150 --> 01:36:41,630
-I don't want there
 to be an after.

1635
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:47,580
-Promise.

1636
01:37:00,970 --> 01:37:05,430
-There are things you lose
 you don't ever get back.

1637
01:37:05,430 --> 01:37:08,280
You can never have them again
 except in the smudging carbon

1638
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:11,240
copy of memory.

1639
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:15,520
There are things that seem
 irreconcilable that you

1640
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:19,490
must find a way
 to reconcile with.

1641
01:37:19,490 --> 01:37:22,770
The simple passage of days
 dulls the sharpness of the pain,

1642
01:37:22,770 --> 01:37:26,470
but never quite wears it out.

1643
01:37:26,470 --> 01:37:28,010
And it doesn't get
 washed away in time.

1644
01:37:28,010 --> 01:37:31,790
It becomes a cold hard
 lump of something.

1645
01:37:31,790 --> 01:37:33,210
And a loseable souvenir.

1646
01:37:45,930 --> 01:37:49,230
Tony told me once.

1647
01:37:49,230 --> 01:37:51,980
There's no future in
 holding on to the past.
