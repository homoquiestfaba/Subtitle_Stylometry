2
00:00:16,922 --> 00:00:24,624
The Crossing

3
00:02:03,984 --> 00:02:07,388
Winter 1776, barely six months

4
00:02:07,477 --> 00:02:11,579
from the proclamation
American independence.

5
00:02:11,906 --> 00:02:14,755
The US Army has been decimated.

6
00:02:14,848 --> 00:02:18,075
The British have run it over
in Manhattan.

7
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:22,149
German mercenaries Hessen
They killed them hundreds.

8
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:27,452
They were hardly any threat
British Empire.

9
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:32,791
Before the winter they were in a cold,
Tired and sick.

10
00:02:33,215 --> 00:02:36,962
And the British got them
still further south,

11
00:02:37,296 --> 00:02:42,251
according to the natural boundary between
New Jersey and Pennsylvania:

12
00:02:42,461 --> 00:02:45,476
Say Delaware.

13
00:03:55,298 --> 00:03:58,808
Move that cannon. Try it.

14
00:04:01,531 --> 00:04:04,938
Help! Damn it, hold on!

15
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,863
Let's go!

16
00:04:09,645 --> 00:04:12,874
Ready? One two Three! Dignier!

17
00:04:15,376 --> 00:04:18,293
One two Three! Dignier!

18
00:04:19,784 --> 00:04:24,717
Mr. Hamilton? -Generale, why
Are you here? The British are everywhere.

19
00:04:25,022 --> 00:04:30,004
Damn and a top! Block
We're going further. - I understand.

20
00:04:30,815 --> 00:04:33,905
Let's go, gentlemen. Put a blockage.

21
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:36,651
Do not forget the horses.

22
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:07,286
December 7, 1776
The coast to New Jersey

23
00:05:40,928 --> 00:05:43,917
We have five hundred sick people.

24
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:49,402
We'll put them here?
- No, we'll cross the river.

25
00:05:51,356 --> 00:05:54,815
When? They will die if they are
lying in the cold.

26
00:05:54,974 --> 00:05:57,983
We will all die,
if we do not cross the river.

27
00:05:58,018 --> 00:05:59,482
Header!

28
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,578
To Glaveru, I would cross the river.

29
00:06:11,892 --> 00:06:15,189
What, sir? Let's swim?

30
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:22,505
To Glaveru, I would cross the river.

31
00:06:23,388 --> 00:06:30,837
How, sir? We have 2000 people.
Where are our ships?

32
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:36,689
The upstream is a factory. Great
the boat is transporting ore to Philadelphia.

33
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,833
Get people, get out there
and get our boats.

34
00:06:41,164 --> 00:06:44,935
What can I pay for?
Damn it, Chief, open your eyes!

35
00:06:45,248 --> 00:06:49,332
We are cluttered,
If we do not cross the river, we're done.

36
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:53,740
Get those ships.
Get them if necessary.

37
00:06:56,148 --> 00:06:59,433
In the meantime, take care of the sick.

38
00:07:04,594 --> 00:07:07,203
I understand.

39
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,381
Are you Robert McKenzie?

40
00:07:24,908 --> 00:07:28,228
You own this factory?

41
00:07:30,661 --> 00:07:33,080
Who are you?

42
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:36,528
I have the authority of the US military.

43
00:07:36,893 --> 00:07:41,469
Temporarily for you military
we are seizing boats. -What?

44
00:07:42,352 --> 00:07:45,364
God, is that your revolution?

45
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:50,294
That equality and freedom?
You're ruining a man's job!

46
00:07:51,059 --> 00:07:55,530
You're wasting your property?
- I'm listening to orders. - Whose orders?

47
00:07:56,396 --> 00:08:01,462
General Washington.
- Then God punish this bandit!

48
00:08:01,637 --> 00:08:06,616
What will I live with? Who will pay me?
-Kongres.

49
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:11,911
And you will have our lifelong
Thanks for your help.

50
00:08:16,077 --> 00:08:22,468
You and your Congress!
All of you will hang! You too!

51
00:08:23,323 --> 00:08:29,595
You will all have the consequences!
You do not have a look! Surrender yourself!

52
00:08:57,518 --> 00:09:02,985
Glider, move that boat. Here!
- The boat is moving, Mr. Hamilton!

53
00:09:03,232 --> 00:09:06,813
Let's go, gentlemen! Mr. Hamilton, faster!

54
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,583
Gentlemen.

55
00:11:51,004 --> 00:11:53,862
I'll be open.

56
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:56,733
Six months ago
our army was in New York.

57
<br> 00:11:56,768 --> 00:12:00,645
We had 20 thousand people
and 300 pieces of artillery.

58
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:05,115
How many are they ready today?
- Less than two thousand.

59
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:09,475
Henry, how many pieces do we have?
artillery? -Imainest, sir.

60
00:12:09,783 --> 00:12:13,072
Less than two thousand people,
18 cannons.

61
00:12:13,411 --> 00:12:17,602
And we would fight
against the most powerful country in the world.

62
<br> 00:12:17,788 --> 00:12:22,893
He constantly beat us and beat us.
He takes us and tramples us and punishes us.

63
00:12:25,676 --> 00:12:29,674
I have to write Congress
about our condition.

64
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:35,591
Gentlemen, what can I tell them?

65
00:12:41,024 --> 00:12:47,001
Say we're on the west coast.
And the British are on the east.

66
00:12:47,228 --> 00:12:51,392
And there is no proper boat
which is not in your hands.

67
00:12:51,825 --> 00:12:57,032
We have the advantage of several days
or Sunday, until the river is freezing.

68
00:12:57,295 --> 00:13:02,848
And when 20,000 Britons crossed over?
- Then we'll retire again.

69
00:13:03,224 --> 00:13:08,372
And open them to Philadelphia.
What's left? - We are.

70
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:12,237
We do not have food, medicine or blankets.

71
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:18,301
I'm more a doctor than a general.
We have a jaundice and a dysentery.

72
00:13:19,656 --> 00:13:23,617
So, in what condition are we?

73
00:13:24,901 --> 00:13:30,773
You are right, General Merser,
The army can not stock it.

74
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:35,203
I suggest we endure it.

75
00:13:35,427 --> 00:13:38,773
That's why we will find what we need.

76
00:13:42,678 --> 00:13:47,364
What is the alternative, gentlemen?
To lay down a weapon?

77
00:13:47,672 --> 00:13:51,965
Let's give it up
an enemy to grace? No.

78
00:13:53,319 --> 00:13:56,984
While I command, we will try our best.

79
00:13:58,592 --> 00:14:01,678
Get together.

80
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:06,546
We are here.
We got out of New York here.

81
00:14:06,677 --> 00:14:11,321
This way I shared. General
Leo 2000 people and this direction.

82
00:14:11,621 --> 00:14:14,934
General Gates
1200 people and this direction.

83
00:14:15,132 --> 00:14:20,745
If they stop an army,
the other two will not. We meet here.

84
00:14:21,434 --> 00:14:24,614
And where are they?

85
00:14:24,876 --> 00:14:28,957
How two armies
can I just disappear?

86
<br> 00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:39,036
Stirling, you're in charge
for New Jersey. Find them. - I understand.

87
00:14:40,263 --> 00:14:44,223
Keep working, gentlemen.
- I understand.

88
00:14:56,059 --> 00:15:02,480
Perhaps Lee just sits and waits
that you and your army are gone.

89
00:15:03,828 --> 00:15:09,637
I do not want to believe that. - He is
and Gates hates you. - Yes, William.

90
00:15:09,921 --> 00:15:13,604
I will not leave
until I say everything openly.

91
<br> 00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:19,624
Li wants your place. It's the easiest
to let you lose him.

92
00:15:20,277 --> 00:15:25,688
I'm just asking you to find him.
- And what if she tells me I'm losing?

93
00:15:25,726 --> 00:15:29,691
Sullivan is his deputy.
There may be problems with Lee.

94
00:15:29,878 --> 00:15:34,736
You and Salivan will arrest him,
and bring his men to me.

95
00:15:36,711 --> 00:15:39,951
You are general Washington?
-I did.

96
00:15:41,939 --> 00:15:46,442
I'm Thomas Barclay.
That stone house is mine.

97
00:15:47,052 --> 00:15:52,445
I've come to offer it to you
for the headquarters and refuge from the cold.

98
00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:57,712
You can not fight like animals
in the wild. -Thank you from your heart.

99
00:15:58,072 --> 00:16:04,124
Let your officers join us
at dinner. - He'll be honored.

100
00:16:05,455 --> 00:16:07,998
Here you go.

101
<br> 00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:15,344
Find General Lee
and his people. More tonight.

102
00:16:15,962 --> 00:16:18,799
Otherwise, we're done.

103
<br> 00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:38,471
People are wearing summer uniforms,
and many are barefoot.

104
<br> 00:16:38,506 --> 00:16:45,416
Although permanent requests are tiring,
Please congress for understanding.

105
<br> 00:16:45,487 --> 00:16:48,676
Today is December 20th.

106
00:16:48,711 --> 00:16:54,946
Mobilization takes place within 11 days
and half the guys will go home.

107
00:16:54,981 --> 00:17:03,003
I have nothing to pay for them,
and I do not have food or clothes.

108
00:17:03,438 --> 00:17:12,966
I do not know how to go without money
and please help us.

109
00:17:22,686 --> 00:17:29,093
Come on, Alex.
I'm tired, I'll rest. - I understand.

110
<br> 00:18:10,954 --> 00:18:14,045
Yes?
- He is.

111
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,066
It's open.

112
00:18:28,213 --> 00:18:30,687
Then, Hugh?

113
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:36,686
An intelligence messenger came
data. -What are the data?

114
00:18:37,552 --> 00:18:40,892
What is?
-Do you want to read this?

115
00:18:41,903 --> 00:18:44,698
It's from Van Hagen.

116
00:18:45,033 --> 00:18:47,639
Van Hagen?

117
<br> 00:18:48,017 --> 00:18:52,448
A Dutch merchant who hates
British. What does he tell us now?

118
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:57,154
General Hau sucks some lady
Loring. Every night they are together.

119
00:18:57,352 --> 00:19:00,798
His eyes are glassy
and completely general as a 15-year-old.

120
<br> 00:19:01,164 --> 00:19:05,072
I'm so glad, Hugh,
But why is it important?

121
<br> 00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,040
Looks like Mrs. Loring
responsible for our survival.

122
<br> 00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:15,268
He would have been with 20 thousand people
here on the river. He thinks we're done.

123
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:19,321
It's already Cornwall
sent to England. -Budala.

124
00:19:19,588 --> 00:19:23,746
Kornvolas is his only commander
who is not an idiot.

125
00:19:24,094 --> 00:19:26,948
They are waiting for the river to freeze.

126
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:31,882
Colonel Ral is
with 1,200 Hezeknes occupied Trenton.

127
<br> 00:19:31,917 --> 00:19:37,561
They are careful not to go to Boston.
-1200 Guyana?

128
<br> 00:19:37,596 --> 00:19:42,027
For God's sake, he despises us!
- For the reason, sir.

129
00:19:42,062 --> 00:19:47,835
For a reason? - We do not even have a thousand
boys, no food, no clothes.

130
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:50,460
The Hessenians are the best
soldiers in the world.

131
<br> 00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:55,408
Our fears are like Salem
pastor when he saw the witch.

132
00:19:55,771 --> 00:20:01,714
Hessens. -Van Hagen writes to Hau
expected to surrender in two weeks.

133
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:06,388
And he will be generous.
- Large?

134
<br> 00:20:07,753 --> 00:20:14,291
I'll go to hell before
than to surrender to Hau.

135
00:20:14,326 --> 00:20:16,850
Come on, Hugh.

136
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:22,534
Where? - Let's go look at Trenton.
I've never seen this place.

137
00:20:23,047 --> 00:20:26,326
Now, sir?
- Yeah, Hugh, now.

138
<br> 00:20:55,617 --> 00:21:00,056
It's not a river.
- Less than a Descendant.

139
00:21:01,221 --> 00:21:05,053
To have courage,
they would make an abortion and cross it.

140
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:08,115
They do not have to. They can wait.

141
<br> 00:21:13,263 --> 00:21:20,251
1200 Guyana. - And the elite regiment
who rocked us at Brooklyn.

142
00:21:20,286 --> 00:21:23,762
Killers of your Virginia people.
- Listen.

143
00:21:26,688 --> 00:21:28,976
What do you hear?

144
00:21:29,222 --> 00:21:33,202
We were scared we were alone
Down here. Go. - Quiet.

145
<br> 00:21:36,703 --> 00:21:41,088
These are ours, Hugh.
- Some drinks. - You're wrong.

146
00:21:56,310 --> 00:22:01,716
General Salivan. General Stirling.
-Generale Washington.

147
00:22:01,751 --> 00:22:06,559
Where is General Lee?
- The British have it.

148
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:10,403
How did this happen?

149
<br> 00:22:10,438 --> 00:22:16,298
We walked in, he left
in a tavern 3.5 kilometers away.

150
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:22,181
He was captured there
or joined them. - I got it.

151
00:22:24,098 --> 00:22:30,510
What kind of people are you in the state of affairs?
-872 walking, the rest on the stretcher.

152
00:22:30,545 --> 00:22:33,748
And what do you know about General Gates?

153
00:22:34,294 --> 00:22:37,866
He'll be here till night.
- Good.

154
00:22:40,066 --> 00:22:43,184
It's five o'clock now.

155
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:49,425
Send people to our camp,
if they can walk. - I can do it.

156
00:22:50,331 --> 00:22:55,923
Go with them, Hugh. We'll meet you.
- You will not be with us? -No.

157
00:23:25,556 --> 00:23:28,602
There. This is all.

158
00:23:28,989 --> 00:23:31,775
Do you want my opinion?

159
<br> 00:23:32,097 --> 00:23:36,524
Open and honest.
- I think you're out of your mind.

160
00:23:36,794 --> 00:23:41,256
You're open, Colonel Glaver,
but it does not matter now.

161
00:23:41,623 --> 00:23:44,408
The question is can you do that?

162
00:23:44,657 --> 00:23:47,622
I can not. But I'll do it.

163
<br> 00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:52,806
What does that mean to you?
-It means that this whole idea is crazy.

164
<br> 00:23:53,034 --> 00:23:58,506
But if you decide to go
In hell, my fishermen will be with you.

165
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:06,919
When everything is gathered, alternatives
and no, right? -I think no.

166
00:24:08,726 --> 00:24:11,919
Then it will be.

167
00:24:19,707 --> 00:24:22,732
Header?
- You go?

168
00:24:25,989 --> 00:24:30,198
Thank you.
-Thanks when everything is over.

169
00:24:39,584 --> 00:24:45,084
Let's not talk about defeat anymore.
Our side will triumph.

170
00:24:45,499 --> 00:24:49,296
And General Noks will then
write a book about it.

171
00:24:49,614 --> 00:24:53,566
I'm selling books, ma'am.
I would not know how to write it.

172
00:24:53,876 --> 00:24:58,584
Maybe General Header could.
- Lieutenant. It's too generous.

173
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:02,175
I am not a writer, I am a fisherman.

174
00:25:02,547 --> 00:25:06,629
Be sure, ma'am,
it will not fail to tell you.

175
00:25:07,603 --> 00:25:12,512
I noticed that your uniform was yours
different. -That's not uniform.

176
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:18,204
It's my clothes. And this is it
my hair, as God has given me.

177
00:25:18,797 --> 00:25:24,217
Because of this gentleman I will not be despised
according to anglican church.

178
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:28,271
We share it
what we are fighting for.

179
00:25:28,563 --> 00:25:33,767
But I will not wear silk and lace
nor be a fool with a wig.

180
00:25:34,029 --> 00:25:37,355
I'm a fisherman and a baptist, ma'am.

181
00:25:37,668 --> 00:25:41,264
So I was born, so I will die.

182
00:25:41,608 --> 00:25:46,659
I will not apologize, just explain
the speech of Colonel Glaver was open.

183
00:25:46,972 --> 00:25:51,090
He never shifts.

184
00:25:52,026 --> 00:25:57,740
He does not strive for beauty.
- Not really, ma'am. I am the debtor.

185
00:25:58,042 --> 00:26:03,189
God, I've experienced an apology
John Header. - I did not apologize.

186
<br> 00:26:03,508 --> 00:26:08,203
I thanked the lady for lunch and wine,
Unlike all of you.

187
00:26:08,563 --> 00:26:13,626
General Gates arrived with the soldiers.
Bad will, in the room.

188
00:26:13,945 --> 00:26:16,914
Bring him, Alex.
- I understand.

189
00:26:18,228 --> 00:26:24,214
Presbyterian, Mr. Noks.
-G. Barkley, we are constantly bothering you.

190
00:26:25,332 --> 00:26:29,081
How that?
- General Gates just arrived.

191
00:26:31,096 --> 00:26:35,047
I'll meet you.
My colleague, General Gates.

192
00:26:37,186 --> 00:26:40,168
Welcome. Did you eat?
-I did.

193
00:26:40,648 --> 00:26:45,321
Can we use it tonight?
this room? - Sure.

194
00:26:51,168 --> 00:26:56,384
Sit down, General. Drink wine.
Stay, sit down, gentlemen.

195
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:03,319
It's too late, but maybe not too late.

196
<br> 00:27:12,165 --> 00:27:17,038
We had already held a meeting, but
I wanted to come and General Gates.

197
<br> 00:27:17,171 --> 00:27:21,158
I'm still from the Congress yesterday
got this note.

198
00:27:22,437 --> 00:27:26,933
Supreme Commander,
General Washington.

199
00:27:27,382 --> 00:27:33,237
Congress moves to Baltimore
because Philadelphia can not be defended.

200
<br> 00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:42,384
We leave you your salted hands
in deciding on further struggle.

201
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,364
There, gentlemen.

202
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:58,497
Six months ago, on July 4,
we became a state.

203
00:27:59,569 --> 00:28:04,526
We held the three largest cities,
Boston, New York and Philadelphia.

204
00:28:04,877 --> 00:28:08,024
We lost New York since then.

205
00:28:08,251 --> 00:28:12,757
Because of the impossibility of the Congress
he withdrew from Philadelphia.

206
<br> 00:28:13,157 --> 00:28:18,836
We lost all the battles,
we only got a handful of soldiers.

207
00:28:20,451 --> 00:28:23,445
The British have written off.

208
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:28,216
They're just imagining
the conditions of our surrender.

209
00:28:28,702 --> 00:28:34,794
They're waiting for Delaware to freeze
and then they will hand over those conditions to us.

210
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:39,488
You have clearly described the situation.
- Good.

211
00:28:42,367 --> 00:28:46,542
Keep your mind,
Gentlemen, now listen to me.

212
<br> 00:28:47,114 --> 00:28:52,083
Over the river, 16 kilometers
downtown is Trenton.

213
00:28:52,289 --> 00:28:56,393
It's kept by 1200 of the Hensens
under Ral's command.

214
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:01,316
They have food, warm clothes,
tents, weapons, ammunition.

215
00:29:01,543 --> 00:29:04,928
In short, everything we need.

216
00:29:05,263 --> 00:29:11,709
In four days, Christmas,
The Hesenites will celebrate and drink day and night.

217
<br> 00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:20,721
I want to 25th in the evening
we cross the river and enter Trenton.

218
00:29:21,988 --> 00:29:25,419
Hessence will attack before dawn.

219
00:29:26,054 --> 00:29:29,969
If God is with us,
We'll capture them all.

220
00:29:43,456 --> 00:29:48,566
I waited for you to come,
to suggest this to you. What do you say?

221
00:29:48,816 --> 00:29:51,619
You better not know.

222
00:29:51,964 --> 00:29:56,862
So, you have remarks? -Many.
-Do you specify? -Rado.

223
<br> 00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:03,080
First, you need an army to attack.
You do not have an army.

224
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:09,487
Secondly, you need soldiers for the attack.
Your guys are not soldiers.

225
00:30:11,408 --> 00:30:16,837
Thirdly, your strengths go only
in one direction. The attack is the opposite.

226
<br> 00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:20,200
Continue?
- Of course.

227
00:30:20,726 --> 00:30:25,764
Mobilization expires in 11 days.
Why should the boys attack then?

228
00:30:25,989 --> 00:30:29,242
They better sit quietly and go home.

229
00:30:29,462 --> 00:30:33,791
It is impossible to cross the river,
and that the Hessens do not find out.

230
00:30:33,947 --> 00:30:38,073
Spies are everywhere.
The transition will take hours.

231
00:30:38,251 --> 00:30:42,877
Their cannons will welcome you
long before you cross.

232
00:30:43,218 --> 00:30:48,987
Your boats are a great target.
Nor would the Norther miss them.

233
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:57,779
And finally, you will not defeat Hessence.
These are European soldiers.

234
00:30:59,556 --> 00:31:04,547
The most disciplined,
best dressed, and you know that well.

235
00:31:05,393 --> 00:31:10,906
Their supremacy ... - There will be a drawback.
- Please, sir.

236
00:31:11,149 --> 00:31:14,294
They're not dressed for such an attack.

237
00:31:14,547 --> 00:31:19,941
We'll kick them out of bed,
they will not get organized.

238
00:31:20,661 --> 00:31:25,605
I'm afraid for your common sense,
you are no longer a commander.

239
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:29,516
How dare you?
- No, how dare you?

240
00:31:29,979 --> 00:31:33,692
I already have enough of your intentions.

241
00:31:34,181 --> 00:31:39,858
And I'm sick of a false military skill
you and your company.

242
00:31:41,174 --> 00:31:44,178
You are not soldiers.

243
00:31:46,303 --> 00:31:52,594
And you are a bad commander. You're afraid
it is defeated, and you want destruction.

244
00:31:54,425 --> 00:31:59,629
Have you finished?
- Let's face it, the revolution is over.

245
<br> 00:32:03,102 --> 00:32:09,041
So, we'll surrender. Take off
We are all and reason has prevailed.

246
00:32:11,104 --> 00:32:16,911
But I'm unreasonable, except what
I'm a bad soldier. You're right.

247
00:32:17,149 --> 00:32:22,317
My guys are not soldiers.
They have 16, 17, 18 years.

248
00:32:23,253 --> 00:32:28,006
Beige. Guyana is afraid of death.
It's all true.

249
00:32:28,993 --> 00:32:33,358
But they believe in me.

250
00:32:34,241 --> 00:32:39,182
They could desert,
Thousands are, but these guys are not.

251
00:32:40,447 --> 00:32:45,981
They stay with me. Generale,
I command the army, not you.

252
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:51,992
And if I bring them to hell,
they will be in hell after me!

253
00:32:56,286 --> 00:32:59,349
So listen to me well.

254
<br> 00:33:00,066 --> 00:33:06,062
You will leave the camp, not with anyone
you will not talk about this.

255
00:33:07,438 --> 00:33:12,087
Blow the pistol at him, Alex,
Get him off, let him go.

256
<br> 00:33:12,441 --> 00:33:18,531
If he wants to take soldiers,
Kill him. - You would not dare.

257
00:33:21,001 --> 00:33:24,785
Check out, General Gates.

258
00:33:32,999 --> 00:33:37,125
Go with him, Alex, but quickly
come back. We have a lot of work.

259
00:33:43,302 --> 00:33:48,104
This is not fun, gentlemen.
- Of course not. Gates is right.

260
00:33:48,505 --> 00:33:53,567
If the Hesenas find out about this,
We'll all go to hell.

261
00:33:53,938 --> 00:33:57,179
Right. Now listen to me well.

262
00:33:57,364 --> 00:34:01,964
We have only one day to prepare
something we have not yet tried.

263
<br> 00:34:02,172 --> 00:34:07,139
Sorry, but we have fought.
- We were defeated and defeated.

264
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:11,186
At Christmas we attack for the first time.

265
00:34:25,762 --> 00:34:30,916
I will not drive your cannon while mine
People do not cross. - You're stubborn.

266
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:35,913
We need guns for the attack.
- I will not fight the dealers.

267
00:34:36,302 --> 00:34:39,283
Get out of the rain, Mr. Noks.

268
00:34:39,846 --> 00:34:45,429
For transportation of cannons and horses
we'll put a platform on two boats.

269
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:50,533
We'll build boats
thick wooden wedges.

270
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:55,815
Twenty of my fishermen
holders on each platform. - What do you want?

271
00:34:56,081 --> 00:35:00,114
We need five boats
for the transport of people. What then?

272
<br> 00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:05,067
We'll waste time on dismantling
platform, and people will wait?

273
<br> 00:35:05,454 --> 00:35:12,458
Think a bit, Mr. Noks. -Glaveru,
You are a barbaric barber. - That's it.

274
00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:19,672
It's a civilized guy.
It's shining on this cold.

275
<br> 00:35:26,182 --> 00:35:30,155
We'll cross near
McConkey's scaffolding.

276
00:35:30,494 --> 00:35:34,754
Then we'll split
in two columns and at night enter Trenton.

277
00:35:35,035 --> 00:35:39,612
You have two days to determine who
what will. Tell people how much less.

278
00:35:39,885 --> 00:35:44,333
Tell them to run
when we prepare the passage, not before.

279
00:35:45,803 --> 00:35:50,937
Any questions? -My people
They need guns. - How much?

280
00:35:51,503 --> 00:35:56,056
Maybe hundreds. - You'll get ten.
The rest of the muskets and bayonets.

281
00:35:56,385 --> 00:36:02,418
General, they're shooters.
They will not land on muskets.

282
00:36:03,517 --> 00:36:08,153
They will not agree to Hesen
they kill. Look around, Captain.

283
<br> 00:36:08,362 --> 00:36:14,428
Better and musket than a rifle that
Do not shoot. That night we all go together.

284
00:36:19,222 --> 00:36:22,000
Yes, captain Hajnaman?

285
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:26,555
My guys are good and brave
Germans from Pennsylvania.

286
00:36:26,853 --> 00:36:31,879
But for them, the Hesenas are the devil themselves.

287
00:36:33,393 --> 00:36:36,302
Devil.

288
00:36:36,981 --> 00:36:43,579
If I tell them the last time
for Hessence, he'll be nervous.

289
00:36:46,465 --> 00:36:50,734
If I tell them today,
we can talk.

290
00:36:51,635 --> 00:36:55,739
It's better for everyone this way.

291
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:03,364
What do you think?
- He's telling them. No danger.

292
00:37:03,672 --> 00:37:06,710
Nobody understands them anyway.

293
00:37:25,214 --> 00:37:28,738
What are you smoking?
- Dried cow balloon.

294
00:37:32,728 --> 00:37:35,826
What's the taste?
- Like a shit.

295
00:37:37,593 --> 00:37:40,977
Is that yours?
- Corn.

296
00:37:42,066 --> 00:37:45,887
Remember tobacco?
- Yes.

297
00:37:49,761 --> 00:37:53,569
You made a terrible mess.
Why all this?

298
00:37:53,967 --> 00:37:57,668
I hope so
prevent water penetration.

299
00:37:58,016 --> 00:38:01,695
I do not want to fight
with a damp drum.

300
<br> 00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:06,211
You will not succeed.

301
00:38:29,184 --> 00:38:31,807
McConny?

302
00:38:32,031 --> 00:38:35,093
General, it's a great honor.

303
00:38:35,351 --> 00:38:40,709
Let's go somewhere else.
- Let's stay, this is confidential.

304
00:38:41,931 --> 00:38:45,489
How you want. But please, sit down.

305
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:51,846
I always imagined you were coming
and look for a bottle of Madera.

306
00:38:52,692 --> 00:38:56,843
McConnell, there is no Madera
from here to Philadelphia.

307
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:02,438
Thank you.

308
<br> 00:39:14,236 --> 00:39:20,328
I did not try this like this for a year.
- It's yours. - Drink with me. -No no.

309
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:24,457
No drops. This is just yours.

310
00:39:25,726 --> 00:39:28,861
So, what you wanted
to talk?

311
<br> 00:39:30,447 --> 00:39:35,686
I hear you do not like our enemies.
- I'd kill them all!

312
<br> 00:39:36,175 --> 00:39:40,207
And do you know that you're silent?
- Like a dead man. - Good.

313
<br> 00:39:41,834 --> 00:39:45,844
Tomorrow I need this house, all day.

314
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:49,137
This will be my headquarters.

315
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:54,417
I'll cross the river
with two thousand people and attack.

316
00:39:57,023 --> 00:40:01,223
Bastards in Trenton?
- Yes, the bastards in Trenton.

317
00:40:03,799 --> 00:40:07,334
General, can I, however,
to drink a little?

318
00:40:09,261 --> 00:40:14,632
When you arrived, you did not notice
Ice on the river? - They do not mind us.

319
00:40:15,693 --> 00:40:20,198
Not now, but Delaware
a strange and tumultuous river.

320
00:40:20,683 --> 00:40:25,261
The frost came and covered everything
to the valley in the north.

321
00:40:25,524 --> 00:40:31,072
It will freeze for a day or two,
and then it will be worse.

322
00:40:32,273 --> 00:40:35,750
We're crossing tomorrow.
- For God's sake, General!

323
00:40:36,231 --> 00:40:40,987
Excuse me for the audacity,
But why do not you wait for the spring?

324
00:40:41,387 --> 00:40:46,886
I believe in the same thing, I love
That army. - And me, more than anything.

325
00:40:47,918 --> 00:40:54,069
Why do not you wait? - If we do not move
Tomorrow there will be no more troops.

326
00:41:17,388 --> 00:41:19,859
Yes?

327
00:41:24,917 --> 00:41:28,737
It's Christmas, sir.
Happy to you, Christmas.

328
00:41:32,051 --> 00:41:34,485
Thank you.

329
00:41:36,479 --> 00:41:41,966
Always shave with cold water?
- I have to get used to it.

330
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,685
It's true. If we go.

331
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:52,232
We're crossing, Chief. Tonight.

332
00:41:59,065 --> 00:42:05,310
May I ask something? - Would you
Did not you say no? -I would not.

333
00:42:06,541 --> 00:42:12,181
Then, of course, to Gloucester. Say it.
- Would you attack Hessence in the afternoon?

334
00:42:15,695 --> 00:42:19,375
A stupid question, I do not intend to.

335
00:42:20,557 --> 00:42:24,932
But would you?
- Talk, openly. - Good.

336
00:42:25,786 --> 00:42:30,374
Let's say the boats
Prepare until 17.30. It's already night.

337
00:42:30,736 --> 00:42:34,011
We're left six and a half hours
to cross.

338
00:42:34,316 --> 00:42:39,756
Mash at midnight. People will be
Cold, it will be wet and tired.

339
00:42:40,396 --> 00:42:44,879
With three kilometers per hour,
We arrive in Trenton before dawn.

340
00:42:45,322 --> 00:42:50,656
We'll go five an hour. - Maybe,
I'm not saying that you will not even want to.

341
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:57,171
But such an army can not
to get ice for 6 or 10 hours.

342
00:42:58,479 --> 00:43:03,919
So you'll be in Trenton for a day.
If we even cross the damn river.

343
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:12,947
What did you say last time?
-Please? - If we go anyway.

344
00:43:15,913 --> 00:43:18,964
Header?
-Yes?

345
00:43:19,624 --> 00:43:27,927
Since I've known you,
You're bothering me and torturing me.

346
00:43:28,614 --> 00:43:33,688
You'd be a general not to torture
and all the others. - I do not care about that.

347
00:43:34,217 --> 00:43:38,379
We need more soldiers, not generals.
- The truth.

348
00:43:43,748 --> 00:43:46,798
You're a hard man.

349
00:43:50,081 --> 00:43:56,019
But you saved us to Brooklyn,
on the Frogs to the North and the North.

350
00:43:57,247 --> 00:44:01,196
You are brave of anyone I know.

351
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:06,055
And you're a great soldier.

352
00:44:06,468 --> 00:44:12,227
So this is the command, if you will not
to return people to Massachusetts.

353
00:44:12,586 --> 00:44:17,518
Or where did you come from?
So, execute the command.

354
00:44:17,828 --> 00:44:22,310
Transfer me an army
across the river, and this night.

355
00:44:23,851 --> 00:44:28,914
I understand, General,
I'll transport you army across the river.

356
00:44:29,509 --> 00:44:34,122
So, God,
I do not know how, but I will do it.

357
00:44:35,966 --> 00:44:41,501
I'm not going to Trenton
until all boats pass.

358
00:44:42,903 --> 00:44:47,492
I want your fishermen to be with me.
-I will.

359
00:45:17,684 --> 00:45:21,707
Are you ready?
- Yes, and you? -I did.

360
<br> 00:47:08,846 --> 00:47:14,397
Gentlemen, you know the whole plan.
I will repeat the main elements.

361
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:21,068
It's now 17.10. We start embarking
for exactly twenty minutes.

362
00:47:22,059 --> 00:47:28,249
When we cross, we march south
and we split into two wings.

363
00:47:29,412 --> 00:47:34,420
Green and I are commanding the first
and we're going to Penington.

364
00:47:34,594 --> 00:47:38,902
General Salivan leads the other wing
and it goes by the River.

365
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:43,665
Akobogda, we will enter Trenton
at six o'clock in the morning.

366
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:47,013
It will still be dark.

367
00:47:49,401 --> 00:47:53,771
You wanted something, Colonel Glaver?
- Yes, sir.

368
00:47:53,986 --> 00:47:58,093
Gentlemen, on boarding and landing
I'm looking for discipline and speed.

369
00:47:58,369 --> 00:48:03,067
There is no interference in the work of my people,
One will be in each boat.

370
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:08,850
What they say is a law,
for a soldier or general of Washington.

371
00:48:09,293 --> 00:48:12,170
He will be the chief.

372
00:48:12,406 --> 00:48:17,637
By commanding, I command.
Sir, confirm that.

373
00:48:18,402 --> 00:48:23,586
You heard the colonel. He orders
loading and unloading.

374
00:48:24,711 --> 00:48:28,190
His orders
Everyone has to listen.

375
00:48:30,734 --> 00:48:33,799
Any questions?

376
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:46,129
Good.

377
00:48:46,685 --> 00:48:53,904
I wish you all the help of God,
a lot of luck and a happy Christmas. -Also.

378
00:49:01,308 --> 00:49:04,017
Faster!

379
00:49:05,284 --> 00:49:07,829
Another one here.

380
<br> 00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:13,363
Three here. Easy. Look out, son.
-Thank you. -Polako.

381
00:49:22,364 --> 00:49:25,251
Go!

382
<br> 00:49:28,179 --> 00:49:32,440
General.
- Hugh, go over and close the other side.

383
00:49:32,879 --> 00:49:35,838
When we disembark, expand the circle.

384
00:49:37,769 --> 00:49:40,656
What time is it, Alex?

385
00:49:41,468 --> 00:49:46,264
18.10.
-Presses are. Get me Glaver.

386
00:49:48,169 --> 00:49:50,735
Go!

387
00:49:53,363 --> 00:49:59,662
Gentlemen, the soldiers are cold,
You must be with them, not with fire!

388
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:09,222
General.
- Can you speed them up? -I can not.

389
00:50:09,492 --> 00:50:13,873
We have places for only two boats
simultaneously. I told you ...

390
00:50:14,075 --> 00:50:17,187
Good. Get back to work.

391
00:50:24,331 --> 00:50:26,722
Come back.

392
00:50:27,432 --> 00:50:30,462
It's alive. Cheers!

393
00:50:34,226 --> 00:50:39,552
Captain, send me people.
Do not stop embarking.

394
00:50:40,571 --> 00:50:44,511
Let's go, easy, guys. Faster!

395
00:50:45,202 --> 00:50:49,309
Alex, what time is it?
-Around 22.00, sir.

396
00:50:56,373 --> 00:51:00,078
General. I'll get over.

397
00:51:01,395 --> 00:51:05,700
On the other side is a thousand guys.
Come on, Nathaniel.

398
00:51:05,994 --> 00:51:11,887
You stay here? - No, I'm going to get mad
From watching, I'm going to go over.

399
00:51:12,933 --> 00:51:17,288
I would have gone too far.
- Why do not you wait for guns?

400
00:51:17,629 --> 00:51:21,890
If I mention the cannons again,
Glaver will go crazy.

401
00:51:22,718 --> 00:51:27,334
Hates me. I was about it
with him to talk, but ...

402
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:32,692
He insulted me.
- How?

403
00:51:33,214 --> 00:51:37,570
He said the army
She did not eat for three months.

404
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:42,323
And that betrayal is when someone is fat.

405
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,310
Oh really?

406
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:56,537
Come on, Henry, this is not night
for lunch. In the boats. - I understand.

407
00:52:00,076 --> 00:52:03,900
Go with General Green and Noks.
I'll be right back.

408
00:52:04,222 --> 00:52:08,742
I'll command from the shore.
Wait until the last boat.

409
00:52:08,994 --> 00:52:13,940
Regardless of time and everything else,
Everyone has to cross.

410
<br> 00:52:14,645 --> 00:52:19,353
We'll cross and march to Trenton.
There is no debate about it.

411
00:52:19,665 --> 00:52:23,228
We are crossing and attacking.
- I understand.

412
00:52:24,214 --> 00:52:28,204
Okay, I'll see you on the other side.

413
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:51,162
They are, your head, start them.
-Without worry, we'll all go.

414
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:56,499
Move your fat ass, Henry.

415
00:52:59,423 --> 00:53:02,416
What did he say?
-My fat ass.

416
00:53:03,474 --> 00:53:06,821
Do not move because you will sink the boat.

417
00:53:10,091 --> 00:53:12,398
Go!

418
00:53:46,182 --> 00:53:51,508
Easy, guys. Save power.
You'll need it before dawn.

419
00:54:00,472 --> 00:54:04,330
God, they're so slow.
Can we speed them up?

420
00:54:04,563 --> 00:54:10,209
We cross once, they all night.
And there's still a march on Trenton.

421
<br> 00:54:10,737 --> 00:54:15,613
Easy, guys.
All together. Abe, give me a rhythm!

422
00:55:01,492 --> 00:55:04,192
Align the boat.

423
00:55:15,944 --> 00:55:18,550
Closer!

424
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:32,381
How's it going, Hugh? - Better, since
does not fall snow. The guys are sleeping. - Okay.

425
00:55:32,765 --> 00:55:35,760
They will need their strength.

426
00:55:36,375 --> 00:55:39,628
23.10.
- It's clear now.

427
00:55:40,122 --> 00:55:43,270
The army will not cross three o'clock in the morning.

428
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:48,260
Which means we will not reach Trenton
before dawn. You must agree.

429
00:55:48,535 --> 00:55:52,677
I agree.
- Then what? - We'll be missing in a day.

430
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:57,541
How is the outer edge standing?

431
00:55:57,931 --> 00:56:03,707
There are three hundred on the edge.
We picked up about ten people from the farms.

432
00:56:05,181 --> 00:56:10,612
Curious. I think they are innocent.
- I'll talk to them.

433
00:56:12,931 --> 00:56:18,162
A friend, we know each other well.
We've done a lot together.

434
00:56:18,734 --> 00:56:22,982
But how are we going to Trenton in the afternoon,
and Hessen we expect?

435
00:56:23,552 --> 00:56:27,482
You know that would be the end.
-Hugh.

436
00:56:29,373 --> 00:56:33,670
They set me up for the supreme
the commander of the great army.

437
00:56:34,133 --> 00:56:38,049
And now I command
to those who are left.

438
00:56:38,904 --> 00:56:43,355
I missed everything,
All the attempts have failed me.

439
00:56:43,755 --> 00:56:49,719
These are not empty words.
If necessary, I'll sneak into Trenton myself.

440
00:57:13,019 --> 00:57:15,883
Places, gentlemen.

441
00:57:16,907 --> 00:57:20,623
I'm General Washington.
- Why did you capture us?

442
00:57:21,664 --> 00:57:24,856
Please, listen to me.
Listen to me!

443
00:57:25,615 --> 00:57:29,410
For which hour we begin
march south to Trenton.

444
00:57:29,773 --> 00:57:33,816
If he finds out about it,
Hundreds of my people will be gone.

445
00:57:34,057 --> 00:57:38,764
You'll be in custody for three hours
from the beginning of the march. Then we're letting you go.

446
00:57:39,182 --> 00:57:43,402
I'm sorry that you are suffering,
but we all suffer.

447
00:57:57,996 --> 00:58:03,716
Three and a half hours till dawn. - Damn,
I know! Do not mention more time.

448
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:34,230
General.

449
00:58:36,858 --> 00:58:39,388
It is over.

450
00:58:40,473 --> 00:58:42,873
They all crossed.

451
00:58:45,013 --> 00:58:49,624
Prepare people, Alex, we are not losing
time. We're going in ten minutes.

452
00:58:49,777 --> 00:58:53,135
To units, gentlemen.
- I understand. -Glaveru!

453
00:58:53,564 --> 00:58:57,891
How are your fishermen?
- They're tired, but they'll march.

454
00:58:58,526 --> 00:59:02,403
How are they armed?
-Ribar spikes.

455
00:59:04,292 --> 00:59:07,615
You lead the Sullivan's wing.

456
<br> 00:59:09,038 --> 00:59:10,460
Alright, guys. Live!

457
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:27,084
Wake up, live.
Take the muskets, gentlemen.

458
00:59:27,576 --> 00:59:30,414
Header.

459
00:59:31,282 --> 00:59:33,906
Thank you.

460
00:59:46,879 --> 00:59:50,992
Colonel Glaver, will he
These muskets shoot? - It will not.

461
00:59:51,281 --> 00:59:54,686
Let's just go with the bayonets.
-That's right.

462
00:59:55,305 --> 00:59:59,116
The Hesen barrel is dry.
- And that's it.

463
01:01:00,835 --> 01:01:03,163
Hold it.

464
01:01:09,465 --> 01:01:11,616
Alex.

465
01:01:14,511 --> 01:01:19,558
Wait here. Let Salivan
recognizes the path. - I understand.

466
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:25,163
Run the cannons, Henry.
-Napred. Tops ahead!

467
01:01:28,961 --> 01:01:32,178
Let them go, Nathaniel.
We can not stop.

468
01:01:32,973 --> 01:01:35,964
Warm up. Marsh!

469
01:01:52,503 --> 01:01:55,944
Let's go, guys,
Another mile and we arrived.

470
01:02:10,569 --> 01:02:13,618
Gentlemen, the way.

471
01:02:41,498 --> 01:02:47,258
Alex, it's 7.30. Tell Salivanu
to attack at 8.00. - Good.

472
<br> 01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:56,371
Go home, boy.

473
01:02:58,897 --> 01:03:01,818
Go home.

474
01:03:25,871 --> 01:03:30,422
General Salivan, we attack at 8.00.
- Is there a Gasoline engine? - No.

475
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:34,120
Akobogda, he will not even wake up.
At eight o'clock.

476
01:03:39,662 --> 01:03:42,935
Where is the Hossean guard?
-There.

477
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:50,046
You are general Washington?

478
01:03:56,111 --> 01:04:00,343
You found him?
-I did. Salivan attacks eight.

479
01:04:01,964 --> 01:04:06,693
How many are there?
- Who? -Woodies in the guardhouse.

480
01:04:08,532 --> 01:04:14,576
Four, maybe six.
But they were asleep, they glorified late.

481
01:04:15,933 --> 01:04:20,803
Let the bayonets prepare and disperse
by pasture. Attack at eight.

482
01:04:22,059 --> 01:04:25,796
Can you and Williams
to silence the guard?

483
01:04:30,358 --> 01:04:33,396
We can.
- Do it.

484
01:04:35,348 --> 01:04:38,350
Williams, with me.

485
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:27,249
It's done, sir.
- How much? - Four.

486
01:06:28,365 --> 01:06:31,240
Everyone is dead.

487
01:08:08,335 --> 01:08:11,046
Army, go ahead!

488
01:08:20,316 --> 01:08:23,414
Be with your commanders!

489
01:08:57,971 --> 01:09:00,137
Pali!

490
01:09:04,015 --> 01:09:07,058
Colonel, the enemy!

491
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:17,060
How many are there?
- I do not know, Colonel.

492
01:09:17,877 --> 01:09:22,467
Is my horse free?
- Yes.

493
01:11:34,706 --> 01:11:37,616
How many are there?
- Hundreds.

494
01:11:37,919 --> 01:11:41,246
Where is the enemy?
- Everywhere!

495
01:11:51,034 --> 01:11:54,605
Leading people to pasture!

496
01:11:57,519 --> 01:12:03,219
Set the rows! Follow me!

497
01:12:03,469 --> 01:12:07,030
Gather people!

498
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:10,749
Major, where are my cannons?

499
01:12:45,212 --> 01:12:48,288
This way, guys! To the pasture!

500
01:13:03,674 --> 01:13:07,009
Get together!

501
01:13:07,665 --> 01:13:13,084
Order yourself! Faster!

502
<br> 01:13:22,187 --> 01:13:25,274
You have to form combat lines!

503
01:13:25,423 --> 01:13:28,709
Where are my cannons, hell?

504
01:13:37,436 --> 01:13:43,067
Form the lines!
- Now, everyone is gathering here! Right now!

505
01:13:53,293 --> 01:13:56,653
Major, bring that top up here!

506
01:14:03,341 --> 01:14:06,866
I see only one cannon. Where are the others?

507
01:14:20,223 --> 01:14:23,241
Others come from behind!

508
01:14:29,249 --> 01:14:32,181
We're surrounded!

509
01:14:47,501 --> 01:14:51,001
Where are my cannons?

510
01:14:53,406 --> 01:14:56,409
Get ready to fire!

511
01:15:30,956 --> 01:15:34,664
We have to surrender.
- I understand, Colonel.

512
01:15:34,954 --> 01:15:38,201
We do not have a look. We surrender!

513
01:16:36,210 --> 01:16:41,276
General, Colonel Ral's sword.
Send it to the Congress.

514
01:16:43,930 --> 01:16:49,986
Is Ral seriously wounded? - Dead.
I sent Hajnaman to him.

515
01:17:06,345 --> 01:17:09,262
Tell him I'm a doctor.

516
01:17:22,999 --> 01:17:25,618
What did he say?

517
01:17:35,370 --> 01:17:40,895
He wants to surrender like hesen
officer. General Washington.

518
01:17:42,258 --> 01:17:45,234
You'll pretend to me.

519
01:17:51,559 --> 01:17:57,792
You have no choice.
You must surrender to General Merser.

520
01:18:02,451 --> 01:18:09,537
I'm a Hsen's officer
and I need to talk to Washington.

521
01:18:18,587 --> 01:18:22,844
Nathaniel, go to Washington.
Bring him here.

522
01:18:23,814 --> 01:18:26,881
They will not come.
- Tell him he must!

523
01:18:27,293 --> 01:18:32,530
If something can be understood, that is
then defeat. The enemy is dying.

524
01:18:32,975 --> 01:18:35,181
Tell him that.

525
01:18:48,765 --> 01:18:52,359
General Washington,
Colonel Ral dies.

526
01:18:56,907 --> 01:19:02,007
General Merser says it's a war
Usually talk to you.

527
01:19:04,413 --> 01:19:06,798
Usual?

528
01:19:07,081 --> 01:19:10,260
Not in the war of customs, Nathaniel.

529
01:19:10,482 --> 01:19:15,809
I will not bow to the mercenary
who killed me 500 people.

530
01:19:17,224 --> 01:19:22,396
He gave them a gift when they wanted to
they surrender. Shove them back with bayonets!

531
01:19:23,513 --> 01:19:28,531
Should I cry for bastards,
for people who kill for profit?

532
01:19:29,545 --> 01:19:34,275
Basically, we are fighting
against British taxes.

533
01:19:37,194 --> 01:19:40,292
In the end, we all kill to earn money.

534
01:19:40,907 --> 01:19:44,181
Both the British, and the Hessens and us.

535
01:19:57,979 --> 01:20:02,783
Then good.
Let's not turn out the savages.

536
01:20:19,110 --> 01:20:22,158
It's very weak. It will not be long.

537
01:20:24,907 --> 01:20:29,414
You are general Washington?
- Pita, did you ...

538
01:20:32,588 --> 01:20:35,591
I'm Washington.

539
01:20:47,427 --> 01:20:51,058
My soldiers are good and brave.

540
01:20:52,279 --> 01:20:57,821
Please do not steal from them.
Get their weapons.

541
01:20:58,312 --> 01:21:02,466
But leave them money and honor.

542
01:21:19,043 --> 01:21:21,273
He's dead.

543
01:21:31,622 --> 01:21:35,026
Gentlemen, how are we?
- We have their cannons.

544
01:21:35,242 --> 01:21:38,614
Six double reinforced.
Better than all of us.

545
01:21:38,852 --> 01:21:43,194
Tell Noksa to fill the guns
and get ready for the march. Something else?

546
01:21:43,273 --> 01:21:47,662
Three cartridges of ammunition, 49 hex
horses, blankets, clothes.

547
01:21:47,908 --> 01:21:51,243
About five tons of flour,
meat, corn meal.

548
01:21:51,448 --> 01:21:55,756
How many prisoners? - More than 900.
We still do not know the exact number.

549
01:21:55,990 --> 01:21:59,835
Thirty officers
and all their flags and drums.

550
01:21:59,983 --> 01:22:04,548
Find a drummer, let's follow us
on departure. Captain Hajnaman.

551
01:22:05,297 --> 01:22:08,178
You march with Hensen officers.

552
01:22:08,489 --> 01:22:13,090
With every Hessian group
Let one German speak.

553
01:22:13,576 --> 01:22:19,020
Let them say that we will kill everyone
who is running. Is that clear?

554
01:22:22,453 --> 01:22:25,524
Yes.
- Go. We're going in half an hour.

555
01:22:26,108 --> 01:22:30,616
Where are we going?
- Back to the boat and across the river.

556
01:22:34,878 --> 01:22:39,955
But people are exhausted,
sleeping on the road, in the meadows.

557
01:22:40,557 --> 01:22:44,756
Their heads are falling.
- And I'm exhausted, gentlemen.

558
01:22:45,083 --> 01:22:49,339
Listen to me.
This is our first victory in 12 months.

559
01:22:49,617 --> 01:22:55,642
We attacked for the first time. It happened
miracle, the grace of God.

560
01:22:56,284 --> 01:22:59,889
Or we survived the craziness of the war.

561
01:23:01,057 --> 01:23:04,674
What do you think? If we had a war?

562
01:23:07,023 --> 01:23:10,144
Gentlemen, the war has just begun.

563
01:23:12,402 --> 01:23:17,537
We have two thousand people.
The enemy has twenty thousand.

564
01:23:18,025 --> 01:23:23,838
I will not even eat or sleep
until the river divides us.

565
01:23:29,136 --> 01:23:33,215
Go to your people
and prepare them for march.

566
01:23:43,597 --> 01:23:45,840
Hugh.

567
01:23:48,141 --> 01:23:51,654
How many people have we lost?
-None.

568
01:23:54,110 --> 01:23:56,490
And how many wounded?

569
01:23:58,529 --> 01:24:01,457
None.

570
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:11,475
God!

571
01:24:22,849 --> 01:24:29,016
Do you know how I felt the last one
24 hours? - I can fix it.

572
01:24:30,101 --> 01:24:34,858
Like a lunatic.
Who sends these wonderful guys to death.

573
01:24:36,607 --> 01:24:40,117
All those guys who want to follow me.

574
01:24:43,445 --> 01:24:46,412
Why are they doing this?

575
01:24:47,542 --> 01:24:52,579
I suppose they trust you.
- Then there are even bigger fools.

576
01:24:54,166 --> 01:24:57,130
And they love you.

577
01:25:03,927 --> 01:25:06,427
All right, Hugh.

578
01:25:06,860 --> 01:25:13,268
Prepare your people.
- I understand.

579
01:26:31,940 --> 01:26:36,537
It will take another seven years
before the British sign peace.

580
01:26:38,219 --> 01:26:42,300
These long years
and after, in difficult times,

581
01:26:43,887 --> 01:26:47,999
The Washington army never again
it was not on the verge of collapse

582
01:26:48,034 --> 01:26:52,205
as in the weeks
on the eve of Delaver's transition.

583
01:26:52,935 --> 01:26:58,397
General Washington April 30, 1789
became the first president of the United States.

584
01:26:58,534 --> 01:27:03,536
He died on December 14, 1799.
at the age of 68.

585
01:27:06,855 --> 01:27:11,148
Washington's best friend
H. Merser died the day after.

586
01:27:11,443 --> 01:27:15,434
Washington has stopped
just for re-energizing forces

587
01:27:15,795 --> 01:27:20,040
and attack and conquer the British
Garrison in Princeton.

588
01:27:23,787 --> 01:27:27,378
Despite the inconsistency of the ranks, Glaver
He came out of the war as a general.

589
01:27:27,413 --> 01:27:31,947
He returned to Marblehead, rebuilt
and returned to his job.

590
01:27:31,982 --> 01:27:37,773
He died on January 30, 1797.
at the age of 65.

591
01:27:41,472 --> 01:27:44,958
Washington set Alexander up
Hamilton for the first Minister of Finance.

592
01:27:44,993 --> 01:27:48,004
He died on July 12, 1804.
from the consequences of a duel

593
01:27:48,039 --> 01:27:54,486
with a political opponent
Aron Buram.

594
01:28:00,273 --> 01:28:03,565
For the reign of Dž. Washington
H. Noks became Defense Minister.

595
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:09,080
Like many at that time, it's not
Long live. He died at age 56.

596
01:28:13,848 --> 01:28:17,657
Colonel Ral
Buried in Trenton.

597
01:28:17,692 --> 01:28:19,837
On his grave he writes:

598
01:28:19,872 --> 01:28:24,326
"Here lies Colonel Ral.
It's all over for him. "

599
01:28:26,195 --> 01:28:29,475
Documents show
that he is in the fight against colonies

600
01:28:29,510 --> 01:28:32,765
to America brought
a total of 16,992 Humans.

Of them 10,492
He returned to Europe in 1783.

602
01:28:38,366 --> 01:28:42,769
Of the 6500 that remained in America,
some were killed and some were wounded.

603
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:45,680
Some are probably
died from wounding.

604
01:28:45,663 --> 01:28:51,605
But most of them became Americans
and they lived there.
