1
00:02:21,303 --> 00:02:23,654
...one to screw it in,
one to pass the bar.

2
00:02:30,312 --> 00:02:31,511
She is unbelievable.

3
00:02:31,521 --> 00:02:32,897
Here you go, Al.
Merry Christmas.

4
00:02:32,907 --> 00:02:34,231
Thanks a lot,
Mr. Ross.

5
00:02:34,241 --> 00:02:35,566
- Bert?
- Are those real?

6
00:02:35,576 --> 00:02:37,141
Thank you,
Mr. Ross.

7
00:02:37,151 --> 00:02:38,528
You're drooling 
on my future wife there, fellas.

8
00:02:38,538 --> 00:02:40,144
Why, thank you,
too, Cliff.

9
00:02:40,154 --> 00:02:42,230
You really know how to
fuck up a guy's holiday.

10
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,409
If my wife looked like that,
I'd stay home every night.

11
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:46,119
If your wife looked like that,
she'd dump you.

12
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:48,487
Is that a candy cane
in Santa's pocket?

13
00:02:48,497 --> 00:02:49,914
It was her idea,
the whole Christmas card thing.

14
00:02:49,924 --> 00:02:51,656
It's nice, isn't it?

15
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,459
Somebody get Hallmark.
I'm gonna make a fortune off this.

16
00:02:53,469 --> 00:02:55,461
Hey, Cliff,
does she have a sister?

17
00:02:55,471 --> 00:02:57,463
I think she's
an only child, Al.

18
00:02:57,473 --> 00:02:59,205
- Clifford?
- Sir?

19
00:02:59,215 --> 00:03:00,816
A little holiday
appreciation.

20
00:03:00,826 --> 00:03:02,417
Something extra.
Keep it quiet.

21
00:03:02,427 --> 00:03:04,095
Oh, sir, that's very generous,
thank you.

22
00:03:04,105 --> 00:03:05,837
Oh, they love
your '70s theme.

23
00:03:05,847 --> 00:03:07,515
Especially all those
little lava lamps.

24
00:03:07,525 --> 00:03:09,173
Oh.

25
00:03:09,183 --> 00:03:11,769
You know, Clifford,
it's inventive minds like yours

26
00:03:11,779 --> 00:03:13,970
that helped build
this company

27
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:18,192
and shape the destiny
of our great nation.

28
00:03:18,202 --> 00:03:22,071
Sir, we design
dollhouse accessories.

29
00:03:22,081 --> 00:03:25,575
Don't you ever, ever
be modest.

30
00:03:25,585 --> 00:03:27,427
Merry Christmas, son.

31
00:03:32,915 --> 00:03:34,542
Excuse me, did you
lose something?

32
00:03:34,552 --> 00:03:36,868
Hey, buddy.
I don't think so.

33
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:38,463
Oh, there she...
isn't she something?

34
00:03:38,473 --> 00:03:40,079
Oh, yeah.

35
00:03:40,089 --> 00:03:42,091
When are you gonna learn that
there's just no future in flash?

36
00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:43,542
- Future, you want future?
- Yeah.

37
00:03:43,552 --> 00:03:45,502
I'll give you future.
24 hours in the future,

38
00:03:45,512 --> 00:03:48,390
Tammy and I are going to be sitting
on the beach in a tropical paradise

39
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,953
plotting the next
50 years of our life.

40
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,632
- No, no, no.
- Now, that's future.

41
00:03:51,642 --> 00:03:53,301
You know why
that's not future?

42
00:03:53,311 --> 00:03:54,828
- Why?
- Because I'm gonna tell you why.

43
00:03:54,838 --> 00:03:57,051
Because flash doesn't
last for 50 years.

44
00:03:57,061 --> 00:03:59,101
You know what you need?
You need substance.

45
00:03:59,111 --> 00:04:01,142
You really... substance...
trust me on this.

46
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,154
I'm gonna find you substance.
I'm really good at this.

47
00:04:03,164 --> 00:04:04,697
Let's just look
for substance.

48
00:04:04,707 --> 00:04:06,814
Sue Ellen
from marketing.

49
00:04:06,824 --> 00:04:10,995
She's got great legs and a
pension and health plan.

50
00:04:11,005 --> 00:04:12,705
Okay, she's
perfect for you.

51
00:04:12,715 --> 00:04:14,406
Look,
I am involved, buddy.

52
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,391
- Just an introduction.
- I don't need an introduction.

53
00:04:16,401 --> 00:04:18,377
I found what I want.
Stop trying to fix me up, okay?

54
00:04:18,387 --> 00:04:20,254
- Okay.
- I mean it.

55
00:04:20,264 --> 00:04:21,370
Okay.

56
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:25,234
- Betty, you know Clifford?
- Mm-hmm?

57
00:04:26,886 --> 00:04:29,212
♪ Chicks go crazy... ♪

58
00:04:29,222 --> 00:04:30,781
Merry Christmas.

59
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,358
Hello? Hi, Linda?
It's Cliff.

60
00:04:32,368 --> 00:04:34,126
Oh, hi, Cliff.
How's it going?

61
00:04:34,136 --> 00:04:35,885
Great, great,
Merry Christmas.

62
00:04:35,895 --> 00:04:38,648
- Is Tammy around?
- No, I'm sorry, she's not here.

63
00:04:38,658 --> 00:04:40,191
Okay, listen,
will you tell her

64
00:04:40,201 --> 00:04:41,724
the flight leaves
at midnight?

65
00:04:41,734 --> 00:04:44,278
She knows that,
but I'll pick her up at 10:00, okay?

66
00:04:44,288 --> 00:04:46,196
Uh, Cliff,
how do you want it?

67
00:04:46,206 --> 00:04:48,011
Fast and hard?
Slow and easy?

68
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,826
Standing up?
Sitting down?

69
00:04:49,836 --> 00:04:51,567
What?

70
00:04:51,577 --> 00:04:53,955
She's gone, but there's
a note here for you, though.

71
00:04:53,965 --> 00:04:55,780
I'll read it,
"Dear Cliff,

72
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,458
sorry I can't make it.
Something came up.

73
00:04:57,468 --> 00:04:59,033
Have a good time.

74
00:04:59,043 --> 00:05:00,962
Call me when you get back.
Love, Tammy."

75
00:05:00,972 --> 00:05:04,247
Have a good...
that's it?

76
00:05:04,257 --> 00:05:06,566
I mean, there's nothing
about a relative dying,

77
00:05:06,576 --> 00:05:08,886
a mother needing a kidney transplant?
Nothing?

78
00:05:08,896 --> 00:05:10,711
What? No.

79
00:05:10,721 --> 00:05:13,558
Her mother's
as healthy as a horse.

80
00:05:13,568 --> 00:05:14,841
Thanks, Julie.

81
00:05:14,851 --> 00:05:16,759
Bye.

82
00:05:16,769 --> 00:05:18,594
Hey, buddy.
I've been looking for you.

83
00:05:18,604 --> 00:05:20,648
Hey, I have this great idea.
You'll never guess...

84
00:05:20,658 --> 00:05:22,431
this is...
it's unbelievable.

85
00:05:22,441 --> 00:05:24,151
I'm talking to Frank,
right, and it comes to me.

86
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:26,269
It's so...
it's so simple.

87
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:29,657
You know what it is?
Sheer, sheer genius.

88
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:33,442
Dollhouse landscaping.

89
00:05:33,452 --> 00:05:35,997
Dollhouse landscaping,
isn't that unbelievable?

90
00:05:36,007 --> 00:05:38,542
Look, we get teeny-weeny
weeping willows,

91
00:05:38,552 --> 00:05:40,449
we get little koi ponds.

92
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:43,379
We can even throw in some
live guppies for effect.

93
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:45,507
- What's the matter?
- Trip's off.

94
00:05:45,517 --> 00:05:48,442
Tammy cancelled.

95
00:05:50,554 --> 00:05:52,263
I'm not gonna say,
"I told you so."

96
00:05:52,273 --> 00:05:53,754
Good.

97
00:05:53,764 --> 00:05:55,850
- I told ya so.
- I don't wanna hear it, Marty.

98
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,184
You know,
it's your own fault,

99
00:05:57,194 --> 00:05:58,509
your tunnel vision.
You know that.

100
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:00,313
You know, Marty,
we're talking about spending

101
00:06:00,323 --> 00:06:01,919
the rest of our lives
with someone.

102
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:03,535
Why can't it be
the person I want?

103
00:06:03,545 --> 00:06:05,141
Why do I have
to settle for less?

104
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:07,977
Well, I'll tell you why.
Because guys like us...

105
00:06:07,987 --> 00:06:10,568
look, guys like us don't end
up with girls like that.

106
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:13,159
Why not? Is that written down somewhere?
Is that a rule?

107
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:14,483
Why not?
Tell me, why not?

108
00:06:14,493 --> 00:06:17,121
You know what you need?
You know what you need?

109
00:06:17,131 --> 00:06:18,643
You need someone
you can trust.

110
00:06:18,653 --> 00:06:20,156
You need somebody
who's dependable.

111
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,209
If I want dependable,
I'll marry a Volvo.

112
00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:24,493
That's funny.

113
00:06:24,503 --> 00:06:27,089
10 minutes ago,
I had two tickets to paradise.

114
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:29,149
Now I got nothing.

115
00:06:31,844 --> 00:06:34,112
I'm sorry.

116
00:06:34,122 --> 00:06:36,380
What the hell?

117
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,618
What do you want me to do?
You want me to hold ya?

118
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:43,022
You're scaring me, Marty.
Go home.

119
00:06:43,032 --> 00:06:45,056
Well, what
are you gonna do?

120
00:06:45,066 --> 00:06:48,653
Look, you have a wife and a
beautiful daughter waiting for you.

121
00:06:48,663 --> 00:06:51,197
It's Christmas Eve,
go on home. I'll be fine.

122
00:06:51,207 --> 00:06:54,533
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll be fine.

123
00:06:54,543 --> 00:06:56,567
All right.

124
00:06:56,577 --> 00:06:58,095
Merry Christmas.

125
00:07:00,456 --> 00:07:02,751
Ho-ho-ho.

126
00:07:02,761 --> 00:07:04,919
Merry Christmas.

127
00:07:04,929 --> 00:07:06,410
Ho-ho-ho.

128
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,006
- Hello, fat man.
- Merry Christmas.

129
00:07:09,016 --> 00:07:10,915
We're in a hurry.

130
00:07:10,925 --> 00:07:12,541
I'm sorry,
could you hold, please?

131
00:07:12,551 --> 00:07:14,085
It'll be just another minute, Mrs.
Stein.

132
00:07:14,095 --> 00:07:15,670
Excuse me, who can I see
about getting a refund

133
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,974
- on some tickets, please?
- I'm sorry, could you hold?

134
00:07:17,984 --> 00:07:19,674
I'll be right
with you.

135
00:07:19,684 --> 00:07:21,102
All right, everything's okay, Mrs.
Stein.

136
00:07:21,112 --> 00:07:22,635
Your seats
are confirmed.

137
00:07:22,645 --> 00:07:25,189
The kosher meal
is a veal chop.

138
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,349
Meat gives Walter gas.

139
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:31,102
- Okay.
- Is there someone else here I could see?

140
00:07:31,112 --> 00:07:33,406
I'm sorry, it's just me.
I'll be with you in a minute.

141
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:34,907
How about
the vegetarian plate?

142
00:07:34,917 --> 00:07:36,763
Vegetarian plate.

143
00:07:36,773 --> 00:07:38,635
But no broccoli.

144
00:07:41,497 --> 00:07:43,708
Sunray Tours.
How may I put a sunray smile on your face?

145
00:07:43,718 --> 00:07:46,002
- Broccoli gives Walter diarrhea.
- I'm sorry.

146
00:07:46,012 --> 00:07:47,702
And he likes
the window seat.

147
00:07:47,712 --> 00:07:49,547
That's nice.
If I could just get a quick credit here.

148
00:07:49,557 --> 00:07:51,173
I'm sorry,
could you hold, please?

149
00:07:51,183 --> 00:07:52,800
I'll be right with you
just as soon as

150
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,718
I've finished
with these people.

151
00:07:54,728 --> 00:07:56,637
Okay, Mrs. Stein.
You're all set.

152
00:07:56,647 --> 00:07:58,797
Okay? Great.

153
00:07:58,807 --> 00:08:01,392
These are smoking section.
Walter has emphysema.

154
00:08:01,402 --> 00:08:02,842
Jesus, Walter.

155
00:08:02,852 --> 00:08:05,553
Can you hold, please?

156
00:08:05,563 --> 00:08:08,222
I'll get you nonsmoking.

157
00:08:08,232 --> 00:08:10,500
Look, Mrs. Stein,
you and Walter have a lot to work out here.

158
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,778
If I could just get a quick
refund on these tickets, okay?

159
00:08:12,788 --> 00:08:15,406
- Thank you.
- Sure.

160
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:18,024
Um... oh, I'm sorry.

161
00:08:18,034 --> 00:08:20,828
It says these tickets are nonrefundable, Mr.
Godfrey.

162
00:08:20,838 --> 00:08:23,362
Yes, I know,
but it's an emergency.

163
00:08:23,372 --> 00:08:25,406
No, I'm sorry.
There's nothing I can do.

164
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,246
Are you telling me
I can't get my money back?

165
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,086
What's the matter,
you don't speak English?

166
00:08:29,096 --> 00:08:30,829
She said no refunds.

167
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:32,496
Just hold on a sec, lady.

168
00:08:32,506 --> 00:08:35,551
Look, when I bought these tickets,
I had a dream, okay?

169
00:08:35,561 --> 00:08:36,668
Is it a long dream?

170
00:08:36,678 --> 00:08:38,258
It was a romantic getaway
for two.

171
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,838
That's what
the ad said... two.

172
00:08:39,848 --> 00:08:42,224
Not one, two, okay?
I mean, here, look at her.

173
00:08:42,234 --> 00:08:43,716
Look at that.
Look at her.

174
00:08:43,726 --> 00:08:47,354
- She's very beautiful.
- Yeah, she dumped me, okay?

175
00:08:47,364 --> 00:08:49,138
- Smart move.
- Stuff it.

176
00:08:49,148 --> 00:08:51,020
Look, she's not going,
trip's off, she dumped me.

177
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,892
I want the money back.
It's as simple as that.

178
00:08:52,902 --> 00:08:55,712
- It's company policy...
- I want my tickets to Shreveport.

179
00:08:55,722 --> 00:08:58,532
- Here you are, Mrs. Stein.
- Look, I'm out three grand here.

180
00:08:58,542 --> 00:09:00,775
I'll give you five
for the picture.

181
00:09:00,785 --> 00:09:03,454
- What is wrong with you?
- It doesn't say about the broccoli.

182
00:09:03,464 --> 00:09:04,789
If Walter's not
eating the broccoli,

183
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:06,197
I'm not eating
these tickets.

184
00:09:06,207 --> 00:09:08,016
If everybody will just
give me a minute...

185
00:09:08,026 --> 00:09:09,825
I want a refund.
It is a medical emergency.

186
00:09:09,835 --> 00:09:12,379
A broken heart is not a medical emergency,
Mr. Godfrey.

187
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:14,163
These tickets
are to Helsinki.

188
00:09:14,173 --> 00:09:17,676
I'm warning you, lady. And you have
obviously never been in love, baby.

189
00:09:17,686 --> 00:09:20,387
My personal life is none of your business,
sweetie.

190
00:09:20,397 --> 00:09:23,099
- Maybe it's for the best.
- What? For the best?

191
00:09:23,109 --> 00:09:25,257
How can it possibly
be for the best?

192
00:09:25,267 --> 00:09:27,645
It's not my fault things didn't work
out with you and your girlfriend.

193
00:09:27,655 --> 00:09:28,500
Miss!

194
00:09:28,555 --> 00:09:29,793
Maybe it's better now
than five years from now.

195
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:31,941
Oh, is that supposed to make me feel better,
Mrs. Freud?

196
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:33,380
- Miss!
- Because it doesn't, okay?

197
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,809
I'm sorry,
I was trying to help.

198
00:09:34,819 --> 00:09:36,487
You want to help,
why don't you join the Red Cross?

199
00:09:36,497 --> 00:09:38,020
You want a refund
on your tickets?

200
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,908
- Yes, get me a refund.
- Call Santa's little helper.

201
00:09:39,918 --> 00:09:41,700
Miss,
I'm growing roots here.

202
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,359
Open that goddamn...
open that door!

203
00:09:43,369 --> 00:09:45,277
- Forget it!
- You are all the same! All you women.

204
00:09:45,287 --> 00:09:47,706
- You're all in cahoots together.
- It's Christmas Eve!

205
00:09:47,716 --> 00:09:49,145
Miss!

206
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:50,574
What?

207
00:09:50,584 --> 00:09:53,270

Hey! Oh...

225
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:27,891
Ah,
"It's a Wonderful Life."

226
00:11:27,901 --> 00:11:29,616
Janie, Tommy!

227
00:11:30,768 --> 00:11:32,051
Seen it.

228
00:11:32,061 --> 00:11:34,829
Where did you...

229
00:11:38,067 --> 00:11:39,563
Come back here,
you drunken fool!

00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,421
Thank God.

232
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:25,630
Huh?

233
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:31,428
Oh.

234
00:12:40,964 --> 00:12:42,397
Hi, Merry Christmas.

235
00:12:42,407 --> 00:12:43,869
Clifford, Marty.

236
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:45,332
Oh, hi, Marty.

237
00:12:45,342 --> 00:12:48,762
I feel terrible. My best friend in
the whole world reaches out to me

238
00:12:48,772 --> 00:12:50,389
and I was
too ignorant to see.

239
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,016
What are you talking about?

240
00:12:52,026 --> 00:12:53,632
Look, Rosemary
and I insist...

241
00:12:53,642 --> 00:12:56,729
we insist that you spend
Christmas Eve with us.

242
00:12:56,739 --> 00:12:58,772
No, I've already
got plans, buddy.

243
00:12:58,782 --> 00:13:00,816
No, we won't take no
for an answer.

244
00:13:00,826 --> 00:13:01,975
No, Marty...

245
00:13:01,985 --> 00:13:04,023
Pal, there's nothing
to be ashamed of.

246
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,071
A lot of people
are alone Christmas Eve.

247
00:13:06,081 --> 00:13:07,646
No, no, really,
I got plans.

248
00:13:07,656 --> 00:13:09,867
I'm all set up here.
I'm on my way out the door.

249
00:13:09,877 --> 00:13:12,484
You wouldn't lie
to your best friend.

250
00:13:12,494 --> 00:13:16,222
Come on, would I be alone
on Christmas Eve?

251
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:24,131
Good to be around friends
on the holidays, isn't it, Ed?

252
00:13:24,141 --> 00:13:26,206
Sure is, Cliff.

253
00:13:26,216 --> 00:13:28,969
I mean, you really follow that
ball like nobody's business.

254
00:13:28,979 --> 00:13:30,528
Mm-hmm.

255
00:13:33,599 --> 00:13:35,924
- Sam?
- Yeah?

256
00:13:35,934 --> 00:13:38,812
Can I get another one of
those Molson and shot things?

257
00:13:38,822 --> 00:13:40,773
It's called
a depth charge, Cliffy.

258
00:13:40,783 --> 00:13:43,249
- Whatever.
- It's gone.

259
00:13:45,277 --> 00:13:47,363
Eddie, why don't you
take over here, okay?

260
00:13:47,373 --> 00:13:49,422
Okay.

261
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,494
Hey, little buddy.
How about a little Christmas cheer?

262
00:13:53,504 --> 00:13:55,162
Just get Sevi
a Jameson.

263
00:13:55,172 --> 00:13:56,997
Turkey,
then, Sam.

264
00:13:57,007 --> 00:13:58,848
In a minute.

265
00:14:13,472 --> 00:14:16,090
How about some coffee?

266
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,635
I'll have another.

267
00:14:19,645 --> 00:14:22,065
Don't you think
you've had enough?

268
00:14:22,075 --> 00:14:24,191
Am I still conscious?

269
00:14:24,201 --> 00:14:26,100
Yeah.

270
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,644
Then I'll have another.

271
00:14:28,654 --> 00:14:31,339
♪ And when
it's dry and ready ♪

272
00:14:31,349 --> 00:14:33,354

00:14:33,364 --> 00:14:35,369

274
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:36,944

♪ I made you

276
00:14:38,914 --> 00:14:41,208
This girl over there.
Her name is Amanda.

277
00:14:41,218 --> 00:14:42,991
So?

278
00:14:43,001 --> 00:14:44,962
- Her boyfriend just left her.
- Just get me another drink.

279
00:14:44,972 --> 00:14:46,839
- I was dumped myself, all right?
- But, Cliff...

280
00:14:46,849 --> 00:14:49,445
Just get me another drink,
please, okay?

281
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:52,052
You don't have to be
so testy, Sparky.

282
00:14:52,062 --> 00:14:54,779
I'm sorry, Sam.

283
00:15:01,145 --> 00:15:03,554
Would you mind
if I sit with you?

284
00:15:03,564 --> 00:15:05,999
Look, I don't want to be rude,
but I really don't want...

285
00:15:08,068 --> 00:15:12,172
Oh, my God.

286
00:15:15,784 --> 00:15:18,178
By all means, please.

287
00:15:23,084 --> 00:15:24,517
Here we go.

288
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,035
Drinks.

289
00:15:27,045 --> 00:15:28,479
Thanks, Sam.

290
00:15:28,489 --> 00:15:29,939
Sure, Sparky.

291
00:15:35,637 --> 00:15:37,223
Smooth, isn't it?

292
00:15:37,233 --> 00:15:38,448
Yeah.

293
00:15:40,601 --> 00:15:43,077
- What's your name?
- Clifford.

294
00:15:43,087 --> 00:15:46,510
My friends call me Cliff.
C-cliff.

295
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,943
C-cliff, I need
to talk to somebody.

296
00:15:49,953 --> 00:15:51,227
I'm here.

297
00:15:51,237 --> 00:15:53,817
Something terrible
happened to me tonight.

298
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:56,398
- What?
- I'm sorry, I can't talk about it.

299
00:15:56,408 --> 00:15:59,119
- It's too painful.
- Okay, that's okay. You don't have to.

300
00:15:59,129 --> 00:16:00,579
Oh.

301
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:02,029
Ooh.

302
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:05,000
Yeah, I feel pain.
I feel big pain here.

303
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,283
What happened?

304
00:16:06,293 --> 00:16:08,962
Did your boyfriend
dump you or something?

305
00:16:08,972 --> 00:16:10,579
Oh.

306
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:14,150
Oh, that bastard.

307
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,711
No, his name was Max.

308
00:16:17,721 --> 00:16:20,088
We were together
for almost three years.

309
00:16:20,098 --> 00:16:23,242
We were gonna spend
Christmas together in Rio.

310
00:16:23,252 --> 00:16:26,396
Instead, I caught him
in bed with another woman.

311
00:16:26,406 --> 00:16:28,064
You're kidding?
That's awful.

312
00:16:28,074 --> 00:16:29,733
How long had that
been going on?

313
00:16:29,743 --> 00:16:31,485
11 years.
She was his wife.

314
00:16:31,495 --> 00:16:33,227
Oh, the wench.

315
00:16:33,237 --> 00:16:34,603
Gave that bitch
the weekends.

316
00:16:34,613 --> 00:16:36,314
Did she have to
have him on holidays?

317
00:16:36,324 --> 00:16:38,342
You give 'em the moon,
they want the stars, huh?

318
00:16:40,911 --> 00:16:42,011
Cliff?

319
00:16:42,021 --> 00:16:43,111
Yes?

320
00:16:43,121 --> 00:16:44,957
That's very beautiful.

321
00:16:44,967 --> 00:16:46,282
Oh, thank you.

322
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:49,560
You know, you're
an extremely poetic man.

323
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:52,993
Well, you're not
the first to say that.

324
00:16:53,003 --> 00:16:56,442
- Can I be honest with you?
- Please do.

325
00:16:57,636 --> 00:17:00,222
You have hair.

326
00:17:00,232 --> 00:17:01,964
Yeah.

327
00:17:01,974 --> 00:17:04,726
And incredibly
sexy eyes.

328
00:17:04,736 --> 00:17:06,385
Yeah, two of 'em.

329
00:17:06,395 --> 00:17:09,231
- I feel...
- What? What do you feel?

330
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:11,390
Very attracted to you.

331
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,405
- Really?
- Yeah, I feel an incredible amount

332
00:17:16,415 --> 00:17:20,300
of "elestricity"
between us.

333
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,027
I think that's
just the alcohol talking.

334
00:17:24,037 --> 00:17:26,498
Oh, I promise you,
I am not the least bit drunk.

335
00:17:26,508 --> 00:17:28,615
- Okay.
- Whoa!

336
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:31,628
You know, you're in
 no position, at this point,

337
00:17:31,638 --> 00:17:33,442
to be attracted
to another man.

338
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,257
It's too soon.
You're too fragile.

339
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:36,779
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

340
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,292
Don't you
find me attractive?

341
00:17:38,302 --> 00:17:41,054
Oh, God.
I'm sure you get catcalls from priests.

342
00:17:41,064 --> 00:17:43,118
- It's just that...
- Mm, Cliff.

343
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:45,173
There's a flame
burning inside me

344
00:17:45,183 --> 00:17:49,104
and I need your flesh
to soothe the fever.

345
00:17:49,114 --> 00:17:50,637
I could do that.

346
00:17:50,647 --> 00:17:56,153
Well, then
get me outta here now.

347
00:17:56,163 --> 00:17:57,686
Oh.

348
00:17:57,696 --> 00:17:59,272
Check, Sam.

349
00:17:59,282 --> 00:18:02,242
Come on.
Please, God, please.

350
00:18:02,252 --> 00:18:03,525
Come on.

351
00:18:03,535 --> 00:18:05,246
Come on, please.

352
00:18:05,256 --> 00:18:06,346
Yes!

353
00:18:15,172 --> 00:18:19,150
Hola.

354
00:18:22,054 --> 00:18:26,199
Hola.

355
00:18:31,688 --> 00:18:34,624
Hola, hola, hola.

356
00:18:44,368 --> 00:18:47,679
Ah.

357
00:19:02,344 --> 00:19:04,378
Mm.

358
00:19:04,388 --> 00:19:06,640
Good morning, muffin.

359
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,300
- Mm.
- Mm.

360
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,926
What? What is it?

361
00:19:10,936 --> 00:19:12,688
- Who are you? Who are you?
- What? Who am I?

362
00:19:12,698 --> 00:19:14,752
You're kidding, right?

363
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:16,807
Where the hell am I?

364
00:19:16,817 --> 00:19:19,919
And what was I doing
in bed with you?

365
00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:22,768
Oh, boy, we got
a lot to talk about.

366
00:19:22,778 --> 00:19:25,131
Wait a minute.
What are you doing?

367
00:19:25,141 --> 00:19:27,484
- Who are you calling?
- 9-1-1.

368
00:19:27,494 --> 00:19:29,162
No, that's not necessary.
Please just put the phone down.

369
00:19:29,172 --> 00:19:30,497
One more step
and I'll scream.

370
00:19:30,507 --> 00:19:31,832
- Just give me the phone.
- Back!

371
00:19:31,842 --> 00:19:33,459
Okay, I'm not moving.

372
00:19:33,469 --> 00:19:35,200
Okay?

373
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:37,504
Now, I gotta tell ya,
I'm a little disappointed

374
00:19:37,514 --> 00:19:39,371
at your reaction
this morning.

375
00:19:39,381 --> 00:19:41,883
I mean, we did do more than exchange
telephone numbers last night.

376
00:19:41,893 --> 00:19:43,041
You mean, I...

377
00:19:43,051 --> 00:19:45,110
Several majestic
times, yes.

378
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,170
Oh, this isn't happening.

379
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:50,100
- Amanda...
- Oh, God, you know my name.

380
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,810
Amanda, it is me,
Clifford.

381
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,301
It's Big Cliffy.

382
00:19:53,311 --> 00:19:56,540
The man you called
your holiday love bunny.

383
00:19:58,525 --> 00:20:00,861
- Yes.
- Oh, I get it. This is a joke.

384
00:20:00,871 --> 00:20:02,320
You're a friend
of my brother's...

385
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,770
No, it is not a joke.

386
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,398
I don't even
know your brother.

387
00:20:05,408 --> 00:20:07,117
We're not friends.
I've never met your brother.

388
00:20:07,127 --> 00:20:09,025
We met last night
at Sam's bar.

389
00:20:09,035 --> 00:20:11,288
We had a few drinks,
we fell in love,

390
00:20:11,298 --> 00:20:13,071
now here we are.

391
00:20:13,081 --> 00:20:16,116
I'm sorry,
I just can't remember.

392
00:20:16,126 --> 00:20:18,436
I must have had too much
to drink last night.

393
00:20:20,672 --> 00:20:24,134
You're telling me
you don't remember anything?

394
00:20:24,144 --> 00:20:26,377
What you're
telling me is...

395
00:20:26,387 --> 00:20:29,390
what you're telling me is you
don't remember anything...

396
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,684
anything...
that happened last night?

397
00:20:32,694 --> 00:20:36,595
- Sorry.
- I don't believe this.

398
00:20:36,605 --> 00:20:38,648
I mean, I was so good last night,
I'm screaming my own name.

399
00:20:38,658 --> 00:20:41,109
They're gonna have to change
the springs on the bed...

400
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:44,070
- Look, Biff...
- Cliff.

401
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,397
My name is Cliff.

402
00:20:46,407 --> 00:20:49,383
Whatever.
Let's just forget about last night.

403
00:20:51,536 --> 00:20:53,387
Could you
call me a taxi?

404
00:20:55,957 --> 00:20:58,867
- Amanda?
- Yeah?

405
00:20:58,877 --> 00:21:01,296
There is something
you should know.

406
00:21:01,306 --> 00:21:02,287
Yeah?

407
00:21:02,297 --> 00:21:03,872
You see, last night,
you were very...

408
00:21:03,882 --> 00:21:06,124
you were very, very upset.

409
00:21:06,134 --> 00:21:08,471
And, well, you asked me
to take you away.

410
00:21:08,481 --> 00:21:09,836
Oh.

411
00:21:09,846 --> 00:21:13,391
Honestly, you don't
need to explain.

412
00:21:13,401 --> 00:21:15,038
No, I think I do.

413
00:21:15,048 --> 00:21:16,676
Oh, I get it.

414
00:21:16,686 --> 00:21:18,621
You're worried
about what kind of guy

415
00:21:18,631 --> 00:21:20,566
I think you are
for bringing me to a...

416
00:21:20,576 --> 00:21:22,015
hold that...
a hotel.

417
00:21:22,025 --> 00:21:23,652
- No, that's not it.
- You're married?

418
00:21:23,662 --> 00:21:25,424
Well, you don't
have to worry.

419
00:21:25,434 --> 00:21:27,197
Your wife
will never find out.

420
00:21:27,207 --> 00:21:29,591
No, that's not it either.

421
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:32,969
- You see...
- Good-bye, Biff.

422
00:21:34,746 --> 00:21:37,390
I don't think 
a taxi's gonna get you home.

423
00:21:41,461 --> 00:21:42,702
Wait, wait, muffin!

424
00:21:42,712 --> 00:21:44,412
Do that again
and you lose a finger.

425
00:21:44,422 --> 00:21:46,356
Amanda, what do you have waiting
for you back in Chicago?

426
00:21:46,366 --> 00:21:48,301
American Airlines,
how may I help you?

427
00:21:48,311 --> 00:21:50,293
- Max?
- How do you know about Max?

428
00:21:50,303 --> 00:21:52,597
You keep forgetting,
we got very close last night.

429
00:21:52,607 --> 00:21:54,465
How could he
do that to me?

430
00:21:54,475 --> 00:21:56,685
I keep asking myself
the same question.

431
00:21:56,695 --> 00:21:58,385
He didn't even call.

432
00:21:58,395 --> 00:22:00,522
Amanda, you have to
forget about him.

433
00:22:00,532 --> 00:22:02,013
He's probably
in Rio by now,

434
00:22:02,023 --> 00:22:05,277
working on his suntan,
sipping on coconut teasers.

435
00:22:05,287 --> 00:22:07,612
By the pool with that
selfish wife of his.

436
00:22:07,622 --> 00:22:09,479
That son of a bitch.

437
00:22:09,489 --> 00:22:11,992
Think he's wondering about where
you're spending your Christmas?

438
00:22:12,002 --> 00:22:13,994
You think he cares?
I don't think so.

439
00:22:14,004 --> 00:22:15,443
Where was
his concern last night

440
00:22:15,453 --> 00:22:17,581
when he knew the condition
you must have been in?

441
00:22:17,591 --> 00:22:19,615
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

442
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,538
For all he cares,
I could have been

443
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:23,461
picked up at that bar
by some lowlife

444
00:22:23,471 --> 00:22:24,796
sleaze monster rapist.

445
00:22:24,806 --> 00:22:26,565
Exactly.

446
00:22:28,133 --> 00:22:31,720
Amanda, look at it
out there.

447
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:34,254
I mean, 85 degrees...

448
00:22:34,264 --> 00:22:36,464
beautiful, white,
sandy beaches.

449
00:22:36,474 --> 00:22:39,561
Palm trees swaying gently
in the breeze.

450
00:22:39,571 --> 00:22:41,386
But it's up to you.

451
00:22:41,396 --> 00:22:43,305
You can spend
your Christmas alone

452
00:22:43,315 --> 00:22:45,942
in cold, snowy,
crime-ridden Chicago...

453
00:22:45,952 --> 00:22:51,172
or in this paradise
here with me.

454
00:22:52,782 --> 00:22:54,441
I don't have
any clothes.

455
00:22:54,451 --> 00:22:56,678
Oh, I've got
a pocketful of cash.

456
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,822
Well?

457
00:23:00,832 --> 00:23:03,867
Don't rush me,
I'm thinking.

458
00:23:03,877 --> 00:23:07,021
Now you just think
about what's best for you.

459
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,302
There isn't anybody
 waiting for me back home, is there?

460
00:23:12,312 --> 00:23:15,546
Just those deep,
painful memories.

461
00:23:15,556 --> 00:23:18,600
It is terrible being alone
for the holidays.

462
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:20,592
It's the worst.

463
00:23:20,602 --> 00:23:23,980
You aren't a psycho
or anything like that?

464
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,539
I'm a registered voter.

465
00:23:28,693 --> 00:23:30,419
Okay.

466
00:23:30,429 --> 00:23:32,145
Okay?

467
00:23:32,155 --> 00:23:34,189
- Okay.
- Okay!

468
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:36,441
- Look at the fish tank!
- That's huge!

469
00:23:36,451 --> 00:23:38,870
A great, big, sunny sandbox
surrounded by water.

470
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,445
That's how
we see ourselves.

471
00:23:40,455 --> 00:23:43,583
Francine, I'd like you
to meet Clare Enfield.

472
00:23:43,593 --> 00:23:44,908
She's from Sunray Tours.

473
00:23:44,918 --> 00:23:46,628
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

474
00:23:46,638 --> 00:23:47,827
She'll be
taking photographs

475
00:23:47,837 --> 00:23:50,105
of our beautiful
Mandalay Resort.

476
00:23:50,115 --> 00:23:52,384
If there's anything
at all you need,

477
00:23:52,394 --> 00:23:53,843
Francine will
take care of you.

478
00:23:53,853 --> 00:23:55,961
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

479
00:23:55,971 --> 00:23:59,224
So I'm sure you have done millions
of these brochures before.

480
00:23:59,234 --> 00:24:00,955
This is the first one,
actually.

481
00:24:00,965 --> 00:24:02,686
Oh, I'll make it
as easy as I can.

482
00:24:02,696 --> 00:24:04,094
Thank you.

483
00:24:04,104 --> 00:24:05,522
How about if you
see the pool first?

484
00:24:05,532 --> 00:24:06,721
I know that woman.

485
00:24:06,731 --> 00:24:08,515
Come on, Cliffy.

486
00:24:08,525 --> 00:24:10,068
What do you want
to do first, honey?

487
00:24:10,078 --> 00:24:12,560
Feliz Navidad.

488
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:17,158
Oh, Cliffy, you have a way of making
me feel ever so much happier.

489
00:24:17,168 --> 00:24:19,401
Honey, when you're happy,
I'm happy.

490
00:24:19,411 --> 00:24:22,304
- I'm ecstatic.
- We'll take that one, too.

491
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:27,268
Yeah, we'll take it.

492
00:24:30,005 --> 00:24:32,215
Just what do you do
for a living?

493
00:24:32,225 --> 00:24:34,040
I'm a... a designer.

494
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,969
Architectural
consultant, actually.

495
00:24:35,979 --> 00:24:37,168
- Really?
- Yeah.

496
00:24:37,178 --> 00:24:39,587
Oh, I love guys
with creative minds.

497
00:24:39,597 --> 00:24:41,975
Is any of your stuff on display
at the Art Institute?

498
00:24:41,985 --> 00:24:43,768
Oh, you go there often?

499
00:24:43,778 --> 00:24:45,552
Actually,
I've never been.

500
00:24:45,562 --> 00:24:47,621
Oh, 'cause my stuff's
all over that place.

501
00:24:57,157 --> 00:24:59,117
You know what I think, honey?

502
00:24:59,127 --> 00:25:00,483
No.

503
00:25:00,493 --> 00:25:02,156
I think fate
brought us together.

504
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:03,820
Actually, it was
the tequila.

505
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,875
Yes, that's true.
Tequila and fate.

506
00:25:06,885 --> 00:25:08,158
To dreams.

507
00:25:08,168 --> 00:25:09,659
You wait long enough,

508
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:11,855
there's a pot of gold
at the end of every rainbow.

509
00:25:16,342 --> 00:25:18,089
I always knew
it could be like this.

510
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,836
My best friend
thought I was crazy,

511
00:25:19,846 --> 00:25:21,473
but I knew it was
just a matter of time.

512
00:25:21,483 --> 00:25:22,922
I mean, all the best
things in life

513
00:25:22,932 --> 00:25:24,642
are worth waiting for,
aren't they, honey?

514
00:25:24,652 --> 00:25:27,343
I know, it's perfect.

515
00:25:27,353 --> 00:25:31,066
I mean, flaming torches,
swaying palm trees,

516
00:25:31,076 --> 00:25:32,640
vintage wine,

517
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:34,027
and the food...
I mean, look at the food.

518
00:25:34,037 --> 00:25:36,295
There's romance
in the rice.

519
00:25:38,782 --> 00:25:40,857
At this moment...

520
00:25:40,867 --> 00:25:44,788
could you ever imagine even
wanting to be somewhere else?

521
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:47,431
I'll be right back.

522
00:25:50,752 --> 00:25:52,786
- Hello?
- Jeannie? Hi.

523
00:25:52,796 --> 00:25:56,382
- Are you in trouble?
- No, no, no, I'm good. I'm fine.

524
00:25:56,392 --> 00:25:59,000
- Did Max call?
- No, no, he hasn't.

525
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:01,638
Oh, okay, well, when he does,
will you give him a message?

526
00:26:01,648 --> 00:26:02,713
Yeah, sure.

527
00:26:02,723 --> 00:26:04,631
Tell him I'm
at a beautiful resort

528
00:26:04,641 --> 00:26:07,644
having a great time
with a fabulous-looking guy

529
00:26:07,654 --> 00:26:10,496
half his age
with a full head of hair.

530
00:26:19,364 --> 00:26:20,782
Okay, you have
to hold real still.

531
00:26:20,792 --> 00:26:22,383
I know it's heavy.

532
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:29,056
Perfect.
Thank you.

533
00:26:30,793 --> 00:26:31,991
Um, no, no, no.

534
00:26:32,001 --> 00:26:33,456
I'm sorry,
that's not...

535
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:34,912
- Oh, my God.
- It is you.

536
00:26:34,922 --> 00:26:36,793
Oh, my God.
Hey, I'll get your money back.

537
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,675
- No, no, no, you don't...
- I will, I swear!

538
00:26:38,685 --> 00:26:40,583
I do, I do understand.
I do, I do.

539
00:26:40,593 --> 00:26:42,674
A broken heart is definitely
a medical emergency.

540
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,765
- Yeah, I know it is.
- Really, no, I've been there.

541
00:26:44,775 --> 00:26:46,798
- I've had a broken heart.
- Well, I'm sorry.

542
00:26:46,808 --> 00:26:48,977
- Hey, I've had a broken heart...
- Will you just calm down for a second?

543
00:26:48,987 --> 00:26:50,228
It's definitely medical.
It's like...

544
00:26:50,238 --> 00:26:51,646
Of course
it's medical, but...

545
00:26:51,656 --> 00:26:53,418
It's like swine flu
or something.

546
00:26:53,428 --> 00:26:55,181
Will you please
just hold still?

547
00:26:55,191 --> 00:26:57,945
Thank you. Look, if it weren't for you,
I wouldn't be here.

548
00:26:57,955 --> 00:26:59,508
It's not me.
It was company policy.

549
00:26:59,518 --> 00:27:01,072
No, no, what I'm
trying to tell you

550
00:27:01,082 --> 00:27:02,856
is it all worked out.

551
00:27:02,866 --> 00:27:05,733
- You're not here alone?
- No, and I owe it all to you.

552
00:27:05,743 --> 00:27:08,037
That and the fact they don't pick
up garbage on Christmas Eve.

553
00:27:08,047 --> 00:27:10,958
Look, I owe you a drink.
Cliff Godfrey.

554
00:27:10,968 --> 00:27:12,459
Uh, Clare Enfield.

555
00:27:12,469 --> 00:27:13,976
Nice to meet you.

556
00:27:15,253 --> 00:27:16,687
Cliffy?

557
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,926
She looks
different in person.

558
00:27:21,936 --> 00:27:23,961
Oh, that's not her.

559
00:27:23,971 --> 00:27:27,672
I mean, that's her, it's
just a different her.

560
00:27:27,682 --> 00:27:31,102
Oh, well, the important thing is
you didn't eat the ticket, right?

561
00:27:31,112 --> 00:27:32,760
Right.

562
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:35,164
Is he with you, too?

563
00:27:38,902 --> 00:27:40,920
I gotta go.

564
00:27:46,618 --> 00:27:49,872
I love the way the moon
reflects off your hair.

565
00:27:49,882 --> 00:27:53,448
It's so... it's so
reflective.

566
00:27:53,458 --> 00:27:56,669
Mm, I feel like doing
something spontaneous.

567
00:27:56,679 --> 00:27:59,271
Spontaneity?
I love spontaneity.

568
00:28:00,715 --> 00:28:03,317
Especially when
it's not planned at all.

569
00:28:08,431 --> 00:28:10,423
- Ta-da.
- Oh, good.

570
00:28:10,433 --> 00:28:12,769
You wait right here.
I'll go get the suits, okay?

571
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:13,979
We don't need suits.

572
00:28:13,989 --> 00:28:15,829
We don't?

573
00:28:17,273 --> 00:28:21,043
'Course not. Damn things
take forever to dry.

574
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:25,730
Damn, I lost an earring.

575
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,358
It must have fallen off.
They were my favorites.

576
00:28:28,368 --> 00:28:31,955
Don't worry, tomorrow I'll turn this
place upside down to find it, okay?

577
00:28:31,965 --> 00:28:33,894
No, I have to go back now.

578
00:28:33,904 --> 00:28:35,823
I just couldn't
concentrate.

579
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:37,627
Okay, you wait here,
I'll go back, okay?

580
00:28:37,637 --> 00:28:39,754
No, I'll go.
It'll save time.

581
00:28:39,764 --> 00:28:40,912
No...

582
00:28:40,922 --> 00:28:42,606
When I come back...

583
00:28:44,384 --> 00:28:46,678
I don't want to
see you wearing these.

584
00:28:46,688 --> 00:28:49,697
Okay.

585
00:29:08,783 --> 00:29:11,531
I'm turning
into a prune here.

586
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:14,305
Think spontaneity,
Cliffy.

587
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,835
I would love
to go for a ride.

588
00:29:18,845 --> 00:29:20,535
What do you do?

589
00:29:20,545 --> 00:29:22,829
Oh, I'm
an entrepreneur.

590
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:25,148
A businessman,
you might say.

591
00:29:25,158 --> 00:29:27,484
- Big business?
- Big business.

592
00:29:37,645 --> 00:29:39,788
Come on, let's go.

593
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:44,543
He's naked.
Let's kick 'em in.

594
00:29:47,155 --> 00:29:50,924
Hey, mister,
what are your clothes doing in the hot tub?

595
00:29:57,915 --> 00:29:59,600
Shit.

596
00:30:10,095 --> 00:30:12,138
Hey, folks.

597
00:30:12,148 --> 00:30:13,739
Ah.

598
00:30:17,018 --> 00:30:19,344
- Cliff.
- Hello, darling.

599
00:30:19,354 --> 00:30:21,481
I found my earring.
Isn't that terrific?

600
00:30:21,491 --> 00:30:23,139
That's fantastic.

601
00:30:23,149 --> 00:30:24,817
Forgive me if I don't
jump up and down.

602
00:30:24,827 --> 00:30:26,277
Why are your clothes
all wet?

603
00:30:26,287 --> 00:30:27,727
Well, it's a long story,

604
00:30:27,737 --> 00:30:29,354
but I was
under the impression

605
00:30:29,364 --> 00:30:31,314
that you were going
to return to the Jacuzzi.

606
00:30:31,324 --> 00:30:35,037
I didn't know you were going to
stop off here and have a beverage.

607
00:30:35,047 --> 00:30:37,851
Oh, I'm sorry.
I just lost track of the time.

608
00:30:37,861 --> 00:30:40,666
Well, these things happen.
And who are we?

609
00:30:40,676 --> 00:30:42,543
Dmitri, he helped me
find my earring.

610
00:30:42,553 --> 00:30:43,868
Oh, that's wonderful.

611
00:30:43,878 --> 00:30:46,083
If we ever lose anything
again in the future,

612
00:30:46,093 --> 00:30:48,299
I'll be sure to contact you.
Let's go, honey.

613
00:30:48,309 --> 00:30:50,750
- Cliff?
- Yes?

614
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,257
Why don't you
go back up to the room

615
00:30:53,267 --> 00:30:55,804
and get out
of these wet clothes

616
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:58,341
and I'll just
finish up my drink

617
00:30:58,351 --> 00:31:01,396
and we can pick up
where we left off?

618
00:31:01,406 --> 00:31:04,014
Okay.

619
00:31:04,024 --> 00:31:06,692
Okay, you hurry, okay?

620
00:31:06,702 --> 00:31:08,752
Okay.

621
00:31:18,038 --> 00:31:23,210
Ladies, the woman...
the woman for the night.

622
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,482
Tonight.

623
00:31:25,492 --> 00:31:27,771
The lovers.

624
00:31:32,885 --> 00:31:34,001
They had the same priest,

625
00:31:34,011 --> 00:31:36,003
and he said,
"Father, we have sinned."

626
00:31:36,013 --> 00:31:37,515
He said, "Well, I can't
let you back into the church

627
00:31:37,525 --> 00:31:39,684
unless you abstain
from sex for a week."

628
00:31:39,694 --> 00:31:42,120
Blast off.

629
00:32:22,351 --> 00:32:23,993
Oh, God.
Morning, honey.

630
00:32:24,003 --> 00:32:25,636
Morning.

631
00:32:25,646 --> 00:32:26,846
What happened?

632
00:32:26,856 --> 00:32:28,456
I needed you
last night, Cliff,

633
00:32:28,466 --> 00:32:30,057
but you
looked so exhausted,

634
00:32:30,067 --> 00:32:32,069
I just couldn't
bring myself to wake you.

635
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:33,352
Great.

636
00:32:33,362 --> 00:32:34,712
So I slept in the tub.

637
00:32:34,722 --> 00:32:36,063
You were out cold.

638
00:32:36,073 --> 00:32:38,534
Honey, do me a favor.
Next time, wake me, okay?

639
00:32:38,544 --> 00:32:40,401
Okay.

640
00:32:40,411 --> 00:32:43,122
Why don't you go down to the
beach and reserve us some chairs?

641
00:32:43,132 --> 00:32:45,265
Right away, dear.

642
00:32:55,593 --> 00:32:58,054
Here, look at that.

643
00:32:58,064 --> 00:33:00,097
Look at that.

644
00:33:00,107 --> 00:33:02,131
Room with a view.

645
00:33:02,141 --> 00:33:04,269
All right,
Frank, Jr.?

646
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:05,259
What?

647
00:33:05,269 --> 00:33:07,136
If you tunnel
out of this...

648
00:33:07,146 --> 00:33:12,360
you're gonna be building sand
castles without a shovel, okay?

649
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:13,794
Okay.

650
00:33:17,657 --> 00:33:19,857
Why does it
have to be so sandy?

651
00:33:19,867 --> 00:33:22,469
I suppose you forgot
the suntan lotion.

652
00:33:24,121 --> 00:33:25,931
Look at this!

653
00:33:32,214 --> 00:33:34,382
Where are we going?

654
00:33:34,392 --> 00:33:36,317
Perfect.

655
00:33:38,594 --> 00:33:41,181
This is good.

656
00:33:41,191 --> 00:33:42,390
Thanks.

657
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,589
Ahem.

658
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:46,076
Oh, sorry.

659
00:33:47,353 --> 00:33:49,433
- Thank you.
- Gracias.

660
00:33:49,443 --> 00:33:51,792
- Thank you.
- SÃ­, seÃ±or.

661
00:33:51,802 --> 00:33:54,167
- And thank you.
- Gracias.

662
00:33:57,905 --> 00:33:59,855
- Whoa.
- Ay, ay, ay.

663
00:33:59,865 --> 00:34:04,245
- Oh, my God.
- I'm in love.

664
00:34:04,255 --> 00:34:07,973
Wow.

665
00:34:10,335 --> 00:34:12,769
My God, you are
beautiful, aren't you?

666
00:34:12,779 --> 00:34:15,214
The chairs are facing
the wrong way.

667
00:34:15,224 --> 00:34:16,998
Which way?

668
00:34:17,008 --> 00:34:20,569
- This way.
- Okay, right away.

669
00:34:23,556 --> 00:34:26,225
Excuse me? Would you mind
just scooting up a little bit?

670
00:34:26,235 --> 00:34:28,660
Thanks a lot.
Thank you.

671
00:34:31,105 --> 00:34:33,665
Okay? Perfect.

672
00:34:37,612 --> 00:34:39,238
- Ah.
- Could you put my chair down for me?

673
00:34:39,248 --> 00:34:41,323
Sure, absolutely.

674
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:43,409
That okay?
Great.

675
00:34:43,419 --> 00:34:44,984
Ah.

676
00:34:44,994 --> 00:34:46,329
Would you rub
some oil on me?

677
00:34:46,339 --> 00:34:48,247
Sure, absolutely.

678
00:34:48,257 --> 00:34:50,015
Okay.

679
00:35:07,309 --> 00:35:09,493
Thanks, honey.

680
00:35:12,271 --> 00:35:14,122
Okay.

681
00:35:17,735 --> 00:35:19,857
- Frank?
- Huh?

682
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:22,005
Frank, Jr.'s gone.

683
00:35:25,368 --> 00:35:27,328
Maybe he buried himself.

684
00:35:27,338 --> 00:35:29,497
That little rat.

685
00:35:29,507 --> 00:35:32,808
Frank!

686
00:35:35,252 --> 00:35:36,494
Hey, lady.

687
00:35:36,504 --> 00:35:39,048
Hey, you're
getting sand on me!

688
00:35:39,058 --> 00:35:40,332
So?

689
00:35:40,342 --> 00:35:41,467
- Son...
- Frank, Jr.!

690
00:35:41,477 --> 00:35:43,281
Come on.
I'm very sorry.

691
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:45,272
That's okay.
That's okay.

692
00:35:45,282 --> 00:35:47,264
- You okay, honey?
- Yeah.

693
00:35:47,274 --> 00:35:48,615
Good.

694
00:35:49,475 --> 00:35:50,758
Ah.

695
00:35:50,768 --> 00:35:53,229
I'm thirsty.

696
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:54,261
Okay.

697
00:35:54,271 --> 00:35:55,706
Whatever you like, dear.

698
00:36:02,905 --> 00:36:04,439
You stay there.

699
00:36:04,449 --> 00:36:06,826
Don't come out anymore,
you understand me?

700
00:36:06,836 --> 00:36:08,578
- Okay.
- All right?

701
00:36:08,588 --> 00:36:10,320
Oh, yeah?

702
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:12,118
And no more shovels.

703
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,932
Stay right there.

704
00:36:15,584 --> 00:36:18,228
Ugh, Frank.

705
00:36:19,964 --> 00:36:21,898
Here's the bucket.

706
00:36:27,596 --> 00:36:29,343
Psst, psst.
Hey, kid.

707
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,116
Knock yourself out.

708
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,316
- Hey, bartender.
- Be right with you, sir.

709
00:36:39,326 --> 00:36:41,152
Give me one of your
pineapple specials.

710
00:36:41,162 --> 00:36:42,394
Si­, señor.

711
00:36:42,404 --> 00:36:44,321
You really gotta try one
before you leave this place.

712
00:36:44,331 --> 00:36:46,344
- I will, thanks.
- Yeah. Hey, name's Anthony.

713
00:36:46,354 --> 00:36:48,357
- Cliff. How you doing? Nice to meet ya.
- Good.

714
00:36:48,367 --> 00:36:50,906
Listen, I couldn't help but
notice your chick on the beach.

715
00:36:50,916 --> 00:36:53,456
- Man, she's hot.
- Yeah, she's very pretty, isn't she?

716
00:36:53,466 --> 00:36:54,739
I mean, really hot.

717
00:36:54,749 --> 00:36:56,041
How'd you like to join us
for a little volleyball?

718
00:36:56,051 --> 00:36:57,324
We could use
another set of...

719
00:36:57,334 --> 00:36:59,962
Aw, thanks.
Volleyball's not really...

720
00:36:59,972 --> 00:37:02,788
uh, not, uh...
it's not my game.

721
00:37:02,798 --> 00:37:04,315
Come on, have one drink
with the guys.

722
00:37:04,325 --> 00:37:05,843
- Really, it's...
- No, I'm all set here.

723
00:37:05,853 --> 00:37:07,626
Bartender,
thanks a lot.

724
00:37:07,636 --> 00:37:09,305
What's the problem?
Would you just have one drink with us?

725
00:37:09,315 --> 00:37:11,255
No, really,
I'm all set here.

726
00:37:11,265 --> 00:37:15,186
Bartender, I'd like you
 to line up a round for my pal...

727
00:37:15,196 --> 00:37:16,953
I'm all set.
Next time, okay?

728
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:23,976
Excuse me there, fellas.

729
00:37:23,986 --> 00:37:25,603
- Oh, we were just leaving.
- Good.

730
00:37:25,613 --> 00:37:27,323
They want to take me out for a sail.
Do you wanna come?

731
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:28,689
I'm not much
of a sailor, honey.

732
00:37:28,699 --> 00:37:30,613
There's not much room
in the boat anyway.

733
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,537
Well, then everything
works out perfectly.

734
00:37:32,547 --> 00:37:33,600
Bye, Cliff.

735
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:35,237
Bye-bye.

736
00:37:35,247 --> 00:37:36,864
Bye.

737
00:37:36,874 --> 00:37:39,350
Come on, guys.

738
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,827
Last one there pushes.

739
00:37:41,837 --> 00:37:44,689

00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:28,133
How you doing?
You out there diving, huh?

756
00:38:28,143 --> 00:38:30,845
Pretty calm, no riptides?
No sharks?

757
00:38:30,855 --> 00:38:32,659
Huh? No sharks, huh?

758
00:38:32,669 --> 00:38:34,464
- No sharks.
- Good.

759
00:38:34,474 --> 00:38:36,225
Wouldn't want to have to kill
anything I wasn't gonna eat.

760
00:38:36,235 --> 00:38:38,853
Well, just watch out
for the kelp.

761
00:38:38,863 --> 00:38:40,959
- The what?
- The kelp beds.

762
00:38:40,969 --> 00:38:43,065
Oh, right.
The old killer kelp.

763
00:38:43,075 --> 00:38:45,041
Killer kelp,
I like that.

764
00:39:10,593 --> 00:39:12,720
Oh, my God.
You didn't give me mouth-to-mouth, did you?

765
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,253
No, I did, I did.

766
00:39:14,263 --> 00:39:15,890
That's all right,
Mrs. Polansky, I've got it.

767
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:20,134
- I did.
- Oh, thank God.

768
00:39:20,144 --> 00:39:22,177
Ah! Get it off me!
Get it off me!

769
00:39:22,187 --> 00:39:25,692
You're okay, you're okay.

770
00:39:25,702 --> 00:39:27,876
Are you okay?

771
00:39:37,661 --> 00:39:39,069
Here.

772
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:40,946
Oh, thank you.

773
00:39:40,956 --> 00:39:42,781
I don't know how
to ever repay you.

774
00:39:42,791 --> 00:39:46,879
Well, the brandy was $5.75.
The mouth-to-mouth was on the house.

775
00:39:46,889 --> 00:39:48,797
What were you doing
out there anyway?

776
00:39:48,807 --> 00:39:50,716
I was on a shoot.
I'm a photographer.

777
00:39:50,726 --> 00:39:52,488
I thought you were
a travel agent.

778
00:39:52,498 --> 00:39:54,146
No, I just took
the job at Sunray

779
00:39:54,156 --> 00:39:55,663
so I could shoot
their brochure.

780
00:39:55,673 --> 00:39:57,171
As soon as I
get on my feet,

781
00:39:57,181 --> 00:39:58,891
I'm gonna stop
sending people to Helsinki.

782
00:39:58,901 --> 00:40:00,633
- Drink your brandy.
- I can't.

783
00:40:00,643 --> 00:40:03,662
I'm still choking on kelp.
I close my eyes, I see kelp.

784
00:40:03,672 --> 00:40:06,691
Well, don't close your eyes.
Think about something else.

785
00:40:06,701 --> 00:40:09,099
I can't.

786
00:40:09,109 --> 00:40:10,559
Oh, my God.
There's Meryl Streep.

787
00:40:10,569 --> 00:40:12,853
- Where?
- Right there. There's Meryl Streep.

788
00:40:12,863 --> 00:40:14,990
- That's not Meryl Streep.
- I know, but it looks like her.

789
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,482
That's her nose.

790
00:40:16,492 --> 00:40:18,577
Yeah, but look at her chin.
I mean, she looks like...

791
00:40:18,587 --> 00:40:20,057
she looks like Bette Davis.

792
00:40:20,067 --> 00:40:21,528
Can't use her.
She's dead.

793
00:40:21,538 --> 00:40:23,264
What do you mean?
Why not? So what?

794
00:40:23,274 --> 00:40:25,341
So, it's my game.
I make up the rules.

795
00:40:25,351 --> 00:40:27,409
Okay, it's Meryl Streep.

796
00:40:27,419 --> 00:40:28,754
That's a quarter
you owe me.

797
00:40:28,764 --> 00:40:30,079
My life, I owe you.

798
00:40:30,089 --> 00:40:31,538
You saved me
from a kelpy death.

799
00:40:31,548 --> 00:40:33,635
Well, maybe they'll name a
drink after you at the bar.

800
00:40:33,645 --> 00:40:35,928
Yeah, the Clifford...
Kahlua and kelp, no ice.

801
00:40:35,938 --> 00:40:37,575
Nobody saw me pull you
out of the water.

802
00:40:37,585 --> 00:40:39,223
If they have, they've
already forgotten it.

803
00:40:39,233 --> 00:40:40,631
Hey, mister!

804
00:40:40,641 --> 00:40:42,867
You the one
that almost drowned?

805
00:40:44,228 --> 00:40:46,146
Yeah, but I'm fine now.
Thank you.

806
00:40:46,156 --> 00:40:48,440
You got a license?

807
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:49,390
A license?

808
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,668
To be
a kamikaze kelp pilot!

809
00:40:59,702 --> 00:41:01,136
You think that's funny?

810
00:41:03,539 --> 00:41:05,035
Look, I'm sorry
about the other day.

811
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:07,123
I was a real jerk
in your office.

812
00:41:07,133 --> 00:41:09,211
That's all right.
You got dumped.

813
00:41:09,221 --> 00:41:11,286
I've been dumped before.

814
00:41:11,296 --> 00:41:13,340
You seem to have bounced back
pretty quickly.

815
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:15,290
- Where is, uh...
- Amanda.

816
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,255
- Jesus, what time is it?
- Uh, 5:00.

817
00:41:17,265 --> 00:41:19,237
I gotta go.
She's probably worried sick.

818
00:41:25,394 --> 00:41:28,079
Thanks a lot again, okay?
All right.

819
00:41:48,667 --> 00:41:50,686
Hi, Cliff.

820
00:41:53,255 --> 00:41:55,507
- Something wrong?
- Of course not.

821
00:41:55,517 --> 00:41:57,067
Why would anything
be wrong?

822
00:41:58,635 --> 00:42:01,180
- Where have you been?
- Sailing.

823
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,672
Sailing for seven hours?

824
00:42:02,682 --> 00:42:04,808
What did you do,
circumnavigate the globe?

825
00:42:04,818 --> 00:42:06,467
What's that
supposed to mean?

826
00:42:06,477 --> 00:42:08,479
I thought we were spending
the day together, that's all.

827
00:42:08,489 --> 00:42:10,105
I didn't know you were
going off sailing

828
00:42:10,115 --> 00:42:12,692
with a bunch
of half-naked Sinbads.

829
00:42:12,702 --> 00:42:14,600
They happen
to be nice guys.

830
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:16,518
I don't care if they're
decorated war heroes,

831
00:42:16,528 --> 00:42:19,114
I brought you here so that
you and me could be together.

832
00:42:19,124 --> 00:42:21,607
What are you...

833
00:42:21,617 --> 00:42:23,426
who are you calling?

834
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:26,653
Flight reservations,
please?

835
00:42:26,663 --> 00:42:30,125
That is not necessary.
Now, will you put down the phone, please?

836
00:42:30,135 --> 00:42:31,868
Hello, seÃ±ora?

837
00:42:31,878 --> 00:42:34,379
Clifford, I don't like
possessive guys.

838
00:42:34,389 --> 00:42:35,954
It's a major turnoff.

839
00:42:35,964 --> 00:42:37,940
I think I'll just
go back to Chicago

840
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:39,642
before we end up
hating each other.

841
00:42:39,652 --> 00:42:41,335
I didn't mean
to be possessive.

842
00:42:41,345 --> 00:42:42,971
I'm sorry, okay?
I was just worried.

843
00:42:42,981 --> 00:42:44,326
That's all, honey, okay?

844
00:42:44,336 --> 00:42:45,672
I'm sorry
if I overreacted.

845
00:42:45,682 --> 00:42:47,476
Why don't you just
put the phone down, baby?

846
00:42:47,486 --> 00:42:49,895
I'm sorry, I was...
it's my fault.

847
00:42:49,905 --> 00:42:53,514
- Never mind.
- Attagirl.

848
00:42:53,524 --> 00:42:55,735
Why don't you just go in
and get a nice dress on,

849
00:42:55,745 --> 00:42:57,903
and we'll get
a light bite to eat, okay?

850
00:42:57,913 --> 00:42:59,854
- Okay.
- Good.

851
00:42:59,864 --> 00:43:01,605
But I have to
call home first.

852
00:43:01,615 --> 00:43:05,384
- Do you mind?
- No, you call home.

853
00:43:05,394 --> 00:43:09,164
What I mean is
I need a little privacy.

854
00:43:09,174 --> 00:43:10,833
I'll meet you
down at the bar.

855
00:43:10,843 --> 00:43:13,283
Okay, sure.

856
00:43:13,293 --> 00:43:16,713
Why don't I just wait for you
right out in the hallway?

857
00:43:16,723 --> 00:43:20,541
- Okay.
- Okay, bye.

858
00:43:20,551 --> 00:43:22,636
I'll just be
a little teeny minute.

859
00:43:22,646 --> 00:43:23,946
Okay.

860
00:43:32,437 --> 00:43:34,764
- Hello?
- Jeannie, hi.

861
00:43:34,774 --> 00:43:37,401
- How's it going?
- Great. Oh, it's beautiful here.

862
00:43:37,411 --> 00:43:39,174
- Max called.
- He called?

863
00:43:39,184 --> 00:43:40,937
Yeah, he was pretty upset.

864
00:43:40,947 --> 00:43:43,907
- How upset?
- Very. He never thought you'd leave.

865
00:43:43,917 --> 00:43:45,315
Great.

866
00:43:45,325 --> 00:43:47,530
Well, he shoulda
thought about that

867
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:49,762
before he took his wife
instead of me.

868
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:13,844
Get a life.

869
00:44:13,854 --> 00:44:15,304
Brats.

870
00:44:15,314 --> 00:44:17,357
- All ready.
- Great, I'm starving.

871
00:44:17,367 --> 00:44:19,276
I don't
feel like eating.

872
00:44:19,286 --> 00:44:21,211
Yeah, well,
I gotta eat.

873
00:44:22,654 --> 00:44:25,089
I wasn't hungry at all, really.

874
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,574
- No hands.
- What?

875
00:44:35,584 --> 00:44:38,712
- No hands.
- No hands? What do I do with them?

876
00:44:38,722 --> 00:44:40,130
What is this?

877
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:41,330
Oh.

878
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:43,790
Oh, it's sexual soccer.
Yeah.

879
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,818
I've heard about this.
I like this.

880
00:44:45,828 --> 00:44:47,862
Oh, my God.

881
00:44:49,849 --> 00:44:51,006
Ah-ah, no hands.

882
00:44:51,016 --> 00:44:53,560
15-minute extra penalty.

883
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:57,804
Oh, God.
Yeah?

884
00:44:57,814 --> 00:45:00,651
- Your turn.
- Oh, okay.

885
00:45:00,661 --> 00:45:03,278
Um, where...

886
00:45:03,288 --> 00:45:05,176
Mm, mm.

887
00:45:05,186 --> 00:45:07,064
Yeah, mm.

888
00:45:07,074 --> 00:45:09,576
This is nice...
this is nice material.

889
00:45:09,586 --> 00:45:11,027
Mm.

890
00:45:11,037 --> 00:45:12,930
Mm-hmm, wait...

891
00:45:15,332 --> 00:45:17,918
- Ouch.
- It's cheating, I know. I can't help it.

892
00:45:17,928 --> 00:45:19,628
It's cheating.

893
00:45:19,638 --> 00:45:22,105
Mm.

894
00:45:27,261 --> 00:45:29,086
Oh, yes.

895
00:45:29,096 --> 00:45:32,657
Oh, my living God!

896
00:45:38,897 --> 00:45:41,249
Mm.

897
00:45:56,832 --> 00:45:58,615
Clare, hey.

898
00:45:58,625 --> 00:45:59,909
Hey, you feeling
better?

899
00:45:59,919 --> 00:46:01,628
- Knock-knock.
- Who's there?

900
00:46:01,638 --> 00:46:02,995
- Kelp.
- Kelp who?

901
00:46:03,005 --> 00:46:04,454
Kelp, kelp. I'm drowning.

902
00:46:04,464 --> 00:46:06,836
- Where'd you hear it?
- From the housekeeper.

903
00:46:06,846 --> 00:46:09,219
- Where's your roommate?
- She's water-skiing.

904
00:46:09,229 --> 00:46:11,555
- So you're free?
- I guess so, yeah.

905
00:46:11,565 --> 00:46:13,015
Do you want to
help me out?

906
00:46:13,025 --> 00:46:14,881
Sure.

907
00:46:14,891 --> 00:46:17,519
Actually, do you want
to go sailing with me...

908
00:46:17,529 --> 00:46:19,344
- What?
- And smile a lot?

909
00:46:19,354 --> 00:46:22,566
The hotel promised me a model
and he didn't show up.

910
00:46:22,576 --> 00:46:24,318
I've done
this ocean, Clare.

911
00:46:24,328 --> 00:46:26,102
Look how calm it is.

912
00:46:26,112 --> 00:46:27,362
You won't even know
you're on a boat.

913
00:46:27,372 --> 00:46:29,239
I get seasick
in a water bed.

914
00:46:29,249 --> 00:46:30,522
Cliff, there's no wind.

915
00:46:30,532 --> 00:46:31,908
We'll be lucky
if we get three knots.

916
00:46:31,918 --> 00:46:33,859
- Please?
- No.

917
00:46:33,869 --> 00:46:35,971
- Please? Please?
- No.

918
00:46:37,999 --> 00:46:39,912
Looks like
the wind picked up!

919
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,999
What was your first clue?

920
00:46:42,009 --> 00:46:44,087
What are you
doing up there?

921
00:46:44,097 --> 00:46:45,746
Tsunami watch.

922
00:46:45,756 --> 00:46:48,582
I have it under control.
Really.

923
00:46:48,592 --> 00:46:50,010
Why don't you come back
here and sit down?

924
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:51,819
Okay.

925
00:46:55,557 --> 00:46:57,341
You got it, Cliff.

926
00:46:57,351 --> 00:47:00,854
You know, this isn't
my first time on a boat.

927
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:03,771
I got it, no problems here.

928
00:47:03,781 --> 00:47:06,498
No problems.

929
00:47:08,401 --> 00:47:10,101
Okay.

930
00:47:10,111 --> 00:47:11,821
You relax,
you'll have fun.

931
00:47:11,831 --> 00:47:13,230
Okay, I'm relaxing.

932
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,861
- What are you doing?
- Taking pictures.

933
00:47:14,871 --> 00:47:16,492
- Who's gonna drive the boat?
- You are.

934
00:47:16,502 --> 00:47:18,359
- Uh-uh.
- Here, give me your hand.

935
00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:21,080
- Nope, I'm not driving the boat.
- Give me your hand.

936
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:23,531
- No!
- Give me your hand!

937
00:47:23,997 --> 00:47:25,781
That's the tiller.
Hold onto the boom line.

938
00:47:25,791 --> 00:47:26,294
All right.

939
00:47:26,296 --> 00:47:27,402
That's the halyard.
You don't have to worry about that.

940
00:47:27,412 --> 00:47:28,904
- Where, where?
- Right there.

941
00:47:28,906 --> 00:47:30,540
- You see that piece of string?
- Yeah.

942
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:32,010
Just make sure it's
pointed back toward us, okay?

943
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:33,627
Okay.

944
00:47:33,637 --> 00:47:35,300
We'll take one roll
and then we'll go in.

945
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:36,973
- All right, hurry up.
- You're doing great.

946
00:47:36,983 --> 00:47:39,101
12 frames? 24? 36?
How many...

947
00:47:39,111 --> 00:47:41,010
Oh, settle down.

948
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:43,980
You have to take off
one of those life jackets.

949
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:45,790
You look like a lunatic.

950
00:47:47,068 --> 00:47:49,236
Here, here.

951
00:47:49,246 --> 00:47:51,462
Okay.

952
00:47:53,615 --> 00:47:55,201
- Cliff?
- Yeah?

953
00:47:55,211 --> 00:47:56,743
Smile.

954
00:47:56,753 --> 00:47:58,276
Yeah.

955
00:47:58,286 --> 00:47:59,945
Look, no smile,
no shore leave.

956
00:47:59,955 --> 00:48:02,457
- That's fine with me.
- Okay, I'm smiling.

957
00:48:02,467 --> 00:48:04,772
- Yep, this is fun.
- Okay.

958
00:48:04,782 --> 00:48:07,087
Tell me what
you do in Chicago.

959
00:48:07,097 --> 00:48:09,371
I design furniture.

960
00:48:09,381 --> 00:48:11,007
Contemporary or traditional?

961
00:48:11,017 --> 00:48:13,042
Um, dollhouse.

962
00:48:13,052 --> 00:48:15,679
- Seriously?
- You want jokes, you make 'em.

963
00:48:15,689 --> 00:48:17,013
No, no, no,
I'm not doing jokes.

964
00:48:17,023 --> 00:48:18,723
I mean,
that's a creative job.

965
00:48:18,733 --> 00:48:20,475
It's full-time.
I'm jealous.

966
00:48:20,485 --> 00:48:22,228
Move a little bit
to your left.

967
00:48:22,238 --> 00:48:24,104
- Okay.
- Smile.

968
00:48:24,114 --> 00:48:25,971
Wait a minute.

969
00:48:25,981 --> 00:48:28,024
How's this, eh? Eh?

970
00:48:28,034 --> 00:48:30,101
Good.

971
00:48:30,111 --> 00:48:31,435
This is great, really.

972
00:48:31,445 --> 00:48:32,962
I'm getting the hang
of this thing, huh?

973
00:48:32,972 --> 00:48:34,893
Oh, this is perfect.
This is perfect.

974
00:48:34,903 --> 00:48:36,825
- Thank you so much.
- This isn't bad.

975
00:48:36,835 --> 00:48:38,243
A little bit more
to your left.

976
00:48:38,253 --> 00:48:39,818
Now look back at me.

977
00:48:39,828 --> 00:48:41,486
Clare!
Look, look, look!

978
00:48:41,496 --> 00:48:44,224
- Okay, smile.
- Look! Will you look? Will you look?

979
00:48:46,501 --> 00:48:49,088
- Fix it!
- Oh, my God, here.

980
00:48:49,098 --> 00:48:50,438
Give it to me!

981
00:48:52,007 --> 00:48:54,124
Your string thing's
not straight.

982
00:48:54,134 --> 00:48:56,636
- Yes, I know! I know!
- Shouldn't we do that thing that sailors do

983
00:48:56,646 --> 00:48:58,044
- when they want to turn around?
- Tack?

984
00:48:58,054 --> 00:49:01,267
- I thought you took a course.
- I did, Sail By Mail.

985
00:49:01,277 --> 00:49:03,059
- You've never done this before?
- I graduated!

986
00:49:03,069 --> 00:49:04,468
What'd your manual
say to do

987
00:49:04,478 --> 00:49:06,272
when you're about to hit
the Rock of Gibraltar?

988
00:49:06,282 --> 00:49:08,263
Jump! Come on!

989
00:49:08,273 --> 00:49:11,083
What about the kelp?

990
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:30,785
- Don't worry, we weren't hurt, okay?
- We're okay.

991
00:49:30,795 --> 00:49:34,883
Hey, hey, the boat
had a faulty tiller.

992
00:49:34,893 --> 00:49:36,292
- That's right.
- Oh, sÃ­?

993
00:49:36,302 --> 00:49:38,261
Yeah, the vector thing
got all messed up

994
00:49:38,271 --> 00:49:40,003
with the tiller
thing...

995
00:49:40,013 --> 00:49:42,307
It's just very lucky I had
a lot of sailing experience

996
00:49:42,317 --> 00:49:43,600
because I was able
to minimize the damage.

997
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:45,034
That's right.

998
00:49:51,483 --> 00:49:53,099
"Halyard vector"?

999
00:49:53,109 --> 00:49:54,252
What's a faulty tiller
anyway?

1000
00:49:55,654 --> 00:49:57,380
Well, we got out of it.

1001
00:49:58,949 --> 00:50:00,909
You're very photogenic
when you're terrified.

1002
00:50:00,919 --> 00:50:03,194
Thank you.

1003
00:50:03,204 --> 00:50:05,196
How about a few more shots
while the light holds?

1004
00:50:05,206 --> 00:50:07,290
- No, you're out of your mind.
- Please? Strictly land-based.

1005
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,351
Absolutely not.

1006
00:50:10,418 --> 00:50:13,578
Do you play tennis?

1007
00:50:13,588 --> 00:50:16,107
Do I play tennis?

1008
00:50:17,342 --> 00:50:19,459
Come on, come on.

1009
00:50:19,469 --> 00:50:21,779
Give it up.
Give it to me.

1010
00:50:24,975 --> 00:50:26,534
I got it.

1011
00:50:29,479 --> 00:50:31,206
Come on.

1012
00:50:37,571 --> 00:50:39,046
Hey!

1013
00:50:43,326 --> 00:50:45,245
We surrender!

1014
00:50:45,255 --> 00:50:47,179

00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:15,726
Nice to meet you,
Frank, Jr.

1040
00:52:15,736 --> 00:52:18,297
Hey, you wanna
build a castle?

1041
00:52:18,307 --> 00:52:20,090
Yeah? Ready?

1042
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,654
Ho!

1043
00:52:21,664 --> 00:52:23,234
Oh!

1044
00:52:26,304 --> 00:52:27,988
Smash it!

1045
00:52:31,518 --> 00:52:33,285
Frank?

1046
00:52:33,295 --> 00:52:35,053
Hmm?

1047
00:52:35,063 --> 00:52:38,432
There's a grownup inside
the pen with Frank, Jr.

1048
00:52:38,442 --> 00:52:41,695
Don't worry, his teacher said
he had trouble communicating

1049
00:52:41,705 --> 00:52:43,921
with kids his own age.

1050
00:52:48,327 --> 00:52:50,486
Just you and me, kid.

1051
00:52:50,496 --> 00:52:52,914
We gotta bust out of here.
Where's that shovel?

1052
00:52:52,924 --> 00:52:54,739
You got that shovel, kid?

1053
00:52:54,749 --> 00:52:56,538
I'm tellin' ya,
we gotta get out.

1054
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:58,337
You and me, buddy.

1055
00:52:58,347 --> 00:53:00,312
Ah!

1056
00:53:06,344 --> 00:53:07,903
Build the guard tower, come on.

1057
00:53:07,913 --> 00:53:09,709
Wait a minute, cap...
wait a minute.

1058
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:11,516
No, wait a sec.
Okay, here we go.

1059
00:53:11,526 --> 00:53:13,299
Okay.

1060
00:53:13,309 --> 00:53:15,395
Okay, wait a minute.

1061
00:53:15,405 --> 00:53:17,178
Okay.

1062
00:53:17,188 --> 00:53:19,122
Oh, that one didn't
work so good.

1063
00:53:19,132 --> 00:53:21,057
Mine never work.

1064
00:53:21,067 --> 00:53:24,185
- Kick it!
- No, no, don't kick it yet!

1065
00:53:24,195 --> 00:53:26,448
All right, go ahead.
What do you think? Go ahead.

1066
00:53:26,458 --> 00:53:29,701
What do you think,
Frank, Jr.?

1067
00:53:29,711 --> 00:53:31,234
It's not perfect.

1068
00:53:31,244 --> 00:53:33,262
Not perfect?

1069
00:53:35,457 --> 00:53:36,656
Thanks.

1070
00:53:36,666 --> 00:53:38,158
Really, really,
thanks.

1071
00:53:38,168 --> 00:53:39,852
If this brochure
gets me work...

1072
00:53:39,862 --> 00:53:41,536
Telly Savalas,
Telly Savalas.

1073
00:53:41,546 --> 00:53:43,539
What are you talk...
he's got hair.

1074
00:53:43,549 --> 00:53:45,331
He's too short, he's too fat,
he's too young.

1075
00:53:45,341 --> 00:53:47,385
- But look at the nose.
- You don't get anything for that.

1076
00:53:47,395 --> 00:53:49,471
- That's not Telly Savalas.
- All right, all right.

1077
00:53:49,481 --> 00:53:51,296
- How about dinner?
- What?

1078
00:53:51,306 --> 00:53:53,511
Um, for this brochure,
I need, like, a dinner...

1079
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:55,727
- like a fancy restaurant...
- Dinner, Jesus.

1080
00:53:55,737 --> 00:53:57,061
I made reservations
on the dinner cruise

1081
00:53:57,071 --> 00:53:59,288
for me and Amanda.
I gotta go.

1082
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:44,708
Cliff, I had the best day.

1083
00:54:44,718 --> 00:54:46,736
I finally got up
on one ski.

1084
00:54:46,746 --> 00:54:48,437
Whoa.

1085
00:54:48,447 --> 00:54:51,533
But then I had a face dive
and I drank a lot of water.

1086
00:54:51,543 --> 00:54:53,525
Why are you
all dressed up?

1087
00:54:53,535 --> 00:54:55,703
We were supposed to have dinner
on the dinner cruise, remember?

1088
00:54:55,713 --> 00:54:57,914
Oh, I'm sorry.
We were having so much fun,

1089
00:54:57,924 --> 00:54:59,531
I just lost track
of the time.

1090
00:54:59,541 --> 00:55:00,917
It's dark out.
You don't need a watch.

1091
00:55:00,927 --> 00:55:03,419
I mean,
what is wrong with you?

1092
00:55:03,429 --> 00:55:05,631
Nothing's wrong with me.

1093
00:55:05,641 --> 00:55:06,830
I said I was sorry.

1094
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,399
Clifford, it was
an honest mistake.

1095
00:55:08,409 --> 00:55:09,746
Why don't you
just eat a banana

1096
00:55:09,756 --> 00:55:11,191
and mind
your own business?

1097
00:55:11,201 --> 00:55:12,627
Cliff,
that's not polite.

1098
00:55:12,637 --> 00:55:14,013
Yeah, Clifford.
Lighten up, huh?

1099
00:55:14,023 --> 00:55:15,464
Go swing
from a vine, pal.

1100
00:55:15,474 --> 00:55:19,102
Cliff, I don't like
the way you're acting.

1101
00:55:19,112 --> 00:55:21,370
Amanda, I'm not acting.

1102
00:55:34,826 --> 00:55:36,343
What?

1103
00:55:36,353 --> 00:55:37,861
Oh, hi.

1104
00:55:37,871 --> 00:55:39,514
You still need me?

1105
00:55:41,833 --> 00:55:44,033
Um... need you?

1106
00:55:44,043 --> 00:55:46,421
Yeah, you know, dinner
for the brochure thing?

1107
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:48,497
Uh... yeah.

1108
00:55:48,507 --> 00:55:49,841
Yeah, okay, where?

1109
00:55:49,851 --> 00:55:51,124
Uh...

1110
00:55:51,134 --> 00:55:53,669
The Fiesta Room?

1111
00:55:53,679 --> 00:55:55,404
The Fiesta Room?
Okay, great.

1112
00:55:55,414 --> 00:55:57,140
- What, an hour?
- Great.

1113
00:55:57,150 --> 00:55:59,033
- Okay.
- Okay.

1114
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:10,143
Oh, hi.

1115
00:56:10,153 --> 00:56:11,821
You look great.
What, you got a date later?

1116
00:56:11,831 --> 00:56:13,187
No, it's for the picture.

1117
00:56:13,197 --> 00:56:15,116
It has to be
a romantic dinner shot.

1118
00:56:15,126 --> 00:56:16,649
Oh.
Which one?

1119
00:56:16,659 --> 00:56:18,484
- Um, right there.
- Okay.

1120
00:56:18,494 --> 00:56:20,288
- You want to pour the champagne?
- Okay.

1121
00:56:20,298 --> 00:56:22,686
All right,
setting the timer.

1122
00:56:22,696 --> 00:56:25,084
Okay, we have
two minutes.

1123
00:56:25,094 --> 00:56:28,036
Uh-oh,
pressure's on.

1124
00:56:28,046 --> 00:56:30,506
Okay, how do you
want me positioned? Here?

1125
00:56:30,516 --> 00:56:32,191
Uh, there is good.

1126
00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:36,512
It's gotta be a little more romantic
than that, don't you think?

1127
00:56:36,522 --> 00:56:37,972
Should we just scooch
over a little bit?

1128
00:56:37,982 --> 00:56:39,933
- Okay.
- This kind of thing?

1129
00:56:39,943 --> 00:56:41,351
All set.

1130
00:56:41,361 --> 00:56:42,759
Great.

1131
00:56:42,769 --> 00:56:43,895
How about
my arm around you?

1132
00:56:43,905 --> 00:56:46,179
- Great.
- Okay.

1133
00:56:46,189 --> 00:56:47,935
Hold hands,
that kind of thing?

1134
00:56:47,945 --> 00:56:49,692
Wanna look there
or at each other?

1135
00:56:49,702 --> 00:56:51,402
At each other.

1136
00:56:51,412 --> 00:56:52,894
Okay.

1137
00:56:52,904 --> 00:56:54,312
Excuse me.

1138
00:56:54,322 --> 00:56:56,616
Excuse me,
are you Clifford?

1139
00:56:56,626 --> 00:56:58,024
Yeah.

1140
00:56:58,034 --> 00:56:59,702
I was asked to give
you this, seÃ±or.

1141
00:56:59,712 --> 00:57:01,470
Thank you.

1142
00:57:08,044 --> 00:57:10,078
Is something wrong?

1143
00:57:10,088 --> 00:57:12,668
No, it's just Amanda.
Where were we?

1144
00:57:12,678 --> 00:57:15,249
Um, well, you had
your arm around me.

1145
00:57:15,259 --> 00:57:18,221
I mean, I'm not gonna jump every
time she snaps her fingers, right?

1146
00:57:18,231 --> 00:57:19,712
That's probably wise.

1147
00:57:19,722 --> 00:57:22,058
I mean, a man's got to
draw a line somewhere, right?

1148
00:57:22,068 --> 00:57:24,550
Absolutely.
It makes sense.

1149
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,678
I mean, you don't,
you get taken advantage of,

1150
00:57:26,688 --> 00:57:29,023
and it's gonna take a hell of a
lot more than some goddamn note

1151
00:57:29,033 --> 00:57:30,264
to get me
to forgive her, right?

1152
00:57:30,274 --> 00:57:32,443
- Absolutely. The flash.
- Right, right.

1153
00:57:32,453 --> 00:57:34,780
- We were gazing.
- Gazing.

1154
00:57:34,790 --> 00:57:36,562
Cliff.

1155
00:57:36,572 --> 00:57:39,993
Cliff, there you are.
Didn't you get my note?

1156
00:57:40,003 --> 00:57:42,276
Yeah, I got it.

1157
00:57:42,286 --> 00:57:43,663
I feel terrible
at how thoughtless I was

1158
00:57:43,673 --> 00:57:45,196
and I'm just
really sorry.

1159
00:57:45,206 --> 00:57:48,183
Hi. I just wanted
to give you this.

1160
00:57:50,753 --> 00:57:52,187
Shake it.

1161
00:57:54,257 --> 00:57:56,400
I saw it and it
reminded me of you.

1162
00:57:57,636 --> 00:57:58,928
Well, I'll see you
back at the room.

1163
00:57:58,938 --> 00:58:01,405
Bye.

1164
00:58:10,356 --> 00:58:11,806
Look at it.

1165
00:58:11,816 --> 00:58:14,017
Is that not the most...

1166
00:58:14,027 --> 00:58:17,613
beautiful gesture
you've ever seen?

1167
00:58:17,623 --> 00:58:19,298
Can we
finish this later?

1168
00:58:36,883 --> 00:58:41,012
And three and four
and five and six.

1169
00:58:41,022 --> 00:58:43,030
You're jumping,
you're running.

1170
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:47,226
Do you have this
in a different color?

1171
00:58:47,236 --> 00:58:49,678
I'm sorry,
I don't work here.

1172
00:58:49,688 --> 00:58:53,357
Oh, right.
You're that photographer.

1173
00:58:53,367 --> 00:58:54,834
Right.

1174
00:59:12,836 --> 00:59:16,130
You know, with your face,
you should try something longer.

1175
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:18,758
Sometimes the right pair
of earrings

1176
00:59:18,768 --> 00:59:21,151
can really change
your life.

1177
00:59:24,764 --> 00:59:27,048
See?

1178
00:59:27,058 --> 00:59:29,493
Very nice.

1179
00:59:52,708 --> 00:59:54,726
Nice dress.

1180
00:59:56,712 --> 00:59:58,538
Uh, thanks.

1181
00:59:58,548 --> 01:00:00,216
Haven't seen you around
in a while.

1182
01:00:00,226 --> 01:00:01,842
Oh, Amanda and I
have been...

1183
01:00:01,852 --> 01:00:03,469
ordering a lot
of room service.

1184
01:00:03,479 --> 01:00:05,002
Oh.

1185
01:00:05,012 --> 01:00:07,515
- How's the brochure coming?
- It's coming, you know?

1186
01:00:07,525 --> 01:00:09,538
It's hard to find
reliable models, but...

1187
01:00:09,548 --> 01:00:11,551
Well, I've got to
meet Amanda right now,

1188
01:00:11,561 --> 01:00:13,855
but I could give you, like,
an hour or something later on.

1189
01:00:13,865 --> 01:00:17,499
Mm, I'm running late
for a shoot, but thanks.

1190
01:00:20,945 --> 01:00:22,645
Bye.

1191
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:25,528
Get off all the fat.

1192
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:28,427
Clap and jump
and clap and jump.

1193
01:00:36,502 --> 01:00:38,713
Honey, I want to
ask you something.

1194
01:00:38,723 --> 01:00:40,204
What?

1195
01:00:40,214 --> 01:00:42,133
I was gonna wait until
the New Year's party,

1196
01:00:42,143 --> 01:00:43,875
but tonight after,
you know, the music,

1197
01:00:43,885 --> 01:00:46,179
the lobster, and everything,
it's all too perfect.

1198
01:00:46,189 --> 01:00:48,588
What is?

1199
01:00:48,598 --> 01:00:51,726
Honey, how long
have we known each other?

1200
01:00:51,736 --> 01:00:53,342
A week?

1201
01:00:53,352 --> 01:00:55,553
Actually, it's six days,

1202
01:00:55,563 --> 01:00:57,899
but it does feel like
a lot longer, doesn't it?

1203
01:00:57,909 --> 01:00:59,933
What's your point?

1204
01:00:59,943 --> 01:01:04,770
My point... my point
is that time

1205
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:07,820
is insignificant
to people like you and me

1206
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:10,325
who are so deeply
connected to each other

1207
01:01:10,335 --> 01:01:12,853
and have this mutual trust
for one another.

1208
01:01:13,226 --> 01:01:14,897
And, naturally,

1209
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:17,543
out of that trust comes
a certain compassion.

1210
01:01:17,553 --> 01:01:21,088
And then that compassion
segues naturally

1211
01:01:21,098 --> 01:01:24,758
into a sort of firm...

1212
01:01:24,768 --> 01:01:28,419
commitment, doesn't it?

1213
01:01:28,429 --> 01:01:31,614
Cliff, if you wanna ask me
something, just ask it.

1214
01:01:31,624 --> 01:01:34,810
I love that about you,
just the way you're so direct...

1215
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:36,469
- Amanda Hughes?
- Yes?

1216
01:01:36,479 --> 01:01:39,398
Telefono for you.
You can take it at the bar.

1217
01:01:39,408 --> 01:01:41,359
I'll be right back.
Thank you.

1218
01:01:41,369 --> 01:01:43,044
Okay, I'll be
right here.

1219
01:01:48,992 --> 01:01:50,358
Hello?

1220
01:01:50,368 --> 01:01:51,869
Hey, bucklehead, it's me.

1221
01:01:51,879 --> 01:01:53,319
Max!

1222
01:01:53,329 --> 01:01:55,780
Where are you?

1223
01:01:55,790 --> 01:01:58,876
Oh, I'm so happy
you called.

1224
01:01:58,886 --> 01:02:01,066
Amanda, wait...

1225
01:02:01,076 --> 01:02:03,246
Amanda, darling...

1226
01:02:03,256 --> 01:02:07,500
That's just great.

1227
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:10,179
Just great.
Well, I wish you lots of luck

1228
01:02:10,189 --> 01:02:12,990
and I hope
you both drop dead.

1229
01:02:21,131 --> 01:02:23,441
You thirsty?

1230
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:28,109
Can you believe it?

1231
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:32,124
He goes on vacation with his wife
and falls back in love with her.

1232
01:02:32,134 --> 01:02:36,919
They're going
on a second honeymoon.

1233
01:02:36,929 --> 01:02:39,130
That no-good,
good-for-nothing,

1234
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:41,857
two-timing

Good.
Honey, I've been giving it a lot of thought.

1241
01:03:01,963 --> 01:03:03,271
I think we should
live together.

1242
01:03:03,272 --> 01:03:04,931
I'm the one who should
be celebrating.

1243
01:03:04,941 --> 01:03:06,359
I want to be with you
through good times and bad.

1244
01:03:06,369 --> 01:03:07,774
Through sickness
and in health,

1245
01:03:07,776 --> 01:03:09,919
- for better or for worse.
- I don't even know what I saw in him.

1246
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,063
I know I'm getting ahead of myself,
but if the answer is yes.

1247
01:03:12,064 --> 01:03:14,255
He's the one who lost out.

1248
01:03:14,265 --> 01:03:17,132
You could be moved
into my house by Wednesday.

1249
01:03:17,142 --> 01:03:17,607
I feel good.

1250
01:03:17,617 --> 01:03:19,436
Don't worry, I have
plenty of closet space.

1251
01:03:19,446 --> 01:03:21,042
No, I feel better than good.
I feel great.

1252
01:03:21,052 --> 01:03:23,096
I was gonna wait,
but I can't anymore.

1253
01:03:23,106 --> 01:03:25,150
He's gonna wish that...
jewels!

1254
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:26,547
What do you say?

1255
01:03:26,557 --> 01:03:27,935
I love them.

1256
01:03:27,945 --> 01:03:31,031
Say yes.
Make me the happiest man in the world.

1257
01:03:31,041 --> 01:03:32,314
Yes!

1258
01:03:32,324 --> 01:03:36,303
Play it, Ricardo.
Kiss me, you fool.

1259
01:04:20,414 --> 01:04:22,365
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha!

1260
01:04:22,375 --> 01:04:24,726
Hey, guys. Kind of day makes you
feel glad to be alive, doesn't it?

1261
01:04:32,343 --> 01:04:35,012
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like?

1262
01:04:35,022 --> 01:04:36,254
Packing.

1263
01:04:36,264 --> 01:04:37,389
I'm leaving, Cliff.

1264
01:04:37,399 --> 01:04:39,299
What? Wait...

1265
01:04:39,309 --> 01:04:41,644
did I say or do something
to get you upset?

1266
01:04:41,654 --> 01:04:43,261
'Cause if I did,
I'm not aware of it.

1267
01:04:43,271 --> 01:04:45,226
Honey, wait, just stop
packing for a second.

1268
01:04:45,236 --> 01:04:47,181
Darling...
look, if we're gonna live together,

1269
01:04:47,191 --> 01:04:49,500
you're gonna have to learn
how to communicate with me.

1270
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:51,820
- Stop following me.
- Amanda, please, just talk to me.

1271
01:04:51,830 --> 01:04:53,656
Tell me what's going on.
We'll work it out, okay?

1272
01:04:53,666 --> 01:04:56,387
- Look, I move around a lot.
- Okay.

1273
01:04:56,397 --> 01:04:59,119
It's who I am.
Don't take it personal.

1274
01:04:59,129 --> 01:05:00,704
That is not
communicating.

1275
01:05:00,714 --> 01:05:02,280
It's perfect
communication.

1276
01:05:02,290 --> 01:05:03,974
Wait, okay, obviously
something is bothering you.

1277
01:05:03,984 --> 01:05:05,668
You're upset.
We'll work it out like lovers.

1278
01:05:05,678 --> 01:05:07,002
We're in love,
remember, honey?

1279
01:05:07,012 --> 01:05:08,535
Get off of my suitcase!

1280
01:05:08,545 --> 01:05:09,787
What happened
to our plans?

1281
01:05:09,797 --> 01:05:11,413
Everything we
talked about last night?

1282
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:13,003
- Remember?
- Please, I don't want to argue.

1283
01:05:13,013 --> 01:05:14,593
This isn't arguing.
This is communicating.

1284
01:05:14,603 --> 01:05:15,719
Okay? Remember?
Wait.

1285
01:05:15,729 --> 01:05:17,878
Amanda, stop!

1286
01:05:17,888 --> 01:05:20,385
Now, before you walk out
that door forever,

1287
01:05:20,395 --> 01:05:22,893
there's something
you should think about.

1288
01:05:22,903 --> 01:05:25,260
I know why
you're doing this.

1289
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:27,856
I'm not the kind of guy you're
used to dating, I understand that.

1290
01:05:27,866 --> 01:05:29,515
And you are
scared to death

1291
01:05:29,525 --> 01:05:33,477
that you're falling
in love with me, aren't you?

1292
01:05:33,487 --> 01:05:36,907
For the first time in your life,
what you're feeling, it's real,

1293
01:05:36,917 --> 01:05:39,118
and that scares
the hell out of you.

1294
01:05:39,128 --> 01:05:41,151
But if you
walk out that door,

1295
01:05:41,161 --> 01:05:43,414
chances are that
you will never, ever

1296
01:05:43,424 --> 01:05:46,458
meet anybody like me again.

1297
01:05:46,468 --> 01:05:49,034
Now, Amanda,
darling,

1298
01:05:49,044 --> 01:05:51,797
are you willing
to take that chance?

1299
01:05:51,807 --> 01:05:53,732
Bye, Cliff.

1300
01:06:04,935 --> 01:06:07,302
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

1301
01:06:07,312 --> 01:06:10,274
You are ready for the big
New Year's party tonight?

1302
01:06:10,284 --> 01:06:12,266
No party for me, Reuben.

1303
01:06:12,276 --> 01:06:15,044
My girl did a tap dance
on my heart.

1304
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:17,813
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear about that,

1305
01:06:17,823 --> 01:06:22,578
but there's a lot of that
going around lately.

1306
01:06:22,588 --> 01:06:25,279
To love.

1307
01:06:25,289 --> 01:06:27,365
It really stinks, man.

1308
01:06:27,375 --> 01:06:30,372
Uh-oh, you getting
a head start on tonight?

1309
01:06:30,382 --> 01:06:33,380
No, I'm hoping
to choke on an ice cube.

1310
01:06:33,390 --> 01:06:35,038
I mean,
I don't get it.

1311
01:06:35,048 --> 01:06:37,124
She just packs up
her stuff and leaves.

1312
01:06:37,134 --> 01:06:40,220
One minute I'm ordering monogrammed
towels for the bathroom,

1313
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:42,406
then it's back to
a table for one.

1314
01:06:44,475 --> 01:06:45,841
It wasn't meant to be.

1315
01:06:45,851 --> 01:06:48,521
They should have those words
tattooed across my eyelids.

1316
01:06:48,531 --> 01:06:50,304
Sean Connery.

1317
01:06:50,314 --> 01:06:52,139
Right there.
Look at the hairpiece.

1318
01:06:52,149 --> 01:06:54,569
Look, I don't want to be cheered up, okay?
I wanna feel pain.

1319
01:06:54,579 --> 01:06:56,571
It helps me get my mind
off the fire sale

1320
01:06:56,581 --> 01:06:58,563
I'm gonna have to have
to pay for the trip.

1321
01:06:58,573 --> 01:07:02,452
Miss, how come you're not
getting ready for the big party?

1322
01:07:02,462 --> 01:07:04,318
Oh, I'm not real big
on New Year's Eve.

1323
01:07:04,328 --> 01:07:07,889
I'm just gonna stay in my room,
watch it on TV.

1324
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:11,461
Look, I know I should be
minding my own business,

1325
01:07:11,471 --> 01:07:14,578
but I'm a bartender,
so it is my business.

1326
01:07:14,588 --> 01:07:18,525
Your girlfriend,
she dump right on top of your head, right?

1327
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:23,556
And you, you're gonna see the
new year in on the television.

1328
01:07:23,566 --> 01:07:26,016
Come on, come on.
The two of you should get together,

1329
01:07:26,026 --> 01:07:28,435
go to the party,
have a good time.

1330
01:07:28,445 --> 01:07:31,804
It makes sense.

1331
01:07:31,814 --> 01:07:33,857
Why not?
You want to go?

1332
01:07:33,867 --> 01:07:35,682
Come on,
it's fun.

1333
01:07:35,692 --> 01:07:38,519
Mm, I'd hate to miss
that TV thing is all.

1334
01:07:38,529 --> 01:07:42,617
I'm sure I can call somebody
and have it taped for you.

1335
01:07:42,627 --> 01:07:44,493
Come on, 9:00?

1336
01:07:44,503 --> 01:07:46,360
Um, all right.

1337
01:07:46,370 --> 01:07:48,539
- Great. Thanks, Reuben.
- 9:00.

1338
01:07:48,549 --> 01:07:50,181
All right, thanks.

1339
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:57,538

01:09:52,913 --> 01:09:55,327
- I can't dance.
- I don't care if you're a good dancer.

1380
01:09:55,337 --> 01:09:57,873
I can't... no, I can't.
No, but I can't dance at all.

1381
01:09:57,883 --> 01:10:00,420
I don't want to dance.
Please don't make me, okay?

I know, I've given the flight
attendant my credit card.

1489
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:21,195
- She's checking on the first class.
- Mr. Godfrey?

1490
01:17:21,205 --> 01:17:22,487
Will you please
stop that, young man?

1491
01:17:22,497 --> 01:17:23,780
- Yes.
- There are seats available.

1492
01:17:23,790 --> 01:17:24,979
Oh, wonderful,
thank you.

1493
01:17:24,989 --> 01:17:28,451

I'll just be nearby.

1498
01:17:38,503 --> 01:17:42,081
I'll bring you back
some free stuff.

1499
01:17:42,091 --> 01:17:45,276
Remember what I said
about the Mile High Club?

1500
01:17:48,513 --> 01:17:54,102
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is American Airlines flight 861,

1501
01:17:54,112 --> 01:17:56,719
nonstop service
to Chicago.

1502
01:17:56,729 --> 01:17:59,098
If this is not
your destination,

1503
01:17:59,108 --> 01:18:01,683
now would be a good time
to leave the plane.

1504
01:18:01,693 --> 01:18:06,005
Flight attendants,
cross-check and prepare for departure.

1505
01:18:17,876 --> 01:18:21,187
Here you go. And one for you.

1506
01:18:22,464 --> 01:18:25,133
Can I get you anything?

1507
01:18:25,143 --> 01:18:27,083
Um, excuse me.

1508
01:18:27,093 --> 01:18:30,097
Do you know where the gentleman
who was sitting there is?

1509
01:18:30,107 --> 01:18:32,698
Why, yes.
He got off at the airport.

1510
01:18:35,144 --> 01:18:37,078
Just been dumped, huh?

1511
01:18:37,088 --> 01:18:39,038
Me, too.
It's a bitch.

1512
01:18:40,190 --> 01:18:42,390
You know, nursing
a broken heart

1513
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:45,069
is something I highly
recommend doing in pairs.

1514
01:18:45,079 --> 01:18:48,313
I can't believe
he left me.

1515
01:18:48,323 --> 01:18:52,827
Say, those are some very
nice earrings you have on.

1516
01:18:52,837 --> 01:18:54,402
Yeah.

1517
01:18:54,412 --> 01:18:56,738
I'm into precious gems.

1518
01:18:56,748 --> 01:19:01,295
It's what I do.
Diamonds, mostly.

1519
01:19:01,305 --> 01:19:04,688
- Diamonds?
- Yeah.

1520
01:19:06,508 --> 01:19:08,275
Excuse me.

1521
01:19:08,285 --> 01:19:10,053
Certainly.

1522
01:19:10,063 --> 01:19:11,320
Ahem.

1523
01:19:13,723 --> 01:19:16,434
You know, my friends
call me Scooter.

1524
01:19:16,444 --> 01:19:19,093
- Scooter?
- Yeah.

1525
01:19:19,103 --> 01:19:21,315
It's a funny story
how I got the name.

1526
01:19:21,325 --> 01:19:23,264
I used to have one.

1527
01:19:23,274 --> 01:19:25,058
Tell me about
the diamonds again.

1528
01:19:25,068 --> 01:19:27,753
Well, you know,
they come in many shapes.

1529
01:19:33,326 --> 01:19:35,010
Clare?

1530
01:19:36,955 --> 01:19:38,363
Clare?

1531
01:19:38,373 --> 01:19:40,474
Clare, I know
you're in there.

1532
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:42,601
Please... please
open the door.

1533
01:19:44,862 --> 01:19:46,205
Look, what can I say?

1534
01:19:46,215 --> 01:19:50,276
I'm sorry about last night.
Because I am.

1535
01:19:50,286 --> 01:19:54,348
I have no excuses.
I deserve whatever I get.

1536
01:19:54,358 --> 01:19:55,932
Amanda and I,
we split up.

1537
01:19:55,942 --> 01:19:57,934
I know you've
heard it before,

1538
01:19:57,944 --> 01:19:59,926
but this time
I left her for good.

1539
01:19:59,936 --> 01:20:01,854
I mean, she's on a plane
back to Chicago now.

1540
01:20:01,864 --> 01:20:05,056
I had to come back.
Clare...

1541
01:20:05,066 --> 01:20:08,560
I just wanted a chance.
Please, I...

1542
01:20:08,570 --> 01:20:11,197
I want us to be together.
Just try, please.

1543
01:20:11,207 --> 01:20:13,341
Open the door, please.

1544
01:20:23,210 --> 01:20:24,669
The woman who stays
in the room, where is she?

1545
01:20:24,679 --> 01:20:26,687
She checked out.

1546
01:20:32,135 --> 01:20:33,777
Are you okay?

1547
01:20:33,787 --> 01:20:35,420
Yeah, thanks.

1548
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:38,089

I'll just check
on those accommodations.

1559
01:21:25,990 --> 01:21:27,847
Excuse me,
is Clare working today?

1560
01:21:27,857 --> 01:21:29,776
I'm sorry, she's not
working here anymore.

1561
01:21:29,786 --> 01:21:32,060
- What?
- Let me get you a brochure.

1562
01:21:32,070 --> 01:21:34,447
I see, well, is there any way that
I could get in touch with her?

1563
01:21:34,457 --> 01:21:37,398
- I wouldn't know.
- Just a telephone number, an address,

1564
01:21:37,408 --> 01:21:40,078
anything like that would be a great help,
if you could, please.

1565
01:21:40,088 --> 01:21:42,236
We don't have that kind
of information here.

1566
01:21:42,246 --> 01:21:44,697
- I see.
- And even if I did, I couldn't give it to you.

1567
01:21:44,707 --> 01:21:47,168
Yes, I understand, but I tried...
she's not listed in the phone book.

1568
01:21:47,178 --> 01:21:49,369
Any help that
you could give me,

1569
01:21:49,379 --> 01:21:50,922
- I would really appreciate it, please?
- Look, I'm sorry, I can't-

1570
01:21:50,932 --> 01:21:52,622
I need to
get in touch with her.

1571
01:21:52,632 --> 01:21:54,342
I'm sorry to be rude, but please,
can you please help me?

1572
01:21:54,352 --> 01:21:56,470
There's really
nothing I can do.

1573
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,472
Let me check those flights.

1574
01:21:58,482 --> 01:21:59,379
Here's my card.

1575
01:21:59,389 --> 01:22:02,725
If anything changes,
Cliff Godfrey, okay?

1576
01:22:02,735 --> 01:22:04,550
Hey, buddy.
Welcome home.

1577
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,928
Sorry I didn't get right
back to you last night,

1578
01:22:06,938 --> 01:22:09,722
- but we had the tradition of taking down the tree...
- It's all right.

1579
01:22:09,732 --> 01:22:12,068
- It's all right, Marty.
- ...and if Rhonda doesn't break at least one ornament,

1580
01:22:12,078 --> 01:22:14,253
- she's not happy.
- Marty!

1581
01:22:15,446 --> 01:22:16,979
Sorry.

1582
01:22:16,989 --> 01:22:18,282
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

1583
01:22:18,292 --> 01:22:21,025
Doesn't matter.

1584
01:22:21,035 --> 01:22:23,162
All my life, I'm waiting
for the right girl to come along

1585
01:22:23,172 --> 01:22:25,457
and when she finally does,
I don't even notice her.

1586
01:22:25,467 --> 01:22:28,626
Then I notice her
and I screw her over.

1587
01:22:28,636 --> 01:22:31,812
For what?
A walking magazine cover.

1588
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,924
I'm a complete loser,
Marty.

1589
01:22:34,934 --> 01:22:36,333
Well, you...

1590
01:22:36,343 --> 01:22:39,362
you'll get no argument
from me there.

1591
01:22:42,348 --> 01:22:43,840
So what?

1592
01:22:43,850 --> 01:22:46,008
So what?
Maybe...

1593
01:22:46,018 --> 01:22:47,719
maybe you do, you know,
do this thing.

1594
01:22:47,729 --> 01:22:50,106
You're this guy.
You get to date the magazine covers.

1595
01:22:50,116 --> 01:22:51,649
You do it for 20 or 30 years,
so what?

1596
01:22:51,659 --> 01:22:54,100
I mean,
that's a great thing.

1597
01:22:54,110 --> 01:22:55,653
You know, you date them
and then you get old

1598
01:22:55,663 --> 01:22:58,406
and then you... don't.

1599
01:22:58,416 --> 01:23:01,149
So what?

1600
01:23:01,159 --> 01:23:03,151
What am I gonna do,
buddy?

1601
01:23:03,161 --> 01:23:05,372
Mr. Godfrey, call on line two.

1602
01:23:05,382 --> 01:23:06,404
It's Lisa.

1603
01:23:06,414 --> 01:23:08,207
Would you take a message, please, Maria?
Thank you.

1604
01:23:08,217 --> 01:23:09,824
Lisa?
Now who's Lisa?

1605
01:23:09,834 --> 01:23:11,919
Mr. Godfrey, the woman
says it's important.

1606
01:23:11,929 --> 01:23:15,214
She's calling
from Sunray Tours.

1607
01:23:15,224 --> 01:23:16,441
Hello?

1608
01:23:19,594 --> 01:23:22,138
How come you
didn't have to dress up?

1609
01:23:22,148 --> 01:23:23,337
Yeah?

1610
01:23:23,347 --> 01:23:25,256
All right,
turn around.

1611
01:23:25,266 --> 01:23:28,478
You all look great.
You come over here and switch places.

1612
01:23:28,488 --> 01:23:29,927
That's better.

1613
01:23:29,937 --> 01:23:31,872
Are you hot
in that thing?

1614
01:23:33,274 --> 01:23:35,375
All right,
you look really good.

1615
01:23:36,986 --> 01:23:39,145
You just need one thing.

1616
01:23:39,155 --> 01:23:40,881
Good morning, Target shoppers.

1617
01:23:40,891 --> 01:23:42,617
Don't forget,
for the next 15 minutes,

1618
01:23:42,627 --> 01:23:44,066
there's
a bull's-eye special...

1619
01:23:44,076 --> 01:23:45,745
Come on, lady.
I got football practice.

1620
01:23:45,755 --> 01:23:47,528
Me, too.

1621
01:23:47,538 --> 01:23:51,543
Hey, Larry, come on.
Stop moving there, will ya?

1622
01:23:51,553 --> 01:23:52,418
Dad.

1623
01:23:52,428 --> 01:23:54,411
Whoa.

1624
01:23:54,421 --> 01:23:56,423
Mom, Larry
gave me a wedgie.

1625
01:23:56,433 --> 01:23:57,538
I did not.

1626
01:23:57,548 --> 01:23:58,966
All right, you guys.
Knock it off.

1627
01:23:58,976 --> 01:24:00,417
I mean it this time.

1628
01:24:00,427 --> 01:24:02,903
Nobody moves a muscle,
you got that?

1629
01:24:02,913 --> 01:24:05,389
Shut up, you little
rug rats, and smile.

1630
01:24:05,399 --> 01:24:07,574
Or else no TV.

1631
01:24:09,352 --> 01:24:10,978
Good morning, Target shoppers.

1632
01:24:10,988 --> 01:24:12,625
Don't forget,
our after Christmas sale

1633
01:24:12,635 --> 01:24:14,263
will be extended
throughout February,

1634
01:24:14,273 --> 01:24:16,400
and please disregard
the rest of this announcement

1635
01:24:16,410 --> 01:24:18,069
as it does not
pertain to you.

1636
01:24:18,079 --> 01:24:21,438
Clare, it's me, Cliff.

1637
01:24:21,448 --> 01:24:23,241
Look, I know you don't want
to hear anything I have to say,

1638
01:24:23,251 --> 01:24:25,733
but I'm gonna
say it anyway.

1639
01:24:25,743 --> 01:24:27,636
I don't know
how to apologize enough

1640
01:24:27,646 --> 01:24:31,173
for what happened
the other night.

1641
01:24:31,183 --> 01:24:34,710
I have no excuses.
I am an idiot, I...

1642
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:36,577
attention,
Target shoppers,

1643
01:24:36,587 --> 01:24:40,842
there is a bull's-eye
special sale on tube socks

1644
01:24:40,852 --> 01:24:42,459
in aisle three.

1645
01:24:42,469 --> 01:24:45,555
Um, Clare, I just didn't
know what I wanted...

1646
01:24:45,565 --> 01:24:48,381
Hey! Hey! You!

1647
01:24:48,391 --> 01:24:52,019
I didn't know
what I wanted, but now I do,

1648
01:24:52,029 --> 01:24:55,189
and it's... it's you.
It's only you.

1649
01:24:55,199 --> 01:24:57,181
You've gotta believe me.

1650
01:24:57,191 --> 01:25:00,519
- That is so beautiful.
- It's stupid.

1651
01:25:00,529 --> 01:25:02,989
Clare, I could spend all day
apologizing on this ridiculous thing...

1652
01:25:02,999 --> 01:25:04,481
Hey, wise guy!

1653
01:25:04,491 --> 01:25:07,358
I'm sorry, I am,
but I am being chased around

1654
01:25:07,368 --> 01:25:08,927
by this angry security guard
and I just want you to know...

1655
01:25:10,413 --> 01:25:15,241
Hey!

1656
01:25:15,251 --> 01:25:17,587
Why don't you ever
talk to me like that?

1657
01:25:17,597 --> 01:25:19,897
I don't have
a loudspeaker.

1658
01:25:21,382 --> 01:25:23,025
Clare!

1659
01:25:25,386 --> 01:25:27,555
- Good luck, Clare!
- Cliff?

1660
01:25:27,565 --> 01:25:28,806
Clare?

1661
01:25:28,816 --> 01:25:30,631
Cliff?

1662
01:25:30,641 --> 01:25:32,509
But I want Clare!
Clare!

1663
01:25:32,519 --> 01:25:34,302
I don't know why.
I mean... Clare!

1664
01:25:34,312 --> 01:25:36,314
Okay, I know him.
He's a friend of mine.

1665
01:25:36,324 --> 01:25:37,346
That's right.

1666
01:25:37,356 --> 01:25:38,581
You actually
know this guy?

1667
01:25:38,591 --> 01:25:39,817
- Yes, yes.
- Yeah, pal.

1668
01:25:39,827 --> 01:25:41,058
I'll do this, okay?

1669
01:25:41,068 --> 01:25:42,562
He broke
the manager's microphone.

1670
01:25:42,572 --> 01:25:43,438
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1671
01:25:43,448 --> 01:25:45,823
I'll take full responsibility
for it, really.

1672
01:25:45,833 --> 01:25:47,575
- I'm sorry.
- All right, all right.

1673
01:25:47,585 --> 01:25:48,910
Just don't let it
happen again.

1674
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:50,651
- He won't.
- All right.

1675
01:25:50,661 --> 01:25:54,666
Look, Clare, I've got
to tell you something.

1676
01:25:54,676 --> 01:25:56,642
I don't want to hear it.

1677
01:25:59,588 --> 01:26:00,959
Clare!

1678
01:26:00,969 --> 01:26:02,330
I just...

1679
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:05,275
I just need to you to know
that I love you.

1680
01:26:05,285 --> 01:26:08,220
Uh, testing, one, two.

1681
01:26:08,230 --> 01:26:09,931
I'm sorry,
did you say something?

1682
01:26:09,941 --> 01:26:12,089
I said I love you!

1683
01:26:12,099 --> 01:26:13,726
Should I turn it off?

1684
01:26:13,736 --> 01:26:15,594
No.

1685
01:26:15,604 --> 01:26:17,980
Sorry, I just couldn't hear you.
There's all this noise.

1686
01:26:17,990 --> 01:26:19,347
I said I love you!

1687
01:26:19,357 --> 01:26:22,736
Testing. Hello?

1688
01:26:22,746 --> 01:26:24,310
