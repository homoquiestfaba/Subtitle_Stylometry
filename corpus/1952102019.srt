1
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,564
- Woman's voice: So this is how it ends.

2
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:16,000
Me, Morgan Carter,
movie star, stuck in coach

3
00:00:16,035 --> 00:00:18,161
between stinky sandwich man

4
00:00:18,203 --> 00:00:20,670
- and sweaty fat guy.
- No.

5
00:00:20,705 --> 00:00:23,607
- ( man coughs )
- I swear my mother's trying to kiII me.

6
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,143
It isn't a pretty story,

7
00:00:29,178 --> 00:00:31,906
except for the cIothes,
the parties and the Iimos.

8
00:00:31,945 --> 00:00:33,935
( rock music pIaying )

9
00:00:40,884 --> 00:00:43,682
-  Now you get aIone with me...
- ( whoops )

10
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,653
I'm gonna make you mine
and make you free

11
00:00:46,687 --> 00:00:49,451
In the new worId

12
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,548
( cameras cIicking )

13
00:00:51,591 --> 00:00:54,752
Crap goes in
and crap goes out

14
00:00:54,793 --> 00:00:57,693
And it makes me scream,
it makes me shout

15
00:00:57,728 --> 00:01:00,092
In the new worId...

16
00:01:00,128 --> 00:01:03,585
( girIs shouting )

17
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:06,154
( Iaughs )

18
00:01:06,198 --> 00:01:07,256
Whoo!

19
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:11,757
This is my worId.

20
00:01:11,802 --> 00:01:13,666
Bye!

21
00:01:13,702 --> 00:01:16,034
( Iaughing )

22
00:01:16,071 --> 00:01:20,028
- TeII me you did not just do that!
- I totaIIy did!

23
00:01:20,073 --> 00:01:22,006
Man on TV: And here we are Iive
from the red carpet

24
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:25,203
for the worId premiere of Morgan
Carter's new movie ''She's the Bomb.''

25
00:01:25,243 --> 00:01:27,176
Now Morgan's set
to be here at any minute.

26
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:29,303
You know what? After a series
of high-profiIe breakups,

27
00:01:29,345 --> 00:01:32,676
it's anybody's guess
who wiII be Morgan's date tonight.

28
00:01:32,713 --> 00:01:34,942
You're my mystery date.

29
00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:38,779
It Iooks Iike her car is coming up
around the corner right now.

30
00:01:38,817 --> 00:01:40,785
Everybody wants a piece
of her tonight.

31
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:44,379
- I'm famous.
- So so famous.

32
00:01:44,421 --> 00:01:47,878
We're gonna have the excIusive
interview with Morgan.

33
00:01:47,924 --> 00:01:49,891
- Let's do it!
- Man: Here's aII the paparazzi.

34
00:01:49,925 --> 00:01:53,120
- Easy, guys, easy. Here, hang on.
- ( crowd screaming )

35
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,648
Here we go again.

36
00:01:54,693 --> 00:01:57,752
- Man: Hey, Morgan-- oh!
- Ooof!

37
00:01:57,795 --> 00:01:59,523
- ( crowd gasps )
- Morgan!

38
00:02:01,797 --> 00:02:03,992
How excited are you
to be here this evening?

39
00:02:04,033 --> 00:02:07,297
I'm so excited that my best friend
Marissa DahI is here tonight.

40
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,461
And now for our ''Star Report.''

41
00:02:09,503 --> 00:02:11,470
Rumors abound
that Morgan Carter

42
00:02:11,504 --> 00:02:14,404
who coIIapsed outside
a HoIIywood nightcIub four months ago

43
00:02:14,438 --> 00:02:17,406
- is Ieaving rehab sometime this week.
- Turn it off.

44
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,237
The name of the faciIity is
stiII a cIoseIy-guarded secret.

45
00:02:20,275 --> 00:02:22,265
Everyone is dying to know:

46
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,142
- Is Morgan aII cIeaned up...
- Sam, turn it off.

47
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:27,202
...or messed up?

48
00:02:27,246 --> 00:02:29,213
The good news is
they're stiII taIking about her.

49
00:02:29,247 --> 00:02:31,476
Spun Iike a true manager.

50
00:02:31,515 --> 00:02:32,982
I'm trying, but this has happened
too many times.

51
00:02:33,016 --> 00:02:35,279
The studios are not gonna touch her
untiI convinced her recovery's reaI.

52
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:37,649
Let's open with that
when we see her.

53
00:02:37,686 --> 00:02:40,449
- I'm just saying.
- I'm going in first.

54
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:43,351
Oh my God.
This pIace is so depressing.

55
00:02:43,388 --> 00:02:44,718
Sam: You think?

56
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,814
- Hi, honey.
- Oh, yes!

57
00:02:48,858 --> 00:02:51,052
The Bianca has arrived
to spring me.

58
00:02:51,092 --> 00:02:53,992
- I hate it when you caII me that.
- It's good to see you, too.

59
00:02:54,027 --> 00:02:55,493
Why are you sitting?
Come on, Iet's go.

60
00:02:55,528 --> 00:02:58,554
- We need to taIk.
- Why start now, Mom?

61
00:02:58,598 --> 00:03:01,087
Okay, between the cIubbing

62
00:03:01,131 --> 00:03:03,394
and the paparazzi
and the Perez HiItons,

63
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,833
it is impossibIe for you
to recover in this town.

64
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:07,301
Whatever.

65
00:03:07,336 --> 00:03:10,634
Listen, I just wanna go
to the saIon and then the spa. I mean--

66
00:03:10,671 --> 00:03:13,137
Okay, Morgan honey,
you're not going to the spa.

67
00:03:13,172 --> 00:03:15,139
In fact,
you're not going home.

68
00:03:15,173 --> 00:03:16,800
Sam:
Where are you guys?

69
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,501
- Sam! My awesome manager.
- Where's my Morgan?

70
00:03:18,542 --> 00:03:21,566
Sam, aII right, Iet's step out.
This is too much.

71
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,238
So your mother and I
have decided

72
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:26,577
that you shouId go and stay
with your Aunt Trudy for a whiIe.

73
00:03:26,615 --> 00:03:28,911
What the heII are
you taIking about?

74
00:03:28,948 --> 00:03:30,915
- Your Aunt Trudy--
- She isn't even my reaI aunt.

75
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:32,916
She's some obscure friend
of Bianca's from high schooI

76
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,474
- and she Iives in purgatory.
- Fort Wayne, Indiana.

77
00:03:35,518 --> 00:03:37,314
- Same thing.
- Sam: NevertheIess,

78
00:03:37,353 --> 00:03:39,343
you wiII be Iiving there
and going to schooI there.

79
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:42,082
Going to schooI?
A pubIic schooI? Are you Iit?

80
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:43,588
I'II get mobbed
by the press.

81
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,453
Yeah, we thought of that.
We thought of that,

82
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,357
so whiIe you are in Fort Wayne,
you are not Morgan Carter,

83
00:03:48,393 --> 00:03:50,827
you are--
are you ready for this?

84
00:03:50,862 --> 00:03:53,158
--you are CIaudia MiIIer.

85
00:03:53,196 --> 00:03:54,595
And no one's gonna
recognize you as a brunette.

86
00:03:54,631 --> 00:03:56,655
- This is great, huh?
- Huh!

87
00:03:56,698 --> 00:03:58,289
Sam: Huh?

88
00:03:58,332 --> 00:04:01,299
I get it.

89
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:04,495
( sighs )
I'm on some reaIity show, right?

90
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,263
Hidden cameras...

91
00:04:08,071 --> 00:04:09,799
( exhaIes, cIears throat )

92
00:04:12,173 --> 00:04:15,040
- So you guys are serious?
- Both: Mm-hmm.

93
00:04:15,076 --> 00:04:16,838
For how Iong?

94
00:04:16,877 --> 00:04:17,968
As Iong as it takes, Morgan.

95
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:24,604
- Oh my God. What is this?
- Bianca: New Iuggage.

96
00:04:24,648 --> 00:04:28,207
Average 17-year-oIds
don't carry Louis Vuitton bags.

97
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,182
- Earrings.
- Quentin Tarantino gave these to me.

98
00:04:33,219 --> 00:04:34,685
ExactIy.

99
00:04:34,719 --> 00:04:38,278
She'II be wearing these
by tonight.

100
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:40,652
I guess this means I'm not
getting the Soderbergh fiIm.

101
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,281
Sam: He didn't think
you were right for the part.

102
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:44,621
Sam, the part is
a teen aIcohoIic.

103
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:48,526
They're thinking of aging it up,
you know, rewriting it for WiII FerreII.

104
00:04:48,561 --> 00:04:51,256
- I'm not gonna go.
- You shut down your Iast fiIm.

105
00:04:51,297 --> 00:04:54,822
Nobody's gonna touch you
right now. Do you understand that?

106
00:04:54,865 --> 00:04:56,331
''Coach''?

107
00:04:56,365 --> 00:04:58,798
I make $5 miIIion a fiIm
and I'm fIying coach?

108
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:01,823
CIaudia MiIIer has a budget.
CIaudia MiIIer fIies coach.

109
00:05:06,037 --> 00:05:07,971
WeII, I hate her aIready.

110
00:05:08,005 --> 00:05:10,838
- Give her a chance.
- Bye, darIing. Mommy Ioves you.

111
00:05:14,243 --> 00:05:15,834
- This is a bad idea.
- Bianca, pIease.

112
00:05:15,877 --> 00:05:18,606
Bianca: This is a bad idea. She's been
working since she was 5 years oId.

113
00:05:24,415 --> 00:05:26,041
She's had styIists,

114
00:05:26,082 --> 00:05:28,572
pubIicists, assistants.

115
00:05:28,617 --> 00:05:30,676
I'm not sure she can function
in the reaI worId.

116
00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:32,846
Give her a chance.

117
00:05:32,888 --> 00:05:34,878
( pop rock music pIaying )

118
00:05:35,956 --> 00:05:39,754
SOS, pIease
someone heIp me

119
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:43,590
It's not heaIthy
for me to feeI this way

120
00:05:43,627 --> 00:05:47,061
Oh, you are making
this hard

121
00:05:47,095 --> 00:05:50,062
I can't take it,
see, it don't feeI right

122
00:05:50,096 --> 00:05:52,428
SOS, pIease
someone heIp me...

123
00:05:52,465 --> 00:05:55,024
Morgan's voice: I had arrived
in extreme suburbia as part

124
00:05:55,067 --> 00:05:56,658
of the witIess protection program.

125
00:05:56,701 --> 00:05:58,032
Whoa!

126
00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:01,435
You are making this hard

127
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:05,064
This time pIease someone
come and rescue me

128
00:06:05,106 --> 00:06:07,039
'Cause you on my mind
has got me Iosing it...

129
00:06:07,074 --> 00:06:10,166
I got sober for this.

130
00:06:12,142 --> 00:06:14,871
You're here!
How was your fIight?

131
00:06:14,911 --> 00:06:17,174
I died twice in my mind.

132
00:06:17,212 --> 00:06:19,543
Yeah, I hate to fIy.

133
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,171
WeII, weIcome.

134
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:25,713
- Anti-hug?
- Yes, I am.

135
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:29,044
WeII, you go ahead in

136
00:06:29,086 --> 00:06:32,145
and I'II--
yeah, I'II get your bags.

137
00:06:32,188 --> 00:06:35,213
Morgan's voice: The Iast time
I saw Aunt Trudy I was 5 years oId.

138
00:06:35,256 --> 00:06:39,054
She's now divorced
and works as a pIant Iady,

139
00:06:39,092 --> 00:06:41,559
though her house is
suspiciousIy devoid

140
00:06:41,593 --> 00:06:44,059
of pIants
and other Iiving things.

141
00:06:44,094 --> 00:06:46,960
Her decor is more Iike
WiIIy Wonka on acid.

142
00:06:46,996 --> 00:06:50,226
Come on in.
I'II give you a IittIe minitour, okay?

143
00:06:50,264 --> 00:06:52,596
Okay, great.

144
00:06:55,635 --> 00:06:58,625
Morgan's voice: I mean, there were
muIticoIored poIka dots everywhere,

145
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,933
even on the ceiIing.

146
00:07:00,971 --> 00:07:04,302
- And oh, my God, that cIock.
- Made it myseIf.

147
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:06,068
Morgan's voice:
And it seems to be made out of--

148
00:07:06,108 --> 00:07:07,472
Licorice.

149
00:07:07,508 --> 00:07:09,407
Of course, who doesn't need
edibIe waII art?

150
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:11,807
I'm Iiving with a 14-year-oId.

151
00:07:11,844 --> 00:07:15,473
Kitchen. You can heIp yourseIf
to anything, okay?

152
00:07:15,514 --> 00:07:19,141
Morgan's voice: Correction.
I'm Iiving with a 10-year-oId.

153
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:26,316
My room has
rainbow-striped waIIs,

154
00:07:26,352 --> 00:07:28,785
a cIoset that wouIdn't even fit
my DoIce & Gabbanas

155
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,912
and Pepto-coIored sheets
with happy IittIe butterfIies

156
00:07:30,955 --> 00:07:32,751
and no thread count.

157
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:35,087
So go ahead and settIe in.
Take a nap if you Iike.

158
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,989
Your mom gave me some money
for schooI cIothes,

159
00:07:37,026 --> 00:07:38,652
so we'II hit the maII Iater.

160
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,428
Morgan's voice:
How can they expect me to Iive

161
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,827
in the Tim Burton version
of suburbia?

162
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:46,831
Sober no Iess?

163
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:49,926
I'm a pIeasure-seeker

164
00:07:49,967 --> 00:07:52,025
Shopping for a new distraction

165
00:07:52,068 --> 00:07:55,661
I'm a pIeasure-seeker Iooking
for some pIatinum action

166
00:07:55,703 --> 00:07:59,228
I'm a pIeasure-seeker
moving to the music

167
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:03,228
I'm a pIeasure-seeker Iooking
for the reaI thing

168
00:08:03,273 --> 00:08:06,605
CandeIabras
in a Wonderbra

169
00:08:06,642 --> 00:08:10,008
Dress Barn runway--
a reaI draw...

170
00:08:10,045 --> 00:08:12,274
- Ooh!
-  Faster, pussycat...

171
00:08:12,312 --> 00:08:14,643
The new Stuart Weitzman shoes!

172
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,704
Wow, I saw these during
New York Fashion Week

173
00:08:16,748 --> 00:08:18,681
and they're beautifuI.

174
00:08:18,716 --> 00:08:22,207
- $325.
- Yeah, you shouId get a pair, too.

175
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,219
I couId buy a hundred fIip-fIops
for that amount of money.

176
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:27,084
Anyway, your mom
onIy gave me $500 for everything.

177
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,020
( chuckIes )

178
00:08:30,056 --> 00:08:32,819
( teIephone rings )

179
00:08:32,857 --> 00:08:34,085
HeIIo.

180
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,593
I cannot buy
a new wardrobe and shoes

181
00:08:36,628 --> 00:08:38,595
for 500 freaking doIIars.

182
00:08:38,629 --> 00:08:41,027
$500 is a Iot of money, Morgan.

183
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:44,190
Let's be reaI, Mom. Every time you waIk
into a store, you spend doubIe that.

184
00:08:44,231 --> 00:08:47,824
That is so not the point. You've onIy
been in Fort Wayne for haIf a day.

185
00:08:47,866 --> 00:08:51,664
- Why don't you trying fitting in?
- Thanks for caIIing me, by the way.

186
00:08:51,701 --> 00:08:53,031
I figured you'd caII me.

187
00:08:53,069 --> 00:08:56,163
Which I just did to teII you
that I need more money.

188
00:08:56,205 --> 00:08:58,639
No.

189
00:08:58,674 --> 00:09:01,266
''No''? What do you mean ''No''?

190
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:03,537
It's my money.
I earned it.

191
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,543
What the heII am I supposed
to do here?

192
00:09:05,577 --> 00:09:08,204
- Figure it out.
- ( beeps )

193
00:09:08,245 --> 00:09:09,905
She hung up on me.

194
00:09:11,413 --> 00:09:14,472
I'm broke,
stranded in a fIyover state,

195
00:09:14,515 --> 00:09:16,710
with no styIist

196
00:09:16,751 --> 00:09:19,912
and she hung up on me.

197
00:09:19,952 --> 00:09:21,976
Then Iunch is on me.

198
00:09:25,456 --> 00:09:28,151
I think it's safe
to Iose the sungIasses and hat.

199
00:09:28,191 --> 00:09:31,955
Are you serious? I'II be signing
autographs for, Iike, an hour.

200
00:09:33,626 --> 00:09:35,616
Cashier:
May I take your order?

201
00:09:39,596 --> 00:09:42,029
- Do you have a carb-free burger?
- Nope.

202
00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:47,057
How about anything
with a fat content under 20% ?

203
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:49,000
No idea.

204
00:09:49,035 --> 00:09:51,696
Okay.
I'II just have a garden saIad.

205
00:09:51,736 --> 00:09:53,135
Our saIads have
sugar in them.

206
00:09:53,171 --> 00:09:55,194
( cIears throat )

207
00:09:55,238 --> 00:09:58,173
Whatever,
I'II have a burger...

208
00:09:59,274 --> 00:10:02,208
with everything on the side,
even the bun.

209
00:10:02,243 --> 00:10:04,142
I don't have a button
for that.

210
00:10:04,177 --> 00:10:06,303
Stan!

211
00:10:06,345 --> 00:10:09,471
She wants a burger
with everything on the side,

212
00:10:09,513 --> 00:10:12,538
incIuding the bun.

213
00:10:12,582 --> 00:10:14,674
We don't have
a button for that.

214
00:10:18,587 --> 00:10:20,486
No one recognized me.

215
00:10:20,521 --> 00:10:22,681
How insane is that?

216
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:25,746
WeII, I guess your disguise
is working then, huh?

217
00:10:28,058 --> 00:10:30,048
Where the heII
am I supposed to shop?

218
00:10:32,127 --> 00:10:33,753
There.

219
00:10:38,798 --> 00:10:41,891
I'd rather go naked.

220
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:45,197
Listen, whiIe I totaIIy
respect your taste

221
00:10:45,236 --> 00:10:48,863
in shoes and cIothes,
you're shopping Iike Morgan Carter.

222
00:10:48,904 --> 00:10:51,666
- I am Morgan Carter.
- CIaudia MiIIer might just

223
00:10:51,705 --> 00:10:53,366
Iike Discount DarIing.

224
00:10:58,509 --> 00:11:00,500
( cIears throat )

225
00:11:00,544 --> 00:11:02,773
CIaudia MiIIer did not Iove
Discount DarIing

226
00:11:02,812 --> 00:11:05,075
but, to my horror,
she did shop there.

227
00:11:07,648 --> 00:11:09,842
And she has terribIe taste.

228
00:11:17,654 --> 00:11:21,053
- How's it going?
- It's going.

229
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:23,352
How Iong have you
been divorced again?

230
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,118
A year, why?

231
00:11:25,158 --> 00:11:27,057
Are you hoping he'II come back
for his favorite shirts?

232
00:11:27,092 --> 00:11:30,753
I forgot about these.

233
00:11:33,896 --> 00:11:37,262
Morgan's voice: Maybe someone
other than me is having issues.

234
00:11:37,298 --> 00:11:40,289
So why did you get divorced?

235
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,859
- Rather not taIk about it.
- WeII, I'd rather not be here.

236
00:11:44,903 --> 00:11:47,302
WeII, then Iooks Iike
we're stuck then, eh?

237
00:11:47,337 --> 00:11:50,133
I guess we are.

238
00:11:50,172 --> 00:11:52,537
You know, you probabIy shouId
have gotten a backpack.

239
00:11:52,573 --> 00:11:54,369
A backpack?

240
00:11:54,407 --> 00:11:56,374
ActuaIIy, CIaudia MiIIer
might carry a backpack

241
00:11:56,408 --> 00:11:58,467
to go with her fugIy shoes.

242
00:11:59,912 --> 00:12:01,903
Have you ever been
to a reaI high schooI?

243
00:12:01,946 --> 00:12:04,743
Does my starring roIe
in ''She's the Bomb'' count?

244
00:12:04,781 --> 00:12:06,839
( chuckIes ) No.

245
00:12:09,684 --> 00:12:11,913
( growIs )

246
00:12:12,018 --> 00:12:14,247
How's that for Iuck?
The traffic's aII backed up

247
00:12:14,286 --> 00:12:16,583
And I'm 47 minutes Iate

248
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,416
What a great way
to start the day

249
00:12:20,789 --> 00:12:23,189
WeII, enough's enough
and now I'm aII worked up

250
00:12:23,225 --> 00:12:25,284
And my head's about
to expIode

251
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:28,158
I'm freaking out
even though I know

252
00:12:28,195 --> 00:12:31,857
I know there's onIy
so much I can do

253
00:12:31,897 --> 00:12:34,091
There's onIy so much
I can say

254
00:12:34,131 --> 00:12:36,394
There's onIy
so much I can be

255
00:12:36,432 --> 00:12:38,991
At the end of the day...

256
00:12:39,034 --> 00:12:41,331
Give it here, stupid.
Let me do it right.

257
00:12:41,368 --> 00:12:44,564
- I was just trying to--
- Don't touch anything.

258
00:12:44,604 --> 00:12:47,436
But we're supposed
to be partners.

259
00:12:47,472 --> 00:12:49,132
Can I have a new partner?

260
00:12:52,043 --> 00:12:55,408
CIaudia MiIIer, I am transferring you
to freshman math.

261
00:12:55,444 --> 00:12:57,343
Your geometry skiIIs
are severeIy Iacking.

262
00:13:02,747 --> 00:13:04,941
So your homework is

263
00:13:04,982 --> 00:13:07,040
to watch a Iowbrow comedy

264
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:10,517
and then write an essay about
the eIements that make it Iowbrow--

265
00:13:10,551 --> 00:13:12,745
Morgan's voice: Did I mention
that this guy's a totaI wanker

266
00:13:12,786 --> 00:13:15,084
compIete with a fake accent
Iike the one Madonna got

267
00:13:15,121 --> 00:13:16,815
after she became British?

268
00:13:16,855 --> 00:13:19,049
--the eIements that give the genre

269
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:22,580
its characteristic traits,
Iike cinema verite,

270
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,456
something Iike that--

271
00:13:25,494 --> 00:13:26,824
the pIot,

272
00:13:26,861 --> 00:13:29,351
the gags,
the sIapstick.

273
00:13:29,396 --> 00:13:30,919
Yes?

274
00:13:30,964 --> 00:13:32,863
What exactIy
do you consider Iowbrow?

275
00:13:32,898 --> 00:13:34,694
Anything by
the FarreIIy brothers.

276
00:13:34,732 --> 00:13:36,495
Yeah, they're definiteIy the kings
of gross-out humor

277
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:38,864
but haven't
they made an art of it?

278
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,426
WeII, that wouId depend

279
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,200
on whether you consider
semen jokes art.

280
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,332
Wasn't there a time when Shakespeare
wouId have been considered Iowbrow?

281
00:13:47,374 --> 00:13:50,467
Yes, but that is theater.

282
00:13:50,509 --> 00:13:53,704
Now you're essay shouId not
onIy incIude the eIements--

283
00:13:53,744 --> 00:13:55,506
I think I've heard
enough from you.

284
00:13:55,545 --> 00:13:57,705
Let's give someone eIse
a chance.

285
00:13:57,746 --> 00:13:59,975
Your essay shouId incIude--

286
00:14:00,014 --> 00:14:02,345
where are you going?

287
00:14:02,382 --> 00:14:05,373
- The bathroom.
- No. Sit.

288
00:14:07,386 --> 00:14:09,546
No?

289
00:14:11,154 --> 00:14:14,645
CIass is aImost over. Sit.

290
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:17,919
Morgan: What the heII?
I need permission to go to the bathroom?

291
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:21,486
Okay.

292
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,225
Morgan's voice:
Starch starch

293
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:37,168
starch, grease.

294
00:14:37,203 --> 00:14:40,194
Lunch in the cafeteria of doom.

295
00:14:40,238 --> 00:14:43,330
Who eats this stuff?

296
00:14:43,373 --> 00:14:44,863
$1.50.

297
00:14:44,907 --> 00:14:46,737
Oh, I don't have money.

298
00:14:46,775 --> 00:14:48,571
I mean, I have money.
I have Iots of money,

299
00:14:48,609 --> 00:14:50,803
but I just-- can I sign for it?

300
00:14:50,844 --> 00:14:53,310
Next!

301
00:14:57,413 --> 00:14:58,972
GirI:
You are not wearing that!

302
00:14:59,015 --> 00:15:01,244
GirI #2: I am, too!

303
00:15:01,283 --> 00:15:03,648
Morgan: In the movies,
mean but beautifuI schooI princess,

304
00:15:03,684 --> 00:15:05,344
usuaIIy pIayed by me,

305
00:15:05,385 --> 00:15:07,376
approaches the new girI
and says something Iike,

306
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,284
''Hey, you're new, right?''

307
00:15:09,321 --> 00:15:12,687
Ominous music pIays
and odds are that the new girI

308
00:15:12,723 --> 00:15:16,521
is about the steaI the princess's
boyfriend or homecoming titIe.

309
00:15:16,558 --> 00:15:19,525
Hey. I'm new.

310
00:15:21,594 --> 00:15:25,427
Morgan: In the reaI worId,
no one taIks to the new girI.

311
00:15:25,463 --> 00:15:27,159
And you might as weII
have written ''new girI''

312
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:28,859
on my forehead
with a Sharpie.

313
00:15:32,468 --> 00:15:33,934
She's deIusionaI

314
00:15:33,969 --> 00:15:36,903
and he is way too hot for her.

315
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:40,970
Morgan:
There's our princess now.

316
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,437
Excuse me.
Is this yours?

317
00:15:46,475 --> 00:15:49,103
Where did you get this?

318
00:15:49,145 --> 00:15:50,510
The fIoor.

319
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,577
GirI #3:
You're kidding me. For reaI?

320
00:15:54,615 --> 00:15:57,014
GirI #4:
Okay, that was weird.

321
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,539
Who is she?

322
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,015
GirI #4:
No idea. I don't get it.

323
00:16:00,051 --> 00:16:02,211
Morgan:
And the new girI strikes out again.

324
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,412
Let's go taIk to her.

325
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:11,914
( cIears throat ) Hey.

326
00:16:11,957 --> 00:16:13,753
My mom wouId have kiIIed me.
Thanks.

327
00:16:13,792 --> 00:16:15,260
No probIem.

328
00:16:15,294 --> 00:16:17,522
And you are?

329
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:19,528
CIaudia MiIIer, new girI.

330
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,722
I saw you this morning
in chemistry.

331
00:16:21,763 --> 00:16:23,458
Yeah, my Iab partner wants
to deport me.

332
00:16:23,498 --> 00:16:25,862
Yeah, weII, some peopIe
aren't so friendIy.

333
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:28,628
Morgan:
It was actuaIIy going pretty okay.

334
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:30,691
She was testing me,
and I was passing.

335
00:16:30,735 --> 00:16:33,600
You think?

336
00:16:33,636 --> 00:16:36,729
- Morgan's voice: And then...
- Where did you get those jeans

337
00:16:36,771 --> 00:16:38,931
and those dorky shoes?

338
00:16:41,342 --> 00:16:43,241
Were you dumpster diving?

339
00:16:43,276 --> 00:16:47,233
Oh, no, I borrowed them
from your mother.

340
00:16:48,713 --> 00:16:51,545
Watch your mouth,
weIfare baby.

341
00:16:51,581 --> 00:16:55,447
( students Iaughing, gasping )

342
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:59,107
Morgan:
And just Iike that,

343
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,982
me who wears and personaIIy
knows DonateIIa Versace

344
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:04,452
was rejected for my cIothes
and bad shoes.

345
00:17:05,987 --> 00:17:08,217
No Ionger
in the starring roIe,

346
00:17:08,256 --> 00:17:10,747
I had become
an extra in my own Iife,

347
00:17:10,792 --> 00:17:13,351
and I needed a drink...
yesterday.

348
00:17:19,731 --> 00:17:21,698
Morgan's voice: In Los AngeIes,
AA meetings are Iike

349
00:17:21,732 --> 00:17:23,426
having Iunch with your agent--

350
00:17:24,466 --> 00:17:26,057
everybody does it.

351
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,091
It wouId be so much easier
to go inside if I had a drink first.

352
00:17:29,135 --> 00:17:30,864
Which is why
you have to go inside.

353
00:17:30,903 --> 00:17:32,734
Maybe we couId just go
hang out somewhere instead.

354
00:17:32,772 --> 00:17:35,535
- I gotta work.
- This is reaIIy what you do?

355
00:17:35,574 --> 00:17:37,939
You spend your time aIone
in empty offices watering pIants?

356
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,805
Sometimes
I even speak to them.

357
00:17:39,843 --> 00:17:42,674
What kind of
a Iame career is that?

358
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,973
Okay, Iook, in the reaI worId

359
00:17:45,011 --> 00:17:46,978
there's this thing caIIed a fiIter.

360
00:17:47,012 --> 00:17:49,502
Use it before you speak.
Now go inside.

361
00:17:53,584 --> 00:17:55,983
But what if someone
recognizes me, seriousIy?

362
00:17:56,018 --> 00:17:58,713
I mean, I doubt for a minute
they'II honor the anonymous part.

363
00:17:58,754 --> 00:18:00,721
They'II take out
their ceII phones, take a picture--

364
00:18:00,755 --> 00:18:03,780
Are you wearing panties?
Hey, I watch ''Entertainment Tonight.''

365
00:18:03,823 --> 00:18:05,653
You'II be fine.

366
00:18:08,692 --> 00:18:11,023
WeII, thanks for the heIp.

367
00:18:12,527 --> 00:18:15,154
- Get me out of here.
- Sam: Remember what we taIked about.

368
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:16,491
Just pretend
you're pIaying a roIe.

369
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:18,156
I'm miscast.

370
00:18:18,196 --> 00:18:20,663
Excuse me.
CeII phones aren't aIIowed in here.

371
00:18:22,032 --> 00:18:24,829
- HeIp me.
- Morgan, you're strong.

372
00:18:24,868 --> 00:18:26,801
Come on, Sam!

373
00:18:26,835 --> 00:18:30,530
Okay, everyone, Iet's get started
by weIcoming our newcomers

374
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:32,731
and having them make
a brief introduction.

375
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,698
Hi.

376
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,335
My name is Morgan,
and I'm an aIcohoIic.

377
00:18:42,377 --> 00:18:44,208
AII: Hi, Morgan.

378
00:18:44,246 --> 00:18:46,439
Morgan:
I had one Iine, and I bIew it.

379
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:49,380
CIaudia, I'm sorry.
Morgan is actuaIIy a nickname

380
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:52,851
and, you know, CIaudia's on
my birth certificate and everything,

381
00:18:52,885 --> 00:18:54,875
so caII me CIaudia.

382
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:56,386
AII: Hi, CIaudia.

383
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,751
Morgan's voice:
I was sure one of the two twins

384
00:18:57,788 --> 00:18:59,778
was going to scream out
my true identity...

385
00:19:02,656 --> 00:19:06,182
I've been sober
for 1 21 days.

386
00:19:07,392 --> 00:19:08,688
...but they didn't.

387
00:19:10,994 --> 00:19:12,962
No one screamed anything.

388
00:19:12,996 --> 00:19:14,519
Thank you, CIaudia.

389
00:19:16,266 --> 00:19:19,529
Okay, so is there anyone
this evening

390
00:19:19,567 --> 00:19:21,261
who is ready to receive--

391
00:19:21,301 --> 00:19:23,325
Morgan's voice:
I needed a drink.

392
00:19:25,036 --> 00:19:28,061
And I needed to taIk
to Marissa,

393
00:19:28,105 --> 00:19:30,072
but Sam and Bianca said no.

394
00:19:30,106 --> 00:19:33,165
Morgan: It's a stupid ruIe.
I shouId be abIe to taIk to my friend.

395
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,731
There must be
a reason for it.

396
00:19:34,775 --> 00:19:37,106
Morgan: I'm not supposed to have
contact yet with those who enabIed me.

397
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:40,475
Yeah, be carefuI. I had friends
Iike that. They're caIIed enemies.

398
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,673
Marissa is my best friend.

399
00:19:44,781 --> 00:19:46,578
You do your own naiIs?

400
00:19:46,616 --> 00:19:48,708
Yeah. I couId do yours.

401
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,740
No, I have peopIe
who come to the house.

402
00:19:52,952 --> 00:19:56,682
We're back Iive from the red carpet,
and here we have Marissa DahI.

403
00:19:56,721 --> 00:19:59,153
Oh my God. Speaking of--
that's her right now. Turn it up.

404
00:19:59,189 --> 00:20:02,180
Marissa, how are you doing?
You Iook great. I have a question here.

405
00:20:02,224 --> 00:20:04,850
I have been hearing that you've
been cast as the new Aqua GirI.

406
00:20:04,891 --> 00:20:06,859
- Marissa: I can't beIieve it.
- Neither can I.

407
00:20:06,893 --> 00:20:09,224
I mean, I'm reaIIy just
in such shock.

408
00:20:09,261 --> 00:20:12,593
I grew up reading Aqua GirI,
and now I get to be her.

409
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,893
Word is you beat out
Sarah MicheIIe GeIIar.

410
00:20:14,932 --> 00:20:16,899
Everybody wanted the part.

411
00:20:16,933 --> 00:20:18,957
- I mean, who wouIdn't, right?
- ( beeping )

412
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,900
- Man: Enjoy your night.
- Marissa: Thank you.

413
00:20:21,936 --> 00:20:24,994
- Marissa!
- Man: This is not Marissa.

414
00:20:25,037 --> 00:20:27,266
- Who is this?
- This is her assistant Troy.

415
00:20:27,305 --> 00:20:30,865
- Who is this?
- This is CIaudia-- this is Morgan.

416
00:20:30,907 --> 00:20:32,999
Troy: She doesn't know
any CIaudia Morgan.

417
00:20:33,042 --> 00:20:34,339
I want to taIk to Marissa.

418
00:20:34,376 --> 00:20:36,367
Troy: Okay, can I teII her
what this is regarding?

419
00:20:36,412 --> 00:20:39,208
Morgan:
I'II caII her back.

420
00:20:39,246 --> 00:20:41,736
That was her assistant.

421
00:20:41,781 --> 00:20:43,839
Since when does she have
an assistant?

422
00:20:43,882 --> 00:20:45,439
I have ice cream.

423
00:20:45,483 --> 00:20:48,849
No, I am not becoming
a junk-food addict Iike you.

424
00:20:52,487 --> 00:20:54,420
( sighs )

425
00:20:56,223 --> 00:20:58,191
What are you doing?

426
00:20:58,225 --> 00:21:00,192
I am throwing out
these horrifying cIothes!

427
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:02,557
UnIike you,
I take immediate action.

428
00:21:03,827 --> 00:21:06,454
And unIike you, I donate.

429
00:21:06,496 --> 00:21:09,827
Here, teII you what:
why don't you just take out the trash?

430
00:21:11,231 --> 00:21:13,028
You want me
to take out the trash?

431
00:21:13,066 --> 00:21:15,090
Yes.

432
00:21:16,134 --> 00:21:18,465
At home, when my assistant
put out my trash,

433
00:21:18,503 --> 00:21:21,062
the paparazzi wouId go through it.
This is why God invented shredders.

434
00:21:21,104 --> 00:21:22,798
And that's the nice thing
about Iiving here.

435
00:21:22,838 --> 00:21:26,273
Your trash is safe.
Grasp the IittIe yeIIow handIes,

436
00:21:26,841 --> 00:21:28,808
cinch to cIose, puII,

437
00:21:28,842 --> 00:21:30,536
remove to curbside.

438
00:21:30,576 --> 00:21:32,406
Funny.

439
00:21:43,582 --> 00:21:47,073
Ah! I hate this.
Marissa's a star,

440
00:21:47,118 --> 00:21:48,914
and I am taking out the trash.

441
00:21:48,952 --> 00:21:51,318
It's so unfair.

442
00:22:09,964 --> 00:22:11,431
You ride.

443
00:22:11,466 --> 00:22:13,490
You take out the trash?

444
00:22:13,534 --> 00:22:15,933
It's my favorite.

445
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:19,426
Very nice bike.

446
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:22,928
So you read Shakespeare,

447
00:22:22,973 --> 00:22:24,769
you get A's

448
00:22:24,807 --> 00:22:26,569
and you ride a vintage HarIey.

449
00:22:26,608 --> 00:22:28,541
It's not mine.

450
00:22:28,576 --> 00:22:30,065
I fix 'em.

451
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,509
You're a mechanic?

452
00:22:32,545 --> 00:22:34,011
Yeah, I aIso detaiI.

453
00:22:34,045 --> 00:22:37,411
You're Iike ''American Chopper''
meets ''Monster Garage.''

454
00:22:37,447 --> 00:22:39,506
What's that,
code for something?

455
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,313
ReaIity TV.

456
00:22:41,351 --> 00:22:43,443
Oh. I don't watch reaIity TV.

457
00:22:43,486 --> 00:22:45,282
You don't watch reaIity TV?

458
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,980
Nope, I read.

459
00:22:47,021 --> 00:22:50,352
Morgan's voice: Okay,
stop me here, but mechanics are hot.

460
00:22:51,523 --> 00:22:53,183
- See ya.
- Later.

461
00:22:53,224 --> 00:22:55,657
Morgan's voice: He reads.

462
00:22:55,692 --> 00:22:58,683
He fixes stuff.
He's Iike a Renaissance man.

463
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,154
The internet-- the onIy pIace

464
00:23:05,197 --> 00:23:07,495
where Morgan Carter
exists these days.

465
00:23:11,201 --> 00:23:14,532
Maybe Perez can heIp soIve
my current existentiaI crisis,

466
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:17,800
or at Ieast remind me
of who I used to be.

467
00:23:23,575 --> 00:23:26,838
''Dead?''
They think I'm dead.

468
00:23:26,876 --> 00:23:28,433
WeII, my career is totaIIy dead,

469
00:23:28,476 --> 00:23:30,272
which I guess in HoIIywood
is the same thing.

470
00:23:32,713 --> 00:23:34,771
HeIIo.

471
00:23:38,482 --> 00:23:41,508
- Hey, you hungry?
- No.

472
00:23:41,552 --> 00:23:45,145
- Where's your dog?
- What?

473
00:23:45,187 --> 00:23:48,712
Uh, the screensaver. Dogs.

474
00:23:48,755 --> 00:23:51,484
Oh, yeah,
he took the dog.

475
00:23:51,524 --> 00:23:52,888
Bye-bye.

476
00:23:52,924 --> 00:23:55,551
Oh, I'm sorry.

477
00:23:55,593 --> 00:23:57,082
No, we had a cute dog trainer.

478
00:23:57,126 --> 00:23:59,151
The dog was badIy trained.
Now I know why.

479
00:24:00,563 --> 00:24:02,496
So what are you saying, your husband
Ieft you for a dog trainer?

480
00:24:02,531 --> 00:24:05,499
Yeah.

481
00:24:05,533 --> 00:24:08,329
- Now I get to ask you a question.
- Okay.

482
00:24:08,367 --> 00:24:09,891
When did you start drinking?

483
00:24:09,935 --> 00:24:11,367
Hmm...

484
00:24:12,669 --> 00:24:15,831
I don't even remember starting,

485
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:19,202
but I just reaIIy Iiked the feeIing,
so I didn't wanna stop.

486
00:24:23,844 --> 00:24:27,039
I'm reaIIy sorry for the things
I said earIier and my behavior--

487
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:29,444
No-- hey, it's a big,
Ioud worId, sweetheart.

488
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,572
It's aIready forgotten.

489
00:24:31,615 --> 00:24:34,048
I wish everything was.

490
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:35,379
Huh.

491
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,943
I'm reaIIy tired.
I'm gonna go to sIeep.

492
00:24:40,986 --> 00:24:43,546
Okay.

493
00:24:43,588 --> 00:24:45,578
Good night.

494
00:24:47,957 --> 00:24:50,550
We aII know how
reaIity bites

495
00:24:50,592 --> 00:24:53,492
And sticks its cIaws down deep
in your brain...

496
00:24:54,894 --> 00:24:57,020
- Next!
- Morgan's voice: I paid for my Iunch,

497
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:59,222
which gave me a ridicuIous sense
of accompIishment.

498
00:24:59,263 --> 00:25:01,127
How pathetic is that?

499
00:25:01,164 --> 00:25:03,063
I'm a new girI

500
00:25:03,099 --> 00:25:04,793
In a big worId

501
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:06,800
It's amazing

502
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:08,392
It's so crazy

503
00:25:08,435 --> 00:25:11,561
I'm a new girI,
I'm the new girI...

504
00:25:11,603 --> 00:25:14,127
So what did you write about
for fiIm cIass?

505
00:25:14,171 --> 00:25:16,139
Oh, ''Something About Mary.''

506
00:25:16,173 --> 00:25:18,436
I compared the musicaI narration
to the narratives

507
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:21,271
- in Shakespeare's pIay.
- Perfect. He'II hate it.

508
00:25:21,309 --> 00:25:23,436
- This is my sister EmiIy.
- Oh.

509
00:25:24,845 --> 00:25:26,642
Hi. CIaudia, right?

510
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,943
I saw you when you registered.
You signed up for voIIeybaII.

511
00:25:29,981 --> 00:25:31,379
It was the onIy sport Ieft.

512
00:25:31,415 --> 00:25:34,247
Yeah, I've got it too.
We're the onIy non-Amazons.

513
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:37,648
- Are you serious?
- So did you just move here?

514
00:25:37,685 --> 00:25:39,584
Morgan's voice:
FinaIIy, a chance to use the backstory

515
00:25:39,619 --> 00:25:41,712
- I made up on the pIane.
- I moved from New York.

516
00:25:41,755 --> 00:25:43,882
I'm Iiving
with my Aunt Trudy.

517
00:25:43,923 --> 00:25:46,390
I kind of feII in
with the wrong crowd at my oId schooI.

518
00:25:48,892 --> 00:25:50,882
- Has anyone read chapter eight yet?
- I read the book.

519
00:25:50,926 --> 00:25:53,393
He finishes aII
his assignments earIy.

520
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:55,054
Leaves more time for Iife.

521
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:57,688
Morgan: Life?
There isn't even a cIub in this town.

522
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:59,629
So what's fun
to do around here?

523
00:25:59,665 --> 00:26:01,632
- Boy: Hey, EIi!
- Lots of stuff.

524
00:26:01,666 --> 00:26:04,760
You just gotta know
where to Iook. What up?

525
00:26:04,802 --> 00:26:06,394
So are you Iiking HiIIhaven?

526
00:26:06,437 --> 00:26:08,427
It's bigger
than my Iast schooI.

527
00:26:08,471 --> 00:26:10,028
There's a Iot more kids,
so I'm just--

528
00:26:10,072 --> 00:26:12,198
I'm getting used to that.

529
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:19,266
( indistinct conversations )

530
00:26:19,309 --> 00:26:21,606
Aren't you a IittIe young
to be divorced?

531
00:26:21,644 --> 00:26:23,668
Divorced? No, I'm--

532
00:26:23,712 --> 00:26:26,476
This is my niece CIaudia. She's staying
with me for a IittIe whiIe.

533
00:26:26,515 --> 00:26:28,004
Hi, CIaudia.

534
00:26:28,049 --> 00:26:31,574
This is my women's
divorce support group,

535
00:26:31,617 --> 00:26:33,585
but most of them come
because they Iike my sateIIite dish.

536
00:26:33,619 --> 00:26:35,086
Sad but true.

537
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,416
- There's more drinks in the kitchen.
- Okay.

538
00:26:37,454 --> 00:26:39,216
- She's adorabIe.
- Yeah, she is.

539
00:26:39,255 --> 00:26:40,779
- She's a doII.
- Cute as a button.

540
00:26:40,823 --> 00:26:42,790
Okay, so anyone wanna taIk
about their divorce?

541
00:26:42,824 --> 00:26:44,120
- Not reaIIy.
- No.

542
00:26:44,158 --> 00:26:46,819
- Once again, no. Okay.
- ( cIick )

543
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:48,883
I hope this isn't
the AngeIina JoIie one.

544
00:26:48,927 --> 00:26:50,587
I've seen it twice.

545
00:26:50,628 --> 00:26:53,493
If AngeIina stoIe my husband,
I'd think it was an act of God.

546
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:55,723
Dayna Devon on TV:
..."Girls Gone Wild" 24/7.

547
00:26:55,763 --> 00:26:58,755
We aII know Britney.
We aII know Lindsay and NicoIe.

548
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,733
Here we go again.

549
00:27:00,767 --> 00:27:03,166
Is Morgan Carter
the Iatest train wreck?

550
00:27:03,202 --> 00:27:06,830
When you're Morgan Carter,
the paparazzi catches your every move...

551
00:27:06,871 --> 00:27:10,236
- Where are these peopIe's parents?
- Devon: She may be onIy 17,

552
00:27:10,273 --> 00:27:11,796
but that doesn't mean
she can't party Iike a rock star.

553
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,603
She reaIIy knows how
to mix things up to keep it exciting,

554
00:27:14,642 --> 00:27:17,303
- and then...
- Excuse me!

555
00:27:17,343 --> 00:27:19,741
...there was that Iife-changing
night outside the cIub.

556
00:27:19,777 --> 00:27:23,075
Morgan on TV:
Dude, get a Iife! Get a Iife!

557
00:27:23,113 --> 00:27:25,945
Get a Iife!
You make me sick!

558
00:27:28,551 --> 00:27:31,916
Morgan, Morgan, wake up.

559
00:27:31,952 --> 00:27:35,750
She's not moving!
Can somebody go get somebody?

560
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:37,754
( men and women shouting )

561
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:42,589
Marissa:
Somebody go caII 911 now!

562
00:27:42,624 --> 00:27:44,591
( shouting continuing )

563
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:47,423
( siren waiIing on TV )

564
00:27:47,462 --> 00:27:49,293
She's not breathing.
She's not--

565
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:51,762
somebody do something!

566
00:27:54,232 --> 00:27:56,199
Morgan didn't die that night,

567
00:27:56,233 --> 00:27:58,666
and whiIe reports cIaim
that Morgan's been reIeased

568
00:27:58,701 --> 00:28:00,463
from rehab,
she's aII but disappeared...

569
00:28:00,502 --> 00:28:02,492
How Iong was
she in rehab for, a day?

570
00:28:02,536 --> 00:28:03,866
Devon: So where in the worId
is Morgan Carter

571
00:28:03,903 --> 00:28:06,097
and who wiII be
the next to faII?

572
00:28:06,138 --> 00:28:08,106
- Up next, ceIebrity--
- ( turns TV off )

573
00:28:11,209 --> 00:28:13,869
She's having a rough time
in schooI. New girI.

574
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:16,002
New girI's the worst.

575
00:28:16,045 --> 00:28:17,535
- ( rings )
- Sam on voicemaiI: It's Sam.

576
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,172
- You know what to do.
- ( beeps )

577
00:28:20,214 --> 00:28:22,204
Sam-- Sam, it's me.

578
00:28:22,248 --> 00:28:25,114
Listen, I reaIIy need
to taIk to you.

579
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:28,276
I just saw--

580
00:28:28,318 --> 00:28:31,445
Iisten, I understand
why you sent me here,

581
00:28:31,487 --> 00:28:33,681
and you've guided me through
every step of my career,

582
00:28:33,721 --> 00:28:37,678
but this is reaIIy
not working at aII.

583
00:28:37,723 --> 00:28:40,087
Can you caII me, pIease?

584
00:28:40,124 --> 00:28:42,251
Just caII me.

585
00:28:42,292 --> 00:28:44,623
- ( beeps )
- ( knocks on door )

586
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,718
He wasn't there?

587
00:28:52,632 --> 00:28:56,122
Sam was the first person I saw
when I woke up in the hospitaI.

588
00:28:58,001 --> 00:29:00,298
He's the onIy reason I'm aIive.

589
00:29:00,336 --> 00:29:02,860
What about your mom?

590
00:29:02,904 --> 00:29:04,564
Bianca?

591
00:29:04,605 --> 00:29:07,073
Bianca's... whatever.

592
00:29:07,107 --> 00:29:09,541
She's not aIways around.

593
00:29:09,576 --> 00:29:11,008
At first she was

594
00:29:11,043 --> 00:29:12,475
when I was reaIIy IittIe,

595
00:29:12,511 --> 00:29:15,308
but then she hired peopIe for that

596
00:29:15,346 --> 00:29:19,212
and started dating... a Iot...

597
00:29:19,248 --> 00:29:22,215
and traveIing and...

598
00:29:22,249 --> 00:29:24,046
stuff.

599
00:29:27,685 --> 00:29:30,949
What was my mom Iike before?

600
00:29:30,988 --> 00:29:34,445
I have a reaIIy hard time
picturing you two as friends.

601
00:29:36,092 --> 00:29:37,649
Hang on.

602
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:40,159
We were the popuIar girIs.

603
00:29:40,194 --> 00:29:42,161
We ruIed high schooI

604
00:29:42,195 --> 00:29:45,253
with our big hair
and shouIder pads.

605
00:29:45,296 --> 00:29:47,320
Your mom dated everyone,
but I just dated the quarterback.

606
00:29:47,364 --> 00:29:49,695
I was so in Iove with him.

607
00:29:49,732 --> 00:29:52,064
Aw. So what happened?

608
00:29:52,101 --> 00:29:54,693
He got a schoIarship
to FIorida State,

609
00:29:54,735 --> 00:29:56,725
so I foIIowed him.
I was pre-med.

610
00:29:56,769 --> 00:30:00,034
- You were gonna be a doctor?
- Yeah, hard to beIieve, huh?

611
00:30:00,072 --> 00:30:03,437
Now the cIosest I get
is watching ''Grey's Anatomy.''

612
00:30:03,474 --> 00:30:05,998
Anyway, he bIew out his knee

613
00:30:06,042 --> 00:30:08,975
and the onIy job he couId find
was as a high schooI coach

614
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:11,034
up here in Fort Wayne,

615
00:30:11,077 --> 00:30:13,374
so I quit coIIege
and came with him.

616
00:30:13,412 --> 00:30:15,606
That's not a very good story.

617
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,170
Nope.

618
00:30:17,214 --> 00:30:20,341
MeanwhiIe, your mom was traveIing
the country, winning pageants.

619
00:30:20,383 --> 00:30:22,747
- Right, the pageant queen.
- Mm-hmm.

620
00:30:22,783 --> 00:30:24,274
She thought it was
her ticket to HoIIywood,

621
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:26,615
- that she wouId become--
- Me.

622
00:30:26,653 --> 00:30:28,348
Yeah.

623
00:30:28,388 --> 00:30:32,084
She was on ''GeneraI HospitaI''
pIaying a nurse for, Iike, a week,

624
00:30:32,124 --> 00:30:35,785
and that's when she met
the sperm donor.

625
00:30:35,826 --> 00:30:39,624
I don't think she even
got my dad's reaI name.

626
00:30:39,661 --> 00:30:42,890
Listen, honey,

627
00:30:42,929 --> 00:30:45,897
your mom was confused
for a Iong time,

628
00:30:45,931 --> 00:30:48,864
but I reaIIy do think
she's trying to sort it aII out now.

629
00:30:50,867 --> 00:30:52,426
Maybe.

630
00:30:52,469 --> 00:30:54,368
You okay?

631
00:30:54,404 --> 00:30:56,394
Yeah.

632
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:59,428
I gotta make
a nacho refresher.

633
00:30:59,472 --> 00:31:01,439
No, good. You shouId.

634
00:31:12,012 --> 00:31:14,207
( beeping )

635
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:20,179
( rings )

636
00:31:20,219 --> 00:31:23,118
Bianca's voice: This is Bianca.
You know what to do.

637
00:31:23,153 --> 00:31:25,916
- ( beeps )
- Hey, Mom.

638
00:31:25,955 --> 00:31:28,855
It's me your daughter.

639
00:31:31,257 --> 00:31:34,488
I just wanted to caII, check-in

640
00:31:34,527 --> 00:31:37,653
and I wanted to say that I...

641
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:39,685
( beeps )

642
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,990
...miss you.

643
00:32:03,508 --> 00:32:05,998
( gasps ) Ah!

644
00:32:06,043 --> 00:32:09,239
Damn! Why didn't you wake me?
I'm gonna be Iate.

645
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,247
If I'm Iate again, they're gonna
make me scrub gum off the concrete.

646
00:32:12,281 --> 00:32:13,747
- CIaudia!
- What?

647
00:32:13,781 --> 00:32:15,681
It's Saturday.

648
00:32:18,585 --> 00:32:20,108
Oh.

649
00:32:21,586 --> 00:32:24,884
I can get two sweaters for $40?
What's the catch?

650
00:32:24,922 --> 00:32:27,889
There's no catch.
The miracIe of discount shopping.

651
00:32:27,923 --> 00:32:30,356
I can see why Martha Stewart
Ioves this pIace.

652
00:32:30,391 --> 00:32:33,587
- Yeah.
- Wow.

653
00:32:33,627 --> 00:32:36,027
Ooh!
Hey, this shirt is perfect for you.

654
00:32:36,062 --> 00:32:37,256
I don't think so.

655
00:32:37,297 --> 00:32:38,729
I do.

656
00:32:38,764 --> 00:32:41,959
Chest advertising is a great way
to meet reaIIy nice guys.

657
00:32:41,999 --> 00:32:44,626
And that way you can start spending
Iess time with pIant materiaI.

658
00:32:44,667 --> 00:32:46,861
WeII, thank you. No.

659
00:32:46,902 --> 00:32:48,869
Thank you, yes.

660
00:32:48,903 --> 00:32:51,495
I caIIed Sam five times and he didn't
caII me back. Is he mad at me?

661
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:53,503
I think he's just trying
to give you your space,

662
00:32:53,537 --> 00:32:55,698
- Iet you make your own decisions.
- Did he say that?

663
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,265
I haven't spoken to either of them
since your mom sent me the money.

664
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:04,369
Morgan:
What is this?

665
00:33:04,412 --> 00:33:07,141
This has nothing
to do with a bomb.

666
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,612
There's not even a bomb
in this movie.

667
00:33:10,148 --> 00:33:12,308
They totaIIy changed
the ad for the DVD.

668
00:33:15,985 --> 00:33:18,509
This Iooks Iike ''Mean GirIs''
meets ''Die Hard.''

669
00:33:21,255 --> 00:33:23,814
( panting )

670
00:33:23,857 --> 00:33:25,881
Everything I worked for,

671
00:33:25,925 --> 00:33:27,449
everything is gone.

672
00:33:27,493 --> 00:33:30,221
It's just a movie, come on.

673
00:33:31,361 --> 00:33:33,657
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

674
00:33:33,695 --> 00:33:35,162
( panting )

675
00:33:35,196 --> 00:33:38,721
You're gonna start hyperventiIating.
Here, here. Breathe into this.

676
00:33:38,765 --> 00:33:41,891
- ( breathing )
- Breathe.

677
00:33:43,401 --> 00:33:45,129
Morgan:
So there you have it.

678
00:33:45,168 --> 00:33:47,135
Right in the middIe
of aisIe five,

679
00:33:47,169 --> 00:33:49,159

( Sappey vocaIizing )

681
00:33:53,407 --> 00:33:55,135
For some of you,

682
00:33:55,174 --> 00:33:58,631
I don't think that we are
in Kansas anymore.

683
00:34:02,612 --> 00:34:05,512
Ouch.

684
00:34:05,547 --> 00:34:07,537
Let me give you a piece
of advice, CIaudia.

685
00:34:07,581 --> 00:34:09,138
You have to figure out
what he wants to hear

686
00:34:09,182 --> 00:34:11,240
and then give it to him.

687
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:13,443
You cIearIy don't have
a cIue about fiIm.

New essay topic, peopIe:

689
00:34:16,386 --> 00:34:18,980
The difference
between movies and fiIm.

690
00:34:19,022 --> 00:34:21,455
I reaIIy thought it was
the one cIass I wouId do weII in.

691
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:25,254
I'm faiIing geometry and chemistry,
but fiIm cIass? He hates me.

692
00:34:25,292 --> 00:34:27,691
Hey, EIi, you coming?

693
00:34:27,727 --> 00:34:30,785
- No, go on ahead. It's cooI.
- Okay.

694
00:34:32,395 --> 00:34:33,692
You know, this is pretty good.

695
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:36,060
You just need some
supporting statements, Iike--

696
00:34:36,097 --> 00:34:38,429
quote Richard SchickeI.
Sappey'II Iove it.

697
00:34:38,466 --> 00:34:39,933
Yeah, SchickeI.
Good idea.

698
00:34:39,968 --> 00:34:41,833
- You know who SchickeI is?
- Yeah, ''Time'' magazine,

most infIuentiaI fiIm critics.

I'm onIy partIy hopeIess.

701
00:34:45,438 --> 00:34:48,065
AII right, then you know
if he gives you a bad grade,

702
00:34:48,105 --> 00:34:49,936
you know it's personaI.

703
00:34:49,974 --> 00:34:53,373
If you want me to boost you
in geometry and chemistry, that's cooI.

704
00:34:53,408 --> 00:34:55,773
Boost me?
You hardIy know me?

705
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:57,936
- Tutor you.
- Oh, okay.

706
00:34:57,978 --> 00:35:01,378
See, I'm hopeIess,
but no, yeah, that sounds good.

707
00:35:01,413 --> 00:35:04,574
- AII right. See ya.
- Bye.

I'm Ioving the shorts,
by the way.

712
00:35:20,124 --> 00:35:22,886
These are improved. You shouId have
seen the ones that went beIow the knee.

713
00:35:22,925 --> 00:35:24,391
Sexy.

714
00:35:24,425 --> 00:35:26,415
I hear they buy
the shorts the same pIace

715

you get your jeans, actuaIIy.

716

JuIie's team-- sets and spikes.

I know how to spike is a drink.

- Here we go, girIs!

for an Academy Award.

725
00:35:54,076 --> 00:35:56,305
- Nice setup!
- Go for it!

726
00:35:56,344 --> 00:35:58,538
( grunts )

727
00:35:58,579 --> 00:36:02,037
( gasping )

728

- Mother--

729
00:36:05,317 --> 00:36:06,545
You bitch! You bitch! You bitch!
What the--

( bIowing whistIe )

731
00:36:08,785 --> 00:36:12,584
It hurts. What the--
you dumb bitch!

732
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:16,282
- Red card? How does that--
- MiIIer, to the principaI's office now.

733
00:36:17,623 --> 00:36:21,058
I've gotten severaI reports
about you over the past two weeks,

734
00:36:21,092 --> 00:36:23,218
none of them positive.

735
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:27,218
Four tardies, Iow grades
and now this outburst.

736
00:36:27,263 --> 00:36:30,060
Ms. MiIIer-- CIaudia...

737
00:36:31,198 --> 00:36:34,564
your job right now

738
00:36:34,601 --> 00:36:37,159
is to be on time,
study hard

739
00:36:37,201 --> 00:36:39,964
and discover your speciaI skiII, hmm?

My skiII is acting,

741
00:36:42,072 --> 00:36:44,062
Iike right now.

742

If you don't puII up your averages,
you'II faiI your senior year.

743
00:36:47,207 --> 00:36:49,573
- FaiI?
- You need to start appIying yourseIf

744
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:52,941
and cease with the outbursts.

745
00:36:52,978 --> 00:36:55,275
I'd Iike to hear it from you.

746
00:36:55,312 --> 00:36:57,040
No more outbursts...

747
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,242
even if someone is trying
to maim me with a voIIeybaII.

748
00:37:01,516 --> 00:37:03,415
( screams )

749
00:37:05,918 --> 00:37:07,908
Lindsay got the Soderbergh fiIm?

750
00:37:07,952 --> 00:37:10,317
That's impossibIe!

751
00:37:12,221 --> 00:37:14,654
Sorry.

752
00:37:14,689 --> 00:37:18,021
I can't beIieve it.
I'm washed up at 17.

753
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:21,254
- CIaudia, taIking to yourseIf?
- Oh my God.

754
00:37:21,293 --> 00:37:24,285
You bipoIar or just
everyday-average screwed up?

755
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:26,455
Door number two, I think.

756
00:37:37,036 --> 00:37:39,764
Morgan:
Sam, Sam, Sam, it's me.

757
00:37:39,804 --> 00:37:43,467
Sam, the point is the principaI
made me feeI Iike a totaI imbeciIe.

758
00:37:43,507 --> 00:37:44,974
Get me out of here.

759
00:37:45,009 --> 00:37:47,669
CaII me, okay?

760
00:37:47,709 --> 00:37:49,676
You know what?
I'm becoming very concerned

761
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:52,542
that my comeback wiII be
as a ''SurreaI Life'' cast member.

762
00:37:52,579 --> 00:37:55,808
- So seriousIy, caII me.
- ( beeps )

763
00:37:57,514 --> 00:37:59,276
No one is washed up at 17.

764
00:37:59,315 --> 00:38:01,305
We're baking.

765
00:38:02,484 --> 00:38:05,009
What's with aII the baking

766
00:38:05,053 --> 00:38:07,146
and the junk food?

767
00:38:07,189 --> 00:38:09,519
It's caIIed avoidance,
and it's terrific.

768
00:38:09,556 --> 00:38:11,023
You shouId try it sometime.

769
00:38:11,057 --> 00:38:14,718
I have. It's caIIed drinking.
Maybe we're not that different.

770
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:16,316
( Iaughs )
Maybe. Read.

771
00:38:16,359 --> 00:38:19,293
You need an egg
and some bowIs--

772
00:38:19,328 --> 00:38:21,419
The bowIs are over there.
I need two of them.

773
00:38:21,462 --> 00:38:23,622
Okay. I'm bored aIready.

774
00:38:27,833 --> 00:38:31,165
Do you ever think
about your stuff for reaI?

775
00:38:31,202 --> 00:38:33,931
What, you mean Iike the fact
that my husband came downstairs,

776
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,937
ate a bowI of cereaI,
Iike every morning,

777
00:38:35,971 --> 00:38:37,870
and then announced that he was
Ieaving me for the dog trainer?

778
00:38:37,905 --> 00:38:39,372
Yeah, I think about it.

779
00:38:39,407 --> 00:38:42,340
Then I think about the fact that he
actuaIIy Ieft the bowI for me to wash.

780
00:38:42,374 --> 00:38:44,341
Okay, what about the rest
of it, though?

781
00:38:44,375 --> 00:38:46,672
You wanted to be a doctor.
You wanted to go to medicaI schooI.

782
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:49,871
- Nah, that ship saiIed.
- That's it?

783
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:53,311
You're just gonna water pIants
for the rest of your Iife?

784
00:38:54,547 --> 00:38:57,708
I ask because-- I mean,
in rehab we Iearned aII about...

785
00:38:58,884 --> 00:39:02,841
facing your fears
and chasing them down.

786
00:39:02,886 --> 00:39:05,877
My greatest fear is that
I can't act anymore

787
00:39:05,921 --> 00:39:08,388
and no one wouId care.

788
00:39:08,423 --> 00:39:10,754
And then it happened.

789
00:39:10,791 --> 00:39:14,054
Just because you're not acting
doesn't make you irreIevant.

790
00:39:14,092 --> 00:39:16,855
Not according to the principaI

791
00:39:16,894 --> 00:39:18,986
or to my mother
or apparentIy to Sam.

792
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:23,698
I just don't think
I can do anything eIse.

793
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:28,167
Listen, I know it doesn't feeI
Iike it right this second,

794
00:39:28,201 --> 00:39:30,794
but you have onIy Iived

795
00:39:30,836 --> 00:39:32,496
a very smaII sIiver
of your Iife.

796
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:33,765
WeII, Iook who's taIking.

797
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:36,363
Come on, when I was your age I wanted
everything right then and there.

798
00:39:36,405 --> 00:39:37,894
I was racing
toward that finish Iine

799
00:39:37,939 --> 00:39:39,997
and I ended up
messing it aII up.

800
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,769
- You're 17.
- What does that mean?

801
00:39:42,809 --> 00:39:44,935
- It means be 17 for a IittIe whiIe.
- Oh!

802

( doorbeII rings )

803
00:39:46,945 --> 00:39:49,071

( Trudy chuckIes )
Oh, hi, come on in.

805
00:39:52,082 --> 00:39:54,072
CIaudia!

00:39:56,751 --> 00:39:58,877
Hi.

807
00:39:58,919 --> 00:40:01,853
Hey, EmiIy,
what are you doing here?

808
00:40:01,888 --> 00:40:05,049
I wanted to make sure you'd recovered
from the attack of the Amazon woman.

809
00:40:05,089 --> 00:40:06,282
Are you okay?

out of ''7th Heaven'' or something.

811
00:40:08,925 --> 00:40:12,188
She acted Iike she reaIIy cared,
which confused me.

812
00:40:12,226 --> 00:40:14,318
EmiIy, nice to meet you.
Don't be a stranger.

813
00:40:14,361 --> 00:40:16,386
Okay.

814
00:40:16,429 --> 00:40:19,226
I aIso wanted to invite you
to my sIeepover on Friday.

815
00:40:19,265 --> 00:40:22,232
That's reaIIy sweet.

816
00:40:23,901 --> 00:40:27,266
SIeepovers aren't reaIIy
my thing, though, but thank you.

817
00:40:27,302 --> 00:40:28,893
Sometimes I get the feeIing

818
00:40:28,936 --> 00:40:30,300
that you don't reaIIy
wanna be my friend.

819
00:40:30,336 --> 00:40:33,827
It's not true. I just--

820
00:40:33,872 --> 00:40:35,839
I have a hard time
trusting peopIe.

821
00:40:35,873 --> 00:40:37,897
Don't teII anyone,
but my best friend from my oId schooI,

822
00:40:37,941 --> 00:40:41,376
she stoIe a bunch of SAT questions
and then she bIamed it on me.

823
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:43,070
Oh my God.
Did you get expeIIed?

824
00:40:43,111 --> 00:40:46,408
Let's just say it's a big part
of the reason I'm here.

825
00:40:48,481 --> 00:40:52,415
WeII, I won't teII anyone.
Pinkie promise.

826
00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:55,940
Thank you.

827
00:40:55,985 --> 00:40:59,248
Anyway, think about the party.
It'II be a reaIIy cooI time.

828
00:40:59,287 --> 00:41:02,119
I wiII. I wiII think about it.

829
00:41:03,355 --> 00:41:06,653
EmiIy, you know what?
I thought about it,

830
00:41:06,691 --> 00:41:09,888
and it sounds Iike it'II be fun,
you know, whatever.

831
00:41:09,928 --> 00:41:12,293
- Let's give it a shot.
- Yes!

832
00:41:13,362 --> 00:41:15,056
We're gonna have
so much fun.

833
00:41:15,096 --> 00:41:16,494
Yes, it'II be great.

834
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:18,520
- Bye.
- Bye.

835
00:41:27,369 --> 00:41:29,336
Morgan's voice:
My first sIeepover.

836
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:32,101
Strike that.
My first unscripted one.

837
00:41:32,141 --> 00:41:34,630
( doorbeII rings )

838
00:41:35,709 --> 00:41:38,404
- Hi!
- Hey!

839
00:41:38,444 --> 00:41:40,740
We just turned
Bethany's hair bIue.

840
00:41:40,778 --> 00:41:43,746
Morgan: Not exactIy the kind of girIs
I wouId have hung with at home.

841
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:46,645
I mean, I used to party
with princesses,

842
00:41:46,681 --> 00:41:49,581
actuaI princesses.

843
00:41:49,616 --> 00:41:53,051
I can't beIieve I Iet Trudy
taIk me into this.

844
00:41:53,085 --> 00:41:55,917
It couId be worse.
I bet I'd have more fun chaperoning

845
00:41:55,954 --> 00:41:59,286
her hot date watering begonias
or whatever it is she does.

846
00:42:04,192 --> 00:42:07,455
If Trudy spent as much time
around peopIe as she did pIants,

847
00:42:07,493 --> 00:42:09,687
maybe she'd have a date
with a reaI Iive human once in a whiIe.

848
00:42:09,728 --> 00:42:12,752
Oh.

849
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:14,093
Truth or dare?

850
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:17,291
What's the furthest you've gone
with a guy? Debbie.

851
00:42:17,332 --> 00:42:20,391
Second.

852
00:42:20,434 --> 00:42:23,299
- Okay, maybe third base.
- EmiIy: What?

853
00:42:23,335 --> 00:42:26,668
Wait. What do you mean maybe?
Don't you know?

854
00:42:26,705 --> 00:42:29,001
I onIy answer
one question per turn.

855
00:42:29,038 --> 00:42:30,596
So truth or dare?

856
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,369
Truth.

857
00:42:32,408 --> 00:42:34,773
Okay, is it true you got kicked out
of your oId schooI

858
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:38,300
for doing your boyfriend
in the cafeteria?

859
00:42:38,345 --> 00:42:39,641
Debbie.

860
00:42:39,678 --> 00:42:42,339
No. Who toId you that?

861
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:44,972
It's a hot rumor.
I heard it, too.

862
00:42:45,014 --> 00:42:47,504
So then why did you
get kicked out?

863
00:42:47,549 --> 00:42:50,382
I onIy answer
one question per turn.

864
00:42:50,418 --> 00:42:53,113
I dare you to teII everyone
who you have a crush on at schooI.

865
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:55,780
At HiIIhaven?
I don't have a crush on anyone.

866
00:42:55,822 --> 00:42:57,379
ReaIIy? No one?

867
00:42:57,422 --> 00:42:59,412
Morgan:
This girI was starting to bug.

868
00:42:59,457 --> 00:43:03,050
- Liar.
- My instinct was to pounce on her.

869
00:43:03,092 --> 00:43:05,059
Instead, I unfortunateIy said...

870
00:43:05,093 --> 00:43:07,686
Besides,
I aIready have a boyfriend.

871
00:43:07,728 --> 00:43:10,195
GirIs: You do?

872
00:43:10,229 --> 00:43:12,493
Morgan:
Crap, why did I say that?

873
00:43:12,531 --> 00:43:14,794
You're Iying.
What's his name?

874
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:17,562
Evan WaIsh.

875
00:43:17,601 --> 00:43:21,194
- ( Iaughing )
- Evan WaIsh, the actor?

876
00:43:21,236 --> 00:43:23,226
Morgan:
Why couIdn't I say ''Joe Smith''?

877
00:43:23,271 --> 00:43:25,238
Joe Smith was
the obvious answer.

878
00:43:25,272 --> 00:43:28,240
No, they have the same name, but they're
obviousIy not the same person.

879
00:43:28,274 --> 00:43:30,241
- Both: Yeah.
- I didn't think so.

880
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:32,504
I mean,
you dating Evan WaIsh,

881
00:43:32,542 --> 00:43:36,238
the actor. That's funny.

882
00:43:37,612 --> 00:43:40,409
- EIi.
- Oh! Hey, EIi.

883
00:43:40,447 --> 00:43:42,244
Hey, Debbie, Bethany.

884
00:43:42,283 --> 00:43:44,876
- EmiIy: GirIs' night.
- Hey, CIaudia.

885
00:43:44,917 --> 00:43:46,611
Hi.

886
00:43:46,652 --> 00:43:49,949
And suddenIy, aII became cIear
in Debbie's tiny IittIe worId.

887
00:43:49,986 --> 00:43:51,714
She crushed on EIi,

888
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,914
and she worried
about the new girI-- me--

889
00:43:53,955 --> 00:43:56,252
riding off
into the sunset with him.

890
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:58,052
Okay, who wants
to watch a movie?

891
00:43:58,090 --> 00:43:59,954
- Me.
- Morgan's voice: Anything to end

892
00:43:59,991 --> 00:44:02,982
the Spanish
Fort Wayne Inquisition.

893
00:44:03,027 --> 00:44:06,427
Okay, we've got ''Go Panthers,''
''Bring It On,'' ''LegaIIy BIonde''

894
00:44:06,462 --> 00:44:08,395
and ''GirIs on Top.''

895
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:10,260
Morgan:
And there it was, with my face

896
00:44:10,298 --> 00:44:13,459
Taking up exactly 33%
of the DVD cover

897
00:44:13,499 --> 00:44:16,764
Yes, exactly 33%.
It was in my contract

898
00:44:17,835 --> 00:44:19,495
Let's watch ''Go Panthers.''

899
00:44:19,536 --> 00:44:21,401
Isn't that the girI that ODed--
Megan Carter?

900
00:44:21,438 --> 00:44:23,563
Morgan Carter.
Yeah, that's her.

901
00:44:23,605 --> 00:44:26,437
Let's watch ''LegaIIy BIonde.''
That's one of my favorite movies.

902
00:44:26,473 --> 00:44:28,167
Yeah, and who gets impIants at 1 3?

903
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,730
Debbie: Yeah, I mean,
and she can't even act.

904
00:44:29,775 --> 00:44:32,073
I mean, I'm a better actress
than she is.

905
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:33,872
WeII, I think she's reaIIy good.

906
00:44:33,911 --> 00:44:36,038
If she's so great,
then why was she hooked on heroin?

907
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,513
It wasn't heroin!
It was aIcohoI.

908
00:44:40,082 --> 00:44:42,208
I read somewhere.

909
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:44,444
Hey, CIaudia,
you kind of Iook Iike her.

910
00:44:44,484 --> 00:44:46,917
Morgan:
Not now, pIease not now.

911
00:44:46,952 --> 00:44:49,613
I don't think so.
Morgan's a bIonde.

912
00:44:49,654 --> 00:44:51,211
Yeah.

913
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:53,347
And not to mention,
she's twice the bra size.

914
00:44:53,389 --> 00:44:56,380
And aIso she's way skinnier.
No offense, CIaudia.

915
00:44:56,425 --> 00:44:58,916
None taken.

916
00:45:00,628 --> 00:45:03,095
Where's your bathroom?

917
00:45:03,129 --> 00:45:06,153
Morgan's voice: Okay, so I had
gained some weight in rehab

918
00:45:06,197 --> 00:45:07,959
and at Trudy's.

919
00:45:07,998 --> 00:45:09,363
No.

920
00:45:09,399 --> 00:45:13,094
But had I Iost my breasts?
What the heII was going on?

921
00:45:13,134 --> 00:45:15,567
Was I stiII Morgan
or was I reaIIy CIaudia?

922
00:45:24,608 --> 00:45:26,575
You don't have
a cigarette, do you?

923
00:45:26,609 --> 00:45:28,439
Forget cigarettes.

924
00:45:28,477 --> 00:45:31,468
I don't get you,
'cause you seem to Iike it here.

925
00:45:31,512 --> 00:45:34,502
I mean,
you seem to be okay.

926
00:45:34,547 --> 00:45:36,070
As opposed to...?

927
00:45:36,114 --> 00:45:38,377
Tearing down the waIIs,
drinking tiII you faII over.

928
00:45:38,415 --> 00:45:41,110
I think you want the guys
who hang out behind the 7-11.

929
00:45:45,853 --> 00:45:48,979
Look up.

930
00:45:49,021 --> 00:45:51,114
What do you see?

931
00:45:51,156 --> 00:45:52,486
Nothing.

932
00:45:52,523 --> 00:45:54,717
EIi: The sky.

933
00:45:54,758 --> 00:45:58,386
I went to New York one time.
I Iooked up...

934
00:45:58,427 --> 00:46:00,326
and I saw buiIdings.

935
00:46:00,362 --> 00:46:02,329
The sky was crowded.

936
00:46:03,697 --> 00:46:05,288
I don't know.
I Iike it here.

937
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,589
I never Iook up.

938
00:46:12,968 --> 00:46:16,062
See those IittIe dots up there?
CaIIed stars.

939
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:20,007
Heard you got sent
to the principaI's office.

940
00:46:20,041 --> 00:46:21,667
Yeah.

941
00:46:21,708 --> 00:46:24,300
EIi: Hey, maybe we can start
that tutoring we taIked about.

942
00:46:24,342 --> 00:46:26,400
That's a great idea.

943
00:46:26,443 --> 00:46:29,070
What's a great idea?

944
00:46:29,112 --> 00:46:31,875
EIi:
Tutoring CIaudia.

945
00:46:31,913 --> 00:46:33,903
Oh, reaIIy?

946
00:46:33,948 --> 00:46:35,812
Yeah.

947
00:46:35,849 --> 00:46:39,443
Tomorrow. Try not to tear down
any waIIs in the meantime.

948
00:46:39,485 --> 00:46:41,510
Okay.

949
00:46:44,888 --> 00:46:46,855
Here's the thing, CIaudia:

950
00:46:46,889 --> 00:46:50,016
I Iike EIi, and we've been friends
for a very Iong time,

951
00:46:50,058 --> 00:46:51,786
and it's going to
the next IeveI.

952
00:46:51,825 --> 00:46:54,088
The next Iev--

953
00:46:54,127 --> 00:46:56,390
does he know that?

954
00:46:56,427 --> 00:46:58,918
I'm serious.
Stay away from him.

955
00:46:58,963 --> 00:47:01,294
Morgan's voice:
It was such cIiched diaIogue,

956
00:47:01,331 --> 00:47:03,491
I couIdn't beIieve
it was stiII being used.

957
00:47:03,532 --> 00:47:06,227
I'm serious.
Find somebody eIse to pIay with,

958
00:47:06,267 --> 00:47:08,996
or maybe you shouId go caII
your fake boyfriend.

959
00:47:10,303 --> 00:47:13,202
Anything to get away
from you, freak girI.

960
00:47:16,507 --> 00:47:19,303
( phone beeping )

961
00:47:19,341 --> 00:47:21,069
( rings )

962
00:47:21,108 --> 00:47:23,837
Bianca's voice: This is Bianca.
You know what to do.

963
00:47:23,877 --> 00:47:26,605
- ( beep )
- Pick up. Pick up.

964
00:47:26,644 --> 00:47:29,510
Just pick up,
pick up, pick up.

965
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:31,274
- Pick up.
- ( beep )

966
00:47:31,313 --> 00:47:32,974
Sam: HeIIo.

967
00:47:33,015 --> 00:47:36,211
I'm Iooking for Bianca Carter.
Who is this?

968
00:47:36,251 --> 00:47:39,150
Sam:
This is her husband. Who's this?

969
00:47:40,853 --> 00:47:43,343
Husband?
This is her daughter.

970
00:47:43,388 --> 00:47:46,288
Oh my God.

971
00:47:46,323 --> 00:47:48,552
Oh God, oh God, oh God.

972
00:47:48,591 --> 00:47:50,955
Sam?

973
00:47:50,992 --> 00:47:54,449
Is that you?
Sam! Sam!

974
00:47:54,494 --> 00:47:57,792
Sam, Sam, Sam,
taIk to me.

975
00:47:57,830 --> 00:47:59,888
What is-- what is going on?

976
00:47:59,931 --> 00:48:01,296
Sam, Sam, Sam!

977
00:48:01,332 --> 00:48:04,027
Morgan... honey.

978
00:48:04,067 --> 00:48:07,660
Did you get married?
Did you marry Sam?

979
00:48:07,702 --> 00:48:09,862
Okay, caIm down, Morgan.

980
00:48:09,904 --> 00:48:12,303
You got married
without even teIIing me.

981
00:48:12,338 --> 00:48:14,328
When did this happen?

982
00:48:14,373 --> 00:48:16,363
Bianca: Last week.
We didn't want to teII you

983
00:48:16,407 --> 00:48:18,533
because we didn't want
to mess with your recovery.

984
00:48:18,575 --> 00:48:21,134
You're making this about me?
How dare you?

985
00:48:21,177 --> 00:48:24,476
- This has nothing to do with me!
- HoId on. Sam wants to taIk to you.

986
00:48:24,513 --> 00:48:27,412
She's yeIIing at me.
DeaI with her.

987
00:48:27,448 --> 00:48:29,472
Morgan sweetheart,
don't be angry with us,

988
00:48:29,515 --> 00:48:31,209
because we didn't mean
to faII in Iove.

989
00:48:31,249 --> 00:48:33,045
- We just-- it just happened.
- Sam, this--

990
00:48:33,083 --> 00:48:35,209
- this is buII!
- ( phone thuds )

991
00:48:35,251 --> 00:48:38,344
Morgan: Sam didn't ship me off
to Fort Lame because he cared about me.

992
00:48:38,387 --> 00:48:40,718
He did it so he couId marry
my spoiIed brat of a mother

993
00:48:40,755 --> 00:48:42,655
without me knowing.

994
00:48:46,058 --> 00:48:48,048
( phone rings )

995
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:50,993
Is it possibIe that Sam had
actuaIIy faIIen in Iove with her?

996
00:48:51,029 --> 00:48:54,155
Face down

997
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:56,323
One hand tied
to the anchor

998
00:48:56,364 --> 00:48:59,160
And we're reaching
for the sky

999
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:00,928
Hope we don't drown

1000
00:49:00,967 --> 00:49:03,763
Don't drown

1001
00:49:05,069 --> 00:49:07,059
Do I reaIIy wanna...

1002
00:49:07,103 --> 00:49:10,832
Morgan: Truth is,
I had been expeIIed from their Iives.

1003
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:14,236
( ringing )

1004
00:49:14,273 --> 00:49:17,174
I've seen too many birds
shot down

1005
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:19,335
Too many birds shot down

1006
00:49:19,376 --> 00:49:21,241
Too many birds...

1007
00:49:21,278 --> 00:49:23,438
Morgan's voice:
And now I was totaIIy,

1008
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:26,073
utterIy aIone.

1009
00:49:26,114 --> 00:49:28,980
-  HoId on, there's a storm coming...
- ( phone crashes )

1010
00:49:29,016 --> 00:49:31,676
Stay face down

1011
00:49:31,717 --> 00:49:33,911
Face down.

1012
00:49:41,057 --> 00:49:43,854
Morgan, why'd you skip
the sIeepover?

1013
00:49:48,928 --> 00:49:50,121
Morgan.

1014
00:49:51,296 --> 00:49:54,855
Morgan, honey. Morgan.

1015
00:49:54,898 --> 00:49:58,093
Trudy, hey.

1016
00:49:58,132 --> 00:50:00,622
You scared the heII out of me.

1017
00:50:04,937 --> 00:50:07,996
Yeah, weII,
sorry about that.

1018
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:10,097
You wanna teII me what the heII
this is about?

1019
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:12,869
You we're the diversion.

1020
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:16,434
Just keep her busy,
go off and get married,

1021
00:50:16,477 --> 00:50:20,241
and I'm supposed
to be the actress, you know?

1022
00:50:20,279 --> 00:50:22,246
But you're reaIIy good.

1023
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:25,647
What? What are you teIIing me?
Your mom got married?

1024
00:50:25,682 --> 00:50:28,241
To Sam.
They toId me Iast night.

1025
00:50:31,586 --> 00:50:34,315
- I didn't know anything about it.
- Right.

1026
00:50:34,355 --> 00:50:38,221
- I have no reason to Iie to you.
- WeII, that'd be a first.

1027
00:50:38,257 --> 00:50:40,451
WeII, congratuIations.

1028
00:50:40,491 --> 00:50:42,321
You finaIIy did it.

1029
00:50:42,359 --> 00:50:45,452
You were just Iooking for an excuse
to drink and you found it.

1030
00:50:48,495 --> 00:50:50,758
You have no idea
what I've just been through.

1031
00:50:50,796 --> 00:50:53,559
ReaIIy? ReaIIy?
WeII, I'II teII you what I do know.

1032
00:50:53,598 --> 00:50:55,121
You have been wandering
around here

1033
00:50:55,165 --> 00:50:58,497
Iike this is some great big joke waiting
for HoIIywood Sam to come rescue you,

1034
00:50:58,535 --> 00:51:01,264
but that's not
gonna happen now, is it?

1035
00:51:01,303 --> 00:51:04,930
Okay, decision time, CIaudia, Morgan,
whoever the heII you wanna be!

1036
00:51:04,971 --> 00:51:06,598
Which is it?
Which character?

1037
00:51:07,807 --> 00:51:11,241
What do you,
for reaI, actuaIIy care about?

1038
00:51:15,444 --> 00:51:17,434
- ( retching )
- ( water running )

1039
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,143
Morgan:
What do I care about?

1040
00:51:23,181 --> 00:51:26,207
- What do I care about?
- ( doorbeII rings )

1041
00:51:26,251 --> 00:51:28,275
Morgan:
Okay, no, that has to stop.

1042
00:51:32,922 --> 00:51:35,481
( doorbeII ringing )

1043
00:51:35,523 --> 00:51:37,581
Morgan:
SeriousIy, stop.

1044
00:51:37,624 --> 00:51:40,557
( doorbeII continues ringing )

1045
00:51:40,592 --> 00:51:42,855
( ringing stops )

1046
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:50,198
- Morgan: Better.
- ( knocking )

1047
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:52,358
Or not.

1048
00:51:55,702 --> 00:51:57,692
PIease make me evaporate.

1049
00:52:05,106 --> 00:52:06,834
Hey.

1050
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:09,775
Cut out on my sister's party.
She's pretty twisted about it.

1051
00:52:11,411 --> 00:52:13,344
You Iook Iike crap.

1052
00:52:13,378 --> 00:52:15,846
Aren't you a big ray of sunshine?

1053
00:52:17,381 --> 00:52:20,042
- What's wrong with you?
- Pick a category.

1054
00:52:22,984 --> 00:52:24,281
Oh.

1055
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:26,444
Got it.

1056
00:52:26,485 --> 00:52:28,009
EIi, EIi, wait.

1057
00:52:28,054 --> 00:52:29,714
PIease.

1058
00:52:35,324 --> 00:52:38,190
There's a Iot that
you don't know about me.

1059
00:52:40,327 --> 00:52:43,022
I toId everyone that I moved here
to make a fresh start,

1060
00:52:43,062 --> 00:52:46,053
but that's reaIIy onIy part
of the story.

1061
00:52:46,097 --> 00:52:48,621
Okay.

1062
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:51,428
Listen, if I teII you something,
you have to promise not to teII anyone,

1063
00:52:51,467 --> 00:52:53,866
not even EmiIy.

1064
00:52:53,902 --> 00:52:56,630
Okay, try me.

1065
00:53:00,905 --> 00:53:03,771
I'm here because I--

1066
00:53:03,807 --> 00:53:05,899
because I'm in hiding.

1067
00:53:05,941 --> 00:53:07,966
- Hiding?
- Sort of.

1068
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:10,001
From what?

1069
00:53:15,615 --> 00:53:17,081
My father's crazy.

1070
00:53:17,115 --> 00:53:21,049
He's reaIIy crazy,
and he gets very vioIent.

1071
00:53:21,084 --> 00:53:23,051
He used to hit me
and my mom.

1072
00:53:23,085 --> 00:53:25,552
What?

1073
00:53:25,586 --> 00:53:28,815
Morgan's voice:
I just couIdn't chance it.

1074
00:53:28,854 --> 00:53:32,291
So instead, I borrowed the pIot
from my Lifetime movie

1075
00:53:32,325 --> 00:53:34,554
''My Father, My Stranger.''

1076
00:53:34,593 --> 00:53:36,389
One time he broke my nose.

1077
00:53:36,427 --> 00:53:37,984
- What?
- My mom Ieft him,

1078
00:53:38,028 --> 00:53:39,858
and the judge gave her
fuII custody,

1079
00:53:39,895 --> 00:53:43,590
but then he faked his own death
and he started foIIowing me around

1080
00:53:43,631 --> 00:53:45,689
in a disguise.
He's changed his name and everything.

1081
00:53:45,732 --> 00:53:47,995
My mom caught on to this,
of course, but then,

1082
00:53:48,033 --> 00:53:51,229
she got a rare bIood disease, and she
wasn't abIe to care for us anymore.

1083
00:53:51,268 --> 00:53:53,735
She wasn't even abIe to keep
herseIf safe, Iet aIone me,

1084
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:57,204
so she thought the safest pIace for me
to be was right here with my aunt.

1085
00:53:57,238 --> 00:53:59,706
I thought stuff Iike that
onIy happened on TV.

1086
00:53:59,741 --> 00:54:01,332
Anyway,

1087
00:54:01,375 --> 00:54:03,706
that's why I'm so upset,

1088
00:54:03,743 --> 00:54:05,642
'cause I'm reaIIy afraid
that he might find me,

1089
00:54:05,677 --> 00:54:07,439
and he can't know
where I am.

1090
00:54:07,478 --> 00:54:09,240
He can never find me...

1091
00:54:09,278 --> 00:54:11,211
Morgan's voice:
And then I started to cry--

1092
00:54:11,246 --> 00:54:14,681
partIy because the roIe required it,
but I aIso feIt reaIIy terribIe

1093
00:54:14,715 --> 00:54:16,648
about Iying to EIi.

1094
00:54:16,683 --> 00:54:18,877
CouId you just forget
I ever said anything?

1095
00:54:18,917 --> 00:54:20,975
No. No, I wiII not forget, okay?

1096
00:54:21,019 --> 00:54:23,383
You see him, you caII me.

1097
00:54:23,419 --> 00:54:25,410
AII right?

1098
00:54:25,454 --> 00:54:27,853
In the meantime, Iet's get
your head into something eIse.

1099
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:30,288
How about some geometry?

1100
00:54:30,324 --> 00:54:32,258
Yeah.

1101
00:54:32,292 --> 00:54:34,953
This is more boring
than baking.

1102
00:54:34,994 --> 00:54:36,483
Try it.

1103
00:54:38,663 --> 00:54:40,653
Is that right?

1104
00:54:43,165 --> 00:54:46,291
Yeah, that's aII it is
right there.

1105
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:50,364
- ReaIIy?
- Yeah.

1106
00:54:52,271 --> 00:54:54,238
Okay, weII,
Iet's try another one.

1107
00:54:54,272 --> 00:54:56,466
- AII right, here, try this.
- AII right.

1108
00:55:00,242 --> 00:55:02,232
You wanna go out
this weekend?

1109
00:55:04,978 --> 00:55:06,968
What, Iike on a date?

1110
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:09,444
Undefined.

1111
00:55:09,479 --> 00:55:12,276
Yes.

1112
00:55:13,549 --> 00:55:15,540
AII right.

1113
00:55:18,586 --> 00:55:19,984
Morgan:
I'm not totaIIy sure of this,

1114
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:22,453
because most of my reIationships
have either been scripted

1115
00:55:22,488 --> 00:55:24,284
or happened
whiIe I was drunk,

1116
00:55:24,322 --> 00:55:26,983
but I maybe
might have a thing

1117
00:55:27,024 --> 00:55:29,014
for EIi WiIIs.

1118
00:55:31,126 --> 00:55:33,094
Are you dating my brother?

1119
00:55:33,128 --> 00:55:36,653
I don't know.

1120
00:55:36,697 --> 00:55:39,960
Okay, so Iet's try this one.

1121
00:55:39,998 --> 00:55:42,466
Do you have
a boyfriend in New York?

1122
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:45,559
Not anymore.
We broke up.

1123
00:55:45,601 --> 00:55:47,569
I think he Iikes guys.

1124
00:55:47,602 --> 00:55:49,967
So the other night was a Iie?

1125
00:55:50,004 --> 00:55:52,369
Or are you Iying to me now?

1126
00:55:52,405 --> 00:55:54,395
Morgan:
I'm Iying to everyone

1127
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:56,771
aII the time, and it sucks.

1128
00:55:56,808 --> 00:56:00,105
So do you Iike my brother?

1129
00:56:00,142 --> 00:56:02,200
I guess so.

1130
00:56:03,244 --> 00:56:04,505
Yes, I do.

1131
00:56:04,545 --> 00:56:06,570
WeII, then don't Iie to him

1132
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:09,604
or to me ever again.

1133
00:56:30,693 --> 00:56:33,787
I don't know how much Ionger
I can keep Iying to peopIe,

1134
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:35,457
especiaIIy EIi.

1135
00:56:35,498 --> 00:56:38,431
And I am not smart enough
to keep track of who I said what to.

1136
00:56:38,466 --> 00:56:41,491
I mean,
maybe I shouId make a chart

1137
00:56:41,534 --> 00:56:43,797
just so I can
keep things straight.

1138
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:48,870
Are you going
on a date or something?

1139
00:56:48,904 --> 00:56:51,269
What?

1140
00:56:51,306 --> 00:56:53,273
- No.
- Yea--

1141
00:56:53,307 --> 00:56:55,639
Iook at you.
You're aII dressed up and your hair.

1142
00:56:55,676 --> 00:56:58,667
( doorbeII rings )

1143
00:56:58,711 --> 00:57:00,678
You're going on a date!
It's him right now, isn't it?

1144
00:57:00,712 --> 00:57:03,339
I'm gonna go get it.

1145
00:57:07,716 --> 00:57:10,683
- Oh my God! Marissa!
- ( screaming )

1146
00:57:10,717 --> 00:57:13,879
Oh my God!
I can't beIieve you're here!

1147
00:57:13,919 --> 00:57:15,887
I can't beIieve this is
where they stuck you.

1148
00:57:15,921 --> 00:57:18,717
I've never seen
your reaI hair before. It's different.

1149
00:57:18,756 --> 00:57:21,553
- You knew about this.
- Sam and Bianca trying to pIay nice.

1150
00:57:21,591 --> 00:57:23,456
They did pass it
through your rehab counseIor.

1151
00:57:23,493 --> 00:57:26,255
- Hi, Marissa. I'II take your bag.
- Thank you.

1152
00:57:27,828 --> 00:57:30,022
Oh. Oh. Oh my God.

1153
00:57:30,063 --> 00:57:32,894
Okay, Iook at this pIace.

1154
00:57:32,930 --> 00:57:35,727
SeriousIy, it's Iike
HeIIo Kitty threw up in here.

1155
00:57:35,766 --> 00:57:39,029
Be nice. Be nice.
Trudy's been reaIIy good to me.

1156
00:57:39,067 --> 00:57:40,556
So?

1157
00:57:40,601 --> 00:57:43,262
How are you, girIfriend?

1158
00:57:43,302 --> 00:57:46,134
- In need of a best friend.
- WeII, I have arrived.

1159
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:48,603
And the costume peopIe
from my new movie totaIIy hooked me up,

1160
00:57:48,638 --> 00:57:51,607
so we can go out
and no one wiII know it's me.

1161
00:57:51,641 --> 00:57:55,131
And I wanna try out
my new accent.

1162
00:57:55,176 --> 00:57:56,642
- Accent?
- Mm-hmm.

1163
00:57:57,912 --> 00:57:59,902
( Marissa with Southern accent )
Sugar, I feeI Iike we got transported

1164
00:57:59,946 --> 00:58:02,913
to the set
of ''Ozzie and Harriet.''

1165
00:58:02,947 --> 00:58:04,971
Morgan:
Her accent was driving me crazy.

1166
00:58:05,015 --> 00:58:08,881
Marissa sounded Iike ''Fargo''
meets Jessica Simpson.

1167
00:58:08,917 --> 00:58:11,476
You get used to it.
I Iike to hear the birds.

1168
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:13,315
Ooh, Iet's get some ice cream.

1169
00:58:16,622 --> 00:58:19,182
HeIIo, can I have some vaniIIa
in a cup, pIease?

1170
00:58:19,224 --> 00:58:20,952
And what do you want?

1171
00:58:20,992 --> 00:58:23,824
Do you have any
nonfat sugar-free tofu?

1172
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:26,259
Yeah, honey,
this is an ice cream truck, aII right?

1173
00:58:28,662 --> 00:58:30,493
Thanks.

1174
00:58:34,299 --> 00:58:35,822
What?

1175
00:58:35,866 --> 00:58:37,492
It's just-- wow.

1176
00:58:37,534 --> 00:58:40,595
I mean, why didn't you
just order a big side of fat?

1177
00:58:40,637 --> 00:58:42,195
I Iike ice cream.

1178
00:58:42,238 --> 00:58:45,000
So do I, but--
okay, I'm sorry.

1179
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:47,404
But do you ever pIan
on working again?

1180
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,498
Of course I do.
That's why I'm here, remember?

1181
00:58:49,542 --> 00:58:51,099
This pIace is a joke, Morgan.

1182
00:58:51,142 --> 00:58:53,109
You'd have been better off
hiring a personaI trainer

1183
00:58:53,143 --> 00:58:56,339
and doing off-Broadway.

1184
00:58:56,379 --> 00:58:59,279
Marissa, you don't have the vaguest idea
of what I've been through.

1185
00:58:59,314 --> 00:59:01,008
You didn't even visit me
in rehab.

1186
00:59:01,048 --> 00:59:03,607
I mean, one day I was
your favorite party girI

1187
00:59:03,650 --> 00:59:05,708
and the next day
I aImost died.

1188
00:59:05,751 --> 00:59:08,720
And you couIdn't handIe that,
and you just cut me Ioose.

1189
00:59:08,754 --> 00:59:10,550
Why?

1190
00:59:11,988 --> 00:59:14,547
Look, watching you that night

1191
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:16,557
at the cIub,

1192
00:59:16,591 --> 00:59:18,649
I was aImost as high
as you were.

1193
00:59:18,692 --> 00:59:21,386
Okay, it couId have been me.

1194
00:59:21,426 --> 00:59:23,893
I know I shouId
have visited you in rehab.

1195
00:59:23,928 --> 00:59:26,122
I just feIt guiIty.

1196
00:59:26,162 --> 00:59:29,789
So guiIty,
but I am reaIIy reaIIy sorry.

1197
00:59:29,831 --> 00:59:33,061
( car horn honks )

1198
00:59:34,267 --> 00:59:36,461
Crap.
Remember, I'm CIaudia.

1199
00:59:36,502 --> 00:59:37,900
Okay.

1200
00:59:37,936 --> 00:59:39,596
- EmiIy: Hi.
- Hey, guys.

1201
00:59:39,636 --> 00:59:42,264
EIi, EmiIy,
this is my friend from back home...

1202
00:59:42,306 --> 00:59:44,170
Morgan's voice: Insert fake name.
Insert fake name!

1203
00:59:44,207 --> 00:59:47,231
Daisy Du-- chovny.

1204
00:59:47,274 --> 00:59:50,470
- Daisy Duchovny.
- Like the guy from ''X-FiIes''?

1205
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:52,875
No reIation. Too bad.

1206
00:59:54,011 --> 00:59:56,308
When do you want me
to pick you up on Saturday?

1207
00:59:56,346 --> 00:59:57,607
I'II caII you.

1208
00:59:57,646 --> 00:59:59,978
CooI. AII right, weII,
good meeting you.

1209
01:00:00,015 --> 01:00:01,482
- Nice meeting you.
- Morgan: Thanks, guys.

1210
01:00:01,517 --> 01:00:03,916
Marissa:
See you aII Iater.

1211
01:00:03,952 --> 01:00:07,147
Oh my God.
You are going on a date with BiIIy Joe.

1212
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:10,154
His name is EIi,
and-- we're just friends.

1213
01:00:10,188 --> 01:00:13,622
Okay okay, yeah, we have to
get you out of this town.

1214
01:00:13,656 --> 01:00:17,351
I bought you a reaIIy
gorgeous dress for tonight.

1215
01:00:17,391 --> 01:00:19,449
- What's tonight?
- We're making magic.

1216
01:00:19,492 --> 01:00:21,221
Oh.

1217
01:00:27,966 --> 01:00:29,933
Maybe we shouIdn't be here.
Someone's gonna see us.

1218
01:00:29,967 --> 01:00:32,161
It's Chicago. Who do you
think we're gonna run into?

1219
01:00:32,201 --> 01:00:34,532
No using your reaI name.
No VIP treatment here.

1220
01:00:34,569 --> 01:00:36,968
I have never paid
a cover in my Iife.

1221
01:00:43,808 --> 01:00:45,798
I've actuaIIy cut way back
on my drinking.

1222
01:00:45,842 --> 01:00:47,672
Good.

1223
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:49,678
Excuse me.

1224
01:00:49,712 --> 01:00:52,646
Hey, Iadies. I'm CarIos.
What can I get for you?

1225
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:54,112
Something pretty?

1226
01:00:54,147 --> 01:00:56,239
A Manhattan, two cherries.

1227
01:00:56,282 --> 01:00:59,079
I think I read your mind.
And for you?

1228
01:00:59,117 --> 01:01:02,107
Um...

1229
01:01:02,151 --> 01:01:03,583
cIub soda with a Iime.

1230
01:01:03,619 --> 01:01:05,677
Are you sure you don't want
something pretty Iike your friend?

1231
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:07,812
No, thank you.

1232
01:01:07,854 --> 01:01:09,616
Good for you. Idea:

1233
01:01:09,655 --> 01:01:11,350
FIy home with me,
move in with me

1234
01:01:11,390 --> 01:01:13,788
and we forget the whoIe
nightmare ever happened.

1235
01:01:13,824 --> 01:01:17,589
Morgan: Go back, resume, forget.
It sounded good to Morgan.

1236
01:01:17,627 --> 01:01:20,424
Hey, another one.

1237
01:01:20,462 --> 01:01:21,985
Morgan:
But CIaudia was Iess sure.

1238
01:01:22,029 --> 01:01:23,497
CIaudia had Trudy and EmiIy,

1239
01:01:23,531 --> 01:01:26,362
and CIaudia had
an undefined date with EIi.

1240
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:28,798
- ( dance music pIaying )
- Let's go, baby!

1241
01:01:28,834 --> 01:01:31,324
Whoo!

1242
01:01:32,502 --> 01:01:35,629
Marissa: Whoo! Yeah!

1243
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:37,796
One shot for you, baby.

1244
01:01:40,039 --> 01:01:43,237
Morgan: For a moment,
it was reaIIy Iike oId times.

1245
01:01:43,277 --> 01:01:46,005
Marissa and I were invincibIe.
Nothing couId touch us.

1246
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:49,208
Hey, CarIos, one more.

1247
01:01:56,416 --> 01:01:58,508
Here you go, sweet thing.

1248
01:01:59,718 --> 01:02:02,184
Hey, remember when we used
to dance on the bar at Jade?

1249
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:05,211
We changed our bras
in front of, Iike, everyone.

1250
01:02:05,255 --> 01:02:08,314
Is it just me or are our best times
when we were smashed?

1251
01:02:08,357 --> 01:02:11,189
ReIax, okay?
Loosen up. Come on!

1252
01:02:11,226 --> 01:02:14,716
Watch this.
Excuse me, boys.

1253
01:02:15,728 --> 01:02:17,786
Go, baby! Whoo!

1254
01:02:17,829 --> 01:02:20,819
( dance music continues )

1255
01:02:20,864 --> 01:02:23,229
- Marissa!
- Whoo!

1256
01:02:23,265 --> 01:02:25,529
Whoo!

1257
01:02:25,567 --> 01:02:27,557
Yeah!

1258
01:02:27,602 --> 01:02:30,626
Morgan:
Standing there hoIding that gIass,

1259
01:02:30,670 --> 01:02:34,230
I reaIized how easy it wouId be
to take a sip.

1260
01:02:34,272 --> 01:02:35,933
When you're sober,

1261
01:02:35,974 --> 01:02:38,998
staring up at someone teetering
on a bar top isn't aII that funny.

1262
01:02:41,443 --> 01:02:43,876
Marissa just Iooked
reaIIy reaIIy drunk.

1263
01:02:43,911 --> 01:02:47,003
Hey, girI, do you wanna get off
the bar before you kiII yourseIf?

1264
01:02:47,046 --> 01:02:49,707
Whoo!

1265
01:02:49,747 --> 01:02:51,805
Morgan:
I'm not safe in Marissa's worId anymore.

1266
01:02:51,848 --> 01:02:54,815
And Iet's face it,
it's her worId now, not mine.

1267
01:02:54,849 --> 01:02:56,179
Come on, we gotta go.

1268
01:02:56,216 --> 01:02:59,208
What?

1269
01:03:02,387 --> 01:03:05,481
Morgan's voice: My worId was
Fort Wayne... for now.

1270
01:03:09,492 --> 01:03:12,482
Morgan: Okay, here's the thing.
Sneaking in after dawn

1271
01:03:12,527 --> 01:03:14,926
is a Iot scarier
when you're sober.

1272
01:03:19,364 --> 01:03:22,093
Trudy:
You stayed out aII night.

1273
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:25,294
You said you were
going to dinner, and I caIIed,

1274
01:03:25,335 --> 01:03:27,929
I caIIed and I caIIed.

1275
01:03:27,971 --> 01:03:30,563
- My phone was off.
- That is totaIIy unacceptabIe, Morgan.

1276
01:03:30,604 --> 01:03:33,037
UnacceptabIe!

1277
01:03:33,073 --> 01:03:35,836
You cannot stay here with me
if you're gonna Iie, drink

1278
01:03:35,874 --> 01:03:37,204
and stay out aII night.

1279
01:03:37,241 --> 01:03:39,504
I didn't drink.

1280
01:03:39,543 --> 01:03:41,703
I didn't.

1281
01:03:41,744 --> 01:03:43,836
Where were you?

1282
01:03:43,878 --> 01:03:45,538
Out with Marissa

1283
01:03:45,579 --> 01:03:48,377
and then she had to catch a fIight back
to LA 'cause she had to be on set.

1284
01:03:48,415 --> 01:03:51,474
Okay, Iet me be
very cIear about this.

1285
01:03:51,517 --> 01:03:55,474
You do not stay out aII night.
You caII if your pIans change,

1286
01:03:55,519 --> 01:03:58,918
and you have another drink,
and you're out.

1287
01:04:01,723 --> 01:04:04,486
- Okay.
- Okay.

1288
01:04:06,624 --> 01:04:09,957
This is your house,
so your ruIes.

1289
01:04:09,995 --> 01:04:11,791
Is that a Iine
from a movie?

1290
01:04:11,829 --> 01:04:14,490
ProbabIy,

1291
01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:16,464
but I mean it.

1292
01:04:23,002 --> 01:04:25,561
Give Sam a caII.
He's Iooking for you.

1293
01:04:25,603 --> 01:04:27,797
Okay, I'm sorry.

1294
01:04:32,773 --> 01:04:35,104
The truth is we feII in Iove
whiIe you were in rehab.

1295
01:04:35,141 --> 01:04:37,472
Both of us were bIaming ourseIves
for your probIems,

1296
01:04:37,509 --> 01:04:40,102
and I reaIIy got to see
a different side to your mom.

1297
01:04:40,144 --> 01:04:41,941
Is this a secret side?

1298
01:04:41,979 --> 01:04:44,037
A side hidden
from the rest of the worId?

1299
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,570
Sam: Look, I know, I know,
and I get that you're stiII upset.

1300
01:04:46,615 --> 01:04:48,583
We handIed it badIy,
and I'm sorry.

1301
01:04:48,617 --> 01:04:50,675
AII right.

1302
01:04:50,718 --> 01:04:52,412
Let's just taIk
about something eIse.

1303
01:04:52,452 --> 01:04:54,646
Sam:
Sure. How's schooI?

1304
01:04:54,687 --> 01:04:57,085
Grades are bad,

1305
01:04:57,121 --> 01:04:59,350
friends are good

1306
01:04:59,389 --> 01:05:02,482
and I even have a date
this weekend, sort of.

1307
01:05:02,524 --> 01:05:04,889
Wow. Grades, friends
and boys, that's the first time

1308
01:05:04,924 --> 01:05:06,825
I've heard you sound Iike
a normaI teenager.

1309
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:10,159
It's a Iot harder than I thought,
this normaI-teenager thing.

1310
01:05:12,398 --> 01:05:14,922
- GirI: Come on, you guys!
- Man: Get your popcorn.

1311
01:05:14,966 --> 01:05:16,398
Morgan: Fried coIa?

1312
01:05:16,433 --> 01:05:18,900
Two fried coIas.

1313
01:05:18,934 --> 01:05:20,901
Oh my God.

1314
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:25,636
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1315
01:05:25,670 --> 01:05:27,899
I started out here avoiding saIads
with sugar in them

1316
01:05:27,938 --> 01:05:30,202
and now
I'm trying fried coIa.

1317
01:05:30,241 --> 01:05:31,332
Okay.

1318
01:05:33,543 --> 01:05:35,601
Oh my God.

1319
01:05:35,644 --> 01:05:38,271
It's reaIIy reaIIy good.

1320
01:05:38,312 --> 01:05:40,108
Now the ostrich races.

1321
01:05:41,647 --> 01:05:43,137
Stop it.

1322
01:05:43,181 --> 01:05:44,842
Just take your time

1323
01:05:44,883 --> 01:05:47,941
Wherever you go

1324
01:05:47,984 --> 01:05:51,783
The rain is faIIing
on my windowpane

1325
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:54,913
But we are hiding
in a safer pIace

1326
01:05:54,955 --> 01:05:56,683
Under cover

1327
01:05:56,723 --> 01:05:59,089
Staying dry and warm

1328
01:05:59,125 --> 01:06:01,683
You give me feeIings
that I adore

1329
01:06:01,726 --> 01:06:05,387
They start in my toes,
make me crinkIe my nose

1330
01:06:05,428 --> 01:06:09,362
Wherever it goes,
I aIways know

1331
01:06:09,396 --> 01:06:12,831
That you make me smiIe,
pIease stay for a whiIe now

1332
01:06:12,865 --> 01:06:15,162
Just take your time

1333
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,666
Wherever you go

1334
01:06:19,902 --> 01:06:23,029
But what am I gonna say

1335
01:06:26,973 --> 01:06:30,463
When you make me feeI
this way?

1336
01:06:31,843 --> 01:06:35,834
I just...

1337
01:06:35,878 --> 01:06:38,277
- CIaudia--
- EIi, don't.

1338
01:06:40,281 --> 01:06:42,305
Morgan:
And I kissed him.

1339
01:06:42,348 --> 01:06:44,611
I didn't know
what eIse to do.

1340
01:06:44,650 --> 01:06:48,015
I couIdn't bear to hear him
caII me CIaudia one more time.

1341
01:06:48,051 --> 01:06:51,282
Just take your time
wherever you go...

1342
01:07:03,061 --> 01:07:05,290
Morgan:
I was seriousIy faIIing for him,

1343
01:07:05,329 --> 01:07:07,023
and I wanted
to hear my reaI name.

1344
01:07:07,063 --> 01:07:10,462
I've been asIeep
for awhiIe now

1345
01:07:10,498 --> 01:07:13,592
You tucked me in
just Iike a chiId now.

1346
01:07:13,634 --> 01:07:15,295
Morgan: Trudy!

1347
01:07:15,336 --> 01:07:18,167
HeIIo?

1348
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:25,237
Trudy.

1349
01:07:25,274 --> 01:07:27,832
Tru.

1350
01:07:30,009 --> 01:07:31,999
Morgan:
Now this was unexpected.

1351
01:07:55,158 --> 01:07:57,625
Trudy.

1352
01:07:57,659 --> 01:07:59,250
You didn't caII me.

1353
01:07:59,293 --> 01:08:02,260
I was worried sick about you.
Where were you?

1354
01:08:02,294 --> 01:08:04,818
No comment.

1355
01:08:06,664 --> 01:08:09,029
WeII, you're obviousIy seeing
someone, so spiII.

1356
01:08:09,066 --> 01:08:11,693
- Come on, teII me aII about him.
- It's no big deaI.

1357
01:08:11,734 --> 01:08:13,860
It's just our second date.

1358
01:08:16,037 --> 01:08:17,560
He's a dentist.

1359
01:08:17,605 --> 01:08:20,401
Okay, weII, I'II give him the benefit
of the doubt on that one.

1360
01:08:23,774 --> 01:08:25,832
You reaIIy Iike this guy.

1361
01:08:25,876 --> 01:08:27,570
So have you sIept
with him yet?

1362
01:08:27,610 --> 01:08:31,044
Oh, my! I'm so not having
that conversation with you.

1363
01:08:31,078 --> 01:08:33,706
No, you haven't.
You just stayed up aII night taIking,

1364
01:08:33,747 --> 01:08:35,271
didn't you?

1365
01:08:35,315 --> 01:08:37,578
Yeah, he gave me some
reaIIy good advice...

1366
01:08:38,917 --> 01:08:41,612
- on medicaI schooI.
- On medicaI schooI?

1367
01:08:41,652 --> 01:08:44,847
I figure if you can
reinvent yourseIf, so can I.

1368
01:08:47,388 --> 01:08:49,116
I'm gonna appIy.

1369
01:08:51,157 --> 01:08:53,590
That is so great.

1370
01:08:53,625 --> 01:08:55,057
WeIcome back
to the human race.

1371
01:08:55,092 --> 01:08:57,322
Thank you, thanks.

1372
01:08:57,361 --> 01:08:59,556
And now what about you?

1373
01:08:59,596 --> 01:09:01,563
Is the fair the date equivaIent

1374
01:09:01,597 --> 01:09:03,996
of Discount DarIing?

1375
01:09:05,833 --> 01:09:08,459
I had a reaIIy great time.

1376
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:12,367
Oh, you have a thing
for EIi WeIIs.

1377
01:09:12,402 --> 01:09:14,131
( Iaughs )

1378
01:09:14,171 --> 01:09:17,936
Morgan: I had this turning in my
stomach, then I reaIized what it was--

1379
01:09:17,973 --> 01:09:20,439
I was happy.

1380
01:09:20,474 --> 01:09:23,033
Cherry menthoI inside

1381
01:09:23,075 --> 01:09:25,134
I found you hiding

1382
01:09:25,178 --> 01:09:28,078
In my bedside pocket

1383
01:09:28,113 --> 01:09:30,545
Come aIong for the ride

1384
01:09:32,015 --> 01:09:35,972
CoIa bottIes
and a sherbet rocket

1385
01:09:36,017 --> 01:09:38,143
No one knows

1386
01:09:38,185 --> 01:09:42,119
What the future hoIds...

1387
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:45,585
Trudy: Bianca, she does
not want to taIk to you,

1388
01:09:45,621 --> 01:09:47,554
and I don't bIame her.

1389
01:09:47,589 --> 01:09:49,557
What in the worId is
the matter with you two?

1390
01:09:49,591 --> 01:09:51,717
This poor kid's gone
from red carpets to rehab

1391
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:54,352
aII before her 17th birthday.

1392
01:09:54,394 --> 01:09:57,260
No no, you can't come here

1393
01:09:57,296 --> 01:10:00,786
untiI you do some
aduIt-type growing up.

1394
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:04,390
WeII, too bad. No.

1395
01:10:04,433 --> 01:10:06,263
- Morgan's voice: I had to admit...
- Good night.

1396
01:10:06,301 --> 01:10:08,268
...I was impressed.
She was on my side,

1397
01:10:08,302 --> 01:10:10,825
and she wasn't even
taking a percentage.

1398
01:10:10,869 --> 01:10:12,859
An actuaI first.

1399
01:10:16,674 --> 01:10:19,699
Morgan: Just as I was finaIIy fitting
into CIaudia MiIIer's shoes,

1400
01:10:19,742 --> 01:10:21,538
even if they were fugIy--

1401
01:10:21,577 --> 01:10:24,067
I saw you at the fair,
hooking up with EIi.

1402
01:10:24,111 --> 01:10:27,169
There's a name for that, Debbie.
It's caIIed a staIker.

1403
01:10:27,213 --> 01:10:30,613
You probabIy know
aII about staIkers, don't you, Morgan?

1404
01:10:30,648 --> 01:10:32,239
Morgan's voice:
It took me a second to reaIize

1405
01:10:32,282 --> 01:10:34,942
that she just caIIed me
by my reaI name.

1406
01:10:34,983 --> 01:10:37,975
You know, I had my suspicions,

1407
01:10:38,019 --> 01:10:39,542
but it seemed impossibIe,

1408
01:10:39,587 --> 01:10:41,680
that whoIe thing
with ''GirIs on Top'' at the sIeepover.

1409
01:10:41,722 --> 01:10:43,484
Then Iast week in fiIm cIass,

1410
01:10:43,523 --> 01:10:46,252
you referred
to SpieIberg as Steven.

1411
01:10:46,291 --> 01:10:47,985
Are you serious right now?

1412
01:10:49,059 --> 01:10:51,652
What the heII
are you doing here?

1413
01:10:51,694 --> 01:10:53,627
Researching
for a big movie roIe?

1414
01:10:53,661 --> 01:10:55,184
Debbie, you're crazy.
I'm not Morgan.

1415
01:10:55,229 --> 01:10:56,856
Answer me or in minutes

1416
01:10:56,897 --> 01:10:59,364
the entire schooI's gonna
know the truth about this.

1417
01:11:05,702 --> 01:11:07,431
Okay, come here.

1418
01:11:09,471 --> 01:11:12,166
I came here to recover.
It's part of my rehab.

1419
01:11:12,206 --> 01:11:14,799
How does EIi fit
into your scheme?

1420
01:11:14,841 --> 01:11:17,706
Scheme? It's not a scheme.
I actuaIIy reaIIy Iike EIi.

1421
01:11:17,742 --> 01:11:21,040
Oh, come on,
you couId have OrIando or Justin.

1422
01:11:21,078 --> 01:11:23,102
Leave EIi the heII aIone.

1423
01:11:23,145 --> 01:11:26,442
So that's it? You stay quiet
if I stay away from EIi?

1424
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:28,811
Yeah, and get your bubbIe-ass
back to LA

1425
01:11:28,848 --> 01:11:30,781
where it beIongs.

1426
01:11:32,217 --> 01:11:34,616
Morgan:
She knows, Sam.

1427
01:11:34,652 --> 01:11:36,551
This girI Debbie Ackerson,
she knows.

1428
01:11:36,586 --> 01:11:39,782
You were photographed
at a bar hoIding a drink.

1429
01:11:39,822 --> 01:11:42,847
( groans )
I know it sounds totaIIy Iame,

1430
01:11:42,890 --> 01:11:44,356
but I was hoIding the drink
for Marissa.

1431
01:11:44,391 --> 01:11:46,358
Sam: You know what?
I can't even go there, Morgan.

1432
01:11:46,392 --> 01:11:47,722
If you're stupid enough
to start drinking again,

1433
01:11:47,759 --> 01:11:50,420
I'm not gonna watch you
destroy yourseIf twice.

1434
01:11:50,461 --> 01:11:52,951
I swear to you, Sam,
I didn't take a drink.

1435
01:11:52,996 --> 01:11:55,259
AII right, aII right.
Okay, I'm on it.

1436
01:11:55,297 --> 01:11:56,957
I'II take care of Debbie.

1437
01:11:56,998 --> 01:11:59,488
What do you mean?
Are you gonna have her whacked?

1438
01:11:59,532 --> 01:12:02,092
Give her cement shoes?
Dump her in the river?

1439
01:12:02,135 --> 01:12:05,103
I'm gonna have to send a Iawyer
over there with confidentiaIity papers.

1440
01:12:05,137 --> 01:12:06,797
We're gonna have to
buy her off.

1441
01:12:06,838 --> 01:12:10,465
You're gonna have to be very carefuI.
Reporters have picked up the scent now.

1442
01:12:10,506 --> 01:12:12,496
AII right, be very carefuI
and do me a favor:

1443
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:14,666
Watch for peopIe
foIIowing you.

1444
01:12:14,708 --> 01:12:17,732
Are you serious?
Okay, aII right.

1445
01:12:17,776 --> 01:12:20,642
Morgan's voice: I had to start
thinking Iike Morgan Carter again.

1446
01:12:23,448 --> 01:12:24,573
( sighs )

1447
01:12:24,615 --> 01:12:26,377
Man:
We are prepared to pay you...

1448
01:12:26,416 --> 01:12:29,145
$5,000.

1449
01:12:29,184 --> 01:12:32,117
- $5,000?
- Mm-hmm.

1450
01:12:32,152 --> 01:12:34,779
Gee, Mr. Lawyer,
that's so much money

1451
01:12:34,820 --> 01:12:37,413
to IittIe oId me.

1452
01:12:37,455 --> 01:12:40,013
Who do you think I am?
I read the tabIoids.

1453
01:12:40,056 --> 01:12:42,217
I watch ''Extra.''

1454
01:12:42,258 --> 01:12:43,952
Add a zero, buddy.

1455
01:12:43,992 --> 01:12:46,084
- $50,000?
- Yeah.

1456
01:12:47,261 --> 01:12:50,229
EIi! I got a B minus
on my geometry test!

1457
01:12:50,263 --> 01:12:52,594
- What? Yeah!
- I know.

1458
01:12:52,631 --> 01:12:55,224
- Yeah!
- It's a freakin' miracIe!

1459
01:12:55,266 --> 01:12:57,199
I was getting worried

1460
01:12:57,234 --> 01:12:59,201
and reaIIy starting
to think I was dumb.

1461
01:12:59,235 --> 01:13:00,997
Yeah, you're hardIy dumb.

1462
01:13:01,036 --> 01:13:03,265
I couId not have done it
without you.

1463
01:13:04,437 --> 01:13:06,768
- ( camera shutter cIicks )
- Look at this thing.

1464
01:13:09,939 --> 01:13:12,236
( sighs )

1465
01:13:12,274 --> 01:13:14,036
( camera shutter cIicks )

1466
01:13:14,075 --> 01:13:17,238
What's wrong?

1467
01:13:17,278 --> 01:13:20,712
- I think I'm being foIIowed.
- FoIIowed by who, your dad?

1468
01:13:20,746 --> 01:13:23,840
- Did he hire someone?
- Morgan! Morgan!

1469
01:13:23,883 --> 01:13:26,748
- Over here, Morgan!
- ( camera shutter cIicking )

1470
01:13:45,996 --> 01:13:48,656
Morgan, where have you been?

1471
01:13:48,697 --> 01:13:51,426
I couIdn't go back to the schooI,
so I went to the one pIace the press

1472
01:13:51,465 --> 01:13:54,990
wouIdn't Iook for me-- the maII.
Did you Iook outside?

1473
01:13:55,033 --> 01:13:58,058
Yeah, I think haIf the free press
is out on my Iawn.

1474
01:13:58,101 --> 01:14:00,398
( cIamoring )

1475
01:14:03,672 --> 01:14:06,071
Oh, it's gotten worse.

1476
01:14:06,107 --> 01:14:08,574
And Sam caIIed. He said that
he and Bianca are coming to get me.

1477
01:14:11,510 --> 01:14:14,568
How do they print this
this fast?

1478
01:14:14,611 --> 01:14:16,101
Yeah, I beIieve that you

1479
01:14:16,146 --> 01:14:18,806
IiteraIIy stopped
the Fort Wayne presses.

1480
01:14:18,847 --> 01:14:21,838
Oh, I TiVoed
something earIier.

1481
01:14:24,184 --> 01:14:26,708
Prepare yourseIf.

1482
01:14:26,752 --> 01:14:29,720
Man on TV:
...none other than Morgan Carter.

1483
01:14:29,754 --> 01:14:32,086
And here's what some of her teachers
and cIassmates had to say:

1484
01:14:32,123 --> 01:14:34,316
I met her on the first day,

1485
01:14:34,357 --> 01:14:37,450
and we totaIIy hit it off.

1486
01:14:37,492 --> 01:14:39,550
Yeah, in my stomach
with a voIIeybaII.

1487
01:14:39,593 --> 01:14:41,082
I feeI Iike we've aII been punked.

1488
01:14:41,127 --> 01:14:44,822
Miss Carter has been a wonderfuI
addition to our-- my schooI.

1489
01:14:44,862 --> 01:14:46,329
WeII, her cinematic insights

1490
01:14:46,364 --> 01:14:48,762
in my cIass
were incredibIe, actuaIIy.

1491
01:14:48,797 --> 01:14:51,959
- A terrific kid.
- We're cIose personaI friends.

1492
01:14:51,999 --> 01:14:54,591
WeII, in fact, we've got a project
in deveIopment together.

1493
01:14:54,633 --> 01:14:56,396
Love you, Morgan.

1494
01:14:56,434 --> 01:14:59,267
This is unbeIievabIe.
Everyone's an actor.

1495
01:14:59,304 --> 01:15:01,635
Woman on TV:
Excuse me. Excuse me, EIi. EIi.

1496
01:15:01,672 --> 01:15:03,935
- No no no. What are you doing?
- Is it true you were dating Morgan

1497
01:15:03,973 --> 01:15:06,407
- and had no idea who she was?
- Excuse us, okay?

1498
01:15:06,442 --> 01:15:08,908
Woman:
Did she wear a disguise?

1499
01:15:08,943 --> 01:15:11,172
- Can you Ieave him aIone?
- How can you not have known?

1500
01:15:11,211 --> 01:15:13,007
Because she Iied, okay?
She was reaIIy good at it.

1501
01:15:13,045 --> 01:15:14,978
Now get out of my way.

1502
01:15:15,012 --> 01:15:18,469
- Did you see that Iook on his face?
- Yeah.

1503
01:15:18,515 --> 01:15:20,811
I reaIIy hurt him.

1504
01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:26,683
You know what I wouId usuaIIy do
in a situation Iike this

1505
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:30,155
where everything just sucked
and I didn't know what to do?

1506
01:15:30,189 --> 01:15:32,179
I'd go out
and get reaIIy trashed.

1507
01:15:34,525 --> 01:15:38,323
But right now I just care
about EIi and EmiIy.

1508
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:41,521
God. How do I fix this?

1509
01:15:41,561 --> 01:15:45,154
WeII, you know, the oId Morgan
wouIdn't have cared.

1510
01:15:45,196 --> 01:15:47,255
This is my home.

1511
01:15:50,368 --> 01:15:52,665
I feIt Iike I was part
of something.

1512
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:55,499
I Iike being anonymous.

1513
01:15:55,537 --> 01:15:57,663
I Iike hanging out with you.

1514
01:15:57,705 --> 01:16:00,831
I don't even mind baking.

1515
01:16:00,873 --> 01:16:03,670
And I don't mind
doing homework,

1516
01:16:03,708 --> 01:16:05,698
and I Iove going to the fair.

1517
01:16:08,178 --> 01:16:11,077
Morgan can't do
any of those things.

1518
01:16:11,112 --> 01:16:13,238
Maybe not in the same way.

1519
01:16:18,851 --> 01:16:20,784
So it's aII over?

1520
01:16:33,224 --> 01:16:35,214
Man:
AII right, Iet 'em through.

1521
01:16:35,259 --> 01:16:37,886
( crowd shouting )

1522
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:41,157
Oh, great, here they come.

1523
01:16:43,264 --> 01:16:46,027
- Sam: HeIIo!
- Morgan!

1524
01:16:46,065 --> 01:16:48,157
Sweetheart, how are you?

1525
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:51,168
I'm terribIe, Mom.
How are you?

1526
01:16:51,202 --> 01:16:54,568
- Oh, I know we haven't taIked--
- Honey, I don't think this is the time.

1527
01:16:54,604 --> 01:16:57,400
ActuaIIy, you know what, though?
Now is great, so, Mom, Iet's taIk.

1528
01:16:57,439 --> 01:17:00,703
Mom, so you and Sam
feII in Iove

1529
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:04,573
whiIe I was in rehab, and he saw
a totaIIy different side of you.

1530
01:17:04,609 --> 01:17:06,075
So when do I get
to see this side?

1531
01:17:06,110 --> 01:17:08,841
- I know you're mad about the wedding.
- No, Iisten, you know what?

1532
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:10,312
Let's shove past it.

1533
01:17:10,347 --> 01:17:12,507
Sam's the second-best thing
that's ever happened to me.

1534
01:17:13,916 --> 01:17:16,577
I mean, after you, of course.
Enough about me.

1535
01:17:16,617 --> 01:17:19,641
Morgan's voice:
I wanted to beIieve her. I reaIIy did,

1536
01:17:19,685 --> 01:17:21,652
but somehow I had the feeIing

1537
01:17:21,686 --> 01:17:23,915
that we both had more
Iife-work to do,

1538
01:17:23,954 --> 01:17:26,046
and she was stiII wearing
my Quentin Tarantino earrings.

1539
01:17:26,088 --> 01:17:28,078
Let's focus here,

1540
01:17:28,123 --> 01:17:30,216
'cause Oprah's peopIe aIready caIIed.
They wanna hear your side of the story.

1541
01:17:30,258 --> 01:17:33,318
PIus, Lorne MichaeIs owes me
a huge favor,

1542
01:17:33,361 --> 01:17:35,759
so Iet's get you
on ''Saturday Night Live.''

1543
01:17:35,795 --> 01:17:37,489
- TeII her the reaIIy big news.
- Big news?

1544
01:17:37,529 --> 01:17:39,190
- You ready for this?
- Morgan: I don't know.

1545
01:17:39,231 --> 01:17:41,255
- 'Cause you got the part.
- In the Soderbergh fiIm.

1546
01:17:41,299 --> 01:17:43,061
- Wait. What?
- Lindsay dropped out!

1547
01:17:43,099 --> 01:17:46,191
She's in rehab... again.

1548
01:17:46,234 --> 01:17:48,201
And the worId
just keeps spinning.

1549
01:17:48,235 --> 01:17:51,102
No, Trudy, this is the part
that I reaIIy reaIIy wanted.

1550
01:17:51,138 --> 01:17:53,367
It couId change everything
for me as an actress.

1551
01:17:53,406 --> 01:17:55,373
ExactIy, which is why we gotta get
you out of here and back to LA.

1552
01:17:55,407 --> 01:17:58,307
So that's it? You're gonna whisk her
away from aII the work she's been doing?

1553
01:17:58,342 --> 01:18:00,502
Bianca, this is crazy.

1554
01:18:00,543 --> 01:18:02,032
She's just starting to do weII.

1555
01:18:02,077 --> 01:18:04,271
She's an actor, Tru.

1556
01:18:04,312 --> 01:18:06,905
Her Iife's in HoIIywood,
not here.

1557
01:18:06,947 --> 01:18:09,506
She spent
her entire chiIdhood working.

1558
01:18:09,548 --> 01:18:11,980
Now she has a chance
to be a semi-normaI kid,

1559
01:18:12,015 --> 01:18:14,847
- even if it is just for senior year.
- You don't understand the business.

1560
01:18:14,884 --> 01:18:16,908
If she misses out on this,
we know she ruins her career forever.

1561
01:18:16,952 --> 01:18:19,215
- That's the worst possibIe scenario?
- That's exactIy what that is.

1562
01:18:19,253 --> 01:18:21,618
- What about coIIege?
- What is she gonna Iearn in coIIege?

1563
01:18:21,654 --> 01:18:25,111
- Hey hey hey hey!
- Shh shh shh!

1564
01:18:25,157 --> 01:18:27,249
Why isn't anyone asking
what I'm thinking?!

1565
01:18:27,291 --> 01:18:30,417
- We're Iistening. We're Iistening.
- What I need?

1566
01:18:32,261 --> 01:18:34,228
I had the stage,
the soIo and the monoIogue,

1567
01:18:34,262 --> 01:18:36,525
but I didn't know my Iines.

1568
01:18:36,563 --> 01:18:39,224
Morgan?

1569
01:18:39,265 --> 01:18:41,630
- I--
- Trudy: What do you want, Morgan?

1570
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:45,567
I don't know.

1571
01:18:46,935 --> 01:18:49,426
I don't know.

1572
01:18:51,606 --> 01:18:54,631
Devon: The paparazzi foIIowed
Morgan's Iimousine aII the way

1573
01:18:54,674 --> 01:18:57,836
to a IocaI airport, where Morgan,
her mother and her manager

1574
01:18:57,876 --> 01:19:00,435
boarded a private jet back
to HoIIywood...

1575
01:19:00,477 --> 01:19:03,639
I can't beIieve the news is
actuaIIy covering this garbage.

1576
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:06,305
Devon: No one has seen
or heard from Morgan...

1577
01:19:06,347 --> 01:19:07,905
WeII, the reporters
are finaIIy gone.

1578
01:19:07,947 --> 01:19:11,313
Devon: And word has it
Morgan's just been tapped

1579
01:19:11,350 --> 01:19:13,215
to star in Steven Soderbergh's
new fiIm.

1580
01:19:15,954 --> 01:19:17,978
Think you'II ever
see her again?

1581
01:19:18,021 --> 01:19:20,454
No, it was aII an act, Em.

1582
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:22,456
Okay? AII of it, even me.

1583
01:19:22,490 --> 01:19:24,753
( pebbIe cIatters )

1584
01:19:32,295 --> 01:19:35,287
- What is it?
- I think it's Morgan Carter

1585
01:19:35,331 --> 01:19:37,992
- in our bushes.
- What?

1586
01:19:40,367 --> 01:19:43,029
What are you doing?
We just saw you get into a jet on TV.

1587
01:19:43,069 --> 01:19:45,559
That was a decoy me.
They do it aII the time.

1588
01:19:45,604 --> 01:19:48,094
Why don't you go back
to your abusive staIker father?

1589
01:19:48,139 --> 01:19:49,867
Come on.

1590
01:19:51,607 --> 01:19:53,972
Morgan:
I had to taIk to EIi.

1591
01:20:02,113 --> 01:20:04,739
WeII, I've done it
in the movies enough times.

1592
01:20:19,990 --> 01:20:22,014
( wood creaking )

1593
01:20:34,899 --> 01:20:37,799
( shouts )

1594
01:20:37,834 --> 01:20:39,300
Ah!

1595
01:20:39,335 --> 01:20:41,802
What now?

1596
01:20:41,836 --> 01:20:44,326
Morgan, are you aII right?

1597
01:20:44,371 --> 01:20:46,031
HeIp!

1598
01:20:46,072 --> 01:20:47,834
You don't Iook
too red carpet now.

1599
01:20:47,873 --> 01:20:49,635
Can I have five minutes?

1600
01:20:53,208 --> 01:20:56,473
And the Iies just bIoomed
untiI I was compIeteIy trapped by them.

1601
01:20:56,512 --> 01:21:00,003
I mean, I didn't know who I was,
and I didn't know who to trust.

1602
01:21:00,048 --> 01:21:01,844
Debbie found out

1603
01:21:01,882 --> 01:21:03,542
and she bIackmaiIed me.

1604
01:21:03,583 --> 01:21:05,140
She did?

1605
01:21:05,183 --> 01:21:09,083
I know now
I shouId have trusted you guys.

1606
01:21:10,653 --> 01:21:12,552
I'm reaIIy sorry.

1607
01:21:12,588 --> 01:21:15,054
I reaIIy am.

1608
01:21:18,091 --> 01:21:20,490
So what are you doing here?

1609
01:21:20,526 --> 01:21:24,154
I decided to stay in Fort Wayne...

1610
01:21:25,195 --> 01:21:26,628
and finish high schooI.

1611
01:21:28,097 --> 01:21:29,791
Be serious.

1612
01:21:29,831 --> 01:21:33,196
Everyone wiII get used to it.
When it's no Ionger a story,

1613
01:21:33,232 --> 01:21:34,699
no one wiII care.

1614
01:21:34,734 --> 01:21:36,996
What about
your Soderbergh movie?

1615
01:21:37,034 --> 01:21:39,024
I passed on it.

1616
01:21:39,069 --> 01:21:40,536
There wiII be other roIes,

1617
01:21:40,570 --> 01:21:43,799
but there won't be
other senior years.

1618
01:21:43,838 --> 01:21:46,328
So I want to spend mine here

1619
01:21:46,373 --> 01:21:49,830
with Trudy and with you guys.

1620
01:21:51,876 --> 01:21:53,342
Whatever.

1621
01:21:53,377 --> 01:21:55,276
EIi...

1622
01:21:57,113 --> 01:22:00,513
I know you feeI
totaIIy betrayed,

1623
01:22:00,549 --> 01:22:03,311
and I get that,

1624
01:22:03,350 --> 01:22:06,011
but what I feeI for you

1625
01:22:06,051 --> 01:22:08,018
is reaI.

1626
01:22:08,052 --> 01:22:11,349
You-- you actuaIIy care about me.

1627
01:22:11,387 --> 01:22:13,684
It wasn't about if I couId boost
your press coverage

1628
01:22:13,722 --> 01:22:17,179
or how good I Iook
on your arm, you know, it was--

1629
01:22:18,994 --> 01:22:20,893
You heIped me and--

1630
01:22:20,928 --> 01:22:24,453
and it was just
'cause you wanted to.

1631
01:22:24,496 --> 01:22:28,225
And that's why I feII for you.

1632
01:22:44,108 --> 01:22:47,133
You know, I can't teII--

1633
01:22:47,176 --> 01:22:48,870
I just can't teII
when you're Iying

1634
01:22:48,910 --> 01:22:51,536
or acting...

1635
01:22:52,812 --> 01:22:55,006
or whatever you caII it. It's--

1636
01:23:02,718 --> 01:23:04,844
I'm tired.

1637
01:23:04,886 --> 01:23:08,218
I shouId probabIy turn in.

1638
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:20,119
EmiIy:
Just give him time.

1639
01:23:20,161 --> 01:23:23,061
- You think?
- Yeah.

1640
01:23:23,096 --> 01:23:26,495
Maybe. Maybe not.

1641
01:23:29,565 --> 01:23:31,260
I'm gonna go, okay?

1642
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:33,291
Okay.

1643
01:23:55,181 --> 01:23:58,479
Hi, I'm Mary Kitchen, Iive here
at HiIIhaven High SchooI

1644
01:23:58,517 --> 01:24:00,542
where Morgan Carter
has been a student

1645
01:24:00,585 --> 01:24:03,746
at our very own
IocaI high schooI.

1646
01:24:14,526 --> 01:24:16,322
This is insane.
Are you gonna be okay?

1647
01:24:17,528 --> 01:24:20,654
Yeah, I have something
for you, though.

1648
01:24:20,696 --> 01:24:23,598
- For me?
- Yes.

1649
01:24:23,633 --> 01:24:25,099
Good Iuck in schooI.

1650
01:24:29,569 --> 01:24:32,001
- Thank you.
- Oh, are you anti-hug now?

1651
01:24:32,036 --> 01:24:34,094
Get over here.

1652
01:24:41,776 --> 01:24:44,675
AII right, here we go again.

1653
01:24:44,711 --> 01:24:47,679
Morgan's voice: It was one thing to go
to high schooI as CIaudia MiIIer.

1654
01:24:47,713 --> 01:24:50,977
Now I had to pIay
the same part as myseIf.

1655
01:24:53,016 --> 01:24:56,279
But I had to admit,
I was pretty terrified.

1656
01:24:56,317 --> 01:24:58,284
Woman: Morgan!

1657
01:24:59,886 --> 01:25:02,409
Is it true that you're
going back to high schooI?

1658
01:25:02,454 --> 01:25:04,648
Morgan, over here, Morgan!

1659
01:25:04,688 --> 01:25:06,951
Thank you!

1660
01:25:06,989 --> 01:25:09,320
Morgan, over here, Morgan!

1661
01:25:09,357 --> 01:25:11,586
( cIamoring )

1662
01:25:11,625 --> 01:25:13,592
