[Man] Stay out of
my goddamn trash!

6
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,902
[Blaze] Get in.

00:01:11,403 --> 00:01:13,739
[slow music]

8
00:01:50,025 --> 00:01:50,859
Come on.

9
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,284
All right, stop.

10
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:13,466
- Throw it on the scale.
- I'll be there

11
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,427
about six o'clock if you
wanna bring the cars over.

12
00:02:15,467 --> 00:02:19,263
I won't have time to break them
down for parts today, okay.

13
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,432
I'll pull them

14
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,641
- to the weigh station
- There you go.

15
00:02:21,682 --> 00:02:23,600
and I'll have one
of my boys come out.

16
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,812
And I'll talk to you soon.

17
00:02:34,862 --> 00:02:37,032
- There you go.
- Thanks man.

18
00:02:39,324 --> 00:02:40,451
Is that it?

19
00:02:40,492 --> 00:02:42,620
[Hark] Yeah,
that's the new price.

20
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,790
Fuck, man, we brought in
more than this last week, Hark.

21
00:02:45,831 --> 00:02:47,542
Okay, well, you
can take your cans

22
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,127
and you can go to
another junk yard.

23
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,171
[Blaze] My sister and
me are behind on the rent.

24
00:02:51,211 --> 00:02:53,714
Well, then start
bringing in more pop cans.

25
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:56,134
All right, thanks.

26
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,762

29
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:08,979
It can be summed up in
three very beautiful words,

30
00:03:09,021 --> 00:03:12,191
jobs, jobs, jobs.

- Hey there.

38
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,903
- How goes, Linda?
- Oh you know

39
00:03:56,944 --> 00:03:59,197
- Morning.
- Making the money, honey.

40
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,200
Hey, stop by my house later, I
put the old washer on the porch,

41
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:04,034
it should be worth something.

42
00:04:04,076 --> 00:04:05,537
Yes, ma'am.

43
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:10,290
Here eat this, eat this and
you got your thermos, right.

44
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,377
I'll eat the pretzels.

45
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,587
- Hey beautiful.
- My feet are killing me.

46
00:04:14,628 --> 00:04:18,591
- You sell a lot this morning?
- Yeah, a little bit.

47
00:04:18,632 --> 00:04:21,260
- Hey Tonya, my smokes.
- You said I could have one.

48
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:23,722
Yeah, one, not chow
down on my menthols

49
00:04:23,762 --> 00:04:25,222
like a goddamn snack pack.

50
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:26,598
Can you believe this girl.

51
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,728
Shit.

52
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,562
I heard Phil talking to
management the other day.

53
00:04:31,603 --> 00:04:34,274
Oh don't go getting
rumor mill started, Levi.

54
00:04:34,314 --> 00:04:36,567
Seems like this overseas
company's buying up.

55
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:38,235
You did not hear that.

56
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,237
Last thing I need to do
is go in front of a judge

57
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,114
and have to explain why I
can't pay my child support.

58
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,074
[Linda] Yeah, well stop having
so many goddamn kids then.

59
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,076
[Levi] Oh hell, Linda, they
can bury me with this place.

60
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,580
[Linda] You will be
buried in this place.

61
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,873
- What?
- Nothing.

62
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:53,584
Blaze, I'm gonna be late.

63
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,085
Okay.

64
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:56,837
[Linda] Your brother take
his test to work here yet?

65
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,213
He's studying for it.

66
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:00,632
I miss having your
mom around here.

67
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,093
I got them to keep
her at the county jail

68
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,971
until she agrees to rehab.

69
00:05:05,012 --> 00:05:06,472
- Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

70
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,307
You oughta think about
putting an application in here.

71
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,768
Don't listen to him.

72
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,437
Have you always been
a grumpy bitch, Linda?

73
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,271
Yeah, you bring
out in me, Levi,

74
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,939
just like my second husband.

75
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,568
[siren blares]

76
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:27,326
Hey, tell Rhonda that everybody
here is rooting for her.

77
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:29,203
- Thank you, Linda.
- Okay.

78
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,622
- Thanks, Linda.
- Bye, baby.

79
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,456
- See you around, let's go.
- You guys be good.

80
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,125
- Yep.
- Dude, she's nasty.

81
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,626
No, she's not, don't
start, Ruth, seriously.

82
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:36,627
[Tonya] What the fuck
did you just say about me?

83
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,961
She's fucked
everyone on third shift

84
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,172
that's why she's back on third.

85
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,464
[Tonya] You think
you're better than me?

86
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,175
You blew a cop for
a set of acrylics.

87
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,634
[Blaze] Hey, Ruth, come on,
hey go.

88
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:44,843
Well, you think

89
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,304
you're better than me, why don't you
come here and say that to my face?

90
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,555
I'll call you.

91
00:05:47,596 --> 00:05:49,515
- Goddamn it, Ruth.
- Fucking bitch.

92
00:06:01,026 --> 00:06:03,070
Anything?
What?

93
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:06,490
It looks like
a paternity test.

94
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,492
[Blaze] What, what test?

95
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:09,369
It's got your name on it.

96
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:10,745
Let me see.

97
00:06:10,786 --> 00:06:12,413
The mail is not
here yet, it's old,

98
00:06:12,454 --> 00:06:14,164
- you gotta wrap it up, bro.
- All right, thanks, smart-ass.

99
00:06:14,206 --> 00:06:15,375
Hey, Crystal.

100
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,834
I really need
that take home test.

101
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,168
I know, I got you,
I'm gonna go inside.

102
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,672
Hey, Bella.

103
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,339
I'll just swing by
later and get it then.

104
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,050
- Okay, see you.
- All right, bye.

105

00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,610
- Hey.
- Hey.

109
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,278
- [indistinct] up.
- Here's that.

110
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,114
Thank you.

111
00:08:09,154 --> 00:08:11,990

This is some smart shit.

115
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:19,958
How many credits
do you have left?

116
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,793
Just this one class
and then the high school

117
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:25,295
mails the diploma but
like I really need algebra

118
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,840
to work line four.

119
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,637
No, no, I don't
need any money.

120
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,682
No, it's from Mom's purse,
seriously, here take it.

121
00:08:36,932 --> 00:08:37,766
Thank you.

122
00:08:38,934 --> 00:08:41,353
- I miss you at school.
- Yeah, yeah.

[baby coos]

124
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,817
- See you next week.
- See you next week.

125
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,154
- Pleasure doing business.
- Later.

126

[school bell rings]

128
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,593
- Show me the bag.
- Why?

129
00:10:36,635 --> 00:10:39,930
- Open the bag, Ruth.
- Don't touch my bag!

130
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:43,142
- Get off me!
- Miss Avery!

131
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,647
[Man] And she stole
one last week too.

132
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,274
[Ruth] You won't let
me check them out.

133
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,192
Because you have
bad attendance.

134
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:54,112
Six times she's been to the
resource officer this year.

135
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,280
If I was one of
your football players,

136
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,615
we wouldn't have
this conversation.

137
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,117
It's because I'm an Avery.

138
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,951
Ruth, we believe you
could be anything you want.

139
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,288
Well, I don't wanna
be in this room anymore,

140
00:11:03,328 --> 00:11:04,830
so can I be that?

141
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,086
Hands on the wall.

142
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:21,139
You don't have permission
to put me in here,

143
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,516
you have to have permission.

144
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,186
What am I supposed to do?

145
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,693
[slow music]

146
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:46,997
[Police woman] Come on out,

147
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:47,873
Mom will be thrilled
you're on time today.

148
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,971
- You gave them permission?
- Yep.

149
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,404
Come on back.

150
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,295
Hi, you look tired.

151
00:12:35,462 --> 00:12:37,923
I feel tired, I've
been working all day.

152
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:38,924
You look it.

153
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,679
What, I don't get nothing?

154
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,060
- You seeing anyone?
- No, just talking.

155
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,645
- Just talking.
- Hmm-mm.

156
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,981
Hmm-mm, you better
be just talking.

157
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:56,442
I don't want you to go
knocking up a factory girl

158
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:59,487
and making a grandma out of
me while I'm in this place.

159
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:00,947
You can always
go to the clinic.

160
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:03,490
I wanna be in my own bed.

161
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:05,659
Rehabs are all
full right now, Mom,

162
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:08,413
you know, you just gotta
stay positive, that's all.

163
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:12,625
I'm positive, I'm a positive
person, are you positive?

164
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,293
Yeah, I'm positive, yeah.

165
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:20,799
Linda says hi, she was
saying that there's a clinic

166
00:13:22,634 --> 00:13:25,096
down in Florida that
you should check out.

167
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:28,182
I mean, you might as well
just look at it, Mom,

168
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,393
it's better than
county jail, right?

169
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:37,442
They found a head about 10
miles from here last week,

170
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:42,489
a human head, okay,
go find that guy,

171
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,448
put that person in jail,

172
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,701
I'm in here trying to get clean

173
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:49,162
and everybody thinks
I'm a criminal,

174
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,372
- Mom.
- and now even my own son

175
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,040
is trying to send me away.

176
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,458
[Blaze] Nobody thinks
you're a criminal.

177
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,251
If I'm in here they do.

178
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,965
Not half a head, a whole head.

179
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,550
I heard the lesbian
talking about it last week.

180
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:06,178
- Not a lesbian.
- You look it.

181
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:08,597
Mom, stop.

182
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:15,355
- You're awfully quiet.
- I've got nothing to say.

183
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,860
I was thinking that
when I get out of here

184
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:26,240
that I would come back
and stay with you two.

185
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,118
[Blaze] We'll see, yeah.

186
00:14:29,576 --> 00:14:32,371
Well, I'll be out in 30
days and I'm clean now so.

187
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,667
- Mom.
- You should test my piss.

188
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,835
- Mom.
- Test my piss.

189
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:40,754
Make the lesbian get
a cup, I'll pee in it.

190
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:41,630
Mom.

191
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,512
[Blaze] Listen, you
can either go to Florida

192
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,722
or you can stay with Linda at
the end of 30 days, all right,

193
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:52,683
and that's what
we gotta do, okay?

194
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:56,730
No, I supposed we don't have
to decide anything right now.

195
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,153
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you too.

196
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:21,129
- What is this?
- Let me see.

197
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,051
- Oh my god.
- What is it?

198
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,092
Oh my god.

199
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,263
- Where is the school?
- Hey.

200
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,768
- Oh my god.
- What?

201
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,352
Oh my fucking god.

202
00:15:37,644 --> 00:15:42,649
- Get off me!
- You just got into college.

203
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,611
I didn't apply to college.

204
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,281
Oh, what the
hell's your problem?

205
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,783
You going through my
shit, that is my problem.

206
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,241
What, you don't wanna go,

207
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,660
you're living it
up big here, huh?

208
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,245
Why'd you fill out
the whole application

209
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,413
if you didn't wanna go, why'd
you fill out the whole essay

210
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:57,664
and everything?

211
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,750
It wasn't yours
to turn in, Blaze.

212
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:02,419
- Are you kidding me?
- Hey, hey,

213
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,797
- keep it down over there!
- Hey, but Vick,

214
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,255
Ruthie just got into college.

215
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,799
- Well, good for her!
- That is so embarrassing.

216
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,301
Keep your fucking voices down!

217
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,760
Why did you fill it out,
if you didn't wanna go?

218
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,931
There's nothing I
can learn in school

219
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:14,807
that I can't learn here.

220
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:16,100
You can have a life there.

221
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:17,811
I have a life here with you.

222
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,478
What life are
you talking about?

223
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,771
I'm watching you!

224
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:21,647
Vicki, if you
got into college,

225
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:22,691
would you be living here?

226
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,192
Shut the hell up!

227
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:25,860
Jesus Christ, Vicki, you can
have your full conversation

228
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,112
in the house.

229
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,529
- You don't have to,
- I'm on the phone,

230
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,115
you can have it inside,
mind your own business!

231
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,615
you don't have to stand
out on the goddamn porch!

232
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,118
Jesus Christ, Vicki, all
right, have a great evening.

233
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,828
Ruth, hey.

234
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:39,666
Water's still off.

235
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:40,791
Yeah, 'cause I shelled out
$75 bucks for this application,

236
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,002
that's some life here, huh?

237
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,461
I had to call the school

238
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,130
and beg them to take
this thing late.

239
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,465
You should have heard
me over the phone.

240
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,299
Don't blame Ruth for
her stupid brother.

241
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,968
If I wanted to turn it in,
I would have turned it in,

242
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,469
mind your own business.

243
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,971
You are my, legally,
you are my business, Ruth.

244
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:56,182
Goddamn it.

245
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:15,035
[slow music]

246
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:09,297
Get in.

247
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:16,096
You can't get gas money
out of [indistinct].

248
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:19,557
Ruth, you got
in, you're going.

249
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,766
We can't afford it.

250
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,317
What are you doing?

251
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,785
Really in broad daylight?

252
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,796
Be more than gas money, right?

253
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,480
Hey!

254
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:25,373
Are you planning on
selling me my own scrap?

255
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,291
- Yeah, so.
- Yeah, so.

256
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:29,169
- You're not paying us enough.
- Ruth.

257
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,840
We got no water,
it's not enough.

258
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:38,845
That sounds like
you're calling me cheap.

259
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:40,596
Yeah.

260
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,023
You two follow me.

261
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,989
So how much you looking to make?

262
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:03,036
- More than $50.
- I like her.

263
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:05,538
You know I get a few
construction gigs here and there

264
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:06,497
- but no one's hiring.
- I need extra scrap

265
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,166
but it's not raccoon's, okay.

266
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:12,003
Yeah, we're more than cans
and bottles, sweetheart,

267
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,839
you gotta, have you
looked around this town?

268
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:17,509
Manufacturing is drying
up left and right,

269
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,177
leaving behind old dozers
that's rotting away.

270
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,722
We scrap the metal and
we sell it to China

271
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:25,266
straight from the yard.

272
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:30,020
I'm talking modern
day gold bonds.

273
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:32,357
Seven grand a month
between the two of you.

274
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,858
Sounds illegal.

275
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:37,528
Well, you didn't have a
problem with that a minute ago,

276
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,404
did you?

277
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,158
We'll think about it.

278
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,249
[slow music]

279
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:01,028
All right, drop, like
I told you, good job.

280
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,412
Come on back now.

281
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,300
Hey, what are you doing here?

282
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:25,135
Hark brought us
on, is he around?

283
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:26,638
You too, sweetheart?

284
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,555
I'm here to work.

285
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:32,018
- He's inside.
- All right.

286
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,855
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

287
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:37,899
- You made it.
- Yeah.

288
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:39,983
- Nice place.
- Got a little something for you.

289
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:40,902
Hey, cheers.

290
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:41,819
- Cheers.
- Thanks, man.

291
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:43,153
- That's-
- This all you?

292
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,365
Yeah, this is all
me, that's Willie.

293
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:46,281
Willie!

294
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,826
Come on, come on.

295
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,828
Ah, there we go, come on.

296
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,705
Good boy, come on.

297
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,923
Holy hell, that's pretty nice.

298
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,215
This is it.

299
00:23:03,258 --> 00:23:07,345
- Yeah, my house is your house.
- All right.

300
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,346
Why don't you
follow me back here.

301
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,389
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

302
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,852
- Willie, sit.
- Here you go.

303
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:16,688
- Will he get sick?
- He misses every now and then.

304
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:20,733
No, he doesn't, he's
there we go, good boy.

305
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:22,861
This is my crossbow too.

306
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,612
- Oh yeah, get out of here.
- Oh yeah, feel it.

307
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,906
- Oh, shit.
- Heavy huh?

308
00:23:27,949 --> 00:23:29,743
[Blaze] Oh you can do some
serious damage with this.

309
00:23:29,784 --> 00:23:31,036
Yeah, I'll teach
you how to use it

310
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,244
- one of these days.
- Yeah, all right.

311
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:34,204
[Pudge] Yeah, he said
the same thing to me.

312
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:36,207
[Blaze] That's killer,
man, you play a lot of games?

313
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:37,625
[Hark] I do, yeah.

314
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,126
[Hark laughs]

315
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:41,421
Well, this is where it
happens, where we hang out.

316
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:42,547
You guys like it?

317
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:44,381
It's perfect, man.

318
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,134
[Hark laughs]

319
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:47,968
- Come check this out.
- All right.

320
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:59,064
- So, yeah, this is it.
- Yeah.

321
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:03,567
And, oh, you know what tomorrow
I got a buyer coming down

322
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:06,945
first thing in the morning,
so if you guys want to come and work or...

323
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:08,907
Yeah, of course,
yeah, thanks, man.

324
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,617
I get another beer.

325
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,076
- Yeah, cheers.
- Yeah, enjoy.

326
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,410
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

327
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,747
[Hark] All right.

328
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:18,165
Think Hark could
let Tonya come over?

329
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:20,250
Bang your skanky
girlfriend somewhere else.

330
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,503
[Blaze laughs]

331
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:26,091
We just need the room for
like, I don't know, two hours.

332
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:29,344
- 30 minutes.
- You jealous?

333
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:31,346
Oh, you caught me.

334
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:34,432
Actually, you better not
be bringing anyone over here.

335
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,600
Trust me, talking to
the guys around here

336
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:38,603
is all the birth control I need.

337
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,145
Good 'cause I'd kill them.

338
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:46,319
All right, man,
looking nice, oh.

339
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:52,701
I'm thinking about opening a
bank account for the money,

340
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:53,951
what do you think?

341
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,494
Whatever you want, Blaze.

342
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,416
All right, an hour, just
an hour, that's all I need.

343
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:04,336
[Blaze hums]

344
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,182
[Hark] So, what
do you know about

345
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,893
what you're bringing in?

346
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,479
[Blaze] We get paid
for it, that's about it.

347
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,147
[Hark] Yeah, okay.

348
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:24,190
You need to know a
little more than that.

349
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:26,735
[Blaze] All right.

350
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:28,153
[Hark] Those overseas
buyers always want copper.

351
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,361
Best kind is electrical wires,

352
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:30,989
if you're lucky
enough to find it.

353
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:34,867
Look over here we got
iron and aluminum.

354
00:25:38,747 --> 00:25:39,788
They look the same.

355
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,375
Feel that.

356
00:25:44,085 --> 00:25:44,919
Here feel that.

357
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,921
Which one's heavier?

358
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,258
- This one.
- Okay, iron.

359
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:53,720
So, iron's heavier than
aluminum, all right?

360
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:58,767
This, this is brass, okay.

361
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:03,688
How do you know it's brass,
it's got yellow in it.

362
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,230
Okay.

363
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:08,400
This, [chuckles]
this is the good shit.

364
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,612
People Jones for this.

365
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:15,240
Copper equals money, okay.

366
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:22,582
Feels good, huh?

367
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:28,213
So, how long these guys
been working for you?

368
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,130
Well, Pudge came
in after Tigerboy.

369
00:26:30,173 --> 00:26:31,298
- Yeah.
- I mean,

370
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,550
Tigerboy, they're
scrapping just like you.

371
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:35,053
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

372
00:26:35,095 --> 00:26:37,889
This is the bailer, it's the
heart of the yard right here.

373
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:39,723
- Okay.
- And as long

374
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:41,810
as this thing's running,
we're in business.

375
00:26:41,851 --> 00:26:43,395
All right.

376
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,605
[Man] Hark, get your
scrawny ass over here!

377
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:52,444
Why don't you get her
working on the stainless steel

378
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:54,906
and I'll take you
to the way station

379
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:56,240
when the buyer comes in.

380
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,282
You're in good hands.

381
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,747
All right, so this is
really simple, actually,

382
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,289
let me see your hands.

383
00:27:04,332 --> 00:27:05,917
You're gonna take your right
one and you're gonna put it

384
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:08,128
on this grip and
with your left one,

385
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:09,629
you're gonna have your
thumb over the top

386
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:11,631
and all your other
fingers on the bottom.

387
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:14,134
So, like this.

388
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,926
And you're gonna feel a
little lever down there,

389
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:17,761
you wanna press that
little lever down

390
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:20,473
and then you wanna squeeze
and that should turn it on.

391
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:27,022
Yep, just like that.

392
00:27:30,817 --> 00:27:33,819
[machinery running]

393
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:08,855
[machinery running]

394
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:39,052
Hey, Hey!

395
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,480
Don't touch the bailer.

396
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,696
So, what can I
do for you, Lee?

397
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:00,365
I need some copper,
Hark, some steel

398
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:02,032
and you got any red brass?

399
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:04,702
Copper's low, it's
been low all year.

400
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,579
Okay, I see you got
some new help around here.

401
00:29:07,622 --> 00:29:11,375
Business is booming,
you know, what can I say?

402
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:13,210
Nice, nice, all right,
well then in that case

403
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,547
I need 1,000 pounds of steel.

404
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,715
- 60 cents.
- All right

405
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:20,134
and 700 pounds of
number one wire.

406
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:23,762
- Three dollars.
- Three, I can get it

407
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:25,432
for two bucks down
the road, come on.

408
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,057
Okay, I'm gonna tell you $2.50

409
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,642
and you're gonna say okay.

410
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:30,394
You know why, because unlike
the guys down the road,

411
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:34,565
I don't mix number
ones and number twos.

412
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,067
- I'll give you $2.25.
- $2.50, Lee,

413
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,484
or you can tell
your boss from China

414
00:29:37,527 --> 00:29:40,238
that my good buddies
from Hong Kong

415
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,281
are gonna get the
last bit of copper.

416
00:29:42,323 --> 00:29:44,117
They're coming by
here soon too, so.

417
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,912
[Lee] Fine, but I want
more copper next month.

418
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:49,621
[Hark] Good, that's why
you're my favorite buyer.

419
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:50,581
[Lee] Yeah.

420
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:51,665
[Hark] Okay, load them up!

421
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:55,920
Here, add this to the list.

422
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,838
[Hark] Price for $2.50
is a good deal, trust me.

423
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:08,265
No, she's good-

424
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:11,978
- Total's wrong, you
forgot to carry the one.

425
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,146
You're off $5,000.

426
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:19,277
Blaze, why don't you take
Lee outside for a second.

427
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,945
I'll be out there in a second.

428
00:30:21,988 --> 00:30:23,490
[Lee] All right.

429
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:28,369
Why don't you fix it.

430
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:31,081
That's good work.

431
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:40,339
[slow music]

432
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:12,204
[Ruth sighs]

433
00:31:14,582 --> 00:31:17,544
So, what did you think?

434
00:31:17,585 --> 00:31:19,336
Man, it's something.

435
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,005
[Hark] Yeah, yeah.

436
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:25,300
Hey, how did you get to running
your own business anyway?

437
00:31:26,428 --> 00:31:30,765
Well, I was in the
Marines for a few years

438
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:34,351
and I came back and it was
kind of hard to find a job.

439
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:35,353
Right.

440
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:37,187
So, I went down to Mexico

441
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,857
and that's where all
the jobs are going.

442
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:43,861
So, I'm down there, get a call
saying hey, we got a position

443
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:46,614
for you, $8.50 an
hour making cabinets.

444
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:51,618
Come back here, then
those jobs go overseas.

445
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:54,413
Then I joined up
with a scrap crew,

446
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:57,041
see how much they're raking in

447
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:59,419
and I learned the
business real quick.

448
00:31:59,461 --> 00:32:02,047
I broke off, decided
to hire my own people.

449
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:04,257
You didn't go to college.

450
00:32:04,298 --> 00:32:05,424
[Hark laughs]

451
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:06,301
No.

452
00:32:07,594 --> 00:32:09,763
I mean, probably thought

453
00:32:09,804 --> 00:32:12,807
of doing something
else though, right?

454
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:17,854
I mean, like lawyer or music
or police or something.

455
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:21,107
What, be a broke musician?

456
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:22,566
Let me tell you something,
hey let me tell you something,

457
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:25,403
listen to this, the police
when my buyers come into town,

458
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:26,612
they take them out to dinner.

459
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,323
I don't know, it just
sounds nice to get out

460
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:30,157
and see how the rest of
the world works is all.

461
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,576
You get a front row seat
to how the world works,

462
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:34,745
I don't need no professor
of sociology quizzing me

463
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:37,499
on life below the poverty line.

464
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:39,834
Well, maybe if
I'd gone to college,

465
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:41,795
I wouldn't live below
the poverty line.

466
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:45,923
Look, what I do,
it's not glamorous,

467
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,341
there's not some kid going,

468
00:32:47,384 --> 00:32:50,095
hey, I wanna own a scrap
metal yard when I get older,

469
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,762
it's fucking hard work.

470
00:32:51,805 --> 00:32:54,932
And you know, if you work hard

471
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:58,352
then maybe one day you
can own a house like me,

472
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:00,689
you know, you too.

473
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:01,940
[Blaze] No, she's
too smart for that.

474
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,273
No, she's smarter
here, trust me.

475
00:33:03,316 --> 00:33:04,651
What does that mean?

476
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:07,194
It means here at least
you can see the top.

477
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:11,783
[Man] Yo, Hark get in
here, it's your turn.

478
00:33:11,825 --> 00:33:12,784
Look, why don't you
guys get yourself a beer

479
00:33:12,826 --> 00:33:14,160
and come out and
play some games.

480
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:15,036
All right.

481
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:22,334
Get up.

482
00:33:26,756 --> 00:33:28,298
[Blaze] There's still conduit
all over the place

483
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:31,301
and there's copper
in that conduit.

484
00:33:31,344 --> 00:33:34,346
Move fast, follow the wires.

485
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:58,203
Look out for other scrappers.

486
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:05,377
[dramatic music]

487
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,712
Stay with me.

488
00:34:09,215 --> 00:34:11,885
[ominous music]

489
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:36,909
Hark, get the steel doors.

490
00:34:38,327 --> 00:34:40,538
Here, let's take a look around.

491
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,373
Well, what are
we supposed to do?

492
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:44,708
[laughs] I'm sure
you'll figure it out.

493
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:46,544
Let's figure it out.

494
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:47,461
[Hark] Help me with these.

495
00:35:04,646 --> 00:35:06,773
Ruth, over here.

496
00:35:06,815 --> 00:35:08,191
Get the grinder.

497
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,820
- Are you gonna cut it?
- Yeah, start here,

498
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,445
- stop right there.
- Here?

499
00:35:13,487 --> 00:35:14,279
Yeah.

500
00:35:14,322 --> 00:35:17,325
[machinery running]

501
00:35:18,284 --> 00:35:19,119
Careful.

502
00:35:32,632 --> 00:35:37,470
All right, I'm gonna run
this back to the truck,

503
00:35:38,972 --> 00:35:39,806
- are you good here?
- Yeah.

504
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:40,681
- Stay here?
- Yes.

505
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:43,601
- Is that it?
- Yep.

506
00:35:43,643 --> 00:35:45,311
[Blaze] All right.

507
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:09,836
[dramatic music]

508
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:43,202
[ceiling crashing]

509
00:37:21,449 --> 00:37:22,282
Wow.

510
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:29,748
I told you there were more
than cans and bottles.

511
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,596
[dramatic music]

512
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:53,230
[Woman On Radio] I didn't
even know what an engineer was.

513
00:37:53,273 --> 00:37:55,233
All I knew is that I was curiou

514
00:37:55,275 --> 00:37:58,278
and math and problem
solving were fun for me.

515
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:00,487
By the time I arrived
at college I learned

516
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:03,074
that it was the engineers
who had those same skills

517
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:05,744
and were solving
things, important things

518
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:08,829
like global warming and
medical breakthroughs.

519
00:38:08,871 --> 00:38:10,414
But I was the only
girl in the class

Overtime.

872
01:06:56,349 --> 01:06:58,059
There's a training
program in town.

873
01:06:59,018 --> 01:07:00,310
We can do that together

874
01:07:00,353 --> 01:07:01,646
or we can ride there
together everyday.

875
01:07:01,688 --> 01:07:03,773
I'm not smart like you, okay?

876
01:07:06,735 --> 01:07:08,028
I mean, I didn't
finish my senior year

877
01:07:08,068 --> 01:07:09,862
'cause somebody had
to take care of you

878
01:07:09,903 --> 01:07:13,867
and now I'm here
and I don't know.

879
01:07:21,248 --> 01:07:25,586
Why don't you leave, Ruth,
just take my keys and go?

880
01:07:28,547 --> 01:07:30,883
I don't leave because
I don't wanna leave you.

881
01:07:40,143 --> 01:07:41,394
[President Trump] We want every child
in America to have the opportunity

882
01:07:41,436 --> 01:07:44,689

883
01:07:44,731 --> 01:07:47,859
'Cause we can never lose
sight of the connection-

884
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:50,861
- There's a prison guard
position over in Mansfield.

885
01:07:50,903 --> 01:07:52,530
Where the hell is Mansfield?

886
01:07:52,572 --> 01:07:55,867
- Don't you have a pension?
- Well, sure I do.

887
01:07:55,909 --> 01:07:58,912
- Then retire.
- I wanna work.

888
01:08:01,246 --> 01:08:03,875
[Ruth] What do you know
about the other scrap crews?

889
01:08:03,916 --> 01:08:04,833
I don't.

890
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:09,088
Well do you know
where I can find them?

891
01:08:10,297 --> 01:08:11,799
No, Hark is bad enough,

892
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,550
a girl like you doesn't need

893
01:08:13,592 --> 01:08:15,052
to be running around
with them men.

894
01:08:15,094 --> 01:08:16,887
I mean, you know,
I'm not slow, honey,

895
01:08:16,930 --> 01:08:18,765
I know what you've been doing.

896
01:08:18,806 --> 01:08:21,100
I can't scrap it by myself.

897
01:08:21,141 --> 01:08:25,979
All right, listen to me,
Blaze has his hands full

898
01:08:26,021 --> 01:08:27,231
with your mom, he doesn't-

899
01:08:27,273 --> 01:08:30,944
- My mom is a junkie,
that was her choice,

900
01:08:30,984 --> 01:08:32,237
it was not gonna be mine.

901
01:08:32,278 --> 01:08:33,988
It's not a choice.

902
01:08:34,029 --> 01:08:36,073
When your mom hurt
her hand on the job,

903
01:08:36,115 --> 01:08:38,743
she couldn't find
work anywhere else.

904
01:08:38,784 --> 01:08:41,954
She was a hard worker.

905
01:08:41,996 --> 01:08:44,791
That damn doctor kept
prescribing her pain pills.

906
01:08:44,832 --> 01:08:48,627
You gonna help
me scrap it or not?

Yeah.

917
01:12:17,503 --> 01:12:20,673
Hey, why weren't
you at work today!

918
01:12:23,009 --> 01:12:24,469
Hey, man, I don't want
any trouble, all right,

919
01:12:24,511 --> 01:12:25,720
I'm just checking on my sister.

920
01:12:25,761 --> 01:12:27,680
Oh, you don't
want any trouble?

921
01:12:27,721 --> 01:12:29,849
You know Lee called
me and told me

922
01:12:29,890 --> 01:12:33,519
that your sister is
selling him sheet metal.

923
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:34,520
Did you know that?

924
01:12:35,689 --> 01:12:37,524
I don't know anything
about that, all right.

925
01:12:37,564 --> 01:12:39,067
I don't want any trouble.

926
01:12:39,109 --> 01:12:40,485
No, I know, I know, you
already fucking said that,

927
01:12:40,527 --> 01:12:42,153
so I'm gonna ask
again where is she?

928
01:12:42,194 --> 01:12:43,654
It's just me, man.

929
01:12:43,697 --> 01:12:45,198
When I find her,
I'll let you know.

930
01:12:45,239 --> 01:12:46,907
Don't you fucking
walk away from me.

931
01:12:46,949 --> 01:12:50,537
I'm gonna ask you again,
where is your sister?

932
01:12:50,578 --> 01:12:53,164
I literally just got
here, Hark, all right?

933
01:12:53,206 --> 01:12:55,500
Okay, did you know
someone came into my office?

934
01:12:55,542 --> 01:12:56,710
Did you know that?

935
01:12:56,751 --> 01:12:58,211
I wasn't in your
fucking office, man.

936
01:12:58,252 --> 01:13:00,255
You know, I bring you
guys on, I bring you money.

937
01:13:00,296 --> 01:13:02,048
Someone died on
your watch, Hark,

938
01:13:03,882 --> 01:13:05,050
it could have been
any one of us.

939
01:13:10,055 --> 01:13:15,060
Okay, I'm done, okay,
that's everything I made

940
01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:17,188
in the last two weeks.

941
01:13:17,229 --> 01:13:18,397
Get that out of my face,

942
01:13:18,439 --> 01:13:19,398
don't fucking put
that in my face.

943
01:13:21,734 --> 01:13:25,738
- I'm fucking done man.

Right to the sofa,
come on, baby.

948

Oh shit, all right, all right,
careful, careful, careful.

949
01:14:03,359 --> 01:14:05,737
- Let me get a towel.
- Let me lift your legs.

950
01:14:05,779 --> 01:14:06,905
Shit.

951
01:14:06,945 --> 01:14:09,448
Go get me some washcloths.

952
01:14:14,787 --> 01:14:15,621
Hurry, sweetie.

I got them.

957
01:14:35,809 --> 01:14:37,686
- Keep cleaning him up.
- Okay.

958
01:14:41,021 --> 01:14:42,981
[Linda] I need to
report an assault.

959
01:14:44,818 --> 01:14:46,360
Yeah, it's my best friend's son

960
01:14:46,403 --> 01:14:48,905
I found him in the back
alley, beat up pretty bad.

961
01:14:50,073 --> 01:14:53,410
Okay, okay, I'll meet
you at the hospital.

don't know who did it

but I know who did it, so
they must know who did it,

But I will come
back tomorrow, okay?

- How dare you.

976
01:18:06,185 --> 01:18:07,644
All right, Rhonda,
you don't need

977
01:18:07,686 --> 01:18:09,146
to talk to her like that.

978
01:18:09,189 --> 01:18:11,149
Linda, this is
a family matter.

979
01:18:11,190 --> 01:18:12,983
Yeah, and I'm about the
only family you got left

980
01:18:13,025 --> 01:18:14,818
so shut up.

981
01:18:14,860 --> 01:18:17,029
If you can't find it
in you to be decent

982
01:18:17,072 --> 01:18:18,323
to your daughter right now,

983
01:18:18,364 --> 01:18:20,032
I'm not gonna come
visit you anymore.

984
01:18:20,908 --> 01:18:21,742
Bye.

985
01:18:24,871 --> 01:18:25,872
Thanks for the picture.

986
01:18:49,561 --> 01:18:51,064
They won't let me visit him.

987
01:19:17,423 --> 01:19:18,257
Mom.

988
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:24,681

You're really not gonna go
back inside and see her?

Make her sweat
it out a little.

992
01:20:00,632 --> 01:20:03,886
- You need a ride?
- No, I'm good.

993
01:20:07,222 --> 01:20:08,057

said you stopped by.

An apartment next
to Tonya opened up,

I told her we'll check
it out next week.

1011
01:22:11,597 --> 01:22:13,307
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1012
01:22:13,350 --> 01:22:14,517
That's good.

1013
01:22:16,810 --> 01:22:21,065
- You want applesauce?
- You want me to feed you?

1014
01:22:21,106 --> 01:22:22,734
