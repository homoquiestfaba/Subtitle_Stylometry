1
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,247
- So it's late Friday night,

2
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:17,583
and we're somewhere up
on queen Anne right now.

3
00:00:17,585 --> 00:00:19,785
We followed a guy
who we've been following

4
00:00:19,787 --> 00:00:21,320
for an hour and a half
on the track.

5
00:00:21,322 --> 00:00:23,022
He's just been
tracing the track,

6
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:26,091
looking for girls to pick up
to buy them for sex.

7
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:28,494
He's parked over here
on this block.

8
00:00:28,496 --> 00:00:30,529
So we're gonna go
confront him right now.

9
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,231
And we're gonna tell him,

10
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:33,599
"hey, it's not right
what you're doing.

11
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:35,567
You can't do this here
in our city."

12
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:37,202
I'm not sure
how this is gonna go.

13
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,171
These guys usually
don't react very well

14
00:00:39,173 --> 00:00:40,339
with this type of thing.

15
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:41,507
[car horn honks]

16
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:43,409
What are you doing?

17
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:45,477
- None of your fucking business.
- Oh, it's my business now.

18
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,146
You made a big mistake.

19
00:00:47,148 --> 00:00:50,249
You made
a big mistake.

20
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:52,151
Let's get in the car.

21
00:00:52,153 --> 00:00:57,790
- He can't get out.

22
00:00:57,792 --> 00:01:00,559
[tires screech]

23
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,294
[crash]

24
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:03,796
- Get this side.

25
00:01:03,798 --> 00:01:07,399
- Hey! What do you think
you're doing, huh?

26
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,068
Get that.
Get their license plate.

27
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,769
Get their license plate.

28
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:13,172
He's up on the right.
He's up on the right.

29
00:01:13,174 --> 00:01:14,173
- Is that him?

30
00:01:14,175 --> 00:01:16,608
- Yep.
He saw us.

31
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:17,609
- Right there?

32
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:19,178
That's him?

33
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,814
- Hey, what the fuck
is your problem, dude?

34
00:01:21,816 --> 00:01:23,749
- Let me tell you my problem.
- What's your fucking problem?

35
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:24,750
- LET ME TELL YOU MY PROBLEM.
[horn blares]

36
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:26,385
[indistinct arguing]

37
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:40,165
- So often
when I hear people say, glibly,

38
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:42,768
"prostitution is the oldest
profession"...

39
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,605
Now, look,
agriculture, fishing,

40
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,674
hunting is the oldest
profession,

41
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:51,276
but prostitution is not
the oldest profession.

42
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:54,313
It is really the oldest
oppression of women

43
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:55,581
on the planet.

44
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,549
It has always been that way,

45
00:01:57,551 --> 00:01:59,485
and it will always
be that way.

46
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:04,756
- Men are the issue
that has to be addressed.

47
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:10,562
It is the demand side
that is the issue.

48
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:13,265
- I don't... I don't want
to hurt people,

49
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:14,800
but there's a part of me
inside that does.

50
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,468
That's the horrible thing.

51
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,871
Like, it's somewhere inside
that just...

52
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:22,608
Just only wants
to feed itself.

53
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:31,517
- In this country,
we pride ourselves on the fact

54
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,352
that we're a free country.

55
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:37,356
And in fact, our constitution
was founded upon that principle.

56
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:39,725
And yet, the sad reality is,

57
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:42,895
the irony is that we have slaves
in the United States.

58
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:45,230
- It comes as a shock to a lot
of Americans

59
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:47,766
that in their own community,
in their own cities,

60
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:51,270
that young people as young
as 12, 13, 14 years old,

61
00:02:51,272 --> 00:02:54,406
boys and girls, are being
forced to sell their bodies

62
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:56,341
for the profit
of someone else.

63
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,443
They're brought from cities
around the United States

64
00:02:58,445 --> 00:02:59,878
and they're brought
from around the world

65
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,881
to satisfy the appetites
of individuals

66
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:05,817
who have no compassion
or concern for the future

67
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:10,689
and life of a young person.

68
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:14,293
- The most common area
of sex trafficking that we see

69
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:16,728
is prostitution-related
activities.

70
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:20,933
- Rape and prostitution
are flip sides of the same coin,

71
00:03:20,935 --> 00:03:24,636
and that is the sexual
oppression of women.

72
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:27,306
- That's slavery.
You may not see the manacles,

73
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:29,808
you may not see that somehow
that they are being

74
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,543
locked and keyed away,

75
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,745
but they are being held
against their will, intimidated,

76
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:36,415
and also being used
in a such a way

77
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:39,451
that they have no freedom
to pursue their own destiny.

78
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,653
- Nobody really likes
to think

79
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:45,224
that there are children
being sold for sex.

80
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:46,992
It's a very hard issue
to talk about.

81
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:48,660
It's a very hard thing
to recognize

82
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,462
that it might be something
that's occurring

83
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:53,232
in one's own community.

84
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:57,402
- Kids are captured
and forced into street

85
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,004
and Internet prostitution.

86
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:02,241
And we need to set
a new norm in our city

87
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:04,743
and in our country that
that's just a line

88
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,279
we are not gonna allow people
to step over.

89
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:09,448
- If we're looking at
prostitution

90
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,016
in Seattle, Washington,

91
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:13,585
what we're looking at
is the average girl

92
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:18,724
begins turning tricks
when she's 13 years of age.

93
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:22,461
- And we commissioned a cultural
anthropologist, Debra boyer,

94
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:25,564
who wrote a paper, a white paper
called "who pays the price?"

95
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:28,834
And she estimates there's
anywhere from 300 to 500 girls

96
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:30,769
just in the greater Seattle
metropolitan area

97
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:34,539
out at any given time involved
in the sex trade.

98
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,342
- We could, in a very short
period of time,

99
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:40,345
put names to 238 young people

100
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:42,281
who were involved
in prostitution.

101
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:46,585
The police tell me that
that is also an underestimate.

102
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,489
- We live in a culture now

103
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:54,426
where many fourth and fifth
graders talk about sexuality,

104
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:56,795
know about sexuality.

105
00:04:56,797 --> 00:05:00,332
There's an indication that
by third or fourth grade,

106
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:03,602
20% have experienced oral sex.

107
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:07,406
So we live in a vastly
sexualized culture

108
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:11,009
where Parisian young women
at age 10

109
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:12,878
ARE ON <i>VOGUE</i> MAGAZINE,

110
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,681
in a display that can only...

111
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:17,649
I mean, to use the word
coquettish

112
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,885
is a profound misuse
of language.

113
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:23,689
It is a profoundly
sexualized world.

114
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:27,526
So we, as a world around us,

115
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:30,529
have, in some senses
of the phrase,

116
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:33,065
a certain pedophilic drift.

117
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:51,550
- What it was like growing up
was my dad was in the military.

118
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:57,389
My dad was, um, uh...
Let's see.

119
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:59,725
He was...
He had a good heart,

120
00:05:59,727 --> 00:06:02,728
but when he drank,
he was a monster.

121
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:06,865
I still have nightmares
about this man

122
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,568
with a good heart that played
with kids and stuff like

123
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:13,739
that just contorting
into a monster.

124
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:15,974
He started sexually
doing things to me

125
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:17,809
when I was four years old.

126
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:22,047
And he was giving me a bath,
and he inserted his fingers.

127
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:25,617
And I went out
to tell my mom because,

128
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:28,620
three or four years old, you
just say everything, you know.

129
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:33,091
And he backhanded me, and my
teeth went through my lip.

130
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:35,794
And I remember picking my lip
up off my teeth

131
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:37,429
and thinking I was gonna die

132
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:38,797
because your
lip isn't supposed to be

133
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:40,599
on your teeth, you know.

134
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:46,972
But it was like a real solid
way of telling me,

135
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:49,608
"don't talk."

136
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:55,547
My mom would lock me
in my room, and so long

137
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:58,984
that I thought she forgot
that I... she had a little girl.

138
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:02,554
And I would draw pictures
of a mom and a little girl,

139
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:04,089
you know, just these little
stick figures.

140
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:06,091
Well, actually, mine
were little round snowman

141
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,926
kind of figures, you know.

142
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,995
And I would slide them
under the door

143
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:13,098
because she would
have to pass by my bedroom

144
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,766
to go into the bathroom.

145
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,835
And it was like
I couldn't write words,

146
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:20,739
so I was, like, screaming on
paper, "let me out."

147
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:35,053
On my ninth birthday,
I was really excited

148
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:39,691
because it was one of the first
times that I felt like

149
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:41,626
I was gonna be celebrated
that day.

150
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,128
I wasn't a kid who normally
had a lot of birthday parties,

151
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,096
or really any at all.

152
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:48,834
I don't think I'd had much of
anything up to that point.

153
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:51,570
But my mother told me
that she was throwing me

154
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:52,871
a birthday party.

155
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:55,173
And it was kind of a neat
experience.

156
00:07:55,175 --> 00:08:00,545
It just seemed
like Disneyland to me.

157
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:04,783
Eventually, all the kids
were gone,

158
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:11,556
and my mother and my father

159
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:13,959
were just talking
to a bunch of guys.

160
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:19,231
They took me and said
there was someone

161
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:22,100
in my brother's bedroom that...
My brothers old bedroom...

162
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:23,201
That they wanted me
to meet

163
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:25,904
that had something for me.

164
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:28,039
And so I was thinking,
okay, a birthday present,

165
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,609
like, you know...

166
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:31,977
They led me into his room,

167
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:34,746
and just super quick

168
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:37,816
they shut the door and left.

169
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:42,687
And he just
smiled really big and...

170
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,990
Said, "hey, Happy Birthday.
I've got something for you."

171
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:48,760
And just started grabbing on me
and wouldn't let me go.

172
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:52,197
And...

173
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:55,000
I was crying and confused
and kept trying to push away.

174
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:58,303
And...

175
00:08:58,305 --> 00:09:02,274
I just... I couldn't...
I couldn't get away.

176
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:05,577
Um...

177
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:08,947
He raped me

178
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:15,921
and then brought
the other men in,

179
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:20,592
and they took turns,
and just kept raping me.

180
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,029
I was seven
when my father raped me,

181
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:26,264
and then two years later,
I was nine,

182
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:29,267
and that was the first time
that I was sold for sex.

183
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,342
- When we talk about
sexual abuse,

184
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:39,344
the essence of it is this:

185
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:43,815
It is the misuse of another
person's helplessness

186
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:46,284
for the other person's
sexual pleasure.

187
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:48,219
So it's always,
first and foremost,

188
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:49,888
about an issue of power.

189
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,323
- 90-plus percent
of young people

190
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:55,026
who are in
"commercial prostitution"

191
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:56,928
have been sexually abused.

192
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,731
At what point are you
given a choice?

193
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:03,668
- Very few women end up,
around the world,

194
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,237
in what we call prostitution

195
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:09,674
without a history
of prior sexual harm.

196
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:13,111
[electronic bleep]

197
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:17,782
[electronic bleep]

198
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,318
- I'm going to crestview west
apartments.

199
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:23,021
Okay.

200
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,828
[indistinct chatter]

201
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,063
- So face the car?
- Yeah, face the car.

202
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,198
- You got any weapons on you?

203
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,199
- No, I don't.

204
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:35,634
- Nothing sharp, right?

205
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:38,670
- Hi, harmony,
can you let me know

206
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:40,238
of your availability today

207
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,807
and in-call location
in bellevue?

208
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,743
- Okay, are you, uh...

209
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,952
- But you are in a pimp
situation right now, aren't you?

210
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:31,189
Okay.
Is it violent?

211
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:34,793
How long you been
in that situation?

212
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:36,094
Three months?

213
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:37,395
You like that situation

214
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:41,066
or kind of want to get away
from it?

215
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:42,734
Okay.

216
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:44,869
So do you have a little fear

217
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:48,173
about turning on your pimp
right now?

218
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:50,475
Is that what it is?
- Yeah.

219
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:52,711
- Like he'd come after you?

220
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:01,019
- When we are talking about
sex trafficking

221
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:03,154
and sex slavery,

222
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:04,889
we are talking
about the commercial

223
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,092
sexual exploitation of people,

224
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:10,361
whether they are minors
or whether they are adults.

225
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:13,131
- Anyone who's forced into
prostitution is a victim.

226
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:16,067
And I believe that's most
of the people in the sex trade.

227
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,303
I think there are
very few volunteers.

228
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:20,205
So whether she's being
coerced into it

229
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:23,241
at the age of 24 or the age
of 14 is immaterial.

230
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,810
Coercion is coercion.
Rape is rape.

231
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:30,482
- So right now,
we've left the track,

232
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:33,985
which was dead, and we're now
on aurora Avenue.

233
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:36,454
We're on the 8200 block
of aurora heading north

234
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:39,524
to the city limits,
which is 145th.

235
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:41,760
We're gonna be
looking around here

236
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:47,065
for possible street prostitution
occurring.

237
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,236
- Here we go.

238
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:03,948
- Hello.

239
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,016
- Hello.
Me and my buddy here...

240
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:06,484
- Hi.
- Hi.

241
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:07,886
- We're just... what we're
trying to do is...

242
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:09,387
- Thank you
for telling me that.

243
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:11,022
- No problem.
- 'Cause I would have freaked.

244
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:12,290
- Yeah, yeah.
What we're trying to do is...

245
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,424
- Can we drive
and get out of here?

246
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:14,926
- Absolutely.
- Are you a cop?

247
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:16,795
- No, no, no.
What we're trying to do

248
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:17,962
is we're trying to hook up
our buddy on a bachelor party.

249
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,497
- Okay.
- So are you willing to...

250
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,399
I mean, we got a room
at the westin.

251
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:22,834
- Okay.
- Our buddy's down...

252
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:24,335
We got a bunch of guys
down there,

253
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:25,503
and we're looking for a girl.
- Okay, and...

254
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:27,071
- I... okay.
Go ahead.

255
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:29,140
- Can I see your dick?

256
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,276
- No, you ain't gonna
see my dick right here.

257
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:33,511
I'm not gonna show my dick
in front of my buddy here.

258
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,446
- Okay, well, can you show me
yours, since he's your friend?

259
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:37,248
- I'm not gonna
do that either.

260
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,518
- Well, cops don't show me...
Show you their dicks.

261
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,220
So...

262
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,897
- How did you get involved
in this?

263
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:54,365
- Pimp.
- Pimp?

264
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:56,201
- I ran into a pimp
when I was 12 years old.

265
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:57,402
- From where?
- From Washington.

266
00:13:57,404 --> 00:13:58,403
- Where you from?

267
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:00,271
- I am from Eugene, Oregon.

268
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:02,340
I was a ward of the court
in Tacoma.

269
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,275
He was 34.

270
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:06,444
- He was 34,
and you were 12 years old?

271
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:08,012
- Yeah, I was 12,
and I literally

272
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,447
ran away from home
with my Teddy bear.

273
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:11,015
And two months later...
- Let's get out of here.

274
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,251
- And two months later,
I was on the street.

275
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:18,623
- "Oh, baby, oh, baby,
I love you."

276
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,258
- I thought
I was in love with him,

277
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,926
and, "baby,
you'll do anything for me,

278
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:25,163
but you just
have to talk to this guy."

279
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:27,465
I mean, at first it wasn't,
"go suck his dick."

280
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,467
It was, "just go talk
to this guy."

281
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,569
And then, "oh, man,
we can get $100 more.

282
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:33,504
That'll pay for the room
for a half a week."

283
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:35,473
And it just...
It gradually happened.

284
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:37,008
I mean, gradually, well,

285
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,476
it was only over like
a week and a half

286
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:40,879
before I was full fledged.
- Did he ever beat you?

287
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:42,347
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

288
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:44,249
- You don't make enough money,
you get hit.

289
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:45,950
- How much were you expected
to bring in a night?

290
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:47,218
- It depended
on where we were

291
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,519
and if it was
a weekday or not.

292
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:51,055
$600 and up was basically
my minimum.

293
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:11,075
My body is so to where

294
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,544
I don't even have
any more muscle anymore.

295
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:17,215
I mean, my hips are so hard
to where it's...

296
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:18,549
I... it's time.

297
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:20,251
It's time.

298
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,986
I mean, I'm surprised
I'm still breathing

299
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:25,290
because my circulation is
so bad that...

300
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:28,059
I mean, how does the blood
get through when you have,

301
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:30,094
like, rocks, you know?

302
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,430
My fat cells are like rocks
up against each other.

303
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:35,566
It's like all cartilage now,
you know?

304
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:37,602
- And you're 33?
- And I'm 33.

305
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,570
And I guarantee you,
if you put

306
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:42,941
a 70-something-year-old woman's
body up against mine,

307
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:45,643
she's gonna be
in better health than I am.

308
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:51,416
- There's not a good pimp.

309
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:53,718
These guys are the best
psychologists in the community.

310
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,187
There's not one of them
that doesn't use coercion

311
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:59,123
to keep these kids in,
not one.

312
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,192
- Whether it's
their friends online

313
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:03,328
or somebody they meet
on the bus

314
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:06,297
or somebody who they meet
at the mall,

315
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,000
often times the victims,
the girls will refer to them

316
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:10,068
as their boyfriends.

317
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:26,584
- The psychological warfare
that they use to shape the girls

318
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:29,687
into, you know,
their working girls, is...

319
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:32,223
It's... I hate to say it, but it's
actually kind of impressive.

320
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:35,393
It's almost like you wonder if
somebody read a book somewhere.

321
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:37,195
Because they do all the right
stuff to make the girl

322
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:40,064
not only do
horrible things for them,

323
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:42,567
but fall in love with them.

324
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:44,035
- I think of these pimps,

325
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:46,104
I just... no other...

326
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:48,139
The best word to describe
them in my mind

327
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:50,141
is they're psychopaths.

328
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:55,713
It's just they have no empathy
for what these girls go through.

329
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:59,117
These girls are strictly money
for them.

330
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:33,684
- Stop the car!
Don't turn on the car!

331
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:35,286
Don't turn on the car.

332
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:36,421
- Step out, sir.

333
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,727
- Step out of the car.
Sheriff's office.

334
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,562
Pull your pants up.

335
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,497
Get out of the car.

336
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:51,369
- Go ahead and button up,
and then face the car.

337
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:53,304
- Okay.

338
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:07,185
- Get to the voice mail.
I'm wanna look at her pictures.

339
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:09,320
Is that her?
Yeah, that's her.

340
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:11,522
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

341
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:20,198
[pop song ringtone]

342
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:26,504
- Yo!
He hung up.

343
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:27,839
He probably thought he called
the wrong number.

344
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:29,373
- [laughs] OH!
HE'LL CALL BACK.

345
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:32,810
- Hello?

346
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:35,580
Who is this?
Cat got your tongue?

347
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,851
He hung up.

348
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:45,623
- He's lighting them up
westbound,

349
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,892
heading towards the laundromat.

350
00:18:47,894 --> 00:18:49,660
Northbound.

351
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,611
- Hey.

352
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:10,515
- What are we doing?

353
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:15,853
- He damaged his phone,
so we can't check it out.

354
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:19,257
Pretty smart, man.

355
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:22,426
Why did you tear your phone
apart?

356
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:25,897
No. Why did you tear
your phone apart?

357
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:28,232
Can you answer me?

358
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:29,567
- What did I do wrong?

359
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:31,435
- Why did you
take your phone apart?

360
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:32,803
- What did I do wrong?

361
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:34,539
- You pimping.
- No, I'm not.

362
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,641
- That's what you did wrong.
- No, I'm not.

363
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:38,276
- Your girl's singing
like a bird, dog.

364
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:39,877
- No, I...
- Your girl is.

365
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:41,679
So she lying on you?
- You're crazy, dude.

366
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,481
- I'm crazy?

367
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:46,417
Yo, it's funny how you act all
tough with these broads,

368
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:47,718
and y'all get a man
in your face,

369
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,754
you act like little girls.

370
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,623
- Yeah, you did.
You're a pimp.

371
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,492
I looked at all
your text messages

372
00:19:54,494 --> 00:19:57,261
to the little blonde-haired
girl.

373
00:19:57,263 --> 00:19:59,297
I looked at them all
from you,

374
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:00,932
telling her to get out there
and make your money.

375
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:02,934
- Oh, come on now.
- "Daddy."

376
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:05,703
I'm gonna let cps know to take
your daughters away from you

377
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:08,839
'cause I don't trust pimps
around little girls.

378
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:10,208
Yes, you are.

379
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:34,465
- I worked down on Denny way
for a couple days

380
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:36,801
and got surrounded
by all the pimps in Seattle.

381
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:38,970
And they pretty much made me
choose up.

382
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:40,871
Told me I wasn't gonna
work down there

383
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:45,009
WITHOUT PIMPING IN MY LIFE.
[chuckles]

384
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:48,913
From, like, the time I was 14
to about the time I was 17,

385
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,915
I pretty much bounced around
from pimp to pimp

386
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:54,852
and learned the ins and out
of the streets.

387
00:20:57,356 --> 00:21:01,559
- In many ways, what a pimp
provides is a community.

388
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:03,794
A dangerous community,
but in some sense,

389
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:07,531
you create the problem,
you provide the protection.

390
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:09,800
Frankly, I think there's
a lot of insurance companies

391
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:11,969
in our world
that provide the same thing.

392
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:15,406
So the reality
of an economic structure

393
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:18,609
is we create problems,
and then we solve them.

394
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:21,979
And in many ways, a pimp
is just economically

395
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:25,716
a really bright capitalist.

396
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:27,652
- You know, how do you talk
about these men

397
00:21:27,654 --> 00:21:29,387
who have kind of raised you?

398
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:32,390
You know what I mean?
In a sick fashion.

399
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:34,892
I love the man.

400
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:37,428
I... when he gets
out of prison,

401
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,797
I can't say if I won't
at least try

402
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,433
to get a hold of him
to say hello, you know.

403
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,702
But he was the best
and worst thing

404
00:21:44,704 --> 00:21:46,604
that ever happened to me
in my life.

405
00:21:46,606 --> 00:21:48,839
- For a trafficker or a pimp
in Seattle

406
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:51,842
to have three young girls
in his stable

407
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:54,045
that he controls and manages,

408
00:21:54,047 --> 00:21:56,047
and have them go out
every night,

409
00:21:56,049 --> 00:22:02,353
he is making about $400,000
a year in non-tax money.

410
00:22:02,355 --> 00:22:04,822
Imagine if he were then
to extend to four,

411
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:07,325
to five girls,
to have multiple operations.

412
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:09,694
But it would only take
a very small operation.

413
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:10,961
It's not even a crime
right now.

414
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:12,997
It's a young pimp who says,

415
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,999
"I'm gonna manage
these three young girls."

416
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:18,402
So if we are going to address
sex trafficking,

417
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:19,904
we have to understand
that commitment

418
00:22:19,906 --> 00:22:21,572
to that kind of money.

419
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:25,576
- He has an infinite market
to whom?

420
00:22:25,578 --> 00:22:28,779
To men who are plumbers
and who are physicians

421
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:31,882
and who are judges and pastors

422
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:35,419
and the whole retinue
of people

423
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:38,522
seeking the services
of an abused woman

424
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:41,726
who has now been caught
in the trial

425
00:22:41,728 --> 00:22:45,763
of being a prostituted women.

426
00:22:45,765 --> 00:22:47,898
Let's just talk about
the real issue.

427
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,100
It's not her problem.

428
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:13,057
- And here's this cowgirl,
you know,

429
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:16,093
it's... promising
she's gonna protect me,

430
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:18,829
promising I can belong
to her family.

431
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:22,400
My family had always told me
I wasn't good enough

432
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:24,402
to belong to them,
you know.

433
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:25,970
And here's this person
telling me

434
00:23:25,972 --> 00:23:28,706
that she's gonna protect me
and teach me.

435
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:31,542
And I went with her gladly.

436
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:33,043
Gladly, you know.
Relieved.

437
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:36,113
I thought I was saved.
I thought I was rescued.

438
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:39,116
Little did I know I was
gonna be in the worst hell

439
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:40,785
I'd ever been in before.

440
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:50,861
And my first sexual encounter
was a rape.

441
00:23:50,863 --> 00:23:56,934
And after that, it was kind of
like anything goes.

442
00:23:56,936 --> 00:24:02,807
There wasn't anything precious
to hold onto anymore.

443
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:05,910
And I told her,
"I don't want to do this."

444
00:24:05,912 --> 00:24:09,814
And she beat me up real bad.

445
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:17,455
And I thought
when she beat me up,

446
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:20,691
"well, this is what people
do to me,"

447
00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:24,195
'cause my dad had done
the same thing.

448
00:24:24,197 --> 00:24:26,797
And I thought it was something
inside of me

449
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,633
that made people...
You know,

450
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:34,505
just like I was a magnet
for people's fists.

451
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:38,142
She started having men
come to the house.

452
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,177
The first one was a lawyer.

453
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:42,847
[clears throat]
AN OLDER MAN.

454
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:46,617
And he left $20 with her

455
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:49,086
and came to the back bedroom
to me.

456
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:51,188
And I did oral sex on him.

457
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,724
And one at a time.
Now it was a lawyer.

458
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:57,194
It was a policeman,
it was a judge, it was a pastor.

459
00:24:57,196 --> 00:25:01,265
A pastor that she told
I was 14 years old.

460
00:25:01,267 --> 00:25:03,868
She told him I was 14,
and he was like,

461
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:06,203
"praise the lord for this
14-year-old child,"

462
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:09,507
you know, while he's
having sex with me,

463
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:12,710
you know, licking my breasts
and things like that, you know.

464
00:25:12,712 --> 00:25:15,145
And thanking God
that he's having sex

465
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:17,748
with a girl
he thinks is 14.

466
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:26,290
My trust was pretty low then,
pretty dim.

467
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:33,731
I was tired
of being killed inside

468
00:25:33,733 --> 00:25:38,269
by my own family.

469
00:25:38,271 --> 00:25:41,205
Tired of being treated
like I didn't matter.

470
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:43,841
And there was always more
of me expected

471
00:25:43,843 --> 00:25:45,609
than I knew how to give.

472
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:50,915
At least with Connie,
I had directions.

473
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:52,750
I couldn't go back there.

474
00:25:52,752 --> 00:25:56,287
I could not go back there
anymore.

475
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:59,590
Maybe Connie
did care about me

476
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:01,258
'cause she kept telling me
she did,

477
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,295
and I'd never
heard that before.

478
00:26:04,297 --> 00:26:07,264
I was 14 years old
when my mom

479
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:12,970
touched me affectionately
the first time.

480
00:26:12,972 --> 00:26:15,039
She walked behind me,
and I was sitting on the floor,

481
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:16,774
and I was sick.

482
00:26:16,776 --> 00:26:18,742
And she patted me
on top of the head.

483
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:22,146
And I froze
because I thought,

484
00:26:22,148 --> 00:26:26,150
"that's my mom's touch."
And I...

485
00:26:26,152 --> 00:26:29,320
And I was afraid
if I walked

486
00:26:29,322 --> 00:26:33,057
that her touch would blow away
from the top of my head.

487
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:35,893
So I took my hand,
and I wiped that touch off

488
00:26:35,895 --> 00:26:39,597
and swallowed it so it
would be inside of me.

489
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,702
And no one could ever take it
away from me again.

490
00:26:44,704 --> 00:26:48,105
[sobbing]

491
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:53,010
I was so hungry to be wanted
by somebody.

492
00:26:53,012 --> 00:26:56,947
And Connie told me
she wanted me.

493
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:01,719
Somebody wanted me.

494
00:27:01,721 --> 00:27:04,355
A terrible person,
but somebody.

495
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,209
- The village voice media
is a national company

496
00:27:25,211 --> 00:27:27,811
that has a number
of subsidiary companies.

497
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:31,782
AND THOSE INCLUDE PRINT
NEWSPAPERS LIKE <i>SEATTLE WEEKLY</i>

498
00:27:31,784 --> 00:27:33,784
that are distributed
in Seattle

499
00:27:33,786 --> 00:27:35,919
and supported primarily
by advertising dollars.

500
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:37,855
They're in a number
of major markets

501
00:27:37,857 --> 00:27:39,657
around the country
with a print edition.

502
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,359
THEY ALSO HAVE AN ONLINE VERSION
OF THE <i>SEATTLE WEEKLY.</i>

503
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:46,830
And they also have something
called backpage.com,

504
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:49,733
which is their online
classified services.

505
00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:52,770
So they have print classifieds
and online classified.

506
00:27:52,772 --> 00:27:55,372
And the online
classified service

507
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:59,443
includes advertising
for escort services.

508
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:03,414
- Backpage.com charges
for posting ads online.

509
00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:07,351
And I've had
a number of cases

510
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:11,055
where the juvenile
is being posted online.

511
00:28:11,057 --> 00:28:14,391
She's selling her body
for sex online.

512
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:19,396
- Backpage.com is one
of the pages that I go to.

513
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:21,799
And I'll look.
We'll go down here.

514
00:28:21,801 --> 00:28:24,368
And, actually,
I'll go full ads.

515
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,070
And we'll just go down.

516
00:28:26,072 --> 00:28:28,072
We get on the Internet
all the time

517
00:28:28,074 --> 00:28:29,807
and just surf the web,

518
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:32,109
and look for what appears
to be underage girls.

519
00:28:32,111 --> 00:28:35,045
Now, what we'll do
is we'll contact the number,

520
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:38,215
and we'll arrange
for what we call a date.

521
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,384
And we'll either go to her,

522
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:43,253
or if she wants
to do an outcall,

523
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:46,223
we'll have to go and get
a room at a hotel.

524
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:49,393
Once they offer and agree
to the sex acts for money,

525
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:51,729
that's when we have enough
to arrest them

526
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:53,464
for the act of prostitution.

527
00:28:53,466 --> 00:28:55,833
We'll sit them down,
we'll identify them,

528
00:28:55,835 --> 00:28:58,001
find out
are they a juvenile?

529
00:28:58,003 --> 00:28:59,069
Are they an adult?

530
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,238
Like here's a girl here.

531
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,743
Doesn't look like she has a lot
of hip or waist development.

532
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:07,478
She says she's 22.

533
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,213
- Village voice media,

534
00:29:09,215 --> 00:29:12,049
THROUGH ITS SUBSIDIARY,
<i>SEATTLE WEEKLY,</i> SAID,

535
00:29:12,051 --> 00:29:14,351
"it's not really
that big a problem."

536
00:29:14,353 --> 00:29:16,253
It is a big problem.

537
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:19,490
- And, frankly, I feel
that all of this discussion

538
00:29:19,492 --> 00:29:21,525
is just simply a way
to distract us

539
00:29:21,527 --> 00:29:24,762
from the real problem,
which is customers.

540
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,024
- He's in the backseat.
- Boys will be boys.

541
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:57,795
Unfortunately, boys will be boys
at the expense of girls.

542
00:29:57,797 --> 00:30:00,497
- What I dislike,
what I despise, what I loath

543
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:03,834
are these bastards who are out
there who call themselves men.

544
00:30:03,836 --> 00:30:05,269
They're not men.
What?

545
00:30:05,271 --> 00:30:07,004
'Cause you got a penis
and two balls?

546
00:30:07,006 --> 00:30:08,806
Because you've got money
in your pocket?

547
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:11,975
Because you think that you
can do whatever you want to do

548
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,044
to someone's daughter?

549
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:28,158
- Sheriff's office.

550
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,027
- Pull your pants up, sir,
and step out.

551
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:31,528
- All right.

552
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:33,397
Put that video camera away.

553
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:35,065
- You know what?
Go ahead and put the cigar down.

554
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:36,300
You don't need that right now.
- All right.

555
00:30:36,302 --> 00:30:37,968
- You want to take
the condom off

556
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,336
or you already got it off?
- No, no, no.

557
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:40,437
I ain't got no condom on.
- Okay.

558
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:42,105
- I ain't got no condom on.

559
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:43,106
- All right.

560
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:44,875
- All right, man.

561
00:30:44,877 --> 00:30:46,610
See ya.

562
00:30:46,612 --> 00:30:49,613
[handcuffs snapping]

563
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:53,917
- Come on.

564
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,420
- Who are the Johns?

565
00:30:56,422 --> 00:30:58,422
You think it's some
little lonely creep

566
00:30:58,424 --> 00:31:00,591
sitting in
a basement apartment

567
00:31:00,593 --> 00:31:03,360
watching porn
and getting an erection

568
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:06,563
and going out into the night
looking for a prostitute woman.

569
00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:08,532
Johns are everyday people.

570
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:10,067
I've been to John schools.

571
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:13,337
50% of the guys
have a wedding ring.

572
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:44,635
- "Just lust."

573
00:31:44,637 --> 00:31:47,271
- The majority of these guys
think that,

574
00:31:47,273 --> 00:31:50,340
"hey, it's my right.
I'm a guy.

575
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:53,010
I have money.
And she's a woman."

576
00:31:53,012 --> 00:31:55,012
And they don't want to ask
the woman.

577
00:31:55,014 --> 00:31:57,447
They don't want to know
that that woman

578
00:31:57,449 --> 00:32:01,184
is there by force because
that would ruin their fun.

579
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,535
- Wanna step out
of your underwear?

580
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:20,938
Step out of your underwear.

581
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,241
- From time to time,
I might take a break

582
00:32:24,243 --> 00:32:26,109
from my family,
come out here.

583
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:28,979
Might find a girl I like,
interesting.

584
00:32:28,981 --> 00:32:33,550
Take her to my condo,
influence her with drinks

585
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:37,154
or money or whatever it takes
to try to get laid.

586
00:32:37,156 --> 00:32:38,288
I get laid.

587
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,690
And then I drop them off.

588
00:32:39,692 --> 00:32:41,458
I go back to my normal life.

589
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:51,268
- Do you know what you're doing
is illegal, though, do you?

590
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,136
- Yes, sir.
- You do understand that?

591
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:56,073
- Yes.
- It's not worth it, is it?

592
00:32:56,075 --> 00:32:57,274
- No.
- It's not worth it, is it?

593
00:32:57,276 --> 00:33:01,979
- No, it's not.
- Yeah.

594
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:03,513
- That's what you mean?
- Mm-hmm.

595
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:05,716
- You think these girls
want to be out here?

596
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:13,156
Let me help you
with that one.

597
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:15,559
Okay, I'll help you.
They don't.

598
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:17,327
They don't want to be out here.

599
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:19,663
- Your bad.
Oh, that was, uh...

600
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:20,731
- All right, man.

601
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:25,635
- Like I said, you're
under arrest for purposes...

602
00:33:25,637 --> 00:33:28,772
Loitering for the purposes
of prostitution, okay?

603
00:33:28,774 --> 00:33:30,374
You picked this gal up.

604
00:33:30,376 --> 00:33:31,708
We've been watching you.

605
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,744
You drove all around
all these neighborhoods.

606
00:33:33,746 --> 00:33:36,747
Can you tell me what purpose
you were doing that?

607
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:42,519
We were what?

608
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:45,722
Okay, why do you think
we were following you?

609
00:33:45,724 --> 00:33:49,526
Where were you
giving her a ride to?

610
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:51,161
Why does it take stopping
at an atm machine

611
00:33:51,163 --> 00:33:57,067
to get money just
to give her a ride?

612
00:33:57,069 --> 00:33:58,402
- Don't know.

613
00:33:58,404 --> 00:34:02,072
- Why'd you need money?

614
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:05,742
Oh, that money's for lunch
for tomorrow?

615
00:34:05,744 --> 00:34:08,311
How much you take out?

616
00:34:08,313 --> 00:34:11,748
Yeah. Yeah.

617
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,517
Why you have
to think about it?

618
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:17,087
I went to the atm
earlier today.

619
00:34:17,089 --> 00:34:18,622
I took out 40 bucks.

620
00:34:18,624 --> 00:34:21,625
How much did you just
take out of the atm?

621
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,097
Okay, it's none
of my business.

622
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:28,799
Well, you're gonna
go to jail.

623
00:34:28,801 --> 00:34:31,668
- How many kids you got?

624
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:34,671
Enough?
Sounds kind of negative.

625
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:39,276
No, you're right,
it's your business.

626
00:34:39,278 --> 00:34:41,378
But you'd think you take care
of your business.

627
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:45,382
Doesn't look like you're
taking care of business.

628
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:53,690
Do you know that
she was raped and abused

629
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:55,559
by her dad
when she was little?

630
00:34:55,561 --> 00:34:58,795
And that... I mean, that just
took her to the streets.

631
00:34:58,797 --> 00:35:02,799
You got a family, yeah?
Little kids?

632
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:10,173
Hey, listen, she's not
tearing your family apart.

633
00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:11,675
You're tearing
your family apart.

634
00:35:11,677 --> 00:35:13,143
Why don't you stop
shifting blame

635
00:35:13,145 --> 00:35:15,612
and take a little ownership,
huh?

636
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:18,381
I mean, you smile now,
but just right now

637
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:20,150
in your mind,
picture your wife's face and

638
00:35:20,152 --> 00:35:22,252
what she's gonna think
when she hears this.

639
00:35:22,254 --> 00:35:23,887
I don't think
you'll be laughing as much.

640
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:26,156
And I don't think
you'll be blaming anybody.

641
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,654
- He's been called
one of the most prolific

642
00:37:04,656 --> 00:37:06,923
serial killers
in American history.

643
00:37:06,925 --> 00:37:10,327
Gary RIDGWAY SPENT DECADES,
THE '80s AND THE '90s,

644
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:12,696
preying on prostitutes
in king county.

645
00:37:12,698 --> 00:37:18,268
- The pleasure in killing
is to... it's...

646
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,869
You know, be control...

647
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:23,006
To have sex with them
if I wanted afterwards.

648
00:37:23,008 --> 00:37:26,509
- In 2003, ridgway admitted
killing 48 women,

649
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:28,945
and as part of a plea agreement,
helped investigators

650
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:31,581
recover their bodies
to avoid a death sentence.

651
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:35,352
- He would pick up girls
and young women

652
00:37:35,354 --> 00:37:36,686
along the pacific highway.

653
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:38,855
He was a truck painter
over at kenworth.

654
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:41,725
And he would take them back
either to his house

655
00:37:41,727 --> 00:37:43,460
or kill them in his truck

656
00:37:43,462 --> 00:37:45,729
or take 'em to the woods
and kill them.

657
00:37:45,731 --> 00:37:47,897
- Ridgway choked all of his
victims from behind,

658
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:49,599
saying, "it was more personal

659
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:51,268
and rewarding
than shooting them."

660
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,703
He stole their jewelry,
sometimes leaving it

661
00:37:53,705 --> 00:37:55,505
in the women's restroom
where he worked,

662
00:37:55,507 --> 00:37:58,008
thrilled at the idea
someone would wear it.

663
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:00,510
He often left many bodies
at one place,

664
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:02,412
so he would remember
where they were.

665
00:38:02,414 --> 00:38:05,348
Sometimes he would return
to have intercourse with them,

666
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:09,486
occasionally with
his sleeping son in the car.

667
00:38:09,488 --> 00:38:11,988
Ridgway denies ever being
sexually molested

668
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:14,424
or physically abused,
but he admits

669
00:38:14,426 --> 00:38:16,559
having both sexual and
murderous thoughts

670
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:18,295
about his own mother.

671
00:38:18,297 --> 00:38:20,997
- "I strangled Cynthia hines
to death."

672
00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:22,666
Is that your statement?
- Yes, it is.

673
00:38:22,668 --> 00:38:24,401
- Is it true?
- Yes.

674
00:38:24,403 --> 00:38:26,870
- "I strangled opal mills
to death.

675
00:38:26,872 --> 00:38:29,039
"Delores l. Williams.

676
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:31,941
I strangled Debra estes
to death."

677
00:38:31,943 --> 00:38:33,043
- Yes.

678
00:38:33,045 --> 00:38:34,911
- "I killed so many women,

679
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:38,782
"I have a hard time
keeping them straight.

680
00:38:38,784 --> 00:38:40,850
"I wanted to kill
as many women

681
00:38:40,852 --> 00:38:45,422
I thought were prostitutes
as I possibly could."

682
00:38:45,424 --> 00:38:46,890
Is that true?

683
00:38:46,892 --> 00:38:48,325
- Yes.

684
00:38:48,327 --> 00:38:50,660
- "I picked prostitutes
because

685
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:53,463
"I thought I could kill
as many of them

686
00:38:53,465 --> 00:38:58,401
as I wanted
without getting caught."

687
00:38:58,403 --> 00:39:01,671
- Almost a majority
of his victims

688
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:03,373
were under the age of 18,

689
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:06,509
so as young as 15, 16, 17.

690
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:09,779
He actually said in one of his
lengthy confessions

691
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:13,883
that he preferred killing
the young ones

692
00:39:13,885 --> 00:39:17,887
because they fought more
and had more life in them.

693
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:23,460
- In the fall of 2001, myself,

694
00:39:23,462 --> 00:39:26,129
detective Brian Taylor,
and other members

695
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:28,498
of the precinct four
street crimes unit

696
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,734
conducted a John sting

697
00:39:30,736 --> 00:39:33,002
here at the motel six
in seatac.

698
00:39:33,004 --> 00:39:34,738
As part of that John sting,

699
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:38,508
we were able to catch
Gary ridgway,

700
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:41,611
who later was determined
to be the green river killer.

701
00:39:41,613 --> 00:39:43,747
It was in rooms
like these here

702
00:39:43,749 --> 00:39:47,550
and in hotels like this
along the seatac strip

703
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:50,820
where Gary ridgway
would meet his victims.

704
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:53,790
The reality is,
none of these girls know

705
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:56,426
when they take a John back
to a hotel room like this,

706
00:39:56,428 --> 00:39:58,795
if they're going
to be servicing

707
00:39:58,797 --> 00:40:00,730
the next Gary ridgway.

708
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:21,618
- He was creepy
from the get-go.

709
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,786
He was sadistic.

710
00:40:22,788 --> 00:40:24,988
He cared way more about pain

711
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,723
than he did about sex.

712
00:40:26,725 --> 00:40:31,094
Like, he obviously got aroused
by seeing people suffer.

713
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:34,030
He had a shower curtain
around my neck

714
00:40:34,032 --> 00:40:38,735
at one point and
was just laughing.

715
00:40:38,737 --> 00:40:42,205
Like, he was almost
giggling laughing.

716
00:40:42,207 --> 00:40:44,207
And something in me
just clicked, like,

717
00:40:44,209 --> 00:40:46,609
"I am getting the hell
out of here."

718
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:50,647
And I kicked him,
and I bit him, and I ran.

719
00:40:50,649 --> 00:40:53,750
- Well, Connie told me
to hitchhike to Disneyland,

720
00:40:53,752 --> 00:40:55,218
because I could find tricks

721
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,520
at the bars and stuff there.

722
00:40:57,522 --> 00:40:59,589
Golfers would go there,
you know,

723
00:40:59,591 --> 00:41:02,492
for golfing conventions
and that kind of stuff.

724
00:41:02,494 --> 00:41:05,094
And I would just
sit in a room,

725
00:41:05,096 --> 00:41:06,896
and one golfer after another
would come, you know,

726
00:41:06,898 --> 00:41:08,832
put their money down,
have sex with me.

727
00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:11,634
Oh, my gosh.
There was a Navy base there too.

728
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:13,603
And the Navy base guys

729
00:41:13,605 --> 00:41:15,038
couldn't even do it
one at a time.

730
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,140
It was like four or five
on one, you know?

731
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:19,776
I didn't even know who was where
or what was what.

732
00:41:19,778 --> 00:41:21,211
I just know
that I had something

733
00:41:21,213 --> 00:41:25,748
in every hole I had,
you know?

734
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,250
But Connie was happy
'cause I made

735
00:41:27,252 --> 00:41:28,785
a lot of money, you know?

736
00:41:28,787 --> 00:41:31,187
- A lot of what the men want,

737
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:34,991
it really deals with
degradation, dehumanization.

738
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:37,160
It deals with disrespect.

739
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:39,896
If you really respected
this woman,

740
00:41:39,898 --> 00:41:42,165
if you really felt that

741
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:46,536
she is another human being,
would you do that to her?

742
00:41:46,538 --> 00:41:48,571
Would you do the kinds
of things that you

743
00:41:48,573 --> 00:41:51,641
do to these young women,
to your wife?

744
00:41:51,643 --> 00:41:53,610
Would you want it done
to your sister?

745
00:41:53,612 --> 00:41:55,612
Would you want it done
to your daughter?

746
00:41:55,614 --> 00:41:57,247
If the answers are no,

747
00:41:57,249 --> 00:42:00,250
then why the hell
are you doing it?

748
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:10,994
- Right now a girl or a boy

749
00:42:10,996 --> 00:42:12,629
who's brought in
off the street

750
00:42:12,631 --> 00:42:15,064
originally for suspicion
of prostitution,

751
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:18,568
and then is recognized
of being a trafficking victim,

752
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:19,936
really has nowhere to go.

753
00:42:19,938 --> 00:42:21,037
We're just not
providing services.

754
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,272
So we want to promote
the idea

755
00:42:22,274 --> 00:42:25,942
that shelter
needs to be provided.

756
00:42:25,944 --> 00:42:28,745
- So after contacting
these girls on the streets

757
00:42:28,747 --> 00:42:31,281
over and over and over again

758
00:42:31,283 --> 00:42:34,317
and having no place
to take them, except jail,

759
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,085
hearing some of the really
horrific stories

760
00:42:36,087 --> 00:42:38,621
that they told me, I, you know,

761
00:42:38,623 --> 00:42:40,123
I really wanted
to do something.

762
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:41,257
It affected me quite a bit.

763
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:43,059
So, what I want to do

764
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,894
is put a center together,

765
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:46,796
which will
include safe houses.

766
00:42:46,798 --> 00:42:48,197
And to get these girls
off the street,

767
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:49,933
out of the life.

768
00:42:49,935 --> 00:42:52,302
And then replace
that structure that's

769
00:42:52,304 --> 00:42:54,637
in their life that's
been stripped from them...

770
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:58,074
Their school,
their home life, their job,

771
00:42:58,076 --> 00:42:59,709
any kind of job skill
training,

772
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:01,110
all these structures
that have been...

773
00:43:01,112 --> 00:43:04,047
[police radio chatter]
RIPPED AWAY FROM THEM.

774
00:43:04,049 --> 00:43:05,949
The genesis project
is basically gonna

775
00:43:05,951 --> 00:43:09,252
provide that structure and
replace it back to them.

776
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:11,120
And that's what the idea is.

777
00:43:11,122 --> 00:43:13,289
We're pushing
to get that open.

778
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:16,292
And we're hoping
to get it open 24/7.

779
00:43:16,294 --> 00:43:18,294
And then once
we get that open 24/7,

780
00:43:18,296 --> 00:43:20,229
we want to go
for the safe houses.

781
00:43:20,231 --> 00:43:23,132
We want to provide
a complete a-to-z

782
00:43:23,134 --> 00:43:26,302
comprehensive approach
to completely help

783
00:43:26,304 --> 00:43:29,339
restore these girls and
get them out of the life.

784
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:09,005
- Did you feel like
you had a choice?

785
00:45:09,007 --> 00:45:12,008
- Why?

786
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:16,479
- I don't know, man.

787
00:45:16,481 --> 00:45:19,048
[crying]

788
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,317
Thank you.

789
00:45:21,319 --> 00:45:24,787
- You're crying.

790
00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:26,189
You're worried about them
coming back on you

791
00:45:26,191 --> 00:45:29,058
you or sending somebody
after you, right?

792
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,727
We work with this stuff
all the time,

793
00:45:30,729 --> 00:45:32,862
every single day.

794
00:45:32,864 --> 00:45:34,464
- My sister's with her too.
- Okay.

795
00:45:34,466 --> 00:45:36,032
- Okay...
- And how old is your sister?

796
00:45:36,034 --> 00:45:39,035
- She's 15.

797
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:47,510
- All right.
We're sitting out in front

798
00:45:47,512 --> 00:45:49,112
of the Fairfield here
on the strip in seatac.

799
00:45:49,114 --> 00:45:51,447
We just got a 16-year-old
in custody.

800
00:45:51,449 --> 00:45:53,816
She told us that her sister's
out there too,

801
00:45:53,818 --> 00:45:57,453
but claims she wasn't working,
but we know otherwise.

802
00:45:57,455 --> 00:46:02,091
Brian was able to take
our 16-year-old's phone

803
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:05,128
and pretend to put in
a distress call,

804
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:06,429
and make it look like

805
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:08,831
our 16-year-old
was in some trouble here.

806
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:10,433
So hopefully,
with any luck,

807
00:46:10,435 --> 00:46:13,202
the pimp
is gonna come out and

808
00:46:13,204 --> 00:46:15,204
check on her welfare
and see how she's doing.

809
00:46:15,206 --> 00:46:16,439
'Cause we made it sound like,

810
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:17,840
"you need to get here
right now."

811
00:46:17,842 --> 00:46:20,009
And he responded
that he was coming.

812
00:46:20,011 --> 00:46:23,279
So he should be here
any minute.

813
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:24,514
- Wait till... she's gonna
give us a signal

814
00:46:24,516 --> 00:46:27,517
if that's the right car.

815
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:39,295
- That's it, we got it.

816
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:41,931
- Her sister's
in the passenger seat.

817
00:46:41,933 --> 00:46:43,566
He's coming west
through the back part

818
00:46:43,568 --> 00:46:46,569
of the other parking lot
to the left.

819
00:46:58,015 --> 00:47:00,316
- Put your hands up.
- Hands up.

820
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:03,486
- Get them up!
- Hands up, right now!

821
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:06,355
- Get out of the car.
- Please step out.

822
00:47:06,357 --> 00:47:08,524
- Turn around.
- Away from the car.

823
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:20,203
- Anything you say can be
used as evidence

824
00:47:20,205 --> 00:47:21,470
against you in court.
- What's your name?

825
00:47:21,472 --> 00:47:22,939
- You have the right,
at this time,

826
00:47:22,941 --> 00:47:24,006
to an attorney
of your own choosing.

827
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:25,007
You may have him or her
present

828
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:26,209
before you say or sign anything.

829
00:47:26,211 --> 00:47:28,578
- How old are you.
- 24?

830
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:32,048
- Is that your car?

831
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:34,217
- You need to tell me
what's going on.

832
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:36,552
If you're being forced
into something,

833
00:47:36,554 --> 00:47:38,621
you know what I'm saying,
you need to start talking.

834
00:47:38,623 --> 00:47:40,356
Yes, we can. Okay?

835
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:42,024
And we will do that.

836
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:44,227
Yes. Okay.

837
00:47:44,229 --> 00:47:46,062
Come with me.

838
00:47:46,064 --> 00:47:47,563
- So...
- She has a phone.

839
00:47:47,565 --> 00:47:49,632
And she's been
using my phone.

840
00:47:49,634 --> 00:47:51,601
- She's been using your phone?
- Yes, sir.

841
00:47:51,603 --> 00:47:55,037
- With your permission.

842
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:57,473
So we can look in your phone,
right?

843
00:47:57,475 --> 00:47:59,275
You wouldn't have anything
in your phone that

844
00:47:59,277 --> 00:48:02,278
would be incriminating
if we take a look?

845
00:48:05,415 --> 00:48:09,585
That's quite a hesitation.
Are you sure?

846
00:48:09,587 --> 00:48:11,587
- I mean, it's...

847
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:13,623
- So we're on our way right now
to pick up

848
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:17,560
a 15-year-old juv...
15-year-old juvenile,

849
00:48:17,562 --> 00:48:21,998
the younger sister
of the 16-year-old.

850
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,433
- Wait. They're talking to me
right now.

851
00:48:24,435 --> 00:48:27,603
White coat, blue jeans,
like, a light blue shirt,

852
00:48:27,605 --> 00:48:31,107
a little taller
than the other girl.

853
00:48:31,109 --> 00:48:32,208
Oh, yeah, I got her.

854
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:35,978
- That her?
- Right here.

855
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:38,414
- I got her at the bus stop
at 225 and the highway.

856
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:39,982
Don't get out yet,
till I...

857
00:48:39,984 --> 00:48:42,985
- Till you go first.

858
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:48,557
- I have your sister
under arrest right now

859
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:50,293
for prostitution.

860
00:48:50,295 --> 00:48:51,961
I have the pimp and
the other girl under arrest too.

861
00:48:51,963 --> 00:48:53,396
I'm here to help you,
but I can't

862
00:48:53,398 --> 00:48:55,331
have you lie to me anymore,
all right?

863
00:48:55,333 --> 00:48:56,565
I know why you're here.

864
00:48:56,567 --> 00:48:59,035
I'm trying to help you.

865
00:48:59,037 --> 00:49:02,605
We were a little concerned
about you.

866
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:06,042
Right now I really
just want to help you, okay?

867
00:49:06,044 --> 00:49:07,376
My detectives
that work for me,

868
00:49:07,378 --> 00:49:09,512
all we want to do
is help you,

869
00:49:09,514 --> 00:49:12,214
give you different resources
and get you help, okay?

870
00:49:12,216 --> 00:49:15,618
To get you away
from this situation, all right?

871
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:40,710
- So are you or have you ever
been involved in prostitution?

872
00:49:40,712 --> 00:49:42,411
- Yes.
- Yes.

873
00:49:42,413 --> 00:49:47,350
Uh, when did you first
start prostituting?

874
00:49:47,352 --> 00:49:49,251
- Um...

875
00:49:49,253 --> 00:49:51,420
Well, like,
when I first started

876
00:49:51,422 --> 00:49:52,722
was when I was a teenager.

877
00:49:52,724 --> 00:49:54,156
- How old?

878
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:57,193
- Um, like, 14.

879
00:49:57,195 --> 00:49:59,762
When we were in Las Vegas,

880
00:49:59,764 --> 00:50:02,264
I got my ass whupped, like,
really, really bad.

881
00:50:02,266 --> 00:50:03,766
- By this guy
that you were given to?

882
00:50:03,768 --> 00:50:05,468
- Yeah.
- Okay.

883
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:09,271
- He, you know, just yelled
at me, you know.

884
00:50:09,273 --> 00:50:10,439
And then he went around,
you know,

885
00:50:10,441 --> 00:50:12,174
pulled me out by my hair
and said,

886
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:14,477
"you're gonna do what
the fuck I say," you know?

887
00:50:14,479 --> 00:50:16,178
- Okay.
- "You listen to daddy."

888
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,080
"I'm daddy."
Like, that's his thing.

889
00:50:18,082 --> 00:50:19,582
"I'm daddy."
- Right.

890
00:50:19,584 --> 00:50:23,019
- You know. Ugh. Ugh.

891
00:50:23,021 --> 00:50:26,655
And, uh...
"I'm daddy."

892
00:50:26,657 --> 00:50:31,527
Then he broke down
the daddy rules, you know?

893
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:33,262
"Did you ask your daddy
questions

894
00:50:33,264 --> 00:50:34,630
when you were growing up?"

895
00:50:34,632 --> 00:50:36,766
And, you know,
I had to say, "no."

896
00:50:36,768 --> 00:50:39,235
And, you know, he's, like,
"well, don't ask me questions.

897
00:50:39,237 --> 00:50:41,037
"You know, you ask
your daddy questions,

898
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:42,304
"you're gonna get in trouble.

899
00:50:42,306 --> 00:50:43,339
"You're gonna
get consequences.

900
00:50:43,341 --> 00:50:44,373
You're gonna get slapped."

901
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:45,808
- Mm-hmm.
- You know?

902
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:47,276
And I'm just, like,
"okay, I'm sorry.

903
00:50:47,278 --> 00:50:48,711
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, daddy,"

904
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:50,079
you know, 'cause I kept...
If I don't

905
00:50:50,081 --> 00:50:51,180
call him daddy,
like, he gets mad.

906
00:50:51,182 --> 00:50:52,314
- Okay.

907
00:50:52,316 --> 00:50:53,816
- The only feeling that
we need

908
00:50:53,818 --> 00:50:57,386
to feel is motivated to make,
like, daddy happy.

909
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:59,121
- Okay.
- That's our goal.

910
00:50:59,123 --> 00:51:02,224
That's... that's what
I'm supposed to do.

911
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:03,492
- Okay.

912
00:51:03,494 --> 00:51:07,696
- [stammering]
AND I TRIED. I TRIED.

913
00:51:07,698 --> 00:51:10,199
I did.
- And I just want to be clear.

914
00:51:10,201 --> 00:51:11,400
He doesn't have a job, right?

915
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:12,802
- No.
- Okay.

916
00:51:12,804 --> 00:51:14,670
- His job is bitches.

917
00:51:14,672 --> 00:51:16,472
- Right. Right. Okay.

918
00:51:16,474 --> 00:51:17,640
Where do you work at?

919
00:51:17,642 --> 00:51:19,208
- I don't.

920
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:20,843
- You don't have a job?
- No, sir.

921
00:51:20,845 --> 00:51:22,845
- And how much money
do you have on you tonight?

922
00:51:22,847 --> 00:51:24,780
- A couple hundred.
- Okay, so...

923
00:51:24,782 --> 00:51:26,715
No, no, it was
more like $400, correct?

924
00:51:26,717 --> 00:51:28,284
'Cause my partner counted it
in front of you.

925
00:51:28,286 --> 00:51:29,485
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

926
00:51:29,487 --> 00:51:32,354
So we catch a guy
on pac highway

927
00:51:32,356 --> 00:51:33,556
of high prostitution...

928
00:51:33,558 --> 00:51:35,124
And I want you
to follow me here.

929
00:51:35,126 --> 00:51:36,492
- I know exactly how it looks.
- Follow me.

930
00:51:36,494 --> 00:51:37,860
A high prostitution area.

931
00:51:37,862 --> 00:51:40,796
We catch a guy with $440
in his pocket,

932
00:51:40,798 --> 00:51:43,532
and he's with
three prostitutes,

933
00:51:43,534 --> 00:51:45,668
two juvenile prostitutes,

934
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:48,804
and he's the only one
that has money on him.

935
00:51:48,806 --> 00:51:51,273
If you were me,
what would you be thinking?

936
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:53,242
- It's three white girls,
and I'm a black guy.

937
00:51:53,244 --> 00:51:54,844
So if this white girl
is saying I'm beating her up,

938
00:51:54,846 --> 00:51:57,713
then it's a high chance
I am, right?

939
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,184
No, I'm not saying that
it's a race thing.

940
00:52:02,186 --> 00:52:04,186
I'm saying that I'm aware
of the perception.

941
00:52:04,188 --> 00:52:06,856
I'm aware of the perception
of me being

942
00:52:06,858 --> 00:52:09,458
the only one with money,
and them being who they are.

943
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,460
I'm not saying it's race.
I mean, it's reality.

944
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:12,695
And I'm just telling you,
it's not

945
00:52:12,697 --> 00:52:14,497
that black and white
and simple.

946
00:52:21,571 --> 00:52:23,572
[sighs]

947
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:29,445
- Sir?
- Um...

948
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:33,883
I know answering
some of these questions

949
00:52:33,885 --> 00:52:35,584
is not gonna help me at all.

950
00:52:35,586 --> 00:52:37,653
- You want to... you refuse
to answer that question,

951
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:39,722
'cause you know this
is the strip, the track,

952
00:52:39,724 --> 00:52:41,924
the blade,
whatever you call it.

953
00:52:41,926 --> 00:52:43,893
You refuse to answer
that question.

954
00:52:43,895 --> 00:52:46,595
You can't come up
with the most basic,

955
00:52:46,597 --> 00:52:50,499
simple answer to the most basic
simple question.

956
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:52,401
Anywhere I've ever been,
I could always

957
00:52:52,403 --> 00:52:54,537
tell you why I'm there.
- Sir, so...

958
00:52:54,539 --> 00:52:57,606
- And you refuse
to answer the question.

959
00:52:57,608 --> 00:53:00,276
You absolutely refuse
to answer that question

960
00:53:00,278 --> 00:53:03,746
'cause you don't have a good
answer for why you're up here,

961
00:53:03,748 --> 00:53:06,649
an hour and a half
from oak harbor.

962
00:53:06,651 --> 00:53:09,652
You can't tell me
why you came up to seatac.

963
00:53:11,888 --> 00:53:13,756
But you want to try
to explain it to me,

964
00:53:13,758 --> 00:53:15,291
to reason it with me.

965
00:53:15,293 --> 00:53:17,193
- Sir, you told me
I had a right to...

966
00:53:17,195 --> 00:53:18,861
- Simple question, dude.
- You told me I had a right

967
00:53:18,863 --> 00:53:20,462
to not answer some questions,
right?

968
00:53:20,464 --> 00:53:21,730
- Well, you know what?
If it's all right

969
00:53:21,732 --> 00:53:24,233
with you, partner,
I think we done.

970
00:53:24,235 --> 00:53:25,868
- Yeah.
- Okay.

971
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:31,974
- What kind of situation
you come from at home?

972
00:53:34,678 --> 00:53:36,812
What I mean, is what kind
of parents do you have?

973
00:53:36,814 --> 00:53:39,815
Treat you bad?
What's going on?

974
00:53:47,657 --> 00:53:49,858
- So there's nothing
to stay at home for?

975
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:52,394
- Mm-mm.

976
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:54,630
- If you could get out of it
and your sister

977
00:53:54,632 --> 00:53:57,633
could get out of it tonight,
would you want to?

978
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:09,311
- I don't know if you've
been told this before,

979
00:54:09,313 --> 00:54:11,981
but you don't deserve
that type of treatment.

980
00:54:11,983 --> 00:54:13,249
You know that.

981
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,256
- No, you're right,
but it can change.

982
00:54:20,258 --> 00:54:22,758
And I think...
I know you've lived

983
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,460
15 years on this earth,
and it doesn't

984
00:54:24,462 --> 00:54:26,829
seem like
anything's gonna change.

985
00:54:26,831 --> 00:54:28,430
But if you want it to change,
there are people

986
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:30,466
here in this building tonight
with you

987
00:54:30,468 --> 00:54:34,036
that want to help you.

988
00:54:34,038 --> 00:54:37,039
I mean, you're precious.

989
00:54:42,846 --> 00:54:45,848
My heart hurts because
you didn't grow up hearing that.

990
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:51,520
You didn't grow up being told
that you're a princess

991
00:54:51,522 --> 00:54:54,523
and that you've got value
and worth.

992
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:06,435
- I HAD...
[sighs]

993
00:55:06,437 --> 00:55:12,041
Three children
in my stomach.

994
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:18,747
I was told it was just
a mass of tissue.

995
00:55:18,749 --> 00:55:22,785
Connie told me the only good
pregnant hooker

996
00:55:22,787 --> 00:55:24,687
is a dead pregnant hooker,

997
00:55:24,689 --> 00:55:27,556
and that I was no good
to her pregnant.

998
00:55:27,558 --> 00:55:31,026
No one would buy me
if I was pregnant.

999
00:55:31,028 --> 00:55:34,830
So she took me
to the abortion clinic,

1000
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:38,033
not too far
from my 20th birthday.

1001
00:55:38,035 --> 00:55:39,435
[clears throat]

1002
00:55:39,437 --> 00:55:42,604
That was my first abortion.

1003
00:55:42,606 --> 00:55:47,409
I had been singing
to that baby.

1004
00:55:47,411 --> 00:55:49,945
I was full of wonder.

1005
00:55:49,947 --> 00:55:55,751
I thought I wasn't alone.

1006
00:55:55,753 --> 00:55:59,555
It was a human being
growing inside of me.

1007
00:55:59,557 --> 00:56:03,425
[crying]

1008
00:56:03,427 --> 00:56:09,064
And they took that...
Took me in that room,

1009
00:56:09,066 --> 00:56:12,601
and just vacuumed it out.

1010
00:56:12,603 --> 00:56:17,005
And I almost bled to death
a couple of times.

1011
00:56:17,007 --> 00:56:18,474
I'd be out on the street,

1012
00:56:18,476 --> 00:56:20,142
and I'd just
start gushing blood.

1013
00:56:20,144 --> 00:56:22,411
They finally took me
to the hospital.

1014
00:56:22,413 --> 00:56:23,812
And they did a d&c.

1015
00:56:23,814 --> 00:56:26,482
And they wanted me
to stay overnight.

1016
00:56:26,484 --> 00:56:30,652
Connie wouldn't
let me stay overnight

1017
00:56:30,654 --> 00:56:31,954
'cause she said
they didn't have

1018
00:56:31,956 --> 00:56:33,689
any food at home,
and I had to go to work.

1019
00:56:33,691 --> 00:56:37,059
And I said,
"I can't work, you know?

1020
00:56:37,061 --> 00:56:39,661
The doctor doesn't even
want me out of the hospital."

1021
00:56:39,663 --> 00:56:41,730
And there was
so much pain down here.

1022
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:45,134
And there was so much pain
in my heart.

1023
00:56:45,136 --> 00:56:48,437
And I wished that I had died
with that baby.

1024
00:56:48,439 --> 00:56:51,440
[crying]

1025
00:56:54,444 --> 00:56:56,979
But I had to leave the hospital
that night

1026
00:56:56,981 --> 00:56:59,915
and make enough money
for them to have dinner.

1027
00:57:02,552 --> 00:57:04,052
[electronic beep]

1028
00:57:04,054 --> 00:57:08,724
- West on 95th.
How far did you guys go down?

1029
00:57:08,726 --> 00:57:10,859
- About a half mile.

1030
00:57:10,861 --> 00:57:13,862
[door opens]

1031
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:29,478
[engine starts]

1032
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:38,587
- Police.

1033
00:57:38,589 --> 00:57:41,590
- Step out
and talk to me, sir.

1034
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,734
There's not very many
of these girls out here

1035
00:57:52,736 --> 00:57:54,803
'cause they
want to be out here.

1036
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:56,071
And the ones that
tell you that

1037
00:57:56,073 --> 00:57:59,508
has had horrific home lives...

1038
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:03,579
Molested, abused,
and bad situations.

1039
00:58:03,581 --> 00:58:06,615
And you're
taking advantage of that

1040
00:58:06,617 --> 00:58:09,985
by engaging
in this activity.

1041
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:11,887
- I'm very sorry, sir.

1042
00:58:11,889 --> 00:58:13,155
- You don't apologize to me.
- Yeah, I know.

1043
00:58:13,157 --> 00:58:17,259
- You need to apologize to her,
okay?

1044
00:58:17,261 --> 00:58:19,194
You need to apologize to her
'cause at what point

1045
00:58:19,196 --> 00:58:20,762
in her life did she say,

1046
00:58:20,764 --> 00:58:23,232
"I want to grow up and
be a prostitute and

1047
00:58:23,234 --> 00:58:25,968
suck dick in an alley
in his truck?"

1048
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:27,269
- No. Never...

1049
00:58:27,271 --> 00:58:28,737
- You think she ever
had those dreams,

1050
00:58:28,739 --> 00:58:30,138
that ever been a part
of her dream?

1051
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:32,608
- No, sir.

1052
00:58:37,213 --> 00:58:39,214
- You got an I.D.?

1053
00:58:41,084 --> 00:58:43,952
- It's not enough with porn.

1054
00:58:43,954 --> 00:58:45,287
But obviously, it's just

1055
00:58:45,289 --> 00:58:47,956
feeling the touch
of someone else.

1056
00:58:47,958 --> 00:58:50,058
- When you look
at this whole thing,

1057
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:53,128
prostitution is the main act.

1058
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:56,064
And porn, for these men,
is the dress rehearsal.

1059
00:58:56,066 --> 00:58:58,300
They see it,
and then they go,

1060
00:58:58,302 --> 00:59:01,870
and they act it out.

1061
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:03,839
- AND MY MOM ALWAYS SAID,
"NEVER LOOK AT <i>PLAYBOY.</i>"

1062
00:59:03,841 --> 00:59:06,608
SO I WAS LIKE, "OKAY,"
SO I TYPED IN <i>"PLAYBOY".</i>

1063
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:11,246
And after that,
I got into a lot of...

1064
00:59:11,248 --> 00:59:13,682
Just so self-indulgent
that you just

1065
00:59:13,684 --> 00:59:15,250
go from one thing
to another

1066
00:59:15,252 --> 00:59:17,719
and just go all the way,
you know.

1067
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:18,954
Like when it's Thanksgiving,
you just

1068
00:59:18,956 --> 00:59:21,757
eat as much as you can
until it hurts.

1069
00:59:21,759 --> 00:59:23,258
- At first,
maybe they get turned on,

1070
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:25,260
or maybe even
they get disgusted first.

1071
00:59:25,262 --> 00:59:27,696
But then they look again,
and then they look again,

1072
00:59:27,698 --> 00:59:30,866
and they go, "hmm.
I'd like to maybe try that."

1073
00:59:30,868 --> 00:59:33,268
And that's what
sets them into

1074
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:35,203
going down the path
of a John.

1075
00:59:35,205 --> 00:59:38,273
- You can only look at porn
for so long, you know.

1076
00:59:38,275 --> 00:59:39,908
It gets boring.

1077
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:41,643
And you need to have
something else.

1078
00:59:41,645 --> 00:59:43,879
You need to experience
what they're experiencing.

1079
00:59:43,881 --> 00:59:45,847
- Porn drives demand
for trafficking.

1080
00:59:45,849 --> 00:59:48,250
It's a form of advertising
for prostitution.

1081
00:59:48,252 --> 00:59:49,918
And we have more porn,
you got more people

1082
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,320
who are consuming it,
you're gonna

1083
00:59:51,322 --> 00:59:53,956
be demanding more women
being trafficked and

1084
00:59:53,958 --> 00:59:55,357
prostituted in a society.

1085
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:57,092
- Well, my name
is Donny pauling.

1086
00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:59,027
And I went by the name
Donovan Phillips

1087
00:59:59,029 --> 01:00:00,862
when I was in the porn world.

1088
01:00:00,864 --> 01:00:03,265
And I was in that world
as a producer for nine years.

1089
01:00:03,267 --> 01:00:06,101
And in that amount of time,
I went from

1090
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:08,770
being a producer
for one amateur site

1091
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:11,807
to the place where
I owned my network of sites

1092
01:00:11,809 --> 01:00:14,810
that had 12,000,000 visitors
a month coming to it.

1093
01:00:20,183 --> 01:00:22,317
And there was more
than 500 first-timers

1094
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,186
that I recruited
in my career.

1095
01:00:24,188 --> 01:00:26,154
- These guys
are pretty slick now.

1096
01:00:26,156 --> 01:00:27,889
They actually
go to the malls,

1097
01:00:27,891 --> 01:00:30,359
they actually
go to the movie theaters,

1098
01:00:30,361 --> 01:00:32,194
underage dance clubs,
and they hand out

1099
01:00:32,196 --> 01:00:35,931
business cards, saying
they're a modeling agency.

1100
01:00:35,933 --> 01:00:37,099
- You know, what do you do?
You walk up and say,

1101
01:00:37,101 --> 01:00:38,634
"you want
to model for porn?"

1102
01:00:38,636 --> 01:00:40,002
No, I was...
I came up with a story

1103
01:00:40,004 --> 01:00:41,403
almost instantly in my head.

1104
01:00:41,405 --> 01:00:43,038
I was really good
at manipulating people

1105
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,974
and deceiving them,
including my wife

1106
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:48,043
who didn't know what
I was doing for three years.

1107
01:00:48,045 --> 01:00:51,279
But for this girl,
I walked up to her and...

1108
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:53,915
"Is your name..."
You know, I'll say Carrie.

1109
01:00:53,917 --> 01:00:56,084
"Is your name Carrie?"
"No, I'm not Carrie."

1110
01:00:56,086 --> 01:00:58,387
"All right. I'm looking
for a girl named Carrie."

1111
01:00:58,389 --> 01:00:59,988
And then I walked away,
and I'm, like,

1112
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:01,857
looking around like
I'm looking for someone.

1113
01:01:01,859 --> 01:01:03,692
And, you know,
let a few minutes pass.

1114
01:01:03,694 --> 01:01:06,094
And then go back and sit down
by her and say,

1115
01:01:06,096 --> 01:01:09,097
"man, that sucks.
I was gonna pay her $500 today."

1116
01:01:09,099 --> 01:01:10,832
"Really?"

1117
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:12,267
"Yeah, yeah. I was gonna
do this photo..."

1118
01:01:12,269 --> 01:01:14,002
You know, I acted
all nonchalant.

1119
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:15,370
And, you know,
30 minutes later,

1120
01:01:15,372 --> 01:01:18,440
she was in front
of my cameras.

1121
01:01:18,442 --> 01:01:21,043
- It's akin
to the grooming process

1122
01:01:21,045 --> 01:01:23,412
that you see
in prostitution.

1123
01:01:23,414 --> 01:01:25,714
To lure in, to groom,
and then there's

1124
01:01:25,716 --> 01:01:27,082
a breaking process
that occurs

1125
01:01:27,084 --> 01:01:28,950
where their will
is just broken.

1126
01:01:28,952 --> 01:01:30,452
And, you know, the same thing
happens in the porn industry.

1127
01:01:30,454 --> 01:01:32,187
- The pornography worked

1128
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:34,389
in a couple different ways.

1129
01:01:34,391 --> 01:01:37,926
Part of it was
they were filming me alone,

1130
01:01:37,928 --> 01:01:39,695
or they would film me

1131
01:01:39,697 --> 01:01:43,865
with guys or groups
or whoever,

1132
01:01:43,867 --> 01:01:45,434
and just hold that
as one of the reasons

1133
01:01:45,436 --> 01:01:47,102
why I couldn't run,
or one of the reasons

1134
01:01:47,104 --> 01:01:48,937
why nobody would believe me.

1135
01:01:48,939 --> 01:01:51,073
'Cause they were saying,
"you know, you can't leave.

1136
01:01:51,075 --> 01:01:53,975
"You're a whore
who has herself on film.

1137
01:01:53,977 --> 01:01:58,947
You know, no one's gonna believe
that you're a victim here."

1138
01:01:58,949 --> 01:02:01,416
So that was a piece
that I've been scared of,

1139
01:02:01,418 --> 01:02:03,418
and I know will follow
me the rest of my life.

1140
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:06,288
You know, I've had people
walk up to me

1141
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:09,057
in public places and say,
"hey, I saw your film."

1142
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:10,358
- Trafficking victims

1143
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:12,494
are used in the production
of porn.

1144
01:02:12,496 --> 01:02:16,264
Across the globe,
women who are being forced

1145
01:02:16,266 --> 01:02:18,934
into the sex industry,
they're being filmed.

1146
01:02:18,936 --> 01:02:20,168
I mean, it's just natural.

1147
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:21,837
Porn and prostitution
go together.

1148
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:23,338
You go to any
red light district,

1149
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:25,741
you go to Vegas, you got porn
all over the place,

1150
01:02:25,743 --> 01:02:28,744
you get prostitution
all over the place.

1151
01:02:31,881 --> 01:02:35,250
- When did you buy
the first girl, first woman?

1152
01:02:35,252 --> 01:02:37,953
- I probably was 18, 19

1153
01:02:37,955 --> 01:02:39,988
when I went down
to the bunny ranch.

1154
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:41,857
- Oh, you went down
to the Vegas... in Vegas?

1155
01:02:41,859 --> 01:02:44,960
- Yeah. So it was legal. So...

1156
01:02:44,962 --> 01:02:47,996
But yeah, obviously,
it's illegal here.

1157
01:02:47,998 --> 01:02:50,866
So I wish I was there now
'cause obviously,

1158
01:02:50,868 --> 01:02:52,300
I wouldn't
be in trouble now,

1159
01:02:52,302 --> 01:02:55,036
and I wouldn't be talking
with you guys.

1160
01:02:55,038 --> 01:02:56,471
- Yeah, but if you hear
what you just said,

1161
01:02:56,473 --> 01:02:57,506
you wished you'd be there.

1162
01:02:57,508 --> 01:02:59,274
The girls there abused,

1163
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:01,009
exploited
from a young age too.

1164
01:03:01,011 --> 01:03:02,778
I don't care
if it's legal or not.

1165
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:05,814
It doesn't make it right
'cause it's legal.

1166
01:03:05,816 --> 01:03:07,249
- I understand that,
but I wouldn't be

1167
01:03:07,251 --> 01:03:09,818
in this predicament
right now if I was there.

1168
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:11,453
- No, but listen,
you are in this predicament now

1169
01:03:11,455 --> 01:03:15,090
because you were there.

1170
01:03:15,092 --> 01:03:16,191
You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

1171
01:03:16,193 --> 01:03:17,492
- Get your fix
at 18 years old

1172
01:03:17,494 --> 01:03:19,227
and think,
"okay, I'm a young guy.

1173
01:03:19,229 --> 01:03:20,428
"I put enough money down,

1174
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:22,063
I can do whatever I want
to a woman."

1175
01:03:22,065 --> 01:03:23,198
You see how that's
a little bit twisted?

1176
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,966
- This isn't even about sex.

1177
01:03:24,968 --> 01:03:26,501
I mean, porn is not about sex.

1178
01:03:26,503 --> 01:03:30,405
It's about a very specific type
of sex, commercial sex,

1179
01:03:30,407 --> 01:03:33,008
which is inherently
exploitative.

1180
01:03:33,010 --> 01:03:34,476
Porn production itself

1181
01:03:34,478 --> 01:03:36,178
is a form
of sex trafficking.

1182
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:37,512
Under U.S. federal law,

1183
01:03:37,514 --> 01:03:39,381
the trafficking
victims protection act,

1184
01:03:39,383 --> 01:03:41,449
sex trafficking
is defined

1185
01:03:41,451 --> 01:03:43,985
as the recruitment,
the provision,

1186
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:46,588
the solicitation,
the transportation of a person

1187
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:48,523
for a commercial sex act.

1188
01:03:48,525 --> 01:03:51,293
That's a day-in and day-out life
of a porn producer.

1189
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:53,428
- We don't think about that
when we're looking at porn.

1190
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:55,163
We just see this fantasy.

1191
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:59,835
Those faces and those
expressions and those noises

1192
01:03:59,837 --> 01:04:04,206
that the girls are making
are 100% fake.

1193
01:04:04,208 --> 01:04:07,142
- It's an act.
It's totally an act.

1194
01:04:07,144 --> 01:04:11,346
Like, you learn when
to moan

1195
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:13,181
and when to sigh

1196
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:17,219
and 'cause if I could make
a guy's experience

1197
01:04:17,221 --> 01:04:18,987
almost more pleasurable,

1198
01:04:18,989 --> 01:04:21,356
I'd be out of there faster,

1199
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:23,391
and it probably wouldn't be
as violent.

1200
01:04:23,393 --> 01:04:27,596
- When a society demands
more porn,

1201
01:04:27,598 --> 01:04:30,298
it's demanding
more prostituted women.

1202
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:32,234
It's demanding
more exploited women.

1203
01:04:32,236 --> 01:04:34,169
It's demanding more women

1204
01:04:34,171 --> 01:04:36,972
being turned into objects
and commodities.

1205
01:04:36,974 --> 01:04:42,310
- I would not want to live
frickin' 50 years in this,

1206
01:04:42,312 --> 01:04:46,414
you know,
wasteland of used people

1207
01:04:46,416 --> 01:04:49,384
and degrading yourself
and degrading others.

1208
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:54,656
And the only point being...
And the only high point

1209
01:04:54,658 --> 01:04:57,959
is finding
a really good blowjob.

1210
01:04:57,961 --> 01:04:59,361
Like that's your life?

1211
01:04:59,363 --> 01:05:02,063
That's like...
It's so meaningless.

1212
01:05:02,065 --> 01:05:06,067
- I sold my family out
for $1/2 million a year.

1213
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:09,037
How cheap
are you selling yours out?

1214
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:13,441
A couple images,
some video clips?

1215
01:05:13,443 --> 01:05:16,211
It's not worth it.

1216
01:05:22,351 --> 01:05:24,052
- You're under arrest
for commercial sex abuse

1217
01:05:24,054 --> 01:05:25,220
of a minor.

1218
01:05:25,222 --> 01:05:27,222
[handcuffs click]

1219
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:33,662
Let's go back here.

1220
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:03,491
- If a daughter isn't feeling
loved by her father,

1221
01:06:03,493 --> 01:06:07,162
she's very vulnerable to find
that love in other places,

1222
01:06:07,164 --> 01:06:10,632
either through a boyfriend,
a pimp, older men.

1223
01:06:10,634 --> 01:06:13,168
And that may not be the love
that she wants or needs,

1224
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:16,504
but it is attention,
and it is validation of sorts.

1225
01:06:16,506 --> 01:06:19,107
It's the kind of attention
and validation and love

1226
01:06:19,109 --> 01:06:20,742
that she's not getting
at home.

1227
01:06:20,744 --> 01:06:24,346
And it leaves her vulnerable
to the prey of a pimp.

1228
01:06:24,348 --> 01:06:26,648
- Most teenage girls
are asking two questions...

1229
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:29,117
"Do I matter?"
And "do I have value?"

1230
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:30,652
And they're getting answers
to those questions

1231
01:06:30,654 --> 01:06:32,320
from a lot of places.

1232
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:35,190
From their friends,
from school, from the media.

1233
01:06:35,192 --> 01:06:36,992
And most of the time,
those answers

1234
01:06:36,994 --> 01:06:39,260
that they're getting
are not true.

1235
01:06:39,262 --> 01:06:42,564
They don't speak of the value
of a person

1236
01:06:42,566 --> 01:06:45,100
and of the purpose
of a person.

1237
01:06:45,102 --> 01:06:47,369
And so these girls need
to hear

1238
01:06:47,371 --> 01:06:49,504
from their parents
that they do matter,

1239
01:06:49,506 --> 01:06:53,675
that they do have value,
that their life is significant.

1240
01:06:53,677 --> 01:06:56,478
- Unfortunately, there is still
a tremendously strong link

1241
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:59,214
between a woman's value
in our society

1242
01:06:59,216 --> 01:07:01,216
and her sense of sexuality.

1243
01:07:01,218 --> 01:07:03,518
Young girls are seeing thousands
of messages every day

1244
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:06,388
from a variety of sources
that directly tell her

1245
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:08,289
her value and worth
in the world

1246
01:07:08,291 --> 01:07:12,660
is connected to her body.

1247
01:07:12,662 --> 01:07:14,529
- When we focus too much
on the outside,

1248
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:16,197
on the physical appearance,

1249
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:18,533
"are you pretty?
Are you beautiful?"

1250
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:20,101
Then they miss out
on hearing

1251
01:07:20,103 --> 01:07:23,171
about their significance,
on their value.

1252
01:07:23,173 --> 01:07:25,340
They miss out on
the message that says,

1253
01:07:25,342 --> 01:07:28,076
"you can be part of
something bigger than yourself."

1254
01:07:28,078 --> 01:07:30,612
- Should a father,
should a mother delight

1255
01:07:30,614 --> 01:07:33,448
in a child's precocious beauty

1256
01:07:33,450 --> 01:07:35,750
and her playfulness
and innocence?

1257
01:07:35,752 --> 01:07:37,318
Absolutely yes.

1258
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,054
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1259
01:07:39,056 --> 01:07:40,588
But if beauty
is the only thing

1260
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:42,323
you're drawing attention to,

1261
01:07:42,325 --> 01:07:45,060
you're really doing
gender violence.

1262
01:07:45,062 --> 01:07:49,230
Do you tell your beautiful
two-year-old son

1263
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:50,732
that he's beautiful?

1264
01:07:50,734 --> 01:07:52,300
I hope so.

1265
01:07:52,302 --> 01:07:54,769
I hope, in many ways,
as often.

1266
01:07:54,771 --> 01:07:56,471
But why do you
then talk about,

1267
01:07:56,473 --> 01:07:59,340
"oh, you are so strong."

1268
01:07:59,342 --> 01:08:01,409
Say that to your daughter?

1269
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:02,811
"You are so bright.

1270
01:08:02,813 --> 01:08:05,547
You know, you are so funny."

1271
01:08:05,549 --> 01:08:08,550
In other words, our task
is not to create,

1272
01:08:08,552 --> 01:08:14,289
but one window of honoring
the glory

1273
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:16,291
of being made
in the image of God.

1274
01:08:16,293 --> 01:08:19,861
The facets of
a child's ongoing growth

1275
01:08:19,863 --> 01:08:22,797
of goodness and beauty

1276
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:27,435
now needs to be heard
as not merely physical,

1277
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:29,471
but a kind of beauty
that has to do with,

1278
01:08:29,473 --> 01:08:31,706
"I love the way
you fight with me.

1279
01:08:31,708 --> 01:08:34,609
"You are really articulate
seven-year-old.

1280
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:37,278
"In fact, I got a point
a moment or two ago

1281
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:41,216
"when I wasn't quite sure
what to do with you.

1282
01:08:41,218 --> 01:08:42,851
"You are really bright.

1283
01:08:42,853 --> 01:08:45,753
"Now, you're also gonna
go to your room.

1284
01:08:45,755 --> 01:08:48,189
"So you're not gonna get
more ice cream.

1285
01:08:48,191 --> 01:08:50,625
But I love the way
you argued for that."

1286
01:08:50,627 --> 01:08:52,527
- A girl who was raised
by a loving father

1287
01:08:52,529 --> 01:08:54,195
and an attentive mother

1288
01:08:54,197 --> 01:08:56,331
who are modeling
a healthy relationship

1289
01:08:56,333 --> 01:08:57,765
is much less likely
to be at risk

1290
01:08:57,767 --> 01:08:59,400
for a pimp's manipulations

1291
01:08:59,402 --> 01:09:02,504
and caught in
the trap of prostitution.

1292
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:07,575
- You can't help but look
at a girl that's that age

1293
01:09:07,577 --> 01:09:08,877
when you have a girl
that age

1294
01:09:08,879 --> 01:09:10,879
and think
of a stark difference.

1295
01:09:10,881 --> 01:09:12,413
It's like, "oh, let's see.

1296
01:09:12,415 --> 01:09:14,749
I know where my daughter
is right now," you know.

1297
01:09:14,751 --> 01:09:16,584
And you think about the things
your daughter does,

1298
01:09:16,586 --> 01:09:17,852
a typical 15-year-old.

1299
01:09:17,854 --> 01:09:20,288
Oh, she's involved
in softball

1300
01:09:20,290 --> 01:09:23,858
and glee club and whatever,
drama after school.

1301
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:25,827
And then you come out here
and go to work

1302
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:28,663
and see a girl whose life
is the street, and that's it.

1303
01:09:28,665 --> 01:09:30,899
- I think it was just
like last year or something

1304
01:09:30,901 --> 01:09:33,434
I saw "sleeping beauty"
for the first time.

1305
01:09:33,436 --> 01:09:34,769
It was like I don't...
You know,

1306
01:09:34,771 --> 01:09:36,271
I felt like I lived
under a rock.

1307
01:09:36,273 --> 01:09:37,639
But at the same time,
I had to be

1308
01:09:37,641 --> 01:09:40,542
so much more mature than
the age I really was.

1309
01:09:40,544 --> 01:09:42,510
And so it was almost as if
I went from

1310
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:46,748
8 years old
and I skipped all the way to 25.

1311
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:51,719
And I missed my childhood.

1312
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:55,957
Yeah, I feel robbed.

1313
01:09:55,959 --> 01:09:57,592
- Do you think
she wants some dude,

1314
01:09:57,594 --> 01:09:59,494
some gross dude
slobbering on her,

1315
01:09:59,496 --> 01:10:00,895
shoving his little thing
in her mouth?

1316
01:10:00,897 --> 01:10:03,298
You think she enjoys that?

1317
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:08,836
- That's pretty much...
You know what?

1318
01:10:08,838 --> 01:10:10,572
- Let me answer
the question for you.

1319
01:10:10,574 --> 01:10:11,906
Okay?

1320
01:10:11,908 --> 01:10:13,675
Girls like this that are
on the streets

1321
01:10:13,677 --> 01:10:16,544
have been raped at the age
of 9, 10, 11, 12 years old,

1322
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:17,712
put on the streets.

1323
01:10:17,714 --> 01:10:19,214
No girl grows up saying,

1324
01:10:19,216 --> 01:10:21,916
"hey, I want some guy
to slobber on me

1325
01:10:21,918 --> 01:10:24,319
and shove his crap
into my mouth."

1326
01:10:24,321 --> 01:10:26,921
No little girl grows up
wanting to do that.

1327
01:10:26,923 --> 01:10:28,790
I don't know if you have
a sister, a mom...

1328
01:10:28,792 --> 01:10:30,391
A daughter, whatever.

1329
01:10:30,393 --> 01:10:31,693
You imagine if that...
No, no, no.

1330
01:10:31,695 --> 01:10:32,927
Look at me
when I'm talking to you.

1331
01:10:32,929 --> 01:10:34,629
You imagine your mom
or your sister

1332
01:10:34,631 --> 01:10:36,531
going on the streets,

1333
01:10:36,533 --> 01:10:38,366
having a bunch
of slobbering dudes like you

1334
01:10:38,368 --> 01:10:40,335
shoving stuff in their mouth,

1335
01:10:40,337 --> 01:10:42,503
you'd be cool with that?

1336
01:10:42,505 --> 01:10:43,972
I'll be straight up with you,
man to man, okay?

1337
01:10:43,974 --> 01:10:46,474
If that was my sister
and my mom, my wife,

1338
01:10:46,476 --> 01:10:50,345
I'd kill you.

1339
01:10:50,347 --> 01:10:52,013
- That ain't just
some piece of meat.

1340
01:10:52,015 --> 01:10:53,982
It's a human being.

1341
01:10:55,718 --> 01:11:00,755
- I get angry sometimes
'cause I feel so robbed.

1342
01:11:00,757 --> 01:11:05,660
I can see inside my heart.

1343
01:11:05,662 --> 01:11:11,666
There's a good person
in there.

1344
01:11:11,668 --> 01:11:15,303
I have so much
I want to give.

1345
01:11:15,305 --> 01:11:17,872
- Like, no girl wants
to have sex with some guy

1346
01:11:17,874 --> 01:11:20,041
that they hate or can't stand
or is grossed out by

1347
01:11:20,043 --> 01:11:22,910
or has to vomit later
because it's so disgusting.

1348
01:11:22,912 --> 01:11:25,280
Or has the stench of a man

1349
01:11:25,282 --> 01:11:29,517
stuck on her fingers and
her body for hours afterwards

1350
01:11:29,519 --> 01:11:31,319
to where you can check out
mentally,

1351
01:11:31,321 --> 01:11:32,720
but you have to continue
to smell it,

1352
01:11:32,722 --> 01:11:34,322
and so you're stuck.

1353
01:11:34,324 --> 01:11:38,326
There's nothing about that
that I enjoyed.

1354
01:11:38,328 --> 01:11:41,863
- I'll lose, like,
20, 30 pounds,

1355
01:11:41,865 --> 01:11:45,967
and I'm literally terrified
something will happen.

1356
01:11:45,969 --> 01:11:49,604
Like, a guy will smile at me,
just probably being nice.

1357
01:11:49,606 --> 01:11:52,373
But to me,
it's like a trigger,

1358
01:11:52,375 --> 01:11:55,043
going back to, um...

1359
01:11:55,045 --> 01:11:56,911
"Oh, my God,
he finds me attractive."

1360
01:11:56,913 --> 01:11:58,579
You know.

1361
01:11:58,581 --> 01:12:00,615
And then I find myself
just eating chocolate

1362
01:12:00,617 --> 01:12:01,816
and all that kind of stuff,

1363
01:12:01,818 --> 01:12:04,352
so I can get
that weight back.

1364
01:12:04,354 --> 01:12:09,557
And I don't want
to be unhealthy.

1365
01:12:09,559 --> 01:12:12,927
And I don't want to be ugly.

1366
01:12:12,929 --> 01:12:15,730
But ugly is safe.

1367
01:12:15,732 --> 01:12:18,466
Ugly is so safe.

1368
01:12:18,468 --> 01:12:22,537
I'm not afraid
of being raped anymore

1369
01:12:22,539 --> 01:12:25,440
because I'm ugly.

1370
01:12:25,442 --> 01:12:29,510
I'm just safe.
I am so safe.

1371
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:31,479
I guess I have to say it
over and over again

1372
01:12:31,481 --> 01:12:36,084
because deep down inside
I don't even believe that.

1373
01:12:40,723 --> 01:12:42,890
They're talking about
their kids in school,

1374
01:12:42,892 --> 01:12:45,426
they're talking
about their fun college years.

1375
01:12:45,428 --> 01:12:48,062
They're talking about
dates they had.

1376
01:12:48,064 --> 01:12:50,631
What am I gonna talk about?

1377
01:12:50,633 --> 01:12:52,500
My children are dead.

1378
01:12:52,502 --> 01:12:56,804
I never went on a date.

1379
01:12:56,806 --> 01:13:00,675
Never got married.

1380
01:13:00,677 --> 01:13:04,379
I'm so strange.

1381
01:13:04,381 --> 01:13:09,517
I'm so strange to everybody.

1382
01:13:17,993 --> 01:13:19,961
- This is kind of
a historic...

1383
01:13:19,963 --> 01:13:22,730
I think it's a historic night.

1384
01:13:22,732 --> 01:13:24,732
IT'S THE OPENING.
[cheers and applause]

1385
01:13:24,734 --> 01:13:28,569
Awesome.

1386
01:13:28,571 --> 01:13:30,571
We have our staff,
and our volunteer staff

1387
01:13:30,573 --> 01:13:32,006
is gonna be here tonight.

1388
01:13:32,008 --> 01:13:36,444
And what we're hoping to do
is find a girl

1389
01:13:36,446 --> 01:13:38,179
that is a good candidate.

1390
01:13:38,181 --> 01:13:39,881
A good candidate meaning
they're ready

1391
01:13:39,883 --> 01:13:41,516
to get out of the life,

1392
01:13:41,518 --> 01:13:44,552
they're willing to take
that first step.

1393
01:13:44,554 --> 01:13:45,820
And we're gonna bring them
back here.

1394
01:13:45,822 --> 01:13:46,821
And hopefully,
we'll bring in

1395
01:13:46,823 --> 01:13:48,823
the first girl tonight.

1396
01:13:53,695 --> 01:13:58,466
- You're precious.

1397
01:13:58,468 --> 01:14:01,869
My heart hurts because
you didn't grow up hearing that.

1398
01:14:09,678 --> 01:14:11,112
- Tonight was
the grand opening

1399
01:14:11,114 --> 01:14:13,214
of the genesis project
drop-in center.

1400
01:14:13,216 --> 01:14:17,785
And so they finally, after
eight years of doing this

1401
01:14:17,787 --> 01:14:19,620
and two years of...
In the making,

1402
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:21,022
had a place to go,

1403
01:14:21,024 --> 01:14:23,991
other than
back on the streets.

1404
01:14:23,993 --> 01:14:26,561
So right now,
we're at the genesis project.

1405
01:14:26,563 --> 01:14:28,529
They just got checked in.

1406
01:14:28,531 --> 01:14:30,565
And they're gonna be here,

1407
01:14:30,567 --> 01:14:32,867
taken care of
by the volunteers

1408
01:14:32,869 --> 01:14:34,168
and the staff here.

1409
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:36,938
They're gonna
have food, clothing.

1410
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:38,873
They can have a bed
if they want to sleep.

1411
01:14:38,875 --> 01:14:40,508
They're gonna
get some counseling.

1412
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:42,543
They're gonna get resources
given to them.

1413
01:14:42,545 --> 01:14:44,111
The pimp's in jail.

1414
01:14:44,113 --> 01:14:46,214
We got them out of the life.

1415
01:14:46,216 --> 01:14:48,816
- They're so vulnerable.

1416
01:14:48,818 --> 01:14:51,752
And you know,
I look at their age.

1417
01:14:51,754 --> 01:14:53,788
At 15, I think,

1418
01:14:53,790 --> 01:14:56,824
wow, they should be thinking
about the prom

1419
01:14:56,826 --> 01:14:58,759
or you know, thinking
about their driver's license

1420
01:14:58,761 --> 01:15:00,795
or their first job.

1421
01:15:00,797 --> 01:15:04,499
And that's not even close
to what they're thinking.

1422
01:15:04,501 --> 01:15:06,868
They're just... there's no hope.

1423
01:15:06,870 --> 01:15:09,504
- Finding out that girls
have been going missing,

1424
01:15:09,506 --> 01:15:15,276
I'm just really glad that
it wasn't me, you know.

1425
01:15:15,278 --> 01:15:17,712
- As much as this night
has sucked,

1426
01:15:17,714 --> 01:15:19,814
can you kind of see that
it's a blessing in disguise

1427
01:15:19,816 --> 01:15:21,749
- that you kind of got...
- Mm-hmm.

1428
01:15:21,751 --> 01:15:23,751
- Found, captured,
whatever, arrested?

1429
01:15:23,753 --> 01:15:25,019
- Mm-hmm.

1430
01:15:25,021 --> 01:15:28,723
- Now you're
in the genesis project.

1431
01:15:28,725 --> 01:15:31,592
- Yeah.
I'm... thank you.

1432
01:15:31,594 --> 01:15:34,228
I'm thankful
for everybody here.

1433
01:15:34,230 --> 01:15:36,631
- You're gonna raise
some little girl some day

1434
01:15:36,633 --> 01:15:38,666
the way that
she should be raised

1435
01:15:38,668 --> 01:15:42,036
because you didn't have it
growing up.

1436
01:15:42,038 --> 01:15:44,605
Know what I mean?
- Mm-hmm.

1437
01:15:44,607 --> 01:15:46,574
- And tonight, you can be
a support for your sister,

1438
01:15:46,576 --> 01:15:47,875
and she can be
a support for you.

1439
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:50,244
- Yeah.

1440
01:15:52,247 --> 01:15:53,881
- 'Cause you're a princess.
Remember we talked about that?

1441
01:15:53,883 --> 01:15:57,151
- Hmm. Yeah.
Where's my crown?

1442
01:15:57,153 --> 01:15:58,152
- I'm gonna get... you need
a crown.

1443
01:15:58,154 --> 01:15:59,921
- I need a crown.

1444
01:15:59,923 --> 01:16:01,722
- Next time I see you,
I'm bringing you a crown.

1445
01:16:01,724 --> 01:16:04,058
You need to know that,
that you're a princess.

1446
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:07,762
Because you have a lot of
purpose and a lot of value.

1447
01:16:07,764 --> 01:16:10,631
- I WANT TO SEE GPS
ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES.

1448
01:16:10,633 --> 01:16:12,867
We need safe places here
for these girls.

1449
01:16:12,869 --> 01:16:15,836
And we need to look at them
as victims.

1450
01:16:15,838 --> 01:16:20,007
- And it's just amazing to be
able to see you at this place

1451
01:16:20,009 --> 01:16:21,876
when we've seen
so many other women

1452
01:16:21,878 --> 01:16:24,178
WHO WERE IN THEIR MID 40s
WHO HAVE BEEN IN THIS

1453
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:26,747
since they were 15.

1454
01:16:26,749 --> 01:16:29,050
You're gonna live a much
different life than them.

1455
01:16:29,052 --> 01:16:30,952
- And I know it's not as
comfortable as your other home,

1456
01:16:30,954 --> 01:16:33,154
but there's
some amazing women here

1457
01:16:33,156 --> 01:16:34,722
that have stayed up
all night

1458
01:16:34,724 --> 01:16:36,290
waiting for the first girls
to come in,

1459
01:16:36,292 --> 01:16:37,858
just to be here.

1460
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:38,960
So there's amazing women
in this place

1461
01:16:38,962 --> 01:16:40,294
that want to befriend
you guys

1462
01:16:40,296 --> 01:16:41,596
and have a relationship
with you guys.

1463
01:16:41,598 --> 01:16:43,831
So give them a chance, okay?

1464
01:16:43,833 --> 01:16:45,099
All right.

1465
01:16:45,101 --> 01:16:46,300
- Thanks.
- Well, we love you.

1466
01:16:46,302 --> 01:16:47,702
- Thank you.
- Have a good night.

1467
01:16:47,704 --> 01:16:49,337
- I love you too.
- Good luck.

1468
01:16:49,339 --> 01:16:52,773
- So you'd be interested
in some resources.

1469
01:16:52,775 --> 01:16:54,675
It's called genesis project.

1470
01:16:54,677 --> 01:16:56,611
We take all this time with you
because we do care

1471
01:16:56,613 --> 01:16:58,312
about what happened
to you out here.

1472
01:16:58,314 --> 01:17:00,147
I'd like to introduce you
to some really nice ladies,

1473
01:17:00,149 --> 01:17:04,085
and then they can help get
things going for you.

1474
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:14,061
- Sentencing range as
to promoting

1475
01:17:14,063 --> 01:17:16,330
commercial sexual abuse
of a minor,

1476
01:17:16,332 --> 01:17:20,835
the court will impose
240 months.

1477
01:17:20,837 --> 01:17:22,870
Count two,
promoting prostitution

1478
01:17:22,872 --> 01:17:24,805
in the second degree,

1479
01:17:24,807 --> 01:17:27,341
the court will impose
51 months.

1480
01:17:27,343 --> 01:17:30,011
Arrest count five,
promoting prostitution

1481
01:17:30,013 --> 01:17:32,013
in the first degree,

1482
01:17:32,015 --> 01:17:35,016
the court will impose
108 months.

1483
01:17:35,018 --> 01:17:39,286
Count seven, crime of rape
in the first degree,

1484
01:17:39,288 --> 01:17:42,757
the court will impose
a term of 93 months.

1485
01:18:01,376 --> 01:18:05,379
- The way I got out was...

1486
01:18:05,381 --> 01:18:08,916
I mean,
I tried several times,

1487
01:18:08,918 --> 01:18:10,251
but I guess the way

1488
01:18:10,253 --> 01:18:12,319
I finally got out was
I finally prayed.

1489
01:18:12,321 --> 01:18:17,224
I prayed,
"if my dog is outside,

1490
01:18:17,226 --> 01:18:20,995
I'll know it's safe
to leave."

1491
01:18:20,997 --> 01:18:25,366
And I drove by the house,
she was outside.

1492
01:18:25,368 --> 01:18:27,702
I'm like,
"was that you, God?

1493
01:18:27,704 --> 01:18:29,203
'Cause you don't
just drive away

1494
01:18:29,205 --> 01:18:31,372
from these people, you know."

1495
01:18:31,374 --> 01:18:34,075
And my dog had been hit
by a car earlier

1496
01:18:34,077 --> 01:18:37,812
and was terrified
to get in cars.

1497
01:18:37,814 --> 01:18:40,748
So I said another prayer.

1498
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:46,020
"If she'll get in the car,
then I'll leave."

1499
01:18:46,022 --> 01:18:48,155
So I drove by,
I opened up the car,

1500
01:18:48,157 --> 01:18:53,160
she jumped in without me
calling for her or anything.

1501
01:18:53,162 --> 01:18:54,228
And I left.

1502
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:56,097
And I left with
only my dog.

1503
01:18:56,099 --> 01:18:58,899
I had made Connie over
$1,000,000.

1504
01:18:58,901 --> 01:19:02,036
And I left with my dog,
a torn pair of jeans,

1505
01:19:02,038 --> 01:19:05,740
and a blue and white striped
t-shirt.

1506
01:19:05,742 --> 01:19:07,341
I came all the way out

1507
01:19:07,343 --> 01:19:09,477
to Washington from Florida,

1508
01:19:09,479 --> 01:19:11,212
the farthest away I could go,

1509
01:19:11,214 --> 01:19:13,814
the farthest away
I could drive

1510
01:19:13,816 --> 01:19:18,385
my old red mustang
with my dog in it.

1511
01:19:18,387 --> 01:19:20,521
- So that
I'm out of the life

1512
01:19:20,523 --> 01:19:24,291
and now that I'm in kind
of a journey of healing

1513
01:19:24,293 --> 01:19:26,127
and in a good community,

1514
01:19:26,129 --> 01:19:30,798
I've gotten the incredible
honor to be involved

1515
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:33,868
in a couple anti-trafficking
organizations.

1516
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:35,870
I've gotten a chance
to volunteer,

1517
01:19:35,872 --> 01:19:38,305
even with anti-trafficking
in foreign countries.

1518
01:19:38,307 --> 01:19:40,040
I get to participate
in events

1519
01:19:40,042 --> 01:19:42,209
and speak for other
organizations

1520
01:19:42,211 --> 01:19:44,912
and bring awareness
to what actually goes on.

1521
01:19:44,914 --> 01:19:48,249
I just finished
my master's degree.

1522
01:19:48,251 --> 01:19:50,918
I'm really excited to continue
to work in this movement.

1523
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:52,486
I'm in this
for the rest of my life.

1524
01:19:52,488 --> 01:19:54,355
I survived.
I'm here.

1525
01:19:54,357 --> 01:19:56,056
I don't want any other girl
to go through

1526
01:19:56,058 --> 01:19:57,491
what I had to go through.

1527
01:19:57,493 --> 01:19:59,360
- Decent men,

1528
01:19:59,362 --> 01:20:02,129
decent men who do not buy
people,

1529
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:06,233
who do not buy sex
have to come forward.

1530
01:20:06,235 --> 01:20:08,536
Decent men can
no longer be silent.

1531
01:20:08,538 --> 01:20:11,172
They can no longer
be bystanders.

1532
01:20:11,174 --> 01:20:13,174
- Men are the largest drivers
of demand

1533
01:20:13,176 --> 01:20:15,876
of sex trafficking
around the world today.

1534
01:20:15,878 --> 01:20:17,411
And we need men who will stand
up and say that,

1535
01:20:17,413 --> 01:20:19,513
"I don't stand for that."

1536
01:20:19,515 --> 01:20:22,082
- Men have to challenge each
other and say,

1537
01:20:22,084 --> 01:20:23,851
"enough with this porn.

1538
01:20:23,853 --> 01:20:26,086
Enough with this prostitution."

1539
01:20:26,088 --> 01:20:29,190
And start talking about
what it is to be a real man.

1540
01:20:29,192 --> 01:20:32,393
- There is a girl out there
somewhere who is begging

1541
01:20:32,395 --> 01:20:34,829
that you will see and read
between the lines

1542
01:20:34,831 --> 01:20:36,831
of what she's saying
or not saying.

1543
01:20:36,833 --> 01:20:39,099
And her survival depends
on you

1544
01:20:39,101 --> 01:20:41,068
asking her
the right question.

1545
01:20:41,070 --> 01:20:44,305
- When you see a girl out there,

1546
01:20:44,307 --> 01:20:47,508
don't judge her.

1547
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:51,045
Don't judge her...

1548
01:20:51,047 --> 01:20:53,547
'Cause probably
nine times out of ten,

1549
01:20:53,549 --> 01:20:56,851
she doesn't want
to be there.

1550
01:20:56,853 --> 01:20:59,119
I didn't want to be there.

1551
01:20:59,121 --> 01:21:01,155
I didn't have any strings
holding me

1552
01:21:01,157 --> 01:21:02,857
that you could see,

1553
01:21:02,859 --> 01:21:08,062
but I was pinned down more
than you can imagine.

1554
01:21:08,064 --> 01:21:09,864
Standing out there alone
on the street...

1555
01:21:09,866 --> 01:21:11,532
Yeah, I was pinned down.

1556
01:21:11,534 --> 01:21:13,934
I was trapped.
I was a prisoner.

1557
01:21:13,936 --> 01:21:15,870
I looked like I was free
to come and go,

1558
01:21:15,872 --> 01:21:18,272
but I was not free.

1559
01:21:18,274 --> 01:21:22,076
When you see those girls,
don't you judge them.

1560
01:21:22,078 --> 01:21:24,912
You do everything
you can to help them.

1561
01:21:29,918 --> 01:21:35,923
- ¶ A light inside

1562
01:21:35,925 --> 01:21:40,127
¶ I finally find

1563
01:21:40,129 --> 01:21:45,466
¶ I've become

1564
01:21:45,468 --> 01:21:49,937
¶ I've become

1565
01:21:49,939 --> 01:21:53,974
¶ like you

1566
01:21:59,247 --> 01:22:03,150
¶ make

1567
01:22:03,152 --> 01:22:07,454
¶ your shadow

1568
01:22:07,456 --> 01:22:11,525
¶ dark as the height

1569
01:22:11,527 --> 01:22:16,497
¶ of noon

1570
01:22:16,499 --> 01:22:20,301
¶ wake

1571
01:22:20,303 --> 01:22:24,338
¶ and see

1572
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:27,207
¶ the morning

1573
01:22:27,209 --> 01:22:38,018
¶ makes all things new

1574
01:22:38,043 --> 01:22:42,043
