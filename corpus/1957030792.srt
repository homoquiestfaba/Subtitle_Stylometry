like to share first?

Anyone?

Mariah, please.

1293
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:54,443
I met Joe online.

1294
01:18:57,746 --> 01:18:59,448
I really thought he loved me.

1295
01:19:00,716 --> 01:19:04,954
He talked me into coming
to meet him in Arizona.

1296
01:19:04,988 --> 01:19:08,323
And at first,
everything was perfect.

1297
01:19:08,357 --> 01:19:12,260
He gave me presents,
made me feel special.

1298
01:19:12,294 --> 01:19:17,299
Then he would tell me that
if I didn't do what he asked

1299
01:19:18,968 --> 01:19:20,602
me to do with those other men,

1300
01:19:22,939 --> 01:19:24,606
that I didn't love him.

1301
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:26,675
So, I did whatever he asked

1302
01:19:26,708 --> 01:19:29,578

me sick to my stomach.

1303
01:19:29,611 --> 01:19:32,048
I ran away once and I hid,

1304
01:19:32,081 --> 01:19:36,085
and he tracked me down
and he beat me up.

1305
01:19:36,119 --> 01:19:38,453
But at that time, I
had nowhere to go.

1306

He was all I had.

1307
01:19:47,462 --> 01:19:48,664
After, you took me in.

1308
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:55,370
I had no family, but
then you found me,

1309
