VERY POWERFUL.

1220
01:12:36,418 --> 01:12:37,386
Roy: THAT EXPLAINS
THE ENTIRE COVER-UP.

1221
01:12:37,419 --> 01:12:38,821
IF KENNEDY HAD KNOWN,
HE WOULD HAVE LAUNCHED.

1222
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:42,091
I MEAN, THE BACTERIA IN IT
MUST HAVE AFFECTED
THIS THING'S ANCESTORS,

1223
01:12:42,124 --> 01:12:45,961
AND THE MUTATION
HAS COMPOUNDED
OVER EACH GENERATION.

1224
01:12:45,994 --> 01:12:48,430
WELL, EXPLAINING ITS
INCREDIBLE GOOD LOOKS

1225
01:12:48,464 --> 01:12:52,201
AND, UH, GOOD NATURE OF
OUR LITTLE FRIEND, YEAH.

1226
01:12:52,234 --> 01:12:54,169
HA HA HA!

1227
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:55,370
AND AS FAR AS I CAN TELL,

1228
01:12:55,404 --> 01:12:59,007
THIS THING ALSO SUFFERS FROM
AN EXTREME IRON DEFICIENCY.

1229
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:00,776
HENCE THE OVERAGGRESSIVE
BEHAVIOR.

1230
01:13:00,809 --> 01:13:01,777
UH-HUH.

1231
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:04,613
NOW,
IT'S NOT JUST A MUTANT,
BUT IT'S ANEMIC?

1232
01:13:04,646 --> 01:13:08,016
YEAH. CONSIDERING ITS SIZE,
ARE YOU KIDDING?

1233
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:09,151
THIS THING
HAS A CRAVING FOR MEAT

1234
01:13:09,184 --> 01:13:11,153
THAT WOULD SCARE A COW
OUT OF ITS SKIN.

1235
01:13:11,186 --> 01:13:12,488
WHITE MEAT
OR DARK MEAT?

1236
01:13:12,521 --> 01:13:14,590
OK. IF THIS CREATURE
NEEDS MEAT,

1237
01:13:14,623 --> 01:13:17,192
THEN THAT MEANS
THERE'S A WAY
WE CAN BAIT IT, RIGHT?

1238
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:22,097
UH, SO, WHAT?
YOU SUGGESTING
WE DRAW STRAWS?

1239
01:13:22,131 --> 01:13:23,465
NO. NOT QUITE.
WHAT I'M SAYING IS

1240
01:13:23,499 --> 01:13:26,034
THAT THERE MAY BE
ENOUGH TIME FOR US
TO BUY OURSELVES SOME TIME

1241
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:28,137
AND GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE
WITH THAT SUBMERSIBLE.

1242
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:29,538
YEAH, I GOT A GREAT IDEA.

1243
01:13:29,571 --> 01:13:31,607
WHY DON'T WE GET AHOLD
OF SOME T-BONES, AND
WE CAST OUT SOME LINES?

1244

Shaw: WHAT THE HELL
IS THAT?

1248
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:40,516
IT'S A HIGH POTENCY MIX
OF AMINO ACIDS
AND MINERALS,

1249
01:13:40,549 --> 01:13:41,350
SPECIFICALLY IRON.

1250
01:13:41,383 --> 01:13:43,852
I USE IT TO FEED
DOLPHINS AND WHALES.

1251
01:13:43,886 --> 01:13:46,054
MM-MMM. FLIPPER FOOD.

1252
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:48,056
SEE, NOW,
YOU'RE LOSING ME.

1253
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:48,924
OK, LISTEN,
IT IS THE PROTEIN

1254
01:13:48,957 --> 01:13:51,093
THAT THIS THING
IS AFTER, NOT US, OK?

1255
01:13:51,126 --> 01:13:53,595
I MEAN, IT COULD SUCK
ON A BOTTLE OF THIS
FOR HOURS.

1256
01:13:53,629 --> 01:13:54,963
Roy: OK, THAT'S IT, THEN.

1257
01:13:54,997 --> 01:13:56,031
WE PUT A LITTLE BIT OF THIS
IN ONE OF THE SHIP'S
COMPARTMENTS,

1258
01:13:56,064 --> 01:13:59,201
WE LEAD THE CREATURE TO IT,
AND WE LET IT FEED.

1259
01:13:59,234 --> 01:14:00,102
BINGO.

1260
01:14:00,135 --> 01:14:01,670
WELL, LISTEN, I HATE
TO BRING THIS UP,

1261
01:14:01,703 --> 01:14:03,071
BUT WE HAVE, WHAT,
18 MINUTES

1262

PHYSICAL DANGER.

I'M ABOUT TO FIND OUT.
