I need a vacation.

You too, huh?

16
00:05:09,134 --> 00:05:13,965
I'm really bummed.
Today Derek is leaving,
and so are my parents.

17
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:16,620
First you complain that
your parents aren't together,

18
00:05:16,794 --> 00:05:18,709
and now that they are
together, you're still
complaining.

00:05:18,883 --> 00:05:21,408
At least you have
both parents.

20
00:05:21,582 --> 00:05:25,194
Besides, your babysitter
is hot.

I'd rather be bound and gagged
than be taken care of by her.

are really traumatic for me.

-I'm really gonna miss her.
-Did you tell him?

heard about our past.

as him, but I have some
tricks up my sleeve.

eat breakfast.

00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:28,611
Please stay?

667
00:46:30,309 --> 00:46:31,266
Well...

668
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,964
Please?

669
00:46:33,138 --> 00:46:35,923
[STAMMERING]
Well, I'll think about it.

670
00:46:36,097 --> 00:46:37,795
Let's...
Let's dig in first, huh?

671
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:45,628
Well, I haven't gotten to tell
you about the concert yet.

672
00:46:47,152 --> 00:46:49,719
Uh... So, tell me.

673
00:46:49,894 --> 00:46:51,460
It's gonna be really cool.

674
00:46:55,508 --> 00:46:56,465
Are you listening?

675
00:46:58,119 --> 00:46:59,729
-Hmm?
-You okay?

676
00:46:59,904 --> 00:47:01,993
Oh, yeah. I'm fine, I'm sorry.

677
00:47:03,385 --> 00:47:05,735
So tell me about this...

678
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:08,869
-Concert.
-Concert, yeah.

679
00:47:09,043 --> 00:47:12,090
So, there are gonna be way
cool bands there.

680
00:47:12,264 --> 00:47:15,267
And one of them is so cool,
you know, they've been my
favorite forever, and...

681
00:47:22,317 --> 00:47:24,711
What happened here?
It looks like someone died
or something.

682
00:47:24,885 --> 00:47:28,846
Just as bad. Here.

683
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,848
It says they're tearing
this place down.

684
00:47:31,022 --> 00:47:33,851
But how can they do that?
I mean, it's our clubhouse.

685
00:47:34,025 --> 00:47:35,983
Yeah, but they don't know
that, dummy.

686
00:47:36,157 --> 00:47:37,550
Don't call me dummy.

687
00:47:39,378 --> 00:47:40,683
When did this come?

688
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,947
It was on the front door
this morning.

689
00:47:43,121 --> 00:47:45,166
According to this, they're
demolishing our place in less
than a week.

690
00:47:46,689 --> 00:47:48,604
So what are we going to do?

691
00:47:48,778 --> 00:47:50,432
Maybe we can fight this.

692
00:47:50,606 --> 00:47:53,218
Fight the city?
We don't have the time.

693
00:47:53,392 --> 00:47:55,220
We've got a concert coming up.

694
00:47:55,394 --> 00:47:57,135
I don't know,
there might be a way.

695
00:47:57,309 --> 00:47:59,485
-Guys.
-Maybe my cousin can
help us out.

696
00:47:59,659 --> 00:48:01,139
He has a place downtown.

697
00:48:01,313 --> 00:48:02,967
Oh great, Rico, how are we
gonna get there?

698
00:48:03,141 --> 00:48:05,621
-Guys!
-We could take the bus.

699
00:48:05,795 --> 00:48:08,624
And carry all our gear, huh?
That plan stinks,
that's stupid.

700
00:48:08,798 --> 00:48:10,061
-Guys!
-BOTH: What?

701
00:48:10,235 --> 00:48:11,540
Why don't we just fix
the problem?

702
00:48:11,714 --> 00:48:13,238
What do you mean?

703
00:48:13,412 --> 00:48:15,153
Go to the source.
The Building Department.

704
00:48:15,327 --> 00:48:17,329
Oh, yeah.

705
00:48:17,503 --> 00:48:19,635
And all we have to do is get
into their files.

706
00:48:19,809 --> 00:48:21,942
Their computer files!

707
00:48:22,116 --> 00:48:24,336
-And bingo.
-No more eviction.

going to be in town another 
couple of days.

00:48:40,308 --> 00:48:42,615
Did you complete
the transfers?

712
00:48:42,789 --> 00:48:45,444
The wire transfers.

713
00:48:45,618 --> 00:48:48,534
Yes, I'm going to need
confirmation that the funds
did go from their account

714
00:48:48,708 --> 00:48:51,972
into my Cayman account.

715
00:48:52,146 --> 00:48:56,368
Yes, it would be unfortunate
if the money stayed in their
accounts.

716
00:48:56,542 --> 00:49:01,025
No, no, I think it's better
that we let them squirm.

717
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:05,116
And yes, we will be getting
rid of that concert promoter
as soon as we can.

718
00:49:06,726 --> 00:49:09,250
All right. Good.

MARLA:  So, Tedesco 
put all this money

721
00:49:17,911 --> 00:49:20,914
in a Swiss bank account to 
frame my dad and the Captain.

722
00:49:21,088 --> 00:49:23,003
You know, I think Wyatt was 
really the only one

723
00:49:23,177 --> 00:49:25,310
that didn't believe that 
Zipper guy.

724
00:49:25,484 --> 00:49:27,921
Wyatt had this Internet dude 
named Record Boy 
check him out.

725
00:49:33,796 --> 00:49:35,407
None of this makes any sense.

726
00:49:38,497 --> 00:49:40,673
This is crazy.

to frame him.

to get to him.

734
00:50:10,311 --> 00:50:11,182
for Marla's sake.

735
00:50:15,577 --> 00:50:18,754

Department office that we need
to get into.

Good. I've got everything
we need.

00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,199

is gonna go?

Why can't we all go?

caught, doofus.

I think Rico and I
should go.

forget what Marla did on the
last mission.

dad's computer at the police
station

748
00:50:46,782 --> 00:50:51,004

It was quite embarrassing.

Greetings, Cobras, nice to 
meet you.

He loves to discover

in public.

He supports five different 
youth charities and two 
orphanages.

00:51:27,432 --> 00:51:28,781
He seems like a man of honor, 
your Bransom.

00:51:28,955 --> 00:51:30,174
Anyway, that's all I have 
for now.

00:51:30,348 --> 00:51:32,132
Whoa, how'd you get
all that info?

767
00:51:32,306 --> 00:51:33,829

be so secretive.

I get into records. That's why 
they call me Record Boy.

be for your cool sounds.

play a song?

a short one.

to the station.

01:09:02,225 --> 01:09:04,314
Well, even you,
Mr. police chief,

992
01:09:04,488 --> 01:09:08,405
have to admit that my little
plan is, shall we say,
flawless.

993
01:09:08,579 --> 01:09:12,583
The poor distraught
police captain, upset over him
and his partner,

994
01:09:12,757 --> 01:09:15,629
of course, Detective Beddinger
being caught embezzling,

995
01:09:15,803 --> 01:09:18,415
decides out of sheer
desperation

996
01:09:18,589 --> 01:09:22,288
to save the
unfortunate daughter of
Beddinger from all the pain

997
01:09:22,462 --> 01:09:26,423
and humiliation by dispensing
of both of their lives
at the same time.

998
01:09:26,597 --> 01:09:32,080
[CHUCKLES] Do you like that?
Sort of like a storyline
from a movie, isn't it?

999
01:09:32,255 --> 01:09:34,779
A little overly dramatic
perhaps, but I
would say effective!

1000
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:40,654
-What the going on here?
-I'm tying up some loose ends.

1001
01:09:40,828 --> 01:09:43,091
Little Miss Beddinger got her
fingers caught
in the cookie jar.

1002
01:09:43,266 --> 01:09:45,877
She almost got her hands
on our transactions.

1003
01:09:46,051 --> 01:09:49,097
All right,
you have your papers.
Now let them go.

1004
01:09:49,272 --> 01:09:53,232
Why, does she remind you
of some other little girl?

1005
01:09:53,406 --> 01:09:57,105
-What girl?
-You know, the little girl in
the picture, your daughter.

1006
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:59,325
What do you know about her?

1007
01:09:59,499 --> 01:10:01,109
Hmm.

1008
01:10:01,284 --> 01:10:05,113
Listen. Don't even
think about it.

1009
01:10:05,288 --> 01:10:08,943
Besides, I don't know where
she is and I bet
you don't either.

1010
01:10:09,117 --> 01:10:12,947
You know, I make it my point
to know everything I can
about my employees.

1011
01:10:13,121 --> 01:10:15,167
Of course, you could
never have found her.

1012
01:10:15,341 --> 01:10:18,257
It took me about a
second to find out where
the little tyke was.

1013
01:10:18,431 --> 01:10:23,175
I'll put it
to you this way, it's either
Beddinger's kid or yours!

1014
01:10:23,349 --> 01:10:27,701
-You've gone too far!
-You wanna see your daughter
again, you leave me alone!

1015
01:10:27,875 --> 01:10:31,401
Now look, as soon as I get my
money, I'm gonna set them free
and I'll forget all

1016
01:10:31,575 --> 01:10:32,750
about your daughter.

1017
01:10:34,882 --> 01:10:37,363
There we go.

1018
01:10:37,537 --> 01:10:39,844
And if you talk, you're gonna
end up over there
with your friends.

1019
01:10:42,150 --> 01:10:45,023
I don't want any part of this.

1020
01:10:45,197 --> 01:10:50,420
You made a big mistake messing
with me. Now, I'll ask you
one more time!

1021
01:10:50,594 --> 01:10:54,641
-Let them go!
-You're in no position to
be giving orders.

1022
01:10:54,815 --> 01:10:59,080
Now get out!
Or you'll never see
your daughter again.

1023
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:02,127
Get him out of here.
I said escort him out.

1024
01:11:18,361 --> 01:11:20,058
[HUMMING]

1025
01:11:20,232 --> 01:11:23,104
Kind of late,
aren't we, Sedgwick?

1026
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:24,889
Make a wrong turn
or something?

1027
01:11:25,063 --> 01:11:28,153
Quit razzing me.
It is still early.

1028
01:11:28,327 --> 01:11:30,895
We've been up for
quite a while.

1029
01:11:31,069 --> 01:11:35,508
-Mr. Early Bird Sedgwick.
-George, make him stop.

1030
01:11:35,682 --> 01:11:39,207
Louie! Right, Sedgwick, what
do you have for us?

1031
01:11:39,382 --> 01:11:42,820
Well, let's see, I got two
stray cats, garden snake,

1032
01:11:44,387 --> 01:11:46,867
cockatoo!

1033
01:11:47,041 --> 01:11:51,524
[STAMMERING] And this
spotty one here.

1034
01:11:51,698 --> 01:11:54,484
What's she doing here?
Sedgwick, where did
you find her?

1035
01:11:54,658 --> 01:11:58,139
Out 'round Taylor Pass,
she looked kind of lost to me.

1036
01:11:58,314 --> 01:12:00,577
Hey, girl,
where's your master?

1037
01:12:00,751 --> 01:12:02,709
No, something's
not right here.

1038
01:12:02,883 --> 01:12:06,496
Yeah, Marla would never let
Vulcan out alone.

1039
01:12:06,670 --> 01:12:10,108
-What are we gonna do, George?
-Oh, I think we should
call the Cobras.

1040
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:15,461
-The Cobras?
-Yeah.

1041
01:12:15,635 --> 01:12:19,204
Something's gotta be wrong.
I just called her and
no one answered.

1042
01:12:19,378 --> 01:12:22,860
-Okay, I'll see you in a few.
-Hey, pal, you ready yet?

1043
01:12:23,034 --> 01:12:25,776
-Ready for what?
-We're going to Grandma's
for her birthday.

1044
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:28,779
-I hope you at least
got her a card.
-Dad, you must've

1045
01:12:28,953 --> 01:12:31,216
forgotten to tell me.

1046
01:12:31,390 --> 01:12:36,003
-I can't go.
-Why, you'll break her heart.
Come on, you got two minutes.

1047
01:12:36,177 --> 01:12:39,790
-I already promised my friend.
-Wyatt, you're starting to
upset me.

1048
01:12:39,964 --> 01:12:42,575
Now, I'm gonna count to three
for you to change your mind.

1049
01:12:42,749 --> 01:12:45,665
One. Two.

1050
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:49,452
-Two and a half...
-Three!

1051
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:54,500
You leave me
no choice, young man.

1052
01:12:54,674 --> 01:12:55,980
I'm gonna do something
I've never done before.

1053
01:12:56,154 --> 01:12:58,765
I'm... I...

1054
01:13:01,768 --> 01:13:05,816
Can't say it. This is gonna
hurt me a lot more than it's
gonna hurt you.

1055
01:13:12,823 --> 01:13:16,914
I can't believe you
made me do that.
I will see you downstairs.

1056
01:13:21,875 --> 01:13:23,747
[SIGHS]
Sorry, Dad, but I gotta
do what's right.

1057
01:13:32,843 --> 01:13:34,279
Marla!

1058
01:13:40,807 --> 01:13:42,418
Hello! Anybody ho...

1059
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:47,379
Marla. Oh, man. Marla! Marla!

1060
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:53,690
Marla! Captain!
Oh, man, Marla's in trouble.

1061
01:14:05,528 --> 01:14:11,055
-I hope Marla's okay.
-Yeah, I know what you mean.
I hope Ralph's okay too.

1062
01:14:11,229 --> 01:14:13,057
But he, uh, got adopted today.

1063
01:14:13,231 --> 01:14:16,408
-Some big movie producer.
-You let Ralph go!

1064
01:14:16,582 --> 01:14:21,021
-Hey, guys, I had no choice.
-What a chump.

1065
01:14:21,195 --> 01:14:25,417
-Hey, you know the difference
between a chump and a chimp?
-You.

[LAUGHING]

1067
01:14:28,376 --> 01:14:31,815
This is no time for jokes.
What about Marla?

1068
01:14:31,989 --> 01:14:33,425
-Hey, guys.
-What took you so long?

1069
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:35,253
-I stopped at Marla's house.
-Is she okay?

1070
01:14:35,427 --> 01:14:37,560
No one was there and the
place was a mess.

1071
01:14:37,734 --> 01:14:40,476
-Something happened to
her and the Captain.
-This isn't cool.

1072
01:14:40,650 --> 01:14:42,869
Yeah, and our concert starts
in a few hours.

1073
01:14:43,043 --> 01:14:45,002
What's wrong with you? How can
you think about the stupid

1074
01:14:45,176 --> 01:14:46,786
concert when Marla's
in trouble?

1075
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,875
-I'm not, I was just talking.
-GEORGE: Whoa, kids...

1076
01:14:49,049 --> 01:14:51,095
Quit bickering, we gotta
come up with a plan.

1077
01:14:51,269 --> 01:14:53,401
Let's call the cops.

1078
01:14:53,576 --> 01:14:55,752
I already did that and they
said the Captain
was on vacation.

1079
01:14:55,926 --> 01:14:58,711
And we couldn't do anything
about Marla for 24 hours.

1080
01:14:58,885 --> 01:15:01,235
-Oh, great.
-What are we gonna do?

1081
01:15:01,409 --> 01:15:03,150
I have an idea.
Captain has a pager.

1082
01:15:03,324 --> 01:15:04,848
If we track his pager,
we should be able

1083
01:15:05,022 --> 01:15:06,850
-to get a fix on his location.
-You can do that?

1084
01:15:07,024 --> 01:15:09,069
I think I remember
the phone number...

1085
01:15:14,553 --> 01:15:18,470
Next I uplink to Telecon's
satellite and put a track
on his pager.

1086
01:15:18,644 --> 01:15:20,428
COMPUTER:  All systems ready.

1087
01:15:20,603 --> 01:15:22,430
Then I use the satellite
to track his location.

1088
01:15:24,563 --> 01:15:28,567
-Almost. Almost. Darn!
-What? What happened?

1089
01:15:28,741 --> 01:15:30,743
I don't know.
The satellite was tracking,

1090
01:15:30,917 --> 01:15:32,832
but it said the unit
isn't receiving.

1091
01:15:33,006 --> 01:15:35,574
-What does that mean?
-It means that
his pager's off.

1092
01:15:35,748 --> 01:15:39,273
-Or the batteries are dead.
-Or they're dead.

1093
01:15:39,447 --> 01:15:41,885
-They can't be dead.
-You've tried everything.

1094
01:15:42,059 --> 01:15:44,757
I'm not giving up, understand?

1095
01:15:44,931 --> 01:15:46,585
Let me try something.

1096
01:15:52,765 --> 01:15:55,289
I think I got it.

1097
01:15:55,463 --> 01:15:57,814
-What did you do?
-I retraced the last time his
pager went off with

1098
01:15:57,988 --> 01:16:01,252
his cellular company's pager.
Let's just hope the
address is correct.

01:20:06,149 --> 01:20:08,368
-Yeah, we had to come
rescue you.
-Cobras to the rescue.

1148
01:20:11,850 --> 01:20:14,853
Go! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1149
01:20:28,214 --> 01:20:29,868
ZIPPER: We took in
a lot of money.

1150
01:20:33,785 --> 01:20:36,962
Mr. Bransom. I wasn't
expecting to see you here.

1151
01:20:37,136 --> 01:20:40,226
No one really knows what to
expect from me, do they?

1152
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:47,103
-May I offer you a drink?
-No, but there is, uh,
something you can get for me.

1153
01:20:47,277 --> 01:20:49,453
Mr. Bransom, I tried to
get the kids. I don't know
what happened to them.

1154
01:20:49,627 --> 01:20:53,805
Shut up! I am not interested
in these stupid kids.

1155
01:20:53,979 --> 01:20:56,416
Why would I care about some
snotty nosed children?

1156
01:20:56,590 --> 01:21:00,072
I am here for something
much more important.
Now hand me that briefcase.

1157
01:21:02,553 --> 01:21:04,076
Come on! Hand over the money!

1158
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:11,040
Now, you see, we have you and
your boy compromised here,

1159
01:21:11,214 --> 01:21:14,304
and I have a bullet with your
name on it aimed
right at your temple.

1160
01:21:14,478 --> 01:21:18,090
If I were you, I would just be
a good little boy and not
give me any trouble. Okay?

1161
01:21:24,705 --> 01:21:25,663
Please...

1162
01:21:27,230 --> 01:21:29,580
Allow me to introduce myself.

1163
01:21:31,408 --> 01:21:34,933
My name is Clive Bransom.

1164
01:21:35,107 --> 01:21:40,069
All this play acting
is becoming extremely tedious.

1165
01:21:46,031 --> 01:21:49,513
I think it's time to flush
the rats from the sewer.

1166
01:21:53,082 --> 01:21:54,910
And get this one
right out of my sight.

1167
01:21:59,610 --> 01:22:01,917
[SIGHS]
Thank God that's over.

1168
01:22:05,007 --> 01:22:08,314
You wouldn't happen to have
a job for me, would you?

1169
01:22:08,488 --> 01:22:14,320
[SHUSHES] You just make sure
that all that money gets to
the right people.

1170
01:22:27,420 --> 01:22:30,946
Ah... Amateurs.

1171
01:22:38,083 --> 01:22:40,999
MARLA:  Record Boy turned out 
to be the real Clive Bransom.

1172
01:22:41,173 --> 01:22:43,523
Now we get to 
record a real song.

1173
01:22:43,697 --> 01:22:46,613
Dad and the Captain got 
off the hook. 
I miss you, Derek,

1174
01:22:46,787 --> 01:22:49,703
and I'll write 
you more tomorrow. 
Bye for now.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

1176
01:23:12,813 --> 01:23:13,945
Good morning.

1177
01:23:21,387 --> 01:23:24,782
I am Clive Bransom.

1178
01:23:24,956 --> 01:23:28,177
Oh, no, not again.

1179
01:23:28,351 --> 01:23:31,919
[SIGHS]
Sorry, mister, but we've heard
that one already.

1180
01:23:33,443 --> 01:23:36,054
Ah, right. Well then...

1181
01:23:37,621 --> 01:23:40,928
Perhaps this will help.

1182
01:23:44,758 --> 01:23:48,240
Clive Bransom.

1183
01:23:48,414 --> 01:23:52,375
I hate to tell you this,
mister, but my brother
once had a card that said

1184
01:23:52,549 --> 01:23:54,768
Santa Claus.

1185
01:23:54,942 --> 01:23:56,248
Man, we think you're
just another fake.

1186
01:23:58,598 --> 01:24:03,125
Well, now that creates a
rather unique problem.

1187
01:24:03,299 --> 01:24:06,171
-I have never had to prove
who I am before.
-There's always a first.

1188
01:24:18,618 --> 01:24:23,928
You must be
Space Cowboy.

1189
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:28,846
I think I'd better start
from the beginning.

1190
01:24:31,022 --> 01:24:33,938
It's true that my name
is Clive Bransom,

1191
01:24:36,723 --> 01:24:42,555
but you might now me
better as Record Boy.

1192
01:24:42,729 --> 01:24:45,645
Record Boy?

1193
01:24:45,819 --> 01:24:48,735
And it's been a pleasure
talking to you all these
last months.

1194
01:24:48,909 --> 01:24:52,870
As a matter of fact, I feel
like I know each and
every one of you.

1195
01:24:55,481 --> 01:24:56,656
You're Timothy.

1196
01:24:58,180 --> 01:24:59,964
A bit of a scamp, I hear,

1197
01:25:00,138 --> 01:25:03,446
but with a voice that is
sweeter than anything.

1198
01:25:05,274 --> 01:25:08,059
Are you really Clive Bransom?

1199
01:25:08,233 --> 01:25:12,672
Ah, now it's Mr. Rico
I presume.

1200
01:25:12,846 --> 01:25:16,589
-One and the same.
-I hear that you lay down
one mean rap.

1201
01:25:17,938 --> 01:25:19,201
Not bad.

1202
01:25:20,724 --> 01:25:21,899
Ah...

1203
01:25:26,686 --> 01:25:31,387
And you, of course, are Marla.

1204
01:25:31,561 --> 01:25:34,781
Now, I've heard quite
a bit about you.

1205
01:25:34,955 --> 01:25:38,698
It's nice to meet you,
Mr. Bransom.

1206
01:25:38,872 --> 01:25:43,268
And I would like to say that I
have never met a more
tenacious group

1207
01:25:43,442 --> 01:25:47,142
of young people than you.
In fact, if my entire
organization was made up of

1208
01:25:47,316 --> 01:25:50,710
kids like you, I'd be...

1209
01:25:50,884 --> 01:25:53,887
I'd be, uh,
even richer than I am today.

1210
01:25:54,061 --> 01:25:59,154
-Which is stinkin' rich...
Sir.
-That's right.

1211
01:25:59,328 --> 01:26:01,939
I think that now we ought to
get down to business.

1212
01:26:03,767 --> 01:26:06,596
-The record business.
-Yeah!

Hey, sweetie. Oh, God, it's
good to be back home.

Everything back
to normal now, huh?

1218
01:26:41,674 --> 01:26:44,895
You know, we drove right by
the school, noticed there's
a bulldozer out front.

1219
01:26:45,069 --> 01:26:47,550
I didn't know they were
tearing down that place.
