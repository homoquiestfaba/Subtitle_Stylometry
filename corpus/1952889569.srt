00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:27,569
Dead Sexy
thriller,2001

3
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,645
Are you more relaxed now?

4
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,627
-How should l do it?
-What?

5
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:15,714
-Chalk. How do l draw a body on water?
-You should've brought your watercolours.

6
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:19,134
Twenty-seven years on the force
and l never got to swim on the job.

7
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:20,928
Nice night for it, Steve.

8
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,514
-Here, before you catch a cold.
-Thanks.

9
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:25,641
-You McBain?
-Yeah.

10
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,351
Detective Keith Rackles.

11
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,896
Captain Snyder said you'd be here.
He didn't say you looked this good.

12
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,023
You shouldn't have told me either.

13
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:34,650
So?

14
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,821
-What you got?
-She fell from somewhere up there.

15
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:42,449
Busted her nose on the bottom of the pool.

16
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:45,702
Good thing she hit the water,
otherwise we'd have a real mess.

17
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:51,375
Hey, you.
You shooting for P.D. or Playboy?

18
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,460
-What shall l do with the body?
-Just--

19
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:57,256
Go ahead and fish her out
and get me a sample of the lipstick.

20
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:58,423
You got it.

21
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:02,761
Lipstick.

22
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:06,265
Look, all l'm saying is,
this is my crime scene.

23
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:10,602
You're the new kid in town,
so you need to sit back and take notes.

24
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:14,439
Really. l never sit back.
And l left my pen with your modesty.

25
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:17,109
l've had experience
handling women like you before.

26
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,069
-Yeah, who?
-My ex-fiancée.

27
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:20,904
That explains the "ex."

28
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:25,367
-Get a load of this fucking place, Rackles.
-Billy, what are you doing here?

29
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:29,246
Waiting to meet the girl of my dreams.
Where did you find this one?

30
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,791
That's Detective McBain.
Just transferred down from Frisco.

31
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,085
You get tired of the cold weather?

32
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,712
No. Just the idiots.

33
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:40,883
You'll have to excuse Billy,
he hasn't quite evolved yet.

34
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:41,925
So what's up?

35
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,719
Well, the bed's been slept in...

36
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:46,555
...her clothes are on the floor
and then there's this.

37
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:52,895
Was she alone?

38
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:56,857
-Desk clerk says she checked in alone.
-Neighbours see anyone coming or going?

39
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,151
-Nobody saw nothing.
-Sounds like a jumper.

40
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:01,862
Girls go nuts for champagne.

41
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:04,489
Yeah, and every dick thinks he's a Romeo.

42
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,034
Well, l wouldn't know about that.

43
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,497
Her name's Georgia Gaines,
investment broker.

44
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:15,250
Single. No boyfriend. Never been married.

45
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:17,711
Front desk said she checked in alone.

46
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:21,381
And no one saw anyone
entering or leaving her room.

47
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,926
What do we have on the girl?

48
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,386
Her neck was broken, probably on impact.

49
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:30,933
Her only possessions were her coat
and her handbag which contained...

50
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:34,520
...a change purse and some makeup,
an empty clasped envelope...

51
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:36,480
...and a champagne bottle...

52
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,982
...and one glass, her lipstick on it.

53
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,026
Textbook jumper.

54
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:45,322
-You know girls when they get hormonal.
-Good work, Detective.

55
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:48,200
-You got something to say, McBain?
-Yeah.

56
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:49,785
l think she was pushed.

57
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:52,538
By who, the lnvisible Man?

58
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,540
The champagne bottle was half empty.

59
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:58,585
The coroner told me the blood-alcohol level
showed she only had about one glass.

60
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:02,214
Well, maybe she nursed
the same bottle for hours.

61
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:05,217
The medical examiner also found
high levels...

62
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:08,971
...of methylenedioxymethamphetamine
in her system: MDMA.

63
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,098
The love drug.

64
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:13,267
"Methy" what?

65
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,227
Ecstasy.

66
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,690
She would not have taken ecstasy
if she'd planned on being alone.

67
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:24,611
Well, maybe her date didn't show up
and she grabbed some pills and...

68
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:28,574
...washed it down with a little bubbly
and said bye-bye to the single life.

69
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:31,618
Do you think Georgia Gaines
is the only one with this M.O.?

70
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:37,082
Robin Stone, six months ago, downtown.

71
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:40,335
Dee Phillips, Manhattan Beach, last month.

72
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:44,173
Both blonde, young,
beautiful investment brokers...

73
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:47,050
...found dead in a hotel room,
wearing lingerie.

74
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,595
No prints in the room except theirs.

75
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,140
Both sipping champagne
and popping ecstasy.

76
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:57,144
Where'd you find the time to dig this up?

77
00:07:57,352 --> 00:08:01,273
They were also both wearing lipstick
that was smudged over by another lipstick.

78
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,066
l took samples of the smudge...

79
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,028
...and compared it to the one
Georgia Gaines was wearing.

80
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:09,031
lt came up with a three-way match:
Burgeon Rouge.

81
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:13,118
lt's a lipstick imported and distributed
by a small company called Antoinette.

82
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:17,331
Three girls turn up dead
wearing the same shade of lipstick.

83
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,333
lt's more than just a coincidence.

84
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,627
l think the workings of a serial killer.

85
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:24,379
Robin Stone was your case, Rackles.

86
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:27,799
What would l know about lipstick?

87
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:31,094
l want you to find out more about this girl
and put out an APB...

88
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:34,806
...in case another victim
with the same kind of evidence turns up.

89
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:40,896
l don't want to hear of another incident like
the one you started with Detective Trainer.

90
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:41,772
l started?

91
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,399
l want you to keep your emotions in check.

92
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,902
ls that clear, Detective?

93
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:49,571
Yes, sir.

94
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:53,450
Now get the hell out of here, all of you.

95
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,457
l don't believe this. He started it.

96
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,126
He's a rookie, he doesn't know any better.

97
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,504
You've got to learn to just blend in.

98
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:06,922
Blend in?

99
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:09,842
-l don't have a $1,000 watch.
-Try $5,000.

100
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,845
How does a rookie cop get a $5,000 watch?

101
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:15,889
Let's just say,
rich kid who wanted to be a cop.

102
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,914
God, that is good.

103
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:31,270
l guess that APB worked.

104
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:36,275
Malibu precinct called me right away.
The victim is Heather LeBow, 24.

105
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:39,486
Colorado driver's license.
UCLA student lD.

106
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:42,239
She was wearing that
"Baton Rouge" lipstick.

107
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,241
Burgeon Rouge.

108
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,494
-l suppose you know that.
-Stop spitting, it's a crime scene.

109
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:49,496
What do you want me to do, swallow?

110
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,793
What do you have, Steve?

111
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:59,089
Her neck's broken, ribs are broken...

112
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,676
...hip is shattered,
abrasions around the throat.

113
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:06,513
l need to know if she was strangled
before she was thrown off the cliff.

114
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:08,932
Check the neck abrasions
for any traces of fabric.

115
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:11,643
l'm looking for a scarf or gloves.

116
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:15,480
-Follow me back to the station?
-Would "no" be out of the question?

117
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:17,566
Secure the area. Put an officer on it.

118
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:22,070
l want impressions of all the tyre marks,
footprints, treads, anything you can find.

119
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:22,905
Gotcha.

120
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:25,532
Won't do you any good to argue with her.

121
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:28,827
What's he doing here?

122
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:33,749
He came to help secure the crime scene
and watch the show.

123
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:41,256
Get off my car.

124
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:52,643
The girls were all strangled.
They all had sex with the same man.

125
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:56,688
The medical examiner found fibres of black
leather in the abrasions on their neck.

126
00:14:56,772 --> 00:14:59,441
We're thinking a pair of gloves.
We found this.

127
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:04,488
lt's a tape found in the answering machine
of our cliff-jumper, Heather LeBow.

128
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:09,117
<i>-...tower. Good evening.
-Hello?

129
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:10,536
<i>Hello?

130
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,665
-So?
-lt was the last phone call before she died.

131
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:17,459
The caller hung up
a few seconds after she picked up.

132
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:20,420
-The caller wanted to see if she was home?
-Apparently so.

133
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:24,132
We're going to have it digitally enhanced
so we can identify the clicking.

134
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:26,426
And then there's this.

135
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:34,560
l cross-referenced the numbers
in the girls' personal telephone books.

136
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:38,063
l came up with one number the same,
different names next to it.

137
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:42,943
Paul and Peter both at 555-2808.
And Pancho at 555-2808.

138
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:44,987
Phil at 555-2808.

139
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:50,325
So l'm going to run a check on the number
to find out who it really belongs to.

140
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:51,827
What is it?

141
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,708
"Call Pat at 555-2808."

142
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:06,902
Hello?

143
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:36,390
Detective McBain?

144
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:37,975
Who are you?

145
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:40,352
l'm Pat. Pat Pollard.

146
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:44,231
You're Pat? l thought....

147
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:47,359
My assistant called you.
l've been expecting you.

148
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:51,029
Do you want to put that thing away
so that we can talk?

149
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:53,991
Go ahead. l'm listening.

150
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:55,534
Four women are dead.

151
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:58,662
They've been listed
in the obituaries as suicides.

152
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:02,708
But you might want to look at it further.

153
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,334
l can help you.

154
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:07,880
<i>But it has to be kept confidential.

155
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:10,674
<i>All right. You and me.

156
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,385
<i>Come into my office.

157
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:19,766
Have a seat.

158
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:26,565
Do you drink a lot of champagne?

159
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,318
lt was a gift
from one of my antiques dealers.

160
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:31,778
l have a warehouse full of old furniture...

161
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,448
...but that's not my main business.

162
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:35,949
The four girls?

163
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:38,285
They were my girls.

164
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:40,078
So, you are a madam?

165
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:44,625
lt all started out quite accidentally
at one of my parties.

166
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:50,589
A rich diplomat met one of my friends,
a beautiful, young, former Miss Louisiana...

167
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:53,675
...who was studying
Business Administration at UCLA.

168
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,512
They both got pretty drunk...

169
00:18:56,845 --> 00:19:00,474
...and he propositioned her $1,000
to spend the night with him.

170
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:05,145
She kept bragging about how good
she was, so he upped the offer to $3,000...

171
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:06,730
...which she refused.

172
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:11,151
Then he offered me an additional $2,000
if l could convince her.

173
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:13,028
Which l did.

174
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:47,331
My girls are the best in the business.
The classiest.

175
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:50,876
What about the men, your customers?

176
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:54,630
They range from royalty to tycoons,
bank owners...

177
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:57,508
...to young, spoiled brats.

178
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:04,139
Unfortunately, four of my girls
have turned up dead...

179
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:08,227
...and that's not good for business.

180
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,979
Why didn't you call the police sooner?

181
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:13,899
l don't trust the cops. Not in my business.

182
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:17,653
But l heard about you,
the new girl in town.

183
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:22,741
l figured you're a lot like me.
Trying to survive in a man's world.

184
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:26,703
You? You won't fuck me.

185
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:31,458
l'll need to see a list of all your clients.

186
00:21:31,542 --> 00:21:34,628
Especially the ones
who may have been with all four girls.

187
00:21:34,837 --> 00:21:37,172
l can arrange that.
There were three of them...

188
00:21:37,256 --> 00:21:40,551
...and they were all referred to me
by Lilliana, a girl l let go.

189
00:21:40,843 --> 00:21:43,136
-Lilliana--
-She has her own business now.

190
00:21:43,846 --> 00:21:45,347
l'll give you her number.

191
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:48,851
That's as long as we reach
some sort of agreement.

192
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:51,186
Right.

193
00:21:51,687 --> 00:21:54,231
You're in the furniture business.

194
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:21,216
Lilliana?

195
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:23,802
You found me.

196
00:22:24,803 --> 00:22:27,306
Well, yeah, not without a little work.

197
00:22:30,225 --> 00:22:32,853
-You had questions about the murders?
-Yeah.

198
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:36,565
Do you know if any of your clients
slept with all four girls?

199
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:38,942
Three of them did.

200
00:22:39,568 --> 00:22:43,989
<i>Do you know which one might've been
with them on the nights they were killed?

201
00:22:44,573 --> 00:22:46,325
<i>It's impossible for me to say.

202
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:49,912
<i>I'm in the introduction business,
not the pandering business.

203
00:22:50,287 --> 00:22:52,873
l make my introductions, take my cuts...

204
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:56,043
...and my clients are free to call the girls
when they want to.

205
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:59,171
Who were these guys?

206
00:23:01,173 --> 00:23:04,551
Charles Denmore,
a real estate broker from Orange County.

207
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:08,305
Gerardo Orlando,
a horse owner from Temecula.

208
00:23:10,682 --> 00:23:12,142
And the third?

209
00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:16,688
Lilliana, this is an investigation
into a murder.

210
00:23:20,651 --> 00:23:21,985
His name is Blue.

211
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:26,323
Blue....

212
00:23:27,658 --> 00:23:31,662
<i>That's the name he goes by.
All the girls wanted to be with him.

213
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:33,497
And why is that?

214
00:23:33,664 --> 00:23:36,333
Because of the way he makes them feel.

215
00:23:38,836 --> 00:23:41,672
Do you think he would have slept
with all four girls?

216
00:23:42,256 --> 00:23:43,298
Yes.

217
00:23:43,382 --> 00:23:46,301
But Blue didn't kill them.
He's not capable of that.

218
00:23:46,969 --> 00:23:48,679
And what makes you so sure?

219
00:23:48,971 --> 00:23:52,140
Trust me, l know. He slept with me first...

220
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:55,811
...and l'm still alive
to talk about it, aren't l?

221
00:23:55,978 --> 00:24:01,316
Do you think any of your clients
have any kinky habits?

222
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:05,612
All men have kinky fantasies, darling.

223
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:08,824
But l don't recall
any of them involving murder.

224
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:10,284
What about drugs?

225
00:24:10,951 --> 00:24:12,953
Did anybody like to use ecstasy?

226
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:15,789
l can't speak for the other two gentlemen...

227
00:24:15,998 --> 00:24:20,043
...but Blue didn't need to use that.
He could love all by himself.

228
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:22,254
Can l meet him?

229
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:26,425
You won't be disappointed.

230
00:24:27,885 --> 00:24:28,802
Bad idea.

231
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:32,514
Well, somebody's got to get close enough
to get into his world.

232
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:35,058
Well, maybe it's a little too dangerous.

233
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:36,977
For what? For woman?

234
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:43,025
l was going to say, it might be better
if l do it since he's a sort of Valentino.

235
00:24:44,026 --> 00:24:47,237
You're worried about me? That's cute.

236
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:50,115
l'm worried about the case.

237
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,076
Maybe l misjudged you.

238
00:24:53,285 --> 00:24:55,120
You wouldn't be the first.

239
00:24:56,163 --> 00:24:58,290
Maybe your fiancée misjudged you, too.

240
00:25:00,626 --> 00:25:03,295
-A little too late for that, isn't it?
-Yeah.

241
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:10,594
Spit out the window.

242
00:25:51,385 --> 00:25:54,388
So, what's a babe like you
doing without a guy?

243
00:25:57,391 --> 00:25:58,600
Excuse me?

244
00:25:58,684 --> 00:26:01,103
Or are you one of those lipstick lesbos?

245
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:06,775
ls that real or are you just testing me?

246
00:26:07,276 --> 00:26:09,570
So, l'm right. You like chicks.

247
00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:16,618
Chicks. Yeah, l like chicks.

248
00:26:17,995 --> 00:26:22,124
FYl, you've always got
an open invitation, right here.

249
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:30,382
The day l become that desperate...

250
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:33,093
...that's the day l'll be a lesbian.

251
00:26:33,177 --> 00:26:35,095
Do you think l could watch?

252
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:37,264
You might hurt yourself.

253
00:26:42,853 --> 00:26:46,315
Charles Denmore,
real estate developer from Tustin...

254
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:49,359
...single-handedly put Laguna Niguel
on the map.

255
00:26:49,568 --> 00:26:51,904
Lives in Newport. Wife, no kids.

256
00:26:53,155 --> 00:26:57,659
Gildardo Orlando,
has a ranch in Temecula where he breeds...

257
00:26:57,868 --> 00:27:03,165
...world-class thoroughbreds.
Has a 3-year-old aptly named Call Girl.

258
00:27:03,457 --> 00:27:05,959
Won second place,
Kentucky Derby last year.

259
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:08,754
Rutherford Dresden.

260
00:27:08,921 --> 00:27:12,466
Ripe age of 40,
one of the richest men in the state.

261
00:27:12,591 --> 00:27:15,427
Just inherited several conglomerates
from Daddy.

262
00:27:15,511 --> 00:27:18,388
One being Antoinette Cosmetics.

263
00:27:18,889 --> 00:27:21,391
You want to know what they manufacture?

264
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:24,311
Lipstick: Bludgeon Rouge.

265
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:30,484
He's single, he lives in Pacific Palisades
and his friends call him "Blue."

266
00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:32,486
Good job, Rackles.

267
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,196
lt's a good start.

268
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:37,199
But we need to dig further
into all three of them.

269
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:38,700
So divide and conquer.

270
00:27:39,034 --> 00:27:40,494
l'll stay on Dresden.

271
00:27:40,661 --> 00:27:41,453
Fine.

272
00:27:41,537 --> 00:27:44,248
You two handle the others. Now beat it.

273
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:47,835
<i>-...tower. Good evening.
-Hello?

274
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,419
<i>Hello?

275
00:27:57,135 --> 00:27:59,680
<i>-...tower. Good evening.
-Hello?

276
00:28:09,565 --> 00:28:11,525
Metropolitan precinct.

277
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:15,362
Yeah. Hold on.

278
00:28:16,905 --> 00:28:19,157
Got a call for you. Line 1.

279
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:21,702
-McBain.
<i>-So I called him.

280
00:28:22,286 --> 00:28:23,370
Who?

281
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:26,415
<i>Blue. I told him I had a girl
he had to meet.

282
00:28:26,874 --> 00:28:27,666
When?

283
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:28,709
Midnight.

284
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:31,628
<i>-Tonight?
-You said you wanted to meet him.

285
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:33,672
<i>Hold on.

286
00:28:36,133 --> 00:28:38,552
-Where's Rackles?
-Poker game.

-Where's Captain Snyder?
-Poker game.

288
00:28:45,267 --> 00:28:46,393
Okay.

289
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:50,647
<i>-Where do I go?
-The Century Towers Hotel. Suite 2600.

290
00:28:51,607 --> 00:28:55,277
He's my best client,
so don't dress like a hooker.

291
00:28:55,652 --> 00:28:58,739
<i>Don't act like a cop,
unless he tries to kill you...

292
00:28:58,822 --> 00:29:00,574
<i>...which I doubt he'll do.

293
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:04,203
<i>He's going to sweep you off your feet,
darling.

294
00:29:04,286 --> 00:29:06,079
<i>I told him you were new...

295
00:29:06,288 --> 00:29:09,875
<i>...and you were one of the best girls
I'd seen in a long time.

296
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:12,628
<i>And I told him your name was Grace.

297
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:47,681
-Hi. l'm--
-Grace.

298
00:30:50,893 --> 00:30:53,729
Lilliana said l wouldn't be disappointed.

299
00:30:54,229 --> 00:30:57,274
-Are you?
-That remains to be seen.

300
00:30:58,442 --> 00:31:01,528
There's $5,000 in the envelope next to you.

301
00:31:06,575 --> 00:31:08,118
$5,000.

302
00:31:09,328 --> 00:31:11,496
That's what l was told.

303
00:31:25,636 --> 00:31:27,221
You are beautiful.

304
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,099
Thank you.

305
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:38,982
-Do you have anything to drink?
-Champagne?

306
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:41,026
Great.

307
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:00,462
Only one glass?

308
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,090
l don't drink.

309
00:32:04,967 --> 00:32:06,760
Well, l don't drink alone.

310
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:15,686
-Could you excuse me for one minute?
-Yes.

311
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:17,604
Make yourself at home.

312
00:32:35,706 --> 00:32:39,418
You know, l was thinking
that maybe we'd go see a show.

313
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:42,504
Great. l love shows.
l hear <i>Phantom is back.

314
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,884
Not that kind of show.

315
00:32:48,135 --> 00:32:49,678
What kind of show?

316
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:46,378
-What do you think?
-Not exactly what l had in mind.

317
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,411
Wait here.

318
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:37,758
-l had a great time tonight.
-Me, too.

319
00:37:39,718 --> 00:37:43,805
l think it would be a little more fun
to wait until another time.

320
00:37:45,015 --> 00:37:46,433
You're kidding.

321
00:37:47,893 --> 00:37:49,269
No.

322
00:37:50,854 --> 00:37:52,564
-Come on.
-Good night.

323
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:27,975
l got your message.
Been looking all over for you.

324
00:38:28,517 --> 00:38:31,645
What the hell are you thinking about,
seeing him alone?

325
00:38:31,728 --> 00:38:35,357
-Well, everybody else was playing cards.
-Then you don't go.

326
00:38:35,774 --> 00:38:39,486
lf he'd tried to kill you,
l wouldn't have been there to stop him.

327
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:42,030
l'm tired. Let's talk about this tomorrow.

328
00:38:42,114 --> 00:38:44,950
We're not talking tomorrow,
we're talking about it now.

329
00:38:45,033 --> 00:38:46,869
l'm your partner.

330
00:38:47,369 --> 00:38:50,789
Okay. He didn't kill me. Good night.

331
00:39:10,434 --> 00:39:12,978
l had no idea you owned the place.

332
00:39:13,061 --> 00:39:16,857
How do you think l find all my clients?
How do you think l found Blue?

333
00:39:17,983 --> 00:39:19,818
So, how was he?

334
00:39:22,905 --> 00:39:25,324
He was everything you said he'd be.

335
00:39:25,741 --> 00:39:28,327
l bet he wouldn't sleep with you,
would he?

336
00:39:28,911 --> 00:39:30,537
How did you know that?

337
00:39:30,704 --> 00:39:33,832
You're special.
You're something he's looking for.

338
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:36,960
l bet he's saving you.

339
00:39:37,044 --> 00:39:38,545
For what?

340
00:39:38,629 --> 00:39:41,715
lf he didn't sleep with you,
it means he likes you.

341
00:39:48,388 --> 00:39:50,307
So did he pay you?

342
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:52,518
Yeah.

343
00:39:56,813 --> 00:40:00,484
$5,000 and you didn't even have
to sleep with him.

344
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:05,280
lf you ever get tired of hassling people,
you can always come work for me.

345
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,578
My cut.

346
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:20,295
-l can't believe l'm actually doing this.
-That's what l used to say.

347
00:40:26,426 --> 00:40:30,305
That pill l swiped from his briefcase
turned out to be plain old aspirin.

348
00:40:30,389 --> 00:40:32,891
-No trace of ecstasy?
-No.

349
00:40:32,975 --> 00:40:36,436
Maybe you looked in the wrong place.
Maybe he laced the champagne.

350
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,814
-Did you get a sample of it?
-No.

351
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:42,609
Did you look in his room
for any black leather gloves?

352
00:40:42,693 --> 00:40:44,111
No.

353
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,196
Any lipstick?

354
00:40:47,281 --> 00:40:50,701
What about the other suspects?
What have we got going there?

355
00:40:51,285 --> 00:40:54,580
We're working on that.
They're both clean right now.

356
00:40:54,663 --> 00:40:57,207
And neither of them drive a Mercedes.

357
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,918
Am l missing something?

358
00:41:00,544 --> 00:41:03,755
Forensics found tyre tracks at the cliff site.

359
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:08,468
The tyre comes from a special edition,
a convertible Mercedes.

360
00:41:09,511 --> 00:41:13,640
So, l was wondering,
what kind of car does Blue drive?

361
00:41:14,433 --> 00:41:17,019
-We took a limo.
-How convenient.

362
00:41:18,896 --> 00:41:20,814
Yes, it was.

363
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:33,160
We just got a call from the San Pedro P.D.
Blue's mother died in 1972.

364
00:41:33,243 --> 00:41:35,162
-Do you want to know how?
-How?

365
00:41:35,245 --> 00:41:39,249
She jumped off the St. Thomas Bridge
and went splat on a passing barge.

366
00:41:42,878 --> 00:41:45,380
-She kind of favours you, McBain.
-Get out of here.

367
00:41:45,464 --> 00:41:46,798
Here's the weird part.

368
00:41:46,882 --> 00:41:50,385
When they pulled her body out,
she had on a fresh coat of red lipstick.

369
00:41:50,469 --> 00:41:52,804
Trainer, l want to see the full case file.

370
00:41:52,888 --> 00:41:57,726
See if Blue underwent any psychiatric
examinations after his mother's death.

371
00:41:57,893 --> 00:42:01,063
McBain, stay with him.
See where he leads.

372
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:36,491
Mr. Dresden's room is just down the hall.

373
00:43:38,702 --> 00:43:40,370
Thank you.

374
00:43:47,044 --> 00:43:50,464
By the way,
my manager told me to ask you:

375
00:43:50,547 --> 00:43:54,593
Will you be shooting anything?
l mean, the walls are kind of thin.

376
00:43:56,178 --> 00:43:59,515
lf l do, l'll use a silencer.

377
00:44:02,851 --> 00:44:04,144
Cool.

378
00:44:49,523 --> 00:44:52,067
-Hold it!
-Please don't kill me!

379
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:54,820
You can keep the money.
lt's in the envelope.

380
00:45:00,701 --> 00:45:02,202
-Where is he?
-He's late.

381
00:45:02,286 --> 00:45:06,290
He left me roses and a card
and told me to enjoy the room.

382
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:14,131
A man in a blue Porsche, did you see him?
Can l get my keys, please?

383
00:45:16,258 --> 00:45:17,926
Shit.

384
00:45:21,346 --> 00:45:23,223
Strange finding you here.

385
00:45:26,602 --> 00:45:28,979
Yeah, l know what you mean.

386
00:45:29,479 --> 00:45:31,190
l have a confession.

387
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:33,817
Look, l hardly know you.

388
00:45:33,901 --> 00:45:37,738
l was here to meet another girl,
but l backed out.

389
00:45:40,824 --> 00:45:42,201
Why?

390
00:45:43,911 --> 00:45:46,121
l couldn't stop thinking about you.

391
00:45:47,331 --> 00:45:49,208
-Really?
-Really.

392
00:45:55,547 --> 00:45:57,758
You want to go for a ride?

393
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:28,455
You didn't tell me
you lived in such a dump.

394
00:46:30,123 --> 00:46:31,458
Yeah, well.

395
00:46:31,542 --> 00:46:33,335
Do you live here alone?

396
00:46:33,418 --> 00:46:35,838
No, actually,
l live here with my housekeeper.

397
00:46:35,921 --> 00:46:39,675
-l could give you the grand tour.
-That would take about a week.

398
00:46:39,758 --> 00:46:42,261
l could stretch it out to two.

399
00:46:43,554 --> 00:46:46,181
So, do you bring
all your women back here?

400
00:46:48,016 --> 00:46:49,726
No.

401
00:46:51,311 --> 00:46:52,771
Why me?

402
00:46:55,023 --> 00:46:57,067
You're not like the other women.

403
00:50:29,154 --> 00:50:31,573
-Hi.
-l didn't wake you up, did l?

404
00:50:31,657 --> 00:50:34,159
No. l woke up on my own...

405
00:50:34,243 --> 00:50:38,121
...which is kind of funny
because it's your house...

406
00:50:38,205 --> 00:50:42,042
...and l probably should have been
the one to leave first.

407
00:50:43,043 --> 00:50:45,838
Yeah, well, l really couldn't sleep.

408
00:50:46,839 --> 00:50:49,883
Work usually helps.
l made some hot chocolate.

409
00:50:50,634 --> 00:50:53,220
-Did you want some?
-No, l'm fine. Thanks.

410
00:50:53,846 --> 00:50:55,597
ls that your mom?

411
00:50:56,223 --> 00:50:57,558
Yes.

412
00:50:57,641 --> 00:50:59,560
-She's beautiful.
-Thank you.

413
00:51:00,811 --> 00:51:03,272
Actually, you two could be sisters.

414
00:51:06,149 --> 00:51:07,901
Where is she now?

415
00:51:08,151 --> 00:51:10,112
She's dead.

416
00:51:10,779 --> 00:51:13,532
-l'm sorry.
-That's okay.

417
00:51:15,826 --> 00:51:18,245
She committed suicide when l was a kid.

418
00:51:19,246 --> 00:51:21,248
lt must have been hard on you.

419
00:51:21,456 --> 00:51:24,042
Then, it was a relief.

420
00:51:25,711 --> 00:51:27,880
She'd been cheating on my father.

421
00:51:30,048 --> 00:51:31,550
You knew about it?

422
00:51:31,633 --> 00:51:34,428
Oh, yeah. She used to take me with her.

423
00:51:35,554 --> 00:51:37,806
Actually, l was the one who told my father.

424
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:39,391
l'm sorry.

425
00:51:43,854 --> 00:51:47,149
l loved my mother
and l know she loved me...

426
00:51:47,357 --> 00:51:50,402
...but when she died,
we were on pretty bad terms.

427
00:51:53,238 --> 00:51:56,366
Anyway, this is for tonight.

428
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,788
About the money--

429
00:52:01,872 --> 00:52:05,459
No, l gotta keep this relationship
in perspective just for me.

430
00:52:06,084 --> 00:52:07,377
Okay.

431
00:52:08,462 --> 00:52:10,380
l'll be downstairs.

432
00:52:10,464 --> 00:52:14,092
You get dressed
and l'll give you a ride back to your car.

433
00:53:08,522 --> 00:53:10,524
Shit, Rackles!

434
00:53:12,276 --> 00:53:13,694
Drama club.

435
00:53:13,777 --> 00:53:15,779
Tell me, do you still know how to act...

436
00:53:15,863 --> 00:53:19,366
...or do you find it hard
to separate your work from reality?

437
00:53:19,992 --> 00:53:22,494
What the hell are you doing in my house?

438
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:24,288
lt's cold outside.

439
00:53:24,371 --> 00:53:25,998
So, what, you just broke in?

440
00:53:26,081 --> 00:53:28,041
Hell, no, l'd never do that.

441
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:31,170
Go home, Rackles.
lsn't it past your bedtime?

442
00:53:37,301 --> 00:53:39,761
McBain, l'm worried about you.

443
00:53:39,887 --> 00:53:42,556
Clearly, Blue finds you sexy.

444
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:45,684
l just don't want to find you "dead" sexy.

445
00:53:46,143 --> 00:53:48,145
He hasn't been proven a killer.

446
00:53:48,228 --> 00:53:50,564
Oh, really? Well, what about his mother?

447
00:53:50,647 --> 00:53:53,317
You think that was just a coincidence.

448
00:53:54,943 --> 00:53:58,530
You know, you may find this hard
to believe, but he loved his mother.

449
00:53:58,614 --> 00:54:02,159
He doesn't love anyone.
That's why he sleeps with whores.

450
00:54:02,492 --> 00:54:04,786
-l'm not a whore.
-l didn't say you were.

451
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:07,915
-Fuck off, Rackles.
-You slept with him, didn't you?

452
00:54:09,208 --> 00:54:11,001
Get out of here!

453
00:54:11,084 --> 00:54:14,296
l swear to God,
l'm going to call the Captain right now.

454
00:54:15,088 --> 00:54:18,175
l'm sure he'll be happy to hear from us
at 2:00 in the morning.

455
00:54:18,258 --> 00:54:22,137
You only pressed six numbers,
but you can hang it up. l'm leaving.

456
00:54:23,555 --> 00:54:27,726
Look, if there's anybody that has a problem
differentiating reality...

457
00:54:27,809 --> 00:54:30,062
...and work, it is you.

458
00:54:30,437 --> 00:54:33,315
Have you got some personal vendetta?
What is it?

459
00:54:33,607 --> 00:54:37,319
Well, Charles Denmore, Gildardo Orlando...

460
00:54:37,402 --> 00:54:39,696
...they're all squeaky clean, McBain.

461
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:44,076
The tyre tracks don't match.
So, Blue? He's our only suspect.

462
00:54:44,409 --> 00:54:46,286
Then get another one.

463
00:55:01,802 --> 00:55:06,265
Did you check his tyres?
Maybe he put custom tyres on his car.

464
00:55:08,183 --> 00:55:10,018
Good night!

465
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:42,926
<i>I just got the case file
on the mother's suicide.

466
00:55:44,011 --> 00:55:47,097
They weren't able to do an autopsy.
The father had the body cremated.

467
00:55:47,306 --> 00:55:51,101
The coroner's report mentions
that she had a broken neck.

468
00:55:51,185 --> 00:55:54,563
They assumed that was caused
by her collision with the barge.

469
00:55:54,646 --> 00:55:57,232
But take a look at these marks.

470
00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:01,695
These marks look just like the ones
we found on the other dead girls.

471
00:56:01,778 --> 00:56:04,990
l talked to the cop who found her body.
He's retired now.

472
00:56:05,073 --> 00:56:07,284
He doesn't think she jumped.

473
00:56:07,367 --> 00:56:08,785
Why's that?

474
00:56:08,869 --> 00:56:12,414
She left her car on the bridge,
but they never found her keys...

475
00:56:12,497 --> 00:56:14,708
...not on her body, not in the car.

476
00:56:14,917 --> 00:56:17,294
So they fell in the water. So what?

477
00:56:17,377 --> 00:56:19,922
Blue was missing
when they found her body.

478
00:56:20,005 --> 00:56:23,383
When they picked him up,
he had her keys in his pocket.

479
00:56:27,596 --> 00:56:30,641
How did the San Pedro P.D.
get involved in all this?

480
00:56:30,807 --> 00:56:32,559
l told you. They called me.

481
00:56:32,643 --> 00:56:36,730
-l mean, how did they know about it?
-l don't know. Maybe from your memo?

482
00:56:36,813 --> 00:56:39,775
Do we have anything
on that psychiatric evaluation yet?

483
00:56:39,858 --> 00:56:41,318
l put a call in to the DA.

484
00:56:41,401 --> 00:56:45,322
lf the state required him to see a shrink
after his momma went bye-bye...

485
00:56:45,405 --> 00:56:47,115
...they'd have a record of it.

486
00:56:47,199 --> 00:56:49,785
Good. Keep me posted.

487
00:56:57,292 --> 00:56:59,211
How well do you know Billy Trainer?

488
00:56:59,294 --> 00:57:01,672
Don't tell me you want to do him, too.

489
00:57:02,548 --> 00:57:04,633
l never mentioned Blue in my memo.

490
00:57:04,716 --> 00:57:06,969
So maybe he did a little homework himself.

491
00:57:07,052 --> 00:57:10,681
You're not the only one here
who wants to make a good impression.

492
00:57:10,764 --> 00:57:13,225
You said he was from
a wealthy background, right?

493
00:57:13,308 --> 00:57:15,435
Do you think he knows Blue?

494
00:57:16,937 --> 00:57:19,398
l told you, it's an 18th century Newport.

495
00:57:19,481 --> 00:57:22,192
l can't let it go for anything less than $250.

496
00:57:24,027 --> 00:57:27,823
Listen, l'm going to have to call you back.
All right? 'Bye.

497
00:57:39,334 --> 00:57:42,421
Were you talking about a girl
or a piece of furniture?

498
00:57:42,504 --> 00:57:44,381
What's the difference?

499
00:57:44,923 --> 00:57:47,843
Well, have you ever tried to hump
a piece of furniture?

500
00:57:47,926 --> 00:57:50,929
Yeah, my first husband.
Gave me splinters.

501
00:57:53,056 --> 00:57:55,225
l haven't seen you in a long time.

502
00:57:56,101 --> 00:57:57,936
So how are you doing?

503
00:57:58,520 --> 00:57:59,897
Better.

504
00:58:00,898 --> 00:58:03,192
Why do you still keep a picture
of her here?

505
00:58:03,275 --> 00:58:06,528
Because she was beautiful.
What are you doing here?

506
00:58:07,196 --> 00:58:10,073
l can't imagine you're here to reminisce.

507
00:58:10,574 --> 00:58:14,203
Actually, l need to talk to one of your girls.

508
00:58:16,455 --> 00:58:20,000
Do you have one in mind,
or do you want me to pick?

509
00:58:22,669 --> 00:58:24,463
<i>-...tower. Good evening.
-Hello?

510
00:58:24,755 --> 00:58:25,756
<i>Hello?

511
00:58:28,759 --> 00:58:29,843
<i>Hello?

512
00:58:32,221 --> 00:58:34,097
-Hey.
-Hey, how are you doing?

513
00:58:34,223 --> 00:58:36,141
Good. What you got?

514
00:58:36,225 --> 00:58:38,894
l've cleaned it
and even digitally enhanced it...

515
00:58:38,977 --> 00:58:41,355
...but l'm still not sure
where it comes from.

516
00:58:41,438 --> 00:58:43,023
There is one thing, though.

517
00:58:43,106 --> 00:58:47,778
The word "evening" gets stretched
right after the first click. Listen.

518
00:58:48,946 --> 00:58:50,781
<i>-...tower. Good evening.
-Hello?

519
00:58:50,864 --> 00:58:52,074
<i>Hello?

520
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:55,702
My VCR does that when l press "Pause."

521
00:58:55,869 --> 00:58:57,037
Exactly.

522
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:00,249
Whoever left the message
was playing a videotape on their VCR.

523
00:59:00,332 --> 00:59:02,668
Maybe we can find out
what was on the tape.

524
00:59:02,751 --> 00:59:05,170
Good possibility. Let me check it out.

525
00:59:15,889 --> 00:59:19,184
McBain, you've got a phone call. Line 2.

526
00:59:19,518 --> 00:59:22,688
Thanks. Can we get somebody
to make some fresh coffee?

527
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:29,486
-McBain.
<i>-Kate, this is Lilliana.

528
00:59:30,529 --> 00:59:31,780
Hi. What's up?

529
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:33,240
<i>Blue called.

530
00:59:34,408 --> 00:59:36,910
He told me to tell you
he can't see you anymore.

531
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:40,581
Why didn't he call me himself?

532
00:59:42,165 --> 00:59:44,001
He didn't want to hurt you.

533
00:59:44,126 --> 00:59:48,338
<i>-Was he planning on hurting me?
-He didn't mean for things to go that far.

534
00:59:48,547 --> 00:59:50,465
He wants them to stop before they do.

535
00:59:51,925 --> 00:59:54,761
Well, l guess he finally came around then?

536
00:59:55,304 --> 00:59:57,890
<i>He'd only hurt you anyway, darling.

537
01:00:43,685 --> 01:00:45,854
l was wondering when you'd show up.

538
01:00:46,563 --> 01:00:50,317
You could have talked to me in person.
l can take rejection.

539
01:00:52,778 --> 01:00:56,823
l was in meetings all day,
and Lilliana volunteered to call you.

540
01:00:58,075 --> 01:00:59,826
That's not what she said.

541
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:03,080
Well, that's Lilliana.

542
01:01:06,083 --> 01:01:09,586
Why didn't you take the money
l left for you the other night?

543
01:01:10,087 --> 01:01:11,338
You know why.

544
01:01:14,341 --> 01:01:16,176
Made you feel like a whore?

545
01:01:17,302 --> 01:01:19,763
No. Made me feel.

546
01:01:23,642 --> 01:01:26,603
-Now, Grace, l can't do this.
-Do what?

547
01:01:26,687 --> 01:01:31,483
A relationship. l haven't had one
in a long time and l'm not about to start.

548
01:01:38,282 --> 01:01:40,534
l thought you said you didn't drink.

549
01:01:40,617 --> 01:01:41,869
l didn't...

550
01:01:43,412 --> 01:01:45,205
...until l met you.

551
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:16,403
They're all hookers.

552
01:02:17,154 --> 01:02:21,617
l slept with every one of them.
Now they're all dead.

553
01:02:24,536 --> 01:02:26,079
l got to stop seeing you, Grace.

554
01:02:26,163 --> 01:02:28,999
l don't want the same thing
to happen to you.

555
01:02:29,583 --> 01:02:33,003
lt couldn't, could it?
You didn't kill them, did you?

556
01:02:33,086 --> 01:02:35,255
Of course l didn't.

557
01:02:36,089 --> 01:02:41,345
After all the loss l've suffered in my life,
do you honestly think l could kill someone?

558
01:02:47,434 --> 01:02:51,188
-Why didn't you just go to the police?
-l did go to the police.

559
01:02:52,064 --> 01:02:54,733
Right after the first two girls
got murdered.

560
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:59,238
l thought it was a strange coincidence.
l didn't want them to think l was involved.

561
01:02:59,321 --> 01:03:02,866
l told them everything
about my relationship with the girls.

562
01:03:12,167 --> 01:03:14,628
The same thing happened with my mother.

563
01:03:15,838 --> 01:03:17,339
What do you mean?

564
01:03:17,548 --> 01:03:20,592
The cops,
they asked me all kinds of questions.

565
01:03:22,094 --> 01:03:26,348
They asked me
if l pushed my mother off the bridge.

566
01:03:30,102 --> 01:03:34,064
l was 13 years old.
She was everything to me.

567
01:03:47,244 --> 01:03:49,955
l thought because the suicides
were similar...

568
01:03:50,163 --> 01:03:53,625
...that they might think
that l had something to do with it.

569
01:04:51,642 --> 01:04:53,352
Good morning.

570
01:04:54,144 --> 01:04:57,022
Good morning. Didn't you sleep late.

571
01:04:57,606 --> 01:05:00,776
-lt's 6:30.
-Yes, but l get up at 5:00.

572
01:05:02,361 --> 01:05:03,862
"l get up at 5:00."

573
01:05:05,989 --> 01:05:08,867
-Do you want some cereal?
-Yes, l do. Thank you.

574
01:05:09,159 --> 01:05:11,328
<i>I'm Lynn Hightower. Good evening.

575
01:05:11,411 --> 01:05:13,705
<i>Updating our earlier story, about the boy...

576
01:05:13,789 --> 01:05:16,041
<i>...lost in the San Bernardino Mountains--

577
01:05:16,124 --> 01:05:18,502
Doesn't Lynn Hightower
anchor the evening news?

578
01:05:18,585 --> 01:05:20,128
When l go out at night...

579
01:05:20,212 --> 01:05:23,507
...l like to tape the news
so l can watch it in the morning.

580
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:26,134
<i>The discovery was made today
by a couple of hikers...

581
01:05:26,218 --> 01:05:28,887
<i>...who were hiking
in the nearby mountains.

582
01:05:29,555 --> 01:05:32,641
<i>I'm Lynn Hightower. Good evening.

583
01:05:36,478 --> 01:05:39,398
We'll get back with you
as soon as we know something.

584
01:05:39,481 --> 01:05:41,316
Okay, great. Thanks. 'Bye.

585
01:05:42,401 --> 01:05:43,652
Where is everybody?

586
01:05:43,735 --> 01:05:47,281
They're interrogating a hooker
who claims Blue killed those other girls.

587
01:05:47,364 --> 01:05:49,241
Rackles was right about him.

588
01:05:49,324 --> 01:05:50,826
So, how long did Georgia know Blue?

589
01:05:52,035 --> 01:05:55,497
Georgia had been with Blue several times.
Finally, she came to me.

590
01:05:55,581 --> 01:05:58,041
She was worried.
He'd wanted her to take ecstasy.

591
01:05:58,125 --> 01:06:00,252
She was afraid, because she knew...

592
01:06:00,335 --> 01:06:03,088
...Robin and Dee took ecstasy
the nights they were killed.

593
01:06:03,172 --> 01:06:06,508
lf you knew these things,
if you knew that he might be the killer...

594
01:06:06,592 --> 01:06:09,761
...then why'd you go
to the Century Towers Hotel to meet him?

595
01:06:09,845 --> 01:06:11,430
l didn't know it was him.

596
01:06:11,513 --> 01:06:13,932
Not until l got to the room
and l saw his note.

597
01:06:14,016 --> 01:06:17,019
Patty told me l was seeing
a man named Rutherford Dresden.

598
01:06:17,102 --> 01:06:20,147
Well, didn't you know
that Rutherford Dresden is Blue?

599
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:21,273
l do now!

600
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,609
Bullshit. Who's been talking to you?

601
01:06:23,692 --> 01:06:27,029
Nobody. l knew he wouldn't try
to hurt me because...

602
01:06:27,571 --> 01:06:29,489
...l heard he loves blondes.

603
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:32,367
Hell, he'd probably go nuts over you.

604
01:06:48,133 --> 01:06:51,512
Did you know one of your girls
came into the station this morning...

605
01:06:51,595 --> 01:06:55,682
...and in a sworn statement
told me Blue killed those other women?

606
01:06:56,016 --> 01:06:58,060
You must be referring to Carla.

607
01:06:58,519 --> 01:07:01,563
That's right.
Does she have any reason to frame Blue?

608
01:07:01,855 --> 01:07:05,359
l don't think Carla even knows Blue.
She's not his type.

609
01:07:06,527 --> 01:07:07,736
Really?

610
01:07:20,123 --> 01:07:22,918
Carla told me Georgia Gaines
was afraid of Blue.

611
01:07:23,335 --> 01:07:25,003
Where did she hear that from?

612
01:07:25,087 --> 01:07:27,840
From Georgia, the night before she died.

613
01:07:28,632 --> 01:07:32,177
-They were friends.
-Friends? l doubt it.

614
01:07:34,054 --> 01:07:35,514
Why would she lie?

615
01:07:36,682 --> 01:07:40,018
How would l know?
l'm their agent, not their shrink.

616
01:07:43,647 --> 01:07:45,357
Had any visitors lately?

617
01:07:47,025 --> 01:07:49,027
Just an old customer.

618
01:07:54,783 --> 01:07:56,201
What did he want?

619
01:07:57,661 --> 01:07:59,079
To see one of my girls.

620
01:09:42,349 --> 01:09:44,142
When you worked for Pat...

621
01:09:44,226 --> 01:09:46,812
...did you ever come across
a client named Rackles?

622
01:09:46,895 --> 01:09:49,439
Yes, l remember him. He was a detective.

623
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:51,817
Did he know Blue?

624
01:09:52,776 --> 01:09:55,487
-They have a history.
-What kind of history?

625
01:09:56,446 --> 01:09:57,656
Robin Stone.

626
01:09:58,073 --> 01:10:00,659
-The first girl that died.
-What about her?

627
01:10:14,006 --> 01:10:15,841
She was engaged to Rackles.

628
01:10:16,425 --> 01:10:19,511
When Rackles found out
Blue was sleeping with her...

629
01:10:19,887 --> 01:10:22,723
...he threatened Blue.
He had to be restrained.

630
01:10:24,975 --> 01:10:26,685
Robin died a week later.

631
01:12:09,162 --> 01:12:12,749
"Back off, bitch?" ls that supposed
to throw me off your trail?

632
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:14,835
What are you talking about?

633
01:12:14,918 --> 01:12:18,338
You hid a statement from Blue
in your filing cabinet.

634
01:12:18,422 --> 01:12:21,633
l'm talking about how you asked Carla
to lie about him.

635
01:12:22,259 --> 01:12:24,178
Where did you hear that one?

636
01:12:25,053 --> 01:12:28,849
You're just doing your damnedest
to try and set him up, aren't you?

637
01:12:30,934 --> 01:12:33,478
You don't know what you're talking about.

638
01:12:34,813 --> 01:12:37,065
l know Robin Stone was your fiancée.

639
01:12:41,486 --> 01:12:44,114
When you found out
she was screwing around with Blue...

640
01:12:44,198 --> 01:12:46,700
...she turned up dead
and you tried to pin it on him.

641
01:12:46,783 --> 01:12:48,493
You even threatened him.

642
01:12:49,161 --> 01:12:51,079
l see you've been talking to Lilliana.

643
01:12:51,163 --> 01:12:55,000
Did she also tell you that he filed
a restraining order against me?

644
01:12:55,459 --> 01:12:57,461
l never even went near him.

645
01:12:57,544 --> 01:12:59,421
Why didn't you tell me about Robin?

646
01:12:59,505 --> 01:13:02,007
-lt wasn't relevant.
-lt's a conflict of interest.

647
01:13:02,090 --> 01:13:04,259
Maybe l have trouble sleeping at night.

648
01:13:04,343 --> 01:13:07,179
Maybe l have other reasons
why l want the case to end...

649
01:13:07,262 --> 01:13:08,972
...but l haven't framed anybody.

650
01:13:09,056 --> 01:13:11,266
Why did you call Pat to find Carla?

651
01:13:11,642 --> 01:13:14,144
Carla called me. She left Pat's number.

652
01:13:14,228 --> 01:13:17,814
How else do you think we brought her
in here for her statement?

653
01:13:17,981 --> 01:13:22,528
l haven't told anyone to lie,
and l disregard a half-assed statement...

654
01:13:22,611 --> 01:13:25,864
...because l believe he came in here
to cover his sorry ass.

655
01:13:25,948 --> 01:13:28,617
Just like he filed
that restraining order against me.

656
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:32,204
-That's crap.
-He's a liar. He's a lowlife liar.

657
01:13:32,287 --> 01:13:35,707
He's manipulating Lilliana
just like he manipulated all those girls.

658
01:13:35,791 --> 01:13:37,251
Now, he's manipulating you.

659
01:13:37,334 --> 01:13:39,253
-You don't know--
-You're falling for him.

660
01:13:39,336 --> 01:13:41,421
Just like that suspect up North.

661
01:13:41,505 --> 01:13:43,465
You can't keep your pants on.

662
01:13:43,715 --> 01:13:45,092
Fuck you.

663
01:13:54,142 --> 01:13:55,936
He's withholding evidence.

664
01:13:56,019 --> 01:13:57,896
Maybe he's putting together a case.

665
01:13:57,980 --> 01:13:59,857
Well, then he should have told me!

666
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:02,025
So he didn't tell you. So what?

667
01:14:02,109 --> 01:14:04,319
He asked a witness to commit perjury.

668
01:14:04,403 --> 01:14:06,113
So call Kenneth Starr.

669
01:14:08,198 --> 01:14:10,200
Do you have any proof of that?

670
01:14:10,701 --> 01:14:13,787
l'll get it.
You get Carla in here and l will get it.

671
01:14:16,498 --> 01:14:20,961
Why don't you sit this one out, Detective,
before you get transferred again?

672
01:14:24,715 --> 01:14:26,091
Captain Snyder.

673
01:14:27,718 --> 01:14:29,052
We'll be right out.

674
01:14:30,137 --> 01:14:33,932
l just received a copy of Dr. Strober's
psychiatric evaluation of Blue...

675
01:14:34,057 --> 01:14:37,561
...after his mother's death.
ln a nutshell, it states...

676
01:14:37,895 --> 01:14:41,356
...that Blue was sexually molested
by his mother countless times...

677
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,567
...between the ages of 10 and 13.

678
01:14:43,650 --> 01:14:46,570
Did the doctor suspect
Blue killed his mother?

679
01:14:46,653 --> 01:14:50,574
Not according to his notes.
But l did some checking and discovered...

680
01:14:50,657 --> 01:14:53,911
...Dr. Strober is an old school buddy
of Blue's father.

681
01:14:54,286 --> 01:14:56,914
You're suggesting the father
asked him to lie?

682
01:14:57,664 --> 01:15:00,375
No, l'm saying that Blue's father...

683
01:15:00,501 --> 01:15:03,212
...paid Dr. Strober to say...

684
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:06,340
...that Blue was incapable
of murdering his mother.

685
01:15:06,924 --> 01:15:09,593
l hope that helps you sleep better at night.

686
01:15:13,388 --> 01:15:16,850
Six months after the case was closed,
an apparent suicide...

687
01:15:18,018 --> 01:15:22,272
...our good Dr. Strober moved
from a two-bedroom in Encino...

688
01:15:22,356 --> 01:15:24,566
...to a six-bedroom in Bel Air.

689
01:15:28,862 --> 01:15:32,407
lf Blue is the killer, seeing this woman
may have been a trigger for him.

690
01:15:32,491 --> 01:15:34,326
Because she looks so like his mother...

691
01:15:34,409 --> 01:15:37,579
...it brought back all these feelings
of lust and rage.

692
01:15:37,996 --> 01:15:40,666
So he went out to re-enact
his childhood trauma...

693
01:15:40,749 --> 01:15:42,668
...on other, more accessible women...

694
01:15:42,751 --> 01:15:44,795
...who resembled his mother.

695
01:15:45,754 --> 01:15:48,507
And to make it even more real...

696
01:15:48,632 --> 01:15:51,552
...he asked them to wear
his mother's lipstick:

697
01:15:52,177 --> 01:15:54,304
Burgeon Rouge.

698
01:15:55,222 --> 01:15:59,226
Detective McBain looks more like
his mother than any of these women do.

699
01:15:59,726 --> 01:16:01,645
Why didn't he kill her?

700
01:16:01,728 --> 01:16:04,773
Maybe they're so much alike
he wants to reverse the pattern.

701
01:16:04,857 --> 01:16:07,150
ln order to undo what he already did.

702
01:16:07,901 --> 01:16:12,573
Remember, he's struggling
with two very powerful emotions:

703
01:16:12,906 --> 01:16:16,702
Rage and lust. He's highly volatile.

704
01:16:17,077 --> 01:16:19,580
Who knows which one
will ultimately triumph.

705
01:16:26,587 --> 01:16:27,963
Good morning.

706
01:16:29,715 --> 01:16:31,758
You keep late hours, Detective.

707
01:16:34,219 --> 01:16:35,804
How did you find out?

708
01:16:37,472 --> 01:16:40,767
lt seems somebody sent me this article.
Very interesting.

709
01:16:44,938 --> 01:16:46,481
Who gave you that?

710
01:16:46,565 --> 01:16:49,193
l don't know.
There wasn't a return address.

711
01:16:50,861 --> 01:16:54,865
lt seems that you have a habit
of sleeping with men you're investigating.

712
01:16:54,948 --> 01:16:56,783
lt's a bad habit for a cop.

713
01:17:00,370 --> 01:17:03,874
You know, if l were you,
l'd take a good look at your partner.

714
01:17:04,917 --> 01:17:08,921
You know he's had a hard-on for me
ever since Robin Stone got murdered.

715
01:17:10,464 --> 01:17:13,133
lf you ask me, he's the one that killed her.

716
01:17:14,468 --> 01:17:17,179
She found out how he was getting
the money to pay her.

717
01:17:17,262 --> 01:17:19,223
How was he getting the money?

718
01:17:19,306 --> 01:17:22,809
Police impound.
He was stealing confiscated drug money.

719
01:17:34,905 --> 01:17:37,366
Check it out. This is for you.

720
01:17:40,786 --> 01:17:43,956
lf you want to see me later,
you know where to find me.

721
01:17:44,498 --> 01:17:45,541
'Bye.

722
01:18:27,666 --> 01:18:30,210
-Hi, Anton.
-Hi. lt's on the house.

723
01:18:30,544 --> 01:18:31,962
Have you seen Blue?

724
01:18:32,045 --> 01:18:34,715
Not yet.
But l will personally send him over.

725
01:18:36,216 --> 01:18:38,010
How about Lilliana? ls she around?

726
01:18:38,093 --> 01:18:40,721
Not tonight. Tonight she has a date.

727
01:18:42,556 --> 01:18:44,474
l thought she didn't do that anymore.

728
01:18:44,558 --> 01:18:47,436
She does that for $5,000.

729
01:18:48,604 --> 01:18:51,398
Anton. Century Towers Hotel?

730
01:18:51,899 --> 01:18:53,400
How did you know?

731
01:19:12,294 --> 01:19:14,129
Yeah. Detective McBain.

732
01:19:14,213 --> 01:19:17,090
l got an attempted homicide
at the Century Towers Hotel.

733
01:19:17,174 --> 01:19:18,759
l need backup immediately.

734
01:20:27,703 --> 01:20:29,580
-Did you see his Mercedes?
-Yeah.

735
01:20:29,663 --> 01:20:32,416
-She checked into room 2600.
-What are you doing here?

736
01:20:32,499 --> 01:20:35,127
l heard the call on my radio.
l was only a block away.

737
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:38,922
-All right, watch the front. l'm going up.
-Sure you want to go up alone?

738
01:20:39,006 --> 01:20:41,091
Okay, whatever. Take the stairs.

739
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:40,567
Stop!

740
01:21:50,911 --> 01:21:53,580
He's probably on the roof. l met him here.

741
01:22:14,309 --> 01:22:16,728
Stay here. Cover the stairs, all right?

742
01:22:59,438 --> 01:23:00,731
Drop it!

743
01:23:01,148 --> 01:23:02,232
Kate.

744
01:23:02,816 --> 01:23:04,193
Put the gun down!

745
01:23:04,276 --> 01:23:06,570
Why?
Do you think l'm trying to shoot you?

746
01:23:06,653 --> 01:23:08,780
Put the goddamn gun down!

747
01:23:09,114 --> 01:23:10,908
Kate, someone killed Lilliana.

748
01:23:10,991 --> 01:23:13,243
Put the fucking gun down!

749
01:23:13,327 --> 01:23:16,163
He's up here.
lt's the only place he could go.

750
01:23:16,622 --> 01:23:17,915
Drop it, Rack!

751
01:23:54,451 --> 01:23:56,870
Forensics found a used lipstick
in his pocket...

752
01:23:56,954 --> 01:23:58,747
...and her perfume on his clothes.

753
01:23:58,830 --> 01:24:01,041
The guy from lnternal Affairs told me...

754
01:24:01,124 --> 01:24:05,212
...they'd been investigating Rackles
for keeping confiscated drug money.

755
01:24:05,462 --> 01:24:09,883
Apparently, he had a safety deposit box
with $40,000 stashed in it.

756
01:24:10,217 --> 01:24:15,180
Billy found a box of clasped envelopes and
a video of the newscaster in his Porsche.

757
01:24:16,139 --> 01:24:19,101
He'd been framing Blue for months.
No denying it.

758
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:24,022
Too bad he won't be around
to defend himself.

759
01:24:24,731 --> 01:24:27,359
Guess l owe you an apology, Detective.

760
01:24:27,818 --> 01:24:29,611
You're right about Blue.

761
01:24:30,028 --> 01:24:33,866
Who knows, you may even have been right
about that guy up North, too.

762
01:24:45,169 --> 01:24:47,045
Where's McBain, do you know?

763
01:24:47,129 --> 01:24:49,006
She went home early.

764
01:24:50,090 --> 01:24:53,177
l wanted her to see the coroner's report
on Detective Rackles.

765
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:56,096
-l'll take it for her.
-All right.

766
01:25:00,809 --> 01:25:02,394
You know, it's weird.

767
01:25:03,187 --> 01:25:06,982
We ran a DNA test on hair we found
in that dead girl's hotel room.

768
01:25:09,735 --> 01:25:11,904
lt didn't match Rackles'.

769
01:25:14,364 --> 01:25:16,074
lt was somebody else's.

770
01:25:17,159 --> 01:25:18,869
Who did it belong to?

771
01:25:20,787 --> 01:25:24,666
Somebody who liked to swim. l found
traces of chlorine on the hair sample.

772
01:26:10,921 --> 01:26:12,631
You scared me.

773
01:26:14,258 --> 01:26:16,176
How you doing, good-looking?

774
01:26:17,386 --> 01:26:19,179
l heard about Lilliana.

775
01:26:19,263 --> 01:26:21,682
All over the news. You okay?

776
01:26:23,767 --> 01:26:27,354
Yeah, l'm fine. Coming in?

777
01:26:31,024 --> 01:26:34,653
He always wanted my life,
even before Robin Stone.

778
01:26:34,820 --> 01:26:38,532
He tried to shake us down for money
or he was going to close down Lilliana.

779
01:26:38,615 --> 01:26:42,160
Then we introduced him to Robin Stone
and he shut the hell up.

780
01:26:44,621 --> 01:26:46,415
Well, he can't have your life now.

781
01:26:46,498 --> 01:26:49,543
Yeah. That would be a neat trick.

782
01:26:52,462 --> 01:26:54,173
l'm so glad it wasn't you.

783
01:26:54,256 --> 01:26:58,343
Yeah, me too. l'd look horrible
in prison orange, wouldn't l?

784
01:27:06,685 --> 01:27:08,103
Come on.

785
