00:00:01,376 --> 00:00:04,209
(MultiCom Jingle)

2
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,150
(waves crashing)

3
00:00:25,112 --> 00:00:27,612
(eerie music)

4
00:02:05,197 --> 00:02:07,780
(cars driving)

5
00:02:33,975 --> 00:02:36,808
(phone vibrating)

6
00:02:45,894 --> 00:02:47,275
- [Brandon] Hey what's up man?

7
00:02:47,275 --> 00:02:49,798
- It's over with Dana.

8
00:02:49,798 --> 00:02:51,513
- [Brandon] Really?

9
00:02:51,513 --> 00:02:52,430
You sure?

10
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,910
- Pretty sure.

11
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,640
I went through her search history

12
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,850
and she basically was on
this dude name Logan's

13
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,940
Facebook page like 300 times.

14
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,890
So I'm thinking it's a bad sign.

15
00:03:07,193 --> 00:03:09,360
(buzzing)

16
00:03:11,638 --> 00:03:12,750
- [Dana] That's it spy on me?

17
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,480
You break into my computer?

18
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,020
- [Brandon] So where are you gonna go?

19
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,853
- I don't know.

20
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,308
- [Brandon] Well I'm headed to

21
00:03:20,308 --> 00:03:22,108
my folks' place for the weekend but,

22
00:03:24,373 --> 00:03:26,350
maybe you can come with me if you want.

23
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,010
- [Dana] You don't talk you little shit.

24
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,320
- To your folks?

25
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,153
- Yeah.

26
00:03:30,153 --> 00:03:31,750
Get out of town, clear your head.

27
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,400
- [Dana] Did you hack into my phone?

28
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,220
- I don't wanna impose or anything.

29
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,360
- No, you wouldn't be imposing.

30
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,608
Honestly it's a long drive
and I could use the company.

31
00:03:41,608 --> 00:03:42,605
It'll be fun.

32
00:03:42,605 --> 00:03:43,644
You know?

33
00:03:43,644 --> 00:03:45,104
You can get to see where I grew up.

34
00:03:45,104 --> 00:03:46,205
(laughing)

35
00:03:46,205 --> 00:03:50,104
Getting a home-cooked meal,
come on, what do you say?

36
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,854
(glass breaking)

37
00:03:54,307 --> 00:03:55,405
- [Dana] If you're gonna give me nothing

38
00:03:55,405 --> 00:03:57,446
I'd rather have the space.

39
00:03:57,446 --> 00:04:00,227
(door slamming)

40
00:04:00,227 --> 00:04:02,727
(eerie music)

41
00:05:21,658 --> 00:05:24,075
(soft music)

42
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,490
- You still drawing cartoons?

43
00:05:29,935 --> 00:05:31,570
- It's a graphic novel.

44
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,670
- I didn't mean that as an insult.

45
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,170
- Whatever, I'm pretty
much in this all to myself.

46
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,560
- You gotta keep a positive attitude man.

47
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,870
I heard this story on NPR where
they took a set of lab rats,

48
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,876
and half of them they wrote a sign that

49
00:05:46,876 --> 00:05:49,180
said dumb over'um, the
other half said smart.

50
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,150
The rats with the smart sign made it

51
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,700
through the maze twice as fast.

52
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,250
Just stay open to positive man.

53
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,660
Don't limit yourself with negative labels.

54
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,530
It's not helpful.

55
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,999
Wanna get high?

56
00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:09,997
- Yes.

57
00:06:09,997 --> 00:06:12,747
(relaxing music)

58
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:22,763
- Keep.

59
00:06:24,294 --> 00:06:27,044
(relaxing music)

60
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,163
Keep.

61
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,009
Oh.

62
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:33,842
(laughing)

63
00:06:33,842 --> 00:06:34,675
Keep.

64
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,003
Keep.

65
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,340
Oh, this was Brandon's favorite.

66
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,060
He used to dig holes in the yard

67
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,190
and try to stuff him down there.

68
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:53,190
In his little voice he'd say,
go on Hoppy you're free now.

69
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,520
And I'd say Brandon, Hoppy doesn't wanna

70
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,340
be set free, he likes it here.

71
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,050
If we put him in the washing machine

72
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:04,462
one more time, he won't
have any eyes left.

73
00:07:04,462 --> 00:07:05,420
(chuckling)

74
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,510
- His ear's molding.

75
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:09,790
- We can wash him.

76
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,820
- Hoppy lives.

77
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:16,218
(soft music)

78
00:07:34,302 --> 00:07:37,001
- Come on Liebowitz, you can do it.

79
00:07:37,001 --> 00:07:39,558
(chain dragging)

80
00:07:39,558 --> 00:07:41,975
(soft music)

81
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,130
- All this change is making me hungry.

82
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,230
Are you hungry Piper?

83
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,520
- I'm straight.

84
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,353
- Oh good.

85
00:07:58,257 --> 00:07:59,720
I wasn't sure.

86
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,280
I like how you're upfront
about these things.

87
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,113
- I meant about the food.

88
00:08:03,113 --> 00:08:05,950
- Listen honey, I bought some
strawberries from one of those

89
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:09,690
Mexicans on the corner,
they're big as plums.

90
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,830
The berries not the Mexicans.

91
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,720
Would you like me to get you some?

92
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,553
- Sure, why not?

93
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:31,058
(soft music)

94
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,400
- I'm thinking about
asking Yuan to marry me.

95
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:45,160
No I'm gonna ask Yuan to marry me.

96
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,160
- Wow, that's amazing.

97
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,810
- I'm gonna ask my parents
for my grandmother's ring.

98
00:08:55,745 --> 00:08:57,995
(inhaling)

99
00:08:59,484 --> 00:09:00,840
(exhaling)

100
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,960
- Rats.

101
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,793
Damn.

102
00:09:04,022 --> 00:09:04,855
(laughing)

103
00:09:04,855 --> 00:09:05,688
Wow.

104
00:09:05,688 --> 00:09:06,750
- I feel really good about it.

105
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,600
- And you should.

106
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,433
Wow.

107
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,270
You are like the most adult person I know.

108
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,690
(laughing)

109
00:09:26,581 --> 00:09:28,355
- You know adults.

110
00:09:28,355 --> 00:09:30,605
(laughing)

111
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:37,510
- I do.

112
00:09:50,859 --> 00:09:53,692
- It's good to have help for once.

113
00:09:55,301 --> 00:09:56,134
- Yeah.

114
00:09:57,254 --> 00:09:58,087
Yeah sure.

115
00:10:04,117 --> 00:10:07,700
- I have a whole new
vision for this house.

116
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:11,632
New rugs.

117
00:10:12,534 --> 00:10:13,760
New couch.

118
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,677
New people.

119
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,610
I have to tell you Piper, every morning

120
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:23,170
I wake up and I say
Mary, today is a new day.

121
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,350
You have to believe there is a god above

122
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:28,730
who is shedding his light where need be.

123
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,300
But then come the emails, and
the doctor's appointments,

124
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,310
and that damn dog
shitting everywhere again.

125
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,350
And the roof.

126
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,840
Don't get me started with that.

127
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,340
And before you know it it's
four pm and you just wanna

128
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,800
say screw it and make yourself a cocktail.

129
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:49,170
- Well, we will have this
place spic and span in no time.

130
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:56,750
- I should let you go.

131
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:58,790
You're tired.

132
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,160
You must have homework.

133
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,180
- Honestly I don't mind.

134
00:11:04,277 --> 00:11:05,930
I need to the money.

135
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,450
- I have this special ability

136
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,100
to know what people are thinking.

137
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,260
I'm emotionally absorbent, like a sponge.

138
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,340
It's a blessing and a cursing.

139
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:25,340
You feel something and it's
like wow, I feel it too.

140
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,100
- I can go finish in the office?

141
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,020
- Great idea.

142
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:36,920
You do that.

143
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,340
And try this on.

144
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,660
I think it's your size.

145
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:45,610
- You're too kind.

146
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,160
Seriously.

147
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:48,993
- Oh.

148
00:11:55,861 --> 00:11:58,361
(eerie music)

149
00:12:32,981 --> 00:12:33,979
- [Adam] This is it?

150
00:12:33,979 --> 00:12:34,997
- [Brandon] Yeah.

151
00:12:34,997 --> 00:12:36,155
Home sweet home.

152
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,655
Who's car is that?

153
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,143
- You're asking me?

154
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:49,739
- [Man] Live not a low life.

155
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:51,739
Remember and forget not.

156
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:53,852
- Where should I put my stuff?

157
00:12:53,852 --> 00:12:55,220
- In the corner by the shoes.

158
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,053
- Mm hm.

159
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,390
So, I take off my shoes?

160
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,700
Or I'll just keep'um on.

161
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,419
- Oh fuck.

162
00:13:30,681 --> 00:13:32,181
Oh fuh ah ah yeah.

163
00:13:56,398 --> 00:13:57,231
(urine flowing)

164
00:13:57,231 --> 00:13:58,064
Oh.

165
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:00,259
Ah.

166
00:14:00,259 --> 00:14:02,926
(urine flowing)

167
00:14:08,659 --> 00:14:11,409
- [Adam] What's up with the roof?

168
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:13,739
- I thought they fixed that.

169
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,190
- This is a lot of stuff.

170
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,673
- Yonk.

171
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:39,973
Hoppy.

172
00:14:43,017 --> 00:14:43,990
Yes.

173
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,930
Strawberries?

174
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:53,330
- Dana used to love strawberries.

175
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,450
Last year I got her chocolate-covered

176
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,950
strawberries for her birthday,

177
00:14:57,761 --> 00:14:58,594
then we had sex.

178
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:02,323
- Right.

179
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,620
Okay, so here's the deal.

180
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,453
We say hello.

181
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:11,000
Drive into town, get some food.

182
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,390
Then tonight, I get the ring,
we're outta here by Sunday.

183
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,250
- Sounds like a plan.

184
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,600
- You don't understand.

185
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,450
They're gonna want us to
stay as long as possible.

186
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:21,830
Don't let them suck you in.

187
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:22,880
- Got it, no sucking.

188
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,860
- The ring's beautiful man.

189
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,860
It was my grandmother's from Berlin.

190
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,710
- I love Berlin.

191
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,510
So much history.

192
00:15:36,118 --> 00:15:38,618
(dog barking)

193
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:41,483
- Liebowitz.

194
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:44,219
- Who's Liebowitz?

195
00:15:44,219 --> 00:15:45,052
- She's out dog.

196
00:15:45,052 --> 00:15:46,500
She's awesome.

197
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,260
She's like awesome all the time.

198
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,910
We have a real connection.

199
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,530
Liebowitz!

200
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:52,363
Liebowitz!

201
00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:55,457
Liebowitz!

202
00:15:55,457 --> 00:15:56,994
Liebowitz!

203
00:15:56,994 --> 00:15:57,827
- [Mary] Brandon!

204
00:15:57,827 --> 00:15:58,660
Brandon!

205
00:16:01,934 --> 00:16:03,260
Brandon!

206
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,420
- [Brandon] Hey Mom.

207
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,020
- You said tomorrow.

208
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,040
- Yeah, I got the day
off so I'm here early.

209
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,780
- Oh my son, I'm not prepared.

210
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,510
My son is home!

211
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,740
- Oh okay, take it easy.

212
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,130
- You have bags under your eyes.

213
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,650
- Yeah, I've been working late.

214
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:20,280
- Are you taking those vitamins
I gave you for your hair?

215
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,870
- What's all this stuff doing out?

216
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,610
- Oh, I'm organizing.

217
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:28,030
You have to take everything out
so you know what you've got.

218
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,560
I was planning to surprise you.

219
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,830
Have you walk in and go whoa,

220
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,630
look what she's done to the house.

221
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,780
That was my goal.

222
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,558
But I missed my goal.

223
00:16:35,558 --> 00:16:36,530
(laughing)

224
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,081
- Hmm.

225
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:39,450
Hey Mom, this is Adam.

226
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:41,074
- Pleased to meet you.

227
00:16:41,074 --> 00:16:43,000
- Oh, I'm not wearing any makeup.

228
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,470
- That's cool, neither am I.

229
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,739
- Um, please don't mind the mess.

230
00:16:47,739 --> 00:16:50,480
You have to imagine what it will look like

231
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,650
with a new coat of yellow paint.

232
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,610
A new sofa, some paintings on the wall.

233
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,340
And, well you just have
to use your imagination.

234
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,173
- I can see it.

235
00:16:59,289 --> 00:17:00,950
(coughing)

236
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:01,900
- Uh oh, is he okay?

237
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,733
- [Brandon] Yeah, he's fine.

238
00:17:02,733 --> 00:17:04,371
- [Adam] I'm fine.

239
00:17:04,371 --> 00:17:05,510
- Your eyes are bloodshot.

240
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,130
- It's pollen.

241
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:09,340
- Are you in pain?

242
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,570
Do you need a painkiller?

243
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,190
- Adam just got out of this really

244
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,050
just awful abusive relationship.

245
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,050
- [Adam] Dude.

246
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,890
- [Mary] I'll definitely
get you a painkiller.

247
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,180
- Mom, what are you
doing with painkillers?

248
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,580
- Oh, I don't have any painkillers.

249
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,420
Your father has'um from the surgery.

250
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,850
- Oh, speaking of, where is he?

251
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,630
- Relationships can be so confusing.

252
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,520
You're just two people
who agree to these rules,

253
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,230
and then someone comes along
and it erases all the lines.

254
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:36,620
And you're like, but
Dicky there was a rule.

255
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,890
You can't take the dog.

256
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,290
He's not your dog he's our dog.

257
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,850
Don't yell at me because
I don't walk the dog.

258
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,333
- Totally.

259
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,130
- Oh god, I'm sorry!

260
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,073
Mom.

261
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,840
There's a girl in Dad's office.

262
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,673
- That's Piper.

263
00:18:05,516 --> 00:18:06,349
- She's not wearing any clothes.

264
00:18:06,349 --> 00:18:07,480
- I found her on Craigslist.

265
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,380
- If I had known we were having

266
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,580
company I would've worn underwear.

267
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,790
- It's my son.

268
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,260
My son is here.

269
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,670
- Hi, it's nice to meet you.

270
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,840
- I'm almost done with
the files in the office.

271
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,600
Mind if we finish up tomorrow?

272
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,090
- Absolutely, I have my son with me.

273
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,410
I'll see you tomorrow Pipe.

274
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:33,860
- Thanks again for the dress.

275
00:18:35,131 --> 00:18:37,464
(chuckling)

276
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,542
(sighing)

277
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:46,880
- She seems nice.

278
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,920
- How did you know Brandon?

279
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,700
- We met freshman year at Oberlin Mom.

280
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,320
- It's actually kind of a funny story.

281
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,650
See I get these really bad migraines.

282
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:54,500
- That's not funny.

283
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,400
- Ma, where's Dad?

284
00:18:56,353 --> 00:18:57,186
- I know about migraines.

285
00:18:57,186 --> 00:18:58,220
Travis used to get them all the time.

286
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,260
- Okay, let's, not that.

287
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,423
- And I used to hold his temple

288
00:19:01,423 --> 00:19:03,080
and put a warm towel over his eyes.

289
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,440
- [Brandon] Mom where is Dad?

290
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,080
- He went out in the car, okay?

291
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,430
He took the car.

292
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:09,821
- Did the doctor tell'um
he's not supposed to drive?

293
00:19:09,821 --> 00:19:11,185
- Do you think he listens to a doctor?

294
00:19:11,185 --> 00:19:12,340
- He just had his surgery.

295
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,120
- You think I didn't tell him that?

296
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,060
I said Dicky don't take the car.

297
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,560
He said, I don't care
what the doctor says.

298
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,100
I haven't been in an accident since '97.

299
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,630
And I said, then how many
fingers am I holding up.

300
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,400
And he says, one!

301
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,490
- Okay, where is he?

302
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,170
- Do you really wanna have this

303
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,780
conversation in front of your guest?

304
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,510
- Mom, what's going on?

305
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,480
Where's Dad?

306
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,880
And what are you doing to this house?

307
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,450
- I'm giving it love!

308
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,000
The house needed some love!

309
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,080
Someone has to give it.

310
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,520
It wasn't going to be him.

311
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,690
It wasn't going to be you.

312
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,420
It wasn't going to be Liebowitz.

313
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,100
Liebowitz pees on the rug.

314
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,370
I don't wanna live in a
house with piss on the rug.

315
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,520
Why am I defending myself to you Brandon?

316
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,560
Stop attacking me.

317
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,700
- I'm not attacking you.

318
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,600
- Both of you are always attacking me.

319
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:03,431
I'm just trying to give the
house some care and love.

320
00:20:03,431 --> 00:20:05,681
(creaking)

321
00:20:08,268 --> 00:20:09,101
- So which room am I staying in?

322
00:20:09,101 --> 00:20:10,120
- You'll stay in my room.

323
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,250
- That's the art room.

324
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,490
- Fine, he'll stay in the guestroom.

325
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:13,630
- Where will you stay Brandon?

326
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,560
- I'll stay down here.

327
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,372
- He should stay in the bud room.

328
00:20:16,372 --> 00:20:17,460
(creaking)

329
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,293
- Guestroom is fine.

330
00:20:18,293 --> 00:20:19,300
- I'll put on fresh sheets.

331
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,706
- But--

332
00:20:20,706 --> 00:20:21,987
- Brandon don't worry about your father.

333
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,240
- How could you let him
drive when he can't see?

334
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,290
- He's not worth worrying about!

335
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,220
This is a wonderful town, relax.

336
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,110
Have a drink.

337
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,240
I know I will.

338
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,150
Then you can go mingle
with the young folk.

339
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,230
Do what you boys like to do.

340
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:43,810
If you want I can come.

341
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,030
But only if you want.

342
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:48,460
If not, I'll work on my dinnerware.

343
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,680
I make dinnerware in a kiln.

344
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,780
I sell it at a crafts fair.

345
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,590
Did Brandon tell you about me?

346
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,220
Just Brandon talk about me?

347
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,040
What do you do again?

348
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,990
- Ah, I'm an illustrator.

349
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,630
- An artist.

350
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:05,660
The creative path is never easy.

351
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:08,790
It's enough to drive a person insane.

352
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:11,650
Look at what happened to Camille Claudel.

353
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,470
I'm actually writing a book about it.

354
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,860
I just haven't put it on paper yet.

355
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,530
But it's all in my head.

356
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,967
He has nice hair, doesn't he Brandon?

357
00:21:20,967 --> 00:21:21,800
- Yeah.

358
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,633
- Very shiny.

359
00:21:22,633 --> 00:21:24,600
Such nice hair.

360
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,760
- Oh my god, I just realized
I'm not wearing my hair.

361
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,593
Don't look.

362
00:21:28,593 --> 00:21:30,490
I didn't finish getting dressed.

363
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,965
Oh dear.

364
00:21:31,965 --> 00:21:32,950
Come back.

365
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:33,890
Go outside.

366
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,170
Take a walk then come back.

367
00:21:38,705 --> 00:21:39,538
I like your shirt.

368
00:21:39,538 --> 00:21:41,750
That's the color I'm gonna
paint the living room.

369
00:21:47,308 --> 00:21:48,410
(door closing)

370
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,140
- So, your mom?

371
00:21:52,409 --> 00:21:54,009
- [Man] The world is in need.

372
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:56,759
(glass clanking)

373
00:21:58,606 --> 00:22:00,284
(glass clanking)

374
00:22:00,284 --> 00:22:01,451
See the light.

375
00:22:03,006 --> 00:22:03,839
(grunting)

376
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:04,980
- What's the bud room?

377
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,290
- The basement.

378
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:07,710
- Why is it called the bud room?

379
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:11,059
(sighing)

380
00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:11,892
- I can't.

381
00:22:11,892 --> 00:22:13,933
I really just can't get
into that right now.

382
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:16,883
- [Man] Live not a low life.

383
00:22:16,883 --> 00:22:19,342
Remember and forget not.

384
00:22:19,342 --> 00:22:20,420
(humming)

385
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,930
Follow not raw ideas.

386
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:23,773
Sink not into the world.

387
00:22:23,773 --> 00:22:26,220
(humming)

388
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,350
- Alright, I should
probably go someplace else.

389
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,380
- No, no, no.

390
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,850
'Cause if you leave now, she's gonna

391
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:31,720
think it's because of her alright?

392
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,100
- I hate to say but it kind of is.

393
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,663
Yes.

394
00:22:34,663 --> 00:22:36,180
- [Mary] Hello boys.

395
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,013
- Christ.

396
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:41,620
- Please forgive my little outburst.

397
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:45,467
I went upstairs and meditated
with my Buddha statue.

398
00:22:45,467 --> 00:22:47,110
And now I'm perfectly domicile.

399
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:49,703
- Docile.

400
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:50,680
- I take it back, you should probably

401
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,362
leave as soon as possible.

402
00:22:52,362 --> 00:22:54,040
- It's so nice to have boys in the house.

403
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,120
You bring in the energy.

404
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,790
You bring in the life.

405
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:00,630
I feel revitalized just looking at you.

406
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,150
- Yeah, I need a taxi.

407
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,490
- Who are you talking to Brandon?

408
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,870
- I'm calling a taxi Mom.

409
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:05,820
- Why would you do that?

410
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,820
- Adam has to leave.

411
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,710
- Is this because of my house?

412
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:12,620
- No, he's not feeling so well.

413
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,080
- Ah, my allergies.

414
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,950
- Oh no, I scared your friend.

415
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,510
- No Mom, you're fine.

416
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,970
- No, I'm scary.

417
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,110
I scared your friend.

418
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:20,990
I look hideous.

419
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,450
I'm a hideous woman aren't I?

420
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,970
- No you're beautiful Mom.

421
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:24,870
- No I'm ugly.

422
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,250
This is why he's going.

423
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,680
I'm ugly and I'm hideous.

424
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,510
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

425
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,890
- Fine, call a taxi, I won't look at you.

426
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,410
You don't have to look at me.

427
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:34,500
I'll go back to my room.

428
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,840
I'll shut the door.

429
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,220
I'll turn off the lights.

430
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,240
I'll go under the sheets.

431
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,690
And I'll close my eyes so
you don't have to see me.

432
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:44,580
I'll hold my breath so you
don't have to hear me breathing.

433
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,970
I was just trying to organize.

434
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:48,720
I was cleaning.

435
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,160
I was (mumbling) your
guest with clean sheets.

436
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,490
- [Brandon] Mom, it's okay.

437
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:54,320
Please, you're not ugly.

438
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,720
- Don't lie to me Brandon.

439
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,553
- Mom please.

440
00:23:56,553 --> 00:23:57,840
- I'm an ugly monster.

441
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,380
The neighbors are right!

442
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,330
- Mom please.

443
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:05,140
I'm trying to help you.

444
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,070
But you have to tell me
what happened to Dad?

445
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:10,603
- I don't know what's going on.

446
00:24:10,603 --> 00:24:11,436
(crying)

447
00:24:11,436 --> 00:24:13,375
I've been left in the dark.

448
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:15,458
(crying)

449
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,450
- I can see what you were
saying about the house.

450
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:31,870
And what it will look like when
you paint the walls yellow.

451
00:24:35,034 --> 00:24:35,867
I can see it.

452
00:24:35,867 --> 00:24:36,700
And my guess is that you

453
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,070
you're probably an incredible cook.

454
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:41,843
Right?

455
00:24:41,843 --> 00:24:43,900
- You're just saying that.

456
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,790
How can you say that?

457
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,623
- No, no, no, no.

458
00:24:46,623 --> 00:24:48,804
I like this.

459
00:24:48,804 --> 00:24:50,640
Like, I really like older homes.

460
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,490
And I like the energy.

461
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:55,010
I can see the eclectic taste here.

462
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,210
It's a little funky but

463
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,870
I like the energy.

464
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,230
- Oh please call me Mary.

465
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,415
- Mary.

466
00:25:05,415 --> 00:25:07,457
(chuckling)

467
00:25:07,457 --> 00:25:08,290
- [Brandon] How long has he been gone for?

468
00:25:09,238 --> 00:25:11,388
- Ah, three days to
four, I don't remember.

469
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,590
- Okay, we're good.

470
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:19,510
We have to drive around
and see if we can find him.

471
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,383
- Wait.

472
00:25:20,383 --> 00:25:21,216
Don't leave me.

473
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,064
- Okay.

474
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,736
It's okay, it's okay,
I'm not going anywhere.

475
00:25:25,736 --> 00:25:28,569
(heavy breathing)

476
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,350
Adam, could you do me a huge favor?

477
00:25:38,712 --> 00:25:39,800
- [Man] A man who wisely controls

478
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,820
his senses as a good driver.

479
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,910
- [Adam] Stop sign.

480
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:43,880
Stop sign.

481
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,713
Stop sign!

482
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:47,660
That was a stop sign.

483
00:25:48,595 --> 00:25:51,012
(soft music)

484
00:26:11,214 --> 00:26:13,381
(buzzing)

485
00:26:14,552 --> 00:26:16,060
- You're such a nice young man.

486
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,720
Being so kind to an old day like me.

487
00:26:20,014 --> 00:26:20,847
- I just thought it might be nice.

488
00:26:20,847 --> 00:26:22,410
- But taking me out to dinner.

489
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:26,050
- Yeah this is dinner.

490
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,616
- I know.

491
00:26:28,616 --> 00:26:29,550
What did you think it was?

492
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,383
- Well nothing.

493
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,730
- People need to eat.

494
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:41,375
(phone vibrating)

495
00:26:43,722 --> 00:26:46,470
- No (mumbling) now baby.

496
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,850
- I wonder if Brandon found Dicky.

497
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:49,950
I'm going to call him.

498
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:54,950
I've got a smart phone.

499
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,448
(chuckling)

500
00:26:57,448 --> 00:27:00,365
(soft happy music)

501
00:27:06,928 --> 00:27:07,931
(chuckling)

502
00:27:07,931 --> 00:27:09,010
Stupid smart phone.

503
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:10,100
It's not working.

504
00:27:11,144 --> 00:27:14,080
(soft music)

505
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:14,913
- Can I see it?

506
00:27:18,753 --> 00:27:20,113
(sighing)

507
00:27:20,113 --> 00:27:20,946
Hmm.

508
00:27:20,946 --> 00:27:22,220
There.

509
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,320
- How did you do that?

510
00:27:24,774 --> 00:27:25,820
- I just turned it on.

511
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,720
- Thank you.

512
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,650
I'm going to text him.

513
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:33,963
Brandon.

514
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,250
Call

515
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,560
me.

516
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,820
No not meat.

517
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,730
Oh shoot, I sent it.

518
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,820
Now it says Montana.

519
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,420
- Hm, that's the corrected text.

520
00:27:52,285 --> 00:27:53,635
- Oh shoot I sent it again.

521
00:27:55,404 --> 00:27:56,704
How do I get it to unsend?

522
00:27:58,925 --> 00:28:01,600
Oh great, I just told
Brandon to call Montana.

523
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,850
Oh now I sent it to my gynecologist.

524
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:06,800
- Here let me just.

525
00:28:10,786 --> 00:28:13,540
(phone vibrating)

526
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,373
- Jesus.

527
00:28:18,437 --> 00:28:21,616
(spoon rattling)

528
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:24,033
(soft music)

529
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:40,270
- Dicky hates this place.

530
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:43,610
He can't see so I have to read
him the items off the menu.

531
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:49,760
- How exactly did your
husband hurt his eyes?

532
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,110
- Well, Dicky likes to get his sun.

533
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:57,430
So he was outside
suntanning in his sun chair

534
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,890
when he doses off with his eyes open.

535
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,180
A few moments later he wakes up screaming.

536
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:09,980
I thought that was it.

537
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,160
Goodbye Dicky's eyes.

538
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,900
But the doctors are optimistic

539
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,500
that he'll be able to see again.

540
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:20,020
You have beautiful eyes.

541
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:22,240
Does anyone ever tell you that?

542
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,073
- Not really.

543
00:29:23,073 --> 00:29:25,080
- There so full of color and heartbreak.

544
00:29:26,696 --> 00:29:27,529
- I don't know about that.

545
00:29:27,529 --> 00:29:28,700
- Yes.

546
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,850
- I'm an artist, I can see these things.

547
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,140
That's the hard thing about life.

548
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,890
You have to keep your heart open

549
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:41,330
no matter how many times
people step all over it.

550
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:47,415
(cars passing)

551
00:29:51,357 --> 00:29:53,690
(sad music)

552
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,590
- Welcome to, hi.

553
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,770
- What are you doing here?

554
00:30:15,222 --> 00:30:16,055
- I work here.

555
00:30:16,055 --> 00:30:16,888
- You do?

556
00:30:17,739 --> 00:30:18,690
- I have two jobs.

557
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:19,740
- Good for you.

558
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,930
You must need money.

559
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,580
- So can I start you off
with something to drink?

560
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,413
- Let's see.

561
00:30:28,379 --> 00:30:30,690
I feel weird asking the
help to get us drinks.

562
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:32,624
- You know I can hear you.

563
00:30:32,624 --> 00:30:33,880
- What do you wanna drink?

564
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,110
- Let's see, what's fun?

565
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:38,783
I know.

566
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,340
How 'bout the blue raspberry
slush with Red Bull?

567
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:48,270
- She'll have the blue
raspberry slush with Red Bull.

568
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,520
- Sugar-free Red Bull.

569
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,490
- Sugar-free Red Bull.

570
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:52,040
- Don't skimp on the Red Bull.

571
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,920
- You want the hula, it's double the size?

572
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,530
- That sounds like too much.

573
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:57,150
- You do get to keep the glass.

574
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:58,250
- Sold.

575
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,916
- And for you son?

576
00:30:59,916 --> 00:31:00,749
- Oh no, no.

577
00:31:00,749 --> 00:31:01,582
- He's not.

578
00:31:01,582 --> 00:31:04,060
- I'm Adam, not Brandon.

579
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,300
- Right, I mixed you two up there.

580
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,858
- Really?

581
00:31:07,858 --> 00:31:08,914
- No.

582
00:31:08,914 --> 00:31:11,220
- Adam, would you like
a hula with Red Bull?

583
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,430
- Um, water's fine.

584
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,840
- Alright, I'll be right back.

585
00:31:16,071 --> 00:31:18,488
(soft music)

586
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:24,870
- You keep looking at her.

587
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:26,953
- I do?

588
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,760
- She's your type isn't she?

589
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,012
- Oh no.

590
00:31:31,012 --> 00:31:32,036
Mm mm, not really.

591
00:31:32,036 --> 00:31:32,869
- Yes she is, I can tell.

592
00:31:32,869 --> 00:31:35,470
You like a girl who's gonna
rough you up a little.

593
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,303
- What?

594
00:31:36,303 --> 00:31:38,890
- It's so good to see
people come together.

595
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:40,920
Beautiful to see that magical

596
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,870
connection for the very first time.

597
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:43,703
I remember that.

598
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,520
I actually happen to know
her on a personal level.

599
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,960
So if you want me to say something.

600
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,908
- Please don't say anything.

601
00:31:51,908 --> 00:31:52,741
- I'm really good at this.

602
00:31:52,741 --> 00:31:54,120
Saying things is sort of my specialty.

603
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:54,953
- I don't want you to.

604
00:31:54,953 --> 00:31:56,010
- But I want to.

605
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:57,710
- I don't want you to.

606
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,810
- You're so bashful.

607
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:01,730
Look at you blushing.

608
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:02,970
Oh.

609
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:03,967
(laughing)

610
00:32:03,967 --> 00:32:04,800
This is fun.

611
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,310
I needed to have some fun.

612
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,740
- Well at lease you're having fun.

613
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,070
- It's so wonderful you're
friends with Brandon.

614
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:27,070
He used to be so close with his brother.

615
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,570
- Brother?

616
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:30,403
- [Mary] Travis.

617
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,630
- I didn't know he had a brother.

618
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:35,340
- He's no longer with us.

619
00:32:36,616 --> 00:32:39,033
(soft music)

620
00:32:42,056 --> 00:32:42,960
- I had no idea.

621
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,980
- Okay, here is your water.

622
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:50,480
And your blue raspberry slush
with sugar-free Red Bull.

623
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,313
- Thanks.

624
00:32:54,293 --> 00:32:55,126
- Okay.

625
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,620
- Let's share the fried zucchini.

626
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,430
Guess we're sharing the fried zucchini.

627
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,920
- Anything else?

628
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,793
- Piper this is Adam.

629
00:33:03,793 --> 00:33:04,626
- We've already met.

630
00:33:04,626 --> 00:33:05,630
- Adam is an illustrator.

631
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:07,280
The next Vincent van Gogh.

632
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,330
- Well hopefully not.

633
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,300
- Such a nice boy.

634
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,780
Beautiful eyes, don't you think?

635
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,180
- Stop it.

636
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,013
- Why?

637
00:33:15,013 --> 00:33:16,300
- You're young, she's young.

638
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,500
Go on, talk.

639
00:33:18,776 --> 00:33:20,291
Tell her what you want.

640
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:22,708
(soft music)

641
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,350
- I want a cheeseburger, medium.

642
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:28,363
- Okay and

643
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:30,440
for you?

644
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,590
- I'll have your hair.

645
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:34,950
She has nice hair.

646
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,970
I was making a joke.

647
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:38,510
I'm not allowed to make a joke?

648
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,480
She has nice hair.

649
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,650
- Sure.

650
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:44,373
- Go ahead, tell her.

651
00:33:44,373 --> 00:33:46,790
(soft music)

652
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:54,460
- Um,

653
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,080
you have nice hair.

654
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,470
- He thinks you have nice hair.

655
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,180
- Okay, you don't have to
repeat me after I say it.

656
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,710
- There's nothing wrong with complimenting

657
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:01,730
a woman on her hair.

658
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:03,450
It's not like she's gonna have it forever.

659
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:04,283
- Enough!

660
00:34:05,829 --> 00:34:08,246
(soft music)

661
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,450
- I'll have the shrimp Key West.

662
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:17,189
- I will be right back with that.

663
00:34:17,189 --> 00:34:19,606
(soft music)

664
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:25,410
- Stop embarrassing me.

665
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:26,650
- I'm embarrassing you?

666
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:28,210
- Saw a love connection.

667
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:31,710
- Okay, thank you, but I like
just got out of a relationship

668
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,860
this morning, so I
don't need you for that.

669
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,580
(banging)

670
00:34:47,108 --> 00:34:49,941
(emotional music)

671
00:35:00,075 --> 00:35:03,056
(phone vibrating)

672
00:35:03,056 --> 00:35:05,889
(emotional music)

673
00:35:09,717 --> 00:35:11,120
(sighing)

674
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,080
- I should check on Brandon,
see if he's found Dicky.

675
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,130
- That's a good idea.

676
00:35:19,493 --> 00:35:22,213
(phone vibrating)

677
00:35:22,213 --> 00:35:25,492
(emotional music)

678
00:35:25,492 --> 00:35:27,888
(phone vibrating)

679
00:35:27,888 --> 00:35:30,721
(emotional music)

680
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,800
- Want some slushy?

681
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,860
- No thanks.

682
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,136
- You sure?

683
00:35:57,136 --> 00:35:57,969
It's delicious.

684
00:36:01,167 --> 00:36:04,213
(slurping)

685
00:36:04,213 --> 00:36:06,463
(slurping)

686
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:14,563
- Happy now?

687
00:36:14,563 --> 00:36:16,510
- I said some.

688
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,780
If you're that thirsty
get your own damn slushy.

689
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:21,675
- I'm just trying to get
through this dinner okay?

690
00:36:21,675 --> 00:36:24,092
(soft music)

691
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,230
I'm sorry that was rude.

692
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,330
- No, I understand.

693
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:36,100
I know what I'm like.

694
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,720
People tell me.

695
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,720
Dicky tells me.

696
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:43,400
- Um, I'm really sorry about Travis.

697
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,940
- They used to throw rocks at him

698
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,440
when we would walk to school.

699
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:53,260
Brandon gave him his hockey helmet

700
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,980
to protect him from the rocks.

701
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,260
And he wore it everyday.

702
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:03,780
When Brandon went to college,
Travis was devastated.

703
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:07,140
He spent two years held
up in the bud room until

704
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:10,240
he finally got a job at a gas station.

705
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:14,010
Dicky would go ballistic.

706
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:16,680
How could his son work at a gas station?

707
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:21,170
He would come in for gas and Travis

708
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:23,150
would whack him with a squeegee.

709
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:27,210
And they would go at each
other all night long.

710
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:30,340
And with Brandon not there
to come to Travis' defense

711
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:34,250
the only thing that would
comfort him were back scratches.

712
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:37,610
He was 25 and that's what I had to do.

713
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:41,060
And no it wasn't sexual.

714
00:37:42,512 --> 00:37:43,362
I was his mother.

715
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,780
It was only that once.

716
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:49,920
On Christmas day at the gas station,

717
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:54,360
he killed a squirrel and set
it on fire along with a tire.

718
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,840
He blackened everything to a crisp.

719
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:01,590
Some of the gas station
caught fire as a result.

720
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:04,010
There was a lawsuit.

721
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:06,770
I think Dicky blamed himself in someway.

722
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:11,260
To this day, he still goes back to that

723
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:14,580
gas station returning to the scene.

724
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,280
- Here are your zucchini fritters.

725
00:38:18,331 --> 00:38:19,164
- Uh oh.

726
00:38:19,164 --> 00:38:19,997
What's wrong?

727
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:21,883
- Ah, migraine.

728
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:22,810
- Are you okay bud?

729
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:23,890
- I think we need to go.

730
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:25,800
- Oh damn, this was fun.

731
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,880
- I'll pay for the zucchini.

732
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,870
- Is there anything I can do?

733
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:33,289
- Put them in the bag.

734
00:38:33,289 --> 00:38:36,950
Don't worry, momma's taking care of you.

735
00:38:39,313 --> 00:38:40,390
- I need to go right now.

736
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,140
- Hang tight.

737
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:50,240
We're almost

738
00:38:51,573 --> 00:38:52,406
there.

739
00:38:56,555 --> 00:38:58,900
(screaming)

740
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,770
- Light.

741
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:00,603
- Light, uh.

742
00:39:00,603 --> 00:39:02,100
So light's no good for a migraine.

743
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,300
I'll turn off the light.

744
00:39:04,649 --> 00:39:05,830
(screaming)

745
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:07,330
Oh, off the light.

746
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:08,690
Wait that's the hallway.

747
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,820
That's the patio.

748
00:39:12,067 --> 00:39:13,550
(groaning)

749
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:15,100
We need to get you an eye bath.

750
00:39:17,353 --> 00:39:18,186
(groaning)

751
00:39:18,186 --> 00:39:19,480
Look, here.

752
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:22,032
This is an eye mask.

753
00:39:27,362 --> 00:39:28,444
- [Adam] Fiorinal.

754
00:39:28,444 --> 00:39:29,463
A Fiorinal.

755
00:39:29,463 --> 00:39:30,460
- [Mary] Tylenol.

756
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,293
- [Adam] Fiorinal, in the bag.

757
00:39:31,293 --> 00:39:32,126
Blue and red.

758
00:39:34,502 --> 00:39:37,194
(moaning)

759
00:39:37,194 --> 00:39:39,550
(grunting)

760
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:40,818
- Let's see.

761
00:39:40,818 --> 00:39:43,234
(grunting)

762
00:39:43,234 --> 00:39:45,400
- Oh, how many do you want?

763
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,233
Two.

764
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:48,643
Okay.

765
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:52,183
(moaning)

766
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:57,340
You need some water?

767
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,540
I'll get you some water.

768
00:39:59,738 --> 00:40:02,238
(eerie music)

769
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,753
Here we go.

770
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:18,330
And this.

771
00:40:20,696 --> 00:40:23,196
(eerie music)

772
00:40:48,732 --> 00:40:50,899
(moaning)

773
00:40:54,486 --> 00:40:55,319
Okay.

774
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,730
You got your pills.

775
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:01,733
What else?

776
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:03,843
I know.

777
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,230
I'll light a candle.

778
00:41:08,642 --> 00:41:11,142
(eerie music)

779
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:16,915
(moaning)

780
00:41:16,915 --> 00:41:19,415
(eerie music)

781
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,370
Isn't that calming?

782
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:32,610
It feels good on your eyes.

783
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:34,535
Doesn't it?

784
00:41:34,535 --> 00:41:36,323
(mumbling)

785
00:41:36,323 --> 00:41:38,910
If you need something just
tap me on the shoulder.

786
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:42,090
Or, nod your head.

787
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,462
- [Adam] Uh huh.

788
00:41:44,462 --> 00:41:45,295
- Or shake your foot.

789
00:41:47,108 --> 00:41:47,941
Oh, uh.

790
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:52,614
- [Adam] My love war.

791
00:41:52,614 --> 00:41:53,447
- What?

792
00:41:53,447 --> 00:41:54,970
I didn't follow.

793
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,640
- [Adam] My love war.

794
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,410
- Who takes care of you when this happens?

795
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:01,400
Does anybody take care of you?

796
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:03,463
- My.

797
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,630
No.

798
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:07,463
Dark.

799
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:09,810
(moaning)

800
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:11,550
- You're just like Travis.

801
00:42:13,666 --> 00:42:16,470
(moaning)

802
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:17,303
Travis.

803
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,970
I know what to do with you.

804
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:23,083
Come on.

805
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,295
We're going to the bud room.

806
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:28,128
- No.

807
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:31,870
- Yes, it's very dark.

808
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:33,490
You'll love it.

809
00:42:34,614 --> 00:42:35,447
It's absolutely perfect down there.

810
00:42:36,295 --> 00:42:37,128
- [Adam] No.

811
00:42:37,128 --> 00:42:37,961
No I don't wanna go there.

812
00:42:37,961 --> 00:42:39,050
- [Mary] There's a futon.

813
00:42:40,673 --> 00:42:43,268
You'll sleep better.

814
00:42:43,268 --> 00:42:44,775
- [Adam] No.

815
00:42:44,775 --> 00:42:46,171
No.

816
00:42:46,171 --> 00:42:47,532
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

817
00:42:47,532 --> 00:42:48,536
- [Mary] Yes.

818
00:42:48,536 --> 00:42:50,095
It's very dark.

819
00:42:50,095 --> 00:42:50,928
- No, no, no, no.

820
00:42:50,928 --> 00:42:55,156
This really doesn't seem like a good I...

821
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:58,156
(suspenseful music)

822
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:22,547
(mumbling)

823
00:43:25,695 --> 00:43:28,695
(suspenseful music)

824
00:44:38,537 --> 00:44:41,287
(fire crackling)

825
00:44:42,713 --> 00:44:45,713
(suspenseful music)

826
00:45:03,833 --> 00:45:04,666
- You're

827
00:45:05,593 --> 00:45:06,614
such

828
00:45:06,614 --> 00:45:07,796
a

829
00:45:07,796 --> 00:45:08,629
good

830
00:45:09,753 --> 00:45:10,586
boy.

831
00:45:12,937 --> 00:45:15,937
(suspenseful music)

832
00:45:18,473 --> 00:45:21,140
(alarm beeping)

833
00:45:22,713 --> 00:45:25,713
(suspenseful music)

834
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:35,103
Uh oh.

835
00:45:38,196 --> 00:45:41,196
(suspenseful music)

836
00:45:59,439 --> 00:46:02,697
(alarm beeping)

837
00:46:02,697 --> 00:46:05,697
(suspenseful music)

838
00:46:11,471 --> 00:46:12,902
- Shit, Mom!

839
00:46:12,902 --> 00:46:13,735
Mom!

840
00:46:15,058 --> 00:46:16,057
- Oh, shoot!

841
00:46:16,057 --> 00:46:17,097
The candle.

842
00:46:17,097 --> 00:46:18,847
- Ma, get some water!

843
00:46:19,896 --> 00:46:21,952
(grunting)

844
00:46:21,952 --> 00:46:23,540
Those are dry flowers!

845
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:25,119
What the fuck!

846
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:26,116
- [Mary] Come on!

847
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,449
Oh, come on now!

848
00:46:28,895 --> 00:46:29,772
Down.

849
00:46:29,772 --> 00:46:30,993
Down!

850
00:46:30,993 --> 00:46:31,826
Stop it!

851
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:35,666
(pan clanking)

852
00:46:35,666 --> 00:46:36,966
- Damn it.

853
00:46:36,966 --> 00:46:37,799
Fuck.

854
00:46:39,449 --> 00:46:42,116
(water flowing)

855
00:46:43,985 --> 00:46:46,627
- [Mary] We're having friend, stop it!

856
00:46:46,627 --> 00:46:49,294
(alarm beeping)

857
00:46:51,564 --> 00:46:52,397
Stop it!

858
00:46:52,397 --> 00:46:53,349
- Get out of the way!

859
00:46:53,349 --> 00:46:54,182
Out of the way!

860
00:46:54,182 --> 00:46:55,015
Out of the way!

861
00:46:55,015 --> 00:46:56,064
Out of the way!

862
00:46:56,064 --> 00:46:58,241
(grunting)

863
00:46:58,241 --> 00:47:02,158
(water splashing and sizzling)

864
00:47:03,045 --> 00:47:06,587
(heavy breathing)

865
00:47:06,587 --> 00:47:09,420
(jacket flapping)

866
00:47:10,907 --> 00:47:13,795
(coughing)

867
00:47:13,795 --> 00:47:15,121
Where's Adam?

868
00:47:15,121 --> 00:47:16,944
- He's in the bud room, he had a migraine.

869
00:47:16,944 --> 00:47:18,998
- Oh god, I told you not
to put him down there!

870
00:47:18,998 --> 00:47:20,341
- Well it's the darkest room!

871
00:47:20,341 --> 00:47:21,563
- (mumbling) god!

872
00:47:21,563 --> 00:47:23,600
- I try to do everything right.

873
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,723
Shut up smoke detector!

874
00:47:25,723 --> 00:47:27,890
(banging)

875
00:47:29,323 --> 00:47:32,745
(suspenseful music)

876
00:47:32,745 --> 00:47:34,544
(heavy breathing)

877
00:47:34,544 --> 00:47:37,505
- Well, at least the smoke's going through

878
00:47:37,505 --> 00:47:38,440
the fucking hole in the roof.

879
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,560
- Brandon, I cannot take anymore

880
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,370
of this condescending tone of yours.

881
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:43,203
- I don't care.

882
00:47:43,203 --> 00:47:46,850
I feel like I've been in
crisis mode since I got here.

883
00:47:46,850 --> 00:47:48,490
- So, I started a fire.

884
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:50,210
I also helped you put it out.

885
00:47:51,105 --> 00:47:52,105
Give me some credit.

886
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:56,630
- Give me the pills.

887
00:47:56,630 --> 00:47:57,960
- What pills?

888
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,470
- I'm serious.

889
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:00,640
- Where's the pot?

890
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,473
- What pot?

891
00:48:02,363 --> 00:48:03,505
- Exactly.

892
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:05,290
- [Brandon] Why is there
still a hole in the roof?

893
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:08,790
- I call the roofers, your
father sends them home.

894
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:11,860
Everything go torn to
pieces in the art room.

895
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:14,890
He says why do you need a
room when you don't paint?

896
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:18,160
I say I'm trying to enhance my life.

897
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,670
I want to go to Spain.

898
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:20,970
Go to the Guggenheim.

899
00:48:22,026 --> 00:48:24,820
(mumbling) always on the computer.

900
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:28,130
I don't know, maybe I
should get another hobby.

901
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:29,710
Go on a cruise, yoga.

902
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:34,190
I hear there are classes with hot rocks

903
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:38,340
where everyone sweats and
you come out a new person.

904
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:39,970
That's what I want Brandon.

905
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,660
I want to come out a new person.

906
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:47,690
- Are you getting a divorce?

907
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:50,500
- Who knows?

908
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:53,350
First you have to find someone
before you can divorce'um.

909
00:48:55,297 --> 00:48:56,537
(grunting)

910
00:48:56,537 --> 00:48:57,870
- What the fuck.

911
00:49:01,033 --> 00:49:03,283
(grunting)

912
00:49:04,137 --> 00:49:05,431
(yelling)

913
00:49:05,431 --> 00:49:07,681
(exhaling)

914
00:49:17,031 --> 00:49:19,531
(cap popping)

915
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:27,940
- Fuck it I'm getting high.

916
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,671
- It's hard for me to watch you do that.

917
00:49:43,671 --> 00:49:44,673
- I don't care.

918
00:49:44,673 --> 00:49:46,090
It calms me down.

919
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:54,060
- Why didn't you tell your
friend you had a brother?

920
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:54,893
- I was going to.

921
00:49:54,893 --> 00:49:56,200
But when you hijacked my day.

922
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,810
- [Mary] You can be so secretive.

923
00:49:59,732 --> 00:50:00,650
I haven't met your girlfriend.

924
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:02,294
- [Brandon] And you will.

925
00:50:02,294 --> 00:50:03,127
(mumbling)

926
00:50:03,127 --> 00:50:03,960
- [Mary] I don't think
you've even told me her name.

927
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,590
- It's, ah, Mindy.

928
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:06,530
- Mindy?

929
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:07,620
Is she Jewish?

930
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:08,810
- No, is that a problem?

931
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:09,830
- As long as she makes you happy

932
00:50:09,830 --> 00:50:11,330
that's all that matters to me.

933
00:50:12,287 --> 00:50:14,870
(door banging)

934
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:19,183
- [Brandon] Dad?

935
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,984
- Brandon.

936
00:50:21,984 --> 00:50:22,987
- Where have you been?

937
00:50:22,987 --> 00:50:23,820
- I took Liebowitz for a walk.

938
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:26,864
- Mom says you've been gone for four days.

939
00:50:26,864 --> 00:50:27,697
- It was a long walk.

940
00:50:27,697 --> 00:50:28,530
- So where is he?

941
00:50:30,523 --> 00:50:31,900
- He got off the leash, the stupid animal.

942
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,040
- And you didn't try to look for him?

943
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,250
- I tried to find him, but my eyes.

944
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:36,800
- Mom says you've been driving.

945
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,660
- I drove him somewhere to take him

946
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:41,120
for a walk and then I walked home.

947
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,100
- Dicky?

948
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:42,960
- Yeah, what?

949
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,060
- So where's the car?

950
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:44,930
- Who can say?

951
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:45,763
- Dicky?

952
00:50:46,603 --> 00:50:47,627
- Yeah, what?

953
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:48,624
- We've been worrying about you.

954
00:50:48,624 --> 00:50:49,530
- Liebowitz needed some space.

955
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:51,290
- Liebowitz needed some space?

956
00:50:53,294 --> 00:50:55,544
(grunting)

957
00:50:57,910 --> 00:50:59,466
- [Mary] Sleep time.

958
00:50:59,466 --> 00:51:01,380
It'll be better.

959
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:03,760
- Dogs are very loyal to their masters,

960
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,660
but every once and a while they
have thoughts of their own.

961
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:11,200
Like they can't stand the
sight of bullshit anymore.

962
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:14,300
- Are you leaving her?

963
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:15,133
- Who said that?

964
00:51:15,133 --> 00:51:16,620
- Just answer the question.

965
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:19,860
- You don't walk back
into my life after a year

966
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:22,920
into this house, and tell me what to do.

967
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:23,753
- Richard.

968
00:51:23,753 --> 00:51:25,770
- Thought Brandon was coming tomorrow?

969
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:27,920
- Well he surprised us both.

970
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,500
- I come home, you're missing.

971
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,930
She's tearing up the whole house.

972
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:35,810
Humiliating me in front of my friend.

973
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:37,140
And you lost my dog.

974
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:41,710
I need you to at least act normal.

975
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:44,594
Or I am leaving.

976
00:51:44,594 --> 00:51:46,677
And I am not coming back.

977
00:51:48,216 --> 00:51:50,549
(screaming)

978
00:51:51,714 --> 00:51:52,547
- Travis.

979
00:51:53,554 --> 00:51:55,887
(screaming)

980
00:51:56,849 --> 00:51:59,349
(eerie music)

981
00:52:19,592 --> 00:52:21,759
(snoring)

982
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:25,830
(eerie music)

983
00:53:39,415 --> 00:53:41,665
(grunting)

984
00:53:44,517 --> 00:53:47,350
(phone vibrating)

985
00:53:49,479 --> 00:53:52,312
(phone vibrating)

986
00:53:53,677 --> 00:53:55,058
- [Brandon] Hello?

987
00:53:55,058 --> 00:53:56,221
- I've tried you three times.

988
00:53:56,221 --> 00:53:57,250
Why aren't you answering your phone?

989
00:53:57,250 --> 00:53:58,180
- I just woke up.

990
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:02,060
- How's it going?

991
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:03,490
- Good.

992
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:06,930
You know, just hanging with the folks.

993
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:10,710
- How's the weather up there?

994
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:11,543
- Nice.

995
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:13,910
The sun's out.

996
00:54:16,077 --> 00:54:16,910
(cat growling)

997
00:54:16,910 --> 00:54:18,110
- Stop is Sebastian.

998
00:54:19,551 --> 00:54:21,020
I don't know what to do.

999
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:23,000
Sebastian's freaking out.

1000
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,480
- Well, because he knows
you're cutting off his manhood.

1001
00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:28,390
- What's that supposed to mean?

1002
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:30,030
- Nothing.

1003
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:32,780
Just trying to be funny.

1004
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:33,710
- Ha ha.

1005
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:34,940
You failed.

1006
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:36,690
- Well, wouldn't be the first time.

1007
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:41,210
- I feel like you're
hiding something from me.

1008
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,777
- No.

1009
00:54:44,777 --> 00:54:47,100
I'm not hiding anything from you.

1010
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:50,250
- See look, I'm just trying
to take care of our cat okay?

1011
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:53,480
On my own, without you,
because you had to go

1012
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:56,590
to your folks for some
reason, which makes me feel

1013
00:54:56,590 --> 00:54:58,190
like you're ashamed of
bringing me or something.

1014
00:54:58,190 --> 00:55:00,550
- You know what, that could literally not

1015
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:03,180
be more of the opposite
of what's happening.

1016
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:04,120
- If you say so.

1017
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:07,970
Why wasn't I invited?

1018
00:55:09,077 --> 00:55:13,830
- You know what, I have a
pretty good reason for that,

1019
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:15,990
which you will find out about shortly.

1020
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:16,823
- Mm hm.

1021
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:19,670
Did you tell Adam about Travis yet?

1022
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:22,400
- No, I'm waiting for a good time.

1023
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:26,000
- You cannot be serious.

1024
00:55:27,310 --> 00:55:28,500
- You know what, he just got up

1025
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,050
so I'm gonna have to call you back.

1026
00:55:30,050 --> 00:55:31,820
- Seriously, you're gonna have

1027
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:33,620
to learn how to deal with adversity.

1028
00:55:35,016 --> 00:55:35,849
(clicking)

1029
00:55:35,849 --> 00:55:36,682
Hello?

1030
00:55:41,098 --> 00:55:43,265
(sighing)

1031
00:55:48,075 --> 00:55:48,908
- [Brandon] I heard you had a migraine.

1032
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:50,603
- Yeah.

1033
00:55:52,673 --> 00:55:53,506
It was pretty bad.

1034
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:55,839
You know?

1035
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:57,200
Your mom gave me these sweats so.

1036
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,531
- Yeah.

1037
00:55:58,531 --> 00:55:59,364
(chuckling)

1038
00:55:59,364 --> 00:56:00,197
I was wondering where those came from.

1039
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:04,000
- Last night sounded like
you were in a situation.

1040
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:04,833
- Oh, yeah.

1041
00:56:05,823 --> 00:56:06,680
I was.

1042
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,250
But it's better now.

1043
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:09,140
- Is it?

1044
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:10,620
- Yeah, my dad came back so.

1045
00:56:11,722 --> 00:56:12,555
- Oh he's back?

1046
00:56:12,555 --> 00:56:13,388
- Yup.

1047
00:56:13,388 --> 00:56:14,400
- That's good, where was he?

1048
00:56:15,890 --> 00:56:19,390
- Apparently he lost our dog and his car.

1049
00:56:19,390 --> 00:56:22,710
And then there's three
days unaccounted for.

1050
00:56:24,282 --> 00:56:26,532
(laughing)

1051
00:56:27,696 --> 00:56:29,196
But now he's back.

1052
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,230
- Well at least he's safe.

1053
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:36,980
- Um, I am so sorry I
dragged you into this.

1054
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:38,620
- Yeah, about that it's--

1055
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:41,230
- As soon as I get this
right, we are out of here.

1056
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:43,770
- No, I mean, it's
understandable that your

1057
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:45,920
mom is having a hard time with everything

1058
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,370
that you guys have been,
you know, going through.

1059
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:53,110
- She told you about Travis?

1060
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:55,260
- Why didn't you tell me?

1061
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:00,290
- Am I interrupting?

1062
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:01,340
- No, no, come on in.

1063
00:57:09,841 --> 00:57:12,091
(grunting)

1064
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:26,270
- Would you mind giving me a hand?

1065
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:27,690
There's a few more out in the car.

1066
00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:30,263
- Oh yeah.

1067
00:57:31,878 --> 00:57:32,711
No, no, I got it.

1068
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:40,410
- So how's the head?

1069
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:42,980
- Better, thanks for asking.

1070
00:58:37,913 --> 00:58:40,746
(leaves rattling)

1071
00:58:42,224 --> 00:58:45,057
(emotional music)

1072
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:55,873
- Well,

1073
00:58:57,290 --> 00:58:59,440
yeah that was pretty embarrassing.

1074
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,150
I have never been dragged out of a

1075
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:02,900
restaurant by a grown woman before.

1076
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:07,980
- My manager felt bad.

1077
00:59:08,990 --> 00:59:11,800
Said to give you a
coupon for a free shake.

1078
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:14,380
Redeemable anytime after five.

1079
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:15,213
- Awesome.

1080
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:20,980
So, um, you're in a band?

1081
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:23,010
- Why you play?

1082
00:59:23,010 --> 00:59:23,843
- No.

1083
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:25,673
Well,

1084
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:27,713
the oboe.

1085
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:30,390
When I was seven they said choose

1086
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:32,090
an instrument so I chose the oboe.

1087
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:35,880
But I couldn't handle the pressure.

1088
00:59:37,238 --> 00:59:38,150
I was a bad oboe player.

1089
00:59:40,298 --> 00:59:41,910
So that was my nickname, Oboe.

1090
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:43,290
Am I still talking right now?

1091
00:59:45,862 --> 00:59:50,090
I should have to stop.

1092
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:52,970
I don't know, maybe that's why
I'm attracted to musicians.

1093
00:59:52,970 --> 00:59:53,803
- Is that right?

1094
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:56,930
- Oh, I didn't.

1095
00:59:56,930 --> 00:59:57,870
I didn't um.

1096
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:01,650
I'm not saying that I'm
attracted to you in particular.

1097
01:00:01,650 --> 01:00:03,200
It's just more of.

1098
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,950
- Just attracted to people like me.

1099
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:07,043
In general.

1100
01:00:13,790 --> 01:00:15,040
- Mm, peanut butter cups.

1101
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:21,770
Mm mm.

1102
01:00:21,770 --> 01:00:23,940
Mm, that is really old.

1103
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:24,773
Like super old.

1104
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:26,670
- Are you surprised?

1105
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:30,710
- You've seen me at my worst.

1106
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:33,950
Lot of lows here.

1107
01:00:34,834 --> 01:00:36,501
- It's quite a look.

1108
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:40,886
- [Brandon] Hey, how
much food did you get?

1109
01:00:40,886 --> 01:00:42,550
- Big dinner tonight.

1110
01:00:42,550 --> 01:00:43,383
- What's the occasion?

1111
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:45,730
- I'm looking at it.

1112
01:00:48,790 --> 01:00:49,900
- Ah, thanks for the coupon.

1113
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:50,850
- Don't mention it.

1114
01:00:54,710 --> 01:00:55,543
- Dude.

1115
01:00:55,543 --> 01:00:56,376
- What?

1116
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:58,980
- You're trying to hit on Craigslist girl?

1117
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:00,593
- Stop it.

1118
01:01:00,593 --> 01:01:01,426
(mumbling)

1119
01:01:01,426 --> 01:01:02,259
No.

1120
01:01:06,470 --> 01:01:07,840
- Really?

1121
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:08,673
Hmm.

1122
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:11,850
- 'Cause it kind of looks like
you're trying to hit that.

1123
01:01:11,850 --> 01:01:13,630
- I'm not trying to hit Craigslist girl.

1124
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:14,580
- I don't blame you.

1125
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:15,860
I mean, her body is

1126
01:01:18,090 --> 01:01:18,923
smoking.

1127
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,670
- No smoking in the house.

1128
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:25,680
- No one's smoking Dad.

1129
01:01:26,730 --> 01:01:27,680
- This is your dad.

1130
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:30,820
- Have you seen my tablet?

1131
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,740
- Why would I have seen your tablet?

1132
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:36,820
- Maybe you took it.

1133
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:39,020
- I didn't take your tablet.

1134
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:40,410
- Maybe your friend took it.

1135
01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:41,650
- My friend didn't take your tablet.

1136
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:43,020
- Yeah, I didn't take your tablet.

1137
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:49,370
- How do you know he didn't take it?

1138
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:50,680
- Oh shit.

1139
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:51,560
Yuan's blowing me up.

1140
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:52,460
I gotta take this.

1141
01:01:54,790 --> 01:01:56,010
- He's always on the phone.

1142
01:01:57,930 --> 01:01:59,030
- It's his girlfriend.

1143
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:02,910
- Hmm.

1144
01:02:02,910 --> 01:02:03,743
I knew that.

1145
01:02:07,210 --> 01:02:09,340
- I think they're fighting.

1146
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:12,080
- He doesn't share that
kind of thing with me.

1147
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,860
- I don't think it's personal.

1148
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:15,730
- Well I'm his father.

1149
01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:16,940
Everything's personal.

1150
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:19,773
- Hey,

1151
01:02:24,410 --> 01:02:27,090
Gotta pro-pone-it-ose-dis-cose.

1152
01:02:27,090 --> 01:02:29,810
(laughing)

1153
01:02:29,810 --> 01:02:30,643
Mm.

1154
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:34,950
There she is.

1155
01:02:41,810 --> 01:02:42,643
- Tablet.

1156
01:02:55,853 --> 01:02:58,835
(thundering)

1157
01:02:58,835 --> 01:03:00,220
- What brings you to town?

1158
01:03:00,220 --> 01:03:02,210
- Just taking a break from New York.

1159
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:03,900
- A break huh?

1160
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:05,020
- Yeah, you know.

1161
01:03:06,050 --> 01:03:08,240
- No I don't, that's why I'm asking you.

1162
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:12,790
- I was living with my girlfriend

1163
01:03:12,790 --> 01:03:14,900
and we broke up, so now I'm not.

1164
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:18,660
And I'm working on a graphic novel.

1165
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:20,440
- So you're in transition.

1166
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:24,693
- Yeah.

1167
01:03:24,693 --> 01:03:26,230
- Isn't that life?

1168
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:27,790
A series of transitions.

1169
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:30,080
- I hope not.

1170
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:31,830
- Don't let a breakup get you down.

1171
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:36,330
Through all adversary or obstacles,

1172
01:03:36,330 --> 01:03:39,240
there is a seed of greater benefit.

1173
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:42,280
That's Napoleon.

1174
01:03:44,025 --> 01:03:45,120
A personal hero of mine.

1175
01:03:46,253 --> 01:03:48,929
- You must have a great capacity
to see the best in people.

1176
01:03:48,929 --> 01:03:49,930
(thundering)

1177
01:03:49,930 --> 01:03:50,763
- I do.

1178
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:53,860
I came up with a story about that.

1179
01:03:56,190 --> 01:03:57,190
There's this father.

1180
01:03:59,434 --> 01:04:01,070
He's a standup guy.

1181
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:02,480
He's a mechanical engineer.

1182
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:03,730
People like him.

1183
01:04:03,730 --> 01:04:05,650
He has two sons.

1184
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:08,650
He gives everything to the
youngest son and he squanders it.

1185
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:12,080
Everybody thought he's never coming back,

1186
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:14,109
but he did return.

1187
01:04:14,109 --> 01:04:17,280
And the father was just
so happy to see him again.

1188
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:20,870
Oh my, you could see the
happiness in his eyes.

1189
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:26,730
He loved his son so much
he forgot the squandering.

1190
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:28,090
And the older said, are you gonna

1191
01:04:28,090 --> 01:04:29,650
forgive him for what he did?

1192
01:04:30,910 --> 01:04:34,830
And the father was just
so happy that he was home

1193
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:38,530
and he loved him so much, he said I have

1194
01:04:38,530 --> 01:04:41,630
two sons and I love'um both.

1195
01:04:44,486 --> 01:04:45,320
The end.

1196
01:04:46,707 --> 01:04:49,124
(thundering)

1197
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,770
- Isn't that the story
of the Prodigal Son?

1198
01:04:52,770 --> 01:04:53,603
- I made it up.

1199
01:04:57,608 --> 01:04:58,880
- I think it's the story
of the Prodigal Son.

1200
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,140
- No it's my story I made it up.

1201
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:02,030
I thought you'd appreciate it.

1202
01:05:02,030 --> 01:05:03,485
- No I do.

1203
01:05:03,485 --> 01:05:04,318
But I'm pretty sure
you just took the story

1204
01:05:04,318 --> 01:05:05,910
of the Prodigal Son and
you put yourself in it.

1205
01:05:05,910 --> 01:05:06,820
- I made it up!

1206
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:08,870
It's my story.

1207
01:05:08,870 --> 01:05:09,703
Mine.

1208
01:05:12,890 --> 01:05:15,450
Ah fuck it, maybe you're right.

1209
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:17,789
It's a lot like the Prodigal Son.

1210
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:18,622
(laughing)

1211
01:05:18,622 --> 01:05:20,840
- For the love of god,
why are you yelling?

1212
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:24,410
- I'm having a conversation
with Brandon's friend.

1213
01:05:24,410 --> 01:05:28,420
- Oh, goodness, Adam you're alive.

1214
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:30,260
You should've seen him last night.

1215
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:34,460
Cooing like a baby
animal lost in the wood.

1216
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:35,810
No milk.

1217
01:05:35,810 --> 01:05:37,090
No tite to suck.

1218
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:41,213
- I get migraines, but I'm okay now.

1219
01:05:41,213 --> 01:05:43,650
- (mumbling) fucking shit.

1220
01:05:43,650 --> 01:05:45,310
- [Mary] Brandon what's wrong?

1221
01:05:45,310 --> 01:05:46,180
- Nothing.

1222
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:47,350
Everything's great.

1223
01:05:47,350 --> 01:05:48,790
- He's fighting with his girlfriend.

1224
01:05:48,790 --> 01:05:50,290
- What?

1225
01:05:50,290 --> 01:05:51,320
Who told you that?

1226
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:53,170
- Everything okay with Yuan?

1227
01:05:53,170 --> 01:05:54,640
- Yuan?

1228
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,230
Who's Yuan?

1229
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:58,730
- Your girlfriend's name is Yuan?

1230
01:05:58,730 --> 01:06:00,520
- I thought it was Mindy.

1231
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:03,840
- Well Yuan is her Chinese name.

1232
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:06,060
- Your girlfriend is Asian?

1233
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:08,270
- She's Chinese American.

1234
01:06:08,270 --> 01:06:11,500
- Why would you say her
name was Mindy if it's Yuan?

1235
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,450
- Trust me, you don't
wanna fight with an Asian.

1236
01:06:13,450 --> 01:06:14,680
- We're not fighting.

1237
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:17,330
- [Dicky] Good, because you won't win.

1238
01:06:17,330 --> 01:06:18,163
- She's just,

1239
01:06:19,290 --> 01:06:21,380
she has to neuter a cat.

1240
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:22,240
- Herself?

1241
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:23,870
- No, she took it to the vet.

1242
01:06:23,870 --> 01:06:26,110
- Brandon, why are you
fighting over a cat?

1243
01:06:26,110 --> 01:06:27,550
- We're not fighting.

1244
01:06:28,573 --> 01:06:33,380
- You know in the Chinese
culture, a cat represents pussies.

1245
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:34,430
- [Mary] Dicky!

1246
01:06:34,430 --> 01:06:35,869
- It's a fact.

1247
01:06:35,869 --> 01:06:36,872
(grunting)

1248
01:06:36,872 --> 01:06:39,230
- Can you please stop
disrespecting Asians?

1249
01:06:39,230 --> 01:06:40,709
- Are you kidding?

1250
01:06:40,709 --> 01:06:41,709
I love Asians.

1251
01:06:41,709 --> 01:06:42,730
They have a great work ethic.

1252
01:06:42,730 --> 01:06:44,280
They don't even have to cook their fish.

1253
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:46,980
- Look what you're doing to him.

1254
01:06:49,970 --> 01:06:51,890
What is it Brandon?

1255
01:06:51,890 --> 01:06:53,110
(grunting)

1256
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:55,010
You look like you're going to explode.

1257
01:06:58,570 --> 01:06:59,403
- I'm fine.

1258
01:07:03,636 --> 01:07:06,060
I just wanna have a nice
dinner tonight is all.

1259
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:10,250
- I hate how everybody
holds everything in.

1260
01:07:10,250 --> 01:07:13,670
If you have something to say then say it.

1261
01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:15,060
- Why'd you throw away Hoppy?

1262
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:15,893
- I would never,

1263
01:07:17,050 --> 01:07:19,010
never throw away your rabbit Brandon.

1264
01:07:19,010 --> 01:07:21,230
- Well you should, because the dog

1265
01:07:21,230 --> 01:07:23,250
has been humping it so much (chuckling)

1266
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:25,190
that it's like a freaking cum rag.

1267
01:07:25,190 --> 01:07:27,410
- Whatever is going on, we'll all

1268
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:30,350
talk about it at dinner like a family.

1269
01:07:30,350 --> 01:07:32,960
Because that's what families do.

1270
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,860
And we're going to celebrate your friend.

1271
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:35,820
The poor thing.

1272
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:38,730
It's the least I can do
after what he's been through.

1273
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:40,713
Come on.

1274
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:44,410
It's going to be better Brandon.

1275
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:46,960
It's going to be better.

1276
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:49,273
See?

1277
01:07:56,020 --> 01:07:57,610
It's better.

1278
01:07:57,610 --> 01:07:58,650
Can't you feel it?

1279
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:01,550
- Come on let's get you outta here.

1280
01:08:02,712 --> 01:08:03,810
- Ah, I'm good.

1281
01:08:03,810 --> 01:08:07,596
- Trust me, it's only
gonna get worse from here.

1282
01:08:07,596 --> 01:08:09,429
- How can I help Mary?

1283
01:08:15,478 --> 01:08:17,958
- Dinner is going to be tasty.

1284
01:08:17,958 --> 01:08:20,375
(soft music)

1285
01:08:49,238 --> 01:08:50,071
(sighing)

1286
01:08:50,071 --> 01:08:51,770
- Well that was delicious.

1287
01:08:51,770 --> 01:08:53,700
- Yeah, thanks Mom.

1288
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:55,320
Wasn't that good Dad?

1289
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:56,610
- What?

1290
01:08:56,610 --> 01:08:57,443
- Mom's brisket.

1291
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:01,290
- I have something in my shoe.

1292
01:09:01,290 --> 01:09:04,140
- Thank you Dicky, I'm glad you liked it.

1293
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,557
(soft music)

1294
01:09:08,518 --> 01:09:09,370
- Let me give you a hand.

1295
01:09:09,370 --> 01:09:10,880
- Oh no, you just sit Travis.

1296
01:09:15,175 --> 01:09:16,690
- It's Adam.

1297
01:09:16,690 --> 01:09:18,090
- Oh, did I?

1298
01:09:18,090 --> 01:09:19,910
- She always does this.

1299
01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:21,220
- I do not.

1300
01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:23,520
- Yes, you always are
just mixing up names.

1301
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:24,560
You used to call me Dicky,

1302
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:27,558
the dog Brandon, and Dad Liebowitz.

1303
01:09:27,558 --> 01:09:28,391
(laughing)

1304
01:09:28,391 --> 01:09:29,260
- Liebowitz, that's the dog right?

1305
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:31,158
Whatever happened to him?

1306
01:09:31,158 --> 01:09:33,670
- Brisket was very good.

1307
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:34,503
Thank you.

1308
01:09:37,290 --> 01:09:38,440
- [Brandon] By the way,

1309
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:40,733
Yuan says hello.

1310
01:09:41,921 --> 01:09:43,250
- Well, I'll drink to that.

1311
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:45,970
- She's very much looking
forward to meeting you both.

1312
01:09:45,970 --> 01:09:48,040
- Well, you really like Yuan?

1313
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:50,173
- I do.

1314
01:09:51,330 --> 01:09:52,230
We're very happy.

1315
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:54,710
- Well, not right now.

1316
01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:55,543
- Richard.

1317
01:09:55,543 --> 01:09:56,700
- I'm just stating a fact.

1318
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:58,290
They're not getting along.

1319
01:09:58,290 --> 01:09:59,850
- Thank you for highlighting that.

1320
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:01,100
- I'll get the apple pie.

1321
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:03,310
- Mm, great.

1322
01:10:03,310 --> 01:10:05,240
- Adam, would you like some pie?

1323
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:06,900
- You know what, I think I'm good.

1324
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:09,276
I feel like I've gained 100
pounds since I've been here.

1325
01:10:09,276 --> 01:10:10,278
(chuckling)

1326
01:10:10,278 --> 01:10:11,670
- Oh no, no, eat, eat.

1327
01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:12,620
You have to.

1328
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:15,080
- You know, this is like
a real family dinner.

1329
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:17,280
I've got my wife.

1330
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:19,590
I've got Brandon.

1331
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:22,110
I've got Craigslist.

1332
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:28,177
And you.

1333
01:10:28,177 --> 01:10:31,260
You're like,

1334
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:32,320
you're like um.

1335
01:10:39,455 --> 01:10:40,860
(knocking)

1336
01:10:40,860 --> 01:10:43,150
- Brandon don't you
have some news to share?

1337
01:10:43,150 --> 01:10:46,020
- Yes Brandon, what is this news

1338
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:47,670
we've been waiting to hear about?

1339
01:10:51,238 --> 01:10:52,071
(throat clearing)

1340
01:10:52,071 --> 01:10:53,271
- Okay.

1341
01:10:53,271 --> 01:10:55,978
(clanking)

1342
01:10:55,978 --> 01:10:57,710
(exhaling)

1343
01:10:57,710 --> 01:10:58,543
Mom,

1344
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:00,823
Dad,

1345
01:11:01,870 --> 01:11:04,070
As you know um,

1346
01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:07,690
Yuan and I have been dating
for about a year now.

1347
01:11:07,690 --> 01:11:08,523
And um,

1348
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:14,340
but in these last few months something

1349
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:16,780
has become very apparent to me.

1350
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:18,080
- She's a man?

1351
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:18,970
- No.

1352
01:11:18,970 --> 01:11:21,000
- I saw it on 60 Minutes.

1353
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,150
She said she's a woman,
but there's a penis.

1354
01:11:24,150 --> 01:11:24,983
- Richard.

1355
01:11:24,983 --> 01:11:25,970
- I don't judge.

1356
01:11:25,970 --> 01:11:27,120
Love is love.

1357
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:29,560
- Brandon is trying to tell us something.

1358
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:31,710
- Yes, what I was trying to say

1359
01:11:31,710 --> 01:11:33,800
before I was so rudely
interrupted was that

1360
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:38,252
I've decided to ask Yuan to be my wife.

1361
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:41,085
(emotional music)

1362
01:11:52,650 --> 01:11:53,880
- Wow, that's

1363
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:57,695
Brandon.

1364
01:11:57,695 --> 01:12:00,130
(laughing)

1365
01:12:00,130 --> 01:12:02,930
- Yeah, um, and with your
permission of course,

1366
01:12:02,930 --> 01:12:04,020
I'd like to,

1367
01:12:05,612 --> 01:12:07,430
well I'd like to give
her Grandma Roda's ring.

1368
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:12,316
- You mean the one she brought
from Berlin in her anus?

1369
01:12:12,316 --> 01:12:15,066
(items clanking)

1370
01:12:17,093 --> 01:12:19,160
- [Piper] Sorry.

1371
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:21,130
- I was unaware of that part of the story.

1372
01:12:21,130 --> 01:12:23,250
- That's why she didn't wear it anymore.

1373
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:25,490
- I don't understand.

1374
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:29,130
- Well next weekend, we
are going wine tasting.

1375
01:12:29,130 --> 01:12:31,170
And I've got a room at the Rhine Cliff.

1376
01:12:31,170 --> 01:12:33,460
And a table at the Culinary Institute.

1377
01:12:33,460 --> 01:12:36,320
And all I need is the ring.

1378
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:40,750
- Just so I'm clear, you're asking me

1379
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:43,850
to give Roda's ring to
a girl I've never met?

1380
01:12:43,850 --> 01:12:45,040
- No (laughing) Mom.

1381
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:47,375
I give her the ring Mom.

1382
01:12:47,375 --> 01:12:48,337
(laughing)

1383
01:12:48,337 --> 01:12:49,720
- But what if she sells it?

1384
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:51,128
- [Brandon] What?

1385
01:12:51,128 --> 01:12:51,980
She's not gonna sell Roda's ring.

1386
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:53,170
- [Mary] How do you know?

1387
01:12:53,170 --> 01:12:56,161
- [Brandon] Because,
I mean, she has money.

1388
01:12:56,161 --> 01:12:57,560
(laughing)

1389
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:00,180
- That's what this is all about.

1390
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:01,601
- No.

1391
01:13:01,601 --> 01:13:02,599
What?

1392
01:13:02,599 --> 01:13:03,440
Come on, no, that's not what this is.

1393
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:04,810
- If she has so much money why

1394
01:13:04,810 --> 01:13:07,020
doesn't she buy her own damn ring?

1395
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:08,510
(laughing)

1396
01:13:08,510 --> 01:13:10,420
- You realize that this
is about you right?

1397
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:12,510
I mean, this is including you.

1398
01:13:12,510 --> 01:13:16,870
- You want to include me
by giving away my ring?

1399
01:13:16,870 --> 01:13:19,650
- [Brandon] No by
keeping it in our family.

1400
01:13:19,650 --> 01:13:22,020
- [Mary] But it's going to someone else.

1401
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:22,890
- No to Yuan.

1402
01:13:23,950 --> 01:13:24,800
My fiance.

1403
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,830
My potential future wife.

1404
01:13:26,830 --> 01:13:28,030
- I get it.

1405
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:31,190
This family isn't good enough.

1406
01:13:31,190 --> 01:13:33,121
You want to join another one.

1407
01:13:33,121 --> 01:13:34,050
- My god.

1408
01:13:34,937 --> 01:13:37,280
Dad aren't you gonna say anything?

1409
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:41,550
- The Yuan Dynasty was very
common to the Chinese people.

1410
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:42,990
- Okay, fuck this.

1411
01:13:43,997 --> 01:13:45,690
(grunting)

1412
01:13:45,690 --> 01:13:46,550
- Dicky.

1413
01:13:46,550 --> 01:13:48,930
- You're marrying a Yuan.

1414
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:50,300
You want the calm.

1415
01:13:51,830 --> 01:13:52,980
You want the stability.

1416
01:13:55,460 --> 01:13:57,750
- [Brandon] Oh my god!

1417
01:13:57,750 --> 01:14:00,470
- Will you put on your pants?

1418
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:02,510
- [Dicky] This is my home.

1419
01:14:02,510 --> 01:14:04,000
- [Mary] These are our guests.

1420
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,270
- [Dicky] I'm sure the
guests would like to

1421
01:14:05,270 --> 01:14:06,750
be comfortable in their house.

1422
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:09,070
This one doesn't even have a home.

1423
01:14:09,070 --> 01:14:09,903
- Excuse me.

1424
01:14:10,970 --> 01:14:12,160
- He's a homeless.

1425
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:14,450
- He is not a homeless.

1426
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:16,030
He just broke up with his girlfriend

1427
01:14:16,030 --> 01:14:18,450
and he's looking for a new home.

1428
01:14:18,450 --> 01:14:19,283
Do you get the distinction?

1429
01:14:19,283 --> 01:14:22,480
And another thing, where is my dog?

1430
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:24,220
- Oh don't be melodramatic.

1431
01:14:24,220 --> 01:14:25,420
- God.

1432
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:26,253
No one cares.

1433
01:14:26,253 --> 01:14:27,874
No one cares.

1434
01:14:27,874 --> 01:14:28,929
None of you care.

1435
01:14:28,929 --> 01:14:29,762
- I care about his peeing.

1436
01:14:36,330 --> 01:14:37,992
- [Adam] Hey.

1437
01:14:37,992 --> 01:14:38,825
- Hey.

1438
01:14:41,832 --> 01:14:42,665
- Where were you rushing off to?

1439
01:14:42,665 --> 01:14:44,150
- I have some things to do why?

1440
01:14:45,542 --> 01:14:46,470
- Can I join you?

1441
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:50,140
- Yeah I would but tonight's no good.

1442
01:14:50,980 --> 01:14:52,630
- Totally.

1443
01:14:52,630 --> 01:14:53,463
- Tomorrow?

1444
01:14:54,370 --> 01:14:55,367
(sighing)

1445
01:14:55,367 --> 01:14:56,482
- Tomorrow we're outta here.

1446
01:14:56,482 --> 01:14:57,470
As soon as Brandon gets that ring.

1447
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:02,410
I guess I'll just go back inside.

1448
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:07,413
- Come with me.

1449
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:09,173
- Yeah?

1450
01:15:09,173 --> 01:15:11,720
- Offer expires in three, two.

1451
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:12,553
- Yeah.

1452
01:15:13,906 --> 01:15:15,527
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1453
01:15:15,527 --> 01:15:16,360
One.

1454
01:15:17,654 --> 01:15:20,071
(soft music)

1455
01:15:39,746 --> 01:15:40,663
This'll do.

1456
01:15:43,944 --> 01:15:46,111
(sighing)

1457
01:15:46,984 --> 01:15:50,120
(soft music)

1458
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:52,420
So how long have you
worked for Brandon's mom?

1459
01:15:53,570 --> 01:15:54,850
- [Piper] About two months now.

1460
01:15:57,090 --> 01:15:59,110
I'm trying to save money for school.

1461
01:16:00,050 --> 01:16:01,840
And my mom is in a tough spot, so.

1462
01:16:06,104 --> 01:16:07,760
- What's up with your mom?

1463
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:08,960
- She has breast cancer.

1464
01:16:17,645 --> 01:16:18,478
- I'm sorry.

1465
01:16:19,643 --> 01:16:21,200
That sucks.

1466
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:23,410
- She had me when she was 19.

1467
01:16:23,410 --> 01:16:24,970
It's kind of too young to die.

1468
01:16:32,604 --> 01:16:33,690
- Well that's big of you helping her out.

1469
01:16:36,540 --> 01:16:38,250
- You're not cool with your parents?

1470
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:42,810
- My parents are,

1471
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:46,700
they're like this light
switch that will never on

1472
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:49,501
no matter how many times
you try to flip that switch.

1473
01:16:49,501 --> 01:16:50,334
There's,

1474
01:16:51,602 --> 01:16:52,435
there's just no light.

1475
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:56,880
- So at some point, why keep trying?

1476
01:17:00,461 --> 01:17:02,320
- I don't know.

1477
01:17:11,310 --> 01:17:15,900
Someone should really fix
that hole in the roof.

1478
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:18,040
- Look, I know you mean well,

1479
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:19,940
but you do not want to mess with that.

1480
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:21,873
- Why not?

1481
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:24,940
- You really don't know.

1482
01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:27,653
- Know what?

1483
01:17:27,653 --> 01:17:28,990
- What happened to Travis.

1484
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,790
Apparently, his dad forced
him to install solar panels.

1485
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,860
But he was like really overweight

1486
01:17:41,860 --> 01:17:46,630
and he went out, he
stepped on a rotting patch.

1487
01:17:51,325 --> 01:17:52,510
- Wait is that how he--

1488
01:17:52,510 --> 01:17:53,470
- Well no.

1489
01:17:53,470 --> 01:17:55,054
I mean, no.

1490
01:17:55,054 --> 01:17:56,200
(chuckling)

1491
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:57,033
But after that

1492
01:17:59,710 --> 01:18:01,210
he ODed on painkillers.

1493
01:18:07,915 --> 01:18:08,748
(exhaling)

1494
01:18:08,748 --> 01:18:10,400
- How old was he?

1495
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:11,233
- 25.

1496
01:18:13,190 --> 01:18:15,090
- So he was like a full-sledged adult.

1497
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:18,490
- I,

1498
01:18:18,490 --> 01:18:19,940
I wouldn't call him an adult.

1499
01:18:21,774 --> 01:18:23,760
- Well he was old enough to be an adult.

1500
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:25,780
- Age doesn't make someone an adult.

1501
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:28,500
- Well what makes someone an adult?

1502
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:32,760
- Maybe when you finally
learn who your parents

1503
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:35,030
are but you love them anyway.

1504
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:43,833
- Okay.

1505
01:18:51,070 --> 01:18:52,374
Are you an adult?

1506
01:18:52,374 --> 01:18:53,207
(laughing)

1507
01:18:53,207 --> 01:18:54,626
- No.

1508
01:18:54,626 --> 01:18:55,459
(laughing)

1509
01:18:55,459 --> 01:18:56,292
- Okay.

1510
01:18:56,292 --> 01:18:57,470
- Oh.

1511
01:18:57,470 --> 01:18:58,303
You?

1512
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:01,280
- [Adam] Judging by your definition,

1513
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:04,020
I don't know if I am.

1514
01:19:07,790 --> 01:19:09,150
- [Piper] We'll get there one day.

1515
01:19:11,370 --> 01:19:12,260
- [Adam] Hopefully.

1516
01:19:16,324 --> 01:19:18,762
(kissing)

1517
01:19:18,762 --> 01:19:19,612
- God, I'm sorry.

1518
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:23,470
I just can't do this.

1519
01:19:23,470 --> 01:19:24,303
- Beer breathe?

1520
01:19:24,303 --> 01:19:25,136
- No.

1521
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:26,933
You're fine.

1522
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:31,310
You're just doing what everybody does.

1523
01:19:31,310 --> 01:19:32,143
- Which is what?

1524
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:37,270
- You have an empty space
that you need to fill.

1525
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:42,753
(emotional music)

1526
01:19:59,020 --> 01:19:59,853
- Okay.

1527
01:19:59,853 --> 01:20:00,840
So if you didn't bring me up here

1528
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:02,240
for this, what are we doing?

1529
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:07,073
(emotional music)

1530
01:20:11,941 --> 01:20:13,780
- I can't go back into that house again.

1531
01:20:15,830 --> 01:20:17,420
School is so damn expensive.

1532
01:20:17,420 --> 01:20:20,120
And with my mom I...

1533
01:20:23,883 --> 01:20:26,339
(sighing)

1534
01:20:26,339 --> 01:20:28,930
(emotional music)

1535
01:20:28,930 --> 01:20:30,080
I was going to sell it.

1536
01:20:34,450 --> 01:20:38,110
But I don't think that I can
actually go through with it.

1537
01:20:43,702 --> 01:20:45,108
- Is that the wedding ring?

1538
01:20:45,108 --> 01:20:47,530
(emotional music)

1539
01:20:47,530 --> 01:20:49,680
- I found it in the
left owl on the mantle.

1540
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:54,791
Could you put it back for me?

1541
01:20:54,791 --> 01:20:57,624
(emotional music)

1542
01:21:30,412 --> 01:21:31,245
- [Mary] I can't believe
you feel more at home

1543
01:21:31,245 --> 01:21:34,870
in an Asian family than
you do in your own home.

1544
01:21:34,870 --> 01:21:36,790
- Maybe it's that eastern influence Mom.

1545
01:21:36,790 --> 01:21:38,060
- That's not funny.

1546
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:39,980
There was never an eastern influence here.

1547
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:42,570
We brought you up American.

1548
01:21:42,570 --> 01:21:43,850
In an American home.

1549
01:21:43,850 --> 01:21:45,191
In an American way.

1550
01:21:45,191 --> 01:21:48,020
- I feel so patriotic
when I'm with you guys.

1551
01:21:48,020 --> 01:21:50,720
- After eating my brisket, and enjoying it

1552
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:53,070
the way you did, how could you possibly

1553
01:21:53,070 --> 01:21:56,391
spend your life eating Asian food?

1554
01:21:56,391 --> 01:21:58,450
- Do you know how
uncomfortable you make me?

1555
01:21:58,450 --> 01:21:59,622
Do you feel underappreciated?

1556
01:21:59,622 --> 01:22:01,222
- [Mary] (mumbling) accusations.

1557
01:22:02,367 --> 01:22:04,405
- [Brandon] I'm not
making accusations at all.

1558
01:22:04,405 --> 01:22:05,925
- You said I was drinking too much.

1559
01:22:05,925 --> 01:22:06,826
- [Brandon] Mom you're drunk.

1560
01:22:06,826 --> 01:22:07,659
- I am not.

1561
01:22:07,659 --> 01:22:08,530
- [Brandon] Mom you're drunk.

1562
01:22:08,530 --> 01:22:09,363
You're drunk, you're drunk.

1563
01:22:09,363 --> 01:22:10,196
- I am not drunk.

1564
01:22:10,196 --> 01:22:11,400
I have not had a lot to drink.

1565
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:12,700
I have had a reasonable amount.

1566
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:14,970
- That's a new bottle of
vodka you cracked Mom.

1567
01:22:14,970 --> 01:22:16,864
Don't you think you've had enough?

1568
01:22:16,864 --> 01:22:17,697
- It's a new bottle that's
it, it's a new bottle.

1569
01:22:17,697 --> 01:22:20,260
- It's a new bottle for after dinner.

1570
01:22:20,260 --> 01:22:23,020
- Well, I needed it after dinner.

1571
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:24,960
After the treatment I received.

1572
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:27,250
I didn't get any
appreciation for my cooking.

1573
01:22:27,250 --> 01:22:28,083
- Mom we said thank you.

1574
01:22:28,083 --> 01:22:29,760
We loved the brisket.

1575
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,593
- We loved your brisket.

1576
01:22:30,593 --> 01:22:31,640
- Are you asking for another thank you?

1577
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:33,207
- No I am not asking--

1578
01:22:33,207 --> 01:22:34,040
- Thank you for the brisket.

1579
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:34,873
- No.

1580
01:22:34,873 --> 01:22:35,706
- Thank you for the brisket.

1581
01:22:35,706 --> 01:22:37,130
- I have an idea.

1582
01:22:37,130 --> 01:22:39,160
I think we should fix the roof.

1583
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:43,160
- Excuse me?

1584
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:43,993
- Just to keep the leaves out.

1585
01:22:43,993 --> 01:22:45,600
And I mean, we could do it
before we go back tomorrow.

1586
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,540
- Now this, this is a friend.

1587
01:22:47,540 --> 01:22:48,450
- Stay out of this.

1588
01:22:48,450 --> 01:22:50,350
- I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

1589
01:22:50,350 --> 01:22:52,360
You and me, we're gonna go up on the roof

1590
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:54,560
tomorrow, and we're gonna fix it together.

1591
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:55,590
- Absolutely not.

1592
01:22:55,590 --> 01:22:57,280
- No, we're leaving tomorrow.

1593
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:59,180
- Richard, you are not going on the roof.

1594
01:22:59,180 --> 01:23:00,530
- I'll teach him how.

1595
01:23:00,530 --> 01:23:02,240
- Not in your state.

1596
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:05,150
- Now that I finally got
some real help around here.

1597
01:23:05,150 --> 01:23:06,050
- I told you.

1598
01:23:06,050 --> 01:23:08,150
Suck, suck, suck!

1599
01:23:08,150 --> 01:23:10,540
- If he wants to help, let him help.

1600
01:23:10,540 --> 01:23:11,860
- I wanna help.

1601
01:23:11,860 --> 01:23:12,983
- Okay.

1602
01:23:12,983 --> 01:23:14,160
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1603
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:15,380
I see what this is.

1604
01:23:15,380 --> 01:23:17,550
You're trying to make me
feel guilty for leaving.

1605
01:23:17,550 --> 01:23:20,280
- I'm not trying to
make you feel anything.

1606
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:21,390
- No, no, no it's fine, it's fine.

1607
01:23:21,390 --> 01:23:22,740
I apologize for having a life.

1608
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:24,960
- Okay, this is enough excitement for me.

1609
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:27,250
Um, I just wanna fix the roof.

1610
01:23:27,250 --> 01:23:28,083
That's all.

1611
01:23:28,083 --> 01:23:29,590
We can talk about the details tomorrow.

1612
01:23:31,310 --> 01:23:32,290
Goodnight.

1613
01:23:32,290 --> 01:23:34,240
Oh and PS, I'm Asian.

1614
01:23:38,530 --> 01:23:40,480
- I like that kid.

1615
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:42,120
That kid's good.

1616
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:43,350
That kids a pearl.

1617
01:24:05,878 --> 01:24:08,628
(light clicking)

1618
01:24:16,542 --> 01:24:18,959
(soft music)

1619
01:24:48,770 --> 01:24:51,150
- Brandon, can I give you a hand?

1620
01:24:51,150 --> 01:24:52,370
- I got it Mom.

1621
01:24:52,370 --> 01:24:54,200
- How about some breakfast?

1622
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:55,150
- I'm working here.

1623
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:14,540
- Why are you so hard on me?

1624
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:16,930
- You know, you just

1625
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:22,040
you mean well but sometimes you just,

1626
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:23,650
you sure show it.

1627
01:25:23,650 --> 01:25:25,500
- Why can't you just say you love me?

1628
01:25:26,740 --> 01:25:27,573
I love you.

1629
01:25:30,710 --> 01:25:31,990
That's it.

1630
01:25:34,278 --> 01:25:35,296
It's simple.

1631
01:25:35,296 --> 01:25:36,129
It's not complicated.

1632
01:25:36,129 --> 01:25:37,840
It's not multilevel.

1633
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:39,090
- Well, it's hard for me.

1634
01:25:40,110 --> 01:25:41,710
- [Mary] Why does it have to be?

1635
01:25:42,810 --> 01:25:43,643
- Because,

1636
01:25:45,331 --> 01:25:48,480
you love something and then it's just like

1637
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:51,420
you just squeeze the life out of it.

1638
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:53,834
- [Mary] You're blaming
me for what happened.

1639
01:25:53,834 --> 01:25:56,120
- [Brandon] (mumbling)
time, I don't blame you.

1640
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:57,630
- [Mary] You think I coddled him.

1641
01:25:57,630 --> 01:25:59,680
You think I loved him too much.

1642
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:01,310
- Mom, I,

1643
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:06,520
I can't talk about him with you alright?

1644
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:08,220
'Cause it doesn't change anything.

1645
01:26:10,487 --> 01:26:12,310
- We have to be able to talk about this.

1646
01:26:12,310 --> 01:26:13,440
- Just give me the ring.

1647
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:15,680
Why can't you just give me Roda's ring?

1648
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:16,870
- Because he wanted it.

1649
01:26:16,870 --> 01:26:18,212
- Who?

1650
01:26:18,212 --> 01:26:19,045
- Your brother.

1651
01:26:19,045 --> 01:26:19,878
- Mom, he's dead.

1652
01:26:19,878 --> 01:26:20,711
- He didn't want you to have it.

1653
01:26:20,711 --> 01:26:23,570
You got everything and everything
fell apart after you left!

1654
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:28,640
- You know why I don't come home?

1655
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:30,540
It isn't because of Travis
it's because of you.

1656
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:31,730
Because you take pills.

1657
01:26:31,730 --> 01:26:33,030
And then you keep taking them.

1658
01:26:33,030 --> 01:26:35,320
And you know what they make you crazy!

1659
01:26:37,609 --> 01:26:39,692
(crying)

1660
01:26:41,390 --> 01:26:43,571
(sighing)

1661
01:26:43,571 --> 01:26:44,404
(crying)

1662
01:26:44,404 --> 01:26:45,237
I'm sorry.

1663
01:26:45,237 --> 01:26:49,030
I shouldn't have said that.

1664
01:26:50,290 --> 01:26:51,560
- I am not crazy.

1665
01:26:52,510 --> 01:26:54,180
I have emotions.

1666
01:26:54,180 --> 01:26:56,800
But I'm not delusional.

1667
01:26:58,080 --> 01:26:59,490
I'm a mother.

1668
01:26:59,490 --> 01:27:01,020
I love my children.

1669
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:03,040
There is nothing wrong with that.

1670
01:27:03,940 --> 01:27:06,310
Do you wanna know what crazy is?

1671
01:27:06,310 --> 01:27:09,120
Crazy is not loving your mother.

1672
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:12,270
Crazy is taking everything
and not giving anything back.

1673
01:27:15,790 --> 01:27:16,990
- Just give me the ring.

1674
01:27:17,929 --> 01:27:18,762
Okay?

1675
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,680
- You want Roda's ring?

1676
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:22,820
- Yeah.

1677
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:24,180
- Fine.

1678
01:27:24,180 --> 01:27:25,230
You want Roda's ring?

1679
01:27:26,130 --> 01:27:26,963
You can have it.

1680
01:27:29,698 --> 01:27:31,948
(clanking)

1681
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:43,600
It's not here.

1682
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:44,550
- What do you mean?

1683
01:27:45,470 --> 01:27:47,860
- The ring, it's not there.

1684
01:27:48,779 --> 01:27:50,850
- Well, maybe you put it somewhere

1685
01:27:50,850 --> 01:27:52,520
and now you can't remember.

1686
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:55,780
- No I remember where I put it.

1687
01:27:56,711 --> 01:27:58,520
It's here somewhere.

1688
01:27:58,520 --> 01:27:59,960
- [Brandon] Mom, just wait.

1689
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:00,793
Just.

1690
01:28:04,670 --> 01:28:06,114
- Sorry.

1691
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:08,197
I didn't wanna interrupt.

1692
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:12,380
Anything I can do?

1693
01:28:13,773 --> 01:28:15,453
- I think you've done enough.

1694
01:28:15,453 --> 01:28:17,213
♪ Hi ho, hi ho ♪

1695
01:28:17,213 --> 01:28:18,350

1696
01:28:18,350 --> 01:28:19,890
- Great.

1697

1698
01:28:23,917 --> 01:28:25,572

1703
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:55,580
- Dad, you can't go on
the roof by yourself.

1704
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:58,400
- Then lend me a hand.

1705
01:29:07,390 --> 01:29:08,690
- Well you wanted to help.

1706
01:29:20,713 --> 01:29:23,380
(tarp rattling)

1707
01:29:38,371 --> 01:29:39,990
Wow, all this for a few solar panels.

1708
01:29:45,571 --> 01:29:46,584
- Yeah, they're worthless.

1709
01:29:46,584 --> 01:29:48,084
They never worked.

1710
01:29:49,331 --> 01:29:51,070
- You probably didn't install them right.

1711
01:29:51,070 --> 01:29:52,760
- They're connected to the invertor box.

1712
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:54,470
I followed the instructions.

1713
01:29:54,470 --> 01:29:56,371
- Maybe you connected them wrong.

1714
01:29:56,371 --> 01:29:57,204
- I didn't.

1715
01:29:57,204 --> 01:29:58,310
- Maybe you think they're connected,

1716
01:29:58,310 --> 01:30:00,330
but there's a wire loose or something.

1717
01:30:00,330 --> 01:30:01,180
- I did it right.

1718
01:30:02,990 --> 01:30:05,040
- Maybe you made a mistake.

1719
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:05,873
- I didn't.

1720
01:30:06,931 --> 01:30:07,764
- Alright, alright.

1721
01:30:09,290 --> 01:30:10,123
You got it.

1722
01:30:10,123 --> 01:30:11,150
We got this.

1723
01:30:11,150 --> 01:30:12,500
We got this.

1724
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:14,830
- Now that we're alone, you
wanna tell me what's going on?

1725
01:30:14,830 --> 01:30:15,800
- Like what?

1726
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:16,720
- [Brandon] Don't play dumb.

1727
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:17,553
Where'd you go?

1728
01:30:18,390 --> 01:30:20,557
(sighing)

1729
01:30:27,710 --> 01:30:29,710
- I leased a place over on Grove Street.

1730
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:36,950
I can't live with her anymore.

1731
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:43,050
- So you are leaving her?

1732
01:30:45,860 --> 01:30:46,693
- Now you know.

1733
01:30:49,894 --> 01:30:51,477
Yeah, now you know.

1734
01:30:53,391 --> 01:30:56,141
(items clanking)

1735
01:31:03,379 --> 01:31:04,212
- Damn.

1736
01:31:06,780 --> 01:31:08,300
Yeah, there we go.

1737
01:31:09,793 --> 01:31:10,793
There we go.

1738
01:31:12,936 --> 01:31:15,170
(grunting)

1739
01:31:15,170 --> 01:31:16,003
Yeah.

1740
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:18,060
Yeah.

1741
01:31:18,060 --> 01:31:20,780
What is it?

1742
01:31:20,780 --> 01:31:21,613
- Nothing.

1743
01:31:21,613 --> 01:31:22,446
Everything's fine.

1744
01:31:22,446 --> 01:31:24,070
- Okay, this is how it's gonna go.

1745
01:31:24,070 --> 01:31:25,870
We're gonna sitch this in real good.

1746
01:31:27,230 --> 01:31:28,776
Then we'll nail it down

1747
01:31:28,776 --> 01:31:29,610
with the nail gun.

1748
01:31:29,610 --> 01:31:31,118
- [Adam] Okay.

1749
01:31:31,118 --> 01:31:31,951
- [Dicky] Alright.

1750
01:31:31,951 --> 01:31:33,958
We're gonna need goggles.

1751
01:31:33,958 --> 01:31:34,791
Alright.

1752
01:31:42,190 --> 01:31:43,770
- I don't have any goggles.

1753
01:31:43,770 --> 01:31:45,270
- Well, be extra careful then.

1754
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:47,230
Alright?

1755
01:31:47,230 --> 01:31:48,880
Give me the nail gun.

1756
01:31:49,850 --> 01:31:51,379
- Hey!

1757
01:31:51,379 --> 01:31:52,398
What the.

1758
01:31:52,398 --> 01:31:53,231
What are you doing?

1759
01:31:53,231 --> 01:31:54,200
You pointing that thing right at me?

1760
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:55,510
- Relax I didn't point it at you.

1761
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:57,150
- You could've put a nail through my head.

1762
01:31:57,150 --> 01:31:58,670
- You asked me for the gun.

1763
01:31:58,670 --> 01:32:00,030
- Put down the gun.

1764
01:32:00,030 --> 01:32:01,360
- You asked me!

1765
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:02,320
- Adam?

1766
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:03,530
- What?

1767
01:32:03,530 --> 01:32:04,363
- Hand me the gun.

1768
01:32:04,363 --> 01:32:05,610
- I really don't wanna
be in the middle of this.

1769
01:32:05,610 --> 01:32:07,720
- Did you think I was trying to shoot you?

1770
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:09,470
- Accidents happen.

1771
01:32:09,470 --> 01:32:11,560
- You mean like this roof?

1772
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:14,310
(items clanking)

1773
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:17,330
Dad, the reason there's a hole in the roof

1774
01:32:17,330 --> 01:32:21,450
is because you forced a 300
pound person to stand on it.

1775
01:32:21,450 --> 01:32:25,290
- You saying I was responsible
for him being 300 pounds?

1776
01:32:25,290 --> 01:32:26,850
- He binged on peanut butter cups

1777
01:32:26,850 --> 01:32:28,770
because of the way that you treated him.

1778
01:32:28,770 --> 01:32:30,910
- Who bought'um the peanut butter cups?

1779
01:32:30,910 --> 01:32:31,743
- I don't,

1780
01:32:31,743 --> 01:32:32,910
I don't think we should be doing this.

1781
01:32:32,910 --> 01:32:35,250
Alright you guys are
both obviously heated.

1782
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:36,930
So maybe we should go downstairs

1783
01:32:36,930 --> 01:32:38,200
and maybe we could do this another time.

1784
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:39,580
- Are you quitting?

1785
01:32:39,580 --> 01:32:40,850
- No, I just wanna live.

1786
01:32:41,780 --> 01:32:42,613
That's all.

1787
01:32:42,613 --> 01:32:43,446
- Okay, yeah right.

1788
01:32:43,446 --> 01:32:44,279
(nail gun shooting)

1789
01:32:44,279 --> 01:32:45,900
- What the fuck!

1790
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:48,940
- You left the safety off.

1791
01:32:48,940 --> 01:32:51,150
- You almost shot me in the skull.

1792
01:32:51,150 --> 01:32:53,220
- You left the safety off, it's on now.

1793
01:32:53,220 --> 01:32:55,570
- You almost shoot me and
somehow it's my fault?

1794
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:57,500
- You left the safety off.

1795
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:59,800
- Why can't you take any responsibility?

1796
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:00,760
- It's nobody's fault.

1797
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:03,620
No one, no one had a fault here.

1798
01:33:03,620 --> 01:33:04,453
Alright?

1799
01:33:04,453 --> 01:33:05,310
This was just an accident.

1800
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:08,940
- [Mary] Where are you ring?

1801
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:14,850
- I wanted to do something

1802
01:33:14,850 --> 01:33:16,480
father and son.

1803
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:19,240
He liked gadgets, so
I bought solar panels.

1804
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:21,540
I thought he would like
to capture electricity,

1805
01:33:21,540 --> 01:33:24,260
rather than squirrels and possums.

1806
01:33:24,260 --> 01:33:25,330
You weren't there.

1807
01:33:25,330 --> 01:33:27,510
- Okay, so once again it's
my fault for having a life?

1808
01:33:27,510 --> 01:33:31,530
- You believe everything
your mother tells you,

1809
01:33:31,530 --> 01:33:33,680
because that's what you wanna believe.

1810
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:35,390
- If you never forced him on this roof,

1811
01:33:35,390 --> 01:33:37,490
he would've never taken any pills.

1812
01:33:37,490 --> 01:33:39,760
- Who do you think gave him those pills?

1813
01:33:48,827 --> 01:33:51,577
(items clanking)

1814
01:34:00,128 --> 01:34:02,295
(sighing)

1815
01:34:07,765 --> 01:34:09,932
(humming)

1816
01:34:20,543 --> 01:34:22,710
(nailing)

1817
01:34:27,222 --> 01:34:28,720
This is how you nail it in.

1818
01:34:41,679 --> 01:34:43,929
(rumbling)

1819
01:35:05,620 --> 01:35:06,639
- Travis.

1820
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:09,472
(emotional music)

1821
01:35:18,303 --> 01:35:19,670
- [Adam] Once upon a time, Jack ran

1822
01:35:19,670 --> 01:35:21,200
away hoping to fill a hole.

1823
01:35:22,970 --> 01:35:25,170
So he went to a big
city full of disfunction

1824
01:35:26,340 --> 01:35:28,240
where he met the queen of disfunction.

1825
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:31,000
But something was still missing.

1826
01:35:32,463 --> 01:35:34,570
Then one day he arrives at a home

1827
01:35:34,570 --> 01:35:36,320
where there was a hole in the roof.

1828
01:35:37,399 --> 01:35:40,360
(emotional music)

1829
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:43,100
Then suddenly, Jack found
a way to fill the hole.

1830
01:35:45,380 --> 01:35:47,930
And weirdly, everyone seemed
to function just fine.

1831
01:35:49,001 --> 01:35:51,834
(emotional music)

1832
01:36:40,540 --> 01:36:42,880
- I made some sandwiches for the drive.

1833
01:36:44,070 --> 01:36:46,710
I hope you didn't have
too terrible a time.

1834
01:36:46,710 --> 01:36:48,760
- No, I actually think it kind of helped.

1835
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:52,450
I got some good ideas
for my graphic novel.

1836
01:36:52,450 --> 01:36:54,050
- Can I see it?

1837
01:36:54,050 --> 01:36:54,883
- Mm hm.

1838
01:36:58,623 --> 01:37:02,100
Okay.

1839
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:02,933
So,

1840
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:07,310
it's not totally done,
but here are a few panels.

1841
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:11,970
- Is this a happy story?

1842
01:37:14,030 --> 01:37:16,390
- It's strange, but

1843
01:37:18,330 --> 01:37:19,163
it's good.

1844
01:37:22,770 --> 01:37:24,310
- This is fantastic.

1845
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:26,193
- Thanks.

1846
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:33,540
- Oh, what an artist you are.

1847
01:37:33,540 --> 01:37:34,630
- Thank you.

1848
01:37:34,630 --> 01:37:35,480
That means a lot.

1849
01:37:37,020 --> 01:37:37,853
Coming from you.

1850
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:42,160
- You better get going.

1851
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:44,360
- Brandon's downstairs just
going through some stuff.

1852
01:37:45,330 --> 01:37:46,163
- I see.

1853
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:48,420
- Just waiting on him.

1854
01:37:49,390 --> 01:37:51,040
- You think he's there for you Adam,

1855
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:53,370
but it's the other way around.

1856
01:37:58,090 --> 01:37:59,320
I'll get the sandwiches.

1857
01:38:09,343 --> 01:38:11,510
(sighing)

1858
01:38:20,340 --> 01:38:23,090
(birds chirping)

1859
01:38:38,030 --> 01:38:38,863
- [Brandon] Hey.

1860
01:38:38,863 --> 01:38:39,696
- Hey.

1861
01:38:40,664 --> 01:38:42,730
I packed your stuff in the car.

1862
01:38:42,730 --> 01:38:44,100
- Oh, hey thanks Adam.

1863
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:44,933
- Mm hm.

1864
01:38:44,933 --> 01:38:46,930
Ah, there's about a
quarter tank of gas left,

1865
01:38:46,930 --> 01:38:48,720
so we're gonna have to stop somewhere.

1866
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:50,320
- Listen, I may not go just yet.

1867
01:38:51,350 --> 01:38:52,755
- No?

1868
01:38:52,755 --> 01:38:53,754
- No.

1869
01:38:53,754 --> 01:38:54,587
I can drive you to the train station,

1870
01:38:54,587 --> 01:38:57,390
but I'm gonna need to stick
around a little longer.

1871
01:38:57,390 --> 01:38:58,290
- What about work?

1872
01:38:59,192 --> 01:39:00,850
- I'm taking a few days off.

1873
01:39:00,850 --> 01:39:01,683
- And Yuan?

1874
01:39:03,540 --> 01:39:06,240
- She thinks it's best if I
take some space right now.

1875
01:39:09,370 --> 01:39:10,719
- Okay.

1876
01:39:10,719 --> 01:39:11,552
- Yeah, my mom needs me.

1877
01:39:12,700 --> 01:39:13,533
- Right.

1878
01:39:19,438 --> 01:39:21,688
(laughing)

1879
01:39:22,638 --> 01:39:25,210
- This is my old um, goalie mask.

1880
01:39:30,100 --> 01:39:30,933
(laughing)

1881
01:39:30,933 --> 01:39:33,930
I used to ah, I told my brother

1882
01:39:34,779 --> 01:39:37,190
that if he wore this and the helmet

1883
01:39:37,190 --> 01:39:38,590
that it would keep him safe.

1884
01:39:39,470 --> 01:39:40,303
But the truth

1885
01:39:43,070 --> 01:39:43,903
was

1886
01:39:49,860 --> 01:39:51,210
I liked it when he wore it.

1887
01:39:57,110 --> 01:39:58,030
Because

1888
01:40:02,300 --> 01:40:04,250
then I didn't have to be seen with him.

1889
01:40:10,300 --> 01:40:11,330
I was so

1890
01:40:13,590 --> 01:40:14,660
fucking ah.

1891
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:18,230
- [Mary] Here's the sandwiches.

1892
01:40:22,660 --> 01:40:24,010
- I'll take the sandwiches.

1893
01:40:42,100 --> 01:40:44,933
(emotional music)

1894
01:40:59,963 --> 01:41:01,501
- There you go.

1895
01:41:01,501 --> 01:41:04,334
(emotional music)

1896
01:41:32,158 --> 01:41:32,991
- Hmm.

1897
01:41:34,156 --> 01:41:37,170
I think I'll take my paints
outside, do a landscape.

1898
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:39,950
Something I can hang and be proud of.

1899
01:41:40,820 --> 01:41:42,200
Bright and cheerful.

1900
01:41:43,380 --> 01:41:44,910
Alive with color.

1901
01:41:47,180 --> 01:41:48,460
- That sounds great Mom.

1902
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:51,240
- What are you waiting for?

1903
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:56,340
(gasping)

1904
01:41:56,340 --> 01:41:59,160
- I thought I'd help
you clean up the house.

1905
01:41:59,160 --> 01:42:00,760
- I'm not asking you to do that.

1906
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:06,500
- Do you have a Xanax?

1907
01:42:06,500 --> 01:42:07,333
- Oh dear god.

1908
01:42:08,221 --> 01:42:09,260
- Hey come on I'm outta weed.

1909
01:42:10,210 --> 01:42:13,650
- Brandon please don't
place me in this position.

1910
01:42:13,650 --> 01:42:15,550
- You let him have whatever he wanted.

1911
01:42:16,590 --> 01:42:18,960
- Hey, look at me.

1912
01:42:20,260 --> 01:42:21,093
Look at my hair.

1913
01:42:22,130 --> 01:42:23,090
It's curly.

1914
01:42:24,510 --> 01:42:25,343
Guess what?

1915
01:42:26,290 --> 01:42:27,470
I don't care anymore.

1916
01:42:29,050 --> 01:42:31,240
Everyone else always had straight hair.

1917
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:33,640
I've carried this straight hair

1918
01:42:33,640 --> 01:42:36,820
thing with me since the third grade.

1919
01:42:36,820 --> 01:42:39,010
All the pretty girls had straight hair.

1920
01:42:39,990 --> 01:42:41,450
But now I can finally say,

1921
01:42:44,610 --> 01:42:47,210
what do I care what any
of these people think?

1922
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:50,370
They're not doing anything for me anyway.

1923
01:42:52,580 --> 01:42:54,030
- What are you trying to say?

1924
01:42:56,870 --> 01:43:00,020
- The worst thing that
could happen has happened.

1925
01:43:01,970 --> 01:43:03,300
I woke up one morning,

1926
01:43:04,610 --> 01:43:08,250
and it was like the sun fell down.

1927
01:43:09,810 --> 01:43:12,050
I thought it was dawn but,

1928
01:43:12,050 --> 01:43:13,310
the sky was black.

1929
01:43:16,280 --> 01:43:18,690
And nothing ever made sense to me again.

1930
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:24,850
God took one of my children.

1931
01:43:27,810 --> 01:43:29,250
But he can't have you.

1932
01:43:35,740 --> 01:43:37,600
- Well I just feel like if I was here.

1933
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:39,190
- You can't think like that.

1934
01:43:39,190 --> 01:43:41,483
- How am I supposed to think?

1935
01:43:41,483 --> 01:43:43,120
- You have to have faith.

1936
01:43:43,120 --> 01:43:44,239
(laughing)

1937
01:43:44,239 --> 01:43:45,424
- Faith?

1938
01:43:45,424 --> 01:43:46,422
(laughing)

1939
01:43:46,422 --> 01:43:47,424
I mean.

1940
01:43:47,424 --> 01:43:49,050
(laughing)

1941
01:43:49,050 --> 01:43:49,990
You have faith?

1942
01:43:51,010 --> 01:43:52,180
- In my own way.

1943
01:43:53,580 --> 01:43:56,430
- Come on Mom, we're gonna
paint the walls yellow.

1944
01:43:56,430 --> 01:43:58,040
Put down new carpets.

1945
01:43:58,040 --> 01:43:59,542
- [Mary] Brandon.

1946
01:43:59,542 --> 01:44:00,544
- We're gonna hang your paintings.

1947
01:44:00,544 --> 01:44:01,430
And we're gonna clean up the kitchen.

1948
01:44:01,430 --> 01:44:03,490
- I want you to have a good life.

1949
01:44:03,490 --> 01:44:04,680
- I have a good life.

1950
01:44:04,680 --> 01:44:05,513
- Then leave.

1951
01:44:10,923 --> 01:44:13,173
(knocking)

1952
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:16,990
- Mind if we get going?

1953
01:44:16,990 --> 01:44:17,823
- Yeah, uh,

1954
01:44:19,100 --> 01:44:21,750
you know what I may be going
back with you after all.

1955
01:44:26,090 --> 01:44:27,620
- Let me know how it goes.

1956
01:44:37,222 --> 01:44:39,389
(sighing)

1957
01:44:42,944 --> 01:44:44,220
- I love you Mom.

1958
01:44:47,184 --> 01:44:48,430
You know that right?

1959
01:44:50,820 --> 01:44:51,653
- My love whore.

1960
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:09,370
- Why did you say it?

1961
01:45:10,720 --> 01:45:13,950
- You said it.

1962
01:45:13,950 --> 01:45:14,783
- Yeah I know.

1963
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:18,273
I did.

1964
01:45:19,807 --> 01:45:20,940
- What did you mean to say?

1965
01:45:22,364 --> 01:45:23,727
(sighing)

1966
01:45:23,727 --> 01:45:25,650
- I think I meant to say,

1967
01:45:27,530 --> 01:45:28,363
don't leave me.

1968
01:45:31,342 --> 01:45:32,175
- Oh.

1969
01:45:35,946 --> 01:45:38,779
(emotional music)

1970
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:42,507
- I'll be back.

1971
01:45:42,507 --> 01:45:45,124
- I know you will.

1972
01:45:45,124 --> 01:45:47,957
(emotional music)

1973
01:46:50,804 --> 01:46:53,487
(stuffed animal thudding)

1974
01:46:53,487 --> 01:46:56,320
(emotional music)

1975
01:47:33,964 --> 01:47:35,041
- Huh?

1976
01:47:35,041 --> 01:47:35,875
- Huh?

1977
01:47:35,875 --> 01:47:36,708
- [Brandon] Nothing.

1978
01:47:36,708 --> 01:47:37,541
- Nothing.
