1
00:00:17,413 --> 00:00:21,088
A case to end all cases.

2
00:00:32,853 --> 00:00:35,572
You know what I mean, Dinah?

3
00:00:36,173 --> 00:00:38,892
I used to think being
a private detective was cool.

4
00:00:39,053 --> 00:00:42,250
Like Sam Spade
or Phillip Marlowe, right?

5
00:00:42,413 --> 00:00:45,325
But there's nothing cool left to it.

6
00:00:46,453 --> 00:00:51,573
On top of that, both my fridge
and my bank account are empty.

7
00:01:01,173 --> 00:01:02,162
Wait.

8
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:04,164
Okay, Dinah, let's bet.

9
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:09,123
If it's another suspicious husband,
I'm out of this business forever.

10
00:01:10,213 --> 00:01:13,842
-Hello?
-Mr. Ash, I have a job for you.

11
00:01:14,013 --> 00:01:17,449
And you need me
to check on your wife, right?

12
00:01:17,613 --> 00:01:19,683
I'm looking for a computer hacker.

13
00:01:19,853 --> 00:01:23,050
This hacker goes by the alias Trinity.
That's all we know.

14
00:01:23,213 --> 00:01:25,966
Well, it looks like we're still
in business, Dinah.

15
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:28,328
Fine. And who will I be working for?

16
00:01:28,493 --> 00:01:30,768
-I can 't say.
-You can't say.

17
00:01:30,933 --> 00:01:33,925
Call me back when you can say.
That's not the way I do business.

18
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:35,765
It was a pleasure chatting with you.

19
00:01:35,933 --> 00:01:40,882
Before you hang up, take a look
at your bank account balance.

20
00:01:47,293 --> 00:01:50,444
I didn 't get a good feeling
about the case.

21
00:01:50,893 --> 00:01:54,602
But I had no good reason
to turn the guy down now.

22
00:01:55,173 --> 00:01:57,482
This Trinity was well-known
in hacker circles.

23
00:01:58,013 --> 00:02:00,368
A real artist by the sound of it.

24
00:02:00,533 --> 00:02:03,764
The cops were always
one step behind him.

25
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:07,928
So I knew I could get that close.
Question was, could I get closer?

26
00:02:08,093 --> 00:02:11,768
I had a few tricks up my sleeve
for getting to hackers.

27
00:02:13,093 --> 00:02:18,167
While I was searching,
I found something strange.

28
00:02:20,893 --> 00:02:23,407
Other detectives had been
on the case too.

29
00:02:23,573 --> 00:02:28,693
And their investigations had all been,
shall we say, troubled.

30
00:02:28,853 --> 00:02:30,605
One of the guys killed himself.

31
00:02:31,093 --> 00:02:33,004
Another had disappeared.

32
00:02:33,973 --> 00:02:36,043
Another went crazy.

33
00:02:36,453 --> 00:02:40,332
So I paid the one
who was left a visit.

34
00:02:40,813 --> 00:02:42,804
The crazy one.

35
00:02:46,173 --> 00:02:50,644
Trinity doesn't exist, man.
He's not real.

36
00:02:50,813 --> 00:02:55,603
He's a figment. A cipher.
A jabberwocky.

37
00:02:56,893 --> 00:03:01,011
And who am l? Who the hell am l?

38
00:03:08,093 --> 00:03:10,288
Did I mention he was crazy?

39
00:03:14,413 --> 00:03:18,292
Chessboards, jabberwocky,
Red Queen....

40
00:03:18,453 --> 00:03:20,842
I started searching
all the usual hacker hangouts...

41
00:03:21,013 --> 00:03:23,686
...for someone with
an Alice in Wonderland m.o.

42
00:03:23,853 --> 00:03:27,163
Hacker bulletin boards,
anonymous mailboxes, chat rooms.

43
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:31,212
And it was in one of those
that I picked up Trinity's trail.

44
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:37,331
"Six brooks. "

45
00:04:37,693 --> 00:04:41,208
"I'll be there at 2005. "

46
00:04:47,773 --> 00:04:49,001
Of course!

47
00:04:49,173 --> 00:04:51,971
Crossing the second brook
takes her into the woods.

48
00:04:52,133 --> 00:04:54,806
Alice jumps the first brook. . .

49
00:04:54,973 --> 00:04:56,691
. . .and. . . .

50
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:01,725
And then she boards a train.

51
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:09,325
Thanks.

52
00:05:15,493 --> 00:05:16,687
Excuse me.

53
00:05:18,453 --> 00:05:19,647
Hey!

54
00:05:20,093 --> 00:05:21,685
Hey!

55
00:05:45,653 --> 00:05:47,769
I knew this was some kind of trap.

56
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:52,529
There's a difference, Mr. Ash,
between a trap and a test.

57
00:05:52,693 --> 00:05:54,809
You were testing me?

58
00:05:54,973 --> 00:05:57,885
You made it. I'm impressed.

59
00:05:58,453 --> 00:06:01,172
Flattery will get you everywhere.

60
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:04,052
I'm not here to flatter you,
I'm here to save you.

61
00:06:19,733 --> 00:06:21,485
What just happened?

62
00:06:21,653 --> 00:06:24,531
Mr. Ash, dream of having
an eye exam lately?

63
00:06:27,213 --> 00:06:29,773
Yeah, how'd you know?

64
00:06:30,693 --> 00:06:33,605
You've stepped
to the edge of the looking glass.

65
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:38,450
So then, that means I wasn't dreaming.

66
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:46,006
They hired me as a way
of getting to you, didn't they?

67
00:06:50,453 --> 00:06:52,171
Go!

68
00:07:12,013 --> 00:07:15,847
What the hell is going on here?
This is really crazy.

69
00:07:16,013 --> 00:07:18,766
Now I understand what happened
to those other detectives.

70
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:20,685
They went nuts.

71
00:07:23,453 --> 00:07:26,923
Well, I've gotten out
of worse jams than this.

72
00:07:27,093 --> 00:07:29,846
I am not gonna let them get you.

73
00:07:34,373 --> 00:07:36,409
What's happening to me?

74
00:07:42,173 --> 00:07:43,401
I'm sorry.

75
00:07:43,573 --> 00:07:46,246
You didn't make it, Mr. Ash.

76
00:07:54,573 --> 00:07:56,211
I wish. . .

77
00:07:56,373 --> 00:07:58,568
. . .I could go with you.

78
00:07:59,773 --> 00:08:01,684
I don't blame you, you know.

79
00:08:01,853 --> 00:08:04,890
Everything that happened, Trinity,
it was all my fault.

80
00:08:07,693 --> 00:08:11,606
All that Through the Looking Glass stuff.

81
00:08:13,013 --> 00:08:16,164
Can't get my head around it.
I'm old-fashioned.

82
00:08:19,693 --> 00:08:23,242
There's a difference between
a test and a choice.

83
00:08:25,293 --> 00:08:28,524
For what it's worth,
I think you could've handled the truth.

84
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,123
It was just a job.

85
00:08:34,293 --> 00:08:36,488
Goodbye, Trinity.

86
00:08:37,093 --> 00:08:38,765
Goodbye.

87
00:09:15,933 --> 00:09:19,289
A case to end all cases.

88
00:09:22,613 --> 00:09:23,602
