Daniel, I'm scared.

Shh.

17
00:02:17,343 --> 00:02:19,508
Daniel, please.
They're trying to kill me.

18
00:02:19,842 --> 00:02:22,942
(groans) Please help me.
Daniel, please.

19
00:02:23,508 --> 00:02:24,475
He's in here.

20
00:02:24,575 --> 00:02:26,009
No, no, no! God, no!

HELENE:
No, Charles! Stop!

Charles.

Daniel, I'm so proud of you.

Please, listen to...

30
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:56,442
You don't have to do this.
Nothing's gonna happen.

00:02:56,542 --> 00:02:58,243
(gasping, groaning)

32
00:02:58,343 --> 00:03:01,575
Helene! Helene,
please just talk to them.

00:03:01,942 --> 00:03:03,076
Helene!

00:03:04,076 --> 00:03:06,709

<i>To have and to hold.</i>

<i>From this day forward.</i>

39
00:03:19,508 --> 00:03:21,709
For better, for worse.

40
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:26,475
For richer, for poorer.

41
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:29,375
In sickness, and in health.

42
00:03:31,076 --> 00:03:32,642
Till death do us part.

43
00:03:34,942 --> 00:03:40,076
And even though your family
is richer than God,

44
00:03:40,575 --> 00:03:42,675
intimidates
the hell out of me...

45
00:03:43,542 --> 00:03:44,976
your dad definitely hates me,

46
00:03:45,076 --> 00:03:47,742
and your alcoholic brother
keeps hitting on me...

47
00:03:56,675 --> 00:04:00,609
I honestly can't wait to be a part
of your moderately fucked-up family.

48
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:03,309
"Moderately"?
That's pretty generous.

49
00:04:03,408 --> 00:04:04,575
- Hi.
- Hey.

50
00:04:04,675 --> 00:04:07,076
- (giggles)
- Holy shit!

51
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:11,009
You look perfect.

52
00:04:11,942 --> 00:04:13,042
What're you doing?

53
00:04:13,142 --> 00:04:15,375
You smoking? In my old room?

54
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:17,642
Give me that.

55
00:04:19,309 --> 00:04:20,642
We should get down there.

56
00:04:21,475 --> 00:04:22,976
GRACE: Your dad looks
like he's at a funeral.

57
00:04:23,076 --> 00:04:25,243
- He hates me.
- No. He doesn't hate you, Grace.

58
00:04:25,343 --> 00:04:26,542
He thinks
I'm after your money.

59
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:29,375
Well, I mean, that's true.
Yeah.

60
00:04:29,475 --> 00:04:31,475
- You just gotta give it time...
- (laughs) So mean!

61
00:04:31,575 --> 00:04:33,542
What? No, it's true.

62
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:36,076
Honey, just give it time.
Okay?

63
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:37,976
- Okay.
- Okay? We sprung this on them.

64
00:04:38,076 --> 00:04:41,609
- Yeah.
- They're used to a three-year courtship.

65
00:04:42,109 --> 00:04:43,508
And not what we did.

66
00:04:43,609 --> 00:04:45,009
The, I don't know,
18-month...

67
00:04:45,109 --> 00:04:46,076
Bone-a-thon.

68
00:04:46,176 --> 00:04:47,942
"Bone-a-thon"? Okay. Yeah.

69
00:04:48,042 --> 00:04:49,976
- We should put that in the vows.
- I did.

70
00:04:50,076 --> 00:04:51,375
- Oh, good.
- Mm-hmm.

71
00:04:52,942 --> 00:04:55,442
Anyway, who cares what they think?
They're horrible people.

72
00:04:57,775 --> 00:04:59,842
Well, I-I care what they think.

73
00:04:59,942 --> 00:05:02,742
Because they are the family
of the man that I love.

74
00:05:02,842 --> 00:05:04,642
And I want them to accept me.

75
00:05:05,076 --> 00:05:07,343
Are you okay? 'Cause I'm
nervous enough as it is.

76
00:05:07,442 --> 00:05:09,076
No, it's not that. I just...

77
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,076
Without you, I'm...

78
00:05:11,176 --> 00:05:13,009
- DANIEL: One of us.
- ALEX: Hey.

79
00:05:13,109 --> 00:05:15,176
- GRACE: Daniel.
- I've been sent to fetch you.

80
00:05:15,276 --> 00:05:20,176
<i>♪ Here comes the groom
shitting his pants ♪</i>

81
00:05:20,276 --> 00:05:21,209
<i>♪ He cannot believe</i>

82
00:05:21,309 --> 00:05:23,542
<i>♪ That his entire life is over ♪</i>
- Daniel, you fuck. Stop it.

83
00:05:23,642 --> 00:05:26,809
I'm gonna let you go
in three, two... release.

84
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:27,942
(Alex pants)

85
00:05:28,042 --> 00:05:29,142
Take it easy.

86
00:05:29,809 --> 00:05:32,109
It's not too late to flee,
you know.

87
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:33,642
You don't belong
in this family.

88
00:05:33,742 --> 00:05:35,508
I mean that
as a compliment.

89
00:05:39,609 --> 00:05:42,675
Okay. Well, if you're still
determined to be a Le Domas,

90
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:45,709
then would you please
get yourselves outside. Okay?

91
00:05:46,276 --> 00:05:48,442
Congratulations, you fuckface.

92
00:05:49,343 --> 00:05:50,575
Thank you.

93
00:05:52,475 --> 00:05:55,842
I can't believe
that in half an hour...

94
00:05:56,642 --> 00:06:01,508
I will be a part of
the Le Domas gaming...

95
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,609
dynasty? Empire?

96
00:06:03,709 --> 00:06:05,276
"Dominion."
We prefer "dominion."

97
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,976
- "Dominion."
- Yeah. But...

98
00:06:07,442 --> 00:06:09,475
- Um...
- (chuckles)

99
00:06:11,243 --> 00:06:12,642
You know, Daniel's right.

100
00:06:14,609 --> 00:06:17,675
We could just... leave.

101
00:06:17,775 --> 00:06:20,142
Oh, sure, yeah. "Thanks for the presents.
Go fuck yourselves."

102
00:06:20,243 --> 00:06:22,675
- No. I'm serious, I'm serious, honey.
- (Grace laughs)

103
00:06:27,109 --> 00:06:28,775
I'm giving you an out.

104
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:30,942
Right now.

105
00:06:34,609 --> 00:06:37,408
No, thank you.
I'm all the way in.

106
00:06:45,575 --> 00:06:47,076
Are you ready for this?

107
00:06:47,176 --> 00:06:48,442
Oh, fuck no.

108
00:06:55,508 --> 00:06:57,508
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Smile, please.

109
00:07:28,234 --> 00:07:29,401
(shutter clicks)

110
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,201
He could've
done so much better.

111
00:07:31,301 --> 00:07:34,234
You're just saying that
because he's your favorite.

112
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,767
Oh, please.
I love all of you... equally.

113
00:07:39,101 --> 00:07:40,434
(laughs)

114
00:07:40,533 --> 00:07:43,533
TONY: Two years
is a long time, Alex.

115
00:07:43,867 --> 00:07:46,001
I started to think
we'd really lost you.

116
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,600
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Smile. Smile, please.

117
00:07:49,867 --> 00:07:52,034
The more natural the better.

118
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:53,967
Okay, that's good.

119
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:55,900
DANIEL:
Don't take it personally.

120
00:07:56,001 --> 00:07:58,900
They're just trying to figure out
if you're a gold-digging whore.

121
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:00,934
You know, like my wife.

122
00:08:01,034 --> 00:08:02,301
To the left.

123
00:08:02,401 --> 00:08:03,533
She's pretty enough,

124
00:08:03,633 --> 00:08:06,001
in a "last call at
the dive bar" kinda way.

125
00:08:07,301 --> 00:08:08,533
But she'll never be one of us.

126
00:08:08,633 --> 00:08:10,600
Of course not, dear.

127
00:08:11,067 --> 00:08:12,667
She has a soul.

128
00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:14,301
Where the hell's your sister?

129
00:08:14,934 --> 00:08:16,500
I'm sure it's Fitch's fault.

130
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,934
He's useless.
But he's one of us.

131
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:21,167
Is Grace?

132
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:23,700
(clears throat)

133
00:08:25,734 --> 00:08:27,734
BECKY:
There you are.

134
00:08:27,834 --> 00:08:29,034
Hi!

135
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,167
Hi.

136
00:08:33,334 --> 00:08:34,967
- Give me a hand.
- Oh. Okay.

137
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:36,101
(lighter clicks)

138
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:38,934
(Grace chuckles)

139
00:08:39,767 --> 00:08:41,434
It's a beautiful case, wow.

140
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:43,267
BECKY:
Thank you. It was my mother's.

141
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,001
Do you smoke?

142
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,834
Oh, no.

143
00:08:48,867 --> 00:08:49,834
Nervous?

144
00:08:51,468 --> 00:08:52,667
Ah.

145
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:55,334
Because your blood
isn't blue enough?

146
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:56,434
(chuckles)

147
00:08:56,533 --> 00:08:58,900
They said
the same thing about me.

148
00:08:59,001 --> 00:09:00,201
They did?

149
00:09:00,301 --> 00:09:03,301
Stand tall and fuck 'em.

150
00:09:03,401 --> 00:09:04,700
(laughs)

151
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,567
The only thing that matters
is what Alex thinks.

152
00:09:09,134 --> 00:09:11,900
And that we know.

153
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:14,234
- (Grace chuckles)
- (applause)

154
00:09:17,734 --> 00:09:20,167
- (applause continues)
- (cheering)

155
00:09:20,267 --> 00:09:22,368
- I love you.
- I love you.

156
00:09:22,468 --> 00:09:23,500
I have something?

157
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,034
(Grace laughs)

158
00:09:58,001 --> 00:10:01,001
- ALEX: Oh, shit. Shh.
- (Grace laughs)

159
00:10:03,134 --> 00:10:06,234
(giggles) Do you remember
anything that happened today?

160
00:10:06,334 --> 00:10:07,434
It's a goddamn blur.

161
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:09,267
- But I'm pretty sure...
- Yeah.

162
00:10:10,633 --> 00:10:12,001
- Did we get married?
- We got married.

163
00:10:12,101 --> 00:10:13,301
Are you my wife?

164
00:10:13,401 --> 00:10:15,667
- Holy shit. Holy fucking shit.
- Yes. You're my husband!

165
00:10:15,767 --> 00:10:17,967
Oh, my God. Shit. Oh, babe.

166
00:10:18,067 --> 00:10:19,201
- Babe.
- Hey.

167
00:10:19,301 --> 00:10:20,267
It's hard with this thing.

168
00:10:20,368 --> 00:10:21,600
- I know. Listen.
- Hold me.

169
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,834
- I have to tell you something...
- Mm-mm.

170
00:10:22,934 --> 00:10:24,667
(kisses) Shut up.
Take your pants off.

171
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:25,934
No, I have to tell you
something.

172
00:10:26,034 --> 00:10:28,034
- Grace, honey.
- I'm taking 'em off.

173
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,167
Holy shit! Holy shit.
Someone's here.

174
00:10:33,267 --> 00:10:34,533
ALEX: What?

175
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:36,633
Jesus, Aunt Helene!
Can you give us a minute?

176
00:10:36,734 --> 00:10:39,301
You'll have to hide
better than that.

177
00:10:39,401 --> 00:10:41,301
We're not fucking hiding,
obviously.

178
00:10:41,401 --> 00:10:43,034
Everyone is waiting.

179
00:10:43,134 --> 00:10:45,167
Yeah, we'll be down
in a few minutes.

180
00:10:49,468 --> 00:10:51,633
- I'm sorry, honey.
- What the hell was that?

181
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,001
That's my aunt Helene.

182
00:10:53,101 --> 00:10:56,301
She has, um...
well, she has boundary issues.

183
00:10:56,401 --> 00:10:57,633
Yeah.

184
00:10:58,967 --> 00:11:01,700
GRACE: Of course
you have a secret door.

185
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,301
It's a servant's corridor.

186
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,368
They run
all through the house.

187
00:11:05,468 --> 00:11:06,900
(chuckles)

188
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,834
Um, sorry, who's waiting?

189
00:11:09,934 --> 00:11:10,967
(Alex sighs)

190
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:13,600
That's what I was trying
to tell you. Um...

191
00:11:15,834 --> 00:11:16,900
(scoffs)

192
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,967
So, at midnight
you have to play a game.

193
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:27,134
It's just something we do when
someone new joins the family.

194
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:29,301
- A game?
- Yeah.

195
00:11:29,401 --> 00:11:30,834
What game?

196
00:11:30,934 --> 00:11:33,500
I don't know.
Uh, you draw a card.

197
00:11:34,201 --> 00:11:37,700
Could be backgammon, croquet,
checkers, for all I know.

198
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,234
I know. I know. It's stupid.

199
00:11:40,334 --> 00:11:42,101
It's a little weird.

200
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,967
Why, exactly?

201
00:11:44,067 --> 00:11:48,700
I guess, because we made our money in
games, it's part of the initiation.

202
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,234
- Do I have to win?
- No. You just... you just have to play.

203
00:11:52,334 --> 00:11:54,834
- And then...
- And then you...

204
00:11:54,934 --> 00:11:57,001
you are officially
part of the family.

205
00:11:57,101 --> 00:11:59,967
Honestly, it means more to
them than the wedding itself.

206
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,600
- That's it?
- Yeah, that's it.

207
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:07,500
I know it's ridiculous.

208
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,967
It's just a weird
family ritual.

209
00:12:09,067 --> 00:12:10,533
And we only have to
do it once. All right?

210
00:12:10,633 --> 00:12:13,167
(chuckles) Okay.

211
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:14,767
- Yeah.
- Okay.

212
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,867
If it gets your family
to accept me,

213
00:12:16,967 --> 00:12:21,967
I will play the shit out...
of checkers.

214
00:12:23,567 --> 00:12:25,434
- I'm really good at it.
- Okay.

215
00:12:25,533 --> 00:12:31,001
Okay. You go buy me ten minutes
'cause I gotta put on... my game face.

216
00:12:31,101 --> 00:12:33,533
- I see what you did there. Very good.
- Right.

217
00:12:33,633 --> 00:12:36,633
Okay. So, uh, I'll meet you
downstairs. Music room.

218
00:12:36,734 --> 00:12:39,434
Ah. Yes. A totally normal room
to have in a house.

219
00:12:39,533 --> 00:12:42,934
Just... It is just downstairs.
It's your second door on the right.

220
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,134
(Grace chuckles) Okay.

221

- Hi.

- Your vows were beautiful.
- Oh. Thank you.

239
00:14:04,234 --> 00:14:07,767
Alex didn't tell us you were
brought up in foster homes.

240
00:14:07,867 --> 00:14:11,134
Not that he tells us anything
these days. Champagne?

GRACE:
Oh. Thank you. Thanks.

242
00:14:13,034 --> 00:14:14,967
My foster parents
were great people.

243
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
And, you know,
they did what they could.

244
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,267
But it was always temporary.

245
00:14:19,867 --> 00:14:22,700
I always sort of dreamed
of having a... a family.

246
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,934
I mean, I'm sure Alex would've
loved living in sin forever.

247
00:14:26,034 --> 00:14:27,468
I don't doubt it.

248
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:33,600
But he, um, he really understood
how important it was for me to...

249
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:40,800
finally have a real,
permanent family.

250
00:14:41,834 --> 00:14:43,867
And I just don't
wanna let you down.

251
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,533
Grace. When I first saw you,
I said to Tony:

252
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:51,533
"Finally. One of our children
has brought home a good one."

253
00:14:52,034 --> 00:14:56,900
And you don't know how grateful we
are that you brought Alex back to us.

254
00:14:58,134 --> 00:15:00,567
But please...

255
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:04,067
try to bring him back
into the fold.

256
00:15:06,134 --> 00:15:07,667
We're his family.

257
00:15:08,101 --> 00:15:09,134
I promise.

258
00:15:11,434 --> 00:15:12,700

265
00:15:27,633 --> 00:15:29,167
What'd she say to you?

266
00:15:29,267 --> 00:15:30,533
GRACE:
Oh, she's so sweet.

267
00:15:30,633 --> 00:15:31,900

No. No.

269
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:34,201
All right.

270
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:38,434
Are you okay?
Did something happen?

271
00:15:38,533 --> 00:15:39,767
Yeah, no.

272
00:15:39,867 --> 00:15:41,500
I just,
I don't feel very well.

273
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,567
Well, if you wanna lie down,
can't we just play the game tomorrow?

274
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:46,101
- No, no, it has to be tonight.
- BOY: Hands up!

275

Whoo! (laughs)

- Hi, Fitch. How are you?

289
00:16:14,067 --> 00:16:16,368
FITCH: Well done.
Sorry we cut it so close.

290
00:16:16,468 --> 00:16:19,500
We couldn't get our regular charter
out of de Gaulle this morning.

291
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,500
And I cannot fly
commercial anymore, right?

292
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,434
- It's the worst. You understand.
- EMILIE: Grace!

293
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:25,533
Hi!

294
00:16:25,633 --> 00:16:26,700
- GRACE: Hi!
- I'm Emilie.

295
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,600
Oh, my God,
your dress is amazing!

296
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,267
I've been totally
stalking you on Instagram.

297
00:16:30,368 --> 00:16:32,101
Oh, really? That's...

298
00:16:35,034 --> 00:16:37,101
- (Grace chuckles)
- We're gonna be best friends. (giggles)

299
00:16:37,201 --> 00:16:38,734
Hi. Nice to see you.

300
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,267
I'm so excited to be
a part of your family.

301
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:42,734
(gasps) Me too, me too!

302
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:45,734
He will decide that, my dear.

303
00:16:45,834 --> 00:16:48,334
Aunt Helene.
It's nice to see you.

304
00:16:48,434 --> 00:16:50,368
Brown-haired niece.

305
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:52,633
You continue to exist.

306
00:16:53,767 --> 00:16:57,934
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is 11:55.

307
00:17:04,334 --> 00:17:06,234
This is gonna blow your mind.

308
00:17:06,533 --> 00:17:08,134
Oh, okay. (laughs)

309
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:14,800
So this room is reserved
for family members only.

310
00:17:19,301 --> 00:17:20,934
After you, my dear.

311
00:17:27,301 --> 00:17:28,533
Holy shit.

312
00:17:38,101 --> 00:17:40,700
TONY: Great-Grandfather
enjoyed his games.

313
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,934
Grace.

314
00:18:06,967 --> 00:18:08,167
Have a seat.

315
00:18:12,267 --> 00:18:13,667
Do you like to play games?

316
00:18:14,101 --> 00:18:18,201
Um, I guess it depends on
what we're playing. (chuckles)

317
00:18:18,301 --> 00:18:20,533
Well, we'll know in a moment.

318
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:25,600
I gather you've noticed our
family is big on tradition.

319
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:33,134
And now, well, now the time has come
for you to join us in those traditions.

320
00:18:33,234 --> 00:18:34,700
Ooh. Story time.

321
00:18:35,368 --> 00:18:37,567
TONY: As you may know,
my great-grandfather, Victor,

322
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:41,368
set up a modest printing shop
during the Civil War,

323
00:18:41,468 --> 00:18:42,967
manufacturing playing cards.

324
00:18:43,067 --> 00:18:44,368
A generation later,

325
00:18:44,468 --> 00:18:48,600
my grandfather expanded into
sporting goods and board games.

326
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:54,067
Under my leadership, Le Domas Family Games
acquired four professional sports teams

327
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:57,667
and reached,
well, even greater heights.

328
00:18:58,334 --> 00:19:00,401
Some may call it luck,

329
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,234
but, well,
it's a little more than that.

330
00:19:04,134 --> 00:19:08,067
You know, it's almost as if
someone's watching over us.

331
00:19:08,167 --> 00:19:11,067
It all began with
a very generous benefactor.

332
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:13,667
And this box.

333
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:19,001
You see, originally,
Great-Grandfather was a merchant seaman.

334
00:19:19,101 --> 00:19:20,334
It was a hard life.

335
00:19:20,434 --> 00:19:22,834
And, like so many,
he wanted more.

336
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:25,700
On one of his
many excursions abroad,

337
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,001
Great-Grandfather
came to meet a Mr. Le Bail.

338
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,600
He was a... He was
a passenger aboard the ship.

339
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,301
A collector, of sorts.

340
00:19:33,401 --> 00:19:36,900
Purchasing exotic antiquities
to resell to wealthy Americans.

341
00:19:37,001 --> 00:19:41,001
After discovering a mutual
passion for games of chance,

342
00:19:41,101 --> 00:19:43,834
they passed a great many hours
playing cards.

343
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:48,401
And among Mr. Le Bail's
possessions was...

344
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,667
that box.

345
00:19:50,767 --> 00:19:53,134
And one evening,
after indulging in more than

346
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:54,734
- their fair ration of rum...
- (clears throat)

347
00:19:54,834 --> 00:19:57,267
TONY: Mr. Le Bail
proposed a wager.

348
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:02,067
If Great-Grandfather could
solve the mystery of the box

349
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:03,800
before arriving at port,

350
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,600
Mr. Le Bail would finance any
endeavor of Grandfather's choosing.

351
00:20:08,234 --> 00:20:09,267
Well...

352
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:15,267
Great-Grandfather whiled away the
long hours at sea studying the box.

353
00:20:15,368 --> 00:20:16,334
Until finally...

354
00:20:16,434 --> 00:20:17,967
(box clicking, whirring)

355
00:20:22,434 --> 00:20:23,633
And since that time...

356
00:20:24,533 --> 00:20:30,067
whenever the Le Domases are presented
with a new addition to the family...

357
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:35,867
we place a blank
playing card into the box.

358
00:20:36,967 --> 00:20:42,567
Our initiate then has the
privilege of drawing the card,

359
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:47,234
and Mr. Le Bail will tell us
which game to play.

360
00:20:49,267 --> 00:20:50,234
I got chess.

361
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:51,633
I got Old Maid.

362
00:20:52,134 --> 00:20:54,067
Seriously,
what the fuck is Old Maid?

363
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:55,267
Fitch...

364
00:20:57,867 --> 00:20:58,900
(chuckles)

365
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:02,001
(chuckles, giggles)

366
00:21:03,234 --> 00:21:05,900
So I just take out the card?

367
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,834
My dear, it is your turn.

368
00:21:11,368 --> 00:21:13,500
(box clicking, whirring)

369
00:21:16,201 --> 00:21:17,700
(clicking, whirring stops)

370
00:21:21,267 --> 00:21:23,401
(chuckles)

371
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,368
What does it say, girl?

372
00:21:25,468 --> 00:21:27,234
Oh. It says...

373
00:21:27,334 --> 00:21:28,667
It says, "hide and seek."

374
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:30,500
Are we really gonna play that?

375
00:21:38,301 --> 00:21:40,001
Everything okay?

376
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:42,201
Uh...

377
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,201
Yeah. Yeah.
Those are the rules.

378
00:21:46,834 --> 00:21:48,533
Hide and seek, right, Dad?

379
00:21:50,334 --> 00:21:51,867
Yes, indeed.

380
00:21:53,134 --> 00:21:54,334
Those are the rules.

381
00:21:55,234 --> 00:21:59,267
Okay, so, uh, who...
who hides and who seeks?

382
00:21:59,368 --> 00:22:02,900
Well, it's your initiation,
my dear.

383
00:22:03,001 --> 00:22:05,667
You get to be the one
to, uh, to hide.

384
00:22:06,401 --> 00:22:07,334
Of course.

385
00:22:07,434 --> 00:22:09,167
(knocks)

386
00:22:09,267 --> 00:22:11,834
This is gonna be fun, honey.
Yeah, just come meet me in my room, okay?

387
00:22:11,934 --> 00:22:14,401
- No, I wanna play for real. This is so weird.
- No, no. I know.

388
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,934
Um, so, to Mister... Le Bail.

389
00:22:20,434 --> 00:22:21,401
To Mr. Le Bail.

390
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,034
- To Mr. Le Bail.
- To Mr. Le Bail.

391
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,167
(Grace chuckles)

392
00:22:26,401 --> 00:22:28,334
TONY:
<i>The rules are simple.</i>

393
00:22:28,468 --> 00:22:31,034
You can hide
anywhere inside the house.

394
00:22:31,401 --> 00:22:36,533
We then count to 100 and
try to, um... well, find you.

395
00:22:36,834 --> 00:22:39,667
Well, don't you think you have
a little bit of an advantage?

396
00:22:40,201 --> 00:22:42,667
TONY: Oh. No, no.
We never use the cameras.

397
00:22:42,767 --> 00:22:46,767
<i>We always play the games as they would've
been played in Great-Grandfather's time.</i>

398
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:47,700
<i>Always.</i>

399
00:22:48,001 --> 00:22:50,633
So, there's no way
for me to win, right?

400
00:22:50,734 --> 00:22:54,867
Well, you could, I mean,
stay hidden till dawn.

401
00:22:54,967 --> 00:22:57,234
(Tony laughs)

402
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,700
- No, thank you.
- No.

403
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,234
<i>We're gonna start the count</i>

404
00:23:01,334 --> 00:23:03,134
just as soon
as you leave, okay?

405
00:23:03,234 --> 00:23:04,368
Okay.

406
00:23:04,468 --> 00:23:06,934
Grace, good luck.

407
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:09,567

Thank you, Charity.

459
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,734
So, how was your
wedding night, Grace?

460
00:25:53,434 --> 00:25:54,800
Oh.

461
00:25:55,767 --> 00:25:59,500
It was just great.
Just great. I, uh...

462
00:26:01,201 --> 00:26:02,633
I sat in a dumbwaiter.

463
00:26:17,234 --> 00:26:19,167
(breathing heavily)

464
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,034
Alex, honey,
do you want some company?

465
00:26:51,667 --> 00:26:53,167
Oh, fuck me.

466
00:27:04,267 --> 00:27:06,001
How long is this gonna take?

467
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:08,734
How long
does this usually take?

468
00:27:08,834 --> 00:27:10,900
There is nothing usual
about this.

469
00:27:11,001 --> 00:27:13,834
It's only happened once
since I joined the family.

470
00:27:16,834 --> 00:27:19,167
Am I really supposed to know
how to use this thing?

471
00:27:23,201 --> 00:27:24,301
Oh, you know what?

472
00:27:24,401 --> 00:27:25,633
I'm just gonna
make a quick pit stop.

473
00:27:25,734 --> 00:27:27,267
I've got a nervous stomach.

474
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,034
You know I've never
liked you, right?

475
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,667
(chuckles) Uh...

476
00:27:40,401 --> 00:27:41,434
All right.

477
00:27:41,834 --> 00:27:43,234
That's enough of this.

478
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,201

00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,234
- I nearly pissed myself.
- I know.

487
00:28:50,334 --> 00:28:52,134
- You need to listen to me very carefully.
- CLARA: Georgie.

488
00:28:52,234 --> 00:28:55,600
- Shit. Come with me.
- Wait. What are we doing?

489
00:28:57,234 --> 00:29:00,368
- Get down. Grab your dress, grab your dress.
- Okay. Jesus.

499
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,067
Daddy, come see what I mean...

500
00:29:43,167 --> 00:29:45,533
- Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:50,934
Oh, Jesus Christ.

503
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:53,101
This is Clara.

504
00:29:53,201 --> 00:29:54,600
DANIEL: Does she look
like she's wearing

505
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,800
a giant, white
wedding dress, Emilie?

506
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,834
TONY: Why did you shoot her in the
face, sweetheart?

507
00:29:58,934 --> 00:30:01,401
You're supposed to maim her.
She needs to be alive for the ritual.

508
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,468
EMILIE:
I don't know.

509
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:04,034
- BECKY: I heard a shot.
- Yeah.

510
00:30:05,001 --> 00:30:05,867
Oh.

511
00:30:05,967 --> 00:30:07,600
Well, if she dies,
does this count?

512
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:11,001
Of course it does not count.
It must be the bride.

513
00:30:11,401 --> 00:30:12,734
DANIEL:
Well, what do we do now?

514
00:30:12,834 --> 00:30:14,533
TONY: Well, I don't know.
I'm... I'm thinking.

515
00:30:14,633 --> 00:30:17,600
Clara, hey.

516
00:30:18,034 --> 00:30:20,434
It's gonna be okay.

517
00:30:20,533 --> 00:30:21,633
(coughs, gags)

518
00:30:21,734 --> 00:30:24,301

519
00:30:24,401 --> 00:30:25,434
DANIEL:
Come on, let's take a walk.

520
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:27,134
EMILIE:
She's gonna die, guys.

521
00:30:27,633 --> 00:30:29,034
DANIEL:
Walk it off.

522
00:30:31,633 --> 00:30:34,667
So, what do we do with her?

523
00:30:34,767 --> 00:30:37,134
Move her.
We don't want Grace to see.

524
00:30:37,234 --> 00:30:38,834
Give me the fucking lanterns.

525
00:30:39,767 --> 00:30:41,334
TONY: Okay. Call it.

526
00:30:41,434 --> 00:30:42,533
(coin clinks)

527
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:44,368
- HELENE: Heads.
- TONY: Heads it is.

528
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:46,368
- HELENE: You get the legs.
- TONY: Okay.

529
00:30:46,468 --> 00:30:48,201
- Hold on.
- (grunting)

530
00:30:49,533 --> 00:30:52,567
HELENE: It's slipping. Yeah, good.
Oh, good. Okay. Go.

531
00:30:53,734 --> 00:30:55,667
TONY:
She was my favorite.

532
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,101
Wait here. Don't move.

533
00:31:04,567 --> 00:31:08,101
Okay, sweetie, you gotta get up.
We gotta get you out of here right now.

534
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:09,500
Okay. Stand up, here we go.

535
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,267
Okay. Okay, grab...
grab your phone. Grab the keys.

536
00:31:13,001 --> 00:31:14,834
Fuck. Shit.

537
00:31:14,934 --> 00:31:17,001
Okay. Stevens must've
taken the phone, so...

538
00:31:17,101 --> 00:31:19,468
- Alex, what the fuck?
- You're gonna have to run, okay?

539
00:31:19,567 --> 00:31:22,201
Hide and seek.
You pulled the one bad card.

540
00:31:23,267 --> 00:31:26,934
They think... They think they
have to kill you before sunrise.

541
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:29,034
- What the fuck?
- Follow me.

542
00:31:31,567 --> 00:31:32,401
EMILIE: One sec!

543
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,967
I forgot my gun.

544
00:31:36,301 --> 00:31:37,567
Okay.

545
00:31:37,667 --> 00:31:39,468
Okay, girl, no more fuckups.

546
00:31:39,567 --> 00:31:42,267
You're a winner.
You got that? (sniffs)

547
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:45,134
(sniffs, squeals)

548
00:31:45,234 --> 00:31:47,834
(breathing heavily)

549
00:31:51,334 --> 00:31:52,600
- Okay, you have your shoes?
- Alex.

550
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,967
Honey, I need you
to put on your shoes.

551
00:31:54,067 --> 00:31:56,067
No, Alex, Alex,
what the fuck is going on?

552
00:31:56,167 --> 00:31:58,034
I need you to put
your shoes on. Right now.

553
00:31:58,134 --> 00:32:01,167
- (panting)
- Okay, here we go. Here we go.

554
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,934
Okay.

555
00:32:12,767 --> 00:32:15,600
They think that
if they don't kill you,

556
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,900
something very bad
will happen to the family.

557
00:32:18,001 --> 00:32:22,267
Now... I had to play along
so that I can get you out.

558
00:32:22,368 --> 00:32:25,967
But the house is on lock down right
now, so it's gonna be really tricky.

559
00:32:26,067 --> 00:32:29,234
You knew what would happen
if I pulled that card.

560
00:32:29,334 --> 00:32:31,201
- I didn't think they'd actually go through with it.
- Fucking knew!

561
00:32:31,301 --> 00:32:33,234
No one ever pulls that.
It never fucking happens.

562
00:32:33,334 --> 00:32:35,368
- Yeah, but you knew about it!
- No, no, I didn't.

563
00:32:35,468 --> 00:32:37,767
(whispering, faint)

564
00:32:39,533 --> 00:32:42,201
- MAN (on phone): <i>I'm Richard Babis.</i>
- MAN 2: <i>And I'm Charlie.</i>

565
00:32:42,301 --> 00:32:43,667
<i>And today's segment is called</i>

566
00:32:43,767 --> 00:32:45,800
<i>"Getting to know
your crossbow."</i>

567
00:32:47,001 --> 00:32:49,600
Oh, fuck. I really...
I thought it was safe.

568
00:32:53,734 --> 00:32:55,967
But if I didn't
pull a card at all, then...

569
00:32:56,067 --> 00:32:58,234
Then your crazy family
wouldn't be trying to...

570
00:32:58,334 --> 00:33:00,867
- Oh, my God, they're gonna kill me.
- No, then we'd both be dead.

571
00:33:03,101 --> 00:33:05,600
When you marry into this
family you have to play a game.

572
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,368
And if you don't, you die.

573
00:33:07,468 --> 00:33:10,500
I know that sounds crazy,
but you have to believe me, it is real.

574
00:33:11,434 --> 00:33:13,001
It happened to my great-uncle.

575
00:33:13,101 --> 00:33:15,867
He got married, he didn't play a
game, next morning he died.

576
00:33:15,967 --> 00:33:18,134
His wife too. Same thing
happened to my cousin Rachel.

577
00:33:18,234 --> 00:33:21,734
Same thing happened to a bunch of people
that I never even met before. You just...

578
00:33:24,034 --> 00:33:25,201
You have to play.

579
00:33:27,067 --> 00:33:30,867
You said your family
was... fucked-up,

580
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:33,567
- but you didn't say psycho killers.
- I know.

581
00:33:33,667 --> 00:33:39,567
- You... you brought me here, you didn't warn me.
- You wanted to get married.

582
00:33:39,667 --> 00:33:41,468
- So it's my fucking fault?
- No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

583
00:33:41,567 --> 00:33:43,533
- Are you fucking serious?
- Shh.

584
00:33:43,633 --> 00:33:45,001
- We could've eloped.
- I know.

585
00:33:45,101 --> 00:33:47,101
- We could've...
- No, no. There are rules.

586
00:33:47,201 --> 00:33:48,368
You can't just elope.

587
00:33:48,468 --> 00:33:49,600
You... you have to have
the wedding here,

588
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,267
and you have to play
the fucking game.

589
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,867
(sighs)

590
00:33:54,234 --> 00:33:57,667
You didn't even fucking talk to me.
You could've told me. We could've...

591
00:33:58,867 --> 00:34:01,201
- Just...
- If I told you, you would've left.

592
00:34:09,533 --> 00:34:11,900
And if I didn't propose,
you would've left.

593
00:34:14,401 --> 00:34:16,334
You're everything to me,
and I promise you

594
00:34:16,434 --> 00:34:18,500
I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?

595
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,201
All right?
So just listen to me.

596
00:34:21,301 --> 00:34:22,900
You just need to go

597
00:34:23,001 --> 00:34:24,368
straight down this hallway until
you get to the service kitchen.

598
00:34:24,468 --> 00:34:26,001
I'm gonna go down
to the security room.

599
00:34:26,101 --> 00:34:28,700
I'm gonna unlock all the doors.
I'm gonna unlock all the doors.

600
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,101
- No. Don't fucking leave me.
- Then you just fucking run.

601
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:32,201
I have to. Honey, I have to.

602
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,134
Just... just stay inside the
walls until you get to the kit...

603
00:34:35,234 --> 00:34:38,001
Hey. Hey. You can do this.
Where you going?

604
00:34:39,001 --> 00:34:40,834
Straight
and then, um, kitchen.

605
00:34:40,934 --> 00:34:42,967
To the kitchen.
Good. Good. Hey. Hey.

606
00:34:43,533 --> 00:34:45,101
You're gonna make it.
It's gonna be okay.

607
00:34:45,434 --> 00:34:47,101
- I love you.
- I love you.

608
00:34:49,001 --> 00:34:49,834
Go. Go.

609
00:34:49,934 --> 00:34:52,267
- (panting)
- (footsteps departing)

610
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:54,034
Okay.

611
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:55,034
Fuck.

612
00:34:56,267 --> 00:34:58,867
(panting)

613
00:34:58,967 --> 00:35:00,134
Okay.

614
00:35:24,034 --> 00:35:25,567
(dress snags)

615
00:35:33,867 --> 00:35:34,900
(grunts)

616
00:36:04,201 --> 00:36:05,267
Fuck.

617
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:10,067
Oh, hey. Any sign of her?

618
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:12,101
No. She could be anywhere.

619
00:36:12,201 --> 00:36:14,533
(door opens)

620
00:36:19,067 --> 00:36:20,500
Found her.

621
00:36:25,134 --> 00:36:26,734
(Emilie screams)

622
00:36:27,234 --> 00:36:28,934
DANIEL: Jesus! Fuck!

623
00:36:29,034 --> 00:36:30,001
Goddammit!

624
00:36:30,101 --> 00:36:34,201
Emilie, aim for
the center of gravity!

625
00:36:34,301 --> 00:36:35,500
I don't know what I'm doing!

626
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,567
(panting)

627
00:36:42,134 --> 00:36:44,834
(grunting)

628
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,001
Help, help, help, help.

629
00:36:58,101 --> 00:36:59,167
Fuck.

630
00:37:05,967 --> 00:37:07,767
Shh.

631
00:37:15,101 --> 00:37:16,234
(panting)

632
00:37:21,567 --> 00:37:23,134
I just came to get a drink.

633
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,734
(cork pops)

634
00:37:34,767 --> 00:37:36,167
I have to call the others.

635
00:37:36,267 --> 00:37:38,134
(pouring)

636
00:37:38,234 --> 00:37:39,567
No, you don't.

637
00:37:40,201 --> 00:37:41,167
No.

638
00:37:41,267 --> 00:37:43,067
You can help me. Please.

639
00:37:44,567 --> 00:37:46,667
(sighs)
This doesn't end well for you.

640
00:37:47,834 --> 00:37:50,167
I just don't wanna be
the one to serve you up.

641
00:37:50,834 --> 00:37:53,967
Daniel, I'm begging you.

642
00:37:57,967 --> 00:37:59,934
I'm really sorry
about all this.

643
00:38:00,034 --> 00:38:03,201
It's true what they say:
The rich really are different.

644
00:38:06,101 --> 00:38:08,267
I'll give you
a ten-second head start.

645
00:38:10,267 --> 00:38:11,500
Daniel.

646
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:25,633
One, one thousand.

647
00:38:27,468 --> 00:38:28,967
Two, one thousand.

648
00:38:30,867 --> 00:38:32,867
<i>Two and a half, one thousand.</i>

649
00:38:38,368 --> 00:38:40,600
(yelling):
She's in the study!

650
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,633
MAN (on phone): <i>Point
the weapon away from you.</i>

651
00:38:54,067 --> 00:38:55,167
You lost her?

652
00:38:56,533 --> 00:38:57,867
Indeed.

653
00:38:58,301 --> 00:38:59,734
You're pathetic.

654
00:39:00,533 --> 00:39:01,834
Indeed.

655
00:39:03,767 --> 00:39:05,934
Could you at least
pretend to care?

656
00:39:06,034 --> 00:39:11,034
Oh, I'm sure you'll find her and
kill her with or without my help.

657
00:39:11,633 --> 00:39:14,900
You know, something did
occur to me, though.

658
00:39:15,001 --> 00:39:18,101
Alex may have been wrong
to keep Grace in the dark...

659
00:39:18,967 --> 00:39:21,101
but do you remember
how you reacted

660
00:39:21,201 --> 00:39:22,900
when I told you about this?

661
00:39:23,167 --> 00:39:24,667
You didn't fucking blink.

662
00:39:25,267 --> 00:39:29,201
I mean, you couldn't wait
to sign your soul away.

663
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,500
You know where I came from

664
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,700
and what my life
was like before.

665
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,301
I'd rather be dead
than lose all of this.

666
00:39:40,401 --> 00:39:43,201
Well... from your lips.

667
00:39:44,368 --> 00:39:46,533
(footsteps approaching)

668
00:39:52,167 --> 00:39:54,700
- Where is she?
- I'm afraid you just missed her.

669
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,800
Tony, Alex got out.
I'm so sorry.

670
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,834
Goddammit.

671
00:39:58,934 --> 00:40:00,900
Who's the fuckup now, right?

672
00:40:02,201 --> 00:40:03,468
Still me?

673
00:40:03,867 --> 00:40:05,434
Did you find her? Is it over?

674
00:40:05,533 --> 00:40:06,900
No, it's not over.

675
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:08,667
And now she knows
what's going on.

676
00:40:08,767 --> 00:40:10,767
Oh, but Emilie shot Clara
in the face.

677
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:13,001
So she's dead.
That's just a side note.

678
00:40:13,101 --> 00:40:14,267
Clara's dead?

679
00:40:15,301 --> 00:40:16,600
She was my favorite.

680
00:40:17,134 --> 00:40:18,934
Cock! I forgot my gun.

681
00:40:19,301 --> 00:40:21,434
Daddy, I forgot my gun.
I suck.

682
00:40:21,533 --> 00:40:23,134
- Oh, it's okay.
- I suck!

683
00:40:23,234 --> 00:40:24,368
You don't suck, sweetheart.

684
00:40:24,468 --> 00:40:26,500
Here, hon, why don't you
just use mine.

685
00:40:28,101 --> 00:40:31,767
Mr. Le Domas, Mr. Le Domas,
I just saw her running...

686
00:40:32,633 --> 00:40:33,767
(body thuds)

687
00:40:33,867 --> 00:40:35,633
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God.

688
00:40:35,734 --> 00:40:37,434
- (Emilie scoffs)
- (Fitch screams)

689
00:40:37,767 --> 00:40:40,734
- Okay, now...
- Why does this always happen to me?

690
00:40:40,834 --> 00:40:42,368
- Come on!
- Okay. Calm down.

691
00:40:42,468 --> 00:40:43,734
Baby.

692
00:40:44,834 --> 00:40:47,533
- Yeah, okay, that's okay, honey. Come on.
- Don't be mad.

693
00:40:47,633 --> 00:40:51,034
Let's go take a walk, find you an
edible, even you out a little bit.

694
00:40:51,434 --> 00:40:55,700
Maybe we'll find the other one that's
still alive to clean that shit up.

695
00:40:56,533 --> 00:40:57,934
So, wait.

696
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,067
Does the help count?

697
00:41:00,167 --> 00:41:01,301
HELENE: No!

698
00:41:01,401 --> 00:41:03,533
Why does everyone
keep asking that?

699
00:41:03,967 --> 00:41:06,167
- We must...
- (servant gasps, groaning)

700
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,500
- We must...
- (gurgling)

701
00:41:21,867 --> 00:41:24,201
- (axe thuds)
- Oh, what the fuck!

702
00:41:26,368 --> 00:41:29,468
We must kill the bride
by dawn.

703
00:41:29,567 --> 00:41:31,600
We're fucked.
I mean, we are so fucked.

704
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,734
Calm down. Work the problem.

705
00:41:33,834 --> 00:41:36,700
We should use
the security cameras.

706
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,600
You have no respect
for tradition.

707
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,767
TONY:
No, she's right.

708
00:41:39,867 --> 00:41:41,267
Don't you think
Great-Grandfather

709
00:41:41,368 --> 00:41:43,101
would've used the security
cameras if he had them?

710
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:45,101
I mean, it's not tradition that
he was born before cameras.

711
00:41:45,201 --> 00:41:46,401
That's... that's stupid.

712
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,500
Exactly.

713
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,201
Times change.

714
00:41:49,301 --> 00:41:52,301
Speaking of which, may I please
use a weapon made this century?

715
00:41:52,633 --> 00:41:54,301
- I have a gun in my purse.
- You do?

716
00:41:54,401 --> 00:41:56,967
No. No. We use Great-Grandfather's.
That's tradition.

717
00:41:57,067 --> 00:41:58,834
You pick and choose.
Pick and choose.

718
00:41:58,934 --> 00:42:01,401
At least you're not making us
wear those fucking masks.

719
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,667
Oh, no. That was Dad's idea.

720
00:42:04,134 --> 00:42:05,301
It was the '80s.

721
00:42:05,967 --> 00:42:09,967
- Our reverence must not wane.
- Goddammit, Sis!

722
00:42:10,067 --> 00:42:14,700
If we don't find her and perform the
ritual before dawn, we're all dead.

723
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,934
BECKY: Tony,
take Daniel and turn on the cameras.

724
00:42:18,034 --> 00:42:20,767
Everyone else fan out,
and somebody find Alex.

725
00:42:58,834 --> 00:43:00,500
- Jesus.
- (door opens)

726
00:43:02,567 --> 00:43:03,767
(lock clicks)

727
00:43:05,734 --> 00:43:07,600
Fucking shit. Fuck.

728
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,600
(handle rattles)

729
00:43:18,967 --> 00:43:20,001
Come on, Alex.

730
00:43:28,368 --> 00:43:30,767
- (trigger clicks)
- (grunts)

731
00:43:30,867 --> 00:43:34,533
(whistling Tchaikovsky's
"1812 Overture")

732
00:43:36,267 --> 00:43:37,533
Monitors. Monitors.

733
00:43:38,834 --> 00:43:42,567
(whistling continues)

734
00:44:11,468 --> 00:44:12,500
Okay.

735
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,201
Oh, shit.

736
00:44:14,301 --> 00:44:15,800
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

737
00:44:16,633 --> 00:44:19,900
(whistling continues)

738
00:44:23,867 --> 00:44:26,434
Your aunt always
gets lost in the details.

739
00:44:26,533 --> 00:44:28,267
Who gives a shit
how we find her?

740
00:44:28,368 --> 00:44:30,067
Oh. I agree completely.

741
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:31,334
Yeah.

742
00:44:31,434 --> 00:44:33,533
- Looks like we're not the only ones.
- What?

743
00:44:33,633 --> 00:44:35,700
Someone turned on the cameras.

744
00:44:36,468 --> 00:44:37,500
Alex.

745
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,767
Open doors.
Open fucking doors.

746
00:44:42,167 --> 00:44:45,567
(whistling continues)

747
00:44:53,234 --> 00:44:54,500

(Stevens vocalizing

Oh, fuck.

754
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:36,533
Move.

755
00:46:40,533 --> 00:46:42,001
I'm afraid I can't do that.

756
00:46:47,134 --> 00:46:49,134
(trigger clicks)

757
00:46:50,234 --> 00:46:52,267
The ammunition
is display only.

758
00:46:53,401 --> 00:46:56,201
Now, did you really think
I would be stupid enough to...

759
00:46:56,301 --> 00:46:57,267
(screaming)

760
00:46:57,368 --> 00:46:58,267
Fuck yeah!

761
00:47:00,334 --> 00:47:02,700
(both grunting)

762
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,234
- (knocking)
- TONY: Open the door, Alex!

763
00:47:05,334 --> 00:47:07,001
STEVENS: She's in here!

764
00:47:08,201 --> 00:47:11,134
- (knocking continues)
- TONY: Open the goddamn door!

765
00:47:16,101 --> 00:47:18,034
Goddammit, Alex!

766
00:47:19,633 --> 00:47:21,101
Open this door!

767
00:47:23,834 --> 00:47:25,267
ALEX: No, no. Hey, no!

768
00:47:25,368 --> 00:47:27,800
TONY: If you're not gonna help
us, get the hell out.

769
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,533
You fucking leave her alone!

770
00:47:31,633 --> 00:47:33,134
You understand me?

771
00:47:33,234 --> 00:47:35,101
- Alex!
- That's my wife!

772
00:47:35,201 --> 00:47:36,734
DANIEL: Hey.

773
00:47:37,201 --> 00:47:38,234
Alex.

774
00:47:39,301 --> 00:47:41,201
Alex,
you don't have to do this.

775
00:47:41,301 --> 00:47:42,533
Alex.

776
00:47:44,434 --> 00:47:46,700
Okay. (grunts)

777
00:47:47,101 --> 00:47:48,567
Oh, God. Oh, God.

778
00:47:48,667 --> 00:47:50,667
(Tony wheezing)

779
00:48:23,593 --> 00:48:24,859
I know, I know.

780
00:48:25,226 --> 00:48:27,292
- I know.
- You gotta help me. You gotta help me.

781
00:48:27,392 --> 00:48:29,925
- She's everything to me.
- I know. We'll get her out.

782
00:48:30,025 --> 00:48:31,658
- Okay, thank you. Please.
- I promise.

783
00:48:31,758 --> 00:48:32,892
(both grunt)

784
00:48:40,226 --> 00:48:43,259
- Whose side are you on?
- I distracted him, didn't I?

785
00:48:44,292 --> 00:48:45,326
Call it.

786
00:48:45,692 --> 00:48:47,292
Oh, fucking who cares?

787
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:49,825
Tails. You take the head.

788
00:48:50,459 --> 00:48:51,925
Goddammit.

789
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:56,925
- Wait, wait. I gotta get my gun.
- Just come back for it.

790
00:49:00,892 --> 00:49:02,126
TONY: Move your ass!

791
00:49:02,226 --> 00:49:04,326
DANIEL: I'm carrying
the heavy part, Father.

792
00:49:04,426 --> 00:49:07,859
Years of alcohol and drug
abuse have taken a toll.

793
00:49:12,593 --> 00:49:13,959
(both gasp)

794
00:49:14,692 --> 00:49:16,159
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

795
00:49:16,925 --> 00:49:19,326
- I don't understand what's going on.
- Okay. Okay.

796
00:49:19,426 --> 00:49:20,658
I need you to be quiet, okay?

797
00:49:20,758 --> 00:49:22,292
Look, I'm not even a maid.

798
00:49:22,658 --> 00:49:24,593
Mr. Le Domas,
he just likes the way I dance.

799
00:49:24,692 --> 00:49:26,326
Okay, let's swap places.

800
00:49:26,426 --> 00:49:27,559
Yeah, cause they're looking for
me, they're not looking for you.

801
00:49:27,658 --> 00:49:29,359
So, come on. Come on.

802
00:49:29,459 --> 00:49:30,725
- Please.
- She's over here!

803
00:49:30,825 --> 00:49:33,059
- She's here! She's over here!
- No, no, no, no.

804
00:49:34,192 --> 00:49:37,292
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Ow, ow, ow!

805
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,426
Help me, please.

806
00:49:40,526 --> 00:49:41,725
- Shit.
- Please.

807
00:49:41,825 --> 00:49:43,892
(machinery grinding)

808
00:49:43,992 --> 00:49:45,625
(gasping)

809
00:49:46,292 --> 00:49:47,392
(loud crunch)

810
00:49:50,593 --> 00:49:51,825
Shit.

811
00:49:59,426 --> 00:50:01,658
(footsteps approaching)

812
00:50:11,593 --> 00:50:12,859
- BECKY: Tony.
- Yeah?

813
00:50:12,959 --> 00:50:14,625
- What are you doing?
- Well...

814
00:50:14,725 --> 00:50:16,925
We're trying to
bring him back to us.

815
00:50:17,459 --> 00:50:18,758
STEVENS: Sir.

816
00:50:20,426 --> 00:50:21,658
Oh, man.

817
00:50:22,025 --> 00:50:23,025
Ow.

818
00:50:23,126 --> 00:50:25,593
I was unable to repair
the security system.

819
00:50:25,692 --> 00:50:27,892
The doors and windows
remain unlocked.

820
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:29,925
Oh.

821
00:50:30,025 --> 00:50:32,825
And I'm afraid that
Dora has been crushed, sir.

822
00:50:33,292 --> 00:50:34,493
By the dumbwaiter.

823
00:50:34,593 --> 00:50:36,226
And then there were none.

824
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:37,792
Jesus Christ.

825
00:50:37,892 --> 00:50:39,426
She's taking us all out.

826
00:50:39,526 --> 00:50:41,526
- How's she doing this?
- Sweetheart.

827
00:50:41,625 --> 00:50:43,192
It doesn't make sense, Becky.

828
00:50:43,292 --> 00:50:44,658
(stammers)

829
00:50:44,758 --> 00:50:47,059
- She's a little blonde twig, and I don't...
- Tony.

830
00:50:49,725 --> 00:50:51,359
Take a minute.

831
00:50:51,459 --> 00:50:53,326
But just a minute.

832
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:56,992
We can't let her get out.
We've got to guard the doors.

833
00:51:00,526 --> 00:51:02,292
He lost his way.

834
00:51:05,593 --> 00:51:07,359
You should never have
let him leave us.

835
00:51:07,459 --> 00:51:08,593
TONY: Excuse me?

836
00:51:08,925 --> 00:51:11,526
HELENE: He and I have
always been so much alike.

837
00:51:11,625 --> 00:51:13,059
I knew the girl
would draw that card,

838
00:51:13,159 --> 00:51:15,326
and that he would face
the same choice I faced.

839
00:51:15,426 --> 00:51:16,692
TONY: Horse shit.

840
00:51:16,792 --> 00:51:18,892
None of us expected
to be doing this tonight.

841
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:20,559
I got a tee time at eight.

842
00:51:20,658 --> 00:51:21,725
And, in case
you didn't notice,

843
00:51:21,825 --> 00:51:23,126
it wasn't much
of a choice for him.

844
00:51:23,226 --> 00:51:26,059
He's been helping her
from the get-go.

845
00:51:26,758 --> 00:51:28,226
- He hates us.
- HELENE: No.

846
00:51:28,925 --> 00:51:31,226
He's simply afraid
of who he truly is.

847
00:51:31,326 --> 00:51:32,825
Like I was.

848
00:51:33,326 --> 00:51:35,326
You'll never know
how it felt that night

849
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:39,892
<i>to be told that the only man
that I'd ever loved had to die.</i>

850
00:51:39,992 --> 00:51:41,658
<i>But I should not have
fought it.</i>

851
00:51:41,758 --> 00:51:43,825
I should have
killed Charles myself.

852
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:46,892
There's still time for Alex
to do the right thing.

853
00:51:46,992 --> 00:51:49,292
He only has to
accept the truth.

854
00:51:49,392 --> 00:51:51,326
Uh, um, what truth is that?

855
00:51:51,426 --> 00:51:57,025
That he is meant to lead
this family, not run from it.

856
00:51:57,925 --> 00:51:59,959
TONY: He's hated our
pact from the very start.

857
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:01,758
He's the good son.
Do you remember that?

858
00:52:01,859 --> 00:52:03,859
Then why is he
the only one of us

859
00:52:03,959 --> 00:52:07,292
who has ever seen
Mr. Le Bail in his chair?

860
00:52:07,392 --> 00:52:08,992
Good God. He was five.

861
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:11,126
He was probably,
I don't know, dreaming it.

862
00:52:11,226 --> 00:52:12,825
Or maybe he made it up.

863
00:52:15,392 --> 00:52:17,259
Well, if you say so.

864
00:52:21,925 --> 00:52:23,792
(footsteps departing)

865
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,801
- (phone chimes)
- (Fitch scoffs)

866
00:53:01,434 --> 00:53:03,534
"What up, dawg?" (chuckles)

867
00:53:03,634 --> 00:53:04,734
Idiot.

868
00:53:05,067 --> 00:53:06,300
Not much.

869
00:53:07,133 --> 00:53:08,767
Family shit.

870
00:53:10,067 --> 00:53:11,300
(soft thud)

871
00:53:13,133 --> 00:53:14,534
(phone chimes)

872
00:53:22,767 --> 00:53:25,133
(panting)

873
00:53:28,434 --> 00:53:30,033
(kisses, laughs)

874
00:54:02,601 --> 00:54:03,701
(door closes)

875
00:54:06,434 --> 00:54:08,434
- (goat bleating)
- (door opens)

876
00:54:09,667 --> 00:54:11,000
(door closes)

877
00:54:11,434 --> 00:54:13,501
(footsteps)

878
00:54:18,834 --> 00:54:21,067
(bleating continues)

879
00:54:40,601 --> 00:54:42,100
Georgie?

880
00:54:43,801 --> 00:54:45,467
Oh, thank God. Okay.

881
00:54:45,567 --> 00:54:48,834
Okay, listen, I know this is
really, really scary, but...

882
00:54:48,934 --> 00:54:51,367
(Grace gasps, screams)

883
00:54:58,701 --> 00:55:00,000
(grunts)

884
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:06,100
- (goat bleats)
- (shrieks)

885
00:55:09,734 --> 00:55:12,033
(coughing, gasping)

886
00:55:12,734 --> 00:55:14,767
- (coughs)
- (flies buzzing)

887
00:55:16,334 --> 00:55:17,434
(gasps)

888
00:55:21,601 --> 00:55:23,200
(retches)

889
00:55:26,934 --> 00:55:29,133
(gasping, panting)

890
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:41,601
(screams)

891
00:55:41,701 --> 00:55:42,734
Fuck.

892
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:55,167
Shit.

893
00:55:57,801 --> 00:55:59,033
Fuck.

894
00:56:26,501 --> 00:56:27,567
(gasps)

895
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:34,434
(panting)

896
00:56:42,734 --> 00:56:44,501
(screams)

897
00:56:45,634 --> 00:56:46,667
Fuck.

898
00:56:53,667 --> 00:56:56,133
(groaning)

899
00:57:05,067 --> 00:57:06,734
(screams)

900
00:57:30,534 --> 00:57:32,701
(whimpering)

901
00:57:50,901 --> 00:57:53,000
You little fucker!

902
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,534
I got you.

903
00:58:14,634 --> 00:58:15,667
(cocks crossbow)

904
00:58:16,801 --> 00:58:18,467
I got you, bitch.

905
00:58:21,801 --> 00:58:23,067
(bird screeches)

906
00:58:23,601 --> 00:58:24,634
Fuck!

907
00:58:30,467 --> 00:58:33,334
She's outside, running
towards the north fence.

908
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:35,200
I'll get the others.

909
00:58:54,234 --> 00:58:56,334
(grunting, panting)

910
00:59:10,367 --> 00:59:12,367
(grunting)

911
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:17,334
(vehicle approaching)

912
00:59:18,234 --> 00:59:20,701
(screams) Help me!

913
00:59:20,801 --> 00:59:23,067
Please help!

914
00:59:35,868 --> 00:59:37,234
Help. Please help me.

915
00:59:37,567 --> 00:59:38,601
Help!

916
00:59:48,601 --> 00:59:50,234
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

917
00:59:50,634 --> 00:59:51,767
(screams)

918
00:59:54,634 --> 00:59:55,601
Help! Wait, stop.

919
00:59:55,701 --> 00:59:57,033
Please, please help me.

920
00:59:57,133 --> 00:59:58,634
Oh, thank God.
Thank you, thank you.

921
00:59:58,734 --> 01:00:01,300
- DRIVER: Get the fuck out of the road.
- Please wait.

922
01:00:03,367 --> 01:00:06,267
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

923
01:00:06,868 --> 01:00:08,634
You fucking animal.

924
01:00:08,734 --> 01:00:13,267
You piece of shit, little, tiny
dick-licker, fucking asshole, fucking I...

925
01:00:13,968 --> 01:00:16,167
(screams)

926
01:00:19,133 --> 01:00:20,667
Fucking rich people.

927
01:00:20,767 --> 01:00:24,501
(Stevens whistling
Tchaikovsky's "1812 Overture")

928
01:00:25,934 --> 01:00:27,300
Fuck.

929
01:00:50,901 --> 01:00:52,501
<i>She must've gone
into the woods.</i>

930
01:00:52,601 --> 01:00:54,400
<i>But don't worry, sir,
she won't get far.</i>

931
01:00:54,501 --> 01:00:56,100
<i>I'll find her.</i>

932
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,234
<i>And I'll fix the fence
tomorrow.</i>

933
01:00:58,701 --> 01:00:59,601
Well...

934
01:01:01,701 --> 01:01:02,968
she's out.

935
01:01:03,067 --> 01:01:04,601
(groans)

936
01:01:04,701 --> 01:01:05,734
Well...

937
01:01:06,801 --> 01:01:09,234
this was fun.

938
01:01:09,634 --> 01:01:14,200
What do you say we, uh, divvy up the
wedding gifts at brunch tomorrow?

939
01:01:14,701 --> 01:01:18,501
Do you think
that this is a fucking game?

940
01:01:19,601 --> 01:01:20,634
DANIEL: Yes.

941
01:01:21,033 --> 01:01:23,067
Hide and seek, remember?

942
01:01:23,501 --> 01:01:30,300
Do you realize that if she lives till
dawn, that we're all gonna die?

943
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,367
You all remember what happened
to the Van Horns, right?

944
01:01:34,467 --> 01:01:37,501
Um... didn't they just die
in a house fire?

945
01:01:37,601 --> 01:01:39,968
(scoffs) Yeah, that's what
the press told you, but they...

946
01:01:40,834 --> 01:01:43,834
You don't wanna know how
they really died. Trust me.

947
01:01:43,934 --> 01:01:45,634
No, you don't
fuck Mr. Le Bail.

948
01:01:45,734 --> 01:01:47,567
Mr. Le Bail fucks you.

949
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,634
You couldn't have negotiated
better terms, huh, Vic?

950
01:01:50,734 --> 01:01:52,167
You couldn't have, uh...

951
01:01:52,267 --> 01:01:54,300
Oh, I don't know,
maybe talked him down

952
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,634
on the whole
eradication clause?

953
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:58,234
Well, here's to you, fucker,

954
01:01:58,334 --> 01:02:00,567
because now
we are all fucking fucked!

955
01:02:00,667 --> 01:02:03,133
I think you made your point,
sweetheart, thank you.

956
01:02:03,767 --> 01:02:04,868
Oh, holy dick.

957
01:02:05,234 --> 01:02:07,801
Go wait for Stevens.
He might need your help.

958
01:02:07,901 --> 01:02:10,234
Not you two.
I want you out of the way.

959
01:02:10,334 --> 01:02:12,100
Take the maids
to the goat pit.

960
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:15,067
And, pumpkin,
try not to kill anyone else.

961
01:02:15,167 --> 01:02:18,000
Cleanup duty for the fuckups.

962
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:19,968
- No. Daddy.
- Come on, Em.

963
01:02:20,067 --> 01:02:21,400
Listen to your mother.

964
01:02:23,434 --> 01:02:27,200
Hey, hey. So, at what point
do we just cut and run?

965
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:28,334
Right?

966
01:02:28,734 --> 01:02:30,300
I mean, come on. Right?

967
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:36,100
Fuck you.

968
01:02:56,667 --> 01:02:57,734
Daniel!

969
01:02:58,901 --> 01:03:00,200
Daniel, help!

970
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,367
(grunts)

971
01:03:14,667 --> 01:03:15,734
(wood grinding)

972
01:03:21,801 --> 01:03:23,434
(singsong):
Grace.

973
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:25,434
(forcefully):
Grace.

974
01:03:30,767 --> 01:03:32,968
EMILIE: Why did she have
to pull "hide and seek"?

975
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:34,334
Do you think it's real?

976
01:03:34,434 --> 01:03:35,934
DANIEL:
What? That we'll implode

977
01:03:36,067 --> 01:03:38,701
or burst into flames, or
whatever, if we don't kill her?

978
01:03:39,033 --> 01:03:40,200
I don't know. Can you...

979
01:03:41,667 --> 01:03:42,767
All right, I'll...

980
01:03:43,634 --> 01:03:46,667
- I need, I need you to...
- I can't. If you barf, I'll barf.

981
01:03:48,868 --> 01:03:50,801
(both grunting)

982
01:03:50,901 --> 01:03:53,834
One, two, three.

983
01:03:53,934 --> 01:03:55,234
Three.

984
01:03:55,667 --> 01:03:57,501
(Emilie groans, whimpers)

985
01:03:57,601 --> 01:04:00,901
But you were with them the last time
they played hide and seek, weren't you?

986
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,067
Were you six, seven?

987
01:04:02,167 --> 01:04:03,667
Do you remember anything?

988
01:04:03,767 --> 01:04:04,801
I remember all of it.

989
01:04:05,267 --> 01:04:06,767
Alex was with me too.

990
01:04:07,067 --> 01:04:08,267
I tried to protect him.

991
01:04:08,367 --> 01:04:10,067
I don't know what he saw
or what he remembers.

992
01:04:10,167 --> 01:04:12,133
You always looked out for him.

993
01:04:12,234 --> 01:04:15,234
If that were true, I wouldn't
have let him marry Grace.

994
01:04:17,734 --> 01:04:19,334
He deserved a better brother.

995
01:04:24,133 --> 01:04:25,701
And we all deserve to die.

996
01:04:27,767 --> 01:04:29,400
My kids don't.

997
01:04:31,901 --> 01:04:33,200
GEORGIE: Mommy?

998
01:04:33,868 --> 01:04:35,067
Honey! Georgie.

999
01:04:35,334 --> 01:04:38,000
Are you okay?
What are you doing out here?

1000
01:04:38,734 --> 01:04:39,767
I...

1001
01:04:40,934 --> 01:04:42,868
I followed that lady
down here,

1002
01:04:42,968 --> 01:04:45,367
and I shot her
with that gun I found.

1003
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,234
Why would you do that?

1004
01:04:47,334 --> 01:04:48,667
That's what everyone else
was trying to do.

1005
01:04:48,767 --> 01:04:50,000
Oh, sweetie.

1006
01:04:50,634 --> 01:04:52,667
I am so proud of you.

1007
01:05:08,801 --> 01:05:10,300
(tires squealing)

1008
01:05:12,367 --> 01:05:13,267
Shit.

1009
01:05:16,567 --> 01:05:17,601
(laughs)

1010
01:05:21,033 --> 01:05:23,367
(Grace screams, gasping)

1011
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,100
(both grunting)

1012
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,100
(Grace screaming)

1013
01:05:33,701 --> 01:05:35,367
Come here, Grace!

1014
01:05:36,334 --> 01:05:37,767
(laughs)

1015
01:05:41,033 --> 01:05:43,033
(both scream)

1016
01:05:48,334 --> 01:05:51,400
(grunting, screaming)

1017
01:05:51,734 --> 01:05:53,100
Fucking asshole!

1018
01:06:00,567 --> 01:06:03,334
(Stevens groaning)

1019
01:06:09,033 --> 01:06:10,400
GRACE:
You motherfucker.

1020
01:06:16,634 --> 01:06:18,534
(gasping, panting)

1021
01:06:31,901 --> 01:06:33,100
(groans)

1022
01:06:43,934 --> 01:06:44,901
- (beeps)
- (line rings)

1023
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:45,868
(music plays)

1024
01:06:45,968 --> 01:06:47,734
WOMAN'S VOICE: <i>Thank you
for calling Trip Safe.</i>

1025
01:06:47,834 --> 01:06:49,634
<i>Please stay on the line
and you'll be connected</i>

1026
01:06:49,734 --> 01:06:52,000
<i>to the next available
representative.</i>

1027
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:55,100
REPRESENTATIVE: <i>Good evening. This is
Justin. Your call may be monitored...</i>

1028
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,834
People are trying to kill me.
Can you please help me?

1029
01:06:57,934 --> 01:06:59,534
<i>Uh, yes, I can help you
with that.</i>

1030
01:06:59,634 --> 01:07:01,334
<i>Um, do you need
medical assistance, or...</i>

1031
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:03,400
Can you call the police,
please?

1032
01:07:03,501 --> 01:07:05,667
<i>Yes. I'd be happy
to help you with that.</i>

1033
01:07:05,767 --> 01:07:07,701
(typing)

1034
01:07:07,801 --> 01:07:11,801
<i>Sorry. The computer's
acting up again.</i>

1035
01:07:11,901 --> 01:07:14,234
<i>(chuckles) Let me
just quickly reboot here.</i>

1036
01:07:14,334 --> 01:07:16,734
Justin,
just call the fucking police.

1037
01:07:16,834 --> 01:07:20,200
<i>Ma'am, it says here that
the car was reported stolen.</i>

1038
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:22,067
<i>I'm sorry,
but I have to shut it down.</i>

1039
01:07:22,167 --> 01:07:23,434
- No, what?
- (engine stalls)

1040
01:07:23,534 --> 01:07:25,868
No, what the fuck?
Are you fucking kidding me?

1041
01:07:25,968 --> 01:07:27,300
<i>It's company policy, ma'am.</i>

1042
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:28,901
- <i>There's nothing I can do.</i>
- No, no, no, please. Justin.

1043
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
<i>Just stay with the vehicle, ma'am.
Police are on their way.</i>

1044
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:32,434
Just start the fucking car!

1045
01:07:32,534 --> 01:07:35,000
- <i>'Kay, there's no need for profanity.</i>
- Start the car, Justin!

1046
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:38,434
<i>Jesus, there's nothing I can do.
My hands are tied.</i>

1047
01:07:45,868 --> 01:07:47,100
Justin.

1048
01:07:47,834 --> 01:07:49,367
Hello? Justin!

1049
01:07:49,467 --> 01:07:51,434
<i>Is there anything else
I can help you with?</i>

1050
01:07:51,534 --> 01:07:53,033
Yeah, you can go
fuck yourself, Justin!

1051
01:07:53,133 --> 01:07:56,667
<i>Okay. Thanks for using Trip Safe.
Have a great night.</i>

1052
01:07:56,767 --> 01:07:57,734
(beeps)

1053
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,801
Okay. You're okay,
you're okay, you're okay.

1054
01:08:01,901 --> 01:08:03,267
Police are on the way.

1055
01:08:05,434 --> 01:08:07,701
Police are on their way.
Everything's gonna be...

1056
01:08:07,801 --> 01:08:09,167
(gasps)

1057
01:08:20,934 --> 01:08:22,200
Good night, Grace.

1058
01:08:34,767 --> 01:08:37,167
Alex, is that you?

1059
01:08:37,634 --> 01:08:39,534
Hey. Hey, you're safe now.

1060
01:08:41,133 --> 01:08:42,367
We're leaving.

1061
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,734
(Tchaikovsky's "1812 Overture"
on speakers)

1062
01:08:57,834 --> 01:08:58,968
TONY:
<i>Where are you?</i>

1063
01:08:59,067 --> 01:09:01,133
We're approaching
the rear gate, sir.

1064
01:09:01,234 --> 01:09:02,701
<i>We'll be there shortly.</i>

1065
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:07,067
All right.
We are back in business.

1066
01:09:10,067 --> 01:09:13,133
(volume increases)

1067
01:09:13,767 --> 01:09:14,667
(laughs)

1068
01:09:21,367 --> 01:09:23,767
(cackles)

1069
01:09:30,634 --> 01:09:31,667
Tony.

1070
01:09:32,701 --> 01:09:36,601
(Tchaikovsky's "1812 Overture"
continues)

1071
01:09:41,133 --> 01:09:43,400
Hey, Stevens! Look behind you.

1072
01:09:43,868 --> 01:09:45,100
<i>Stevens!</i>

1073
01:09:47,234 --> 01:09:49,400
Turn down the fucking music,
you idiot!

1074
01:09:50,534 --> 01:09:51,901
- (thuds)
- Oh.

1075
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,234
(tires squealing)

1076
01:09:55,667 --> 01:09:57,033
- (thuds)
- Oh!

1077
01:09:57,133 --> 01:09:58,767
(Tchaikovsky's "1812 Overture"
continues)

1078
01:09:59,534 --> 01:10:01,067
(screams)

1079
01:10:01,767 --> 01:10:03,267
Oh, no.

1080
01:10:06,501 --> 01:10:08,734
(screaming)

1081
01:10:18,934 --> 01:10:20,567
(music ends)

1082
01:10:20,667 --> 01:10:21,634
Oh, fuck.

1083
01:10:21,734 --> 01:10:22,767
Fuck!

1084
01:10:29,434 --> 01:10:30,534
(Grace gasps)

1085
01:10:33,868 --> 01:10:35,734
- (seat belt unbuckles)
- (Grace gasps)

1086
01:10:38,534 --> 01:10:41,033
(grunting)

1087
01:10:52,601 --> 01:10:53,634
Déjà vu.

1088
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:59,400
It's funny, I... came out here
to escape the madness.

1089
01:11:01,601 --> 01:11:04,434
Thanks for crashing a car
into my tranquility.

1090
01:11:06,801 --> 01:11:08,033
Daniel.

1091
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:12,534
You don't wanna kill me.
You don't want me to die.

1092
01:11:13,734 --> 01:11:15,000
No, I don't.

1093
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:16,634
I like you, Grace.

1094
01:11:17,601 --> 01:11:20,200
So let me go. Okay?

1095
01:11:26,601 --> 01:11:27,667
I'm weak.

1096
01:11:30,734 --> 01:11:32,033
You're a good guy.

1097
01:11:32,601 --> 01:11:34,968
You're a really,
really, really good guy.

1098
01:11:35,067 --> 01:11:37,534
And Alex, Alex loves you.

1099
01:11:39,767 --> 01:11:41,234
And you love him.

1100
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:47,501
He's not gonna forgive you
if you do this.

1101
01:11:49,067 --> 01:11:50,734
Maybe not.

1102
01:11:50,834 --> 01:11:52,400
But at least he'll be alive.

1103
01:11:53,234 --> 01:11:56,868
I can't let my entire family
die because of you.

1104
01:11:56,968 --> 01:11:58,734
It's insane.

1105
01:11:59,834 --> 01:12:01,300
Can't you see it's insane?

1106
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:05,033
No one's gonna die...
No one, no one is gonna die.

1107
01:12:05,133 --> 01:12:07,701
And you can
do something about it.

1108
01:12:07,801 --> 01:12:09,300
It's bullshit!

1109
01:12:09,801 --> 01:12:11,033
DANIEL: No.

1110
01:12:11,133 --> 01:12:13,367
I am not who you think I am.

1111
01:12:13,868 --> 01:12:15,567
Alex is the one who got out.

1112
01:12:15,667 --> 01:12:20,400
If anyone was gonna save you,
it would've been him.

1113
01:12:27,567 --> 01:12:29,234
You can come out now.

1114
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:37,200
What, you knew I was here?

1115
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,567
I'm drunk, I'm not blind.

1116
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,200
TONY: Ooh, we gotta move.
Less than an hour till dawn.

1117
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:45,701
And we still need to
prepare her for the ritual.

1118
01:12:45,801 --> 01:12:47,667
(grunting)

1119
01:12:52,167 --> 01:12:54,501
(footsteps approaching)

1120
01:13:06,634 --> 01:13:08,267
Where's Grace?

1121
01:13:09,968 --> 01:13:11,701
She's indisposed.

1122
01:13:15,767 --> 01:13:18,534
You didn't think I was just
gonna let it happen, did you?

1123
01:13:23,334 --> 01:13:26,167
With family,
one hopes for the best.

1124
01:13:26,901 --> 01:13:28,534
The thing is...

1125
01:13:30,701 --> 01:13:32,534
I like her.

1126
01:13:34,334 --> 01:13:36,701
I don't wanna do this.

1127
01:13:36,968 --> 01:13:41,234
But we have to
protect the family.

1128
01:13:42,534 --> 01:13:43,567
If she dies...

1129
01:13:46,567 --> 01:13:48,100
I'll kill you.

1130
01:13:48,968 --> 01:13:51,367
(chuckles) Well...

1131
01:13:52,234 --> 01:13:54,467
then I suppose
I'm dead either way.

1132
01:13:54,934 --> 01:13:57,434
Yeah, and maybe it's a crock of
shit and nothing will happen.

1133
01:13:57,534 --> 01:13:58,567
Oh, please.

1134
01:13:59,133 --> 01:14:03,701
If you believed that, you wouldn't
have let her draw a card at all.

1135
01:14:13,133 --> 01:14:15,167
Why did you leave us, Alex?

1136
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:18,801
Oh, I don't know, Mom.

1137
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:24,234
I don't know. Maybe one night when I was
chanting and slicing the throat of a goat,

1138
01:14:24,334 --> 01:14:28,067
it occurred to me that that wasn't
a completely normal thing to do.

1139
01:14:29,968 --> 01:14:33,534
But, and this is
what scared me the most...

1140
01:14:35,167 --> 01:14:36,701
it felt normal.

1141
01:14:38,801 --> 01:14:40,033
It did.

1142
01:14:41,567 --> 01:14:45,367
And I realized that you'll
do pretty much anything...

1143
01:14:45,467 --> 01:14:48,234
if your family says it's okay.

1144
01:14:52,767 --> 01:14:54,334
And then I met Grace.

1145
01:14:56,334 --> 01:14:58,667
She's the opposite
of all of you.

1146
01:15:02,033 --> 01:15:03,634
She's good.

1147
01:15:06,234 --> 01:15:08,267
And she made me feel
like I could be good too.

1148
01:15:08,367 --> 01:15:13,300
So, if it comes down to
you or her, I choose her.

1149
01:15:18,033 --> 01:15:19,567
I don't believe you.

1150
01:15:22,334 --> 01:15:24,234
And I don't think
that you believe

1151
01:15:24,334 --> 01:15:27,167
that a girl that you've known
for a year and a half...

1152
01:15:28,067 --> 01:15:31,400
knows you better than I do.

1153
01:15:48,968 --> 01:15:53,601
Our family has a very special
friend named Mr. Le Bail.

1154
01:15:54,501 --> 01:15:59,868
Mr. Le Bail is the reason we
have all the nice things we have.

1155
01:15:59,968 --> 01:16:05,367
<i>But sometimes Mr. Le Bail wants
something from us in return.</i>

1156
01:16:05,467 --> 01:16:08,100
- (thunder rumbling)
- You got this, Fitch.

1157
01:16:08,734 --> 01:16:10,067
You got this, Fitch!

1158
01:16:10,167 --> 01:16:11,968
Don't be a bitch, Fitch.

1159
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:15,000
Don't be a bitch, Fitch.
You got this, bitch.

1160
01:16:18,667 --> 01:16:22,133
TONY: <i>I know tonight
didn't go as planned.</i>

1161
01:16:22,234 --> 01:16:25,033
<i>But I'll make it right,
Mr. Le Bail.</i>

1162
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:32,434
You'll see.

1163
01:16:52,501 --> 01:16:55,534
(thunder rumbling)

1164
01:17:00,434 --> 01:17:03,000
(man's voice echoing,
indistinct)

1165
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,267
(Grace gasping)

1166
01:17:11,968 --> 01:17:15,033
(Tony speaking Latin)

1167
01:17:15,133 --> 01:17:16,734
(Grace grunting)

1168
01:17:21,133 --> 01:17:23,467
(speaking Latin)

1169
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:32,033
(muffled screaming)

1170
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:45,400
(all reciting in Latin)

1171
01:17:50,601 --> 01:17:52,367
(all reciting in Latin)

1172
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:56,234
TONY: We renew our
pledge this night,

1173
01:17:56,868 --> 01:17:58,901
as our ancestors before us...

1174
01:17:59,701 --> 01:18:03,133
with this offering
of living flesh and blood.

1175
01:18:03,234 --> 01:18:05,501
(screaming continues)

1176
01:18:05,601 --> 01:18:09,100
- (Tony continues in Latin)
- (all reciting in Latin)

1177
01:18:13,601 --> 01:18:14,501
Hail...

1178
01:18:22,133 --> 01:18:24,167
- HELENE: Brother!
- (knife clatters on floor)

1179
01:18:24,267 --> 01:18:26,767
- (gagging, retching)
- (all retching)

1180
01:18:32,534 --> 01:18:33,934
Poisoned!

1181
01:18:34,033 --> 01:18:35,767
You son of a bitch!

1182
01:18:35,868 --> 01:18:37,367
EMILIE: Oh, God.

1183
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:44,801
What did you give us?

1184
01:18:44,901 --> 01:18:47,868
Stuff we poured on the maids.
White bottle, little red cap.

1185
01:18:47,968 --> 01:18:49,601
Hydrochloric acid!

1186
01:18:50,834 --> 01:18:52,467
DANIEL:
Come on, up and at 'em.

1187
01:19:01,868 --> 01:19:02,901
ALEX: Grace!

1188
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,033
- Did you... Did you just kill 'em?
- No, I just gave them a nip.

1189
01:19:07,133 --> 01:19:09,734
I Googled it. They'll shit weird
for a week, but they'll be fine.

1190
01:19:09,834 --> 01:19:12,234
- Don't worry, I'll get Alex out too.
- TONY: Find them!

1191
01:19:12,701 --> 01:19:14,100
HELENE: We don't have...

1192
01:19:17,033 --> 01:19:18,567
(footsteps)

1193
01:19:21,567 --> 01:19:23,234
I knew you'd help me.

1194
01:19:24,033 --> 01:19:25,100
I didn't.

1195
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,033
All I knew was, at some point,
somebody had to burn it all down.

1196
01:19:30,067 --> 01:19:31,601
Never thought it'd be me.

1197
01:19:31,701 --> 01:19:33,167
CHARITY: Daniel.

1198
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,100
Get out of the way.

1199
01:19:46,033 --> 01:19:47,267
Charity.

1200
01:19:48,567 --> 01:19:51,000
(sighs, sniffles)

1201
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:53,567
You really don't care
if I die.

1202
01:19:54,234 --> 01:19:56,167
- You don't have to...
- (gunshot)

1203
01:19:58,367 --> 01:19:59,400
(coughs)

1204
01:20:01,968 --> 01:20:03,501
(gunshots)

1205
01:20:03,601 --> 01:20:06,100
(both grunting)

1206
01:20:06,534 --> 01:20:08,400
(trigger clicks)

1207
01:20:11,534 --> 01:20:13,234
(coughs, gags)

1208
01:20:13,334 --> 01:20:15,634
Daniel. Daniel. Daniel.

1209
01:20:17,801 --> 01:20:19,067
Go.

1210
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,334
Thank you.

1211
01:20:22,734 --> 01:20:24,167
Thank you.

1212
01:20:30,801 --> 01:20:33,434
TONY: Where do you think
you're going, bitch?

1213
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:38,901
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

1214
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:42,033
Our family's
weathered worse than you.

1215
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:46,200
You're just another sacrifice.

1216
01:20:47,133 --> 01:20:48,901
You're another goat.

1217
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,467
