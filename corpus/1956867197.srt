00:11:40,943 --> 00:11:45,046
The world is full of speeches
and look where that's got us.

180
00:11:45,112 --> 00:11:47,715
On that, we agree. Shots?

181
00:11:47,783 --> 00:11:49,016
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

182
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,854
- Yeah.
- May I, Dr. Collins?

183
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,055
Listen, Miya,
we're drinking together,

184
00:11:54,121 --> 00:11:57,024
you can call me Emma.
Go ahead.

185
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,993
(Miya)
Hmm.

186
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,830
- Oh.
- You are so sexy.

187
00:12:01,897 --> 00:12:03,130
[laughing]

188
00:12:03,197 --> 00:12:05,166
Did I, did I just say that
out loud?

189
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:06,567
(Shaw)
Oh, okay.

190
00:12:06,634 --> 00:12:08,402
You know, we all know
about you two.

191
00:12:08,469 --> 00:12:11,940
[laughs] Okay, so,
we have customs for drinking

192
00:12:12,006 --> 00:12:16,778
in Japan, and it is considered
polite to pour for others.

193
00:12:16,845 --> 00:12:18,613
And the young...

194
00:12:22,683 --> 00:12:24,051
pour for the old.

195
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,554
- 'Oh, damn.'
- Me! What about him?

196
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:27,622
[laughter]

197
00:12:27,688 --> 00:12:30,124
I'm your superior,
that's not cool.

198
00:12:30,191 --> 00:12:31,894
- Here.
- Thank you.

199
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,262
[indistinct chatter]

200
00:12:34,328 --> 00:12:37,131
- Kampai!
- Kampai!

201
00:12:37,198 --> 00:12:39,734
[intense music]

202
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,648
[rattling]

203
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,552
[compactor whirring]

204
00:13:01,255 --> 00:13:03,190
(Miya)
That's not enough, you know.

205
00:13:03,257 --> 00:13:05,794
[indistinct chatter]

206
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:10,498
[intense music]

207
00:13:12,733 --> 00:13:15,069
(Miya) 'Supplies
aren't due for a week.'

208
00:13:15,136 --> 00:13:17,338
Yeah, and it's not
the trash barge.

209
00:13:17,405 --> 00:13:20,141
[music continues]

210
00:13:23,812 --> 00:13:26,014
(Shaw) 'Have you seen
that boat before?'

211
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,584
(Emma)
Hmm... no.

212
00:13:31,719 --> 00:13:34,255
Who knows? They might have
some clothes on there.

213
00:13:34,322 --> 00:13:36,959
Get a shirt that fits you.

214
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,359
'Let's go check it out.'

215
00:13:39,962 --> 00:13:42,697
Emma.
I can't believe it.

216
00:13:42,763 --> 00:13:46,400
- Who's the hot guy?
- Richie Lowell.

217
00:13:46,467 --> 00:13:48,003
They went to grad school
together.

218
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,738
Wait, together or...
like together?

219
00:13:50,806 --> 00:13:55,209
- Richard?
- Hey. How you doing?

220
00:13:55,276 --> 00:13:58,479
(both)
Oh. Together.

221
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:02,483
Wow. I haven't seen you
in forever.

222
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,785
Yeah.

223
00:14:05,486 --> 00:14:07,321
What are you doing here?

224
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,223
We need your help.

225
00:14:11,292 --> 00:14:13,895
Guys? This is Richard
and Lucas.

226
00:14:13,962 --> 00:14:16,932
This is Spin,
he's our MIT tech wizard.

227
00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:19,467
- Uh, Shaw. You remember Shaw.
- Good to see you, Shaw.

228
00:14:19,533 --> 00:14:21,135
Good to see you too, Richie.

229
00:14:21,202 --> 00:14:23,571
Uh, it's Richard,
or Dr. Lowell now.

230
00:14:23,638 --> 00:14:25,706
- Your call, Eugene.
- And this is Miya.

231
00:14:25,773 --> 00:14:27,943
She's, um,
one of our summer students

232
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,744
'on loan
from the Toba Institute'

233
00:14:29,811 --> 00:14:32,014
'of Maritime Technology.
Did I get that right?'

234
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,314
Yeah. Nice to meet you.

235
00:14:33,381 --> 00:14:36,617
[speaking in Japanese]

236
00:14:36,684 --> 00:14:38,653
- Very nice to meet you, Miya.
- Nice to meet you.

237
00:14:38,719 --> 00:14:40,856
(Emma) 'These boys need a
little help from our Triton.'

238
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:44,358
- What are you looking to find?
- Three bulls.

239
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,660
It's a bad neighborhood
for bulls

240
00:14:45,726 --> 00:14:47,428
they'd be like sushi
to the whites.

241
00:14:47,495 --> 00:14:49,764
- 'Lucas?'
- Usually that'd be the case.

242
00:14:49,831 --> 00:14:51,565
We got a tracker in one.

243
00:14:51,632 --> 00:14:53,802
We're sure that
they were headed this way.

244
00:14:53,869 --> 00:14:56,270
A half dozen people went missing
about 100 miles

245
00:14:56,337 --> 00:14:57,839
up the Orange River.

246
00:14:57,906 --> 00:15:00,842
At first, the locals
thought it was crocs.

247
00:15:00,909 --> 00:15:02,643
- Turns out it was bull sharks.
- 'What?'

248
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,578
But Sharks don't
exhibit that kind of behavior

249
00:15:04,645 --> 00:15:07,548
unless they're stressed
or hungry, you know that.

250
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:11,185
Exactly, we were hired
to stop them

251
00:15:11,252 --> 00:15:12,486
and to find out what's wrong.

252
00:15:12,553 --> 00:15:15,389
Wait, so they kill people
on a river.

253
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,093
Bull sharks can survive
in freshwater.

254
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,494
Yeah, I picked
right up on that.

255
00:15:20,561 --> 00:15:24,699
They work together...
or they hunted in a pack.

256
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,569
That's not possible.

257
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,372
- Together like dolphins?
- That's right.

258
00:15:31,439 --> 00:15:33,041
I've seen it myself.

259
00:15:33,108 --> 00:15:35,376
I find this really
hard to believe.

260
00:15:36,744 --> 00:15:38,814
Okay. Miya..

261
00:15:40,414 --> 00:15:42,550
You got anything
on the Triton?

262
00:15:42,616 --> 00:15:46,620
(Miya)
Yeah. So..

263
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:49,825
...it's been at least a week
since I've seen

264
00:15:49,891 --> 00:15:52,326
any carcharhinus leucas.

265
00:15:52,393 --> 00:15:54,662
- 'A few dozen great whites.'
- No bulls?

266
00:15:54,729 --> 00:15:56,731
(Miya)
'Nope. Mm-mm.'

267
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,501
There you have it.

268
00:16:00,568 --> 00:16:03,704
I guess that's goodbye
and... good luck?

269
00:16:05,406 --> 00:16:07,508
It just looks like Waterblog.

270
00:16:07,575 --> 00:16:10,812
- You follow us?
- What do you think?

271
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:16,118
Yeah, it's a weird place
to call home, Em. It's grim.

272
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:18,319
Up here, yeah.

273
00:16:18,385 --> 00:16:21,422
Down there, it's, um,
it's heaven.

274
00:16:21,489 --> 00:16:25,359
Just you and the fish?
The way you like it?

275
00:16:25,426 --> 00:16:28,395
No sign of humanity around?

276
00:16:28,462 --> 00:16:32,901
I mean, who can blame you?
Look what we've done.

277
00:16:32,968 --> 00:16:36,270
Hey, why is a double PhD
in shark neurology

278
00:16:36,337 --> 00:16:37,671
out hunting sharks?

279
00:16:42,276 --> 00:16:45,847
Why don't you come aboard
for a drink and I'll tell you?

280
00:16:49,483 --> 00:16:51,318
Welcome aboard.

281
00:16:52,854 --> 00:16:55,289
You've come down
in the world, Richard.

282
00:16:55,356 --> 00:16:56,624
This thing can float?

283
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,894
My employer likes to keep
a low profile.

284
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:04,232
We're gonna look around,
see if we can locate our bulls.

285
00:17:04,298 --> 00:17:06,634
- 'Hey, Brown.'
- 'What's up, boss?'

286
00:17:08,804 --> 00:17:12,174
- 'Uh, whiskey?'
- 'I'm diving.'

287
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,776
- 'I bet you are, too.'
- 'Water it is.'

288
00:17:17,212 --> 00:17:18,814
[clears throat]

289
00:17:23,218 --> 00:17:25,653
(Emma)
'That's cool.'

290
00:17:25,719 --> 00:17:27,755
Yeah.

291
00:17:27,823 --> 00:17:29,723
Hey, you ever think about us?

292
00:17:31,893 --> 00:17:33,661
Sure, sometimes.

293
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,132
What do you think about?

294
00:17:37,199 --> 00:17:38,599
That it sucked
that my dad died

295
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,501
and you took that job in Sydney.

296
00:17:42,536 --> 00:17:44,672
But we're probably
exactly where we should be.

297
00:17:46,007 --> 00:17:47,675
Probably.

298
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,250
- Bella.
- Yeah.

299
00:17:55,317 --> 00:17:57,551
- Is that the shark you tracked?
- Yeah.

300
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,487
I found her yesterday. Deceased.

301
00:18:00,554 --> 00:18:01,990
Just trying to figure out
if I can learn

302
00:18:02,057 --> 00:18:04,226
anything from her brain.

303
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:06,727
- Did you?
- Unfortunately not.

304
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:11,498
- Light's still on.
- Oh. Here.

305
00:18:11,565 --> 00:18:14,102
So, who's paying?

306
00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:15,904
- Genotics Labs.
- Oh.

307
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:18,706
I know, I know,
the corporate overlords.

308
00:18:18,772 --> 00:18:21,542
I do a few projects for them,
they fund my research.

309
00:18:21,609 --> 00:18:23,611
So you're working
for Big Pharma.

310
00:18:23,677 --> 00:18:27,883
Let's face it, climate change
is here to stay, Emma.

311
00:18:27,949 --> 00:18:29,750
World's gonna get
a whole lot smaller.

312
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:31,853
And make some people
a lot of money.

313
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,755
- Sistine Chapel didn't...
- Didn't pay for itself.

314
00:18:38,927 --> 00:18:42,763
Hey, um, listen..

315
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:46,134
Just stay out of the water
until we've done our work.

316
00:18:46,201 --> 00:18:48,870
Okay? Just as a precaution.

317
00:18:48,937 --> 00:18:51,772
Well, thank you,
but we're working here, too.

318
00:18:53,707 --> 00:18:57,544
- Same old Emma.
- Same old Richard.

319
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,284
- Can I check it out?
- Sure, knock yourself out.

320
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,253
Just, uh, don't touch anything
that looks expensive, okay?

321
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,521
[chuckles]
Okay.

322
00:19:13,161 --> 00:19:15,629
Let's get it.

323
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,033
- Hey, bro. You ready?
- Hey, boss man. Oh, yeah.

324
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:20,302
Take care of yourself
down there.

325
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:22,070
Here you go.

326
00:19:22,137 --> 00:19:24,272
(Lucas) 'Alright, Brown's leading
the way and he's going the deepest.'

327
00:19:24,339 --> 00:19:28,209
'Make sure you got his back,
so he can go down further.'

328
00:19:28,276 --> 00:19:30,779
- Move in about 30 yards.
- Copy that, sir.

329
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:33,949
[instrumental music]

330

Miya, com check.

(Miya) 'I hear you loud and
clear, Dr. Collins.'

[water gurgling]

333
00:19:48,196 --> 00:19:51,166
- Going deeper.
- 'Careful.'

334
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,667
(Miya on comm)
'There are sharks around you.'

335
00:20:02,177 --> 00:20:07,115
Okay, you are closing in
on one of our blind spots now.

336
00:20:07,182 --> 00:20:09,417
(Emma)
Copy that, Miya.

337
00:20:09,483 --> 00:20:12,053
Headed for the nursery wall.

338
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,655
[intense music]

339
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,538
(Lucas on comm)
'Okay, team, how's it looking?'

340
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:35,276
(Schill) There's a lot of
black tips out here, no bulls.

341
00:20:37,979 --> 00:20:41,249
(Lucas) 'I think we're
gonna have to go deeper.'

342
00:20:41,316 --> 00:20:43,852
[water gurgling]

343
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,292

Activating the sensor now, Miya.

[keyboard clacking]

345
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:57,232
Good for frequency and data.
Next.

[water gurgling]

(Lucas) 'Okay, Brown, you go
deep, stay parallel with us.'

348
00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:10,378
- Copy.
- You boys be safe.

(Richard)
Roger that, boss.

352
00:21:23,058 --> 00:21:26,061
- Copy.
- 'Happy hunting.'

[music continues]

356
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:10,737
(Emma) I'm headed for
the next blind spot.

357
00:22:10,805 --> 00:22:13,308
(Miya)
'Got you, Dr. Collins.'

361
00:22:23,852 --> 00:22:25,686
We got a problem.

362
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:33,627
- Emma, what's wrong?
- Fuck.

363
00:22:33,694 --> 00:22:36,097
I've got two large
great whites down here.

364
00:22:36,164 --> 00:22:37,899
Fresh kills.

365
00:22:40,835 --> 00:22:42,237
[screams]

366
00:22:42,303 --> 00:22:44,771
I thought I told you
to stay out of the water.

367
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:46,307
- Richard...
- Emma...

368
00:22:46,374 --> 00:22:47,475
Richard, there's two down there!

369
00:22:47,542 --> 00:22:48,943
Calm down.

370
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,812
(Emma) There's two
dead sharks down there!

371
00:22:50,879 --> 00:22:55,016
(Richard) I know, I know. Yeah, yeah.
But you have to calm down.

372
00:22:57,552 --> 00:23:01,923
Emma, there is a bull in the
field, it's big. Moving fast.

373
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:05,493
- Richard, bull shark.
- What?

374
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,195
Get out the nursery now!

375
00:23:07,262 --> 00:23:09,264
It's in a vector
towards one of their divers.

376
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:11,933
(Richard) Lucas,
they've got a bull shark in the nursery

377
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,501
coming our way, copy.

378
00:23:13,568 --> 00:23:17,238
(Lucas) 'Our lucky day, boys.
Watch your six.'

379
00:23:17,305 --> 00:23:20,041
(Schill) Got you, boss,
our eyes are peeled.

380
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:21,976
(Earls)
Come on, you sneaky fucks.

381
00:23:24,145 --> 00:23:27,248
(Lucas)
'Brown, where are you?'

382
00:23:27,315 --> 00:23:29,750
Rising southwest,
depth, 90 feet.

383
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:36,457
(Lucas)
'Brown, do you read me?'

384
00:23:36,524 --> 00:23:38,159

385
00:23:38,226 --> 00:23:40,161
[intense music]

386
00:23:40,228 --> 00:23:42,397
- Brown.
- There he is. I see him.

387
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:45,533
(Richard)
It's okay. Yeah, we see him.

388
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,268
(Lucas)
Okay.

389
00:23:48,702 --> 00:23:50,838
[music continues]

390
00:23:54,776 --> 00:23:56,811

Shit!

393
00:24:05,253 --> 00:24:07,488
(Richard)
Come on, come on!

394
00:24:11,526 --> 00:24:13,895
I should get back to my team.

395
00:24:13,962 --> 00:24:16,297
Those great whites down there

396
00:24:16,364 --> 00:24:18,233
your bulls did that too?

397
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:19,500
Yeah.

398
00:24:19,567 --> 00:24:21,903
Those sharks aren't
acting like sharks, Richard.

399
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,504
They prey on
great white nurseries

400
00:24:23,571 --> 00:24:25,006
as a reliable food supply.

401
00:24:25,073 --> 00:24:26,641
Why didn't you tell us that
to begin with, man?

402
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:28,443
Great whites are faster
and stronger

403
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:29,877
they eat bull sharks for lunch.

404
00:24:29,944 --> 00:24:31,946
Not these. My theory is
that they're adapting

405
00:24:32,013 --> 00:24:34,349
to climate change faster
than the whites

406
00:24:34,415 --> 00:24:37,151
which is making them highly
aggressive towards everything.

407
00:24:37,218 --> 00:24:39,554
I was hired to perform
a neurological evaluation.

408
00:24:39,621 --> 00:24:41,089
So Genotics can make
money off them?

409
00:24:41,155 --> 00:24:43,858
Oh, you know, Emma,
I just lost a man down there.

410
00:24:47,262 --> 00:24:49,464
So what do we do?

411
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:54,235
We don't get those sharks
out of the water now,

412
00:24:54,302 --> 00:24:57,605
they'll destroy everything
we're working to save.

413
00:24:57,672 --> 00:24:59,773
[seagulls cawing]

414
00:25:05,013 --> 00:25:08,082
Most spooky thing
I've ever seen in my life.

415
00:25:08,149 --> 00:25:10,585
The way Brown was driving
that ACV

416
00:25:10,652 --> 00:25:12,520
like he didn't even know
he was dead.

417
00:25:12,587 --> 00:25:14,422
It could be ten miles
before his batteries died

418
00:25:14,489 --> 00:25:18,660
think about it. It could be
any one of us. You, me.

419
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:21,029
Not me.

420
00:25:21,095 --> 00:25:23,298
(Lucas)
I knew Brown for 15 years

421
00:25:23,364 --> 00:25:26,034
had my back more times
than I can count.

422
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:29,003
And so if you have
to talk about him..

423
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,805
...show some respect.

424
00:25:33,975 --> 00:25:35,810
Gear up, we're wet in 30.

425
00:25:35,877 --> 00:25:37,078
- Copy that.
- Okay.

426
00:25:39,681 --> 00:25:42,016
Emma, are you seriously
gonna help them out?

427
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:45,553
We are.

428
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,256
We just lost a human being.

429
00:25:48,323 --> 00:25:50,825
And at least two mature
great whites

430
00:25:50,892 --> 00:25:52,894
'we can't afford
to lose any more.'

431
00:25:54,362 --> 00:25:56,964
[sighs] I know you and
Richard were close...

432
00:25:57,031 --> 00:25:58,833
And I know you and Dad
never liked him.

433
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,102
(Shaw)
Who gives a shit if I like him?

434
00:26:01,169 --> 00:26:04,172
I don't trust him.
Do you?

435
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:09,844
- Spin.
- Yeah?

436
00:26:09,911 --> 00:26:13,514
Can you do a search history
on a GPS tracking signal?

437
00:26:13,581 --> 00:26:16,451
Uh, well, it depends
which kind of tracker.

438
00:26:16,517 --> 00:26:18,553
Well, the bull
in Richard's lab, Bella

439
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:20,722
it was tagged with
an acoustic-to-radio

440
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:22,256
conversion beacon.

441
00:26:22,323 --> 00:26:24,492
Wow, th-that's a really
tricky piece of tech.

442
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:29,964
But you can run a search
history on... any GPS beacon.

443
00:26:30,031 --> 00:26:32,367
- Uh...
- Can't you, Spin?

444
00:26:32,433 --> 00:26:35,403
Yeah. 'Course I can...
I mean, I can try.

445
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:39,607
- You can more than try.
- Right, I... I'll do that.

446
00:26:44,412 --> 00:26:46,614
You ever heard of knocking,
boys?

447
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:50,451
We got a plan. Lucas?

448
00:26:50,518 --> 00:26:53,154
Folks, we think it's best
to deploy a sub drone

449
00:26:53,221 --> 00:26:56,391
that mimics the movements and
the electrical field of a seal.

450
00:26:56,457 --> 00:26:58,192
It will also chum out
seal blood.

451
00:26:58,259 --> 00:27:02,563
- Sharks like seals.
- Thank you for that.

452
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,999
Look, we'll station ourselves
in your nursery,

453
00:27:05,066 --> 00:27:09,470
and we'll use your Triton system
as our spotter.

454
00:27:09,537 --> 00:27:11,706
And hopefully you'll warn us,
yeah?

455
00:27:11,773 --> 00:27:13,408
[intense music]

456
00:27:15,309 --> 00:27:17,211
Great. We'll get a man in here

457
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:19,113
and you can show me
how this system works.

458
00:27:20,548 --> 00:27:22,183
Thank you.

459
00:27:23,651 --> 00:27:26,354
Thank you for bringing
a big strong man in here

460
00:27:26,421 --> 00:27:29,123
because this little girl
with a degree

461
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,292
in environmental acoustic
propulsion engineering

462
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:34,362
couldn't possibly handle it.

463
00:27:34,429 --> 00:27:36,631
No offense, Emma, but sometimes

464
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:39,667
a big strong man
just wants to help.

465
00:27:39,734 --> 00:27:41,269
And she is just a kid.

466
00:27:42,236 --> 00:27:44,472
[speaking in Japanese]

467
00:27:48,276 --> 00:27:51,345
- What you got there, fellas?
- Haloperidol cocktails.

468
00:27:51,412 --> 00:27:53,681
Yeah, we'd prefer to take
our bulls alive.

469
00:27:53,748 --> 00:27:58,619
Yeah, we've-we've got those too.
But what are those?

470
00:27:58,686 --> 00:28:03,424
Explosive tipped. For when
we don't want them alive.

471
00:28:03,491 --> 00:28:05,092
But this whole place
is falling apart.

472
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:06,727
One of those things
hits a piling

473
00:28:06,795 --> 00:28:08,563

goes under.

00:28:08,629 --> 00:28:12,300
There's nothing to worry about,
my men don't miss.

475
00:28:12,366 --> 00:28:13,869
I wanna know
when your shark problem

476
00:28:13,936 --> 00:28:15,136
became our shark problem.

477
00:28:15,203 --> 00:28:16,839
Because we're all in this
together.

478
00:28:16,905 --> 00:28:19,207
Well, kumba-fucking-ya, Richie.

479
00:28:21,108 --> 00:28:23,978
Em. I mean, you can't
expect me to put my men

480
00:28:24,045 --> 00:28:26,047
in the water
without defending themselves.

481
00:28:30,418 --> 00:28:32,788
Spin, give him access
to our com system.

482
00:28:32,855 --> 00:28:35,423
Got it.

483
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:38,459
And Miya, you see a bull,
you let everyone know, okay?

484
00:28:38,526 --> 00:28:40,796
On it.

485
00:28:40,863 --> 00:28:44,165

That's really weird because
they've been chumming out

495
00:29:59,073 --> 00:30:01,043

'Yeah, what?'

00:31:01,003 --> 00:31:05,172
Oh, no. We're doing
the girl talk thing, aren't we?

505
00:31:06,741 --> 00:31:09,510
I like Spin.

Okay, wait,
that's all you got for me?

512
00:31:35,536 --> 00:31:38,807
- "Don't worry, be happy"?
- Yeah.

bad with people.

[beeping]

524
00:32:29,323 --> 00:32:30,524
- Bull shark!
- Okay.

525
00:32:30,591 --> 00:32:32,326
Miya's got word,
incoming bull.

526
00:32:32,393 --> 00:32:36,397
175 degrees southwest,
depth 18 and dropping.

527
00:32:36,464 --> 00:32:38,499
It's heading toward
your team, Dr. Lowell.

528
00:32:38,566 --> 00:32:40,334
Got a sighting
on one of the sharks.

529
00:32:40,401 --> 00:32:41,937
Got you, sir, copy.

530
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:44,538
[dramatic music]

531
00:32:44,605 --> 00:32:47,708
It turned away,
it's in the cove.

532
00:32:47,776 --> 00:32:49,744
(Richard)
I'm close to that position.

533
00:32:49,811 --> 00:32:53,714
(Lucas) 'Richard,
it's too risky, wait for us.'

534
00:32:53,782 --> 00:32:55,616
No, Lucas, stay there,
I'll bring this one

535
00:32:55,683 --> 00:32:57,384
back to the nursery,
you can take it.

536
00:32:57,451 --> 00:32:59,653
(Lucas)
'I'll say again, wait for us.'

537
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:04,358
[panting]

538
00:33:04,425 --> 00:33:06,128
- Keep talking to him.
- Okay.

539
00:33:06,194 --> 00:33:08,797
Watch out,
it's still in the cove.

540
00:33:11,967 --> 00:33:15,503
(Emma) 'Richard, that bull is off our
grid, you won't see it coming.'

541
00:33:15,569 --> 00:33:17,939
[music continues]

542
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,984
Richard, don't go in the cove,
it's not safe there

543
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,718
we can't see you on the Triton.

544
00:33:30,786 --> 00:33:33,621
I'm okay. Just keep your eyes
peeled for the other two.

545
00:33:38,894 --> 00:33:41,595
(Emma)
'Richard! Shark! Bull shark!'

546
00:33:46,168 --> 00:33:49,503
- Richard? Richard!
- Shit!

547
00:33:51,807 --> 00:33:53,909
Whoa!

548
00:33:53,975 --> 00:33:55,777
[screams]

549
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,248
- Richard!
- Emma!

550
00:34:00,314 --> 00:34:02,851
[dramatic music]

551
00:34:07,889 --> 00:34:10,391
[heavy breathing]

552
00:34:23,337 --> 00:34:24,471
[groaning]

553
00:34:24,538 --> 00:34:27,075
[grunting]

554
00:34:29,978 --> 00:34:32,513
[groaning]

555
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:44,793
- Quick! Out of the water!
- Grab his legs, grab his legs.

556
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,527
[panting]

557
00:34:46,594 --> 00:34:48,629
[groaning and panting]

558
00:34:50,298 --> 00:34:51,665
- You okay?
- Lucas.

559
00:34:51,732 --> 00:34:53,034
Get the shark out of the water

560
00:34:53,101 --> 00:34:55,469
get him on the boat
and get it sedated.

561
00:34:55,536 --> 00:34:57,005
- Alright.

562
00:34:57,072 --> 00:34:59,140
- I'm gonna take this off.
- Okay, yeah.

563
00:34:59,207 --> 00:35:00,741
Opening your buckles.

564
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:02,676
[groans]

565
00:35:05,412 --> 00:35:07,514
[water gurgling]

566
00:35:11,518 --> 00:35:13,822
[whistling]

567
00:35:20,761 --> 00:35:22,864
Yeah, yeah, go. Go.

568
00:35:22,931 --> 00:35:25,267
[groans]

569
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:27,701
[panting]
Okay.

570
00:35:27,768 --> 00:35:30,839
(Richard) Well,
mesh weaving was worth every penny.

571
00:35:30,906 --> 00:35:34,309
Well, good thing the shark
was sleeping when it bit you.

572
00:35:34,376 --> 00:35:37,478
[groans]
Very funny.

573
00:35:37,544 --> 00:35:40,015
I mean, look on the bright side,
right?

574
00:35:40,081 --> 00:35:42,050
You'll never have to pay
for another drink

575
00:35:42,117 --> 00:35:44,853
for the rest of your life.

576
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,922
What, you'd buy me a drink?

577
00:35:49,991 --> 00:35:51,759
Maybe.

578
00:35:51,826 --> 00:35:53,828
Oh, would you listen to me
tell you the story

579
00:35:53,895 --> 00:35:58,800
about the time a young bull
almost bit me in half?

580
00:35:58,867 --> 00:36:01,002
But I fought him off
all by myself.

581
00:36:01,069 --> 00:36:03,371
- Uh-uh.
- And then I pried myself free.

582
00:36:03,437 --> 00:36:08,109
Tooth by tooth by tooth,
I was very brave.

583
00:36:08,176 --> 00:36:10,111
Yeah, I'd buy you that drink.

584
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:15,683
But I wouldn't believe
a word you said.

585
00:36:18,887 --> 00:36:21,722
And one of your men
did just get bit in half.

586
00:36:28,129 --> 00:36:30,231
Thanks for saving my life
out there.

587
00:36:30,298 --> 00:36:33,068
[music continues]

588
00:36:33,134 --> 00:36:35,602
You would've done the same.

589
00:36:39,573 --> 00:36:42,476
I should get back to my boat.

590
00:36:42,543 --> 00:36:44,678
I wanna see that shark.

591
00:36:49,417 --> 00:36:51,618
[humming]

592
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,390
[line reeling]

593
00:36:55,457 --> 00:36:58,159
Oh.

594
00:36:58,226 --> 00:36:59,626
Yeah.

595
00:36:59,693 --> 00:37:02,364
[chuckles]
Yeah, yeah.

596
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,265
[grunting]

597
00:37:05,532 --> 00:37:07,634
Yeah.

598
00:37:07,701 --> 00:37:09,703
[grunting]
Snagged.

599
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:12,140
[water splashing]

600
00:37:13,674 --> 00:37:16,111
[grunting]

601
00:37:29,024 --> 00:37:31,793
No, no, no,
not my lucky hook.

602
00:37:34,195 --> 00:37:35,263
[grunts]

603
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:37,198
[water splashing]

604
00:37:41,336 --> 00:37:43,872
[intense music]

605
00:38:06,227 --> 00:38:08,263
Wow, it's beautiful.

606
00:38:10,597 --> 00:38:14,135
It's a juvenile.
How old do we think it is?

607
00:38:14,202 --> 00:38:19,040
[exhales] Ah, three to four years at
most, I'm guessing.

608
00:38:19,107 --> 00:38:22,510
Looks older.

609
00:38:22,576 --> 00:38:24,711
Nearly mature.

610
00:38:27,449 --> 00:38:28,917
What happened to you?

611
00:38:28,983 --> 00:38:31,352
How much Haloperidol
did you pump into her?

612
00:38:31,419 --> 00:38:33,587
I gotta put an IV line in.

613
00:38:33,654 --> 00:38:37,658
30 ccs.
But I think she's a he.

614
00:38:37,724 --> 00:38:40,195
Nah. Nope, no way.

615
00:38:40,261 --> 00:38:41,796
[groans]

616
00:38:43,531 --> 00:38:47,734
Wow, yeah, no mistaking
those claspers for a cloaca.

617
00:38:47,802 --> 00:38:49,770
How unprofessional of me.

618
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:54,342
Okay, get him oxygenated,
get a sedative line in.

619
00:38:54,409 --> 00:38:56,077
And watch his vitals, okay?

620
00:38:56,144 --> 00:38:58,913
- Yes, sir.
- 'Good job.'

621
00:39:00,982 --> 00:39:02,616
I'll go with you tomorrow.

622
00:39:02,683 --> 00:39:03,918
I'll help you catch
the other two.

623
00:39:03,985 --> 00:39:05,887
No, you don't have
to do that, Emma.

624
00:39:05,954 --> 00:39:08,089
I'm not asking,
I'm telling.

625
00:39:08,156 --> 00:39:10,959
If you got man-eaters out there,
we both need to find out why.

626
00:39:17,265 --> 00:39:19,134
[chuckles]

627
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,402
[seagull cawing]

628
00:39:25,772 --> 00:39:27,475
(Nandi)
'Bahari!'

629
00:39:27,542 --> 00:39:29,310
[intense music]

630
00:39:29,377 --> 00:39:31,179
Wait, Nandi!

631
00:39:34,616 --> 00:39:36,050
(Nandi)
Bahari!

632
00:39:37,485 --> 00:39:39,420
Nandi! Don't go in the water,
don't go in the water!

633
00:39:39,487 --> 00:39:41,489
Don't go in the water,
don't go in the water.

634
00:39:41,556 --> 00:39:44,092
[panting]

635
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:45,726
Shaw!

636
00:39:49,264 --> 00:39:50,899
[engine revving]

637
00:39:52,733 --> 00:39:54,768
[music continues]

638
00:40:08,383 --> 00:40:13,521
(Emma)
'It's okay, Shaw, I got it.'

639
00:40:13,588 --> 00:40:15,456
'Nandi?'

640
00:40:21,362 --> 00:40:23,464
[dramatic music]

641
00:40:23,531 --> 00:40:24,566
[gasps]

642
00:40:24,632 --> 00:40:26,334
(Emma)
'Oh, my God.'

643
00:40:32,273 --> 00:40:34,809
[mellow music]

644
00:40:59,033 --> 00:41:01,735
There's still two more out there
and we need to find them..

645
00:41:01,803 --> 00:41:03,972
whether your girlfriend
helps us or not.

646
00:41:04,038 --> 00:41:06,507
You do your job,
I'll do mine.

647
00:41:08,142 --> 00:41:10,578
Well, you're the one
who knows Collins.

648
00:41:10,645 --> 00:41:12,647
What do you think she'll do?

649
00:41:12,714 --> 00:41:14,983
That's none of your concern.

650
00:41:18,386 --> 00:41:20,188
Yet.

651
00:41:25,026 --> 00:41:29,163
Spin?
Before, did you find anything?

652
00:41:30,898 --> 00:41:33,835
Remember that,
um, that GPS beacon for Bella

653
00:41:33,901 --> 00:41:35,837
the shark they tracked?

654
00:41:35,903 --> 00:41:38,673
Here.

655
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:42,610
So... I searched the last
GPS tracking beacon frequency

656
00:41:42,677 --> 00:41:45,046
sent to the Thasos..

657
00:41:45,113 --> 00:41:48,983
...then I tapped into their sat
network, which just a heads up

658
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:51,853
is not... entirely legal, but...

659
00:41:51,919 --> 00:41:53,221
Tell me what I'm looking at.

660
00:41:53,288 --> 00:41:55,623
So, I was able to plot
the signal's course.

661
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:59,027
Whatever Richard and his team
were looking for

662
00:41:59,093 --> 00:42:00,795
it was never up any river.

663
00:42:00,862 --> 00:42:02,964
- Shit, are you sure?
- Uh-huh.

664
00:42:03,031 --> 00:42:05,967
That shark's GPS tracking beacon
was first activated

665
00:42:06,034 --> 00:42:08,303
right... there.

666
00:42:08,369 --> 00:42:12,040
Research facility Akheilos,
owned by some..

667
00:42:12,106 --> 00:42:15,476
billionaire pharmaceutical guy
named Carl Durant.

668
00:42:15,543 --> 00:42:17,979
No, wait, I remember this.
This was on the news, right?

669
00:42:18,046 --> 00:42:19,347
The whole place sank
or something?

670
00:42:19,414 --> 00:42:22,050
(Spin)
Right, took Durant down with it.

671
00:42:23,318 --> 00:42:24,986
I mean, that's weird, right?

672
00:42:25,053 --> 00:42:28,256
I wanna know what these assholes
are doing with the sharks.

673
00:42:28,323 --> 00:42:30,091
Or to them.

674
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:33,961
- Em, I'm so sorry about Bahari.
- You lied to me!

675
00:42:34,028 --> 00:42:37,231
You didn't track those sharks
from the Orange River.

676
00:42:37,298 --> 00:42:41,035
They-they escaped from
some kind of research facility.

677
00:42:41,102 --> 00:42:42,203
How do you know that?

678
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:44,138
Those sharks have been altered

679
00:42:44,205 --> 00:42:46,074
engineered,
they're not sharks, Richard!

680
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,942
- They're something else!
- Emma. Emma...

681
00:42:48,009 --> 00:42:50,244
What were they doing
with them in Akheilos?

682
00:42:50,311 --> 00:42:52,013
[bangs]

683
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,749
Lucas! Did you hear that?

684
00:42:54,817 --> 00:42:55,784
[banging]

685
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:57,452
Wh-what the hell is happening?

686
00:42:57,518 --> 00:42:59,454
There's too much force
in those hits

687
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,855
they're gonna bust the hull
straight through

688
00:43:00,922 --> 00:43:02,623
the observation window.

689
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:04,359
The lab. The lab!

690
00:43:06,361 --> 00:43:07,328
[glass cracking]

691
00:43:07,395 --> 00:43:09,097
That window's not gonna
last much longer.

692
00:43:09,163 --> 00:43:10,431
Our sharks are right there,
what are you waiting for?

693
00:43:10,498 --> 00:43:11,499
Sedate them!

694
00:43:11,566 --> 00:43:12,867
Are we gonna let them
take this ship

695
00:43:12,934 --> 00:43:14,335
down, Richard?

696
00:43:14,402 --> 00:43:16,471
[glass cracking]

697
00:43:16,537 --> 00:43:18,373
No. Charged tips.

698
00:43:18,439 --> 00:43:19,941
That's not your decision
to make.

699
00:43:20,007 --> 00:43:22,577
You have a kill shot,
you take it.

700
00:43:22,643 --> 00:43:25,213
- 'I'm out of this dump.'
- Richard.

701
00:43:25,279 --> 00:43:27,715
Come on.

702
00:43:27,783 --> 00:43:29,517
[glass cracking]

703
00:43:29,584 --> 00:43:32,019
They're too deep.
I can't get a shot.

704
00:43:34,522 --> 00:43:36,457
What the..

705
00:43:36,524 --> 00:43:38,726
Get inside,
we're in the line of fire.

706
00:43:38,794 --> 00:43:42,831
- Come on, Miya.
- Hey! Asshole.

707
00:43:42,897 --> 00:43:44,732
If one of those shots
hits over here

708
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,102
you're gonna take
this entire village down.

709
00:43:49,604 --> 00:43:51,539
Fuck!

710
00:43:51,606 --> 00:43:53,975
[intense music]

711
00:44:00,915 --> 00:44:03,184
Richard?

712
00:44:03,251 --> 00:44:05,219
They're here for him.

713
00:44:05,286 --> 00:44:07,955
Then give them
what they want.

714
00:44:08,022 --> 00:44:09,624
I got this.

715
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:11,559
[crane whirring]

716
00:44:11,626 --> 00:44:13,561
[intense music]

717
00:44:17,732 --> 00:44:19,634
What are you waiting for?
Let the shark go.

718
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:22,437
And lose the one live specimen
we have forever?

719
00:44:24,038 --> 00:44:26,340
Not a chance.
Now, give it to me.

720
00:44:29,043 --> 00:44:33,314
Back... the fuck... off.

721
00:44:34,817 --> 00:44:37,351
[intense music]

722
00:44:49,697 --> 00:44:52,200
What just happened?

723
00:44:52,266 --> 00:44:54,202
[music continues]

724
00:44:57,238 --> 00:44:59,440
Your sharks..

725
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:03,611
...they understood.

726
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:10,585
Okay, you deserve
an explanation...

727
00:45:10,651 --> 00:45:14,021
No! No, not another one
of your explanations, Richard.

728
00:45:14,088 --> 00:45:17,325
The truth!

729
00:45:17,391 --> 00:45:20,929
Those two sharks were
trying to save their brother.

730
00:45:20,995 --> 00:45:24,732
It didn't start with Akheilos,
that was second gen work.

731
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,767
It started with research
on makos

732
00:45:26,835 --> 00:45:30,238
trying to acquire proteins
to treat Alzheimer's.

733
00:45:30,304 --> 00:45:32,473
Right, but they couldn't
harvest enough for a trial

734
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:35,743
the makos' brains were
too small, so?

735
00:45:35,811 --> 00:45:37,813
Were.

736
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,983
They genetically engineered them
to have larger brains?

737
00:45:41,048 --> 00:45:42,985
Along came Carl Durant.

738
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:46,387
Now, he acquired that research
with a different goal.

739
00:45:46,454 --> 00:45:49,892
If he could increase
the intelligence of bulls

740
00:45:49,958 --> 00:45:52,760
he could engineer
the same treatment for humans.

741
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:56,364
An evolutionary leap.

742
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:57,698
You sound like you believe that.

743
00:45:57,765 --> 00:45:59,133
'They blew up Akheilos to stop'

744
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,969
those sharks from escaping.

745
00:46:01,035 --> 00:46:03,005
Bella and her pups
got out alive.

746
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:05,306
They've been trying to capture
and kill them ever since.

747
00:46:05,373 --> 00:46:09,310
Explosive lures, poison,
never the same way twice.

748
00:46:09,377 --> 00:46:12,313
Yeah. Right.
Because they're learning.

749
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:15,583
Those are the last
of Bella's offspring.

750
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:17,552
The only three left.

751
00:46:17,618 --> 00:46:20,789
Genotics Labs bought the patents
for treating Alzheimer's

752
00:46:20,856 --> 00:46:22,323
and increasing intelligence.

753
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:24,225
Okay, so you're gonna
carve up Scarface up there...

754
00:46:24,292 --> 00:46:28,396
(Richard) 'Oh, my God!
Just spare me the judgment, Emma.'

755
00:46:28,462 --> 00:46:31,934
Now, we can help people,
not just talk about it.

756
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,969
- Oh.

757
00:46:34,036 --> 00:46:36,203
[groans]
Watch.

758
00:46:40,141 --> 00:46:43,644
When I activate Bella's tracker

759
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:47,415
that shark's extremely
sensitive neuro-electro

760
00:46:47,481 --> 00:46:50,618
reception system,
its sixth sense, kicks in.

761
00:46:55,656 --> 00:46:57,758
He misses her.

762
00:46:57,826 --> 00:47:00,796
When these sharks were born,
their-their brains were

763
00:47:00,862 --> 00:47:02,831
imprinted with their mother's
tracker frequency

764
00:47:02,898 --> 00:47:05,433
I mean, it's one of this
shit show's happy accidents.

765
00:47:05,499 --> 00:47:06,267
Don't.

766
00:47:06,334 --> 00:47:07,836
It makes for a powerful,

767
00:47:07,903 --> 00:47:09,370
emotional connection.

768
00:47:09,437 --> 00:47:12,340
I-I-I used it to draw the bulls
to me yesterday

769
00:47:12,406 --> 00:47:14,141
and even though that they knew
that their mother was dead

770
00:47:14,208 --> 00:47:15,610
they couldn't help themselves.

771
00:47:15,676 --> 00:47:18,046
Right, so that's why
you had Bella's beacon.

772
00:47:18,112 --> 00:47:22,116
I-I just.. I can't get
close enough to catching them.

773
00:47:22,183 --> 00:47:24,418
They're too smart.

774
00:47:24,485 --> 00:47:28,023
But they're drawn to this
frequency just the same.

775
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:29,724
Emma..

776
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:32,360
If-if we can study
that shark's brain

777
00:47:32,426 --> 00:47:35,030
if we can develop the same
kind of bond in people

778
00:47:35,097 --> 00:47:36,597
imagine how we can
change the world

779
00:47:36,664 --> 00:47:40,836
to make humanity feel, Emma,
and from that... to act.

780
00:47:40,902 --> 00:47:43,437
Stop it, just turn it off.

781
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,607
Stop.

782
00:47:50,511 --> 00:47:56,051
- This is torture.
- No, Emma, this is progress.

783
00:47:56,118 --> 00:47:57,819
Turn it off, I swear
to fucking God

784
00:47:57,886 --> 00:48:01,823
you better turn that off,
fucking turn it off, Richard!

785
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:03,658
It's off.

786
00:48:07,161 --> 00:48:09,697
[intense music]

787
00:48:13,167 --> 00:48:17,271
I'm sorry. But I lied because
I knew you would never approve.

788
00:48:17,338 --> 00:48:18,840
Well, you're right
about one thing then.

789
00:48:18,907 --> 00:48:21,409
That is the most valuable animal
on the planet

790
00:48:21,475 --> 00:48:23,277
and the clock is ticking.

791
00:48:23,344 --> 00:48:24,578
These juveniles
are maturing faster

792
00:48:24,645 --> 00:48:25,881
than we've ever seen before

793
00:48:25,947 --> 00:48:28,683
if we fail to capture
the other two right here

794
00:48:28,749 --> 00:48:31,053
right now, if they mate,
I mean, you see what they can do

795
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:33,822
how they can kill.

796
00:48:33,889 --> 00:48:36,925
It's the end of the ocean.

797
00:48:36,992 --> 00:48:39,861
Everything that we care about.

798
00:48:39,928 --> 00:48:41,863
Can't you see that?

799
00:48:44,665 --> 00:48:46,935
Yeah.

800
00:48:47,002 --> 00:48:48,669
[groans]

801
00:48:48,736 --> 00:48:50,204
Yeah, I see.

802
00:48:50,271 --> 00:48:52,640
I see you knew exactly
what we were dealing with

803
00:48:52,707 --> 00:48:54,843
and someone I care about
is dead.

804
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:03,952
- I don't know what that was.
- But I kinda loved it.

805
00:49:04,019 --> 00:49:05,987
[instrumental music]

806
00:49:06,054 --> 00:49:07,388
[chuckles]

807
00:49:15,897 --> 00:49:18,399
Shouldn't have told
your girl anything.

808
00:49:18,466 --> 00:49:20,434
Your damn sharks are smarter
than you are.

809
00:49:20,501 --> 00:49:22,603
Window's been fixed,
you can go.

810
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:25,841
Yeah? You're-you're out here
trying to save the world

811
00:49:25,907 --> 00:49:28,743
but you don't mind putting
everyone else's lives in danger.

812
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:30,678
I said get out, Lucas.

813
00:49:30,745 --> 00:49:32,580
Why keep this
magic shark lure of yours

814
00:49:32,646 --> 00:49:36,118
a secret from us, Richard?
Huh?

815
00:49:36,184 --> 00:49:37,518
Hey, give it back.

816
00:49:37,585 --> 00:49:39,353
[laughs]

817
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:42,356
Oh, you didn't want
Genotics Labs to know?

818
00:49:42,423 --> 00:49:44,159
Worried about the ethics here?

819
00:49:44,226 --> 00:49:46,995
Or your own future payday
when you quit working

820
00:49:47,062 --> 00:49:49,197
for Genotics
and start your own company?

821
00:49:49,263 --> 00:49:51,632
- That's absurd.
- Is it?

822
00:49:51,699 --> 00:49:54,535
If you hadn't kept this from us,
we might've finished

823
00:49:54,602 --> 00:49:58,039
our work here
a whole lot quicker.

824
00:49:58,106 --> 00:49:59,673
What are you gonna do?

825
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:03,145
You're so smart,
what do you think?

826
00:50:03,211 --> 00:50:05,247
Oh, come on,
don't look so surprised.

827
00:50:05,312 --> 00:50:09,084
[scoffs] We're not the
ones who upgraded a shark,

828
00:50:09,151 --> 00:50:11,887
but we are the sorry assholes
they sent in

829
00:50:11,953 --> 00:50:14,655
to clean up the mess.

830
00:50:14,722 --> 00:50:17,625
Two bull sharks attack
a 100-foot ship

831
00:50:17,691 --> 00:50:20,896
and then back off because
they recognized a weapon?

832
00:50:22,463 --> 00:50:25,566
That's not real,
that... doesn't happen.

833
00:50:25,633 --> 00:50:27,701
- You saw it too.
- We sure did.

834
00:50:27,768 --> 00:50:31,807
- Okay, so what do we do now?
- Report it.

835
00:50:31,873 --> 00:50:33,809
- Spin?
- Yeah, it's gonna be a problem.

836
00:50:33,875 --> 00:50:35,844
- Why?
- The Internet's down again.

837
00:50:35,911 --> 00:50:41,515
Basically everything that
I live for... almost everything.

838
00:50:41,582 --> 00:50:44,451
- Could it be the satellite?
- Uh, yeah. Could be.

839
00:50:46,988 --> 00:50:48,756
Okay, hold the fort.

840
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:57,065
[grunts]

841
00:50:58,632 --> 00:51:00,001
Alright, boys.

842
00:51:02,603 --> 00:51:04,973
- Time to finish this.
- Copy.

843
00:51:07,042 --> 00:51:08,944
They're going back in.

844
00:51:09,010 --> 00:51:11,445
They have something in that
pretty funky-looking metal case.

845
00:51:11,512 --> 00:51:14,348
Like, funky
in a James Brown way, or..

846
00:51:15,482 --> 00:51:16,818
What do you think?

847
00:51:20,322 --> 00:51:23,624
- Is that drone fixed and ready?
- Yeah.

848
00:51:23,691 --> 00:51:25,827
Let's see what they're up to.

849
00:51:31,066 --> 00:51:32,901
[water gurgling]

850
00:51:32,968 --> 00:51:35,502
[intense music]

851
00:51:41,977 --> 00:51:44,813
- Oh.
- Be careful. Thanks.

852
00:51:51,418 --> 00:51:53,387
[phone keys beeping]

853
00:51:53,454 --> 00:51:56,590
[call tone]

854
00:51:56,657 --> 00:51:59,393
[music continues]

855
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,636
[water gurgling]

856
00:52:17,544 --> 00:52:18,947
Close, but not too close.

857
00:52:19,014 --> 00:52:21,149
Love the range
on this baby.

858
00:52:22,984 --> 00:52:24,485
[water gurgling]

859
00:52:26,354 --> 00:52:28,890
[music continues]

860
00:52:44,105 --> 00:52:45,941
[drill whirring]

861
00:52:49,878 --> 00:52:51,512
What the hell are they doing?

862
00:52:51,578 --> 00:52:54,515
Hey, guys, come in here!

863
00:52:54,581 --> 00:52:56,918
I've got the drone feed
on the Triton.

864
00:53:01,588 --> 00:53:03,825
Let's see what they've got
in that case.

865
00:53:06,094 --> 00:53:07,929
Zoom in.

866
00:53:12,133 --> 00:53:14,202
Oh, shit.

867
00:53:14,269 --> 00:53:17,172
What do you mean, "Oh, shit"?

868
00:53:17,238 --> 00:53:19,240
What does he mean, "Oh, shit"?

869
00:53:19,307 --> 00:53:20,942
[water gurgling]

870
00:53:23,744 --> 00:53:26,147
I gotta find Emma... now.

871
00:53:40,462 --> 00:53:42,529
Shit.

872
00:53:42,596 --> 00:53:45,066
[sighs]
Dumb idea, Dr. Collins.

873
00:53:45,133 --> 00:53:47,135
Emma, where are you?

874
00:53:47,202 --> 00:53:49,170
[intense music]

875
00:53:55,642 --> 00:53:58,179
[breathing heavily]

876
00:54:06,488 --> 00:54:09,024
[panting]

877
00:54:10,524 --> 00:54:11,960
Fuck.

878
00:54:17,531 --> 00:54:18,867
[inhales]

879
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:25,240
[gasps]

880
00:54:25,306 --> 00:54:26,908
Okay, so here's the deal.

881
00:54:26,975 --> 00:54:30,145
- They cut the satellite line.
- Emma.

882
00:54:30,211 --> 00:54:32,613
They got one shark
they're gonna carve up

883
00:54:32,679 --> 00:54:34,816
and they wanna kill
the other two... fast.

884
00:54:34,883 --> 00:54:37,485
If those two juvie bulls
start making babies...

885
00:54:37,551 --> 00:54:40,088
We're talking... seamageddon.

886
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:44,993
- Seamageddon?
- Bigger fish to fry, Emma.

887
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:48,129
What? No,
this is as big as it gets...

888
00:54:48,196 --> 00:54:51,232
Listen to me, that was a mine
that they drilled

889
00:54:51,299 --> 00:54:53,168
into the nursery wall.

890
00:54:55,569 --> 00:54:56,971
For sinking ships.

891
00:54:57,038 --> 00:54:59,740
Her dad and I used to employ
the same ones in the Gulf.

892
00:54:59,808 --> 00:55:01,910
'They magnetically attach
to the hull.'

893
00:55:01,976 --> 00:55:04,479
They pack a hell of a punch,
believe me.

894
00:55:04,546 --> 00:55:06,014
How do they use the mine?

895
00:55:06,081 --> 00:55:08,682
Hope that they get lucky
that those two bull sharks

896
00:55:08,749 --> 00:55:11,052
happen to swim by?

897
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:12,554
Geography.

898
00:55:12,619 --> 00:55:15,123
The nursery is in a trench,
a canyon enclosed by two walls.

899
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:17,859
The shockwave from that mine
will bounce between the walls

900
00:55:17,926 --> 00:55:20,095
back and forth creating
a fucking blender from hell.

901
00:55:20,161 --> 00:55:23,865
'The kinetic energy in that
canyon will destroy everything.'

902
00:55:23,932 --> 00:55:25,599
'The shockwave will then
funnel up'

903
00:55:25,666 --> 00:55:28,069
creating a massive wave,
a mini tsunami.

904
00:55:28,136 --> 00:55:30,771
It'll hit Little Happy
with full force, point-blank

905
00:55:30,839 --> 00:55:32,474
and take the entire village
down.

906
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:34,109
And us with it.

907
00:55:34,175 --> 00:55:37,245
The only safe place for miles
will be their goddamn boat.

908
00:55:39,314 --> 00:55:42,317
- I need to talk to Richard.
- It won't make a difference.

909
00:55:42,383 --> 00:55:46,888
- Emma!
- Shaw. Stay put. I mean it.

910
00:55:54,896 --> 00:55:58,500
Were you gonna warn us? Or were
you just gonna let us drown?

911
00:55:58,566 --> 00:56:01,402
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about the mine.

912
00:56:03,404 --> 00:56:05,639
Emma..

913
00:56:05,706 --> 00:56:07,475
What mine?

914
00:56:07,542 --> 00:56:09,911
The one you put
in the nursery.

915
00:56:09,978 --> 00:56:12,780
Do you seriously think
I'm supposed to believe

916
00:56:12,847 --> 00:56:14,816
you didn't know anything
about it, Richard?

917
00:56:14,883 --> 00:56:16,784
'Or about cutting the satellite
com line?'

918
00:56:16,851 --> 00:56:19,220
I swear I don't know
what you're talking about.

919
00:56:20,654 --> 00:56:22,190
[intense music]

920
00:56:22,257 --> 00:56:23,825
Lucas.

921
00:56:25,393 --> 00:56:26,828
Hey.

922
00:56:29,297 --> 00:56:33,334
- What did you do?
- I followed orders.

923
00:56:33,401 --> 00:56:38,139
Find Bella, capture or kill her
offspring before they can breed

924
00:56:38,206 --> 00:56:41,176
which could be pretty much
any time now.

925
00:56:41,242 --> 00:56:43,811
They'll probably have
fucking hands by then.

926
00:56:43,878 --> 00:56:45,346
So I'm choosing "kill."

927
00:56:45,413 --> 00:56:48,183
Lucas, our orders didn't
include blowing anything up

928
00:56:48,249 --> 00:56:49,384
or murdering anybody.

929
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:52,854
Well, you really think
that they sent us here

930
00:56:52,921 --> 00:56:54,455
to develop drugs
for slow kids?

931
00:56:54,522 --> 00:56:57,892
Or what? So-so they can get As
and learn to play the oboe

932
00:56:57,959 --> 00:57:00,261
on their way to Harvard?

933
00:57:00,328 --> 00:57:03,398
Genotics Labs didn't send us
here to benefit mankind

934
00:57:03,464 --> 00:57:05,967
you dumb shit!

935
00:57:06,034 --> 00:57:07,502
They're just covering
their asses

936
00:57:07,569 --> 00:57:10,638
protecting their patents,
their stock price.

937
00:57:10,704 --> 00:57:14,509
Because the people-the people
who control everything now

938
00:57:14,576 --> 00:57:17,145
man, they will pay anything
so their kids

939
00:57:17,212 --> 00:57:19,514
can control everything
when all this starts

940
00:57:19,581 --> 00:57:20,982
to turn to shit.

941
00:57:21,049 --> 00:57:23,851
"Here you go, kid,
here's a billion dollars

942
00:57:23,918 --> 00:57:27,088
and 40 IQ points."

943
00:57:27,155 --> 00:57:29,723
See, it's all about
survival, folks.

944
00:57:32,393 --> 00:57:33,394
Get inside.

945
00:57:33,461 --> 00:57:35,563
And survival's all
about the money.

946
00:57:35,630 --> 00:57:36,831
Get inside! Go now!

947
00:57:36,898 --> 00:57:37,966
- Take cover!
- 'Shaw!'

948
00:57:38,032 --> 00:57:39,234
Not everyone gets to be a shark.

949
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,636
- Wait, no!
- Go! Go! Go!

950
00:57:41,703 --> 00:57:43,538
Faster, Spin!

951
00:57:43,605 --> 00:57:45,273
[intense music]

952
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:47,342

00:57:49,377 --> 00:57:51,312
[music continues]

955
00:57:52,413 --> 00:57:55,783
- No! Shaw, watch out!
- Shaw!

956
00:57:55,850 --> 00:57:57,352
[groans]

957
00:57:59,387 --> 00:58:01,055
[explosion]

958
00:58:03,157 --> 00:58:06,361
- Shaw!
- No, no!

959
00:58:06,427 --> 00:58:08,496
[explosions]

960
00:58:09,864 --> 00:58:11,966
Get down!

961
00:58:13,368 --> 00:58:15,403
[explosion]

962
00:58:21,509 --> 00:58:23,811
[buildings creaking]

00:58:27,448 --> 00:58:29,784
[explosion]

964
00:58:32,687 --> 00:58:33,855
- Lucas!
- Stop!

965
00:58:33,921 --> 00:58:36,124
What the hell are you doing?

966
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:39,260
What I'm paid to do.
Clean up the mess.

967
00:58:41,129 --> 00:58:42,530
[grunts]

968
00:58:42,597 --> 00:58:44,499
[explosion]

969
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:50,338
Fuck!

970
00:58:55,810 --> 00:58:57,445
We need to get higher.

971
00:58:57,512 --> 00:58:59,047
[grunting]

972
00:59:00,848 --> 00:59:04,085
No! Stop! Stop!
Let go!

973
00:59:05,953 --> 00:59:08,690
[screams]
Emma!

974
00:59:08,756 --> 00:59:11,225
Stop! No!

975
00:59:11,292 --> 00:59:12,960

00:59:33,681 --> 00:59:35,283
[music continues]

982
00:59:35,350 --> 00:59:37,018
- Emma, run!

983
00:59:37,085 --> 00:59:39,520
Take care of that, Schill!

984
00:59:39,587 --> 00:59:41,522
[explosion]

985
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,929

(Lucas) 'Where are our fucking
Einsteins when you fucking need them?'

987
00:59:55,370 --> 01:00:00,007
- No, no. We gotta get out!
- No! No! Spin! Spin! Spin!

988
01:00:00,074 --> 01:00:01,609
There are sharks out there!

989
01:00:01,676 --> 01:00:04,212
[music continues]

990
01:00:08,616 --> 01:00:10,551
Miya! Spin!

991
01:00:10,618 --> 01:00:12,887
- Shaw!
- Shaw!

992
01:00:12,954 --> 01:00:16,491
Shark! Stay inside!
I'll get you out!

993
01:00:21,763 --> 01:00:23,431
[gasps]

994
01:00:33,141 --> 01:00:35,209
- Shaw.
- Emma.

995
01:00:36,711 --> 01:00:39,614
[panting]
Shaw.

996
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,449
Are you alright? You good?

997
01:00:41,516 --> 01:00:43,050
- Yeah.
- Okay.

998
01:00:43,117 --> 01:00:45,386
- Miya. Spin?
- Inside.

999
01:00:46,687 --> 01:00:48,356
Oh, my God.

1000
01:00:48,423 --> 01:00:50,625
- Oh, my God, I can...
- Emma, don't press your luck.

1001
01:00:50,691 --> 01:00:52,193
The shark's right under there.

1002
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:54,328
If we don't defuse that mine,
none of us will make it.

1003
01:00:54,395 --> 01:00:56,063
The moment they get that ship
to a safe distance

1004
01:00:56,130 --> 01:00:58,199
they'll detonate it.

1005
01:00:58,266 --> 01:01:02,036
Look, you get Miya and Spin,
I'll get the mine.

1006
01:01:02,103 --> 01:01:03,638
No, you swim like a walrus,
I dive.

1007
01:01:03,704 --> 01:01:06,007
- Fine, whatever.
- When I find it, what do I do?

1008
01:01:06,073 --> 01:01:07,742
Get your ass back here, fast.

1009
01:01:07,810 --> 01:01:09,610
I'll figure out a way
to defuse it.

1010
01:01:09,677 --> 01:01:11,078
- Go.
- Okay.

1011
01:01:11,145 --> 01:01:13,147
[intense music]

1012
01:01:13,214 --> 01:01:15,950
[water splashing]

1013
01:01:21,489 --> 01:01:24,258
(Miya)
Careful, Shaw! Be careful!

1014
01:01:27,995 --> 01:01:30,531
[fire crackling]

1015
01:01:33,134 --> 01:01:35,838
- Miya.
- Shaw!

1016
01:01:35,904 --> 01:01:39,207
- Spin!
- Shaw!

1017
01:01:39,273 --> 01:01:42,911
- Shaw!
- Shaw!

1018
01:01:42,977 --> 01:01:45,713
[both shouting]
Shaw!

1019
01:01:45,781 --> 01:01:48,149
[music continues]

1020
01:02:10,873 --> 01:02:14,008
You know what to do.

1021
01:02:14,075 --> 01:02:15,576
Done.

1022
01:02:18,713 --> 01:02:20,515
Lucas, whatever you're
thinking about doing,

1023
01:02:20,581 --> 01:02:22,283
just stop, please!

1024
01:02:24,519 --> 01:02:27,321
You have a choice to make,
boss.

1025
01:02:27,388 --> 01:02:30,291
Stay on the ship
and collect your check

1026
01:02:30,358 --> 01:02:33,962
or you can join
your grad school crush.

1027
01:02:34,028 --> 01:02:36,464
Should be a no-brainer, Richard.

1028
01:02:36,531 --> 01:02:39,801
You know, these sharks
are more human than you are now.

1029
01:02:39,868 --> 01:02:41,736
'At least they care enough to
try and get their brother back.'

1030
01:02:41,803 --> 01:02:46,140
What do you care about, Lucas?
Getting out and getting paid.

1031
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:52,046
[intense music]

1032
01:02:54,816 --> 01:02:57,118
You're right.

1033
01:02:57,184 --> 01:02:59,253
It is a no-brainer.

1034
01:03:03,491 --> 01:03:05,059
No.

1035
01:03:05,126 --> 01:03:07,194
[music continues]

1036
01:03:07,261 --> 01:03:10,398
I would rather die with her
than live like you.

1037
01:03:15,269 --> 01:03:17,638
[screams]

1038
01:03:17,705 --> 01:03:19,307
[gasps]

1039
01:03:24,312 --> 01:03:26,347
Shark lover, eh?

1040
01:03:28,817 --> 01:03:31,385
Look at me. Dive.

1041
01:03:31,452 --> 01:03:33,387
Just dive.

1042
01:03:41,596 --> 01:03:43,331
Take it.

1043
01:03:45,901 --> 01:03:47,635
Breathe.

1044
01:03:47,702 --> 01:03:50,171
You got this.

1045
01:03:50,237 --> 01:03:51,772
[exhales]

1046
01:03:55,109 --> 01:03:57,111
Yeah.

1047
01:04:00,414 --> 01:04:02,650
Little tour before we go.

1048
01:04:08,155 --> 01:04:10,558
We'll go around the back.

1049
01:04:10,625 --> 01:04:13,160
[water gurgling]

1050
01:04:18,466 --> 01:04:20,334
Just you stay here, and, uh...

1051
01:04:20,401 --> 01:04:22,603
Wait, stay here?
You stay here.

1052
01:04:22,670 --> 01:04:25,306
No, we need to see if one
of those things is out there.

1053
01:04:26,407 --> 01:04:27,441
- Okay.
- Spin.

1054
01:04:27,508 --> 01:04:29,210
I'll be right back, okay?

1055
01:04:29,276 --> 01:04:34,148
- Spin. Promise me.
- I promise.

1056
01:04:34,215 --> 01:04:37,853
- Promise promise?

1060
01:05:07,049 --> 01:05:08,516
Shit.

1061
01:05:10,184 --> 01:05:13,121
Hey, neighbor.

1062
01:05:13,187 --> 01:05:14,655
Fuck.

[music continues]

1064
01:05:21,963 --> 01:05:23,764
Come on, man.

1065
01:05:27,401 --> 01:05:29,437
You ain't gotta do this.

1066
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:32,740

1068
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:40,115
Come on, old man.

1069
01:05:40,182 --> 01:05:42,750
Let's see what you got.

1070
01:05:42,818 --> 01:05:46,454
What'd you say?
I left my hearing aide inside.

1071
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:48,389
Why don't you come
a little closer, sonny?

1072
01:05:48,456 --> 01:05:50,826
- Sonny?
- 'Yeah, that's right.'

1073
01:05:50,892 --> 01:05:52,393
Yeah.

1074
01:05:55,262 --> 01:05:57,598

[music continues]

1080
01:06:34,202 --> 01:06:36,905

[crying]

1082
01:06:38,439 --> 01:06:40,341
One of them's
right out there.

1083
01:06:40,407 --> 01:06:42,510
- Okay? We gotta hide.
- Hide?

1084
01:06:42,576 --> 01:06:44,745
- Now.
- Hide where? [crying]

1085
01:06:47,115 --> 01:06:50,085
[intense music]

1086
01:06:50,152 --> 01:06:51,887
Oh, shit! Holy shit!

1087
01:06:53,521 --> 01:06:56,925
Go upstairs! Go, go, go!

1088
01:06:59,995 --> 01:07:03,430
[gasping]
Here, come on!

1089
01:07:03,497 --> 01:07:06,034
Shit, shit, shit.

[grunting]

1093
01:07:31,392 --> 01:07:34,162
I was expecting more from you,
old man!

1094
01:07:34,229 --> 01:07:36,630
That was way too easy.

1095
01:07:36,697 --> 01:07:39,034
Now, come on. Get up.

1096
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:41,002
[groaning]

1097
01:07:41,069 --> 01:07:42,703
Get up!

[grunting]

1099
01:07:49,343 --> 01:07:53,048
Fuck.
The beacon.

1100
01:07:56,251 --> 01:08:01,189
Miya, I gotta tell you
something, 'cause if I don't..

1101
01:08:01,256 --> 01:08:06,694
[panting] All my life, I've been,
like, afraid, of everything.

1102
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:09,965
And-and, and then I met you.

1103
01:08:10,031 --> 01:08:10,999
[chuckles]

1104
01:08:11,066 --> 01:08:13,335
And you make me less afraid.

1105
01:08:13,434 --> 01:08:15,170
And I love that.

1106
01:08:15,237 --> 01:08:18,206
And I love that-that
you laugh at my jokes

1107
01:08:18,273 --> 01:08:19,941
even though they're not funny.

1108
01:08:20,008 --> 01:08:21,742
And I love that
you make fun of me

1109
01:08:21,810 --> 01:08:25,412
when I say stupid stuff,
which is, like, all the time.

1110
01:08:25,479 --> 01:08:30,618
And... I just love
how you make me feel.

1111
01:08:30,684 --> 01:08:33,721
And, uh,
when we get out of this

1112
01:08:33,788 --> 01:08:37,058
and we will get out of this,
I promise

1113
01:08:37,125 --> 01:08:39,794
when we do..

1114
01:08:39,861 --> 01:08:43,031
I'd really like to hang out
with you some more.

1115
01:08:43,098 --> 01:08:44,732

1116
01:08:49,603 --> 01:08:51,973
[panting]

1117
01:08:53,574 --> 01:08:55,576
It's okay.

1118
01:08:58,746 --> 01:09:01,715
- Oh. Spin.
- Holy shit!

1119
01:09:01,783 --> 01:09:04,618
There is blood.
It's everywhere.

1120
01:09:17,265 --> 01:09:18,565
That was close.

1121
01:09:18,632 --> 01:09:21,169

Earl!

1125
01:09:40,454 --> 01:09:42,556
Finish this piece of shit.

1126
01:09:44,426 --> 01:09:45,961
Then get back to the ship.

1128
01:09:50,464 --> 01:09:51,433

Not a coffin,
not a coffin.

Not a coffin, not a coffin.

1137

- Ah!
- Miya!

1141
01:11:00,001 --> 01:11:01,136
Argh!

'Shaw, can you hear me? Shaw?'

1163
01:13:02,223 --> 01:13:05,426
- Emma?
- 'Where are you? Come in.'

1164
01:13:08,096 --> 01:13:11,299
- Emma!
- 'Shaw? Oh, God, Shaw.'

1165
01:13:13,935 --> 01:13:17,872
'Listen to me.
I need your help.'

1166
01:13:17,939 --> 01:13:20,808
Emma, those bulls
are right on top of you.

1167
01:13:20,875 --> 01:13:24,711
Yeah, no shit.
I have the mine.

1168
01:13:24,779 --> 01:13:26,548
And these two bulls
know what it is.

1169
01:13:26,614 --> 01:13:27,849
What do you mean?

1170
01:13:27,916 --> 01:13:29,384
'Richard said
they used explosives'

1171
01:13:29,450 --> 01:13:32,220

1172
01:13:32,287 --> 01:13:34,055

Shaw! The Thasos,
it's about to leave!

1175
01:13:55,276 --> 01:13:58,279
Emma, Lucas is about to go,
he can blow the mine

1176
01:13:58,346 --> 01:14:00,548
at any moment,
you need to disarm it.

01:14:44,225 --> 01:14:47,295
Thanks, Shaw.
And so sorry.

1186
01:14:47,362 --> 01:14:51,332
- Sorry? Sorry about what, Emma?
- 'Something I gotta do.'

1187
01:14:51,399 --> 01:14:54,435
- What?
- 'You won't like it. Bye.'

1188
01:14:54,502 --> 01:14:57,771
Bye? No, not bye.
What do you mean, "Bye"?

1189
01:14:59,173 --> 01:15:00,808

Miss me?

1197
01:15:46,988 --> 01:15:49,190

1199
01:16:00,868 --> 01:16:03,137
Lucas.

1200
01:16:03,204 --> 01:16:05,473
In his hand,
he's got the detonator.

1201
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:09,877
Where's the mine?

01:16:53,688 --> 01:16:56,958
Let's get out of here.
We can all agree on that, right?

1210
01:16:57,024 --> 01:16:58,326
- We'll take my boat.
- Alright.

1211
01:16:58,393 --> 01:17:00,428
I'll get some freshwater,
some supplies.

1212
01:17:00,495 --> 01:17:03,464
Emma?

1213
01:17:03,531 --> 01:17:05,099
I can't leave.

1214
01:17:05,166 --> 01:17:08,336
What are you talking about?

1215
01:17:08,403 --> 01:17:10,738
I'm not asking either one of you
to stay, but I can't go,

1216
01:17:10,806 --> 01:17:12,206
not until it's over.

1217
01:17:12,273 --> 01:17:16,644
It is goddamn over.
We're alive, guys.

1218
01:17:16,711 --> 01:17:19,914
So are those bulls. Richard and
that asshole Lucas were right.

1219
01:17:19,981 --> 01:17:22,150
If those things mate..

1220
01:17:22,216 --> 01:17:23,518
...we don't know
what they could become.

1221
01:17:23,584 --> 01:17:25,186
They're right?
What are you talking about?

1222
01:17:25,253 --> 01:17:27,522
You spent your entire life
trying to save sharks.

1223
01:17:27,588 --> 01:17:30,224
I know, but..

1224
01:17:30,291 --> 01:17:32,960
- But what?
- This is bigger than us.

1225
01:17:33,027 --> 01:17:35,029
Not our responsibility, ladies.

1226
01:17:35,096 --> 01:17:37,698
Well, if it's not our
responsibility, Shaw, whose?

1227
01:17:39,835 --> 01:17:44,038
We're the only ones on Earth
who can stop them... right now.

1228
01:17:44,105 --> 01:17:46,240
We're not gonna get
another chance.

[scoffs]

1230
01:17:49,944 --> 01:17:52,113
My dad never backed away
from a fight.

1231
01:17:53,882 --> 01:17:57,952
He just fought harder.
What about you?

1232
01:18:00,388 --> 01:18:03,892
You gotta be fucking
kidding me, Emma.

1233
01:18:03,958 --> 01:18:05,660
So how will you find
these monsters?

1234
01:18:05,726 --> 01:18:09,932
Exactly. They're gone,
they could be miles away by now.

1235
01:18:09,997 --> 01:18:12,633
They're not monsters,
we did this to them.

01:18:21,476 --> 01:18:24,579
- Shark's GPS beacon.
- Not just any shark.

Bella. Their mother.

their brains even imprinted

1240

on this specific frequency,
they followed it like instinct

1241
01:18:35,623 --> 01:18:36,825
I saw it myself. Alright?

1242
01:18:36,892 --> 01:18:41,429
To these bulls...
this beacon is their mother.

1243
01:18:42,931 --> 01:18:44,499
I don't get it.

1244
01:18:48,135 --> 01:18:50,271
I'm not going after them.

1245

I'm gonna attach this
to the drone

1249
01:19:07,555 --> 01:19:09,590
bring them into the cove,
right past your house

1250
01:19:09,657 --> 01:19:12,260

and around and around

1251

It's stuck on something.
