them the Willie Lynch papers.

732
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,829
It's powerful stuff, man.

733
00:45:06,138 --> 00:45:11,186
The term lynching, they got it
from his name.

734
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:14,494
Say he was a master of keeping
slaves in line,

735
00:45:14,537 --> 00:45:19,760
so American slave owners asked
him to share his secret.

736
00:45:19,804 --> 00:45:24,939
In Virginia, 300 years ago, he
gave this speech.

737
00:45:24,983 --> 00:45:26,462
He says, I have a foolproof
method

738
00:45:26,506 --> 00:45:28,638
for controlling your slaves.

739
00:45:28,682 --> 00:45:33,469
I use fear, distrust, and envy
for control purposes.

740
00:45:33,513 --> 00:45:38,039
He says, distrust is stronger
than trust,

741
00:45:38,083 --> 00:45:40,694
and envy is stronger than
adulation,

742
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:45,786
respect, or admiration.

743
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:47,483
You must pitch the old black
male

744
00:45:47,527 --> 00:45:50,878
against a young black male, and
the young black male

745
00:45:50,922 --> 00:45:53,054
against the old black male.

746
00:45:53,098 --> 00:45:55,013
You must use the female against
the male,

747
00:45:55,056 --> 00:45:58,277
and you must use the male
against the female.

748
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,235
You must use a dark skinned
slave

749
00:46:00,279 --> 00:46:03,282
against a light skinned slave.

750
00:46:03,325 --> 00:46:05,545
It is necessary that your slaves
love,

751
00:46:05,588 --> 00:46:09,592
respect, and trust only us.

752
00:46:09,636 --> 00:46:12,247
Says, the black slave, after
receiving this indoctrination,

753
00:46:12,291 --> 00:46:18,123
shall carry on for hundreds of
years, maybe thousands.

01:29:37,546 --> 01:29:40,462
in my shoes. More than holes in
my shoes.

1623
01:29:40,505 --> 01:29:42,594
Everybody's in a hurry to get to
nowhere.

1624
01:29:42,638 --> 01:29:44,030
A young child is crying.

1625
01:29:44,074 --> 01:29:45,510
Her mother don't care.

1626
01:29:45,554 --> 01:29:48,339
No milk in the bottle, but she
gets welfare for food.

1627
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:50,559
Welfare for food.

1628
01:29:50,602 --> 01:29:52,952
The world keep turning but the
fire's burning out.

1629
01:29:52,996 --> 01:29:55,215
I guess I'll take another trip
down to the rock house.

1630
01:29:55,259 --> 01:29:58,349
The only place I go where
everybody knows my name.

1631
01:29:58,393 --> 01:30:00,133
They know my name.

1632
01:30:00,177 --> 01:30:02,614
You know I feel so high when I'm
in bliss.

1633
01:30:02,658 --> 01:30:05,574
I would sell my soul for just
one more hit.

1634
01:30:05,617 --> 01:30:08,054
I'll do anything to escape this
pain.

1635
01:30:08,098 --> 01:30:10,492
Oh yeah.

1636
01:30:10,535 --> 01:30:12,015
[MUSIC - WYCLEF JEAN,
"PRESIDENT"]

1637
01:30:12,058 --> 01:30:14,147
[SINGING] Election time's
coming.

1638
01:30:14,191 --> 01:30:16,585
Who you gonna vote for?

1639
01:30:16,628 --> 01:30:18,543
Yeah.

1640
01:30:18,587 --> 01:30:23,983
If I was president, I'd get
elected on Friday, assassinated

1641
01:30:24,027 --> 01:30:28,118
on Saturday, buried on Sunday.

1642
01:30:28,161 --> 01:30:30,686
They go back to work on Monday.

1643
01:30:30,729 --> 01:30:33,253
If I was president.

1644
01:30:33,297 --> 01:30:35,517
If I was president.

1645
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:39,999
If I was president, yeah.

1646
01:30:40,043 --> 01:30:43,481
Instead of spending billions on
the war,

1647
01:30:43,525 --> 01:30:48,225
I can use that money so I can
feed the poor.

1648
01:30:48,268 --> 01:30:51,707
'Cause I know some so poor, when
it rains,

1649
01:30:51,750 --> 01:30:53,056
that's when the shower.

1650
01:30:53,099 --> 01:30:55,928
Screaming, fight the power.

1651
01:30:55,972 --> 01:30:58,104
That's when the vulture
devoured.

1652
01:30:58,148 --> 01:31:03,545
If I was president, I'd get
elected on Friday, assassinated

1653
01:31:03,588 --> 01:31:07,070
on Saturday, buried on Sunday.

1654
01:31:07,113 --> 01:31:09,551
They go back to work on Monday.

1655
01:31:09,594 --> 01:31:11,509
If I was president.

1656
01:31:11,553 --> 01:31:14,686
If I was president.

1657
01:31:14,730 --> 01:31:16,514
If I was president.

1658
01:31:16,558 --> 01:31:18,647
Yeah.

1659
01:31:18,690 --> 01:31:22,520
I know some soldiers that sleep,
but they can't dream.

1660
01:31:22,564 --> 01:31:27,873
Wake up with screams, sounds of
M-16s.

1661
01:31:27,917 --> 01:31:32,269
So take this medal of honor for
your bravery.

1662
01:31:32,312 --> 01:31:35,490
I wish you the best, kid.

1663
01:31:35,533 --> 01:31:37,100
You and your family.

1664
01:31:37,143 --> 01:31:42,192
If I was president, I'd get
elected on Friday, assassinated

1665
01:31:42,235 --> 01:31:46,152
on Saturday, buried on Sunday.

1666
01:31:46,196 --> 01:31:49,068
They go back to work on Monday.

1667
01:31:49,112 --> 01:31:51,549
If I was president.

1668
01:31:51,593 --> 01:31:53,986
If I was president.

1669
01:31:54,030 --> 01:31:55,945
If I was president.

1670
01:31:55,988 --> 01:31:58,904
But the radio won't play this.

1671
01:31:58,948 --> 01:32:01,341
They call it rebel music.

1672
01:32:01,385 --> 01:32:06,303
How can you refuse it, children
of Moses?

1673
01:32:06,346 --> 01:32:09,349
Tell the children the truth, the
truth.

1674
01:32:09,393 --> 01:32:10,437
It's not all that bling.

1675
01:32:10,481 --> 01:32:11,569
That's diamonds.

1676
01:32:11,613 --> 01:32:14,224
Tell them the truth, the truth.

1677
01:32:14,267 --> 01:32:16,574
Most of y'all wear cubic
zirconium.

1678
01:32:16,618 --> 01:32:18,184
Tell them the truth, the truth.

1679
01:32:18,228 --> 01:32:19,534
Yeah.

1680
01:32:19,577 --> 01:32:21,231
Your soul is worth more than
diamonds and gold.

1681
01:32:21,274 --> 01:32:23,755
If I was president, all blacks
will have

1682
01:32:23,799 --> 01:32:25,278
reparation, no segregation.

1683
01:32:25,322 --> 01:32:26,845
Feed the nation 'til there's no
famine.

1684
01:32:26,889 --> 01:32:29,065
Muslims, Jews, Christians would
all hold hands.

1685
01:32:29,108 --> 01:32:31,154
Every week on the beach, party
by the sane.

1686
01:32:31,197 --> 01:32:32,068
Word up.

1687
01:32:32,111 --> 01:32:33,765
Take trips on Air Force One.

1688
01:32:33,809 --> 01:32:35,550
No need to bring the homeless
with no sneaks

1689
01:32:35,593 --> 01:32:36,812
to Air Force One.

1690
01:32:36,855 --> 01:32:38,727
Better schools in the hood,
better teachers

1691
01:32:38,770 --> 01:32:39,641
for the classes.

1692
01:32:39,684 --> 01:32:41,207
Making money, paying no taxes.

1693
01:32:41,251 --> 01:32:42,469
Find the best scientists.

1694
01:32:42,513 --> 01:32:44,123
Tell them, come up with the
answer.

1695
01:32:44,167 --> 01:32:46,082
I want the cure for AIDS and
cancer.

1696
01:32:46,125 --> 01:32:47,605
But I gotta watch my back.

1697
01:32:47,649 --> 01:32:50,739
Snipers on the hill with the
steel.
