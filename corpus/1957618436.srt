106
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,696
- Enjoyed, Sauris?

107
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,233
I did not enjoy what I saw today.

108
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:57,103
I saw heartbreak, I saw death and destruction.

109
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:58,137
Never again.

110
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:03,175
I'll not leave my subjects or my children

111
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,177
with a blood-soaked kingdom.

112
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,613
- Are you suggesting a treaty with the Morlins, sir?

113
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:09,882
- What use are treaties?

114
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,350
We've been at war with the Morlin kingdom

115
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,252
for more centuries than I can recall.

116
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:16,689
It's been a never-ending cycle of bloodshed.

117
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:20,893
And why, to right some half-forgotten ancient wrong!

118
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,629
For greed, power,

119
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:29,068
nothing justifies the pain I saw today.

120
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:30,303
- You seem to ask the impossible,

121
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:33,039
we cannot change man's nature!

122
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,274
- There is a way,

123
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,243
there must be a way.

124
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:40,112
I want a world where art and ideas

125
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:44,684
are held in higher regard than brute force.

126
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,120
Aeschylus, old friend,

127
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,692
you've remained very silent, can you help me?

128
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:55,328
- (groans) It seems that you desire not

129
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:59,231
just the end of this particular struggle with the Morlins,

130
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:03,035
but a complete eradication of the species of war!

131
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,972
- Yes, that is what I want. (crowd murmuring)

132
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,773
Can you give me that?

133
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,043
- You ask the impossible.

134
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,179
- You're a good man, Aeschylus.

135
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:15,815
Whatever you have to do, do it.

136
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:19,352
- As you wish. (crowd murmuring)

137
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:21,287
(tense and ominous orchestral music)

138
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,257
- Look how frail he is, Jarad, how weak!

139
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,427
Our time is drawing near, I feel it!

140
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,464
When my powers are unleashed,

141
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:35,334
Aralon will crumble like a house of cards!

142
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:39,338
(tense and ominous orchestral music)

143
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:44,744
- You babbling goons! (mops squishing)

144
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,946
I've never seen such pathetic excuses

145
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,248
for human beings in all my life,

146
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:50,983
eh, your highness,

147
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:54,820
and if I were king, you could kiss my royal, your highness!

148
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,355
(servant shouting over muffled chatter)

149
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:57,456

(man groans over clanging pan)

155
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:07,266
I-if you'll pardon me for just a moment,

156
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:11,404
I have someone I need to, uh, ee, uh, strangle.

157
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:13,305
(Stephanie laughing over rattling and clamor)

158
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,240

(Francis sighs)

163
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:33,059
- Mira, help me do the right thing, my love,

164
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:37,396
but there are no answers in the dark,

165
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:42,334
and the nights are so cold without you.

166
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:46,205

171
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,473

(Aeschylus grunts)

178
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:51,504
- Now what do you say about my parlor games, old man?

179
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:54,006
You're doing really well, my pet.

180
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:58,577
(cat purring over ominous and eerie orchestral music)

181
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,446
Show me everything.

00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:34,113
(cat purring over ominous orchestral music)

188
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,353
(birds chirping over whinneying horses)

189
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,289
(horse sighs)

190
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:47,493
(birds chirping over whinneying horses)

191
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:54,133
(horses sighing)

192
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:57,236
- [Alexander] Look out! (swords tinging)

193
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:59,638
(men grunting and shouting over tinging swords)

194
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,107
- [Don] I gotcha (laughs)!

195
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:06,312
(men grunting over tinging swords)

196
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:08,547
Look out, here!

197
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:12,651
- Alexander, when will you teach me to fight with a sword?

198
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,587
- Soon as you're big enough to carry one!

199
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,521
(men laughing)

200
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:18,090
(Alexander grunting over tinging swords)

201
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:20,059
- But I am big enough! (horse whinneying)

202
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:21,327
It isn't fair!

203
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,429
- Life isn't fair, boy! (swords tinging)

204
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:25,030
I'll tell you what, though.

205
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:27,600
If you're lucky, I'll let you polish my sword

206
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:30,603
when I finish hammering this lout!

207
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,271
(both shouting)

208
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:35,241
(horse whinneying over tinging swords)

209
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:36,675
(men grunting)

210
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,177
(Alexander sighs over swords crunching into soil)

211
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,579
(Alexander laughs)

212
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:43,215
Why not teach the boy to fight, Alexander?

213
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,517
- I will, of course, Don.

214
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,354
He's in such a rush to grow up.

215
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:52,358
I wouldn't mind having his problems (scoffs) for a day.

216
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,627
(birds chirping)

217
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,561
(sword tings)

218
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:58,731
- Yeah, me, too (shouts)!

219
00:14:58,764 --> 00:14:59,965
(swords tinging)

220
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:03,068
(both laughing)

221
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,337
(crickets chirping over dramatic orchestral music)

222
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:06,605
- [Elder] We've got it this time, yeah.

223
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,607
Yeah, it should work.

224
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,010
- [All] Mm.

225
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:17,016
(men groaning over dramatic orchestral music)

226
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:18,117
(explosion cracking)

227
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:21,620
(men coughing and groaning)

228
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:33,132
- I don't understand, master.

229
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:35,601
- There's no reason why you would understand, my friend.

230
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:39,038
Our mission is one that taunts the laws of science.

231
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:41,240
We're playing with mysterious forces.

232
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,542
- I still don't understand.

233
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:50,049
- Nor do I, my friend, (sighs) nor do I.

234
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:53,719
(expressive orchestral music)

235
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,607
- Some dinner, sir?

236
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,211
Some dinner, sir?

237
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:25,084
(liquid bubbling)

238
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:29,088
(servant gasping over shattering glass)

239
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:32,224
(owl hooting)

240
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:34,793
(sand pattering)

241
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:42,434
(Aeschylus clears his throat)

242
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:48,741
(sand pattering over eerie orchestral accent)

243
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,442
- [Assistant] Hmm?

244
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:54,646
(sand pattering over eerie and tense orchestral music)

245
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:02,688
- Yes (gasps).

246
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:07,359
(rousing orchestral music)

247
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,530
- My God, Aeschylus, you look terrible!

248
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,533
I assume you have some urgent news

249
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:16,468
to summon the court in this manner.

250
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:20,305
(rousing orchestral music)

251
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,541
What is this curiosity?

252
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:25,411
- A blessing, a curse, a proposal.

253
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:31,417
I don't know, a gift perhaps.

254
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,851
- Is this some kind of riddle?

255
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,353
- Riddle, sire?

256
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,623
Not exactly, this object will be

257
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:41,560
the single most powerful device ever imagined!

258
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:42,895
(crowd murmuring)

259
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:46,598
A device that will not only end war,

260
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:49,468
but make it a virtual impossibility!

261
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:52,171
(sheet whooshing)

262
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:54,373
- [Onlooker] It's a clock!

263
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:58,644
- Is this some kind of joke?

264
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:02,247
(crowd murmuring)

265
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:06,452
- My king, what I hold in my hands is time itself,

266
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:11,690
and I have harnessed its power.

267
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,426
He who masters time

268
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:20,799
masters the entire universe! (crowd murmuring)

269
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:24,803
- Are you telling me that if we build this device,

270
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:25,771
we control time?

271
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:31,410
- When activated, you can watch your enemies

272
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,846
age and die before your eyes.

273
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:38,717
Lifetimes are reduced to weeks, hours become seconds.

274
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:46,458
The universal force would be yours to command.

275
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:49,795
- The Morlins would be completely at our mercy, my lord.

276
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:53,732
- And we would be prisoners in our own castle.

277
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:56,568
Is there no other way?

278
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:58,637
- Well, the hope would be that the threat alone

279
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,772
would, uh, deter any aggression.

280
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,842
(crowd murmuring)

281
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:09,715
- And I would be in a position to destroy all my enemies.

282
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:10,816
Is that it?

283
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:12,618
- Indeed, my liege.

284
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:19,892
- No man has the right to play at being God.

285
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,593
Destroy it, Aeschylus.

286
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:25,797
(crowd murmuring over dramatic orchestral music)

287
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:33,872
Oh, my friend, no one in this world can match your power,

288
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,877
and I thank you for the loyal service

289
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,979
you've shown to the throne,

290
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,816
but I cannot accept this gift.

291
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,953
- (sighs) Thank God.

292
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:53,358
(groans) Despite all the capabilities of science and magic,

293
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:59,364
I never cease to be amazed at the human heart.

294
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:04,703
I hope you find your answer. (dramatic orchestral music)

295
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:07,406
- What's wrong, Papa?

296
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:10,509
(flowing and dramatic orchestral music)

297
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:14,713
- (sighs) To lead, one has to make decisions.

298
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:20,052
I just hope I made the right one back in the hall.

299
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:22,621
- The clock scared me, Papa.

300
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,758
- Me, too, little princess.

301
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:31,897
You know, even though our lives are short,

302
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,967
what we do with them can last forever.

303
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,438
Your mother is gone, but the love she left behind

304
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:42,307
lives on in my heart and in yours.

305
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:44,977
- I miss her.

306
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:50,549
- I miss her, too, very much.

307
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:00,559
Sometimes when I look in your eyes,

308
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,463
I see her looking back at me.

309
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:10,836
I love you, little princess.

310
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:14,906
(expressive orchestral music)

311
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,643
Here, I'm gonna give you this.

312
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:22,581
This was your mother's ring.

313
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,717
A diamond is a little like true love.

314
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:30,922
Nothing can break or tarnish its face if it is pure.

315
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:33,558
Love

316
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,397
is the most powerful force there is.

317
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:42,601
(expressive orchestral music with tinkling chimes)

318
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:51,777
(liquid bubbling over ominous orchestral music)

319
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:00,719
(Aeschylus sighs)

320
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:06,491
(liquid bubbling)

321
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:09,061
(whooshing electronic accent)

322
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:12,064
(fire crackling)

323
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:15,100
(crickets chriping)

324
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:22,007
- I know your secret, Aeschylus,

325
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,876
and I will not shrink from them as you have.

326
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,547
The knowledge that you have denied me, I have taken.

327
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:32,684
Oh, and now is the moment that I've been waiting for!

328
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,955
Let the forces of nature tremble

329
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:40,525
as I summon the winds and the rains

330
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,097
to paralyze this stagnant, dying kingdom once and for all!

331
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:49,501
(thunder cracking over dramatic and tense orchestral music)

332
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:58,176
(shutters cracking)

333
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,979
- (groans) What is this?

334
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:04,983
(Aeschylus groaning over dramatic, tense orchestral music)

335
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,057
(Aeschylus grunts)

336
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:15,460
(Aeschylus sighs)

337
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:18,163
(door creaking)

338
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:20,532
Who's there?

339
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:25,570
(horse whinneying over dramatic and tense orchestral music)

340
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:29,641
(muffled shouting)

341
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:34,212
(soldiers shouting)

342
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:39,718
- You taught me well, master.

343
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,154
- No, Karnissa, you can't!

344
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:44,523
The magic is too much for you!

345
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:47,926
- No, it would appear the magic is too much for you.

346
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:50,529
My powers have been mocked for too long.

347
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:52,497
Jarod, dispose of the old fool (Aeschylus moaning)

348
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:54,065
and take everything with you.

349
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,101
- Aren't you forgetting something?

350
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:57,736
(thunder rumbling over howling wind)

351
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,238
This is quite a storm, Karnissa.

352
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:03,508
I didn't think you had it in you.

353
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:04,709
- Why, Sauris?

354
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:10,148
You always were one step ahead of everyone else.

355
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:12,951
- My talent has always been aligning myself

356
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:15,987
with those who have the power,

357
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:20,258
and right now, my dear, you are very powerful.

358
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:23,795
- And what's to stop you from betraying me?

359
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:24,963
- I never mentioned anything

360
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:28,233
about the queen's untimely demise, did I,

361
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:29,701
though I would have spoken

362
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:32,003
had it been in my interest to do so.

363
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:35,240
I knew the king had rejected your advances.

364
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:36,608
For me, it has never been a matter

365
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,977
of if you return, just when.

366
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:44,316
- All right, Sauris, you can come with us.

367
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:47,752
Gentlemen, we have quite a journey ahead of us.

368
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:51,957
(soldiers shouting over dramatic and tense orchestral music)

369
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:56,561
(ship whooshing)

370
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:57,996
- The storm is subsiding.

371
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:00,765
- Fool, I control the storm,

372
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,168
and it still rages on the castle.

373
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:05,937
No more delays, we must set sail for Gamara.

374
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:09,207
(soldiers shouting over dramatic and tense orchestral music)

375
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:12,577
- Magnificent, how shall I assist you?

376
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:15,814
- Now that we are out of the castle, I have no need for you.

377
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:16,882
- What do you mean?

378
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:18,617
(tense orchestral music)

379
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,285
Stop, what are you doing?

380
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:23,288
- I despise liars and flatterers.

381
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:27,826
(Sauris shouting over tense orchestral music)

382
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,995
You can't trust any of them.

383
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,564
(wind howling)

384
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:38,069
(bird cawing over rustling wind)

385
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:40,939
- Master, are you all right?

386
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:42,040
(platter clangs to the floor)

387
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:45,310
(expressive vocal choir)

388
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:15,340
- Aeschylus, old friend,

389
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:19,110
I hope you find greater joy in the next world

390
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,813
than you did in this lonely place.

391
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:24,849
(expressive violin)

392
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:27,953
(James sighs)

393
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:30,989
(expressive violin)

394
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:34,159
(Stephanie sneezes)

395
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:36,861
(James sneezes)

396
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:38,129
Bless you.

397
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:42,000
(expressive orchestral music)

398
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:51,910
- You know, I happen to be a good friend of the princess,

399
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,412
and I couldn't help but notice the goo-goo eyes

400
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,780
you were making at her.

401
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:57,215
- I was not!

402
00:26:57,248 --> 00:27:00,318
- (laughs) Poop, you looked like a hypnotized dog.

403
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:03,788
(Loffo mimics dog panting and howling)

404
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:07,993
(laughs) Oh, come now, don't pout over it!

405
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:11,229
(lion growling)

406
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:13,131
- (clears throat) My Lord,

407
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:16,067
there's no sign of the astrologer nor of Sauris.

408
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:17,268
- From the look of their quarters,

409
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,903
it appears they left in quite a rush.

410
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:20,372
- When was she last seen?

411
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:22,440
- When you first, sir, heard about the Clock of Time.

412
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:25,276
- (groans) My God.

413
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:29,280
Well, at least the plans for the device were destroyed.

414
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,952
Are you telling me that the plans are still out there?

415
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,787
- It seems entirely possible

416
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,390
and, in this case, probable.

417
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:39,424
- Oh my God!

418
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:44,863
Oh, Aeschylus, my friend, what have we started?

419
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:49,968
(ominous rumbling ambiance)

420
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:53,471
(dramatic orchestral music)

421
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:05,250
- And the fires of hell spewed forth,

422
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:09,087
cleansing the land of all stagnation.

423
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,291
Welcome home, my friend (cackles).

424
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,329
(bear roaring)

425
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:23,401
(bear groaning over pleasant orchestral music)

426
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:35,947
(ferret squeaking)

427
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:45,290
(bird cawing)

428
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:47,158
(platter rattling)

429
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:48,860
(Loffo gasping)

430
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:52,063
(footsteps pattering)

431
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:55,567
(Loffo laughs)

432
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,235
- Loffo, what are you doing?

433
00:28:57,268 --> 00:28:59,037
The stable master will kill me if I'm late again!

434
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,871
- Poo!

435
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,106
- What is this?

436
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:03,007
- [Loffo] Some food for the princess.

437
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:04,242
- And?

438
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:06,144
- Take it to her, you work for me now,

439
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:08,446
and I'm sending you on this errand.

440
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,215
- Loffo, don't make me, please!

441
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,517
- This is a golden opportunity, eh?

442
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:15,386
Don't fall apart on me now.

443
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,855
(Loffo laughs)

444
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:19,891
You'd think I was asking you to feed a dragon!

445
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:22,093
- [James] But what do I say?

446
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:23,094
(cat meows)

447
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:24,896
- Mm, look at this hat!

448
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,464
Look, it's so cute!

449
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:29,834
Let's try another one. (animals chattering)

450
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:32,137
That looks really good, hmm.

451
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:35,473
(James sighing)

452
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:40,879
That looks good! (animals chattering)

453
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:43,348
Oh, no, my ring (gasps)!

454
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:46,451
(platter clattering)

455
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:49,420
(knocking on door)

456
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,855
(parrot squawking)

457
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:53,958
(animals chattering over knocking on door)

458
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:56,361
(James sighs)

459
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:57,996
(thumping on door)

460
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:59,430
(animals chattering)

461
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,465
(Stephanie grunts)

462
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:02,066
(James clears his throat)

463
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,001
(door creaking)

464
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:04,502
What on Earth is it?

465
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:08,173
- Your dinner, your highness.

466
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:09,374
- Bring it in.

467
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:15,480
(animals chattering)

468
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:17,448
You can put it over there on the table.

469
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,317
(animals chattering)

470
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:22,420
(bird fluttering over animal chatter)

471
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:23,922
- Um,

472
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:24,656
your highness?

473
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:27,992
(animals chattering)

474
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:31,129
- You look funny!

475
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:34,566
They really seem to like you.

476
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:38,970
(James sighing over chattering animals)

477
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:48,246
- Well, I know you must be busy, so.

478
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:52,116
- I'm actually looking for something.

479
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:55,420
- (scoffs) It's funny.

480
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:57,956
My mom used to say that rings have a habit of

481
00:30:57,989 --> 00:31:01,459
falling under beds. (animals chattering)

482
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:03,261
- Really?

483
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:05,597
- Yeah, I-I'll be going, here.

484
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:08,233
Sorry to have bothered you.

485
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:11,703
(animals chattering over pleasant orchestral music)

486
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:14,439
(James sighs)

487
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:18,309
- Wait a minute!

488
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:22,213
How did you know I was looking for a ring?

489
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:25,383
- Why did I say that (grunts)?

490
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:29,587
(animals chattering over pleasant, flowing orchestral music)

491
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:43,334
(ethereal chime accent)

492
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:46,571
(animals chattering over pleasant, flowing orchestral music)

493
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:48,673
(ominous orchestral music and vocal choir)

494
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:53,077
(men shouting and grunting over pounding hammers)

495
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:02,553
(machinery whirring over muffled shouting)

496
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:06,057
- My God, don't, don't you see?

497
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:09,594
After one full revolution of this machine,

498
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:12,230
the process cannot be stopped!

499
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,232
Even, even if it is destroyed,

500
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:18,503
the forces that are set into play are irreversible!

501
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:21,506
- D-do you think she's insane enough to use it?

502
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:23,341
I mean, she could have whatever she wants

503
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:25,510
simply by building it, I don't see why--

504
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:26,678
(slaps thwacking)

505
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:27,745
- Over there!

506
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:31,416
- Jarad! (ominous orchestral music)

507
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,017
- Yes, my queen?

508
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:34,519
- Are we on schedule?

509
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:37,588
- Not quite, this is a very difficult

510
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,091
and complicated device, my queen.

511
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,126
- I supposedly have the greatest mystical

512
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,330
and scientific minds at work 24 hours a day.

513
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:48,066
The problem is is that you've not been

514
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:50,034
properly motivating them!

515
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:52,470
(Jarad grunts)

516
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:54,339
- What do you suggest?

517
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:59,677
- Set an example of what happens if they don't work harder.

518
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:00,712
- How my queen? (machinery clanking)

519
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:03,748
- Guards! (tense orchestral music)

520
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:05,717
- No, no, my queen!

521
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:09,253
I beg mercy, please, call them off!

522
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:12,757
- If this machine is not completed within two days,

523
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:15,126
Jarad's fate will be yours!

524
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:19,330
(Jarad screaming over tense orchestral music)

525
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:24,602
Mazer? (machinery clanking)

526
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:26,671
- Yes, my queen?

527
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:29,307
- You're in charge now.

528
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,543
Don't disappoint me. (hammers thudding)

529
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:33,644
- Thank you, my queen. (muffled chatter)

530
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,113
- [Foreman] All right, back to work!

531
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:37,849
(rousing string accent)

532
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:40,618
(birds chirping)

533
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,626
- Haven't you seen one of these before?

534
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:52,730
- I, I-I-I-I-I-I just planted these yesterday!

535
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:54,632
- Well, I'm impressed.

536
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:58,603
- You don't understand, I, I just planted these yesterday!

537
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:01,739
(birds chirping)

538
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:06,144
(footsteps thudding over clattering plates)

539
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:08,613
A fresh batch of tomatoes.

540
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:11,115
- Good, it's about time!

541
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:13,551
(tomato squishing)

542
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:16,621
What is this, some kind of joke?

543
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:18,289
(tomatoes squishing)

544
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:20,725
- They were fresh and, and barely ripe just a minute ago!

545
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:25,129
- (laughs) And I'm the king of Baluria (laughs),

546
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:29,367
you festering bucket of pus!

547
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,302
(man shouting over comical boing)

548
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:35,840
(man shouting over clattering plates)

549
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:37,809
(dramatic orchestral music)

550
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:41,212
- Your Majesty, the flowers have died.

551
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:47,185
I apologize, they were fresh blooms only yesterday.

552
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:51,155
(scoffs) I don't understand. (tense, ominous orchestration)

553
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:52,457
- So, Karnissa,

554
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:57,261
it's begun. (tense orchestral swell)

555
00:34:57,295 --> 00:35:00,364
- The clock is ticking, King Francis.

556
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:05,736
Convince your neighboring lands to bow before me

557
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,706
or your kingdoms will crumble to dust

558
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:11,209
before your disbelieving eyes!

559
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:15,413
(machinery clanking over tense, dramatic orchestral music)

560
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:22,854
(machinery whirring over dramatic vocal choir)

561
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:31,696
(bell clanging over tense orchestral music)

562
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:38,369
(machinery clanking)

563
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:39,837
(bell clanging)

564
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:42,773
- The crops are dead, and my livestock is dying!

565
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:43,941
What is happening?

566
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,843
- Eh, all the crops, your majesty!

567
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:48,279
There's a food shortage rapidly developing.

568
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:50,214
- This is happening everywhere.

569
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:52,650
Our messengers are returning daily with terrifying stories

570
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:55,786
of aging from every corner of the world.

571
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,357
It seems Aeschylus' device indeed works.

572
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:03,427
- Damn that evil woman to hell!

573
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:05,796
(tense tympani)

574
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:09,767
So this is where our desire for peace has led us.

575
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,801
It's insane.

576
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:14,605
- We have some chilling results from studies

577
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,807
we've been doing, my lord.

578
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:20,478
- What do they say?

579
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,780
- Calculating the current age acceleration

580
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:26,617
that seems to be taking place and projecting ahead,

581
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:28,886
it appears that every living thing

582
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,822
is aging at a rate of roughly one year per week.

583
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,859
(crowd gasping and chattering)

584
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:38,863
If things continue at the present rate,

585
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:41,332
it seems we have less than one year to live.

586
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,768
(crowd gasping and chattering)

587
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:44,802
(Loffo groans)

588
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:47,939
(crowd chattering)

589
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,677
- With every second that passes,

590
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,646
we're losing days of precious time.

591
00:36:56,981 --> 00:37:00,952
That clock must be found somehow and destroyed.

592
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:02,720
Karnissa's madness is so profound,

593
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:05,289
we cannot hope to bargain.

594
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:06,891
Assemble the armies!

595
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:11,295
(ducks quacking over pleasant orchestral music)

596
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:16,534
- [Stephanie] (sobs) I'm only 12 years old!

597
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,337
What's happening to me?

598
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:23,975
(Stephanie sighs)

599
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:28,012
- [James] Don't cry.

600
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,348
- Oh (gasps).

601
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:34,752
(snivels) Um, I wasn't crying (gasps).

602
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:37,955
I must just be allergic to something (sighs).

603
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:41,859
(pleasant orchestral music)

604
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:48,933
You're that page boy that brought me my dinner.

605
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:51,869
- Yeah, that was me.

606
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:56,540
(pleasant orchestral music)

607
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:00,878
- You looked so ridiculous with my bird on your head.

608
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:04,982
- (laughs) Yes, uh-huh, that was very funny.

609
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:08,552
- That look on your face was, was precious.

610
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:11,389
- You've made your point.

611
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:13,891
- Oh, I'm sorry, I'm being rude.

612
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:19,930
You actually looked quite adorable.

613
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:23,668
- Really?

614
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,837
(animals chattering)

615
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:28,539
(machinery clanking)

616
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:29,440
(bell clanging)

617
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:32,743
(rousing horn fanfare)

618
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,016
- My countrymen, this is something

619
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:43,621
I thought I would never again have to do,

620
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,923
but there is one battle,

621
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:48,693
one last battle we have to fight,

622
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:53,597
and it is a battle that directly affects the life

623
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:57,001
of every single living thing in the world!

624
00:38:57,034 --> 00:39:00,738
For the first time in history, every army,

625
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:06,477
from our nearest neighbor to our furthest enemy,

626
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:09,146
sets sail with one single purpose,

627
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:12,817
to stop this evil machine,

628
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:15,986
to stop time itself!

629
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:21,058
Well, now, my countrymen,

630
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:24,061
I place all my hopes and prayers

631
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:27,031
in your capable hands as you embark

632
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:34,071
on the greatest quest the world has ever known.

633
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:36,874
Our love goes with you, godspeed!

634
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:42,880
(group cheering over rousing orchestral music)

635
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:53,090
(muffled chatter over rousing orchestral music)

636
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:55,960
- I wish I could go with you!

637
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:59,196
- I know you do, but you've gotten your wish.

638
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,966
You're a royal guard assigned to the king.

639
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:06,170
Impressive, mother and father would've been proud.

640
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:10,608
(sighs) I'll miss you, little brother.

641
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:12,710
- I'm not so little anymore!

642
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:16,580
- See what happens when you're in such a rush to grow up?

643
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:18,215
- Be careful, Alexander.

644
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,050
- Don't worry about me.

645
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,019
I'll be coming back a hero.

646
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:25,122
(muffled chatter over dramatic orchestral music)

647
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:27,124
Take care of the king. (machinery clanking)

648
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:30,928
(rousing orchestral music)

649
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:41,772
(group cheering over rousing orchestral music)

650
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:57,188
(hull creaking over rousing orchestral music)

651
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:03,594
(crowd cheering over rousing orchestral music)

652
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:07,665
(hull creaking)

653
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:10,201
- Godspeed.

654
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:16,674
(Francis sighs)

655
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:19,176
(wind rustling)

656
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:26,684
- I've aged 10 years in weeks, and yet it seems

657
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:29,220
I'll never be old enough for responsibility.

658
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:32,890
(birds chirping)

659
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:37,228
- You're assigned to the king's guard, aren't you?

660
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:38,095
- Yeah.

661
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:43,000
- What more responsibility could you want?

662
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:45,069
You protect the king, my father!

663
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:48,038
(birds chirping)

664
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:53,210
- He's a great man.

665
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:55,846
- Yes, but he's just a man.

666
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:00,050
He puts all this responsibility upon his shoulders, and

667
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:02,653
it frightens me.

668
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:08,058
Please try and help him.

669
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,029
- I will.

670
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,001
- Thank you, James.

671
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:23,173
(Stephanie sighs)

672
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,309
You know, I read fortunes.

673
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:28,212
- Oh, yeah, what's in my future?

674
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:33,284
- (sighs) Seems you're going to live a very long life.

675
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:38,789
- (chuckles) I'll just live it very quickly.

676
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:41,659
- Ooh, says here you're impatient.

677
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,863
(pleasant orchestral music)

678
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,731
- [James] Hmm.

679
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:50,167
- You'll soon be taking a long journey.

680
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:54,071
(pleasant orchestral music)

681
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:56,740
- What else?

682
00:42:56,774 --> 00:43:00,244
(pleasant orchestral music)

683
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:04,114
- That you'll fall in love.

684
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:08,319
(flowing and pleasant orchestral music)

685
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:24,735
(lips smacking)

686
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:30,040
(flowing and pleasant orchestral music)

687
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:38,215
(machinery clanking)

688
00:43:38,248 --> 00:43:39,350
(bell clanging)

689
00:43:39,383 --> 00:43:42,353
(rousing orchestral music)

690
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:43,954
(man groans)

691
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:45,956
- Identify yourself, stranger!

692
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:49,093
(Sauris gasping)

693
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:50,794
My God, it's Sauris!

694
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:55,232
- My king wishes that our nations at this time

695
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:59,136
of universal threat may drop their quarrels,

696
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:04,375
work together to forge lasting peace, your highness.

697
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:11,148
- This is indeed welcome news.

698
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:14,785
Our thanks to the Morlin leader.

699
00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:19,423
Aralon will indeed honor his request for peace,

700
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:23,827
now and for many years after this evil time has passed.

701
00:44:26,196 --> 00:44:28,832
Too long have our nations shed senseless blood.

702
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:30,968
(door creaking)

703
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:34,238
(tense orchestral swell)

704
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:38,442
(dramatic and rousing orchestral music)

705
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:48,986
- At your service, your majesty.

706
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,455
And when they realized I was going directly to the king

707
00:44:51,488 --> 00:44:55,325
to report this terrible murder, I was brutally beaten.

708
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,429
(footsteps clacking)

709
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:04,068
- You served your country well, my friend.

710
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:05,869
Do you have any idea where they've gone?

711
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:09,440
- I heard Karnissa order the ship to

712
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:10,441
fly to Gamara.

713
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:14,978
- Gamara,

714
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:17,948
of course.

715
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:23,954
They would never think of that deserted, black rock.

716
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:29,326
- I'm assuming that was her intention, sire.

717
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:32,963
- We can only pray that our soldiers find Karnissa

718
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:34,832
before she finds them.

719
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:38,402
(tense percussion swell)

720
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:42,806
(horses whinneying over rousing orchestral music)

721
00:45:56,019 --> 00:46:00,190
(hooves clopping over rousing orchestral music)

722
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:21,044
(muffled chatter over rousing orchestral music)

723
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:25,249
(dramatic and rousing orchestral music)

724
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:32,422
(hull creaking)

725
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:33,924
- One more sweep to the south

726
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:36,927
should eliminate this area as an option.

727
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,862
What do you think, Alexander?

728
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:40,898
- I think we're chasing our tails.

729
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:44,401
- Morlin ships off the port bow!

730
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:46,470
(muffled shouting)

731
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:48,505
- I thought we were supposed to be on the same team!

732
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:50,607
- [Lookout] Open your eyes, men!

733
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,643
- I estimate 20 warships.

734
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:56,146
(muffled shouting over rousing orchestral music)

735
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:58,148
- Have they seen us yet?

736
00:46:58,182 --> 00:46:59,616
- [Lookout] Have they seen us yet?

737
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,386
(tense orchestral music)

738
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:05,155
- Have they seen us yet? (mast creaking)

739
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:08,258
- If we move now, surprise may be on our side.

740
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:09,960
- This is not our mission.

741
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:13,564
I received no orders to intercept Aralon ships.

742
00:47:13,597 --> 00:47:15,899
(machinery whirring)

743
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:20,003
- My Queen, the Aralon fleet has crossed the coastline.

744
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:23,540
- Make fine bloodhounds, these Aralon soldiers.

745
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:26,376
I cannot allow them to come any closer.

746
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:28,645
(machinery clanking)

747
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:31,481
Now is the time for God and all his creatures

748
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:34,418
to feel the full force of my power.

749
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:38,455
May the elements bend and twist to my bidding!

750
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:42,659
May the heavens open and the rains come and the winds blow!

751
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:45,128
(wind howling)

752
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:49,132
- Secure the cannons and no one fires without my order!

753
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:50,601
Is that understood?

754
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:55,272
(muffled shouting over rousing orchestral music)

755
00:47:55,305 --> 00:47:57,140
- They're not changing course!

756
00:47:57,174 --> 00:48:01,345
(soldiers shouting over rousing orchestral music)

757
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:04,348
(winch clanking)

758
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:08,385
(soldiers shouting over cannons rumbling on deck)

759
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:11,088
- We really can't afford

760
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:13,490
to lose any men in a full engagement.

761
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:17,561
However, if the Morlins are after the machine,

762
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:21,131
they may use it against us.

763
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:24,234
- This will be in direct defiance of our orders.

764
00:48:24,268 --> 00:48:26,236
- I think we've been spotted, sir!

765
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:30,440
(muffled shouting over rousing orchestral music)

766
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:32,709
- We're headed straight for them!

767
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,444
(sharp rumbling)

768
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:36,513
- Captain, they're firing on us!

769
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:37,414
- They're firing!

770
00:48:37,447 --> 00:48:40,050
- Prepare the cannons to return fire!

771
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:42,185
(crewmen shouting over cannons rumbling on deck)

772
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:44,154
- Request permission to return fire.

773
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:46,623
- Permission grant, wait!

774
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:50,560
(thunder rumbling over muffled shouting)

775
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,162
That's not cannon fire.

776
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:56,133
- Hurricane, hurricane at the starboard bow!

777
00:48:56,166 --> 00:48:59,169
(thunder rumbling over tense orchestral music)

778
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:01,571
- Full right rudder, now!

779
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:03,273
(hull creaking)

780
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:06,743
- Full reverse, full reverse! (crewmen shouting)

781
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,612
- Damn you, Karnissa!

782
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:10,681
(thunder rumbling over tense orchestral music)

783
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:12,683
Secure everything!

784
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:14,584
- May the saints preserve us!

785
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:15,585
(crewman shouting)

786
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,788
(wood cracking)

787
00:49:17,821 --> 00:49:22,592
(Karnissa cackling over muffled shouting)

788
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:27,331
(wood cracking and crunching)

789
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:31,101
(crewmen shouting over howling wind)

790
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:33,437
(wood cracking and crunching)

791
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:36,139
(crewmen shouting)

792
00:49:36,173 --> 00:49:38,075
(wood cracking and crunching)

793
00:49:38,108 --> 00:49:39,710
(explosion rumbling)

794
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:43,714
(Karnissa cackling over howling wind)

795
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:47,284
(bell clanging)

796
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:49,619
- They're dead, I can feel it.

797
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:56,760
- Who is dead, Papa? (expressive orchestral music)

798
00:49:56,793 --> 00:50:01,565
- My armies, my people (sighs),

799
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:03,367
how could I have brought this wretched suffering

800
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,203
on this kingdom that I love so much?

801
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:07,070
- Hush!

802
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:13,243
Our fleet may still be victorious, you must have faith!

803
00:50:13,276 --> 00:50:15,779
- No, I'm afraid all hope is gone.

804
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:18,315
(expressive strings)

805
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,650
What a sad legacy have I left.

806
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:24,454
Born into a position of unparalleled power,

807
00:50:24,488 --> 00:50:26,656
I've done nothing with it.

808
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:29,860
I've failed my people.

809
00:50:29,893 --> 00:50:31,828
- That's not true, Papa.

810
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:35,565
You have done so many wonderful things,

811
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:38,368
please don't do this to yourself!

812
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:40,771
(Francis coughs)

813
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:41,471
(Stephanie scoffs)

814
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:45,809
(expressive orchestral music)

815
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:49,880
- (sighs) Oh, my child.

816
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:54,384
(sighs) What will you do when I'm gone?

817
00:50:54,418 --> 00:50:58,588
(birds chirping over expressive strings)

818
00:51:01,191 --> 00:51:05,262
- Papa, I found someone who will take care of me.

819
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:07,764
- Who?

820
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:09,699
- This James, one of your guards.

821
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:13,537
(expressive violin)

822
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:17,174
- Is he a good man, does he treat you well?

823
00:51:19,876 --> 00:51:22,746
- I'm in love with him, I think.

824
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:26,650
- That makes me very happy.

825
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:32,322
I think that in these dark days, new love can bloom,

826
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:35,425
and that alone gives me hope.

827
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:38,528
(expressive strings)

828
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:42,265
Be good to him, Stephanie.

829
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:45,402
(Stephanie whimpers)

830
00:51:46,703 --> 00:51:48,538
(chuckles) I would've given anything

831
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:50,774
to have seen a grandchild.

832
00:51:50,807 --> 00:51:53,877
(expressive strings)

833
00:51:56,346 --> 00:51:58,248
Love that child for me.

834
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:00,717
- I will, Papa.

835
00:52:01,852 --> 00:52:02,886
I will.

836
00:52:06,756 --> 00:52:07,724
(machinery clanking)

837
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:09,359
(bell clanging)

838
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:12,929
(men chattering over rousing orchestral music)

839
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:16,700
(machinery clanking)

840
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:20,904
(bell tolling over dramatic orchestral music)

841
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:31,414
(muffled chatter over dramatic orchestral music)

842
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:39,556
- Alexander, it's me, I'm here.

843
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:43,894
- (panting) We never stood a chance.

844
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:47,898
The storm, oh, God, that storm (gasping)!

845
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:49,599
Most of my men are still out there.

846
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:50,800
- What happened?

847
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,869
- Karnissa's magic.

848
00:52:52,903 --> 00:52:55,705
Too strong (groans).

849
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:59,676
(dramatic vocal choir)

850
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:02,445
(sword rattling)

851
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:08,852
Defend Aralon, James.

852
00:53:08,885 --> 00:53:09,986
Protect them.

853
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:13,857
- Alex,

854
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:16,393
hold on!

855
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:18,862
Hold on!

856
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:22,599
(dramatic orchestral music and vocal choir)

857
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:24,534
- It's good to be home.

858
00:53:25,735 --> 00:53:29,940
- No, (sobs) please, God, no!

859
00:53:29,973 --> 00:53:34,277
(muffled chatter over expressive orchestral music)

860
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:45,956
- [Alexander] Defend Aralon, James.

861
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:46,856
Protect them.

862
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:54,965
(muffled sobbing over dramatic and rousing orchestral music)

863
00:54:10,113 --> 00:54:13,483
(birds chirping)

864
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:17,687
(birds chirping over expressive strumming guitar)

865
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:32,702
- (sighs) I'm so sorry.

866
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:36,940
- I have to go, Stephanie.

867
00:54:36,973 --> 00:54:40,410
(expressive guitar and strings)

868
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:41,911
There's no one left!

869
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:48,652
- Why, why do you have to go, what are you gonna prove?

870
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,989
- We're too young to die!

871
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:56,693
Somebody has to stop that clock!

872
00:54:58,094 --> 00:55:01,831
I finally found something, someone

873
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:04,801
who gave me a purpose in this life.

874
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:10,707
I'm not gonna lose the only thing that I love.

875
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:14,911
(Stephanie sighs)

876
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,948
- There's someone I want you to meet.

877
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:23,353
(expressive guitar over flowing orchestral music)

878
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:41,071
Papa, you awake?

879
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:45,608
James is here.

880
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:50,447
(expressive guitar over flowing orchestral music)

881
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,416
(bed creaking)

882
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:58,054
- So you're the young man who's stolen my daughter's heart.

883
00:55:58,088 --> 00:56:02,459
- Indeed, she has stolen mine as well, your highness.

884
00:56:03,793 --> 00:56:07,530
Unworthy as I am, I seek your blessing,

885
00:56:07,564 --> 00:56:10,934
for upon my return, I intend on marrying Stephanie.

886
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:13,069
- Return from what?

887
00:56:13,103 --> 00:56:14,771
- From destroying the clock.

888
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:17,540
- What makes you think that you can accomplish

889
00:56:17,574 --> 00:56:19,142
what an army could not?

890
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:22,145
(birds chirping)

891
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:25,682
- One man rides faster than 100.

892
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:27,717
No storm can knock me from the sky, and certainly,

893
00:56:27,751 --> 00:56:32,021
no scouts would perceive a single man as a threat.

894
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:35,658
- You have a fine and noble heart, James.

895
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:39,996
(bed creaking)

896
00:56:40,029 --> 00:56:43,700
(sighs) Give me your sword.

897
00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:50,974
(sword tings)

898
00:56:52,142 --> 00:56:54,110
Kneel before me, James.

899
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:56,913
(birds chirping)

900
00:57:00,016 --> 00:57:03,686
No man may embark on a quest for the king

901
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,856
without being made a knight of the order,

902
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:10,960
so James of Aralon, it is with a mixture

903
00:57:10,994 --> 00:57:12,662
of sadness and pride

904
00:57:14,731 --> 00:57:15,999
that I dub thee

905
00:57:18,635 --> 00:57:19,469
knight.

906
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:23,773
The journey before you is as perilous

907
00:57:23,807 --> 00:57:25,909
as the pastures of Hades,

908
00:57:27,177 --> 00:57:29,813
but should you be victorious,

909
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:35,051
such is the stuff as legends are made of.

910
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:40,557
Your duties are to uphold the honor

911
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:46,095
and integrity of all righteous things,

912
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:52,001
so rise, Sir James, and peace be with you.

913
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:56,239
(pleasant and hopeful orchestral music)

914
00:57:56,272 --> 00:57:58,808
Come back to us soon, James.

915
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:02,278
Don't break my daughter's heart.

916
00:58:03,947 --> 00:58:07,717
A knight is not judged by his prowess with a sword.

917
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:11,154
Heroism comes from the inside.

918
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,192
- Yes, your majesty.

919
00:58:17,594 --> 00:58:20,230
(Francis gasping)

920
00:58:23,366 --> 00:58:25,068
- Well, Sir James,

921
00:58:27,103 --> 00:58:28,905
you do have a slight advantage

922
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:32,342
in that you will actually know Karnissa's location.

923
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:34,978
It is called Gamara, (map crinkling)

924
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:38,748
and lies beyond the desert in the dead lands.

925
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:44,120
(muffled chatter)

926
00:58:44,153 --> 00:58:48,124
(sweeping and expressive orchestral music)

927
00:59:18,254 --> 00:59:20,056
- I'll be back.

928
00:59:20,089 --> 00:59:24,260
(sweeping and expressive orchestral music)

929
00:59:27,163 --> 00:59:31,200
- I wanna remember every detail of your face.

930
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:34,237
I wanna burn it in my memory.

931
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:38,641
(Stephanie whimpering over expressive orchestral music)

932
00:59:42,845 --> 00:59:45,315
(kiss snapping)

933
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:56,793
(Stephanie gasping over expressive orchestral music)

934
00:59:58,194 --> 00:59:59,762
(muffled chatter)

935
00:59:59,796 --> 01:00:02,432
(horse sighs)

936
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:07,203
(hooves clopping over expressive orchestral music)

937
01:00:07,236 --> 01:00:08,338
James, wait!

938
01:00:12,842 --> 01:00:14,010
James!

939
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:17,880
(rousing and dramatic orchestral music)

940
01:00:59,522 --> 01:01:03,092
I will love you to the ends of time.

941
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:07,330
(rousing and dramatic orchestral music)

942
01:01:13,369 --> 01:01:14,237
(machinery clanking)

943
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:15,505
(bell clanging)

944
01:01:15,538 --> 01:01:19,776
(wind howling over expressive violin)

945
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:39,262
(Francis gasping over expressive orchestral music)

946
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:48,304
- Your mother

947
01:01:50,073 --> 01:01:51,240
is calling me.

948
01:01:58,848 --> 01:02:00,316
I can't wait to look

949
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:06,456
into her eyes again.

950
01:02:13,596 --> 01:02:17,967
(wind howling over expressive orchestral music)

951
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:31,314
(kiss snapping)

952
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:35,351
(expressive orchestral music)

953
01:02:38,354 --> 01:02:41,023
(wind rustling)

954
01:02:41,057 --> 01:02:44,427
(ominous orchestral music)

955
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:48,431
(rousing and dramatic orchestral music)

956
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:35,178
(sails fluttering)

957
01:03:37,113 --> 01:03:39,949
(hooves clopping)

958
01:03:41,284 --> 01:03:45,454
(rousing and dramatic orchestral music)

959
01:03:47,523 --> 01:03:48,524
(machinery clanking)

960
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:51,427
(bell clanging)

961
01:03:52,395 --> 01:03:55,631
(expressive vocal choir)

962
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:00,570
- You seem lost in thought, my young queen.

963
01:04:00,603 --> 01:04:02,305
Thinking of James?

964
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:07,510
- (sighs) I miss him very much.

965
01:04:08,945 --> 01:04:12,415
- If Sir James is as pure of heart as he seems to be,

966
01:04:12,448 --> 01:04:13,916
he will return.

967
01:04:15,117 --> 01:04:18,588
- Yes, and he'll have this lovely old maid to return to.

968
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:21,424
- (laughs) Hush, you silly goose!

969
01:04:21,457 --> 01:04:24,460
You will always be beautiful.

970
01:04:24,493 --> 01:04:27,263
If this clock took off weight as fast as years,

971
01:04:27,296 --> 01:04:29,565
(laughs) I'd love it (chuckles)!

972
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:32,468
- Flatterer (sighs)!

973
01:04:32,501 --> 01:04:35,972
This place has become so dreary, hasn't it?

974
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:38,007
- Yes, it is very quiet.

975
01:04:40,142 --> 01:04:43,412
Your father always liked the sounds of his people,

976
01:04:43,446 --> 01:04:45,581
their laughter, their music.

977
01:04:46,749 --> 01:04:49,552
- He had such dreams for this kingdom.

978
01:04:49,585 --> 01:04:51,120
- Well, he achieved them.

979
01:04:51,153 --> 01:04:55,491
He elevated the art of living to a new level.

980
01:04:55,524 --> 01:04:58,628
He built a, a kingdom in the sky,

981
01:04:58,661 --> 01:05:01,163
dedicated to beauty and peace.

982
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:06,369
What more could anyone ask of one's life?

983
01:05:10,006 --> 01:05:11,274
- You're right.

984
01:05:12,508 --> 01:05:15,211
You know, you're a very wise man, Loffo.

985
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:19,415
- Well, of course, I'm the cook (laughs).

986
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:23,419
- And a very good friend.

987
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:27,523
(Loffo chuckles)

988
01:05:27,556 --> 01:05:30,159
(wind howling)

989
01:05:31,527 --> 01:05:35,464
(footsteps clacking over tense and ominous vocal choir)

990
01:05:57,687 --> 01:06:00,089
(gasps) Sauris!

991
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:02,625
- You're going to die, you know?

992
01:06:02,658 --> 01:06:04,593
(Stephanie gasping)

993
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:07,430
If Karnissa destroys the world,

994
01:06:08,564 --> 01:06:12,034
there'll be nothing left to rule,

995
01:06:12,068 --> 01:06:15,404
so I will send a message offering Aralon

996
01:06:16,539 --> 01:06:18,107
as my gift to her.

997
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:21,310
- Over my cold, dead body!

998
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:26,415
Ow (gasping)! (jarring orchestral accent)

999
01:06:26,449 --> 01:06:28,684
- I would have it no other way (chuckles).

1000
01:06:28,718 --> 01:06:29,752
(Stephanie grunting over stomp crunching)

1001
01:06:29,785 --> 01:06:31,187
(punch thudding)

1002
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:32,254
(Stephanie shrieks over cracking slap)

1003
01:06:32,288 --> 01:06:33,389
(horse whinneying)

1004
01:06:33,422 --> 01:06:35,791
- Stephanie (gasping)!

1005
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:37,793
(Stephanie grunts over strike thudding)

1006
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:39,695
(wood thunking)

1007
01:06:39,729 --> 01:06:42,198
(Sauris laughs)

1008
01:06:42,231 --> 01:06:45,301
(guard groaning over thudding strikes)

1009
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:47,103
(guard groaning)

1010
01:06:47,136 --> 01:06:48,571
(Stephanie gasping)

1011
01:06:48,604 --> 01:06:51,207
- That was very entertaining, your majesty.

1012
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,709
Now, don't move a muscle! (Stephanie whimpering)

1013
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:56,846
- Stephanie (grunts)?

1014
01:06:56,879 --> 01:06:59,448
(sneezes) Oh (scoffs),

1015
01:06:59,482 --> 01:07:02,685
this is wreaking havoc on my allergies.

1016
01:07:02,718 --> 01:07:05,821
Stephanie, are you in there?

1017
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,823
(knocking on door)

1018
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:10,126
Oh, fire the housekeeper.

1019
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:12,328
(machinery clanking)

1020
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:13,562
(bell clanging)

1021
01:07:13,596 --> 01:07:17,767
(rousing and dramatic orchestral music)

1022
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:43,392
(muffled chatter)

1023
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:49,799
(muffled coughing over dramatic orchestral music)

1024
01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:56,739
(hooves clopping)

1025
01:07:56,772 --> 01:08:01,143
(rousing and dramatic orchestral music)

1026
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:08,584
- Don?

1027
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:11,854
- I'll be damned!

1028
01:08:13,722 --> 01:08:15,691
- How are you, old friend?

1029
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:18,194
- I'm surviving!

1030
01:08:20,362 --> 01:08:21,931
(both sighing)

1031
01:08:21,964 --> 01:08:24,767
What on Earth are you doing here?

1032
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,669
- (sighs) I've come to stop the clock.

1033
01:08:26,702 --> 01:08:30,873
- Now, that's a hell of an idea, why didn't I think of that?

1034
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:33,909
Where's Alexander?

1035
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:36,145
Have you heard anything?

1036
01:08:37,313 --> 01:08:38,848
- He didn't make it.

1037
01:08:38,881 --> 01:08:40,716
- Oh. (wind howling)

1038
01:08:40,749 --> 01:08:44,420
- (sighs) But I'm not gonna let his death be in vain.

1039
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:46,388
I'm gonna stop that clock, Don.

1040
01:08:46,422 --> 01:08:49,892
- You'll never make it on horseback, though.

1041
01:08:50,826 --> 01:08:52,862
- Can any of these ships fly?

1042
01:08:52,895 --> 01:08:54,630
- Mm, no, I doubt it.

1043
01:08:55,831 --> 01:08:57,766
There is the Persephone,

1044
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:02,171
eh, but she's wedged pretty tight between those two peaks.

1045
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:05,307
I bet she could fly.

1046
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:07,710
- We have to get her down.

1047
01:09:07,743 --> 01:09:11,213
- Be my guest (sighs).

1048
01:09:12,414 --> 01:09:15,951
We're so old, we can barely wipe our noses.

1049
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:17,887
James, it's impossible.

1050
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:21,824
- No, it's not impossible, nothing is impossible!

1051
01:09:21,857 --> 01:09:24,260
(Don scoffs)

1052
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:28,264
(men coughing)

1053
01:09:28,297 --> 01:09:30,499
I need some strong bodies.

1054
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:32,902
- Well, hightail it back to Aralon, then,

1055
01:09:32,935 --> 01:09:36,572
because everyone here's dead or dying.

1056
01:09:36,605 --> 01:09:40,643
- Listen to me, I didn't travel all this way to quit now!

1057
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:42,811
You're not dead yet, Don, and I need you to help me,

1058
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:45,247
so stop cracking jokes and help me!

1059
01:09:45,281 --> 01:09:46,415
(machinery clanking)

1060
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:48,918
(bell clanging)

1061
01:09:50,786 --> 01:09:51,954
- Where are you taking me?

1062
01:09:51,987 --> 01:09:53,289
- Silence!

1063
01:09:53,322 --> 01:09:55,524
- I will not be silent!

1064
01:09:55,558 --> 01:09:58,994
I deserve the right to know where you're taking me.

1065
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:01,630
- Sauris offers you this.

1066
01:10:01,664 --> 01:10:04,800
Join him and you'll be spared.

1067
01:10:04,833 --> 01:10:06,468
- Never! (metal rattling)

1068
01:10:06,502 --> 01:10:07,937
(wind howling)

1069
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:10,739
- Apparently, they forgot to finish this room.

1070
01:10:10,773 --> 01:10:12,741
(guard chuckling over tense orchestral music)

1071
01:10:12,775 --> 01:10:14,910
Now, jump! (Stephanie gasping)

1072
01:10:14,944 --> 01:10:17,947
Ooh, first steps a doozy, huh, queen?

1073
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:22,418
Dive, Queenie, dive (laughs)!

1074
01:10:22,451 --> 01:10:23,986
(pan clanging)

1075
01:10:24,019 --> 01:10:25,921
- Who wants an omelet?

1076
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:29,792
- Well, get him, Sirius (laughing)!

1077
01:10:29,825 --> 01:10:30,626
(pan clanging)

1078
01:10:30,659 --> 01:10:33,429
I wanna see you fly, Queenie, fly!

1079
01:10:33,462 --> 01:10:35,631
(pan clanging)

1080
01:10:35,664 --> 01:10:38,701
(Stephanie shrieking over echoing shout)

1081
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:41,804
- There-there, there-there, dear (chuckles).

1082
01:10:41,837 --> 01:10:44,974
- Oh, Loffo (gasps), Sauris made a deal with Karnissa

1083
01:10:45,007 --> 01:10:47,743
to have the whole kingdom enslaved.

1084
01:10:47,776 --> 01:10:48,978
- I always thought that old coot

1085
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:52,081
was a few slices short of a loaf, come on!

1086
01:10:52,114 --> 01:10:56,485
(men grunting over rousing orchestral music)

1087
01:11:09,031 --> 01:11:13,402

(bell clanging)

1090
01:11:19,975 --> 01:11:20,843
Where are we going?

1091
01:11:20,876 --> 01:11:24,413
- (gasps) I know there's a secret corridor

1092
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:25,914
that leads into the throne room.

1093
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:27,616
(Stephanie shrieks)

1094
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:31,720
- When this is all over, can I take a vacation?

1095
01:11:31,754 --> 01:11:32,921
You know, I would like to go up north

1096
01:11:32,955 --> 01:11:34,990
somewhere where it's very frosty and--

1097
01:11:35,024 --> 01:11:35,924
(Stephanie grunting)

1098
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:40,629
Oh, oh, oh, (gasps) careful!

1099
01:11:40,663 --> 01:11:43,332
(both grunting)

1100
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:46,969
- Thanks, Don.

1101
01:11:47,002 --> 01:11:50,773
- Take care, and teach that toady bitch some manners!

1102
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:54,410
(rousing orchestral music)

1103
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:10,125

(rope crunching over rousing orchestral music)

1111
01:12:42,124 --> 01:12:45,027
(horse whinneying)

1112
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:47,696
- Of course you can come, old boy!

1113
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:51,100
(rousing orchestral music)

1114
01:12:55,738 --> 01:12:57,806
- Prepare to fire.

1115
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,141
(fire crackling)

1116
01:12:59,174 --> 01:13:00,943
(Loffo gasping over howling wind)

1117
01:13:00,976 --> 01:13:02,111
- Don't make me do this!

1118
01:13:02,144 --> 01:13:03,746
- (sighs) Loffo, please!

1119
01:13:03,779 --> 01:13:05,781
Don't make this any harder than it already is!

1120
01:13:05,814 --> 01:13:09,585
- (gasps) Have I told you that I'm afraid of heights?

1121
01:13:09,618 --> 01:13:10,853
- Close your eyes!

1122
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:13,856
- (groans) Oh, my ribs!

1123
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:17,659
(gasping) You're no help at all!

1124
01:13:17,693 --> 01:13:18,527
- Ready?

1125
01:13:19,161 --> 01:13:20,763
- Does it matter?

1126
01:13:20,796 --> 01:13:24,867
(Loffo gasping over playful orchestral music)

1127
01:13:27,002 --> 01:13:28,036
Phew!

(Loffo screams)

1131
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:37,679
(gasping) I'm much too old for this!

1132
01:13:37,713 --> 01:13:39,515
- (groans) Come on!

1133
01:13:39,548 --> 01:13:42,084
(metal tinging)

1134
01:13:42,117 --> 01:13:46,922
- Prepare the ship to fly to Gamara as soon as possible!

1135
01:13:46,955 --> 01:13:48,090
- Fire!

1136
01:13:48,123 --> 01:13:49,124
(cannon fire rumbling)

1137
01:13:49,158 --> 01:13:51,193

(stones rattling)

1140
01:13:57,065 --> 01:13:59,635
She's moving, she's really moving!

1141
01:13:59,668 --> 01:14:01,036
(hull creaking)

1142
01:14:01,069 --> 01:14:03,138

(hull rattling over dramatic orchestral music)

1144

Lift up, lift up, James! (crowd shouting)

01:14:11,547 --> 01:14:15,717
(James groaning over cracking wood)

1146
01:14:16,852 --> 01:14:17,853

(crowd shouting over dramatic orchestral music)

1148
01:14:25,794 --> 01:14:27,930
Give 'em hell, James!

1149
01:14:27,963 --> 01:14:32,067
(crowd shouting over rousing orchestral music)

1150
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:36,138
- Keep the faith, Don.

1151
01:14:36,171 --> 01:14:40,042
(dramatic orchestral music)

1152
01:14:40,075 --> 01:14:44,246

(keys jingling)

1157
01:14:55,123 --> 01:14:58,093
- We have very little time.

1158
01:14:58,126 --> 01:14:59,928
Is the ship ready?

1159
01:14:59,962 --> 01:15:01,964
- Yes, my liege.

1160
01:15:01,997 --> 01:15:04,199
- That's the message to Karnissa.

1161
01:15:04,233 --> 01:15:07,302
- Why don't you just ask him nicely for it?

1162
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:10,172
(Sauris coughing)

1163
01:15:12,241 --> 01:15:15,010
(Sauris gasping)

1164
01:15:16,245 --> 01:15:20,315
- Fly white sails so they may know you come in peace.

1165
01:15:22,818 --> 01:15:25,721
- You know, I haven't had a chance to read through this yet.

1166
01:15:25,754 --> 01:15:26,588
- Stop!

1167
01:15:27,489 --> 01:15:30,826
Loffo, throw the scroll into the fire.

1168
01:15:33,962 --> 01:15:36,298
(scroll thwacking)

1169
01:15:36,331 --> 01:15:41,136
- Get a haircut! (playful orchestral music)

1170
01:15:41,169 --> 01:15:43,672
Clean up this mess, boys, watch it!

1171
01:15:43,705 --> 01:15:46,241
(Loffo groans)

1172
01:15:46,275 --> 01:15:47,976
Move it, cue ball,

1173
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:51,580
you're crowding me, go on! (playful orchestral music)

1174

(Stephanie shrieks)

1178
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:08,297
- Did you have a flair for drama, my queen?

1179
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:11,133
- It's over, Sauris, you're out of time!

1180
01:16:11,166 --> 01:16:13,802
Look in the mirror, how much time do you have left?

1181
01:16:13,835 --> 01:16:16,305
Hours, minutes, seconds perhaps?

1182
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:20,809
- Big talk for a girl with a knife at her throat!

1183
01:16:20,842 --> 01:16:22,044
Finish her!

1184
01:16:22,077 --> 01:16:26,014
- Please (gasps), we are not animals!

1185
01:16:26,048 --> 01:16:30,218
(panting) This kingdom loved you!

1186
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:35,691
There's so little time left (gasping),

1187
01:16:35,724 --> 01:16:37,960
don't waste it on hate.

1188
01:16:37,993 --> 01:16:41,797
(pants) It's so pointless!

1189
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:45,667
(expressive orchestral music)

1190
01:16:51,473 --> 01:16:53,208
- You're all gutless!

1191
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:56,044
(pedestal rattling)

1192
01:16:56,078 --> 01:16:59,281
There's still time! (ominous orchestral music)

1193
01:16:59,314 --> 01:17:03,285
I promise you wealth beyond anything you can imagine!

1194
01:17:06,254 --> 01:17:09,224
I promise you (coughs)!

1195
01:17:09,257 --> 01:17:10,192
(machinery clanking)

1196
01:17:10,225 --> 01:17:11,259

(Sauris thuds to the floor)

1199
01:17:18,367 --> 01:17:21,903
(pleasant and hopeful orchestral music)

1200
01:17:21,937 --> 01:17:25,474
- I guess he only had seconds left.

1201
01:17:25,507 --> 01:17:27,709
- Let's get out of here.

1202
01:17:30,178 --> 01:17:33,982
(ship whooshing over rousing orchestral music)

1203
01:17:34,016 --> 01:17:34,983
(horse sighs)

1204
01:17:35,017 --> 01:17:38,387

(machinery clanking)

(bell clanging)

1209
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:54,236
(Loffo gasps over tense orchestral music)

1210
01:17:54,269 --> 01:17:55,771
Loffo!

1211
01:17:55,804 --> 01:17:59,374
- I guess I'm going the way of Sauris.

1212
01:17:59,408 --> 01:18:01,410
- No, no, Loffo, Loffo!

1213
01:18:01,443 --> 01:18:04,146
Please, hold on, please, for me?

1214
01:18:04,179 --> 01:18:06,915
Hold on just a little bit more, please!

1215
01:18:06,948 --> 01:18:09,317
(Loffo gasping)

1216
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:13,422
Oh, God, no! (tense orchestral music)

1217
01:18:13,455 --> 01:18:17,826

(James grunts)

1221
01:18:40,315 --> 01:18:41,316
(machinery clanking)

1222
01:18:41,349 --> 01:18:42,117
(bell clanging)

1223
01:18:42,150 --> 01:18:46,555
(James groans over creaking wood)

1224
01:18:46,588 --> 01:18:49,958
- Your Majesty, there is a ship approaching.

1225
01:18:49,991 --> 01:18:52,461
- That's impossible, how close?

1226
01:18:52,494 --> 01:18:55,864
- Approximately three miles due east.

1227
01:18:55,897 --> 01:18:56,531
I'm sorry.

1228
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:02,938
- It appears that your trusted scouts have failed me.

1229
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:05,540
- This isn't my fault!

1230
01:19:07,209 --> 01:19:11,346
- And since they're not here to suffer, someone must pay!

1231
01:19:11,379 --> 01:19:13,281
- Please, your majesty!

1232
01:19:14,216 --> 01:19:15,083
I beg of you.

1233
01:19:17,252 --> 01:19:19,988
- (groans) It's just one stupid little ship,

1234
01:19:20,021 --> 01:19:22,557
but blow it out of the sky anyway.

1235
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:25,327

(explosions rumbling over tense orchestral music)

1245

01:19:51,219 --> 01:19:52,888
(cannon fire rumbling)

1247

(group shouting)

1256
01:20:10,338 --> 01:20:14,276
(crashing and rumbling over dramatic orchestral music)

1257
01:20:19,681 --> 01:20:22,384
- Secure the area immediately!

1258
01:20:23,952 --> 01:20:26,288
(men shouting over clanking machinery)

1259
01:20:26,321 --> 01:20:29,090
