01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:09,290
Fuck!

1723
01:12:09,490 --> 01:12:11,330
Sly, I need you
to search everybody, all right?

1724
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:13,860
We gotta find that ring.

1725
01:12:14,050 --> 01:12:15,410
Didn't you have
more guys with you?

1726
01:12:15,490 --> 01:12:17,420
I had my cousin, Gavin.

1727
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:18,820
But I ain't seen him in hours.

1728
01:12:20,110 --> 01:12:22,120
I've been wanting this all day.

1729
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:23,600
Thank you, brother. Yes, sir.

1730
01:12:24,990 --> 01:12:26,560
Damn, that's all you?

1731
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:30,310
Yes! These are my
Obama specials. Okay?

1732
01:12:30,510 --> 01:12:33,690
I voted for him... three times.

1733
01:12:34,870 --> 01:12:37,490
Yes we can. Yes we can.

1734
01:12:37,690 --> 01:12:39,920
- Everybody, hands!
- Let me see your hands.

1735
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:42,480
Everybody. Yo, hands.

1736
01:12:45,830 --> 01:12:47,930
Got it! Here it is.

1737
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:50,330
- Yo, where'd you get this ring at?
- Man, I won it.

1738
01:12:50,530 --> 01:12:52,110
You win this ring, man?
Prove it!

1739
01:12:52,310 --> 01:12:54,550
Bro, I'm Tristan Thompson.

1740
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:58,070
Oh. It is Tristan Thompson!
Yo, but your hand big!

1741
01:12:58,270 --> 01:13:01,380
God damn. I thought you had
elephantitis or some shit, man.

1742
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:03,910
- Sly, you find it?
- Still working on it.

1743
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:05,730
We never gonna find
LeBron's ring, bro.

1744
01:13:05,930 --> 01:13:07,170
Kev, we gotta replace it.

1745
01:13:07,370 --> 01:13:08,786
We gotta try
one of them black markets.

1746
01:13:08,810 --> 01:13:11,570
- Wait, y'all lost LeBron's...?
- [Shushes]

1747
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:12,960
No, we didn't lose it.

1748
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:14,870
It was stolen.

1749
01:13:15,070 --> 01:13:17,050
- Are you serious?
- Somebody stole it.

1750
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:18,620
- I can get another ring.
- Oh!

1751
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:20,360
Damn, cudi.
Where'd you come from?

1752
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:22,620
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.
What'd you just say?

1753
01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:24,270
I can get y'all another ring.

1754
01:13:24,470 --> 01:13:26,620
Like another one-of-a-kind
NBA championship ring?

1755
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:29,100
Yeah. Just let me know the year.

1756
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:30,630
- How?
- What?

1757
01:13:30,830 --> 01:13:33,010
Simple. The illuminati.

1758
01:13:34,450 --> 01:13:35,980
The illuminati. Man!

1759
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:38,590
Man, cudi, we ain't got time
for this bullshit.

1760
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:41,630
All right. I was just trying
to help you little niggas.

1761
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:44,550
Hold on, wait. Cudi.

1762
01:13:44,750 --> 01:13:45,750
You serious?

1763
01:13:45,890 --> 01:13:47,300
Look at me.

1764
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:49,520
I don't joke
about the illuminati.

1765
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:51,870
Come... come on, kev.

1766
01:13:52,070 --> 01:13:53,520
You not buying this, are you?

1767
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:54,916
I mean, look at this man, bro.

1768
01:13:54,940 --> 01:13:56,390
He is a crazy person.

1769
01:13:56,590 --> 01:13:59,530
Look. He eating
an apple in a party.

1770
01:13:59,730 --> 01:14:01,440
Who eats an apple
in a party, kev?

1771
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:03,796
- That's the sign of a madman.
- [Kevin] Let's just hear him out.

1772
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:05,900
Even if we get a replica,
until we find the real one.

1773
01:14:06,790 --> 01:14:07,880
All right, kev.

1774
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:09,540
All right. Go ahead.

1775
01:14:09,740 --> 01:14:13,150
All right, so there...
There's rings in this house?

1776
01:14:13,350 --> 01:14:15,510
The illuminati gets a copy
of every championship trophy

1777
01:14:15,650 --> 01:14:18,680
and rings dating back to the
first baseball and lacrosse games.

1778
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,160
Lacrosse...

1779
01:14:20,350 --> 01:14:21,450
It's a prestige thing.

1780
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:23,760
There's a party tonight.

1781
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:27,290
I'm just gonna skip it.

1782
01:14:27,490 --> 01:14:33,040
Okay... let's say, for the sake of this
story, I believe you, and how do we...

1783
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:34,516
How would we
get one of the rings?

1784
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:36,390
- How?
- It's the illuminati.

1785
01:14:36,590 --> 01:14:38,040
Nobody gives a fuck
about that shit.

1786
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:40,440
We all got money.

1787
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:43,820
I've seen better cock rings
than NBA championship rings.

1788
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,180
Okay, that's... okay.

1789
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:47,750
Look, I'll go.

1790
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:48,970
And you watch the party.

1791
01:14:49,170 --> 01:14:50,880
What? You shitting me, bro?

1792
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:52,560
The illuminati?
Man, I gotta see this.

1793
01:14:52,650 --> 01:14:54,406
If he talkin' about something,
I gotta come...

1794
01:14:54,430 --> 01:14:56,150
Somebody got to keep
things under control!

1795
01:14:56,350 --> 01:14:57,760
I'll do it.

1796
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:01,500
I will watch the party
while you guys... do this.

1797
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:03,460
I can't ask you
to get involved, though.

1798
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:04,420
You didn't ask me.

1799
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:06,200
I'm volunteering.

1800
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,500
Besides, I would've been
left by now.

1801
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:16,430
[Damon chuckles]

1802
01:15:16,630 --> 01:15:18,430
Yeah, that's my dawg.

1803
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:21,480
Hey, I'm sorry to mess a good
moment up, but we got shit to do.

1804
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:23,510
Go, go. Yeah, go. Go, go, go.

1805
01:15:26,390 --> 01:15:27,960
[Cudi] <i>Okay, so the plan</i>
<i>is simple.</i>

1806
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:29,740
<i>I'll bring you two
in as my guests.</i>

1807
01:15:31,650 --> 01:15:33,750
<i>One wrong move and we're dead.</i>

1808
01:15:33,950 --> 01:15:35,970
<i>Just be cool, and don't say
more than you have to.</i>

1809
01:15:36,170 --> 01:15:37,530
These are my two manservants.

1810
01:15:39,530 --> 01:15:41,320
Of course, Scott.

1811
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,520
[Cudi] <i>Damon, you're gonna head</i>
<i>to the trophy room.</i>

1812
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:45,550
<i>Get in, get out.</i>

1813
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:47,810
<i>While you do that, we'll
mingle amongst the crowd.</i>

1814
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:50,280
[Orchestral music playing]

1815
01:15:56,590 --> 01:15:59,250
Okay. Don't embarrass me.

1816
01:15:59,450 --> 01:16:00,450
Just be cool.

1817
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:09,300
[Inaudible conversation]

1818
01:16:14,610 --> 01:16:15,700
Mr. Cuban?

1819
01:16:17,610 --> 01:16:21,490
Look, I know you get this
all the time, but I got this idea.

1820
01:16:21,690 --> 01:16:23,280
I'll buy it.

1821
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:25,930
But I mean, you haven't even
heard the rest of the idea.

1822
01:16:26,130 --> 01:16:27,150
We'll be in touch.

1823
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:29,810
Wait, I got my... a cell phone.

1824
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:31,020
We'll be in touch.

1825
01:16:31,930 --> 01:16:33,020
Who's "we"?

1826
01:16:36,630 --> 01:16:39,250
A little wine. Okay. Thank you.

1827
01:16:39,450 --> 01:16:40,560
Thank you. All right.

1828
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:42,210
This is the first ritual.

1829
01:16:42,410 --> 01:16:44,520
Take a sip to show solidarity.

1830
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:47,480
What kind of wine is this?
It look a little different.

1831
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:49,870
It's not wine. It's blood.

1832
01:16:50,070 --> 01:16:52,220
- What?
- Drink it, or you'll blow our cover.

1833
01:16:52,420 --> 01:16:53,570
Oh, hell no.

1834
01:16:53,770 --> 01:16:55,880
Drink that shit, nigga,
right now.

1835
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:57,230
Come on.

This smell funny.

1838
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:03,750
Dignified and esteemed
ladies and gentlemen.

1839
01:17:03,950 --> 01:17:07,580
Gather round and honor
our beloved guest,

1840
01:17:07,780 --> 01:17:12,200
Ms. Dolly Parton, who will be
performing a psychedelic rap.

Oh, yeah. Okay.

1844

Before you leave tonight,
do not forget to choose

1845
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:59,930
which days it will rain
next year.

1846

Furthermore,

1847
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:03,686

- Right, niggas.

1848
01:18:03,710 --> 01:18:05,290
- Has low numbers.
- Let's go.

1849
01:18:05,490 --> 01:18:08,640
[Host] So, please donate
on the way out or find a victim.

1850
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:09,990
Thank you very much.

1851
01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:11,260
Enjoy the night.

I posted two black squares
on my Instagram, by the way.

2235
01:35:44,810 --> 01:35:46,130
Just to let you know
how blm I am.

2236
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:47,620
One for me, one for Marley.

2237
01:35:47,820 --> 01:35:49,660
Because we are... we're down.

2238
01:35:49,860 --> 01:35:51,790
I was gonna go to the protest.

2239
01:35:51,990 --> 01:35:54,970
- But...?
- I didn't go.

2240
01:35:55,170 --> 01:35:58,930
I came up with this fire-ass
movie idea, okay?

2241
01:35:59,130 --> 01:36:01,590
It's <i>five heartbeats</i>
meets <i>demolition man.</i>

2242
01:36:01,790 --> 01:36:03,200
Same director.

2243
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:06,070
It's <i>the five heartbeats</i>
meets <i>Jurassic park.</i>

2244
01:36:06,270 --> 01:36:07,940
It's <i>roots</i> backwards.

2245
01:36:08,140 --> 01:36:09,810
So, instead of <i>roots,</i>
it's called <i>trees.</i>

2246
01:36:10,010 --> 01:36:12,600
My hosting shit really
starting to take off, too.

2247
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,080
I got all my famous...

2248

[Chuckles]

2250
01:36:18,020 --> 01:36:19,540
Yeah, my hosting shit
gonna go up, too.

2251
01:36:19,590 --> 01:36:20,650
I got all my...

2252
01:36:20,850 --> 01:36:22,560
[Coughs]

2253
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:25,090
Sorry, the water keep going
in my nose. One more time.

2254
01:36:25,290 --> 01:36:27,740
<i>You would've been a phenomenal
baseball player, by the way.</i>

2255
01:36:27,940 --> 01:36:30,050
<i>That headband makes you
look 20 years younger.</i>

2256
01:36:30,250 --> 01:36:32,310
<i>Someday, you'll be
the governor of Ohio.</i>

2257
01:36:32,510 --> 01:36:34,840
<i>How many teams you think
we can win championships with?</i>

2258
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:37,970
<i>Drake finally asked
for that feature, didn't he?</i>

2259
01:36:38,170 --> 01:36:40,410
<i>It's taco Tuesday!</i>

2260
01:36:40,610 --> 01:36:42,010
<i>You handsome devil, you.</i>

2261
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:44,880
I don't?

2262
01:36:45,230 --> 01:36:46,230
I don't?

2263
01:36:46,490 --> 01:36:47,936
You got your balls
on camera for no reason.

2264
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:50,030
Balls on camera. Shit.

2265
01:36:50,230 --> 01:36:51,850
I'm gonna cram
this straw up your butt

2266
01:36:52,050 --> 01:36:54,900
and slurp your brains
through your asshole!

2267
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:58,080
I'm gonna braid your hair then I'm
gonna scalp you, put it on my head

2268
01:36:58,280 --> 01:37:00,780
and I'm gonna play shemar Moore
in that Tyler Perry movie!

2269
01:37:00,980 --> 01:37:03,220
I'm gonna grab your earlobes,
flip 'em inside your scalp,

2270
01:37:03,410 --> 01:37:06,000
then put my hand up your ass,
grab your earlobes,

2271
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:08,390
pull it out your ass
till you're inside out, nigga.

2272
01:37:08,590 --> 01:37:10,180
<i>Looney tunes!</i>

2273
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:12,660
[Laughing]

2274
01:37:12,860 --> 01:37:15,360
Damn. Get your marasupal-ass
away from me, man.

2275
01:37:15,550 --> 01:37:17,220
Marasup...
What is it, "marasupial?"

2276
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:19,790
Yeah. Get your marasup...

2277
01:37:19,990 --> 01:37:22,280
Wait. I can't even pronounce
that word. Say it again?

2278
01:37:22,470 --> 01:37:24,580
- [Man] Marsupial.

2279
01:37:24,780 --> 01:37:25,930

2280
01:37:26,130 --> 01:37:29,330
- [Man] Marsupial.
- All right, marsupial.

2281
01:37:29,530 --> 01:37:33,060

Marsupial motherfucker, man?

[Laughing]

2284
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:43,730
Your letter was just
so touching and poetic.

2285
01:37:43,930 --> 01:37:45,720
I had to meet
the person who wrote it.

2286
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:50,000
Cut, I'm blushin'
too much. Shit.

2287
