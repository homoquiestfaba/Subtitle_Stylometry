00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:35,780
I'll take your cut.

176
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:37,816
Shut the fuck up!
Do your job!

177
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:40,519
Neck: Hang in there.
Just a little hickey, baby.

178
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:41,721
Monster: Keep the
money coming!

179
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:45,757
Come on, breacher.
Come on, come on, come on.

180
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,626
Monster: One Mike!
Tripod: Fuck, open your eyes!

181
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:49,628
Sugar: How's he doing?
Neck: He's cleaned up.

182
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,264
We gotta move him, boss!
Get him out of here now.
Get him up.

183
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:53,899
A little help, grinder!

184
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:54,900
Floyd: <i> Breacher?</i>
<i>Breacher, give me status.</i>

185
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:56,301
Breacher: Stand by.

186
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:00,105
I have men coming out.
Call up medical.

187
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:01,740
Floyd: <i> Are you</i>
<i>in the money room?</i>

188
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:03,174
Let's go!

189
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:04,943
Monster: Come on, come on.
Get some more, get some more.

190
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:06,244
Breacher: Lizzy,
how much money do we got?

191
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:07,879
About $10 million.

192
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,715
That's enough.
Go and help monster.
On it!

193
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,817
Breacher: Okay, tripod.
Moving.
Floyd: <i> John.</i>

194
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:14,180
Monster: Come on,
come on, come on.

195
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:15,887
(Coughing)

196
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,222
Moving it in.

197
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:18,590
Last spark.

198
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,661
Monster: It's in. It's in.
Lizzy: Go, go, go! Move!

199
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:24,696
Floyd: <i> God damn it, John!</i>
<i>Talk to me.</i>

200
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:27,132
We're through.
All right, stack up.

201
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,568
Breacher: Team, move.

202
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,131
Monster, stay left.
Heads on the swivel.

203
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:34,272
Coming out.

204
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:02,734
Lizzy: All right,
who dropped ass?

205
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:03,935
(Lizzy laughing)
Grinder: Holy shit!

206
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,103
(Men coughing)

207
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,271
Fuck!

208
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:09,207
Sugar: Stop splashing!

209
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:10,375
Tripod: Here we go.

210
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,278
Lizzy: Come on, boys.

211
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,679
Grinder: This better
be worth it!

212
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:16,121
Tripod: Fucking nasty.
(Men coughing)

213
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,188
Fuck.

214
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,056
Shit.
Grinder: What?

215
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:27,258
Lizzy: Where's the
fucking money?

216
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,960
Neck: Are you fucking
kidding me right now?

217
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,763
Sugar: What'd she say?
Tripod: Check in the water.

218
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:34,165
Sugar: What the fuck you mean,
check the water?

219
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:35,367
Tripod: Right behind you.

220
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:37,235
Sugar: What happened
with the money?

221
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:39,404
Neck: What do you mean
there's no fucking money?

222
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:41,740
Lizzy: Look at the rope.

223
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:45,276
Tripod: Just check down there.
Check down here.

224
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:47,278
Grinder: Oh, fucking shit.

225
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,847
Neck: Who the fuck else
knew about this shit?

226
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:52,283
Grinder: It's not in
the fucking water, man!
It's not in the fucking water!

227
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:53,752
Monster: No fucking way!

228
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:57,656
Sugar: Why don't you all just
shut the fuck up and let's go?

229
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:01,760
Hold up, you guys.
Hold up.

230
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,262
What the fuck is that?

231
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:07,666
Grinder: We just wasted
our whole fucking career

232
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:09,100
for this shit and
there's nothing here?

233
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:10,301
Sugar: This ain't good.
Let's walk.

234
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:11,836
Tripod: Check the water.

235
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:14,005
We sold ourselves out for this.

236
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:28,787
Lou: <i> We got a little problem.</i>

237
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:32,023
$10 million is missing.

238
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,426
Stan: Now listen.
You all did a
fine job in there.

239
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:38,430
We're not arguing that
you've got a good
record with the DEA.

240
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:40,398
None of that matters right now,

241
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,069
'cause all we need to do
is find out where
that $10 million is.

242
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:45,837
And that's why you're here.

243
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,939
It was a big, giant
fucking stack of money.

244
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:50,702
How do you know,
exactly down to the dollar,
how much was in that room?

245
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,811
Lou: Well, the FBI was

246
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:54,913
carrying on
a parallel investigation.

247
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:56,781
Did you ever see
the $200 million?

248
00:11:56,783 --> 00:12:00,018
Did you guys hear me
say I want my lawyer?

249
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,188
Lou: You know what
would clear your ass?
If you'd take a polygraph.

250
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,724
No poly.
No poly?

251
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:08,426
That's weak.
That's sad.

252
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:09,794
Your ass is going to prison.

253
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,932
When money is
supposed to be there
and it goes away,

254
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:15,467
and it looks like to us,
it was a setup.

255
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:17,969
It may not be,
and we're going
to find out.

256
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:20,105
And I know you had
a friend who died.

257
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:22,440
And that's awful,
and it's going
to be more awful

258
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:23,908
if it was because of money.

259
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,377
My friend did not die
for fucking $10 million.

260
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:29,114
We lost a man,
we lost a brother.

261
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:30,556
And you don't give
a shit about that.

262
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,786
Lou: It was
wharton's idea,
wasn't it?

263
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:37,422
You were just
following the lead
of a respected supervisor.

264
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,290
I mean, John is like your daddy.

265
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,092
You were doing
what you had to do.

266
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,928
Fuck you.
You don't know my daddy.

267
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,965
This agency saved your ass.
You were going nowhere.

268
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:49,067
You were a question
mark coming in here.

269
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:52,103
And you have been better
than any of us ever dreamed.

270
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,938
And you've always outperformed.

271
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,074
We're trying to
save that career.

272
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:58,176
Stan: This is
your family, Joe.
This is your family.

273
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:04,015
See, I'm not a thief.

274
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:07,185
If that cartel finds out that
you took $10 million,

275
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:11,823
they're going to
slit your throat
from ear to ear.

276
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,529
(Alarm clock ringing)

277
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,108
I gotta pee, man.

278
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:06,411
Say what?
I gotta piss.

279
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:08,046
Then go pee.

280
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:11,282
Man, he got cameras all over.
There's no way I can go.

281
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,952
Oh, dude, really?

282
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:16,187
Piss, man. What the hell?
What you think?

283
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:19,424
Where your dick
been sticking in, man.
I ain't putting it in there.

284
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:21,559
Yeah, the problem is,
your shit probably
fit in there.

285
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:24,329
My shit don't fit in there.
I need a thermos or some shit.
Look at this.

286
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:26,231
Agent 1: You threw a bottle
of piss in my lap.

287
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:28,233
Agent 2: Man, it's got
a cap on it.

288
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:29,601
Morning, breach.
Morning.

289
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:31,936
Hey, good morning.

290
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:34,105
Oh, man, thanks, breach!

291
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:35,273
Breakfast of champions, huh?

292
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:38,109
Here's your DVD, man.
Appreciate it.

293
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:40,879
And don't piss in
my bushes anymore, okay?

294
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:43,581
I have a surveillance camera.
I see it all.

295
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,250
No, that was him.
I've got a bottle.

296
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:52,123
I ain't sticking my dick
nowhere your dick
has been, damn that.

297
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,591
You didn't say
that about Rebecca.

298
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:55,426
When you fuck Rebecca?

299
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:57,128
I fuck them all.
Bro.

300
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,364
Just follow that truck.
I'm gonna deal with you.

301
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:21,986
Agent 1: I don't know if
he did it. I just know I hear
stuff, that's all I'm saying.

302
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:23,688
They're looking for something.

303
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,157
Or else we wouldn't
be following him
around like this.

304
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,292
Yeah.

305
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,538
(Breathing heavily)

306
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,014
(Grunts)

307
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,650
(Breathing heavily)

308
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,602
Why don't you just
pull the pin on this?

309
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:47,472
You're never going
to be able to spend
that blood money anyway.

310
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:48,573
Do it for your team.

311
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,275
Do it for your country.

312
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:54,245
Do it for yourself.

313
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:56,748
Retire. End it.
End the pain.

314
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,750
(Classical music
playing on headphones)

315
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:01,386
Fuck you, breacher.

316
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:11,062
I hate it as much
as you do, sir.

317
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,537
(Toilet flushes)

318
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:25,076
Tactical God.

319
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:27,111
Why don't you wash
your fucking hands?

320
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:32,116
That's a new suit?

321
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:36,054
Why do you rock
that off-the-rack,
cheap-ass jcpenney shit

322
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:38,089
when you can afford Armani?

323
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:39,757
In fact, why aren't you
on a yacht in the Caymans?

324
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,526
I know what you're trying to do.

325
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:44,128
The jabs, the jokes.

326
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:47,665
But tell them
I'm not going to bite.

327
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:50,301
What'd you tell
smoke Jennings' wife?

328
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:52,637
That he died
for a good cause,
making you rich?

329
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:57,241
Tell them you let me disarm you.

330
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:00,678
Give me the fucking gun.

331
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:03,381
(Flushes)

332
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:27,738
(Knock at door) Come in.

333
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,409
Have a seat, John.

334
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,286
It's over.

335
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,256
I'll go and clean out my desk.

336
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:46,691
I'm not firing you.

337
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:48,759
The investigation is over.

338
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:50,328
No one's been exonerated.

339
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,131
DC just lost their appetite.

340
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,368
Who do you know
in Washington, John?

341
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,138
Got a picture of a senator
fucking a goat, maybe?

342
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,205
(Scoffs)

343
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:07,145
The only thing anyone
in law enforcement has
is their credibility.

344
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:11,149
It's like virginity.
Once it's gone,
it's gone forever.

345
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,851
When did you lose yours?

346
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,553
(Chuckles)

347
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,261
What if I gave you
your team back?

348
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,664
Don't fuck with me.

349
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,167
No one wants you, John.

350
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:30,902
I've got nowhere
else to stick you.

351
00:19:30,904 --> 00:19:33,671
Mind showing some
leadership this time?

352
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:35,306
(Drawer opens)

353
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:37,708
Gun.

354
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,843
Badge.

355
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,579
Creds.

356
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:44,549
There you go.
You're back in the game.

357
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,839
They don't
fucking let us train.
They don't let us shoot.

358
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:10,908
I mean, I can't even
carry a fucking
gun in here, dude.

359
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,777
We're sitting on
our asses, rotting.

360
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:14,579
It's punishment, bro.

361
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:16,480
Don't let it get in your head.

362
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:18,316
Just deal with it. I am.

363
00:20:18,318 --> 00:20:19,817
Who's winning?
Get down.

364
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:22,720
Get the fuck out of the way!

365
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,722
Sugar: In the middle of
my goddamn game!
Monster: Fuck me!

366
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,657
Country-ass motherfucker!

367
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:29,327
Why you acting all
Jethro on that shit?
You gonna play?

368
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:31,562
Pyro: We're reduced
to a fucking rubber
gun squad, bro,

369
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,397
I feel like a fucking parolee.

370
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,666
Why is he tattooing a dick
on your back, pyro?

371
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:37,935
You know what, bro,
this is a fallen soldier.
Fuck you, man.

372
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:38,936
Will you fucking dial it down?

373
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:40,571
I just lost a buddy down range!

374
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,840
Neck: Easy, easy,
killer. Hell!

375
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:44,408
(Laughing)

376
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,244
(Whispers) It does kind
of look like a dick.

377
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:47,645
(All laugh)

378
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:49,513
The expert has spoken.

379
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,582
Bro, if I turn around

380
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,784
and see a fucking dick
in the mirror, you're dead.

381
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:55,553
It doesn't look like a dick.

382
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:56,954
Lizzy: Get off my ass, man!

383
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:58,723
Monster: You might wanna
listen to this.

384
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:00,591
(Gunfire on television)

385
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:04,495
Grinder: It's a fucking
piece of shit.
Lizzy: Fuck you.

386
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:07,565
'Cause all
the company she keeps
is rubbing off on her.

387
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:09,433
All the fucking
piece-of-shit-ness...

388
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,602
Man, you need
a Xanax or something.
(Laughs)

389
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,938
Sugar: Why don't you
go home and fuck
your mama again?

390
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,940
(Sugar and monster laugh)

391
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,674
Come on, man.

392
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:19,477
You were slightly
amusing in the field.
Here, you just suck.

393
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:21,779
I will out-fight,
out-fuck

394
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,881
and out-work you
on my worst day.

395
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:25,016
Pyro: See, I don't
wanna fuck you, lizzy.

396
00:21:25,018 --> 00:21:27,351
Crack whores are not my thing.

397
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:29,620
Hey! That's my wife, yeah?

398
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:32,990
Bro, you bought a fucking cow
when the milk was free.

399
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:36,360
Let's do it, pussy.
Come on, let's go bareback.

400
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:38,462
Wear a mouthpiece
and head guard
if you want.

401
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,865
I'll still fucking
dismantle you!

402
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:43,801
Okay, now I want to fuck her.

403
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,037
(All laughing)

404
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:49,407
Out cold, bitch!

405
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,643
Sugar: She got you.
Grinder: Yo!

406
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,045
(All stop talking)

407
00:21:54,047 --> 00:21:56,013
What the fuck is going on here?

408
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,654
This place looks like
a fucking crack house!

409
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:06,791
You shouldn't be here.
What are you doing here?

410
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:09,060
The investigation is over.

411
00:22:09,062 --> 00:22:11,529
We're back in business!
Neck: No shit?

412
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:13,364
Monster: Yes!
Whoo!

413
00:22:13,366 --> 00:22:14,732
Breacher: Here are
your credentials.
Fucking finally!

414
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:16,634
Lizzy: Whoo! Gimme!
(Monster laughs)

415
00:22:16,636 --> 00:22:18,636
Sugar: How'd you
manage this, boss?
Neck: Ain't that pretty?

416
00:22:18,638 --> 00:22:22,106
Sugar: I told you!
I told you motherfuckers!

417
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:23,741
And you, put a shirt on.
Neck: Here we go.

418
00:22:23,743 --> 00:22:25,543
You're just jealous.

419
00:22:25,545 --> 00:22:26,811
Neck: Good to
have you back, boss.

420
00:22:26,813 --> 00:22:28,079
Is that a dick?

421
00:22:28,081 --> 00:22:30,414
(All laugh) Dude!

422
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:32,617
Lizzy: It's a self-portrait!
Where's the fucking mirror?

423
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,352
Grinder: It's not done.

424
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:37,388
Monster: Let's go!

425
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,458
Morning, boss.

426
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:45,696
Morning!
Boss!

427
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:48,666
Monster: Morning, daddy.

428
00:22:48,668 --> 00:22:49,734
Good to be back.

429
00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:51,702
What took you so fucking long?

430
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:53,537
Neck: I'm embarrassed
you don't have decent shit.

431
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:54,739
Sugar: Who's got coffee?

432
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:56,140
Neck: Knock the dust off!

433
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:07,818
Are you fucking kidding me?

434
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,521
You promised you'd
use the down time
to work on yourself.

435
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:13,090
I'm fine.

436
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,061
(Sighs)

437
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:18,596
Give me the weapon.

438
00:23:18,598 --> 00:23:19,797
No.

439
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:20,865
I can train...
Lizzy.

440
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:23,000
Breacher.
I'm training.

441
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,772
Why don't you go play daddy
somewhere else, huh?

442
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,546
Come on.

443
00:23:35,548 --> 00:23:36,881
Neck: Slow the fuck down!

444
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:38,582
Monster: Shut the fuck up!

445
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:41,051
Grinder: Hurry the fuck up!
Lizzy: You're moving too fast.

446
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:42,620
Pyro: Sweetheart, shut up!
Neck: So slow.

447
00:23:42,622 --> 00:23:44,488
Neck: You need to skinny up,
motherfucker.

448
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:45,856
Monster:
Get that chicken wing
out of the way.

449
00:23:45,858 --> 00:23:47,124
Fucking get in your own Lane.

450
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:49,560
Sugar: Y'all seriously
taking giant-ass steps.

451
00:23:49,562 --> 00:23:51,862
Give me room.
Give me room!

452
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:53,497
Little room.
Little room!

453
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:55,099
Contact right!

454
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:56,167
(Gunfire)

455
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:57,935
Sugar: Hi! We're home!

456
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:00,504
Thank you!

457
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:02,907
Slowest fucking pie
I've ever seen in my life.

458
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:04,108
Whenever you're ready!

459
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,776
Neck: Come on,
open the door, let's go!

460
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:07,778
Make a decision!

461
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,548
Monster: All fucking day.
Let me pie this fucking door.

462
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,630
If there's pussy in there,
you'd already be in there.

463
00:24:12,852 --> 00:24:15,052
Monster:
It won't kick itself.
Punch it!

464
00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:16,654
Grinder: Breaching
the fucking door!

465
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:20,658
Monster: What the fuck
are you doing?

466
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:24,161
First in the room?
That's the way to
wait for the team there.

467
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:25,996
Very nice. Very nice.
That's not how
you fucking do it.

468
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:28,032
You going to get in
my fucking way every time?

469
00:24:28,034 --> 00:24:30,501
All right, secure from exercise!

470
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:33,637
This one is down.

471
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:34,639
Yeah, I got him.

472
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:40,911
What about him?
Fuck!

473
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:42,880
Grinder: And who is that?
Somebody's got to dig
that fucking corner.

474
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:44,582
Monster: No shit!

475
00:24:44,584 --> 00:24:45,916
Grinder: Yeah,
second guy in the room.
Pyro: It was you!

476
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:47,184
I was number three!
You got this guy.

477
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:48,652
That's your
fucking corner!
Breacher: Be quiet.

478
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:49,553
He's dead!
Grinder: I was
third one through!

479
00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:52,256
You should have
dug the corner.
Breacher: Shut up!

480
00:24:52,258 --> 00:24:54,758
Shut up. Grinder.

481
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,494
You have to take that corner.

482
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:57,828
You breached.

483
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,197
You immediately turn
and you go for it.

484
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:03,033
That's your responsibility,
and you cover that corner.

485
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:04,835
There's no argument here,
so let's run it again.

486
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,170
Fucking asshole.
Lizzy: Told you.

487
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:07,538
Breacher: Come on, guys.

488
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,608
(Overlapping conversations)

489
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:12,610
Pyro: Fuck it!
Why don't I run
it by myself?

490
00:25:12,612 --> 00:25:14,044
I'll show you
fuckers how to do it!

491
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:15,513
Monster: Oh, fuck off!

492
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:23,654
So what happened?
You used to be
good at this.

493
00:25:23,656 --> 00:25:27,525
Yeah, well,
six months of finger pointing
and recrimination happened.

494
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:29,093
You weren't around.
You didn't have our backs.

495
00:25:29,095 --> 00:25:31,061
Well, not by choice.

496
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:33,063
That's your fucking excuse?

497
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:35,032
When did you ever
listen to the rules?

498
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:42,873
We're not a team anymore.

499
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,876
Just a gang.

500
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:52,750
And there is no trust.
There is no trust.

501
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,558
We're going to
get it back. I know.

502
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,627
We're still a family.

503
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,664
Yeah, I wish
I could believe you.

504
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,074
Breacher:
So now we don't
trust each other?

505
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:19,209
In what we do,
there is only trust.

506
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,645
I trust you!

507
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,616
Each and every one of you.

508
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:30,888
With my life.

509
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:34,258
And I'll prove it to you.
Kick the door.

510
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:38,696
Kill the bad guys.
Don't kill me.

511
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:45,769
What the fuck
did you say to him?

512
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:55,846
(Grunts)

513
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:06,223
Target!

514
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:24,808
How did we do, boss?

515
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:28,112
Good. Good job.

516
00:27:28,114 --> 00:27:29,213
I guess we don't suck.

517
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:31,649
(Sighs)

518
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:33,250
It's time to do the lord's work.

519
00:27:33,252 --> 00:27:34,318
(All cheering)

520
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,287

521
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:39,356
(Indistinct conversations)

522
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:46,130
Shots! Beers! Come on!

523
00:27:46,132 --> 00:27:47,398
All right,
who's gonna get this round?

524
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,400
(All shouting)

525
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:51,969
I'll get the fucking round!

526
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,805
Why they call you pyro, honey?

527
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:57,174
'Cause I hooked a flashbang
in a meth lab,

528
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:59,143
burned down
the whole fucking
apartment building.

529
00:27:59,145 --> 00:28:00,911
(All laughing)

530
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:02,413
Neck: That's why
we don't let him have
the bangs no more.

531
00:28:02,415 --> 00:28:04,448
You about burned my
ass up, you bastard.

532
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:07,017
We call him pyro
'cause his ass burns.

533
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,886
(All laugh)

534
00:28:08,888 --> 00:28:10,187
(Laughs)

535
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:13,123
Yeah, whatever, asshole.

536
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:14,324
Neck: Get of here.
Get out of here.

537
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:16,427
I would hit that.
Fuck yeah!

538
00:28:16,429 --> 00:28:18,796
To lizzy,
my favorite evil bitch.

539
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:20,831
(Laughs) Evil bitch!

540
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,435
Let's drink to smoke Jennings.

541
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:28,205
That motherfucker
died for our sins.

542
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:29,306
Fuck yeah.

543
00:28:29,308 --> 00:28:30,441
Smoke Jennings!
Smoke!

544
00:28:30,443 --> 00:28:31,875
Smoke!
Smoke!

545
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:33,343
Yeah!
Smoke!

546
00:28:33,345 --> 00:28:35,045
Sugar: This is one
for the homie that
can't be here.

547
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:36,113
Smoke Jennings.

548
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,316
(Sensual R&B music playing)

549
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:50,360
You know, we missed you.

550
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,865
You're the heart and soul of us.

551
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,234
Don't ever forget that.

552
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,871
They almost won.

553
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,341
It's fucking bullshit
and you know it.

554
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,411
We're here, aren't we?

555
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:11,915
We held out

556
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,784
as a team.

557
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:21,792
It's just that,
that thing that we did

558
00:29:21,794 --> 00:29:22,960
was for nothing.

559
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:30,768
Let it go.

560
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,302
You hear me?

561
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:34,905
Let it go.

562
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,807
Okay.

563
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,915
You know what?
I can do this shit
better than all y'all.

564
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:46,350
(All cheering)

565

Bouncer:
Get the fuck
off the stage!

566
00:29:49,255 --> 00:29:51,388
Get the fuck off the stage!

567
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,990
Relax!

568
00:29:52,992 --> 00:29:54,525
Let's go, motherfucker!

569
00:29:54,527 --> 00:29:56,193
Get the fuck back!

570
00:29:56,195 --> 00:29:59,263
(All shouting)

571
00:29:59,265 --> 00:30:03,567
Neck: All right, let's go.
We gotta roll,
we gotta roll!

572
00:30:03,569 --> 00:30:05,569
Lizzy: Whoo!

573
00:30:05,571 --> 00:30:10,507
Sugar: Have a nice night!
Grinder: Son of a bitch
with a weak-ass right.

574
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:12,075
(Indistinct conversation
on television)

575

(Train horn blares)

581
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:05,896
Fuck!

582
00:31:05,898 --> 00:31:07,297
(Horn continues blaring)

583
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:12,536
What the fuck?

584
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:16,907
What the fuck?

585
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:20,177
No! What the fuck?

586
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:23,914
Fuck! Fuck!

587
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:02,653
(Indistinct police
radio chatter)

588
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:36,119
Miss.

589
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:37,287
Hi.

590
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:40,357
Tom worked for me.

591
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:45,228
John wharton.

592
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,998
Caroline brentwood.
Homicide.

593
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,666
Can you help me
with next of kin?

594
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:51,601
There's some ex-wives.

595
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:56,073
So, what happened here?

596
00:32:56,075 --> 00:32:58,175
Train versus winnebago.

597
00:32:58,177 --> 00:32:59,609
Train won.

598
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:01,411
So why is homicide involved?

599
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:04,748
Well, some sucker's
got to write it up.
Guess that's me.

600
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:12,756
Anything else I can do?

601
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:14,257
Start sweeping for body parts.

602
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:17,694
Jackson: Caroline, hey,
I found the torso.

603
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:19,496
Caroline:
Coming to you!

604
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:28,438
Oh, geez.

605
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:31,174
Jackson: Look at this.

606
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,011
You can smell
the alcohol from here.

607
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:36,346
Yeah, right.

608
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:46,556
Your man's been drinking.

609
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:49,426
We did have a team celebration.

610
00:33:49,428 --> 00:33:52,262
As soon as I get
this place locked down,

611
00:33:52,264 --> 00:33:54,131
I need a statement from you.

612
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:02,706
You know who that is, right?

613
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:06,343
Some fed who thinks
his shit don't stink.

614
00:34:06,345 --> 00:34:07,711
That's John wharton.

615
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:11,181
He's a drug war God.

616
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,786
What... he looks
a little down, Darius.

617
00:34:15,788 --> 00:34:17,554
Why don't you go suck his dick?

618
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:20,257
That ain't right.

619
00:34:20,259 --> 00:34:22,692
Well, you're making
cow eyes at him.
That ain't right.

620
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:41,144
(Knocking)

621
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:44,514
(Footsteps approaching)

622
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,119
(Lizzy laughs)

623
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:54,357
Stripper's here!
Grinder: Whoo!
Ooh, yeah!

624
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:56,626
Aren't you a little
old for this shit?

625
00:34:56,628 --> 00:34:58,328
Investigator Caroline brentwood.

626
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,469
I'm looking for Eddie Jordan.

627
00:35:05,471 --> 00:35:07,104
Lizzy: Neck!
Yo!

628
00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:08,438
I brought you a present.

629
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,440
Grinder: Oh, shit.

630
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:11,441
(Sighs)

631
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:12,542
Look at the water.

632
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:13,610
(Pops)

633
00:35:15,881 --> 00:35:20,283
Have a fucking
drink for my friend.
We buried him today.

634
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:22,853
That's why I'm here.
You wanna go
somewhere private?

635
00:35:22,855 --> 00:35:24,855
Private?
(All laugh)

636
00:35:24,857 --> 00:35:27,424
Fuck that.
This is family time.

637
00:35:27,426 --> 00:35:29,392
You just get the fuck over here

638
00:35:29,394 --> 00:35:32,162
and make it clap
for Uncle daddy.
(All laugh)

639
00:35:32,164 --> 00:35:34,731
Look at you,
got the whole FBI getup.

640
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:37,300
You got your badge.

641
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:40,904
You dumb fuck,
that's the lead investigator

642
00:35:40,906 --> 00:35:42,706
in pyro's accident.
Am I right?

643
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:44,374
It's a fucking stripper!

644
00:35:44,376 --> 00:35:45,775
Lizzy: She's not
the stripper.

645
00:35:45,777 --> 00:35:47,544
She's an apd investigator.

646
00:35:47,546 --> 00:35:49,513
Neck: Damn.
Monster:
We'd welcome you.

647
00:35:49,515 --> 00:35:51,815
But I just want to know
what the fuck you
doing here right now.

648
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:54,184
Well, I'm sorry to
rain on your bro down.

649
00:35:54,186 --> 00:35:56,286
I just need to get
a quick statement.

650
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:59,356
Neck, lawyer the fuck up!
Don't say shit!

651
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:03,260
Neck hates cops
because the columbian police

652
00:36:03,262 --> 00:36:05,463
beat the living shit out of
him for not paying a tranny.

653
00:36:05,464 --> 00:36:08,932
Dude, you fucking
gotta bring that up
every fucking time!

654
00:36:08,934 --> 00:36:11,168
I got worse PTSD
from a dude in heels

655
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:13,303
than anything I got
in that fucking place.

656
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:15,372
Lizzy: I'll strip
for you, honey bear.

657
00:36:15,374 --> 00:36:16,873
(All laughing)

658
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,209
Neck: Get her, grinder.

659
00:36:20,212 --> 00:36:25,415
Pull your fucking panties
out of your ass, sweetheart,
and take the beer.

660
00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:27,417
It's a party.
(All laughing)

661
00:36:27,419 --> 00:36:29,553
Well, since you
put it like that.

662
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,662
I like the way you play.
Now lick it off.

663
00:36:38,664 --> 00:36:40,630
One step closer,
I rip your fucking
balls off.

664
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:42,699
Whoo!
Neck: Get her,
baby bird! Get her!

665
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:43,934
Hey! Shut the fuck up!

666
00:36:43,936 --> 00:36:45,268
Monster: Boss, come on!

667
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:47,237
Come on, settle down, shut up.

668
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:50,440
This is my fucking house,
okay? She's a guest!

669
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:53,944
Monster: Guest, my ass.
Come on. Let's go inside.

670
00:36:53,946 --> 00:36:55,979
Hit that, breach, get some!

671
00:36:55,981 --> 00:36:58,248
Investigate
the shit out of that.

672
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,616
Whose round it is?

673
00:36:59,618 --> 00:37:01,384
All: Pyro's!

674
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:03,353
(Laughs)

675
00:37:03,355 --> 00:37:06,923
I've been chasing
your man three days
for a five-minute interview.

676
00:37:06,925 --> 00:37:08,425
Can you do something about that?

677
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:15,365
You some kind of a big deal?

678
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:17,534
Yeah. I've been around.

679
00:37:17,536 --> 00:37:20,403
I speak to him tomorrow,
or I go over your head.

680
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:23,640
I will make it happen.
(Knocking)

681
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:28,378
Your friend's here.

682
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:33,416
I wouldn't bother.
Tips are lousy.

683
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:38,455
Caroline: Liquor store's
cleared by arrest.

684
00:37:38,457 --> 00:37:40,890
We present to
Nichols on Tuesday.
Jackson: No.

685
00:37:40,892 --> 00:37:42,392
Suspect has taken a plea.

686
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:44,728
Who says?
Nichols' office.

687
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:47,764
Funny how they do that
when they're on video.
Mmm-hmm.

688
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:51,534
(Inhales sharply)
Train versus rv.
It's ruled accidental,

689
00:37:51,536 --> 00:37:54,004
so I'm thinking this
is not our problem.

690
00:37:54,006 --> 00:37:56,873
I just have one
interview to do on that.
I'll knock it out tonight.

691
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:59,976
It's accidental.
Who cares?

692
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:02,979
Right, so no one should
interview the last guy
who saw him alive?

693
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,282
Perfectionist.

694
00:38:05,284 --> 00:38:06,750
(Cell phone vibrating)

695
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,621
Breacher. Gotta go.

696
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:12,822
Breacher. Damn.

697
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:16,393
He's sexting me.

698
00:38:16,395 --> 00:38:18,862
(Chuckles) All right, man,
just go. Go ahead.
Want to see?

699
00:38:18,864 --> 00:38:20,297
Get out of my face
with that, man.

700
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:21,298
He's a natural blond, you know.

701
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,832
Get out of my face.
Oh, yeah.

702
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:25,068
I don't want to hear
nothing about that.

703
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:27,370
You are dirty.

704
00:38:27,372 --> 00:38:28,438
Jezebel.

705
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:33,310
Caroline: I've known
some cops in my time,

706
00:38:33,312 --> 00:38:35,712
but your people
don't seem like cops.

707
00:38:35,714 --> 00:38:37,480
Good.

708
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,649
They're the best undercover
agents in the DEA.

709
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,752
Work hard, play hard, right?

710
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,554
(Chuckles)

711
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:46,389
Look who's talking.

712
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:47,991
You enjoy your cups.

713
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:50,627
Why do you say that?

714
00:38:50,629 --> 00:38:51,761
Your skin.

715
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:54,464
(Laughs)

716
00:38:54,466 --> 00:38:56,366
Wow.

717
00:38:56,368 --> 00:38:57,467
Just...

718
00:38:57,469 --> 00:38:58,935
Wow.

719
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:05,575
Wow.

720
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:12,582
Neck!

721
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:14,551
It's me!

722
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,088
(Flicks light switch)

723
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:20,390
Shit, no light.

724
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,025
Come on.

725
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,931
You don't need that.

726
00:39:27,933 --> 00:39:29,499
I'm a cautious girl.

727
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:31,501
Neck!

728
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:34,404
Wake up, you drunk fuck!

729
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:45,982
Breacher:
You got right. Move.

730
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:50,720
Caroline: Clear.

731
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:53,022
Breacher: Clear.

732
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,498
(Clatters)

733
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,833
Caroline: Sorry.

734
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:10,473
Breacher: (Whispers)
Let me clear this.

735
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,177
Breacher: Move.

736
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,451
Caroline: Clear.
Breacher: Okay.

737
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:32,796
Breacher:
Where the fuck is he?

738
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:36,699
Caroline: Oh, fuck!

739
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:41,104
(Gasps)

740
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:50,013
Would you help me up, please?

741
00:40:50,015 --> 00:40:51,214
Can you help me up, please?

742
00:40:57,988 --> 00:41:00,156
Thank you very much.

743
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:03,126
Well, we found him.

744
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,130
(Indistinct police
radio chatter)

745
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,877
You smoke?

746
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:24,514
Only when I find
my witnesses nailed
to the ceiling.

747
00:41:24,516 --> 00:41:26,516
Right. I'm gonna leave.

748
00:41:26,518 --> 00:41:28,852
No, you're not.
You're not fucking leaving!

749
00:41:28,854 --> 00:41:30,653
You're in this now.

750
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,589
What are you talking about?

751
00:41:32,591 --> 00:41:33,790
I'm a fed.

752
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:35,725
See you.

753
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:40,597
(Whispers) You're an asshole.

754
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:51,908
Firefighter: All right,
let's cut him down.

755
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:55,645
From a preliminary
investigation, I have
a cause of death.

756
00:41:55,647 --> 00:41:57,647
Massive hemothorax.

757
00:41:57,649 --> 00:42:00,083
From a right
ventricular
stab wound.

758
00:42:00,085 --> 00:42:02,285
This, where
my finger is...
Uh-huh.

759
00:42:02,287 --> 00:42:04,921
That's how far the knife
went inside his chest.

760
00:42:04,923 --> 00:42:07,223
Caroline: Okay.
Coroner: And they
gutted him like a pig.

761
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:10,927
Hey, doc,
this guy's a trained guy.

762
00:42:10,929 --> 00:42:12,929
Who could walk up on
a trained guy like that?

763
00:42:12,931 --> 00:42:15,198
Somebody that had
better skills than he had.

764
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,700
He knew exactly
where he was stabbing.

765
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:20,203
Boo-yah! Got some hairs.
Not the victim's.

766
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:22,739
Show me.
Right here.

767
00:42:22,741 --> 00:42:24,073
And here's some more. Here.

768
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:25,708
Can you bag those?
Sure.

769
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,911
I'll take them
to the lab myself.

770
00:42:27,913 --> 00:42:29,779
Okay.

771
00:42:29,781 --> 00:42:31,781
Thanks, guys.
Coroner: Sure.

772
00:42:31,783 --> 00:42:33,616
Thanks.
Assistant: You got it.

773
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:41,724
You know, in northern Ireland,
the ira nailed snitches
to the kitchen floor.

774
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:43,159
How do you know shit like that?

775
00:42:43,161 --> 00:42:44,961
Some research I was doing.

776
00:42:44,963 --> 00:42:48,131
Okay, so you put out a bolo
for lucky charms guy.
(Laughs)

777
00:42:48,133 --> 00:42:52,302
Hey, take a criminalist
and sweep the rv's cab.

778
00:42:52,304 --> 00:42:53,544
For what?
What am I looking for?

779
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,138
Linkage.

780
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,941
(Engine starts)

781
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,717
They're dead and we're not.
What are we doing?

782
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:10,753
We d-up and
present a hard target.

783
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:14,157
Like taking showers
with full body armor.

784
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:16,759
Well, we need fucking intel.

785
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:18,928
Who'd they send up?
Well, who do you think,
sweetheart?

786
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,063
Check the board!

787
00:43:20,065 --> 00:43:22,599
Could be soto!
Could be fucking romero!

788
00:43:22,601 --> 00:43:25,034
(Stammering)
They may be... fucking...

789
00:43:25,036 --> 00:43:26,970
Any of this a surprise to you?

790
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:29,872
Just let it go, huh?

791
00:43:29,874 --> 00:43:32,909
I don't really know
what you're talking about.

792
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:37,614
Guess I'm the only one
with any fucking balls here.

793
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:40,950
It's the goddamn money.

794
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:44,821
Monster: Just let
it go, all right?
No!

795
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:48,291
We had to go fingering
the devil's pussy.

796
00:43:48,293 --> 00:43:51,394
It's an occupational
hazard when you
fight the cartels.

797
00:43:51,396 --> 00:43:52,996
Oh, really?

798
00:43:52,998 --> 00:43:54,964
You see any other
feds getting smoked?

799
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:57,033
It could happen to anyone.
Bullshit!

800
00:43:58,035 --> 00:44:00,303
You believe that, chief?

801
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:04,240
Or is that just some shit
you're spitting in case
this place is bugged?

802
00:44:04,242 --> 00:44:07,310
Always assume that
someone is listening.

803
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:12,215
So shut the fuck up.

804
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:18,121
I ain't gonna fight you, boss.

805
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:36,733
Where the fuck are you going?

806
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,503
Out.

807
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:43,139
I'm bored.

808
00:45:43,141 --> 00:45:44,474
You're not going out.

809
00:45:44,476 --> 00:45:46,142
It's not safe.

810
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:48,845
They're hunting us.

811
00:45:48,847 --> 00:45:51,414
I can take care of myself.

812
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:55,485
Give that back to me.
Give that back to me!
Monster!

813
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:58,221
What's this, huh?

814
00:45:58,223 --> 00:45:59,223
Is this chewing gum?

815
00:45:59,224 --> 00:46:01,057
Huh?
Yeah.

816
00:46:01,059 --> 00:46:03,092
What the fuck you need this for?

817
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:05,061
What the fuck do
you need this for?

818
00:46:05,063 --> 00:46:06,162
(Knocking at door)

819
00:46:06,164 --> 00:46:07,864
Get out of my way.
No, lizzy.

820
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:17,173
(Lizzy laughs)

821
00:46:17,175 --> 00:46:19,008
It's the stripper.

822
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:20,309
Caroline:
Can we talk inside?

823
00:46:20,311 --> 00:46:21,591
Lizzy: What the fuck
do you want?

824
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,882
Just some background
information on
your unit.

825
00:46:25,884 --> 00:46:28,050
So I can develop some suspects.

826
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:35,358
You know what we do, right?

827
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,928
This special operations team?

828
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:40,263
Well, to be honest,
I have no idea.

829
00:46:40,265 --> 00:46:41,898
Why don't you tell me?

830
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:43,900
We covertly

831
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:46,302
penetrate

832
00:46:47,871 --> 00:46:50,473
drug organizations.

833
00:46:50,475 --> 00:46:53,209
I guess that
would make you
some enemies, huh?

834
00:46:53,211 --> 00:46:55,011
Any one come
to mind?
(Both laugh)

835
00:46:55,013 --> 00:46:56,412
Any particular guy

836
00:46:56,414 --> 00:47:00,550
that might nail special agent
Jordan to a ceiling?

837
00:47:00,552 --> 00:47:02,451
Are you really
this stupid?
(Laughs)

838
00:47:02,453 --> 00:47:04,453
Ma'am, I'm not your friend,

839
00:47:04,455 --> 00:47:05,888
and I'm not your colleague.

840
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:07,423
So don't bully me.

841
00:47:07,425 --> 00:47:08,491
Or I'll slap you

842
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:09,892
with a 48-hour jail hold.

843
00:47:09,894 --> 00:47:13,496
You can't hack a day
without your favorite
controlled substance.

844
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:15,097
So let's keep it nice, shall we?

845
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:17,266
And yes, assume I'm stupid.

846
00:47:17,268 --> 00:47:18,868
Paint me a picture.

847
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:20,970
Please.

848
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:30,913
I took these in juarez.

849
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:33,616
They're friends of mine.

850
00:47:33,618 --> 00:47:35,918
And this is what
the rios-garza cartel does

851
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,987
to indicate that
you've pissed them off.

852
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:44,961
Sweetheart,
you're so in over
your fucking head.

853
00:47:44,963 --> 00:47:47,630
You need more
than a glock and
sensible shoes.

854
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:49,932
Monster:
Walk away.

855
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:52,001
Walk away.

856
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:00,409
I'll show myself out.
Thank you for your time.

857
00:48:00,411 --> 00:48:01,944
It's our pleasure.

858
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,014
Lab technician:
We're gonna have
to each get two jobs

859
00:48:05,016 --> 00:48:06,549
just to put him through school.

860
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:08,284
Caroline: Have you
considered prostitution?

861
00:48:08,286 --> 00:48:10,286
Hey, what's up?
More black hairs.

862
00:48:11,022 --> 00:48:15,157
A beautiful thumbprint
we got off the steering
column of the rv.

863
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:17,493
It's not the Vic's.
Boo-yeah! Linkage.

864
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:20,496
You just said
"boo-yeah."

865
00:48:20,498 --> 00:48:23,065
That's my thing.
Don't Jack my thing.

866
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,970
I heard the lab tech
say it. (Laughs)

867
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:29,939
I didn't hear it.

868
00:48:29,941 --> 00:48:31,274
Bullshit, you heard it.

869
00:48:31,276 --> 00:48:33,009
Well, if she said it,
she got it from me.

870
00:48:36,046 --> 00:48:38,614
Due to the staging
of special agent
Jordan's body,

871
00:48:38,616 --> 00:48:41,550
we believe
there's a connection
to the rios-garza cartel.

872
00:48:41,552 --> 00:48:44,654
Dto. Rios-garza drug
trafficking organization.

873
00:48:44,656 --> 00:48:46,923
We don't use
the term "cartel."

874
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:49,325
Thank you, sir.

875
00:48:49,327 --> 00:48:50,693
It seems that special agent
Roberts' death

876
00:48:50,695 --> 00:48:52,628
was not an accident.

877
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:54,931
We have recovered
physical evidence linking
the two crime scenes.

878
00:48:54,933 --> 00:48:56,565
I would like to have
a copy of those files,

879
00:48:56,567 --> 00:48:58,134
if you could make
those available for me.

880
00:48:58,136 --> 00:49:00,670
Yes, sir.
Today, would that
be all right?

881
00:49:00,672 --> 00:49:03,139
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

882
00:49:03,141 --> 00:49:05,675
Investigator brentwood,
what exactly do
you want from us?

883
00:49:05,677 --> 00:49:08,644
Well, learning about
the victims helps me
find the suspects.

884
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:12,114
Maybe these murders
are blowback from
cases they worked on.

885
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:14,417
You want access
to DEA case files?

886
00:49:14,419 --> 00:49:16,252
It would help.

887
00:49:16,254 --> 00:49:18,521
Are you asking for
investigatory support
or access to our records?

888
00:49:18,523 --> 00:49:19,622
Both.

889
00:49:19,624 --> 00:49:20,690
Look, maybe there's someone

890
00:49:20,692 --> 00:49:22,024
I can liaise with,
someone who...

891
00:49:22,026 --> 00:49:26,062
your agency needs to
draft a formal letter
requesting assistance.

892
00:49:26,064 --> 00:49:29,165
Any documents you want
access to will need to
be specifically cited.

893
00:49:29,167 --> 00:49:31,200
Specifically cited.
What information
do you need?

894
00:49:31,202 --> 00:49:34,036
Incident report numbers.
File numbers.

895
00:49:34,038 --> 00:49:36,439
And how are we going
to know those numbers

896
00:49:36,441 --> 00:49:38,374
if we don't know those numbers?

897
00:49:38,376 --> 00:49:39,976
If you don't know
really what you want,

898
00:49:39,978 --> 00:49:42,278
what are you doing here?

899
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,547
Two murders of DEA agents

900
00:49:44,549 --> 00:49:46,215
have happened on my watch.

901
00:49:46,217 --> 00:49:48,017
And it's my job to
investigate them,

902
00:49:48,019 --> 00:49:50,219
and I'm asking for your help.

903
00:49:50,221 --> 00:49:52,862
Just have the chief
fire off a letter, and
we'll see what we can do.

904
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:55,725
Thank you for coming in.

905
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,361
Caroline:
Have a nice day, y'all.

906
00:49:58,363 --> 00:50:01,364
Fucking us attorney
and their own general counsel?

907
00:50:01,366 --> 00:50:02,732
These guys are scared.

908
00:50:02,734 --> 00:50:05,001
Hey. You're brentwood,
you're Jackson, right?

909
00:50:05,003 --> 00:50:07,636
You working the agent
nailed to the ceiling?

910
00:50:07,638 --> 00:50:09,372
What do you know about that?

911
00:50:09,374 --> 00:50:11,507
The DEA is a dysfunctional
family, all right?

912
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:13,476
No one's going to talk
family business with you.

913
00:50:13,478 --> 00:50:14,710
Who are you?
Got a card?

914
00:50:14,712 --> 00:50:19,115
Everything happens
for a reason.
Think about that.

915
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:26,522
Stop leaving your
shit on my seat.

916
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:28,190
That's not mine.

917
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:30,292
It's not some porn
you're hiding from
your wife?

918
00:50:30,294 --> 00:50:31,627
(Scoffs)

919
00:50:31,629 --> 00:50:33,062
That's not mine.

920
00:50:33,064 --> 00:50:34,663
It's not mine.

921
00:50:34,665 --> 00:50:37,233
Stan: <i> You're out here saving</i>
<i>these adrenaline junkies</i>

922
00:50:37,235 --> 00:50:40,302
<i>that mean absolutely nothing</i>
<i>to this department.</i>

923
00:50:40,304 --> 00:50:42,038
Breacher: <i> I would take</i>
<i>a bullet for those guys.</i>

924
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,305
<i>Hmm. You'd take a bullet.</i>

925
00:50:43,307 --> 00:50:44,540
<i>Would you take 10 million bucks?</i>

926
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:46,609
<i>Would you take $10 million?</i>

927
00:50:46,611 --> 00:50:48,144
<i>Where's the money?</i>

928
00:50:48,146 --> 00:50:51,313
<i>Where's the money?</i>
<i>You dumb fuck, you!</i>

929
00:50:51,315 --> 00:50:52,615
<i>Look at you!</i>

930
00:50:52,617 --> 00:50:54,483
<i>With your fucking 48% body fat.</i>

931
00:50:54,485 --> 00:50:57,186
<i>And, you, scrawny</i>
<i>little bastard!</i>

932
00:50:57,188 --> 00:50:58,828
<i>Fuck you guys!</i>
Lou: <i> Go to the gym, John.</i>

933
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:02,525
Fucking liar.
Fucking liar!

934
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:04,093
He's a fucking liar.

935
00:51:04,095 --> 00:51:07,129
What? Caroline,
where you going?

936
00:51:07,131 --> 00:51:08,197
(Knocking)

937
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:17,740
you were under investigation
for stealing from
the rios-garza cartel?

938
00:51:17,742 --> 00:51:19,375
Get in.

939
00:51:19,377 --> 00:51:20,576
I need a drink.

940
00:51:41,865 --> 00:51:43,766
I need you to be
straight with me, John.

941
00:51:43,768 --> 00:51:45,701
No, you be straight with me.

942
00:51:45,703 --> 00:51:47,670
Why do I have to find out
through the grapevine

943
00:51:47,672 --> 00:51:49,305
that you linked
the deaths of my people?

944
00:51:49,307 --> 00:51:50,840
They're linked,
I'm sorry. My turn.

945
00:51:50,842 --> 00:51:52,408
Did you steal the money?

946
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:54,176
No.

947
00:51:54,178 --> 00:51:56,212
And fuck you
for asking.
Don't be such a girl.

948
00:51:56,214 --> 00:51:59,548
Your agency thinks you did.
So does the rios-garza cartel.

949
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:01,717
Why do you think
they're killing your guys?

950
00:52:01,719 --> 00:52:04,553
Spend enough
time on the job,
the job bites back.

951
00:52:04,555 --> 00:52:06,222
That's bullshit.

952
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:11,227
You going somewhere?

953
00:52:11,229 --> 00:52:13,729
One of my guys
quit the team.
He's off the grid.

954
00:52:13,731 --> 00:52:15,865
I gotta warn him.

955
00:52:15,867 --> 00:52:18,334
Okay, grab your stuff
and I'll drive.

956
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:24,373
<i>They're going to continue</i>
<i>to fucking kill people,</i>

957
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:28,777
<i>and women and children</i>
<i>in Mexico and</i>
<i>the United States</i>

958
00:52:28,779 --> 00:52:30,579
<i>unless you have</i>
<i>guys like me!</i>
Lou: <i> Son!</i>

959
00:52:30,581 --> 00:52:31,780
<i>That's a fact.</i>
<i>Son!</i>

960
00:52:31,782 --> 00:52:33,682
<i>Motherfucker, I quit.</i>

961
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:42,324
Last fall, an 8-year-old girl
vanished from her bed.

962
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:47,530
Only her daddy's bullshit
about hearing black voices.

963
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:52,801
And he's a drinker.
Joins aa the week
after she disappears.

964
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:54,837
He profiles, too.

965
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:57,206
Domestic abuser, all that.

966
00:52:57,208 --> 00:52:58,307
And I can't find enough

967
00:52:58,309 --> 00:52:59,608
for the da to file.

968
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:03,679
Just because you're
not in jail doesn't
mean you didn't do it.

969
00:53:04,614 --> 00:53:05,614
You're awesome on a road trip,

970
00:53:05,616 --> 00:53:06,715
you know that?

971
00:53:06,717 --> 00:53:09,185
Yeah, I've heard that before.

972
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:25,935
Breacher: That's it,
right there.

973
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:34,843
It's beautiful.

974
00:53:34,845 --> 00:53:36,378
Watch out for booby traps.

975
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:39,515
Caroline: Bullshit.

976
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,351
Breacher: I'm serious.

977
00:53:42,353 --> 00:53:44,753
This could take
your leg right off.

978
00:53:44,755 --> 00:53:46,589
Here's the trip wire.

979
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:53,429
Why is he so paranoid?

980
00:53:53,431 --> 00:53:55,351
Maybe he doesn't want to
get nailed to a ceiling.

981
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:09,878
Tripod!

982
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:18,354
Mcneely?

983
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:21,290
It's John!

984
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:36,872
There's something off.

985
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:23,686
(Screams)

986
00:56:12,736 --> 00:56:13,902
Fuck.

987
00:56:18,074 --> 00:56:19,641
Unit 2150.

988
00:56:21,077 --> 00:56:24,480
Send me two units
and an me to my location.

989
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:55,411
Ak brass.

990
00:56:59,048 --> 00:57:00,883
The guy hit the trip wire.

991
00:57:01,851 --> 00:57:03,152
Right there.

992
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:13,729
Looks like he bled out.

993
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,067
Here, hold this.

994
00:57:27,076 --> 00:57:28,577
Caroline:
What's that?

995
00:57:28,579 --> 00:57:30,145
Breacher:
They're world-class assholes.

996
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:35,617
Give me the weapon.
I don't trust you.

997
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:37,853
Well, you know,
it was getting
heavy anyway.

998
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:43,992
(Groaning)

999
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:46,562
(Men laughing)

1000
00:57:52,569 --> 00:57:53,969
(Knocking)
Hey! (Gasps)

1001
00:57:55,038 --> 00:57:56,705
How you feeling?

1002
00:57:58,241 --> 00:57:59,842
I'm sorry?

1003
00:57:59,844 --> 00:58:02,511
Well, now that
you got sucked
into our world.

1004
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:09,718
They're kaibiles.

1005
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,687
Kaibiles?

1006
00:58:11,689 --> 00:58:13,722
Guatemalan special forces.

1007
00:58:13,724 --> 00:58:18,527
Rios-garza organization
loves to use them
for high-power hits.

1008
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:24,833
You know, mcneely was
a fucking Navy seal.

1009
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:31,540
He was 10 times
the operator that
I'll ever be.

1010
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:37,112
What chance do you think I got?

1011
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:43,719
See, they're the best
assassins that money
can buy.

1012
00:58:43,721 --> 00:58:46,021
Honey, I worked gangs
for eight years.

1013
00:58:46,023 --> 00:58:47,890
Streets have rules, okay?

1014
00:58:47,892 --> 00:58:49,525
You steal money,
doesn't matter
who you are,

1015
00:58:49,527 --> 00:58:51,260
you can be a cop,
you could be God,

1016
00:58:52,128 --> 00:58:54,096
they will get you.

1017
00:58:54,098 --> 00:58:56,632
I came here to help you.

1018
00:58:56,634 --> 00:58:58,600
No, you did not.
To help you understand.

1019
00:58:58,602 --> 00:59:00,002
You came here 'cause you
think you're gonna be next.

1020
00:59:00,004 --> 00:59:02,137
You came here to steer me, okay?

1021
00:59:02,139 --> 00:59:03,705
If you want to help me,

1022
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:05,173
and if you don't
want to get nailed
to a ceiling

1023
00:59:05,175 --> 00:59:07,276
or run over by a train,

1024
00:59:07,278 --> 00:59:09,678
you need to break
free from your buddies

1025
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:12,848
and tell me something
I don't know about
John wharton.

1026
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:13,916
Because I can't read him.

1027
00:59:13,918 --> 00:59:15,284
Tell me something I don't know.

1028
00:59:21,925 --> 00:59:23,892
Two years ago,

1029
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:26,895
<i>we arrested</i>
<i>Edgar rios in juarez.</i>

1030
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:29,765
<i>He was</i>
<i>an old-school drug lord,</i>
<i>ran all their operations.</i>

1031
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:40,776
<i>It was a big deal.</i>

1032
00:59:55,124 --> 00:59:57,292
<i>We're handing him</i>
<i>over to the Mexicans</i>

1033
00:59:59,662 --> 01:00:02,064
<i>when some broad</i>
<i>pulls her shit</i>
<i>and dumps him.</i>

1034
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:09,137
<i>Cartel didn't</i>
<i>want him debriefed</i>
<i>by our intel people.</i>

1035
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:14,276
<i>Problem solved.</i>

1036
01:00:15,044 --> 01:00:16,778
(Inaudible)

1037
01:00:21,684 --> 01:00:25,053
<i>But they had a bigger problem.</i>

1038
01:00:25,055 --> 01:00:29,191
<i>They wanted the man</i>
<i>who can get the man</i>
<i>that nobody can get.</i>

1039
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:38,634
<i>John gets a call</i>

1040
01:00:39,268 --> 01:00:40,636
<i>from the bad guys.</i>

1041
01:00:43,272 --> 01:00:47,109
<i>They snatched his wife</i>
<i>and kid right out of</i>
<i>his house on lake lanier.</i>

1042
01:00:48,344 --> 01:00:50,245
<i>They're holding them in juarez.</i>

1043
01:00:51,748 --> 01:00:54,282
<i>They make him an offer.</i>

1044
01:00:54,284 --> 01:00:58,120
<i>"Surrender yourself</i>
<i>to the cartel and</i>
<i>your family lives."</i>

1045
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:00,922
<i>John's family is everything.</i>

1046
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,659
<i>John was married forever.</i>

1047
01:01:05,128 --> 01:01:08,030
<i>His son Jacob was</i>
<i>his best friend.</i>

1048
01:01:08,032 --> 01:01:09,197
Love you, dad.

1049
01:01:10,867 --> 01:01:12,701
(Screaming)

1050
01:01:12,703 --> 01:01:15,671
<i>They tortured Karen</i>
<i>and Jacob to death.</i>

1051
01:01:15,673 --> 01:01:18,106
<i>There's video.</i>
<i>Evil shit.</i>

1052
01:01:18,108 --> 01:01:24,746
Monster:
<i>They mailed pieces of them</i>
<i>to his home for weeks.</i>

1053
01:01:24,748 --> 01:01:26,748
(Screaming)
<i>Oh, my God!</i>
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

1054
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:33,722
Monster: <i> So John</i>
<i>went down there. Alone.</i>

1055
01:01:34,891 --> 01:01:37,793
<i>Hunting the man</i>
<i>who killed his wife.</i>

1056
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:40,395
Tripod:
John, we're coming in!

1057
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:52,841
Monster:
<i>He didn't find him.</i>

1058
01:01:55,178 --> 01:01:57,045
We're here to
bring you back home.

1059
01:01:59,415 --> 01:02:01,817
This isn't going
to bring them back.

1060
01:02:20,803 --> 01:02:22,137
Tripod: Come on.
Let's go home.

1061
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:27,843
Monster: <i> John is</i>
<i>obsessed with finding</i>
<i>his wife's killer.</i>

1062
01:02:31,214 --> 01:02:33,381
<i>It's like a cancer in his soul.</i>

1063
01:02:40,289 --> 01:02:43,825
Caroline, we lost John
when they died.

1064
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:50,065
Go home.

1065
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:56,304
Go home now.

1066
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:00,041
I was just trying to help.

1067
01:03:11,921 --> 01:03:13,188
I'm sorry.

1068
01:03:14,257 --> 01:03:16,024
I'm so sorry.

1069
01:03:22,098 --> 01:03:24,432
John.

1070
01:03:24,434 --> 01:03:27,869
Wait up. I didn't
know about your family.
John, I'm sorry, I...

1071
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:32,574
Now you know.

1072
01:03:32,576 --> 01:03:34,543
They sent me her face.

1073
01:03:38,181 --> 01:03:39,815
I'm sorry.

1074
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:44,452
I'm sorry.

1075
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:03,572
So this isn't creepy.

1076
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:07,108
Someone else get killed?

1077
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:09,244
I brought a peace offering.

1078
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:23,458
Let me show you something.

1079
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:28,063
Your shooters.
They're Guatemalan
special forces.

1080
01:04:28,065 --> 01:04:30,866
They came in
through juarez
with stolen visas.

1081
01:04:30,868 --> 01:04:33,535
Ice alerted, ran surveillance.

1082
01:04:33,537 --> 01:04:35,470
But lost them
outside of Atlanta.

1083
01:04:35,472 --> 01:04:37,372
Now, you said you had prints.

1084
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:40,976
Yeah. We got one
at the rv,

1085
01:04:40,978 --> 01:04:42,878
and one outside mcneely's cabin.

1086
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:44,880
But no ncic hits.

1087
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:47,015
See if these match.

1088
01:04:52,288 --> 01:04:54,055
Pretty please.

1089
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:03,999
Ice took them off
some beer cans inside
their hotel room.

1090
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:07,469
Should I have these?

1091
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:09,537
No.

1092
01:05:12,108 --> 01:05:14,075
Then why'd you give them to me?

1093
01:05:15,278 --> 01:05:17,512
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

1094
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:35,964
Holy shit.

1095
01:05:39,135 --> 01:05:41,603
No way.

1096
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:45,540
Don't say a word.

1097
01:05:45,542 --> 01:05:47,008
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

1098
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:49,678
What happened to
"I'll never date a cop"?

1099
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:52,314
Who said anything about a date?

1100
01:05:52,316 --> 01:05:53,648
Evil harlot.

1101
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:56,518
I can't believe you said that.

1102
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,019
You dirty, dirty girl.

1103
01:05:59,355 --> 01:06:00,555
So I got a present for you.

1104
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:02,958
Check that out.

1105
01:06:04,727 --> 01:06:05,994
Oh!

1106
01:06:06,997 --> 01:06:10,632
Dude looks like
Mario from <i> donkey Kong.</i>
Mmm-hmm.

1107
01:06:10,634 --> 01:06:13,234
Who's the metrosexual
with the... you've got...

1108
01:06:13,236 --> 01:06:16,237
Prints, records, everything.

1109
01:06:16,239 --> 01:06:17,639
Did he leave it on
your night stand?

1110
01:06:17,641 --> 01:06:19,207
You don't want to know.
(Sighs)

1111
01:06:19,209 --> 01:06:21,209
Shit.

1112
01:06:21,211 --> 01:06:24,012
Get in the car.
You all right?
'Cause you walking funny.

1113
01:06:24,014 --> 01:06:25,380
You're just jealous.

1114
01:06:26,582 --> 01:06:29,284
Is he a big dude?

1115
01:06:29,286 --> 01:06:32,087
Like, is he big?

1116
01:06:32,089 --> 01:06:33,621
That's inappropriate.

1117
01:06:33,623 --> 01:06:35,623
Was it good?
Shut up. Shut up.

1118
01:06:35,625 --> 01:06:36,591
Is he ripped,
like a six-pack?

1119
01:06:36,593 --> 01:06:38,159
Shut up.

1120
01:06:38,161 --> 01:06:40,362
Just wondering.
'Cause he's, like,
a legend.

1121
01:06:40,364 --> 01:06:41,730
You're good to go.

1122
01:06:41,732 --> 01:06:43,732
It's a match.
(Sucking teeth)

1123
01:06:45,634 --> 01:06:48,436
Thank you, tish.
Okay, I'm going to write out
a warrant-affidavit.

1124
01:06:48,438 --> 01:06:50,772
You put out a bolo,
armed and dangerous.

1125
01:06:50,774 --> 01:06:54,609
That we got slipped
some secret squirrel
ice file?

1126
01:06:54,611 --> 01:06:58,446
Once they're in custody,
we can get as many
print cards as we want.

1127
01:06:58,448 --> 01:07:01,016
Doesn't matter
how we get there,
as long as we get there.

1128
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:04,152
Do we know where they are?

1129
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:06,621
Negative.

1130
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:10,225
So we still got no target?

1131
01:07:10,227 --> 01:07:15,130
We could be drinking beers,
throwing dollars
at something naked.

1132
01:07:15,132 --> 01:07:16,731
We're standing by.

1133
01:07:16,733 --> 01:07:18,733
For what?

1134
01:07:18,735 --> 01:07:22,604
Apparently, the boss
got that investigator
lady working for us now.

1135
01:07:22,606 --> 01:07:24,072
Ain't that right, boss?

1136
01:07:24,074 --> 01:07:25,074
Is that true?

1137
01:07:29,145 --> 01:07:30,445
Hey. Grab a vest.

1138
01:07:30,447 --> 01:07:35,050
That ice file your
boyfriend gave you
had a credit card.

1139
01:07:35,052 --> 01:07:36,584
I linked it to a cell phone.

1140
01:07:36,586 --> 01:07:38,686
That cell phone is live
in an apartment building.

1141
01:07:38,688 --> 01:07:40,688
That apartment building,
narco knows about it.

1142
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:42,757
It's a rios-garza
safe house.

1143
01:07:42,759 --> 01:07:45,393
Okay, enough
energy drinks, partner.

1144
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:49,564
While you've
been saving mankind,
I drafted an affidavit.

1145
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:52,267
I sent it to the clerk,
judge signed it.

1146
01:07:52,269 --> 01:07:54,736
Yes, you're right.
I need that.
Okay.

1147
01:07:54,738 --> 01:07:56,137
You're right.
I'm sorry. I was excited.

1148
01:07:56,139 --> 01:08:00,475
I got excited about it,
but we gotta go
kick some doors, baby.

1149
01:08:00,477 --> 01:08:02,544
(Cell phone vibrating)

1150
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:24,299
Multi-level residential.
Four units.

1151
01:08:24,301 --> 01:08:27,235
Brick and masonry.
Fortified with
barred windows.

1152
01:08:27,237 --> 01:08:31,673
Steel security doors.
You got an iron fence
around three sides.

1153
01:08:31,675 --> 01:08:33,541
All right,
what's the plan, boss?

1154
01:08:33,543 --> 01:08:35,143
Breacher: (Over radio)
<i>We blue angel up the back.</i>

1155
01:08:35,145 --> 01:08:38,113
Single point dynamic entry.
Explosive breach.

1156
01:08:38,115 --> 01:08:39,514
We don't know
what unit they're in,

1157
01:08:39,516 --> 01:08:43,885
All right, let's smoke
these motherfuckers and
get us some dinner then.

1158
01:08:43,887 --> 01:08:45,753
Two Mikes out.

1159
01:08:45,755 --> 01:08:47,589
Sugar: <i> Two out, copy.</i>

1160
01:08:47,591 --> 01:08:49,224
We're at the railroad tracks.

1161
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:51,292
Here we go, stand by.

1162
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:52,460
Lizzy: <i> Roger that.</i>

1163
01:08:52,462 --> 01:08:54,896
We're not here to
make arrests, right?

1164
01:09:14,884 --> 01:09:16,151
Breacher: Breach!

1165
01:09:22,758 --> 01:09:26,528
They killed two
federal agents already.
They're not fucking around!

1166
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:29,230
No matter what,
we all go home tonight
at the end of this mission.

1167
01:09:29,232 --> 01:09:30,932
(Indistinct police
radio chatter)

1168
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:34,903
(Gun clicking)

1169
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:37,918
You know what you're
doing with that thing?

1170
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:39,841
I was in the army.

1171
01:09:39,843 --> 01:09:42,177
It's the wrong way up.
It's not the wrong way up.

1172
01:09:42,179 --> 01:09:43,378
You got to rack it
all the way back.

1173
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:44,679
Come on.

1174
01:09:44,681 --> 01:09:46,281
I know how to rack a gun.

1175
01:09:53,290 --> 01:09:56,624
Breacher:
Keep your hands up.
Let me see your hands.

1176
01:09:56,626 --> 01:09:58,526
Stay right there.
(Baby crying)

1177
01:09:58,528 --> 01:09:59,688
Grinder:
Stay on the bed, kid.

1178
01:10:00,429 --> 01:10:01,429
Shitty closet!

1179
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:03,231
Clear!

1180
01:10:03,233 --> 01:10:04,766

Good! Let's go!

Got a bathroom! Clear!

All clear!
Clear.

Grinder: One on the couch!
Lizzy: I got left.

1190
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:31,720
Put your hands up!

Sugar: Closet, clear!
Breacher:
Let me see your hands!

1192
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:35,763
Anyone else in here?

1193
01:10:35,765 --> 01:10:37,298
Sugar: Coming around.

1194
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:38,933
Anyone else in here?
Just my kids.

1195
01:10:38,935 --> 01:10:40,969
Kids in the back!

1196
01:10:40,971 --> 01:10:42,337

We're clear!

1204

Moving.

1205
01:10:54,484 --> 01:10:56,251
Just stay on the bed.

1206
01:10:56,253 --> 01:10:58,019
Stay on the bed.

Okay. Ready?

1210
01:11:05,494 --> 01:11:07,328
Yup. Door.

1211
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,707
Sugar: You get him!
Go, go, go. Let's roll.

1212
01:11:19,709 --> 01:11:20,975
Okay, move it!

1213
01:11:22,478 --> 01:11:23,745
Fuck!

1214
01:11:23,747 --> 01:11:24,907
Monster: We're tight, pop it!

1215
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:28,883
Lizzy: Asshole down!

1216
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,327
We're clear!

1217
01:11:50,572 --> 01:11:51,673
Lizzy: Fuck!

1218
01:11:54,877 --> 01:11:56,644
Lizzy: Target down.
Move! Move! Move!

1219
01:12:07,556 --> 01:12:08,656
Clear!

1220
01:12:16,565 --> 01:12:17,699
Clear!

1221
01:12:17,701 --> 01:12:18,800
Lizzy: Clear!

1222
01:12:19,802 --> 01:12:20,802
Sugar, let's go.

1223
01:12:26,475 --> 01:12:29,410
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa!
<i>Calmate!</i> Easy! Easy!

1224
01:12:29,812 --> 01:12:31,112
(Screams)

1225
01:12:31,114 --> 01:12:32,814
Lizzy: Good kill, baby.
Monster: Come on!

1226
01:12:32,816 --> 01:12:33,748
I got the hostage.
Clear!

1227
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:35,516
Going right!

1228
01:12:35,518 --> 01:12:36,718
Clear!
Lizzy: Clear!

1229
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:40,588
We're clear!
Sugar: Clear!

1230
01:12:40,590 --> 01:12:43,958
Good fucking gunfight!
God damn!

1231
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,993
Hello.
Sugar: Hey, boss!

1232
01:12:45,995 --> 01:12:47,395
You might want to get in here!

1233
01:12:47,996 --> 01:12:49,397
What?

1234
01:12:50,766 --> 01:12:52,667
Lizzy: Ta-da!

1235
01:12:52,669 --> 01:12:54,769
You got your kit, babe?

1236
01:12:54,771 --> 01:12:56,851
Monster:
Right, we're secure.
I'm gonna ID these guys.

1237
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,741
So which asshole are you?

1238
01:12:59,743 --> 01:13:01,642
Lizzy, don't fucking do that!

1239
01:13:01,644 --> 01:13:03,845
(Laughs)
Liquid meth! Hell yeah!

1240
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:07,434
Grinder: You're one
fucked up bitch!
(Laughs)

1241
01:13:08,951 --> 01:13:10,551
Yeah, it's meth.

1242
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:11,719
Lizzy: This is one
for the books.

1243
01:13:11,721 --> 01:13:12,721
Monster: Breach.

1244
01:13:14,022 --> 01:13:15,723
It's not them.

1245
01:13:15,725 --> 01:13:16,824
Grinder: It's not
the kaibiles!
Lizzy: What do you mean?

1246
01:13:16,826 --> 01:13:19,794
You mean we killed
six motherfuckers
and it ain't them?

1247
01:13:19,796 --> 01:13:21,429
Well, check again!

1248
01:13:21,431 --> 01:13:22,597
Okay.

1249
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:26,768
No! Still not them!

1250
01:13:26,770 --> 01:13:29,137
Dead man walking!
Fuck me!

1251
01:13:29,139 --> 01:13:30,438
Fucking shit.

1252
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:33,408
(Sirens wailing)

1253
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:46,721
(Indistinct police
radio chatter)

1254
01:13:55,063 --> 01:13:56,464
Stay tight.
Behind you, brother.

1255
01:14:16,018 --> 01:14:17,218
All right, it's clear.

1256
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:19,687
Get ems in here.

1257
01:14:19,689 --> 01:14:21,055
There's a lot of bodies.

1258
01:14:22,157 --> 01:14:23,691
What the fuck
are you doing here?

1259
01:14:24,893 --> 01:14:26,194
It's my job.

1260
01:14:26,895 --> 01:14:28,563
You used me.

1261
01:14:33,235 --> 01:14:34,702
SWAT team lead:
Breacher, God damn it!

1262
01:14:34,704 --> 01:14:36,537
What the fuck is going on here?

1263
01:14:36,539 --> 01:14:38,673
Clean up,
aisle three.
(Laughs)

1264
01:14:39,942 --> 01:14:42,043
God almighty!

1265
01:14:42,045 --> 01:14:44,078
What's wrong?
Son of a bitch
is snagged!

1266
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:45,480
Gimme a knife.
I'm gonna cut
the son of a bitch.

1267
01:14:45,482 --> 01:14:47,482
The hell you are.
That's a new anchor.

1268
01:14:47,484 --> 01:14:49,183
Damn, it is heavy,
though.
Yeah, it is!

1269
01:14:49,185 --> 01:14:51,085
All right, keep pulling.

1270
01:14:52,254 --> 01:14:54,188
What the hell?

1271
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:56,591
Jesus Christ!
Stay back, son!

1272
01:14:56,593 --> 01:14:58,059
Turn around.
Don't look.

1273
01:15:23,852 --> 01:15:25,186
Caroline: How'd they die?

1274
01:15:25,188 --> 01:15:27,054
Doctor:
Looks like a gun fight.

1275
01:15:27,056 --> 01:15:29,056
Can you give me race and sex?

1276
01:15:29,058 --> 01:15:31,192
Male hispanics, all three.

1277
01:15:31,194 --> 01:15:33,528
Caroline:
Why the chicken wire?

1278
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:37,932
As their bodies bloat,
the wire cuts them,
releasing the decomp gas.

1279
01:15:37,934 --> 01:15:40,034
They never float to the surface.

1280
01:15:40,036 --> 01:15:42,270
Jackson: Yeah, great tip.
I gotta remember that one.

1281
01:15:42,272 --> 01:15:43,804
Okay, how long they been dead?

1282
01:15:43,806 --> 01:15:45,006
A week.
You sure?

1283
01:15:45,008 --> 01:15:46,807
A what?
At least a week.

1284
01:15:46,809 --> 01:15:49,243
If it's the guys
that we think...

1285
01:15:49,245 --> 01:15:51,546
They've been dead
more than a week...
Wait, are these the...

1286
01:15:51,548 --> 01:15:53,848
The military guys
from the cartel?
Yeah.

1287
01:15:53,850 --> 01:15:55,950
You think this is them?
The Guatemalans.

1288
01:15:55,952 --> 01:15:57,218
I think it's them.

1289
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:58,920
He said they've
been dead for a week.

1290
01:15:58,922 --> 01:16:00,588
It can't be the Guatemalans.

1291
01:16:00,590 --> 01:16:02,723
Caroline: That's why
we need to find these tattoos.

1292
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:05,192
The guy at the cabin
had a tattoo on
his left shoulder.

1293
01:16:05,194 --> 01:16:07,595
And if we have a match,
then they're part of
the same gang, right?

1294
01:16:07,597 --> 01:16:08,930
The killers are the victims?

1295
01:16:08,932 --> 01:16:10,665
It just can't be that, Caroline.

1296
01:16:10,667 --> 01:16:12,333
Caroline:
Tattoo, left shoulder.
Have we got anything?

1297
01:16:12,335 --> 01:16:14,602
Ah, nice!

1298
01:16:14,604 --> 01:16:16,971
We got it.
Darius, come see this.

1299
01:16:16,973 --> 01:16:18,306
This is our guy.

1300
01:16:18,308 --> 01:16:20,708
Jackson: That's it?
Mmm-hmm.

1301
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:21,710
Who the hell killed them?

1302
01:16:21,711 --> 01:16:22,977
Nice.

1303
01:16:22,979 --> 01:16:23,945
Doctor: Here we go.

1304
01:16:23,947 --> 01:16:25,012
Caroline: What you got?

1305
01:16:26,315 --> 01:16:28,049
Thumb's missing.

1306
01:16:28,051 --> 01:16:30,785
Right here.
Right.

1307
01:16:30,787 --> 01:16:36,223
Okay, so that explains
how we got thumbprints
in Roberts' rv, huh?

1308
01:16:36,225 --> 01:16:37,745
Jackson: Looks like
we're working late.

1309
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:51,138
Look, if they've been dead
a week already, right?

1310
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:53,841
They sure as hell
didn't nail Jordan
to that ceiling.

1311
01:16:53,843 --> 01:16:55,876
Or drive Roberts
over the train tracks.

1312
01:16:55,878 --> 01:16:58,613
Caroline: The Guatemalans
killed tripod mcneely, okay?

1313
01:16:58,615 --> 01:17:01,082
Then somebody kills them,
uses them for cover.

1314
01:17:01,084 --> 01:17:03,217
Come on, Darius, think about it.

1315
01:17:03,219 --> 01:17:05,186
Who killed the cartel hit men,

1316
01:17:05,188 --> 01:17:07,922
sprinkles their DNA
over two separate
crime scenes,

1317
01:17:07,924 --> 01:17:09,991
wants us to
think they're alive?
Who do we like for this?

1318
01:17:09,993 --> 01:17:13,361
Everybody! We like
everybody for this one!

1319
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:28,242
Karen: (On tape)
<i>John, please! John!</i>

1320
01:17:28,244 --> 01:17:30,011
Brujo: <i> Tell John</i>
<i>to come for you!</i>
<i>John! Please, John!</i>

1321
01:17:30,013 --> 01:17:32,847
<i>Tell him come for you!</i>
<i>John!</i>

1322
01:17:32,849 --> 01:17:35,650
<i>Come find me! John!</i>

1323
01:17:36,418 --> 01:17:38,185
<i>Please!</i>

1324
01:17:38,187 --> 01:17:39,253
(Screams)

1325
01:17:41,256 --> 01:17:42,323
(Groans)

1326
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:44,258
<i>Oh, no!</i>

1327
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:54,902
<i>We had a good time, didn't we?</i>

1328
01:17:54,904 --> 01:17:56,270
(Groans)

1329
01:17:58,974 --> 01:18:00,841
(Karen breathing heavily)

1330
01:18:05,747 --> 01:18:07,782
<i>I love you, John!</i>

1331
01:18:08,817 --> 01:18:09,817
(Gunshot)

1332
01:18:22,831 --> 01:18:24,732
(Cell phone vibrating)

1333
01:18:34,242 --> 01:18:36,844
(Continues vibrating)

1334
01:19:14,182 --> 01:19:16,183
Who the fuck is hunting us?

1335
01:19:16,185 --> 01:19:19,019
Lizzy: Who do
you think, breach?

1336
01:19:19,021 --> 01:19:20,387
It's one of us.

1337
01:19:21,189 --> 01:19:22,323
It's you!

1338
01:19:22,325 --> 01:19:24,125
Or it's grinder!

1339
01:19:24,127 --> 01:19:26,393
Or sugar!
Or my dear
loving husband!

1340
01:19:27,996 --> 01:19:29,296
Is it you, bitch?

1341
01:19:29,298 --> 01:19:31,099
Lizzy: No, I keep track
of the people I whack.

1342
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:34,368
Neck and pyro ain't on the list.

1343
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:36,804
See, I think that she's right!

1344
01:19:36,806 --> 01:19:40,808
I think she's fucking right.
Nailed it.

1345
01:19:40,810 --> 01:19:42,143
So which fucker is it, huh?

1346
01:19:47,015 --> 01:19:49,850
Fucking crazy!
I mean, why?

1347
01:19:49,852 --> 01:19:52,086
You know why, breach.
It was the fucking money.

1348
01:19:52,088 --> 01:19:53,788
Sugar: Amen.

1349
01:19:53,790 --> 01:19:56,257
'Cause some of us
are getting paid,

1350
01:19:56,259 --> 01:19:58,459
and the rest of us
are just getting dead.

1351
01:19:58,461 --> 01:20:00,327
Oh, bullshit!

1352
01:20:00,329 --> 01:20:03,164
Keep your hands
where we can see them.

1353
01:20:03,166 --> 01:20:06,534
This has been fun,
but I'm out of here.

1354
01:20:06,536 --> 01:20:09,203
I see any of
your fucking faces
and I'll kill you!

1355
01:20:10,238 --> 01:20:12,339
Ammo's cheap.
My life ain't!

1356
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:17,244
It's over.

1357
01:20:17,246 --> 01:20:20,080
Lizzy: Where'd you
bury it, grinder?
(Motorcycle revs)

1358
01:20:28,890 --> 01:20:30,925
Breacher:
Now we fall apart?

1359
01:20:32,194 --> 01:20:34,829
We scatter to the wind?

1360
01:20:34,831 --> 01:20:36,096
Lizzy: Yeah,
I like that idea.

1361
01:20:39,201 --> 01:20:40,968
Honey.

1362
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:42,269
Yes, sweetheart?

1363
01:20:43,905 --> 01:20:45,940
I've been fucking sugar.

1364
01:20:48,476 --> 01:20:50,044
Sugar: What the fuck
are you doing?

1365
01:20:51,146 --> 01:20:53,147
That's not what we talked about!

1366
01:20:53,149 --> 01:20:54,215
Look, man.

1367
01:20:55,183 --> 01:20:57,518
Look, it is what it is, dude.

1368
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:00,087
What do you want me to say?
You want me to say I'm sorry?

1369
01:21:00,089 --> 01:21:02,223
Is it gonna make it any better?

1370
01:21:02,225 --> 01:21:04,024
You fucker!
I'm going to kill you!

1371
01:21:04,026 --> 01:21:05,426
Monster! No!

1372
01:21:05,428 --> 01:21:08,395
I thought you were
my fucking friend!

1373
01:21:08,397 --> 01:21:11,165
Boss, I'm gonna kill him!
I'm gonna fucking kill him!

1374
01:21:11,167 --> 01:21:13,367
Get the fuck out of here!

1375
01:21:13,369 --> 01:21:15,436
Why the fuck would
you do that shit?

1376
01:21:15,438 --> 01:21:17,104
Get the fuck out of here!

1377
01:21:17,106 --> 01:21:19,607
Fucking have a nice life,
you fucking cunt!

1378
01:21:19,609 --> 01:21:20,609
You deserve each other!

1379
01:21:22,978 --> 01:21:24,311
I warned you.

1380
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:28,349
We fucked up.

1381
01:21:29,985 --> 01:21:31,619
We fucked up, didn't we?

1382
01:21:33,488 --> 01:21:36,991
(Indistinct conversation
on radio)

1383
01:21:44,366 --> 01:21:45,366
What do you want?

1384
01:21:46,067 --> 01:21:47,234
Can we talk?

1385
01:21:49,037 --> 01:21:50,437
We stole the money.

1386
01:21:53,375 --> 01:21:55,643
It was breacher's idea.

1387
01:21:55,645 --> 01:21:57,611
We thought it
would make him happy.

1388
01:21:58,947 --> 01:22:00,614
It was $10 million in cash.

1389
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:04,351
Went back for it that night,

1390
01:22:04,353 --> 01:22:07,221
but when we got there,
it was gone.

1391
01:22:08,957 --> 01:22:10,491
DEA, they wanted
to throw us
in a hole

1392
01:22:10,493 --> 01:22:13,093
and throw away the hole.

1393
01:22:13,095 --> 01:22:16,030
Crawled up our asses
with a microscope
for six months.

1394
01:22:16,631 --> 01:22:18,165
Nobody broke.

1395
01:22:20,168 --> 01:22:21,669
So who has the money?

1396
01:22:23,305 --> 01:22:24,371
It's lizzy.

1397
01:22:25,273 --> 01:22:27,107
Or monster or sugar.

1398
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:29,944
I don't know.

1399
01:22:29,946 --> 01:22:31,346
She's playing one
against the other.

1400
01:22:32,681 --> 01:22:34,949
What do you want to do?

1401
01:22:34,951 --> 01:22:37,251
Fuck them all.
Let them hang.

1402
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:50,331
After I lost my family,

1403
01:22:50,333 --> 01:22:52,700
I asked myself what
was I fighting for.

1404
01:22:54,102 --> 01:22:55,569
The answer was simple.

1405
01:22:55,571 --> 01:22:56,704
My team.

1406
01:22:58,340 --> 01:23:01,241
I wanted them to get
something out of all of this.

1407
01:23:01,243 --> 01:23:02,243
But instead,

1408
01:23:04,446 --> 01:23:06,113
I destroyed them.

1409
01:23:08,083 --> 01:23:10,517
Agent Phillips is
going to the DEA.

1410
01:23:17,058 --> 01:23:19,626
I'm not telling you
it's gonna be okay.

1411
01:23:22,130 --> 01:23:23,230
Because it's not.

1412
01:23:24,265 --> 01:23:26,166
Not for you.

1413
01:23:28,403 --> 01:23:29,403
(Motorcycle approaches)

1414
01:23:40,281 --> 01:23:41,281
(Door opens)

1415
01:23:46,654 --> 01:23:48,322
Hey, John.
Hey.

1416
01:23:53,294 --> 01:23:54,294
I'm sorry.

1417
01:23:55,597 --> 01:23:57,264
Don't apologize.

1418
01:24:00,602 --> 01:24:03,037
I would have
stepped up
if you didn't.

1419
01:24:04,706 --> 01:24:06,407
You're doing the right thing.

1420
01:24:07,742 --> 01:24:09,676
I ride this ship down.

1421
01:24:10,812 --> 01:24:12,146
I ride it down.

1422
01:24:13,281 --> 01:24:15,416
But you,

1423
01:24:15,418 --> 01:24:17,184
you could still
have a life after this.

1424
01:24:17,186 --> 01:24:18,652
Doing what, John?

1425
01:24:19,754 --> 01:24:21,088
Where?

1426
01:24:21,790 --> 01:24:23,690
This is all I do.

1427
01:24:23,692 --> 01:24:25,259
And it's over.

1428
01:24:27,362 --> 01:24:29,296
We can protect you.

1429
01:24:29,298 --> 01:24:31,398
(Gunshot) (Customers screaming)

1430
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:32,533
Get down!

1431
01:24:33,501 --> 01:24:34,568
Breacher: Stay down.

1432
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:38,806
(Gunshot)

1433
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:41,141
(Gunshot)

1434
01:24:50,585 --> 01:24:53,153
Tell me again.

1435
01:24:53,155 --> 01:24:55,656
We were up the block,
heard gunfire.

1436
01:24:55,658 --> 01:24:58,459
We made contact with
a female DEA agent.

1437
01:24:58,461 --> 01:25:00,160
Female DEA agent?

1438
01:25:00,162 --> 01:25:02,229
She left in a vehicle
with a black male.

1439
01:25:02,231 --> 01:25:05,299
Jackson: A DEA agent.
You heard gunfire!

1440
01:25:05,301 --> 01:25:07,501
Sir, she badged us.
She was legit.

1441
01:25:07,503 --> 01:25:08,702
Jackson: She left.

1442
01:25:08,704 --> 01:25:10,571
Is this the woman you saw?

1443
01:25:10,573 --> 01:25:11,872
Yeah. That's her.

1444
01:25:14,142 --> 01:25:15,275
You said "black male"?

1445
01:25:15,277 --> 01:25:17,644
Yes, sir.
A red vehicle.

1446
01:25:17,646 --> 01:25:19,513
Sugar.
That's your guy, too?

1447
01:25:50,778 --> 01:25:52,146
Breacher: Clear.

1448
01:25:58,186 --> 01:25:59,386
What's all this?

1449
01:25:59,388 --> 01:26:01,855
She's bailing.

1450
01:26:01,857 --> 01:26:04,458
She'll never make it.
Every cop in Georgia's
looking for her.

1451
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:05,926
She won't get far.

1452
01:26:06,628 --> 01:26:07,928
Yes, she will.

1453
01:26:12,867 --> 01:26:14,735
Monster: Do you think
that he loves you?

1454
01:26:14,737 --> 01:26:17,938
What do you think the plan is?
To just go run
off and make babies?

1455
01:26:19,807 --> 01:26:21,441
Well, you're gonna
be needing this.

1456
01:26:26,648 --> 01:26:27,781
Just give me my shit

1457
01:26:27,783 --> 01:26:29,650
and quit fucking around.

1458
01:26:38,726 --> 01:26:40,827
Don't do it! Monster!

1459
01:26:40,829 --> 01:26:42,196
(Garbage disposal whirring)

1460
01:26:43,498 --> 01:26:44,698
Fuck you!

1461
01:26:46,534 --> 01:26:48,202
(Wheezing)

1462
01:26:50,438 --> 01:26:51,438
Oh, fuck.

1463
01:26:52,607 --> 01:26:54,575
Baby, I'm sorry!

1464
01:26:54,577 --> 01:26:56,243
(Groaning)

1465
01:26:56,245 --> 01:26:57,344
(Screams)

1466
01:26:57,346 --> 01:26:58,946
Baby. Oh, God.

1467
01:27:00,415 --> 01:27:01,648
Lay down.

1468
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:07,254
I'm sorry, monster.
I'm sorry.

1469
01:27:07,256 --> 01:27:08,488
(Shushing)

1470
01:27:20,401 --> 01:27:21,401
(Gasps)

1471
01:27:21,403 --> 01:27:22,703
Oh, Jesus!

1472
01:27:25,406 --> 01:27:26,640
Jesus!

1473
01:27:56,871 --> 01:27:58,805
I'm going to kill her.

1474
01:28:00,508 --> 01:28:02,309
(Cell phone ringing)

1475
01:28:03,544 --> 01:28:04,811
Yeah?

1476
01:28:04,813 --> 01:28:06,880
Lizzy: <i> Hey. I fucked up.</i>

1477
01:28:06,882 --> 01:28:08,782
<i>I didn't mean</i>
<i>for this to happen.</i>
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

1478
01:28:08,784 --> 01:28:11,051
Where are you?
<i>Midtown.</i>

1479
01:28:11,053 --> 01:28:13,453
Are you alone?
<i>Yeah, I'm alone.</i>

1480
01:28:13,455 --> 01:28:15,756
Who would I be with?

1481
01:28:15,758 --> 01:28:19,493
<i>Can I see you?</i>
Meet me inside
the parking structure on 4th.

1482
01:28:19,495 --> 01:28:21,795
<i>Thanks, breach.</i>
<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

1483
01:28:24,499 --> 01:28:27,467
That motherfucker!

1484
01:28:27,469 --> 01:28:28,735
Parking garage?

1485
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:30,570
Mmm.

1486
01:28:30,572 --> 01:28:32,973
This ain't his first rodeo.

1487
01:28:32,975 --> 01:28:34,608
Since he wants to be a hero,

1488
01:28:36,077 --> 01:28:37,577
let's give him somebody to save.

1489
01:28:42,917 --> 01:28:47,321
Federal agent!
Get out of the fucking car!
Did you hear me?

1490
01:28:47,323 --> 01:28:49,056
Open the fucking door!
Open the fucking door!

1491
01:28:49,058 --> 01:28:50,390
Lizzy: Get out of
the fucking car!

1492
01:29:05,006 --> 01:29:07,507
There she is. Get down.

1493
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:41,375
(Groans)

1494
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:43,910
He's down!
He's down!

1495
01:29:51,152 --> 01:29:52,486
Who the fuck is that in the car?

1496
01:29:57,625 --> 01:29:58,792
Shit!
(Car alarm blaring)

1497
01:29:58,794 --> 01:29:59,826
It's that bitch!

1498
01:30:18,813 --> 01:30:19,880
Breacher: Go, go, go!

1499
01:30:20,515 --> 01:30:21,748
(Horn honking)

1500
01:30:29,023 --> 01:30:31,191
Hold your ass, sweetie!
Here we go!

1501
01:30:41,736 --> 01:30:42,869
Jesus Christ!

1502
01:30:45,006 --> 01:30:46,907
Take the vest!

1503
01:30:46,909 --> 01:30:48,675
Put it on the dash
and stay down!

1504
01:30:51,078 --> 01:30:52,746
Fuck me!

1505
01:30:52,748 --> 01:30:54,214
Lizzy, handle that motherfucker!

1506
01:30:58,052 --> 01:30:59,119
(Screams)

1507
01:30:59,754 --> 01:31:00,787
Oh, fuck!

1508
01:31:10,965 --> 01:31:12,666
Oh, baby, I fucked
that bitch up!

1509
01:31:14,902 --> 01:31:15,969
Jesus Christ!

1510
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:19,539
Fuck!

1511
01:31:30,685 --> 01:31:31,818
Get the fuck out of the way!

1512
01:31:41,062 --> 01:31:42,762
Lizzy: We lost them, sug!

1513
01:31:42,764 --> 01:31:44,030
Oh, shit.

1514
01:31:44,032 --> 01:31:45,932
We're gonna make it, baby.
We're gonna make it!

1515
01:31:50,505 --> 01:31:51,905
Fuck, he's still coming!

1516
01:31:53,541 --> 01:31:54,875
(Screams)

1517
01:31:54,877 --> 01:31:56,276
Let's give him a 180!

1518
01:32:04,952 --> 01:32:06,253
Shit!

1519
01:32:06,255 --> 01:32:07,954
Breacher: Turn around!
Turn around!

1520
01:32:07,956 --> 01:32:08,996
Caroline: I can't make it!

1521
01:32:11,058 --> 01:32:12,259
Sugar: Baby,

1522
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:14,261
kill that motherfucker!

1523
01:32:19,767 --> 01:32:20,767
Fuck!

1524
01:32:27,141 --> 01:32:28,275
Shoot the fucking engine!

1525
01:32:30,011 --> 01:32:31,578
Fucking die!

1526
01:32:37,685 --> 01:32:39,246
Lizzy: Now, get us
the fuck out of here!

1527
01:32:40,087 --> 01:32:41,154
Fuck!

1528
01:32:42,657 --> 01:32:43,890
I got no eyes!

1529
01:32:43,892 --> 01:32:45,292
I can't see shit!

1530
01:32:46,961 --> 01:32:47,961
(Screaming)

1531
01:32:48,195 --> 01:32:49,629
(Brakes squeal)

1532
01:32:49,631 --> 01:32:50,631
(Screaming)

1533
01:33:03,744 --> 01:33:05,645
(Vehicle approaching)

1534
01:33:06,747 --> 01:33:07,914
(Gasping)

1535
01:33:13,588 --> 01:33:15,655
Caroline:
Drop the weapon, lizzy!

1536
01:33:15,657 --> 01:33:17,357
(Lizzy gasping)

1537
01:33:21,929 --> 01:33:22,963
(Groans)

1538
01:33:26,834 --> 01:33:28,902
Okay. Okay.

1539
01:33:29,904 --> 01:33:31,304
(Sirens wailing)

1540
01:33:31,306 --> 01:33:32,772
Hey, breach.

1541
01:33:35,343 --> 01:33:37,143
Breacher:
You killed my team.

1542
01:33:38,245 --> 01:33:40,714
Why, lizzy? Why?

1543
01:33:40,716 --> 01:33:43,350
Because they stole
my money! Huh!

1544
01:33:44,118 --> 01:33:46,386
They fucking robbed me!

1545
01:33:46,388 --> 01:33:48,722
After everything I put up with!

1546
01:33:48,724 --> 01:33:51,191
It was my money
and they took it,
and I couldn't find it!

1547
01:33:52,193 --> 01:33:54,027
I said, "fuck them."

1548
01:33:54,029 --> 01:33:55,729
(Laughs)

1549
01:33:55,731 --> 01:33:58,765
I took the money.
I took it.

1550
01:33:58,767 --> 01:34:00,133
You took the money?

1551
01:34:01,202 --> 01:34:02,369
What does that mean?

1552
01:34:03,704 --> 01:34:04,704
Why?

1553
01:34:08,776 --> 01:34:10,043
Mexico.

1554
01:34:11,178 --> 01:34:13,046
This is about fucking Mexico?

1555
01:34:14,115 --> 01:34:17,217
Your family is
never coming home!

1556
01:34:18,185 --> 01:34:19,986
What is she talking about?

1557
01:34:19,988 --> 01:34:22,389
And nothing you do

1558
01:34:22,391 --> 01:34:23,923
will ever change that!

1559
01:34:26,027 --> 01:34:27,060
You hear me?

1560
01:34:31,365 --> 01:34:33,400
