26
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,657
Police on scene are approaching the suspect.

27
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,743
This chase started at approximately 1:30 a.m...

28
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,579
...in the Mercer Island area...

29
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:46,248
...and has ended here at Pearl Street Bridge.

30
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,916
--responding to a 911 call...

31
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:51,086
...in an apparent carjacking by an African-American male.

32
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,255
--name is Lisa Reane...

33
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,757
...youngest daughter of Congressman Richard Reane.

34
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,676
Suspect has been preliminary ID'd...

35
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:02,973
...as John Curtis, who's wanted for armed robbery, drug--

36
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,454
Shots have been fired.

37
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,792
We have shots fired.

38
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,853
The suspect and his hostage are down.

39
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,105
Police are moving in.

40
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,311
If you chose to believe a traitor's testimony, fine.

41
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:52,272
But in the same situation, I'd do it again.

42
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,441
I'm not gonna apologize for doing my job.

43
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,610
I'm not gonna apologize for doing my job.

44
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,893
Simply put, just because you're a cop...

45
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:33,146
...doesn't mean the laws don't apply to you.

46
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,524
It's not the wild, wild West anymore.

47
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,277
It's not the wild, wild West anymore.

48
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,487
Not the wild, wild West anymore.

49
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:43,073
Wild, wild West anymore.

50
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,540
That's 5 and....

51
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,523
Everybody get the fuck down!

52
00:05:58,691 --> 00:05:59,733
Get out of here!

53
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,234
Let's get moving!
 Move! Move!

54
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:04,112
Get off that chair, you stupid bitch!
 Let's go!

55
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:05,960
Get off the phone!

56
00:06:05,986 --> 00:06:06,973
Put the phone down!

57
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,326
You people move forward!

58
00:06:08,352 --> 00:06:09,309
Move! Move! Move!

59
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,494
Get out your phones!

60
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,412
Get out your cell phones!
In the bag!

61
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,127
That you don't wanna do.

62
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,973
Shut the fuck up.

63
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:35,435
Oh, y'all picked the wrong day not to use the ATM.

64
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,646
Get down.

65
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,399
Do what you're told when you're told...

66
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,484
...you may live.

67
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,277
But I make no guarantees.

68
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,286
-I'm in.
-You, up.

69
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,831
-You, out.
-Let's go. Move.

70
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:59,418
Your security system, you can electronically seal off the entrances.

71
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,670
Yes. Right away.

72
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,506
Fabulous.
Oh, what a wonderful attitude.

73
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,008
You and I are gonna get along just fine.

74
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,522
It's done.

75
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,409
We're locked down.

76
00:07:22,435 --> 00:07:23,675
Smashing.

77
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,216
Gonna be late for work.

78
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,863
Fire in the hole!

79
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,033
What do you think you're doing?

80
00:08:23,059 --> 00:08:24,569
Fucker set off the alarm.

81
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:28,590
Don't you think it would have made sense to shoot him before he set it off?

82
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,425
Probably.

83
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:31,785
Jesus. All right.

84
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:33,703
The alarm's been tripped.

85
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:34,712
We're on a clock.

86
00:08:34,738 --> 00:08:36,623
Let's get these people out of here.

87
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,893
Next time, if you're gonna do something, do it right.

88
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,036
This is Detective Galloway.

89
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,487
Gonna have to go back that way, sir.

90
00:09:12,513 --> 00:09:13,410
Back that way.

91
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,767
I want all points of entry identified and covered.

92
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,386
Nina, you need SWAT here now.

93
00:09:23,412 --> 00:09:25,463
Have emergency crews standing by.

94
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:26,982
Didn't take them long.

95
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:28,900
Come on, man.

96
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,197
-Set a perimeter. Move them back.
-How far?

97
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:35,407
Portland.

98
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,499
Detective Callo.

99
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,510
Hey. Got him on the line.

100
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:05,270
-We're on.
-This is Detective Callo, Seattle P.D.

101
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,188
-Who am I speaking to?
-No questions.

102
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,403
I'm in control of this facility now.

103
00:10:09,429 --> 00:10:10,508
Complete control.

104
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:13,153
Nobody gets in or out without my say.

105
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,363
I will execute every man, woman and child...

106
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:16,823
...if my needs are not met.

107
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,409
All right, don't test me.

108
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,287
-I'm a man of zero tolerance today.
-I'm listening.

109
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,123
All right.
Well, try not to screw this up, huh, detective?

110
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:29,002
I only have one demand, and one demand only.

111
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,356
Do you have a warrant?

112
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,232
I need to speak to you, Quentin.

113
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,861
That's where you're shit out of luck, because I don't need to speak to you.

114
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,404
It's important.

115
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,539
Do you live in a barn?

116
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,502
That's Detective Shane Dekker.

117
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,046
Doesn't look like much of a detective.

118
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,881
I could say the same about you.

119
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,927
-Charming.
-Shane just transferred from Tacoma.

120
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,763
-You might be interested to know--
-Save your breath.

121
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,223
I really don't care.

122
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,769
Just get to what's on your mind.

123
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:31,398
We got a hostage situation over at American Global...

124
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:35,402
...and he won't talk to anybody but you.

125
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:39,197
-No shit?
-No shit.

126
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,865
So we need you to do this.

127
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,367
Why should I?

128
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,869
Because people's lives are at risk.

129
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,080
Yeah, like the kid said.

130
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,604
Say I did wanna help, I'm suspended.

131
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,526
Or did that slip your mind?

132
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,796
Well, as of right now, you are back on the force.

133
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,465
-Just like that.
-Just like that.

134
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:02,011
I won't, however, unleash you alone.

135
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,972
Always a catch.

136
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,640
Shane here is your new partner.

137
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:09,477
You can consider him a younger version of me.

138
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,523
How nice.

139
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:17,485
-You'd have been with your partner--
-Ex-partner.

140
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:22,073
On the unemployment line long time ago.

141
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,326
You know, for a moment, I thought you cared.

142
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,956
Where are you going?

143
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,534
Yep. I'm here now.

144
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,051
I'll let you know.

145
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,386
Could we have a few words?

146
00:13:06,412 --> 00:13:08,394
Yeah. I'll give you two: Blow me.

147
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,288
Need a follow-up comment, let me know.

148
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,126
-Terrific.
-Talked to him about 9:30.

149
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:18,254
Nine-thirty. All right, 9:30. Okay.

150
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:20,173
Teddy, Vincent, nice to see you both.

151
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:25,678
Okay, so Conners has been reinstated to full active duty, and it's his scene.

152
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,056
Last time this guy headed a hostage situation...

153
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,557
...an innocent civilian died.

154
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,601
I was not responsible.

155
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,394
Well, you never are.

156
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:37,232
That girl would be alive today if it wasn't for your cowboy antics.

157
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,441
You destroy lives.

158
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:41,110
Well, look who's talking about destroying lives.

159
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:44,030
I seem to remember that's your fucking specialty, Callo.

160
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,740
Ladies, please.

161
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,911
I was first on the scene, and I have seniority.

162
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,530
Decision's been made, Bernie.

163
00:13:51,556 --> 00:13:52,856
Don't do this, Martin.

164
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,791
Don't cave in to this guy.

165
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,460
Bernie, I need you to take a hike.

166
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,379
All right? We'll talk about it later.

167
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,512
Fine.

168
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,557
I'll watch the train wreck from home.

169
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,225
Bye, Bernie.

170
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:15,019
Okay, SWAT, because of special circumstances...

171
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,188
...we'll defer to Conners.

172
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,357
He's in charge.

173
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,943
First I heard SWAT defer to anyone.

174
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:25,446
Now, I want you to do the folks in the bank a big favor...

175
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:28,950
...by proving me very wrong about you, okay?

176
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,619
Oh, that's an order.

177
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:37,041
Anything questionable happens today, I wanna know about it, okay?

178
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,751
Yes, sir.

179
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:43,047
Looks like you got yourself a babysitter.

180
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:04,444
We have approximately four to seven heavily armed men...

181
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:07,030
...holding an unspecified number of customers...

182
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,448
...and employees hostage.

183
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,783
You're just a wealth of knowledge, Vincent.

184
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:13,620
Their only demand so far has been to speak to you.

185
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,937
Get me a line into the bank.

186
00:15:15,963 --> 00:15:17,190
Let's see what they want.

187
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,666
Okay.

188
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,014
Well, well, well.

189
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:36,100
If it isn't Detective Conners.

190
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,352
Who am I speaking with?

191
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,854
Well, for now, call me Lorenz.

192
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,523
Okay, Lorenz. How we doing in there?

193
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:45,109
Get you anything?
Food, medical supplies perhaps?

194
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,445
We heard an explosion.

195
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,156
Everyone who matters is fine.

196
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:53,868
Of course, I would have preferred the authorities not be involved at all...

197
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:57,372
...but since Seattle's finest needs a presence on the scene...

198
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,207
...I'm glad it's you.

199
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,074
Oh, well. My fame precedes me.

200
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,402
Don't be flattered.

201
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:05,755
I needed to have someone who's been through this experience before...

202
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:11,803
...because, detective, I plan on living a long, full, rich life.

203
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,723
However, I am surprised that they found you so quickly.

204
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:19,268
-I thought you were suspended.
-I was.

205
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,729
But I'm back.
 Your information's old.

206
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:24,399
You never get what you pay for.

207
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,069
Well, I guess you wanna know about the hostages?

208
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,445
Yes.

209
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:34,242
There's approximately 40, and they're doing just swell.

210
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,536
Well, all of them except one.

211
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,496
Someone's dead?

212
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:43,501
Theory put to practice isn't always perfect.

213
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:47,880
You can't keep the hostages in check if you let a bad deed go unpunished.

214
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,842
They might just randomly revolt.

215
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,387
Chaos has some order to it.

216
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,098
What else will I be looking for?

217
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,558
Demands.

218
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:02,270
Wouldn't be too much to ask for you and your colleagues just to bounce?

219
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,855
Safe to say.

220
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,608
All right.
Well, you just stay by the phone, and I'll-- I'll contact you.

221
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,610
-Hey, wait, Lorenz.
-Don't worry.

222
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,780
I don't have any plans until sunrise tomorrow.

223
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:16,325
Relax. It's gonna be a long one.

224
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,635
Hey, come on, Lorenz.

225
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,562
This conversation's not finished.

226
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,665
Patience, detective. Patience.

227
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:26,127
We don't want this to be another Pearl Street Bridge, now, do we?

228
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,053
He's out.

229
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:39,223
This standoff is reaching two hours now.

230
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:43,061
We've been told detectives have made contact with the perpetrators...

231
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:46,355
...but whether specific demands have been made, we cannot confirm.

232
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,524
When we're in the know, we'll let you know.

233
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:51,819
I'm Karen Cross live for Channel 2 news.

234
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,384
Where's our fearless captain?

235
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,678
He went uptown to brief the commissioner.

236
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,806
And you're here in his place.

237
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,271
-What's that?
-Nicotine gum.

238
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,442
You quit smoking?

239
00:18:28,468 --> 00:18:30,591
Caffeine, too, if you must know.

240
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:33,444
-What? A man's capable of change.
-Yeah.

241
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,499
Don't worry.

242
00:18:34,525 --> 00:18:36,570
I still have a vice or two.

243
00:18:36,596 --> 00:18:39,183
Detective, 15 rings. No answer.

244
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,536
Try again in five.

245
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,121
What are they doing in there?

246
00:18:43,147 --> 00:18:44,564
Wasting our fucking time.

247
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,170
Precisely.

248
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:54,549
He knows police protocol, not to mention the shit in our own precinct.

249
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,050
He's disguising his voice.

250
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,886
Probably means he's got a record and has done this before.

251
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,888
Dropped that hint about sunrise.

252
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,057
He's buying time.

253
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,269
-Why?
-He's trying to figure out his move.

254
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,715
He wasn't expecting us.

255
00:19:07,741 --> 00:19:09,297
He wasn't expecting you.

256
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,232
He said he thought you were suspended.

257
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,735
Probably thought it'd take all day to find me, giving him time he needs.

258
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:17,572
-He's stalling.
-He almost has what he came for.

259
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:18,865
We're going in.

260
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,705
Where is the SWAT commander?

261
00:19:23,731 --> 00:19:25,313
I'll find him.

262
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,286
That's a big call.

263
00:19:26,312 --> 00:19:28,065
You thought about what you're doing?

264
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,803
Are you questioning me, Teddy?

265
00:19:30,829 --> 00:19:32,904
Unfortunately, yeah.

266
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:35,381
Well, I question how you can fuck that asshole...

267
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:38,092
...and still manage to look in the mirror.

268
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,470
Look, the hostages are in imminent danger.

269
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,185
They've confessed to killing.

270
00:19:43,211 --> 00:19:45,291
That's an automatic murder-one charge,

271
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,435
Life sentence, a needle for all of them.

272
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,062
So why keep witnesses around to testify?

273
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,142
The longer we wait, the greater the risk.

274
00:19:53,168 --> 00:19:54,800
We need to go in.
Now.

275
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,152
Quentin.

276
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:01,574
-So, what we got?
-Snipers up top.

277
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,451
Ten soldiers on the ground.

278
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,689
What's the best way in?

279
00:20:04,715 --> 00:20:06,062
Tear gas. Blow the doors.

280
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,289
Hey, hold on. No explosives.

281
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,798
We got 40 civilians in there.

282
00:20:09,824 --> 00:20:11,025
It's too great a chance.

283
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,501
Any other way?

284
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,212
No. There's no pussy way in.

285
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,089
The doors are locked electronically from the inside...

286
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,133
...and we ain't getting in without force.

287
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,483
What if we cut the power?

288
00:20:22,509 --> 00:20:23,829
That'll disable the system.

289
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:27,350
We can open the locks manually, go in that way.

290
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,477
That'll work.

291
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,438
So we'll take the pussy way in, commander.

292
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:36,442
Cut the power and we go in at 11:15 sharp.

293
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,972
The banks are equipped with generators.

294
00:20:43,998 --> 00:20:45,268
Once the power's down...

295
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,704
...they'll kick back on in approximately three to six minutes.

296
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,623
Be over before then.

297
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:54,085
-Commander, your men in position?
-Standing by.

298
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,878
Call for the power to be cut.

299
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,047
Once down, wait for my signal.

300
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:01,026
Nobody moves until I give the go.

301
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:02,159
Understood?

302
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:04,011
Yep.

303
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,521
You, come here.

304
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:14,814
Come here.

305
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,483
Come on.

306
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:17,717
Get up.

307
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,695
No!

308
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,826
Will you just shut the fuck up?

309
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:41,048
Here they come.

310
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,054
Stand still.
 I said don't move.

311
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,686
Okay, let's go around the horn.

312
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,731
-One, check.
-Two, check.

313
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:59,859
-Three, check.
-Four, check.

314
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,530
Here we go.

315
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,324
Cut the power.

316
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:10,369
What?

317
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:13,998
Now.

318
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,784
Hey, hold on. Hold on.

319
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,112
What just happened?

320
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,467
Holy shit.

321
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,098
Shit. Come on, guys.

322
00:22:30,124 --> 00:22:31,957
Let's get a move on.

323
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,029
We're moving in.

324
00:22:33,055 --> 00:22:35,086
Stand the fuck down, commander.

325
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,772
-It's a trap.
-No, you stand the fuck down.

326
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,422
This is my show now.

327
00:22:39,448 --> 00:22:41,300
Repeat, do not go in.

328
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,324
On my count.

329
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:46,013
Three, two, one.

330
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,573
Move!

331
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,292
Go!

332
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:33,994
Round up all the hostages!

333
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,994
Anyone that comes out, you grab them!

334
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,356
Every single one of them!

335
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,333
Got the emergency crews over here.

336
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,086
Secure the area.

337
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:46,006
Medics! Paramedics here!

338
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,634
Anyone in the bank!

339
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:14,957
You see anybody come your way?

340
00:25:14,983 --> 00:25:16,163
No. No one went by us.

341
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:19,076
Detectives, we found these.

342
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:21,460
Gloves, masks, vests.

343
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:29,360
We let them walk right past us.

344
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:34,240
Fucking beautiful.

345
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:54,051
Okay, we-- We got the one teller dead.

346
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,930
The two that were strung up, they're alive, but they're in critical condition.

347
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:01,475
Few of the SWAT took burns, but that's the worst of it.

348
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:05,354
Depending on who you talk to, there was between five and nine perps.

349
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:08,065
Nobody saw them, because they were wearing their masks.

350
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,359
I got Dax collecting all the security tapes...

351
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:13,946
...so that's at least gonna give us a firm number.

352
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,699
Want background checks on every hostage.

353
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:19,493
They're all suspects until they're not.

354
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:21,662
-Excuse me.
-Yeah?

355
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,623
I need to hear that conversation between Conners and Lorenz.

356
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,500
-Well, you'll have to wait.
-How long?

357
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,710
An hour, maybe more.

358
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:30,170
Can you show me how to play it myself?

359
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:32,715
Now, look, it doesn't work this way, okay?

360
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:34,300
I don't take orders from you.

361
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,927
I don't know you and no one touches my stuff, okay?

362
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,638
You'll have to wait. Excuse me.

363
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,099
What the--?

364
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,351
What the hell are you doing?
Are you ADD?

365
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,688
Along with whatever they stole and this war zone they left behind...

366
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:50,107
...a man's dead and the killers are running free.

367
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,551
I don't have time to wait.

368
00:26:51,577 --> 00:26:52,926
I'll figure it out myself.

369
00:26:52,952 --> 00:26:54,178
Thank you for your help.

370
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,627
Okay, wait. No.

371
00:26:55,653 --> 00:26:57,306
Just-- No, no, no.

372
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,508
This is a dat recorder.

373
00:26:58,534 --> 00:26:59,595
You know what that is?

374
00:26:59,621 --> 00:27:00,584
Digital audio-tape.

375
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,706
It's just like a regular tape player, right?

376
00:27:02,732 --> 00:27:03,687
Play, stop, rewind.

377
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:07,207
The headphones jack straight in.

378
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,585
Tape's already inside.
All right?

379
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:12,004
That wasn't so hard, was it?

380
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:17,176
Just don't break anything, okay?

381
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:40,324
So everyone's been cleared out at this point except for those two there.

382
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,575
What about this one?

383
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,078
That's a camera in the vault.

384
00:27:43,104 --> 00:27:44,853
It got blown in the first explosion.

385
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:48,832
And here comes....

386
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:51,669
That's when you cut the power.

387
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,837
So we can't ID them.

388
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,924
There's a four minute, 52-second gap before the image returns.

389
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,884
Yeah. They're long gone by then.

390
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:01,001
Go to the tapes when they went in.

391
00:28:01,027 --> 00:28:02,287
Document each move made...

392
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,264
...for the two hours they were inside.

393
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,393
Oh, hey.
Awful lot of news cameras outside.

394
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,270
Maybe one got a good look at them coming out.

395
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:12,189
Have Vincent check it out.

396
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:16,193
Conners, better come out here.

397
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,448
Oh, shit.

398
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:22,908
Feds.

399
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,370
Detective Conners.

400
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,955
Join us, would you?

401
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,289
Someone's dead?

402
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:33,669
Theory put to practice isn't always perfect.

403
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:36,130
You can't expect to keep the hostages in check...

404
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:38,132
...if you let a bad deed go unpunished.

405
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:41,135
They might just randomly revolt.

406
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:44,138
Chaos has some order to it.

407
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:52,604
Prince Amar Al-Aban is one of the wealthiest and least popular Arabs...

408
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,142
...in the Middle East.

409
00:28:54,168 --> 00:28:57,217
There's been threats, but for better or worse...

410
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,153
...he's an ally to the United States.

411
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,196
Last month in Charlotte, North Carolina...

412
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:03,157
...the Crown Valley Bank was hit.

413
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:05,200
Prince had a safe-deposit box there too.

414
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:06,669
So, what was in the box?

415
00:29:06,695 --> 00:29:08,103
We don't keep records.

416
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,913
Boxes are private.

417
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:13,500
Since 9/11, we screen for live tissue, viruses and explosives.

418
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:15,627
If it passes those tests, we don't ask.

419
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:18,547
Look, this is fascinating shit.

420
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,174
What about the money?

421
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,426
Bank robbers still like cash, don't they?

422
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,803
Cash drawers don't appear to be touched.

423
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:26,263
Neither does the cash vault.

424
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,849
So they broke into a bank and didn't steal any money?

425
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,028
We believe the prince's box was the target.

426
00:29:31,054 --> 00:29:32,503
We're trying to reach him now.

427
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:34,980
Sir, may I have a word with you, please?

428
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,316
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

429
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,784
I'm curious.

430
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:53,207
Are you familiar with the term "franchise-sized fuckup"?

431
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:55,793
What, this is my fault, huh?

432
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:59,546
I'm beginning to understand why they wanted to deal directly with you.

433
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:04,468
You think you're smart, Quentin, but, man, are you stupid.

434
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,595
-You got played.
-Oh, that's not fair.

435
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:09,306
Everything was according to standard procedure.

436
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,231
You came to me.

437
00:30:10,257 --> 00:30:11,416
I didn't ask for this.

438
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:14,478
The commissioner's office is scrambling to make sense of this.

439
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:19,733
If they need a scapegoat, I got zero problem serving you up.

440
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,026
Thought so.

441
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:23,111
You wanted this to happen.

442
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,906
Good God, I did not.

443
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:30,619
If it had to be somebody....

444
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:37,000
Theory put to practice isn't always perfect.

445
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,419
You can't expect to keep the hostages in check...

446
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:41,421
...if you let a bad deed go unpunished.

447
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:44,466
They might just randomly revolt.

448
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:48,762
Chaos has some order to it.

489
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:07,030
I think this Lorenz was trying to tell us something.

490
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,867
Oh, really?
You don't say.

491
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,537
The way he spoke.

492
00:31:11,563 --> 00:31:14,479
He paused before certain words.

493
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:16,874
Have you ever heard of the chaos theory?

494
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:20,669
Edward Lorenz invented the chaos theory in the 1960s.

495
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:23,130
It's the study of phenomena that appear random...

496
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:25,132
...but have an element of regularity...

497
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,384
...which can be described mathematically.

498
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,969
Try that again.

499
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:33,807
Pretty much, initial state of events may seem unrelated and random...

500
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,767
...but eventually a pattern emerges...

501
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:38,812
...and in the end, all the pieces fit together.

502
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,814
Anything else, officers?

503
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,358
No, that'll be all.
Thanks.

504
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:46,445
So you're a college boy.

505
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:47,696
Which one?

506
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,156
Someplace I've heard of...

507
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:53,160
...or one of those inbred state schools no one's heard of?

508
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,328
U. Dub.

509
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:57,247
So it's the latter.

510
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,541
How'd you end up on the force?

511
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,543
It's kind of the family business.

512
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,962
Oh, your dad's dad and so on back?

513
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,924
Listen, do we really need all this "get to know you" crap?

514
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,092
Couple of hours ago, you didn't give a shit.

515
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,677
You've grown on me.

516
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:14,306
Besides, I'm entrusting my life to you. I should know something about you.

517
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,808
I would think you'd like to know a little about me.

518
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:19,728
I know about you, detective.
Everyone does.

519
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,272
You don't say that with much enthusiasm.

520
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:26,234
Not much to be enthusiastic about.

521
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:29,029
Listen, my reputation often precedes me.

522
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:34,159
You, however, have no reputation at all, a fact I need to deal with.

523
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:37,663
If you've been through the shit I have, then you can judge me.

524
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:41,291
Now, we can try to work together and make the best of a bad situation...

525
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:44,544
...or we can compare dick sizes all day.

526
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:46,046
It's up to you.

527
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:50,884
Since this is your first day here, today, mine's bigger.

528
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,638
Conners, come in.

529
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:57,349
Go ahead.

530
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:00,143
I got something you're gonna wanna see.

531
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,565
Lastly, I don't like the Pac 10.

532
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:07,985
It's overrated.

533
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:25,752
Come over and see this.

534
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,589
Detective.
Just can't stay away from me, can you?

535
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,591
Can you roll, please?

536
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,761
Yeah, Okay.
Right there. Perfect.

537
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,847
Damon Richards.

538
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,433
Career loser.
I busted him a couple years ago...

539
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,916
...on attempted robbery.

540
00:33:40,942 --> 00:33:42,586
Stupid bastard never learns.

541
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,563
What's he doing back on the streets?

542
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:47,107
He gave up his partners and cut a deal with the D.A.

543
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,358
Got an address?

544
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:51,403
The only thing on file's in Spokane, but I think I remember...

545
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:54,114
...that he had a girlfriend in town.
Gina, I think.

546
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,303
Gina, it's the police.

547
00:34:01,329 --> 00:34:02,272
Open up.

548
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,087
Step back. 
Now.

549
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,828
Gun!

550
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:44,929
Shots fired. 
Officer down.

551
00:34:44,955 --> 00:34:46,608
We need an ambulance and backup.

552
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,670
Oh, shit.

553
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:52,964
Are you hit?

554
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,341
I'm fine.

555
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:23,703
I got her.

556
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:25,914
I got her. 
Stop, Gina.

557
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,124
Teddy!

558
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,459
-You like that, huh?
-Yeah.

559
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,781
I'm a police officer.

560
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:03,307
That guy's a murder suspect.

561
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:04,394
I need your bike.

562
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,745
What?

563
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,287
Go ahead, dude.

564
00:36:08,313 --> 00:36:09,941
It's all yours, man.

565
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:38,403
Look out!

566
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:21,404
Son of a bitch.

567
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,874
I want my fucking lawyer.

568
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,542
Fuck your lawyer.

569
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,536
He's unconscious but stable, with a nice knot on his forehead.

570
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,373
Three officers are watching the room.

571
00:39:35,399 --> 00:39:36,481
He wakes, they call.

572
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,248
Hey, Quincy, come on.

573
00:39:38,274 --> 00:39:39,526
Give it a rest.

574
00:39:39,552 --> 00:39:40,385
I'm fine.

575
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,796
Quincy was a coroner.

576
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:45,715
You might be bruised, but you may have a cracked rib.

577
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,217
You should get to a hospital.

578
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,302
Should do a lot of things.

579
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,558
You sure you're all right?

580
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,268
I'm fine.

581
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:02,565
Gina Lopez, 28, done time for possession, has two kids.

582
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:03,775
Am I interrupting?

583
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,487
No.

584
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,239
Excuse me.

585
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,283
Gina claims she doesn't know anything about a bank robbery.

586
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:14,077
Of course she doesn't.

587
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,704
-Vincent.
-Yeah?

588
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:19,833
Have them put Miss Lopez...

589
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,293
...in interrogation one and turn the AC on full.

590
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:24,629
Let me know when her nipples can cut glass.

591
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,089
Sorry, detective. 
I didn't--

592
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,591
When we first met, I didn't realize who you were.

593
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:32,846
I worked with your dad briefly right after I got out of the academy.

594
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:34,431
It was an honor.

595
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:35,849
Thanks, Vincent.

596
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,559
Father was Harry Dekker.

597
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,853
Detectives, ready for you.

598
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:48,528
Somebody going on a trip?

599
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,822
Looks like it, don't it?

600
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,866
You're looking well, Marnie.

601
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:54,753
Heard you were back, Conners.

602
00:40:54,779 --> 00:40:55,727
Keep dreaming.

603
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,872
You, on the other hand:

604
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:01,833
-Hi. Marnie.
-Shane.

605
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:04,206
You know, I got a bike myself.

606
00:41:04,232 --> 00:41:06,362
Maybe we can go for a ride.

607
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:07,964
Or maybe I could just ride you.

608
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:13,094
Can we get back to work now, please?

609
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:18,433
We have passport, suntan lotion, Bermuda shorts, thong bikini--

610
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,143
Hopefully hers.

611
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:24,230
--and this.

612
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:31,196
Must be 50 large, his cut.

613
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:34,032
-You'd think, right?
-It's not?

614
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:38,578
Well, don't put words in my mouth, but two things jump out at me here.

615
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:41,164
First of all, every bank has their own money bands...

616
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,082
...and these are not American Global's.

617
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,252
After checking, we find they belong to World National Financial.

618
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,214
-Sounds familiar.
 -Months ago, half a million dollars...

619
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:52,550
...was stolen in an armed robbery there, smash-and-grab job.

620
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:53,891
But they caught the guys.

621
00:41:53,917 --> 00:41:55,370
They recovered about 400,000.

622
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:59,641
Now, they've been in jail ever since and their trials are still pending...

623
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:03,937
...so that brings me to point number two.

624
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,023
Smell that.

625
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:10,235
-What is that?
-When evidence comes in...

626
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:13,071
...any physical contact can make it hard to lift prints...

627
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,614
...so now to mark the bills...

628
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:17,116
...we spray a scented solution directly on them.

629
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:19,786
-Is that new?
-Yeah. Wave of the future.

630
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:22,747
You try and keep up with the times, eh, Conners?

631
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:25,166
So this money's not from our bank.

632
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:28,419
Oh, no. 
No, this money's from the World National Financial job...

633
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:30,255
...and our evidence room.

634
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:40,139
For a list of things you can put in my mouth.

635
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:41,975
Conners.

636
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:50,650
Do you remember who headed up the World National case?

637
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:53,820
I think it was Callo.

638
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,154
Why?

639
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:58,491
Oh, no reason.
Just thinking out loud. Come on.

640
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:06,708
When you said it was your family business, I didn't realize.

641
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:09,377
Guess I just didn't connect the dots.

642
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:12,463
Don't worry about it.

643
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:14,841
Your father was a hero.

644
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,428
Yes, he was.

645
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:25,101
First I thought maybe you were related to the captain.

646
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:29,272
No. No relation.

647
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,331
We found the money, Gina.

648
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,042
The money was Damon's.

649
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:51,419
That money came from our evidence room.

650
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:54,213
I told you, I know nothing about a bank robbery.

651
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:58,134
Whatever Damon was into, I know nothing about.

652
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,595
So where were you going?

653
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:02,055
Vacation.

654
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:04,932
This isn't possession or solicitation, Gina.

655
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,643
This is felony murder one.

656
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,562
If you're protecting him, you'd get life.

657
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,147
I didn't do nothing.

658
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,690
It's "I didn't do anything."

659
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:16,986
"Didn't do nothing" is a double negative, infers the positive.

660
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:19,572
The grammar in this country's terrible.

661
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,006
Look, this isn't going away.

662
00:44:21,032 --> 00:44:22,433
You wanna walk out of here...

663
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:25,161
...with some semblance of a life, you tell me something.

664
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,783
I'm done talking.

665
00:44:26,809 --> 00:44:28,690
I want a lawyer now.

666
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:33,711
Fine. Then it's two phone calls I'll make.

667
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:36,089
The first to the public defender's office.

668
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:38,257
The second will be to children's services.

669
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:41,094
What?

670
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:44,180
Simple.
 You insist on a lawyer, I'll take your kids.

671
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:45,157
Wait.

672
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:48,418
You can't take my kids away from me.

673
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,461
What do you care?

674
00:44:49,487 --> 00:44:52,296
You were ready to fly the coop with shit-for-brains.

675
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:54,482
Fuck you!
You can't treat me like this!

676
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:55,817
I have rights, you know.

677
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:57,819
You can't take my children away from me!

678
00:44:57,986 --> 00:44:59,570
I can and I will.

679
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:01,614
Just tell me what I wanna know.

680
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,551
Not exactly useful information.

681
00:45:09,577 --> 00:45:10,982
You believe her?

682
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:14,419
I think for the first time in the girl's life, she's telling the truth.

683
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:17,004
Once she asked for a lawyer anything she told us...

684
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:19,298
...would have been inadmissible.

685
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:20,790
Yeah? Who would've known?

686
00:45:20,816 --> 00:45:22,827
Would've been her word against mine.

687
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:26,139
And who do you think the jury would have believed?

688
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:29,434
Justice by any means, even if you cross the line?

689
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:32,228
The only line around here is the blue line.

690
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,981
You cross that one, then you got problems.

691
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:37,817
Ask Callo. He knows what I'm talking about.

692
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:41,195
Those serial numbers Marnie faxed me...

693
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:44,323
...according to our computers, that money should be downstairs.

694
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:46,659
Moving on to basketball...

695
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:51,664
...Sonics defeated the Trailblazers last night, 85 to 72.

696
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:57,545
Buzz us in.

697
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:03,593
Gotta sign first.

698
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:15,062
Heard you were back.

699
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:17,899
Kind of liked not having you around, Conners.

700
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:20,193
Have another doughnut, Harry.

701
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:36,375
That fat fuck is the sole guardian of the city's greatest source of contraband.

702
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,628
Drugs, weapons, cash.

703
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:42,507
Millions just sitting here for the taking.

704
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:45,051
Yeah, but you'd have to have some major firepower...

705
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:49,555
...not to mention an extra-large set of balls to knock off the police station.

706
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:52,058
Not if you're a cop.

707
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:56,729
Could just walk right in and...

708
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,233
...take whatever you want.

709
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:09,200
Here it is. Line 17.

710
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:11,077
Bernie Callo.

711
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:14,080
No one takes anything out of here unless they sign for it.

712
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:16,082
So, what?
He showed you a warrant, what?

713
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,750
He must've.

714
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:19,001
He must've.

715
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:21,045
What, lost your fucking memory, Harry?

716
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:23,715
You know how many times someone signs shit out?

717
00:47:23,741 --> 00:47:24,782
I see the same guys.

718
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:27,593
I can't remember one instance from two weeks ago.

719
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:30,763
If that's his signature, that means he signed for it.

720
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,431
Take it up with him.

721
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:37,687
The money from Richards' place traced to the World National heist...

722
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,564
...a case Callo headed up.

723
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:42,942
Bernie signed the money out of evidence himself two weeks ago.

724
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,193
How much?

725
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,654
Four hundred and thirty-three thousand dollars...

726
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:49,824
If it is Callo, it would explain how they knew police protocol...

727
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,701
...and how our department operates.

728
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,786
Explains why he was pissed this morning...

729
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,580
...about being replaced by Conners.

730
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:57,915
He doesn't need another reason to be pissed.

731
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:00,459
What about motive?

732
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:02,753
-Do we have one?
-Pressure.

733
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:04,422
Could have been getting to him.

734
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,841
He's been getting a big cold shoulder from cops...

735
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,926
...since he testified about Pearl Street.

736
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:11,637
No. I don't buy that.

737
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:15,641
He was also getting divorced.

738
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:20,771
About a month ago, he told me he and his wife might be splitting...

739
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:23,774
...asked if I knew a lawyer who wouldn't clean him out.

740
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:26,152
I didn't think it was this serious.

741
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,195
I don't know. Bernie's a first-rate cop.

742
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:30,156
He was a boy scout, for chrissake.

743
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,450
This just doesn't make any sense, guys.

744
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:34,535
They never do, captain.

745
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:37,330
Come on.
The facts speak for themselves.

746
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:39,457
No, they don't.

747
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:41,459
Why, if Callo's involved--?

748
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:44,337
Why didn't they ask for him at the bank?

749
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,176
Jenkins.

750
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:04,231
And you arrived home at what time?

751
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:08,152
Mrs. Callo, do you feel okay to continue?

752
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,946
Yes, I'm fine.

753
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,115
Just a few more minutes.

754
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:21,082
Wife came home approximately 45 minutes ago, found him here.

755
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:23,209
None of the neighbors heard anything.

756
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:24,710
There was no forced entry...

757
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:27,171
...and no one saw anyone else fleeing the scene.

758
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:32,051
Guys, blueprints from the bank.

759
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:34,261
There's pictures, schematics.

760
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:37,807
There's at least a dozen Internet articles on the Saudi prince.

761
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,643
So that's it.

762
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:48,369
You've reached the Callo residence.

763
00:49:48,395 --> 00:49:49,760
No one can get to the phone.

764
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:52,029
Please leave a message.

765
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:54,365
Detective Conners.

766
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:59,578
Are you starting to connect the dots?

767
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:02,039
Putting all the pieces together?

768
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,545
Is the pattern starting to emerge?

769
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,925
They wouldn't punish you...

770
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,094
...but I will.

771
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:20,182
Vengeance will be mine, detective.

772
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:23,019
Then come and get me, you piece of shit.

773
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:52,298
What they told Callo was the plan and what the plan was...

774
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:54,300
...must have been two different things.

775
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:57,470
Obviously this wasn't part of a plan Callo would've agreed with.

776
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:59,472
You'd think a cop would be smarter.

777
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:01,265
Come on.
As cops, we come across...

778
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:03,928
...every temptation in the book.

779
00:51:03,954 --> 00:51:05,669
Money, drugs, power.

780
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:09,940
We all like to think we can resist any urge, but we're not saints.

781
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:13,319
So Callo was involved, and now they're dragging you into it.

782
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:16,489
-Why?
-Man said he wanted vengeance.

783
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:19,325
Piss anyone off lately?

784
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:21,827
Me?

785
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:24,663
So I just got off the phone with Agent Doyle...

786
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:27,249
...and apparently after the Charlotte break-in...

787
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:30,294
...the prince withdrew all his possessions...

788
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:33,339
...from every safe-deposit box in the country.

789
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:35,966
-They didn't touch the cash.
-No.

790
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:38,260
-Or the safe-deposit boxes.
-Nope.

791
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:43,849
So they break into a bank, blow it up, and steal nothing?

792
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:45,351
Still make sense to you?

793
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,853
Nothing about today makes sense.

794
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:49,522
Excuse me.

795
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:08,791
Return to the earth now...

796
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:12,628
...if your mind is troubled and your heart is uncertain...

797
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:17,383
...for it is by returning to the beginning that we can clearly see the path.

798
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:19,844
He's your find.

799
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:25,391
Detective, wanna say that again?

800
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,185
We go back to where this all started.

801
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:29,812
We go back to the bank.

802
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:44,702
The tapes are confirming five bad guys, but since the vault cam blew...

803
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:47,705
...what they did in there is a total mystery.

804
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:49,695
I've been through these tapes 20 times.

805
00:52:49,721 --> 00:52:50,608
I'm telling you--

806
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:52,251
Shut up, Dax.

807
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:13,725
Wait.
 Hold on a second.

808
00:53:13,751 --> 00:53:14,757
Do you see that?

809
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,776
-See what?
-Go back a little.

810
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:20,362
-What?
-Look closely at the camera angles.

811
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:21,653
They're all fixed, right?

812
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:22,890
They don't rotate or pan.

813
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,241
Okay, play it.

814
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:27,286
Now, Camera 8 dominates our attention because of the explosion.

815
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:29,788
But while that's happening, check out Camera 2.

816
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,459
Where are you going?

817
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:37,046
Changed the angle.

818
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:38,797
Watched it 20 times, eh, Dax?

819
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:42,134
What's in that corner they don't want us to see?

820
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:46,639
So are you at all concerned there's some wacko trying to get you?

821
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:51,644
If I worried about every threat made against me,
 I'd never leave the house.

822
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:54,647
Watch your eyes.

823
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:00,986
Lots of prints here.

824
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:01,909
Check them all.

825
00:54:01,935 --> 00:54:03,847
Anyone's got a record, I want an ID.

826
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:05,491
You got it.

827
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:07,952
-Dax.
-Yes, sir?

828
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:11,705
You hack into this?

829
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:15,668
Hack into a nationwide bank security system?

830
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:18,379
Yeah, I'd love to.

831
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:20,172
Hang on. Hang on.

832
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:22,174
So, what do we do in the meantime?

833
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:24,343
Do you like Italian?

834
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:37,606
As if we didn't get in the way.

835
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:39,108
You never know with you guys.

836
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,610
What was that thing you were saying at the house...

837
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:45,364
...about returning to the beginning path or something?

838
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:47,825
Yeah, it's a Buddha story.

839
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:49,743
We're all ears.

840
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:58,544
One day, the Buddha found his heart in turmoil...

841
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:01,213
...so he retreats to the forest, to the earth...

842
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:03,590
...to the base of a great tree.

843
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:06,385
And I'm paraphrasing...

844
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:08,846
...but this elephant comes up and tells Buddha...

845
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:11,348
...he doesn't like seeing him discouraged, and....

846
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:13,767
He can talk to an elephant?

847
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:14,675
He's the Buddha.

848
00:55:14,701 --> 00:55:16,920
He's attained the sixth level of consciousness.

849
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:22,526
He's capable of communicating with plants, trees, even rocks.

850
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,070
Rocks.

851
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:30,743
-You asked.
-Come on, guys. Please. Continue.

852
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,009
The Buddha was troubled.

853
00:55:32,035 --> 00:55:33,270
He goes to the beginning.

854
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:39,126
He goes back to where he came from to find the path, the answer.

855
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:41,128
So when you hit a dead end...

856
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:43,380
...go back to the beginning to find your way.

857
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:45,966
Or something like that.

858
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,430
We have a genuine philosopher in our midst.

859
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,974
Are you--?
Are you a Buddhist?

860
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:56,226
No. Just something I picked up along the way.

861
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:59,104
But you're religious?

862
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:01,190
Not particularly.

863
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:04,943
Excuse me.

864
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:12,267
You guys are all pretty tight?

865
00:56:12,293 --> 00:56:14,436
We've been through a lot together.

866
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:16,663
-Yeah.
-I guess I just thought--

867
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:17,883
I don't know.

868
00:56:17,909 --> 00:56:20,984
With him being in so much trouble...

869
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:24,838
...coming back from the suspension, everyone might treat him differently.

870
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:27,716
You can't really believe what you read or see on TV.

871
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:30,636
I mean, if anything, our tie to Quentin's gotten stronger.

872
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:32,679
Even when things got pretty wild today...

873
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:35,140
...and everybody else panicked, he was in control.

874
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:36,834
Now, that just doesn't happen.

875
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,335
He's just-- He's that good.

876
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:40,437
Excuse me.

877
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:51,657
What are you doing?

878
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,826
I realized something today.

879
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:58,163
Being around you, all that's happened, I can't--

880
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:02,209
I think I made a mistake.

881
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:03,836
It's too late.

882
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:06,588
You made your choice.

883
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:08,257
Now live with it.

884
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,552
They got a match.

885
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:12,691
Got a name?

886
00:57:12,717 --> 00:57:13,954
Chris Lei.

887
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:17,516
Prick used to work for some big-time software company...

888
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:20,352
...till they caught him pirating programs.

889
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,855
Couple of years later, he was busted for hacking...

890
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:25,441
...into the pension plans of retired cops.

891
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,860
I'd say for a genius, he's a fucking moron.

892
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:31,405
This was your case, you and York.

893
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:32,379
You made the bust.

894
00:57:32,405 --> 00:57:33,390
Why didn't it stick?

895
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:35,826
We were in the middle of the Pearl Street fallout.

896
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:38,912
His lawyer put us on trial, said we were crooked, abusive...

897
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,706
...and that we planted evidence.

898
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:42,040
Jury bought it.

899
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:43,542
Was it true?

900
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:44,953
The guy was guilty.

901
00:57:44,979 --> 00:57:45,803
He was scum.

902
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:47,070
That's the truth.

903
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:49,756
There's something they don't teach you.

904
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:53,385
The system breaks down, you have to compensate to get results.

905
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:55,721
That gives you the right to break the rules?

906
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:58,724
Bend, not break.

907
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:00,893
It means justice absolutely.

908
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:05,522
Another thing they don't teach you.

909
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:23,665
Come on.

910
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,501
Come on.

911
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:35,594
Shit.

912
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:45,229
Fare thee well, Chris.

-You okay?
-Yeah.

954
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:06,495
Shit.

955
01:01:15,421 --> 01:01:16,963
That should do it.

956
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:19,132
You can put your shirt back on.

957
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:23,754
Look at that.

958
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:26,248
First day in the city, and you've already been shot.

959
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:27,766
Just grazed him.

960
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:30,602
Why don't I just graze you with a bullet, see how you feel?

961
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:32,938
Hey, Damon Richards's awake.

962
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:46,868
Take five, guys.

963
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:51,957
Hey, Damon.

964
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:54,126
How you feeling?

965
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:57,295
What? No flowers for me?

966
01:01:57,463 --> 01:02:00,048
We got you dead to rights on murder and armed robbery...

967
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:01,842
...and you're there cracking jokes.

968
01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:05,470
-You fucking idiot.
-Fuck yourself.

969
01:02:07,306 --> 01:02:09,975
Detective.

970
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:13,019
May I?

971
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:21,987
You remember me, don't you, Damon?

972
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:28,618
Thought so.

973
01:02:28,786 --> 01:02:30,662
Now, we're only gonna give you one chance.

974
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:33,790
One chance to tell us what we need to know and help yourself.

975
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:35,000
Really?

976
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:37,419
Just one chance?

977
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:47,137
I was skiing about three years ago in Aspen.

978
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:49,222
Beautiful country.

979
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:51,433
You ever been, Damon?

980
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:54,936
Never mind.

981
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:58,607
I hit a mogul...

982
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:02,360
...landed on a sheet of ice, and slammed into a tree.

983
01:03:02,528 --> 01:03:07,199
Broke myself up pretty bad, kind of like you did today.

984
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:10,118
I was in a hospital bed for three months.

985
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:14,122
Had it not been for--

986
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:17,709
Here it is, morphine.

987
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:20,962
Without this stuff, I wouldn't have made it.

988
01:03:32,725 --> 01:03:36,061
This I.V. drip administers a small dosage every minute or so...

989
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:42,692
...makes you feel nice and relaxed, calm, no pain...

990
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:45,195
...but...

991
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:51,576
...if I were to inject this whole thing, that'd be all she wrote for Damon.

992
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:05,757
This equipment malfunctions all the time, Damon.

993
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:07,444
Overdoses are quite common.

994
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:09,494
Besides, I don't think the DA's...

995
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:12,597
...gonna launch a full-scale investigation over a scum like you.

996
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:25,235
You don't have to tell us anything.

997
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:27,737
Plead the fifth.

998
01:04:27,905 --> 01:04:29,531
Roll the dice.

999
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:35,287
Okay. Okay. I'll talk.

1000
01:04:35,454 --> 01:04:37,998
You're a fucking hypocrite.

1001
01:04:38,165 --> 01:04:40,542
Question my interrogation skills?

1002
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:43,295
At least I don't threaten them with a lethal overdose.

1003
01:04:43,462 --> 01:04:46,131
There's never been a case in recorded medical history...

1004
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:50,010
...of someone overdosing on 5 ccs of saline.

1005
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:53,972
Bend, not break.

1006
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:56,641
That's what you said, right?

1007
01:05:03,524 --> 01:05:08,403
Damon Richards testifies that Lorenz's true identity is Scott Curtis.

1008
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:11,364
He's wanted in connection with three other bank robberies...

1009
01:05:11,532 --> 01:05:13,408
...extortion and kidnapping.

1010
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:15,619
He's also the brother of John Curtis...

1011
01:05:15,786 --> 01:05:19,456
...the perp Conners shot on the Pearl Street Bridge.

1012
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:21,499
We have the names of two accomplices...

1013
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:23,793
...Lamar Galt and Xander Harrington.

1014
01:05:23,961 --> 01:05:27,005
Everybody was supposed to meet up tonight at 10...

1015
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:28,840
...and we have that address.

1016
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:32,052
Now, after finding Callo and Lei dead today...

1017
01:05:32,219 --> 01:05:35,555
...doesn't take a rocket surgeon to figure that Curtis is eliminating...

1018
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:37,349
...his accomplices one by one.

1019
01:05:37,516 --> 01:05:40,143
Doesn't matter what he told Galt and Harrington.

1020
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:42,604
He's planning on finishing them off tonight.

1021
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:50,153
Never think of the repercussions.

1022
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:57,410
Suspect's mother, father, brother.

1023
01:05:57,578 --> 01:05:59,537
How your decision affects them.

1024
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:06,378
Had murder in his eyes.

1025
01:06:06,545 --> 01:06:08,546
John Curtis?

1026
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:12,050
It was pouring, lights everywhere.

1027
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:15,887
If he had only done what I said:

1028
01:06:16,055 --> 01:06:17,514
"Drop the weapon."

1029
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:24,980
But it was not to be.

1030
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:30,068
My dad died when I was 12.

1031
01:06:31,195 --> 01:06:34,072
He walked into a liquor store in the middle of a holdup.

1032
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,449
Guy just opened fire.

1033
01:06:36,617 --> 01:06:39,953
He didn't even have time to react.

1034
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:42,580
They said he was a hero.

1035
01:06:42,748 --> 01:06:45,834
Know what that means to a 12-year-old?

1036
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:48,086
Because he dies on the job, he's a hero?

1037
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:49,671
Never made sense to me.

1038
01:06:50,631 --> 01:06:52,382
So why become a cop?

1039
01:06:54,093 --> 01:06:56,011
Finish what he started.

1040
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:58,555
Every day, he went out trying to do some good...

1041
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:02,350
...tried to help the people who couldn't help themselves.

1042
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:07,105
"Just give them a chance," is what he always said.

1043
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:10,108
Didn't always work out, but he tried.

1044
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:14,863
You tried to help save that girl on the bridge.

1045
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:17,449
If you weren't there, the girl still would've died.

1046
01:07:43,642 --> 01:07:45,643
-How long we gonna sit here?
-I don't know.

1047
01:07:45,811 --> 01:07:47,937
Come on.

1048
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:50,523
It's 25 after.

1049
01:07:50,691 --> 01:07:53,068
How much longer we waiting?

1050
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:56,154
We go now, all we get is Galt and Harrington.

1051
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:57,363
Want Curtis.

1052
01:07:57,531 --> 01:07:59,824
Now relax and keep the line free.

1053
01:08:00,826 --> 01:08:02,869
Fucking prick's driving me mad.

1054
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:12,670
Shit.

1055
01:08:12,838 --> 01:08:16,007
-What?
-I'm out of gum.

1056
01:08:19,053 --> 01:08:21,244
Look, man, call him. 
Okay? Fuck this.

1057
01:08:21,270 --> 01:08:23,164
Shut the fuck up, all right?

1058
01:08:23,307 --> 01:08:25,767
I'm not sitting around here all fucking day, man.

1059
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:27,127
We can't let him walk.

1060
01:08:27,153 --> 01:08:28,128
We gotta go now.

1061
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:31,898
No. Stand down.

1062
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:36,277
We bust him now, we got something.

1063
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:38,530
We let him get in that car, we got jack squat.

1064
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:43,201
We got three cars and uniform backup in all directions.

1065
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:45,995
If they ride, we'll reel them in.

1066
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:48,873
I want Curtis.

1067
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:53,086
Nobody goes into the house until I say.

1068
01:08:57,341 --> 01:08:58,758
He ain't answering.

1069
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:04,389
Gotta be fucking out here.

1070
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:07,058
-Turn it off.
-Shit!

1071
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:18,069
Trigger-happy sons of bitches.

1072
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:24,469
All units, shots fired! 
Officer down!

1073
01:09:24,495 --> 01:09:25,518
Send an ambulance!

1074
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:26,995
Take them alive.

1075
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:28,830
-Take the back, Shane.
-Got it.

1076
01:10:08,078 --> 01:10:09,954
Teddy.

1077
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:43,738
Oh, my God.

1078
01:11:15,187 --> 01:11:17,146
Jesus.

1079
01:11:25,739 --> 01:11:27,615
Drop the gun.

1080
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:29,826
Last warning.

1081
01:12:07,406 --> 01:12:08,656
Get out of the house!

1082
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:10,241
Get out of the house now!

1083
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:16,289
Get down!

1084
01:12:37,811 --> 01:12:40,021
Hey, where's Conners?

1085
01:13:27,319 --> 01:13:29,570
Back up that line.

1086
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:34,784
Little more?

1087
01:13:34,952 --> 01:13:36,327
-Okay.
-Need more morphine?

1088
01:13:36,495 --> 01:13:38,079
No. Yeah.
Be great.

1089
01:13:38,105 --> 01:13:39,021
Thank you.

1090
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:48,131
Get that entrance in the back.

1091
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:56,180
Check it out.

1092
01:14:03,897 --> 01:14:06,691
It's just-- It's--
 It's hard to take.

1093
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:11,654
I mean, you know, if it had to happen to somebody, well....

1094
01:14:12,656 --> 01:14:15,700
Oh, you son of a bitch.

1095
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:17,952
Teddy?

1096
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,455
You've always been jealous of him, Martin.

1097
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:23,875
Jealous?

1098
01:14:24,042 --> 01:14:28,379
It's because he wasn't just a better cop, he was a better man.

1099
01:14:29,214 --> 01:14:30,965
Detective, go home.

1100
01:14:40,434 --> 01:14:42,226
Is there something you wanna say?

1101
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:45,229
No, sir.

1102
01:14:45,397 --> 01:14:47,315
She said it perfectly.

1103
01:14:55,949 --> 01:14:58,075
You okay?

1104
01:14:58,243 --> 01:14:59,869
Conners was right.

1105
01:15:00,037 --> 01:15:02,747
We should've never gone in.

1106
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:04,790
How fucking dumb are we?

1107
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:34,946
Detective.

1108
01:15:35,989 --> 01:15:38,616
I know what they were doing inside the bank.

1109
01:15:38,784 --> 01:15:40,868
Here's a record of transactions from the bank.

1110
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:45,248
An average day produces about 3- or 400 pages, give or take.

1111
01:15:45,415 --> 01:15:49,293
Today there were over 3000 pages.

1112
01:15:49,461 --> 01:15:50,461
Meaning?

1113
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:53,339
We've just witnessed the largest bank heist in history...

1114
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:54,799
...about a billion dollars.

1115
01:15:56,051 --> 01:15:57,134
Come again?

1116
01:15:57,302 --> 01:15:58,803
They planted a computer virus.

1117
01:15:58,971 --> 01:16:01,347
It randomly withdraws money from all the accounts...

1118
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:03,933
...and deposits it into the bad guys' account.

1119
01:16:04,101 --> 01:16:07,728
Now, if you look at all the transactions, no two amounts are the same...

1120
01:16:07,896 --> 01:16:09,814
...and none of them are over $100.

1121
01:16:10,482 --> 01:16:14,151
You see, most security systems work on the size of the money...

1122
01:16:14,319 --> 01:16:15,987
...not the amount of transactions...

1123
01:16:16,154 --> 01:16:19,991
...so you wire out a million dollars from a handful of accounts...

1124
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:21,534
...red flags pop up...

1125
01:16:21,702 --> 01:16:26,330
...but wire out less than $100 from, say, 10 million accounts...

1126
01:16:26,498 --> 01:16:28,583
...no red flags.

1127
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:31,085
-Where's the money now?
-I don't know.

1128
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:32,920
What do you mean you don't know?

1129
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:35,965
Well, the virus set up a host of phantom accounts, right...

1130
01:16:36,133 --> 01:16:39,176
...where the money sits until it transfers to another account...

1131
01:16:39,344 --> 01:16:40,588
...and another and another.

1132
01:16:40,614 --> 01:16:42,455
It's never in one place long enough...

1133
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:44,104
...to get an accurate fix on it.

1134
01:16:44,130 --> 01:16:45,541
The money's moving around?

1135
01:16:45,684 --> 01:16:48,060
Yeah. Any withdrawal or deposit from any bank...

1136
01:16:48,228 --> 01:16:51,022
...doesn't normally go through till the next business day...

1137
01:16:51,189 --> 01:16:55,359
...so all these are just gonna float around till 9 a.m. tomorrow.

1138
01:16:55,527 --> 01:16:58,029
-Or 6 a.m. Pacific time.
-Sure.

1139
01:16:58,196 --> 01:17:00,239
Sunrise.

1140
01:17:00,407 --> 01:17:01,158
Why break in?

1141
01:17:01,184 --> 01:17:04,185
If they're wiring money, couldn't they do that from anywhere?

1142
01:17:04,328 --> 01:17:07,872
No. See, that's the regional manager's computer terminal.

1143
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:11,125
From there, you have unlimited entry into the bank's mainframe...

1144
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:14,170
...so there's no more working around passwords, no hacking in.

1145
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:16,714
It's straight in, nice and clean.

1146
01:17:17,758 --> 01:17:20,885
A billion dollars is missing, and we're only discovering this now?

1147
01:17:21,053 --> 01:17:23,220
Ironically, when you guys shut off the power...

1148
01:17:23,388 --> 01:17:26,766
...it helped hide the virus and bought it time to work.

1149
01:17:28,685 --> 01:17:32,355
They weren't trying to make it look like they were robbing to rip off a prince.

1150
01:17:32,522 --> 01:17:36,567
They were making it look like they ripped off a prince to rob a bank.

1151
01:17:36,735 --> 01:17:38,903
Chaos theory.

1152
01:17:40,113 --> 01:17:41,405
What you gonna do now?

1153
01:17:44,117 --> 01:17:46,452
I think this is beyond our jurisdiction.

1154
01:17:55,587 --> 01:17:57,838
-Hello.
-Detective, there's a call for you.

1155
01:17:58,006 --> 01:18:00,341
-Says it's urgent.
-Put it through.

1156
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:01,967
Good evening, detective.

1157
01:18:02,135 --> 01:18:04,428
My compliments on a fine day.

1158
01:18:04,596 --> 01:18:07,139
You are an unexpected and challenging adversary.

1159
01:18:07,307 --> 01:18:09,392
-It's not over yet.
-Wishful thinking.

1160
01:18:09,559 --> 01:18:11,852
No, my wish is to catch you.

1161
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,105
You're a murderer, a cop killer at that.

1162
01:18:14,272 --> 01:18:17,066
I didn't kill anyone who didn't deserve it.

1163
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:19,568
Callo was insignificant...

1164
01:18:19,736 --> 01:18:23,531
...and Conners, he deserved his fate.

1165
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:25,533
I know about the money.

1166
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:28,119
You steal a billion dollars, they will find you.

1167
01:18:28,286 --> 01:18:30,955
A risk I'm willing to take.

1168
01:18:59,943 --> 01:19:01,485
Sir.

1169
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:03,237
It doesn't add up.

1170
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:05,656
What doesn't add up, detective?

1171
01:19:05,824 --> 01:19:09,160
Why would he say Callo's insignificant?

1172
01:19:09,327 --> 01:19:10,453
Who?

1173
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:13,289
Lorenz.
 Curtis called me.

1174
01:19:14,082 --> 01:19:15,166
Really?

1175
01:19:15,333 --> 01:19:17,752
He said he didn't kill anyone who didn't deserve it.

1176
01:19:17,919 --> 01:19:20,129
He said Callo was insignificant, but he wasn't.

1177
01:19:20,297 --> 01:19:24,008
Without Callo, he doesn't have the knowledge of the department...

1178
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:27,303
...or the front money to hire the crew.

1179
01:19:27,804 --> 01:19:30,931
-Curtis called you?
-Yeah.

1180
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:33,476
Well, now he's screwing with your head.

1181
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:38,522
You did good today, Shane.

1182
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:41,066
Father would be very proud.

1183
01:19:42,861 --> 01:19:44,361
Get some sleep.

1184
01:19:44,529 --> 01:19:46,530
Be more bad guys for you tomorrow.

1185
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:29,334
I was in bed already.

1186
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,183
This couldn't wait till tomorrow?

1187
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:32,910
Sit down.

1188
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:39,873
How did he come after you?

1189
01:20:39,899 --> 01:20:41,986
It's the only thing that doesn't make sense.

1190
01:20:42,128 --> 01:20:43,671
What are you talking about?

1191
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:47,591
All day long, we thought Callo was the dirty cop.

1192
01:20:47,759 --> 01:20:49,760
All day long, we were wrong.

1193
01:20:51,638 --> 01:20:54,098
Here's the sign-out sheet from the evidence room.

1194
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:58,018
Here is one of Callo's reports.

1195
01:20:58,812 --> 01:21:00,396
Here's another one...

1196
01:21:00,564 --> 01:21:01,939
...and another one.

1197
01:21:04,818 --> 01:21:07,236
They're not the same signatures, Harry.

1198
01:21:07,404 --> 01:21:08,779
They're not even close.

1199
01:21:08,947 --> 01:21:11,907
Maybe he got a cramp in his hand.
I don't know.

1200
01:21:12,576 --> 01:21:13,617
Here's your file.

1201
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,829
You were reprimanded one month ago...

1202
01:21:16,997 --> 01:21:19,456
...when you confronted Callo outside the courthouse.

1203
01:21:19,624 --> 01:21:20,958
You punched him.

1204
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:22,388
That ring a bell?

1205
01:21:22,414 --> 01:21:24,194
And I'd do it again.

1206
01:21:24,337 --> 01:21:26,171
Cops who testify against cops...

1207
01:21:26,339 --> 01:21:28,924
...shouldn't be breathing the same air I do.

1208
01:21:29,092 --> 01:21:31,165
There's a line you don't cross.

1209
01:21:31,191 --> 01:21:32,661
So you set him up.

1210
01:21:32,804 --> 01:21:34,346
You forged Callo's signature...

1211
01:21:34,514 --> 01:21:37,141
...you gave him money and you helped him with his plan...

1212
01:21:37,309 --> 01:21:39,393
...because you thought he got the raw deal...

1213
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:41,270
...and don't deny it because I know!

1214
01:21:41,438 --> 01:21:43,814
Of course he got a raw deal at Pearl Street Bridge!

1215
01:21:43,982 --> 01:21:46,942
Everybody got a raw deal!

1216
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:50,905
You're helping a cop killer, Harry.

1217
01:21:51,823 --> 01:21:54,199
You're a year away from your pension.

1218
01:21:54,367 --> 01:21:56,397
Is this how you wanna go out?

1219
01:21:56,423 --> 01:21:58,312
My conscience is clean.

1220
01:22:06,254 --> 01:22:09,673
This has been a very long...

1221
01:22:10,508 --> 01:22:12,009
...day.

1222
01:22:15,847 --> 01:22:17,473
And I'm tired, Harry.

1223
01:22:20,477 --> 01:22:22,478
It's like we're chasing a phantom here.

1224
01:22:23,897 --> 01:22:26,857
Just when we have him...

1225
01:22:28,693 --> 01:22:30,194
...he disappears.

1226
01:22:31,738 --> 01:22:35,866
He's been two steps ahead of Conners and me all day.

1227
01:22:36,034 --> 01:22:37,284
Of course he has.

1228
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:39,578
Who knows Conners better than him?

1229
01:22:47,128 --> 01:22:49,922
How the hell does Curtis know Conners better than anyone?

1230
01:22:56,096 --> 01:22:58,222
We're not talking about Curtis, are we, Harry?

1231
01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:06,355
Who would know Conners better than anyone?

1232
01:23:10,902 --> 01:23:12,736
Who would you protect?

1233
01:23:15,782 --> 01:23:18,867
And who in your mind got the raw deal at Pearl Street Bridge?

1234
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:29,294
Drop the weapon!

1235
01:23:29,462 --> 01:23:31,296
One more step and the girl dies.

1236
01:23:33,508 --> 01:23:36,093
That you don't wanna do.

1237
01:23:41,433 --> 01:23:42,558
Think about it.

1238
01:23:42,726 --> 01:23:44,268
You kill her, where you gonna go?

1239
01:24:23,016 --> 01:24:25,350
It was York who was the dirty cop.

1240
01:24:25,518 --> 01:24:29,396
He assumed Scott Curtis' identity to throw us off the trail.

1241
01:24:33,485 --> 01:24:37,654
York plays his old partner, knowing all his moves.

1242
01:24:37,822 --> 01:24:39,865
Cut the power.

1243
01:24:40,033 --> 01:24:41,241
Now.

1244
01:24:45,455 --> 01:24:47,325
Frames his enemy for the crime.

1245
01:24:47,351 --> 01:24:48,315
Kills him too.

1246
01:24:49,876 --> 01:24:52,169
Look at this.
Blueprints from the bank.

1247
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:54,338
There's pictures, schematics.

1248
01:24:54,506 --> 01:24:57,591
There's at least a dozen Internet articles on the Saudi prince.

1249
01:24:57,759 --> 01:25:02,096
And pulls off one of the biggest robberies in history.

1250
01:25:04,182 --> 01:25:06,809
You do what you want to me.

1251
01:25:06,976 --> 01:25:10,604
He called me to tell me he's going and you ain't gonna find him.

1252
01:25:11,356 --> 01:25:13,232
Watch me.

1253
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:18,195
The number that York used to call Harry Hume is his cell phone number.

1254
01:25:18,363 --> 01:25:20,197
Ran it through all the service providers.

1255
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:21,289
Nextel got a match.

1256
01:25:21,315 --> 01:25:23,016
Can they get a location on him?

1257
01:25:23,159 --> 01:25:25,536
Should trace his location within 100 meters or less.

1258
01:25:25,703 --> 01:25:27,371
-Great.
-Oh, hang on.

1259
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:29,164
Hello.

1260
01:25:30,333 --> 01:25:33,001
Got him. Excellent. Thank you.

1261
01:26:10,415 --> 01:26:12,207
That'll be 8.48, please.

1262
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:17,254
Keep the change...

1263
01:26:17,422 --> 01:26:19,089
...doll face.

1264
01:26:19,257 --> 01:26:21,258
Thanks, mister.

1265
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:25,846
Jason York, this is the police.

1266
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:28,765
Put your hands in the air and get down on the ground slowly.

1267
01:26:28,933 --> 01:26:30,350
-Do it now.
-Don't shoot, okay?

1268
01:26:30,518 --> 01:26:32,436
Just be cool.
Okay.

1269
01:26:32,604 --> 01:26:34,438
Get down on the pavement.

1270
01:26:34,606 --> 01:26:36,106
You win.

1271
01:26:36,274 --> 01:26:39,234
Oh, Jesus.
Okay.

1272
01:26:39,402 --> 01:26:41,186
Get down on the pavement now.

1273
01:26:41,212 --> 01:26:43,180
Look, I'm cooperating, okay?

1274
01:26:43,323 --> 01:26:46,158
I give up.
Be cool, okay? All right?

1275
01:26:46,326 --> 01:26:47,823
You win.
I'm putting my hat down.

1276
01:26:47,849 --> 01:26:48,936
I didn't ask you to.

1277
01:26:49,078 --> 01:26:50,787
Put your hands where I can see them.

1278
01:26:50,955 --> 01:26:53,665
I said I give up, all right?

1279
01:26:53,833 --> 01:26:55,500
Final warning.

1280
01:26:58,922 --> 01:27:00,339
Take the back.

1281
01:27:09,641 --> 01:27:10,974
Was it Harry?

1282
01:27:11,142 --> 01:27:12,134
It was Harry, right?

1283
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:13,077
Oh, that fat fuck.

1284
01:27:13,103 --> 01:27:15,087
Drop the weapon and let the girl go.

1285
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:16,688
-It's over.
-Nope.

1286
01:27:16,856 --> 01:27:20,234
If you wanna bring me in, you gonna have to work for it.

1287
01:27:21,319 --> 01:27:22,653
That you don't wanna do.

1288
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:25,843
Well, isn't that interesting?

1289
01:27:25,869 --> 01:27:27,808
That's exactly what I said to him.

1290
01:27:29,077 --> 01:27:31,286
I mean, do you see the irony here?

1291
01:27:31,454 --> 01:27:32,079
You see it?

1292
01:27:32,105 --> 01:27:33,355
Or am I the only one?

1293
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:36,166
Two months ago I was in your shoes.

1294
01:27:36,793 --> 01:27:38,710
Yeah, standing there with some punk...

1295
01:27:38,878 --> 01:27:41,213
...holding a gun to an innocent girl's head...

1296
01:27:41,381 --> 01:27:44,675
...asking myself, "What should I do?"

1297
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:47,135
What would you do?

1298
01:27:48,304 --> 01:27:49,972
What would you do?

1299
01:27:50,556 --> 01:27:53,141
You'd do exactly what I did.

1300
01:27:53,309 --> 01:27:55,185
You'd try to make a difference.

1301
01:28:00,191 --> 01:28:01,358
Let's roll, baby.

1302
01:28:04,028 --> 01:28:05,862
Everybody out! 
Get out!

1303
01:28:06,030 --> 01:28:06,968
You all right?

1304
01:28:06,994 --> 01:28:08,265
Yeah. I'm fine.

1305
01:28:12,704 --> 01:28:14,371
Which way did he go?

1306
01:28:15,415 --> 01:28:17,833
He went towards the pier.

1307
01:28:39,897 --> 01:28:41,648
You really screwed yourself.

1308
01:28:42,442 --> 01:28:46,403
Jenkins is gonna expect these kind of results from you every day.

1309
01:28:57,040 --> 01:29:01,626
FBI's got a team of 40 technicians working on Lei's virus.

1310
01:29:01,794 --> 01:29:03,462
They'll break it.

1311
01:29:07,258 --> 01:29:09,134
Your conviction would be admirable.

1312
01:29:09,302 --> 01:29:10,844
It's just that it's so sad.

1313
01:29:37,246 --> 01:29:39,039
Get it through your head, man.

1314
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:41,333
The cavalry ain't coming.

1315
01:29:41,501 --> 01:29:44,169
No, no.
No hero's coming to save the day.

1316
01:29:44,337 --> 01:29:45,629
Oh, no.

1317
01:29:46,798 --> 01:29:49,800
The bad guy wins at the end of this story.

1318
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:55,680
But I have to admit, though.

1319
01:29:55,848 --> 01:29:59,309
You have turned out to be quite the little thorn.

1362
01:31:56,636 --> 01:31:58,345
Come on.

1363
01:32:05,686 --> 01:32:08,605
I have come too far to be denied.

1364
01:33:13,462 --> 01:33:19,009
We used to spend all day Sunday just reading in bed.

1365
01:33:19,176 --> 01:33:21,011
I would read the paper.

1366
01:33:21,178 --> 01:33:23,555
He'd read one of his thousand books.

1367
01:33:25,516 --> 01:33:27,517
I didn't deserve him.

1368
01:33:27,685 --> 01:33:29,853
I knew that...

1369
01:33:30,021 --> 01:33:32,063
...but I still loved him.

1370
01:33:38,571 --> 01:33:41,364
Did we all get shot today?

1371
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:46,494
Yeah, they said the city would be busy.

1372
01:33:46,662 --> 01:33:48,705
Every day like this?

1373
01:33:48,873 --> 01:33:50,749
Yeah, pretty much.

1374
01:33:50,916 --> 01:33:52,917
Great.

1375
01:33:53,085 --> 01:33:55,295
I wonder what's next.

1376
01:33:55,463 --> 01:33:57,005
Excuse me.

1377
01:34:08,726 --> 01:34:10,310
So how much?

1378
01:34:10,478 --> 01:34:14,397
Do you really think I'm gonna charge you after all that?

1379
01:34:14,565 --> 01:34:17,275
-Go on.
-Thanks.

1380
01:34:28,621 --> 01:34:30,413
Smell that?

1381
01:34:30,581 --> 01:34:32,248
What is that?

1382
01:34:32,416 --> 01:34:34,084
Well, when evidence is taken in...

1383
01:34:34,251 --> 01:34:37,253
...any physical contact can affect our ability to lift prints...

1384
01:34:37,421 --> 01:34:40,965
...so now to mark it, we just spray a scented solution right on the bill.

1385
01:34:48,974 --> 01:34:51,601
Lastly, I don't like the Pac 10.

1386
01:34:51,769 --> 01:34:53,728
It's overrated.

1387
01:35:06,367 --> 01:35:07,992
Where is it?

1388
01:35:29,265 --> 01:35:31,015
Shit.

1389
01:35:38,274 --> 01:35:40,900
This Lorenz is trying to tell us something.

1390
01:35:41,068 --> 01:35:43,486
Really? 
You don't say?

1391
01:35:47,825 --> 01:35:50,076
You ever heard of chaos theory?

1392
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:56,332
Edward Lorenz invented the chaos theory in the 1960s.

1393
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:58,793
It's the study of phenomena that appear random...

1394
01:35:58,961 --> 01:36:00,670
...but have an element of regularity...

1395
01:36:00,838 --> 01:36:02,672
...which can be described mathematically.

1396
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:06,259
-Try that again. -Pretty much, initial state of events...

1397
01:36:06,427 --> 01:36:10,138
...may seem unrelated and random, but eventually a pattern emerges...

1398
01:36:10,306 --> 01:36:12,849
...and in the end, all the pieces fit together.

1399
01:36:13,517 --> 01:36:15,685
You tried all of them?

1400
01:36:15,853 --> 01:36:18,521
Nothing for Conners or Lorenz?

1401
01:36:19,231 --> 01:36:21,483
I don't know.

1402
01:36:21,650 --> 01:36:24,360
No. Maybe--
Maybe he's not on a flight.

1403
01:36:28,199 --> 01:36:29,532
Try again...

1404
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:31,868
...but try Gleick, James Gleick.

1405
01:36:47,092 --> 01:36:49,719
I need to know if passenger James Gleick has checked in.

1406
01:36:49,887 --> 01:36:51,638
One moment.
We're gonna have to check.

1407
01:36:51,806 --> 01:36:53,723
Quickly, please.

1408
01:36:57,061 --> 01:36:58,102
Hello.

1409
01:36:58,270 --> 01:37:00,480
There's a passage in the Surangama Sutra...

1410
01:37:00,648 --> 01:37:02,690
...which roughly translated means:

1411
01:37:02,858 --> 01:37:06,778
"Things are not what they appear to be, nor are they otherwise."

1412
01:37:06,946 --> 01:37:08,279
Conners.

1413
01:37:08,447 --> 01:37:10,114
Think about that a minute.

1414
01:37:10,282 --> 01:37:12,909
Doesn't that blow your mind?

1415
01:37:15,162 --> 01:37:17,121
What gave me away?

1416
01:37:17,289 --> 01:37:18,832
Ten bucks.

1417
01:37:18,999 --> 01:37:20,200
Fuck. The diner.

1418
01:37:20,226 --> 01:37:21,276
That's right.

1419
01:37:21,418 --> 01:37:23,711
And it was Harry that gave up York.

1420
01:37:23,879 --> 01:37:25,421
Harry and a phone call.

1421
01:37:26,173 --> 01:37:29,092
He called me, said that Callo was insignificant...

1422
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:31,177
...threw up all kinds of red flags.

1423
01:37:31,345 --> 01:37:32,720
That wasn't him.

1424
01:37:32,888 --> 01:37:34,973
That, my friend, was my mistake.

1425
01:37:35,140 --> 01:37:36,975
I called you.

1426
01:37:37,142 --> 01:37:39,769
No, my wish is to catch you.

1427
01:37:39,937 --> 01:37:42,438
You're a murderer, a cop killer at that.

1428
01:37:42,606 --> 01:37:45,358
I didn't kill anyone who didn't deserve it.

1429
01:37:45,526 --> 01:37:47,569
Callo was insignificant.

1430
01:37:47,736 --> 01:37:51,114
You know, York always thought the plan was flawless.

1431
01:37:51,282 --> 01:37:55,451
If he'd only done what I said instead
of going off the deep end like he did.

1432
01:37:55,619 --> 01:37:58,288
I told him you have to leave room for error.

1433
01:37:58,455 --> 01:38:02,083
You know, you can't always predict how things are gonna play out.

1434
01:38:02,251 --> 01:38:05,378
A random camera catches an image of Damon Richards.

1435
01:38:05,546 --> 01:38:07,714
The scent on the money.

1436
01:38:07,882 --> 01:38:09,465
You.

1437
01:38:09,633 --> 01:38:11,092
The chaos theory.

1438
01:38:11,260 --> 01:38:13,511
When you got that, I was impressed.

1439
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:17,348
All day long we were trying to figure out who the inside source was.

1440
01:38:17,516 --> 01:38:19,142
It was you.

1441
01:38:19,310 --> 01:38:20,643
Surprise.

1442
01:38:20,811 --> 01:38:21,930
What if we cut the power?

1443
01:38:21,956 --> 01:38:23,254
That'll disable the system.

1444
01:38:23,397 --> 01:38:26,482
We can open the locks manually, go in that way.

1445
01:38:26,650 --> 01:38:27,942
That'll work.

1446
01:38:28,110 --> 01:38:31,029
A billion dollars is missing, and we're discovering this now?

1447
01:38:31,196 --> 01:38:33,323
Ironically, when you guys shut off the power...

1448
01:38:33,490 --> 01:38:36,075
...it helped hide the virus and bought it time to work.

1449
01:38:37,286 --> 01:38:40,038
Yeah, Teddy's pretty devastated about your death.

1450
01:38:40,205 --> 01:38:41,998
She'll get over it.

1451
01:38:54,803 --> 01:38:56,387
Get down!

1452
01:39:02,102 --> 01:39:04,187
Hey, where's Conners?

1453
01:39:41,558 --> 01:39:44,686
So the corpse in the morgue with your name on its toe?

1454
01:39:44,853 --> 01:39:48,189
Scott Curtis won't be bothering anyone again.

1455
01:39:48,357 --> 01:39:50,191
You're a serial killer.

1456
01:39:50,359 --> 01:39:53,069
Oh, yeah? 
Well, who got killed?

1457
01:39:54,321 --> 01:39:57,799
Curtis, Harrington, Galt, Lei.

1458
01:39:57,825 --> 01:40:00,143
All fucking hoods.

1459
01:40:01,036 --> 01:40:03,329
World's safer with them gone.

1460
01:40:03,497 --> 01:40:05,109
You said they were all hoods.

1461
01:40:05,135 --> 01:40:06,190
What about Callo?

1462
01:40:06,333 --> 01:40:08,376
Callo deserved his fate.

1463
01:40:08,544 --> 01:40:09,752
It's his fault.

1464
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:12,255
So this is all Callo's fault.

1465
01:40:12,423 --> 01:40:15,258
If it weren't for him, York and I would never have done this.

1466
01:40:15,426 --> 01:40:19,303
One random act causes another, causes another...

1467
01:40:19,471 --> 01:40:21,764
...and in the end, the pattern emerges.

1468
01:40:22,766 --> 01:40:24,851
That is the chaos theory.

1469
01:40:26,186 --> 01:40:28,354
Oh, look at that.

1470
01:40:28,522 --> 01:40:29,516
It's after 6.

1471
01:40:29,542 --> 01:40:31,121
The money's cleared.

1472
01:40:31,147 --> 01:40:32,675
I'm a wealthy man.

1473
01:40:32,818 --> 01:40:36,946
Lei, for all his evil, was one smart son of a bitch.

1474
01:40:37,114 --> 01:40:39,490
The feds will be tracing false leads for weeks.

1475
01:40:39,658 --> 01:40:42,118
You tanked Lei's trial on purpose.

1476
01:40:42,286 --> 01:40:45,079
They should have suspended me after I testified.

1477
01:40:45,247 --> 01:40:46,956
What did they expect?

1478
01:40:47,124 --> 01:40:48,036
So why not kill me?

1479
01:40:48,062 --> 01:40:49,692
You had plenty of opportunities.

1480
01:40:49,835 --> 01:40:51,377
This wasn't about killing, Shane.

1481
01:40:51,545 --> 01:40:53,546
This was about standing up for what matters.

1482
01:40:53,714 --> 01:40:57,050
Besides, you kind of grew on me.

1483
01:40:57,634 --> 01:40:59,152
You're not gonna get away.

1484
01:40:59,178 --> 01:41:00,286
I already have.

1485
01:41:00,429 --> 01:41:01,554
I'm not even here now.

1486
01:41:01,722 --> 01:41:03,931
This is a very valuable lesson for you to learn.

1487
01:41:04,099 --> 01:41:05,446
It's good you have learned it.

1488
01:41:05,472 --> 01:41:06,459
Yeah? 
What's that?

1489
01:41:06,602 --> 01:41:08,561
You don't always win.

1490
01:41:08,729 --> 01:41:11,147
All your years of service for nothing.

1491
01:41:11,315 --> 01:41:12,732
You're a hypocrite.

1492
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:14,609
I'm an opportunist.

1493
01:41:14,777 --> 01:41:18,654
I would have gladly died in the line of duty, but they took that away.

1494
01:41:18,822 --> 01:41:22,325
They'd been as faithful to me, none of this would have happened.

1495
01:41:22,493 --> 01:41:25,369
The system broke down.

1496
01:41:25,537 --> 01:41:27,789
Good luck, detective.

1497
01:41:27,956 --> 01:41:30,958
It would have been an interesting partnership.

1498
01:41:31,126 --> 01:41:33,002
But I have to go now.

1499
01:41:36,381 --> 01:41:37,965
Conners.

1500
01:41:38,133 --> 01:41:39,675
Conners.

1501
01:41:42,471 --> 01:41:43,596
Attention, please.

1502
01:41:43,764 --> 01:41:45,040
Final call.

1503
01:41:45,066 --> 01:41:50,169
Flight 1182 to Mexico City now boarding at gate 23.

1504
01:41:56,527 --> 01:41:58,945
Enjoy your flight.

1505
01:42:29,977 --> 01:42:31,102
Thank you.

1506
01:42:31,270 --> 01:42:34,397
I'll let the captain know we're ready.
