1
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,093
I want it with you.

2
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,935
I could be in your hotel
in 10 minutes.

3
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,529
10:00 tonight?

4
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,049
Yes, of course.

5
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,249
I come when you want,
You know.

6
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,979
I'm here for you.

7
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,895
I want to feel you in me.

8
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,052
I want you to fuck me.

9
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,058
I may be coming soon.

10
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,816
No, I understand.

11
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,414
On this evening.

12
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,769
George?

13
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,849
This is Lucy. Hello.

14
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,368
I miss you.
If you arrived?

15
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,379
I'm home in bed
and I think of you.

16
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,258
I kept thinking about you.
I want to feel you in me.

17
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,936
I do not want to wait.

18
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,099
You want what?
Tell me.

19
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,374
I want to.

20
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,858
I arrived a few minutes.

21
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,619
You know what I want.

22
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,699
Yes, you have told me.

23
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,649
I never do.

24
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,176
You just do not want?

25
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,533
With you, though.

26
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,530
I do not know how to say it, but...

27
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,212
You're not like all the others.

28
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,658
I feel these things with you.

29
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,456
I do not feel normal.

30
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,735
There.

31
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,688
Touch me.

32
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,017
You see.
You really missed.

33
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,057
It will be 500 this time, okay?

34
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:37,856
Good.

35
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,056
<i>Lucy, Bob.</i>
<i>I'm late.</i>

36
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,728
<i>I am in the Goodwin Hotel.</i>
<i>Remember me.</i>

37
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,170
<i>Claire, Mrs. Peña</i>
<i>nurses.</i>

38
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,895
<i>Phone me as soon as possible.</i>
<i>It is very important.</i>

39
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,859
<i>Home care "Rosemont."</i>

40
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,209
Ms. Peña, please.

41
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,012
- <i>Who is calling?</i>
- Claire Dolan.

42
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,494
<i>One moment, please.</i>

43
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,610
<i>Ms. Peña to the device.</i>

44
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,535
<i>I've got bad news.</i>

45
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,934
<i>Your mother died.</i>

46
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,013
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

47
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,733
When she died?

48
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,296
<i>At 10:52 this morning.</i>

49
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,379
He suffered?

50
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,730
<i>No, he went very quickly.</i>

51
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,329
Lucy?

52
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,171
One moment, please.

53
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,853
I for one second.

54
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,130
I gotta go.
I have a promise.

55
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,693
I came.

56
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,339
<i>If you want to</i>
<i>left in his room</i>

57
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,973
<i>Come quickly.</i>

58
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,139
I am now.

59
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,492
<i>This is going to go?</i>

60
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,852
Ira. Thank you.

61
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,619
<i>Are you sure?</i>

62
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,052
I must leave you.
At what time it was.

63
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,411
Sorry I made you wait.

64
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,849
I gotta go.
I have a promise.

65
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,378
It was great.

66
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,375
Call me when you get back.

67
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,493
I want you again.

68
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,974
Promised.

69
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,612
I will miss you...

70
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:04,373
This will be a long time?
I have a very important undertaking.

71
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,491
Minutes.

72
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,618
On behalf of Mr Roland Cain

73
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:13,335
that the invoice was issued.
Is that true?

74
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,534
I would prefer to resolve itself.

75
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,968
They send the bill?

76
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,408
Yes, please.

77
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,249
Would you tell Mr Cain
death?

78
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,769
Like you?

79
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,857
No, I do it myself.

80
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,570
Not to be told.
I want to tell her own.

81
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,248
I understand.
No one contacted.

82
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,137
Can you see
in the image?

83
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,978
I do not want weird.

84
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,130
This copy for you.

85
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,253
I will try
managing your mom?

86
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,939
Will not be long.

87
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,219
4000, right?

88
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,419
$ 1,000 interest for a week.
Rest for your debt.

89
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,374
Beautiful, yes?

90
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,174
Very nice.

91
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,610
Hungary.

92
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,734
That just happened.

93
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,250
And your mother?

94
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,769
He was fine, thank you.

95
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,333
He likes his room?

96
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:30,011
I want him to be the best.
I was there Thursday.

97
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,337
I'm sure
He has his own room.

98
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,168
He talks about you?

99
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,856
I understand.
He absorbed

100
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,209
by your visit.

101
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,819
That's right, mother.

102
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,130
I'm happy.

103
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,413
He deserves to be happy.

104
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,892
Convey my regards to him

105
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,649
and tell him that I think about it
when you see it.

106
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,729
Do you?

107
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,170
Of course, thank you.

108
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,330
It makes me happy.

109
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,048
Be careful, Claire.

110
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,811
Yes, thank you.

111
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,298
Grant him eternal rest,
Dear God,

112
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,173
and your light
the light forever.

113
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,257
I hope he rest in peace.

114
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,529
Amen.

115
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,299
May his soul
and that of all the missing

116
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,297
rest in the grace of God.

117
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,609
Peace of God
that passes all understanding,

118
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,051
Guard your heart and your mind
the love of God

119
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,214
and His Son, our Lord,
Jesus Christ.

120
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,056
May God Almighty bless you,

121
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,490
Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

122
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,652
He is in heaven.
Have faith in God.

123
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,418
Thank you very much, Father.

124
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,969
God bless you.

125
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,899
I buried my mother today.

126
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,490
A drink?

127
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,570
Okay.

128
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,849
You drink?

129
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,778
A Johnny Walker, sec.

130
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,490
Boy, two Johnny Walker.

131
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:43,970
Without ice.

132
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,688
Double contrast.

133
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,379
A double for women.

134
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:01,931
Other.

135
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,173
Another woman.

136
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,891
I've never seen here.

137
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,416
I have not been here.

138
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,214
What's your name?

139
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,895
Clear.

140
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,858
This is a beautiful name.

141
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,538
You're a beautiful woman.

142
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,055
I like you.

143
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,052
I want it with you.

144
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,335
Boy, the same thing.

145
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,895
It is for me.

146
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,612
You are attractive.

147
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,213
And if we go

148
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,978
in a more quiet?

149
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,928
Anyone?

150
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,613
You're really beautiful.

151
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,851
If we are going home?

152
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,369
Let's go.

153
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,813
You got something to drink?

154
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,171
Dress up and transmit.

155
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,976
- How?
- Go!

156
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,459
Gross! You understand?

157
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,295
Fuck you!

158
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,219
Bitch!

159
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,379
This is 2500.

160
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:49,810
And your mother?

161
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,134
He was good, thanks.

162
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,212
You go back to see it?

163
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,457
Yes, he asked me
thank you for the room.

164
00:16:59,020 --> 00:16:59,896
Sorry.

165
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,252
Never mind, do not worry.

166
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,731
- An accident.
- This is my fault.

167
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,498
It was an accident, Claire.

168
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,496
What is it?

169
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,975
How?

170
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,933
You look nervous.

171
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,170
No, it was fine.

172
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,455
Show your hands.

173
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,334
I just had a little cold.

174
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,412
Ever shake my hand.

175
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,935
You're lying to me?

176
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,496
Why?
I work, there.

177
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,169
When you see your mother?

178
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,609
Last night.

179
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,458
He likes his room?

180
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,773
What did she say?

181
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,889
We were lucky
to have such generous friends.

182
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,692
Having their own room

183
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,654
it was good, the lack of
Privacy she weighed.

184
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,010
And he sends greetings.

185
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,851
I'm happy to help.

186
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,979
You look tired.

187
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,573
Try to relax.

188
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,528
I will try. Thank you.

189
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,895
Be careful, Claire.

190
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:17,890
Yes. I will rest tonight.
Thank you.

191
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,529
<i>Leave a message after the beep.</i>

192
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,771
<i>Your take.</i>

193
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,649
<i>Claire?</i>

194
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,254
<i>Are you there?</i>

195
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,456
Lost?

196
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,337
You from?

197
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,696
Leave me.

198
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,571
If not?

199
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,974
You feel alone?

200
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,935
- No
- I do.

201
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,614
I need company.

202
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,733
You do.

203
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,010
Very funny.

204
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,053
You're wrong.

205
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:36,013
Really? I do not think.

206
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,332
I do.

207
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,178
You have asked your opinion?

208
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,650
What name do not you?

209
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,811
- Never mind!
- I prefer it.

210
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,015
Prettier than you.

211
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,335
I do not care.

212
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:53,737
Really? You will leave
go first?

213
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,137
Mary?

214
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,256
Claire Dolan is thy cousin.

215
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,539
<i>Already a century.</i>

216
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,209
<i>How are you?</i>

217
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,978
My mother recently passed away.

218
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,333
He has a brain tumor.

219
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,338
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>How old is he?</i>

220
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,529
58.

221
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:45,411
I am in Newark.
I think we can see.

222
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:48,009
<i>Excuse me.</i>
<i>Do not leave...</i>

223
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,570
<i>You say?</i>

224
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,490
I'm in Newark
and I saw you.

225
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,658
<i>Come tomorrow.</i>
<i>I gave my address.</i>

226
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,848
I have it, it is in the directory.

227
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,494
<i>Two hours, that you okay?</i>

228
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,815
Perfect.

229
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,933
How are you?

230
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:12,655
<i>Good. "I have a 3 year old daughter</i>
<i>'M is not that bad.</i>

231
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,135
This is incredible.
His name?

232
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,409
<i>Siobhan.</i>

233
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,612
<i>I gotta go.</i>
<i>See you tomorrow without fail?</i>

234
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,775
Without error.

235
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,658
<i>Tomorrow, then.</i>

236
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,289
... Who knows what could happen...

237
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,373
... She is beautiful...

238
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,933
... You know?

239
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,334
... Three hours in the morning...

240
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,456
... They had been drinking all night...

241
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,972
... He asked for it...

242
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:23,928
I like my natural color,
but I want to try the more clearly.

243
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,808
Too late to go back,
now.

244
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,170
You would be awesome.

245
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,937
If it is not fun you are,
We take your color.

246
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,811
Claire, the call for you.

247
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,533
Are you sorry?

248
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,609
<i>Lucy?</i>

249
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,010
You are responsible for
or waiting for someone?

250
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:37,856
I am alone.

251
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,011
Want to dance?

252
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,819
I love to dance.

253
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,498
- So?
- Sorry to be late.

254
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:17,488
What the head! Ms Raynor
awaits you. Do not repeat.

255
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,772
Did you set the
and treatment of Mrs. Raynor.

256
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,095
Immediately.

257
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,776
He is cute...
What's his name?

258
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:48,969
Sadie.

259
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,779
He was so small.

260
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,374
Michelle, we will.

261
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,898
You down?

262
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,374
I do not know what a.

263
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,852
It was not connected.

264
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,130
He returned, he said nothing.

265
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,533
He ate, he said nothing.

266
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,858
He sees information
he went to bed.

267
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,854
He said nothing.

268
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,179
And it does not get better.

269
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,130
I do not know...

270
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,735
Still far away from me.

271
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,090
Color "pearl"

272
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,455
I am okay?

273
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,610
Your opinion?

274
00:30:58,860 --> 00:30:59,656
Pardon?

275
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,969
"Mother," I am good?

276
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,016
your mascara runs.

277
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:09,656
Pardon?

278
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,569
your mascara runs.

279
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,134
You feel good?

280
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,653
It does not go.

281
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:32,812
Are you sorry?
Cathy will solve your nails.

282
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,974
What do you do?

283
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,379
I drive a taxi.

284
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,251
Do you like it?

285
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,448
It works.

286
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,978
You work for a company?

287
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,852
No, the taxi was mine.

288
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,372
My beauty.

289
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,931
In the show South Park Street.

290
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,296
Do you like it?

291
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,090
I went.

292
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,695
I'm late.

293
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,018
I gave my phone number.

294
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,494
I have.

295
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,052
I noted
when you are asleep.

296
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,297
I often work
near Royalton.

297
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,215
You can find me there.

298
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,688
I'll call you.

299
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,370
Look at me.

300
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,809
Where your money?

301
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,571
On the coffee table.

302
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,456
I brought your clothes.

303
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:17,257
Please,
and put their makeup.

304
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:21,849
Please.

305
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,659
Put yourself in the light.

306
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,774
I'm really sorry

307
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,572
to your mother.

308
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,332
It was a good woman.

309
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,578
I will miss him.

310
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,538
You friend Roland?

311
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,575
- What is your name?
- Lucy.

312
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,850
He says Claire.
This is your real name?

313
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,095
From where in Ireland your home?

314
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,128
Dublin.

315
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,178
I went there last year.

316
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,497
The people are very friendly.

317
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:34,696
I do not know,
They invited me to eat at home.

318
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,809
They share a moment
short but intense

319
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,612
they live with me.

320
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:45,498
This is embarrassing
for me than for you.

321
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,693
Maybe I can help you.

322
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:48,651
How?

323
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,337
What

324
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,575
do you want?

325
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,294
You do not know, eh?

326
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,419
Why are you doing this?

327
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,938
To make you happy.

328
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,449
We do not know.

329
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,858
You do not really want.

330
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,170
Debt?

331
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,293
It was not.

332
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,850
I understand.

333
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:25,093
For the money, I do things
I hate it.

334
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,211
The tear-strip in.

335
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:30,737
I'm learning to promote,
to protect me.

336
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:35,056
The worst
I always wondered,

337
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,613
I'd put that
in this situation.

338
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:43,699
I do not know what is inside me
which led me to accept these things.

339
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:47,695
I think long
different, much worse.

340
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,851
I have anyone to
turn to find my bearings.

341
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:54,859
It took many years to tell me
I'm not a monster.

342
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:59,177
Many people do things
the tears,

343
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,939
they hate.

344
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,333
You understand?

345
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,537
Just try not to think about.

346
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,053
Zac are you?

347
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,778
My name is Lucy.
I am a friend of Cain.

348
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,251
He asked me to contact you,

349
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,451
I would love
caring for you.

350
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,491
Do you want me to come?

351
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,853
It's free.

352
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,495
Cain said
than you.

353
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,611
I really would love to meet you.

354
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,898
I want to please you.

355
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,210
I'm 27, I'm 1.72 m.

356
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:11,095
Brown eyes
and brown hair.

357
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,292
I think I'll humor you.

358
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,575
I'm happy
to change the color.

359
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,134
At 7:00?

360
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,379
At what time it was.

361
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:02,937
<i>Lucy, Mark. It is 07:10.</i>

362
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,734
<i>Remember me. You got my number.</i>
<i>I want to see you.</i>

363
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:33,179
Where do you want to go?

364
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,257
Anywhere, I do not care.

365
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:39,579
Excuse me.

366
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:42,494
Maybe I got sick,
You work.

367
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,538
It was not. Do not worry.

368
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:48,219
You okay?

369
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:52,417
I just want to see you.

370
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:57,339
What is it?
I went to the last hotel

371
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:59,253
I was told that you go.

372
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:02,250
Where you live,
now?

373
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,814
Stop.

374
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:05,533
- Now.
- Where are you?

375
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,056
"I must go.
I call.

376
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,218
I can take you anywhere you want!

377
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,739
I'll call you.

378
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,179
How did you find me?

379
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:37,814
Can I come?

380
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,253
You live here
old?

381
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,056
You live here?

382
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,173
Claire is your name?

383
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:11,500
- And your name?
- Dolan.

384
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:23,173
- What do you do in Newark?
- How did you find it?

385
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:26,497
I followed the cab yesterday.

386
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:31,977
I see you left this morning,

387
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:34,296
I have followed
to Parke Hotel.

388
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:39,337
I waited a few hours,
I do not see you.

389
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:45,171
I'm tired of waiting.

390
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:52,375
I moved here a little earlier,
You do not have.

391
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:04,337
You're a pimp?

392
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:08,451
I owe someone money.

393
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:26,739
Okay?

394
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:32,579
You enjoy?

395
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:39,819
This can not be seen?

396
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,653
I have enjoyed.

397
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:04,575
Okay?

398
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:07,735
Okay.

399
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,773
I can not accept it,
I have to work.

400
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:39,453
You have received a check?
I told her Friday.

401
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:45,049
We will fix.

402
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:49,688
I'll call you.
We try to organize.

403
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:51,853
I gotta go.

404
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:55,212
Tell Angela
I see you tomorrow.

405
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:58,653
<i>Lucy, Aaron.</i>
<i>I want to see you.</i>

406
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:02,136
<i>I'm in Cornwall</i>
<i>Room 227. See you soon.</i>

407
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:06,696
<i>I'm John Williams</i>
<i>a friend Jed.</i>

408
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:08,971
<i>He told me to contact you...</i>

409
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:39,209
No

410
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:40,934
Not that.

411
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:01,218
That's it.

412
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:35,532
This is Claire.

413
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:39,411
I do not know whether in your home
in Newark.

414
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:41,935
Call me
when you receive this message.

415
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:44,019
I miss you.

416
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:59,848
Do not go.
I want to talk.

417
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:02,978
Talk about what?

418
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:08,253
I feel you're worried
I was not supposed to.

419
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:11,370
Is that all?

420
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:15,057
If there is something
You want me to say...

421
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:17,494
Like it?

422
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:23,336
If ever you disturb something,
You can talk to me.

423
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:25,339
I'm here for you.

424
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:28,419
Everything is good.

425
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:33,609
Okay, with your mother?

426
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:37,575
Is there anything else?

427
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:41,932
This is for you.

428
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,570
Do not tell your mother.

429
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:47,775
Buy it alone.

430
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:50,209
Thank you, Elton.

431
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:02,414
See you soon!

432
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:14,338
Sorry too late.

433
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:19,935
- And a job?
- It.

434
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:25,212
You're long gone?

435
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:26,976
One hour.

436
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:31,136
Just coffee, thanks.

437
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:37,408
You are beautiful.

438
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:50,571
I want you to take it.

439
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:54,570
It is committed to you for nothing.

440
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:57,496
I want to help pay
Your debt.

441
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:04,975
... Heather... velar

442
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:08,092
always ready to kiss
tell you that the pants down.

443
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:11,258
Even as he called
grandmother!

444
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:14,657
Everything you would expect:
She will suck, lick your ass.

445
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:17,294
You can fuck,
it was good.

446
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:21,250
It has been two days
we see thee not.

447
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:24,978
I'm sick. Influenza.

448
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:27,138
- There is an epidemic.
- You have a customer.

449
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:28,329
Over.

450
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:41,853
Seven hundred.

451
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:49,377
Thousands.

452
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:56,889
I "clean".

453
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,058
And if I really was not?

454
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:00,818
I took the risk.

455
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:05,138
Your take.
Thousands of dollars are not any.

456
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:08,335
I do not ejaculate in you
if you want.

457
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:12,611
I just want to feel.
You are very beautiful.

458
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:16,292
Sorry, I'm not interested.

459
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,855
So what?
I do not waste my time!

460
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:20,609
No problem.

461
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:21,332
Pardon?

462
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:24,850
I said "No problem".

463
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:26,095
Out, bitch!

464
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:14,013
And work?

465
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:15,893
That's okay.

466
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:17,616
And you?

467
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:19,295
That's okay.

468
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,931
I want a child.

469
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:40,853
Are you sure?

470
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:52,619
I understand.

471
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:54,970
Really?

472
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:02,051
It happens.

473
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:23,615
I want to feel you in me.

474
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:27,699
I love you.

475
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:34,252
I also love you.

476
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:06,618
Stop there.

477
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:17,409
This is $ 17.50.

478
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:21,177
You pay before you start!

479
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:24,055
I will pay you.

480
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:29,128
- Before Download!
- Fuck!

481
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:33,697
You think I'm not going to pay you?
Why? Would not be?

482
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:35,652
Open, I'll pay you!

483
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:40,209
Cutting machine!

484
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:41,569
Keys!

485
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:45,099
If you see me, you die.
Money!

486
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:47,211
All the money, or you die!

487
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:48,978
Fuck you get it?

488
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:53,539
I give everything.
Do not kill me!

489
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:56,169
Gun it.

490
01:03:57,340 --> 01:03:57,817
Gun it!

491
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:00,495
Please...

492
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:02,489
Close your eyes!

493
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:08,416
I do not mind?
I have to call.

494
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:10,929
Do not worry.
I'm glad to see you.

495
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:12,334
You okay?

496
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:14,653
This is for Siobhan.

497
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:18,613
A place of paint.
I hope she likes.

498
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:21,095
I was told that it's like
a lot.

499
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:23,376
She will love. Thank you very much.

500
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:25,819
Where are you?

501
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:28,859
I returned to New York
Not yet.

502
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:30,255
Why?

503
01:05:31,420 --> 01:05:32,296
Claire?

504
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,297
Not long.

505
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:37,450
- You okay?
- Yes.

506
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:38,979
Are you sure?

507
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:44,535
You are pregnant, right?

508
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:49,295
That's why you go?

509
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:53,452
You're going to keep it?

510
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:57,177
So, congratulations!

511
01:05:57,820 --> 01:05:59,811
I'm happy for you.

512
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:02,734
Better
I will let you work.

513
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:07,213
I will miss you,
and Siobhan also.

514
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:09,217
He claims you.

515
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:11,172
Kiss her for me.

516
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:13,613
I'll come find you.

517
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:16,374
Every 8 or 15 days.

518
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:20,016
You will always be accepted.

519
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:24,089
If you need something,
call me. You hear?

520
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:26,129
Promised.

521
01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:46,008
You look tired.

522
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:48,688
How long have you saved?

523
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:50,573
Two, three years maybe?

524
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:54,820
What you will do
when you are broken?

525
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:57,491
Brader your cat to $ 20 a shot?

526
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:01,691
You're not the novice.

527
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:04,211
You do not have to leave
You take

528
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:06,092
and attack you like that.

529
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:09,498
Use your head.

530
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:31,730
I have to go some day.

531
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:33,498
One thing I have to face.

532
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:34,689
What?

533
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:37,540
A value for the finish.

534
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:40,855
I should
2 days, not more.

535
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:46,770
He fell sick, I know.

536
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:50,373
I'll be there for you promise
doctor.

537
01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:52,698
I'll call you.

538
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:54,458
I go back whenever I can.

539
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:27,335
Enter.

540
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:29,289
Peter?

541
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:31,893
I'm Eva.

542
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:35,414
Wait
old?

543
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:37,690
No, I've just arrived.

544
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:40,379
You drink something?

545
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:41,808
I will.

546
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:50,974
Where are you from?

547
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:53,129
Budapest.

548
01:08:58,140 --> 01:08:59,414
You are here
since when?

549
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:01,299
9 weeks.

550
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:04,258
You have a beautiful face.

551
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:06,612
- What do you like best?
- How?

552
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:10,335
Total? Anything else?
I can do anything.

553
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:12,658
What is it?

554
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:17,934
- Kiss, you love it?
- You, I like you.

555
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:19,209
Would you like to kiss?

556
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:26,093
You like?

557
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:28,139
Whatever.

558
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:31,937
- But what?
- You suck.

559
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:36,249
Why?

560
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:39,294
I want you to suck.
You like it?

561
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:01,973
I waited.

562
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:10,093
I repeat, listen.

563
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:12,529
Even if he must,

564
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:13,934
it will never stop.

565
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:17,012
I know
since he was 12 years old.

566
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:20,497
I already knew
it sucks.

567
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:23,972
He was born to a prostitute, whore she will die.

568
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:41,293
I was offered a drink.

569
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:43,854
Two whiskey.

570
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:47,338
Difficult, but try to accept
I said.

571
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:51,295
Your life will be happier.

572
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:54,130
It is time for you to take control.

573
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:56,012
You're not children.

574
01:13:06,140 --> 01:13:07,732
Four hundred, according to the agreement.

575
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:12,729
- A tape?
- A good idea.

576
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:40,488
Leave open.

577
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:43,818
- It is not too cold?
- No, it's nice.

578
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:51,259
I ask this.

579
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:01,334
You live in New York?

580
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:04,737
I was thinking about leaving.
Maybe Seattle.

581
01:18:05,660 --> 01:18:06,570
You have money?

582
01:18:06,940 --> 01:18:08,419
Ira.

583
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:16,214
Take, for babies.

584
01:18:17,740 --> 01:18:19,298
You're going to keep it?

585
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:24,254
As results
can be complex

586
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:27,179
and make... doubt.

587
01:18:28,460 --> 01:18:29,813
Uncertainty.

588
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:31,409
I'm sure.

589
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:32,974
I'm happy.

590
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:36,333
You give a very good mother.

591
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:42,219
Take the money.

592
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:43,776
Gift.

593
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:45,090
Accept it.

594
01:18:45,580 --> 01:18:47,298
Thank you, but I do not want to...

595
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:48,774
It is very touching me.

596
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:54,096
I do not want.

597
01:18:59,540 --> 01:19:01,690
I do not understand.

598
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:05,493
But if you do not want my help,
no problem.

599
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:07,099
Up to you.

600
01:19:10,540 --> 01:19:12,974
I'm not talking in general
I feel...

601
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:17,051
But know that death
angry mom

602
01:19:17,940 --> 01:19:20,170
and I share your pain.

603
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:26,732
If I can do anything
for you or your child,

604
01:19:27,620 --> 01:19:29,611
I hope you will give me a sign.

605
01:19:31,060 --> 01:19:32,254
Sure.

606
01:19:32,660 --> 01:19:33,695
I hope.

607
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:37,498
Be careful, Claire.

608
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:39,499
Do not worry.

609
01:20:36,820 --> 01:20:37,935
Do not stop!

610
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:21,453
We were flying

611
01:22:22,180 --> 01:22:26,731
Other Seattle to 17.05.
The next flight

01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:41,570
Sorry. You look like
